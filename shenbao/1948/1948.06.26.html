<h3>何應欽在立院稱　開封之陷出於意外　影響中原戰局尙微</h3>
<p>〔中央社南京廿五日電〕國防部何部長應欽廿四日在立院臨時秘密會議對最近中原戰事有所說明，其報告詞頃經立法院秘書處加以整理發表（報告詞大要已刋昨日本報）。</p>
<p>據何氏稱：關於此次中原戰事，最高統帥及參謀部所有幕僚人員，對於作戰之策劃，及兵團行動之指導，自始迄今，殫精竭慮，期於此次戰役中捕提陳·劉兩匪主力，予以聚殲，以奠定華中剿匪軍事形勢，開封之戰，實乃此次會戰過程中之一部份，該城如不失陷，則收效當然較快，不幸失陷，對於會戰之進行不無影響，但無甚大妨害。過去陝西方面，寶鷄失陷而彭匪主力被我消滅於隴東，並迅即收復寶鷄及其他各縣，此即一例。開封爲河南省會，公敎人員及人民甚多，應予特別堅守，參謀部配備於開封之兵力，原有國軍三國，保安隊六圑，臨時又加入國軍一圑，共十個圑，原期至少能守十天以上，預計我援軍舉破沿途匪軍，到達開封城外，則不需十天，在開封地區之內外夾擊定可形成，不料匪於十七日開始攻城，十八日即突破城關，發生巷戰，此事實出意外，參謀部得此消息後，顧總長即飛往鄭州最高統帥亦飛往巡視，期能使援軍早日到達，終以開封城被匪突破太快，援軍趕救不及，至廿二日城內電訊中斷，情况不明。</p>

<h3>劉茂恩脫險　已安抵蘭卦</h3>
<p>〔本報徐州廿五日電〕豫主席劉茂恩於廿四日下午穴時安抵蘭封。</p>

<h3>膠濟西段再度奏捷　國軍進駐龍山　津浦路前鋒已進至界首附近</h3>
<p>〔本報濟南廿五日電〕膠濟西段國軍再捷，廿三日晚起，匪以第九，及渤海兩縱隊曁土八路，企圖突學濟南外圍，經國軍採取機動戰術，於廿四日黃昏前將匪誘至歷城郭店間有利地區後，守軍在大量援軍曁砲空協同下，向匪開始全面反擊，一時機砲聲隆隆濟南全市可聞。至二十四夜十一時許，匪卒不支，向東潰竄，截至廿五日午後，追擊國軍前鋒已進駐龍山，匪分向明水章邱方面逃竄。由濟南沿津浦路兩側南下國軍，廿五日續由萬德向南出擊，至午前鋒己進至界首附近，軍方判斷泰安不日可下。兗州戰事廿四日晚十時起益烈，匪以人海戰術向城北郊猛撲達十餘次，俱經擊退，二十五晨起戰事稍趨緩和。</p>

<h3>秦皇島外圍匪軍西移　昌黎展開保衛戰　國軍堅守城坦苦撑待援</h3>
<p>〔本報秦皇島廿五日電〕冀東廿五日戰事以秦皇島北戴河間最烈，國軍於中午攻下秦島西南十公里外鐵道北之慕義寨，繼續繞攻北戴河東北之蔡各莊，匪已被包圍。秦皇島外圍廿四日交起，槍砲聲已遠，匪十一縱隊攻泰島外圍部隊西移，與圍攻昌黎匪相會合，猛攻昌黎，昌黎守軍實力較弱，與匪於外圍血戰後，昏暮撤離北山高地及城郊碉堡，堅守城池。匪之砲火猛烈，城內損害頗大，並多處起火，與此間已失聯絡，二十五晨仍無確切消息，據判斷，守軍似入地道內苦撑，以待援軍。昌黎以西後封台，安山，石門等站，廿四日被匪攻陷，灤河大鐵橋則在國軍守護下得告無恙。廿五日晨由葫蘆島開抵秦島援軍一支登陸後，即由秦島推進，路方搶修車亦出動搶修，以搶救昌黎。</p>

<h3>質問洩漏秘密會消息　立院起軒然大波　決組臨時委會加以澈查</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿五日電〕立法院廿五日晨會議中，因南京新民報登載該院廿四日秘密會議檢討軍事經過，將會議秘密洩露無遺，引起軒然大波。此問題首由相菊潭於報告事項進行完畢後口頭提出。陳克文·張道行分別指出日前財政·金融外交兩委會秘密會議消息亦屢有洩露，應同加注意，其他各發言委員均主澈查消息自何處走漏，並譴責新民報對此等秘密消息之記載技術偏頗，別有用心，甚至有謂立院中已有共匪尾巴份子或第三國際間諜混入者，秘書長張　元乃即請准孫院長起立聲明：廿四日會議時絕對無任何新聞記　在塲採訪，會議速記人員向例嚴禁與新聞記者接觸，且保證如秘書處有　職情事，願負全責，希望委員組會澈查，以明責任。至此，各委員攻擊目標益集中於女委員鄧季惺一人，吳望伋主調閱該條新聞原稿，辨認筆跡，謝澄字謂：新民報記載，將每一委員發言內容寫出，決非會外人士所能爲，並指責鄧季　本人「嚴禁空軍盲目轟炸城市。」臨時動　亦顯著刋出，尤足影響士氣民心。鄧氏爲此發言辨白，復遭會中噓斥，孫院長乃宣告休息，以平紛擾。旋續會，經孫院長說明應許鄧氏有發言機會，但謂：「鄧委員請站在委員地位發言，不要站在報館老闆娘的立塲發言」。鄧氏乃辯謂，渠雖爲南京新民報負責人，但不能因自己爲委員即禁止記者採訪，且關於秘密會議消息，廿五日並非僅新民報一家刋登，張道藩則稱，不問何人走漏秘密消息，均須澈查，否則長此以往，立院難免貽幼稚糊塗之議，且新聞自由乃有限度者，應同時咨請政院負責追究報紙新聞來源。旋女委員譚惕吾發言，爲鄧氏辯護，以態度傲慢，說理牽强，且强調男委員不應欺侮女委員，遭多數男女委員斥責。至此，會衆要求停止討論，表決結果，終將此事交臨時委會進行調查。最後孫院長起立致詞，略謂：新民報固有採訪興登載自由，但軍事秘密爲國家安全所繫，每一國民均有不能洩露之義務，新民報標題明稱：「立院軍事秘密會議」，何可肆意宣揚，應知在此軍事嚴重之戡亂時間，以軍事機密洩露於一叛亂之敵人，實屬危險，否則何必舉行秘密會議，渠希望在塲委員，記者及各報館老闆均注意此事，以盡國民義務，協助政府保密。最後以三〇九票（在塲委員四三五人）之贊成，通過由廿一常設委會各推一人，組臨時委會（由刑法委會推出委員任召集人）加以澈查。</p>

<h3>杜威當選美總統候選人</h3>
<p>美國共和黨全國大會於廿四日晚投票選舉總統候選人，參加競選者，有紐約州長杜威，參議員塔虎脫，實業家史泰森，外交家范登堡，加州州長擊倫曁東京盟軍總司令麥帥，他們都是美國第一流人物，不特人人均爲共和黨內衆望所歸，而且亦爲美國國內外人士所屬望的總統候選人。雖在第一次投票，第二次投票時，沒有一個獲得過半數，但及至第三次投票時，因次多數均放棄競選，始由杜威獲得一〇九四票當選，沒有一人投反對票。這實在是杜威的無上榮譽，使杜魯門總統也不能不認爲其唯一的勁敵了。</p>
<p>我們在「美國政治季節的開始」一文中，曾分析美國的政局及各黨競選的情勢；並指出今年總統競選，以共和黨爲較有希望，惟共和黨內人才濟濟，究將由何人爲未來的白宮主人，却未敢貿然指出。現由杜威當選爲共和黨的總統候選人，在杜威必自信將入白宮執政。誠然，在內政外交的政策上，民主黨與共和黨沒有多大差異，不論杜魯門也好，杜威也好，美國的國策在原則上是不會有重大的變動的，杜魯門總統也曾對蘇聯表示過，不論今年大選的結果如何，對蘇政策是不會改變的。不過在推行國策時，終不免有輕重緩急之分。所以我們對於杜威的對華觀感，特別感覺到興趣。</p>
<p>記得今年二三月間，正當美國朝野熱烈討論援歐援華孰先的時候，杜威曾發表一個「對華政策」宣言，主張在經濟上應該積極援助中國，旦經美國共和黨全國協會通過，送呈杜魯門總統及國會。杜威並在宣言中，抨擊民主黨的對華政策，他說：「杜魯門政府不僅缺乏促進和平之政策，反而處處助長蘇聯侵略世界之力量。在遠東方面，美國政府不惜犧牲中國，與史太林成立妥協，使其得以控制中國的東北」。最近杜威在各地發表競選演說，也無不以此爲言。五月廿六日他在紐約演說稱：「吾人對於中國所需要之援助，復靳而不予，吾人誠不能贏取永久之和平也」。所以我們展望將來，美國對華政策無論如何，祗有益趨積極，只要我們能在「自力更生」的原則之下，自强不息，社威如果一旦當選總統，當不會使我們失望的。</p>
<h3>收縮銀根與限制發行</h3>
<p>昨日上海市塲，物價瘋狂上漲，下午門市米價幾叩兩千萬元大關，各種主要商品，也均漲二三成不等，人心皇皇，不可終日，但迄執筆時止，尚未聞中樞當局有什麼緊急措施的準備，好像看見這匹脫　野馬，束手無策，聽其狂奔。不但升斗小民將愈感生存的威脅·就是一般人也都感覺到政府千萬不能再事因循敷衍的了。</p>
<p>據金融有關方面表示，政府自將仍致力於抽緊銀根，而拋售美援物資即爲其主要方法，甚至說只要拋出六千萬美元的物資即可收回全部法幣，一若樂觀得很。但願如此，那麼爲什麼不就拋售呢？其次，則爲推銷庫券，但成效如何，有目共睹。我們以爲眞要收縮銀根應從立即限制通貨發行入手。</p>
<p>說到短期庫券的推銷，先行試辦者，爲甲乙兩種。而丙種期限定爲一星期，實際等於業經禁止之遊交，所不同者，一爲股票，一爲庫券而巳。我們要研究庫券遞交恢復之後，其銷路是否會突飛猛進，達到其收縮銀根與法幣回龍的目的。</p>
<p>自庫券上市以來，其銷額聞頗有起色。如二十三日一日之間，即達一一七，四九二億，爲數不可謂不鉅。但遊資太多，消納不易，近日物價飛漲，尤其是昨日之漲風，顯越常軌，巳非通常所稱收縮銀根的辦法所能奏效。當局雖已把發行地點，推廣到南京，天津，漢口，廣州和重慶五大都市，把發行機關，從國行推廣到證交，更想把甲乙兩種期限，推廣到等於遞交的丙種，而單靠這種辦法，能否把銀根切實收緊，把物價切實壓平下來，似乎仍是疑問。</p>
<p>發行庫劵，其目的原為收縮銀根，使一部份法幣回範，方針旣已確定，其竭力設法推廣銷路，自屬應有的措施，在這物價奔　，無法遏抑的時候，我們也同樣寄以深切的期望，不過從前所以未能暢銷的原因，如果依然存在，則改做遞交後所引起的刺激，其力量究有幾何，實未便過於高估。而且對付通貨膨脹，對付遊　作崇，與對付物價波動的價正效果，倒遝不在庫券推銷上所表現的數字之大小，而在這項策略究竟能否收效。因此之故，一面推銷庫劵，一面仍須停止膨脹，然後預期的效果可望實現。否則多發一張庫券，無非爲國庫暫時增加一分收入，其作用仍是限於財政的而不是金融的；而且以利息相當高，其到期後換發的新庫券，勢必農期增加。國庫負担增加，到最後來仍不得不取給於發行，從而通貨將愈膨脹，遊資將愈充斥，而物價也恐益發不可收拾了！</p>
<p>五月底的發行情形，王財長曾發表過一個總數，就是一百卅五萬億，比三月底的數字七十萬億，兩個月間，約增加了一倍。這可證明，現在通貨膨脹，依舊在急劇進展之中。這種惡劣的趨勢，如不能迅予遏阻，縱使丙種庫券發行順利，在證交市塲上可以收回小部份遊資，其於一般物價，一般經濟，又有何補？何况左手進來，右手又放出去，而東北，華北，華中，華西的遊資，又四方八面，紛紛集中到上海來，這正如某金融權威所說，洪流汜濫，斷非築堤防永所能奏效。何况單就丙種庫券的上市而諭，其效力恐也還比不上所謂築堤，自然更談不到防水。所以我們以爲收縮銀根，應當懲前瑟後，務從大處落墨。如市參議員徐永祚等主張組織發行監查委員會，制止通貨膨脹，似不失爲根本補救的一法。倘不此之圖，而一味枝枝節節，如所傳開做丙種庫券，疎導遊資南來，暫時拋售物資等等，無非是頭痛醫頭的自慰辦法，依照過去的成績　來，對於收縮銀根，法幣回籠，究有多大貢獻呢？</p>

<h3>財閥在日本</h3>
<p>— 吳嘉棠</p>
<p>已成不名譽的名詞</p>
<p>財閥在今日的日本，已是一個不名譽的名辭。如果和一個日本人開玩笑，不妨宣稱他是一個財閥，其影響之迅速，猶如稱呼他爲舊軍閥一樣。</p>
<p>日本財閥·如三井·三菱·住友等，過去與日本的侵略勢力結成一體，推動侵路政策，蹂躪整個東亞，因此，日本投降以後，財閥即與日本的軍備和戰爭潛能同在削除之列，因爲盟總知道倘財閥仍允其存在，日本將再度走上侵略之舊途，同時，從政治經濟的角度看，財閥是代表財富和其潛勢力的集中，日本人民今日本已左傾，財富分配不均，時時可引起一個大的爆發，而使日共在混亂中乘機崛起。</p>
<p>盟總處理財閥問題，似側重一種有系統的解散辦法。當然，最主要的出發點是儘早解散道批大財富集團，但是在這個目標之外，有另外幾方面必須鄭重的考慮，首先是解散工作必須亦勇亦愼的執行，免得引起整個經濟的混亂，而使共黨勢力乘虛而入。因爲今日在盟總佔領下的日本雖表面上看不出財閥過去主宰日本的一切，但是以往他們勢力深入，確是控制了每一個日本人的經濟命運。因此，盟總在對付道個有關日本全部國民經濟的大問題，不得不審愼措置，雖有」般人主張以快刀斬亂蔴的手段掃除現存制度，但爲免造成經濟上的瘓癱，又不能不步步爲營，作有計劃的推動。</p>
<p>外界有人指責盟總解散財閥的進度不够迅速，但是要知道，盟總執行工作時，受有遠東委員會的節制。除了剷除日本的軍備和戰爭潛能之外，遠東委員會並指示盟總執行一個基本的決策這個指示是：（一）協助日本人民在一個民主化的社會中，發展與他國間的經濟關係和文化關係，以滿足他們個人國家的合理需要，並使他們與其他國家永遠和平相處。（二）準許日本保持其謀生的工業，並以此價付合乎正義的實物賠償，但能使她重新武裝的工業不包括在內。爲了道個目的，可允許日本取得原料。將來日本一旦參加　界貿易關係，亦可獲得允許。根據這個意思，盟總在前年入月通過了一個控股公司（Holding　Compnay）淸理法案，同時成立了一個控股公司淸理委員會來淸理各大控制公司。　第一年內的工作，是把四十一家控股公司和一千二百家第一綫的子公司的內情，詳加調查，並指定其爲「受限制」的公司。這是表示這些公司的股東，不能隨意退出，而將股份讓給他人，以隱匿其所有權。此外，尚有二千多個「控制組合」和公會亦經嚴查，並指令日本政府解散所有的這些工業組合，和廢除一切扶育牠們的法律和條例。日本的控制組合，和我國的同業公會性質相近。他們在本身的一業內，議定價目，分配原料，決定統一的工資，限定不同工業的生產量並劃分各業的市塲。在前年年底，有六十三家公司被淸理，去年又有二十家被淸理。這些公司裏，包括三井，三菱和其他有名財閥的產業。同時，在分散法之下，在工業方面有三百二十五家公司，過去牠們的活動涉及日本人民生活的每一方面，現在亦將解散。裏而有一百四十四家公司，將被迫脫離牠們所有的子公司。</p>
<p>現有的統計資料，可說明這些被指定的控制公司，共擁有十五億另八百萬股，價值是六十三億日圓。控股公司淸理委員會全部接收了這批資產，並保管了這些公司及其子公司的大批股票，淸理這批公司，須深入研究其財務和結構，是一件長期而吃力的偵察工作。同時，盟總並採取步驟，以防止這些大公司重起而控制日本經濟。反托辣斯立法於佔領的第二年提出，而於去年七月十四日成爲法律。它禁止托辣斯，組合，和卡特爾，並成立公道貿易委員會，以實行這條法案的內涵。同時規定在一家新公司裏，舊工業組合職員參加時，不得超過一百人。而其子公司的指導者組織新公司時，亦以一人爲限。當然，盟總解散日本財閥勢力的工作，今後並不是輕而易舉的事，目前他們尚在設法出售由淸理委員會所接收的股票，要改變日本的全部經濟體制，還需要時間，忍耐，堅定和智慧。</p>

<p>〔路透社倫敦廿四日電〕共產國際情報局之全體大會，可望於華沙人國外長會議後緊接舉行。巴黎法共官方人土謂，共產情報局會議將於華沙會議後舉行，但未說明開會地點是否亦華沙。據克官方通訊社稱歷史必可顯示華沙會議係斯拉夫國家努力和平的表示。該通訊社並謂，捷克外長克里曼蒂斯在會中已有具體建議提出。</p>
<h3>西德三佔領區　軍政府將改組</h3>
<p>〔合衆社柏林廿五日電〕德境美軍事總司令克萊中將廿五日組織委員會，以三國爲基礎，改組軍政府。按英法司令已委定同一性質之委員會。</p>
<h3>四強展開冷戰　柏林局勢緊張　蘇宣布共管制已告終止</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕倫敦廿五日廣播：蘇方今開始正式行動，企圖迫使西方盟國退出柏林。柏林蘇聯區已奉令不得以食糧配給西區居民，英法兩國以迅速辦法應付，亦下令禁止以食物輸給蘇聯區。</p>
<p>〔合衆社柏林廿五日電〕蘇聯之「冷戰」策略，廿五日又發生迷人之向後轉。罕姆許送特鎭之盟方官負宣佈，馬倫堡地方蘇軍司令稱自西開往柏林之貨車，自廿八日起可恢復行駛，若然則柏林西區二百五十萬德居民不致挨餓，而蘇聯亦放　逐盟方出柏林之政策矣。故在表面上觀察·蘇可最後舉動，將再度鬆弛柏林危機。</p>
<p>〔合衆社柏林廿五日電〕德境蘇軍總司令索柯洛夫斯基今日宣佈柏林之四旨統治已吿終止。西方盟國遲早被逐出柏林之可能性，亦第一次有端倪可見。蘇聯及西方盟國展開柏林外交經濟戰時，美英法佔區之二百五十萬德人，正處於兩大勢力之問而蒙池魚之殃。負責人士詳盡研究美軍總司令克萊廿四日所　「以吾人而言，除非以兵戎相見，休想將吾人逐出柏林」。彼等指出「以吾人而言」及「德人亦　其災」兩語表示有放棄柏林之可能，一高級人士感覺，如盟軍續駐柏林而使其區內德人飢餓選難，則西方國家可能退出柏林。</p>
<p>〔路透社柏林廿五日電〕柏林之冷戰已因四强之若干行動及反行動而愈趨緊張。美國方面發言人亦謂蘇聯之下令實施幣制改革，爲蘇聯區布爾　維克化之最後階段。柏林英美區之居民於今晨起開始掉換新馬克，使柏林市之分裂成爲旣成事實。位於蘇聯區內之柏林中央糧食局奉蘇當局之令，已不再以蘇聯區供給之糧食發給西區，前此係由四佔領國當局各供給一定量之糧食，交中該局分配全市，英軍總司令羅勃森與美軍總司令克　昨夜曾舉行長談，商量對蘇聯之切斷對柏林西區之電力供應及對鎖柏林對西德之鐵路交通採取反措施。</p>

<h3>除非兵戎相見　英決不退出柏林　貝文外相在下院表示</h3>
<p>〔路透社倫敦廿五日電〕貝文外相今日宣布，英國對於柏林危機與美法採取一致立塲，鄭重表示唯有戰爭始能將西方强國逐出柏林。貝文在下院答覆關於柏林危樣之質詢時聲稱，危險的局勢已在柏林發生，該處之示威顯然在迫使西方盟國退出柏林，幸該地英當局持之鎭定，令人欣屬。</p>
<p>吾人係本於權利而在柏林，蘇聯有　力而爲的能力，但亦深知必須造成衝突的局勢，始能迫我退出柏林。然吾人決不退出柏林，縱於被迫退出之後，仍將重返柏林。西方强國已通知蘇方，願在四强共管的原則下，使蘇聯區之新幣在柏林普遍流通，然蘇方堅持此事祗能由蘇當局單獨控制。吾人苟予接受，不啻放棄在柏林之權利，英國決不同意發行數額之決定權操諸他人之手之新幣制。蘇聯之態度迫使西方强國捨進行其自己的計劃以外，無其他途徑可循。貝文繼否認蘇方已在柏林之空中走廊設置阻隔汽球，渠亦不信局勢將永遠如目前之令人不安。渠透露英美法三强在柏林獲有普遍的協定，就迅速發展的局勢保持經常接觸。某保守黨議員詢問英美至何種程度將考慮使用武力時，貝文表示除渠已發表之談話外，不擬另有表示。</p>
<h3>美譴責蘇聯　違反現行協定</h3>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓廿四日電〕國務院今日發表聲明，指責柏林方面蘇軍當局　　西區電流，並對鎖糧食運輸，實屬違反現行協定</p>
<h3>法態度堅決</h3>
<p>〔路透社巴黎廿四日電〕法外部發言人稱，法國具有繼續留在柏林之堅決意志，不因目前之冷戰而有變更。吾人可以實施報復，吾人可以切斷對柏林蘇聯區之自來水及煤氣供應，其切斷之數量更可在蘇聯切斷對西區供應量之上。</p>
<h3>杜魯門簽署　徵兵法及軍費案</h3>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓廿四日電〕杜魯門總統今日簽署美國承平時歡兵法案，使成法律。預料第一年內將有二十萬至廿五萬人被繳入伍。此外又簽署財政下年度內之壽軍經費案，總計三十七億四千九百萬元，陸空軍經費案共六十七倍餘元。</p>

<h3>遠東委會通過決議　淮各國調查日工業</h3>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓廿四日電〕遠東委員會今夜舉行秘密會議，通過澳洲提議，准許各國派遺代表調查日本工業之拔兩進步情形，美國曾一度表示反對。此種決定實際　　戰後外國調查日本工業，發明與製造之門戶，大抵同時包括調查武器與彈獎之權利。日本之紡織機器與嚴新式漁綱最受　意。遠東委員會即將以決議案訓令麥帥迅速照辦。</p>

<h3>美共和黨總統候選人　杜威略歷</h3>
<p>— 本報資料室</p>
<p>美國共和黨總統候選人，一致　定杜威，他已是第三次競選總統了。一九四〇年，有人試圖提名杜威爲總統候選人，但共和黨大會中却決定了威爾基，這是他初次的失敗。一九四四年，杜威被提名爲共和黨總統候選人，在選舉中又失敗。杜威雖經兩次失敗，却有再接再厲的精神，作第三次總統的競選。</p>
<p>杜威於一九〇二年生於密歇根州之奧俄沙。一九二三年畢業於密歇根大學後，轉入哥倫比亞大學研究法律，於一九二五年畢業，曾赴歐洲遊歷，返國後執行律師業務，一九三一年起，担任紐約某區的檢察官。一九三五年，被任爲特別檢察官，從事於驅逐紐約市中的流氓，與惡勢力環境相搏門，頗著聲譽。一九三七年，當選為郡檢察官。翌年，被共和黨提名爲紐約州長候選人，結果未能當選。一九四二年，當選為紐約州州長，一九四六年紐約州長選舉，杜威再度當選。</p>
<p>杜威住在紐約州波林農莊上，有一個美滿的家庭，一位太太，兩個孩子。他在紐約州長任上，充分表現他的幹才。他曾籌集了六萬兩千三百萬的戰後復興費用，减去百分之四十的所得稅，力爭退伍軍人的退職金，安排退伍軍人的住所及教育，改正紐約州公共衛生方案，提高公敎人員之待遇，推行禁止公務員罷工法案等等，表現他很好的政績。</p>
<p>杜威的政治主張；目前生活費的高漲，是通貨膨脹所致，同時刺激工業的增產。他主張减少政府開支，制止投機，鼓勵儲蓄，使經濟納於正軌。在外交方面：他希望龍建立一個强大的自由國家的世界，所以應該竭力援助歐洲的復興，推動歐洲成爲一個自由國家的大聯邦，作爲持久和平的屏障，來擊破野心家所鼓動的戰爭危機</p>
<p>對中國，杜威是主張緊念援華渚。去年一年中，杜威曾在數度的公開演說中，都有充分的說明。他認爲中國目前的處境，十分嚴重，若失去整個中國，則亞洲和西歐全部將隨之失落，美國形成了孤立。所以美國必須儘速援助中國，解除中國目前的困境，才是唯一對美國有利的途徑。</p>

<h3>市府召開緊急會議　商討抑平物價對策　經警今起普查倉庫物資　俞警局長對撤銷經警問題發表談話</h3>
<p>本市參議會潘議長公展，以本市通日物價暴漲，昨日漲勢尤劇，平民生活感受嚴重威脅，而政府迄未採取有效辦法，以謀遏止，特建議吳市長召集本市各有關機關首長，舉行會議，商討抑平物價對策，此項建議，業經吳市長同意，決於今日下午二時，在市府召集緊急會議，潘議長，方主委，警備部宣司令，社會局吳局長，警察局兪局長等均將應邀出席。討論結果，將提出今日參議會大會報吿。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕市警局兪叔平局長對撤銷經濟警察大隊一事，昨向記者宣稱：在未奉市府命令之前，決仍照舊負責監視各業市塲，抑且將更予加强工作，並定今日起檢查全市各倉庫物資，嚴厲取締囤積居奇，以期對昨日縣起之物價漲風予以無情之打擊。</p>
<p>俞局長昨並對經警隊及延長宵禁時間問題，發表書面談話如下：「（一）本局經濟警察隊未能辦到理想境地，本人表示十分遺憾，不過以往經濟警察對於物價直綫上漲之壓抑，及予奸商市僧之打擊，自亦不無微勞，本局經濟警察之成立，係根據卅五年四月十五日修正公佈之本局組織規程第六條第九款關於經濟管制法令之執行事項之規定而開始執行職務，並於卅六年九月卅日呈奉市府核准成立，經濟　察大隊，於三十六年十一月內政部警察總署為配合動員戡亂綱領復頒第一九六七六號代電，訂定戡亂時期警察中心工作實施方案，依據該方案確保地方洽安掌第五項問置經濟警察第一款之規定，首都暨院轄市警察局，各依情况需要，設立經濟科或經濟警察大隊，並於卅七年秘亥〇一〇一二八號代電飭切實辦理有案，故經濟警察之法令依據，實無可懷疑之處。至其撤銷問題，如確為眞正民意所歸，諒上級機關必允予考慮。但今後即予取銷，而在此戡亂時期，制裁投機奸商之經濟管制法令，中央決不致於廢止，且欲使此種法令切實有效起見，仍非設强有力之執行機構不可，本局職掌治安雖有協助推行經濟管制洗令之任務，而究非經濟主管機關，且平時責重事繁，維持一般治安已感不勝負荷之苦，如今後經濟管制主管機關能負責直接執行，本局仍處協助地位，自所切盼。</p>
<h3>娛樂塲所　不宜延長時間</h3>
<p>（二）關於參議會警政小組決議延長宵禁時間問題，恐原議案文字上稍有錯誤，因本市目前根本無宵禁之規定，而參議員所提出者實為特種營業如舞廳戲院酒菜館俱樂部等公共娛樂塲所營業時間之延長，此項決議理由如何，未便遑揣，不過際此動員戡亂時期，中央一再命令節約，而同時在此奸匪到處流竄，社會動盪不定之際，延長娛樂塲所營業時間，絕非所宜，深望參議員諸公本權能分治之原則，及俯念當前嚴重之局勢，予本局為大衆利益及地方治安設想之此種措施，再予以鄭重之考慮與協助。」</p>
<h3>宣司令論時弊　力主澈底革新　經濟病根在不均　政治應爭取羣衆</h3>
<p>淞滬警備司令宣鐵吾，於廿五日下午四時對記者發表談話，痛論時弊，力主澈底革新。宣氏率直指出，經濟政治之危機日趨嚴重，軍事則與政治經濟脫節，若不迅謀改善，再事拖延，後患不堪設想。宣氏先論物價問題謂：挽救經濟危機之道，非正本淸源不可，自前以有限之經濟檢察人員從事金鈔黑市與囤積居奇之檢查，自難獲致預期成效，故必須由中央與地方政府與人民，共同澈底檢討目前經濟病態之癥結所在，然後決定正本淸源之對策，目前之經濟病態，一言以蔽之為「不均」，社會財富日趨集中，少數人窮奢極侈，多數人不得一飽，如此現象，經濟戡亂，何從談起。故欲謀經濟之革新，一「均」宇而已。</p>
<h3>組訓民衆　保障土劣　殆不可能</h3>
<p>宣氏論及政治方面，檢討共匪之策略，是黨，政，軍，經濟，敎育文化澈底打成一片，做到眞正之總體戰，然在我方，則組訓民衆發展自衛隊之工作，收效不大，主因在於「缺少一個足够的政治意義」。一般人民在縱續受到食官汚吏，土豪劣紳，不斷剝削之情形下，使彼等組訓起來以保障貪官汚吏與土豪劣紳之利益，殆屬不可能，蓋彼等均知若共匪到來，淸算鬥爭之對象，決非彼等也。是故「爭取羣衆，收拾人心」，為革新政治急要措施。宣氏謂：軍事不能脫離政治經濟而孤立，軍事必須以淸明之政治，穩定之經濟作基礎，才能堅强起來，達到克敵制勝的任務。</p>
<h3>應即實施　總體戰</h3>
<p>宜氏答覆淞滬警備區之治安情形謂：現正加派海軍巡邏，沿海則加强戒備，決無問題。渠並透露長江以南諸省，可能提早實施總體戰方案，惟據料為時最早當尙在歡月以後。渠稱：吾人應坦白承認長江以北諸省之所以造成今日之局面，實由於實施總體戰方案過遲之故，今長江以南諸省，必須接受北方諸省之敎訓，立刻實施總體戰，從事軍事政治經濟密切配合之指施，以求軍事上做到肅淸潛匪，政治上做到澈底革新作風，組訓民衆，經濟上先做到穩定，再求新制度的確立，保障人民最低限度的生活，如此長江以南可成「金城湯池」，而長江以北剿匪軍事之開展，亦指日可待。</p>
<h3>五機關首長否認　軍友社理事名義</h3>
<p>淞滬警備司令宣鐵吾，昨下午四時，接見記者，否認曾担任軍之友社理事之名義。會同辦理劉案之上海師管區司令傳正模，吳淞要塞司令邵百昌，上海港口司令周力行，聯動總部上海供應局長陳謙亦作同樣之表示。</p>
<h3>限價電影　改為十萬　其他座價不變</h3>

<h3>出租汽車公會　要求自行議價</h3>

<p>又悉：中信局副局長沈熙瑞與沈祖同已提出辭呈，且去意甚堅，繼任人員聞已內定為中央合作金庫副總經理兼上海分庫經理駱美中，及財政部參事賀其　，將於今日理事會中討論。</p>
<h3>國大代表朱鳳蔚等　籲請役政改徵為募</h3>
<p>國大代表朱鳳蔚，李熙謀，褚鳳章等，以兵役役政不良，徵兵志願兵並行制度，造成不肖兵役人員，勾結兵販子，由鄕保派款買丁，每一代替役兵，需白米卅石至四五十石，而所徵之兵，俱為無業游民，不堪應戰，入伍即逃，重行換姓改名應徵，民不堪命，農村破產，應請改徵為募，以保國脈，而安民心。</p>

<h3>販賣銀幣銅幣　不應沒收</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕司法行政部近以銀幣交易及買賣之風日盛，各地經營販賣者益多，因而觸犯刑章者亦夥。本市地檢處昨接該部訓令，略以「各地私運販賣銀幣或銅幣者，尙不成立犯罪，其銀幣或銅幣，不應沒收，而意存販賣，尙未曾兌換法幣者，自亦應認為不成立之犯罪。」</p>
<h3>舞廳業全體樂師　向資方要求加薪</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕本市舞廳業全體樂師，近聯合向舞匯業次方要求增加工資百分之百。渠等所持理由為：西籍樂師目前平均月薪雖有八千萬元左右，但因家屬遠在菲列賓，如折成美金匯回接濟家用，為數甚微，不敷維持生活。至　籥樂師目前平均月　約五千萬元，亦因生活高漲，故向無冷氣設備之舞應要求按月照生活指數加薪，對有冷氣　備之舞　，則要求增加百分之百。此事業由社會局居間謂解。</p>
<h3>油荒暫獲解決　各站今起儘量供應　加油仍須按照規定</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕本市嚴重之汽油荒，連日經吳市長多方奔走設法，於二十三日舉行緊急會議後，昨日復與輸出入管理委員會，中央銀行分別接洽，使各油公司於當日順利辦妥四十萬介侖汽油之結滙手續，故今日起各加油站即能儘量供應。</p>
<p>據汽油分配委員會表示：車輛加油仍須按照加油辦法辦理：（一）每三天祗准加油一次，小客車每次加油至多以十介侖為限，貨車每次加油至多以廿介侖為限，機器脚踏車每次加油至多以二介侖為限。（二）凡已購足規定配油量之汽車，加油站不予供應。（三）凡在修理及不能行駛之汽車，不得拖往加油站加油。市政府特指定公用局與警察局嚴格執行上項辦法，並將出動大批稽查人員至各加油站視察加油情形，如發覺有不照規定辦法加油者，即予吊銷其購油證，永不發給。</p>
<h3>避免搶購重演　研究有效對策</h3>
<p>據悉：本市當局已向中央申請增加本市汽油配額，或重新分配全國各地汽油額，使更合理，若總配額不能增加，則本市汽車配油量勢必核减，至於核减辦法亦請中央指示。為避免搶購恐慌重演，當局正研究有效對策：（一）請中央銀行准予本市每月汽油一次結滙，如此項辦法得中央核准，則每月汽油之售價可不致前時調整。（二）以車主職業或地　硬性規定加油站頭，疏散主要加油站之擁擠。（此辦法困難殊多，難於實行。）</p>

<h3>參議大會收到　緊急動議兩起　廢除花紗布管制政策爭取外匯　請中央交涉停止香港申匯交易</h3>

<h3>六月漲風愈演愈烈　本市物價空前狂跳　一般日用品平均較上日高二成</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕昨日本市物價空前狂漲，爲勢之猛烈，前所宋有。白粳出一千六百萬關，生油達五千一百萬，棉紗廿一支雙馬達六億九千萬。金鈔黑市上漲最烈，平均咸比較昨日高數成。永紗漲停板，一般日用品平均漲二成，商家均忙於更改標價。市民以六月漲風，愈演愈烈，心理上均成恐慌。至於昨日物價全面狂漲之影響，據熟悉市塲之人士分析，除游資繼續南來及銀根鬆動外，時局之影響亦有重大關係；市面謠言甚多，對物價極有刺激作用。</p>
<h3>米價扶搖直上　白粳見一千六百萬元高價</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕米價昨在百物狂漲聲中，扶搖直上，如脫韁野馬，已無法控制。民調會之每隔一日拋米六千石，如杯水車薪，無濟於事。糧食當局因拋米已失却效用，將考慮其他方法。</p>
<p>昨日南北兩米市塲，謠言甚熾，大戶執貨，堅不脫手。無錫產地糧價報漲，消息傳來，人心頓受刺激，各檔米價，均趨猛漲，一致上升一百萬至一百五十萬元左右。</p>
<p>茲將昨日米價探錄於後：北市塲，白粳一千六百萬元，薄稻一千五百七十萬元，早稻一千五百萬元。南市塲，白粳一千五百萬元，薄稻一千五百三十萬元，早稻一千五百萬元，特粳一千五百五十萬元，昨到米三千八百三十七石。</p>
<h3>粉糧油市狂漲</h3>
<p>麺粉價格由於米價及其他物價之一致狂竄，益以銀根突鬆，人心異常奮振，價格扶搖直上。老車由四百七十萬開後，升至四百九十萬元。兵船四百八十五萬收市，谷挺五十萬元。紅蜂·建成·及雜牌粉，一致扯升五六十萬元。麩皮迫近四百萬，升三十五萬，小麥廠盤加五十萬。</p>
<p>雜糧市塲一片漲風，普遍猛升一成至二成餘。乍豆初升六七十萬，後餅油俱暴升，遂吿無人售出，最後乍豆已漲達八百五十萬。車豆九百萬，各升一百五十萬之鉅。苞米·元麥·北帮納多，各升一百萬。茶豆·蠶豆·漲七八十萬至一百萬元。僅莞豆新貨到多，客銷尙呆，故獨平穩。芝蔴漲二百多萬，生仁挺六百至七百萬。</p>
<p>食油漲勢如虎生翼，豆油狂漲二成以上，開漲價以來之新紀錄。豆油初開三千三百五十萬，在散戶爭購下，最後達三千七百五十萬高價，狂跳八百五十萬元。生油漲一千萬，吉桶生油五千一百萬乏出戶，生菜油等一致狂漲，豆餅登四百萬高價，升七十萬。</p>
<h3>結匯證明書　售價又上漲</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕結匯證明書售價昨日又創紀錄，晨開價一百二十萬元，尙無人肯售出，市價再漲，至一百二十四萬時始有成交。結匯證明書昨日之最高售價爲一百三十五萬，但以此價格成交者極少。大部份之交易均在一二四萬及一二五萬時成交，中國銀行一家即售出三十萬美金。在售價一百三十萬時，亦成交五千美元。</p>
<h3>中信局收購水蛋　前後已有十五批</h3>
<p>共計一一〇七〇噸</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕中信局收購冰蛋，前後十五批，共計一一〇七〇噸。過去已裝出四批，共計四九〇八噸，第五批一三〇九噸及第六批七七九噸，下週內即可啓蓮赴英。冰蛋依國內市價計算，包括運費在內，每噸約七億六千五百萬元，以英國價格二百十鎊計算，可達八億以上，故冰蛋出口，並不虧蝕。</p>
<h3>游資湧入市塲　華股什九漲停板　公債趨昂外股買氣蓬勃</h3>
<p>華股昨以圈外之刺激異常嚴重，且有無貨可扒之勢，游資退而求其次，永紗終吿漲停，并有貼價，餘股除大通外全部漲停。</p>
<p>晨開時人心奇俏，永紗以四五二〇元之價登塲，先後被賣到四五〇〇元，及四六二〇元。業外刺激步强，但代辦費開高爲五五元及六〇元，且須兩天負担，雖升而多回，經數度拉鋸，終以實貨漲勢銳厲，港電報縮至一角半，漲到四七四〇元新高峯。布市瘋狂，遭停市處分，紗布高後有回，乃跌至四六三〇元。但五和恒豐屹立漲限，人心仍見興奮，廣帮等仍納，午收四七〇〇元。除五和漲停，火柴恒豐漲停後有回，國貨小升外，餘均漲半成至一成不等。</p>
<p>後市業外之刺激加重，逐級上漲，迨臨收時各股除大通外全部漲停。永紗暗市且加七八十元，較晨收計大通升一成外，餘均漲停板。塲外各未上市股票一致漲起半成左右。</p>
<p>公債昨亦趨昂，統丙自晨開升為五七萬後，自五五萬低價起盤升至六三萬五而後稍回，較前收計甲乙升四萬元，丙昻十萬元，丁升三萬元，戊種亦好五萬元成交約三百餘萬。</p>
<p>外股昨以金融性物資之暴騰，且有無貨應市之象，游資兼程湧來，洋行帮證券帮廣帮均進，怡紗自晨開一〇〇〇萬起，漲到一二〇〇元高峯，而後稍平。較前收計各熱門股一致　起三成至四成不好。</p>
<h3>棉紗棧單　限期迅速出貨</h3>
<p>否則報請政府作價收購</p>
<p>邇來棉紗飛漲，塲中投機氣氛濃厚，今（廿五）日各紗開盤後繼續猛漲，漫無止境。紗管會有鑒及此，特現定辦法三項如下：</p>
<p>（一）近查有三十餘家紗商，勾結居間人，在市以廿一支雙馬套利，投機操縱，高抬紗價，政府當局，已在澈查，從嚴處置中。今後居間人對賣買雙方店號，地址，負責人姓名等，遇有監察人員詢問時，應當時說明，不得含混，否則以投機抬價檢舉嚴辦。</p>
<p>（二）居間人照例呈繳之成交棧單，不得缺少，均須加塡賣買雙方地址，並純公會蓋章，如有違背陳報，除取消居間人資格外，並依法究辦。</p>
<p>（三）近查各紗廠棧單，久在市塲週轉，助長投機，統限迅速出貨，否則報請由政府作價收購，或依照非常時期取締日用必需品囤積辦法懲辦。</p>
<h3>行局差進一萬餘億　銀根仍見平穩</h3>
<p>〔華東社〕昨日銀錢業票據交換四行一局差進一一二〇七億，銀根平穩。行局個別差額計央行進五五四一億，中國出二三三九億，交通進五四四八億，農民進九〇一億，中信局進三三一四億，郵匯局出一八九二億，合作金庫進二三四億。大交換出二二九七億，小交換出一四六〇〇億，外商銀行進五六九〇億。</p>
<h3>絲綢飛昂</h3>
<p>人造絲昨市益形瘋狂，一二〇號金三馬有光，上午開盤即高至九億五千萬元，繼升至十億〇五千萬元，一度降跌一億元，午收又升至十億元。下午不斷上揚，開盤此上午收盤價大一億二千萬元，收盤再高至十二億元。</p>
<p>廠經昨市漲勢不若人絲之甚，因中信局配售本埠及外埠絲織廠共計三百担，價開九億五千二百萬元，九五折計算，下月七日期款，故最後市况略呈疲軟。上午高零担十億〇五千萬元有成交，下午做開十一億五千萬元，最後喊價十二億，Ｄ字等級最高價十三億元有交易。</p>
<p>綢貨昨市飛昻，華强眞絲被面，上午收市高至四億八千萬元，格子璧縐棧單做一百八十萬元，下午更形瘋狂，被面竟高叩六億元，格子璧縐棧單在二百萬元關外，其餘各貨，下午廠盤大都未曾開出。</p>
<h3>茶市初平後挺</h3>
<p>昨茶市續呈初平後挺之局，綠晨開一部份同業感於六底趨近，逼於頭寸，心思惴惴不安，形勢卒乏變化。而俄傾在百物空前狂漲中，故迫使人心向榮，執主頓起力抬，收市乃迭創高峯。而交易則除外銷茶因出口商問津尙可外，他若內銷花色，本街與鄕莊帮亦有垂詢，過程均見活潑。</p>
<h3>買戶不惜高價進取　紗市猛升布價暴漲　棉布市塲後市中止交易</h3>
<p>昨日棉紗市况，人心一致看好，見貨即購，大戶開路，散戶跟隨，塲內一片競買聲，供戶缺乏，市氣沸騰，喊價紊亂。</p>
<p>四十二支藍鳳細紗，開盤狂騰一億五千餘萬元，嗣以買戶不惜高價，一味濫進，市勢步升。最高曾叩九億大關，後因紗管會公佈，取締棧單套利交易，人心轉虛，一般浮多獲利吐售，行情卒以八億七千萬元結束，比上日步漲二億零五百萬元。其餘各支組細紗價，亦飛漲甚鉅。</p>
<p>昨日棉布市况，買戶蠭湧，市氣瘋狂，市盤飛揚。十二磅龍頭細布，初開即暴升三百七十萬元，嗣以新買戶活躍，同業吸納亦健，塲上買氣更濃，一霎間冲破二千萬大關，步昻至二千零五十七萬許，成交甚夥。迨至十點半左右，當局及花管會爲抑止漲風，在塲宣佈龍頭細布及四君子元嗶嘰，暫停交易，以待中紡開售，供應恢復正常後，再行交易。致後市交易中止，查各布行情較之上日飛升有二成至三四成之鉅</p>

<h3>留美自費生　反對結匯新辦法</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕自政府規定留學生改按牌價結匯之消息，到達美國後，在美之第二屆自費留學生，羣起恐慌，認爲若按牌價結匯，九百美元，即需法幣四五億元之鉅，自非學生所能負担。全國第二屆自費同學會主席趙一　，急電行政院敎育部，請求維持官價，以完學業，並赴華盛頓，向顧大使請願。密歇根大學校長魯思文博士（Dr.　Ruthven）及國際學生監督蓋樂博士（Dr.　Gale），對學生處境，均表同情，亦電我國財長王雲五，作同樣之表示。該校自費生六十餘人，已成立同學會，推選朱之泰，江祿煜爲負責人，積極聯絡他校同學，以策進行。自費生所持之理由：（一）教育部考取第二屆自費留學生，按一萬二千元結匯，曾由行政院函覆立法院，有案可據。（二）自費生出國時，曾由外交當局向美方交涉，保證自費生外匯無問題，美領事館始允以九百元簽證，此次變更外匯，不僅增加學生之負担，更使外交當局失信於美方。（三）新定價格較官價高出四十倍，自費生實無力籌集四五億元之鉅款。（四）政府再聲明留學期間爲兩年，自費生先後出國，有結匯三次者，有結匯一次者，驟予變更，殊欠公平。</p>

<h3>一枝花</h3>
<p>— 張政烺</p>
<p>唐元稹元氏長慶集卷第十，酬翰林白學士代書一百　：</p>
<p>翰墨題名盡，光陰聽話移。下有自註云：</p>
<p>樂天每與予游，從無不書名屋壁。又當於新昌宅說一枝花話，自寅至已猶未畢詞也。（按元氏長慶集明嘉靖東吳　氏刻本及萬蠶松江馬氏刻本皆缺此業，此註文不全。淸錢謙益盧文紹及近人張元濟皆嘗據宋本校補，故今見全唐詩及四部幾刋已照補不缺。）</p>
<p>按新昌里在長安延興門內路北，據徐松唐兩京城坊考（卷三），白居易爲主客司郞中知制誥時居新昌里。微之此詩追憶舊游緬懷往事，當是唐德宗貞元十八年（八〇二）微之以中書判第四等授校書郞以後，憲宗元和元年（八〇六）中才識兼茂明於體用科拜左拾遺以前，三四年間之事。（參考趙德麟侯鯖錄卷五，微之年譜）。「說話」爲宋代瓦舍技藝之一，其淵源可溯於隋代之侯白，余別有說。此處之所謂「一枝花」則當爲今日所知小說話本之最早者。</p>
<p>一枝花即　國夫人傳，今見最早之本爲太平廣記（卷四百八十四）所載，題「李娃傳」，篇尾註「出異聞集」。按異聞集卡卷，唐末屯田員外郞陳翰編，見新唐書藝文志子部小說家類。其書宋晁公武郡齋讀書志陳振孫直齋書錄解題皆著錄，以後失傳。國立中央研究院歷史語主研究所藏明抄本會慥類說眷第二十六上有異聞集，已刪節不完，前有銜名題「將仕郞尙書屯田員外郞陳翰編」，與唐志及書錄解題合，猶是原書款式。其湃國夫人傳節略太甚，視太平廣記所載不及十一，未有語云：</p>
<p>舊名一枝花。元稹酬白居易代書一百韻云，口（翰）墨題名盡，光陰聽話移柱（注）云，樂天從遊常題名於桂（壁），復本說一枝花，自寅及已，（按此文闕一翰字，註誤柱，壁誤桂。又「復本」二字當亦誤字，不敢臆定。）</p>
<p>此文當是陳翰異聞集原有之按語，曾慥爲類說旣刪節湃國夫人傳正文，亦刪節陳論附註之按語，故文字艱澀不甚貫通。調此按語出異聞集有一旁證，按同書謝小娥傳之末亦有按語云：</p>
<p>幽怪所載小異，故兩存之。</p>
<p>此處之謝小娥傳雖經刪節，以與太平廣記（卷四百九十一）李公佐謝小娥傳比較，可斷其原文爲李公佐之作。唐李復言續幽怪錄（四部叢刋續編影印宋本）有尼妙寂條，亦述小娥事而略有異同，陳翰「故兩存之。」今類說本異聞集只刪存李公佐文，若續幽怪錄所載則不存一字。是知此等按語皆出於陳翰而不出於曾慥也。太平廣記本李娃傳開端云：</p>
<p>湃國夫人李娃，長安之娼女也，節行環奇，長安稱者，故監察御史白行簡爲傳述。</p>
<p>此三十一字非白行簡原文，因此傳尾明記撰年爲貞元乙亥歲（十一年）秋八月，時行簡尙未第，（參考舊唐書本傳）何得自稱監察御史？故疑此亦陳翰異聞集之文，太平廣記編者刋除未盡竟竄居正文之首也。</p>
<p>陳翰唐末人，去元白時代未遠，謂湃國夫人傳舊名一枝花，當有所本。白行簡作傳在貞元十一年（七九五），元白於新昌宅聽說一枝花話則在其後七八年。傳文共三千五百餘字，面說話老自寅（上午三至五時）至已（上午九至十一時）猶未畢其詞，可見當時說話人之技術已甚進步，蓋敷演故事有多溢出傳文以外之辭也。宋代說話人往往運用　人小話爲話本，由此觀之，知此種風氣在唐人寫作小說時已然矣。</p>
<p>曾　類說書成於紹興六年（一一三六）刋於庚申（一一四〇）重刋於寳慶丙戍（一二二六）「明人刋本多所刪節，」（見鐵琴銅劍樓書目卷十六）其本皆不可見。文津閣四庫全書本卷第改易興中央研究院藏明抄本不同，異問集在第二十八卷，陳翰銜卷已不存，湃國夫人傳後按語僅存十二字：</p>
<p>舊名一枝花本說一枝花自演</p>
<p>文義愈不通順，疑非四庫館臣所刪改，惟果源出何本則不可知矣。</p>
<p>枝花初爲話本名稱，漸變爲李娃之表字。羅燁新編醉翁談錄癸集卷之一「不負心類」有「李亞　不負鄭元和」一篇，其起首數句云：</p>
<p>李娃，長安　女也，字亞仙，舊名一枝花。有漿陽鄭生字元和者，應舉之長安。……</p>
<p>羅燁醉翁談錄係日本伊達氏觀瀾閣所藏孤本，昭和十五年東京市文求堂影印行世，中日學者多定爲宋刻，以余觀之或係元刻明印之本，然其書成於宋末則無問題，此「舊名一枝花」五字顯然出自陳翰異聞集，疑原係標題下之小註，傳抄或刻板時竄入首行正文之中，故與上下文義不甚連貫。此種情形與前舉太平廣記本李娃傳首多出三十一字正復相似。（近爲友人校馬歡瀛涯勝覽，其每國標題下之小註亦常混入正文首行中，與此同例）。此後遂有謂李娃別名一枝花者，明周憲王李亞仙花酒曲江池（誦芬室董氏影印雜劇十段錦本）：</p>
<p>卜引正且梅香上云：老身是這長安城中鳴珂巷陌李媽媽的便是。有箇親生的女兒名是亞仙，城中官長每見他生的好，與了他箇名字叫做一枝花。……</p>
<p>此言李娃所以稱一枝花之故，在明以前人書中不能得其根據，當屬周憲王臆撰，故元人石君寳李亞仙花酒曲江池（元曲選乙集）及明人薛近袞繡繧記（涉園陶氏影印本）並無此說也。</p>
<p>李娃故事哀艷動人，而「曲終奏雅」與國人之倫理觀念相投，尤其流行之最大原因。唐人小說對於後世戲劇小說影嚮之大，元稹　鷥傳外，當推此篇，鶯鷥故事除金聖歎所謂「續西廂」者外，無大變化，李娃事在宋代即多異聞。元穗有李娃行，許彥周詩話嘗引其「　　峨峨高一尺，門前立地看春風」二句，全文已不可見。嘗見永榮大典郞字韻，有「遺策郞」條，引張君房麗情集載鄭生李娃事，惜僅寥寥數語，其詳亦不可得而言。憶北宋人筆記中已有提及「鄭元和」者，倉猝竟不能　其書名。故關於此故事之演化姑關不論。明晁環（嘉靖問人）寳文堂分類書目子部雜類有「李亞仙記」，雜厠於詞話小說之中，當即余公仁（崇禎間人）刋本黨居筆記第七卷「鄭元和嫖遇李亞仙認」之簡稱。此記是通俗小說體裁，謂鄭生名平字元和，其父名　字舉才，記之可以廣異聞。結尾云：</p>
<p>雖是靑樓新話編入谷幽生春</p>
<p>又綴以七絕一首七律一首，純屬「說話」語氣，惟鄙俚不堪，本事旣多違誤，趣味亦極低劣，似流行於說話人之口者時間甚久，故漸失眞。因疑「說一枝花話」自唐至明雖漸變質，並未失傳。謹誌於此，用質高明（三七·六·一二）</p>
<h3>鄒漢勛　「五均論」辨惑</h3>
<p>— 周祖謨</p>
<p>如宗歡悉曇林記傳中天之音（見日本安然悉曇藏），稱此類爲喉聲；智廣悉曇字記傳南天之音（見本書），則稱之爲牙聲是也。廣韻末辯字五音法蓋揉合兩派之命名，故有喉聲，又有牙聲。至於以匣母之何字爲喉聲，又以匣母之行幸爲牙聲者，則由於悉曇超聲之第八音h爲喉部磨擦音，與曉匣二母相近，Panini曾謂此與k爲一類，故傳梵學者即以此與見溪同論矣。今以音理言之，梵文之k，k，Ptatigakhyas謂之爲舌根聲（jihvamuliya）是也，Panini以爲音發自喉（Kantha）者非也。梵文之h爲喉音，Panini歸爲kk一類非也（參看Whithey's　Sanskrit　Grarhmar）。而中華之昔，見溪即相當梵文之kk，曉厘有若梵文之h，故唐人字母以見溪爲牙音，曉厘爲喉中音（見敦煌掇瑣一〇〇）。今日所見論悉曇之書，如湼槃經悉曇章，悉曇字記，景祐天竺字源等，其五聲之命名，均爲牙齒舌喉脣五類，由此可知五聲之有牙喉兩類之名，實有所本，名目固因　悉藝，所舉之字例或不盡合乎悉曇也。鄒氏不明牙聲之意義，文不明牙喉二聲相合之故，是以所言皆憑虛懸想之辭，不可不辨也。</p>
<p>要之，鄒氏此書，立論雖繁，精義甚尠，比之江陳二家之書，誠非可及。以其足以迷惑將來，故揚榷而陳之，非敢詆訶前人也。」（續完）</p>
<h3>懷鉛隨録</h3>
<p>— 唐蘭</p>
<p>新郪虎符，舊藏上虞羅氏，錯金書，四行，文爲：</p>
<p>甲兵之符，右在王，左在新郎。凡與士，被甲用兵，五十人以上，必會王符乃敢行之。燔　事，雖母會符，行　。字作小篆，甚精。</p>
<p>王靜安先生曾作秦新郪虎符跋據魏肇蘇秦說魏王：「大王之國，南有許，鄢，昆陽，舞陽，新郪，」說陀到魏安　王時還是魏地，因爲新郪在無陽東，中間隔楚國的陳邑，而那時楚的國都花在陳，一直到秦昭王五十四年，楚都遷到鉅陽，始皇五年又遷壽春，新郪才有入秦的可能。所以他考定：</p>
<p>此符當爲秦幷天下前二三十年間物。</p>
<p>王先生的考證，大體是不錯的。不過我覺得新　入奏還要遲些，而且那時已不屬魏。因爲奏始皇本紀視：</p>
<p>十七年，內史騰攻韓，得韓王安，盡納其地，以某地爲郡，命曰潁川。</p>
<p>六國表在始皇十七年下說：</p>
<p>內史勝擊得韓王安，盡取其地，置潁川郡。新　在漢書地理志屬汝南郡，汝南郡是漢高祖新置的，本屬於秦代的潁川南陽二郡，新郪大權就是由潁川分過去的。此外，魏策所說的「許」，「鄢」，（地理志作『傿慶」），「昆陽」，「舞陽』四縣，都在潁川郡，可爲明證。那末，這些地方秦得之於韓，已經不是魏的土地了。</p>
<p>始皇十七年置潁川郡是西元前二三〇年，隔九年就幷兼天下而稱爲皇帝，（始皇二十六年，西元前二二一年），但是這裏還只稱王，可見還在未稱皇帝以前，（陽陵虎符就說「右在皇帝』），也就只能在這九年裏面，所以，我疑心就是置潁川郡的時候所做的。那末，我們可以更確切一些說，這個虎符就作於始皇十七年後，至遲也不過一兩年之差。</p>
<p>那時，李斯已經用事狠久，他是手創小篆的，無怪這符的篆法是這樣精美了。</p>
<h3>讀馬元材著秦史綱要</h3>
<p>— 季羨林</p>
<p>我自己對秦史可以說是毫無通解，聽說馬先生是研究秦史的專家，所以就把他的大著秦史綱要從圖書館裏借出來，預備仔細讀一讀。但我還沒讀到正文，只讚到他的自序的第二頁，就　到下面的話：</p>
<p>「抑予因之而有感矣！讀畫之道，眞不易言。予治秦史，其最基本之根據，即爲史記。史記者，乃幼而習之之書也。即以發心治秦史之年起計之，至今亦已十有二年。鏘研於史記之中者，何止百千萬遍。乃逾十年，至三十年秋，始識「禁不得祠」之「不得」，即爲「浮屠」。又逾二年，至本年春（民國三十三年—羨林註），始識「美門」即「沙門」，「安期」即「阿耆尼」。（均見本書下册及拙著秦時佛敎已流行中國考—作者原註）」</p>
<p>不必再看全書，只是這短短幾句話我覺得就有商榷的必要了。</p>
<p>馬先生所說的秦史大綱下册和秦時佛敎已流行中國考似乎選沒有出版，最少是我還沒有看到。我不知道內容怎樣；但只看上面自序裏的一段話也就可以看出來，「禁不得祠」的「不得」就是後來的「浮屠」這件事是他在民國三十年（一九四一年）秋纔發現的，而且看口氣還是獨創，並不是抄襲別人。這使我大吃一驚。遠在一九二七年日本學者藤　豐八就寫過一篇論文（東洋學報第十六卷第二號），主張「不得」就是梵文Buddha的音　。中外學者們對這篇文章的反應差不多一致，他們都認爲這學說不能成立。原文「禁不得　明星出西方」的「不得」是虛字，不是實字。湯錫予先生（用彤）在他的漢魏兩晋南北朝佛敎史上册貞七—八也討論過這問題，他也認爲這說法毫無根據。可是馬先生竟在藤田論文出版以後十四年，在他自已發心治秦史以後十年，又忽然發現了「不得」就是「浮屠」。在他的大著秦時佛敎已流行中國考裏，這也許就是主要諭　，我們除了吃驚以外，還有什麼可說呢</p>
<p>我們當然不能要求一個學者要讀盡世界上所有的書，這根本是不可能的；但在他研究範圍以內的書籍和論文，他總應該大體知道。尤其是像藤田這篇論文好多學者都討論過，一個自命研究秦史的學者似乎不應該不知道。即使我們再退一步說，倘若一位學者想寫一篇論文證明秦時佛敎已經流入中國，他無一論如何也應該看一看湯著漢魏兩晋南北朝佛敎史。但馬先生對這一切竟都茫然，我們除了吃驚以外，眞沒有別的可說了。</p>
<p>我們現在再談馬先生在「發心治秦史」以後十二年發現的兩個外來的假借字：「羨門」即是「沙門」，「安期」即是「阿耆尼」。我們從史記的記戲裏只能看出，「羨門」是一個住在虛無縹緲間的仙人。然而馬先生却說，這就是印度的和尙。按「沙門」的梵文原文是Sramana，巴利文Samana。唐慧琳一切經音義卷十八說：「沙門，梵語訛也。正梵音云室囉末拏。」（大正大藏經卷五十四頁四二〇上）據我們現在的研究，「沙門」並不「訛」，因爲它不是直接由梵文譯過來的，而是經過了一番媒介。在吐火羅文Ａ（焉耆語）裏，梵文Sramana變成Samam，在吐火羅文Ｂ（龜茲語）裏變成Samane。中文「沙門」就是從吐火羅文裏譯過來的。馬先生旣然主張「羨門」即是「沙門」，是不是知道「沙門」的來源還有這樣許多屈折，是不是能證明「羨門」也是經過了吐火羅文的媒介總譯成中文的？他最少也應該能證明「羨門」是從印度古代俗語（Prakrit）裏譯過來的，因爲梵文Sramana絕不會譯成「羨門」。我恐怕這些馬先生都作不到。然而他自己却認爲這已經毫無問題。在他的秦史裏他已經替「羨門」立了一個獨立的傳了。</p>
<p>至於「阿耆尼」，梵文原文是Agni，是火神，在印度古代非常受尊崇。梨俱吠陀裏有很多歌是讚詠火神的。中譯「阿書尼」與梵音相當；但「安期」却有了問題。據高本漢（Berithard　Karlgren）的構擬，（安）字的發音是：</p>

<p>馬先生能證明爲什麼梵文Agni到了中國變了音麼？除了這譯音方面的困難以外，我們也不明白，爲什麼印度的火神跑到中國來搖身一變成了仙人？我們也希望馬先生能解釋給我們聽。</p>
<p>我對馬先生大著自序裏那幾句話的批評就到這裏爲止。也許有人認爲我小題大做。馬光生只是寥寥數語，我却寫了一大篇。但我覺得馬先生的那寥寥數語却代表現在中國學術界一個很流行非常時髦又非常荒謬的一種風氣，我們應該起來糾正。有許多所謂學者對中亞古代語文毫無通解，却偏好來談對音。他們連最根本的常識都沒有，連最簡單的方法都不知道，他們有的只是極可憐的一點幻想，他們就用了這幻想來研究問趙。只要他們高興，他們可以把任何中國字同任何外國字拉在一起，說這個中國字就是這個外國字的音譯。他們彷彿是玩積木的小孩子，能够把外國字的字母一個個分開來，再一個個重新排起來，前後次序對他們根本不重要。這種作風讓我們年了眞是啼笑皆非。我們簡直可以說，這是學術的妖孽。最近有好多學者寫這樣的文章。在讀這些文章以前，我不相信，世界上會有這樣荒謬的東西、讀了以後，我纔知道，我究竟還是井底之蛙。南京一位老學者在這方面尤爲努力，他寫渦許多這樣的文章。最妙的是，他也有一篇文章說「不得」就是「浮屠」，登在「眞理」上（這是張苑峯先生吿訴我的），眞可謂無獨有偶了。</p>
<p>我寫了一大篇，並不是對馬先生有什麼不敬，我只是借題發揮，希望學者們在研究對音的時候要特別小心。馬先生的書也許還有有價値的地方，恕我是外行，在這裏只談他自序裏的那一段話，其餘就不談了。</p>

<h3>拜偶像</h3>
<p>— 錢文</p>
<p>佛敎的三寳是佛·法·僧。如果要考試大衆，來一次知識測驗，把這三個名詞放進去，恐怕做出正確答案的不會多。何謂佛？世俗祗說是佛菩薩。何謂菩薩？他們會答菩薩是神。問僧是做什麼的？大概認爲念經咒超度亡靈的佔多數。什麼是法？能够作答的必然極少。</p>
<p>基督敎禁拜偶像，因爲一神敎固然不許崇祀牛鬼蛇神那些像，就是他們的耶和華，也不是用一種什麼像來表現得出的；至於聖母像和十字架上的耶穌像，都是紀念物，其物又是一種藝術品。佛敎以像爲敎。佛像，菩薩像，羅漢像雖然頗多，不論是泥塑，木雕，刻石，筆書的，全是印度這一派聖哲的遺容。雖然未必眞，多少由信仰者加以意想來造作，如觀世音在我國日久變成女性，這些像顯出慈悲莊嚴，却是一致的。信仰者對着佛和菩薩的像，不知不覺中會「與之俱化」（印光說），其作用是美感。眞正識得佛法的決不致把「求神」和「拜佛」混爲一事。</p>
<p>以前有個高僧，拿木造的佛像當柴燒，問他做什麼，他說要燒出舍利，問者說木頭那里有舍利，他說旣然沒有，是一塊木頭罷了，燒之何害。以偶像爲神靈，以佛像爲有求必應的一種神，以古人的石像爲佛菩薩，這證明了國民知識程度之低，可驚可痛。</p>
<p>章太炎說，「佛典本不禮鬼神，其自宗乃以寂定智慧爲主，勝義眇論，思入無問，適居印度，故雜以怪迂之談，而非中土高材所留意。一高材不迷信神話，這不必論，可惜的是佛法入中國後，勝義眇論，知之者少，神話却特別流行，使得愚夫愚婦，除了神怪，別無信仰。這是一個敎育問題，敲碎石翁仲來塡路也不是根本辦法。信仰自由，但如何能使國民信所應當信呢？</p>
<p>人說今日佛敎衰微，我却以爲不然。袞微的是入寺燒香，求子求財的風俗，這可見信神怪的人已經域少，而高材者正在紛紛組織佛學會，研究學問。不過高材者好爲其他高材者設想，却不肯擔心到橫路叩拜偶像者之衆多。旣然有人從事於重編大藏經，何以至今沒有人編一本淺易的佛敎概覽，使得反對的和迷信的都能够認識佛法的眞相。梁武帝問達摩，說他造寺，寫經，度僧，不可勝紀，有何功德。達麼答以並無功德。達摩東來，即向皇帝施以警吿，打破其迷信。佛敎徒要宏法，要解除愚人對佛法的誤解，最好先將龍華古剎裏的文昌殿和財神殿推倒；不然，人將以爲這兩尊祐人升官發財的偶像就是佛，就是菩薩。</p>
<h3>最小的鳥</h3>
<p>— 毛毅</p>
<p>蜂鳥是鳥類中之最小者，牠們體重沒有超過十分之一唡的。但是，牠們的飛行速率却極高，雙翼一秒鐘能拍擊七十五次，每小時能飛行五十五哩。並且能够來回飛行一千哩路！牠們所以能有這種偉業，因爲牠們具有相當堅强的翼部肌肉和偉大的雄心。</p>
<p>蜂鳥的整個生活旋律是快速度的：擇偶快；交配快；下蛋快；就是築巢也伏，通常一天就可完工。蛋的大小如同豌豆，雛鳥破殼而出時，難得比人類的手指甲大，煞是有趣。</p>
<p>蜂鳥的古頭是一鳥世界」的獨一無二的奇構，由兩個管狀器官組成。牠們吃的花蜜如何昇入這兩個器官，却至今還爲人類所不解。除了花蜜之外，牠們也吃在花叢中覓食的和在飛行中捕獲的小昆虫。</p>
<p>在選擇花類這方面，蜂鳥是有技巧的植物學家。牠們以花冠成喇叭形的花類爲覓食的對象，因爲這類的花朶的花蜜深藏在內。蜜蜂在這衷根本無法與蜂鳥競爭，唯有一種長舌的蝴蝶才能深入這類花朶，但是，性子强烈的蜂鳥却能够輕易的把牠們的爭食者趕跑。</p>
<p>蜂鳥種類繁多，並且名稱漂亮，如：靑玉蜂，虹蜂，神仙蜂，翡翠蜂等。一共算起來，蜂鳥計有六百五十多種，美國加利福尼亞洲帕沙帝那地方人勞伯特·摩爾所搜集的蜂鳥標本最爲豐富，差不多有六百種，都是他親手搜集的。</p>
<p>蜂鳥的羽毛極其美麗，在陽光之下顏色竟能變幻。不過，並非是蜂鳥的羽毛有多種色素，而是牠們的小羽枝能够像金鋼鑽一像的折光。蜂鳥有「羽毛的三稜鏡」，牠們是活的虹，牠們利用陽光把自己裝飾得珠光寳氣。</p>
<h3>魯迅藏書</h3>
<p>— 念新</p>
<p>三閒書屋收藏圖書，範圍極爲廣博，並分上海及北平兩處。滬部余曾見之，自綫裝洋裝之「國藉一外，旁及東西洋文字，其中自以日文爲最夥，德文次之，俄文英文雖亦有搜羅，則多因其書中插岡精美之故，蓋魯迅於中西美術固極留心愛護，其北平所藏之「漢畫」，聞中頗多珍品，惜生前不及編彙整理也。商務印書館之「四部業刊」，亦三閒書屋「大部書」之一，因魯迅欲於晚年編一完整之「中國文學史」，購此以爲參稽資料，且聞已擬妥計劃。魯迅與友人通訊時，亦曾論及此事，並以不能在國內得一優良靜謐之環境爲苦。北平雖爲理想之地，然因某種條件之限制，亦足使魯氏爲之「裏足」，故終其身，此一爲文苑所企望之「中國文學史」，卒未成隻字。（目下論國內最詳備豐贍之「中國文學史」，似以北平樸社版鄭著者爲此中白眉，惜僅至明代而止，且已絕版。）而「四部叢刋」之若干函，亦猶未啓封也。</p>
<p>至關於三閒書屋詳細之藏書目錄，景宋女士或已加編錄？惟對外則未見披載，此亦爲有書　者所關心。惟前此文匯夜報曾排日刋登魯迅之「日記」，其中每得一書，必加筆錄，讀者或可由此以見三閒藏書之一臠也。</p>
<p>於此，復憶及淪陷時期，因生活費用之高漲，魯迅北平家屬，曾有　書之說，當時景宋女士曾在滬登報反對。文人心血所聚，一旦易主，自可嘆息，後未知此說果否實行，抑或因上海方面之「反對」而　其議矣。惟余讀魯氏「病後雜談之餘」（且介亭雜文二二〇葉），述及宋端儀之「立齋閒錄」一書時，有云：「這書我一直保存着，直到十多年前，因爲肚子餓得慌了，才和別的兩本明抄和一部明刻的「宮開秘典』去賣給以藏書家和學者出名的傅某，他使我跑了三四趟之後，才說一總給我八塊錢，我賭氣不賣，抱回來了，又藏在北平的寓裏；但久已沒有人照管，不知道現在究竟怎樣了。」然則魯迅在早年，亦曾欲以賣書而解決其「肚子餓」的問題者也。此處之所謂「傳某」，當屬江鄕傅沅叔（增湘），即以藏庵圖書題記著名者。顧此書初非魯迅自身所購置，而爲其先德所遺，蓋其文中曾有「我家並不是藏書家，我眞不解怎麼會有這明抄本」云云，其爲名貴可見。故余亦欲附筆一問：「不知道現在究竟怎樣了？」</p>

<p>有種人以爲凡是人家的全是好，又有種人則以爲凡屬於自己的才是第一。——全是一樣糊塗的可麟蟲。</p>
<p>一個大夫在診所裏咒駡病人，他忘了康健的人是不找醫生的麼？</p>
<p>假使你羨慕人家籃裏有魚，趕快將你自己的網撒下河底去。</p>
<p>世上有這許多鏡子，爲什麼還有這許多不知自己本來面目的人？</p>
<h3>強迫</h3>
<p>— 翼君</p>
<p>有時，「强迫」並不等於「壓迫」。受「壓迫」的人只有痛苦，而被「强迫」的人，却也許可得幸福。</p>
<p>譬如：夏季來臨，傷寒霍亂流行的時候，衛生當局便有强迫打防疫針的辦法，不管你願不願打，怕不怕痛，總要給你至少打上一針，否則，就要跟你爲難，例如不賣火車要給你。但是强迫你打針，乃是爲着你的幸福，並全體市民的幸福。</p>
<p>又如：各國都有强迫敎育的制度，（昨夜寫到這裘，是十二點鐘了，電燈總機關掉，宿舍燈熄，我被强迫上床睡覺，心裏頗有點抱怨。但是午夜十二時熄燈，强迫我拋筆睡覺，確是顧到了我的健康。）義務敎育的年限，中國爲四年，英國爲十年，美國爲四年至九年，蘇聯爲四年等等。不管你將來的志願怎樣，先受完規定年限的强迫敎育再說，不受不行。但是，强迫你受敎育，乃是爲了要給予你以精神的食糧，保存並發揚民族的文化。</p>
<p>像這類並非「壓迫」的「强迫」，爲了獲得「幸福」的「麻煩」，是不怕做得澈底的。可是，如果主其事者一味板起面孔，用一種敵意的姿態「强迫執行」，而不普遍地向人解釋淸楚一個所以然，還認爲「民可使由之，不可使知之」，則又似乎近於「壓迫」了。</p>
<p>###</p>
<p>時事之熱閙，至今而洋洋大觀，無所不備矣。國外國內，文塲武塲，莫非驚險節目。試讀每一家新聞紙，每一天所記之新奇故事，幾乎目不暇給。除國際之縱橫排闔，國內之虎鬬能爭，是爲「要聞」外，更有許多小說性的趣事，「熊猫」「楊妹」等等，穿括其間，如讀山海經，如披搜神記，嚮使聊齋之「蒲」閱微之「紀」，生於現代，於此等異聞材料之層出不窮，必表甚大之歡迎。（現在則「銀幕業」者，對楊妹之類，認爲可居之奇。）</p>
<p>「民以食爲天」，此通義也。「吃飯穿衣」，又熟語也。熟帶之人，每不需衣，而不能不食；則食之於「生」，尤密切矣。觀於年來糧價飛騰，必繼之以「活不了」之呼籲，歷史上齊桓趙武以國君之尊貴，到挨餓之時，亦要親自爬到樹梢，探雀　而食，可知無論貧富貴賤，中外古今，任何英雄好漢，不能對自己的肚皮嘔氣。所以「賣馬」劇中，秦叔寳疲困店房，忽聞一聲，「吃飯去！」而頓然淸醒，有驚　之表情。「盤關」一劇之守關兵卒，側立打磕冲，忽聞一聲「吃麵！」遽呼「好鹹滷」，有　涎欲滴之意態。其表現人生最需吃飯，至爲深刻，令人不勝同感。</p>
<p>按生理學說「人身如爐」，爐之能促其熱，能舉其職者，以燃料之從上添入，源源不絕，其爐灰又從下淘出，成爲新陳代謝之幾杼也。若但見爐灰之出於下，而不見薪炭之添於上，則爐必冷，火必息，如廢物，如僵石矣。故以身喩爐，顯而易見，飲食於上，猶添薪加灰也；排洩於下，猶淘爐出灰也。如人可以不食而生，則上海之許多汽車可不須排行趕早到站，候買汽油矣。（見報載「油荒」新聞，汽車隊有趕買之辛苦，宛如　民之領賑糧。）然則楊妹之「九年不食一而行動如常，視「左氏浮夸一關於「息夫人三年不言」如何云云之事蹟，其爲夸張，抑又甚焉！</p>
<h3>藝樓雜詩</h3>
<p>— 施叔範</p>
<p>病蘇真訝市朝移！粟帛通神價不　，戶內愁深黃浦水，城頭日落大梁旗。籲天眷顧要三變，下十張皇無一宜。起聽蚊雷隨處動，炎雲晦寒夜何其？</p>
<p>草盛樓深榴火圍，諸般幽想自何來？離離短樹天難測，窈窈繁星夜可哀，，兵屑寒消原上骨，肝風紅　掌心雷。大危壓頂淸流賤，諾諾猶聞限楚材。</p>
<p>見螢</p>
<p>墮風欹露爲誰驚？不定螢如亂後情，辛苦草間憐力薄，痴紅無奈到天明。</p>
<p>鐮月剖天白露深，露中螢火有升沉，觀星不信天無眼，注視流人默默心。</p>
<p>余越園藏有萬年少繪贈顧亭林　秋江別思圖曾索一觀追紀以句</p>
<p>生死交情出佛門，無聲相對更酸辛，料知抱布何方去？另畫江山贈故人。（時年少已遁跡沙門，顧亦易服作布客裝。）</p>
<p>墨汁淋漓筆欲飛，詎聞滿紙挽危機？從來一樣被人笑，多管興亡是布衣。</p>

<h3>National Army Launches Pincer Attack on Longhai Railway, Rapid Units Enter Kaifeng, Generals Gather in Shaanxi to Confer on Bandit Suppression Strategy</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Xi'an, 25th] Generals have gathered in Xi'an and are holding a meeting at a certain location to make new decisions regarding cooperation on future bandit suppression strategies in the Northwest and military education. Chairman Zhu Shaoyu of Shaanxi Province returned to Xi'an from Shanghai this afternoon after being summoned for official business.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Xi'an, 25th] The President received Zhang Zhizhong, Ma Hongbin, Ma Bufang, and more than ten division and brigade commanders at his residence here today. In addition to inquiring about the military and political situation in various regions, he also commended the generals for their performance in the battle to annihilate bandits in the Jing and Wei River valleys. It is reported that the President will return to Nanjing within days.</p>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Lanzhou, 25th] Ma Jiyuan, commander of the 12th Division, arrived in Xi'an this afternoon on a special plane from Xining after being summoned by the President. He will pay his respects to the President and attend the military conference.</p>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Xuzhou, 25th] The National Army along the Longhai Railway is rapidly advancing in a pincer attack towards Biancheng (Kaifeng). The National Army under Qiu Qingquan, moving from the west, captured Lanfeng yesterday and has now pressed on to Ba Wang, annihilating one battalion of the 2nd Division of the First Bandit Column. The National Army under Sun Yuanliang, moving from the east, captured Zhongmu yesterday and continues to advance towards Biancheng. Furthermore, the majority of the bandits fleeing from southwestern Shandong still occupy the area around Sui County and Qi County.</p>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Nanjing, 25th] According to an urgent telegram from the Yudong (Eastern Henan) front line of the Military News Agency at 9:30 PM on the 25th: Today, the National Army's eastward advancing force and westward advancing force, together with the Kaifeng garrison that shifted its position to the outskirts on the 22nd, launched a fierce encirclement and suppression campaign against the 10th Column of the Chen (bandits) force, which was covering the retreat. Local defense teams in the Gu area behind the bandits also rose up to attack the bandits' rear. The bandits were unable to withstand the attacks and fled southward. The vanguard of the National Army's rapid units entered Kaifeng City at 9:00 PM on the 25th and is currently searching and suppressing the remaining bandits in the surrounding areas. The telegram also stated: The various National Army forces had cleared the remaining bandits in the areas surrounding Lanfeng by the 24th and recaptured Lanfeng City. The National Army, which annihilated the 3rd Battalion of the 6th Regiment of the 2nd Division of the Chen (bandits) First Column at Longtanggang on the afternoon of the 24th, had advanced to the vicinity of Longhuzhai, northeast of Qi County, in the evening and is currently attacking Qi County. The powerful forces advancing westward from Mahuozhuang (12 kilometers southwest of Lanfeng) and Miaojunying (approximately 15 kilometers southwest of Lanfeng) advanced directly towards Kaifeng after defeating the bandits' weak resistance. The National Army, advancing southward from Heze, defeated the 10th Division of the Chen (bandits) Sixth Column east of Kaocheng and recaptured Sanyizhai (7 kilometers northwest of Lanfeng) on the evening of the 24th. The remaining bandits fled southward, and the National Army is still in pursuit. A certain unit of the National Army west of Kaifeng recaptured Zhongmu on the 24th and is now taking advantage of the victory to rapidly advance towards Biancheng.</p>
<h3>He Yingqin States in the Legislative Yuan That the Fall of Kaifeng Was Unexpected and Its Impact on the Central Plains War Situation Is Still Minor</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 25th] Minister of National Defense He Yingqin made a statement on the recent Central Plains war situation at a temporary secret meeting of the Legislative Yuan on the 24th. His report has been organized and published by the Secretariat of the Legislative Yuan (the main points of the report were published in yesterday's newspaper).</p>
<p>According to He, regarding the Central Plains war situation, the Supreme Commander and all staff members of the General Staff have devoted themselves to the planning of operations and the guidance of troop movements from the beginning to the present, hoping to capture and annihilate the main forces of the Chen and Liu bandits in this battle to stabilize the military situation for bandit suppression in Central China. The Battle of Kaifeng is actually a part of this overall campaign. If the city had not fallen, the results would naturally have been achieved more quickly. Unfortunately, its fall has had some impact on the progress of the campaign, but it is not a major obstacle. In the past, Baoji in Shaanxi Province fell, but the main force of the Peng (bandits) was eliminated by us in eastern Gansu, and Baoji and other counties were quickly recovered. This is one example. Kaifeng is the capital of Henan Province, with many civil servants and residents, and should be defended with particular determination. The General Staff had allocated three National Army regiments and six security force regiments to Kaifeng, and temporarily added another National Army regiment, totaling ten regiments. It was originally hoped that they could hold out for at least ten days. It was anticipated that our reinforcements would break through the bandit forces along the way and reach the outskirts of Kaifeng in less than ten days, forming an inner and outer pincer attack. Unexpectedly, the bandits began attacking the city on the 17th and broke through the city gates on the 18th, resulting in street fighting. This fact was unexpected. After receiving this news, Chief of General Staff Gu flew to Zhengzhou, and the Supreme Commander also flew to inspect the situation, hoping to get reinforcements there as soon as possible. However, because the Kaifeng City had been breached too quickly, the reinforcements could not reach it in time. By the 22nd, communication within the city was cut off, and the situation was unclear.</p>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Beiping, 25th] He Yingqin telegraphed here today, stating that due to unfinished business in Nanjing, his trip north would be postponed.</p>
<h3>Weng Wenhao Responds to Henan Petition Delegation, Decides to Increase Disaster Relief Funds for Kaifeng, Establish Relief Stations, and Provide Accommodation for Students</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Nanjing, 25th] A delegation of Henan natives residing in Nanjing petitioned the government to quickly allocate substantial funds for post-war disaster relief in Kaifeng. On the afternoon of the 25th, they visited Premier Weng Wenhao to present their petition. Weng Wenhao personally received them, and He Yingqin, Gu Zhenggang, Yu Dawei, Zhou Yichun, Zhu Jiahua, and others also participated in the explanation. The petition delegation made three demands: (1) Please allocate 500 billion yuan to help refugees and youth; (2) Send senior officials to Zhengzhou to personally handle the relief efforts; (3) Ensure the safety of Zhengzhou. Weng responded that the Executive Yuan had already allocated 45 billion yuan on the 25th and would send personnel to Xuzhou, Zhengzhou, and other places to handle relief matters. Regarding the requested 500 billion yuan, due to limited financial resources, it was actually quite difficult. The petition delegation insisted that at least 200 billion yuan should be allocated. Premier Weng agreed to increase it by another 50 billion yuan and would consider increasing it further based on the economic situation. Regarding relief matters, the relevant ministers replied as follows: (1) The government has decided to establish relief stations in Pukou, Xuzhou, Shangqiu, Hankou, and Zhengzhou; (2) Gu Zhenggang will personally fly to Zhengzhou to inspect the situation of the disaster victims and supervise the handling of relief efforts; (3) Refugees and students will be allowed to ride military vehicles free of charge; (4) Henan students arriving in Nanjing will be accommodated by the Ministry of Education.</p>
<h3>A Glimpse of the Tragic Situation When Kaifeng Became a Sea of Fire</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Nanjing, 25th] Chen, an official from the Henan Department of Education who escaped from Kaifeng after its fall, arrived in Nanjing on the 25th, becoming the first person to escape from the jaws of death to the capital. He left Kaifeng on the morning of the 20th. According to him: On the morning of the 17th, the bandits engaged the 5th and 7th Security Regiments at the Da Di in the southeast of Biancheng, resulting in fierce and tragic fighting. The security forces suffered heavy losses due to a lack of ammunition. When the bandits approached the southeastern suburbs in the evening, the citizens calmly assisted in the battle. On the 18th, our air force began to fly over the city to assist in the battle, and the buildings in Nanguan were completely destroyed by bombing, causing a large number of civilian deaths. The bandits' offensive did not abate in the slightest. A certain regiment of the 66th Division was routed by the bandits outside Xiaonanmen. Two regiments of the 119th Brigade were sent to reinforce the area, but they were soon broken through. After entering the city, the bandits proceeded along Waimahao Street, Muchang Street, Daxiaozhifang Street, and Congfu Pit, and detoured to the West Street of the Provincial Government to attack the City Defense Headquarters and the Provincial Government. Another force advanced from Nantujie through Gulou Street and Xufu Street to the back street of the Provincial Government to attack the Provincial Government. Chairman Liu and other civil and military officials firmly defended the Provincial Government, awaiting reinforcements. On the 20th, the Provincial Government was bombarded and caught fire. At the same time, many other places in the city were also bombed and caught fire. The situation was particularly tragic on West Street, back street and Gulou Street with many residents and students dying. When he left the city, the surviving residents were cowering among the ruins, their cries shaking the heavens. Furthermore, thirty-two students from Henan University also escaped to the capital.</p>
<h3>Liu Maoen Escapes Danger, Safely Arrives in Lanfeng</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Xuzhou, 25th] Chairman Liu Maoen of Henan Province safely arrived in Lanfeng at 4:00 PM on the 24th.</p>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Nanjing, 25th] He Yingqin informed the Henan Provincial representatives on the afternoon of the 25th that Chairman Liu Maoen of Henan Province had escaped from a certain passage in Kaifeng at 5:00 PM on the 24th and arrived in Lanfeng safely. Li Zhongnian, commander of the 66th Division, which was defending Biancheng, committed suicide after being seriously wounded in the leg. Zhang, the commander of the 13th Brigade under his command, was captured unconscious after suffering serious injuries. Many other regimental commanders and soldiers were killed in action.</p>
<h3>Legislative Yuan Passes Temporary Motion to Form Henan Military and Civilian慰問团</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Nanjing, 25th] The fifteenth meeting of the first session of the Legislative Yuan was held on the 25th, chaired by Sun Ke. After the meeting opened at 9:30 AM, the first item on the agenda was the report on matters, the minutes of the previous meeting were approved, and it was decided to submit the draft監察法案 from the監察院 for review, the revised draft貨物稅條例 articles three, four, and five, and the draft國產菸酒類稅條例 article four from the政院 and six other draft laws from the former政院 to the relevant committees for review. Then, the emergency temporary motion of Duan Jianmin and others to organize a Henan military and civilian慰問团 to go to Henan to慰問 the military and civilians, inspect the actual situation, and advise the行政院 to quickly allocate substantial funds to救濟 the people who died in Bian Zheng was discussed. After one hour of discussion, it was decided to expand the scope of the 慰問 section to all battlefields.</p>
<p>The meeting continued at 3:00 PM in the afternoon, and a total of eight proposals were processed, including proposals to amend the工會法, to establish a烈士後族學校 in each province, to delineate the undetermined border between China and Myanmar, and to organize a赴日調査团, which were separately submitted for review or research. The meeting adjourned at 6:00 PM.</p>
<h3>Another Victory on the Western Section of the Jiaoji Railway, National Army Enters Longshan, Vanguard of the Jinpu Railway Advances to the Vicinity of Jieshou</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Jinan, 25th] The National Army on the western section of the Jiaoji Railway achieved another victory. Starting on the evening of the 23rd, the bandits, with the Ninth and Bohai Columns and local Eighth Route Army units, attempted to break through the outer defenses of Jinan. The National Army adopted mobile tactics and lured the bandits to a favorable area between Licheng and Guodian before dusk on the 24th.

<h3>Bandit Forces Outside Qinhuangdao Shift Westward, Changli Launches Defense Battle, National Army Firmly Defends the City and Stubbornly Awaits Reinforcements</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Qinhuangdao, 25th] The fighting in eastern Hebei on the 25th was most intense between Qinhuangdao and Beidaihe. The National Army captured Muyizhai, 10 kilometers southwest of Qinhuangdao on the north side of the railway, at noon and continued to encircle and attack Caigezhuang, northeast of Beidaihe. The bandits have been surrounded. The fighting outside Qinhuangdao began on the 24th, and the sound of gunfire has receded. The 11th Column of bandits, which was attacking the outer defenses of Qinhuangdao, shifted westward and joined forces with the bandits besieging Changli, launching a fierce attack on Changli. The defending forces in Changli were relatively weak. After a bloody battle with the bandits on the outer defenses, they withdrew from the Beishan Heights and the city's suburban bunkers at dusk to firmly defend the city. The bandits' artillery fire was fierce, causing considerable damage in the city and starting fires in many places. Communication with this area has been lost. There was still no definite news on the morning of the 25th. It is judged that the defending forces are likely stubbornly holding out in the underground tunnels, awaiting reinforcements. Houfengtai, Anshan, Shimen, and other stations west of Changli were captured by the bandits on the 24th. The Luan River Bridge was protected by the National Army and remained intact. On the morning of the 25th, a unit of reinforcements arriving in Qinhuangdao from Huludao landed and advanced from Qinhuangdao.

<h3>Interrogation of Leaked Secret Meeting News, Huge Disturbance in the Legislative Yuan, Decision to Form a Temporary Committee to Thoroughly Investigate</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Nanjing, 25th] During the morning meeting of the Legislative Yuan on the 25th, the Nanjing Xinmin Daily published a review of the military situation at the secret meeting of the院 on the 24th, revealing the secret of the meeting without reservation, causing a huge disturbance. This issue was first raised orally by Xiang Jutan after the reporting of matters was completed. Chen Kewen and Zhang Daohang pointed out that the news of the secret meetings of the Finance, Finance, and Foreign Affairs committees had also been repeatedly leaked recently, and attention should be paid to them together. Other speaking members all advocated thoroughly investigating where the news was leaked from, and condemned the Xinmin Daily's biased recording technology for such secret news, with ulterior motives. Some even said that there were Communist bandit tail elements or Third International spies mixed into the Legislative Yuan. Secretary-General Zhang Yuantai immediately asked for permission from President Sun to stand up and declare: At the meeting on the 24th, there were absolutely no journalists present to interview, and the court stenographers were always strictly prohibited from contacting journalists, and guaranteed that if there was any dereliction of duty by the Secretariat, they would be fully responsible, hoping that the members would form a committee to investigate thoroughly in order to clarify the responsibility. At this point, the members' target of attack became more concentrated on the female member Deng Jixing alone. Wu Wangji advocated调阅the original manuscript of the news to辨认 the handwriting, and Xie Chengzi said: The Xinmin Daily wrote out the content of each member's speech, which could never be done by people outside the meeting, and accused Deng Jixing herself of "strictly prohibiting the Air Force from blindly bombing cities." The temporary motion was also prominently published, which was enough to affect morale and people's hearts. Deng defended herself on this point, but was booed by the meeting. President Sun then declared a break to calm the disturbance. After the meeting continued, President Sun explained that Deng should be allowed to speak, but said: "Committee Member Deng, please speak from the position of a member, not from the position of a newspaper owner." Deng then argued that although she was the person in charge of the Nanjing Xinmin Daily, she could not prohibit reporters from interviewing just because she was a member, and that the news about the secret meeting was not only published by Xinmin Daily on the 25th. Zhang Daofan said that no matter who leaked the secret news, it must be thoroughly investigated. Otherwise, if this continues, the Legislative Yuan will inevitably be regarded as naive and confused, and that freedom of the press is limited, and the政院 should also be responsible for investigating the source of the newspaper news. Then, female member Tan Tiwu spoke to defend Deng, with an arrogant attitude, far-fetched reasoning, and emphasized that male members should not bully female members, which was reprimanded by the majority of male and female members. At this point, the meeting demanded to stop the discussion. As a result of the vote, the matter was finally handed over to the Temporary Committee for investigation. Finally, President Sun stood up and addressed the meeting, stating briefly: The Xinmin Daily had the freedom to interview and publish, but military secrets were related to national security, and every citizen had the obligation not to leak them. The Xinmin Daily's headline clearly stated: "Legislative Yuan Military Secret Meeting," how could it be wantonly publicized? It should be known that in this military crisis of bandit suppression, the leakage of military secrets to a rebellious enemy is dangerous. Otherwise, why hold a secret meeting? He hoped that the members, reporters, and newspaper owners present would pay attention to this matter, in order to fulfill their national obligations and assist the government in keeping secrets. Finally, with the approval of 309 votes (435 members present), it was passed that each of the 21 standing committees should nominate one person to form a temporary committee (the committee member from the Criminal Law Committee would be appointed as the convener) for thorough investigation.</p>

<h3>The Executive Yuan Passes the Budget: Efforts to Achieve a Balance Between Revenue and Expenditure; To Be Submitted to the Legislative Yuan for Deliberation on the 29th</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 25th] The Executive Yuan passed the national general budget for the second half of the 37th year in a temporary meeting held at 3:00 PM on the 25th, and it will be submitted to the Legislative Yuan for deliberation on the 29th. It is reported that the revenue portion of the general budget is approximately 5 million billion, while the expenditure portion reaches over 7 million billion, nearly 1 million billion more than the revenue. The shortfall will be covered by US aid and proceeds from the sale of relief supplies. The expenditure portion of the budget prioritizes suppressing the rebellion, with military spending accounting for over 47% of the total. The next priority is transportation, focusing on economic construction, followed by education expenses, which account for 15% of the total proportion, in accordance with constitutional provisions. Social affairs are next, including relief efforts, accounting for a considerable proportion. Tax revenue constitutes the bulk of the revenue portion, especially commodity tax, which amounts to approximately 1 million billion yuan. Customs duties are second, at over 700,000 billion yuan, and direct taxes are approximately 400,000 billion yuan, totaling over 3 million billion yuan, with the remainder from other revenue. The compilation of this general budget fully demonstrates the government's efforts to achieve a balance between income and expenditure. After the proposal was presented at the political affairs meeting on the 25th, Chief Comptroller Xu Kan first reported on the compilation process of the expenditure portion, followed by Minister of Finance Wang Yunwu, who reported on the compilation process of the revenue portion, after a thorough discussion, it was passed.</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Dewey Nominated as US Presidential Candidate</h3>
<p>At the US Republican National Convention on the evening of the 24th, a vote was held to elect a presidential candidate. Those participating in the competition included New York Governor Dewey, Senator Taft, industrialist Stassen, diplomat Vandenberg, California Governor Warren, and Supreme Commander of the Allied Forces in Tokyo, MacArthur. They are all first-class figures in the United States, not only highly regarded within the Republican Party but also hoped for as presidential candidates by people at home and abroad. Although none of them received a majority in the first or second vote, by the third vote, as most of the candidates had abandoned their bids, Dewey received 1,094 votes and was elected, with no one voting against him. This is truly Dewey's supreme honor, making him Truman's only formidable opponent.</p>
<p>In our article "The Beginning of the American Political Season," we analyzed the American political situation and the competition among the parties, pointing out that the Republican Party had a better chance in this year's presidential election. However, with so many talented people within the Republican Party, we dared not prematurely predict who would be the future master of the White House. Now that Dewey has been nominated as the Republican presidential candidate, he must be confident that he will enter the White House. Indeed, there is not much difference between the Democratic and Republican parties on domestic and foreign policies. Whether it is Truman or Dewey, American national policy will not undergo major changes in principle. President Truman has also stated to the Soviet Union that regardless of the outcome of this year's election, the policy towards the Soviet Union will not change. However, there will inevitably be differences in the priorities of implementing national policies. Therefore, we are particularly interested in Dewey's views on China.</p>
<p>I remember that in February or March of this year, when the US government and public were hotly debating whether to aid Europe or China first, Dewey issued a "Policy Toward China" statement, advocating that China should be actively aided economically. The US Republican National Committee passed it and sent it to President Truman and Congress. In the statement, Dewey criticized the Democratic Party's policy toward China, saying: "The Truman administration not only lacks a policy to promote peace but also contributes to the Soviet Union's aggression around the world. In the Far East, the US government sacrifices China and reaches a compromise with Stalin, allowing him to control Northeast China." Recently, Dewey has been making campaign speeches everywhere, all based on this. On May 26, in a speech in New York, he said, "We cannot withhold the aid that China needs, we cannot win lasting peace." Therefore, we look forward to the future, and no matter what the US policy toward China will be, it will only become more active. As long as we can uphold the principle of "self-reliance" and constantly strengthen ourselves, Dewey will not disappoint us if he is elected president.</p>
<h3>Tightening Credit and Restricting Issuance</h3>
<p>Yesterday, prices in the Shanghai market rose frantically. In the afternoon, the retail price of rice nearly hit 20 million yuan, and the prices of various major commodities also rose by 20-30%. People were alarmed and lived in constant fear. However, as of this writing, we have not heard of any emergency measures being prepared by the central authorities. It seems that they are watching this runaway horse, helpless, and letting it run wild. Not only will ordinary people feel an increasing threat to their survival, but everyone feels that the government must not continue to be perfunctory.</p>
<p>According to relevant financial sources, the government will still focus on tightening credit, and selling US aid materials is its main method. Some even say that as long as 60 million US dollars worth of materials are sold, all the legal currency can be recovered, which seems very optimistic. If that is the case, why not sell them? Secondly, there is the promotion of treasury bonds, but the effectiveness is obvious. We believe that to truly tighten credit, one should start by immediately restricting currency issuance.</p>
<p>Speaking of the promotion of short-term treasury bonds, the first to be piloted were types A and B. The term for type C is set at one week, which is actually equivalent to the previously banned "delivery trading," the only difference being that one is stocks and the other is treasury bonds. We need to study whether the sales of treasury bonds will increase rapidly after delivery trading is restored, so as to achieve the purpose of tightening credit and recovering legal currency.</p>
<p>Since treasury bonds were listed, their sales have reportedly improved. For example, on the 23rd, in a single day, they reached 117.492 billion, which is a considerable amount. However, there is too much floating capital, making it difficult to absorb. The recent soaring prices, especially the surge yesterday, clearly deviate from the norm and cannot be effectively addressed by the usual methods of tightening credit. Although the authorities have expanded the issuance locations to the five major cities of Nanjing, Tianjin, Hankou, Guangzhou, and Chongqing, and have expanded the issuing institutions from the National Bank to the stock exchange, and even want to extend the terms of types A and B to type C, which is equivalent to delivery trading, it seems doubtful whether relying solely on this method can effectively tighten credit and effectively suppress prices.</p>
<p>The purpose of issuing treasury bonds is originally to tighten credit, so that a part of the legal currency can be recovered. Now that the policy has been determined, it is natural that every effort should be made to promote sales. At this time of runaway prices, which cannot be contained, we also place deep hopes on it. However, if the reasons why sales were not smooth in the past still exist, then how much power will the stimulus caused by the change to delivery trading have? It is unwise to overestimate it. Moreover, dealing with inflation, dealing with the machinations of floating capital, and dealing with the positive effect of price fluctuations are not just about the numbers shown in the treasury bond sales, but whether this strategy can actually be effective. Therefore, while promoting treasury bonds, we must still stop expansion, so that the expected effect can be achieved. Otherwise, issuing more treasury bonds will only temporarily increase the state treasury's revenue, and its role will still be limited to finance rather than monetary policy. Moreover, with relatively high interest rates, the new treasury bonds that will be reissued when they mature will inevitably increase. The state treasury's burden will increase, and in the end, it will have to resort to issuance, which will further inflate the currency, fill the capital with floating capital, and prices may become even more uncontrollable!</p>
<p>At the end of May, Minister Wang announced a total of 135 trillion, which is almost double the figure of 70 trillion at the end of March. This proves that the current inflation is still progressing rapidly. If this bad trend cannot be quickly curbed, even if the issuance of type C treasury bonds is successful, and a small portion of floating capital can be recovered in the stock exchange market, what benefit will it have for general prices and the general economy? Moreover, what is taken in by the left hand is released by the right hand, and the floating capital in the Northeast, North China, Central China, and West China are flocking to Shanghai from all directions. This is just as a certain financial authority said, "When the flood is rampant, building dikes will not be effective." Moreover, just looking at the listing of type C treasury bonds, its effectiveness may not even be comparable to the so-called building of dikes, let alone flood prevention. Therefore, we believe that tightening credit should be a lesson from the past and start from the big picture. For example, the proposal by Municipal Councilor Xu Yongzuo and others to organize an issuance supervision committee to curb inflation seems to be a fundamental remedy. If this is not done, and one only focuses on minor details, such as the rumored creation of type C treasury bonds, diverting floating capital to the south, and temporarily selling materials, it is nothing more than a self-consoling method of treating the symptom rather than the cause. Based on past performance, how much contribution will it make to tightening credit and recovering legal currency?</p>

<h3>Grain in Changchun To Be Rescued by Air Transport</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 25th] Over 30 legislators from the Northeast, including Yan Menghua, jointly sent a letter to Premier Weng, requesting him to find a way to help Changchun City, which was under siege and cut off from food sources.

<h3>Rental Disputes Occur in Tieling</h3>
<p>[Our Shenyang Dispatch, 22nd] In the Liaoning Provincial Department of Finance's expanded spring plowing plan, the area of rice paddies in Tieling can increase by 8,000 mu compared to last year. Currently, because Korean farmers and landlords have rental disputes, the work of assisting plowing with tractors has been temporarily suspended. In the rice paddies in the Shatuozi area of Tieling, most landlords are adopting a wait-and-see attitude and are unwilling to invest in spring plowing. Therefore, Korean farmers applied for tractors to assist in plowing. The tractor management office believed that most of the applicant Korean farmers were poor farmers, so it allowed them to be exempt from fuel costs and provided free plowing services, with good results. After plowing 4,000 mu of land, the landlords came forward to compete for benefits, demanding that the tractors plow for them and that they receive more benefits during the autumn harvest, which aroused opposition from the Korean farmers, who demolished the small bridges in the fields, preventing the tractors from passing and unable to continue working. Currently, Yang Kai, a special commissioner for spring plowing supervision specially sent by the Political Committee's Department of Farmland Water Conservancy, is responsible for mediation. The Suppression General Political Committee believes that the Liaoning Provincial Government's promulgated measures for the use of wasteland have been obstructed by local forces and have not been smoothly implemented. It has ordered the Liaoning Provincial Government to strictly order all counties to allocate uncultivated wasteland to poor farmers for cultivation in accordance with the provisions of these measures, and landlords must not disobey, forming rental disputes and affecting increased production.</p>

<h3>Rice Prices Rise Frequently Everywhere: Running Wild Like a Loose Horse; Authorities Hold Emergency Meeting to Maintain People's Food Supply</h3>
<p>[Our Zhenjiang Dispatch, 24th] Recently, a large amount of floating capital from the Northeast and North China has moved south, causing prices to rise several times a day like a loose horse, creating a chaotic market situation.

<p>[Our Changshu Dispatch, 24th] Here, the prices of various items have been rising directly in recent days, and the rice and yarn markets are in a chaotic state.

<h3>Plutocrats in Japan</h3>
<p>— Wu Jiatang</p>
<p>Already a Dishonorable Term</p>
<p>The term "plutocrat" is already a dishonorable one in today's Japan. If one were to joke with a Japanese person, one might declare him to be a plutocrat. The effect would be as swift as calling him an old militarist.</p>
<p>Japanese plutocrats such as Mitsui, Mitsubishi, and Sumitomo, were in the past allied with Japan's aggressive forces, promoting policies of invasion and trampling all over East Asia. Therefore, after Japan's surrender, the plutocrats were placed alongside Japan's military and war potential on the list of things to be eliminated. This was because the Allied Supreme Commander knew that if the plutocrats were allowed to continue to exist, Japan would once again embark on the old path of aggression. At the same time, from a political and economic point of view, the plutocrats represented the concentration of wealth and its potential power. Japan's people are now leaning left, and the unequal distribution of wealth could at any time cause a major explosion, allowing the Japanese Communist Party to take the opportunity to rise amidst the chaos.</p>
<p>The Allied Supreme Commander's handling of the plutocrat problem seems to focus on a systematic method of dissolution. Of course, the main starting point is to dissolve these large wealth groups as soon as possible. However, in addition to this goal, there are several other aspects that must be seriously considered. First, the dissolution work must be carried out with both courage and caution, so as not to cause chaos in the entire economy, allowing the communist forces to take advantage of the situation. Because today's Japan under Allied Supreme Commander occupation does not outwardly show the plutocrats' past dominance over everything in Japan, their past influence was deeply rooted and certainly controlled the economic destiny of every Japanese person. Therefore, the Allied Supreme Commander, in dealing with this major issue related to the entire national economy of Japan, must act cautiously. Although some people advocate using the method of "cutting through a tangled mess with a quick knife" to eliminate the existing system, in order to avoid causing economic paralysis, it is necessary to proceed step by step and promote it in a planned manner.</p>
<p>Some outside observers have criticized the Allied Supreme Commander for not dissolving the plutocrats quickly enough. However, it must be understood that the Allied Supreme Commander is subject to the control of the Far Eastern Commission when carrying out its work. In addition to eliminating Japan's military and war potential, the Far Eastern Commission also instructed the Allied Supreme Commander to implement a basic policy. This instruction is: (1) To assist the Japanese people in developing economic and cultural relations with other countries in a democratized society, in order to meet their reasonable individual and national needs, and to allow them to live in peace with other countries forever. (2) To allow Japan to maintain its industries for making a living, and to use this value to pay fair reparations in kind, but industries that could rearm her are not included. For this purpose, Japan may be allowed to obtain raw materials. Japan will also be allowed to participate in world trade relations once it joins. Based on this meaning, the Allied Supreme Commander passed a Holding Company Liquidation Act in January of the year before last, and at the same time established a Holding Company Liquidation Committee to liquidate major holding companies. The work in the first year was to thoroughly investigate the internal affairs of 41 holding companies and 1,200 first-tier subsidiaries, and designate them as "restricted" companies. This meant that the shareholders of these companies could not freely withdraw and transfer their shares to others in order to conceal their ownership. In addition, more than 2,000 "control groups" and associations were also strictly investigated, and the Japanese government was ordered to dissolve all of these industrial associations and abolish all laws and regulations that supported them. Japan's control groups are similar in nature to our country's trade associations. Within their own industry, they set prices, allocate raw materials, determine uniform wages, limit the output of different industries, and divide up the markets of each industry. At the end of the year before last, 63 companies were liquidated, and another 20 were liquidated last year. These companies include the industries of Mitsui, Mitsubishi, and other famous plutocrats. At the same time, under the decentralization law, 325 companies in the industrial sector, whose activities in the past involved every aspect of the lives of the Japanese people, will now also be dissolved. Among them, 144 companies will be forced to separate from all of their subsidiaries.</p>
<p>Existing statistics show that these designated control companies own a total of 1.58 billion shares, with a value of 6.3 billion yen. The Holding Company Liquidation Committee has taken over all of these assets, and has kept a large number of shares of these companies and their subsidiaries in custody. Liquidating these companies requires in-depth research into their finances and structure, which is a long and laborious reconnaissance work. At the same time, the Allied Supreme Commander is taking steps to prevent these large companies from rising again and controlling the Japanese economy. Anti-trust legislation was proposed in the second year of the occupation, and became law on July 14 of last year. It prohibits trusts, combinations, and cartels, and establishes a Fair Trade Commission to implement the content of this law. It also stipulates that no more than 100 former industrial association officials can participate in a new company. And the leaders of its subsidiaries are limited to one person when organizing a new company. Of course, the work of the Allied Supreme Commander in dissolving the power of the Japanese plutocrats will not be easy in the future. They are currently trying to sell the shares received by the Liquidation Committee. Changing the entire economic system of Japan still requires time, patience, determination, and wisdom.</p>

<p>[United Press International, Philadelphia, 25th] If Dewey leads the Republican Party to victory in the November election, the position of Secretary of State may be filled by his foreign policy advisor Dulles. According to Dulles's position, which is the same as Vandenberg's, he has always advocated an internationalist approach.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Philadelphia, 24th] Although Dewey may win, he will have to wait until the fourth ballot to obtain the necessary majority.</p>
<p>[U.S. News Service, Philadelphia, 24th] The Republican National Convention tonight, in the third ballot, unanimously nominated Dewey as the U.S. presidential candidate. Dewey, the governor of New York, will face the candidates of the Democratic Party and other parties in the November election. When the states were being called and New Hampshire was reached, Dewey had already obtained a majority of the 1,094 votes at the convention. New Hampshire's eight votes brought Dewey's total to 554. He only needed 548 votes to be elected. Dewey encountered considerable resistance in the first ballot from a coalition against Dewey. After the first ballot, he intensified his activities in the second ballot and finally won in the third ballot. At the beginning of the third round of nominations, Senator Taft was the first of the main contenders to drop out and endorse Dewey. Later, California Governor Warren also announced his withdrawal, followed by another candidate, Stetson, who also withdrew and urged a unanimous vote for Dewey.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Philadelphia, 24th] Dewey attended the Republican convention tonight and delivered a speech to the cheering delegates, accepting the nomination as the U.S. presidential candidate for the next term. His words vowed to promote national unity internally and build a world order of justice and peace externally. Dewey said, "At this time, a Republican must contribute his life to promoting human freedom. If the world is half free and half enslaved, we must strive peacefully to help people everywhere gain freedom." Regarding domestic unity, Dewey said, "I dare to guarantee that after January 20 next year, the U.S. government will show a sense of shared purpose."</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Philadelphia, 24th] Dewey, who was elected as the Republican presidential candidate, expressed great concern about the situation in our country when he met with the reporter of this agency alone. Dewey firmly supports large-scale financial and material assistance to China. He severely criticized the State Department's limited aid plan for China. Dewey expressed special concern for the war turmoil in our country. He hoped that after the Republican Party comes to power, it can provide China with aid of the same kind and in large quantities. Dewey is a staunch supporter of the bipartisan foreign policy. He strongly opposes Soviet expansionism, but he has opposed the government using legislation to suppress the Communist Party.</p>
<p>[United Press International, Washington, 24th] Democratic members of Congress agreed with President Truman's praise of Dewey as the "strongest" Republican presidential candidate. It is rumored that Truman believes that Dewey is the most difficult person to defeat among all the Republican candidates.</p>

<h3>Warsaw Conference Issues Declaration Demanding Establishment of All-German Government, Speedy Conclusion of Peace Treaty Stipulating Withdrawal of Allied Occupation Forces, Four-Power Control of the Ruhr, and Elimination of German Military Potential</h3>
<p>[United Press International, Prague, 25th] Warsaw diplomatic sources notified United Press International by long distance telephone on the 25th that Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov had left Warsaw for Moscow at 8:50 PM Greenwich time.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Warsaw, 25th] Authorities here believe that the Soviet Union has already established an East German state, temporarily headquartered in Leipzig. An official announcement is expected to be made on the evening of the 25th when Molotov and other foreign ministers of Eastern European countries leave Warsaw. "The Eight-Nation Foreign Ministers Conference issued a communiqué this morning condemning the Western Allies for violating all agreements relating to Germany,</p>
<p>and demanding: (1) Taking measures to ensure the disarmament of Germany; (2) Stipulating a definite period for the Four-Power control of the Ruhr industrial area and prohibiting the restoration of German military potential; (3) Establishing a temporary all-German government; (4) Formulating a peace treaty with Germany based on the Potsdam decisions; (5) Formulating measures to enable Germany to fulfill its reparations obligations to the countries it invaded. The communiqué also condemned a group of German elements for plotting to undermine the German-Polish border on the Oder-Neisse line, calling that border an inviolable line of peace. The 2,000-word communiqué accused the Six-Nation Conference in London of attempting to use Germany, especially the Ruhr area, to achieve British and American military and strategic goals, and also criticized the British, American, and French enticement of the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg.</p>
<h3>Cominform Simultaneously Convenes General Assembly</h3>

<h3>Military Government of Three Western German Occupation Zones to Be Reorganized</h3>
<p>[United Press International, Berlin, 25th] U.S. Military Governor for Germany, Lieutenant General Clay, organized a committee on the 25th, based on the three countries, to reorganize the military government. The British and French commanders have already appointed committees of the same nature.</p>
<h3>Four Powers Launch Cold War, Situation in Berlin Tense, Soviet Union Announces End of Joint Control</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Dispatch] London, 25th Broadcast: The Soviet side has begun formal actions today in an attempt to force the Western Allies to withdraw from Berlin. The Soviet zone of Berlin has been ordered not to allocate food to residents of the Western zone. The British and French countries responded with quick measures, also ordering a ban on the supply of food to the Soviet zone.</p>
<p>[United Press International, Berlin, 25th] The Soviet Union's "Cold War" strategy took a fascinating about-face turn on the 25th. Allied officials in Helmstedt announced that the Soviet military commander in Marienfelde said that freight trains from the West to Berlin could resume running from the 28th. If so, then the 2.5 million German residents in West Berlin would not starve, and the Soviet Union would abandon its policy of expelling the Allies from Berlin. Therefore, on the surface, the Soviet Union's final move will once again ease the Berlin crisis.</p>
<p>[United Press International, Berlin, 25th] Soviet Commander-in-Chief of the Occupation Forces in Germany, Sokolovsky, announced today that the Four-Power rule of Berlin has come to an end. The possibility of the Western Allies being expelled from Berlin sooner or later can also be seen for the first time. As the Soviet Union and the Western Allies launch a diplomatic and economic war in Berlin, the 2.5 million Germans in the U.S., British, and French occupation zones are caught in the crossfire between the two major forces. Responsible officials are studying in detail the U.S. Military Governor General Clay's statement on the 24th: "As far as we are concerned, unless we resort to military force, don't think about expelling us from Berlin." They pointed out that the phrases "as far as we are concerned" and "the Germans are also suffering" indicate the possibility of abandoning Berlin. A high-ranking official felt that if the Allied forces continued to be stationed in Berlin and made the Germans in their zone suffer from hunger, the Western countries might withdraw from Berlin.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Berlin, 25th] The Cold War in Berlin has become increasingly tense due to several actions and counter-actions by the Four Powers. A U.S. spokesman also said that the Soviet Union's order to implement currency reform is the final stage of Bolshevizing the Soviet zone. Residents in the British and American zones of Berlin began exchanging new marks this morning, making the division of Berlin a fait accompli. The Berlin Central Food Bureau, located in the Soviet zone, was ordered by the Soviet authorities to no longer distribute food supplied by the Soviet zone to the Western zone. Previously, the authorities of the four occupying countries each supplied a certain amount of food, which was handed over to the bureau for distribution throughout the city. British Commander-in-Chief Robertson and U.S. Commander-in-Chief Clay held a long talk last night to discuss countermeasures against the Soviet Union's cutting off of electricity to West Berlin and its blockading of railway traffic from Berlin to West Germany.</p>
<h3>U.S. Experts Go to West Germany to Study Steel Production Increase</h3>

The delegation is led by George Erten, Chairman of the Board of the U.S. Steel Export Corporation. Secretary of the Army Royal said that the delegates all believe that the increase in steel production must be achieved, which is related to the entire European revival.</p>
<h3>Unless Military Force Is Used, Britain Will Never Withdraw from Berlin, Foreign Secretary Bevin Declares in the House of Commons</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 25th] Foreign Secretary Bevin announced today that Britain is taking a consistent stand with the U.S. and France on the Berlin crisis, solemnly stating that only war can expel the Western Powers from Berlin. In answering questions in the House of Commons about the Berlin crisis, Bevin said that a dangerous situation has arisen in Berlin, where demonstrations are clearly forcing the Western Allies to withdraw from Berlin. Fortunately, the British authorities there have remained calm, which is gratifying.</p>
<p>We are in Berlin by right, and the Soviet Union has the ability to force us to leave, but it also knows that it must create a situation of conflict in order to force us to withdraw from Berlin. However, we will never withdraw from Berlin, and even if we are forced to withdraw, we will still return to Berlin. The Western Powers have notified the Soviet side that they are willing to allow the new currency in the Soviet zone to circulate universally in Berlin under the principle of Four-Power joint control, but the Soviet side insists that this matter can only be controlled independently by the Soviet authorities. If we were to accept this, it would be tantamount to giving up our rights in Berlin, and Britain will never agree to a new currency system in which the power to decide the amount of issuance is in the hands of others. The Soviet Union's attitude has forced the Western Powers to have no other way to go but to implement their own plans. Bevin went on to deny that the Soviet side had set up barrier balloons in the Berlin air corridor, and he did not believe that the situation would remain as unsettling as it is now forever. He revealed that the British, American, and French Powers have a general agreement in Berlin and maintain constant contact on the rapidly developing situation. When a Conservative member asked to what extent Britain and the U.S. would consider using force, Bevin said that he did not intend to say anything other than what he had already stated.</p>
<h3>U.S. Condemns Soviet Union for Violating Existing Agreements</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 24th] The State Department issued a statement today accusing the Soviet military authorities in Berlin of cutting off electricity to the Western zone and blockading food transportation, which is a violation of existing agreements.</p>
<h3>France's Attitude Is Firm</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Paris, 24th] A French Foreign Ministry spokesman said that France has a firm will to continue to stay in Berlin, and that it will not change due to the current Cold War. We can implement retaliation, we can cut off the supply of tap water and gas to the Soviet zone of Berlin, and the amount cut off can be even greater than the amount the Soviet Union cuts off to the Western zone.</p>
<h3>Truman Signs Conscription Law and Military Spending Bill</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 24th] President Truman signed the U.S. peacetime conscription bill into law today. It is expected that 200,000 to 250,000 people will be drafted into the army in the first year.

<p>[United Press International, Washington, 24th] The Far East Commission held a secret meeting tonight and passed a proposal by Australia to allow countries to send representatives to investigate the progress of Japanese industry.

<h3>Brief Biography of Dewey, U.S. Republican Presidential Candidate</h3>
<p>— Our Newspaper Archives</p>
<p>Dewey, the U.S. Republican presidential candidate, was unanimously confirmed, and this is his third time running for president. In 1940, some people tried to nominate Dewey as a presidential candidate, but the Republican convention decided on Willkie instead. This was his first failure. In 1944, Dewey was nominated as the Republican presidential candidate, but he failed again in the election. Although Dewey failed twice, he has the spirit of perseverance and is running for president for the third time.</p>
<p>Dewey was born in Owosso, Michigan in 1902. After graduating from the University of Michigan in 1923, he transferred to Columbia University to study law, graduating in 1925. He traveled to Europe and, after returning to his country, practiced law. From 1931, he served as a prosecutor in a district of New York. In 1935, he was appointed as a special prosecutor to expel hooligans in New York City and fight against the environment of evil forces, gaining considerable fame. In 1937, he was elected as county prosecutor. The following year, he was nominated by the Republican Party as a candidate for governor of New York, but he failed to be elected. In 1942, he was elected as the governor of New York State. In the 1946 New York State gubernatorial election, Dewey was re-elected.</p>
<p>Dewey lives on a farm in Pawling, New York, and has a happy family, a wife, and two children. During his tenure as governor of New York, he fully demonstrated his talent. He raised 62.3 million in postwar reconstruction funds, reduced income tax by 40 percent, strived for retirement benefits for veterans, arranged housing and education for veterans, reformed the New York State public health program, increased the salaries of public education personnel, promoted a bill banning public employees from striking, and so on, showing his good political achievements.</p>
<p>Dewey's political views: the current high cost of living is caused by inflation, while stimulating increased industrial production. He advocates reducing government spending, stopping speculation, encouraging savings, and putting the economy back on track. In terms of diplomacy: he hopes to establish a world of strong and free nations, so he should do his best to help Europe's revival, and promote Europe to become a great federation of free nations as a barrier to lasting peace to break the war crisis instigated by ambitious people.</p>
<p>Dewey advocates for closely aiding China. Last year, Dewey gave full explanations in several public speeches. He believes that China's current situation is very serious. If the entire China is lost, then all of Asia and Western Europe will be lost along with it, and the United States will become isolated. Therefore, the only way to benefit the United States is to assist China as soon as possible and resolve China's current predicament.</p>

He has also decided to start inspecting the materials in warehouses throughout the city today, and severely crack down on hoarding and speculation, in order to ruthlessly combat the price surge that occurred yesterday.</p>
<p>Chief Yu also issued a written statement yesterday regarding the Economic Police Team and the extension of curfew hours, as follows: "(1) I regret that the Economic Police Team of this bureau has not been able to achieve the ideal state. However, in the past, the Economic Police have made some minor contributions to suppressing the straight-line rise in prices and打击奸商市僧. The establishment of the Economic Police Team of this bureau was based on the provisions of Article 6, Paragraph 9 of the revised and promulgated organizational regulations of this bureau on April 15, 1946, regarding the execution of economic control laws and regulations, and began to perform its duties. On September 30, 1947, it was submitted to the city government for approval. In November 1947, the Police Headquarters of the Ministry of Interior issued Telegraph No. 19676 to coordinate with the General Outline for Mobilization and Suppression of Rebellion, and formulated the Implementation Plan for the Central Work of the Police during the Suppression of Rebellion. According to the provisions of Item 5 of ensuring local security in the plan, the Capital and Municipal Police Bureaus should establish economic sections or economic police brigades as needed according to the circumstances, and Telegraph No. 37 Mi Hai 010128 was issued to strictly handle the matter. Therefore, there is no doubt about the legal basis of the Economic Police. As for the issue of its abolition, if it is indeed the will of the people, it is expected that the higher authorities will consider it. However, even if it is abolished in the future, the central government will not abolish the economic control laws and regulations that punish speculative merchants during this period of suppression of rebellion. In order to make these laws and regulations effective, it is still necessary to establish a strong and effective enforcement agency. Although this bureau has the task of assisting in the implementation of economic control laws as part of its duties for maintaining public security, it is not the economic authority in charge. Maintaining general public security is already a heavy burden, and if the economic authority in charge can be responsible for direct enforcement in the future, and this bureau remains in an assisting position, it would be highly appreciated.</p>
<h3>Entertainment Venues Should Not Extend Hours</h3>
<p>(2) Regarding the resolution of the police affairs subcommittee of the City Council to extend curfew hours, there may be some errors in the wording of the original proposal. This is because there is currently no curfew regulation in this city, and what the councilors proposed was actually the extension of business hours for special businesses such as dance halls, theaters, restaurants, clubs, and other public entertainment venues. The reasons for this resolution are unclear, but during this period of mobilization and suppression of rebellion, the central government has repeatedly ordered frugality. At the same time, at a time when bandits are rampant everywhere and society is unstable, extending the business hours of entertainment venues is definitely not appropriate. I sincerely hope that the councilors will adhere to the principle of separation of powers and consider the current serious situation, and give serious consideration and assistance to this measure taken by this bureau for the benefit of the public and local public security."</p>
<h3>Garrison Commander Xuan Discusses Current Affairs, Strongly Advocates Thorough Reform; Economic Root Cause Lies in Inequality; Politics Should Strive to Win Over the Masses</h3>
<p>Xuan Tiewu, commander of the Songhu Garrison, gave a speech to reporters at 4:00 PM on the 25th, severely criticizing current malpractices and strongly advocating thorough reform. Xuan pointed out bluntly that the economic and political crises are becoming increasingly serious, and the military is divorced from politics and economics. If improvements are not made quickly and the matter is delayed further, the consequences will be unimaginable. Xuan first discussed the price problem, saying: The way to save the economic crisis is to address the root cause. In the past, with limited economic inspection personnel engaged in the inspection of gold and banknotes on the black market and hoarding and speculation, it was difficult to achieve the expected results. Therefore, the central and local governments and the people must thoroughly review the root causes of the current economic ills, and then determine the countermeasures to address the root cause. The current economic ills can be summed up in one word: "inequality." Social wealth is becoming increasingly concentrated, a few people live extravagantly, and most people cannot even get enough to eat. Under such circumstances, how can we talk about economic suppression of rebellion? Therefore, to seek economic reform, one "equal" character is enough.</p>
<h3>Organizing and Training the Masses to Protect Local Tyrants Is Impossible</h3>
<p>When discussing political matters, Xuan reviewed the strategies of the communists, saying that the party, government, military, economy, education, and culture are thoroughly integrated to achieve a true total war. However, on our side, the work of organizing and training the masses to develop self-defense forces has not been very effective. The main reason is that it "lacks a sufficient political significance." Under the continuous exploitation by corrupt officials, local bullies, and evil gentry, it is almost impossible to organize the general public to protect the interests of corrupt officials, local bullies, and evil gentry. They all know that if the communists come, the targets of the cleansing and struggle will definitely not be them. Therefore, "winning over the masses and winning back people's hearts" is an urgent measure for political reform. Xuan said: The military cannot be separated from politics and economics and stand alone. The military must be based on a clear political system and a stable economy in order to become strong and achieve the task of defeating the enemy.</p>
<h3>Total War Should Be Implemented Immediately</h3>
<p>Yi replied to the question about the security situation in the Songhu garrison area, saying: We are now dispatching more naval patrols, and coastal defenses have been strengthened. There should be no problems. He also revealed that the provinces south of the Yangtze River may implement the total war plan earlier, but it is estimated that the earliest time will still be after the Mid-Autumn Festival. He said: We should frankly admit that the reason why the provinces north of the Yangtze River have reached today's situation is that the total war plan was implemented too late. Now, the provinces south of the Yangtze River must learn from the lessons of the northern provinces and immediately implement total war, and engage in close coordination between military, political, and economic measures, in order to achieve the goals of eliminating hidden bandits militarily, thoroughly reforming the political style, organizing and training the masses, first stabilizing the economy, and then establishing a new system to protect the minimum living standards of the people. In this way, the Yangtze River can become a "golden city," and the expansion of the anti-communist military in the north of the Yangtze River can be expected in the near future.</p>
<h3>Heads of Five Agencies Deny Being Directors of the Military Friendship Association</h3>
<p>Songhu Garrison Commander Xuan Tiewu met with reporters at 4:00 PM yesterday and denied holding the title of director of the Military Friendship Association. The Shanghai Garrison Commander Chuan Zhengmo, Wusong Fortress Commander Shao Baichang, Shanghai Port Commander Zhou Lixing, and Shanghai Supply Director Chen Qian of the Joint Logistics Headquarters, who jointly handled the Liu case, also made the same statement.</p>
<h3>Limited-Price Movie Tickets Raised to 100,000, Other Seat Prices Unchanged</h3>
<p>[Report from this Newspaper] The 60,000-yuan limited-price seats in the city's first-run movie theaters will be raised to 100,000 yuan starting today. The number of limited-price seats is still stipulated to be 30%. Other seat prices will remain at the same three levels of 150,000, 200,000, and 300,000 yuan. This proposal was originally scheduled to be discussed at yesterday's municipal meeting, but since the municipal meeting was not held, it was directly approved by Mayor Wu. The implementation of the new limited price will only last for five days, and will be adjusted uniformly starting on the first of next month. It is said that the adjustment method will use this month's ticket price as a benchmark, and increase accordingly based on the percentage increase in the cost of living index for staff announced at the end of each month.</p>
<h3>Taxi Association Requests to Negotiate Prices Independently</h3>
<p>The Taxi Association requests the abolition of price controls and permission to negotiate prices independently in order to maintain operations and avoid deficits, due to the current soaring prices of all goods and different market prices in the morning and evening. It is now reported that the Public Utilities Bureau has scheduled a meeting with representatives of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce at 10:00 AM today in the bureau's conference room to discuss the case.</p>
<h3>Newly Appointed Director of the China Trust Bureau, Cheng Yuanfan, Takes Office</h3>

<h3>National Assembly Delegates Zhu Fengwei and Others Call for Replacing Conscription with Enlistment</h3>
<p>National Assembly Delegates Zhu Fengwei, Li Ximou, Chu Fengzhang, and others, citing the poor military service system and the concurrent system of conscription and voluntary enlistment, which has led to unscrupulous military service personnel colluding with arms dealers and township chiefs allocating funds to buy substitutes for military service, with each substitute soldier requiring 30 to 40 shi of white rice, while the conscripted soldiers are all unemployed vagrants who are not fit for combat, desert immediately after enlisting, and repeatedly change their names to enlist again, causing the people to suffer, rural areas to go bankrupt, call for replacing conscription with enlistment in order to protect the country's foundation and reassure the people.</p>
<h3>Business Community Sends Another Telegram to the Ministry of Finance Opposing the Collection of Property Tax</h3>
<p>[Report from this Newspaper] The Municipal Chamber of Commerce and the Municipal Industrial Preparatory Committee yesterday again jointly telegraphed the Executive Yuan Ministry of Finance, stating that the Shanghai business community is determined to unanimously oppose the collection of property tax.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Du Yuesheng, Director of the Industrial Association Preparatory Committee, and Xu Jilun, Chairman of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, will host a symposium at the China Merchants Bureau on the sixth floor this afternoon, inviting representatives from the business and industrial communities and the press in this city to discuss the issue of property tax collection.</p>
<h3>Sale of Silver and Copper Coins Should Not Be Confiscated</h3>
<p>[Report from this Newspaper] The Ministry of Judicial Administration recently stated that the practice of trading and selling silver coins is becoming increasingly prevalent, and there are more and more people engaged in selling them, which has resulted in many violations of the criminal code. The Municipal District Attorney's Office received instructions from the ministry yesterday, stating that "those who privately transport and sell silver or copper coins in various places do not constitute a crime, and the silver or copper coins should not be confiscated. Those who intend to sell but have not yet exchanged them for legal tender should also be considered as not constituting a crime."</p>
<h3>All Musicians in Dance Halls Demand a Salary Increase from Employers</h3>
<p>[Report from this Newspaper] All the musicians in the city's dance halls have recently jointly demanded a 100% salary increase from the dance hall employers. Their reasons are: Although Western musicians currently have an average monthly salary of about 80 million yuan, because their families are far away in the Philippines, if they are converted into US dollars and remitted back to support their families, the amount is very small and insufficient to maintain their lives. The average monthly salary for Chinese musicians is currently about 50 million yuan, which is also insufficient due to the high cost of living. Therefore, they have requested dance halls without air conditioning equipment to increase salaries monthly according to the cost of living index, and dance halls with air conditioning equipment to increase salaries by 100%. This matter is being mediated by the Social Affairs Bureau.</p>
<h3>Oil Shortage Temporarily Resolved, All Stations to Supply as Much as Possible Starting Today, Refueling Still Subject to Regulations</h3>
<p>[Report from this Newspaper] The city's severe gasoline shortage has been resolved after Mayor Wu has worked hard to find solutions for several days. After holding an emergency meeting on the 23rd, he contacted the Import and Export Management Committee and the Central Bank yesterday to facilitate the completion of the foreign exchange settlement procedures for 400,000 gallons of gasoline by various oil companies on the same day. Therefore, gas stations will be able to supply as much as possible starting today.</p>
<p>According to the Gasoline Allocation Committee: Vehicle refueling must still be handled in accordance with the refueling methods: (1) Refueling is only allowed once every three days. Each car is allowed to refuel up to 10 gallons, each truck is allowed to refuel up to 20 gallons, and each motorcycle is allowed to refuel up to 2 gallons. (2) Gas stations will not supply gasoline to cars that have already purchased the regulated amount of oil. (3) Cars that are being repaired or cannot be driven are not allowed to be towed to gas stations to refuel. The municipal government has specifically designated the Public Utilities Bureau and the Police Department to strictly enforce the above methods, and will dispatch a large number of inspectors to gas stations to inspect the refueling situation. If it is found that refueling is not done in accordance with the regulations, the oil purchase certificate will be revoked and never issued again.</p>
<h3>Studying Effective Countermeasures to Avoid a Repeat of Panic Buying</h3>
<p>It is learned that the city authorities have applied to the central government to increase the city's gasoline quota, or reallocate gasoline quotas across the country to make it more reasonable. If the total quota cannot be increased, the city's car oil allocation will inevitably be reduced. As for the reduction method, we have also requested instructions from the central government. In order to avoid a repeat of the panic buying, the authorities are studying effective countermeasures: (1) Request the Central Bank to allow the city's gasoline to be settled once a month. If this method is approved by the central government, the price of gasoline can be prevented from being adjusted as before. (2) Mandatorily stipulate gas stations for car owners based on their occupation or location, dispersing the congestion at major gas stations. (This method has many difficulties and is difficult to implement.)</p>
<h3>Han Neipo Accused of Assaulting Referee, Only Plaintiff Appears in Court</h3>
<p>[Report from this Newspaper] The district attorney's office held a court hearing yesterday on the case of Han Neipo of the Donghua Football Team assaulting a referee. Only the plaintiff, Jiang Yinseng, appeared in court. Han Neipo went to Hong Kong and another referee, Shen Huichun, did not appear in court. The hearing was adjourned to another date.</p>
<h3>Weng Zhong's Relocation: No Problem, MGM Expresses Willingness to Give Away for Free</h3>
<p>[Report from this Newspaper] The issue of relocating the stone Weng Zhong statue next to the racecourse has rarely been raised since it was found that the land belonged to the MGM Film Company, and the pious men and women who go to burn incense and worship have returned to their old ways. In fact, if the municipal authorities can not shirk their responsibility, the relocation of the two stone Weng Zhong statues is not a problem. The MGM side is willing to "donate" them for free. MGM's Shanghai manager specifically told this newspaper reporter yesterday: If a committee or something is established that does not aim at wealth but relocates the stone Weng Zhong statues to other places where the public can continue to worship them, the company authorities absolutely agree and are willing to "donate" the two statues unconditionally. In short, the MGM company's attitude is no different to the relocation of the stone Weng Zhong statues, but I hope that the company authorities will not be troubled by this.</p>
<h3>Eleven Substandard Milk Farms Punished</h3>
<p>[Report from this Newspaper] According to statistics from the Health Bureau, there are more than 60 milk farms in the city, with more than 3,000 dairy cows, producing about 40,000 pounds of fresh milk per day.

<h3>Transfer of Renting Rights and Top Fees to Be Handled by the Court</h3>
<p>[Report from this Newspaper] The Land Administration Bureau previously received a tip from a citizen that Chu Ruifeng, the second landlord at No. 5, Lane 243, Xiamen Road, accepted a top fee of 620 million yuan from Wang Zongqie and transferred the house to Wang Zongdan for occupancy. Director Zhu immediately ordered staff to investigate. According to Yu and Wang, 550 million yuan was for decoration and painting, so it can be inferred that the remaining 70 million yuan must be the top fee. Director Zhu has often received tips regarding top fees for renting a house, but there has been no evidence. Now that Yu and Wang have admitted to receiving the top fee, according to Articles 6, 8, and 18 of the Housing Rental Regulations, a fine of up to three times the top fee should be imposed. The case was transferred to the court yesterday for handling.</p>
<h3>Lu Gang Admits to Being Confused in Preliminary Hearing</h3>
<p>[Report from this Newspaper] The case of Lu Gang, a teacher at Qifeng Elementary School (now renamed Liugeng Elementary School) in Nanshi, repeatedly raping young female students, was heard yesterday morning in the Criminal Division 8 of the District Court by Judge Xie Zhiying in a preliminary hearing. Of the victims who were summoned, only Jiang Zhang and her daughter appeared in court. In addition, the school janitor Feng Jinzhao and Lu's wife Jiang Ximei appeared in court to testify. Lu Gang wore a white shirt, khaki pants, and round glasses, and his attitude was calm and composed. He stated: 26 years old, graduated from Guanqun Junior High School, and after a year of rest, he joined Qifeng Elementary School as a teacher. He denied rape, saying that only two female students were manipulated by him. He admitted that it was just a moment of confusion. The court then continued to question the victims and witnesses. Fearing that the victims were young and psychologically frightened, and that it would be detrimental to public morals, it was ordered to prohibit spectators from attending. Finally, it was ordered to change the date for another closed-door hearing, and the defendant was returned to custody.</p>

Unexpectedly, the prisoners were unusually stubborn, so the General Bureau was requested to send two flying fortresses to suppress them along the way.</p>

<h3>City Government Reiterates Attitude Towards Jiaotong University</h3>
<p>[Report from this Newspaper] Regarding the Jiao Tong University Student Union's inquiries that have not yet been answered and the plan to convene a public arbitration meeting on its own, the city government specifically stated its attitude yesterday, saying: Jiao Tong University has not yet answered Mayor Wu's eight inquiries, which is tantamount to tacitly acknowledging that a small number of professional students are manipulating the situation. Before Jiao Tong University publicly answers, any activities of the school's Student Union are still likely to be manipulated by a small number of professional students. If the specific facts can be answered to Mayor Wu, there is no need for summons or arbitration. Moreover, the arbitration comes from Jiao Tong University, and the mayor will not pay attention to it or bury it. If the extended deadline expires, a public summons will be made in accordance with the law.</p>
<h3>The Municipal Council Receives Two Urgent Motions: Abolishing the Cotton Yarn and Cloth Control Policy to Earn Foreign Exchange; Requesting the Central Government to Negotiate the Cessation of Hong Kong Exchange Transactions</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The Municipal Council yesterday received two temporary urgent motions, which will be submitted to the plenary session for discussion.</p>
<p>One was a proposal by Rong Hongyuan, Ma Junshuo, Liu Jingji, Zhu Fuqiu, Wang Wei, and others, with the joint signature of Xu Jilao and 31 others, requesting the government to abolish the cotton yarn and cloth control policy and open up yarn and cloth exports in order to earn foreign exchange and purchase raw cotton equipment to maintain production. The main points of the proposal's rationale stated: At the beginning of the establishment of the Yarn and Cloth Control Committee, the main purpose was to purchase and sell cotton and yarn on behalf of textile mills. However, in reality, only the unified purchase of cotton was implemented first, causing the factories to be unable to purchase on their own, resulting in a daily depletion of cotton reserves, and recently causing a disconnection phenomenon where the selling price of finished products is far lower than the cost. Although the authorities are now granting purchase certificates to the factories, the opportunity has been lost and the remedy is too late. In the future, the suspension of work is worrying. Therefore, it is difficult to save the crisis unless the government is requested to re-establish the entire production plan. The only way to remedy the cotton shortage is to open up yarn and cloth exports, earn foreign exchange, and exchange it for foreign cotton and production equipment so as to circulate and continue production. Method: It is proposed that the conference approve and forward it to the relevant departments of the central government for prompt adoption in order to save the textile industry crisis, consolidate the foundation of the country, and maintain the livelihood of the people. The second motion was a telegram from Wang Naixu requesting the central government to promptly negotiate with the Hong Kong government through diplomatic channels to stop Hong Kong exchange transactions, and to request that it deny that Hong Kong dollars outside the territory have the same value as those within the territory, so as to alleviate my country's economic crisis.</p>
<p>Seven Subcommittee Committees Spend All Day Reviewing Proposals</p>
<p>The Sixth Municipal Council Congress was still convened all day yesterday for various group review meetings. In the morning, there were three groups: land administration, budget and final accounts, and individual regulations. In the afternoon, there were committees on health, autonomous regulations, human rights protection, and administrative reports. The discussion process was mostly simpler than the previous groups. They finished their discussions at about 5 p.m.</p>
<p>Land Administration Section</p>
<p>Important proposals included: (1) It is proposed to organize a housing construction committee, investigate public and private vacant land in various districts of the city, and formulate an entire plan to build houses for rent or sale, so as to solve the current housing shortage. Review opinion: This case, together with the attached case, should be sent to the municipal government to instruct the land administration bureau to immediately follow the resolutions of the Fifth General Assembly of this council and actively handle it with reference. (2) It is proposed that the municipal government and the central government's affiliated agencies strictly prohibit the topping of houses with huge tips, which will fuel the trend of topping houses and disrupt social order. Review opinion: Send it to the municipal government for submission to the central government, and order them to pay attention. (3) Please ask the municipal government to thoroughly investigate the public land and houses in the former French Concession that have not been handed over, and promptly recover them to maintain public property. Review opinion: Write to the municipal government to negotiate strictly and resolve it as soon as possible. If the other party delays again, immediately send personnel to take over and submit it to the General Assembly for approval.</p>
<p>Budget and Final Accounts Section</p>
<p>Important cases included: (1) The city's budget should be suspended by various agencies to save on expanding business expenses in order to promote municipal administration. Review opinion: It is proposed that the General Assembly pass it and send it to the municipal government for consideration and reply. (2) It is proposed to increase the office expenses of the district people's representative conferences in various districts and the meal expenses for the attendance of the district people's representatives. Please vote on the case. Review opinion: It is proposed that the General Assembly send it to the municipal government to consider increasing it. The remaining cases were all approvals to add or reduce the successive annual expenditure budgets sent by the municipal government.</p>
<p>Regulations Section</p>
<p>Passed a suggestion to the General Assembly to pass all cases as they were. (1) It is recommended that the Executive Yuan widen the base number in each region where the cost of living index is stipulated by region and formulate a unified method to show uniformity. (2) Submit a serious protest to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs against the Siamese government's destruction of overseas Chinese education. (3) Severely punish the Japanese fishing boats and crew seized this time in order to uphold international law. (4) Launch a movement to resist the Soviet Union and help the bandits to foment chaos, expose the CCP's secret treaty to sell out the country, and demand the recovery of Lushun and Dalian.</p>
<p>Health Section</p>
<p>Important cases passed included: (1) Please build a complete public toilet near the North Railway Station to benefit passengers and emphasize hygiene. (2) Please pay attention to the hygiene of Nanshi, clean up the streets, and ban private and strict toilets to improve the appearance of the city. (3) In order to prevent epidemics, it is proposed to strengthen hygiene work. (4) Please relocate the corpse examination office on Changde Road in order to emphasize hygiene and avoid affecting children's psychology.</p>
<p>Effectively Stop Illegal Arrests</p>
<p>After discussion, the Human Rights Protection Committee decided to recommend to the General Assembly that military and police agencies effectively stop illegal arrests and abuse of non-criminal punishment, otherwise, please impose severe sanctions.</p>
<p>After discussion, the Administrative Report Review Committee appointed drafters of the review opinions of various departments of the administrative report and then adjourned.</p>
<p>The Autonomous Law Draft Research Committee decided after discussion: (1) First study and criticize the four draft laws proposed by the Ministry of the Interior as a written opinion and recommend them to the Legislative Yuan for adoption. (2) After pushing Yixing to draft the written opinion, convene a meeting to pass it and send it to the Legislative Yuan for deliberation. (3) It is proposed to suggest to the Legislative Yuan that the Hangzhou Municipal Council's official letter respect and expand the functions and powers of public opinion organs.

<h3>Rice Prices Soar: White粳 Rice Reaches a High Price of 16 Million Yuan</h3>

<h3>Floating Capital Pours into the Market: Most of the Chinese Stocks Hit the Daily Limit; Government Bonds Tend to Rise; Foreign Stocks Are Enthusiastically Bought</h3>

Yong yarn finally hit the daily limit, and there was even a premium. All remaining stocks except Datong hit the daily limit.</p>
<p>When the market opened in the morning, people's hearts were unusually excited. Yong yarn appeared on the market at a price of 4,520 yuan and was sold to 4,500 yuan and 4,620 yuan one after another. The stimulation from outside the industry was strong, but the handling fee was opened high at 55 yuan and 60 yuan, and it had to be borne for two days. Although it rose, it mostly returned. After several seesaws, it finally rose to a new peak of 4,740 yuan due to the sharp rise in the spot price and the reduction of Hong Kong telegrams to one and a half cents. The cloth market was crazy and was suspended from trading. After the yarn and cloth rose, there was a return, and it fell to 4,630 yuan. However, Wuhe Hengfeng stood firm and hit the limit, and people's hearts were still excited. Guangbang and others were still paying. The noon closed at 4,700 yuan. Except for Wuhe hitting the limit, matches and Hengfeng hitting the limit and then returning, and Guohuo rising slightly, the rest rose by half a percent to one percent.</p>
<p>In the later market, the stimulation from outside the industry intensified, and it rose step by step. Until the time of closing, all stocks except Datong hit the daily limit. Yong yarn's dark market even added 70 to 80 yuan. Compared with the morning closing, except for Datong, which rose by 10%, the rest all hit the daily limit. Unlisted stocks outside the market all rose by about half a percent.</p>

Compared with the previous closing, all popular stocks rose by 30% to 40% in unison.</p>
<h3>Cotton Yarn Warehouse Receipts: The Deadline for Prompt Delivery; Otherwise, Report to the Government for Price Acquisition</h3>
<p>In recent times, cotton yarn has soared, and the market is full of speculation. Today (25th), after the opening of each yarn, it continued to rise sharply without limit. In view of this, the Yarn Control Committee has now set the following three measures:</p>
<p>(1) Recently, it has been found that more than 30 yarn merchants colluded with intermediaries to profit from 21-count double-horse in the market, speculating and manipulating, and raising yarn prices. The government authorities are thoroughly investigating and severely punishing them. In the future, when supervisory personnel inquire about the store numbers, addresses, and names of the persons in charge of both the buying and selling parties, the intermediaries should explain them at the time and must not be vague, otherwise they will be severely punished for speculating and raising prices.</p>
<p>(2) The transaction warehouse receipts submitted by the intermediaries as usual must not be missing. The addresses of both the buying and selling parties must be added and stamped by the pure guild. If there is any violation of the report, in addition to canceling the intermediary's qualifications, it will also be dealt with according to law.</p>
<p>(3) Recently, it has been found that the warehouse receipts of each yarn factory have been circulating in the market for a long time, which has fueled speculation. All are limited to prompt delivery, otherwise they will be reported to the government for price acquisition, or punished in accordance with the methods for cracking down on hoarding daily necessities during extraordinary times.</p>

The opening price was 120 million yuan higher than the morning closing price, and the closing price was even higher at 1.2 billion yuan.</p>
<p>The rise in factory silk yesterday was not as great as that of artificial silk, because the China Trust Bureau allocated a total of 300 dan to silk weaving factories in this city and other cities, with a price of 952 million yuan, calculated at a 95% discount, with the payment due on the 7th of next month, so the market situation was slightly weak at the end. In the morning, there was a transaction of 1005 million yuan for high zero dan. In the afternoon, the opening price was 1.15 billion yuan. The final asking price was 1.2 billion yuan. The highest price for D-grade was 1.3 billion yuan.</p>

For the rest of the goods, the factory inventory in the afternoon was mostly not opened.</p>
<h3>The Tea Market Is Initially Stable and Then Rises</h3>
<p>The tea market yesterday continued to show a situation of initial stability and then rising. A part of the industry felt that the bottom of June was approaching, and they were forced to worry about their positions, and the situation lacked change. And in the midst of the unprecedented surge in all commodities, they were forced to feel prosperous, and the main force suddenly rose to lift the price. The closing price repeatedly reached new highs. As for transactions, except for export tea, which was still inquired about by exporters, other domestic sales of various patterns were also inquired about by the local and rural merchants, and the process was active.</p>
<h3>Buyers Do Not Hesitate to Pay High Prices to Enter: The Yarn Market Rises Sharply and Cloth Prices Soar; The Cotton Cloth Market Suspends Trading in the Later Market</h3>
<p>In the cotton yarn market yesterday, people were unanimously optimistic, and they bought as soon as they saw goods. Large households led the way, and scattered households followed. The market was full of buying voices, and the supply households were lacking. The market atmosphere was boiling, and the shouting prices were chaotic.</p>
<p>42-count Lanfeng fine yarn soared by more than 150 million yuan at the opening. Since then, the market has risen step by step as buyers do not hesitate to pay high prices and enter indiscriminately. The highest price once hit the 900 million mark. Later, due to the announcement by the Yarn Control Committee to crack down on speculative trading of warehouse receipts, people's hearts turned false, and the general floating profits were sold. The market finally ended at 870 million yuan, which was an increase of 205 million yuan compared with the previous day. The prices of other groups of fine yarn also soared significantly.</p>
<p>In the cotton cloth market yesterday, buyers flocked in, the market atmosphere was crazy, and the market price soared. 12-pound Longtou fine cloth soared by 3.7 million yuan at the beginning. Since then, new buyers have been active, and the absorption of the same industry has also been healthy. The buying atmosphere in the market has become more intense. In an instant, it broke through the 20 million mark and rose to 20.57 million, with many transactions. Until about 10:30, the authorities and the Hua Control Committee announced in the market that the trading of Longtou fine cloth and Sijunzi Yuan Bijin would be suspended to wait for China Textile to open for sale and the supply to return to normal before trading again. As a result, trading was suspended in the later market. It was found that the market price of each cloth had soared by 20% to 30% compared with the previous day.</p>

<h3>Sixty of Our International Students Receive Funding from the British Council</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, London, 24th] According to the British Council, there are currently 60 Chinese students studying in the UK on scholarships from the Council. Among them are 6 professors who have gone to the UK to give lectures and 7 students from Hong Kong. Most of the international students have been approved for a second year of scholarships. Some have graduated and returned to their country. Four of them have transferred to the United States for further studies. All four are studying medicine.</p>
<h3>Self-funded Students Studying in the United States Oppose the New Exchange Settlement Method</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Since the government stipulated that international students would change to exchange settlement at the listed price, the second batch of self-funded international students in the United States were panicked. They believed that if exchange settlement was made at the listed price, 900 US dollars would require as much as 450 million legal currency, which students could not afford. Zhao Yi, chairman of the National Second Self-funded Students Association, urgently telegraphed the Executive Yuan's Ministry of Education, requesting to maintain the official price in order to complete their studies, and went to Washington to petition Ambassador Gu. Dr. Ruthven, President of the University of Michigan, and Dr. Gale, Supervisor of International Students, expressed their sympathy for the students' situation and also telegraphed our country's Finance Minister Wang Yunwu, expressing the same. More than 60 self-funded students from the school have established a student association and elected Zhu Zhitai and Jiang Luyu as the persons in charge to actively contact students from other schools to plan for progress. The reasons held by the self-funded students: (1) The Ministry of Education's examination and recruitment of the second batch of self-funded international students at an exchange rate of 12,000 yuan was officially replied to the Legislative Yuan by the Executive Yuan, and there is a record to be based on. (2) When the self-funded students went abroad, the foreign affairs authorities negotiated with the US side to guarantee that there would be no foreign exchange problems for the self-funded students. The US consulate only allowed visas of 900 yuan. This change in foreign exchange not only increased the burden on the students, but also caused the foreign affairs authorities to lose credibility with the US side. (3) The newly set price is 40 times higher than the official price, and self-funded students are really unable to raise the huge amount of 450 million yuan. (4) The government re-declares that the study period is two years. Self-funded students go abroad at different times, some with three exchange settlements and some with one exchange settlement. Making sudden changes is unfair.</p>

<p>After a three-day break, the World Games basketball team has recovered its energy, and the injuries of Wen Huaizhong's strong hands and feet have also healed. It has been decided to line up with Huang Tianxi and Lao Bao as guards, and Wu Chenjun and Gan Ruizhang as forwards. With such a neat combination, an exciting and skillful performance can be expected.</p>
<p>The Police Star team is the essence of the Renyu and Chenyou teams. It represented the police in the 7th National Games and won fourth place. It has outstanding records, and its generals such as Le Jiazhou, Xu Zhongyi, Yao Wenxuan, and Shen Pengju of Renyu, and Wang Bowen, Wang Rongsheng, and He Zeng of Chenyou are all first-class players in Shanghai. There will be a fierce battle between the World Games team and the Police Star team.</p>

<h3>Joe Louis-Walcott Boxing Match Postponed Again for One Day</h3>
<p>[United Press New York, 24th dispatch] The Joe Louis-Walcott heavyweight boxing championship, scheduled for the 24th, was postponed again to the evening of the 25th due to rain. It rained less than three hours before the match, preventing the fight from being held at Yankee Stadium. At that time, 50,000 spectators were waiting to see Joe Louis's 25th attempt to retain his heavyweight boxing championship. The general expectation is still that Joe Louis has an 11 to 5 chance of winning. Mr. Joe is currently resting at his friend's place, while Walcott is still staying in a hotel in the downtown area, waiting for his second chance to defeat Joe Louis, the "ever-victorious" champion. Mr. Walcott is 34 years old and has six children, and Joe Louis is also 34 years old.</p>

<h3>A Single Flower</h3>
<p>— Zhang Zhenglang</p>
<p>Tang Yuan Zhen Yuan's Changqing Collection, Volume 10, A Response to Hanlin Bai Xueshi's Letter:</p>
<p>All the names are written in ink, the time is spent listening to stories. There is a note below that says:</p>
<p>Letian often travels with me, and always writes his name on the walls of houses. Also, when at the Xin Chang residence, he told a "Single Flower" story, and from Yin to Si, the words were not finished. (According to the Ming Jiajing Dongwu Shi engraved edition of Yuan's Changqing Collection and the Wan Chan Songjiang Ma Shi engraved edition, this industry is missing, and this note is incomplete. Qian Qianyi, Lu Wenshao, and Zhang Yuanji in modern times have all proofread and supplemented it according to the Song edition, so the currently seen Complete Tang Poems and Sibu Jikan have been supplemented without missing anything.)</p>
<p>According to Xu Song's Tang Two Capitals City Ward Examination (Volume 3), Xin Changli is located on the north side of the road inside the Yanxing Gate in Chang'an. Bai Juyi lived in Xin Changli when he was the Director of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and knew the edicts. This poem by Wei Zhi recalls old travels and cherishes the past. It should be between the years after Wei Zhi was awarded the position of Proofreader with the fourth grade in the Zhongshu province in the eighteenth year of Emperor Dezong's Zhenyuan reign (802) and before he was appointed as Left Advisor in the first year of Emperor Xianzong's Yuanhe reign (806) due to his talent, knowledge, and understanding of the principles of practical application, a period of three or four years. ("Shuohua" is one of the skills of the Song Dynasty's Washa, and its origin can be traced back to Hou Bai of the Sui Dynasty, which I have discussed separately. The "Single Flower" mentioned here should be the earliest of the novels and stories known today.)</p>
<p>"Single Flower" is the story of the "Lady of Wei State," the earliest version of which can be found in the "Taiping Guangji" (Volume 484), titled "The Story of Li Wa," with a note at the end of the chapter stating "From the Collection of Strange Tales." According to the "Collection of Strange Tales," it was compiled by Chen Han, a Director of the Department of Agriculture in the late Tang Dynasty, as seen in the "New Tang Book, Art and Literature Records, Fiction Category." The book was recorded in the "Chao Gongwu Junzhai Reading Records" and "Chen Zhensun Zhizhai Book Record Explanation" of the Song Dynasty, but was later lost. The Ming manuscript of the "Hui Zao Lei Shuo," Volume 26, collected by the Institute of History and Philology of the National Academia Sinica, has the "Collection of Strange Tales," which has been abridged and is incomplete. It is preceded by a title stating "Chen Han, Director of the Department of Agriculture, Compiled." It matches the Tang Records and Book Record Explanation, and is still the original book style. The excerpt of the "Story of the Lady of Wei State" is too brief, less than one-tenth of what is recorded in the "Taiping Guangji," and there is a sentence that says:</p>
<p>Formerly named "Single Flower." Yuan Zhen's Response to Bai Juyi's Letter states that all the names are written in ink, and the time is spent listening to stories. The note says that Letian often traveled with him and often wrote his name on the Guipi (wall), and then told a "Single Flower" story, from Yin to Si. (Note: This text is missing the word "Han," and the notes are mistranslated as "Zhu," and "Bi" is mistranslated as "Gui." Also, the words "Fu Ben" should also be mistranslated, and I dare not speculate.)</p>
<p>This text should be the original note of Chen Han's "Collection of Strange Tales." When Zeng Zao abridged the main text of the "Story of the Lady of Wei State," he also abridged the notes of Chen, so the text is difficult to understand and not very coherent. There is a side proof that this note comes from the "Collection of Strange Tales." According to the end of the "The Story of Xie Xiao'e" in the same book, there is also a note that says:</p>
<p>The strange stories recorded are slightly different, so both are preserved.</p>
<p>Although the "Story of Xie Xiao'e" has been abridged here, it can be determined that the original text was written by Li Gongzuo by comparing it with Li Gongzuo's "The Story of Xie Xiao'e" in the "Taiping Guangji" (Volume 491). The "Monk Miaoji" article in Li Fuyan's "Continuation of Strange Tales Records" (Song edition reprinted in the Sibu Congkan Continued Compilation) also describes the story of Xiao'e with slight differences. Chen Han "therefore preserved both." The current edition of the "Collection of Strange Tales" only preserves Li Gongzuo's text, and does not preserve a single word of what is recorded in the "Continuation of Strange Tales Records." It is known that these notes all came from Chen Han and not from Zeng Zao. The "Taiping Guangji" version of "The Story of Li Wa" begins by saying:</p>
<p>Li Wa, the Lady of Wei State, was a prostitute in Chang'an. Her integrity and behavior were remarkable, and she was praised in Chang'an. Therefore, Bai Xingjian, the Supervising Censor, wrote a biography for her.</p>
<p>These thirty-one characters are not Bai Xingjian's original text, because the year of writing is clearly stated at the end of the biography as the autumn of the eleventh year of Zhenyuan (795). At that time, Xingjian had not yet passed the imperial examination (refer to the original biography in the Old Tang Book). How could he call himself a Supervising Censor? Therefore, it is suspected that this is also Chen Han's text in the "Collection of Strange Tales." The editors of the "Taiping Guangji" did not completely remove it and inadvertently inserted it at the beginning of the main text.</p>
<p>Chen Han was a person of the late Tang Dynasty and not far from the Yuan and Bai era. It is said that the old name of "The Story of the Lady of Wei State" was "Single Flower," which should have been based on something. Bai Xingjian wrote the biography in the eleventh year of Zhenyuan (795), and Yuan and Bai listened to the story of "Single Flower" at the Xin Chang residence seven or eight years later. The biography has more than 3,500 words. The storytellers talked from Yin (3-5 am) to Si (9-11 am) without finishing the story. It can be seen that the technology of storytellers at that time had greatly improved, covering the story with more words beyond the biography. Song Dynasty storytellers often used short stories by others as storytelling materials. From this point of view, it can be known that this trend already existed when Tang people wrote novels.</p>
<p>Zeng Lei Shuo was completed in the sixth year of Shaoxing (1136) and published in Gengshen (1140). It was reprinted in Baoqing Bingxu (1226). "The Ming people deleted many things from the printed edition" (see Tieqin Tongjianlou Book Catalogue, Volume 16). These editions are not available. The Wenjin Pavilion Siku Quanshu edition, Volume 28, has been changed, which is different from the Ming manuscript collected by the Academia Sinica. The "Collection of Strange Tales" is in Volume 28, and Chen Han's title is no longer preserved. The note after "The Story of the Lady of Wei State" only has twelve characters:</p>
<p>Formerly named Single Flower Ben Said Single Flower From Yan</p>
<p>The meaning of the text becomes more incomprehensible. It is suspected that it was not deleted by the Siku Quanshu officials, but the origin of the text is unknown.</p>
<p>"Single Flower" was initially the name of a storytelling script, and gradually became Li Wa's alias. In Luo Ye's newly compiled "Drunk Old Man's Talks," Gui Collection, Volume 1, "Not Breaking Faith," there is an article titled "Li Ya does not betray Zheng Yuanhe." The opening sentences are:</p>
<p>Li Wa was a prostitute in Chang'an, with the alias Ya Xian, formerly named "Single Flower." There was a student named Zheng, with the alias Yuanhe, from Jiangyang, who was taking the imperial examination in Chang'an.</p>
<p>Luo Ye's "Drunk Old Man's Talks" is the only copy collected by the Date Clan's Kanran Pavilion in Japan. It was reprinted and published by Bunkyudo in Tokyo in Showa 15, and Chinese and Japanese scholars have mostly determined it to be a Song engraving. In my opinion, it may be a Yuan engraving and Ming printed edition, but there is no problem that the book was completed at the end of the Song Dynasty. These five words "formerly named Single Flower" obviously come from Chen Han's "Collection of Strange Tales." It is suspected that it was a small note under the title, which was inserted into the first line of the main text during copying or engraving, so it is not very coherent with the context. This situation is exactly similar to the addition of thirty-one characters at the beginning of the "Taiping Guangji" version of "The Story of Li Wa." (Recently, a friend proofread Ma Huan's "Yingyai Shenglan," and the small notes under the titles of each country are also often mixed into the first line of the main text, which is the same example). From then on, it was said that Li Wa's alias was "Single Flower." In the Ming Dynasty, Zhou Xianwang's "Li Yaxian's Flower Wine Qujiang Pond" (Dong's Songfen Studio reprinted Miscellaneous Drama Ten Brocade Book):</p>
<p>Bo Yin is introducing, and Mei Xiang goes up and says: This old woman is Li Mama from Mingke Lane in Chang'an City. She has a biological daughter named Yaxian. The officials in the city saw that she was beautiful and gave her the name "Single Flower."</p>
<p>This statement about why Li Wa is called "Single Flower" cannot be found in the books of people before the Ming Dynasty. It should be Zhou Xianwang's guess, so Shi Junbao's "Li Yaxian's Flower Wine Qujiang Pond" (Yuan Opera Selection B Collection) and Xue Jingun's "Embroidered Yun Record" (Sheyuan Tao's reprinted edition) in the Ming Dynasty do not have this statement.</p>
<p>The story of Li Wa is sad and moving, and "the music ends with elegance," which is in line with the ethical concepts of the Chinese people, and is the biggest reason for its popularity. Among the Tang Dynasty novels that had a great impact on later dramas and novels, in addition to Yuan Zhen's "Yingying Biography," this article should be the most important. Apart from what Jin Shengtan called "Continuation of the Western Chamber," the story of Yingying has not changed much. The story of Li Wa has many anecdotes in the Song Dynasty. Yuan Sui has the "Li Wa Travel," and Xu Yanzhou's Poetry Talks once quoted the two sentences "The hairpin is high and majestic by a foot, standing in front of the door to watch the spring breeze," but the full text is no longer available. I once saw in the Yongle Encyclopedia, the "Lang" rhyme, there is an entry for "Lost Strategy Lang," quoting Zhang Junfang's "Li Qing Collection" about Zheng Sheng and Li Wa's affairs. Unfortunately, there are only a few words, and the details are not available. I remember that someone in the Northern Song Dynasty's notes had already mentioned "Zheng Yuanhe," but I cannot remember the name of the book in a hurry. Therefore, the evolution of this story will not be discussed for the time being. In the Ming Dynasty, Chao Huan's (a person from the Jiajing period) "Bao Wen Tang Classified Book Catalogue, Miscellaneous Category," there is "The Record of Li Yaxian," mixed with word talks and novels, which should be the abbreviation of "Zheng Yuanhe's Prostitution Encounter with Li Yaxian" in the seventh volume of Yu Gongren's (a person from the Chongzhen period) published "Dang Ju Notes." This record is in the popular novel style, stating that Zheng Sheng's name is Ping, alias Yuanhe, and his father's name is Xian, alias Jucai. The record can broaden knowledge. The ending says:</p>
<p>Although it is a new story from the brothel, it is compiled into a valley where the secluded produces spring.</p>
<p>It is also appended with a seven-line quatrain and a seven-line律詩, which is purely in the tone of "storytelling," but it is vulgar and unbearable. The events are full of errors, and the interest is extremely low. It seems that it has been popular among storytellers for a long time, so it has gradually lost its authenticity. Therefore, it is suspected that "telling the story of a single flower" has gradually changed in quality from the Tang Dynasty to the Ming Dynasty, but it has not been lost. It is recorded here for the wise to judge. (37.6.12)</p>
<h3>Zou Hanxun "On the Five Averages" Clarification of Doubts</h3>
<p>— Zhou Zumo</p>
<p>As in Zonghuan's Record of Siddham Forest, sounds of the Middle Heaven (seen in Japanese An'nen's Siddham Collection), this type is referred to as throat sounds; while in Zhiguang's Record of Siddham Characters, sounds of the Southern Heaven (seen in this book), they are referred to as dental sounds. The five-sound method in the final section of Guangyun is a blend of these two schools, hence the existence of both throat sounds and dental sounds. As for using the "he" character of the Xia mother as a throat sound, and the "xing" character of the Xia mother as a dental sound, this is because the eighth sound h in Siddham supersounds is a fricative in the throat, similar to the Xiao and Xia mothers. Panini once said this was of the same category as k, so scholars of Sanskrit transmission equated it with Jian and Xi. In terms of phonetics, the Sanskrit k, k, called jihvamuliya by Patatigakhyas, is a tongue-root sound, not a sound from the throat (Kantha) as Panini believed. The Sanskrit h is a throat sound, but Panini incorrectly grouped it with k (see Whithey's Sanskrit Grammar). In Chinese, Jian and Xi are equivalent to Sanskrit k, k, while Xiao and Li resemble Sanskrit h. Thus, the Tang people's alphabet considered Jian and Xi as dental sounds, and Xiao and Li as throat sounds (see Dunhuang Duosuo 100). Today, books discussing Siddham, such as the Siddham Chapter of the Nirvana Sutra, Record of Siddham Characters, and Jingyou Tianzhu Ziyuan, all name the five sounds as dental, lingual, labial, guttural, and labial. Therefore, the existence of both dental and guttural names for the five sounds has a basis, named according to the Siddham art, although the examples given may not fully correspond to Siddham. Mr. Zou, misunderstanding the meaning of dental sounds and the reason for the combination of dental and guttural sounds, makes purely speculative statements that must be refuted.</p>
<p>In essence, although Mr. Zou's book is lengthy in argument, it lacks substantial insight and cannot compare to the works of Jiang and Chen. Because it may mislead the future, I openly criticize it, not daring to denigrate previous scholars." (To be continued)</p>
<h3>Jottings with a Writing Brush</h3>
<p>— Tang Lan</p>
<p>The Tiger Tally of New Xi in Xinqi, formerly in the collection of the Luo family in Shangyu, is inlaid with gold characters in four lines, the text being:</p>
<p>The tally of armor and weapons, the right half with the King, the left half with the New Xi Commandant. Whenever dealing with soldiers, deploying armored troops, fifty men or more, the King's tally must be matched before action. In case of emergency, action can be taken even without matching the tally. The characters are in small seal script, very exquisite.</p>
<p>Mr. Wang Jingan once wrote a postscript to the Qin New Xi Tiger Tally, citing Wei Zhao's persuasion of King Wei by Su Qin: "Your Majesty's country has Xu, Yan, Kunyang, Wuyang, and New Xi in the south." It is said that New Xi was still Wei territory during the reign of King Wei'an, because New Xi was east of Wuyang, separated by the Chu state's Chen city. At that time, the Chu capital was in Chen, and it wasn't until the 54th year of King Zhao of Qin that the Chu capital moved to Juyang, and the fifth year of the First Emperor that it moved to Shouchun, that New Xi had the possibility of entering Qin. Therefore, he determined:</p>
<p>This tally must be from the twenty or thirty years before Qin unified the world.</p>
<p>Mr. Wang's research is generally correct. However, I feel that New Xi entering Qin was even later, and it was no longer part of Wei at that time. Because the Records of Qin Shi Huang states:</p>
<p>In the seventeenth year, Neishi Teng attacked Han, captured King An of Han, and annexed all its territory, establishing a commandery named Yingchuan.</p>
<p>The Table of the Six States states under the seventeenth year of the First Emperor:</p>
<p>Neishi Sheng attacked and captured King An of Han, seizing all his territory and establishing the Yingchuan Commandery. New Xi belongs to the Runan Commandery in the Geography of the Han Shu. Runan Commandery was newly established by Emperor Gaozu of Han and originally belonged to the Yingchuan and Nanyang Commanderies of the Qin Dynasty. The large authority of New Xi was divided from Yingchuan. Furthermore, the "Xu," "Yan" (recorded as "Yanqing" in the Geography), "Kunyang," and "Wuyang" four counties mentioned in the Wei Strategy, are all located in the Yingchuan Commandery, which serves as clear evidence. Therefore, these places were obtained by Qin from Han and were no longer the land of Wei.</p>
<p>The establishment of Yingchuan Commandery in the 17th year of the First Emperor was 230 BC. Nine years later, he unified the world and became emperor (the 26th year of the First Emperor, 221 BC). However, here it is still referred to as "King," indicating that it was before he claimed the title of emperor (the Yangling Tiger Tally states "the right half is with the Emperor"), which means it could only have been made within these nine years. Therefore, I suspect it was made at the time of the establishment of Yingchuan Commandery. Therefore, we can say more precisely that this tiger tally was made after the 17th year of the First Emperor, with a difference of no more than a year or two at the latest.</p>
<p>At that time, Li Si had already been in power for a long time, and he was the originator of the small seal script, so it is no wonder that the seal script on this tally is so exquisite.</p>
<h3>Reading Ma Yuancai's Outline of Qin History</h3>
<p>— Ji Xianlin</p>
<p>I myself have no comprehensive understanding of Qin history. Hearing that Mr. Ma is an expert in the study of Qin history, I borrowed his great work, Outline of Qin History, from the library, preparing to read it carefully. However, before I even reached the main text, only reaching the second page of his preface, I saw the following words:</p>
<p>"Moreover, I have been moved by it! The way of reading history is truly difficult to express. My study of Qin history is based primarily on the Records of the Grand Historian. The Records of the Grand Historian is a book that I learned from a young age. Counting from the year I started studying Qin history until now, it has been twelve years. I have delved into the Records of the Grand Historian no less than a hundred million times. However, after more than ten years, in the autumn of the thirtieth year, I realized that the "budebu ci" (forbidden from sacrificing) of "budebu" was "futu" (Buddha). After another two years, in the spring of this year (the 33rd year of the Republic of China—Xianlin note), I realized that "Xianmen" was "Shamen" (monk), and "Anqi" was "Aqiini." (All are seen in the second volume of this book and my humble work, A Study of the Popularization of Buddhism in China during the Qin Dynasty—author's original note)."</p>
<p>Without needing to read the entire book, just these few short sentences, I feel, require discussion.</p>
<p>The second volume of Mr. Ma's Outline of Qin History and A Study of the Popularization of Buddhism in China during the Qin Dynasty do not seem to have been published yet, at least I have not seen them. I don't know what the content is; but just looking at the passage in the preface above, one can see that he only discovered that the "budebu" of "budebu ci" is the later "futu" (Buddha) in the autumn of the 30th year of the Republic of China (1941), and from the tone, it seems to be his own original creation, not copied from others. This greatly surprised me. As early as 1927, the Japanese scholar Fujita Toyohachi wrote a paper (Toyo Gakuho, Volume 16, Number 2), arguing that "budebu" was a transliteration of the Sanskrit word Buddha. The response of Chinese and foreign scholars to this article was almost unanimous; they all believed that this theory was untenable. The "budebu" in the original sentence "jin budebu mingxing chu xifang" (forbidden from sacrificing, the stars will not come from the West) is a function word, not a content word. Mr. Tang Xiyu (Yongtong) also discussed this issue in the seventh and eighth chapters of his History of Buddhism in the Han, Wei, Jin, Southern and Northern Dynasties. He also believed that this statement was groundless. However, Mr. Ma, fourteen years after the publication of Fujita's paper, ten years after he started studying Qin history, suddenly discovered that "budebu" was "futu." In his great work, A Study of the Popularization of Buddhism in China during the Qin Dynasty, this may be the main argument. What else can we say besides being surprised?</p>
<p>Of course, we cannot expect a scholar to read all the books in the world; this is simply impossible. But he should generally be aware of the books and papers within his research scope. Especially since Fujita's paper has been discussed by many scholars, it seems that a scholar who claims to study Qin history should not be unaware of it. Even if we take a step back and say that if a scholar wants to write a paper proving that Buddhism had already entered China during the Qin Dynasty, he should definitely take a look at Tang's History of Buddhism in the Han, Wei, Jin, Southern and Northern Dynasties. But Mr. Ma is completely unaware of all this. Besides being surprised, we really have nothing else to say.</p>
<p>Let us now discuss the two borrowed foreign words that Mr. Ma discovered twelve years after "starting to study Qin history": "Xianmen" is "Shamen" (monk), and "Anqi" is "Aqiini." We can only see from the records in the Records of the Grand Historian that "Xianmen" is an immortal living in a misty and ethereal place. However, Mr. Ma said that this is an Indian monk. According to the Sanskrit original of "Shamen" is Sramana, and the Pali word Samana. Tang Huilin's Yiqiejing Yin Yi, Volume 18, says: "Shamen, is a corrupted Sanskrit word. The correct Sanskrit pronunciation is Shiramana." (Taisho Tripitaka, Volume 54, page 420, upper) According to our current research, "Shamen" is not "corrupted" because it was not directly translated from Sanskrit, but went through a medium. In Tocharian A (Agnian language), Sanskrit Sramana becomes Samam, and in Tocharian B (Kuchean language) it becomes Samane. The Chinese "Shamen" was translated from Tocharian. Since Mr. Ma argues that "Xianmen" is "Shamen," does he know that the source of "Shamen" has undergone so many twists and turns? Is he able to prove that "Xianmen" was also translated into Chinese through the medium of Tocharian? At the very least, he should be able to prove that "Xianmen" was translated from ancient Indian vernacular (Prakrit), because Sanskrit Sramana would never be translated as "Xianmen." I am afraid Mr. Ma cannot do any of these things. However, he himself believes that this is no longer a problem. In his Qin history, he has already established an independent biography for "Xianmen."</p>
<p>As for "Agni", the original Sanskrit word is Agni, which is the god of fire and was highly revered in ancient India. There are many songs in the Rigveda that praise the god of fire. The Chinese translation "Ajiini" is equivalent to the Sanskrit pronunciation; but "Anqi" has a problem. According to Bernhard Karlgren's reconstruction, the pronunciation of the character (An) is:</p>
<p>an/an/an (Grammata Serica, 146)</p>
<p>The pronunciation of the character (Qi) is:</p>
<p>kjag/kji/ki (Grammata Serica 952)</p>
<p>Can Mr. Ma prove why the Sanskrit Agni changed its pronunciation when it came to China? In addition to the difficulties in pronunciation, we also do not understand why the Indian god of fire ran to China and became an immortal. We also hope that Mr. Ma can explain it to us.</p>
<p>My criticism of Mr. Ma's words in the preface to his great work ends here. Some may think that I am making a mountain out of a molehill. Mr. Ma Guangsheng only wrote a few words, but I have written a long article. However, I feel that Mr. Ma's few words represent a very popular, very fashionable, and very absurd trend in the current Chinese academic world, and we should stand up and correct it. There are many so-called scholars who have no comprehensive understanding of ancient Central Asian languages, but they prefer to talk about transliteration. They don't even have the most basic common sense, they don't even know the simplest methods, all they have is a pitiful bit of fantasy, and they use this fantasy to study problems. As long as they are happy, they can put any Chinese character together with any foreign character and say that this Chinese character is a transliteration of this foreign character. They are like children playing with building blocks, able to separate the letters of foreign words one by one, and then rearrange them one by one. The order is not important to them at all. This approach really makes us laugh and cry. We can simply say that this is an academic evil. Recently, many scholars have written such articles. Before reading these articles, I did not believe that there could be such absurd things in the world. After reading them, I realized that I was still a frog in a well. An old scholar in Nanjing is particularly diligent in this regard and has written many such articles. The most wonderful thing is that he also has an article saying that "budebu" is "futu", published in "Truth" (this was told to me by Mr. Zhang Yuanfeng), which can be said to be a rare coincidence.</p>
<p>I have written a long article, not out of disrespect for Mr. Ma, but simply using the topic to expand on the discussion, hoping that scholars will be particularly careful when studying transliteration. Mr. Ma's book may still have valuable aspects. I am an amateur and will only discuss that section of his preface here, and will not discuss the rest.</p>

<h3>Idol Worship</h3>
<p>— Qian Wen</p>
<p>The Three Treasures of Buddhism are the Buddha, the Dharma, and the Sangha. If we were to test the public with a quiz, putting in these three terms, I am afraid that not many would be able to give the correct answers. What is Buddha? The common people only say it is Buddha and Bodhisattva. What is Bodhisattva? They will answer that Bodhisattvas are gods. What is Sangha for? Most people probably think they are for chanting scriptures and performing rites for the dead. What is Dharma? Very few people would be able to answer.</p>
<p>Christianity forbids idol worship because a monotheistic religion certainly does not allow the worship of bull-demons, snake-gods, and those kinds of images. Even their Jehovah cannot be represented by any kind of image. As for the image of the Virgin Mary and the image of Jesus on the cross, they are all memorials and artistic creations. Buddhism uses images for teaching. Although there are quite a few Buddha images, Bodhisattva images, and Arhat images, whether they are clay sculptures, wood carvings, stone carvings, or written paintings, they are all the remaining images of the sages of the Indian school. Although they may not be real, believers have more or less added their own imaginations to create them. For example, Guanshiyin has gradually become feminine in our country. These images all show compassion and solemnity, but they are consistent. Those who truly understand the Dharma will never confuse "seeking gods" with "worshipping the Buddha."</p>
<p>There was once a high monk who used wooden Buddha images as firewood. When asked what he was doing, he said he wanted to burn out the relics. The questioner said, "How can there be relics in wood?" He said, "Since there are none, it is just a piece of wood. What harm is there in burning it?" Taking idols as gods, Buddha images as a kind of god that can fulfill any request, and stone statues of ancient people as Buddhas and Bodhisattvas, this proves that the level of national knowledge is low, which is shocking and painful.</p>
<p>Zhang Taiyan said, "Buddhist scriptures do not worship ghosts and gods. Their own sect is based on stillness, wisdom, and profound arguments, thinking deeply into the question of non-existence. Because it was located in India, it was mixed with strange and absurd talk, which high talents in China did not pay attention to." It is not necessary to discuss that a high talent does not believe in mythology, but it is a pity that after Buddhism entered China, few people knew about the profound arguments, but mythology was particularly popular, making ignorant men and women have no other faith except in gods and monsters. This is an education problem, and smashing stone figures to fill the roads is not a fundamental solution. Freedom of belief, but how can we make the people believe what they should believe?</p>
<p>Some people say that Buddhism is declining today, but I think otherwise. What is declining is the custom of going to temples to burn incense, asking for sons and wealth. This shows that fewer people believe in gods and monsters, while high talents are organizing Buddhist societies and studying academic questions. However, high talents are good at thinking for other high talents, but they are unwilling to worry about the many people who are bowing down to idols on the road. Since someone is engaged in re-editing the Tripitaka, why has no one compiled a simple overview of Buddhism so that both opponents and believers can understand the true meaning of the Dharma? Emperor Wu of Liang asked Bodhidharma what merit he had for building temples, writing scriptures, and ordaining monks. Bodhidharma answered that there was no merit. Bodhidharma came to the East to warn the emperor and break his superstition. If Buddhists want to promote the Dharma and dispel the misunderstandings of fools about the Dharma, it is best to tear down the Wenchang Hall and the Hall of the God of Wealth in the ancient Longhua Temple; otherwise, people will think that these two idols who bless people with promotion and wealth are the Buddha and the Bodhisattva.</p>
<h3>The Smallest Bird</h3>
<p>— Mao Yi</p>
<p>The hummingbird is the smallest of birds, weighing no more than one-tenth of an ounce. However, they have extremely high flying speeds, with their wings capable of flapping seventy-five times a second, and they can fly at fifty-five miles per hour. And they are able to fly back and forth a thousand miles! They are able to achieve this feat because they possess unusually strong wing muscles and great ambition.</p>
<p>The entire lifestyle of the hummingbird is fast-paced: quick courtship; quick mating; quick laying of eggs; even nest-building is fast, usually completed in a day. The size of the eggs is like a pea, and when the chicks hatch, they are barely larger than a human fingernail, which is quite amusing.</p>
<p>The hummingbird's tongue is a unique marvel of the "bird world," composed of two tubular organs. How they move the nectar they consume into these two organs is still not understood by humans. In addition to nectar, they also eat small insects that forage in the flowers and are caught in flight.</p>
<p>In terms of selecting flowers, hummingbirds are skilled botanists. They target flowers with trumpet-shaped corollas, as the nectar in these flowers is hidden deep within. Bees are simply unable to compete with hummingbirds in this regard; only a long-tongued butterfly can reach deep into these flowers, but the strong-willed hummingbirds can easily drive away their competitors.</p>
<p>There are many types of hummingbirds, and their names are beautiful, such as: sapphire hummingbird, rainbow hummingbird, fairy hummingbird, emerald hummingbird, etc. In total, there are more than six hundred and fifty species of hummingbirds. Robert Moore of Pasadena, California, has the most extensive collection of hummingbird specimens, with nearly six hundred species, all personally collected by him.</p>
<p>The feathers of the hummingbird are extremely beautiful, and their colors can change under the sun. However, this is not because the hummingbird's feathers have multiple pigments, but because their small barbules are able to refract light like diamonds. Hummingbirds have "prisms of feathers," they are living rainbows, and they use sunlight to adorn themselves with brilliance and preciousness.</p>
<h3>Lu Xun's Book Collection</h3>
<p>— Nian Xin</p>
<p>The collection of books in the Sanxian Shuwu (Three Idlers Studio) is extremely broad in scope and is divided into two locations, Shanghai and Beiping. I have seen the Shanghai part. In addition to books of both Chinese and foreign origin, there are books in Western languages, among which Japanese books are the most numerous, followed by German. Although there are also collections of Russian and English books, they are mostly because the illustrations in the books are exquisite. Lu Xun was indeed very concerned about and loved Chinese and Western art. The "Han Paintings" in his Beiping collection are said to contain many treasures, but unfortunately, he did not have time to compile and organize them before his death. The "Sibu Beiyao" of the Commercial Press is also one of the "major books" in the Sanxian Shuwu. Lu Xun wanted to compile a complete "History of Chinese Literature" in his later years and purchased this book as a reference material, and it is said that he had already prepared a plan. Lu Xun also discussed this matter in letters with friends and lamented that he could not find a good and quiet environment in the country. Although Beiping was an ideal place, certain restrictions made Lu Xun feel "constrained." Therefore, throughout his life, this "History of Chinese Literature," which was anticipated by the literary world, was never completed. (Currently, the most detailed and comprehensive "History of Chinese Literature" in China seems to be the one by Zheng, published by the Beiping Pushe, but it only goes up to the Ming Dynasty and is now out of print.) And some of the volumes of "Sibu Beiyao" have not even been opened.</p>
<p>As for a detailed catalog of the books in the Sanxian Shuwu, Ms. Jing Song may have compiled it? However, it has not been published to the public, which is also of concern to book lovers. However, the Wenhui Daily had previously published Lu Xun's "Diary" daily, in which he would add a note whenever he obtained a book, and readers could see a glimpse of the Sanxian Shuwu's collection from this.</p>
<p>Here, I also recall that during the period of occupation, due to the high cost of living, Lu Xun's family in Beiping had a proposal to sell books. At that time, Ms. Jing Song published a statement in Shanghai opposing it. It is regrettable when the efforts of a literary man are transferred to another. Later, it is unknown whether this proposal was actually implemented, or whether it was abandoned due to the "opposition" from Shanghai. However, when I read Lu Xun's "Leisurely Talks After Illness" (Qiejieting Miscellany, page 220), which mentions Song Duanyi's "Lizhai Xianlu," it says: "I have been keeping this book, until more than ten years ago, because I was so hungry that I sold it and two other Ming manuscripts and a Ming print of 'Gongkai Bidian' to Fu, who is famous as a bibliophile and scholar. He made me run three or four times before saying that he would give me eight yuan in total. I refused to sell in a fit of anger, and took it back and hid it in my residence in Beiping; but no one has taken care of it for a long time, and I don't know what happened to it now." Thus, Lu Xun had also wanted to solve his "hunger" problem by selling books in his early years. The "Fu" mentioned here should be Fu Yuanshu (Zengxiang) from Jiangxiang, who is famous for the inscriptions on his Yizang'an library. However, this book was not originally purchased by Lu Xun himself, but was left by his ancestors. As he said in his article, "My family is not a book collecting family, I really don't understand how there would be this Ming manuscript," which shows its value. Therefore, I would also like to ask: "I don't know what happened to it now?"</p>
<h3>Raindrops</h3>
<p>— Shi Jimi</p>
<p>No one denies that multicolored colors are beautiful, but the colors that have failed are even more unsightly than no color at all.</p>
<p>When you think too much about everything, everything is terrible; therefore, people who think too much are somewhat neurotic.</p>
<p>Dear, if everyone's nose was not as flat as the one you mock, what would be so outstanding about your well-defined and beautiful Greek nose?</p>
<p>Some people think that everything belonging to others is good, and others think that everything belonging to themselves is the best. — They are all equally confused and pitiful insects.</p>
<p>A doctor curses patients in his clinic. Has he forgotten that healthy people don't see doctors?</p>
<p>If you envy someone's basket of fish, quickly cast your own net to the bottom of the river.</p>
<p>There are so many mirrors in the world, why are there so many people who do not know what they really look like?</p>
<h3>Coercion</h3>
<p>— Yi Jun</p>
<p>Sometimes, "coercion" is not the same as "oppression." Those who are "oppressed" only experience suffering, but those who are "coerced" may obtain happiness.</p>
<p>For example, when summer arrives and typhoid and cholera are prevalent, health authorities have a method of compulsory vaccinations. Regardless of whether you are willing to get vaccinated or afraid of the pain, they will give you at least one shot, or else they will make things difficult for you, such as not selling you a train ticket. But coercing you to get vaccinated is for your own happiness and the happiness of all citizens.</p>
<p>Another example: All countries have compulsory education systems. (Last night, as I was writing this, it was twelve o'clock, the main power switch was turned off, the dormitory lights went out, and I was forced to go to bed. I was a little resentful in my heart. But turning off the lights at midnight and forcing me to put down my pen and go to sleep certainly takes my health into consideration.) The duration of compulsory education is four years in China, ten years in England, four to nine years in the United States, and four years in the Soviet Union, and so on. No matter what your future aspirations are, you must first complete the required years of compulsory education. But coercing you to receive education is to give you spiritual sustenance and preserve and promote national culture.</p>
<p>This kind of "coercion" that is not "oppression," this "trouble" for the sake of obtaining "happiness," should be done thoroughly without fear. However, if the person in charge always puts on a stern face, "enforcing" things in a hostile manner, without explaining the reason clearly to people, and still believes that "the people can be made to follow, but not to understand," then it seems close to "oppression."</p>
<p>###</p>
<p>The hustle and bustle of current events is now a spectacle, lacking nothing. At home and abroad, in the literary and military fields, everything is a thrilling show. Try reading every newspaper; the new and strange stories recorded each day are almost overwhelming. In addition to the international political maneuvering and the domestic power struggles, which are considered "important news," there are also many novelistic and interesting stories, such as "Pandas" and "Sister Yang," interspersed throughout, like reading the Classic of Mountains and Seas or opening Records of Gods and Marvels. If "Pu" of Strange Tales from a Chinese Studio and "Ji" of Yuewei Thatched Cottage Notes were alive today, they would surely greatly welcome the endless stream of such strange news. (Now, those in the "film industry" see Sister Yang and the like as something to capitalize on.)</p>
<p>"The people regard food as heaven," this is common knowledge. "Eating and clothing" is also a common saying. Those who are accustomed to wearing clothes may not need them, but they cannot do without food; thus, food is even more closely related to "life." Considering the soaring grain prices in recent years, which are inevitably followed by cries of "cannot survive," historically, even emperors like Duke Huan of Qi and Zhao Wu, despite their noble status, had to climb trees to search for birds for food when they were starving. This shows that regardless of wealth or poverty, high or low status, in China or abroad, in ancient or modern times, no hero can hold a grudge against their own stomach. Therefore, in the play "Selling the Horse," Qin Shubao, exhausted in the inn, suddenly hears the words "Go eat!" and immediately awakens with a startled expression. In the play "Pan Guan," the gatekeeper, standing sideways and nodding off, suddenly hears the words "Eat noodles!" and immediately exclaims "Good salty brine!" with a drooling intent. This depiction of the human need for food is extremely profound, evoking deep empathy.</p>
<p>According to physiology, "the human body is like a furnace." The ability of a furnace to generate heat and perform its function depends on the continuous addition of fuel from above, while the ash is removed from below, forming a metabolism. If only the ash is seen coming out from below, and the fuel is not seen being added from above, then the furnace will inevitably become cold, the fire will go out, like waste, like a rigid stone. Therefore, using the body as a metaphor for a furnace, it is clear that eating and drinking from above is like adding fuel and coal; excretion from below is like removing ash. If people could live without eating, then the many cars in Shanghai would not have to line up early to wait to buy gasoline. (See the newspaper report about the "oil shortage," where car queues experience the hardship of peasants lining up to receive relief grain.) In that case, the fact that Sister Yang "did not eat for nine years but acted as usual" is even more exaggerated than the boastful accounts in Zuo Zhuan about "Lady Xi not speaking for three years!"</p>
<h3>Miscellaneous Poems from Yi Lou</h3>
<p>— Shi Shufan</p>
<p>I am surprised to wake up and see the city change! The price of grain and silk is so high it's like they communicate with gods. Deep sorrow fills the houses along the Huangpu River, the setting sun shines on the flag atop the city walls of Daliang. I pray for heaven's favor to bring about a triple change, but in this anxious state, nothing seems right. I wake up and hear the buzzing of mosquitoes everywhere, how dark is the cold night under these fiery clouds?</p>
<p>Grass grows lush, the buildings are deep, surrounded by pomegranate blossoms like fire, where do all these melancholic thoughts come from? The short trees are sparse, heaven is unpredictable, the scattered stars, the night is sad, the cold breath of war dissolves the bones on the plains, and the liver wind causes red palms and thunder in the hands. Imminent danger weighs down, the pure stream is cheap, and I still hear the word "yes" but talents are limited to Chu.</p>
<p>Seeing Fireflies</p>
<p>Why do they fall with the wind and lean with the dew, startling me? Unsteady, fireflies resemble feelings after chaos, I pity their weakness as they struggle in the grass, the foolish red is helpless until dawn.</p>
<p>The sickle moon cleaves the sky, the white dew is deep, in the dew the fireflies rise and fall, watching the stars, I don't believe the heavens are blind, I gaze at the wandering souls, silently.</p>
<p>Yu Yueyuan has a painting by Wannianshao, a gift to Gu Tinglin entitled "Autumn River Parting Thoughts" I once asked to view it, recalling it with a poem</p>
<p>Friendship of life and death comes from the Buddhist gate, silent face to face is even more sorrowful, where do I know you will go carrying the cloth? Another painting of rivers and mountains is gifted to a deceased friend. (At that time, Wannianshao had already become a Buddhist monk, and Gu also changed his clothes to dress like a cloth merchant.)</p>
<p>The ink flows freely, the brush wants to fly, why do I hear the full page lamenting the crisis? From the beginning, they were laughed at in the same way, meddling too much in the rise and fall are commoners.</p>
