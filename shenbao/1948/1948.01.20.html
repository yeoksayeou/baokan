<h3>英使訪王外長會商　九龍城案漸見轉機　港方二次迫遷令未執行</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十九日電〕首都方面沉靜兩日之中·英談判，十九日已恢復活動，英大使施諦文十一時曾至外部訪王外長，談約一時許，對九龍城問題及穗沙面事件均曾涉及，英使並提出若干材料及意見，但尚未具體化，談判結果不悉。唯雙方態度仍極友善，均有盡力使糾紛不再繼續，而謀迅即解決之誠意。據記者探悉：外部迄晚未獲九龍方而之警報，諒港方原擬於十九日冉度强迫居民遷移之措施並未實行。英倫方而或已有訓示到　港府，故得及時停止此等强制行團。十九日之限期原已爲各方月爲「死錢」，至此方得緩和。外部負責人曾語記者，穗濺各有關方面之報告，仍陸續到部，外部已就各項問題電郭德華特派員有所指示。確息：關於九龍城問題，倫敦及香港兩地談判結果，意見已漸接近，其最終解決之途，將兼顧現實情勢及法律依據，短期內可望有新開展。至穗沙而事件，英大使館仍未接獲英倫政府之指示，迄　明確態度表示。關係方面人士認爲，英大使十九日與王外長之晤談，表示問題解決有更大契機，穗沙面事件並未影響九龍城問題之談判，則九龍城問題之解決，自有裨益於沙面事件之善後，使近月之不安局面重復穩定。　〔中央社南京十九日電〕記者頃自權威方面獲悉：我政府關於香港政府再度强迫九龍城居民遷移一事，曾向英方嚴正提出交涉，英方當不致予以忽視，並聞外交部駐兩席特派員郭德華，已向九龍城居民作必要之曉示。</p>
<p>〔路透社香港十九日電〕九龍城問題迄尙未獲解決，然消息靈通方面對高級方面之願就此事早日成立安協，頗表樂觀。其結果可能對九龍舊城管轄問題暫時維持現狀，留待他日繼續討論，而未來之討論，將不能避免的牽涉整個港九的未來地位。同時九龍舊城區居民仍留居原處未退，留守之警察未予干涉，居民所搭臨時庇身之所，警察亦未加以千涉。至於被判苦役三月之居民代表二人，迄尙未提上訴。</p>
<p>〔本報廣州十九日電〕英軍二五〇名十九日上午四時半突開入九龍城，據聞係準備大舉威迫九龍城居民遷離者，但截至九時止尚無何舉動。居民仍照常升旗，彼等凝視飄揚之國旗，竟至泣下，悲憤可知。又，粵港邊界刻雙方均已派重兵駐守，以防意外。十七日夜曾有不穩份子一帮，企圖自港方進入深圳，但在國軍體密戒備下不逞遁去。英軍突於此時大批增防邊境，情勢至爲緊張。自粵入港者刻均已開始受英軍之嚴密檢查。</p>
<h3>沙面事件嫌疑犯　已釋放七十餘人</h3>
<p>靑年團員阻止救火說不確　〔中央社廣州十九日電〕沙面事件發生時捕獲之嫌疑犯百餘人，其中學生佔三分之一，當晚十六日全部解交警備司令部，該部無拘留所設備，僅禁於優待室中，於十七日晨分別審訊，無罪證者，即時宣布保釋，十七日下午已釋放廿餘人，十八日又放出五十餘人。據悉，隊情節較重大而須加以詳細偵查者外，當以最迅速方法，陸續釋放。</p>
<p>〔又電〕據十七日美聯社電訊稱，沙面事件發生時，有部份穿着制服之三民主義靑年團員，阻止消防隊救火情事。此間前三民主義青年團幹事長，現任省黨部副主委關自恕今談稱：此次九龍城房屋被拆與沙面領館被焚，同為不幸事件，實屬遺憾，尤其此次廣州民衆示咸巡行，因有陰謀份子混入，以至愛國行動為越軌行動，更爲可惜。至報載有穿着制服之靑年團團員阻止消防隊救火一事，殊屬無稽。查青年團團員向無制服之規定，且自黨團統一組織以後，對外已不再用團員名義，更無團員阻止消防隊救火之事。此種電訊，殊與事實不符云。</p>
<h3>總統選舉程序　草案仍竺研討　國大籌委會加緊工作</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十九日電〕國大籌委會工作積極展開，秘書長洪　及經常到處辦公，對國大代表招待所之準備及各代表報到等項需要之文件，均已在籌劃中。頃悉；則經國大壽委會二次會議決交　委會議事組辦理草擬之十餘項　規，現均已完成初稿，俟秘書處處務會議通過交壽委會通過後，即可定稿。又據負古草擬之某以就此十餘種法規之擬訂說明稱：關於主席團選舉辦法草案，議畢規則，國大代表誓書式樣等，均有成例可循，擬訂較易，惟其中關於總統·副總統選舉程序一項，在我國尚乏先例，故經參閱及，夫各民主國家之法典，並微　專家之意見，以完成草案。某以續稱：爲草擾此項章則，前曾助司徒雷登大使，擬借美國法典　參考，殊知各民主國施行已久，均備習慣法，致一時不能獲得良好之參考。某氏並稱：尚待專家硏討後，始可決定。籌會對此　爲重視。</p>
<p>〔又電〕當選國代名單迄未公布之原因，乃國民黨黨員互讓問題及民靑兩黨提名而未獲當選之　紛製解決。蔣主席對此深爲一切，十九日在中央黨部於國父　　週後，曾召見吳鐵城，對此　拆屋　，又民社黨方面對該黨若干黨員不獲當選事，特貝函致國民黨吳鐵城。張厲生。陳立夫，請即召開三黨聯席會議，迅速討論，以便早日解決。　　〔又電〕國民黨中央提名國代聯誼會代表四十人，十九日晨赴中央黨部請　，求見蔣總裁，當由吳秘長接見，謂國代問題尚未作最後決定，正研究辦法。代表請願時，手執白布大旗，上書「謂求執行總裁及中央命令，實施國府決議　。聞該會決定，如中樞不報行其命令及規定，將立即通知各省市會員，於三月十日前齊集南京，出席國大。</p>

<h3>選舉立委　嚴防舞弊</h3>
<p>蘇選所令各區遵行　〔本報鎭江十九日電〕江蘇省選舉事務所兼主委王懋功，以此次開始競選立委，據報有假借名義需索金錢情事發生，常以現屆憲法實施初期，即爲民主進展開始，正氣如果不仲，賢能何能選任，曾奉國民政府迭令嚴加糾正，凡我承辦選務人員，務應隨時嚴切注意，力遏弊萌，俾挽頽風，選政前途實利賴之，該所頃特分飭各區選所轉飭遵照。　〔本報鎭江十九日電〕今距本省新聞界投票選舉立法委員之期僅一日，據各縣報告，在本省競選之陳訓會，程滄波，顯已獲得全省同業一致之支持，其餘如黃少谷，胡健中，陳博生，亦可望獲得相當票數·現鎭·錫各地新聞界競選之陣地，充滿親愛和諧之空氣，堪爲新中國之象微。</p>
<p>〔本報東台十九日電〕立委選舉前夕，此間競選活動白熱化，街頭紅紙標語觸目皆是，呼聲較高者爲朱石秋，喩一凡二氏，又此間記者公會會員一致支持陳訓悉。</p>
<p>〔中央社天津十八日電〕立委選舉即屆，津市各候選人已展開較國大選舉前夕更爲熟烈之競選。各候選人之助選團相繼成立，候選人之畫像及巨型標語，漫畫，傳略，街衢隨處可見，利用汽車作巡迴講演者，亦大有人在。競選者以郭紫峻，王任遠，許運溪，李會林，翟韶華，齊國樑等最爲活躍，民社黨提名候選人周志厚亦於全市遍貼競選標語。　〔中央社西安十九日電〕此間立委競選活動已激烈展開，且已進入白熱階段，各候選人爭取選票之情形，限上次國代選舉時尤爲熱烈，競選標語亦出現街頭。</p>
<h3>國府法制委會　討論自治通則　民選省縣長問題未獲具體結論</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十九日電〕國府委會法制委會，十九日下午四時舉行會議，由孫科主席，討論省縣自治通則，會中共有兩項意見，一部份人認爲目前正在戡亂，軍事動　不安之中國實現省縣長之民選，良非易易，應予緩議，一部份人則認爲，總統旣可選，省縣長自更可選，主此說者以孫科長力，渠認爲民選應即可如期開始。徐傳霖稱：即使不能立即實行，亦得限期完成。張羣則認爲民選事應在縮小省區之後，始可辦理。會中發言極爲熱烈，惟尚未能獲得任何具體結論。</p>
<h3>張嘉璈宴華北請願團　北運糧食將增加　申匯可開放工貸恢復原則無問題</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十九日電〕華北請願團等一行，十九日上午十一時赴國府訪文官長吳譽昌，呈遞向國府之請願書，並就一般事項有所商討，吳氏當允將渠等請求報告主席，並分交各有關機關核議，該團午態張嘉璈宴，對各項問題均曾談及。關於糧食北運數量原則增加，並估計平·津兩地共增爲麵粉一二五萬袋，然此數量尚覺不足，而糧部亦不能立即負担。關於申匯可予開放，以抑低北方日用品之價格。關於恢復工貸，原則無問題，或以定貨方式出之，唯對若干電本·玻璃等小工業，政府無法定貨，尚須另行考盧辦法。押匯可能放長，抵押品或可擴及廠房機器，至渠等與張氏談話佔時最久之外匯問題，以涉及整個政策，朱得結論，僅輸入外匯可能增加，而輸出外匯及利川輸出外匯輸入外糧之辦法，難獲態允，下午四時復遄赴政院謁見張羣院長，張氏原則上允予帮助，但無具體結果，談話並涉及門頭溝煤礦之歸還問題。廿日晨將分訪財部，經部及四聯總處，午後至糧部詳硏南北各地糧食之盈缺，以定勻配辦法。渠等或將列席廿二日之全經會例會有所報告，然並不影響張院長前曾決定之召集各有關部會首長之會商。渠等將於問題大致解決時，再謁主席，俾完成全部工作。</p>
<h3>監院建議國府　注意華北經濟</h3>
<p>〔中央社南京十九日電〕監察院十九日上午九時舉行監委談話會，汪辟疆主席。監委于樹德提議根據華北晋京請願團之申述，以華北軍事緊急，國人莫不關心，而經濟危機尤甚於軍事，反多爲人所忽視，巾央對華北經濟上之措施，多有不合，更促成華北經濟之偏枯，其影響於軍事者，實至重且鉅，一致決定請院派員向主管部會澈查究竟，以憑核辦。並建議國府，對華北經濟措施，令飭各主管部會應參酌該團所陳意見，切實予以改善。</p>
<h3>開放貸款問題　待擬計劇呈全席決定</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十九日電〕權威方面透露，滬工業界吳蘊初等要求開放貸款，正由四聯總處徵求各行局意見硏究，截至目前止，政府主管財政經濟之決策人士，對開放貸款事仍有兩種主張，一派主張開放，一派則持反對意見，惟前次停止貸款，係奉蔣主席命令，故將來開放與否，須俟計細計劃擬妥後，呈請蔣主席作最後決定。</p>

<h3>本年上半年總預算　參駐委會審查報告　建議政府厲行三項基本改革</h3>
<p>〔中央社南京十九日電〕參政會駐會委會審議卅七年上半年度中央政府歲入歲出總預算草案，業於十六日竣事，並通過審查報告，交由該會秘書處整理文字，逕復政府，茲誌該審查報告全文如次：</p>
<p>奉交審查卅七年上半年度中央政府歲入歲出總預算及特別歲入歲出預算案，經本會迭次召集臨時駐會委員會詳加審查，認爲國家在稅源枯竭，支出龐大，而此龐大數字復隨物價猛漲更加龐大情勢之下，欲編造一適合實際具有傎確性之預算，實不可能，本會深體國家當前困難，故不擬對政府所編卅七年度上半年預算普通與特別二部作任何挑剔，亦不擬削减其支出數字，蓋此全爲校節問題，與挽救將來可能招致政治，經濟總崩潰之嚴重危機無關也。</p>
<p>本會認為，國家之健全政策，基於國家之健全預算，今試一檢閱本預算內容，關於生產建設及發展科學敎育等之積極性支出所佔數字極少，而軍費與一般薪給及行政費用等之消極性支出所佔數字極大，即此可知目前所採政策僅在彌縫補苜，以求維持現狀，而其結果則必使生產日縮，耗費日增，誠恐現狀總有難以維持之一日，此不能不令人危欄者也。</p>
<p>本會認為政府欲免於將來可能之政治經濟總崩潰，必痛下決心，厲行下列數項之基本改革：</p>
<h3>厲行精兵主義　革除軍事積弊</h3>
<p>厲行精兵主義，革除軍事積弊　政府不得巳以武力戡亂，以致支出龐大預算，難以平衡，此應爲國民所能諒解，但國軍有優良之武器，數倍之兵員，又在英勇空軍協助之下，何以不能迅速擊潰叛軍，未始非由軍事積弊太甚之故。現在軍事上最大之積弊爲吃空額，照預算編制官兵名額爲五百萬，　　　力似相距甚遠，倘非空額甚多，何至如此，此其結果，不僅浪費國帑，尤在敗壞軍紀，沮喪官兵戰鬥精神，蓋軍隊內倘其將領擁資甚富，又非法謀利，則上行下效，此軍隊必腐化而不能作戰。其次軍事機構自國防部以下，組織之龐大，非戰鬥員兵如副官，差役及衛兵之多，一如國防部朱成立以前，在國防部成立軍事幾層改革之後，猶不能將此種浪費人力，財力之積弊加以革除，未免遺憾。政府今日必須厲行精兵主義，澈底革除軍事　之一切積弊，庶幾戡亂可以早日奏功，而預算亦即易於平衡。</p>
<h3>從速改革幣制　阻止物價飛漲</h3>
<p>從速改革幣制，阻止物價飛漲預算龐大與物價上漲，相關甚密，倘物價今後仍飛漲不止則此時認爲龐大之預算尚不知更須龐大至如何程度，故制止物價飛漲，爲使預算安定之必要條件。制止物價上漲，自應由多方面努力，而减少通貨，穩定幣値，則尤爲急要。今日欲言减少通貨，殊非容易，則惟有改革帝制，以求幣値之稍趨穩定，故本會甚盼政府立即採取有效之準備與步驟，迅速促其實現，以解救目前通貨膨脹，物價上漲相互刺激之循環險象，而期民生之稍得安定也。</p>
<h3>澈底改革內政　擴增財政基礎</h3>
<p>澈底改革內政，擴增財政基礎。預算旣如是龐大，而虧短數額又佔總預算百分之三十九，則決非僅恃節約鏟除私飽與浪費所能挹注，必有賴於舉借內外債，而特別預算草案歲入科目中已明列債款一項，顯示將以借款彌補赤字，我國人民同具愛國熟忱，世界友邦亦有願以經濟力量協助中國復興者，惟多藉口我行政效率低落與官僚腐收，　疑不前，本會以爲我國處此嚴重局面，欲求國人信任政府發行之債券及友邦貸款早日成功，必須澈底改革內政，深盼政府以國內外反對政府，批評政府之言論爲鑑，傎心收攬入手，傎心實行民主，傎心鑛除政治上一切積弊，則人民必踴躍購銷債劵，而友邦貸款亦可不求而自來矣。</p>
<h3>科學文化經濟　應請政府注意</h3>
<p>此外，尙有一事，不得不提請政府注意者，本年已開始行意，而憲法一百六十四條明定「敎育科學文化之經費，在中央不得少於其預算總額百分之十五……」，本預算單就普通部份尚不及此數，若合特別部份計之，則相差更遠矣。</p>
<p>最後本會年來屢言在財富日益不均之現况下，力主平均負担，課暴富者以特捐，今預算之歲收已屆羅掘絕境，政府應立下決心，厲行過分利得稅，我以政治力量，征借國人富有者之財產及其存放外國之款項，應得挹注，一平赤字，而渡空前之難關。</p>
<h3>國民黨中央紀念週　徐堪報告預算情形</h3>
<p>〔中央社南京十九日電〕國府主計長徐堪，十九日晨在國民黨中央黨部紀念週席上報告：本年上半年度總預算，歲出總數爲九十六萬餘億，但各項稅收，亦多增加，總計稅收及處議物資歲入，達五十八萬餘億，佔總歲入百分之六十一，收支相差百分之卅九，政府正謀舉辦特捐，及國外援助等辦法補救，使不致如過去恃發行以資支出。又稱：本年度以公務人員之生活補助費之支出爲最大，此實爲物價高漲情形下之特殊現象，祗要戡亂完成，特別部門之支出，則可減少。徐氏並指陳，祗有穩定幣値，穩定物價，始可挽回當前政治經濟之危頗。</p>

<h3>由美援麥粉說到掌握物資</h3>
<p>昨天下午本市招商局第一碼頭招待所裏，舉行了美援第一批救濟物，接受典禮，那是一件很有意義的事情。昨天中國所接受的為求救濟麵粉八千噸，雖不過美援物資的一小部份，但在這糧食恐慌的時期中，中國政府有了美國源源而來的援助，就可開始實行京滬平津穗五大都市平民食糧的普遍配售，以期達到穩定糧價的目的，更從而以配售物資的價款，購辦其他救濟物資，普遍散發於全國亟待救濟的人民。此在中美邦交史上，更是翻開了新的一頁；美國對華這樣及時而有效的援助，眞可說是中國的患難朋友。中國人民尤其是首先接受這批麥粉的上海市民，對此，一定都表示着由衷的感謝。</p>
<p>我們在這一點上，實可證明十七日本市為抗議九龍事件而遊行的學生行列，寫着不堪入目的標語，一定是若干別有用心者之所為，決非一般善良市民的公意。天下事，總該平心靜氣的想一想，「以怨報德」的行為，決為泱大國的人民所不齒。</p>
<p>本報今天不想多論到我們應該如何答謝美國盟邦這種好意，却願從美援物資的開始到來，說到我們政治今後究　如何掌握物資，如何運用那些掌握的物資以减少或解除經濟的艱困。</p>
<p>說到掌握物資，這種議論原不自今日始。抗戰以來，因為軍用需要的迫切，國外來原的阻斷，各地生產事業備受摧殘，水陸運輸又處處受到阻礙，於是重物輕幣的觀念，不期而深和於人心。在人民則多方儲藏，以備緩急，以便居寄，以保幣值：而在國家亦不憚四出搶購，極力搜羅，以厚積貯，而便運用。復員而還，已逾兩載，通貨等問題，均未能順利解決，故掌握物資把握物資等論調，在今日依然為當局一貫的政策。</p>
<p>就政府所採取的手段而言，其用以把握的途徑，大約可分為八類：（一）為接受敵偽物資；（二）為國營生產事業的出口：（三）為接受友邦的貸助或贈與：（四）為分得敵國的賠償物品；（五）為向國外定購的進口貨；（六）為循貸款方式所得的定貨；（七）為用種種方法收購的農產品；（八）為由民營事業在管制方式下所得的出品。其中一至五項問題較少；第六項為經濟改革方案所定的辦法之一，但時將半載，其實施草案方經擬就。其第七收購項下，又可分自由競購（如管制會成立前之棉花），國家專買（如燃管會指定區域之煤斤）；與官司價收買（如各省攤購之米糧）三種，這些都曾引起了不少的爭議和阻力。平民營產品，由國家統購統銷，以在紡織事業中最近所施行的全面管理為最着，能否順利展開尚有待於事實的證明。</p>
<p>一般意見，總以為國家掌握物資，不問其動機如何？要不可不確守下面這幾個信條；其一。要顧到生產者的適當利潤，不可過於抑勒賤買，致破壞了他們的再生產。其二，要維持原有事業的生存和發展，不可殺鷄取卵，只圖一時之快意。其三，國營民營，要在機會均等的原則下平行前進，公道競爭，不可顯分厚薄，致摧折了民族工業的脆弱基礎。其四，國家掌握物資，自有其偉大的使命，不可眼光如豆，乘機漁利，尤不能讓經辦人員上下其手，致蒙獨佔壟斷與營私舞弊之譏。</p>
<p>原來國家所以掌握物資，其最正當的用途，不外乎下列五項：（一）為辦理配給。其意在平物價，裕民用。故不問其所配的對象，是直接的消費者，或是加工的製造者，而一經抬價漁利，另具作用，便完全失去了原來的用意。（二）為推廣出口。這原是　外銷路惡劣時不得已的辦法。其意在於推動外銷，爭取外匯，與單純的營　事業亦自有別。為維持國內生產者的利益，同時為擴展海外市塲起見，國家收此項物資，應具有遠大的與永久的目光，不宜斤斤於目前的得失，就使一時虧本也要做的。（三）為供給軍用。戰亂期間，軍用第一，這更屬完全消耗性質，不發生利益作用。（四）為調劑盈虛，就是把甲地多餘的物資，供給物資缺少的乙地，或是把丙地較廉的物，轉運到物價較高的丁地，用以達到抑平物價是，安定民生的目標。這一點，應是國家掌握物資的最大作用。辦理這項事務，亦可能買賤賣貴，因而獲得相當的利潤，但其宗旨旣在抑平物價，安定民生，則卽偶爾賺錢，亦不過是意外的副作和，不當視為天經地義。（五）為减少投機。就是把大量物資，控制在政府手裏，使一般「奸商」無貨可囤，卽是無機可投，無奇可居，這也似乎言之成理。但經政府控制了的物價，如果政府不按一定的官價，定量定時，分批應銷，而亦隨時漲價，追隨黑市，便好像政府自己做了大囤戶，又失去了原來的作用。</p>
<p>照上面所舉的這幾點看來，可知政府把握物資，並不應以收入為唯一目的，況且當局歷來所公表的語言文字上看來，亦從沒有一次把收入目的明折牽混在內。所以辦理此項事務的公務員，皆應問體此意，認清目標，避免一切副作用，以求明確推一，不致中途走樣或變質。</p>
<p>最近政府擬定擴大配售，安定民生，一面籌物交換，以調整國際貿易，這都不失為掌握物資的正當辦法。其以紗布掉換印棉，購洋麥，供各粉廠製粉，或收購菜籽大荳，以充製油原料，此等措施，其於國計民生，尤不無小補。而此次美援食糧分捐運化，更可促普徧配售，實施確可稱道所惜過去頗有一類目光短淺之人，專打小算盤，每每於辦理收購時，假借平價名義，任意抑勒，致農民遭受到意外的損失，而在配出時，却又托名調整，屢次漲價，不惜公然與黑市賽跑。其所得的鉅額利潤，又往往七折八扣，任意開支，形同少數人的分肥，並款能涓滴歸公，甚有公家代購收購其名，而私人變相囤積其實，利用其雄厚的實力，廣大的機構，和優越匠地位，以與普通商民爭一日之短長。這在國家正將推行具掌握物資政策的時候，實在不容不嚴切注意和糾正的。</p>

<h3>英國會今日重開　貝文外交政策將改絃易轍</h3>
<p>〔聯合社倫數十八日電〕國會於聖誕節休會一月，定於星期二復會，星期四起辯論外交事務兩日，屆時貝文外長將陳述政府外交政策。自倫敎四國外長會議破裂以來，英國外交政策，經數次閣議，榮已重新諭定，此外國會將討論煤氣業收歸國營法案。本屆會議最重要之議案，或當為財長克里普斯於四月間提出之預算案。國會復會後對於傭君伊麗莎白公主及附馬之年俸，不免發生一塲爭論。</p>
<p>〔聯合社倫敦十八日電〕貝文外長於星期四向國會陳述英國外交政策時，將聲明工黨政府對付共產主義之策略，不復僅僅在採取守勢，而當促進西歐與美國之堅强合作。至與蘇聯，則僅願在五十對五十之平等基礎上謀諒解。此爲保全各國愛護自由民族及民主理想之唯一希望·貝文心目中所謂西歐與美國之合作，大致不出經濟性質，並非軍事同盟之謂，至少在初期是如此，俾奠定完成馬歇爾援歐復興計　之某礎。貝文此項演　或即爲英國正式放棄中間路綫政策，不復以拉　美蘇自任。美國原希望在戰爭結束至和約訂立之過渡時期內，成爲東西兩方間之橋　，茲不得不改絃更張。此種新將錢，近來已有跡象可尋，艾德禮總理及莫理遜副總理目前先後發表演說，即其端倪。</p>

<p>英大使殷佛却貝爾週內將訪馬　爾國務卿治談此事。據悉，英外相貝文對於德國現狀極度憂慮，認爲可能在整個西歐引起嚴重反響，並妨碍馬歇爾方案之施行。英官員將貝文之意告知國務部時，並强調魯爾區之治安責任雖在英國，然輸入糧食以接濟該區，則不得不由美國負起責任。料美國官員週內即將審查以原擬運住他處之糧食移供魯爾，以消減魯爾動亂原因的可能性。　〔路透社柏林十八日電〕接近蘇軍政府之人士稱，德境蘇軍總司令索柯洛夫斯基於一週前返莫斯科，與蘇高級當局討論英美合併區之經濟行政新措施，原定十七日返柏林，結果並未歸來，係由於天氣惡劣不能成行，拘由於討論尚未結束，猶未探悉。但料於週一柏林樂管會開會之前必當返柏林。同時據悉定於三月十八日開會之德人民大會，將就在全　舉行公民投票以決定政治及經濟統一之議，舉行表決，茶蘇聯退出盟管會而建立東德國家，則此項全德公民投票勢將不能舉行，故料蘇聯對於英美合倂區之經濟行政新措施於提出嚴重抗議後，當靜坐觀察其反響，不致　即退出盟管會。</p>

<p>〔路透社華盛頓十九日電〕參院外交委員會，今日恢復審查馬歇爾方案時，對該案有更嚴竣的批評，以削减方案實施後第一年內撥款。此項趨勢，在國會中已益趨明顯。政府方面人士，就該案陳述之意見，巳告畢事，自本週起，陳述意見者將爲批評該案之人物。</p>
<p>今日出席陳辭之人中，包括著名經濟家總統之顧問巴魯赫，渠對援助數額及管理方式均將提出意見，前近曾與已氏晤談之參議員皆謂巴氏對馬歇爾方案並不熟烈贊成。星期一蒞外委會陳述意見者，包括共和黨外交顧問社勒斯等，查杜魯門所要求在最初十五個月內之援歐費用為六十八億元，國會一部份議員，則卞張削减援歐第一年之費用至四十億元。共和黨參議院塔虎脫主張削减之數更在此數之下，渠指出杜魯門所提下一會計年度之預算案中，歐洲復興計劃費用之支出實際僅四十億元，故渠認總統對於削减援助額之行動，已在意料之中。塔虎脫並曰：近有主張第一年內由美財部撥付之援歐費用，不得逾四十億元惟准許政府訂購此數以外之其他供應品者，換言之，即政府於支付此等其他供應品之貨價時，尚須再請國會准許撥款，因此使國會對援歐方案之執行，又多一次討論機會。塔虎脫並表示，渠個人則主張在第一年內美財部所撥付援歐費不得逾三十億元又參議院撥款委員會主席勃利奇，最近亦表示渠之委員會亦將研究削减第一年內援歐所撥現款之可能性。渠力言「無論如何參院撥款委會在通過撥款前，對援歐方案將作縝密審查」</p>

<p>首由繆主委，吳市長等領導來資參觀「加利福尼亞」號儲藏麵粉大倉窖，時工人正在起卸麵粉，忙碌異常。據悉：該輪於前日抵滬後立即開始卸貨，工人六百名畫夜工作，約已卸去三萬包左右，全部麵粉可於本週六卸竣，屆時該輪即將起程返國。全部麵粉，估計須五大倉庫方能容納。又另一輪「尼可拉斯·拉巴第亞」號載小麥八千七百長噸，亦已抵滬，停泊四號五號浮筒，現亦在卸貨中。該項小麥係散裝，一而由工人起卸，一面即分送本市各大麵粉廠加緊磨粉，全部貨物亦須六日至八日始可卸畢。</p>
<p>繆氏致詞　表示感謝</p>
<p>來賓繆參觀招商局倉　，然後由繆主委茶會招待。席間繆氏致詞略稱：中美政府自於去年十月二十七日簽訂美救濟中國三千萬元物資之協定後，雙方即加緊工作，分頭準備，中國政府組織本委員會，美政府亦同樣積極購買中國人民生活所必需之物資，作爲救濟品，其中尤以糧食爲主，此外尚有醫藥物資，及一部份肥料，種　等。本人今日在此接收第一艘物資，深感此二月餘米，運輸及處理物資工作能順利進行，不稍躭擱者，皆因兩國政府協力合作，及與美中救濟團主任吉爾派加立克及代理主任摩迪氏等不斷交換意見之結果，本人願代表中國政府同美政府及夫人民以及船長船　等深致　勞感謝之意。</p>
<p>五大都市　設配售會</p>
<p>繆氏復報告本月二十六日，「夏威夷」號將載運麵粉七千噸抵滬，另有「華盛頓郵船」及另一船均　於本月下旬裝載糧食來滬。全　救濟種食十二萬五千噸於二三　內均可到齊。現決定在京。滬·　·平·津五大都市首先設立配售委員會，根據五市人口，以公平普遍方法配售，每人每月可得五升米，預期可維持四個月，若按每人一月需米一斗五計算，則可解決三分之一之需要，又配售價格較市價略低，每月調整一次，藉此亦可平穩一部份物價。</p>
<p>至其配售後所得資金，則將全部用作普遍性之救濟。本會已組織衛生醫藥，及社會救濟二委員會，由社會部及衛生部長分別主持。救濟機關中有急需是項物品者，均可向本會申請。如事實許可，本曾或將自辦救濟機構，俟中美專家共同計劃審核後，即可撥款。</p>
<p>象徵兩國　互相友愛</p>
<p>旋由美總領事卡勃脫致詞略謂：本人初抵此間，即能參加今日接收首批物資典禮，深爲愉快。此項救濟物資，即象徽兩國人民間互相友愛，互相帮一助之誠意。深信將來之世界，必能爲愛好自由之人民，共同在和平，繁榮由生活。是項糧食係美國人民贈給目前暫時受苦之中國人民，並可視作美國願意繼續救濟，與恢復戰後秩序之明證。</p>
<p>天助自助　解決困難</p>
<p>吳市長繼起致詞，引　語「天助自助」「患艱之交」兩句，謂中國在令日艱難困苦中，一方而必須盤力以自助精言，　　物資解決困難，一方面並　　實「患難之交」之美國友人繼續供給我國物資。本人代表上海人民謹向美國致謝。</p>
<p>最後，潘議長代表上海市參議會致詞稱，我國抗戰前後，中美共同作戰，成爲「惠難之交」。戰後中國人民復受到「患難之交」之友誼幫助，建設復興，此種誠摯友愛，將使中國人民永矢弗忘。此次美國救濟物資育批運到上海，本人代表上海市參議會，表示深切感謝，並致歡迎之意。</p>
<h3>計口授糧二三月間開始　公敎工人配米屆時廢止</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕本市全面計口授糧，定自二月中旬或三月初起實行。屆時並將買行憑證購種制度，詳細實施辦法正在草擬中。社會局長吳開先昨與記者談實施該制度之目的，係在節約糧食消桂。今後本市市民將不論其身份職　，規定每人每月之食米消耗　，二斗，小口减牛。其中一斗由政府配售，一斗准向自由市　購　，由政府分別發給「配售證」及「准購證」。屆時公敎人員及產職業工人配米辦法均將廢止。菜館飯店則每月發給一定數量之食米，以供在本市無戶籍之流動人口食用。該制度實施後，米種流通並不禁止，但各米號對無「准購證」之願客則不得售予食本。政府將根據登記之米商進貨數量及繳銷之准購證，審核其有否作弊。因每一市民仍可向米店購米一斗，故對米商之生存並不威脅。政府並爲防止漏洞，對麵粉亦將統制。如市民不慣食米而喜吃麵粉者，可於領取准聯證時聲明改購麵粉，以四斗米折合一袋麵粉計算。但申報確定後則不能再作變更。上碩業務由民食調配委員會負資，調配會現祗主持　百三十萬人之糧食配售事宜，現旣將肩負全市五百萬市民繼食調配之重任，故勢非改組擴大不可。</p>

<h3>工協再電呼籲　開放工貸濟急</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕全國工業協會近以農曆年關轉瞬即屆，各業需款孔殷，爰再呈電蔣主席及行政院呼籲，請求政府迅即開放工貸，以濟眉急。原電略調：自政府停止工貸後，各地生產界均感痛苦，雖過去辦理工貸，容有未盡善處，但不能因噎廢食。今距廢曆年關不遠，如政府不予貸款，一部份工廠將以資金週轉不靈而被迫停閉，其後果非特釀成工人失業，且對整個金融界亦蒙嚴重影響云。</p>

<h3>杭州鬧屋荒</h3>
<p>〔本報杭州十八日訊〕由於戰時的普遍破壞，勝利以後各地都鬧屋荒，杭州的屋荒雖不及上海嚴重，不像上海那麼動不動，就要金條，但這主要的還是客觀條件的限制，因爲杭州原是一個風景的和政治的都市，在上海，商人多金，幾根條子不在乎，而一般的杭州人，以幾百萬至幾千萬元的數目頂住屋，已是非常實的負担了。何况杭州的房租論米，普通一兩間小淤的月租須付一担米，爾担米，米價隨時窩漲，比上海的房租總要高得多了，而且杭州離上海近，交通便利，房東受上海的影響，總想把</p>
<p>頂費租費　竭力往上抬，因此，住屋問題在杭州始終是一個嚴重的問題·近來各縣鄉間股匪濟伏活動，人口有集中都市的趨勢。杭市人口，較戰前突增，而政府在復員期間，百端待理，無暇顧及房屋，亦罕財力建造，於是房東壓榨更烈，問題也就更嚴實了。</p>
<p>去年「行總」浙江分署，對於解救崖荒，也曾努力過一番，大事興築「善後新邨」，但畢克粥少信多，愛惠者祗是極少數的一部份貧民，雖然，在「行總」已是最大的努力了。市政府也曾計劃在保叔山後</p>
<p>大量興建　民平住宅，但至今尙未實現，而屋荒却一刻不離的威脅着市民，尤其是淸苦的公敎人員。　省府日前曾決定在水亭址興建公務員住宅，不久即可開工，但總數祗有五幢，那裏够得上分配呢？政府雖已明令公敎人員薪俸，以後一律按生活指數發給，但房租照米價算，薪水還是跟不上。有些公務員一月的全部收入，甚至連付房租也不够。他們說：「我們一天不吃飯，勉强尚可以挨餓，可是房子一天發生問題，就容身無地了」。爲了解決這個問題，巳經有四百餘人，簽名發起組織房客聯誼會，</p>
<p>發表宣言　籲請各界主持公道，聯合全　房客，謀以有效方法，集體對付。這不僅是公敎人員本身的問題，也是杭州全體市民切身的問題，所以同情和響應的人很多。他們在宣言中，特別提出：</p>
<p>八項要求　　房租不得以米計算，更不　收取挖費小費頂費或其他類似　名目。</p>
<p>房租應由主管機關，邀同房會聯合會代表，組織杭市房租徵收委員會訂定標準頒布之。</p>
<p>所有空房，除酌留數間房東目用外，應全部出租。</p>
<p>租房未經滿期之房屋，不得　端收回，已滿期應有　租之優九權。</p>
<p>要求政府迅即建造大批平房，如抗戰時期重慶之房屋，以利民居而免房荒。</p>
<p>要求法院主持公道，不得爲　利房東之判決。</p>
<p>房東不得以非法手段强迫房客遷讓，如房東蠻不講理，我們房客亦應以集體力量一致援助同</p>
<p>請求各銀行停止商鰍貸款，應由政府勒令或命令其投資建造房屋租賃，以解除房荒之威脅。如果這些希望能够澈底實現，則屋荒自可迎刃而解，不但不再「嚴重」，而且也可能不成爲「問題」了。</p>
<p>輿諭界對這罰運動的反應是甚爲贊同的。他們一面要求政府迅速提出</p>
<p>解救房荒　的辦法來，一間籲請大房東，二房東們以道義的精神，放遠眼光，爲貧苦的杭州市民和公敎人員讓步。公敎人員的聯名宣言，雖然不是法令，但它已在杭州的市民羣中掀起波瀾，得到由衷的同情，希望由這篇宣言的影響，至少要把杭州的房荒减輕下來，使淸苦的公教人員和市民們不再日夜為房子愁苦，而可以安心爲社會服務。（記者黃行天）</p>

<h3>爭取湖南的煤產</h3>
<p>〔本報長沙十五日航訊〕煤的種類，大別之爲烟煤與無烟煤兩種，都是作燃料用的，不過烟煤含的揮發物高，火燄長，並且多有油質，所以通常把她作爲發動機器，燒煱爐的用途，也就是工業和交通上的主要燃料，同時，因爲她含有各種不同的化學物質，用低溫蒸溜法，可以得到各種不同的化學產物，如汽油重油地瀝靑，和多種鮮艷有用的顏料，所以烟煤在工業上是具有極大的價値的。至於無烟煤，其價値則遜於烟煤。無烟煤就是俗稱柴煤，也呌做白煤，揮發物低，通常僅作家庭炊事用的一種燃料。因此，她是人類不可一日缺的一種重要用品，尤其在大都市裏，如果一旦發生烟煤的恐慌，其嚴重性並不亞於米糧的缺乏。</p>
<p>中國的煤礦，大都在北方，著名的如東北的撫順開灤，山西的井陘，山東的臨城，安徽河南的焦作，福中公司，還有江蘇的賈汪，都是很大的煤礦，儲量豐富，展延到非常的廣大。戰前各礦的產量最高的時候，一個礦，一天就可產煤到兩萬五千多公噸，合計起來。</p>
<p>北方煤礦的生產數量是相當可觀的。至於湖南，素有魚米之鄉之目，照理她是產米之區，礦產不會如何體富，但很奇怪，湖南得天獨厚，她一面是湖沼交錯，出產魚米，另一面山陵綿延，礦產豐富，鐵·鉛道類的礦藏，暫時不提，煤礦在湖南也是大宗的蘊藏，其數量比之北方，自然是瞠乎其後，不過也約有一千二百七十多兆噸，在西南各省中，算是首屈一指的。</p>
<p>湖南煤礦的生長情形，因地質關係，變化很多，有的成爲一包一包的，一槽一槽的，開礦的人，他們喊做槽子，或者呌做縫，其中平舖勻整，展延很寬的比較少。其分佈的情形，地質家把她分做湘水，黔陽·辰谿·斗嶺·石門口五個煤系。其分佈地帶，大概在湘水流域的畏沙，湘潭·寗湘·湘鄉·醴陵·攸縣·衡山·衡陽·常寗·零陵·耒陽·永興·資興·郴縣·桂陽·嘉禾·臨武。宜軍各縣，資永流域的益陽，安化·新化·邵陽·武岡各縣，沅水流械的沅陵·辰谿·瀘溪·溆浦·黔陽，會同·芷江各縣。此外，石門·慈利，澶縣·大庸·桑植各縣，也都有煤。分佈之廣，可以說是遍及全省。從前西洋人以爲東方的中國遍地黃金，遭是誇大之詞。但湖南冠以</p>
<p>遍地黑煤　倒一點也不誇大，而且是確確實實，百分之一百的事實。　戰前湘南的煤礦是不爲國人所重視的，大家的目光都射在北方，所以湖南煤也和棄兒似的遺棄在道旁沒有人去理會，即使過去湖南早就在掘煤了，但是規模要和北方比較，那是大巫與小巫之別。不過，時代不斷的變遷，這棄兒似的湖南煤，自從抗戰勝利後，北方被共匪騷擾得沒有一塊乾淨土，交通亦多不通，東南各地听需烟煤來源的北方斷絕了，運到出煤所在的山東青島，也告煤荒，大家於是轉移目光，望到湖南這塊土上來，因此湖南煤突然走上了宏運，身價百倍，棄兒竟成了天之驕子。湖南煤礦的開採，近年來有着驚人的成績，其經營辦理的情形，大約可分爲國營·省營·公營·民營四類。國營的都是行政院資源委員會主管。所辦的除開官商合辦的永興一帶的湘永等礦爲無烟煤外，其餘永邵煤礦局經營的零陵黑山口與邵陽牛馬司，中湖煤礦局經營的湘潭譚家山，官商合辦的湘江煤礦公司所開採的湘潭楊家橋，還有與省府合辦的湖湘煤礦，（經營湘潭雲湖）中湘煤礦各區，都是烟煤，現在的一產量，永邵每月約三千噸，湘江約六千噸，合計約有一萬噸的光景。此外，都在</p>
<p>進行設備時期。至其他劃定的辰谿，湘鄉各縣的國營鑛，現在都還沒有興工開辦。</p>
<p>省營的有醴陵，祁陽觀音灘，寗鄉淸溪三礦。醴陵·祁陽兩鑛，以前每月的產量到過一萬五六千噸，不過戰時被破壞得很厲害，戰扣因爲沒有向中央請得復員經費，只得因陋就簡，收集修配一些殘存破壞的機器，來把他緊急復工，到現在，醴陵還只能產煤每月兩千多噸，觀音灘產煤五千多噸。</p>
<p>公營的煤礦，規模最大的要算以前廣州行營曾養甫先生主辦的宜章楊梅山，資興掛鼓嶺，湘潭華石的各煤礦，現在的產量每月約共有一萬六七千公噸。</p>
<p>此外，湖南煤礦最多的就是民營煤礦了。民營的公司礦廠，已經政府核准發照的，一共有四百多家。還在進行中而沒有發照的，尚未計算在內。不過，這些公司，除開郴縣的三合，寗鄉的守一，訓惠·辰谿的合組，惠民及其他的少數幾家，規模尚稱略具外，其餘就多數是一些小資本經營，沒有什麼大規模的工程設備了。以上四類鑛廠每月的產量，綜計不到五萬噸，以與過去北方產煤每廠一天就有兩萬餘噸比較，相差誠有霄壞之別。今日北方的煤產已瀕完全停頓的階段，無論戰事繼續在擴大，即使戰禍不波及，有些原來的機器都給人搬跑了，要想在短期內恢復昔日的盛况，巳是萬難做到的事了。湖南有天賦的煤藏，有小康的安定局面，正是得著「天時，」「地理，」如果再加以「人和，」則湖南煤礦的論述，誠不可限量。湖南在煤礦能够發達了，不僅有裨於湖南一省的國民經濟，尤其關係國家工業的需要，和軍事水陸交通燃料的供給。所以湖南無論在省內或旅外的人士，都知進向道方面去爭取收益。中央對開發湖南煤礦，亦極注意，僕僕北方道上的孫越崎副委員長，也移駕到湖南來視察了，說明中央對開採煤鑛的看法，與其北方的大最開採一時辦不到，還不如向湖南的小量着手。俗語所謂：「實多不如現得」。何况如果大家集中力量，以湖南煤藏之豐，每天增產到一兩萬噸也不是不可能的事。站在湖南經濟立塲來說，爭取湖南煤產，今日是千載一時的機會。應該要好好把握這個機會，勿讓她交臂失之呵！（特派員黃潮如）</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕中國紡建公司昨循例售紗，共售六九九件，合廿支纱一一三三四件半，申購者共三三八戶。售價廿支紗三三七五萬元，較上期略低。</p>
<p>現棉續疲</p>
<p>昨日現棉市况，交易仍少，同業多因銀根緊急，進出甚微。紡建收購登記花衣，因開價不高，收進不多，趨勢續疲，成交二五八包。靈寶做開棧交價六二萬五千，沙市五四五萬六千，火機送廠價做開四六三萬，周浦籽花一一四萬。</p>
<p>華股前市銷沉　午後由疲轉穩</p>
<p>華股昨初疲後穩，銀根左右大局，中途即交永紗會破入七〇〇元大關，人心易於激昂，買氣尚未全泯。午後復露轉機而見秀</p>
<p>晨初不利，開盤除火柴尚平，餘均見疲。永紗以七一五元及七四六元之價上塲，開後升至七三四元及七五八元之高價，以供售即交者多，塲外息價開三角及三角四分半，乃退至七一〇元及七三二元，嗣後升降　定，近午乃破七百大關，散多斬殺，降至六九六元及七一八元低價，午收爲六九九元及七二五元。結果較上週六計即交股華豐信誼大通榮豐各跌一成，華新中法新華勤興信和美亞巾紡中絲火柴永公麗安內衣各降半成，餘均微挫。遞交股華　勤興各跌一成，美亞信和新光景福降半成，永紗微降。</p>
<p>後市銀根微有轉機，人心一振，永紗開出即昂至七二　元及七二九元，買至七二六一兀及七四二元，繼而再進至七三元及七五〇元高價，此時脫售者紛起，而退至七一二元及七三〇元，收市爲七三〇元及七五〇元。結果較晨收即交股榮豐信和美亞華豐內衣中法各升半成，巾絲升一成，餘均小升。遞交股景福漲半成，餘均微升。場外各未上市股票中華書局回跌半成，餘均被銀根所迫低。</p>
<h3>物價漲勢稍戢</h3>
<p>邇來本市各種物價漲勢，已略見减少。昨據東方經濟研究所發　，上週（本月十二日至十七日）之本市基要日用品零售物價指數如下：</p>
<p>食物類為一一九，九一一倍，較前週漲千分之一百三十五。</p>
<p>衣着類爲一〇四，六七九倍，較前　漲千分之一百十。</p>
<p>燃料類爲一五二，六五九倍，較前週漲千分之一百四十一。</p>
<p>雜項類爲二二七，七一八倍，較前週漲千分之一百十三。</p>
<p>總指數爲一四四，五三〇倍。較前週漲千分之一百二十八。</p>
<p>總計上週之日用品中，以燃料類上漲較多，此因燃料之來源减少之故，食物類次之，衣着類因以往漲勢過烈，而市民之購買力日益薄弱銷路少，故上週之减少最多。</p>
<h3>退票創新紀錄　上週八四八二億</h3>
<p>上海票據交換所，昨（十九）日發表本年第二週十二日至十七日，交換票據退票總金額爲八千四百八十二億元，較之第一週退票金額，計增加四千八百九十四億元。</p>
<h3>統債下隆　外股略回</h3>
<p>公債昨人心仍難振作，下降不少，統丙晨開八萬五，低價七萬四，最後在七萬八左右徘徊。承德三六〇室五二〇室賣出，紗花帮由五〇三買進，五五〇室五五五室買進，成交約三百萬。結果較上週六計甲乙丁各跌六千元，丙戊各跌七千元。</p>
<p>外股昨中途雖疲，但臨收仍易覆上，怡紗晨開五四萬，退至五一萬而後有回。最後仍站定於五五萬收市，散戶維持，證券帮出後亦進，廣帮洋行帮則售，較上週六計祥泰墾植各升半成，業廣跌半成，鋼業尚平，會德豐紙版怡啤航業電話微挫，怡紗英聯電車小升。</p>
<h3>外埠現鈔流抵本市　總逾數七千億元</h3>
<p>匝月以來，外埠各地現鈔紛紛流滬，據金融界估計，迄目下爲止，流滬現鈔數字，已達七千億元之鉅，致外埠各地現鈔極感缺乏，尤以平津等華北各地爲最，各該地各銀錢業均感困難，且銀根奇緊，較滬爲甚。</p>
<p>金融當局爲解除此項流弊起見，已嚴令海關及其他各海陸空查緝人員，加緊査緝違法携運現鈔來滬，一經査獲，即依法嚴辦，決不寬貸。同時並籌商嚴峻之具體取締辦法中云。</p>
<p>銀根奇緊</p>
<p>近日銀根奇緊，較小之行莊甚至因數萬元之現鈔無法軋入，而軋賬軋至深夜者。據中央銀行業務局負責人談稱：造成此種原因者有二：</p>
<p>過去中央銀行抽緊銀根之時，因內地各城市匯來之匯款較多，故銀根未見有如此之緊况。近日因平津漢等地，其本身之銀根亦甚緊，無法再將餘款匯來滬上　，因此造成本市之銀根緊中再緊</p>
<p>銀根奇緊中，暗息有高至三角者，少數之行莊因貧利息，遂將餘款放出，但在銀根緊時，放款往往不易收回，於是速累各該行莊本身亦緊。在此種情况下，國行爲調節市塲需要，不再故意務使在農舊年關前，本市之物價不致因銀根鬆濫而有所暴漲，使人民能安渡年關。</p>
<h3>行莊往來存戶　應詳細具報</h3>
<p>財政部上海金融管理局，爲防止各行莊濫用支票起見，特規定各行莊應於本月底前，將其往來存戶住址及姓名，分別具報備査。如該局認爲有情形可疑者，即令其停止開戶。</p>
<h3>報關行營業照費　照原定額加十倍</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕江海關昨公告：略以修正管理報關規則第四條所定營業執照費，及換照費，與同規則第五條所定保蹬金，自本年一月一日起，概應按照原定數額十倍收費。</p>
<p>又自即日起，至二月二十日止，爲各報關行重行註册期間。各報關行如願繼續經營報關業務者，應於上開限期內，至本關總務課辦理手續，並應遵照新增數額，繳納保證金及換照費，換領新照，逾期概作未註册論，停止其營業云。</p>
<h3>附表三甲加成數　中信局即可公佈</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕處理自備外匯貨品審議會，對附表　甲類貨品加成數，巳按照市價高低，分別加以決定。種類計有一百餘種，其中主要者爲煤油燈酒精燈煤氣用器電扇電筒電熨斗縫紉機電話機電報機及其配件，打字機，計算機，及未列名建築材料等。平均加成數，最低者約加百分之七十，其次爲百分之一百，最高爲百分之二百。詳細數字，中信局日內即可分佈。又今日審議會將論西藥及化學原料加成數。</p>
<h3>粵絲按七成收購　證產銷會昨開委員會</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕議絲產銷協導委員會第三十四次委員會，於昨日（十九日）午後二時，假該會會議室舉行。到有委員褚輔成等二十餘人，由該會主任委員　熙鴻主席。</p>
<p>計有報告事項五件：　三十六年春期各貸款廠商，暨合作社實准予備査。　本會議定卅六年秋貸　繭繅工費用，及收絲成本，計算標準，奉經農兩部令，己轉請行政院鑒核備査，並分函財部四聯總處査照．　廣東收絲成數業經四聯總處核准，按七成收購．　卅六年春貸廠商應繳絲量，及應付絲款，業經有關機關審核完畢，從事收絲付款。　宣讀上次會議紀錄。</p>
<p>討論事項重要案件計有二件：　秋絲　工費及收絲成本，業經計算，請討論案。議決：照案通過，並呈部備案。　秋季應繳絲量　折計算，及應收成數，提請討論案。議決：　除照抽樣實際　折外，其餘照規定烘抑　折計算。　三區公會要求援春季例入成繳解，由會呈部請示。</p>
<h3>人造絲疲輭　廠經市况仍寂</h3>
<p>人造絲昨市疲　，一二〇號旭字有光，上午開盤九千〇七十萬元有成交，旋即升至一百萬元做開。迄午收盤，高至三百萬元，隔日期四百五十萬元有成交，午後呈疲。最後價做一百萬元，較上週六短三百萬元之譜。</p>
<p>廠經</p>
<p>昨市仍寂，各級有單五担頭均無成交，喊價與上週六相仿。D字拆担價做九千五百萬元，E字拆担價做三百五十萬元，高零担三百萬元，中級零担一百萬元，亦有幾担成交。干經喊價並無變化。</p>
<p>綢貨</p>
<p>昨市堅　，華强眞絲被面，即期最大做一百卅萬元，收市即期鋒至一百萬元，隔日期做一百四十萬元。某他綢貨，因原料並無　動，故肇盤俱無升隆。</p>
<h3>淮南華東二煤礦　大量存煤將運滬</h3>
<p>燃管會爲供應本市燃煤，不致缺乏起見，曾派運输處長伍餡應氏晋京，向交部請示，並赴徐州津浦路局接洽交通工具，及視察淮南，華東兩煤礦生產情况與存煤數量。</p>
<p>伍氏已於昨日返滬，向記者告稱：津浦路局車皮已洽妥，現已開始自徐州裝煤向浦口運輸中，淮南華東二煤礦，現存煤量爲十餘萬噸，下月中旬以前可全部運至浦口，再裝船　運來滬供應。</p>
<p>其他台煤及民營商辦江西湖南湖北四川山東等地之小型煤礦，產量及遝輸力亦均同時加强，故本市認爲最　重之煤荒問題，當可逢刃而解云。</p>
<h3>食米雲化活絡　雜糧油市均跌</h3>
<p>昨食米市况，盤旋轉昂。北市塲價格較上週六提升二萬元，因連日市勢不振，阪戶减少，市上浮貨去盡，一部份貨主不忍低脫，而起扳持之念。觀望多日之本街，亦補取較殷，去化旣見活絡，價乃砌高。無錫白粳重見一百四十萬兀，薄稻，早稻一致提升二萬，特高粳一百四十四萬，丹陽白元一百五十一萬，其他秈米均挺。南市塲開市甚平，中途聞北市上升，市亦轉呈堅象。結果早稻等略見挺一二萬元，白粳仍站原價。昨日到貨，南市塲九千一百四十六石，北市一萬〇五百七十一石。</p>
<p>麵粉續見削低，北帮無胃，實銷懈淡，而散戶吐售不絕，市况萎靡日甚。兵船粉五十四萬，較上週降萬餘。老車粉則以貨稀，下降僅二千元，交易不多，其他雜牌粉一致疲落。麩皮因速跌已鉅，昨市反見挺升萬元·小麥跌價，廠盤開八十萬元。</p>
<p>雜糧大致轉昂，少數下降。黃豆客胃不納，市呈平疲。苞米，菉豆，靑島帮納取頗多，各升四五萬元。紅糧平平，豇豆北銷亦活，挺升萬元。赤豆交易不多，市呈定勢。芝蔴酌見加砌，生仁價格，亦鮮上落。</p>
<p>食油挫跌，生豆油到貨蟬聯，實銷呆滯，供應超過市需，價格下降。豆油開市後即跌七八萬元，除大有餘廠豆油開二百八十二萬外，其他各廠均二百八十萬元，後市轉定。生油略小五萬，市勢較豆油爲堅。江北及靑島吉桶生油，各開三百二十萬，較上週六跌五萬元。桶熟菜油降落十萬，生菜油略挫五萬，吉桶小車蔴油三百十五萬成交，亦降十萬元。豆餅價格幾無上落。</p>
<h3>期糖初跌後</h3>
<p>昨糖市因銀緊關係，期貨合糖一致回小，即土糖號盤亦無不回小。</p>
<p>公會劃盤，現貨二四粗白一百七十五萬兀至七十二萬兀，次一百七十萬兀至六十七萬兀·二〇中砂白一百七十二萬兀至六十五萬元。</p>
<p>台赤二百萬兀至二百十五萬元，四半白一百七十一萬兀至六十五萬元，草包貨一百六十二萬兀至六十萬元。</p>
<p>台靑一百四十萬兀，期貨粗白車白上落達五六萬兀，午後回好二三萬元。</p>
<p>土糖提靑開一百六十萬兀，海南赤一百六十五萬元，興化白一百七十二萬兀至七十萬兀，　一百六十三五萬元。</p>
<h3>茶市交易不多</h3>
<p>茶市漲風，自連綿擴展以來，因所升頗多，致昨日市上，賣戶居奇扳售之念，雖仍迭茁不戢，但進購者則嫌價高昂，態度咸取觀望。</p>
<p>昨全日經過情形，交易並不比上週活躍生色，而潛勢則靜中見硬。價格方面以貨品參差不一，是以缺乏顯著晉級，惟脚地堪稱鞏固。</p>
<h3>捲烟初堅後挫</h3>
<p>昨日捲菸市况，初開買戶乘低吸收，實銷抵補甚殷，行情迂迴上升。午後因有派貨消息，同業頭寸軋緊，逢高吐售頗多。故最後十支大英老刀兩烟，比週末續跌十萬至卅萬元。此外中外各烟則亦降多升少。</p>
<p>肥皂平疲</p>
<p>日用品肥皂市面，因固本派額减少，同業吸胃加强，浮空抵補甚亟，新買亦來活動，結果固本皂較週末回揚五千元，箭刀軋低二萬元，黃祥茂軋升一萬，其餘平疲。火柴老雜牌均小十萬元。火油洋燭市呈俏秀。</p>
<h3>呢絨客銷不振</h3>
<p>往年今日，客帮需銷呢絨，秋冬貨雖已落令，而春季各貨則多接連而來，目下情况不同，遠近諸客帮，俱少進胃，推其主要原因，以申市行情上漲甚烈，大多數俱成倒掛。其次內亂未平，交通有礙，匯款與貼水具有關係。至吃本重，利息高，公私繳用浩大，營業困難，亦爲重大因素。</p>
<h3>國藥存稀價升</h3>
<p>國藥近頗見轉機，以牛莊天津四川各貨大都上升，原因爲各處批發商存底薄弱，來客搜辦，申存亦稀，來路不暢，形成求過於供之狀，後市仍有上揚之勢。若到新春紅聲時期，市況當更能看高。</p>
<p>近市楓肉突跳四萬四，市場　辦。連翹每祖二百八十萬，漲勢甚勁。萊陽參申市大把市一千八百萬，尚稱活躍，小把無市。</p>

<h3>說「誠」</h3>
<p>— 不黨</p>
<p>「誠」之體</p>
<p>朱子曰：「中庸何爲血作也，子思子憂道之失其傳而作也」（中庸章句序）。夫中庸一篇，果出於聖孫子思乎，吾不暇辨，案其內容，則秦漢之交儒者所作，其意在傳其宗師孔子之道，固無疑也。蓋儒家思想至是已臻極備，其徒舉其系統之全筆之於書，以　後世。故其書以天道始，以敎化終；凡所涉之問題，若本體論，若宇宙觀，若倫理·政治·敎育，往往見其理極，開後世之先河。而綜其所道，一以「誠」貫之，故「誠」者，全篇之大經，明乎此，則斯篇之義思過半矣。不揣譾陋，彙其言「誠」之語，發厥義蘊，以質學者。</p>
<p>「者天之道也。」天地之道莫非眞理，然則「誠」者，眞理而已。是之眞理，人之所可得而知，所可得而行者也。是以繼之則曰：「誠之者，人之道也。」「誠之，」猶云求眞理也。非惟求之而巳，舉凡思慮云爲亦皆以之爲準，是乃爲人之方，故曰「人之道也。」眞理出於天，以人而能知之準之，蓋緣其與萬事萬物所率循之道，即此所謂眞理者，同其源焉。天道莫非眞理，人之思慮云爲，物之動靜成毀，固皆天道之所包，輒亦眞理之一部，是天人合一，民物同體。夫人之所以能知天地萬物者，正坐大地人物原屬一體。此乃知識發生之根基，存立之關鍵，歷代儒家之所默契者也。</p>
<p>人道出於天道，人道之一誠　源於天道之「誠」，則倫理·政治·敎育，天道之行於人事，天道之「誠」之見於人事者耳。儒者所謂「一貫」之道，其在斯乎？</p>
<p>然則大道之「誠」奚自來乎？曰：「誠者，自成也；而道，自道也。」「誠者自成」，猶言　理自爲眞理，自致其然，而莫成使之然也。此就天地之道之本然處言，靜方面也。繼而日「道自道」，乃就其發動流行處言，動万面也。「自道」云者，謂其發動流行，自然而然，非此道之外，別有物焉張主左右乎其間也。蓋天道若「誠」，乃萬事萬物　率循而不墜之秩序，此即宇宙之本體，其發動流行純出自然。宇宙萬物一本於自然，其動靜成毀一循自然之法則，非有超自然之主宰，張其造化之機於開闢之前，持其演化之柄於開闢之後也。必云有主宰在，則無寗謂其即存宇宙萬物之中，宇宙萬物爲其形迹；所謂「道」者，乃其自創自守，自然血不得不然之律令已。於斯可見，吾儒之本體觀宇宙觀，與西洋之自然論（Natuvalism）泛神論（Panthelsm）差近。至其人生觀重樂天安命，則目然與泛神之本體觀宇宙觀之所致，又與西洋之定命　（Determiuism）冋符矣。</p>
<p>「誠」者本體，本體發動流行而成宇宙萬物，故曰：「誠者物之終始，不誠無物。」蓋「誠　」，天地之至道定理。物之所以爲物，莫不　受天地之至道定理，以爲其條理界域，故曰：「不誠無物」。且夫物之成也，有其所以成之故：其毀也，亦有其所以毀之因；其故其因無非天地之至通定理，故日：「誠者物之終始」。</p>
<p>「誠」之在人爲性爲德，全其德性則成人，展其德性以及物則成物。中庸有曰：「誠者非自成己而已也，所以成物也。成己，仁也；成物，知也；性之德也。」天道之「誠」賦於人而爲性爲德；德者，人之所以爲人，德有虧，不能成人。「誠者」猶言「誠之者」，求誠立誠之謂也。求誠，所以識天地之道理，藉知已身所得於此道此理之分量如何；立　，所以保其所受於天而爲人者，俾於分量無稍虧缺。茍能如是，自成其爲人矣。顯物與我皆天地所生，猶兄弟然。兄弟同父母，小體之分也，物我同天地，大我之判也；物我之相須而存，正猶兄弟之互依爲命。然則旣成己矣，亦必有以成物，故曰：「非自成己而已　，所以成物也。」成己，則爲人矣；仁者，人之德；故曰「成己，仁也。」欲成物，必推已及物，其事乃在知己之性，知物之情，則知尚焉，故曰；「成物，知也。」仁與知，得於天存於性而爲德者，故曰：「性之德也」。</p>
<h3>實驗與觀察</h3>
<p>— 陳立</p>
<p>在本刋第一期論「今古科學的分野」中，提及過實驗在今科學中之重要，但因篇幅關係，語焉不詳，茲特補加幾句話，但仍祇能講到實驗之精神的一點。</p>
<p>實驗是有所爲而爲的，與無所爲而爲的觀察不同。實驗一定要先有假設，這個假設便是用來解決某一問題的。實驗就是安排一些條件來證實這一假設行得通否。在實驗者的心目中，這個假設是可以解決這一個問題的有時候科學家也會用反證的方法，即用「行不通」來證實一個假設，但意義並沒有大區別。科學的精神便在乎不自認個人的懸想爲是，他肯低頭叩間自然求解答。但「天何言哉」？自然便像不會說話的啞子。你問它，它祇會作「是」或「非」的手勢，不然，便手足亂舞，不知所云。換言之，科學家必安排一些條件，使結果「非此必彼」，亦即科學中所說的抉擇的試騐Crucial　Tet。因此實騐便好像一種對話，人與自然的對話。古科學——如希臘的哲學——則是人與人的對話。</p>
<p>我們將實騐比着一種對話，很可以顯　實騐的特別精神。實騐不是人類一方面的行爲，亦不是自然一方面的行爲——不是純邏輯的推論，亦不是純經騐的事實。我們詰問自然，這是人的主動，亦即實騐的主觀性。但問題發出以後，我們便祇好坐候自然的回答，在這裏人便無能有爲，這便是實騐的客觀性。實騐實在是主觀與客觀的統一，有些人專看車主觀或客觀的一面，這顯然是沒有體會到今科學方法的精髓</p>
<p>科學在過去曾被譯為格致。格物致知之說可以算是中國的古科學。王陽明的格竹子故事是一個很好的例子。他的門人和他曾對着竹子三天七天的發獃，求能格出一些物理來，結果徒弄得體疲力盡而仍無所悟。原因即由於太執着於客觀，想不發問而希望自然會說話。「即物而窮其理」，「即物」如祇指「對物發獃」，這是消極的靜候，而不是積極的詰問，這使不是對話，這祗是獨角戲。可憐的是這獨角戲的主角是一個啞巴——無言的自然。這樣的戲怎會唱得成功呢？陽明學派眼看如此的戲不會成功，便來一個一百八十度的大轉彎，倡「心即理」，或說「我即自然」。如此，自吹自擂，自問自答，人與自然的對話，變成一個人的自語，這與古希臘　對話，精神是一致的。相臘哲學人的對話，形式上是人與人的辯論，事實上，仍是個人的自言自語。從這一個角度看來，古科學，不問中西，都是個人的對話。今古科學的分野，於此顯然。</p>
<p>陸王學派的毛病在太趨極端，因之自己陷於困難。起初，一味觀察，沒有問題，結果沒有答案——這是陷於純客觀的泥淖中。以後，　完全自問自答——這便陷於主觀的幻想中。科學家要如易卜生所說的「我不作答，我的工作是在發問」。觀察的毛病在這裏便暴露出來。觀察或者是無所爲而爲的，一般軼事式的記載便是如此的。在記載時是有所爲的，但其所根據的觀察則是無所爲如爲的。正好像一個人在街上　　，偶而看見兩個人在打架，他因好奇去望了一望，隨即走開了。第二天，他便被人傳去法庭作證。法官問他一些特殊的問題，他盡他的記憶，憑着良心作答，但他的見證有多少可靠？心理學告訴我們，很少可靠。所以觀察的材料往往不是很好的根據。再則觀察即使是有所爲而爲的，但也常常不能得着很精確的道理，原因是觀察常常不能強迫自然作一定的答語。它不能安排條件使自然作斬釘截鐵的回答。自然作一定的答語。它不能安排條件使自然作斬釘截鐵的回答。自然在如此情形下，答案常是糢稜的。有許多人便因爲自然答案的含糊，竟主張不用觀察。這是等於西諺所云：「因嫌水髒，便連小孩帶水都傾出盆外去」，換句話說，不是觀察不對，而是不精密的觀察不對。實際上，實驗仍是觀察——條件控制下的觀察。因此我們說，古科學亦用觀察，這是指廣義的觀察。今科學的觀察，便是實騐的觀察，亦可說是狹義的觀察。觀察的這種分別，十足說明今古科學的甫要差異。</p>
<h3>聯敎組織的第一年</h3>
<p>— 王承緒</p>
<p>聯合國敎育科學文化組織（unesco　簡稱聯敎組織）剛在墨西縣城舉行了它第二次的大會，這個新興的國際　構，從它的孕育以至誕生，作者是知之極深的，前年十一月在巴黎舉行第一次大會時，作者也在凱旋門附近的它的老家，參與它初生第一年內的事業計劃。</p>
<p>聯敎組織的成立，已整整一年多了，它爲建築世界堡壘而生，它的許冬支特者，對它懷着莫大的希望，因此，所定下的事業計劃，幾乎是這脆弱的新生兒所難以勝任的。它的每一部門——敎育，自然科學，社會科學，文學藝術，哲學，岡書館和博物館，和大衆傳播——都擬有龐大的計劃，充分地表現著熱切的理想主義。</p>
<p>這個新生兒的看護長是英國科學家赫胥黎，它的保姆都是學騐俱富的專家，在過去一年的首四月，她們體察它的能力，制定了一個比較實際的工作方案，切實地進行。我們且檢討一番它過去一年內的成績。</p>
<p>它的第一件工作是協助受戰禍國家的敎育和文化的復員。它聯絡許多從事敎育復員的國際組織，成立了一個國際敎育善後委員會，它們募到的捐款，已經逹六千萬美元，還有關於實物方面的捐助。它雖然新生，却做了很多事，我們祇能簡單地列舉　件重要的事：</p>
<p>調査十多國的大衆傳播事業——新聞，常影和廣播——它們的一般敎育上的需要和技術上的需要。</p>
<p>在巴黎附近的費佛地方，舉辦各國敎師夏令講習會，為期六星期，參加的是各國教師的代表，用敎育的力量，促進國際的了解。關於敎育的工作，乃是聯敎組織事業的骨幹。它發動了世界基本敎育運動·在這半數是文盲的世界，和平是難期的。在這個運動中，它編輯了一本基本敎育，作實施時的指針。（這書已由作者譯出，商務出版。）去年九月間在南京舉行的基本教育硏究會議，就是它發動的。現正在中國，海地和東非籌辦基本敎育實騐區。和基本敎育運動並進的，還有改革敎科書　運動。搜集各國敎科書，加以分析·研究改進。</p>
<p>派遣科學家至南美·中東和遠東，籌設科學合作館，溝通科學方面的硏究，這遠東的科學合作館，就在中國。</p>
<p>設置獎學金，鼔勵並協助各國學者學術和技術上的硏究。</p>
<p>在巴黎舉行國際戲劇曾議，決定設立國際戲劇硏究所，制定組織法，並分別在各國　設國內委員會，互通聲氣。</p>
<p>協助聯合國人權保障委員會，草擬人權宣言。</p>
<p>出版刋物，傳逹聯教組織的工作實況。</p>
<p>和日內瓦國際教育局等國際性的團體，取得聯絡，互相合作。</p>
<p>著手「　術興教育」和「美術興社會」的調查研究。</p>
<p>進行翻譯世界名著。</p>
<p>以上的幾點，不能常作計劃看，乃是實實在在做的。赫胥黎氏向參加第二次大會的各國代表，感覺自豪地提出這些報告。</p>
<p>在回顯過去之後，接着就得展望一下將來。聯敎組織在它生命過程的第二年，顯備做些什麽事？聯敎組織在大會中提出左列四點：</p>
<p>各國敎育，科學和文化水準的提高，科學是有統一性的人類活動，至於藝術和文化是具有多樣性的。所以，聯敎組織一方面統一並加速科學的研究及其應用，一方面維繫各國文化的獨特性而求相互的了解。</p>
<p>思想的自由流通。這不僅指消極地打破障礙，並積極地使各國樹立情報和發表的機構——書報，雜誌，電影和廣播。</p>

<h3>由哲學到政治</h3>
<p>— 謝幼偉</p>
<p>——羅素自述之三——</p>
<p>英哲羅　（bertrand　Russell）的馳名世界，似乎不在他的數學，不在他的哲學，而在他的政治活動和政治思想。他不是修道院內的　人。他不想僅在象牙塔內來談他的哲學。他是有濃厚的政治興趣的。他生長在富有政治氣味的家庭內，而他的長輩又都希望他從事政治的活動。這對於他當然不能不有多少影響。所以在他的自述裏，羅素便由哲學談到政治以及敎育等問題。</p>
<p>羅素自認爲他的政治興趣僅次於　學興趣。他雖選擇了哲學爲其主要工作，他却未能完令忘情政治。一八九五年，當他在柏林的時候，他曾細心硏究德國的社會民主政治。他喜歡這種政治主張，以其反對德國的皇帝，然又不喜歡之，則以其把馬克思的正統學說結合於其中的緣故。有一個時期，他受到域比氏（Sicney　Webb）的影響，他是一個帝國主義者，甚而擁護英國的殖民戰爭。不過，到一九〇一年的時候，這種帝國主義的思想他却完全拋棄了。自此以後，他非常不喜歡運用武力去解決人與人間的糾紛，雖然他認爲有時候運用武力是必要的。一九〇三年約瑟夫·張伯倫（Joseph　Chemberlain）反對自由貿易，羅素即站在國際主義者的立塲上去反對張氏。他又曾積極參加爲婦女爭取選舉權的運動。一九一〇年他有意參加國會議員的競選，可是被提名委員會發覺他是自由思想者時，這事便不成功了。</p>
<p>當第一次歐洲大戰發生時，羅素是一個反戰主義者·他的反戰言論和文字頗爲英政府所不滿。他卒因此而一度下獄，同時他也即因此而普遍地爲世人所知。在戰時他頗希望這一次的歐戰可終止將米的戰爭，但凡爾賽條約結訂後，他知道道是沒有希望了。羅氏的朋友頗多同情蘇聯的，惟一九二〇年他到蘇聯之後，他却發覺蘇聯絕無可使他歡喜或崇拜之處。他說：「我覺得鮑爾希維克的　學非常不　　，還不是因爲牠共產主義，而是因爲牠分享了西方財鉅子　　　　　素之故。」他被邀來　，在　國住了差不多一年。他對我國的印象是很好的。他說：「我愛中國人，但中國人反抗敵意的武力主義之結果，顯然必破壞了許多他們文化上之　作者。他們似乎除了被克服或效　他們的敵人的許多惡事外，即沒有他路可走。不過，中國却教訓了我一件事，而這是凡以靈敏的同情研究中國　西洋人都可以獲得的。中國教訓我從較長久的時間上着想，而不爲當前　惡劣環境　到絕望。在　去二十年的黑暗旅程中，這種習慣帮助我把这世界　成爲較可忍受的。」他似乎從中國人方面學到了忍受現狀的習慣。</p>
<p>從中國冋英後，羅素有了兩個孩子。以後他便對敎育發生興趣。關於敎育，他的主張是，以設法使兒童快樂爲重要，而不必有過嚴格的限制。他不是完全主張自由放任的。他認爲强力的運用，在敎育上一如在政治上，有時是必要的。問題是程度之差而已。惟我們若能使兒童快樂，則强力的運用即可减少到最低限。</p>
<p>晚年羅素對於歷史也發生興趣。他的歷史觀和馬克思不同。拿哲學來說，馬克思只承認哲學是社會情况的結果，而不承認哲學也是社會情况的原因。道是羅氏所不同意的。羅氏認爲哲學是結果，也是原因。柏拉圖的哲學是希臘社會的結果，也是中古基督敎神學的原因。若僅承誌前者而不承認後者，則中古敎會的長成便無法解釋，他最近地部「西洋哲學史」便是站在這種觀點上寫成的。</p>
<p>羅素現仍健在。他雖近八十歲的年齡，尚沒有停止他的寫作。他仍是今日思想界上的一顆明星。</p>
<h3>學林叢話（六）</h3>
<p>— 張其昀</p>
<p>世界政府的途徑</p>
<p>近來學者鑒於過去國聯之失敗，與現在聯合國力量恐不足以弭戰，主張就現行美國聯邦制擴面充之，創立世界政府。將來世界各國之地位當如美國之四十八州，以目前國家主權之一部分授於各國共戴之世界政府。此種理想何時實現自未能逆覩，但著書討論者已頗不乏人，英國劍橋大學著名哲學家艾溫博士（A.C.　Ewing）所著「個人國家與世界政府」一書（一九四七年紐約麥美倫書局出版），即爲其例。此中問題　多，就其大者言之，一爲世界議會之問題。代表如何產生？如以人口計算，中國與印度二國幾佔世界人類之半數。如以財富，工業生產力，國際貿易等爲基礎，亦甚難尋得一公認之標準。二爲各國主權中究竟那幾項應該加以限制。諸如關稅之廢止，國際幣制之統一，若干稀有原料之控制以及世界公民權利義務如何規定，必須有合理而具體之辦法，方能達到建立世界政府之目的。艾溫博士承英國功利派之流風，認爲個人的享有之權利，應以與公衆有益者爲其尺度。國家享有的主權，亦應以與人類全體有益者爲其尺度。現在聯合國各大國享有之否決權之存廢，實爲世界政府能否成立之先決問題。</p>
<p>聯合國憲章閒宗明義第一章，叙述聯合國之旨趣，在於維護和平與安全，採取集體方法以防止與消弭對於和平之威脅，並制止侵害之行爲。但聯合國大會之職務，僅限於討論與建議，不能直接行動，最多不過由大會派遣一考察團，如最近之巴勒斯坦問題是。至於保全希臘領土完整等事，大會不能有所舉動。聯合國之事權乃集中於安全理事會。一九四五年六月一日聯合國大會在舊金山開幕，蘇聯首先提出否決糊問題，以此爲參加聯合國之條件。如果一國遭受外來侵略向安全理事會申訴曲直，蘇聯認爲非得五個永久理事國之全體同意，不能有所決議。二年以來，蘇聯在安全理事會　運川否決權已有十七次之多，此外法國曾經運用過一次，、　蘇兩國聯合運用過一次。目前聯合國可謂暗淡無光，論者多歸咎於美蘇關係之惡化，其原因究竟何在？據美國外交季刋（Foreign　Affeirs）編輯亞姆史脫朗（H.F.Arm　strong）之意，蘇聯在其國境以外廣設傀儡政府，固爲原因之一。在美國人的看法，此事固非必需，但就一九一八年以來國際形勢觀之，未始無若干理由可言。至於蘇聯在安全理事會中動輒運用否決權，實使聯合國成爲一籌莫展之局面。亞氏指出否決權問題爲美蘇交惡之主要原因。欲從聯合國演進到世界政府，亦必自解決這個問題入手。當然大同之路初非一蹴而幾。</p>

<p>自由談</p>
<h3>英雄所見略同</h3>
<p>— 譚正璧</p>
<p>魯迅且介亭雜文二集「題未定」草六，其中有一段談到「選本」的問題，他說：「選本所顯示的，往往並非作者的特色，倒是選者的眼光。眼光愈銳利，見識愈深廣，選本固然愈準確，但可惜的是大抵眼光如豆，抹殺了作者眞相的居多，……如被選家錄取了「歸去來辭」和「桃花源記」，被論客讚賞羨「采菊東籬下，悠然見南山」的陶潛先生，在後人的心目中，實在飄飄得太久了，但在全集裏，……除論客所佩服的「悠然見南山」之外，也還有「精衛銜微木，將以塡滄海，刑天舞干戚，猛志固常在」之類的「全剛怒目」式，在證明他並非整天整夜的飄飄然。這「猛志固常在」，「悠然見南山」的是一個人，倘有取捨，即非全人，再加抑揚，更離眞實？……」這一段非常警策的議論，當時讀了，便以爲是魯迅自己的見解，所以在我戰後改編的「中國文學史大綱」裏便引了進去，而譽爲這是魯迅眼光獨到。</p>
<p>後來偶讀「困學紀聞」，才知宋人早已先有此說，而在魯迅，不過是和古人「英雄所見略同」，而在我却成爲「數典忘祇」。「困學紀聞」，是部偏于考據一面的讀書筆記，作者是南宋有名的史地學家王應麟。卷十八評詩有一條云：「陶靖節之「讀山海經」，猶屈子之賦「遠遊」也，「精衛銜微木，將以塡滄海，刑天舞干戚，猛志固常在，」悲痛之深，可爲流涕。」道條和魯迅所說，完全相同。翁元圻的注又引眞西山的「跋黃瀛甫擬陶詩」云：「　明　　王室，　有乃　长沙公之心，獨以力不得　，故肥　以自絕，食薇飲水之言，銜公是指　明的　　陶侃。他是晋朝一位擎天的英雄，曾先後討平國內許多叛亂，官至侍中太尉，軍事，拜大將軍。可見是位風雲際會的人物。他的朝　運　的故事，又為　動家所樂道。真西山說　明有著陶侃那樣的雄志，實是石破天驚之論。他雖是一位理學家，能夠這樣的常識　明，勝於同時朱熹們那樣的迂儒萬倍。而他的說法，又比王應麟和魯迅更進一層。</p>
<p>因此我悟到亡師朱香晚先生的主見，他一生講學，但堅持「述而不作」的宗旨，以爲我之所見，自以爲獨得，往往已被古人說過，所以寗述不作。當時在敎室裏聽他講這話時，私心頗以爲太迂執。現在有了這樣一件事，從知英雄儘可所見略同，而數典却不可以忘祖，「作」確不是一件容晚的事。一代學者所發的議論，未必沒有不是前代的人已經說過的，倘然出于一個平常人的筆下，便要詆爲剿襲陳言了。然則同一「所見略同」，也還是有幸有不幸的。</p>
<h3>忘本</h3>
<p>— 王百里</p>
<p>稱「言行相符」的人爲君子，這句話我實在不敢贊同。原因是：言行相符，本來是每個人分內的事，以一個人分內應行的事，而尚加之以贊美的名稱—君子，那人人都是君子了，這樣的所謂君子，尚何希奇之有—有的人說，因爲人人都是君子，便覺得君子不希奇，於是就有「聰明」的人，想出言違其行或是行違其言的新標題，來改革固有的「陋習」，果然也有人仿效，弄到結果，人世間熙熙攘攘，便祗有言行相違的人了，因此，便又以爲守着本分的人是希奇。物以希爲貴，所以又稱言行相符的人爲君子了。這種說法，雖然有些詼諧或者說是帶些諷刺的成分，但仔細想來，却很有道理。這與現在廣告上「品質始終如一」的話，大致相同；本來「品質始終如一」，乃是廠家出品分內的事，天經地義，無足爲奇，而這裏所謂「品質始終如工」，好像是說明一般的廠家，其初出品時的質料，原是上乘，到後來聲譽稍起，便偷工减料而變爲次貨，做廣告的人不知是有意開玩笑或是怎樣，給一般廠家下一個「幽默」的注脚，以爲出品的逐漸變質是廠家應有的過程似的，所以做廣告時特別標出「品質始終如一」以相號召，認為唯此：出品的變質好像是本分，而「始終如一」卻反是獨特的了。還豈不是忘記了本分嗎？其實「品質始終如一」，在今日的廠家之中，又何嘗不是鳳毛麟角呢！</p>
<p>上述兩事，與南史宋書袁粲傳中有一段話近似，該傳中略云：粲淸整有風操，嘗謂人曰：「者有一國，國中一水，號日狂泉，國人飲此水，無不狂者，惟國君穿井而　，獨無恙。國人旣並狂，而反謂國君之不狂爲狂，於是相與聚謀，共執國君，療其狂疾，火艾針　，莫不畢具，國君不勝其苦，亦到泉所，酌水飲之，飲畢便狂，於是君臣大小，其狂若一，衆乃懽然。今我不狂，難以獨立，比亦欲飲此泉焉！」還之，眞令人哭笑不得。袁公以爲飲「狂泉」，其人必狂，我聞廣州有「貪泉」（？）（見同書范柏年傳），飲之亦必令人貪，今日國人貪污之風甚熾，其亦飲此「貪泉」所致乎！又不禁令人感概係之！</p>
<h3>岳飛之死傳說不一</h3>
<p>— 鄭過宜</p>
<p>岳鄂王之斃於獄，宋史不明　其所以死，僅云：「秦檜書小紙付獄吏，即報云：飛死矣。」流俗習聞岳傳演義所述，皆謂飛與子雲及張憲。併縊死於風波亭，此無根之談也。風波亭事見諸堅瓠集云：「岳武穆班師過金山寺，禪師道月勸之勿赴關，武穆不聽，道月遺以詩日：風波亭下水滔滔，千万堅心把舵牢，祇恐同行人意歹，將身推落在深濤。武穆至臨安，繫大理獄，有亭扁曰風波，始悟詩意，悔不從其言。」以上殆出小說附會，未必果有其事，然亦無被縊之說也。</p>
<p>余嘗彙考載籍，於飛之一死，傳聞各異，茲分別志之於次，亦足以資談助焉。朝野遺記云：「岳飛之斃於浴也，實請具浴拉脅而姐，獄卒隗順負其屍出葬於北山之　。」此言其具浴拉脅而殂也。林泉野記云：「秦檜諷臣僚言飛不援淮西，以少保武勝定國軍節度使醴泉觀使罷。頃之，統制張憲謀亂，冀朝廷還飛，而已爲副統制。王俊發其奸，張俊亦以爲言，檜因謂飛令其子雲作書與憲，下飛大理寺，命御史中丞万俟　訊鞫，歸罪雲憲坐斬，並賜飛死。」此則飛實賜死，又飛雖無罪，而張憲乃有謀亂之迹也。三朝北盟會編云：「癸已，飛死於獄中，梟其首，市人聞之，悽愴有下淚。」此雖亦不明言其所以一死，然謂之梟首，則是飛死後且遭斷顯之慘也。岳侯傳云：「紹興十年冬十二月二十七日，侯中毒而死，葬於臨安菜園中，天下聞者無不埀涕，下至三尺童子皆怨秦檜云。」此又謂飛爲中毒而死也。綜上諸說，言飛死狀無一相同，是當時之人於飛之死，亦多昧其眞相所知。（上引各書，胥宋人所撰。）宋史之不明言飛何以死，蓋亦難於適從耳。余意謂賜死一說，或可取信，緣高宗之欲殺飛，積之已非一日正毋庸爲之諱，而使秦檜獨承其罪也。自岳傳演義出，於是又平添縊斃一說，而不復更知有「拉脅」「賜死」「梟首」「毒死」種種異聞，委巷野語，其力之大如此，不亦可怪之至！</p>
<h3>咖啡館內</h3>
<p>— 毛毅</p>
<p>新近曾到紐約的一家小咖啡館內開坐，來了一個漂亮的女郎，堂倌頭見把她安置在我的隔壁的檯子。我打量起這個新來者，她所穿的是每一個人的太太都喜歡穿的衣服。</p>
<p>在豆腐乾大小的舞池的那一邊，我注意到一個整潔的紳士正在分享我的對那個女郎的關切。當她朝他那一邊望去的時候，他對她笑了起來。那個「無主的」女士也向他回笑。那紳士站起身來，走出到帳房問去。片刻之後他又回來了，手中拿了一束玻璃紙包裏的蘭花。這個偽君子在一張一菜單的反面寫了一些東西，然後差一個堂倌把菜單和蘭花一全送給那女士。她讀了菜單反面的字句之後，對發件者傳過去一陣允諾的微笑。於是，那紳士走向她的儓子來，鞠躬如也，自我介紹一番，便坐了下來</p>
<p>我聽到他對她說，「獨個兒吃飯是沒有多大興味的。你允許我點一些酒嗎？」</p>
<p>我看到堂倌頭兒伺候着這一對，等了一會，就走開去了。</p>
<p>「我在城中看見過你多次」，男的繼續說。</p>
<p>女的微笑起來。</p>
<p>堂倌拿了酒來，拔去塞子。「一九二六年釀造的」，男的說。</p>
<p>樂隊奏起樂來，那紳士站了起來，又是鞠躬如也，微詢他的女侶是否願意跳舞。我承認他倆在舞池中是很好的一對。在我出去的時候，我掠過堂倌頭兒。「這是怎麽回事」？我對他說道，「你看到剛才發生的事情吧」！</p>
<p>他微笑起來。「這件事進行了長久了。」他說。「那位紳士是柯定頓先生，在過去的十一年中，每逢到十月裏的這一天的晚上，他和那位女士便到這個咖啡館來，重覆的表演相同的一幕。自從他在一九三六年第一次在這裏看中了她，他們就一直如此做。他倆總是定好同一的檯子。有一次，我問他這是甚麼道理。他告訴我說這使他們兩人都得以保持年靑。」</p>
<p>「那位女士是誰？」我問道</p>
<p>堂倌頭兒裂開了嘴巴。「她就是柯定頓夫人。」</p>
<h3>主僕之間</h3>
<p>— 陳湘</p>
<p>最近從日本　斬美國　影記者約翰·福洛利亞講起了一件關於他的僕人的故事。</p>
<p>典型的東方習俗，僕人是不願意用任何的方式打擾他的主人的安靜的。有一次，福洛利亞在安息之前叮囑他的僕人在次晨七時正務必喚醒他，因爲他有一個重要的約會。</p>
<p>第二天早晨，僕人輕脚躡足，悄悄的掩了進來，小心的在牀側放了一張紙條，又悄悄的退了出去。當福洛利亞醒來的時候，已是時近中午了。他看到紙條，拿起來讀道：「福洛利亞先生，現在是七點鐘了。淸醒來罷。」</p>
<h3>斤斤較量</h3>
<p>— 寄漠</p>
<p>生平不歡喜跟人家斤斤較量。筆者從銀行取出現鈔時，不論多至數百萬元，少至數千萬元，從來沒有逐張點數，成疊的塞在衣袋內，其問自然不免有缺少情事，但是因爲數屬微細，也就隨它算了。</p>
<p>可是涉世較深，在商業社會巾與人家發生接觸時，却就吃了不肯斤斤較量的大虧，假定足下替某甲來回奔走，　進一筆貨物，很花費不少工夫，等到事成之後，也許某甲請你吃了一次飯，就是很平常的上餐館隨便點幾個菜，如果你一時臉嫩說：「不　願意替閣下義務當値，用不到酬勞。」對方也許竟會說：「那末，承情之至，我們就交個朋友吧。」你回想到接治時的奔波之勞，頓時有啼笑皆非之感。</p>
<p>華者有一位朋友，興我有同樣的脾氣，此公也愛和　墨結不解緣。某次當代友人主編一張副刊，逢到缺稿時，還得親自動筆，一月總要寫上十餘篇，約有二·三萬字。如是者二月，滿以爲代編期滿，友人定有相當酬勞，誰知道友人以報館開支不敷推托，結果此公竟分文未着。事實上，十個文人中總有九個是心平氣和的，只要你略給酬報，決不會較量，可是往往連這最低的潤筆，也不能到手，不免使職業作家們，望「硯」興嘆了。</p>
<p>我還記得今年歲首，本欄會登過一恭喜發財的文章，對孔子口罕言利，而心中也許希望發財的心理，剖析甚詳，但是此文對於如何發財，却隻字未提，拙稿可以替此文下一轉語，斤斤較量也許正是發財的一條門徑呢。</p>
<h3>家事與治家</h3>
<p>— 津津</p>
<p>我國一般士大夫，對於管理家務有一套傳統的看法，認爲治家是要興「齊國」，「平天下」相提並論的。肉割得公平，也許竟是異日榮爲宰相的條件。因此，負治家之責的，縱使不懂得那些天道理，至少朱子家訓總要讀過一通的，好在這篇文章極易找到。眞正找不到的話，你去買一錠朱子家訓的墨來，也能滿足你暢　為快的願望。</p>
<p>然而這樣一來，對於眞真的家事，却不免相去日遠，例如怎樣煮肉，才會味美可口，吃掉乳粉或咖啡的空罐，如何利用等，在講究那些大道理之餘，似乎不暇兼顧了。因此，最近　者在一本美國西部家庭雜誌，讀到Housewives’Notebook一欄時，覺得這一個專題，不易譯成華交。倘使譯為主婦札餯，我國家庭中似乎根本沒有這麼一會事。反之，倘使譯成治家　記，似又太正經了。因爲該欄的內容，不過記些「黃褐色或黑色桌子，有白色劃紋時，可塗以同色的皮鞋油」之類罷了。</p>
<p>我常常覺得家務逃不掉那些日常的瑣屑事務，如果眞要處處附會那些好高務遠的道理，也許「家」沒有「治」好，家事先弄得一團糟了。</p>
<h3>兩個顧亭林</h3>
<p>— 兪劍華</p>
<p>在明末有兩位顯亭林，一較早，一較晚。較早的一位是畫家，較晚的一位是學者。現在將他們二位的略傳，記在下面：</p>
<p>顧正誼，明華亭人，字仲方，號亭林，萬膠時仕爲中書舍人，善山水，宗大痴，家多名蹟，又與嘉興宋旭，同郡孫克弘友善，窮探旨趣，遂自名家。山多作方頂，層蠻疊嶂，少着林樹，自然　秀，是爲華亭派。—見王穉登撰顧亭林傳，明史藝文志，蘇州府志，松江志，明畫錄，無聲詩史，畫史會要，圖繪寶鑑續纂，莫廷韓集，容合集，畫史彙傳，畫獻人名大辭典，中國人名大辭典等書。</p>
<p>顯炎武，淸初崑山人，生於明萬　間，初名絳，字寗人，號亭林，耿介絕俗，興同里歸莊　，有歸奇顧怪之目。魯王時，與莊起兵勤王，官兵部職方郎中，兵敗得脫，入淸改名炎武，屢徽不起，周遊四方，　懷故國，數謁明陵，後卒於華陰。炎武學宗程朱，篤志六經，旁涉國家典制，郡邑掌故，以及天文，儀象，兵農，河漕之屬，專務歛華就實，探究原委，晚年精研老證，兼嗜金石，著有日知錄，天下郡國利病書等數十種。—見辭源，辭海，及中國人名大辭典等書。</p>
<p>由此看來，顯炎武固然是鼎鼎大名的學者，但顯正誼也並非無名小卒，而且是董莫昌的畫師。明代學黃子久的很少，正誼却專學子久，所以董其昌也學子久，以後四王吳惲的崇拜子久，造成淸朝一代畫風，都可以說導源於正誼。硏究靈史的人似乎對於這位人物，不能熟視無睹。但是因爲號亭林的原故，兩位亭林時代又相差不遠，於是不免混淆不淸，有人就鬧出笑話來了。</p>
<p>第一位是淸末葉德輝先生，所著有郁園書畫記，消夏　一詩，觀　百詠等書，陸廉夫序其觀畫百詠，稱其「神　別，富收藏，書籍圖畫，乃其癖好，盡見內府所藏法書名畫，得知晉書以來六法淵源，及元明至今南北二宗分合變化之迹。」現在看他所撰的觀畫百詠，上下千古，眼光之高，見解之超，記誦之富，眼界之廣，誠有如廉夫所稱者，但在第九十九首註中，却有「顧亭林絳仿雲林小景一，以爲「古來文興人到而作，亦足名世。」我想這幅畫一定是顯正誼的亭林，而不是顧絳的亭林。</p>
<p>第二位是現代龍游余紹宋前輩。所著有畫法要錄一二集，書畫書錄解題等書，收羅之廣，閱讀之富，眼光之精，評　之當，允稱千古絕作，沾漑後學，裨益畫道，實非淺鮮，但是對於顧亭林亦不免誤會。他的書畫分錄解題朱臥菴藏書　　下云：</p>
<p>「…又編中有顯亭林仿黃子久山水一種，顧畫已可疑，而下注云：陳眉公跋。考眉公卒於崇幀十二年，年九十歲，亭線生於萬曆四十一年，眉公卒時，亭林方二十歲，當無爲其題畫之事。舉此一端，知此編未可深信，姑列此俟再考。」這顯然是把顯炎武當成顯正誼，正誼是學子久的，有何可疑？眉公卒於崇禎十二年，為生於萬　年間的學者顧亭林題畫似乎不可能，但爲在萬曆年問做中書舍人畫冢顧亭林題畫，有何不可能？</p>
<p>普通人弄錯了，還有可說，葉余二先生是多閱古今畫蹟，讀遍天下畫史的專家，竟然也不免有此遺誤，眞可謂智者千慮之一失，更可以見學問之道，無窮無盡，一毫大意不得。</p>
<p>因此我又想起本人的名字相同的也很多，呌劍華的男女都有，據我所知至少已有十人以上，呌兪劍華的也有三個。一位是我，一位是太倉的，他比我大幾歲，是南社健將，詩詞名家，我於民國十七十九兩年曾到太倉去訪過他，我們還同拍過一張照。他不會作畫，我却也不會作詩。另外一位聽說是上海商學院的學生。雖然同名的已有三個，（實際上一定不止此數）這比十五個吳國楨却差遠了。</p>
<h3>逍遥花</h3>
<p>— 陳慎言</p>
<p>第八章　功敗垂成（四七）</p>
<p>鳳笙一面擦眼淚，一面說了：「人家旣然不要我了，我又何必强要人家要？這樣太沒人格了」。雲卿通：「你這樣負氣一走，更趁了他的心願，不能這樣便宜他」。鳳　道：「人家不要我了，我還有什麽法子」？雲卿道：「你可以提出條件，向他要朮呀！在此危急關頭，你要先發制人，別等他布置好了再發動，輸人一着，便處處吃虧。總之，男子的心是狠的，我們也要硬着心腸和他幹一幹」。鳳笙道：「應該怎樣幹？我家就沒幹過這事」。雲卿道：「渚齋如此居心，是無可挽回的，你就委曲求全數衍一時，早晚總要暴發」。鳳笙道：「這一點我看得很淸楚，我結婚沒有幾天，就看出他對我神氣不對，我早晚擔心，就爲這事」。說着，又流下淚來。雲卿道：「我看這事由他發動，不如由你先發動，我們提出幾個條件，先站了地位，然後靜看他如何演變」。鳳笙道：「提出什麼條件呢」？雲卿道：「你斟酌着，如何於你有利，便如何提出」。鳳笙遲疑一會道：「我看這時代，金錢第一，我呌他把所有的產業，分給我一半」。雲卿道：「你這頭一條，就是失敗。你要知道，渚齋家裏是有產業，可是他的產業，都在他父親手裏，他支配不動，你提出這條件，他無法答應。你要提出他能辦得到的條件，他才能履行呀」！鳳笙又仰顯想一想道：「他不能把財產分給我，還有什麼條件於我有利呢？你替我想一想，我現在腦筋太不靈了」—雲卿道：「我們先發動，第一要站自己的地位，脚步站穩，就不至吃虧。第一點：當然注重金錢，不過不能要他產業，祇要生活費，供給你一輩子，這種生活費，你可以自動取消而他永遠不能取消的。第二點：要保障，所謂保障就是現在你所住的住宅，以及一切物件，全歸你所有，由你自由支配，渚齋一概不能過問。第三點：要自由，所謂自由就是雙方所訂離婚字據，不必公布，你完全有自由權，你可以取消，他不能取消，留有自由退縮餘地，換句話說，將來你有相當對象，你可以自由行動嫁給他，你沒有滿意的對象，渚齋所擔任你的生活費，永遠沒完。我看且照這條件和渚齋交涉，看他如何」。鳳笙道：「你的主張太好了，這種條件都是和我有利的，祗怕渚齋不肯答應」。</p>

<h3>Meeting Between British Ambassador and Foreign Minister: Kowloon City Case Shows Signs of Progress; Hong Kong's Second Eviction Order Not Implemented</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing dispatch, 19th] After two days of quiet Sino-British negotiations in the capital, activities resumed on the 19th. British Ambassador Sir Ralph Stevenson visited Foreign Minister Wang at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs at 11:00 AM for approximately one hour to discuss the Kowloon City issue and the Shamian incident in Guangzhou. The British Ambassador presented some materials and opinions, but nothing concrete has been decided yet. The outcome of the talks is unknown. However, both sides maintained a very friendly attitude and were sincere in their efforts to prevent the disputes from continuing and to seek a prompt resolution. According to our reporter's investigation, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs had not received any warning from the Kowloon side as of late evening, suggesting that the Hong Kong authorities' plan to forcibly relocate residents on the 19th was not implemented. It is believed that instructions from London may have reached the Hong Kong government, leading to the timely halt of these forced actions. The deadline of the 19th, which had been regarded as a "death sentence" by all parties, was thus eased. An official from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs told our reporter that reports from various parties in Guangzhou regarding the incident were still arriving at the Ministry, and the Ministry had instructed Special Commissioner Guo Dewa on various issues via telegram. Reliable sources indicate that regarding the Kowloon City issue, opinions from negotiations in London and Hong Kong are gradually converging. The ultimate solution will take into account both the current situation and the legal basis, and a new development is expected in the short term. As for the Shamian incident in Guangzhou, the British Embassy has not yet received instructions from the British government, and no clear stance has been expressed. Concerned parties believe that the meeting between the British Ambassador and Foreign Minister Wang on the 19th indicates a greater opportunity for resolving the issues. The Shamian incident has not affected negotiations on the Kowloon City issue, and a resolution to the Kowloon City issue will benefit the aftermath of the Shamian incident, restoring stability to the uneasy situation of recent months. [Central News Agency, Nanjing, 19th] Our reporter learned from authoritative sources that our government had made a formal protest to the British side regarding the Hong Kong government's repeated forced relocation of Kowloon City residents. The British side would not likely ignore this protest. It is also said that Foreign Ministry Special Commissioner Guo Dewa has made necessary explanations to the Kowloon City residents.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Hong Kong, 19th] The Kowloon City issue has not yet been resolved, but well-informed sources are optimistic that senior officials are willing to reach a settlement agreement on this matter soon. The result may be a temporary maintenance of the status quo regarding jurisdiction over the old city of Kowloon, leaving it for future discussions. Inevitably, future discussions will involve the future status of Hong Kong and Kowloon as a whole. At the same time, the residents of the old city of Kowloon are still staying in their original places and have not retreated. The police guarding the area have not interfered, and the police have not interfered with the temporary shelters built by the residents. As for the two resident representatives sentenced to three months of hard labor, they have not yet filed an appeal.</p>
<p>[Our Guangzhou dispatch, 19th] 250 British soldiers suddenly entered Kowloon City at 4:30 AM on the 19th. It is rumored that they were preparing to forcibly relocate the residents of Kowloon City on a large scale, but there had been no action as of 9:00 AM. The residents continued to raise the flag as usual. They stared at the fluttering national flag, to the point of tears. Their grief and indignation can be imagined. In addition, both sides have deployed heavy troops to guard the Guangdong-Hong Kong border to prevent accidents. On the night of the 17th, a group of unstable elements attempted to enter Shenzhen from the Hong Kong side, but they fled after being thwarted by the strict vigilance of the national army. The sudden large-scale increase in British troop deployments to the border at this time has made the situation very tense. Those entering Hong Kong from Guangdong are now subject to strict inspection by the British army.</p>
<h3>Shamian Incident Suspects: Over Seventy Released</h3>
<p>Inaccurate Claim that Youth League Members Prevented Firefighting [Central News Agency, Guangzhou, 19th] Of the hundred or more suspects arrested during the Shamian incident, one-third were students. All of them were handed over to the Garrison Headquarters on the night of the 16th. Since the headquarters did not have detention facilities, they were detained in VIP rooms. They were interrogated separately on the morning of the 17th, and those without evidence of guilt were immediately released on bail. More than 20 people were released on the afternoon of the 17th, and more than 50 people were released on the 18th. It is understood that those whose cases are more serious and require detailed investigation will be released successively as quickly as possible.</p>
<p>[Another dispatch] According to a United Press dispatch on the 17th, some members of the Three People's Principles Youth League wearing uniforms prevented the fire brigade from fighting the fire during the Shamian incident. Guan Zishu, the former director of the Three People's Principles Youth League and the current deputy director of the Provincial Party Headquarters, said that the demolition of houses in Kowloon City and the burning of consulates in Shamian were both unfortunate incidents and regrettable. In particular, it is a pity that the patriotic actions of the Guangzhou people's demonstrations and parades were turned into excessive actions due to the infiltration of conspirators. As for the report that youth league members wearing uniforms prevented the fire brigade from fighting the fire, it is absurd. There has never been a regulation for youth league members to wear uniforms, and since the unification of the party and the league organization, the name of league member has no longer been used externally, and there is no such thing as league members preventing the fire brigade from fighting the fire. This kind of dispatch does not conform to the facts.</p>
<h3>Presidential Election Procedures: Draft Still Under Discussion; National Assembly Preparatory Committee Intensifies Work</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing dispatch, 19th] The work of the National Assembly Preparatory Committee is actively underway. Secretary-General Hong Lan You and others frequently visit the office to prepare for the National Assembly delegates' reception center and the documents required for the registration of each delegate. It is learned that more than ten regulations drafted by the National Assembly Preparatory Committee's second meeting and handed over to the Committee's agenda group have now been completed in their first draft. After passing through the Secretariat's office meeting and then through the Preparatory Committee, they can be finalized. According to a certain person in charge of drafting the documents, the drafting of more than ten kinds of laws and regulations can be explained: regarding the draft election method of the presidium, the rules of procedure, and the format of the National Assembly delegates' oath, there are precedents to follow, and the drafting is easier. However, the presidential and vice-presidential election procedures are unprecedented in our country, so the codes of various democratic countries have been consulted, and the opinions of experts have been solicited to complete the draft. The person continued: In order to draft this chapter, I had previously helped Ambassador Stuart Layton to borrow the American code for reference, but I knew that each democratic country had implemented it for a long time and had customary law, so it was not possible to obtain a good reference for a while. The person also said: It needs to be studied by experts before a decision can be made. The Preparatory Committee attaches great importance to this matter.</p>
<p>[Another dispatch] The reason why the list of elected National Assembly delegates has not been announced is that the issue of mutual concessions among Kuomintang members and the disputes arising from the nomination of the Democratic Socialist Party and the Youth Party without being elected have not been resolved. Chairman Chiang Kai-shek is deeply concerned about this. On the 19th, after the National Father's Memorial Week at the Central Party Headquarters, he summoned Wu Tiecheng to demolish the houses. In addition, the Democratic Socialist Party has sent a special letter to Wu Tiecheng, Zhang Lisheng, and Chen Lifu of the Kuomintang regarding the failure of some party members to be elected, requesting that a joint meeting of the three parties be convened immediately for swift discussion to resolve the issue as soon as possible. [Another dispatch] Forty representatives of the Kuomintang Central Nominated National Assembly Delegates Association went to the Central Party Headquarters on the morning of the 19th to request an audience with President Chiang Kai-shek. They were received by Secretary-General Wu, who said that the National Assembly issue had not been finally decided and that a solution was being studied. During the representatives' petition, they held a white cloth banner with the words "Requesting the implementation of the President's and the Central Committee's orders and the implementation of the National Government's resolutions." It is reported that the association has decided that if the central government does not report its orders and regulations, it will immediately notify members in various provinces and cities to gather in Nanjing before March 10 to attend the National Assembly.</p>
<h3>Election Results of National Assembly Delegates in Shandong Province</h3>
<p>[Our Jinan dispatch, 19th] The results of the election of National Assembly delegates in various counties were announced by the Provincial Election Office for the second time as follows: Yangyi: Kong Fumin, substitute Shi Qing. Boping: Cui Yingru, substitute Wu Dongyang. Linyi: Liu Zhaoxiang, substitute Wang Wenyuan. Jimo: Wang Jingxuan, substitute Yi Qinyao. Shouzhang: Lei Yunzhen, substitute Zhao Yulu.

Wudi: Qiu Yaodong, substitute Han Bangwen. Yixian: Liang Jilu, substitute Chu Bucheng. Leling: He Bingru, substitute Gao Hexuan.</p>
<h3>Election of Legislators: Strict Prevention of Fraud</h3>
<p>The Jiangsu Election Office Orders All Districts to Comply [Our Zhenjiang dispatch, 19th] Wang Maogong, Director of the Jiangsu Provincial Election Office, noted that as the election of legislators has begun, there have been reports of soliciting money under false pretenses. He stated that at the beginning of the implementation of the current constitution, it is the beginning of democratic progress. If uprightness is not upheld, how can the virtuous and capable be elected? He has repeatedly ordered strict rectification from the National Government. All personnel responsible for election affairs must pay close attention at all times, curb corruption, and save the declining customs. The future of election administration depends on this. The office has recently issued special orders to the election offices in various districts to comply. [Our Zhenjiang dispatch, 19th] Today is only one day away from the date of the Jiangsu Province press circles' vote for legislators. According to reports from various counties, Chen Xunchun and Cheng Cangbo, who are campaigning in this province, have already obtained the unanimous support of their colleagues throughout the province. Others, such as Huang Shaogu, Hu Jianzhong, and Chen Bosheng, are also expected to receive a considerable number of votes. The campaign grounds of the press circles in Zhenjiang and Wuxi are full of an atmosphere of friendship and harmony, which is a microcosm of the new China.</p>
<p>[Our Dongtai dispatch, 19th] On the eve of the legislative election, campaign activities here have intensified. Red paper slogans are everywhere on the streets. Zhu Shiqiu and Yu Yifan are the two with higher voices. In addition, the members of the local reporters' association unanimously support Chen Xuncun.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tianjin, 18th] As the legislative election approaches, the candidates in Tianjin have launched a more heated campaign than on the eve of the National Assembly election. The campaign teams of various candidates have been established one after another. Portraits, giant slogans, cartoons, and biographies of the candidates can be seen everywhere on the streets. There are also many who use cars for roving lectures. Guo Zijun, Wang Renyuan, Xu Yunxi, Li Huilin, Zhai Shaohua, and Qi Guoliang are the most active campaigners. Zhou Zhihou, the candidate nominated by the Democratic Socialist Party, has also plastered campaign slogans all over the city. [Central News Agency, Xi'an, 19th] The legislative election campaign here has been launched fiercely and has entered a white-hot stage. The candidates are vying for votes even more enthusiastically than during the last National Assembly election. Campaign slogans have also appeared on the streets.</p>
<h3>National Government Legal System Committee: Discusses Self-Government Guidelines; No Concrete Conclusion Reached on the Issue of Popularly Elected Provincial and County Heads</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing dispatch, 19th] The National Government Committee's Legal System Committee held a meeting at 4:00 PM on the 19th, chaired by Sun Ke, to discuss the provincial and county self-government guidelines. There were two opinions during the meeting. Some people believed that it would not be easy to realize the popular election of provincial and county heads in China, which is currently in the midst of turmoil and military operations, and should be postponed. Others believed that since the president can be elected, the provincial and county heads can certainly be elected. Sun Ke strongly supported this view, believing that popular elections should begin as scheduled. Xu Chuanlin said: Even if it cannot be implemented immediately, it must be completed within a time limit. Zhang Qun believes that the popular election should be carried out only after the provincial areas are reduced. The meeting was very enthusiastic, but no concrete conclusions were reached.</p>
<h3>Zhang Jia'ao Banquets North China Petition Delegation; Northbound Grain Transportation to Increase; Reopening Shanghai Exchange for Industrial Loans No Problem in Principle</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing dispatch, 19th] The North China Petition Delegation and his party visited Wu Yuchang, Secretary-General of the National Government, at 11:00 AM on the 19th to present their petition to the National Government and discuss general matters. Wu promised to report their requests to the President and forward them to the relevant agencies for review. The delegation had lunch with Zhang Jia'ao, and all issues were discussed. The amount of grain transported to the north in principle will be increased, and it is estimated that the total amount of flour for Peiping and Tianjin will be increased to 1.25 million bags. However, this amount is still insufficient, and the Ministry of Food cannot immediately bear the burden. The Shanghai exchange may be opened to suppress the prices of daily necessities in the north. There is no problem in principle with restoring industrial loans, and they may be issued in the form of orders. However, the government cannot place orders for some small industries such as telegrams and glass, and other methods must be considered. The period of mortgage may be extended, and the collateral may be expanded to include factory buildings and machinery. As for the foreign exchange issue, which they discussed with Zhang for the longest time, since it involves the entire policy, no conclusion could be reached. It was only possible to increase the input of foreign exchange. The method of exporting foreign exchange and exporting grain in exchange for foreign exchange was difficult to obtain approval. In the afternoon at 4:00 PM, they went to visit Zhang Qun, the President of the Executive Yuan. Zhang agreed to help in principle, but there were no concrete results. The conversation also involved the issue of returning the Mentougou coal mine. In the morning of the 20th, they will visit the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Economic Affairs, and the Four Joint Offices. In the afternoon, they will study the surplus and shortage of grain in the north and south with the Ministry of Food to determine the allocation method. They may attend the regular meeting of the National Economic Council on the 22nd to report, but this will not affect the meeting of the heads of the relevant ministries and commissions that President Zhang had previously decided to convene. When the problem is largely resolved, they will visit the President again to complete all the work.</p>
<h3>Control Yuan Recommends That National Government Pay Attention to North China's Economy</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 19th] The Control Yuan held a discussion meeting of Control Committee members at 9:00 AM on the 19th, chaired by Wang Bijiang. Control Committee member Yu Shude proposed to make a representation based on the statements of the North China Delegation to the Capital. Because North China's military situation is urgent, the people of the country are all concerned, but the economic crisis is even more serious than the military, and it is often overlooked. Many of the Central Government's measures on North China's economy are inappropriate, further promoting the imbalance of North China's economy. The impact on the military is very serious and huge. A unanimous decision was made to ask the Control Yuan to send personnel to thoroughly investigate the departments in charge to find out what happened in order to review and handle it. It is also recommended that the National Government instruct the departments in charge of economic measures in North China to earnestly improve the measures by referring to the opinions submitted by the delegation.</p>
<h3>Issue of Opening Loans: To Be Submitted to the Plenary Session for Decision After Drafting Detailed Plans</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing dispatch, 19th] Authoritative sources reveal that Wu Yun Chu and others from Shanghai's industrial circles have requested the opening of loans. The Four Joint Offices are seeking the opinions of various banks for research. As of now, government decision-makers in charge of finance and economy still have two views on the opening of loans. One faction advocates opening, and the other faction opposes it. However, the previous suspension of loans was ordered by President Chiang Kai-shek, so whether to open it in the future depends on the detailed plans being drafted and submitted to President Chiang Kai-shek for a final decision.</p>
<h3>Yu Dawei Suspends Trip to United States</h3>
<p>[News from our newspaper] According to our city's English-language newspaper, the Greater Shanghai Evening Post, authoritative sources in Nanjing said that the Chinese government's efforts to obtain US aid months ago prioritized economy and finance. The US State Department has repeatedly hinted that it will not discuss the issue of military aid to China for the time being. Economic aid is already being discussed between 　　　Yiyuan and Runzhi. The trip to the United States by Minister of Transportation 　 Tianwei has been decided to be cancelled.</p>
<h3>National Army Launches Suppression War in Xiaozhan and Other Places South of Tianjin, Both Sides of Beining Railway; Communist Bandit Remnants Flee, National Army Engages</h3>
<p>[Our Tianjin dispatch, 19th] The National Army south of Tianjin launched a suppression operation in the Xiaozhan area at dawn on the 19th. By 2:00 PM, Xiaozhan, West Xiaozhan, Zhongtang, Chaozongqiao, and other places had been recovered one after another. The communist bandits' 20th and 21st Regiments had all fled south.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Peiping, 19th] The North China Bandit Suppression Headquarters announced that in order to ensure the safety of traffic on the Beining Railway, the National Army had dispatched powerful troops to launch a suppression operation on both sides of the railway. On the 16th, they found more than 2,000 main forces of the Communist Bandit's 11th Brigade in the areas of Shangxia Xinzhuang, Pangguanying, and Fanwangzhuang, 10 kilometers north of Liushouying, and dealt them a heavy blow. After a fierce battle for half a day, more than 300 communist bandits were killed, and the remnant bandits fled to the northwest. Another National Army unit encountered more than 600 communist bandits in Fangezhuang Qililun, about 5 kilometers north of Zhangjiazhuang (south of Changli), and launched a battle. More than 100 communist bandits were killed or wounded, and the remnant bandits retreated to the north. The National Army is still continuing the suppression operation. [Our Baoding dispatch, 19th] The communist bandits who had gathered in the Dawangdian area of Mancheng began to flee east this morning to harass the area. At 6:00 PM, more than 4,000 troops from the 18th Brigade of the Communist 6th Column had arrived in the areas of Zhonglianliang and Yangcun, 15 li northwest of Baoding. The mobile troops of the National Army stationed in Baoding went to engage them, and a fierce battle began at 7:00 PM. In addition, a unit of communist bandits also infiltrated the Qianhe area north of Baoding. This morning, a northbound car encountered the bandits on the south bank of the Caohe River and had a small contact. The car returned to Baoding.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Peiping, 19th] The powerful National Army troops that had penetrated deep into the border area of Hebei, Rehe, and Chahar not only completely defeated the seven regiments of Zhan's army but also thoroughly destroyed the communist bandits' old nest of Sihaiye, Ningdong, and Yongning in the northwest. They also transferred their forces to continue the suppression operation. Sihaiye was the old base area that the communist bandits had operated for 12 years. The communist bandits' military district headquarters and commissioner's office were located there. The destruction of the area was a great blow to the communist bandits. (News of the battle against the bandits in the Dabie Mountains is published in the left corner of page two.)</p>
<h3>Entire Bandit Suppression Work Can Be Completed in Three Years: Deng Wenyi Receives Reporters in Peiping</h3>
<p>[Our Peiping dispatch, 19th] Deng Wenyi received reporters on the 19th to review the gains and losses of the National Army's operations last year and to look forward to the future. Deng said: 80-90% of the 600,000 communist bandits within the pass can be eliminated within a year, and the entire bandit suppression work can be completed in three years. The development of the communist bandits' strength reached its peak last year and is now beginning to decline. The National Army must actively pursue and suppress them in the future and strengthen its political strength. The effects will be seen in three months. Fear and pessimism must be eliminated. The claim that the Northeast will be abandoned is absolutely untrue. Large army groups are being transferred to the north. Deng continued: In the 60 operations last year, 82 important battles were fought. Before October, an average of 3-5 battles were fought per month, and then it became more intense, with an average of 10-19 battles. The communist bandits' strength is currently about 1.1 million, 450,000 outside the pass, and 600,000 inside the pass. Last year, they lost nearly 800,000, but they have been replenished at any time. The loss of veteran cadres and soldiers is about 70%. Their shortcomings are the lack of veteran cadres and training, and their equipment is even worse. About one-quarter of the country's counties and cities are controlled by bandits, with a population of nearly 100 million, but 14 million have been forced to flee. The National Army's donations last year were about 400,000. Strategically, they were completely victorious.</p>
<h3>Chen Cheng Solemnly Declares That Jilin and Changchun Will Never Be Abandoned</h3>
<p>[Our Fanyang dispatch, 19th] Chen Cheng told reporters that rumors that the National Army would abandon Changchun and Jilin were purely rumors spread by villains. He solemnly declared that Changchun and Jilin would never be abandoned and that defenses would be strengthened.</p>
<h3>Northeast People in Beijing Urge Wei Lihuang to Take Office</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing dispatch, 19th] Wei Lihuang hosted a banquet for senior military officials in Beijing, including Qin Dechun, Lin Wei, Liu Fei, Fang Tian, Tang Enbo, Guan Jinyue, Guo Yi, and Xu Peigen, at 7:00 PM on the 19th, and exchanged views after the banquet. In addition, Wang Depu and others from the Northeast in Beijing visited Wei on the afternoon of the 19th to express their welcome and urge him to take office as soon as possible. [Our Changchun dispatch, 19th] Powerful National Army units have begun to suppress the communist bandit army in the northeast corner of Changchun.

<h3>Minister Bai Returns to Hankou from Xun; Three Provincial Chairmen of Henan, Hunan, and Hubei Travel Together</h3>
<p>[Our Hankou dispatch, 19th] Minister Bai returned to Hankou from Xun by plane at 3:00 PM on the 19th. Those who came with him were Chairman Liu Maoen of Henan, Chairman Wang Dongyuan of Hunan, and Chairman Wan Yaohuang of Hubei.</p>
<h3>Xuzhou-Shangqiu Section of Longhai Railway Scheduled to Open on the 25th</h3>

<h3>Remnant Bandits in Jiaodong Attempt to Stir Up Trouble; National Army Closely Monitoring</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Jinan, 19th] The communist bandits' 2nd, 7th, and 9th Columns, which had been routed from Jiaodong and fled to the edge of the Yimeng Mountains, suffered heavy casualties. Currently, their main forces, the 2nd and 9th Columns, are lurking in the southwest area of Anqiu County, and the 7th Column is hiding near the Shizilu area east of Juxian County. The troops in both places are actively reorganizing, forcibly conscripting young people, and collecting grain and labor, which is very busy. They may attempt to stir up trouble recently. The National Army is closely monitoring them. [Our Xuzhou dispatch, 19th] More than 10,000 wounded communist bandits from western Shandong were transported north from Anxingji (northeast of Dingtao). Yesterday, they sneaked across the Yellow River north of Sunkou (south of Shouzhang).</p>
<h3>Sichuan-Kang Border Divided into Suppression Zone; Bandit Suppression Headquarters Established</h3>

<h3>Total Budget for the First Half of This Year: Report of the Review by the Council of State Affairs Standing Committee; Suggestions for the Government to Implement Three Basic Reforms</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 19th] The Council of State Affairs Standing Committee has completed its review of the draft total budget for central government revenues and expenditures for the first half of the 37th year [of the Republic, i.e. 1948] on the 16th. It has passed the review report, which has been submitted to the Secretariat of the Council for finalization and will be sent directly to the government. The full text of the review report is as follows:</p>
<p>Having examined the central government's total budget and special budget for revenues and expenditures for the first half of the 37th year, the Committee has convened multiple special meetings of the Standing Committee for detailed review. It believes that given the national situation of depleted tax revenues, enormous expenditures, and the further amplification of these enormous expenditures due to soaring prices, it is impossible to create a realistic and accurate budget. This Committee deeply understands the current difficulties of the nation, and therefore does not intend to nitpick on any ordinary or special sections of the government's budget for the first half of the 37th year, nor does it intend to reduce its expenditure figures. This is entirely a matter of austerity, and is unrelated to averting the serious crisis of a potential total political and economic collapse in the future.</p>
<p>This Committee believes that sound national policies are based on a sound national budget. Upon reviewing the contents of this budget, it is evident that the proportion of active expenditures on production, construction, and the development of science and education is extremely small, while the proportion of passive expenditures on military expenses, general salaries, and administrative costs is extremely large. This shows that current policies are merely patching up deficiencies in an attempt to maintain the status quo, which will inevitably lead to a daily shrinking of production and a daily increase in expenditure. It is feared that the status quo may become unsustainable one day, which is truly alarming.</p>
<p>This Committee believes that the government must make a painful decision and implement the following basic reforms in order to avoid a potential total political and economic collapse in the future:</p>
<h3>Implement Streamlined Troops and Eliminate Military Malpractices</h3>
<p>Implement streamlined troops and eliminate military malpractices. The government has been compelled to quell the rebellion by force, resulting in enormous expenditures and a difficult-to-balance budget, which should be understood by the people. However, given that the National Army has superior weapons, several times the number of soldiers, and the assistance of a heroic air force, why is it unable to quickly defeat the rebel army? This may be due to excessive military malpractices. The biggest military malpractice now is "eating empty pay." According to the budget, the number of officers and soldiers is five million. The strength appears to be far away from the objective. If there are not many vacant positions, why is it so? As a result, it not only wastes national funds but also corrupts military discipline and discourages the fighting spirit of officers and soldiers. If the commanders in the military are very wealthy and seek illegal profits, then those below will follow suit. This army will inevitably become corrupt and unable to fight. Secondly, the military organizations, from the Ministry of National Defense downwards, are so large that the number of non-combatants, such as adjutants, messengers, and guards, is high. Even after the establishment of the Ministry of National Defense and several reforms, the waste of manpower and financial resources has not been eliminated, which is regrettable. Today, the government must implement the doctrine of elite troops and thoroughly eliminate all malpractices in the military so that the suppression of the rebellion can be successful as soon as possible and the budget can be easily balanced.</p>
<h3>Reform the Currency System Promptly to Stop Soaring Prices</h3>
<p>Reform the currency system promptly to stop soaring prices. The huge budget is closely related to rising prices. If prices continue to soar in the future, then the budget, which is now considered huge, will be even more so. Therefore, stopping the rise in prices is a necessary condition for stabilizing the budget. Efforts should be made in many aspects to stop the rise in prices, but reducing currency circulation and stabilizing currency value are particularly urgent. It is not easy to reduce currency circulation today, so the only option is to reform the monetary system to stabilize the currency value. Therefore, this Committee hopes that the government will immediately take effective preparations and steps to quickly realize this goal in order to solve the current dangerous cycle of currency inflation and price increases stimulating each other, so that people's livelihood can be slightly stabilized.</p>
<h3>Thoroughly Reform Internal Affairs to Expand the Financial Base</h3>
<p>Thoroughly reform internal affairs to expand the financial base. Since the budget is so huge and the deficit accounts for 39% of the total budget, it cannot be filled solely by saving money and eliminating private gains and waste. It must rely on borrowing domestic and foreign debts. The draft special budget already lists debt as a revenue item, indicating that it will use loans to make up for the deficit. The people of our country are patriotic, and friendly countries in the world are willing to assist China's recovery with economic power, but many are hesitant due to our low administrative efficiency and corrupt bureaucracy. This Committee believes that our country is in a serious situation. If we want to gain the trust of the people in government-issued bonds and the early success of loans from friendly countries, we must thoroughly reform internal affairs. We sincerely hope that the government will take the opinions of those at home and abroad who oppose and criticize the government as a warning, sincerely accept them, sincerely implement democracy, and sincerely eliminate all malpractices in politics. Then the people will actively purchase bonds, and loans from friendly countries will come without being asked.</p>
<h3>The Government Should Pay Attention to Science, Culture, and Economy</h3>
<p>In addition, there is one more thing that must be brought to the attention of the government. This year has already begun to implement the Constitution, and Article 164 of the Constitution stipulates that "the expenditure on education, science, and culture shall not be less than 15% of the total amount of its budget at the central level..." The ordinary part of this budget alone is less than this number. If the special part is included, the difference will be even greater.</p>
<p>Finally, this Committee has repeatedly stated in recent years that in the current situation of increasing inequality in wealth, it advocates equal burden-sharing and levying special donations on the super-rich. Now that the budget's revenue has reached the point of exhaustion, the government should make a decision to implement an excessive profit tax. We believe that political power should be used to requisition the property of wealthy Chinese citizens and their funds deposited abroad, which should be used to fill the deficit and overcome the unprecedented difficulties.</p>
<h3>Kuomintang Central Committee Memorial Week: Xu Kan Reports on Budget Situation</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 19th] Xu Kan, Director of the National Government's Directorate General of Budgets, Accounts and Statistics, reported at the Kuomintang Central Committee Memorial Week meeting on the morning of the 19th that the total budget for the first half of this year is over 9.6 trillion, but various tax revenues have also increased. The total tax revenue and income from handling materials reached over 5.8 trillion, accounting for 61% of the total revenue. The difference between income and expenditure is 39%. The government is planning to raise special donations and seek assistance from abroad to remedy the situation so that it will not rely on issuing funds for expenditure as in the past. He also stated that the largest expenditure this year is on living allowances for civil servants, which is a special phenomenon under the condition of high prices. As long as the suppression of the rebellion is completed, the expenditure on special departments can be reduced. Xu also pointed out that only by stabilizing the currency value and stabilizing prices can the current political and economic crisis be reversed.</p>

<h3>From American Aid Flour to Mastering Materials</h3>
<p>Yesterday afternoon, the acceptance ceremony for the first batch of American aid relief supplies was held at the First Wharf Reception Center of the China Merchants Bureau in this city. This was a very meaningful event. What China accepted yesterday was 8,000 tons of relief flour. Although this is only a small part of American aid materials, in this time of food panic, the Chinese government, with the continuous assistance from the United States, can begin to implement the universal distribution of civilian food in the five major cities of Nanjing, Shanghai, Tianjin, Beiping, and Guangzhou, in order to achieve the goal of stabilizing food prices, and then use the proceeds from the distribution of materials to purchase other relief supplies, which will be widely distributed to the people in urgent need of relief throughout the country. This has opened a new page in the history of Sino-American relations. Such timely and effective assistance from the United States to China can be truly said to be a friend in need. The Chinese people, especially the citizens of Shanghai who first accepted this batch of flour, must all express their heartfelt gratitude.</p>
<p>In this regard, we can prove that the banners with unsightly slogans written on them by students who marched in this city on the 17th to protest the Kowloon incident must have been the work of some people with ulterior motives and not the public opinion of the general good citizens. In everything in the world, we should think calmly and quietly. The behavior of "returning evil for good" will be despised by the people of a great country.</p>
<p>Today, this newspaper does not want to talk much about how we should thank our American allies for their kindness, but would like to talk about how we should master materials and how to use those mastered materials to reduce or eliminate economic difficulties in the future, starting from the arrival of American aid materials.</p>
<p>The discussion of mastering materials did not begin today. Since the War of Resistance, due to the urgent needs of the military, the obstruction of overseas sources, the destruction of production enterprises in various places, and the obstruction of land and water transportation, the concept of valuing materials over currency has inadvertently deepened in people's hearts. People have stored up in various ways to prepare for emergencies, so as to reside in, and to protect currency values. The country has also spared no effort to purchase and collect goods in order to accumulate reserves and facilitate use. It has been more than two years since the restoration, but currency and other issues have not been resolved smoothly, so the theory of mastering materials and grasping materials is still a consistent policy of the authorities today.</p>
<p>In terms of the measures taken by the government, the ways to grasp materials can be roughly divided into eight categories: (1) accepting enemy and puppet materials; (2) exporting state-owned production enterprises; (3) accepting loans or donations from friendly countries; (4) dividing enemy reparations; (5) importing goods ordered from abroad; (6) ordering goods obtained through loan methods; (7) purchasing agricultural products by various methods; and (8) products obtained by private enterprises under the control mode. There are fewer problems with items 1 to 5. Item 6 is one of the methods set by the economic reform plan, but it has been half a year and the implementation draft has just been drafted. Under item 7, purchases can be divided into free competitive purchases (such as cotton before the establishment of the Control Committee), national monopolies (such as coal in designated areas by the Fuel Management Committee), and official price purchases (such as rice and grain purchased by various provinces). These have caused a lot of controversy and resistance. Private enterprise products are purchased and sold by the state. The most obvious example is the comprehensive management recently implemented in the textile industry. Whether it can be successfully launched remains to be proven by facts.</p>
<p>The general opinion is that the state should master materials, regardless of its motives, but it must adhere to the following creeds: First, it must take into account the appropriate profits of producers and must not suppress and buy them too cheaply, which will destroy their re-production. Second, it must maintain the survival and development of the original business. Do not kill the chicken to get the eggs, just to seek temporary pleasure. Third, state-owned and private enterprises should advance in parallel on the principle of equal opportunities and fair competition, and should not show favoritism, which will destroy the fragile foundation of national industry. Fourth, the state's control of materials has its great mission and should not be short-sighted and take the opportunity to seek profit. In particular, it cannot allow the officials in charge to manipulate them, which will incur criticism of monopolizing and engaging in private fraud.</p>
<p>The most legitimate uses of the state's control of materials are no more than the following five items: (1) For allocation. The intention is to stabilize prices and enrich people's use. Therefore, regardless of whether the recipients of the allocation are direct consumers or processing manufacturers, once prices are raised and profits are sought, other uses are made, the original intention is completely lost. (2) To promote exports. This was originally a last resort when overseas sales channels were bad. The intention is to promote exports and earn foreign exchange, which is different from purely operating businesses. In order to maintain the interests of domestic producers and to expand overseas markets, the state should have a long-term and permanent vision when collecting these materials, and should not be short-sighted about the current gains and losses, and should do it even if it loses money for a while. (3) For military supply. During war, military use comes first, which is a completely consumptive nature and does not generate profit. (4) To regulate surpluses and deficiencies, that is, to supply the surplus materials from place A to place B where materials are lacking, or to transfer the cheaper goods from place C to place D where prices are higher, so as to achieve the goal of suppressing prices and stabilizing people's livelihood. This should be the greatest function of the state's control of materials. It is also possible to buy cheap and sell expensive in handling this matter, thereby obtaining considerable profits, but since the purpose is to suppress prices and stabilize people's livelihood, even if money is occasionally made, it is only an unexpected byproduct and should not be regarded as a matter of course. (5) To reduce speculation. That is to say, the government controls a large amount of materials, so that ordinary "profiteers" have no goods to hoard, that is, there is no opportunity to speculate, and there is nothing strange to live in, which also seems to make sense. However, if the price of goods controlled by the government rises at any time and follows the black market without the government selling them in batches at a fixed official price, quantity, and time, it is as if the government itself has become a big hoarder, and the original function is lost.</p>
<p>Judging from the above points, we can know that the government's grasp of materials should not take revenue as the sole purpose. Moreover, judging from the language and words publicly announced by the authorities in the past, there has never been a time when the purpose of revenue has been clearly mixed in. Therefore, the public officials who handle this matter should all ask about this meaning, clarify the goal, and avoid all side effects, so as to seek clear promotion and not change or degenerate halfway.</p>
<p>Recently, the government plans to expand distribution to stabilize people's livelihood, and on the one hand, to exchange materials to adjust international trade. These are all legitimate ways to master materials. The exchange of cotton yarn for Indian cotton, the purchase of foreign wheat to supply flour mills for flour production, or the purchase of rapeseed and soybeans to fill the raw materials for oil production, these measures are not without a small supplement to the national economy and people's livelihood. Moreover, this American aid food donation and transportation can promote universal distribution, and the implementation can be commended. It is a pity that there were quite a few short-sighted people in the past who specialized in small calculations and arbitrarily suppressed and blackmailed in the name of fair prices when handling purchases, resulting in unexpected losses to farmers. However, when distributing, they repeatedly raised prices in the name of adjustment, not hesitating to publicly compete with the black market. The huge profits obtained were often discounted and arbitrarily spent, forming a division of fat among a few people, and the funds could not be used for public benefit. There were even cases where the public sector purchased and collected goods in name, while private individuals hoarded them in disguise. They used their strong strength, large institutions, and superior craftsmanship to compete with ordinary merchants and civilians for short-term gains. This is when the country is about to implement a material control policy, and it is necessary to pay close attention and correct it.</p>

<h3>Zhu Shieming Arrives in Shanghai, Going to Nanjing Tonight to Report for Duty</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] General Zhu Shieming, Deputy Representative of our country to the United Nations Security Council, arrived in this city at the airport by Northwest Airlines flight at 9 pm last night because he was summoned to report for duty. Those who went to the airport included Xu Zhennan, a specialist from the delegation to China, and others. Zhu's settings have not been resolved today due to the stalemate caused by different opinions between the United States and the Soviet Union in the past. The atmosphere for military aid to China is very enthusiastic. If the military is aided, there is no problem in terms of technology and transportation to give the remaining military supplies in the Pacific to our country. However, the economic and military assistance are all part of a major problem. If the former is resolved, the former is only a technical problem. Today, the United States remembers to determine the principles of assistance to China, but it has not yet decided. Zhu is scheduled to report for duty in Beijing today, saying that he does not.</p>
<h3>On the Matter of Missionary Evacuation, Foreign Reporters Ask Questions; Chairman Replies in Writing</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 19th] United Press news: On the 19th, a United Press reporter asked Chairman Chiang in writing about the fact that some missionaries in some areas were not allowed to evacuate due to the fear of the Communist bandits' intrusion, "Who produced this matter?" Chairman Chiang replied in writing: The missionaries of various Christian denominations in Hebei, Henan, Shanxi, and Shandong in North China have been forced to transfer and leave their missionary posts due to the rebellion of the Communist bandits. I am very concerned about their hard work. Our local authorities must be able to carefully protect them and provide them with assistance wherever needed, so that they can quickly escape the poisonous hands of the Communist bandits and reach a safe place as soon as possible. The Communist bandits' inhuman, cruel, and brutal acts are a great stain on the history of human civilization. Wherever the bandits go, they not only destroy the body but also destroy the soul at the same time. The Christian leaders often suffer the most from their harm. Only when our country unites as one and concentrates its efforts to quell the bandits' rebellion and eliminate these human moths as soon as possible can all compatriots in the country be at peace in both material and soul, and the displaced missionaries can return to their homeland and spread the gospel of Christ.</p>

<h3>Peng Xuepei Returns to Shanghai, Talking About His Impressions of Inspecting Five Provinces</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] Peng Xuepei, a member of the Political Committee, returned to Shanghai on the 18th after being ordered to inspect the five provinces of Zhejiang, Jiangxi, Hunan, Guangdong, and Guangxi. Yesterday, he met with reporters and said that Jiangxi Province has fertile land and abundant mineral resources, and if it is actively developed, it can become the "Northeast of the South." Guilin is beautiful and picturesque, and if it is properly organized to attract Chinese and foreign tourists, it can become the "Switzerland of the East." Guangdong, Guangxi, Hunan, and Jiangxi provinces can form an economic unit by themselves, with Guangzhou as the export port. The Yuehan, Xiang-Gui, and Zhe-Gan railways are well managed, and efforts should be made to increase their vehicles and railway equipment. In order to connect Guangdong and Jiangxi provinces, the Yue-Gan Railway should be built as soon as possible. The route should be from Qingjiang in Jiangxi to Qujiang in northern Guangdong.</p>
<h3>Tianhe Coal Mine in Ji'an Taken Over by Jiangxi Provincial Government</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanchang, 19th] The Tianhe Coal Mine in Ji'an was mined by local people who raised funds in the early years of the Republic of China. However, due to insufficient funds and poor management, the Jiangxi Provincial Government decided to formally take over the mine in order to make the production, transportation, and sales of Tianhe coal reasonable in view of the current shortage of fuel in Nanjing and Shanghai. It also formed the Tianhe Coal Mine Guidance Committee. In the future, it will increase the number of night shifts for land and water transportation and sales, so that the daily output can be increased from 60 tons to 200 tons. Water transportation will first improve the river channel, and it is currently surveying the waterway from Tianhe to Ji'an. At the same time, it is also planning to explore new lines.</p>
<h3>Jiangxi River Water Conservancy Project Fully Surveyed</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanchang, 19th] The Jiangxi River Water Conservancy Project Survey and Design Committee has been established to preside over the work.

<h3>Fujian Provincial Council Requests Continued Handling of Fishery Relief</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Fuzhou, 19th] Fujian Province is an important fishing area, and more than one million people directly or indirectly depend on aquatic products for their livelihoods. During the war, the coast was severely destroyed by the enemy and puppets, and fishermen suffered heavy losses, and the fishing village economy went bankrupt and needed urgent relief. In the past, the Executive Yuan's fishery relief plan for Fujian Province planned to repair fishing boats and distribute motorized boats, but it has not been implemented. After the Executive Yuan ended, it set up a fishery material management branch to handle it for half a year, but it also failed to achieve any results. It was also recently abolished. The Fujian Provincial Council believes that the distribution of fishery materials will be difficult for Fujian Province to obtain preferential treatment in the future, which is a huge loss to the fishery. Therefore, at this congress, it passed a proposal to "strive to continue to handle the fishery rehabilitation business in Fujian Province in order to relieve fishermen and develop the fishery." The congress telegraphed the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry and the Fishery Management Office, requesting: (1) to continue to set up institutions in Fujian to promote fishery rehabilitation business; (2) to quickly distribute materials, repair fishing boats, and relieve fishermen; (3) to quickly allocate motorized fishing boats and processing equipment for training fishery personnel and improving fishery technology.</p>

<h3>Zibo Coal Mine Crisis: Coal Cannot Be Exported, Transportation Costs Are High, Urgently Awaiting Remedy</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper, Jinan, 19th] According to Yu Wuheng, director of the Zibo Mining Area of the Resources Committee: The Zibo Mining Area is facing an unprecedented crisis. Since the opening of the Xuji section of the Tianjin-Pukou Railway, the coal from Zaozhuang and other places in southern Shandong has been transported to Jinan by train at a low transportation cost, selling for only 2.6 million per ton. Although the Zibo coal sells for only more than 400,000 per ton at the mine, the transportation cost of transporting it to Jinan by car or horse is 2.6 million yuan. Therefore, the coal stored in Zibo is piled up like mountains and cannot be exported. Before the opening of the Jinan-Zhangdian section of the Jiaoji Railway, the government is urgently hoping for effective relief, otherwise tens of thousands of employees will lose their jobs.</p>
<h3>Salaries for Provincial Civil Servants in Jiangsu Province Will Be Paid According to Index from Next Month; County-Level Salaries Will Be Reduced Due to Financial Difficulties</h3>

<h3>Executive Yuan Formulates Payment Methods for Private Enterprises Purchasing Japanese Reparations Materials at Reduced Prices</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Report] The Executive Yuan has formulated payment methods and a five-part payment notice form for private enterprises purchasing Japanese reparations materials at reduced prices. The Ministry of Finance has sent a letter to the National Treasury Bureau of the Central Bank, and the National Treasury Bureau has sent a letter to the branches of the Central Bank for investigation, because Articles 3 and 4 of the methods are related to the National Treasury.

<h3>Main Force of Bandits in Dabie Mountains Eliminated; National Army Begins Mopping-Up Operations</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Nanjing, 19th Dispatch] After the remnants of Liu Bandit's First Column in the Dabie Mountains were defeated by the National Army in Xincai, the main force fled north to Huazhuang, Longkouji, Yangbu and other places, attempting to contact the main force of the Chen Bandit's First, Third, Fourth, Sixth, and Eighth Columns who had committed crimes in Huaiyang from Tongxu and Fugou, and to receive personnel and ammunition supplies. After being severely damaged by the National Army in the area north of Lishan, they have fled east in several groups. Their main force has now arrived at Shuangliushu, Baiqueyuan, Yanjiahe, Doushanhe and other places north of Jingfu.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Wuhu, 19th Dispatch] Two hundred soldiers from Baizhou along the river in Wuwu County, who had fled from Tongpingshan, planned to steal across the Yangtze River to the south and flee the remnants of the army in Fanchang. They fled north from the Jiang'an River.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency Hankou, 19th Dispatch] The Second and Sixth Columns of the Communist bandits who had infiltrated between Lixuan and Huashandian intended to peek at the southern section of Pinghan and flee west in the past week. After the National Army launched a fierce attack from three sides, the Eighteenth Brigade and Eight Brigade Headquarters and one regiment of the Sixth Column were completely wiped out in Wangjiadian, north of Lishan. Only 300 or so of another regiment fled east. In this battle, the main force that Bandit Bo Cheng's troops could gather was captured by the National Army and eliminated. The reporter once met a senior person in charge who claimed that since Bandit Liu Bo Cheng's troops fled south to the Dabie Mountains last year, the National Army has carried out a planned encirclement and suppression, and has tied up and routed its rampant main force. The remaining bandits are scattered and active in the mountainous areas. At present, each group of bandits no longer has a concentration of more than a brigade, or has the name of a brigade, but its strength is mostly damaged and insufficient. As for the county towns occupied by the bandits, except for Yingshan and Jingfu, which are waiting to be recovered, they have been recovered by the National Army, and the remnants of the bandits in the four suburbs outside the city have been wiped out. Therefore, the work of suppressing bandits in the Dabie Mountains is currently entering the mopping-up stage, and administrative organizations will soon be rebuilt to carry out the pacification and consolation work after the recovery. According to the total statistics of this encirclement and suppression, from the end of November last year to the present, the various columns of Bandit Liu have been repeatedly attacked, and most of them have been defeated and unable to form an army. The First Column and the Chen Yi and Chen Geng troops, a total of five columns, attacked Queshan for five days and five nights, and were fiercely attacked by the National Army, resulting in 10,000 casualties and a retreat. In addition, the First Column of Bandit Liu was defeated at Wulongdian, south of Xincai, on the night of the 11th. The 59th Regiment of the First Brigade, which was an elite force among the bandits, was known as the "Hero Regiment". One of the strongest battalions was completely wiped out that night. The Seventh Brigade of the Third Column was defeated in the northeast of Huoshan, and the regimental commander was killed. The Ninth Brigade was encircled and suppressed by the National Army in Zijinhe, north of Taihu Lake, and was largely disintegrated. The 17th Brigade of the Sixth Column was repeatedly attacked by the National Army in Baiqueyuan and Xiongjiaxing, east of Macheng, and all fled east of Huangpi Station. In the Battle of Liulin, the Tenth and Twelfth Columns of the Chen bandits were wiped out by the National Army, resulting in 8,000 casualties. The number of prisoners of war reached more than 2,000. At present, the combat effectiveness of the 18th Brigade and the 7th Brigade of the 10th Column of Bandit Liu has been completely lost. Other bandit units can only carry out mobile harassment, hoping to cover up their administrative cadres and local native communists who are scattered in many places. According to statistics, since the encirclement and suppression of the Dabie Mountains began on November 27 last year, the results of 50 days of battle are as follows: a total of 9,528 bandits were killed, and 1,908 rifles, 91 light machine guns, 3 heavy machine guns, 31 pistols, 4 small artillery pieces, 15 mortars, 35 grenade launchers, 2 telephones, 206 horses, and 1 car were seized. At present, Bandit Liu still has the numbers of the Second, Third, and Sixth Columns in the Dabie Mountains, as well as soldiers from the Second and Third detachments, etc., who are using the vast mountainous area to wage guerrilla warfare. It will take some time to eliminate them. The responsible authorities have decided to implement a plan to fundamentally eliminate the bandits by excluding the military from politics, organizing and training the people, and establishing local self-defense forces. Bandit Liu's skills are exhausted, and his dream of establishing a base in the Dabie Mountains has been completely shattered.</p>

<h3>British Parliament Reopens Today; Bevin's Foreign Policy to Change Course</h3>
<p>[United Press London, 18th Dispatch] Parliament, which adjourned for a month for the Christmas holidays, is scheduled to reopen on Tuesday. A two-day debate on foreign affairs will begin on Thursday, at which time Foreign Secretary Bevin will present the government's foreign policy. Since the breakdown of the London Four-Power Foreign Ministers' Conference, British foreign policy has been re-established after several cabinet meetings. In addition, Parliament will discuss the bill to nationalize the gas industry. The most important bill of this session may be the budget bill to be submitted by Chancellor of the Exchequer Cripps in April. After Parliament resumes, there will inevitably be a dispute over the annual salary of Princess Elizabeth and her husband.</p>
<p>[United Press London, 18th Dispatch] When Foreign Secretary Bevin presents British foreign policy to Parliament on Thursday, he will state that the Labor government's strategy for dealing with communism is no longer merely defensive, but should promote strong cooperation between Western Europe and the United States. As for the Soviet Union, it is only willing to seek understanding on an equal footing of fifty-fifty. This is the only hope for preserving the freedom-loving nations and democratic ideals of all countries. What Bevin has in mind for cooperation between Western Europe and the United States is generally economic in nature, and not a military alliance, at least in the initial stage, so as to lay a certain foundation for completing the Marshall Plan for European recovery. Bevin's speech may be Britain's formal abandonment of the middle-of-the-road policy, and it will no longer try to reconcile the United States and the Soviet Union. The United States originally hoped to become a bridge between the East and West during the transitional period from the end of the war to the signing of the peace treaty, but now it has to change course. There have been signs of this new strategy recently, as Prime Minister Attlee and Deputy Prime Minister Morrison have successively delivered speeches, which are the beginnings of it.</p>
<h3>Britain Concerned About Ruhr Situation; Appeals to US for Food Relief to Prevent Turmoil</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Report] New York 19th Broadcast: Washington News, British Foreign Secretary Bevin made an urgent appeal to the US, requesting that food be quickly transported to Germany in order to prevent the increasingly serious unrest in that area. Secretary of State Marshall and the military department decided to give it priority consideration. [Reuters Washington 18th Dispatch] Authoritative sources say: British officials have informed the US State Department of the British government's greatest concern about the current situation in Germany, and have asked the US to cooperate with Britain in every possible way to deal with it. British officials pointed out that the best solution is to have a steady stream of American grains and other food into the Anglo-American merged area, and have requested the State Department to study the possibility of this matter.</p>
<p>British Ambassador Inver Chapel will visit Secretary of State Marshall this week to discuss this matter. It is reported that British Foreign Secretary Bevin is extremely worried about the current situation in Germany, believing that it may cause serious repercussions throughout Western Europe and hinder the implementation of the Marshall Plan. When British officials informed the State Department of Bevin's intentions, they emphasized that although Britain is responsible for the public security of the Ruhr area, the US has to take responsibility for importing food to help the area. It is expected that US officials will review this week the possibility of transferring food originally intended to be transported to other places to the Ruhr to reduce the cause of the Ruhr turmoil. [Reuters Berlin 18th Dispatch] People close to the Soviet military government said that the Commander-in-Chief of the Soviet Army in Germany, Sokolovsky, returned to Moscow a week ago to discuss the new economic and administrative measures for the Anglo-American merged area with senior Soviet authorities. He was originally scheduled to return to Berlin on the 17th, but did not return because the weather was bad and he could not travel. It is detained because the discussion has not yet ended, and it has not yet been ascertained. But it is expected to return to Berlin before the Berlin Music Management Committee meets on Monday. At the same time, it is reported that the German People's Congress, which is scheduled to meet on March 18, will hold a vote on the issue of holding a plebiscite throughout the country to decide on political and economic unification. If the Soviet Union withdraws from the Allied Control Council and establishes an East German state, this plebiscite throughout Germany will not be held. Therefore, it is expected that after the Soviet Union raises serious protests against the new economic and administrative measures for the Anglo-American merged area, it will sit and observe its repercussions, and will not immediately withdraw from the Allied Control Council.</p>
<h3>Ruhr Coal Production Decreases</h3>
<p>[Associated Press Berlin, 19th Dispatch] General Clay, commander of the American occupation zone in Germany, reported to Washington on the 19th that coal production in the Ruhr area has been seriously affected due to a lack of timber and other materials. Coal production, on which the Western European economy depends, has fallen to 23,600 tons since January 2, which is 17% lower than the post-war record reached on November 29 last year. Coal production in December was 6% lower than in November. The report covers two weeks, ending January 12, before the recent strike.</p>

<h3>British and French Finance Ministers Agree; French Franc to Be Devalued; But Does Not Affect the Current Value of the British Pound</h3>
<p>[Associated Press London, 18th Dispatch] Well-informed sources said on the 18th that Britain and France agreed on the 18th to devalue the French franc without affecting the current value of the British pound. This plan was completed after a meeting between British Chancellor of the Exchequer Cripps and French Finance Minister Meyer. It is rumored that they intend to devalue the French franc from 119 to one US dollar to 250 to one US dollar. On the other hand, the purpose of this financial strategy is to promote the purchase of food and renovation of industrial machinery by the two countries, which is of great benefit to the European recovery plan.</p>
<p>[Reuters Paris, 18th Dispatch] French Finance Minister Meyer returned to Paris today from London after meeting with British Chancellor of the Exchequer Cripps. Meyer refused to make any comments after getting off the plane.</p>
<h3>Management of European Aid Funds; Should Not Belong to the State Department; Taft Calls for Selection of Competent Personnel</h3>
<p>[Associated Press Washington, 18th Dispatch] US Senator Taft said on the 18th that he demanded that a competent person be responsible for presiding over the Marshall Plan, and this person should hold a position within the President's cabinet. Taft told listeners on the broadcast that the money bag management of the large aid plan should not be in the hands of the State Department.</p>
<h3>European Strategic Raw Materials Should be Supplied to the United States - Demand Raised by the U.S. House Foreign Affairs Committee</h3>
<p>(United Press International, Washington, 18th) The House Foreign Affairs Committee today demanded guarantees that the United States obtain vital strategic raw materials as compensation for aiding European reconstruction. Democratic Congressman Richards insisted that this point be explicitly stipulated in the bill authorizing the Marshall Plan for European aid, or in any ultimately adopted measures, and this proposal was supported by a number of members from both the Democratic and Republican parties. The House Foreign Affairs Committee will conduct a deeper study of this issue within the week and question Ambassador to England, Douglas.</p>
<h3>Canadian Prime Minister to Retire</h3>
<p>(Reuters, Ottawa, 19th) Political sources say that Canadian Prime Minister King, aged 79, who has been in office for 19 years, will announce his retirement tomorrow when addressing the Advisory Committee of the Liberal Federation of Canada. Current Foreign Minister Laurent is expected to succeed him as Prime Minister.</p>
<h3>Soviet Delegation to Arrive in London This Week - To Continue Business Negotiations - Discussion of Details for Purchasing British Industrial Equipment</h3>
<p>(United Press International, London, 19th) A 19-member Soviet delegation is expected to arrive in London this week to begin discussions on purchasing industrial equipment under the Anglo-Soviet trade agreement signed in Moscow last month. The equipment will include railway tracks, locomotives, trucks, sawmill equipment, and scientific instruments, and the shipment of these materials is scheduled to be completed within one to three years. The Soviet delegation will be led by Mr. Gusev, Director of the Soviet Machinery Import Department. British officials believe that the arrival of the Soviet delegation indicates that the Soviet Union does not want to mix politics and commerce, and is therefore willing to conduct commercial negotiations even when political relations with Western Europe are very disharmonious. Previously, British Foreign Secretary Bevin and Trade Secretary Wilson had also expressed their strong desire to develop trade relations with the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe. Under the new Anglo-Soviet trade agreement, Britain can import 750,000 tons of coarse grains from the Soviet Union before September of this year, while the latter will obtain from Britain 25,000 to 35,000 tons of light railway tracks, 1,100 narrow-gauge locomotive front-ends, 2,400 freight cars, 210 excavators, 200 broad-gauge locomotives, 150 fifty-kilowatt generators, scientific instruments worth £1.5 million, and sawmill machinery worth £1 million. The above-mentioned mechanical equipment will be contracted by various private British factories, and the British government will give them priority in obtaining raw materials so that they can be completed and delivered as soon as possible, with the delivery scheduled to be completed within three years. Detailed deadlines have been set in Moscow by experts from both Britain and the Soviet Union. Britain will assist the Soviet Union in purchasing wool, rubber, aluminum, cocoa beans, etc. The first Soviet shipment of grains for feeding livestock is expected to arrive here next month.</p>
<h3>U.S. Congress Favors Reducing First Year's Aid to Europe - Taft Believes it Should Not Exceed $3 Billion</h3>
<p>(Reuters, Washington, 19th) The Senate Foreign Relations Committee, resuming its review of the Marshall Plan today, expressed even more severe criticism of the plan, aiming to reduce appropriations for the first year of its implementation. This trend has become increasingly evident in Congress. Government officials have completed their statements on the plan, and starting this week, those who will make statements will be figures who criticize the plan.</p>
<p>Among those who appeared today to make statements was the well-known economist and presidential advisor Baruch, who will present his views on both the amount of aid and the method of management. Senators who had previously met with him said that Baruch did not fervently support the Marshall Plan. Those who will appear before the Foreign Relations Committee on Monday include Republican foreign policy advisor Dulles, etc. While Truman has requested $6.8 billion for European aid in the initial fifteen months, some members of Congress are advocating reducing the first year's aid to Europe to $4 billion. Republican Senator Taft argues for an even greater reduction. He pointed out that the European recovery plan expenses in Truman's proposed budget for the next fiscal year are actually only $4 billion, so he believes that the president is already anticipating a reduction in the amount of aid. Taft also said: Recently, there has been a proposal that the aid to Europe paid by the U.S. Treasury in the first year should not exceed $4 billion, but the government is allowed to order other supplies beyond this amount. In other words, the government will still need to ask Congress for approval of appropriations when paying for these other supplies, thus giving Congress another opportunity to discuss the implementation of the European aid plan. Taft further stated that he personally believes that the aid to Europe paid by the U.S. Treasury in the first year should not exceed $3 billion. Moreover, Senator Bridges, Chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee, recently stated that his committee will also study the possibility of reducing the cash allocated for European aid in the first year. He emphasized, "In any case, the Senate Appropriations Committee will conduct a thorough review of the European aid plan before passing the appropriations."</p>

<p>(Reuters, Ankara, 19th) Yugoslav Ambassador to Turkey Simic has been summoned by Yugoslav Prime Minister Tito and has returned to Belgrade to attend a conference of Yugoslav ambassadors abroad to discuss the possible international repercussions of Yugoslavia's recognition of the provisional Greek government of Greek guerrilla commander Marcos.

When asked if he meant war, he replied in the affirmative, adding that the responsibility would not lie with Yugoslavia.

<h3>U.S. New Budget - Republicans to Reduce It - To Force Tax Cut Bill Through Congress</h3>
<p>(United Press International, Washington, 18th) Leading figures of the Republican Party in both the House and Senate will meet on the 19th to prepare to launch the first attack on President Truman's proposed budget, opening the way for the passage of their tax cut bill. The meeting was convened to determine the maximum amount that Congress can allocate for government expenses in the 1949 fiscal year, but at the same time to discuss strategies to enable the tax cut proposal to be forced through Congress even if Truman exercises his veto power. Truman's budget proposes government expenses of $39.7 billion. House Speaker Martin, who will chair the meeting, declined to say how much of the president's expense figures could be reduced. Other Republican leaders are demanding a reduction of $3 billion to $5 billion.</p>
<h3>U.S. Perception of Japan Improves - Rumor that it May Receive a U.S. Loan of $700 Million</h3>
<p>(Central News Agency, Tokyo, 19th) According to Jiji Press, Japanese Finance Minister Kurusu Takeo stated in a speech at the Fukushima branch of the Democratic Party that Japan may receive a $700 million loan from the United States this year. Recently, the U.S. perception of Japan seems to have improved, and the United States recognizes Japan's various efforts to seek "economic independence," which is why it is willing to invest.</p>
<h3>Strengthening Naval Power in the Mediterranean - U.S. Actively Aiding Turkey and Greece</h3>
<p>(United Press International, Washington, 19th) Military officials said on the 19th that the $100 million in the U.S. aid bill to Turkey will be put into operation at high speed next month. Congress voted to approve aid to Turkey, which is part of Truman's plan to contain communism in Turkey and Greece in the Mediterranean. After Congress passes this joint plan, Greece will be the first country to be considered. Aid to Turkey began months ago, including improving port shipyards and a $5 million highway construction fee, which is enough to allow military supplies to flow in steadily.</p>

<h3>Receiving the First Batch of American Relief Flour - Welcome Ceremony at the China Merchants Wharf - Leaders Attending Create a Grand Occasion - The Friendship in Adversity Will Be Forever Remembered by the Chinese People</h3>
<p>(Report from this newspaper) The first American aid to China relief shipment, the "California," carrying 8,482 long tons of flour, totaling 190,000 bags, arrived at Wharf No. 1 of the China Merchants Bureau at 11 a.m. the day before yesterday. Miao Jiaming, Chairman of the Executive Yuan's Committee for Handling American Relief Materials, considered this aid to China shipment to be of great significance. To express gratitude, he held a welcome ceremony at the wharf at 3 p.m. yesterday, inviting U.S. Consul General Cabot, Moody, the Acting Director of the American United China Relief, and various American representatives from the relevant relief organizations to participate. The ceremony was co-hosted by Wu, the Chairman of the Shanghai Distribution Committee for American Relief Materials, and Mayor Wu. Other attendees included City Council Speaker Pan, Vice Minister of Food Guan Jiyu, Vice Minister of Social Affairs Huang Bodu, Deputy Secretary-General of the National Economic Commission Gu Yuxun, Dr. Yen Hui-ching, U.S. Deputy Consul General Billig, Director of the Social Affairs Bureau Wu Kaixian, Director of the Shanghai Office of the Committee for Handling Relief Materials Chen Guangyuan, and Director of the U.S. Information Service Connors, totaling about 60 people.</p>
<p>First, Chairman Miao, Mayor Wu, and others led the visitors to inspect the large warehouse of flour on the "California." Workers were unloading flour at the time, working very busily. It is reported that after the ship arrived in Shanghai the day before yesterday, unloading began immediately. Six hundred workers are working day and night, and about 30,000 bags have already been unloaded. All the flour is expected to be unloaded by Saturday of this week, at which time the ship will set sail back to the United States. It is estimated that five large warehouses will be needed to accommodate all the flour. Another ship, the "Nicholas Labadia," carrying 8,700 long tons of wheat, has also arrived in Shanghai and is moored at buoys No. 4 and No. 5, and is currently being unloaded. The wheat is in bulk, and while workers are unloading it, it is being sent to major flour mills in the city to speed up the milling process. All the goods will also take six to eight days to unload.</p>
<p>Chairman Miao Delivers a Speech Expressing Gratitude</p>
<p>After the guests visited the China Merchants Bureau warehouse, Chairman Miao hosted a tea party. During the party, Mr. Miao said in his speech that after the Chinese and American governments signed the agreement on American relief materials worth 30 million U.S. dollars to China on October 27th of last year, both sides intensified their work and prepared separately. The Chinese government organized this committee, and the American government also actively purchased materials necessary for the lives of the Chinese people as relief supplies, especially food, as well as medical supplies and some fertilizers, seeds, etc. I am deeply grateful today as I receive the first shipment of materials here. The transportation and handling of materials over the past two months have been carried out smoothly without delay, thanks to the cooperation between the two governments and the constant exchange of views with Mr. Kirkpatrick, Director of the American United China Relief, and Acting Director Moody. I would like to express my sincere gratitude on behalf of the Chinese government to the American government and its people, as well as to the captain and crew of the ship.</p>
<p>Distribution Committees Established in Five Major Cities</p>
<p>Mr. Miao also reported that the "Hawaii" will arrive in Shanghai on the 26th of this month, carrying 7,000 tons of flour. In addition, the "Washington Mail" and another ship are also scheduled to load grain and come to Shanghai in the second half of this month. All 125,000 tons of relief food will arrive within two to three months. It has now been decided to first establish distribution committees in the five major cities of Nanjing, Shanghai, Chongqing, Beiping, and Tianjin. According to the population of the five cities, the distribution will be carried out in a fair and universal manner, and each person can get five liters of rice per month, which is expected to last for four months. If calculated according to the need for one and a half pecks of rice per person per month, it can solve one-third of the need. The distribution price is slightly lower than the market price and will be adjusted once a month, which can also stabilize part of the price of goods.</p>
<p>All the funds obtained from the distribution will be used for universal relief. This committee has organized two committees, namely the Health and Medical Committee and the Social Relief Committee, which are chaired by the Minister of Social Affairs and the Minister of Health, respectively. Relief agencies in urgent need of these items can apply to this committee. If the facts permit, this committee may also establish its own relief organizations, and funds will be allocated after joint planning and review by Chinese and American experts.</p>
<p>Symbolizing Mutual Love Between the Two Countries</p>
<p>Then, U.S. Consul General Cabot gave a speech, stating that he was very pleased to be able to participate in today's ceremony to receive the first batch of materials upon his arrival here. This relief material symbolizes the mutual love and sincere help between the peoples of the two countries. I firmly believe that the future world will be one in which people who love freedom can live together in peace and prosperity. This food is a gift from the American people to the Chinese people who are currently suffering temporarily, and can be regarded as evidence that the United States is willing to continue to provide relief and restore the post-war order.</p>
<p>Heaven Helps Those Who Help Themselves - Solving Difficulties</p>
<p>Mayor Wu then gave a speech, quoting the phrases "Heaven helps those who help themselves" and "Friendship in adversity," saying that in the current difficulties and hardships of China, on the one hand, we must do our best to help ourselves solve difficulties, and on the other hand, we must rely on our American friends in "friendship in adversity" to continue to supply our country with materials. On behalf of the people of Shanghai, I would like to thank the United States.</p>
<p>Finally, City Council Speaker Pan gave a speech on behalf of the Shanghai City Council, saying that before and after the War of Resistance, China and the United States fought together and became "friends in difficulty." After the war, the Chinese people received the help of "friends in adversity" in construction and reconstruction. This sincere friendship will be forever remembered by the Chinese people. The Shanghai City Council expresses its deep gratitude and welcome to the American relief materials that have been shipped to Shanghai.</p>
<h3>Grain Distribution by Headcount to Begin in February or March - Rice Allocation to Public Servants and Workers to be Abolished at That Time</h3>
<p>(Report from this newspaper) Citywide grain distribution by headcount is scheduled to be implemented from mid-February or early March. At that time, a voucher purchase system will also be implemented. The detailed implementation measures are currently being drafted. Director of the Social Affairs Bureau Wu Kaixian told reporters yesterday that the purpose of implementing this system is to conserve grain consumption. In the future, regardless of their status or occupation, all citizens of the city will be required to consume two pecks of rice per month per person, with a reduction for small households. One peck will be distributed by the government, and one peck will be allowed to be purchased from the free market. The government will issue "distribution certificates" and "purchase certificates" separately. At that time, the method of allocating rice to public servants and industrial workers will be abolished. Restaurants and hotels will be issued a certain amount of rice each month for the consumption of the mobile population without household registration in the city. After the implementation of this system, rice circulation will not be prohibited, but rice shops will not be allowed to sell food to customers without "purchase certificates." The government will check whether rice merchants have cheated based on the quantity of goods they have imported and the purchase certificates they have redeemed. Because every citizen can still buy one peck of rice from a rice shop, the livelihood of rice merchants is not threatened. The government will also control flour to prevent loopholes. If citizens are not accustomed to eating rice but prefer to eat flour, they can declare their intention to buy flour instead when receiving the purchase certificates, calculating one bag of flour for every four pecks of rice. However, once the declaration is confirmed, it cannot be changed. The above-mentioned business is the responsibility of the Civil Food Allocation Committee. The allocation committee currently only presides over the allocation of food for 1.3 million people. Now that it will shoulder the heavy responsibility of food allocation for the city's 5 million citizens, it must be reorganized and expanded.</p>
<h3>Standing Committee Member of the Allocation Committee Goes to Nanjing to Attend a Meeting of the Ministry of Food</h3>

<h3>Social Affairs Bureau Spot Checks Grain Merchants - Registration Temporarily Suspended for Two Months</h3>
<p>(Report from this newspaper) Grain merchants in the city who operate privately without registering and obtaining a license have been ordered to suspend business by the Social Affairs Bureau after consulting with the police bureau. It is now learned that the Social Affairs Bureau is sorting out and spot-checking the households that have already registered, and has specially stipulated that the registration of grain merchants (including processing, warehousing, retail, and other types of grain merchants) will be temporarily suspended for two months from January 21st to March 20th of this year. However, changes to the registration information will still be processed as they arrive and are not subject to this restriction. The bureau has issued notices to all relevant trade associations and announced them to the public.</p>
<h3>Industry Association Calls Again - Open Industrial Loans to Alleviate Emergency</h3>
<p>(Report from this newspaper) The National Federation of Industries recently issued another telegram to Chairman Chiang and the Executive Yuan, calling on the government to open industrial loans as soon as possible to alleviate the urgent needs of various industries, as the Lunar New Year is approaching in the blink of an eye and all industries are in dire need of funds. The original telegram stated that since the government stopped industrial loans, the production circles in various places have felt pain. Although there may have been imperfections in the past in handling industrial loans, one should not stop eating because of choking. Now that the Lunar New Year is not far away, if the government does not provide loans, some factories will be forced to close due to insufficient capital turnover, and the consequences will not only cause workers to lose their jobs, but also seriously affect the entire financial community.</p>

<h3>Safe Deposit Box Found Inside the False Wall of the Bank of Communications</h3>
<p>The Bank of Communications is currently renovating the interior of its building at the intersection of Jiujiang Road and Sichuan Road. The bank has entrusted the Fuchi Construction Company of this city to carry out the construction project. Several days ago, workers from the company discovered a false wall built at the bottom layer while dismantling the left and right walls. The wall was covered with patterned paper. The workers immediately dismantled the false wall and discovered a green safe deposit box. They immediately dispatched personnel to notify the Bank of Communications authorities. After receiving the news, the Bank of Communications authorities, for the sake of prudence, sealed the box for safekeeping and have drafted an official document to report to the bank's authorities for instructions. It is understood that the building was the Russian-owned Daosheng Bank before the First World War. After the end of the First World War, it was converted into the German-owned Dehua Bank. During the period of enemy occupation, it was occupied by financial institutions of the puppet government. After the victory, it was taken over by the Bank of Communications. Therefore, the building has changed hands several times and has undergone many vicissitudes. According to general speculation, this large safe deposit box may have been used to store old items during the First World War. As for the contents of the box, it will be opened and revealed only after instructions from the authorities.</p>

Zhang told him that he did not need to find a job and that he should be responsible for transporting morphine, with a reward of 20,000 yuan for each shipment. For convenience during the journey, he impersonated a colonel. The forged credentials of a colonel staff officer of the Second Department of the Ministry of National Defense, as well as a pistol and twenty-four bullets, were also given to him by Zhang. On December 11th of last year, he accompanied Zhang from Beiping to Shanghai. The morphine was hidden on Zhang Guangyu's person.

<h3>Compensation Materials Arrive Tomorrow: Qin Fen Comes to Shanghai to Preside Over Reception</h3>

<h3>Various Schools Solicit Winter Clothing: Winter Relief Society Prescribes Methods</h3>
<p>[Our Own Report] The Shanghai Winter Relief Committee, because students in various schools have launched solicitations for winter clothing and cash, the procedures and methods are not in accordance with central regulations, which are prone to abuses and will affect the city's unified fundraising and distribution plan. Two handling methods have been decided: 1. Solicitations for winter relief in this city must be issued with receipts from the Winter Relief Committee. If there are no receipts, citizens may not recognize the donations and may not be forced to solicit donations or stop people on the street to donate. Cash that has already been raised should be turned over to the Winter Relief Committee for overall planning and distribution. 2. If schools in the city conduct fundraising in the future, they should follow the above decision-making methods and report in detail the amount of winter clothing and cash that has been raised and the past distribution work to the Winter Relief Committee. Furthermore, when schools distribute winter clothing, they must first contact the Winter Relief Committee to designate the distribution areas to avoid uneven distribution or duplication, and they must request the Municipal Government to order the district chiefs and Baojia chiefs to assist.</p>
<h3>Verdict on Huang Baihui Shooting Case Set for 24th</h3>
<p>Huang Baihui, former owner of the Shih Pao (Times) newspaper, was shot and wounded in the head by two foreign women on the evening of February 18th last year. After recovering in the hospital, he identified Zheng Desheng, a Ningbo native residing at No. 303, Shih Pao Building, as a suspect in instigating the attempted murder. The police immediately arrested Zheng and handed him over to the District Procuratorate, which filed a public indictment against him for instigating attempted murder. Judge Zhong of the Second Criminal Division conducted a secret trial. Yesterday morning at 10:30, the trial continued, with Zheng Desheng's son, Baowen, being questioned first. Zheng continued to deny the charges. Huang Baihui testified that Zheng had attempted to seize his Shih Pao Building property and had privately taken over a large amount of enemy and puppet materials. When the authorities investigated, he suspected Huang of informing on him, leading to the grudge and the shooting. The court then ordered the start of the debate. The plaintiff's lawyer argued that the two foreign women, Jia Siweituo and Moxiu, had no prior animosity with the plaintiff and had never met him. However, they were acquaintances of the defendant. Considering the defendant's grudge against the plaintiff, it was undoubtedly the defendant who instigated the shooting. The lawyer requested that the defendant be punished according to the law and that a civil suit be attached, demanding that the defendant compensate 3,235,000 yuan. The defendant's lawyer then presented the defense. The court declared the debate concluded and scheduled the verdict for 11:00 AM on the 24th.</p>

<h3>Military Police Crack Major Drug Case; Main Culprit is Retired General</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] The large drug trafficking case recently cracked by the 3rd Independent Battalion of the Military Police in this city reportedly involves a retired high-ranking general colluding with active-duty air force personnel to transport drugs. Their organization is very strict. The headquarters is located in Kunming, and the person in charge in Shanghai is a retired army general who once held the position of deputy commander. The seized drugs were found hidden under the spring bed in his home. The case was cracked under the command of the Nanjing Military Police Headquarters, with simultaneous actions taken in Kunming and Shanghai. The main culprits and accomplices in Kunming have also been arrested. In Shanghai, in addition to unscrupulous active-duty air force personnel and a retired army general, a certain Party committee member and a university lecturer involved in selling drugs were also arrested. The drug trafficking organization's transportation network has now been completely dismantled. The sales network is still under investigation, and there may be further developments, so full details cannot be released at this time. It is also understood that because the case involves both Kunming and Shanghai, all suspects will be tried in Nanjing.</p>
<h3>Cheating the Public; Reported by Workers</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] Zhenxing Socks Factory, located at No. 1, Lane 2, Yuqing Lane, North Zhejiang Road, Datong Road, is operated by Cai Zisheng. The factory has ten textile machines and more than ten workers. However, when applying for yarn allocation from the Textile Company, Cai falsely reported having thirty-eight textile machines. Each month, the company allocated fifty packages of 20-count yarn, twenty-eight packages of 32-count yarn, and fourteen packages of 42-count thread. Cai also applied to the Social Affairs Bureau for eight large packages of rice per month for worker rations. The excess yarn and rice were transported to Nanhui to open another factory. Because of slack business at the Shanghai factory, Cai planned to lay off some workers. Worker representative Ling Yingzhen reported the situation to the Social Affairs Bureau. After investigation, the Social Affairs Bureau's Third Section confirmed the report and transferred the case to the District Procuratorate for investigation on fraud charges. Yesterday afternoon, the prosecutor summoned Cai Zisheng for questioning and released him on bail after the interrogation.</p>

<h3>Housing Shortage in Hangzhou</h3>
<p>[Report from our Hangzhou correspondent on the 18th] Due to widespread wartime destruction, there is a housing shortage everywhere after the victory. Although Hangzhou's housing shortage is not as severe as Shanghai's, and gold bars are not demanded at every turn like in Shanghai, this is mainly due to objective conditions. Hangzhou was originally a scenic and political city. In Shanghai, merchants have money and do not care about a few gold bars, but for the average Hangzhou resident, paying millions or tens of millions of yuan to secure a house is already a very substantial burden. Moreover, Hangzhou's rent is calculated in rice. The monthly rent for an ordinary small room requires one or two dan (a unit of weight) of rice. The price of rice fluctuates at any time, which is much higher than the rent in Shanghai. Furthermore, Hangzhou is close to Shanghai and has convenient transportation. Landlords are influenced by Shanghai and always want to</p>
<p>Raise security deposits and rents as much as possible. Therefore, the housing problem has always been a serious issue in Hangzhou. Recently, bandit activities in various counties and villages have led to a trend of population concentration in cities. Hangzhou's population has increased significantly compared to before the war. During the restoration period, the government is dealing with countless issues and has no time to worry about housing, nor does it have the financial resources to build them. As a result, landlords are squeezing even more severely, and the problem has become even more serious.</p>
<p>Last year, the Zhejiang branch of UNRRA also made efforts to alleviate the housing shortage and built a large number of "Post-War Reconstruction Villages." However, they were like a small amount of porridge among many monks, and only a very small number of poor people benefited. Even so, it was UNRRA's greatest effort. The municipal government had also planned to</p>
<p>Build a large number of affordable housing units behind Baoshu Mountain, but it has not yet materialized, while the housing shortage continues to threaten citizens, especially impoverished public servants and teachers. The provincial government recently decided to build public servant housing at Shuitingzhi, which will begin construction soon, but there will only be five buildings in total, which is not enough for allocation. Although the government has clearly ordered that public servant salaries will be issued according to the cost of living index from now on, rent is calculated according to the price of rice, and salaries still cannot keep up. Some public servants' entire monthly income is not even enough to pay rent. They say, "We can barely survive without eating for a day, but if there is a problem with housing for a day, we will have nowhere to live." In order to solve this problem, more than 400 people have signed up to organize a Tenants' Association,</p>
<p>Issue a declaration to appeal to all sectors to uphold justice and unite all tenants to seek effective methods to deal with the situation collectively. This is not only a problem for public servants and teachers themselves, but also a problem that affects all citizens of Hangzhou. Therefore, many people sympathize and respond. In their declaration, they specifically put forward:</p>
<p>Eight demands:</p>
<p>Rent shall not be calculated in rice, nor shall any extraction fees, tips, security deposits, or other similar items be charged.</p>
<p>Rent should be determined and promulgated by the competent authority, inviting representatives from the Housing Association and the Joint Association to form a Hangzhou Rent Collection Committee to set standards.</p>
<p>All vacant houses, except for a few reserved for the landlord's own use, should be rented out completely.</p>
<p>Houses rented for a fixed term shall not be taken back unless the term has expired, and those that have expired shall have the priority of continued rental.</p>
<p>Demand that the government quickly build a large number of affordable houses, such as the houses in Chongqing during the Anti-Japanese War, to benefit the people and avoid the housing shortage.</p>
<p>Demand that the court uphold justice and not make judgments that favor landlords.</p>
<p>Landlords shall not force tenants to move out through illegal means. If landlords are unreasonable, we tenants should also use collective strength to assist those in need.</p>
<p>Request all banks to stop lending to merchants, and the government should order or instruct them to invest in building houses for rent to alleviate the threat of a housing shortage. If these hopes can be thoroughly realized, the housing shortage can be easily solved, and it will not only cease to be "serious" but may also no longer be a "problem."</p>
<p>The public opinion is very supportive of this movement. On the one hand, they demand that the government quickly propose</p>
<p>Solutions to the housing shortage, on the other hand, they appeal to large and secondary landlords to show moral spirit, take a long-term view, and make concessions to the poor citizens and public servants of Hangzhou. Although the joint declaration of public servants and teachers is not a law, it has stirred up waves among the citizens of Hangzhou and has received heartfelt sympathy. It is hoped that the influence of this declaration will at least alleviate the housing shortage in Hangzhou, so that impoverished public servants and citizens will no longer worry about housing day and night, and can focus on serving society.

<h3>Nanhui Election Education Association Established to Encourage People to Vote and Prevent Various Malpractices</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper on the 19th] The Nanhui County Election Education Movement Promotion Association has been established. Responsible persons Chen Tao and others held a reception for reporters at the former Frontline Daily building on Wusong Road in Shanghai today to report on the significance and methods of establishing the association.

It is hoped that this movement will be promoted throughout the country to lay the foundation for the implementation of the constitution in our country.</p>

<h3>Chongming Subsidized Corn; Zhou Qixiang and Others Accused of Embezzlement; Transferred to Fengxian District Court for Trial</h3>
<p>[Report from our Fengxian correspondent on the 17th] Due to the food panic in Chongming County last spring, former County Magistrate Guo invited various institutions to bid with foreign grain merchants for centrally and provincially subsidized corn, and purchased 3,600 dan of corn. He entrusted the county's Grain Association to be responsible for distributing and selling it at subsidized prices. Afterwards, Chen Yonghui and Cai Shaolun, representatives of the Chengqiao Township people, accused the chairman of the association, Zhou Qixiang, in collusion with Wu Qiuping, chairman of the county's Chamber of Commerce, and Huang Yixiao, chairman of the Fisheries Association, of using their positions and opportunities to embezzle the corn. There was no subsidized grain for sale on the market, and the poor did not benefit from it. They reported it to the county's District Procuratorate. After several interrogations, Zhou Qixiang and others were prosecuted for breach of trust. The first public trial was held on November 5th. Subsequently, the defendant applied for a transfer of jurisdiction, and the Suzhou High Court designated this county's District Court to hear the case. Yesterday afternoon (16th) was the date of the public trial. The plaintiffs Chen and Cai, and the defendants Zhou Qixiang and others, all reported on time. Presiding over the trial was Chief Judge Lu of this county's District Court. The plaintiffs stated the above, and a neighborhood chief testified that there was no subsidized sale on the market. According to the defendants Zhou Qixiang, Wu Qiuping, and others, the corn was distributed to the four districts for subsidized sale at a price of 120,000 yuan per dan, entirely for local relief of the food shortage and to suppress grain prices, and there was no embezzlement. After review, Judge Lu ordered a postponement for further interrogation of witnesses.</p>
<h3>Striving for Hunan's Coal Production</h3>
<p>[Report from our Changsha correspondent on the 15th] Coal can be broadly divided into two types: bituminous coal and anthracite. Both are used as fuel. However, bituminous coal contains a high volatile matter content, has a long flame, and often contains oil. Therefore, it is usually used to power machinery and boilers, and is the main fuel for industry and transportation. At the same time, because it contains various chemical substances, it can be obtained through low-temperature distillation to produce various chemical products, such as gasoline, heavy oil, asphalt, and various bright and useful pigments. Therefore, bituminous coal has great value in industry. As for anthracite, its value is less than that of bituminous coal. Anthracite is commonly known as firewood coal, and is also called white coal. It has low volatile matter and is usually only used as a fuel for cooking in households. Therefore, it is an essential commodity for humans, especially in big cities. If there is a bituminous coal shortage, its seriousness is no less than a shortage of rice.</p>
<p>China's coal mines are mostly in the north. The famous ones include Fushun and Kailuan in the northeast, Jingxing in Shanxi, Lincheng in Shandong, Jiaozuo in Anhui and Henan, Fuzhong Company, and Jiawang in Jiangsu. These are all very large coal mines with abundant reserves extending over a very wide area. Before the war, when the output of each mine was at its highest, one mine could produce 25,000 metric tons of coal per day.</p>
<p>The production quantity of northern coal mines is quite considerable. As for Hunan, it has always been known as a land of fish and rice. In principle, it is a rice-producing area, and mineral resources are not expected to be rich. But strangely, Hunan is blessed with unique advantages. On the one hand, it is crisscrossed by lakes and marshes, producing fish and rice; on the other hand, it is covered by mountains and has abundant mineral resources. Leaving aside mineral deposits such as iron and lead, coal is also a major resource in Hunan. Its quantity is naturally less than that of the north, but it is about 1,270 trillion tons, making it the leading province in the southwest.</p>
<p>The growth of coal mines in Hunan varies greatly due to geological conditions. Some are in the form of packages or troughs. Miners call them troughs or seams. Relatively few are evenly spread and widely extended. Geologists divide their distribution into five coal formations: Xiang River, Qianyang, Chenxi, Douling, and Shimenkou. The distribution area is roughly in the Xiang River basin in Weisha, Xiangtan, Ningxiang, Xiangxiang, Liling, Youxian, Hengshan, Hengyang, Changning, Lingling, Leiyang, Yongxing, Zixing, Chenxian, Guiyang, Jiahe, and Linyu. Each county in Yijun, Yiyang, Anhua, Xinhua, Shaoyang, and Wugang in the Zi-Yong River basin, Yuanling, Chenxi, Luxi, Xupu, Qianyang, Huitong, and Zhijiang each county in the Yuan River basin. In addition, Shimen, Cili, Tanxian, Dayong, and Sangzhi also have coal. The distribution is so wide that it can be said to cover the entire province. In the past, Westerners thought that eastern China was full of gold, which was an exaggeration. But it is not an exaggeration to call Hunan</p>
<p>Covered in black coal. It is definitely a 100% fact. Before the war, coal mines in southern Hunan were not valued by the Chinese. Everyone's attention was focused on the north, so Hunan coal was like an abandoned child left by the roadside, ignored by everyone. Even though Hunan had been mining coal for a long time, the scale was incomparable to that of the north. However, times are constantly changing, and this abandoned child-like Hunan coal, since the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, has found it difficult to get coal from the north because the north was harassed by the communists. The north has become a place of turmoil, transportation has been disrupted. Even Qingdao in Shandong which is where the coal came from experienced coal shortages. Everyone then shifted their attention to Hunan, so Hunan coal suddenly embarked on a magnificent journey and became a hundred times more valuable. The development of coal mines in Hunan has achieved amazing results in recent years. The management and operation can be roughly divided into four categories: state-owned, provincial-owned, publicly-owned, and privately-owned. State-owned mines are all managed by the Resources Committee of the Executive Yuan. In addition to the Xiangyong and other mines in Yongxing, which are jointly operated by the government and merchants and produce anthracite coal, the rest of the Lingling Heishankou and Shaoyang Niumasi operated by the Yongshao Coal Mine Bureau, the Xiangtan Tanjishan operated by the Zhonghu Coal Mine Bureau, the Xiangtan Yangjiaqiao operated by the Xiangjiang Coal Mine Company, which is jointly operated by the government and merchants, and the various districts of the Huxiang Coal Mine (operating Yunhu in Xiangtan) and Zhongxiang Coal Mine, which are jointly operated with the provincial government, all produce bituminous coal. The current output of Yongshao is about 3,000 tons per month, and Xiangjiang is about 6,000 tons, totaling about 10,000 tons. In addition, all are</p>
<p>In the equipment preparation period. As for the state-owned mines in Chenxi and Xiangxiang, which have also been designated, construction has not yet begun.</p>
<p>The provincial-owned mines include Liling, Qiyang Guanyintan, and Ningxiang Qingxi. Liling and Qiyang used to produce 15,000 to 16,000 tons per month. However, they were severely damaged during the war. Since they did not request reconstruction funds from the central government, they had to make do with what they had, collecting and repairing some of the remaining damaged machinery to urgently resume operations. Now, Liling can only produce more than 2,000 tons of coal per month, and Guanyintan produces more than 5,000 tons of coal.</p>
<p>Among the publicly-owned coal mines, the largest in scale are the Yangmeishan in Yizhang, Guaguling in Zixing, and Huashi in Xiangtan, which were previously run by Mr. Zeng Yangfu of the Guangzhou Headquarters. The current output is about 16,000 to 17,000 metric tons per month.</p>
<p>In addition, the most coal mines in Hunan are privately-owned coal mines. There are a total of more than 400 privately-owned companies and mines that have been approved and licensed by the government. Those that are still in progress and have not been licensed are not included in the calculation. However, apart from Sanhe in Chenxian, Shouyi, Xunhui in Ningxiang, Hezhu in Chenxi, Huimin, and a few others, which are relatively large in scale, most of the rest are small capital operations without large-scale engineering equipment. The total monthly output of the above four types of mines is less than 50,000 tons, which is a far cry from the 20,000 tons per day produced by each mine in the north in the past. Today, the coal production in the north is on the verge of complete stagnation. Whether the war continues to expand, or even if the war does not spread, some of the original machinery has been moved away. It is already impossible to restore its former glory in the short term. Hunan has gifted coal deposits and a relatively stable situation, which is getting "timing" and "location." If "human harmony" is added, then the description of Hunan coal mines is truly limitless. If coal mines can be developed in Hunan, it will not only benefit the national economy of Hunan Province, but also be related to the needs of national industry and the supply of fuel for military water and land transportation. Therefore, people in Hunan, both in the province and abroad, know to strive for income in this area. The central government is also paying close attention to the development of Hunan coal mines. Vice Chairman Sun Yueqi, who used to travel on the northern roads, also moved to Hunan to inspect, explaining that the central government's view on coal mining is that it is better to start with small quantities in Hunan than to attempt large-scale mining in the north, which is temporarily impossible. As the saying goes, "More in hand is better than more in sight." Moreover, if everyone concentrates their efforts, with Hunan's abundance of coal deposits, it is not impossible to increase production by 10,000 to 20,000 tons per day. From Hunan's economic standpoint, striving for Hunan coal production is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity today. We should seize this opportunity and not let it slip away!

<h3>Government to Purchase Various Major Export Goods in the Short Term; Purchase Price to be Determined by a Review Committee Composed of Finance and Economic Departments</h3>
<p>The matter of the government continuing to purchase major domestic export commodities has been approved by the Review Committee of the National Economic Council. Yesterday, the person in charge of the Import and Export Control Committee gave further explanations, stating that this measure is not an absolute purchase method but rather one of the export promotion methods. After implementation, there will be three characteristics:</p>
<p>The purchasing method this time is entirely flexible. The time for determining flexibility is authorized by the government to the Import and Export Control Committee for implementation, so that there will no longer be a disconnect from reality.</p>
<p>The commodities to be purchased were originally set at seven agricultural products, but now the scope has been expanded. All agricultural products that cannot be exported can be purchased, and special industrial raw materials that cannot be exported can also be purchased.</p>
<p>The determination of the purchase price is decided by a pricing committee composed of the Ministry of Finance, the Audit Department, the Ministry of Economic Affairs, the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, the Joint Relief and Rehabilitation Administration, the Central Bank, the Central Trust Bureau, and the Import and Export Control Committee. After the decision is made, the Central Trust Bureau is responsible for implementing the purchase. This flexible method can be implemented after being approved by the Executive Yuan meeting.</p>
<h3>Yarn Control Committee Principally Agrees to Cotton Merchants' Proposed Purchasing Plan; Representatives Visit Chairman Yuan Again Yesterday to Discuss Further</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] Cotton Merchant Association representatives Liu Pingsun, Zheng Zhezheng, and others visited Chairman Yuan of the Yarn Control Committee at 11:00 AM yesterday to further discuss the matter of entrusting cotton merchants to purchase cotton. It is reported that Chairman Yuan principally agreed to the three purchasing plans proposed by the cotton merchants. The Yarn Control Committee has also drafted a contract entrusting cotton merchants to purchase cotton, which will be sent to the Cotton Merchant Association today. The Cotton Merchant Association will submit it for discussion at the subcommittee meeting to be held at 2:00 PM this afternoon and will actively prepare to establish a joint cotton merchant organization to serve as a bridge between the Yarn Control Committee and the industry.</p>
<p>It is reported that the principle of entrusting purchases is that each contracting cotton merchant must provide physical goods (limited to cotton yarn and cloth) or credit (yarn factory or other equivalent credit guarantee). The amount of cotton to be purchased will be determined based on the size of the guarantee.</p>
<p>The amount of raw cotton to be entrusted for the first batch of purchases has been fixed at one million municipal dans. The period is from February to August of this year. The funds for the first period (one month as one period) of entrusted purchases are estimated at one trillion yuan. Officials from the Yarn Control Committee stated that allocating funds is not a problem.</p>

The committee's regulations for cotton yarn and cloth management have been drafted and will be actively implemented soon.</p>
<p>Yarn Prices Fall Back</p>
<p>Yesterday, the cotton yarn market situation saw light trading due to tight credit both within and outside the industry, weak demand from weaving factories, and few purchases from brokerage firms. It was also reported that the negotiated price for China Textile Building's allocation might be reduced, which led to a subdued mood and lower asking prices.</p>
<p>By the end, 42-count Blue Phoenix fine yarn fell by 1 million compared to the weekend, to 58.5 million yuan. Other counts of fine yarn also fell back by 300,000 to 1.5-1.6 million yuan.</p>
<p>Cloth Market Mediocre</p>
<p>Yesterday, the cotton cloth market saw slightly more purchasing from brokerage firms, especially from the Piji Hankou Ningbo and other firms, which absorbed 10-20 pieces. Shanxi firms also made a few purchases, and the market sentiment was positive. However, after the purchases, credit tightened again, and many long positions were sold, causing prices to soften slightly.</p>
<p>As a result, 12-pound Dragon Head fine cloth settled at 1.6 million yuan. Colorful Balls rose by 5,000 yuan, while Five Blessings, Yang Crane, and others fell back by 15,000 yuan. Piji Zhigong rose by 17,000 to 25,000 yuan, while other cloths showed mixed performance.</p>

<p>Spot Cotton Continues to Weaken</p>
<p>Yesterday, trading in the spot cotton market remained low, and most businesses were cautious due to tight credit.

Lingbao opened at 625,000 yuan for in-warehouse delivery, Shashi at 5,456,000 yuan, Huo Ji factory delivery price opened at 4,630,000 yuan, and Zhoupu seed cotton at 1.14 million yuan.</p>
<p>Chinese Stocks Weak in Morning Trading, Recover and Stabilize in the Afternoon</p>
<p>Chinese stocks were initially weak and then stabilized yesterday. Credit conditions influenced the overall situation. In the middle of the session, Yong Yarn Association broke through the 700 yuan mark, making people easily agitated, but buying interest was not completely extinguished. In the afternoon, there was a turnaround, and the market showed signs of strength.</p>
<p>The morning was unfavorable, and apart from Matches, which remained flat, all other stocks weakened. Yong Yarn opened at 715 yuan and 746 yuan and rose to highs of 734 yuan and 758 yuan after the opening. Because there were many offers for immediate delivery, off-market interest rates opened at 30 and 34.5 yuan, and the prices retreated to 710 yuan and 732 yuan. Afterwards, the prices fluctuated and stabilized. Near noon, the market broke through the 700 yuan mark, and many retail investors were forced to liquidate, pushing the prices down to lows of 696 yuan and 718 yuan. The afternoon close was 699 yuan and 725 yuan. As a result, compared to last Saturday, immediate delivery shares of China Flour, Xinyi, Datong, and Rongfeng each fell by 10%.

Then, the prices further advanced to highs of 730 yuan and 750 yuan. At this time, selling pressure emerged, and the prices retreated to 712 yuan and 730 yuan. The closing prices were 730 yuan and 750 yuan. As a result, compared to the morning close, immediate delivery shares of Rongfeng, Xinhe, Meiya, Huafeng, Innerwear, and Zhongfa each rose by 5%, China Silk rose by 10%, and the rest rose slightly.

<h3>Inflationary Trend Slows Slightly</h3>
<p>Recently, the inflationary trend of various prices in this city has slightly decreased. According to the Oriental Economic Research Institute, the retail price index of essential daily necessities in this city for the past week (January 12th to 17th) is as follows:</p>
<p>Food category: 119,911 times, an increase of 0.135% compared to the previous week.</p>

<p>Overall index: 144,530 times, an increase of 0.128% compared to the previous week.</p>
<p>In total, among daily necessities in the past week, the fuel category saw the largest increase due to the reduced supply of fuel, followed by the food category. The clothing category saw the least increase because previous increases were too drastic and consumers' purchasing power was weakening, leading to lower sales.</p>
<h3>Record High Check Returns: 848.2 Billion Last Week</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Clearing House announced yesterday (January 19th) that the total amount of returned checks for the second week of this year, January 12th to 17th, was 848.2 billion yuan, an increase of 489.4 billion yuan compared to the amount of returned checks in the first week.</p>
<h3>National Bonds Decline, Foreign Stocks Recover Slightly</h3>
<p>Public bonds were still difficult to rally confidence yesterday and declined significantly. National B opened at 85,000 in the morning, reaching a low of 74,000, and finally hovered around 78,000. Chengde sold 360 and 520, yarn and flower brokers bought from 503, and bought 550 and 555, with a transaction volume of about 3 million.

<h3>Out-of-Town Cash Flows into This City: Totals Over 700 Billion Yuan</h3>
<p>Since the beginning of the month, cash from various cities outside of Shanghai has been flowing into the city. According to estimates from the financial community, as of now, the amount of cash flowing into Shanghai has reached a huge 700 billion yuan, resulting in a severe shortage of cash in various cities outside of Shanghai, especially in North China, including Tianjin and other places. The financial industry in those areas is facing difficulties, and credit is extremely tight, even more so than in Shanghai.</p>
<p>In order to eliminate this drawback, the financial authorities have strictly ordered customs and other sea, land, and air enforcement personnel to intensify their inspections of illegal cash smuggling into Shanghai. Once discovered, they will be severely punished according to the law, without leniency. At the same time, they are also discussing strict and concrete measures to ban it.</p>
<p>Credit Extremely Tight</p>
<p>Recently, credit has been extremely tight. Even smaller banks and firms have been unable to balance their accounts due to their inability to obtain even a few tens of thousands of yuan in cash, resulting in balancing their accounts late into the night. According to the person in charge of the Business Bureau of the Central Bank, there are two reasons for this:</p>
<p>In the past, when the Central Bank tightened credit, there were more remittances from various cities in the interior, so credit was not as tight as it is now. Recently, the credit in Tianjin, Hankou, and other places is also very tight, and they can no longer remit the surplus funds to Shanghai, thus causing credit in this city to be even tighter.</p>
<p>Amid the extreme credit crunch, black market interest rates have reached as high as 30%. A small number of banks and firms, tempted by high interest rates, have released surplus funds. However, during a credit crunch, it is often difficult to recover loans, which quickly affects the banks and firms themselves. Under these circumstances, the national banks are working to regulate market needs and will not deliberately allow prices in this city to skyrocket due to loose credit before the Lunar New Year, so that people can safely pass the Lunar New Year.</p>
<h3>Banks and Firms Should Report Details of Their Current Account Holders</h3>
<p>In order to prevent banks and firms from abusing checks, the Shanghai Financial Administration of the Ministry of Finance has specially stipulated that banks and firms should submit the addresses and names of their current account holders separately before the end of this month for verification. If the bureau deems that there are suspicious circumstances, it will order the banks and firms to stop opening accounts.</p>
<h3>Business License Fees for Customs Brokers Increased Tenfold</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] The Jianghai Customs announced yesterday that the business license fee and renewal fee stipulated in Article 4 of the revised Customs Broker Management Regulations, and the deposit stipulated in Article 5 of the same regulations, will be charged at ten times the original amount from January 1st of this year.</p>
<p>Furthermore, from today until February 20th, is the period for customs brokers to re-register. Customs brokers who wish to continue operating a customs brokerage business must complete the procedures at the General Affairs Section of this customs office within the above deadline and pay the new amount of the deposit and renewal fee to exchange for a new license. Those who fail to do so by the deadline will be considered unregistered and their business operations will be suspended.</p>
<h3>Appendix 3A Surcharge Rate to be Publicly Announced by the Central Trust Bureau</h3>

D-grade split-bundle prices were 95 million yuan, E-grade split-bundle prices were 3.5 million yuan, A-grade loose bundles were 3 million yuan, and mid-grade loose bundles were 1 million yuan, with a few bundles traded. Asking prices for dried rayon remained unchanged.</p>
<p>Silk Fabrics</p>
<p>The market was firm yesterday. "Huaqiang" pure silk quilt covers had the largest instant transaction at 1.3 million yuan, closing firm at 1 million yuan for instant sales, and 1.4 million yuan for forward dates. Other silk fabrics did not experience any price fluctuations due to the lack of movement in raw material prices.</p>
<h3>Huainan and Huadong Coal Mines to Ship Large Quantities of Coal to Shanghai</h3>
<p>To ensure that there is no shortage of coal supply in this city, the Fuel Management Committee dispatched the head of the Transportation Department, Wu Xianying, to Nanjing to seek instructions from the Ministry of Communications and to contact the Jinpu Railway Bureau in Xuzhou regarding transportation and to inspect the production and coal storage situation at the Huainan and Huadong coal mines.</p>
<p>Wu returned to Shanghai yesterday and told reporters: Train cars have been secured with the Jinpu Railway Bureau and coal is already being loaded in Xuzhou for transportation to Pukou. The current coal reserves at the Huainan and Huadong coal mines are over 100,000 tons, and all of it can be transported to Pukou before mid-next month, then loaded onto ships and transported to Shanghai for supply.</p>
<p>The output and transportation capacity of other Taiwanese coal and small coal mines in Jiangxi, Hunan, Hubei, Sichuan, Shandong, and other places run by private merchants are also being strengthened simultaneously. Therefore, the most serious coal shortage problem in this city can be easily resolved, it is believed.</p>
<h3>Rice Market Active - Coarse Grains and Oil Markets Decline</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the rice market situation rotated upwards. Prices in the North City Market increased by 20,000 yuan compared to last Saturday. Due to the sluggish market in recent days, speculators decreased, and the floating goods on the market were exhausted. Some owners were unwilling to sell at lower prices, leading to an intention to support prices. Traders who had been observing for many days were also more eager to replenish their stock, and as sales became more active, prices gradually increased. Wuxi white japonica rice reappeared at 1.4 million yuan, and thin rice and early rice both increased by 20,000 yuan. Special grade high japonica rice was 1.44 million yuan, Danyang white yuan rice was 1.51 million yuan, and other indica rice also held firm. The South City Market opened steadily, but after hearing about the rise in the North City Market, the market also turned firm. As a result, early rice and other types slightly increased by 10,000 to 20,000 yuan, while white japonica rice remained at its original price. Yesterday's arrivals were 9,146 shih in the South City Market and 10,571 shih in the North City Market.</p>
<p>Flour continued to decline. The northern varieties lacked demand, actual sales were weak, and retailers continued to sell off stock, resulting in an increasingly sluggish market. "Warship" brand flour was 540,000 yuan, down more than 10,000 yuan from last week. "Old Car" brand flour only decreased by 2,000 yuan due to the scarcity of goods, with limited transactions. Other miscellaneous brands of flour uniformly weakened. Wheat bran rose by 10,000 yuan yesterday after a rapid decline. The factory price for wheat opened at 800,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Coarse grains generally turned upward, with only a few declining. Soybeans lacked demand, and the market was flat and weak. Corn and mung beans were purchased in considerable quantities by Qingdao traders, each rising by 40,000 to 50,000 yuan. Red sorghum was average, cowpeas were also actively sold in the north, rising by 10,000 yuan. Adzuki beans saw little transaction, and the market was stable. Sesame saw a slight increase, and the price of raw peanuts remained largely unchanged.</p>
<p>Edible oil declined. The arrival of raw soybean oil continued, actual sales were sluggish, and the supply exceeded market demand, resulting in a price decline. Soybean oil fell by 70,000 to 80,000 yuan immediately after the market opened. Except for "Dayouyu" factory soybean oil, which opened at 2.82 million yuan, other factories all opened at 2.8 million yuan, and the market stabilized afterwards. Raw oil decreased slightly by 50,000 yuan, and the market situation was firmer than soybean oil. Jiangbei and Qingdao "Lucky Barrel" raw oil each opened at 3.2 million yuan, down 50,000 yuan from last Saturday. Barrelled cooked rapeseed oil fell by 100,000 yuan, raw rapeseed oil fell slightly by 50,000 yuan, and "Lucky Barrel" small-cart sesame oil was traded at 3.15 million yuan, also down 100,000 yuan. Soybean cake prices remained largely unchanged.</p>
<h3>Initial Drop in Sugar Futures</h3>
<p>The sugar market experienced a small correction yesterday due to tight credit conditions. Both futures and spot sugar prices declined.</p>
<p>The association's pricing was as follows: 24 coarse white sugar spot price was 1.75 million yuan to 1.72 million yuan, and secondary grade was 1.7 million yuan to 1.67 million yuan. 20 medium granulated white sugar was 1.72 million yuan to 1.65 million yuan.</p>
<p>Taiwan red sugar was 2 million yuan to 2.15 million yuan, semi-white sugar was 1.71 million yuan to 1.65 million yuan, and grass bag sugar was 1.62 million yuan to 1.6 million yuan.</p>
<p>Taiwan green sugar was 1.4 million yuan. Futures coarse white and cart white sugar fluctuated by as much as 50,000 to 60,000 yuan, recovering 20,000 to 30,000 yuan in the afternoon.</p>
<p>Local sugar was quoted at 1.6 million yuan, Hainan red sugar was 1.65 million yuan, Xinghua white sugar was 1.72 million yuan to 1.7 million yuan, and sugar was 1.635 million yuan.</p>
<h3>Tea Market Transactions Limited</h3>
<p>Since the price surge in the tea market has been expanding continuously, the market yesterday was characterized by sellers hoarding and trying to sell at high prices. Although the urge to do so continued unabated, buyers were deterred by the high prices and adopted a wait-and-see attitude.</p>
<p>Throughout the day, transactions were not as active or vibrant as last week, but there was a hidden firmness in the market. Due to variations in the quality of the goods, there was no significant price increase, but the base remained solid.</p>
<h3>Cigarettes Initial Firmness Followed by Decline</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the cigarette market saw buyers initially taking advantage of low prices to absorb stock, with robust sales. Prices rose in a roundabout manner. In the afternoon, due to news of goods being distributed, dealers had tight positions and sold off a lot at high prices. As a result, the final prices of the top ten "Great Britain" and "Old Knife" cigarettes continued to decline by 100,000 to 300,000 yuan compared to the weekend. In addition, the prices of various Chinese and foreign cigarettes also mostly decreased with only a few increases.</p>
<p>Soap Flat and Weak</p>
<p>In the daily necessities soap market, due to the reduction in fixed allocation quotas, dealers strengthened their absorption, and there was an urgent need to cover short positions. New buyers also became active. As a result, "Fixed Capital" soap rebounded by 5,000 yuan compared to the weekend, "Arrow Knife" soap declined by 20,000 yuan, "Huang Xiangmao" soap increased by 10,000 yuan, and the rest were flat and weak. Old miscellaneous brands of matches were down by 100,000 yuan. Kerosene and candles showed a fair market.</p>
<h3>Woolen Fabrics Weak Customer Sales</h3>
<p>In previous years, around this time, customer demand for woolen fabrics was strong. Although orders for autumn and winter goods had already been placed, spring goods continued to arrive. The current situation is different, with few customers from near and far placing orders. The main reasons are that Shanghai market prices have risen sharply, and most have become inverted. Secondly, the internal unrest is not yet resolved, transportation is hampered, and remittances and discounts are related. The heavy cost of capital, high interest rates, and large public and private expenses, making business difficult, are also major factors.</p>
<h3>Traditional Chinese Medicine Stock Scarcity Price Increase</h3>
<p>There has been a recent turnaround in the traditional Chinese medicine market, with prices for goods from Niuzhuang, Tianjin, and Sichuan mostly rising. The reason is that wholesale merchants in various places have weak inventory levels, and customers are searching for goods. Shanghai stocks are also scarce, and the supply route is not smooth, resulting in a situation where demand exceeds supply. The market is expected to continue to rise. If the New Year's "Red Sound" period arrives, the market situation should be even more bullish.</p>
<p>Recently, Fleshy Maple suddenly jumped by 44,000 yuan, and the market is searching for goods. Forsythia is 2.8 million per pair, a very strong upward trend. Laiyang Ginseng is 18 million on the Shanghai large bundle market, and is still active, while small bundles are not available.</p>

<h3>On "Sincerity"</h3>
<p>— Impartiality</p>
<p>The Essence of "Sincerity"</p>
<p>Zhu Xi said: "Why was the Doctrine of the Mean written? Zisi was concerned that the Way would be lost and not transmitted, so he wrote it" (Preface to the Doctrine of the Mean). Whether the Doctrine of the Mean was truly written by the sage's grandson Zisi is something I do not have time to discern. Examining its content, it was written by Confucian scholars during the transition from the Qin to the Han Dynasties. Its intention was to transmit the teachings of their master Confucius, which is undoubtedly the case. Confucian thought had reached its culmination at this point. His disciples compiled the entire system into a book to benefit future generations. Therefore, the book begins with the Way of Heaven and ends with edification. All the problems it addresses, such as ontology, cosmology, ethics, politics, and education, often reveal the ultimate principles, paving the way for future generations. Summarizing its teachings, everything is connected by "Sincerity." Therefore, "Sincerity" is the main thread of the entire book. Understanding this will lead to a more than half-understanding of the meaning of this book. Regardless of my shallowness, I have compiled the words on "Sincerity" and explored their meaning to engage with scholars.</p>
<p>"Sincerity is the Way of Heaven." The Way of Heaven is nothing but truth. Therefore, "Sincerity" is simply truth. This truth can be known and practiced by people. Therefore, it continues by saying: "To realize sincerity is the Way of Man." "To realize sincerity" is like seeking truth. It is not only about seeking it, but all thoughts and actions should also be based on it as a standard. This is the way to be human, hence it is called "The Way of Man." Truth comes from Heaven, and people can know and use it as a standard because it shares the same source as the way followed by all things. The Way of Heaven is nothing but truth, and human thoughts and actions, as well as the movement and stillness, formation and destruction of things, are all encompassed by the Way of Heaven and are part of truth. This is the unity of Heaven and Man, and the commonality of all beings. The reason why people can know Heaven and Earth and all things is precisely because Heaven, Earth, and all beings originally belong to one entity. This is the foundation for the generation of knowledge, the key to its existence, and what Confucian scholars throughout the ages have tacitly agreed upon.</p>
<p>The Way of Man comes from the Way of Heaven. The "Sincerity" of the Way of Man originates from the "Sincerity" of the Way of Heaven. Therefore, ethics, politics, and education are the Way of Heaven manifested in human affairs, and the "Sincerity" of the Way of Heaven is seen in human affairs. Is this not the "consistent" Way that Confucian scholars speak of?</p>
<p>Then, where does the "Sincerity" of the Great Way come from? It says: "Sincerity is self-completion; and the Way, self-direction." "Sincerity is self-completion" means that truth is inherently truth, and it brings itself into being without being made so. This speaks of the inherent nature of the Way of Heaven, which is static. Then it says "The Way, self-direction," which speaks of its activation and flow, which is dynamic. "Self-direction" means that its activation and flow are natural, and there is nothing outside of this Way that directs or controls it. The Way of Heaven is like "Sincerity," which is the order that all things follow without fail. This is the essence of the universe, and its activation and flow are purely natural. The universe and all things originate from nature, and their movement, stillness, formation, and destruction all follow the laws of nature. There is no supernatural master who sets the stage for creation before the beginning and holds the reins of evolution after the beginning. If one insists on the existence of a master, then it must be said that it resides within the universe and all things, and the universe and all things are its manifestations. The so-called "Way" is its self-creation, self-preservation, and the inevitable laws of nature. From this, it can be seen that our Confucian ontology and cosmology are closer to Western naturalism and pantheism. As for its view of life, which emphasizes contentment and acceptance of fate, it is a natural consequence of the naturalistic and pantheistic ontology and cosmology, and it also coincides with Western determinism.</p>
<p>"Sincerity" is the essence. The essence activates and flows to form the universe and all things. Therefore, it is said: "Sincerity is the end and the beginning of things; without sincerity, there would be nothing." "Sincerity" is the ultimate Way and principle of Heaven and Earth. The reason why things are things is that they all receive the ultimate Way and principle of Heaven and Earth as their order and boundaries. Therefore, it is said: "Without sincerity, there would be nothing." Furthermore, the formation of things has its reasons, and its destruction also has its causes. These reasons and causes are none other than the ultimate principles of Heaven and Earth. Therefore, it is said: "Sincerity is the end and the beginning of things."</p>
<p>In humans, "Sincerity" becomes nature and virtue. Fully developing one's virtue leads to becoming a complete person, and extending one's virtue to others leads to the completion of things. The Doctrine of the Mean says: "Sincerity is not only about completing oneself, but also about completing things. Completing oneself is benevolence; completing things is wisdom; these are the virtues of nature." The "Sincerity" of the Way of Heaven is bestowed upon humans and becomes their nature and virtue. Virtue is what makes a person human, and if virtue is lacking, one cannot become a complete person. "Sincerity" is like "realizing sincerity," which means seeking sincerity and establishing sincerity. Seeking sincerity is for understanding the principles of Heaven and Earth and knowing how much of this Way and principle one has received. Establishing sincerity is for preserving what one has received from Heaven as a human being, ensuring that nothing is lost. If one can do this, one will naturally become a complete person. Things and I are both created by Heaven and Earth, like siblings. Siblings share the same parents, which is a small division. Things and I share the same Heaven and Earth, which is a large division. Things and I depend on each other for existence, just as siblings depend on each other for life. Therefore, having completed oneself, one must also have a way to complete things. Therefore, it is said: "It is not only about completing oneself, but also about completing things." Completing oneself leads to becoming a person. Benevolence is the virtue of a person. Therefore, it is said: "Completing oneself is benevolence." To complete things, one must extend oneself to others. This involves knowing one's own nature and knowing the nature of things. Thus, knowledge is valued. Therefore, it is said: "Completing things is wisdom." Benevolence and wisdom are obtained from Heaven and exist in nature as virtues. Therefore, it is said: "These are the virtues of nature."</p>
<h3>Experiment and Observation</h3>
<p>— Chen Li</p>
<p>In the first issue of this publication, in the discussion of "The Division Between Ancient and Modern Science," the importance of experiment in modern science was mentioned. However, due to space limitations, the discussion was not detailed. Here, I add a few more words, but I can only speak to a small point of the spirit of experiment.</p>
<p>Experiment is doing something with a purpose, which is different from observation, which is doing something without a purpose. Experiment must first have a hypothesis, and this hypothesis is used to solve a certain problem. Experiment is arranging some conditions to confirm whether this hypothesis works. In the experimenter's mind, this hypothesis can solve this problem. Sometimes, scientists will also use the method of proof by contradiction, that is, using "does not work" to confirm a hypothesis, but the meaning is not very different. The spirit of science lies in not recognizing one's personal fantasies as truth, but in bowing one's head and asking nature for answers. But "what does Heaven say?" Nature is like a dumb person who cannot speak. When you ask it, it will only make "yes" or "no" gestures, or else, it will wave its hands and feet in confusion, not knowing what to say. In other words, scientists must arrange some conditions so that the result is "either this or that," which is the crucial test mentioned in science. Therefore, experiment is like a kind of dialogue, a dialogue between man and nature. Ancient science—such as Greek philosophy—was a dialogue between people.</p>
<p>We compare experiment to a kind of dialogue, which can very well demonstrate the special spirit of experiment. Experiment is not the behavior of humankind alone, nor is it the behavior of nature alone—it is not purely logical reasoning, nor is it purely empirical fact. We interrogate nature, which is human initiative, that is, the subjectivity of experiment. But after the question is asked, we can only wait for nature's answer, where people can do nothing, which is the objectivity of experiment. Experiment is really a unification of subjectivity and objectivity. Some people only look at the subjective or objective side, which clearly shows that they have not understood the essence of the modern scientific method.</p>
<p>Science in the past was translated as "investigation of things." The saying "investigate things to attain knowledge" can be regarded as China's ancient science. Wang Yangming's story of investigating bamboo is a good example. His disciples and he stared at bamboo for three or seven days, trying to investigate some physics, but in the end, they only became physically exhausted and still did not understand anything. The reason is that they were too attached to the objective, wanting nature to speak without asking questions. "Investigating the principles of things," if "investigating things" only refers to "staring blankly at things," this is passive waiting, not active interrogation. This is not a dialogue, this is just a solo performance. What is pitiful is that the protagonist of this solo performance is a mute—silent nature. How can such a play be successful? The Yangming school saw that such a play would not succeed, so they made a 180-degree turn and advocated "the mind is principle," or said "I am nature." In this way, self-praise, self-questioning, and self-answering, the dialogue between man and nature, becomes a person's soliloquy, which is consistent with the spirit of ancient Greek dialogue. The dialogue of ancient Greek philosophers, in form, is a debate between people, but in fact, it is still an individual's soliloquy. From this perspective, ancient science, whether Chinese or Western, is a personal dialogue. The division between ancient and modern science is clear here.</p>
<p>The problem with the Lu-Wang school is that it tends to be too extreme, which makes them fall into difficulty themselves. At first, they only observed, without asking questions, and as a result, they did not get any answers—this is getting trapped in the mud of pure objectivity. Later, they completely asked and answered themselves—this is getting trapped in subjective fantasy. Scientists should be like Ibsen said, "I do not answer, my job is to ask questions." The problem with observation is exposed here. Observation may be doing something without a purpose, and general anecdotal records are like this. When recording, it is doing something with a purpose, but the observation on which it is based is doing something without a purpose. It is just like a person walking on the street and occasionally seeing two people fighting. He looks at it out of curiosity and then walks away. The next day, he is summoned to court to testify. The judge asks him some specific questions, and he answers to the best of his memory and conscience, but how reliable is his testimony? Psychology tells us that it is rarely reliable. Therefore, the materials of observation are often not very good evidence. Furthermore, even if observation is doing something with a purpose, it often cannot obtain very precise principles. The reason is that observation often cannot force nature to give a definite answer. It cannot arrange conditions to make nature give a clear-cut answer. Nature in such circumstances often answers ambiguously. Many people, because of the ambiguity of nature's answers, even advocate not using observation. This is equivalent to the Western proverb, "Don't throw the baby out with the bathwater." In other words, it is not that observation is wrong, but that imprecise observation is wrong. In fact, experiment is still observation—observation under controlled conditions. Therefore, we say that ancient science also used observation, which refers to observation in a broad sense. The observation of modern science is the observation of experiment, which can also be said to be observation in a narrow sense. This distinction of observation fully illustrates the main difference between ancient and modern science.</p>
<h3>The First Year of UNESCO</h3>
<p>— Wang Chengxu</p>
<p>The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) has just held its second general conference in Mexico City. The author knows this newly established international organization very well, from its conception to its birth. When the first general conference was held in Paris in November of the year before last, the author also participated in the plan for the first year of its existence in its old home near the Arc de Triomphe.</p>
<p>The establishment of UNESCO has been more than a year now. It was born to build a fortress for world peace. Its advocates hold great hopes for it. Therefore, the plans that were laid out were almost too much for this fragile newborn to handle. Each of its departments - education, natural sciences, social sciences, literature and art, philosophy, libraries and museums, and mass communication - has drafted large plans, fully expressing fervent idealism.</p>
<p>The head nurse of this newborn is the British scientist Huxley, and its nannies are all experienced experts. In the first four months of the past year, they observed its capabilities and formulated a more practical work plan, which was implemented conscientiously. Let us review its achievements in the past year.</p>
<p>Its first task was to assist in the recovery of education and culture in countries affected by war. It contacted many international organizations engaged in educational rehabilitation and established an International Educational Relief Committee. The donations they raised have reached 60 million US dollars, as well as donations in kind. Although it is new, it has done a lot of work. We can only briefly list a few important things:</p>
<p>Investigating the mass communication industries - news, film and broadcasting - in more than ten countries for their general and technical needs.</p>
<p>Organizing a six-week summer workshop for teachers from various countries in Fêvre near Paris. Representatives of teachers from various countries participated in it, using the power of education to promote international understanding. The work of education is the backbone of UNESCO's work. It launched the World Fundamental Education Movement. In this world where half the population is illiterate, peace is difficult to achieve. In this movement, it edited a book on fundamental education as a guide for implementation. (This book has been translated by the author and published by the Commercial Press.) The Fundamental Education Research Conference held in Nanjing last September was launched by it. Pilot fundamental education areas are currently being planned in China, Haiti and East Africa. Proceeding in parallel with the fundamental education movement is the textbook reform movement. Collecting textbooks from various countries, analyzing and studying improvements.</p>
<p>Sending scientists to South America, the Middle East, and the Far East to establish scientific cooperation centers to communicate scientific research. The Far East scientific cooperation center is in China.</p>
<p>Establishing scholarships to encourage and assist scholars from various countries in academic and technical research.</p>
<p>Holding an international theater conference in Paris to decide on the establishment of an International Theater Research Institute, formulate organizational regulations, and establish domestic committees in various countries to communicate with each other.</p>
<p>Assisting the United Nations Human Rights Commission in drafting the Declaration of Human Rights.</p>
<p>Publishing publications to communicate the actual work of UNESCO.</p>
<p>Establishing contacts and cooperation with international organizations such as the Geneva International Bureau of Education.</p>
<p>Starting the investigation and research of "Art for Education" and "Art for Society."</p>
<p>Proceeding with the translation of world masterpieces.</p>
<p>The above points are not to be seen as plans, but as things that have actually been done. Huxley proudly presented these reports to the representatives of various countries participating in the second general conference.</p>
<p>After reflecting on the past, we must look to the future. What does UNESCO plan to do in the second year of its life? UNESCO put forward the following four points in the general conference:</p>
<p>Improving the educational, scientific, and cultural standards of various countries. Science is a unified human activity, while art and culture are diverse. Therefore, UNESCO is unifying and accelerating scientific research and its application on the one hand, while maintaining the uniqueness of the cultures of various countries and seeking mutual understanding on the other.</p>
<p>The free flow of ideas. This not only refers to passively breaking down barriers, but also actively establishing information and publishing agencies - newspapers, magazines, movies, and broadcasting - in various countries.</p>
<p>Seeking international understanding through education.</p>
<p>Increasing the practical participation of various countries.</p>
<p>In addition, the compilation of the history of human culture and science, the study of the material and psychological factors of war, the comparative study of university education in various countries, and the international significance of family and social design are all within the work plan for 1948.</p>
<p>UNESCO is one of the most successful international organizations after the war. We hope it will fulfill its mission of the times.</p>
<h3>From Philosophy to Politics</h3>
<p>— Xie Youwei</p>
<p>——Russell's Autobiography, Part 3——</p>
<p>The fame of British philosopher Bertrand Russell seems to lie not in his mathematics or philosophy, but in his political activities and political thought. He is not a man confined to the monastery. He does not want to talk about his philosophy only in an ivory tower. He has a strong political interest. He grew up in a family with a strong political atmosphere, and his elders all hoped that he would engage in political activities. This, of course, could not but have some influence on him. Therefore, in his autobiography, Russell talks about politics and education from philosophy.</p>
<p>Russell believes that his political interests are second only to his academic interests. Although he chose philosophy as his main work, he could not completely forget politics. In 1895, when he was in Berlin, he carefully studied German social democratic politics. He liked this political proposition because it opposed the German emperor, but he did not like it because it combined Marx's orthodox theory. For a time, he was influenced by Sidney Webb, who was an imperialist and even supported British colonial wars. However, by 1901, he had completely abandoned this imperialist thought. Since then, he has been very reluctant to use force to resolve disputes between people, although he believes that the use of force is sometimes necessary. In 1903, when Joseph Chamberlain opposed free trade, Russell stood on the position of an internationalist to oppose Chamberlain. He also actively participated in the movement to win the right to vote for women. In 1910, he intended to participate in the election of members of parliament, but the matter failed when the nomination committee discovered that he was a free thinker.</p>
<p>When the First European War broke out, Russell was an anti-war activist. His anti-war remarks and writings were quite dissatisfied with the British government. He was eventually imprisoned for a time because of this, and at the same time, he became widely known to the world because of this. During the war, he hoped that this European war could end future wars, but after the Treaty of Versailles was concluded, he knew that there was no hope. Many of Russell's friends sympathized with the Soviet Union, but after he went to the Soviet Union in 1920, he found that the Soviet Union had nothing that could make him happy or worship. He said: "I think the Bolshevik philosophy is very unpleasant, not because it is communist, but because it shares the elements of Western financial giants." He was invited to lecture and lived in China for almost a year. He had a very good impression of China. He said: "I love the Chinese, but the result of the Chinese resisting hostile militarism will obviously destroy many of the authors of their culture. They seem to have no other way to go except to be conquered or to follow the many evils of their enemies. However, China taught me one thing, and this is something that any Westerner who studies China with sensitive sympathy can obtain. China taught me to think from a longer time perspective, and not to despair because of the current bad environment. During the dark journey of the past twenty years, this habit helped me make this world more tolerable." He seemed to have learned the habit of enduring the status quo from the Chinese.</p>
<p>After returning to England from China, Russell had two children. Later, he became interested in education. Regarding education, his proposition is that it is important to find ways to make children happy, and there is no need to have overly strict restrictions. He is not completely in favor of laissez-faire. He believes that the use of force, in education as in politics, is sometimes necessary. The problem is only the degree of difference. However, if we can make children happy, the use of force can be reduced to a minimum.</p>
<p>In his later years, Russell also became interested in history. His view of history is different from Marx's. In terms of philosophy, Marx only recognized that philosophy is the result of social conditions, and did not recognize that philosophy is also the cause of social conditions. This is what Russell disagrees with. Russell believes that philosophy is the result and also the cause. Plato's philosophy is the result of Greek society and also the cause of medieval Christian theology. If only the former is recognized and not the latter, then the growth of the medieval church cannot be explained. His most recent "History of Western Philosophy" was written from this perspective.</p>
<p>Russell is still alive. Although he is nearly eighty years old, he has not stopped his writing. He is still a shining star in today's ideological circles.</p>
<h3>Random Notes on Academic Circles (6)</h3>
<p>— Zhang Qiyun</p>
<p>The Path to World Government</p>
<p>Recently, scholars, in view of the failure of the League of Nations in the past and the fear that the current United Nations' power is not enough to eliminate war, have advocated expanding the current American federal system to create a world government. In the future, the status of various countries in the world should be like the forty-eight states of the United States, and part of the current national sovereignty should be granted to the world government jointly supported by various countries. When this ideal will be realized cannot be foreseen, but there are already quite a few people who have written books to discuss it. The book "The Individual, the State, and World Government" (published by Macmillan, New York, 1947) by Dr. A.C. Ewing, a famous philosopher at Cambridge University in England, is an example. There are many problems in this, and in terms of the major ones, one is the problem of the world parliament. How should representatives be produced? If calculated by population, China and India account for almost half of the world's population. If based on wealth, industrial productivity, international trade, etc., it is also very difficult to find a generally accepted standard. The second is which of the sovereign rights of various countries should be restricted. Such as the abolition of tariffs, the unification of the international monetary system, the control of certain rare raw materials, and how to stipulate the rights and obligations of world citizens, there must be reasonable and concrete measures to achieve the purpose of establishing a world government. Dr. Ewing inherited the tradition of British utilitarianism and believes that the rights enjoyed by individuals should be measured by what is beneficial to the public. The sovereign rights enjoyed by the state should also be measured by what is beneficial to all mankind. Whether the veto power enjoyed by the major powers of the United Nations should be retained or abolished is a prerequisite for the establishment of a world government.</p>
<p>The first chapter of the United Nations Charter clearly states that the purpose of the United Nations is to maintain peace and security, adopt collective methods to prevent and eliminate threats to peace, and stop acts of aggression. However, the functions of the United Nations General Assembly are limited to discussion and recommendations, and it cannot take direct action. At most, the General Assembly can send an investigation team, such as the recent Palestine issue. As for safeguarding the territorial integrity of Greece, the General Assembly cannot take any action. The power of the United Nations is concentrated in the Security Council. On June 1, 1945, the United Nations General Assembly opened in San Francisco, and the Soviet Union first raised the issue of the veto, taking this as a condition for participating in the United Nations. If a country suffers from foreign aggression and appeals to the Security Council for justice, the Soviet Union believes that no resolution can be made without the unanimous agreement of the five permanent members. In the past two years, the Soviet Union has exercised its veto power in the Security Council as many as seventeen times. In addition, France has used it once, and the Soviet Union and France have used it jointly once. At present, the United Nations can be said to be dim, and many commentators attribute it to the deterioration of relations between the United States and the Soviet Union. What is the reason? According to H.F. Armstrong, editor of the American journal Foreign Affairs, one of the reasons is that the Soviet Union has established puppet governments outside its borders. In the view of Americans, this is not necessary, but from the perspective of the international situation since 1918, there may be some reasons. As for the Soviet Union's frequent use of the veto in the Security Council, it has made the United Nations a situation of no progress. Armstrong pointed out that the veto problem is the main reason for the deterioration of relations between the United States and the Soviet Union. To evolve from the United Nations to a world government, it is necessary to start by solving this problem. Of course, the road to Datong is not something that can be achieved overnight.</p>

<h3>Great Minds Think Alike</h3>
<p>— Tan Zhengbi</p>
<p>Lu Xun's "Qiejieting Essays, Second Collection," Draft 6, contains a passage about the problem of "selections." He said: "What the selection shows is often not the author's characteristics, but the selector's vision. The sharper the vision, the broader the knowledge, the more accurate the selection is, but unfortunately, most of the visions are like beans, obliterating the author's truth... Tao Qian, who was selected by the selectors for "Returning Home" and "Peach Blossom Spring," and praised by the critics for "picking chrysanthemums under the eastern fence, leisurely seeing the southern mountains," has really been floating in the minds of later generations for too long, but in the complete works,... In addition to the "leisurely seeing the southern mountains" admired by the critics, there are also "Jingwei carrying small wood, about to fill the sea, Xing Tian dancing with axes and shields, fierce ambition is always there" and other "completely angry eyes" style, proving that he is not floating all day and all night. This "fierce ambition is always there" and "leisurely seeing the southern mountains" is the same person. If there is selection and abandonment, it is not the whole person. If there is further suppression and elevation, it is even further from the truth?" This very alert discussion, when I read it at the time, I thought it was Lu Xun's own opinion, so I quoted it in my post-war revised "Outline of Chinese Literature History" and praised it as Lu Xun's unique vision.</p>
<p>Later, I accidentally read "Kun Xue Ji Wen" and learned that the Song people had already said this earlier, and in Lu Xun, it was just "great minds think alike" with the ancients, but in me, it became "forgetting one's ancestors." "Kun Xue Ji Wen" is a reading note that is biased towards textual research. The author is Wang Yinglin, a famous historian and geographer in the Southern Song Dynasty. Volume 18, on poetry, has a passage that says: "Tao Jingjie's "Reading the Classic of Mountains and Seas" is like Qu Yuan's "Distant Journey." "Jingwei carries small wood, about to fill the sea, Xing Tian dances with axes and shields, fierce ambition is always there." The depth of the sorrow can be tearful." This passage is exactly the same as what Lu Xun said. Weng Yuanqi's note also quotes Zhen Xishan's "Postscript to Huang Yingfu's Imitation of Tao Poetry" saying: "... Ming Dynasty... Wang Shi,... there is the heart of the Duke of Changsha, only because he cannot use his strength, so he... to cut himself off, the words of eating wild herbs and drinking water refer to the Tao Kan who... Ming Dynasty. He was a sky-supporting hero of the Jin Dynasty, who successively put down many domestic rebellions and served as the attendant Zhong Taiwei, military affairs, and was appointed as a general. It can be seen that he was a figure of the times. His story of... moving... is also talked about by... movers. Zhen Xishan's statement that... Ming had such a heroic ambition as Tao Kan is a shocking theory. Although he was a Neo-Confucianist, he was able to have such common sense... Ming, which is ten thousand times better than the pedantic scholars of Zhu Xi at the same time. And his statement is even one step further than Wang Yinglin and Lu Xun.</p>
<p>Therefore, I realized the main idea of my late teacher Zhu Xiangwan, who insisted on the principle of "narrating but not creating" throughout his life of teaching, thinking that what I saw, and I thought I had obtained it uniquely, had often been said by the ancients, so I would rather narrate than create. At that time, when I heard him say this in the classroom, I privately thought it was too pedantic. Now that I have such a thing, I know that heroes can all think alike, but it is not allowed to forget their ancestors, and "creation" is indeed not an easy task. The arguments made by a generation of scholars may not have been said by people of the previous generation. If it comes from the pen of an ordinary person, it will be slandered as plagiarism of old words. Then the same "great minds think alike" is still fortunate and unfortunate.</p>
<h3>Forgetting the Fundamentals</h3>
<p>— Wang Baili</p>
<p>I really dare not agree with the statement that calling people who "speak and act in accordance" gentlemen. The reason is: speaking and acting in accordance is originally everyone's duty. If a person's duty is praised with the name gentleman, then everyone is a gentleman. Such so-called gentlemen are not rare at all. Some people say that because everyone is a gentleman, they feel that gentlemen are not rare. Therefore, there are "smart" people who come up with new topics such as speaking against their actions or acting against their words to reform the inherent "bad habits." Sure enough, some people imitate them. As a result, the world is bustling and there are only people who speak and act in contradiction. Therefore, they think that people who stick to their duties are rare. Things are valued when they are rare, so they call people who speak and act in accordance gentlemen again. Although this statement is a bit humorous or satirical, it makes a lot of sense when you think about it carefully. This is roughly the same as the words "consistent quality" on current advertisements. Originally, "consistent quality" is the duty of the factory's products, a matter of course and not surprising. However, the so-called "consistent quality" here seems to indicate that the materials of the general factory's products were originally of the highest quality, but later, when their reputation rose slightly, they cut corners and changed to inferior goods. The advertisers did not know whether they were deliberately joking or what, and gave the general factories a "humorous" note, thinking that the gradual deterioration of the products was the factory's due process. Therefore, when advertising, they specially marked "consistent quality" to call each other, thinking that only this: the deterioration of the products seems to be a duty, while "consistent quality" is unique. Isn't that forgetting the fundamentals? In fact, "consistent quality" is not a rare thing among today's factories!</p>
<p>The above two things are similar to a passage in Yuan Can's biography in the "History of the Southern Dynasties, Book of Song." The biography briefly says: Can was clean and upright and had a demeanor. He once said to people: "There is a country, and there is a river in the country, called the Mad Spring. The people of the country who drink this water are all mad, but the king of the country digs a well and drinks it, and he is the only one who is not sick. The people of the country are all mad, and they think that the king is not mad is mad. So they gathered together to plot, arrested the king together, and treated his madness. Fire, moxibustion, needles, and stones were all prepared. The king could not bear the pain, so he went to the spring and drank the water. After drinking, he became mad. So the king, ministers, and the size of the country were all mad. Everyone was happy. Now that I am not mad, it is difficult to stand alone. I also want to drink this spring!" Hearing this, it is really laughable and lamentable. Lord Yuan thought that if a person drank "Mad Spring," he would definitely be mad. I heard that Guangzhou has a "Greedy Spring" (?). (See Fan Bonian's biography in the same book.) Drinking it will definitely make people greedy. Today, the wind of corruption is very strong in the country. Is it also caused by drinking this "Greedy Spring"! I can't help but feel emotional about it!</p>
<h3>Conflicting Accounts of Yue Fei's Death</h3>
<p>— Zheng Guoyi</p>
<p>The "History of the Song Dynasty" does not clearly state how Yue Ewang died in prison, only saying: "Qin Hui wrote a small note to the prison officer, who immediately reported: Fei is dead." The common people are familiar with the narration in "The Biography of Yue," all saying that Fei, his son Yun, and Zhang Xian were all hanged at Fengbo Pavilion. This is a baseless rumor. The Fengbo Pavilion incident is mentioned in "Zhu Jian Hu Ji," which says: "When Yue Wumu returned to the court and passed by Jinshan Temple, Zen Master Daoyue advised him not to go to the pass. Wumu did not listen. Daoyue left him a poem saying: The water under Fengbo Pavilion is滔滔, you must firmly grasp the rudder with a thousand hearts. I am afraid that the companions will have bad intentions and push you into the deep waves. Wumu arrived in Lin'an and was imprisoned in the Dali Prison. There was a pavilion with the inscription Fengbo. He then realized the meaning of the poem and regretted not listening to his words." The above is probably an attachment to the novel and may not be true, but there is no mention of being hanged.</p>
<p>I once collected records. There are different rumors about Fei's death. I will record them separately below, which is enough to provide assistance. "The Wild History of the Imperial Court" says: "Yue Fei's death in the bath was actually due to requesting to take a bath, pulling his ribs and suffocating him. The prison guard Kui Shun carried his body out and buried it in the back of Beishan." This says that he died in the bath by pulling his ribs. "Lin Quan Ye Ji" says: "Qin Hui satirized the officials to say that Fei did not aid Huaixi, and he was dismissed as the Shao Bao Wusheng Ding Guo Jun Jiedushi Liquan Guan Shi. Soon after, the commander Zhang Xian plotted a rebellion, hoping that the court would return Fei, and he would be the deputy commander. Wang Jun discovered his treachery, and Zhang Jun also said it. Hui then said that Fei ordered his son Yun to write a letter to Xian, and Fei was sent to the Dali Temple. The Imperial Censor Zhong Wan Qiyu was ordered to interrogate him, and he blamed Yun and Xian, who were sentenced to death, and Fei was given death." This means that Fei was actually given death, and although Fei was innocent, Zhang Xian had a trace of plotting a rebellion. "Sanchao Beimeng Huibian" says: "On the day of Guiyi, Fei died in prison. His head was displayed as a warning. The people in the market heard of it and were sad and shed tears." Although this does not clearly state how he died, it is said that his head was displayed as a warning, which means that Fei suffered the tragic death of being beheaded after his death. "The Biography of Yuehou" says: "On the twenty-seventh day of the twelfth month of the tenth year of Shaoxing, Hou died of poisoning and was buried in a vegetable garden in Lin'an. All those who heard of it in the world shed tears, and even three-foot-tall children all complained about Qin Hui." This also says that Fei died of poisoning. In summary, the descriptions of Fei's death are not the same. It is said that people at the time also knew the truth about Fei's death. (All the above-mentioned books were written by Song people.) The "History of the Song Dynasty" does not clearly state how Fei died, probably because it is difficult to follow. I think that the saying of being given death may be credible, because Gaozong's desire to kill Fei had accumulated for more than a day, so there was no need to avoid it and let Qin Hui bear the blame alone. Since "The Biography of Yue" came out, another saying of being hanged was added, and no one knew about the various rumors of "pulling ribs," "being given death," "being beheaded," and "dying of poisoning." The power of the rumors in the alleyways is so great that it is not surprising!</p>
<h3>Inside a Coffee Shop</h3>
<p>— Mao Yi</p>
<p>I recently sat in a small coffee shop in New York when a beautiful girl came in. The head waiter saw her and placed her at the table next to mine. I sized up this newcomer. She was wearing the kind of clothes that every wife likes to wear.</p>
<p>Across the tofu-sized dance floor, I noticed a neat gentleman sharing my concern for the girl. When she looked his way, he smiled at her. The "unclaimed" lady smiled back at him. The gentleman stood up and walked out to the cashier. After a moment, he returned with a bouquet of orchids wrapped in cellophane. The hypocrite wrote something on the back of a menu and then had a waiter send the menu and orchids to the lady. After she read the words on the back of the menu, she sent back a promising smile to the sender. Then, the gentleman walked over to her table, bowed deeply, introduced himself, and sat down.</p>
<p>I heard him say to her, "It's not much fun eating alone. Would you allow me to order some wine?"</p>
<p>I saw the head waiter serving the couple, waited a while, and then walked away.</p>
<p>"I've seen you in town many times," the man continued.</p>
<p>The woman smiled.</p>
<p>The waiter brought the wine and pulled the cork. "Made in 1926," the man said.</p>
<p>The band started playing, and the gentleman stood up, bowed deeply again, and asked if his female companion would like to dance. I admit they were a good couple on the dance floor. As I went out, I passed the head waiter. "What's going on here?" I said to him, "You saw what just happened!"</p>
<p>He smiled. "This has been going on for a long time," he said. "That gentleman is Mr. Coddington. For the past eleven years, on this evening in October, he and that lady have come to this coffee shop and repeated the same scene. Ever since he first saw her here in 1936, they have been doing this. They always book the same table. Once, I asked him what the reason was. He told me that it kept them both young."</p>
<p>"Who is that lady?" I asked.</p>
<p>The head waiter grinned. "She's Mrs. Coddington."</p>
<h3>Between Master and Servant</h3>
<p>— Chen Xiang</p>
<p>Recently, the American photojournalist John Florea, who returned from Japan, told a story about his servant.</p>
<p>In typical Oriental customs, a servant is unwilling to disturb his master's peace in any way. Once, Florea instructed his servant before resting to wake him up at exactly seven o'clock the next morning because he had an important appointment.</p>
<p>The next morning, the servant tiptoed in quietly, carefully placed a note on the side of the bed, and then quietly retreated. When Florea woke up, it was already close to noon. He saw the note, picked it up and read: "Mr. Florea, it is now seven o'clock. Wake up."</p>
<h3>Quibbling</h3>
<p>— Ji Mo</p>
<p>I have never liked to quibble with others in my life. When I withdraw cash from the bank, no matter how much it is, hundreds of millions of dollars, or as little as tens of millions of dollars, I have never counted them one by one. I put them in my pocket in stacks. Naturally, there are inevitable cases of missing money, but because the amount is small, I just let it go.</p>
<p>However, as I got deeper into the world, I suffered a lot from not being willing to quibble when I came into contact with people in the business world. Assuming that you run back and forth for a certain person to get a batch of goods, which takes a lot of effort. After the matter is completed, maybe someone will invite you to a meal. It is just a casual meal in a very ordinary restaurant. If you are shy and say, "I am not willing to work for you for free, so there is no need for remuneration." The other party may actually say, "In that case, thank you very much, let's be friends." When you think back to the labor of running around during the initial treatment, you suddenly feel like crying and laughing.</p>
<p>There is a friend of mine who has the same temper as me. This gentleman also loves to have an indissoluble bond with ink. Once, when he was the editor-in-chief of a supplement for a friend, he had to write it himself when there was a shortage of manuscripts. He had to write more than ten articles a month, about 20,000 to 30,000 words. After two months, he thought that after the end of the term as deputy editor, his friend would definitely have a considerable remuneration. Who knew that his friend would use the excuse that the newspaper's expenses were insufficient. As a result, this gentleman did not receive a single cent. In fact, nine out of ten literati are calm. As long as you give a little remuneration, they will never quibble, but often even the lowest remuneration cannot be obtained, which inevitably makes professional writers sigh at the "inkstone."</p>
<p>I still remember that at the beginning of this year, this column published an article congratulating on making a fortune, which analyzed in detail Confucius's psychology of rarely mentioning profit but perhaps hoping to make a fortune. However, this article did not mention a word about how to make a fortune. This draft can add a transition to this article. Quibbling may be a way to make a fortune.</p>
<h3>Domestic Affairs and Managing a Household</h3>
<p>— Jin Jin</p>
<p>In general, Chinese scholars and officials have a traditional perspective on managing household affairs, considering that governing a household is comparable to "regulating the state" and "bringing peace to the world." Being fair in cutting meat might even be a prerequisite for one day becoming a prime minister. Therefore, those responsible for managing household affairs, even if they don't understand those lofty principles, should at least have read through Zhu Xi's Family Instructions once, since this article is very easy to find. If you really can't find it, buying an ingot of Zhu Xi's Family Instructions ink will also satisfy your desire to thoroughly study it.</p>
<p>However, in doing so, one inevitably becomes more and more distant from genuine household matters. For example, how to cook meat to make it delicious and palatable, or how to utilize empty milk powder or coffee cans, seem to be overlooked when focusing on those grand principles. Therefore, recently, the author, while reading a column called "Housewives' Notebook" in an American Western family magazine, felt that this topic was not easily translated into Chinese. If translated as "Main Housewives' Notes," it seems that such a thing simply doesn't exist in Chinese families. Conversely, if translated as "Household Management Records," it seems too serious. This is because the content of the column is nothing more than recording things like "when a brown or black table has white scratches, you can apply the same color shoe polish."</p>
<p>I often feel that household affairs cannot escape those trivial daily matters. If one truly wants to always associate them with those lofty and impractical principles, perhaps the "household" will not be "managed" well, and household affairs will instead be thrown into a mess.</p>
<h3>Two Gu Tinglins</h3>
<p>— Yu Jianhua</p>
<p>In the late Ming Dynasty, there were two prominent Tinglins, one earlier and one later. The earlier one was a painter, and the later one was a scholar. Now, brief biographies of these two individuals are recorded below:</p>
<p>Gu Zhengyi, a native of Huating in the Ming Dynasty, courtesy name Zhongfang, sobriquet Tinglin, served as a scribe in the Imperial Secretariat during the Wanli era. He was skilled in landscape painting, following the style of Da Chi (Huang Gongwang). His family possessed many famous works, and he was also friends with Song Xu of Jiaxing and Sun Kehong of the same county. He thoroughly explored the essence of their art, and thus became a master in his own right. His mountains often featured square peaks and layered, stacked ranges, with sparse trees, naturally elegant and beautiful, thus forming the Huating school. — See Wang Zhideng's "Biography of Gu Tinglin," the "Art and Literature Monographs of the History of the Ming Dynasty," the "Suzhou Prefecture Gazetteer," the "Songjiang Gazetteer," the "Ming Painting Records," the "Silent Poetry History," the "Painting History Essentials," the "Continued Compilation of the Precious Mirror of Painting," the "Collection of Mo Tinghan," the "Collection of Ronghe," the "Compilation of Painting History," the "Biographical Dictionary of Painting Dedications," the "Biographical Dictionary of Chinese Names," and other books.</p>
<p>Gu Yanwu, a native of Kunshan in the early Qing Dynasty, was born during the Wanli era of the Ming Dynasty, initially named Jiang, courtesy name Ningren, sobriquet Tinglin. He was upright and unconventional, and together with his fellow villager Gui Zhuang, was known for his eccentricities. During the reign of Prince Lu, he and Zhuang raised troops to support the Ming Dynasty, serving as a staff officer in the Ministry of War. After the defeat, he escaped and changed his name to Yanwu after the Qing Dynasty was established. He repeatedly declined official positions, traveled throughout the country, cherishing the former dynasty. He visited the Ming tombs several times and later died in Huayin. Yanwu's scholarship followed the teachings of Cheng and Zhu, devoted to the Six Classics, extensively studying national institutions, local customs, as well as astronomy, instruments, military affairs, agriculture, river transport, and other subjects, focusing on gathering substance and seeking practicality, investigating the origins and details. In his later years, he meticulously studied ancient texts, also with a fondness for epigraphy. He authored dozens of works such as "Record of Daily Knowledge" and "Book of Advantages and Disadvantages of the Empire." — See "Ciyuan," "Cihai," and "Biographical Dictionary of Chinese Names," and other books.</p>
<p>From this, it can be seen that Gu Yanwu was indeed a scholar of great renown, but Gu Zhengyi was also not an insignificant figure. Moreover, he was a painter admired by Dong Qichang. Few people in the Ming Dynasty studied Huang Gongwang, but Zhengyi specialized in studying Huang. Therefore, Dong Qichang also studied Huang, and the subsequent worship of Huang by the Four Wangs and Wu Yun shaped the painting style of the Qing Dynasty, which can all be said to have originated from Zhengyi. Those who study painting history should not ignore this figure. However, because of the shared sobriquet "Tinglin" and the relatively close time periods of the two Tinglins, confusion is inevitable, and some people have made jokes as a result.</p>
<p>The first example is Mr. Ye Dehui of the late Qing Dynasty, who authored books such as "Records of Paintings and Calligraphy from the Yuyuan Studio," a poem entitled "Dispelling Summer Heat," and "One Hundred Poems on Painting Appreciation." Lu Lianfu, in his preface to Ye's "One Hundred Poems on Painting Appreciation," praised him, saying that his "spirit is discerning, his collection is rich, and books and paintings are his hobbies. He has seen all the famous calligraphic works and paintings collected in the inner palace, and knows the origins of the Six Canons since the Jin Dynasty, as well as the division and merging of the Northern and Southern Schools from the Yuan and Ming dynasties to the present." Now, looking at his "One Hundred Poems on Painting Appreciation," spanning thousands of years, his vision is high, his insights are outstanding, his memory is rich, and his horizon is broad, truly as Lianfu claimed. However, in the note for the ninety-ninth poem, he wrote, "Gu Tinglin Jiang imitated a small scene by Yunlin, believing that 'ancient literary inspiration arrives and creates, sufficient to be famous in the world.'" I think this painting must be by Gu Zhengyi, whose sobriquet was Tinglin, and not Gu Jiang, whose sobriquet was also Tinglin.</p>
<p>The second example is the modern elder Yu Shaosong of Longyou. He authored books such as "Essential Records of Painting Methods," Volumes 1 and 2, and "Annotated Bibliography of Books on Calligraphy and Painting," whose scope of collection, richness of reading, sharpness of vision, and appropriateness of evaluation can be said to be unparalleled throughout the ages, benefiting later scholars and contributing to the art of painting in no small measure. However, he also inevitably misunderstood Gu Tinglin. In his "Annotated Bibliography of Calligraphy and Painting, under 'Zhu Wo'an's Book Collection,'" he wrote:</p>
<p>"...Furthermore, there is a painting by Gu Tinglin imitating Huang Gongwang's landscape. Gu's painting is already questionable, and the note below says: 'Colophon by Chen Meigong.' Examining the facts, Meigong died in the twelfth year of Chongzhen, at the age of ninety. Tinglin was born in the forty-first year of Wanli. When Meigong died, Tinglin was only twenty years old, and it would not have been possible for him to write a colophon for his painting. Citing this one point, we know that this compilation cannot be deeply trusted. We will list it here for further examination." This clearly treats Gu Yanwu as Gu Zhengyi. Zhengyi studied Huang Gongwang, so why is it questionable? Meigong died in the twelfth year of Chongzhen, so it seems impossible for him to write a colophon for a painting by Gu Tinglin, the scholar born during the Wanli era. However, what is impossible about him writing a colophon for a painting by Gu Tinglin, who served as a scribe in the Imperial Secretariat during the Wanli era?</p>
<p>It is understandable if ordinary people make mistakes, but Mr. Ye and Mr. Yu are experts who have read numerous ancient and modern paintings and have read all the painting histories in the world. Yet, they inevitably had this oversight. It can truly be said to be a lapse of judgment even for the wise, and it further shows that the path of learning is endless, and one cannot be careless in the slightest.</p>
<p>Therefore, I am reminded that there are many people with the same name as mine. There are both men and women named Jianhua. As far as I know, there are at least ten or more. There are also three named Yu Jianhua. One is me, and one is from Taicang. He is a few years older than me and is a strong member of the Southern Society and a famous poet and lyricist. I visited him in Taicang in 1928 and 1930. We even took a photo together. He cannot paint, but I cannot write poetry either. Another one is said to be a student at the Shanghai Business School. Although there are already three with the same name (in reality, there must be more than that), this is far fewer than the fifteen Wu Guozhens.</p>
<h3>Carefree Flower</h3>
<p>— Chen Shenyan</p>
<p>Chapter 8　Failure is Imminent (47)</p>
<p>Fengsheng wiped her tears and said, "Since he doesn't want me anymore, why should I force him to want me? That's too undignified." Yunqing said, "If you leave in a fit of anger like this, it will only suit his wishes. You can't make it so easy for him." Fengsheng said, "He doesn't want me anymore, what can I do?" Yunqing said, "You can propose conditions, demand money from him! At this critical moment, you must strike first, don't wait for him to set things up before launching his attack. Losing one move puts you at a disadvantage everywhere. In short, men's hearts are ruthless, we must harden our hearts and fight him." Fengsheng said, "How should I fight? My family has never done such a thing." Yunqing said, "Zhu Zhai's intentions are irreparable, you can temporarily compromise and endure, but it will eventually erupt." Fengsheng said, "I see this very clearly. I noticed something was off about his attitude towards me just a few days after we got married. I've been worried about this day and night." As she spoke, she burst into tears again. Yunqing said, "I think it's better for you to strike first than to let him initiate it. We should propose a few conditions, secure our position first, and then watch how he unfolds his plans." Fengsheng said, "What conditions should I propose?" Yunqing said, "Consider what is beneficial to you and propose that." Fengsheng hesitated for a moment and said, "I think in this era, money is paramount. I'll tell him to give me half of all his assets." Yunqing said, "That first condition is a failure. You must know that Zhu Zhai's family does have assets, but his assets are all in his father's hands. He has no control over them. If you propose that condition, he won't be able to fulfill it. You must propose conditions that he can fulfill, so that he can comply!" Fengsheng leaned back and thought for a moment and said, "If he can't give me his assets, what other conditions would be beneficial to me? Help me think, my brain is too slow right now." Yunqing said, "We must strike first, first secure our position. With a firm foothold, we won't suffer losses. First: of course, focus on money, but don't demand his assets, only demand living expenses to support you for the rest of your life. This kind of living expenses, you can voluntarily cancel, but he can never cancel. Second: demand security. The so-called security is that the house you currently live in, as well as all the objects, all belong to you, to be freely disposed of by you, and Zhu Zhai cannot interfere in any way. Third: demand freedom. The so-called freedom is that the divorce agreement signed by both parties does not need to be publicized. You have complete freedom, you can cancel it, he cannot cancel it, leaving room for retreat. In other words, if you have a suitable partner in the future, you can freely marry him. If you don't have a satisfactory partner, Zhu Zhai's responsibility for your living expenses will never end. I think we should negotiate with Zhu Zhai based on these conditions, and see how he responds."

<h3>Reply from the Traffic Department of the Beijing-Shanghai Railway Administration to "A Passenger on the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway"</h3>
<p>Regarding your letter forwarded by the "Social Services" column of the Shen Bao, we hereby respond separately as follows:</p>
<p>Upon investigation, the current passenger situation on this railway is more than one and a half times higher than before the war, requiring 622 passenger cars to cope. Currently, only 447 passenger cars are available for passengers. If tickets are sold according to the number of seats, it is feared that those who have difficulty purchasing tickets will turn to the black market, so it is unavoidable to sell tickets exceeding the number of seats, but there is a certain limit. To solve this problem, we are now trying to build new passenger cars, purchase old cars, and rent vehicles amid economic difficulties, in order to improve the crowded situation.</p>
<p>Passengers riding in higher-class carriages than their tickets allow should pay the difference, according to regulations.</p>
<p>"Military Priority Cars" are specifically for military personnel to ride in, so as to avoid mixing with ordinary passengers. Since its implementation, both ordinary passengers and military personnel have found it convenient, and order has been greatly improved. To avoid misunderstandings by military personnel boarding mid-way, a small number of seats may be reserved for military personnel in each military priority car, but these priority cars are also very crowded.</p>
<p>If passengers are crowded and cannot board the train, they can ask the stationmaster to sign approval for them to take the next equivalent train on the same day, according to regulations.</p>
<h3>Postal Service Q&amp;A</h3>
<p>This Bureau has received inquiries from Mr. Li Xingyan of Linhai, Mr. Wang Yizu of Fudan University in Jiangwan, and Mr. Wu Guangyu of Yiwu. We hereby briefly answer the various points raised as follows:</p>
<p>Answer: (A) The handling of drafts from the United States to China was resumed on December 1st of last year. The handling of drafts from China to the United States has not yet been started. (B) Radio parts can be sent as parcels. However, after arriving at the destination, a bill of lading must be obtained from the local telecommunications bureau for import approval, and submitted to the customs for approval before they can be collected. As for how customs will levy taxes, please inquire directly with the customs.</p>
<p>(A) Since the interruption of the Longhai Railway, the Bureau has temporarily suspended the acceptance of printed matter destined for Shaanxi due to difficulties in transshipment. Airmail delivery has also been temporarily suspended due to the limited tonnage of aircraft. The postage calculation method is as follows: printed matter is 1,000 yuan for the first 100 grams, and 500 yuan for each additional 100 grams; airmail is charged an additional 2,000 yuan for every 20 grams. Each item is limited to 2 kilograms. (B) The acceptance of both airmail and ordinary parcels destined for Shaanxi is currently temporarily suspended.</p>
<p>(A) Agencies should deliver both ordinary and registered letters. However, sometimes registered letters are left with a notification for the recipient to pick up from the relevant agency if the recipient is not present or there is no chop. (B) If an agency is found to be privately opening other people's letters, it can be reported to the Bureau. (C) If there is no concrete evidence for the aforementioned report, the Bureau will also find a way to thoroughly investigate. (D) Postal personnel may not open other people's mail, but this does not apply to newspapers, periodicals, printed matter, trade agreements, business flyers, and samples, etc., which are required to be opened for inspection in accordance with laws and regulations. (E) The name of the person reporting can be kept confidential. Investigators have a strict obligation to maintain this confidentiality.</p>
<h3>Regarding Academic Qualifications　Review Questions　Reply to Readers</h3>
<p>We recently received a reply from the Shanghai Education Bureau: "Regarding the review, according to the Ministry of Education's order, graduates of false schools or unregistered private secondary schools in war zones who did not participate in the previous review due to disturbances, may apply for a supplementary review at any time if they have solid proof." Please pay attention and don't miss the opportunity again.</p>
<p>Book Wanted: The Taiwan Provincial Agricultural Experiment Station Library is seeking a copy of "A Unified Classification System for Chinese and Foreign Books" by Wang Yunwu. Those willing to part with it are asked to indicate the price of the book and contact the library in Taipei, Taiwan.</p>
