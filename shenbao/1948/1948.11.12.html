<h3>國父誕辰感言</h3>
<p>今天是國父誕辰紀念日，際此天高氣爽的佳令，欣逢中華民國國父的誕辰，本應興高彩烈，大家來替國父及國家熱烈慶祝一番，但北望碧雲寺，南看紫金山，半個中國爲戰亂的烽火所龍罩，充滿了一片殺伐之聲，而大多數的人民，又都在饑餓綫上掙扎，雖欲謁陵追懷而不可能。國事蜩螗，四海鼎沸，國父致力革命四十年所憧憬的理想－三民主義的新中國，如果欲求其實現，正不知需要我們後死的國民，尤其是國民黨的黨員們，今後更作如何的努力·如就今天而言，我們對於國父在天之靈，只有深戚愧疚！</p>
<p>我們緬懷國父誕生八十二年以來的中國歷史，正視目前國內所潛伏的各種危機，再展望我國革命建國的前程，眞是威喟萬千，不知從何說起。但一轉念及國父的一生，又給我們百倍勇氣，只要找們能像國父那樣的純誠，那樣的奮鬥，大家奉行國父的主義，則革命建國何患不成？又何患國家不能富强康樂？目前第一緊要，全國上下必須深刻反省，痛切自責，澈底發憤，而不可有絲毫頹慶！</p>
<p>國父的一生，燃燒着愛國救世的熱情，確信革命建國的三民主義，以其至大至剛的精神，領導國民革命，四十年如一日，不怕艱險，不避危難，不屈不撓，艱苦奮〔，直到臨終的最後一剎那，猶不忘「和平，奮鬥，救中國」的大事。我們旣有這樣偉大領袖，領導我們革命建國，只要從他逝世的一矢起，就能遵奉國父的遺訓：「革命尙未成功，同志仍須努力」：「和平，奮鬥，救中國」，則我們絕對可以相信，國事决不致搞到今天不可收拾的局勢，而回想廿多年來的經過，不論是國民黨的黨員，或是奉行國父遺敎的國民，對於革命建國的大業，不是熱賊不够，就是陽奉陰違，甚至有的在革命的名義之下墮落了，腐化了，反而變成了革命建國的礙障。我們撫今思昔，實不勝威慨系之。</p>
<p>往者不諫，來者可追，過去有負國父之處甚多，我們也不必去追咎旣往了。但自今而後，務期革面洗心，庶不有負國父，也不負三民主義。目前的局勢，雖然危急，但無論如何，並非不可挽救。我們認爲，爲今之計，唯有遵奉國父遺敎，澈底革命，努力建國，政府則事事以人民爲重，處處爲人民打算，不再趾高氣揚，閉門造車，老是以爲「民可使由之，不可使知之，」或甚至做幾件與人民好惡相反的事情。而人民則亦眞誠與政府合作，共同努力。只要上下打成一片，下大決心，任何危難終可克服，革命建國不會不成功的·而且我們唯有從國父遺訓中，可以發掘出國家走上復興的大道·國父的革命理論，是民族的，而不是階級的，可謂救亡的不二法則。抗戰八年所以能轉敗爲勝，就是靠了國父的民族主義，使全國人民不分南北，不論男女，都能犧牲一切，以爭民族的自由·現在戰亂遍及全國，其性質乃是民族主義與共產主義之戰爭，只要政府能瞭然於國父超越階級的革命理論，特別注重平民，謀得民生的安定，則一切亂源都可以消弭於無形；同時，只要人民能知共產主義挾其國際侵略背景而來，則自然能共同激發同仇敵愾的民族精神，以撲滅此叛國的兇燄！我們要挽回大局，扭轉乾坤，方足以對得起國父在天之靈！</p>
<h3>美國經濟合作總署　加緊運糧食來華　港府宣佈運米萬噸來滬</h3>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓十日電〕政府當局十日宣稱：經濟合作總署正加緊以糧食運往中國。目前中國糧荒並非該署未能如期接濟，實係由於中國政府未能遵照數月前與該署所成立之協定供給十月份，十一月份及十二月份糧食之故。該三月中中國新穀登塲時期，該署預定在此期間不運出糧食，現以情勢緊急，該署正自美國西北部趕運麵粉及小麥至中國繼續配給。該批糧食原擬明年初運出，現已提前裝運，可望於十一月下旬起陸續運到中國。該署並再撥三，八〇一，〇〇〇元，續購緬甸米，運往華南華中配給·麵粉小麥則運往靑島，天津與華北其他不食米區域。緬甸米何日運到，須視緬甸航運情形而定。據非正式估計，經濟合作總署之經濟援華部份現已撥出一億五千萬元，其中小麥一千萬元，石油二千二百萬元，以上均已運到，此外尙有麵粉五百萬元，米二千七百萬元，棉花七千萬元，肥田粉七百萬元。</p>

<h3>華北剿總文敎會主委　泰巨咱演講富政治意義　華北大局樂觀</h3>
<p>〔本報北平十一日電〕東北戰事失利後，華北官方盛傳傳總司令將發表重要時局文吿，安定人心。惟該項文吿迄未發出，而華北剿總文敎委會主委秦巨川，昨日對全市中小學敎員忽作極富政治意義之演講，一般咸信此講演或卽傅氏文吿之化身。秦氏於演講中曾透露：（一）中央已將華北全權交與傳總司令，總統離平前三小時，曾吿傳氏，如華北剿總的措施與中央法令有牴觸時，以傅氏的意見爲基準，傳總司令今後已可放手作去，（二）東北未失前，美國官員曾主張直接援助華北，傳因保持國家統一，尊重中央權力，皆予拒絕。繼稱：傅總司令南京歸來後，對時局極爲樂觀，說：「東北失利，華北局勢嚴重，必須全力挽回；東北失利，華北壓力增大，並不是根本生存上發生了動搖，而是生機轉換的轉機，因爲：１因東北之失將使美輕歐；２因東北失利將是戰略改變，並加强總體戰的最好時機；３今後華北由傳統一指揮，對華北有利；４現在東北失守，那些腐蝕性的力量和沒有堅定信心的人都走了，對華北正是减輕了沉重的負擔。</p>

<h3>馬歇爾將返國晤杜魯門　統盤檢討世界大局　蘇聯倘無和平誠意表顯　杜魯門史達林會晤難期</h3>
<p>〔聯合社巴黎十日電〕聯大美國代表團今夜稱，國務卿馬歇爾將於本月下旬遄反華盛頓，與杜魯門總統全盤檢討世界大局，美蘇直接談判之可能性，亦在其列，莫斯科及羅馬方面傳出史達林可能與杜魯門會晤之消息，聯大方面聞之甚爲興奮，惟馬歇爾不置可否。</p>
<p>〔聯合社弗羅里達州凱威斯特十日電）杜魯門總統秘書艾爾斯宣稱，杜魯門史達林會晤事，並無任何部署。渠重申總統前所發表之聲明，謂史達林倘願來美，當隨時樂與會晤</p>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓十一日電〕此間外交方面認爲蘇聯對「杜魯門史達林和平會議」之關切，係蘇聯破壞西方國家團結之另一企圖。高級外交當局表示，渠等相信克林姆宮將利用杜史會議，以達到單純之宣傳價値。渠等預測，蘇聯決不會錯過時機，渠必利用此一兩强會議，以削弱美國與西歐非共產國家間之合作。據渠等判斷，杜史會談將給予蘇聯進一步破壞馬歇爾計劃及正在進行中之北大西洋聯盟之武器。按「華盛頓時事論壇報」八日關于杜史會議可能在醞釀中之報道，經塔斯社加以轉錄，十日莫斯科各報均以顯著地位刊出，一般認爲此卽表示蘇聯對此並不拒絕。但國務院之意見，則認爲此項會議可能無益，甚且有害，此事必須待至美國建立軍事實力之後，始能使蘇聯瞭解美國外交政策係「賓事求是」者。外交家更認爲，如蘇聯的確有意和平，則渠在柏林·在聯合國·在其他各地，均有與西方表示親睦之充份機會，美官員認爲，杜史在最近將來之會議，不致實現，其理由爲：（一）蘇聯早已顯示除「紙上協定」外，渠絕無達成任何協議之誠意·（二）史達林與杜魯門晤談後，可能以更多之「和平宣傳」，次要之讓步及表面之合作，推翻美國整備計劃，此將給予蘇聯加緊控制衛星國及在其他國家內建立第五縱隊之更多時間。（三）如杜史會議不能達成協議，則勢將加速兩國間之攤牌。</p>
<h3>蔣廷黻在政委會發言　反對蘇裁軍建議　要求解除第五縱隊武裝</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕巴黎十一日廣播：中國代表蔣廷黻在聯大政委會中稱，共黨利用日本戰俘五萬人對政府作戰。論及蘇聯主張將五强武力减三分之一之建議時，蔣氏聲明中國當建議聯合國採取行動，解除全世界第五縱隊之武裝。蔣氏謂蘇聯捕獲之日本戰俘，被東北共軍利用充作砲兵，飛機師，及坦克車兵士，此外尙有三萬日人在東北爲共軍服務。蔣氏說明政府對共軍之迅速推進，異常關切，蘇聯之建議在目前狀態下，中國絕難接受。</p>
<h3>蘇聯支持以色列　反對彭契計劃　安理會考慮執行停戰令</h3>
<p>〔合衆社巴黎十日電〕聯合國代理調解負彭契十日建議聯合國試行採取步驟，將巴勒斯坦南部之尼基夫區大部份劃爲非軍事地，按該區現在以色列軍隊手中。此一行動將需要以色列軍隊自最近從埃軍手中奪得之陣地，作大規模撤退。彭契之建議已提交安理會之七人委員會，以考慮實施安理會命令之方法。該委會可能研究若猶太拒絕自尼基夫區撤退時之强制實施方法。猶太方面業已暗示彼等將拒絕此一命令。安理會亦曾於十日討論巴勒曰斯坦問題及聽取蘇代表馬立克要求早日成立阿猶和平會議。馬立克籲請安理會命令阿猶雙方直接談判，經由彭契「成立正式和平」。契或蘇代表之要求乃暗示渠拒絕彭於九日提出之建議，認此建議僅係一停戰性者，並非是全面和平之計劃。蘇聯立塲似甚爲猶太方面贊成，但與英法觀點不合，可能與美國觀點亦不同。</p>

<p>銀根緊·現鈔缺　退票之多空前未有　行莊限制客戶提現　　昨日銀根仍緊，現鈔缺乏愈甚。非但商業銀行感受威脅。卽國家行局，亦感周轉爲難。外埠分支行局調措頭寸，尤感不便。負責方面稱，現鈔缺乏原因：一爲物價上漲，再爲商人携現赴外埠購貨，尤重要者，爲發行額二十億最高額所限。連日銀根太緊，頗多工商企業周轉困難。退票之多，空前未有，以致拆款常生糾紛，擁有現款者，對拆出對象，非常謹愼。　　本市金融市塲，近來發生空前之嚴重現象，一爲現鈔缺乏，一爲銀根奇緊。因現鈔缺乏，每千元貼水竟達二百元之鉅，因銀根奇緊，貨幫日拆每千創一百七十元之高峯，一百元之日拆，已極普通。中央銀行對於同業存款支付，決盡量予以便利，並未有硬性之規定，親頭寸之多寡，而決定支付標準。國家行局提用存款，十日起已略有限制，每家暫定六十萬元。商業行莊暫爲二十萬元，國家行局及商業行莊對一般客戶，每戶則限制提現三百元。在此種情形下，當然感覺應付困難。國家行局及商業行莊，已開始簽發本票。因此票據激增，商業行莊已實行緊縮，除停止放款外，並拒絕透支，以防發生意外。據銀行公會負責人吿記者，此次現鈔缺銀根緊之現象，係由物價暴漲，通貨流通速率增加所迭成。目前物價限價之開放，多已高漲十倍以上，現雖被迫猛跌，希望政府能把握時機，設法使其穩定。如無特殊因素刺激，物價穩定不成問題。內匯率調整　　中央銀行匯往各地匯款暫定匯率，自明日（十三）起變更，計長沙·衡陽·沅陵·漢口·重慶·成都·萬縣·自流井·徐州·平津·靑島·南昌·吉安·蕪湖·昆明·寳鷄·天水·雅安·康定·貴陽等地，均改爲每千元收二十元，寗彼每千元十元，其他各地則不動。國營事業股票票額即將調整　　〔本報訊〕國營事業股票停止出售後，有關當局對所有發行股票之事業，均將重行估價，票面額亦將調整，然後再行繼續發售。據悉停售之原因，主要爲百物俱貴，而國營事業股票獨賤，尤以台糖之股票，因台幣對金圓劵匯率之調整，無形中已跌價三倍，票額如不提高，亦將引起搶購風潮。棉紗交易稀少　　紗市仍因銀根緊迫，各方納胃薄弱，市勢平疲，嗣以今（十二）日國父誕辰紀念休業，成交者須軋當日頭寸，故至收時，行情微俏。做開四十二支藍鳳先喊八千五百元，中間紛起軋現，交易稀少，一度下挫至七千八百元，旋跟布市回好至八千元結束，比上日又小五百元。廿一支雙馬收價五千元，卅二支銀月六千五百元，廿支金城四千八百元，十六支光明四千八百元，十支童子軍三千五百元，（均爲當日交割），全日市氣呈先疲後穩之局。套利行市如下：四十二支藍鳳一千五百元，廿一支雙馬一千元，二十支金城一千元，均一天期。　　又訊：十日紡建公司棉紗之核配價，二十支天官五千元，八支日光三千元，十支立馬三千三百元，四十支日光七千元，四十支紅寳光七千元。棉布門市恢復營業　　棉布初市以銀根仍緊，門莊布號爲求現計，恢復營業，但市民之購買力已呈薄弱。塲外喊價，十二磅龍頭細布二百四五十元，天津帮及檯面帮競進，行情冉冉上升，至十一時許，一度高至三百元左右有成交，關因乘高吐售，近午回低至二百七十元，較上日軋升二十元，四君子嗶嘰，因紡建公司有配售，交易轉淸，行情與龍頭細布軋平。　　〔本報訊〕中國紡建公司昨循例報價核售棉布，共開各式棉布六種，美墨布三種。開價計四君子原直貢二八五元，跳鯉灰元斜一六〇元，跳鯉精元直買　三〇〇元，副牌廿九碼半嗶嘰坯及五　B十二磅細布均二〇〇元，龍頭十二磅細布一九五元。結果共售四四〇〇疋，准購單共一四三張，內廠商八張，購布八八〇疋，布號一三五張，購布三五二〇疋，共計價款五三六〇〇〇元。　　又該公司昨日同時報價核售呢絨四種，惟因報價過低，結果並未開出。紗布市場恢復　　今日起更換會員出入證　　本市棉紗棉布市塲，限價期間，奉令停止營業。限價開放後，一切物品均自由買賣，該紗布兩市塲卽呈請社會局准予恢復自由交易。昨經記者獲悉，社會局已准予該兩市塲自由集市交易·今明兩日該兩市塲在辦理更換全體會員之出入證，明日可全部辦妥。棉紗市塲定下週一起，恢復市塲交易。棉布市塲亦將於下週一二起，恢復市塲交易云。米市恢復正常　白粳以七百元成交　　昨日食米交易，市塲尙見做開，走勢已恢復正常，計開二十五石，價白粳七百元，早稻六百元，白元七百元，糙粳六五〇元，價與上日一致軋平。市塲到貨仍稀，南市登記到貨六百三十五石，北市塲因無米源，故交易停頓，市呈到銷兩稀局面。昨日食米塲外交易，亦見逕瀉。　　又訊：吳市長爲疏通米源，安定民生計，特飭令米業行家及經售商，於太月十四日起，每一單位每日須採購食米二十担，以供本市民食，若有違背者，即取消糧食部執照，勒令停業。粉糧食油一致下挫　　麵粉昨日已大量做開，市勢一瀉千里，較最高峯每袋四百元時，下落百分之六十以上，昨日兵船開一六五元，中間曾略高至一七〇元，收市仍回原盤。大發燈塔一八〇元，藍建成一五〇元，麥根一八〇元，福新麩皮一二〇元。　　食油市場，以銀根仍緊，暗息仍站一元，大多脫貨就現，市况呈供過於求。本廠豆油開九百元，後市下挫至八五〇元收盤，生油仍站原盤，蔴油未有成交，生菜油七百元，亦較昨市下疲一四〇元，熟菜油亦挫百元，現鈔缺乏，一片退票聲。　　雜糧市價跌勢亦猛，黃豆下疲三十元，苞米下降十元，其他貨物均呈供過於求狀態·市價一覽　十一月十一日湘贛粵經濟的氣候  本報記者　毛樹奎　　〔本報訊〕十月下旬，限價政策還在上海發揮威力，而在江西·湖南·廣東早已由「議價」和「自由買賣」取而代之了，我們於十月廿三日到達南昌，那裏正流傳着一個物價的案子，據說：當地某中學的一位訓育主任向一家西服號購製一身衣服，言定工料共一百廿元，店主要求一次付淸，經再三磋商，雙方同意先付半數，其餘半數約定五日後取衣服時繳淸。　　定製西服一套發生無限波折　　那訓育主任到第七天才去取衣服，拖延了二天，而這二天中物價上漲了百分之四十，店主要求補償損失六十元之外，另加廿元，客人自知理屈，也就答允了下來，付了六十元先取回一條褲子，言明翌日再備廿元來取上襖，價筆預算之外的費用，着實使他傷腦筋，好容易到第三天張羅到了去取上襖，不料店主反悔了，因爲這二天中，物價漲得更兇，一定要再加二十元才肯給他上襖，於是惱怒了這位訓育主任，他回頭招來了十餘位學生，用强取去了衣服，這件事鬧到了警局，一面控訴他用强暴手段刦取財物，一面控吿他違反限價……我在南昌祗停留了一個晚上，沒有機會證實這事件的確實與否，也沒有時間探聽下文，然而我們從這一樁案件中窺破了南昌物價動盪的一斑。　　收兌黃金銀元湘贛收效不大　　新經濟措施收兌黃金和銀元，在江西。湖南沒有多大成效，老百姓始終不願意放棄以銀元爲本位的物價，農民仍舊堅持一祖白米要賣十塊錢。長沙中央日報對金銀黑市曾經很坦白地登載過一段新聞：「金號裏沒有黃金買賣，市面上銀元也絕了跡，然而交易仍在地下極秘密地進行着，它還暗地裏指導着物價的漲落，它頑固地佔據着人們的內心」。社會環境與政治組織無法使「八·一九」限價，在這裏嚴格地執行，所以當地政府祗能採用比較和平的「議價」和「勸導」，讓物價在供求關係上尋出一個適當的價格來。　　港澳物價黑市反應異常敏捷　　廣州的物價曾經一度發生過混亂，那是改革幣制時政府所定的金銀外幣收兌價格所引起的，宋子文主席也曾經指出：香港·澳門離開廣州太近，物價對港幣黑市的反應，異常敏捷，因此種種硬性的限價在這裏行不通。記者於十月廿七日到達廣州時，發覺廣州的物價平均高出上海的「八一九」限價，約三倍左右，但是「搶購風潮」，「有價無貨」等怪現象，在廣州是始終沒有出現過。　　物價的刺激性不如上海猛烈　　經濟季候上，贛·湘·粵各地比上海要搶早一個季節，上海人正在徘隊槍購限價品的時候，他們那裏的黑市物價，已由官方認可，因此，開放限價的消息對物價的刺激，遠不如上海的敏捷，如今我們在朔風中掙扎，也許在廣東還可以找到些春意。謝右民等嫌涉貪污當庭收押被提公訴　　〔本報訊〕前上海縣黨部書記長曁現任參議員兼任紫岡鄕合作社理事主席謝石民，及前紫岡鄕鄕長兼合作社營業主任謝耀銓等，因貸放豆餅食汚一案，業經上海地檢處，於八日第四次庭詢時，認爲犯罪嫌疑重大，當庭收押，卽將提起公訴。嘉興組織巡邏隊　　〔本報嘉興十一日訊〕時屆冬防，自衛總隊部與警察局及城中警所常備自衛中隊等，奉令聯合組織巡邏隊，十日起每日下午十二時起至次日黎明六時止，分劃地段實施巡邏，以保治安。又：冬防期屆，各路木橋，均經開始趕修，限本月中旬竣工。八公山的煤田  本報記者　竇白萍　　〔本報田家菴七日訊〕八公山位於一千平方公里的淮南盆地的西南，一塊童山濯濯的荒地，許多年來，它不過在歷史上留下一些陳跡，是漢代所謂八公往詣淮南王安處，也是晋淝水之戰謝玄藉山上草木嚇敗秦王苻堅。今天，八公山身價十倍了，它將是華中有數的大煤鑛，在建國途程上說，這眞是一個大大喜訊。　　機械化　　開拓工程　　記者由九能崗到田家菴再轉往八公山，沿途高壓送電綫的鋼筋水泥柱一字林立，兩邊是廣大的麥田，公路盡頭，爬上高坡，礦塲建築在一個小丘上，走進柵門便是高聳的蒸汽爐烟囪，礦屋白頂紅牆，相映成趣。現在僅是新的開始，計劃中全部採用機械化，一切措施都照「百年大計」的做法。開拓工程，擬分媒層爲上下兩組，上組開採上五層煤，下組開採最下兩層媒，上組開斜井兩座，一座安裝無極帶運送機，無極帶在美國使用也不過近二十年的事，預計裝置後日產煤七千噸，一座專供運送材料人員上下。另開風井一口，上裝漿式抽風機一部，風量每分鐘九萬立方公尺，風壓四吋半，下組也開斜井兩座，亦裝用無極帶運送機，預計日產量三千噸，達成日出煤斤一萬噸的目標。　　一萬噸　　生產理想　　現在，第一二號斜井斜深一二二公尺，均在上組媒層內，斜井及紋車均屬臨時設備，仍帶有探鑛性質。第三號斜井高三點五米，闊五點五米，在下組媒層內，九月剛才開工·一萬噸的生產量目前還是一個理想，它需要首先解決幾個問題，第一，八公山外圍土共環伺，魏鳳樓的龍山部隊也時來竄擾，上月廿二日龍山部隊佔領距礦塲三十華里的淮河北岸鳳台，就使鑛上惶惶不安，幸而旋吿收復，才又安定下來，在今天情形下，對於警衛實付出很大心力。　　產銷運　　三位一體　　第一，產·銷·運·三事是相聯的，一萬噸的產量，必須有相等的運輸力量，目前鑛塲築有輕便鐵路通淮河，以汽輪幾隻運送，最大運輸量不超過千噸，這顯然不够，而淮南鐵路通至裕溪尙待錢來決定。第三，採煤要大量使用機械，沒有錢，什麼也說不上。就是已經決定的三百五十萬美援貸款將來全是機器和器材運來，但據王德滋局長說，這批東西果眞到了，估計需要兩倍於美貸的數字來安排裝置，眞的，這媒田的美麗遠景，唯有靠經費才能扶植得起來。袖珍新聞　　昆山　　〔本報訊〕當局頃決定，凡外埠來縣採購食米，必須向物資調節委會登記　　嘉善　　〔本報訊〕本縣原有四開日報，計嘉善日報，民權報，嘉善商報三種，最近因購紙困難，被迫於十一日起全部休刊。　　合肥　　〔本報訊〕省府近由產米集中地三河，運到食米四萬石，按城內人口，每戶每人配購一斗，日內卽可領條購取·布疋一俟運到，報本核定利潤後，市面卽可漸次恢復。又訊：省府近爲澄淸吏治，革新行政，決組織七個政務督導團，每團派團長一人，團員若干人出發，督導考查六十四縣市政治應興應革事宜，以作澄淸革新張本·　　承德　　〔本報訊〕十一月四日，記者離開這塊故土時，有縫就鑽的流匪，已從冀東。熱北，竄到承德四週，共有十餘股，國軍及地方自衛隊還在各鄕繼續的剿。承德市的建國劇塲還在繼續的唱，救濟機關也在兩日併一日的救，各機關仍在崗位上支掌。另一方面，載客汽車愈顯得不够用了，市塲的拋售東西愈趨向「貴賤的無人要」的悲境了，社會服務申報讀者助學金核准名單（二）　　（愛羣女中）姚瑛·夏　娟（太和助產）張燕·郁麗秋·尤懷　（華　中學）陳琴安·何承秀·丁雪華（惠中中學）方雯琪·孫道貴·蔣作良·范開甲（人和助產）方勤達·吳聘濂·陸敏娟（大經中學）李廉方·阮耕華·馮瑞良（斯盛中學）蔣春園·陳瑞發·倪鎰山·孫蓮芳（崇德女中）李敏珍·陳郁華·王桂芳（　美女中）李燕秋·朱翠英（麥倫中學）張閩·周全中·洪震平。張允若（大江中學）張君政·汪鴻緖（同德助產）劉大蘭　　（注意）核准通知單已寄學校轉達，希仍蓋原印鑑來館具領。郵政問答　　〔答馬文義君問〕（一）藥品由廣州寄杭州，如已

<p>自由談寒山寺與楓橋  吳庸　　林語堂著蘇東坡傳中有云：一地景色之美與不美，半靠景色，半靠賞玩景色者本人；如非其人，縱令身處天堂，亦不會覺其景色之可愛，云云。此論爲對東坡謫居黃州，身處臨臯破驛，然仍認爲該地風景宜人，自得其樂而發。意謂實際上臨皋風景也許並不秀麗，其所謂「宜人」者，只存於東坡之想像中耳。　　嘗遊姑蘇城外寒山寺及張繼夜泊之楓橋，時在戰前二年。該時該寺，破敗傾圯，舉首望頂，可見天際白雲過隙，只是一個極平常的破寺。楓橋江面狹隘，闊恐不過二丈，更無雅趣。參以林氏此論，信然。張繼夜泊楓橋詩之意境，本是張繼自造之天地。只要詩人所自創之天地確乎美妙可觀，本不得以其非眞而見輕。比方寒山寺的那一個鐘，今日所懸着的固然不是張繼夜泊時的那一個，就是日人移去的亦未必卽是原來的鐘。然假定今日的張繼第二於民國三十七年夜泊楓橋時也賦了一首同樣佳妙的詩，則此詩自然仍是好詩。前人本來已經說過：「雨打芭蕉」固然富有雅趣，然雨打窗外破蓆，其聲與「雨打芭蕉」亦殊無異。如果室內的人誤信是「雨打芭蕉」聲，因而雅興勃發，靈感衝動，吟了一首好詩，則殊可不必因爲後來發現只是雨打破蓆而毀詩，其理正同。　　據說往昔有一位酷愛古董的富戶，聽人說起某姓人家有一隻古代的缸，極爲名貴，價値連城，他就刻意要想購得此缸。而該古缸的所有人以其爲家傳至寳，不願出售，只允富戶赴其家賞鑒。富戶賞鑒之下，見其古色斑爛，認爲的係三代以上的古物，當塲又表重價購取之意。該姓人家經他屢次懇求之下，也就願意割愛情讓。於是富戶把那個古董移到自己室中的天井裏，早晚摩挲賞玩，歡喜得不忍須臾離去。只是後來某夜大雨，富戶次晨醒來，再去把玩古缸，然已不知去向，只剩了地上的一堆爛泥，原來已被大雨冲毀了。欲望這位富戶聞得雨打破蓆聲而賦詩，想是不可能的，因爲他只有見了古剎古鐘而欲移諸私人客室的雅興。其結果是不啻重價購得了一張破蓆，那是不足怪的。東鱗西爪  宋賢　　英國國家廣播公司共有工作者六百人。每日以二十四國言語，用二十六種不同波長經常對二億聽衆廣播。　　美國最早的大學是（一）哈佛（一六三六），（二）威廉馬利學院（一六九三），（三）耶魯（一七〇一）·至一九四〇年止，美國已畢業大學生共三，九〇〇，〇〇〇人，中學生二一，〇〇〇，〇〇〇人·現有大學生一，五〇〇，〇〇〇人，中學生七，〇〇〇，〇〇〇人，小學生二一，〇〇〇，〇〇〇人。　　美國屈來克第修理市政　，在地底下發現一只老鼠的寳藏。有三百零一塊糖菓，八包香烟，五袋焦鹽花生，一打雪茄，一包咳嗽藥。和一本銀行存摺。　　一八九五年時，美國祗有四輛汽車。　　日本自戰爭結束後已成立三十三個政黨。豐子愷與曾臥石  東方旣白　　這是一種巧合，豐子愷書畫展與曾臥石書畫展，同在台北中山堂光復廳樓上舉行。豐中愷先生是當代名馳中外的書畫家，曾臥石是新露頭角的「小神童」，前者是一位鬚髮蒼白的老先生，後者乃是一個六歲的小孩子。一老一幼，平分秋色的各佔了會塲的一半，眞所謂「相映成趣」了。　　豐子愷先生的畫展訂於本月六日舉行，而我却是五日去參觀的。作品一百八十餘件，非賣品竟佔了一百零八件。其中有很多的作品我們已在報章雜誌上欣賞過，一見之下，覺得有幾分眼熟。但因這是「眞蹟」而不是翻版的，看來更覺意味深長·豐先生是蒼老了，而他的畫却是一首平靜而現實的詩，含蓄着深刻的人情味，給人們以人生之沉思，遐想，和童年天眞的回憶。精湛，活潑，淸新，而且現實！　　曾臥石，這個六歲的小孩子，台灣南部嘉義人。四歲時就以書法聞名，人皆以神童呼之。　　桌子上堆了一些白宣紙與筆墨等，一個胸前帶着飯兜的小孩兒在椅子上，執筆疾書，姿態端正而自然。筆法，筆順，絲毫不亂。整張大宣紙，頃刻而就·一幅是「月落烏啼霜滿天……」的張繼夜泊詩，另一幅是「自强不息」的大橫披。寫完之後，跳下椅子，吃起糖果來。一時參觀的人，無不稱奇。我摸摸他的頭說：「你眞不得了！」他用很流利的國語說：「我眞不得了？你眞了不得！」　　凡見到他的人，無不爲他惋惜。他眞是一個聰明的孩子，但却「當街賣藝，淪落江湖」了。　　豐子愷與曾臥石，相形之下，固不可同日而語，但凑在一個屋子里，一老一少，給人以無限感觸。　　於欽敬當代老畫家之餘，更應該救救孩子！（寄自台北）蘇州近事雜詠　（下）  瘦鵑　　漫云民以食爲天，冷郤吳門萬竈烟；結隊淸遊艱飲啄，空垂涎滴過觀前。　　觀前街與玄妙觀所有菜館點心店，僉以原料採辦不易，紛紛停業，滬上士女之結隊來遊者，苦不得食，敗興而去。　　炭薪已盡難爲繼，茶竈塵封釜甑凉；飢火中燒正不耐，更無熱水潤枯腸。　　隣近一熟水店，俗所謂老虎竈者，爲愚家飲料取給之所，茲以燃料吿竭，猝罷其業。　　一見戎裝膽爲摧，迎門揖讓不容推，升堂入室渾閒事，榻畔由他鼾睡來。　　比來恒有糾糾桓桓者强入民居賃廡，吳人懾其威，敢怒而不敢言，臥榻之旁，遂亦不得不容他人鼾睡矣。　　媚水明山都减色，洞天福地等荒田；而今休說蘇州好，如此蘇州劇可憐！　　蘇州夙與杭州並有人間天堂之稱，今若是，直駸駸乎與地獄近矣。噫！　　——作於八一九限價取消之前二日——　　此間世界報載上海近訊：「癟三」變作「黃牛」，黃牛變作「財主」，窮的都富了！原因是能在中紡門口搶購到五圓的東西，轉手賣二十圓，就是四倍之利，又藥房門外排號占位，只將空位出讓，卽可得三五圓的「頂費」，無本之利，優厚非常，惟黃牛有此勇氣，惟癟三善作黃牛。　　「癟三」的大名，在北方　耳中，久有所聞，雖北方無此名詞，而習知其行爲，是不事正業而專於軌外求生活，文言之則甘於末流，成爲第二天性者，在此變態社會變態經濟的時期，得到超越正常之機會而發揮其活力，亦算是「時勢造英雄」了。「黃牛」之義，據說是牛能耕田攻土，黃牛力大角堅，能於荆棘中衝開道路故凡在人羣裏擠擠搶搶，且得機卽上，以十足之勇氣獲取壟斷權則比之黃牛之善於「鑽」「攻」，亦頗妙肖。　　北方之「囤積」「搗把」「跑單帮」，合稱「搗」「跑」「囤」三字訣，許多不正常的「生財有大道」，不自今始，蓋淪陷八年中，日寇日酋大宗霸佔於上，大「囤」大「搗」任意橫行，社會經濟久已變態。華人在彼時若按正常生理，實已無法維持·「跑跑」「囤囤」，黑心發財者有之，卽爲生活計，不得不然者亦有之，馴至養成一種習慣。罪魁禍首，仍在日寇。勝利以來，承其餘敝，重以內亂及其他不祥之事實，以致變態經濟，有增無减，變態生活，再接再厲。凡熟於「搗」·「跑」·「囤」三字訣者，生活總有辦法，精神常見興奮·卽如此次限價潮流，凡通衢廣市，正當商店，大半貨空人閑，冷寂如古寺，而各小市之攤販，則貨色充盈，大呼小叫，金圓券一疊一把的「滿不在乎」，或堆如亂紙，或飛來拋去，翩翩作蝴蝶舞，他們說，每天跑跑喊喊，晚來結算，總可以賺個「百兒八十塊」。以月計之，則二三千金圓，眞使薪水階級的「老爺」「先生」們舌橋而不能下。</p>

<h3>Re-establishing Exchange Rates for Gold, Silver, and Foreign Currencies: People Allowed to Possess but Not Trade; Preparation for Manufacturing Gold and Silver Coins</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 11th] To gain the people's trust in the Gold Yuan, the government has revised the Gold Yuan issuance measures and the measures for handling gold, silver, and foreign currencies held by the people, re-establishing the gold content of the Gold Yuan and the exchange rates of gold, silver, silver coins, and foreign currencies against the Gold Yuan. People are allowed to possess gold, silver, and foreign currencies, but except for silver coins, they are not allowed to trade or circulate them. At the same time, preparations are underway to mint Gold Yuan coins in denominations of one yuan, five yuan, ten yuan, fifty yuan, and one hundred yuan. It is stipulated that people can exchange Gold Yuan notes for Gold Yuan coins, and before the Gold Yuan coins are minted, they can exchange for gold or silver coins according to the ratio. These measures were proposed by the newly appointed Minister of Finance, Xu Kan, and were first submitted to the Kuomintang Central Political Committee for discussion before being passed by the Provisional Political Affairs Meeting at 3 PM on the 11th. The meeting was personally chaired by President Chiang, and after the meeting, it was immediately submitted to the Political Affairs Meeting for discussion. It was passed and implemented from today. Some people have expressed deep satisfaction with this measure, believing that it will stabilize the current near-chaotic economic situation and strengthen the people's confidence in the Gold Yuan.</p>
<h3>Supplementary Budget for the Second Half of the Year Enters Review Stage</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 11th] The first supplementary budget proposal for the central government's general budget and special budget for the second half of the 37th year has been submitted to the Legislative Yuan by the Executive Yuan after being reported at the 18th regular meeting, and it has now entered the review stage. It is reported that the revenue part of the supplementary budget proposal for the general budget is drafted in accordance with the provisions of the financial and economic emergency decree, and the increase in revenue includes direct taxes, commodity taxes, state-produced tobacco and alcohol taxes, salt taxes, mining taxes, etc., as well as fines, regulatory fees, and property income. The increase in these two subjects is the most, about seven times the original budget. Customs revenue is estimated based on US aid imports, trade imports, and self-provided foreign exchange imports, and the supplementary amount is about twice the original budget. There is no increase in land tax collection in kind and state-owned enterprise surplus. The expenditure part includes all expenses that have been supplemented for emergency allocations as approved by the Executive Yuan's 16th meeting on September 15th, and have not yet completed the legislative procedure, and they are all included as they are. Among them, the salaries of public employees, teachers, and military and police personnel account for the largest part, about 8.4 times more than the original budget, followed by office expenses, which are about 6 times more than the original budget. The public expenses payable to supervisors at all levels have been listed as new subjects since August. In addition, the revision of the foreign exchange rate and the arrangement of debt expenses have been increased or reduced separately according to the various methods determined after the currency system reform, but the total amount is still a considerable amount of supplementary expenditure. The total amount of food and non-staple food expenses for military officers and soldiers, public-funded students in national schools, recipients of relief agencies, and prisoners has also increased by one and a half times compared to the original budget. In total, the actual increase in revenue and expenditure of the supplementary general budget is 461,085,236 yuan, which is about 4.3 times more than the original legal currency converted into gold yuan, which is 107,873,000 yuan, and the revenue and expenditure can still be offset. As for the special budget, the revenue part is mostly increased by the sale price of property and materials, and the cotton yarn tax in the customs import surcharges and commodity taxes is also supplemented, while the requisition of grain has been slightly reduced. In the expenditure part, the expenditure of the national defense authority on the salaries of officers and soldiers and transportation expenses has been greatly supplemented. The expenditure of the Ministry of Transportation is mainly increased due to the foreign exchange conversion difference and business subsidies. In addition, the expenditure of the Ministry of Food and the subsidy expenditure of various provinces and cities have also been approved. In total, the actual increase in the revenue and expenditure of the supplementary special budget is four times the legal currency converted into gold yuan listed in the original special budget. However, the bond revenue and loan revenue in the revenue part are all insufficient to cover the expenditure, and funds need to be raised to make up for it.</p>

<h3>Thoughts on the Anniversary of the Birth of the Father of the Nation</h3>
<p>Today is the anniversary of the birth of the Father of the Nation. On this auspicious day with clear skies and refreshing air, we should be joyful and celebrate the birthday of the Father of the Republic of China and the nation enthusiastically. However, looking north to Biyun Temple and south to Zijin Mountain, half of China is shrouded in the flames of war, filled with the sounds of killing, and most of the people are struggling on the brink of starvation. Even paying respects at his mausoleum is impossible. The nation is in turmoil, the world is in uproar. If we wish to realize the ideals of the New China based on the Three Principles of the People, which the Father of the Nation strived for during forty years of revolution, how much more effort will we, the people who came after him, especially the members of the Kuomintang, need to make? As of today, all we can feel towards the spirit of the Father of the Nation is deep shame and guilt!</p>
<p>As we recall the history of China since the birth of the Father of the Nation eighty-two years ago, face up to the various crises lurking within the country, and look forward to the future of our nation's revolution and reconstruction, we are filled with a myriad of complex emotions and do not know where to begin. But when we think of the life of the Father of the Nation, we are given a hundredfold of courage. As long as we can be as sincere and strive as hard as the Father of the Nation, and everyone follows his principles, what is there to fear about the success of the revolution and national reconstruction? And what is there to fear about the nation not becoming prosperous, strong, healthy and happy? The most urgent matter now is that the entire nation, from top to bottom, must deeply reflect, severely blame ourselves, and thoroughly be determined, and not allow any slightest decline!</p>
<p>The life of the Father of the Nation was burning with a passion for patriotism and saving the world. With his supreme and unwavering spirit, he led the national revolution for forty years, never fearing hardship, never avoiding danger, never yielding, and fighting hard, until the very last moment of his life, still not forgetting the great cause of "Peace, Struggle, Save China." We have such a great leader leading us in the revolution and national reconstruction. As long as we, starting from the moment of his passing, follow the Father of the Nation's last words: "The revolution has not yet succeeded, comrades must still strive" and "Peace, Struggle, Save China," then we can absolutely believe that national affairs would never have reached the unmanageable situation of today. Looking back at the past twenty-odd years, whether it is the members of the Kuomintang, or the people who follow the Father of the Nation's teachings, they either lacked sufficient enthusiasm or acted insincerely in the great cause of revolution and national reconstruction. Some even degenerated and became corrupted in the name of revolution, becoming obstacles to revolution and national reconstruction. Reflecting on the past and present, we cannot help but feel deeply saddened.</p>
<p>What's past cannot be mended, but what's to come can be pursued. We have let down the Father of the Nation in many ways in the past, and we don't need to dwell on what has already happened. But from now on, we must change our ways and cleanse our hearts, so as not to let down the Father of the Nation, nor the Three Principles of the People. Although the current situation is critical, it is by no means impossible to salvage. We believe that, for now, the only way is to follow the Father of the Nation's last words, thoroughly revolutionize, and strive to build the nation. The government should prioritize the people in everything and consider everything for the people, no longer acting arrogantly, closing itself off, and always thinking that "the people can be made to follow, but cannot be made to understand," or even doing things that are contrary to the people's likes and dislikes. And the people should sincerely cooperate with the government and work together. As long as everyone works together, makes a great determination, any difficulty can be overcome, and the revolution and national reconstruction will surely succeed. Moreover, we can only discover the path to national rejuvenation from the Father of the Nation's last words. The Father of the Nation's revolutionary theory is nationalistic, not class-based, and can be called the only way to save the nation. The reason why the eight-year war of resistance could turn defeat into victory was because of the Father of the Nation's nationalism, which enabled all the people of the country, regardless of north or south, regardless of men or women, to sacrifice everything to fight for national freedom. Now, the war is raging throughout the country, and its nature is a war between nationalism and communism. As long as the government can understand the Father of the Nation's revolutionary theory that transcends class, pay special attention to the common people, and seek to stabilize the people's livelihood, all sources of unrest can be eliminated invisibly. At the same time, as long as the people can know that communism comes with its international aggressive background, they will naturally be able to jointly inspire the national spirit of shared hatred against the enemy to extinguish this traitorous flame! We must reverse the overall situation and turn things around to be worthy of the spirit of the Father of the Nation in heaven!</p>
<h3>US Economic Cooperation Administration Intensifies Grain Shipments to China; Hong Kong Government Announces Shipment of 10,000 Tons of Rice to Shanghai</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 10th] Government authorities announced on the 10th that the Economic Cooperation Administration is intensifying grain shipments to China. The current grain shortage in China is not due to the agency's failure to provide assistance as scheduled, but rather due to the Chinese government's failure to supply grain for October, November, and December in accordance with the agreement established with the agency months ago. During the period when new grain was harvested in China in March, the agency had planned not to ship grain during this period. Now, due to the urgent situation, the agency is expediting the shipment of flour and wheat from the northwestern United States to China for continued distribution. This batch of grain was originally scheduled to be shipped early next year, but has now been shipped ahead of schedule and is expected to arrive in China successively from late November. The agency has also allocated another $3,801,000 to continue purchasing Burmese rice for distribution in South and Central China.

<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 11th] Information from the National Resources Commission: Due to military reasons, the land and water transportation of Kailuan coal is not smooth, so there is a large amount of coal in stock.

<h3>Chief of the Culture and Education Committee of the North China General Suppression Command, Qin Juchuan, Gives a Politically Significant Speech; Optimistic About the Overall Situation in North China</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 11th] After the defeat in the Northeast war, it was widely rumored among North China officials that the Commander-in-Chief would issue an important announcement on the current situation to stabilize people's minds. However, the announcement has not yet been issued. Qin Juchuan, the chief of the Culture and Education Committee of the North China General Suppression Command, suddenly gave a politically significant speech to teachers of primary and secondary schools in the city yesterday. It is generally believed that this speech is the incarnation of Mr. Fu's announcement. Qin revealed in his speech: (1) The Central Government has delegated full authority over North China to Commander-in-Chief Fu. Three hours before the President left Beiping, he told Mr. Fu that if the measures of the North China General Suppression Command conflict with the central government's laws and regulations, Mr. Fu's opinion should be the basis. Commander-in-Chief Fu can now let go and do things. (2) Before the loss of the Northeast, American officials had advocated direct aid to North China, but Fu refused because he wanted to maintain national unity and respect the central government's authority. He continued: After Commander-in-Chief Fu returned from Nanjing, he was very optimistic about the current situation, saying: "The defeat in the Northeast means that the situation in North China is serious and must be reversed with all our strength. The defeat in the Northeast means that the pressure on North China has increased, but it has not fundamentally shaken our survival, but rather is an opportunity for transformation, because: 1. The loss of the Northeast will make the United States value Europe less; 2. The loss of the Northeast will be a strategic change and the best time to strengthen total war; 3. In the future, North China will be commanded by a traditional unified command, which is beneficial to North China; 4. Now that the Northeast has fallen, those corrosive forces and people without firm confidence have left, which reduces the heavy burden on North China."</p>
<h3>Verdict of the International Military Tribunal; Accusations of the Japanese Army's Barbaric Acts Confirmed; Tojo and Others Should Be Held Responsible</h3>
<p>[United Press, Tokyo, 11th] The International Military Tribunal continued to read the verdict today, believing that the Japanese army and navy, from 1931 to the time of surrender in 1945, had abused torture, "raped, killed, and committed other most barbaric and inhuman acts." According to international law, all government officials and military leaders during this period should be held responsible for their duties. The atrocities of the Japanese army were the same everywhere, which shows that they were secretly ordered by the Japanese government or its individual military commanders, or deliberately condoned. Defendants such as Tojo, Itagaki, Hirota, Hiranuma, Ko　, Take, Sada, Umezu, Kimura, Matsui, Hata Shunroku, Oshima, Shimada, Hoshino, Suzuki, and Shigemitsu Kui, etc., should be held especially responsible.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 11th] The verdict of the International Military Tribunal pointed out that the Japanese troops occupying Nanjing were barbaric troops. During the first six weeks of their occupation of the Chinese capital, they massacred 200,000 civilians and prisoners. This kind of barbaric behavior of the Japanese army cannot be regarded as an uncontrollable military action at the time. The large-scale rape, killing, and arson actions of the Japanese army continued for at least a week after the fall of Nanjing.</p>

<h3>Marshall to Return Home to Meet Truman; Comprehensive Review of the World Situation; Truman-Stalin Meeting Unlikely if the Soviet Union Does Not Show Sincerity for Peace</h3>
<p>[United Press, Paris, 10th] The US delegation to the UN General Assembly announced tonight that Secretary of State Marshall will return to Washington in late November to conduct a comprehensive review of the world situation with President Truman. The possibility of direct US-Soviet negotiations is also included. News of a possible meeting between Stalin and Truman has spread from Moscow and Rome, which has greatly excited the UN General Assembly, but Marshall has neither confirmed nor denied it.</p>
<p>[United Press, Key West, Florida, 10th] President Truman's secretary, Ayers, stated that there are no arrangements for a Truman-Stalin meeting. He reiterated the President's previous statement that he would be happy to meet with Stalin at any time if he wished to come to the United States.</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 11th] Diplomatic circles here believe that the Soviet Union's interest in a "Truman-Stalin Peace Conference" is another attempt by the Soviet Union to undermine the unity of Western countries. Senior diplomatic officials stated that they believe the Kremlin will use the Truman-Stalin meeting to achieve purely propaganda value. They predict that the Soviet Union will not miss the opportunity and will use this meeting between the two powers to weaken cooperation between the United States and non-communist countries in Western Europe. According to their assessment, the Truman-Stalin talks will provide the Soviet Union with further weapons to undermine the Marshall Plan and the ongoing North Atlantic Alliance. According to an 8th report in the "Washington Times-Herald" regarding the possible brewing of a Truman-Stalin meeting, which was transcribed by TASS, all Moscow newspapers published it prominently on the 10th, which is generally considered to indicate that the Soviet Union does not reject it. However, the opinion of the State Department is that this meeting may be useless or even harmful, and this matter must wait until the United States has established its military strength before the Soviet Union can understand that the US foreign policy is "seeking truth from facts." Diplomats further believe that if the Soviet Union is indeed interested in peace, it has ample opportunities to express goodwill to the West in Berlin, at the United Nations, and elsewhere. US officials believe that a Truman-Stalin meeting in the near future is unlikely to happen for the following reasons: (1) The Soviet Union has already shown that it has no sincerity in reaching any agreement other than a "paper agreement." (2) After Stalin and Truman meet, they may use more "peace propaganda," minor concessions, and superficial cooperation to overturn the US preparation plan, which will give the Soviet Union more time to tighten its control over satellite countries and establish fifth columns in other countries. (3) If the Truman-Stalin meeting fails to reach an agreement, it will inevitably accelerate the showdown between the two countries.</p>
<h3>Jiang Tingfu Speaks at the Political Committee; Opposes Soviet Disarmament Proposal; Demands Disarmament of Fifth Columns</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper] Paris, 11th Broadcast: Chinese representative Jiang Tingfu stated in the UN General Assembly Political Committee that the Communist Party is using 50,000 Japanese prisoners of war to fight against the government. When discussing the Soviet Union's proposal to reduce the military strength of the five powers by one-third, Jiang stated that China should propose that the United Nations take action to disarm fifth columns around the world. Jiang stated that the Japanese prisoners of war captured by the Soviet Union are being used by the Northeast Communist Army as artillerymen, pilots, and tank soldiers. In addition, there are 30,000 Japanese serving the Communist Army in the Northeast. Jiang explained that the government is extremely concerned about the rapid advance of the Communist Army, and China will never accept the Soviet Union's proposal in its current state.</p>
<h3>Soviet Union Supports Israel; Opposes Bunche Plan; Security Council Considers Enforcing Ceasefire Order</h3>
<p>[United Press, Paris, 10th] UN Acting Mediator Bunche suggested on the 10th that the United Nations try to take steps to designate most of the Negev region in southern Palestine as a demilitarized zone. This action would require a large-scale withdrawal of Israeli troops from the positions they recently captured from the Egyptian army. Bunche's proposal has been submitted to the Security Council's seven-member committee for consideration of how to implement the Security Council's order. The committee may study methods of enforcement if the Jews refuse to withdraw from the Negev region. The Jewish side has already hinted that they will refuse this order. The Security Council also discussed the Palestinian issue on the 10th and listened to Soviet representative Malik's request to establish an Arab-Jewish peace conference as soon as possible. Malik urged the Security Council to order direct negotiations between the Arab and Jewish sides to "establish a formal peace" through Bunche. The request of Bunche or the Soviet representative implied their rejection of Bunche's proposal on the 9th, believing that this proposal is only a ceasefire and not a comprehensive peace plan. The Soviet Union's position seems to be very much in favor of the Jewish side, but it is inconsistent with the views of Britain and France, and may also be different from the views of the United States.</p>

<h3>New Crisis in the French Cabinet</h3>

<h3>Soviet Union Violently Criticizes US Policy Toward Japan</h3>
<p>Says it Actually Allows the Revival of Japanese Reactionaries</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Tokyo, 11th] Soviet representative to the Allied Council for Japan, Derevyanko, delivered a speech at the founding of the Japanese-Soviet Club on the night of the 10th, fiercely attacking the United States' policy in Japan. He criticized anti-Soviet propaganda for completely erasing the fact that the Soviet Union actually wanted to conclude a peace treaty with Japan as soon as possible and the Soviet Union's efforts for this treaty, and for not making it public to the Japanese public. The actual responsibility for the delay of the peace treaty with Japan should be borne by other countries, but this is not known to the Japanese people. He also severely criticized the US occupation policy. He also attacked the US occupying authorities for disregarding the Far Eastern Commission's instructions to disarm Japan, and for allowing the revival of Japanese reactionaries. Finally, he attacked the US authorities for taking brutal offensives against legitimate labor unions, "and a terrorist police regime has now been formed."</p>

<p>[United Press, London, 11th] The conference of six countries (Britain, the United States, France, Belgium, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg) to discuss the ownership system of Ruhr industry opened here today. France opposes the Anglo-American occupying military government's proposal to transfer control of the steel industry to the German government in the future. Britain and the United States are trying to ease French emotions, because if there is a gap in the West's handling of the German issue, serious consequences will occur in the East-West Berlin negotiations. French Foreign Minister Schuman lodged a strong protest with Britain and the United States on the 10th, insisting that the Ruhr be placed under international control. Well-informed sources believe that the French representative will explain the impact of the Anglo-American resolution on French domestic affairs, as the Queuille government is currently facing a major crisis of labor unrest.</p>

<p>The above-mentioned three ports in the North Atlantic and Mediterranean have large-scale warship repair facilities. The Evening Standard also stated that the United States may request that Britain hand over a naval base in British territory entirely for the use of the US fleet for its disposal.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, London, 11th] According to a report in the Daily Telegraph today, the Western European Union countries have reached an agreement on the issue of the strength undertaken by each country under the joint organization of the European continent.

<h3>Greek Government Expresses No Compromise with Guerrillas</h3>
<p>Automatic Surrender Will be Granted Amnesty</p>
<p>[United Press, Athens, 10th] Eight former Greek cabinet members sent a letter to Prime Minister Sophoulis yesterday, requesting the government to accept the proposal of Australian Foreign Minister Evatt at the UN General Assembly to hold peace talks with the three communist countries to the north. Sophoulis replied today, stating that compromising with the northern communist guerrillas is tantamount to surrendering to forces that the Greek people despise. This move will not only fail to end the war in the north, but will also expand the bloodshed, ultimately leading to the extinction of the Greek race. Although compromise is impossible, the government will still grant amnesty to guerrillas who lay down their weapons and surrender. Gentlemen have the right to speak on national affairs, but do not represent public opinion, and this kind of proposition is actually an unpatriotic act.</p>

<h3>Political Committee Urges Greece and Three Neighboring Countries to Restore Normal Diplomatic Relations; Direct Negotiations to Resolve Refugee Issues; Soviet Proposal to Withdraw Foreign Troops from Greek Territory Rejected</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 10th] The UN General Assembly Political Committee unanimously passed the Australian representative's proposal tonight, inviting the Greek representative and representatives from its northern neighbors to hold direct negotiations to resolve disputes.</p>
<p>[United Press, Paris, 10th] The Soviet Union's proposal to withdraw "all foreign troops and foreign military personnel" from Greek territory was rejected by the Political Committee by a vote of 38 to 7.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 10th] A strange incident occurred during the Political Committee's discussion of the Greek issue today. The committee adopted parts of the Soviet Union's proposal on the Greek issue out of context, causing the meaning of the adopted sections to be completely contrary to the meaning of the original Soviet proposal, forcing the Soviet representative to abstain from voting during the vote. The introduction of the Soviet Union's original proposal criticized foreign interference in Greece (obviously referring to the United States), demanded the withdrawal of all foreign troops from Greece, restricted the powers of the Balkan Committee, demanded that the Greek government stop racial discrimination, and restore diplomatic relations with neighboring countries to resolve border refugees and other issues. However, during the vote, the committee rejected the statement in the preamble that the current situation in Greece was the result of foreign interference by a vote of 49 to 6; the first section of the Soviet proposal was passed by a vote of 53 to 2, requesting Greece to establish diplomatic relations with Bulgaria and Albania; the second section was passed with 49 votes to 6 abstentions, inviting countries such as Greece, Bulgaria, and Albania to resolve border and refugee issues. At the afternoon meeting, the committee rejected the section demanding that the Greek government stop racial discrimination against the Macedonian and Albanian minorities by a vote of 21 to 13 (9 abstentions), and passed the fifth section of the Soviet proposal by a vote of 44 to 1 (1 abstention), requiring the governments of Greece, Bulgaria, and Albania to submit reports to the United Nations Secretariat within six months on the progress of establishing diplomatic relations and resolving border and refugee issues.</p>

<p>Bartering 20,000 Bolts of Cotton Cloth for Rice</p>
<p>The Management Office Continues Investigation</p>
<p>[Our Dispatch] Yu Jiyu, Chief Secretary of the Inspection Committee, stated that the Management Office is continuing to investigate the bartering of 20,000 bolts of cotton cloth for rice. As of now, the transaction ledgers have not been submitted to the office. According to rice merchants, they were ordered to supply Shanghai with price-controlled rice starting October 10th until the end of October. The purchase price of the controlled-price rice was based on the market price in the producing areas, which was higher than the controlled price. Based on this calculation, the rice merchants suffered a significant loss, and the government needs to supply price-controlled cloth worth 80,000 gold yuan to compensate for the loss.</p>
<p>Unprecedented Crowding on Two Railway Lines</p>
<p>More Than a Dozen Casualties in One Day</p>
<p>[Our Dispatch] The level of crowding on the Shanghai-Nanjing and Shanghai-Hangzhou railway lines in recent days can be described as unprecedented. The North Station and West Station of this city are packed with people all day long. The long queues of dozens of feet for buying tickets are often dispersed by the crowds. Injuries and fainting due to squeezing are commonplace. The white Red Cross ambulances of the railway hospital are frequently parked in the square of the North Station to transport injured passengers. Station employees are overworked and hoarse. The situation along the line is also chaotic. Yesterday alone, there were 11 unfortunate incidents of passengers falling from trains on the two lines. An elderly passenger (name unknown) at the West Railway Station died on the spot from being squeezed. It is difficult to immediately calculate the total number of casualties. The estimated total is over 30 people.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the operation of the trains was nearly in a state of disorder. The Qiantang train to Shanghai was four hours late, and other passenger trains could not depart or arrive on time. Every time a train departed, the top of the train and the area around the locomotive were filled with passengers. Even after a train had started, passengers still tried to squeeze into the train at the last second, and many were left hanging outside the train by holding onto the train windows and doors.</p>
<p>Investigating Responsibility for the Falling-from-Train Tragedy</p>
<p>The Railway Bureau's Police Department and Transportation Department are currently investigating the responsibility for the tragic accident of passengers falling from the 27th passenger train near the West Station yesterday morning (reported in yesterday's newspaper). It is reported that the waiting rooms for third and fourth-class passengers were overcrowded, and the ticket-checking order was chaotic, causing a large number of passengers to enter the station without having their tickets checked, resulting in the train being overloaded. Passengers climbed onto the roof of the train, leading to the tragedy. The bodies of the deceased have been sent to the morgue for examination. The prosecutors of the District Prosecutor's Office are conducting autopsies and keeping records. The injured who were sent to the railway hospital include Chen Zhongheng, Liang Guihong, Ruan Chengmu, and Tanaka Sheng. The whereabouts of other missing passengers are still under investigation.</p>
<p>Night Trains to Shanghai Advance Departure Time</p>
<p>After the temporary martial law was announced in this city, Chen Bozhuang, the director of the two railway bureaus, negotiated with the municipal authorities because the martial law time started at 11:00 p.m., which caused difficulties in the railway bureau's operations. He requested that the start time be extended to midnight. It is heard that Mayor Wu has agreed to consider it and it may be realized. At the same time, the night trains to Shanghai from Nanjing and Hangzhou, which were originally scheduled to arrive after 11:00 p.m., will advance their departure times. Detailed measures are being studied.</p>
<p>Chef of Lao Zhengxing Restaurant Died Returning to His Hometown After Being Squeezed on the Jiangjing Steamer</p>
<p>[Taicang Dispatch] Zhang Ayao, 50 years old, a resident of 59 Minguo Road, was a chef at Lao Zhengxing Restaurant. Yesterday at 5:30 p.m., he was returning to his hometown. When he arrived at Pier No. 3 to board the Jiangjing Steamer, Zhang fainted from being squeezed in the crowded passenger flow. He was taken to the hospital but died.</p>
<p>Abnormal Crowding of Passengers on Shanghai-Ningbo Steamers</p>
<p>China Merchants Bureau Strengthens Order Maintenance</p>
<p>The Shanghai-Ningbo line of the China Merchants Bureau has seen abnormal crowding of passengers. It is heard that because rice, pork, chicken, and duck are cheaper in Ningbo than in Shanghai, peddlers are seizing the opportunity to profit. In addition, because rice is difficult to purchase in this city, prices are high, and life is not easy, those who do not need to stay in Shanghai are returning to their hometowns in Ning Shao, leading to unprecedented crowding of passengers and making it difficult to maintain order at the pier and on the ship. The company has adopted a method of limiting ticket purchases to restrict the number of people. Unfortunately, this has also led to passengers without tickets rushing to board the ship. The Jiangya Steamer, originally scheduled to depart from Shanghai on the evening of the 10th, was unable to sail due to the swarm of passengers without tickets. It was delayed until after 11:00 p.m. before departing for Ningbo. The situation at the pier on the evening of the 11th was still extremely chaotic, resulting in trampling and injuries to passengers. After the company received the report, it immediately dispatched more police officers to maintain order and originally planned to add a Sunday sailing in addition to the existing sailings from Monday to Saturday. Starting next week, landing craft will also be used in conjunction with the original sailings to travel between Shanghai and Ningbo.</p>
<p>First Trial of Zhan Peilin and Others in the Paper Hoarding Case</p>
<p>Both Defendants Deny Hoarding</p>
<p>[Our Dispatch] Zhan Peilin, chairman of the Paper Industry Association and owner of Yiji Xing Paper Shop, and his brother, Zhan Yutian, factory director of Yizhong Paper Mill, have been indicted by the Special Criminal Court on suspicion of hoarding and profiteering. The case was tried yesterday by Judge Jiang Shanchu of the Special Criminal Court. Zhan Peilin flatly denied the accusation of hoarding, stating that according to the paper registration regulations of the Social Affairs Bureau, only newsprint and rough-edged paper were regulated, and the inventory should not exceed one-quarter of the total sales of the previous year. According to the defendant, the turnover of Yiji Xing Paper Shop last year was approximately 9,000 reams, and the seized goods amounted to over 900 reams, which is less than one-quarter. Zhan Yutian stated that the 870 rolls of various paper stock seized were raw materials for papermaking and not daily necessities, so they were not subject to control. The court then summoned witnesses, and because further investigation was needed, the hearing was adjourned to a later date.</p>
<p>Appeal Judgment in the Stock Dumping Case</p>
<p>Sentences of Three Defendants Reduced</p>
<p>[Our Dispatch] Du Weiping, Lin Legeng, and Xu Yang Shuyao, the defendants in the stock dumping case, were originally sentenced by the District Court to eight months of imprisonment for Du, eight months for Lin, and seven months for Xu Yangshuyao. The defendants were dissatisfied and appealed to the High Court. Yesterday was the date for the judgment to be announced. Du and the other two defendants were released on bail and did not appear in court. Fang Fushu and Gu Xianggui, Lin's defense lawyers, and Ru Baobao Yi, Xu's defense lawyer, were present to hear the judgment. At 10 a.m., Judge Chen Zhensheng, on behalf of Chief Judge Xiao, read out the main text of the judgment: "Du Weiping, jointly and continuously buying and selling outside the exchange to which he belongs, and using the same calculation method for the entrustor, is sentenced to six months of imprisonment. Lin Legeng, jointly and not within the exchange to which he belongs, buying and selling, and using the same calculation method for the entrustor, is sentenced to six months of imprisonment. Xu Yangshuyao, outside the exchange, trading at the market price, specializing in calculating profits and losses, selling short, is sentenced to four months of imprisonment. If the sentence is commuted to a fine, it shall be calculated at three gold yuan per day." After the judgment was read, the defendants' lawyers stated that the commutation to a fine may not be approved when the sentence is executed, and requested that it be clearly stated that the commutation to a fine is approved to facilitate execution. The court stated that there was no precedent for this point and instructed that a separate written request be submitted for a separate ruling.</p>
<p>Jin Hua Cigarette Factory Workers Disturbed, Accept Cigarettes</p>
<p>[Our Dispatch] At 2:30 p.m. yesterday, the Jin Hua Cigarette Company at 133 Julu Road experienced a disturbance when workers demanded an adjustment to their wages to be paid in rice. The Lujiabang Police Sub-bureau and the Flying Fort learned of the incident and immediately dispatched police officers to suppress the disturbance and urged representatives from both sides to continue open discussions. As a result, the company agreed to issue each worker 12 cartons of cigarettes, which resolved the issue satisfactorily.</p>

<p>Tight Credit, Shortage of Cash</p>
<p>Unprecedented Number of Bounced Checks</p>
<p>Banks Restrict Customer Withdrawals</p>
<p>Yesterday, credit remained tight, and the shortage of cash worsened. Not only commercial banks felt the threat, but also national banks and bureaus found it difficult to manage their finances. It was especially inconvenient for branches of banks and bureaus outside of Shanghai to transfer funds. Responsible parties stated that the reasons for the cash shortage were: firstly, rising prices; secondly, merchants carrying cash to purchase goods in other cities; and most importantly, the limit of 2 billion on the amount of currency issued. The tight credit in recent days has caused many industrial and commercial enterprises to experience financial difficulties. The number of bounced checks is unprecedented, leading to frequent disputes over interbank lending. Those who have cash are very cautious about lending it out.</p>
<p>The financial market in this city has recently experienced unprecedentedly serious phenomena: one is a shortage of cash, and the other is extremely tight credit. Due to the shortage of cash, the discount for every thousand yuan reached as high as 200 yuan. Due to the extremely tight credit, the daily interest rate for interbank lending reached a peak of 170 yuan per thousand, and a daily interest rate of 100 yuan was very common. The Central Bank has decided to provide as much convenience as possible for the payment of interbank deposits, without any strict regulations, and to determine the payment standard based on the amount of funds available. National banks and bureaus have slightly restricted withdrawals of deposits since the 10th, tentatively setting a limit of 600,000 yuan per institution. Commercial banks and bureaus have a temporary limit of 200,000 yuan, and national banks and bureaus and commercial banks and bureaus limit cash withdrawals for general customers to 300 yuan per household. Under these circumstances, it is of course difficult to cope. National banks and bureaus and commercial banks and bureaus have begun to issue cashier's checks. As a result, the number of checks has increased sharply, and commercial banks and bureaus have implemented austerity measures, including stopping lending and refusing overdrafts, to prevent accidents. According to the person in charge of the Bankers Association who spoke to the reporter, the current phenomenon of cash shortage and tight credit is due to soaring prices and increased currency circulation speed. At present, the open prices have risen more than ten times above the restricted prices. Although prices are being forced to plummet now, it is hoped that the government can seize the opportunity to find a way to stabilize them. Without special factors, price stability should not be a problem.</p>
<p>Adjustment of Domestic Exchange Rates</p>
<p>The Central Bank's exchange rates for remittances to various places are tentatively changed from tomorrow (13th). The exchange rate for remittances to Changsha, Hengyang, Yuanling, Hankou, Chongqing, Chengdu, Wanxian, Zigong, Xuzhou, Pingjin, Qingdao, Nanchang, Ji'an, Wuhu, Kunming, Baoji, Tianshui, Ya'an, Kangding, Guiyang and other places will be changed to 20 yuan per thousand yuan, and Ningbo will be changed to 10 yuan per thousand yuan, while other places will remain unchanged.</p>
<p>Par Value of State-Owned Enterprise Stocks to Be Adjusted Soon</p>
<p>[Our Dispatch] After the sale of state-owned enterprise stocks was suspended, the relevant authorities will re-evaluate all enterprises that have issued stocks, and the par value will also be adjusted before sales are resumed. It is reported that the main reason for the suspension of sales is that the prices of all goods are expensive, while the prices of state-owned enterprise stocks are low, especially the stocks of Taiwan Sugar Corporation. Due to the adjustment of the exchange rate between the Taiwan dollar and the gold yuan, the price has fallen threefold in effect. If the par value is not increased, it will also cause a buying spree.</p>
<p>Scarce Cotton Yarn Transactions</p>
<p>The yarn market is still weak due to tight credit and weak demand from all parties. As today (12th) is Sun Yat-sen's birthday and the market is closed, transactions had to be settled on the same day, so the market was slightly active at the close. The opening price of 42-count Blue Phoenix yarn was 8,500 yuan, but due to active spot settlements, transactions were scarce and the price once fell to 7,800 yuan. It then followed the cloth market and recovered to 8,000 yuan at the close, a slight decrease of 500 yuan from the previous day. The closing price of 21-count Double Horse yarn was 5,000 yuan, 32-count Silver Moon yarn was 6,500 yuan, 20-count Jincheng yarn was 4,800 yuan, 16-count Guangming yarn was 4,800 yuan, and 10-count Boy Scout yarn was 3,500 yuan (all for same-day delivery). The market atmosphere throughout the day was initially weak but then stabilized. The arbitrage market was as follows: 42-count Blue Phoenix 1,500 yuan, 21-count Double Horse 1,000 yuan, 20-count Jincheng 1,000 yuan, all for one-day term.</p>
<p>In addition, the announced price of cotton yarn allocated by the Textile Construction Company on the 10th was 5,000 yuan for 20-count Tianguan yarn, 3,000 yuan for 8-count Riguang yarn, 3,300 yuan for 10-count Lima yarn, 7,000 yuan for 40-count Riguang yarn, and 7,000 yuan for 40-count Red Treasure Light yarn.</p>
<p>Cotton Cloth Retail Stores Resume Business</p>
<p>Due to tight credit in the cotton cloth market, retail stores have resumed business in order to obtain cash. However, the purchasing power of citizens is weak. The asking price outside the market for 12-pound Dragon Head fine cloth was 240-250 yuan. Tianjin merchants and platform merchants competed for purchases, and the price gradually rose. Around 11:00 a.m., the price once reached as high as around 300 yuan. However, due to selling at high prices, the price fell back to 270 yuan near noon, an increase of 20 yuan compared to the previous day. Four Gentlemen serge had clear transactions due to the Textile Construction Company's allocation, and the price was in line with Dragon Head fine cloth.</p>
<p>[Our Dispatch] The China Textile Construction Company quoted and sold cotton cloth yesterday as usual. A total of six types of cotton cloth and three types of American-Mexican cloth were offered. The quoted prices were 285 yuan for Four Gentlemen Yuanzhigong, 160 yuan for Jumping Carp Gray Twill, 300 yuan for Jumping Carp Jingyuan Direct Buy, 200 yuan for Deputy Brand 29.5-yard Serge Fabric and 5 B 12-pound fine cloth, and 195 yuan for Dragon Head 12-pound fine cloth. As a result, a total of 4,400 bolts were sold, with a total of 143 purchase orders, including 8 orders from manufacturers for 880 bolts and 135 orders from cloth shops for 3,520 bolts, totaling 536,000 yuan.</p>
<p>In addition, the company also quoted and sold four types of woolen fabrics yesterday, but because the quoted prices were too low, no sales were made.</p>
<p>Cotton Yarn and Cloth Markets to Reopen</p>
<p>Membership Cards to Be Replaced Starting Today</p>
<p>The cotton yarn and cloth markets in this city were ordered to suspend business during the price restriction period. After the price restrictions were lifted, all goods were freely bought and sold. The two yarn and cloth markets applied to the Social Affairs Bureau for permission to resume free trading. According to a reporter, the Social Affairs Bureau has approved the two markets to resume free market trading. The two markets are processing the replacement of the membership cards of all members today and tomorrow, and all will be completed tomorrow. The cotton yarn market is scheduled to resume market trading starting next week. The cotton cloth market will also resume market trading starting on Monday or Tuesday next week.</p>
<p>Rice Market Returns to Normal</p>
<p>Bai Geng Sold at 700 Yuan</p>
<p>Yesterday's rice trading saw market activity and the trend has returned to normal. A total of 25 shi were traded, with Bai Geng priced at 700 yuan, early rice at 600 yuan, Bai Yuan at 700 yuan, and rough Geng at 650 yuan, the price being level with the previous day. The arrival of goods to the market was still scarce. 635 shi were registered to have arrived at the South Market, and trading at the North Market was stagnant due to the lack of rice source, presenting a situation of scarce arrivals and sales. Yesterday, off-market trading of rice also plummeted.</p>
<p>In addition, in order to dredge rice sources and stabilize the people's livelihood, Mayor Wu ordered rice industry merchants and distributors to purchase 20 dan of rice per unit per day starting on the 14th of this month for the city's food supply. Those who violate this will have their food department licenses revoked and ordered to suspend business.</p>
<p>Flour, Food Oil, and Miscellaneous Grains All Fall</p>
<p>The flour market saw large-scale trading yesterday, with prices plummeting, falling more than 60% from the peak price of 400 yuan per bag. Bingshipai opened at 165 yuan, and briefly rose to 170 yuan in between, but closed at the original level. Dafadengta was 180 yuan, Lan Jiancheng was 150 yuan, Maigen was 180 yuan, and Fuxin bran was 120 yuan.</p>
<p>In the food oil market, due to tight credit and a hidden interest rate of one yuan, most sold to obtain cash, and the market was oversupplied. The local bean oil opened at 900 yuan, but the market fell to 850 yuan at the close. Raw oil remained at the original level, sesame oil saw no transactions, and vegetable oil was 700 yuan, which was 140 yuan lower than yesterday. Cooked vegetable oil also fell by 100 yuan, and the lack of cash caused a wave of bounced checks.</p>
<p>The price of miscellaneous grains also fell sharply, with yellow soybeans falling by 30 yuan and corn falling by 10 yuan. Other goods were also oversupplied.</p>
<p>Market Price List</p>
<p>The Economic Climate of Hunan, Jiangxi, and Guangdong on November 11th</p>
<p>By Our Reporter Mao Shukui</p>
<p>[Our Dispatch] In late October, the price restriction policy was still effective in Shanghai, but in Jiangxi, Hunan, and Guangdong, it had long been replaced by "negotiated prices" and "free trade." We arrived in Nanchang on October 23rd, where a case involving prices was circulating. It is said that a training director of a local middle school purchased a suit from a tailor shop, agreeing on a total cost of 120 yuan for labor and materials. The shopkeeper requested payment in full at once. After repeated consultations, both parties agreed to pay half first, and the remaining half would be paid when the clothes were picked up five days later.</p>
<p>A Custom-Made Suit Generates Endless Twists and Turns</p>
<p>The training director did not pick up the clothes until the seventh day, delaying for two days. During these two days, prices rose by 40%. The shopkeeper demanded compensation for the loss of 60 yuan, plus an additional 20 yuan. The customer knew he was in the wrong and agreed, paying 60 yuan to take back a pair of pants first, stating that he would prepare another 20 yuan the next day to pick up the coat. The unexpected expense really troubled him. With great difficulty, he managed to gather the money on the third day to pick up the coat, but the shopkeeper reneged because prices had risen even more during these two days. He insisted on adding another 20 yuan before giving him the coat. This angered the training director. He went back and gathered more than a dozen students, forcibly taking the clothes. The matter was brought to the police station, with one side accusing him of using violent means to rob property, and the other side accusing him of violating price restrictions... I only stayed in Nanchang for one night, and did not have the opportunity to verify the truth of this incident or find out what happened next. However, we can get a glimpse of the price fluctuations in Nanchang from this case.</p>
<p>Gold and Silver Dollar Redemption Has Little Effect in Hunan and Jiangxi</p>
<p>The new economic measures of redeeming gold and silver dollars did not have much effect in Jiangxi and Hunan. The common people still refused to give up prices based on silver dollars. Farmers still insisted on selling one zu of rice for ten yuan. The Changsha Central Daily News once published a very frank news item about the black market for gold and silver: "There is no gold trading in gold shops, and silver dollars have disappeared from the market. However, transactions are still being conducted underground very secretly. It secretly guides the rise and fall of prices and stubbornly occupies people's hearts." The social environment and political organization could not strictly enforce the "August 19" price restrictions here, so the local government could only adopt more peaceful "negotiated prices" and "persuasion" to allow prices to find a suitable level in the relationship between supply and demand.</p>
<p>The Black Market Prices in Hong Kong and Macau React Very Quickly</p>
<p>Prices in Guangzhou once experienced chaos. This was caused by the exchange rates for gold, silver, and foreign currencies set by the government when reforming the monetary system. Chairman Song Ziwen also pointed out: Hong Kong and Macau are too close to Guangzhou, and prices react extremely quickly to the black market for Hong Kong dollars. Therefore, all kinds of rigid price restrictions do not work here. When the reporter arrived in Guangzhou on October 27, he found that the average price in Guangzhou was about three times higher than the "August 19" price restriction in Shanghai, but strange phenomena such as "panic buying" and "goods with prices but no stock" never appeared in Guangzhou.</p>
<p>The Stimulation of Prices Is Not as Strong as in Shanghai</p>
<p>In terms of the economic climate, Jiangxi, Hunan, and Guangdong are one season ahead of Shanghai. When Shanghainese were queuing up to buy price-restricted goods, the black market prices there had already been recognized by the government. Therefore, the news of the lifting of price restrictions did not stimulate prices as quickly as in Shanghai. Now we are struggling in the cold wind, but perhaps we can still find some signs of spring in Guangdong.</p>
<p>Xie Youmin and Others Suspected of Corruption, Detained in Court and Publicly Prosecuted</p>
<p>[Our Dispatch] Xie Shimin, former secretary-general of the Shanghai County Party Committee and current senator and chairman of the Zigang Township Cooperative, and Xie Yaoquan, former mayor of Zigang Township and business director of the cooperative, were deemed to have committed a serious crime in the bean cake loan and corruption case. The Shanghai District Prosecutor's Office detained them in court during the fourth hearing on the 8th and will soon file a public prosecution.</p>
<p>Jiaxing Organizes Patrol Teams</p>
<p>[Our Jiaxing Dispatch on the 11th] As winter defense approaches, the Self-Defense Headquarters, the Police Bureau, and the Standing Self-Defense Squadron of the City Center Police Station have been ordered to jointly organize patrol teams. From the 10th, patrols will be conducted from 12:00 p.m. to 6:00 a.m. the next day, dividing the area into sections to maintain security. Also, as the winter defense period approaches, the wooden bridges on all roads have begun to be repaired urgently, with a deadline for completion in mid-month.</p>
<p>The Coalfield of Bagong Mountain</p>
<p>By Our Reporter Dou Baiping</p>
<p>[Our Tianji'an Dispatch on the 7th] Bagong Mountain is located in the southwest of the 1,000-square-kilometer Huainan Basin. For many years, it was just a barren land with some traces left in history, where the so-called Eight Dukes of the Han Dynasty went to visit Prince An of Huainan, and where Xie Xuan used the grass and trees on the mountain to scare away Qin King Fu Jian in the Battle of Feishui of the Jin Dynasty. Today, Bagong Mountain is worth ten times its value. It will be one of the largest coal mines in Central China. In terms of the journey of national construction, this is truly great news.</p>
<p>Mechanized</p>
<p>Development Engineering</p>
<p>The reporter traveled from Jiunenggang to Tianji'an and then to Bagong Mountain. Steel and cement poles for high-voltage power transmission lines lined the road, with vast wheat fields on both sides. At the end of the road, climbing up the high slope, the mine buildings were built on a small hill. Walking into the gate, there was a towering steam furnace chimney. The mine houses with white tops and red walls were pleasing to the eye. This is just the beginning. The plan is to fully adopt mechanization, and all measures are based on the "century-long plan." The development project plans to divide the coal seams into upper and lower groups. The upper group will mine the upper five coal seams, and the lower group will mine the lowest two coal seams. The upper group will open two inclined shafts, one of which will be equipped with a non-polar belt conveyor. The non-polar belt has only been used in the United States for nearly 20 years. It is expected that after the installation, the daily output of coal will be 7,000 tons. The other one is dedicated to transporting materials and personnel up and down. Another air shaft will be opened, equipped with a slurry-type fan, with an air volume of 90,000 cubic meters per minute and a wind pressure of 4.5 inches. The lower group will also open two inclined shafts, also equipped with non-polar belt conveyors. The estimated daily output is 3,000 tons, achieving the goal of producing 10,000 tons of coal per day.</p>
<p>10,000 Tons</p>
<p>Production Ideal</p>
<p>Currently, the first and second inclined shafts are 122 meters deep and are both located in the upper coal seam. The inclined shafts and winches are temporary equipment and still have the nature of exploration. The third inclined shaft is 3.5 meters high and 5.5 meters wide and is located in the lower coal seam. Construction only started in September. A production volume of 10,000 tons is currently just an ideal. It needs to solve several problems first. Firstly, the area surrounding Bagong Mountain is surrounded by local communists. Wei Fenglou's Longshan troops also occasionally intrude. On the 22nd of last month, the Longshan troops occupied Fengtai, located on the north bank of the Huai River, 30 miles from the mine, causing panic in the mine. Fortunately, it was recovered, and things stabilized again. In today's situation, a great deal of effort is put into security.</p>
<p>Production, Sales, and Transportation</p>
<p>Three in One</p>
<p>Secondly, production, sales, and transportation are interconnected. A production volume of 10,000 tons must have equal transportation capacity. Currently, the mine has a narrow-gauge railway connected to the Huai River, using several steamships for transportation. The maximum transportation volume does not exceed 1,000 tons, which is clearly not enough. The Huainan Railway to Yuxi is still awaiting funding. Thirdly, coal mining requires the large-scale use of machinery. Without money, nothing can be said. Even the 3.5 million US dollar loan that has already been decided will all be used to import machinery and equipment. However, according to Director Wang Dezhi, if these things really arrive, it is estimated that it will take twice the amount of the US loan to arrange for installation. Indeed, the beautiful prospects of this coalfield can only be supported by funding.</p>

<h3>The First Half of This Month's Cost of Living Index Compiled Based on Market Prices</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Wu Kaixian, Director of the Social Affairs Bureau, stated yesterday that the cost of living index for the first half of November has been finalized and will be released on the 15th. The method of salary payment for workers in all industries will follow the old practice, calculated by multiplying the base salary in Gold Yuan by the cost of living index. Discounts will still be applied as usual. For those who typically pay salaries based on the previous period's index, an approximate value of the previous period's index will also be released to facilitate calculation. The index is compiled using the August 19th prices as the base period. The distribution of daily necessities to workers, originally scheduled to begin in November, has been delayed due to the distribution certificates still being printed. Workers have not yet received the distributed goods, so the compilation of the index for the first half of November is based on market prices and not on distributed prices. The General Labor Union's request to expand the scope of distribution to include soap, cigarettes, etc., is being considered. Director Wu also stated that the authorities have considered the issue of where a large amount of floating capital will go after the cost of living index is released and salaries are paid in each industry.

<h3>General Assembly of the Federation of Industries Requests to Move to Shanghai; Shanghai Representatives Unanimously Resolve</h3>

<h3>Teachers from Various Schools Petition; Rice Rations for Private Schools Scheduled; City Schools Request Reply</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] In recent days, prices have soared, and teachers in private schools are facing serious threats to their livelihoods and are in urgent need of assistance. The Shanghai Private Primary and Secondary Schools Joint Association held a board meeting on the 8th. After detailed discussion, more than ten representatives were elected to meet with Mayor Wu yesterday morning and propose two requests: (1) November rice rations should be distributed immediately; (2) A subsidy of 500 yuan per teacher should be issued. Mayor Wu expressed deep sympathy and promised to notify the Civil Affairs Committee to issue rice rations immediately. However, he stated that the subsidy could not be paid due to the city treasury's shortage. He agreed that each school could collect fees from students' parents to provide emergency assistance. The representatives also visited Director Lu and Section Chief Xu of the Civil Affairs Committee at 11:00 AM. As a result of the negotiations, it was agreed that the special rice rations for secondary schools in November would be distributed within the next week, and the rice rations for primary schools would be distributed starting on the 21st. The association will hold another meeting at No. 553 Zhongzheng Middle Road tomorrow afternoon.</p>

The mayor gave them spiritual comfort and promised to resolve everything within days. At 3:00 PM in the afternoon, they continued to discuss the matter at Gezhi Middle School and resolved to submit an emergency relief request to the authorities, asking the mayor to provide a concrete response on the morning of the 13th. If a satisfactory result is not obtained, members of each school will take seven days of leave from the school authorities starting on the 15th. If the livelihood problem still cannot be resolved after the leave, a general assembly of all members will be convened to discuss ways to survive.</p>
