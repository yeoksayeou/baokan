<p>調整文武職待遇　鹽關等稅決增加</p>
<p>文武職人員待遇調整辦法如次：（一）文武職人員待遇，自四月份起按月調整。（二）每月生活補助費支給標準，按上月份生活指數分區核定，公費生及士兵副秣等費，比照調整。在未　齊上月份指數分區核定標準以前，每月暫照上月生活補助費先行發給，俟核定標準後，須於當月內清算後補足數（四月份生活補助費暫照以前標準加倍發給，仍於核定分區指數標準後清算增撥）（三）工役生活補助費平均數改爲十五元。（四）各文武機關員工生活補助費，仍應繼續減發，惟為減少執行困難，改爲四至六月共再减發百分之五七，至十二月共減發百分之十。同時通過因調整待遇增籌歲收辦法如次：甲·食臨每担加十萬元，連同現征稅收每担卅五萬元，共征四十五萬元。土　　每担加八萬元，連伺現征每担廿萬元，共征廿八萬元。漁農　每担加四萬元，連同現征十萬元，共征十四萬元，計　稅半年可增收八千萬餘億元。乙·棉紗稅率即時調整為百分之十（原為百分之七）計半年可得八千億元，其餘尙有海關稅之調整等等，</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕紐約廿六日廣播：華盛頓訊，參院外委會廿六日向參院提出報吿稱：該委會所建議之四億六千三百萬美元援華計劃，旨在給於該國以「努力進行自助計劃」之機會，該項援助計劃，分十二個月進仃，參院之辯論，將於下星期三開始。該報吿實同援助中國之見解，惟謂「在現行情形下，不能擬具一依賴美國援助之切實有效之中國長期經濟　與計劃，吾人不能祖保中國之命運」。該報吿並謂：美國一不　處於負責指導中國政府及其政治·經濟·軍事事務之地位。援助計劃之宗旨，乃在應付中國對有千最重要商品之需要，以减輕中國受苦人民之痛苦以及抑制中國經濟情形之惡化，並使中國政府得再獲一努力進行自助計劃之機會」。</p>
<p>〔中央社華盛頓廿五日電〕際茲衆院援外計劃之一般性辯論已近結束之時，衆院中已可發現美穌冷戰日趨緊張之跡象。美共和　衆議員洛洪力主美國應與馬歇爾可劃內之歐洲十六國及中國締定多邊軍事協定，但防止各該國　內外之共黨侵凌。渠並主張管制輸出，俾禁止以軍火，飛機，引擎及其他可供軍用之器材運往蘇聯及其附席國。</p>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓廿六日電〕共　黨參議員勃里奇稱，將在參院討論援華法案時，設法擴大其軍事方面之援助。援華經費總數仍爲四億六千三百萬元，但將建議削减經濟援助三億六千三百萬元至三億一千三百萬元，並取消一億元軍事贈款之規定，另以一億五千萬元在軍事上援助中國，其贈予辦法由杜魯門總統決定。此種軍事援助，除非出於中國申請，不得給與，且美軍不得用于與援助有關之作戰任務。</p>

<p>潯指揮部結束說不確</p>
<p>〔本報漢口廿六日電〕潯指揮部某高級官員鄭重宣稱：關於華中軍事機構如何變更之各種傳說，係因華中綏靖會議未曾發佈新聞所引起之揣測；實則此間剿呃機構兩月內當不致改變。綏靖會議雖曾就設立綏靖公署作原則上之決定，但迄今尙未具體化。至白部長此來，係視察並加强大別山區剿呃軍事，外傳指揮部將辦理結束說並屬無稽之談。</p>

<p>〔本報南京廿六日電〕第一届國民代表大會，將於廿九日開幕，不致延期，籌委會秘書長洪蘭友，廿六日於記者招待會中答覆記者詢問時宣稱：「截至今日止，籌委會並未接到大會延期開幕之命令，據本人所知，政府亦絕未考慮大會延期開幕」。洪氏旋就法律觀點加以解釋，渠稱：憲法實施準備程序第八條規定，依憲法產生之國大代表，已選出達總額三分之二時，得爲合法之集會及召集；至報到到者人數達選出數若干倍，始能開幕，法無明文規定，照一般慣例，應爲半數以上。依照洪氏之解釋，現在國大召集爲台法，選出之代表總額共二八三二人，如報到代表達一四一七人，當可如期開幕，以廿六日報到情形及在來京途中之代表人數視之，廿九日前夕報到者達一四一七人殆無問題，故國大可能如期開幕；惟開幕後是否即可開議及選舉總統·副總統，修改憲法，則尙有待·據洪蘭友之解釋，國大組織法第八條規定，國民大會非有代表過半數之出席不得開議，總統·副總統選罷法中規定，總統·副總統應得代表總額渦半數之票數爲當選。又憲法第一七四條規定，憲法之修改，應由國代總額五分之一提議，三分之二之出席及出席代表四分之三之決議，得修改之。依此解釋，本届大會須出席者達一五二三人始能開議，須出席者達一五二三人始能選舉總統·副總統，至修改憲法，至少須出席代表達二〇三〇人以上，始能制定修改之決議。依目前情形估計大會可能於廿九日開幕後，候代表達一五二三人以上，始正式開議，並選舉總統·副總統，而本届大會可能不致修改憲法，故二〇三〇之人數限制，可能無甚影響。（下接二版五欄）</p>

<p>〔本報北平六日電〕華北剿總發言人廿五日在平行轅記者招待會上宣稱：晋北察南戰局，廿五日起已由主動撤守轉爲主動殲滅，惟全盤戰局尙未到決定階段，國軍正覓取大團殲良機。聶榮臻·姚喆本企圖以其六七萬兵力，破壞平綏鐵路後，一舉攻下張垣，但自十九日起，一週來之戰局，發現其此種企圖已被粉碎，察省地方軍政組織向甚有力，故若干據點雖放棄而仍可掌握全面，民衆已奮起自衛，僅張垣即有二萬三千餘人組成自衛隊，戰鬥重心現在　鎮以東，廠漢營殘匪已退，共匪主力現在桑乾河兩岸地區。</p>

<h3 id="c16">制憲人要作行憲人　孫副主席早戀單選副總統 <a href="#c16" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e16" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">16</a></h3>
<p>副主席孫科用以作爲競選副總統的最主要條件之一，是：「中華民國憲法，經本人手創；其後雖一再修改，但均躬親其事。我對這部憲法，每一章每一條都非常熟悉，非常瞭解，在總統推行這部憲法時，我有自信，能擔當此實，協助總統推行憲法」。這一個條件，可以說是最有力量的條件，以制憲者而爲行憲者，不是最好的條件嗎？在孫氏本人，他辛苦了十六年，從有一個理想開始，到看到這一部憲法誕生，他付予了相當的代價。可是，這僅是制憲形式上的成就。對於他，究竟這一部憲法實施的成果如何，是更重要的，而且更能體驗他的成就是不是僅僅止於「形式上」。</p>
<p>孫氏競選副總統，還有一個巧合：他的現職是副主席，就相等於行憲後的副總統職。孫氏出任副主席是協助蔣主席推行政令，而未來的總統，雖然蔣主席並沒有宣佈他將要競選，但事實已經很顯然，不至有別人去競選，因此，孫氏競選副總統，將仍以協助蔣總統推行憲法。這一個巧合，幾乎成爲孫氏的當然候選人條件之一。</p>
<p>孫氏儘管有這些特點，有這些拘負，可是他的參加鼓選，並沒有很早就正式宣布參加。直到他公開宣布參加競選的前一天下午，記者在孫氏的會客室裏，享有了第一個聽到從他自己嘴裏吐出來他將決定參加競選的消息　孫氏顯然是一位很爽朗的政治家當他一聽到記者向他探詢競選的消息時，他立即從旁答覆他已定期招待記者了。他和記者條理分明的說出他爲什麽參加競選以及他對於國事的興趣等等。並且解釋他競選副總統和未來立法院院長之職權的不衝突。他視中華民國的憲法爲他的寵兒，他以那麽熱忱的情感來愛護他，培養他的成長。同時他更需要看到他的發揚光大。在他的語氣裏，是那麽堅定，有力：「我自信我懂得民主政治，我自信憲法條文的眞義眞諦。「由華民國第一届總統的任務就是切切實實的推行憲法嚴守憲法，我有此資格，來協助總統推行」。他對於世界問題的認識和瞭解，亦有獨到的見解，決心參與解決這些問題而當仁不讓。</p>
<p>他對中國當前問題的看法有兩點：一個　國間題，另一個是民生問題。他說我們十年前的抗戰，現在的戡亂都爲的是建立三民主義的新國家，而應列爲首要的，是應該根據民權主義建立一個確確實實的民主國民主社會，而達成民主政治。至於後者尤爲當前急待解決的。尤其需要政治上有地位，有責任，有見地的人，更應集中力量，下最大的決心來實行民生主義，以解決民生間題。　記者訪問時，曾經要求職取他的政見與外交政策。但是在他正思考了幾分鐘時，坐在一旁的他的夫人提醒他說話太多了，似乎唯恐把需要　記者招待會中發表的談話都說盡了，於是這一次訪問，就僅止於此。</p>
<p>孫氏的競選空氣，一經揭開，助選的機構立刻成立了。在廿五日下午他公布參加競選的記者招待會，像羣星拱月似的。招待會在首都華僑招待所大禮堂舉行，到達的記者有好幾百人，曾經有不少熟烈的詢問，孫氏都輕淡的答覆了，而且很引起詢間者的滿意。比如說對於副總統能不一能兼任立法院院長的問題，他就說這個問題還沒有發生，如果說到那時大總統因事不能視事而由立院院長代行職權或乃至竟不能再回到立院之職時，那麼立法院還有副院長。再說，立法院亦可重新選舉院長。反之，如果這種代行職權爲期很暫，那麽對於立院長一職並無妨碍，因爲他說立院是民主的機構，立院的決定權是在立委而不在院長，副總統也是毫無實權的，因此在平時，這不是個相衝突的問題。有人說：「假如蔣主席竟不參加競選總統呢你是不是改換競選總統」？他說：「到那時再說吧」！</p>
<p>孫氏的競選組織，建立在他十餘年主持的立法院立法委員們身上，因此有人問他選舉的經綱時，他笑說：「我將尊重國大代表神聖的一票，我決不花一文錢」。</p>
<p>一個很熱烈的招待會，充滿了立法院的空氣—因爲在主席座次的是孫院長夫人坐在他的一旁。雜坐在記者羣裏的，是不少立法委員。但是掃除了　　，是　　的開始和結果。（三月廿五日目京寄）</p>

<h3 id="c17">調整公教人員待遇 <a href="#c17" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e17" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">17</a></h3>
<p>關於全國公敎人員待遇調整問題，本月廿三日行政院政務會議曾決定五項原則：業經昨日國務會議例會通過。此五項原則是：（一）自四月份起按上月生活指數每月調整一次，中央及各省市文武職人員補助費，本年上半年度不敷數，於特別預算調整時一次追加；（二）生活指數差額過鉅，分區數加多，另擬救濟辦法：（三）副食馬乾公費生均照比例調整；（四）公役月薪底薪自十三元平均數增至十五元平均數；（五）各機關酌量裁减員工。京滬平津配購辦法緩議。當一般物價漫無限制的狂奔猛漲，公敎人員生活水準日趨下沉的今天，政府不顧財政的困難，決定全般調整待遇，原則是可貴的，意義是重大的。</p>
<p>現在的時代，是中間階級特別是知識份子，沒落沉淪的時代。中間階級和多數知識份子，寄生於公敎人羣，把他們的生活與前途，信仰和抱負，依存在這職業事業上面。由於物價的狂漲，生活負擔的增加，社會的憎惡，時代的嘲笑，環境的欺騙，公敎人員的地位是日趨低落了，雖然政府亦曾顧到公敎人員的生活，規定每隔三月調整待遇一次，但是永遠趕不上物價，致形成越調越苦的局面；尤其在配給食米取銷之後，工作報酬與牛活負擔變成剪刀形之差，公敎人員更陷於困苦的邊綠上了。上海市財政局職員陸濠因了愛妻重病，債台高築，而投浦自殺，接着他的妻子顧頻也繼之病歿，這是一慕慘　人寰的悲劇。常熟地方法院員工半日辦公，半日叫賣香烟花生瓜子於街頭，以其非薄的利潤，聊資生活挹注，這是一幕「和平反抗」（甘地精神）的寫照。同樣的事情，同情的遭遇，充滿了人間，這是何等不合理的危險現象啊！</p>
<p>一個開明的進步的政府，是不能放棄「養士」和「尊士」的，否則國家的楝樑盡失，還成什麽局面？國府監察院爲此，建議「恢復公敎人員實物配給辦法，並將待遇按生活指數每月調整一次」；立法院更進一步，建議「政府對文武職人員的待遇，改爲每月按生活指數調整一次，並配給食米，提高技工及工友薪餉，詳定裁員善後辦法」。這兩項建議，都是救濟公敎人員生活現狀的善良對策，　蔣主席非常車視，國務會議曾數度討論，以爲國庫收支固應顧到，而公敎人員問題亦應注意，二者不得兩全，當然祗有捨前者而顧後者，纔算符合國家養士的精神。這次行政院通過的原則，除「配給食米」未作決定，和「裁員」酌予辦理外，整個採取了立監兩院的建議，特別注重生活指數的每月調整。以目前經濟趨勢說，待遇按月照生活指數調整，乃爲必然之勢，至本月份待遇按照上月之生活指數發給，是否與實際情形符合，是値得主計機關擬具詳細辦法時，要特別愼重注意的。</p>
<p>依主計機關的慣例和國庫的負擔來說，公敎人員待遇每月按照生活指數調整，當是一件可驚的支出；可是，這是追不獲已，情况使然的支出，無論如何艱困，也要實行的。據最近估計，公敎人員待遇在元月份調整時，每月約增支三萬零二百十七億八千萬；以近月生活指數的變動，恐逐月增加百分之四十左右，以此推算國庫的負擔，二月份約四萬二千億，三月份約爲五萬八千八百億，四月份約爲八萬二千三百二十億，五月份約爲十一萬五千二百四十八億，六月份約爲十六萬一千三百四十七億；在這半年內約共增加四十八萬九千七百五十億。這當然是一樁可驚的支出。倘物價無法穩定，這累積的增加只有愈來愈大。因此我們建議政府，在增加公敎人員待遇的同時，財政上應設法增稅，發債，變賣敵偽物資，與爭取賠償，出售國營事業，藉以增加國庫的收入，打開財政上的難關。</p>
<p>總之，公敎人員待遇的調整，政府現在已作最大的努力，政府已對公敎人員　其神聖的義務。我們贊同此一比較賢明的措施。同時，我們也希望全國文武職人員，本「志士不忘在溝壑」的精神，認淸時艱，正視現實，越是時局艱難，越要精勤惕勵，這纔是公敎人員至高的榮譽，與服務社會人羣的準則。</p>

<p>〔中央社紐約三月八日航訊〕記者因見二月二十日國內京滬各報載有救濟特捐督導委員會指定富議認捐之消息，前參謀總長何應欽氏亦名列前茅，特請見何氏於其紐約軍參團中國代表團辦公室，詢對此事之感想，氏態度謙和，語意懇摯，對記者所提問題，均不憚煩瑣，一一解答，爰就問答所及，摘誌於次：</p>
<p>記者問：「最近國內救濟特捐督導委員會指名認捐之事，先生有所聞否」？</p>
<p>何氏微笑點頭答稱：「然，已見中央日報及申報矣」。</p>
<p>問：「先生被列爲五十首富之一，有何感想」？</p>
<p>答：「報載消息，尙未證實爲督導委員會之決定。據報載，督導會議決捐額審核標準第四條，將自然人家產價値與法人資產價値各區分十級，本人無財力投資於工商業，與法人資產無關，但按自然人家產價値，最高級爲五千億元以上，最低級爲五十億元以上，如將本人列爲首富，是認本人家產價値有數千億元，殊覺與事實不符？本人在國內薄有產業，然價値實屬有限，無論如何，均無資格稱爲首富」。</p>
<p>問：「聞國內有人傳說先生有大量美金存放美國，先生亦有所聞否」？</p>
<p>答：「本人在未到美國以前，絕無美金存放美國，民卅五年奉派來美後，始將政府發給之旅費及特支費餘款二萬餘元，於當年八月七日存入紐約州長島本表團前團址附近之華盛頓港地方銀行，戶頭係用本人姓名官階，此爲本人有生以來第一次在外國銀行開立戶頭，嗣後因本代表團遷入紐約城內辦公，乃在現代表團址附近之紐約銀行（花旗銀行）開立戶頭，收支情形銀行均有賬據可以查對，此外即無任何存款存於其他任何外國銀行，亦未在外國置有任何產業，且本人在戰時迭次主張由政府數用我國私人在外國存款，在本黨六全大會時，並曾作此提案，是以本人究有無大量美金，實不待辦而自明也」。</p>
<p>問：「先生認爲救濟特捐之辦法是否合理？有無成效」？</p>
<p>答：是「本人工作海外，對此事不甚明瞭，無法批評。但就原則上言，國家財政困難至此地步，國人自應曉於大義，本有有錢出錢，有力出力之原則，踴躍認捐，倘政府能以正式立法手續釐定財產稅則，實施征收，則成效或比勸募更太」。</p>
<p>問：「先生準備捐款否」？</p>
<p>答：「本人爲政府官吏之一，對認捐一事，自應首先倡導，已函請督導會照本人現有產業，據實估價，依該會所訂辦法認捐，本人並已決定變賣產業，以付此項捐款」。</p>
<p>問：「先生頃謂征收財產稅較勸募成效更大，請間先生對此問題有具體意見否」？　答：「本人對此問題早經加以考慮，原擬向七中全會提案，因大會延期，故未提出，將來或將提呈政府參考」。</p>

<h3 id="c43">美國調查團在日宣布美復興日本計劃　五年內平均每年貸欵三億至五億元　屈拉普等今飛南韓考察 <a href="#c43" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e43" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">43</a></h3>
<p>〔路透社東京廿六日電〕美陸次屈拉普今日發表現由美國會委員會在考慮中，使日本成爲「遠東工塲」之計劃，其中規定除每年撥付之三億至四億元以供防止日本之動亂及疾病者外，另行立即撥付一億八千萬元以期復興日本之經濟。屈氏及同來之美專家相信在此一計劃下，日本之經濟至一九五二或一九五三年即可自給。屈氏指出華盛頓認爲自給經濟之雞立，爲日本之首要目標，日本復興計劃係根據歐洲復興計劃問一之原則而發展，國務部及陸軍部相信爲使日本得以自給起見，在短時期內須給以相當數量的工業原料，使其業得以進展。屈氏鄭重否認此一計劃係爲針對蘇聯指出其目的：（一）在减少美國納稅人的負担；（二）在使日本得以自立，進爲民主國家。渠並指出波茨坦協定雖規定日本經濟以一九三〇—三四之水準為標準，但美國認爲將來日本自己之努力，如顯示可能提高此一水準而並不有危和平，亦未始不可增加。美國之計劃，預定在任何一年內，撥付之經濟援助款項，至多以五億八千萬元爲限，惟此項數額係遞减制，預期至一九五二或一九五三年即達到自立目標。遠東委員會主席麥考埃，於美政府將該計劃向國會提出前，已將此意吿知遠東委員會，迄今遠東委會方而尙無批評提出。屈氏繼又談及日本工業之分解計劃，認爲實施之際，應以不妨得經濟復興爲原則，渠又鄭重吿知日本人民謂，經濟復興計劃之成功，大半有賴於日人本身之自助努力，主要關鍵仍在增加生產，增產之成績，將決定日人消費之水準。屈氏繼曰：此次來日本以後，已殺現日本經濟逐步發達的許多令人鼓勵的現象，如煤斤產量已增加百分之二十，已接近年產三百萬噸之目標，稻米收集計劃已獲得充分成功。近數月來，收稅制度亦有顯著改良，此外，日政府並已規定糧食增產目標將較去年增加百分之十，然不利的方面，亦有物價水準之上漲，紙幣流通額之增加，以及世界之美元恐慌，减少輸入國之購買力等。屈氏又透露，渠等來日後，並考慮日本人口增加的經濟問題，但尙未獲有答案。最後渠表示，日本經濟復興計劃，係以使日本成爲遠東工塲爲目標，但渠不信日本經濟將危害遠東他國之經濟。</p>

<p>〔合衆社華盛頓廿五日電〕國務卿馬歇爾廿五日否認美國關於盟國爲日刦奪財產之歸還企圖避開遠東委員會。渠在新聞會議上宣佈，美國關於此項扣留於日本此項財產之分配，其對麥帥最近所作之建議，祗能援用於各盟國無異見之歸還政策部份。馬歇爾爲答覆外間批評美國政府關於歸還手續，直接向麥帥接洽一事，對新聞宣讀下列聲明：</p>
<p>「根據遠東委員會之條款，親定美國在不閒何時有緊急事件發生而此項事件又不在該委員會已定政策之範圍以內者，則可以先發出命令與盟軍總部，以待遠東委員會以後再取行動。在此種情形下（有關被刦奪財產之歸還問題）關於歸還政策之一部份，過去已有一項協議，然由於許多受到日本損害國家認爲此事十分迫切，美國認爲有予盟軍總部政策指導之必要，美國對盟軍總部所發之指令，祗包括各國無異見之歸還計劃部分，歸還政策之未經同意部分，仍在遠東委員會討論中」。同時自可靠方面獲悉，美國遠東委員會代表麥考克吿遠東委員會稱：關於處理在日被刦奪財產問題，曾經人一再請求，予麥帥以權力，處理不包括於目前遠東委員會訓令指定之若干種類被刦奪財產。麥考克解釋最近美國政府所發之臨時指令，授權麥帥有此項處置權力稱：若千此種財產，現藏於日本倉庫中者，已在逐潮損毀中。在戰時爲日本佔領及受日刦掠受到損失之國家，極爲關切歸還計劃。中·法·澳·荷代表，認爲此係一緊念事件，麥考克指出，遠東委員會於一九四六年以後，即已從事談判歸還問題。各國關於在日發現之被刦財產歸還問題，業已能獲致若干協議條款，欲將之合併於渠等政策之內，係爲附款。麥老克稱：遠東委員會十國代表曾贊同一項擴大政策，其中祇有一國代表不贊同，而其不贊同之理由，係由於該雞議遺漏一項對渠特別感興趣之條款，而非反對其同僚所贊同之擴大政策，由此亦可見意見一致之程度矣。由於該代表之意見一致，在政策決定上係屬必要，故該項擴大政策未能通過。參加罷工者百數十萬人</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕倫敦廿六日廣播：柏林訊，柏林盟國管制委員會之蘇聯代表曾於上星期六退出會談，致使管制會之前途陷入嚴重危險，惟今日蘇方已間接向美軍司令克莢將軍屈服。蘇方高級官員在政策聲明中宣佈，四强會議將繼續召開。衆信於上星期六退出會議之蘇聯索柯洛夫斯基元帥將於三月三十日重新召開管制會會議後。蘇方之聲明被認爲克萊將軍之勝利。按克萊將軍會同英法代表曾於星期二通知蘇方，謂西方三國在蘇方未召開管制會中央會議之前，不擬再行出席四强小組會。</p>
<p>〔路透社柏林廿六日電〕德境蘇聯軍政府參謀長魯坎眞柯中將頃聲明，蘇聯贊成四强管制德國制度之存續，並希望保留盟國管制委會，以執行波茨坦會議之決議。是爲蘇聯代表關於上週六退出盟管會會議，複蘇方之第一次正式聲明希望德境四强共同機構之繼續存在。但並未請求盟管會於三月三十日即下届例會之日舉行會議。（按盟國秘書處章程規定盟管會例會之舉行，須於四日前通知）明國人士僉認蘇聯實故意放棄召開盟管會會議之最後機會。</p>
<p>魯坎眞柯將軍之談話有謂，「吾人願意波茨坦會議之決議及四强共管德國之規則，予以嚴格遵行。在盟管會得以最可能迅速的行動，履行波茨坦決議的目標期間，蘇聯代表將以毎一方法支援盟管會及其各機構。但蘇聯代表完全反對利用盟管會，作爲掩飾西方佔領國片面行動的屛陣，吾人不能支持一僅具虛名，被英美法用以掩飾其在西德的分裂手段之明國管制會。査自一九四七年中期以來，盟管會所討論之各項事件，幾無一項協議成立，吾人所得結論乃爲盟管會已不復爲一立法及行政機構，而已逐漸成爲一辯論的塲所，四强管制機構之陷入僵局，應由西方盟國負全部責任。」魯坎眞柯將軍並日，蘇聯之以主席地位，於三月廿三日宣布四强聯絡委員會之無限期延期，係基技術上的理由。</p>

<h3 id="c64">英國的費邊社 <a href="#c64" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e64" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">64</a></h3>
<p>— （本耿）</p>
<p>英國現在由工黨執政，工黨之所以能够有今日的聲望，似乎應該歸功於費邊社（Fabian　Society）與工會（Trade　Union）這兩個組織。本文的目的，在於將費邊社作一簡單的介紹。</p>
<p>（一）</p>
<p>費邊社成立於一八八四年，最初的發起者爲大衛森。波摩爾·柏士等人，後來蕭伯訥韋勃等相繼參加，它的目的在於十改造社會。至於爲什麼呌做費邊社，據說是採用羅馬一位將軍的姓氏。紀元前三百年左右，羅馬有一家族，姓費邊（Fabius），出了許多名人，在紀元前二百多年時出了一位將軍，呌做Quintus　Fabius　Maximus。這位將軍在其對漠尼比（Hannibal）戰中，以謹愼戰術著稱。費邊社之「費邊」即由這位將軍姓氏變化而來。一八八九年，費邊社出版了一本「費邊論集」由蕭伯訥·韋勃·比森。華拉士等人執筆，這本書說明他們的見解，同時也使費邊社受到各方面的注意。自是以後陸續的出版了二百多種的論著，分別討論各種問題。</p>
<p>當費邊社成立的時候，英國並沒有工黨，到了一八九三年英國才有獨立工黨。一九〇〇年英國才有現在的工黨。不過當時英國除了費邊社以外，還有兩個組織，也是以社會主義相號召的，一個是社會民主同盟，一個是社會主義者同盟，但是這兩個團體的見解，大致是急進的，而與費邊社異趣。</p>
<p>（二）</p>
<p>費邊社的主張，大致說來，是主張逐漸的改造社會，希望由於普選制度與代議政府之運用，達到社會主義之實現。換言之，他們認爲由資本主義社會到社會主義社會，是一種逐漸演化的過程，而不是革命的過程。是以費邊社雖則主張社會主義，但與馬克斯主義並不相同。馬克斯認爲社會主義之實現，由於無產階級革命，無產階級革命乃資本主義社會內在矛盾的結果。在這個理論之下，無產階級的生活愈苦，則革命的時機愈爲純熟。但是費邊社的人們，認爲自十九世紀以來之各種社會改革，例如工廠法。鑛業法等等，都表示在資本主義社會之內，已經開始社會主義的改革。這樣，他們認爲由近代民主政治之運用，可能由代議制度以實現社會主義。</p>
<p>但是費邊社雖則有上述的主張，它自身却未能說是一個政黨。第一，根據它的章程，它的目的在於建立一個新社會，在這個新社會之中，由於公有財產制取消經濟特權，同時是要以政治的民主以達此目的。但是除此之外，他們並談不到「敎條」在費邊社所出版的書刋之中，第一頁總是聲明「這本書是代表作者個人之意見，而不是代表費邊社之集體意見。」換言之，它是一個祗求「大同」的組織，對於個人的見解，是自由主義式的。第二，費邊社之在英國，有其重要的地位，但是除了出版專刋一類文化敎育工作之外，它祇有帮助別的團體或者由其社員個人從事政治活動，、而它自身則從不參加實際政治行爲。英國獨立工黨的成立，得到它的助力，而英國工黨的產生，更是由於費邊社的幫忙。現在，很多費邊社社員都是工黨的重要人物，但是如果說費邊社附屬於工黨，或者說工黨附屬於費邊社，則又朱必全對，雖則工黨的主張，大致說來，都是淵源於費邊社的主張。費邊社於五年前，大約祇有二千多社員與十幾個地方分社，現在它大約有五千多個社員與一百多個地方分社，如果由這五年的情形來講，可以義是發展得並不慢，但是如果由費邊社的六十多年的歷史來看，也並不能說發展得快。這個原因很簡單，它是一個有政治見解而沒有政治行動的團體，同時，費邊社社員之知識水準，似乎是相當的高，社員自然不曾太多。</p>
<p>（三）</p>
<p>費邊社目前的工作，似乎是以敎育文化方面爲主。它除了時常創辦暑期學校週末學校，以及各種討論會之外，有兩個很重要的工作部門，即出版與硏究。關於出版方面，有費邊新聞，是報導費邊社狀况的刋物。有費邊季刋，是發表各種專題研究及報吿之刊物，同時亦所以供討論各種問題者。另外有「費邊短篇集」與「硏究叢書」，前者已出二百多種，後者亦已出至百餘種，不過此類刋物，篇幅常不多，亦有另外以書籍形式出版者，如羅卜生編之「公有企業」（PublicEnterprice）等書，新近尙出有「討論小册」（Discussionpam　Phlet若干種。關於硏究方面，費邊社本來有一個國內問題硏究部，一九三一年又在費邊社之外，成立了一個新費邊硏究局，與費邊社採合作的方式；發起人如艾德禮（現任英國首相）克里浦那（現任財相）道爾頓（前財相）貝文（現任外相），都是費邊社的主要分子。這個研究局於一九三九年與費邊社正式合併，他們研究的範圍很廣，特定的問題有時交一委員會研究，有時交特定會員硏究。硏究的結果，再由指定的會員批評，但是他們批評的方針，並不是着重於硏究結果之是否可以同意，而是着重於是否已由社會主義者的觀點，作充分的硏究。換言之，硏究的結果，無論發表與否，都不代表「社」而祗代表「個人」。這是爲了費邊社除了爲社會主義與民主政治而努力．是一個共同目標外，並沒有「黨的路綫」，在這樣廣泛的範圍之下，意見的出入在所不免，他們允許這種「出入」的存在。</p>
<p>（四）</p>
<p>如上所述，我們可以知道費邊社這個團體，具有兩大特點：第一，它可以說是社會主義者的集團，但是它們同時信仰民主政治。第二，它是有政治見解而又不直接參加政治行動的團體。由於第一點，他們與共黨有極大的出入，他們是反對敎條或聖經式的黨綱，也不採取嚴密的親織。在「大同」之下，允許個體的存在。由於第二點，它們雖則與工黨有密切的關係，但是沒有組織上的聯繫，他們的社員參加政治，他們的團體則存在於政治之外。這種作風，可能是因爲他們認爲社會主義幷不是一套固定的定義，而是若干原則。因爲是原則，所以必須允許討論，允許「小異」。同時他們認爲社會主義幷不是單純的政治問題，而且包括有「理論」以及社會日常的生活方式。他們這個團體，願意致力於政治以外之社會主義運動。由我們看來，費邊社多少可以說一種「新自由主義」，他們承繼有若干的舊自由主義的思想，主張民主政治尊重團體。同時由於社會的發展，使它以了解社會主義的必要。雖然他已有六十年的歷史，但是它仍然是代表着今日歐洲思想之一派，而存在於資本主義與共產主義之間。我們看今日英國工黨的政策，可以知道它對於英國的政治有甚大的影響。（一九四八·二月廿日倫敦）</p>

<p>〔合衆社成功湖廿五日電〕聯合國中僉信杜魯門呼籲巴勒斯坦阿猶休戰協定甚少或根本無成功之希望。阿刺伯人已加以拒絕，猶太人則不加詳述。然猶太某發言人稱：猶太人之立塲，已於三月十七日加以閘明，此無異說明猶太人僅贊成分治計劃也。</p>
<p>再者美國之托管計劃能否在五月十五日以前推行亦頗足懷疑，如不能則必將引用流血矣。據可靠方面表示，美國之托管計劃乃寄托於英軍有稍緩撤退之希望，甚至有報吿稱，美大使已在倫敦與英政府商討此事。</p>
<p>〔路透社成功湖廿五日電〕安理會人士頃稱：杜魯門總統之無條件支持建立巴勒斯坦托管制度，及渠之要求猶阿西族休戰，已使聯大特別會之召開成爲必然之事。惟彼等又指出，唯一能使聯大變更其分治決議之因素，當爲美國之保證，願於必要時以美國軍隊執行托管制度。</p>
<p>〔路透社成功湖二十五日電〕聯合國秘醫長賴伊今日在記者招待會上，承認聯合國機構已喪失一大部份之聲譽，其咎大部份在於五强。蓋聯合國原係以五强得以合作爲基礎，故五强自應盡力覓取合作的方法也。賴氏並謂：美國主張在巴勒斯坦設托管制，對渠完全出於意料之外。聯合國巴勒斯坦委會之秘書處人員已抵聖地，與英當局及猶人均已樹立良好合作，惟阿刺伯則堅持其立塲，完全不顧聯合國委會之工作</p>

<p>（一）本市爲使區保辦理兵役·配給·戶政·自治以及其他急要事件，得以適合戡亂需要起見，訂定本辦法。（二）本辦法適用於戡亂時期。（三）區保辦公房屋，應由區公所或保辦公處迅行籌建，以利公務。前項建築經費之籌集，應由區公所或保辦公處擬且計劃預算及經費籌集方法，提交同級民意機構通過後，層報市政府核定之。（四）區民代表會，應由民政局督飭按期召開。保民大會，應由各該管區公所督飭經常召開。集會時，區公所並須派員出席指導，講解政令，以加强市民對政府各項設施之認識。（五）區保甲長，以由各級民意機關依法選舉爲原則，但如遇區保環境複雜，糾紛特多，民選區保長因能力薄弱，無法應付，或因案撤免，而區內一時無中心人物足資領導時，得由市政府斟酌實際情形，遴派幹員，前往整理，整理期間，以六個月爲度，整理期滿，再行選舉。（六）區保辦事人員，由民政局故驗合格人員直接委派，並予以合法保障（區公所總幹事，由市政府逕行任免之）。（七）區保人員，分期調集市自治人員訓練班，予以短期訓練，以增長其辦事能力與學識。（八）市府曁民政局，應經常派遺重要人員輪迴視導區保工作情形，並厲行獎懲，以收督促之效果。（九）隨時舉行戶口檢査，務使人必歸戶，戶必歸甲，甲必歸保。（十）寺廟僧徒曁船戶，均須編列保甲，使無遺漏，藉資加强管理（船戶得單獨編成保甲）。（十一）本辦法經市政會議通過後施行，並咨請內政部核備。</p>

<h3 id="c74">報館業同業公會　籲請迅定配紙額　推七代表昨晚乘車晉京 <a href="#c74" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e74" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">74</a></h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕本市報館業同業公會，以該會各會員報第五·六期應分配之輸入白報紙限額，迄尙未奉核定，日前召開理事會時，特決議推李子寬。陳訓　。呂光。劉子潤。孫道勝。陳道夷。毛子佩等七人，於昨晚晋京，向行政院張院長請願，茲探錄該會請願呈文內容於後：</p>
<p>「　自去年歲初政府管理外匯以還，本業仰荷鴻施，配有白報紙輸入限額，次第核准者，計有四期，惟限額旣不數本業各報館實際需要，且限額滬有抑减，於是不得不向黑市購求，以資補充，其價格之差額，</p>
<p>奚啻倍蓗，悉縈敝賦，正苦應付，每期核准報紙限額發表之時日，亦必拖沓延遲，本業向紙商訂購合同，送呈輸管會後，請領進口許可證，又費相當時日。當此公文承辦迂緩之間，外匯比率則歷有調整，遂使會員各報館蒙受一種在意料所及而事實不予避免之沉重負担，影響成本，關係報價，此項艱困已難言喩。今茲第五期購紙限額時間幾過去三分之二（卅七年二月至四月份），而報業分配數額，猶、</p>
<p>杳無音訊。本業在望霓之餘，多方叩詢，知輸入限額分配處，以全國經濟委員會主張多進紙漿，須承意旨，碍難即辦，而全經會則已草具方案，且送呈鈞院審核。謹按報紙之自給自足，確屬振興工業之一道，本業恪遵國策，宣揚文化，對此措施，絕無異議；但末業認爲目前供求現况必須顧及，決不能枵腹以待秋收，更不能畫餅而圖充飢，</p>
<p>忽略實際。查多購紙業造紙，原議本有一定進程，果能如期成功，產量猶　不足，顧至今籌議多時，實施計畫，依然渺茫，國外購漿旣非咄嗟可到，且縱使紙槳地到，交廠製造，亦有種種困難，須待一較長時間，乃獲解決，但各報存紙乘罄，無法株守。吾人未忘二月七日全國經濟委員會在滬公訓同學會俱樂部，邀宴造紙業書商業及工商輔導處等負責人與長官會談席次，有某造紙專家曾表示用一噸紙漿尙難以製造一噸白報紙，此說</p>
<p>當有根據　且紙漿之價，未必低於成紙，殊違節省外匯之初衷。如果自行造紙，加以其他原料，工資廠費等項，恐國產紙一噸之値，勢必超過舶來紙一噸之値甚多，如此代價，更非國內報業所克荷負。至於成紙輸入，在訂約後尙須歷二三月始可抵埠，第五期配額原供各報本年二·三·四月份應用，現在二三兩月已過，限額尙未得分配，各報無從定購，縱令限額立即分配就緒，已非三個月後不克到貨，届時各報將何以延讀刋行，不致中輟，此更爲本業惴惴不安之</p>
<p>嚴重問題　深引惶悚。爰推代表李子寬，陳訓　，呂光，劉子潤，孫道勝，陳道夷，毛子佩等七人，漏夜晋京，謹向鈞長呼籲，務懇秉持正義，瞻徇事實，迅予督飭各主管單位，促將第五六期輸入白報紙限額，尅日核定，本會應分配得之數額，仍縱第四期原數，勿予核减。本會爲維持業一務前途之絕續，瀝叙苦衷，仰祈俯察，一切未盡，當由該代表等面陳端委，不勝屛待。」</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕本市立委選舉區域候選人周一志。陸梅僧。趙芝玫等，認爲辦理選舉不無若干缺點，曾向法院提起訴訟，頃悉周氏等經交換意見後，已將訴訟自動撤回，吳市長對渠等頗表欽佩。茲將周氏及吳市長之談話分誌如下：</p>
<p>周一志·陸梅僧·趙芝攻等談話云：關於本市立委選舉訴訟一案，我們都是原吿，用意無他，總希望今後上海市的選政有一個澄淸改進的機會，敢說我們的動機，是很純潔的。這一星期以內，承市參議會潘議長及項秘書長，熱心奔走關係，我們也曾經同吳市長坦白的交換意見，決定一方面由市府召開檢討會議，對於過去種種缺陷，作一次澈底的檢討，一方面在市府之下，將成立一個委員會，使今後的選政，隨時有機會硏究改進之道。我們在上海都各自有各自的業務崗位，只要我們一審意想有了着落，也就問心無慚，而對於上海的選民朋友們，也可以有所吿慰，所以決定撤回原吿的地位了。　吳市長對周氏等撤回訴訟，頗表欽佩，特發表談話云：「本市立委選舉，區域候選人周一志，陸梅僧，及趙芝玫諸君，認爲辦理選舉，有若干缺點，因而向法院提起選舉訴訟，旋經彼此交換意見，誤會冰釋。茲悉周一志，陸梅僧及趙芝玫諸先生，已將訴訟自動撤回，此種對事不對人的態度，實勝欽佩。惟吾國實施民主政治，尙在萌芽時代，硏究改進，自屬必要。今後可成立一選政硏究會，延攬熱心人士參加研討，以期對於此後辦理選舉，在技術改進上，對政府有所建議。個人相信本市如果再辦各種選舉時，定必因此而可獲得再進步之表現。」</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕關於跑馬廳總會產業之處理問題，迄今猶未解決，市府參事室將於今日下午二時半，在市府召集有關機關，舉行硏討會，本市參議會亦在被邀之列。據悉，地政局已將跑馬廳方面之意見整理歸納，並簽注意見，以供參考。地政局以跑馬廳方面之意見，可以歸納爲四點：（一）提出交換之土地，僅指塲內草地跑道，約計面積八十畝，據稱爲跑馬塲總食產業，而要求被交換作爲新跑馬塲之土地，不能少於五百畝建築新跑馬塲及必需之房屋經費由政府支付，於收購跑馬總會產業時扣算。（二）跑馬總會之產業，爲介於草地跑道及黄陂路間之土地，約計五十七畝（草地跑道以外者），及房屋（包括特別看台辦公所及其他建築），俟政府依照雙方協議價格收購。（三）草地跑道圈內之土地，據稱爲上海體育基金保管會之產業，如欲取得該項土地，須與保管會另訂合同。（四）黄陂路西面之土地及房屋，據稱爲馬廐總會有限公司產業，應准許該公司自行決定出售或其他之處置。</p>
<p>地局簽注意見</p>
<p>但據地政局簽注，則以爲收回西藏路跑爲塲，應以收回整個塲地及塲內全部房屋爲第一原則，該西藏路跑馬塲土地及房屋，旣分屬於四個團體，似應邀集各該團體負責人共同商討，以期同時解決，若予個別談判，似難達到圓滿結果。此外關於跑馬管理規則稅捐及派警維持秩序等，尤應根據互惠平等新約及我國政府法令規定另行硏究，不能以交換塲地而有所特殊。關於此點，據記者探悉，跑馬廳方面曾要求：（一）中央政府確定保證，准許兩有關公司，不僅可復業，並可繼續舉行不定期之賽馬，不受干涉。（二）成立一協議，對關於賽馬收益之捐稅，確定繳納限度。（三）准許有關公司之理事人，得訂定彼等關於賽馬適用之一切規章與細則。（四）由賽馬會執事之請求，警察局首長，須派出適當之人員，以維持賽馬塲之規則與秩序（尙有其他條件，不及詳載）。茲悉，關於以郊區土地交換一節，據地政局之簽注，似以原有江灣跑馬塲最爲適宜。</p>

<h3 id="c93">兵役協會潘主委　為徵兵告市民書　兼籌並顧抽籤和志願兵相輔而行　及時起應徵保衛家鄉保衛自己 <a href="#c93" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e93" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">93</a></h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕兵役協會定於今日上午十時，假塘沽路該會舉行常會，討論中籤壯丁之開　及志願兵安家費征收問題。又該會主任委員潘公展爲本年度征兵，頃發表吿市民書原文如下：</p>
<p>親愛的同胞們：本市本年度的征兵，業經完成了一切籌備工作和間接抽籤手續，進而即將自四月一日起開始正式的實施征集了。公展忝主民意搬關和兵役協會，職責所在，曾一再　精竭慮，參酌實際環境，詳研改造，以期旣不違反中央主旨，又　　馴本市地方特情的需要，其間經過與所以必須如此辦理的原因，當這全市役政普遍推展之際，自不能不縷陳數端，敬爲我全市各界同胞吿：</p>
<p>不但公平且合情理　（一）這次六千名兵額的征集，是以正規的抽籤爲原則，發動志願兵爲輔助的，一一者不但相輔而不悖，且更各採取了它的優點所在。因爲正規的抽籤，這是國家爲了實施普遍的全國皆兵建立役政的基礎所在，這種辦法，不但公平，面且是合情合理的？本市爲全國最大都市，自亦不能例外，而且更應力行倡導以爲各地的模範。可是在另外一方面看，本市爲全國經濟文化的中心，一般熱血靑年，目睹共匪背叛國家，横施殘暴，自亦不能剝奪其志願從軍請纓報國的機會，所以爲了兼顧及此，乃有目前這個抽籤和志願相軸而行的辦法。</p>
<p>豫西民團值得效法　（二）我們爲了要加強本市的治安並發揮人和地理的戰鬥優越條件，爰經后人役會議的群賽討論與參誠會的一致通過，堅請中央將此次六千新兵就地訓練，撥配新創的警備旅來保衛本市，以期符合槍不離人，人不離鄕的原則。大家要知道，戡亂剿匪，這不僅僅是爲了國家民族的獨立和自由，更是爲了保全我們自己的生命財產保鄉自救的唯一求生之道。今天當這烽火遍地的時候，我們上海市民尙能安居樂業，這不能不歸功於前　將士的浴血奮戰與英勇的犧牲。但假如我們連保衛家鄕的責任都不能　到的話，那眞是我們上海人的奇恥大辱了。全國都知道豫西民團是共匪的勁敵，他們根據親身的體驗喊出了「死裏求生」，「毁產保產」兩句沈着堅毅的口號，用能殺賊保鄕，完成任務，共呃始終不能蹈入豫西一步。希望本市有志靑年，也能如豫西民團一樣，義無反顧的踴躍從軍，來保衛我們自己的家鄕！</p>
<p>徵收實物作安家費　（三）本年度新兵安家費的征集與規定，比較去年的辦法，不但公平而且周密。我們爲了實踐「有錢出錢，有力出力，有多錢的多出錢」的原則，今年新兵安家費的徵集，就民國十四年至十六年三個年次出生參加抽籤的壯丁，視其家况貧富的情形，分爲五級征收，這比去年一概普遍不分等級的辦法，要公平得多。同時我們更爲了使新兵所得安家費不受幣値貶落的影響，而採取了實物的征收與發給。這樣我們相信不但可以鼓勵熱血靑年更加奮發志願應征，而且由於其家屬的得有安置，生活無虞，自然更增强其入伍保國衛鄉的情緒了。</p>
<p>同胞們：現在戡亂的軍事，正達到最緊張的階段，時局的危艱，也已臨到了最後的關頭。我們要認淸戡亂的目的，即在保衛人民的生命財產，我們如果不願意犧牲自己的生命財產，那末唯有及時奮起踴躍應徵，保衛家鄕，保衛自己！</p>
<p>同胞們！你們不看見嗎？今天匪區無數流浪在我們街頭無衣無食的難胞，他們在共呃未到之前，何嘗不像我們現在一樣的安居樂業？因此我們爲了要避免這種慘遇的遭臨，只有大家起來，「有錢出錢，有力出力」，「踴躍輸將」，「爭先服役」，剿滅共匪，來完成　戡亂建國的時代任務。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕市參議會潘議長昨晨十時，假塘沽路該會禮堂，邀請民食調配會主委任顯羣，社會局糧食科長吉明齋，及各報記者等二十餘人，舉行「民食調配座談會」。首由潘議長致詞略稱：三月份配售食米即將結束，爲從經驗中求改進，故邀請各位對初次試辦情形作一檢討。</p>
<p>獲效至為明顯</p>
<p>繼由任顯羣報吿此次計口授糧之實施經過稱：此次辦理配米，主要任務爲：（一）推行新的經濟制度，獲得公平合理之分配。（二）作爲穩定經濟的初步工作，故民調會並非救濟機構，所定價格無法離市價太遠。食米配給實施一個月來，就批發米價言，上漲比率僅百分之十六·八，零售漲百分之八·三，與其他物價比較，相去甚遠，獲效至爲明顯。</p>
<p>缺點有待改善</p>
<p>惟缺點亦有兩端：（一）最初因米源不暢，致米質參差。（二）三月十三日以前所予市民購米之便利不够。任氏稱：四月份當儘量加以改善，惟四月份所配者係美國米，米質亦有三種，目下正研究配給辦法，予市民有一選擇機會，或將米價依米質分別定價配售，至配米證決於本月底發竣。</p>
<p>今後努力方針</p>
<p>任氏復稱：今後該會之努力方向：（一）如何使此項配米工作繼續進行，（二）逐步辦理其他生活必需品之配給，以求穩定經濟基礎之擴大。任氏報吿畢，即由各報記者提出詢問，均由任氏一一作答。潘議長亦認爲此次配米工作，大體上尙値得安慰，座談會至十二時始吿結束。</p>
<p>最後一天售米</p>
<p>據悉：截至本月廿五日止，民食調配委員會共配米三十九萬一千三百九十二萬石三斗九升八合，已購食米市民計三百九十一萬三千九百廿四人，占全市總人口約五分之四。三月份購米，今爲最後一日，　禾購米市民速往米店購買。</p>

<h3 id="c96">現階段山東戰局 <a href="#c96" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e96" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">96</a></h3>
<p>〔本報濟南廿三日訊〕在沂　山區根據地未摧毀之前，山東對於匪軍之重要性，僅次於東北，國軍認淸這一點，主力亦始終放在山東戰塲。自魯中軍事吿一結束，陳毅·劉柏誠匪部的主力化整爲零，相繼南下後，山東有了一個比較平埥的局面。但曾幾何時，魯局又發生動盪，自本月十日起，匪軍利用國軍兵力分散於散全省，同時各地的軍取首長在省垣參加戰亂講習會，地方負責無人的時機，發動一個新的攻勢。</p>
<p>這個攻勢　開始於膠濟路西段，以陳毅匪部第七第九縱隊爲主力，使用兵力在六萬二千人以上。其餘各區的匪部，亦紛紛發動牽制性的騷擾，其中有一股竟於十九日竄抵濟南外圍廿五里的歷城，幸國軍兵力兼程趕回，使已經十分緊張的局勢，稍趨緩和。但是十八日夜間，又發現魯西南匪軍約二萬餘人，可能是劉伯承部，自靳家口渡過黃河，進至離大汶口使四十里之處，有切斷津浦路的企圖。軍方判斷在國大開會期內，匪軍在津浦綫必有一個很大的攻勢，以圖影響國內外的視聽，而從現局判斷，濟南必爲攻擊的目標。事實上，省垣已熱烈的在進行一切防禦的措施·「保衛大濟南」在當地不是一句口號，而是一個積極的行動。</p>
<p>要明瞭今日的魯局，必須有一基本的認識，就是匪軍始終保持盤據山東的野心，雖經魯南魯中的慘敗，在山東仍維持着相當的兵力和補給機構。在卅五年一月之前，魯省大部是在匪軍手中，濟南是一座孤城。一月間，王耀武將軍奉命抵濟，僅偕少數幕僚，重兵尙在徐州外圍，當時離省坦八里的週園，即爲匪軍出沒之所，省府辦事人員，夜間均備有衝鋒槍，以防意外。是年二月，國軍主力兵國入魯，進仃沂蒙山區的艱苦軍事行動。當時匪軍在山東，已有長期的準備，全境共分成冀·魯·豫，渤海，魯中，魯南，膠東，濱海等六個軍區，分工合作，呼應很是靈便·而留守的部隊，是以精銳聞名的陳毅·劉伯誠匪部，正規的兵力即在十縱隊以上，地方的民團尙不在內。國軍在勝和過程中，曾付出相常的代價，李仙　的被俘和張　甫的殉難，說明了勝利非可傍致。迨是年九月，國軍在南麻和臨沂兩役擊破了匪軍的主力，前者搶到了他們的倉庫，後一役打破了他們二，三，六，七，九，五個縱隊的主力，使陳毅匪部受到三萬以上的損失。此外，匪車的第一，四，八；十，四個縱隊，亦在魯南地區受到國軍的打擊·國軍摧毀魯中根據地的使命是完成了，但是很可痛惜的是只差一點沒有能圍殲匪軍的主力，留下山東今日的禍根。高級軍事人員很坦白的表示；這些不是指揮的錯誤，而是地形和士兵體力的限制。當時，陳毅匪部在國軍窮追之下，固然已是沿路拋棄武器，改穿民服，分散的逃兵，談不上再有戰鬥的意志。可是，追剿的歐震兵團的士兵，亦在山地把脚都跑壞了，有的且因疲勞過度致死的。所以經此大戰，匪軍確是被擊散削弱了，但是仍舊留在山東。</p>
<p>接着發動的是膠東之役，自九月開始至十二結束。除摧毀匪方的膠東基地之外，最大的收穫是烟台之收復，切斷了匪軍最重要的海上補給綫。而津浦南段，亦自十二　起通車至濟南，迄今　被破壞。回憶陳毅盤據沂蒙山區時，口口聲聲的說到「徐州渡中秋，南京　新年」，再回想到當時的嚴重局勢，不難衡量王耀武將軍以下各官兵對於國家的貢獻。</p>
<p>匪軍經過這兩次萬大打擊後，除劉伯誠部聚衆南竄，擾亂中原外，陳毅匪部仍舊在山東，當時計魯西南二縱隊，魯東四縱隊，兵力仍有十二萬人。這幾個月來，埋頭進行整補的工作。魯西南是匪軍最重要的根據地，通常與冀南邯鄲等地合併，成爲今日匪軍在關內最重要的基地。在這個地區內，他們設有建國大學，軍政學院，兵工廠和被服廠，同時亦是練兵的塲所。去年冬天，這裏曾造出三十萬套衣服。三個月來，並曾訓練出新兵十萬名之多·這個基地有它　對外通道，因爲魯北小港郢子口，迄今尙在匪軍控制之下，蘇聯　輪船時常光臨這港口，國軍曾截獲往還的信件，證明這是一個匪方的補給港·東北的軍火物資，可以通過郢子口，運到冀南魯西，再由此而運到中原和接濟大江以北的匪部。所以魯西南的作用，是一座溝通關內外和中原的橋樑，其地位是十分重要的·而匪軍遺留在山東的部隊，經個數月的整補後，目前已增至八個縱隊，合計兵力在廿一萬人以上，地方武力尙不計算在內。這些是共匪今日擾亂山東的資本。</p>
<p>目前戰事的重點尙在膠濟　段，淄川之戰，除國軍用命之外，地方團隊更顯出保　家鄕的精神和力量，山東各省在組　織地方武力一點，致力最早，現在證明已收到相當成果。對於濟南外圍的戰局，省垣高級人員有兩種看法：一派是認爲匪軍此次確有進攻濟南的企圖，因爲他們過去的退却，在兵學上僅是一種「離心的退却」，目標並無改變。現在膠濟路西段的匪軍，已與魯西南渡河的匪軍，搆成一個鉗形攻勢，隨時可以夾擊濟南。尤其値得注意的，是魯西南匪軍的目標是大汶口，而大汶口是第二第十兩個綏靖區接合點，在軍事上是比較軟弱之處。匪軍之用意，分明在破壞鐵路，威脅濟南的後方。國軍的苦處是：從濟南向東，要維持二五〇公里的交通綫，向南亦要維持一二〇公里的鐵路綫。而在轄區之內，有許多大城市必須固守，所以兵力受牽制，不能如匪軍之完全機動。匪方明瞭這一點，所以發生這個攻勢，希望與東北戰塲配合，它對於濟南的野心，確是不容忽視。另一派人士則認爲山東設防嚴密，尤其濟南的外圍工事，耗款數百億以上，以在魯匪軍的兵力，尙不足以進攻濟南。同時，膠濟西段和魯西南的攻勢，在時間上尙不能互相配合·所以匪軍這次進攻，主要目的恐尙在阻撓山東省府的整補計劃進攻濟南僅是一種烟幕。不過這兩派人士均同意一點：就是匪軍鬼計多端，防守之處，常是不來攻，專喜襲擊國軍所不注意的地點，所以包括省垣在內，任何地區都不能鬆懈。其次，是匪軍現在已提出「擴軍百萬，征糧萬萬」的口號，其野心之大，不言自明，在它力量成熟之日，以山東地位之衝要，勢必首當其衝，惟有軍政的配合努力，方能克伏來日的大難（本報記者丁維棟）</p>

<p>〔本報蚌埠廿四日訊〕蚌埠近數日來，難民過境頻繁，津浦路上每次列車，均滿載鳩形　面之難胞，亦有不少跑單帮以維生計者。路方取締殊感困難，因此蚌站竟發生一幕慘劇，緣廿三日晚七時許，津浦路第七十四次北上之混合車，在車站開出之際，麕集月臺之難民準備搭車北去者，紛紛於車輪　動時，搶　車頂，爭先恐後，秩序甚爲紊亂，路警以危險　嚇，並實行　逐，難民不稍顧，依然競相　登，車經第四股道天橋時，因車項擁擠，立被橋樑撞落男女二十餘名口，一時　號震耳，血跡糢糊，慘不忍覩，當時撞跌及碾死者。有邳縣人孫寳鈞等九名，（內女二口）受傷者，計開封人王貴修等八名。當晚由車站方面派人將傷者送鐵路醫院醫療，將死者捲以葦蓆，舁空塲待驗，今日（廿四日）下午二時，請由地檢處派檢察官李國欽蒞屍塲檢驗，驗畢，即由軍站備棺殮埋。</p>

<p>〔中央社徐州廿六日電〕共匪建立經年之所謂「魯西走廊」，現經國軍全部佔領。此走廊地帶原包括舊黃泛區以北，黃河與運河交又點以南之蘇魯豫邊境各縣。因屢受戰事影響，民間損失特重，豫東永城，魯西單縣兩城，且成一片瓦礫，房屋蕩然無存。過去一年間，共匪視此走廊地帶爲擾亂中原根據，軍火被服造船各廠，以及兵伕征集訓練補充機構，悉設於此，經常以兩個縱隊以上兵力潛匿其間。此次國軍展開全面進剿，不僅將共匪一切軍事設備摧毀，且已驅除共匪殘餘，目前散匪匿此走廊地帶者，僅任渡河作業之兩廣縱隊兩個殘破團與土八路李旭華，史效昭，張太生，朱十月各部。國軍除控制黃河右岸各渡口杜塞共匪回竄之路外，並進有仃廣泛淸鄕，掩護農民春耕。據虎口餘生之碭山黨政幹部　與京滬記者團舉行座談會上發表集體意見，主張政府應把當前良機，澈底消滅走廊地帶之土八路，因共匪求食，求衣，求兵政策，均係土八路任先鋒，當坐探，消滅土八路，即可根絕共匪捲土重來之後患。走廊地帶人民，現雖遍體　痍，甚至食靑菜樹皮充飢，然其對匪之敵愾同仇心理，迄未稍渝。京滬記者幽視察此走廊地帶一角之餘，深覺人民確實太苦，但並非苦得可憐，而係苦得可敬可愛。</p>
<h3 id="c112">立院例步討論特種刑庭組織問題展開激辯 <a href="#c112" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e112" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">112</a></h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿五日訊〕立法院二十五日例會討論訓特種刑事法庭之組織及審判條例草案時，發生激將。孫九錄，劉不同，譚惕吾，劉通，陳茹玄，劉志平等仍堅持反對意見，認爲此種特殊立法不唯違反保障人權原則，且破壞司法之完整系統與獨立尊嚴，而與實際問題困難之解決無補。而劉克儁，孫科，林彬，張邦翰，陳海澄，劉　訓等則認特刑法庭爲事實迫需，祇要在其組織及審判方面　密立法，自不至影響人權之保障，應予通過</p>
<p>孫科並肯定聲稱，目前爲　亂時期，不能以平時觀點看今日之措施，共匪不愛國家，決無姑息寬恕餘地，以民主之名而危害國家安全。最終仍以萊經審査修正之特刑法庭組織及審判條例對司法系統之完整與審判之愼重業已顧及，予以修正通過。　此兩案於總統府組織法經討論通過後，開始由劉克儁報吿法制委會三次審査該案，聽取司法行政部及國防部軍法局代表列席報吿，及所作修正決議之經過，略謂在組織方面改爲兩級制，除各地視事實需要設若干高等特刑法庭外，並在首都設立中央特刑法庭；高等特刑法庭受司法行政部管轄，中央特刑法庭則隸屬司法院，分別與普通高院及最高法院平行·至審判方面則應改　擬之一審終結制，除被判五年徒刑以上者可聲請覆判外，並規定可於一定期內可由檢察官以新證件之發現聲請再審，其無規定之程序可準用特刑案件訴訟條例·劉氏報吿畢，</p>
<p>孫九錄首先發難，大聲　呼爲司法系統之完整及司法精神之獨立，渠根本反對特刑法庭之設立·謂普通法庭處理共匪案件可以加速並可從重論刑，而不必另設特刑　處·渠請會衆注意滬律師公會對此案之反對及國內外輿論之批評，並認滬特刑法庭之預爲成立有脅迫立法之嫌。</p>
<p>劉不同繼指出滬上之舞業滋事案，國行坐工案及學潮案均普通事件，而治安當局均欲送由特刑法庭管轄，是適足造亂，此項措施趨勢有步隨法西斯之嫌。</p>
<p>譚惕吾指責在行憲之際有此項不顧人民自由之措施乃開倒車。</p>
<p>劉通亦反對司法系統上特殊機構之再現。　至此劉克儁復說明司法方面以一般法院辦案極忙，認爲可就特刑法庭之組識及審判方面加以修正，保障人權。</p>
<p>劉不同，譚惕吾及劉志平乃　　加强一般法院之效率，另設特刑法庭則屬不可，重者如漢奸案亦並未另組法庭處理。</p>
<p>陳茹玄且銳利指特種刑事法庭之名稱即違反司法普通性之法學原則，民主國家之國會從無　通過特種法之情事，唯有專制獨裁國家之國會始作此種蔑視人權之決定。</p>
<p>陳海　閃避特刑法庭之是否設立問題，而主張特刑程序必須適用於共匪案件國。</p>
<p>孫科則認爲特刑法庭有設立之必要，其理由一則爲依審査修正之組織條例並未使特刑法庭之設立破壞司法完整；二則特種法爲事實需要有成立必要，如禁止投機，走私等，且美國亦有離婚法庭，幼年法庭等特種法庭。孫氏並謂漢奸案之由普通法院處理是在勝利之後，漢奸威脅已解除，今特刑法庭辦案之對象爲共匪，而目前匪勢正熾，不能忽視，吾人對危書國家政府者決不能予以姑息。</p>
<p>林彬則提出接近戰區等地需要特刑法庭之迫切，普通法院多受理不了，倘由軍事機構全管又恐過嚴，反不能收保障人權之效；主張在特刑法庭組織及審判技術方面多予硏究，嚴密立法。</p>
<p>至此劉志平，劉不同囤氏復起立否認有姑息共匪之心，仍反對特刑法庭之另外設立，破壞司法，擾亂民心。陳茹立則指出幼年法庭乃爲兒童心身狀態特殊而設，並非特刑法庭可比，堅決反對特殊立法。然終以爭論時間過長，若干委員多認爲審査修正之組織及審判條例已顧及司法完整及人權保障，乃進行條文之討論。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕本市淸華同學會，定下月三日舉行茶會，歡迎淸華大學校長梅貽琦·梅氏昨於私邸接見記者談：該校敎授淸苦情形，已至難以維持階段。自費學生要求發給公費及職員工警待遇等問題，此次晋京，均須商請敎育部速謀妥善辦法解決。梅氏稱該校每月經常費現爲三億元，而煤電兩項開支即需七億元，學校原有基金，半數移作補充圖書設備之用，至今仍未能恢復舊觀，由此亦可想見戰時淸華大學損失慘重之一斑。〔又訊〕梅貽琦昨表示：北大·淸華·南開三校，今夏仍將聯合招生，惟以交通困難，考區或將减少，三校不久將有聯合通吿發表。</p>

<p>（三）貸款額度　預計爲國幣二萬七千五百七十億元，美金一百六十萬元。</p>
<p>（四）貸款成效　華中區各礦上年度產煤約二百八十萬噸，貸款後七”份起可開始增產，至本年底可增至五百餘萬噸，本區燃煤勉數自給。華南區南嶺鑛上年度產煤兩萬餘噸，本年日標，可增至五萬四千噸，台　區各鑛上年度產煤約一百二十萬噸，本年可增產五十萬噸，以上供應華中華南。</p>

<h3 id="c155">唐玄宗安定皇位的政策　和姚崇的關系 <a href="#c155" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e155" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">155</a></h3>
<p>— 汪籛</p>
<p>玄宗朝政治史發微之一</p>
<p>在這篇短文裏，所討諭的，只有一點，其大旨是在闡明唐玄宗採用了姚崇的政策，安定了他的皇位，因而奠立了開元之治的基礎。</p>
<p>（一）</p>
<p>要了解玄宗在初年對於皇位安定迫切的需求，必須先知道當時有政變頻繁現象的存在。我們試看；</p>
<p>神龍元年（西曆七〇五年）正月，張柬之等推翻了武則天的統治，擁戴了中宗復辟。</p>
<p>景龍元年（西曆七〇七年）七月，節愍太子重俊謀誅韋后及武三思，以未能進入玄武門失敗。</p>
<p>景雲元年（西曆七一〇年）六月，中宗爲韋后所鴆暴崩，韋后定策立溫王重茂爲太子，自爲皇太后臨朝攝政。</p>
<p>同年同月，玄宗討平韋后之亂，擁戴了睿宗即位。</p>
<p>同年七月末，譙王重福謀亂於東都，八月，爲洛州長史崔日知所平。</p>
<p>先大元年（西曆七一二年）七月，睿宗禪位於玄宗。</p>
<p>開元元年（西曆七一三年）七月，太平公主陰謀作亂，爲玄宗所誅，睿宗退居百福殿。</p>
<p>從神龍元年正月到開元元年七月，只不過是八年半的時間。而在這短短的時期內，皇帝就被更換了四個，政變就發生了七次。這是何等險惡的氣氛一在這樣動盪的政局中，玄宗該感受如何嚴重的悶壓！</p>
<p>何以當時的政局竟會有如此不女的現象？我們可能得到的解答是：「這是武則天政治革命所造成的。」</p>
<p>第一，皇位繼承，本是中國政治史上的一大間題。古聖先賢所定立的嫡長襲統制度，並不能完全减滅皇室中野心家的慾燄。唐代武德年間的太宗與太子建成之爭，貞觀年間的魏王泰與太子承乾之爭，已足够顯示出皇位繼承問題的嚴重性，而武則天以女子踐居君位，就更加深了這問題的複雜性。立子，立侄似乎都於理可通，所以，皇子，外戚便一齊參加　奪。此後，韋后，太平公主，安樂公主也都投進紛爭的渦流，其原因也正在得着女子亦可柄政的啓示。</p>
<p>第二，爲了掃除創業埀統的障　，武則天不得不推倒舊的統治團體，爲了適合治理天下，收買人心的需要，她更不得不採用新的選舉制度。在她開科選士，破格用人的兩種方法下，舊門的儒生，寒族的文士，旣得以文學升朝，而不逞的僧徒，市井的無賴，也可以　綠入宦。這樣，仕涂　的千進　便愈來愈多，而朝廷中的朋黨也就因以愈來愈盛。於是，我們可得一結諭說：「武則天的政治革命，影響了當時社會階級的波動，而這社會階級的變遷升降又造成了武則天以後一個短時期內政治上局面的不安。」</p>
<p>植根不穩的朝臣必須依附一個皇后，皇子，外戚或公主作爲將來的靠山，而素具野心的皇后，皇子，外戚或公主也必須鳩合多數朝士作爲政爭的工具。這樣，朋黨的結合便以秘密攫取皇位爲其目標。因之，弒奪的風雲也就不時湧現。當初武則天開始掀起了這狂瀾，結果其皇權竟不免被這潮流所吞沒。這時唐玄宗的政權實係順此潮流的趨勢而產生，當然他得注意如何遏止這種波濤的再起。</p>
<p>（二）</p>
<p>在景雲二年（西曆七一一年）的正月，當玄宗還做着太子的時候，姚崇（時爲中書令）和宋璟（時爲吏部尙書同甲書門下三品）便已聯合提出了安定皇儲的政策，內容分爲三條。</p>
<p>一，出宋王及邠王皆爲刺史</p>
<p>二，罷岐薛二王左右羽林，使爲左右率以事太子。</p>
<p>三，太平公主於東都安置。</p>
<p>原來，宋王成器是睿宗的嫡長子，邠王守禮是高宗的當時長孫。雖說他們自己未必就有覲覦大寳的野心，但是他們在皇室中特有的名份，却很容易被陰謀家們利用爲發動政爭的藉口。因此，在姚崇宋璟的建議裘，這二王就須外刺。</p>
<p>唐代的政權之爭，其成敗關鍵往往以北門禁軍之向背爲判定。因此，姚宋二人認爲咨宗以皇子岐王隆範，薛王隆蒙分統羽林禁軍的政策，在這時必須改絃易轍。</p>
<p>太平公主是武則天的愛女，當時睿宗僅存的同母妹。在中宗御宇的時期，她已在廣樹明黨，自從參預討平韋氏之亂後，其權勢　加煊赫。牠稟受了母氏的遺傳，陰謀和野心都十分可怕。她屢謀動搖東宮，已是公開的秘密，但骨子裏的企圖，恐怕還要遠甚於此。所以，在姚宋二人看來，只有讓　遠離京師，纔能使太子的安全稍得保障。</p>
<p>這三條建議，睿宗大體上都接受了，而且，也都試着實行了。但是，除去第二條還能順利做到外，其餘兩條，實際做來，却不免要遭受阻礙。宋王邠王的刺史之命，在幾天後便行收回，太平公主的蒲州之行，到五月時也就結束。而姚崇宋璟反因此得了離　骨肉的罪名，在二月甲甲，分別被貶爲甲州，楚州刺史。</p>
<p>就表面說，神龍以來頻繁的政變，其結束是以玄宗誅夷太平公主之役爲一轉捩之點。但實際上，此後玄宗皇權的鞏固，恐怕還是由於他在開元初年的幾項重要措施。而這些措施，似乎就以姚崇爲其謀主。</p>
<p>太平公主誅夷以後，在開元元年十月，玄宗隱秘地召見姚崇於渭川，當時就任命他做兵部尙書同中書門下三品，直到開元四年閏十二月，纔罷去他的相職。在這三年多當中，有兩點値得我們注意。</p>
<p>第一：姚崇在睿宗時提出的第一條計劃，在這時實現了。舊唐書八玄宗紀：</p>
<p>（開元二年）六月丁己，開府儀同三司宋王成器爲岐州刺史，司徒申王成義爲　州刺史，司空邠王守禮爲虢州刺史，委務於上佐。（略）（七月乙卯），太常卿岐王範爲華（絳？）州刺史，秘書監薛王業爲同州刺史。（據通鑑二一一又勅宋王</p>
<p>以下，毎季二人入朝，周而復始。）</p>
<p>申王成義是玄宗的次兄，岐王範薛王業都有參預討平太平公主的功勞。這三人或以地勢　逼，或以聲望隆重，所以也和宋邠二王視同一例。宋甲邠岐薛旣然都不能長期留居　師，當然，中央的政治革命便不易再起。此外玄宗又讓他們「委務　上佐」，換句話說，就是不使他們有刺史的實權，於是地方政治革命也就不必顧慮。這措施實在比姚崇在睿宗時的建議計劃得更周密了。姚崇在睿宗時曾提過諸王外刺的建議，而諸王外刺又恰好在姚崇當權用事的時期眞正實行，是誰協助了玄宗完成這件工作，這不是很顯明的嗎？</p>
<p>第二：在硃夷韋后和太平公主時翊贊玄宗的大臣，也在這時被斥逐了。舊唐書九十七劉幽求傳：</p>
<p>未幾，除太子少保，罷知政事。姚崇素嫉忌之，乃奏言幽求鬱快於俗散職，兼有怨言，貶授睦州刺史，同書同卷鐘紹京傳：</p>
<p>遷太子詹事，時姚崇素惡紹京之爲人，因奏紹京發言怨望，左遝綿州刺史。（綿？果？）同書同卷張說傳：</p>
<p>俄而爲姚崇所構，出爲相州刺史。（案張說由宰相出相州，劉幽求亦同時罷相爲太子少保，劉之罷與張有關。）同書九十八魏知古傳（可參考次柳氏舊聞）：</p>
<p>姚崇深忌憚之，陰加讒毀，乃除工部尙書，罷知政事。</p>
<p>通鑑二一一玄宗紀：</p>
<p>（開元二年二月）戊子，貶幽求爲睦州刺史，紹京爲果州刺史。紫微侍郞王琚，行邊軍未還，亦坐幽求黨，貶澤州刺史。</p>
<p>劉鍾張魏王諸人皆於討韋氏，誅太平公主二役中有功，而又均於開元元年末及二年中即姚崇始相之時，或罷相，或貶謫，或流竄。這一重公案必有其重大背景，不可僅以姚崇的嫉功作爲解釋。原來，玄宗在爭奪政權的時期，當然要利用他們作爲羽翼爪牙。這時他的目的已達，而當時又有宗室勾結大臣，發動政變的風氣，當然他也有理由掉換一付目光，把他們看做毒　惡疾。舉二例明之如下：</p>
<p>舊唐書一〇六王　傳：</p>
<p>或有上說於玄宗日，彼王琚麻嗣宗譎詭縱橫之士，可與履危，不可得志。今天下已定，宜益求純撲經術之士。玄宗乃疎之。這件事雖不必和姚崇有關，但却可從此看出玄宗對這班人疑懼的心理。</p>
<p>新唐書一二四姚　傳：</p>
<p>然資　譎，始爲同州，張說以素憾諷趙彥昭劾崇。及當國，說懼，潛詣岐王申款。崇它日朝，衆趨出。（略）（崇）日，岐王，陛下愛弟，張證輔臣，而密乘車出入王家，恐爲所誤，故憂之。於是出說相州。</p>
<p>這件事正和姚崇有關，也正可從此看出姚崇如何利用當時玄宗忌憚大臣的心理來排斥異己。又姚祟奏請貶逐劉鍾事，旣爲資治通鑑正文和考異所否定懷疑，而其　構魏知古罷相事，在次柳氏舊聞裏，也被叙寫得非常委婉。大概後來的史家，對於這位知名的腎相，總不免有些曲袒迴護吧？其實，撇開姚祟的人格不談，單就在政治上的成就說，姚崇的這種作爲，正是他相業中很重要的一點。因爲開元之治的基礎，至少是部分地奠立在玄宗穩固的政權上，而玄宗政權之所以能臻於鞏固，却正是由於開元初年諸王外刺和功臣貶逐這兩項大刀闊斧的措施。</p>
<p>最後，必須附帶說明的，還有四點。</p>
<p>第一，開元八九年間，外刺的諸王相繼召回京師，而貶逐的大臣，也部分地復蒙重用，這是由於玄宗皇位已臻穩固的緣故，與本文所論主旨不但不相牴觸，且可互相發明。</p>
<p>第二，本文中所謂翊贊玄宗的大臣，並不包括龍武功臣及玄宗居藩時的近倖在內。關於龍武功臣事，應于「玄宗時的禁軍統帥」中論之。</p>
<p>第三，姚崇宋璟主持停罷斜封墨勅官及塞絕倖進之路一事，頗和本文所論主旨有關，但以此屬於澄淸吏治範圍，故在此短文內亦略而不論。</p>
<p>第四，宋璟繼姚崇爲相，大抵蕭規曹隨。關於安定玄宗皇位的任務，姚崇旣已佐贊玄宗完成於前，故宋璟雖亦有抑壓玄宗故吏功臣的表現，於此文中亦可略面不論。</p>
<h3 id="c156">與遊游國恩先生論西洲曲 <a href="#c156" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e156" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">156</a></h3>
<p>— 葉玉華</p>
<p>本刋第三期（十二月二十日申報）載有游國恩先生「談西洲曲」大作，認爲西洲曲　起首兩句：「憶梅下西洲，折梅寄江北」，「是男子的口氣」。又說「這首詩就從一個『憶』字說起」，所以全篇都是住在江北的男子憶其愛人的話。只有結尾四句：「海水夢悠悠，君愁我亦愁。南風知我意，吹夢到西洲。」他認爲「作爲女子的口氣更對。」游先生又談到：「那女的是住在西洲，而男的則住在江北」、。因而更知道：「那位男的旣住在江北，則女的所住的西洲必在江南。」游先生解說此詩如此。如依愚見看來，與比恰恰相反。西洲曲通篇是女角的口吻，她憶想的情郞居西洲，而西洲即在江北，由詩中所敍說的情形推測，她的居住地是在江的上游，江的南岸。她同她的情郞歡晤是在梅花節季，情郞離開她到西洲去了不易會面。又到梅開時候，她「折梅」請人寄交給他，所以起首便說：</p>
<p>憶梅下西洲，折梅寄江北。單衫</p>
<p>杏子紅，雙鬢鴉雛色。這四句依我解釋是這樣的：憶想起前番梅花而你（指男的）順流而下去到江北的西洲，今番特地折梅寄到江北去。你看到寄去的梅花就如看見從前的「單衫杏子紅，雙鬢鴉雛色」一樣。此處苜句說「西洲」是地名，次句說「江北」，是就其方位言之。由此兩句可以推斷寄梅的女角是在江的上游南岸。三四兩句單提出「單衫」「雙鬢來說，也無非是希望對方見花如見人的」意思。</p>
<p>「折梅寄江北」下接着「單衫杏子紅，雙鬢鴉雛色」，乍視之似不緊接，細加玩味便可明白「杏子紅」三字的重要。「杏子紅」做梅色，又像「單衫」色，於是從梅色的杏子紅，而聯想到「單衫」。初由梅而涉及服色，更由服色而談到容色「雙鬢鴉雛色」，這是很合理的聯想。此曲通篇是女角的口吻，各句前後連貫，毫無疑義。</p>
<p>若把起首四句另照以下的解釋也可以：「憶梅下西洲」—思憶梅花總該下達（「下」與「下書」之義略同，就是「送達」的意思）江北岸西洲你那裏了罷？「折梅寄江北—單衫杏子紅，雙鬢鴉雛色」—折梅寄江北的人，就是從前穿着的杏子紅單衫，雙鬢像鴉雛色的人啊。首句的語氣，似乎有點放心不下，深恐發生意外，梅花送達不到西洲，所以第五句「西洲在何處」緊接着就是急急一問，下句「雙槳橋頭渡」，言只憑「雙獎」就可前去，內心才略爲寬慰些。一路寫來，情詞委宛，完全表現女子心理，因此我認爲是女角的口吻。</p>
<p>「西洲在何處？雙槳橋頭渡，日暮伯勞飛，風吹烏柏樹」。上言「下西洲」，此承上言「西洲在何處」，下接着說「雙槳橋頭渡」，言西洲雖不可見，而「雙槳」可以送達西洲。此處提到「伯勞飛」就是象徵分飛遠離的意義，那時橋頭雙槳催發，你去西洲，西洲究竟在那裏啊？我只看到風吹烏柏而已，看不見西洲的。別後情形怎樣呢？</p>
<p>樹下即門前，門中露翠鈿。</p>
<p>開門郞不至，出門採紅蓮。</p>
<p>當時分離就在門前烏柏樹下，你走後我常從門中探望你回來，開門不見郞至，只好去採蓮以解悶。下面的</p>
<p>採蓮南塘秋，運花過人頭。</p>
<p>低頭弄蓮子，蓮子淸如水。置蓮</p>
<p>懷袖中，蓮心徹底紅。</p>
<p>此專就採蓮一事申說，言下有無限感慨。看不見你，便時常憶念你。所以接着便說：</p>
<p>憶郞郞不至，仰首望飛鴻。鴻飛滿西洲，望郞上靑樓，樓中望不見，盡日闌干頭。蘭干十二曲，埀手明如王，卷簾天自高，海水搖空綠。</p>
<p>此言飛鴻尙可飛滿西洲，我只好登樓遙望，目送飛鴻而已，不能像飛鴻一樣飛到西洲去。於是撫蘭惆悵，卷簾遠眺，而海水搖空，更增愁思。下接着結尾四句：</p>
<p>海水夢悠悠，君愁我亦愁。</p>
<p>南風知我意，吹夢到西洲。</p>
<p>末尾是說對此海水悠悠，令人生愁，想君與我，均有此感。相見眞不容易。我希望南風把我的夢雲吹落到江北岸的西洲你那裏去。</p>
<p>這種解法，似乎簡便得多，不需要兜圈子。此曲首起云：「憶梅下西洲」是女角憶的，中間「憶郞郞不至」也是女角憶的，先後一致。「君愁我亦愁」的「君」字是指男的而言，「我」即女角自稱，從上文一氣相貫下來，不必把上面「海水搖空綠，海水夢悠悠」兩句分開來，說上句是男角之語，下句是女角之語。篇中的「南風」就是從江南吹向江北西洲的風，游先生所認爲有問題的，在此都可迎刃而解，不必費詞了。略就一時管見所及，抽暇寫出，藉此以就正於游先生。此說也許有問題，我不敢武斷西洲即在江北，仍請游先生考證，不過我聲明一下，此處所說的江，不應只限於長江，南方荆湘吳越一帶的江名多得很呢。（十二月廿一日午夢於滬上曾谷堂）</p>

<h3 id="c157">利他·趣味·自私 <a href="#c157" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e157" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">157</a></h3>
<p>— 伯永</p>
<p>一切行爲分爲如題日所說的三段落，大約不會錯罷？最上等是利他的，最下等是自私的，與世無爭則是趣味。英國性心理學大家藹里斯（即作性心理學的）在「人生之舞蹈」一書中說：</p>
<p>「中國人之性格及其文化中之遊戲的性質，無論只是遠望或接近中國的人，都是知道的。向來有人說，中國人發明火藥遠在歐洲人之前，但除了作花砲之外，別無用處，這在西方看來，似乎是一大謬誤，把火藥的貴重用途埋沒了，直到近來才有一個歐洲人敢於指出『火藥的正當用處顯然是在於作花砲，造出很美麗的東西，而並不在於殺人。』總之，中國人的確能够完全了解火藥的這個正當用處，我們聽說『中國人的最顯曰明特性之一是喜歡花砲。』那最莊重的人民和那最明智的都忙着弄花砲，倘若柏格森著作作——裏邊很多花砲的隱喩——翻譯成中國文，我們可以相信，中國會得產出許多熟心的柏格森派來呢！</p>
<p>靄里斯是奇人，這一段也可稱爲奇文，普天之下，竟有人對於中國人的無理取鬧放花砲表示敬意，豈不是大奇特奇乎？按中國人放花砲，看着是爲了遊戲，其實目的乃是敬神，敬神者，請神協助我們發財之謂也，例如財神，大約是非五千頭或一萬頭的瀏腸鞭不肯光降的，故每於舊年正月可以聽到店家的放砲比賽。這種心理怎麽算得遊戲呢？中記滑稽列傳中說淳干髠諫齊成王以金百斤車馬十駟求救於趙以却楚，有這樣的話：「今者臣從東方來，見道旁有　田者，操一豚蹄酒一盂而祝曰：甌寠滿篝，汚　滿車，五榖番熟，穰穰滿家·」極言其「所挾者狹，而所欲者奢。」這思想大約也算其來觀矣了，「一本萬利」的口號是自古已然，於今爲甚！不在手段上考究，專從目的上立論，那應作商則非奸不可，作官則非貪不可，此皆放砲敬神一念之差也。</p>
<p>所以中國乃是習尙自私自利的國度，有人憤慨之至，甚至於說出「中國不亡，實無天理」的話來，天　雖不可知，人禍却的然可見，不能因爲沒有亡就自己釋然於懷，大大的阿Q起來。說是遊戲態度，中國人未嘗沒有，只是不肯把遊戲用於遊戲本身，反而用於經國大業，古時的半閒堂主人在蟋蟀盆子邊亡了國，近世也有在一夜跳舞中丟了三省的，李義山的詩說得好：「晋陽已陷休回顧，且請君王獵一圍」，於是乎，小憐玉體横陳夜，已報周帥入晋陽一了！李後主人何嘗不忠厚，但專門和小姨弔膀子究竟當不了正經，難怪有人駡他倉實餘廟之日，所對　揮淚者只是宮娥，　宗神器置於何地？我們弄文學的，往往嫌說此種話者過於苛求，不懂人情，可是站在政冶立塲上講，就得換換態度。反過來再看，中國人對於眞正的遊戲，却是煞有介事一本正經的去幹，軍閥時代可能因爲一塲牌九的輸贏　大動干戈，也可以因爲你是屬員，扣了一張白板以致大帥沒有和下淸三番而受申斥以至革職。你看，我們同胞在賭塲上那個不比在辦公廳勇敢而負責？這完全是把　——即遊戲——看做比上週曾聽訓詞及在辦公室看報撩天有意思得多，故爾拼全力以赴之。試想我們若有一天，對於利人的事榮也會這樣認眞，豈不就大有轉機了嗎？吹，非不能也，實不爲也！我們不能不加嘆息。</p>
<p>對遊戲爲什麽肯認眞？有輸贏關係在也，亦即有自我的得失在也·日本人美國人都好意义麻將，但在Club中，把他看做下棋，打乒乓或彈子一樣，不是拿他賺錢的，技術的比賽，不一定非有錢不快活，但中國人就看這個沒意味了，「爲什麽不來錢？無聊！」多半是望望然去之·近來打牌講究百搭花頭，把從前的淸一色大三元之類的技術根本推翻，完全要時間快，勝敗速，而且翻頭加多，可以充分實現「一本萬利」的精神，這眞是整個民族道德走向投機取巧的寫照，而是社會道德總崩潰的前奏。外國人玩橋牌，那是要看一個人的風度氣量心思技巧，中國則專門欣賞沙蟹羅宋牌九，吾人夫復何言！古代有許多遊戲都失傳了，如雙陸，打馬，揣想起來，總因爲他太技術化，費腦筋吧？圍棋今已不大盛行，說不定五十年之後，連象棋也完了，或者麻將牌也有淘汰之可能。所以，從這些方面看起來，我們豈眞如靄里斯所說在性格及文化中充滿遊戲性質者乎？棘門嚴肅，覇上兒戲，相形之下，其別然，實則今日的事情多半是覇上之類也，正事爲兒戲，而兒戲成正經，此其顚倒，非由趣味，乃正因沒有趣味耳。大致也可以說，我們的大病在窮，窮則想拚命要錢，而所調趣味者，被銅臭薰跑了，今之在辦公廳者，幾何不頭腦中盤旋股票棉紗美鈔金條，則其視公事如嚼蠟—假定這公事不能直接使之發財的話—也就不必奇異了。這裏所不能了解的，有了錢而且很富裕的人們，也仍舊沒有趣味可言，祖士少愛財，難道他們的趣味就是黄澄澄的金條而已嗎？</p>
<p>連趣味都够不上的人，除自私還有什麽？</p>

<p>— 雷紅</p>
<p>聽到報紙有縮减篇幅的消息，不免感到忽忽若有所失。頻年戰禍，只見完整的建設逐漸破壞，而不見生產量方面的增加，於是使人們應該吃每餐兩碗飯的减爲碗半或者一碗。這在精神食糧方面，便是紙張的節約。而中國的情形更其可憐者，不但是紙張少，而且紙價貴，出版商覺得「製成品」不及「原料」的容易保持資本，相反的還有蝕本之虞，因此對於書報的發刋，便儘量减縮，延緩，甚至於入於半停頓狀態，形成文化匱乏的現象，說來是够悲痛的。</p>
<p>中國的情形是如此，西洋的出版界也遭遇到同樣情形，尤其是以傾銷世界的美國雜誌界，一個繡花枕頭也露出了稻草芯子的衰頹現象。星期六晚郵週報早已於幾個月之前縮减篇幅，其减少的頁數雖未經檢査過，但從厚厚的一本，變爲薄質的一本，估計總頁數約减少了四分之一。原有一欄一次刊完的中篇小說業已删去，代之以聯續刊載三期或四期的小說。柯里安雜誌同樣比例地縮减篇幅，成爲一本大型的「淺薄」雜誌，其情形似較「晚郵一更悽慘」</p>
<p>美國　誌原是質量並重，旣然因紙貴洛陽，印刷成本提髙，在不願加價以增讀者負担的前提下，便不得不重質不重　，出之於删减篇幅的一途。</p>
<p>最近三月份出版的皇冠　誌更打破了傳統的不刊廣吿的習慣，留出一小部份給與若干廣吿商刊登廣吿，使在此經濟枯竭的現局下，爲不增加售價而保持原有水準的一法。記得十餘年前皇冠雜誌初次誕生時，矞麗豪華，小型雜誌中可稱首屈一指。戰後爲配合一般需要，皇冠於是不惜紆尊降貴，改變方針，成爲不是摘錄的「文摘」型雜誌，使趨於通俗易解。最近又因時代使然，添登廣吿，雖然岡文頁數未加削减，亦可見美國出版界如何在向銷路的荆棘叢中謀掙扎。</p>
<p>文化匱乏的情形日趨嚴重，如其文化能在經濟環境中低頭，則我不忍想像其更　朮的後果是如何了。</p>

<h3 id="c161">斥「遠得很」 <a href="#c161" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e161" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">161</a></h3>
<p>— 念鴻</p>
<p>欠了人家的錢而心想賴掉的，大都嘴裏並不說不還之類決絕的蠻横話，而專用搪塞或拖延的法子，明明存心欠到底，口頭上却總是「明天還」「下個月」甚至「將來」「有了再說」等的詞句，使債主多少存着一些可能歸還的希望，但是這紙支票，事實上是決不能兌現半分的。</p>
<p>把一切推託在將來上，的確是聰明不過的辦法，走江湖的瞎子算命，往往就滿口花言巧語，把顧客的「明日」說得天花亂墜，讓這些落魄失意的人們，沈溺在美麗的未來的憧憬裏，暫時忘却目前的痛苦，終於自願掏出僅有的錢來，送在賣卦看相者的手裏。反正算命的正確與否，瞎子是不負任何法律上的責任的，中了，固然應驗；不幸而不中，那也決沒有再去尋瞎子追回算命錢的理由。</p>
<p>何况明日之後，尙有明日，于遠期支票是開不完的，論定旣要到蓋棺之後，那末活着的時節，總還能够繼續拖延下去。這一種現象，最近似乎流行得很普遍。</p>
<p>例如有人問究竟中國這一個國家有沒有和平富强的一天？答案聽到的雖然很多，却少有肯定的答覆，大多以爲和平富强的一天有是有的，可是遠得很遠遠得很，二十年以後吧？不不，三十年四十年，不不，也許還要遠些。</p>
<p>那種近乎賴債的敷衍說法，實在不値一文，當然，回答的人會了要目圓地他這套「遠得很」之說起見，也會舉出許多似是而非的證據來的，就像說什麼中國國民劣根性不能剷除呀，農民智識水準不够格呀，自私風氣難轉移呀，封建勢力根深蒂固呀……諸如此類，似乎他眞的下苦工對中國社會有深切而獨到的硏究一樣。而聽的人却信以爲眞，於是不是悲觀消極，認爲難矣哉難矣哉；就是反正「遠得很」，干我甚事，樂得今朝有酒今朝醉，胡天胡帝一番</p>
<p>含有于毒素的麻醉劑，往往會被人利用，所以近頃這種理論流傳得極廣，代替了「中國必亡論」，但也消沉了人們正視現實而努力的勇氣。事實很明顯，遠期支票兌不了現，現在早已不是敷衍搪塞的時候。我們知道有一分耕耘，必定有一分收穫，這收穫不會在遙遠的未來，而是就在目前。稍有歷史常識的都知道，歐美各國的强盛，也不過近數十年的事，在銳意整頓之前，就像美國吧，革命前後這羣遷居新大陸的殖民者，敎育程度和團結力，也都是很落後　弱的。</p>
<p>一切的一切，在乎今天的把握，什麼「遠得很」一將來」之類在乎不可知之天的胡言亂語，大可充耳不聞，給他一個不理</p>

<p>提起大學敎授，一般人都會有一種肅然起敬的感覺，因爲他們是全國敎育界的先進，學術界的權威，他們的舉足輕重，足以影嚮國家敎育的命脈。戰前的大學敎授有着優裕的生活，現在各國對大學敎授的生活和地位，也莫不竭力設法使之改善和提髙，但是今日何年？大學敎授竟至於「貧病交迫」「無以爲生」，最後乃出之於自殺的一途，實在不能不令人爲全國的大學敎授和中國的敎育前途放聲一哭！</p>
<p>以堂堂一位大學敎授，連自己的肚子都吃不飽，自己的兒女都養不活，還能够硏究出什麽好的東西來呢？</p>

<p>於廠甸購得紫墨一堄，喜其邪　，上有陰文白字曰「人磨墨墨磨人」，循誦再四，意怦怦然，當與我輩咬文嚼字者同聲一嘆。肯人詩云：「世間何物催人老？半是車聲半馬蹄。「乃言人生一世，趨逐名利，僕僕風　，固極警醒，但係泛指一般，若文藝口人硯。坐守，　墨爲緣，不須勞勞奔走，亦足餬口云云　，似乎不受輪蹄之擾。然而眼前的文房工具，常日銷耗，　墨　，　有如矢的光陰，偕之永逝。墨是物」，聽命　人，形式上是「人磨墨」，實際則一墨亦磨人」。予自少年時　身文字海，而今白髮蒼顏，衰　　甚。讀此六字，彌復　　不　自己。</p>
<p>自墨盒盛興以來，硯已少用。自墨汁有專店，論瓶出　，磨者另有商工，文人可無　自己動手磨墨。自鋼筆及自來水筆行於學界報界，寫中國信札稿件，亦多棄中華文具而用舶來品，於是舊墨之用途漸少於前，大略計之，則：（一）　書家，（二）各衙門機關案牘處，（三）各舊式商店及老派文人，（四）各中小學之習字課等。其大學生人人有自來水筆，雖寫國文試卷及筆記，亦罕用中國筆衆。惟寫標語，貼宣傳品，則洋筆辦不了，非毛筆不可。各校之「壁報」層出不窮，卻爲本國　墨商維持一部分生意，倒是　提倡國貨「之一法，可發一笑。」</p>
<p>古玩的價値愈髙，其實用的成分愈少。飮食日用瓷器碗碟瓶盞，裝璜寶愛，便如廢物。文房用品亦然。吾觀前代製墨名家程君房方于魯之一墨譜」，其形式與圖案，五花八門，乃至日月星晨，山川河嶽，天文地理，人物鬼神，無所不備，一一披閱，如游博物院，如讀山海經，忘其爲寫書應用之墨矣。市儈乃儘量仿造，形式極精細妙肖，其質則有灰有渣，絕不可用，完全「　有其表」。若加以嚴詰，則伊等亦有老實不客氣的話曰：「就是眞墨，好些一先生們亦只作陳設，並不實用，何分眞假，」此語亦可發笑，亦是實情。古玩之癖，原是痴人　趣也。</p>
<p>前淸宮庭之「御墨」及藝家特製之墨，當然是文質俱極優良，但眞品日稀，宋明古墨，更是物　爲貴。已故袁太史（勵準，常州人，戊戍翰林）最嗜此道，收藏甚多而精。半夢昨來函提及，因憶十四年吳柳隅（貫因）主撰正風雜誌，宴請文藝諸友，座有江君翼雲（閩人，法界名宿），談及袁處藏北宋李惟一墨，江君即寫一短文登於正風云：「舊爲吳昌綬藏，後歸袁玨生。墨長四寸六分，廣一寸六分，厚七分，重六兩三錢。一面圖朱門，膀曰閥閱第，右側　內露芭蕉一株，旁　一廂，微田　角。髙處聳一危樓，金塲朱楹，縟麗無比。外有髙梧，結構精密，傅彩靜古·一面作朱門圩字，似大觀帖，撫右軍風格，下鈴一印『何須仿古』四字，印闌蟠雙蝺，證以沈子封（曾桐）所藏明人談墨一册，知李惟一爲眞宗時之墨官，自南唐以來，世居此職，代有傳人。墨隅微磨少許，如精鋼之初發於硎。」蓋不徒形妙而質亦極良。斯爲珍品。歷宋元明淸年代之陳，古亦可觀矣。然吾讀梅溪錢氐論製墨曰：「昔人有云筆陳如草，墨陳如寳。欲其多隔幾年，稍脫火性耳，未必指唐宋之墨，始爲陳也。今言墨者動』李潘，否則程方，甚至每笏數十百金，其實皆無所用。曾見詒晋齋主及劉文淸盡之用古墨者，皆糢糊滿紙，如　如汚，蓋墨古則膠脫，膠脫則不可用，任其烟之細，裝之精，不過置案頭飾觀而已。」此通論也。</p>
<p>予於此道，純視興之所至，力之所及，略有所獲。得乾隆　　墨一方（八角形，羅漢墨共五百尊者五百個樣子，業已分散，故能以廉價　其一二，無力求全，亦　處求全也。又避署山　百　墨，予得其三，皆極美極純。又　墨　墨，金色墨各數錠，圖案及式樣皆玲瓏可玩，即此心滿意足。明以上之墨即未嘗揹意，無此力量，亦無此精神。</p>
<p>舊京之墨店，著名者胡開文氏，在琉璃廠，今尙存在，其墨有「老胡」與「新胡」之分。老胡皆數十年製品，雖不及御墨之精湛，亦擅美術便値。「新　」即工料俱遜，供時下書畫家用之，價亦不輕，蓋此業此工，日見稀少矣。</p>
<p>前代墨工墨業所以鼎盛，原因在科舉，尤其殿試朝考，翰林大考，考差，以及考御史，考章京，考中書等等，雖是考文章，大半以書法之優劣爲墨。書法無須髙古，只以雍容華貴，光潤勻整爲主，所謂「館閣字」「殿體書」非好筆好墨不爲功。墨料之講究「松烟」者，即以其光潤而不浮，細而不碎，黑而不滯，寫出字來，有雅艷沉凝之美。凡見過舊「白摺子」「大卷子」者，皆能領略一二。彼時考試占絕大優勢，則筆墨工之發達，亦相因而至，必然之勢也。</p>

<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 26th] The National Government Committee held its 24th State Affairs Meeting at 10 a.m. on the 26th. Twenty-two people including Zhang Qun attended. Chairman Sun Ke, Foreign Minister Wang, and Vice Minister Qin reported on recent diplomatic and military affairs respectively, and then discussed the proposals. (1) The Chairman submitted the Executive Yuan's proposal to formulate measures for selling state-owned enterprise assets to strengthen issuance preparation, which was resolved to be amended and approved (the original text of the eight measures is published in column 1 of page 2). (2) The Chairman submitted the Executive Yuan's proposal to adjust the treatment of civil and military personnel, which was resolved to be amended and approved. (3) The Chairman submitted a temporary proposal, which was also discussed and approved. The proposal decided to issue short-term treasury bills. The original proposal was recommended by the Governor of the Central Bank, submitted to the Executive Yuan, and then submitted to the National Government. It is now learned that the amount of the bonds is divided into five types: 10 million yuan, 50 million yuan, 100 million yuan, 500 million yuan, and 1 billion yuan, in unregistered form. The term is divided into three types: one month, two months, and three months, with a monthly interest rate of 5%, issued by the Central Bank in the open market. According to authoritative sources, the issuance of these treasury bills is to absorb idle capital and stabilize the financial market.

In addition, five supplementary budget proposals were approved as follows: (1) Supplementary budget proposal for the regular expenses of central agencies for the 37th year. (2) Nineteen supplementary budget proposals for the 37th year revenue and expenditure and the 36th year revenue and expenditure revised for the 37th year for various agencies.

<p>Adjusting the Treatment of Civil and Military Personnel; Decision to Increase Taxes on Salt Customs, etc.</p>
<p>The measures for adjusting the treatment of civil and military personnel are as follows: (1) The treatment of civil and military personnel will be adjusted monthly starting from April. (2) The standard for the monthly cost of living allowance will be determined based on the cost of living index for the previous month in different regions. The expenses for students on public funding and soldiers' rations will be adjusted accordingly. Before the standard for the cost of living index for the previous month is determined for each region, the monthly cost of living allowance will be temporarily issued according to the previous month's standard. After the standard is determined, the balance must be settled and supplemented within the current month (the cost of living allowance for April will be temporarily doubled according to the previous standard, and the increase will be settled and allocated after the regional index standard is determined). (3) The average cost of living allowance for laborers is changed to 15 yuan. (4) The cost of living allowance for employees of various civil and military agencies should continue to be reduced. However, in order to reduce the difficulty of implementation, it will be reduced by 57% from April to June and a total of 10% by December. At the same time, measures to increase revenue due to the adjustment of treatment were passed as follows: A. An additional 100,000 yuan will be added to the temporary food tax per dan, totaling 450,000 yuan including the current tax of 350,000 yuan per dan. An additional 80,000 yuan will be added to the land tax per dan, totaling 280,000 yuan including the current tax of 200,000 yuan per dan. An additional 40,000 yuan will be added to the fishery and agricultural tax per dan, totaling 140,000 yuan including the current tax of 100,000 yuan per dan, which is estimated to increase revenue by more than 80 million yuan in half a year. B. The cotton yarn tax rate will be immediately adjusted to 10% (originally 7%), which is estimated to generate 800 billion yuan in half a year. There are also adjustments to customs duties, etc.</p>
<h3 id="e2">U.S. Senate to Debate Aid-to-China Plan Next Week; Foreign Relations Committee Submits Report Explaining the Purpose of Aid to China <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] New York Broadcasting on the 26th: Washington Dispatch, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee submitted a report to the Senate on the 26th stating that the $463 million aid-to-China plan proposed by the committee aims to give the country an opportunity to "make efforts to carry out self-help programs." The aid plan will be carried out over twelve months, and the Senate debate will begin next Wednesday. The report is in line with the view of aiding China, but states that "under the current circumstances, it is impossible to formulate a practical and effective long-term economic plan for China that relies on U.S. aid. We cannot guarantee China's fate." The report also stated that "the United States is not in a position to be responsible for guiding the Chinese government and its political, economic, and military affairs." The purpose of the aid plan is to meet China's need for the most important commodities, to alleviate the suffering of the Chinese people, to curb the deterioration of China's economic situation, and to enable the Chinese government to have another opportunity to make efforts to carry out self-help programs."</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 25th] As the general debate on the House's foreign aid plan is nearing its end, signs of increasing tension in the U.S.-Soviet Cold War can be found in the House. U.S. Republican Congressman Luo Hong advocated that the United States should sign a multilateral military agreement with the sixteen European countries within the Marshall Plan and China to prevent communist aggression at home and abroad in those countries. He also advocated export controls to prohibit the transportation of military equipment, aircraft, engines, and other materials that can be used for military purposes to the Soviet Union and its vassal states.</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 26th] Communist Senator Bridge said that when the Senate discusses the aid-to-China bill, he will try to expand its military aid. The total amount of aid to China is still $463 million, but he will suggest reducing economic aid from $363 million to $313 million, and canceling the provision for a $100 million military grant, and providing $150 million in military aid to China instead, with the grant method determined by President Truman. This military aid may not be granted unless requested by China, and U.S. troops may not be used for combat missions related to the aid.</p>

Foreign Minister Wang also explained in detail the process of diplomatic policy implementation over the past two years at the tea party. He explained that our diplomatic policy is neither so-called detached nor neutral, but a policy determined based on national interests and world peace.

<p>The Rumor of the End of the Xun Command is Untrue</p>
<p>[Our Hankou Dispatch on the 26th] A senior official of the Xun Command solemnly declared: The various rumors about how the military structure in Central China will change are speculations caused by the Huazhong Pacification Conference not releasing news; in fact, the suppression agencies here are not likely to change within two months.

As for Minister Bai's visit here, it is to inspect and strengthen the suppression of military affairs in the Dabie Mountain area. The rumor that the Command will be closed down is unfounded.</p>

<h3 id="e14">Hong Lanyou Answers Reporters' Questions; National Congress Can Open as Scheduled; It is Difficult to Decide Whether to Start Deliberations Immediately After the Opening <a href="#e14" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c14" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">14</a></h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 26th] The First National Assembly of National Representatives will open on the 29th and will not be postponed. Hong Lanyou, Secretary-General of the Preparatory Committee, declared when answering reporters' questions at the press conference on the 26th: "As of today, the Preparatory Committee has not received any orders to postpone the opening of the Assembly. To my knowledge, the government has never considered postponing the opening of the Assembly." Hong then explained from a legal point of view, stating: Article 8 of the Constitutional Implementation Preparation Procedure stipulates that when the National Assembly representatives produced in accordance with the Constitution have been elected to reach two-thirds of the total number, they may hold legal meetings and convene meetings; as to the number of people who report reaching several times the number elected before the opening, there is no explicit provision in the law. According to general practice, it should be more than half. According to Hong's explanation, the current convocation of the National Congress is legal. The total number of representatives elected is 2,832. If the number of representatives who report reaches 1,417, it can be opened as scheduled. Judging from the reporting situation on the 26th and the number of representatives on the way to Beijing, there is no problem that those who report before the evening of the 29th will reach 1,417. Therefore, the National Congress may open as scheduled; however, whether the deliberations can be started immediately after the opening and the election of the President and Vice President and the amendment of the Constitution still need to be determined. According to Hong Lanyou's explanation, Article 8 of the National Assembly Organization Law stipulates that the National Assembly shall not start deliberations unless more than half of the representatives are present. The election and recall law of the President and Vice President stipulates that the President and Vice President shall be elected with more than half of the total number of representatives. In addition, Article 174 of the Constitution stipulates that the amendment of the Constitution shall be proposed by one-fifth of the total number of representatives of the National Assembly, and may be amended with the attendance of two-thirds of the representatives and the resolution of three-quarters of the representatives present. According to this interpretation, the Assembly must have 1,523 attendees to start deliberations, and 1,523 attendees to elect the President and Vice President. As for amending the Constitution, at least 2,030 representatives must be present before a resolution to amend it can be made. According to the current situation, it is estimated that the Assembly may be opened on the 29th, and the official deliberation will begin after more than 1,523 representatives have arrived, and the President and Vice President will be elected. This Assembly may not amend the Constitution, so the limit of 2,030 people may not have much impact. (Continued on column 5 of page 2)</p>

<p>[Our Beiping Dispatch on the 6th] The spokesperson of the North China Bandit Suppression Headquarters declared at a press conference at the Beiping Yuan on the 25th: The war situation in northern Shanxi and southern Chahar has changed from active retreat to active annihilation starting on the 25th, but the overall war situation has not yet reached a decisive stage. The National Army is looking for an opportunity to annihilate a large group. Nie Rongzhen and Yao Zhe originally intended to use their 670,000 troops to destroy the Ping Sui Railway and then capture Zhangjiakou in one fell swoop, but since the 19th, the war situation in the past week has found that their attempt has been crushed. The local military and political organization in Chahar Province has always been very strong, so although some strongholds have been abandoned, the overall situation can still be grasped. The populace has risen to defend themselves. Zhangjiakou alone has more than 23,000 people forming a self-defense force. The center of the battle is now east of Zhen, and the remnant bandits in Changhanying have retreated. The main force of the Communist bandits is now in the area on both sides of the Sanggan River.</p>
<p>[Our Beiping Dispatch on the 26th] Military News: Victory on the Pinggu Line, one regiment of remnant Communists was annihilated.

<p>[Another Dispatch] The situation around Datong has stabilized. The remnant bandits occupying the Yongdingzhuang and Tongjialiang two mines of the Datong Coal Mine have retreated. The mines have sent workers to clean up on the 25th. The equipment has been damaged, but it is generally good. However, it is not easy to start work for a while. Employees must still return to the city in the evening. The evacuation of important officials to Beiping is still in progress. The Datong Airport has been repaired and completed, and air transport between Beiping and Datong is frequent. Ammunition has been replenished in large quantities, and the public's morale has been greatly stabilized. However, there is a shortage of food. If necessary, it can be resupplied by air from here. The Datong Administration has decided that all people who flee into the city must carry enough food for three months before they are allowed to enter the city.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Sui, 26th] Fengzhen, Changhanying in Southern Sui was under siege for three days and nights. Our reinforcements arrived at 4 p.m. on the 25th.

In addition, fierce fighting broke out 30 miles southwest of Duliu Town, in the northern section of the Tianjin-Pukou Railway, on the 25th, and the remnant Communists suffered heavy casualties.</p>

<h3 id="e17">The Constituent Assembly Delegate Should Act as the Constitutional Implementation Delegate: Vice Chairman Sun Fo Had an Early Inclination for Running Unopposed for Vice President <a href="#e17" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c17" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">17</a></h3>
<p>One of the main conditions Vice Chairman Sun Fo used as a campaign platform for the vice-presidency was: "The Constitution of the Republic of China was created by my own hand; although it has been revised repeatedly thereafter, I have personally been involved in all of the revisions. I am very familiar with every chapter and every article of this constitution, and I have great confidence that I can shoulder the responsibility of assisting the President in implementing the constitution." This condition can be said to be the most powerful condition. Isn't it the best condition for a constitution-maker to be a constitution-implementer? For Sun himself, he has worked hard for sixteen years, from having an ideal to seeing this constitution born, and he has paid a considerable price. However, this is only the formal achievement of constitution-making. For him, the outcome of the implementation of this constitution is more important, and it is even more important to experience whether his achievement is merely limited to the "formal."</p>
<p>Sun's candidacy for vice president also has a coincidence: his current position is vice chairman, which is equivalent to the post of vice president after the implementation of the constitution. Sun served as vice chairman to assist Chairman Chiang in promoting government orders, and the future president, although Chairman Chiang has not announced that he will run, is already very obvious, and no one else will run. Therefore, Sun's candidacy for vice president will still be to assist President Chiang in implementing the constitution. This coincidence has almost become one of Sun's natural candidate conditions.</p>
<p>Despite these characteristics and constraints, Sun did not formally announce his participation in the election very early. It was not until the afternoon before he publicly announced his participation in the election that the reporter, in Sun's reception room, enjoyed the first news from his own mouth that he would decide to participate in the election. Sun is obviously a very frank politician. When he heard the reporter inquiring about the election, he immediately replied that he had scheduled to receive reporters. He spoke clearly and logically to the reporter about why he participated in the election and his interest in national affairs, and explained that his candidacy for vice president and the powers of the future President of the Legislative Yuan do not conflict. He regarded the Constitution of the Republic of China as his darling, and he cherished it with such fervent emotions, cultivating its growth. At the same time, he needed to see it flourish and become great. In his tone, he was so firm and forceful: "I am confident that I understand democratic politics, I am confident in the true meaning of the constitutional provisions. The task of the first President of the Republic of China is to earnestly implement the constitution and strictly abide by the constitution, and I have the qualifications to assist the President in implementing it." He also has unique insights into his understanding of world issues and is determined to participate in resolving these problems and is not afraid to take responsibility.</p>
<p>He has two views on China's current problems: one is the national issue, and the other is the people's livelihood issue. He said that our war of resistance against Japan ten years ago and the current suppression of the rebellion are all for the establishment of a new country of the Three Principles of the People, and the primary task should be to establish a truly democratic country and a democratic society based on the Principle of Democracy, so as to achieve democratic politics. As for the latter, it is especially urgent to be solved. In particular, people with status, responsibility, and insight in politics should concentrate their efforts and make the greatest determination to implement the Principle of People's Livelihood to solve the people's livelihood issues. When the reporter interviewed him, he asked for his political views and foreign policy. But when he was thinking for a few minutes, his wife sitting next to him reminded him that he was talking too much, seemingly worried that he would say everything that needed to be said at the press conference, so this interview ended there.</p>
<p>Once Sun's campaign atmosphere was unveiled, the campaign organization was immediately established. At the press conference on the afternoon of the 25th when he announced his participation in the election, it was like a constellation of stars surrounding the moon. The reception was held in the hall of the Overseas Chinese Reception Center in the capital, and hundreds of reporters arrived. There were many enthusiastic inquiries, and Sun answered them lightly, and they aroused the satisfaction of the inquirer. For example, on the issue of whether the vice president can concurrently serve as the President of the Legislative Yuan, he said that this issue has not yet occurred. If the president cannot perform his duties due to an accident and the President of the Legislative Yuan exercises his powers on his behalf, or even cannot return to the Legislative Yuan, then the Legislative Yuan also has a vice president. Furthermore, the Legislative Yuan can also re-elect the president. On the other hand, if this exercise of power is only temporary, then it will not hinder the position of the President of the Legislative Yuan, because he said that the Legislative Yuan is a democratic institution, and the decision-making power of the Legislative Yuan lies in the legislators and not in the president, and the vice president also has no real power. Therefore, in peacetime, this is not a conflicting issue. Someone said: "What if Chairman Chiang does not participate in the presidential election? Will you change your candidacy to President?" He said: "We'll talk about it when that time comes!"</p>
<p>Sun's campaign organization is built on the legislators of the Legislative Yuan, which he has presided over for more than ten years. Therefore, when someone asked him about the campaign funds, he smiled and said, "I will respect the sacred vote of the National Assembly delegates, and I will not spend a penny."</p>
<p>A very enthusiastic reception, full of the atmosphere of the Legislative Yuan—because the wife of President Sun was sitting next to him in the chair. Mixed in with the group of reporters were many legislators. But swept away the ，is the beginning and the result. (Sent from Nanjing on March 25)</p>

<h3 id="e18">Adjusting the Salaries of Public School Teachers and Government Employees <a href="#e18" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c18" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">18</a></h3>
<p>Regarding the issue of adjusting the salaries of public school teachers and government employees nationwide, the Executive Yuan's political affairs meeting on the 23rd of this month decided on five principles: These five principles have been passed by the regular meeting of the State Council yesterday. These five principles are: (1) Starting from April, adjustments will be made monthly according to the cost of living index of the previous month. The shortfall in subsidies for civil and military personnel in the central government and various provinces and cities in the first half of this year will be added in one lump sum during the adjustment of the special budget; (2) If the cost of living index difference is too large and the number of zones is too large, another relief method will be formulated; (3) The cost of supplementary food and dry rations for public-funded students will be adjusted proportionally; (4) The monthly base salary of public servants will be increased from an average of 13 yuan to an average of 15 yuan; (5) Various agencies will appropriately reduce employees. The method of purchasing and distributing goods in Beijing, Shanghai, Pingjin, and Tianjin will be discussed later. At a time when general prices are running rampant and rising sharply without limit, and the living standards of public school teachers and government employees are declining, the government, regardless of financial difficulties, has decided to make an overall adjustment to their salaries. The principle is valuable, and the significance is significant.</p>
<p>The current era is an era of decline and decline for the middle class, especially intellectuals. The middle class and the majority of intellectuals live off the public school teachers and government employees, and their lives, future, beliefs, and aspirations depend on this profession and career. Due to the soaring prices, the increase in the cost of living, the hatred of society, the ridicule of the times, and the deception of the environment, the status of public school teachers and government employees is declining. Although the government has also taken into account the lives of public school teachers and government employees, stipulating that salaries should be adjusted every three months, but it can never keep up with prices, resulting in a situation of increasing hardship the more adjustments are made; especially after the cancellation of the ration of food rice, the difference between work compensation and living expenses has become a scissors shape, and public school teachers and government employees are even more trapped on the verge of poverty. Lu Hao, an employee of the Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Finance, committed suicide by jumping into the Huangpu River due to his wife's serious illness and heavy debts, and then his wife, Gu Pin, also died of illness. This is a tragic tragedy that is heartbreaking. Employees of the Changshu District Court work half a day and sell cigarettes, peanuts, and melon seeds on the streets for half a day, using their meager profits to subsidize their lives. This is a portrayal of "peaceful resistance" (Gandhian spirit). The same things, the same experiences of sympathy, are full of the world. What an unreasonable and dangerous phenomenon this is!</p>
<p>An enlightened and progressive government cannot abandon "nurturing scholars" and "respecting scholars," otherwise the pillars of the country will be lost. What will the situation become? The Control Yuan of the National Government therefore suggested "restoring the method of distributing supplies in kind to public school teachers and government employees, and adjusting salaries monthly according to the cost of living index"; the Legislative Yuan further suggested that "the government should change the salaries of civil and military personnel to be adjusted monthly according to the cost of living index, distribute food rice, increase the salaries of technicians and workers, and detail the measures for layoffs and resettlement." These two suggestions are good countermeasures to alleviate the current living conditions of public school teachers and government employees. Chairman Chiang valued them very much, and the State Council discussed them several times, believing that the revenue and expenditure of the national treasury should be taken into account, and the problem of public school teachers and government employees should also be paid attention to. If the two cannot be achieved simultaneously, then of course only the former should be abandoned and the latter should be taken care of, which is in line with the national spirit of nurturing scholars. The principles passed by the Executive Yuan this time, except for "distributing food rice" which was not decided, and "layoffs" which were handled with discretion, entirely adopted the suggestions of the Legislative Yuan and the Control Yuan, paying special attention to the monthly adjustment of the cost of living index. Judging from the current economic trend, it is inevitable that salaries will be adjusted monthly according to the cost of living index. Whether the salaries for this month are paid according to the cost of living index of the previous month is in line with the actual situation is something that the accounting authorities should pay special attention to when formulating detailed measures.</p>
<p>According to the usual practice of the accounting authorities and the burden on the national treasury, it would be an alarming expenditure to adjust the salaries of public school teachers and government employees monthly according to the cost of living index. However, this is an unavoidable expenditure due to the circumstances. No matter how difficult it is, it must be implemented. According to the latest estimate, when the salaries of public school teachers and government employees were adjusted in January, the monthly increase in expenditure was about 30.2178 billion yuan. According to the changes in the cost of living index in recent months, it is feared that it will increase by about 40% each month. Based on this, the burden on the national treasury is estimated to be about 42 trillion yuan in February, about 58.8 trillion yuan in March, about 82.32 trillion yuan in April, about 115.248 trillion yuan in May, and about 161.347 trillion yuan in June. In these six months, the total increase is about 489.75 trillion yuan. This is certainly an alarming expenditure. If prices cannot be stabilized, this accumulated increase will only become larger and larger. Therefore, we suggest that the government, while increasing the salaries of public school teachers and government employees, should try to increase taxes, issue bonds, sell enemy and puppet assets, and strive for compensation and sell state-owned enterprises to increase the revenue of the national treasury and open up the financial difficulties.</p>
<p>In short, the government has now made the greatest efforts to adjust the salaries of public school teachers and government employees. The government has its sacred obligations to public school teachers and government employees. We approve of this relatively wise measure. At the same time, we also hope that civil and military personnel across the country will uphold the spirit of "ambitious people do not forget their fate in the ditches," recognize the difficulties of the times, face reality, and the more difficult the situation, the more diligent and alert they must be. This is the highest honor of public school teachers and government employees, and the criterion for serving the community.</p>

<p>(Continued from page 1) Hong Lanyou reported on the preparations for the National Assembly at a press conference on the 26th. All reporters from the newspapers registered at the Congress participated, totaling 300 people. Hong's report gave a brief explanation of the affairs. He pointed out that the preparation work lasted for three months, and the general rules of the previous Congress were used as a reference. However, considering the epoch-making significance of the first National Congress and the financial difficulties, most of the existing materials were used, decorated and repaired, and ingenuity was used to supplement materials to achieve the standard of solemnity and beauty. The number of seats in the Congress Hall has increased from 2,460 to 3,649, and the number of reporter seats has also increased from 120 to 176. Currently, 286 units and 459 reporters have registered, so it is necessary to limit them. The registration of delegates began on the 18th and is progressing smoothly. The travel expenses, meal expenses, and public expenses received by the delegates are all determined by the preparatory committee in consultation with prices, and are neither generous nor stingy. The delegates' dormitories are relatively scattered. The hospitality and services for the delegates are as thoughtful as possible. Shuttle buses are running in the city. These shuttle buses were purchased and rented with the help of the public bus company, and will join the public bus service after the meeting to facilitate the citizens. As for all laws and regulations, agendas, etc., the preparatory committee has drafted them in advance, but they are not decisive and will be decided at the preparatory meeting of the Congress. Hong's report lasted 50 minutes, then he answered reporters' questions and led them to visit the Congress Hall. The interior of the hall is currently being rushed to repair and is expected to be completed as scheduled on the 28th. Last night, he was invited to a banquet by Foreign Minister Wang.</p>

<p>Invited to a Banquet by Foreign Minister Wang Last Night</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 26th] Luo Jialun, our ambassador to India, arrived in Beijing on the morning of the 26th via overnight train from Shanghai. He was invited to a banquet by Foreign Minister Wang in the evening, where they had a lively discussion about the recent situation in India. According to what he told reporters, unless one had personally witnessed it in India, it would be impossible to imagine the depth of Gandhi's influence on the Indian people. Gandhi's sacrifice caused grief and mourning throughout India, and even the radical elements among the Indian Muslims were filled with regret. Although Gandhi is dead, his spirit lives on. Since that unfortunate incident, there have been no more internal strife and killings in India, and the tense relationship between India and Pakistan has greatly eased.</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, New York, March 8th Air Mail] A reporter, having seen news in the Shanghai newspapers of February 20th about the Supervisory Committee for Special Relief Donations designating wealthy people to acknowledge donations, and that former Chief of Staff He Yingqin was also among the top names, specially requested to see Mr. He at his office in the Chinese Delegation to the Military Staff Committee in New York to inquire about his thoughts on the matter. Mr. He was humble and sincere in his attitude and patiently answered all the questions raised by the reporter. The following is an excerpt of the questions and answers:</p>
<p>Reporter: "Have you heard about the recent designation of names by the Supervisory Committee for Special Relief Donations in the country?"</p>
<p>Mr. He smiled and nodded, replying, "Yes, I have seen it in the Central Daily News and Shen Bao."</p>
<p>Q: "You are listed as one of the top fifty wealthiest people. What are your thoughts on this?"</p>
<p>A: "The news in the newspaper has not yet been confirmed as a decision of the Supervisory Committee. According to the news, Article 4 of the donation amount review standards of the Supervisory Committee divides the property value of natural persons and the asset value of legal persons into ten levels. I have no financial resources to invest in industry and commerce and have nothing to do with the assets of legal persons. However, according to the property value of natural persons, the highest level is over 500 billion yuan, and the lowest level is over 50 billion yuan. If I am listed as the wealthiest person, it means that my family's property value is estimated at hundreds of billions of yuan, which is not in line with the facts. I have some property in the country, but its value is actually limited. In any case, I am not qualified to be called the wealthiest person."</p>
<p>Q: "I heard that some people in the country are rumored to have said that you have a large amount of US dollars deposited in the United States. Have you heard about this?"</p>
<p>A: "Before coming to the United States, I had absolutely no US dollars deposited in the United States. After being appointed to come to the United States in 1946, I first deposited the remaining 20,000 yuan from the travel expenses and special expenses issued by the government on August 7th of that year into the Washington Port Local Bank near the former headquarters of our delegation on Long Island, New York State. The account was opened under my name and official rank. This was the first time in my life that I opened an account in a foreign bank. Later, because our delegation moved to an office in New York City, I opened an account at the Bank of New York (Citibank) near the current delegation's headquarters. The bank has records of all income and expenses that can be checked. In addition, I have no other deposits in any other foreign bank, nor do I own any property in foreign countries. Moreover, during the war, I repeatedly advocated that the government should use the overseas deposits of our private citizens. I also made this proposal at the Sixth National Congress of our party, so whether I have a large amount of US dollars or not is self-evident."</p>
<p>Q: "Do you think the method of special relief donations is reasonable? Is it effective?"</p>
<p>A: "I work overseas and am not very clear about this matter, so I cannot criticize it. But in principle, if the country's finances are so difficult, the people should understand the general situation and follow the principle of contributing money if you have it and contributing effort if you have it, and enthusiastically acknowledge donations. If the government can establish and implement property tax rules through formal legislative procedures, the effect may be greater than fundraising."</p>
<p>Q: "Are you prepared to donate?"</p>
<p>A: "As one of the government officials, I should take the lead in acknowledging donations. I have already written to the Supervisory Committee to truthfully estimate the value of my existing property and acknowledge donations in accordance with the methods established by the committee. I have also decided to sell my property to pay for this donation."</p>
<p>Q: "You just said that levying property tax is more effective than fundraising. Do you have any specific opinions on this issue?"</p>
<p>A: "I have been considering this issue for a long time and originally intended to submit a proposal to the Seventh Plenary Session of the Central Committee, but the conference was postponed, so it was not submitted. In the future, I may submit it to the government for reference."</p>

<h3 id="e44">American Investigation Team Announces US Plan to Revive Japan in Japan, Average Annual Loan of 300 to 500 Million Yuan Within Five Years, Clap and Others Fly to South Korea Today for Inspection <a href="#e44" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c44" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">44</a></h3>
<p>[Reuters, Tokyo, 26th] U.S. Undersecretary of the Army Clap announced today a plan under consideration by a U.S. Congressional Committee to turn Japan into a "Far East Factory," which stipulates that in addition to the 300 to 400 million yuan allocated annually to prevent unrest and disease in Japan, an additional 180 million yuan will be allocated immediately to revive the Japanese economy. Mr. Clap and the accompanying U.S. experts believe that under this plan, Japan's economy will be self-sufficient by 1952 or 1953. Mr. Clap pointed out that Washington believes that the establishment of a self-sufficient economy is Japan's primary goal. The Japanese revival plan is developed based on the same principles as the European revival plan. The State Department and the Army Department believe that in order for Japan to achieve self-sufficiency, a considerable amount of industrial raw materials must be provided in the short term to allow its industries to develop. Mr. Clap solemnly denied that this plan was aimed at the Soviet Union, pointing out that its purpose is: (1) to reduce the burden on U.S. taxpayers; (2) to enable Japan to become self-reliant and become a democratic country. He also pointed out that although the Potsdam Agreement stipulates that the Japanese economy should be based on the 1930-34 level, the United States believes that if Japan's own efforts show that it is possible to raise this level without endangering peace, it may be increased. The U.S. plan anticipates that the economic aid funds allocated in any one year will be limited to a maximum of 580 million yuan, but this amount will decrease gradually, and it is expected that the goal of self-reliance will be achieved by 1952 or 1953. Prior to the U.S. government submitting the plan to Congress, Far Eastern Commission Chairman McCoy informed the Far Eastern Commission of this intention. So far, the Far Eastern Commission has not made any criticisms. Mr. Clap then spoke about the plan to dismantle Japanese industry, believing that it should be implemented in a way that does not hinder economic revival. He also solemnly informed the Japanese people that the success of the economic revival plan depends largely on the self-help efforts of the Japanese people. The main key lies in increasing production, and the results of increased production will determine the living standards of the Japanese people. Mr. Clap continued: Since arriving in Japan, he has found many encouraging phenomena in the gradual development of the Japanese economy, such as the 20% increase in coal production, which is close to the goal of 3 million tons per year, and the rice collection plan has been fully successful. In recent months, the tax system has also been significantly improved. In addition, the Japanese government has also set a goal to increase food production by 10% compared to last year. However, the unfavorable aspects also include the rise in price levels, the increase in the amount of paper money in circulation, and the world's dollar panic, which reduces the purchasing power of importing countries. Mr. Clap also revealed that after arriving in Japan, they also considered the economic problems caused by the increase in the Japanese population, but have not yet found an answer. Finally, he stated that the goal of the Japanese economic revival plan is to make Japan a Far East Factory, but he does not believe that the Japanese economy will harm the economies of other countries in the Far East.</p>
<p>[United Press, Tokyo, 26th] The five members of the U.S. Industrial Mission to Japan, led by U.S. Undersecretary of the Army Clap, are scheduled to leave here at 7:00 a.m. on Saturday to fly to the U.S. military zone in South Korea for a brief visit. The group includes Clap, former Chairman of Chemical Bank Trust Company Johnston, Chairman of Studebaker Automobile Company Hoffman, New York textile broker Hurl, economic expert Liesman, and three officers from the Army General Staff.</p>
<h3 id="e45">Question of Returning Property Seized by Japan, Marshall Issues Statement, Partial Authorization to MacArthur Is Not to Avoid the Far Eastern Commission <a href="#e45" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c45" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">45</a></h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 25th] Secretary of State Marshall denied on the 25th that the United States' attempt to return property seized by Japan from the Allies was to circumvent the Far Eastern Commission. He announced at a news conference that the U.S.'s recent recommendations to MacArthur regarding the distribution of this property detained in Japan can only be applied to parts of the return policy on which the Allies have no objections. In response to outside criticism of the U.S. government's direct contact with MacArthur regarding return procedures, Marshall read the following statement to the press:</p>
<p>"According to the terms of the Far Eastern Commission, the United States has the right to issue orders to the Allied Headquarters at any time when an emergency occurs and the event is not within the scope of the policy already established by the Commission, pending further action by the Far Eastern Commission. In this case (regarding the return of seized property), there has been an agreement on part of the return policy in the past, but because many countries harmed by Japan believe this matter is very urgent, the United States believes it is necessary to provide policy guidance to the Allied Headquarters. The instructions issued by the United States to the Allied Headquarters only include the part of the return plan on which the countries have no objections. The part of the return policy that has not been agreed upon is still under discussion in the Far Eastern Commission." At the same time, it was learned from reliable sources that U.S. Far Eastern Commission Representative McCoy informed the Far Eastern Commission that, regarding the handling of seized property in Japan, requests had been repeatedly made to grant MacArthur the authority to handle certain types of seized property not included in the current Far Eastern Commission instructions. McCoy explained the recent temporary directive issued by the U.S. government, authorizing MacArthur to have this authority, stating that some of this property, currently stored in Japanese warehouses, is being damaged. Countries occupied by Japan during the war and subjected to Japanese seizure are extremely concerned about the return plan. Representatives from China, France, Australia, and the Netherlands believe this is a matter of urgency. McCoy pointed out that the Far Eastern Commission has been engaged in negotiations on the return issue since 1946. The countries have been able to reach some agreed terms on the return of seized property found in Japan, and the intention is to merge them into their policy, which is an annex. McCoy said that the representatives of the ten countries of the Far Eastern Commission had endorsed an expanded policy, but only one country's representative did not endorse it, and the reason for not endorsing it was because the agreement omitted a provision that was of particular interest to them, rather than opposing the expanded policy endorsed by their colleagues, which also shows the extent of the consensus. Due to the consensus of the representatives, which is necessary for policy decisions, the expanded policy was not passed. Millions of People Participating in Strike</p>

<p>[New Asia News Agency, Seoul, 26th] U.S. Military Governor of South Korea, General Lerch, stated yesterday while hosting reporters: "April is a critical juncture for Korea. The Korean people should rise up for democracy and pay attention to the activities of communists." General Lerch resolutely declared that anyone who attempts to obstruct the elections through riots will be regarded as instigated by the North Korean Labor Party. A reporter asked about rumors of U.S. troop reinforcements to South Korea. General Lerch replied: "The U.S. military has no ambitions for bases in South Korea. I have heard that the U.S. occupation authorities have requested the Army Department to send additional troops, but the details are unknown."</p>
<p>[United Press, Seoul, 26th] According to broadcasts today on two occasions by the Pyeongyang radio station controlled by Soviet forces, the Soviet occupation forces command in northern Korea has invited leaders from right-wing, left-wing, and centrist parties in southern Korea to hold a meeting on April 14th to assist in establishing a Korean government under Soviet protection. Kim Ku, leader of the Korean Independence Party, and other political leaders who oppose the May 9th general election plan are among those invited. However, Kim Ku has not commented on this.

<h3 id="e49">Soviet Representative Declares Maintaining the Four-Power Joint Control System in Germany, Western Allied Front Wins <a href="#e49" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c49" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">49</a></h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] London, 26th Broadcast: Berlin News, The Soviet representative to the Berlin Allied Control Council withdrew from the talks last Saturday, putting the future of the Control Council in serious danger. However, today the Soviet side has indirectly yielded to U.S. General Clay. In a policy statement, a senior Soviet official announced that the Four-Power Conference would continue to be held. It is believed that Marshal Sokolovsky, who withdrew from the meeting last Saturday, will reconvene the Control Council meeting on March 30th. The Soviet statement is considered a victory for General Clay. According to reports, General Clay, together with British and French representatives, informed the Soviet side on Tuesday that the three Western powers did not intend to attend the Four-Power working group meetings until the Soviet side convened a central meeting of the Control Council.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Berlin, 26th] Lieutenant General Lukan Chenko, Chief of Staff of the Soviet Military Government in Germany, recently stated that the Soviet Union supports the continuation of the Four-Power control system in Germany and hopes to preserve the Allied Control Council to implement the decisions of the Potsdam Conference. This is the first official statement from the Soviet representative regarding the withdrawal from the Allied Control Council meeting last Saturday, expressing hope for the continued existence of the Four-Power joint institutions in Germany. However, there was no request for the Allied Control Council to hold a meeting on March 30, the date of the next regular meeting. (According to the Allied Secretariat's charter, the holding of regular meetings of the Allied Control Council must be notified four days in advance.) Allied sources generally believe that the Soviet Union deliberately abandoned the last opportunity to convene a meeting of the Allied Control Council.</p>
<p>General Lukan Chenko stated, "We are willing to strictly comply with the decisions of the Potsdam Conference and the rules of Four-Power joint control in Germany. During the period when the Allied Control Council can take the most expeditious action to fulfill the goals of the Potsdam resolutions, the Soviet representative will support the Allied Control Council and its institutions in every way. However, the Soviet representative is completely opposed to using the Allied Control Council as a shield to cover up the unilateral actions of the Western occupying powers. We cannot support an Allied Control Council that is only nominally functional and is used by the British, American, and French to conceal their divisive measures in West Germany. Since mid-1947, almost no agreement has been reached on the various matters discussed by the Allied Control Council. Our conclusion is that the Allied Control Council is no longer a legislative and administrative institution, but has gradually become a forum for debate. The Western Allies bear full responsibility for the deadlock in the Four-Power control mechanism." General Lukan Chenko also stated that the Soviet Union, in its capacity as chairman, announced the indefinite postponement of the Four-Power Liaison Committee on March 23 for technical reasons.</p>

<h3 id="e52">Marshall Sternly Reprimands, Soviet Plots to Disrupt Unity, Soviet Far East Elite Troops Increase Defense of Berlin <a href="#e52" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c52" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">52</a></h3>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 25th] Secretary of State Marshall warned the Soviet Union today that the U.S. occupying authorities have no intention of being forced to withdraw from Berlin. Marshall stated at a press conference that the Soviet representative to the Berlin Allied Control Council has repeatedly blocked U.S. efforts to make the council an effective institution for three years. Any future attempts to undermine the authority of the Allied Control Council, such as the actions of the Soviet representative on March 20th, will be regarded as an effort to oppose the Four-Power agreement on German policy and will be seen as a unilateral action obstructing German unification. Under the international agreements binding the Four Powers, the United States will fulfill its responsibilities as a member of the Allied Control Council and will continue to be a joint occupier of Berlin. Marshall also pointed out that the German People's Congress hosted by the Socialist Unity Party of Germany is a communist-controlled organization without the support of other parties and condemned by other parties. Therefore, the authorities in the West German merged zones do not allow it to operate within their borders. The so-called German People's Congress cannot claim to be representative of the entire German people.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Berlin, 25th] The Swiss "Geneva Daily" published today that the Soviet Union has stationed elite troops around Berlin, just like in 1945. The Soviet army contains superior units, such as special detachments from Tartar, Mongolian, and Kalmyk Siberian regions. Several divisions recently arrived in the Berlin area, some of which came directly from Arkhangelsk in Siberia. The strength of the armored divisions around Berlin amounts to 31,500 men. The Allied side has not increased its military strength, but it is generally believed here that the Allied air force will greatly increase its strength in the near future.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Frankfurt, 25th] General Clay, commander of the U.S. forces in Germany, stated at a press conference here today that the crisis between the countries of Western Europe and the Soviet Union is a political event. Allied reporters asked General Clay whether he believed he could put out the fire, comparing the U.S. Army to a fire brigade preparing to rush to the scene of a fire. General Clay replied, "I am a soldier, not a politician. Soldiers are not afraid of tomorrow or the future. As for the crisis that has just occurred in Berlin, it is purely political in nature. The State Department's transfer of the U.S. occupation zone in Germany to the management of the Army Department has not changed the policy of the United States currently being implemented in Germany. The training of the troops will continue as originally planned, and the major U.S. military exercises this spring will still be carried out as in previous years."</p>

<h3 id="e59">Foreign Submarines Appear on the West Coast, U.S. Needs to Build a Strong Navy, Navy Secretary Testifies Before Senate Armed Services Committee <a href="#e59" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c59" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">59</a></h3>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 25th] Navy Secretary Sullivan revealed while testifying before the Senate Armed Services Committee that several submarines not belonging to any country west of the Iron Curtain have recently been discovered off the U.S. coast. Although Sullivan did not specify the nationality, among the countries behind the Iron Curtain, only the Soviet Union has a submarine fleet. Sullivan also said, "Although I do not intend to overemphasize these incidents, we still remember that the Germans in 1917 and 1941 did scout off the U.S. coast with submarines." According to a senior U.S. Navy official, foreign submarines have recently been discovered off the U.S. Pacific coast three times. One was discovered 320 kilometers from San Francisco, one was discovered ten days ago by a U.S. aircraft outside the Aleutian Islands, and another U.S. merchant ship discovered the periscope of a submarine at Johnston Island Naval Base, 1,280 kilometers from Hawaii.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 25th] U.S. Navy Secretary Sullivan today asked the Senate Armed Services Committee to build a stronger navy. He pointed out that the Soviet Union has acquired dozens of new German-style submarines, including four of the latest design, equipped with "Schnorchel" equipment, which can pass electricity underwater and have a very high underwater speed. They are extremely effective in submarine warfare tactics and extremely difficult to detect or counterattack. The four major German submarine manufacturing plants are now under Soviet control. All the submarines used by Germany in the last war came from these four manufacturing plants, which have all kinds of secret drawings and the latest submarine parts. Sullivan specifically pointed out that at the outbreak of World War II, Germany had only fifty submarines, which had almost won the Battle of the Atlantic. Now the Soviet Union has 250 submarines and is more likely to manufacture a large number of the latest submarines that are more effective than those used by Germany during the war in the short term. The strategic materials needed by the United States all rely on sea lanes for entry, but so far there are no countermeasures to deal with new submarines. Research shows that a complete solution is extremely difficult to find. Sullivan advocated strengthening the U.S. Navy's strength to the permissible extent as soon as possible. If it relies solely on the strength of the U.S. Navy's existing fleet, it may cause a tragedy. The number of U.S. active-duty naval personnel is 185,000 fewer than the permissible strength, which is only enough to operate 277 combat warships and 466 small and auxiliary warships. According to the recent decision of the Florida Chiefs of Staff Conference, the U.S. Navy will build an 80,000-ton aircraft carrier.</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 25th] Air Force Secretary Symington told the Senate Armed Services Committee today that U.S. long-range bombers can take off from Alaska, bomb any place in the Soviet Union, and then fly back to U.S. bases. The U.S. Air Force currently has 55 combat units. Although the organization is very complete, it is still a peacetime organization, which is weak compared to the 243 units it had during World War II, but it can also be used as the core for expansion. Symington also said that the latest B-29 Superfortress can fly straight for more than 2,000 miles, and with the latest in-flight refueling technology, it can penetrate any corner of the Soviet Union.</p>

<p>[Reuters, Athens, 25th] Greece celebrated the 127th anniversary of its independence today. King Paul of Greece participated in religious ceremonies in the cathedral and then presided over a military parade. He issued a proclamation to the people, expressing that despite the current crisis, he still has full confidence in the future. Greek Prime Minister Sophoulis said that Greece is no longer isolated and without armaments and hopes to defeat the guerrillas soon.

<p>[United Press, Washington, 26th] President Truman sent a telegram to King Paul of Greece on Greek Independence Day, saying that totalitarian forces are planning to exploit human dignity and freedom with the help of violence and terror in order to expand their power. Although Truman did not specify what the totalitarian forces were, he was clearly referring to communism. He said that free people should show courage and determination to defend their independence.</p>

It is expected that very few civil servants will leave office due to the purge, but it is also a fact that some are obsessed with communism.

The entire House of Commons unanimously agreed with the Prime Minister's opinion, with the exception of the infuriated Communist Member of Parliament Gara, who said that the purge order was instigated by American tycoons, and the United States wanted to make Britain an outpost for American monopoly capitalists to attack Europe.</p>

<h3 id="e65">The Fabian Society of England <a href="#e65" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c65" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">65</a></h3>
<p>— (This article by Bengeng)</p>
<p>The Labour Party is now in power in England, and it seems that the Party owes its current prestige to two organizations: the Fabian Society and the Trade Union. The purpose of this article is to provide a brief introduction to the Fabian Society.</p>
<p>(I)</p>
<p>The Fabian Society was founded in 1884, with David Davidson, Bomore Booth and others as the initial founders. Later, George Bernard Shaw, Sidney Webb, and others joined. Its purpose was to reform society. As to why it is called the Fabian Society, it is said to be named after the surname of a Roman general. Around 300 BC, there was a family in Rome named Fabius, which produced many famous people. Around 200 BC, a general named Quintus Fabius Maximus emerged. This general was known for his cautious tactics in his war against Hannibal. The "Fabian" in the Fabian Society is derived from the surname of this general. In 1889, the Fabian Society published a book entitled "Fabian Essays," written by George Bernard Shaw, Sidney Webb, Beasant, Wallas, and others. This book explained their views and also brought the Fabian Society to the attention of various quarters. Since then, more than two hundred treatises have been published successively, discussing various issues.</p>
<p>When the Fabian Society was founded, there was no Labour Party in England. It was not until 1893 that England had an Independent Labour Party. It was not until 1900 that England had the current Labour Party. However, at that time, in addition to the Fabian Society, there were two other organizations in England that also advocated socialism: the Social Democratic Federation and the Socialist League. However, the views of these two groups were generally radical and differed from those of the Fabian Society.</p>
<p>(II)</p>
<p>Generally speaking, the Fabian Society advocates the gradual transformation of society, hoping to achieve socialism through the use of the universal suffrage system and representative government. In other words, they believe that the transition from a capitalist society to a socialist society is a gradual evolutionary process, not a revolutionary process. Therefore, although the Fabian Society advocates socialism, it is different from Marxism. Marx believed that the realization of socialism was due to the proletarian revolution, which was the result of the inherent contradictions in capitalist society. According to this theory, the more miserable the lives of the proletariat, the more ripe the opportunity for revolution. However, the members of the Fabian Society believe that various social reforms since the nineteenth century, such as the Factory Act and the Mining Act, have indicated that socialist reforms have already begun within capitalist society. Thus, they believe that the application of modern democracy can realize socialism through a representative system.</p>
<p>However, although the Fabian Society has the above-mentioned views, it cannot be said to be a political party in itself. First, according to its constitution, its purpose is to establish a new society in which economic privileges are abolished through public ownership, while the goal is to achieve this through political democracy. However, apart from that, they do not talk about "dogma." In the books and periodicals published by the Fabian Society, the first page always states that "this book represents the author's personal opinion, not the collective opinion of the Fabian Society." In other words, it is an organization that only seeks "universal harmony," and its attitude towards personal opinions is liberal. Second, the Fabian Society has an important position in England, but apart from publishing specialized cultural and educational works, it only helps other groups or its members to engage in political activities, and it never participates in actual political actions itself. The establishment of the Independent Labour Party in England was aided by it, and the emergence of the Labour Party in England was even more due to the help of the Fabian Society. Now, many Fabian Society members are important figures in the Labour Party, but if one were to say that the Fabian Society is affiliated with the Labour Party, or that the Labour Party is affiliated with the Fabian Society, then it is not necessarily entirely correct, although the Labour Party's views, generally speaking, are derived from the Fabian Society's views. Five years ago, the Fabian Society had only about two thousand members and a dozen local branches. Now, it has about five thousand members and more than one hundred local branches. Judging from the situation in the past five years, it can be said that it has developed not slowly. However, if one looks at the Fabian Society's sixty-year history, it cannot be said that it has developed quickly. The reason for this is simple: it is a group with political views but no political action. At the same time, the intellectual level of Fabian Society members seems to be quite high, so there are naturally not too many members.</p>
<p>(III)</p>
<p>The current work of the Fabian Society seems to be mainly focused on education and culture. In addition to frequently organizing summer schools, weekend schools, and various discussion meetings, it has two very important working departments, namely publishing and research. Regarding publishing, there is Fabian News, which is a publication that reports on the situation of the Fabian Society. There is the Fabian Quarterly, which is a publication that publishes various special studies and reports, and also serves as a forum for discussing various issues. In addition, there are "Fabian Tracts" and "Research Series." More than two hundred of the former have been published, and more than one hundred of the latter have also been published. However, such publications are often not very long. There are also other publications in book form, such as Robson's "Public Enterprise," and recently there have been several "Discussion Pamphlets." Regarding research, the Fabian Society originally had a domestic issues research department. In 1931, a New Fabian Research Bureau was established outside the Fabian Society, and it cooperated with the Fabian Society. The founders, such as Attlee (the current British Prime Minister), Cripps (the current Chancellor of the Exchequer), Dalton (the former Chancellor of the Exchequer), and Bevin (the current Foreign Secretary), are all key members of the Fabian Society. This Research Bureau officially merged with the Fabian Society in 1939. The scope of their research is very broad. Specific issues are sometimes researched by a committee, and sometimes by specific members. The results of the research are then criticized by designated members, but the focus of their criticism is not on whether the research results can be agreed with, but on whether sufficient research has been conducted from the perspective of socialists. In other words, the results of the research, whether published or not, do not represent the "Society" but only represent the "individual." This is because, in addition to striving for socialism and democratic politics, which is a common goal, the Fabian Society does not have a "party line." Under such a broad scope, differences of opinion are inevitable, and they allow for the existence of such "differences."</p>
<p>(IV)</p>
<p>As mentioned above, we can know that the Fabian Society has two major characteristics: first, it can be said to be a group of socialists, but they also believe in democratic politics; second, it is a group with political views that does not directly participate in political actions. Due to the first point, they have great differences with the Communist Party. They oppose dogma or Bible-like party programs, and they do not adopt strict organization. Under "universal harmony," the existence of individuals is allowed. Due to the second point, although they have close ties with the Labour Party, they do not have organizational ties. Their members participate in politics, but their group exists outside of politics. This approach may be because they believe that socialism is not a fixed definition, but rather a set of principles. Because they are principles, discussion and "minor differences" must be allowed. At the same time, they believe that socialism is not simply a political issue, but also includes "theory" and the daily way of life of society. This group is willing to devote itself to the socialist movement outside of politics. From our point of view, the Fabian Society can be said to be a kind of "new liberalism." They inherit some of the ideas of old liberalism, advocating democratic politics and respecting groups. At the same time, due to the development of society, they understand the necessity of socialism. Although it has a history of sixty years, it still represents a school of thought in Europe today, existing between capitalism and communism. Looking at the policies of the British Labour Party today, we can know that it has a great influence on British politics. (London, February 20, 1948)</p>
<h3 id="e66">Truman Calls for Truce in Holy Land; Arabs and Jews Reject; Lie Says UN Reputation Largely Lost <a href="#e66" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c66" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">66</a></h3>
<p>[United Press International, Lake Success, 25th] United Nations circles believe that President Truman's call for a truce between Arabs and Jews in Palestine has little or no hope of success. The Arabs have rejected it, and the Jews are vague. However, a Jewish spokesman said: The Jewish position has been clarified on March 17, which is tantamount to saying that the Jews only support the partition plan.</p>
<p>Moreover, it is doubtful whether the US trusteeship plan can be implemented before May 15, and if it cannot, bloodshed will be inevitable. According to reliable sources, the US trusteeship plan is based on the hope that the British forces will slightly delay their withdrawal. There are even reports that the US ambassador has discussed this matter with the British government in London.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Lake Success, 25th] Council sources said recently that President Truman's unconditional support for the establishment of a trusteeship system in Palestine, and his request for a truce between the Jewish and Arab factions, have made the convening of a special session of the General Assembly inevitable. However, they also pointed out that the only factor that could cause the General Assembly to change its partition resolution would be a US guarantee to use US troops to implement the trusteeship system when necessary.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Lake Success, 25th] United Nations Secretary-General Lie today admitted at a press conference that the United Nations organization has lost a large part of its reputation, and the blame lies mostly with the five powers. The United Nations was originally based on the cooperation of the five powers, so the five powers should do their best to find ways to cooperate. Lie also said that the US proposal to establish a trusteeship in Palestine was completely unexpected to him. The secretariat staff of the United Nations Palestine Committee have arrived in the Holy Land and have established good cooperation with the British authorities and the Jews, but the Arabs insist on their position and completely disregard the work of the United Nations Committee.</p>

<h3 id="e67">Authorities Hope Communists Surrender; 400 Listed on Blacklist; Nearly Half Arrested in Recent Days; Chairman of the Third District Silk Weaving Industry Union Turns Himself In; Tao Yunshan and Wife Only Realize They Are "Comrades" Upon Arrival <a href="#e67" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c67" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">67</a></h3>
<p>[This newspaper report] Since the municipal military and political authorities announced the cracking down on Communist institutions, several people have surrendered to the authorities as of yesterday. Of those who held important positions in the Communist Party, and whose names have been learned by reporters, there are currently only two people. One is Tao Yunshan, and the other is Jin Yunshui. Tao Yunshan is the Chairman of the Third District Silk Weaving Industry Union, serving as the secretary of a Communist branch, and also the nephew of Tao Baichuan, who is in the Shanghai Human Rights Protection Committee. After obtaining clues, the authorities went to arrest him, and initially only apprehended Tao's wife. Tao only knew that his wife was also a "comrade" after his wife was arrested, and surrendered himself to the police station. As for Jin, he was the first to surrender to the police station after the Taian case was cracked. His identity is said to be of the "municipal committee" level. Both Tao and Jin are very young, and are currently being detained in a certain institution.</p>
<p>It is reported that as of the 26th, the authorities have arrested more than 160 Communist elements based on the blacklist. Among them are several "municipal party committee members" and "district committee members" appointed by the Communists. More than 40 of the arrested criminals who are important have been sent to the Garrison Headquarters detention center by the Garrison Brigade. More than 100 others are being detained at the police station's various branches, and preliminary interrogations are being conducted separately. It is reported that there are about 400 criminals on the "blacklist," and more than 200 others have either fled or are in hiding. The Garrison Headquarters and the Police Bureau, together with relevant institutions, will continue to pursue them.</p>
<p>Mayor Wu specially received reporters at the municipal government conference room at 5:00 PM yesterday and made a brief report, stating that after the cracking of this case, the arrest of bandits began on Monday of this week, and the press was not invited to publish it until Wednesday. The authorities did not intend to announce the truth, fearing that the outside world would misunderstand the situation and mistake it for forced conscription, causing the families of those arrested to petition, etc. Therefore, it was decided to disclose it publicly. However, because this case is still in progress, some parts of the entire case cannot be revealed yet, and it can be fully released in the coming days. The documents of the Communist bandits arrested in this case have been examined in detail by various sectors invited by the municipal government. In recent days, several people have surrendered to the authorities. Today (the 26th), two more workers surrendered to the police station, which is of great significance to the development of the entire case. I hope that all the Communists listed on the list can surrender themselves so as to obtain a new path, and those workers who are not on the list can work with peace of mind and will not be embarrassed.</p>
<h3 id="e68">Tao Yunshan's Experience Joining the Communists <a href="#e68" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c68" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">68</a></h3>
<p>It has been found that Tao Yunshan secretly joined the Communist Party in Shanghai in 1941. At that time, he filled out a membership application and took an oath, so he was a quasi-Communist Party member, but he did not have a party card. After the victory of the War of Resistance Against Japan, the Communist bandits gave him the appointment of striving for the silk weaving industry union so as not to be controlled by the government. However, since Tao became the chairman of the Third District Silk Weaving Industry Union, Tao had a lot of contact with various parties in Shanghai, so the Communist bandits were extremely vigilant for fear of his turning around. Moreover, since the winter of last year, the Communist bandits have pressured Tao Yunshan to use economic struggle as a means to achieve the purpose of political struggle, but Tao opposed it, so the relationship deteriorated once. Since Tao learned of the Communist bandits' plan to destroy Shanghai by force, he surrendered himself to the police station a few days ago and confessed all the policies and routes of the Communist bandits. It is also learned that Tao Yunshan will publish a detailed confession in the coming days.</p>

<h3 id="e75">Newspaper Industry Association Urges Prompt Determination of Paper Allocation; Seven Representatives Took Train to Beijing Last Night <a href="#e75" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c75" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">75</a></h3>
<p>[This newspaper report] The Newspaper Industry Association of this city believes that the import quota of white paper for the fifth and sixth periods to be distributed to its member newspapers has not yet been approved. The board of directors was convened a few days ago, and it was specifically decided to send Li Zikuan, Chen Xun, Lu Guang, Liu Zirun, Sun Daosheng, Chen Daoyi, Mao Zipei, and other seven people to Beijing last night to petition the President of the Executive Yuan, Zhang. Here is an excerpt of the content of the association's petition:</p>
<p>"Since the government managed foreign exchange at the beginning of last year, this industry has relied on your generous assistance and has been allocated import quotas for white paper, which have been approved in order, for a total of four periods. However, the quota does not meet the actual needs of various newspapers in this industry, and the quota in Shanghai has been reduced. Therefore, we have no choice but to purchase from the black market to supplement it. The difference in price is many times more, which has burdened us and made it difficult to cope. The timing of the announcement of the approved paper quota for each period is also delayed. After this industry sends the purchase contract to the Import Management Committee and submits it, it takes a considerable amount of time to apply for an import license. During this slow process of handling official documents, the foreign exchange rate has been adjusted many times, causing the member newspapers to suffer a heavy burden that is foreseeable and unavoidable, affecting costs and prices. This difficulty is difficult to describe. Now, the fifth period purchase quota time is almost two-thirds over (February to April of the 37th year of the Republic of China), and the number of newspapers allocated is still nowhere to be found. In addition to hoping, we have inquired in many ways and learned that the import quota allocation office believes that the National Economic Commission advocates importing more paper pulp and must obtain its approval, making it difficult to handle immediately. The National Economic Commission has already drafted a plan and submitted it to your office for review. We believe that the self-sufficiency of newspapers is indeed a way to revitalize industry. This industry abides by national policies and promotes culture. We have no objection to this measure; however, this end industry believes that the current supply and demand situation must be taken into account. We must not wait empty-bellied for the autumn harvest, nor can we draw a cake to satisfy hunger, ignoring reality. It is found that more purchases of paper pulp for papermaking were originally planned to have a certain process. If it can be successful as scheduled, the output is still insufficient. However, to date, it has been deliberated for a long time, and the implementation plan is still vague. Foreign pulp purchases cannot be obtained in an instant, and even if the pulp arrives, it will be delivered to the factory for manufacturing, and there are various difficulties that must be resolved after a relatively long time. However, the paper stocks of the newspapers are running out and cannot be maintained. We have not forgotten that at the conference on February 7th, the National Economic Commission invited responsible persons and officials from the paper industry, the book industry, and the Industry and Commerce Guidance Office to a meeting at the Shanghai Public Training Alumni Club. A certain papermaking expert stated that it is still difficult to manufacture one ton of white paper with one ton of paper pulp. This statement should be based on the fact that the price of paper pulp is not necessarily lower than that of finished paper, which violates the original intention of saving foreign exchange. If we make our own paper, plus other raw materials, wages, factory costs, etc., the value of one ton of domestic paper will inevitably exceed the value of one ton of imported paper by a large amount. Such a price is beyond what the domestic newspaper industry can bear. As for the import of finished paper, it will take two or three months to arrive at the port after the contract is signed. The fifth period quota was originally for the application of various newspapers in February, March, and April of this year. Now, February and March have passed, and the quota has not yet been allocated. Various newspapers have no way to order it. Even if the quota is immediately allocated, it will not be possible to arrive in three months. At that time, how will the various newspapers continue to publish without interruption? This is a serious problem that makes this industry even more uneasy and frightened. Therefore, we have sent representatives Li Zikuan, Chen Xun, Lu Guang, Liu Zirun, Sun Daosheng, Chen Daoyi, Mao Zipei, and other seven people to Beijing overnight to appeal to your leader. Please uphold justice, consider the facts, and promptly urge the relevant departments to expedite the approval of the fifth and sixth import quotas for white paper. The amount that this association should be allocated should still be the original amount from the fourth period and should not be reduced. In order to maintain the continuity of the industry's business prospects, this association has described its grievances in detail and hopes for your kind attention. Everything that is not yet complete will be presented by the representatives. We cannot express our anticipation."</p>
<h3 id="e76">Lawsuit on Legislative Election; Part Not Withdrawn Awaits Retrial <a href="#e76" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c76" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">76</a></h3>
<p>[This newspaper report] Regarding the disputes in the legislative elections, Zhang Xiaosong, the chief executive of the Shanghai Election Office, was sued by Xie Renzhao, Ma Junshuo, Zhou Yizhi, Lu Meiseng, Zhao Zhimei, Xia Sungui, Dai Yun, Huang Minhou, and others, and filed a lawsuit with the High Court to confirm the election as invalid. The High Court was heard by Chief Justice Li Liangting yesterday morning. The plaintiffs Xie Renzhao and Ma Junshuo had already submitted a withdrawal of the lawsuit on the 6th of this month. In addition, the plaintiffs Zhou Yizhi, Lu Meiseng, and Zhao Zhimei also submitted a withdrawal petition in court yesterday morning, so in reality, there are only three plaintiffs, Xia Sungui, Dai Yun, and Huang Minhou. The defendant Zhang Xiaosong hired lawyers Jiang Pingfan and Huang Jiyuan yesterday to defend him in court. As a result, the retrial was postponed. Here is an excerpt of the main points of the defense: According to Article 37 of the Legislative Election and Recall Law, the lawsuit should be filed against the chairman of the committee or the election supervisor. Today, the plaintiffs have filed a lawsuit against the Shanghai Election Office and listed Zhang Xiaosong, who is the chief executive, as the legal representative, and have not filed a lawsuit against the chairman of the committee. This is unreasonable and should be rejected directly. Chief Justice Li has now postponed the retrial for the part of the plaintiff who has not withdrawn the lawsuit.</p>
<h3 id="e77">Zhou Yizhi and Others Withdraw Lawsuit; Mayor Wu Expresses Admiration <a href="#e77" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c77" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">77</a></h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Zhou Yizhi, Lu Meiseng, Zhao Zhimei, and others, candidates in the local legislative election, believed that there were some shortcomings in the election process. They filed a lawsuit with the court. It is now learned that after exchanging views, Zhou and others have voluntarily withdrawn the lawsuit. Mayor Wu expressed his admiration for them. The conversations between Zhou and Mayor Wu are recorded separately below:</p>
<p>Remarks by Zhou Yizhi, Lu Meiseng, Zhao Zhigong, and Others: Regarding the lawsuit concerning the local legislative election, we are all plaintiffs. Our intention is none other than to hope that Shanghai's electoral politics will have an opportunity for clarification and improvement in the future. We dare say that our motives are very pure. Within this past week, thanks to the enthusiastic efforts of Speaker Pan and Secretary-General Xiang of the Municipal Council, we also frankly exchanged views with Mayor Wu. It was decided that the municipal government would convene a review meeting to thoroughly examine the various shortcomings of the past. Simultaneously, a committee will be established under the municipal government to provide opportunities to study and improve electoral politics at any time. We all have our own professional positions in Shanghai. As long as our initial aspirations are realized, we will have a clear conscience and be able to offer some comfort to the voters of Shanghai. Therefore, we have decided to withdraw as plaintiffs. Mayor Wu expressed his admiration for Zhou and others' withdrawal of the lawsuit and issued a special statement: "Zhou Yizhi, Lu Meiseng, Zhao Zhimei, and other candidates in the local legislative election believed that there were some shortcomings in the election process. Therefore, they filed an election lawsuit with the court. After exchanging views, the misunderstandings were cleared up. Now I have learned that Mr. Zhou Yizhi, Lu Meiseng, and Zhao Zhimei have voluntarily withdrawn the lawsuit. This attitude of focusing on the matter and not the person is truly admirable. However, our country's implementation of democratic politics is still in its infancy. Research and improvement are necessary. In the future, an electoral politics research association can be established to recruit enthusiastic individuals to participate in discussions in order to provide suggestions to the government for technical improvements in future elections. I personally believe that when Shanghai holds various elections again, it will definitely achieve further progress as a result."</p>

<p>Yu Bingjian, Director of the Shanghai Telecommunications Bureau, made the following remarks yesterday regarding radio registration: "This time, we are ordered to urge all radio listeners to register their radios, specifically for the purpose of collecting statistics on the number of radios and understanding their distribution in various areas. The radio registration rules published in the newspapers some time ago were announced on January 20th of the 31st year. At that time, it was during the Anti-Japanese War, and the rules were drafted based on the situation at the time. The Ministry of Transportation is currently revising them. This urging of registration does not imply any restrictions or crackdowns. Currently, citizens are coming to apply for registration in extremely crowded conditions, and the bureau's manpower is limited, and filling out forms takes time. To avoid applicants having to travel back and forth, applicants can send a letter requesting registration. After the bureau fills out the certificates, it will send them to the applicant's nearest branch office for collection. This is more convenient."</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Yesterday's report mentioned that eligible young men whose reasons for exemption or deferment occurred after the application period last year can still apply to the Civil Affairs Bureau. Many eligible young men mistakenly believed that they could start applying for exemption or deferment for the 37th year, and flocked to the Civil Affairs Bureau to apply, causing the staff to be overwhelmed with explanations. The person in charge of the bureau explained the issue yesterday: The bureau currently only allows supplementary applications for exemption or deferment in the following circumstances: (1) Eligible young men who were not qualified to apply for exemption or deferment last year, but whose reasons for exemption or deferment occurred after the application and review period last year (for example, an eligible young man who had no reason to apply for exemption or deferment during last year's application period, but enrolled in a high school or higher this spring and can legally defer military service. If he is drafted at this time, he can submit proof from the school and apply for a supplementary review, and he can only defer military service after approval). (2) Those who applied for exemption or deferment last year but were ordered to submit supplementary documents because the documents submitted were not in compliance with the review. (3) Those whose applications were rejected but who had valid reasons for applying. Anyone who meets the above conditions can submit supplementary documents, stating the reasons, to the responsible保区 for forwarding to the Civil Affairs Bureau for review from now until April 3rd.</p>

Therefore, the bureau has sent personnel to various districts to conduct a re-examination of rice shops. It is reported that a small number of rice shops have been penalized by the bureau according to law for failing to send their instruments for inspection.</p>
<h3 id="e92">Municipal Government to Discuss Racecourse Property Rights Case Today; Owners Propose Exchange Conditions; Land Bureau Believes it Should be Mutually Beneficial and Equitable <a href="#e92" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c92" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">92</a></h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The issue of the disposition of the Race Club's property has not yet been resolved. The Municipal Government Council Office will convene relevant agencies at the Municipal Government at 2:30 PM today to hold a discussion meeting. The Municipal Council has also been invited to attend. It is understood that the Land Bureau has sorted and summarized the opinions of the Race Club and submitted them with its own comments for reference. The Land Bureau's opinion is that the Race Club's opinions can be summarized into four points: (1) The land proposed for exchange only refers to the grassy racetrack inside the venue, which covers an area of approximately 80 acres. It is said to be the Racecourse's primary property. The land requested to be exchanged for a new racecourse cannot be less than 500 acres. The expenses for constructing a new racecourse and necessary buildings will be paid by the government and deducted when the Race Club's property is acquired. (2) The Race Club's property, which is the land between the grassy racetrack and Huangpi Road, is approximately 57 acres (excluding the grassy racetrack), and the buildings (including the special grandstand office and other buildings) will be acquired by the government at a price agreed upon by both parties. (3) The land inside the grassy racetrack is said to be the property of the Shanghai Sports Foundation Management Committee. If it is desired to acquire this land, a separate contract must be signed with the Management Committee. (4) The land and buildings on the west side of Huangpi Road are said to be the property of the Jockey Club Co., Ltd. The company should be allowed to decide on its own to sell or otherwise dispose of it.</p>
<p>Land Bureau's Endorsement</p>
<p>However, according to the Land Bureau's endorsement, the first principle for recovering the Xizang Road Racecourse should be to recover the entire venue and all the buildings inside. Since the land and buildings of the Xizang Road Racecourse belong to four different groups, it seems that the persons in charge of each group should be invited to discuss together in order to solve the problem at the same time. Individual negotiations may be difficult to achieve satisfactory results. In addition, matters such as racecourse management rules, taxes, and police maintenance of order should be further studied based on the new mutually beneficial and equitable treaty and the laws and regulations of the Chinese government. There should be no special treatment because of the exchange of venues. Regarding this point, according to the reporter's investigation, the Race Club has requested: (1) The central government should definitely guarantee that the two relevant companies can not only resume business but also continue to hold irregular horse races without interference. (2) An agreement should be established to determine the limits for the payment of taxes and donations on horse racing revenue. (3) The directors of the relevant companies should be allowed to formulate all the regulations and rules applicable to horse racing. (4) At the request of the racecourse officials, the head of the police bureau must dispatch appropriate personnel to maintain the rules and order of the racecourse (there are other conditions, which are not listed in detail). It is understood that regarding the exchange of suburban land, the Land Bureau's endorsement seems to consider the original Jiangwan Racecourse the most suitable.</p>

The original text is as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Telegram to the Ministry of National Defense, "After the Communists undermined unification, the government clearly ordered the suppression of the rebellion. Relying on our comrades on the front line, loyal and courageous, shedding blood in front of us, trekking through mountains and rivers, suffering from the enemy's weapons, or working hard in the garrison, or winning famous territories, protecting the country and defending the people, the hardships are no less than the War of Resistance. Listening to the drums and thinking of the generals, swearing revenge in rags, at a time when the moth bandits have not been quelled and the suppression of the rebellion is urgent, we especially hope that the valiant men will achieve great achievements and achieve peace together, so as to comfort the hopes. Correspondingly, we represent the 4 million citizens of the city and request the government to forward a telegram to the national Communist Suppression soldiers on behalf of the council to express our condolences, to show loyalty and righteousness, and to express our admiration."</p>

<h3 id="e94">Pan, Chairman of the Military Service Association, Writes a Letter to the Citizens on Conscription, Emphasizing Both Lottery and Volunteer Soldiers, and Immediately Responding to the Call to Defend the Hometown and Protect Oneself <a href="#e94" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c94" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">94</a></h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The Military Service Association is scheduled to hold a regular meeting at its Tanggu Road office at 10:00 AM today to discuss the opening of the lottery for those drafted and the collection of resettlement fees for volunteer soldiers. In addition, Pan Gongzhan, chairman of the association, recently issued the following letter to the citizens regarding this year's conscription:</p>
<p>Dear compatriots: The conscription for this year in this city has completed all the preparatory work and indirect lottery procedures, and will officially begin implementation from April 1st. As the head of the public opinion transfer office and the military service association, I have spared no effort to refer to the actual environment and study the transformation in detail in order to not violate the central government's main purpose and to adapt to the special needs of the local situation in this city. The reasons for this process and the reasons why it must be handled in this way cannot be without the following points, which I respectfully tell to all sectors of the city:</p>
<p>Not Only Fair But Also Reasonable (1) The conscription of 6,000 soldiers this time is based on the principle of regular lottery and assisted by the mobilization of volunteer soldiers. These two are not only complementary but also take advantage of their advantages. Because the regular lottery is the foundation for the country to implement universal national conscription and establish military service. This method is not only fair but also reasonable. This city is the largest city in the country, and it cannot be an exception. It should also vigorously promote it as a model for other places. However, on the other hand, this city is the economic and cultural center of the country. In general, young people with enthusiasm cannot be deprived of the opportunity to volunteer to join the army and ask for orders to serve the country when they see the Communist bandits betraying the country and committing atrocities. Therefore, in order to take this into account, there is the current method of combining lottery and volunteer service.</p>
<p>The Henan People's Regiment is Worth Learning From (2) In order to strengthen the security of this city and give full play to the superior conditions of people and geography in combat, we have, after the group competition and discussion of the post-personnel meeting and the unanimous approval of the Reference Committee, firmly requested the Central Government to train the 6,000 new soldiers on the spot this time and allocate them to the newly created garrison brigade to protect this city, in order to meet the principle of guns not leaving people and people not leaving their hometowns. Everyone must know that suppressing the rebellion and suppressing the bandits is not only for the independence and freedom of the country and the nation, but also for preserving our own lives and property and the only way to survive by protecting the hometown and saving ourselves. Today, when the flames of war are everywhere, the citizens of Shanghai are still able to live and work in peace and contentment. This must be attributed to the bloody battles and heroic sacrifices of the soldiers on the front line. But if we cannot even fulfill our responsibility to defend our hometown, then that is a great shame for the people of Shanghai. The whole country knows that the Henan People's Regiment is a strong enemy of the Communist bandits. Based on their personal experience, they shouted the two calm and firm slogans of "seeking life in death" and "destroying property to protect property", and were able to kill bandits and protect their hometown, complete the task, and the Communist bandits were ultimately unable to step into Henan. It is hoped that the aspiring young people of this city can also be like the Henan People's Regiment, enthusiastically joining the army to defend our own hometown!</p>
<p>Collect Real Objects as Resettlement Fees (3) The collection and regulations for the resettlement fees for new recruits this year are not only fair but also thorough compared to last year's methods. In order to practice the principle of "those who have money contribute money, those who have strength contribute strength, and those who have more money contribute more money," this year's collection of resettlement fees for new recruits is divided into five levels according to the family's poverty and wealth for the draftees who participated in the lottery born in the three years from the 14th to the 16th year of the Republic. This is much fairer than last year's method of not distinguishing between levels. At the same time, in order to prevent the resettlement fees obtained by the new recruits from being affected by the depreciation of currency, we have adopted the collection and distribution of real objects. We believe that this will not only encourage young people with enthusiasm to volunteer more, but also enhance their enthusiasm for joining the army to protect the country and defend their hometown because their families have been settled and their lives are worry-free.</p>
<p>Compatriots: Now the military suppression of the rebellion is reaching the most tense stage, and the crisis of the situation has also reached the final juncture. We must recognize the purpose of suppressing the rebellion, which is to protect the lives and property of the people. If we do not want to sacrifice our own lives and property, then we must rise up in a timely manner and enthusiastically respond to the call to defend our hometown and protect ourselves!</p>
<p>Compatriots! Don't you see? Today, countless refugees are wandering in our streets without clothes or food in the bandit area. Before the Communist bandits arrived, weren't they living and working in peace and contentment like us now? Therefore, in order to avoid such a tragic encounter, we can only rise up, "those who have money contribute money, those who have strength contribute strength," "enthusiastically transport supplies," "compete to serve," suppress the Communist bandits, and complete the task of suppressing the rebellion and building the country.</p>
<h3 id="e95">Food Talk: Reviewing Rice Distribution Work, Generally Worthy of Comfort <a href="#e95" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c95" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">95</a></h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] City Council Speaker Pan invited Ren Xianqun, chairman of the People's Food Allocation Committee, Ji Mingzhai, chief of the Grain Section of the Social Affairs Bureau, and more than 20 reporters to a "People's Food Allocation Talk" at the Council Hall on Tanggu Road at 10:00 AM yesterday morning. Speaker Pan first made a speech, briefly stating: The distribution and sale of rice in March is about to end. In order to seek improvement from experience, we have invited you to review the initial trial situation.</p>
<p>The Effect is Extremely Obvious</p>
<p>Ren Xianqun then reported on the implementation of the current food allocation according to the number of people, saying: The main tasks of this rice distribution are: (1) To promote a new economic system and obtain a fair and reasonable distribution. (2) As a preliminary work to stabilize the economy, the People's Food Allocation Committee is not a relief agency, and the set price cannot be too far from the market price. In terms of wholesale rice prices, the increase rate has been only 16.8%, and the retail price has increased by 8.3%, which is far from other prices, and the effect is extremely obvious.</p>
<p>Shortcomings Need to be Improved</p>
<p>However, there are also two shortcomings: (1) Initially, due to the lack of rice sources, the quality of rice varied. (2) The convenience given to citizens to buy rice before March 13 was insufficient. Ren said: We will try our best to improve in April, but what is allocated in April is American rice, and there are also three kinds of rice quality. We are currently studying the allocation method to give citizens a choice, or the rice price will be priced and sold separately according to the rice quality, and the rice distribution certificate will be issued at the end of this month.</p>
<p>Future Efforts</p>
<p>Ren also said: The future efforts of the association: (1) How to continue this rice distribution work, (2) Gradually handle the distribution of other daily necessities in order to expand the foundation for stabilizing the economy. After Ren's report, reporters asked questions, and Ren answered them one by one. Speaker Pan also believes that this rice distribution work is generally worthy of comfort. The meeting ended at 12:00.</p>
<p>Last Day of Rice Sales</p>
<p>It is understood that as of the 25th of this month, the People's Food Allocation Committee has distributed a total of 391,392 dan, 3 dou, 9 sheng, and 8 he of rice. A total of 3,913,924 citizens have purchased rice, accounting for about four-fifths of the city's total population. Today is the last day to purchase rice in March, and citizens who want to purchase rice should go to the rice shops to purchase it as soon as possible.</p>

<h3 id="e97">The Current Situation of the Shandong War <a href="#e97" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c97" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">97</a></h3>
<p>[Our newspaper Jinan 23rd] Before the base area in the Yimeng Mountain area is destroyed, Shandong's importance to the bandit army is second only to the Northeast. The National Army recognizes this and has always focused its main force on the Shandong battlefield. Since the end of the military operation in central Shandong, the main forces of Chen Yi and Liu Bocheng's bandit troops have broken up into smaller units and moved south one after another, Shandong has had a relatively stable situation. But not long after, the situation in Shandong became turbulent again. Since the 10th of this month, the bandit army has taken advantage of the National Army's forces being scattered throughout the province, and the military leaders in various places are attending the War Conference and Study Session in the provincial capital, a time when no one is in charge locally to launch a new offensive.</p>
<p>This offensive began on the western section of the Jiaoji Railway, with the 7th and 9th Columns of Chen Yi's bandit troops as the main force, using a force of more than 62,000 people. Bandit troops in other regions have also launched harassment attacks to tie down troops. One group even sneaked into Licheng, 25 miles outside Jinan, on the 19th. Fortunately, the National Army hurried back, easing the tense situation somewhat. However, on the night of the 18th, about 20,000 bandit troops from southwestern Shandong, possibly from Liu Bocheng's forces, were discovered crossing the Yellow River from Jinkou and advancing to a place 40 miles away from Dawenkou, with the intention of cutting off the Tianjin-Pukou Railway. The military believes that the bandit army will launch a major offensive on the Tianjin-Pukou Line during the National Assembly in an attempt to influence domestic and foreign opinion, and judging from the current situation, Jinan will be the target of the attack. In fact, the provincial capital is enthusiastically carrying out all defense measures. "Defending Great Jinan" is not just a slogan in the local area, but an active action.</p>
<p>To understand the situation in Shandong today, one must have a basic understanding that the bandit army has always maintained the ambition to occupy Shandong. Despite the disastrous defeats in southern and central Shandong, it still maintains considerable troops and supply organizations in Shandong. Before January 1946, most of Shandong Province was in the hands of the bandit army, and Jinan was an isolated city. In January, General Wang Yaowu was ordered to arrive in Jinan, accompanied only by a few staff members. The main force was still on the outskirts of Xuzhou. At that time, the area eight miles away from the provincial capital was a frequent haunt of the bandit army. The staff of the provincial government were equipped with submachine guns at night to prevent accidents. In February of that year, the main force of the National Army entered Shandong and carried out arduous military operations in the Yimeng Mountain area. At that time, the bandit army in Shandong had made long-term preparations, dividing the entire territory into six military regions: Ji, Lu, Yu, Bohai, central Shandong, southern Shandong, Jiaodong, and coastal Shandong. They cooperated and responded very quickly. The troops left behind were the Chen Yi and Liu Bocheng bandit troops, which were known for their elite status. The regular troops were more than ten columns, not including the local militia. The National Army paid a considerable price in the process of winning. The capture of Li Xianzhou and the martyrdom of Zhang Lingfu illustrate that victory cannot be achieved by chance. By September of that year, the National Army had defeated the main force of the bandit army in the battles of Nanma and Linyi. The former seized their warehouse, and the latter defeated the main force of the 2nd, 3rd, 6th, 7th, and 9th columns, causing Chen Yi's bandit troops to suffer more than 30,000 casualties. In addition, the 1st, 4th, 8th, and 10th columns of the bandit troops were also hit by the National Army in the southern Shandong area. The National Army completed its mission of destroying the central Shandong base area, but it is regrettable that it was only a little short of being able to encircle and annihilate the main force of the bandit army, leaving behind the root of the disaster in Shandong today. Senior military personnel frankly stated that these were not command errors, but limitations of terrain and soldier stamina. At that time, Chen Yi's bandit troops, under the relentless pursuit of the National Army, were already abandoning their weapons along the way, changing into civilian clothes, and scattered deserters, unable to talk about having any will to fight. However, the soldiers of the Ou Zhen Corps, who were chasing and suppressing them, also broke their feet in the mountains, and some even died from overwork. Therefore, after this great battle, the bandit army was indeed dispersed and weakened, but it still remained in Shandong.</p>
<p>The next operation launched was the Jiaodong Campaign, which began in September and ended in December. In addition to destroying the bandit's Jiaodong base, the biggest gain was the recovery of Yantai, cutting off the bandit's most important maritime supply line. The southern section of the Tianjin-Pukou Railway also opened to traffic from Jinan from December and has not been damaged to this day. Recalling that when Chen Yi occupied the Yimeng Mountain area, he repeatedly said, "Spend the Mid-Autumn Festival in Xuzhou and the New Year in Nanjing," and thinking back to the serious situation at that time, it is not difficult to measure the contribution of General Wang Yaowu and other officers and soldiers to the country.</p>
<p>After these two major blows, in addition to Liu Bocheng's forces gathering crowds to flee south and disrupt the Central Plains, Chen Yi's bandit forces were still in Shandong. At that time, the 2nd Column in southwestern Shandong and the 4th Column in eastern Shandong still had a force of 120,000 people. In the past few months, they have been working hard to reorganize and replenish their forces. Southwestern Shandong is the most important base area for the bandit army, usually merged with Handan in southern Hebei and other places to become the most important base for the bandit army within the Guan today. In this area, they have established Jianguo University, Military and Political Academy, Ordnance Factory, and Clothing Factory, and it is also a training ground for soldiers. Last winter, they produced 300,000 sets of clothes here. In the past three months, they have trained more than 100,000 new recruits. This base has its own external channel because Xiaogang Yingzikou in northern Shandong is still under the control of the bandit army. Soviet ships often visit this port. The National Army has intercepted letters to and from, proving that this is a supply port for the bandit party. Military materials from the Northeast can be transported through Yingzikou to southern Hebei and western Shandong, and from there to the Central Plains and to the bandit troops north of the Yangtze River. Therefore, the role of southwestern Shandong is a bridge connecting the inside and outside of the Guan and the Central Plains, and its position is very important. The bandit troops left in Shandong have increased to eight columns after several months of reorganization and replenishment, with a total force of more than 210,000 people, not including local armed forces. These are the capital for the Communist bandits to disrupt Shandong today.</p>
<p>At present, the focus of the war is still on the Jiaoji section. In the battle of Zichuan, in addition to the National Army's efforts, the local teams showed the spirit and strength of protecting their homes. Shandong Province has been committed to organizing local armed forces the earliest, and now it has proved to have achieved considerable results. Senior officials in the provincial capital have two views on the battle situation around Jinan: One view is that the bandit army does have the intention of attacking Jinan this time, because their past retreat was only a "centrifugal retreat" in military terms, and the goal has not changed. The bandit army on the western section of the Jiaoji Railway and the bandit army crossing the river in southwestern Shandong have formed a pincer offensive and can attack Jinan at any time. What is especially noteworthy is that the target of the bandit army in southwestern Shandong is Dawenkou, and Dawenkou is the junction of the Second and Tenth Pacification Zones, which is a relatively weak point militarily. The intention of the bandit army is clearly to destroy the railway and threaten the rear of Jinan. The difficulty for the National Army is that it has to maintain a 250-kilometer transportation line from Jinan to the east and a 120-kilometer railway line to the south. Within its jurisdiction, there are many large cities that must be defended, so the troops are constrained and cannot be as fully mobile as the bandit army. The bandit party understands this, so this offensive was launched, hoping to cooperate with the Northeast battlefield. Its ambition for Jinan is indeed not to be ignored. Another group of people believes that Shandong has a tight defense, especially the outer works of Jinan, which cost more than hundreds of billions. With the strength of the bandit army in Shandong, it is not enough to attack Jinan. At the same time, the offensives in the western section of the Jiaoji Railway and southwestern Shandong cannot be coordinated in time. Therefore, the main purpose of the bandit army's attack this time is probably to obstruct the reorganization plan of the Shandong Provincial Government, and the attack on Jinan is just a smokescreen. However, both groups agree on one point: the bandit army has many tricks, and the place to defend is often not where they come to attack, but they prefer to attack places that the National Army does not pay attention to, so no area, including the provincial capital, can relax. Secondly, the bandit army has now put forward the slogan of "expanding the army by a million and collecting ten thousand grains," and its ambition is self-evident. On the day its strength matures, with Shandong's important position, it will inevitably bear the brunt, and only the coordinated efforts of the military and the government can overcome the great disaster to come (Our reporter Ding Weidong)</p>
<h3 id="e98">Zhejiang Province's Seven Administrative Regions Implement Merger into Six Regions, All Pacification Zones Abolished from April <a href="#e98" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c98" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">98</a></h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Hangzhou, 25th] In accordance with the needs of the current war, the Zhejiang Provincial Government re-planned the original seven administrative regions, merging them into six regions, placing Hangxian, Xiaoshan, and Haining counties directly under the province. The six counties of Jiaxing, Jiashan, Pinghu, Haiyan, Tongxiang, and Chongde in the original tenth district, and the ten counties of Wuxing, Changxing, Deqing, Anji, Xiaofeng, Wukang, Yuqian, Lin'an, Yuhang, and Changhua in the second district, a total of sixteen counties, were changed to the First District Special Office, which is still located in Wuxing, with Commissioner and Commander Yu Shuluan transferred to the post. The eleven counties of Shaoxing, Yuyao, Yin County, Dinghai, Zhenhai, Fenghua, Cixi, Xiangshan, Sheng County, Shangyu, and Xinchang in the original Third District, and Zhuji, a total of twelve counties, were changed to the Second District, with the Special Office located in Yuyao, with Commissioner and Commander Zheng Xiaoyin. The eleven counties of Qu County, Dongyang, Lanxi, Yongkang, Jiangshan, Jinhua, Yiwu, Pujiang, Nengyou, Tangxi, and Wuyi in the original Fifth District, and Pan'an in the Seventh District, a total of twelve counties, were the Third District, with the Special Office located in Jinhua, with Commissioner and Commander Li Shijie. Changshan, Suian, Kaihua in the original Fifth District, and Chun'an, Shouchang, Jiande, Tonglu, Xindeng, Fuyang, and Fenshui in the Second District, a total of ten counties, were the Fourth District, with the Special Office located in Chun'an, with Commissioner and Commander Yu Senwen.

The twelve counties of Lishui, Qing Tian, Longquan, Jinyun, Jingning, Qingyuan, Songyang, Yunhe, Xuanping in the original Ninth District, and Suichang in the Fifth District, and Wencheng and Taishun in the Eighth District were changed to the Sixth District, with the Special Office located in Lishui, with Commissioner and Commander Xu Zhidao. As for the former Commissioner of the Eleventh District, Wu Shoupeng, due to the abolition of the Special Office, he was transferred to the province as Deputy Director of the Reclamation Committee. In order to cooperate with the needs of suppressing the rebellion and building the country, it is stipulated that: (1) All Pacification Zones shall be abolished from April, and all work of the Pacification Offices shall be handled by the relevant Commissioners and Commanders, who may establish command posts at the original locations when necessary, (2) Each District Commissioner's Office shall add one or two Deputy Commanders, and add necessary personnel, to be filled by the abolished quotas. (3) The Administrative Inspectors and Commissioners of each district shall be responsible for directing local security and administrative supervision, and shall have the power to command and dispatch military police stationed in the district, submit requests for awards or punishments, or dismiss subordinate county-level leaders and handle military law cases.</p>

<p>Next month, plans to inspect the Ning Shao District</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Hangzhou, 25th] Chairman Shen met with reporters at 5 pm today to discuss the issue of public security in Zhejiang Province. He said: The bandit situation in this province is still unstable. Compared with other provinces, it is clearly less serious. This time he attended the Central China Pacification Conference, and the result of the meeting was that Zhejiang Province alone did not set up a Pacification Zone, which also shows that the public security problem is not very serious. The reason for this is that this province used effective bandit suppression strategies earlier. In the future, it will adhere to the three-in-one method of suppressing bandits, clearing the countryside, and organizing and training the people, and cooperate with the construction of pillboxes, village telephones, and highway transportation to vigorously promote it. With the cooperation of local gentry, the major Communist bandits can be defeated within half a year, and the scattered bandits can be wiped out within a year. The matter rests with people, and he eagerly hopes to realize his ideals. The re-division of administrative regions, the abolition of the Pacification Office, and the increase of the commissioner's powers are all aimed at strengthening public security forces to benefit the suppression of the rebellion and the construction of the country.

<p>[Our Newspaper Jiading, 25th] A tragic murder case occurred in Panjiaqiao, Caowang Township, in the county on November 18 last year. The deceased, Zhao Heming, was the manager of the Meihua Clothing Company at 520 Lin Sen Road, Shanghai. After the incident, the county's criminal police team, together with the 6th Inspection Brigade of the Shanghai Garrison Command, arrested a murderer named Xu Liangtu and transferred him to the local District Procuratorate. On January 29, the procuratorate filed a public prosecution. As for the main perpetrator Xia Shikui, the former Chief Procurator Mao Xiqing issued a non-prosecution ruling. The murderers Li Zhiwen, Ma Zhixiang (also known as Ma Qiang), Wu, etc. are still at large. Recently, the case was transferred by the Shanghai District Procuratorate to the local District Procuratorate, where the deceased Zhao Heming's mother, Zhao Shi, accused Xia Shikui of instigating murder and Ma Zhixiang and others of committing the murder. In order to understand the development of the case, the reporter specially visited Chief Procurator Zhang Shijie yesterday, who said: Regarding the part of Xu Liangtu, the trial has been held twice, and there are already clues. The daughter of Xia Shikui's great wife also testified in court, stating that on the day of the incident, Xu Liangtu borrowed a car from her father in the morning and returned it after 5 pm that afternoon. This alone can prove the seriousness of Xia Shikui's criminal suspicion. Chief Procurator Zhang also told the reporter that the main perpetrators Xia Shikui and Yuan Ayin (Xia's wife) have fled in fear of punishment. If anyone knows their whereabouts, they can write to the procuratorate so that they can be arrested and brought to justice as soon as possible.</p>

<p>After September last year, due to the difficulty in obtaining dynamite, TNT and domestic yellow explosives were used as substitutes. However, the poisonous gas was too strong, and it was difficult to dissipate in the long pilot tunnel, resulting in many workers being poisoned. There was an incident where sixteen people fainted within half an hour, and it was not used continuously. It was not until the dynamite arrived in December that it returned to normal. With the concerted efforts of all parties, the tunnel was opened and joined at the same time on February 29 this year at 8 am, and the center line, height, and deviation of the tunnel at the joint were only a few centimeters because they had been carefully measured and calibrated in advance, which showed the accuracy of the measurement and construction.</p>
<p>Several days before the closure, the director of the Tunnel Engineering Office, Mr. Lu, and the two engineers, Mr. Shen Zhangnan, and all the workers were in a state of extreme tension. Inside and outside the cave, day and night were indistinguishable, the lights were brilliant, and there was a red light everywhere. It is said that most people were so engrossed in their work that they forgot to eat, and they were so exhausted that they did not know what fatigue was. When the two sections were closed, engineers Shen and Zhang celebrated the successful completion of this great project and happily passed one of the most difficult parts. They especially stretched out their right hands and shook them enthusiastically at a place about the size of a human face at the closed place, and then kissed passionately for five minutes. The degree of their joy cannot be described in words. Director Yuan of the Hunan-Guangxi-Guizhou Railway Engineering Bureau issued a congratulatory telegram and ordered awards to all the contributing staff, praising it as the greatest event in China's railway construction since the victory of the Anti-Japanese War.</p>
<p>The tunnel project is huge and the pilot tunnel is too long, so 28 manholes and 3 car holes are built on both sides of the tunnel to allow pedestrians and vehicles to enter and hide when the train enters and exits. In order to facilitate the construction of the pilot tunnel opening project and to eliminate coal smoke when the train runs in the future, two straight guide wells are specially designed at the east and west ends of the tunnel. The east end is 230 meters away from the hole and is 40 meters deep. The west end is 200 meters away from the hole and is 17 meters deep. They were opened on June 11 last year. The east straight guide well is supported entirely by wooden bars because of its hard stone. The west straight guide well is lined with stone for safety because of the gushing spring water. It is not only strong but also spectacular. When our group visited this fourth largest team tunnel in the country, it took 26 minutes to walk through the cave, and there were no abnormalities. Everyone respectfully admired the engineers and workers who participated in the construction of this arduous project for their arduous and remarkable spirit. The pilot tunnel project and the straight guide well project can be carried out smoothly and successfully, in addition to relying on the great workers, but also from the Yunnan-Burma Road came two American No. 2 mountain openers, each with a ventilation machine storing 100 pounds of empty gas, starting the mountain opener and drilling into the hard, iron-like mountain stone, the two machines started at the same time, and can reach 12 meters per day, so the progress is rapid. According to Lu, the director of the Tunnel Engineering Office, the tunnel project has used 12 tons of yellow explosives and 4.7 billion yuan in expenses, and 240 working days for labor so far. One-half of the entire tunnel project has been completed. In the future, it will still be necessary to work hard to expand and bottom out the work and take the necessary measures. According to the current prices and labor costs, at least 50 billion yuan should be estimated before the entire project can be completed. That night, we enjoyed a rich night banquet in the Shaping Station, which was built on the side of the Great Tunnel of Gu Mengguan, a great building of ghost maps and divine work on the top of Yuntong Mountain, and then we carefully tasted Yun for fragrant tea with the engineers and listened to the various moving stories of the construction. This group of hardworking people who overcame the natural environment with their omnipotent hands was not only admired and respected, but also felt supremely honored.</p>
<p>At 8:00 a.m. on the 12th, the reporter group had breakfast at Shaping Station and then visited the</p>
<p>Shaping Bridge. The bridge is 100 meters long, with six piers and four holes. The bridge is 30 meters high, and the diameter of the air is 20 meters. The Guizhou-Guangxi Highway runs through the bridge. At present, 40% of each pier has been completed, but the required stone is far away from the mountain factory and takes a lot of work and time, which makes people feel strenuous. Then enter the material transportation path and arrive at the Diaowei Tunnel, which is 5 kilometers away from the Shaping Bridge. The area is surrounded by mountains and is desolate. Before construction, people rarely visited, and the ground was covered with thorns. After the engineering personnel arrived, the most difficult problem was the accommodation problem, and the food and drink needed had to be purchased by walking to a place more than 20 miles away. The tunnel pilot tunnel is 295 meters long, and the Dian work period is one year and two months. It has now been fully opened. Due to the lack of explosives, the expansion and bottoming work has been greatly affected. Although most of the eyes have been opened, it is still impossible to continue to proceed.

<p>[Our Bengbu Bureau, 24th] In recent days, Bengbu has seen a frequent influx of refugees. Every train on the Jinpu Railway is packed with refugees with gaunt faces and disheveled hair. There are also many small-time peddlers trying to make a living. The railway authorities find it difficult to control the situation. As a result, a tragedy occurred at Bengbu Station. Around 7:00 PM on the 23rd, as the 74th northbound mixed train on the Jinpu Railway was departing from the station, refugees crowded on the platform, preparing to board the train to the north. They rushed to climb onto the roof of the train as the wheels started to move, vying for space and creating chaos. Railway police tried to warn them of the danger and attempted to drive them away, but the refugees paid no heed and continued to scramble aboard. When the train passed under the overpass at the fourth track, the crowd on the roof was so dense that more than twenty men and women were struck by the bridge and fell. Their screams echoed, and blood was splattered everywhere, a truly tragic sight. Nine people, including Sun Baojun from Pixian County (including two women), were killed or crushed. Eight people, including Wang Guixiu from Kaifeng, were injured. That evening, the station sent people to take the injured to the railway hospital for treatment. The dead were wrapped in reed mats and taken to an open space to await inspection. Today (the 24th) at 2:00 PM, the District Procuratorate sent prosecutor Li Guozhen to the scene to inspect the bodies. After the inspection, the military station prepared coffins and buried the deceased.</p>
<h3 id="e112">"West Shandong Corridor" Completely Recovered: People's Lives are Bitter but Admirable and Lovable <a href="#e112" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c112" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">112</a></h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Xuzhou, 26th] The so-called "West Shandong Corridor," established by the Communists for many years, has now been completely occupied by the National Army. This corridor originally included the counties bordering Jiangsu, Shandong, and Henan north of the old Yellow River flooded area and south of the intersection of the Yellow River and the Grand Canal. Due to the repeated impact of war, the civilian population has suffered particularly heavy losses. Yongcheng in eastern Henan and Shanxian in western Shandong have been reduced to rubble, with no houses left standing. In the past year, the Communists regarded this corridor as a base for disrupting the Central Plains. Factories for military supplies, uniforms, and shipbuilding, as well as institutions for conscription, training, and replenishment, were all located here. They often hid more than two columns of troops within it. This time, the National Army launched a full-scale campaign of suppression, not only destroying all the Communist military equipment but also driving out the remaining Communists. Currently, the scattered bandits hiding in this corridor area are only two broken regiments of the Liangguang Column, responsible for river crossing operations, and the local bandits led by Li Xuhua, Shi Xiaozhao, Zhang Taisheng, and Zhu Shiyue. In addition to controlling the crossing points on the right bank of the Yellow River to prevent the Communists from returning, the National Army is also conducting extensive rural pacification operations to protect farmers during spring plowing. According to the collective opinions expressed at a symposium held by Dangshan Party and government cadres who survived the fighting and the Jinghu journalist delegation, the government should seize the current opportunity to completely eliminate the local bandits in the corridor area. The Communists' policies of seeking food, clothing, and soldiers all rely on the local bandits as vanguards and scouts. Eliminating the local bandits would eradicate the future threat of a Communist comeback. Although the people in the corridor area are now scarred and even eat wild vegetables and tree bark to survive, their hatred for the Communists and their determination to fight against them remains unwavering. After inspecting a corner of this corridor area, the Jinghu journalists deeply felt that the people are indeed suffering greatly, but they are not pitiful but admirable and lovable.</p>
<h3 id="e113">Legislative Yuan Routine Meeting Discusses the Organization of Special Criminal Courts, Leading to Heated Debate <a href="#e113" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c113" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">113</a></h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Bureau, 25th] At the Legislative Yuan's routine meeting on the 25th, heated debate arose during the discussion of the draft regulations on the organization and trial procedures of special criminal courts for suppressing bandits. Sun Jiulu, Liu Butong, Tan Tiwu, Liu Tong, Chen Ruxuan, Liu Zhiping, and others continued to express their opposition, arguing that such special legislation not only violates the principle of protecting human rights but also destroys the integrity and independent dignity of the judicial system, and does nothing to solve practical problems. Liu Kejun, Sun Ke, Lin Bin, Zhang Banghan, Chen Haicheng, Liu Zixun, and others argued that special criminal courts are a practical necessity. As long as the legislation is carefully crafted regarding their organization and trial procedures, the protection of human rights will not be affected, and it should be passed.</p>
<p>Sun Ke emphatically stated that we are currently in a period of turmoil and cannot view today's measures from a peacetime perspective. The Communists do not love the country, and there is no room for leniency or forgiveness. To endanger national security in the name of democracy is unacceptable. Ultimately, it was decided that the revised regulations on the organization and trial procedures of special criminal courts had taken into account the integrity of the judicial system and the seriousness of the trials, and were therefore amended and passed. After the Presidential Palace Organization Law was discussed and passed, Liu Kejun began to report on the three reviews of the case by the Legislative Committee, listening to reports from representatives of the Judicial Administration Department and the Military Law Bureau of the Ministry of National Defense, and the process of the amendments made. He briefly stated that in terms of organization, it was changed to a two-level system. In addition to establishing a number of higher special criminal courts in various places as needed, a central special criminal court would be established in the capital, with the higher special criminal courts under the jurisdiction of the Judicial Administration Department and the central special criminal court under the jurisdiction of the Judicial Yuan, parallel to the ordinary high court and the Supreme Court, respectively. As for the trial procedures, the proposed system of one-trial finality should be changed. In addition to allowing those sentenced to more than five years in prison to apply for review, it was also stipulated that prosecutors could apply for a retrial within a certain period of time if new evidence was discovered. Procedures not covered by the regulations could follow the special criminal case litigation regulations. After Liu's report,</p>
<p>Sun Jiulu took the lead and loudly called for the integrity of the judicial system and the independence of the judicial spirit, stating that he fundamentally opposed the establishment of special criminal courts. He said that ordinary courts could expedite the handling of Communist cases and impose heavier sentences without the need to establish separate special agencies. He urged the attendees to pay attention to the Shanghai Bar Association's opposition to the case and the criticism from domestic and foreign public opinion, and argued that the preliminary establishment of the Shanghai special criminal court had the suspicion of coercing legislation.</p>
<p>Liu Butong continued by pointing out that the dance hall disturbance case, the National Bank sit-in case, and the student unrest case in Shanghai were all ordinary events, but the security authorities wanted to hand them over to the special criminal court for jurisdiction, which would only create chaos. He argued that this trend had the suspicion of following in the footsteps of fascism.</p>
<p>Tan Tiwu criticized the measure as a backward step, taken at a time of constitutional government and disregarding the people's freedom.</p>
<p>Liu Tong also opposed the reappearance of special institutions in the judicial system. At this point, Liu Kejun explained again that the judicial system was extremely busy with general court cases, and that the organization and trial procedures of the special criminal court could be amended to protect human rights.</p>
<p>Liu Butong, Tan Tiwu, and Liu Zhiping emphasized that improving the efficiency of general courts was essential, and that setting up special criminal courts was unacceptable. They pointed out that even cases of heinous treason had not been handled by specially established courts.</p>
<p>Chen Ruxuan sharply pointed out that the name "special criminal court" violated the legal principle of the universality of justice, and that the parliament of a democratic country had never passed special laws. Only the parliament of an autocratic and dictatorial country would make such a decision that disregards human rights.</p>
<p>Chen Haicheng evaded the question of whether special criminal courts should be established and argued that special criminal procedures must be applied to Communist cases.</p>
<p>Sun Ke believed that there was a need to establish special criminal courts. His reasons were that the revised organizational regulations did not allow the establishment of special criminal courts to undermine judicial integrity; and that special laws were necessary due to practical needs, such as prohibiting speculation and smuggling. He also pointed out that the United States had special courts such as divorce courts and juvenile courts. Sun also said that the handling of treason cases by ordinary courts was after the victory, when the threat of traitors had been eliminated. The current target of special criminal courts is the Communists, and the Communist forces are currently rampant and cannot be ignored. We cannot be lenient towards those who endanger the country and the government.</p>
<p>Lin Bin pointed out the urgent need for special criminal courts in areas close to the war zone, where ordinary courts are often unable to handle the cases. If the military authorities were to take full control, it might be too strict and would not protect human rights. He advocated for more research on the organizational and trial techniques of special criminal courts and for careful legislation.</p>
<p>At this point, Liu Zhiping and Liu Butong again rose to deny any intention of being lenient towards the Communists and continued to oppose the separate establishment of special criminal courts, which would undermine the judiciary and disturb the people. Chen Ruxuan pointed out that juvenile courts were established because of the special mental and physical condition of children and were not comparable to special criminal courts, and resolutely opposed special legislation. However, due to the length of the debate, several committee members believed that the revised organizational and trial procedures had taken into account judicial integrity and the protection of human rights, and therefore proceeded with the discussion of the articles.</p>

<h3 id="e120">Soochow Law School Establishes International Law Group This Semester <a href="#e120" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c120" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">120</a></h3>
<p>[Shenzhou News Agency] Dr. Sheng Zhenwei, Dean of the Soochow University Law School in this city, was commissioned by the Legislative Yuan last year to travel abroad for research. He has returned to China this spring to resume his duties in the Law School and, based on his research experience, is determined to make improvements starting this semester. Dean Sheng told reporters yesterday that in the past ten years, European and American countries have recognized law as a very important vocational education, so they have established law schools independently, without attaching "Political Science" or "Economics" departments. In general, the content of the courses, administrative law and tax law, has been changed from elective to required courses. In addition to the judicial field, special attention is paid to the cultivation of first-class international political leaders. The United States has now raised the pre-requisite system. Anyone entering law school must first complete two years of university courses. It is estimated that the entire study period will take about five years or more. Soochow Law School will establish a new International Law Group this semester and hire senior figures in the judicial field, such as Guo Yun'guan, president of the Higher Law School, Cha Liangjian, president of the District Court, Chief Prosecutor Huang Liang, Director Yu Shuping, and Section Chief Sun Kui, to teach. Sheng has also collected more than a thousand copies of the latest versions of legal codes from sixteen countries, including the United Kingdom, the United States, France, Germany, and Switzerland, of which more than 700 volumes have already arrived and will be used to enrich library equipment. In addition, he is also in contact with five universities in the United States, including the University of Virginia, the University of Michigan, Northwestern University, the University of Southern California, and the University of Washington, to hire visiting professors from these universities to teach in China. Starting next semester, Soochow Law School will generally raise its standards and reduce the number of new students admitted.</p>

<p>[Our Nanjing Bureau, 26th] The Ministry of Education, because the "uniform subsidies" for new and old normal school students are issued at different times, making it difficult to handle, and because prices are rising and still need to be adjusted at any time, has resolved at the ministry's meeting that uniform subsidies will still be issued after the start of the academic year, as in the past.

<p>[Our Bureau] The Ministry of Education believes that the work of normal schools in guiding local education is extremely important and has repeatedly ordered that it be carried out earnestly. Most provincial and municipal education departments and national normal schools have complied with the orders and reported, but there are still a few provincial and municipal schools that have not done so or have failed to implement them effectively. Therefore, it has again issued an order promulgating the points for attention that normal schools should follow when guiding local education, urging them to implement them earnestly: (1) The organizational personnel resume list, instructor resume list, specific plan for guiding local education, calendar of events, and budget estimate for guiding local education expenses for the 37th academic year should be compiled by the department (bureau) and reported to the ministry by the end of April of this year at the latest. (2) The report on the work of local education assistance in each school should be filled out in detail according to the specific plan for guiding local education formulated by each school, and any printed books or research publications should also be submitted by the provincial and municipal education departments to the ministry for filing. The report on this work for the 37th academic year shall be compiled and reported to the ministry in two phases. The first half of the year should be before the end of July of the 37th year, and the second half of the year should be before the end of January of the 38th year.</p>

<p>The Ministry of Education Urges Provinces and Cities to Draft and Submit Reports as Soon as Possible</p>
<p>[Our Bureau] The Ministry of Education previously ordered the education departments of various provinces and cities to draft methods for recommending students to normal schools and junior normal schools, in order to ensure that normal school enrollment is universal and equal, and to take into account the place of service at the time of enrollment. The Ministry of Education now finds that some provinces have formulated methods for recommending students to provincial normal schools and junior normal schools but have not yet formulated methods for recommending students to county normal schools and junior normal schools; some have formulated methods for recommending students to county normal schools and junior normal schools but have not yet formulated methods for recommending students to provincial normal schools and junior normal schools; and some have not yet drafted and submitted the above methods. It has recently sent a telegram urging the education departments of various provinces and cities to draft and submit reports as soon as possible. Although municipal normal schools do not need to recommend normal school students by district, the Ministry of Education believes that they should also formulate methods for selecting junior high school graduates with excellent intelligence, physique, and morality in the city to recommend them to study in normal schools at the time of normal school enrollment, in order to improve the level of normal school students in various provinces and cities.</p>

<h3 id="e143">Varying Treatments for Institutions of Higher Learning in Various Regions Adjusted Separately, Ministry of Education is Submitting to the Executive Yuan for Approval <a href="#e143" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c143" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">143</a></h3>
<p>[Report from Nanjing by our newspaper on the 26th] Recently, the faculty and staff of Anhui University petitioned the Ministry of Education because Anhui Province's Hefei and Wuhu are all treated at the third level, while Anqing, where Anhui University is located, is treated at the fourth level, which is unfair. The Ministry of Education agreed to submit a request to the Executive Yuan for adjustment on their behalf. However, for similar requests, the Ministry of Education already has the case of Wuhan University being at the fourth level, while Changsha and Nanchang are at the third level, the National Teachers College in Nanyue, Hunan, being at the fifth level, while Changsha and Hengyang are at the third level, and Yingshi University in Jinhua being at the fourth level, while Hangzhou is at the third level, as well as Beiyang University in Tangshan being at the third level, while Tianjin and Beijing are at the second level. All of these are due to the fact that the cost of living is already high, but the treatment is reduced.

<h3 id="e148">Sugar Prices Fall Again and Again <a href="#e148" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c148" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">148</a></h3>
<p>The sugar market remained sluggish yesterday, continuing to decline. The guild quoted spot prices at 245,000 yuan for coarse white sugar and 250,000 yuan for fine white sugar, and 205,000 yuan for medium granulated white sugar, already entering the 400,000 range. Stack order transactions initially amounted to over 100,000 yuan, but slightly improved in the afternoon. Due to hindered sales to the north, the domestic sugar market was sluggish, and Shantou refined sugar was even weaker, with prices at 2.75 million to 2 million yuan, and small sales at 50,000 to 80,000 yuan. Diaoging was only 2.5 million yuan, 200,000 yuan less than Wednesday. Hainan red sugar was the cheapest, opening at 2.05 million yuan, down another 50,000 yuan. It is reported that at this time, rock candy is sold together with special cotton white sugar, but the sale of rock candy is very limited, making it difficult to sell, so some sellers in the market yesterday were reselling it at a discount of more than 10%, which can be described as extremely weak.</p>
<h3 id="e149">Rice Market: Both Arrivals and Sales are Scarce, Coarse Grains are Flat and Weak, Oil Market Turns Upward <a href="#e149" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c149" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">149</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the rice market was firm in the south and weak in the north, but the fluctuations were not significant. The People's Food Distribution Association sold Japonica rice at 3.4 million yuan in the South City Market, selling 510 stones, but in the North City Market, it was sold at a price reduced by 50,000 yuan (3.35 million), and it was less accepted. At the opening of the South City Market in the morning, the price was raised by about 100,000 yuan because the price had fallen too much the previous day, and the owners were unwilling to sell at a lower price. Moreover, the arrival of goods was still scarce. The owners tried to reverse the downward trend, but although the price was reluctantly raised, the sales route was still ordinary. Moreover, affected by the sale of rice by the People's Food Distribution Association, the sales route became narrower, and the market returned to weakness later. White Japonica was 3.55 million yuan, up 50,000 yuan, but the market was even weaker at the close, and there was essentially no difference from the previous day. In the North City Market, white Japonica and early rice each fell by 50,000 yuan due to sluggish sales routes. Yesterday, a total of 6,318 stones arrived and were sold in the north and south markets.</p>
<p>The flour market was initially firm but then weakened. The morning opening price had already reflected much of the decline, and the owners tried their best to raise the price, but with sluggish actual sales, the northern merchants did not accept it, and retail investors had limited appetite, so there was a lack of power to rise. The market declined later, and grinding was reduced. Old cars were ground flat, warships were 5,000 lower, and Red Bee and Jiancheng were 20,000 lower. Lilang foreign flour was delivered at 2.1 million yuan for 70 pounds. Bran fell by another 25,000 yuan, and the factory quoted a low of 2.1 million yuan for wheat.</p>
<p>Coarse grains saw a slight recovery, as they had fallen so much that they were below cost, and the owners could not bear to sell at a low price, so they tried to support the price. Oil factories absorbed more soybeans at low prices, and prices rose slightly by 50,000 yuan. Corn was also tightly controlled upon leaving the market, rising by 20,000 to 30,000 yuan. Red sorghum rose slightly by 50,000 yuan. Green beans were slightly sold in this street, rising by 50,000 to 100,000 yuan. Sesame supply turned quiet, and the market turned firm and stable. Raw peanuts were slightly displayed, adding about 100,000 yuan. Only selected green and red beans fell by 100,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Edible oil prices rose as raw materials such as soybeans rose slightly, and the owners also shouted higher prices. People's hearts had changed from weak to strong. Many people waited and watched for many days, and some took the opportunity to add to their holdings, so the market was still strong. Dachang and Xin and other factories opened soybean oil at 7.4 million yuan, and re-turned goods were from 7.3 to 7.35 million yuan, each rising by about 200,000 yuan. Raw oil was traded with an increase of 200,000 yuan, and then another 50,000 yuan was added. Qingdao Ji barrels of raw oil were 8.95 million yuan. Raw rapeseed oil, Dade Xin, first opened at 7.15 million, and then opened at 7.2 million with a large surplus, an increase of 200,000 yuan. Small car vegetable oil rose by 150,000 yuan, and soybean cake rose by 120,000 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e150">Communications Bank Formulates Loan Plan to Assist in Coal Production Increase <a href="#e150" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c150" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">150</a></h3>
<p>Coal is the source of power for industrial production. At present, coal mines in Northeast China, North China, and Northwest China are either at a standstill in production or are hindered by transportation, resulting in a shortage of coal supply, which has a significant impact. In view of this, the Bank of Communications has formulated a loan plan to assist in increasing production and has drafted a loan plan for assisting coal production increase in the 37th year. The main points are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Loan targets: Major coal mines in the three regions of Central China, South China, and Taiwan will be given loans separately. State-owned coal mines include Jiangxi, Xiangjiang, Xiangshui, Yongshao, Nanling, and Taiwan coal mine companies, and their eight mines. Private coal mines are East China, Huainan, Zhongxing, Jiangnan, and Hunan mines.</p>
<p>(2) Loan methods are divided into working capital loans and equipment increase loans. All mine production is handled by the competent authority for unified distribution and sale.</p>
<p>(3) Loan amount: The estimated amount is 2757 billion yuan in national currency and 1.6 million US dollars.</p>
<p>(4) Loan effectiveness: The annual coal production of various mines in Central China last year was about 2.8 million tons. Production can begin to increase after the loan in July, and it can increase to more than 5 million tons by the end of this year. The supply of coal in the region will be barely self-sufficient. The annual coal production of the Nanling mine in South China last year was more than 20,000 tons, and the target for this year is to increase to 54,000 tons. The annual coal production of various mines in Taiwan was about 1.2 million tons last year, and production can be increased by 500,000 tons this year. The above will supply Central and South China.</p>
<p>(5) Smaller coal mines will be approved for loans individually at any time depending on the actual increase in production in the future.</p>

<p>Yesterday's cotton yarn market saw few new buyers active due to the approaching holiday, and procurement by customer groups was also sparse. Only arbitrage trading by exchange members remained active, keeping the market stable. The price of 42-count "Blue Phoenix" fine yarn initially jumped to 7,000,000, reaching 177,000,000 yuan. It briefly dipped to 3,000,000 yuan mid-session, but towards the close, strong players took advantage of the low prices to buy, pushing the price back up to 190,000,000 yuan at closing, a significant increase of 200,000 yuan compared to the previous day. 21-count "Double Horse" yarn opened at 109,000,000 yuan, and subsequently, as the financial situation of colleagues eased slightly, various groups also bought whenever they saw selling, causing the asking price to climb, ending at a high of 128,000,000 yuan, also a rise of 18,000,000 yuan from the previous day. 20-count yarns of various grades rose by more than 10%, while 16-count and 10-count coarse yarns also rose by varying amounts, from 2,000,000 to 5,000,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Yesterday's cotton cloth market opened with small amounts of replenishment from Shanxi groups, and customer channels in Xuzhou and Bengbu also absorbed supply, leading to strong buying interest. Simultaneously, shops also entered the market to buy. "Dragon Head" fine cloth rose directly from 3,950,000 yuan, breaking the 4,000,000 yuan mark again, with transactions reaching as high as 4,001,000 yuan. However, around 10:30 AM, cloth merchants began selling off, and shops also cut losses, causing transactions to become scattered, and the price retreated slightly to 3,980,000 yuan at closing. This was a rise of 10,000 yuan from the previous day, but a drop of 30,000 to 40,000 yuan compared to the off-exchange price of the day before yesterday. The final transaction price was at 3,950,000 yuan. The performance of other grades of fine cloth was mixed. In addition, serge, thick tribute cloth, fine twill, and coarse cloth softened by 30,000 to 40,000 yuan to 100,000 yuan, while the market for Shilin cloth and blue cloth remained stable.</p>
<p>It is also reported that purchase orders for "Dragon Head B" fine cloth supplied by the Fangjian Company were sold with a discount of 50,000 to 80,000 yuan, but towards the end, the price had to be increased by 10,000 yuan, hovering around 3,660,000 yuan.</p>
<p>[Our Dispatch] Yesterday (the 26th), Fangjian Company opened for sale cotton yarn as usual, totaling eleven types. There were 233 applications, totaling 575 pieces, equivalent to 908.5 pieces of 20-count yarn. The opening prices for each yarn were as follows: 20-count "Fairy Maiden" 107,000,000 yuan, 6-count "Deputy Sunlight" 55,000,000 yuan, 8-count "Sunlight" 57,000,000 yuan, 10-count "Lima" 59,000,000 yuan, 32-count double-strand "Fairy Peach" second-grade 143,000,000 yuan, 32-count double-strand "Harvest Year" 163,000,000 yuan, 40-count "Sunlight" 148,000,000 yuan, 40-count "TK Colored Ball" 183,000,000 yuan, 42-count double-strand "Colored Ball" 174,000,000 yuan, 60-count "Sunlight" 212,000,000 yuan, 60-count double-strand "Sunlight" (singed) 320,000,000 yuan.</p>

<p>Ten manufacturers in this city, including Dagong Dyeing and Weaving Factory, Hongda Yarn Tube Factory, Yongxin Raincoat Factory, Jinglun Shirt and Sock Factory, Dazhong Industrial Cooperative, Meilin Canned Food Factory, Standard MSG Factory, and Xinyi Pharmaceutical Factory, jointly organized an export promotion office on the 14th of this month at Room 75, No. 110 Sichuan Middle Road. Yao Junyuan and Xu Yu were elected as chairman and vice-chairman, respectively, and Wu Shuchen, Gu Shiqi, and Nuo Jun were elected as executive directors, with Qian Chengxu as manager. The office began operations immediately. In addition to handling the export affairs and procedures of the ten factories, the office will also seek to establish contact with major international import and export merchants and financial institutions to facilitate cooperation. It is reported that the office has already begun its overseas promotion work, and some results may be achieved in the short term. In addition, it also intends to suggest to the government the adoption of government procurement principles and the encouragement of private capital investment in industrial production. After the products are completed, the investors will be responsible for exporting them. If exports are unfavorable, the government will purchase them to prevent production from being interrupted.</p>
<h3 id="e153">Tea Market Fluctuations <a href="#e153" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c153" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">153</a></h3>
<p>The buying interest in both domestic and export tea remains strong from all parties, but the market inventory is still as scarce as morning stars, so holders regard it as extremely rare and are bent on hoarding. Prices have risen repeatedly. However, for certain varieties, amidst the general tightness of funds, those who are short of funds are rushing to sell, resulting in a situation that is somewhat ambivalent. In the end, the market remained at its original level. As for the pre-Qingming new Longjing tea of this year, which has always been valued by this street, since the first batch arrived in Shanghai from Wenzhou, Zhejiang, a few days ago, it has been in short supply due to the small amount of goods arriving, leading to a situation of "more monks than porridge." It is now understood that tea shops such as Tongtai Xiang are planning to send personnel to the production areas to purchase tea to meet the actual needs.</p>
<h3 id="e154">Industrial Oils and Fats are Remarkably Popular <a href="#e154" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c154" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">154</a></h3>
<p>Among industrial oils and fats, coconut oil has seen a very strong price surge in its origin area, Hainan Island, reaching as high as 15,000,000 yuan per dan. There is not much stock in Hong Kong, and major players who have it are hoarding it and not selling, so transactions are extremely rare. Soap factories are using fresh lard instead due to the high price, so the market for lard is also high. Tallow is also an important raw material for soap factories. Chemical industrial merchants are buying it to make toothpaste, etc. Local oil has risen to 14,500,000 yuan per sima dan, while Tianjin oil is at 14,000,000 yuan, but the cost of transporting it from the production area to Shanghai would be 19,000,000 yuan. Recently, due to tight credit conditions, the price is actually lower than in the production area.</p>
<p>Asphalt is also one of the raw materials for soap and candles. As other oils and fats rise, its market is also rising. Heben oil has been pushed up to 11,000,000 yuan per market dan. Other oils such as Caixuejian and sesame oil have also risen to 10,350,000 yuan, a rise of more than 10%.</p>

<h3 id="e156">Emperor Xuanzong of Tang's Policy of Stabilizing the Throne and Its Relationship with Yao Chong <a href="#e156" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c156" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">156</a></h3>
<p>— Wang Jian</p>
<p>One of the Micro-Studies of the Political History of the Xuanzong Dynasty</p>
<p>In this short article, only one point is discussed, the main purpose of which is to clarify that Emperor Xuanzong of Tang adopted Yao Chong's policies, stabilized his throne, and thus laid the foundation for the Kaiyuan Era.</p>
<p>(I)</p>
<p>To understand Xuanzong's urgent need for the stabilization of his throne in the early years, it is necessary to first know that there was a phenomenon of frequent political changes at that time. Let's take a look:</p>
<p>In the first month of the first year of the Shenlong era (705 AD), Zhang Jianzhi and others overthrew the rule of Wu Zetian and supported Emperor Zhongzong's restoration.</p>
<p>In the seventh month of the first year of the Jinglong era (707 AD), Crown Prince Chongjun plotted to kill Empress Wei and Wu Sansi, but failed because he could not enter the Xuanwu Gate.</p>
<p>In the sixth month of the first year of the Jingyun era (710 AD), Emperor Zhongzong was poisoned to death by Empress Wei. Empress Wei decided to make Prince Wen, Chongmao, the crown prince and became the Empress Dowager ruling from behind the scenes.</p>
<p>In the same month of the same year, Xuanzong quelled the rebellion of Empress Wei and supported Emperor Ruizong's enthronement.</p>
<p>At the end of the seventh month of the same year, Prince Chongfu of Qiao plotted a rebellion in the Eastern Capital. In the eighth month, he was pacified by Cui Rizhi, the magistrate of Luoyang.</p>
<p>In the seventh month of the first year of the Xiantian era (712 AD), Emperor Ruizong abdicated in favor of Xuanzong.</p>
<p>In the seventh month of the first year of the Kaiyuan era (713 AD), Princess Taiping secretly plotted a rebellion and was executed by Xuanzong. Emperor Ruizong retired to the Baifu Hall.</p>
<p>From the first month of the first year of the Shenlong era to the seventh month of the first year of the Kaiyuan era, it was only eight and a half years. In this short period, the emperor was replaced four times, and political changes occurred seven times. What a dangerous atmosphere! In such a turbulent political situation, how severe must Xuanzong have felt the pressure!</p>
<p>Why did the political situation at that time have such an undesirable phenomenon? The answer we might get is: "This was caused by Wu Zetian's political revolution."</p>
<p>First, the succession to the throne has always been a major issue in Chinese political history. The system of succession by the eldest son of the嫡 (di, principal wife), established by ancient sages and worthies, could not completely eliminate the desires of ambitious individuals in the royal family. The struggle between Emperor Taizong and Crown Prince Jiancheng during the Wude years of the Tang Dynasty, and the struggle between Prince Wei Tai and Crown Prince Chengqian during the Zhenguan years, were sufficient to show the seriousness of the issue of succession to the throne. Moreover, Wu Zetian's ascension to the throne as a woman further complicated the issue. Establishing a son or establishing a nephew seemed reasonable, so princes and relatives all participated in the power grab. Subsequently, Empress Wei, Princess Taiping, and Princess Anle also entered the whirlpool of disputes, the reason for which was also the realization that women could also hold political power.</p>
<p>Second, in order to eliminate obstacles to establishing a lasting dynasty, Wu Zetian had to overthrow the old ruling group. In order to meet the needs of governing the world and winning people's hearts, she had to adopt a new electoral system. Through her two methods of opening imperial examinations to select scholars and appointing people beyond conventional practices, Confucian scholars from old families and impoverished scholars were able to rise to the court through their literary talent. Unscrupulous monks and ruffians from the marketplace could also seek official positions through unorthodox channels. In this way, the number of people seeking official careers increased, and the factions in the court became increasingly prevalent. Thus, we can conclude: "Wu Zetian's political revolution affected the fluctuations of social classes at that time, and this change in social class created political instability in a short period after Wu Zetian."</p>
<p>Unstable courtiers had to attach themselves to an empress, prince, relative, or princess as their future backing. Ambitious empresses, princes, relatives, or princesses also had to gather a majority of courtiers as tools for political struggle. In this way, the union of factions had the secret seizure of the throne as its goal. As a result, the atmosphere of usurpation emerged from time to time. Wu Zetian initially started this frenzy, but in the end, her imperial power was inevitably swallowed up by this trend. At this time, Emperor Xuanzong of Tang's regime was actually generated in accordance with this trend, so of course, he had to pay attention to how to curb the resurgence of this wave.</p>
<p>(II)</p>
<p>In the first month of the second year of the Jingyun era (711 AD), when Xuanzong was still a prince, Yao Chong (then Zhongshu Ling, or Chancellor) and Song Jing (then Libu Shangshu Tong Jiacheng Shumen Xia Sanpin, or Minister of Personnel with the title of Deputy Chancellor) jointly proposed a policy to stabilize the crown prince, with the content divided into three articles.</p>
<p>First, send Prince Song and Prince Bin out to serve as governors.</p>
<p>Second, dismiss the left and right Yulin armies of Prince Qi and Prince Xue, and make them left and right officials to serve the crown prince.</p>
<p>Third, settle Princess Taiping in the Eastern Capital.</p>
<p>Originally, Prince Song, Chengqi, was the eldest son of Emperor Ruizong, and Prince Bin, Shouli, was the eldest grandson of Emperor Gaozong. Although they themselves might not have had any ambition to covet the throne, their unique status in the royal family could easily be used by conspirators as an excuse to launch political struggles. Therefore, according to Yao Chong and Song Jing's suggestion, these two princes had to be sent out as governors.</p>
<p>The key to the success or failure of the power struggles in the Tang Dynasty often depended on the allegiance of the Northern Gate Imperial Guards. Therefore, Yao and Song believed that Emperor Ruizong's policy of having his sons, Prince Qi Longfan and Prince Xue Longmeng, jointly command the Yulin Imperial Guards had to be changed at this time.</p>
<p>Princess Taiping was Wu Zetian's beloved daughter, and Emperor Ruizong's only surviving full-blooded sister. During the reign of Emperor Zhongzong, she had already been building a public party extensively. Since participating in the quelling of Empress Wei's rebellion, her power had become even more prominent. She inherited her mother's legacy, and her conspiracies and ambitions were very terrifying. Her repeated attempts to shake the Eastern Palace were an open secret, but her underlying intentions were probably far greater than this. Therefore, in the eyes of Yao and Song, only by letting her leave the capital could the safety of the crown prince be somewhat guaranteed.</p>
<p>Emperor Ruizong largely accepted these three suggestions and tried to implement them. However, except for the second one, which could be done smoothly, the other two actually encountered obstacles. The orders for Prince Song and Prince Bin to serve as governors were revoked after a few days, and Princess Taiping's trip to Puzhou ended in May. As a result, Yao Chong and Song Jing were accused of alienating flesh and blood and were demoted to governors of Jiaozhou and Chuzhou, respectively, on the day of Jiaxu in the second month.</p>
<p>On the surface, the frequent political changes since the Shenlong era ended with Xuanzong's campaign to eliminate Princess Taiping as a turning point. But in reality, the consolidation of Xuanzong's imperial power after this was probably due to several important measures he took in the early years of the Kaiyuan era. These measures seemed to have Yao Chong as their chief strategist.</p>
<p>After Princess Taiping was eliminated, in the tenth month of the first year of the Kaiyuan era, Xuanzong secretly summoned Yao Chong to the Wei River. At that time, he appointed him as Minister of the Army with the title of Deputy Chancellor until the twelfth month of the fourth year of the Kaiyuan era when he was dismissed from his position as chancellor. During these three years, two points are worth noting.</p>
<p>First: The first plan proposed by Yao Chong during the reign of Emperor Ruizong was realized at this time. The Old Book of Tang, Book Eight, Xuanzong Ji:</p>
<p>(In the sixth month of the second year of Kaiyuan) On Dingji day, Prince Song Chengqi, who was opening the mansion with the same authority as the Three Dukes, was made the governor of Qizhou, Prince Shen Chengyi, who was the Situ, was made the governor of Junzhou, and Prince Bin Shouli, who was the Sikong, was made the governor of Guozhou, entrusting the affairs to the upper aides. (Omitted) (On Yimao day in the seventh month), Prince Qi Fan, the Taichangqing, was made the governor of Hua (Jiang?) Zhou, and Prince Xue Ye, the Secretary of the Palace Library, was made the governor of Tongzhou. (According to the Tongjian 211, it also ordered Prince Song and others to enter the court every quarter in pairs, alternating continuously.)</p>
<p>Prince Shen Chengyi was Xuanzong's second elder brother, and Prince Qi Fan and Prince Xue Ye had participated in the campaign to eliminate Princess Taiping. These three, either because of their geographical proximity or their great prestige, were regarded as the same as Prince Song and Prince Bin. Since Prince Song, Prince Bin, Prince Qi, and Prince Xue could not stay in the capital for a long time, it was naturally difficult for a political revolution to rise again in the central government. In addition, Xuanzong allowed them to "entrust the affairs to the upper aides," in other words, he did not give them the real power of governors, so there was no need to worry about political revolutions in the local areas. This measure was actually more thorough than the suggestion Yao Chong had made during the reign of Emperor Ruizong. Yao Chong had proposed the suggestion of sending princes out as governors during the reign of Emperor Ruizong, and the sending of princes out as governors happened to be truly implemented during the period when Yao Chong was in power. Who assisted Xuanzong in completing this task? Isn't it very clear?</p>
<p>Second: The ministers who supported Xuanzong in eliminating Empress Wei and Princess Taiping were also expelled at this time. The Old Book of Tang, Book Ninety-Seven, Biography of Liu Youqiu:</p>
<p>Soon after, he was appointed Junior Guardian of the Crown Prince and dismissed from knowing political affairs. Yao Chong was always jealous of him, so he奏 (zou, reported to the emperor) that Youqiu郁快 (yu kuai, unhappy) in his secular, scattered position and had resentful words, so he was demoted and appointed as the governor of Muzhou. The same book and same volume, Biography of Zhong Shaojing:</p>
<p>He was promoted to Zhan Shi of the Crown Prince. At that time, Yao Chong always hated Shaojing's character, so he奏 (zou, reported to the emperor) that Shaojing's words were resentful, and he was demoted to the governor of Guozhou. (Mian? Guo?) The same book and same volume, Biography of Zhang Yue:</p>
<p>Soon after, he was framed by Yao Chong and sent out as the governor of Xiangzhou. (According to the case, Zhang Yue was sent to Xiangzhou from the position of Chancellor, and Liu Youqiu was also dismissed from the position of Chancellor and made the Junior Guardian of the Crown Prince at the same time. Liu's dismissal was related to Zhang.) The Old Book of Tang, Book Ninety-Eight, Biography of Wei Zhigu (can refer to the 次柳氏舊聞 (Ci Liushi Jiuwen)):</p>
<p>Yao Chong was deeply afraid of him and secretly added slanders, so he was appointed as Minister of Public Works and dismissed from knowing political affairs.</p>
<p>The Tongjian 211, Xuanzong Ji:</p>
<p>(In the second month of the second year of Kaiyuan) On Wuzi day, Youqiu was demoted to the governor of Muzhou, and Shaojing was demoted to the governor of Guozhou. Wang Ju, the 紫微侍郞 (Ziwei Shilang, a high-ranking official), who was on a military mission on the border and had not yet returned, was also implicated in Youqiu's party and demoted to the governor of Zezhou.</p>
<p>Liu Zhong, Zhang Wei, Wang and others all had merits in the two campaigns to eliminate Empress Wei and eliminate Princess Taiping, and they were all either dismissed from their positions as chancellors, demoted, or exiled in the end of the first year of Kaiyuan and the second year of Kaiyuan, that is, when Yao Chong first became chancellor. There must be a major background to this case, and it cannot be explained simply by Yao Chong's jealousy of merit. Originally, Xuanzong, during the period of his struggle for power, of course wanted to use them as wings and claws. Now that his goal had been achieved, and at that time there was a trend of members of the royal family colluding with ministers to launch political changes, of course he had reason to change his perspective and see them as poisonous insects and serious diseases. Here are two examples to illustrate:</p>
<p>The Old Book of Tang, Book One Hundred and Six, Biography of Wang Ju:</p>
<p>Someone奏 (zou, reported to the emperor) to Xuanzong, saying, "Those Wang Ju and Ma Sizong are treacherous and unrestrained scholars. They can be used to tread on danger, but they cannot be allowed to be successful. Now that the world has been settled, it is appropriate to seek pure and simple scholars who are versed in the classics." Xuanzong then estranged them. Although this matter may not be related to Yao Chong, it can be seen from this that Xuanzong had a psychological fear of this group of people.</p>
<p>The New Book of Tang, Book One Hundred and Twenty-Four, Biography of Yao Chong:</p>
<p>However, he was by nature treacherous. At the beginning, he was the governor of Tongzhou. Zhang Yue used to have a grudge against him and讽 (feng, indirectly advised) Zhao Yanzhao to impeach Chong. When he was in power, Yue was afraid and secretly went to Prince Qi to confess. Chong went to court another day, and the crowd rushed out. (Omitted) (Chong) said, "Prince Qi is His Majesty's beloved younger brother, and Zhang is a testifying辅臣 (fu chen, assistant minister). But he secretly traveled by car in and out of the prince's house. I am afraid that he will be misled, so I am worried about it." Therefore, he sent Yue to Xiangzhou.</p>
<p>This matter is related to Yao Chong, and it can also be seen from this how Yao Chong used Xuanzong's fear of ministers at that time to exclude dissidents. Moreover, Yao Chong's request to demote Liu Zhong was denied and questioned by both the正文 (zhengwen, main text) and the 考異 (kaoyi, textual research) of the Zizhi Tongjian, and his framing of Wei Zhigu's dismissal from the position of chancellor was also narrated very tactfully in the Ci Liushi Jiuwen. Probably later historians could not help but be somewhat biased towards this well-known sage chancellor. In fact, putting aside Yao Chong's personality, just in terms of his political achievements, Yao Chong's actions are a very important point in his career as chancellor. Because the foundation of the Kaiyuan Era was at least partially laid on Xuanzong's stable regime, and Xuanzong's regime was able to become consolidated precisely because of the two drastic measures of sending princes out as governors and demoting meritorious ministers in the early years of the Kaiyuan Era.</p>
<p>Finally, there are four points that must be explained in passing.</p>
<p>First, between the eighth and ninth years of the Kaiyuan Era, the princes who had been sent out as governors were successively recalled to the capital, and the demoted ministers were also partially re-employed. This was because Xuanzong's throne had become stable, which not only does not contradict the main idea discussed in this article, but can also mutually clarify it.</p>
<p>Second, the so-called ministers who supported Xuanzong in this article do not include the meritorious officials of the Longwu Army and the close attendants of Xuanzong when he was a藩王 (fan wang, a prince with a fief). The matter of the meritorious officials of the Longwu Army should be discussed in "The Commanders of the Imperial Guards during the Xuanzong Era."</p>
<p>Third, Yao Chong and Song Jing's presiding over the cessation of 斜封墨勅官 (xie feng mo chi guan, officials appointed by secret imperial edicts) and the closing of the road to seeking advancement through luck is quite relevant to the main idea discussed in this article, but because it belongs to the scope of clarifying the administration of officials, it is also omitted in this short article.</p>
<p>Fourth, Song Jing succeeded Yao Chong as chancellor, largely following the old rules. Regarding the task of stabilizing Xuanzong's throne, Yao Chong had already assisted Xuanzong in completing it beforehand, so although Song Jing also showed a tendency to suppress Xuanzong's old officials and meritorious officials, it can also be omitted in this article.</p>
<h3 id="e157">On “Song of West Island” with Mr. You Gu'en <a href="#e157" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c157" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">157</a></h3>
<p>— Ye Yuhua</p>
<p>The third issue of this publication (Shen Bao, December 20th) published Mr. You Gu'en's great work "Talking about Song of West Island," believing that the opening two lines of "Song of West Island": "Remembering the plum blossoms beneath West Island, Picking plum blossoms to send to Jiangbei," "is the tone of a man." It also says, "This poem begins with a 'remembering' character," so the entire piece is about a man living in Jiangbei remembering his lover. Only the final four lines: "The sea of dreams is vast and endless, Your sorrow is my sorrow too. The south wind knows my heart's intent, Blow my dreams to West Island," he believes "are more appropriate as a woman's tone." Mr. You also mentioned: "The woman lives in West Island, while the man lives in Jiangbei." Therefore, he further knows: "Since the man lives in Jiangbei, the woman's West Island must be in Jiangnan." This is how Mr. You interprets this poem. In my humble opinion, it is precisely the opposite. The entire “Song of West Island” is from the female character's perspective, she is thinking of the loved one who lives on West Island, and West Island is in Jiangbei. Judging from the situation described in the poem, she lives upstream of the river, on the south bank. She and her loved one met joyfully during the plum blossom season. After the loved one left her to go to West Island, it was not easy to meet again. When it was plum blossom season again, she "picked plum blossoms" and asked someone to send them to him. That's why it begins by saying:</p>
<p>Remembering the plum blossoms beneath West Island, Picking plum blossoms to send to Jiangbei. Simple dress of</p>
<p>apricot red, Double temples, crow chick color. My explanation of these four lines is this: Remembering the past plum blossoms when you (referring to the man) went downstream to West Island in Jiangbei, this time I specially picked plum blossoms and sent them to Jiangbei. When you see the plum blossoms sent, it is as if you see the former "simple dress of apricot red, double temples, crow chick color." Here, the first line says "West Island" is a place name, and the second line says "Jiangbei," referring to its location. From these two lines, it can be inferred that the female character sending the plum blossoms is on the south bank upstream of the river. The third and fourth lines simply mentioning "simple dress" and "double temples" is nothing more than hoping that the other person sees the flowers as if seeing the person.</p>
<p>Following "Picking plum blossoms to send to Jiangbei" with "Simple dress of apricot red, Double temples, crow chick color" seems disjointed at first glance, but upon closer examination, the importance of the three characters "apricot red" becomes clear. "Apricot red" describes the color of the plum blossoms and also resembles the color of the "simple dress," thus linking "apricot red" from the color of the plum blossoms to the "simple dress." Initially, it goes from the plum blossoms to the color of clothing, and then from the color of clothing to the appearance of "double temples, crow chick color," which is a very logical association. The entire poem is from the female character's perspective, with each line connected before and after, without any doubt.</p>
<p>If we interpret the opening four lines in the following way, it also works: "Remembering the plum blossoms beneath West Island"—thinking about whether the plum blossoms should be sent (the meaning of "下" is similar to "下書", meaning "to send") to you there, on the Jiangbei shore of West Island? "Picking plum blossoms to send to Jiangbei—Simple dress of apricot red, Double temples, crow chick color"—the person picking plum blossoms to send to Jiangbei is the one who used to wear an apricot red simple dress, with double temples like the color of a crow chick. The tone of the first line seems a bit uneasy, deeply afraid that something unexpected might happen and the plum blossoms wouldn't reach West Island, so the fifth line "Where is West Island?" immediately follows with an anxious question, and the following line "Crossing at the bridge head with double oars" says that one can go there with just "double oars," and the heart is slightly relieved. Written all the way through, the words are tactful and completely express the female psychology, so I think it is the female character's tone.</p>
<p>"Where is West Island? Crossing at the bridge head with double oars, At dusk the shrike flies, The wind blows the Chinese tallow tree." The above says "beneath West Island," this continues by saying "Where is West Island," and then says "Crossing at the bridge head with double oars," saying that although West Island cannot be seen, the "double oars" can send one to West Island. The mention of the "shrike flying" here symbolizes the meaning of separation and distance. At that time, the double oars at the bridge head are urged, you go to West Island, but where exactly is West Island? I only see the wind blowing the Chinese tallow tree, I cannot see West Island. What is the situation after separation?</p>
<p>Beneath the tree is the doorway, Through the door, exposed jade hairpin.</p>
<p>Opening the door, the lover does not arrive, Going out to pick red lotus.</p>
<p>The separation took place at the tallow tree in front of the door. After you left, I often looked out from the door for your return. Opening the door, I don't see the lover arrive, so I can only pick lotus to relieve my boredom. The following:</p>
<p>Picking lotus in the south pond in autumn, Passing the flowers over people's heads.</p>
<p>Lowering my head, playing with lotus seeds, Lotus seeds are as clear as water. Placing the lotus</p>
<p>in my sleeve, The lotus heart is thoroughly red.</p>
<p>This specifically elaborates on the matter of picking lotus, with endless emotion in the words. Since I cannot see you, I often miss you. So then it says:</p>
<p>Remembering the lover, the lover does not arrive, Raising my head, gazing at the flying geese. The geese fly all over West Island, Hoping for the lover on the green tower, From the tower, I cannot see, All day at the balustrade. The balustrade has twelve turns, Hanging hands bright as jade, Rolling up the curtain, the sky is naturally high, The sea sways empty green.</p>
<p>This says that the flying geese can still fly all over West Island, I can only climb the tower and look far away, watching the flying geese go by, unable to fly to West Island like the flying geese. So, stroking the balustrade in sorrow, rolling up the curtain to look into the distance, the swaying sea only increases the sorrow. Then, the final four lines follow:</p>
<p>The sea of dreams is vast and endless, Your sorrow is my sorrow too.</p>
<p>The south wind knows my heart's intent, Blow my dreams to West Island.</p>
<p>The end says that this vast and endless sea makes people sad, thinking that both you and I have this feeling. It is truly not easy to meet. I hope the south wind blows my dream clouds to you there, on the Jiangbei shore of West Island.</p>
<p>This kind of explanation seems much simpler, without needing to go in circles. The poem begins by saying: "Remembering the plum blossoms beneath West Island" is what the female character remembers, and in the middle, "Remembering the lover, the lover does not arrive" is also what the female character remembers, consistent from beginning to end. The "you" in "Your sorrow is my sorrow too" refers to the man, and "I" is the female character referring to herself, connected from the previous text in one breath, without needing to separate the two lines "The sea sways empty green, The sea of dreams is vast and endless," saying that the top line is the man's words and the bottom line is the woman's words. The "south wind" in the poem is the wind blowing from Jiangnan towards West Island in Jiangbei. What Mr. You believes to be problematic can all be easily resolved here, without needing to waste words. I have briefly written this out as I could at the moment, taking time out of my day, to solicit corrections from Mr. You. This explanation may have problems, I dare not dogmatically assert that West Island is in Jiangbei, and I still ask Mr. You to investigate. However, I would like to state that the river mentioned here should not be limited to the Yangtze River, there are many river names in the Jiang, Xiang, Wu, and Yue areas of southern China.

<h3 id="e158">Altruism · Interest · Selfishness <a href="#e158" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c158" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">158</a></h3>
<p>— Bo Yong</p>
<p>It's probably correct to divide all behaviors into the three categories mentioned in the title, right? The highest level is altruistic, the lowest is selfish, and being indifferent to the world is about interest. Ellis, a major British expert in sexual psychology (the one who wrote about sexual psychology), said in his book "The Dance of Life":</p>
<p>"The playful nature of the Chinese character and its culture is known to anyone, whether they only look from afar or get close to China. It has always been said that the Chinese invented gunpowder long before the Europeans, but it was only used for firecrackers and nothing else. In the West, this seems like a great mistake, burying the precious use of gunpowder. Only recently has a European dared to point out that 'the proper use of gunpowder is obviously to make firecrackers, creating beautiful things, and not to kill people.' In short, the Chinese can indeed fully understand this proper use of gunpowder. We hear that 'one of the most obvious characteristics of the Chinese is their love of firecrackers.' The most solemn people and the wisest are busy making firecrackers. If Bergson's writings were translated into Chinese - with many firecracker metaphors inside - we can believe that China would produce many familiar Bergsonians!"</p>
<p>Ellis is an eccentric person, and this passage can also be called an eccentric article. Under all heaven, there are people who express respect for the Chinese's senseless setting off of firecrackers, isn't that extremely strange and special? According to the Chinese, setting off firecrackers looks like it's for fun, but the real purpose is to worship gods. Worshipping gods means asking gods to help us get rich. For example, the God of Wealth probably wouldn't descend unless there were five thousand or ten thousand firecrackers, so every New Year you can hear stores competing to set off firecrackers. How can this kind of mentality be considered fun? The Biography of Humor in Records of the Grand Historian says that Chun Yufeng advised King Cheng of Qi to seek help from Zhao with a hundred catties of gold and a carriage of ten horses to repel Chu, with words like: "Now, I came from the east and saw someone plowing in the field beside the road, holding a pig's trotter and a wine cup, and praying: May the basket be filled, the cart be filled, the five grains be ripe, and the home be filled." Extremely expressing that "what is held is small, but what is desired is extravagant." This thinking can probably be considered to have been around for a long time. The slogan of "small investment, big profit" has been around since ancient times, and is even more so now! Not studying the means, but focusing on the purpose, then one should be a merchant but must be a fraud, and one should be an official but must be corrupt. This is all the difference of a single thought of setting off firecrackers to worship gods.</p>
<p>Therefore, China is a country that values ​​selfishness and self-interest. Some people are so indignant that they even say the words "China will not perish, there is no justice," although the principles of heaven are unknowable, the disasters of people are visible, and one cannot relax and act like Ah Q just because there is no perishing. Speaking of a playful attitude, the Chinese have never lacked it, but they are unwilling to use play for play itself, but instead use it for important state affairs. In ancient times, the owner of Banxian Hall lost the country by the cricket pot, and in modern times, there are those who lost three provinces in one night of dancing. Li Yishan's poem says it well: "Jinyang has fallen, no need to look back, let the king hunt for a while," and so, Xiao Lian's jade body was lying horizontally at night, and it had already been reported that Zhou Shuai had entered Jinyang! The Later Lord Li was never unkind, but specializing in flirting with the concubine-sister was not a proper thing after all, no wonder some people scolded him. In the days when the temple was empty, those who shed tears were only palace maids. Where was the ancestral artifact placed? We literary people often think that those who say these kinds of words are too demanding and don't understand human relationships, but speaking from a political standpoint, one must change one's attitude. Looking back again, the Chinese are serious and earnest about real play. During the warlord era, a game of mahjong could cause a big fight, or because you were a subordinate and held a white card so that the marshal didn't win under a full set, you would be reprimanded and even fired. Look, aren't our compatriots in the casino braver and more responsible than in the office? This is completely because they see —— that is, play —— as much more interesting than listening to sermons last week and reading newspapers and chatting in the office, so they go all out to do it. Just imagine if one day we could be so serious about things that benefit others, wouldn't there be a big turning point? It's not that we can't do it, it's just that we don't want to do it! We can't help but sigh.</p>
<p>Why are we willing to be serious about play? There are winning and losing relationships, that is, there are gains and losses for the self. Japanese and Americans both like to play mahjong, but in the Club, they see it like playing chess, ping pong, or billiards, not to make money. A competition of skills doesn't necessarily require money to be happy, but the Chinese think this is meaningless, "Why doesn't it make money? Boring!" Most people leave looking disappointed. Recently, playing cards emphasizes wild cards, completely overturning the previous skills of pure suit and great honors, requiring only speed and quick wins and losses, and doubling the payouts, which can fully realize the spirit of "small investment, big profit." This is truly a portrayal of the entire nation's morality heading towards speculation and trickery, and it is the prelude to the total collapse of social morality. Foreigners play bridge, which is to see a person's demeanor, bearing, mind, and skills, while the Chinese specialize in appreciating crab, Russian, and pai gow. What else can we say! Many ancient games have been lost, such as backgammon and equestrian chess. Thinking about it, it's probably because they were too technical and required too much brainpower? Go is no longer very popular today, and maybe after fifty years, even Chinese chess will be finished, or mahjong may also be eliminated. So, looking at it from these aspects, are we really as Ellis said, full of playful nature in our character and culture? Jimei was strict and Ba Shang was child's play. In contrast, the difference is clear. In fact, most of today's things are like Ba Shang, serious matters are treated as child's play, and child's play becomes serious. This reversal is not due to interest, but precisely because there is no interest. Generally speaking, our big problem is poverty. Poverty makes us want to desperately get money, and the so-called interest is chased away by the stench of money. How many people in the office today don't have stocks, cotton yarn, US dollars, and gold bars swirling in their heads? So it's no wonder that they see public affairs as chewing wax - assuming that these public affairs can't directly make them rich. What is incomprehensible here is that even people who have money and are very rich still have no interest. Zu Shishao loved money, could it be that their interest is only in the yellow gold bars?</p>
<p>People who don't even have enough interest, what else is there besides selfishness?</p>

<p>— Lei Hong</p>
<p>Hearing the news that newspapers are reducing their pages, I can't help but feel a vague sense of loss. In the years of war, we only see the gradual destruction of complete construction, and we do not see an increase in production volume, so people should eat two bowls of rice per meal, reduced to half a bowl or one bowl. In terms of spiritual food, this is the saving of paper. And the situation in China is even more pitiful, not only is there less paper, but the price of paper is expensive. Publishers feel that "finished products" are not as easy to maintain capital as "raw materials," and on the contrary, there is a risk of losing money. Therefore, the publication of books and newspapers is reduced as much as possible, delayed, and even enters a state of semi-stagnation, forming a phenomenon of cultural scarcity. Speaking of it, it is sad enough.</p>
<p>The situation in China is like this, and the Western publishing industry has also encountered the same situation, especially in the American magazine industry, which dumps to the world, even an embroidered pillow has revealed the straw core of decline. The Saturday Evening Post reduced its pages several months ago. Although the number of pages reduced has not been checked, it has changed from a thick book to a thin book, and the estimated total number of pages has been reduced by about a quarter. The novella that originally occupied one column has been deleted, and has been replaced by a novel that is continuously published in three or four issues. Collier's magazine has also reduced its pages in the same proportion, becoming a large "shallow" magazine. The situation seems more tragic than the "Saturday Evening Post".</p>
<p>American magazines originally emphasized both quality and quantity. Since the price of paper has risen in Luoyang and the printing cost has increased, on the premise of not wanting to increase the price to increase the burden on readers, they have had to emphasize quality over quantity, and have gone the way of deleting pages.</p>
<p>The Crown magazine, published in March, broke the tradition of not publishing advertisements, leaving a small part for some advertisers to publish advertisements, so that under the current economic exhaustion, it is a way to maintain the original level without increasing the selling price. I remember when Crown magazine was first born more than ten years ago, it was gorgeous and luxurious, and it could be called one of the best small magazines. After the war, in order to meet the general needs, Crown did not hesitate to lower its status and change its direction, becoming a "digest" type magazine that was not an excerpt, making it more popular and easy to understand. Recently, due to the times, it has added advertisements. Although the number of Gangwen pages has not been reduced, it can also be seen how the American publishing industry is struggling to make a profit in the thorny jungle of sales.</p>
<p>The situation of cultural scarcity is becoming more and more serious. If culture can bow its head in the economic environment, then I cannot bear to imagine what the even more tragic consequences will be.</p>

<p>— Chen Shenyan</p>
<p>Chapter 13: Trying to Remedy (110)</p>
<p>Xiao Bai paused and said: "You can't go either of these two paths. In the end, you can only go your own way and get divorced! The ending is so tragic, it's better not to plant the cause, so you won't bear the fruit. This time, I'm not trying to tear apart your good marriage, but because this marriage will never have a good ending. I'm breaking up this ill-fated relationship for you two. Now, Qiyun has gone to Shanghai to act in a play, so she has a way out. You don't have to worry about her. She will definitely gain both fame and fortune in the future. You should also move forward. You are a married man. You should cut out all delusions and go home to live a good life with your wife and be filial to your parents, so you won't let down my good intentions!" Zhu Zhai felt that sweetness, sourness, bitterness, and spiciness were intertwined in his heart. He didn't know if Xiao Bai's words were reasonable or unreasonable. His psychology was affected by his emotions, and he felt that Xiao Bai's idea was too poisonous. He just lay on the bed and kept crying. After a while, he asked Fan: "How did Uncle know about me and Qiyun? Who told Uncle?" Xiao Bai paused for a while and said: "Who doesn't know about this? No one told me, I heard about it a long time ago." Zhu Zhai said: "Did Zhang Yunqing tell you?" Xiao Bai bound his shoulders for a moment, paused for a while and said: "She is a young lady, how would she know about things outside! How can you suspect her?" Zhu Zhai couldn't say anything when he was asked. Xiao Bai said: "Don't think wildly. What Qiyun, what Zhang Yunqing, in short, none of them are your object. As the ancients said: A wife who has weathered the storm should not be abandoned, and your wife is very good. Hurry up and go back, I won't keep you here." Saying that, he patted Zhu Zhai on the shoulder and said: "You have to listen to me, you won't be wrong!" Zhu Zhai knew Xiao Bai's temper. If he asked him to leave, he couldn't help but leave. He had to stand up and say goodbye. He went out the street door and hired a car. His psychology was chaotic and mixed. He wanted to go back to the dormitory, and he also wanted to go home to see Feng Sheng. He thought for a while in the car, and finally decided to listen to Xiao Bai's words for the time being and go home to see what Feng Sheng's attitude was like. What Uncle Xiao Bai said was also right, a wife who has weathered the storm should not be abandoned. Feng Sheng has always been diligent and thrifty in managing the family. Originally, she had no faults. Because of Qiyun, I had the heart to divorce her. Speaking of which, it was still my fault, especially in the last two months, I didn't even send her monthly expenses on time. She didn't ask me in a questioning manner either. Her cultivation skills are indeed good. Her biggest problem is that she is not fashionable. Just now, Uncle Bo had also said that Qiyun is a fashionable woman who likes to spend a lot of money. Can I afford to support her? This is indeed the truth, I can't afford to support her, and I can't look to her for support. In the end, it will still be unfinished and end in bad results. It's better to stick to Feng Sheng, this yellow-faced woman, so that we can share the advantages and disadvantages and work together through hardships.</p>
<h3 id="e162">Reprimanding "It's Very Far" <a href="#e162" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c162" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">162</a></h3>
<p>— Nian Hong</p>
<p>Those who owe people money and want to get rid of it mostly don't say blunt and rude words like "I won't pay it back," but instead use the method of prevarication or delay. They clearly intend to owe it to the end, but verbally they always use phrases such as "I'll pay it back tomorrow," "next month," or even "in the future" and "I'll talk about it when I have it," so that the creditor has some hope of possible repayment, but this paper check can never be cashed even in the slightest.</p>
<p>Putting everything off to the future is indeed a clever way. Blind fortune tellers wandering around often say sweet words and embellish the customer's "tomorrow" with flowery words, allowing these down-and-out and frustrated people to immerse themselves in the beautiful vision of the future, temporarily forgetting the current pain, and finally voluntarily take out the only money they have and send it to the hands of the fortune tellers. Anyway, blind men do not bear any legal responsibility for whether the fortune telling is correct or not. If it hits, it is naturally fulfilled; if it is unfortunately wrong, then there is absolutely no reason to go back to the blind man to recover the fortune telling money.</p>
<p>What's more, after tomorrow, there is still tomorrow, and long-term checks cannot be written endlessly. Since the final conclusion has to be reached after the coffin is closed, then during the time of living, one can always continue to delay. This phenomenon seems to be very common recently.</p>
<p>For example, someone asked if China, as a country, would have a day of peace and prosperity? Although there are many answers heard, there are few affirmative replies. Most people think that there will be a day of peace and prosperity, but it is very far away, very, very far away. Twenty years later? No, no, thirty or forty years, no, no, maybe it will be even further away.</p>
<p>That kind of perfunctory saying that is close to owing a debt is really not worth a penny. Of course, the person answering will also give many seemingly correct evidences for the sake of supporting his "it's very far away" theory. Just like saying that the inferior nature of the Chinese people cannot be eradicated, the educational level of farmers is not qualified, the selfish atmosphere is difficult to shift, the feudal forces are deeply rooted... Things like that, it seems that he has really put in hard work and has a deep and unique study of Chinese society. But the listener believes it to be true, and so either is pessimistic and negative, thinking that it is difficult, it is difficult; or anyway, "it's very far away," what does it have to do with me, I might as well be drunk today and live a life of debauchery.</p>
<p>An anesthetic containing toxins is often exploited by people, so this theory has been spread very widely recently, replacing the "China will surely perish" theory, but it has also dampened the courage of people to face reality and work hard. The fact is very clear, long-term checks cannot be cashed, and now is no longer the time to be perfunctory and evasive. We know that if we put in one point of effort, we will definitely get one point of harvest. This harvest will not be in the distant future, but is right now. Anyone with a little historical knowledge knows that the strength of European and American countries is only a matter of the last few decades. Before the determined rectification, like the United States, the educational level and unity of these colonists who moved to the New World before and after the revolution were very backward and weak.</p>
<p>Everything, everything, lies in grasping today. The nonsense of "very far away" and "the future" which is a matter of the unknowable sky can be ignored, and we can give it a disregard.</p>
<h3 id="e163">Professor Commits Suicide <a href="#e163" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c163" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">163</a></h3>
<p>— Zhong Ming</p>
<p>According to a Reuters dispatch from Guilin on the 12th: Professor Du Su of National Guangxi University, due to poverty and illness, unable to make a living, committed suicide by jumping from a building in the hospital. This news has aroused sorrow and mourning in society. However, the most deeply affected are public education personnel, especially university professors who are in the same situation as the deceased.</p>
<p>Speaking of university professors, people generally have a sense of respect because they are the pioneers in the national education field and authorities in the academic world. Their importance is enough to influence the lifeline of national education. Before the war, university professors had a good life. Today, countries around the world are also trying their best to improve the lives and status of university professors. But what year is it today? University professors are actually in a state of "poverty and illness" and "unable to make a living," and in the end, they resort to suicide. It is really impossible not to cry aloud for the university professors across the country and the future of Chinese education!</p>
<p>A dignified university professor cannot even feed himself or support his children. How can he research anything good?</p>
<p>Professor Du Su's death is just a microcosm of university professors across the country and a signal of the crisis in Chinese education. The salaries of public education personnel will be adjusted next month. I hope that in the future, we will no longer see such heartbreaking news.</p>

<p>— Feng Xuexueyuan</p>
<p>I purchased a purple inkstick at Changdian, delighted by its uniqueness. On it were engraved white characters on a shaded background, saying "People grind ink, ink grinds people." Reciting this over and over, I was profoundly moved, and I believe it would resonate with those of us who pore over words. The poet Kenren once said, "What in this world makes people age? Half of it is the sound of carriages, half the sound of horses' hooves." This refers to the fact that people spend their lives chasing fame and fortune, running about busily. It is indeed a sobering thought, but it is a general observation. As for those of us who work with literature and art, we sit by our inkstones, using ink as our livelihood. We do not need to run around busily to make a living, so it seems that we are not bothered by the sounds of wheels and hooves. However, the writing implements before us are constantly being used up, and as we grind the ink, the time that is like an arrow flies by, never to return. Ink is an object, obedient to people. On the surface, "people grind ink," but in reality, the ink grinds people. Since my youth, I have immersed myself in the sea of words, and now I have white hair and a wrinkled face, and I am greatly weakened. Reading these six characters, I am filled with boundless sorrow and cannot restrain myself.</p>
<p>Since inkwells became popular, inkstones have been used less. Since there are specialized shops selling ink, selling by the bottle, and grinders are also in the trade, men of letters need not grind ink themselves. Since fountain pens and ballpoint pens have become popular in schools and newspapers, people often abandon Chinese writing implements and use foreign products even for writing letters and manuscripts. As a result, the use of old ink has gradually decreased. Roughly speaking, the users are: (1) calligraphers, (2) document departments of various government offices, (3) old-fashioned shops and old-school literati, (4) calligraphy classes in various primary and secondary schools, etc. College students all have ballpoint pens, and even when writing Chinese essays and taking notes, they rarely use Chinese writing brushes. However, when writing slogans and pasting propaganda, foreign pens are useless, and only writing brushes will do. The ever-increasing number of "wall newspapers" in various schools is actually helping native ink merchants maintain a portion of their business. It is indeed a way to promote national products, which can elicit a smile.</p>
<p>The value of antiques increases as their practical use decreases. Porcelain bowls, dishes, vases, and cups for eating and drinking, if decorated and treasured, become like waste. The same is true of writing implements. When I look at the ink catalogues of the famous ink makers of the previous dynasties, such as Cheng Junfang and Fang Yulu, their forms and patterns are varied, even including the sun, moon, stars, mountains, rivers, heaven, earth, people, ghosts, and gods. Reading through them one by one is like visiting a museum or reading the Classic of Mountains and Seas, forgetting that they are ink for writing. Merchants then try their best to imitate them, making the forms extremely refined and lifelike, but the quality is gray and渣, and they are absolutely unusable, completely "having the appearance but not the substance." If you question them harshly, they will honestly and impolitely say, "Even if it is real ink, many gentlemen only use it for display and not for practical use, so what does it matter if it is real or fake?" This remark can also elicit a smile and is also the truth. The addiction to antiques is originally a foolish hobby.</p>
<p>The "imperial ink" of the former Qing court and the specially made ink of artists were of course of extremely good quality in both literature and substance, but genuine products are becoming increasingly rare, and ancient ink from the Song and Ming dynasties is even more precious. The late Yuan Taishi (Lizhun, from Changzhou, a Jinshi in the Wuxu year) was most fond of this pursuit and collected many exquisite items. Banmeng mentioned in his letter yesterday that he recalled that when Wu Liuyu (Guanyin) was the chief editor of the Zhengfeng magazine in the 14th year of the Republic, he hosted a banquet for literary and artistic friends. Jiang Jun Yiyun (from Fujian, a well-known figure in the French Concession) was present and spoke of Yuan's collection of ink from the Northern Song Dynasty by Li Weiyi. Jiang Jun immediately wrote a short article that was published in Zhengfeng, saying: "Formerly collected by Wu Changshuo, later acquired by Yuan Juesheng. The ink is four cun six fen long, one cun six fen wide, and seven fen thick, weighing six liang three qian. One side is a picture of a red gate, with the words 'Valorous Family' written beside it. On the right side, a banana plant is partially visible within a enclosure, and a small hut is in the corner. A tall building rises in the distance, with golden rafters and vermilion pillars, incomparably magnificent. Outside are tall wu trees, with precise structure and ancient colors. The other side is a seal character with red gate, similar to the Daguan Post, imitating the style of Wang Xizhi, with a seal below that says 'Why Imitate the Ancients' in four characters. Two dragons coil around the edge of the seal. Comparing it with Shen Zifeng's (Zeng Tong's) book on ink from the Ming Dynasty, it is known that Li Weiyi was an ink official during the Zhenzong era, and his family had held this position for generations since the Southern Tang Dynasty. A small portion of the corner of the ink is slightly worn, like fine steel just emerging from the whetstone." It is not only excellent in form, but also extremely good in substance. This is a treasure. Being an ancient object that has passed through the Song, Yuan, Ming, and Qing dynasties, it is also worthy of admiration. However, when I read what Qian Mei of Meixi said about making ink, "The ancients said that brushes are better when old like grass, and ink is better when old like treasure. It is desirable for it to be a few years old, to slightly remove the fire nature. This does not necessarily mean that ink from the Tang and Song dynasties is considered old. Today, when people talk about ink, they always mention Li and Pan, or Cheng and Fang, and even each inkstick costs tens or hundreds of gold, but in reality, they are all useless. I have seen Zhijin Zhai's master and Liu Wenqing all use ancient ink, but they all smear the paper, as if it were stained with dirt. This is because ancient ink loses its glue, and when it loses its glue, it cannot be used, no matter how fine the smoke and how exquisite the packaging, it is only placed on the desk for decoration." This is a general theory.</p>
<p>My pursuit of this path is purely based on my interest and ability, and I have gained some small achievements. I obtained a square Qianlong inkstick (octagonal, with five hundred arhats, with five hundred different appearances. They have already been scattered, so I was able to obtain one or two at a low price, unable to seek completeness, and also not seeking completeness. I also obtained three of the one hundred views of the summer resort, all extremely beautiful and pure. I also obtained several inksticks of cinnabar ink and gold ink, with exquisite and playful patterns and styles. I am satisfied with this. I have never coveted ink from the Ming Dynasty or earlier, as I do not have the strength or the spirit.</p>
<p>The famous ink shop in old Beijing was Hu Kaiwen's, located in Liulichang, which still exists today. Their ink is divided into "Old Hu" and "New Hu." Old Hu are all products of several decades, and although they are not as exquisite as imperial ink, they also have artistic value. "New Hu" is inferior in both materials and workmanship, and is used by contemporary painters and calligraphers. The price is also not low, because this industry and this craft are becoming increasingly rare.</p>
<p>The reason why the ink industry of the previous dynasties was so prosperous was due to the imperial examinations, especially the palace examinations, court examinations, Hanlin examinations, examinations for assignments, and examinations for censors, chapter clerks, and secretaries, etc. Although these were examinations of essays, most of them judged based on the quality of calligraphy. Calligraphy did not need to be ancient, but rather elegant, luxurious, smooth, and even. The so-called "academy style" and "palace style" writing could not be accomplished without good brushes and good ink. The emphasis on ink materials, especially "pine soot," was because it was smooth but not floating, fine but not broken, black but not stagnant, and the characters written had an elegant and serene beauty. Those who have seen old "white folders" and "large scrolls" can all appreciate this to some extent. At that time, examinations occupied an overwhelming advantage, so the development of brush and ink crafts followed accordingly. This was an inevitable trend.</p>
