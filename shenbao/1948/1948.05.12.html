<h3 id="c19">如何善用美援 <a href="#c19" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e19" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">19</a></h3>
<p>自美國援華法案成立之後，美援如何運用的問題，各方面均寄以甚深的關切，當局亦正在縝巒考慮之中。這項援助，與我國財政，金融，物價，及農工商各業，均可能發生很大的影響。按照此項援法和中美換文，曁前日美總統請求國會撥款的咨文，美援的支配，可判明如下：（一）建設計劃即經濟性的援助，其總額爲美金三億三千八百萬元。其中又包括左列各部份：（一）臨時的初步辦法、即照中美救濟協定先行辦理，至本年七月三日止，其款由金融復興局墊支，以不超過五千萬美元爲度；（二）維持經濟二億七千八百萬美元，包括前項在內；（三）農村復興費用六千萬美元。（二）附加的即所謂軍事援助規定不超過一億二千五百萬美元。</p>
<p>以上第二種，　贈與性質，關於農村復興費用，規定「可用美金，或出售物資所得之中國法幣，或兩者兼用，」亦尚待美國提出具體條件來，與我國另訂協定。現在所最可注目者，爲第一種第二項的經濟援助，究作如何運用，其包含的物資，屬何種類。」</p>
<p>美國對華援助法案第四〇四款，只規定在一年內援助的金額，並沒有訂明是項金額，應以現金支付，或用物品供給，抑或兩者兼用。美總統日前的咨文中，雖指明作爲改進口主要物資，以維持中國經濟之用，但也沒有說明，這種款項，究係用現金撥付，抑將採購物資運華。據經濟調整專署宣佈：美國將先派調查團來華，策劃有關電力，鐵路，及開礦等工業復與經費之運用事宜，其歸援華代表團長賴普漢氏所監督者，尚包括糧食，油類，棉花，及其他工業原料在內，則知現金支付，至多不過其中的一部分，而大部份當屬於物品；所待調查，研究與協商者，亦即是這項物品之「種類及採購與分配之案件與方法」而巳。</p>
<p>因爲現金支付，至多只有一部份，爲數不大，且並沒有何等把握，所以改革幣制一層，除非另行商訂一筆貸款，否則便談不到。其物品項下，雖有上述糧食，油類，棉花，工業原料，及路礦電廠等擬議，但亦不過是一種預測，其具體的最後決定，當然須在中美商訂雙邊協定之時。</p>
<p>這裏所要先向大衆指出的，是無論現金或物品，其最後供給的援助形式，依然是物品。因爲提供現金，無非撥充外滙資金而外匯資金的支付，仍以採購貨物爲主，所以何項貨物，應予儘先採購，及各類貨物的數量，應如何合理分配，這是今日值得加以研究的課題。</p>
<p>現在外滙枯緊，限額太少，進口業與製迭業，均陷在極度的困難中；尤其是許多工業，因爲原料不繼，已在關廠，遷廠及减工，解顧之中。所以急其所急，我們願提供兩項原則：（一）消耗品除糧食外，應力求减少；（二）應置重點於亟待應用的原料品，及一切必要的器材。因爲照此辦理，可以維持許多搖搖欲倒的工業，和避免許多失業，以視單純的供應消耗品，爲有意義，其作用亦較爲積極而具有經久性。美國對華援助怯案，原說明：「這種努力，將迅速達成中國國內之和平及經濟穩定」，其代衰團長賴普漢氏，並曾表示：「凡能發展中國之生產，以及有助於置中國於穩定基礎之上者，即係尚準確之方向之一大步驟」。我們相信，上項原則，與友邦所抱防止經濟衰落之宗旨及方向究全　合。</p>
<p>至於美援物資在出售後所得之法幣現金，究作如何處置，這問題亦値得重視。按照中美換文，在初步辦法所供給的物資，係照救濟協定辦理的，（一）作復興，（二）除約定開支外，應專案存儲，候另行洽商。但聲明是項援助，其性質與救濟不同，今後經兩國同意後，其用途得予以變通。又在兩國換文中，美國並聲明：關於建設援助之資金，如須償還時，其條件留待日後決定。則除指充軍事用途之美金一億二千五百萬元，確定爲贈與性質外，其餘美援三億三千八百萬美元的物資應否償還，與如何償還，尚須待日後決定。不過日後縱須償還，或竟須全部償還，其期限總不至過促，在這短期間內，應不難商得同意，暫時運用，這是很明顯的事實。</p>
<p>這筆龐龐的現款，我們以爲指充下列兩項用途，最爲相宜：（一）彌補赤字財政彌補國庫的虧空，大家都知道：現在經濟上的最大癥結，無過於通貨膨脹，而通貨之所以不斷地膨脹，又無非財政上的收支不能相抵之故。所以運用這筆款項來彌補赤字財政，其直接的作用，雖在停止或緩和通貨的增發，而其間接作用，即在穩定物價，穩定財政，和穩定全盤的經濟；其所發生的積極的與有利的影響，應爲任何其他技節辦怯所不及。官方曾宣佈，現在流通的怯幣，只須美金一億元，便可以收羅凈盡，而將來所可變賣的美援物資，值到美金三億三千八百萬元之多，那麼，這個問題，應不難順利解決，至少在相當時期以內，總不至一味地乞靈於印鈔機罷！</p>
<p>（二）收購滯銷的國產品現在經濟上矛盾現象甚多甚多，如一面苦於物資的匱乏，而另一面却又患着生產的過剩，這現象表現在許多出口貨和茶某種製造品方面為顯著。原因是成本太高，而外滙又太不合理，使出口商皆陷於一籌莫展的苦境，無疑地將要影響到未來的再生產、與廣大農村的生計了。至於廠家的出品，如水泥，機器，　等，因爲其他工業太不景氣，銷路因而滯　，皆有進退兩難，欲罷不能之勢。在這種窘况之下，國家理應出來分別收購，以解救目前的困難，與保護工商的元氣。照法令說，現在定貨，購貨等政策並未失效，且有許多金融機關，在掌握物資的題目之下，正在展開這種手段，以囊括一切物資。無奈上舉這許多物資，皆是乏人問津的，無利可岡的，他們是否願意一視同仁，樂於收購，我們固未便妄加揣測。即使樂於收購，成照章定貨，其購貨定貨的墊本又從何而來？是不是要在轉抵押或重貼現的方式之下，依舊須中央銀行增發出大批的鈔票來？然則一小部分有關的工商家，固可以獲得融通，稍蘇涸轍，而通貨膨脹，物價飛漲的痛苦，却又要普遍地落到一般民衆的身上，這不是扶得東來西又倒嗎？，這筆美援出售所得的現款，並不從增加張行上得來，而且並不必增加因庫的負擔，如能撥出一部份來辦理收購，以徐待市面之好轉，似與穩定物價，穩定經濟的宗旨，並無不合。</p>
<p>目下各界對於美援的用途，有很多主張，如開發西南，開礦，築路，骰廠等等，這自然各有深切的意義。不過經濟界的杌隍不安的狀况，如果日深月重，不能予以有效的制止，則現有的已成事業，尚且岌岌不保，欲停不得，還看什麼增進與開發之可言？所以我們提出上面這許多主張。實有儘先注意的價值。</p>

<p>其次就金融方面說，目前大衆最注意的，是通貨膨脹應如何作有效制止的間題，不能避免的事實，發行遞增，由於國庫收支之不足，所以國庫收支之應力求接近平衡，實在是目前　不容緩的工作。再就發行增加指數與物價指數比較，目前發行增加指數，僅及物價上漲指數五分之一左右，物價指數超過發行增加指數五倍以上，其主要原因，實由於一般人心理錯覺所造成，只要政府有辦怯恢復人民對於貨幣的信任心，不去囤積貨物，不謀資金逃避，那末通貨增加對於物價的影饗，便不致如今日之甚。</p>
<p>最能影響人居對貨幣信心的，莫鍋於外匯市塲，財政部遵照政府政策，自廿七年起開始實施管理外匯以來，辦法迭經演變，也迭有改進，但就國際經濟情勢加以檢討，我們管理外滙，似乎還不够澈底，執行也不够週密。規在世界各國，除了極少數賽力充裕的國家以外，莫不實施嚴格管理外匯政策，使國庫貨幣價格與國外貨幣價格不發生聯繫，我國外匯資源本不充裕，加以產業落後，亟待自力更生，各種不必要的消耗，應該力求節約，所以嚴格管理外匯，實是目前推行經濟政策一種必要的措施。但是現在若干非必需的消耗品，至今尚在市塲普遍銷售，而國內可以換取外滙的若干種出口物資，反形滯銷。又如全國重要金融市塲之外滙黄金黑市買賣，雖禁令迭頒，猖獗如故，國外接近口岸各地，尤以投機商人逃避資金走私貨物的淵藪，尚未能切實隔絕，其對於國內的影響，這都是外匯管理的弱點，有待於各方協助共謀紏正的。</p>
<p>因發行的增加，物價的愛動以及外匯的管理未臻完善，而連帶引起的問題，是利率的高漲。本年三月間，上海市塲利率曾一度漲達月息大四分以上，最近盤旋於二分五至三分之間，內地都市有高於上海者，而農村利率尤爲高昂，職爭時期發行逐漸增加，物價不免波動，利率趨漲，原是自然的現象，但利率過份高漲的結果，對於農礦工商各生產事業，顯然有害，且因利率成本高昂，也必然促成物價上漲。卅六年物價上漲，平均爲十四倍，而利率成本的上漲約達八倍左右，這顯然說明利率高昻是物價上漲的主要因素了。尤其在農村現在一般農民習用實物借貸，其利率竟達百分之五十以上，此種高利貸，日趨普遍，必將促使大多數農民趨於破產，不但迭成經濟上嚴重的危機，而且要影響庶政的推行。</p>
<p>其他與金融政策關係最大的是金融機構的調整問題。我國金融機構繁多，僅次於美國，自三十六年二月政府頒佈經濟緊急措施方案後，限制增設新銀行，幷陸續淘汰不健全的金融機構，本年三月底止，全國金融機構共五九一二單位，內總機構二零九零，分支機構三八二二，如就性質分列，計國家銀行，省銀行，縣市銀行，及商業銀行四一四四，錢莊一一四七，信託公司三三，保險公司五八八，金融機構多數集中於沿江沿海各大都市，財政部曾多方設法促使移設內地，最近復在滬津穗漢四地設置金融管理局，管制行莊業務的經營，就目前一般金融經濟情形推論，限制坍設新機構以及將現有機構中資力薄弱或業務不健全的淘汰合併，似乎均屬必要。</p>
<p>上面簡單的分析，僅使提出目前財政金融重要問題的所在，從各種事實分析，可知目前財政問題雖然嚴重，但改善也幷不困難，只要全國上下同心協力，很容易在相當期問內扭轉機樞，平衡收支，重振幣信，安定金融的。個人管見所及，認爲下列數事特別值得注意：</p>
<p>第一財政政策與金融政策，應有一貫方針配合策進，不要計較小利，也不要顧慮困難，至於政府經濟政策和一般施政方針，也要和財政金融政策密切配合，特別在管制物價和扶助農業和工礦生產事業的發展方面，要有一致的步驟，彼此的措施，總要相助相成，而不宜抵觸矛盾。</p>
<p>第二爲求稅收的增加開支的撙節以及外匯金融的全般管制，必須全國上下，共同瞭解今日財政興革成敗，關鍵之重要，犧牲小我的利益，擁護戡亂的要求。凡是應該繳納的賦稅，踴躍輸將，應該栽减的經費，切實撙節，可以减免政府負累的措施，多方推動，有關各項必須管制事項的法令，共同遵守推行，尤其盼望民音機關和輿論界的支持。</p>
<p>第三現在憲政開始，今後財政金融之決策，應以民意爲依歸，但政策決定之後，應該責成主管負責執行，如能剷除障碍，克服困難，則財政改革，必可收效。（完）</p>

<p>— 本報記者　黃行天</p>
<p>〔本報餘杭賜璧塢九日訊〕五月九日，是天文界一個極可珍貴的日子，全世界的天文學者，科學家都滿懷興齊和希望，來　接這一次的日環食。</p>
<p>入我國境</p>
<p>環食帶始于印度洋東北部北經緬·暹·自廣東遂溪縣西南入我國境，經信宜·羅定·德慶·廣寗·吳德·翁源諸縣而入江西，經南雄·南康·贛縣·興國·南豐·資溪·上饒·玉山諸縣人浙江，經當山·分水·臨安·餘杭·德清路縣·又經江蘇吳江·海門二縣，再　黃海·越朝鮮南部，入日本海，經北海道極西北端、而終於太平洋東北角。其中在北韓四十度五十一分，東綫一三二度四十七分，當格林祺基標準時間二時卅分時，月影　項與地球表面最爲接近，相距僅有八公里，則可在飛機上看到短暫的日全食。我國全境除上列諸地外，皆見偏食，東南都份食分均達日面十分之九以上，愈向西北，食分愈少，但至新疆·蒙古邊境，仍可見到三分以上的偏食。</p>
<p>宇宙秘奧</p>
<p>日食是科學界探測宇宙奧秘的最　機會，它可以解答一部份科學上的雜題，也會產生許多新的問題。這一次的日環食，科學界所期望得的穫是：（一）利用日甚時的微弱光綫，觀察太陽四過有　新的行星；（二）從環食帶各點日食時間的參差，來推算地球的正確半徑和外形；（三）測定日食的初虧，日甚，復園的時間和食象。並附帶地測量日食時光度和溫度的變化。美國地理學會和軍部　爲了觀測這次日蝕　準僅得很久、特地派了七個觀測隊分布在環食上的緬甸·暹羅·中國·朝鮮，日本及阿留申群島（二隊），其主數目的，在利用　　機會，作大地測址，以謀得各國測量網的聯繫。我國中央研究院天文研究所也早就注意這次的日食，特和國防部測量局合組觀察隊，其工作有三：（一）利用八吋赤道儀之尋星鏡，配以可以左右上下轉動的木架，直接用照相機攝影，現測初虧，環食始終，復圓之時刻；（二）在同一底片上，每隔十分鐘攝一次，攝取自初虧到復圓之食象；（如卅年九月廿一日，在甘肅臨洮所攝者，在一張照相上可有一迎串的十八個太陽）。（三）利用光電管測定日食時亮度之變換。中美觀測隊的觀察站都設在　州四北四十三公里之賜璧塢。</p>
<p>美觀測隊</p>
<p>美測觀隊在四月九日即來武康　　二地覓取據點，結果推定賜　塢東埠岡頂上，拔海二六〇m．m，東徑一一九度五十分四四秒，北緯卅度廿六分廿五秒，距環食帶路差二千米。該隊由美國喬治城大學教授海登神父（Farncis　J．Heyden）領導，中央研究院天文研究所所長張鈺哲助理，攝影員格雷。（Joe　P　Gray）和二位助手卡斯脫林（Sargeant　Casteleans）　爾遜（LT．Nelson　Fay），他們帶有無綫電發報機，收音機，自記光度計，計時儀，定天鏡，裝有七五點五吋畏度三吋口徑望遠鏡的電影攝影機，和二個標準鐘（一對格林維基平時，一對當地平時）等儀器。中國觀測隊在三天前始趕到賜　塢，設站於東經一一九度五十分卅秒，北緯三十度廿六分十秒，在公路旁的山坡上，由陳遞嫣，陳彪主持，工作人員還有施士元·夏堅白·尹鐘奇·徐德祥·周家銀·江炳煜·楊學濬·共九位，他們的儀器比較簡陋，有二架定天鏡二支望遠鏡，一架照相機，和光度計等幾種，有的還是由日本轟炸機的描準器改裝配製的。</p>
<p>日出無望</p>
<p>餘杭本來不是個適宜的好地方，據陳　　先生說：一據我們所中的記憶，這裏在過去的九年中，祗有一個五月九日是晴天。」他說時，還是春陽和煦的好夭氣，可是九日晨四時許，我就被浙瀝的雨聲驚醒，雖不甚大，直到六時半才停下來，而陰雲層層，始終不散，但是張鈺哲先生們還是鼓足勇氣，爬上泥濘的山坡，到山頂上準備儀器。可是光陰飛逝，日出無望海登神父也祗好仰視着幽　　上的中國國旗和地理學會旗　息了，他們的工作，不見日就無怯做。山脚上的中國現測隊，也很洩氣，但是他們還是利用光電管來測定亮度的變換，這是他們唯一可做的工作，他們在初虧前，後各半小時時，每隔五分鐘記錄一次，在初虧前後各五分鐘時，每隔一分鐘記錄一次，在食甚前後各二分鐘時，每隔半分鐘記錄一次，以弧綫來表明亮度，結果測出初虧在九時廿三·四秒，十時四十九分廿五秒開始食甚，至廿八秒最黑，到卅二秒食甚畢，到十二時十八分十一秒復圓，和預算符合。（杭州紫陽山浙江省氣象所所算時間亦甚準，餘杭縣城之初虧爲九時卅分廿六秒八，食甚十時四十九分廿七秒五，復圖十二時十八分〇八秒九，）在初虧前和日甚最黑時，亮度的比例是五百比一。</p>
<p>可珍貴的</p>
<p>美國觀測隊在中國賜璧塢的觀測工作，因受天氣的阻碍而失敗了，中國觀測隊亦因同樣原因，設有觀測的成績但是有一點可珍貴的是便是由理論上推算出來的食時間，已和事實很相符合了，這證明了我們科學的進步。我國古代原很注重天象，書經「胤征」篇所戴日食，遠在紀元前二千一百年以前，是世界最古的日食記錄，到春秋時的日食記錄，巳很有研究價值，在二百四十年中，記錄日食，多達卅七次，且大部符合，這是很可貴的成績，希望十九年後的下次日食，我們自已底天文界有更優良的成質獻。</p>

<h3 id="c40">美蘇同意以直接談判方式　改善邦交樹立和平　雙方交換函件全文昨公布 <a href="#c40" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e40" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">40</a></h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕紐約十一日廣播：華盛頓訊，社魯門統統對史密斯大使向莫洛托夫所表示之見解，解釋爲美國政府重申其基本政策，以促使蘇聯政府之注意。此中絕無美國有改變政策之意義，亦無美蘇即將因此而有舉行會議之可能。此一行動，僅係重申美國之立場而巳。</p>
<p>〔路透社莫斯科十一日電〕蘇聯與美國業巳同意，以直接談判方式解決兩國間之一切糾紛·此一偉大的發展，係於美駐蘇大使史密斯與蘇外長草洛托夫交換之兩件於今晨發表後始行潘露。史密斯大使於五月四日函奠洛托夫稱，美蘇兩國間的目前關係，爲使美國人民及政府嚴重失里的淵源。就美國而言，談判以解決歧見之門始終洞開。莫洛托夫之覆雨答以蘇聯政府對於美政府企圖改進兩國關係之志願，採取積極的態度，對於以談判解決兩國間現有歧見的建議表示贊同。史密斯大使之函，並曰，美國人民之關切及決意，巳隨蘇聯對歡洲復興計劃所持之敵視態度而俱增。美國認爲此一歐洲復興計劃，不渦爲依共同基礎由美國援助歐洲之復興，亳不具有成脅任何人之意。</p>
<h3 id="c41">美政策堅定立移　對蘇絕不存敵視 <a href="#c41" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e41" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">41</a></h3>
<p>史巒斯之函，先提出下列諸點：（一）美國政府在國際事務中之政策，近來巳具有充分的肯定性，大多數美國人民莫不支持此一政策。美政府今後仍將以着力的方式，繼續施行此一政策，國內的政治狀態，如今秋美國之選舉等，對此一政策不具任何影響。美國政府深知各地之共產主義團體，正在宣傳美國即將發生的經濟危機，將　使美國改變其政策。宣揚此等言論者應知美國縱有經濟危機，決不致最響美國之工業能力，或其外交政策所基的急進因素。蓋目前國際局勢所牽涉的問題，對於美國的安全及全球的和平，俱有重大關聯故也。（二）美國政府願意明晰聲明美國對　蘇聯絕不員有敵視態度或侵略意向。美國相信如里蘇聯願與其鄰國和平相處，而不事企圖直接或間接干涉他人之事務，則美國之政策對　蘇聯之利益，決不致具有任何難以接受的影響。就事實上言，美國如無援助他國保護其政治完整之必要，以抗共產少數政黨奪取政權而建立俯首於外國利益的政權之企圖，則美國外交政策中之許冬因素，決不致引起蘇聯報告如此嚴重的抨擊。共產少數黨的此等企圖如果停止，則美國外交政策中引起莫斯科方而不滿的某種表示，白將不復需要。</p>
<p>史密斯之函，繼指出美蘇關係的目前狀態，乃造成美國人民及政府嚴重失望的原因。並曰「迄至目前爲止，吾人並未放棄改變政策，以謀恢復兩國良好關係，消滅國際局勢惡化原因的希望。就美國而言，談判與解決歧見的門戶，始終在洞開狀態之中。美國政府誠意希望蘇聯執政諸公，切勿忽視本函中所釋明之美國政策，不然，則美國決不缺乏自行努力，以在　蘇聯人民安全相符的條件下，穩定世界局勢的進備與志願。」</p>
<h3 id="c42">莫洛托夫覆函內容　聲明與盟邦訂約未附秘密條款 <a href="#c42" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e42" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">42</a></h3>
<p>莫洛托夫之權函有云：蘇聯政府業已獲知美大使五月四日函有關美蘇境狀的聲明。蘇政府對於美國政府改善兩國關係的志願，採取積極的態度，而對於開始討論解決兩國現在歧見的建議，表示同意。惟同時蘇聯政府亦有不得不聲明者。</p>
<p>美國政府所稱目前美蘇間不滿意的關係，及國際局勢之緊張狀態，係由於蘇聯在東歐所取政策及蘇聯勢力增張的一點，實非蘇聯政府所能同意。就蘇聯與其鄰邦及歐洲他國之關係口，蘇聯敢爲聲明此等關係自戰爭以來巳大有改進，此已有蘇聯與此等國家所締友好互助公約爲之證明。此等條約目的專在防止德國或其可能的盟邦再度發動戰略，決不附有任何秘巒條款。　蘇穚約各國固均會經德國之蹂躪，莫不亟欲締結此等條約。查美國政府亦在進行加緊其與鄰邦關係的政策，如加　大墨西哥及其他美洲國家等，其用意固深為蘇聯政府所諒解。故蘇聯之在歐港進行同一政策當亦不難了解，蘇聯今後當繼續進行加以其與歐洲此等國家關係的政策。</p>
<p>否認干涉他國內政</p>
<p>美政府之聲明復有美國政府在若干外國所取之某種引起蘇聯不滿的外交政策，乃係蘇聯干涉此等國家內部事務的結果等語，亦非蘇聯政府所能同意。查東歐若干國家戰後雖有內部重大的改革，然此乃防止新戰爭威骨的措施，並已因此造成此等國與蘇建立友好開係的有益條件。若曰此等民主化的改革，乃係蘇聯干涉其內政所致實屬完全錯誤，作此說者實屬忽略此乃民主勢力戰勝稍粹及法西斯主義的自然結果。東歐人民，固認此等改革，爲防止新戰爭威脅的保證，此等國家人民，認共產主義者乃反抗新戰爭最有恒心的鬥士，因此共產黨員之在此等國家內步登領導地位，並無足以詫與之處。實施民主改革之係國家的內部任務，固非任何人所得非議，然就美國政府之聲明觀，美國政府顯然特有與此不同的意見，且復允許對他國內政從事干涉，卒至不得不引起蘇聯政府餒重的反對，希臘之局勢，固確此等干涉之一例耳。</p>
<p>關係惡化　諉過於美</p>
<p>美國政府復日美蘇關係目前的不滿意狀態，係蘇聯政府對所謂歐洲復興計劃所持立塲之故。吾人於此不得不有所聲明者，如果歐洲經濟復興的問題不依此一所謂歐洲復興方案的方式進行，而以聯合國制度內以尊重國家權利反主權的原則爲基礎，本於國際經濟合作正常的條件進行，則蘇關對於眞正的歐洲經濟復興計劃，當不致持反對態度。蘇聯固爲戰時被創最重之國，對於戰後國際經濟合作之發展，自具有極度的關切與興趣。同時蘇聯政府並願聲明目前美蘇關係中的不滿意狀態，及國際局勢的緊張性質，實爲美政府目前所採政策之結果。美政府之在全球各地，包挿蘇聯毗鄰土地普建海陸空軍基地，而美國難紙及其政府若干官員復公然說明此等基地意在包圍蘇聯，更足以鼓勵當前國際緊張局勢之造成。美國此等步驟實不能以自衛爲藉口以自圓其說，亦豈得以國際現狀爲餅而對蘇從事各種軍事性的威脅。</p>
<p>蘇聯政策志在和平</p>
<p>反　蘇聯方面，蘇聯政府始終對美國及他國採取和平政策，在他國旣不建立軍事基地，亦不允其本身對任何國有所威脅。再者最近英法荷比盧五國已有軍事同盟之締結，蘇聯與東歐國家以及英法所締之一切互助條約，目的在防止德國再侵略，並未針對任何盟邦。然就西歐聯盟公約觀，其對象不僅在於德國，亦可針對二次世界大戰中之一切盟國。尤不可忽略者，乃爲西歐五國軍事同盟之成立，係因美國政府之主持而始獲實現。西歐五國軍事同盟顯然非以自衛爲目的之條約。</p>
<p>貿易歧視不堪容忍</p>
<p>再就美蘇貿易關係觀，美政際對蘇之不友好熊度，亦爲之充分顯示。根據美蘇貿易協定，美國對蘇聯輸出，祇能實　對任何其他第三國亦同樣施行的限制，但事實上美國政府目前所施的政策，對蘇繼出濫施歧視限制，則已直接　背美蘇貿易協定的規定。輪蘇物品雖已中蘇聯先付一部份甚至全部貨價，仍備受種種阻撓，其不堪容忍的性質實已顯而易見。今美國政府聲明對蘇並無敵意或侵路意向，希望建立　國良好關係，消除國際緊張局勢，並表示準備在與蘇聯安全相符的條件下，鼓勵世界局勢之總於離定。蘇聯政府對央政府此項聲明自表歡迎。　蘇聯政府之始終採返對美和平合作政策，及蘇聯人民之一致又持此一政策，固已人盡皆知。蘇聯政府並聲明今後仍當繼續施行此項政策，蘇聯政府並盼望得有方法以消滅現存的歧視，樹立美蘇良好關係，增強全球和平。」史密斯八使已允將英洛托夫之羅極，轉達美國政府。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕紐約十一日廣播：莫斯科訊，蘇聯人民對美國所提改善美蘇關係之建議，反應似頗良好。莫斯科電台對此項新聞，至少廣播二次。眞理報，消息報及勞動報等各大報均以顯著地位，加以揭戰，所佔篇幅甚多·美駐蘇大使史密斯今日赴怯，在渠赴機塲之時，大使館人員對於此事尚無所知，惟對最近史密斯與莫洛托夫會晤一節，則巳有所知悉。大使館中首先僅悉此項消息者爲史密斯大人，渠係自全印廣播電台之廣播中聽得。惟美國方面　察家對於蘇聯反應，不能遽表樂觀，良以蘇方之照會中力言蘇聯將繼續其鞏固對東歐各國關係之政策，猶如美國鞏固其對鄰國之關係然。</p>
<p>〔路透社倫敦十一日電〕美蘇同意討論解決兩國間歧見之消息公布後，倫敦人士均感歡欣·此間人士指出馬歇爾上週三向衆院外委會之陳辭時，業已透露美國頤依外交方怯與蘇獲取諒解之意志。馬鄉並認蘇聯目前之外交政策，係對西方國家之動機有所誤解所致。馬歇爾今所願者，即爲設法調整此一誤解。此問政界人士並信馬歇爾之對蘇接洽，係因鑒於柏林之危機日趨嚴重，將引起類似戰爭的局勢而發動。然倫敦人士並不低估美蘇利益趨於和諧的重大降難。猶憶前國務卿貝爾納斯於一九四五年秋外長會議首次破裂後，亦會力圖復活此一機構，其後外長會議雖告復活，然僅兩年之久卒文麺於破裂。</p>

<p>— 本報記者　章繩治</p>
<p>〔本報特寫〕一萬公尺決賽，爲大會田徑賽中的一幕壓軸戲，觀衆慕啞將樓文敖之名，而作壁上觀者，爲數約達八萬餘人。</p>
<p>此賽結果，樓文敖以卅二分四十七秒的紀錄，打破孫澈所造的卅四分一秒一全國紀錄，但較其本人最高紀錄卅一分廿七秒八的成績，則相差尚多。</p>
<p>樓文敖上次跑五千公尺時，曾經試穿過釘鞋，但是感覺到不大習慣，因此昨天仍舊改穿樛底跑鞋，可是結果依然沒有產生滿意的成績。樓文敖自從美國回來以後，似乎一直在精神不佳的狀態中。</p>
<p>分析摟文敖昨天成績比較差的原因：他在半途中受到幾個賽員的有意阻檔，實在影響最大。使他這部「長　機器」所保有的平均脚步，因此發生快慢不勻的情形，樓爲了要避免這種有意的阻擋，勢必加速脚步，從外圈繞道上去，因此「事倍功半」，無形中著去了許多氣力，更躭誤了卅秒以上的時間。</p>
<h3 id="c98">紀錄並不如理想　前半程尚可滿意 <a href="#c98" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e98" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">98</a></h3>
<p>據美國田徑指導的意見：認爲要樓文敖的時間縮短，基本的條件，第一步必須先改穿釘鞋，所以樓文敖在未能習慣穿釘鞋以前，要想他的萬公尺打破三十一分大關，事實上尚不可能。</p>
<p>如果在時間上分析：樓文敖要進三十一分關，那末每一圈（五百公尺）的平均紀錄絕對不能超過一分三十三秒，但是昨天他的平均數，每圈爲一分三十五·三五秒。除了最初三圈和最後一圈的成績是相當的水準以外，其餘的十六圈內，大部份都超過了一分四十秒。</p>
<p>比較的來說：樓文敖跑畢五千公尺時，他的紀錄是十五分五十九秒，雖較上次他在五千公尺的正式比賽中的十六分又五分之四秒略有進步，但是爲了創造新紀錄着想，這成績還不能滿意，至少前半程的時問應該在十五分三十秒以內，才是一個理想的紀錄。</p>
<p>還有一個原因：樓文敖向來跑慣四百公尺一圈的跑道的，因此他對於五百公尺一圈的距離和時問的計算，不不免失去了準繩和控制力，因此種種，終於使他的成績退了步。</p>
<p>如果撇開成績不講，那末樓文敖在昨天全賽過程中，他那輕鬆而富有彈性的大步，始終在一路領先壓倒羣雄的優勢下，尚不失爲一服興奮劉。</p>
<p>他拋落了第二名的靑島健將劉景理有四百五十公尺，更距離第三名老于有六百公尺，足使八萬多觀衆看得相當的過癮。</p>
<p>第四名是冀省于盛泉，他較老于又遲了大約三十秒的光景，第五名是台灣的陳萬生，至於聯勤的安本全，在苦鬥的情形下，搶得了第六名。</p>

<h3 id="c99">比賽全程圈圈緊張 <a href="#c99" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e99" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">99</a></h3>
<p>一萬公尺起步時，共有三十六人，比賽的過程是這樣的：</p>
<p>槍聲起處，樓文敖即用高速度搶出人羣，跑在最前面。七百五十公尺後，長長的行列，好像一連串的帶魚在行進　　將大跨步的在前面，其次是劉景理，虞慶，安本全，干希渭，于盛泉，陳萬生。</p>
<p>二圈半（一二五○公尺）：樓文敖脫出了大行列三十公尺，劉景琨和平希渭，陳萬生，煎後緊緊相隨，稍後爲安本全和于盛泉</p>
<p>三圈半（一七五〇公尺）：樓文敖領前了五十公尺，于希渭搶出劉景現，陳萬生仍歸位居第四，于盛泉開始越過了安本全。</p>
<p>四圈半（二二五〇公尺）：樓文敖行將開始接近了最末的幾個人，一時看台上掌聲雷動。那時于希渭劉景琨和陳萬生成了膠着狀態。到了五圈跑畢，樓文敖已經超出了最後三名。</p>
<p>五圈半（二七五〇公尺）棋文敖摜脫第二名有一百二十公尺，其餘的位置仍歸保持常態。</p>
<p>六圈半（三二五〇公尺）樓文敖更遠了四十公尺，于希渭和劉景琨爲了爭奪亞軍名次，兩人競爭頗烈。當時的情景好像樓文敖在表演，于劉兩人才是在比賽！</p>
<p>七圈半（三七五〇公尺）：樓文敖距第二名已經有二百公尺，劉景琨開始追出了干希渭，其餘名次大致無變更。</p>
<p>八圈半（四二五〇公尺）：于希渭仍舊搶到第二席，暫時壓倒劉景琨，至於樓文敖則愈跑愈遠，超出他們巳有二百三十公尺。</p>
<p>九圈半（四七五〇公尺）：一切維持原狀，無多大進出。</p>
<p>十圈半（五二五〇公尺）：樓文敖遠離大隊幾乎已有一圈。</p>
<p>十一圈半（五七五〇公尺）：第二名之爭，益見激烈，劉景琨再度越過于希渭，且更超出五米之遙。那時陳萬生，于盛泉仍分居第四，第五名。安本全則位居第六、全程至此，似乎大勢已定。</p>
<p>十二圈半（六一五〇公尺）：情形與前圈相類同。</p>
<p>十三圈半（六七五〇公尺）：樓文敖的速率始終沒有多大增加，而萬　　　顯然比前幾圈有生氣，于希渭漸漸地失去了爭奪第二名的勇氣，實告落後了二十公尺。最後，摟文敖開始追出了當時位居第五的于盛果。</p>
<p>十四圈半（七二五〇公尺）：無變吏。</p>
<p>十五圈半（七七五〇公尺）：樓文敖更追出了當時位居第四的陳萬生。</p>
<p>十六圈半（八二五〇公尺）：前三名大勢已定，原居第四位的台灣選手陳萬生，速度漸漸减低，反之，河北于盛泉後勁甚足，有後來居上之勢。</p>
<p>十七圈半八（七五〇公尺）：陳萬生開始落後，于盛泉搶得第四名。</p>
<p>十八圈半（九二五〇公尺）：一切情形大致差不多。</p>
<h3 id="c100">最後一圈　速度加強 <a href="#c100" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e100" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">100</a></h3>
<p>最後一圈開始：樓文敖速度加強，是時劉景理落後約四百餘公尺，至最後二百五十公尺，搜文敖復越過第三名于希渭，而直衝終點，於萬衆鼓掌歡呼聲中，獲得冠軍。</p>

<p>二百公尺決賽　男子二百公尺決賽，事先皆以爲上海與台灣之決鬥，台灣四人，上海二人，馬華一人，靑島一人，上海容承彪有後勁，足可與台選手一拼。但結果前三名皆爲台灣包辦，容承彪幸列第四，第五又爲台灣，馬華第六。出發後許通最先，容承彪與其他台灣三選手，在一百米處尚能一綫　進，至最後二十米，容承彪竟後勁不足退列第四名。許通第一，徐天德·陳英郎分列二三名。成績二十三秒四，平平而已。事後據說：容承彪跑鞋壞了，借吳仲海鞋穿，太大不能使勁。運動員事前無準備，自難取勝。</p>
<p>四百公尺中欄　中欄決賽，爲馬華名手黄兩正繼高欄決賽之後，又一傑作，亦爲昨日田徑較萬米更爲生色之一項。黃兩正以五七秒九，打破程金冠五十八秒三之全國紀錄。與第二名天津呂佐夫相差幾一欄。黄兩正起步，踏步闊而準，渦欄似有節拍，到達終點，因有攝影記者攝影，否則或許成績能更佳，爲之可惜。海軍張之淸第三，台灣賴有德，重慶馬國銓，陸軍芮士珍，依次到達。</p>
<p>千六百公尺接力　千六公尺接力決賽，又爲台選手取勝，台灣四將一路領先，直衝到底，相差第二名上海隊，當有三十餘米，上海隊與北平隊競爭殊烈，相差僅少許而已。三隊名單如下：</p>
<p>第四棒　陳英郎容承彪　任堯</p>
<p>女子六十公尺決賽　女子六十公尺決賽，靑島王淑桂繼一百公尺之後，又獲第一名，包辦女子短跑兩次冠軍。南京兪人佳起步最快，得第二名，王淑桂直至五十米之後，才見挺進，加緊速度直衝到底，重慶李心一與人兪佳，僅一肩之差，難分彼此。四五六名李小璧，郭美麗，鄒開春，俱僅一步之高下而已。時間八秒三，尚佳，六十公尺因係新項目，故記錄無從比較。</p>
<p>女子二百公尺決賽　女子二百公尺決賽，王淑桂實力不加，爲福建陳碧英所壓倒，屈居第二，陳碧英長力勝人，百米之後，速度大增，後勁甚足，王淑桂身體腿部較胖，長路不如人，落後陳碧英一米許。李心一人小，列第四，蔣光鼎之女公子蔣抗日獲第三名。廣東二女將李小瓊，梅舜顏，過於嬌小，退爲第五第六·台灣林白嬌漢口馮子芹落選。</p>
<p>女子四百公尺接力　女子四百公尺接力決賽，爲靑島隊獲得錦標之關鍵，總分頻添十四分，遂以四十七分獲得女子田徑錦標。起步後，第一棒祗見河北趙宏一馬當先，在前領導，廣東梅舜顏，靑島王季榮，追隨於後，第三棒廣東蔣抗日，　將河北隊張奇超出，而靑島隊　樹龍已與廣東隊並駕齊驅至第四棒王淑桂卒以最快速度奪獲第一，廣東李小　第二，相差甚微，河北王樂義第三，台灣女將接棒技術不熟，列第四名。</p>
<p>男子八百公尺決賽　考將于希渭以二分六秒四獲得冠軍，勝來殊甚輕鬆。遼寗李合龍實力亦頗不弱，曾與老于作激烈之競爭，但在最後五十公尺內，卒因衝刺功夫欠到家，而爲老于超出三公尺之遙。所謂棋高一着，縛手縛脚也。後四名之實力殊爲平均，到達終點時，前後相差均極緊凑，計陸軍倪泅得第三名，其次爲聯勤車克英，靑島宋文堅，及河北罵連城。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕昨日田賽，共有女標槍，男撑竿跳決賽二項。角逐經過，兩項成績，均屬平平，惟撑竿跳一項，競爭殊爲劇烈。全程自二時半起賽，直至六時許，始告完畢。茲比賽過程兩項略述如次：</p>
<p>女子標槍，註册者二十九人，實到者僅十七人。預賽三擲中，過二十三公尺者，僅得六人。三擲時，台張瑞妍連跑帶衝，粉臂一揮，竟得二十七·八四公尺，小孫三次再擲，得最高成績二十七·五二，氣得蛾眉倒掛。現把各人名次成績，探錄如次：</p>
<p>（一）張瑞妍（臺）二七·八四公尺</p>
<p>（二）孫素霞（靑）二七·五二公尺</p>
<p>（三）周祖芬（滬）二四·九七公尺</p>
<p>（四）尹韻音（冀）二四·六一公尺</p>
<p>（五）宋金環（閩）二三·六八公尺</p>
<p>（六）胡翠華（京）二三·〇一公尺</p>
<p>男子撑竿跳，二時半點卯，結果到了廿八名。從二·八〇公尺起跳，比賽過程牛步化。跳到四點半，橫竿才加到三·二〇公尺。前前後後，依然有十人跳過。五時，橫竿加到三·三〇公尺，除了空軍黄建和台灣張立郎，一跳即過外，其餘諸子，個個都三跳不過，終算敗下陣來。高度加到三·四〇公尺時，黄建輕描淡寫，一跳即過。立郎一跳不過，二次終算揩油過去。三·四六公尺時，祗見黄建自遠處持竿衝刺而來，塲外一片喊好聲，好不威風。半空裏潑下來的姿勢，眞是飄飄欲仙。這時立郎脚筋不免有些軟化下來，但元氣不餒，硬挺挺的又是揩油、一番，過竿而去。橫竿加到三·五二公尺時，黄建一跳時太大意，身子過去了，手却把橫竿帶下來。這時立郎突然像注入了一針興奮劑，持竿從容奔來，不慌不忙，一個鷂子翻身，淸晰鬆脆，過得竿去，一反過去拖泥帶水的樣子。這一跳，直叫黄建頂門上挨了下悶棍，使黄建神志恍惚起來，致二跳時，雙腿忽然與竹竿絞軋起來，人還未過竿，就凌空掉下來。這一下，把腿也軋傷了。試跑兩次，無法再跳，祗得忍痛放棄該得未得的錦標。剩下立郎一人跳成績，他好大胃口，一加就要三·六〇公尺，究竞精疲力竭了，兩跳未過，第三跳自動放棄。以致最高成績，僅止於三·五二公尺。三小時又半的長期抗戰，所得的成績，跟符王（保盧）的舊紀錄比比，還差上一呎半光景。現在把名次和成績，記在下面：</p>
<p>（一）張立郎（台）三·五二公尺</p>
<p>（二）黄建（空）三·四六公尺</p>
<p>（三）余鐵軍（粵）三·二〇公尺</p>
<p>（四）陳書煌（粵）三·二〇公尺</p>
<p>（五）陳良（警）三·二〇公尺</p>
<p>（六）盧鐵中（陸）三·二〇公尺</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕昨日上午十時廿五分，田徑塲內尚未峯行比賽，觀衆尚少，此時北看台上突有槍聲一響，一人應聲倒地，觀衆飽受　驚。旋經記者探悉，係保安警察第六中隊警士張文龍，將所携手槍予同隊警士楊華，不意膛內裝有十彈，誤觸發射，致彈穿入楊之左小腿內，血流如注，不支踣地，後經救護車趕到，將傷者送警察醫院救治。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕萬衆矚目下之足球錦標循環賽，今日正式展開激戰序幕。下午二時，上海對陸軍，四時，警察對香港，兩塲均在大會田徑場舉行。按單循環制規定，四隊中每一隊祇有三次此賽機會，每勝一次得二分，和局各得一分，失敗者無分，故今日四隊兩組之戰，將直接影響冠亞兩軍之輪廓，換言之，如警察負於香港，或陸軍負於上海，即任何一隊敗一次，則該隊問鼎冠軍錦標之希望即顯然减少。因此，四隊大軍，屆時必出全力爭奪，自是意料中事。至各隊今日出塲之陣容，可能如下：</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕男籃錦標單循環決賽，於十一日下午起，在大會塲體育館舉行。大會原　將上海男女籃球隊，對印尼女及聯勤兩隊之球賽，移往陝西路體育館，旋以接受各籃球隊之意見，亦仍在大會塲體育館舉行。</p>
<p>上午十一時，即有球迷千餘人，候此精采之球戰啓慕。下午六時，人益潮湧而至，爭先恐後，如醉如痴，各門均爲球迷堵塞，門票銷售一空，爲上海籃球賽中之成事。</p>
<p>男籃菲僑以五十四比三十三輕取警察，上海以三九比三十七倖勝聯勤，此爲最緊張激烈之戰役，按單循環賽之計分法，菲僑上海各獲兩分。茲將各塲比賽經過分誌於后：</p>
<p>菲警之役</p>
<p>下午四時揭開戰幕。菲僑先聲奪人，余進受陳金置之命，擲入一球，紀録遂開。金置復獲吳慷慨之助，殺入重圍，投而未中。警察傳其俠於中距離遙射中的，成二比二。警察陳愼思犯規，陳金德主罰未中，警察沈　舉又被判罰，吳慷槪又未罰中。菲僑陳金置亦犯規，徐仲己過度堅張，球自籃筐滾出。警察王蓉生犯規，金德罰中，擊破此沉寂之空氣，三比二菲僑佔先一分。</p>
<p>金置控球前進，假動作「派司」與金置，無如未得默契，球爲警察何增截獲，攻略未果。警徐仲己出，巷以吳新運。菲僑金德來一下馬威，直取一城，五比二，菲僑吳慷慨奪球侵人判罰，王蓉生罰中，成七比三。警察樂嘉洲人替王蓉生，菲僑吳慷慨獲球運入敵陣，金置用擋人戰術待吳投射，再度未獲默契，吳與陳互撞，球爲警察所奪。移時，菲僑吳慷慨　起射球命中，警察吳新運亦獲一球。菲陳金德又犯規，警徐仲己罰中，七比九警察微露轉機，菲僑李世僑入替陳金德，觀衆鼓掌歡呼，菲僑蔡金典犯規，警察樂嘉洲罰中，八比九，分數益形接近。</p>
<p>菲僑李世僑初觸法條，警樂嘉洲罰中，成九比九，觀衆大鼓掌。菲僑李世僑再度犯法，樂嘉洲罰未中的，吳慷慨又犯法，徐仲已罰獲一分，十比九，警察佔先。菲蔡金典又被判罰，徐仲已罰而未中，斯時爲菲僑多事之秋，警察仍佔先一分。金置力挽大局，遙射中的，十一比十，金置再中，十三比十。菲僑吳慷槪拉人，徐仲已罰中，十一比十三。警樂加罰犯法，余進罰中，警察叫停，沈　舉再入，樂嘉洲離塲，非余進立給顏色，又中二分，十六比十一，十七比十一，十九比十一，警沈鵬舉力奪一城，十九比十三。無如菲僑李世僑沿邊疾進，獲得兩分，二十一對十三，菲僑佔先上半塲。</p>
<p>下半塲開始，警察不利，徐仲巳犯怯被中一分，二十二比十三，菲陳金置又中，二十六比十三是時菲僑分數漸次遞進，而警察益見緊張失態，三七比二四，菲佔先一三分，四一比二六，四四比二八，四六比三〇，菲僑聲勢益盛，終塲時，記分牌高懸五四比三十三，菲僑輕取警察。是役警察失於過度緊張，菲僑表演較前進步，故下半塲警察大負。</p>

<p>滬聯一仗</p>
<p>入時登塲。鄭大光破籃，蔡文華罰屯，鄭大光再度投入，聯勤以四比一佔先。吳成章擲中，廖滌航犯規，包松圖連擲帶罰，上海遂以六比四超出。蔡忠強與包松圓表演出色，聯勤射籃多半偏失，而籃下球上海佔盡優勢，聯動一度以十二比二十四落後六球之多。聯勤發揮快速之傳遞，曹志吉三擲，王士選一罰，前半結束，聯勤追成二十一比二十六。</p>
<p>下半時，上海　震中退休，蔡演雄入代，蔡文華，吳成章，包松圓，蔣忠強仍舊。聯勤仍以淸一色輜汽十六團五人作戰。上海隊氣力漸感不支，雙方心理均陷八極度緊張擲籃罰分，俱無中的。下半時開賽已七分鐘，竟未開紀錄。蔡文華，鄭大光各中一球，上海仍以二十八比二十三領前，吳成章被撞腰傷復發，陳學崇入塲調出吳成章，廖滌航投入，蔡演雄，鄭大光雙犯規，鄭大光罰中，蔡演雄未得分，廖滌航近簌瞄射，造成各二十八平手。此時觀衆吶喊不已，蔡忠強中一空心監，李震中再上塲，替出蔡演雄，賈志軍籃下得手，二次造成平等。各三十三時，鄭大光犯規，蔡忠強罰入，曹志吉一擲，聯勤以三十五比三十四首次超前，吳成章扶傷入塲，替出陳學崇，蔡忠強罰得一分，成谷三十五。李震中二次犯規，鄭大光曹志吉先後罰中，聯勤又以三十七比三十五超出。此時尚餘四分鐘，王士選五次犯規離塲，卜彥适入替未向記録員報告，被判犯規，吳成章·蔡忠強兩罰供偏出關外，幸蔡文華振臂一擲，成各三十七平手，包松圓籃下撩八，三十九比三十七。時間所餘無幾，李震中。廖滌航犯滿出塲，上海採取傳遞，消耗時刻，卒以此寶貴之一球，保持勝利，亦云幸矣。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕男子籃球循環賽，今日有兩塲：（一）上海遇警察，（二）聯勤對菲華。上海隊　將如雲，記者以爲不宜與十一日之役似的儘以此五人作戰，見氣力不繼時，應更替生力軍上塲，如仍如十一日打法，則勝來亦恐不易。警察旣獲菲律濱之教訓對上海之戰，更應沉着應付。</p>
<p>聯勤善　電戰術，強硬切入，勇猛遞射；而非華則長於以佯攻誘敵，竄入獲分；兩滕相遇激戰自必難免。惟聯勤如能加強其射籃命中率，或可獲勝，倘神經過份緊張，則恐將　於菲僑。</p>
<p>十三日應爲　標之最後決戰，爲上海對菲律濱。記者以爲勝宜關　在上海的合作精神上。上海隊個人技術平均的總和要較菲僑爲優，惜因合作未臻理想，致白費力氣甚多；菲華有後勁，如上海力袞，則可造成菲華獲利之機會。（裕生）</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕女子籃球循環賽昨有二塲，結果菲律賓先　後衰，最後數分鐘演出失常，以廿一對廿八敗於福建。印尼亦以不習室內作戰以卅二對四十一覆師於上海隊　銳攻勢之下。茲分　戰情如次：</p>
<p>菲僑先盛後衰</p>
<p>福建對菲僑之戰，於下午二時展開，開賽一分鐘，福建黄桂英犯規，菲律賓楊秀枝未罰中，黄如蘭截獲勇射中的，二比〇菲僑佔先。移時，菲蔡淑琼犯現、福建黃桂英罰而未中，菲僑陳玉澗反下二城，福建陳聚才還以顏色，許心喜亦佔二分。繼而福建林雪娥侵人犯規，陳　　未罰中，福建黄如蘭犯規，菲楊秀枝主罰中的，福建許心喜中一球，菲僑陳玉澗還二分，成九比八，菲僑薛淑琼犯規，第一節時間已到，裁判宣布第二節補罰。</p>
<p>戰幕再啟，福建陳聚才罰中，九比九平局；菲僑劉佩珍又犯規，福建許心喜罰獲一分；觀衆爲菲僑躭憂，在呼一加油。菲僑陳玉潤應命中的，黄如蘭又加一球，菲僑復佔先；自後雙雙方各藉罰球得分，上半時終了，十六比十一，菲僑佔先。</p>
<p>下半時開始，福建開始反攻，十九比十六，菲僑仍佔先第三節。第四節時，福建許心喜籃下跳起射球落網，菲僑陳玉潤報以兩分，無如葉貽靖陳玉潤相繼犯規，許心喜三罰皆中，二十一比二十一，又成平局。觀衆在呼雙方加油達三分鐘之久，斯時菲僑反見緊張，投擲未中，而福建罰一中三，遂以二十八比二十一，福建反敗爲勝。此局菲僑三節均佔先，觀衆料亦必勝，最後一節之失，恐係輕敵之故也。</p>

<p>上海對印尼之戰，上海　綫銳利無比，石宗閩，黃明媛，穿入籃底如入無人之境，從容投中，獲分累累，印尼似未慣習地板作戰，竟有三人赤足臨塲，印尼所憑恃者原爲敏捷之動作與準確之投籃，動作旣受塲地拘束，欲速不達，上海有宗蘭先告中的，明媛一再投入，印尼以〇比十一落後，前鋒心理大受影響，慌惶之下，竟作無的放矢之遠射，徒勞無功，黄瑞良調出李秀麗，上塲即罰入一分，始擊破鴨蛋紀錄第一節，印尼十三比二落後。第二節爲二十三比九，印尼仍無起色。第三節印尼之射籃漸上軌道，桂馨，玉瑛，瑞良各中一球，明媛亦大顯身手，李秀麗再人塲，瑞良下野，秀麗利用其身材，在籃下伺奪傳球，乘間投入，第三節結束，追成三十一比二〇。末了一節，桂馨先中兩球，三十一比二十四，比數逐漸接近，觀衆鼓掌助威，明媛罰中，玉瑛獲中一球，三十二比二十六，印尼落後僅三球；上海前鋒再加緊壓迫，四十比二十九，明媛與秀麗雙方犯規，明媛罰入而秀麗未中，王珊四次侵人犯規被罰離塲，王務醴入代，秀麗擲罰，連奪三分。惜時間已屆，印尼終以上半時之失態，落後過多，無法趕上，以四十一比三十二失利。</p>

<h3 id="c112">東北·華北·臺灣·三團體　為大連足球隊事件呼籲　對全運會當局提供三項意見 <a href="#c112" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e112" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">112</a></h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕東北選手團總領隊劉化鵾及天津選手團總領隊趙亞夫代表東北，華北，台灣三團體爲大會處置大連足球隊員毆打裁判員事件，於昨日下午四時招待記者，認爲大會審判委員會議決之處置辦法太過份而不公平，爲使此事件圓滿解決，希望重加考慮，採納合理之處理辦法。</p>
<p>東北總領隊劉化鵾首先報告稱：東北在目前之艱苦環境下能派代表參加全運會，是極不容易之事，東北選手久在敵僞之下，此次來參加，主要意義是使他們來看看國家的情形，以增加東北人民之向心力。日前發生不幸事件，大連球員之不禮貌行爲固應微戒，但大會因一二球員之越軌行動而將整個大連隊如此嚴厲處罰，甚至取消下屆全運會之參加資格，實欠合理。大迎隊現尚未接到大會通知，希望其不見諸實現，否則東北代表團決不接受。</p>
<p>天津總領隊趙亞夫稱：全國運動會之意義，第一爲提倡體育，第二爲聯絡各地感情。靑年人因一時情緒衝動而致形成越軌行動在所不免，大會對於此種事件之處置，應以具有教育指導意義爲原則，使越軌者知所改過而圓滿解決。但此次先則將大連球員押送警局，繼則擬向法院起訴，此種辦法實非大會應有之態度，至如取消大連資格，及通知潘陽市政府將大連足球指導負　職，尤屬不當。華北台灣代表團目睹此種情形，爲打開僵局，現特提出幾點意見，涌望大會採納：（一）維持大會及裁判員之尊嚴，（二）以教育精神處理此事，使大事化小小事化無，勿以法律從事。（三）給予東北代表團自己檢討並處理犯規隊員之機會，大連隊員之處罰交由東北總領隊劉化鵾負責處置。以上各點辦怯當由三團體向總幹事郝更生及總裁判張伯苓貢獻，俾可合理解決而避免今後不幸事件之再度發生。出席招待會之雲南女子籃球隊領隊張鐵珊以私人資格亦起立發言，認爲：（一）大會中毆打事件已有三次，不應單獨對大連如此處罰。（二）東北在日本佔據下十四年，感情上對於東北代表應有特殊優待，決不應反予特殊處罰。</p>
<p>最後記者詢以如交涉無結果，將採取何種態度。趙亞夫答稱：吾人並非正式提抗議，僅爲提供意見，希望大會接納。如大會不接受，華北及台灣代表團自無關係，東北如何則將視情形發展而定。總之，同爲中華民國兒女，希望此事能合理解決。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕全運會游泳比賽，定今日上午十時起，正式舉行。爲限制觀衆人數起見，大會昨經決議，每日發售入塲券以四千張爲限，每張定價四十萬元。除大會各票亭僅准當日出售外，並由九江路儲匯局，上海市銀行，及漢口路交通銀行，先行預售。</p>
<p>游泳比賽舉行時，預料觀衆必將空前擁擠，大會方面，爲事先防範計，業由該會工程委員會決定，於看臺櫃杆內圍，再以粗大木椿密集排列，如是則有兩道防綫，可免再蹈欄杆坍倒之覆轍。同時大會又決全力加強警衛工作，無票者一槪不准入塲。昨據警術組負責人表示：該組早已先作準備，決發動大批警士，包圍游泳池四圍並稱：」保證連蒼蠅都飛不進去。」</p>
<p>水池上空　勿發傳單</p>
<p>全運籌委會，十一日發佈通告，請連日用飛機自空中散發傳單之各負責機關注意，勿在游泳池上空散發，以免傳單落在池水中，將水管塞住，不易淸理，影響比賽進行。游泳比賽今天</p>

<p>游泳比賽今天起接連四天，每天售四千張，每張四十萬元，算起來，游泳池每天門券收入，可達十六億元　陳掌諤談：菲律賓游泳代表五人，已有三人因練習游泳着凉，身體不適，但對已參加的項目，仍將抱病全力一拼。</p>

<p>實力銖兩悉稱　戰來石破天崩　觀眾大喊：「香港好！」</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕男排循環錦標賽、昨在，在市體育館舉行，一般認爲有冠軍希望之廣州隊，被香港擊敗，比數三比一。另一塲上海對警察，原定昨下午舉行，但臨時宣告改期。</p>
<p>穗港之戰，實爲粵籍排球健將之戰，兩軍戰技並駕齊驅，搏鬥之烈，厮殺之猛，得未曾有，實爲排球開賽以來之最驚人一幕。</p>
<p>兩隊陣容如次：</p>
<p>一二兩局中，港隊大施計謀性之進攻，例如前排中堅跳起作殺球狀，而瞬息間却由二排飛出殺手，迅向對方空檔快扣一記，同時前排三員鎖網極其稱職，使穗旅連續之猛攻一再撲了空。職是之故，港方連取一二兩局，而且並不十分費勁，兩局比數爲廿一對十一，廿一對十三。</p>
<p>及至第三局，穗隊才認清球路，識破港旅戰略，勇猛反攻，激戰達最高潮，至十三比十四時，雙方互不稍讓，以扣還扣，以殺還殺，穗隊之陳英寬與港方之鍾士元，均連續臥地救球，寸土必爭，球被往返扣擊者近一分鐘，觀衆興奮若狂。眞是精彩得無以復加！但此時港隊稍感黎連澤·趙連五·等之壓力，乃以十六比廿一，敗於穗隊。到了第四回合，廣州步步進逼，港方略感吃不消，鎖網不及在一二兩局中之嚴密，穗方再以廿一比十，勝了香港。</p>
<p>第五局開戰，兩軍志在必勝，屢次造成平手，但香港隊鎭定沉着，不似穗隊之易於慌亂，（尤以三排中堅呼喊不休，殊足使全軍洩氣），因而終以廿一對十八，險勝第五局，而定天下。</p>
<p>昨賽至中途，一度因穗隊之屢向裁判員爭執，而引起糾紛，幾乎中止競賽，幸港隊指導風度極佳，約束隊員，樂於接受裁判員意見而不惜讓步，觀衆大呼「香港好，香港運動道德好！」</p>
<p>警滬今晨交鋒</p>
<p>男排循環賽中警察對上海之戰，原定昨日下午舉行，但臨時宣告改期。頃大會已決定改於今日上午十時舉行。又男排洛選賽，浙江對新疆，今上午九時交鋒，吉林對湖南，十時開戰。以上均在市體育塲排球塲舉行。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕女子排球錦標賽上海與湖南之戰，市體育館看臺上全是湖南老鄉，軍人尤多。</p>
<p>開賽時上海啦啦隊首先　動，湖南軍人不甘示弱，大喊衝鋒號，祗聽到，殺！殺！殺！一一片殺聲。</p>
<p>第一盤上海贏後，看臺上情緒愈來愈緊張，不少人認爲裁判不公而攘臂高呼：「媽的，打！」上海啦啦隊一看形勢不對，趕緊歛旗收兵。</p>
<p>有許多不相干的觀衆夾在中間，下意識地高聲呌囂，刺激會塲情緒，實在最最要不得。</p>
<p>接下來一塲是香港對廣州方子排球，雖然同是廣東同鄉，情緒却也相當緊張，雙方都有幾次向裁判質問。有人說：「大會的裁判眞不容易做。」</p>
<p>廣州起先連輸兩局、第三局才扳回。一位廣州啦啦隊以說：「眞危險，如果吃鴨蛋，那有面目回沙面？」</p>
<p>浙江女子排球隊數戰地北，該隊隊員因全係浙大女生，大考在即，故由領隊沈芳夏向大會請准後，不再參加落選賽，業定今日全隊離滬返杭。（中·育）</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕女排四種子隊循環決賽，巳於九日開始競逐，冠軍呼解極　之上海隊，並已首先壓倒台灣，而頗有亞軍希望之湖南女兒軍，則亦已大勝廣州。兩隊昨上午相遇於市體育館，雙方均擁有啦啦隊湖有兩隊，數約百人。</p>
<p>滬湘得分問題　今日開會商決</p>
<p>首周　，上海以廿一比四之懸殊獲勝後，湘方啦一啦隊認爲裁判鍾志強裁判錯誤，數度喊打，形勢緊張得分。旋滬方啦啦隊即接受第三方面之勸告，停止啦喊</p>
<p>第三局進行時，球塲情緒失常，觀衆均感大殺風景，滬除隊員演出亦失常，湖南隊以廿一比十七得勝。</p>
<p>第三局開始，雙方志在必爭，戰到十六平手後，上海得分，比數爲十七對十六，湘方啦啦隊認爲滬隊連擊四下，實爲失分，乃再度喊打，準備傳入球塲，幸有鐵絲網擋住，並州大批警察趕到維持秩序，未生意外。但湘方啦啦隊員堅持上海隊所得第十七分應作無效，滬隊則持相反理由，不願犧牲第十七分，由是比賽宣告暫停，第十七分問題，交由大會解決。大會定今日開座談會商決之。</p>
<p>滬湘兩隊陣容附後：</p>
<p>臺灣大勝廣州　呈一面倒之勢</p>
<p>下午臺灣逢廣州，勢成一面倒，台隊以二比零奏凱。兩隊陣容如次：</p>
<p>廣州隊前中後三排均極懦弱，對台隊所發「攻擊球」，多無怯撲救，而台隊前排左，二排右之一殺一扣，常令穗隊無從招架，因此一·二兩局，陣隊均以十比廿一之差敗下連來。</p>
<p>台隊昨日演出較前進步尤多，雖身材較矮，但並未因此吃虧。尤令人稱賞者，則爲臺灣小姐之服從裁判之精神及運動之風度，當每次比賽結束後，不論勝敗，台隊全體隊員必齊集網前，向對方各隊員敬禮並握手，表示球藝與感情爲兩回事。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕關於上海及湖南女排循環賽糾紛事件，兩隊業巳向大會當局，正式提出抗議，其抗議書業巳送呈大會文書組。審判委員會爲此特於昨午六時，召開臨時緊急會議。</p>
<p>據悉：大會對兩隊抗議書均予受理，並定今日上午十時，再舉行審判委員會，會議由王正廷親自主持，務必迅連謀得合理解決，決不拖延。會方表示，此例決不可開，否則今後比賽均無法繼續舉行。解決之道，以公允爲原則，今日即可作最後決定。</p>
<p>又據探悉：湖南隊抗議書之主要內容，爲秩序單刊明，排球應在室外舉行，而結果改在室內，實屍不公允，請求重改塲外舉行。而上海方面則表示湖南啦啦隊一部份觀衆之舉動，顯係違反運動規則，且影響成績，請大會主持公道，並要求已得之十七分，務須承認云云。</p>

<p>長吁短嘆　煞是好看</p>
<p>第二幕男子王友信（台）遭遇鍾展成（港），首局戰來精彩萬分。兩人每負一着，或仰天長吁，或拍臀短嘆。十五比十三鍾展成先取第一局，王友信並因鍾倖勝一着（球觸桌角），氣極蹬足，踏破一球。次局王以十一對四扳回一局，三局鍾以十一對九復勝一局，此時觀衆羣呼王友信加油，王乃使出解數，十一對四，十一對八，二度告捷，結果三比二鍾遂敗北。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕男子壘球錦標賽，最後四隊，業已產生，循環決賽，亦定今日開始。首塲台灣對警察，上午九時在逸園舉行。警察由臺灣選手隊代表，內外塲防守功夫，俱臻上乘，所差者投手渦軟，不免爲敵所乘。故今日與　標呼聲最高之台灣作戰，恐難取勝耳。</p>
<p>第二戰滬粵對壘，上海選手，十九系出「熊貓」，守衛極佳，僅擊球尚朱盡臻理想而已：廣東方面，熔港穗精英於一爐，實力自是雄勁，虎鬥龍爭，正未知鹿死誰手也。</p>
<p>男子落選賽，福建對浙江，前者擁有約犬好手多人，上次僅以一分敗於警察，今取浙江，當可游刃有餘。</p>
<p>女壘亦由滬粵對壘，上海隊係集約大，瑪利亞·中西·三校菁華，且同係梁扶初氏門牆桃李，一脈相傳，聯絡默契，自是高人一等。廣東隊除投手馬蓮秀特別高強外，並無若何特色。今日勝負，當繫於上海擊手之能否逃避馬蓮秀三擲之危險也。</p>

<p>— 本報記者　梁酉廷</p>
<p>〔本報特寫〕孫觀連日的排球競賽，一般對男排女排的冠·亞·季·殿名位，已有一個輪廓的槪念。那就是：男排的冠軍以港穗最付希望，尤以香港呼聲最高；警察與上海將店于第四兩位，警察似強于上海。</p>
<p>本來，廣州男排是被認爲可取冠軍的一支勁旅，但以該隊沙塲老將李福申（三排中），丘廣燮（二排左）米能趕到參戰，以致在昨日循環賽中以二比三敗於香港，同時香港在昨賽中所表現之實力，的確攻守自如，又使一般觀衆重新估價了香港，而認爲港隊居首座之希望極大。</p>
<p>港隊七項優點</p>
<p>記者以爲：穗港警三隊互有短長，港隊是否能穩得冠軍，尚須碰碰運氣，不過香港隊有其衆所公認的優點：（一）鎖網技術，屬於上乘，且爲諸強之冠，因此，對於俗善取攻勢的總隊與警隊，似乎並不感到嚴重威脅；（二）進攻時頗有技巧以掩護攻勢方向，使對方　不着球路之來去；（四）善發攻擊球者約達五六人，全隊實力平均；（五）二排左的余啟恩不失爲一員得力殺手，對伙快扣之道，頗有把握；（六）三排中堅的鍾士元，實爲三排之傑出人材，對撲地救球及供球助扣有獨到之功，絕不遜于其他三強的任何一位三排中堅；（七）港隊隊員都爲久經沙塲之戰士，善於沉着應戰，打悶聲球。</p>
<p>基於上述數點理由，港隊對冠軍一席，照理應不致落空；不過，港隊唯一缺點爲攻勢少於守勢，倘使吃虧，當種因於此。</p>
<p>警察富有朝氣</p>
<p>次論警察隊：該軍富有朝氣，以粵台山中學爲班底，曾獲粵省全運錦標，但最大缺點爲經驗不足，攔網較差，進攻時沒有虛虛實實的戰略，這一點正與港隊相反。據記者看來，警排實非港隊之敵。</p>
<p>廣州亦屬強者</p>
<p>至於廣州隊現有陣容，其得力戰士當推前排黎連澤，後排陳英寬及二排的趙連五，實際上其實力與香港不相上下，只是攔網一道尚不及港隊堅強，雁戰時不若港隊鎭定，偶一失誤，每易慌亂，因此這次被香港打敗下來，但穗隊如與警滬兩旅相遇，自然又當別論了。</p>
<p>滬隊難禦南軍</p>
<p>末論上海男排：大家都知道她的實力已遠不及上屆全運時的上海隊了，何况全運前夕「華嚴」與港隊作友誼賽時，打了敗仗，尤足顯示上海的排球難與南方隊伍相抗。這次滬隊所遭遇都是三支廣東軍（穗·港·警），前途如何，殊難樂觀。不過，滬隊亦擁有健將黄耀華（三排中），衛鼎彝（二排中）及翁誠光，鄭亦泉等，如能配合得宜，亦不致如何坍台，只是鄭亦泉與翁誠光的攻勢恐將被對方看住，尤其是當滬隊遭遇港穗兩旅的時候。</p>
<p>女排大局已定</p>
<p>關於女排形勢，其實已無庸多贅，因爲已有三塲的循環賽業已打過，問題在於滬湘之役臨時發生的變故，大會的處置如何？但無論如何，以言球藝，滬隊似居於冠軍，昨日滬湘在第一回合作戰中，滬隊以廿一比四致勝，正爲明證。</p>
<p>四個種子隊中，以穗隊最差，不論前三名如何安排，穗隊之將居末位，乃爲無所異議者。</p>
<p>因此，我們可以得一結果：女排冠軍以滬湘呼聲最　，滬隊尤甚，台隊對亞軍也有希望，不過也可能列於季軍，而廣州則將爲殿軍。</p>

<p>— 孔令穀</p>
<p>—以高山族神話為例—</p>
<p>我們在西門豹投　巫的記事中，知道了河伯娶婦的故事。河伯娶婦，是後來的說法，其本來的意議，其實是以少女爲犧牲。以人爲牲的故事，在小說上是時有見到的，牠的來求，實在於犧牲一人保全群體的一點上，其出發點是合情合理的，，但在西門豹的記叙中則一方面變爲迷信，一方面成爲惡俗了。</p>
<p>以人爲牲，意義有二，一是上面所說的，譬如山中有互蛇猛處，時出噬人，送一個替死者去，就可保全一村的安寗。一是含有厭勝作用。厭勝作用的例子，可於高山族北勢番始相傳說中見之。</p>
<p>據北勢審的傳說，太古時大覇尖山有一巨石，一天自然剖裂，中有男女二人走出，這就是北勢番的始祖。一天兩人因爲好奇，互相抱持，有一匹金蠅飛來，教以人道。於是產生四孩，孩子成長，互爲婚配，以後子孫繁衍，教成一氏族</p>
<p>這時候大洪水暴發，日夜增長，幾浸及山頂。同族聚議，以爲這一定有觸犯禁忌，所以使大神發怒，應設法加以禳解。及早謝罪。先投一狗，水湧如故，繼投一老人，水仍有增無减。社人驚惶萬狀，莫知所措。經嚴密檢查，發見有兄妹密通的情事，就把那兄妹投之海中，洪水方漸退去。其時兄投大安溪中，妹投北港溪。現在那裏有峻峰萬丈，溪谷千尋，就是當時洪水泛濫所形成的。</p>
<p>道一神話可以說明投人於河，一方面實含有厭勝的意義，至石中生人，則與禹生石紐爲一類神話。大禹在古代應是被人視爲一氏族的始祖的。（寫在國貨公司舉行之合灣高山族風俗藝術展覽前夕）</p>

<p>十二月十五日，紅十字會開徵求會員大會於Mechanic　Hall與迫宏受之往焉。有比婦克拉克夫人演說當年德犯比土慘虞情形，比人力竭不屈，及紅十字事業之艱辛。夫人慷慨義憤，一坐動容，繼有演說俄國情狀，及德之對俄方略，無甚精彩，終爲Mr．Stockton　Axson，威總統之姻戚也，任紅十字會書記，新自戰地歸，其言紅十字之功績及將來擴充之計劃，將宏濟普天下之困窮無告者。</p>
<p>余於是夕之會，得二感想，共一震於他邦婦女之急義犯難，雖男子有遜色焉。論我國其盲塞勿較言，女學界大致皆躭遊樂，奇容異飾以眩世俗，託言自由以遂凈放令人聞女學生之名而有所戰焉慄焉！</p>
<p>夫彼昌言女權，而其極乃自貶自賊，我雖欲尊之敬之而勿可得。夫社會家族之進化興革，女子有職焉，今若是，復何言耶！有一二拓弛之士，獎夸導諭，未嘗不熟忱，而鄙頑之男子復從而譏摧之，方今言女權猶萌孽焉，是搔抓可絕而恣意躪踐之，豈不傷哉！</p>
<p>言國必自羣，羣必自家，家也者，男女之所成也。故存圖治天下之心，必兼及乎女子，於是志摩經營中國之大夢，又增一鉅條，嗟乎！安得光明女丈夫哉！</p>
<p>又有所感，則余嘗知光陰之可貴矣！而未知所以貴之，即今溯往事，未嘗不恨其倍謬，今者因循摸索，曾未能自闢徑塗，則今日之沈沈，又爲他日嗟嗷之張本；時日益逝，不其殆而！原余之出，不僅從書卷中求知識，將放耳目以觀天下之經權，　事理之體要，而後能觸類傍通，氣識並涵；今沾沾以楮葉自拘，是雖涉萬里，猶之未行也。昧昧而出，罔罔而歸，從可知矣！豈不殆哉！</p>
<p>比來假七日矣！作書而外，惟羣聚作無謂之談天，適寒蓩鎖空，氣機滯悶，冰雪塡衢，行無所之，即平居思想亦閡塞不靈；甚矣其疲也！道安語，盍往紐約鄉，以過費辭之。余以爲與其窮守，不如怒張，紐約不少英賢之士，不當交臂而失之，行矣復何疑。</p>
<p>前日姜君來，中校舊人今在哈佛習數學，沈篤之士，獨慮其歸國後，無相當之機會以專意精研，終不能與世界學者共馳驅爲可惜耳！因姜言，得知三年前一度邂逅之唐腴盧，亦在哈佛，腴廬英英露爽，所嘗愛慕者，曩因元龍子識之。因亟修械付去，稱述前情，今日得復恣橫曼彩，情致煦然，不禁神爲之往，異日相見，把臂話故舊，亦一快心事也。</p>

<p>— 趙景深</p>
<p>英國的啞劇</p>
<p>英國每年冬天必有啞劇（Pantomime）的演出。這種娛樂，從聖誕節起，要演一兩個月，甚至有演三個月的。各大城市的重要劇院都要演這種戯。別處都沒有這樣的例子，所以常爲外來的客人所不了解。這是神仙故事和音樂的混合，其中有感傷，「擊板」（Slapstick是兩塊扁平的木板，一端繫緊，他端放鬆，當甲敲乙的時候，用這東西來表示打擊的沉重），舞蹈和賈藝。孩子們喜歡這個，因爲許多諧請他們都是很熟悉的。他們去看啞劇，總感到他們自己的年齡太大了。成人也喜歡道個，就因爲它有稚氣。沒有一處地方是成人頭腦所能修想得出來的。啞劇裏也有歌曲，這是演者唱的，或者我們稱爲手勢戯，史爲適當一些吧，</p>
<p>英國現在這樣的啞劇形式還只有一百年不到的歷史。起初是用有韻的詩，充滿了諧趣和幻想。登塲人物許是十八世紀的王子查明（Charming）戴着假髮，穿着絲衣服。這樣詩劇的傳統，被伊利沙白時代的大才所承認的，結果到現在竟淪爲通俗劇塲的東西。</p>
<p>戴似面具和小丑作風是使觀衆最感到　味的。人們常摹仿動物，穿着動物的毛皮，或者男人扮着女人，或者女人穿着男人的衣褲。這是在英國現代啞劇還可以看到的。</p>
<p>民間故事和通俗傳說的主角，每每是年靑的女人，她有優美的腿，又有很好的歌聲適宜於唱歌。所以王子查明一出塲就是女性的腿，用高音獨唱，他甚至可以唱到最近的政治。反之，老太婆每每是喜劇男演員扮的。</p>
<p>年代迭換，歌韻也有更易，但故事總是老樣子。「灰娘」，「無貓國」，「紅帽兒」一直在演着。蘇裕闌尤其喜歡這一套。一天演兩次，聖誕節後連演幾個星期，兒童到學校裏去讀書，成人們就接着去看。阿斯齊（Arthur　Askey）是啞劇最有名的演員。</p>
<p>美國詩人魯賓生（Ecwin　ArilingtonRobin）的詩，似乎一般社會和批評家對他都很冷淡。在熟烈地討論詩歌的圈子裏，他的詩也很少談到。但在較高素養的學者圈子裏的詩却有很高的評價，特別是他的「船主克來格」（Captain　Craig）和「死過兩次的人」（The　Man　WhoDied　Twice）。他們覺得，在惠特曼死後，夏芝已到晚年的時候，魯賓生的詩是可以與哈代並稱的。</p>
<p>在他的一生中，他曾得到羅偉爾（Amy　Lowell）的稱讚。他在戯劇性的獨白「約翰白朗」（John　Brown）中曾借一個精靈般的人說：「倘若我死了，我有更多的話要說。」現在，的確，在他死後十三年，他的新的書簡集出版，他說了不少的話。他的聲音，像他的詩「盧克·哈佛蓋爾」（Luke　Havergai）中的聲音」樣，似乎是「從墳墓裏出來告訴你的。」</p>
<p>最近所出版的魯賓生的書簡集是第二卷，分量比第一卷多一倍。第一卷是一九四〇年托南斯Ridgely　Torrence）所主編的。現在的一卷，時期是一八九〇年到一九〇五年，包括他在哈佛的時代，這些信是寫給他兒時的一個朋友史密斯（HarryDeForestSmith）的，史密斯後來做了阿姆赫爾斯特（Amberst）的希臘文教授。史密斯是魯賓生認爲少數可以信託的人當中的一個，他可以把他作詩的意向和詩的本質向他傾訴。這些信寫得特別動人。並非因爲他是一位書簡作家，他只是傾吐他的詞實的話而已。</p>
<p>他有一封信給史密斯說：「有時我想到地獄並不怎探十分壞。倘若有硫磺，也許有一點不愉快，但我想一個人是用不着怕它的。想一想他的伴侶吧。倘若你與我同坐在火紅的圓漂石上讀都德和左拉，這不也是一件愉快的事麼？」</p>
<p>魯賓生詩人的聲譽是從努力得來的，不是天生的他曾經做過哈佛的特別生；他在哈佛兩年，自修過莎士比亞和霍桑，並且想與史密斯合作，把莎福克里士（Sophocles）的「安特宮」（Antigone）譯成無韻的英詩。</p>
<p>他的信中又談起，「我現在正在寫盧克，哈佛蓋爾，這可不是閙着玩的」。後來這一首詩竟成爲他的名伶。</p>
<p>我們希望能再發現一些魯賓生的倍，他那賣不掉的短篇小說也希望能够找到。必須在材料更多的時候，纔能寫他的傳記和詩歌的詳盡研究。</p>
<p>這本舊簡集是蘇特克里夫（DenhamSutcliffe）所編訂的。書名很特別，叫做「非三角的星座」（Untriangulated　Stars），我們希望能把這古怪的書名忘掉。</p>

<h3 id="c146">大學教職員 <a href="#c146" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e146" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">146</a></h3>
<p>— 翼君</p>
<p>讓我告訴你一點關於大學里的教授和職員的情形教授是窮和忙，職員則除了窮忙以外，還要加一賤字。</p>
<p>前幾大發薪水，幾位教授領了薪，各人都挾着一大包鈔票，相對苦笑道：「Forty　dollars」。聽他們算：「戰前大餅一分錢一只，如今一萬元只買得兩只大餅，就是等於那時兩分錢，薪水兩千萬元恰等於四十元，這還是就吃而言，若就穿的標準來說，還不到四十元呢！」以這樣貧乏的待遇，焉得不窮呢？有些窮教授，營養不佳，精神萎靡，衣冠不整，外表看來那裏像個教授。</p>
<p>爲了窮，於是不得不忙起來，忙以濟窮，才得免餓死。怎麼個忙法呢？最普通者有兩種情形：其一是因爲雇不起老媽子，忙着抱小孩，買小菜，燒飯烹調，甚至倒痰盂，筆者就曾親眼看見過一位教授整個上午連上四課，跑回來還要自己生火燒飯。其二是在他校兼課，一個人兼上三校四校的是平常事，筆者所屬學系的系主任不但在他校兼課，並兼系主任。教授們這般手忙脚亂，聲嘶力竭的，縱不至於「误人子弟」吧，至少對人子弟不無影嚮。由於疲憊奔走的結果，把上課當作「奉行故事」者，或亦有之。</p>
<p>因爲教授日常流動性太大，學生有什麼問題要求教授解答或討論，往往是「踏破鐵鞋無覓處」，縱然幸而覓着了，他還不見得歡迎你，因爲他需要休息。有此教授因爲兼的學校多，每週來不得三兩次，再加上請病假事假的，見面　機會就更少，一旦被我們看到他來上課了，竟會生出「那陣風兒把您吹來的」之感。</p>
<p>外國大學里的教授，往往就是一個科學家，發明家，或著作家。他是一個教育家，而不是一個「馬不停蹄」的教書家，我們跟他們比起來，眞是不可同日而語。</p>
<p>教授之窮得「怪可憐」，忙得「不亦樂乎」，表過不題。如今要說一說窮而且忙，再加上「賤」的職員先生了。教授雖是窮而忙，卻還有人尊敬他們，學校當局更是待以上賓之禮，住室都可以多撥幾間給他們。而對職員呢？則大有賤得如敝展之槪了。辦事離不了官派，說話離不了官腔，埋頭窮幹，還要忍氣吞聲。據說以前有個學校，爲了糾正這種歧視職員的現象，乃在稱呼上一反習慣上的教職員，而稱職教員，用意固善，但如僅是斤斤於　一兩個字次序的顚倒，畢竟是捨本逐末。</p>
<p>然而無論如何，這究竟還是一些枝節問題，大問題還是一個窮字。大學里的教職員實在窮得可以了。</p>
<p>我因爲是一個窮學生，所以不禁「同窮相憐」起來。</p>
<h3 id="c147">擠出來的文章 <a href="#c147" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e147" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">147</a></h3>
<p>— 鐘秀達</p>
<p>這里要談的「擠」不是魯迅先生的「推」「踢」那樣的性質，而是一個寫作上的實際問題。</p>
<p>彷彿記得前幾天有位先生在本刊寫過一篇「談寫不出」，當時我只很草率的看過一遍。那位先生大槪主張寫文章要一順情所至」，沒有可以寫時，就乾脆不寫，不勉强，也不窮榨。這種說法，當然也有他的道理，因爲勉强寫出來的作品，往往失之平凡。爲了不使讓者厭惡，不如不寫。這是一種很純正的見解，也是學者應有的態度。但如一定說爲了不使自己的作品「失之平凡」或有「矯揉造作」之嫌，而必欲「順情所至」，倒也大可不必。寫好文章通常需要靈感，有靈感時寫下的作品，總比沒有靈感時所寫的要來得好，這是實在的，我們不容否認。然而靈感並不是永久存在的，也沒有簡捷的可用人工製造的方法。設必「順情所至」而等待靈感，够多麼苦呢？又如文章寫到一半而好久沒有靈感，沒有好心情，又怎麼辦呢？</p>
<p>從品質上言，我覺得沒有靈感，也照樣可以寫得出一些好的作品來。魯迅先生說自己大部分的文章都是在平時殫精竭慮的「擠」出來的，現在我們看他的作品，並不感覺到怎樣平几或是矯揉造作，而且簡直够得上稱一聲「好」。因此我認爲作品的好壞，並不全在有沒有靈感，而更主要的還在於作者寫作時的態度。</p>
<p>這是「擠」。這種費精勞神的事，當然是件苦事。然而奇怪的是有些人竟連「擠」的機會也得不到了。前些天，我聽見許欽文先生懊喪的敍述關於他自己近年來寫作的情形。他說，他只要有二三個鐘頭的空暇，就可以「擠」出一點東西，可是，爲了生活的壓迫，他不能寫，常然更談不到想寫一點好的作品。可見在目今的社會里，「擠」也並不是每個人必有的權利了。</p>

<p>晚淸末葉，本報人才，一時鼎盛。據予所知，有天南遁叟王紫詮，叟長州人，喜漫遊，其名刺有「歐西寓公，東濤詩伯，天南遁叟，淞北逸民」等字樣，所謂淞北逸民者，蓋主木報籍政，賃　海上也。叟與霧裏看花客錢昕伯，高昌寒食生何桂笙，時人號爲本報三傑。听伯工詩詞駢文，目短視，較遠之物，即不甚了了，因有霧裏看花客之稱。桂笙邊於舊學，從之遊者頗多，如高太痴，周品琱，其尤著者也。桂笙因令太痴品垇襄理本報輯務，太痴嘗與諸騷人詞客，結希社，爲社中祭酒。品珊皖產，別署病　詞人，納妾曰二寶，故又自署日蘊實樓主，旋離本報，而主同文滬報之消閒錄。浦左黄式權，別署畹香留夢室主，亦簡署夢畹生，擅駢文，典麗矞皇，堪稱獨步，繼何桂笙之後，入本報總持大綱焉。常涉足梨園，於報上撰粉墨叢談，復刊單本，爲評劇之先聲。又縷馨仙史蔡紫　，上海人，諱爾康，予藏有其名刺一紙，上列有歷辦申報副主筆頭銜，則蔡亦本報舊人也。此外如倉山舊主袁翔甫，爲簡齋之孫，以主持本報，乃就近於福州路胡家宅，闢楊柳樓臺，門前植柳成行，翠縷飄拂，對之意緒灑如。翔甫時與諸朋侶，飲酒吟　其中，幾不知世間擾撰事。絕有趣者，則爲咠城朱子美，子美諱昌鼎，爲龍門書院高材生，筆壘縱放可喜，本報主任慕之，耽之撰寫論說，洋洋灑灑，語多切中肯要，深爲讀者所歡迎。前輩海上漱石生與之相契，嘗謂子美宿於報館，每夕好徜徉通衢，歸必購取食品，納於袖底，興至則沿途大嚼，習以爲常。某寒夜，購凍豬脚肉，裏以枯荷葉，仍藏衣袖而歸，途中乃嘗鼎一臠，詎道旁適一洋獒至，嗅得其腥，向之猛攫，幾噬其手，子美驚惶失措，餘肉自袖中紛紛擊地，祗能任　飽啖，頓足大呼負負，館中同事知之，引爲笑柄。又韓子一雲，亦茸城人，字太仙，任職本報有年，冶遊有得，著花國春秋一書，以曹雪芹以京語作紅樓夢，是書乃用吳儂軟語，旣成刋行，易名海上花列傳，再版時，胡適之且爲作序。又因小白菜一案牽涉之楊乃武，聞寃白出獄，曾入本報爲編輯，則是否確實，不得其詳矣。（編者按：楊乃武會任本報駐紹興通訊員。）</p>

<p>盧山之西端，有鶉鴿峯者，下有錦峯別墅，亦曰瓶廬，背倚靑山，晚霞如彇面對尚湖，春永猶香，前淸翁常熟相國革職後隠居處也。故後即葬於此，墓前樹翁氏自書「削籍大臣翁同蘇之墓」九大字；迨宣統間，開復給諡後，乃移　於翁氏家祠。</p>
<p>翁氏革職後，淸廷命地方官嚴州加管束；是以每屆朔望，翁氏即步往常熟昭文兩縣衙見知縣，恭敬誠恪，如對君父，然地方官對之至爲局促不安。</p>
<p>翁氏曾自搗鴿峯徒步入城，有詩曰：「風帆一片傍山行，滾滾長江怒不平；傳語蛟龍莫作怪，老夫慣聽怒濤聲。」託興深遠，弦外之音，不無對朝中宵小作譴詞也。</p>
<p>翁氏邨居，絕口不提仕宦，有人提及朝中事，卽憤怒形於顏色。亦不與縉紳通，惟與其甥兪金門孝廉及吳鴻綸茂才最　，城鄉之隔，音書不絕；布衣之士往謁，亦假以辭色；山樵請作畫，每欣然濡亳，若達官求墨竇，則經年不報，或令趙古泥代筆。然向城中近芳園菜館叫菜，則自命筆，該館生人亦知珍藏，頻年積藏，遂乃成疊，每出以示人，人盡豔羨。</p>
<p>翁氏垂歿，有絕筆詩示家人曰：「六十年中事，悽凉到蓋棺，不將兩行淚，輕爲汝曹彈。」狀元宰相，人所羨慕。彼乃自感身世凄涼，世之欲求顯達者，可以憬悟矣。</p>
<p>民國初年，康有爲陳三立曾來謁墓，厚犒守墓人。有爲自謂翁氏曾向淸德宗保薦，有其才勝臣十倍之語，但還問翁氏日記則無之，兪金門復力白無其事；且謂翁氏力誡金門毋與有爲交往，稱其人心地不良云云·傳信傳疑，是當先諸研冗淸史者之考訂已。</p>

<p>寄居在親戚家本不是辦法，於是在無可奈何下，典賣了次要的什物，在江　找了一個板棚房來住，付過了一月不太高的房租，心中好像是輕鬆了許多。</p>
<p>誰知全國運動會在江澎舉行，靠近全運會的板棚房立時而聲價十倍，而且是按日納租，每日房金據說有一百萬元到二百萬元的，假若是出租半月，便可有幾千萬的收入。我不幸租房就在會塲附近，而房主也是見錢眼開的人物，爲了他的橫財大運，便不惜「武裝」了言辭下了逐客令。</p>
<p>我不好怪他，因爲現實就是如此。爲了以後再議租居的條件，我便無條件的退讓了，結果又不得不搬回原來寄居的親戚家裏去，這一趟來回的搬運費也只好自認倒霉。由此可知上海難住，就是市郊鄉鎭中也並不例外。</p>

<h3 id="e1">Northeast Generals Depart Beiping to Return to Defense; Battle Situation to Have Significant Developments; Chairman's Letter to Wei Lihuang Carried by Zhao Jiaxiang; Grain and Ammunition for Beiping and Jinzhou to be Airlifted to Changchun and Shenyang <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>[Our Beiping Dispatch on the 11th] Several Northeastern generals have departed from Beiping. Zhang Zuoxiang, Ma Zhanshan, Zhao Jiaxiang, Liao Yaoxiang, Wang Tiehan, Dong Yanping, Luo Youlun, and Northeastern elders such as Mi Chunlin and Yu Jichuan, flew to Shenyang together at 2:30 PM on the 11th. Zhang Zuoxiang said, "The Northeast is in danger. We Northeasterners must go back and take a look. I will decide what to do later after I get to Shenyang." Ma Zhanshan said: Where he will be stationed in the future will also be decided after discussions with various parties in Shenyang. Zhao Jiaxiang said: It is not yet clear whether the current actions of the Communist bandits in the Northeast constitute the seventh offensive.</p>
<p>[Our Shenyang Dispatch on the 11th] Zhang Zuoxiang, Ma Zhanshan, Zhao Jiaxiang, Liao Yaoxiang, Wang Tiehan, Mi Chunlin, Luo Youlun, and others arrived in Shenyang by plane at 5:00 PM on the 11th. According to relevant sources, the overall plan to save the Northeast has been finalized.</p>
<p>[Our Shenyang Dispatch on the 11th] Zhao Jiaxiang refused to express his opinion on the war situation, only saying that he would report to Commander-in-Chief Wei Lihuang. Zhao's attitude seemed quite optimistic. Zhao also brought the Chairman's personal letter to Wei Lihuang.</p>
<p>[Our Shenyang Dispatch on the 11th] Several Northeastern generals who went to Beijing to attend the military conference returned to their defense posts on the 11th. There will be important developments in the Northeastern war situation. It seems that the two armies are vying for the initiative in western Liaoning. The defenses of the three major strongholds of Changchun, Shenyang, and Jinzhou are becoming increasingly complete. Efforts are also being made to strengthen the transportation of grain and ammunition. The Northeast in May is entering a tense stage of gathering clouds but no rain. The enemy seems to have completed its replenishment, but is still hesitant to move forward, which is quite intriguing. A certain general said, "We are not afraid of the bandits coming to attack, but we are afraid that they will not come to attack."</p>
<p>[Our Pan Yang Dispatch on the 11th] The Suppression Headquarters Air Transport Office was officially established on the 11th and began operations. In order to break the deadlock and strengthen the battle, the authorities decided to airlift grain and ammunition from Beiping and Jinzhou to strongholds such as Changtao. It is expected that 30 planes will be dispatched daily, flying 90 sorties, and 20,000 tons of grain can be transported to Pan in three months.</p>
<p>[Our Jinzhou Dispatch on the 11th] Reports state that several squadrons of air force reinforcements have arrived in western Liaoning, possessing a majority of fighter planes and bombers. In addition, the Jin County airfield has been expanded and rebuilt and will be completed soon, becoming a major air force base in the Northeast.</p>
<p>[Our Pan Yang Dispatch on the 11th] The Changchun garrison launched an attack on the 10th, clearing the villages near Dafangshen and Kuanchengzi airfields, and no large groups of bandits were found.</p>
<p>[Our Jinzhou Dispatch on the 11th] Fan Hanjie told reporters: "The rumors that a major battle is brewing in western Liaoning are not true. Because the national army in the Liaoxi Corridor has been reorganized and deployed for a long time, the defensive and offensive posture is advantageous. The bandits know this very well and will not launch an attack rashly. Moreover, they themselves are suffering from unspeakable pain and lack good solutions. Recently, they may attempt to harass the interior of the Pass, with the target possibly being Tangshan. The national army has now deployed troops in eastern Hebei to launch a mopping-up operation, in order to assist in stabilizing North China, and then North China can powerfully assist in the development of the Northeast, so as to achieve the effect of mutual assistance."</p>
<p>[Our Jinzhou Dispatch on the 11th] In order to strengthen the organization and training of the people in western Liaoning, the Northeast Suppression Headquarters has specially dispatched more than 200 political workers, who will fly to Jinzhou in batches. They will carry out work in Jinzhou, Jinxi, Xingcheng, Suizhong, and Jinshi.</p>
<h3 id="e2">Legislative Yuan Continues Preparatory Meeting; Committee Members Nominated on the Spot by Each Unit; Drafting of the Method for Electing the President and Vice President of the Yuan <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 11th] The preparatory meeting of the first Legislative Yuan under the Constitution has been held twice on the mornings of the 10th and 11th. The Drafting Committee for the Rules of Procedure also held its first meeting on the afternoon of the 11th. On the 12th and 13th, the Drafting Committee for the Rules of Procedure and the Drafting Committee for the Method of Electing the President and Vice President of the Yuan will hold meetings separately in the morning and afternoon. If progress is smooth and the two regulations can be drafted smoothly, the third preparatory meeting at 9:00 AM on the 14th will be able to quickly pass the two regulations.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 11th] The first Legislative Yuan under the Constitution held its second preparatory meeting on the morning of the 11th. A wide-ranging discussion was held on the draft of the method for electing the President and Vice President of the Yuan. Finally, committee members were nominated to form a Drafting Committee, responsible for drafting the method. The second preparatory meeting opened at 9:40 AM, chaired by Wu Tiecheng. Lou Tongsun reported that a total of 487 committee members had registered, and 375 were present today. The minutes of the first meeting were also read. Wu Tiecheng announced that the Drafting Committee for the Rules of Procedure would meet at 3:00 PM this afternoon, and each committee member would publicly nominate one to three people as conveners. Then, he announced that discussions would be held on the method for electing the President and Vice President of the Yuan: those who requested to speak were very enthusiastic, totaling 37 people. Those who obtained the floor included committee members Wu Jingpeng, Yin Shuxian, Yu Fuxiang, Wang Puhan, Chen Ruxuan, Du Guangxun, Lu Jingshi, Huang Yuren, Hong Duanjian, Xie Chengyu, Fang Zhichao, Qiao Shushu, Huang Guoshu, Yang Dezhao, Guo Dengao, Miao Qiping, Zhang Jinyu, Chen Guyuan, Chen Haicheng, Zhang Shiyang, and others. The opinions of Yang Dagian, Wu Zhiren, Qu Zhisheng, Deng Gongxuan, Hou Shaowen, and Tian Peng were read by the Secretary-General on their behalf. There was a 20-minute break during the meeting. At 12:00 noon, it was still not finished. Zhong Tianxin proposed extending the time and stopping the speeches. Chairman Wu Tiecheng put it to a vote, and it passed with the approval of 285 people (out of 451 people in the hall). Wu then summarized the opinions of the committee members, totaling 13 points: (1) Establish a Drafting Committee for the Method of Electing the President and Vice President of the Yuan. There are two methods for generating committee members: one is to have each unit nominate one person, and the other is to have the meeting nominate seven to nine people. (2) The President and Vice President are elected separately. There are four methods: 1. If two-thirds of the attending committee members are present, the candidate who receives more than half of the votes is elected. If no one receives more than half of the votes, the three candidates with the most votes will be re-elected once, and the candidate with the most votes will be elected. 2. If more than half of the attending committee members are present, the candidate with the most votes is elected. 3. If one-fifth of the attending committee members are present, the election will proceed. 4. The defeated candidates who participated in the presidential election can still participate in the vice-presidential election. (3) Candidates are nominated by signing. (4) The single-name joint-ballot method is used for the election. (5) The secret ballot method is used. (6) The method of nominating candidates without signing names is used. (7) An election committee is organized. (8) Mutual election is changed to election. (9) The method of party nomination is used to nominate candidates. (10) Select separately from the list of all committee members, use ○ to circle the candidates for President, and use to circle the candidates for Vice President. (11) The President and Vice President are elected at once, and the candidates with the most votes are elected. (12) Free competition is implemented, but illegitimate methods must not be used. (13) A method for impeachment is also drafted. In addition, Hong Ruizhao pointed out during his speech that the National Government announced the implementation of the Legislative Yuan Organization Law of March 31 last year on May 1, but the law was amended on December 25 last year. This is a major error and should be resolved by the General Assembly to request the Civil Service Department to correct it. Wu Tiecheng said: Most of the committee members who spoke advocated setting up a Drafting Committee, so he first put the first point to a vote. Of the 451 committee members in the hall, 298 agreed to establish a Drafting Committee. Regarding the method of generating committee member candidates, Wu first put the proposal of nominating seven to nine people from the meeting to a vote, but only 44 people approved it, which was a minority, so it was passed that each unit should nominate one person. At 12:20, Wu announced that each unit would nominate separately on the spot, and asked Wang Yi to nominate female committee members. After 15 minutes, the committee members from each unit were nominated one by one and read out by the Secretary-General. Wu Tiecheng then announced that all units that have not yet nominated should submit the list to the Secretariat before 6:00 PM this afternoon, so that the meeting can be held on the morning of the 12th. At the meeting, one to three people will also be publicly nominated as conveners. The meeting adjourned at 12:40.</p>
<h3 id="e3">Legislative Yuan Rules of Procedure; Nomination of Committee Members to Draft <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 11th] The Drafting Committee for the Rules of Procedure of the Legislative Yuan held its first meeting at 3:00 PM on the 11th. 56 committee members attended, chaired by Zheng Shuwen. The committee members expressed their opinions extensively on the old rules of the Legislative Yuan during the period of political tutelage and the needs of the Legislative Yuan under the Constitution. They all believed that the former was only a government legal institution, while the latter is now the main organ of power. It not only decides on laws and regulations, but also enjoys various consent rights and questioning rights of general parliaments. The tasks and status are very different, and the old rules have no possibility of application. After studying the constitutional provisions related to the powers of the Legislative Yuan and the details of the Legislative Yuan Organization Law, a new start should be made and re-drafted. Most committee members believed that the number of votes for major matters should be strictly regulated to show solemnity. The methods for exercising consent rights should be listed in detail in a special chapter. The rules of procedure and methods of various committees should also be described in detail. Some committee members also expressed their opinions on the nature of the rules themselves, believing that they should follow the old rules of the Legislative Yuan during the period of political tutelage and follow the constitutional provisions to enact a law. Finally, it was decided to nominate seven committee members to form a drafting group. Various materials, meeting minutes, and written opinions submitted by various drafting committee members were submitted to the group for comprehensive research and to draft the first draft. As a result, Chen Guyuan (convener), Zheng Yanfen, Chen Haicheng, Du Guangxun, Tong Guansai, Dai Xiujun, Zhang Jintie and other seven committee members were elected to form the drafting group, and they will conduct research and complete the first draft as soon as possible, and submit a report at the second meeting of the Rules of Procedure Drafting Committee on the afternoon of the 12th. The meeting adjourned at about 5:00 PM.</p>

<h3 id="e5">President Truman Sends Letter to Congress Urging Appropriation of Aid to China Funds; Aid to Europe Funds Expected to Be Handled Concurrently <a href="#e5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>[United Press Washington Dispatch on the 10th] President Truman today requested Congress to appropriate a total of $818 million in aid funds for China, Greece, Turkey, and Trieste. China will receive $463 million, of which $278 million will be used to subsidize imports necessary to maintain the national economy, $60 million will be used for rural relief and reconstruction, and $125 million will be provided as a grant. The overall foreign aid bill passed by Congress last month only authorized the government to formulate a foreign aid plan. Unless a special appropriation bill is passed separately, it will be meaningless. Regarding the $5.3 billion in aid to Europe, the President has already consulted Congress to allocate the full amount. The House Appropriations Committee is currently hearing opinions from all parties and is expected to handle the aid to China and other funds concurrently with the aid to Europe funds. No decision is likely to be made in the next few weeks.</p>
<p>[Associated Press Washington Dispatch on the 10th] President Truman sent a letter to House Speaker Martin on the 10th, requesting an appropriation of $818 million for the aid to China, Greece, Turkey, Trieste and other bills that have been passed. Of the total $800 million in funding Truman requested, China will receive $463 million, Greece and Turkey will receive $275 million, Trieste will receive $20 million, and the remaining $60 million will go to the International Children's Relief Fund.</p>
<h3 id="e6">Chairman Summons Zeng Qi, Hoping for Continued Cooperation Among the Three Parties <a href="#e6" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c6" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">6</a></h3>
<p>The Social Democratic Party Holds Central Standing Committee Meeting in Shanghai</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 11th] Chairman Chiang summoned Zeng Qi, the leader of the Youth Party, at his official residence at 10 AM on the 11th, and had another meeting on the issue of legislators. Zeng also provided some opinions. The conversation lasted for 50 minutes before it ended. The Chairman's opinion is still that he hopes that the three parties can continue to cooperate and seek a solution to the issue of legislators. He also hopes that this kind of consultation will continue, because the issue of legislators and the establishment of the new government are actually two sides of the same coin.</p>
<p>[Reported by This Newspaper] The issue of the number of legislators for the Social Democratic Party and the Youth Party is difficult to resolve despite the efforts of mediators. However, since Xu Chuanlin and others returned to Shanghai yesterday morning, the Central Standing Committee meeting was held at 10 AM, and all responsible personnel attended. As a result of the meeting, it was decided to maintain the previous position, and the attitude will become more resolute due to the convening of the Legislative Yuan meeting. Xu Fulin, Jiang Yuntian and others will not return to Beijing in the short term, and no one has been contacted in Nanjing on behalf of the party. It is reported that Li Qi of the Youth Party is very resolute, but Zeng Qi, who is staying in Beijing, has a more moderate attitude. In addition, after Mo Dehui came to Shanghai, he has contacted the main leaders of the Social Democratic Party and the Youth Party separately. Mo's mediation opinion is to hope that the two parties accept the Chairman's suggestion of half the number, and then discuss the rest. He has no new plan to propose himself. Regarding the consequences of the stalemate, the responsible personnel of the Social Democratic Party said that the party only has three members participating in the government, and the government will be reorganized soon, so it is natural to withdraw. Therefore, it is not necessary to reveal it at this time. When the joint statement of the two parties was issued, reporters asked Chu Xiaohuang about the Youth Party's attitude towards this matter, but he did not express it.</p>

It is reported that the regulation will be sent to the Legislative Yuan for deliberation to complete the legislative process.</p>

<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 11th] This summer, the distribution of cloth to public servants and teachers will still be implemented in the four cities of Beiping, Tianjin, Nanjing, and Shanghai, according to the regulations of last year. Each staff member will receive five zhang of bleached cloth and one and a half zhang of khaki uniform material, and each worker will receive one and a half zhang of bleached cloth. However, the price has yet to be determined. According to last year's distribution price of 1,700 yuan per chi for white cloth and 1,900 yuan per chi for khaki, it is reported that the competent authorities have proposed to increase the original distribution price by five times last year, to 12,200 yuan per chi for bleached cloth and 11,400 yuan per chi for yellow khaki.

<h3 id="e16">Political Committee Members Sign General Resignation Letters; Presented to the Chairman for Approval Before the President Takes Office; All Six Pacification Headquarters to be Abolished Soon <a href="#e16" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c16" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">16</a></h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 11th] After the Executive Yuan's general resignation proposal was passed by the political affairs meeting, the resignation document was submitted to the political affairs meeting on the 11th for distribution to all political committee members for signature. It is learned that this work has been completed, and the resignation document will be presented to the current National Government Chairman Chiang before the President takes office for approval, in order to complete the legal procedures. As for the work of various institutions under the Executive Yuan, it will continue to be promoted until the candidate for the new President of the Executive Yuan is announced, and then it will be suspended. It is also learned that because of the expectations of all parties, the current President of the Executive Yuan, Zhang Qun, is still expected to serve as the new President of the Executive Yuan. Since the future Executive Yuan will appear in the form of a responsible cabinet, the future policy of the Executive Yuan will be more important than the candidate. Therefore, Zhang is now paying attention to the determination of future policies, so as to refresh the people of the country and cater to the world trend.</p>
<p>[United Press Nanjing Dispatch on the 11th] Officials said: The new Constitution does not have provisions for the establishment of Pacification Headquarters, and the existing six Pacification Headquarters in Beiping, Wuhan, Chongqing, Qingzhou, Northeast, and Northwest will soon be abolished as a step towards the party's entry into a constitutional government. The establishment of these Pacification Headquarters often results in overlapping military and political agencies, and even causes serious conflicts with provincial governments. After the Pacification Headquarters are abolished, the heads of each will be reassigned to new positions. In addition to Li Zongren being elected Vice President and Song Ziwen originally serving as Chairman of the Guangdong Provincial Government, Zhang Zhizhong may be transferred to serve as Chief of Staff of the Presidential Palace. The whereabouts of Cheng and Zhu Shaoliang have not yet been determined.</p>

<h3 id="e19">How to Make Good Use of American Aid <a href="#e19" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c19" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">19</a></h3>
<p>Since the enactment of the American Aid to China Act, various parties have deeply concerned themselves with the question of how to utilize American aid. The authorities are also carefully considering it. This aid may have a significant impact on our country's finances, currency, prices, and various agricultural, industrial, and commercial sectors. According to this Aid Act, the Sino-US exchange of letters, and the President of the United States' message to Congress requesting appropriations the other day, the allocation of American aid can be clearly determined as follows: (1) Construction projects, i.e., economic assistance, totaling US$338 million. This includes the following parts: (i) Temporary preliminary measures, i.e., proceeding with the Sino-American Relief Agreement first, until July 3 of this year, with funds advanced by the Financial Rehabilitation Bureau, not exceeding US$50 million; (ii) Economic maintenance of US$278 million, including the previous item; (iii) Rural reconstruction expenses of US$60 million. (2) Additional, i.e., so-called military assistance, stipulated not to exceed US$125 million.</p>
<p>The second type above is a gift. Regarding rural reconstruction expenses, it is stipulated that "US dollars, or Chinese legal tender obtained from the sale of goods, or a combination of both, may be used." Specific conditions still need to be proposed by the United States, and another agreement must be signed with our country. What is most noteworthy now is how the first type, second item, economic assistance will be used, and what kind of materials it will contain.</p>
<p>Section 404 of the American Aid to China Act only stipulates the amount of aid to be provided within one year and does not specify whether this amount should be paid in cash or provided in goods, or a combination of both. Although the US President's message the other day specified that it would be used to improve the import of essential goods to maintain the Chinese economy, it did not explain whether these funds would be allocated in cash or used to purchase goods for shipment to China. According to the announcement of the Economic Adjustment Special Office, the United States will first send an investigation team to China to plan the use of funds related to the restoration of industries such as electricity, railways, and mining. The items supervised by Repuhan, head of the Aid to China Mission, also include food, oil, cotton, and other industrial raw materials. Thus, it is known that cash payments will be, at most, only a part of it, and the majority will be goods. What needs to be investigated, studied, and consulted is precisely the "types of these goods and the cases and methods of procurement and distribution."</p>
<p>Because cash payments will only be a part, a small amount, and there is no certainty, the reform of the currency system is out of the question unless another loan is negotiated separately. Although the goods include the aforementioned food, oil, cotton, industrial raw materials, and proposed projects for roads, mines, and power plants, these are only predictions. The specific final decision will naturally be made during the Sino-US negotiation of a bilateral agreement.</p>
<p>What needs to be pointed out to the public first is that regardless of whether the final form of aid supplied is cash or goods, it is still goods in the end. Because providing cash is nothing more than allocating foreign exchange funds, and the payment of foreign exchange funds is still mainly for the purchase of goods, the question of which goods should be prioritized for purchase and how the quantities of various goods should be rationally allocated is a topic worth studying today.</p>
<p>Currently, foreign exchange is scarce, and quotas are too small, placing the import and manufacturing industries in extreme difficulty. In particular, many industries are closing factories, relocating, reducing working hours, and laying off employees due to the lack of raw materials. Therefore, we are willing to offer two principles in order to address the urgent needs: (1) Consumables, except for food, should be reduced as much as possible; (2) Emphasis should be placed on urgently needed raw materials and all necessary equipment. Because handling it this way can maintain many tottering industries and avoid much unemployment, which is more meaningful and has a more active and lasting effect than simply supplying consumables. The American Aid to China Act originally stated: "This effort will quickly achieve domestic peace and economic stability in China." Repuhan, the head of the delegation, also stated: "Anything that can develop China's production and help put China on a stable footing is a major step in the right direction." We believe that the above principles are fully consistent with the purpose and direction of preventing economic decline that friendly nations hold.</p>
<p>As for how to dispose of the Chinese legal tender cash obtained from the sale of American aid materials, this issue is also worth attention. According to the Sino-US exchange of letters, the materials supplied in the preliminary measures are handled according to the relief agreement: (1) for reconstruction, (2) except for agreed expenses, they should be stored in special accounts and consulted on separately later. However, it is stated that the nature of this aid is different from relief, and its use may be changed in the future after agreement between the two countries. Also, in the exchange of letters between the two countries, the United States stated: Regarding the funds for construction assistance, if repayment is required, the conditions will be determined later. Thus, except for the US$125 million for military purposes, which is definitely a gift, whether the remaining US$338 million in American aid materials should be repaid and how to repay them will be determined later. However, even if repayment is required in the future, or even full repayment is required, the deadline will not be too hasty. Within this short period, it should not be difficult to agree on temporary use, which is a very obvious fact.</p>
<p>We believe that this huge sum of cash is most suitable for the following two purposes: (1) Making up for the deficit and filling the national treasury's shortfall. Everyone knows that the biggest problem in the current economy is nothing more than inflation. The reason why inflation continues to increase is simply because fiscal revenue and expenditure cannot offset each other. Therefore, using these funds to make up for the deficit in public finances, although its direct effect is to stop or slow down the increase in currency issuance, its indirect effect is to stabilize prices, stabilize finances, and stabilize the overall economy. The positive and beneficial effects it produces should be greater than any other technical method. Officials have announced that only US$100 million is needed to collect all the currency in circulation, and the American aid materials that can be sold in the future are worth as much as US$338 million. Therefore, this problem should not be difficult to solve smoothly, at least for a considerable period of time, it will not always resort to the printing press!</p>
<p>(2) Purchasing slow-selling domestic products. There are many contradictory phenomena in the current economy, such as suffering from a shortage of materials on the one hand and suffering from overproduction on the other. This phenomenon is most evident in many export goods and certain manufactured products. The reason is that costs are too high, and the exchange rate is too unreasonable, causing exporters to be in a difficult situation, which will undoubtedly affect future reproduction and the livelihoods of the vast rural areas. As for the products of factories, such as cement, machinery, etc., because other industries are too depressed, sales are sluggish, and they are in a dilemma. Under this embarrassing situation, the state should come out to purchase them separately to alleviate the current difficulties and protect the vitality of industry and commerce. According to regulations, the current policies of ordering and purchasing goods have not failed, and many financial institutions, under the banner of controlling materials, are unfolding this method to encompass all materials. However, these many materials mentioned above are all unpopular and unprofitable. We are not in a position to speculate whether they are willing to treat them equally and be happy to purchase them. Even if they are happy to purchase, how will the capital for purchasing and ordering goods come from? Is it still necessary for the central bank to issue a large number of banknotes under the methods of re-mortgaging or rediscounting? Then, although a small number of related industrialists and merchants can obtain financing and slightly revive their dried-up tracks, the pain of inflation and soaring prices will universally fall on the general public. Isn't this helping one while hurting another? This cash obtained from the sale of American aid does not come from increasing the amount of currency in circulation, and it does not necessarily increase the burden on the treasury. If a portion can be allocated to handle purchases, to wait for the market to improve, it seems that it is not inconsistent with the purpose of stabilizing prices and stabilizing the economy.</p>
<p>Currently, there are many proposals from all sectors regarding the use of American aid, such as developing the southwest, opening mines, building roads, and building factories, etc. These naturally have their own profound significance. However, if the unstable situation of the economy deepens and cannot be effectively curbed, then the existing established businesses will be in danger and unable to stop. What can be said about increasing and developing? Therefore, we propose the many suggestions above, which have a value that should be given priority.</p>
<h3 id="e20">Grain Merchants Purchase Flour for Re-export; Spokesperson of the Ministry of Food Discusses Handling Principles <a href="#e20" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c20" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">20</a></h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 11th] A spokesperson for the Ministry of Food recently issued a statement on the issue of grain merchants purchasing flour for re-export, saying: The flour approved by the Ministry for grain merchants to re-export, especially those applying to purchase and transport in Shanghai, has recently been ordered to purchase from various flour mills and submit official invoices from the flour mills and certification documents from the local flour industry association for verification and release. The purpose is to avoid grain merchants purchasing in large quantities from the market and stimulating flour prices. Hereafter, all grain merchants purchasing flour from the Ninth Qi of Hankou and the Shanghai Fourth District Flour Industry Association, or the Shanghai Maoxin and other five factories' public agency offices, for approved re-export, regardless of the quality of the flour purchased, should sell it within the amount listed in the Ministry's approval. They must not over-sell or refuse to sell. After selling, they should issue official invoices, affix sufficient stamp duty, and hand them over to the grain merchants, along with the certification documents from their affiliated association, to be submitted to the Ministry for verification. As for the price at which the factories sell flour to grain merchants approved for re-export, it should be based on the allocation price paid by the China Trust Bureau on behalf of Tianjin and Hebei for purchasing flour from the association's factories. They must not raise the price or secretly demand fees. Otherwise, they will be dealt with for manipulating the market and promoting the black market.</p>

<p>Secondly, in terms of finance, the most concerning issue for the public is how to effectively curb inflation. The unavoidable fact is that the issuance of currency is increasing due to insufficient national treasury revenue and expenditure. Therefore, striving to bring national treasury revenue and expenditure closer to balance is indeed an urgent task at present. Furthermore, comparing the index of currency issuance increase with the price index, the current index of currency issuance increase is only about one-fifth of the price increase index. The price index exceeds the currency issuance increase index by more than five times. The main reason is actually caused by the psychological misperceptions of the general public. As long as the government has a method to restore people's trust in the currency, and they do not hoard goods or seek to escape funds, then the impact of the increase in currency on prices will not be as severe as it is today.</p>
<p>What can most affect people's confidence in the currency is the foreign exchange market. Since the Ministry of Finance began implementing foreign exchange control in the 27th year of the Republic (1938) in accordance with government policy, the methods have undergone many evolutions and improvements. However, after reviewing the international economic situation, it seems that our foreign exchange control is not thorough enough, and the execution is not meticulous enough. In all countries of the world, except for a very few countries with abundant strength, strict foreign exchange control policies are implemented to prevent the price of the national treasury currency from being linked to the price of foreign currency. Our country's foreign exchange resources are not abundant, and the industry is lagging behind, and we urgently need to regenerate ourselves. All kinds of unnecessary consumption should be saved as much as possible, so strict foreign exchange control is a necessary measure for promoting economic policy at present. However, some non-essential consumer goods are still widely sold on the market, while some export materials that can be exchanged for foreign exchange in the country are sluggish. Also, the black market trading of foreign exchange and gold outside of the national important financial markets, although prohibitions have been repeatedly issued, is still rampant. The areas near the ports abroad, especially the dens of speculative merchants escaping funds and smuggling goods, have not been effectively isolated. Their impact on the country, these are all weaknesses in foreign exchange control, which need to be corrected by all parties.</p>
<p>Due to the increase in issuance, the fluctuations in prices, and the imperfect foreign exchange management, the related problem is the high rise in interest rates. In March of this year, the interest rate in the Shanghai market once rose to more than four percent per month. Recently, it has been hovering between two and a half and three percent. Inland cities have higher rates than Shanghai, and rural interest rates are even higher. During the war, the issuance gradually increased, and prices inevitably fluctuated, and interest rates tended to rise, which was a natural phenomenon. However, the result of excessively high interest rates is obviously harmful to agricultural, mining, industrial, and commercial production businesses. Also, due to high interest rate costs, it will inevitably promote price increases. In the 36th year of the Republic (1947), the average price increase was 14 times, while the increase in interest rate costs was about 8 times. This clearly shows that high interest rates are the main factor driving up prices. Especially in rural areas, the current general practice of farmers is to use in-kind loans, and the interest rate has reached more than 50%. This kind of usury is becoming increasingly common, which will inevitably lead the majority of farmers to bankruptcy. Not only has it formed a serious economic crisis, but it will also affect the implementation of public administration.</p>
<p>Another issue that is most closely related to financial policy is the adjustment of financial institutions. Our country has a large number of financial institutions, second only to the United States. Since the government promulgated the Emergency Economic Measures Plan in February of the 36th year of the Republic (1947), it has restricted the establishment of new banks and successively eliminated unsound financial institutions. At the end of March of this year, there were a total of 5,912 financial institutions in the country, including 2,090 general institutions and 3,822 branch institutions. If they are listed by nature, there are 4,144 national banks, provincial banks, county and city banks, and commercial banks, 1,147 money houses, 33 trust companies, and 588 insurance companies. Most financial institutions are concentrated in major cities along the Yangtze River and the coast. The Ministry of Finance has made many attempts to promote their relocation to the interior. Recently, it has established financial management bureaus in Shanghai, Tianjin, Guangzhou, and Wuhan to regulate the business operations of banks and money houses. Judging from the current general financial and economic situation, it seems necessary to restrict the establishment of new institutions and eliminate or merge the existing institutions with weak financial strength or unsound business.</p>
<p>The simple analysis above is only to raise the important issues of the current financial situation. From the analysis of various facts, it can be seen that although the current financial problems are serious, improvement is not difficult. As long as the entire country works together, it is easy to reverse the trend, balance revenue and expenditure, rebuild monetary confidence, and stabilize finance within a considerable period of time. From what I can see, I believe that the following matters are particularly worth noting:</p>
<p>First, fiscal policy and financial policy should have a consistent direction and promote progress together. Do not haggle over small profits, and do not worry about difficulties. As for the government's economic policies and general administrative policies, they must also be closely coordinated with fiscal and financial policies, especially in terms of controlling prices and supporting the development of agriculture and industrial and mining production businesses. There must be consistent steps, and the measures should help each other and not conflict or contradict each other.</p>
<p>Second, in order to increase tax revenue, cut spending, and fully control foreign exchange and finance, the entire country must understand the importance of the success or failure of today's fiscal reform, sacrifice the interests of the individual, and support the demands of suppressing the rebellion. All taxes that should be paid should be paid enthusiastically. Expenses that should be cut should be cut effectively. Measures that can reduce the government's burden should be promoted in many ways. All laws and regulations related to the must-control items should be jointly observed and implemented, especially hoping for the support of public opinion organs and the press.</p>
<p>Third, now that constitutional government has begun, the decision-making of fiscal and financial matters should be based on public opinion, but after the policy is determined, the competent authorities should be responsible for its implementation. If obstacles can be removed and difficulties can be overcome, then fiscal reform will definitely be effective. (End)</p>

<p>Suzhou [Our Telegram] Li Qiaosheng, a tenant farmer in Shihuzhen, is over sixty years old. Due to extreme poverty, he was in arrears with his rent and grain. On the 18th of last month, he was detained by the Field Rent Committee and sent to the county government for detention. Li's son, Changgen, fearing that his father was old and frail and could not withstand the hardships of prison, urgently borrowed money from relatives and friends, collected the funds to pay off the grain rent, and paid a portion of the field rent. He then submitted a request to the Field Grain Office for release, but it was ignored. Li Zi could not bear it and today requested a trial from the Wu District Court, and sued County Chief Wang Jiefu, who is also the Director of the Field Grain Office and the Chairman of the Field Rent Committee, for arbitrarily detaining people and interfering with their freedom.

<h3 id="e39">Observing the Annular Solar Eclipse at Ci Biwu <a href="#e39" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c39" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">39</a></h3>
<p>— Our Reporter Huang Xingtian</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Yuhang, Ci Biwu, 9th] May 9th is an extremely precious day for the astronomical community. Astronomers and scientists around the world are full of enthusiasm and hope to welcome this annular solar eclipse.</p>
<p>Entering Our Country</p>
<p>The annular eclipse belt starts in the northeastern part of the Indian Ocean, passes north through Myanmar and Siam, and enters our country southwest of Suixi County in Guangdong, passing through Xinyi, Luoding, Deqing, Guangning, Wude, and Wengyuan counties before entering Jiangxi, passing through Nanxiong, Nankang, Ganxian, Xingguo, Nanfeng, Zixi, Shangrao, and Yushan counties into Zhejiang, passing through Dangshan, FenShui, Lin'an, Yuhang, and Deqing counties, and then through Wujiang and Haimen counties in Jiangsu, before entering the Yellow Sea, crossing southern Korea, entering the Sea of Japan, passing the northwestern tip of Hokkaido, and finally ending in the northeastern corner of the Pacific Ocean. Among them, at 40 degrees 51 minutes north latitude and 132 degrees 47 minutes east longitude in North Korea, when the shadow of the moon is closest to the Earth's surface at 2:30 Greenwich Mean Time, the distance is only eight kilometers, so a brief total solar eclipse can be seen from an airplane. Partial solar eclipses are visible throughout China except for the above-mentioned areas. In the southeast, the fraction of the sun covered reaches more than nine-tenths of the solar disk. The more northwestward, the less the fraction of the sun covered. But even at the border of Xinjiang and Mongolia, partial solar eclipses of more than three-tenths can still be seen.</p>
<p>Cosmic Secrets</p>
<p>A solar eclipse is the best opportunity for the scientific community to explore the mysteries of the universe. It can answer some scientific puzzles and create many new problems. The scientific community hopes to gain the following from this annular solar eclipse: (1) Using the weak light during the solar eclipse to observe whether there are new planets around the sun; (2) Calculating the accurate radius and shape of the Earth from the differences in solar eclipse times at various points in the annular eclipse belt; (3) Measuring the time of the first contact, maximum eclipse, and fourth contact, and the eclipse image. And incidentally measuring the changes in light intensity and temperature during the solar eclipse. The American Geographical Society and the military have prepared for this solar eclipse for a long time and have specially dispatched seven observation teams distributed in Myanmar, Siam, China, Korea, Japan, and the Aleutian Islands (two teams) within the annular eclipse belt. Their main goal is to take the opportunity to conduct geodetic surveys to seek the connection of the measurement networks of various countries. The Astronomical Institute of the Academia Sinica in our country has also paid attention to this solar eclipse for a long time and has specially formed an observation team with the Survey Bureau of the Ministry of National Defense. Their work has three parts: (1) Using the finder scope of the 8-inch equatorial telescope, equipped with a wooden frame that can be rotated up and down, left and right, directly photographing to measure the time of the first contact, the beginning and end of the annular eclipse, and the fourth contact; (2) On the same film, take a picture every ten minutes to capture the eclipse image from the first contact to the fourth contact (such as the one taken in Lintao, Gansu on September 21, 1941, there can be a series of eighteen suns on one photograph); (3) Using a photoelectric tube to measure the change in brightness during the solar eclipse. The observation stations of the Sino-American observation teams are all located in Ci Biwu, forty-three kilometers northeast of Hangzhou.</p>
<p>American Observation Team</p>
<p>The American observation team came to Wukang and Deqing on April 9 to find a base. As a result, it was determined that the top of Dongbu Gang in Ci Biwu, 260 meters above sea level, at 119 degrees 50 minutes 44 seconds east longitude, 30 degrees 26 minutes 25 seconds north latitude, and 2,000 meters from the annular eclipse belt path, was the best location. The team is led by Father Farncis J. Heyden, a professor at Georgetown University in the United States, assisted by Zhang YuZhe, director of the Astronomical Institute of the Academia Sinica, photographer Joe P Gray, and two assistants Sargeant Casteleans and LT. Nelson Fay. They brought radio transmitters, radios, self-recording photometers, chronometers, coelostats, movie cameras equipped with 75.5-inch focal length and 3-inch aperture telescopes, and two standard clocks (one for Greenwich Mean Time, one for local mean time). The Chinese observation team arrived in Ci Biwu three days ago, setting up a station at 119 degrees 50 minutes 30 seconds east longitude and 30 degrees 26 minutes 10 seconds north latitude, on a hillside next to the highway, headed by Chen Diyan and Chen Biao. The staff also included Shi Shiyuan, Xia Jianbai, Yin Zhongqi, Xu Dexiang, Zhou Jiayin, Jiang Bingyu, Yang Xuejun, a total of nine people. Their instruments are relatively simple, with two coelostats, two telescopes, a camera, and several types of photometers, some of which were adapted and manufactured from the sights of Japanese bombers.</p>
<p>No Hope of Sunrise</p>
<p>Yuhang was originally not a suitable place. According to Mr. Chen..., "According to our memory, in the past nine years, there has only been one sunny May 9th here." He said this when the spring sun was warm and the weather was good, but around 4 AM on the 9th, I was awakened by the sound of rain, although it was not very heavy, it did not stop until 6:30, and the layers of dark clouds never dispersed. However, Mr. Zhang YuZhe and others still mustered the courage to climb the muddy hillside and prepare their instruments on the top of the mountain. But time flew by, and there was no hope of sunrise. Father Hayden had no choice but to look up at the Chinese national flag and the Geographical Society flag on the dark sky and sighed. Their work could not be done without the sun. The Chinese observation team at the foot of the mountain was also very discouraged, but they still used photoelectric tubes to measure the change in brightness. This was the only work they could do. They recorded once every five minutes, half an hour before and after the first contact, once every minute, five minutes before and after the first contact, and once every half a minute, two minutes before and after the maximum eclipse, using arcs to indicate brightness. As a result, the first contact was measured at 9:23.4 seconds, the maximum eclipse began at 10:49:25, the darkest was at 28 seconds, the maximum eclipse ended at 32 seconds, and the fourth contact was at 12:18:11, which was consistent with the forecast. (The time calculated by the Zhejiang Provincial Meteorological Institute on Ziyang Mountain in Hangzhou was also very accurate. The first contact in Yuhang County was 9:30:26.8, the maximum eclipse was 10:49:27.5, and the fourth contact was 12:18:08.9.) The ratio of brightness before the first contact to the darkest at maximum eclipse was five hundred to one.</p>
<p>Precious</p>
<p>The observation work of the American observation team in Ci Biwu, China, failed due to the weather. The Chinese observation team also did not have any observational achievements for the same reason. But one thing that is precious is that the eclipse time theoretically calculated is very consistent with the actual situation. This proves the progress of our science. Our country in ancient times paid much attention to astronomical phenomena. The solar eclipse recorded in the "Yin Zheng" chapter of the Book of Documents dates back to before 2100 BC and is the oldest solar eclipse record in the world. The solar eclipse records in the Spring and Autumn period already have research value. In 240 years, as many as 37 solar eclipses were recorded, and most of them are consistent, which is a very valuable achievement. I hope that at the next solar eclipse nineteen years later, our own astronomical community will have even better results.</p>

<h3 id="e40">US and Soviet Union Agree to Improve Relations and Establish Peace Through Direct Negotiations The Full Text of the Exchange of Letters Was Released Yesterday <a href="#e40" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c40" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">40</a></h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] New York, 11th Radio: Washington Dispatch, President Truman's interpretation of Ambassador Smith's views expressed to Molotov as a reaffirmation by the United States government of its basic policy to draw the attention of the Soviet government. There is absolutely no implication of a change in policy on the part of the United States, nor is there any possibility of a meeting between the United States and the Soviet Union as a result. This action is only a reaffirmation of the US position.</p>
<p>[Reuters Moscow, 11th] The Soviet Union and the United States have agreed to resolve all disputes between the two countries through direct negotiations. This great development was revealed this morning after the release of two letters exchanged between US Ambassador to the Soviet Union Smith and Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov. In a letter to Molotov on May 4, Ambassador Smith said that the current relationship between the United States and the Soviet Union is a source of serious disappointment to the American people and government. As far as the United States is concerned, the door to negotiations to resolve differences is always open. Molotov replied that the Soviet government takes a positive attitude towards the US government's desire to improve relations between the two countries and agrees to the suggestion of resolving existing differences between the two countries through negotiations. Ambassador Smith's letter also stated that the concerns and determination of the American people have increased with the Soviet Union's hostile attitude towards the European Recovery Program. The United States believes that this European Recovery Program is nothing more than the reconstruction of Europe with US assistance on a common basis and does not intend to threaten anyone.</p>
<h3 id="e41">US Policy is Firmly Established and Does Not Harbor Hostility Towards the Soviet Union <a href="#e41" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c41" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">41</a></h3>
<p>Smith's letter first put forward the following points: (1) The US government's policy in international affairs has recently been sufficiently affirmative, and most American people support this policy. The US government will continue to implement this policy vigorously in the future, and domestic political situations, such as the US elections this autumn, will have no impact on this policy. The US government is well aware that communist groups in various places are propagating the economic crisis that is about to occur in the United States, which will cause the United States to change its policy. Those who spread such remarks should know that even if the United States has an economic crisis, it will not affect the industrial capacity of the United States or the urgent factors on which its foreign policy is based. Because the problems involved in the current international situation are of great relevance to the security of the United States and global peace. (2) The US government is willing to clearly state that the United States does not harbor a hostile attitude or aggressive intentions towards the Soviet Union. The United States believes that if the Soviet Union is willing to live in peace with its neighbors and does not attempt to directly or indirectly interfere in the affairs of others, then the US policy will not have any unacceptable impact on the interests of the Soviet Union. In fact, if there were no need for the United States to assist other countries in protecting their political integrity and resisting the attempts of communist minority parties to seize power and establish regimes that are subordinate to foreign interests, then many factors in US foreign policy would not elicit such serious criticism from the Soviet Union. If these attempts by communist minority parties cease, then certain expressions in US foreign policy that cause dissatisfaction in Moscow will no longer be necessary.</p>
<p>Smith's letter went on to point out that the current state of US-Soviet relations is the cause of serious disappointment to the American people and government. It also said, "So far, we have not given up hope of changing policies to restore good relations between the two countries and eliminate the causes of the deterioration of the international situation. As far as the United States is concerned, the door to negotiations and the resolution of differences remains open. The US government sincerely hopes that the Soviet leaders will not ignore the US policy explained in this letter, otherwise, the United States will not lack the will and preparation to work on its own to stabilize the world situation under conditions consistent with the security of the Soviet people."</p>
<h3 id="e42">Molotov's Reply: Statement Clarifying Treaties with Allies Did Not Include Secret Clauses <a href="#e42" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c42" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">42</a></h3>
<p>Molotov's letter stated: The Soviet government has received the US Ambassador's letter of May 4 regarding the statement on the state of US-Soviet relations. The Soviet government takes a positive attitude towards the US government's aspiration to improve relations between the two countries, and agrees to begin discussions to resolve the current differences between the two countries. However, the Soviet government also has something it must state.</p>
<p>The US government's assertion that the current unsatisfactory relations between the US and the Soviet Union and the tense international situation are due to the Soviet Union's policies in Eastern Europe and the expansion of Soviet influence is something the Soviet government cannot agree with. Regarding the Soviet Union's relations with its neighbors and other European countries, the Soviet Union dares to state that these relations have greatly improved since the war, as evidenced by the treaties of friendship and mutual assistance concluded between the Soviet Union and these countries. The purpose of these treaties is solely to prevent Germany or its possible allies from launching strategic attacks again, and they do not include any secret clauses. The countries that have treaties with the Soviet Union have all been ravaged by Germany and are eager to conclude such treaties. The Soviet government deeply understands that the US government is also pursuing a policy of strengthening its relations with its neighbors, such as Canada, Mexico, and other American countries. Therefore, it is not difficult to understand that the Soviet Union is pursuing the same policy in Europe, and the Soviet Union will continue to pursue the policy of strengthening its relations with these European countries in the future.</p>
<p>Denies Interference in Other Countries' Internal Affairs</p>
<p>The US government's statement also asserts that certain foreign policies adopted by the US government in some foreign countries, which have caused dissatisfaction in the Soviet Union, are the result of Soviet interference in the internal affairs of these countries, which is also something the Soviet government cannot agree with. Although there have been significant internal reforms in some Eastern European countries after the war, these are measures to prevent new threats of war and have created beneficial conditions for these countries to establish friendly relations with the Soviet Union. To say that these democratic reforms are the result of Soviet interference in their internal affairs is completely wrong, and those who say this ignore the natural result of the victory of democratic forces over fascism. The people of Eastern Europe recognize these reforms as a guarantee against new threats of war, and the people of these countries recognize communists as the most persistent fighters against new wars. Therefore, there is nothing surprising about the fact that communists have risen to leadership positions within these countries. The implementation of democratic reforms is an internal task of the country, and no one has the right to criticize it. However, judging from the US government's statement, the US government clearly has a different opinion on this matter and even allows interference in the internal affairs of other countries, which has inevitably aroused the Soviet government's serious opposition. The situation in Greece is indeed an example of such interference.</p>
<p>Blames the US for Deteriorating Relations</p>
<p>The US government also stated that the current unsatisfactory state of US-Soviet relations is due to the Soviet government's position on the so-called European Recovery Program. We must state here that if the problem of European economic recovery is not carried out in the manner of this so-called European Recovery Program, but is based on the principle of respecting national rights and sovereignty within the United Nations system, and is carried out under normal conditions of international economic cooperation, then the Soviet Union will not oppose a genuine European economic recovery program. The Soviet Union is the country that suffered the most damage during the war, and it has extreme concern and interest in the development of international economic cooperation after the war. At the same time, the Soviet government also wishes to state that the unsatisfactory state of US-Soviet relations and the tense nature of the international situation are the result of the current policies adopted by the US government. The US government's widespread construction of naval, land, and air force bases around the world, including lands adjacent to the Soviet Union, and the fact that US newspapers and some government officials have openly stated that these bases are intended to encircle the Soviet Union, are enough to encourage the creation of the current international tension. These steps by the United States cannot be justified by self-defense, nor can they be used as an excuse to engage in various military threats against the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>Soviet Policy Aims at Peace</p>
<p>On the contrary, the Soviet government has always adopted a peaceful policy towards the United States and other countries, does not establish military bases in other countries, and does not allow itself to threaten any country. Furthermore, the recent conclusion of a military alliance between the five countries of Britain, France, the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg, as well as all mutual assistance treaties concluded by the Soviet Union with Eastern European countries and Britain and France, are aimed at preventing German aggression again and are not directed against any allies. However, judging from the Western European Union Treaty, its target is not only Germany but also all the allied countries in World War II. What is even more important is that the establishment of the Western European five-nation military alliance was realized because of the US government's sponsorship. The Western European five-nation military alliance is clearly not a treaty for self-defense.</p>
<p>Trade Discrimination is Intolerable</p>
<p>Looking at US-Soviet trade relations, the unfriendly attitude of the US government towards the Soviet Union is also fully displayed. According to the US-Soviet trade agreement, the US can only impose restrictions on exports to the Soviet Union that are also applied to any other third country. However, in fact, the current policy implemented by the US government imposes discriminatory restrictions on exports to the Soviet Union, which directly violates the provisions of the US-Soviet trade agreement. Although the Soviet Union has paid part or even all of the price for goods to be shipped to the Soviet Union, it is still subject to various obstacles, and its intolerable nature is obvious. Now, the US government states that it has no hostility or intention to invade the Soviet Union, hopes to establish good relations between the two countries, eliminate international tension, and expresses its willingness to encourage the overall stability of the world situation under conditions consistent with Soviet security. The Soviet government welcomes this statement from the US government. It is well known that the Soviet government has consistently adopted a policy of peaceful cooperation with the US, and the Soviet people unanimously support this policy. The Soviet government also declares that it will continue to implement this policy in the future. The Soviet government also hopes to find ways to eliminate existing discrimination, establish good relations between the US and the Soviet Union, and strengthen global peace. Ambassador Smith has agreed to forward Molotov's letter to the US government.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper] London, 11th Radio: Berlin News, US Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Smith, traveled to France, passing through here. He was deeply surprised by the Soviet Union's sudden public announcement of the content of his discussions with Molotov, because both parties had previously agreed to keep it secret.</p>
<p>[Reuters Berlin, 11th] US Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Smith, passed through here today on his way back to the US and said that the Soviet Union's publication of the content of his conversation with Molotov was a breach of confidentiality, because he believed that his contact with Molotov was completely confidential.

<p>[United Press Washington, 10th] Under Secretary of the Army Draper, who recently inspected Japan and returned, presented his views to the House Military Subcommittee today, advocating the use of American cotton and wool to revive the Japanese textile industry. It is said that this plan is sufficient to reduce occupation costs and enable Japan to become economically self-sufficient. The rehabilitation plan applies to all occupied areas, but Japan benefits the most. The Department of the Army currently hopes that the Japanese textile industry will restore a quarter of its pre-war production capacity by the end of 1949, that is, even if three million spindles are put into operation.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency Tokyo, 11th] It is reported that the Japanese Economic Stabilization Board has increased the planned production volume of rayon in the first quarter of this fiscal year from the original 8.4 million pounds to 9.5 million pounds.</p>
<h3 id="e46">Soviet People Excited, London Expresses Gratification <a href="#e46" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c46" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">46</a></h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] New York, 11th Radio: Moscow News, The Soviet people seem to have responded well to the US proposal to improve US-Soviet relations. The Moscow radio station broadcast this news at least twice. Major newspapers such as Pravda, Izvestia, and Labor Daily all revealed the battle in prominent positions, occupying a lot of space. US Ambassador to the Soviet Union Smith went to Qia today. When he went to the airport, the embassy staff did not know about this matter, but they already knew about the recent meeting between Smith and Molotov. The first person in the embassy to learn about this news was Smith himself. He heard it from the broadcast of the All India Radio Station. However, American observers cannot express optimism about the Soviet response, because the Soviet note strongly stated that the Soviet Union will continue its policy of consolidating relations with Eastern European countries, just as the United States is consolidating its relations with neighboring countries.</p>
<p>[Reuters London, 11th] After the news of the US and the Soviet Union agreeing to discuss resolving the differences between the two countries was announced, people in London felt happy. People here pointed out that when Marshall testified to the House Foreign Affairs Committee last Wednesday, he had already revealed the US's willingness to obtain understanding with the Soviet Union. Marshall also believed that the current Soviet foreign policy was due to misunderstandings about the motives of Western countries. What Marshall wants now is to find a way to adjust this misunderstanding. Political figures here also believe that Marshall's contact with the Soviet Union was launched because they saw that the crisis in Berlin was becoming increasingly serious and would lead to a war-like situation. However, people in London do not underestimate the major difficulties in the US and the Soviet Union's interests tending to harmony. It is remembered that former Secretary of State Byrnes also tried to revive this institution after the first breakdown of the Foreign Ministers Conference in the autumn of 1945. Although the Foreign Ministers Conference was revived later, it only lasted for two years before ending in a breakdown.</p>

Reports from remote areas of South Korea show that the riots during the election have subsided, but late reports show that the death toll continues to increase compared to yesterday's reports. Several ballot boxes on Yeouido were destroyed before they were opened. Seoul police authorities confirmed that North Korean troops had crossed the 38th parallel into South Korea twice yesterday and exchanged fire with South Korean police. Both times were near Kaesong. Pyongyang Radio today once again threatened to cut off the electricity supply from North Korea to South Korea, claiming that if the South Korean representatives do not go to North Korea to negotiate the electricity bill before May 10, the electricity supply will be cut off.</p>

<p>[Reuters Rome, 11th] When the Italian Senate and House of Representatives resumed the presidential election on the 11th, both of the most advantageous candidates in yesterday's election, interim President Nicola and Foreign Minister Sforza, had declared their withdrawal from the election. In yesterday's second vote, Sforza received 405 votes and Nicola received 336 votes. After the Social Unity Party, which occupies 7% of the seats in the parliament, declared that it did not intend to support Sforza, Sforza announced his withdrawal from the election, and the Christian Democratic Party decided to order its members to support Budget Minister Einaudi, who has made great contributions to stabilizing Italy's finances after the war, as president. As for Nicola, he withdrew from the election on the grounds of poor health.</p>
<p>[United Press Rome, 11th] The Italian parliament held a third vote today to elect a president, but the results of the ballot still failed to determine the overall situation. As soon as the joint session of the Senate and the House of Representatives began, 140 members of the Communist Party, the left-wing Socialist Party, the Transcendental faction, and small groups withdrew from the meeting, resulting in the result of the vote not reaching the required two-thirds majority, which is 600 votes. The right-wing Socialist Party and the Republican Party both cast blank ballots, indicating that the left is not bound by the fundamentalist Democratic Party and Prime Minister Gasperi. Einaudi's election as President of Italy seems to be a foregone conclusion, as all parties have agreed to support him in the fourth vote.</p>

<h3 id="e52">Special Relief Donation Fundraising Committee Meeting: Decides to Invite Trade Associations and Clan Associations to Launch Free Donations from All Walks of Life, Considers It Unfair to Increase the Donation Amount in the Shanghai Area Alone <a href="#e52" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c52" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">52</a></h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] The Shanghai Special Relief Donation Fundraising Committee held its fourth meeting at the city government conference room at 3:00 pm yesterday. Chairman Wu Guozhen, Vice Chairman Du Yuesheng, Committee members Xu Jiyu, Qian Yongming, Wang Yiting, Fang Zhi, Wu Kaixian, Wu Yuncong, Wang Xianqing, Qin Runqing, Zhang Qiang of the Hangzhou sub-district (representing Xu Jiyu), Yan Xinqi of the Suzhou sub-district (representing Yan Xuehui), and Li Tiping of the Wuxi sub-district (representing Tang Min) attended. Central Supervisory Committee member Jiang Tang also attended and participated. The meeting decided that at 3:00 pm on May 26, all committee members will invite the chairmen of various trade associations and the presidents of various clan associations to hold a meeting to launch free donations from all walks of life, with the deadline being the end of June. The total amount of special donations in the Shanghai area was originally 5.5 trillion, but the Executive Yuan's Special Promotion Supervisory Committee decided to increase it by 3 trillion, for a total of 8.5 trillion. Yesterday's meeting discussed this matter by various committee members, believing that it is unfair to only increase the amount in the Shanghai area. They requested that Committee member Jiang Yong go to Beijing to present his views to the central government, stating that if an increase is necessary, it should be a universal increase in all areas across the country.</p>

<p>According to Chairman Wu's statement to reporters, the city government has prepared a list of special donation targets, with thousands of people listed. However, the list will not be announced for the time being. Free donations will be launched first, with the deadline being the end of June. If donations are overdue, the names of the provinces listed will be announced again, awaiting public opinion sanctions. The more special donations raised, the better. 8.5 trillion or 5.5 trillion are only used as targets and not as limits.</p>
<p>In addition, the promotion of special donations has been decided to focus on relieving refugees and doing good deeds to encourage them. The third meeting had resolved to use a portion of the special donations raised for the purpose of relieving refugees in the city so that local people can actively participate in inspections. The Supervisory Committee has now telegraphed that the principle is feasible and will be submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval. In addition, the third meeting decided that people related to politics on the list of special donation targets will not be nominated locally. The central government telegraphed on this point that local nominations can be made to open the list and secretly submit it to the central government for approval.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper] Mayor Wu summoned Xu Songren, the management committee of the north and south rice markets, at 9:00 am yesterday to verify the prices of San, Yin Fuxiang, Hu Wen'an, and others. The mayor stated that the stability of rice prices in the city for the past two months was the result of cooperation between rice merchants and the government. However, in the past ten days, rice prices have soared by more than 1 million, 45 percent higher than before, which is unreasonable. Food rice cannot be compared to gold coins, so I hope that the market management committee and rice merchants will assist the government in suppressing the rising trend. The rice merchants said that market price fluctuations are affected by the place of production and hope to dredge up the source and ask the central government to suppress prices in the place of production so that the city can be stabilized. In addition to hoping that rice merchants will cooperate with the government, the mayor also stated that if the rising trend does not stop, the Civil Food Allocation Committee is ready to sell at any time.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper] Regarding whether to continue to pay rewards for cracking down on black market gold and currency cases, the person in charge of the Gold Control Bureau stated: These rewards are still being paid. According to Article 5 of the Regulations on Penalties for Buying and Selling Gold and Foreign Currency, which was amended and promulgated by the Legislative Yuan on December 9 last year, all confiscated items should be turned over to the national treasury. Therefore, since the publication of these regulations, gold and currency confiscated for illegal buying and selling cannot be given a percentage as a reward according to law. However, the Ministry of Finance believes that the above regulations may lose the meaning of rewards and has specifically requested the Executive Yuan to allow the confiscated gold and currency and fines to be handled in accordance with the original methods of the Ministry of Finance. The case is being consulted by the Executive Yuan to the Legislative Yuan for amendment and approval. Before it is announced, all gold and currency confiscated for illegal buying and selling are allowed to continue to be converted and rewarded in order to avoid affecting the rewarding of informants.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper] Responsible persons from various departments of the Jinghu District Railway Administration have held meetings for several days, which is said to be discussing the issue of price increases.

Moreover, in the May price surge, railway essential materials such as fuel and hardware have increased significantly. Therefore, fare increases on both lines for passengers and freight are inevitable, and are now only awaiting the approval of the Ministry of Transportation. It is reported that the percentage of the adjustment applied to the Ministry of Transportation by the Bureau is 50%.</p>

<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Zhou Su'e, a 23-year-old woman from Wujin, residing at No. 29 Daqing Lane, Nanjing Road, committed suicide by drinking poison around 4 PM yesterday due to a love triangle. Her close friend Wu Qiushan discovered her and accompanied her to Nanyang Hospital for treatment, but it was ineffective. She passed away half an hour later. The Laozha Police Sub-bureau dispatched officers to investigate and learned that her lover was named Xie Kongzhao, who worked for a railway bureau. They also found more than ten love letters from Xie to the woman. Judging from the tone of the letters, it seemed that the woman and Xie became acquainted and developed a relationship at the Aiwen Hotel last autumn. Since then, their feelings grew deeper, and they went out together once a week. Later, the woman discovered that Xie had bad habits and repeatedly advised him to change: (1) quit gambling, (2) quit smoking, (3) quit drinking, and (4) be trustworthy. She said that if he did not change, she would marry someone else. Recently, the woman suddenly became pregnant and could not hide it from her parents. At the same time, she became passionately involved with a person named "A Hui." Xie seemed unable to let go of the woman. Faced with blaming herself for loving the wrong person on one hand and feeling ashamed to face "A Hui" on the other, the woman resorted to the last resort of suicide.</p>

A quarrel broke out over a dispute over prostitutes, and they scheduled a gang fight. Each side carried weapons such as large knives, iron bars, and iron rulers. At a signal, they charged and clashed in a melee that lasted about fifteen minutes before dispersing. As a result, three or four people sustained minor injuries, and Chen Genlin sustained serious injuries with two knife wounds to the head. All were sent to Renji Hospital for treatment. Those with minor injuries returned after being bandaged. At 11:20 PM, one of the defeated groups regrouped, secretly carrying weapons, and ambushed Weng Bingyuan (22 years old), a hooligan, near Huile Lane on Yunnan Road, slashing his head, and Jiang Guoqi (25 years old) in the left foot. The perpetrators scattered. The two wounded were sent to the hospital for treatment. Currently, the police are pursuing the main offenders of both gangs for investigation.</p>

<p>Meixing Watch Shop and Others Jointly Appeal</p>
<p>Meixing Watch Shop at No. 354 Nanjing East Road, Damei Printing and Dyeing Factory at No. 356, Yongfengyu Silver Shop at No. 360, and Tianbaocheng Silver Shop at No. 364 have been renting their premises for many years. Recently, Jinyuan Money Exchange raised funds to purchase the properties and notified the tenants to vacate, claiming that the buildings need to be renovated. The tenants argue that the buildings were previously repaired by the tenants themselves at their own expense not long ago and are still very strong. At a time when there is a serious housing shortage, there is no need for renovation. In addition to protesting to the relevant authorities and forming a joint association of tenants on Nanjing Road, appealing to all sectors to uphold justice, they have also hired lawyers as legal advisors.</p>

<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] An overseas Chinese delegate to the National Assembly who has returned to Shanghai told our reporter yesterday that with the imminent establishment of a constitutional government, prices are soaring, and money and food are rising sharply, but the government is doing nothing, losing the people's trust. Exports have long been suspended, overseas remittances have disappeared, and recently, the method of daily exchange settlement for imports has been changed, which is driving the import trade to the brink of extinction. Coupled with high-interest policies, this is fueling further price increases, which will inevitably lead to the impoverishment of the people. Therefore, the upcoming constitutional government must reform personnel and change policies to gain the people's trust. We hope that the government will immediately change course and give people a fresh start, so that the country can be stabilized, built, and succeed.</p>

<h3 id="e96">The National Games Athletics Program Successfully Concludes; Taiwan and Qingdao Secure Men's and Women's Championships Respectively; Lou Wen'ao's 10,000-Meter Time, Though Good, Falls Short of Ideal; Swimming Competition Begins Today; Key Battles in Soccer and Basketball <a href="#e96" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c96" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">96</a></h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] After the rain cleared, various competitions of the National Games continued yesterday. On the final day of athletics, all events concluded successfully. Taiwan and Qingdao won the men's and women's championships, respectively. In men's athletics, Taiwan scored 155 points to win the championship, followed by the Air Force with 69 points, Shanghai with 61 points, the Navy with 45 points, and Malaya with 26 points. In women's athletics, Qingdao saw a surge in points yesterday, securing the championship with 47 points, followed by Hebei with 37 points, Guangdong in third place with 33 points, Taiwan in fourth, Fujian in fifth, and Beiping in sixth. New records continued to emerge yesterday. Lou Wen'ao, the center of attention, won the 10,000-meter race in 32 minutes and 47 seconds, breaking the national record, but unfortunately, it did not reach his ideal time, being a minute slower than his performance in the United States. Huang and Liang Zheng from Malaya broke the national record in the intermediate hurdles with 57.9 seconds, the most outstanding performance of the day. Over the past four days, a total of five new national records were set in men's events: 400 meters, 5,000 meters, 10,000 meters, intermediate hurdles, and discus; and three in women's events: hurdles (preliminary), shot put, and high jump. New meet records were set in three men's events: 1,500 meters, high hurdles, and shot put; and one women's event: 100 meters. The gains are abundant, and should be considered satisfactory.</p>
<p>Following athletics, the swimming competition begins today, promising a grand spectacle. Today's soccer and basketball championship round-robin tournaments feature key battles, with Shanghai facing the Army in soccer, and the Police facing Hong Kong. The athletics field will again be crowded with spectators. The men's and women's basketball championship round-robin tournaments already began yesterday and will continue today. Other events, including men's and women's tennis, table tennis, softball, and volleyball, have also entered critical stages.</p>
<h3 id="e97">80,000 Spectators Watch the 10,000-Meter Showdown; "Silent General" Lou Wen'ao Leads All the Way; Breaks National Record with 32 Minutes and 47 Seconds <a href="#e97" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c97" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">97</a></h3>
<p>— Our Reporter Zhang Shengzhi</p>
<p>[Special Report from Our Newspaper] The 10,000-meter final was the highlight of the athletics competition. Approximately 80,000 spectators, drawn by the name of the "Silent General" Lou Wen'ao, watched from the sidelines.</p>
<p>In the end, Lou Wen'ao broke Sun Che's national record of 34 minutes and 1.1 seconds with a time of 32 minutes and 47 seconds, but this was still far from his personal best of 31 minutes and 27.8 seconds.</p>
<p>Lou Wen'ao had previously tried wearing spiked shoes in the 5,000-meter race but felt uncomfortable. Therefore, yesterday he reverted to wearing rubber-soled running shoes, but this still did not produce a satisfactory result. Since returning from the United States, Lou Wen'ao has seemed to be in poor form.</p>
<p>An analysis of the reasons for Lou Wen'ao's relatively poor performance yesterday: the deliberate obstruction by several runners halfway through the race was the biggest factor. This disrupted the consistent pace of his "long-distance machine," causing fluctuations in speed. To avoid this intentional obstruction, Lou had to accelerate and run around the outside lane, resulting in a "case of doing more work for less result," wasting much energy and losing more than 30 seconds.</p>
<h3 id="e98">The Record Was Not as Ideal; The First Half Was Satisfactory <a href="#e98" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c98" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">98</a></h3>
<p>According to the advice of American athletics coaches: to shorten Lou Wen'ao's time, the first and most basic step is to switch to spiked shoes. Therefore, until Lou Wen'ao becomes accustomed to wearing spiked shoes, it is virtually impossible for him to break the 31-minute barrier in the 10,000 meters.</p>
<p>Analyzing the timing: for Lou Wen'ao to enter the 31-minute range, the average time for each lap (500 meters) must not exceed 1 minute and 33 seconds. However, yesterday his average time was 1 minute and 35.35 seconds. Except for the first three laps and the last lap, which were of a reasonable standard, most of the other sixteen laps exceeded 1 minute and 40 seconds.</p>
<p>Comparatively speaking: Lou Wen'ao's time at the 5,000-meter mark was 15 minutes and 59 seconds, a slight improvement over his official 5,000-meter race time of 16 minutes and 4/5 seconds. However, for the sake of setting a new record, this result was not satisfactory. At least the time for the first half of the race should have been within 15 minutes and 30 seconds for an ideal record.</p>
<p>Another reason: Lou Wen'ao is accustomed to running on a 400-meter track, so he inevitably lost some accuracy and control in calculating the distance and time on a 500-meter track. All of these factors contributed to his decline in performance.</p>
<p>However, setting aside the record, Lou Wen'ao's relaxed and springy stride throughout the entire race, always leading and dominating the field, was still an exciting spectacle.</p>
<p>He left the second-place finisher, Qingdao's Liu Jingli, about 450 meters behind, and was even 600 meters ahead of the third-place finisher, Lao Yu, giving the more than 80,000 spectators a great show.</p>
<p>The fourth-place finisher was Yu Shengquan from Hebei Province, who finished about 30 seconds behind Lao Yu. Chen Wansheng from Taiwan finished fifth, and An Benquan from the Joint Logistics Command managed to secure sixth place after a hard fight.</p>

<p>There were 36 runners at the start of the 10,000-meter race. The race unfolded as follows:</p>
<p>At the sound of the gun, Lou Wen'ao surged ahead of the pack at high speed. After 750 meters, the long line of runners resembled a string of ribbonfish in motion. Lou took large strides at the front, followed by Liu Jingli, Yu Qing, An Benquan, Gan Xiwei, Yu Shengquan, and Chen Wansheng.</p>
<p>Two and a half laps (1,250 meters): Lou Wen'ao pulled 30 meters ahead of the main group. Liu Jingli, Ping Xiwei, and Chen Wansheng followed closely behind, with An Benquan and Yu Shengquan slightly further back.</p>
<p>Three and a half laps (1,750 meters): Lou Wen'ao led by 50 meters. Yu Xiwei overtook Liu Jingxian, while Chen Wansheng remained in fourth place. Yu Shengquan began to pass An Benquan.</p>
<p>Four and a half laps (2,250 meters): Lou Wen'ao was about to catch up with the last few runners, and the stands erupted in applause. At that time, Yu Xiwei, Liu Jingkun, and Chen Wansheng were locked in a tight battle. By the end of the fifth lap, Lou Wen'ao had overtaken the last three runners.</p>
<p>Five and a half laps (2,750 meters): Lou Wen'ao pulled 120 meters ahead of the second-place runner. The other positions remained largely unchanged.</p>
<p>Six and a half laps (3,250 meters): Lou Wen'ao extended his lead by another 40 meters. Yu Xiwei and Liu Jingkun were fiercely competing for second place. At that point, it seemed like Lou Wen'ao was putting on a performance, while Yu and Liu were actually racing!</p>
<p>Seven and a half laps (3,750 meters): Lou Wen'ao was now 200 meters ahead of the second-place runner. Liu Jingkun began to overtake Gan Xiwei. The other positions remained largely unchanged.</p>
<p>Eight and a half laps (4,250 meters): Yu Xiwei regained second place, temporarily overtaking Liu Jingkun. Lou Wen'ao continued to pull away, now 230 meters ahead of them.</p>
<p>Nine and a half laps (4,750 meters): Everything remained the same, with little change.</p>
<p>Ten and a half laps (5,250 meters): Lou Wen'ao was almost a full lap ahead of the main group.</p>
<p>Eleven and a half laps (5,750 meters): The battle for second place intensified. Liu Jingkun once again overtook Yu Xiwei, extending his lead to five meters. Chen Wansheng and Yu Shengquan remained in fourth and fifth place, respectively. An Benquan remained in sixth place. At this point, the overall situation seemed to be settled.</p>
<p>Twelve and a half laps (6,150 meters): The situation was similar to the previous lap.</p>
<p>Thirteen and a half laps (6,750 meters): Lou Wen'ao's pace remained largely unchanged. Yu Xiwei gradually lost the courage to compete for second place and fell 20 meters behind. Finally, Lou Wen'ao began to catch up with Yu Shengguo, who was then in fifth place.</p>
<p>Fourteen and a half laps (7,250 meters): No change.</p>
<p>Fifteen and a half laps (7,750 meters): Lou Wen'ao further caught up with Chen Wansheng, who was then in fourth place.</p>
<p>Sixteen and a half laps (8,250 meters): The top three positions were largely settled. Chen Wansheng, the Taiwanese athlete who was originally in fourth place, gradually slowed down. In contrast, Yu Shengquan from Hebei had plenty of stamina left and was gaining momentum.</p>
<p>Seventeen and a half laps (8,750 meters): Chen Wansheng began to fall behind. Yu Shengquan took fourth place.</p>
<p>Eighteen and a half laps (9,250 meters): The overall situation remained largely unchanged.</p>

<p>200-Meter Final In the men's 200-meter final, it was widely believed to be a battle between Shanghai and Taiwan. There were four athletes from Taiwan, two from Shanghai, one from Malaya, and one from Qingdao. Shanghai's Rong Chengbiao had a strong finish and was capable of competing with the Taiwanese athletes. However, in the end, the top three places were all taken by Taiwan. Rong Chengbiao managed to finish fourth, and Taiwan took fifth place. Malaya finished sixth. Xu Tong took the lead at the start. Rong Chengbiao and the other three Taiwanese athletes were in a line at the 100-meter mark, but in the last 20 meters, Rong Chengbiao lacked the stamina to maintain his position and fell back to fourth place. Xu Tong finished first, followed by Xu Tiande and Chen Yinglang in second and third place, respectively. The time of 23.4 seconds was only average. It was later said that Rong Chengbiao's running shoes were damaged, and he borrowed Wu Zhonghai's shoes, which were too big for him to run effectively. It is difficult to win when athletes are not prepared beforehand.</p>
<p>400-Meter Intermediate Hurdles The intermediate hurdles final was another masterpiece by Malaya's Huang and Liang Zheng, following his high hurdles final. It was also one of the more exciting events of yesterday's athletics competition, even more so than the 10,000-meter race. Huang and Liang Zheng broke Cheng Jinguan's national record of 58.3 seconds with a time of 57.9 seconds. He was almost a hurdle ahead of the second-place finisher, Lu Zuofu from Tianjin. Huang and Liang Zheng's start was strong, his strides were wide and accurate, and his hurdling seemed rhythmic. He reached the finish line, but it was a pity that photographers were taking pictures, otherwise his performance might have been even better. Zhang Zhiqing from the Navy finished third, followed by Lai Youde from Taiwan, Ma Guoquan from Chongqing, and Rui Shizhen from the Army.</p>
<p>1,600-Meter Relay The 1,600-meter relay final was another victory for the Taiwanese athletes. The four Taiwanese runners led all the way, finishing well ahead of the second-place Shanghai team by about 30 meters. The competition between the Shanghai team and the Beiping team was fierce, with only a small difference between them. The team lists are as follows:</p>
<p>Fourth Runner Chen Yinglang Rong Chengbiao Ren Yao</p>
<p>Women's 60-Meter Final In the women's 60-meter final, Wang Shugui from Qingdao won first place again after her victory in the 100 meters, sweeping the women's sprint titles. Yu Renjia from Nanjing had the fastest start and finished second. Wang Shugui only began to surge after 50 meters, accelerating to the finish line. Li Xinyi from Chongqing was only a shoulder-width behind Yu Renjia, making it difficult to distinguish between them. The fourth, fifth, and sixth places, Li Xiaobi, Guo Meili, and Zou Kaichun, were also only a step apart. The time of 8.3 seconds was good. Because the 60 meters is a new event, there are no records to compare it with.</p>
<p>Women's 200-Meter Final In the women's 200-meter final, Wang Shugui's strength was insufficient, and she was defeated by Chen Biying from Fujian, finishing second. Chen Biying's endurance was superior, and her speed increased greatly after 100 meters. Wang Shugui's body and legs were thicker, making her less suited for longer distances. She finished about a meter behind Chen Biying. Li Xinyi was small and finished fourth. Jiang Kangri, the daughter of Jiang Guangding, finished third. The two Guangdong athletes, Li Xiaojiong and Mei Shunyan, were too petite and finished fifth and sixth. Lin Baijiao from Taiwan and Feng Ziqin from Hankou failed to qualify.</p>
<p>Women's 400-Meter Relay The women's 400-meter relay final was the key to Qingdao's victory, adding 14 points to their total and securing the women's athletics championship with 47 points. At the start, Zhao Hong from Hebei took the lead. Mei Shunyan from Guangdong and Wang Jirong from Qingdao followed behind. In the third leg, Jiang Kangri from Guangdong overtook Zhang Qi from the Hebei team, while Shu Shulong from the Qingdao team was running neck and neck with the Guangdong team. In the fourth leg, Wang Shugui used her fastest speed to win first place. Li Xiaofeng from Guangdong finished second, very close behind. Wang Leyi from Hebei finished third. The Taiwanese athletes were not skilled in baton passing and finished fourth.</p>
<p>Men's 800-Meter Final Veteran Yu Xiwei won the championship in 2 minutes and 6.4 seconds, winning very easily. Li Helong from Liaoning was also quite strong and had a fierce competition with Yu, but in the last 50 meters, his sprint skills were lacking, and Yu pulled ahead by three meters. It was a case of superior skill. The strength of the four runners behind them was very even, and they finished very close together. Ni Si from the Army finished third, followed by Che Keying from the Joint Logistics Command, Song Wenjian from Qingdao, and Ma Liancheng from Hebei.</p>

<h3 id="e102">Zhang Ruiyan Throws with Her Fair Arm; Women's Javelin Throw Result is 27.84 Meters; Chen Lilang Light as a Swallow; Pole Vault Record is 3.52 Meters; Review of Two Field Events <a href="#e102" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c102" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">102</a></h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Yesterday's field events consisted of the women's javelin throw and the men's pole vault finals. Both events were only average in terms of results. The pole vault was a very intense competition. The events began at 2:30 PM and lasted until 6:00 PM. A brief overview of the two events is as follows:</p>
<p>Women's Javelin Throw, 29 registered athletes, but only 17 actually participated. In the three preliminary throws, only six athletes exceeded 23 meters. During her three throws, Zhang Ruiyan from Taiwan ran and charged, throwing with her fair arm, achieving 27.84 meters. Xiao Sun threw three more times, achieving a maximum score of 27.52 meters, which angered her greatly. The rankings and results are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Zhang Ruiyan (Taiwan) 27.84 meters</p>
<p>(2) Sun Suxia (Qingdao) 27.52 meters</p>
<p>(3) Zhou Zufin (Shanghai) 24.97 meters</p>
<p>(4) Yin Yunyin (Hebei) 24.61 meters</p>
<p>(5) Song Jinhuan (Fujian) 23.68 meters</p>
<p>(6) Hu Cuihua (Beijing) 23.01 meters</p>
<p>Men's Pole Vault, starting at 2:30 PM, with 28 athletes registering. The competition was slow, starting at 2.80 meters. By 4:30 PM, the bar was only raised to 3.20 meters. Ten athletes still managed to clear it. At 5:00 PM, the bar was raised to 3.30 meters. Only Huang Jian from the Air Force and Zhang Lilang from Taiwan cleared it on their first attempt. The other athletes failed to clear it after three attempts. When the height was raised to 3.40 meters, Huang Jian cleared it with ease on his first attempt. Lilang failed on his first attempt but cleared it on his second attempt. At 3.46 meters, Huang Jian sprinted from a distance with the pole, eliciting cheers from the audience. His posture in the air was truly ethereal. At this point, Lilang's leg muscles began to weaken, but he did not lose heart and managed to clear the bar again. When the bar was raised to 3.52 meters, Huang Jian was too careless on his first attempt. His body cleared the bar, but his hand knocked the bar down. At this moment, Lilang suddenly seemed to receive an injection of adrenaline. He ran calmly with the pole, performed a clean and crisp somersault, and cleared the bar, reversing his previous sluggish form. This jump shocked Huang, causing him to become disoriented. On his second attempt, his legs became entangled with the pole, and he fell to the ground before clearing the bar, injuring his leg. After trying to run twice, he was unable to jump again and had to reluctantly give up the championship he had not yet won. With only Lilang left to jump, he was ambitious and raised the bar to 3.60 meters. However, he was exhausted and failed on two attempts, automatically giving up on his third attempt. As a result, the highest score was only 3.52 meters. The three-and-a-half-hour-long battle resulted in a score that was still a foot and a half short of Fu Wang's (Bao Lu's) old record. The rankings and scores are listed below:</p>
<p>(1) Zhang Lilang (Taiwan) 3.52 meters</p>
<p>(2) Huang Jian (Air Force) 3.46 meters</p>
<p>(3) Yu Tiejun (Guangdong) 3.20 meters</p>
<p>(4) Chen Shuhuang (Guangdong) 3.20 meters</p>
<p>(5) Chen Liang (Police) 3.20 meters</p>
<p>(6) Lu Tiezhong (Army) 3.20 meters</p>

<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] At 10:25 AM yesterday, before the start of the competition, when there were few spectators in the athletics field, a gunshot suddenly rang out in the north stands, causing a spectator to fall to the ground. After investigation by reporters, it was revealed that Zhang Wenlong, a police officer from the Sixth Squadron of the Security Police, had given his pistol to his colleague, Yang Hua. However, the gun was loaded with ten bullets, and it was accidentally triggered, causing a bullet to enter Yang's left calf. Bleeding profusely, he collapsed to the ground. An ambulance arrived and took the injured officer to the police hospital for treatment.</p>

<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The highly anticipated soccer championship round-robin tournament officially begins today. At 2:00 PM, Shanghai will face the Army, and at 4:00 PM, the Police will face Hong Kong. Both matches will be held at the main athletics field. According to the single round-robin system, each of the four teams will only have three opportunities to compete. Each win earns two points, a draw earns one point for each team, and a loss earns no points. Therefore, today's matches between the four teams will directly affect the contenders for the championship. In other words, if the Police lose to Hong Kong, or the Army lose to Shanghai, any team that loses once will have significantly reduced hopes of winning the championship. Therefore, it is expected that all four teams will give their all to compete at that time. The possible lineups for each team today are as follows:</p>
<p>Police Team:</p>
<p>Yu Yaode, Zeng Zhongyun, Zheng Yingquan, Mo Jinsong, Liu Tianshen, You Huaxing, Liu Qingcai, Tan Zhenhui, Tan Huanzhang, Zhao Fu, Li Bingzhao, Xie Jinhe</p>

Wang Shixuan committed his fifth foul and left the field, and Bu Yanshi entered as a substitute without reporting to the scorer, and was penalized for a foul. Wu Chengzhang and Cai Zhongqiang both missed their free throws, but Cai Wenhua made a shot, tying the score at 37-37. Bao Songyuan made a basket under the basket, making it 39-37. With little time remaining, Li Zhenzhong and Liao Dihang fouled out, and Shanghai adopted passing tactics to consume time, and ultimately maintained the victory with this valuable goal. It was also fortunate.</p>

<h3 id="e107">Today's Men's Basketball Round-Robin Schedule: Shanghai and Philippine Nationals Face Police and Combined Services Separately; Shanghai Should Be Calm, Combined Services Should Not Be Too Nervous <a href="#e107" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c107" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">107</a></h3>
<p>[Our Report] There are two men's basketball round-robin matches today: (1) Shanghai vs. Police, (2) Combined Services vs. Philippine Nationals. The Shanghai team has many talented players, and this reporter believes that it is not advisable to fight with only these five players as in the game on the 11th. When stamina is lacking, fresh troops should be brought on stage. If the game is played in the same way as on the 11th, it may not be easy to win. Having learned from the Philippine Nationals, the Police should deal with the game against Shanghai with more composure.</p>
<p>The Combined Services excels in electric warfare tactics, strong cutting, and bold shooting; while the Philippine Nationals are good at using feints to lure the enemy and break in to score. A fierce battle is inevitable when the two teams meet. However, if the Combined Services can improve their shooting accuracy, they may be able to win. If they are too nervous, they may be defeated by the Philippine Nationals.</p>
<p>The 13th should be the final battle for the championship, Shanghai vs. the Philippine Nationals. This reporter believes that the key to victory lies in Shanghai's spirit of cooperation. The sum of the individual skills of the Shanghai team is better than that of the Philippine Nationals, but unfortunately, due to the lack of ideal cooperation, a lot of effort is wasted. The Philippine Nationals have staying power, and if Shanghai is exhausted, it could create an opportunity for the Philippine Nationals to benefit. (Yusheng)</p>
<h3 id="e108">First Act of the Women's Basketball Round-Robin Tournament: Fujian Reverses the Situation, Shanghai Sharply Defeats Indonesia <a href="#e108" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c108" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">108</a></h3>
<p>[Our Report] There were two women's basketball round-robin matches yesterday. As a result, the Philippines first prospered and then declined, performing abnormally in the last few minutes, losing to Fujian with a score of 21-28. Indonesia also lost to the sharp offensive of the Shanghai team with a score of 32-41, due to being unfamiliar with indoor combat. The details of the battles are as follows:</p>
<p>Philippine Nationals First Prosper and Then Decline</p>
<p>The game between Fujian and the Philippine Nationals began at 2:00 PM. One minute into the game, Fujian's Huang Guiying committed a foul, and the Philippine National's Yang Xiuzhi missed the free throw. Huang Rulan intercepted the ball and made a brave shot, giving the Philippine Nationals a 2-0 lead. After a while, Philippine Cai Shuqiong committed a foul, and Fujian's Huang Guiying missed the free throw. Philippine National's Chen Yujian scored two points, and Fujian's Chen Jucai returned the favor, and Xu Xinxi also scored two points. Then, Fujian's Lin Xuee committed an invading foul, and Chen [illegible] missed the free throw. Fujian's Huang Rulan committed a foul, and Philippine National's Yang Xiuzhi made the free throw. Fujian's Xu Xinxi scored a point, and Philippine National's Chen Yujian returned two points, making it 9-8, with the Philippine Nationals taking the lead. Philippine National's Xue Shuqiong committed a foul, and the time for the first quarter was up, and the referee announced that the free throw would be made up in the second quarter.</p>
<p>The battle restarted, and Fujian's Chen Jucai made the free throw, tying the score at 9-9. Philippine National's Liu Peizhen fouled again, and Fujian's Xu Xinxi scored one point from the free throw. The audience was worried about the Philippine Nationals, cheering them on. Philippine National's Chen Yurun responded with a shot, and Huang Rulan added another point, and the Philippine Nationals regained the lead. Since then, both sides scored with free throws, and at the end of the first half, the score was 16-11, with the Philippine Nationals taking the lead.</p>
<p>The second half began, and Fujian began to counterattack, making it 19-16, with the Philippine Nationals still in the lead in the third quarter. In the fourth quarter, Fujian's Xu Xinxi jumped under the basket and shot the ball into the net. Philippine National's Chen Yurun responded with two points. However, Ye Yijing and Chen Yurun committed consecutive fouls, and Xu Xinxi made all three free throws, tying the score at 21-21. The audience cheered for both sides for three minutes. At this time, the Philippine Nationals became nervous, and their shots missed, while Fujian made one of three free throws, and then reversed the situation with a score of 28-21, and Fujian turned defeat into victory. In this game, the Philippine Nationals were in the lead for all three quarters, and the audience expected them to win. The loss in the last quarter was probably due to underestimating the opponent.</p>
<p>Fujian Team Fouls and Scores</p>
<p>Chen Jucai: 0 fouls, 9 points</p>
<p>Xu Xinxi: 0 fouls, 17 points</p>
<p>Lin Zhihui: 0 fouls, 2 points</p>
<p>Chen Lixiang: 1 foul, 0 points</p>

<p>Total: 15 fouls, 21 points</p>
<p>Indonesia's Recovery Fails</p>
<p>In the Shanghai vs. Indonesia match, Shanghai's offensive line was extremely sharp, and Shi Zongmin and Huang Mingyuan broke into the basket as if entering an uninhabited area, calmly shooting and scoring repeatedly. Indonesia seemed unaccustomed to floor combat, and three players even entered the arena barefoot. What Indonesia relied on was originally agile movements and accurate shooting. With the movements restricted by the venue, they wanted to be fast but failed, and Shanghai's Zong Lan scored first, and Mingyuan repeatedly scored, and Indonesia trailed 0-11, and the forward's mentality was greatly affected. In a panic, they made long-range shots that were ineffective, and Huang Ruiliang replaced Li Xiuli, who scored one point as soon as she came on stage, breaking the egg record in the first quarter, and Indonesia trailed 13-2. The second quarter was 23-9, and Indonesia still showed no improvement. In the third quarter, Indonesia's shooting gradually got on track, and Gui Xin, Yu Ying, and Ruiliang each scored a point, and Mingyuan also showed her skills, and Li Xiuli re-entered the arena, and Ruiliang left the field, and Xiuli used her figure to wait under the basket to seize the ball, and scored in the gap, and at the end of the third quarter, they chased to 31-20. In the last quarter, Gui Xin scored two points first, making it 31-24, and the score gradually approached, and the audience applauded and cheered. Mingyuan made a free throw, and Yu Ying scored a point, making it 32-26, and Indonesia was only three goals behind. Shanghai's forwards stepped up the pressure, making it 40-29, and Mingyuan and Xiuli committed double fouls, Mingyuan made the free throw but Xiuli missed, Wang Shan committed her fourth invading foul and was penalized to leave the field, and Wang Wuli replaced her, and Xiuli made a free throw, winning three points in a row. Unfortunately, the time had arrived, and Indonesia ultimately lost with a score of 41-32 due to the loss of form in the first half, unable to catch up.</p>

<p>The Combined Services Team Seems Like a Whirlwind</p>
<p>[Our Report] The Shanghai vs. Indonesia Women's Basketball Championship game was held at the Grand Venue Gymnasium in the evening. The Indonesian team wore red clothes and red pants, and some people called them "Red Boys."</p>
<p>Before the game, the Indonesian captain presented the Shanghai team with a green triangular pennant, and the Shanghai captain Huang Mingyuan accepted it personally. Both sides were courteous.</p>
<p>Indonesian team members Chen Lanying, Li Xingniang, and Chen Jinsong all played barefoot.</p>
<p>Although the Indonesian team lost, they still retreated with three cheers.</p>
<p>In the Shanghai vs. Combined Services men's basketball game, Shanghai won by one goal, and the Combined Services lost with honor.</p>
<p>The Shanghai team dribbled slowly, and the Combined Services team dribbled quickly. One was "lukewarm water," and the other was a "whirlwind." One was as quiet as a virgin, and the other was as agile as a fleeing rabbit.</p>
<p>The Shanghai team's skills were better, but their stamina was not enough, and there were many flaws in the second half. Bao Songyuan collided with a Combined Services player once and happened to hurt his lower body, which was very embarrassing. After the game, the audience clamored to question the referee, but fortunately the military police were deployed tightly, and nothing happened.</p>
<p>The audience's emotions seemed to sympathize with the visiting team. Some people said, "Because the tournament is held in Shanghai, the tournament must not make Shanghai lose all popular support." (Wen Zhong)</p>
<h3 id="e110">Random Thoughts by the Track and Field: The Elusive Wang Shugui, Making Reporters Run in Circles <a href="#e110" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c110" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">110</a></h3>
<p>[Our Report] Whenever Taiwanese athletes appear, the routine is always warm-up exercises, every day without interruption, which always gives a good impression.</p>
<p>In the women's 60-meter final, Taiwanese athlete Guo Meili came in fifth and almost cried, saying that "the start was too slow." Male athletes repeatedly patted her on the shoulder to comfort her.</p>
<p>Pamphlets were all over the track. Although they were distributed early, they did not have an impact, but athletes still considered them a visual obstruction.</p>
<p>Beijing's female all-around champion Xian Shaomei did not run before throwing the javelin, but stood still and swayed a few times before throwing it, and the results were very poor.</p>
<p>Taiwanese female athlete Zhang Ruiyan's javelin had good momentum and sufficient strength. Every time the javelin landed, the Taiwanese athletes in the stands applauded for a while. As a result, she won the championship, and she smiled so much that her mouth could not close when she received the award.</p>
<p>At each event, there are always two white-clad angels standing by, their clothes ironed straight and snow-white dazzling, making them easy to spot.</p>
<p>In the men's 200-meter final, the top three were all Taiwanese. The team leader took their hands and jumped and cheered in the field.</p>
<p>Qingdao's female athlete Wang Shugui, number 45, won the 60-meter race and then won the championship in the fourth leg of the 400-meter relay. After running to the finish line both times, she suddenly disappeared. She was elusive, making many photographers "run in circles."</p>
<p>Seven or eight out of ten people who came to the venue today were watching Lou Wen'ao's 10,000-meter race. At exactly 3:41, the gun sounded and the competition began. The audience around was entranced, and the applause filled their ears.</p>
<p>The deaf-mutes Lou Xisan and Gu Guanyuan came to "cheer silently," holding four paper flags with the words "Overwhelm the Heroes" and "Break the National Record" written on them, raising their thumbs and just yelling.</p>
<p>Before Lou Wen'ao started, he drank enough distilled water. The people who came with him gestured and talked to him a lot.</p>
<p>When the Xinjiang 10,000-meter athlete drew lots, he could not understand the referee's number report and drew the wrong lot several times. Later, he simply stood with his back to the referee and let the referee see the number himself.</p>
<p>Air Force's Yu Xiwei ran the 100-meter race and then ran the 10,000-meter race. Everyone said they were worried that he would fail.</p>
<p>Lou Wen'ao wore a yellow vest and white shorts. Within twenty laps, he led every lap. Every time he passed a place, there was a lot of noise, but unfortunately he could not enjoy this enthusiasm.</p>
<p>The two Xinjiang athletes, Yahafu and Amudula, were five laps behind Lou Wen'ao, but they still ran the last three or four places. Their spirit was commendable, and the entire audience gave them warm applause.</p>
<p>Hong Kong's Zhu Fuxing wore a bright red vest and shorts for the pole vault. When he climbed to the top of the pole, he was eye-catching because of the bright colors, and the audience cheered continuously, but unfortunately he failed in the end and was not on the list.</p>
<p>In the 1,600-meter relay race, many spectators said, "Taiwan's Chen Yinglang is running the fourth leg, so what else is there to say?"</p>
<p>At the 200-meter final, the starter said to the athletes, "Today I am using a very big gun, very loud!" (Yuchang)</p>

<p>The All-China Games Ticketing Office issued an announcement stating that because the number of seats in the swimming pool is limited, it will not be possible to accommodate all athletes if they visit at the same time. Therefore, it is stipulated that visits will be arranged on different days for observation. Each team leader should collect the observation tickets from the Ticketing Office on the morning of the scheduled date. The number of tickets is based on the All-China Games' roster.</p>

<h3 id="e112">Three Groups, Northeast, North China, Taiwan, Appeal for the Dalian Football Team Incident and Provide Three Suggestions to the All-China Games Authorities <a href="#e112" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c112" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">112</a></h3>
<p>[Our Report] The northeast athletes' group leader, Liu Huakun, and the Tianjin athletes' group leader, Zhao Yaofu, representing the northeast, north China, and Taiwan groups, met with reporters yesterday afternoon at 4:00 PM to discuss the All-China Games' handling of the incident in which Dalian football players beat the referee. They believed that the handling method decided by the tournament's judicial committee was excessive and unfair, and in order to resolve this incident satisfactorily, they hoped that it would be reconsidered and a reasonable handling method adopted.</p>
<p>Northeast's team leader Liu Huakun first reported that it was not easy for the northeast to send representatives to participate in the All-China Games under the current difficult circumstances. The northeast athletes have been under enemy and puppet rule for a long time, and the main significance of their participation this time is to let them see the situation in the country and increase the cohesion of the northeast people. The unfortunate incident that occurred a few days ago, the impolite behavior of the Dalian players should be punished, but it is unreasonable for the tournament to punish the entire Dalian team so severely and even cancel their eligibility to participate in the next All-China Games because of the excessive actions of one or two players. The Dalian team has not yet received a notice from the tournament and hopes that it will not be implemented, otherwise the northeast delegation will not accept it.</p>
<p>Tianjin's team leader Zhao Yaofu said that the meaning of the National Games is first to promote sports and second to connect the feelings of various places. Young people inevitably take excessive actions due to temporary emotional impulses. The tournament's handling of such incidents should be based on the principle of educational guidance, so that the transgressors know how to correct their mistakes and resolve the matter satisfactorily. However, this time, the Dalian players were first sent to the police station and then planned to be prosecuted in court. This method is not the attitude that the tournament should have. As for canceling Dalian's eligibility and notifying the Shenyang Municipal Government to hold the Dalian football instructor accountable, it is even more inappropriate. The North China and Taiwan delegations witnessed this situation and, in order to break the deadlock, now put forward several opinions, hoping that the tournament will adopt them: (1) Maintain the dignity of the tournament and the referees, (2) Deal with this matter in an educational spirit, turning big things into small things and small things into nothing, and not engage in legal proceedings. (3) Give the northeast delegation the opportunity to review and deal with the offending players themselves. The punishment of the Dalian players will be the responsibility of the northeast delegation leader Liu Huakun. The above-mentioned points were to be contributed to the secretary-general Hao Gengsheng and the chief referee Zhang Boling by the three groups so that they can be reasonably resolved and avoid the recurrence of future unfortunate incidents. Zhang Tieshan, the leader of the Yunnan Women's Basketball Team, also stood up and spoke in his private capacity at the reception, believing that: (1) There have been three beating incidents in the tournament, and Dalian should not be punished so severely alone. (2) The northeast has been occupied by Japan for fourteen years, and emotionally, the northeast representatives should be given special treatment and should never be given special punishment in return.</p>
<p>Finally, the reporter asked what attitude would be adopted if the negotiation failed. Zhao Yaofu replied that we are not formally protesting, but only providing opinions, hoping that the tournament will accept them. If the tournament does not accept them, the North China and Taiwan delegations will have nothing to do with it. What the northeast will do will depend on how the situation develops. In short, as children of the Republic of China, we hope that this matter can be resolved reasonably.</p>
<h3 id="e113">Swimming Competition Admission Tickets: 400,000 Each <a href="#e113" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c113" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">113</a></h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] The National Games swimming competition is scheduled to officially commence today at 10:00 AM. To limit the number of spectators, the organizing committee resolved yesterday to issue a maximum of 4,000 admission tickets daily, priced at 400,000 each. Besides the ticket booths at the venue only selling tickets for the current day, advance sales will also be available at the Post Office Savings Bank on Jiujiang Road, the Shanghai Municipal Bank, and the Bank of Communications on Hankou Road.</p>
<p>It is anticipated that the swimming competition will draw an unprecedented crowd. As a precautionary measure, the organizing committee's engineering committee has decided to densely arrange thick wooden posts within the railings of the grandstand, creating a double line of defense to prevent a recurrence of the railing collapse. Concurrently, the organizing committee has also decided to strengthen security measures with full force, and no one will be allowed to enter the venue without a ticket. According to the person in charge of the police technical team yesterday, the team had already prepared in advance and decided to deploy a large number of police officers to surround the swimming pool, claiming, "We guarantee that not even a fly can get in."</p>
<p>Do Not Drop Leaflets Over the Pool</p>
<p>The National Games Organizing Committee issued a notice on the 11th, requesting relevant authorities who have been scattering leaflets from airplanes to refrain from doing so over the swimming pool, lest the leaflets fall into the water, clog the pipes, and impede cleaning, affecting the competition. Swimming competition today</p>
<p>Four Days of Revenue: 1.6 Billion</p>
<p>The swimming competition will last for four consecutive days starting today, with 4,000 tickets sold each day at 400,000 each, which means that the daily ticket revenue of the swimming pool could reach 1.6 billion. Chen Zhang'e mentioned: Three of the five Philippine swimming representatives have caught a cold from swimming practice and are feeling unwell, but they will still give it their all in the events they have entered, despite their illness.</p>

<h3 id="e115">Men's Volleyball Championship: Hong Kong Wins Over Guangzhou, Why Must Brothers Fight Each Other So Fiercely! <a href="#e115" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c115" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">115</a></h3>
<p>Equal in Strength, A Cataclysmic Battle, The Audience Shouts: "Hong Kong is Great!"</p>
<p>[Our Dispatch] The men's volleyball round-robin championship was held yesterday at the Municipal Gymnasium. The Guangzhou team, generally considered a contender for the championship, was defeated by Hong Kong with a score of three to one. Another match, Shanghai vs. Police, originally scheduled for yesterday afternoon, was temporarily postponed.</p>
<p>The Guangzhou-Hong Kong match was essentially a battle of Cantonese volleyball talents. The two teams were evenly matched in skill, and the intensity of the fight and the ferocity of the battle were unprecedented, making it the most astonishing scene since the start of the volleyball competition.</p>
<p>The lineups of the two teams are as follows:</p>
<p>In the first and second games, the Hong Kong team employed clever strategic attacks, such as the middle blocker in the front row jumping up as if to spike, but in an instant, a killer from the second row would fly out and quickly slam a shot into the opponent's open space. At the same time, the three players in the front row locked the net extremely well, causing the Guangzhou team's continuous fierce attacks to repeatedly fail. As a result, Hong Kong won the first and second games easily, with scores of 21-11 and 21-13.</p>
<p>By the third game, the Guangzhou team finally recognized the Hong Kong team's tactics and saw through their strategy, launching a courageous counterattack. The fierce battle reached its climax. When the score reached 13-14, neither side would give an inch, returning spike for spike and kill for kill. Chen Yingkuan of the Guangzhou team and Zhong Shiyuan of the Hong Kong team both repeatedly dived to save the ball, fighting for every inch of ground. The ball was spiked back and forth for nearly a minute, and the audience was ecstatic. It was truly incredibly exciting! But at this time, the Hong Kong team felt the pressure from Li Lianze, Zhao Lianwu, etc., and lost to the Guangzhou team with a score of 16-21. In the fourth round, Guangzhou pressed forward step by step, and the Hong Kong team felt slightly overwhelmed. Their net locking was not as tight as in the first two games, and Guangzhou won against Hong Kong again with a score of 21-10.</p>
<p>The fifth game began, and both teams were determined to win, resulting in multiple ties. However, the Hong Kong team was calm and composed, unlike the Guangzhou team, which was prone to panic (especially the middle blocker in the third row, whose constant shouting sapped the team's morale), and ultimately narrowly won the fifth game with a score of 21-18, securing the victory.</p>
<p>During the middle of yesterday's match, the competition was once nearly suspended due to Guangzhou's repeated disputes with the referees, which caused a conflict. Fortunately, the Hong Kong team's coach had excellent sportsmanship, restrained his players, and was happy to accept the referees' opinions without hesitation. The audience shouted, "Hong Kong is great! Hong Kong's sportsmanship is great!"</p>
<p>Police vs. Shanghai Clash This Morning</p>
<p>The men's volleyball round-robin match between the Police and Shanghai, originally scheduled for yesterday afternoon, was temporarily postponed. The organizing committee has now decided to reschedule it for 10:00 AM today. In addition, the men's volleyball repechage match, Zhejiang vs. Xinjiang, will start at 9:00 AM this morning, and Jilin vs. Hunan will start at 10:00 AM. Both will be held at the volleyball court in the Municipal Stadium.</p>
<h3 id="e116">On the Volleyball Court: Kill! Kill! Kill! <a href="#e116" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c116" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">116</a></h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] For the women's volleyball championship match between Shanghai and Hunan, the stands of the Municipal Gymnasium were filled with Hunan natives, especially soldiers.</p>
<p>When the match began, the Shanghai cheering squad took the lead, but the Hunan soldiers refused to be outdone, shouting bugle calls. All that could be heard was, "Kill! Kill! Kill!" - a continuous stream of shouts of "Kill!"</p>
<p>After Shanghai won the first set, the emotions in the stands became increasingly tense. Many people believed that the refereeing was unfair and shouted with raised arms, "Damn it, fight!" Seeing that the situation was not good, the Shanghai cheering squad quickly lowered their flags and retreated.</p>
<p>Many unrelated spectators were mixed in the middle, subconsciously shouting loudly, stimulating the atmosphere of the venue, which was really undesirable.</p>
<p>The next match was the Fangzi volleyball match between Hong Kong and Guangzhou. Although they were both from the same province of Guangdong, the emotions were also quite tense. Both sides questioned the referee several times. Someone said, "It's really not easy to be a referee for the organizing committee."</p>
<p>Guangzhou initially lost two sets in a row, and only managed to pull one back in the third set. A member of the Guangzhou cheering squad said, "It's really dangerous. If we get a duck egg [shutout], how will we have the face to go back to Shamian?"</p>
<p>The Zhejiang women's volleyball team has suffered repeated defeats. Because the team members are all female students from Zhejiang University and the final exams are approaching, the team leader Shen Fangxia applied to the organizing committee for permission to withdraw from the repechage match. The entire team is scheduled to leave Shanghai and return to Hangzhou today. (Zhong Yu)</p>

<h3 id="e117">Good Things Take Time, Women's Volleyball Round Robin, Unnecessary Complications Arise, Cheering Squads Exuberantly Shout "Fight, Fight, Fight," The Match Cannot Be Completed and Has to Be Stopped, Stopped, Stopped <a href="#e117" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c117" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">117</a></h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] The women's volleyball round-robin finals for the four seeded teams began on the 9th. The Shanghai team, which is highly touted to win the championship, has already defeated Taiwan first, and the Hunan women's army, which has high hopes for second place, has also defeated Guangzhou by a large margin. The two teams met yesterday morning at the Municipal Gymnasium. Both sides had cheering squads, with Hunan having two squads, totaling about a hundred people.</p>
<p>Shanghai-Hunan Scoring Issue to be Discussed and Resolved Today</p>
<p>After Shanghai won the first game with a score of 21-4, the Hunan cheering squad believed that the referee Zhong Zhiqiang had made a mistake in the refereeing and repeatedly shouted "Fight," creating a tense situation. Soon, the Shanghai cheering squad accepted the advice of a third party and stopped cheering.</p>
<p>When the third game was in progress, the atmosphere of the court was abnormal, and the audience felt that it was a great damper. The Shanghai players also performed abnormally, and the Hunan team won with a score of 21-17.</p>
<p>The third game began, and both sides were determined to win. After fighting to a tie at 16, Shanghai scored, and the score was 17-16. The Hunan cheering squad believed that the Shanghai team had hit the ball four times in a row, which was a foul, and shouted "Fight" again, preparing to rush into the court. Fortunately, the barbed wire fence blocked them, and a large number of police officers arrived to maintain order, preventing an accident. However, the Hunan cheering squad insisted that the 17th point earned by the Shanghai team should be invalidated, while the Shanghai team held the opposite view and was unwilling to sacrifice the 17th point. As a result, the match was suspended, and the issue of the 17th point was handed over to the organizing committee for resolution. The organizing committee has scheduled a forum to be held today to discuss and resolve it.</p>
<p>The lineups of the Shanghai and Hunan teams are attached below:</p>
<p>Taiwan Defeats Guangzhou by a Large Margin, Presenting a One-Sided Situation</p>
<p>In the afternoon, Taiwan met Guangzhou, and the situation became one-sided. The Taiwan team won 2-0. The lineups of the two teams are as follows:</p>
<p>The front, middle, and back rows of the Guangzhou team were all very weak. They were mostly afraid to pounce and save the "attack balls" served by the Taiwan team, while the Taiwan team's one kill and one slam in the front row on the left and the second row on the right often left the Guangzhou team with no way to parry. Therefore, in the first and second games, the two teams lost with a difference of 10-21.</p>
<p>The Taiwan team's performance yesterday was much more advanced than before. Although they were shorter in stature, they did not suffer because of it. What was particularly commendable was the spirit of the Taiwanese ladies in obeying the referee and their sportsmanship. After each match, regardless of winning or losing, the entire Taiwan team would gather in front of the net, salute and shake hands with each team member of the opposing team, indicating that ball skills and feelings were two different things.</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 11th] The 14th World Games are scheduled to be held in London in July, and our country has decided to send representatives to participate.

<h3 id="e119">Shanghai Women's Volleyball Dispute, The Organizing Committee Accepts Protest Letters <a href="#e119" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c119" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">119</a></h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] Regarding the dispute in the round-robin match between the Shanghai and Hunan women's volleyball teams, both teams have formally submitted protests to the organizing committee, and their protest letters have been submitted to the documentation group of the organizing committee. The adjudication committee convened an emergency meeting yesterday afternoon for this purpose.</p>
<p>It is reported that the organizing committee has accepted the protest letters from both teams and has scheduled another meeting of the adjudication committee to be held at 10:00 AM today, presided over by Wang Zhengting himself, to seek a reasonable solution as quickly as possible and not to delay. The organizing committee stated that this precedent should not be set, otherwise future matches will not be able to continue. The solution will be based on fairness as the principle, and the final decision can be made today.</p>
<p>It is also learned that the main content of the Hunan team's protest letter is that the order of events stated that volleyball should be held outdoors, but the result was changed to indoors, which is unfair, and they request that the venue be changed back to outdoors. On the Shanghai side, it was stated that the actions of some of the Hunan cheering squad's spectators were clearly in violation of the rules of sports and affected the results. They asked the organizing committee to uphold justice and demanded that the 17 points already obtained must be recognized.</p>
<h3 id="e120">Table Tennis Competition with a Variety of Styles, Women's Finale Brings Unexpected Upsets, Yang Weibin Overwhelms Liu Yunu, Liang Yujie Defeats Sun Meiying <a href="#e120" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c120" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">120</a></h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] The four men's and women's table tennis round-robin matches held at the Assembly Hall Gymnasium yesterday morning were extremely intense. In the women's division, unexpected upsets occurred. Yang Weibin from Guangzhou unexpectedly defeated Liu Yunu from Taiwan, and Sun Meiying from Shanghai lost to Liang Yujie from Hong Kong. In the men's division, Xue Xuchu from Shanghai easily defeated You Ruheng from Malaysia, and Wang Youxin from Taiwan narrowly defeated Zhong Zhancheng from Hong Kong. In addition, there were eight repechage matches, five of which were forfeited, so only three repechage matches remained, serving as the finale of yesterday's table tennis competition.</p>
<p>At 9:00 AM sharp, Liang Yujie (Hong Kong) and Sun Meiying (Shanghai) were the first to take the stage, winning the first game with a score of 12-10. Liang then won the second game with a difference of 11-4. In the third game, Sun took the offensive and powerfully drew against Liang, ultimately losing the third game with a score of 7-11. After that, Liang played steadily, calmly responding to the challenge, and won two consecutive games with scores of 11-9 and 11-7. She narrowly defeated Sun Meiying from Shanghai 3-2.</p>
<p>Sighing and Moaning, Quite Entertaining</p>
<p>In the second act, Wang Youxin (Taiwan) encountered Zhong Zhancheng (Hong Kong). The first game was extremely exciting. Whenever either of them made a mistake, they would either sigh to the sky or pat their thighs and moan. Zhong Zhancheng won the first game first with a score of 15-13. Wang Youxin was extremely angry and stomped his feet, breaking a ball, because Zhong had luckily won a point (the ball touched the corner of the table). In the second game, Wang tied the score with 11-4. In the third game, Zhong won another game with 11-9. At this time, the audience cheered Wang Youxin on, and Wang then used all his skills, winning twice with scores of 11-4 and 11-8. As a result, Zhong was defeated 3-2.</p>
<p>In the match between Xue Xuchu (Shanghai) and You Ruheng (Malaysia), You Ruheng lowered his head with a score of 3-1. (Scores were 11-9, 11-6, 8-11, 11-8.)</p>
<p>Husband Helps in Battle, Wife Gains Courage</p>
<p>In the finale, Liu Yunu from Taiwan played against Yang Weibin from Guangzhou. Yang's husband, the famous tennis player Ye Guanxiong, also watched from the sidelines, cheering for Yang. After Liu and Yang made contact, Liu immediately gained the upper hand, winning the first game with 11-5. In the second game, Liu's actions were scattered, while Yang maintained a serious style, with no smile on her face, winning with 11-9. Unexpectedly, Liu Yunu was unwilling to fight, while Yang Weibin became more and more courageous, winning all consecutive battles. She won the third game with a score of 11-4. In the final game, although Liu Yunu tried her best to fight like a trapped beast, the overall situation was over, and she was unable to recover, losing to Yang Weibin with a score of 1-3, which was unexpected.</p>

<h3 id="e122">Men's Softball Round-Robin Finals to be Held Today at Yiyuan, Taiwan and Guangzhou Teams are Formidable, Among the Eliminated Teams, Fujian is Full of Talent <a href="#e122" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c122" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">122</a></h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] The final four teams in the Men's Softball Championship have been determined, and the round-robin finals are scheduled to begin today. The first match, Taiwan vs. Police, will be held at Yiyuan at 9:00 AM. The Police team is represented by the Taiwan Athletes team. Their defense in both the infield and outfield is excellent, but the pitcher's soft throws are inevitably exploited by the enemy. Therefore, it will be difficult to win today's battle against Taiwan, which is the most highly touted team.</p>
<p>In the second match, Shanghai will play against Guangdong. The Shanghai players are all from "Panda," and their defense is excellent, but their hitting is not ideal. On the Guangdong side, the elites from Hong Kong and Guangzhou are melted into one, and their strength is naturally strong. In this battle between tigers and dragons, it is unknown who will win.</p>
<p>In the men's repechage match, Fujian vs. Zhejiang, the former has many good players. Last time, they only lost to the Police by one point. Today, taking Zhejiang should be easy.</p>
<p>In the women's softball match, Shanghai will also play against Guangdong. The Shanghai team is composed of the elite from Yue Da, Maria, and Zhongxi schools, and they are all students of Liang Fuchu, inheriting a consistent style, with close coordination and tacit understanding, which is naturally superior. On the Guangdong side, in addition to the pitcher Ma Lianxiu being particularly strong, there are no other notable features. Today's victory or defeat will depend on whether the Shanghai hitters can escape the danger of Ma Lianxiu's three throws.</p>
<p>In another match, Nanjing vs. Gansu, the strength of these two dark horses is impossible to predict. Whether the two teams can compete with Shanghai and Guangdong will only be known after the battle. (Xin)</p>
<h3 id="e123">Predictions of Rankings in Men's and Women's Volleyball <a href="#e123" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c123" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">123</a></h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent Liang You Ting</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper] After watching several days of intense volleyball competitions, the general public now has a rough idea of the potential rankings for the men's and women's teams. Specifically: the men's championship is most likely to go to Hong Kong or Guangzhou, with Hong Kong having the best chance; the police team and Shanghai are likely to contend for third and fourth place, with the police team appearing stronger than Shanghai.</p>
<p>Originally, the Guangzhou men's volleyball team was considered a strong contender for the championship. However, veteran players Li Fushen (middle of the third row) and Qiu Guangxie (left of the second row) were unable to participate, leading to a 2-3 loss to Hong Kong in yesterday's round-robin matches. At the same time, the strength displayed by Hong Kong in yesterday's match, with its free-flowing offense and defense, has led the audience to re-evaluate Hong Kong and consider them as having a very high chance of taking first place.</p>
<p>Seven Advantages of the Hong Kong Team</p>
<p>In the reporter's opinion, the Guangzhou, Hong Kong, and Police teams all have their strengths and weaknesses. Whether the Hong Kong team can secure the championship depends on luck. However, the Hong Kong team has undeniable advantages: (1) Their blocking technique is top-notch, the best among all the strong teams. Therefore, they don't seem seriously threatened by teams that are good at offensive plays like the Guangzhou and Police teams; (2) They are quite skilled in using tactics to cover their offensive direction, making it difficult for the opponent to predict the ball's trajectory; (4) Approximately five or six players are good at serving attacking balls, making the team's overall strength very balanced; (5) Yu Qien on the left of the second row is a reliable killer, with a good grasp of how to quickly spike the ball; (6) Zhong Shiyuan, the center of the third row, is an outstanding talent in the third row, with unique skills in diving to save the ball and assisting spikes. He is by no means inferior to any of the center players in the other three strong teams; (7) The Hong Kong team members are all seasoned veterans, good at calmly responding to challenges and playing a steady game.</p>
<p>Based on the above reasons, the Hong Kong team should logically not miss out on the championship. However, the Hong Kong team's only weakness is that their offense is less developed than their defense. If they suffer a loss, it will likely be due to this.</p>
<p>Police Team Full of Vitality</p>
<p>Next, let's talk about the Police team: this team is full of vitality, based on the Guangdong Taishan Middle School team. They have won the Guangdong Provincial Games championship, but their biggest weaknesses are lack of experience and poor blocking skills. Their offense lacks deceptive strategies, which is exactly the opposite of the Hong Kong team. From this reporter's perspective, the Police volleyball team is no match for the Hong Kong team.</p>
<p>Guangzhou is Also Strong</p>
<p>As for the current lineup of the Guangzhou team, the most capable players are likely the front-row player Li Lianze, the back-row player Chen Yingkuan, and Zhao Lianwu in the second row. In reality, their strength is comparable to that of Hong Kong, but their blocking is not as strong as the Hong Kong team. They are not as composed as the Hong Kong team during tense moments and tend to panic when making mistakes. Therefore, they lost to Hong Kong this time. However, if the Guangzhou team encounters the Police and Shanghai teams, the outcome will be different.</p>
<p>Shanghai Team Has Difficulty Against Southern Teams</p>
<p>Finally, let's talk about the Shanghai men's volleyball team: everyone knows that their strength is far less than that of the Shanghai team in the previous National Games. Moreover, before the National Games, "Hua Yan" lost a friendly match against the Hong Kong team, which further demonstrates that Shanghai's volleyball is difficult to compete with Southern teams. This time, the Shanghai team is facing three Guangdong teams (Guangzhou, Hong Kong, and Police), so their future is not optimistic. However, the Shanghai team also has strong players like Huang Yaohua (center of the third row), Wei Dingyi (center of the second row), Weng Chengguang, and Zheng Yiquan. If they can coordinate well, they won't be completely defeated. However, Zheng Yiquan's and Weng Chengguang's offensive plays may be blocked by the opponents, especially when the Shanghai team encounters the Hong Kong and Guangzhou teams.</p>
<p>The Overall Women's Volleyball Situation is Set</p>
<p>Regarding the situation in women's volleyball, there is actually no need to elaborate much, because three round-robin matches have already been played. The issue lies in the temporary changes that occurred during the Shanghai-Hunan match and how the organizing committee will handle it. However, regardless of the outcome, in terms of skills, the Shanghai team seems to be in the lead for the championship. Yesterday, the Shanghai team's 21-4 victory in the first round against the Hunan team is clear evidence of this.</p>
<p>Among the four seeded teams, the Guangzhou team is the worst. No matter how the top three are arranged, it is undisputed that the Guangzhou team will be in last place.</p>
<p>Therefore, we can reach a conclusion: Shanghai and Hunan are the most likely contenders for the women's volleyball championship, with Shanghai being even more likely. The Taiwan team also has a chance for second place, but they may also be in third place, while Guangzhou will be in fourth place.</p>

He has now recovered, safely returned to the team, and resumed his work. This is disclosed to inform those who care about Mr. Yang.</p>

<h3 id="e129">New Methods and Principles for Import Settlement and Exchange - The Import Management Committee Decides to Maintain the Original Proposal - Technical Supplements May Be Added to the Implementation <a href="#e129" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c129" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">129</a></h3>
<p>Although the new methods for import settlement and exchange have been communicated through a circular from the Central Bank, the import industry and industrial associations believe that there are difficulties in implementing them, and have requested that the order be withdrawn. It is reported that the Central Bank and the Import Management Committee have decided to maintain the original proposal and thoroughly implement it. However, technical supplements may be added to the implementation.</p>
<p>In addition, regarding the guarantee order, the designated bank association has increased from 50% to 100%, with 50% paid in cash and another 50% paid in national treasury bonds. According to the person in charge of the designated bank association, if importers only pay 50%, the responsibility of the designated bank is too great, so it is necessary to collect 100%. Importers can also earn interest on the 50% of national treasury bonds, so there is no loss to the original settler.</p>
<h3 id="e130">Industrial Associations Decide Through Discussion that the New Law Should Be Passed by the Legislative Yuan <a href="#e130" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c130" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">130</a></h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, This City] In order to discuss the new import settlement and exchange methods recently announced by the Import Management Committee, the sixfold advance payment of the 36th year profit tax, and the issue that same-day checks cannot be cashed, the industrial associations of this city held a discussion meeting at the Xing Wu Restaurant at 3:00 p.m. yesterday.

(2) Before the Legislative Yuan discusses the case, the Import Management Committee should handle everything in accordance with the old methods. (3) Settlement and exchange for raw materials imported under the fourth-quarter quota should be cleared with the factories within a specified time limit. (4) The Supervisory Yuan should be requested to investigate and announce the use of all non-quota foreign exchange in the past. (5) Wu Yun Chu, Jin Run Xiang, Tian He Qing, Yang Li Ren, Hong Nian Zu, Jing Shu Ping, Pan Shi Hao, Dong Shu Ying, Zhang Shan Bu, and Hu Junmei, the representative of the Zhejiang Industrial Association, were elected as representatives to visit the Import Management Committee and the Central Bank authorities this morning (the 12th) to present the above matters in person.

The result was similar to the previous day's price. 120-count Asahi brand bright rayon opened high in the morning at 445 million yuan, with a maximum transaction of 61 million yuan. The afternoon close retreated to 55 million yuan for the next-day price.

<p>Due to the rapid rise in woolen fabrics, buyers restrained themselves, and the actual sales of shops all fell sharply. The rapid rise in spot prices caused confusion both inside and outside the industry. The path of Western-style clothing materials for local merchants suddenly turned deserted. Yesterday, when inspecting woolen fabric and Western-style clothing merchants in various districts, a slightly decent Western-style suit required 35 to 36 million national currency, and a robe material required 20 million yuan.</p>

<p>Foreign stocks rose again yesterday, fueled by external forces. Securities dealers, remittance dealers, money exchangers, and merchants all participated. Yisha rose from 5.4 million in the morning to a new high of 5.68 million, and then declined before the close. The same trend was seen in other stocks. External stimulus also showed signs of loosening. The closing price retreated close to the morning opening line. The overall situation was volatile. Large investors were gathering stocks in Yisha and Guangyi. Due to positive environmental news, the former rose by 10% and the latter rose by a strong 5%. Union Insurance, Aviation, Shipping, and Rubber stocks rose by about 5%, while Jardine Matheson stock rose slightly. Paper stocks were the most disappointing, falling slightly.</p>

<p>Yesterday, Chinese stocks turned from bullish to weak, and the same was true for external stimulus. Yongsha first set a new high of 3275 yuan, and Xin Guang and Jingfu were price-limited and then sold at a discount. In the afternoon, due to external pressure, a reverse wind rose, and before the close.</p>

Handling fees opened high at 26 yuan and 30 yuan, and retreated to 3215 yuan. No. 149 and others strongly purchased, and foreign stocks and off-market materials became bullish again, rising to 3265 yuan. After Xin Guang and Jingfu were price-limited, there were no suppliers, and they continued to be sold at a discount. With the tightening of accounting checks, many parties had settlements, and then retreated into the 3200 yuan level. Soon after, they were advanced again to a new high of 3275 yuan. No. 69 and others sold short in groups, and floating shorts were settled in time. The price fell to a low of 3165 yuan near noon. The afternoon close was 3210 yuan. Except for Xin Guang and Jingfu Zhongxing reaching the price limit, Huaxin fell by half a percent, Rongfeng fell slightly, and Xinhua and Huafeng were flat, the rest all rose slightly or by no more than half a percent.</p>
<p>In the afternoon market, Yongsha was at 3210 yuan, and Xin Guang and Jingfu were still price-limited. Yongsha's sharpness gradually subsided. Although No. 35 and others advanced to 3240 yuan, rumors of police cracking down on the securities market made people nervous. The price initially fell to 3085 yuan. The Hong Kong telegram shrank, and peers arrived at 3160 yuan. Accounting checks became stricter, with a large number of accounts. Off-market accounts also loosened. Under the short selling, the price was forced down to a low of 3040 yuan, and the closing price was 3085 yuan. Compared with the morning close, Xinyi and Zhongsi were flat, Huaxin rose slightly, Xin Guang and Jingfu reached the price limit, and the rest all fell slightly or by no more than half a percent.

<p>Yesterday's rice market was stable and uneventful. The lack of price fluctuations in the Xishi market compared to the previous day turned the excited hearts to calm. Prices in the northern and southern markets were no different from the previous day. Northern market white japonica rice remained at 5.5 million, but white round rice rose by 200,000 alone due to scarcity. The southern market opened the cheapest in the morning, and the sales were quite active later. At the close, sellers intended to call for higher prices, but the market had already closed. Yesterday, 4,079 dan of rice arrived in the northern and southern markets.</p>
<p>Flour prices were firmly bullish. There were no transactions in the market due to price controls. The off-market price was seeing goods purchased under the strong absorption of northern merchants, and each flour had jumped out of the 2 million mark. Lao Shi and Bingchuan both closed at 2.1 million yuan, a sharp increase of 170,000 yuan compared to the previous day. Hongfeng and Jiancheng each reached 2.07 million yuan. Only a thousand bags of second-class flour were traded in the market. Wheat bran rose by 120,000, and wheat rose from 3 million to 3.1 million.</p>
<p>Miscellaneous grains continued to advance towards their peak. Arriving soybeans were scarce, and merchants sold less because the price in the producing area was high. The initial opening price was up more than 100,000, and the market rose again because both cakes and oil rose, for a total increase of 300,000. Green beans rose the most sharply, adding 800,000 yuan, and local merchants were all taking them. Gumi was scarce, red sorghum sales were active, and each increased by more than 100,000 yuan.

<h3 id="e141">Talks on Ju Lai's Seal Manual <a href="#e141" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c141" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">141</a></h3>
<p>— Zheng Yimei</p>
<p>I have often recited the verse of a wise man on seals: "The Xuanhe Seal Manual began with one word, Xiao Tang collected antiquities with great effort, later, our Zhao family followed one after another, but none could compare to Ye Jingshu's Shi Yun." It is said that seal manuals began in Yihe. Wang Qiu, also known as Ziben, of the Song Dynasty had the Xiao Tang Collection of Antiquities. Zhao Songxue of the Yuan Dynasty had the History of Seals. Ye Jingshu of Qiantang had the Annotated Illustrations of Han and Tang Seal Carvings; and this trend greatly flourished. In recent times, Zhao Shuru was regarded as a master of seal carving. Since Shuru's passing, Chen Julai has been consistently praised as surpassing his predecessor, having inherited his method. Julai has been engaged in seal carving for more than thirty years, and he is renowned at home and abroad for his Yuan Zhu style. However, he is known for his refined and scholarly spirit and does not keep drafts. Those at home and abroad who admire him have wanted to obtain his seal manual to gain a comprehensive understanding for years, eagerly anticipating it. Yang Pengzhi of Zhongshan, a man of refined taste with a passion for seals, commissioned Julai to carve sixty name seals (forty-one ivory and nineteen stone). Name seals have relatively few variations, but Julai's ingenuity is unique, fully utilizing his ability to create intricate arrangements. Some are half intaglio and half relief, some have three relief characters and one intaglio character, and some have three intaglio characters and one relief character, yet the composition is perfectly integrated. At first glance, the intaglio seems like relief, and the relief seems like intaglio, such is the wonder of it. Some are triangular in the east, some have no borders but have boundary lines in the middle, and some have earthworms and dragons echoing the relief and intaglio characters; those who do not know better might think they were invented, but in reality, each has a source and each has a standard. Looking at them is like seeing a beautiful woman wearing flowers or a court official in ceremonial robes, and the clarity of the bright moon and the expanse of the clouds cannot compare to even a fraction of their splendor. Yang acquired them and vowed to publish a seal manual, naming it Gezhai. Julai specially requested Zhang Ludang to make seal ink, as red as fire agate, bright and dazzling, for the purpose of rubbing the seals. Each seal is rubbed twice, once in red for the relief and once in black for the intaglio, with the side inscriptions rubbed separately afterward, the exquisite beauty of which is rarely seen. It is said that each set of the seal manual will consist of two volumes, to be distributed to libraries across the country, as well as to relatives and friends. A small portion will be given to the Xuanhe Seal Society for sale. Yang's ambition is not to seek profit, but simply to forge connections through calligraphy and painting and to make a contribution to the art world.</p>
<h3 id="e142">Using Humans as Sacrifices and the Efficacy of Aversion <a href="#e142" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c142" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">142</a></h3>
<p>— Kong Linggu</p>
<p>—Taking Atayal Mythology as an Example—</p>
<p>In the account of Ximen Bao's throwing shamans into the river, we learned about the story of the River God marrying a bride. The River God marrying a bride is a later interpretation; its original meaning was actually the sacrifice of young girls. The story of using humans as sacrifices is often seen in novels. Its origin lies in the idea of sacrificing one person to preserve the group. Its starting point is reasonable, but in Ximen Bao's account, it becomes both superstitious and vulgar.</p>
<p>Using humans as sacrifices has two meanings. The first is the one mentioned above, such as when there are fierce snakes and beasts in the mountains that often devour people. Sending a substitute to die can ensure the safety of a village. The second is related to the efficacy of aversion. An example of the efficacy of aversion can be seen in the legend of the Atayal people of Beishi.</p>
<p>According to the legend of the Atayal people of Beishi, in ancient times, there was a giant rock on Dabajian Mountain. One day, it naturally split open, and two people, a man and a woman, emerged. These were the ancestors of the Atayal people of Beishi. One day, out of curiosity, the two embraced each other, and a golden fly came and taught them about human relations. Thus, four children were born. As the children grew, they married each other, and their descendants multiplied, forming a clan.</p>
<p>At this time, a great flood broke out, increasing day and night, almost reaching the top of the mountain. The clan gathered to discuss, believing that they must have violated a taboo, causing the great god to become angry. They should find a way to appease him and apologize as soon as possible. First, they threw in a dog, but the water continued to rise. Then, they threw in an old man, but the water still increased without decreasing. The clan was terrified and did not know what to do. After a thorough investigation, they discovered that a brother and sister had engaged in secret relations. They threw the brother and sister into the sea, and the flood gradually receded. At that time, the brother was thrown into the Daan River, and the sister was thrown into the Beigang River. Now, there are towering peaks and deep valleys there, which were formed by the flood at that time.</p>
<p>This myth can illustrate that throwing people into the river contains the meaning of aversion. As for people being born from stone, it is a type of myth similar to Yu being born from the stone of Xin. In ancient times, Dayu should have been regarded as the ancestor of a clan.

<h3 id="e143">Zhimo's Diary <a href="#e143" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c143" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">143</a></h3>
<p>— Posthumous Works of Xu Zhimo, Compiled by Chen Congzhou</p>
<p>December 15th. Attended the Red Cross membership solicitation meeting at Mechanic Hall with Po Hongshou. Mrs. Clark delivered a speech on the tragic situation of Germany's invasion of Belgium, the tireless resistance of the Belgian people, and the hardships of the Red Cross. The lady was generous and righteous, moving everyone in the audience. Following her, there was a speech on the situation in Russia and Germany's strategies towards Russia, which was not very exciting. Finally, Mr. Stockton Axson, relative by marriage to President Wilson, secretary of the Red Cross, who had just returned from the battlefield, spoke about the achievements of the Red Cross and its future expansion plans, aiming to provide relief to the world's poor and destitute.</p>
<p>I had two thoughts at the evening's meeting. One was the shock at the foreign women's eagerness to take risks for justice, surpassing even men. Comparing this to our country, where ignorance and obstruction prevail, and the female academic community is mostly indulging in entertainment, showing off strange appearances and decorations to dazzle the world, and using the guise of freedom to indulge in wanton behavior, causing people to feel wary and fearful upon hearing the name of female students!</p>
<p>These people loudly proclaim women's rights, but in reality, they debase and harm themselves. Even if I wanted to respect and honor them, I cannot. Women have a role in the evolution and reform of society and the family. If things are like this, what more can be said! There are a few pioneers who encourage and guide, always with sincere hearts, but the ignorant and stubborn men then ridicule and suppress them. Today, the mention of women's rights is still in its infancy, and they are easily eradicated and wantonly trampled upon. Is this not tragic!</p>
<p>Speaking of the country, one must start with the community, and speaking of the community, one must start with the family. The family is formed by men and women. Therefore, to have the ambition to govern the world, one must also include women. Thus, Zhimo's great dream of managing China adds another major item. Alas! Where can I find a bright and courageous woman!</p>
<p>Another thought is that I have always known the preciousness of time! But I did not know how to cherish it. Looking back on the past, I cannot help but hate my mistakes. Today, I am still groping around, unable to open my own path. The languor of today will become the basis for future laments. Time is passing day by day. Is this not dangerous! My original intention was not only to seek knowledge from books, but also to open my ears and eyes to observe the power and authority of the world, and the essential principles of things, so that I could understand things by analogy and cultivate both my spirit and knowledge. Now, I am confined to the page, even though I have traveled thousands of miles, it is as if I have not gone anywhere. To go out blindly and return confused, one can know the outcome! Is this not dangerous!</p>
<p>It has been seven days since the vacation! Besides writing letters, I have only gathered with others to engage in meaningless small talk. The cold dew locks the empty space, the atmosphere is stagnant and dull, and ice and snow fill the streets, leaving nowhere to go. Even my usual thoughts are obstructed and inflexible. How tired I am! Dao An suggested going to New York, but I declined due to the expense. I think that rather than guarding myself in poverty, I should be bold and open. There are many talented and virtuous people in New York, and I should not miss the opportunity to meet them. Why hesitate to go?</p>
<p>The other day, Jiang Jun came. He used to be a major in the military and is now studying mathematics at Harvard. He is a serious and honest person, but I worry that after returning to China, he will not have a suitable opportunity to focus on his research and will ultimately be unable to compete with scholars around the world, which is a pity! Through Jiang, I learned that Tang Yulu, whom I met once three years ago, is also at Harvard. Yulu is handsome and refreshing, and I have always admired him. In the past, Yuan Longzi recognized him. Therefore, I quickly wrote a letter and sent it to him, describing our past acquaintance. Today, I received a flamboyant and colorful reply, full of warmth. I cannot help but let my spirit drift towards him. When we meet in the future, holding arms and reminiscing about old times will also be a joyful thing.</p>

<p>— Zhao Jingshen</p>
<p>British Pantomime</p>
<p>Every winter in Britain, there must be a pantomime performance. This entertainment starts from Christmas and lasts for one or two months, or even three months. Major theaters in major cities all perform this kind of play. There are no such examples elsewhere, so foreign guests often do not understand it. This is a mixture of fairy tales and music, including sentiment, "slapstick" (two flat wooden boards, one end fastened tightly, the other end loosened, used to indicate the heaviness of the strike when A hits B), dance, and vaudeville. Children like this because they are familiar with many of the jokes. They always feel that they are too old to watch pantomime. Adults also like it because it has childishness. There is no place that the adult mind can imagine. There are also songs in pantomime, which are sung by the performers, or we might call it gesture drama, which is more appropriate.</p>
<p>The current form of British pantomime has only been around for less than a hundred years. At first, it used rhyming poems, full of humor and fantasy. The characters on stage may be Prince Charming of the eighteenth century, wearing a wig and silk clothes. This tradition of poetic drama, recognized by the great talents of the Elizabethan era, has now degenerated into something found in vulgar theaters.</p>
<p>Wearing masks and clowning are what audiences find most interesting. People often imitate animals, wearing animal fur, or men dress as women, or women wear men's clothes. This can still be seen in modern British pantomime.</p>
<p>The protagonist of folk tales and popular legends is often a young woman, who has beautiful legs and a good voice suitable for singing. Therefore, Prince Charming often appears as a woman with beautiful legs, singing a solo in a high voice. She can even sing about recent politics. Conversely, old women are often played by comedic male actors.</p>
<p>Over the years, the songs and rhymes have changed, but the stories are always the same. "Cinderella," "Puss in Boots," and "Little Red Riding Hood" are always performed. Children especially like this. They perform it twice a day and for several weeks after Christmas. Children go to school to study, and adults continue to watch it. Arthur Askey is the most famous actor in pantomime.</p>
<p>The Poetry of Edwin Arlington Robinson</p>
<p>The poetry of the American poet Edwin Arlington Robinson seems to be generally neglected by society and critics. In circles that hotly discuss poetry, his poems are rarely mentioned. However, his poems are highly regarded in circles of more sophisticated scholars, especially his "Captain Craig" and "The Man Who Died Twice." They feel that after Whitman's death and Hardy's old age, Robinson's poetry can be compared to Hardy's.</p>
<p>During his lifetime, he received praise from Amy Lowell. In his dramatic monologue "John Brown," he borrowed a fairy-like person to say: "If I die, I have more to say." Indeed, thirteen years after his death, his new collection of letters was published, and he said a lot. His voice, like the voice in his poem "Luke Havergal," seems to be "coming from the grave to tell you."</p>
<p>The recently published collection of Robinson's letters is the second volume, more than twice the size of the first volume. The first volume was edited by Ridgely Torrence in 1940. The current volume covers the period from 1890 to 1905, including his time at Harvard. These letters were written to Harry DeForest Smith, a childhood friend who later became a professor of Greek at Amherst. Smith was one of the few people Robinson trusted, and he could confide in him about his intentions for writing poetry and the nature of poetry. These letters are particularly moving. Not because he is a letter writer, he simply pours out his honest words.</p>
<p>He wrote in a letter to Smith: "Sometimes I think hell is not so bad. If there is sulfur, it may be a little unpleasant, but I think a person does not need to be afraid of it. Think about his companions. If you and I were sitting on a fiery, red cobblestone reading Daudet and Zola, wouldn't that be a pleasant thing?"</p>
<p>Robinson's reputation as a poet came from effort, not from innate talent. He had been a special student at Harvard; he studied Shakespeare and Hawthorne on his own for two years at Harvard, and he wanted to cooperate with Smith to translate Sophocles' "Antigone" into unrhymed English verse.</p>
<p>He also said in his letter, "I am now writing Luke Havergal, and this is not a joke." Later, this poem became his masterpiece.</p>
<p>We hope to discover more of Robinson's manuscripts, and we also hope to find his short stories that could not be sold. Only when there is more material can we write a detailed study of his biography and poetry.</p>
<p>This old collection of letters was edited by Denham Sutcliffe. The book title is very special, called "Untriangulated Stars." We hope to forget this strange book title.</p>

<h3 id="e146">University Faculty and Staff <a href="#e146" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c146" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">146</a></h3>
<p>— Yijun</p>
<p>Let me tell you a little about the situation of professors and staff in universities. Professors are poor and busy, while staff, in addition to being poor and busy, are also considered cheap.</p>
<p>A few days ago, a few professors received their salaries, and each of them carried a large bundle of banknotes, and smiled bitterly at each other: "Forty dollars." Listening to their calculation: "Before the war, a sesame cake cost one cent. Now, ten thousand yuan can only buy two sesame cakes, which is equivalent to two cents at that time. A salary of twenty million yuan is exactly equal to forty yuan. This is only in terms of eating. If we talk about the standard of clothing, it is less than forty yuan!" With such poor treatment, how can they not be poor? Some poor professors have poor nutrition, are mentally weak, and are not well-dressed. They don't look like professors at all.</p>
<p>Because of poverty, they have to be busy. Being busy helps alleviate poverty, so they can avoid starving to death. How are they busy? The most common situations are two types: one is that because they can't afford a nanny, they are busy holding their children, buying groceries, cooking, and even emptying chamber pots. I have personally seen a professor teach four classes in a row in the morning, and when he came back, he had to start the fire to cook. The second is that they teach part-time at other schools. It is common for one person to teach at three or four schools. The head of my department not only teaches part-time at other schools, but also serves as the head of the department there. Professors are so busy and exhausted that, even if they don't "mislead students," it will at least have an impact on them. As a result of being tired and running around, some treat teaching as "just going through the motions."</p>
<p>Because professors have too much daily mobility, when students have questions that they want to ask or discuss with the professor, they often "wear out iron shoes without finding a place." Even if they are lucky enough to find him, he may not welcome you, because he needs to rest. Some professors teach at so many schools that they can only come two or three times a week, plus sick leave and personal leave, the chances of meeting them are even fewer. Once we see him coming to class, we can't help but feel "what wind blew you here."</p>
<p>Professors in foreign universities are often scientists, inventors, or writers. They are educators, not just "non-stop" teachers. Compared to them, we are really incomparable.</p>
<p>I have expressed my concern about professors being so poor and busy. Now I want to talk about the staff, who are poor, busy, and also "cheap." Although professors are poor and busy, they are still respected by people, and the school authorities treat them with the courtesy of honored guests, and can allocate several rooms for them to live in. But what about the staff? They are treated like discarded shoes. They cannot do anything without official documents, they cannot speak without official jargon, they bury their heads in hard work, and they must also swallow their anger. It is said that in the past, a school, in order to correct this phenomenon of discrimination against staff, reversed the habitual order of faculty and staff in their titles, calling them "staff faculty." The intention was good, but if it is only about reversing the order of one or two words, it is ultimately treating the symptom and not the cause.</p>
<p>However, in any case, these are just minor issues. The big problem is still poverty. The faculty and staff in universities are really too poor.</p>
<p>Because I am a poor student, I cannot help but "sympathize with fellow sufferers."</p>
<h3 id="e147">Squeezed Out Articles <a href="#e147" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c147" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">147</a></h3>
<p>— Zhong Xiuda</p>
<p>The "squeeze" discussed here is not the same in nature as Mr. Lu Xun's "push" and "kick," but a practical issue in writing.</p>
<p>I vaguely remember that a few days ago, a gentleman wrote an article in this magazine entitled "Talking About Not Being Able to Write." At that time, I only read it very hastily. That gentleman probably advocated that writing should be "according to one's feelings." When there is nothing to write, one should simply not write, not force it, and not exhaust it. This statement, of course, has its reasons, because works that are forced out are often mediocre. In order to avoid making readers dislike them, it is better not to write. This is a very pure view, and it is the attitude that scholars should have. However, it is not entirely necessary to say that in order to avoid one's works being "mediocre" or having a "pretentious" air, one must "accord with one's feelings." Writing good articles usually requires inspiration. Works written when one is inspired are always better than those written without inspiration. This is a fact that we cannot deny. However, inspiration does not last forever, and there is no simple method available for artificial creation. If one must "accord with one's feelings" and wait for inspiration, how painful is that? And what if one is writing an article and has not had inspiration or a good mood for a long time?</p>
<p>In terms of quality, I think one can still write some good works even without inspiration. Mr. Lu Xun said that most of his articles were "squeezed" out through painstaking effort in ordinary times. Now when we read his works, we do not feel that they are mediocre or pretentious at all, and they are simply worthy of being called "good." Therefore, I believe that the quality of a work does not depend entirely on whether there is inspiration, but more importantly on the author's attitude when writing.</p>
<p>This is "squeezing." This laborious and nerve-wracking thing is, of course, a painful thing. However, strangely, some people cannot even get the opportunity to "squeeze." A few days ago, I heard Mr. Xu Qinwen describe with frustration his writing situation in recent years. He said that as long as he has two or three hours of free time, he can "squeeze" out something, but due to the pressure of life, he cannot write, let alone think about writing a good work. It can be seen that in today's society, "squeezing" is not a right that everyone has.</p>
<h3 id="e148">Autumn Thoughts in Chongqing <a href="#e148" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c148" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">148</a></h3>
<p>— Bi Xun</p>
<p>Endless west wind blowing on the water, the sound of the tide and the shadows of sails remind me of past travels. In the cool drizzle, swallows fly in pairs, cutting through the clear river, a flute sounds with autumn.</p>
<p>I brew new tea over a live fire, and the lamp shines in the small building, keeping each other company. The white reeds glow on the river, and the green maple trees are old. My dreams revolve around my fifty-stringed zither.</p>
<p>The Jialing River is filled with bamboo branch songs, people come and go, singing "What to do?" Leaning on the railing, I listen to the night rain. The courtyard of phoenix trees gets more of the autumn.</p>
<p>Returning from the hunt, the moon is full in the camp. In the dragon river tiger tent, we talk about military affairs at night. An old scholar still has heroic ambitions, riding alone in the autumn wind, with ten thousand miles of feelings.</p>
<p>Sparse willows on the stone bridge reflect the slanting river, the flowing water and roosting crows sob in the evening smoke. Ten thousand points of new sorrow have nowhere to settle, a fishing fire hangs like a star across the river.</p>
<p>A lonely lamp in the small courtyard is afraid of the return of autumn. How many times have the yellow flowers on the path bloomed? After counting the returning geese, I cannot sleep. Deep in the night, there is still the call of the partridge!</p>
<h3 id="e149">Veteran Members of This Newspaper in the Past <a href="#e149" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c149" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">149</a></h3>
<p>— Zheng Yimei</p>
<p>In the late Qing Dynasty, this newspaper had a flourishing talent pool. As far as I know, there was Wang Ziquan, known as the Hermit of the Southern Sky. He was from Changzhou and liked to travel. His business card had titles such as "Resident of Europe and the West, Poet of the Eastern Waves, Hermit of the Southern Sky, and Recluse of Songbei." The title of "Recluse of Songbei" meant that he was registered with this newspaper and lived in Shanghai. He, Qian Xinbo, known as the Guest Viewing Flowers in the Mist, and He Guisheng, known as the Cold Food Scholar of Gaochang, were known as the Three Talents of this newspaper at the time. Xinbo was skilled in poetry, lyrics, and parallel prose, but his eyesight was poor. He could not see distant objects clearly, hence the name "Guest Viewing Flowers in the Mist." Guisheng was well-versed in classical learning, and many people followed him, such as Gao Taichi and Zhou Pinjiao, who were the most prominent. Guisheng then ordered Taichi and Pinjiao to assist in managing the editing affairs of this newspaper. Taichi once formed the Xishe society with various poets and lyricists and served as its chief. Pinshan was from Anhui, with the alias "The Sick Lyricist," and he took a concubine named Erbao, so he also called himself the Master of the Yunshi Building. Later, he left this newspaper and took charge of the Xiaoxianlu section of the Tongwen Shanghai News. Huang Shiquan of Puzuo, with the alias Master of the Wanxiangliumengshi Studio, also known as Mengwansheng, excelled in parallel prose, which was elegant and magnificent, and could be called unique. He took over the overall management of this newspaper after He Guisheng. He often visited the opera houses and wrote the Pink Ink Collection of Talks in the newspaper, which was later published as a single volume, paving the way for opera commentary. Cai Zihao, known as the Fairy Historian of Lvxin, from Shanghai, whose personal name was Erkang. I have a business card of his, which lists his title as Deputy Editor of the Shen Bao, indicating that Cai was also a former member of this newspaper. In addition, there was Yuan Xiangfu, known as the Old Master of Cangshan, the grandson of Jianzhai, who, when he took charge of this newspaper, built the Yangliuloutai near the Hu family residence on Fuzhou Road, planting rows of willows in front of the door, with green strands fluttering, which gave a refreshing mood. Xiangfu often drank and chanted poetry with his friends there, almost unaware of the disturbances in the world. Most interesting was Zhu Zimei of Qicheng, whose personal name was Changding. He was a top student at the Longmen Academy. His writing style was unrestrained and commendable. The director of this newspaper admired him and hired him to write essays. His essays were voluminous and often hit the mark, which were deeply welcomed by readers. The senior Shanghai Shushisheng was close to him and once said that Zimei stayed at the newspaper office and liked to stroll the streets every night. When he returned, he would buy food and put it in his sleeves. When he was in high spirits, he would chew on it along the way, which was his habit. One cold night, he bought frozen pork trotters, wrapped them in dry lotus leaves, and still hid them in his sleeves on his way home. On the way, he tasted a piece of it. Unexpectedly, a foreign mastiff happened to be nearby, smelled the meat, and pounced on him, almost biting his hand. Zimei was frightened and at a loss, and the remaining meat fell to the ground from his sleeves. He could only let the mastiff eat its fill, stomping his feet and shouting in vain. His colleagues in the office knew about it and used it as a laughing stock. Also, Han Ziyi, known as Han Tai Xian, was from Rongcheng. He worked for this newspaper for many years and gained experience in pleasure trips. He wrote a book called Spring and Autumn Annals of the Land of Flowers. Just as Cao Xueqin used Beijing dialect to write Dream of the Red Chamber, this book used the soft language of Wu. After it was completed, it was published under the name The Biography of Flowers on the Sea. When it was reprinted, Hu Shi even wrote a preface for it. There was also Yang Naiwu, who was involved in the Xiaobaicai case. It was said that after he was acquitted and released from prison, he joined this newspaper as an editor. However, it is not clear whether this is true or not. (Editor's note: Yang Naiwu once served as a correspondent for this newspaper in Shaoxing.)</p>
<h3 id="e150">Pigeon Peak <a href="#e150" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c150" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">150</a></h3>
<p>— Qian Dacheng</p>
<p>On the western end of Mount Lu, there is a peak called Pigeon Peak. Below it lies Jin Peak Villa, also known as Bottle Lodge, with its back against the green mountains and the evening glow like rosy clouds. Facing Shang Lake, spring always lingers with fragrance. It was the place of seclusion after the dismissal of Grand Secretary Weng Changshu of the former Qing Dynasty. Therefore, he was later buried here. In front of his tomb stood nine large characters written by Weng himself: "Tomb of Weng Tongsu, Dismissed Minister." It was not until the reign of Emperor Xuantong, after his rehabilitation and posthumous title were granted, that his remains were moved to the Weng family ancestral hall.</p>
<p>After Weng's dismissal, the Qing court ordered local officials in Yanzhou to supervise him strictly. Therefore, on the first and fifteenth of each month, Weng would walk to the county yamen of Changshu and Zhaowen to see the county magistrates, being respectful and sincere, as if facing a sovereign. However, the local officials felt very uneasy towards him.</p>
<p>Weng once walked from Pigeon Peak to the city. He wrote a poem saying: "A sail accompanies me along the mountain, the rolling Yangtze River's anger is not calmed; tell the dragons not to cause trouble, for I am accustomed to hearing the sound of angry waves." The meaning is profound, and the underlying message undoubtedly contains condemnation for the treacherous officials in the court.</p>
<p>When Weng lived in the village, he never mentioned his official career. If someone mentioned matters of the court, he would show anger on his face. He also did not associate with high-ranking officials, only maintaining close relationships with his nephew, Yu Jinmen, a licentiate, and Wu Honglun, a promising scholar. Despite the distance between the town and the countryside, their correspondence never ceased. He would treat visiting scholars in plain clothing with courteous words. If a woodcutter asked him to paint, he would gladly pick up the brush. However, if a high official sought an ink treasure, he would ignore it for years or have Zhao Guni paint in his stead. Yet, when ordering dishes from the Jinfangyuan Restaurant in the city, he would write the order himself. The restaurant staff knew to treasure these, and over the years, they accumulated a stack of them, which they would show to others, who would all admire them.</p>
<p>As Weng was dying, he showed a farewell poem to his family, saying: "In sixty years of life, bitterness reached the coffin's lid. I will not shed two lines of tears lightly for you all." A狀元 (top scholar) and prime minister is what people envy. Yet, he felt his life was bleak. Those who seek prominence in the world should take heed.</p>
<p>In the early years of the Republic of China, Kang Youwei and Chen Sanli came to pay respects at his tomb, generously rewarding the tomb keeper. Youwei claimed that Weng had recommended him to Emperor Dezong of the Qing Dynasty, saying that his talent surpassed his own tenfold. However, when asked if this was in Weng's diary, it was not found. Yu Jinmen repeatedly denied that such a thing had occurred, and also said that Weng had strongly advised Jinmen not to associate with Youwei, calling him a person of ill intent. Whether this is true or false, it should be a matter for those researching the Qing history to investigate and verify.</p>

<p>The rooster crows in the fields, every dawn, for everyone who hears it at dawn.</p>
<p>Life is suffering, it is an adventure, so life is a battle.</p>
<p>Don't worry about "yesterday," isn't "today" enough for you to cry and laugh?</p>
<p>Talent is the sublimation of emotion.</p>
<p>Dreams are the sublimation of inspiration.</p>
<p>A leaking house is still a house; but once it collapses, it is no longer a house.</p>

<p>— Hongxian</p>
<p>Lodging with relatives was never a long-term solution, so out of desperation, I pawned off some of my less essential belongings and found a shack in Jiang湾 to live in. After paying a relatively low rent for a month, I felt much lighter.</p>
<p>Who knew that the National Games being held in Jiang湾 would cause the price of shacks near the Games venue to increase tenfold instantly, and rent was now collected daily. It was said that the daily rent was one to two million yuan. If one rented for half a month, they could earn tens of millions. Unfortunately, my rented room was near the venue, and the landlord was also the kind of person who only cared about money. For the sake of his windfall fortune, he did not hesitate to "arm" his words and issue an eviction notice.</p>
<p>I couldn't blame him, because that's just how reality is. In order to discuss new renting terms later, I unconditionally gave in and had to move back to my relative's house. I had to take the moving costs there and back as my own bad luck. From this, one can see that it is difficult to live in Shanghai, and even the suburban towns are no exception.</p>

<h3 id="e153">Lucky Friday <a href="#e153" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c153" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">153</a></h3>
<p>— Mao Yi</p>
<p>In Western superstition, Friday is considered an unlucky day. However, turning the pages of American history, since white people discovered the New World, there has been a series of happy events that occurred on Fridays. Therefore, Friday can be said to be the luckiest day in American history. Here are ten of the more important examples:</p>
<p>August 3, 1492, Friday—Columbus set sail from Spain to his "India" in mind.</p>
<p>October 12, 1492, Friday—Columbus discovered the New World.</p>
<p>November 22, 1493, Friday—Columbus landed in the Americas again.</p>
<p>June 12, 1494, Friday—The South American continent was discovered.</p>
<p>March 5, 1496, Friday—King Henry VIII of England ordered the organization of a naval fleet to survey the New World, resulting in the discovery of North America. (Columbus' activities were limited to the West Indies.)</p>
<p>September 7, 1565, Friday—Spanish Navy Admiral Menéndez de Avilés founded St. Augustine in Florida, the oldest city in the United States.</p>
<p>November 10, 1620, Friday—One hundred and twenty Protestants fleeing religious persecution in England landed in Provincetown, sowing the seeds of American independence.</p>
<p>February 22, 1732, Friday—George Washington was born.</p>
<p>October 17, 1777, Friday—British General Burgoyne surrendered to the Continental Army at Saratoga, a turning point in the American Revolutionary War.</p>
<p>October 19, 1781, Friday—British General Cornwallis, besieged in Newark, surrendered, and there were no more traces of British troops in the United States.</p>
