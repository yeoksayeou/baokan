<h3>軍政首長紛集首都　傳作義馬鴻逵宋子文等日內飛京　總統昨再度召宴閻錫山</h3>
<p>〔本報南京下九日電〕各地軍政首長連日紛紛應總統電召來京，計已抵達者有閻錫，胡宗南，將抵京者有虞漢，並聞傳作義，馬鴻達，宋子文等亦將於一二日內來京，可能由總統召集會議，集議若干問題，惟該項會議係何項性質，現尚無法探悉。</p>
<p>〔本報南京廿九日電〕閻錫山將軍抵京後，與京中中極要員接觸訪晤頻繁，並備受各方之重視與歡迎。總統廿九日中午再度設宴歡迎閻氏，席間僅約請張羣·徐永昌·吳忠信·梁化之等數人作陪。廿九日晨，于院長右任首往訪閻氏，十時，張羣再度往訪，並約閻氏同赴人和街張宴，下午二時，閣氏辭出總統官邸，往晤賈副院長景德，並與徐永昌有所商談，四時出席立委之歡迎會，五時復先後往訪顧祝同及李副總統宗仁，晚七時應賈副院長景德宴，迄晚十時猶未返抵寓邸。廿九日前往寗海路四號往訪閻氏者，自晨至晚，絡繹不絕，計有于右任·張羣·黃紹肱·顧祝同·湯恩伯·谷正綱·谷正鼎·余漢謀·張耀明·吳思豫·狄膺·毛人鳳·徐堪·俞鴻鈞·鄭彥菜·馬超俊等數十人，下午十一時猶有山西及華北籍立監委等多人候晤閻氏。</p>
<h3>閻錫山出席立委茶會　娓娓報告晉軍情　全塲熱烈歡迎掌握時起</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿九日電〕立院全體委員廿九日下午四時假國大會堂二樓大廳舉行茶會，歡迎太原綏署主任閻錫山將軍，童院長及劉副院長方連袂驅車往迎，閻氏已偕隨員蒞臨會塲，當由會衆公推張道藩委負暫代主席，張氏首稱：「閻百川先生以艱苦卓絕精神，於抗戰八年後，復與匪鬥爭三年之久，深令吾人敬佩，今日國家危難之際，蒞臨首都，並出席本院同人之歡迎會，尤使吾人引為榮幸」。繼卽請閻氏報告普省及太原戰役情况，閻氏甫立於擴音器前，各委負卽報以熱烈掌聲，閻氏先謙稱，此行僅為述職，渠本人負一省行政之責，今僅餘太原孤城，竟得各委員熱情推愛，如是關切，實令渠感愧交集。閻氏次卽叙述太原之戰謂，半年來晋中戰事約可分為兩階段，一為夏征時期，卽麥季，一為秋征時期，卽秋收季節，麥季野戰延績三月，國軍協助人民搶收麥子後，卽集中兵力，於秋征時期展開太原保衛戰，迄今為止，共軍巳發動六次總攻，先後損折兵力達廿六萬人，其中死傷十六萬人，潰散十萬人，經四次補充，現有兵力約四萬人。至國軍死傷，野戰中為六萬人，太原保衛戰中為三萬人，損失總數約為共軍三分之一，共軍以各種方式欺壓人民，驅赴前綫，故無辜死傷甚衆，此種行為，乃國軍所不忍為者。山西人民歷多年苦難，吃共黨之虧大，對其瞭解也特多，因之，善良人民無條件反共，軍隊政府及人民合作無間，有此因素，共黨之攻勢野心乃迄未得逞。閻氏強調太原防務決無問題，雖原有飛機塲四個中一個失守，三個亦時受砲火影響，然近已新闢兩個，另一個亦在修築中，均處於絕對安全之地區，故空運交通無慮。閻氏復舉例說明，共軍之政治攻勢在晋亦告失敗，雙方喊話班於前綫辯論時，共軍每每理屈，最近自山東調往之兩萬新兵到達太原戰塲之第一日，卽被我方喊過來兩百餘人（鼓掌）。共軍歷次發動總攻時，太原城內每落砲彈，且有死傷，但軍民仍一致力戰不撓，故勝敗是一回事，決心又是一回事（鼓掌）。至此，閻氏再以軍調部小組在晋工作時情况為例，指出共軍之主要政略為欺騙，而事實上，欺騙敵人乃理所當然者，彼如不詐，乃彼之錯，我若受欺，則是我錯。渠稱，共黨反對資本主義之立塲，乃決不肯妥協者，而其不以制度為目標，殘酷殺人，實為不能巧言謊飾之罪行，共黨之基本錯誤，在認定病理，，忽視生理，置民族生命於不顧終必失敗無疑。閻氏於大鼓掌聲中結束其報告後，童院長復簡短致詞，首謂，大家歡迎之情，乃發自內心者，繼稱：「閻先生今日為全國人民所景仰，決非偶然，乃若干年來閻先生為人民，為國家努力奮鬥之結果，今國事嚴重，閻先生之勁節可以歲寒而後知松柏之後凋一語喻之，令人相信，閻先生必能運用其智慧，協助中央，掃除當前困難，為國家人民開闢一條生路」。童氏並代表全院同人祝閻氏健康。旋各委員紛趨前與閻氏握手歡叙，其情况之熱烈，令記者頓憶民國三十五年二月國民黨二中全會在渝舉行時，傅作義將軍於綏，包解圍後赴會蒞臨議塲中之情景，閻將軍老當益壯，容光煥發，娓娓報告三晋軍情，始終從容含笑，令人對太原前途增無限信心，至五時許賓主盡歡而散。</p>

<h3>存兌金銀決恢復　元月五日銀行開業時繼續辦理在存兌原款項外再加收平衡費</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿九日電〕暫停巳近一週之金元券存款兌換金銀辦法，廿九日政務會中已決議恢復存兌，並決議定於明年元月五日銀行開業時繼續辦理存兌工作，惟以金銀黑市價格與存兌款額相距過遠，且與外匯移轉證價格亦不相伴，故會中復決議，恢復存兌時，在存兌之原款項外，再加平衛費，至平衡費之價格，則由央行掛牌，其計算係以當日央行僑匯差額掛牌，按五十美元折合黃金一兩之比例，計算黃金價格差額，是項差額，卽為平衡費之數字。此項新辦法實行時，每人憑身份證每三個月准許兌換黃金一兩或銀元四十九枚之規定，仍不改變。廿九日政務會時，各政委對於此項新辦法商討甚久，並決定為澈底改善存兌辦法，及穩定整個物價漲潮計，應由財部會同央行擬訂澈底之根本辦法，此項酌收平衡費辦法，仍屬過渡性質，在根本辦法擬訂後，過渡辦法仍應繼續改善。</p>

<h3>外記者證明蘇援助中共</h3>
<p>〔合衆社北平記者季昂廿九日電〕現有不斷之證據，可證明蘇聯已逐漸越過中立之界綫，以意見及援助給予東北之共產黨。根據記者於上週中目共軍陣綫回來之談話中可證實南京政府發言人於廿八日晚發表文告稱蘇聯人在東北出現一事，至少蘇聯以技術援助給予共方。在若干時日以前，此間曾聽到報告稱：蘇聯以旅順大連兩基地上之飛機飛臨山東半島及國軍區域上空。記者曾偷聽兩名共產黨政工人負間之談話，已獲得蘇聯人在東北之確切證明·據彼兩人中一人宣稱：蘇聯鐵路技術人負曾協助中共修理中共所佔領地區中之鐵路。該共產黨員顯然不注意到記者能曉得彼等談話中之一部份。</p>
<p>關於非中國之共產黨員亦有在共軍中服務一節，記者可證明北平附近之共軍中有朝鮮人及日本人祖任聯勸事務。</p>
<p>最近中共中央委員劉少寄廣播之文告，乃為中蘇共產黨加緊連繫之另一證明。劉氏曾強調稱：中國共產黨乃世界革命運動之一部份。劉氏並對南斯拉夫狄托總理之國家主義思想加以攻擊，並譴責狄托未能明瞭共產主義計劃性之世界。</p>

<h3>日本總選的趨勢</h3>
<p>日本議會廿三日宣佈解散以後，政府巳於廿七日正式宣佈：日本全國普選定期明年一月廿三日舉行。現各政黨巳於廿七日起，辦理候選人之登記手續，並揭出美麗的政策，凖備選舉投票前之各項競選佈置。參加下屆新議會競選的政黨，計有民主自由黨，民主黨，社會寫，協同黨，共產黨等。在各政黨的活動佈置中，　　吉田首相領導的民自黨最佔優勢：一般的觀測，均認民自黨及其保守勢力，可能獲得下屆總選的勝利，而未來的政權仍屬於保守勢力，或更傾向右傾與保守。我們對於日本即將來到的日本總選，不願遽作何黨何派勝利的判斷，我們必須指出：今天日本偽裝的民主政治是如何的飛揚發展，以及其未來的趨勢。</p>
<p>日本議會分中央地方兩級，各都道府縣議會為地方議會組織，中央議會分參議衆議兩院，憲法上稱為國會。衆院即英國議會之下議院，衆院議席的多數為第一黨，內閣即由第一黨負責組織之。在習慣上，內閣多以聯合政府的姿態出現，一黨政府也不抵觸憲法。去年四月總選後，社會黨握衆院第一黨地位，後來由於社會民主兩黨內部的分化，加強了民自的陣營，民自黨竟一躍為衆院的第一黨；社會黨淪為第二黨，民主黨仍為第三黨，他如協同黨共產黨等，均為衆院之少數黨，其動向並不影響政局。比較能够支配政局的，仍為民自，社會，民主三黨，故三黨的動向，可作為全般政局動向的說明。</p>
<p>衆院議席共四六六席，現在各黨提出的候選人，為數巳在二千人以上，尤以民自黨的提名為最多，計提三百二十名，希望至少能當選百分之八十，占衆院議員總額過半數，俾便於總選後組織強有力之保守統一內閣。該黨書記長廣川很自信的說：深信在民自黨三百個候選人中，至少有二百五十人當選，倘民自黨亦新議會中佔優勢，民主黨將加以支持。吉田宣怖普選時期之日，他很自負的說：在未來總選中，民自黨有獲勝的完全信心，政府必須採取若干措施，以防止共產黨獲得重要地位，而破壞麥帥指令的復興計劃。其次民主黨提候選人一百五十名，由於吉田的支持，希望能獲得百卅名的議席。民主黨因昭和·炭管·纖維三大貪汚案，該黨同社會黨的處境一樣，盡失人民信仰，將來能否獲得理想的議席，一方面要看該黨新任總裁犬養健同民自黨的關係，另方面要看投票人的選擇了。再次為社會寫，該寫左右搖擺不定，年來信用日趨壓落，現提出候選人一百六十七名，該黨選舉對策本部很無把握的估計，將來可能當選百廿名，如情形惡劣時，約為九十名。他如協同黨共產黨各小黨，候選提名均較前屆選舉增加，協同黨佔衆院廿九席，現提名達一百名，共產黨佔衆院四席，現亦提名至百人，足徵本屆總選的小黨地位，是未可忽視的。</p>
<p>根據以上分析，我們可以指出日本本屆總選的趨勢：（一）民自黨民主黨的保守勢力陣綫，可能獲得總選的勝利，民自黨穩取衆院第一黨的地位。麥帥指令加速日本經濟復興的指令，和聖誕節赦免日戰犯十七名罪行，這都是給予保守勢力重大鼓勵的明證，增加了民自民主兩黨競選的戚力；（二）社會黨如無左翼的聯合，可能一厥不振，而落於民主黨之後。協同共產各小黨因未涉貪汚事件，選票可能增加很多，但它在未來的議會中，不會發生決定性或支配政局的力量。總之，未來日本政局大勢，屬於保守勢力，政策愈益走上右傾，不免逐漸復活軍國主義的體制，其趨勢是很明白的。</p>

<h3>遠東美軍有新部署　南韓步兵第七師撤至日本駐日空運十一師奉調返美　麥帥部下將級軍官更換指揮軍力减少</h3>
<p>〔中央社東京廿九日電〕據美國陸軍部今聲明稱：遠東美軍技術部隊將舉行普遍調整，最先準入日本之空運部隊第十一師將奉調返美，而由自南韓撤退之美國步兵換防。在日軍力之重行分配，可能使麥帥指揮下之軍力減少，因第七師不致全部由南韓撤退至日本。（權威人士告記者稱：美軍仍將有若干留駐南韓。）因十一師為美國在日之惟一空運部隊，故該師之返國，將使麥帥部下無空運部隊。陸軍部前曾宣稱：若干將級軍官，包括麥帥參謀長將奉召返國，另有任命。此一政策將使所有麥帥指揮下之將級軍官均受影響，軍隊調整及將級軍官之更調，將使麥帥指揮下軍力减少，並朱去若干渠極為信任之指揮官。</p>
<p>〔美國新聞處華盛頓廿八日電〕美國陸軍今日宣佈撤退一部份駐韓美軍之計劃。美軍此舉係遵照最近聯合國大會之決議案。根據該決議案：韓境佔領軍隊應在可能範圍內及旱撤離。</p>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓廿八日電〕美國駐韓軍隊總額，官方最近並未宣布，僅知去年五月間約為三萬名左右，第七師人數則為一萬五千名，故該師之撤退，等於减少南競駐軍之半。北韓蘇聯佔領軍亦巳開始絡續撤退，蘇方宣布，撤軍係於九月間開始，將於一九四九年一月一日前完成。北韓蘇軍員額遠較南韓美軍為多。加之，北韓復有蘇聯訓練與配備之警察達二十萬名之多。美軍訓練之南韓保安隊至多不過六萬名。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社東京廿九日電〕麥帥總部今日發表公報稱南韓美佔領軍現巳開始撤退。又稱，撤軍之實現，係在朝鮮共和國成立及聯合國決定令美蘇儘早撤退駐軍後，撤退之美軍將調往日本，以代替業已由運輸機運載返國之某部隊。</p>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓廿八日電〕頃據可靠消息，美國將於一月一日後正式承認南韓政府，並將同時任命總統特使繆錫俄為美國首任駐韓大使。韓國駐美大使人選則尚未獲悉。美國佔領軍撤離韓國，雖係按照預定計劃進行，但決非表示美軍將全部撤退之意。留駐部隊諒為戰鬥隊伍。</p>
<p>〔聯合社漢城廿九日電〕朝鮮總統李承晚今日宣稱，一部份美軍雖描退，韓國國防仍極安全，余信我國國防軍在短時期之內當可無須大規模之外力。美國總統註韓代表繆錫俄今日曾偕第二十四兵團司令柯爾德訪會李氏。據繆氏稱，美國正式承認韓國政府確期尚未由華盛頓通知，大致不出數日。</p>
<h3>安理會通過英國建議　令阿猶立即停戰　兩軍應退回原防違則考慮制裁　英聲明無意援用英埃條約</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕巴黎廿九日廣播：安理會今日討論聖地問題時，英代表貝利宣稱，渠曾獲英駐埃大使館之報告，猶太軍已侵八埃境約三十哩，激戰已進行數日。安理會以此舉可能牽涉一九三六年所締結之英埃條約，條約中規定一方被侵略時，他方應「立卽」援助，故會塲空氣立見緊張。</p>
<p>當卽以八票通過英國建議，命令巴勒斯坦立卽停戰，雙方軍隊應退駐原防，並立卽進行停戰協商。決議中並規定巴勒斯坦委員會應於一月七日在成攻湖續開，並對埃猶雙方是否服從停戰令一點提出報告。如雙方均不肯停戰，則安理會將根據以往決議，考慮制裁辦法。安理會並通過法國修正案，令埃猶二方應接受聯合國觀察員到塲監視停戰實况。今日棄權之三國為美·蘇·烏克蘭。美代表稱未獲華府指示，蘇代表則對停戰令一點投贊成票。又倫敦訊，英外部發言人稱，猶軍雖已侵入埃及，但英國目前無意引用英埃條約。</p>

<h3>釋放印尼領袖履行停戰　荷答覆含糊其詞　安理會美蘇代表均表示不滿</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕巴黎廿九日廣播：荷代表范樂揚告安理會稱：荷蘭至遲將於三十一日午夜停止爪哇之戰鬥行動。但稱：蘇門答臘之戰事須二三日以後始能終止，因該處情形特殊。范氏並謂：印尼政治俘虜將於同時釋放，惟被俘各人須停止足以危害公衆安全之一切活動。荷總理德里斯將於數日內前往印尼，協力推進重建印尼之任務。</p>
<p>范氏謂：荷政府將予聯合國軍事觀察家及聯合國領事委員會委員以種種便利，便能編造安理會所需要之報告。英代表法拉稱：荷蘭已多少能迎合安理會之願望，究至若何程度，則須至明年一月初方能明瞭。蘇聯及美代表對荷蘭答覆認為不滿。美代表傑塞普指出屋期五通過之決議案中包括停戰及釋放政治俘虜二點，「荷蘭之聲明並未告知吾人其中任何一項業已遵行」，但傑氏續稱：「對於荷方不遵行一點，無須再提議案。」蘇代表馬立克稱：荷蘭敢作此種答復，乃因彼等在安理會中有高級保護人為之袒護之故。英美拒不投票使荷軍撤退實足鼓勵侵略者而使其胆敢作今日之答復。馬氏指責英代表團曾竭力阻止對侵略者採取有效行動</p>

<h3>四大公司營業增加一至四倍　顧主多爲過境旅客一般市民望價却步</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕連日物價波動聲中，記者昨分向南京路四大公司當局，探詢日來營業情形。所獲答覆，雖不無參差，惟一般營業額，均見增加。平均約較一週前增加自一倍至四倍不等。每日營業金額自三四十萬元起以至於一百萬元以上。據談：年常耶誕節及新年前後，一般公司營業均較平時增加，惟本年此時，適逢物價新漲風襲來，又加北方游資分批南溢，故營業額確較往年此時有額外之增加。據觀察，日來一般公司顧客，北方過境旅客及軍人特多，一般市民，頻受物價漲風之襲擊，雖不無罄其手頭餘款，購進急需之日用品者，惟為數究屬不多。故八一九後一階段間如火如荼之搶購風潮，尚不到重演。記者昨赴各大公司實地參觀，沉濟覽之顧客多於購貨之顧客。橱窗中所列各項貨品，一般均較耶誕節前漲起五成至一二倍。然各公司當局對物價之漲，營業額之增，並不感覺興趣。渠等認為：物價每次連續狂漲，首當其衝者卽為門市零售商店。批發物價儘可一日數易，暴漲時更可隨時停批，然零售物價，門市最多一日一易，且旣定價目，卽須以手頭存貨儘量供應，故每當批發價暴漲而與零售價脫節時，門市貨物卽有被搶購一空之危險。例如以一般棉織品而言，近日批價已連漲三倍，而公司之零售價尚僅漲五成，一時無法跟上結果各公司均大吃其虧云。　又外傳各大公司最近儘手頭存貨發售，所得資金儘量南匯，不再批淮新貨，各公司當局均加否認。渠等稱：公司有時在分發年節賞金時，因需大量資金，一時暫停淮貨，容或有之，惟一俟賞金調度完畢，仍繼續進貨，並無將資金大批南匯之事云。</p>

<h3>六大公用事業決發年獎一月</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕本市六大公用事業年獎決定發一個月。其中大多規定於一月十日一次發出按照本年十二月下期指數計算。法商水電則因勞資雙方曾訂有筆錄分二期發放，職工雖曾要求改一次發出，但為社會局所批駁。近英商電車公司工人擬請提早五天於一月五日發出，社會局趙副局長為此特於昨晨召見工曾負責人仇長江等談話，大致仍將按原規定日期發放。</p>

<h3>漁康輪失事沉沒　漁管處報告經過</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕漁管處總船長斯頌聲，副總船長劉景瑛，昨為漁康輪沉沒事件，假金門飯店招待記者，報告失事經過眞相，及營救經過。該處外籍顧問達維斯，愛却爾，漢奇等五人，均出席報告。綜合彼等之推斷，均認該漁輪之失事，實係遭遇不可抗之意外侵略所致。極當經騐之愛却爾認為該輪之失事，可能為魚艙門遭水冲擊受損而下沉，因渠曾得知該輪出事附近海面，曾發覺有此項艙板飄浮。據該處總船長斯頌聲氏介紹富有數十年航海經騐之達維斯稱；渠亦認為該輪失事可能係遭遇風浪後艙進水所致。斯總船長力謂漁管處開辦以來，為求業務之開展，卽聘有外籍專家多人專事指導及策劃，且對漁輪之管理與設備，均極適當與謹慎，從未稍有疏忽與大意。斯氏並發表書面報告，先述漁康輪在十月十五日與漁新號互撞後，漁康船首側受捐，卽折回沈家門修復，於廿二日繼續出漁，廿七日返滬。據輪機工程師會同修理廠技師檢查後下令修理，漁康於十一月二日出漁，當時並未有拒絕修理及強迫出漁之事。十一月廿五日漁康平安返滬，據修理廠報告，漁康廿五日要求修理四項，十二月一日又要求修理三項，均及時究成，惟七項中並無重要修理工作，漁康又於十二月二日出漁。</p>
<p>繼述失事之後搜查情形。據謂自漁康失事以後，該處漁船卽停止捕魚，全體參加搜索工作，達十日以上，其唯一希望在能獲得漁康輪全體船員下落，直至目前為止，仍有專人分往各島嶼及失事洋面負責找尋，冀能對得起遭難船員及其家屬。至於撫卹一項，處方自必予以從優給付。</p>
<p>要求修理均及時完成搜索營救達十日以上</p>

<h3>各地實際需要物資　轉口限制將予放寬　下季廣州台灣輸入額將酌增</h3>
<p>據輸管會息：七八兩季普通限額早已分配完舉，其經簽發輸入許可證者，每月平均約為五百萬美元左右，惟工業限額因各廠商未將各該同菜工會限額用戶彙送輸管會，致一時不能分配完畢，至九十兩季輸入限額，預料將不致較各埠以往之限額總歡為多。因現在係實行貿易連鎖，一方面須視出口之情形，一方更須顧及國家外匯頭寸之多少，統籌兼顧，至各埠限額之增减，大致廣州台灣兩地將酌增加，北方則將减少，惟目前局勢變化無定，以後各埠所配得之限額，恐未必符合實際需要，故對轉口限制予以放寬，俾使其能互相調劑云。</p>
<h3>人心堅俏異常　食米漲勢愈劇　南市塲薄稻突出七百元關</h3>
<p>食米漲勢愈見猛烈，因其他物價上漲均較米市為烈，况產地無錫價格巳與申價接近，故人心堅俏異常，南市塲開市卽漲一百元，中途雖略疲落，臨收終又猛漲，薄稻已突出七百元關外，為七百十元，狂漲一百七十元，特高粳及陰白元均已出七百兀外，白粳早稻各開六百九十元，各漲一百五六十兀，收市續見喊高。北市上漲較少，粳薄稻各漲一百三十元，昨日到貨一萬一千二百六十三石。</p>
<p>麵粉</p>
<p>猛漲未已，昨日漲勢更劇，開市聞米價上漲，貨主卽竭力扳持，老車粉甫開卽高達三百五十元，後更升至三百六十元，收市為三百五十九元，狂漲九十六元，達四成之鉅。兵船粉收市三百五十五元，亦猛挺九十六元，紅蜂·建成·各狂升四成左右，雜牌粉均升八九十元，麩皮亦告猛升，大包麩漲六十二元。</p>
<p>雜糧</p>
<p>上漲，如火如荼，初以米價上漲，人心堅昂，貨主竟難以喊價，交易開出至遲，價漲驚人，漢口乍豆達五百五十元高價，狂漲二百三十元，有七成之多。苞米靑帮力吸，貨主力扳，黃渡苞米高達五百五十元，漲二百元，紅糧挺一百二十元，揀靑·元麥一致漲四五成，菉豆猛跳尤厲，毛菉豆開七百元，幾加一倍，芝蔴挺四百元，白蔴出千元外，生仁先漲後跌，終軋漲二三百元。</p>
<p>食油</p>
<p>猛升疾落，風浪險惡，投機旺熱，上落有八百元之幅度，開市時竟無人售出，收市竟無受主，豆油最高三千三百元，生菜油最高三千二百元，後沺廠大量開出，加之業外物價報跌，疾瀉七八百元。豆油收市二千五百五十元，生菜油收市二千四百五十元，吉桶生油二千六百元，各漲二百元。豆餅出二百元，最高二百三十，收市二百十五元，漲三十元。</p>
<h3>食米油粉等市塲明日起休假度年</h3>
<p>新年將屆，本市各市場均將休菜度假，據悉，食米食油雜糧麵粉等市塲，將提前自明日起開始休假，明年元月四日起恢復紅盤云。</p>
<h3>國行發五十元鈔銀根鬆勢略轉斂</h3>
<p>中央銀行發言人，昨晨告稱：該行為便利工商週轉，適應市塲需要起見，開始增發五十元券一種，是項鈔券，係由中央印製廠承印，正反面均為平版，呈靑蓮色。</p>
<p>昨日本市銀根鬆勢略斂，物價全面上漲，各方需要殺切，而當局拋售紗布，收回通貨達數千萬元，業外搜單甚盛，雖外埠游資續有滲入，但市塲拆息，業已昂至十八元或廿元，最高廿二元有求，過年頭寸，昨做廿五兀，現鈔籌碼猶平，聞今後數日內，央行擬收縮通貨，至少五億元云。</p>
<h3>南北游資匯流本市當局考慮限制匯款</h3>
<p>據金融當局人員估計，目前流轉於本市之游資數量，總額當在十億元以上，且各地游資，日來仍在源源而來，彼指出此項游資之來處，不僅華北一地，卽華南港穗等地資金，最近亦有大量倒流上海現象，其原因係在於前一時期，本市物價穩定之故。彼並暗示當局可能考慮限制匯款來滬，以遇制此一泛濫之情形。蓋目前情形，單靠物資之拋售，已不足以收立時抽緊銀根之實效，卽以二十八日而論，政府拋出紗布所收回之通貨，約在三千八百萬元左右，而集中於市塲之游資，則在四億以上。</p>
<h3>各行莊增資現金應依期申請移存</h3>
<p>移存總額約為七五〇萬兀</p>
<p>關於商業行莊增資部份，現金移存問題，仍在優持狀態中。迄至昨晨為止，中央銀行仍未接獲行莊之移存申請，據該行人員稱：如至卅一日為止，各行莊仍朱申請移存，而財政部亦無展期等變通辦法頒佈，則依據已公佈之辦法，金融管理當局，有權吊銷其營業執照。惟彼認為時期雖甚緊迫，然此一問題，到期前必可獲致解決。</p>
<p>又據國行方面估計，本市商業行莊增資部份，應行移存之現金，總額約在七百五十萬元左右。</p>
<h3>外匯證掛高</h3>
<p>僑匯結算牌價，昨日第十二次掛高，為每美元合一〇〇金圓，較前又升八元，外匯移轉證，晨開猛竄進一二八出一二九元，後聞金鈔黑市價跳，各帮奮力競吸，價又晋升至一三〇元，旋出口商逢高有吐，中國銀行交通銀行，暗中大量拋售，價趨下游，收市指定銀行成交價進一一五元，出一一六元。</p>
<h3>茶市買氣彌漫</h3>
<p>茶市昨開卽聞圈外物價猛力上竄，人心沸騰，執貨者鑒於一旦脫售，　以彌補，故咸不忍割愛，趨勢形成有買無雙，交易卒稀，行情則直綫飛升，旋因業外各物一致報跌，寶戶對紅綠茶售意稍鬆，成交數量頓見步砌，惟仍以內銷花色，在本街等地買氣　漫中，做開獨多，至於外銷箱茶，以船期尙遠，輸出商態度若靜止水，衹有零星授受。</p>
<h3>食糖狂升</h3>
<p>食糖昨日市况續告上揚，連日漲勢雖烈，人心依然不小，各檔初開趨勢尙平，嗣聞業外各物再見上升，漲風彌漫，本街帮首起添辦，浮多拉抬，市勢由平轉挺，中間資多買少，塲內求多於供，喊價亂抬。</p>
<p>45號車白精晨開一三〇〇元，開後一片買進聲，執戶向高扳持，瞬息飛漲二百元，嗣後徘徊於一四六〇元一四八○元間，尙乏賣出，遂告收市，上升四三〇元</p>
<p>粗砂以九六〇元低盤登塲，一路上揚，高見一三八〇元了結，漲勢相並，興化赤未見做開後，其餘一概挨次上升。</p>
<h3>桐油初挺後回</h3>
<p>桐油昨市，晨開繼承連綿之昂風，並因外匯移轉證巍站及圈外各物猛升，故人心奇挺，賣戶喊價越級狂跳，市乃續趨昂途，價格方面，益發驚人。聞足度白油與靑油，每担俱達一千四五百元，迨至近午，突呈不支，漸見下游，緣因銀根轉緊，各物均起回風，居高思危者亦岡脫手，市氣卒告軟化，但比隔日軋升尙多。</p>
<h3>執戶猛力拉抬　紗布直綫飛跳　龍頭細布高見一三五零元</h3>
<p>棉紗漲勢似火如荼，由於利買空氣頻傳，加以圈外各物一致狂漲，故人心益形看好，散戶扒吸紛紜，執戶猛力拉抬，價逐直綫飛跳。</p>
<p>四二支又藍鳳晨開四八三〇〇元，午收為四〇〇〇〇元，四〇支藍鳳旋昂卽回，終以三八五〇〇元結局，軋升三二〇〇元·三二支銀月初在四〇〇〇〇元高峯開出，最後回小至三二〇〇〇元，終挺地〇〇〇元。</p>
<p>二一支雙馬現貨始喊三二八〇〇元，中途曾見三四五〇〇元之新高。收市回落至二八五〇〇元，軋好一一〇〇元，廠單二七五〇〇元，亦高一〇〇〇元。二〇支雙馬自三〇〇〇〇元喊低至二五五〇〇結束，軋高一二〇〇元，一六支紗均在二〇〇〇〇元關外做開，一〇支童子軍亦破二〇〇〇〇元大關。</p>
<p>昨日棉布撩起驚人之漲風，塲上祇聞一片買進之聲，執戶俱握住不售，喊價甚爲紊亂，大戶抬價而吸，龍頭細布初開卽衝破千元大關，晋一一八〇元之新高，是以貨主皆無意脫手，故形成有市無貨之局面，繼再喊俏至一二四五元，始有人賣出少數，後竟登一三五〇元高峰，臨收浮多獲利吐售，價乃回落至一一六〇〇元收市，結果較前猛跳三〇〇元之鉅。中檔細布俱在一二四五元最高價做開，以後則無交易。</p>
<p>四君子元嗶嘰始由一一〇〇元開出，中途雖曾進展至一二六〇元，但迄於收，仍為一一〇〇元結局，暴漲二六〇元。四君子元直貢最後做一一五〇元，狂升三一〇元，午後聞人心較虛，各布轉趨疲乏。</p>

<h3>Military and Political Leaders Gather in the Capital: Zuo Yi, Ma Hongkui, Song Ziwen, and Others Rumored to Fly to Beijing Soon; President Hosts Banquet for Yan Xishan Again Yesterday</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Nanjing, 9th] Military and political leaders from various regions have been arriving in Nanjing in response to the President's telegram summons in recent days. Those who have already arrived include Yan Xishan and Hu Zongnan. Those who are about to arrive include Yu Han. It is also rumored that Zuo Yi, Ma Hongda, Song Ziwen, and others will come to Beijing within the next day or two. It is possible that the President will convene a meeting to discuss certain issues collectively. However, the nature of the meeting is currently unknown.</p>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Nanjing, 29th] Since General Yan Xishan arrived in Beijing, he has been in frequent contact and meetings with key figures in the capital, and has received great attention and welcome from all parties. The President hosted another banquet to welcome Yan Xishan at noon on the 29th, inviting only a few people such as Zhang Qun, Xu Yongchang, Wu Zhongxin, and Liang Huaizhi to accompany him. On the morning of the 29th, President Yu Youren of the Executive Yuan was the first to visit Yan Xishan. At 10:00 am, Zhang Qun visited again and invited Yan Xishan to a banquet at Zhang's residence on Renhe Street. At 2:00 pm, Yan Xishan left the Presidential Residence to meet with Vice President Jia Jingde of the Examination Yuan, and also had discussions with Xu Yongchang. At 4:00 pm, he attended a welcome reception for legislators. At 5:00 pm, he visited Gu Zhutong and Vice President Li Zongren successively. At 7:00 pm, he attended a banquet hosted by Vice President Jia Jingde, and did not return to his residence until 10:00 pm. On the 29th, those who visited Yan Xishan at No. 4 Ninghai Road came in an endless stream from morning to night, including Yu Youren, Zhang Qun, Huang Shaohong, Gu Zhutong, Tang Enbo, Gu Zhenggang, Gu Zhengding, Yu Hanmou, Zhang Yaoming, Wu Siyu, Di Ying, Mao Renfeng, Xu Kan, Yu Hongjun, Zheng Yancai, Ma Chaojun, and dozens of others. At 11:00 pm, many legislators and supervisors from Shanxi and North China were still waiting to meet with Yan Xishan.</p>
<h3>Yan Xishan Attends Tea Party with Legislators: Eloquently Reports on the Situation of the Shanxi Army; The Whole Venue Warmly Welcomes Him with Standing Ovations</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Nanjing, 29th] The entire Legislative Yuan held a tea party in the main hall on the second floor of the National Assembly Hall at 4:00 pm on the 29th to welcome General Yan Xishan, Director of the Taiyuan Pacification Headquarters. President Tong and Vice President Liu Lian drove together to welcome him. When Yan Xishan arrived at the venue with his entourage, Zhang Daofan was publicly elected by the attendees to temporarily serve as chairman. Zhang stated, "Mr. Yan Baichuan, with his arduous and extraordinary spirit, fought with the bandits for three years after eight years of resistance against Japan, which is deeply admired by us. At this time of national crisis, his visit to the capital and attendance at the welcome reception of our colleagues in this Yuan make us feel especially honored." Then, he invited Yan Xishan to report on the situation in Shanxi Province and the Battle of Taiyuan. As soon as Yan Xishan stood in front of the microphone, the legislators responded with enthusiastic applause. Yan Xishan first humbly stated that this trip was only to report on his duties. He himself was responsible for the administration of a province, and now only the isolated city of Taiyuan remains. The enthusiastic support and concern of the legislators made him feel ashamed and grateful. Yan Xishan then described the Battle of Taiyuan, saying that the war in central Shanxi in the past six months could be divided into two stages: the summer conscription period, which was the wheat season, and the autumn conscription period, which was the autumn harvest season. The field battles during the wheat season lasted for three months. After the National Army assisted the people in harvesting the wheat, they concentrated their forces to launch the Battle of Taiyuan during the autumn conscription period. So far, the Communists have launched six general offensives, suffering a total loss of 260,000 troops, including 160,000 killed and wounded, and 100,000 dispersed. After four reinforcements, they now have about 40,000 troops. The National Army suffered 60,000 deaths and injuries in the field battles, and 30,000 in the Battle of Taiyuan, with a total loss of about one-third of the Communist forces. The Communists oppressed the people in various ways and drove them to the front lines, resulting in many innocent deaths and injuries, which the National Army could not bear to do. The people of Shanxi have suffered many years of hardship and understand the Communists especially well. Therefore, the good people unconditionally oppose the Communists, and the army, government, and people cooperate seamlessly. With this factor, the Communist offensive ambitions have not yet succeeded. Yan Xishan emphasized that there is absolutely no problem with the defense of Taiyuan. Although one of the original four airfields has been lost, and three others are affected by artillery fire from time to time, two new ones have recently been opened, and another is under construction, all located in absolutely safe areas, so there is no concern about air transport. Yan Xishan also cited examples to illustrate that the Communist political offensive has also failed in Shanxi. During debates between the shouting teams on the front lines, the Communists often ran out of arguments. Recently, on the first day that 20,000 new soldiers transferred from Shandong arrived at the Taiyuan battlefield, more than 200 of them were shouted over to our side (applause). Every time the Communists launched a general offensive, artillery shells fell in the city of Taiyuan, causing deaths and injuries, but the soldiers and civilians still fought unwaveringly. Therefore, victory or defeat is one thing, and determination is another (applause). At this point, Yan Xishan used the situation when the Military Mediation Department's group was working in Shanxi as an example, pointing out that the main strategy of the Communists is deception. In fact, deceiving the enemy is a matter of course. If they do not deceive, it is their mistake; if we are deceived, it is our mistake. He stated that the Communist Party's opposition to capitalism is a position that they will never compromise on, and their cruelty in killing people without a system as a goal is a crime that cannot be concealed by clever words. The fundamental mistake of the Communist Party is in recognizing pathology but neglecting physiology, disregarding national life, and will undoubtedly fail in the end. Yan Xishan concluded his report amidst great applause. President Tong then made a brief speech, first saying that everyone's welcome was heartfelt. He then stated, "Mr. Yan is admired by the people of the whole country today, which is by no means accidental. It is the result of Mr. Yan's efforts for the people and the country for many years. Now that the national affairs are serious, Mr. Yan's strength can be described with the saying 'one knows that the pine and cypress are the last to wither only after the cold season,' making people believe that Mr. Yan will be able to use his wisdom to assist the central government, eliminate the current difficulties, and open up a new path for the country and the people." President Tong also wished Yan Xishan good health on behalf of all the colleagues in the Yuan. Then, the legislators rushed forward to shake hands with Yan Xishan and talk cordially. The enthusiasm of the situation reminded the reporter of the scene when General Fu Zuoyi attended the Second Plenary Session of the Kuomintang in Chongqing in February 1935 after relieving the siege of Suiyuan and Baotou. General Yan, old but vigorous, with a radiant face, eloquently reported on the military situation in Shanxi, always composed and smiling, giving people infinite confidence in the future of Taiyuan. The guests and hosts parted happily at about 5:00 pm.</p>
<h3>The Control Yuan Will Host Yan Xishan Today; The Next Meeting of the Yuan Will Be Postponed by One Week</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Nanjing, 29th] The current affairs symposium held by the Control Yuan every Wednesday was held on the morning of the 29th, chaired by Vice President Liu Zhe. More than 30 members in Beijing attended. First, Tang Honglie reported on the progress and suggestions regarding the matters entrusted by the previous regular meeting on contacting evacuation, which lasted a long time, and it was decided: (1) A tea party will be held at 4:00 pm on the afternoon of the 30th to host Yan Xishan. It is said that the Yuan had previously decided to organize a frontline慰勞團 (comfort mission) to Pingjin and other places. Now that Yan Xishan is in Beijing, he can be directly慰問 (comforted) and pay his respects. (2) An ad hoc motion by Li Tingjun, divided into four points as follows: A. Telegraph each province to strengthen self-defense forces; B. Improve the treatment of soldiers; C. Improve the method of storing and exchanging gold and silver; D. Severely punish wealthy merchants and traitors. It was resolved to discuss detailed methods after research and then submit them to the next meeting for discussion. (3) The next meeting of the Yuan should be January 4th, but it was resolved to postpone it by one week to the 11th. Also, the issue of improving the method of storing and exchanging gold and silver in Li's proposal at today's meeting was submitted to the Financial Committee of the Yuan for discussion.</p>
<h3>The Executive Yuan's Policy Guidelines: Will Not Be Submitted to the Legislative Yuan for Reporting for the Time Being</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Nanjing, 29th] The Executive Yuan's policy guidelines have been decided not to be submitted to the Legislative Yuan for reporting for the time being. After discussion at the political affairs meeting on the 29th, it was believed that the guidelines of various ministries and commissions were not yet complete, and it would not be appropriate to submit them hastily, so it was decided not to submit them for the time being.</p>
<h3>Lu Han Arrives in Shanghai Upon Summons: Scheduled to Go to Beijing This Morning to Report on His Duties; Long Yun Rests Quietly in Hong Kong and Does Not Discuss National Affairs</h3>

It is reported that Lu is scheduled to go to Beijing on the morning of the 30th and will return to Kunming a week later.</p>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Kunming, 29th] Since Long Yun, the former Chairman of Yunnan, went to Hong Kong from Beijing to recuperate, there have been many rumors here. According to An Enpu, a Yunnanese legislator who recently returned from Hong Kong and had a long conversation with Long, Long is still resting quietly in Hong Kong and does not discuss national affairs. All the rumors are false. After he recovers, he will return to Beijing to request for a leave of absence to be terminated, and will not return to Yunnan for the time being.</p>
<h3>Gui Yongqing Returns to Beijing: Reports That the Defense of the Yangtze River Is Tight</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 29th] General Gui Yongqing, Commander-in-Chief of the Navy, inspected the Yangtze River defense by ship some days ago to strengthen it. He went ashore to inspect the garrisons at places such as Dongxiliangshan, Wuhu, and Digang, convened commanders of the garrisons and fleet commanders patrolling those areas, and gave detailed instructions on the defense deployment and coordination between the army and navy. He returned to Beijing yesterday morning after completing his official duties.

<h3>Economic and Military Aid Supplies: The United States Continues to Deliver to China; Considers the CCP's Accusation of War Criminals Inconceivable; Lovett Issues Statement in Washington</h3>
<p>[News Report] Washington, 29th (Broadcast): Acting Secretary of State Lovett stated that the U.S. State Department is extremely concerned about the CCP's accusation of the leaders of the National Government as war criminals. Lovett also revealed that Madame Chiang Kai-shek had met with him at the State Department on the 27th to request the United States to increase aid to China. However, he refused to announce his reply to Madame Chiang Kai-shek. Lovett stated that the leaders of the Chinese government being accused of being war criminals by the Communist Party is truly inconceivable to the American people. Lovett stated that he did not believe that this accusation represented the opinions of the Chinese people or other governments. Regarding the meeting between Madame Chiang Kai-shek and himself, Lovett stated that Madame Chiang Kai-shek was merely reiterating her requests to President Truman and Secretary of State Marshall. Regarding the news circulating in China that efforts are being made to achieve a ceasefire, Lovett stated that he had not heard of it and said that it was just one of many rumors. Lovett also stated that the United States is continuing to deliver economic and military aid supplies to the Chinese government in accordance with the original procedures.</p>

<h3>The Exchange of Gold and Silver Will Be Resumed: The Banks Will Continue to Handle the Exchange When They Reopen on January 5th, and a Balancing Fee Will Be Added to the Original Funds</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Nanking, 29th] The method of exchanging gold and silver for gold yuan coupons, which has been suspended for nearly a week, was resolved to be resumed at the political affairs meeting on the 29th. It was also resolved that the exchange work will continue when the banks reopen on January 5th next year. However, as the price difference between the black market price of gold and silver and the amount of the exchange is too large, and it is not in line with the price of foreign exchange transfer certificates, it was resolved at the meeting that when the exchange is resumed, a balancing fee will be added to the original funds for the exchange. The price of the balancing fee will be quoted by the Central Bank. The calculation is based on the exchange rate difference between the Central Bank's overseas remittances on that day, calculated at a ratio of 50 US dollars to one tael of gold. The difference in the price of gold is the figure for the balancing fee. When this new method is implemented, the regulation that each person is allowed to exchange one tael of gold or 49 silver dollars every three months with an ID card will remain unchanged. At the political affairs meeting on the 29th, the political commissioners discussed this new method for a long time and decided that in order to thoroughly improve the exchange method and stabilize the overall price surge, the Ministry of Finance should jointly formulate a thorough fundamental method with the Central Bank. This method of charging a balancing fee is still a transitional measure, and the transitional method should continue to be improved after the fundamental method is formulated.</p>

<h3>Foreign Reporter Proves Soviet Aid to the CCP</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Peiping Correspondent, Jion, 29th] There is now a constant stream of evidence proving that the Soviet Union has gradually crossed the line of neutrality and is providing the Communist Party in the Northeast with opinions and aid. According to conversations with reporters returning from the Communist army lines last week, it can be confirmed that the Nanjing government spokesman's announcement on the evening of the 28th that Soviets were appearing in the Northeast was true. At the very least, the Soviets were providing technical assistance to the Communist side. Some time ago, reports were heard here that Soviet aircraft from the Lushun and Dalian bases were flying over the Shandong Peninsula and the National Army's area. The reporter overheard a conversation between two Communist political workers and obtained definite proof of the Soviets' presence in the Northeast. According to one of them, Soviet railway technicians had assisted the CCP in repairing the railways in the areas occupied by the CCP. The Communist Party member apparently did not notice that the reporter could understand part of their conversation.</p>
<p>Regarding the fact that non-Chinese Communist Party members are also serving in the Communist army, the reporter can prove that there are Koreans and Japanese serving in the joint affairs of the Communist army near Peiping.</p>
<p>Liu Shaoqi, a member of the CCP Central Committee, recently broadcasted a message, which is another proof of the closer ties between the Chinese and Soviet Communist Parties. Liu emphasized that the Chinese Communist Party is part of the world revolutionary movement. Liu also attacked the nationalistic ideas of Yugoslav Prime Minister Tito and condemned Tito for failing to understand the planned world of communism.</p>

<h3>Trends in the Japanese General Election</h3>
<p>After the Japanese Parliament announced its dissolution on the 23rd, the government officially announced on the 27th that the nationwide general election in Japan would be held on January 23rd of next year. Currently, various political parties have started the candidate registration process on the 27th, and are putting forward attractive policies, preparing for various campaign arrangements before the election vote. The political parties participating in the next new parliamentary election include the Democratic Liberal Party, the Democratic Party, the Socialist Party, the Cooperative Party, and the Communist Party. Among the activities of various political parties, the Democratic Liberal Party led by Prime Minister Yoshida occupies the most advantageous position. General observation believes that the Democratic Liberal Party and its conservative forces may win the next general election, and the future regime will still belong to the conservative forces, or even tend to be more right-wing and conservative. Regarding the upcoming Japanese general election, we are unwilling to hastily make a judgment on the victory of any party or faction. We must point out how Japan's disguised democracy is flourishing and developing today, as well as its future trends.</p>
<p>The Japanese Parliament is divided into central and local levels. The assemblies of each prefecture are local parliamentary organizations. The central parliament is divided into the House of Councillors and the House of Representatives, which are constitutionally called the Diet. The majority of seats in the House of Representatives belongs to the first party, and the cabinet is responsible for organizing it. In practice, the cabinet mostly appears as a coalition government, and a one-party government does not violate the constitution. After the general election in April last year, the Socialist Party held the position of the first party in the House of Representatives. Later, due to the internal divisions of the Socialist and Democratic parties, the Democratic Liberal Party's camp was strengthened, and the Democratic Liberal Party jumped to become the first party in the House of Representatives. The Socialist Party was reduced to the second party, and the Democratic Party remained the third party. Other parties, such as the Cooperative Party and the Communist Party, are all minority parties in the House of Representatives, and their movements do not affect the political situation. The Democratic Liberal Party, the Socialist Party, and the Democratic Party are still more capable of dominating the political situation. Therefore, the movements of the three parties can be used as an explanation of the overall political situation.</p>
<p>There are a total of 466 seats in the House of Representatives. The number of candidates nominated by each party has now exceeded 2,000, especially the Democratic Liberal Party, which has nominated the most, with a total of 320 candidates. It hopes that at least 80% of them can be elected, occupying more than half of the total number of members of the House of Representatives, so as to facilitate the organization of a strong and unified conservative cabinet after the general election. The party's Secretary-General, Hirokawa, confidently said: I firmly believe that at least 250 of the 300 candidates of the Democratic Liberal Party will be elected. If the Democratic Liberal Party also occupies an advantageous position in the new parliament, the Democratic Party will support it. On the day Yoshida announced the general election period, he said very self-assuredly: In the future general election, the Democratic Liberal Party has complete confidence in winning. The government must take some measures to prevent the Communist Party from gaining an important position and destroying MacArthur's recovery plan. Secondly, the Democratic Party nominated 150 candidates, hoping to win 130 seats with the support of Yoshida. Due to the Showa, Charcoal Pipe, and Fiber three major corruption cases, the Democratic Party, like the Socialist Party, has completely lost the people's faith. Whether it can obtain ideal seats in the future depends on the relationship between the party's new president, Inukai Ken, and the Democratic Liberal Party, and on the voters' choice. The next is the Socialist Party. The party has been swaying from side to side, and its credibility has been declining in recent years. It has now nominated 167 candidates. The party's election countermeasures headquarters estimates very uncertainly that 120 people may be elected in the future. In severe cases, it will be about 90 people. Other small parties, such as the Cooperative Party and the Communist Party, have increased their candidate nominations compared to the previous election. The Cooperative Party occupies 29 seats in the House of Representatives and has now nominated 100 candidates. The Communist Party occupies 4 seats in the House of Representatives and has also nominated 100 people. This shows that the status of small parties in this general election cannot be ignored.</p>
<p>Based on the above analysis, we can point out the trends of this Japanese general election: (1) The conservative forces of the Democratic Liberal Party and the Democratic Party may win the general election, and the Democratic Liberal Party will steadily take the position of the first party in the House of Representatives. MacArthur's directive to accelerate Japan's economic recovery and the Christmas amnesty for 17 Japanese war criminals are clear proofs that provide significant encouragement to the conservative forces, increasing the competitiveness of the Democratic Liberal and Democratic parties; (2) If the Socialist Party does not have a left-wing coalition, it may collapse and fall behind the Democratic Party. The Cooperative and Communist parties, as they are not involved in corruption cases, may have many more votes, but they will not have a decisive or dominant force in the future parliament. In short, the general trend of the future Japanese political situation belongs to the conservative forces, and the policy is increasingly moving towards the right, inevitably gradually reviving the military system, and the trend is very clear.</p>

<h3>Suzhou and Wuxi Prices Rise and Fall Sharply</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Wuxi, 29th] The market conditions for various goods today rose sharply and fell sharply. The dramatic fluctuation is unprecedented.

<h3>New Deployments of US Forces in the Far East: The 7th Infantry Division of South Korea Withdraws to Japan, and the 11th Air Transport Division Stationed in Japan is Ordered to Return to the United States. General-Rank Military Officers Under MacArthur are Replaced, and Military Strength is Reduced.</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 29th] According to a statement by the US Army Department today: The technical forces of the US military in the Far East will undergo a general adjustment. The 11th Air Transport Division, which was the first to enter Japan, will be ordered to return to the United States and will be replaced by the US infantry withdrawn from South Korea. The redistribution of military strength in Japan may reduce the military strength under MacArthur's command, as the entire 7th Division will not be withdrawn from South Korea to Japan. (An authoritative source told reporters: US troops will still have some presence in South Korea.) Since the 11th Division is the only air transport force of the United States in Japan, the division's return to the country will leave MacArthur without an air transport force. The Army Department previously announced that several general-rank officers, including MacArthur's chief of staff, will be summoned back to the country, and there will be other appointments. This policy will affect all general-rank officers under MacArthur's command. The adjustment of the army and the replacement of general-rank officers will reduce the military strength under MacArthur's command and take away some commanders he trusts very much.</p>
<p>[US Information Service, Washington, 28th] The US Army today announced plans to withdraw a portion of US troops stationed in Korea. This move by the US military is in accordance with the recent resolution of the United Nations General Assembly. According to the resolution, the occupying forces in Korea should be withdrawn as soon as possible and early.</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 28th] The total number of US troops stationed in Korea has not been officially announced recently. It is only known that it was about 30,000 in May last year. The 7th Division has 15,000 troops, so the withdrawal of the division is equivalent to reducing the number of troops stationed in South Korea by half. The Soviet occupying forces in North Korea have also begun to withdraw successively. The Soviet side announced that the withdrawal began in September and will be completed before January 1, 1949. The number of Soviet troops in North Korea is much larger than that of US troops in South Korea. In addition, North Korea has 200,000 police officers trained and equipped by the Soviet Union. The South Korean security force trained by the US military has at most 60,000 troops.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Tokyo, 29th] MacArthur's headquarters issued a communique today stating that the US occupation forces in South Korea have now begun to withdraw. It also stated that the withdrawal was realized after the establishment of the Republic of Korea and the United Nations decided to order the United States and the Soviet Union to withdraw their troops as soon as possible. The withdrawing US troops will be transferred to Japan to replace a certain unit that has already been transported back to the country by transport plane.</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 28th] According to reliable sources, the United States will formally recognize the South Korean government after January 1 and will simultaneously appoint President's Special Envoy Mu Xie'ao as the first US ambassador to Korea. The candidate for the Korean ambassador to the United States has not yet been announced. Although the withdrawal of the US occupation forces from Korea is being carried out according to plan, it does not mean that all US troops will be withdrawn. The remaining troops are expected to be combat troops.</p>
<p>[United Press, Seoul, 29th] Korean President Lee Seung-man declared today that although some US troops have withdrawn, South Korea's national defense is still very secure. I believe that our national defense forces will soon be able to do without large-scale external forces. US President's Representative to Korea Mu Xie'ao visited Lee today with Commander Corde of the 24th Army. According to Mu, Washington has not yet notified the exact date for the United States to formally recognize the Korean government, but it should be within a few days.</p>
<h3>Security Council Passes British Proposal: Order Immediate Ceasefire Between Arabs and Jews; Armies Should Retreat to Original Positions; Consider Sanctions for Violations; British Statement Indicates No Intention to Invoke Anglo-Egyptian Treaty</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] Paris, 29th Broadcast: During the Security Council's discussion of the Holy Land issue today, British representative Bailey declared that he had received a report from the British Embassy in Egypt stating that Jewish forces had invaded Egyptian territory by approximately 30 miles, and heavy fighting had been ongoing for several days. The Security Council, considering that this action might involve the Anglo-Egyptian Treaty of 1936, which stipulates that if one party is invaded, the other should provide "immediate" assistance, led to a tense atmosphere in the meeting.</p>
<p>The Council immediately passed the British proposal with eight votes, ordering an immediate ceasefire in Palestine, with both sides' armies retreating to their original positions and immediately commencing ceasefire negotiations. The resolution also stipulated that the Palestine Committee should continue its meeting at Lake Success on January 7th and submit a report on whether both Egypt and the Jewish side have complied with the ceasefire order. If neither side is willing to cease fire, the Security Council will consider sanctions based on previous resolutions. The Security Council also passed a French amendment, ordering both Egypt and the Jewish side to accept UN observers to monitor the ceasefire situation on the ground. The three countries abstaining today were the United States, the Soviet Union, and Ukraine. The U.S. representative stated that he had not received instructions from Washington, while the Soviet representative voted in favor of the ceasefire order. Also, a London dispatch reported that a British Foreign Office spokesman stated that although Jewish forces had invaded Egypt, Britain currently has no intention of invoking the Anglo-Egyptian Treaty.</p>

<h3>Chiang Chia-tung Returns to Batavia</h3>
<p>Mediation Committee Asks Consular Corps in the Dutch East Indies</p>
<p>To Submit Report on Military Situation in Indonesia</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Batavia, 28th Dispatch] Our Consul-General in Batavia, Chiang Chia-tung, returned here today from Yogyakarta. While in Yogyakarta, he received a report on the situation of overseas Chinese in the region after the Dutch military action.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Batavia, 29th Dispatch] The United Nations Mediation Committee delivered a copy of the Security Council resolution to the Chinese Consul-General, Wan Chia, ordering the previously established Consular Corps to report to the Security Council on the military situation in Indonesia. Chiang stated that he hoped the five-nation Consular Corps could meet on the 30th to discuss plans. U.S. Consul-General Livingston stated that he had not yet received instructions from Washington or the United Nations regarding the new resolution. A spokesperson for the Consular Corps stated that Chiang, as the head of the Corps, was given a full copy of the resolution.</p>
<h3>Release Indonesian Leaders; Implement Ceasefire; Dutch Response is Ambiguous; U.S. and Soviet Representatives to the Security Council Express Dissatisfaction</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] Paris, 29th Broadcast: Dutch representative Van Royen told the Security Council that the Netherlands would cease combat operations in Java no later than midnight on the 31st. However, he said that the fighting in Sumatra would not end until two or three days later due to the special circumstances there. Van Royen also said that Indonesian political prisoners would be released at the same time, but that the prisoners must cease all activities that could endanger public safety. Dutch Prime Minister Drees will travel to Indonesia in the next few days to assist in the task of rebuilding Indonesia.</p>
<p>Van Royen stated that the Dutch government would provide various conveniences to United Nations military observers and members of the United Nations Consular Commission so that they could compile the report required by the Security Council. British representative Farra stated that the Netherlands had somewhat met the wishes of the Security Council, but the extent to which they have done so would not be clear until early January. Soviet and U.S. representatives expressed dissatisfaction with the Dutch response. U.S. representative Jessup pointed out that the resolution passed on the 25th included two points: a ceasefire and the release of political prisoners. "The Netherlands' statement does not inform us that either of these points has been complied with." However, Jessup continued, "There is no need to propose a resolution regarding the Netherlands' non-compliance." Soviet representative Malik stated that the Netherlands dared to give such a response because they had high-level protectors on the Security Council to shield them. The refusal of Britain and the U.S. to vote for the withdrawal of Dutch troops was effectively encouraging aggressors and emboldening them to give today's response. Malik accused the British delegation of having made every effort to prevent effective action from being taken against the aggressors.</p>

<p>[Associated Press, Cairo, 29th Dispatch] Following the assassination of Egyptian Prime Minister Nokrashy, Abdel Hadi has been appointed as the new Prime Minister. The only major change in the cabinet is the resignation of Foreign Minister Khashaba, who has been replaced by Minister of Transportation Abbasa.

In attendance were Speaker Pan Gongzhan, Deputy Speaker Xu Jiyu, and a total of 129 Municipal Councilors. Also present were Mayor Wu and over thirty heads of various bureaus and departments. After the Speaker announced the opening of the meeting, the Council Secretariat first gave its report.

With the exception of Social Affairs Bureau Director Wu Kaixian, who was absent due to illness and unable to answer, the inquiries to the other bureaus were answered by the bureau directors in turn. The Councilors' inquiries to the various bureaus were not particularly enthusiastic yesterday, and the entire inquiry process concluded in just over an hour. At around 5:00 PM, the Speaker announced a ten-minute recess, after which the meeting continued. Two provisional motions were passed: (1) Mayor's temporary proposal: Zhang Hanting, captain of the Jinyuanli motorized junk, risked his life to save people, showing great benevolence and righteousness, admired by the entire nation. It is proposed that he be awarded the Honorary Citizen Medal to show respect and encourage moral behavior. Please review this proposal.

The inquiries to the various bureaus and their responses are recorded below:</p>
<p>Inquiries to and Responses from the Civil Affairs Bureau: (1) Tong Xiang: Why is the organization and training of the People's Self-Defense Force not being actively pursued? Why is the source of those spreading rumors not being investigated? (2) Zhang Zhihan: Garrison troops in the suburbs are forcing villagers to provide food, which local people cannot afford. The Civil Affairs Bureau should find a solution. (3) Chen Peide: Regarding the issue of local garrison troops harassing the people, the Civil Affairs Bureau should present the matter to Mayor Wu and Garrison Commander Chen of the Garrison Headquarters to discuss a solution.</p>
<p>Director Zhang of the Civil Affairs Bureau responded: (1) The People's Self-Defense Force is experiencing financial difficulties, so its establishment is delayed. Allocating funds earlier in the next year will allow it to be established sooner. (2) Regarding the case of garrison troops requiring local food supplies mentioned by Councilors Zhang and Chen, the bureau will ask the city government to consult with the Garrison Headquarters and the Ministry of National Defense to improve soldiers' salaries and issue in-kind provisions to reduce the people's burden.</p>
<h3>Land Registration Welcomes "Number Calling"; Director Zhu Declares Efficiency Not Low</h3>
<p>Inquiries to and Responses from the Land Administration Bureau: (1) Zhu Shujian: Land registration at the Land Administration Bureau is slow, and there is a "number calling" situation involving the director and section chiefs. Why is this not being improved? (2) Qu Yue: Why is land registration in the Yangjing district delayed? (3) Huang Zhensheng: The stall base of the Yuwei Peddlers' Association has been occupied. Why did the Land Administration Bureau assist the old calico guild in forcibly occupying the stall base and issue a land registration certificate?</p>
<p>Director Zhu Ping of the Land Administration Bureau responded: (1) The Land Administration Bureau does indeed have a "number calling" situation. This is done by publishing notices in newspapers for citizens to expedite the process, and we welcome citizens to "call numbers" publicly in the future. (2) Land registration in the Yangjing district is actively underway. I have handled 130,000 land registrations in Shanghai in the past three years, and I believe my work efficiency is not low. (3) The dispute over the stall base of the Yuwei Peddlers' Association is an old case from before the war. The former Finance Bureau and Land Administration Bureau have both issued certificates. This case will be investigated and handled after consulting with Director Tian.</p>
<h3>Militiaman Who Beat Refugee to Death Has Been Sent to Court for Prosecution</h3>

(3) Zhuzhai Town is very close to the Xin'an branch, and there have been no major cases in the past. Local security can be absolutely guaranteed.</p>
<h3>Education Budget for Next Year Estimated at Over 70 Million</h3>
<p>Inquiries to and Responses from the Education Bureau: (1) Zhang Zhongyuan: Jiandong Elementary School on Tangshan Road has become completely commercialized. The principal disregards education and specializes in business, and the director of studies, Zhang Yiwu, monopolizes power, embezzling the teachers' respect-teacher bonuses and the school staff's living allowances. Why is the Education Bureau not thoroughly investigating? (2) Qu : Xinlu Normal School buildings are damaged. Why has the Education Bureau not repaired them? (3) Zhao Yangxiong: How much is the city's education budget for next year, and does it meet constitutional standards?</p>
<p>Director Li Ximou of the Education Bureau responded: (1) I believe it is true that Jiandong Elementary School has embezzled teachers' respect-teacher bonuses and school staff's living allowances. I have also received reports of similar cases at Minde Girls' High School and Zhaoguang Middle School in the city. These cases will be thoroughly investigated and severely dealt with. (2) The funds for repairing the Xinlu Normal School buildings have finally been received and will be repaired next year. (3) The city's education budget for next year is estimated at 77,242,599 gold yuan, accounting for 20 percent, which is not up to the constitutional standard of 35 percent. However, the city government's finances are extremely difficult, so it is difficult to make a rigid stipulation. We will try to increase it as much as possible within the possible range.</p>
<h3>Garbage Piles Up in Alleys; Health Bureau Promises to Find a Solution</h3>

The curfew hours are hindering garbage collection, and garbage trucks are damaged and cannot be repaired due to lack of funds. We will find ways to step up our efforts in the future to maintain the cleanliness of the alleys.</p>
<p>Inquiries to and Responses from the Social Affairs Bureau: Tong Xiang: The "Rice-for-Cloth" case has been reported in the newspapers for a long time. What is the truth, and how should this case be handled? Please respond, Director of the Social Affairs Bureau.</p>

<h3>Business of Four Major Department Stores Increases One to Four Times; Customers Mostly Transient Travelers; Ordinary Citizens Hesitant Due to Prices</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] Amidst the recent fluctuations in prices, reporters inquired yesterday about the recent business conditions from the authorities of the four major department stores on Nanjing Road. The responses received, while not without discrepancies, generally showed an increase in turnover. On average, the increase was from one to four times compared to a week ago. Daily turnover ranged from 300,000 to 400,000 yuan to over 1 million yuan. It was said that business in department stores generally increases around Christmas and New Year's, but this year, the new wave of price increases has coincided with the influx of floating capital from the north, so the increase in turnover is indeed higher than in previous years at this time. It has been observed that many of the customers in department stores in recent days are transient travelers and soldiers from the north, and ordinary citizens, frequently affected by the price increases, are spending their remaining funds to purchase urgently needed daily necessities, but their numbers are still not many. Therefore, the frantic buying spree that occurred during the post-August 19th period has not yet been repeated. Reporters visited the major department stores yesterday and found more customers browsing than buying. The prices of most of the goods displayed in the windows have increased by 50% to 120% compared to before Christmas. However, the department store authorities do not feel interested in the price increases and increased turnover. They believe that retail stores are the first to be hit by each consecutive surge in prices. Wholesale prices can change several times a day, and can even be suspended at any time during sudden increases, but retail prices can only change once a day at most, and once prices are set, they must supply as much as possible with their existing inventory. Therefore, retail goods are in danger of being bought up when wholesale prices soar and are disconnected from retail prices. For example, the wholesale price of general cotton textiles has recently increased threefold, while the retail price in department stores has only increased by 50%. As a result, the department stores are taking a significant loss. It is also rumored that the major department stores are only selling their existing inventory and remitting the proceeds south as much as possible without approving new goods. The department store authorities have denied this.

<h3>The Fishing Vessel "Yukan" Lost and Sunk - Report of the Fisheries Administration on the Course of Events</h3>
<p>[Report from our Newspaper] Chief Captain Si Songsheng and Deputy Chief Captain Liu Jingying of the Fisheries Administration hosted reporters at the Jinmen Hotel yesterday regarding the sinking of the fishing vessel "Yukan," reporting the true details of the accident and the rescue efforts. Foreign consultants Davis, Eklo, and Henkey, among others, also attended the report. Based on their combined analysis, they all believe that the "Yukan" accident was due to an unavoidable, unexpected invasion. Eklo, a highly experienced expert, believes that the loss of the vessel may have been due to damage to the fish hold door caused by the impact of water, leading to sinking, as he had learned that such a hatch board had been discovered floating near the sea area where the incident occurred. According to Chief Captain Si Songsheng of the Fisheries Administration, Davis, who has decades of navigation experience, also believes that the vessel's loss may have been due to water entering the hold after encountering a storm. Chief Captain Si emphasized that since the establishment of the Fisheries Administration, it has hired many foreign experts specifically for guidance and planning in order to expand its operations. The management and equipment of the fishing vessels have been very appropriate and careful, with no negligence or carelessness. Mr. Si also released a written report, first stating that after the "Yukan" collided with the "Yuxin" on October 15th, the bow of the "Yukan" was damaged, and it returned to Shenjiamen for repairs. It continued fishing on the 22nd and returned to Shanghai on the 27th. After inspection by the marine engineer and technicians from the repair shop, they ordered repairs. The "Yukan" went out fishing on November 2nd. At that time, there was no refusal to repair or forced fishing trip. On November 25th, the "Yukan" returned to Shanghai safely. According to the repair shop, the "Yukan" requested four repairs on the 25th and another three repairs on December 1st, all of which were completed in a timely manner. However, none of the seven items were major repairs, and the "Yukan" went out fishing again on December 2nd.</p>
<p>The report then described the search after the accident. It was reported that after the "Yukan" accident, the Fisheries Administration's fishing vessels stopped fishing and all participated in the search, which lasted for more than ten days. Their only hope was to find all the crew members of the "Yukan." To date, there are still people assigned to various islands and the sea area of the accident to continue the search, hoping to be worthy of the crew members and their families. As for the compensation, the administration will definitely provide it preferentially.</p>
<p>Requests for Repairs Completed in a Timely Manner, Search and Rescue Extended for More Than Ten Days</p>

<h3>Procedures for Exchange of Gold Change Again - Employees of Eight Units Disappointed, Ready to Deposit Funds but No Result</h3>
<p>[Report from our Newspaper] A humorous episode occurred regarding the application for gold exchange by civil servants and teachers, namely that eight state-owned enterprises in this city, because they were not included in the list of civil servants for gold exchange, petitioned the Central Bank ten times. When their representatives negotiated with the Central Bank the day before yesterday, Liu Gongyun agreed to allocate 5,000 taels of gold, which would be uniformly distributed among the 17,000 employees of the eight units. At that time, most of the petitioning representatives advocated for distribution based on the unit, with equal distribution. However, the representatives of the two railway bureaus believed that the bureau had as many as 9,000 people, and if the distribution standard was based on the group, it would be unfair, so they did not agree. When the representatives went to the Central Bank again yesterday afternoon, the representatives of the railway bureau had complied with the majority. However, good things often take twists and turns. The new gold exchange procedures were passed in the afternoon, with a balancing fee to be collected in addition to the official price of gold and silver. As a result, the Central Bank stated that it must be handled in accordance with the new procedures. The representatives insisted on refusing and, with cash in hand, waited in the Central Bank conference room demanding that they be allowed to exchange at the original price. Since they still did not get their way, they left around 6 p.m. It is reported that they will continue to petition until they achieve their goal.</p>

<h3>Transshipment Restrictions Will Be Relaxed for Goods Actually Needed in Various Places - Import Quotas for Guangzhou and Taiwan Will Be Appropriately Increased Next Season</h3>
<p>According to the Export-Import Control Committee, the general quotas for the seventh and eighth seasons have already been fully allocated. The average monthly amount of import permits issued is approximately US$5 million. However, the industrial quotas have not been fully allocated due to the failure of various manufacturers to submit the lists of quota users of their respective trade unions to the Export-Import Control Committee. It is expected that the import quotas for the ninth and tenth seasons will not be much more than the total amount of quotas allocated to various ports in the past. Because trade linkage is now being implemented, it is necessary to consider the export situation on the one hand and the amount of national foreign exchange reserves on the other hand, taking everything into account. As for the increase or decrease in the quotas for various ports, Guangzhou and Taiwan will be appropriately increased, while the north will be reduced. However, the current situation is constantly changing, and the quotas allocated to various ports in the future may not meet actual needs. Therefore, transshipment restrictions will be relaxed so that they can be adjusted to each other.</p>
<h3>Unusual Price Firmness - Rice Prices Rise More Sharply - Nanshi Market's Thin Rice Breaks Through 700 Yuan Barrier</h3>
<p>Rice prices are rising more sharply. Because the price increases of other commodities are more severe than those in the rice market, and the prices in the producing area of Wuxi are close to those in Shanghai, the price firmness is unusual. The Nanshi market opened with a 100 yuan increase. Although it fell slightly in the middle of the day, it rose sharply again before closing. Thin rice has broken through the 700 yuan barrier, reaching 710 yuan, a sharp increase of 170 yuan. Special high-grade glutinous rice and Yinbaiyuan have also exceeded 700 yuan. Early white glutinous rice opened at 690 yuan, each rising by 150-160 yuan. The market continued to shout higher at closing. The increase in the Beishi market was smaller, with glutinous rice and thin rice each rising by 130 yuan. The arrival of goods yesterday was 11,263 stone.</p>
<p>Flour</p>
<p>Sharp rise continues. Yesterday's rise was even more severe. Upon hearing that rice prices were rising, the goods owners tried their best to support the prices. Old Che flour reached 350 yuan as soon as it opened, and then rose to 360 yuan. It closed at 359 yuan, a sharp increase of 96 yuan, a huge 40% increase. Bingchuan flour closed at 355 yuan, also sharply rising 96 yuan. Red Bee and Jiancheng each rose sharply by about 40%. Miscellaneous brands of flour all rose by 80-90 yuan. Bran also rose sharply, with large bags of bran rising 62 yuan.</p>
<p>Miscellaneous Grains</p>
<p>The rise is in full swing. Initially, due to the rise in rice prices, people were optimistic, and it was difficult for goods owners to quote prices. Trading opened late, and the price increase was alarming. Hankou Zhadou reached a high price of 550 yuan, a sharp increase of 230 yuan, more than 70%. Corn was absorbed by the Qing Gang, and the goods owners tried their best to support the price. Huangdu corn reached 550 yuan, a 200 yuan increase. Red grain rose by 120 yuan. Jian Qing and Yuanmai all rose by 40-50%. Mung beans jumped even more severely. Mao mung beans opened at 700 yuan, almost doubling. Sesame rose by 400 yuan, and white sesame exceeded 1,000 yuan. Raw peanuts first rose and then fell, ultimately rising by 200-300 yuan.</p>
<p>Cooking Oil</p>
<p>Sharp rise and rapid fall, dangerous turmoil, hot speculation, with a range of 800 yuan. No one was selling at the opening, and no buyer at the closing. Soybean oil reached a maximum of 3,300 yuan, and rapeseed oil reached a maximum of 3,200 yuan. Later, Tian factories opened in large quantities, and the prices of non-industry commodities fell, causing a rapid decline of 700-800 yuan. Soybean oil closed at 2,550 yuan, rapeseed oil closed at 2,450 yuan, and Jiton rapeseed oil closed at 2,600 yuan, each rising by 200 yuan.

<p>According to financial authorities, the amount of floating funds circulating in the city is estimated to be more than one billion yuan, and funds from various places have continued to flow in recently. They pointed out that the source of these funds is not only North China, but also funds from South China, Hong Kong, and Guangzhou have recently flowed back to Shanghai in large quantities. The reason for this is that commodity prices in the city were stable in the previous period. They also hinted that the authorities may consider limiting remittances to Shanghai in order to control this flood. In the current situation, relying solely on the sale of materials is not enough to achieve the immediate effect of tightening the money supply. For example, on the 28th, the currency recovered by the government from the sale of yarn and cloth was approximately 38 million yuan, while the floating funds concentrated in the market exceeded 400 million.</p>
<h3>Various Businesses Should Apply for and Transfer Increased Capital in Cash on Schedule</h3>
<p>The total amount to be transferred is approximately 7,500,000 Yuan</p>
<p>Regarding the increased capital of commercial businesses, the issue of cash transfer is still in a state of high importance. As of yesterday morning, the Central Bank had not yet received any transfer applications from businesses. According to bank personnel, if businesses fail to apply for transfer by the 31st, and the Ministry of Finance does not issue any extensions or alternative measures, the financial regulatory authorities have the right to revoke their business licenses based on the announced regulations. However, they believe that although the time is very tight, this issue will surely be resolved before the deadline.</p>
<p>Furthermore, according to estimates from the National Bank, the total amount of cash to be transferred for the increased capital of commercial businesses in this city is approximately 7.5 million Yuan.</p>
<h3>Foreign Exchange Certificate Prices Soar</h3>
<p>The exchange rate for overseas remittances was raised for the twelfth time yesterday, reaching 100 Gold Yuan per US dollar, an increase of eight Yuan compared to the previous rate. The foreign exchange transfer certificate opened sharply in the morning, surging to 128 to 129 Yuan. Later, upon hearing that the black market price of gold banknotes had jumped, various groups vigorously competed to buy, and the price rose again to 130 Yuan. Subsequently, exporters took profits at the high price, and the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications secretly sold off large quantities, causing the price to trend downward. At the close of the market, the transaction price for designated banks was 115 Yuan for buying and 116 Yuan for selling.</p>
<h3>Tea Market Permeated with Buying Sentiment</h3>
<p>The tea market opened yesterday with reports of sharp price increases for goods outside the industry, stirring up sentiment. Holders of goods, fearing they would not be able to replenish their stock once sold, were reluctant to part with them, leading to a situation of demand exceeding supply and few transactions. Prices rose in a straight line. Subsequently, as prices for various goods outside the industry uniformly declined, holders became slightly more willing to sell red and green tea, and the volume of transactions gradually increased. However, domestic sales of fancy teas continued to be dominated by buying sentiment, with transactions being particularly active in this street and elsewhere. As for export case tea, the shipping schedule was still far off, and exporters remained relatively inactive, with only sporadic transactions.</p>
<h3>Sugar Prices Skyrocket</h3>
<p>The sugar market continued to rise yesterday. Despite the strong upward trend in recent days, sentiment remained strong. The opening trend for various firms was relatively stable, but upon hearing that prices for various goods outside the industry had risen again, spreading bullish sentiment, local firms took the lead in adding to their holdings, driving up prices. The market shifted from stability to strength, with more demand than supply, leading to chaotic price increases.</p>
<p>No. 45 grade white refined sugar opened at 1300 Yuan in the morning, and after opening, there was a chorus of buying. Holders pushed prices higher, soaring by 200 Yuan in an instant. Subsequently, prices fluctuated between 1460 Yuan and 1480 Yuan, with few sellers, leading to the close of the market, up 430 Yuan.</p>
<p>Coarse sugar opened at a low price of 960 Yuan and rose all the way, reaching a high of 1380 Yuan at the close. Prices for other types of sugar rose correspondingly, with the exception of Xinghua red sugar, which did not see any transactions.</p>
<h3>Tung Oil Initially Strong, Then Retreated</h3>
<p>Yesterday's tung oil market inherited the continuous upward trend of recent days. Due to the strong position of foreign exchange transfer certificates and the sharp rise in prices for various goods outside the industry, sentiment was remarkably strong, and sellers shouted out prices in leaps and bounds. The market continued its upward trajectory, and prices became even more astonishing. Fully weighted white oil and green oil both reached 1450 Yuan per dan. However, towards noon, the market suddenly became unsustainable and gradually declined, due to tighter credit and a reversal in the prices of various goods. Those who were wary of holding at high prices also began to sell, and the market atmosphere softened. However, prices were still much higher than the previous day's settlement.</p>
<h3>Holders Vigorously Pushing Up Prices, Cotton Cloth Prices Soar in a Straight Line, Dragon Head Fine Cloth Reaches a High of 1350 Yuan</h3>
<p>The rise in cotton yarn prices was like a raging fire. With frequent reports of favorable buying sentiment and a uniform surge in prices for various goods outside the industry, sentiment became increasingly bullish. Retail investors were eagerly buying, and holders vigorously pushed up prices, causing prices to soar in a straight line.</p>
<p>42-count Blue Phoenix opened at 48,300 Yuan in the morning and closed at 40,000 Yuan in the afternoon. 40-count Blue Phoenix rose and then retreated, ultimately closing at 38,500 Yuan, up 3,200 Yuan. 32-count Silver Moon initially opened at a peak of 40,000 Yuan, eventually retreating slightly to 32,000 Yuan, ultimately holding at 000 Yuan.</p>
<p>21-count Double Horse spot goods initially shouted at 32,800 Yuan, reaching a new high of 34,500 Yuan during the day. The market closed at 28,500 Yuan, up 1,100 Yuan. Factory orders were at 27,500 Yuan, also up 1,000 Yuan. 20-count Double Horse fell from 30,000 Yuan to close at 25,500, up 1,200 Yuan. 16-count yarn was transacted outside the 20,000 Yuan mark, and 10-count Boy Scout also broke the 20,000 Yuan barrier.</p>
<p>Yesterday, cotton cloth sparked an astonishing surge. The market was filled with buying orders, and holders refused to sell, leading to chaotic price bidding. Large holders raised prices and absorbed goods. Dragon Head fine cloth broke the 1,000 Yuan mark as soon as it opened, reaching a new high of 1,180 Yuan, causing holders to be unwilling to sell, resulting in a situation of demand exceeding supply. Prices then increased to 1,245 Yuan before some sellers offered a small amount of goods. The price eventually reached a peak of 1,350 Yuan. Before the close, holders took profits by selling, and the price fell back to 1,160 Yuan at the close, resulting in a massive jump of 300 Yuan compared to the previous day. Middle-grade fine cloth was initially transacted at a high of 1,245 Yuan, but there were no transactions after that.</p>
<p>Four Gentlemen Yuan Serge initially opened at 1,100 Yuan. Although it briefly rose to 1,260 Yuan during the day, it ultimately closed at 1,100 Yuan, a surge of 260 Yuan. Four Gentlemen Yuan Zhigong ultimately traded at 1,150 Yuan, a sharp increase of 310 Yuan. In the afternoon, sentiment was reportedly weaker, and various cloths became sluggish.</p>
