<p>〔本報南京八日電〕關於簽署代表之出席大會問題，代表一三三二人之動議，於八日第三次會中提出後，八日晚八時主席團開會時，曾詳加研究，迄九日另時半，始散會。主席團會議由何應欽主持，左舜生，余家菊，孫亞夫等均出席，會中對該案曾作熱烈討論，惟因事關國大選罷法，非國大主席團所能解決，故決交國府，盼能予以合法合理之解決·討論該案時，各委員發言者甚多，于斌。顧毓琇·谷正綱·潘公展·何魯之·孫亞夫等均發言，主席團對絕食代表極表關切，再三硏究，決推五人與國府商一合法合理之解決辦法。于斌等曾提出兩方案，（一）軍人代表百餘名均在前方剿匪，不能出席大會，可即由簽署代表出席遞補，（二）職業代表及婦女代表名額，在憲法中並無規定，其名額係以法律定之，請由大會決議，請立院修改國大組織法，增加職婦代表名額，俾簽署代表得以出席。又簽署代表等八日晚集會，研商出席問題，情緒激昂，將於大會討論該問題時有所表示。又靑年黨要員八日晚亦會商簽署代表問題。</p>

<p>〔本報南京八日電〕孫副主席八日下午六時語本報記者，行憲建國，首須戡亂，共黨叛亂有國際背景，故戡亂必須以景大決心，貫澈到底，共黨如在中國成功，第三次大戰將馬上爆發。記者詢以如我不能解決共黨，是否拖至將來與國際問題同時解決，孫氏謂：不然。渠信目前國際局勢不致迅速發生大戰，而共黨問題則可能迅速單獨解決。孫氏稱：欲完成戡亂，須就軍事。經濟兩者設法改進，如國防部之組織，即有調整必要，惟此問題並不單純。經濟方面，孫氏認爲美援三億三千八百萬元，將使我國月獲近三千萬美元之物資，用以出售，收回法幣，可收减少通貨膨脹，穩定物價之效。</p>
<p>孫氏談及選舉糾紛時稱：依目前情形視之，憲法實施準備程序所定，首届立院於國大閉幕後之第七日自行集會，因立委選舉糾紛現尙未提出謀求解決之道，恐難如期實現。孫氏稱：簽署代表及提名代表要求出席大會，勢將引起名額問題，有人擬將彼等列入職業團體內，似亦未妥，因職業團體國代應由職業團體產生，現此事惟有國大有權決定解決辦法。立委選舉中，因無黨員簽署提名者，故問題較國大簡單，對友黨可能倣國大辦理。孫氏就選舉法立論謂：提名正式與候補者並無差異，均爲介紹性質，結果自當以得票較多者當選，若顧及事實以求調協，則有待中央決定。</p>

<p>本報特寫　（四月八日於南京）</p>
<p>〔本報南京八日電〕超季節的熱浪進　首都，溫度計的水銀柱上升到八十度以上，室外是驕陽逼人，室內窒悶灼熱，像是暴風雨的前夕。</p>
<p>今天的議程是逐條討論大會議事規則，王世杰和張伯苓分担上下午的大會主席。議事規則佈滿了暗礁，才及第一章總則，就觸了礁。有人主張，在國大開會時，得聽取政府施政報吿，檢討國是，並得提出質詢建議，另一位代表却在播音器前送出較微弱的聲浪：「這是屬於代表的職權的，我非常贊同，可是我認爲代表對於憲法應該尊重，如果增加這修正案，就蔣與憲法第廿七條不相符合」。但會衆對此的反應是一片噓聲。接着，自稱受若干代表之託而發言的林紫貴大呼：「照蔣主席昨天對國民黨中執委所提示的內容看來，我們要求政府作施政報吿及對時局檢討，已經獲得了蔣主席的同意；我們要求主席（指大會主席），重視與情」。這一個信號，終被主席的外交手法，不慌不忙的轉移了目標，他說合併到討論第十七條時再討論，可是只求得片刻的寗靜。從第六條到第十六條，一連串無異議通過後，第十七條的討論已來了，這大聲的呼喚說明了他們是爲了爭取「權利」，也就是擴大職權影響到憲法本身的問題，雖然多數人在想如欲修正是否動搖了憲法，可是這種呼喚激動了熱情，於是誰站起來說尊重憲法，誰就不合時宜，誰就是這種衝動情緒下的敵人。有人吐出違憲的陰澀的句子。</p>
<p>下午四時欠五分才宣布開會，僅僅過了十分鐘，風浪便來了，王運明代表跳上發言台，以極鎭定的態度，洪亮的聲浪，悠揚的腔調，呼喚着代表一三三二位連署的代表，爲絕食的簽署代表而呼籲。他說：「這將是比什麼都重要的議題，要求大家注意，絕食代表已經寫好了絕命書，如果眞的絕食而死，不僅是大會的恥辱，也是行憲的汚點，人非木石，孰能無情？請主席接受簽署代表出席大會的動議，即交大會討論」。這動議博得一陣彩聲，此時，主席台的左邊門裏走出來蔣主席，着車便服，輕輕的走到了長官席台上。台下。樓上。樓下一片嘈雜，一片混亂。就在這時，靑年黨代表蔣炳星，因爲想對王運明的話表示意見，奔向發言台，主席說現在停止發言，但沒有效果，余家菊也從後面的播音器裏叫起來：「我們是來行憲的，不是來毀憲的，不能提付討論，主席應負其責」。蔣炳星堅持要說話，張伯苓主席鐵面着臉：「我不許你說話」！老人怒吼了，可是這沒有用。在樓上不斷送來的「人都要餓死了」的呼聲夾着一片喚聲，一片掌聲，一片嗤聲中，陳啓天把蔣炳星勸走，稱是解了圍，風浪慢慢平息。坐在長官席上的蔣主席，在最混亂的當兒，曾經起立，但只兩分鐘就坐下去了，有人說就爲了他站起來，使若干鼓動風浪的人知這了風力方平　下去。</p>
<p>主席張伯苓和秘書長洪蘭友繼續着會議程序討論以次的未完章則，今天的風浪算是過去了。</p>

<p>美國之意願期由大會通過譴責不負責新聞事業的決議案，但問時則不能採納蘇聯，提出的任何意見，免爲蘇聯引以爲宣傳藉口，美國今已發覺起草委員會有採納蘇聯若干意見成立折衷建議的危險，美國失敗之主要原因，在於澳洲之提出長篇修正一案，不啻變更美決議案之措辭，因此使許多代表，認爲該修正案無法與美決議案合併，除非由起草委員會成立折衷建議案。澳洲以及法國，及歐洲大陸若干國，於此成立一致陣綫，主張採用較美決議案更强硬的措辭。關於通訊社的決議案，其中有云，「在本國通訊社尙未發達的國家內，得由其政府支持通訊社，以待此等通訊社之充分長成，外國通訊社尤不得以不公允或不正常的方法，妨碍他國通訊社之發展」。美代表勃朗在蘇聯·墨西哥·菲律賓·烏拉圭之支持下，反對此一決議案，渠認此決議案不啻鼓勵新聞獨佔之設立。至此南斯拉夫代表即抨擊美國之合衆社及美聯社，指爲少數人控制之獨佔事業，如合衆國即係被麥考密克，赫斯特等數人所控制，最後仍以十六對五票，通過美國所反對之決議案</p>

<p>〔聯合社華盛頓七日電〕國會今日接到擴大空軍案兩起，與發徵工業案一起，參院軍委會主席葛奈稱，該會在秘密會議中接到空軍部長薛明頓及空軍高級將領關於擴大戰鬥空軍至七十隊之正式要求。</p>

<p>克里浦斯霍華特系報業聯合會版欋所有　本報編譯室譯　（十三）怒江作戰利害參半</p>
<p>美國對於中國怒江作戰的供應設計，乃是一種悽慘的失敗。該項作戰，係由史迪威將軍的壓力而於一九四四年促成的。</p>
<p>這次作戰的記錄，似乎證實蔣委員長不大願意參加緬甸作戰的這一加添出來的部份，是具有理由的，因爲當時英方已經取消對下緬甸登陸作戰的義務了。在一九四二—三年的冬季中，史迪威曾經估計過怒江遠征軍每月如獲二千噸的空運貨物就可以作戰了，可是幾倘月之後在華盛頓的戰略會議中他却估計怒江部隊需要堆存貨物一萬噸。但是在最後計算起來縱使是這個數字也顯得非常之保守的。</p>
<p>雖然在中國軍隊於一九四四年五月强波怒江之前，負責訓練和配備遠征軍的美國Y部隊已經存在一年以上，可是該項組織却未完成有效的供應計劃　在遠征軍實際開始作戰的大約兩星期之前，沿怒江的陸上供應計劃終被放棄而改取空中補給計劃了。如此，使飛越駝峯的空遝工作，分散得更厲害，結果中國從駝峯而來的貨物，每月减少了一千噸以上。</p>
<p>怒江供應計劃的失敗在一九四四年三月引起了我的注意，當時Y部隊的司令杜恩將軍的一個代表曾經和我商量，問我把駝峯方面的供應品田空中運赴怒江前綫附近地區，是否可取。</p>
<p>他解釋說，供應品是堆存在雲南驛，而Y部隊却缺乏公路運輸工具把供應品向西蓮出。他還說Y部隊的計劃需要牲畜約七千頭把供應品從下車附近運到作戰地帶去；但是所獲得的牲畜不及三千頭。</p>
<p>除了卡車的實際缺乏之外，供應問題並因對於少數的卡車沒有適當的加油設備而成爲更繁雜。因此每一個月，必須從昆明空運五百至一千噸火酒到雲南驛。這種火酒是中國製造的，用以代替較好的燃料。</p>
<p>値得指出的一點，就是燃料突然從昆明區向西移動，實際上幾乎使通往中國東南部空軍基地的本來已經不充份的卡車活動，完全陷於停頓。</p>
<p>雖然屢屢抗議，可是Y部隊對於卡車燃料所享有的優先權，繼續使向東的供應行動削减，致使在日軍的攻勢之前却不得不把空中作戰大事减少，並且在衡陽之戰到達高潮之時，迫使第十四航空隊把轟炸機撤退到後方基地。</p>
<p>由於運輸的牲畜不能應需要而獲得，致使在山中和怒江彼岸的中國軍隊惟有靠空中投擲的方法獲得食物，槍砲和藥彈。在我看來，這種情形顯然爲地上部隊長官的一種錯誤觀念所造成，他們以爲中國人在「囤積」卡車和牲畜。　杜恩始終以爲中國人故意掌握住這些工具不放。他甚至指責中國人把卡車藏起來以供戰後之用，雖然把卡車廠着在整個戰爭期間不用而到以後還是可以應用這一點，是難以設想的。</p>
<p>此外，謹愼的者査並未發現任何被匿藏的卡車，而雲南省當局所說假如提供了所需的七萬頭牲畜的半數就足以使全省不能耕作而陷於饑荒的說法，也沒有方法可以駁倒。　在戰爭期間，批評中國的人把囤積的故事講得如此極端，簡直到可笑的程度。當中國東南部由於美國主張集中力量於緬甸而於一九四四年而告失却之時，桂林警備司令部僅因存有輕砲彈二千發而遭人指爲囤積。</p>
<p>事實上，我們可以對桂林警備司令部最兇的責難，乃是這一點「囤積」，在桂林遭遇到日軍進攻的時候，實在太少了。</p>

<p>（乙）「據上海市渡船業職業公會呈請轉函公用局維持董家渡現有營業請審議案」，決議請公用局酌辦。（丙）改選召集人，仍推汪竹一，姜豪，唐承宗三參議員擔任。（丁）推三召集人參加決議案檢討委員會。（戊）推朱開觀出席公用事業調査委員會案。</p>

<p>民營漁輪業船員罷工僵持不決，昨日爲罷工第四日，鮮魚價已漲三成左右，雖經警備司令部與海員工會繼續調停，但迄晚仍未解決。罷工之漁輪共廿餘艘，船員三百餘人。至出漁歸來之漁輪，是否亦將捲入漩渦，尙屬疑問。漁業界人士對此不辛事件，咸感焦慮，彼等一致指摘漁管處之傾銷及優異之待遇，爲促成罷工之主因。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕據善後事業委員會保管委員會漁管處處長趙君邁昨吿記者稱，該處爲緊縮開支，每月裁减員工，數月來已達四百餘人，本月份又將裁員四十餘人。至外籍職員至本月底爲止，僅留九人，關於外傳漁管處船員待遇特優一點，據記者詢之趙處長稱，捕魚能力最高之船長，其收入相當豐富，確係事實，但僅限於魚季（約二個多月內）。</p>
<p>僅供漁輪　並無薪津</p>
<p>據悉，漁管處船員之待遇制度，自趙氏接任後早已改良，即不給任何薪給或獎金，僅供給漁輪，所有工具如漁網，漁輪用油等，均須船長自備，輪上機件若有損壞，亦須賠償。舉事實爲例，凡一漁輪出外捕魚一次（每次約二三週），須開支約四億元，若得魚僅三萬斤，船長即將虧本。蓋漁管處在該船售魚所得中視成績優劣，須抽取百分之四十至六十之租金·如一船一次售魚後獲利十四億元，除去開支四億，漁管處得六億，船長亦僅剩四億。此四億又須與十餘船員共分，蓋船員亦不取薪津也。目前成績最佳者每次可捕魚十餘萬斤，而每年中有二個月無魚可捕，此時漁夫即一無所得。趙氏繼稱，此種制度一方面可鼓勵船員努力工作，一方面並使渠等愛護公家船隻。</p>
<p>鮮魚製乾　日產萬斤</p>
<p>又該處利用鮮魚製造鹹魚乾工作，業於二週前開始，每日可製成一萬斤，目前正在包紮裝箱中，將來擬運往內地供應。其鮮魚向中國船員購買，每斤一萬五千元。至此項工作尙係初步計劃，以後該處將陸續擴充設備，自製罐頭魚。</p>

<p>昨日米市創新春以來高價，特白粳曾竄出四關，喊價達四〇三萬元，後市以市塲到貨尙衆，客戶趁高略有吐售，價格稍見回挫，收市跌至關邊，爲四〇〇萬元，再軋升十萬元。收市後塲外交易仍在四關一二盤旋。此外上薄做四〇〇萬元，早稻開三九〇萬元，各挺十萬。羊秈市價略平，爲三八〇萬元。白元三九〇萬元，糙粳三四〇萬元。南市塲亦以各方進胃頗濃，初開即飛升達十五萬元，申市以市塲管理委員會有米配出，一度回小五萬元，後市再行升高，與開盤軋平。計白粳薄稻各三九〇萬元。民調會爲供應市塲需要，昨起再分在南北兩市塲隨市價出售，但以北市塲米實銷淸淡，未能售出，僅在南市塲售出三百八十二石五斗。</p>
<p>連日食米價格狂漲，民調會昨特發表聲明如下：社會局民調會爲充實本市糧食存底，恢復戰前本市民食五十萬至一百萬包平均存量，以求長期安定糧價，曾擬定在市塲收市以後，剩餘食米收購辦法，一俟市府通過，即約集有關機關代表商辦，仍以不刺激糧價爲目的。在使運米商人售出以後，再度赴產地購進。該會並分析此次米價之上漲原因，三日來米價上漲一成半，由於運價高漲及外匯牌價提升之刺激云。</p>
<p>麵粉　扶搖直上，晨開兵船做一百四十九萬五千，老車做一百五十萬，軋升三萬五千至四萬元，結果兵船以一百四十九萬收盤，計高三萬，老車粉以一百五十一萬收盤，與孔雀同高五萬元。麩皮加五萬元，小麥公記開二百二十萬，加高二十萬元。</p>

<h3 id="c108">神經病 <a href="#c108" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e108" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">108</a></h3>
<p>— 靖文</p>
<p>這幾天報紙上獨多關於神經病者的新聞，看了令人確實奸笑，雖然當事人均不承認自已有神經病，且更有控訴他人爲神經病者，不過一個旣自封甚麽天主　，主張禁絕各國革命黨以至拆白黨，一個憑空要求法院鑑定他人有神經病，姑不論這些行爲是否出於一時嬉戯，但其精神缺乏健全，恐無疑問。因爲一個精神正常的人，決不會有如此乖謬的言行，即使是尋開心惡作劇，大槪也有一個範圍。我雖不敢說他們確犯有精神病，不過精神失常（那怕是偶發性的），大槪是不會錯。</p>
<p>據精神分析學家的意見，生活在現代都市中的人，十有八九都患有精神失常症，衹是程度有輕重，時間有長短，而且因爲彼此同病相憐，大家不容易覺察。譬如說歇斯底里症，過去以爲衹有女性會犯此病，現在知道不論男女都是一樣。特別在投機塲所中，如果你能冷眼觀察，幾乎每個人都犯着輕重不一的歇斯底里．試想那種喜怒哀樂無常的情景，豈不是最有力的證據嗎？</p>
<p>人的神經耐力原是有限度的，但是都市社會的生活中刺激却源源不絕，別的且不說，我們衹要翻開每天的報紙，就不知有多少够人傷腦筋的新聞。國際舞台上的角鬥，戰塲上的厮殺，以及黄色，桃色，灰色的社曾新聞，直接影響生活的經濟消息等等，那一件不叫人感受精神上的刺激。</p>
<p>也計有人以爲社會生活愈富動態而複雜，是表示人類生活內容的豐富與富有生氣。例如生長都市的兒童，比鄉村兒童要伶俐活潑得多。都市間的成人，外表上都較相仿年齡的鄉下男女看米年靑，四十左右的男人猶是　飛機頭一，而有了四五個孩子的母親，憑了化妝的高明，幾可和她們的兒女姊妹相稱。</p>
<p>這些確是事實，至少在現象上看來是如此。因爲緊張多變的生活確有使人在精神上喚起返老還童的感覺。像高度都市化的英美社會中，就曾有人提倡人生始自四十甚至七十的主張。但都市社會中患神經病者遠較鄉村中爲多，則亦爲不容否認的事實。</p>
<p>不過都市生活雖然容易使人犯神經衰弱症，但並非沒有救治之道。如果大家能對人生的意義看得透澈一些，對一切事物看得自然一些，則都市生活雖然緊張，你的頭腦仍能保持相當寗靜，自然不致引起精神失常。因爲都市生活的緊張與刺激性，都不過是人爲的東西。我們時常看見許多人終日急急忙忙，走路像奔喪，吃飯不辨味，每　幾分鐘就要看看他的錶，逢到電話打不通時幾乎要摔掉電話機，紅燈時他偏要衝過馬路，搶　電車等於衝鋒陷陣　這些人的生活眞是　　極了。然而他眞　　　了不得的事嗎　　　十九未必。泰　　是因爲一向在緊張的氣氛中磨折了神經，所以任何芝麻般大的事，在他亦非出之緊張態度不可。</p>
<p>我並不是說人生中絕無需要集中全神爲之的事。現在是科學世界，大部份的工作是需要正確的時間配合的，所以有時必需緊張。然而人類在未受科學文明洗禮之前，也一樣的過了千百年生活，至今農村社會中還是如此。科學文明的最高目的原是要改善人的生活福祉，它是人類自己創造的結果，故仍應由人去支配。如果你反受它的支配，你就不免做了科學文明的犧牲者了。一切神經衰弱症者，如果能懂得用自然的態度去支配科學文明，支配都市生活，我敢保證他可指日而愈。</p>
<h3 id="c109">嚴重 <a href="#c109" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e109" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">109</a></h3>
<p>— 何苦</p>
<p>這一時期，我們常可以在報上看到一個熟悉的字眼：「嚴重」。例如「事態嚴重」，一神色嚴重」……等等。假如說報紙上多見「嚴重」字樣，乃非生民之福，亦不爲過。因爲蚩蚩者氓，最歡喜過的日子便是安樂平易，最怕的是嚴重艱難，一遇到事情嚴重，其中必有困難。假如「微笑」可以隨着「嚴重」而來的話，豈不大妙？然而這是關起門來的自言自語，萬事豈能盡如人意，此所以「嚴重」一出，生靈攢眉也。</p>
<p>但世上嚴重的事，一半是屬於事態本身的尷尬，一半是主觀者的心境所造成。我們從小處着限：鄙人自負有計算才能，所以小至一筆香烟支出，亦必記錄在日用賬內。關於記零用賬，有好多人早已否定了它的功用。以前人記零用賬，爲的是可以在支付上獲得平衡，有量入爲出的深意存　。自大票出而儲蓄絕跡，記零用賬更是屬於迂腐一流，鄙人必欲硜硜自守，並非抱殘守缺不够開通，乃是自負頗高，欲且從小處做起耳。却說這本零用賬，記雖然每天記，往往弄不準，不是今天多上萬元便是昨天少五萬元，有時爲了數字不準，埋頭苦思，想從思索中追回一筆湘記的用賬，其苦况不殊大科學家的爲一個難解的方程式動腦筋。而外觀的嚴重，每使一個不速的朋友爲之驚愕，怎麽，老兄爲什麼如此嚴重的在埋頭沈思？一朋友不免要作如是想法。</p>
<p>其實想穿了有何嚴重之可言，用賬不準，算了吧，差幾萬塊錢，是私人的零用賬，又非虧空公款，犯不着這樣的苦思。據說「推敲」的祖師在考慮究竟應該用「僧敲月下門　呢，還是用一僧推月下鬥」的過程中，共費了三年的時間。所以當他後來決定用「僧敲月下門」的時候，便另行寫了四行：「二句三年得，一吟雙淚流，知音如不悟，歸臥故山秋。」其對於自己的著述，嚴重有如此者。然而這是大詩家的千秋吟詠，還値得嚴重一下，鄙人的零用賬是什麽東西，何必爲了區區數萬元而愁眉苦思，難以自解？即使是功利主義者，怕也要竊笑我的不値得爲了這些不數而大動腦筋吧。</p>
<p>因此嚴重一事，還須自己能看得開，解鈴繫鈴，原是一人。有許多大事，不過是放大鏡裏的零用賬，能看得開，斯不嚴重矣。至於事態本身犯着嚴重病症者，恕我不敢論列，蓋事關大計，非瞎三話四所能「一言解紛」也。</p>

<p>— 錢大成</p>
<p>章太炎爲革命文豪，又爲一代　學大師，有章瘋子之目。具遺聞逸事，散在人口，然以錢基博師「現代中國文學史」所記爲詳審。同里金叔遠先生，淸末嘗與太炎共事於東吳大學，述其逸事，爲衆所未道，爰筆之於篇：</p>
<p>太炎篤志治學，不諳世故，同事中惟推許常熟黄摩西爲可與論學，終夜與之刺刺語不休，旁人不諳彼兩人所談爲何事也。摩西亦奇人，予另爲文記之·太炎嘗云：「學者須有腦病，乃能治學有成；予亦有腦病者也。」</p>
<p>太炎在蘇州日，髮辮早已剪去，爲人所側目，因裝假辮於帽，又不縫於帽上，乃嵌於帽內。每入市街，假辮屢墮於地，旁人更爲側目。又不諳路途，自天賜莊至觀前，尙屢屢迷途。同事中因共賭賽曰：「，太炎若自天賜莊至觀前不迷途，不墮辮，當輸一席盛筵。」竟無人敢賭此東道焉。聞在上海日，亦迷途不得歸。往詢巡捕曰：「吾家安在？」巡捕怪之。彼乃大怒曰：「豈吾家尙不知耶？」因送之捕房，詢其姓氏，乃送之歸。</p>
<p>太炎不甚事洗沐，髮長數寸，亦不知整容。同事竺某每過月餘，輒謂彼曰：「可以理髮矣。」曰：「諾」。乃即理髮，竺某爲付理髮資，若是者屢屢矣。一日，忽謂叔遠先生：「彼竺姓乎？」叔遠大笑曰：「彼爲君屢付理髮資，乃不識其人乎？」</p>
<p>昔年予在無錫，嘗聽太炎演講。彼態度從容，鼻音微塞，講時吸紙烟不休。偶欲起立寫黑板，乃以紙烟誤爲粉筆；及寫畢就座復講，又以粉筆誤爲紙烟，就口在吸。聽講者不禁哄堂大笑云。</p>

<p>戰爭後的世界，雖是還充滿了火藥氣味，可是厭戰的人們，大都已把他們的興趣從戰爭而轉向了別的事物。</p>
<p>今日除了戰事之外，最使人矚目的該是籌備將趨成熟的世運大會了。據我估計，關心世運會的人可能較開心時局的人更多。事實上，這是一個可喜的現象。</p>
<p>戰爭，無非是國與國之間實力的衡量。可是其中不可避免的，總有無數良善的人民和不少美麗城鎭，化在烽火之中。以純人道觀點來看，戰爭的確是應該廢除的，不過兩國在交涉至臉紅耳赤，利害衝突至不能不由武力解決時，如不背城一戰，也就沒有他途可循。</p>
<p>然而雨國之間實力的衡量，衹有戰爭途嗎？不！還有運動。從運動可以看出一國人民的體力及一國眞正的實力。那麽即將開幕的世運會，幾乎就等於一次世界大戰，各國的榮辱，都可在這裏判斷出來。能够在世運會中稱霸，才是名副其實的强國。凡强國都該有健全的國民，不是我們也常在喊强國先强種嗎？</p>
<p>似使以後的國際衝突——不論爲的什麼而起——不訴之於戰爭，而決之於運動比賽，那該是人類最大的福音了！可惜僅是我的幻想而已。</p>

<p>渚齋在車上心裏先打疊了許多話，見着雲卿應如何說法，她若不答應，應如何懇求她，把她得沒有話說，她一定會答應我。鳳笙今天如此表示，固然可惱，若是事情因此有了轉機，則塞翁失馬，安知非福，我想這一次，一定有了結果。渚齋」路想着，及車子到了門口，　着電鈴，李媽出來開門，一看是渚齋，先說道：一大小姐上天津去了。「渚齋不由一呆道：」什麼時候上天津去的？李媽道：「不是有信給你嗎？」渚齋道：「我沒收到他的信。一面說，一面直往樓上走去，心裏很不相信，覺得李媽的話未必靠得住，到樓上一直走進雲卿的臥室，見屋內陳設仍舊，衹是床上的被褥，和書桌上的書籍，已全收起來，再看桌上玻璃板下，那張照片也沒有了，知道雲卿確是已赴天津，這一去並不是短時間能回來的。當下便徵徵嘆了一口氣問道：「大小姐有沒有說什麼時候回來？」李媽道：「沒有說。這次上天津，帶了好些衣服去，不槪不會快回來吧！」渚齋點點頭，向屋內一看，雖然一切都沒有變更，可是屋在人遐，別有一種凄凉滋味，心裏很是難過，見李媽怔怔看着他，只好說道：「我沒想到大小姐也上天津去。」李媽道：「你有事，可以寫信給我們小姐，天津離這兒又不遠，你可以上天津找她呀。一渚齋勉强應了一聲，走到門口，李媽知道他心裏難過，說道：「小姐★回來，我就打電話吿訴你。」渚齋點點頭，坐上車，心裏覺得太空虛了，好像一個人墜落在大海裏，在巨浪澎湃中，不知漂流到何處？很想找一個曠野中大哭一塲，才覺得痛快。這時心無所着，便吩咐車夫一直拉到武功衛家裏去。</p>

<p>— 清雷學園</p>
<p>前淸宜統初年，始議恢復海軍，親貴用事，攝政王載　之胞弟載洵，年少高興，出洋考察海軍，歸國即籌辦，一切茫然，敦請薩老將共同計畫，粗有頭緒即設立海軍部，以載洵爲大臣（即部長），以譚學衡爲副大臣，而老薩則京部無可位置，派充艦隊總司令，體制尙優，但係外任。至民國初年，老袁武力自雄，利用海軍護其政權，所信任者爲劉冠雄氏，命爲海軍總長，對於老薩之超然風格，則敬而遠之。袁死黎繼，海長爲程豐光，老薩仍未一握軍政之權，其與政局及海軍之關係，始終似有若無若即若　。然談及海軍元老者，無人不道薩鎭冰，物望之歸，自有歷史關係。</p>
<p>民國紀元前一年之秋，武昌革命軍起，總督瑞澂逃走，省城失陷，淸廷大駭，急命陸軍大臣蔭昌率睦軍兩鎭南下，又命薩鎭冰率長江艦隊水陸並進。老薩與黎元洪本有師生之誼，老黎給老薩一封信，剴陳大義，老薩的態度本不積極，至此絕對不與革命軍對敵。陸軍方面則由蔭昌而轉到老袁。老袁的肚裏，另有乾坤，至淸室退位，民國成立，有人推舉老薩，老袁說是好人者無用之別名，遂將海軍大權付與劉冠雄，劉氏帮老袁是眞賣力氣，其個人之富足，亦大有賴於老袁之提携，劉與薩之恬淡寗靜作風完全不同、</p>
<p>昔年上海出版之當代名人傳（沃丘費氏著），記薩鎭冰　其「樸實儉素，操守廉潔，出乘人力車不挈扈從，生平不爲欺人語，而剛健弗足，應事輙莫能斷，故早膺專聞，而威令不行。」言皆確當，此其所以爲「反常的武人」，「獨行的關人」也。記得二十二年十九路軍首腦及一部分政客在閩組織所謂人民政府，且劃全省爲多區之省，而推舉老薩爲省長之一，遠這固不得其詳，然就其已往之作風測之，必然亦是說好便好，上任就上任，而心不在焉，隨遇而安，此一組織，不久即瓦解，老薩之鄉書風度，老嫗面貌如故也。他是「滿不在乎」，亦「滿不相干」。</p>
<p>「名人傳」又云：「其子自美留學歸，自設宴款之，捧觴進曰：此後父子析居，各自爲政，此筵即以餞爾，祝爾自立。旁觀者皆掩口。」按其公子旣以學成歸國，便是爲國家爲社會服務之起點，現代文明，非同舊式封建，人是公民，並非家庭之贅疣，父母敎育子女，自有一定之限度。子女對父母自宜孝養，然亦不能於國家社會之外，單獨成爲附屬。薩翁此舉，於情理於事實，均無不合，但非頑腐腦筋所能解，宜其掩口而笑矣。即此一事而觀察薩翁一生，胸中自有經緯，即其海軍學識，海軍計實，亦雅擅經綸，而對於各種現職之「麻麻胡胡」，實在亦有許多事近乎兒戲，無可認眞，加以本性恬淡，更樂得敷衍耳。薩翁固非大有爲之豪傑，然眞正有爲的人，　薄現實，安於消極者，亦往往有之。</p>

<p>（五）關於技術員方面：凡及齡壯丁，如要援用技術員作緩役的理由，就必須要檢同專門學校畢業證書，和機關或塲廠服任技術職員證或技工檢定書，申請緩役。但技術員工不是指一般而言，是要根據行政院頒發的有關國防工業專門技術員工緩召適用範圍以內，方可認爲合格的。這次審査，都是根據勞慟局技術員工登記證，和機關塲廠服任技術職務證明書來決定的，沒有上面所說二種證件，即不能認爲各於有關國防技術員工的條例，不能准許緩召。</p>
<p>（六）關於小學敎師方面：小學敎師申請緩役，要繳小學敎師登記證和聘書，並且還要根據敎育局審査合格之名册，經過詳加核對才可認作合格，本市卅六年度是項小學敎師由請都沒有檢附登記證件，衹有學校證明書，依法不合，必須補繳。</p>
<p>（七）關於乒役法第二十六條五款之規定：兵役法第廿六條五款規定「獨負家庭生計而無同胞兄弟或有同胞兄弟而均已應召或均未滿十八歲者」可以緩召。本條的着重點，在獨負家庭生計一句話，如若沒有獨負家　生計的壯丁，雖然是獨子，仍要服兵役的。反之，雖然有幾個兄弟，但是他們的年齡最大的還沒有滿十八歲，也可以申請緩召。民政局因爲看到這條範圍過於廣泛，經斟酌實際情形，訂定了上海市獨負家庭生計責任標準，作爲審査依據。惟審査此項申請時，發覺最普遍的現象，是寄居的市民，當地保甲長無法曉得他們實在有沒有兄弟，以及家　經濟狀况究竟怎樣。但有許多均能寄附原籍保甲長證明，或是檢附塲廠或　號負責人證明，我們均予照准。因爲我們的老百姓貧苦階級最多，只要父年在五十八歲以上，弟年未滿十八歲，沒有他人同事生產者，一律准許緩役。另外也有許多壯丁的父親，兄弟，年齡確未達上項規定，但是因疾病或殘廢不能生產的，也算合乎獨負家庭生計　任標準，可以同樣理由准許緩召。</p>

<h3 id="e1">Chairman Attends National Assembly This Morning to Report on Current Domestic and International Situation, Including Military, Political, and Economic Conditions <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 8th] The National Assembly will hold its fourth plenary session on the 9th, morning and afternoon. Chairman Chiang is scheduled to attend the meeting at 10:00 AM to deliver a comprehensive policy report. He will address the current domestic and international situation, the military progress in suppressing the bandits and quelling the rebellion, as well as the general political and economic conditions. The session on the 9th will be chaired by Zuo Shunsheng and Gan Naiguang. The assembly will continue discussing the unfinished sections of the rules of procedure and the organizational regulations of the proposal review committee. Furthermore, the proposals submitted by various delegates to the Presidium are being expedited for compilation.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 8th] Chairman Chiang, concerned about the progress of the National Assembly, visited the venue at 4:10 PM on the 8th to observe the proceedings, taking a seat in the government officials' section. Around the break at 5:00 PM, the Chairman separately met with representatives from Shandong and Henan provinces, as well as Pan Gongzhan, Chairman of the Shanghai Municipal Assembly, among others, staying for approximately two hours before departing. When the Chairman arrived at the venue, the meeting had only been in session for fifteen minutes. Dai Mingsheng was delivering a speech, responding to the appeals of the signing delegates, followed by Jiang Bingxing's attempt to speak forcefully, which was loudly rebuked by Zhang Boling. All of these events were witnessed by the Chairman. At that time, the atmosphere at the meeting was extremely agitated. The Chairman stood up and watched intently for a long time. Subsequently, he engaged in conversation with Pan Gongzhan in the seating area and met with Henan delegates Zhang Fang, Yan Dai Chong, and Chen Panling. Zhang and others directly reported the severe situation in the Central Plains, requesting the dispatch of a large army to secure Zhengzhou and Kaifeng, recover Luoyang, stabilize western Henan, and expedite the issuance of guns and ammunition to the Henan Provincial Security Brigade. The Chairman responded that a large army was being dispatched to Zhengzhou and Kaifeng, ensuring their security. The temporary abandonment of Luoyang was to concentrate forces and strike the main force of the bandits, with recovery expected soon. The bandits north of the Yangtze River and south of the Yellow River will also be eliminated in a short period. The issuance of weapons to the security brigade will be expedited. During the break, the Chairman also met with Shandong delegate Guo Junqing and others in the Presidium's office. Guo requested relief for the critical situation in central Shandong, requesting the airlift of a large army to Weixian and Changle to relieve the siege of the two areas. The Chairman indicated that he was paying close attention to the war situation in central Shandong and that new plans for troop movements and deployment were being implemented.</p>
<h3 id="e2">Draft Rules of Procedure Largely Amended and Passed, Adding Article "National Assembly May Discuss National Affairs" <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 8th] The third session of the National Assembly was held on the morning of the 8th. At 9:25 AM, Secretary-General Hong Lanyou reported that 2,551 delegates had registered, with 2,040 delegates present, meeting the legal quorum. The fourth group of the Presidium took turns chairing, and Chairman Wang Shijie announced the opening of the meeting. The session began with a moment of silence in memory of Wang Xifu, the delegate from Yongchang County, Gansu, who passed away on the 7th. The agenda then proceeded with the approval of the minutes of the previous session and the commencement of a clause-by-clause discussion of the draft rules of procedure for the assembly. The first, second, and third articles of the first chapter, "General Provisions," were passed without objection. However, the fourth article sparked debate due to Dong Xin's proposal to add a clause stating that "During the National Assembly sessions, the government's policy reports may be heard, national affairs may be discussed, and inquiries and suggestions may be made." Shi Songling urged the assembly to abide by the Constitution and to amend the powers granted to the assembly by the Constitution before proceeding, as there would otherwise be no legal basis, and rejection by the government would affect the assembly's prestige. Lin Zigui argued that Chairman Chiang had publicly stated that he would attend the assembly to explain the political situation, indicating that the government respected public opinion and supported Dong Xin's proposal. Shi Shangkuan suggested that Dong Xin's proposal did not need to be included in the rules but could be included in the agenda after a resolution by the assembly. He also proposed that the amendment to the fourth article proposed by Gu be voted on first. As a result, Zhao Yuanzhen's amendment, "The responsibility for maintaining the confidentiality of meetings extends to the staff of the Secretariat," was passed. The assembly continued to pass the sixth, seventh, and eighth articles of the second chapter, "Review of Delegate Qualifications," and the ninth and tenth articles of the third chapter. The eleventh article was passed with 1,170 votes in favor of Pan Gongzhan's amendment, which decided that each extension of the meeting time would be fifteen minutes, and if the quorum was still not met after two extensions, a discussion meeting would be held, with the session announced open when the quorum was met. The original drafts of the twelfth and thirteenth articles were passed. The fourteenth article was passed with 1,196 votes in favor of Liu Hua's amendment, which determined that the chairman must obtain the assembly's consent to extend the meeting time. After the sixteenth article was passed without objection, a heated debate arose again. Zhang Yuren proposed adding a "report" section to include government policy reports, representative opinions, inquiries, and suggestions. Dong Xin and others protested against the shelving of their proposal, and the crowd became agitated. Those who wanted to appeal to the assembly to respect the Constitution and offer opposing opinions were booed, and the entire venue was in chaos. After Chairman Wang strongly requested order and proceeded with the vote, the clause proposed by Dong Xin and others, which exceeded the powers granted to the National Assembly by the Constitution, was finally passed with 1,723 votes in favor (out of 2,041 people present) amidst thunderous applause, and was listed as the fifth article of the rules. After the break, the discussion of the seventeenth article of the fourth chapter continued. There were as many as fifteen amendments regarding the scope of the proposals, with most people advocating for expansion to include proposals related to national planning and people's livelihoods. Speakers rose one after another, and in the end, the proposal to delete the article was passed with 1,621 votes in favor, with over 96% of the 1,683 people present in agreement. Proposals were thus unrestricted in scope, and applause thundered again. As the eighteenth article was being discussed, it was already noon at 12:00 PM. The assembly opposed an extension, and adjournment was announced. The assembly only processed thirty-seven articles of the rules during the entire day of the 8th.</p>
<h3 id="e3">Continued Meeting in the Afternoon, Clause-by-Clause Discussion of the Rules <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>The meeting continued at 4:00 PM in the afternoon, with 1,531 delegates in attendance. Chairman Zhang Boling announced the continuation of the previous agenda and the clause-by-clause discussion of the eighteenth article of the rules of procedure regarding the number of cosigners for proposals. With the agreement of the entire assembly, the number was amended from sixty in the original draft to twenty. The nineteenth article was passed without objection. As soon as the twentieth article was discussed, the issue of signing delegates was raised, causing controversy and gradually disrupting the order of the meeting. Zhang Boling exercised his authority as chairman and announced the cessation of speaking, reversing the agenda. At this time, Chairman Chiang had arrived at the meeting and was seated in the officials' section, quietly observing the proceedings of the meeting. Subsequently, the twentieth article was voted on, with 1,301 votes in favor (out of 1,596 delegates present) passing the amendment proposed by Chen Yingxing and others, deciding that the proposal review report should be sent to each delegate one day before the meeting to discuss it. The twenty-first article passed Luo Shize's amendment, which stipulated that the Secretariat should print and send the amendment to the review report on the constitutional amendment to each delegate six or three hours before the second reading. The twenty-second and twenty-third articles were passed as originally drafted. The twenty-fourth article of the fifth chapter (temporary motions) was passed as originally drafted. The twenty-fifth article passed Zhang Jinfu's amendment, reducing the number of cosigners required to propose a temporary motion from sixty to thirty. The twenty-sixth and twenty-seventh articles were passed as originally drafted. The twenty-eighth to thirty-second articles of the sixth chapter (discussion), five in total, were passed as originally drafted. The thirty-third article passed Liu Shougang's amendment with 928 votes in favor (out of 1,021 delegates present), stating that the chairman may also stop delegates who express opinions similar to those of previous speakers from speaking. The thirty-fourth article passed Chen Yingxing's amendment with 731 votes in favor (out of 1,026 delegates present), stating that for the chairman's decision on procedural matters, a declaration that it must be put to a vote to determine its validity or invalidity only requires the opposition of thirty people (the original draft was fifty people). The thirty-fifth article was maintained as originally drafted. The thirty-sixth article passed Chen Jilie's amendment with 944 votes in favor (out of 1,132 delegates present), stating that a motion to end the discussion only requires the consent of a majority (the original draft required two-thirds) to be established. The thirty-seventh article was passed without objection. Between this article and the thirty-eighth article, it was proposed to add an article stipulating that voting may be conducted when necessary, but Zhang Tieseng's amendment was rejected. By 6:00 PM, Chairman Zhang sought the opinion of the assembly on extending the meeting time. Several delegates pointed out that the number of delegates present was no longer sufficient to meet the quorum, so adjournment was announced. The assembly only processed thirty-seven articles of the rules during the entire day of the 8th.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper, Guangzhou, 8th] US Ambassador to China, John Leighton Stuart, and David Bruce and a party of seven, flew into Guangzhou's Tianhe Airport at 2:35 PM on the 8th. T.V. Soong, Director of the Executive Headquarters, and other provincial and municipal leaders personally greeted them at the airport. The envoy, wearing a gray wool suit, had a broad smile as he disembarked and was driven to the US Consulate for rest without making any statements. T.V. Soong is scheduled to host a grand banquet on the 9th, and the US Consulate will also hold a grand reception on the 10th to introduce the envoy to people from all walks of life. It is understood that the envoy's mission is not limited to inspecting the operations of the US Consulate and visiting Mr. Soong. According to sources, his visit to Guangzhou is to discuss with Mr. Soong the use of US aid materials for reconstruction in South China, expanding the supply of materials, and paving the way for US investment and development in South China.</p>
<p>[United Press, Guangzhou, 8th] After arriving here, Ambassador John Leighton Stuart told a United Press reporter that he is scheduled to fly to Hainan Island on the 12th, with Chairman Soong possibly accompanying him, returning to Guangzhou on the 13th and returning to Nanjing on the 14th. The Ambassador denied reports that the trip has any special mission.</p>
<h3 id="e5">Issue of Signing Delegates' Attendance, Presidium Engages in Heated Discussion, Appoints Five to Negotiate with National Government for Reasonable Solution <a href="#e5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 8th] Regarding the issue of signing delegates attending the assembly, a motion from 1,332 delegates was raised at the third session on the 8th. The Presidium convened at 8:00 PM on the 8th and studied it in detail, adjourning only at 1:30 AM on the 9th. The Presidium meeting was presided over by He Yingqin, and Zuo Shunsheng, Yu Jiaju, Sun Yafu, and others attended. The motion was the subject of heated debate during the meeting. However, because the matter concerned the National Assembly Election and Recall Law and could not be resolved by the National Assembly Presidium, it was decided to submit it to the National Government, hoping for a legal and reasonable solution. Many members spoke during the discussion of the motion. Yu Bin, Gu Yuxiu, Gu Zhenggang, Pan Gongzhan, He Lu, Sun Yafu, and others all spoke. The Presidium expressed great concern for the fasting delegates and repeatedly studied the matter, deciding to appoint five people to negotiate with the National Government for a legal and reasonable solution. Yu Bin and others proposed two plans: (1) Over a hundred military representatives are all on the front lines suppressing bandits and cannot attend the assembly. Signing delegates may immediately attend to fill the vacancies. (2) The number of occupational representatives and women representatives is not stipulated in the Constitution but is determined by law. It is requested that the assembly resolve to ask the Legislative Yuan to amend the National Assembly Organization Law to increase the number of occupational and women representatives so that signing delegates can attend. Furthermore, the signing delegates and others gathered on the evening of the 8th to discuss the attendance issue, their emotions running high. They will express their views when the assembly discusses the issue. Furthermore, key members of the China Youth Party also discussed the issue of signing delegates on the evening of the 8th.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 8th] The issue of signing delegates was raised at the third session of the National Assembly on the afternoon of the 8th, but it was not discussed because the agenda had not been completed.</p>
<h3 id="e6">Vice-President Sun Discusses the International Situation, A Major War is Imminent, We Must Complete the Suppression of the Rebellion and Improve Military and Economic Affairs <a href="#e6" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c6" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">6</a></h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 8th] Vice-President Sun stated to our reporter at 6:00 PM on the 8th that constitutional governance and national construction require first suppressing the rebellion. The Communist rebellion has an international background, so suppressing the rebellion must be carried out with great determination and to the very end. If the Communists succeed in China, World War III will break out immediately. When the reporter asked if we could not solve the Communist problem and would delay it until it could be solved simultaneously with international problems, Sun said: Not so. He believed that the current international situation would not lead to a major war in the near future, while the Communist problem could be solved quickly and independently. Sun stated that to complete the suppression of the rebellion, efforts must be made to improve both military and economic affairs. For example, the organization of the Ministry of National Defense needs to be adjusted, but this issue is not simple. Regarding the economy, Sun believed that US aid of 338 million US dollars would allow China to receive nearly 30 million US dollars worth of materials per month, which could be sold to recover legal tender, reducing inflation and stabilizing prices.</p>
<p>When Sun discussed the election disputes, he stated: Based on the current situation, the procedures for preparing for the implementation of the Constitution stipulate that the first Legislative Yuan will convene on the seventh day after the National Assembly adjourns. Because the election disputes for the Legislative Yuan have not yet been resolved, it is feared that it will be difficult to realize as scheduled. Sun said: The signing delegates and nominated delegates' request to attend the assembly will inevitably cause a problem with the number of seats. Some people intend to include them in occupational groups, which does not seem appropriate, because the National Assembly delegates for occupational groups should be produced by occupational groups. Currently, only the National Assembly has the authority to decide on a solution. In the election of legislators, the problem is simpler than that of the National Assembly because there are no members of the party who signed the nominations. The same method as the National Assembly may be used for friendly parties. Sun argued on the basis of the election law: There is no difference between formal nominees and alternates, both are introductions. The result should be that those with more votes are elected. If we consider the facts to seek coordination, then we need to wait for the central government to decide.</p>

The areas with the greatest need for food include Guangdong, Guangxi, Shandong, and part of Hebei, as well as the flooded areas downstream of the Liao River. China hopes to obtain most of the rice allocated in the 1947 recommendations from the United States and Southeast Asia this year, but 40,000 tons of rice are still awaiting shipment in Burma and Siam due to shipping difficulties.</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 8th] Ju Zheng, President of the Judicial Yuan, issued a statement on the 8th, in order to obey the party's resolution, stating that he would not run for president. The original text is as follows: "I am not self-effacing in my mediocrity. I occasionally listened to the advice of friends and came out to run for president. Later, I was surrounded by reporters and made fragmented remarks. Although it was said to be attracting a phoenix with a panpipe, those who know the situation have already smiled at me. Fortunately, after in-depth research and a solemn resolution by the party's plenary session, it unanimously requested that the President emerge and be elected as the first presidential candidate. Since public opinion has a consensus and opinions converge on one point, as a party member, I should immediately obey the party's resolution and no longer make any remarks about running for the presidency to confuse the public. I hereby declare."</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, Guangzhou, 8th] The Guangzhou Liaison Society and other eight revolutionary groups believe that the selection of the first president is of utmost importance and that Chairman Chiang is the only suitable candidate. However, regarding the vice-presidential election, the old revolutionary comrades all believe that Vice-President Sun is deeply aware of the true meaning of democracy and has been assisting the central government and presiding over the constitution-making process in recent years. To assist the President as the Vice-President after the implementation of the Constitution is the most appropriate choice. A campaign committee has been established and is sending telegrams to overseas locations and various regions to call for support.</p>

<p>Our Newspaper Special Feature (April 8, Nanjing)</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 8th] An unseasonal heatwave entered the capital, with the mercury rising to over 80 degrees. Outdoors, the sun was scorching, and indoors, it was stuffy and hot, like the eve of a storm.</p>
<p>Today's agenda was to discuss the rules of procedure for the assembly clause by clause. Wang Shijie and Zhang Boling shared the chairmanship of the assembly in the morning and afternoon. The rules of procedure were full of hidden reefs, and the first chapter, "General Provisions," was already hitting a reef. Some argued that the National Assembly should be able to hear government policy reports, review national affairs, and make inquiries and suggestions. Another representative, however, sent out a weaker voice in front of the loudspeaker: "This belongs to the representatives' authority. I very much agree, but I think the representatives should respect the Constitution. If this amendment is added, it will not comply with Article 27 of the Chiang Constitution." But the audience's response was a chorus of boos. Then, Lin Zigui, claiming to be speaking on behalf of several representatives, shouted: "Looking at the content presented by Chairman Chiang to the Central Executive Committee of the Kuomintang yesterday, our request for the government to make policy reports and review the current situation has already been approved by Chairman Chiang; we ask the chairman (referring to the chairman of the assembly) to pay attention to the situation." This signal was ultimately diverted by the chairman's diplomatic methods, and he calmly shifted the goal, saying that it would be discussed when discussing Article 17. But this only sought a moment of silence. After a series of unanimous passages from Article 6 to Article 16, the discussion of Article 17 had already arrived. This loud call explained that they were fighting for "rights," that is, expanding powers that affected the Constitution itself. Although most people were wondering if revising would shake the Constitution, this call aroused enthusiasm. So, whoever stood up and said to respect the Constitution was out of touch, whoever was the enemy of this impulsive mood. Some uttered shadowy sentences that violated the Constitution.</p>
<p>The meeting was not announced until five minutes before 4:00 PM. Only ten minutes passed, and the storm came. Representative Wang Yunming jumped onto the speaker's platform and, in an extremely calm attitude, loud voice, and melodious tone, called on the 1,332 representatives who cosigned the motion to appeal for the fasting signing delegates. He said: "This will be more important than anything else, I ask everyone to pay attention. The fasting delegates have already written their death notes. If they really die from fasting, it will not only be a shame for the assembly but also a stain on constitutional governance. People are not made of wood or stone, who can be indifferent? Please ask the chairman to accept the motion for the signing delegates to attend the assembly and submit it to the assembly for discussion." This motion won applause. At this time, Chairman Chiang walked out of the door on the left side of the podium, wearing casual clothes, and gently walked to the officials' platform. The audience below, upstairs, and downstairs was noisy and chaotic. At this moment, Jiang Bingxing, a representative of the China Youth Party, because he wanted to express his opinion on Wang Yunming's words, ran towards the speaker's platform. The chairman said that he was stopping the speech now, but it had no effect. Yu Jiaju also shouted from the loudspeaker behind: "We are here to govern constitutionally, not to destroy the constitution, and we cannot submit it for discussion. The chairman should be responsible for it." Jiang Bingxing insisted on speaking. Chairman Zhang Boling sternly said: "I won't let you speak"! The old man roared, but it was useless. In the cries from upstairs that "People are going to starve to death" mixed with applause, applause, and jeers, Chen Qitian persuaded Jiang Bingxing to leave, saying it was a relief, and the storm slowly subsided. Chairman Chiang, sitting on the officials' platform, stood up at the most chaotic moment but sat down after only two minutes. Some said that it was because he stood up that those who instigated the storm knew that the wind was calming down.</p>
<p>Chairman Zhang Boling and Secretary-General Hong Lanyou continued the meeting procedure and discussed the remaining chapters and rules in order. Today's storm is over.</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 7th] Acting Secretary of State Lovett stated today that the State Department will formulate a new policy toward Japan based on the reports it has already received from the Department of the Army and State Department delegations that have visited Japan separately or jointly. This statement was made in response to reporters asking whether the State Department would send representatives to Japan to investigate the situation in Japan in order to supplement the reports of the Overseas Consultants, Inc., and the Clapp Mission.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 7th] The US State Department today firmly denied rumors that the US government is considering a $1 billion "Mini-Marshall Plan" to revive the Far East economy.

<p>[Central News Agency, London, 7th] British Labour MP Mr. Batten recently summarized the views of British industry regarding Japan, stating: "To enable Japan to survive while ensuring that it does not become a threat to the international community is the test of our political work in the peace conference. Japan must not be allowed to engage in industrial competition at will again. The way to achieve this is to implement a plan for the utilization of Japanese industry, which must be rationally completed in accordance with the needs and resources of other countries. Currently, British industry feels envious of the recovery of Japanese industry under MacArthur's protection."</p>

<p>[Associated Press, Nanjing, 8th] The Associated Press sent a written inquiry to Foreign Minister Wang Shijie on the 8th regarding China's attitude towards the development of new US policies towards Japan. Wang replied, "China's policy remains consistent, and our government's position is no different from what was announced on February 13th." Wang stated on February 13th that if there are guarantees to prevent Japan from rebuilding its military strength, China is willing to support all reconstruction policies for enemy countries. Authoritative sources say that although China will not change its policy towards Japanese reconstruction due to recent developments, it is paying close attention to these developments. China has long anticipated that US policy towards Japan would change, so it does not feel surprised or embarrassed by the Strack report and the Clapp Mission. Reliable sources say that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs feels that the US and China are in complete agreement on preventing the resurgence of Japanese militarism. Although the Chinese government does not believe that the US would do so, some quarters have criticized the US for its "naivete."</p>

<p>[Associated Press, Bogotá, Colombia, 7th] Argentina and Guatemala on the 7th requested the Pan-American Conference to invoke the principle of "The Americas for the Americans" to eliminate foreign colonies in the Western Hemisphere. Argentine representative Colomina adopted this stance to defend Argentina's claim to the British-held Falkland Islands and the expansion of South Antarctic territories to the Antarctic. Guatemala suggested eliminating European colonies in the Americas, namely British Honduras, British, French and Dutch Guiana, and the West Indies. Colomina expressed his approval and proposed amending it to include the Falkland Islands and the South Antarctic region. It is expected that Guatemala will propose the establishment of a permanent committee representing the Pan-American Union to directly consult with European countries on the peaceful resolution of colonial issues. Chilean representative Enríquez also supported Argentina's proposal. Chile has also made claims to South Antarctic territories, which conflict with Argentina. The two countries are now trying to resolve the dispute. At the same time, the US delegation suggested that legal disputes between American countries should be resolved by the International Court of Justice.</p>

<p>Refuses Investigation by the Four-Power Committee</p>
<p>[Reuters, Berlin, 8th] British Commander-in-Chief Robertson returned to Berlin today from Düsseldorf by special plane. The British side's reply to the Soviet side regarding the Berlin plane collision is being drafted by the British Headquarters. Robertson had two telephone conversations with London last night regarding this matter. Soviet Commander-in-Chief Sokolovsky's letter to Robertson on the 6th of this month was released today. The letter rejected the British request for the Four-Power Committee to investigate the collision, insisting that the investigation be carried out by the British and Soviet sides only. It also stated that Robertson's letter to him, especially the British newspapers' reports on the plane collision, all accused the Soviet plane of deliberately causing the incident, which was malicious slander and intentional provocation.</p>

<p>[Reuters, Berlin, 7th] A British official spokesperson stated that none of the four powers has taken action to convene a meeting of the Allied Control Council. The meeting was originally scheduled to be held on April 10th. In addition, French Foreign Ministry Political Director Merville suddenly arrived in Berlin today, leading people to believe that there has been progress in the talks on the merger of the French zone with the British and American zones. Although Merville said that this trip was purely for social purposes, this statement is not widely believed.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Paris, 7th] The French government solemnly stated that it will continue to do its best to keep the door open for negotiations regarding the German issue "until the very last moment." People in Paris believe that Robertson's intention is to inform the Soviet Union that the Western powers are already engaged in the final preparations for establishing a West German government.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 7th] Political figures here believe that the remarks made by Robertson, the British military governor in Germany, in Düsseldorf on the 7th, indicate that the division of Germany has become an undeniable fact. The Western occupying powers are now only waiting for the separation between East and West Germany to become absolute. Robertson's remarks are the first time that a senior British official in Germany has declared to the world that Britain and the US have recognized the Soviet Union's withdrawal from the Allied Control Council on March 20th as a warning that East and West Germany are about to part ways. London observers believe that the two most important points in Robertson's entire speech are the insistence that currency reform is the current urgent task of the British-American merged zone authorities, and his emphasis that the Frankfurt Economic Council can be quickly transformed into a political government organization when necessary. The deadline for a four-power agreement on all-German currency reform is next Sunday, that is, the day after Clay convenes a meeting of the Allied Control Council on April 11th. If the Soviet Union still refuses to attend the meeting, the Western countries will regard the deadline as having passed, and cooperation is impossible, and the Western countries will have the freedom to carry out their plans on their own.

<p>[Associated Press, Rome, 7th] Regarding the general election to be held in Italy on the 18th of this month, it is now clear that it will be a great victory. This statement is not intended to predict the election results, but only to report that the Communist Party's current hopes of victory seem very different from what they were a month ago. However, unexpected events can still occur, especially unexpected actions on the part of the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union has so far remained almost entirely aloof from the election campaign.</p>

<p>[Reuters, Washington, 8th] Republican foreign policy expert Dulles has suggested to Secretary of State Marshall that an international anti-communist intelligence agency be organized to protect the free institutions of the Western world.

<h3 id="e31">US Suffers First Setback at the International Conference on Freedom of the Press; General Assembly Passes Two Proposals Despite US Opposition <a href="#e31" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c31" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">31</a></h3>
<p>[Reuters, Geneva, 7th] The US suffered two setbacks today at the International Conference on Freedom of the Press. One was the passage of a resolution by the General Assembly encouraging the establishment of government-supported news agencies in countries without established news agencies, regardless of whether these countries discriminate against foreign news agencies. The other was the passage by a majority vote in the General Assembly's main committee of a resolution on the elimination of bias. The division of the Western countries' line at the meeting has been the first time since the meeting opened.</p>
<p>The US intended to have the General Assembly pass a resolution condemning irresponsible journalism, but at the same time, it could not adopt any opinions put forward by the Soviet Union to avoid giving the Soviet Union an excuse for propaganda. The US has now discovered that the drafting committee is in danger of adopting some Soviet opinions and forming a compromise proposal. The main reason for the US's failure is that Australia's proposal of a lengthy amendment has changed the wording of the US resolution, making many representatives believe that the amendment cannot be merged with the US resolution unless the drafting committee forms a compromise proposal. Australia, France, and several countries on the European continent have formed a united line on this, advocating the adoption of stronger wording than the US resolution. Regarding the resolution on news agencies, it states, "In countries where national news agencies are not yet developed, their governments may support news agencies until these news agencies are fully developed, and foreign news agencies shall not unfairly or abnormally impede the development of other countries' news agencies." US representative Brown, with the support of the Soviet Union, Mexico, the Philippines, and Uruguay, opposed the resolution, believing that the resolution encouraged the establishment of news monopolies. The Yugoslav representative then attacked the US's Associated Press and United Press, pointing out that they are monopolistic businesses controlled by a few people, such as the United States being controlled by a few people such as McCormick and Hearst. In the end, the resolution opposed by the US was passed by a vote of sixteen to five.</p>
<p>[US Information Service, Geneva, 7th] The General Committee of the United Nations Conference on Freedom of the Press voted to accelerate the work of the meeting in order to adjourn on April 20th, and to hold plenary meetings for the last four days of the session.</p>

<p>[Reuters, Washington, 7th] The Senate has verbally approved the appointment of Hoffman as the executor of the European Recovery Program, also in charge of economic aid to China. Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Vandenberg told senators today that the Foreign Relations Committee had spoken with Hoffman for an hour and a half, reviewing "every stage of the foreign aid bill, and the Foreign Relations Committee is completely satisfied. Hoffman has a basic understanding of the relevant issues." Hoffman said after the Senate approved his new position that he believes that it will take a considerable amount of time to organize the management of the aid to Europe program in Washington. He hopes that the organization of the foreign part will be undertaken by an ambassador-at-large. The selection of his assistants has not yet been determined, and he hopes that one or two of his old partners from the Studebaker Corporation can join.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 7th] The Senate today passed the appointment of Hoffman as the executor of the economic aid to Europe and China plan. It is believed that President Truman will soon nominate a deputy executor and an ambassador-at-large to supervise and coordinate the recovery plan in Europe.</p>

<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 8th] Although former Minnesota Governor Stassen won a major victory in the Wisconsin Republican presidential primary, New York Governor Dewey has already won 106 of the 303 national convention delegates who have been elected, accounting for more than one-third.

<p>[Associated Press, Milwaukee, Wisconsin, 7th] Former Minnesota Governor Stassen defeated General MacArthur and New York Governor Dewey by an overwhelming margin in the significant Wisconsin Republican presidential primary. His hopes of becoming a presidential candidate have suddenly gained momentum. Reports from 3,138 polling districts in Wisconsin have only 102 districts unfinished, so the belonging of the 27 delegates to the Republican National Convention seems to be a foregone conclusion. Stassen won 19 delegates, and MacArthur won 8. Dewey has only a slight hope of winning one delegate seat. In the 5th Congressional District, the situation is still unclear, and Dewey's delegate is only 112 votes fewer than Stassen's delegate. The candidate with the most votes for Stassen's statewide delegates was Kohler, with 228,217 votes. The candidate with the most votes for MacArthur's delegates was former Governor La Follette, with 207,237 votes.</p>

<p>Copyright by Scripps Howard Newspaper Alliance. Translated by our Editorial Department. (13) The Mixed Blessings of the Salween River Campaign</p>
<p>The American supply plan for China's Salween River campaign was a pathetic failure. This campaign was initiated under the pressure of General Stilwell in 1944.</p>
<p>The record of this campaign seems to confirm that Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek was reluctant to participate in this addition to the Burma campaign, and rightly so, as the British had already cancelled their commitment to an amphibious landing in lower Burma. In the winter of 1942-3, Stilwell estimated that the Salween expeditionary force could fight if it received 2,000 tons of airlifted goods per month, but several months later, at a strategic conference in Washington, he estimated that the Salween troops needed 10,000 tons of stockpiled goods. In the end, even this number proved to be very conservative.</p>
<p>Although the American Y Force, responsible for training and equipping the expeditionary force, had been in existence for over a year before the Chinese army forcibly crossed the Salween River in May 1944, the organization failed to complete an effective supply plan. About two weeks before the expeditionary force actually began fighting, the overland supply plan along the Salween River was abandoned and replaced by an aerial resupply plan. As a result, the work of flying over the Hump was further dispersed, and China's monthly cargo from the Hump decreased by more than 1,000 tons.</p>
<p>The failure of the Salween River supply plan came to my attention in March 1944, when a representative of General Dorn, commander of the Y Force, consulted with me, asking if it was advisable to transport supplies from the Hump area by air to the vicinity of the Salween River front.</p>
<p>He explained that the supplies were stockpiled in Yunnan Yi, but the Y Force lacked road transport to move the supplies westward. He also said that the Y Force's plan required about 7,000 head of livestock to transport supplies from near the unloading point to the battle zone, but they obtained less than 3,000 head of livestock.</p>
<p>In addition to the actual lack of trucks, the supply problem was further complicated by the lack of proper refueling facilities for the few trucks available. Therefore, every month, 500 to 1,000 tons of alcohol had to be airlifted from Kunming to Yunnan Yi. This alcohol, made in China, was used to replace better fuel.</p>
<p>It is worth pointing out that the sudden westward movement of fuel from the Kunming area virtually brought the already insufficient truck operations to the air force bases in southeastern China to a complete standstill.</p>
<p>Despite repeated protests, the Y Force's priority for truck fuel continued to reduce supply operations to the east, forcing a major reduction in air operations before the Japanese offensive and forcing the Fourteenth Air Force to retreat to rear bases when the Battle of Hengyang reached its climax.</p>
<p>Because the number of transport livestock could not meet the needs, the Chinese troops in the mountains and on the other side of the Salween River had to rely on aerial drops to obtain food, guns, and ammunition. In my opinion, this situation was clearly caused by a misconception on the part of the ground commanders, who believed that the Chinese were "hoarding" trucks and livestock. Dorn consistently believed that the Chinese were deliberately holding on to these tools. He even accused the Chinese of hiding trucks for post-war use, although it is difficult to imagine that trucks could be left unused throughout the war and still be useful afterwards.</p>
<p>Moreover, careful investigation did not reveal any hidden trucks, and there was no way to refute the Yunnan provincial authorities' claim that providing even half of the 70,000 head of livestock needed would be enough to render the entire province uncultivable and lead to famine. During the war, the stories of hoarding were told to such an extreme extent by those who criticized China that they became ridiculous. When southeastern China was lost in 1944 due to American insistence on concentrating efforts in Burma, the Guilin Garrison Command was accused of hoarding simply because it had 2,000 rounds of light artillery shells.</p>
<p>In fact, the most severe criticism we can level against the Guilin Garrison Command is that this "hoarding" was far too little when Guilin was attacked by the Japanese.</p>

<h3 id="e40">Sharp Increase in Prices of Water, Electricity, Telephone, and Gas This Month. Telephone Price Reaches 98%. Councilors to Meet to Stabilize Prices. Request Central Government to Adopt Suggestions. Advance Foreign Exchange Settlement for Public Utility Equipment, or Subsidies May Be Provided in Three Months. <a href="#e40" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c40" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">40</a></h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] The prices of four public utilities in the city, including water, electricity, telephone, and gas, have been internally determined to be adjusted from today. The new prices for April have been reviewed and decided by the Public Utilities Bureau last night, and will be re-reviewed by representatives of the City Council this morning before being sent directly to Mayor Wu for approval. In case the procedures are not completed in time, the implementation may be delayed until tomorrow. Among the public utilities, the telephone price has increased the most, reaching 98%, while water, electricity, and gas have increased by an average of about 60%.</p>
<p>It is reported that the new prices of public utilities were originally scheduled to be implemented from tomorrow (the 10th), but at a discussion meeting held by the Public Utilities Bureau the day before yesterday, the persons in charge of various companies repeatedly stated that they could not bear the burden and requested that the implementation be advanced by one day to today. The new prices were specially submitted to the mayor for review overnight yesterday. Detailed prices may be announced today. It is reported that the water, electricity, and gas companies have requested an increase of nearly 100%, while the telephone company has requested an increase of 144% due to the extremely high increase in the metal index in March. This was reduced only after repeated efforts by the representatives of the City Council.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper] The Public Utilities Committee of the City Council held its 24th meeting yesterday afternoon to discuss the high prices of public utilities. After a temporary motion: (1) Shao Yongsheng proposed: Request Chairman Pan to immediately request the Central Government to adopt the Council's recommendations regarding the impact of foreign exchange and coal price increases on public utility prices, which have risen sharply this month, for advance foreign exchange settlement for three months for the equipment and fuel needed for public utilities, or direct subsidies from the Central Government, and also freeze the price of coal used for public utilities, so that prices can be stabilized. Resolution: Approved as proposed. (2) Jiang Hao proposed: The telephone calculation formula has some improprieties. It is proposed to ask the Public Utilities Investigation Committee to study and revise it. Resolution: Approved as proposed.</p>
<p>Principles of the Contract Agreed Upon with the French Tram and Electric Light Company</p>
<p>In addition, at the Public Utilities Committee meeting, regarding (A) "The Municipal Government's letter on the principles for handling the contract with the French Tram and Electric Light Company for operating water, electricity, and transportation businesses, please review," it was resolved to agree in principle and reply for reference. The principles set by the Municipal Government are excerpted as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Regarding the electricity business, it is permitted to continue operating, but any aspects that do not meet China's electricity standards should be ordered to gradually improve them. In the future, when the Shanghai United Power Company is established, it may join as a participating company. (2) Regarding the transportation business, in order to facilitate the implementation of the urban transportation plan, the company should relinquish its exclusive franchise, but the current operating routes may be allowed to maintain the status quo, and further plans will be made after the entire plan is implemented. In the future, when the urban transportation company is established, the company may participate with priority or unify in other ways. (3) Regarding the water supply business, it is permitted to continue operating. In the future, if there is a unified Shanghai water supply business being planned, the company may participate in the organization. (4) Regarding the above three principles, the Municipal Government should establish a memorandum of understanding with the company to exchange documents in order to maintain credibility.</p>
<p>(B) "According to the Shanghai Ferry Industry Vocational Association's request to forward a letter to the Public Utilities Bureau to maintain the existing business of Dongjiadu, please review," it was resolved to ask the Public Utilities Bureau to handle it at its discretion. (C) Re-election of conveners, still recommending Councilors Wang Zhuyi, Jiang Hao, and Tang Chengzong to serve. (D) Recommend three conveners to participate in the Resolution Review Committee. (E) Recommend Zhu Kaiguan to attend the Public Utilities Investigation Committee meeting.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper] The memorial service for Legislator and Editor-in-Chief of this newspaper, Ye Qiuyuan, was originally scheduled for the 11th of this month. Due to the National Assembly meeting, relatives and friends were unable to attend, and many sent letters hoping to postpone it.

<p>[Our Newspaper] The authorities are considering rationing coal briquettes based on population. The People's Food Allocation Committee convened a meeting with mechanical coal briquette merchants on the 7th to discuss this matter. Because it is necessary to first investigate the production capacity of each factory, the distribution situation of retailers, and the composition of coal briquettes, it was decided that the association will compile a list and report it in the coming days, and then make concrete preparations. The original plan was to calculate the rationing quantity based on households, but now, considering that some households have dozens of people while others have only one person, it will be changed to a daily unit. For April, only industrial workers will be rationed coal. Applications from various factories were closed on April 5th, totaling more than 2,000 units. After approval, they can be distributed in the latter half of this month.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper] The Tianping ship of the China Shipping Company loaded with salt from the Zhongxing Wharf in Bailianjing yesterday, and was en route to Jiujiang Hankou. When sailing to the Pujiang surface of the 9th wharf of the China Merchants Bureau in Laobaidu, a number of sailing ships and small wheel ships came head-on. It was 11:45, the tide was high and the current was fast. The ship saw several ships heading downstream quickly and, fearing a tragedy, urgently avoided them to the right. The hull leaned towards the 9th wharf of the China Merchants Bureau in Pudong. The Jianghan transport, No. 311 of the Min, No. 107 of the Zhong, and No. 102 of the oil barge, four wheels, were docked next to the wharf. The Tianping ship rubbed against the four wheels, all of which were damaged. Two floating bridges of the wharf were also damaged, and the pump support wood was broken. After the accident, the Tianping ship stopped exporting. Captain He Xiaowu, together with the wharf manager, inspected the damage to the wharf and each ship, and reported to the general office. The iron railing on the Tianban of the Jianghan ship was bent, and an iron gate was broken, but it did not affect the voyage. Because it was also loaded with salt and needed to be shipped to Wuhan urgently, it was anchored and exported as usual at about 2:00 PM yesterday afternoon. The damaged parts will be directly negotiated by the two companies.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper] The Shanghai Academy of Fine Arts on Shunchang Road rented the empty houses behind No. 127, Du Shenfu Road, to Tang Zhaolai, the owner of Jintai Paper Bank, during the Anti-Japanese War. Tang sublet the remaining houses to more than ten tenants, including Yang Binghui, Zhou Jifu, and Tang Zhaolian. After the victory, the school was reopened and planned to take back the houses for its own use. Several lawsuits have been filed, but the dispute has not yet been resolved. Suddenly, at about 2:00 PM yesterday afternoon, the tenants were cut off from water and electricity. While they were panicking, more than 200 students from the US Special School rushed into the tenants' homes and destroyed the furniture. At that time, dozens of students from the nearby Huxing Middle School stepped forward to reason with the students from the US Special School. They disagreed and fought each other. The Huxing side was outnumbered, and several students were injured. They were later taken to the hospital for treatment by a teacher.

<h3 id="e64">Rice Rationing for Four Months Fully Secured; Surplus Grain to Be Sold in the Market Separately <a href="#e64" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c64" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">64</a></h3>
<p>[Our Reporter] Ren Xianqun, Director of the Food Distribution Committee, told reporters yesterday: (1) The rice quantity for rationing in this city for March, April, May, and June of this year, calculated generously at 500,000 shi per month, totaling 2 million shi, has been fully secured. In addition, 90,000 shi were transferred to the Nanjing Municipal Government. Due to weather conditions, the remaining surplus rice will be supplied to the market to prevent spoilage. When this stored rice was supplied to the North City Market yesterday, no one purchased it, while the South City Market sold over 300 shi. (2) Rationing must not be stopped during the lean months of July, August, and September. Wu Kaixian, Director of the Social Affairs Bureau, after traveling to Nanjing last week to make contact, has secured a solution for the rice source. After the passage of the US Aid to China Act, a large amount of American rice will continue to be shipped to China, and part of it will be used to continue rationing in Shanghai. (3) To avoid the reverse flow of rice from this city to the producing areas, he and Director Wu drafted a plan to purchase rice arriving at the port and submitted it to Mayor Wu for approval. The primary premise of this purchase plan is to avoid stimulating grain prices. It is currently being reviewed by Mayor Wu and has not yet been decided. If implemented perfectly, it can make the city's grain reserves exceed those before the war, providing a good indirect way to stabilize grain prices.</p>

<h3 id="e68">Fishing Industry Strike Stalled: Sailors Strike on the Fourth Day; Fresh Fish Prices Rise by 30% <a href="#e68" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c68" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">68</a></h3>
<p>The strike by sailors in the private fishing vessel industry is at a standstill. Yesterday was the fourth day of the strike, and fresh fish prices have already risen by about 30%. Although the Garrison Headquarters and the Seamen's Union continued mediation, the issue remained unresolved by evening. More than 20 fishing vessels and over 300 sailors are on strike. It remains questionable whether fishing vessels returning from fishing will also be drawn into the vortex. People in the fishing industry are anxious about this unfortunate incident, and they unanimously accuse the Fishing Management Office's dumping and preferential treatment as the main causes of the strike.</p>
<h3 id="e69">Director of the Fishing Management Office Discusses Treatment Issues <a href="#e69" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c69" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">69</a></h3>
<p>[Our Reporter] Zhao Junmai, Director of the Fishing Management Office of the Post-War Relief Committee, told reporters yesterday that the office is reducing staff every month to tighten expenses, having already cut over 400 employees in recent months. Another 40 or so employees will be laid off this month. As for the rumors that the Fishing Management Office's sailors receive particularly good treatment, Director Zhao said that the captains with the highest fishing capacity do have substantial income, which is true, but only during the fishing season (about two months).</p>
<p>Supplies Only for Fishing Vessels; No Salaries</p>
<p>It is understood that the treatment system for sailors at the Fishing Management Office has long been improved since Zhao took office, meaning that they do not receive any salaries or bonuses, only supplies for fishing vessels. All tools such as fishing nets and fuel for fishing vessels must be provided by the captain, and any damage to the machinery on board must also be compensated. For example, each fishing vessel spends about 400 million yuan on each fishing trip (about two or three weeks each time). If they only catch 30,000 catties of fish, the captain will lose money. Because the Fishing Management Office takes 40% to 60% of the proceeds from the sale of fish by the vessel, depending on the performance. If a vessel earns 1.4 billion yuan from the sale of fish after each trip, deducting the 400 million yuan in expenses, the Fishing Management Office gets 600 million yuan, and the captain is left with only 400 million yuan. This 400 million yuan must be divided among the ten or so crew members, because the crew members also do not receive salaries. Currently, the best performers can catch over 100,000 catties of fish each time, but there are two months each year when no fish can be caught, at which time the fishermen get nothing. Zhao continued that this system encourages sailors to work hard and also makes them cherish public vessels.</p>
<p>Fresh Fish Made into Dried Fish; Daily Production of 10,000 Catties</p>
<p>In addition, the office's work of using fresh fish to make salted dried fish began two weeks ago, with a daily production of 10,000 catties. It is currently being packaged and crated, and will be transported to the interior for supply in the future. The fresh fish is purchased from Chinese sailors at 15,000 yuan per catty. This work is still in its initial stages, and the office will gradually expand its equipment and make canned fish itself in the future.</p>
<h3 id="e70">Killing Without Blinking an Eye, What Talk of Friendship? Countless Atrocities Committed in Chongming; Two War Criminals Executed Simultaneously; Nakano and Oba Requested to Write Letters and Smoke Before Execution <a href="#e70" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c70" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">70</a></h3>
<p>[Our Reporter] Nakano Hisao, the former head of the Special High Division of the Chongming Gendarmerie, who once escaped from prison, was sentenced to death by the military court and approved by the Chairman. He was executed by firing squad at Tilanqiao Prison yesterday at noon together with Oba Hayato, the captain of the Chongming Gendarmerie, who was also sentenced to death. During their tenure in the Chongming Gendarmerie, Oba Hayato and Nakano Hisao specialized in capturing and killing our guerrillas. Their method of killing was to tie a huge stone to the person and throw them into the sea, and countless people were victimized. After the victory, the two criminals were reported by the family members of the victims, Huang Zifang, etc., and interrogated by the military court. In November of last year, the military judge of the court was sent to Chongming for an on-site investigation. At that time, the family members of the victims complained so much that the road was blocked. The military judge also found many corpses buried on the seashore. Based on confirmed evidence, Oba Hayato was sentenced to death. Nakano Hisao, knowing that he could not escape the law, escaped from prison before the military court's scheduled verdict. Later, he disguised himself and pushed a tricycle at the Zhabu Road bridgehead. He was finally arrested by the authorities and sentenced to death.</p>
<p>Wang Jiamai, the chief prosecutor of the military court, Wang Renming, the interpreter, Wang Chengshenghua, the clerk, and a platoon of armed military police went to Tilanqiao Shanghai Prison at 11:00 AM to bring up Oba and Nakano. After asking their names, ages, and places of origin, Chief Prosecutor Wang stood up and read the approved judgment issued by the Ministry of National Defense and asked if they had anything to say. Nakano was unrepentant until his death, still claiming to be innocent, and falsely claiming, "I hope to promote Sino-Japanese friendship with my sacrifice." Oba said, "I also hope for Sino-Japanese friendship and hope that the court will go to Chongming again to investigate the truth." The prosecutor immediately rebuked, "The evidence in this case is very conclusive and there is no need for further investigation. This death sentence is to punish you for your past crimes of killing, arson, and disregard for humanity in China. As for whether Sino-Japanese friendship will exist, it is a matter of future diplomatic relations and does not need to be discussed by you." The two criminals then requested to write a will and smoke cigarettes. The prosecutor granted their request and gave each of them two cigarettes. The two criminals then wrote several wills at their desks. After writing, they were tied to the execution ground and executed by military police. Oba Hayato was shot once, and Nakano Hisao was shot twice, and they died on the spot. After the corpses were verified to be correct, they were covered with white cloth and taken away by the Japanese Liaison Group for burial.</p>

<h3 id="e72">Rice Prices Reach New High; People's Livelihood Adjustment Committee Says Stimulated by Transportation Costs and Foreign Exchange <a href="#e72" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c72" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">72</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the rice market hit a new high price since spring. Special white japonica rice once broke out of the four million mark, shouting a price of 4.03 million yuan. Later, as a large amount of goods arrived in the market, customers took advantage of the high price to sell slightly, and the price fell slightly, closing near the border, at 4 million yuan, and then rising by 100,000 yuan. Transactions outside the market after closing still hovered around the 4.1-4.2 million mark. In addition, superior thin rice was priced at 4 million yuan, and early rice opened at 3.9 million yuan, both up 100,000 yuan. Yangxian rice prices were slightly flat, at 3.8 million yuan. Baiyuan rice was 3.9 million yuan, and brown japonica rice was 3.4 million yuan. The South City Market also had a strong appetite from all sides, and prices soared by 150,000 yuan at the opening. The Shen City market, due to rice distribution by the Market Management Committee, once retreated by 50,000 yuan, but then rose again, leveling with the opening price. White japonica rice and thin rice were each priced at 3.9 million yuan. To meet market needs, the People's Livelihood Adjustment Committee began selling rice at the market price in both the North and South markets yesterday, but because the North City market's actual sales were sluggish, no sales were made, and only 382.5 shi were sold in the South City market.</p>
<p>In response to the sharp rise in rice prices in recent days, the People's Livelihood Adjustment Committee issued the following statement yesterday: To replenish the city's food reserves and restore the average pre-war food stock of 500,000 to 1 million bags, to stabilize grain prices in the long term, the People's Livelihood Adjustment Committee of the Social Affairs Bureau formulated a method to purchase the remaining rice after the market closes. As soon as the municipal government approves it, representatives from relevant agencies will be convened for consultation, still aiming not to stimulate grain prices. This will enable rice merchants to purchase more from the production area after selling. The committee also analyzed the reasons for the recent rise in rice prices, stating that the 15% increase in rice prices in the past three days was due to the stimulation of high transportation costs and rising foreign exchange rates.</p>
<p>Flour: Soaring, with naval vessel flour opening at 1.495 million and old car flour opening at 1.5 million, both rising by 35,000 to 40,000 yuan. As a result, naval vessel flour closed at 1.49 million, up 30,000 yuan, and old car flour closed at 1.51 million, the same as peacock flour, up 50,000 yuan. Wheat bran added 50,000 yuan, and public wheat opened at 2.2 million, up 200,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Miscellaneous Grains: Soybeans are rising sharply under strong demand from oil mills. Hankou Zha beans rose from 1.9 million to 2 million, the same as car beans, up 100,000 yuan. High-grade corn was relatively actively sold, up 100,000 yuan, while medium and lower-grade corn remained stable. Raw peanuts rose by 150,000 to 200,000 yuan, mung beans added 100,000 yuan, red sorghum rose 50,000 yuan, and single-picked green beans fell by 20,000 yuan due to the imminent arrival of new goods on the market. Sesame rose by 100,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Edible Oil: New high prices are emerging one after another. Jibot barrel raw oil reached 9.7 million, breaking previous records, jumping up 300,000 yuan. The factory's soybean oil once reached 8.4 million, and in the end, Dayouyu soybean oil closed at 8.28 million, up 280,000 yuan. Raw sesame oil rose by 200,000 yuan, old barrel cooked vegetable oil rose by 500,000 yuan, and clear oil rose by 400,000 yuan. Sales orders for soybean cakes have arrived, and various cakes want to reach the million-dollar mark, with the market adding another 50,000 yuan today.</p>

It has recently been heard that the Shandong Provincial Government has complied with the Executive Yuan's telegram order, approving the release of the previously borrowed 3,000 bales of cotton stored by the Textile Construction Company. The committee informed the Textile Construction Company yesterday.</p>
<p>(2) From this month to the end of the year, the estimated national demand for raw cotton is 6 million dan (a unit of weight). The committee claims that the supply should pose no problem, as the current cotton stock of various factories, the Indian cotton exchanged by the Foreign Trade Committee, and the raw cotton arriving in port with self-provided foreign exchange amount to 3.2 million zu (another unit of weight). At the same time, the committee has received 400,000 dan in various regions, and another 600,000 zu can be collected, totaling 1 million dan. In addition, there are 100,000 bales of American loan cotton, equivalent to 1.8 million zu, totaling 6 million dan.</p>

It has now decided to sign an agreement with China National Aviation Corporation (CNAC) and Central Transportation Company to have CNAC transport the cotton directly to Shanghai by air, with an initial batch of 200 tons. The Central Transportation Company will transport an initial batch of 1,000 tons from Xi'an to Baoji by train, and then by truck via Chongqing to Shanghai. The above 1,200 tons of raw cotton can be transported within two months. If it proceeds smoothly, it will continue to be handled.</p>

<p>[Report from this newspaper, Nanjing, 8th] The Beijing newspapers recently filed a written protest to the Ministry of Education and the National Games Organizing Committee regarding the issues of interviewing news and taking photos at the National Games.

<p>According to Wang Xinheng, vice chairman of the Qingbai Sports Association: "The football team for our country's participation in the World Games has been formed, and only four people from Shanghai have been selected, which is extremely unfair. It is even more regrettable that Wu Qixiang was not selected. Wu's right back position is not only the best in the country, but also the best in the Far East. This is a consensus among people inside and outside the circle. I am not talking nonsense. The current right back who was selected is Hou Rongsheng. Hou's skills are good, but he is still one level behind Wu. Hou can still be listed as an official representative, but Wu's name is not on the list. How can this be considered fair? Regarding this point, I don't know how the selectors can justify themselves."</p>

It is reported that the students of the Chemistry Department of the school initiated a spring break trip to Hangzhou, and as a result, dozens of people registered to go, and returned to school from Hangzhou on the afternoon of the 6th. The other day, there was a notice in the school criticizing the students who traveled to Hangzhou for holding a meeting with students from Zhejiang University to discuss the current situation, and there was a certain conspiracy. This notice aroused the resentment of the students who traveled to Hangzhou, and they submitted a defense at 11:00 am today. When they were about to post the defense notice, some students blocked it, which led to a brawl. As a result, one person was injured and was sent to the hospital for treatment.

<h3 id="e108">Neurosis <a href="#e108" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c108" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">108</a></h3>
<p>— Jingwen</p>
<p>These few days, the newspapers are full of news about neurotics, which makes people laugh, although the parties do not admit that they are neurotic, and even accuse others of being neurotic. However, one claims to be some kind of Lord, advocating the banning of revolutionary parties and even gigolos from various countries, and the other asks the court to appraise others as having a mental illness out of thin air. Regardless of whether these behaviors are out of momentary playfulness, there is no doubt that their spirit lacks health. Because a mentally normal person will never have such absurd words and deeds, even if it is to find pleasure and prank, there is probably a range. Although I dare not say that they are definitely suffering from mental illness, it is probably not wrong to say that they are mentally disturbed (even if it is occasional).</p>
<p>According to the opinions of psychoanalysts, eight or nine out of ten people living in modern cities suffer from mental disorders, only the degree is light or heavy, and the time is long or short, and because they sympathize with each other, everyone is not easy to detect. For example, hysteria was once thought to be only a disease that women would commit, but now we know that both men and women are the same. Especially in speculative places, if you can observe coldly, almost everyone is suffering from varying degrees of hysteria. Just think of the scene of impermanent joy, anger, sorrow, and happiness, isn't it the most powerful evidence?</p>
<p>The nerve endurance of people is originally limited, but the stimulation in urban social life is endless. Not to mention anything else, we only need to open the newspaper every day, and we don't know how much news is enough to hurt our brains. The fighting on the international stage, the fighting on the battlefield, as well as the yellow, pink, and gray social news, and economic news that directly affects life, etc., which one does not make people feel mental stimulation.</p>
<p>Some people may think that the more dynamic and complex social life is, the more it indicates the richness and vitality of human life. For example, children who grow up in cities are much smarter and more lively than children in rural areas. Adults in cities look younger than men and women in the countryside of similar age. Men in their forties still have a slicked-back hair, and mothers with four or five children, relying on the superb skills of makeup, can be sisters with their children.</p>
<p>These are indeed facts, at least they seem to be so in appearance. Because a tense and changeable life does have the feeling of rejuvenation in the spirit. In highly urbanized societies such as the United Kingdom and the United States, some people have proposed that life begins at forty or even seventy. However, it is also an undeniable fact that there are far more people with neurosis in urban societies than in rural areas.</p>
<p>However, although urban life easily makes people suffer from neurasthenia, it is not without a cure. If everyone can see the meaning of life more clearly and see everything more naturally, then although urban life is tense, your mind can still maintain a considerable amount of tranquility, and naturally it will not cause mental disorders. Because the tension and stimulation of urban life are just man-made things. We often see many people rushing around all day long, walking like they are rushing to a funeral, eating without tasting the taste, looking at their watches every few minutes, almost smashing the phone when the phone doesn't work, and rushing across the road when the red light is on, and rushing on the tram is like charging into battle. These people's lives are really terrible. But is he really doing something extraordinary? Ninety-nine percent may not be. They are just because they have been tormenting their nerves in a tense atmosphere for a long time, so any sesame-sized thing, he can't help but deal with it with a tense attitude.</p>
<p>I am not saying that there is absolutely nothing in life that requires concentrating all one's attention on. Now is the scientific world, and most of the work requires the correct time coordination, so it is sometimes necessary to be nervous. However, before mankind was baptized by scientific civilization, they lived the same life for thousands of years, and it is still the case in rural societies today. The highest goal of scientific civilization was originally to improve people's lives and well-being. It is the result of human creation, so it should still be controlled by people. If you are controlled by it instead, you will inevitably become a victim of scientific civilization. All people with neurasthenia, if they can understand how to use a natural attitude to control scientific civilization and urban life, I dare to guarantee that he can recover in no time.</p>
<h3 id="e109">Serious <a href="#e109" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c109" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">109</a></h3>
<p>— Why Bother</p>
<p>During this period, we often see a familiar word in newspapers: "Serious." For example, "The situation is serious," "a serious expression," and so on. If the frequent appearance of the word "serious" in newspapers is not a blessing for the people, it is not an exaggeration. Because ordinary people like to live a peaceful and easy life, and they are most afraid of seriousness and difficulty. Once something becomes serious, there must be difficulties. If "smiles" could come with "seriousness," wouldn't that be wonderful? However, this is just talking to oneself behind closed doors. Not everything can go as one wishes, which is why "seriousness" causes living beings to frown.</p>
<p>However, half of the serious things in the world are due to the awkwardness of the situation itself, and the other half is caused by the subjective state of mind. Let's start from a small perspective: I pride myself on having calculation skills, so even a small expense like a pack of cigarettes must be recorded in my daily accounts. Many people have long denied the usefulness of keeping petty cash accounts. In the past, people kept petty cash accounts in order to achieve balance in their expenses, with the intention of living within their means. Since large banknotes appeared and savings disappeared, keeping petty cash accounts has become even more of an outdated practice. I am determined to stick to it, not because I am clinging to the past and not open-minded enough, but because I have high self-esteem and want to start from small things. However, this petty cash account, although recorded every day, is often inaccurate. Today, it might be tens of thousands of yuan too much, and yesterday, it might be fifty thousand yuan too little. Sometimes, because the numbers are inaccurate, I bury myself in thought, trying to recover a forgotten expense from my thoughts. The suffering is not different from that of a great scientist brainstorming for a difficult equation. And the outward seriousness often surprises an uninvited friend: "What's wrong, old friend? Why are you so serious in deep thought?" A friend can't help but think that way.</p>
<p>In fact, what's so serious about it when you think it through? If the account is inaccurate, forget it. A difference of tens of thousands of yuan is just personal petty cash, not embezzlement of public funds, so there's no need to think so hard. It is said that the founder of "pushing and knocking" spent three years considering whether to use "the monk knocks on the moonlit gate" or "a monk pushes on the moonlit gate." So when he later decided to use "the monk knocks on the moonlit gate," he wrote four more lines: "Two lines took three years to get, one chant brings double tears, if the connoisseur does not understand, I will return to my old mountain in autumn." He took his own writings so seriously. However, this is the eternal chanting of a great poet, and it is worth taking seriously. What is my petty cash account? Why bother frowning and thinking hard for a mere tens of thousands of yuan, unable to understand myself? Even utilitarians would probably sneer at me for not thinking so hard for these insignificant sums.</p>
<p>Therefore, when it comes to seriousness, one must be able to see things openly. The one who ties the bell must untie it. Many major events are just petty cash accounts under a magnifying glass. If you can see things openly, it won't be serious. As for matters that are inherently serious, please forgive me for not daring to discuss them, as they involve major plans and cannot be "easily resolved" with nonsensical talk.</p>
<h3 id="e110">Anecdotes of Zhang Taiyan <a href="#e110" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c110" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">110</a></h3>
<p>— Qian Dacheng</p>
<p>Zhang Taiyan was a revolutionary literary master and a great scholar of his time, known as "Zhang the Madman." His anecdotes are scattered among the people, but the records in Qian Jibo's "History of Modern Chinese Literature" are the most detailed. Mr. Jin Shuyuan, from the same village, once worked with Taiyan at Soochow University in the late Qing Dynasty. He recounted his anecdotes, which were not known to the public, so I wrote them down in this article:</p>
<p>Taiyan was devoted to scholarship and did not understand worldly affairs. Among his colleagues, he only praised Huang Moses from Changshu as someone he could discuss scholarship with, and he would talk to him incessantly all night long. Others did not understand what the two of them were talking about. Moses was also a remarkable person, and I will write about him in another article. Taiyan once said: "Scholars must have a brain disease to achieve success in scholarship; I also have a brain disease."</p>
<p>When Taiyan was in Suzhou, he had already cut off his queue, which made people stare at him, so he wore a fake queue on his hat, but he did not sew it onto the hat, but rather embedded it inside the hat. Whenever he went to the market street, the fake queue often fell to the ground, which made people stare at him even more. He also did not know the way, and he often got lost from Tianci Village to Guanqian. The colleagues bet with each other, saying: "If Taiyan can go from Tianci Village to Guanqian without getting lost and without dropping his queue, we will treat him to a sumptuous feast." In the end, no one dared to make this bet. It is said that when he was in Shanghai, he also got lost and could not find his way home. He went to ask a police officer, saying: "Where is my home?" The police officer found it strange. He became furious and said: "Don't you even know where my home is?" So he was taken to the police station, and after asking his name, he was sent home.</p>
<p>Taiyan did not pay much attention to washing and bathing. His hair grew several inches long, and he did not know how to groom himself. His colleague Zhu would tell him every month or so: "It's time to get a haircut." He would say: "Okay." Then he would get a haircut, and Zhu would pay for the haircut. This happened many times. One day, he suddenly said to Mr. Shuyuan: "Is his surname Zhu?" Shuyuan laughed and said: "He has paid for your haircuts many times, and you still don't recognize him?"</p>
<p>Years ago, when I was in Wuxi, I heard Taiyan give a lecture. He was calm and composed, with a slightly nasal voice. He kept smoking cigarettes while lecturing. Once, he wanted to stand up and write on the blackboard, but he mistook the cigarette for a piece of chalk. After writing and sitting down to lecture again, he mistook the chalk for a cigarette and put it in his mouth to smoke. The audience couldn't help but burst into laughter.</p>
<h3 id="e111">My Fantasy <a href="#e111" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c111" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">111</a></h3>
<p>— Cicada</p>
<p>Although the post-war world is still filled with the smell of gunpowder, most war-weary people have shifted their interests from war to other things.</p>
<p>Today, besides the war, the most attention-grabbing thing should be the upcoming World Games. According to my estimation, there are probably more people who care about the World Games than those who care about the current situation. In fact, this is a welcome phenomenon.</p>
<p>War is nothing more than a measurement of strength between countries. However, it inevitably involves countless innocent people and many beautiful towns being reduced to ashes in the flames of war. From a purely humanitarian point of view, war should indeed be abolished. However, when two countries negotiate to the point of blushing faces and their interests clash to the point where they can only be resolved by force, there is no other way to follow but to fight to the death.</p>
<p>However, is war the only way to measure the strength between two countries? No! There is also sports. From sports, one can see the physical strength of a country's people and a country's true strength. Then the upcoming World Games is almost equivalent to a world war, and the honor and disgrace of each country can be judged here. Being able to dominate the World Games is truly a strong country. All strong countries should have healthy citizens. Don't we often shout that a strong country must first have a strong race?</p>
<p>If future international conflicts—no matter what they are for—are not resolved by war, but by sports competitions, that would be the greatest blessing for mankind! Unfortunately, it is just my fantasy.</p>

<p>Two occasional rhymes</p>
<p>Green bamboo hat, green bamboo raincoat, an old fisherman comes home to cast his fishing rod. Coming home unaware of the rising west wind, ten thousand miles of long sky a wild goose flies.</p>
<p>On the desolate river, there are many tigers and wolves. Heaven and earth are closed, what can be done. The virtuous men are hidden, the gentlemen's way is gone, the setting sun suddenly goes to the Central Plains, where does the sad wind roll the evening tide!</p>
<p>Waking up</p>
<p>Waking up, a dream sunk leisurely, no place to find a confidant on the desolate road. Usually, I only embrace the habit of watching mountains, today only the remaining heart of carving sentences. The day is long, often because the birds are silent, the path is secluded, more lining the falling flowers deep. In the midst of chaos, there is still the interest of the righteous emperor, forgetting everything, a light and distant mind</p>

<p>Chapter 14 Carefree on the Sea (2)</p>
<p>Zhu Zhai had already prepared many words in his heart while on the carriage, how he should speak to Yunqing, how he should plead with her if she did not agree, and make her speechless, and she would surely agree to me. Although Fengsheng's expression today is annoying, if things take a turn for the better because of this, then a blessing in disguise. I think this time, there will definitely be a result. Zhu Zhai was thinking on the way, and when the carriage arrived at the door, he rang the doorbell. Auntie Li came out to open the door, and when she saw it was Zhu Zhai, she first said: "Miss has gone to Tianjin." Zhu Zhai couldn't help but be stunned and said: "When did she go to Tianjin?" Auntie Li said: "Didn't she send you a letter?" Zhu Zhai said: "I didn't receive her letter." As he spoke, he walked straight upstairs, not really believing it in his heart, and felt that Auntie Li's words might not be reliable. Upstairs, he walked straight into Yunqing's bedroom. He saw that the furnishings in the room were still the same, only the bedding on the bed and the books on the desk had all been packed away. When he looked at the photograph under the glass on the table, it was also gone. He knew that Yunqing had indeed gone to Tianjin, and this trip would not be a short one. He sighed deeply and asked, "Did Miss say when she would be back?" Auntie Li said: "She didn't say. She took a lot of clothes with her this time when she went to Tianjin, so she probably won't be back soon!" Zhu Zhai nodded and looked around the room. Although everything was the same, the house felt desolate with the person gone. He felt very sad in his heart. When he saw Auntie Li looking at him blankly, he had to say, "I didn't expect Miss to go to Tianjin too." Auntie Li said: "If you have anything to say, you can write a letter to our Miss. Tianjin is not far from here, you can go to Tianjin to find her." Zhu Zhai reluctantly responded and walked to the door. Auntie Li knew that he was sad and said, "I'll call you and tell you when Miss returns." Zhu Zhai nodded, got into the carriage, and felt so empty in his heart, as if he was falling into the sea, drifting in the midst of huge waves, not knowing where to drift. He really wanted to find a wilderness and cry loudly to feel better. At this moment, he had no attachment in his heart, so he ordered the driver to drive straight to the Wu Gongwei's house.</p>

<p>— Qinglei Academy</p>
<p>In the early years of the Qing Dynasty's Xuantong reign, there was an initial discussion about restoring the navy. The princes and nobles were in power. Prince Regent Zaifeng's younger brother, Zaixun, was young and enthusiastic. He went abroad to inspect the navy and, upon his return, began planning. Everything was vague and uncertain. He earnestly invited the old General Sa to jointly plan, and after some progress, the Ministry of Navy was established, with Zaixun as the minister (i.e., the head) and Tan Xueheng as the vice minister. However, there was no suitable position for old Sa in the capital. He was appointed as the commander-in-chief of the fleet, which was a good system, but it was an external appointment. In the early years of the Republic of China, old Yuan relied on his military strength to support his regime, and he trusted Mr. Liu Guanxiong, appointing him as the Minister of Navy. He respected old Sa's detached style, but kept him at a distance. When Yuan died and Li succeeded him, Cheng Fengguang became the Minister of Navy, and old Sa still did not have any power over military affairs. His relationship with the political situation and the navy was always vague and distant. However, when people talked about the navy's veteran, no one did not mention Sa Zhenbing. The public's respect for him was due to historical reasons.</p>
<p>In the autumn of the year before the founding of the Republic of China, the Wuchang Revolutionary Army rose up, and Governor Rui Cheng fled, and the provincial capital fell. The Qing court was greatly shocked and urgently ordered Minister of the Army Yin Chang to lead two Zhen of the Beiyang Army to the south, and also ordered Sa Zhenbing to lead the Yangtze River Fleet to advance by land and water. Old Sa and Li Yuanhong had a teacher-student relationship. Old Li gave old Sa a letter, earnestly stating the great righteousness. Old Sa's attitude was not very active, and at this point, he absolutely refused to confront the Revolutionary Army. On the army side, the command shifted from Yin Chang to old Yuan. Old Yuan had other plans in his mind. When the Qing Dynasty abdicated and the Republic of China was established, some people recommended old Sa, but old Yuan said that good people were useless, so he gave the navy's power to Liu Guanxiong. Mr. Liu helped old Yuan with all his might, and his personal wealth also greatly relied on old Yuan's support. Liu and Sa's calm and quiet styles were completely different.</p>
<p>In the "Biographies of Contemporary Celebrities" (written by Ward, published in Shanghai in the past), Sa Zhenbing is described as "simple and frugal, morally upright and clean, riding in a rickshaw without escorts, never speaking deceptive words in his life, but lacking in strength and decisiveness, so although he was appointed to an important position early on, his authority was not exercised." These words are all accurate. This is why he was a "strange military man" and a "lonely official." I remember that in the twenty-second year, the leaders of the 19th Route Army and some politicians in Fujian organized the so-called People's Government and divided the entire province into many districts, and they recommended old Sa as one of the provincial governors. From a distance, this could not be known in detail, but judging from his past style, he would definitely say yes, take office, and be indifferent, adapting to circumstances. This organization soon disintegrated, and old Sa's village scholar demeanor and old woman's face remained the same. He was "indifferent" and "unrelated."</p>
<p>"Biographies of Celebrities" also says: "His son returned from studying in the United States, and he hosted a banquet to treat him, and raised his glass and said: 'From now on, father and son will live separately and each govern themselves. This banquet is to bid you farewell and wish you self-reliance.' Those watching all covered their mouths." According to the fact that his son has returned to the country after completing his studies, it is the starting point for serving the country and society. Modern civilization is different from the old feudal system. People are citizens, not parasites of the family. Parents' education of their children has a certain limit. Children should support their parents, but they cannot be attached to them outside of the country and society. Sa Weng's actions were in line with reason and fact, but could not be understood by stubborn minds, so they covered their mouths and laughed. Judging from this incident alone, Sa Weng had his own ideas in his mind, that is, his naval knowledge and naval plans were also very skilled, but for all kinds of current positions, there were too many things that were like child's play, which could not be taken seriously, coupled with his peaceful nature, he was even more happy to perfunctorily deal with it. Sa Weng was certainly not a great hero, but there are often people who are truly promising, but are disdainful of reality and content with negativity.</p>

<h3 id="e117">Answers to Questions about Military Service (3) Written by the Third Section of the Shanghai Municipal Civil Affairs Bureau <a href="#e117" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c117" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">117</a></h3>
<p>(5) Regarding technicians: Any eligible draftees who want to use the reason of being a technician to postpone their service must submit their graduation certificate from a specialized school and their certificate of being a technical staff member of an institution or factory, or a technician certification, to apply for postponement of service. However, technical workers do not refer to the general term, but must be within the scope of applicable exemptions for specialized technical workers in national defense industries promulgated by the Executive Yuan to be considered qualified. This review is based on the registration certificate of technical workers from the Labor Bureau and the certificate of serving in a technical position in an institution or factory. Without the two types of certificates mentioned above, they cannot be recognized as meeting the regulations for technical workers related to national defense and cannot be granted exemptions.</p>
<p>(6) Regarding primary school teachers: Primary school teachers applying for deferment of service must submit their primary school teacher registration certificate and employment letter, and they must also be verified against the list qualified by the Education Bureau to be considered qualified. None of the applications for primary school teachers in this city in the 36th year submitted registration certificates, only school certificates, which are not in compliance with the law and must be supplemented.</p>
<p>(7) Regarding the provisions of Article 26, Paragraph 5 of the Military Service Law: Article 26, Paragraph 5 of the Military Service Law stipulates that "those who are solely responsible for the livelihood of their family and have no siblings, or have siblings who have all been conscripted or are all under the age of eighteen" may be granted deferment. The focus of this article is on the phrase "solely responsible for the livelihood of their family." If there are no draftees who are solely responsible for the livelihood of their family, even if they are the only son, they must still serve in the military. Conversely, even if there are several brothers, but the oldest of them is still under the age of eighteen, they can also apply for deferment. The Civil Affairs Bureau, seeing that the scope of this article was too broad, after considering the actual situation, formulated the Shanghai Municipal Standard for Solely Responsible for Family Livelihood as the basis for review. However, when reviewing this application, the most common phenomenon was that local Baojia chiefs could not know whether they actually had siblings and what the family's economic situation was. However, many were able to attach proof from the Baojia chief of their original residence or attach proof from the person in charge of the factory or firm, and we approved them. Because the majority of our people are in the poor class, as long as the father is over 58 years old, the younger brother is under 18 years old, and there are no other colleagues in production, they are all allowed to defer service. In addition, there are many draftees whose fathers and brothers are not yet up to the above-mentioned age, but because of illness or disability, they cannot produce, they are also considered to meet the standard of being solely responsible for the family livelihood and can be allowed deferment for the same reason.</p>
