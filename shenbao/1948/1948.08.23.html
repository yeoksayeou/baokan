<h3>總統勉勵全國同胞　協定政府安定經濟　奉行法令完成戡建大業</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿二日電〕總統以決心切實執行財經緊急處理辦法及肅淸國內奸匪潛伏份子，特就當前時局及政府重大措施發表談話，並由政院新聞局長董顯光於廿二日下午五時舉行記者招待會，即時宣布，希望全國新聞界協助宣導，以完成此一任務。又董局長在招待會上稱：總統原擬親自與記者們見面談話，惟旋因他事未果，此點足以表示總統對此之重視，招待會進行極速，董局長宣布總統談話後即行散會。</p>
<p>〔中央社南京廿二日電〕蔣總統頃就當前時局及政府重大措施，發表談話，全文如次：</p>
<p>在抗戰勝利之初，我全國同胞對於戰後經濟的復興與生活之改善，無不寄以熱烈的期望，中正尤汪重於國家建設計創的確立，與建設人才的培養，期與全國同胞共相奮勉，實現我們建國理想之三民主義。至今抗戰結束已經三年，如無奸匪共黨的叛變，我國國民的經濟生活和國家的建設事業，在安定的環境之中，早已獲得空前的進步，與民主各國共進於復興繁榮之境，但是，共黨奸匪處心積慮，危害我領土主權的完整，破環我國家統一獨立的基礎，毀滅我民族勝利光榮的歷史，和自由平等的地位，而乃倒行逆述，堅持其武裝暴動，殘忍慘殺的奸匪路綫，造成今日國土殘破，民生疾苦的現象。</p>
<p>現在共黨奸匪旣利用我戰後經濟殘破，軍民疲敝的弱點，發動全面叛亂，已達三年之久，但其暴力，經此長期叛亂，仍不能顚覆我國本，摧毁我民命，則今後更不能達成其出賣國家，奴役民族的目的。尤以最近一年間他以土革爲欺驅的口號，以淸算爲脅迫的手段，對匪區民衆的人力物力，作竭澤而漁的搜括，企岡對政府作最後的一逞。但是事實已證明共匪所謂「一年計劃」是失敗了。他的軍事冒險，旣沒有達到預期的目的，他的殘忍鬥爭，却已自食其果，匪區的飢荒是造成了，匪區的民心亦已醒悟起來，反抗奸匪了。於是奸匪不得不以政治攻勢掩蔽其根本失敗，乃在我後方煽動學校靑年，開闢其所謂「第二戰綫」，並策動外圍份子，發起其所謂「反戰求和」運動，以破壞我社會秩序，阻撓我戡亂動員，其中少數認識不淸，受匪煽惑，隨聲附和之徒，更將奸匪以殘忍屠殺和恐怖控制手段所造成的一切慘狀轉嫁其責任於政府，甚至責備政府製造內戰，殊不知今日政府的剿匪軍事，是爲保衛領土主權的完整而戰，爲維護獨立自由的地位而戰，在本質上，實爲繼續八年抗戰的民族戰爭，如果國家的統一獨立一日沒有完成，匪區同胞的苦痛茶毒一日沒有解除，則我愛國軍民剿匪戡亂的職賢，亦一日不能放棄。否則，全國同胞爲八年抗戰而流血犧牲所得的勝利戰果，不僅無法保特，而且整個國家民族要被奴役，永無翻身之日了。</p>
<h3>危害新幣信用　就是全民公敵　人民應起而糾正檢舉</h3>
<p>但是，政府並不因剿匪軍事的進行而放棄其建國的工作，當此長期抗戰之餘，奸匪全面叛亂之際，法幣漸進入惡性膨脹的階段，國計民生皆受到嚴重的威脅，政府乃不得不毅然決然改革幣制，此次金圓券的發行，經過了審愼的研討，籌集了充足的準備，確定了健全的制度，並整理財政，管理經濟，以保障幣制改革的圓滿實施，中正更持有堅定的信念與決心，以貫澈財政經濟緊急處分令所頒行的四項辦法，今後國家建設的進行與國民生活的安定，皆有賴於穩定的幣値與物價。凡我愛國同胞，自必對此新幣政策一致擁護，尤應澈底認識，這次幣制的改革不使是國家財政整理的張本，並且是人民生計安定的前提，須知政府爲全國人民自己的政府，而國家亦爲全國人民自己的國家，古人說：「皮之不存，毛將焉附」，在今日奸匪　張，國勢嚴重之時，人民·國家與政府三者，禍福榮辱，是密切相關，生死存亡，更決無二致。人民擁護國家的新幣，即所以安定其本身的生計，人民奉行政府的法令，亦即所以保障其本身的權利，深望我全國同胞，瞭解其對國家，對政府已成爲不可分之一體，因之，人民與政府，不只要互信互助，合作無間，而人氏與人民彼此之間，亦應互相規勸，共同勉勵，以全力擁護改革幣制的政策，澈底執行管制經濟的法令，如有少數人不顧大局，只圖私利，因襲法幣貶値時期的作風，操縱新幣，爲投機壟斷的工具，以危害其信用，那就是破壞我全國人民的生計，也就是我全國人民的公敵，政府自必依據國家總動員法令及刑事法規，視同賣國的奸匪，予以嚴厲的制裁。而人民亦當起而加以糾正和檢舉，協助政府，完成這一爲國爲民，安定經濟，保障民生的政策。過去十年，法幣制度已完成其支持抗戰建國的使命，深信今日以後，金幣制度亦必能助成建國的大業底於成功。</p>
<h3>煽惑青年陰謀　決不坐視蔓延</h3>
<p>勉恢復明廉知恥精神</p>
<p>建國工作，必有其物質的條伴，尤須有其精神的動力，大學爲建設人才的園地，更是建國精神的泉源，乃今日共黨奸匪在各地大學之內埋伏間諜，對學生靑年肆其煽惑，加以組織，犧牲其學業，毁滅其戡亂建國的理性，使其担任匪第的城市工作和匪軍的内綫，他們更在大學靑年思想上敢布毒素，以摧殘我民族歷史文化，並破壞建國人才所必具的國家意識和科學修養。政府對於這一斵喪我民族新生命的罪惡，決不能坐視其蔓延，國家在此財政艱難之中，猶竭盡全力，維持大學學生的公費，救濟匪區流亡的學生，愛護靑年，可謂備至。然對於接受奸匪指使危害國家社會的行爲，亦決不再事姑息，因此頒發命令，淸查共匪間諜，尤注意於淸除大學靑年中的陰謀活動份子，以保障學校的安全與青年的學業。</p>
<p>當此國家民族存亡榮辱之交，所望我全國同胞信任政府，遵行法令，建立良好健全的幣制，摒棄投機壟斷的行爲，戒除浪費，崇尙節約，保持我們中國勤勞儉樸傳統的美德，恢復我們民族明廉知恥之固有的精神，一面檢舉奸匪間諜，維持社會秩序，一面保障學校安全，愛惜靑年學業，如此戡亂建國同時並進，全國一致同心協力，實現三民主義，完成國民革命，乃得吿慰於我爲抗戰剿匪而犧牲的將士及革命先烈在天之靈。</p>
<h3>翁院長謁總統　報告當前情況</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿二日電〕行政院長翁文灝廿二日上午十時許復往北極閣晋謁總統，報吿財政經濟緊急處分令公佈後各種情况。翁氏晋謁總統前，財長王雲五曾往鄉琊路官邸晋謁翁氏，談約數十分鐘。又有關部會首長數人，亦曾於廿二日晨晋謁翁院長，有所請示。</p>
<h3>如有擅行加價者　移送特刑庭懲辦　翁院長再令各省市厲行</h3>
<p>〔中央社南京廿二日電〕翁院長文灝廿二日特再電各省市政府，嚴申各地各項物品價格概以八月十九日爲最高標準，如有故違，情節較重者應移送特種刑事法庭嚴加懲辦，原令如下：各省市政府：關於財政經濟緊急處分令，各省市政府當前最重要工作爲管制當地各項物品價格，槪以八月十九日爲最高標準，非經核准，不得擅自加價，違者除照規定逕予行政處分外，並應將情節較重者依戡亂時期危害國家緊急治罪條例，移送特種刑事法庭嚴加懲辦，以儆效尤，地方政府對此必須切實嚴厲執行，不容稍存瞻顧，並希將執行情形隨時其報爲要。</p>
<h3>傳美空中堡壘肉大隊　將自關島調駐青　修理城陽機塲供作軍用</h3>
<p>〔本報靑島二十日電〕美空中堡壘兩個中隊，將自關島調駐靑島，並經常訪問平津。此訊係由美方透露，並悉美軍事顧問團空軍組長司邁斟少將，前曾由平來此視察，與此有關。靑機塲刻正大事調整，現用之滄口機塲，離市區十八公里，面積過小，駐有美海軍陸戰隊戰鬥機一大隊，及若干海軍遝輸機，中國空軍兩個中隊，兼作民航機塲，已嫌擁擠不堪，今後將專供民用（包括民航大隊在內），業已荒廢之城陽機塲，離市區三十一公里，將專供中美軍用，該塲可容飛機三百架以上。滄口機塲接近海口，常爲霧氣侵擾，城陽則否，戰時日軍專闢爲軍用，修理工程最早在兩週後可完成。</p>
<h3>國營事業員工　待遇按新規定</h3>
<p>政院令取消逾限部份</p>
<p>〔中央社南京廿二日電〕政院頃通令直屬機構及有關各部會轉所屬國營事業，嚴格執行經濟管制辦法中規定之員工待遇標準，即每人實際所得，除較同級公務員所得最多得加三成外，其超過此限度部份並一律取消，原令如次：査財政經濟緊急處分令「整理財政及加强經濟管制辦法」第廿一條規定，國營事業員工之待遇，應依第十八·第十九·第二十各條之規定，改發金圓券，其每人實際所得，除照國營事業員工待遇辦法，較同級公務員所得最多得加三成外，其超過此限度之部份，一律取消，該辦法自本年八月二十日施行，所有各　國營事業員工之待遇，應自本年八月份起嚴格査照該條文規定辦理，不得藉口前此有反對案特准而延遲遵行，亦不得以任何名義有所變更，除分令外，合行令仰切實遵照辦理，並將辦理情形於文到後即日内旦復，除分令外，此令。</p>

<h3>呼籲雪冤　前駐暹宋卡領事　丘守愚招待記者</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿二日電〕我國前駐暹羅宋卡總領館領事丘守愚，廿二日在京招待記者。除報吿暹南僑情外，並呼籲與論界支持其沅雪此次被人陷害致受外部撤職四國處分之寃枉。丘氏爲我國有數之南洋問題專家，精通馬來語文，兼會閩粤方言，曾任外部專門委員，著作甚多。前年隨李迪後專使宣慰荷印時，貢獻殊偉。迨後外部在暹南宋卡設總領館，被派爲領事，隨總領事嚴萬里前往開館，襄贊一切，頗得當地僑胞之擁護信仰，丘氏學者本色，為人耿直，致遭他人嫌視。三月前外部接獲一假借宋卡僑團名義，模倣丘氏筆跡之函件。其中對嚴總領多有微詞，並推薦由丘氏任總領。外部竟被矇蔽，疑爲丘氏所爲，立令丘氏回國，丘氏回國後探知究竟，力隈其寃，並强調即渠至愚，亦不至親筆作書，毛遂自薦。豈可因一無頭函件即受此斷然處分？懇外部當局澈査此事。然經外部請內部警察總署刑事室鑒別筆跡，竟亦認係丘氏所書。丘氏以其獲罪於「莫須有」，名譽。事業兩受損傷，決向層峯申請，必要時並擬籲請監院澈査此事本末。丘氏末謂：渠將撰寫「旅暹觀感」，報道僑胞疾苦。</p>
<h3>運用美援棉花　中美將設執行機構共同辦理　棌購石油事正在商談</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿二日電〕美援運用委會及美經合總署駐華分署，定廿五日下午舉行第三次聯席會，關於賴樸翰提議運用美援棉花，由中·美雙方設一執行機構，共同辦理事，中美速日在滬商談已獲協議，廿五日會中即哥有所決定。又我國幣制改革後，美援記帳如何計算問題，廿五日亦可能提出討論，屆時並將由史蒂爾曼報吿返國之經過，賴樸翰已定於廿四日自靑返京出席。</p>
<p>〔本報南京廿二日電〕美援物資中之糧食及棉花，均有數批陸續運轉中國，惟石油因受美國公共法案第（七九三）條第（二〇二）節之影響，迄尙未能購運。該條中規定「凡在美國境外大量採購物資，其價格超過在美國境内採購傻格時，不得用美援款項」，美援物資中之石油，需在美國國境以外採購受上條之限制，故美經合署迄尙未將撥款書及授權採購書發下，致無法採購。中國現已與美方商談解決此項問題，希望兩週内獲得結果，此問題解決後，美援物資中之石油，即可開始採購啓運來華。</p>
<h3>實施自助計劃</h3>
<p>改革幣制即具體表現</p>
<p>〔本報南京廿二日電〕運用美援配合自助計劃之實施情形及具體實施辦法，我方原後於八月底以前提供美方參考，頃因我政府實施改革幣制，各部會均於執行新經濟揹施尙未能將其實施自助計劃情形及實施辦法提交美援會，故我方向美提出是項資料之時期或將略有延展，惟最遲九月初定可將此項資料提出。此次我國總統頒布之財政經濟緊急處分令，實施改革幣制，整理財政及加強管制經濟等辦法，即為實施自助計劃之具體表現。</p>
<h3>麥帥昨歡宴張羣　總統致麥帥函業經送達</h3>
<p>〔中央社東京廿二日電〕麥克阿瑟廿二日午設宴招待張羣，聞張氏於日本勾留三週中，可能再與麥氏會見一二次。據接近張氏人士稱：二人廿二日所談者，爲一般事項。又聞：張氏此後將與日本各方面領袖人物一一會談，廬田及片山均表示願與張氏晤面。廿二日午宴前，張氏由商震將軍，吳文稿藥及邵　　陪同驅軍拜訪麥克阿瑟，麥氏當表示歡迎之意，午後一時半開始入席，由麥夫人負責招待商震失婦及邵　麟均在座，至三時半方散。</p>
<p>〔又電〕我國前行政院長張羣此次訪日，曾携來蔣總統致麥克阿瑟元帥之私人函件。張氏於昨日下午抵此後，即已將該函交由我國代表團送達麥帥。</p>
<p>〔又電〕前行政院長張羣今晨在此間中國駐日代表團團長官邸，接見中國記者。渠力稱：日本境內近時對其此次訪日任務之推測，與事實不符。重申此次係以「私人地位」訪問，並未負有「任何官方使命」。</p>

<h3>看今天上海的物價　——讀蔣總統談話之後——</h3>
<p>政府於本月十九日頌佈財政經濟緊急處分命令之後，全國銀錢業及各種交易市塲，均停業二天，昨天又値星期例假，將於今天隨新幣金圓券開始發行而復業。在十一月二十日以前，法幣雖與金圓券可同時通用，但一切物價從今天起均將以金圓券標價，而能否完全以十九日以前的價格折合金圓券，當爲這次改革幣制成敗的一大關鍵。蔣總統爲此昨日特在首都發表重要談話，一方面希望全國人民與政府互信合作，人民與人民之間也互相勸吿，協助政府推行法令，完成這次改革幣制的重要任務，另一方面則警吿國人，如仍有投機操縱擾亂金融情事，决依照總動員法令及刑事法規，嚴厲制裁。全國人民聽了這一席話，無不深爲感動。今天上海市塲一般的物價能否完全以十九日以前的價格折合金圓券而不發生任何波動，宜可認爲上海市民有無擁護國策决心的試金石。</p>
<p>中央一向重視上海爲全國經濟的樞紐。上海物價的漲落，足以左右全國各地的物價：所以政府這次改革幣制，也特別重視上海物價會不會波動。蔣總統曾一再表示，盼望上海金融工商界能領導協助政府完成任務，期望的殷切，使上海市民益威其所負責任的重大。按常例說，今天上海的物價决不致發生波動，使呱呱墮地的良好新幣一出世就遭受磨折，致爲親者所痛而爲仇者所快。</p>
<p>再平心而論，這次政府旣以絕大的决心改革幣制，從任何一個角度去觀察，都是値得人民竭誠擁護的，其重要性誠如蔣總統所說：「此次改革幣制，實爲整個國家民族榮枯禍福所繫」。退一步說，卽使不爲國家利益着想，就是僅爲個人利害打算，對於政府改革幣制，也應該全心全力，協助其完成。理由根簡單：第一，法幣死亡之前，確已到達惡性膨脹的開始階段，如果政府還沒有「壯士斷腕」的决心去改革，則不僅物價高漲漫無止境，使人民生活均威受其威脅，就是一切工商業也將因物價·工資·利息的循環高漲而陷於枯竭崩潰之境。經過這次改革之後，不但有利於財政金融的穩定，而且人民生活工商百業，從此也可望其安定了。第二，法幣因爲發行制度的不健全，早已失去了人民的信用，致使法幣對貨物的購買價値，遠在其實際價値之下。現在改發新幣，不僅有十足的準備，而且採取公開發行制，保證準備也歸監理會接收保管，自可望其恢復人民對於新幣的信心。第三，過去法幣的幣値變動不定，實爲工商業的致命傷，任何生產計劃，任何營業計劃，都無從談起，現在發行新幣，幣値穩定，從此自可促進生產，繁榮市面，增加出口，使我國對外貿易和國際收支也可望漸趨平衡。</p>
<p>幣制改革的利害得失，可謂一望而知，全國人民除了少數喪心病狂的自私自利者而外，沒有不擁護新幣希望其成功的。但是我們爲了眞誠希望成功起見，仍不得不率直指出，政府於此，有須萬分努力克制者二事：第一，政府必須尊重發行權的獨立，使中央銀行金圓券的發行，完全受監理委員會的事前監督，使沒有一元一角一分的金圓券無準備而貿然發行。要這樣做，先請監理委員會檢査以往法幣及東北流通券的發行總額，公開報吿，並絕對停止今後的續印。再將用以收兌此項舊幣的金圓劵劃出於總額之中，以爲陸續收兌之用，庶幾不致因二者同時通用而增加通　之總額。同時，非得監理委員會負責人之簽署，絕對不隨便發行一張金圓券，以昭大信於天下，第二，政府必須絕對保蹬善良人民服從法令者之財產所有權，而對違法營私之徒，則從嚴懲處臺不假借。過去政府法令頒布而後，到執行時每每走樣，率先奉行者反受其累，今後萬不可重蹈覆轍。老實說，社會上總有若干　機取巧從中漁利者，現在看到政府改革幣制，穩定經濟，安定民生，無異宣吿了他們的末日已到，他們或心猶未死，勢將乘機而起，不在黑市中興風作浪，就要在市塲裏拉抬物價，企圖擊敗政府所實施的財經緊急處分辦法。甚至奸匪間諜，到處存在，或竟抱了幸災樂禍的心理，唯恐國家幣制改革成功，從而百般鼓煽擾亂市塲以爲快。所以我們如切望幣制改革成功，則必須要人民與政府互信合作，向這些敗類挑戰，最後克服他們。</p>
<p>要之，蔣總統已經率直表示，政府對於這次幣制改革，不僅有「必成」的信念，而且還抱絕大的决心，只要政府執行人員認眞從事，切實執行，只要全國人民能與政府互信合作，一心一德去苦撑苦幹，則今後所將面臨的任何困難問題，均不難迎刃而解。但，萬事必須愼於始謀，看今天上海的物價，不但可以看出改　幣制前途的成敗，而且上海市民有沒有天良理性，有沒有服從守法的精神，有沒有半斷得害得失的能力，一齊都可以看出來了。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕倫敦廿二日廣播莫斯科訊：美大使史密斯·英特使羅伯茲·及法大使夏台岳，廿二日在史密斯寓邸會商一小時又三刻，爲歷次會談時間最長之一次。三國使節刻正等待訪晤莫洛托夫之消息，渠等相信莫洛托夫或將於星期日（廿二日）接見三國使節。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社巴黎廿一日電〕今日據接近法外交部方面透露：駐莫斯科三强代表將晋謁史達林作三强與蘇聯初步談話中之最後一次會談。又稱，昨夜所接法大使夏合岳之報吿，現正由外交部予以研究。莫斯科談話旨在對開始四强對德問題談判之條件獲致同意，故談次僅商討因蘇聯封鎖及實行幣制改革所促成之柏林局勢，他如賠償與魯爾等事件全未涉及。法人方面最後切實否認外傳西方三强因意見不一致，故遲遲未與蘇外長莫洛托夫約定舉行下次談話日期之說。</p>

<h3>柏林三佔區邊界　英美蘇憲兵對峙</h3>
<p>〔中央社柏林廿一日合衆電〕英美已加强警衛力量，在波茨坦默廣塲上，刻有憲兵一百五十人與一百六十五名蘇方軍警相對峙，空氣漸見緊張。湧往波茨坦默廣塲觀望之德國民衆，共四千人，英憲兵六十人封鎖波茨坦路口，美憲兵七十五人於吉普巡邏隊支持下，在附近斯揣斯曼街上佈崗。彼等以吉普軍爲陣綫，刺刀均已上槍。</p>
<p>〔合衆社柏林廿二日電〕英美憲兵巡邏隊廿二日續駐柏林鬧市戒備，而兩日來為暴動，槍擊，刀刺及綁架中心之波茨坦默廣塲反轉趨靜謐。英美蘇三佔區犬牙交錯之邊界上，新設之招貼木柵及電網，使各佔區之分野一目了然。美國公安組長艾洗華稱，憲兵巡邏隊將晝夜留守該地，「以保衛吾人之部份」。黑市商廿二日晨又來波茨坦默廣塲各就原位，然交易時三心兩意，亦乏大批顧主。按昔日麕集者有四千人，現僅有五百德人往來觀望。美公安組及軍紀科均未接關於前二日被蘇軍綁去德警察八人之消息。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社莫斯科廿二日電〕塔斯社今晨發表最近柏林波茨坦默廣塲事件之消息稱，蘇聯警察曾受到一羣混入羣衆中之暴徒襲擊。該社對於英美警察之態度頗爲不滿，謂英美警察在出事之時袖手旁觀，對於暴動者並不上前阻止，直待蘇聯憲兵開來後秩序始行恢復。塔斯社之結論稱，此次暴動純屬有計劃者，此項計劃可由美英攝影記者早在出事地點攝影一事設明之。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕倫敦廿二日廣播：據德國方面消息：西方行政當局正與來自蘇區之右翼領袖會商蘇區內之非共產黨員參加計劃中之西德政府一事。據非正式報告，蘇區領袖之一爲前蘇區右翼基督民主黨主席。前蘇區内政界人物是否在西德政府中享有投票權，尙屬疑問。但一般德人相信，無論莫斯科四强談判之結果如何，東區德人應有參加西德政府之權。</p>

<p>此項問題，當國務部於二十日答覆蘇聯，關於蘇聯對三逃亡蘇籍敎師案之冗長抗議，顯係根據「洛茂金之不確報吿」時，已公開提出詢問。洛茂金之被令離境，即因其絕大之錯誤行動。同時，國務部官員預測，莫斯科必將提出關於三敎師案之新抗議，一般以爲：蘇聯對要求召回洛茂金之堅强行動，決不願不置答辯。若干權咸人仕並認爲：蘇聯必將揑造事實，攻擊美國駐蘇官員，以爲洛茂金被逐之報復，蓋在兩國恢復外交關係後之十五年中，此種情形尙屬首次、一般官員認爲目前緊張之國際局勢，尙不致引起戰爭，除非蘇聯對美國政府對蘇政策之估計，犯下嚴重錯誤</p>

<h3>美國大選前奏曲之四　大砲英雄華萊士</h3>
<p>— 本報駐美特派員毛樹清</p>
<p>〔本報紐約八月十三日航訊」在一九四八年的美國競選舞台上，亨利·華萊士可算得是天字第一號的大「英雄」了！上個月，費城舉行華萊士的第「黨成立大會，他們的標語是：「戰爭乎？華萊士乎？」華萊士不但象徵着未來的「和平之神」，而且也象徵着從第二次世界大戰結束以來，世界有種種紛亂，完全是因爲缺少了華萊士的緣故。在費城大會席上，華萊士挺起胸膛講過：「如果羅斯福先生逝世以後，我當美國的大總統，今天便沒有所謂柏林危機！」</p>
<p>爲什麽呢？因爲蘇聯相信華萊士，第三黨開幕典禮上，黑人律師霍華奪曾經說過：「蘇聯一向在尋找世界和平，就因爲美國缺乏當政的大政治家，所以美蘇關係，弄得這步田地！」華萊士自己，對於史達林給他的私人函件，非常珍視，他說：如果他能够當選爲美國大總統，他一定可以開誠和史達林商量世界和平，所以，「凡是不願意再有戰爭的人，都來選舉我！」</p>
<p>第三黨大會的宣言中說：西方列强與蘇聯的戰爭，無疑爲法西斯與死神之勝利，「惟和平爲人類唯一之生路。」又說：「蘇美兩國之携手，當大有助於世界和平」。怎樣携手呢？宣方中提到「取消馬歇爾援歐計劃，停止援助希臘和土耳其的貪汚政府」，在美國國内，「立即取消平時微兵法案」，因爲徵兵法案有「備戰」的嫌疑，備戰就是對蘇聯的敵視。</p>
<p>當華萊士他們正在開會的時候，正是「柏林危機」最緊張的時候，許多人問華萊士，怎樣應付柏林危機？華萊士說得很乾脆：「美國從柏林撤退」。爲了不得罪於蘇聯，爲了尋求「世界和平」，華萊士認爲美國軍隊沒有留駐柏林的必要。</p>
<p>全美國的報紙，都刋載了華萊士的驚人的主張，紐約前鋒論壇報的記者成司脫，從費城發回電報來說：「那眞是可怕的一羣，一羣可怕的共產黨陰謀者，操從着會塲，再加上一羣不知天高地厚的愚蠢的靑年，憑一點簡單的理想，在那裏搖旗吶喊。」他說：「華萊士本人並非共產黨，但他的所說所爲，已經沒有了理志，完全爲共產黨所操縱。」紐約每日新聞的記者奧唐納寫道：「華萊士的大會，是一個可怕的魅、影，克林姆宮指揮下的一套陰謀詭計，在愚弄着美國的病態敎育下的靑年!」</p>
<p>華萊士自己堅決否認他被共產黨操縱，在費城斯屈福特飯店的記者招待會上，一大羣美國記者，逼着問他跟共產黨之間的關係，華萊士最初不願講，記者們接二連三逼着要回答，使這位一九四八年的競選英雄，由困窘到憤怒，他認爲美國資本家所　　的斬聞記者，在故意跟他搗蛋。若干聰明記者從旁解釋：「我們並不是有意爲難，我們不過是要知道一個是北答案，做新問報導而已！」經此一解釋，華萊七覺得心平氣和了一點，他說：「若銳共產黨操縱我們的成立大會，完全是無稽誹謗，在今天，許多右派的人說我華萊士共產，眞正的共產黨，又說我是進步的資本主義者。共產黨他們所以擁護我，完全是因爲我主張與蘇聯携手的緣故！」</p>
<p>華來士的「競選伴侶」，第三黨的副總統候選人泰勒，說得更幽默，他說共產黨是主張武力革命，推翻現政府的，「凡是這次同情我們第三黨的，都比較是不太深紅的，比較是淺紅色的共產黨徒。要知道眞正深紅色的正牌共產黨員，他們寗願擁護共和黨，寗願選舉杜威。」爲什麽呢？因爲眞正的共產黨員，「希望再有一個胡佛，再有一次經濟大恐慌。」</p>
<p>解釋雖然很幽默，但是會內會外，對第三黨和共產黨之間的猜疑，仍然層出不窮。當大會宣言在會内一讀二讀的時候，有一位代表詹姆斯羅依勃，一個美國民主運動會的會員，憤憤的設：「宣言草案是共產黨在從中操從的，我們不能那樣肯定的贊成蘇聯的一切，我們不能說凡是蘇聯所做的，一切都是好的！」另一位代表麥克托尼，美國勞工運動的健將，國會議員，他主張宣言不應該太親蘇，不應該太傾向共產黨。話剛說完，引起若干激烈份子的憤怒，芝加哥來的塔格咸博士，宣言起草委員會的主席，首先反對修正。他說：蘇聯是愛好和平的，第三黨不能缺少蘇聯的友誼。霍華特大學醫學院院長瓊斯敦，紐約第三黨競選總部的負責人普萊斯曼，後來牽連到國際間諜案的傢伙，都起來痛斥所謂「修正案」。塔格威還鄭重提醒大會代表：「要珍惜團結一致的代價，要認淸意見紛歧的危險。」</p>
<p>塔格威滿口全是羅斯福，他說他了解羅斯福總統，比任何人都深刻。他說：「如果羅斯福今天尙在人世，他一定會同情第三黨的政綱和政策的。』他還說到：羅斯福生前某一天和他談天，羅說將來民主黨必然要分裂，民主黨因爲歷中因素，決不能貫澈他的許多生張，羅斯福總統並且預料將來會有一個「進步黨」出現。</p>
<p>第三黨正式定名爲「進步黨」，也許是根據這個理由來的。本來，自從華萊士在去年十二月宣佈組黨競選以來，一般美國人腦筋中，都知道華萊士有一個政黨，但不知道到底是什麽黨？華萊士自己說：「我要競選，做進步的美國公民的總統」，外面都稱他爲「新黨」或「第三黨」，到這次費城成立大會，才正式定名爲「進步黨」。</p>
<p>其實，進步黨這個名字，並不是塔格咸博士新創的，在美國歷史上，這回算是第三次有進步黨了。遠在一九一二年，老羅斯福和約翰遜組織進步黨，競選總統，結果得了全國選票的百分之二十七，沒有成功。一九二四年，拉福萊和術勒，也組織過進步黨，得了選票的百分之十六，也沒有成功。進步黨的組織，都是曇花一現，不久即吿消滅。紐約時報說：進步黨大　容易取得大都市居民的擁護，但和全國人民隔得太遠。時報還說：從前的進步然，情形比較單純，現在有了共產黨夾在中間，當然比較複雜。究竟今年的進步黨，將來會有怎樣結局？那就要看這位大礮「英雄」華萊士的做法如何了。</p>
<h3>不解散國會兩黨將分裂　日閣勢必總辭職　社會黨主席片山警告廬田首相</h3>
<p>〔中央社東京廿一百電〕日本社會民主黨主席片山哲，昨日警吿蘆田首相稱：如現政府圖阻止解散議會，以求繼續保持政權，則內閣之總辭職，終屬不可避免，此爲前首相片山哲第二次公開表示社民黨主張解散現議會之決心。按蘆田首相最近曾發表聲明云。渠並未發現應將現議會解散之任何理由，政府將運用一切權力，避免此事。片山哲之警吿，即係爲辯駁蘆田首相之聲明而發。</p>
<p>隸社會民主黨左派之蘆田內閣勞相加藤勘十，支持片山哲，昨日曾吿日本報界稱：渠及其他社民黨左翼份子，均贊同及早解散議會之議。刻於北海道作旅行演說之片山哲氏，昨晨曾吿日本記者評論蘆田最近之聲明稱：蘆田岡避免解散議會所作之努力，必屬無效，徒能使民生黨與社會民主黨間之裂痕，愈益加深而已。片山哲指稱：兩黨間意見之岐異，因最繼之修正工資標準，與公務員法等，久經爭辯之問題，已更趨顯然，解散現議會，乃避免兩黨拆夥之唯一辦法，否則兩黨互相衝突之政策，終將促成現内閣總辭。</p>
<p>〔新亞社東京廿二日電〕蘆田首相廿一日曾於高岡市談稱：「國會之解散在今年年底以前，將儘量予以避免，其理由之一應將麥帥文件之內容，全面具體化，次爲完成外資接受之態勢。中央聯盟之工作，個人相信必可成功，而結果民主黨將成爲第一黨，惟正爲此，民主黨本身必須斷然加以改革，但絕對非惹起波斕之改革」。</p>

<h3>證交續暫停營業　昨議決交割辦法　王志莘將再普京請示復業問題</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕本市證券交易所，昨日下午五時，舉行第四十二次常務理事會，理事長杜鏞主席。首由總經理王志莘報吿晋京經過，繼即討論各案：（一）決議在未奉准行政院命令前，自八月廿三日起，繼續暫停營業。（二）已做成交易之交割日期及辦法，決議如次：</p>

<h3>劉維熾談僑匯</h3>
<p>認為政府應多獎勵</p>
<p>僑務委員會委員長劉維熾氏，頃就記者所提幣制改革對僑匯之影響如何一項問題，發表談話。渠認爲新幣幣値穩定，今後僑匯無需逃避，僑匯收入當可增加。唯前途能否永久樂觀，則繫於大局之能否安定。劉氏稱：僑匯依其性質，可分下列兩類：（一）贍家費用，今後僑匯旣母需經由黑市，此類匯款當可重歸政府掌握。（二）投資，此類數額在戰前所佔比率甚大，因國內利息向較國外爲商，今後政府如能長久維持幣信，大局亦漸趨穩定，回國投資之僑匯，必可激增。劉氏指出戰前僑匯年達三億元，約佔當時財政預算之百分之四十，目前各國除美國外，雖均限制華僑匯款，但今後僑匯收入，仍有希望達到每年一億美元。劉氏最後稱：情勢縱對僑匯有利，政府仍應多方獎勵，就余個人意見，輸管會前所公佈之僑資輸入辦法，其限制尙有再予放寬之必要。</p>
<h3>嚴限八一九物價　經警監視各業市場</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕警局經警大隊奉命今日起嚴密監視各業市塲，如發現經紀人有超越八月十九日市價成交時，槪予逮捕從嚴法辦。又金鈔黑市買賣仍嚴厲禁止，一經査獲，送特刑庭從嚴懲辦。</p>

<h3>四聯分處昨議決　國內匯款手續費</h3>
<p>自財政經濟緊急處分令頒佈後，上海四聯分處及國家行局工作極爲緊張，廿·廿一·廿二·三日，內部仍照常辦公，積極準備週一開關後新措施。四聯分處爲使上海國家行局庫業務配合政令起見，並於廿二日下午舉行臨時會議，對此後存放匯業務如何配合政令，均予詳細檢討。至國内匯款並經決定平匯手續費，本省每千圓五角，外省每十圓一圓，最少者每筆匯款收手續費一角，偏遠地區，無中央銀行代爲調撥頭寸者，得酌增手織變，即日起實施，郵費不收，電費照四賺總盧搞定辦理云。</p>
<h3>汽油恢履舊價　不敖成本甚鉅</h3>
<p>汽柴油等價格，各油公司已恪還政府法令，恢復十九日價格。茲悉所謂十九日價格，實係八月五日經輸管會核定，當時係按每美元合法幣六百三十三萬元，及上半月工人生活指數一百八十六萬倍計算，迨八月十五日美金元已漲至法幣八百卅六萬元，而下半月工人生活指數亦漲至三百六十三萬倍，各油公司乃聲請調整價格，而輸管會亦經於十九日核准。現旣因遵守新法令，恢復舊價，但新幣制每美元合四金圓，每金圓合法幣三百萬元，按此折合，每美元實等於法幣一千二百萬元。較八月五日定價前所採用之六百三十三萬元，不啻加倍。似此情形，各油公司售價，自屆不成本甚鉅，則來源變屬堪　。　油料之耗費外匯爲額過鉅，用戶於使用油料，亦須力求節約，以减輕我國之困難。</p>
<h3>孔聖學會倡導　孔誕助學運動</h3>
<p>孔聖學會定本月廿七日孔子聖誕節（即敎師節），參與西門文廟之祀孔禮，上午十時假大光明戯院獻映文藝影片公司影片「孔夫子」，招待全市各界首長，名流·新聞·文化各界·及各校敎師。該會王曉纖·吳蘊初·沈思敏·馮　初諸氏，正　備一切尊聖工作，其中最主要者爲倡導「萬元助學運動」，是日整天將假上海電台（九〇〇KC），特請各校歌詠隊（上午），影星·歌</p>
<h3>岡村寗次今日公審　京滬首長將來旁聽</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕頭號日本戰犯岡村寗次將於今晨九時半起在塘沽路市參議會全日舉行公審。軍事法庭已於昨日下午將市參議會三樓禮堂佈置成臨事法庭，並裝設擴音機等設備。該禮堂約可貨納五六百人旁聽，至昨日止，軍事法庭已發出旁聽證五百張左右，此外並柬邀首都及本市各機關首長曁各國外交使節觀審。據悉，國防部軍法局局長徐業道，本市市參議會議長潘公展及美國新聞處人士等均將出席，中央電影攝製廠並將在公審進行時拍攝電影以留紀錄。預料今日法庭上必有一番空前未有之盛况。</p>
<h3>銀行公會議決　減低存放款利率　增資未有結論　決請國行扶助</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕本市銀行公會，昨日上午十時召開臨時理監事會議，討論同業存放款利率及增資問題。錢業信託兩業公會，均派員列席。會議由理事長李銘親自主持。利率方面，決自本月廿日起，同業存款日拆，自原定法幣每千元二元四角，减爲金圓券一元（合月息三分）。同業放款日拆，自原定法幣每千元十五元，减爲金圓券五元，（合月息一角五分）。同業日折及公庫證拆放，自原定法幣每千元十三元，减爲金圓券三元，（合月息九分）。</p>
<p>增資問題，曾有詳細之討論，惟因問題複雜，未有結論。會中認爲：目前金融業務各項開支，一時不能降低，而幣制折合之後，存款資力不免减薄，增資更感困難，營業前途難有確切把握。此次忍痛犧牲，壓低利率，减去三分之二，業務上頗受打擊。以後有賴國行迅速推行重貼現及轉抵押政策，對金融業加以扶植。最後決議：由銀錢信託三業公會，聯名呈請國行兪總裁，陳述以上意見，希望對同業以後正當營運資金如何供應市塲，以及存放款利率如何酌中兩點，予以指示並多加輔導。</p>
<p>〔又訊〕全國銀行公會聯合會及本市銀行公會理事長李銘，全國錢業公會聯合會理事長秦潤卿，本市錢業公會理事長洗日新，本市信託業公會代理事長嚴成德，昨特聯名電呈總統，對財政經濟緊急處分令，一致表示擁護。</p>

<p>同心協力舉臻健全</p>
<p>谷部長致訓詞，略謂：上海市工業會組織完成，今天正式成立，足以表示將來中國工業前途之大有發展。上海市爲全國工業重心，此間工業會成立以後，可以爲全國工業會之領導者。本人現有三點意見：（一）爲使工業發展，應克服所有外在及内在困難，克服外在困難，應先使工業界本身技術及管理諸問題，盡力予以改善，大家同心合力，深信即是力量，使工業會之組織益臻健全。（二）工商合作，勞資協調，在今日國家社會勞工政策之下，要盡力促使勞資協調，並盡力與工商界密切合作，工業界本身發展亦即促進商業界之發展。（三）在政府實施新經濟措置後，非但維護國家，並維護整個工業，故希工業界發生配合作用，發生領導作用</p>
<p>協助政府渡過難關</p>
<p>吳市長略謂：今天上海市工業會成立，直接關係上海的建設和繁榮，間接也影響全國的建設和繁榮。我國最大的力量在上海，上海最大的力量在工業，工業界能使幣制改革方案成功，幫助政府，也幫助自已解決種種問題，我們就是成功。今天貴會成立，全市人民以至全國人民，都在衷心祈禱成功，希望拿出力量協助政府，渡過當前的難關，使經濟改革順利完成。</p>
<p>吳局長略謂，勝利後，工業界艱困情形，本人站在主管機關的立塲，非常了解，工業界過去因爲無統一機構，不能全盤謀劃解決困難，大多各自爲戰，無一領導機構，全盤解決，工業會成立後，今後對工業的前途定有極大幫助。工業會成立適在幣制改革後，新幣制穩定，對工業界有極大的幫助，希望能羣策羣力，配合政府政策使其實現。最後更希望工業會與總工會多取聯絡，勞資協調，實行國民黨勞資政策。</p>
<p>要和政府患難相共</p>
<p>潘議長致詞：貴會今天成立，工業界有了光明的希望，理由是政府正頒布改革幣制和經濟革新的命令，工業界以往受高物價高工資和高利貸的壓迫，透不過氣來，現在有了這四項改革辦法，只要社會人民擁護，眞心誠意幫助政府實行，這辦法是一定可以成功的，貴會今天成立，是第一個擁護這辦法的團體和力量。我們相信，工業界所屬的九千多個工廠，是一定擁護這辦法，政府要信任人民，要信任善良的人民，而從事工業生產的人，都是善良的。只有把資金逃避到國外，烟囱裏不冒烟的人才是不善良的，我們善良的工業生產，要和政府患難相共，一定能渡過難關，爭取工業界的光明前途。</p>
<p>嗣市商會理事長徐寄廎，總工會理事長水祥雲相繼致詞，表示願與工業會共同合作，發揚光大，以安定工人生活，而促進勞資協調。末由主席團束雲意致謝詞。</p>

<h3>報告檢舉鄧仲和真相　朱政文招待各界　分析四點靜候司法解決</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕鄧仲和被控漢奸案，正由高檢處進行偵查中。原檢舉人朱政文除以鄧指稱其爲「恐嚇匪」，另向地院提起自訴，控以誹謗罪責外，昨午並假仙樂斯舞宮招待各界，報吿檢舉事項。朱爲表明其身份，及戰時從事地下工作情形，特將前國民政府所授獎狀及勝利勛章，置於座前，引人注目，據朱報告稱：（一）渠此次檢舉鄧仲和漢奸，係根據事實及已搜得一切證件，決非憑空無稽而別有作用，今鄧忽誣稱渠爲恐嚇匪，誠屬不解，旣是匪何不向當局控吿，而待自身被檢舉後，始公然誣稱爲匪，顯係銜恨誣陷，實應負刑事責任。（二）戰時渠與强雷留滬祖任鋤奸工作，致函警吿鄧仲和停止資敵行爲，鄧願出少數金錢資助抗敵部隊，在抗敵立塲，實爲愛國行爲，在敵僞立塲，自可隨意加人以侮辱名詞，鄧所謂第一次敲詐，即指此而言。（三）渠控鄧漢奸之理由，除爲過去萬里浪一信外，尙有其他有力證據，不便宣佈，鄧以軍毯棉花紗布及其他重要物資資敵，並更聯絡敵軍部將鄧自設之安樂一廠廠址，供給豐田紡織株式會社爲職員宿舍，復以鄧與敵軍部之特殊關係，鄧所設之廠不受供電限制。（四）渠與樂潤庭去冬有向英人葛蘭生要求理淸債務之事，時萬屋被鄧乘隙占有，乃與鄧互控於警局，有記錄可査，如有敲詐行爲，警局豈不置理，是鄧稱渠第二次敲詐，爲故意誣陷中傷，藉圖洩忿。渠末稱：現在一切旣訴諸於法，自當靜候司法解決。</p>

<h3>豫北水災區　煙波浩淼　四萬民熬苦百災·受痛</h3>
<p>— 本報特派記者　凌松壽</p>
<p>〔本報修武十八日航訊〕十年來，豫北人民窒息在火藥的空氣中，却還要再受天災的侵襲。遠的不說，近如卅一·卅二年的大旱災，和其後的蝗災，去年的水災，今年三月間的一陣風災，把原武，陽武，延津三縣的麥田幾十萬畝，毁壞個乾凈，風災的賬還沒結算淸楚，七月裏又來了沁泛，懷成空前的水災。</p>
<p>此次水災，據新鄕第四區專員公署公布，計：災區廣達一一五一五四六畝，遍及新鄉，修武，獲嘉武陡，輝，汲，洪，濬，滑等九縣之境，冲毁房屋四二四一九間，死傷四八九口，有四〇〇二六〇人的災民急待賬濟。</p>
<p>七月三十一日，修武，武陟兩縣的代表，涉水到新鄕向各界呼籲，武陟縣代表對記者說，武陡縣除去沁泛而外還加上因黄河倒灌而成的水災，被黄水淹沒的田畝達二十萬畝，死於水中的有三千餘人，待救災民達六萬餘人。</p>
<p>洪水北流</p>
<p>這次水災的成因，要追溯到去年的水災，去年七月，共匪陳賡部約五六萬人要窺伺焦作，於是一股勁兒連陷沁陽，博愛，條武，孟縣等四縣。八月間我新鄉焦作駐軍東西夾擊，收復修武，打通新焦間的交通。共匪沒有就此甘心，在武陡縣境內大樊村附近，決沁水堤，效法當年黄河的決口，來截斷焦作與外間的聯繫。</p>
<p>沁水從山西流入豫境，經沁陽，濟源縣境，繞過武陟縣城流注黄河，河堤旣決於是滔滔洪水北流流入丹河，泛成一大片災區。去年沁泛雖已成災，但是因爲當時豫北雨量不大，而且秋禾大部份都已經收割，所以災情還輕。從去年到今年，一年之間也有人想過堵口辦法，可是決口處在匪的控制下，如談堵口，不講工程大小，而堵塞之後，至少有兩個團的兵力駐守，否則誰也不敢保險共匪不扒第二次的。</p>
<p>今年七月十八，十九，廿日，豫北霪雨連日，沁水的水位驟增，太行山上的山洪直瀉，丹河係衛河的上流，原僅是很狹小的一道河，它如何能容納得下這許多客來之水，於是分向南北岸潰泛，沒田畝，傷人畜，捲走了房屋，傢俱，一發而不可收拾了。</p>
<p>黄泛方面，據四區張敬忠專員對記者談；抗戰時他在豫北打游擎的時候，那時共匪還是友軍，却決開了沁水北堤，想淹死駐在武陟西境的他所指揮的部隊，張氏爲求宣洩南流之水，便在黄河堤畔挖了三個缺口，現在黄水倒灌的進口萬陵村，便是當時三個缺口之一。</p>
<p>記者抵新鄉，新焦轉運段閻夢鯉段長便指着車站上的月台，告訴我水位最高時，幾與月台相平</p>
<p>目前水勢已經稍退，而新鄕災情尙不是頂嚴重的地方，所以在新鄕市區還看不出什麽水災的迹象。記者曾行於北關郊外，丹河的水流洶湧，據當地人說這是平常極少的現象。</p>
<p>由於交通和地理的因素，豫北這次水災，也許不太被人們重視。記者決心去訪問災區，事前考慮到交通和治安問題，記者決定了以災情最重的修武爲對象。</p>
<p>枕木造筏</p>
<p>三日，我偕修武來新呼籲的縣然部范承芳書記長赴修，新鄉到修武的距離是一百華里，我們藉着新焦段的搶修工程車，可以跑到第三十一公里的地方——獅子營，其餘的三十八華里，就要步行了。</p>
<p>走出新鄉站，越過平漢路，鐵路兩旁都還有些積水未退，過去一直是黄土平原，今日却處處是池塘淸水。經過獲嘉縣，縣城在水的包圍中，繼續西行三四華里，鐵路便成爲一個狹而長的半島，在兩旁的大水中伸展出去。</p>
<p>抵獅子營，再向西的路程便開始步行，沿着鐵路路基沒走到兩華里，前面就是一個缺口，這是附近居民爲了宣洩北流的水而挖的。這個缺口不大，於是我脫下長褲，脫下襪子，換上勤務兵的布底鞋，涉水過去，水漫到我的腿灣。</p>
<p>路基上零零落落地放着一些鐵軌，路面上的石子上，還可以看到水浸過的潰痕，路基高過田畝有五六尺，我們可以想見水位高時的水深。</p>
<p>在路基上有無數的缺口，水像是無止盡地自南向北流着，小些的缺口，我們涉水過去，大些的缺口，有些上面用兩根鐵軌架着橋，我們顫巍巍地以「如臨深淵」的心境走過去，身子側過來横行，不敢往下看，有些缺口間水勢太大了，投機的災民，用木頭編成一個一丈見方的木筏，四個大抬住四角，人站在上面，他們在水中走着，水可以漫到他們的嘴邊，有一個木筏用十根鐵路上的枕木編起來，上面放着一塊黑板，會發感慨的人一定會說：「這是天災人禍交迫下的敎育和建設！」</p>
<p>官不點燈</p>
<p>在經常不容易看到水的這裏，現在是烟波浩淼，一望無際，房屋有一半被浸在水中，高粱桿兒雖高，可是經水一浸，它不會結實了，路旁有一個農人在水中診察他的莊稼，我隔着水問他：「中不中，老鄕？」「不中了！」聽他的聲昔，我可以體察到他的心情。向北望去，水似乎一直漫到太行山脚，太行山吐着一朶朶的白雲，它在旁邊嘆氣。</p>
<p>路旁每逢一個小村落，便有一些攤販，在賣茶，賣西瓜。許多小孩子（可以算災小孩子）光着身體，搶着我們吃下來的西瓜皮，爲了一塊瓜皮，他們可以打一塲架。沿路上說不盡的觸目驚心的慘狀，陪着西下的夕陽，送我們跑到修武。</p>
<p>第二天，狂風暴雨，我無法工作。晚上，我和范書記長在縣政府和剛從待王鎭督戰歸來的徐文濤縣長聊夫，縣政府沒錢點燈，屋中漆黑，窗外是風雨凄其，院的古槐被大風刮得沙沙作響。</p>
<p>徐縣長吿訴了記者一篇征糧賬目；軍糧方面，本年七月到九月共征五千大包，計一百萬斤。省公糧方面，今年一年計征六千五百石，合計九十七萬三千斤。專署公糧方面，今年六月至明年元月要五千石，計七十五萬斤，縣政府本身的支出和地方團隊的糧餉，計每月需要三千石，合四十五萬斤。可是修武縣能出多少糧呢？全縣能耕的田畝只有一千頃，每畝以產糧三斗計，全年產糧不過三萬石，只够修武縣本身的支出。修武農間有個歌謠：春三月，秋三月，菜三月，忍三月。那是說春收可以維持三個月的食糧秋收也可維持三個月，有三個月要到外面挖野菜吃，其餘三個月只有忍着挨餓了。在平時，修武的食糧是不能自給自足的。去年沁泛成災，今年的麥收不好，不是徐縣長帶着自衛團隊出去搶割田糧，修武縣的今年春荒就很難過得去。截至現在爲止，修武還欠上面三百多萬的軍糧公糧要繳，所以范書記長曾對我說：修武人不希望上面救濟水災，只希望能把這許多欠糧免繳就心滿意足了。記者住在修武的其後幾天，證實了縣政府窮的程度，縣長曾爲修獲博武四縣指揮部所要的一千萬元經費而焦急得皺眉，自衛隊的連長曾因士兵沒有飯吃而向縣長哭訴，這都是比水災還更嚴重的事實。</p>
<p>五日，記者和專署王視察，范書記長坐着小船，撑到修武西部災區，我們在十多丈闊的河面上走着。問問人，這原來是修武到博愛的一條公路。一篙子下去，水足有六七尺。我們的船撑過去，千萬綹柳絲，掠拂過我們的臉龐，可惜楊柳在這裏已成爲惹愁的東西，不然，眞個是「翠拂行人首」了。</p>
<p>船在公路上撑着，在田畝間撑着，撑到楊廠，這是一個較大的村子。</p>
<p>黑麵瓜皮</p>
<p>一進村，老百姓們知道我們是來勘災的，於是一齊跪在我們面前，淚如泉湧。一位老人們對我說：「去年水災，秋麥沒收到，今年的麥子又不中，只想秋能到手，好過日子，現在秋可又淹了，敎我們咱過？」說着一粒粒的淚珠流下來了！</p>
<p>我問一位老婆婆：一你們吃啥？」她吿訴我淌水到外村去要些黑麵，回來煮湯喝，她又噙着眼淚說：「我的大孫子在外面吃瓜皮，却吃病了，現在還睡在家中。」她的話還沒完，旁邊的一位中年婦人又搶着說：「俺的小妞兒（女孩子）前幾天到外面挑野菜，被水淹死了。」沒等到說完，她已嗚嗚地哭了起來。</p>
<p>在一片嗚咽聲中，有幾個災民對我們說：「我們已沒得吃的，還有部隊向我們要糧，不給就打。我們只希望能把沁河口堵住，水退了，我們好種地，不管啥糧，我們都給，現在啥都沒了，敎我怎拿得出呢？」經過我們安慰了一陣，答應替他們交涉，他們這才讓我們在村中跑了一圈。</p>
<p>村中有幾座瓦屋，院中都還有一尺來深的水，牆壁上六七尺高的地方，還留着水痕。泥土房子，大半是塌了，主婦們在整理着零亂的傢具，有幾匹驢子或牛，都瘦得可憐，它們也痴瞪着眼向着我們。</p>
<p>離開楊廠時，災民還一再可叮　着我們：「委員們要多向中央說啊！」聲昔和被風吹着的水中的高梁桿兒，一同發着戰慄的調子</p>
<p>返城後，修武的各界首長，正計議着明年春荒如何渡過。因爲沁河口不堵塞，看樣子水不會退的，誤了種靑期，明年春天就沒吃的。而堵口問題，新鄕某機關還抱着否定的態度，他們認爲堵口水退，將影響到豫北的防務。可是被困在水中的豫北四百萬災民將如何地活下去呢？</p>

<h3>瀋陽社會相</h3>
<p>— 本報記者　趙展</p>
<p>〔本報瀋陽十九日航訊〕瀋陽對外唯一的交通是空運，這稱近於窒息的經濟生活，增加了瀋陽的不安，改變瀋陽的面貌，社會問題一天比一天多，矛盾一天比一天多，罪犯也一天比一天多，只要看一看十幾處平民食堂前排列的長蛇陣，爲一餐鵠候數小時的貧民羣，在最繫華的太原街餓斃的乞丐，便可以體會到糧荒的情形。每天打開報紙，滿篇積累的罪犯新聞，也極易找到答案：飢餓造成的變態心理，在求生困難之際，或悲憤·仇恨·走險·或消極·沉淪·輕生·這些都是犯罪心理的根據。</p>
<p>盜風與姦案　紛至而沓來</p>
<p>最習見的是強盜案件，盜刦之流行是今日瀋陽的嚴重問題，日前轟動一時的十三億大刦案，主犯竟是現役憲兵，已予槍決了，刦盜的方式不一，有許多强盜冒充軍人行搶，小偸在夜間被格斃的很多，大大小小的盜案日見增加。治安當局已感覺沒有寬闊的監　容納這樣多的盜犯，囚糧一項負担，也感到十分困難。</p>
<p>漲風之下，姦風也狂襲瀋腸。這裏且　一個例子：一個十二歲的幼女竟遭卅二歲的淫棍强姦，該女名王玉如，有某部上尉盧幹與其姑母曾一度姘居，因不睦而離異。十日晚盧幹來尋其姑母求歡而遭拒絕，其姑母又因故外出，盧幹見女嬌嫩可愛，頓生獸慾，强行姦汚，致該女受傷昏厥。在這事之前，有一個于洪區第三保的保指導員，藉査戶口爲名，强姦一個十四歲少女，再之前有轟動瀋陽的强姦四中學生王家琳之王孚，該犯亦已處死。</p>
<p>早死少受罪　晒乾省棺材</p>
<p>自殺，在瀋陽，已不算有刺激性的新聞，雖無詳細統計，最近自殺的案件增加是事實，全家服毒者有之，跳渾河者有之，更有人到風景幽雅的北陵去吊死，在瀋陽只要你是睜着眼睛走路，便可看見暴屍街頭的慘象。大都是餓斃的，一具屍體被人家移來移去，誰也不願屍體在自己的門前腐臭，當局不巷他們收屍，也就無人過問，路人只是掩鼻而過。記者日前經過北市區瀛州飯店門前，有一個乞丐在餓斃了的乞丐身旁走過，感歎似的說：「早死少受罪，晒乾啦，省棺材」。</p>
<p>可憐太原街學生當遊妓</p>
<p>到過瀋陽的人，都知道柔情的春日町，（現改稱太原街）光復之初，是日本女人出賣破爛，賣弄風情的地方，現在情景依稀，不過換了一幅面孔而已。我們眼見我們的同胞姊妹做了日本女人的替身，而日本女人却早已回到日漸繁熒的日本。釩餓驅使一大羣失業婦女出賣肉體的生涯，每當華燈初上之時，便似幽靈一般的出現街頭，估計「這種「職業」婦女總數在萬人以上。她們足跡最活躍的地方是太原街，因爲太原街是酒吧間，咖啡店集中的地方，類似東京的「銀座」。瀋陽的夜景就在這條短短的馬路上。若干旅館，均爲人肉黑市，其價格則沒有猪肉市塲高昻。據說遊妓之中，竟有女學生　身其間。這些苦命的神女看得很明白，她們的靈魂不向上帝超升，便隨肉體以俱腐。</p>
<h3>醫學教官馬立師　在無錫服毒身死</h3>
<p>〔本報無錫廿一日訊〕通運路中國飯店二〇六號房間旅客馬立師，於今晨十時許，突然服毒自殺，其死因頗覺離奇。緣該旅客係現任國防部聯勤　部第十一醫學院少校敎官，年卅一歲，於本月十九日到店後，曾徵召妓女一名，到店閒談，今晨茶役進房時始發覺馬已服毒，雖立刻報吿賬房，延醫救治，然已不及，現屍體已舁送旅棧公會，下午並報請地檢處派員相騐，委係服毒身死，惟並未騐出所服何毒，自殺原因未詳。</p>

<h3>關外行（七）　廿青油礦　福利事業調查</h3>
<p>— 本報記者　宋麟</p>
<p>〔本報蘭州十八日航訊〕石油工業的本身只有兩種工程，即是採油和煉油，因之只有兩個部門，即是井塲和煉廠。在甘肅玉門老君廟的甘靑油礦廠，井塲部份包括所屬的工程室「鑿井部，鑿井一·二兩隊，採油部，裝修部，一共只有五百多個員工·煉廠部份包括煉務部，機電部，工程管理室，油品庫，製蠟廠，文事課，化驗室，一共也只七百多個員工，所以直接從事生產的，只有一千二百多人，但甘靑油礦的負工總人數却是五千三百多人。這四千多人裏面，除了比例極少的管理人員外，大都是爲了配合石油生產工程的順利進行，而從事員工福利事業的人。</p>
<p>遺世獨立　福利第一</p>
<p>甘靑油礦的負責人，對於員工福利事業與工程事務同樣的重視，因爲在這祁連山麓一片無邊的戈壁灘上，雖然石油河水終年的不斷北流，可是它的兩岸却連一叢低矮的灌木都沒有，縱然你有黄金萬鎰，也決買不到一斤大餅，這是一個遺世獨立的地方，金礦九千個員工及其眷屬的日常生活供應品，無不仰賴外方。拿糧食說：須自三百公里以外地方去購運日食的菜蔬，也得取之一百公里以外的酒泉，而這些供應品是一天也短少不得的，所以福利事業的推行，遂成爲該礦必要而急切的措施。</p>
<p>甘靑油礦辦理福利事業已有十年的歷史，他們無日不在設法改善，但由於種種條件的限制，還不能達到理想的境地，不過，對於員工及其眷屬的必要衣食，目前已能供應無缺。</p>
<p>記者在礦參觀時，和該礦主辦福利事業的總務組吳組長松林，福利課王課長長庚談起這項艱巨繁難的工作，吳組畏說：「我們對員工福利的理想，不但要改善他們的生計，維護他們的利益，適應他們的要求，减輕他們的生活負担，而且還要想充實他們的精神生活，提高其工作興趣，並予以業餘進修及娛樂休閑的機會，以促進他們身心的健全。另外，謀致員工的安全保障，解除他們生活上的威脅與疾病災難的防護，救助等。「是的，這種工作太重要了！」王課長接着說：「辦得好不好，不但直接影饗近萬員工和眷屬的生活，就是對本礦事業的發展，也有極大的關係。」</p>
<p>這許多人日常供應品的來源，是靠福利課派駐張掖，武威，酒泉，玉門的辦事處就需要隨時購運，主要的是食糧，肉類及乾菜，鮮菜，鷄蛋，調味品等，至於衣料，襪子，牙膏，毛中……等日用品，則是該課駐蘭州辦事處或委託各地營業所及上海總公司代爲購運的。按目前的需要，每年要採購食糧四萬五千石，日用品一千噸，菜蔬兩千噸。這些東西，又大部是蘭州營業所的車輛代運。</p>
<p>抑低物價　實施配售</p>
<p>該礦員工有三分之二以上是西北人，西北人民的主食是麵粉，所以該礦在購到小麥後，在嘉峪關設有水磨六盤，在老君廟設有機器磨粉廠一個自行磨粉，每月共能磨得麵粉三十萬斤，已够全礦人的需要。目前每一員工每月配售大米五市升，麵粉廿一市斤至四十四市斤（小口酌减），其他菜油兩市斤，食鹽一市斤，醬油醋共約四市斤。這些東西的價格不但很便宜，而且儘量抑低配售給工人的價格。七月份的價格表（單位元）如下：</p>
<p>本年度配售員工及眷屬日用品數量表</p>
<p>在蘭州，目前每斗米要賣七百七十萬元，麵粉每市斤要賣三百三十萬元了，所以該礦的員工生活都很安定，大都盡忠職守，勇於任事，這和其他大都市的工廠常鬧勞資糾紛的情形比起來，眞是另外一個天地了。</p>
<p>其他衣料。鞋襪等十幾種日用福利品，採定量分配製，一律平價供應，至於香烟·糖菓及其他日用耗費品，則按酒泉的市價，隨意購買，不加限制</p>
<p>這些物品的七月份售價是呢料每市尺五十萬元，肥皂每條八萬元，牙刷每把十萬元，靑市布每市尺九萬元。</p>
<p>各項機構　應運而生</p>
<p>在記者參觀的日程裏，列有許多供應社所附屬的生產，衛生及其他機構，都是爲適應員工生活的需要而設立的，茲分記如次：</p>
<p>（A）生產機構：</p>
<p>（一）縫衣部：每月平均製中西服一千套，各種雜件兩千件（二）製鞋部：每月平均製皮鞋一百雙，布鞋五百雙。（三）醬作部：製作勢油，麪醬，辣醬，醬菜等，視需要量製作。（四）釀造部：製調味之醋，也看需要量釀造。（五）糕點部：焙製各種點心，平均每月製三百市斤。（六）豆腐部：製作豆腐及豆腐乾，以補充菜蔬不足，每月平均生產廿萬方：</p>
<p>（B）衛生設施：</p>
<p>（一）浴室：設淋浴廿四具，輪流入浴，並附設減蝨間，，以蒸氣滅蝨。（二）理髮部：三所，工匠廿名。（三）洗衣部：工人五十名，以極低代價代洗衣物。（四）中藥部：銷售中藥及成藥。</p>
<p>（D）其他設施：</p>
<p>（一）食堂：承辦經濟客飯簡單的宴席及零星小吃。（二）攝影部：拍攝及加洗照片。（三）修理部：修理破鞋及修焊各種器皿。</p>
<p>另一個萊　部裏，經常備有鮮菜，乾菜，調味品，半羊豬肉等，按酒泉市價隨意購買，但逢年按節，則這些物品也要實行定量的分配。在食物方面，甘靑油礦近幾年在謀自給自足，所以附設有嘉峪關，赤金堡，酒泉三處農塲，現有自置田地六百餘畝，租種田地百餘畝，每年可產各種菜蔬三百多萬斤及少數的穀物雜糧，還養着少數牛羊豬隻及家禽，供應肉食次牛奶。</p>
<p>像以上報導這許多廉價的福利品供應，每個人能享受到多少利益？據王課長的統計：大月份每個單身職員享受配價與市價差額的貼差利益總値有三百八十餘萬元，單身長工的總値有九百六十萬元，如果携有眷屬，每戶的總値要在三千萬元以上。</p>
<p>水電燃料　免費享受</p>
<p>携有眷屬的員工，還一律可以免費事受水·電，燃料（渣油或瓦斯氣），傢具，器皿等，前三種是按時送上家門的。　該礦除設有中醫室，有兩個中醫師爲員工療病外，還有一個規模較小的醫院，在醫藥設備與技術方面，最近已與蘭州中央醫院取得合作，分內。外·牙·助產等科，並有化騐室一所，病床三十五張，尙無X光設備；兩個助產士，九個護士和十個醫師，終日忙得不可開交，每月平均共有九千次的診療，醫藥手術都是免費的。這裏過去有手術極佳的外科大夫，現在多已離去，礦區最多的診例是感冒和痢疾，其他傳染病尙少，每月割盲腸的最少有二十起。</p>

<h3>一般物價　商品市塲走勢　大多先漲後回</h3>
<p>自抗戰後期以至勝利後三年來，成爲經濟問題的中心問題之幣制改革，終於在上週五起實行改革了。這一問題，經過政府當局長期的硏議，學者專家無數次的探討，它無疑的是廿四年起實行法幣以來的一件重大措施，對於今後整個經濟的影響，當然不言而喩，茲先於此處一提，本刋當另有專文述之。</p>
<p>上週物價，承前週末勢之後，大多在高峯盤旋，市塲方面，因謠傳熾盛，多空雙方，咸取觀望態度，以靜待新方案之公佈，及至週四幣制改革前夕，傳說益見證實，一般物價，多微趨回落。自週五起，新幣制公佈，滬津兩市證劵交易所奉令暫停營業，非經行政院核准，不得復業。本市金融業，臨時休假二日，同時米糧·麵粉·煤·紗布·絲綢·雜糧·食油·豆餅·捲烟·日用品·五洋雜貨·木材·洋紙·藥材等市塲，亦連帶休假二日，至本週一恢復。上週批發物價總指數爲八，三一八，六一二倍，較前週上升百分之二四·九四倍。</p>
<p>上週國行交換情形，連續之鉅額差出爲以前所未見，計週一差出四萬一千餘億，週三差出三萬四千餘億，週四差出二萬五千餘億，據分析，約由於：（一）償付到期國庫劵本息，（二）軍政公款之支付，及收購糧食麵粉費用。（三）收購結匯證。事後思之，此種收購措施與配合預定之改革幣制，當不無關係，暗息站六角上下。</p>
<p>上週結匯證售價逐步上升，計由週初之七百四十萬，升至週四之七百八十萬。飾金週初兌進價爲每兩五億四千萬，兌出每兩五億八千萬，隔日升二千萬，週三週四未動。銀元因單位小，便於交割關係，供求均多，價上升頗勁，賣價由週初之六百八十萬，升至週四之七百八十萬。</p>
<p>商品市塲走勢，跡象亦大致與前略同。紗布方面如四十二支藍鳳，週初爲廿九億，週二站卅二億五千萬，週四又回至卅一億一千萬；廿一支雙馬，週初爲廿一億五千萬，週二站廿四億七千萬，週四又回至卅三億一千萬。龍頭細布由高峯之九千萬，落至週四之八千八百五十萬。</p>
<p>糧食走勢尙穩，週初上白粳站六千萬，週二至週四約在六千二三百萬之問徘徊。生油盤旋於一億八九千萬，兵船一號粉盤旋二千一二百萬。其他如日用品。化學品。金屬。建築材料等，亦多循此種趨勢，先漲後回。</p>
<p>上週批發物價指數按用途分類者如次：</p>
<p>上週批發物價指數按加工程度分類者如次：</p>
<p>上週批發物價指數按產銷國別分類者如次：</p>
<h3>談新幣制</h3>
<p>醞釀數年來的幣制改革，終於目八月二十日起公布施行了。這在我國貨幣史上，要算廿四年實行法幣以來的一件重大措施。這一次新幣制的誕生，是依據動員戡亂時期臨時條款之規定，由總統以財政經濟緊急處分令頒布的，所以我們對金圓劵的看法，在心情上是很沉重的。</p>
<p>新幣制的本位幣爲金圓劵，每圓之法定含金量爲純金零點二二一七公分，但市面上並無金質之貨幣流通，金圓券亦不能自由購買外匯，所以新幣制是一種虛金本位制，或稱管理的金本位制。</p>
<p>金圓券發行辦法第十條，規定金圓券發行準備之檢査保管，設金圓券發行準備監理委員會辦理之。第十三條規定金圓券發行準備監理委員會，應於每月終了後檢査中央銀行發行金圓券之數額，及發行準備情形，作成檢査報吿書公吿之。這一點發行公開獨立的精神，與當初實行發法幣時大致相似，希望政府應切實遵守到底。</p>
<p>金圓劵發行辦法第八條規定，金圓劵之發行採十足準備制。前項發行準備中必須有百分之四十爲黄金白銀及外匯，其餘以有價證劵，及政府指定之國有事業資產充之，這一點與當初法幣的發行準備規定，現金準備爲百分之六十，保證準備爲百分之四十，略微有點不同。</p>
<p>我們展望金圓劵今後成敗的關鍵，論點雖多，但是要點祗有一個，就是物價是否能穩，物價穩，金圓劵可謂全部成功；物價漲，則今後之經濟危機實不堪想像，所以政府在公布金圓券發行辦法之外，還公布了人民所有金銀外幣處理辦法，中華民國人民存放國外外匯資產登記管理辦法，整理財政及加强管制經濟辦法。一面努力集中外匯資金，平衡政府收支；一面下最大的決心，來平抑今後的物價。</p>
<p>發行辦法第九條規定，金圓劵發行總額以二十億元爲限。按金圓劵一元合三百萬法幣，二十億金圓劵應合六千萬億法幣，據一般估計，目前法幣發行額約為七八百萬億，實値僅及二十億金圓劵之一成餘，因此金圓券的發行，雖然以二十億為限，但短時期絕不可發至足額，因爲社會上一時還不需要如此大量的通貨，問時物資在短期內也不能增加很多倍數。若是金圓劵的發行數量，超過現在法幣發行額的實値倍數過多，物價仍然要上漲的。</p>
<p>整理財政及加强管制經濟辦法第二條，規定切實增進各種稅收，其稅率低於戰前標準者，應參照戰前標準調整之。第三條規定國營公用及交通事業之收費低於戰前標準者，准參照戰前標準調整之，以期自給。此種規定，就政府立塲說來，似乎無可非議，但就整個的物價看，未免太牽強了。因爲捐稅增加了，商人不願負担，也無此能力負担，結果自然轉嫁於消費者身上，物價仍要上漲。國營公用及交通事業增加收費，也會使工商業的生產成本增加，導致物價的上漲。所以政府在執行此項規定時，技術上尤應多多的考慮。</p>
<p>我們檢討法幣信用的喪失，原因雖然很參，但表現的祗有一點，就是物價漲，而每次漲風的前夕，又無不由於游資的泛濫爲災。就新方案者來，規定人民不得持有黄金白銀及外幣，人民若果眞遵照政府規定去掉換金圓券，那末市上的游資，可能比過去還要增加的多，如何切實的疏導游資，以穩定物價於無形，這是一個非常嚴重的問題，公債雖不失爲一個辦法，但過去的效果並不顯著，這一問題還得要當局多多的推敲。</p>
<p>這一次收兌金銀外幣處理辦法，規全銀元一兌二金圓劵，美鈔一兌四金圓券，黄金一兩兌二百金圓劵，但在新方案公布的前夕，銀元黑市價約値二圓五角，美鈔黑市價約値四圓，黄金黑市價約値二百圓弱，就規定的兌換率看，持有銀元者要吃點虧，持有金鈔者要佔點便宜，也可進一步的說，新方案多少是有點偏袒了有錢人的利益，因此我們希望外匯資產登記管理辦法，能迅速的不折不扣的施行，使有錢人對戡亂戰爭多供獻點。</p>
<p>大體的說，新方案多少也有些缺點，但總算差强人意，問題是在能否公平的切實的去執行，以底於成·尤其是在遇到强大的阻力或無勢力時，應當鐵面無私的去克服。</p>
<h3>貨幣·金融　（一）銀根暗息</h3>
<p>本市上週銀根，雖週一値行莊月中發薪之期，需款孔多，而稍感帶歛，但嗣以國庫支出浩大，外埠匯款到達，遂轉見鬆弛。</p>
<p>商業行莊業内恢復拆放，單子充裕，業外頭寸以需單者殷切而稍較喫香。現鈔籌碼雖因廿五萬關金劵問世而稍覺舒和，但以投羅者多，大票貼水仍在百分之五·六左右。</p>
<p>上週週四，當局頒佈財政經濟緊急處分令，宣佈金圓劵發行等四項辦法，自即日起，規定以金頂　位銷，票面分一圓，伍圓，拾圓，伍拾圓，壹百元，等五種，下並設金屬質輔幣，法幣三百萬折合金圓一元，法定兌換期爲三個月，新幣共發行廿億，採十足準備制。其間四成爲金銀外匯準備，醞釀已久的所謂改革幣制，至此始吿實現。又銀錢業爲配合此一緊急措施，週五起即奉令停業二天，故上週金融業行情，爲期不過自週一至週四共四天。</p>
<p>上週暗息，大致　六角左右盤旋，紗布帮貼息約爲日拆三十元，百貨帮日拆在廿五元左右，證券帮塲外貼息多方廿九元，空方廿六元。</p>
<p>國家行局庫交換結果，自週一至週四，共差出九萬四千六百六十八億，但其間週一一天，行局有鉅額庫劵本息，係藉劃帳方法支付，故實際差出當在十萬億以上，銀根之趨鬆，受其影響不小。</p>
<p>外商銀行自週一至週四，共差進七萬七千七百〇九億，除一部份係出售結匯證價款外，據說多爲資金之外逃。</p>
<p>上週六十號以後行莊交換結果，計共差出八千二百四十四億，商業行莊間接交換組尙差進一萬數千億，銀根之轉趨鬆弛，亦可槪見。</p>
<p>（二）華洋股市</p>
<p>華股週初開盤，因利空消息傳說甚濃，在對敲幫，外股帮及銀行帮爭售外，疲態畢露，午後聞銀根鬆動，形勢轉俏，惟多數仍難越過前週末之收盤價。計永紗以一五七〇〇元收盤，較前週未小挫。榮豐，上泥，商務三種軋漲，信誼漲停，餘均微落。</p>
<p>次日因隔前國家行局有鉅額差出，兼之圈外物價紛紛報漲，股市突告陡升，結果各股一致軋漲，並有永紗，永業，華瓷，景綸，動興，榮豐，恒豐，永公，商務，中興，中衣，等十一種躍登漲限。</p>
<p>週三公用事業减價實現，改革幣制傳說又盛，廣帮逢高拋出，市勢回小，永紗以一六九八〇元收盤，他股中永業，上泥，兩種漲停，統益，勤興，中火，中泥，永公，商務，六種軋漲，餘一　　跌。</p>
<p>選四因傳聞新經濟改革方案，及幣制改革等新措施公布在即，人心慌亂，大戶逢高拋售，浮戶紛紛斬割，市氣疲憊，跌風慘烈。結果除華新，上泥兩種漲停外，餘均下降，內永紗，信和，美亞，閘北，勤興，等五種跌停板</p>
<h3>新經濟方案及幣制改革的可能後果</h3>
<p>醞釀已久的新經濟方案及幣制改革，終於在突破了種種謠傳，與一再被否認的烟幕以後，嶄新的出現了。這不能不看作是財政金融界的一件大事，這也不能不認爲是政府再一次改良目前經濟情况的歷史性的嘗試。這樣的嘗試，就站在政府的立塲說，當然會有若干重大的收獲的，至於牠是否對一般人民及工商界有利，除了作種種原則性的推論外，還須等待事實去證明。</p>
<p>不妨硏究硏究新經濟改革方案及幣制改革，所給予政府的可能的收獲。爲分析方便起見，這裏可分幾點來說明：</p>
<p>（一）金銀外匯頭寸的集中：根據所發表的金圓券的發行準備率，其中四成爲金銀及外匯一點來計算，目前國庫所存的金銀及外匯頭寸，約合美金二億元，這與香港遠東經濟評論雜誌，最近所發表的一億五千萬的庫存估計尙相近。現在金圓劵的折換率，旣完全默認了黄金及外匯的黑市價格，（規定美鈔一元可兌値法幣一千二百萬的金圓券），而法令又嚴禁九月三十日後，金銀外幣的流通與持有，故預料一部份小心翼翼的金銀外幣的零星儲蓄者，會吐出其中部或全部的儲蓄，向央行存儲或兌換。此外，有一部份金鈔投機者，因碍於風險，亦可能使其資金轉移於其他用途。至於用爲外逃的資金或外匯頭寸，除非國内局勢整個改觀，否則一紙法令恐仍難改變其去從的方向。再者在變相認黑市價格的有利條件下，僑匯及出口結匯的收入亦可能增加。要之，新方案在集中國内零星金銀及外匯頭寸上，可能有所貢獻，但能集中到何種程度，主要尙決定於政府對人民的信用，因爲金銀國有究竟與土地國有不同，前者是利於害藏與轉運的。</p>
<p>新管制辦法對節省各項有關外匯開支，亦可謂不遺餘力。如「國營公用及交通事業之收費，准參照戰前標準調整之，以期自給。」如「輸入限額，自第七季起，照第五，第六，兩季平均標準，至少核减四分之一。」再如上海等都市，「在辦法公佈後兩個月内，核减各類汽車執照四分之一至三分之一，並嚴格限制汽車用油量。」這說明當局對外匯的便用是如何緊縮，平心而論，這是因爲政府的外匯，一部份已用到戡亂戰爭的緣故。</p>
<p>至於處理在外外歐資產這一問題，顯然比較複雜，第一，所謂「除華僑者外，均應將截至民國三十七年八月二十日止，存放國外之外匯資產……申報登記」云云，「華僑」兩字，未有正確定義。第二，若干豪門，如用外人名義，存放其資產者，將無從査考。第三，除非變更所在國之法律，否則無法「由政府向各該外國政府交涉沒收之。」可知所謂「中華民國人民，存放　外外匯資產登記管理辦法，」與實際施行，恐尙不無相當距離。</p>
<p>（二）關於平衡預算及管理物價者：經濟學界大部份認爲幣制改革的成敗，決定於預算的能否平衡。新方案規定預算平衡的辦法，除鬧了好久的所謂節約開支，出售剩餘物資等等而外，似乎頗着眼於一切實增進各種稅收。」並規定「其稅率低於戰前標準者，應參照前標準調整之。」稅率比照戰前增加，今日工商界能否負担固然是一個問題，因稅率的增加而導致物價上漲，至少可能性也很大，此其一。再如國營公用事業收費，亦比照「戰前標準調整，以期自給，」其對於物價的刺激，亦頗難樂觀，此其二。輸入限額的削减可以使　入品漲價，比其三。輸出結匯的趨近黑市，當然對出口物資是一種刺激，此其四。有關經濟大局的各種因素，彼此息息相關，假如財政上仍有一大漏洞無法挹注，則移東補西，彼此牽連，物價仍不能不漲，原期幣制改革後的若千成果，亦可能一一消失，當局亦有見於此，於是在新方案中，重申加强管制，以穩定新幣的基礎。</p>
<p>（三）利用政治的法令，加强經濟的控制。除上述普遍增加稅收而外，政府且已決定「不得以任何方式作商業性質的放款，」同時「即參照戰前銀行法規定之銀行最低資本額，擬定各區銀行錢莊信託公司之最低資本額，限兩個月內，增至最低資本額，現金增資部份，不得少於百分之五十，」否則，「一律勒令停業，限期淸理。」對於銀錢業之打擎，不可謂不大。不但如此，滬津兩地證劵交易所，已限令暫停營業，而嗣後「報紙，通訊稿，及其他印刷物，不得記載金銀外匯及各種重要日用品之黑市價格。「管制可謂已達登峯造極的地步。至於一般小民所關心的所謂生活指數，亦已變成了歷史上的陳跡。本來，在變相的「凍結」生活指數的方策下，除非物價長期穩定，否則難免造成勞資雙方的對立與衝突，因此新辦法更進一步「禁止封鎖工廠，罷工，怠工，違者依妨害國家總動員法懲罰暫行條例第五條第四款之規定處罰之」。法令對各種物品及勞務價格的所謂能否漲價一節，旣仍附有「其有特殊原因者，非經主管核准，不許加價」的伸縮性需句。則在新法令下將來勞資的糾紛恐仍難免，這的確是需要當局細細考慮並謹愼施行的。</p>
<p>目前對於當局所頒佈的新方案即欲下一斷語，以預測其成敗，固然覺得太早，但理論上的推敲，不但不是多餘，而且是必需的，因爲我們覺得目前經濟危機的嚴重，新幣制祗許成功，不准失敗，囑望過殷，督責自嚴，甚盼當局深加警惕，如何公平的切實的來執行這個新揹施。</p>

<h3>國立英士大學</h3>
<p>— 本報金華記者　蔣風</p>
<p>烽火中誕生·戰地上成長·在安定中求進步！</p>
<p>〔本報金華通訊〕英大，在國內各國立大學中是一位年幼的小弟弟。創設英大的動機，是在民國二十七年，當時東南各大學先後遭受敵人威脅而內遷，高中畢業學生受交通的限制，未能去内地求學者甚衆。浙省當局有鑒及此，蓄意創立大學，以資收容不能遠赴後方求學之靑年，經過省府一〇二五次會議通過，派許紹棣，谷正綱，阮敬成，黄祖培，任延颺，趙曾珏，王結，黄祝民等爲籌備委員，負責籌備。民國二十八年十月籌備完成，當時東戰場戰事正極激烈，英大便在烽火中誕生了。浙省政府原擬定名爲浙江省立戰時大學，藉以培養戰時需要之人才，以應抗建之需。後敎部以大學須具永久性，而蔣總統早有創立大學以紀念先烈陳英士先生之意，而英士先生恰爲浙江人，遂正式定名爲英士大學。</p>
<p>三十二年初春，陳立夫接長敎部，認爲該校有調整擴充之必要，逐決定將英大改爲國立；一方面將東南聯大法學院藝專科劃英歸大，一方面將工學院拆出單獨成立國立北洋工學院。並代浙省辦理行政·財政·會計三專修科。那時設有農·醫·法三學院，藝術·合作·行政·財政·會計五專條，三十三年夏季，朱家驊接長敎育部，重新調整高等敎育，乃將英大醫學院歸併浙江省立醫學專科學校辦理，（原因學制不同，英大近已呈准繼續設立醫學院，待校舍問題解決，即可恢復。）北洋工學校重又劃歸英大，成立工學院，合作·藝術專科停辦。三十五年秋季，由何故校長呈准添辦文理學院·行政·財政·會計三專修先後結束，不再繼續招生。</p>
<p>現在英大除醫學院尙待逐步恢復外，計有四院十七系。文理學院設有中國文學系，歷史學系，物理學系，數學系；另有哲學系，化學系及外國文學系尚未招生。法學院設有經濟學系，政治學系，法律學系（内分行政法學，理論法學及司法三組。）農學院設有農藝學系，農業經濟學系，森林學系，畜收學系。工學院設有土木工程系，化學工程系，機械工　系，電機工程系。</p>
<p>歷任校長都認爲人事方面量重要的是敎授；敎授好，學校便好，「有敎授，就有學校」。但以僻居浙省內地，交通不若京滬便利，延聘名流，較感困難，然幾年來，歷任對於敎授之延聘都很努力。現任校長湯吉未。敎務長蔡賓牟·訓導長趙希獻·總務長閻據華。敎授方面亦頗多知名之士，如文理學院的聞詩·査猛濟·張宗元·姜亮天·楊得雲；法學院的朱祖晦，梅仲協·趙文炳·劉支藩；農學院的范雲遷·方悌·徐陡·王濱海；工學院的王珪孫·王子瑜·王祖蘊·蔣潮等。</p>
<p>現在校學生約近千人，因限於尚無永久校舍，不能儘量招收。本年畢業學生約有一百六十餘人。</p>
<p>復員後的英大，曾稍有動盪，最　困難的實在是校舍問題。遷到金華後，除文理學院有興建臨時校舍一所，其他各院校苦及總辦公廳，均係租借，修理應用，多屬臨時性質。關於校舍建築事，湯校長曾盡力籌措，但以經費過鉅，非目前敎育部財力所能負担，只得逐步進行。現已動定金華北山之麓，離城八里許之高村地方，擬以募捐方式，　集鉅款，興建英士紀念廳及英士圖書館各一座，已成立委員會專責進行。其他院舍擬請敎部陸續撥款建造，以期逐步實現。這也就是湯吉禾校長的「要從安定裏求準步」的做法，英大顯然是逐漸步向光明了。</p>
<h3>本市第二屆　學生游泳賽　男女生百餘人參加　後天在虹口池舉行</h3>

<h3>也談好萊塢</h3>
<p>— 史郁</p>
<p>好萊塢影饗了千萬人的行爲與道德，控制了千萬人的思想與情緒。它越俎代庖的爲你決定了人生觀；並非故意的爲你舖下了生活的道路。你是好玩着上電影院的，但出得門來，牠已—敎育—了你。蓓蒂葛蘭賓的大腿，瓊克勞福的雙肩，　不僅僅娛樂了你。情塲老手却爾斯鮑育已成了多少善感的哥兒們的示範？亂世佳人一經開演，那册「隨風而去的小說竟額外地銷了一百萬册。凡此種種足以表示好萊塢目有一股深入人心的力量，但那股力量是好是壞，便値得考慮了。皇免雜誌就頗有這逍個雄心去答覆這個問題，它發出了幾百封信，徵集了各方面的意見。大槪除了製片商及電影老闆，便沒有不攻擊好萊塢的。他們列舉了十二條罪狀，將「家　」完全道了出來。</p>
<p>好萊塢最大的罪狀是歪曲事實，給人們病態的敎育。敎育家，歷史家大聲攻擊傳記片的不忠實：說蘇彝十一中泰羅鮑華將莊嚴的李塞浦氏飾成風流小生；「一曲難忘」也荒誕地描繪了蕭邦的一生。好萊塢常常極不尊敬的描寫計多有專業的人，以至使人們覺得美國新聞記者大都是酗酒的，律師大都是刁惡的，精神病醫生大都是幼稚的。好萊塢的嘲笑非白種人，最足以阻碍國際間的了解。我們在銀幕上所看到的黑人，不是拉長了險在跳踢躂舞，使是洋琴鬼之類。一般人幾乎不曉得在美國也還有黑人的敎育家，實業家等。直至今日爲止，大凡銀幕上有中國人，那麽壽衣，小辮子，水烟壺等等也就還是要搬了出來，以博白人一笑。好萊塢的鼓勵酗酒，製造離婚，刺激犯罪，社會學家在二十年前早已嘖有煩言。一個少婦向法官陳說離婚的理由：「那個女明星不是已離婚五次了嗎？一各種標新立異的戀愛片，使人們的貞操觀念日趨淡薄，視婚姻似兒戯，很多人就覺得離婚是可炫耀的，因此離婚案山積。少年犯罪的增加，頗多是受了詹姆士賈克奈式的所謂「身是膽」的暗示。大概每個昌期有三千三百萬個美國少爺上電影院，影院老闆見了這批少爺就頭痛，因爲他們常常鑿破座位，在正廳裏作彈弓之　，甚至還要縱火！</p>
<p>好萊塢在中國，也已有幾十年的歷史了。在這個都市裏，與它結不解緣的恐怕已不在少數。但好萊塢已給了我們什麼呢？我有不少的朋友每星期非看三次西片不可。而且他們是從來不加選擇的。我確信他們從好萊塢得來的一敎育」要比學校裘得來的更多。他們幾乎都是聰明伶俐，修飾得十分整齊，打着口哨，聳着兩肩。一切都有充分的牛油　息。他們都在追求着一個狀元的夢。這個「狀元一許多歐洲人也在追求着，就是：「五萬美金一年的進益，電冰箱，轎車，以及當你覺得煩惱時，隨時可以離婚」。</p>
<p>我們給了好萊塢大量的外匯，好萊塢自然也得給我們一點什麽了！</p>

<h3>朱自清先生之死（下）</h3>
<p>— 謝冰瑩</p>
<p>以上是關於自淸先生的履歷和他的著作的介紹，底下我還想叙述一點他的病和他的貧苦狀况，想來也是讀者最關心而願意知道的。</p>
<p>遠在二十年前，自淸先生便有了十二指腸發炎的毛病，民國三十年，據說曾有一次在成都某醫院照過X光，發現有胃潰瘍的徵象，但自淸先生毫不注意，他把整個精神寄託在學術的研究上，忘記了自己的健康。從今年五月起，他的身體衰弱到了極點，從來不請假的，他如今也請起假來了。到了八月六日的淸晨，突然肚子痛的厲害，他還以爲是盲腸炎，當天上午十一點就進北大附屬醫院治療，經醫生檢査照相的結果，斷定是胃潰瘍，於下午兩點施行手術，費時四十分鐘，經過很好，在施手術的時候，發現十二指腸爛了一個大約有半英寸長，四分之一英寸大的洞，於是醫生趕快給他縫好。據張大夫說，普通病人開刀，實行全身麻醉時，用藥量有多至二百或三百西西者，而這次對於自淸先生，恐怕他受不了，僅用了一百西西，淸醒後，他的精神很好，還對來看他的朋友說：「手術眞快，一刻鐘就完了！」</p>
<p>第二天，檢査小便，發現有蛋白，顆粒性管型，醫生斷定有腎臟炎。這時内外各科醫生都詳加研究，最難解決的問題是如果單患胃潰瘍，不能吃飯，可以多注射一點葡萄糖和鹽水，但加上腎臟炎就麻煩了，因爲這是與前者相反的，不能打葡萄糖和鹽水。據張大夫說，朱先生自從住院以來，熱度並不高，始終在三十七度左右，只是小便很少，四天之後，有時手足發冷，到了十一號，小便漸漸地多起來，臉色也沒有前幾天的蒼白了，似乎恢復了正常，當天晚上還有大便。可是到了第二天，情形又變了，當九點二十分朱先生因爲大便而用力過度的時候，突然感覺呼吸特別困難起來，本來這幾天都是用養氣在帮助他呼吸，注射葡萄糖與血漿。到了十一點半鐘的時候，朱先生的生命已到了最危險的階段，他的脈搏停止，最後一口呼吸斷絕，他是帶着無限的傷痛與留戀，與這汚穢的，混亂的塵世長辭了！</p>
<p>他在臨終的時候，據說只說了一句話，聲音很微細：「大夫們都盡了他們的力了！」最後，他向最小的女兒招手，女兒走近，他看了最後一眼，便閉目了。</p>
<p>朱夫人陳竹隱女士，親眼看到最親的人死了，當時即暈過去了，醒來第一句話是：「趕快給你大哥二哥去電報！」可憐他們的二公子閏生十一號還從南京電匯一筆款來，誰知他的父親已不能受用了。</p>
<p>自淸先生遺有四男四女，原配與繼配各生四人，最小的女兒，還只有十歲，在清華成志小學讀書，這是他最鐘愛的一個小寳貝。自淸先生一生廉潔淸高，死後殯殮時，連一件像樣的衣服也找不出，眞够慘了！</p>
<p>一般文人，幾乎都有一種共同的習慣，都不喜歡塡什麼履歷表，有一次某名敎授在他的履歷表上，寫上「一個老翁」四字寄回給他敎書的學校。自淸先生的脾氣也有點相彷彿，他從來不喜歡塡表。國立北平圖書館曾請他塡表，他說「我生平不高興塡表，恕不遵命。今年春天，又寄去一張，仍然請他塡，他回信說：「我在敎書的時候，往往要向學生介紹某一個作家的時候，感到材料的缺乏，很不方便。這次你們要我塡表，我決不拒絕了！」（大意如此）於是他塡了一個很詳細的表，本文關于自淸先生的履歷及著作，即根據他親自塡的表而寫成的。</p>
<p>自淸先生死了，他的軀殼雖已火化成灰，但他的精神是寄託在他的著作上，影饗了千千萬萬的知識靑年，永遠不朽，永遠在文壇上放出燦爛的光輝！（三十七年八月十五日，於故都。）晋霖</p>

<p>— 索貝</p>
<p>揚州江邊六圩鎭，本月十六日轟然一饗，全部陸沉，昔日市街繁榮，不留絲毫痕跡，曾爲交通樞紐商旅駐足的小社會，已隨滔滔東流，逝於俄頃！桑田滄海，人事無常，可視爲宇宙間的常理，亦可視爲「萬物之靈」者的悲哀，他們的當貴豪華，凡百文明，正往往建築於隨時（或者無數年後）可以陸沉的沙灘上。</p>
<p>且莫議我「危言聳聽」：六圩鎭旣可沉於頃刻，上海灘便難保不會坍於刹那！上海地層不是每年往下低落一二吋嗎？整個綠洲且難斷言其永無盡頭之日，何况滬凟這塊冲積而成的沙灘？</p>

<p>古老的舊都最近又去世了一位古老的舊學家。盧靖，字木齋，湖北舉人，前清直隸及奉天兩任提學使，以藏書及考古著名，於本月十日下午病逝，壽登九十有四！加閏算，可抵百齡矣。此翁與江西李盛鐸（己在榜眼，已故多年）收藏之富，鑑別之精，旗鼓相當，妙在都以「木齋」爲號。</p>
<p>八月八日爲父親節，題字（見是日本報銅版）之吳稚暉老先生，八十四歲，比一般古稀叟還超過十餘齡，可謂壽之特高者，而尙小於盧叟十年也。閩省九十大慶之薩老將軍（鎭冰），比盧尙小四歲也。上海寓公陳老督（夔龍）今九十有二，老於薩者二齡，仍少於盧二齡也。（編者按：陳庸老已於八月十七日逝世。）法國維喜偽府貝當元帥一九四零對德乞和時已八十有四（合華齡八十五），而今應是九十有二（華齡九十三），比盧尙差一數也。</p>
<p>吳叟之題墨以「父」字之古篆與新式分析合參甚趣。按所謂「父親節一，原係五年前寓居上海之顏惠慶博士，梅蘭芳博士，及其他聞人聯合主張，理由是「惟父惟母，並稱並重。知有父而不知有母，固失人情之常，知有母而不知有父，寗非痛心之事？一是情文兼摯之駢詞，而解釋字形曰：「八八聯綴，形同父字，而音又與爸爸相似。」亦見巧思。</p>
<p>父母之輕重親疏，一言難盡。大概人類初期，宗法不備，生於母身，長於母懷，故知有毌不知有父，後世家庭確立，倫理漸明，男權優越，婦須從夫，父母關係，顯分軒輊。父之宗親，視同家長，母系則爲「外家」。雖一堂之上，父母並稱，而以家族言，幾於「知有父不知有母」矣。西俗家庭雖亦重男姓，而內外家之親疏，則無差別。故羅斯福與其「堂姊妹」結婚。中國則以「表」而婚爲常事，若以「堂」而配偶則爲「亂倫」—那還了得？其實伯叔之與舅，姑之與姨，同輩之堂與表，在父母兩邊距離，完全相等，兩方之同稱乃極合理者。至於西方之有母親節，據說是軍人從役，老母倚閶，或軍役死亡，母之悲痛與失望更甚於父，故有母親節之特典自有原因，非於二親之間故爲偏重。中闕名流規定「父親節」，未爲不可，亦不必作不平之鳴，並存或各行其是可也。</p>
<p>（編者按：西洋亦有父親節，子女皆於是日以禮物獻父，惟節日爲每年六月中之第三個星期日，此則與我國之父親節不同。）</p>

<h3>Presidential Encouragement to the Nation: Stabilize the Economy and Government through Agreement, Uphold Laws and Complete the Great Undertaking of Reconstruction</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Bureau, 22nd] The President, determined to earnestly implement the emergency measures for financial and economic management and to thoroughly eliminate lurking spies and bandits, issued a statement on the current situation and major government measures. The Director of the Executive Yuan's Information Bureau, Dong Xian Guang, held a press conference at 5 p.m. on the 22nd, immediately announcing the statement and expressing the hope that the national press would assist in disseminating it to accomplish this task. Director Dong also stated at the conference that the President had originally intended to meet with reporters personally to discuss the matter, but was unable to do so due to other affairs, which demonstrates the President's emphasis on the matter. The conference proceeded swiftly, with Director Dong adjourning the meeting immediately after announcing the President's statement.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 22nd] President Chiang recently issued a statement on the current situation and major government measures. The full text is as follows:</p>
<p>At the beginning of the victory of the War of Resistance, all of our compatriots throughout the country had fervent hopes for the post-war economic recovery and improvement of living standards. Zhong Zheng especially focused on establishing a foundation for national construction and cultivating talent for construction, hoping to work together with all compatriots throughout the country to realize our Three Principles of the People, the ideal of national construction. It has been three years since the end of the War of Resistance. If there had been no rebellion by the treacherous bandits and communists, the economic lives of our people and the national construction endeavors would have already achieved unprecedented progress in a stable environment, advancing together with democratic countries towards recovery and prosperity. However, the communist bandits have been deliberately plotting to endanger the integrity of our territorial sovereignty, undermine the foundation of our national unity and independence, destroy the glorious history of our nation's victory, and our position of freedom and equality. They are acting perversely, insisting on their bandit path of armed rebellion, cruel slaughter, and massacre, causing the current situation of national devastation and the people's suffering.</p>
<p>Now that the communist bandits have taken advantage of the weakness of our post-war economic devastation and the exhaustion of the military and civilians to launch a full-scale rebellion for three years, their violence, after this long-term rebellion, has still failed to subvert our national foundation and destroy our people's lives. Therefore, they will be even less able to achieve their goal of selling out the country and enslaving the nation in the future. Especially in the past year, they have used land reform as a deceptive slogan and liquidation as a means of coercion, engaging in exhaustive exploitation of manpower and resources in the bandit areas, attempting a final desperate gamble against the government. However, the facts have proven that the communist bandits' so-called "one-year plan" has failed. Their military adventures have not achieved their expected goals, and their brutal struggles have backfired. Famine has been created in the bandit areas, and the people in the bandit areas have also awakened and begun to resist the treacherous bandits. Therefore, the treacherous bandits have had to use political offensives to conceal their fundamental failure, inciting young students in our rear areas, opening up their so-called "second front," and instigating peripheral elements to launch their so-called "anti-war and peace-seeking" movement in order to disrupt our social order and obstruct our mobilization for suppressing the rebellion. Among them, a small number of people who are not clearly aware, incited by the bandits, and echoing their sentiments, are transferring the responsibility for all the tragic situations caused by the treacherous bandits' use of cruel massacres and terror control to the government, even blaming the government for creating a civil war. They are unaware that today's government's military operations to suppress the bandits are for defending the integrity of territorial sovereignty and for maintaining the position of independence and freedom. In essence, it is a continuation of the national war of the eight-year War of Resistance. If the country's unification and independence are not achieved for a single day, and the suffering and poisoning of our compatriots in the bandit areas are not alleviated for a single day, then the duty of our patriotic military and civilians to suppress bandits and quell the rebellion cannot be abandoned for a single day. Otherwise, the victorious fruits gained by all compatriots throughout the country through bloodshed and sacrifice during the eight-year War of Resistance will not only be impossible to preserve, but the entire nation and people will be enslaved and will never have a chance to rise again.</p>
<h3>Harming the Credit of the New Currency is to be an Enemy of the Entire People - The People Should Rise Up to Correct and Report</h3>
<p>However, the government does not abandon its work of national construction because of the ongoing military operations to suppress bandits. At this time, after a long period of war, when the treacherous bandits are in full-scale rebellion, the legal currency is gradually entering a stage of malignant inflation, and the national economy and the people's livelihood are all severely threatened. The government has had to resolutely reform the currency system. The issuance of the Gold Yuan Certificates this time has undergone careful deliberation, sufficient preparations have been made, a sound system has been established, and finances have been reorganized and the economy managed to ensure the successful implementation of the currency reform. Zhong Zheng also holds firm beliefs and determination to implement the four measures promulgated in the Emergency Decree on Financial and Economic Disposal. In the future, the progress of national construction and the stability of the people's lives will depend on stable currency values and prices. All patriotic compatriots will surely unanimously support this new currency policy, and should especially thoroughly recognize that this currency reform is not only the foundation for the reorganization of national finances, but also the prerequisite for the stability of the people's livelihood. It must be known that the government is the government of all the people of the country, and the country is also the country of all the people of the country. As the ancients said, "If the skin is gone, what will the hair cling to?" At a time when the treacherous bandits are rampant and the national situation is severe, the people, the country, and the government are closely related in terms of fortune, misfortune, honor, and disgrace, and there is absolutely no difference in terms of survival and demise. The people's support for the country's new currency is the way to stabilize their own livelihoods. The people's obedience to the government's laws and decrees is also the way to protect their own rights. It is hoped that all compatriots throughout the country will understand that they have become an inseparable part of the country and the government. Therefore, the people and the government should not only trust and help each other and cooperate seamlessly, but also the people should persuade each other and encourage each other to fully support the policy of reforming the currency system and thoroughly implement the laws and decrees for controlling the economy. If a small number of people disregard the overall situation and only seek private gain, continuing the practices of the period when the legal currency depreciated, manipulating the new currency as a tool for speculation and monopoly to harm its credit, that is to destroy the livelihoods of all the people of the country, and they are the public enemies of all the people of the country. The government will naturally, in accordance with the National General Mobilization Law and criminal regulations, treat them as treacherous bandits who sell out the country and impose severe sanctions on them. The people should also rise up to correct and report them, assist the government, and complete this policy for the sake of the country and the people, stabilizing the economy, and guaranteeing the people's livelihood. In the past ten years, the legal currency system has completed its mission of supporting the War of Resistance and national construction. It is firmly believed that from today onwards, the gold currency system will also be able to contribute to the ultimate success of the great cause of national construction.</p>
<h3>Plots to Incite Youth - Decisively Will Not Sit Idly By and Watch it Spread</h3>
<p>Encourage the Restoration of a Spirit of Integrity and Awareness of Shame</p>
<p>National construction must have its material conditions, but it must also have its spiritual driving force. Universities are the gardens for cultivating construction talent, and even more so, the source of the spirit of national construction. However, today, the communist bandits are burying spies within universities in various places, inciting and organizing students, sacrificing their studies, destroying their rationality for suppressing rebellion and building the country, and making them take on the urban work and internal lines of the bandit army. They are also daring to spread poison in the minds of young university students, in order to destroy our national history and culture, and to undermine the national consciousness and scientific cultivation that are essential for construction talent. The government will never sit idly by and watch this crime of undermining the new life of our nation spread. Even in the midst of the country's financial difficulties, it is still doing its utmost to maintain the public expenses of university students and provide relief to students who have fled from the bandit areas, showing utmost care for young people. However, it will no longer condone actions that harm the country and society under the direction of the treacherous bandits. Therefore, it has issued orders to investigate communist spies, paying particular attention to eliminating conspiratorial elements among young university students, in order to protect the safety of schools and the studies of young people.</p>
<p>At this time of national survival and honor, it is hoped that all compatriots throughout the country will trust the government, abide by laws and decrees, establish a sound and healthy currency system, abandon speculative and monopolistic behavior, refrain from waste, advocate thrift and economy, maintain the traditional virtues of diligence and frugality of our Chinese people, restore the inherent spirit of integrity and awareness of shame of our nation, report treacherous bandits and spies, maintain social order, protect the safety of schools, and cherish the studies of young people. In this way, suppressing rebellion and building the country will advance simultaneously, and the entire country will work together with one heart to realize the Three Principles of the People and complete the National Revolution, so as to bring comfort to the spirits in heaven of the soldiers and revolutionary martyrs who sacrificed themselves for the War of Resistance and suppressing the bandits.</p>
<h3>Premier Weng Visits the President to Report on the Current Situation</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Bureau, 22nd] Premier of the Executive Yuan Weng Wenhao again visited the President at Beijige at around 10 a.m. on the 22nd to report on various situations after the promulgation of the Emergency Decree on Financial and Economic Disposal. Before Weng's visit to the President, Minister of Finance Wang Yunwu visited Weng's official residence on Xiangya Road and talked for several tens of minutes. Several other heads of relevant ministries and commissions also visited Premier Weng on the morning of the 22nd to make inquiries.</p>
<h3>If There Are Any Who Increase Prices Without Authorization, They Will Be Transferred to the Special Criminal Court for Punishment - Premier Weng Re-Orders All Provinces and Cities to Strictly Enforce</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 22nd] Premier Weng Wenhao specially telegraphed all provincial and municipal governments again on the 22nd, reiterating that the prices of all items in all localities should be based on August 19 as the highest standard, and that no price increases should be made without authorization. Those who violate this order should be transferred to the Special Criminal Court for severe punishment if the circumstances are serious. The original order is as follows: To all provincial and municipal governments: Regarding the Emergency Decree on Financial and Economic Disposal, the most important task for all provincial and municipal governments at present is to control the prices of all items in the local area, based on August 19 as the highest standard. No price increases shall be made without authorization. Those who violate this order shall be subject to administrative penalties in accordance with the regulations, and those whose circumstances are serious shall be transferred to the Special Criminal Court for severe punishment in accordance with the Regulations on Punishing Crimes Endangering the Nation During the Period of Suppressing Rebellion, in order to deter others. Local governments must strictly enforce this order and must not show any leniency. It is hoped that the implementation situation will be reported at any time as required.</p>
<h3>Rumor Has it That a Large Team of American Flying Fortresses Will Be Transferred from Guam to Qingdao - Repair of Chengyang Airport to Be Used for Military Purposes</h3>
<p>[Our Qingdao Bureau, 20th] Two squadrons of American Flying Fortresses will be transferred from Guam to Qingdao and will frequently visit Pingjin. This information was revealed by the American side, and it is understood that Major General Si Mai Shen, leader of the Air Force Group of the American Military Advisory Group, had previously come here from Pingjin for inspection, which is related to this matter. The Qingdao airport is currently undergoing major adjustments. The current Cangku Airport is 18 kilometers away from the urban area and is too small. It houses a large squadron of fighter planes from the US Marine Corps and some naval transport planes, as well as two squadrons of the Chinese Air Force, and also serves as a civil aviation airport, which is already very crowded. In the future, it will be used exclusively for civilian purposes (including the civil aviation brigade). The Chengyang Airport, which has been abandoned, is 31 kilometers away from the urban area and will be used exclusively for military purposes by China and the United States. The airport can accommodate more than 300 aircraft. Cangku Airport is close to the harbor and is often disturbed by fog, while Chengyang is not. During the war, the Japanese army specially designated it for military use. The repair work can be completed as early as two weeks later.</p>
<h3>Employees of State-Run Enterprises - Salaries According to New Regulations</h3>
<p>Executive Yuan Orders Cancellation of Excessive Portions</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 22nd] The Executive Yuan recently issued a circular to direct agencies and relevant ministries and commissions to forward it to their subordinate state-run enterprises, strictly implementing the employee salary standards stipulated in the economic control measures, that is, the actual income per person, in addition to being able to add up to 30% more than the income of civil servants of the same level, the portion exceeding this limit shall be cancelled uniformly. The original order is as follows: It is stipulated in Article 21 of the Emergency Decree on Financial and Economic Disposal "Measures for Reorganizing Finances and Strengthening Economic Control" that the salaries of employees of state-run enterprises shall be converted into Gold Yuan Certificates in accordance with the provisions of Articles 18, 19, and 20, and the actual income per person, in addition to being able to add up to 30% more than the income of civil servants of the same level in accordance with the salary measures for employees of state-run enterprises, the portion exceeding this limit shall be cancelled uniformly. This measure shall be implemented from August 20 of this year. The salaries of all employees of state-run enterprises shall be strictly checked and handled in accordance with the provisions of this article from August of this year. It is not allowed to delay compliance on the pretext that there was previously a special approval for the opposition case, nor is it allowed to make any changes in any name. In addition to separate orders, this order is issued to be strictly followed and implemented, and the implementation situation shall be reported within days after the document arrives. In addition to separate orders, this order.</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 22nd] Regarding the economic control supervision matters in Guangzhou, the central government originally dispatched Huo Baoshu to Guangzhou to assist Song, who is also a supervising commissioner, Ziwen, in handling the matter. It is reported that Huo is suffering from stomach problems and is currently recuperating in Qingdao, and will not be able to come to Beijing in the short term. The government believes that this control work is of great importance, and has added Qin Fen to fly to Guangzhou immediately to discuss the matter in detail with Song in order to facilitate progress.</p>
<h3>Foreign Military and Civilians in Qingdao - Must Use Gold Yuan Certificates</h3>
<p>China and the United States Have Reached an Agreement</p>
<p>[Our Qingdao Bureau, 22nd] The municipal government issued a single emergency measure on the 22nd, stipulating that foreign military and civilians in the city must use Gold Yuan Certificates. If anyone is found buying or selling gold or foreign currency, they will be dealt with in accordance with Article 1 of the penalty regulations.

China and the United States reached an agreement at 4 p.m. on the 22nd in the Baigeer flagship, establishing four exchange numbers for the Central Bank to facilitate the American military.</p>
<h3>Sun Ke Banquets Legislators Staying in Beijing - Discussing Preparations for the Resumption of the Legislative Yuan</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Bureau, 22nd] President of the Legislative Yuan Sun Ke hosted a grand banquet at the Overseas Chinese Reception Center at noon on the 22nd, entertaining more than 200 members of the Legislative Yuan staying in Beijing, and invited senior officials of the Legislative Yuan to accompany them.

<h3>Resignation En Masse of Employees of the Hebei Supervisory Office</h3>
<p>Dissatisfaction with the New Supervisor, Hao Yulin</p>
<p>[Our Beiping Bureau, 22nd] Employees of the Hebei Supervisory Envoy's Office suddenly submitted their resignations en masse and will publish an article entitled "Such a Supervisor" to explain the reasons. Workers who resigned claimed that the new supervisor, Hao Yulin, was elected from Tianjin, and the Tianjin Provisional Council had impeached Hao for abusing his power and selling the council's cars, and therefore they were unwilling to be his subordinates. Another worker claimed that when the new supervisor arrived, he immediately asked how many workers there were, how many cars there were, and how many houses there were, and they were unwilling to sit and wait to be laid off, so they resigned first.</p>
<p>[Our Lanzhou Bureau, 22nd] The Gansu, Ningxia, and Qinghai Supervisory Commissioners' Office will be established on September 1. The new director of the office, Wang Xinling, flew to Lanzhou from Beijing on the 21st, and the handover from the original supervisory envoy is ready.</p>
<h3>Yan Yangchu Arrives in Chongqing from Beijing</h3>
<p>Discussing Detailed Rules for Rural Implementation</p>
<p>[Our Chongqing Bureau, 22nd] Yan Yangchu, a member of the Sino-American Joint Commission on Rural Reconstruction, flew to Chongqing from Beijing. This trip was to discuss detailed rules for rural implementation with his close friend Sun Zirang, commissioner of the three districts of Sichuan. Sun has a large-scale experimental area in Bishan. The second purpose is to preside over the opening ceremony of the Chongqing Rural Construction College.</p>
<h3>Appealing for Redress of Grievances - Former Consul in Songkhla, Siam - Qiu Shouyu Hosts Reporters</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Bureau, 22nd] Qiu Shouyu, the former consul of our country's consulate general in Songkhla, Siam, hosted reporters in Beijing on the 22nd. In addition to reporting on the situation of overseas Chinese in southern Siam, he also appealed to the media to support his redress of the injustice of being framed and dismissed by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs with a four-country punishment. Qiu is one of our country's few experts on Southeast Asian issues, proficient in Malay, and also knows Min and Cantonese dialects. He once served as a specialized member of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and has written many works. When he accompanied Special Envoy Li Di to comfort the Dutch East Indies two years ago, he made great contributions. Later, when the Ministry of Foreign Affairs established a consulate general in Songkhla, southern Siam, he was appointed as consul and went to open the consulate with Consul General Yan Wanli, assisting in everything and gaining the support and faith of the local overseas Chinese. Qiu is a scholar by nature and is upright, which led to resentment from others. Three months ago, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs received a letter falsely using the name of the Songkhla Overseas Chinese Group, imitating Qiu's handwriting. There were many criticisms of Consul General Yan, and it recommended that Qiu be appointed as Consul General. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs was deceived and suspected that it was Qiu's doing, and immediately ordered Qiu to return to China. After Qiu returned to China, he learned the truth and strongly denied the injustice, emphasizing that even if he was foolish, he would not write a letter himself to recommend himself. How could he be subject to such a decisive punishment because of a baseless letter? He requested that the authorities of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs thoroughly investigate the matter. However, after the Ministry of Foreign Affairs requested the Criminal Division of the Internal Affairs Police Headquarters to identify the handwriting, it also recognized that it was written by Qiu. Qiu believes that he was convicted of "unfounded charges" and that his reputation and career have both been damaged. He has decided to apply to the higher authorities and, if necessary, plans to appeal to the Control Yuan to thoroughly investigate the whole matter. Qiu said at the end that he will write "Impressions of Traveling in Siam" to report on the hardships of overseas Chinese.</p>
<h3>Sino-American Jointly Establish Implementation Agencies to Utilize US Aid Cotton - Petroleum Procurement is Under Negotiation</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Bureau, 22nd] The US Aid Utilization Committee and the China Branch of the US Economic Cooperation Administration are scheduled to hold their third joint meeting on the afternoon of the 25th. Regarding Lai Bohan's proposal to utilize US aid cotton, China and the United States will establish an implementation agency to jointly handle the matter. China and the United States have reached an agreement on discussions in Shanghai in the near future, and a decision will be made at the meeting on the 25th. In addition, how to calculate the US aid account after our country's currency system reform may also be discussed on the 25th. At that time, Steelman will also report on his trip back to the United States. Lai Bohan is scheduled to return to Beijing from Qingdao on the 24th to attend.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Bureau, 22nd] Several batches of food and cotton from US aid materials have been transported to China one after another, but petroleum has not been purchased and transported due to the impact of Section 202 of the US Public Law (793). The article stipulates that "US aid funds shall not be used for bulk purchases of materials outside the United States when the price exceeds the price of purchases within the United States." The petroleum in US aid materials needs to be purchased outside the borders of the United States and is subject to the restrictions of the above article, so the US Economic Cooperation Administration has not issued the disbursement order and the authorization to purchase, making it impossible to purchase. China is currently discussing a solution to this problem with the US, hoping to obtain results within two weeks. After this problem is resolved, the petroleum in US aid materials can be purchased and shipped to China.</p>
<h3>Implementing the Self-Help Program</h3>
<p>Currency Reform is a Concrete Manifestation</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Bureau, 22nd] Regarding the implementation of US aid in conjunction with the implementation of the self-help program and the specific implementation methods, we originally planned to provide the US with reference materials before the end of August. Recently, due to the implementation of currency reform by our government, the ministries and commissions have not been able to submit the implementation of the self-help program and implementation methods to the US Aid Committee due to the implementation of the new economic measures. Therefore, the time for us to submit this information to the US may be slightly extended, but the latest date for submitting this information will be the beginning of September. The Emergency Decree on Financial and Economic Disposal promulgated by our President this time, the implementation of currency reform, reorganization of finances, and strengthening of economic control are concrete manifestations of the implementation of the self-help program.</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Looking at Shanghai's Prices Today – After Reading President Chiang's Speech –</h3>
<p>Following the government's promulgation of the Emergency Measures for Finance and Economy on the 19th of this month, all silver and money exchanges and various trading markets nationwide were closed for two days. Yesterday was also a regular Sunday holiday, and they will reopen today with the start of the issuance of the new currency, the Gold Yuan note. Although the legal tender can be used concurrently with the Gold Yuan note until November 20th, all prices from today onward will be marked in Gold Yuan notes, and whether they can be fully converted from the prices before the 19th into Gold Yuan notes will be a major key to the success or failure of this currency reform. President Chiang, therefore, delivered an important speech yesterday in the capital, hoping on the one hand that the people of the country and the government would trust and cooperate with each other, and that people would advise each other to help the government implement the laws and complete this important task of currency reform; on the other hand, he warned the people of the country that if there were still speculative manipulations and disturbances in the financial sector, they would be severely sanctioned in accordance with the General Mobilization Law and criminal regulations. The people of the country were deeply moved upon hearing these words. Whether the general prices in the Shanghai market today can be fully converted from the prices before the 19th into Gold Yuan notes without any fluctuations can be considered a touchstone for whether the citizens of Shanghai are determined to support the national policy.</p>
<p>The central government has always regarded Shanghai as the economic hub of the country. The rise and fall of Shanghai's prices are enough to influence prices throughout the country; therefore, the government's currency reform this time also pays special attention to whether Shanghai's prices will fluctuate. President Chiang has repeatedly stated that he hopes that the financial and industrial circles in Shanghai can lead and assist the government in completing the task. The earnest expectation makes the citizens of Shanghai even more aware of the importance of the responsibilities they bear. According to usual practice, Shanghai's prices will certainly not fluctuate today, causing the well-born new currency to suffer setbacks as soon as it is born, causing pain to those close to it and pleasing the enemy.</p>
<p>To be fair, the government has undertaken this currency reform with great determination. From any angle, it is worthy of the people's sincere support. Its importance is truly as President Chiang said: "This currency reform is truly related to the prosperity, decline, fortune, and misfortune of the entire nation and people." Taking a step back, even if one does not consider the interests of the country and only considers personal interests, one should still wholeheartedly assist the government in completing the currency reform. The reason is simple: First, before the death of the legal tender, it had indeed reached the beginning stage of malignant inflation. If the government did not have the determination to "cut off its arm to save the body" to reform, then not only would the rise in prices be endless, threatening the lives of the people, but also all industries and commerce would be plunged into a state of depletion and collapse due to the cyclical rise in prices, wages, and interest rates. After this reform, it will not only be conducive to the stability of finance, but also the lives of the people and all industries and commerce can be expected to be stable from now on. Second, because the issuance system of the legal tender was unsound, it had long lost the people's trust, causing the purchasing value of the legal tender for goods to be far below its actual value. Now that a new currency is being issued, not only is there ample reserve, but also a public issuance system is adopted, and the guaranteed reserve will also be received and kept in custody by the supervisory committee. It can be expected to restore the people's confidence in the new currency. Third, the fluctuating value of the legal tender in the past was a fatal blow to industry and commerce. Any production plan, any business plan, was impossible to talk about. Now that a new currency is issued and the value is stable, from now on it can promote production, prosper the market, and increase exports, so that our country's foreign trade and international balance of payments can also be expected to gradually become balanced.</p>
<p>The advantages and disadvantages of currency reform can be said to be known at a glance. Except for a few mad and selfish people in the country, no one does not support the new currency and hope for its success. However, in order to sincerely hope for success, we still have to frankly point out that there are two things that the government must make every effort to restrain: First, the government must respect the independence of the right of issuance, so that the issuance of the Central Bank's Gold Yuan notes is completely subject to the prior supervision of the supervisory committee, so that not a single Gold Yuan note is issued rashly without reserve. To do this, first ask the supervisory committee to check the total amount of legal tender and Northeast circulating coupons issued in the past, report it publicly, and absolutely stop the continued printing from now on. Then, the Gold Yuan notes used to redeem this old currency should be separated from the total amount and used for successive redemption, so as not to increase the total amount of currency in circulation due to the simultaneous use of the two. At the same time, without the signature of the person in charge of the supervisory committee, absolutely do not issue a single Gold Yuan note casually, in order to show great faith to the world. Second, the government must absolutely guarantee the property rights of good people who obey the laws, and strictly punish those who violate the law and seek personal gain without leniency. In the past, government laws and regulations were promulgated, but often went awry when implemented. Those who took the lead in abiding by them suffered. In the future, this must not be repeated. To be honest, there are always some people in society who take chances and profit from them. Now that they see the government reforming the currency system, stabilizing the economy, and stabilizing the people's livelihood, it is tantamount to announcing that their doomsday has arrived. They may not be dead yet, and they will take the opportunity to rise up, either making waves in the black market or raising prices in the market, attempting to defeat the emergency economic and financial measures implemented by the government. Even traitorous bandits and spies exist everywhere, or even harbor a schadenfreude mentality, fearing that the country's currency reform will succeed, and therefore do everything possible to instigate and disrupt the market for pleasure. Therefore, if we sincerely hope that the currency reform will succeed, then we must have the people and the government trust and cooperate with each other, challenge these scum, and finally overcome them.</p>
<p>In short, President Chiang has frankly stated that the government not only has the belief that the currency reform "will succeed," but also has great determination. As long as the government's executors work diligently and implement it effectively, as long as the people of the country can trust and cooperate with the government and work hard with one heart and one mind, then any difficult problems that will be faced in the future can be easily solved. However, everything must be carefully planned at the beginning. Looking at Shanghai's prices today, not only can we see the success or failure of the future of currency reform, but also whether the citizens of Shanghai have conscience and reason, whether they have the spirit of obeying and abiding by the law, and whether they have the ability to judge gains and losses, all can be seen.</p>

<h3>Special Criminal Cases: Litigation Procedure Adopts Review System</h3>
<p>Explanation from the Ministry of Judicial Administration</p>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Nanjing, 22nd] The differences between the special criminal litigation procedure and ordinary criminal cases in terms of system are attracting much attention. According to the explanation of the person in charge of the Ministry of Judicial Administration: Ordinary criminal cases follow the principle of three trials, with one trial as an exception, and the litigation procedure is in accordance with the provisions of the Criminal Procedure Law. Special criminal cases first apply the provisions of the Special Criminal Case Litigation Regulations, adopting a review system (equivalent to the second instance). For special criminal cases that fall under the crimes of the Emergency Punishment Regulations for Endangering the Nation during the Suppression of Rebellion Period, the litigation procedure first applies the provisions of the Special Criminal Court Trial Regulations, also adopting a review system.</p>
<h3>Zhejiang Province Decides to Thoroughly Reduce Rents, While Protecting the Legitimate Rights and Interests of Landlords, First Pacification Zone Implements Measures to Protect Tenants</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Hangzhou, 22nd] Chairman Chen's land reform is still in the planning stage. Before it is implemented, efforts will be concentrated on thoroughly implementing a 25% rent reduction. The provincial government has not made a specific statement on the Zhenhai County Farmers' Association's proposal to pay rent according to the Land Law because the official document has not arrived. However, it has made it clear that the provincial government is determined to reduce the burden on tenant farmers, but the legitimate rights and interests of landlords will be protected.</p>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Zhenjiang, 22nd] In order to protect tenant farmers and reduce their burden, the Administrative Office of the First Pacification Zone has specially telegraphed all counties to earnestly implement measures to protect tenants: (1) Tenant farmers' rent shall not exceed one-third of the annual main agricultural product (if the rent is agreed to be paid in currency, it shall not exceed one-third of the equivalent value of the annual main agricultural product). (2) Tenant rents owed during the turmoil period shall be waived. (3) Landlords who violate the above regulations should be severely punished without delay to serve as a warning to others.</p>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Jinan, 22nd] In order to implement the land policy, the Economic Department of the Pacification Zone here yesterday convened a meeting of relevant agencies such as the Land Administration Bureau, presided over by Director Liu Qixun, and resolved the following key issues: (1) Support owner-farmers and distribute land equally.

<h3>Naval Academy Freshmen Take Preliminary Examination, 480 Admitted, First Concentrated on Two Ships for Short-Term Training</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Nanjing, 22nd] According to the Naval Political Warfare Department: The recruitment examination for the 37th class of freshmen at the Naval Academy and the Mechanical School began in early July and has lasted for more than a month. A total of more than 6,000 people registered in nine examination districts across the country, breaking the record for the number of freshmen applicants in previous years. In order to maintain the excellent quality of the navy, the authorities have decided that the evaluation of the results should be fair and strict. The number of those who failed is quite large, so only 480 people passed the preliminary examination, accounting for 8% of the number of applicants. It is expected that the original quota of 200 students for the Naval Academy and 100 students for the Mechanical School will not change. The re-examination admission quota for the two schools adopts a provincial quota system, so that outstanding young people in each province have the opportunity to join the navy. This year, the admission quota for young people from the border areas, Mongolia, Miao ethnic groups, and overseas Chinese is even greater than in previous years. After the results of the re-examination are announced, this batch of freshmen can go to the two schools for registration at the end of August. Before enlisting, the freshmen will first be trained to develop maritime living habits. They are now concentrated on the "Zhongji" and "Zhongjian" ships in Xiaguan. During this short-term concentrated shipboard living training period, each freshman can gradually become accustomed to the basic actions of the public. Commander-in-Chief Gui of the Navy is very concerned about the living conditions of this batch of freshmen. He has repeatedly visited Xiaguan to give speeches, with many encouragements. The re-examination papers are being evaluated at an accelerated pace.</p>

<h3>Three-Nation Envoys Revisit the Kremlin, Negotiations Approaching Decision Stage, Four-Power Conference to Be Held in Paris If Agreement Reached on German Question</h3>
<p>[Reported] London, 22nd. Paris broadcast: A spokesman for the French Foreign Ministry stated on the evening of the 22nd that Stalin is likely to receive the envoys of the United Kingdom, the United States, and France soon, possibly on the 23rd or the evening of the 22nd.</p>
<p>[Reported] London, 22nd Broadcast: It is widely believed that the next meeting between the envoys of the United Kingdom, the United States, and France and Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov will be held at the Kremlin on the afternoon of the 23rd. Most observers believe that this meeting will be the last, and whether an agreement can be reached on the negotiations for a Four-Power Conference must be decided at this meeting. Sources in Moscow believe that if the Soviet Union can express agreement on the principles of the negotiations, the Four-Power Conference can be convened quickly, probably in Paris.</p>
<p>[Reported] London, 22nd Broadcast from Moscow: US Ambassador Smith, British Special Envoy Roberts, and French Ambassador Chataigneau met at Smith's residence for one hour and forty-five minutes on the 22nd, the longest meeting to date. The three-nation envoys are currently awaiting news of a visit with Molotov, and they believe that Molotov may receive the three-nation envoys on Sunday (the 22nd).</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 21st] According to sources close to the French Foreign Ministry today, the three-nation representatives stationed in Moscow will pay a visit to Stalin for the last round of preliminary talks between the three powers and the Soviet Union. It was also stated that the report received last night from French Ambassador Chataigneau is currently being studied by the Foreign Ministry. The talks in Moscow aim to reach agreement on the conditions for starting Four-Power negotiations on the German question. Therefore, the discussions only concern the Berlin situation caused by the Soviet blockade and the implementation of currency reform, and other issues such as reparations and the Ruhr are not involved. French officials finally firmly denied the rumors that the Western three powers have been slow to schedule the next meeting with Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov due to disagreements.</p>
<p>[United Press, Berlin, 22nd] The "National Daily," registered with the Soviet Union, reported from Moscow on the 22nd: "A unanimous solution has been reached in Moscow on the German question." The newspaper published the headline "Greater Berlin Currency Agreed Upon in Moscow" on its front page. The content did not mention the source of the news, but only stated, "It can be confirmed that the Western countries have recognized the East German currency as the sole currency system in Greater Berlin." The newspaper also stated that the three Western envoys will visit Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov on the 22nd and further stated, "It is believed that this is the last meeting of the current stage of talks between the Western representatives and Soviet officials." The "National Daily" stated that the German debt and the control of the Ruhr area "were not studied in detail during the discussion, but were only slightly discussed as a basis for the upcoming Four-Foreign Ministers' Conference." It should be noted that these two issues were the two main problems that led to the breakdown of the London Foreign Ministers' Conference last December.</p>
<h3>Most of the Personnel of the US and French Military Governments Have Withdrawn from Berlin, Cold War Remains, Troops Still Stationed</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Frankfurt, 21st, United Press] General Clay, Governor of the US Military Government, recently stated that after the breakdown of the four-power government in Berlin, most of the personnel of the US and French military governments have withdrawn from Berlin. However, because the Cold War between the Soviet Union and the Western countries remains, the Berlin garrison has not withdrawn. It is said that more than 75% of the personnel of the US Military Government have left Berlin, with only senior personnel and special advisors remaining. Many of the officers in the civil affairs agencies have been withdrawn to Nuremberg and Frankfurt, but the supervisors still remain in Berlin. It is said that in the past three weeks, about 3,000 French military government personnel and their families have withdrawn from Berlin.</p>
<h3>Border of the Three Occupation Zones of Berlin: British, American, and Soviet Military Police Confront Each Other</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Berlin, 21st, United Press] The United Kingdom and the United States have strengthened their guard forces. On the Potsdammer Platz, there are currently 150 military police facing 165 Soviet military and police personnel, and the atmosphere is gradually becoming tense. A total of 4,000 German civilians flocked to the Potsdammer Platz to watch. 60 British military police blocked the Potsdam road junction, and 75 American military police, supported by jeep patrols, were deployed on Strassmann Street nearby. They used jeeps as a front line, and bayonets were fixed to their rifles.</p>
<p>[United Press, Berlin, 22nd] British and American military police patrols continued to be stationed in downtown Berlin on the 22nd, while the Potsdammer Platz, the center of riots, shootings, stabbings, and kidnappings for two days, turned quiet again. The newly established signposts, wooden fences, and power grids on the border of the interlocking occupation zones of the United Kingdom, the United States, and the Soviet Union made the division of the occupation zones clear at a glance. American Public Security Chief Eisenhower stated that the military police patrols will remain there day and night "to protect our part." Black market merchants came to the Potsdammer Platz again in the morning of the 22nd and returned to their original positions, but they were hesitant in their transactions and lacked large customers. It should be noted that there used to be 4,000 people gathered there, but now only 500 Germans are coming and going to watch. The American Public Security Team and the Military Discipline Section have not received any news about the eight German police officers who were kidnapped by the Soviet army in the previous two days.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Moscow, 22nd] TASS released news this morning about the recent incident on the Potsdammer Platz in Berlin, stating that Soviet police were attacked by a group of thugs who had infiltrated the crowd. The agency was quite dissatisfied with the attitude of the British and American police, saying that the British and American police stood by and watched when the incident occurred and did not come forward to stop the rioters until the Soviet military police arrived and order was restored. TASS concluded that the riot was purely planned and that this plan can be explained by the fact that American and British photographers were already at the scene taking pictures when the incident occurred.</p>
<h3>East Zone Germans Request to Participate in West German Government</h3>
<p>[Reported] London, 22nd Broadcast: According to German sources, Western administrative authorities are discussing with right-wing leaders from the Soviet zone the matter of non-Communist members in the Soviet zone participating in the planned West German government. According to unofficial reports, one of the leaders in the Soviet zone is the former chairman of the right-wing Christian Democratic Party in the Soviet zone. Whether former Soviet zone politicians will have voting rights in the West German government is still in question. However, Germans generally believe that regardless of the outcome of the Moscow Four-Power talks, Germans in the East zone should have the right to participate in the West German government.</p>

<h3>The Soviet Union Repeatedly Promotes the Supply of Food to Berlin</h3>
<p>Only 20,000 Tons of Millet Delivered</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Berlin, 21st] The Information Bureau of the Soviet Zone has repeatedly issued public announcements, emphasizing that the Soviet Union will supply a large amount of grain and fats to all Berlin residents. Currently, ten transport ships carrying wheat have arrived here, and 5 million tons of sweet potatoes from the Czech Republic and 3 million tons from Poland have arrived here, and another 4 million tons can be added before November. In addition, Poland will supply 500 tons of oil and fats for the manufacture of artificial butter, as well as 5,000 tons of meat. Before December 31, the Soviet Zone will import 50,000 tons of fresh and canned fish. Although the Soviet authorities and various news agencies and newspapers have repeatedly emphasized the above-mentioned propaganda, only 20,000 tons of millet have actually arrived here so far.</p>
<h3>"Pan-European Parliament" Movement, Preparatory Committee to Convene in Brussels in November, France Invites UK, Belgium, Netherlands, and Luxembourg to Send Representatives</h3>
<p>[United Press, Paris, 22nd] A five-nation preparatory committee may hold a meeting in Brussels in November, at which time the first step towards creating a United States of Europe may be taken. In accordance with diplomatic convention, the French government has invited the United Kingdom, Belgium, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg to send parliamentary delegations to attend the meeting. If the four countries accept the invitation to attend, they will plan how to convene a pan-European conference. Although the nature of the Pan-European Parliament is only advisory, the dream of European unity from Charlemagne the Great to Churchill can be centered around the establishment of the committee. The British and French parliaments have been invited to send 25 representatives each to attend the preparatory meeting, Belgium and the Netherlands 11 each, and Luxembourg 3. The 75 representatives will make recommendations on the date and location of the first session of the Pan-European Parliament. Most importantly, they will decide which countries should be invited to participate. Given the complexity of the political environment, the five countries believe that initially only the current ten Marshall Plan countries, the three Western European occupation zones, and the Free Territory of Trieste should participate. Before European countries relinquish part of their sovereignty to a federal organization, the Pan-European Parliament will not have legislative or administrative power, but it will have the following functions: (1) Expressing the will of the European people for peace and unity; (2) Gradually considering practical methods for European political and economic unity; (3) Studying the constitutional, economic, and social problems necessary for the emergence of a European alliance; (4) Developing cultural ties so that Europeans can understand the basic principles of a common culture. More specifically, the parliament can also pass a charter of human rights, establish a European Supreme Court, and make recommendations to existing intergovernmental organizations. It should be noted that the Pan-European Assembly was proposed by the International Committee of the United Europe Movement at an unofficial conference convened in The Hague in May. At that time, the chairman was Churchill. Frenchmen Reynaud and Ramadier also attended and enthusiastically supported the movement, so the French government initiated the convening of the preparatory meeting.</p>
<h3>Hu Shih-tse Goes to France to Prepare for the Opening of the UN General Assembly</h3>

<h3>Wallace Launches Campaign, Denies Communist Presence in Third Party</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Connecticut, August 21] Third Party presidential candidate Henry Wallace launched his campaign here tonight, denying the presence of communists within the Third Party. He vehemently denied that the Third Party is controlled by those who believe in overthrowing the government by force. Wallace accused the House Un-American Activities Committee of having "killed" former Treasury Department official Harry Dexter White. White passed away a few days ago due to a heart condition exacerbated by the HUAC hearings. Wallace further accused the leaders of the AFL and CIO of betraying the working class and supporting the government's bipartisan foreign policy. Union leaders who support the Truman Doctrine are no different from the Un-American Activities Committee in leading America towards fascism.</p>
<h3>Reports of Soviet Troop Movements Westward Towards Black Sea, Possible Action Against Yugoslavia; Another Two Yugoslav Officers Flee to Hungary</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, London, August 22] The Sunday Times reported this morning, citing a correspondent in Istanbul, that Soviet troops continue to move towards the Black Sea. The correspondent suggests that this troop movement may be in preparation for military action against Tito's Yugoslavia.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Belgrade, August 21] The Yugoslav Communist Party's organ commented on the assassination of General Yovanovic and two other Yugoslav officials who attempted to flee to Romania, stating, "The unity of our party, the unity of our people's front, and the unity of our glorious army will not be shaken by this act of treason, but will be further strengthened."</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Budapest, August 21] It is reported that two Yugoslav officers have fled to Hungary, stating that "most" officers now oppose Marshal Tito. They were demoted and detained for opposing the anti-Soviet policies of the Yugoslav authorities.</p>
<h3>US Predicts New Soviet Protests over Teacher Case, Reports Suggest Soviet Consul General Lomakin Refuses to Leave US</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Washington, August 21] Officials awaiting Moscow's response to the recall of Consul General Lomakin stated on August 21st that the future of peace depends in part on whether the Kremlin receives accurate reports about America's firm policy towards the Soviet Union. Officials who have had contact with the Soviet Union have long suspected whether Soviet diplomatic representatives report the truth to Moscow, or tell them what they think Moscow wants to hear. The answer to this question is now crucial, as the Soviet Union may misunderstand America's position during a politically undecided presidential election campaign.</p>
<p>This issue was raised publicly when the State Department responded to the Soviet Union on August 20 regarding their lengthy protest over the case of the three defecting Soviet teachers, stating that it was based on "inaccurate reports from Lomakin." Lomakin was ordered to leave the country because of his grossly erroneous actions. Simultaneously, State Department officials predicted that Moscow would file a new protest regarding the case of the three teachers. It is generally believed that the Soviet Union will not let the strong action of demanding Lomakin's recall go unanswered. Some authoritative figures even believe that the Soviet Union will fabricate facts to attack American officials stationed in the Soviet Union in retaliation for Lomakin's expulsion. This would be the first such instance in the fifteen years since the two countries restored diplomatic relations. Generally, officials believe that the current tense international situation will not lead to war, unless the Soviet Union makes a serious error in its assessment of the American government's policy toward the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, New York, August 21] When asked if Lomakin would leave, Mr. Tschaikovsky replied, "I believe he will stay here as the Soviet Deputy Consul." This answer has sparked rumors that Lomakin will resist the orders of the U.S. government. However, according to the Swedish American Line, Mr. Tschaikovsky and his family have booked passage on a Stockholm-bound ship, which will depart on August 28. The company declined to reveal whether the booking was made before or after the Kasenkina affair.</p>
<h3>Mrs. Kasenkina's Condition Greatly Improved, Announces New York Roosevelt Hospital</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, New York, August 21] Mrs. Oksana Kasenkina, the Soviet teacher who fell from the window of the Soviet Consulate in New York, was removed from the critical list at Roosevelt Hospital on August 21. The hospital announced that Mrs. Kasenkina's condition had "greatly improved." At the same time, Mrs. Kasenkina's doctor, Dr. Panoye, wrote to Soviet Consul General Lomakin, reiterating that Mrs. Kasenkina "firmly requests not to be visited by Soviet consulate personnel." Dr. Panoye's letter stated that the hospital is not concerned with the political aspects of the case, but only with "the medical issues of curing Mrs. Kasenkina."</p>
<h3>US Air Force Conducts Firing Exercises in Mediterranean, Using Standard Weapons</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Tripoli, August 22] Eighteen US Air Force Thunderjet aircraft conducted special firing exercises in a secret area of the Mediterranean on August 22.

<p>[Central News Agency, Tokyo, August 22] US Special Representative to Korea, Muccio, with the rank of ambassador, will depart from here for Seoul tomorrow morning. Muccio arrived here from Washington a week ago en route to his new post in Korea.</p>
<h3>British Newspaper Criticizes Bevin's Diplomacy, Advocates Seeking Compromise with Soviet Union</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, London, August 21] The Daily Mirror, a British newspaper with a circulation of three million, concluded its three-day critique of British foreign policy on August 21, suggesting that Western powers should tell the Soviet Union, "Eastern Europe is yours." The newspaper advocated "new contacts" with the Soviet Union that could lead to peace, concluding, "We need peace, and we have a better chance of achieving peace with a strong and secure Soviet Union than with a weak and insecure one." The Daily Mirror believes that the first step towards peace should be to reach a political settlement with the Soviet Union, and suggests that Britain and the United States should tell the Soviet Union: "(1) Eastern Europe is yours. We hope for reasonable trade facilities there. We may comment critically on political developments there, but we guarantee that we will not use any military pressure on what may be called your security zone. (2) We propose an agreement so that the Soviet Union can have the Middle Eastern oil resources it needs. We consider the Middle East to be our security zone and intend to maintain it. But we accept the right of others to share the gasoline, and we are prepared to give a distribution and the prices of the oil to be paid, decided by an international organization. (2) As a guarantee that the Soviet Union will never have any worries afterwards, we insist on the exchange condition that the German economy be restored as soon as possible. And adopt a policy by which the great powers bring about the unification of Germany within ten years."</p>

Senior officials indicated that the government is taking these measures so that, under certain circumstances, the government authorities can take swift and effective steps. Observers believe that the announcement of these ordinances does not mean that the situation in Burma has worsened, but rather that they are preventive measures to deal with emergencies.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Rangoon, August 21] Indian radio broadcasts claimed that the Chinese government has dispatched a battalion of troops to the Burmese border to prevent Burmese insurgents from infiltrating Chinese territory.</p>
<h3>Israel Plans to Apply for Membership in United Nations, British Statement Indicates Lack of Support; After Warning, Fighting in Jerusalem Subsides</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Lake Success, August 21] Britain announced on August 21 that it will reject Israel's application to join the United Nations. British representative Cadogan stated that when Israel's application is submitted to the Security Council, he has not yet decided whether to use the veto power or abstain from voting, but he pointed out that Britain has not recognized the State of Israel and explicitly stated that Britain will not support a country it has not recognized.</p>
<p>Cadogan told reporters before departing for Paris to attend next month's United Nations General Assembly that Britain's final stance will depend on developments between now and the start of the conference. Israel's formal application has not yet been submitted, but a memorandum was circulated among members of the Security Council on August 20, requesting to join the United Nations, stating that if the United Nations does not accept it, it will threaten peace.</p>

A United Nations press officer in Haifa telegraphed here, saying: "Today is one of the quietest days in Jerusalem since the start of the second ceasefire. Only rifle and machine gun fire were heard; artillery fire has completely ceased."</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Amman, August 21] Amman announced that talks between Arabs and Jews in Jerusalem under the supervision of United Nations observers have been suspended due to unreasonable demands raised by the Jewish side.

<p>[Associated Press, Tel Aviv, August 22] Members of the Soviet delegation to Israel attended a performance of the opera "Thais" at the National Opera House on the evening of August 21. Because the theater only played the American anthem and not the Soviet national anthem, they angrily left.

<h3>Prelude to the American Election IV: Cannon Hero Wallace</h3>
<p>— Our Correspondent in the United States, Mao Shuqing</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from New York, August 13] In the 1948 American election arena, Henry Wallace can be considered the number one "hero"! Last month, Philadelphia held Wallace's "party founding conference," and their slogan was: "War or Wallace?" Wallace not only symbolizes the future "God of Peace," but also symbolizes that the world's various chaos since the end of World War II is entirely due to the lack of Wallace. On the seat of the Philadelphia Conference, Wallace proudly said: "If I had become the President of the United States after Mr. Roosevelt's death, there would be no so-called Berlin Crisis today!"</p>
<p>Why is that? Because the Soviet Union trusts Wallace. At the Third Party's opening ceremony, Black lawyer Howard Dodd once said: "The Soviet Union has always been seeking world peace. It is because the United States lacks ruling great politicians that US-Soviet relations have reached this point!" Wallace himself highly treasures the private letters that Stalin gave him. He said: If he can be elected President of the United States, he will definitely be able to discuss world peace with Stalin openly. Therefore, "all those who do not want war again, come and elect me!"</p>
<p>The Third Party's declaration stated: War between the Western powers and the Soviet Union is undoubtedly a victory for fascism and death. "Only peace is the only way for mankind to survive." It also said: "The cooperation between the US and the Soviet Union will greatly help world peace." How to cooperate? The declaration mentioned "canceling the Marshall Plan for European Aid and stopping aid to the corrupt governments of Greece and Turkey." In the United States, "immediately cancel the peacetime conscription bill," because the conscription bill has a suspicion of "preparing for war," and preparing for war is hostility towards the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>When Wallace and his colleagues were holding a meeting, it was the most tense time of the "Berlin Crisis." Many people asked Wallace, how should he deal with the Berlin Crisis? Wallace said very simply: "The United States withdraws from Berlin." In order not to offend the Soviet Union and to seek "world peace," Wallace believed that there was no need for American troops to remain in Berlin.</p>
<p>All American newspapers published Wallace's shocking claims. New York Herald Tribune reporter Thomas Stokes sent a telegram from Philadelphia saying: "That is a terrible group, a group of terrible communist conspirators, manipulating the venue, plus a group of ignorant youths who don't know the immensity of the sky and the earth, waving flags and shouting slogans there with a simple ideal." He said: "Wallace himself is not a communist, but what he says and does has lost reason and is completely manipulated by the communists." New York Daily News reporter O'Donnell wrote: "Wallace's conference is a terrible phantom, a conspiracy under the direction of the Kremlin, fooling the youth educated under the morbid American education system!"</p>
<p>Wallace himself firmly denied that he was being manipulated by the Communist Party. At a press conference at the Stratford Hotel in Philadelphia, a large group of American journalists pressed him about his relationship with the Communist Party. Wallace was initially unwilling to speak, but the reporters repeatedly forced him to answer, which caused this 1948 election hero to go from embarrassment to anger. He believed that the gossip reporters controlled by American capitalists were deliberately causing trouble for him. Some smart reporters explained from the side: "We don't mean to make things difficult for you, we just want to know a definite answer for news reporting!" After this explanation, Wallace felt a little more at peace. He said: "If anyone says that the Communist Party is manipulating our founding conference, that is completely absurd slander. Today, many people on the right say that I, Wallace, am a communist. The real communists say that I am a progressive capitalist. The reason why the Communist Party supports me is entirely because I advocate cooperation with the Soviet Union!"</p>
<p>Wallace's "running mate," the Third Party's vice-presidential candidate Taylor, said even more humorously that the Communist Party advocates armed revolution to overthrow the current government. "All those who sympathize with our Third Party this time are relatively less crimson, and are more like light red communist followers. You must know that true, deep crimson, genuine Communist Party members would rather support the Republican Party and would rather elect Dewey." Why is that? Because genuine Communist Party members "hope that there will be another Hoover and another economic panic."</p>
<p>Although the explanation was very humorous, suspicions between the Third Party and the Communist Party still arose endlessly inside and outside the conference. When the conference declaration was being read and seconded at the conference, a delegate named James Loeb, a member of the American Democratic Movement, said angrily: "The draft declaration is being manipulated by the Communist Party. We cannot so definitely agree with everything the Soviet Union does. We cannot say that everything the Soviet Union does is good!" Another delegate, Michael Torney, a veteran of the American labor movement and a member of Congress, argued that the declaration should not be too pro-Soviet and should not be too inclined towards the Communist Party. As soon as he finished speaking, he aroused the anger of some radical elements. Dr. Tugwell from Chicago, the chairman of the declaration drafting committee, was the first to oppose the amendment. He said: The Soviet Union is peace-loving, and the Third Party cannot lack the friendship of the Soviet Union. Dr. Jonesstown, dean of the medical school at Howard University, and Pressman, the person in charge of the New York Third Party campaign headquarters, who was later involved in the international spy case, all stood up to denounce the so-called "amendment." Tugwell also solemnly reminded the conference delegates: "Treasure the price of unity and recognize the danger of differing opinions."</p>
<p>Tugwell was full of Roosevelt. He said he understood President Roosevelt more deeply than anyone else. He said: "If Roosevelt were still alive today, he would definitely sympathize with the Third Party's platform and policies." He also said that one day Roosevelt was chatting with him, and Roosevelt said that the Democratic Party would inevitably split in the future. Because of historical factors, the Democratic Party could not implement many of his plans. President Roosevelt also predicted that a "Progressive Party" would appear in the future.</p>
<p>The Third Party was officially named the "Progressive Party," perhaps based on this reason. Originally, since Wallace announced the formation of a party and ran for election last December, most Americans knew that Wallace had a political party, but they didn't know what party it was? Wallace himself said: "I want to run for election as the president of progressive American citizens." Outsiders called him the "New Party" or the "Third Party." It was not until this Philadelphia founding conference that it was officially named the "Progressive Party."</p>
<p>In fact, the name Progressive Party is not Tugwell's new creation. In American history, this is the third time there has been a Progressive Party. As early as 1912, Theodore Roosevelt and Johnson organized the Progressive Party and ran for president. As a result, they won 27% of the national vote but were unsuccessful. In 1924, La Follette and Wheeler also organized the Progressive Party and won 16% of the vote, but they were also unsuccessful. The organization of the Progressive Party was a flash in the pan and soon disappeared. The New York Times said: The Progressive Party easily gains the support of residents of big cities, but is too far removed from the people of the whole country. The Times also said: The previous Progressive Party was relatively simple. Now that the Communist Party is sandwiched in the middle, it is of course more complicated. What will be the outcome of this year's Progressive Party in the future? That depends on how this big "hero" Wallace does it.</p>
<h3>If Diet is Not Dissolved, Two Parties Will Split; Japanese Cabinet Will Inevitably Resign; Socialist Party Chairman Katayama Warns Prime Minister Ashida</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tokyo, August 21] Japanese Social Democratic Party Chairman Tetsu Katayama warned Prime Minister Hitoshi Ashida yesterday that if the current government attempts to prevent the dissolution of the Diet in order to maintain power, the total resignation of the cabinet will ultimately be unavoidable. This is the second time that former Prime Minister Tetsu Katayama has publicly expressed the Social Democratic Party's determination to dissolve the current Diet. Prime Minister Ashida recently issued a statement saying that he had not found any reason to dissolve the current Diet and that the government would use all its power to avoid this. Katayama's warning was issued in response to Prime Minister Ashida's statement.</p>
<p>Kanjuro Kato, the Labor Minister of the Ashida Cabinet affiliated with the left wing of the Social Democratic Party, supported Tetsu Katayama and told the Japanese press yesterday that he and other left-wing members of the Social Democratic Party agreed with the proposal to dissolve the Diet as soon as possible. Tetsu Katayama, who is currently on a speaking tour in Hokkaido, told Japanese reporters yesterday morning, commenting on Ashida's recent statement, that Ashida's efforts to avoid dissolving the Diet would be ineffective and would only deepen the rift between the Democratic Party and the Social Democratic Party. Tetsu Katayama pointed out that the differences of opinion between the two parties have become more apparent due to long-standing debates over issues such as the recent revision of wage standards and the Civil Service Law. Dissolving the current Diet is the only way to avoid the breakup of the two parties; otherwise, the conflicting policies of the two parties will eventually lead to the total resignation of the current cabinet.</p>
<p>[Shinya News Agency, Tokyo, August 22] Prime Minister Ashida said in Takaoka City on August 21: "The dissolution of the Diet will be avoided as much as possible before the end of this year. One of the reasons is to fully materialize the contents of the MacArthur documents, and the second is to complete the posture of accepting foreign investment. I personally believe that the work of the Central League will be successful, and as a result, the Democratic Party will become the first party, but for this reason, the Democratic Party itself must be drastically reformed, but not a reform that provokes scandals."</p>
<h3>Chinese Residents in Northern Malayan States Register</h3>

<h3>Gold Standard Notes to Be Issued Today; Preparatory Supervisory Committee Established; Deputy Finance Minister Reports Details of Allocating Reserves</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] The Gold Standard Note Issuance Preparatory Supervisory Committee was formally established yesterday at 4:00 PM in the Central Bank conference room, and held its first meeting. Attendees included Chairman Li Ming, committee members Li Xun, Pang Songzhou, Cai Pingfan, Liu Gongyun, Xu Jiqing, Wang Xiaolai, and Qin Runqing, as well as Deputy Minister Xu Boyuan and Governor Yu Hongjun, representing the Ministry of Finance and the Central Bank, respectively, who delivered speeches. They elaborated in detail on the government's determination to reform the currency system, the adequacy of preparations, the transparency of the issuance system, and the establishment of currency credit. They also expressed the government's earnest expectations for the establishment of the Supervisory Committee. During the meeting, Deputy Minister Xu Boyuan presented details of the allocated reserves, which included cash reserves comprising gold, silver, and foreign exchange totaling US$200 million. The discounted prices for gold and silver were both below market prices. Gold was valued at US$35 per ounce, while the actual market price was US$50. Silver was valued at US$0.70 per ounce, while the actual market price was US$0.75. The storage of foreign exchange was supported by verifiable documentation. Guarantee reserves of US$300 million consisted of marketable securities and assets of state-owned enterprises, with detailed lists. The committee has dispatched personnel to negotiate the takeover and safekeeping of these assets, to reinforce the reserves and maintain confidence in the currency.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper] The first day of Gold Standard Note issuance begins today, along with the exchange of Legal Tender. In addition to the Central Bank and its branches handling the exchange, the Central Bank has also entrusted the Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, the Farmers Bank of China, the Central Trust, the Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau, the Central Cooperative Treasury, and the provincial banks of each province and their branches to handle the exchange. The Municipal Bank of this city is also included in the list of entrusted agents.</p>
<h3>Bank Exchanges of Negotiable Instruments Converted to Gold Standard Currency</h3>
<p>(Our Newspaper) The Shanghai Clearing House resumes operations today (the 23rd) and, starting today, all bank exchanges of negotiable instruments will be based on the Gold Standard Currency. There are four points to this effect: (1) Starting August 23, 1948, all negotiable instruments presented for exchange by banks will be based on the Gold Standard Currency. (2) Legal Tender notes should be handled in accordance with Article 4 of the "Points for Attention Regarding Currency Reform within Banks" formulated by the Banking, Money, and Trust Associations. (3) The Clearing House has already printed exchange forms with corner and cent units. If banks' original forms do not have corner and cent units, please come to the Clearing House to exchange them. If the original forms have spaces for corners and cents but do not explicitly state the words "corner" and "cent," please fill them in yourselves. (4) For payment slips and transfer application forms originally used by banks with the words "National Currency" printed on them, banks should add a stamp with the words "Gold Standard" and continue to use them as usual.</p>
<p>The Clearing House was closed yesterday for a regular holiday, but it continued to operate as usual, rushing to convert the account books of all member banks to the Gold Standard Currency and accepting applications from clearing banks numbered 50 and beyond to the Central Bank, so that banks could receive Gold Standard Notes to meet today's market needs.</p>
<h3>Short-Term Treasury Bills Decided to Be Temporarily Suspended</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] It has been learned that after the issuance of Gold Standard Notes, the issuance of short-term treasury bills will be temporarily suspended.</p>
<p>Furthermore, starting today, state-owned banks and bureaus will abolish all remittance commissions, only charging handling fees, and stipulating that the handling fee shall not exceed one Gold Standard Note.</p>
<h3>State-Owned Banks Allow Banks to Borrow Funds Temporarily for Turnover</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] Banks and money shops in this city were ordered to close temporarily for two days on August 20 and 21. August 22 was a regular Sunday holiday, and today marks their official reopening. At the same time, the government is beginning to issue Gold Standard Notes nationwide today, implementing the new currency system. The Central Bank, in view of the frequent payment transactions between banks and their customers at the beginning of the currency system's implementation, and the potential difficulties in cash flow for a small number of banks, has decided to temporarily allow banks to borrow Gold Standard Notes from state-owned banks by discounting the government-issued 1947 US Dollar Bonds, short-term treasury bills, and listed securities, in order to meet temporary needs. However, the aforementioned designated government marketable securities must be owned by the banks themselves. As for listed stocks, they must be loan collaterals received by the banks and must have records available for verification. It is reported that when the State-Owned Banks' Business Bureau handles these temporary loans, the Gold Control Bureau will dispatch auditors to conduct strict audits to prevent irregularities.</p>
<h3>Declarations by Two Business Groups Support Emergency Financial and Economic Measures; Everyone Should Have the Determination That "Hoarding Currency is Better Than Hoarding Goods"</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Industrial Association and the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce jointly issued a declaration yesterday in support of the emergency financial and economic measures. The original text is as follows:</p>
<p>It has been three years since the victory. Due to the increased issuance of currency and the daily depreciation of its value, commodity prices have soared, causing great suffering to the people. The practical lessons are obvious to everyone today, without the need for further explanation. On the 19th of this month, the government resolutely issued an emergency financial and economic decree, ordering currency reform. Considering the crisis, there can be no further delay. Considering the conditions, there are many difficulties ahead. After careful calculation, it issued this decisive measure, which is naturally a good medicine for the situation. The whole country supports it, with everyone sharing the same sentiment. However, support is just lip service, while trust is a real need. Everyone must trust that the government is determined to reform the currency system, that the issuance is limited, and that the reserves are supervised. The main root cause of past price fluctuations has been removed. Therefore, the government's order that the prices of various goods and services in all regions should be converted to Gold Standard Currency based on the prices on August 19, 1948, and sold accordingly, should be observed and followed by the industrial and commercial circles of Shanghai. From now on, everyone should have the determination that "hoarding currency is better than hoarding goods," wash away the psychological tremors and doubts of the past decade, and then commodity prices can be permanently stabilized, without turning back and rising again, so that commodity prices and the currency system will not be in a never ending competition. To make everyone have the idea that "hoarding currency is better than hoarding goods," the government must provide better protection for those who can save, so that they will not be sacrificed under the currency system again. At a time when military affairs are not yet settled and national expenses are enormous, we would rather endure hardship, strictly adhere to the limits, and never issue an extra note, so as not to undermine the credibility that is about to be established. Then this currency reform can become the first major achievement after the victory. It must be known that, compared from any aspect, this currency reform is far less superior in conditions than the Legal Tender policy of 1935, and far less favorable in environment than the victory at the beginning of 1945. Today's currency reform is like an isolated army trapped in an encirclement, which can only win and not fail. Only when the people and the government work together, and the government and the people are of one mind, can we say that we are out of the encirclement. Today's matter is just the beginning of a preliminary experiment. Confidence must be had, but we must not be optimistic or pessimistic. It must be known that optimists will fail, and pessimists will fail even more. Only when the city's industry and commerce realize that this is related to the survival of the people, that the opportunity cannot come again, that they abandon their selfish and opportunistic mentality, and wholeheartedly support this national policy, can the currency reform be successful. Finally, the associations place their greatest expectations on the members of the Issuance Preparatory Supervisory Committee, who will restore the currency system's credibility that has been undermined for ten years, which is equivalent to reviving the economic life of 450 million people. The responsibility is placed on your shoulders. Thinking of this, we are both happy and fearful. "Drawing water from the well is too far away," and "Wei Que's fears are not new." Respectfully urge the gentlemen to display their martial virtues, and the people will be fortunate. This is just a declaration.</p>
<h3>Jewelers Association Resolves on Prices for Gold and Silver Jewelry</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] The Shanghai Jewelers Association held a joint meeting of directors and supervisors at 10:00 AM yesterday, chaired by Chairman Wu Pengnian. They discussed the resumption of operations today (the 23rd) and the re-establishment of prices for gold and silver jewelry. The meeting resolved: (1) Starting today (the 23rd), all jewelers will resume operations, but the principle of exchanging gold will still be at 80% of the weight. (2) The exchange rate for gold jewelry will be 200 Gold Standard Notes per ounce, and the repurchase price will be 190 Gold Standard Notes per ounce. An additional handling fee will be charged for exchanging gold jewelry, with rent or consignment at 10 Gold Standard Notes per item, negotiable on a case-by-case basis. (3) The exchange rate for silver jewelry will be 3 Gold Standard Notes per ounce, and the repurchase price will be 2.4 Gold Standard Notes per ounce. (4) Used gold jewelry will be discounted by 7 Gold Standard Notes per ounce. (5) Handling fees for silver jewelry will be negotiated on a case-by-case basis.</p>
<h3>Currency Reform Halts Printing of Customs Gold Units, Printing Workers Fear Unemployment</h3>
<p>Since the currency reform, the printing of Customs Gold Units has been ordered to stop. The printing workers at Datong and Zhonghua Book Company have switched to printing books. However, about 6,000 workers at the Central and Daye printing factories have had no work to do since the printing of banknotes was stopped. Fearing that the authorities may dismiss them, they are extremely anxious and have been holding emergency meetings in recent days to discuss countermeasures. It is reported that the authorities have approved the continued printing of subsidiary coins or dismissal, which is currently under consideration and will be formally decided today.</p>
<h3>Economic Management Committee to Hold First Supervisory Meeting Today</h3>

<h3>Shanghai and Tianjin Stock Exchanges Unlikely to Reopen Soon</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 22nd] After the Shanghai and Tianjin Stock Exchanges were ordered to suspend operations, Wang Zhixin, the person in charge of the Shanghai Stock Exchange, went to Nanjing to meet with Wang Yunwu and Chen Qitian, requesting an early resumption. However, according to relevant sources, this is unlikely. At least until November 21, when the old Legal Tender completely ceases to circulate, the Shanghai and Tianjin Stock Exchanges are unlikely to resume operations.</p>
<h3>Stock Exchange Continues to Suspend Operations; Settlement Methods Resolved Yesterday; Wang Zhixin to Go to Nanjing Again to Request Reopening</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] The Shanghai Stock Exchange held its 42nd standing council meeting at 5:00 PM yesterday, chaired by Director Du Yong.

<p>(3) Both parties involved in the settlement of stock prices will add deferred interest for three days, calculated at a monthly rate of 2.1%. For settlement prices of Type A and Type B treasury bonds, deferred interest of 7 jiao Legal Tender will be added per day, totaling 2.1 yuan Legal Tender for three days, which will be converted to Gold Standard Notes and settled together.</p>
<p>[Additional News] General Manager Wang Zhixin of the Stock Exchange plans to go to Nanjing again this Thursday to request instructions from the Executive Yuan, the Ministry of Finance, and the Ministry of Industry and Commerce regarding the reopening of the Stock Exchange.</p>
<h3>Designated Banks Hope to Supply Foreign Exchange Funds</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] According to a person in charge of a designated bank: After the currency reform, the new currency Gold Standard Note is rigidly set at a rate of 4 to 1 against the US dollar, and the price of foreign exchange will not fluctuate in the future. The designated banks still hope that the Central Bank will supply foreign exchange funds to facilitate the settlement of foreign exchange for importers. After the implementation of the new currency measures, it is expected that foreign exchange brokers will be hit hard due to the stability of foreign exchange market prices.</p>
<h3>Liu Weizhi Discusses Overseas Remittances</h3>
<p>Believes the Government Should Offer More Incentives</p>
<p>Mr. Liu Weizhi, Chairman of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission, made a statement in response to a reporter's question about the impact of currency reform on overseas remittances. He believes that the stability of the new currency will eliminate the need to evade overseas remittances, and that revenue from overseas remittances can be increased. However, whether the future can be permanently optimistic depends on the stability of the overall situation. Mr. Liu said: Overseas remittances can be divided into the following two categories according to their nature: (1) Family support expenses. Since overseas remittances no longer need to go through the black market, these remittances can return to government control. (2) Investment. This amount accounted for a large proportion before the war. If the government can maintain currency credit for a long time and the overall situation gradually stabilizes, the number of overseas remittances returning to the country for investment will inevitably increase. Mr. Liu pointed out that overseas remittances reached 300 million yuan per year before the war, accounting for about 40% of the fiscal budget at that time. Although most countries other than the United States restrict remittances from overseas Chinese, there is still hope that revenue from overseas remittances will reach 100 million US dollars per year in the future. Mr. Liu concluded: Even if the situation is favorable to overseas remittances, the government should still offer more incentives. In my personal opinion, the restrictions on the methods of importing overseas Chinese capital announced by the Import and Export Control Commission need to be further relaxed.</p>
<h3>Strictly Limit Prices to August 19; Economic Police Monitor All Industries and Markets</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] The police's economic police brigade has been ordered to closely monitor all industries and markets starting today. If it is found that brokers are trading at prices exceeding those of August 19, they will be arrested and severely punished according to the law. The black market trading of gold and banknotes is still strictly prohibited. Once discovered, they will be sent to the Special Criminal Court for severe punishment.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Commodity Survey Institute will convert the Legal Tender market prices of various commodities in this city on "August 19" into Gold Standard Notes and print them into a special table. In addition to submitting them to relevant agencies for reference, all sectors can contact the institute directly if they need them (the address is 519 Fuzhou Road, 1st floor).</p>
<h3>Four Joint Branch Resolved Yesterday on Domestic Remittance Fees</h3>
<p>Since the promulgation of the Financial and Economic Emergency Decree, the work of the Shanghai Four Joint Branch and the State Bank Bureau has been extremely tense. On the 20th, 21st, and 22nd, the internal affairs were still operating as usual, actively preparing for the new measures after the opening on Monday. In order to make the Shanghai State Bank Bureau's business cooperate with government orders, the Four Joint Branches also held a temporary meeting in the afternoon of the 22nd to conduct a detailed review of how the deposit and remittance business should cooperate with government orders thereafter. As for domestic remittances, it has also been decided that the flat remittance fee will be 5 jiao per thousand yuan for this province, and 1 yuan per ten yuan for other provinces. The minimum handling fee for each remittance is 1 jiao. For remote areas where the Central Bank does not provide head-office allocation, the handling fee may be appropriately increased, which will be implemented from today. Postage will not be charged, and telegram fees will be handled in accordance with the general regulations of the Four Joint Branch.</p>
<h3>Gasoline Restores Old Prices; Costs are Very High</h3>
<p>The prices of gasoline, diesel, and other fuels have been restored to the August 19 prices by the oil companies in compliance with government orders. It is reported that the so-called August 19 prices were actually approved by the Import and Export Control Commission on August 5, based on a rate of 6.33 million Legal Tender per US dollar and a workers' cost of living index of 1.86 million times for the first half of the month. By August 15, the US dollar had risen to 8.36 million Legal Tender, and the workers' cost of living index had also risen to 3.63 million times for the second half of the month. The oil companies applied to adjust prices, and the Import and Export Control Commission approved them on the 19th. Now, in order to comply with the new decree and restore the old prices, but the new currency system sets each US dollar at 4 Gold Standard Notes, and each Gold Standard Note at 3 million Legal Tender. According to this conversion, each US dollar is actually equivalent to 12 million Legal Tender, which is more than double the 6.33 million yuan used before the pricing on August 5. In this situation, the oil companies' selling prices will naturally not cover the costs. The source of oil becomes worrisome. The foreign exchange expenditure for oil is too high. Users must also strive to save on the use of oil to reduce the burden on our country.</p>
<h3>Confucius Society Advocates Confucius Birthday Scholarship Movement</h3>
<p>The Confucius Society has set the Confucius Birthday Festival (Teachers' Day) on the 27th of this month to participate in the Confucius ritual at the West Gate Temple.

<h3>Yasuji Okamura to Be Publicly Tried Today; Leaders from Nanjing and Shanghai Will Attend</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] Yasuji Okamura, the number one Japanese war criminal, will be publicly tried at the Shanghai Municipal Council on Tanggu Road starting at 9:30 AM today.

<h3>Bankers Association Resolves to Lower Deposit and Loan Interest Rates; No Conclusion on Capital Increase; Decides to Ask for Assistance from the State Bank</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] The Shanghai Bankers Association convened a temporary meeting of directors and supervisors at 10:00 AM yesterday to discuss interest rates on deposits and loans between banks, as well as capital increase issues. Representatives from the money industry and trust industry associations were also present. The meeting was personally presided over by Chairman Li Ming. Regarding interest rates, it was decided that, starting from the 20th of this month, the interbank overnight deposit interest rate would be reduced from the original 2.4 yuan per thousand Legal Tender to 1 Gold Standard Note (equivalent to 3% monthly interest). The interbank overnight loan interest rate would be reduced from the original 15 yuan per thousand Legal Tender to 5 Gold Standard Notes (equivalent to 1.5% monthly interest). The interbank overnight discount and public treasury certificate discount interest rate would be reduced from the original 13 yuan per thousand Legal Tender to 3 Gold Standard Notes (equivalent to 0.9% monthly interest).</p>
<p>The issue of capital increase was discussed in detail, but no conclusion was reached due to the complexity of the issue. The meeting believed that the various expenses of the current financial business cannot be reduced for a while, and the deposit capital strength will inevitably be reduced after the currency conversion, making the capital increase even more difficult, and there is no definite certainty about the future of the business. This time, they reluctantly sacrificed, lowered the interest rate, and reduced it by two-thirds, which had a considerable impact on the business. In the future, it will be necessary for the State Bank to quickly promote rediscount and mortgage policies to support the financial industry. Finally, it was resolved that the banking, money, and trust industry associations would jointly submit a request to Governor Yu of the State Bank, stating the above opinions, hoping to provide instructions and guidance on how to supply the market with the legitimate operating funds of the industry in the future, and how to moderate the deposit and loan interest rates.</p>
<p>[Additional News] Li Ming, chairman of the National Bankers Association Federation and the Shanghai Bankers Association, Qin Runqing, chairman of the National Money Industry Association Federation, Xi Rixin, chairman of the Shanghai Money Industry Association, and Yan Chengde, acting chairman of the Shanghai Trust Industry Association, jointly telegraphed the President yesterday, expressing their unanimous support for the Financial and Economic Emergency Decree.</p>
<h3>City Industrial Association Established Yesterday; Over Fifty Important Cases Passed; Leaders Urge Industrial and Commercial Cooperation and Labor-Management Coordination</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The inaugural meeting of the City Industrial Association was held at 9:00 a.m. yesterday in the auditorium of the Pudong Native Place Association. Two hundred and thirty-three representatives from various industrial trade associations attended. Government officials present included Gu Zhenggang, Minister of Social Affairs; Gu Baochang, Director of the Department representing Minister Chen of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce; Lu Jingshi, Vice Minister of the Central Ministry of Agriculture and Industry; Wu Guozhen, Mayor of Shanghai; and Wu Kaixian, Director of the Shanghai Social Affairs Bureau. Guests included Pan Gongzhan, Speaker of the Shanghai Municipal Council; Xu Jiyin, Chairman of the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce; Shui Xiangyun, Chairman of the Shanghai General Labor Union, and over twenty others. The opening ceremony began promptly at 9:00 a.m. Du Yuesheng was elected chairman by the presidium to lead the proceedings. Mr. Du delivered the opening remarks, stating briefly: "Today marks the completion of the preparatory work for the Shanghai City Industrial Association and the convening of its inaugural meeting, which is also a grand gathering of unity for the industrial sector of this city. We are greatly honored to have senior officials from the central government, local administrative leaders, and guests from all walks of life present to observe the ceremony. Rewarding production is clearly stipulated in the Constitution, and increasing production to build the nation has been established by the government as a national policy. The responsibilities of the industrial sector cannot be underestimated. This city is the center of gravity for industry in the entire country, the place from which modern equipment is introduced, and the basis for regulating international trade. The industrial sector here is interconnected and shares a common destiny with the industrial sectors throughout the country. During the Anti-Japanese War, the sector suffered significant losses due to relocation, dispersal, and destruction. However, since the restoration, it has made vigorous efforts to recover. Responding to the international environment and mindful of national survival, we in the industrial sector must unite and work in harmony to contribute to the country. Now that the Industrial Association has been established, a collective unity is being established to seek welfare and correct abuses. The steps and strength are all endowed by laws and regulations, and we should all work together to encourage each other. We also hope that government officials and leaders from all sectors will provide guidance to serve as a compass." Afterwards, Pan Shihao, Secretary-General of the Congress, reported on the preparatory process, detailing the convening of the sponsors' meeting on June 1st this year at the Lido Garden, the drafting of the association's charter, and the solicitation of members. After Secretary-General Pan's report, he invited the government officials and guests to deliver speeches.</p>
<p>Work Together to Achieve Soundness</p>
<p>Minister Gu delivered an instruction, stating briefly: "The completion of the organization of the Shanghai City Industrial Association and its official establishment today are sufficient to indicate the great potential for the future development of Chinese industry. Shanghai is the industrial center of the country, and the establishment of the Industrial Association here can serve as a leader for industrial associations nationwide. I have three points: (1) To enable industrial development, we should overcome all external and internal difficulties. To overcome external difficulties, we should first improve the technical and management issues within the industrial sector itself. We must all work together in unity, deeply believing that this is strength, so that the organization of the Industrial Association becomes more sound. (2) Industrial and commercial cooperation and labor-management coordination. Under today's national social labor policy, we must strive to promote labor-management coordination and work closely with the industrial and commercial sectors. The development of the industrial sector itself also promotes the development of the commercial sector. (3) After the government implements new economic measures, it will not only safeguard the country but also the entire industry. Therefore, we hope that the industrial sector will play a role in coordination and leadership."</p>
<p>Assisting the Government in Overcoming Difficulties</p>
<p>Mayor Wu stated briefly: "Today, the establishment of the Shanghai City Industrial Association is directly related to the construction and prosperity of Shanghai, and indirectly affects the construction and prosperity of the entire country. The greatest strength of our country is in Shanghai, and the greatest strength of Shanghai is in industry. The industrial sector can make the currency reform plan successful, help the government, and also help itself solve various problems. If we do this, we will succeed. Today, with the establishment of your association, the people of the city and even the people of the whole country are sincerely praying for success. We hope that you will exert your strength to assist the government in overcoming the current difficulties and successfully completing the economic reform."</p>
<p>Director Wu stated briefly: "After the victory, I, standing in the position of the competent authority, fully understand the difficult situation of the industrial sector. In the past, because the industrial sector lacked a unified organization, it could not plan and solve difficulties in a comprehensive way. Most of the time, they fought on their own without a leading organization to solve problems comprehensively. After the establishment of the Industrial Association, it will definitely be of great help to the future of the industrial sector. The establishment of the Industrial Association is taking place after the currency reform. The stability of the new currency system will be of great help to the industrial sector. We hope that everyone will work together to cooperate with the government's policies to realize them. Finally, I hope that the Industrial Association and the General Labor Union will have more contact, coordinate labor-management relations, and implement the Kuomintang's labor-management policy."</p>
<p>To Share Weal and Woe with the Government</p>
<p>Speaker Pan delivered a speech: "With the establishment of your association today, the industrial sector has a bright hope. The reason is that the government is promulgating orders for currency reform and economic innovation. In the past, the industrial sector was oppressed by high prices, high wages, and high interest rates, making it impossible to breathe. Now that we have these four reform measures, as long as the people of society support them and sincerely help the government implement them, these measures will definitely succeed. The establishment of your association today is the first organization and force to support these measures. We believe that the more than 9,000 factories belonging to the industrial sector will definitely support these measures. The government must trust the people, must trust the good people, and those engaged in industrial production are all good. Only those who escape funds abroad and whose chimneys do not smoke are not good. Our good industrial production must share weal and woe with the government, and we will definitely be able to overcome difficulties and strive for a bright future for the industrial sector."</p>
<p>Subsequently, Xu Jiyin, Chairman of the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, and Shui Xiangyun, Chairman of the General Labor Union, delivered speeches one after another, expressing their willingness to cooperate with the Industrial Association to promote it and stabilize the lives of workers and promote labor-management coordination. Finally, Chairman Shu Yunyi delivered a thank-you speech.</p>
<p>Pass a Telegram to the President to Pay Respects</p>
<p>The meeting then discussed the charter and budget proposal, and appointed members of various review committees. At 12:30 p.m., the chairman announced a recess. All representatives had lunch at the venue, and the review committees used their spare time after lunch to review the proposals. The assembly resumed at 2:00 p.m. to elect directors and supervisors. At around 5:00 p.m., the discussion of the proposals began. More than 50 proposals were passed, the most important of which were: (1) Asking the government to make good use of US aid materials and encourage factories to engage in extensive cooperation with the industrial technologies of advanced countries. (2) Asking the government to quickly allocate the first batch of Japanese reparations machinery and equipment and have each factory determine the types and quantities of the second batch of machines to negotiate with the Allied Headquarters, dismantle, transport, and install them to protect rights and increase production. (3) Asking the government to seriously consider opening trade relations with Japan to safeguard national industry. (4) The business tax on manufacturing should be uniformly reduced by half in accordance with the law. (5) Establishing a joint venture company for export industrial products to develop foreign trade. (6) Opening foreign exchange, strictly implementing protectionist trade, and prohibiting the import of luxury goods and manufactured products that are already produced in the country. (7) Regarding the fuel coal and diesel required by steel smelting factories, the government should supply them in sufficient quantities to facilitate production. (8) Asking the government to restore the same-day cashing of checks to facilitate capital turnover. (9) Opening industrial loans to maintain the survival of factories. Finally, a telegram was passed to President Chiang to pay respects.</p>

<p>Wu Kaixian, Director of the Social Affairs Bureau, was summoned to Nanjing the day before yesterday and returned to Shanghai yesterday morning. At 12:00 p.m. yesterday, Wu, together with Zhao Banfu, Deputy Director of the Social Affairs Bureau, Shen Ding, Director of the Labor Department, and Shui Xiangyun, Chairman of the General Labor Union, hosted a banquet for Minister Gu of the Ministry of Social Affairs at the New Asia Hotel and discussed the issue of wage calculation.

<h3>Minister Gu Returns to Nanjing Today</h3>
<p>Hoping Factories to Focus on Inspection Work</p>
<p>Minister of Social Affairs Gu Zhenggang arrived in Shanghai from Nanjing yesterday morning to attend the inaugural meeting of the City Industrial Association. According to Gu's interview with the Central News Agency reporter, the issue of wage calculation for employees of private enterprises in this city should be in accordance with the 13th, 14th, 22nd, and 23rd articles of the Regulations for Reorganizing Finance and Strengthening Control of the Economy, and the Social Affairs Bureau should formulate methods with reference to the actual situation. He also participated in yesterday's meeting convened by Director Wu of the Social Affairs Bureau with the responsible parties of the City General Labor Union to discuss this issue. Gu also answered a reporter's question regarding the handling of the unfortunate incident at the Yongbei Underwear Factory. He believes that in the future, factory inspection work will be actively promoted to promote factory safety, and he hopes that each factory should have a deep understanding of factory inspection work. Taking the Yongbei Underwear Factory as an example, factory inspection can not only promote labor-management coordination, but also ensure the safety of life and property between labor and management. Regarding the refugee relief incident and the immigrant reclamation issue, the Ministry of Social Affairs is now planning to handle it in Jiangxi and Suiyuan provinces. This plan has been contacted several times with the two provinces of Jiangxi and Suiyuan, and the principles have been determined. What remains to be determined is the technical issue, which is currently being actively carried out and will be completed soon. After attending the wage issue talk meeting with Director Wu yesterday noon, Gu went to the Pudong Workers' Welfare Committee to inspect and participate in the welcome meeting of the committee. In the evening, he attended a dinner hosted by Du Yuesheng, Chairman of the Shanghai City Industrial Association. This morning, after attending the Children's First Aid Fund meeting, he took the night train back to Nanjing.</p>
<h3>Comfort Items for Soldiers in the Central Plains Will Be Transported to the Front Lines for Distribution</h3>
<p>In view of the great victory in eastern Henan, the National Comfort Association for Suppression of Rebellion Soldiers organized a Central Plains Comfort Group, with Zhang Fang and Xie Renzhao serving as the leaders and deputy leaders respectively, to comfort the troops in Xuzhou, Kaifeng, Zhengzhou, Shangqiu, and other places. In response, the Shanghai City Comfort and Fundraising Committee, in addition to allocating 20 billion yuan in comfort money, also launched a campaign among the guilds and factories in Shanghai to donate comfort items. As of August 20, the committee received 4,116 woolen blankets, 2,699 toothbrushes, 3,348 packages of toothpaste, 876 tubes of toothpaste, 238 cartons of cigarettes, 101 pairs of running shoes, 1,172 bottles of medicine, and 329 other items. It is reported that the comfort items have been paid to the group and will soon be transported to the front lines for the soldiers to use. In addition, famous opera singers (from 1:00 p.m. to 3:00 p.m.) and famous actors and actresses (from 4:00 p.m. to 2:00 a.m. the next morning) will broadcast famous songs and raise 10,000 gold yuan in aid to education to rescue young people who are out of school. It has also been decided to host a reception for the opera performers at the New World Jingu Hotel at 3:00 p.m. on the 25th to discuss the selection of activities, and to host a reception for the news media that evening at 7:00 p.m. It is hoped that all sectors will enthusiastically donate to promote the spirit of respecting Confucius and teachers and do their best in the movement to promote education.</p>
<h3>Passenger and Freight Transportation Prices for Land, Sea, and Air to Be Calculated in Gold Yuan Notes Starting Today</h3>
<p>Under the Currency Reform Order, the prices of ship, airplane, and train transportation will be calculated in gold yuan notes starting today. Before the new fare is approved by the Ministry of Communications, the Beijing-Shanghai Railway Bureau will temporarily calculate it at the original price. The bureau issued a notice yesterday ordering all station passenger and freight ticket offices and business offices to collect passenger and freight transportation revenue from August 23 in legal tender as required, and all will be converted into gold yuan notes. Fractions below one cent will be rounded to the nearest five cents.</p>
<h3>New Prices for Shipping Passenger and Freight Transportation Will Be Higher Than Pre-War Standards</h3>
<p>In order to cooperate with the central government's currency reform, the shipping industry will set new standards for passenger fares and freight prices. According to Xu Xueyu, General Manager of China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, the calculation method for new passenger and freight prices was determined yesterday, and Li Yunliang, Yuan Hushi, and three others have been appointed as representatives to go to Nanjing today (the 22nd) to ask the Ministry of Communications for instructions. This time the new price will be higher than the pre-war standard, because the pre-war price of lump coal was 11 yuan per ton, while the current price is more than 50 gold yuan notes. The pre-war price of diesel was 36 yuan per ton, while the current price is more than 1 million yuan. The pre-war price of hardware was 17 cents, while the current price is more than 1 yuan. However, in order to avoid stimulating prices, it will be slightly increased.</p>
<h3>Economic Promotion by the Public Works Bureau; Water Supply Project in West Shanghai</h3>
<p>In order to solve the water shortage in West Shanghai, the Municipal Public Works Bureau implemented an emergency project last year, completed deep wells and reservoir pumping stations, and successively opened new users to more than 200 households. This year, it will implement a plan to connect the inland tap water plant, adding a pumping station at Xietu Road, laying 400 meters of trench pipes in Wanping Road and other places, and equipping electromechanical equipment and other equipment. Among the projects that have been completed, there are the Xietu Road pumping station building, the Huiji Road water pipe bridge, the giant high-pressure pumping machine, and various water pipe accessories. The 18-inch diameter water pipe laying project on Wanping Road has also been 90% completed, and it will be connected to Hengshan Road within days. The French side's existing 24-inch special pipe leads directly to the large reservoir in West Zhongzheng Road. The motor and machine installation project of the Xietu Road pumping station is only waiting for the pipeline, accessories, and power equipment to be rushed. In addition, water meter station projects, if the funds are allocated, can also be completed in one month. It is reported that after the completion of the entire project, more than 7,000 tons of water can be supplied every day, which is equivalent to the water consumption of more than 100,000 people. By then, the water supply situation in West Shanghai will be more ideally resolved.</p>

<h3>Zhu Zhengwen Hosts All Sectors to Report and Expose the Truth about Deng Zhonghe; Analyzes Four Points and Awaits Judicial Resolution</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The case of Deng Zhonghe being accused of being a traitor is currently being investigated by the High Prosecutor's Office. In addition to filing a private prosecution with the District Court against Deng for libel, claiming that Deng referred to him as an "extortion bandit," the original accuser, Zhu Zhengwen, hosted all sectors at the Xianlesi Dance Palace yesterday afternoon to report the accusations. To clarify his identity and the circumstances of his underground work during the war, Zhu placed the awards and Victory Medals awarded by the former National Government in front of him, which attracted attention. According to Zhu's report: (1) His accusation against Deng Zhonghe for being a traitor is based on facts and all the evidence he has collected, and it is definitely not groundless or for other purposes. Now Deng suddenly falsely accuses him of being an extortion bandit, which is incomprehensible. If he is a bandit, why not accuse him to the authorities, but only after being accused himself does he publicly falsely accuse him of being a bandit? This is obviously a vengeful slander and should be held criminally responsible. (2) During the war, he and Qiang Lei remained in Shanghai to engage in anti-traitor work and sent a letter warning Deng Zhonghe to stop financing the enemy. Deng was willing to provide a small amount of money to assist the anti-Japanese troops. Standing on the anti-Japanese position, this is a patriotic act. Standing on the enemy's puppet position, one can arbitrarily add insulting terms to others. Deng's so-called first extortion refers to this. (3) The reason why he accuses Deng of being a traitor, in addition to the Wanlilang letter in the past, there is other strong evidence that is inconvenient to announce. Deng used military blankets, cotton yarn, and other important materials to finance the enemy, and also contacted the enemy military general's Deng's own Anle Factory site to provide it as a dormitory for employees of the Toyota Textile Co., Ltd. In addition, due to Deng's special relationship with the enemy military, Deng's factory was not subject to power supply restrictions. (4) He and Le Runtin went to the Englishman Glenn last winter to request the clarification of debts. At that time, Wanya was seized by Deng, and he and Deng mutually accused each other at the police station. There are records to check. If there was extortion, wouldn't the police take care of it? Deng's claim that he was extorted the second time was a deliberate slanderous injury in an attempt to vent his anger. He concluded by saying: Now that everything has been brought to justice, we should wait for a judicial resolution.</p>
<h3>Young Girl Aspirations for Journalism; Unable to Fulfill Her Wishes, She Commits Suicide by Poison</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Zhang Liyun, an 18-year-old local girl, at 16 Huanghe Road, Dongfuli, had been studying at a women's vocational school. She graduated this summer. Her father, Minggao, in order to enable his daughter to further her studies, intended to ask her to apply for the National Tongji University. However, Liyun aspired to journalism and asked a friend named Luo to introduce her to Shanghai New College. Soon, her parents found out and strongly opposed it, preventing her from enrolling and placing her under house arrest. However, Ms. Zhang's will was very strong, and despite several dissuasions, she never followed. At around 3:00 p.m. the day before yesterday, she had another argument with her mother over this issue and was slapped twice by her mother. Later, she was dissuaded by relatives and friends from going downstairs. Before long, the girl, feeling resentful at being beaten and humiliated, secretly swallowed poisonous potion and committed suicide. The incident was discovered afterwards and she was rushed to the hospital for treatment.</p>
<h3>Young Woman Attempts Suicide Due to Family Dispute</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] At around 6:50 p.m. yesterday, Zhang Wang, a 20-year-old young woman, No. 9, Lane 578, Nanchang Road, had a family dispute and suddenly had suicidal thoughts. She took poison and attempted suicide alone in the room. She was later discovered by her family and rushed to Qing Hospital for treatment.</p>
<h3>Special Relief Donation; Shipping Industry Donates 100 Billion</h3>
<p>According to the Shanghai Shipping Association, the member companies of the association, in view of the special relief donation, have decided to donate 100 billion yuan. In addition to the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company bearing 40 billion yuan, the remaining 60 billion yuan will be calculated according to the net tonnage of the ships of each member company and will be paid off before the end of August. The donation will be collected by the China General Chamber of Commerce, and each member company has been notified to handle it.</p>
<h3>Qingyuan Art Society Annual Meeting; Election of Directors and Supervisors</h3>
<p>The Qingyuan Art Society held its annual meeting on the 17th, electing Zhen Qicai, Pan Gongzhan, Ling Wanqing, Wang Yangzhen, Bao Juxiang, Pan Yaoju, Tang Jifu, Shen Maishi, Zhang Rui, Bao Xiaodie, Gao Nianci, Xu Yanqiu, Pang Zuoyu, Li Huiqiu, Yang Qingqing, and 15 others as directors, and Sun Luqing, Shen Tianxin, Wu Dongmai, Tang Guanyu, Wu Zhongxiong, Shen Jinbo, Lu Peizhi, and seven others as supervisors.

<h3>New Cotton to Be on the Market Soon; Spinning Mills Prepare to Purchase</h3>
<p>The new cotton of this year will be on the market soon, and cotton farmers in various places are preparing to harvest. Previously, many spinning mills in this city were partially suspended due to the lack of raw cotton, and they have now sent personnel to prepare for the purchase work. The state-owned China Textile Construction Corporation is scheduled to convene the second business meeting of the heads of each unit at 3:00 p.m. today to discuss the plan for purchasing new cotton, because there are many conveniences for purchasing domestic cotton under the current situation: (1) With the abolition of the Cotton Management Committee, domestic cotton can be freely purchased, which is much more convenient than when it was controlled. (2) After the issuance of the new currency, the gold yuan note, it is more convenient to carry than the old legal tender.</p>
<h3>All-Day Heavy Rain; Temperature Drops Suddenly</h3>
<p>In this city, after 6:35 a.m. yesterday, heavy rain poured down. From morning to dusk, the total rainfall in 11 hours was nearly 1.025 inches, and the temperature dropped suddenly, with the highest being only 80.6 degrees and the lowest being 76.3 degrees. It presented a cool autumn atmosphere. According to the Shanghai Meteorological Observatory, due to the heat flow in the southwestern part of the Siberian anticyclone, it came into contact with the eastern, central, and northern parts of our country. In the afternoon, the cold and hot air currents condensed, causing heavy rain in this city all day. Due to the stagnation of the cold and hot air currents, it is difficult to predict when the weather in this city will improve.</p>

<h3>The Disaster Area North of the Yellow River: An Endless Expanse of Water, 40,000 People Suffering and Enduring Calamities</h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent Ling Songshou</p>
<p>[Special Report from Xiuwu, 18th of this Month via Airmail] For ten years, the people of northern Henan have been suffocating in an atmosphere of gunpowder, yet they must endure further natural disasters. Not to mention distant events, recent calamities include the great droughts of 1942 and 1943, followed by locust plagues, last year’s floods, and a windstorm in March of this year that destroyed hundreds of thousands of acres of wheat fields in the three counties of Yuanwu, Yangwu, and Yanjin. Before the damage from the windstorm could be fully accounted for, the Qin River and the Huai River overflowed in July, causing an unprecedented flood.</p>
<p>According to the Xinxiang Fourth Administrative District Commissioner's Office, the affected area covers 1,151,546 acres, spanning the nine counties of Xinxiang, Xiuwu, Huojia, Wuzhi, Hui, Ji, Hong, Jun, and Hua. It has destroyed 42,419 houses, caused 489 deaths and injuries, and left 400,260 people in dire need of relief.</p>
<p>On July 31, representatives from Xiuwu and Wuzhi counties waded through water to Xinxiang to appeal to various sectors for help. The representative from Wuzhi County told reporters that in addition to the Qin River flooding, Wuzhi County also suffered from floods caused by the Yellow River's backflow, submerging 200,000 acres of farmland and causing more than 3,000 deaths. Over 60,000 people are in need of aid.</p>
<p>The Flood Flows North</p>
<p>The cause of this flood can be traced back to last year's flood. In July of last year, approximately 50,000 to 60,000 troops under the communist Chen Geng attempted to seize Jiaozuo, successively capturing the four counties of Qinyang, Bo’ai, Xiuwu, and Meng. In August, our Xinxiang and Jiaozuo garrison troops launched a pincer attack, recovering Xiuwu and reopening the transportation between Jiaozuo and Xinxiang. The communists, unwilling to give up, breached the Qin River levee near Dafan Village in Wuzhi County, mimicking the historical breach of the Yellow River to cut off Jiaozuo's connection to the outside world.</p>
<p>The Qin River flows from Shanxi into Henan, passing through Qinyang and Jiyuan counties, bypassing Wuzhi County, and flowing into the Yellow River. With the levee breached, the raging flood flowed north into the Dan River, causing widespread disaster. Although the Qin River flood caused damage last year, the disaster was relatively minor because the rainfall in northern Henan was not heavy at the time, and most of the autumn harvest had already been collected. From last year to this year, some people considered ways to seal the breach, but the breach was under communist control. Without considering the size of the project, sealing the breach would require at least two regiments to be stationed there, otherwise, no one could guarantee that the communists would not breach it a second time.</p>
<p>On July 18, 19, and 20, northern Henan experienced days of continuous heavy rain, causing the Qin River's water level to rise sharply. Mountain torrents from the Taihang Mountains rushed down. The Dan River, the upper reach of the Wei River, was originally just a narrow channel. How could it accommodate so much additional water? As a result, it burst its banks on both the north and south sides, submerging fields, harming people and livestock, and sweeping away houses and furniture, spiraling out of control.</p>
<p>Regarding the Yellow River flooding, Commissioner Zhang Jingzhong of the Fourth District told reporters that during the Anti-Japanese War, when he was fighting guerrillas in northern Henan, the communists were still allies. They breached the northern levee of the Qin River in an attempt to drown the troops under his command stationed in western Wuzhi. Zhang ordered three gaps to be dug in the Yellow River levee to divert the water south. Wanling Village, where the Yellow River now backflows, is one of the three original gaps.</p>
<p>When the reporter arrived in Xinxiang, Yan Mengli, the director of the Xinxiang-Jiaozuo Transportation Section, pointed to the platform at the station and told me that the water level at its highest point was almost level with the platform.</p>
<p>The floodwaters have receded slightly, and Xinxiang is not the most severely affected area, so there is no obvious sign of flooding in the Xinxiang urban area. The reporter traveled to the outskirts of Beiguan, where the flow of the Dan River was turbulent, which locals said was a rare occurrence.</p>
<p>Due to transportation and geographical factors, this flood in northern Henan may not be receiving enough attention. The reporter decided to visit the affected area. Considering transportation and security issues, the reporter decided to focus on Xiuwu, the most severely affected area.</p>
<p>Railroad Ties Made into Rafts</p>
<p>On the 3rd, I accompanied Fan Chengfang, the Chief Secretary of Xiuwu County who came to Xinxiang to appeal for help, to Xiuwu. The distance from Xinxiang to Xiuwu is 100 Chinese miles. We took the New-Jiaozuo section's repair work train to the 31st-kilometer marker – Shiziying, leaving 38 Chinese miles to walk.</p>
<p>Leaving Xinxiang Station and crossing the Pinghan Railway, there was still some standing water on both sides of the railway. What used to be a loess plain is now dotted with ponds and clear water. After passing through Huojia County, the county town was surrounded by water. Continuing west for three or four Chinese miles, the railway became a narrow and long peninsula extending into the large body of water on either side.</p>
<p>Arriving at Shiziying, we began walking the rest of the way, walking along the railway embankment. After not even two Chinese miles, we came to a breach that local residents had dug to divert the northward-flowing water. The breach was not large, so I took off my trousers and socks, changed into cloth-soled shoes provided by the orderly, and waded across. The water reached my mid-thigh.</p>
<p>Scattered rails lay on the embankment, and watermarks could still be seen on the stones of the road surface. The embankment was five or six feet higher than the fields, so we could imagine how deep the water was at its highest level.</p>
<p>There were countless breaches in the embankment, and water flowed endlessly from south to north. We waded through the smaller breaches. Some of the larger breaches were bridged with two rails, and we walked across them tremulously with a sense of "walking on thin ice", turning our bodies sideways and not daring to look down. In some places where the water was too strong, enterprising disaster victims had built wooden rafts about ten feet square. Four strong men lifted the four corners, and people stood on them, walking in the water which could reach their mouths. One raft was made of ten railroad ties, with a blackboard placed on top. Anyone with sensibility would say: "This is education and construction amidst the confluence of natural and man-made disasters!"</p>
<p>The Officials Don't Light Lamps</p>
<p>In a place where it is usually difficult to see water, now there is an endless expanse of water. Half of the houses were submerged. Although the sorghum stalks were tall, they would not bear fruit after being soaked in water. A farmer was examining his crops in the water by the side of the road. I asked him across the water, "Is it still good, fellow villager?" "It's no good!" From his voice, I could understand his feelings. Looking north, the water seemed to extend all the way to the foot of the Taihang Mountains, which breathed out white clouds, sighing beside us.</p>
<p>At every small village along the way, there were vendors selling tea and watermelon. Many children (you could call them disaster children) were naked, snatching the watermelon rinds we had eaten. They would fight over a piece of rind. The road was full of unspeakable, shocking scenes. The setting sun accompanied us as we ran to Xiuwu.</p>
<p>The next day, there was a fierce wind and heavy rain, so I could not work. In the evening, Chief Secretary Fan and I chatted with County Magistrate Xu Wentao, who had just returned from supervising the battle at Daiwang Town, in the county government. The county government did not have money to light lamps, and the room was pitch black. Outside the window, the wind and rain were bleak, and the ancient locust tree in the courtyard rustled in the strong wind.</p>
<p>County Magistrate Xu told the reporter about a grain requisition account: For military grain, a total of 5,000 large packages, totaling one million catties, were to be requisitioned from July to September this year. For provincial public grain, 6,500 shi, totaling 973,000 catties, were to be requisitioned for the entire year. For the Special Commissioner's Office public grain, 5,000 shi, totaling 750,000 catties, were needed from June this year to January next year. The county government's own expenses and the local militia's food and salaries required 3,000 shi per month, totaling 450,000 catties. But how much grain could Xiuwu County produce? The entire county has only 1,000 qing of arable land. Assuming each acre produces three dou of grain, the total annual grain production is only 30,000 shi, which is only enough for Xiuwu County's own expenses. There is a folk song among Xiuwu farmers: "Three months in spring, three months in autumn, three months of vegetables, three months of forbearance." This means that the spring harvest can sustain them for three months, the autumn harvest can also sustain them for three months, they have to dig wild vegetables outside for three months, and they only have to endure hunger for the remaining three months. In normal times, Xiuwu's food supply is not self-sufficient. Last year, the Qin River flooded, and this year's wheat harvest was poor. If County Magistrate Xu had not led the self-defense militia to seize the unharvested grain, Xiuwu County would have had a very difficult time getting through the spring famine this year. As of now, Xiuwu still owes more than three million catties of military grain and public grain to the authorities, so Chief Secretary Fan once told me: "The people of Xiuwu do not hope that the authorities will provide disaster relief. They would be satisfied if they could be exempted from paying these many arrears of grain." During the following days that the reporter stayed in Xiuwu, he confirmed the extent of the county government's poverty. The county magistrate frowned with anxiety over the 10 million yuan in funding required by the Xiu-Huo-Bo-Wu Four-County Command. The militia company commander cried to the county magistrate because the soldiers had no food to eat. These were facts more serious than the flood.</p>
<p>On the 5th, the reporter, Inspector Wang of the Special Commissioner's Office, and Chief Secretary Fan took a small boat to the western disaster area of Xiuwu. We were traveling on a river more than ten zhang wide. When we asked people, they told us that this was originally a highway from Xiuwu to Bo'ai. A pole dipped into the water was six or seven feet deep. As our boat went past, countless willow branches brushed our faces. Unfortunately, willows have become a source of sorrow here. Otherwise, it would truly be "green brushing the faces of passersby."</p>
<p>The boat navigated the highway, navigated the fields, and reached Yangchang, a relatively large village.</p>
<p>Black Noodle and Melon Rind</p>
<p>As soon as we entered the village, the people knew that we had come to investigate the disaster, so they all knelt before us, tears streaming down their faces. An elderly man said to me, "Last year's flood prevented us from harvesting the autumn wheat, and this year's wheat was also bad. We just hoped that the autumn harvest would be available so that we could live a good life, but now the autumn harvest has been flooded again. What should we do?" As he spoke, tears streamed down his face, one by one.</p>
<p>I asked an old woman, "What do you eat?" She told me that they waded to other villages to get some black noodles and cooked them into soup. She added with tears in her eyes, "My eldest grandson ate melon rind outside and got sick. He is still sleeping at home." Before she could finish, a middle-aged woman next to her interjected, "My little girl drowned a few days ago when she went outside to pick wild vegetables." Before she could finish, she burst into sobs.</p>
<p>Amidst a chorus of sobs, several disaster victims said to us, "We have nothing to eat, but the troops still want grain from us. If we don't give it, they beat us. We just hope that the Qin River mouth can be blocked so that the water will recede and we can farm. We will give them any grain, but now we have nothing. How can we give it?" After we comforted them for a while and promised to negotiate on their behalf, they allowed us to take a tour of the village.</p>
<p>There were several tiled houses in the village, and the courtyards were still a foot deep in water. Watermarks remained six or seven feet high on the walls. Most of the mud houses had collapsed. The housewives were sorting out the scattered furniture. Several donkeys or oxen were pitifully thin, staring blankly at us.</p>
<p>When we left Yangchang, the disaster victims repeatedly urged us, "Commissioners, please say more to the central government!" Their voices, along with the sorghum stalks in the water blown by the wind, trembled in unison.</p>
<p>After returning to the city, the leading figures of Xiuwu were discussing how to get through the spring famine next year. Because the Qin River mouth is not blocked, it seems that the water will not recede. If the planting season is missed, there will be nothing to eat next spring. However, a certain agency in Xinxiang still holds a negative attitude towards blocking the mouth, believing that blocking the mouth and receding water will affect the defense of northern Henan. But how will the four million disaster victims trapped in the water in northern Henan survive?</p>
<p>The Arsonist from Jiangyin, Miao Gengsheng, and Others, Escorted for Interrogation</p>
<p>[Report from Jiangyin, 21st of this Month] Miao Gengsheng, the deputy chief of the Third Bao in Ligang, west of the county, colluded with bandit Miao Shunbao and others to set fire to the home of fellow villager Miao Qing on the 28th of last month. The Shengang District escorted the arsonists Miao Gengsheng and others to the county for interrogation. County Magistrate Xu personally went to Ligang to investigate and confirmed the facts, deciding to deal with them severely. Now, Wang Nanlin and 38 other representatives of the people of Ligang Town have jointly submitted a petition to the county government and the local court, accusing Xu Zhenqing, a senator from Ligang, of exploiting the people and setting fire to Miao Qing's wheat house, requesting that he be punished by law.</p>
<p>The Township Head of Suzhou, Sun Xuchu, Accused of Extorting Settlement Allowances</p>
<p>[Report from Suzhou, 20th of this Month] Sun Xuchu, the township head of Xiangshan Township in the Wu West District under the county, forcibly apportioned settlement allowances among the baos based on the amount of land cultivated during the first conscription period of this year, ranging from five dou to two shi. Most of it was embezzled by Sun, arousing public outrage among more than 500 households of farmers from Jiangyin in the township. They appointed Miao Xikun, Wu A’chu, Li Helin, and others to jointly accuse Sun Xuchu of obstructing military service to the Wu County Regiment Management District. On the 20th, after the Regiment Management District Military Law Office summoned Sun Xuchu, he was ordered to be detained pending investigation due to the seriousness of the crime.</p>

<h3>Social Aspects of Shenyang</h3>
<p>— Zhao Zhan, Our Correspondent</p>
<p>[Report from Shenyang via Airmail, 19th of this Month] The only transportation to and from Shenyang is by air, which contributes to a near economic suffocation that increases Shenyang’s instability. The social problems and conflicts increase daily, as do the number of criminals. One can easily see the famine by observing the long lines at a dozen or so soup kitchens, where poor people line up for hours for a single meal, and seeing beggars starving to death on the most luxurious Taiyuan Street. One need only open the newspaper to a full page of criminal news to find the answer: aberrant behavior is born from hunger, a life-or-death state of desperation that results in sadness, resentment, a desire to commit crime, a passive and declining lifestyle, and suicide. These are the foundations of criminal behavior.</p>
<p>Thefts and Rape Cases Happen One after Another</p>
<p>The most common case is robbery. The popularity of theft is the most serious problem in Shenyang today. The main culprit in the sensational 1.3 billion yuan robbery was an active military police officer, who has been executed. There are a variety of robbery tactics, and many robbers impersonate military officials to rob. Many small thieves are killed at night. Large and small thefts are increasing daily. The public security bureau feels there isn’t enough space in the overcrowded jails to hold the prisoners. The burden of food for the prisoners is also a problem.</p>
<p>As prices soar, rape cases also increase. Here is an example: A 12-year-old girl was raped by a 32-year-old scoundrel. The girl, Wang Yuru, had a mother whose aunt was living with an army captain named Lu Gan. They broke up and Lu Gan came to the house seeking intimacy with his former lover but was rejected. Lu Gan saw the girl was young and pretty and lust overcame him. He forced himself on the girl, who was injured and passed out. Before this event, a bao instructor in Yuhong district raped a 14-year-old girl while pretending to check household registrations. Before that, Wang Fu raped Wang Jialin, a student at the Fourth Middle School, and was executed.</p>
<p>Death is a Blessing, Dying Young Saves One from Suffering, Dry in the Sun Saves on Coffin Costs</p>
<p>Suicide is no longer a stimulating news item in Shenyang. Although there are no detailed statistics, the number of suicides has increased recently. Some entire families commit suicide by poison. Some jump into the Hun River. Still others hang themselves in scenic Beiling Park. In Shenyang, you can see corpses rotting on the streets as you walk around. Most die of starvation. People move the body around to avoid the stench of the rotting corpse. Local officials do not collect the corpses, so no one cares. Passersby only cover their noses and walk past. A reporter passed the corpse of a dead beggar outside the Yingzhou Restaurant in the Beishi district. He was standing next to a living beggar who lamented, “Death is a blessing, dying young saves one from suffering, and drying in the sun saves on coffin costs.”</p>
<p>Students are Prostitutes on the Streets</p>
<p>Anyone who has been to Shenyang knows that the romantic Chunri Town (now Taiyuan Street) was, at the beginning of the recovery, a place where Japanese women sold trash and showed off their allure. Now, the scene is the same, but the faces are different. We are seeing our fellow sisters take the place of Japanese women who have already returned to a steadily growing Japan. Hunger is driving unemployed women to sell their bodies. When the lights come on at night, they appear on the streets like ghosts. It is estimated that there are over 10,000 women in this “profession.” They are most active on Taiyuan Street, where bars and cafes are concentrated, similar to the Ginza district of Tokyo. The Shenyang nightlife is concentrated on this short road. Some hotels have become flesh markets, with prices not as high as the pork market. It is said that some of the prostitutes are female students. These miserable goddesses understand very well that their souls will not rise to heaven, but will rot with their bodies.</p>
<h3>The Military Instructor, Ma Lishi, Commits Suicide by Poison in Wuxi</h3>
<p>[Report from Wuxi, 21st of this Month] A guest, Ma Lishi, in room 206 of the China Hotel on Tongyun Road, suddenly committed suicide by poison at around 10:00 AM this morning. The cause of his death is quite bizarre. The guest was a major instructor at the Eleventh Medical College of the Joint Logistics Department of the Ministry of National Defense, aged 31. After arriving at the hotel on the 19th of this month, he summoned a prostitute for a chat. This morning, the tea server discovered that Ma had taken poison when he entered the room. Although he immediately reported to the cashier and called for a doctor, it was too late. The body has now been transported to the Hotel Association, and the local prosecutor's office was notified this afternoon to send personnel for an autopsy. It was determined that he died of poisoning, but the type of poison he took has not been determined. The reason for his suicide is unknown.</p>
<h3>Ge Wangshi, A Farmer in Kunshan, Gives Birth to Four Children at Seven Months</h3>

<h3>Guanwai Travelogue (7): The Yanching Oil Mine - Welfare Undertakings Investigation</h3>
<p>— Our Reporter Song Lin</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Lanzhou Dispatch, 18th by Air] The oil industry itself has only two types of projects, namely oil extraction and refining. Consequently, it only has two departments: the well site and the refinery. At the Ganqing Oil Mine in Laojunmiao, Yumen, Gansu, the well site section, including its affiliated engineering office, "Drilling Department, Drilling Teams 1 and 2, Extraction Department, and Repair Department, has only slightly more than 500 employees. The refinery section, including the Refining Department, Mechanical and Electrical Department, Engineering Management Office, Oil Products Depot, Wax Factory, Administrative Affairs Section, and Laboratory, has only slightly more than 700 employees. Therefore, those directly engaged in production number only slightly more than 1,200 people. However, the total number of employees at the Ganqing Oil Mine is actually slightly more than 5,300. Among these more than 4,000 people, apart from a very small proportion of management personnel, the majority are engaged in employee welfare undertakings to ensure the smooth progress of oil production projects.</p>
<p>Isolated from the World, Welfare Foremost</p>
<p>The persons in charge of the Ganqing Oil Mine attach the same importance to employee welfare undertakings as they do to engineering affairs. This is because on this boundless Gobi Desert at the foot of the Qilian Mountains, although the oil river flows northward incessantly throughout the year, its banks do not even have a single clump of low shrubs. Even if you had countless gold, you could not buy a pound of sesame cake. This is a place isolated from the world. The daily necessities of the mine's nine thousand employees and their families all depend on external sources. Take grain, for example: it must be purchased and transported from more than 300 kilometers away. Even the daily vegetables must be obtained from Jiuquan, which is more than 100 kilometers away. These supplies cannot be short even for a single day. Therefore, the promotion of welfare undertakings has become a necessary and urgent measure for the mine.</p>
<p>The Ganqing Oil Mine has been engaged in welfare undertakings for ten years. They are constantly seeking ways to improve, but due to various constraints, they have not yet achieved their ideal state. However, they are currently able to provide a complete supply of essential food and clothing for employees and their families.</p>
<p>When the reporter visited the mine, he spoke with Wu Songlin, the head of the General Affairs Section, and Wang Changgeng, the head of the Welfare Section, about this arduous and difficult work. Director Wu said, "Our ideal for employee welfare is not only to improve their livelihoods, protect their interests, meet their needs, and reduce their living burden, but also to enrich their spiritual lives, increase their work interest, and provide them with opportunities for extracurricular study and leisure activities to promote their physical and mental well-being. In addition, we also seek to ensure employee safety, alleviate their life threats, provide protection against illness and disaster, and offer relief." "Yes, this work is too important!" Director Wang added, "Whether it is done well or not not only directly affects the lives of nearly ten thousand employees and their families, but also has a great impact on the development of the mine's operations."</p>
<p>The source of daily supplies for these many people relies on the offices of the Welfare Section stationed in Zhangye, Wuwei, Jiuquan, and Yumen, which need to purchase and transport them at any time. The main items are food, meat, dried vegetables, fresh vegetables, eggs, and seasonings. As for clothing, socks, toothpaste, towels, and other daily necessities, they are purchased and transported by the section's Lanzhou office or entrusted to various business offices and the Shanghai head office. According to current needs, 45,000 shi of food, 1,000 tons of daily necessities, and 2,000 tons of vegetables must be purchased each year. Most of these items are transported by vehicles from the Lanzhou business office.</p>
<p>Lowering Prices, Implementing Rationing</p>
<p>More than two-thirds of the mine's employees are from the Northwest. The staple food of the people in the Northwest is flour. Therefore, after purchasing wheat, the mine has a water mill with six grinding stones in Jiayuguan and a machine flour mill in Laojunmiao to grind its own flour. Each month, it can grind a total of 300,000 jin of flour, which is enough for the needs of all the people in the mine. Currently, each employee is rationed 5 shi sheng of rice, 21 to 44 jin of flour per month (smaller portions for small households), as well as 2 jin of vegetable oil, 1 jin of salt, and about 4 jin of soy sauce and vinegar. The prices of these items are not only very cheap, but also kept as low as possible for the workers. The price list for July (unit: yuan) is as follows:</p>
<p>Table of Quantities of Daily Necessities Rationed to Employees and Families This Year</p>
<p>In Lanzhou, one dou of rice currently sells for 7.7 million yuan, and one jin of flour sells for 3.3 million yuan. Therefore, the employees of the mine live very stable lives and are mostly dedicated to their duties and willing to take on responsibilities. Compared to the labor disputes that often occur in factories in other large cities, this is truly another world.</p>
<p>More than a dozen other daily welfare items, such as clothing and footwear, are allocated in fixed quantities and supplied at a uniform price. As for cigarettes, sweets, and other daily consumables, they can be purchased at will at Jiuquan market prices without restrictions.</p>
<p>The July selling prices of these items were 500,000 yuan per chi of woolen cloth, 80,000 yuan per bar of soap, 100,000 yuan per toothbrush, and 90,000 yuan per chi of blue city cloth.</p>
<p>Various Institutions Arise in Response</p>
<p>On the reporter's tour, there were many production, health, and other institutions affiliated with the supply cooperative, all established to meet the needs of employee life. They are recorded separately as follows:</p>
<p>(A) Production Institutions:</p>
<p>(1) Sewing Department: Produces an average of 1,000 sets of Chinese and Western-style clothing and 2,000 pieces of various miscellaneous items per month. (2) Shoemaking Department: Produces an average of 100 pairs of leather shoes and 500 pairs of cloth shoes per month. (3) Sauce-Making Department: Produces soy sauce, fermented soybean paste, chili sauce, pickles, etc., as needed. (4) Brewing Department: Produces vinegar for seasoning, also brewed as needed. (5) Pastry Department: Bakes various pastries, averaging 300 jin per month. (6) Tofu Department: Produces tofu and dried tofu to supplement the lack of vegetables, averaging 200,000 squares per month.</p>
<p>(B) Health Facilities:</p>
<p>(1) Bathhouse: Equipped with 24 showers, used in shifts, with an attached delousing room for steam delousing. (2) Barber Shop: Three shops, 20 craftsmen. (3) Laundry Department: 50 workers, providing laundry services at very low prices. (4) Chinese Medicine Department: Sells Chinese medicine and prepared medicines.</p>
<p>(D) Other Facilities:</p>
<p>(1) Cafeteria: Provides economical set meals, simple banquets, and sporadic snacks. (2) Photography Department: Takes and develops photos. (3) Repair Department: Repairs broken shoes and welds various utensils.</p>
<p>Another department in the office always stocks fresh vegetables, dried vegetables, seasonings, half sheep, pork, etc., which can be purchased at will at Jiuquan market prices. However, during festivals, these items are also distributed in fixed quantities. In terms of food, the Ganqing Oil Mine has been seeking self-sufficiency in recent years. Therefore, it has affiliated farms in Jiayuguan, Chijinbao, and Jiuquan, with more than 600 mu of self-owned land and more than 100 mu of rented land. Each year, it can produce more than 3 million jin of various vegetables and a small amount of grains and miscellaneous grains. It also raises a small number of cattle, sheep, pigs, and poultry to supply meat and milk.</p>
<p>Regarding the many low-priced welfare goods supplied as reported above, how much benefit can each person enjoy? According to Director Wang's statistics, each single employee enjoys a total value of more than 3.8 million yuan in benefits from the difference between the rationed price and the market price. The total value for single laborers is 9.6 million yuan. If they have families, the total value per household is more than 30 million yuan.</p>
<p>Water, Electricity, and Fuel Enjoyed Free of Charge</p>
<p>Employees with families can also enjoy water, electricity, fuel (residual oil or gas), furniture, and utensils free of charge. The first three are delivered to their homes on time. In addition to a Chinese medicine clinic with two Chinese medicine practitioners to treat employees, the mine also has a relatively small hospital. In terms of medical equipment and technology, it has recently established cooperation with Lanzhou Central Hospital, with internal medicine, surgery, dentistry, and midwifery departments, as well as a laboratory and 35 beds. It still lacks X-ray equipment. Two midwives, nine nurses, and ten doctors are busy all day long, with an average of 9,000 consultations per month. Medical treatment and surgery are free of charge. In the past, there were excellent surgeons here, but most have now left. The most common diagnoses in the mining area are colds and dysentery. Other infectious diseases are rare. There are at least 20 appendectomies performed each month.</p>

<h3>General Commodity Prices: Market Trends Mostly Rise First, Then Fall Back</h3>
<p>The currency reform, which has been the central issue of economic problems since the late period of the War of Resistance against Japan and the three years after victory, was finally implemented last Friday. This issue has undergone long-term deliberations by government authorities and numerous discussions by scholars and experts. It is undoubtedly a major measure since the implementation of the legal tender in the 24th year of the Republic (1935) . Its impact on the entire economy in the future is self-evident. I will first mention it here, and this publication will have a special article on it later.</p>
<p>Last week's prices, following the momentum of the previous weekend, mostly hovered at high peaks. In the market, due to rampant rumors, both bulls and bears adopted a wait-and-see attitude, waiting for the announcement of the new plan. By Thursday, on the eve of the currency reform, the rumors became increasingly confirmed, and general prices mostly showed a slight downward trend. From Friday onwards, the new currency system was announced, and the Shanghai and Tianjin stock exchanges were ordered to suspend business. They cannot resume operations without the approval of the Executive Yuan. The financial industry in this city temporarily closed for two days. At the same time, the markets for rice, flour, coal, cotton cloth, silk, miscellaneous grains, edible oil, bean cake, cigarettes, daily necessities, imported goods, timber, foreign paper, and medicinal materials also closed for two days, resuming on Monday this week. Last week's wholesale price index was 8,318,612 times, up 24.94% from the previous week.</p>
<p>Last week's exchange situation of the national banks showed continuous and huge deficits, which was unprecedented. It is estimated that the deficit was more than 410 billion on Monday, more than 340 billion on Wednesday, and more than 250 billion on Thursday. According to analysis, this was due to: (1) repayment of principal and interest on maturing treasury bills, (2) payment of military and government funds, and expenses for purchasing grain and flour, (3) purchase of exchange settlement certificates. In retrospect, this purchase measure was undoubtedly related to the planned currency reform. The unofficial interest rate was around 6 jiao.</p>
<p>Last week, the selling price of exchange settlement certificates gradually increased, from 7.4 million at the beginning of the week to 7.8 million on Thursday. The buying price of gold ornaments at the beginning of the week was 540 million per tael, and the selling price was 580 million per tael, an increase of 20 million the next day, with no change on Wednesday and Thursday. Due to the small unit of silver dollars, which facilitated transactions, both supply and demand were high, and the price rose sharply, from a selling price of 6.8 million at the beginning of the week to 7.8 million on Thursday.</p>
<p>The trend of the commodity market was roughly the same as before. In terms of cotton cloth, 42-count Blue Phoenix was 2.9 billion at the beginning of the week, 3.25 billion on Tuesday, and then back to 3.11 billion on Thursday; 21-count Double Horse was 2.15 billion at the beginning of the week, 2.47 billion on Tuesday, and then back to 3.11 billion on Thursday. Dragon Head fine cloth fell from a peak of 90 million to 88.5 million on Thursday.</p>
<p>Grain prices remained stable. At the beginning of the week, top-grade japonica rice was at 60 million, hovering between 62.3 million from Tuesday to Thursday. Crude oil hovered at 189 million, and Battleship No. 1 flour hovered at 21.2 million. Other items such as daily necessities, chemicals, metals, and building materials also mostly followed this trend, rising first and then falling back.</p>
<p>Last week's wholesale price index classified by use is as follows:</p>
<p>Last week's wholesale price index classified by processing degree is as follows:</p>

<h3>On the New Currency System</h3>
<p>The currency reform, which has been in the works for several years, was finally announced and implemented on August 20. This is a major measure in our country's monetary history since the implementation of the legal tender in the 24th year of the Republic (1935). The birth of this new currency system is based on the provisions of the Temporary Provisions During the Period of Mobilization for the Suppression of Rebellion and was promulgated by the President with an emergency financial and economic decree. Therefore, our view of the gold yuan is very heavy in our hearts.</p>
<p>The standard currency of the new currency system is the gold yuan, with a statutory gold content of 0.22217 grams of pure gold per yuan. However, there is no gold currency circulating on the market, and the gold yuan cannot be freely purchased for foreign exchange. Therefore, the new currency system is a kind of virtual gold standard system, or a managed gold standard system.</p>
<p>Article 10 of the Gold Yuan Issuance Regulations stipulates that the inspection and safekeeping of the gold yuan issuance reserve shall be handled by the Gold Yuan Issuance Reserve Supervisory Committee. Article 13 stipulates that the Gold Yuan Issuance Reserve Supervisory Committee shall, after the end of each month, inspect the amount of gold yuan issued by the Central Bank and the issuance reserve situation, and make an inspection report for public announcement. This spirit of open and independent issuance is roughly similar to the initial implementation of the legal tender. We hope that the government should strictly adhere to it to the end.</p>
<p>Article 8 of the Gold Yuan Issuance Regulations stipulates that the issuance of the gold yuan shall adopt a 100% reserve system. Among the aforementioned issuance reserves, 40% must be gold, silver, and foreign exchange, and the remainder shall be filled with valuable securities and assets of state-owned enterprises designated by the government. This is slightly different from the initial regulations for the issuance of the legal tender, which stipulated that the cash reserve was 60% and the guarantee reserve was 40%.</p>
<p>We look forward to the key to the success or failure of the gold yuan in the future. Although there are many arguments, there is only one key point: whether prices can be stable. If prices are stable, the gold yuan can be said to be a complete success; if prices rise, then the economic crisis in the future is unimaginable. Therefore, in addition to announcing the Gold Yuan Issuance Regulations, the government also announced the Measures for the Handling of Gold, Silver, and Foreign Currency Owned by the People, the Measures for the Registration and Management of Foreign Exchange Assets Deposited Abroad by the People of the Republic of China, and the Measures for Reorganizing Finances and Strengthening Economic Control. On the one hand, it strives to concentrate foreign exchange funds and balance government revenue and expenditure; on the other hand, it makes the greatest determination to stabilize future prices.</p>
<p>Article 9 of the Issuance Regulations stipulates that the total issuance of gold yuan shall be limited to 2 billion yuan. According to the calculation that one gold yuan is equal to 3 million legal tender, 2 billion gold yuan should be equal to 6 trillion legal tender. According to general estimates, the current amount of legal tender issued is about 7-8 trillion, and its actual value is only more than 10% of 2 billion gold yuan. Therefore, although the issuance of gold yuan is limited to 2 billion, it must never be issued to the full amount in a short period of time, because society does not need such a large amount of currency at one time, and at the same time, material resources cannot be increased many times in a short period of time. If the amount of gold yuan issued exceeds the actual value multiple of the current legal tender issuance too much, prices will still rise.</p>
<p>Article 2 of the Measures for Reorganizing Finances and Strengthening Economic Control stipulates that various tax revenues should be effectively increased, and tax rates that are lower than pre-war standards should be adjusted with reference to pre-war standards. Article 3 stipulates that fees for state-owned public utility and transportation undertakings that are lower than pre-war standards shall be allowed to be adjusted with reference to pre-war standards in order to achieve self-sufficiency. This kind of regulation seems to be beyond reproach from the government's standpoint, but it is too far-fetched from the perspective of overall prices. Because if donations and taxes increase, merchants are unwilling to bear them and do not have the ability to bear them. As a result, they will naturally be passed on to consumers, and prices will still rise. Increasing fees for state-owned public utility and transportation undertakings will also increase the production costs of industry and commerce, leading to price increases. Therefore, the government should give more technical consideration when implementing this regulation.</p>
<p>We review the loss of credit of the legal tender. Although the reasons are very diverse, the only thing that is expressed is that prices rise, and the eve of each price surge is always due to the disaster of the flooding of speculative capital. From the perspective of the new plan, it stipulates that the people shall not hold gold, silver, and foreign currency. If the people really follow the government's regulations to exchange them for gold yuan, then the speculative capital on the market may be even more than in the past. How to effectively divert speculative capital and stabilize prices invisibly is a very serious problem. Although public bonds are not a bad way, the effect in the past was not significant. This problem still needs to be carefully considered by the authorities.</p>
<p>In this time's Measures for the Handling of Gold, Silver, and Foreign Currency, it is stipulated that one silver dollar can be exchanged for two gold yuan, one US dollar can be exchanged for four gold yuan, and one tael of gold can be exchanged for 200 gold yuan. However, on the eve of the announcement of the new plan, the black market price of silver dollars was about 2.5 yuan, the black market price of US dollars was about 4 yuan, and the black market price of gold was slightly less than 200 yuan. Judging from the stipulated exchange rate, those who hold silver dollars will suffer a loss, and those who hold gold dollars will get a bargain. It can also be further said that the new plan is somewhat biased towards the interests of wealthy people. Therefore, we hope that the Measures for the Registration and Management of Foreign Exchange Assets can be implemented quickly and faithfully, so that wealthy people can contribute more to the war to suppress the rebellion.</p>
<p>In general, the new plan also has some shortcomings, but it is barely satisfactory. The problem is whether it can be implemented fairly and faithfully to the end, especially when encountering strong resistance or when there is no force, it should be overcome impartially.</p>
<h3>Currency and Finance (1) Unofficial Interest Rates</h3>
<p>This city's money market last week, although on Monday, the salary payment period of the month for the value banks made the demand for funds very high, and it was slightly tight, but subsequently, due to the huge expenditure of the national treasury and the arrival of remittances from other ports, it turned to be loose.</p>
<p>Commercial banks resumed interbank lending, and there were ample orders. Interbank positions were slightly more popular due to the eagerness of those who needed orders. Although cash chips were slightly relieved due to the introduction of 250,000 Customs Gold Unit notes, the discount on large notes was still around 5-6% due to the large number of speculators.</p>
<p>Last week on Thursday, the authorities promulgated the Emergency Financial and Economic Decree, announcing four measures including the issuance of the gold yuan. From that day on, it was stipulated that the gold yuan would be the currency unit, with denominations of one yuan, five yuan, ten yuan, fifty yuan, and one hundred yuan. It also has metal subsidiary coins. 3 million legal tender can be exchanged for one gold yuan. The statutory exchange period is three months. A total of 2 billion new currency will be issued, adopting a 100% reserve system. 40% of it will be gold, silver, and foreign exchange reserves. The so-called currency reform that had been brewing for a long time has finally been realized. In addition, silver and money businesses were ordered to close for two days from Friday to cooperate with this emergency measure. Therefore, the market conditions of the financial industry last week lasted only four days from Monday to Thursday.</p>
<p>Last week's unofficial interest rate generally hovered around 6 jiao. The interest rate for cotton cloth was about 30 yuan for daily lending, and the interest rate for department stores was about 25 yuan for daily lending. The interest rate for securities companies was mostly 29 yuan for buyers and 26 yuan for sellers.</p>
<p>The results of the national bank and bureau treasury exchange showed a total deficit of 946.68 billion from Monday to Thursday. However, the national banks had huge amounts of treasury bill principal and interest to pay on Monday, which were paid by means of account transfers. Therefore, the actual deficit should be more than 1 trillion, and the easing of the money market was greatly affected by it.</p>
<p>From Monday to Thursday, foreign banks had a total surplus of 777.09 billion. In addition to a portion of the proceeds from the sale of exchange settlement certificates, it is said that most of it was capital flight.</p>
<p>The results of the exchange of banks and businesses after the 60th day of last week showed a total deficit of 824.4 billion. The indirect exchange group between commercial banks still had a surplus of more than 1 trillion. The shift to easing in the money market can also be seen in general.</p>
<p>(2) Chinese and Foreign Stock Markets</p>
<p>When the Chinese stock market opened at the beginning of the week, it was fatigued due to the strong rumors of negative news and the active selling by speculative groups, foreign stock groups, and banking groups. In the afternoon, it was heard that the money market was easing, and the situation improved, but most stocks still had difficulty exceeding the closing price of the previous weekend. Yongsha closed at 15,700 yuan, a slight drop from the previous weekend. Rongfeng, Shanghai Cement, and Commercial Press all rose, Xinyi rose to the limit, and the rest fell slightly.</p>
<p>The next day, due to the huge deficit of the national bank and bureau the day before, and the fact that commodity prices outside the circle were rising one after another, the stock market suddenly rose sharply. As a result, all stocks rose uniformly, and 11 stocks including Yongsha, Yongye, Huaci, Jinglun, Dongxing, Rongfeng, Hengfeng, Yonggong, Commercial Press, Zhongxing, and Zhongyi jumped to the limit.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, the reduction in prices of public utilities was realized, and rumors of currency reform were rampant again. Guangbang sold off at high prices, and the market fell slightly. Yongsha closed at 16,980 yuan. Among other stocks, Yongye and Shanghai Cement rose to the limit, Tongyi, Qinxing, Zhonghuo, Zhongni, and Yonggong rose, and the rest fell.</p>
<p>On Thursday, due to rumors that new measures such as the new economic reform plan and currency reform were about to be announced, people were panicked, large investors sold off at high prices, and floating investors cut their losses one after another. The market sentiment was exhausted, and the falling trend was tragic. As a result, except for Huaxin and Shanghai Cement, which rose to the limit, the rest all fell. Among them, Yongsha, Xinnuo, Meiya, Zhabei, and Qinxing all fell to the limit.</p>
<h3>Possible Consequences of the New Economic Program and Currency Reform</h3>
<p>The long-brewing new economic program and currency reform have finally emerged, breaking through various rumors and repeated denials. This cannot be regarded as anything other than a major event in the financial world, and it must be recognized as another historical attempt by the government to improve the current economic situation. From the government's standpoint, such an attempt will naturally have some significant gains. However, whether it will benefit the general public and the business community, in addition to various theoretical inferences, still needs to be proven by facts.</p>
<p>It is worth examining the possible gains that the new economic reform program and currency reform may bring to the government. For ease of analysis, this can be explained in several points:</p>
<p>(1) Centralization of Gold, Silver, and Foreign Exchange Reserves: According to the published reserve ratio for the Gold Yuan notes, of which 40% is calculated as gold, silver, and foreign exchange, the current gold, silver, and foreign exchange reserves in the national treasury are approximately US$200 million. This is close to the estimate of US$150 million in reserves recently published by the Far Eastern Economic Review magazine in Hong Kong. Now that the conversion rate of the Gold Yuan has completely acknowledged the black market prices of gold and foreign exchange (stipulating that one US dollar can be exchanged for 12 million Gold Yuan), and the law strictly prohibits the circulation and holding of gold, silver, and foreign currencies after September 30, it is expected that some cautious small savers of gold, silver, and foreign currencies will release some or all of their savings to deposit or exchange with the Central Bank. In addition, some speculators in gold notes may also shift their funds to other uses due to risk considerations. As for funds or foreign exchange reserves used for fleeing the country, unless the overall domestic situation changes, a mere decree may still be difficult to change their direction of movement. Furthermore, under the favorable conditions of implicitly acknowledging black market prices, income from overseas remittances and export settlements may also increase. In short, the new program may contribute to the centralization of scattered gold, silver, and foreign exchange reserves in the country, but the extent to which they can be centralized mainly depends on the government's credibility with the people, because nationalizing gold and silver is different from nationalizing land; the former is easier to hide and transport.</p>
<p>The new control measures can also be said to spare no effort in saving various foreign exchange expenditures. For example, "The fees for state-owned public utilities and transportation enterprises shall be adjusted with reference to pre-war standards in order to achieve self-sufficiency." For example, "Import quotas, starting from the seventh quarter, shall be reduced by at least one-quarter based on the average standards of the fifth and sixth quarters." Furthermore, in cities such as Shanghai, "Within two months after the promulgation of the measures, the number of various vehicle licenses shall be reduced by one-quarter to one-third, and the amount of fuel used by vehicles shall be strictly limited." This shows how tightly the authorities are controlling the use of foreign exchange. In all fairness, this is because part of the government's foreign exchange has been used for the suppression of the rebellion.</p>
<p>As for dealing with assets held abroad, it is obviously more complicated. Firstly, the so-called "Except for overseas Chinese, all foreign exchange assets held abroad as of August 20, 1948... shall be declared and registered," but the term "overseas Chinese" is not clearly defined. Secondly, it will be impossible to investigate some wealthy families who hold their assets in the names of foreigners. Thirdly, unless the laws of the countries where the assets are located are changed, it will be impossible for the government to "negotiate with the foreign governments concerned for confiscation." It can be seen that the so-called "Measures for the Registration and Management of Foreign Exchange Assets Held Abroad by Citizens of the Republic of China" may still be quite far from actual implementation.</p>
<p>(2) Regarding Balancing the Budget and Managing Prices: Most economists believe that the success or failure of currency reform depends on whether the budget can be balanced. The new program stipulates that the method of balancing the budget, in addition to the so-called saving of expenses and selling surplus materials that have been talked about for a long time, seems to focus on actually "increasing various tax revenues." It also stipulates that "Tax rates lower than pre-war standards shall be adjusted with reference to previous standards." Whether the business community can bear the increased tax rates compared to pre-war levels is certainly a question. However, the price increases caused by the increase in tax rates are at least highly likely. This is the first point. Furthermore, the fees for state-owned public utilities are also adjusted "with reference to pre-war standards in order to achieve self-sufficiency," and the stimulation of prices is also difficult to be optimistic about. This is the second point. The reduction in import quotas can cause imported goods to rise in price. This is the third point. The approximation of export settlements to the black market is certainly a stimulus to export materials. This is the fourth point. Various factors related to the overall economic situation are closely related to each other. If there is still a large loophole in the budget that cannot be filled, then moving east to make up for the west will involve each other, and prices will still have to rise. Some of the expected results of the currency reform may also disappear one by one. The authorities are also aware of this, so in the new program, they reiterate the strengthening of controls to stabilize the foundation of the new currency.</p>
<p>(3) Using Political Laws and Decrees to Strengthen Economic Control: In addition to the aforementioned general increase in tax revenue, the government has also decided that it "shall not make loans of a commercial nature in any way." At the same time, "The minimum capital amount of banks, money shops, and trust companies in each district shall be formulated with reference to the pre-war Banking Law, and the minimum capital amount shall be increased to the minimum capital amount within two months, and the cash capital increase shall not be less than 50%." Otherwise, "All shall be ordered to suspend business and liquidate within a time limit." The crackdown on the banking industry can be said to be not small. Not only that, but the stock exchanges in Shanghai and Tianjin have been ordered to suspend business temporarily, and later "Newspapers, dispatches, and other printed materials shall not record the black market prices of gold, silver, foreign exchange, and various important daily necessities." Control can be said to have reached the extreme. As for the so-called cost of living index that ordinary people care about, it has also become a historical relic. Originally, under the disguised policy of "freezing" the cost of living index, unless prices remain stable for a long time, it will inevitably cause conflict and confrontation between labor and management. Therefore, the new measures further "prohibit the blockade of factories, strikes, and slowdowns. Violators shall be punished in accordance with Article 5, Paragraph 4 of the Provisional Regulations on Punishment for Obstructing the National Mobilization Law." The laws and decrees on whether or not the so-called prices of various goods and services can be raised still have a flexible phrase, "Those with special reasons shall not be allowed to increase prices without the approval of the competent authorities." Therefore, labor-management disputes may still be unavoidable in the future under the new laws and decrees. This is indeed something that the authorities need to carefully consider and implement cautiously.</p>
<p>It is certainly too early to make a judgment on the new program promulgated by the authorities and predict its success or failure. However, theoretical speculation is not only not superfluous, but also necessary, because we feel that the current economic crisis is serious, and the new currency system can only succeed and not fail. We have high expectations and strict supervision. We hope that the authorities will be deeply vigilant and implement this new measure fairly and practically.</p>

<h3>National Yingshi University</h3>
<p>— This Newspaper Jinhua Correspondent Jiang Feng</p>
<p>Born in the flames of war, grew up on the battlefield, and seeks progress in stability!</p>
<p>[This Newspaper, Jinhua Correspondence] Yingshi University is the youngest little brother among the national universities in the country. The motive for establishing Yingshi University was in 1938. At that time, universities in Southeast China were threatened by the enemy and moved inland one after another. High school graduates were restricted by transportation and could not go to inland areas to study. The Zhejiang provincial authorities, in view of this, intended to establish a university to accommodate young people who could not go to the rear to study. After the 1025th meeting of the provincial government was passed, Xu Shaodi, Gu Zhenggang, Ruan Jingcheng, Huang Zubei, Ren Yanxiang, Zhao Zengjue, Wang Jie, Huang Zhuming, etc. were appointed as members of the preparatory committee to be responsible for the preparations. The preparations were completed in October 1939. At that time, the war on the eastern battlefield was extremely fierce, and Yingshi University was born in the flames of war. The Zhejiang provincial government originally planned to name it Zhejiang Provincial Wartime University in order to train talents needed during the war to meet the needs of resisting the war and building the country. Later, the Ministry of Education believed that the university must be permanent, and President Chiang had long intended to establish a university to commemorate the martyr Chen Yingshi. Mr. Yingshi happened to be from Zhejiang, so it was officially named Yingshi University.</p>
<p>In the early spring of 1943, Chen Lifu took over the Ministry of Education and believed that the school needed to be adjusted and expanded, so he decided to change Yingshi University into a national university. On the one hand, the Department of Law and the Department of Art of the Southeast Associated University were transferred to Yingshi University, and on the other hand, the Department of Engineering was separated to independently establish the National Beiyang Institute of Technology. It also handled the administrative, financial, and accounting special courses on behalf of Zhejiang Province. At that time, there were three departments of agriculture, medicine, and law, and five special courses of art, cooperation, administration, finance, and accounting. In the summer of 1944, Zhu Jiahua took over the Ministry of Education and reorganized higher education. The medical department of Yingshi University was merged with the Zhejiang Provincial Medical College (the reason was that the academic system was different. Yingshi University has recently been approved to continue to establish a medical department, and it can be restored as soon as the school building problem is solved.) The Beiyang Institute of Technology was again transferred to Yingshi University to establish a Department of Engineering. The special courses of cooperation and art were discontinued. In the autumn of 1946, President He Gu was approved to add a Department of Literature and Science. The special courses of administration, finance, and accounting were ended one after another and no longer continued to enroll students.</p>
<p>Now, except for the medical department, which is still to be gradually restored, Yingshi University has four departments and seventeen departments. The Department of Literature and Science has departments of Chinese Literature, History, Physics, and Mathematics; there are also departments of Philosophy, Chemistry, and Foreign Languages that have not yet enrolled students. The Department of Law has departments of Economics, Political Science, and Law (divided into three groups: Administrative Law, Theoretical Law, and Judicial Law.) The Department of Agriculture has departments of Agronomy, Agricultural Economics, Forestry, and Animal Husbandry. The Department of Engineering has departments of Civil Engineering, Chemical Engineering, Mechanical Engineering, and Electrical Engineering.</p>
<p>All former presidents believed that the most important thing in personnel matters was professors; if the professors are good, the school will be good, "With professors, there is a school." However, because it is located in the interior of Zhejiang Province and transportation is not as convenient as Beijing and Shanghai, it is more difficult to hire celebrities. However, in recent years, all former presidents have worked hard to hire professors. The current president is Tang Jihe. The Dean of Academic Affairs is Cai Binmou, the Dean of Student Affairs is Zhao Xixian, and the Dean of General Affairs is Yan Juhua. There are also many well-known figures in the faculty, such as Wen Shi, Cha Mengji, Zhang Zongyuan, Jiang Liangtian, and Yang Deyun in the Department of Literature and Science; Zhu Zuhui, Mei Zhongxie, Zhao Wenbing, and Liu Zhifan in the Department of Law; Fan Yunqian, Fang Ti, Xu Dou, and Wang Binhai in the Department of Agriculture; and Wang Guisun, Wang Ziyu, Wang Zuwu, and Jiang Chao in the Department of Engineering.</p>
<p>There are currently nearly 1,000 students in the school. Because it is limited to the fact that there is no permanent school building, it cannot enroll as many students as possible. There are about 160 graduates this year.</p>
<p>Yingshi University after the restoration has been slightly turbulent, and the most difficult thing is the problem of school buildings. After moving to Jinhua, except for the Department of Literature and Science, which has a temporary school building, the other departments, schools, and the general office are all rented and repaired for use, and most of them are temporary. President Tang has tried his best to raise funds for the construction of school buildings, but because the cost is too high, the current financial resources of the Ministry of Education cannot bear it, so he has to proceed gradually. It has now been decided to build Yingshi Memorial Hall and Yingshi Library at Gaocun, about eight miles from the city at the foot of Beishan in Jinhua, and a committee has been established to be responsible for the project. Other school buildings are planned to be built with funds allocated by the Ministry of Education in order to gradually realize the plan. This is also President Tang Jihe's approach of "seeking progress steadily from stability." Yingshi University is obviously gradually moving towards the light.</p>
<h3>The Second Municipal Student Swimming Competition: Over One Hundred Male and Female Students Participate; Held at the Hongkou Pool the Day After Tomorrow</h3>
<p>The Second Shanghai Municipal Student Swimming Championship, sponsored by the Municipal Sports Field, will be held as scheduled at the Hongkou Swimming Pool on the 25th of this month (Wednesday), regardless of weather changes. The competition will begin at 8:30 AM and 5:00 PM, concluding in one day. Ms. Li Ximou, daughter of Director Li, will present the awards. Registration closed at 6:00 PM the day before yesterday. A total of 88 male students from universities and middle schools, 7 female students from universities and middle schools, and 19 students from elementary schools have registered, totaling 114 participants, which can be described as unprecedentedly enthusiastic. These emerging talents are the new blood of the swimming community. In particular, the breaststroke of Sun Guangyi and Sun Guanger from Gezhi Middle School, the freestyle of Liang Wenzhi from Fuxing Middle School, the backstroke of Chen Yuntai from Gezhi, the freestyle of Jiang Weiliang and Wei Jihua from St. John's University, the freestyle of Pang Meixiong from Datong University, and the breaststroke of Shen Yipeng from Fudan University have all achieved considerable success. The Wang Tiesheng and Wang Gangsheng brothers from Jiaotong University are also not to be underestimated. Dongwu's strongman Qian Renze did not register, and St. John's ace Cao Xingkang also did not participate due to a foot injury. In the women's group, because Liu Tianjuan from St. John's is in Hong Kong, all participants have a chance to win. There are many young talents in the elementary school group, and special achievements are expected to emerge. Among them, Xu Dingjiu from the Municipal Hongkou Pool Elementary School will surely make a name for himself. The number cloths for athletes in each group will be distributed starting tomorrow afternoon at the Hongkou Swimming Pool, and the competition schedule and group lists will also be announced tomorrow.

<h3>Jiangwan Swimming Pool Initiates Open Swimming Competition; Scheduled to Be Held Before the End of This Month</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Jiangwan Swimming Pool Management Committee held its second plenary meeting at the Municipal Gymnasium yesterday.

It was decided that the swimming pool would remain open until the 29th, and an open swimming competition would be held in the city before the end of the month, jointly organized by the Jiangwan Swimming Pool, the Hongkou Swimming Pool, and the Swimming Committee of the Shanghai Sports Association. According to the Jiangwan Swimming Pool, since its opening more than 20 days ago, due to inconvenient transportation, the income has only been over 10 billion yuan, which is not enough to cover expenses, and with the weather turning cooler, it is necessary to close early. However, since the post-war period, there has not been a formal open competition in Shanghai, resulting in low technical standards and a disastrous defeat in the National Games, and there are no formal records for comparison. Therefore, if the temperature permits, it will be maintained until the end of the month to hold a grand competition for the swimming community to learn and observe. It is said that detailed measures are being drafted and will be announced in the next few days. Those in this city who love swimming are encouraged to prepare to participate and support the event.

<h3>Also Talking About Hollywood</h3>
<p>— Shi Yu</p>
<p>Hollywood has influenced the behavior and morals of millions of people and controlled the thoughts and emotions of millions of people. It presumptuously decides your outlook on life for you; it unintentionally paves the road of life for you. You go to the cinema for fun, but when you come out, it has already "educated" you. Betty Grable's thighs and Joan Crawford's shoulders are not just entertaining you. Charles Boyer, a veteran of the love scene, has become a model for how many sensitive fellows should act? Once "Gone with the Wind" was released, that "Gone with the Wind" novel actually sold an extra million copies. All of this is enough to show that Hollywood has a deeply rooted power, but whether that power is good or bad is worth considering. The [Blank] magazine has quite the ambition to answer this question. It sent out hundreds of letters, soliciting opinions from all sides. In general, with the exception of producers and film executives, almost everyone is attacking Hollywood. They listed twelve charges, completely "exposing the family secrets."</p>
<p>Hollywood's biggest crime is distorting facts and giving people a morbid education. Educators and historians loudly attack the unfaithfulness of biographical films, saying that Tyrone Power in "Suez" portrayed the solemn Lesseps as a playboy, and that "A Song to Remember" also absurdly depicted the life of Chopin. Hollywood often depicts many professionals with great disrespect, to the point that people think that American journalists are mostly alcoholics, lawyers are mostly cunning, and psychiatrists are mostly naive. Hollywood's ridicule of non-whites is most likely to hinder international understanding. The blacks we see on the screen are either stretching their necks to tap dance or are like organ ghosts. The average person hardly knows that there are also black educators and entrepreneurs in the United States. To this day, whenever there are Chinese people on the screen, then shrouds, queues, and water pipes will still be brought out to make white people laugh. Sociologists have been complaining about Hollywood's encouragement of drunkenness, manufacturing of divorces, and stimulation of crime for twenty years. A young woman told the judge the reason for her divorce: "Hasn't that female star divorced five times already?" Various novel love films have caused people's concepts of chastity to become increasingly weak, and they regard marriage as child's play. Many people feel that divorce is something to boast about, so divorce cases are piling up. The increase in juvenile crime is largely due to the suggestion of James Cagney's so-called "daring." It is estimated that 33 million American young masters go to the cinema every lunar period. Theater owners get a headache when they see this group of young masters because they often chisel through seats, use slingshots in the lobby, and even set fires!</p>
<p>Hollywood has been around in China for decades. In this city, I am afraid that not a few are inextricably linked to it. But what has Hollywood given us? I have many friends who have to watch Western movies three times a week. And they never make a choice. I am sure that the "education" they get from Hollywood is more than they get from school. They are almost all clever, well-groomed, whistling, and shrugging their shoulders. Everything has a strong buttery taste. They are all pursuing a scholar's dream. This "scholar" is also being pursued by many Europeans, namely: "An income of $50,000 a year, a refrigerator, a car, and the ability to divorce at any time when you feel annoyed."</p>
<p>We have given Hollywood a lot of foreign exchange, and Hollywood naturally has to give us something!</p>

<h3>The Death of Mr. Zhu Ziqing (Part 2)</h3>
<p>— Xie Bingying</p>
<p>The above is an introduction to Mr. Ziqing's resume and his works. Below, I would also like to describe his illness and his poverty, which I think readers are most concerned about and willing to know.</p>
<p>As early as twenty years ago, Mr. Ziqing had duodenal inflammation. In 1941, it is said that he had an X-ray in a hospital in Chengdu and found signs of gastric ulcer, but Mr. Ziqing did not pay attention. He devoted his entire spirit to academic research and forgot about his health. Starting in May of this year, his body weakened to the extreme. He, who never asked for leave, is now asking for leave. On the morning of August 6th, he suddenly had severe stomach pain. He thought it was appendicitis. He went to the Peking University Affiliated Hospital for treatment at 11:00 AM that day. After examination and photography by the doctor, it was determined to be a gastric ulcer. He underwent surgery at 2:00 PM, which took 40 minutes. The surgery went very well. During the surgery, it was found that the duodenum was rotten with a hole about half an inch long and a quarter of an inch wide, so the doctor quickly sewed it up. According to Dr. Zhang, ordinary patients undergoing surgery with general anesthesia require a dose of up to 200 or 300 cc, but for Mr. Ziqing this time, he was afraid that he would not be able to bear it, so he only used 100 cc. After waking up, he was in good spirits and said to his friends who came to see him, "The surgery was really fast, it was over in a quarter of an hour!"</p>
<p>The next day, an examination of the urine revealed protein and granular casts. The doctor determined that he had nephritis. At this time, doctors from internal and external departments studied in detail. The most difficult problem to solve was that if he only had a gastric ulcer, he could not eat, and he could inject a little more glucose and saline, but with nephritis added, it was troublesome, because it was the opposite of the former, and he could not inject glucose and saline. According to Dr. Zhang, Mr. Zhu's temperature has not been high since he was hospitalized, always around 37 degrees, but he urinates very little. After four days, his hands and feet were sometimes cold. On the 11th, he gradually urinated more, and his face was not as pale as in the previous days, and he seemed to have returned to normal. He also had a bowel movement that night. But the next day, the situation changed again. When Mr. Zhu exerted himself to have a bowel movement at 9:20, he suddenly felt particularly difficult to breathe. Originally, he had been using oxygen to help him breathe and injecting glucose and plasma these days. At 11:30, Mr. Zhu's life had reached its most dangerous stage. His pulse stopped, and his last breath was cut off. He said farewell to this dirty and chaotic world with infinite pain and reluctance!</p>
<p>It is said that he only said one sentence when he was dying, in a very subtle voice: "The doctors have done their best!" Finally, he waved to his youngest daughter, who came closer. He took one last look and closed his eyes.</p>
<p>Mrs. Zhu, Chen Zhuyin, saw her dearest person die with her own eyes. She fainted at that time. The first thing she said when she woke up was: "Quickly send a telegram to your eldest brother and second brother!" Sadly, their second son, Run Sheng, remitted a sum of money from Nanjing on the 11th, but his father could not enjoy it.</p>
<p>Mr. Ziqing left behind four sons and four daughters, four children each from his first wife and his second wife. His youngest daughter is only ten years old and is studying at Qinghua Chengzhi Elementary School. This is his most beloved little baby. Mr. Ziqing was honest and upright throughout his life. After his death, during the funeral, he could not find a decent piece of clothing, which was really miserable!</p>
<p>Most writers have a common habit: they don't like to fill out resumes. Once, a famous professor wrote "An Old Man" on his resume and sent it back to the school where he taught. Mr. Ziqing's temperament was a bit similar, and he never liked to fill out forms. The National Peiping Library once asked him to fill out a form. He said, "I have never liked to fill out forms in my life, so I will not comply." This spring, another form was sent to him, still asking him to fill it out. He replied, "When I am teaching, I often feel inconvenient when I want to introduce a certain writer to my students because of the lack of materials. This time you want me to fill out a form, and I will never refuse!" (The general idea) So he filled out a very detailed form. This article about Mr. Ziqing's resume and works is based on the form he filled out himself.</p>
<p>Mr. Ziqing is dead. Although his body has been cremated to ashes, his spirit is entrusted to his works, influencing thousands of young intellectuals, forever immortal, and forever shining brilliantly in the literary world! (August 15, 1948, in the ancient capital.) Jin Lin</p>
<h3>Quirks</h3>
<p>— Jin Lin</p>
<p>American writer Hawthorne always washed his hands before reading his wife's letters.</p>
<p>British writer Farrer wrote all his works standing up.</p>
<p>British novelist Stevenson insisted on using purple ink.</p>
<p>French philosopher Rousseau liked to wear black gloves in the summer. When he traveled abroad, he insisted on packing the things in the box separately.</p>
<h3>The Sinking of Liuyi Town</h3>
<p>— Suo Bei</p>
<p>Liuyi Town on the Yangtze River in Yangzhou suddenly sounded a blast on the 16th of this month, and the entire town sank. The former prosperous streets did not leave a trace. The small society that was once a transportation hub where merchants and travelers stopped has disappeared into the rushing east flow in an instant! Mulberry fields turn into seas, and human affairs are impermanent. It can be regarded as the common sense of the universe, or it can be regarded as the sorrow of the "spirit of all things," whose splendor and all civilizations are often built on beaches that can sink at any time (or after countless years).</p>
<p>Don't accuse me of "raising the alarm": Liuyi Town can sink in an instant, and the Shanghai Bund is unlikely to be preserved in an instant! Doesn't the Shanghai stratum sink by one or two inches every year? It is difficult to say that the entire oasis will never end, let alone the alluvial beach formed by Shanghai.</p>
<p>Indeed, natural sinking may occur in hundreds of millions of years, but haven't you heard that countless people are working on the manufacture of atomic bombs (or super atomic bombs)? In that case, the "spirit of all things" not only does not consider whether natural sinking can be prevented, but is also working on artificial sinking!</p>
<p>The ancient old capital recently saw the passing of another old scholar. Lu Jing, styled Muzhai, a successful candidate in the Hubei provincial examinations, formerly served as the education commissioner of Zhili and Fengtian provinces during the late Qing dynasty. Renowned for his collection of books and archaeological studies, he passed away on the tenth of this month at the age of ninety-four! Adding the intercalary month, he could be considered a centenarian. This venerable gentleman, alongside Li Shengduo of Jiangxi (a successful candidate placed second in the imperial examinations, deceased for many years), were equally matched in the richness of their collections and the accuracy of their appraisals, remarkably both using "Muzhai" as their sobriquet.</p>
<p>August 8th is Father's Day. Wu Zhihui, the venerable gentleman who inscribed the calligraphy (as seen in the copperplate print in the Japanese newspaper), is eighty-four years old, more than a decade older than the average septuagenarian, truly a person of exceptional longevity, yet still ten years younger than the venerable Lu. General Sa (Zhenbing) of Fujian province, who celebrated his ninetieth birthday, is four years younger than Lu. The Shanghai resident Chen (Kuilong), formerly a high-ranking official, is now ninety-two, two years older than Sa but still two years younger than Lu. (Editor's note: Chen Yonglao passed away on August 17th.) When Marshal Pétain of the Vichy French puppet government sought peace with Germany in 1940, he was already eighty-four years old (equivalent to the Chinese age of eighty-five), and now he should be ninety-two (Chinese age ninety-three), still one number behind Lu.</p>
<p>Old Wu's inscription uses an interesting combination of the ancient seal script and modern analysis of the character "father." According to reports, "Father's Day" was originally jointly proposed five years ago by Dr. Yen Hui-ching, Dr. Mei Lanfang, and other prominent figures residing in Shanghai, on the grounds that "both father and mother should be equally honored and valued. Knowing the father but not the mother is contrary to human nature, but knowing the mother and not the father is surely a matter of regret?" It is a parallel phrase that is both sincere and elegant. The explanation of the character's form states: "The linked eights resemble the character 'father' and the sound is similar to 'baba' (dad)." This also demonstrates ingenuity.</p>
<p>The relative importance and closeness of father and mother are difficult to express in a single sentence. Generally speaking, in early human history, when the patriarchal system was incomplete, people were born from the mother and raised in her arms, so they knew only the mother and not the father. Later, as the family was established, ethics became clearer, male authority became dominant, and women had to follow their husbands. The relationship between parents showed a clear distinction in importance. The father's relatives were regarded as the head of the family, while the mother's side was considered the "outside family." Although both parents are addressed together in the same hall, in terms of the family, it is almost as if "one knows only the father and not the mother." Although Western families also value the male lineage, there is no difference in the closeness between relatives on the father's and mother's sides. Therefore, Roosevelt married his "cousin." In China, marrying a "cousin" is common, but marrying a "paternal cousin" is considered "incestuous" - that is unthinkable! In fact, the distance between uncles and maternal uncles, aunts and maternal aunts, paternal and maternal cousins of the same generation, is exactly the same on both parents' sides, and it is perfectly reasonable to refer to both sides with the same terms. As for the Western custom of having a Mother's Day, it is said that when soldiers were serving in the military, the elderly mother leaned against the door, or if the soldiers died in military service, the mother's grief and disappointment were even greater than the father's. Therefore, there is a special reason for having a Mother's Day, and it is not to show partiality between the two parents. The establishment of "Father's Day" by prominent figures in China is not unacceptable, and there is no need to make an unfair outcry. Both can coexist or go their own way.</p>
<p>(Editor's note: Western countries also have Father's Day, when children give gifts to their fathers, but the holiday falls on the third Sunday in June each year, which is different from our country's Father's Day.)</p>
<h3>Escape from Death</h3>
<p>— Ye Qiu</p>
<p>In 1926, in a state prison in Florida, USA, there was a black prisoner named Jem Williams, who was sentenced to death and scheduled for execution. On the day of the execution, the warden and the district chief in charge of the case called out Williams, strapped him to the electric chair, and put the black mask on his head, waiting for the button to be pressed to pass the electricity. Unexpectedly, both the prison official and the district chief were very soft-hearted people, and everyone shirked responsibility and refused to act. The two men argued for twenty minutes without a resolution, while Williams suffered in the electric chair for twenty minutes. As a result, the authorities ordered Williams to be untied and sent back to his cell. Later, the judge felt that Williams' twenty minutes of "waiting to die" was already a heavy punishment, so he reduced his sentence to life imprisonment. Eight years later, Williams risked his life to save two people on the prison farm. The judge saw that he still knew justice and released him.</p>
