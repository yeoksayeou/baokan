<h3>美將派代表團來華　兩院聯席會議通國援外折衷方案　送交總統簽署後即執行</h3>
<p>〔中央社華盛頓一日電〕美參·衆兩院聯席會議，一日晚通過六十億九千八百萬元全世界援助法案，其中規定以三億三千八百萬元作爲對華之經濟援助，另以一億二千五百萬元贈與中國；後一筆贈款，中國政府可以用於軍事目的。全部援華計劃之期限爲一年。上述法案於一日晚十一時後通過，業已送交國會之兩院，兩院將於二日晨迅速通過此折衷方案，而將其送交白宮，請杜魯門總統簽署，聯席會議將參院援華計劃中關於法案目的之字句刪去一部，並變更援助之數目後，即將該計劃予以通過，參院援華計劃中所予中國之經濟援助被减少二千五百萬元，而成爲三像三千八百萬元，但贈與中國而可由中國政府用於軍事目的之數，則被增至一億二千五百萬。聯席會議對衆院所提成立「中美農村建設聯合委會〕及規定以經濟援華中百分之五至百分之十之數作爲進行中國農村建設之用之建議，亦予以通過。在國會撥款執行援華計劃之前，復興銀公司將墊付五千萬元。聯席會議幷通過其關於援華目的之序言。被刪除之參院援華序言稱：「援助中國對於减輕人民痛苦，延緩經濟惡化及予中國以利用自助方式以復興經濟之機　，實屬必需。」新序言稱：美國畀予中國援助之目的及政策，首在鼓勵中國及其人民竭盡其　久之共同努力，以加速完成國內之和平及經濟穩定；其次在鼓勵中國保特眞正之獨立及政府之完整；第三爲經過基於自助及合作之援助計劃，以保持並加强個人之自由及自由制度。對華援助係根據包括歐洲復原計劃之所有援助法案中經濟合作法之適當規定進行，此點之意義爲對華之經濟援助將由掌管歐洲復原計劃事宜之同一執行人執行之。美國將派代表團赴華，以保證其計劃之有效實施。援助將基於一雙邊協定援華法案中，並未規定中國在雙邊協定中所將同意之特別任務，以保證上述款項正爲法案之目的作有效之利用；但該案特別規定中國應採取各種措施，以改善兩國商務關係。美國與歐洲復原計劃中各國間雙邊協定中之規定如增加生產，穩定通貨及協助以戰略原料運往美國等保證，將爲中美協定談判之指南·援華法案中僅規定以一億二千五百萬元完全贈與中國政府，而未論及軍事援助，故該法案可謂未對中國作軍事援助之約定。經濟計劃一如國會委會所扼述，將包括根據經濟計劃執行人裁奪，以贈予或貸予之款項所購買之重要進口物資·執行人對於即將從事之農村建設計劃，亦可加以決定。所有援外法案中並核准：（一）五十三億元之歐洲復原計劃，此一計劃每年均須經過核准及撥款之手續，（一）二億七千五百萬元對土。希之　　軍事援助，（三）六千萬作爲國際兒童緊急救濟基金。</p>

<h3>國大紀程　下臺不易上臺難</h3>
<p>本報特寫（四月二日於南京）</p>
<p>預備會議開到第四天，主席團還不能產生，主席團是有機會坐上主席台的，有人希望上台，困難重重，曾坐過主席臺的人，如胡適，于斌等，在會衆紛紛發言，呼叫，甚至指斥主席時，却又感到下台不易。于斌主敎在偸閑的時候，悄悄擦去額上的汗珠，也許在想，我求下台不可得，諸君何以如此奮勇要求登台？直到十二時十分，宣布第五次預備會議將由莫德惠主席時，于主敎該感到輕鬆了。</p>
<p>雖然今天會議情形比較最平靜無波，减少了紊亂，消逝了噓聲，但這唯一的決議還是福建區域代表林紫貴大聲疾呼爭取來的。主席曾擬以主席團選舉辦法的修正案付表決，正準備代表們掀撳電鈕時，有人大聲指斥主敎曲解條文，曲解與會各代表三天來的意見，于主敎鐵靑着臉，幾乎無法下台。時間已到十二時，是法定休會期間，孫繩武建議：將各代表意見交秘書處綜合整理，兼顧單位及人才，提出三日會議討論。這原是解圍之策，但會衆的情緒却不能由此而解，林紫貴從席次上跳將出來，對準麥克風，大叫：「請諸位注意！我們在這裏開會一夭，國庫公款要損失七十億以上，我們怎能開一天會沒有結果？今天要不管開到什麼時候，也要討論完畢」！他的話頗有效力，也帮助了于主席。於是于斌馬上抓住這種羣衆情緒：「看各位的意思，是不願意毫無結果而散，現在我們且試試，先拿第二草案付表決，若通不過，再拿第一草案付表決。即使兩個方案都通不過，我們還可以再擬定第三草案」。一致掌聲之後，表決器放射出五彩光芒，二一四一票對八二〇票，多數通過第二草案，有人還想說話，于斌祗好自已找機會下台：「延長時間已滿，散會」！</p>
<p>國大組織法經立法院通過修正爲主席團八十五人後，籌委會原擬的主席團選舉辦法已不適用，于斌主席希望博採衆議，任代表們發言，三時發言條如雪片一樣，飛上主席合，一會兒便積了很高。有些代表不願自己發言，就把意見寫在紙上，請秘書長代讀，這可苦了喉嚨已啞的洪蘭友，幾乎一小時的時間，由他一個人唱獨脚戲，幸而有人還要自己發言，洪蘭友纔看機會吃一盃茶。于斌說：意見有許多人相同的，以後有新意見的宣讀，沒有新意見的僅宣讀名字，電也解救了洪蘭友。主席台上于·洪二氏彼此體貼協助，合作到最圓滿的地步。</p>
<p>將近百位代表的意見，大多數有一致的看法。第一，希望作到每一單位有一代表參加主席團。第二，自由職業團體中的六個單位，應該個別產生主席，參加主席團。第三，直接選舉，由各單位分別選舉，不必總名單。第四，每單位一人之外的餘額，有人主張依單位人數比例增加，有人主張餘額普選。第五，各單位選舉，可提二倍或三倍候選人，但各單位單獨計票，保證每單位有一人參加主席團。關於婦女名額，有人主張單獨計票，某代表且主張「男女分別投票」。此外，最値得重視的意見，是「現任高級官吏不得爲主席國候選人」。謝鴻軒說：「現任高級官吏參加主席團，有代國大行使職權的嫌疑」！有人鼓掌，有人長嘶。不論這些意見如何，他們的目的都是一個：「上台」！即使有人上台聲明絕不作主席，甚至舉出制憲國大被選出而辭職的前例，究是鳳毛麟角。</p>
<p>主席是辛勞的，休息時他不得休息，匆匆間擬出一個選舉辦法的第一草案，于斌解釋說，這是容納了各代表的意見，但他堅持「互選」一點，沒有規定各單位自選的辦法。辦法草案大體上與潘公展等所提意見相合，一面各單位各選候選人一名，一面代表十人可合推一人，于斌的辦法是用無記名連記法選舉，這不僅使當選困難，且增加開票時技術上的困難，有人大喊反對，說是有人包辦操縱，根本忽略了三天來大家討論的意見，那意見是什麼呢？每單位自行選舉一人。于斌在台上耐着性，解釋他沒有曲解，沒有操縱，且根據修正的意見，改無記名連記法爲無記各單記法，提出第二草案，這樣，使有廿五票的人就可以當選了。</p>
<p>無論如何，第二草案總算通過了，雖然有人還不滿意，子斌下臺，長噓一口氣，三日，他可以不必上台了，可是，根據通過的選舉辦法，二日下午，晚上，三日上午，不知有若干人在爭取上台的機會呢。</p>

<h3>社論　泛美會議的主題</h3>
<p>第九居泛美會議於三月三十日在哥倫比亞首都開幕之後，即依照議事日程進行，現已觸及本屆會議議題的核心；廿一　代表威　於共產勢力潛入世界各處的危被，益感西半球各國有通力合作加强聯繫的必要。美國務卿馬歇爾於會議開幕之日，提出「由美洲國家調查外國對美洲各國制度，和平，安全所作的秘密活動」一項問題，即獲得與會各國代表的一致擁護，由此可知，泛美各國的休戚相關利益相共了。所以我們實有充分的理由，可以相信，這次泛美會議必能獲得圓滿結果。</p>
<p>以這次泛美會議的議題而論，最重要的，有下列三項：（一）設立美洲永久防務委員會，以實施去年九月問在巴西京城所簽訂的泛美聯防公約；這個公約已於去年十二月八日爲大國國會所批准。（二）簽訂泛美經濟合作協定，拉丁美洲各國爲了本國的經濟復興，莫不需要美國的金元，機械，設備的協助，所以大家希望馬歇爾也能提出一個類似「援歐計劃」的「援美計劃」。（三）建立泛美和平制度，務使美洲各國間的任何爭端，均能獲得和平解決。綜上三點，一方面可知這次泛美會議的重要，除了軍事問題而外，還有更重要的經濟問題；所以美國代表團一行九十餘人，除了馬歇爾國務卿而外，尙有商務部長哈里曼與進出口銀行理事長馬丁，足見美國政府對於這次泛美會議的重視。在另一方面也可以知道，美國旣欲在軍事上獲得泛美各國的通力合作，在經濟方面美國對於泛美各國的願望必須予以相當的滿足。美國經濟援助拉丁美洲各國，在原則上是絕無問題的；但是在目前，美國援外的重點正集中在歐洲方面，對於拉丁美洲各國能不能同時也來一個「馬歇爾計劃」？却是一個　重問題。</p>
<p>回首泛美會議去年在巴西京城舉行會議的時候，墨西哥代表即該國外長波台特，曾一再强調美洲國家間經濟合作的重要，絃外之音，不言可知。因爲從一九四二年以來，美國在租借法案下貸與拉丁美洲各國的借款，總額僅及七億九千六百萬美元；但是這筆借款，早已用完了；因在大戰期間，美國集中全國的人力物力，對德日作戰；故拉丁美洲各國自然也不便時時向美國要求貸款。但至大戰結束之後，情勢已經變遷，而拉丁美洲各國的需要美元，也與日俱增，爲謀國內的經濟復興，更非取得美國的經濟援助不可。波臺特外長所謂經濟合作，就是指「美援」而言；可是美國代表始終堅特，首先討論西半球的聯防問題，大有不先實行軍事合作則經濟合作就無從談起之意，因此拉丁美洲各國的代表也就徇從美國的意旨，完成了這個泛美聯防公約；而將經濟合作問題，留待來日從長計議，所以本屆泛美會議的主題，乃在經濟合作問題。</p>
<p>但自巴西京城會議結束後，美國當局以泛美聯防公約旣已完成，對於西半球的防務以爲已無問題，因此其注意力，一直集中在歐洲方面，除對希土實行杜魯門主義而外，馬歇爾計劃也在積極進行之中，先有緊急援歐法案的爲國會所通過，而今國會又正在討論長期援歐的大規模計劃，所需美元的鉅大，尤爲前所未有。怎能不引起拉丁美洲各國的嫉視呢？我們研究拉丁美洲各國代表的心理，可以說完全是這樣的：美國要西半球實行聯防，要拉丁美洲各劉一致支持美國的反蘇新政策，在原則上都是沒有問題的；但是有一個條件，就是美國對於拉丁美洲各國也要來一個「馬歇爾計劃」。據合衆肚的報道：哥倫比亞代表已提出了一個「小馬歇爾計劃」，主張由美國貸與五十億美元，由一個國際金融公司管理，以供拉丁美洲各國增加生產之用。準此而論，馬歇爾擬要求國會撥款五億美元，貸與拉丁美洲各國，　未必能滿足拉丁美洲各國的願望，馬歇爾於一日在會議中演說，他也一再說明美國目前的困難，而要求泛美各國的諒解，他說：『美國雖已準備擴大其歷年來給予美洲國家的經濟協助之規模，惟鑒於其他方面的迫切要求，美國所能提供之貢獻，僅能包括美洲國家發展需要的一小部份，是故美洲各國仍需仰仗並鼓勵國內外之私人投資。假定人類基本權利及自由在歐洲遭受侵犯，則新世界亦將同樣增加其不安。此事與貴國之關係，與其對美國之關係，亦同樣深切。』拉丁美洲各國代表，聽到了馬歇爾「歐洲第一」的論調，能够表示滿意的，恐怕十不得一吧！</p>
<p>展望泛美會議的前途，雖然可以順利進行，尤其是對於美國的反共政策，必能獲得大多數國家的同情，因爲在拉丁美洲國家對於美蘇關係，一直是贊成美國强硬對付蘇聯的，所謂「攘外必先安內」，馬歇爾負此使命而來，要求西半球各國的加强團結，實行聯防，一致對外，自然不會辱命的；但是在大會的過程中，仍不免引起意外的波折。因爲在「歐洲第一」的原則之下，泛美各國如不能獲得美國鉅大的經濟援助，則不論在感情上或在事實上，對於美國所要求的軍事合作，終不免表示淡漢。這是泛美會議唯一的暗礁，馬歇爾是否能不觸及暗礁，而使泛美會議圓滿結束，那就要看馬歇爾是否能不堅持成見專作自私的打算而定了。</p>

<h3>無爲而治的總統競選人　居正一席話</h3>
<p>〔本報南京二日航訊〕當副總統競選的熱浪瀰漫首都的時候，司法院畏居正以異常突起的方式宣佈競選大總統，無疑是競選高潮中別開生面的一幕。——誰不認爲大總統是捨蔣主席莫屬呢？但當蔣主席還沒有公開宣稱競選總統時，居正院長却在蔣主席之先宣佈競選總統了。</p>
<p>參加陪選</p>
<p>倡導民主風氣</p>
<p>首先宣佈競選總統的居正院長、地並沒有想和一將主席爭總統的意思，反云當他宣佈競選總統的時候，他不但一再的强調總統以蔣主席爲最適合，而且更一再的表示希望蔣主席當選。記者曾經兩次訪問過居先生，他的談話總是充滿了謙遜與禮讓，記者問他：「假如居院長當選總統後，將最先幹什麼？」居先生馬上笑着說：「不會的，不會的，總統當然是蔣主席」。他在談到競選動機時說：「我爲了接受各方友好和同志們的一再敦促，出而競選，完全是爲了倡導民主風氣，其實也可以說是陪選」。</p>
<p>簽署書上</p>
<p>絕不歌功頌德</p>
<p>擁護居院長出來競選總統　人，以湖北國大代表和各省的革命前輩以及司法界的人士爲主幹，遠在居院長還沒有表示願意競選的時候，他們就已經開始活動。其中擁護居氏最力的領袖可以何成溶爲代表，張知本，茅祖權，謝冠生等也都是從旁贊助的基本額導力量。從昨天起，他們已開始徵求國大代表的簽署提名，簽署書上並沒有什麼歌功頌德的辭句，前面只是簡單的幾句話：「茲依據國民政府卅六年三月卅一日公佈的總統副總統選舉龍免法第四條的規定，連署提出現任司法院畏居正爲總統候選人」·據說這也是居院長本人的主張，他極力避免在簽署提名時夾帶着歌功頌德的宣傳。</p>
<p>無為而治</p>
<p>含有積極意義</p>
<p>居院長平素的主張，是「無爲而治」。記者請他發表競選政見時，他總是避免談及目前政治的具體問題，有若干問題談到時，他也不希望在新聞紙上公開發表。對於「無爲而治」的解釋，他說：「無爲而治」，不是不爲，而是不輕舉妄爲。「人有不爲也，而後可以有爲」，所以「無爲而治」，表面上看似消極，實質上仍包含着積極的意義·居氏競選的是大總統，他說「無爲而治」，就是他競選的主張，大總統依憲法的規定只是國家的元首，如果實行分層負責，恪守制度，大總統做到「無爲而治」也就好了。記者反覆地詢問他當選了總統以後第一件要做什麼事，他的回答，除了謙遜着說不會當選外，總是說：做什麼事，應該是行政院長的事。同時改革政治雖然居氏不願談政見，但對於目前國家的現狀，他也深深的抱着隱憂，革命革了幾十年了，民生主義還沒有實行，目前人民的痛苦如此，居氏主張，在　前局勢下，固應以戡亂爲第一，由戡亂求安定，由安定求建設，但政治的改革也應爲當務之急·記者問他政治改革應從中央着手還是從地方着手時，居氏抱着相李宗仁氏不同的意見，他回答說：應該自地方改革入手，一如果基層政治不改革，單靠中央改革是沒有用的，建國大綱上規定各縣自治完成以後才完成省自治，可見政治的改革必須由下而上。</p>
<p>面好敦促</p>
<p>本人不作活動對於總統的競選，居氏始終主張採取「無爲而治」的辦法，除了他的友好在爲他進行競選活動外，他自己不願作任何的活動。他特別强調的對記者說：「我決不請客！也決不花錢！」就連是否要招待記者一次發表競選主張，他還是在考慮中。在爲他活動競選的朋友中，頗有人主張採取不宣傳的辦法，他們也是根據居院長的主張而做事。謝冠生曾經向居院長說；他甚至認爲記者招待會也可以不必要的　在副總統競選的熱浪中，居院長是第一位宣佈競選總統的人，居氏已經是七十三歲的高齡了，論革命功動，對於競選總統，他是應該當仁不讓的，但他一再謙遜着說：「大總統實在是捨蔣主席而莫屬！」</p>

<h3>美英法對蘇提出警告　柏林空運不得干涉　否則將被迫實施武裝護航</h3>
<p>〔路透社柏林二日電〕英美法區司令已在準衛一項照會，於二日午刻向蘇聯當局提出。其中將聲明蘇方如有統制出入柏林空中交通之任何企圖，係表示將有「射聲事件」。權威方面於透露前項消息時，並證實英方雖不擬以戰鬥機保護客機，但若蘇方拒絕三强之不得千涉空運要求，則武裝護航殆將不能避免。據云，三强之照會將聲明該照會並不具有嚴格的最後通關性質，然觀察家均不解外交辭令，如何可以掩飾該照會之眞正嚴重意義。</p>
<p>〔路透社柏林二日電〕拍林與西方佔領區目前已僅恃空路溝通，市內空氣甚爲緊張。蘇方已在各公路口派駐哨兵，携有坦克吉普等配備，阻止汽車公共汽車之通過，此外並傳蘇方軍隊調動　形忙碌。接近蘇方當局之人預料蘇方不久且將統制空中交通，惟迄至下午一時爲止，原定飛柏林之美運輸機廿二架已有九架安抵柏林。</p>
<p>〔路透社柏林二日電〕英軍方面頃證實最近英飛機飛柏林經過蘇軍區止空時，蘇戰鬥機之向其俯衝或盤旋曾發生一兩次事件，然於向蘇當局抗議時，蘇方均否認有此事件。美機飛柏林時亦曾遭遇類似事件。英方發言人鄭重否認英方已曾考慮以戰鬥機護航。</p>
<p>〔路透社柏林一日電〕蘇情報處長社巴諾夫在蘇軍區瓦萊城告德人稱，英美區大批間諜正潛入拍林，轉往蘇聯區他處，以刺探軍事政治經濟消息，蘇聯已不能再事容忍英美之「刧掠」柏林。</p>
<p>〔路透社柏林二日電〕柏林英美法蘇四强副司令今日照常舉行每週例會，但蘇聯加緊統制交通之事，並不在議程之內。又柏林之四強聯合軍政府亦仍繼續從事其正常活動。</p>
<h3>美英注視柏林事件　蘇聯加強邊界交通管制　美機空運糧食接濟軍民</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕倫敦二日廣播：蘇方加緊對柏林之封鎖，甚至鐵路運輸亦將受影響。美國軍用機廿三架已在登貝爾霍夫機場降洛，載運糧食接濟柏林美佔區居民，另有六七架不久亦將前來，此外復有美國客機五架抵達。英國載有食物之火車開過蘇佔區，僅受普通檢查，蘇方對飛機行動未予阻撓。根據種種徵象觀之，蘇方封鎖並無鬆弛可能，因在英美提出抗議之後，蘇方即宣稱，「吾人對業已決定之事，不予變更」云。</p>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓一日電〕蘇聯管制柏林與西德間交通事，此間外交官方面認此爲蘇聯企圖强迫西方國家退出柏林之開端。柏林美軍總司令克萊有權採取一切對抗行動，國務部則重申美國留在柏林決心·一部份人士認爲克萊行動，不致越出美政府旣定政策之路綫。國務與國防兩部並無驚恐之象，似希望此種嚴重爭執，能就地解決，而不致惡化至不可收拾。惟柏林久被認爲美蘇外交政策之試煉塲，危機四伏，雙方倘被逼攤牌，各與本身威望有關，尤其在此美國担保歐洲各國抵抗蘇聯擴張之時爲然。</p>
<p>〔路透社倫敦一日電〕英外交部人士對於柏林之發展，甚感憤慨，準備採取堅決立塲，惟究將採取何種行動尙未決定。蓋西方國家迄尙未獲任何法律根據，可以對付蘇聯之統制交通措施。外交部德國司之官員指出四强之書面協定，僅有關於四强佔領及共管柏林之規定，並無禁止任何一國檢查出入人員之規定。蘇聯此次舉動無疑的已遠背四强諒解精神，然西方國家如本於此點而向其交涉，其難獲效果必在意料之中。且蘇聯在柏林所採之措施，在粵國蘇軍區內早已施行，英美法前此並未表示異議，此亦西方國家未便採取强硬態度之一理由</p>
<p>〔合衆社成功湖二日電〕東西兩方在柏林之鬥爭，二日使聯合國萬分焦慮。一般恐大國在柏林攤牌，而使聯合國受到嚴重甚至不可收拾之影響。往來柏林之交通糾紛被提交安理會或聯大會之可能性幾等於零，僉信即使此問題提出，聯合國亦無能爲力。</p>
<p>〔路透社柏林二日電〕英軍用列車一列，在蘇聯佔領區邊界之馬林蓬站被阻二十小時後，已於二日淸晨折返柏林。英列車駛離馬林蓬後不久蘇當局即將柏林與蘇聯區檢查站伏爾斯費特間一百哩長之鐵路封鎖，夜間禁止通行，白畫通行須獲特許。自魯爾供應柏林之運煤軍用火車，固均取道該綫。同時據悉馬林蓬站附近德籍鐵路職員家屬十二戶，已塞蘇當局令遷出，供蘇邊界駐軍居住。馬林蓬北五哩處華爾臺克村之居民八百名，亦奉令搬令搬出，供蘇軍駐紥。又據德國新聞社訊，柏林英軍區邊際蓋多飛機塲側十字路口之一路口蘇軍所設之障礙物，已於一日夜撤除，其他三路口尙在英軍封鎖中。柏林市內自蘇聯區至他區貨運之統制，已經蘇當局於一日夜解除，惟消息靈通方面謂蘇當局將於下星期一實施更嚴峻的統制。美軍運輸機兩架，自德國美軍區載運柏林美軍人員所需糧食一萬五千磅，已於一日夜安抵柏林美軍區之丹不爾霍夫機塲。</p>
<h3>新聞會議通過　平時新聞檢查案　新聞自由原則將付表決</h3>
<p>〔路透社日內瓦一日電〕蘇聯今日正式向國際新聞自由大會建議使一切主張法西斯宣傳或任何方式的侵略者，不得享受思想及意思表示自由的權利。蘇聯係對美國所提規定新聞自由原則一項決議案提出修正。英代表台夫斯指出美國決議案內譴責一切獨佔尤其是政府性獨佔之語，其意等於禁止「英國廣播公司」，渠建議刪去前述一語，大會定二日表決，美國之決議案及英蘇之修正案。大會今日並通過和平時期之新聞檢查，除係軍事安全所需要者外，應予一律禁止。和平時期之新聞檢查，應符合六項條件，其中包括必須使記者預先知悉檢查之條件，及不得使記者蒙受非必要的遲延及耗費等，此六效係以十九對東歐之六反對票而通過。</p>
<h3>美兩院聯會決議　撤銷援西案</h3>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓一日電〕參衆兩院聯合委員會今日表決，除非西歐于六國自行邀請西班牙政府參加，否則該國下得列入馬歇爾援歐復興計劇。此項決磯距官方宣布馬歇爾完全反對西班牙被列入受援之列不足一小時。參院已拒絕邀請西班牙參加，衆院覆議時料將發生激辯，但最後大致可望接受聯合委會此項決議。委員會現正繼續討論衆院昨夜通過之六十二億零五百萬元援外總法案，設法調整兩院對於援華部份之　異議。</p>
<h3>馬歇爾要求南美國家　防共產主義泛濫　并責蘇聯威脅世界和平</h3>
<p>〔中央社波哥大一日合衆電〕馬歇爾頃譴責蘇聯使世界不能事受和平，並要求南美洲各國，對馬歇爾計劃，有所貢獻，以協助美國遏止共產主義在歐洲之泛濫。渠吿第九屆泛美會議第二次全會稱：「人類之權利及自由若在歐洲絕跡，則在新世界中，亦將成爲不保」。馬卿對所望會議應採何種遏止共產主義之行動一點，未作暗示，渠於集中討論經濟問題時，曾予南美諸國不良之消息，是即彼等不能希冀自美國獲得任何特殊援助。馬卿在預先準備之講詞外，復作憤激之語稱：美國正耗資億萬，從事軍事建設，以保衛整個西半球，抵抗顚覆性之行動。</p>

<p>〔聯合社華盛頓一日電〕衆院今日以三三九票對三票，通過三億二千四百萬元之附加軍費案，其中一億五　萬元給予原十能委會，其餘爲佔領軍軍費及阿拉斯加軍用公路建築費。該案已送往參院討論。</p>

<h3>陳納德將軍論美國對華</h3>
<p>政策克里浦斯霍華特系報業聯合會版權所有</p>
<p>本報編譯室譯</p>
<p>（七）我與史迪威的關係</p>
<p>假如我能設法加以分析的話，我和史迪威將軍三年的爭執，由於個性上的衝突者不若由於方法上的衝突來得多。他和中國中央政府的爭執，則兩者兼而有之。</p>
<p>我知道史迪威將軍在他屬員的通知之下，以爲我使中國人反對他。這是不足爲奇的。要一個上級長官相信他之不爲人家所愛好乃是由於他自己，這是一件不大容易的事情。</p>
<p>但是我確信他和中國領袖相處的能熊度和方法，乃是他的失敗以及中美戰時合作關係在一九四二—四四年間失調的主要因素。</p>
<p>從一開始起，史迪威將軍，從來不大隱瞞對於我以及對於和他相處的中國領袖們的不喜，因此要我像一個朋友一般地對待他，也就不容易了。</p>
<p>我對於中日戰爭比任何其他美國人具有更長和要親切的實際認識，但是對於處理對華軍事關係的任何重要的問題，史迪威將軍從來沒有徵詢過我的意見。當我提出意見的時候，又往往輕蔑地被回絕。</p>
<p>雖然我是他的高級空軍軍官兼蔣委員長的空軍參謀長，却從沒有被召到戰區司令部去就我們的空中局勢陳述意見，直至一九四四年間魏德邁接替史迪威之後。</p>
<p>我對於在政策方面和史迪威時常意見不一這一點，並不覺得可恥，但是對於他給我的每一個命令，我總忠實地予以執行。我並不爭辯我一直是對的，史迪威一直是錯的·在我的指導之下，的確犯過錯誤，但是我相信這些錯誤，大部份是手續上的而非判斷上的。</p>
<p>我們的意見不一，從沒有到公開破裂的程度，這是我們兩人各知分寸的一種成功。猶如以後的事實所證明的，史迪咸的失敗，完全是由於他對中國人的關係以及他對處理對日戰爭的錯誤軍略抉擇。</p>
<p>在他被召回之前很久，史迪威將軍一直禁止我舉行記者招待會，雖然我是第十四航空隊的司令官，司令設於昆明。重慶戰區司令部認爲唯有戰區司令可以在記者招待會上會晤新聞記者，雖然事實上，在大部份戰爭期間中，第十四航空隊乃是美國在華唯一的作戰部隊，因此對於美國大衆是具有極大興趣的。　戰區司令部的規定以及戰地特派員相反的堅決要求，迫使我採取了一種可笑的變通辦法，就是「集體接見新聞記者」，而不是舉行記者招待會。唯一的不同之點，就是特派員在所發的消息中不說「記者招待會」而說「會晤」。這絲毫的區別似乎使一切有關的人都感覺滿意，包括戰區司令在內。</p>
<p>在一九四五年間，當我擔任空軍司令的任務將告結束之時，有一點成爲很明顯，那就是縱使史迪威離開中國已將一年，他對我的判斷在華盛頓方面依然很有力量，於我不利。在我擔任司令期間，我一直是負責官員隨便流傳的惡意謠言和雜談的目標。我恐怕高級方面一定很相信，而並爲顧到事實眞相。</p>
<p>在一九四五年，我被人指責未能與史迪威將軍合作，但是使美國在華所作努力朱致完全一蹶不振者，却正是史迪威有時認爲是危險而討論的第十四航空隊，猶如我將在這些回憶中加以指出的</p>
<p>一九四五年間在中國方面的空戰獲勝而離確認此種成就尙遠之時，華盛頓在重慶成立了、一個高級空軍司令部。或許不是在表面上而是在實際上，我認爲此一行動係對我而發。</p>
<p>我於一九三七年到中國來，因爲我是被邀來創辦中國空軍的。我一直留在中國，因爲我想帮助中國擊敗日本，那時　開珍珠港事變尙有四年。</p>
<p>在珍珠港事變之後，我恢復復役美國陸軍，因爲我相　有更大的工作應該要做的。</p>
<p>一九四五年七月，我對美國與中國在戰爭上的效用已告完畢，所以我再度從美國陸軍中退休·我在退休之時心中不無若干失望，但是依然堅決相信史迪威是一個優秀的戰地司令——美國所曾產生過的最好的師長之一。</p>

<h3>不愉快的雷諾下塲　悄然飛云復來　探險專機被扣　我政府將向美大使正式提抗議</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕雷諾宣佈放素探險計劇後，中央研究院院長朱家　及該院物理研究所所長　本棟，昨晨聯名致電本市民航局辦事處，扣留其探險號專機，不料雷諾偕其機師奧登，副機師　利，無綫電風李爾等四人，於前日下午自平駕受損之探險號專機扺滬後，昨晨三時，竟自彼等居住之勵志社招待所悄然起身，驅車前往龍華機塲，於六時許起飛離滬，迨民航局發覺，已不及阻止，後用無綫電囑其返滬，但該機置之不理，而直飛印度加爾各答，民航局遂即將該機「脫逃」情形電吿南京方面。不料至昨晚九時許，此「探險號」專機，忽又飛回龍華機塲，其原因據悉係事先未與印度方面取得聯絡，故加爾各答機塲不准其降落，乃不得不飛回上海。民航局上海辦事處見該機重行飛返，實出望外，乃即予以扣留。至雷諾本人，經此一番「不榮譽」之徒勞往返後，昨晚未至勵志社招待所寄宿，而下榻華懋飯店，據其自稱，將於今晨赴京，向當局有所解釋。　按雷諾探險計劃，始於本年一月中，其本人兩度來華，僕僕京滬之間，與我政府當局及中央研究院接洽之下，正式成立探險團，由中美雙方各派科學家參加。上月七日，其自置之探險號專機自美來華，不料抵滬之後，油箱即吿漏油，又飛回美國修理，至上月二十六日，該機二度來華抵滬，一般人皆以爲探險工作，即可順利展開，中美科學家亦均先赴蘭州等候。不料該機於二十八日自滬起飛，原定路綫係循漢口至蘭州，但臨時聲稱漢口下雨，未經我民航局同意，即擅行改綫飛往北平，三十一日自平起飛時，忽然右輪傾側，以致一架螺旋槳損壞，雷諾當時即表示灰心，宣佈取消探險之舉。該受損飛機則經修理之後，於前日下午遽行飛滬，事先亦未與我民航局聯絡。當抵滬之後，民航局上海辦事處囑雷諾補辦手續，並詢其在滬有多少時間逗留，雷諾稱至少需兩三日修理，不料竟在昨日天未破曉之時，悄然飛去，而又終於在深晚不得不飛回。此一全國甚至全世界注目之積石山探險計劃，經一再挫折遲延之後，在不愉快的狀態下正式吿吹。</p>
<p>朱家驊薩本棟昨晨之來電內容稱：「上海民用航空局，請通知　華機塲，雷諾飛機朱辦妥結東手續前，不得離華。」現該機旣仍折回，雷諾當須傷一番腦筋，辦理結束手續，而不能「一走了之」矣。至業已赴蘭之中美科學家高士威與羅斯，已於昨日離蘭飛京滬返美，其餘亦將束裝而歸，神秘之安尼馬靑山對於世人將仍爲一神秘之謎而已</p>
<p>〔又訊〕據美聯社南京消息稱：薩本棟氏曾發表書面談話，指責雷諾破壞中美雙方關於積石山探險之協定。政府當局並將向美大使司徒雷登提出正式抗議。</p>
<p>「在中國賑目未清到芝加哥來收取」</p>
<p>記者昨日深晚訪雷諾於華懋飯店，詢其忽忽離滬之動機，當諾稱：「外傳中國政府因本人在華賬目未淸而將本人飛機扣留，但本人以往在世界各地銀錢往來極多，有一時未淸者，無不送到芝加哥來料理。如此次在中國賬目未淸，亦儘可送到芝加哥來收取，」又稱：「今日飛往加爾各答，並非係該處機塲不准降落，乃因途中想及護照未辦妥，故而仍飛回上海」云云。</p>

<h3>海關加強　查緝走私　沒收之外並須科刑</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕江海關根據最近頒佈之懲治走私條例，於本月一日起加强緝私工作，除原有緝私人員外，並於即日起加派海關警察常駐輪埠機塲，協助執行任務，海關並在各輪埠機塲顯要地位張貼佈吿，略謂：如有僞報，朦運，夾帶，頂替，隱匿，倫卸等情，即作走私論，除走私品沒收外，拘送法院究辦。據江海關負責查緝當局表示：以前普通走私案件不涉司法，照關章僅將走私品沒收，對走私犯無處徒刑之規定，現立法院通過懲治走私條例，對走私者始有治罪之規定，今後海關查獲走私案件，除其走私品仍由海關沒收外，走私人犯將由海關移送地方法院，按司法程序審判。旅客或因不諳關章誤帶少量違章物品，則海關除處分其物品外，不擬移送法院，因此種案件普遍而中衆多，事實上無法逐一經過司法審理，但何種情形需作走私論，何種情形可不作走私論，其標準甚難區別，若無確切規定，日後難免滋生流弊，現海關當局對此問題正週詳考慮中。</p>

<h3>唐中宗時的十道巡察使</h3>
<p>— 唐蘭</p>
<p>唐書中宗紀在神籠二年有：</p>
<p>二月乙未，刑部尙書韋巨源同中書門下三品。遺十使巡察風俗。</p>
<p>這段記載，在新唐書中宗紀裏略有不同。悅成『丙申，遺子道巡察使』。在文獻通考卷六十一巡察按察巡撫等使條下說：</p>
<p>神龍二年敕左右黨內外五品以上官，瞰理通明，無屈撓者二十人，分爲十道巡察使，二周年一替，以廉按州郡。</p>
<p>就比較詳細一些。</p>
<p>唐時巡察使的制度，大概起原於太宗貞觀八年，資治通鑑卷一百九十四說：</p>
<p>上欲分遺大臣爲諸道黜陟大使，未得其人。李靖薦魏微。上曰：「徵箴規朕失，不可一日離左右」。乃命靖與太常卿蕭瑀等凡十三人分行天下，察長史賢不肖，問民間疾舌，禮高年，賑窮乏，褒善良，起滯淹，俾使者所至，如朕親覩。</p>
<p>舊唐書太宗本紀詐祖紀出這十三個人，只說「使于四方，觀省風俗」。文獻通考卷六十一在黜陟使條下說：「貞觀八年，發十八道黜陟大使」，只是這一事，說「十八道』，恐怕是錯的。黜陟使其實就是巡察使，唐人往往混稱。不過那時只有十道，所以又簡稱爲『十道使』，如新唐書蘇　傳『請罷十道使』，而貞觀八年派了十三個人，不知是怎樣分配的。</p>
<p>神龍時的十道巡察使，通鑑卷二百八說：</p>
<p>選左右　及內外五品以上官二十人爲十道巡察使，察吏撫人，薦賢直獄，二年一代，考其功罪而進退之。易州刾史魏人姜師度，禮部員外郞馬懷素，殿中侍御吏臨漳源乾曙，監察御史靈昌盧懷愼，衛尉少卿滏陽李傑，皆預焉。　舊唐書馬懷素傳　說：</p>
<p>累轉禮部員外郞，與源乾曜盧懷愼李傑等，充十道黜陟使。</p>
<p>只沒有提到姜師度。但就照通鑑所說，也只指出了五人。近來讀唐史，又考出了幾個人，一併記在下面。</p>
<p>一·姜師度新唐書本傳說：</p>
<p>河北道巡察兼度支營由使。</p>
<p>又蕭嵩傳說：</p>
<p>河北黜陟使姜師度表爲判官。</p>
<p>二·馬懷素新唐書本傳說：</p>
<p>轉禮部員外郞，以十道使黜陟江西。</p>
<p>三·源乾曜新唐書本傳說：</p>
<p>神龍中以殿中侍御史黜陟江東。</p>
<p>四：慮懷愼新唐書本傳只說他『神龍中，遷侍御史，……遷右御史臺中丞』，他可能用中丞的身份出使，但不知他到什麼地方。</p>
<p>五·李傑新唐書本傳說。</p>
<p>神龍中爲河束巡察黜陟使。</p>
<p>六，倪若水新唐書本傳說：</p>
<p>擢進士第，累遷右臺監察御史，黜陟劍南道。</p>
<p>七·盧從愿新唐書本傳說：</p>
<p>遷監察御史，爲山南黜陟巡撫使。</p>
<p>八·侯令德新唐書李尙隱傳說：</p>
<p>神龍中左臺中丞侯令德爲關內黜陟使，尙隱佐之，以最，擢左臺監察御史。</p>
<p>九·路敬潛新唐書李素立傳說：</p>
<p>黜陟使路敬潛薦其淸白。</p>
<p>又舊唐書尹思貞傳說：</p>
<p>神龍初爲大理卿，……出爲靑州刾史，……黜陟使衛州司馬路敬潛八月到州。</p>
<p>又金石萃編卷六十八盧公清魏文說：</p>
<p>神龍元年，……改榮陽縣令，……河南道巡察傳衛州司馬路敬潛以政術尤異奏聞。</p>
<p>這裏一共九個人，所到的地方有：河北，江西，江東，河東，劍南，山南，關內，河南，共八處，只有盧懷愼的地方還不知道。</p>
<p>害初的十道，本是：</p>
<p>一曰關內，二曰河南，三曰河東，四曰河北，五曰山南，六曰隴右，七曰淮南，八曰江南，九曰劍南，十曰嶺南。</p>
<p>見地理志。神龍時的巡察黜陟使却有了江東和江西，這是狠可怪的。</p>
<p>故宮博物院去年影印的宋濂跋本五仁昫切嶺序說：</p>
<p>大唐龍興，廉問寓縣，有江東道巡察黜陟大使平侯嗣先者，燕國鼎族，京兆冠蓋。</p>
<p>我寫跋文的時候，因爲唐時無江東道，就說『東蓋南字之誤』，又因爲項跋本作『江東南道』，疑惑他是『江南東道之誤』。現在知道不僅有江東，幷且還有江西，可見讀古書沒有把證據搜齊，是不應該輕易下判斷的。</p>
<p>『平侯嗣先』的平，恐怕是姓，他是江東道巡察黜陟大使，但據上文所引新唐書，却說源乾曜黜陟江東，那末，江東道至少就有二個　陟使了。我疑心這個大使的大字是有些關係的。照資治通鑑和文獻通考所說，那時的使臣是要五品以上官，但源乾曜的本官殿中侍御史，據百官志只是從七品下，而左臺中丞侯令德做關內黜陟使，却是以正四品下的中丞身份充任的。所以平嗣先的品位可能較高而是大使，源乾曜是他的佐，正合李尙隱是侯令德的佐一樣。新唐盡宋務光傳在神龍元年大水上書後說：</p>
<p>俄以監察御史巡察河南道。</p>
<p>可見河南道也有路敬潛宋務光兩人。那末，神龍時的二十人，除了前引九人外，還可以加上平嗣先李尙隱宋務光三人，就可以考出十二人了。</p>
<p>新害書席豫傳說：</p>
<p>凡四以使者，按　行江南，江東，淮　南，河北。似乎江東和江南不同。那末，神龍時雖說『十道使』，實際上還分出江東江西等道，在貞觀時所定十道之外，我想和貞觀八年的遺使十三人也許有些關係，這就希望再有別的新證據了。</p>
<h3>李覲與孟子</h3>
<p>— 漆俠</p>
<p>北宋一代，江南西路的學士大夫們，如歐陽修，李覯，和王安石諸人，均從典章制度方面着眼，先後對於當時的政治提出一些改革的主張。這些人旣生於同時同地，其學術思想和政治見解，自極易互相受到一些影響。胡適之先生於二十年前寫過一篇論李覯思想的文章，其中曾提及此事，特別說到王安石所行的新法，有許多是和李觀的主張，極相符合的，則其間必有一點源流關係。</p>
<p>但在他們的思想見解之間，也有不盡相同之處。例如李王二人對於孟子和佛敎的態度，便有很大的差別。</p>
<p>王安石和當時的僧人頗有往還，在他的集子裏現尙存有示安大師，示寳覺，與僧道昇等詩，不下三四十首之多，他沒有一篇痛斥佛敎的文字，而暮年閑居金陵，遨遊山水，不但與僧人的交往更爲頻繁，並且把自己所居園屋改爲僧寺，一部份私田也捐給了蔣山的太平興國寺。而在李覯的集子裏，抨擊佛敎的文章刦隨處可見，他說佛敎徒「廣占良田利宅，溫衣飽食，坐談空虛，以誑耀愚信。」又說他們「不在四民之列」，又說他們「無父無君，兼楊墨之惡，」應當嚴加禁止。道和王安石眞是大異其趣了。</p>
<p>王安石對於孟子是備極推崇的。單從他的詩中便可找出好些例證：如他酬答歐陽修詩中有云：「他日若能窺孟子，終身何敢望韓公。」又特別以「孟子」爲題而做了一首絕句云：「沉魄浮魂不可招，遺編一讀望風標。何妨舉世嫌迂闊，故有斯人慰寂廖。」」而李覯呢，却是一個人所共知的「不喜孟子」的人。</p>
<p>自北宋以來，便有許多人在文字中記載李覯「不喜孟子」的事。王稱的東都事略一一四李覯傳云：</p>
<p>素不喜孟子，以爲孔子尊王，孟子敎諸侯爲王。嘗試制科，六論不得其一，曰：「吾書未嘗不讀，必孟子注疏也。」擲筆而出，人爲檢視之，果然。終不中第。晁公武的郡齋讀書志，在李氏的「吁江集」下也記此事，而且文字幾乎和東都事略全同。文云：</p>
<p>覯盱江人。嘗試制科，六論不得其一，曰：「吾書未嘗不讀，此必孟子註疏也。」擲而出，人爲檢視之，果然。遂下第而歸。陳振孫的直齋書錄解題中也記此事：</p>
<p>泰伯不喜孟子，常語專辯之。嘗舉茂材不中，世傳閣試論題有全不記所出者，曰：「此必孟子注也。」擲筆而出。</p>
<p>又在羅大經的鶴林玉露中也記此事：</p>
<p>李泰伯著常語非孟子，後舉茂材，論題出「經正則庶民興」不知出處，曰：「吾無書不讀，此必孟子中語也。」擲而出。而在不知撰人的道山淸話中，更記有一段特別有趣的故事：</p>
<p>李覯字泰伯，盱江人。賢而有文章，　十瞻諸公極推重之。素不喜佛，不喜孟子；好飮酒，作文；古文彌佳。一日，有達官送酒數斗，泰伯家釀亦熟。然性介僻，不與人往還。一士人知其當有酒，然無計得飲，乃作詩數目駡孟子，其一云：「完廩捐階未可知，孟軻灤信亦還痴；丈人尙自爲天子，女婿如何弟殺之。」李見詩大喜，留連數日，所與談莫非駡孟子也。無何，酒盡，乃辭去。旣而又有寄酒者，士人聞之，再住，作仁義正論三篇，大率皆詆釋氏。李覽之笑云：「公文采甚奇。但前次被公喫了酒，後極索寞；今次不敢相留，留此酒以自遺懷。」聞者莫不絕倒。</p>
<p>李氏反對孟子的故事旣然流傳甚廣，其眞實性當是無可疑的。就李氏自著的「常語」當中，也可以看出他反對孟子的激烈程度。「常語」有一條說：</p>
<p>……如何曰「孔子死不得其傳矣」？彼孟子者，名學孔子而實背之者矣，焉得傳？敢問何謂也？孔子之道，君君臣臣也；孟子之道，人皆可以爲君也。天下無王，覇言僞而辯老不殺，諸子得以行其意。孫吳之智，蘇張之詐，孟子之仁義，其原不同，其所以亂天下一也。又有一條說：</p>
<p>孟子曰：「五覇，三王之罪人也。」吾以爲孟子者，五覇之罪人也。五覇率諸侯事　　，苟有人性者，必知其逆順耳矣。孟子當周顯王時，其後尙百年而秦幷之，嗚呼！忍人焉，其視周室如無有也散見於其他諸條的也還有不少的貶斥孟子的話，例如：</p>
<p>「孟子自以爲好仁，吾知其不仁甚矣。」</p>
<p>「信孟子而不信經，是猶信他人而不信父母也。</p>
<p>「吾以為天下無孟子可也，不可無六經。」</p>
<p>對於孟子的理論及其爲人，都如此加以非難，這眞如余允文在「尊孟辯」的序中所說：「非之而近於底」了。</p>
<p>以上所引李氏常語中的話語，不見於現時行世的李氏文集當中，我是從尊孟辯中轉引來的。今本李集所以不見這幾段文宇之故，淸代四庫館臣以爲是被後代編輯此集的人刪除掉的，四庫總目別集六盱江集提要有云：</p>
<p>考覯年譜稱：慶曆三年癸未集退居類稿十二卷，又皇祐四年庚辰集皇祐續稿八卷』此集爲明南城左贊所編，凡詩文雜著三十七卷，前列年譜一卷，後以制誥薦章之類爲外集三卷，蓋非當日之舊。宋人多稱覯不喜孟子，余允文尊孟辯中載覯常語十七條，而此集所載僅仲尼之徒無道桓文之事，及伊尹廢太甲，周公封魯三條，蓋贊諱而刪之。集首載祖無擇退居類稿序，特以孟子比覯；又集中答李觀書云：「孟氏荀楊醇疵之說，不可復輕重」；其他文中亦頗引及孟子，與宋人所記種種相反，以所刪常語推之，毋亦贊所竄亂歟？</p>
<p>（未完）</p>
<h3>楊貴妃入道之年</h3>
<p>— 陳垣</p>
<p>唐大詔令集四十有關於楊妃事文書三道：</p>
<p>一，册楊玄　女爲壽王妃文。開元廿三年乙亥十二月廿四日。</p>
<p>一，册韋昭訓女爲壽王妃文。天寳四載乙西七月廿六日。</p>
<p>一，度壽王妃楊氏爲女道士士。年月底，當在開元廿九年正月二日。</p>
<p>朱竹垞　書事集五五有「書楊太眞外傳後」，謂妃以處子入宮，其解釋廿三年册文，據開元禮，謂親王納妃，由納采問名，納吉納徵，請期親迎，動需卜日，無納采受册即歸壽邸之禮。</p>
<p>今考通典一二九關元體，親王納妃，受册在請期之後，親迎之前，是受册後即親迎，不得據此謂妃未歸壽邸也。</p>
<p>其解釋入道勃文，因文中有「屬太后忌辰」句，謂太后爲玄宗生母昭成寶后以長壽二年正月二日受書，則天以建子月爲歲首，據　會要廿三，永處元年方改正以十一月二日爲忌，開元中猶循舊，則妃入道之期當在正月二日。其說甚精。</p>
<p>然以爲在開元廿五年正月，則其時玄宗武惠把尙未薨。武惠妃之薨在開元廿五十二月丙午。舊絕九，新紀五，通鑑二一四皆同。害會要三作十二月七日，七日即丙午，是月庚子朔也。</p>
<p>舊五一惠妃傳及舊一〇七壽王傳，亦作廿五年。惟舊楊妃傳作廿四年惠妃薨，新楊妃傳因之，乃刪惠妃傳之薨年，以期畫一。而不知本紀仍作廿五年。此紀傳不出一人手之故。</p>
<p>竹垞乃依楊妃傳之說，推楊妃入道在開元廿五年，實失之過早。且果未歸壽邸，則太后忌辰與未婚之妃何涉？此不得曲爲廻護者也。</p>
<p>章實齋遺書外編三，丙辰剳記，則與竹垞之說相反，謂開元廿三年册塲氏爲壽王妃，妃生方十七年，天寳四年有度壽王妃楊氏入道勑文，則楊氏入壽邸邸已十年矣。</p>
<p>不知入道勑文本無年月，實齋何所據以爲天寶四載？殊嫌武斷。其意以入道人富與册爲貴妃，皆在一年，不知度爲道士與册爲貴妃，用意不同。未册貴妃之前儘可先入宮，未離壽邸之前不可以納諸宮中也。度爲道士，在使之正式脫離壽邸關係耳。自廿五年惠妃薨後，帝求當意之人甚急，旣發見有當意之人，豈能待至天寳四載之久？故實齋推楊妃入道之年，又失之過晚。</p>
<p>然則楊妃入道究在何年？曰，楊妃入道年月，新紀於開元二十八年十月甲子幸溫泉宮條下即接書「以壽王妃楊氏爲道士，號太眞」，以舊紀校之，知此條爲新紀所增，通鑑亦未之載也。新紀何所據，據太眞外傳耳。</p>
<p>外傳云：開元廿二年十一月歸壽邸，廿八年十月玄宗幸溫泉宮，使高力士取楊氏女於壽邸，度爲女道士，號太眞。竹垞以此爲傳聞之　，蓋不信已歸壽邸之說耳。</p>
<p>樂史見宋史三〇六，生北宋初，其言當有所據。廿二年十一月者，今本外傳字之訛，有冊文年月甲子可證。然取楊氏女於壽邸，與度爲女道士，未必同時，據入道勅文，明謂因太后忌辰求度，則度爲女道士，當在翌年之正月二日。新紀旣取外傳，當繫其事於廿九年正月，不當擊其事於廿八年十月也。</p>
<p>自由談</p>
<h3>三月底過去了</h3>
<p>— 平齋</p>
<p>今夭是四月一日，我特地把本報的本埠新聞仔細地看了一遍，看得比平日特別留心。爲什麼呢？因爲四月一日的報紙是刊載三月三十一日所發生的事情的，而我對於滬三月底的一天發生了特殊的興趣。</p>
<p>三月底不就是上海一半的舞廳必須停業的限期麼？</p>
<p>然而，四月一日的報紙上就沒有道些舞應停業的新聞。我並不覺得意外；相反的，我反覺得舞廳如果眞的如期停業，倒是出了大冷門。</p>
<p>上海的市參議員中有幾位是我天天見面的熟人，因之我在最近一次市參議會開會的時候，我偶然開了無綫電收聽參議會開會的情形，本來是想聽聽我認識的幾位參議員先生的言論的，然而一開却聽見了關於禁舞問題的討論，而且是社會局局長吳開先先生的發言。他那天說的話有許多我現在已經記不淸楚，不過有幾句話却使我印象特別深，所以我到現在還記得很淸楚，因爲從這幾句話中，我已經預料到四月一日的報紙上未必會有「中籤舞塲休業」的消息了。他說：「本人的態度是：如果中央到了限期並不催辦這件事情，本人就決不自動的執行。」那時的參議員中很有幾位的態度頗爲激昂，他們因爲參議會先已議決過反對禁舞，而政府不予理睬，所以有一個措辭很不客氣的新提案。對於這個提案，吳局長又勸吿說：「請各位不要太刺激中央……」平心而論，吳局長那天的語氣雖然微嫌過份緊張了一點，却實在是相當誠摯，而他的話也的確多少還是顧全了大體的。</p>
<p>也許，堂而皇之的禁舞令就此算數了罷？倒楣的是社會局的那些門窗茶杯桌子椅子。</p>
<p>我從不跳舞，但也決不反對別人跳舞——而我絕對堅決地反對禁舞。我認爲舞業旣是合法的營業，那麼政府的禁舞便是不對。其次，我認爲從禁舞中所能收到的節約的效果不大，而造成的失業問題却十分嚴重。這次舞業從業員搗毀社會局事件，固然也許有少數野心份子企圖造成「慘案」，但在安定山播下了不安定的種子，使這些野心份子能够有所藉口的，正就是忽發奇想要禁止跳舞的袞袞諸公！</p>
<p>爽性剛愎自用到底的人們，表倒也很佩服，因爲至少他們說一是一，令出必行，尙有效率與威信可言。但在民主國家裏面，則無論如何不能對人民們的公意一筑抹煞。我們個人處世辦事，要講究「拿得起，放得下」，要講究「過則勿憚改」，政府何嘗不然？羅斯福在戰時都曾屢次碰過議會的釘子，民意不要他這樣做，他就祗能接受。我們的袞袞諸公旣然似乎並無令催上海社會局執行禁舞的勇氣——然則何妨痛痛快快地取消了禁舞令，多少還博得了一個尊重民意的美名？</p>
<p>先是三令五申的要禁舞，對民意機關的申述完全置之不理，等到弄出事情來，又不敢眞的蠻幹到底了，可是又不好意思當衆承認自己本來有些無聊，於是在窮思極想之餘，總算想出了一個「眼開眼閉」之策，而地方政府則以「假痴假呆」應之——我們老百姓於欣賞之餘，實在覺得又氣又好笑！</p>
<h3>江蘇得水多</h3>
<p>— 弘賢</p>
<p>江蘇省的省名便有個江字，省內有很多的江河湖泊，省界又東臨大海，省內的縣名而多水而得名，歸納之可分四類：</p>
<p>（一）直接間接因海而定名的縣份，有東海，海門，海安，上海等四縣。</p>
<p>（二）直接間接因江河而定名的縣份，有松江，吳江，江陰，鎭江，江寗，江浦，淮陰，淮安，靖江，溧水，溧陽，江都，漣水，泗陽，沭陽等十五縣。</p>
<p>（三）直接間接因湖泊而定名縣份，有寳應，高郵等二縣。</p>
<p>（四）其他與水有關縣份，還有沛縣，灌雲，鹽城，揚中，高淳，靑浦，南匯，川沙等八縣。</p>
<p>以上四類共有廿九縣，已差不多佔了江蘇縣份的一半。</p>
<h3>中年況味</h3>
<p>— 霜廬</p>
<p>古人云：人生如白駒渦隙，但依我個人的經驗來說，這也許只適用於從少年到山年這一階段。靑年時代，反正用老子的錢，只覺得有過不完的好日子。少年時代，還是獨身者，賺來的錢，儘够自己化，結了婚，也還沒有孩子，日子還過得去，儘有一點餘的來從事幻想。人還有幻想的餘裕，便決不會覺得日子難渦的。只是現在時入中年，迫於現實生活的如影隨形，整天打算油鹽柴米之計，旣沒有思索的餘地，更沒有規避的餘地，不知不覺一年年如水而去。</p>
<p>偶然碰到個把中學裏的同學，大家都是額上多皺紋，顎下已　　的了。逢到一二個可親的少女，你滿以爲可以交朋友的，她們却已把你看成上一輩，叔叔伯伯的亂呌了，你還有跟她們做朋友的勇氣嗎？趕熱鬧的興緻减却，寗可靜下來翻翻舊書。看童星秀蘭鄧波兒的影片尙在眼前，可是報上說，秀蘭鄧波兒不但已經結了婚，而且是一個孩子的母親了。在這一些小節上，你會驚異於時間的倐忽，平空覺悟到自己已入中年。然年輕時候的事則還歷歷在目，想到古人白駒過隙的比喻，安能不喟然興嘆！</p>
<p>像我們這樣三十多歲的人，以「人生七十古來稀」而論，似乎在人生的旅途上已走下坡路，靑年時也曾立過大志，有過野心，現在才知道自己並不是這麼一塊材料，還有現實的條件也使你違　不來，仔細忖之，乃頗有所謂「定命的悲哀」。人生如探險，歷盡艱辛是靠着未來的憧憬的，現在已可約略忖得旅途的盡頭，這探險也就沒有什麼意義了，其能不廢然而返者幾希？</p>
<p>不過中年也有中年的好處，從前讀過的書，往往不求甚解，或不能甚解，現在知識一多，便能自然而然迎刃而解，或較少年時代能更進一步的認識。這不能不說是年事稍長的益處。</p>
<p>人情練達，大概也是中年的事，不到火候是不能純熟的。靑年時代輕易信人，易動感情，說話不留餘地，好臧否人物，結果自然是自己吃虧，現在想想，這簡直是獃子幹的。但往者已矣，今後總不致再蹈覆轍了，想到這裘，亦有許多安慰。</p>
<p>年齡稍爲大一點，看見的也多一點，聽見的也多一點，親身嘗到的也多一點，人生原不過是看人做戲，和做戲給人看，逢人談戲，居然能如數家珍，或是生旦凈丑自己都曾扮演過，豈非一快？</p>
<p>凡此皆中年之益，於哀之之外可以樂者也。</p>
<p>西人有「人生始於四十」之語，此言甚是，做夢做着好夢固然可喜，做着惡夢，至少可以領會一些做夢的滋味。如果四十以前做的夢不太好，那末何妨從四十開始，再做一塲呢？如能參透此中道理，則人生始於四十固可，始於五十六十亦何嘗不可？能不作最惡的想法，多少把握一點現實的佳境，大概便是達人，而且也近乎神仙了。</p>
<h3>遺囑</h3>
<p>— 李梨</p>
<p>十九世紀加拿大的鄧洛甫於臨死時立了個遺囑：</p>
<p>遺贈五畝田地給大姊瓊，以資安慰她嫁給一個「懾於蘭威」的丈夫。</p>
<p>—該地邊緣的小屋，給予二姊莎莉，看樣子，不致會有人娶她，這座小屋已足够她一人應用了。</p>
<p>—我的大本聖經，給予三姊凱蒂，她可以從這些她所認識的字中，去學習成爲一個好人。</p>
<p>—大銀欽一只，給予弟弟詹姆，以後，他可以知道什麼時候應該起床。</p>
<p>—最好的烟斗一只，給予妹夫克利斯多夫，表示感謝他娶了我的任何懂風情的男人都搖頭的妹妹美吉。</p>
<h3>車的啟示</h3>
<p>— 翼君</p>
<p>在一本敎育測驗書上看到有這麼一句話：「對於居住城市的四五歲兒童，「汽車與電車誰走得快」一試題，或者是一個有效的智力測驗，對於鄉村兒童就不適用了。我這個廿四五歲的城市成人對於這個試題，竟也答不出，其笨可知。這是前年夏天的事。但從那時起，我便常常留心：究竟電車快呢？汽車快？</p>
<p>經過將二年的觀察，發覺最多的時候，總是汽車如射箭一般的越過電車的，只有最少的時候，電車才顯出駛得快些。</p>
<p>於是乎，進一步，我又研究其原因。原來電車是有軌道的，（無軌電車輪下雖無軌，頂上還是離不開電綫的，等於有軌。）所以行動起來，一遇前面車馬塞途，本身又爲軌道所限，不能自由進越，只好慢駛，至於停下來，此其一；縱使前面人車稀少，毫無障碍，駛得太快，又有出軌翻車的危險，快不得，此其二。汽車呢？旣無軌道限制，便有充分的自由，此處不通，便往彼處，橫衝直撞，隨機所欲，自然快了。但是，電車慢是慢了，關禍的時候可就少些，汽車快是快了，肇事的機會可就多些。</p>
<p>因此，我得到一個啓示二不自由，妨碍本身的進展；放縱的自由，又易侵害他人的安全，我們應該爭取的自由是，不妨害他人的充分個人自由。只有這樣的自由才够得上說：「生命誠可貴，愛情價更高，若爲自由故，兩者皆可拋。」</p>
<h3>可怕的適應</h3>
<p>— 葉公</p>
<p>我們人是最善於適應的。先說眼睛，當我們剛從光天化日下走入黑漆漆的電影院時，雙目失明，什麼也看不見，過了一會兒，視覺恢復，能見到你左右前後的芳隣，是個鬚眉畢現的男子，抑是俊美的妙齡女郞了。眼睛已適應了黑暗。</p>
<p>次說耳朶，當我們剛從幽靜冷僻的鄉村搬到車馬喧囂的城市來住時，實在煩躁不安，但是幾天以後，也就充耳不聞，行所無事了。耳朶已適應了嘈雜。</p>
<p>三說鼻子，當我們初進入鮑魚之肆時，那種腥臭的氣息，令人作嘔，但奇怪的是久而不聞其臭。鼻子已適應了腐臭。、四說嘴巴，當我們第一次說謊或是說出卑鄙下流的話時，面紅耳赤，期期艾艾，而幾次以後，你便會以說葉爲藝術，駡人爲才幹了。嘴巴已適應了欺騙與咀咒。</p>
<p>五說兩手，當我們第一次拿刀殺人時，手會軟，膽會怯，一等人殺多了，不殺人反而不好過了。兩手已適應了血肉糢糊的殘忍。</p>
<p>六說良心，當我們第一次起邪惡之念時，總不免戰戰兢兢，若有所失，但是啊，久而久之，「寗願我負天下人，不願天下人負我」的人生觀形成了。良心已適應了狠毒。</p>
<p>啊，可怕的適應！</p>
<h3>空氣的阻力</h3>
<p>— 孺子</p>
<p>德國的哲學家康德有一次說：在空中飛翔的鴿子，其所必須克服的困難，就是空氣的阻力。無知的鴿子，也許以爲把空氣抽去，飛起來就會快一點舒服一點的吧。不知如果眞的把空氣抽掉，讓鴿子在眞空中飛，鴿子馬上就會掉在地上，飛也飛不起了。空氣是鴿子飛行的阻力，但是沒有空氣的阻力，鴿子也就不能飛了。——由此可見，沒有磨難，沒有阻碍，沒有困難，必不能完成偉業。</p>
<h3>平凡中的神奇</h3>
<p>— 冷冷</p>
<p>法國大畫家克蒂門勒時常帶了食盒畫具畫布等在破曉的時候出發到郊外去，他坐在草堆前—一個田野間極平常的草堆前，拿出他的畫具來開始作畫。從早晨起一張一張地畫下去，直到天色暗了，才收拾回去。一天中所作的十二張畫都是同一草堆，但是時間一分一秒地溜過去，太陽由各種不同的角度，以各種不同的强度，照射在這草堆上，所表現的色彩豈止十二種，眞是變化萬端，美不勝收，使克蒂門勒感到了灤灤的滿意。</p>
<h3>不肖生近狀</h3>
<p>— 永祥</p>
<p>曾以著「火燒紅蓮寺」等說部馳名之向愷然先生，平江不肖生—現在已經老了，頭髮半已斑白，但是他的身體還是　鑠。居恒沉默寡言，不多與世人往還，然遇着投機的人，與他談話時，仍是滔滔不絕，毫無倦容。其對於書寫信札，及普通應酬文字，多於燈下時奮筆直書，字體挺秀，且仍能書寫蠅頭小楷，可見他目力也不差。</p>
<p>他與前安徽省主席廖磊交情最深，廖羅致門下，府內重要政務多向他諮詢。其居辦公廳時，屬員多畏懼他，其實他並不是聲色俱厲的人，不過他不苟言笑，屬員們恐怕碰他的釘子。</p>
<p>他很有相當的膽量，倭寇盤踞合肥時，他陪廖主席由立煌到皖東去巡視，道經肥西南分路口，向民衆訓話，他也陪同在演講台上，其時天空忽有飛鷹一對，由遠而來，奸徒突高呼敵機來襲，衆突竄散，互踐傷人。獨他與廖仍屹立台上，不爲之動。去歲八路軍騷擾立煌，向被執，卒憑其三寸之舌，終能脫離虎口，不過他一生的積蓄，就在那一次喪失殆盡。他雖是湖南平江人，可是他在六安已量一點薄田，並且還想在城買一所住宅，預備永久居住。原來他喜歡品茗，對於六安齊頭山的茶，和潩河的水，大有依依不捨，樂不思湘之概，</p>
<p>他在近年，喜歡念佛，金剛經，大悲咒，均能背誦無遺，喜歡素食，念珠常不離手，已在皖西某廟，皈依一位和尙，願作佛門弟子。立煌的響山寺，就是他一人監修成功的，要不是受匪軍破壞的話，他還想領導着一羣僧衆打一次佛七，建水陸道塲，爲一般苦鬼超度呢。</p>
<p>他在少年時，也是逐鹿情塲中的健將，他就是「留東外史」現身說法者。現在他的那位夫人，論其年齡，確實也相差甚逮，現在已子女繞膝，最小的不過才六七歲呢。</p>
<h3>「容膝」之外</h3>
<p>— 雷</p>
<p>年輕夫婦倆爲找房屋，去看過了一間小極的公寓房間。他們在離開房主相當距離聽不到談話聲的地方，夫婦倆竊竊私語了一番。妻子後來點點頭，於是丈夫回轉來對房主說，「好的，我想我們可以租下，雖然，房間是太小一點。」</p>
<p>「我倒弄不明白了，」房主說，「到底這種公寓設計建造的時候是預備雙人用的。」</p>
<p>「當然不錯。」年輕丈夫說。「但你可知道，我們希望在室中住兩個人以外，還想養一條金魚作爲玩物呀！」</p>
<h3>逍遙花</h3>

<p>渚齋道：「我以前思想，完全錯誤，現在覺得我們這個家太好了，我捨不得拋開。」鳳笙道：「你不要在我面前多說多話，你果然覺得這個家是好的，也不會和我離婚了。」渚齋道：「當日離婚，原是我一時糊塗，現在我完全明白了，請饒恕我這一遭。」鳳笙道：「我饒恕你這人，也不能饒恕你的心，當日你決然離婚，你心裏一定別有所圖。現在你所想的人，她不嫁你了，所以你又想回家裏來，我雖然是一個女人，我是要守信用的，我不會像你這樣朝三暮四。我們已經離婚了，就應遵照所訂約字辦理。」渚齋道：「你口口聲聲，說要遵照約字辦理，你要知道我們所寫離婚書，是我們二人私訂的，在法律上，並不成立。再說我們離婚，在外並沒宣布，通我們父母都不知道，那能把這一張廢紙，作爲根據呢？」鳳笙道：「那末，你是欺騙我了，我更不能答應你。」渚齋道：「以前的事不用再提，請你饒恕我，把我們所立離婚證書先行取消好不好？」鳳笙道：「不能，不能，你要想把我的字據騙去，是辦不到的，你不要妄想，字據在我手裏，無論如何是不能給你的。」說着，氣忿忿回身，要走進房內。渚齋忙道：「鳳笙你不要誤會，我却沒這意思，你不信，我有憑據給你看。」說着，由衣袋內，把　鄕來的信，拿出來遞給鳳笙道：「你一看就明白，我這次回來是什麼意思。」鳳笙一君是雲卿的信，立時臉上現出很驚愕愕樣子道：「是她的信。」一面說，一面一屁股坐在椅上，把雲卿的信，從頭至尾，看了一遍，又軍看一遍，然後睜着兩眼，注親渚齋的臉，問這：「你的意思是要回來呀？我看你還是在外面好。」渚齋發急道：「你怎麼還不明白我的意思呢？我是一番誠心，悔過自改，求你原諒，你要知道我的脾氣，若不是相信雲卿的話，是不想回來的。」鳳笙道：「那你就不必回來了！」[A&gt;本刊第六期至第十五期目錄（續完）</p>

<h3>America to Send Delegation to China; Joint Conference Committee Passes Compromise Foreign Aid Bill; to be Executed after Presidential Signature</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 1st] The US Senate and House of Representatives Joint Conference Committee passed a $6,098,000,000 global aid bill on the evening of the 1st, which stipulates $338,000,000 for economic aid to China and another $125,000,000 as a gift to China; the latter gift can be used by the Chinese government for military purposes. The term of the entire aid to China plan is one year. The aforementioned bill was passed after 11:00 PM on the 1st and has already been sent to the two houses of Congress, which will quickly pass this compromise plan on the morning of the 2nd and send it to the White House for President Truman to sign. The Joint Conference Committee deleted part of the clauses regarding the purpose of the bill in the Senate's aid to China plan and changed the amount of aid before passing the plan. The economic aid granted to China in the Senate's aid to China plan was reduced by $25,000,000 to $338,000,000, but the amount given to China that can be used by the Chinese government for military purposes was increased to $125,000,000. The Joint Conference Committee also passed the House's proposal to establish a "Sino-American Joint Rural Reconstruction Committee" and stipulate that 5% to 10% of the economic aid to China be used for rural reconstruction in China. Before Congress appropriates funds to implement the aid to China plan, the Reconstruction Bank will advance $50,000,000. The Joint Conference Committee also passed its preface regarding the purpose of aiding China. The deleted preface to the Senate's aid to China bill stated: "Aid to China is necessary to alleviate the suffering of the people, delay economic deterioration, and give China the opportunity to revive its economy through self-help." The new preface states: The purpose and policy of the United States in granting aid to China is, first, to encourage China and its people to exert their long-term joint efforts to accelerate the completion of domestic peace and economic stability; second, to encourage China to maintain true independence and the integrity of its government; and third, to maintain and strengthen individual freedom and free institutions through aid programs based on self-help and cooperation. Aid to China will be conducted in accordance with the appropriate provisions of the Economic Cooperation Act in all aid bills, including the European Recovery Program. This means that economic aid to China will be implemented by the same executor who manages the European Recovery Program. The United States will send a delegation to China to ensure the effective implementation of its plan. Aid will be based on a bilateral agreement. The aid to China bill does not stipulate the specific tasks that China will agree to in the bilateral agreement to ensure that the above funds are effectively used for the purpose of the bill; but the bill specifically stipulates that China should take various measures to improve commercial relations between the two countries. The provisions in the bilateral agreements between the United States and the countries in the European Recovery Program, such as increasing production, stabilizing currency, and assisting in the transportation of strategic materials to the United States, will serve as a guide for the Sino-American agreement negotiations. The aid to China bill only stipulates that $125,000,000 will be given completely to the Chinese government and does not mention military aid. Therefore, it can be said that the bill does not make any commitments to military aid to China. The economic plan, as outlined by the Congressional Committee, will include important imported materials purchased with funds granted or loaned at the discretion of the economic plan executor. The executor can also decide on the rural construction plans that are about to be undertaken. All foreign aid bills also approve: (1) $5.3 billion for the European Recovery Program, which must be approved and appropriated annually, (2) $275 million for military aid to Turkey and Greece, and (3) $60 million for the International Children's Emergency Relief Fund.</p>
<h3>National Assembly to Hold Fifth Preparatory Meeting Today; Formally Elect Presidium; Election Method Amended and Passed Yesterday</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 2nd] The National Assembly held its fourth preparatory meeting at 9:25 AM on the 2nd, amending and passing three articles of the election method for the presidium of the assembly:</p>
<p>(1) The presidium consists of 85 members, who will be elected by the delegates to the assembly from the general list of presidium candidates using an anonymous ballot method. Those with more votes will be elected, and in the event of a tie, lots will be drawn to determine the winner.</p>
<p>(2) The general list of presidium candidates will be composed of candidates generated by the following methods: 1 Each representative unit will elect one candidate, not limited to representatives generated by the unit. When each unit elects presidium candidates, the oldest representative in each unit will convene the election.</p>
<p>2 Ten representatives may jointly nominate one candidate, but each representative is limited to one nomination.</p>
<p>(3) These measures will be implemented after being approved by the preparatory meeting of the National Assembly.</p>
<p>The meeting was still temporarily chaired by Yu Bin. Hong Lanyou read the original letter from the Office of the Civil Service of the National Government, the original submission from the Legislative Yuan, and the National Government's order announcing the amendment of Article 5 of the National Assembly's Organizational Law. Chairman Yu then stated: The number of presidium members has been legally amended from 25 to 85. Next, the method of generating candidates was discussed. Representatives successively spoke or submitted written opinions, reaching 93 people. At 11:00 AM, Chairman Yu announced the cessation of speeches. The opinions submitted afterwards that had not been read will also be considered by the Secretary-General and the Chairman when studying all opinions. After a break, Chairman Yu presented a general new draft and explained that attention should be paid to the mutual election regulations in the Organizational Law, and the opinions of each unit being able to generate a chairman should also be taken into account. However, a small number of representatives insisted that each unit should elect separately, and the units should also be subdivided. Representative Sun Shengwu proposed changing the anonymous multiple-vote method in the first article of Chairman Yu's draft to a single-vote method to make it easier for unit representatives to be generated. Xie Chengping, a representative of the Youth Party, also spoke in favor of Chairman Yu's draft. Finally, after Chairman Yu asked the meeting to speed up the meeting process and conduct a vote, Representative Sun Shengwu's amended draft was approved by a majority of 1,241 out of 2,061 representatives present. Mo Dehui was then selected as the chairman of the fifth preparatory meeting, and the meeting adjourned at 12:10 PM.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 2nd] The National Assembly will adjourn on the morning of the 3rd to carry out the work of electing the presidium. Starting at 8:00 AM, each unit will hold separate meetings in seven locations to elect candidates for their units. At the same time, candidates signed by ten representatives are also being processed separately. It is expected that the election can be completed before 4:00 PM on the 3rd, and the fifth preparatory meeting will be held at 4:00 PM to formally elect the presidium.</p>
<h3>Dispute Over Signature of National Assembly Delegates to be Resolved Flexibly</h3>
<p>So That Those Elected Can Attend the Assembly</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 2nd] The dispute over the withdrawal of signatures by National Assembly delegates is gradually showing signs of resolution. Chen Lifu, Hu Shi, Yu Bin, and others have been discussing with the signatory representatives for several days, and the Kuomintang, Youth Party, and Democratic Socialist Party have also been in contact. The general approach will be to adopt a flexible method so that those elected as signatory representatives can still attend the assembly. This method must be approved by the National Assembly. On the 2nd, some representatives have signed and submitted proposals, requesting the assembly to resolve that the elected signatory representatives be allowed to attend the assembly. It is heard that this proposal has been agreed upon by all parties, but the technical problem of how to get it approved by the National Assembly will be discussed. Among the ten representatives on hunger strike, Su Mingfang and Yang Shilin have been eating for two days and attended the assembly. The remaining eight are still on hunger strike, but are slightly taking fruit. On the morning of the 2nd, He Chengjun, Xu Yuanquan, and others went to persuade them to eat. Zhang Fu, who is the weakest, has slightly taken milk, but is still on hunger strike in the afternoon. Yu Bin visited the hunger-striking representatives again at 5:00 PM on the afternoon of the 2nd to persuade them to eat.</p>

<h3>National Assembly Delegates from 29 Provinces and Cities in the North Petition to See the President</h3>
<p>In Order to Hear the Grand Plan for Suppressing Bandits and Pacifying the Rebellion</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 2nd] National Assembly delegates from 29 provinces and cities in the north recently submitted a petition to Chairman Chiang, requesting that a time and place be designated for an audience to respectfully hear the grand plan for suppressing bandits, pacifying the rebellion, and building the country. The original petition stated: The central government's determination to suppress bandits and pacify the rebellion is deeply believed by hundreds of millions of people in 29 provinces and cities in the north. However, because political and military measures have not been closely coordinated, the bandit flames have become more intense, the bandit disasters have deepened, and the people's suffering has become even greater. The representatives come from the people and have heard and witnessed these things, and dare not remain silent. They intend to request that a time and place be designated for a collective audience to respectfully hear the announcement of effective grand plans for suppressing bandits and pacifying the rebellion and effective measures to save the declining situation, so that they can convey them to the people of 29 provinces and cities in North China and comfort their expectations.</p>

<h3>Decisive Battle to Take Place in Eastern Henan; Situation Around Fuyang in Northern Anhui Improves; Bandit Troops Cross Xiang River by Force on Border of Hubei and Shaanxi</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Hankou, 2nd] Yan Zuyi, Chief of Staff of the Xun Command Headquarters, told our reporter at noon on the 2nd: The bandits Liu and Chen's siege of Fuyang was originally exploratory. Now that they have encountered setbacks, they are bound to flee in a panic. Xu pointed out that another larger-scale battle is brewing in eastern Henan a month ago. The first, second, and tenth columns of Liu's bandits have gathered near Xincai, attempting to make a major move. The National Army has completed a new deployment and began attacking the bandit army on the morning of the 2nd. A decisive battle may break out within a week. When asked about the bandits' intentions, Xu smiled and said that this move may be to support the Fuyang battle, intending to attack in the east and strike in the west. Now that the situation in Fuyang has improved, the bandits in Xincai may invade Runan and Queshan in the west, fleeing back to the southern section of the Pinghan Railway. However, the National Army is prepared and will not find it difficult to crush them. It is also judged that after this battle unfolds, the bandits near Fuyang will inevitably retreat without being attacked.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Xuzhou, 2nd] The bandit army attacking the city walls of Fuyang has suffered casualties of five regiments a day. On the evening of the 1st, they launched continuous attacks on the city walls five times, all of which were repelled by the defending army. However, the Pagoda stronghold six li outside the city has been occupied by the bandits. The strong reinforcements of the National Army have gradually advanced towards the periphery of Fuyang. In order to avoid being attacked from both inside and outside, some of the bandits have crossed the Shayang River and fled east, and hastily built fortifications in Majiadian northeast of Fuyang, attempting to prevent the National Army from reinforcing. However, the National Army has occupied a favorable position, and the bandits will have difficulty succeeding. It is also reported that our air force squadrons are flying to assist in the battle day and night, with brilliant results.</p>

<h3>Chronicles of the National Assembly: It's Hard to Step Down, Difficult to Ascend</h3>
<p>Special Dispatch from This Newspaper (Nanjing, April 2nd)</p>
<p>The preparatory meeting has been going on for four days, and the presidium still hasn't been formed. The presidium has the opportunity to sit on the platform, and some people hope to ascend, but the difficulties are numerous. Those who have sat on the platform before, like Hu Shih and Yu Bin, when the attendees were speaking, calling out, and even pointing fingers at the chair, felt that stepping down was not easy. Bishop Yu Bin, while stealing a moment of leisure, quietly wiped the sweat from his forehead, perhaps thinking, "I can't get away from stepping down, why are you all so bravely demanding to ascend the platform?" It wasn't until 12:10 that it was announced that Mo Dehui would chair the fifth preparatory meeting, and Bishop Yu must have felt relieved.</p>
<p>Although today's meeting was the most peaceful and uneventful, with less chaos and no booing, this only resolution was achieved by the loud appeals of Lin Zigui, a representative from the Fujian region. The chair had intended to put the revised draft of the presidium election method to a vote, and just as the representatives were preparing to press the buttons, someone loudly accused the chair of misinterpreting the articles and misinterpreting the opinions of the representatives over the past three days. Bishop Yu's face turned ashen, and he almost couldn't step down. The time had reached 12 o'clock, which was the legal recess period. Sun Shengwu suggested: "Submit the opinions of the representatives to the secretariat for comprehensive arrangement, taking into account both the units and the talents, and put forward a three-day meeting for discussion." This was originally a way to resolve the situation, but the mood of the attendees could not be resolved by this. Lin Zigui jumped up from his seat, pointed at the microphone, and shouted: "Please pay attention, everyone! Every day we hold a meeting here, the national treasury loses more than 7 billion. How can we hold a meeting for a day without any results? Today, no matter how late we have to continue, we must finish the discussion!" His words were quite effective and also helped Chairman Yu. So Yu Bin immediately seized this popular sentiment: "Judging by everyone's intention, you don't want to break up without any results. Now let's try it out, first put the second draft to a vote. If it doesn't pass, then put the first draft to a vote. Even if both plans don't pass, we can still formulate a third draft." After a unanimous applause, the voting machines emitted colorful lights, with 2141 votes against 820 votes, the second draft passed by a majority. Some people still wanted to speak, but Yu Bin had to find an opportunity to step down himself: "The extended time is up, the meeting is adjourned!"</p>
<p>After the National Assembly Organization Law was revised and passed by the Legislative Yuan to have 85 members in the presidium, the presidium election method originally proposed by the preparatory committee was no longer applicable. Chairman Yu Bin hoped to gather public opinion and let the representatives speak freely. The speech slips flew to the chair like snowflakes at three o'clock, and soon piled up very high. Some representatives were unwilling to speak themselves, so they wrote their opinions on paper and asked the secretary-general to read them on their behalf. This was hard on Hong Lanyou, whose throat was already hoarse. For almost an hour, he sang a solo show, and fortunately, some people still wanted to speak themselves, so Hong Lanyou had the opportunity to drink a cup of tea. Yu Bin said: "Many people have the same opinions, so later only new opinions will be read, and those without new opinions will only have their names read," which also rescued Hong Lanyou. Yu and Hong on the platform were considerate and helpful to each other, cooperating to the most satisfactory extent.</p>
<p>The opinions of nearly a hundred representatives mostly had a consistent view. First, it is hoped that each unit will have a representative to participate in the presidium. Second, the six units in the free professional groups should individually produce chairpersons to participate in the presidium. Third, direct election, each unit separately elects, no need for a general list. Fourth, regarding the surplus beyond one person per unit, some advocated increasing the number proportionally to the number of people in the unit, and some advocated a general election for the surplus. Fifth, for each unit election, two or three times the number of candidates can be nominated, but each unit counts votes separately, ensuring that each unit has one person participating in the presidium. Regarding the quota for women, some advocated separate counting, and one representative even advocated "separate voting for men and women." In addition, the most noteworthy opinion is that "incumbent senior officials should not be candidates for the chair of the National Assembly." Xie Hongxuan said: "Incumbent senior officials participating in the presidium have the suspicion of exercising the powers of the National Assembly on their behalf!" Some applauded, some hissed. No matter what these opinions were, their purpose was the same: "Ascend the platform!" Even if someone ascends the platform and declares that they will never be the chairman, or even cites the precedent of being elected and resigning from the Constituent National Assembly, they are extremely rare.</p>
<p>The chairman is hardworking, and he cannot rest during breaks. He hastily drafted the first draft of the election method. Yu Bin explained that this accommodated the opinions of the representatives, but he insisted on the "mutual election" point and did not stipulate the method of self-election by each unit. The draft method was generally in line with the opinions put forward by Pan Gongzhan and others. On the one hand, each unit elects one candidate, and on the other hand, ten representatives can jointly nominate one person. Yu Bin's method was to use an anonymous cumulative voting method, which not only made it difficult to be elected, but also increased the technical difficulties in counting votes. Someone shouted against it, saying that someone was manipulating it and completely ignored the opinions discussed by everyone for three days. What was that opinion? Each unit elects one person on its own. Yu Bin patiently explained on the platform that he did not distort or manipulate, and according to the revised opinions, he changed the anonymous cumulative voting method to an anonymous single voting method, and put forward a second draft, so that anyone with 25 votes could be elected.</p>
<p>In any case, the second draft was finally passed. Although some people were still dissatisfied, Zi Bin stepped down and sighed deeply. For three days, he didn't have to ascend the platform, but according to the passed election method, on the afternoon and evening of the second and the morning of the third, I don't know how many people were vying for the opportunity to ascend the platform.</p>

<h3>Editorial: The Theme of the Pan-American Conference</h3>
<p>The Ninth Pan-American Conference opened in the capital of Colombia on March 30th and is proceeding according to the agenda. It has now touched on the core of the conference's agenda; the 21 representatives are deeply aware of the danger of communist forces infiltrating all parts of the world, and the need for countries in the Western Hemisphere to work together to strengthen ties. On the opening day of the conference, U.S. Secretary of State Marshall raised the issue of "investigating secret activities by foreign countries against the institutions, peace, and security of American countries," which was unanimously supported by the representatives of the participating countries. From this, it can be seen that the interests of the Pan-American countries are closely related. Therefore, we have sufficient reason to believe that this Pan-American Conference will achieve satisfactory results.</p>
<p>In terms of the agenda of this Pan-American Conference, the most important are the following three: (1) Establishing a permanent American Defense Committee to implement the Pan-American Mutual Defense Treaty signed in the capital of Brazil in September last year; this treaty was approved by the U.S. Congress on December 8th last year. (2) Signing a Pan-American Economic Cooperation Agreement. Latin American countries, for their own economic recovery, all need the assistance of American capital, machinery, and equipment, so everyone hopes that Marshall can also propose a "Marshall Plan" similar to the "European Aid Plan." (3) Establishing a Pan-American Peace System, so that any disputes between American countries can be resolved peacefully. From the above three points, on the one hand, we can know the importance of this Pan-American Conference. In addition to military issues, there are even more important economic issues; therefore, the U.S. delegation of more than 90 people, in addition to Secretary of State Marshall, also includes Secretary of Commerce Harriman and Export-Import Bank President Martin, which shows the importance that the U.S. government attaches to this Pan-American Conference. On the other hand, it can also be known that since the United States wants to obtain the full cooperation of the Pan-American countries in military affairs, the United States must give considerable satisfaction to the wishes of the Pan-American countries in economic terms. U.S. economic assistance to Latin American countries is absolutely no problem in principle; however, at present, the focus of U.S. foreign aid is concentrated in Europe, and whether Latin American countries can also have a "Marshall Plan" at the same time is an important issue.</p>
<p>Looking back at the Pan-American Conference held in the capital of Brazil last year, the Mexican representative, Foreign Minister Bo Taite, repeatedly emphasized the importance of economic cooperation between American countries, and the implication was self-evident. Because since 1942, the total amount of loans lent by the United States to Latin American countries under the Lend-Lease Act was only 796 million U.S. dollars; however, this loan has long been used up; because during the war, the United States concentrated its national manpower and material resources to fight against Germany and Japan; therefore, Latin American countries naturally did not find it convenient to ask the United States for loans all the time. But since the end of the war, the situation has changed, and the need for U.S. dollars in Latin American countries has also increased day by day. In order to seek domestic economic recovery, it is necessary to obtain U.S. economic assistance. What Foreign Minister Bo Taite called economic cooperation refers to "U.S. aid"; however, the U.S. representative has always insisted on first discussing the issue of joint defense of the Western Hemisphere, with the intention that economic cooperation cannot be discussed without first implementing military cooperation. Therefore, the representatives of Latin American countries also followed the wishes of the United States and completed this Pan-American Mutual Defense Treaty; and the issue of economic cooperation was left for future consideration, so the theme of this Pan-American Conference is the issue of economic cooperation.</p>
<p>But since the end of the conference in the capital of Brazil, the U.S. authorities believed that the defense of the Western Hemisphere was no longer a problem since the Pan-American Mutual Defense Treaty had been completed. Therefore, its attention has been focused on Europe. In addition to implementing the Truman Doctrine in Greece and Turkey, the Marshall Plan is also being actively implemented. First, the Emergency Aid to Europe Act was passed by Congress, and now Congress is discussing a large-scale long-term aid to Europe plan, the enormous amount of U.S. dollars required is unprecedented. How can it not arouse the envy of Latin American countries? We studied the psychology of the representatives of Latin American countries and can say that it is completely like this: The United States wants the Western Hemisphere to implement joint defense, and wants the Latin American countries to unanimously support the United States' new anti-Soviet policy. There is no problem in principle; but there is one condition, that is, the United States must also have a "Marshall Plan" for the Latin American countries. According to the report of the United Press, the Colombian representative has proposed a "small Marshall Plan," advocating that the United States lend 5 billion U.S. dollars, managed by an international financial company, for Latin American countries to increase production. Based on this, Marshall's plan to ask Congress to allocate 500 million U.S. dollars to lend to Latin American countries may not be able to satisfy the wishes of Latin American countries. Marshall repeatedly explained the current difficulties of the United States in his speech at the meeting, and asked for the understanding of the Pan-American countries. He said: "Although the United States is prepared to expand the scale of its economic assistance to American countries over the years, in view of the urgent demands in other areas, the contribution that the United States can provide can only include a small part of the development needs of American countries. Therefore, the American countries still need to rely on and encourage domestic and foreign private investment. Assuming that the basic rights and freedoms of mankind are violated in Europe, the New World will also increase its unease. This matter is as deeply related to your country as it is to the United States." The representatives of Latin American countries, after hearing Marshall's "Europe First" theory, I am afraid that only one in ten can express satisfaction!</p>
<p>Looking forward to the future of the Pan-American Conference, although it can proceed smoothly, especially the United States' anti-communist policy will certainly gain the sympathy of most countries, because in Latin American countries, the relationship between the United States and the Soviet Union has always been in favor of the United States' tough approach to the Soviet Union. As the saying goes, "to resist foreign aggression, one must first pacify the domestic front." Marshall came with this mission, asking the countries of the Western Hemisphere to strengthen unity, implement joint defense, and unanimously resist foreign aggression. Naturally, he will not fail to live up to his mission; but in the process of the conference, unexpected twists and turns are inevitable. Because under the principle of "Europe First," if the Pan-American countries cannot obtain huge economic assistance from the United States, then whether in terms of emotion or in fact, they will inevitably show a slight Han attitude towards the military cooperation required by the United States. This is the only hidden reef of the Pan-American Conference. Whether Marshall can avoid touching the reef and make the Pan-American Conference a complete success depends on whether Marshall can avoid adhering to prejudices and making selfish plans.</p>

<h3>A Presidential Candidate of Non-Action Government: Ju Zheng's Words</h3>
<p>[This newspaper, Nanjing, 2nd (airmail)] At the time when the wave of vice-presidential elections was sweeping the capital, the President of the Judicial Yuan, Ju Zheng, announced his candidacy for president in an unusually prominent manner, which was undoubtedly a unique scene in the climax of the election. - Who doesn't think that the president is none other than Chairman Chiang? But when Chairman Chiang had not yet publicly declared his candidacy for president, President Ju Zheng announced his candidacy for president before Chairman Chiang.</p>
<p>Participating in the Accompanying Election</p>
<p>Advocating a Democratic Atmosphere</p>
<p>President Ju Zheng, who first announced his candidacy for president, did not intend to compete with Chairman Chiang for the presidency. On the contrary, he said that when he announced his candidacy for president, he not only repeatedly emphasized that President Chiang was the most suitable, but also repeatedly expressed his hope that President Chiang would be elected. The reporter had interviewed Mr. Ju twice, and his remarks were always full of humility and courtesy. The reporter asked him: "If President Ju is elected president, what will he do first?" Mr. Ju immediately smiled and said: "No, no, the president is of course Chairman Chiang." When he talked about the motivation for the election, he said: "I came out to run for election at the urging of friends and comrades from all sides, entirely to advocate a democratic atmosphere, and it can actually be said to be an accompanying election."</p>
<p>Signing the Book</p>
<p>Absolutely No Praise</p>
<p>Those who support President Ju to come out to run for president are mainly composed of Hubei National Assembly representatives, revolutionary veterans from various provinces, and people from the judicial sector. When President Ju had not yet expressed his willingness to run for election, they had already begun to operate. Among them, the most supportive leader of Mr. Ju can be represented by He Chengrong, and Zhang Zhiben, Mao Zuquan, Xie Guansheng, and others are also the basic guiding forces from the side. Starting yesterday, they have begun to solicit the signatures and nominations of National Assembly representatives. There are no words of praise in the signing book. The front is just a few simple words: "According to the provisions of Article 4 of the Presidential and Vice-Presidential Election and Removal Law promulgated by the National Government on March 31, 1936, we jointly nominate the current President of the Judicial Yuan, Ju Zheng, as a presidential candidate." It is said that this is also the position of President Ju himself. He tried his best to avoid propaganda with praise in the signing of the nomination.</p>
<p>Non-Action Government</p>
<p>Contains Positive Significance</p>
<p>President Ju's usual proposition is "non-action government". When the reporter asked him to express his campaign platform, he always avoided talking about the specific problems of the current political situation. When some questions were mentioned, he did not want to publish them publicly in the newspaper. Regarding the explanation of "non-action government", he said: "Non-action government" is not inaction, but not acting rashly. "People have things they don't do, and then they can have things they can do", so "non-action government" seems passive on the surface, but it still contains positive significance in essence. Mr. Ju is running for president, and he said that "non-action government" is his campaign platform. According to the provisions of the Constitution, the president is only the head of state. If responsibility is implemented at different levels and the system is adhered to, it would be good for the president to achieve "non-action government". The reporter repeatedly asked him what the first thing he would do after being elected president. In addition to humbly saying that he would not be elected, he always said: What to do should be the responsibility of the president of the Executive Yuan. At the same time, although Mr. Ju is unwilling to talk about political views on political reform, he also deeply holds concerns about the current state of the country. The revolution has been reformed for decades, and the Principle of People's Livelihood has not yet been implemented. Mr. Ju advocates that under the current situation, quelling the chaos should be the first priority, seeking stability from quelling the chaos, and seeking construction from stability, but political reform should also be a top priority. When the reporter asked him whether political reform should start from the central government or from the local government, Mr. Ju held a different opinion from Mr. Li Zongren and replied: It should start with local reform. If the grass-roots politics is not reformed, it is useless to rely solely on central reform. The Outline of National Reconstruction stipulates that provincial autonomy will be completed only after the autonomy of each county is completed. It can be seen that political reform must be from the bottom up.</p>
<p>Facing Good Urging</p>
<p>I Will Not Be Active</p>
<p>For the presidential election, Mr. Ju has always advocated adopting a "non-action government" approach. Except for his friends who are conducting election activities for him, he himself is unwilling to conduct any activities. He especially emphasized to the reporter: "I will never treat guests! I will never spend money!" Even whether to invite reporters to publish his campaign platform once is still under consideration. Among the friends who are active in campaigning for him, some advocate adopting a no-publicity approach. They are also doing things based on President Ju's proposition. Xie Guansheng once said to President Ju: He even thinks that a press conference may not be necessary. In the heat of the vice-presidential election, President Ju was the first person to announce his candidacy for president. Mr. Ju is already 73 years old. In terms of revolutionary merit, he should not give way to running for president, but he repeatedly humbly said: "The president is really none other than Chairman Chiang!"</p>

<h3>US, Britain, and France Issue Warning to the Soviet Union: No Interference with Berlin Airlift; Otherwise, Armed Escort Will Be Forced</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Berlin, 2nd] The commanders of the British, American, and French zones have prepared a note, which was submitted to the Soviet authorities at noon on the 2nd. It will state that any attempt by the Soviet Union to control air traffic in and out of Berlin indicates a "shooting incident". When revealing the aforementioned news, authoritative sources also confirmed that although the British side does not intend to protect passenger planes with fighter planes, if the Soviet side refuses the three powers' request not to interfere with the airlift, armed escort will be unavoidable. It is said that the note from the three powers will state that the note does not have a strictly final customs clearance nature, but observers do not understand how diplomatic rhetoric can conceal the true and serious significance of the note.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Berlin, 2nd] Berlin and the western occupied areas currently rely solely on air routes for communication, and the atmosphere in the city is very tense. The Soviet Union has stationed sentries at various road junctions, equipped with tanks, jeeps, and other equipment, to prevent the passage of cars and buses. In addition, there are rumors that the Soviet army is busy mobilizing. People close to the Soviet authorities expect that the Soviet Union will soon control air traffic, but as of 1:00 PM, nine of the twenty-two American transport planes originally scheduled to fly to Berlin have safely arrived in Berlin.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Berlin, 2nd] British military sources have recently confirmed that when British planes flew over the Soviet military area of Berlin, Soviet fighter planes dived or hovered near them once or twice, but when protesting to the Soviet authorities, the Soviet side denied the incident. American planes have also encountered similar incidents when flying to Berlin. A British spokesman solemnly denied that the British side had ever considered escorting with fighter planes.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Berlin, 1st] The head of the Soviet intelligence agency, Shabanov, told Germans in Walled City in the Soviet military area that a large number of spies from the British and American areas were sneaking into Berlin and transferring to other places in the Soviet area to spy on military, political, and economic news. The Soviet Union can no longer tolerate the "plunder" of Berlin by the British and Americans.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Berlin, 2nd] The four-power deputy commanders of Britain, the United States, France, and the Soviet Union in Berlin held their weekly routine meeting as usual today, but the Soviet Union's intensified control of traffic was not on the agenda. In addition, the four-power joint military government in Berlin is still continuing its normal activities.</p>
<h3>US and Britain Pay Attention to the Berlin Incident: Soviet Union Strengthens Border Traffic Control, US Planes Airlift Food to Supply Military and Civilians</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] London, 2nd broadcast: The Soviet Union is intensifying its blockade of Berlin, and even railway transportation will be affected. Twenty-three American military aircraft have landed at Dengbelhof Airport, carrying food to supply residents in the American-occupied area of Berlin. Another six or seven planes will arrive soon. In addition, five American passenger planes have arrived. British trains carrying food passed through the Soviet-occupied area and were only subjected to ordinary inspections. The Soviet side did not obstruct the movement of aircraft. Judging from various signs, the Soviet blockade is unlikely to ease, because after Britain and the United States protested, the Soviet Union declared, "We will not change what we have already decided."</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 1st] Regarding the Soviet Union's control of traffic between Berlin and West Germany, diplomatic officials here believe this is the beginning of the Soviet Union's attempt to force Western countries to withdraw from Berlin. General Clay, the commander of the US forces in Berlin, has the right to take all countermeasures, and the State Department reiterated the US's determination to stay in Berlin. Some people believe that Clay's actions will not go beyond the established policy of the US government. The State Department and the Department of Defense do not show any signs of panic and seem to hope that this serious dispute can be resolved locally without escalating to an unmanageable level. However, Berlin has long been regarded as a testing ground for US-Soviet foreign policy, with crises lurking on all sides. If both sides are forced to show their cards, it is related to their own prestige, especially at a time when the United States is guaranteeing that European countries will resist Soviet expansion.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 1st] British Foreign Office officials are very indignant at the developments in Berlin and are prepared to take a firm stand, but what kind of action will be taken has not yet been decided. The Western countries have not yet obtained any legal basis to deal with the Soviet Union's traffic control measures. Officials from the German Department of the Foreign Office pointed out that the four-power written agreement only stipulates the four-power occupation and joint management of Berlin and does not prohibit any country from inspecting personnel entering and exiting. The Soviet Union's move has undoubtedly gone far beyond the spirit of the four-power understanding, but it is expected that it will be difficult to achieve results if the Western countries negotiate with them on this basis. Moreover, the measures taken by the Soviet Union in Berlin have already been implemented in the Soviet military area of Yue country, and the United Kingdom, the United States, and France have not previously expressed any objection. This is also one of the reasons why it is inconvenient for the Western countries to take a tough attitude.</p>
<p>[United Press, Chenggong Lake, 2nd] The struggle between the East and West in Berlin caused great anxiety in the United Nations on the 2nd. Generally, it is feared that the great powers will show their cards in Berlin, which will have a serious or even unmanageable impact on the United Nations. The possibility of submitting the traffic dispute to and from Berlin to the Security Council or the General Assembly is almost zero. It is believed that even if the issue is raised, the United Nations will not be able to do anything.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Berlin, 2nd] A British military train, after being blocked for twenty hours at the Marienborn station on the border of the Soviet-occupied area, returned to Berlin on the morning of the 2nd. Shortly after the British train left Marienborn, the Soviet authorities closed the 100-mile railway between Berlin and the Soviet-occupied area checkpoint of Vulsfeide, prohibiting traffic at night and requiring special permits for traffic during the day. The military trains carrying coal from the Ruhr to Berlin all take this route. At the same time, it is learned that the families of twelve German railway staff members near Marienborn station have been ordered to move out by the Soviet authorities to provide housing for Soviet border troops. The 800 residents of Walteich Village, five miles north of Marienborn, have also been ordered to move out to provide housing for Soviet troops. According to the German News Agency, the obstacles set up by the Soviet army at one intersection of the crossroads on the side of the Gedo airfield on the edge of the British military area in Berlin were removed on the night of the 1st, and the other three intersections are still blocked by the British army. The Soviet authorities have lifted the control of the transportation of goods from the Soviet area to other areas in Berlin on the night of the 1st, but well-informed sources said that the Soviet authorities will implement stricter control next Monday. Two US military transport planes, carrying 15,000 pounds of food needed by the US military personnel in Berlin from the US military area of Germany, safely arrived at the Tanbu Erhof Airport in the US military area of Berlin on the night of the 1st.</p>
<h3>News Conference Passes Peacetime News Censorship Case: Freedom of the Press Principles to Be Voted On</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Geneva, 1st] The Soviet Union today formally recommended to the International Conference on Freedom of the Press that all advocates of fascist propaganda or any form of aggressor should not enjoy the right to freedom of thought and expression. The Soviet Union is making amendments to a resolution on freedom of the press principles proposed by the United States. British representative 台夫斯 pointed out that the words in the US resolution condemning all monopolies, especially government monopolies, are equivalent to prohibiting the "British Broadcasting Corporation". He suggested deleting the aforementioned words. The conference will vote on the 2nd on the US resolution and the British and Soviet amendments. The conference today also passed that peacetime news censorship should be prohibited unless it is necessary for military security. Peacetime news censorship should meet six conditions, including that reporters must be informed of the conditions of censorship in advance, and that reporters must not suffer unnecessary delays and expenses. These six effects were passed by a vote of nineteen to six against Eastern Europe.</p>
<h3>US Congress Joint Resolution: Repeal Aid to Spain Plan</h3>
<p>[United Press Washington 1st dispatch] The joint committee of the Senate and House of Representatives voted today that unless the six countries of Western Europe independently invite the Spanish government to participate, the country will not be included in the Marshall Plan for European Recovery. This resolution was made less than an hour after an official announcement that Marshall was completely opposed to Spain being included in the aid program. The Senate has already rejected inviting Spain to participate, and heated debate is expected when the House reconsiders the matter, but it is generally expected that the joint committee's resolution will be accepted in the end. The committee is currently continuing to discuss the $6.205 billion foreign aid bill passed by the House last night, attempting to reconcile the differences between the two houses regarding the portion for aid to China.</p>
<h3>Marshall Asks South American Countries to Prevent the Spread of Communism, Accuses the Soviet Union of Threatening World Peace</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Bogota, 1st United Press Dispatch] Marshall recently condemned the Soviet Union for preventing the world from achieving peace and called on South American countries to contribute to the Marshall Plan to help the United States contain the spread of communism in Europe. He told the second plenary session of the Ninth Pan-American Conference: "If human rights and freedoms disappear in Europe, they will also become insecure in the New World." Marshall did not give any hints on what kind of action the conference should take to contain communism. When he focused on discussing economic issues, he gave South American countries bad news, namely that they cannot expect to receive any special assistance from the United States. In addition to his prepared speech, Marshall made an impassioned statement, saying that the United States is spending billions on military construction to defend the entire Western Hemisphere against subversive actions.</p>

<p>[Reuters Washington 1st dispatch] President Truman authorized Defense Secretary Forrestal today to prepare detailed estimates for $3 billion to add to US military equipment during the fiscal year from September 1948 to June 1949. In a letter to House Speaker Martin, the President pointed out that this additional $3 billion is necessary to meet the United States' international responsibilities. Truman also asked Congress to approve an appropriation of $375 million for the next fiscal year for the Federal Supply Bureau to order strategic materials. Truman's letter pointed out that the United States, with its foreign aid program and the increase of its military strength, will be able to reduce international tensions and move towards the goal of achieving a reasonable and lasting peace.</p>
<p>[United Press Washington 1st dispatch] The House today passed an additional military spending bill of $324 million by a vote of 339 to 3, of which $150 million was given to the original Tenth Army Committee, and the rest was for occupation troop expenses and the construction of the Alaskan military highway.

However, Clapp warned that the next few years will definitely be extremely difficult, and the Japanese people should shoulder the responsibility for the country's economic recovery.</p>
<p>It is reported that Clapp and his delegation arrived here on March 20 and, after a thorough two-week inspection, took a plane back to the United States at 5:00 pm.</p>

<h3>General Chennault on US Policy Toward China</h3>
<p>Copyright Scripps-Howard Newspaper Alliance</p>
<p>Translated by the Newspaper Translation Department</p>
<p>(7) My Relationship with General Stilwell</p>
<p>If I can manage to analyze it, my three-year dispute with General Stilwell was due more to a conflict of methods than to a conflict of personalities. His dispute with the Chinese Central Government, on the other hand, was a combination of both.</p>
<p>I know that General Stilwell, based on information from his subordinates, believed that I made the Chinese oppose him. This is not surprising. It is not easy for a superior officer to believe that he is not well-liked because of himself.</p>
<p>But I am convinced that his ability and method of dealing with Chinese leaders was the main factor in his failure and the disruption of Sino-American wartime cooperation between 1942 and 1944.</p>
<p>From the beginning, General Stilwell never concealed his dislike for me and for the Chinese leaders he dealt with, so it was not easy for me to treat him as a friend.</p>
<p>I have a longer and more intimate practical understanding of the Sino-Japanese War than any other American, but General Stilwell never consulted me on any important issue regarding Sino-American military relations. When I offered advice, it was often contemptuously rejected.</p>
<p>Although I was his senior air force officer and Chiang Kai-shek's air force chief of staff, I was never called to the war zone headquarters to present my views on our air situation until after General Wedemeyer replaced Stilwell in 1944.</p>
<p>I do not feel ashamed that I often disagreed with Stilwell on policy, but I always faithfully executed every order he gave me. I do not argue that I was always right and Stilwell was always wrong. Under my guidance, mistakes were indeed made, but I believe that most of these mistakes were procedural rather than judgmental.</p>
<p>Our disagreements never reached the point of a public break, which is a success in that we both knew our limits. As later events proved, Stilwell's failure was entirely due to his relationship with the Chinese and his incorrect strategic choices in dealing with the war against Japan.</p>
<p>Long before he was recalled, General Stilwell had forbidden me to hold press conferences, even though I was the commander of the Fourteenth Air Force, whose headquarters was located in Kunming. The Chongqing War Zone Headquarters believed that only the war zone commander could meet with journalists at press conferences, although in fact, for most of the war, the Fourteenth Air Force was the only US combat unit in China and was therefore of great interest to the American public. The war zone headquarters' regulations and the field correspondent's insistence to the contrary forced me to adopt a ridiculous compromise, which was a "collective interview with journalists" instead of a press conference. The only difference was that the correspondent did not say "press conference" but "meeting" in the news he released. This slight difference seemed to satisfy everyone involved, including the war zone commander.</p>
<p>In 1945, as my mission as air force commander was coming to an end, it became very clear that even though Stilwell had been gone from China for a year, his judgment still carried weight in Washington, to my disadvantage. During my tenure as commander, I was always the target of malicious rumors and gossip spread by irresponsible officials. I am afraid that senior officials must have believed it and did not consider the truth.</p>
<p>In 1945, I was accused of failing to cooperate with General Stilwell, but it was the Fourteenth Air Force, which Stilwell sometimes considered dangerous and talked about, that completely ruined the US effort in China, as I will point out in these memoirs.</p>
<p>In 1945, before the air war in China had been won and far from confirming this achievement, a senior air force headquarters was established in Chongqing. Perhaps not on the surface, but in reality, I believe this action was directed at me.</p>
<p>I came to China in 1937 because I was invited to establish the Chinese Air Force. I stayed in China because I wanted to help China defeat Japan, which was four years before the Pearl Harbor incident.</p>
<p>After the Pearl Harbor incident, I re-enlisted in the US Army because I believed there was greater work to be done.</p>
<p>In July 1945, my usefulness to the United States and China in the war was over, so I retired from the US Army again. I retired with some disappointment, but I remained firmly convinced that Stilwell was an excellent field commander—one of the best division commanders the United States has ever produced.</p>

<h3>Unhappy Exit of Reynal: Quietly Flies Back, Adventure Plane Impounded, Our Government Will Officially Protest to the US Ambassador</h3>
<p>[Reported by this Newspaper] After Reynal announced the abandonment of his exploration plan, Zhu Jiaju, Director of the Academia Sinica, and Sa Bentong, Director of the Institute of Physics of the Academia Sinica, telegraphed the Shanghai Civil Aviation Administration office yesterday morning to impound his exploration plane. Unexpectedly, Reynal, along with his pilot Auden, co-pilot Lee, and radio operator Lear, after arriving in Shanghai from Ping by the damaged exploration plane the day before yesterday afternoon, quietly got up from the Lizhi Society guest house where they were staying at 3:00 am yesterday morning, drove to Longhua Airport, and took off from Shanghai at around 6:00 am. By the time the Civil Aviation Administration discovered this, it was too late to stop them, and they were instructed to return to Shanghai by radio, but the plane ignored it and flew directly to Calcutta, India. The Civil Aviation Administration immediately telegraphed the "escape" of the plane to Nanjing. Unexpectedly, at around 9:00 pm last night, the "Exploration" plane suddenly flew back to Longhua Airport. The reason for this is said to be that it had not contacted the Indian side in advance, so the Calcutta Airport did not allow it to land, and it had no choice but to fly back to Shanghai. The Shanghai office of the Civil Aviation Administration was very surprised to see the plane fly back and immediately impounded it. As for Reynal himself, after this "dishonorable" futile round trip, he did not stay at the Lizhi Society guest house last night, but stayed at the Cathay Hotel. He claimed that he would go to Beijing this morning to explain to the authorities. It is reported that Reynal's exploration plan started in mid-January this year. He came to China twice and traveled between Beijing and Shanghai, formally establishing the exploration team under the contact with our government authorities and the Academia Sinica, with scientists from both China and the United States participating. On the 7th of last month, his self-funded exploration plane came to China from the United States. Unexpectedly, after arriving in Shanghai, the fuel tank leaked oil and flew back to the United States for repairs. On the 26th of last month, the plane came to China for the second time and arrived in Shanghai. Everyone thought that the exploration work would be able to proceed smoothly, and Chinese and American scientists went to Lanzhou to wait first. Unexpectedly, the plane took off from Shanghai on the 28th, and the original route was from Hankou to Lanzhou, but it temporarily claimed that it was raining in Hankou, and without the consent of our Civil Aviation Administration, it changed its route and flew to Beiping. When it took off from Ping on the 31st, the right wheel suddenly tilted, causing a propeller to be damaged. Reynal immediately expressed discouragement and announced the cancellation of the exploration. After the damaged plane was repaired, it flew to Shanghai the day before yesterday afternoon, without contacting our Civil Aviation Administration in advance. After arriving in Shanghai, the Shanghai office of the Civil Aviation Administration instructed Reynal to complete the formalities and asked how long he would stay in Shanghai. Reynal said that it would take at least two or three days to repair it. Unexpectedly, he quietly flew away before dawn yesterday, and finally had to fly back late at night. After repeated setbacks and delays, this Jishi Mountain exploration plan, which attracted the attention of the whole country and even the world, was officially called off in an unhappy state.</p>
<p>The content of the telegram sent by Zhu Jiahua and Sa Bentong yesterday morning stated: "Shanghai Civil Aviation Administration, please notify Longhua Airport that Reynal's plane must not leave China before completing the completion procedures." Now that the plane has returned, Reynal must have a headache to complete the completion procedures and cannot "just walk away." As for the Chinese and American scientists, Kosvi and Ross, who had already gone to Lanzhou, flew to Beijing and Shanghai to return to the United States yesterday, and the rest will also pack up and return, and the mysterious Animaqing Mountain will still be a mystery to the world.</p>
<p>[Another Report] According to the Associated Press Nanjing news, Sa Bentong issued a written statement accusing Reynal of violating the Sino-US agreement on the Jishi Mountain exploration. The government authorities will also formally protest to US Ambassador Stuart Leighton.</p>
<p>"Come to Chicago to Collect Unsettled Accounts in China"</p>
<p>The reporter visited Reynal at the Cathay Hotel late last night to inquire about his motive for leaving Shanghai in a hurry. Reynal said: "It is rumored that the Chinese government impounded my plane because my accounts in China were not settled, but I have had a lot of money dealings all over the world in the past, and if there are any unsettled accounts, they will be sent to Chicago to be handled. If there are any unsettled accounts in China this time, they can also be sent to Chicago to be collected." He also said: "Flying to Calcutta today was not because the airport there did not allow landing, but because I thought of the passport not being completed on the way, so I still flew back to Shanghai."</p>
<h3>Spot Checks on Speculative Firms, Several Found to Have Concrete Evidence, Three Secret Radio Stations Cracked</h3>
<p>[Reported by this Newspaper] Since the 1st, the city's financial control agencies have sent personnel to conduct spot checks on several firms and shops suspected of speculation and operating in the black market for Hong Kong dollars and gold. As of yesterday, concrete evidence has been found for Xinghua Company in Qingyuan Lane, Beijing Road, Chengchang Company in Sichuan Road, Longxing Iron Company in No. 47 Lane, Chengdu Road, Yinghe Company in No. 12, Lane 301, Weihai Road, and several commercial banks. In addition, three secret radio stations have been cracked. Investigations are currently being expanded and will be announced after a period of time.</p>
<h3>Plotting to Purchase Gold Bars, Five Suspects Detained, Involving an Employee of the Bank of China</h3>
<p>[Reported by this Newspaper] The police station's Economic Police Brigade yesterday received a report and seized a black market gold case at No. 38, Lane 404, Haining Road, and detained five suspects, Zheng Zuoyi, Huang Zezhen, Wu Xuecheng, and Li Zhenwu. During the investigation of this case, because the suspects were extremely cunning, the police station had to work hard and sent personnel to dress up and make contact several times in advance. Zheng Zuoyi, the person in charge of the place, initially refused sternly. Only after explaining that he was introduced by someone did he agree to talk. However, Zheng requested that all transactions be in cash. The police officer originally planned to purchase four large bars, but Zheng only promised one bar, with a price of 285 million legal tender, and still insisted on paying in cash. The police officer had no choice but to return to ask for instructions. After the police station borrowed cash from the Financial Administration, he took the money back to the place again. However, Zheng suddenly said that he was out of stock. After repeated consultations, Zheng notified Huang Zezhen, an employee of the Financial Investigation Office of the Bank of China, by telephone, and then Huang introduced him to Jiang's Xie Kang Money Shop at No. 88 Nanjing East Road to pick up the goods, and Zheng accompanied the police officer with cash to the shop. After the shop employee checked that it was correct, he only issued a receipt for 285 million legal tender, and then claimed that he had no goods. The police officers saw that they were repeatedly shirking responsibility and were afraid of other problems. They showed their identity and searched the shop, but found nothing. Jiang took the opportunity to escape. In addition to the fact that the borrowed money was not lost, only the above-mentioned suspects were taken to the police station for questioning.</p>

<h3>Wu Kaixian to Go to Nanjing to Request Extension of Food Rationing</h3>
<p>[Reported by this Newspaper] Wu Kaixian, Director of the Social Affairs Bureau, went to Nanjing on official business last night. It is reported that the mission of this trip is as follows: (1) The city-wide food rationing has been implemented since March for a period of four months, scheduled to end in June. However, at that time, it is the period when the new crops are not yet available, and the cessation of food rationing will have a great impact on people's food and food prices. This trip is to discuss with the central government the extension of the implementation date of food rationing. (2) The city's Labor-Management Arbitration Committee resolved to request the Social Affairs Bureau to recommend to the central government to increase the types and quantities of in-kind allocations for workers, and to reduce the allocation price in order to stabilize the index.

<h3>China Petroleum Corporation to Prepare to Establish Four Gas Stations</h3>
<p>[Reported by this Newspaper] The China Petroleum Corporation of the Resources Committee is actively planning to set up gas stations in four key locations: Zhongshan Park, Zhongzheng Park, North Railway Station, and the intersection of Sichuan Road and Suzhou Road, before the second half of the year, which can be said to be a precursor to privately-run gas stations. This plan is still awaiting final approval from the Municipal Bureau of Public Works before construction can begin.</p>
<h3>Customs Strengthens Efforts to Combat Smuggling; Confiscation Accompanied by Penalties</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] According to the recently promulgated regulations for punishing smuggling, the Jianghai Customs has strengthened its anti-smuggling work starting from the first day of this month. In addition to the existing anti-smuggling personnel, customs police have been stationed at various port and airport terminals starting today to assist in the execution of duties. The customs has also posted notices in prominent positions at various port and airport terminals, stating that any false declaration, clandestine transportation, concealed carrying, impersonation, concealment, or secret unloading will be regarded as smuggling. In addition to the confiscation of smuggled goods, the offender will be sent to court for investigation and prosecution. According to the person in charge of the Jianghai Customs' anti-smuggling efforts, previously, ordinary smuggling cases did not involve judicial proceedings; according to customs regulations, only the smuggled goods were confiscated, and there were no provisions for imprisonment for smugglers. Now that the Legislative Yuan has passed the regulations for punishing smuggling, there are provisions for punishing smugglers. In the future, when the customs discovers smuggling cases, in addition to the confiscation of the smuggled goods, the smuggling offender will be transferred to the local court for trial according to judicial procedures. If passengers mistakenly bring a small amount of contraband due to unfamiliarity with customs regulations, the customs will deal with the goods but does not intend to transfer them to the court, as such cases are common and numerous, and it is practically impossible to subject them to judicial review one by one. However, it is difficult to distinguish the standard for what constitutes smuggling and what does not. If there are no clear regulations, abuses will inevitably arise in the future. The customs authorities are currently considering this issue in detail.</p>
<h3>Comical Lawsuit is Incoherent; Most Glorious Title is "Bailiff;" Request to Confirm Zhang Zhongyuan has Mental Illness</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] A certain Gao Jingqing often sends lawsuits to the court, but their contents are mostly incomprehensible. For example, in June of last year, he filed a lawsuit with the High Court's Civil Division accusing Shen Junru of "obstructing civic duties," which was completely nonsensical. Yesterday, he filed another lawsuit with the District Court's Civil Division against City Councilor Zhang Zhongyuan, requesting confirmation that the defendant is in a state of mental illness. The District Court refused to accept it on the grounds that the lawsuit was incoherent. The reporter requested to read the lawsuit, which was comical and bizarre. It began with a lengthy description of his experiences, with his most glorious title being "Bailiff of the First Special District Court," and now "my wife is a peddler, sorry, sorry." The object of the lawsuit: "(1) The defendant, the Chinese Furniture Industry Guild, should submit to the Shanghai Education Bureau for identification as to whether he had a mental illness before December 31, 1947, and within six months from the date of the judgment, he should be ordered to provide a diagnosis report. (2) The defendant Zhang Zhongyuan should submit to the Shanghai Branch of the Chinese Red Cross Society's First Hospital Department of Psychiatry for identification as to whether he had a mental illness before December 31, 1947, and within six months from the date of the judgment, he should be ordered to provide a diagnosis report. (3) All litigation costs shall be borne by the defendant." Etc. The District Court refused to accept it, and Gao was still resentful.</p>
<h3>Heavy Sea Fog; Egyptian Ship Arrives in Port This Morning</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The Egyptian ship El Sudan, represented by the French Postal Ship Company, arrived in Shanghai from Europe via Australian ports. It was originally scheduled to arrive yesterday, but it is reported that due to heavy sea fog, navigation was hindered and it will be delayed until 9:00 AM this morning to arrive in Shanghai, berthing at the Gonghexiang Wharf.

<h3>Crackdown on Illegal Ships; Revised Fine Standards</h3>
<p>The Public Utilities Bureau of the city previously promulgated the "Provisional Penal Regulations for Cracking Down on Ships in Shanghai," the amount of the fines stipulated therein were mostly based on the license tax rates stipulated by the Finance Bureau. This standard of fines, for ships that are damaged and not repaired but still sailing, and ships that are overloaded with cargo or passengers, is, according to the current situation, too small to serve as a warning. The fine has now been revised. All illegal fines have been revised to conform to the fees for measurement and inspection, license plates, and uniforms stipulated by the bureau, in order to be in line with reality. It is understood that the new fine has been approved by the Municipal Council and will be announced and implemented immediately.</p>
<h3>To Boost Morale; Raise Shoes for the Troops; This City Must Raise Two Million Pairs</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] In order to boost morale and invigorate the military's spirit, the National Government has decided to launch a movement in various provinces and cities to raise cloth shoes for the troops. It has recently instructed the Shanghai Municipal Government to issue implementation measures, stipulating that various provinces and cities should raise funds in five grades. This city is classified as a special grade, and the total amount raised nationwide is 15 million pairs, and this city is required to raise 2 million pairs. The counties and cities take Jia (the first rank) as the fundraising unit, and the principle is to raise funds from wealthy households. Ordinary households are free to donate, and old, weak, poor households are exempt from fundraising. The fundraising period starts from April 1 and ends at the end of May. In addition to the required amount for each household, those who can voluntarily donate more than ten pairs will be rewarded by the county government, more than one hundred pairs will be rewarded by the provincial and municipal governments, and more than one thousand pairs will be rewarded by the Executive Yuan. As for the style and material of the shoes, this city will notify each household separately by each district.</p>
<h3>Xu Jizhuang Case Continues; Lawyers Cross-Examine Witnesses</h3>

<h3>Six Times the Estimated Profit Tax; Various Trade Associations Request Reduction Again</h3>
<p>This year's profit tax for profit-seeking enterprises, as stipulated by the Ministry of Finance, is estimated at six times the amount of profit tax from the previous year. The Municipal Council and the Municipal Chamber of Commerce had previously represented 126 trade associations in this city, and asked the central government to withdraw the order, but it was not adopted. Recently, after the Direct Taxation Bureau issued estimated payment notices in accordance with the above tax amount, 111 trade associations in this city, such as cotton yarn, cotton cloth, knitting, and inland river shipping, jointly submitted a letter to the Municipal Council again yesterday, listing reasons and requesting that it be forwarded to the Ministry of Finance, to consider the difficulties of the business, to allow for flexible collection methods. The four opinions originally submitted were: (1) Reduce the estimated payment multiple, (2) Postpone the payment period, (3) Exempt from further auditing after occupying and paying, (4) Those who have experienced significant differences in business prosperity or decline for two years, or whose tax burden is too heavy to pay, are allowed to apply for auditing immediately, and the decision on payment or exemption will be made after auditing. As for the reasons for requesting a reduction listed in the original letter, the most important is that according to the new Income Tax Law that has been amended and passed by the Legislative Yuan, its provisions on the starting point and tax rate have not reached six times the number of the previous year, and industrial and commercial profits and losses vary from year to year. Last year, due to rising prices, purchasing power decreased, while wage expenses increased sharply, and profits should not be compared with prices in general.</p>
<h3>Police Bureau Starts Planning; Traffic Measures During the National Games</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The first National Games after the victory is approaching, and the City Police Bureau, in order to prevent traffic congestion at that time, has started planning traffic control measures during the National Games.

Another plan of the Police Bureau is to prepare to use the open space from the North Zhaqing Road to the Henan Road on the south bank of Suzhou Creek to open a large parking lot, clear coal and timber planks, and replace them with neat and clean street trees. If the construction there is completed, it can accommodate 600 cars, not only will the congestion of vehicles in the Beijing Road and Sichuan Road area be improved, but it can also become the most complete and ideal parking lot in this city. In addition, this year's summer police uniforms for the city's police have been drafted by the Police Bureau, and the budget is being reviewed. It is heard that the traffic police will still use the current helmets, but the uniforms are planned to be improved in order to attract the attention of drivers.</p>

<h3>Female Teacher Becomes Destitute; Young Woman Commits Suicide</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Li Chen Huijun, a young woman from Zhenjiang, 26 years old, used to be an elementary school teacher in her hometown. She married a fellow villager Li four years ago and had a daughter who is only three years old. Last winter, due to a quarrel between the couple, she left in a fit of anger. She went to Nanjing to find work but was unsuccessful. She came to Shanghai alone and was introduced to Yongle Sheng Candy Store at 225 Guangyuan Road as a maid. The hostess, Sun, pitied her and treated her differently. However, Huijun was still depressed all day long. On the 27th of last month, she wrote to her husband, saying that if you have any feelings for me as a couple, please come to Shanghai on April 1 for a final meeting.

<h3>Councilor Shi Zongde Accused of Forgery</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The District Prosecutor's Office is scheduled to open a court session today in the case of Councilor Shi Zongde being accused of forgery by brick and tile merchant Wang Zuo. The content of the lawsuit is roughly as follows: Shi is the chairman of the Brick and Tile Industry Association of this city. Another brick and tile merchant Wang Zuo, Qu Changqing, etc., planned to organize a brick and tile industry association. Shi came out to interfere, and a dispute arose between the two sides. Later, the Social Bureau mediated and merged the two industry associations and re-elected. As a result, Shi was still elected as the chairman, and Wang was elected as the director. However, the two eventually had a grudge and became incompatible. A few days ago, Shi deliberately showed a number of confidential letters to people at a tea party in Qinglian Pavilion, claiming that someone had accused Wang Zuo, and satirized Wang for resigning from his position as director. Wang believed that this document was forged and believed that another person, Sun Yourong, conspired with Shi, so he sued them together. Yesterday, Shi had a letter to the District Prosecutor's Office, stating that today he was convening a meeting of members of the Brick and Tile Industry Association, and the time conflicted, so he requested a postponement of the interrogation.</p>

<h3>Han Langen and Others Accused of Breach of Trust and Fraud; Borrowed Money to Build a Factory and Make Films; Failed to Complete on Time</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Old-fashioned comedian "Skinny Monkey" Han Langen, and Shen Mengshi and Gao Wenliang of Huaguang Film Studio, were accused yesterday by Liao Zhenxing, a film merchant residing at 923 Huamao Apartment, Changle Road, of breach of trust and fraud. In the spring of last year, Huaguang Film Studio built its own factory in Huangjiatang, Xietu Road, Nanshi. Due to lack of funds, Han and others borrowed 100 million yuan from Liao, promising that Liao would complete two films within six months, and guaranteed completion on April 25, 1941. Liao advanced 76 million yuan in installments. After receiving the money, Han and others not only did not build the factory, but also signed contracts with New Era Film Studio and Dahua Film Studio, charging rent. They also contacted socialite Hua Xianglin, who invested and cooperated in filming the movie "Dreams of Joining the Army." Liao sent someone to Huangjiatang, Xietu Road, to inspect, and the house was not yet built. The filming equipment was all missing. Liao repeatedly negotiated with Han and others, asking them to fulfill the contract, but to no avail. Yesterday, he filed a lawsuit with the District Prosecutor's Office accusing Han and others of breach of trust and fraud. The District Prosecutor's Office is scheduled to open a court session on the morning of the 7th of this month.</p>

<h3>Local Basic Education Symposium Convened Yesterday by the Ministry of Education Discussing Principles for the Distribution of Subsidies</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper in Nanjing, 2nd] The Ministry of Education convened a local basic education symposium at 3:00 PM on the 2nd. More than 30 representatives from the education associations of the Northeast, North, Northwest, East, and South regions, as well as from the education departments or associations of Jiangsu, Jiangxi, Guangxi, Hunan, Yunnan, Xinjiang, Taiwan, Chongqing, Beijing, and other provinces and cities, including Jin Zencheng and Jiang Xuezhu, attended. Many key members of the Ministry of Education's relevant departments and divisions also participated. Minister Zhu Jiahua and Vice Minister Yu Zhici presided over the meeting in turn. Each attending representative discussed the "Principles for the Distribution of Subsidies for Local Basic Education" proposed by the Ministry of Education, item by item, offering opinions for reference. The key points of the principles set by the Ministry of Education are as follows: (1) The principle is to concentrate the use of this funding to maximize effectiveness. (2) Distribution Principles: (A) 77% will be used to universally subsidize each province and city, totaling 616 billion, emphasizing both quality and quantity, and paying attention to the development of national education in remote and impoverished areas. (B) 20% will be used for the expenses of demonstration areas for universal and basic education, totaling 160 billion, designating the capital and Beiping as basic education demonstration areas, to complete universal education within two years, half of the funding for universal education will be raised locally. (C) 3% will be used for experimental research and compilation of teaching materials, totaling 24 billion. (3) Each province and city should follow the principles of allocated universal basic education plans to spend funds: (A) 73% for basic education; (B) 17% for supplementary education; (C) 10% for teacher training. (4) Each province and city should concentrate on central national schools for the use of this subsidy in basic education, with two-thirds used to enrich equipment such as books and teaching aids, and the remainder for qualified teacher grants (urban schools emphasize expansion, rural schools emphasize quality improvement). Half of the subsidy for books and equipment will be allocated within the funds subsidized to each province and city. The ministry will form a procurement committee based on the needs of each region to uniformly manage distribution. In supplementary education, it should be concentrated in the larger cities of each province. (5) Each province and city should raise sufficient funds to match the central government's subsidy funds for joint subsidies, at least 20% of provincial education expenses and 70% of county and city basic education expenses must be allocated, otherwise, the central government will reduce the subsidy amount. (6) The subsidy fees that each province's pacification area should receive should be allocated proportionally, and no additional allocation will be made in the future. If it is temporarily impossible to use, it should be reserved or purchase supplies for future use. (7) Each province and city should publicly allocate and announce the amount distributed to each county, city, and district, as well as the dates of income and expenditure, and the ministry will send personnel to audit at any time. (8) For each province and city in the Northeast, in addition to purchasing supplies for future use in bandit areas, the regions where teaching is possible will still be issued subsidies according to the allocation principles.</p>

<h3>Telecommunications Q&amp;A Shanghai Telecommunications Bureau</h3>
<p>[Fuyou Road Dacheng Clothing Store asks] Our keyboard is often damaged, causing dialing errors. After your bureau sent someone to check, they said there was no problem. Why?</p>
<p>[Answer] The cable of an automatic telephone depends entirely on the rotation of the dial. Therefore, the speed at which the dial returns is closely related to the mechanical action. Users often help the dial to return by hand after dialing, so the key action cannot be accurate and problems occur. We hope that when you dial, use your right index finger to press the dial into the finger hole according to the desired number to the copper hook, and then remove your finger, allowing it to return on its own. Never speed up or slow down the return, so as to avoid damage to the keys or incorrect wiring.</p>
<p>[Mr. Gu Decheng of Linsen Middle Road asks] I went to Sinan Road to send a telegram, but because it was past 5 o'clock, I needed to send it to the main business office, which was very inconvenient. It is said that international telegrams are still accepted as usual there between 5 o'clock and 6:30, but I don't know why?</p>
<p>[Answer] The Sinan Road branch is a mixed office of our bureau and the international radio station. In view of the fact that there are fewer domestic telegrams sent there, the business hours are temporarily set to 5 PM. We have now ordered the branch to be lengthened to 6:30 starting from the 18th of this month, which is the same as the business hours of the international radio station, in order to facilitate the public.</p>

<p>Literature and History</p>
<h3>The Ten Circuit Inspectors During the Reign of Emperor Zhongzong of Tang</h3>
<p>— Tang Lan</p>
<p>The Tang History, Chronicle of Zhongzong, in the second year of Shenlong, has:</p>
<p>"In the second month, Yiwei, Minister of the Ministry of Justice, Wei Juyuan, along with the Zhongshu Menxia, became a three-rank official. Ten envoys were sent to inspect customs."</p>
<p>This record is slightly different in the New Tang History, Chronicle of Zhongzong. Yue Cheng "Bingshen, envoys were sent to inspect customs." The Treatise on Documents, volume 61, under the heading of "Inspectors, Investigators, Governors, and Other Envoys," states:</p>
<p>"In the second year of Shenlong, an edict was issued for twenty officials of the left and right wings and of the inner and outer fifth rank or above, who were knowledgeable and clear, and who would not yield, to be divided into ten circuit inspectors, rotating every two years, to honestly inspect the prefectures and counties."</p>
<p>This is somewhat more detailed.</p>
<p>The system of circuit inspectors during the Tang Dynasty probably originated in the eighth year of Zhenguan during the reign of Emperor Taizong. The Comprehensive Mirror in Aid of Governance, volume 194, states:</p>
<p>"The Emperor wanted to send senior officials as grand examiners to the circuits, but had not found the right people. Li Jing recommended Wei Zheng. The Emperor said: 'Zheng warns me of my faults, and cannot be separated from my side for a single day.' Therefore, he ordered Jing, along with Xiao Yu, the Minister of the Court of Imperial Sacrifices, and others, a total of thirteen people, to travel throughout the land, observe whether the chief clerks were virtuous or not, inquire about the people's hardships, show courtesy to the elderly, provide relief to the poor, commend the good, and promote those who were delayed, so that wherever the envoys went, it would be as if the Emperor had witnessed it himself."</p>
<p>The Old Tang History, Chronicle of Taizong, and Chronicle of Gaozu, mention these thirteen people, only saying that they "were sent to the four directions to observe the customs." The Treatise on Documents, volume 61, under the heading of "Examiners," states: "In the eighth year of Zhenguan, eighteen circuit grand examiners were dispatched." But this event says "eighteen circuits," which is probably a mistake. Examiners were actually circuit inspectors, which the Tang people often confused. However, at that time there were only ten circuits, so it was also simply called the "Ten Circuit Envoys," as in the New Tang History, Biography of Su Wei, "requesting the dismissal of the Ten Circuit Envoys," while thirteen people were sent in the eighth year of Zhenguan, and it is not known how they were distributed.</p>
<p>The Comprehensive Mirror in Aid of Governance, volume 208, states regarding the ten circuit inspectors during the Shenlong period:</p>
<p>"Twenty officials of the left and right wings and of the inner and outer fifth rank or above were selected as ten circuit inspectors to examine officials and pacify the people, recommend the virtuous and rectify injustices, and rotate every two years, examining their merits and demerits to advance or retreat them. Jiang Shidu of Weiren, the prefect of Yizhou, Ma Huaisu, a staff member of the Ministry of Rites, Yuan Ganxu of Linzhang, an imperial censor, Lu Huaishen of Lingchang, an investigating censor, and Li Jie of Fuyang, a junior minister of the Court of Imperial Insignia, all participated." The Old Tang History, Biography of Ma Huaisu, states:</p>
<p>"He was repeatedly transferred to the position of staff member of the Ministry of Rites, and along with Yuan Ganxu, Lu Huaishen, Li Jie, and others, served as the ten circuit examiners."</p>
<p>Jiang Shidu is not mentioned. But even according to what the Comprehensive Mirror says, only five people are pointed out. Recently, while reading Tang history, I have also examined several other people, which are recorded below.</p>
<p>1. Jiang Shidu The New Tang History, Biography, states:</p>
<p>"He was also the inspector of the Hebei Circuit and the envoy in charge of military supplies for the branch."</p>
<p>The Biography of Xiao Song also states:</p>
<p>"Jiang Shidu, the examiner of Hebei, appointed him as a judge."</p>
<p>2. Ma Huaisu The New Tang History, Biography, states:</p>
<p>"He was transferred to the position of staff member of the Ministry of Rites, and as the envoy of the ten circuits, he examined Jiangxi."</p>
<p>3. Yuan Ganxu The New Tang History, Biography, states:</p>
<p>"During the Shenlong period, as an imperial censor, he examined Jiangdong."</p>
<p>4. Lu Huaishen The New Tang History, Biography, only says that he "was promoted to imperial censor during the Shenlong period... and transferred to the position of censor of the Right Censorate." He may have served as an envoy in the capacity of a censor, but it is not known where he went.</p>
<p>5. Li Jie The New Tang History, Biography, states:</p>
<p>"During the Shenlong period, he was the examiner of the Hebei Circuit."</p>
<p>6. Ni Ruoshui The New Tang History, Biography, states:</p>
<p>"He was selected as a successful candidate in the imperial examination and repeatedly promoted to the position of supervisory censor of the Right Censorate, examining the Jiannan Circuit."</p>
<p>7. Lu Congyuan The New Tang History, Biography, states:</p>
<p>"He was transferred to the position of supervisory censor and served as the inspector and pacification envoy of the Shannan Circuit."</p>
<p>8. Hou Lingde The New Tang History, Biography of Li Shangyin, states:</p>
<p>"During the Shenlong period, Hou Lingde, the censor of the Left Censorate, served as the examiner of the Guannei Circuit. Shangyin assisted him, and because of his outstanding performance, he was promoted to supervisory censor of the Left Censorate."</p>
<p>9. Lu Jingqian The New Tang History, Biography of Li Suli, states:</p>
<p>"The examiner Lu Jingqian recommended him for his integrity."</p>
<p>The Old Tang History, Biography of Yin Sizhen, states:</p>
<p>"At the beginning of the Shenlong period, he was the Minister of the Court of Judicature... and was sent out to serve as the prefect of Qingzhou... Lu Jingqian, the inspector of Weizhou, arrived in the prefecture in August."</p>
<p>The Collection of Inscriptions on Metal and Stone, volume 68, "Wei Wen by Lu Gongqing," states:</p>
<p>"In the first year of Shenlong... he was changed to the magistrate of Rongyang County... Lu Jingqian, the inspector of the Henan Circuit and the chief clerk of Weizhou, reported his exceptional political skills."</p>
<p>Here are a total of nine people, and the places they went to include: Hebei, Jiangxi, Jiangdong, Hedong, Jiannan, Shannan, Guannei, and Henan, for a total of eight places. Only Lu Huaishen's destination is still unknown.</p>
<p>The original ten circuits at the beginning were:</p>
<p>1. Guannei, 2. Henan, 3. Hedong, 4. Hebei, 5. Shannan, 6. Longyou, 7. Huainan, 8. Jiangnan, 9. Jiannan, 10. Lingnan.</p>
<p>See the Geography Treatise. However, the circuit examiners during the Shenlong period also had Jiangdong and Jiangxi, which is very strange.</p>
<p>The Song Lian inscription on the Wurenxu Qieling Preface, reprinted by the Palace Museum last year, states:</p>
<p>"During the Longxing period of the Great Tang Dynasty, Lian asked about the counties, and there was a Ping Hou Sixian, the circuit examiner of the Jiangdong Circuit, who was from the Ding family of Yanguo, and whose canopy covered the capital."</p>
<p>When I wrote the postscript, because there was no Jiangdong Circuit during the Tang Dynasty, I said that "East is a mistake for South," and because the Xiang postscript was written as "Jiangdong South Circuit," I suspected that it was a "mistake for Jiangnan East Circuit." Now I know that not only was there Jiangdong, but there was also Jiangxi, which shows that one should not easily make judgments when reading ancient books without collecting all the evidence.</p>
<p>The "Ping" in "Ping Hou Sixian" is probably a surname. He was the circuit examiner of the Jiangdong Circuit, but according to the New Tang History quoted above, Yuan Ganxu examined Jiangdong. Then, there were at least two examiners in the Jiangdong Circuit. I suspect that the character "Da" (Great) in "Da Shi" (Grand Envoy) is somewhat related. According to the Comprehensive Mirror in Aid of Governance and the Treatise on Documents, the envoys at that time had to be officials of the fifth rank or above, but Yuan Ganxu's official rank was only from the seventh rank, while Hou Lingde, the censor of the Left Censorate, who was the examiner of the Guannei Circuit, was acting in the capacity of a censor of the fourth rank. Therefore, Ping Sixian's rank may have been higher and he was a Grand Envoy, while Yuan Ganxu was his assistant, just as Li Shangyin was Hou Lingde's assistant. The New Tang History, Biography of Song Wuguang, states after the memorial to the Emperor on the great flood in the first year of Shenlong:</p>
<p>"Soon, he was sent as an imperial censor to inspect the Henan Circuit."</p>
<p>It can be seen that the Henan Circuit also had two people, Lu Jingqian and Song Wuguang. Then, in addition to the nine people mentioned above, three people, Ping Sixian, Li Shangyin, and Song Wuguang, can be added to the twenty people during the Shenlong period, so that twelve people can be examined.</p>
<p>The New Tang History, Biography of Xi Yu, states:</p>
<p>"Four times as an envoy, he traveled the Jiangnan, Jiangdong, Huainan, and Hebei Circuits." It seems that Jiangdong and Jiangnan are different. Then, although it was said to be "Ten Circuit Envoys" during the Shenlong period, Jiangdong, Jiangxi, and other circuits were actually separated, and were outside the ten circuits set during the Zhenguan period. I think this may have something to do with the thirteen envoys sent in the eighth year of Zhenguan, and I hope there will be other new evidence.</p>
<h3>Li Gou and Mencius</h3>
<p>— Qi Xia</p>
<p>During the Northern Song Dynasty, scholars and officials in Jiangnan West Circuit, such as Ouyang Xiu, Li Gou, and Wang Anshi, all focused on the system of institutions and successively proposed some reform proposals for the politics of the time. These people were born in the same time and place, and their academic thoughts and political views were naturally easily influenced by each other. Mr. Hu Shi wrote an article on Li Gou's thoughts twenty years ago, in which he mentioned this matter, especially saying that many of the new laws implemented by Wang Anshi were extremely in line with Li Guan's propositions, so there must be a relationship of origin between them.</p>
<p>However, there were also differences in their thoughts and opinions. For example, Li and Wang's attitudes towards Mencius and Buddhism were very different.</p>
<p>Wang Anshi had quite a few exchanges with monks at that time. In his collection, there are still no less than thirty or forty poems dedicated to Master An, Baojue, and the monk Daosheng. He did not have a single text severely criticizing Buddhism, and in his later years, he lived in seclusion in Jinling, traveling in the mountains and rivers. Not only did he have more frequent exchanges with monks, but he also converted the garden house where he lived into a monastery, and donated a part of his private land to the Taiping Xingguo Temple in Jiangshan. In Li Gou's collection, however, articles criticizing Buddhism can be seen everywhere. He said that Buddhists "widely occupy fertile fields and profit houses, wear warm clothes and eat their fill, and talk emptily to deceive foolish believers." He also said that they "are not among the four classes of people," and that they "have no father and no ruler, combining the evils of Yang Zhu and Mozi," and should be strictly prohibited. This was very different from Wang Anshi.</p>
<p>Wang Anshi greatly admired Mencius. Many examples can be found simply from his poems. For example, in his poem in response to Ouyang Xiu, he said: "If I can glimpse Mencius in the future, how dare I hope for Han Yu in my whole life." He also wrote a poem with the title "Mencius": "Sunk souls and floating spirits cannot be summoned, but reading the remaining books makes one hope for his demeanor. Why be afraid that the world considers him eccentric, for there is such a person to comfort the lonely." However, Li Gou was a person known to all as "not liking Mencius."</p>
<p>Since the Northern Song Dynasty, many people have recorded Li Gou's "dislike of Mencius" in writing. Wang Cheng's "Dongdu Shilei" 114, Biography of Li Gou, states:</p>
<p>He never liked Mencius, thinking that Confucius respected the king, while Mencius taught the feudal lords to be kings. He once took the imperial examination, and could not get one of the six essays right, saying, "I have never not read the books, it must be the annotations and commentaries on Mencius." He threw down his pen and left, and people checked it for him, and it was indeed so. In the end, he did not pass the examination. Chao Gongwu's "Junzhai Dushu Zhi" also recorded this matter under Li's "Xu Jiang Ji," and the text was almost the same as in "Dongdu Shilei." The text says:</p>
<p>Gou was from Xujiang. He once took the imperial examination, and could not get one of the six essays right, saying, "I have never not read the books, it must be the annotations and commentaries on Mencius." He threw down his pen and left, and people checked it for him, and it was indeed so. Then he failed the examination and returned home. Chen Zhensun's "Zhaizhai Shulu Jieti" also records this matter:</p>
<p>Taibo did not like Mencius, and often spoke exclusively against him. He once took the examination for eminent talent and did not pass. It is said that in the cabinet examination, there were essay topics that he did not remember the source of at all, saying, "This must be an annotation on Mencius." He threw down his pen and left.</p>
<p>It is also recorded in Luo Dajing's "Helin Yulu":</p>
<p>Li Taibo wrote "Changyu" against Mencius. Later, he took the examination for eminent talent, and the essay topic was "When the classics are correct, the common people prosper." He did not know the source and said, "I have read all the books, this must be a saying in Mencius." He threw down his pen and left. In the "Daoshan Qinghua," whose author is unknown, there is an even more interesting story:</p>
<p>Li Gou, styled Taibo, was from Xujiang. He was virtuous and had literary talent, and many officials greatly respected him. He did not like Buddhism or Mencius; he liked to drink wine and write articles; his ancient prose was excellent. One day, a high official sent him several dou of wine, and Taibo's home-brewed wine was also ready. However, he was solitary and did not associate with people. A scholar knew that he must have wine, but had no way to get a drink, so he wrote several poems scolding Mencius, one of which said: "Whether the warehouse will be emptied or the stairs will be abandoned is not yet known, Mencius's talk about benevolence is also foolish; the father-in-law still wants to be the emperor, why did the son-in-law kill his younger brother?" Li was very happy to see the poem and kept him for several days. All they talked about was scolding Mencius. Before long, the wine ran out, and he left. Later, there was another person who sent wine, and the scholar heard about it and came again, writing three articles on righteousness, mostly criticizing Buddhism. Li read them and smiled, saying, "Your writing is very strange. But I was very lonely after you drank all the wine last time; I dare not keep you this time, I will keep this wine for my own comfort." Everyone who heard this burst into laughter.</p>
<p>Since the stories of Li's opposition to Mencius were so widely circulated, their truthfulness should be beyond doubt. From Li's own "Changyu," we can also see the intensity of his opposition to Mencius. There is a saying in "Changyu":</p>
<p>...How can it be said that "Confucius's teachings were not passed down"? That Mencius, who nominally studied Confucius but actually betrayed him, how could he have passed them down? May I ask what that means? Confucius's way is that the ruler is the ruler and the subject is the subject; Mencius's way is that everyone can be a ruler. When the world is without a king, those who are domineering speak falsely and debate endlessly without being killed, so that the philosophers can carry out their intentions. The wisdom of Sun Wu, the deceit of Su Qin and Zhang Yi, and the benevolence and righteousness of Mencius have different origins, but they are the same in that they disrupt the world. There is also a saying:</p>
<p>Mencius said: "The Five Hegemons are the sinners of the Three Kings." I think Mencius is the sinner of the Five Hegemons. The Five Hegemons led the feudal lords to serve the Zhou Dynasty. Anyone with humanity must know what is right and wrong. Mencius lived during the reign of King Xian of Zhou, and after another hundred years, the Qin annexed the Zhou. Alas! He was so cruel that he regarded the Zhou royal family as if it did not exist. There are also many words of disparagement of Mencius scattered throughout other articles, for example:</p>
<p>"Mencius considers himself benevolent, but I know that he is extremely unbenevolent."</p>
<p>"Believing in Mencius and not believing in the classics is like believing in others and not believing in one's parents."</p>
<p>"I think the world can do without Mencius, but it cannot do without the Six Classics."</p>
<p>He criticized Mencius's theories and his character so much that, as Yu Yunwen said in the preface to "Zun Meng Bian," "He criticized him to the core."</p>
<p>The words in Li's "Changyu" quoted above are not found in the currently circulating collection of Li's writings. I quoted them from "Zun Meng Bian." The reason why these passages are not found in the current edition of Li's collection is that the compilers of the Siku Quanshu in the Qing Dynasty thought that they had been deleted by those who edited this collection in later generations. The summary of the Xujiang Ji in the general catalog of the Siku Quanshu states:</p>
<p>According to Li Gou's chronology: In the third year of Qingli (Guiwei, 1043), he compiled the twelve-volume "Tuiju Leigao," and in the fourth year of Huangyou (Gengchen, 1052), he compiled the eight-volume "Huangyou Xugao." This collection was compiled by Zuo Zan of Nancheng in the Ming Dynasty, and contains thirty-seven volumes of poetry, prose, and miscellaneous writings, with a chronology of one volume at the beginning, and an outer collection of three volumes containing imperial edicts and recommendation chapters. It is probably not the old version of that time. People in the Song Dynasty often said that Gou did not like Mencius. Yu Yunwen's "Zun Meng Bian" contains seventeen articles from Gou's "Changyu," but this collection only contains three articles about Confucius's disciples disregarding the affairs of Duke Huan and Duke Wen, and Yi Yin deposing Taijia and the Duke of Zhou enfeoffing Lu. It is said that Zan concealed and deleted them. The preface to "Tuiju Leigao" by Zu Wuzhe at the beginning of the collection specifically compares Mencius to Gou; and the letter to Li Guan in the collection says: "The theories of Mencius, Xun Kuang, and Yang Xiong cannot be lightly assessed"; other articles in the collection also quote Mencius quite a bit, which is contrary to the various records of people in the Song Dynasty. Judging from the deleted "Changyu," could it be that Zan has tampered with it?</p>

<h3>The Year Yang Guifei Became a Daoist</h3>
<p>— Chen Yuan</p>
<p>The "Tang Da Zhaoling Ji" forty has three documents regarding Yang Guifei:</p>
<p>1.  The text for conferring Yang Xuan's daughter as the Consort of Prince Shou. The twenty-fourth day of the twelfth month of Yihai in the twenty-third year of Kaiyuan.</p>
<p>2.  The text for conferring Wei Zhaoxun's daughter as the Consort of Prince Shou. The twenty-sixth day of the seventh month of Yixi in the fourth year of Tianbao.</p>
<p>3.  The edict for ordaining Prince Shou's Consort Yang as a female Daoist. The month and day at the bottom should be the second day of the first month of the twenty-ninth year of Kaiyuan.</p>
<p>Zhu Zhuti's "Shushi Ji" fifty-five has "After reading the Biography of Yang Taizhen," saying that the Consort entered the palace as a virgin. His explanation of the text conferring the Consort in the twenty-third year of Kaiyuan, according to the "Kaiyuan Li," is that when a Prince marries a consort, it involves accepting betrothal gifts, asking for a name, accepting auspicious omens, accepting tributes, and requesting a date for the wedding. All of these require divination, and there is no ceremony of accepting betrothal gifts, being conferred, and immediately returning to the Prince Shou's residence.</p>
<p>Now, examining "Tongdian" 129 on the imperial body, the consorts of princes receive their rank after the request of a date and before the personal reception. The reception follows immediately after the reception and cannot be based on this to say that the Consort did not return to Prince Shou's residence.</p>
<p>His explanation of the edict for becoming a Daoist is based on the sentence "belonging to the anniversary of the Empress Dowager's death," saying that the Empress Dowager was Emperor Xuanzong's birth mother, Empress Zhaocheng, who received the imperial seal on the second day of the first month of Changshou year two. Empress Wu used the Jianzi month as the beginning of the year. According to "Ceifu Yuangui" twenty-three, the first year of Yongchu was only changed to the second day of the eleventh month as the anniversary. During the Kaiyuan period, they still followed the old custom, so the date of the Consort becoming a Daoist should be the second day of the first month. His saying is very precise.</p>
<p>However, to think it was in the first month of the twenty-fifth year of Kaiyuan is because Empress Wu Hui had not yet passed away at that time. Empress Wu Hui's death was on Bingwu in the twelfth month of the twenty-fifth year of Kaiyuan. The old Jiulu, the new Jilu, and Tongjian 214 are all the same. Ceifu Yuangui three says it was the seventh day of the twelfth month. The seventh day is Bingwu, and the first day of the month was Gengzi.</p>
<p>Old Tang Book 51, Biography of Empress Hui, and Old Tang Book 107, Biography of Prince Shou, also say it was the twenty-fifth year. Only Old Tang Book, Biography of Empress Yang, says it was the twenty-fourth year Empress Hui died, and New Tang Book, Biography of Empress Yang, followed it, and deleted the year of Empress Hui's death in the Biography of Empress Hui in order to unify them. But they did not know that the Benji still said it was the twenty-fifth year. This is because the biographies and benji were not written by the same person.</p>
<p>Zhu Zhuti based his argument on the Biography of Empress Yang and pushed Empress Yang's entry into Daoism to the twenty-fifth year of Kaiyuan, which is actually too early. And if she really had not returned to Prince Shou's residence, then how could the anniversary of the Empress Dowager's death relate to an unmarried consort? This cannot be defended.</p>
<p>Zhang Shizhai's "Yishu Waibian" three, Bingchen Zhaji, is contrary to Zhu Zhuti's saying, stating that in the twenty-third year of Kaiyuan, the Empress was appointed as Prince Shou's Consort. The Empress was only seventeen years old. In the fourth year of Tianbao, there was an imperial order for Prince Shou's Consort Yang to become a Daoist, so Empress Yang had been in Prince Shou's residence for ten years.</p>
<p>I do not know what Zhang Shizhai based his claim that it was the fourth year of Tianbao when the edict for becoming a Daoist had no month or year. It seems rather arbitrary. His idea is that becoming a Daoist and being appointed as a Noble Consort both happened in the same year. He does not know that becoming a Daoist and being appointed as a Noble Consort have different purposes. Before being appointed as a Noble Consort, she could enter the palace first, but before leaving Prince Shou's residence, she could not be taken into the palace. Becoming a Daoist was to formally sever her relationship with Prince Shou's residence. After Empress Hui's death in the twenty-fifth year, the Emperor urgently sought a person to his liking. Having found someone to his liking, how could he wait until the fourth year of Tianbao? Therefore, Zhang Shizhai's estimation of the year Yang Guifei became a Daoist is too late.</p>
<p>So in what year did Yang Guifei become a Daoist? It is recorded in the new Ji for the year of Kaiyuan twenty-eight, under the entry for the tenth month Jiazhi, that the Emperor visited the Hot Springs Palace and then wrote "made Prince Shou's consort, Yang, a Taoist nun, titled Taizhen." Comparing this with the old records, it is known that this entry was added by the new record, and Tongjian did not record it either. What is the basis for the new record? It is based on the "Biography of Taizhen."</p>
<p>The "Biography of Taizhen" says: In the eleventh month of the twenty-second year of Kaiyuan, she returned to Prince Shou's residence. In the tenth month of the twenty-eighth year, Emperor Xuanzong visited the Hot Springs Palace and ordered Gao Lishi to take Yang from Prince Shou's residence and ordained her as a female Daoist, titled Taizhen. Zhu Zhuti considers this to be hearsay and does not believe the saying that she had returned to Prince Shou's residence.</p>
<p>Le Shi saw in the Song Shi 306 that he lived in the early Northern Song Dynasty, and his words should have a basis. The eleventh month of the twenty-second year is an error in the current version of the outer biography, as the month and year of the imperial edict can prove. However, taking Yang from Prince Shou's residence and ordaining her as a female Daoist may not have happened at the same time. According to the edict for becoming a Daoist, it clearly states that she was ordained because of the anniversary of the Empress Dowager's death, so becoming a female Daoist should have been on the second day of the first month of the following year. Since the new Ji took the Outer Biography, it should have recorded the event in the first month of the twenty-ninth year, and not in the tenth month of the twenty-eighth year.</p>
<p>Free Talk</p>
<h3>The End of March Has Passed</h3>
<p>— Ping Zhai</p>
<p>Today is April 1st, and I have carefully read this newspaper's local news, paying more attention than usual. Why? Because the April 1st newspaper publishes the events that occurred on March 31st, and I have a special interest in what happened on that particular day at the end of March in Shanghai.</p>
<p>Isn't the end of March the deadline for half of Shanghai's dance halls to close down?</p>
<p>However, there is no news about these dance halls closing down in the April 1st newspaper. I am not surprised; on the contrary, I would find it a great surprise if the dance halls really closed down as scheduled.</p>
<p>Several of the Shanghai city councilors are acquaintances whom I meet every day. Therefore, during the most recent city council meeting, I happened to turn on the radio to listen to the proceedings. I originally wanted to hear the speeches of the councilors I knew, but instead, I heard a discussion about the dance ban issue, specifically the speech of Director Wu Kaixian of the Social Affairs Bureau. I don't remember many of the things he said that day, but a few sentences made a particularly deep impression on me, so I still remember them very clearly. From these sentences, I had already anticipated that the April 1st newspaper might not have any "lottery-winning dance halls closing" news. He said: "My attitude is: if the central government does not urge me to handle this matter by the deadline, I will definitely not execute it automatically." At that time, several of the councilors were quite agitated. Because the council had already resolved to oppose the dance ban, but the government ignored it, they proposed a new motion with very impolite wording. Director Wu advised them about this motion, saying: "Please don't provoke the central government too much..." To be fair, Director Wu's tone that day was a bit overly cautious, but it was indeed quite sincere, and his words did take the overall situation into consideration to some extent.</p>
<p>Perhaps the grandiose dance ban will just be ignored? The unfortunate ones are the doors, windows, teacups, tables, and chairs of the Social Affairs Bureau.</p>
<p>I never dance, but I never oppose others dancing either – and I absolutely and resolutely oppose the dance ban. I believe that since the dance industry is a legal business, then the government's dance ban is wrong. Secondly, I believe that the savings achieved from the dance ban are not significant, while the resulting unemployment problem is very serious. The incident of dance industry workers smashing the Social Affairs Bureau may have been caused by a few ambitious individuals attempting to create a "tragedy," but it was the officials who suddenly had the strange idea of banning dancing who sowed the seeds of instability in Shanghai, giving these ambitious individuals something to exploit!</p>
<p>I also admire those who are simply headstrong to the end, because at least they mean what they say, and their orders are carried out, which demonstrates efficiency and prestige. However, in a democratic country, the public opinion of the people cannot be completely ignored. We individuals should pay attention to "being able to pick up and put down" and to "not hesitating to correct mistakes" in our dealings with the world, and the government should do the same. Even Roosevelt often encountered opposition from Congress during wartime, and if public opinion did not want him to do something, he could only accept it. Since our officials seem to lack the courage to urge the Shanghai Social Affairs Bureau to implement the dance ban – then why not simply abolish the dance ban altogether and at least earn the reputation of respecting public opinion?</p>
<p>First, they repeatedly issued orders to ban dancing, completely ignoring the representations of the public opinion organs. Then, when something happened, they didn't dare to be truly stubborn to the end. However, they were too embarrassed to publicly admit that they had been a bit frivolous, so after racking their brains, they finally came up with a policy of "opening one eye and closing the other," and the local government responded with "playing dumb." After admiring this, we common people feel both angry and amused!</p>
<h3>Jiangsu Has Abundant Water</h3>
<p>— Hong Xian</p>
<p>The name of Jiangsu Province contains the character "Jiang" (江), meaning river. There are many rivers and lakes in the province, and its border faces the sea to the east. The names of the counties in the province are mostly derived from water. These can be classified into four categories:</p>
<p>(1) Counties named directly or indirectly after the sea: Donghai, Haimen, Haian, Shanghai.</p>
<p>(2) Counties named directly or indirectly after rivers: Songjiang, Wujiang, Jiangyin, Zhenjiang, Jiangning, Jiangpu, Huaiyin, Huaian, Jingjiang, Lishui, Liyang, Jiangdu, Lianshui, Siyang, Shuyang.</p>
<p>(3) Counties named directly or indirectly after lakes: Baoying, Gaoyou.</p>
<p>(4) Other counties with water-related names: Peixian, Guanyun, Yancheng, Yangzhou, Gaochun, Qingpu, Nanhui, Chuansha.</p>
<p>The above four categories comprise twenty-nine counties, which account for almost half of the counties in Jiangsu.</p>
<h3>The Taste of Middle Age</h3>
<p>— Shuang Lu</p>
<p>The ancients said: "Life is like a white colt glimpsed through a crack." But according to my personal experience, this may only apply to the stage from youth to old age. In youth, you just use your parent's money, feel there's more good times than you can live. In younger years, I was single, what I earned was enough for myself, even after marriage, still didn't have children, life was still passable, I still had some leeway to engage in flights of fancy. When a person has the leisure to dream, they will never feel life is difficult. But now as I reach middle age, I am forced to live practically and constantly preoccupied with the cost of living, without leeway to think, without leeway to avoid it, and without realizing it, the years go by.</p>
<p>Occasionally, I run into a classmate from middle school, we all have more wrinkles on our foreheads, our chins are jowly. If I encounter a few attractive young ladies, I might well think I can befriend them, yet they already think of me as belonging to the older generation, and call me uncle uncle, do I still have the courage to befriend them? My mood for excitement has diminished, I would rather quietly flip through old books. I can still see the child star Shirley Temple's movies right before my eyes, but the newspaper says that Shirley Temple not only is married, but already is a mother to a child. At those little moments, you will be astonished by the speed of time, and awaken to the fact that you have entered middle age. But the things of youth are still fresh in my mind, and when I think of the ancients' simile of "a white horse glimpsed through a crack", how can one not sigh ruefully!</p>
<p>People such as ourselves in our 30's, if we assume that "seventy years is rare from ancient times", it seems that we are already on the downward slope of our life journey, in our younger years we once had great ambitions, and had ambition, now we realize that we aren't cut from that cloth, and reality also makes it so you can't violate it, to ponder over it makes for the so called "tragedy of fate". Life is like exploration, enduring hardship is the support of future daydreams, now that we have a rough idea of the end of the journey, the exploration doesn't have much meaning, how many can give up and turn around?</p>
<p>Yet middle age has its benefits, too, books that we read formerly we often did not seek to understand to the greatest extent, or we were not able to really grasp them, now with an increase in knowledge, we are naturally able to solve the problems, or be able to recognize things more completely than in our youth. We can't help but say that it's a benefit of getting older.</p>
<p>Proficiency in human affairs is, mostly, a thing of middle age, until it reaches the right heat, it can't be pure and skilled. In our younger years, we easily trusted people, were easily moved to emotion, spoke with no room to turn around, and liked to criticize people, and in the end we reaped the losses for it, when I think about it, it's simply the work of an idiot. But what's gone is gone, going forward we won't repeat our mistakes, when I think of this, there's a lot of consolation, too.</p>
<p>When you get a little older, you see a little more, you hear a little more, you taste a little more personally, life is just watching people perform plays, and performing plays for people to watch, when you meet people and talk about plays, you're actually able to talk like a family, or have played every role, aren't those pleasures?</p>
<p>All this is a benefit of middle age, outside of sorrow there are also things to be happy about.</p>
<p>Westerners have a saying, "Life begins at forty", this statement is very true, to have good dreams is of course joyful, if you have bad dreams, at least you can understand a little taste of the dreams. If the dreams you had before forty were not very good, then why not start again at forty, and dream once more? If you can penetrate the logic of it, then life begins at forty is of course all right, but starting at fifty, sixty is also fine? If you can not have the worst ideas, and grasp some good states from reality, that is close to being an enlightened person, and close to being a god or immortal.</p>
<h3>Last Will</h3>
<p>— Li Li</p>
<p>In the 19th century, Canadian Denlope made a will before his death:</p>
<p>—I bequeath five acres of land to my eldest sister, Joan, to comfort her for marrying a husband "dominated by Lanway."</p>
<p>—Give the small house on the edge of the land to my second sister, Sally. It seems that no one will marry her, and this small house is enough for her to use alone.</p>
<p>—Give my big Bible to my third sister, Katie. She can learn to be a good person from the words she knows.</p>
<p>—Give a large silver snuffbox to my brother James, so that he will know when he should get up.</p>
<p>—Give my best pipe to my brother-in-law Christopher, to show my gratitude to him for marrying my sister Meggie, who any man of taste would shake his head at.</p>
<h3>The Inspiration of Cars</h3>
<p>— Yi Jun</p>
<p>I saw this sentence in an educational test book: "For four- or five-year-old children living in the city, the test question 'Who is faster, a car or a tram?' may be an effective intelligence test, but it is not suitable for children in the countryside." I, a 24- or 25-year-old adult in the city, cannot even answer this question, so my stupidity is evident. This happened the summer before last. But since then, I have often paid attention: Which is faster, a tram or a car?</p>
<p>After nearly two years of observation, I found that most of the time, cars always overtook trams like arrows. Only rarely did trams appear to be faster.</p>
<p>Therefore, I further studied the reasons. It turns out that trams have tracks (although trackless trams have no tracks under the wheels, they are still inseparable from the overhead wires, which is equivalent to having tracks). So when moving, if the road ahead is blocked by traffic, the tram itself is limited by the tracks and cannot freely overtake, so it has to drive slowly, and even stop. This is one reason. Even if there are few people and vehicles ahead and there are no obstacles, driving too fast risks derailment, so it cannot be fast. This is the second reason. Cars, on the other hand, are not limited by tracks, so they have plenty of freedom. If one place is blocked, they can go to another place, dashing around as they please, so naturally they are faster. However, trams may be slow, but there are fewer accidents. Cars may be fast, but there are more chances of accidents.</p>
<p>Therefore, I got an inspiration. The absence of freedom hinders one's own progress; unrestrained freedom easily infringes on the safety of others. The freedom we should strive for is full personal freedom that does not harm others. Only such freedom is worthy of saying: "Life is precious, love is more valuable; but for the sake of freedom, both can be abandoned."</p>
<h3>Terrible Adaptation</h3>
<p>— Ye Gong</p>
<p>We humans are the best at adapting. First, let's talk about the eyes. When we first walk into a pitch-black movie theater from the bright daylight, our eyes are blinded and we can't see anything. After a while, our vision recovers and we can see our neighbors on either side, whether it is a man with a full beard or a beautiful young woman. The eyes have adapted to the darkness.</p>
<p>Next, let's talk about the ears. When we first move from the quiet countryside to a noisy city, we feel really irritated and uneasy, but after a few days, we become deaf to it and go about our business as if nothing had happened. The ears have adapted to the noise.</p>
<p>Third, let's talk about the nose. When we first enter a place that sells dried abalone, the fishy and stinky smell makes us nauseous, but strangely, we don't smell the stink after a while. The nose has adapted to the rotten smell.</p>
<p>Fourth, let's talk about the mouth. When we first tell a lie or say something base and vulgar, we blush and stammer, but after a few times, you will consider lying an art and scolding people a talent. The mouth has adapted to deception and curses.</p>
<p>Fifth, let's talk about the hands. When we first pick up a knife to kill someone, our hands will be soft and our courage will be weak. After killing too many people, it will be difficult to live without killing. The hands have adapted to the bloody cruelty.</p>
<p>Sixth, let's talk about the conscience. When we first have evil thoughts, we can't help but be cautious and feel lost. But ah, after a long time, the life philosophy of "I would rather betray the world than let the world betray me" is formed. The conscience has adapted to cruelty.</p>
<p>Ah, terrible adaptation!</p>
<h3>The Resistance of Air</h3>
<p>— Ruzi</p>
<p>The German philosopher Kant once said: The difficulty that a pigeon flying in the air must overcome is the resistance of the air. The ignorant pigeon may think that if the air is removed, it will fly faster and more comfortably. Little does it know that if the air is really removed and the pigeon flies in a vacuum, the pigeon will immediately fall to the ground and be unable to fly. Air is the resistance to the pigeon's flight, but without the resistance of air, the pigeon cannot fly. From this, it can be seen that without suffering, without obstacles, without difficulties, great undertakings cannot be accomplished.</p>
<h3>The Magic in the Ordinary</h3>
<p>— Leng Leng</p>
<p>The great French painter Claude Monet often set out at dawn, taking with him his lunchbox, painting tools, canvas, etc., to the countryside. He sat in front of a haystack—an utterly ordinary haystack in the middle of a field—and took out his painting tools to begin painting. He painted one picture after another from morning until it got dark, then packed up and went home. All twelve paintings made in a day were of the same haystack, but as time slipped by minute by minute, the sun shone on the haystack from different angles and with different intensities. The colors displayed were far more than twelve—truly ever-changing and infinitely beautiful, filling Monet with deep satisfaction.</p>
<h3>Recent Situation of a Prodigal Son</h3>
<p>— Yongxiang</p>
<p>Mr. Xiang Kairan, known for his "Burning of the Red Lotus Temple" and other novels, the prodigal son of Pingjiang—is now old, his hair half gray, but his body is still robust. He is usually silent and does not associate much with the world, but when he meets someone he is compatible with, he can talk endlessly without showing any signs of fatigue. He often writes letters and other ordinary social correspondence under the lamp with swift strokes. His calligraphy is elegant, and he can still write small characters, showing that his eyesight is not bad.</p>
<p>He had a deep friendship with Liao Lei, the former Chairman of Anhui Province. Liao recruited him and consulted him on important government affairs within the office. When he resided in the office building, many subordinates were in awe of him. In reality, he was not a harsh person, but he rarely smiled, and subordinates were afraid of running into trouble with him.</p>
<p>He had considerable courage. When the Japanese invaders occupied Hefei, he accompanied Chairman Liao from Lihuang to eastern Anhui for inspection. While passing through the Fenan intersection in southwestern Hefei, he accompanied Liao on the lecture platform to address the people. At that time, a pair of eagles suddenly appeared in the sky, coming from afar. Traitors suddenly shouted that enemy planes were attacking, and the crowd scattered in a panic, trampling on each other and causing injuries. Only he and Liao remained standing on the platform, unmoved. Last year, the Eighth Route Army harassed Lihuang, and Xiang was arrested. Ultimately, he was able to escape from danger with his eloquence, but he lost all his life savings in that incident. Although he is from Pingjiang, Hunan, he has bought a small plot of land in Liuan and plans to buy a house in the city to live there permanently. It turns out that he likes to drink tea and is very fond of the tea from Qitou Mountain in Liuan and the water from the Yi River, feeling reluctant to leave and enjoying the place so much that he forgets his hometown of Hunan.</p>
<p>In recent years, he has liked reciting Buddhist scriptures. He can recite the Diamond Sutra and the Great Compassion Mantra flawlessly. He likes vegetarian food, and prayer beads are always in his hand. He has taken refuge in a temple in western Anhui and become a Buddhist disciple. Xiangshan Temple in Lihuang was successfully renovated under his supervision. If it had not been destroyed by the bandits, he would have wanted to lead a group of monks to hold a seven-day Buddhist retreat and build a water and land dharma assembly to deliver suffering ghosts.</p>
<p>In his youth, he was also a strong contender in the game of love. He is the person who experienced and wrote "A History of Students in the East." Now, his wife is much younger than him, and they have children around their knees, the youngest being only six or seven years old.</p>
<h3>Beyond "Knee Room"</h3>
<p>— Lei</p>
<p>A young couple went to see a very small apartment room while looking for housing. At a distance away from the landlord where their conversation couldn't be heard, the couple whispered to each other. The wife later nodded, so the husband turned back and said to the landlord, "Okay, I think we can rent it, although the room is a bit too small."</p>
<p>"I don't understand," said the landlord. "After all, this kind of apartment was designed and built for two people."</p>
<p>"Of course, that's right," said the young husband. "But you know, we hope to keep a goldfish as a pet in the room in addition to the two of us!"</p>
<h3>Carefree Flower</h3>
<p>— Chen Shenyan</p>
<p>Chapter 14: Carefree at Sea (116)</p>
<p>Zhu Zhai said, "My thinking was completely wrong before. Now I feel that our home is too good, and I can't bear to leave it." Feng Sheng said, "Don't say too much in front of me. If you really think this home is good, you wouldn't have divorced me." Zhu Zhai said, "The divorce that day was due to my temporary confusion. Now I understand completely. Please forgive me this time." Feng Sheng said, "I can forgive you, but I cannot forgive your heart. You were determined to divorce me that day because you must have had other plans in your heart. Now, the person you wanted to marry doesn't want you anymore, so you want to come back home again. Although I am a woman, I want to keep my word. I won't be fickle like you. We are already divorced, so we should follow the terms of the agreement." Zhu Zhai said, "You keep saying that you want to follow the agreement, but you should know that the divorce agreement we wrote was made privately between the two of us and is not legally valid. Furthermore, we did not announce our divorce to the outside world. Even our parents don't know about it. How can we use this piece of waste paper as a basis?" Feng Sheng said, "Then you deceived me. I can't agree to you even more." Zhu Zhai said, "There's no need to mention the past. Please forgive me and cancel the divorce certificate we made first, okay?" Feng Sheng said, "No, no. You want to trick me out of my written document, but that's impossible. Don't even think about it. The document is in my hand, and I can't give it to you no matter what." Saying that, she angrily turned around and wanted to go into the room. Zhu Zhai hurriedly said, "Feng Sheng, don't misunderstand. I didn't mean that. If you don't believe me, I have proof to show you." Saying that, he took out the letter from his pocket and handed it to Feng Sheng, saying, "You'll understand what I mean by looking at it. What is my intention for coming back this time." As soon as Feng Sheng saw that it was Yun Qing's letter, her face immediately showed a very astonished look and asked, "It's her letter." While saying that, she sat down in a chair with a thud and read Yun Qing's letter from beginning to end, then read it again. Then, staring at Zhu Zhai's face with wide eyes, she asked, "Do you mean you want to come back? I think you're better off outside." Zhu Zhai said anxiously, "Why don't you understand what I mean? I am sincere, repenting and correcting myself, asking for your forgiveness. You should know my temper. If I didn't believe Yun Qing's words, I wouldn't want to come back." Feng Sheng said, "Then you don't have to come back!"</p>
