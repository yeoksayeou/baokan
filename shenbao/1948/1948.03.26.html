<h3>國民大會的序曲　副總統競選熱烈展開</h3>
<p>第一届國民大會快揭幕了，民主政治的序幕，從這裏展開；古老的中華民國史頁，正翻開了新的一面。人們懷着喜悅和憂慮參半的情愫來迎接他。我們高興的，是在這一代，我們終竟跨到了民主政治的境域。我們憂慮的，却是這多難的家國！這雖不能算得是個奇跡，可是却讓事實吿訴我們，這是件並不平凡的事實。一個經過了八年長期抗敵戰爭以後，再連續忍受着支持着兩年餘的內亂的國度，在政治，經濟，軍事都被擾得紛亂萬分的際會，竟能不畏一切困難，推進了民主憲政的肇基。今天，中華民國憲法施行已經三個月了，我們在應得的，應享的中華民國國民的權利上，召開了第一屆國民大會。</p>
<p>國民大會的職權是選舉並罷免總統，副總統和修改憲法，可是本届國大，是行憲剛三個月後就舉行的，憲法剛剛實施，自然不能就進行修改，因此本屆國大的主題顯然只是選舉總統和副總統。</p>
<p>根據憲法的規定，總統是國家的元首，對外代表中華民國，對內統率全國陸海空軍。總統有各種決定權力，雖然若干事件需要獲得有關方面的同意；但是地位僅次於總統的副總統，在憲法上，就沒有一點具體條文的說明。我們所能瞭解的，是「當大總統行使職權時，副總統沒有任何）權」，根據憲法第四十九條所列，只在大總統缺位或因故不能視事時，方能主副總統繼任成是代行其職權。所以副總統是地位炫赫僅次於大總統，而其毫元實權將不如一部會首長。但是，在這國民大會揭幕前夕，競選副總統的熱浪，已經在首都展開了。爲什麽沒有人競選大總統？一如競選國大代表或競選立法委員監察委員，只有人競選正式當選而無人競選候補者，是什麽理由？正副代表和正副總統之比，並沒有什麽不同之處，因爲當正代表出缺時，候補代表就將總補其職位的，反之，如果正代表永遠不會缺位，那麼候補代表也就永不能遞補上去。這與副總統當大總統在職時，是永無任何職權一樣。可是在這大選的前留夕，凡有意爲國家盡力爲民服務的，都只選擇了這個虛位爲目標。這一點，明顯的說明了，全國上下一致，對現任將主席的擁戴，他們幾乎是從沒有考慮過首任大總統有必要者慮蔣主席以外的人選。記者曾經把這個問題去探詢已經說明了將作戰總統候選人的諸氏，同時，也爲此去徵求民社黨，靑年黨高級人士的意見，詢問他們對大總統人選問題。我可以說，黨內黨外，上下各色人等就沒有一個人說過一句不相同的答語二「大總統自然是蔣主席羅！」這裏面包含了很多的因素：蔣主席是領導北伐成功的領袖，蔣主席是領導抗戰而達到勝利的領袖，蔣主席是領導人民從軍政走向訓政，再走向憲政的途徑領袖，蔣主席領導了革命，文領導民主政治，蔣主席是中國史實上最有貢獻的領袖，在這行憲伊始，自然不能把手創的導師棄置於一旁。這是原因之一。</p>
<p>同時有人說，如果不選蔣主席，我們選誰？假如說，以黨讓黨，在民，靑兩黨的先進來膺選吧！可是幾乎是沒有一個人這麽想過「在其他兩黨裏有這麽一個人，他的才能，他的經驗會較將主席爲高，更能勝任這份艱鉅的任務」。在國民黨本身說，他們幾乎是每個人都是從蔣主席的薰陶之下處理他們的份內工作，他們認爲唯有聆聽蔣主席的指示才是天下最不易的至理，他們萬衆一心的相信，信任蔣主席，他們沒有作蔣主席以外的考慮。於是大總統選誰呢？誰都沒有考慮過：「當然是蔣主席！」這裏存了崇敬，也寓有酬功的意思。因爲沒有英明的蔣主席的領導，我們又何從有今天開國民大會，競選成被選舉副總統的機會啊！</p>
<p>於是，在大遷的序幕裏，大總統的人選就成了不成問題的問題。接着的就是副總統的競選，首先可以在這裏報道的是若干具有着競選熱情的希望候選人，當他們已經考慮了將進行參加競選的時候，第一下就有了一個意識「得聆聽取蔣主席的指示吧？」幾乎不論是黨內或不是黨內的，他們這種想法是基於對領袖的信任和崇敬。可是，這不過是他們的想法，蔣主席並沒有對「民主」下註脚，他並不預備統制「民主」，他給與行將參與競選者以最大的自由。於是，當這種空氣散布出去以後，副總統的競選活動才開始。</p>
<p>對於副總統的人選，身份，提名，像一股啃流似的，潛在的發展着。對於副總統的兼職，判處理論着。看來很有些可加硏討的必要，可是毅然決然的以不同方式展開了他們的競選空氣。迄至今天爲止，首都已充滿了散布着濃烈的競選空氣，副總統的茶會此起彼落，這一戰想來總是够熟烈的。記者想說的，僅就現在南京的幾位競選人，計共是五位。說文武之分吧，文有于右任·孫科，莫德惠，武有李宗仁，程潛。拿黨派來分，他們之中只有莫德惠一個人是以社會賢達的身份參加的。以籍貫地域來說吧，于。莫是北方人，其餘是南方人，但是，他們顯然各有千秋，各有其把握，他們分別在別人的擁戴或是自動自發的基點上，開始了這民主的第一課。　三月廿五日寄自首都</p>

<h3>養士與用士</h3>
<p>— 朱光潛</p>
<p>據最近統計，全國中學及專科以上學校學生領全公費者約十二萬一千四百人，領半公變者約二萬四千九百人，共計約十四萬五千餘人。公費隨物價上昇，每年共需款項數目頗難估計，而且領公費底人數也隨時變動，趨勢是有增無减。據最近一個月的情形來說。最高額全公費每名已達三百萬元左右。以學校爲單位說，公費一項有時超過全校敎職員薪貼總額，超過經常費與設備費十餘倍乃至歡十倍。以全國敎育經費爲單位說，三十六年度槪算公費總額是五百零四億，佔全部敎育經費約百分之十五；三十七年度預算公費總額約在七千三百億。約佔全部敎育經費百分之二十五。據三月十四日報戯敎育部訓令：「學生公議費一項現時每月支出將達一千億元」，則超過預算甚多。這不能說不是一筆大開支。</p>
<p>公費的設立始於抗戰初年。當時許多學校　在治亡　　，學生們或是離鄕別井，經濟來源斷絕，或是家雖近校，而受戰事影響，仍無自費就學的能力。政府爲救濟流亡與清寒底靑年，爲在戰爭中維持敎育於不擊，於是有公費的設立。在戰時經濟極端籌迫中，政府居然能作這種長遠底計算。其苦心孤詣是極可飲佩底，當時除掉培植人才以外，還另有一個用意，就是不讓下一代底中國主人稽留在淪陷區域，受敵僞的蹂躪或利用。所以公費的設立含有敎育底與政治底明稱意味，一方面是敎，一方面是養，就抗戰九年的成績看，這兩方面的成效都頗可觀：我們培植出來了一些有用底人才，也救濟了許多可能陷於敵僞佔領區底靑年。</p>
<p>抗戰勝利以後，一般家庭經濟狀况比從前更壞，公　制度不能不繼續維持。但是學生人數日漸加多，政府也日漸感覺到担負一天沉重似一天，於是從去年新生起，公費改爲獎學金，而獎學金名額限制只能佔全體新生百分二十。但是就目前說，已領公費底仍照舊續領，獎學金之外又有匪區救濟金，靑年軍復員學生公費和抗戰功勛子弟助學金等等名目，所以實際上大多數學生仍靠國家給養。這給養的目的仍如抗戰時期一樣，含有數育底培植與政治底收養兩重用意。</p>
<p>就復員後這一兩年的情形來說，公費制度對於在校靑年底影響可謂好壞參半。好是無可置疑底，敎育的命脈賴以維繫，一部份優秀淸寒子弟確實賴此在學問上有所成就。壞也在所不免，富家子第有佔住窮人子弟名額，領着公款浪費底，狡黠無賴底有跨校領雙份公費或冒領公費底，也有佔領公費視學校如旅館或療養院底，最普遍底現象是視公養爲分所應得，很少有人記得這遺是比他們自己更窮因底老百姓的血汗的代價。他們還天天在呌苦，沒有想到一般老百姓還比他們更苦。就連他們的師長在特遇上也還比不上他們。比如拿北平來說，一家四五口底敎授至多只得領一千萬稍有出頭，而一名全公費就有三百萬出頭。敎授的子女進學校還要繳費。</p>
<p>就大體說，我利多數敎育界人士的意見是一致底，在目前社會經濟狀況之下，優秀清寒子弟還必須靠國家的力量來培養，公費或獎學金制度邊要維持。但是辦法必須改良，國家培養底應僅限於優秀淸寒，我們不應拿小民脂膏無選擇而且無計劃地浪費於資助頑劣紈袴。目前底辦法所給人底印象是養多於敎，而且養也並沒有達到政府養的用意。說乾脆一點，養的用意是免得靑年學子造反。義而不敎，受養者就不免還要造反。</p>
<p>但是最嚴重底問題還不在此，而在養不能養一擊子，學生們終有畢業離校的一日。就目前實際情形說，畢業就等於失業，也就等於斷養。這一批靑年學子受過很高底敎育，都有很高底理想，一出學校，你呌他們學無所用。理想打得粉碎，你難道能期望他們很恭順地永遠站在饑餓線上不成？因此我想到蘇東坡論「戰國任俠」那一篇文眾。他說戰國養士的風氣很盛，「其力耕以奉上，皆椎魯而無能者，雖欲叛亂而草爲之先」，所以六國不速亡，秦之速亡，就由於「民之秀異者散而歸田畝」。他提出這樣一個疑問：</p>
<p>「向之食於四公子呂不韋之徒者（註：受過給養底）皆安歸（註。斷養以後）哉？不知其能稿項黄　以老死於布褐（註：窮困而死）乎？抑將　　太息以民時（註：以陳勝吳廣造反）也」！</p>
<p>這同題在現在還有它的重要性，値得講數治權謀者想一想</p>
<p>縱然丢開政治權謀不談，我們也得要問：我們花這麽多底物力與人力來培養這麼多底學生，總要有一個目的，養而不用。目的何在？失業　養，不但對靑年們自己是一個大災害，對國家社會也是一個大損失，不消說威脅，這靑年失業問題是必須趁早解決底，我們對此願提供三點意見：</p>
<p>一，失業的原因第一在政府對於學校畢業生的出路漫無計劃。敎育原要適應目前環境需要，準備蓋什樣房屋就製造什樣磚瓦。我們應該考量目前國家究竟有那些事業要做，需要若干人才，然後按步就班地訓練做那些事業需要那麽多數量底人才。這樣地量出爲入，纔能達到「事有人做』和『人有事做』兩個大原則。目前我們只是數衍人事，濫設大學，大批製造一些不甚合用底學生們，把他們送出校門，就算繳了貨，缷了責任。這是無目的底敎育，無目的怎樣能有功效？</p>
<p>二，許多靑年失業，並非由於人才過剩，而是由於百業停頓。比如說醫，如果國家要把醫藥衛生設備做到近代化與合理化，目前可繳用底醫藥人才距實際需要底還相差甚遠。因為國家對醫藥衛生設備根本沒有下手舉辦，纔呌學醫底人們在醫生最缺乏底中國無事可做。這種矛盾現象在每門公衆事業都是如此，工程師荒而工程師無事可做，敎師荒而敎師無事可做。解決方法當然就是公衆事業的發展。由於戰事的綿延，發展公衆事業當然有許多困難，但非絕對不可能。學校可以維持，其它機關爲什麽就不能維持？道不全是經費問題，最重要底還是計劃組織與推動力。束手無策，事自然停頓，人自然閒散。</p>
<p>三，許多靑年失業，也有幾分由於公務員的任用與淘汰還沒有合理底辦法。政府機關如毛，機關冗員如毛，可做事底位置都被一些無能底人們佔住，所以少年英俊之士無從插足。合理底辦法是機關以內嚴行考績制度，應裁汰的裁汰；機關以外嚴行考試制度，可補缺底補缺。這樣辦不但可以根絕夤綠倖進，仗勢戶位之類弊端，不但可以解決一部份失業問題，還可以提高行政效能，獎勵一般公民的努力上進。</p>
<p>轉眼就是署假，又有一大批果業生要離開學校謀事了，失業的問題會一天嚴重似一天，我們希望政敎當局能明瞭這問題的嚴重性，趁早拿出一個辦法來。</p>

<h3>美軍事領袖提出計劃　擴充兵力增強國防　要求軍費增至二百四十億</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕紐約廿五日廣播：華盛頓訊，今日美國軍事領袖要求國會立即擴充武裝部隊，及徽集十儿歲至廿五歲各級靑年。國防部長福萊斯特謂，目前情形，尙對和平與世界自由國家有利，惟渠要求國會立即核准下列各節：（一）將現行核准之陸海空軍兵力增加三十四萬九千五百人；（二）另撥現款三十億美元以應此項擴軍工作之需要，按現行預算中國防費用爲一百十億美元；（三）徽發十九歲至廿五歲各級靑年，如此可得一百三十五萬五千人，但所需或僅二十二萬人；（四）成立普遍軍訓之永久制度，使其在三年內究成，如此每年可產生受有基本軍事訓練之人約八十五萬人。至於其他詳細情形，福氏認爲由於“前世界之局勢，必須在秘密會議中提出報吿。福萊斯特力曾增强國防以阻抑蘇聯之迫切性，在渠所主張增加之兵力中，計陸軍廿四萬人，海軍六萬三千人，陸戰隊一萬一千人，空軍三萬五千五百人。目下美國之實際兵力爲一百三十九萬二千人，而核准之最高兵力限額爲一百七十三萬二千人。在要求增加之軍費中，渠主張以七億七千五百萬美元用於空軍及飛機製造與研究方面，約七十六萬美元用於軍事人員方面，其他則用以應付零星用途。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕紐約廿五日廣播：華盛頓訊，財政部某高級官員今日稱，茍稅入不予削减，則爲在軍事上進行準備而增加二三百億美元之支出，不致對美國經濟發生重大影響。惟渠又謂，如支出須較此一數字猶大三四倍，則恢復管制實有必要，甚或其範圍較戰時之管制尤大，以防通貨膨脹，此外稅率亦須增加。換言之，除第二次世界大戰期間所實施之配給，眼價與其他管制外，復須强迫徵發工人從事必要之工作。渠謂政府爲防止蘇聯擴張而在軍事上進行準備之計劃，其範圍尙未研究中。</p>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓牙四日電〕美國空軍部今日宣布，將續招新兵二萬五千名。一星期前該部會宣布空軍員額已達卅一萬二千名，不擬續招。今日忽又變計，擬招滿卅三萬七千名，已婚士兵入伍禁令亦解除。據聞空軍部將要求國會批准擴充空軍官兵至四十五萬名或五十萬名，換言之，目前之五十五隊須擴充至七十隊。衆議院中今日提出一案，主張空軍設立七十個戰鬥隊伍，廿二個特別隊伍，並設立國防空軍廿七隊以下及空軍後備隊至少卅四隊。</p>
<p>〔聯合社舊金山廿五日電〕海軍軍械局長諾貝爾小將今日穴稱：自第二世界大戰結束以來，美國海軍器械常在革新，現已學世無敵。軍艦所備高射砲擊中敵機之準確性，較之戰爭結束時計增加百分之五十以上，一旦有事即可應命。</p>
<h3>美物資不絕運往蘇聯　國會人士頗憤慨　杜魯門發表談話加以解釋</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕紐約廿五日廣播：華盛頓訊，國會對美國運載供應品赴蘇一節，憤慨異常。今日杜魯門總統在記者招待會中謂蘇聯目前爲一友好國家，大部裝運之貨物，係兩年前所訂約者。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社華盛頓廿四日電〕國務部軍火局局長彼得遜令日聲稱，杜豈門總統將提前發表聲明，嚴厲限制將飛機機件及其他重要戰爭物資運往蘇聯及其衛星國。</p>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓廿五日電〕美國飛機引擎及其他物資於世界大局緊張聲中運往蘇聯事，今日正在國會方面引起極大之公慣，擬衆院調査委會主席列茲萊稱，現將採取下述三種行動：（一）要求商務部完全停止將美國物資運往蘇聯及其附庸各國。（二）立即調査紐約碼頭是否堆積運往蘇聯之貨箱。（三）澈底調査紐約摩爾麥克柯克輪船公司代蘇聯駐　購料處承運情形。</p>
<p>委員會調査員已到該輪船公司査勘賬册，並將調査一月一日以來懸掛蘇聯國旗輪船六十艘，在紐約港裝貨情形。</p>
<p>國務部國際資源司副司長安杜生昨在衆院調査委會陳述稱，國務部尙未擬定分別友邦與非友邦貨運政策，各委員聞言均大駭異。列茲萊並稱，剩餘物資淸理局長賴生曾向其報吿稱，昨接命令，飭將美國境內所有剩餘飛機，飛機配備及零件全部凍結，不准出口。惟該局其他職員則謂並不知有此項命令。列茲萊旋向記者解釋稱，或者陸海軍當局現欲保留剩餘飛機，以待世界局勢有何變化。「惟在吾人需要正殷之時，以軍用物資供給史達林爺叔，亦太可笑。」紐約州議員克爾納亦有同感，據稱，本國以生存有關之物資運往蘇聯，眞使人痛心疾首。</p>
<h3>普遍軍訓建議　羅斯福夫人贊成　愛因斯坦表反對</h3>
<p>〔美國新聞處華盛頓廿四日電〕羅斯福夫人與愛因斯坦，對於本日向參院兵役委會所提之普遍軍訓建議，各發表彼此不同之意見。當兵役委會繼續公開聽取關於普遍軍訓問題之意見時，將工人之函當衆宣讀而列入記錄。羅斯福夫人之函內，述及伊以前反對普遍軍訓之事，並稱，「但目下余不再反對普遍軍訓，因余以爲此一姿態，足使蘇聯明白吾人保持强大之目標，直至聯合國能成立一枝足以控制任何侵略之軍隊，而各國亦能逐步裁减軍備爲止。」愛因斯坦之函內宣稱，普遍軍訓將加速軍備之競爭，增加美蘇間神經之緊張，因而增加戰爭之危險「依余之見，惟有在可能預見之將來，如有敵性侵犯美國領土之威脅存在時，則强迫軍訓之運用，方爲必要與合理。余相信此種威脅，目下並不存在」</p>
<p>另一反對普遍軍訓之證人，爲全國擁護華萊士競選總統委員會新任命之退伍軍人指導委員林菲爾，渠曾宣讀一聲明。渠謂該項聲明係由其他許多人所準備者。諾貝爾獎金獲得者及有助於發明原子彈之核子物理學家康譽槙博士，力促通過普遍軍訓立法。</p>
<h3>美減稅法案</h3>
<p>兩院通過送總統簽署</p>
<p>〔路透社華盛頓廿四日電〕衆議院今日通過所得稅减稅法案，可使全國五千二百萬納稅人少付所得稅，使收入微薄之七百四十萬人免付所得我。該案今當呈交杜魯門總統簽准，預料總統將予否決，果爾將交兩院複議，如再以三分之二多數通過即成法律。</p>
<h3>巴拿馬嚴防間諜</h3>
<p>〔合衆社巴拿馬京城廿五日電〕巴拿馬外交部發言人頃稱，在中國之蘇聯人民多名要求頒發護照，俾在巴拿馬居住或過境，政府現正採取嚴峻步驟，以防蘇聯間諜或破壞者抵達巴拿馬運河。發言人稱，尙無發現破壞及間諜活動之報吿，然恐此批蘇僑一抵巴拿馬，「即樂不思蜀，或藉無恥經手人之助，購買永久地產。」</p>
<h3>義大利對特港問題願與南直接談判　惟須以三強建議為依據</h3>
<p>〔合衆社羅馬廿五日電〕錢大利外交部今日宣佈：義國已準備「在西方國家建議之精神文字內」，與南斯拉夫直接展開特里埃斯特港談判。發言人重申義政府之信念稱，特港問題解決前，義南問維持和平實屬不可能。外交部發表義南已獲致協議，因和約境界之更動，維尼齊亞求利亞區併入南國之養人，得與留在義境之斯拉夫人交換。「義政府對此協議，欣慰異常，今後數日將發表義南聯合公報，宣佈協議之細目。」</p>
<p>〔路透社倫敦廿四日電〕貝文外相今日在下院中聲明，英美法之決定建議將特港歸還義國，決非以養大利之普選爲動機。渠於答覆工黨議員特里培之質問時，指出早在對義和約簽字時，即已談及俟和約簽字後四個月後駐軍自特港區撤退後，當重新提出特港歸還義國之問題。復以設立自由區之協定不獲成立，未曾提出歸還問題。最近爲謀打破僵局起見，英美法始決定建議特港之歸還義國。最近數月來之事件，顯示設立特港自由區之規定已無法施行，英美法三國政府認爲無論基於政治或經濟的觀點，唯一的解決辦法，祗有將特港歸還義國。三國對於與蘇聯就此事獲致協議一點，並不悲觀，茍能成立協定，下一步驟將爲向聯合國提出報吿。</p>
<h3>特港共黨示威　南封鎖邊界</h3>
<p>〔路透透社特里埃斯特廿四日電〕共黨發起之反對特港歸還義國示威，今日在此舉行，參加者四千餘人。義人原擬在戈里齊正舉行以反對戈省割讓南國之示威則於臨時取消。</p>
<p>〔路透社倫敦廿四日電〕巴黎電告稱，南斯拉夫與特港自由區之邊界，已經當局封閉。</p>
<p>〔聯合社特里埃斯特廿四日電〕英軍發言人今日稱，英軍繼續調往特港靠近南斯拉夫邊界區域，以爲戒備。</p>
<h3>華萊士抨擊美對義政策</h3>
<p>〔路透社巴黎廿五日電〕美第三黨總統候選人華萊士，爲法國左傾獨立報紙「直言報」撰文，指美國在義大利可採之政策足以引起戰爭。他說，美國民主共和黨集團爲義大利選舉付出的代付，　打破世界任何一國競選所價的代價。美國此等政策，不啻奔下趨間戰爭的斜坡。杜魯門總統已發動歇期的里的戰爭熱，以便得以宣布全國緊急狀態。美國之秉政者以號召愛好和平的國民反抗蘇聯侵略為首。擬使中國成爲戴上　面見的警察國，以確保對世界的控制權。彼等於資本家利潤蒸蒸日上之際，企圖禁止工會提高待遇的要求，資本家的暴利固係政府給予軍事性津貼所造成云。</p>
<h3>美研究秘密計劃　鐵幕後鼓勵反共地下工作　從勃里奇言詞中首次獲得暗示</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕紐約廿五日廣播：華盛頓訊，據悉，國會方面刻正硏究撥付數千數百萬美元以進行一項秘密計劃，俾在鐵幕之後鼓勵非共產份子進行地下工作，傳已派定若干外交軍事官員負責此項工作。此項消息，自撥款委會主席勃里奇之言中第一次得到暗示，渠曾謂美國應鼓勵在鐵幕後進行地下活動，藉以動搖業已被共產主義征服地區之暴政。據謂該項計劃將由國務院辦理，並以必要之基金供給馬歇爾國務卿。</p>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓廿四日電〕參院撥款委員會主席勃里奇對美政府戰後對蘇政策突作閃電式之攻擊，渠指斥若干共和黨員之跟隨兩黨政策。勃里奇抨擊共和黨與民主黨之採取所謂「肥皂泡外交」，渠稱，戰後美國之外交政策均爲游移不定者，渠呼籲立即批准十七點軍事與經濟動員計劃，以應付蘇聯世界「陰謀」之威脅。此十七點計劃包括：（一）美國內共黨須立即登記；（二）防範不力之聯邦政府官員撤職；（三）加强美國國外基地，補足軍隊之缺額，增加陸海空軍軍力量。</p>
<h3>克萊登傳將出任　援歐案總管</h3>
<p>〔路透社華盛頓廿四日電〕前經濟事務副國務卿克萊登，傳將出任年俸二萬元之歐洲復興方案總管理，克氏係哈伐那國際貿易就業大會美代表團之團長，甫於去秋因健康不佳辭去副國務卿職，即以赴哈伐那與會，歐洲復興方案總管理，階級與內閣閣員等，所屬職員在華盛頓有五百人，在國外有四百人。</p>
<h3>美眾院續討論援外統一法案</h3>
<p>胡佛對全案表示贊成</p>
<p>〔中央社華盛頓廿五日電〕美前總統胡佛贊成衆院所擬訂之包括對華經濟軍事援助之對外援助法案，胡氏於答覆衆議長馬丁要求提出建議之函件中稱：對希土及中國之援助，係衆院法案中最爲有益之規定條款。</p>
<h3>新聞自由會議大會中　美嚴詞抨擊蘇聯　大會分組研究確保新聞自由</h3>
<p>〔路透社日內瓦二十五日電〕美國代表前助理國務卿班登，今“在國際新聞自由會議全體大會中，嚴辭抨繫蘇聯，他說戰版行爲及虛僞變導最惡劣的同謀，乃爲由私人或政府獨佔新聞事業，新聞事業之獨佔愈嚴不實的報導亦愈多。去年九月在聯合國大會席上對於美國報界的指責，對象顯然錯誤，控訴的手指，應該指向東方面不應指向美國的自由報業。不過四星期前在距離日內瓦僅五百哩的捷克，自由已宣吿死亡，在不遠的其他國家，我們亦看見自由紛紛死亡，此等事件，已使全球珍惜人類尊嚴，思想自由及國家獨立之人，感覺驚怖。</p>
<p>班登繼日：此次會議，或不能就議程全部成立協議，但若能確立若干原則，明示新聞自由對和平的關係則吾人之工作，亦已並不虛繼矣。</p>
<p>〔合眾社日內瓦二十五日電〕班登宣佈美國在該會之計劃爲：（一）覓取國際協定，規定不受武斷之國家限制之採訪傳遞新聞辦法：（二）贊助一切提倡各國人民及新聞社有收取，出版，廣播及以他法傳播新聞權利之一切提議；（三）審査各種適宜方式以發農各國之技術投備，報紙，無綫電等，而擴大人民之新聞來源；（四）希望建議中之聯合國人權宣言及章程，能嚴格支持言論出版自由。</p>
<p>〔路透社日內瓦廿四日電〕南斯拉夫出席國際新聞自由大會之代表團，於今日發表聲明，要求控制情報機構之任何人，應負渠所發佈之任何誹謗性謊言及煽動戰爭謠言的法律上之責任。南代表團指出許多國家內之報紙及情報工具，已成少數巨頭之獨佔事業，爲其所代表之個人利益而說話。美國資本家，憑其物質能力，已防止美國之得有自由報紙。頃悉，英國代表團將向五十六國提出保證新聞自由的肯定建議，大會各代表已組成四價委員會以研究確保新聞自由之各種問題，自由觀念不同之各派，預料將在委員會中發生衝突。聯合國敎育科學文化組織會長赫斯萊敎授，向大會發表演說，籲請各代表放棄主義及理論，處理實際問題。渠提出四大要點：（一）防止新聞傳遞工具之爲少數人獨佔；（二）新聞傳遞工具之平等享受；（三）傳遞工具之技術方法的分享；（四）使用近代傳遞工具者之責任心。</p>
<h3>英議員聯名建議　三巨頭會談　謀挽回國際危局</h3>
<p>〔路透社倫敦廿四日電〕工黨議員柯克斯，工黨左翼議員領袖克洛斯曼等十六人，業於今日向下議院提出動議案，要求由史達林，杜魯門及艾德禮以及英共和邦領若南非總理史末資，印度總督蒙巴頓等舉行會談，俾與蘇聯覓取諒解。其動議案對國際局勢之迅速惡化，表示悲痛，對史末資總理週五發表之談話，主張與蘇覓取諒解等語表示支持。</p>
<h3>委首席代表病逝</h3>
<p>〔中央社日內瓦廿五日合衆電〕國際新聞自由會議頃宣稱。委內瑞拉出席該會議之首席代表方波納，昨晚因心臟病逝世，全體乃起立靜默一分鐘誌哀。</p>

<h3>美將在安理會中建議　開聖地休戰會議　杜魯門總統對記者宣布</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕紐約廿五日廣播：華盛頓訊，杜魯門總統今日在記者招待會上宣稱，美國將建議由聯合國召集阿拉伯及猶太領袖舉行休戰會議，以停止巴勒斯坦之戰事。渠謂美國駐聯合國代表奧斯汀江即將向安理會提出。杜魯門表示仍贊成分治計劃，惟爲應付英軍退出後之局勢計，主張暫時由聯合國託管。</p>
<p>〔路透社倫敦廿四日電〕英殖民大臣瓊斯吿本社記者，聲明英國決於五月十五日交出巴勒斯坦之委治，至遲於八月一日完全撤退駐巴勒斯坦之英軍，不論聯合國之討論結果如何，英國決不變更此一決議。</p>
<p>〔路透社成功湖廿四日電〕法國與加拿大今日在安全理事會中聲明，在目前階段兩國尙不能支持美國主張在巴勒斯坦設托管制之議。法代表巴洛第並請安理會謹愼從事先開秘密會議，聆取美國代表更詳細的意見，然後再決定應否召開聯合國特別全體大會，以檢討聯大原來之分治決議。</p>

<p>〔法國新聞社華盛頓廿四日電〕杜魯總統今日述及哈伐那國際貿易大會之結果謂，國際商業組織法規之簽字，實爲接近建設，世界繁榮與持久和平之重要成續。又稱，此一計劃足以證明許多國家對於國際複練問題，均可賴聯合國商得同意。</p>
<h3>柏林四強聯合司令部　會議仍照常舉行　蒙帥將赴德視察英佔區</h3>
<p>〔路透社柏林廿四日電〕柏林區英美法蘇四强副司令，今日在柏林之聯合司令部（即柏林區盟國軍政府）中，已就若干問題成立「最好的諒解」。法軍發言人事後謂四强已就若干問題獲致協議。此乃索柯洛夫斯基元帥步出盟管會會議以來諸强間之初次協議象徵。據悉，當聯合司令部會議午餐時休會，英美法蘇四司令各以蘇方供給之伏特加酒互相祝賀。據英軍發言人稱，會議進展殊爲正常，空氣且較平時猶略見友好。同時據向蘇當局登記之報紙透露，西德與東德邊界之管制，預料印將加緊執行。</p>

<h3>義普選展望</h3>
<p>〔路透社羅馬廿五日電〕此間政治觀察家組信，四月十八日之普選中，投票者如極踴躍，則加斯貝利及其他溫和政黨可望獲得勝利。然義國四千六百萬人口中之中產階級一千萬人，態度如何尙難預測，一般而論，加斯貝利之重稅政策及緊縮通貨政策對中產階級打擊頗重，除此以外，一般中產階級多反對敎會政治，對於加斯貝利的基督民生黨獨攬大權深致不瞞。然另一方面，中產階級鑒於捷克事件對共黨咸具戒心，而對於美國給義之援助亦多有良好印象。在此等情形下，中產階級之支持溫和黨派可望較多。就左翼方面言，在最近共黨領袖及其友黨之會議中，佔計共黨領導之人民陣綫，可獲選票約一千一百萬。義全國登記之選民約二千七百萬，如共黨方面之估計相當準確，則中間及右翼黨派尙須加倍努力，以取得超過共黨之多數優勢。</p>

<p>屈氏隨後指出，今後援助之某種計劃，租給或借款方式可能即將由美國會考慮之。屈氏强調稱：美國援助不能無限期繼續下去。「援助僅能暫時彌補短少，直至日本能够自助，日本必須儘力做到之」同時，全國化學業銀行行長約翰司敦及陸長之特別顧問費司亦參加此會議。此次會議並特別地檢討有關糧食。煤及鋼生產之情形，蓋此項情形乃自給自足及經濟轉機之主要基礎。彼等並討論振興日本國外貿易之必要，此乃使日本獲得原料及供給遠東國家听急需之商品之方法。屈氏並强調日本平衡其預算表之軍要性，渠稱：此乃維持物價及幣制穩定之重要條件。蘆田允許在，「儘早時期內」以最大努力平衡預算表。</p>

<h3>柯孚海峽案觀審記</h3>
<p>— （本報駐歐特派員記者中西）</p>
<p>第一庭的開場白</p>
<p>院長勾萊樓於機聲稍斂時，起立致詞略稱，國際法院現有兩案待審，一即爲本日起開審之柯孚海峽案，另一爲加入聯合國爲會員之國家應具何項資格及條件案。後一案將於本年四月十五日開庭，聽取各方意見，然後由法院決定向聯合國提供諮詢意見。</p>
<p>旋請智利法官亞爾伐雷與阿爾巴尼亞臨時法官亞克斯納起立補行宣誓典禮，高舉有手，其誓詞爲「余謹鄭重聲明，決誠實忠信，大公無私，一本良心，執行法官職權」誓畢，由原吿英方律師蕭克勞致詞。按蕭氏爲現任英國檢察官長，其職權有如我國司法部長，以善言詞稱，體魄魁梧，精神飽滿。蕭氏以法院初次開庭，先表示賀忱，繼謂「英國遠在十八年前，早已接受當時國際常設法庭之强制管轄權，英國極端反對戰爭，認爲係盲衝動之力量與不可遏制之本能的產物，而非人類之意思與理智所能克服者。英國人民深信人類之意志，必須壓倒擾亂與破壞之勢力，是以根據法律與正義，以司法解決爭議，實爲國際社會中最要而最不可缺少之條件。故國際法院對於維持和平工作，今年實負有日益重大之責任」。</p>
<p>旋由阿爾巴尼孤代表伊利致詞，除向法院致賀外，强調「平等公正與主權」乃新法院今後執行職務時所應尊視之三大原則。國際間之爭執問題，因需詳愼調査硏究，衡以正義，始得持平解決。國際法院固在發揚國際正義，但亦不能忽視現實及國際法之適用，各國之間並應互相尊視，蓋和平不能徒恃强國之法律。故聯合國憲章明定，愛好和平之國家均享有平等之主權，深望法院對於此點不應忽視。</p>
<p>阿爾巴尼亞方面，於其代表伊利向法院致賀詞後，即由所聘捷克律師傳筱克教授代爲辯護，傳氏引經據典，涉及國際公法諸家權威學說，聯合國憲章與法院院章等條文，作學術論文式之辯解，以法語演說，由舌人譯爲英語。其演詞頗長，自二月廿日下午五時起至廿八日上午十一時始畢全稿，前後共經四庭，耗時計九小時。自廿八日上午十一時起，由英方律師蕭克勞與其代表英外部法律顧問白蓋德先後起立辯護，亦多方引證過去判例，反覆强調憲章精神，以詞長並須譯爲法文，亦經七八庭始告終結。至三月五日下午由院長宣吿暫行閉庭，聽候裁處。</p>
<p>原被告論據概要</p>
<p>阿爾巴尼亞政府方面認爲依照聯合國安理會建議，應由當事國共同將爭議案交由國際法院審處，但英國事前未徵阿方政府同意，單方逕向國際法院由請起訴，實有違聯合國憲章第卅六條及國際法院院章第卅六條之規定。同時安理會之所爲者係「建議」，並非一決議」，故阿政府並不受其拘束。總之，英國政府於安理會建議後，未與阿政府商議協定，逕自提出訴訟，實與規定不符。國際法院對於本案一方應不予受理，同時對阿政府自亦無權强制管轄。</p>
<p>英國政府方面認爲阿爾巴尼亞政府擬僅因手續上問題而有損阿爾巴尼亞顏面，不願提交國際法院審判，英政府可於此時此地立即建議與阿政府訂立一共同將柯孚海峽案交付國際法院裁決之協議。况在阿爾巴尼亞政府未有拒絕交審前，英政府從未提及强制管轄權問題，惟阿方果不接受此一建議，英政府對於此案之態度，以爲安理會之建議，不僅在道德上，即在法律上亦有其拘東力。阿爾巴尼亞前曾一度請求加入聯合國，其願履行會員國之義務，當不待言，因此自應遵守聯合國憲章第廿五條之規定，履行安理會之建議。復次，依據一九三六年三月十一日國際常設法庭庭章之規定，非會員國亦可無需與爭議國訂有協定，將爭議交由法院裁決。設英方解釋錯誤，可即請法院明逝。總之，吾人不能因技術問題而閃避法院之管轄。又依聯合國憲章第九十二條之規定，國際法院乃聯合國主要之司法機構，英政府係根據安理會建議而申請，國際法院自有權管轄</p>
<p>柯孚海峽案炸傷英艦之水雷，是否爲阿爾巴尼亞政府所佈，仍無定論。惟據聞阿爾巴尼亞之所以表示接受安理會建議，蓋當時阿爾巴尼亞政府認爲如此，即可於聯合國第二次大會時被通過爲聯合國之會員，不意以後事與願遝，因此乃以英國手續上錯誤爲理論，抗告法院應不予以受理，進而打銷此案。</p>
<p>一般預測，此次開庭結果，如阿政府理由爲多數法官所同意，則英政府對阿之控訴，國際法院將不再予以審理，反之，多數法官如認爲英方手續並無不當，則柯孚海峽案本題，國際法院將令雙方提交該院審處，縱阿方拒避，法院亦將作缺席之審判，加以裁決。（完）</p>

<h3>方主委指示　三剿三不對付共匪</h3>
<p>方主委謂各省流亡來滬難胞，應特別提高警覺，勿受共匪地下工作人員利用。共匪計劃在滬發動五罷一難，所謂「一難」，即利用難民，搗亂破壞，故難胞應加强團結，檢査內部，勿使共呃潛入活動。共匪妄圖五罷一難，擾亂治安，我們即當以「三剿」「三不」對付共匪，「三剿」即剿土共，剿洋共，剿假共。「三不」—即不替共匪工作，不替共呃作工具，不替共匪帶路。必須如此，共匪方能肅淸，我們一面希望政府加緊救濟難胞工作，更希望難胞安分守己，服從政府法令，不爲共匪利用。詞畢，復請中委葉溯中氏致詞，繼由蘇北·安徽·山東等各省難民代表凌嘯天·孫鐵吾·王華民·楊桐林等相繼報吿各匪區暴行，語多沉痛，聲淚俱下。其中尤以凌嘯天親述其兄弟爲呃殺害，匪破鹽城時，父母妻女均爲匪衝散，至今生死不明，隻身逃出，說來熟淚縱横。其餘各代表亦均慷慨陳詞，誓與共匪鬥爭到底，幷堅求政府組織武裝還鄕隊，打回老家去。最後幷由顧竹軒加以結論，情况空前熱烈，至下午六時始散。</p>
<h3>發表告各界書　揭露共匪陰謀</h3>
<p>遭受匪災各省旅滬同鄕會發表「敬吿各界人士書」稱，親愛的同胞們：自從共匪出賣國家，破壞統一，稱兵作亂，到處發動淸算鬥爭，殘殺無辜以來，我們善良的各省難胞，或因出於正義，　京光明，或因被迫離鄉，逃亡京生，而絡續來滬的，已不下數十萬人，我們眼見着親友眷朋爲匪百般殘刑屠戳，父兄子弟爲匪强迫參軍，驅逼前錢充當肉彈，更痛心着家鄕淪陷，爲匪破壞騷擾，不得不流浪來此，甚至無衣無食，容身無處求生無術的不知有多多少少。雖然蒙本市賢明當局及各界熱心人士設所庇寒，施食救濟，大部難胞得以差度寒冬，但我們深深體味到今日的慘况，與造成我們痛苦的淵源，於熱淚横流之餘，敬揭數點爲我各界人士吿：（一）共匪在匪區所作所爲的，眞可以說完全違反人性，違反理性，絕滅鋼常，絕滅倫理的獸行，而其暴民專制，製造鬥爭，意無所不用其極，人民生命，隨時可以爲其借用「國特」「反動」「思想不穩」「資產者」等種種名義而遭受屠殺，人民的言論出版等自由，那更談不到了。所以當今天我們看到了那些爲共匪宣傳所欺朦的人，猶在大談高唱匪區的民主自由的時候，我們眞不知如何的啼笑皆非，在這裏我們要大聲疾呼的正吿各界人士，共匪的宣傳，都是手段，部是偽裝，在共匪未竄抵前，我們也未嘗沒有做過這種還夢，但事實所吿訴我們的恰恰相反，因此我們後方的同胞們，爲了要保全你們的生家財產，避免我們今天的遭遇，必須出錢出力，要動員起來，剿滅共匪（二）誰無父母，誰無兄弟，今大我們拋棄了親友，離背了家鄉，琉浪到此決不是爲了個人的茍安，更不是爲了偸生，我們所唯一冀求的是在一方面除將我們身歷的痛苦，向各方同胞申訴，再不要受其欺愚，此外主要的在呼籥政府從速加派大軍，加强戡亂，收回爲匪正在蹂躪的家鄕，拯救千千萬萬在水深火熟中的無吿難胞，早日重睹光明，更使我們這批無家可歸的流浪者，得能重返家鄕，我們一定能爲政府作先驅，配合國軍全力進剿，而後方的各界人士，更希望給予我們最有力的援助。（三）在這時局危難的情况下，共匪爲了企圖造謠生事挑撥離間，擾亂社會秩序和破壞地方治安起見，不惜用種種卑鄙手段來利用我們難胞。關於這一間題，我們除了感謝各方的關心外，我們特別要指出的而且要請大家放心的，就是今日我們這一般難胞的遭遇，可以說完全由共匪造成的，共匪的種稱陰謀與手段。在別的人也許可為其欺騙，在我們已是身受其苦，任何的小惠與勾餌，引誘不了我們，欺騙不了我們。我們除加緊的自動防範檢舉，並嚴守政府法令，不作軌外行動外，決不使共匪得陰謀的逞於毫厘。親愛的同胞們，共匪的野心，決不在一區一地，它的目的，簡直要在蹂躪侵擾我全國，以達到他們出賣祖國，滅亡祖國的狠毒陰謀，因此我們不論前方後方，不論已被共匪侵佔或未被共匪竄擾，我們的命運實在是同一的。我們除感謝各界人士予我們熱烈的援助與溫暖情緒外，我們今後必須更要加强團結，在賢明的領袖領導下，加强完成戡亂建國的革命任務。最後，我們要高呼：一，擁護政府加强戡亂。二，難胞們組織起來，打回老家去。三，不受共呃煽惑，不受共匪勾餌。四，絕對遵守政府法令，不作軌外行動。五，大家起來剿滅共匪。六，三民主義萬歲。七，蔣主席萬歲。八，中華民國萬歲。上將主席電議會上蔣主席電，原文如下：南京國民政府主席蔣，行政院長張，國防部長白，參謀總長陳，各行轅主任，各剿匪總部總司令，各綏靖公署主任鈞鑒，全國戡亂將士均鑒：溯自禹甸銷兵，島夷解甲，神州再造，遐邇臚歡，詎萬惡共匪，竟於復員邁進之際，斯民刧火之餘，掀內亂之大波，爲建國之故障，生靈塗炭，國本動搖，喪心病狂，莫此爲甚。至今勝利兩載，匪氛益熾，瞻望前途，怒　如　。本會集議滬瀆，一致擁護戡亂國策，軍民協力，敉平匪患，加强自衛武力，保國衛鄕，聽候馳驅，伏乞俯順輿情，大張撻伐，迅予戡亂，收復匪區，排除統一復興之障礙，達成戡亂救國之偉業，國家民族，實深利賴。迫切陳詞，諸維埀啓，遭受匪災各省旅滬同鄉會聯席會議叩。</p>

<h3>總工會告工友書　加強警覺自肅自勵</h3>
<p>總工會爲本市治安當局搜捕共匪份子，昨特發吿工友書，全文云：「親愛的工友們：本會接得各業工會的報吿，軍警當局於最近幾天逮捕工人多名，要求本會營救。本會當即向主管當査詢逮捕理由，經本市治安當局說明，係根據自首共匪份子口供的綫索，逮捕潛伏本市的共匪份子，並搜確切證據，決沒有濫捕的情形，並於今日下午，約請本會，及其他團體機關，赴市政府公開參觀這次搜獲之證據。本會參閱之下，認爲政府這一緊急措置，是有事實的證據，所以我們總工會特把我們的態度和立塲正吿我全體工友：</p>
<p>一，自陰曆年關以來，共匪陰謀，層出不窮，在搜到的證據中，證實共呃陰謀大規模破壤公用事業和生產事業，煽動罷工。最近因國民大會即將召開，共匪更準備在江南各地，騷動擾亂，製造恐怖空氣，以阻撓國家憲政的實施。政府爲保護社會安寗，推行戡亂決策，這種措置，本會當與全國同胞同一心情，至誠擁護。</p>
<p>二，這次搜捕奸匪份子，行動之前，政府有確實的證據，縝密的佈置，事後又公開招待各界報吿經過，參觀證據，足見政府有保障人權的決心，而無濫捕的情事，所以我們決不再聽信任何歪曲挑撥和煽動。</p>
<p>三，國家不保護叛國的國民，社會不容忍背叛的份子，我們總工會是工人的團體，我們的責任在保護良善的工友，維擭生產事業。共匪份子出賣國家民族利益，不容於國，不容於社會，我們當然更不能允許他們利用我們善良的工人，所以我們全體工人更應加强警覺，自肅自勵，把一切背叛國家民族的共匪份子，逐出工人群眾。</p>
<p>最後我們提出我們口號：（一）擁護政府戡亂建國。（二）保障善良工人安心工作。（三）工會保陣好工人，不保障共匪。（四）把共匪份子越出去。（五）驅逐破壞生產的共匪份子。</p>

<h3>西南大動脈湘桂黔鐵路　都筑段工程踏勘記（上）</h3>
<p>〔本報貴陽二十日航訊〕湘桂黔鐵路是我國西南的大動脈，關係綦重，三十四年春，中央爲準備對日反攻並完成鐵路五年計劃，原段之湘桂，黔柏兩路工程局合併組織湘桂黔鐵路工程時，負責復軌及繼續未究工程關於都匀至貴陽段之興建工程，則由該局於三十五年夏組織都筑段工程處負責辦理。交通部並特派在鐵道工程界素以學驗俱豐見稱之劉建熙氏總管其事，設處以來，積極慶開興建工作，迄今瞬逾一年又半，在國庫支細，運輸困難，材料缺乏。物價奇漲諸種困難條件之下，幸賴全段員司工役一致埋頭努力刻已完成全段工百分二十五，洵屬難能可貴之事。</p>
<p>都筑段鐵路，起自都匀縣之淸泰坡，經都匀縣之馬坡永興莊，文德聲，邊子店，麻江縣之榮埠司，谷濛，谷洞，樂坪，五洞橋，平越縣之沙坪，貴定縣之谷關，觀音閣，頭道橋，太老沖，桃花寨，同堡，木老寨，張家山；龍星縣之三元場，龍頭營，芝蔴鋪，五星橋龍時城廂，水橋，中壩，梅家莊，貴筑縣之王壩山，革老塲，二戈寨；至貴陽市之南郊止，全程計一百五十公里，沿綫穿苗越嶺山脈之霧雪山，及流入泗境之沅江上游與流入川境之島江上游，因形地形環境限制，非僅山高谷深，人口密度較稀，興建工程諸感不便，且全段工程最艱鉅部份，大都在美烟生產特別發達，農村經濟情形繁榮之貴定，平越麻江，都匀等縣境內，工程員司深受物價奇漲生活困難之苦。</p>
<p>記記者最近前往全段施工地點</p>
<p>由工程處工務組租長汪道源工程司曁各地總分段長主任員司導引參觀，鉅細彌遺，獲益良多。參觀歷程，爲時四日，計大小隧道二三五〇公尺，大橋六八〇公尺，小橋八〇〇公尺，運料便道四〇公里，土石方工程一五〇萬立公方，食宿車站票房兩座，電訊設備一七〇公里，往返歷程三三八公里。我們每到一地，各工程員司，無不以最興奮之熟情，及最懇摯之態度，與記者等講述最艱鉅之工作及最理想之希望。所謂最理想之希望者，就是希望政府早日撥足大興工的款項，即速籌運大興工的材料，以便他們負責在一年半最多兩年之內，把這條西南大動脈尙未完工的百分之七十五部份迅速完工，早日通車，他們又好到旁的需要他們去爲祖國興建鐵路的地方去努力効命。茲將記者參觀所得，逐一分述如後，以饗關心西南交通的諸位讀者。</p>
<p>我們一行六人，於本月十一日上午九時乘吉普離筑，沿都筑段公路綫出發，都筑段工程處劉處長建熙，特派主管工程的汪道源組長，陪引我們參觀沿綫施工情形，吉普向南急馳，其快如飛，汪組長抓着時機，在車上和我講述本段施工概況</p>
<p>讓我們先有一個輪廓的瞭解。十時許，抵達龍里縣城三公里之播水河，參觀該地橋工興建情形。橋工所主任工程司曁分段長等，均先時抵達，携有工度縮圖，示意圖，工程進程表，及文字說明等件，熱烈歡迎，該橋架於播水河上，與公路橋相距約五百公尺，全長八十二公尺，分爲五墩三孔，每孔徑空二十一米，就橋工而言，刻已完工百分之五十，橋樑鋼架均已運抵貴陽。現有工人百餘名，晝夜分班工作，尙無間斷情形，惟橋面所需之混凝土，附近砂石不够標準，需遠赴二十八公里以外之山地搬運殊爲艱苦。</p>
<p>播水橋參觀畢後，繼續南行，十二時許抵達距貴定一公里半地方，轉入都筑段工程處自築之運料便道約三公里而至第二總段所在地，該地爲交通部黔中機器廠舊址經修葺後頗爲整潔適用，幷有部立扶輪小學一所。總段長張　融，本省興義人，南京中央大學畢業，曾在粤漢湘桂，黔桂等鐵路供職二十餘年，對都筑段勘綫工作，盡力量大。據張總長向記者報吿該總段施工情形，謂第二總段起自麻江縣屬之岔河，至貴定縣屬之張家山，全長約三十公里，共計大小隧道二十三個，總長三六〇八公尺，隧道工程最感困難的爲美製黄炸璇缺乏，梯恩梯毒素太重，且年來不易購得，許多隧道工程，雖已將砲眼打好，卒以炸藥缺乏無法繼續施行。此外，尙需與建大橋</p>
<p>十餘個，小橋二十餘個，因地質複雜，施工最感困難，其中如貴定麻江界分之大栗樹橋，全長二九零公尺，分爲九孔十二墩，橋高三十公尺，徑空二十公尺，係鋼筋混凝土大拱橋，爲長江以南所罕見。</p>
<p>全總段土方工程，早已由各縣附近民工協助築構完成。所餘零碎石工，將來舖軌之前，再爲積一極從事，無碍舖軌時間。</p>
<p>截至目前爲止，總計全路總段工程，已完成百分之二十，其所感最大困難有三，一爲部款接濟不靈。二爲亟需材料缺乏，三爲員工待遇太薄，貴定隣近各縣，近年大量生產美菸，地方經濟畸形繁榮，以致物價高漲，特別驚人，較之貴陽省會地方，懸硃甚大，但該總段員司所獲待遇，反照貴州區一般生活指數支給，故下級員司及對工程不够熱心份子，流動極大，前途殊爲隱憂。總段方面組織有日用品消費合作社，利用工餘時間辦理農塲，種殖菜蔬，借用荒地，生產美菸，去年計收獲美菸三千餘萬元，全總段二百餘人，每人可分得十五六萬元，但杯水車薪，無補賓際。本年二月份員司火食每入六十餘萬，據估計本月份將近百萬不遠，此種情况，對於工程進展，不無影響，甚願能有具體解決辦法</p>
<p>記者等一行，在二總段稍憩，即赴聞江寺隧道參觀。隧道在楊保山下，距貴定縣城十公里，於三十五年六月十二日開工，爲都筑段所有隧道工程</p>
<p>開工之最早者。導坑全長四一五公尺，已於兩月前全部　通，現正在施行擴大與落底工程，因地質惡劣，砂石混雜，常有崩塌現象，俟將來木拱與石拱完成之後，即可保無虞。</p>
<p>聞江寺參觀畢後返二總段午餐，下午二時，經由貴定縣城南行，四時許抵達平域縣屬之谷濛關大隧道，隧工所主任陸永瑛工程司等車前迎接，情緒執熱烈，該地位居雲霧山脈之分水嶺，拔海一六〇〇公尺，地質極爲複雜，施工最感艱鉅，不僅在都筑段爲首屈一指，即就全國鐵路隧道工程而言，工程之大，亦居第四。我們在臨近大隧道東端興建落成之沙坪車站休息片刻，即集隊進入隧道參觀。導坑全長九六〇公尺，分爲東西兩段施工，東段長四八〇公尺，由工程司沈鈞負責，於三十六年五月一日開工。西段長四八〇公尺，由工程司章總負責，於同年三月十日開工。東段因土質不佳，屢挖屢塌，耗工費時，以致延緩導坑工作。西段進行因石質較佳，比較順利。兩段工程進行最高紀錄，曾達每日四公尺。（孟綺）</p>

<h3>山東綏區的民生</h3>
<p>〔本報濟南廿二日航訊〕山東迄今尚在生死鬥爭的階段中，局面是流動而不安定，一切隨軍事而轉移。全省之中，政府能確實控制的縣份僅有十七個，而淪陷的却有四十七縣。其餘半控制的縣份共二十二個，控制據點的縣份有十個，此進彼出，時常易手的縣份亦有十一個之多。這些數目字可以帮助我們了解今日魯局之艱苦和民生之憔悴。</p>
<p>全省農民的生活，已在生存綫的邊緣。農民辛苦耕作的收益，不足以供賦稅的支出，目前已在半飢餓狀態中。據省府某負責人說：今年二月份時，全省已有百分之四十以上的人吃不飽，將來接近收成時，至少有百分之八十的人沒有糧食果腹。在這種糧荒局面下，發生了壯丁逃荒的現象。例如嶧縣一地，即有三分之一的人口逃荒。他們離開故鄕的時候，一肩行李，兩袖淸風，大門用泥土一封，拍脚就走，毫無顧慮。因爲他們家裏什麼都已賣完，返鄉又不知在何年，所以一些留戀也沒有了。但是在山東省政府控制區之內，荒地僅佔全部面積的百分之二十，而糧荒竟如此之嚴重，推原其故，還是由於缺乏種子農具和勞働力，更主要的是農民的軍事負担太重。</p>
<p>軍事負担中，除了一般的賦稅之外，最値得硏究的還是過境部隊的供應。例如山東的滋陽縣（兌州）是去年五月由國軍收復的，現在是第十綏靖區司令部所在地，當地設有軍民合作總站，專事採購物資，供過境部隊的需要。自去年五月至今年二月份，共計供給柴九百四十萬斤以上，草二百三十萬斤以上，料一百三十萬斤以上，秫楷廿一萬斤以上。以上是物力的供應。至於勞力的征應，合作站曾爲過境部隊代倔牛車九千五百次以上，代僱民伕在三萬四千以上，代僱木工九百五十次，泥工一千次以上。其餘尙有散兵游勇，向民間直接勒索糧秣·燒柴·民伕·車輛等數字，均不在內。滋陽是人口僅有二十萬的縣份，並且戰爭的創傷還沒有復元，現在的巨量供應，使農村羅掘供空，不論當地的縣政府和過境部隊都承認了這個事實。滋陽一地如此，其他綏靖區內的縣份，情形亦是大同小異。</p>
<p>這是一個十分嚴重的問題，其直接的影響　造成糧荒和壯丁逃亡。而且據第十綏靖區司令官李玉堂將軍說：匪方鑒於魯省普遍糧荒反而在控制區內提出「不參軍」和「保護難民」的口號，以吸引逃荒的人口，竟相當收效。山東當地的行政幹部，從本身所遭受的困難中，亦認識了危機的所在。因爲現狀如任其拖下去，農村破產與人民心理的轉變，必然使匪軍能有機會吸收大最脫難生產的份子，力量日日增長，而使戡亂軍事難奏全功。因此，國軍應該立即在各鄉村設立正式的補給機構</p>
<p>將這項軍事供應改爲全國之負担，而非爲綏靖區農民獨有的負祖，並且在公平的立塲上，應由後方大都市的富戶負担。　山東當局對於地方武力的重要性，認識得最早，在一年半之前，就開始加以組訓，使其輔助國軍作戰。魯省各縣民間藏鎗，本來就多，平均每縣至少有一千枝，多者如滕縣，約在萬枝以上。在最近的淄川。桓台·泰安·東阿各役之中，地方團隊的忠勇，完全證明了省府當局的遠見。不渦從另一方面說，這些武力的存在，不免加重了農民的負祖，尤以地小人稀，辦理不善時，這種情形更是明顯。當地綏靖會議對這些問題亦考慮到，嘗議定統籌自衛經費辦法，由地方民意機構關公正士紳會同地方政府組織統籌委員會，在「人槍確實」「負担平均」「管理公開」三原則之下，實行統籌。照這個辦法切實施行，負担自可較爲合理。不過，以山東農村目前之貧困，最理想的辦法是實行兵農合一，將武力與生產打成一片，易言之，地方武力不能使農民脫離生產。從匪軍目前的策略來看，亦唯有這個辦法能從根本上打擊它。</p>
<p>難民在山東，今日亦是需要中央協助解決的問題。過去烟台等地的急賑工作僅是臨時性的救急，根本問題尙未解決。目前尙有難民三十萬，集中臨沂，由於人數太多，省府無法應付。魯西荷澤·曹縣等地，亦有難民二十萬人，集中於考城一帶，嗷嗷待哺。過去的事實證明：消極性的救濟是無補於事，不久之前，滋陽的貧民救濟，每個受惠之人，須自鄕間走十餘里進　，來領受五千元的賑款！至於有效的積極救濟，當然是以工代賑，但不是地方財力所能大規模舉辦的。</p>
<p>山東一般公敎人員的生活，可說是相當節儉刻苦。全省除靑島之外，公敎人員待遇是劃在第三級的範圍內。和靑島相比較，如果靑島一個公務員能拿一百四十萬的話，濟南只能拿八十五萬，省垣的公務員有些憤憤不平，因爲濟南物價並不低於靑島。他們希望中央下次調整待遇時，能將濟南與靑島列爲一級。自王耀武主魯後，省級公務員按月平價配給麵粉兩袋，時價是每袋一百七十萬，而配價僅有廿二萬。每年另發棉衣兩套，單衣兩套，薦任官布一匹，委任半匹。縣級人員比照省級配發。這種福利制度對公敎人員頗有實惠，不過據財廳負資人表示：麵粉配給的支出頗爲浩大，以後是否能長期維持，頗有問題。記者團在濟南，對一般民間疾苦的情形嘗多方探詢。當時省府主任秘書劉茂華和財政應長尹文敬答覆說：除建立地方武力的經費外，不准有其他任何攤派，不過國防工事費及渦境部隊的草料費，中央撥款甚少，依此支付，自不免變相的加重民間負祖。例如：濟南的環城壕工程浩大，人民負担的經費佔大部份，已呈請中央補償，但迄未批覆。由於中央撥款數字與現實的物價距離過甚，省方近一個月來有綏靖特捐的征收，以棉花。花生米等土產爲對象，力求不與中央稅源相牴觸，最近中央明令免收特捐，一切由中央負祖，希望中央能早日核定數目，使省方能預作準備。至於省財政自是困難萬分，今年上半年的預算是一千四百億，其中百分之八十是職員薪給，剩下來的事業費是寥寥無幾，少得可憐。記者團在山東所得的印象是從省級到縣級負責人員，大多對現狀認識淸楚，不作盲目的樂觀，而經騐能力，亦足以應付這個動盪的局面。（本報記者丁維棟）</p>

<h3>綠化瀋陽</h3>
<p>〔本報瀋陽廿一日航訊〕東北的早春，寒意尙在，瀋陽入春的陽光開始敎育人，各小學的學生在露天操塲上，坐自備的小板凳或廢墟上拾來的磚塊，上春天的一踝，把敎室讓給流血的傷兵同志住。</p>
<p>接收瀋陽的首任市長</p>
<p>董文崎，三月一日再度回到市政府大樓裏，他第一件工作就是清査戶口，展開防奸妨諜工作，這是瀋陽的精神消毒運動，剿滅一切謠言細菌。戶口淸査統計，瀋陽人口百萬掛零，較一年以前已减少了五分之一。這百萬人口的大都市中，飢民竟達三十一萬之多，其中三分之二靠豆餅生活，三分之一流浪街頭乞討，恐怕沒有一個都市，像瀋陽這樣需要憐憫和同情。</p>
<p>從東北各個角落逃出的難民，都向瀋陽集中，他們驚奇此地在當地人看來是褪色了的繁華，更驚奇地身受着嚇人一跳的物價。上館子小吃一頓，一算便是十數萬元，合法幣一二百萬，理髮一次合法幣廿萬，在他們看來是新聞。難民之中有很多是高等難民，地主，小商人，知識分子，他們帶來被「淸算鬥爭」的烙刑，也帶來精神恐懼症，這些人是精神脆弱的，自私，憂傷的人，一種痛苦的經驗似乎已在他們的心中生了「失敗主義」的根。共匪利用這一批人來散佈精神病菌，擾亂人的神經。最近吉林撤退，四平淪陷使瀋陽大受刺激。據長春來人說：前幾天，長春更是一夕數驚，夜半謠傳國軍撤退了，白日看見武裝精良的國軍，便又回復正常的寗靜，這些高等難民中，有很多是高梁米吃不慣的，他們吶喊「飢餓」了。</p>
<p>糧食問題使社會杌限不安。三月漲風使瀋陽人那一幅乾瘦貧血的面孔更嚴肅更憂愁了。這幾天，物價一日三跳，大米賣一萬一千元（合法幣十一萬元）一斤，已是談「米」色變。糧食飛漲的原因很多，最有力的刺激是搶購軍糧的結果，此外，流通券官價貶値爲一元對十元法幣，鉅額本票擾亂市面，沿途飢盜搶掠糧車，軍隊濫抓車馬，融雪道路泥潭等等，都是重要因素。眼看淸明時節到了，遙望曠野都是荒田，農民的種子被搶走，牛馬上前綫，或匿避城裏，再沒有辦法在自己的土地上播種，這一個農時荒廢的春天，正關係瀋陽的未來命運。</p>
<p>南糧北運的呼聲和銀鳥的吼聲一樣響澈雲齊，瀋陽正發愁「北人南運」，這是空中旅行的狂熟時代，中航公司在東北的生意最興隆，瀋陽兩個航空公司的門前熟鬧非凡，眞是車水馬龍，花月春風，淑媛閨秀，都要趕上江南的春天。於是小販，乞丐也聚集在這豪華的大門口。每天銀鳥的鐵翼使人興奮，但奇怪的是它拒絕帶郵件來，綠衣人半個月沒有到過我們的門口，「烽火連三月，家書抵萬金」。杜甫的詩句現在最能引瀋陽人的共鳴。</p>
<p>三月就要過去了，四月的東北可見靑秀。董市長提出綠化瀋陽的計劃，他的計劃不是以奇花異草裝飾瀋陽，而是以靑菜蘿葡綠化瀋陽。爲了準備迎接饑饉的歲月，董市長號召市民大家增產</p>
<p>每一塊荒蕪的田地，每一個空閑的庭院，都要開墾種植菜蔬穀類，假如有人不自己犂庭種豆，市長便令難民來開墾你的院子。董市長計劃以北陵東陵的荒地數千畝令難民去墾植，這些封建遺蔭的土地，每年仲春時候，林靑草綠，爲滿淸王朝保留着供人憑弔的秀色，今年的四月，頤到陵墓遊春的人，一定會羨慕生活在風景優美的自然環境中的難民吧！（本報記者趙展）</p>

<p>〔中央社南京廿四日電〕胡適發起北大校方募款一千億，建築蔡孑民紀念大禮堂，作北大五十週年祝壽禮物，在京北大校友狄膺余又蓀等紛起響應。胡適給各地北大校友函稱：一北京大學原稱「大學堂」，是歷代太學的繼承者。太學之制，起於漢武帝元朝五年（民國紀元前二零三五年西歷紀元前一二四年），我們很可以說北大已有兩千零七十二年歷史，是世界最老的大學。這算法雖總不免有點「賣老」，故我們向來只算光緒戊戌年（民國紀元前十四年）開辦的大學堂，是本校新生命的開始，到今年整整五十年。在校師生和各地校友，都想給北大做壽，所以有北大五十週年紀念的籌備紀念。方法大致分兩方面，一是用學術研究的成績做祝壽禮物，一是立一種五十週年紀念的公共建立。在學校成績方面，各學院已着手微集各學院的硏究成績，且已計劃各種學術刋物與講演。在紀念建立方面，我們曾徵求各地校友意見，大家都主張集中力量，募集捐款，建築一大禮堂，我們感覺一個可容一千幾百人的大禮堂，是北大今日最迫切需要，所以京滬平津各地校友都贊成集合全國校友力量，募集捐款，在沙灘區建造大禮堂，就呌做蔡孑民先生紀念大禮堂。我們曾請幾位建築工程專家設計，大致計算，建築與內部設備，需要國幣七百五十億到一千億，非有絕大力量不能擔負。我們大家都想此事，必須吾兄出來負責提倡，始有成功希望，所以我代表北大在校同人與各地校友，懇求吾兄慨允擔負此事，千萬請勿推辭」。</p>

<h3>輜汽遠征的收穫　王十選談籃球成功要點</h3>
<p>〔本報重慶航訊〕輜汽十六團籃球隊，從卅六年十月七日在貴陽與星光隊作第一戰起，至卅七年二月廿七日與黔體協隊作第六十一戰止，前後出征了五個多月，計去程四十六塲，回程十五塲，除敗於海華聯及大公隊外，餘皆獲勝，可算滿載而歸。</p>
<p>王士選副團長對於汽十六團隊在滬僅與華聯。大公隊各賽一次，頗感遺憾。他說：一個外埠的球隊遠征京·滬，確非易事，實力稍差的隊伍，將會吃力不討好，他對記者舉了很多例子解釋，尤對上海某報叙述贛光隊赴滬參加比賽，比爲「上課」，感慨良深。</p>
<p>王領隊坦白的申述了華聯與大公的優點。他的結論値得汴意，他以爲僅祗一是無聯或大公一隊，並不可怕，兩次作戰中，他已經體騐出自己隊伍的實力。綜合他的意見，一個成功的球隊，必須且備下列五項條件：第一，球員一定要體高，精力充沛。第二，熟練基本動作，假動作，無濟於事。第三，力求在基本原則下求變化。第四，防區內發揮小臂動作，旣不費力，又使對方不易防禦。第五，不計勝敗，多作比賽。所以，汽十六團隊在旅程中，除了搭乘車舟外，幾乎每天有一塲比賽，甚至有一天出賽三次。此次遠征的任務，可說是：（一）創專軍中體育基礎，（二）轉移軍中正當生活，（三）培養軍中體育人材。他始終認爲美國籃球員是世界上最標準的，身高是唯一的條件，除非中籃，否則球可永遠掌握在長子手中。</p>
<p>當本報記者問他：此次遠征，曾否吸收新隊員？他答稱：只有一位在貴陽的劉學寬，體特高，加以訓練，日後可以造就。</p>
<p>汽十六團隊將門票所得，捐贈上海體育記渚聯誼會及冬賑難民八千萬元外，另外還捐贈：（一）南京介壽堂球塲建築費六千萬元，（二）漢口汽九團體育塲建築費六千萬元，（三）杭州靑年團球塲建築費二千萬元，（四）貴陽監獄房所修理費七千萬元。愛好該隊的京，滬球迷，四月十六日，又可在南京勵志社運動塲發現他們的踪跡。届時，汽十六團籃球隊，將代表重慶區聯勤單位出席聯勤總部舉行的全面運動大會。（特派員歐陽醇）</p>

<h3>銀根仍未鬆弛　紗花布市續疲軟</h3>

<p>新醫與新藥醫事人才重質乎？重量乎？  蒼龍　　有許多鑒鑒於事實上的需要主張在很短的時間內儘量地培植大批的　事人才，來彌補日前中國醫事人才的缺乏。他們並且還說過：不管它是什麽出身，只要它能治病就行，因爲「有」總比「沒有」來得好些。　　　說這些話的人當然有他的見地和他的苦衷。我們放眼一看這箇幅員廣大的中華民國，就曉得中國的醫事人才是這麽少得可憐，同時我們也可以想像得到內地有多少人生了病得不到適當的療治而　死的慘劇。假使我們現在要按照原來的學年制度嚴格地培植一般醫事人才去塡補上述的缺憾，那就不知要等何年何月何日纔能够達到這種目的了。因此他們的主張也的確有相當的理由，我是十二萬分地贊成的。　　不過，這種「量的擴充」的主張雖然很有理由，然而在實施方面也還有許多的困難。因爲在目前的中國到處都是兵災人禍，迎一批老百姓都死光了逃光了，那還有什麼技術人才下鄕去送死呢？所以在這「量的擴充」運動中徒然的在城市裏增加了一批「吸血蟲」（有所本！）而已。我們在報紙上常常會看見許多非難醫者的文字，我們在耳頭耳尾也聽見了許多不利於醫者的傳言。這雖然不能肯定的說是量的擴充的結果，可是我們總不能否認說是沒有關係。有一位　廠商曾經吿訴我們，他們的藥品不情願賣給資格淺陋的醫生，因為他們不懂得醫藥的根本原理，出了事情又不曉得解救的法子。譬如說吧！我們只要看一看本期「飛矢貫腦」一文內所描寫的事實，就可充份地異露着無學學識者的可憐。　　有人當然會反詰我，「照你這樣的說法那你自己恐怕是了不起的醫者了」？吧那倒不是這樣子說的。世界上無論何人都不敢以「有學問」自稱自負，因爲學問是無止境的現在的科學日新月異，惟有努力不懈繼續前進，方能跟着潮流一同前進，否則一瞬間又被潮流所淘汰的。因此，我們眞正要明白，一個人如果根基打得不好的話，那就無論論如何要想學好也恐怕來不及了。而且，要想那批醫界裏的「抄小路者」去硏究學問，那就簡直等於夢想，因爲那批「抄小路者」不但不能硏究，而且也不想硏究，他們只想到如何如何的去謊騙病家，那還有工夫去研究那些撈什子呢？　　那末，「量的擴充」的結果是什麽呢？結果得弄得一團糟而已。我們不要舉出些什麽例子，來取厭於人，我們只要想想目前醫者地位的低落，就可以曉得其中的道理了。　　唉！醫事人才的「量的擴充」呀！有多少人藉了你的美名做下了無窮的罪惡？有多少人藉了你的美名去擴充他們的地盤，去築成他們的寳座”甲的保護  余正行　　廢物的代表　　每個人都有好美的心理，所以，凡是可以表現「美」的地方，無不盡量使其美化的，這樣才足够漂亮，摩登。請看，現在一些時髦小姐，交際明星，都把指甲修得尖尖的，指背上染上寇丹，加上油漆，色澤還十分動人。但是，這種裝飾，對人並沒有一點好處，不過是「美好」的一稱罷了。　　指甲爲皮膚的一部份，在人類爲一種不可缺乏的東西。指甲能保護柔嫩的指尖，輔助手指檢拾細小的物品。所以指甲的美，應以不失天然官能爲標準，否則，便爲廢物的代表了。　　指甲本體無生活力，所以無知覺，感覺。它是由堅硬光滑的透明物質所構成，這不過是我們所稱「留質」的一種形體。但是指甲根，和它的附着部份，是有神經，血管的。指甲的生長，不在指甲的邊緣，而是由根部生長出來。因爲根部供給新材料。一個整指田生出來，需要四個月的工夫。因其生長，進行極慢，每星期只能生出一英寸的三十二分之一。至於脚趾甲的生長述度，則更慢了。指甲根對於指甲的生長，和毛根對於毛髮的生長關係一樣。　　指甲根部極柔嫩，往往因爲血液中毒素，及神經的損傷而毀壞。假如指根部永久壞毁時，指甲即不再生了。要是指甲根有一部份被損壞時，指甲面上就生些凹溝和凸紋，常發現於患熱病或患重病以後。健康的指甲平滑無凸紋，且有天然光澤。　　指甲上的白綫或斑點，都是指床的組織細胞發生變化所形成。發生的原因，爲營養不良，或某種維生素及營養素的缺乏。但是，有時亦可能沒有特別的原因。指甲根部及兩側，應無肉刺及潮紅。對於皮膚加以注意，即可避免肉刺。　　危險的享受　　醫師檢査指甲時，有如看舌診脈相同的價値。健康的指甲是玫瑰淡紅色，是從下面的血色映出。帶藍色的指甲，往往由於心臟有病，或循環障礙。帶白色貧血的指甲，是由於不足的血液。粗糙的指甲，多因皮膚油脂分泌缺之。不整，短粗，或如蟲蝕的指甲，往往由於花柳病，癬病，或其他慢性皮膚病所造成。尙有別樣的指甲不齊，時時發現。　　患腫指病時，指甲皺中痛疼，潮紅，腫脹絕不可忽視，因此病多由全身的生理障礙，或由病菌的傳染而發生的。最多的原因是肉刺。肉刺在洗手後，皮膚尙十分溫軟時，用手指向根部推摩，並數以防腐劑。指甲附近的小瘡破爛處，治癒極慢，常延遲數星期，但比較的無痛。這也許有花柳病的可能，應該就診於專科醫師。在得傷寒，肺炎，結核病的過程中，指甲多會變形。在肺有慢性病患的時候，指甲多大且彎。指甲上有横脊時，每爲得過重病的後果。反復的患重症，在反復的時候，多生溝紋。因爲有許多疾病可以在指甲部傳染，所以大人先生們在浴堂沐浴後，有修脚的嗜好，這實在是危險的「享受」。　　最好的習慣　　手與外界接觸，時常容茹爲汚垢染髒，指甲的下面，尤其容易藏汚納垢。因此，手要常洗，洗手時務將指甲也洗乾凈。有人雖然時常洗手，但是指甲內仍然藏有污垢。這一面是由於一指甲太長，另一面，却因爲未密切注意到。因爲指甲不淸潔，當吃食食物時，指甲中的微生物，便會隨着食物，由口進入體內，這實在是危險的事。洗淸指甲，不但是健康的行爲，同時也可以增加美觀。　　每天起床時，許多人只注意到洗臉，漱口，並沒有注意到指甲，這是錯誤的。記着，在飯前無論如何，要洗手，也就是要淸除指甲中的汚垢。當工作，遝動以後，手指特別容易骯懈，指甲中汚穢的東西，自然會增加，這時當立即洗手。若果到什麽地方遊玩後，出門以前，或睡覺以前，能將指甲淸潔了，那是最好的習慣。　　清潔指甲一定要作得澈底。實在說，指甲不是隨隨便便洗一　，便淸潔了的。用一個小刷子，刷毛不要太硬，指尖上塗些肥皂，在溫水中，反覆的刷刷指甲，這便可以清潔了。如果可能的話，用一塊軟質的木棍，一端削成筆尖狀，另一端較大，削成斜面，用來剔除指甲中的垢物，這是十分好的。比金屬的剪刀，刀片除垢好多了，而且沒有將指甲割破的危險。指甲根部的皮膚，容易起刺，應當在洗手後，皮膚還溫軟的時候，用食指的指甲向根部推一推，但切勿用剪刀。　　必需的工作　　剪指甲也是一件必需的工作。指甲不可長得太長，太長不但容易藏垢，而且十分難看。剪指甲時，第一，要將所有的指甲剪得一樣長，這樣便齊整美觀。第二，亦不可太短，不要傷肉。第三，要剪得整齊光滑。剪脚趾甲時，最好剪成一條直綫，微彎亦可。切不要將脚趾甲的兩側，剪得太短。脚趾甲兩側剪得太短時，容易使指甲長入肉內。　　對於脚趾，除開照手指那樣的保護外，淸潔也十分重要。還要穿寬大些的鞋，鞋尖頭，對脚趾是不好的，應該避免。脚也需要常洗，留心淸潔。醫學新聞新殺蟲劑  劉遂生　　—較DDT效力大四倍—　　頃據美國橡皮公司（United　States　Rubber　Co．）宣稱：〔一種新殺蟲劑名呌「Synklor」者，業已發明。試騐結果，知其效力比DDT約强四倍，毒殺千萬成羣的蚱蜢，尤見特效，液態或粉末，均可應用。無論觸及或入胃，均呈毒性。麻醉效騐，非常神速。幸對於人類所呈的毒性，幷不强於DDT云。」使癱瘓病人妊娠之特種裝置　（聯合社）產後提早起床  謝筠壽　　吾國婦女在分娩以後，往往須臥床一月，謂之滿月，已成習慣。此一因產後疲勞，固應休養；二因子宮未曾復元，過早起床，有子宮下埀或脫出之危險；且顯露不盡，易因勞動而增加。除貧家產婦，無人照料，迫不得已，只好提早起床以外，大都嚴守滿月之習慣，就是東西洋各國，也多如此。可是目下漸漸兒有些　動。有人主張，不妨提早起床。但提早起床施行的目的，因爲產婦過於長期仰臥以後，往往變成子宮後傾後屈，尤以膀胱常常充滿的人更甚，一方面因爲久無運動，不與新鮮空氣及日光接觸，易使精神萎糜，面色蒼白，胃口不開，或者引起肺栓塞，血栓性靜脈炎等，但這是極少的，所以凡是產後無特別情形的產婦，無須過於嚴守滿月的規定，可以提早起床，如果有發熱或其他情形的產婦，那非遵醫師的囑咐，休養不可。雙靑樓談醫隨筆  雙靑樓主　　（一）醫術神奇一鉗喪三命　　德國有一位世界聞名的產科專家Albert　Doederein氏，有一天正在醫院裏巡閱實習醫師的工作情形，忽然看見一位初出茅廬的產科醫師正用着「深處產鉗術」狠命地兩手握着產鉗想把難產的嬰孩鉗拉出來。他連忙跑過去，把那位醫師痛駡了一頓。他說：「深處產鉗術」是不能隨便使用的，必定要在適合於它的條件中方可使用。你現在搞的什麼？是不是想殺人嗎」？跟着他就說了一篇故事給隨從的人們聽：「鄉間有一位產婦正患難產，肚皮痛了三天還沒有把小孩養下來。她的丈夫看見她痛苦的情形，心裏非常焦急，到處亂跑，想找尋一位產科醫師來解救他的太太的難產。結果是被他找到了一位專門產科的醫生。他誠惶誠恐地領了那位醫師進到產房裏去，惟恐因爲招待不週到，觸怒了那位醫生，不肯替他的太太接生。而那位醫師呢，態度有點泰然自得甚有把握的樣子。他把產婦診察了一回，便對她的丈夫說：「非用深處產鉗術不可」。她的丈夫此時六神無主又無醫學常識，當然滿口答應了。於是那位大醫生把自己的兩只袖子高高地捲起，然後在他出診皮包裏拿出一副產鉗鉗來。他把產鉗拆開來分作兩半，在很緊張和很困難的情形中把兩半片的產鉗放入產婦的子宮深處，又把那兩半片的產鉗拚攏來然後用足氣力想把嬰孩拉出來。大槪是因爲痛得太厲害的緣故，產婦大聲呼痛並且要求停止手術，可是醫生不肯。於是產婦大哭大呌，兩手亂抓，雙淚直流，然而那位醫生還是不放手。這是產婦的丈夫站在醫生的背後只急得雙脚亂跳不知如何是好。忽然間「剝」的一聲，「碰」的一聲，「唉喲」一聲，立刻就一陣大亂。原來那個嬰孩是被醫生用產鉗拉出來了，可是因爲那位醫生用了十二分的氣力，狠命地把嬰孩拉了出來，順着一刹那的急勢，將沉重的產鉗敲到站在醫生背後的產婦男人頭上，因此那個男人被敲死了。同時那個產婦也在這一聲「唉喲」之中魂歸天上。至於那個鉗出來的嬰孩呢，早已被產鉗壓扁了腦売和他母親的子宮以及其他內臟一古腦兒拋棄在地上了。於是這個產的一家三口人就在這位醫師的神奇醫術中喪了命。」　　（二）飛矢貫腦偏過莽郎中　　德國漢堡是一個歐洲的大商埠，它的人口相當的多，而商業也相當的繁盛。德國的政府爲此特別加以注意，極力設法使它繁榮，尤其對於漢堡大學更其使它在「質」和「量」兩方面加倍的充實起來。因此漢堡大學在國際方面非常著名，世界各國的學子負笈來遊的也不少。我在漢堡的時候就有世界各國來此留學的學生不少。因爲學生的國籍非常複雜，所以它的份子也不見得齊整。老實說：有許多人是想學習些東西回去的，又有許多人是想藉此鍍金來的，還有一批人呢，那不渦想藉留學的美名來玩玩罷了。在我讀書的同一時間中最使我不能忘懷的就是那位南美洲某國某機關送來的白醫師。他本來是個德國人，在本國醫校畢業之後在一次偶然的機會中被人介紹到船上去做船醫。他坐的船是到南美洲去的，倚仗他口才的便給不久他就担任了在南美某國的一家美國煤油公司裏充任醫師。他所屬的範圍相當的大，他也相當的煩忙，因此也很得那家公司的信任。他是特地被那家公司遣送到漢堡來進修的。他身材魁梧，相貌豐偉，口才又相當的好，用掉兩個錢也滿不在乎。因此他在我們一羣留學生中是相當吃香的。不過，他到底是一個流轉天涯的冒險家，不是一個眞正硏究學術的醫學家。雖則他一本正經地叙述他所經過的許多奇聞異事，並且拿出許多實地攝影的照片來做證據，可可從醫學的立塲來說，他不過是一個醫學方面的投機家和冒險家罷了。下面一段是他所叙述的故事，其中所攝的照片也經我親眼看見的。這眞是天下之大，無奇不有了　　「有一天的下午，我正在一所靠近古森林的衛生辦事處裏休息。那時天氣相當燠熱，大家都有點昏昏欲睡的樣子。忽然間有人拍門，一個土著的　臉侍者跑來吿訴，說有一位被箭傷的人現在抬在手術室中求治。我連忙跑去看看，果然在手術室裏躺着一個身材高大的南美土人。他頭部出血很多，在左右兩頰有一枝箭矢穿過。那枝箭還穿在腦裏，我們也看得見左右兩頰露出來的部份。我當下大吃一驚，心想他那能還不死呢？於是我問他受傷的經過情形。他說：「在古森林裏（按南美洲有許多古森林，年代久遠不可査考，其中還有許多未開化的土人，以食人肉爲家常便飯）我偶然地在獵取一只麋鹿。忽然的一陣箭簇飛來，我陡然地部覺着頭內一陣麻木，用手一撫頭摩着有一枝箭簇穿在腦部。我駭急而奔，狂馳了二十餘里方始不支踣地。現在給家裏的人一路抬來，已經覺得體力恢復了許多，只是頭痛欲烈，今請你醫師費心一治，眞是感恩不盡了。」我當下沉吟半晌，心裏非常躊躇。我幾曾診治過這種病症？我幾時讀過醫治這種病症的書籍？不單只關於腦部開刀的手術我不知，就連稍爲完備一點的消毒設備也沒有。那有什麼法子呢？好罷，我就盡我的能力試試看。於是我把他左右兩頰的箭枝用碘酒再三消毒，然後用力握着箭簇的一端把它抽取出來。可是一霎時血液肖穿孔內飛射，而受傷者也就在慘呼聲中逝世了。我事後雖然很懊悔我那種種法子，可是除除此我也別無良法。你們看，這就是一矢　腦的照片，我至今還有點難過呢。」　　我們聽了他所說的話又看了他所指給的照片，大家都嘩然地狂笑一陣。於是這位白醫生就在一種苦笑的情形中退出課室了。多發性神經炎之原因  梁俊青譯　　關於多發性神經炎（Polyneuritis）之原因，雖有種種理論，然而至今尙無定讞。茲爲使讀者明瞭起見，特將本病分列爲二大類如下：　　（一）慢性發生者其發生情形甚爲遲緩，往往起始於不知不覺之中，僅有輕微之疼痛及肢體之異樣感覺（如發麻）而已。此時若延醫診治，亦無任何病態可得。其後經過悠長之歲月，方始發覺於知覺神經方面有種種病態，而在運動神經方面則尙付闕如。其最足令人注意者，則惟有肌肉方面之萎縮而已。此種慢性發生之多發性神經炎可發生於任何一種傳染病中，固不能目爲一種獨立性神經炎病也。　　（二）眞性沉重性之多發性神經炎此症之發作也突然而來，且甚劇烈，往往兼有肌肉萎縮性之麻痺及深部感覺神經之劇痛。以前之學者因其性質之劇烈，故特命名爲假性脊髓癆型之多發性神經炎。嗣經多數學者之研究，始知此症與各種傳染病以及嚴重之體內中毒作用甚有關係，例如患白喉病之後往往有之，而長年酗酒者亦可患之也。據Wagner-Jauregg二氏報吿，人體因受酒精之長期戕害，遂致菌毒容易侵入神經釀成多發性神經炎云。嗣後有Pette及Bannwarth氏者則認爲多發性神經之發生由於體內神經之過敏現象所致云。　　雖上述二種症象微有異同，而其侵襲於各部神經也則一。而予對於「過敏現象爲其原因」之說尤有不敢贊同之處，茲特根據筆者個人方面之臨牀經驗敢爲讀者一述，藉知所謂過敏現象者固非本病之原因也。　　時當一九四一年秋至一九四二年春間，德國東綫戰地之野戰病院中曾住有急劇性之多發性神經炎症患者多人。病者之兩腿皆麻木不仁，絲毫不能動轉。至於腦神經方面則鮮有發炎症象。吾人根據其發病情形，約可分述爲二：　　（一）此類之病者多半屬於新發。初起即有眼球調節作用之失常及眼球肌肉之麻痺。患此者多半已經曾患白喉病症。　　（二）第二類之病者與前者大不相同。其病症之起始往往已在數星期之前，其嚴重之發作時期亦已不可究詰，而其腦部方面亦無任何障礙現象。此類病者皆自東南面戰綫之急遽推進中移送過來，且在其以往之病歷中亦從未患有白喉病症。然而病者皆作甚急劇之多發性神經炎症象，其中且有不少患背脊髓前角炎之症象者。至其最足令人詫異者則爲所有之症象有時且與傳染性之小兒麻痺症極爲相似。而其最初診治本病之醫師且有似爲傳染性小兒麻痺症之按語。可見此病之起初情形固爲一種傳染病之姿態，及後經過相當之時日方始轉變爲多發性神經炎也。　　本病之經渦時期甚爲悠長，往往需時數月。且其以後之結果，亦不易觀察，蓋戰地之病兵不斷地逐漸向內遷移，故無從繼續觀察其全部情形也。此類病人中亦有死亡者，大約皆爲心臟袋弱所致云。　　惟其最足令人注意者乃爲是類病症之驟然發作，死亡率甚高，病情亦甚嚴重，且有多數人同罹此症，（不但德軍及德國之同盟軍有之，即如蘇聯之軍隊中亦有甚多患之者）而其本地人士則罕有患之者。至於究竟其地之人有無因免疫作用存在而不易傳染此病者，則一時不易解答之矣。　　根據上述之急性傳染情形，吾可斷言此病爲一種傳染病。至其病菌爲何則尙不能答覆，要皆濾過性毒之一種耳。吾人以症情推測，可以有下列之三種解說：　　A·多發性神經炎之細菌與背脊髓前角炎（即指傳染性小兒麻痺症）者完全相同。　　B·上述二種病症之細菌完全不同，但在某種情形中可以兩種病症同時發生，所以有上述之種種奇異症象。　　C·兩種不同之病症可以偶然在一起發生。　　惟以予個人之觀察則此上述之兩種病症似乎甚有密切之關係。蓋據Kauders氏於一九三六年報吿，患小兒性麻痺症者可用瘧疾原蟲移殖於病者血管內使其常常發熱，結果可得痊愈之希望。Poetzl氏亦曾報告，以瘧疾原蟲移殖於多發性神經炎病者血液內，亦可使其常常發熱面病愈也。</p>

<p>自由談守財奴  靖文　　以與魯迅郭沬若等人關係而得躋身中國文化界的日本書商內山完造，平時亦喜寫寫雜文小品之類，其思想就一商人言，亦可說是相當前進，且因渠在我國（上海）已久，故有時對於我國人情風土的見解，每有其獨到之處。　　據彼言我國人乃世界上最懂得儲蓄的民族，且謂我國人民幾乎個個會開銀行，其所舉實例即我國人都喜戴金戒指，而其用意並非僅在裝飾，而在以備不時之需，因其隨時可以變爲現款也。　　此言仔細玩味，確有幾分道理。因歐美人與日本人雖亦有戴戒指者，但多數僅作爲一種紀念性的飾物，例如訂婚或結婚戒之類，且其材料亦絕少用純粹黄金者。美國雖有拜金主義國之議，然美國農民以其餘款購金戒指以作隨時可變賣之動產者，則恐怕很少見。　　考我國人民所以特別重視黄金，原因當爲我國並非產金國，黄金本身旣是貴金屬，又爲國際貿易的最後結算工具，而我國在國際貿易上又一向居於入超地位，自無怪黄金要受國人重視了。歷來帝王的宮殿稱金鑾殿，其所在地構紫金城或金都，都不外顯示豪華和貴不可攀的意思。紅樓夢中薛寳釵身上的那塊金鎖片，就曾因此將林黛玉活活氣死。俗語更有所謂一兩黄金四兩福，更將黃金的身價抬高到不可思議。　　近年來黄金的身價不僅未見降减，且幾已成爲一切財產價値的最後標準，不過金戒指之類的飾物則已變得非常大衆化，向來戴不起金戒指的勞工和老板娘之流，現在有的幾乎戴得手指都彎不轉了。如果黄金的普遍確能代表藏富於民的話，則我國民生經濟的富裕情形，恐怕就連黄金國的美國人亦要自嘆勿如。　　事實自然不是如此，金戒指的普遍化，不外如內山所說的是一種變相儲蓄而已，其反面意思就是表示人民對當前幣制缺乏信心，對整個的經濟前途表示懷疑。本來可以用來買地造屋或用於其他生產用途的錢，現在都凍結在千百人的手指頭上或私人的保險箱中。　　目前二十哉左右的靑年，也許從來沒有見到過一種呌做「撲滿」的東西吧？但在三十歲以上的人，大概都曾玩過這種東西的。這是一種黄泥燒製的「兒童銀行」，大小恰如普通的蟋蟀盆，樣子則有幾分像現在也已不大流行的平頂瓜皮帽，不過下面有底，上面開有一個恰好可投入一個銅元的狹　。這就是從前父母們誘導兒童養成儲蓄習慣的兒童銀行。　　積財不如積德，這雖然是一句勸人爲善的好話，但人人能懂得怎樣正常的積財，也不能說是壞事。國家和社會財富的積聚，一大半就有賴於人民財富的積聚。所謂國富民强，也不外是這個這理。守財奴雖然不可爲訓，但儲蓄的行爲並非就是養成守財奴的主因。　　就眼前的社會經濟情形言，儲蓄平已變成了愚人的代名詞，例如現在的兒童們就根本不知道有儲蓄的這回事。自銅板消滅後，「撲滿」早就成爲博物館中的東西了。而且做父母的亦無法誘導兒童養成儲蓄的習慣。例如去年一百槐錢一支的棒糖，現在就要近萬一支。假使兒童們把他去年積下的糖果錢留到今年用，準會半根棒糖都買不到了。因此現在的兒童們也都知道到手的錢應該趕快用掉。　　然而社會上的守財奴却並不因此减少，而且是更多了。現在一般重視黄金的觀念，並不是意味人民財富的積聚，而祗是守財奴們用以保障財富的工具。人人渴想自己都能點石成金，而其動機則全在滿足個人無窮的私慾，這與往昔以儲蓄方法將個個人積聚的財富用之於增殖社會財富是根本異趣的。試看最近勸募救濟特捐的法令方公佈，以黄金美鈔計値的守財奴們早在想法逃避了。這足見以黄金藏富於民的話是靠不住的。內山完造所說中國人一個個人都會開銀行，也祗能說是對我們的一種諷刺而已。蕭伯納  冷冷　　蕭伯納某天受一個美貌馳名　歐美的女伶糾纏，她說：　　「假使我和你結了婚，生出來的孩子，面貌像我，頭腦像你，你想那孩子豈不是才貌雙全的人嗎？」　　「萬一頭腦像你，面貌像我，那眞是不得了哩！」蕭伯納微笑地回答。　　蕭伯納喜歡自捧自讚，好奇立異。有一次一位美國貴婦晤見他，向他寒喧說：　　「蕭先生，久仰大名。」　　蕭伯納却不客氣地回答：　　「你久仰我的，究竟是那一個大名？因爲我的大名共有七個。」　　他自己承認有七種名譽，計開：哲學家，小說家，社會家，批評家，政治家，戲劇家，及宗教家。　　有一次蕭伯納與一個蘇聯小姑娘談話，臨別時囑咐她說：　　「你回去吿許全國人，你會經與全世界最偉大的人物講過話，這是罕有的光榮。」　　蕭伯納在上海出席孫夫人宴會，餐後在陽台上休息；那時明亮的腸光由黑雲間放出，正射在他的白髮蒼髯的長臉上，來賓中一位說：　　「蕭先生眞好福氣，可以在上海看見太陽。」　　「不，這是太陽福氣，可以在上海看見蕭伯納。」蕭伯納竟大言不慚地回答。記劉喜奎  陳詒先　　上海坤伶演劈紡，演戲迷傳，轟動一時，戲園天天客滿，觀者購票不得，至有黑市票出現。然以余所看三十年來坤伶，論藝，以雪艷琴爲第一；論色，以劉喜奎爲第一。民國初年，喜奎在故都三慶園出演，一日散戲出來，門口一靑年抱之接吻，喜奎大呌，警察將靑年帶入署中，罰款了事，人人反羨慕之，以爲艷福。名士易哭廠羅癭公諸人捧喜奎甚力，喜奎登台，哭廠納首懷中，大呼「我的娘，我的媽，我老早來伺候你了。」觀此，可見喜奎眞一尤物，爲人傾倒，竟至於此。著世載堂剳記之劉禺生，有洪憲紀事詩，其中一苜：「騾馬街南劉二家，白頭詩客戲生涯，入門脫帽狂呼母，天女嫣然一散花。」即咏此事也。　　喜奎之色旣甲天下，其藝尤冠一時，捧之者爭風吃醋，甚者組社結黨，以相競爭，喜奎不願，有一自白書，其中有「夫吠影吠聲，無禮之毀，固喜奎所不任受，即評姿評色，輕薄之譽，亦喜奎所不願聞。君等其可以休美！」又曰：「夫婚姻自由，國有明令，此神聖不可侵犯之主權，而竟有某某，横施以干涉之詞，破壞法律，蔑棄人道之罪，某某豈能免乎？抑主持輿論者，固應如是乎？其他污　私德之事多端，喜奎自問無他，故亦在所弗計，然以爲若是之人，而亦厠身輿論界，喜奎雖不肖，亦爲我大中華國之輿論界放聲一哭也。」　　捧喜奎者，有名士，有學生，有大官，有巨賈，皆有野心。而喜奎竟嫁與崔承熾，崔年四十餘，在參謀部僅任第一局局長，非大官，其家爲河北武淸縣一中產階級，又無多金，喜奎竟心許之，可見其擇人而事，另具眼光，與現代之時髭坤伶不同。尤難能可貴者，喜奎以妙齡絕色嫁崔承熾，不數年崔死，喜奎閉門守　，空房獨處，以一伶人而有舊女子之美德。約在民國十七八年，故都報載　刦安定門謝家胡同崔宅，孀婦崔劉氏損失珠寳金錢不少，可以爲證。　　喜奎不負承熾，據余所聞聞，承熾亦爲一眞男子。承熾本已娶婦多年，旣與喜奎有約，其家人在順天時報登一啓事，聲明承熾兼祧兩房，其時參謀部次長陸錦，亦爲心醉喜奎之一人，處心積慮，必欲破壞崔劉兩人之結合，以順天時報與參謀總長張懷芝間看，言部中屬員竟有此違犯法律之事。　芝年已七十餘，居然不糊塗，答此乃人家私事，我們不必管。陸錦仍不甘心，一日向總統徐世昌回公事，趁便提起此事，徐不知陸別有用心，令參謀部査辦。懷芝召承熾；言：「此事旣已通天，我不能回護，你要保存局長位置，趕快與喜奎毁約，如不應毁約，最好自己辭職，兩條路　自擇之。」承熾即辭去參謀部事以娶喜奎。事後張懷芝向人言：「小陸要我惜刀殺狗，我豈肯爲。」蓋崔承熾小名狗子也。　　劉喜奎爲南皮縣人，與崔承熾爲河北同鄕，幼習歌曲，首次登台在天津，　從候俊山金月梅游，藝力　進，候即梆子名伶十三旦，金爲坤伶，一度曾嫁鄭孝胥。喜奎在故都成名時，從易哭廠學詩文，所作多可誦，茲錄其兩詩於後；「臺空玉鏡今難卜，宮守丹砂祗自修，誰解砝碔溷珠玉，銀河皎皎淚空流」。「人言　有傾城貌，自愧家無負郭田，棠桂不花　早萎，拼將色相奉靈　」。「新疆」新釋  東方　　孫越畸先生以前在重慶大學演講時，曾對「新疆」之「疆」字作了如下的妙釋：「新疆有三山：曰阿爾泰山，日天山，曰崑崙山。三山皆横行而成爲『三』；阿爾泰山與天山間有準喀爾盆地在焉，天山與崑崙山間有塔里木盆地在焉，此二盆地皆爲良田，故乃成「　」矣。此三山二田如無武力保衛，恐爲外人所侵入，故有「弓」矢象徵武器，以「弓」守『土』，合而爲一，乃得『疆』字。」教師萬歲  心鵑　　祖父去世距今將近十年了；祖父在世時中遇秀才，做過官，也坐過「學堂」。所謂「學堂」就是私塾。祖父中年以後得了半身不遂的病，一條腿成了殘廢，得了廢疾後才掛冠歸里，絳帳踝徒。在我們鄉下，凡是讀過七八年以上的書的人，無事可做，就以「坐館」爲謀生的末一條路，或者竟像先祖父那樣得了廢疾，不能再做什麽大事，於是坐了冷板凳終老一生。　　事實上不獨我們鄉下為然，恐怕到處都是如此，做敎師成了文人末一條的出路。即以眼前而論，有多少做敎師的人，是由師範學校「正途」出身的呢？我可以說很多中小學敎師都是找不到別的相當的事情可做，才把敎書作爲他的職業的，因此師資低落，良莠不齊，自然是意料中事了　　當然，敎書生涯在高物價壓迫下的今日是十分艱苦的，但敎師生活淸苦是事實，而師資低落，流品莠雜，也是事實。我曾目一睹一家小學校，四位男敎員有三一位是小抖亂型的「飛機頭」！　朋友對我說了一家中學校的一位「海派敎員」的趣事；那位「海派敎員」洋裝畢挺，頭髮梳得精光，手上還戴了一枚鑽戒，說話時有翹大姆指的習慣。一次，有一個學生犯了規則，「海派敎員」加以體罰後，還問學生：「儂阿服貼？」學生自然連聲「服貼」不迭。　　敎師是學生的表率，試想爲人師者如此，我們又怎能望他敎出一批好學生來？寫到這裏，順手在案頭檢到一份「敎師萬歲」的電影說明書，爲之黯然者再！逍遥花  陳慎言　　力圖補救　（一〇九）　　渚　廳了肖相這些話，心裏早明白了幾分，因問道：「姑丈，你用什麽法子把我們兩個調閒呢？」肖　聽了，很得意的，先　頭點一點，然後伸一個指頭向空中畫一個圓圈，說道：「我為你們，很費一番苦衷，你是有婦之夫，不能　娶綺紈，可是你們交情已經成熟，在情勢之下，已不能斷絕關係。你要娶綺紈，必須和你太太離婚，人家何罪，你把她休棄，在人情上，是說不過去的。不過當時我若把這話吿訴你，你未必肯聽。我若去勸綺紈，她一定怪我多事，我想到最後，只有吿訴你父親去。」渚齋聽到這裏，不由一呆。暗想，父親已經知道了，何以對我一句話也沒說呢？正要問時，肖柏又接着說道：「我爲了你這事，可大傷腦筋了，我知道你父親的脾氣是很急的，若要把你們情形全吿訴他，他一定把你呌來揍死了，我只可慢慢婉轉說，只說到十分之二三，你父親已經氣得不得了，後來我替你父親想許多法子，呌你父親親到綺紈家裏去，把你家的情形，全吿訴綺紈，綺紈很聰明，能諒解你父親的話，才與你斷絕關係。她以後結交軍界的什麼朋友，這未嘗不是她一番苦心，要斷絕你的牽掛。她總算聰明，這樣一來，保全了她的前途，也保全了你的前途。你看怎麽樣？」渚　聽了這一遍話，心裏難過極了，再也支持不住，一個身子，往下一歪，躺在榻上，愈想愈難過，覺得綺紈太委曲了，完全是自己害的她，幾乎弄出人命！想着，把手帕拿出來，在眼睛上擦了擦。肖柏說道：「你何必哭呢，這沒什麼可傷心的。你試想想，以你的薪俸，以你的財產，你能娶得起她嗎？你能供養她一輩子嗎？綺紈是個時髭女子，最好揮霍的，你把她娶來，過了幾個月，爲了經濟關係，彼此發生意見，到了那時候，該怎麼辦？那只有兩條路可走，一個你得想法努力掙錢，供她揮霍，但是以你的能力，是不可能的。第二個辦法，你只有蹲在家裏，由她出去演戲，你須仰她的鼻息，你能受得了嗎？」弔新登  施叔範　　晚過三溪口，星明地　　，菽影搖左右，葉大風中戰，當時殺伐魂，隱隱如可見。破路不容趾，顛躓輿人怨，初更入新登，四門燈火斷，慘肅過行軍，但有履聲亂。廿一月上遲，城頭剛露半，霜氣接燒痕，黄如詞客面，月瘦草轉肥，長得焦土徧，頹垣放菸花，廢灶苞蘿綻，萬瓦盡邱墩，城空何有店？浩刦憶夏五，寇來崇朝陷，長街不洗刀，殺人以爲玩，毒　蒸天河，水沸石亦　，至今腐憐多，天寒比燭艷！幽幽穿荒郭，惻惻回頭看，遠村一犬吠，行客渾身顫，血　畫分明，勃然更按劍。相人術  翼雲　　「人不可以貌相，水不可以斗量，」此一語是駁斥好爲皮相之論者。江湖家善觀氣色之談，雖亦時有微中，然其理渺茫，未可憑信，惟有實地經驗，察言觀色，以判斷其人之邪正智愚，可交與否，果能細心體認，似較信而有徵。孔老夫子說過：「視其所以，觀其所由，察其所安，」復謂以此相人，人自無法隱瞞，故又說「人焉廋哉？人焉廋哉？」廋字就是隱瞞之意，就是說以上文「視」「觀」「察」三種相法相人，人何能瞞蔽？孟子也有一種相法，說是「莫良於眸子（眸子就是眼珠）。眸子不能掩其惡，胸中正，則眸子瞭然，胸中不正，則眸子眊然。」瞭是目光明亮，眊是目光不甚明亮，這種相法，據宋儒解釋，說人胸中正，則神精而明（即瞭）；不正，則神散而昏（即眊）。可見是在目之精神上注意的。吾嘗見農人養豬，亦曾注意相法，能相定某豬易於肥大，某豬則否，其言確實應驗。吾家喜養蟋蟀，歷經多年，亦能相出某蟋蟀善鬥，某蟋蟀則否，絲毫不爽，是知古之伯樂，善於相馬，百不失一，並非欺人之談。而以人相人，自當比以人相獸相蟲，尤爲眞切，茲將經臉所及，與得之友人指示，及在書報上參考得來的，歸納得數種原則，列舉如次：（一）靜默寡言，目光尖銳，隨處留神者，工於心計。（二）笑臉隨時變幻，每發一言，必指天畫地，那必是一個市儈。（三）沈靜冷僻，而少言笑，凡事淡然處之，那必是一個久經滄海，飽歷風塵的人。（四）沈靜而活潑，態度溫和，時然後言；樂然後笑，必是一個精明强幹，才識優良的人。（五）時時炫耀自己的才能是決非有高深學問者。（六）說話吞吐不決者，決不會成大事。（七）說大話做小事的人，只可利用而不可重用。（八）說小話不做事的人，雖可近而不可新。（九）雙肩緊聳者，必性急而負責，但不能治人治事。（十）無論何事，皆喜插言，又喜輕舉妄動者，那必是浮躁之人。（十一）言寡而必中的，溫和樸實，是必學識優深，修養有素者。（十二）無論何語，均不駁回，而其發言，則均迎合對話人之心理，此種人只可泛交，不可托以心腹。　　以上各節，不過略舉管見，如蒙卓識之士，多多在本報賜敎，俾得觀人處世之法，於社會似亦有益。西洋人看中國  何苦　　嘗論西洋人看中國，不出於一個狹小的範圍，如「龍，小瓜皮帽，摺扇，寳塔……」之類。我不能說西洋不是沒有明智之士，洞悉中國現階段的情形，但大部份人對於中國的瞭解，還逗留於民國紀元前數年的時代，則是事實。其間可以原諒的地方，我想還是在於中國方塊字的與西洋蟹形文字大相異體的緣故，使他們想用文字的媒介，來瞭解中國，不免如隔靴搔癢，霧裏看花一般。自作聰明之士對於中國方塊字尙未十分嘵暢之前，想懂得中國的一切，正如緣木求魚一般，終究是弄成笑話而已。　　例如最近皇冠雜誌有一段補白，就使我們中國人看了要啼笑皆非。茲先將該補白照譯如下：　　「中國人　Crisis（危機）　一個字，用的兩個字眼組成，其一是Danger（危險），另一字爲Opportunity（機會）。」　　這補白的題目是「二而一者」，意思是中國人對於「危機」一的看法，固然是一個危險的事實一，但未始不是機會主義者的進身一之階。不管他們這種議嘲的看法一是否合乎中國現實，但爲了證明這「危機」兩個中國字起見，皇冠雜誌特在補白右方加上了兩個筆劃不大到架的中國字，細細一看，乃是「轉機」二字。用「轉機」來纏夾爲「危機」，其間相差不知有幾。如其不把兩個中國字寫出來，倒是一段完整無疵的補白，一加兩個中國字上去，反而露出了一隻西洋人看中國的馬脚，正同於把「危機」纏到「轉機」一般。　　皇冠雜誌的銷路已在二百五十萬份以上，其所影響於中國以外一般讀者的程度，也可想而知。假使從這樣的「二而一者」來看中國，固然使中國人覺得啼笑皆非，也不免使想瞭解中國的西洋人多增一層　　在這東方古國上面了。巴州九景  辛元　　巴州，是個好地方，那裏有淳樸善良的人，也有淳樸幽麗的景緻。筆者在巴州住了九年，且將記憶中的追記下來吧。　　先說「洪崖滴翠」，洪崖即是洪崖廂的洪崖洞，每當夏秋之交，洞上有泉水，零星滴下，滴在靑苔上，別有一番景色。再有「龍門浩月」，龍門浩在南岸，相傳龍門浩的兩個龍門大篆字，還是宋朝紹興年間的古蹟，那地方的永脈横湧在兩旁，恰像一個月亮，所以有此稱呼。第三處是「金碧　靑」，據說明朝有一個姓張的知府曾經在金碧台上造了　一個金碧山堂，堂的四圍十分別緻，在堂內可以飲酒下奕，俯瞰江城，有人說那時張知府曾種了不少的桂樹，所以一到秋天，桂子飄香，香氣洋溢於遠近，有金碧流靑之譽，到了淸代，桂樹都被砍去了，因把他呌做金碧殘香，以作憑弔之意，後人把這香字念別了，便成了現在的金碧殘靑了。第四是「巴水宵燈」，就是附近一帶的水，流行曲折，有如巴字一般，在夜間，看兩岸的燈火反映在水上，煞是有趣，因此重慶的夜景便有了此一美名。五是「黄葛晚渡」，這是珊瑚壩一帶的晚景，六是「海棠烟雨」，在海某溪地方，每逢細雨時，那如絲如烟的毛毛雨在溪流中飄漾，實添不少詩情畫意。那裏有一條街，便呌做烟雨段。第七景是「華鎣雪　」，這是形容華鎣山上下雪時的一幅景色。八是「歌樂靈音」，相傳李冰父子導水後，曾在歌樂山上小住，每當日出，晚間皆以琴作伴，琴音乃得響澈四外，後來因爲這地方的竹子每當微風時也颯颯作聲，因而這地帶便也成了名勝，這也是川人敬念李冰父子的一番表示。九景是「浮圖夜雨」，浮圖是浮岡關，勝利前年才改名爲復與關的便是。關內有夜雨寺，寺中壁上有靑石，每天的早晨都很潤濕，好像夜間下雨一般，因有此名。　　除此九勝以外，尙有「雲篆風淸」，「橘井峽猿」，「縉嶺雲霞」等幾景，合稱爲一十二名勝，但近十數年來，亦不過是名存而已，其實已是斷垣殘壁，狼狽不堪，除去問當地的老者外，年輕的小伙子還不能背出娘家來呢。至於雪景，筆者在川九年，始終無福見過一次，去歲朋友來信說：「今歲四川大雪。」聞之不勝憾憾。至於黄葛夜渡這一景色，則在返京乘機路過時，才得欣賞一番，但也平淡的很，空存美名罷了！燈塔  念傳　　一片孤舟掙扎在汪洋大海之中，四周是無際的黑暗，祗有灰白的浪花打擊着牠，可怕的嘯聲恫嚇着牠，絕望佔住了每個人的心情，在這生與死的決爭裏，他們看到了一絲燈光，一座矗立在黑暗中的高塔。你能想像那時的情境嗎？瘋狂的吼聲，伴着瘋狂的喊聲，僅僅這麽一點希望，使他們不屈服的向前生命的博鬥，血淚的交流，爲了這一絲燈光。人生  晉霖　　人生像一條美麗的紆曲的小弄，兩端有着燦爛的花朶，美麗的蝴蝶，誘人的果子；我們來不及要到開口去，以爲那邊將更爲美麗。但是當我們一路前進，漸漸兒樹木枯萎了，花兒凋謝了，蝴蝶跌落了，果子不見了。當我們到達時—原來是一片荒涼的沙漠。—莎拉社會服務紅十字會擴展醫療業務　沙眼免費治療牙科取費低廉　　中國社十字會上海　分會，為擴充醫　業務，於三月份起，在新閘路一七五八號增設沙眼防治听，專爲市民　　　　及其它併症，全部免費，不收任何費用。該所器械係最新　式，由美國紅十字會撥贈，業已開始應診。又該會爲促進口腔衛生，特與中華華牙科醫學會合辦牙病診療所，由牙醫　會理事長沈稻臣鶴　及朱學靈兩醫師主持診務，取費低廉，希各界注意。江蘇省政府函復本欄　賑濟灌雲縣災民經過　希投函讀者張紹齋君注意　　査本府撥發灌雲縣匪災水災等急賑款，先後三次，共計六億五千萬元，交由灌雲縣政府依照規定施賑。又救濟麵粉三百四十噸，由前善後救濟總署賑卹廳副廳長前往査放。最近復將行總蘇寗分署移交剩餘救濟物資，及奉撥解凍救濟食糧，均配撥一部份，交由第八區專員公署統籌分配所屬各縣辦理救濟。並由本省水災急賑委員會在義賑款內撥發三億元，亦匯交第八區專員公署辦理急賑各在案。准函前由，相應復請査照為荷！此致申報社會服務欄江蘇省政府啓徵求人才　　（一）某公司微女性會計員兼英文打字員二人，（待遇優厚須大學經濟系畢業）（二）某公館微女性家庭敎師（兼助　家務）一人。（三）本市及南　其話劇　徵女性話劇演員十人。（四）浙江某校微男性生物敎員一人（須大學生物系畢業）（五）本市某機關　職員一人（性別不拘須大學心理系或敎育系畢業且有性向及職業測騐心得或工作經騐者）（六）本市某藥房徵藥劑師一人（性別不拘須大學藥科舉業）凡願應徵上列工作者請即親至本市四川北路八五六號社會部上海職業介紹所面洽（時間關係以居住本市者爲限）服務簡訊　　尋孩　茲有六歲男孩小名成福，安徽人，在金陵東路走失，如有仁人君子送其至三脾樓汽軍行，當有重酬，決不食言。　　徵求書籍　本報讀者梁國鈞君，徽購「在甘地先生左右」一書，（係會聖提著），如讀者有此書而願割愛或知其出售處者，請賜函上海（11）河南中路五一五號梁君爲辛！　　出讓書籍　本報讀者諸君，早歲東　攻　電機工程，近因母喪負債甚鉅，願以十餘年來所積之日文電機書籍八十餘册　讓償債，有意者請函上海武進　五二一七號路聞通訊社魏君接洽。　　徵「歲寒圖」　本報讀者王端君，徵求陳白　著「歲寒圖」（羣益版）一二册，願出代價十五萬元。通訊處。上海東名　九五九號上海公共汽車公司車務組。　　支票招領　本報讀者薛光圻君在天津路拾得支票一紙，計國幣五千餘萬元，遺失者請即駕臨漢口路四二二號證券大樓三樓一二八室，向上海交易所監理員辦公處薛君領回。</p>

<h3>The Legislative Yuan's 350th Regular Meeting Passes the Presidential Office Organization Act and Revises the Emergency Crime Punishment Act</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 25th] The Legislative Yuan held its 350th regular meeting on the morning of the 25th, with President Sun Ke presiding. Major cases were discussed and passed as follows: (1) The draft of the Republic of China Presidential Office Organization Act; (2) Revision of Article 8 of the Emergency Crime Punishment Act during the Suppression of Rebellion Period (The revised article is as follows: "Article 8: Those who commit crimes under this Act, except for military personnel who shall be tried by military law, non-military personnel shall be tried by a special criminal court. The organization of the special criminal court in the preceding paragraph shall be determined separately."); (3) Regulations on the Organization of Special Criminal Courts (text published on page two); (4) Regulations on Trials in Special Criminal Courts (text published on page two). There are many other routine cases, which will be discussed at the Yuan's meeting next Tuesday.</p>
<p>Today's Legislative Yuan regular meeting began at 9:30 AM. First, Deputy Secretary-General Lou Tongsun read the minutes of the previous meeting. Then, Chairman Sun Ke announced a change in the agenda, advancing the discussion of the Presidential Office Organization Act draft. Liu Kebei, Chairman of the Legislative Committee, reported on the committee's special task force review of the draft, stating that the important revisions resulting from the review were roughly as follows: (1) The originally proposed General Office in the draft was deemed unnecessary and abolished; (2) Maintaining the principle of centralization, one Secretary-General is to be appointed to oversee all affairs of the Presidential Office; (3) Under the Secretary-General, there are to be six bureaus. The originally proposed Civil Affairs and Military Affairs Departments in the draft were abolished. There will be no Chief Civil Administrator. Instead, a Chief and Deputy Chief Military Counselor will handle military affairs; (4) Senior government advisors and advisors are renamed "State Advisors," emphasizing their high merit and prestige, distinguishing them from members of the National Policy and Strategic Advisory Committee. After Mr. Liu's report, the members began discussing the articles in order. Mr. Xia Taosheng advocated abolishing the Chief Military Counselor. President Sun Ke believed that since the President is the Commander-in-Chief of the nation's army, navy, and air force, and commands all national defense forces, there should be officials like a private Chief of Staff to assist him, such as the current White House Chief of Staff, Major General Lee Hai in the United States. The Chief Military Counselor should be retained. As for the Deputy Chief Military Counselor, it was decided by Chen Changheng's student, Zhang, not to establish such a position. In addition, the National History Museum and the National Father's Mausoleum Management Committee were also added as being subordinate to the Presidential Office. The issue of the Vice President was temporarily reserved. The full text of the amended and passed Republic of China Presidential Office Organization Act is recorded below:</p>
<h3>Full Text of the Presidential Office Organization Act</h3>
<p>Article 1: The President establishes the Presidential Office to exercise powers according to the Constitution.</p>
<p>Article 2: The Presidential Office shall have a number of State Advisors, appointed by the President from those with high merit and prestige, who may provide opinions to the President on major national policies and be available for consultation.</p>
<p>Article 3: The Presidential Office shall have one Secretary-General, specially appointed, who, under the President's orders, shall oversee all affairs of the Presidential Office and direct and supervise all subordinate personnel within the Office.

<h3>Reports of Sino-French Trade Agreement Are Inaccurate</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 25th] Ministry of Foreign Affairs News: Since the signing of the new Sino-French Treaty in February 1935, the Ministry has held preliminary discussions with Mr. Mou, the former head of the French economic delegation, on the matter of negotiating a Sino-French commercial agreement. On February 18, 1936, a meeting was convened with relevant agencies to discuss the matter. It was generally agreed that France's desire to barter goods with us, under the current circumstances, could be achieved by both sides negotiating the free exchange of goods of equal value and mutual need at any time, without the need to separately establish an agreement. The Ministry conveyed this opinion to the French Embassy in March of last year. Reports that China and France have signed a commercial agreement are untrue and likely a misunderstanding in the rumors. As for the exchange of goods between China and Vietnam, it will still be handled according to the above-mentioned principles, depending on actual needs.</p>
<h3>The Ministry of Finance Explains That the Northeast Has Enough Currency for Supply</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 25th] Reports say that the number of Northeast circulating notes issued may reach more than 50 billion, but there is a severe shortage of currency in Shenyang, Changchun, Jilin, and other places, resulting in the use of promissory notes. There is a huge difference between the cash held by various banks and the required expenditures. "Where did the circulating notes go?" There is a lot of concern outside. According to the Ministry of Finance news: The work of suppressing the rebellion in the nine provinces of the Northeast is underway, and military expenses are huge. Occasional shortages in the national bank's reserves are inevitable, resulting in a shortage of currency. However, supplies are now being transported continuously and are sufficient. As for the area in which the Northeast circulating notes are used, it was originally limited to the nine provinces of the Northeast. Due to military relations, they sometimes flow into the Pingjin area, but circulation is not allowed in Pingjin, and there is no impact on Guannei [areas south of the Great Wall].</p>

From the perspective of an individual, a party member, a citizen, and a responsible politician, I will not shirk this responsibility. (2) China is an important part of the world, and China's problems are one of the world's most important problems. The world needs to establish peace, and so does China.

<p>[Our Nantong Correspondent, 25th] The Communist bandits fleeing south in northern Jiangsu have slowed down after the National Army's continuous sweeps, and a certain elite force has been added to the defense, and the situation has slowed. The First Pacification Zone, in order to completely eliminate the bandits north of the Yangtze River and smash the bandit army's attempt to flee south across the river, has recently made new deployments, which are officially announced today.

<h3>Prelude to the National Assembly: Vice Presidential Election Heats Up</h3>
<p>The first National Assembly is about to open, marking the beginning of democratic politics. A new page is being turned in the history of the ancient Republic of China. People greet it with mixed feelings of joy and worry. We are happy that in this generation, we have finally stepped into the realm of democratic politics. We are worried, however, about this troubled country! While it may not be considered a miracle, it tells us that this is no ordinary event. A nation that has endured eight years of war against the enemy, followed by more than two years of continuous internal strife, amidst political, economic, and military turmoil, has managed to overcome all difficulties and advance the establishment of a democratic constitutional government. Today, the Constitution of the Republic of China has been in effect for three months, and we are convening the first National Assembly, exercising the rights we deserve and should enjoy as citizens of the Republic of China.</p>
<p>The powers of the National Assembly are to elect and recall the President and Vice President, and to amend the Constitution. However, this National Assembly is being held only three months after the implementation of the Constitution. The Constitution has just been implemented, so it is not possible to amend it immediately. Therefore, the main purpose of this National Assembly is clearly to elect the President and Vice President.</p>
<p>According to the Constitution, the President is the head of state, representing the Republic of China externally and commanding the national army, navy, and air force internally. The President has various decision-making powers, although some matters require the consent of relevant parties. However, the Vice President, whose position is second only to the President, has no specific provisions in the Constitution. All we can understand is that "the Vice President has no power when the President exercises his functions." According to Article 49 of the Constitution, the Vice President can only succeed or act on behalf of the President when the President is absent or unable to perform his duties. Therefore, the Vice President holds a prominent position, second only to the President, but his actual power is less than that of a department head. However, on the eve of the opening of the National Assembly, the feverish race for the Vice Presidency has already begun in the capital. Why is no one running for President? Just like the elections for National Assembly representatives, or for members of the Legislative Yuan and Control Yuan, people only run for official positions and not for alternates. What is the reason for this? The ratio of official representatives to alternate representatives is no different from that of President to Vice President, because when an official representative is absent, the alternate representative will fill the position. Conversely, if the official representative is never absent, then the alternate representative will never be able to fill the position. This is the same as the Vice President having no power when the President is in office. However, on the eve of this election, those who intend to serve the country and the people have only chosen this empty position as their goal. This clearly shows the unanimous support of the entire nation for the current Chairman Chiang. They have hardly considered the need for anyone other than Chairman Chiang as the first President. The reporter once inquired about this issue to those who had already stated that they would be presidential candidates, and also sought the opinions of senior members of the Democratic Socialist Party and the Youth Party on the issue of presidential candidates. I can say that there was not a single different answer from people inside and outside the parties, and from all walks of life: "The President is naturally Chairman Chiang!" This includes many factors: Chairman Chiang is the leader who led the successful Northern Expedition, Chairman Chiang is the leader who led the War of Resistance and achieved victory, Chairman Chiang is the leader who led the people from military government to tutelage, and then to constitutional government. Chairman Chiang led the revolution, and he is the leader of democratic politics. Chairman Chiang is the most contributing leader in Chinese history. At the beginning of this constitutional government, it is natural not to abandon the founding mentor. This is one of the reasons.</p>
<p>At the same time, some people say, if we don't choose Chairman Chiang, who should we choose? Suppose we let the advanced members of the Democratic Socialist Party and the Youth Party be elected! But hardly anyone has thought, "Is there such a person in the other two parties whose talent and experience are higher than Chairman Chiang and who is more capable of this arduous task?" As for the Kuomintang itself, almost everyone handles their work under the influence of Chairman Chiang. They believe that listening to Chairman Chiang's instructions is the most unchangeable truth in the world. They believe and trust Chairman Chiang with one heart and one mind. They have not considered anyone other than Chairman Chiang. So who will be elected President? No one has considered it: "Of course, it's Chairman Chiang!" This contains respect and also implies a sense of rewarding merit. Because without the wise leadership of Chairman Chiang, how could we have the opportunity to hold the National Assembly and run for and be elected Vice President today!</p>
<p>Therefore, in the prelude to the election, the issue of presidential candidates has become a non-issue. Next is the vice presidential election. The first thing that can be reported here is that some hopeful candidates with enthusiasm for the election, when they have considered participating in the election, immediately have the idea "Shouldn't we listen to Chairman Chiang's instructions?" Almost regardless of whether they are within the party or not, this idea is based on trust and respect for the leader. However, this is just their idea. Chairman Chiang has not commented on "democracy." He is not prepared to control "democracy." He gives the greatest freedom to those who are about to participate in the election. Therefore, after this atmosphere spread, the vice presidential election campaign began.</p>
<p>The selection, identity, and nomination of vice presidential candidates are developing latently, like an undercurrent. There are different theories on whether the vice president should hold concurrent posts. It seems that some further discussion is necessary, but they resolutely launched their election campaigns in different ways. Up to today, the capital has been filled with a strong campaign atmosphere. Tea parties for the vice presidential candidates are taking place one after another. This battle seems to be quite heated. The reporter wants to say that there are currently five candidates in Nanjing. In terms of the division of civilian and military backgrounds, there are Yu Youren, Sun Ke, and Mo Dehui for the civilians, and Li Zongren and Cheng Qian for the military. In terms of party affiliation, only Mo Dehui is participating as a social leader. In terms of native place, Yu and Mo are from the north, and the rest are from the south. However, they each have their own strengths and confidence. They have started this first lesson in democracy based on the support of others or on their own initiative.</p>

<h3>Cultivating Talents and Employing Talents</h3>
<p>— Zhu Guangqian</p>
<p>According to recent statistics, there are about 121,400 students in middle schools and above across the country who receive full public funding, and about 24,900 who receive half public funding, totaling about 145,000. Public funding increases with commodity prices, and the annual amount of funds required is difficult to estimate. Moreover, the number of people receiving public funding also changes at any time, with a tendency to increase rather than decrease. According to the situation in the most recent month, the highest full public funding per person has reached about 3 million yuan. Taking schools as a unit, the public funding item sometimes exceeds the total salaries and allowances of all teachers and staff, exceeding routine expenses and equipment expenses by more than ten or even dozens of times. Taking the national education funding as a unit, the estimated total public funding for the 36th year of the Republic (1947) was 50.4 billion, accounting for about 15% of the total education funding; the budgeted total public funding for the 37th year of the Republic (1948) is about 730 billion, accounting for about 25% of the total education funding. According to the Ministry of Education's instruction on March 14, "the current monthly expenditure for student public discussion fees will reach 100 billion yuan," which is much higher than the budget. This cannot be said to be a large expense.</p>
<p>The establishment of public funding began in the early years of the War of Resistance Against Japan. At that time, many schools were facing destruction, and students were either away from their hometowns and their sources of income were cut off, or although their homes were close to the school, they still had no ability to pay for their own education due to the impact of the war. In order to help displaced and poor youths, and to maintain education during the war, the government established public funding. In the extremely difficult economic conditions of the war, the government was actually able to make such long-term calculations. Its painstaking efforts are admirable. At that time, in addition to cultivating talents, there was another purpose, which was not to allow the next generation of Chinese masters to stay in the occupied areas and be ravaged or used by the enemy and puppets. Therefore, the establishment of public funding has both educational and political meanings. On the one hand, it is education, and on the other hand, it is cultivation. Judging from the results of the nine years of the War of Resistance Against Japan, the effectiveness of both aspects is quite considerable: we have cultivated some useful talents and also rescued many youths who might have fallen into enemy-occupied areas.</p>
<p>After the victory of the War of Resistance Against Japan, the economic situation of ordinary families was worse than before, and the public funding system had to be maintained. However, the number of students increased day by day, and the government also felt that the burden was becoming heavier day by day. Therefore, starting from the new students last year, public funding was changed to scholarships, and the number of scholarships was limited to only 20% of the total number of new students. However, as far as the current situation is concerned, those who have already received public funding continue to receive it as before. In addition to scholarships, there are also disaster relief funds for communist areas, public funding for demobilized youth soldiers, and grants for the children of war heroes. Therefore, in fact, most students still rely on national support. The purpose of this support is still the same as during the War of Resistance Against Japan, with both educational cultivation and political acceptance.</p>
<p>Judging from the situation in the one or two years after the restoration, the impact of the public funding system on the youth at school can be said to be both good and bad. The good is undeniable. The lifeline of education depends on it, and some outstanding and poor children do rely on it to achieve something in their studies. The bad is also unavoidable. Wealthy children occupy the places of poor children, waste public funds, and cunning and unscrupulous people receive double public funds from different schools or fraudulently receive public funds. Some people occupy public funding and regard schools as hotels or sanatoriums. The most common phenomenon is that they regard public funding as something they deserve, and few people remember that this is the price of the blood and sweat of ordinary people who are poorer than themselves. They still complain every day, without thinking that ordinary people are even more miserable than they are. Even their teachers are not as well off as they are in terms of special treatment. For example, taking Beiping as an example, a professor with a family of four or five can only receive at most 10 million, which is slightly more than that, while a full public funding recipient receives more than 3 million. The children of professors have to pay tuition to enter school.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, the opinions of most people in the education community are consistent. Under the current social and economic conditions, outstanding and poor children still have to rely on the power of the state to cultivate them, and the public funding or scholarship system must be maintained. However, the method must be improved. The state's cultivation should be limited to outstanding and poor students. We should not waste the people's hard-earned money indiscriminately and without a plan to subsidize naughty and profligate people. The current method gives the impression that it is more about cultivation than education, and even the cultivation does not achieve the government's purpose of cultivation. To put it bluntly, the purpose of cultivation is to prevent young students from rebelling. If they are raised but not educated, the recipients will inevitably rebel.</p>
<p>But the most serious problem is not this, but that raising cannot raise them for a lifetime. Students will eventually graduate and leave school. As far as the current actual situation is concerned, graduation is equivalent to unemployment, which is equivalent to cutting off support. This group of young students has received a very high level of education and has very high ideals. As soon as they leave school, you tell them that they have no use for what they have learned. Their ideals are shattered. Can you expect them to stand obediently on the hunger line forever? Therefore, I thought of Su Dongpo's article on "Warring States Knights." He said that the custom of raising talents was very popular in the Warring States period, "Those who worked hard to serve the superiors were all clumsy and incompetent. Even if they wanted to rebel, they would be the first to do so." Therefore, the six countries did not perish quickly, and Qin perished quickly because "the outstanding people were scattered and returned to the fields." He raised such a question:</p>
<p>"Where do those who ate at the hands of the Four Lords and Lu Buwei and others (Note: those who received support) all go (Note: after the support is cut off)? I don't know if they can cough and sigh and die in coarse clothes (Note: die in poverty)? Or will they sigh and use the people's time (Note: like Chen Sheng and Wu Guang rebelling)!"</p>
<p>This topic still has its importance now and is worth thinking about for those who talk about governance and power.</p>
<p>Even if we put aside political power struggles, we also have to ask: we spend so much material and human resources to cultivate so many students. There must be a purpose. What is the purpose of raising them but not using them? Unemployment and cutting off support are not only a major disaster for the youth themselves, but also a major loss for the country and society. Needless to say, this youth unemployment problem must be solved as soon as possible. We would like to offer three suggestions on this:</p>
<p>First, the reason for unemployment is that the government has no plan for the future of school graduates. Education should adapt to the needs of the current environment and prepare what kind of bricks and tiles to build what kind of houses. We should consider what kind of undertakings the country has to do now, how many talents are needed, and then train the talents needed for those undertakings step by step. Only by measuring output based on input can we achieve the two major principles of "everyone has something to do" and "people have something to do." At present, we are just copying personnel matters, setting up universities indiscriminately, and producing a large number of students who are not very suitable, sending them out of school, and considering that they have delivered the goods and unloaded the responsibility. This is aimless education. How can aimless education be effective?</p>
<p>Second, many young people are unemployed not because of an oversupply of talent, but because of the stagnation of all industries. For example, in medicine, if the country wants to modernize and rationalize medical and health facilities, the number of medical personnel that can be used is still far from the actual needs. Because the country has not started to develop medical and health facilities at all, it is calling people who study medicine to have nothing to do in China, where doctors are most lacking. This contradictory phenomenon is the same in every public undertaking. There is a shortage of engineers, but engineers have nothing to do. There is a shortage of teachers, but teachers have nothing to do. The solution is of course the development of public undertakings. Due to the continuation of the war, there are certainly many difficulties in developing public undertakings, but it is not absolutely impossible. Schools can be maintained, so why can't other institutions be maintained? It is not entirely a matter of funding. The most important thing is planning, organization, and driving force. If you are at a loss, things will naturally stop, and people will naturally be idle.</p>
<p>Third, many young people are unemployed, partly because there is no reasonable method for the appointment and elimination of civil servants. Government agencies are as numerous as hairs, and redundant personnel in agencies are as numerous as hairs. The positions where things can be done are occupied by some incompetent people, so young and talented people have no way to intervene. A reasonable method is to strictly implement a performance appraisal system within the agency, and those who should be laid off should be laid off; strictly implement an examination system outside the agency, and those who can fill vacancies should fill them. Doing so can not only eradicate malpractices such as sneaking in through connections and relying on power, but also solve part of the unemployment problem, and also improve administrative efficiency and encourage the efforts and progress of ordinary citizens.</p>
<p>In the blink of an eye, it will be the summer vacation, and another large group of graduates will be leaving school to find work. The unemployment problem will become more serious day by day. We hope that the political and educational authorities can understand the seriousness of this problem and come up with a solution as soon as possible.</p>

<h3>Director Zhang Reports on the Current Economic Situation. The Powers of the Price Stabilization Committee are Partially Strengthened. Import of Nineteen Kinds of Chemical Products is Prohibited. One Hundred Million US Dollars is Enough to Recover All Legal Tender.</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 25th] The Full Economic Council held its regular meeting on the afternoon of the 25th. Chairman Zhang Qun first gave a detailed report on the general economic situation, particularly emphasizing that under the current circumstances, it is not appropriate to change the foreign exchange policy rashly. If any of the committee members have any opinions, they can directly suggest them to me, and I will adopt feasible ones for implementation. Director Zhang also analyzed the possibility of US aid, saying that it could be decided after the US Congress passes it in early June. Although the numbers passed by the Senate Foreign Affairs Committee and the House of Representatives are different, I believe that this time we should not be disappointed. After the success of US aid, it should still be used in conjunction with the ten self-help plans I have drafted. Regarding stabilizing the value of legal tender and enhancing its credibility, the Executive Yuan is currently studying specific measures based on the resolution of the State Council. Zhang also mentioned the issue of whether or not to publish the number of legal tender issued, and pointed out that the number issued is not as large as rumored outside. As long as there is 100 million US dollars, all legal tender can be recovered. The success of US aid should have a good impact on prices. Prices are already trending downward. What is currently concerning is the problem of workers' cost of living index, which is increasing monthly. Factories already feel unable to bear it. The problem is quite serious. I hope that labor and management can understand and understand each other and seek a reasonable solution. I also hope that all committee members will study more and provide good opinions. The powers of the Full Economic Council are not strong enough. Whether from a theoretical or practical point of view, all economic institutions, such as the Fuel Control Committee, the Textile Adjustment Committee, and the Post-War Rehabilitation Committee, should all be subordinate to the Full Economic Council before the government's economic policies can be smoothly implemented. The powers of the Full Economic Council must be strengthened in the future. Zhang's report lasted half an hour. Then, Gu Yuzhu, Deputy Secretary-General of the Council, reported on the recent reasons for the decline in prices. Then, Committee Member Shi Kuiling reported on the economic situation in North China and made recommendations, which Director Zhang instructed to be submitted to relevant agencies for research. Finally, the committee members discussed three proposals, which are recorded separately as follows: (1) Proposal to stabilize prices: Because prices are currently trending downward, no specific discussion was held on the price stabilization measures proposed in the past. We will wait and see the trend of prices, and only put forward the calculation formula for the price increase of eleven kinds of daily necessities proposed by the Secretariat for discussion, and decided to implement it first for five kinds of daily necessities: coal, rice, wheat, silk, and cotton cloth. The above-mentioned calculation formula for the price increase of the five kinds of daily necessities will be submitted to relevant agencies for detailed research, and then submitted to the meeting for discussion. (2) Proposal on how to strengthen the powers of the Price Stabilization Committee: After the Secretariat convenes a small group of committees for review, it will be submitted to the meeting for discussion again, and Wang Yunwu, Chen Qitian, Weng Wenhao, Yu Hongjun, Yu Feipeng and others will be appointed to organize a small group meeting for review. (3) Proposal on the import of two chemical products in Annex 2 of the import trade for the fifth and sixth quarters: passed according to the review opinions. Chemical products that can be manufactured domestically are prohibited from import, and those whose domestic production quantity is not enough are restricted from import, so as to save foreign exchange. Nineteen of the forty-seven chemical products are not allowed to be imported, and nine are allowed to be partially imported. In the seventh quarter, these nine will also not be allowed to be imported. Imported chemical products will be distributed to factories as much as possible and to importers as little as possible.</p>
<p>Shi Kuiling Reports on the Economy of North China</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 25th] Shi Kuiling, Director of the Tianjin Financial Administration and Committee Member of the Full Economic Council, presented a report on the economic investigation of North China Pingjin at the Full Economic Council on the 25th. In addition to the written report, Shi also gave an oral report. Its content is divided into four parts: transportation, industry and mining, finance, and import and export trade. He pointed out that the reasons for the economic depression in the north are: A. Difficult environment, B. Difficult transportation, C. Shrinking production, D. Financial exhaustion. Therefore, in the future, special attention should be paid to increasing production of materials, restoring transportation, and stabilizing prices.</p>
<h3>Joint Board of Directors</h3>
<p>Industrial and Mining Loans for National Policy Portion Approved for 193 Billion</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 25th] The industrial and mining loan plan proposed by the Resources Committee, totaling 472 billion yuan, divided into national policy loans, business loans, and order loans, was approved by the Joint Board of Directors on the 25th. The national policy portion of the loan is 193 billion yuan, and the remaining portion will be handled according to the circumstances.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 25th] The land development company to be established by the China Farmers Bank, the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, and the Ministry of Land Affairs, in accordance with Chairman Chiang's instructions, had its funding loan of 50 billion yuan approved by the Joint Board of Directors on the 25th. In the past, Chairman Chiang had a hand-written order saying "All barren mountains, forests, public fields, and public lands nationwide should be handed over to the China Farmers Bank for speedy development and use." The China Farmers Bank then formulated a plan to establish a company based on this order. After review by a small group meeting of relevant agencies, it was submitted to the China Farmers Bank, the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, and the Ministry of Land Affairs for preparation.</p>
<p>When the Joint Board of Directors held its regular meeting on the 25th, it also passed (1) The Tanggu New Port project fee loan of 60 billion yuan expired at the end of March. After review, it was decided to extend it for three months and increase the loan by 30 billion yuan. (2) The Longhai Railway loan of 10 billion yuan expired at the end of March and was approved for a three-month extension. Other railway loans are still under study. The issue of dividing silk loans was discussed for a long time at the meeting. Some argued that it should belong to national policy loans, while others argued that it should be stricter than business loans. It was decided that relevant agencies would hold a small group meeting in Shanghai on the 27th for discussion, and submit it to the next board meeting for discussion.</p>
<h3>Sun Ke Answers Reporters' Questions</h3>
<p>(Continued from page 1) After Sun's report, he answered questions from reporters separately. Regarding foreign policy, Sun said: China is an independent country, and its foreign policy is an independent policy. From the standpoint of the country, all countries that are friendly to us and can abide by treaties and maintain our complete territorial sovereignty are our friends; otherwise, they should be treated differently. Someone asked for his opinion on civilian rule and military rule. Sun replied: In peacetime, it is always civilian rule, and military rule is a situation in extraordinary times. Regarding whether Sun would continue to concurrently serve as the Speaker of the Legislative Yuan if he were elected, Sun replied: The fact has not yet occurred. The Constitution does not stipulate that the Vice President cannot concurrently serve as the Speaker of the Legislative Yuan. The Constitution only stipulates that members of the Legislative Yuan cannot concurrently serve as officials. It seems that all those elected by the people are not officials, such as the President, Vice President, members of the Legislative Yuan and Control Yuan, the Speaker of the Legislative Yuan, and the President of the Police Academy are not officials. Regarding the issue of Sun's nomination for election, Sun replied that if party nomination is adopted, then the Kuomintang should first decide on a candidate. If I am the candidate, then there is no problem. If the party decides on someone other than me, then I will abide by the party's order and no longer nominate myself for election. Conversely, if the party does not intend to nominate a candidate, then I can nominate myself to participate in the election freely. At this point, someone asked whether Sun was canvassing votes from the Democratic Socialist Party and the Youth Party. He replied that if the Democratic Socialist Party and the Youth Party each nominate candidates, then we should not canvass votes from those parties. If neither party nominates a candidate, then I would naturally welcome their votes to elect me. Regarding election expenses, Sun said: In order to respect the sacred vote of the National Assembly representatives, I will not use a single cent. Someone speculated that if Sun were elected and the President was unable to perform his duties due to an incident, and he were to act on behalf of the President, could the position of Speaker of the Legislative Yuan be held concurrently? He replied that if he were acting on behalf of the President, he could no longer return to the Legislative Yuan, and the Deputy Speaker of the Legislative Yuan could act on his behalf, or he could be re-elected. Someone asked why he did not run for President. Sun replied that we support Chairman Chiang in running for President. As an official, I should support the leader of the party.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 25th] Regarding whether the National Assembly session will be extended due to the failure to resolve some disputes and the insufficient number of registered representatives, someone raised a question at Sun Ke's press conference on the 25th. Sun replied that it would depend on whether the number of registered representatives on the eve of the opening of the National Assembly meets the legal quorum. The Preparatory Committee of the National Assembly has no right to decide on an extension.</p>

<h3>Election of National Representatives Involves Litigation; Zhang Lisheng and Others Accused; Beijing High Court to Hold Hearing Tomorrow</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 25th Dispatch] National professional women's organizations jointly nominated Fu Xiaofeng and Qiu Yingguang, who were elected as National Representatives. Considering they received the most votes, they should legally be elected. However, the election office for national professional women's organizations, based on "party membership priority methods," announced them as alternates. Claiming that this announcement was made under the orders of the General Election Office, they filed a lawsuit with the Capital High Court, naming Wei Qiongying and Li Baoping, nominated by political parties but elected as alternates, as the first defendants, and Zhang Lisheng, Chairman of the General Election Office, as the second defendant. The court has scheduled a hearing for the 27th of this month.</p>
<h3>Jin Bihui Executed by Firing Squad</h3>
<p>(Continued from Page 1) Jin Bihui, a notorious international female spy, was a mysterious figure in life, and her death also contained a strong sense of mystery. The execution was carried out in absolute secrecy. With the exception of one reporter from an American magazine, all Chinese reporters were barred from the entrance. Therefore, the truth of the execution is unclear. Later, a female corpse was left at the back door of the First Prison on Ziqiang Road, purportedly the body of Jin Bihui.</p>
<p>Face Covered in Blood</p>
<p>Prison officials guided reporters to view the body at 7:30 this morning. The body lay with its head to the south and feet to the north, dressed in a gray prison uniform, with blue wool pants and a red wool sweater underneath. The bullet entered from the back of the head and exited through the bridge of the nose. The hair was disheveled, and the face was covered in blood, making it impossible to identify. Jin Bihui's crimes were serious, and she was the first major traitor to be executed in Pingjin. Therefore, the Hebei High Court Prosecutor's Office attached great importance to this matter. At 5:00 AM on the 25th, they notified various newspapers and news agencies, inviting reporters to the scene to report on the circumstances of the execution to the public. In addition, the China Electric Third Factory was invited to the scene to film the event. Reporters from various newspapers arrived in advance, but unexpectedly were suddenly refused entry. The guards threw out all the reporters' business cards from a small door, claiming: "The Warden does not allow entry." Afterwards, reporters from various newspapers, due to the strange turn of events, have jointly filed a serious protest with the High Court Prosecutor's Office and the prison through the Journalists Association for External Affairs of Industry and Commerce.</p>
<p>Two Letters</p>
<p>[Our Beiping Office, 25th Dispatch] The Hebei High Court Prosecutor's Office announced that Jin Bihui had written two letters before her execution: (1) To Father (referring to her adoptive father, the Japanese Naniwa Kawashima): I was finally executed on the morning of March 25th. Please tell the young people to pray unceasingly for the future of China, and please go to my late father's grave and tell him about China, and that I will also serve China in the next life. (2) To the Warden, Section Chief, Guard Zhao, and Mr. Cai: Thank you for your kindness during my life. I really didn't expect to die without changing my clothes. My family's feelings towards me are like this; there's no need to say anything else. Jin Bihui.</p>

<h3>US Military Leaders Propose Plan to Expand Forces and Strengthen National Defense; Requesting Military Spending Increase to $24 Billion</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] New York, 25th Broadcast: Washington Dispatch, Today, US military leaders urged Congress to immediately expand the armed forces and conscript young people aged 19 to 25. Secretary of Defense Forrestal stated that the current situation is still favorable to peace and the free nations of the world, but he urged Congress to immediately approve the following: (1) Increase the currently authorized strength of the Army, Navy, and Air Force by 349,500 personnel; (2) Allocate an additional $3 billion to meet the needs of this military expansion effort, given that the current budget for national defense is $11 billion; (3) Conscript young people aged 19 to 25, which would provide 1,355,000 people, but only 220,000 may be needed; (4) Establish a permanent system of universal military training, to be completed within three years, which would produce approximately 850,000 people annually with basic military training. As for other details, Forrestal believes that due to "the world situation," a report must be submitted in a closed session. Forrestal vigorously emphasized the urgency of strengthening national defense to deter the Soviet Union. Of the troop increases he proposed, the Army would receive 240,000 personnel, the Navy 63,000, the Marine Corps 11,000, and the Air Force 35,500. The current actual strength of the US military is 1,392,000, while the authorized maximum strength is 1,732,000. Of the requested increase in military spending, he proposed $775 million for the Air Force and aircraft manufacturing and research, approximately $76 million for military personnel, and the remainder to cover miscellaneous expenses.</p>
<p>[Our Dispatch] New York, 25th Broadcast: Washington Dispatch, A senior Treasury Department official stated today that if tax revenues are not reduced, then increasing spending by $20-30 billion for military preparations will not have a major impact on the US economy. However, he also said that if spending is three or four times greater than this figure, then it will be necessary to restore controls, perhaps even greater in scope than wartime controls, to prevent inflation. In addition, tax rates must also be increased. In other words, in addition to the rationing, price controls, and other controls implemented during World War II, it will also be necessary to forcibly conscript workers for essential jobs. He said that the government's plan to prepare militarily to prevent Soviet expansion is still under study.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 24th Dispatch] The US Air Force Department announced today that it will continue to recruit 25,000 new soldiers. A week ago, the department announced that the Air Force strength had reached 312,000 and that it did not intend to continue recruiting. Today, it suddenly changed its plan to recruit 337,000 soldiers, and the ban on married soldiers enlisting has also been lifted. It is rumored that the Air Force Department will ask Congress to approve the expansion of the Air Force to 450,000 or 500,000 officers and soldiers. In other words, the current 55 squadrons must be expanded to 70 squadrons. A bill was introduced in the House of Representatives today advocating that the Air Force establish 70 combat squadrons, 22 special squadrons, and 27 National Defense Air Force squadrons and at least 34 Air Force Reserve squadrons.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, San Francisco, 25th Dispatch] Rear Admiral Noble, Chief of the Bureau of Ordnance, stated today that since the end of World War II, US naval ordnance has constantly been innovating and is now unparalleled in the world. The accuracy of warships' anti-aircraft guns hitting enemy aircraft has increased by more than 50% compared to the end of the war, and they can respond to orders in the event of an emergency.</p>
<h3>US Supplies Continuously Shipped to the Soviet Union; Congressional Members Express Outrage; Truman Issues Statement Explaining</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] New York, 25th Broadcast: Washington Dispatch, Congress is extremely outraged by the shipment of US supplies to the Soviet Union. Today, President Truman said at a press conference that the Soviet Union is currently a friendly country, and most of the cargo being shipped is from contracts signed two years ago.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 24th Dispatch] Peter Petersen, Director of the Munitions Division of the Department of State, stated that President Truman will issue a statement soon, severely restricting the shipment of aircraft parts and other important war materials to the Soviet Union and its satellite countries.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 25th Dispatch] The shipment of American aircraft engines and other materials to the Soviet Union amid the tense global situation is causing great public outrage in Congress. House Investigating Committee Chairman Rizley stated that the following three actions will now be taken: (1) Request the Department of Commerce to completely stop shipping US materials to the Soviet Union and its vassal states. (2) Immediately investigate whether cargo boxes destined for the Soviet Union are piled up at the New York docks. (3) Thoroughly investigate the situation of the Moore-McCormack Lines shipping company in New York, which is transporting materials for the Soviet purchasing agency.</p>
<p>Committee investigators have gone to the shipping company to examine the books and will investigate the loading of cargo in New York Harbor by 60 ships flying the Soviet flag since January 1.</p>
<p>Anderson, Deputy Director of the Office of International Resources of the Department of State, testified before the House Investigating Committee yesterday that the Department of State has not yet formulated a shipping policy that distinguishes between friendly and unfriendly countries. The committee members were greatly shocked to hear this. Rizley also stated that Surplus Property Administrator Larsen had reported to him that yesterday he received an order to freeze all surplus aircraft, aircraft equipment, and parts within the United States and prohibit their export. However, other officials of the bureau said that they were unaware of this order. Rizley then explained to reporters that perhaps the Army and Navy authorities now want to retain the surplus aircraft to see how the world situation changes. "However, it is too ridiculous to supply Uncle Stalin with military materials at a time when we need them so much." New York Congressman Celler also shared this sentiment. It is said that it is heartbreaking to see materials related to our survival being shipped to the Soviet Union.</p>
<h3>Proposals for Universal Military Training: Mrs. Roosevelt Endorses, Einstein Opposes</h3>
<p>[U.S. News Bureau, Washington, 24th Dispatch] Mrs. Roosevelt and Einstein have expressed differing opinions regarding the proposal for universal military training submitted to the Senate Military Affairs Committee today. As the Military Affairs Committee continued its public hearing on the issue of universal military training, a letter from workers was read aloud and included in the record. Mrs. Roosevelt stated in her letter that she had previously opposed universal military training, and said, "But at present, I no longer oppose universal military training, because I believe this stance is sufficient to make the Soviet Union understand our goal of maintaining strength, until the United Nations can establish a force sufficient to control any aggression, and all countries can gradually reduce their armaments." Einstein stated in his letter that universal military training would accelerate the arms race, increase tensions between the U.S. and the Soviet Union, and thus increase the danger of war. "In my opinion, the use of compulsory military training is only necessary and reasonable in the foreseeable future if there is a threat of hostile invasion of American territory. I believe that this kind of threat does not currently exist."</p>
<p>Another witness against universal military training was Linfield, the newly appointed Veterans Advisory Committee member of the National Wallace for President Committee. He read a statement, saying that it was prepared by many other people. Dr. Kang Yuzhen, a Nobel Prize winner and nuclear physicist who helped invent the atomic bomb, strongly urged the passage of universal military training legislation.</p>
<h3>U.S. Tax Reduction Bill</h3>
<p>Passed by Both Houses, Sent to the President for Signature</p>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 24th Dispatch] The House of Representatives today passed an income tax reduction bill, which will reduce income taxes for 52 million taxpayers nationwide and exempt 7.4 million low-income people from income tax. The bill will now be submitted to President Truman for approval. It is expected that the President will veto it, and then it will be sent back to the two houses for reconsideration. If it is passed again by a two-thirds majority, it will become law.</p>
<h3>Panama Strictly Prevents Spies</h3>
<p>[United Press, Panama City, 25th Dispatch] A spokesperson for the Panamanian Ministry of Foreign Affairs recently stated that many Soviet people in China have requested passports to reside in or transit through Panama. The government is now taking strict measures to prevent Soviet spies or saboteurs from arriving at the Panama Canal. The spokesperson said that there have been no reports of sabotage or espionage activities yet, but there is concern that once this group of Soviet citizens arrives in Panama, "they will be reluctant to return home, or purchase permanent property with the help of unscrupulous agents."</p>
<h3>Italy is Willing to Negotiate Directly with Yugoslavia on the Trieste Issue, but Must Be Based on the Suggestions of the Three Powers</h3>
<p>[United Press, Rome, 25th Dispatch] The Italian Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced today that Italy is prepared to begin direct negotiations with Yugoslavia on the Trieste port "within the spirit and letter of the Western countries' suggestions." A spokesperson reiterated the Italian government's belief that maintaining peace between Italy and Yugoslavia is impossible before the Trieste issue is resolved. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced that Italy and Yugoslavia have reached an agreement that due to changes in the treaty boundaries, Yugoslavs in the Venezia Giulia region, which has been incorporated into Yugoslavia, will be exchanged with Slavs remaining in Italian territory. "The Italian government is extremely pleased with this agreement, and a joint Italian-Yugoslav communiqué will be issued in the coming days to announce the details of the agreement."</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 24th Dispatch] Foreign Secretary Bevin stated in the House of Commons today that the decision of the British, American, and French to recommend the return of Trieste to Italy was not motivated by the Italian general election. In response to a question from Labour MP Trevelyan, he pointed out that as early as the signing of the peace treaty with Italy, it was discussed that after the withdrawal of troops from the Trieste area four months after the signing of the treaty, the issue of returning Trieste to Italy would be raised again. However, the issue of return was not raised because the agreement to establish a free zone was not reached. Recently, in order to break the deadlock, Britain, the United States, and France decided to recommend the return of Trieste to Italy. Events in recent months have shown that the regulations for establishing the Trieste Free Zone cannot be implemented. The governments of the three countries believe that the only solution, from both a political and economic point of view, is to return Trieste to Italy. The three countries are not pessimistic about reaching an agreement with the Soviet Union on this matter. If an agreement can be reached, the next step will be to submit a report to the United Nations.</p>
<h3>Communist Demonstration in Trieste, Yugoslavia Closes Border</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Trieste, 24th Dispatch] A communist-organized demonstration against the return of Trieste to Italy was held here today, with more than 4,000 participants. An Italian demonstration originally planned in Gorizia to oppose the cession of the Gorizia province to Yugoslavia was canceled at the last minute.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 24th Dispatch] A dispatch from Paris states that the border between Yugoslavia and the Trieste Free Zone has been closed by the authorities.</p>
<p>[United Press, Trieste, 24th Dispatch] A British military spokesperson said today that British troops continue to be deployed to areas near the Yugoslav border in Trieste to be on alert.</p>
<h3>Wallace Criticizes U.S. Policy Toward Italy</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Paris, 25th Dispatch] U.S. third-party presidential candidate Wallace wrote an article for the left-leaning French independent newspaper "Franc-Tireur," stating that the policy the U.S. could adopt in Italy is sufficient to cause war. He said that the price paid by the U.S. Democratic and Republican groups for the Italian election broke the price paid for elections in any country in the world. Such policies by the U.S. are tantamount to rushing down the slope of intermittent warfare. President Truman has launched a period of warmongering so that he can declare a national emergency. The U.S. government is headed by those who call on peace-loving nations to resist Soviet aggression. They plan to make China a police state wearing a mask to ensure control over the world. While capitalist profits are soaring, they are attempting to prohibit union demands for wage increases, and capitalist profiteering is due to military subsidies given by the government.</p>
<h3>U.S. Studies Secret Plan to Encourage Anti-Communist Underground Work Behind the Iron Curtain, First Hinted at in Bridges' Words</h3>
<p>[Report from This Newspaper] New York, 25th Broadcast: Washington News, It is learned that Congress is currently studying the allocation of several million dollars to carry out a secret plan to encourage non-communists to conduct underground work behind the Iron Curtain, and it is rumored that several diplomatic and military officials have been assigned to be responsible for this work. This news was first hinted at in the words of Bridges, chairman of the Appropriations Committee, who said that the United States should encourage underground activities behind the Iron Curtain to shake the tyranny of the regions that have already been conquered by communism. It is said that this plan will be handled by the State Department, and the necessary funds will be provided to Secretary of State Marshall.</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 24th Dispatch] Senator Bridges, Chairman of the Appropriations Committee, suddenly launched a lightning-like attack on the U.S. government's post-war policy toward the Soviet Union, criticizing some Republicans for following the bipartisan policy. Bridges criticized the Republican and Democratic parties for adopting so-called "soap bubble diplomacy." He said that the U.S. foreign policy after the war has been wavering and unstable. He called for the immediate approval of the seventeen-point military and economic mobilization plan to deal with the threat of the Soviet Union's world "conspiracy." These seventeen points include: (1) Domestic communists in the United States must register immediately; (2) Federal government officials who are negligent in prevention should be dismissed; (3) Strengthening U.S. foreign bases, supplementing military shortages, and increasing the strength of the army, navy, and air force.</p>
<h3>Clayton Rumored to be Appointed as General Manager of the Aid to Europe Program</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 24th Dispatch] Former Assistant Secretary of State for Economic Affairs Clayton is rumored to be appointed as the general manager of the European Recovery Program with an annual salary of $20,000. Mr. Clayton was the head of the U.S. delegation to the Havana International Trade and Employment Conference, and he resigned from his position as Deputy Secretary of State due to poor health last autumn to attend the conference in Havana. The general manager of the European Recovery Program has the same rank as a cabinet member, and there are 500 staff members in Washington and 400 staff members abroad.</p>
<h3>U.S. House of Representatives Continues to Discuss Unified Foreign Aid Bill</h3>
<p>Hoover Expresses Approval of the Entire Bill</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 25th Dispatch] Former U.S. President Hoover approved of the foreign aid bill drafted by the House of Representatives, which includes economic and military aid to China. In a letter to House Speaker Martin requesting advice, Mr. Hoover said that aid to Greece, Turkey, and China are the most beneficial provisions in the House bill.</p>
<h3>U.S. Sharply Criticizes Soviet Union at Conference on Freedom of Information; General Assembly Breaks into Groups to Study How to Ensure Freedom of the Press</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Geneva, 25th Dispatch] Former Assistant Secretary of State Brandon, the U.S. representative, strongly criticized the Soviet Union at the plenary session of the International Conference on Freedom of Information today. He said that the worst conspirators in wartime acts and false guidance are those who monopolize the news media privately or by the government, and the more severe the monopoly of the news media, the more untrue the reports are. The accusations against the American press at the United Nations General Assembly session last September were clearly directed at the wrong target. The accusing finger should be pointed towards the East, not towards the free press of America. However, just four weeks ago, freedom was declared dead in Czechoslovakia, just 500 miles from Geneva. In other countries not far away, we have also seen freedom dying one after another. These events have made people all over the world who cherish human dignity, freedom of thought, and national independence feel terrified.</p>
<p>Brandon continued: This conference may not be able to reach an agreement on the entire agenda, but if it can establish some principles and clarify the relationship between freedom of the press and peace, then our work will not have been in vain.</p>
<p>[United Press, Geneva, 25th Dispatch] Brandon announced the U.S. plan at the meeting: (1) Seek an international agreement that stipulates methods for gathering and transmitting news that are not subject to arbitrary national restrictions; (2) Support all proposals that promote the right of people and news agencies in all countries to receive, publish, broadcast, and disseminate news by other means; (3) Review various suitable ways to develop the technological equipment, newspapers, radio, etc. of various countries, and expand the people's sources of news; (4) Hope that the proposed United Nations Declaration of Human Rights and Charter can strictly support freedom of speech and publication.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Geneva, 24th Dispatch] The Yugoslav delegation to the International Conference on Freedom of Information issued a statement today, requesting that anyone who controls information agencies should be held legally responsible for any defamatory lies and rumors that incite war that they release. The Yugoslav delegation pointed out that newspapers and information tools in many countries have become the monopoly of a few giants, who speak for the personal interests they represent. American capitalists, with their material capabilities, have prevented the United States from having a free press. It is learned that the British delegation will submit affirmative proposals to 56 countries to guarantee freedom of the press. Delegates to the General Assembly have formed a four-price committee to study various issues to ensure freedom of the press. It is expected that conflicts will occur in the committee between various factions with different ideas about freedom. Professor Huxley, Chairman of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization, addressed the General Assembly and urged delegates to abandon doctrines and theories and deal with practical problems. He put forward four major points: (1) Prevent news transmission tools from being monopolized by a few people; (2) Equal enjoyment of news transmission tools; (3) Sharing of technical methods of transmission tools; (4) The sense of responsibility of those who use modern transmission tools.</p>
<h3>British MPs Jointly Propose a Summit of the Three Giants to Save the International Crisis</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 24th Dispatch] Labour MP Cox, Labour leftist leader Crossman, and 16 others submitted a motion to the House of Commons today, requesting that Stalin, Truman, and Attlee, as well as Commonwealth leaders such as South African Prime Minister Smuts and Indian Governor-General Mountbatten, hold talks in order to seek an understanding with the Soviet Union. The motion expresses grief over the rapid deterioration of the international situation, and expresses support for Prime Minister Smuts' speech on Friday, advocating seeking an understanding with the Soviet Union.</p>
<h3>Chief Delegate of Venezuela Dies</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Geneva, 25th United Press] The International Conference on Freedom of Information recently announced that the chief delegate of Venezuela to the conference, Fang Bona, died of a heart attack last night. Everyone stood up in silence for one minute to express condolences.</p>
<h3>U.S. State Department Denies Rumors</h3>
<p>Denies Secret Agreement Between U.S. and France</p>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 24th Dispatch] The Secretary of State today solemnly denied the Moscow radio's claim that the United States and France had signed a secret agreement allowing the United States to use French air force bases. Moscow Radio said the agreement was signed in February.</p>
<h3>U.S. to Propose in the Security Council Holding a Truce Conference in the Holy Land, President Truman Announces to Reporters</h3>
<p>[Report from This Newspaper] New York, 25th Broadcast: Washington News, President Truman announced at a press conference today that the United States will recommend that the United Nations convene a truce conference of Arab and Jewish leaders to stop the war in Palestine. He said that U.S. Representative to the United Nations Austin Jiang will submit the proposal to the Security Council. Truman said he still supports the partition plan, but to cope with the situation after the withdrawal of British troops, he advocates temporary UN trusteeship.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 24th Dispatch] British Colonial Secretary Jones told a reporter from this agency that Britain has decided to hand over the trusteeship of Palestine on May 15, and will completely withdraw British troops stationed in Palestine by August 1 at the latest. Regardless of the outcome of the United Nations discussions, Britain will not change this decision.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Lake Success, 24th Dispatch] France and Canada stated in the Security Council today that at the current stage, the two countries cannot support the U.S. proposal to establish a trusteeship system in Palestine. French representative Barote asked the Security Council to proceed cautiously, hold a secret meeting first, listen to more detailed opinions from the U.S. representative, and then decide whether to convene a special General Assembly of the United Nations to review the original partition resolution of the General Assembly.</p>
<h3>Trade and Employment Conference Declared Closed</h3>
<p>Truman Praises Trade Charter</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Havana, 24th Dispatch] The United Nations Trade and Employment Conference officially closed today after signing the Charter of the World Trade Organization. The final resolution was written in the stipulated five languages. Kim Kian-soo, the Chinese ambassador to Belgium, signed the charter on behalf of China in the Chinese and English versions. The Council of the Interim Committee of the International Trade Organization will hold its first meeting in Geneva within the year. China is a member of the Council.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 24th Dispatch] President Truman referred to the results of the Havana International Trade Conference today, saying that the signing of the regulations of the International Commercial Organization is an important achievement in approaching construction, world prosperity, and lasting peace. He also said that this plan is sufficient to prove that many countries can rely on the United Nations to reach an agreement on international complex training issues.</p>
<h3>Berlin Four-Power Joint Command Conference Still Held as Usual, General Montgomery to Inspect British Zone in Germany</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Berlin, 24th Dispatch] The deputy commanders of the British, American, French, and Soviet forces in Berlin today reached the "best understanding" on several issues in the Joint Command (i.e., the Allied Military Government of the Berlin area) in Berlin. A French military spokesperson later said that the four powers had reached an agreement on several issues. This is the first symbol of agreement between the powers since Marshal Sokolovsky walked out of the Allied Control Council meeting. It is reported that when the Joint Command meeting adjourned for lunch, the four commanders of the British, American, French, and Soviet forces toasted each other with vodka supplied by the Soviet side. According to a British military spokesperson, the meeting progressed very normally, and the atmosphere was even slightly friendlier than usual. At the same time, according to newspapers registered with the Soviet authorities, it is expected that the control of the border between West Germany and East Germany will be tightened.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Berlin, 25th Dispatch] The Dutch military delegation to the Allied Control Commission for Germany, in the name of the heads of the delegations of the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg, issued a notice on the 25th stating that the delegations of the three countries did not participate in the discussion of German policy by the commanders of the British, American, and French forces stationed in Germany. The purpose of the Dutch, Belgian, and Luxembourg delegations attending the British, French, and American Commanders' Conference at the Lancashire House in Berlin was only to obtain information related to the interests of the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Berlin, 24th Dispatch] The British military government announced today that British Army Chief of Staff General Montgomery will inspect the British occupation zone in Germany on April 3, and is scheduled to go to Berlin on April 6.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, London, 24th Dispatch] British Foreign Secretary Bevin said to the House of Commons this afternoon that he could not definitively say to what extent the Soviet-occupied zone of Germany had been disarmed. He said that he had very little information on the matter, and he wanted to tell everyone that he was very dissatisfied with this situation.</p>
<h3>Prospects for the Italian General Election</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Rome, 25th Dispatch] Political observers here believe that if voters are very enthusiastic in the general election on April 18, then Gasperi and other moderate parties can be expected to win. However, it is difficult to predict the attitude of the ten million people in the middle class out of Italy's 46 million population. In general, Gasperi's heavy tax policy and tight monetary policy have hit the middle class quite hard. In addition, the general middle class mostly opposes church politics and is deeply dissatisfied with Gasperi's Christian Democratic Party's monopoly of power. However, on the other hand, the middle class is wary of the Communist Party in light of the Czech incident, and generally has a good impression of U.S. aid to Italy. Under these circumstances, the support of the middle class for moderate parties can be expected to be greater. On the left, at a recent meeting of Communist Party leaders and their allied parties, it was estimated that the People's Front led by the Communist Party could win about 11 million votes. There are about 27 million registered voters in Italy. If the Communist Party's estimate is fairly accurate, then the center and right-wing parties must redouble their efforts to gain a majority advantage over the Communist Party.</p>
<p>[United Press, Rome, 25th Dispatch] Italian military police launched searches for privately hidden weapons across the country today to prevent bloodshed in the April 18 election.</p>
<h3>Belgian Regent to Visit U.S. in Early April, White House to Treat as Distinguished Guest</h3>

Prime Minister Spaak and some key members of economic groups will accompany him. Prince Léopold and his entourage are scheduled to depart from Brussels on April 3 and fly to Washington, D.C. On the 6th, President Truman will formally receive Prince Léopold at the White House, and a banquet will be held that evening to welcome him.

Canadian Prime Minister King plans to host a banquet in Ottawa. Prince Léopold is scheduled to depart from Ottawa on April 17 and fly back to Brussels.</p>
<h3>U.S. Undersecretary Meets with Ashida, Aiming to Promote Japan's Industrial Reconstruction, Ashida Requests More U.S. Assistance</h3>
<p>[United Press, Tokyo, 25th Dispatch] U.S. Undersecretary of the Army Draper warned the Japanese government on the 25th that Japan must increase the production of important goods, revitalize foreign trade, and balance its budget in order to qualify for further U.S. assistance. A statement released by Allied Headquarters regarding the meeting between Draper and Ashida stated that Ashida raised the need for the United States to continue to assist Japan in the meeting in order to supplement Japan's self-reliance and become a self-sufficient country.</p>
<p>Draper then pointed out that some future aid plans, lease or loan methods may be considered by the U.S. Congress. Draper emphasized that U.S. assistance cannot continue indefinitely. "Assistance can only temporarily make up for shortages until Japan is able to help itself. Japan must do its best to achieve this." At the same time, John Johnston, the head of the National Chemical Bank, and Fish, the Special Advisor to the Undersecretary, also attended the meeting. This meeting particularly reviewed the situation regarding food, coal, and steel production, as this situation is the main foundation for self-sufficiency and economic turnaround. They also discussed the need to revitalize Japan's foreign trade, which is a way for Japan to obtain raw materials and supply urgently needed goods to countries in the Far East. Draper also emphasized the military importance of Japan balancing its budget, saying that this is an important condition for maintaining price and currency stability. Ashida promised to make the greatest effort to balance the budget "as soon as possible."</p>
<p>[United Press, Tokyo, 25th Dispatch] According to sources close to the Draper mission, the main purpose of the mission to Japan is to revitalize Japanese industry so that Japan can resume normal peacetime commercial relations with other countries without waiting for the conclusion of the Japanese peace treaty. This goal will be advanced within the scope of the occupation system.</p>
<p>[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 25th Dispatch] According to sources close to the U.S. Undersecretary of the Army Draper's inspection team, the opinions of the State Department and the Department of the Army differ greatly on the issue of Japan's industrial level. Draper's report after this inspection trip back to the United States may be used as the final decision plan, and it is believed that it will be largely similar to the Strike Plan. In addition, there is considerable emphasis here on the visit of U.S. Undersecretary of the Army Draper and his party to Japan to inspect industry, and they particularly expressed their "Japanese psychology." Various newspapers and people are emphasizing the meaning of "anti-communism." Recently, there have been rumors that Draper's trip has a mission to urge MacArthur to return home to run for election. If MacArthur is elected, the United States may have an anti-communist government.</p>
<p>U.S. Investigation Team Busy in Meetings in Japan</p>
<p>[United Press, Tokyo, 25th Dispatch] The people of the Draper investigation team held a two-hour meeting with General MacArthur on the 25th, and then held a long meeting with Allied officials throughout the afternoon. Sources close to the team said that the purpose of the meeting with headquarters staff was to discuss promoting Japan's economy with the help of foreign capital.</p>

<h3>Approval of the League Covenant by the Senate, Netherlands Recruits Army Reservists, Denmark Intensifies Coastal Defenses</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Brussels, 24th] The Belgian Senate has recently approved the Five-Power Treaty by a vote of 128 to 15. The 15 dissenting votes were cast by Communist senators. Prior to the vote, Senate Speaker Rollin expressed hope that the consultation committee stipulated in the Five-Power Treaty could be established as soon as possible. The House of Representatives is scheduled to discuss the treaty after Easter and is expected to pass it with a similar majority.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Brussels, 25th] The second general meeting of the representatives of the foreign ministers of the five nations (Britain, France, the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg) was convened here at 11:00 a.m. on the 25th.

<p>[Associated Press, The Hague, 24th] Officials announced today that the Dutch army will soon recruit volunteers to replenish its ranks in case of emergency. All men under the age of 55 who have undergone more than six months of military training are eligible to enlist. These new recruits will be formed into a reserve force.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Copenhagen, 24th] According to reliable sources, the Danish military authorities have ordered Danish officers who have requested leave for Easter not to leave their assigned areas. Easter holidays for officer cadets at Kronborg Castle in Elsinore have been canceled, and they are not allowed to leave the city. The castle guard has also been issued live ammunition. The Danish Foreign Affairs Committee held a meeting today, and the subsequent communiqué stated only that Danish Prime Minister Hedtoft and Foreign Minister Rasmussen had reported on their respective trips to Stockholm and Paris. A Danish government spokesperson issued a broadcast tonight, urging Danish citizens, especially coastal residents, to immediately report any suspicious or unusual activity to the authorities. The spokesperson said that the government had thoroughly investigated reports of secret arms shipments arriving on a Danish coast. While these reports have been found to be untrue, the occurrence of such events is not impossible.</p>
<h3>Record of the Corfu Channel Case Hearing</h3>
<p>— (By Our Special Correspondent in Europe, Zhongxi)</p>
<p>The Opening Remarks of the First Chamber</p>
<p>As the noise of the cameras subsided, President Guillet rose and addressed the court, stating that the International Court of Justice currently has two cases awaiting trial. One is the Corfu Channel case, which is beginning today, and the other is the case concerning the qualifications and conditions for a state to join the United Nations as a member. The latter case will open on April 15th of this year to hear opinions from all parties, and then the court will decide on providing advisory opinions to the United Nations.</p>
<p>Subsequently, Chilean Judge Álvarez and Albanian Ad Hoc Judge Xena were requested to stand up and take the oath of office. Raising their right hands, their oath was, "I solemnly declare that I will faithfully and honestly, impartially and conscientiously, perform the duties of a judge." After the oath, British lawyer Shawcross, the plaintiff, delivered his address. Shawcross is the current Attorney General of the United Kingdom, whose position is equivalent to our Minister of Justice. Known for his eloquence, he is physically robust and full of energy. Shawcross began by expressing his congratulations on the court's first session. He then stated, "The United Kingdom accepted the compulsory jurisdiction of the then Permanent Court of International Justice eighteen years ago. The United Kingdom is extremely opposed to war, believing it to be the product of blind impulsive forces and an uncontrollable instinct, rather than something that can be overcome by human will and reason. The British people firmly believe that the will of mankind must overcome the forces of disturbance and destruction. Therefore, resolving disputes through law and justice is the most essential and indispensable condition for the international community. Consequently, the International Court of Justice bears an increasingly important responsibility for maintaining peace this year."</p>
<p>Then, Albanian representative Ili delivered his address, in addition to congratulating the court, emphasized that "equality, justice, and sovereignty" are the three major principles that the new court should respect in performing its duties. International disputes require careful investigation and study, and can only be resolved fairly through justice. While the International Court of Justice is promoting international justice, it cannot ignore reality and the application of international law. Mutual respect among nations is essential, as peace cannot rely solely on the laws of powerful nations. Therefore, the United Nations Charter clearly stipulates that all peace-loving nations enjoy equal sovereignty, and it is hoped that the court will not overlook this point.</p>
<p>On behalf of Albania, after its representative Ili addressed the court, Czech lawyer Professor Tranek, whom they had hired, presented the defense. Tranek cited classical works and referred to the authoritative theories of international law scholars, as well as the provisions of the United Nations Charter and the Statute of the Court, making a scholarly legal argument in French, which was then translated into English by an interpreter. His speech was quite lengthy, lasting from 5:00 p.m. on February 20th to 11:00 a.m. on February 28th, totaling nine hours over four sessions. Starting from 11:00 a.m. on February 28th, British lawyer Shawcross and British Foreign Office Legal Advisor Beckett successively rose to defend their case, repeatedly emphasizing the spirit of the Charter by citing past precedents. Due to the length of the speeches and the need for translation into French, it also took seven or eight sessions to conclude. On the afternoon of March 5th, the President announced a temporary adjournment to await a ruling.</p>
<p>Summary of Arguments by Plaintiff and Defendant</p>
<p>The Albanian government believes that according to the suggestion of the United Nations Security Council, the disputed case should be jointly submitted by the parties concerned to the International Court of Justice for trial. However, the United Kingdom filed a lawsuit unilaterally with the International Court of Justice without obtaining the consent of the Albanian government in advance, which violates Article 36 of the United Nations Charter and Article 36 of the Statute of the International Court of Justice. At the same time, the Security Council's action was a "suggestion" and not a "resolution," so the Albanian government is not bound by it. In short, the British government filed the lawsuit without consulting or agreeing with the Albanian government after the Security Council's suggestion, which is not in accordance with the regulations. The International Court of Justice should not accept this case, and it also has no right to exercise compulsory jurisdiction over the Albanian government.</p>
<p>The British government believes that the Albanian government is unwilling to submit to the International Court of Justice for trial merely because of procedural issues that would harm Albania's face. The British government can immediately suggest here and now that an agreement be made with the Albanian government to jointly submit the Corfu Channel case to the International Court of Justice for a ruling. Moreover, before the Albanian government refused to submit to the trial, the British government never mentioned the issue of compulsory jurisdiction. However, since Albania did not accept this suggestion, the British government's attitude towards this case is that the Security Council's suggestion has binding force not only morally but also legally. Albania once requested to join the United Nations, and its willingness to fulfill the obligations of a member state goes without saying. Therefore, it should abide by Article 25 of the United Nations Charter and fulfill the suggestion of the Security Council. Furthermore, according to the provisions of the Statute of the Permanent Court of International Justice on March 11, 1936, non-member states can also submit disputes to the court for adjudication without having an agreement with the disputing state. If the British interpretation is incorrect, the court can be asked to clarify it immediately. In short, we cannot evade the jurisdiction of the court due to technical issues. According to Article 92 of the United Nations Charter, the International Court of Justice is the main judicial organ of the United Nations, and the British government applied based on the Security Council's suggestion. The International Court of Justice has the right to exercise jurisdiction.</p>
<p>Whether the mines that damaged British ships in the Corfu Channel were laid by the Albanian government is still uncertain. However, it is said that the reason Albania expressed acceptance of the Security Council's suggestion was that the Albanian government believed that it could be approved as a member of the United Nations at the Second General Assembly of the United Nations. Unexpectedly, things did not go as desired afterward, so it argued that there were procedural errors on the part of the United Kingdom and appealed that the court should not accept the case, thereby dismissing it.</p>
<p>General predictions are that if the Albanian government's reasons are agreed upon by a majority of judges in this hearing, the International Court of Justice will no longer hear the British government's lawsuit against Albania. Conversely, if a majority of judges believe that there were no improper procedures on the part of the United Kingdom, then the International Court of Justice will order both parties to submit the main issue of the Corfu Channel case to the court for trial. Even if Albania refuses to participate, the court will conduct a trial in absentia and make a ruling. (End)</p>

<h3>Associations of People from Disaster-Stricken Provinces Held a Joint Meeting Yesterday: Compatriots Should Be Especially Cautious Not to Be Exploited by the Communist Bandits; Request the Government to Form Armed Return-to-Hometown Teams to Fight Back to Our Old Homes</h3>
<p>The joint meeting of the Shanghai-based hometown associations of various provinces suffering from bandit disasters was held at the Lakes Society on Guizhou Road at 3:00 p.m. on the 25th. Attendees included Presidium members Ma Shuli, Gu Zhuxuan (Northern Jiangsu Hometown Association), Sun Yixiang, Chen Yide, Cao Zhigong (Anhui Hometown Association), Li Shenxun (Shandong Hometown Association), He Bolin (Shaanxi Hometown Association), Jia Yuesheng (Henan Hometown Association); guests including Mayor Wu Guozhen (represented by Zhu Fengwei), Chairman Fang Zhi, Central Committee member Ye Suzhong, Director of the Propaganda Department of the Municipal Party Committee Tan Yimin, and more than 500 representatives of refugees from various provinces. Chairman Ma Shuli reported on the significance of the meeting after formal greetings, stating that the Communist bandits have undermined unification, disrupted peace, shaken the foundation of the nation, and harmed the people's livelihood, so that even two years after the completion of victory, countless compatriots are still living a life of displacement, deprivation, and lack of food and clothing. He continued that the refugees exiled in Shanghai are willing to fight back to their old homes and engage in a life-and-death struggle with the Communist bandits. He concluded by saying that there are many Communist underground workers lurking in the city, and refugees should be especially cautious not to be exploited by them. After his speech, he invited Mayor Wu's representative Zhu Fengwei and Chairman Fang Zhi to deliver their addresses. Zhu pointed out that suppressing bandits and quelling the rebellion is the only way to stabilize China and enable the people to live and work in peace. During this period of bandit suppression, the people should cooperate with the government and the military, mobilize the strength of the people, cooperate with military actions, eliminate the Communist bandits, and build the country.</p>
<h3>Chairman Fang Instructs: "Three Suppressions" and "Three Nos" to Deal with the Communist Bandits</h3>
<p>Chairman Fang said that refugees from various provinces exiled in Shanghai should be particularly vigilant and not be exploited by Communist underground workers. The Communist bandits plan to launch the "Five Strikes and One Disaster" in Shanghai, with the so-called "One Disaster" being the exploitation of refugees to cause trouble and destruction. Therefore, refugees should strengthen unity, inspect their internal affairs, and prevent the Communists from infiltrating their activities. The Communist bandits attempt to disrupt public order with the "Five Strikes and One Disaster," so we should deal with them with "Three Suppressions" and "Three Nos." The "Three Suppressions" are: suppress local Communists, suppress foreign Communists, and suppress fake Communists. The "Three Nos" are: do not work for the Communist bandits, do not be tools for the Communist bandits, and do not be guides for the Communist bandits. Only in this way can the Communist bandits be eliminated. On the one hand, we hope that the government will step up relief efforts for the refugees, and on the other hand, we hope that the refugees will be law-abiding, obey government decrees, and not be exploited by the Communist bandits. After his speech, Central Committee member Ye Suzhong was invited to speak. Subsequently, refugee representatives from various provinces, including Northern Jiangsu, Anhui, and Shandong, such as Ling Xiaotian, Sun Tiewu, Wang Huamin, and Yang Tonglin, reported on the atrocities in the various bandit-controlled areas, with many somber and tearful accounts. In particular, Ling Xiaotian personally recounted how his brothers were killed by the bandits, and when the bandits broke into Yancheng, his parents, wife, and children were scattered by the bandits, and their whereabouts are still unknown. He escaped alone, and his words were filled with tears. The other representatives also spoke with great passion, vowing to fight the Communist bandits to the end and firmly requesting the government to organize armed return-to-hometown teams to fight back to their old homes. Finally, Gu Zhuxuan added a conclusion, and the atmosphere was unprecedentedly enthusiastic, and the meeting dispersed at 6:00 p.m.</p>
<h3>Publishing a Letter to All Circles, Exposing the Communist Bandits' Conspiracy</h3>
<p>The Shanghai-based hometown associations of various provinces suffering from bandit disasters issued a "Respectful Letter to People of All Circles," stating, "Dear compatriots: Ever since the Communist bandits betrayed the country, undermined unification, raised troops to create chaos, and launched liquidation struggles everywhere, slaughtering the innocent, our kind refugees from various provinces have been coming to Shanghai one after another, either out of righteousness and seeking brightness, or forced to leave their homes and flee for their lives, numbering no less than hundreds of thousands. We have witnessed our relatives and friends being subjected to all kinds of cruel torture and slaughter by the bandits, our fathers, brothers, and sons being forced to join the army and driven to the front lines as cannon fodder, and we are even more heartbroken that our hometowns have fallen and been disrupted and harassed by the bandits, forcing us to wander here, even without food or clothing, nowhere to live and no means to survive. Although we have been given shelter from the cold and food relief by the enlightened authorities of this city and enthusiastic people from all walks of life, allowing most refugees to barely survive the winter, we deeply understand today's tragic situation and the origins of our suffering. With tears streaming down our faces, we respectfully reveal several points to people of all circles: (1) What the Communist bandits have done in the bandit-controlled areas can be said to be completely against humanity, against reason, destroying moral principles and ethics. They use all means to implement autocratic rule by thugs and create struggles. The lives of the people can be taken at any time under various pretexts such as 'national traitor,' 'reactionary,' 'ideologically unstable,' and 'capitalist.' The people's freedom of speech and publication is even out of the question. Therefore, when we see those who have been deceived by the Communist bandits' propaganda still talking and singing about the democracy and freedom in the bandit-controlled areas, we really don't know whether to laugh or cry. Here, we want to loudly appeal to people of all circles that the Communist bandits' propaganda is all a means and a disguise. Before the Communist bandits invaded, we also had this kind of fantasy, but the facts tell us the opposite. Therefore, our compatriots in the rear, in order to protect your lives and property and avoid our current situation, must contribute money and effort to mobilize and eliminate the Communist bandits. (2) Who doesn't have parents, who doesn't have siblings? Today, we abandoned our relatives and friends, left our homes, and wandered here, not for personal safety or to prolong our lives. What we only hope for is, on the one hand, to tell our compatriots about the suffering we have experienced so that they will not be deceived again. On the other hand, we mainly appeal to the government to promptly send more troops to strengthen the suppression of the rebellion, recover the hometowns that are being ravaged by the bandits, save the millions of refugees who are suffering in the depths of misery, see the light of day again as soon as possible, and enable us, the homeless wanderers, to return to our hometowns. We will surely act as pioneers for the government and cooperate with the national army to fully suppress the bandits. We hope that the people from all walks of life in the rear will give us their strongest support. (3) In this difficult situation, in order to create rumors, stir up trouble, sow discord, disrupt social order, and undermine local security, the Communist bandits do not hesitate to use all kinds of despicable means to exploit our refugees. Regarding this issue, in addition to expressing our gratitude for the concern of all parties, we especially want to point out and ask everyone to rest assured that the plight of our refugees today is entirely caused by the Communist bandits. The Communist bandits' various conspiracies and means may deceive others, but we have already suffered from them. Any small favors or lures cannot entice or deceive us. In addition to stepping up automatic prevention and reporting and strictly abiding by government laws and not acting outside the law, we will never allow the Communist bandits' conspiracy to succeed in the slightest. Dear compatriots, the Communist bandits' ambition is definitely not limited to one area or one place. Their goal is simply to ravage and invade our entire country in order to achieve their vicious conspiracy of betraying the motherland and destroying the motherland. Therefore, whether we are in the front or the rear, whether we have been invaded by the Communist bandits or not, our destinies are indeed the same. In addition to thanking people from all walks of life for their warm assistance and warm emotions, we must strengthen unity even more in the future and strengthen the revolutionary task of suppressing the rebellion and building the country under the leadership of an enlightened leader. Finally, we want to shout: 1. Support the government's strengthening of the suppression of the rebellion. 2. Refugees, organize yourselves and fight back to your old homes. 3. Do not be incited by the Communist bandits or enticed by the Communist bandits. 4. Absolutely abide by government laws and do not act outside the law. 5. Everyone, rise up and eliminate the Communist bandits. 6. Long live the Three Principles of the People. 7. Long live President Chiang. 8. Long live the Republic of China." The telegram from Chairman Chiang to the Assembly: The telegram from Chairman Chiang is as follows: "To Chairman Chiang of the Nanjing National Government, Premier Zhang of the Executive Yuan, Minister Bai of the Ministry of National Defense, Chief of Staff Chen, Directors of the various Headquarters, Commanders-in-Chief of the various Bandit Suppression Headquarters, and Directors of the various Pacification Commissioner's Offices, all officers and soldiers of the national bandit suppression, and all people of the country: Since the disarmament of Yu and the removal of armor from the island barbarians, China has been rebuilt and everyone rejoices. However, the wicked Communist bandits have, at the time of recovery and advancement and after the people suffered from war, stirred up a great wave of internal strife, hindering national construction. The people have been plunged into misery, and the foundation of the nation has been shaken. Their madness is unparalleled. Two years after the victory, the bandit atmosphere is becoming more intense. Looking ahead, we are filled with anger. This assembly in Shanghai unanimously supports the national policy of suppressing the rebellion. The military and the people cooperate to quell the bandit scourge, strengthen self-defense forces, protect the country and defend the hometown, and await deployment. We beseech you to comply with public opinion, launch a major attack, quickly quell the rebellion, recover the bandit areas, remove the obstacles to unification and rejuvenation, and achieve the great cause of suppressing the rebellion and saving the country. The nation and the people will deeply benefit from this. We urgently submit our words, and we hope that you will give them consideration. Respectfully, the joint meeting of the Shanghai-based hometown associations of various provinces suffering from bandit disasters."</p>

<h3>General Labor Union's Letter to Fellow Workers: Strengthen Vigilance, Self-Discipline, and Self-Encouragement</h3>
<p>In response to the municipal security authorities' arrest of communist elements, the General Labor Union issued a letter to fellow workers yesterday. The full text reads: "Dear Fellow Workers: This union has received reports from various industry unions that military and police authorities have arrested several workers in recent days, requesting the union's assistance. The union immediately inquired with the responsible authorities about the reasons for the arrests. The municipal security authorities explained that based on leads from confessions of communist elements, they arrested communist elements hiding in the city and were gathering concrete evidence. There was absolutely no indiscriminate arrest. This afternoon, they invited this union and other groups and organizations to the municipal government to publicly view the evidence seized this time. After reviewing the evidence, this union believes that the government's emergency measures are based on factual evidence. Therefore, our General Labor Union hereby formally announces our attitude and position to all our fellow workers:</p>
<p>First, since the Lunar New Year, communist conspiracies have emerged one after another. The seized evidence proves that the communists have been plotting large-scale destruction of public utilities and production enterprises and inciting strikes. Recently, as the National Assembly is about to convene, the communists are preparing to cause disturbances and create a climate of terror in various parts of the Jiangnan region to obstruct the implementation of national constitutional governance. The government's measures to protect social security and promote the suppression of the rebellion are something this union supports wholeheartedly, along with all compatriots nationwide.</p>
<p>Second, the government had solid evidence and meticulous planning before this action to arrest traitorous bandits. Afterwards, they openly invited people from all walks of life to report on the process and view the evidence, demonstrating the government's determination to protect human rights and the absence of indiscriminate arrests. Therefore, we will no longer listen to any distortions, provocations, or incitements.</p>
<p>Third, the state does not protect nationals who betray the country, and society does not tolerate those who betray it. Our General Labor Union is a workers' organization, and our responsibility is to protect good workers and maintain production enterprises. Communist elements sell out the interests of the country and the nation, which is intolerable to the country and society. We certainly cannot allow them to exploit our good workers. Therefore, all our workers should strengthen vigilance, self-discipline, and self-encouragement, and expel all communist elements who betray the country and the nation from the working class.</p>
<p>Finally, we put forward our slogans: (1) Support the government in suppressing the rebellion and building the country. (2) Ensure that good workers can work in peace. (3) The union protects good workers, not communists. (4) Kick out the communist elements. (5) Expel the communist elements who sabotage production."</p>

<h3>Plain Carriages and White Horses in Front of Jade Buddha Temple: All Circles Mourn Xu Jingren, More Than 300 Friends Attending, Utmost Honor and Grief</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] Xu Jingren, a well-known figure in the industrial and commercial world, passed away in Shanghai last month. All parties expressed their deep sorrow. Fourteen units in the city, including the Zhongnan Bank, the Bank of Communications, the Jin Cheng Bank, the Four Banks Savings Society, the Dasheng Textile Company, the Defu Jin Salt Company, the Shanghai Commercial &amp; Savings Bank, the Datong Tobacco Company, the Fulimin Iron Mine Company, the Anhui Shanghai Fellow Association, Nantong College, Jingren Private Middle School, and this newspaper, held a memorial service at the Jade Buddha Temple yesterday afternoon, coinciding with Xu's family memorial. Over 300 people attended, including Chen Guangfu, Fang Zhi, Qian Yongming, Yang Hu, Shi Yonggeng, Duanmu Kai, Yan Zhuang, and Xu Jijing. Wei Xiaofu, Yan Zhuang, and Lu Tingkui first reported on Xu's life and deeds, followed by a public memorial service. The layout of the mourning hall was extremely solemn. Among the elegiac couplets sent by various circles, Yu Youren wrote, "Used commerce to uphold morality with heroic spirit; In old age, lived like a hermit in the market, braving unexpected waves." Shi Yonggeng wrote, "Remembering the time when my late father started his business, he tasted all the hardships of farming, fortunately inheriting the spirit of reform, helping those in need with his own hands; Hearing the news of Mr. Ren's passing, I am at a loss, unable to bear listening to the dirge, every household mourns with grief." Zhao Banfu wrote, "I shared a bond of brotherhood with your late father, for thirty-nine years, I treated the orphans of my deceased friend as if they were my own; This humble person is heartbroken and tearful, with a hundred million thoughts, tracing his lifelong virtues, how can I repay them." Those attending yesterday were all friends of Mr. Xu during his lifetime and the younger generation in the industrial and commercial sectors who benefited from his kindness. Plain carriages and white horses demonstrated the utmost honor and grief. Xu, originally from Dangtu, Anhui Province, was registered in Zhenjiang. He was honest, sincere, and forthright, and dedicated his life to industry. He was a close friend of Zhang Jian of Nantong and was a pioneer of national industry. He also devoted himself to finance, participating in the planning of Zhongnan Bank and the Four Banks Savings Society. During his lifetime, he enjoyed nurturing talents and supporting young people without reservation, donating land to fund Jingren in Anhui and the Shanghai China Vocational School, and serving as the president of Nantong College. When the late General Manager of this newspaper took over, he encountered great difficulties, and it was thanks to Xu's righteous assistance that it was able to continue. His contribution to culture and his generous and heroic spirit are unforgettable.

<h3>Draftees Who Drew Lots Flee, Decision to Temporarily Suspend Number Matching, Authorities to Discuss Prevention Measures</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] After the Civil Affairs Bureau drew lots for draftees in the city the day before yesterday and announced the names of draftees born in 1927 in the Huangpu District, a serious phenomenon of draftees fleeing occurred in various districts yesterday. After receiving a report from Cheng Jingyuan, the head of Huangpu District, yesterday morning, the Civil Affairs Bureau decided to temporarily suspend the lot-drawing work. Mayor Wu will convene the Military Service Association and responsible officials from relevant military service organs in the coming days to discuss measures to prevent draftees from fleeing. Pan Gongzhan, chairman of the Military Service Association, will issue a letter to the citizens regarding (1) the implementation of a voluntary soldier system and a lottery system in Shanghai this year, complementing each other, (2) the 6,000 conscripted soldiers will be trained locally, protecting the local area and not being transferred out of Shanghai, and (3) generous settlement allowances, to dissuade draftees from fleeing. According to inquiries with the Huangpu District Office, it was confirmed that draftees in various districts of the district had indeed fled yesterday. However, the exact number of those who fled had not yet been received as of late evening. The district has ordered the heads of various districts to explain the situation to the draftees and their families, persuading them not to flee. The person in charge of the district stated that the draftees' actions cannot be monitored before receiving the conscription notice and conscription ticket.</p>
<h3>Supplementary Applications for Exemption or Postponement of Conscription to End This Month</h3>
<p>It is also learned that draftees who have reasons for exemption or postponement of conscription that occurred after the application period last year can still apply to the Civil Affairs Bureau. However, in order to unify the review, the authorities have decided that the deadline for accepting supplementary applications or submitting supplementary documents is the end of this month. Any cases that are overdue will be considered as automatically abandoned. The approved exemption or postponement certificates have already been issued by the "Military Association" starting yesterday. In order to maintain order, it is stipulated that each district will act as a unit, collecting the certificates on behalf of the original applicants and then distributing them.</p>

<h3>Wounded Soldiers Destroy Police Booth, Misunderstanding Leads to Dispute, Resolved Through Explanation</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] Recently, wounded soldiers have been transiting through the city on their way to hospitals in various places. Yesterday, another thousand wounded soldiers arrived by train from Suzhou and were to transfer to the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Jiangtai ship to go to the rear hospitals in Hankou. The ship was originally scheduled to depart at 8:00 PM the day before yesterday, but was delayed until last night due to excessive loading of military rice. As a result, some of the wounded soldiers went ashore to shop or take a walk. Unexpectedly, at around 8:30 AM, two wounded soldiers walked to the front of the Bank of Communications on Zhongshan East 2nd Road and bought one catty of oranges from Chen Jinbiao (35 years old) and Fang Senmei (21 years old), who were selling oranges from a water cart. Chen and Fang asked for 35,000 yuan per catty, while the wounded soldiers offered 20,000 yuan, leading to a dispute. The two sides then started fighting, wrestling together. A policeman from the Yimiao Police Station, number 6363, arrived to mediate but was unsuccessful, so he took the two vendors to the police station. The wounded soldiers also went to the station to testify. Unexpectedly, other wounded soldiers who witnessed the situation mistakenly thought that their companions had been taken away by the police. They rushed back to the ship, gathered over a hundred wounded soldiers, and swarmed to the Yimiao Police Station on Fangbang Road, demanding that the police hand over the two vendors so that they could take them away and punish them. They also accused the police station of taking away the wounded soldiers. In the chaos, a police booth in front of the police station was damaged, and a large glass pane in the display window was smashed with wooden sticks. The police station immediately telegraphed the headquarters for instructions. Before long, a red police car arrived, and the Shanghai Garrison also dispatched a large number of military police to the scene to suppress the situation. Zhou, the chief of the Qifen Police Station, and Section Chief Qi invited the military officers in charge of the wounded soldiers to explain the misunderstanding for about half an hour, and the dispute was finally resolved.</p>
<h3>City Council and Other Groups Send Telegram to U.S. President Urging: Communist Threat to China and Europe is the Same, Urgent Hope for Full Military and Economic Aid</h3>
<p>After the closing of the Shanghai City Council's Fifth General Assembly, Speaker Pan Gongzhan, noting the rampant communists, rising prices, prevalent rumors, and social instability, believes that the current situation requires urgently uniting the middle-class intellectuals and all those who rely on wages for a living, changing their attitude of standing idly by, and actively working to urge the government to make radical reforms in politics, military affairs, finance, and economy, while intensifying the suppression of the rebellion at the front and stabilizing the rear. Only then can it cooperate with foreign aid, overcome the crisis, and prevent China from becoming a vassal of a communist totalitarian state. In recent days, he has invited the presidents of universities and leaders of social organizations in the city to carefully study the situation, hoping to contribute to national affairs. It is heard that they have recently formulated concrete opinions on political, military, financial, and economic reforms, and will issue a letter to the public to seek resonance from those who care about national affairs. The text of the telegram sent by the university presidents and leaders of social organizations to U.S. President Truman on the 25th is previewed below:</p>
<p>To His Excellency President Truman: We, the organizations and universities represented by the undersigned, wholeheartedly welcome Your Excellency's speech to a joint session of Congress in which you urged the United States to take the lead in the global fight against communism. While we cannot help but feel slightly disappointed that your speech did not specifically mention the struggle in China, we are convinced that the communist threat you described, and the need for swift action, is the same in China as it is in Europe. Your Excellency is well aware of the strategy of the Communist Party and the situation in China. Although the actual application of the Chinese Communist strategy is slightly different from that elsewhere, its basic form, and the ultimate goal of communism, are the same in both Europe and China. The conquest of China, like the conquest of Europe, is a strategic objective of communism. The Chinese people learned a lesson in the last war, knowing full well that no act of aggression can be spiritually or geographically contained. In our war against Japan, we already knew that after Japan ignited the flames of aggression in the Northeast, they would eventually spread throughout the world. We believe that from a historical point of view, the current situation is very similar to that time. If communism is allowed to gain a foothold in the Far East, the threat will inevitably extend to the peace and security of the United States and the entire world. We venture to appeal to Your Excellency to bring the Chinese situation</p>
<p>The urgent situation, to the attention of your people, and give China full and effective military and economic assistance, so that China can continue its resistance to communist aggression. Our troops urgently need a steady stream of large quantities of armaments, food, and other necessary military supplies. Our serious economic situation also urgently requires foreign aid. We believe that if the United States can provide this kind of supply and assistance today, the final balance sheet of human affairs will show that the cost of another world war is much lower. If the United States can immediately assist China without hesitation, it will be able to maintain world peace at the cost of armaments and money, rather than paying with lives and flesh. Any further delay will have unfortunate consequences. We, in our capacity as leaders of Chinese civil society groups and universities, assure Your Excellency that when American aid arrives, we will also do our utmost to enhance the spiritual, political and material organization of the National Government. We urgently hope that, with the help of the United States, Chinese intellectuals will be able to achieve their dual goals of reforming the government and containing communism.

<h3>Engineering Survey of the Duyi Section of the Hunan-Guizhou Railway, the Southwest's Major Artery (Part 1)</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Guiyang, 20th by airmail] The Hunan-Guizhou Railway is a major artery in southwestern China and is of vital importance. In the spring of the 34th year [of the Republic, i.e., 1945], in preparation for the counter-offensive against Japan and to complete the five-year railway plan, the original Hunan-Guizhou and Guizhou-Guangxi Railway Engineering Bureaus were merged to form the Hunan-Guizhou Railway Engineering Office. The office was responsible for restoring the tracks and continuing unfinished projects. The construction of the Duyun-Guiyang section was handled by the Duyi Section Engineering Office, which was organized by the bureau in the summer of the 35th year [1946]. The Ministry of Communications specially appointed Mr. Liu Jianxi, who is known in the railway engineering field for his expertise and experience, to oversee the matter. Since the establishment of the office, it has been actively carrying out construction work. Now, more than a year and a half has passed, and despite difficulties such as tight national treasury funds, transportation difficulties, material shortages, and skyrocketing prices, thanks to the concerted efforts of all the staff and workers, 25% of the entire section has been completed, which is truly commendable.</p>
<p>The Duyi section of the railway starts from Qingtaipo in Duyun County, passes through Mapo, Yongxingzhuang, Wendezhuang, Bianzidian in Duyun County, Rongbusi, Gumeng, Gudong, Leping, Wudongqiao in Majiang County, Shaping in Pingyue County, Guguan, Guanyinge, Toudaoqiao, Tailaochong, Taohuazhai, Tongbao, Mulaozhai, Zhangjiashan in Guiding County, Sanyuanchang, Longtouying, Zhimapu, Wuxingqiao, Longshi County Town, Shuiqiao, Zhongba, Meijiazhuang in Longxing County, Wangbashan, Gelaochang, Ergezai in Guizhu County, and ends in the southern suburbs of Guiyang City, with a total length of 150 kilometers. Along the line, it crosses the Wuxue Mountains of the Miao mountains and the upper reaches of the Yuan River flowing into Sichuan and the upper reaches of the Dao River flowing into Sichuan. Due to the limitations of terrain and environment, not only are the mountains high and the valleys deep, and the population density relatively sparse, making construction inconvenient, but also the most difficult part of the entire section is located in the counties of Guiding, Pingyue, Majiang, and Duyun, where American tobacco production is particularly developed and the rural economy is prosperous. The engineering staff and workers suffer greatly from the skyrocketing prices and difficult living conditions.</p>
<p>The reporter recently visited all the construction sites along the entire section, guided by the head of the Engineering Section of the Engineering Office, Wang Daoyuan, and the chief engineers and heads of various sections, who provided detailed explanations, which were very informative. The tour lasted four days, covering a total of 2,350 meters of large and small tunnels, 680 meters of large bridges, 800 meters of small bridges, 40 kilometers of material transportation roads, 1.5 million cubic meters of earth and stone work, two dining and station ticket offices, and 170 kilometers of telecommunications equipment, with a round trip of 338 kilometers. Everywhere we went, the engineering staff and workers spoke to the reporters with the most enthusiastic sincerity and the most earnest attitude about the most difficult work and the most ideal hopes. The so-called most ideal hope is that the government will allocate sufficient funds for large-scale construction as soon as possible, and promptly raise and transport the materials for large-scale construction, so that they can be responsible for quickly completing the remaining 75% of this southwest artery within one and a half to at most two years, and open it to traffic as soon as possible. They can then go to other places where they are needed to work for the construction of railways for the motherland. The reporter will now describe the findings of the tour one by one to share with readers who are concerned about transportation in the southwest.</p>
<p>Our group of six left Guiyang by jeep at 9:00 a.m. on the 11th of this month, following the Duyi section of the highway. Liu Jianxi, the head of the Duyi Section Engineering Office, specially sent Wang Daoyuan, the head of the engineering section in charge of engineering, to accompany us to visit the construction along the line. The jeep sped south at a rapid pace. Wang took the opportunity to tell me about the construction of this section of the road on the car</p>
<p>Let us have a general understanding first. At around 10:00 a.m., we arrived at Bowushui River, three kilometers from Longli County, to visit the construction of the bridge there. The chief engineer of the bridge project and the heads of the sections had arrived earlier and were warmly welcomed with scaled-down drawings, schematic diagrams, project progress charts, and written explanations. The bridge is built over the Bowushui River, about 500 meters away from the highway bridge, with a total length of 82 meters, divided into five piers and three spans, each span being 21 meters in length. In terms of bridge construction, 50% has been completed. All bridge steel structures have been shipped to Guiyang. There are currently over a hundred workers working day and night in shifts without interruption. However, the concrete required for the bridge deck does not meet the standard of nearby sand and gravel, and it is necessary to transport it from mountainous areas 28 kilometers away, which is very difficult.</p>
<p>After visiting the Bowushui Bridge, we continued south. At around 12:00 p.m., we arrived 1.5 kilometers from Guiding and turned onto a material transport road built by the Duyi Section Engineering Office, about 3 kilometers to the location of the second section. The site was the former site of the Ministry of Communications' Qianzhong Machinery Factory. After renovation, it was quite clean and suitable, and there was also a Ministry-established Rotary Elementary School. Zhang Rong, the head of the second section, is from Xingyi in this province and graduated from Nanjing Central University. He has worked in the Yuehan, Hunan-Guangxi, and Guizhou-Guangxi railways for more than 20 years and has contributed greatly to the surveying work of the Duyi section. According to Zhang's report to the reporter on the construction of the section, the second section starts from Chahe, which belongs to Majiang County, to Zhangjiashan, which belongs to Guiding County, with a total length of about 30 kilometers. There are a total of 23 large and small tunnels, with a total length of 3,608 meters. The most difficult part of the tunnel engineering is the lack of American-made yellow explosives, the TNT toxin is too heavy, and it has been difficult to purchase them in recent years. Many tunnel projects, although the blast holes have been drilled, cannot be continued due to the lack of explosives. In addition, it is also necessary to build large bridges</p>
<p>More than ten, and more than twenty small bridges. Due to the complex geology, construction is the most difficult. Among them, the Dalishu Bridge on the border between Guiding and Majiang, is 290 meters long, divided into nine spans and twelve piers, the bridge is 30 meters high, and the span is 20 meters. It is a reinforced concrete arch bridge, which is rare south of the Yangtze River.</p>
<p>The earthwork of the entire section has long been completed by migrant workers from nearby counties. The remaining small stone work will be carried out before the track is laid, which will not hinder the track laying time.</p>
<p>As of now, the total engineering of the entire section has been completed by 20%. The biggest difficulties are three: First, the funding from the Ministry is not timely. Second, there is a lack of urgently needed materials. Third, the salaries of employees are too low. In recent years, Guiding and neighboring counties have produced a large amount of American tobacco, and the local economy is abnormally prosperous, resulting in soaring prices, which is particularly alarming, and the gap is very large compared to Guiyang, the provincial capital. However, the salaries received by the employees of this section are paid according to the general living index of the Guizhou area. Therefore, the turnover of lower-level employees and those who are not enthusiastic about the project is very large, and the future is worrying. The section has organized a consumer cooperative for daily necessities, and uses spare time to run a farm, grow vegetables, and borrow wasteland to produce American tobacco. Last year, the total revenue from American tobacco was more than 30 million yuan, and each of the more than 200 people in the entire section could receive 150,000 to 60,000 yuan, but it was a drop in the bucket and did not help much. In February of this year, the food expenses for each employee were more than 600,000 yuan, and it is estimated that it will be close to one million this month. This situation will inevitably affect the progress of the project, and it is hoped that there will be concrete solutions.</p>
<p>The reporter and his party took a short rest in the second section and then went to visit the Wenjiang Temple Tunnel. The tunnel is located under Yangbao Mountain, 10 kilometers from Guiding County. Construction began on June 12 of the 35th year [1946], making it the earliest tunnel project in the Duyi section.</p>
<p>The pilot tunnel is 415 meters long and was completely opened two months ago. It is now undergoing expansion and bottoming work. Due to the poor geology and the mixture of sand and gravel, there are often collapses. After the wooden arch and stone arch are completed in the future, there will be no worries.</p>
<p>After visiting Wenjiang Temple, we returned to the second section for lunch. At 2:00 p.m., we traveled south through Guiding County and arrived at the Gumengguan Tunnel in Pingyue County at around 4:00 p.m. The director of the tunnel project, engineer Lu Yongying, and others greeted us in front of the car with great enthusiasm. The location is located on the watershed of the Yunwu Mountains, 1,600 meters above sea level, and the geology is extremely complex, making construction the most difficult. It is not only the most difficult in the Duyi section, but also ranks fourth in terms of the size of the project in the national railway tunnel projects. After resting for a while at Shaping Station, which was built near the eastern end of the large tunnel, we gathered and entered the tunnel for a visit. The pilot tunnel is 960 meters long and is divided into east and west sections for construction. The east section is 480 meters long and is managed by engineer Shen Jun. Construction began on May 1 of the 36th year [1947]. The west section is 480 meters long and is managed by engineer Zhang Zong. Construction began on March 10 of the same year. Due to the poor soil quality in the east section, it collapsed repeatedly, consuming labor and time, which delayed the work of the pilot tunnel. The west section progressed more smoothly due to the better rock quality. The highest record for the progress of the two sections was 4 meters per day. (Meng Qi)</p>

<h3>Jiaxing to Hold Rice Rationing Starting in May: Two Dou Per Person Per Month</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Jiaxing, 24th] The County Food Regulation Committee decided at a meeting at 3:00 p.m. on the 23rd to hold rice rationing starting in May. The target is the extremely poor households in the county, and each person will be allowed to purchase two dou per month, calculated at 70% of the market price. The source of the allocated rice is more than 712 shi of grain from the surplus of the 300 million grain loan, and 4,000 shi will be drawn from the grain received in the warehouse under the 36th year field tax. In addition, 3,300 shi will be raised from large households in various towns and villages, and 1,700 shi will be raised from various commercial associations, totaling approximately 10,000 shi of grain. The above two methods of rationing and fundraising have been revised and approved.</p>
<h3>The People's Livelihood in the Shandong Pacification Area</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Jinan, 22nd by airmail] Shandong is still in a stage of life-and-death struggle, and the situation is fluid and unstable, with everything shifting with military operations. Of the entire province, the government can effectively control only 17 counties, while 47 counties have fallen. There are 22 semi-controlled counties, 10 counties with controlled strongholds, and 11 counties that are frequently changing hands. These numbers can help us understand the hardship of today's situation in Shandong and the haggardness of the people's livelihood.</p>
<p>The lives of farmers throughout the province are on the edge of the subsistence line. The income from farmers' hard work is not enough to cover the expenses of taxes, and they are currently in a state of semi-starvation. According to a person in charge of the provincial government, as of February of this year, more than 40% of the people in the province were not getting enough to eat, and when the harvest approaches, at least 80% of the people will not have enough food to eat. In this situation of food shortage, the phenomenon of strong men fleeing famine has occurred. For example, in Yixian County alone, one-third of the population has fled famine. When they leave their hometowns, they carry a bag on their shoulders and are penniless, sealing the door with soil and leaving without any hesitation. Because they have sold everything in their homes, and they do not know when they will return to their hometowns, they have no nostalgia. However, within the control area of the Shandong Provincial Government, wasteland accounts for only 20% of the total area, and the food shortage is so serious. The reason is still due to the lack of seeds, agricultural tools, and labor, and the main reason is that the farmers' military burden is too heavy.</p>
<p>Among the military burdens, in addition to general taxes, the supply of troops passing through is most worthy of study. For example, Ziyang County (Duizhou) in Shandong was recovered by the National Army in May last year and is now the headquarters of the 10th Pacification District. There is a joint military-civilian station there that specializes in purchasing supplies for the needs of passing troops. From May last year to February this year, it supplied more than 9.4 million catties of firewood, more than 2.3 million catties of grass, more than 1.3 million catties of feed, and more than 210,000 catties of sorghum. The above is the supply of materials. As for the requisition of labor, the cooperative station has replaced bullock carts for the passing troops more than 9,500 times, hired civilians more than 34,000 times, and hired carpenters more than 950 times and masons more than 1,000 times. In addition, there are scattered soldiers and guerrillas who directly extort grain, firewood, civilians, and vehicles from the people, and the numbers are not included. Ziyang is a county with a population of only 200,000, and the wounds of war have not yet recovered. The current massive supply has emptied the rural areas, and both the local county government and the passing troops admit this fact. The situation is similar in other counties within the pacification area.</p>
<p>This is a very serious problem, and its direct impact is to cause food shortages and the flight of strong men. Moreover, according to General Li Yutang, commander of the 10th Pacification District, the bandits, in view of the widespread food shortage in Shandong, are putting forward the slogans of "no conscription" and "protecting refugees" in the controlled areas to attract fleeing populations, which has been quite effective. The local administrative cadres in Shandong have also recognized the location of the crisis from the difficulties they have encountered. Because if the status quo is allowed to continue, the bankruptcy of the countryside and the change in the psychology of the people will inevitably give the bandits an opportunity to absorb a large number of people who are trying to escape from production, and their strength will grow day by day, making it difficult for the suppression military to achieve complete success. Therefore, the National Army should immediately establish formal supply agencies in various villages</p>
<p>This military supply should be changed into a national burden, rather than a unique burden for the farmers in the pacification area, and on a fair standpoint, it should be borne by the wealthy households in the large cities in the rear. The Shandong authorities recognized the importance of local armed forces the earliest, and began to organize and train them a year and a half ago to assist the National Army in combat. There were originally many hidden guns among the people in various counties in Shandong, averaging at least 1,000 per county, and more in counties such as Tengxian, about 10,000 or more. In the recent battles of Zichuan, Huantai, Tai'an, and Dong'a, the loyalty and bravery of the local teams fully proved the foresight of the provincial government authorities. However, from another point of view, the existence of these armed forces inevitably increases the burden on the farmers, especially when the area is small and the population is sparse and the management is not good, this situation is even more obvious. The local Pacification Conference has also considered these issues, and has tried to agree on a method of pooling self-defense funds, by which local public opinion organs, fair-minded gentry, and local governments will jointly organize a pooling committee to implement pooling under the three principles of "accurate number of people and guns," "equal burden," and "open management." If this method is implemented effectively, the burden can be more reasonable. However, given the current poverty of the Shandong countryside, the most ideal method is to implement a combination of soldiers and farmers, integrating armed forces and production into one. In other words, local armed forces cannot allow farmers to separate from production. From the current strategy of the bandits, only this method can fundamentally strike at them.</p>
<p>Refugees in Shandong are also a problem that needs to be solved with the assistance of the central government today. The emergency relief work in Yantai and other places in the past was only a temporary emergency measure, and the fundamental problem has not been solved. There are currently 300,000 refugees concentrated in Linyi. Due to the large number of people, the provincial government is unable to cope. There are also 200,000 refugees in Heze and Caoxian in western Shandong, concentrated in the Kaocheng area, crying for food. Past experience has proven that passive relief is of no help. Not long ago, the poverty relief in Ziyang required each beneficiary to walk more than ten miles from the countryside to receive 5,000 yuan in relief funds! The effective and active relief, of course, is to use work as relief, but it cannot be organized on a large scale by local financial resources.</p>
<p>The lives of general public school employees in Shandong can be said to be quite frugal and hardworking. Except for Qingdao, the salaries of public school employees throughout the province are classified in the third category. Compared with Qingdao, if a civil servant in Qingdao can get 1.4 million, Jinan can only get 850,000. Some civil servants in the provincial capital are indignant because prices in Jinan are not lower than in Qingdao. They hope that when the central government adjusts salaries next time, Jinan and Qingdao can be listed as one level. Since Wang Yaowu took charge of Shandong, provincial-level civil servants have been allocated two bags of flour per month at a flat price. The market price is 1.7 million per bag, while the allocated price is only 220,000. In addition, two sets of cotton clothes and two sets of single clothes are issued each year, and one piece of cloth for recommended officials and half a piece for appointed officials. County-level personnel are distributed according to the provincial-level distribution. This welfare system is quite beneficial to public school employees, but according to the person in charge of the finance department, the expenditure on flour allocation is quite large, and whether it can be maintained for a long time in the future is questionable. When the press corps was in Jinan, they inquired in many ways about the suffering of the people. At that time, Liu Maohua, the chief secretary of the provincial government, and Yin Wenjing, the finance minister, replied that apart from the expenses for establishing local armed forces, no other apportionments were allowed. However, the central government allocated very little funding for national defense construction and the fodder for passing troops. Paying for this would inevitably increase the burden on the people in disguise. For example, the encircling moat project in Jinan is huge, and the people bear a large part of the expenses. A request has been submitted to the central government for compensation, but it has not yet been approved. Due to the large distance between the number allocated by the central government and the actual prices, the province has recently levied a special pacification tax on native products such as cotton and peanuts, striving not to conflict with the central government's tax sources. Recently, the central government issued an order to exempt the special tax, and everything is the responsibility of the central government. It is hoped that the central government can approve the number as soon as possible so that the province can prepare in advance. As for the provincial finances, they are extremely difficult. The budget for the first half of this year is 140 billion, of which 80% is for employee salaries, and the remaining business expenses are very few, pitifully small. The impression that the press corps gained in Shandong was that from the provincial level to the county level, the responsible personnel mostly had a clear understanding of the status quo, did not make blind optimism, and their experience and ability were sufficient to cope with this turbulent situation.

<h3>Overseas Chinese Illegitimate Son Executes His Father, Submits to Execution</h3>
<p>[Our Guangzhou Dispatch, 22nd] Ye Youpeng, an affluent overseas Chinese from America, adopted an orphaned Chinese child over a decade ago while in the United States, naming him Ye Dexing. He brought him back to China. However, Dexing neglected his studies and associated with rogues, indulging in gambling, prostitution, and drinking, doing everything wrong. In August of the 1944, he demanded a large sum of money from Youpeng. When refused, he fatally shot his father and fled to Hong Kong and Macau. Inevitably, the long arm of the law caught up with him. Two years later, believing himself to be beyond the reach of justice, he secretly returned to his village. Villagers recognized him, reported him to the police, and he was arrested. He was escorted to the Guangzhou District Court for trial. After repeated interrogations, he was found guilty of patricide, a heinous crime, and sentenced to death. This Guangdong criminal was identified on the 22nd and taken to the execution ground for execution by firing squad. Before his execution, the condemned showed no remorse. He even finished three large bowls of clear wine and four barbecued pork buns before submitting to his fate.</p>
<p>In a gesture of respect for humanity, the Guangzhou Municipal Government has recently ordered all rickshaw companies in Guangzhou to eliminate one-ninth of their total number of rickshaws every three months. Before implementing the elimination, they must submit the license numbers to the Bureau of Public Works for cancellation. The city government will send personnel to oversee the dismantling. Going forward, the numbers will only decrease, and no increase will be permitted.</p>
<p>Guangzhou's food rationing will commence on April 1st. Today, the 22nd, the distribution of grain purchase certificates began. Director Song Ziwen and Mayor Ouyang Ju personally went to the district offices to collect their grain purchase certificates. Citizens enthusiastically collected their certificates. However, some, upon seeing the notice posted at the entrance of the district office stating, "Those with outstanding taxes will not be allowed to collect certificates," dejectedly returned home. It is estimated that residents of Guangzhou with outstanding taxes account for more than half.</p>
<p>The four newspapers representing the official voice, Zhongshan (Central Propaganda Department), Heping (Executive Headquarters), Lingnan (Provincial Party Headquarters), and Guangzhou (Municipal Party Headquarters), have recently received an order from Director Song Ziwen to merge into one publication, to be named "Guangdong Daily". A joint edition will be published on March 29th. However, Zhongshan Daily, established in memory of the founding father of the nation, has a long history, so there are still many technical issues with the merger.</p>
<h3>Former Qishuyan District Chief Yu Jie Accused of Accepting Bribes and Releasing Drug Traffickers</h3>
<p>Facing Major Charges</p>
<p>[Our Wujin Dispatch, 24th] Yu Jie, the former district chief of Qishuyan District, arrested a major drug trafficker named Liu Fquan on November 26th of last year, seizing over six taels of heroin. The drug trafficker Liu Fquan was detained in the district office for over ten days, but ultimately escaped, causing a public outcry. It was widely rumored that District Chief Yu Jie had accepted a bribe for his release. After the county government transferred the police squad leader and officer Wang Haoquan to the District Attorney's Office for interrogation, the former District Chief Yu Jie and clerk Sun Guhua were found to be strongly suspected of criminal activity, and a public prosecution has been filed with the criminal court.</p>

They are currently being interrogated.</p>
<p>Pig Plague, Cattle Plague Harm Farmers</p>
<p>Hainan Island has been lacking rain for several months, and spring plowing in various places is hopeless due to drought. In addition, the pig plague and cattle plague are prevalent. Farmers, due to their adherence to traditional methods and lack of scientific guidance, are suffering heavy losses. If it does not rain, epidemics are very likely to spread, endangering people's lives. It is recorded that a plague broke out in Haikou City in the 26th year of the Guangxu era of the Qing Dynasty, killing approximately 1,700 people. Since the Republic, there have been three outbreaks of cholera: one killing over 210 people, another killing over 100, and another killing 50 or 60. During the Japanese occupation, great attention was paid to sanitation. A major cleaning was conducted every January or February, and citizens were forced to receive vaccinations and inoculations. Street vending of raw and cold food was strictly prohibited, so infectious diseases rarely occurred. Now, during this severe drought, the various health agencies in Haikou City have not yet taken preventative measures. Even on the main streets and small alleys, filthy water and silt accumulate, with a foul odor filling the air, which has not been thoroughly cleaned. If an epidemic breaks out, the future is unimaginable.</p>
<p>Taiwanese People Stranded Plea to Return Home</p>
<p>Taiwanese stranded on the island after the war were initially retained by various agencies, but have been unable to return to their hometowns. Currently, all agencies have been ordered to reduce their staff on a monthly basis. The retained Taiwanese have been successively dismissed. While some Taiwanese are still retained, their treatment and salaries are meager, barely enough to cover their basic living expenses, causing immense suffering. They earnestly hope that the government will provide them with funds to return home so that they can reunite with their families and seek alternative livelihoods. However, the post-recovery government is preoccupied with the suppression of the rebellion and has been unable to properly handle this matter. The United Overseas Chinese and Taiwanese Association in Hainan will hold a general meeting of stranded Taiwanese in Hainan on April 1st to apply to the special commissioner's office for assistance in returning home.</p>
<p>Qiantang River Tidal Bore to Reclaim 10,000 Mu</p>
<p>[Our Hangzhou Telegram, 25th] Due to the rise of sand in the Qiantang River, the Seawall Engineering Bureau has decided to first reclaim 10,000 mu of Ma Mugang, and then expand to other areas. In addition, it has been reported that the Resources Commission is developing hydroelectric power on the Qiantang River. It has come to light that the US loan for electrical equipment can only be used to order spare parts for existing power plants, and complete sets of equipment cannot be included at this time. The commission has ordered the Zhejiang Provincial Government to continue to collect sufficient hydrographic data in order to develop a concrete plan to secure foreign investment or bank loans for implementation.</p>
<h3>Six Smuggling Detection Dogs Arrive in Guangzhou</h3>
<p>[Our Guangzhou Telegram, 25th] The Central Police Department recently transported six trained smuggling detection dogs to Guangdong. They arrived in Guangzhou yesterday.

<p>Zhu Shaoliang Receives Yi Ethnic Minority Visiting Group</p>
<p>[Our Chongqing Telegram, 25th] Director Zhu Shaoliang received the Yi ethnic minority visiting group at 10:00 this morning. Head of Delegation Sun Fang presented a silver peacock, a saddle, and two pieces of fragrant jade, saying that the visiting group represented millions of Yi people paying their respects to the central government. Subsequently, Major General Luo Renjie of the Xichang Police Department introduced three delegation leaders: Na Zhidayu, Luo Ashizi, and Guo Ji Mada. He mentioned that last year, when the US military was searching for missing airmen, Na led the search deep into the Puxiong Yi area of Ning County, and his spirit was admirable. Luo was brave and skilled in battle and had helped the National Army quell the Mianning opium bandits' rebellion some years ago. Guo had surrendered to the National Army after Sun Fang persuaded him. During the meeting, Guo frankly stated that after arriving in Chongqing for the visit, he realized that the government truly had goodwill toward the Yi people. The three delegation leaders successively swore to Director Zhu that the Yi people were warlike, and if the central government needed them, they would be willing to lead troops to serve, even if it meant sacrificing their lives. Zhu also decided to send six Yi students studying in Chongqing to the Rong Army School for further education. In the evening, the Executive Headquarters' Second Political Department performed a Peking opera to welcome them.</p>

<h3>Greening Shenyang</h3>
<p>[Our Shenyang Dispatch, 21st] In early spring in the Northeast, the cold is still present, and the Shenyang spring sunshine is beginning to educate people. Students in elementary schools sit on their own small benches or bricks picked up from ruins in the open-air playground, taking a lesson on spring, giving the classroom to wounded soldiers to live in.</p>
<p>The First Mayor of Shenyang After the Takeover</p>
<p>Dong Wenqi, returned to the city government building on March 1st. His first task was to clean up the household registration and launch a anti-spy campaign. This is Shenyang's mental disinfection movement, to eliminate all rumors and germs. According to the household registration statistics, the population of Shenyang is just over one million, a decrease of one-fifth compared to a year ago. In this metropolis of one million people, as many as 310,000 are starving, two-thirds of whom live on soybean cakes, and one-third of whom wander the streets begging. Perhaps no city needs as much pity and sympathy as Shenyang.</p>
<p>Refugees fleeing from all corners of the Northeast are concentrating in Shenyang. They are surprised by what the locals see as faded prosperity, and even more surprised by the shocking prices. A simple meal in a restaurant costs tens of thousands of yuan, or one to two million legal currency. A haircut costs 200,000 legal currency, which is news to them. Among the refugees are many upper-class refugees: landlords, small businessmen, and intellectuals. They bring with them the branding of "cleansing struggles" and mental phobias. These people are mentally vulnerable, selfish, and sad, and a painful experience seems to have taken root in their hearts. The communists use these people to spread mental germs and disrupt people's nerves. The recent retreat from Jilin and the fall of Siping have greatly stimulated Shenyang. According to people from Changchun, in recent days, Changchun has been alarmed several times in one night. In the middle of the night, rumors spread that the national army had retreated. During the day, seeing the well-equipped national army, it returned to normal tranquility. Among these upper-class refugees, many are not used to eating sorghum rice and cry out for hunger.</p>
<p>The food problem makes society uneasy. The March windstorm made the thin, anemic faces of the people of Shenyang even more solemn and worried. In the last few days, prices have jumped three times a day. Rice sells for 11,000 yuan (110,000 legal currency) per catty, and people already turn pale at the mention of "rice." There are many reasons for the soaring food prices. The most powerful stimulus is the result of the panic buying of military rations. In addition, the official devaluation of the circulating coupon to one yuan for ten legal currency, huge amounts of promissory notes disrupting the market, hunger bandits along the way robbing grain trucks, the military arbitrarily seizing vehicles and horses, melting snow making roads muddy, etc., are all important factors. Seeing that the Qingming season is approaching, and looking at the wilderness, all the fields are barren. The seeds of the farmers have been robbed, and the cattle and horses have gone to the front line or are hiding in the city, and there is no way to sow on their own land. This wasted spring is related to the future destiny of Shenyang.</p>
<p>The cry for southern grain to be transported north is as loud as the roar of silver birds. Shenyang is worrying about "northern people transporting south." This is the era of aerial travel frenzy. The business of China National Aviation Corporation in the Northeast is the most prosperous. The doors of the two airlines in Shenyang are extremely busy, with cars and horses, flowers and spring breeze, and elegant ladies all rushing to catch up with the spring in the south. So peddlers and beggars also gather at this luxurious entrance. Every day the silver birds' iron wings make people excited, but strangely, it refuses to bring mail. Green-clad people have not been to our door for half a month. "Beacon fires continue for three months, and a letter from home is worth ten thousand gold." Du Fu's poem now resonates most with the people of Shenyang.</p>
<p>March is coming to an end, and the Northeast in April is visible and beautiful. Mayor Dong has proposed a plan to green Shenyang. His plan is not to decorate Shenyang with exotic flowers and plants, but to green Shenyang with vegetables and radishes. In order to prepare for the years of famine, Mayor Dong calls on citizens to increase production</p>
<p>Every barren field, every vacant courtyard, must be reclaimed and planted with vegetables and grains. If someone does not plow their own courtyard and plant beans, the mayor will order refugees to reclaim your yard. Mayor Dong plans to have the refugees cultivate thousands of acres of wasteland in Beiling and Dongling. These feudal lands, every mid-spring, are green with trees and grass, preserving the beautiful scenery for the Manchu Qing Dynasty to commemorate. This April, people who visit the mausoleums in spring will surely envy the refugees living in a beautiful natural environment! (Our reporter Zhao Zhan)</p>

Chairman Zhu Jiahua delivered the opening speech, stating that the main task of this session was to elect academicians. The term of office for the current councilors will expire on July 3rd of this year. The next session of councilors will be elected by the academicians in a meeting. The election of academicians is an innovation in our country, so this meeting is of epoch-making significance in the history of our institute and even Chinese academia. Zhu continued to explain the election criteria, procedures, and number of people, and stated that this session of the meeting will try its best to accept opinions from all parties.

After the academicians are produced, the research work will enter a new stage, and its progress will be even faster, hoping to contribute more to the country and humanity. Among the guests who delivered speeches were Dean Dai, Dean Zhang, and Secretary General Gan. Dean Dai recalled the process of establishing the Academia Sinica more than a decade ago, believing that the realization of the academicians was deeply gratifying.

He hopes that researchers will be more actively involved in research in the future in order to achieve greater success than in the past. Dean Zhang attended despite his illness and delivered a brief speech, saying that China's poverty and weakness were mainly due to a lack of academic research spirit. It is hoped that the election of academicians will stimulate the development of academic research. He further stated that scientific research is based on material, so it should be assisted by the government. Academicians can be selected this time because of the joint efforts of the Ministry of Education and the Academia Sinica.

<h3>Zhang Boling and Mei Yiqi Arrived in Shanghai Yesterday</h3>
<p>[The] Nankai University President Zhang Boling and Tsinghua University President Mei Yiqi flew to Shanghai from Beiping yesterday afternoon. They will go to Beijing in the coming days to attend the National Assembly. When President Zhang met with reporters, he said that because of his old age and illness, he had no intention of running for vice president. News reports said that people in the north attach importance to the vice president's place of origin. Zhang did not agree with this. He said: "Since it is an election, there is no distinction between north and south, no distinction between civil and military, otherwise, it is undemocratic." Zhang then, at the request of reporters, expressed his views on the current situation, saying that after the completion of the National Assembly election, the opportunity should be taken to reform politics. Although US aid is not much, it can improve the current economic problems. The most important thing at present is to suppress the rebellion. As a North China native, I cannot bear to see the people of the north in the midst of war for a long time. I will suggest that the government strengthen military power in North China and complete the suppression work as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Korean Industrialist Donates More Than Ten Mu of Land</p>
<p>Zhang then talked about the funding problem of Nankai University, saying that at present all schools are struggling financially, but I am "poor but not making trouble." After Nankai was changed to a national university, all funding was borne by the Ministry of Education, and no more donations were solicited from outside, but donations from alumni and private individuals were accepted voluntarily. Recently, Korean industrialist Sun Changzhi donated three pieces of his private land in Shanghai, totaling more than ten mu. One of them has more than 30 houses. The transfer procedures are currently being processed, and it has not yet been decided how to sell or dispose of them in the future. In addition, Sun also donated more than 100 sets of engineering machinery, which are currently being boxed up in Shanghai and transported north. Zhang also said that the most urgent and common public expense problem for students in the north is the tuition fee. He will negotiate with the Ministry of Education in Beijing this time to find a proper solution.</p>

Finally, the meeting was adjourned after the election of directors and supervisors.</p>
<h3>Scattered Transactions in Woolen Cloth; Yesterday, on Chess Street and at the Tea Party, as well as among major wholesalers, most woolen cloth transactions were scattered and small. The reason is that prices are only rising, which is favorable to buyers who are looking for news; people remain optimistic. However, due to the heavy capital required, each piece requires an average advance payment of around one hundred million yuan, and the interest expense is not small, which makes many hesitant to short sell again. Most are adopting a strategy of supplementing as they sell, so their retail business is larger than wholesale. Yesterday, Zhanghua flannel was quoted at 4.4 to 4.5 million yuan per yard, Lianxing French shirts were sold at 90,000 yuan, and Peifeng white canvas was 280,000 yuan.</h3>
<p>Sugar Prices Decline Across the Board; Yesterday, Taiwan Sugar continued to sell its products, including special grade refined white sugar and special grade coarse granulated crystal sugar, but because the distribution price had increased while actual sales were sluggish, coupled with the extreme tightness of credit, the guild's prices declined across the board. For example, the spot price of "24 Rent White" fell from 4.5 million yuan to 4.4 million yuan, "4 Half White" fell from 4.8 million yuan to 600,000 yuan, and "20 Medium Granulated White" fell from 4.1 million yuan to 4 million yuan, a decrease of 100,000 to 200,000 yuan. Warehouse receipt transactions became increasingly weak; the 12th期 (period) was about to be settled, with a premium of only 300,000 to 280,000 yuan. Some sellers of the 13th期 (period) were willing to transfer unconditionally, with premiums ranging from 50,000 to 100,000 yuan. "4 Half White" had a premium of 100,000 to 120,000 yuan. For the 11th期 (period), coarse granulated sugar was settled today at 250,000 to 200,000 yuan, and "13th Period 4 Half White" had a premium of 40,000 yuan. Furthermore, the price of coarse white sugar was down to a discount of 40,000 yuan, with some even going down by 300,000 to 400,000 yuan. Transactions in local sugar were also scarce; Xinghua white sugar was 4.35 million yuan, Xing red sugar was 2.75 million yuan, a decrease of 100,000 to 200,000 yuan. Hainan red sugar was 2.1 million yuan, a decrease of 100,000 yuan. Shantou Qing sugar was 2.8 million yuan, a decrease of 160,000 yuan. Diao Qing sugar was quoted at the original price but no transactions occurred. In total, less than 200 pieces were offered, and it is said that the market price of local sugar in Shanghai has already been turned upside down.</p>
<p>Tea Merchants Hold Firm; There is still demand for tea for export to French North Africa, and domestic sales of various grades are also quite brisk. However, the buying sentiment in the market remains diffused. Although most merchants still intend to hold firm, they are also being forced to sell due to the increasingly tight credit situation, resulting in a gradual balancing of supply and demand throughout the day. Price fluctuations have narrowed, and prices have generally held steady. However, the special Longjing tea from Meijiawu is experiencing a potential surge due to the imminent depletion of old tea and the new tea not yet being available.</p>
<p>Merchants Seek to Sell for Cash; Rice Prices Continue to Plunge; Flour, Miscellaneous Grains, and Oil Cakes All Decline; As credit continues to tighten, merchants are unable to withstand the pressure of high interest rates and have no choice but to sell their goods for cash. Moreover, prices in Wuxi have also fallen, prices of everything are declining, and market sentiment is universally bearish. With strong selling pressure at the opening this morning, prices plunged by 250,000 to 300,000 yuan. Sales at rice stores are slow, appetite is poor, and the outlook remains sluggish. The decline in the central market has not stopped. Only near the close of trading did some people from the Pudong area and some with available funds take advantage of the low prices to buy, and the market began to stop falling and stabilize, with some even recovering slightly. In the southern market, white粳 (japonica rice) finally fell by 250,000 yuan, and early thin rice also fell by more than 200,000 yuan. In the northern market, white粳 (japonica rice) and 籼米 (indica rice) fell by 150,000 to 200,000 yuan, and thin rice fell slightly by 200,000 yuan. Yesterday, a total of 6,933 石 (dan) of goods arrived in the northern markets.</p>
<p>Flour: Prices have fallen again. Although there were fluctuations in the process, they ultimately declined. There were many transactions in the market, but they were all small, scattered transactions. "Warship Flour" fell from 1.455 million yuan at the opening to 1.425 million yuan at the close, lower than the previous day by 40,000 yuan. "Old Car" flour fell by 25,000 yuan, and "Red Bee" and "Built Success" flours fell by 30,000 to 40,000 yuan each. Various miscellaneous brands of flour also declined, and bran continued to fall by 25,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Miscellaneous Grains: The decline continues, and with rice prices falling sharply, it is difficult to boost morale. Even though the cost of soybeans is not low, they must still be sold cheaply due to credit constraints. The early opening price of Zhadou (乍豆) was only 1.65 million yuan, a decrease of 100,000 yuan. However, as buyers entered the market at low prices near the close, the price rose back to 1.74 million yuan. 青島 (Qingdao) group bought few corn, and few people were interested in red sorghum, each falling by 100,000 yuan (red sorghum did not open). Mung beans also fell by 50,000 or 100,000 yuan, sesame prices remained unchanged by 客帮 (merchant groups), a decrease of about 200,000 yuan. Shelled peanuts continued to fall, with high-quality goods falling by a little 300,000 yuan and low-quality goods falling by 200,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Edible Oil: Sales on the street are slow, and there is little restocking. Merchants are eager to sell for cash and are lowering prices to sell, and factories are also making offers. Dayou Soybean Oil Factory opened at 7.25 million yuan, but the buying price fell to 7.2 million yuan. Other soybean oils are mostly at 7.15 million yuan. Dachang New Factory also made offers, but not many, and prices fell by 200,000 yuan. Raw oil also fell by 200,000 yuan, Qingdao 吉桶 (Ji Tong) raw oil was 8.7 million yuan, and raw vegetable sesame oil each fell by a little 250,000 yuan. Small cart sesame oil fell sharply by 300,000 to 400,000 yuan. 客帮 (merchant groups) did not pay attention to soybean cakes. The initial drop was 40,000 to 50,000 yuan, but as soybean prices recovered in the later market, merchants also raised prices, recovering a little 10,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Facilitating Deposits and Withdrawals for Military and Government Agencies; National Banks Decide to Add Receipt and Payment Offices; [This Newspaper's Dispatch] In order to promote and strengthen the control of treasury funds policy, the Council of Directors of the Four Joint Head Offices passed a resolution at its 359th meeting to transfer all existing public funds of military and government agencies in national banks and bureaus to the Central Bank's treasury department for management, and decided to implement it immediately. A few days ago, the Treasury Bureau of the Central Bank specially invited representatives from the Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, the Farmers Bank, the Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau, the Central Trust Bureau, and the Central Cooperative Bank to a meeting to discuss and decide that the six cities of Beijing, Shanghai, Ping, Tianjin, Guangzhou, and Hankou would complete the transfer by the end of March. Because the areas of Beijing and Shanghai are vast, and there are many agencies, the deposit and withdrawal business will inevitably increase sharply after the transfer of public funds. Since various banks and bureaus have many existing branches, in order to facilitate various military and government agencies, it is planned to set up receipt and payment offices in important areas to handle this business. In Shanghai, the Treasury Bureau of the Central Bank plans to set up two receipt and payment offices: one in Hongkou and one in West Shanghai. The Hongkou receipt and payment office will be established first. The office has found a suitable location at No. 1326 North Sichuan Road as its business address, and it is scheduled to open on April 1st. Preparations are currently underway.</p>

<p>The National Land Economic Research Office Hosts British Economic Expert Mr. Potts; [This Newspaper's Dispatch] The Economic Research Office of the Central Bank held a tea party in its reading room at 4:00 pm yesterday to host Mr. Potts, an international economic expert from the Bank of England who recently came to Shanghai. More than 60 economic experts and journalists from the city attended, hosted by Mr. Ji Yingding, Director of the office, and Mr. Fang Shangui, Deputy Director. After Mr. Ji gave a brief introduction, Mr. Potts was invited to briefly describe the organizational structure of the Bank of England. According to him, the bank's economic research department is divided into two groups: one is the statistics group, responsible for studying domestic economic and financial trends; and the other is the international group, responsible for studying the international economy. He himself belongs to the international group, specializing in the study of the Far Eastern economy. The main purpose of his visit to China is to collect economic data from your country for research and reference. The business departments of the Bank of England can be divided into four, among which the banking department (i.e., the business department commonly known as our banks) and the issuing department are the most important. The two departments are supervised by the Chief Accountant (Cashier), and the Chief Accountant is also the main officer of the Bank of England, so he also supervises the general business of the Bank of England. The banknotes issued to the public must be formally signed by him. The other two departments are the Foreign Exchange Control Department and the Accounting Department. The Accounting Department's routine business mostly involves bookkeeping and registration. Since the Labour Party came to power, the Bank of England has been nationalized. The bank has been assisting the British Ministry of Finance in its post-war economic reconstruction efforts, adhering to the government's established policies. Therefore, the bank is in an advisory position on British economic policy. Mr. Potts then held a discussion at the request of various economic experts. The tea party ended at about 5:00 pm.</p>

<p>Rampant Smuggling Between Hong Kong and Japan; Western Medicines Transported to Japan, U.S. Dollars and Gold Brought Back; [Hong Kong Aviation News] In the current Hong Kong-Japan trade, in addition to general goods that have been approved by the governments of both places to trade, smuggling is also extremely rampant. Because these smuggled goods are mostly listed as prohibited imports and exports, the profits are very high. Western medicines such as penicillin, saccharin, and shantonin, which are transported from Hong Kong to Japan, are extremely expensive in Japan. When returning from Japan to Hong Kong, if there are no suitable goods, most people bring back gold and U.S. dollars. Gold and U.S. dollars are also prohibited from free circulation in Japan, so the black market prices are very high. For example, the official exchange rate for U.S. dollars to Japanese yen is 1:50, while the black market rate is about 1:300. According to people familiar with the situation, although the profits from smuggling between Hong Kong and Japan are high, the risks are also great. Exports from Hong Kong are subject to strict inspections. Chinese customs officers also board ships to search when passing through Chinese ports. Inspections are even stricter after arriving in Japan. Various methods are used to land the goods, which are very costly, and there is often a risk of failure. Therefore, the only principle for smugglers is that the goods are light, convenient, easy to carry and hide.</p>

All principal amounts to be repaid for the winning bonds, except for the 26th year of the Republic of China Guangdong-Hong Kong River Project U.S. Dollar Public Bonds, because the additional customs tax on the Guangdong Customs, which was originally designated as the principal and interest fund for the project, was seized by the enemy and puppet forces, and the date of resumption of payment will be determined separately after the fund is cleared. All other types of bonds will be paid by the Central Bank of China, the Bank of Communications of China, the Farmers Bank of China, and the Central Trust Bureau in various places.</p>

"Guben" soap rose to 5.8 million yuan, and "Huang Xiangmao" also rose to 3.76 million yuan, with some people buying in.

<p>New Doctors and New Medicines: Should We Emphasize Quality or Quantity of Medical Personnel? By Canglong; Many, in view of the actual needs, advocate cultivating a large number of medical personnel as quickly as possible to make up for the current lack of medical personnel in China. They also say: No matter what their background is, as long as they can cure diseases, because "having" is always better than "not having."</p>
<p>Of course, those who say these things have their own insights and their own difficulties. Looking at this vast Republic of China, we know that China's medical personnel are so pitifully few, and at the same time, we can imagine how many people in the inland areas get sick and die without proper treatment. If we now want to strictly cultivate general medical personnel according to the original academic system to fill the above-mentioned gaps, then we don't know how many years, months, and days we will have to wait to achieve this goal. Therefore, their proposal is indeed quite reasonable, and I agree with it twelve thousand percent.</p>
<p>However, although this proposal for "quantity expansion" is very reasonable, there are still many difficulties in its implementation. Because in the current China, there are wars and man-made disasters everywhere, and a group of ordinary people have either died or fled, so what technical personnel are there to go to the countryside to die? Therefore, in this "quantity expansion" movement, a group of "bloodsuckers" (with a basis!) are simply added to the cities. We often see many articles criticizing doctors in the newspapers, and we have also heard many rumors that are unfavorable to doctors. Although this cannot be said to be definitely the result of the expansion of quantity, we cannot deny that it is not related. A certain manufacturer once told us that they were unwilling to sell their medicines to doctors with shallow qualifications, because they did not understand the fundamental principles of medicine and did not know how to solve problems when something went wrong. For example! We only need to look at the facts described in the article "Arrow Through the Brain" in this issue to fully reveal the pitifulness of those who have no learning.</p>
<p>Someone will of course retort to me, "According to what you say, you are probably a remarkable doctor yourself"? But that's not what I mean. No one in the world dares to call themselves "knowledgeable," because learning is endless. Today's science is changing with each passing day, and only by working tirelessly and continuing to move forward can we keep up with the trend; otherwise, we will be eliminated by the trend in an instant. Therefore, we must truly understand that if a person's foundation is not well laid, then no matter how much they want to learn well, I am afraid it will be too late. Moreover, it is simply a dream to want that group of "shortcut takers" in the medical field to study, because that group of "shortcut takers" not only cannot study, but also do not want to study. They only think about how to lie and deceive patients, so how can they have time to study those useless things?</p>
<p>Then, what is the result of "quantity expansion"? The result is just a mess. We don't want to give any examples to offend people. We only need to think about the current low status of doctors to understand the reason.</p>
<p>Alas! "Quantity expansion" of medical personnel! How many people have used your good name to commit endless sins? How many people have used your good name to expand their territory and build their thrones?</p>
<p>Nail Protection, By Yu Zhengxing; The Representative of Waste; Everyone has a love of beauty, so everywhere that can express "beauty," people try their best to make it beautiful, so that it is beautiful and modern enough. Look, now some fashionable ladies and social stars are trimming their nails into sharp points, dyeing their backs with nail polish, and adding paint, and the colors are very moving. However, this kind of decoration is of no benefit to people, but it is just a "beautiful" title.</p>
<p>Nails are a part of the skin and are an indispensable thing for human beings. Nails can protect the tender fingertips and assist fingers in picking up small items. Therefore, the beauty of nails should be based on not losing natural functions; otherwise, they are the representative of waste.</p>
<p>The nail body has no vitality, so it has no awareness or feeling. It is composed of hard, smooth, transparent material, which is just a form of what we call "retention material." However, the nail root and its attached parts have nerves and blood vessels. Nails grow not from the edge of the nail, but from the root. Because the root provides new materials. It takes four months to grow a whole nail. Because its growth is extremely slow, it can only grow one thirty-second of an inch per week. As for the growth speed of toenails, it is even slower. The relationship between the nail root and nail growth is the same as the relationship between the hair root and hair growth.</p>
<p>The nail root is very tender and is often destroyed due to blood poisoning and nerve damage. If the nail root is permanently damaged, the nail will no longer grow. If a part of the nail root is damaged, some grooves and ridges will grow on the nail surface, which are often found after suffering from fever or serious illness. Healthy nails are smooth without ridges and have a natural luster.</p>
<p>White lines or spots on the nails are formed by changes in the tissue cells of the nail bed. The cause is malnutrition or a lack of certain vitamins and nutrients. However, sometimes there may be no special reason. The nail root and both sides should be free of hangnails and redness. Paying attention to the skin can avoid hangnails.</p>
<p>Dangerous Enjoyment; When a doctor examines the nails, it has the same value as looking at the tongue and taking the pulse. Healthy nails are a pale rose-red color, which is reflected from the blood color below. Bluish nails are often due to heart disease or circulatory disorders. White, anemic nails are due to insufficient blood. Rough nails are mostly due to a lack of oil secretion in the skin. Irregular, short, thick, or worm-eaten nails are often caused by venereal disease, ringworm, or other chronic skin diseases. There are also other nail irregularities that are often found.</p>
<p>When suffering from swelling nail disease, the pain, redness, and swelling in the wrinkles of the nails must not be ignored, because this disease is mostly caused by systemic physiological disorders or by the spread of bacteria. The most common cause is hangnails. After washing your hands, when the skin is still very soft, use your fingers to push and rub towards the root of the nail, and apply some preservatives. Small sores and breaks near the nails heal very slowly, often delaying for several weeks, but are relatively painless. This may be a possibility of venereal disease and should be consulted by a specialist. Nails are often deformed during the course of typhoid fever, pneumonia, and tuberculosis. When the lungs have chronic diseases, the nails are mostly large and curved. When there are transverse ridges on the nails,</p>

<h3>Peking University's Fiftieth Anniversary - Launching Fundraising to Build Cai Yuanpei Auditorium</h3>
<p>[Report from Central News Agency, Nanjing, dated the 24th] Hu Shi launched a fundraising campaign by Peking University to raise 100 billion yuan to build the Cai Jiemin Memorial Auditorium as a gift for Peking University's 50th anniversary. Peking University alumni in Nanjing, such as Di Ying and Yu Yousun, responded enthusiastically. Hu Shi wrote to Peking University alumni in various places, stating: "Peking University, originally known as the 'Imperial University,' is the successor to the imperial academies of past dynasties. The system of imperial academies began in the fifth year of the reign of Emperor Wu of the Han Dynasty (2035 BC in the Chinese calendar, 124 BC in the Gregorian calendar). We can very well say that Peking University has a history of 2,072 years, making it the oldest university in the world. Although this calculation is inevitably a bit of 'showing off our age,' we have always only counted the Imperial University, which was established in the year of Wuxu during the reign of Emperor Guangxu (14 BC in the Chinese calendar) as the beginning of the new life of our school, and this year marks its 50th anniversary. Teachers, students, and alumni in various places all want to celebrate the anniversary of Peking University, so there are preparations for the 50th anniversary. The methods are roughly divided into two aspects: one is to use the achievements of academic research as a gift, and the other is to establish a public construction for the 50th anniversary. In terms of school achievements, each college has begun to collect the research achievements of each college and has planned various academic publications and lectures. In terms of commemorative construction, we have sought the opinions of alumni in various places, and everyone advocates concentrating efforts to raise donations and build a large auditorium. We feel that a large auditorium that can accommodate one thousand or more people is the most urgent need of Peking University today, so alumni in Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin, and other places all agree to pool the strength of alumni across the country, raise donations, and build a large auditorium in the Sandatan area, which will be called the Cai Jiemin Memorial Auditorium. We have asked several architectural engineering experts to design it, and roughly calculated that the construction and internal equipment will require 75 billion to 100 billion national currency, which cannot be borne without great strength. We all think that this matter must be promoted by you to have any hope of success, so I, on behalf of the faculty and staff of Peking University and alumni in various places, sincerely request you to take on this matter, and please do not decline."</p>

<h3>Gains from the Automotive Transport Expedition - Wang Shixuan Talks About the Key Points of Basketball Success</h3>
<p>[Report from our Chongqing office] The basketball team of the 16th Automotive Transport Regiment, from its first match with the Xingguang team in Guiyang on October 7, 1947, to its 61st match with the Guizhou Sports Association team on February 27, 1948, has been on expedition for more than five months, with 46 matches on the outward journey and 15 matches on the return journey. Except for defeats to the Haihua United and Dagong teams, all other matches were won, which can be considered a successful return.</p>
<p>Wang Shixuan, Deputy Regiment Commander, regretted that the 16th Automotive Transport Regiment only played against the Hualian and Dagong teams once each in Shanghai. He said: "It is not easy for a team from another place to go on an expedition to Nanjing and Shanghai. A team with slightly weaker strength will be struggling and unrewarding." He cited many examples to explain, especially regarding a certain Shanghai newspaper's description of the Gangguang team's trip to Shanghai to participate in the competition as "going to class," and felt deeply moved.</p>
<p>Leader Wang frankly stated the advantages of Hualian and Dagong. His conclusion is worth pondering. He believes that only one Hualian or Dagong team is not terrible. In the two battles, he has already experienced the strength of his own team. Combining his opinions, a successful team must have the following five conditions: First, the players must be tall and energetic. Second, master basic movements. False moves are useless. Third, strive for changes under basic principles. Fourth, use small arm movements in the defense zone, which is not only effortless but also makes it difficult for the opponent to defend. Fifth, do not count success or failure, and play more matches. Therefore, the 16th Automotive Transport Regiment had almost one match every day during the journey, except for taking cars and boats, and even had three matches in one day. The mission of this expedition can be said to be: (1) To create a military sports foundation, (2) To shift the focus of life in the military, (3) To cultivate military sports talents. He always believes that American basketball players are the most standard in the world, and height is the only condition. Unless you score, the ball can always be in the hands of the tall players.</p>
<p>When our reporter asked him: "Did you recruit any new players during this expedition?" He replied: "There is only one Liu Xuekuan in Guiyang, who is particularly tall. With training, he can be cultivated in the future."</p>
<p>In addition to donating 80 million yuan from ticket sales to the Shanghai Sports Journalists Association and winter relief refugees, the 16th Automotive Transport Regiment also donated: (1) 60 million yuan for the construction of the Jieshou Hall stadium in Nanjing, (2) 60 million yuan for the construction of the 9th Automotive Transport Regiment stadium in Hankou, (3) 20 million yuan for the construction of the Youth Regiment stadium in Hangzhou, (4) 70 million yuan for the repair of the Guiyang prison facilities. Fans in Nanjing and Shanghai who love the team can find their tracks again at the Lizhi Society Stadium in Nanjing on April 16. At that time, the basketball team of the 16th Automotive Transport Regiment will represent the Chongqing area's Joint Logistics unit to attend the comprehensive sports meeting held by the General Headquarters of Joint Logistics.

<h3>Regulations on the Handling of Unlicensed Materials - Supplementary Regulations Made by the Transport Management Committee</h3>
<p>[Report from our office] The Transport Management Committee previously announced that for those who bring foreign exchange into the port without a license or have exceeded the validity period for applying for the purchase of goods, they should all be handled in accordance with the wool handling method in Announcement No. 21, starting from the date when the China Trust Bureau announces the allocation price of the goods. Now, supplementary regulations are made: (1) For all goods for which the allocation price has been announced by the Central Trust Bureau before Announcement No. 22 of this Committee on February 18 of this year, (1) the validity period for applying for the issuance of a bill should be calculated from February 18 of this year. (2) For all goods for which the allocation price is announced by the China Trust Bureau after Announcement No. 22, it will be calculated from the date when the allocation price of the goods is announced. Other regulations should still be handled in accordance with Announcement No. 24.</p>
<h3>Tight Monetary Conditions Remain - Yarn and Cloth Market Continues to Be Soft</h3>
<p>Yesterday's cotton yarn market conditions were quite plentiful, because the Fangjian Company supplied a lot every other day. The market opened lower in the morning, and then replication manufacturers saw low prices and entered the market, and 42 counts of Lanfeng fine yarn were traded at 190 million yuan in the middle of the day. However, due to the continued tight monetary conditions, there was supply at high prices, and the market atmosphere was weak again. Finally, the market closed slightly lower at 170 million yuan, a continued drop of 6 million yuan compared to the previous day. Baoguang and Jincheng both fell by about 7 million yuan. There was a slight appetite for 32 counts of various brands in the market. Except for Lanfeng, which remained unchanged, the prices of Yinyue, Fengnian, and other brands rose by 3 to 4 million yuan. Due to arbitrage transactions, the market trend of 21 counts of Shuangma yarn stopped falling and rebounded. The closing price of a Shuangma voucher was 100.7 million yuan, and the spot price was 110 million yuan, an increase of 7 million yuan. The market for 20 counts of Shuangma yarn turned stronger due to strong demand from Hakka merchants, and the market sentiment was bullish. Prices generally rose by 2 to 4 million yuan. The supply and demand of 10 counts of coarse yarn were balanced, and the price remained stable.</p>
<p>The cloth market was encouraged by the news that the Southern Transport may be opened when it opened in the morning. Longtou fine cloth opened at 4 million yuan. Due to the supplementation from Shanxi merchants and the filling of floating vacancies, the buying spree once unfolded, and the price rose to 4.11 million yuan. Later, after 10 o'clock, some colleagues still had tight positions and sold heavily at high prices. At the same time, dyeing factories rarely asked about low-grade fine cloth, and transactions turned dull. In general, retailers competed to sell each other, and the selling atmosphere in the market suddenly became strong. The price rebounded downstream and gradually fell below the 4 million yuan mark, closing at a low of 3.97 million yuan, an increase of 80,000 yuan compared to the previous day. The rest of the low-grade fine cloth continued to be weak. The prices of Sijunzi gabardine and true tribute cloth rose by 115,000 yuan due to the scarcity and good sales. In addition, Qilin cloth and blue cloth both fell.</p>
<p>Also, it is reported that the Longtou B-character fine cloth supplied by Fangjian Company yesterday was priced at 3.65 million yuan, and many people applied for purchase orders with a price increase of 40,000 to 60,000 yuan. The yarn and cloth management committee did not purchase spot cotton yesterday, and the transaction was not prosperous. However, the trend of yarn and cloth rising and then falling has been hovering. The internal monetary conditions of the industry are tight, and the goods owners have sales, and the foothold is very soft. Fangjian purchased 1,000 dan of cotton seeds yesterday, with a delivery price of 15.3 million yuan in Zhoupu, and a price of 3.82 million to 3.855 million yuan for seed cotton.</p>
