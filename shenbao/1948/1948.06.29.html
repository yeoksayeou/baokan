<p>〔本報北平廿八日電〕庸楡段匪軍續北潰，今日空軍報告，國軍正配合空軍分股追擊，今日東行車通車家店。</p>
<p>〔本報秦皇島廿八日電〕冀東東西兩路夾擊國軍，西路已迫近昌黎，東路於廿七日夜八時攻克北戴河東北起雲寺高地。惟匪對秦島留守營間威脅尙大，國軍正努力掃除。北戴河西北盧王莊廿八日有惡戰。</p>
<p>〔本報北平廿八日電〕沉寂已久之平津保三角地帶，戰事復起，咎崗·板家窩·胡各莊（俱在雄縣覇縣間）一度失守，廿六日地方團隊與匪軍七縱隊三千餘遭遇，匪一度突入西南陣地，國軍援於後，卒將咎岡·板家窩·胡各莊收復，匪向東南潰退。</p>
<h3>當前情勢確至危急　同舟共濟完成戡亂　白崇禧在漢歡迎會上演說</h3>
<p>〔本報漢口廿八日電〕武漢各界歡迎白總司令大會於今午後三時在漢舉行，何成濬，張篤倫，方覺慧等先後致歡迎詞，咸以熱切心情期待戡亂早日成功。旋由白氏發表演說，指出單純的軍事剿匪業已失敗，吾人不能諱敗爲勝，今後欲求戡亂建國大業完成，必須黨政軍均能改變作風，與民更始，澈底實施總體戰，務期以軍事掩護政治經濟，作到掌握壯丁，掌握糧食，掌握情報，以進而安定民生，實現耕者有其田。白氏稱；爭取點綫的戰略，實已落伍，吾人必須針對共匪陰謀，加强全面的控制。最後指出武漢組訓工作徒具形式，並列舉鄂東軍民合作之效果，籲請鄂中鄂北及各地民衆均能協助國軍，共同肅淸殘匪。白氏以警惕口吻謂：當前情勢確已至兵臨城下，吾人必須同舟共濟，以自覺自動之心情，參加戡亂工作。按：白氏所稱鄂東軍民合作之效果，即指筏間可以出動作戰，連排亦可單獨行動，實爲軍事上一大進步。</p>
<p>〔又電〕據白總司令在各界歡迎會上稱：（一）剿總轄區與外傳稍有出入，大致仍以豫鄂皖三省爲限；（二）鄂中決設綏靖署將以張淦任司令官；（三）國犯皂市之匪昨被擊潰，應城西南亦已解圍。另息：張淦·王凌雲·霍揆彰已先後抵漢，將出席剿總軍事會報。</p>

<h3>翁文灝函覆監察院　說明穩定物價情形　軍費龐大通貨膨脹仍難免</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿八日電〕監院前以物價狂漲，當局未聞有及時之措施，曾向政院提糾正案一件，頃政院已就辦理穩定物價情形及監院所提各點覆函送達監院，茲誌如次：</p>
<p>本年六月十六日憲法字第一四號公函敬悉，查平抑物價之辦法，不外戡平內亂，安定社會，增加生產，充裕供應，改進交通，便利運輸，推廣輸出，發展國家貿易，整理財政，抑制通貨膨脹，以治其本。取締國積居奇，厲行議價，限價，禁止金鈔流通，管理外匯，緊縮銀根，以治其標。文灝受任行政院畏以來，籌慮未嘗稍懈，近日物價暴漲，復針對事實，採取下列措拖：（一）加强金融管制，防止濫發本票，以免信用　脹，刺激物價。（二）推銷國庫券，抽緊銀根。（三）派遺負責人員趕赴華北，改善匯兌辦法及在華北拋售物資，並飭由糧食部頒訂調劑民食緊急措施辦法，訂購洋米，繼續舉辦都市配售食糧，以安定社會人心。凡此皆屬政府今日力所能及之緊急對策，然而目前各戰區軍事仍甚劇烈，軍費支出仍甚龐大，通貨膨脹之事實，一時仍然無可避免，則物價上漲之趨勢，亦難望其迅速停止，而有待於政府及全國人民共同瞭解時艱，共同努力，以發揮前述各項洽本辦法之效果，本院決當排除萬難，盡瘁以赴。</p>
<p>至於原案所指行政當局助長物價上漲之各項舉措，爲期貴院委員明瞭事實，茲併分項說明於后：</p>
<p>國家行局貸款　審核未稍寬假</p>
<p>一·國家行局貸款，前爲防止流入投機市塲，刺激物價，曾於三十六年十月底停止辦理，嗣因一般正當生產事業以資金缺乏，無法興辦，或周轉不靈，不得不自本年三月起恢復貸款，然爲預防流弊，經四聯總處理事會核定，訂有三十七年度生產事業貸款方針（附奉），關於貸款之核議，規定綦嚴，生產事業貸款之對象，以1民生日用必需品之生產運銷事業，2基本工礦事業，3公用通事業，4出口貿易事業等爲限，其貸款方式，亦經規定如下：1定貨貸款或收購製成品，2委託產製，3短期資金周轉，包括出口打包放款等，4其他與國家經濟政策有關之貸款。數月以來，所有貸款案件，均係依此審核，未稍寬假，對於貸放款項，並經分別規定責任，切實考核，務期均能按照原定款，尚難謂為放任。至於貸款利率，依照上項貸款方針，對於一般自負盈虧之生產事業，係以參照市塲利率計算爲原則，但不得超過當地中央銀行掛牌市息，而完全配合國策之貸款，仍照低利原則辦理，是放款利率，亦難謂爲過高。</p>
<p>國營交通事業　領導漲價非實</p>
<p>二·國營事業所供服務之價格，以一般物價上漲不已，成本激增，不得不隨同調整，以資維持。郵電鐵路等，歷年以來雖値國庫奇細，仍按虧損情形，酌予貼補，則更非專賴加價，用意所在，亦無非避免刺激物價，故國營交通事業運價郵電等，在一般物價步步上漲聲中，僅屬跟蹤調整，相距甚遠，如本年五月物價上漲，約及戰前五十餘萬倍，運費僅及一十三萬餘倍，六月初運費調整，亦僅戰前二十餘萬倍，如此而謂爲領導漲價，殊非事實，附上物價及運價統計圖表三份可供參考。</p>
<p>改革幣制問題　政府處境困難</p>
<p>三，近數月來，國內輿論督促政府改革幣制之言論，發布甚多，立法院立法委員，亦多以此詢問，本院因有着手研究之答復，但對於改革內容，從未提及，蓋深恐影響市塲，而政府金融負責人員亦未作任何倡導。查法幣貶値，已至今日之階段，政府旣無法否認通貨膨脹之事實，立法委員及學者專家，又羣望早有根本之謀，政府處境實極困難，今後政府固應格外愼重，尤盼社會中之領導人士皆能共體時艱，在研究與準備未臻完密之前，儘少發表空泛而富有刺激性之言論，如此則貴院所顧慮者庶畿可免矣。</p>
<p>以後貴院對於行政工作，如有應行查詢之處，本院定當隨時提供資料，忠實說明眞相。</p>
<p>以上關於本案辦理情形及經過事實，准函前由，相應復查照爲荷，此致監察院</p>
<p>鈔附中央中國交通農民四銀行聯合辦事總處三十七年度生產事業貸款方針一份。</p>
<p>檢送運價調整與物價增漲比較圖一份說明一份運價調整與物價增漲對照表一份。</p>
<p>本年六月初物價與運價比較圖一份說明一份。</p>

<h3>蘆田內閣的危機</h3>
<p>搖擺欲　的日本蘆田內閣，渡過一個月來的風險，因得盟軍總部政治局的支持，政權是暫時獲得穩定；但並非完全得到安定的保障。日本國會反對黨正在進行的倒閣運動，如火如茶的發展，蘆田均能否安渡難關，使預算案和西尾貪汚案風平浪靜，實在不無疑問。即使盟總有引導日本政潮渡過彼岸之力，麥帥勸吿日人停止政治鬥的努力，會收一時的功效，但到了七月，蘆田內閣是否會不發生變化，誰也不敢下斷語了。</p>
<p>蘆田內閣自成立以來，僅有三個多月；而三月來遭遇的挫折，比三年政權的危機，格外險惡；善以權變著稱的蘆田均，也感進退維谷了。東京共同社最近發出電訊，說「蘆田內閣之垮台，已可計日而特」。一般觀察家也認爲「蘆田內閣刻正向一政治絕境前進」，足繳三月以來蘆田遭遇風險之大，危機之深，憂息之重。事情的發展和演變，可分下列幾方面來說：</p>
<p>第一，蘆田內閣的得意傑作，是「經濟復與五年計劃」的宣佈，照這計劃實施，日本在一九五二年就可壯大起來，而美國官方也很支持這個計劃。本計劃的澈底實施，需要美國的資金和原料，美政府曾向國會提出貸款日本案，以助其初步計劃之開展。由於中國澳洲菲律賓等國的不安，和輿論的反對，美國會對日貸款减去一億五千萬，即减去全部　援七分之三。這是蘆田內閣意想不　的一棒，本來可以受到日本人民擁護的蘆田內閣，在這當頭一棒擊來之後，日本人民對蘆田的信念發生了動搖，甚至與論界也懷疑五年計劉的成功。這可以說是蘆田內閣遭遇的最大風險和挫折。</p>
<p>第二，蘆田內閣於月前擬定了本年度的預算案，準備在本屆國會中提出通過。預算案中列入停付戰債利息一年的辦法，並爲了增加政府財政收入，所以預計在國家總收入一，九〇六，〇〇〇，〇〇〇日圓中，徵收一，〇〇〇，〇〇〇，〇〇〇圓的稅收。這個辦法，乃社會黨左派的主張，未實行於片山內日閣，而造成了片山內閣內部的危機；民主黨與社會黨左派合作，左派即以此項政策爲條件。政策是正確的，可惜日本納稅人——財閥集團及其豢養的保守政黨（如自由黨和民主黨右派），在國會中激烈地反對，並且在會外散佈謠言，以致民生民主黨右翼份子八名的脫黨。蘆田領導的民主黨，在國會本來是少數黨，今番由九十二席减至八十四席，甚有繼續减少的可能，致使蘆田地位愛到更脆弱了。現在蘆田內閣在國會的支柱力，完全要靠社會黨的左右兩派了。</p>
<p>第三，社會黨右派以現任副首相西尾廣造爲主體，在國會中相富具有支配力。最近西尾發生了一件不名譽的事件，有人提證檢舉他食　舞弊五十萬日圓；這是在日本政治史上很大的汚點。現在這件貪汚案，正由最高檢察署進行偵查，西尾於十日曾表示願辭職引退，並願接受社會黨內部的整肅，可是蘆田均支持他，並想根本打消這件檢舉案。社會黨領袖片山哲，十五日發表談話：「西尾係現任閣員，應候調查明白後，再決定是否必須辭職問題。」照片山和蘆田的意思，預算案通過前，西尾是不辭職的；預算案通過後，西尾順應環境辭職。盟總政治局的看法也是如此；所以蘆田的作法，可能是以犧牲西尾而換取預算案的通過，，他完全是爲了政權的復活着想。國會的反對黨是否接受蘆田的意見，實不無疑問；而社會黨有六十三個議員表示異議，迄今尙未獲得協調，實爲預算案通過問題埋伏了無窮的危機。</p>
<p>以上事實的發展，說明蘆田內閣的走向「政治絕境」，原非偶然，實在是有根據的一種觀察。照大勢看，蘆田內閣在盟總的支持下，暫時可以獲得穩定，如蘆田穗權變運用成功，國會的風浪大概也可能平安渡過。但，一度難關的渡過，並不能根本解除蘆田均的危機。到那時，蘆田的作法有二：（一）西尾副首相辭職後，掉換政略進而與吉田茂合作，吸引反對黨久閣；（二）舉行全國普選，改組政府。上項兩條途徑，無論蘆田均走那一條，他不外爲保守勢力作些舖路的工作罷了。</p>

<p>運價調整與物價增漲比較圖（從略）錄其說明如次：</p>
<p>（一）該圖表示：運價上漲，雖隨同物價上漲，有相同之趨勢，但自卅五年以後，遝價調整倍數，對物價倍數均保持相當比例，前者僅佔後者百分之二十五左右。</p>
<p>（二）但今後物價愈高，即運價之成太劇增，前項比例之維持，自屬極端困難，但兩者倍數之絕對値，則仍然相距甚遠。本年五月份，兩者相差三十餘萬倍，今（六月）運費雖已調整，兩者相差則尙不止此數也。</p>
<p>本年六月初物價與運價比較圖（從略）錄其說明如次：</p>
<p>該圖係以四月一日上次調整運費時之價格爲標準，由此觀察可得二點：</p>
<p>（一）五月份運費並未調整，而金價米價已上漲一倍以上，煤價布價亦漲百分之六十以上。</p>
<p>（二）六月初運價調整後，各物上漲之趨勢大致仍舊，（煤價暴漲，先於運價，金價暴漲，後於運價將近半月。）似均不能認爲運價領導物類。</p>

<p>這是一個並不怎樣整潔的孩子，大約約一四歲，椶黃色皮膚，套着件花布裙子，赤脚，着雙布鞋。想是不會說話，只是哀哀地哭着。手裏却抓着十幾顆糖花生，「這不知是誰家的，倒是蠻好的小孩。」一個穿黑香雲紗的女人說。「想來是迷了路了。」有人在接口。</p>
<p>但是一個園丁在孩子的背上檢出了一張小字條，筆跡雖不秀麗，寫的却還端正，我上前去一看，是這樣幾句：「該可憐的女孩，她今年四歲了，因爲她的生父失業四載，而她的生母把她拋棄了，在無辦法中，望請仁人君子，拾回扶養已收她的殘生」下面沒有具名，當然更不會有地址·</p>
<p>園丁抱起了孩子，孩子還是不休地哭，有人給她一張千元的關金，她也不要，丟在地上·「這是誰家的孩子啊——」憐憫的聲音在空中飄盪。</p>
<p>還是管公園的想出了主意，送警局。二七四號園丁憐憫地輕輕抱起這無援的孩子，出了園門，向海關那邊走去，不一會便消失在江干的人羣裏。</p>
<p>你也有孩子麼？他們却不要了！</p>

<p>〔本報南京廿八日電〕滬工商業反對臨時財產稅請願代表勞敬修等十二人，廿八日晨抵京後，首赴中央黨部訪吳秘書長鐵城，聲述反對該稅理由，請國民黨予以支持，吳氏當允將此事轉陳中政會考慮。繼至立院訪張秘書長軍元，請准列席午後財政金融委會討論該案之小組會議。旋往訪王財長雲五，王氏吿以此事非財部發動，國家需增加稅收爲一事實，然絕未與劉不同委員唱雙簧，渠笑稱如至立院，更可得知詳情，甚至有所收穫，蓋此事決定權實操諸立院手中。下午四時代表一行，復列席立院財金委會臨時財產稅及淸查豪門資本小組會議，由潘士浩·胡西園·劉靖基三人報吿反對徵收臨時財產稅案理由。下午五時訪孫院長，孫氏謂渠爲立院院長，未便表示意見。唯此事猶在討論中，盼努力爭取立委同情。六時訪翁院長，其答覆與王財長略同，政院對此事胥視立院如何而定。各代表晚八時許出席京市商會及營造業公會聯合茶會，就此事交換意見，決定廿九日晨間往立院請願，並將聯合全國工商業採一致行動。</p>

<h3>提案尚餘百件　延會與否未定</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕參會六次大會今日舉行第六次會議，本定當日下午六時舉行休會禮，惟會議迄今，討論完畢者，經民政，財政，公用，警政等四組提案。尙餘社會，市長及議長交議案，複議提案，工務，地政，敎育，法規，預決算，及臨時動議等提案共達一百十餘件，今日會議，勢難全部結束，是否延曾，尙待大會作最後之決定。</p>
<h3>輪船業客貨運價　即日起暫加八成　航空運價亦玢予以合理調整</h3>
<p>輪船業公會，以原定運價實難維持成本，曾於上週初議決調整百分之八十，並呈報交通部，惟交部迄無示復，而物價一再上升，該業公會昨再度召開緊急會議，議決即日起所有各綫客貨運一律暫加百分之八十，同時再以最近輪運支出成本計算，要求交部再作合理之調整。</p>
<p>又關於中國中央二航空公司之運價調整問題，交部迄未批覆，據中航公司負責人稱：即使運價調整百分之一百八十，事實上仍難維持，中國民航之運價，實爲便宜，試作一比例，現由上海至北平每客票價爲三千八百七十萬元，合美金僅八元餘，而在美國每一小時之空運運費需十七元美金，由滬赴平計四小時，則需六十八元美金，故中國之民航事業，亟望政府能澈底明瞭此種情形，俾作合理之解決辦法，否則隨時可發生因難予維持而停航之事</p>
<h3>強姦被服廠女工　劉芳榮昨日受審</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕長壽路滬西被服廠女工章琴蘭，十六歲，略有姿色，致爲同廠男工劉芳榮（江西人年廿二歲）所埀涎，於去歲九月間遭劉誘往中山公園及大世界等處遊玩後，並在膠州路華通旅館內姦宿一宵，被破貞操，旋於十二月卅一日，又爲劉騙至康定路忻康旅館續姦一次，結果至本年五月間爲章之姑母發覺，乃報吿警局將劉拘捕後，移送地檢處訊辦。劉對上情供認不諱，惟稱係曾得章女同意，但地檢處以章女被姦時，實足年齡尙未滿十四歲，法法應以强姦未成年女子罪論處，邃提起公訴，昨晨由謝志英推事在刑八庭提訊後，諭令改期再訊。</p>
<h3>中山西路血案　母舅謀財起意　行刼砍傷甥女</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕龍華警分局廿六日中午零時四十分許，據報在中山西路漕溪路附近，有女孩一名，被人砍傷，性命垂危。當經正副分局長周鏡波·嵇中崙，飭股長郭繼田，親率股員許鎭衡，警長葉錦濤，幹警陳榮貴·王良伯。楊斌等趕往出事地點，調查眞相，獲悉被害人名張靜艷，十二歲，頭部被砍一刀，右手臂被砍兩刀，當時神志昏迷，當經員警飛送中山醫院施救，出事處遺有銳利新菜刀一柄，血漬斑斑，又手帕一方，髮夾數隻，書包一只，比至下午六時左右，傷女張靜艷已能言語，據稱：家住鉅鹿路三三七號，父名張啓棠，在北京東路開設五和五金號，我在鉅鹿路同義中小學四年級肄業，今午放學歸家午膳時，突有大伯父之妻弟我呌他母舅之楊記根（見圖），騙我同乘三輪車至龍華鄕下，下車後行至墳山背後，楊將我一推倒地，取出新切菜刀，向我猛砍數刀，將我手上金戒，强行捋去而逃。我斯時遂昏迷不省人士云云。員警聆語後，即通知女父到局，獲悉該犯楊記根，年僅十九，不務正業，家住老西門西林後路瑞邨三號樓上，郭股長亟飭幹警黃連鄕·高志禹·黃瑞林等，至各遊藝塲所，輪埠車站等處查訪，一面遴選幹警至其寓所守候，翌晨八時，該犯果返家，當被員警拘獲，帶局偵訊，供認行兇不諱。該分局以案情已明，昨將兇犯移送地檢處究辦。</p>

<h3>消滅私運便利工商　開放華南匯款限額　市場如有涌動國行可隨時停匯</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕據悉：金融當局自昨日起，開放蔁南匯兌。過去華南之匯款，以五千萬元爲限，過此須申請核准，自昨日起取消此項限額。當局此項措施之目的，在消滅私運現鈔及便利工商，但爲預防華南物價因之而發生波動起見，央行得斟酌物價及市塲頭寸情形，隨時有權宣佈停止滙兌，將原款退回。問時，過去華南對滬市之匯款，原以二億元爲限，此項規定亦於昨日同時取消。</p>
<p>又訊：前經財部頒訂施行之內滙及運現限制辦法，現仍繼續有效，並無變更。外傳內滙開放之說，並非事實。惟國行對於同業調撥頭寸，調往穗滬兩地之原定限額，（國家行局每週一百至二百億元不等商業行莊每日十億元）現巳取消。凡同業根據限制內匯辦法辦理匯兌，要求國行調撥頭寸者，目前已無地域上或數額上限制。此項措施，國行係接受國家行局之一再要求而予規定者。</p>
<h3>東北流通券停兌　平津物價均猛落</h3>
<p>〔本報北平二十八日電〕平津今開始停兌流通券，物價普跌，黑市亦停。以收流通券爲業之商販，二十六晚起，即已拒收。二十七日有小成交者，收價急降爲八元，今已無人收進。同時物價猛落，金銀尤甚，黃金落至一億七千萬，銀元一七五萬，兵船粉八五〇萬，落二〇〇萬，布平盤，其他皆落。國行惜將短期庫券之發售折扣率降低爲八五點二，利息則加至二三分，北方物價可望因此保持短期之小康。惟此措施，顯已影響國行之旣定政策。在津之夏李王三要員，決赴東北一行。津金管局長施奎齡同往，華北剿總今下午有重要經濟會議。</p>
<h3>新買接踵而來　華股腳地堅定</h3>
<p>華股昨環境雖吿不利，銀根又復奇緊，但有一部份開始出貨易股，以致幾經掙扎，卒能以穩健之象結束，前途業已有利。</p>
<p>晨開時即因週末業外大回，而塲外已先喊低，永紗開四九五〇元低盤，被進至五一七〇元，旋降爲五〇七〇元，代辦費開低爲七六元及八二元，升至五二三〇元。銀根奇緊，一〇六號一二九號等紛紛脫手，中途雖有小掙扎，仍退至五〇三〇元，港電報縮爲一角三，近午田一九七號等吸納，抬高至五二四〇元收市，較上週六計美亞改做小股後，軋升不少，中興漲一成，麗安新股漲停板，永紗信和華嫂永公火柴五和新華微降，餘均跌半成迄一成不等。</p>
<p>後市永紗上塲五三五〇元，銀根奇緊，一六四號一六〇號等脫手，退至五〇九〇元，八九號七六號等均進，國行差進不多，臨收抬高至五三五〇元，收市被賣至五三一〇元，美亞獨以漲停板結束。較晨收計中法尙平，麗安仍站漲限，內衣火柴小挫恒豐升半成，餘均微升，塲外各未上市股票升降互見。</p>
<p>外股昨失去圈外襯托，存多湧出，下瀉不少，散戶雖進，證券帮急於脫手，怡紗晨開一一七〇萬，自一一三〇萬起，因港電回小，近午升爲一二〇〇萬，但最後仍遭銀根所威脅，退至一一〇〇萬關口結束。較上週六計業廣尙平，會德豐低半成，怡紗英聯跌成半，餘股回小二成。</p>
<p>公債昨被銀根所迫低，成交不過三百萬。丙種晨開六二萬，低至五五萬而後稍穩，較上週六計甲乙丁跌五萬元，統丙低八萬元，戊種亦小七萬元。</p>
<h3>港銀行龐大存款數　穗金融界表示懷疑</h3>
<p>〔本報廣州二十八日電〕此間金融界人士，對路透社南京二十五日電所載，「我游資流入香港約達六百億港元，港華人在銀行存款逾千萬港幣者逾千戶，五百萬港幣者一萬戶，存港幣百萬以上者不可計數」，均深表懷疑，難以置信。蓋六〇〇億港元幾値美金一百二十億元，且該社稱此僅爲存款於銀行之數字，未存而流入港者未計。中國流港之游資恐米有若是之「豐富」，且依該社華人在港存款佔計當可達千億港元，或美金二〇〇億，使港銀行發行數字亦遠不可及，故僉認此消息，除足使我市塲加深刺激，再促成游資加緊投港外，爲完全不確。</p>
<h3>結匯證明書　手續費提高</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕本市指定銀行頃決議，結匯證明書手續費，原定爲每一美金兩萬元，自昨日起提高爲二萬五千元。結匯證明書之市價，昨日仍見上揚，晨開一百五十萬時，無人肯脫手，至一百七十萬時始有交易，至一百八十萬時大量買進，最高售價曾至一百八十五萬元。</p>
<h3>各地商情</h3>
<p>無錫</p>
<p>〔本報無錫廿八日電〕銀根奇緊，人心不振，套息乏利，各物一瀉千里。白粳一千六百卅九萬，白元一千五百九十七萬，埠秈一千五百七十萬，羊秈一千五百六十二萬，小麥一千〇七十萬，白麥一千〇九十萬，麵粉四百六十萬，荳油三千六百萬，棉紗六億三千萬，</p>
<p>鎮江</p>
<p>〔本報鎭江廿八日電〕鎭物價今全面回跌，糧市亦漸復常態，次熟米開一八〇〇萬，豆油大挫，今後市每百斤開價四六〇〇萬，較昨晨跌落一千萬，香烟約跌二成，紗布均降。</p>
<p>蘇州</p>
<p>〔本報蘇州廿八日電〕蘇州今日米價勢星盤旋，市塲做開上糙粳一四五〇萬元，上白粳一六五〇萬元，門售白米一七〇〇萬元，係以次白米充數，黑市上白米購求不易，價須在二千萬元左右。</p>
<p>常熟</p>
<p>〔本禺常熟廿八日電〕今日銀根奇緊，物價展開跌風，計開上白米一六八〇萬，白粳議價一五八〇萬，小麥一一三零萬，菜子一四〇〇萬，特號粉五三〇萬，棉紗仍無市，惟火油猛昇一百萬，納胃不暢。</p>
<h3>當局規定限價　米市交易仍停頓　昨麺粉做開價格略小</h3>
<p>食米·食油·雜糧·市塲十，因社局硬性規定，不得超越上星期五之收市價，惟照一般預測，價必超越，致交易仍無法展開。米市塲揗客被掘棄門外，致交易無法活動。塲內民調會仍拋米六千石，價格照舊，以人心而說，市勢略見疲軟，惟門售價格仍站高峯，白粳·薄稻·二千萬，早稱一千九百五十萬。食油雖由當局令廠商按限價開售，至收市時尙無下文。雜糧均因當局限制過嚴，未能開出。</p>
<p>麵粉亦同樣限上週五之價，爲五百萬，惟老車及兵船無貨應市，外埠雜牌粉因受查倉庫之故，國戶出籠，燈塔·地球·順風等一律爲四百九十八萬元，約有四五千包，惟呈粥少僧多之狀，麩皮三百九十萬限價略有交易，小麥廠盤下午開出爲六百七十萬元</p>
<h3>多頭出籠人心虛軟　紗價略見下挫</h3>
<p>經警監視布疋買賣不旺</p>
<p>昨日棉紗市况，因業外游資吿斷，六底結賬將屆，市上銀根趨緊，客銷轉淸，更以當局澈查倉庫，棧單均須登記，人心虛軟，多頭紛紛出籠，四十二支藍鳳細紗初開尙堅，後以市氣無神，交易甚稀，卒以八億八千萬元結束，比週末再降二千萬元。廿一支雙馬亦小一千萬元，爲七千億元，其餘各支粗細紗，市呈全面疲軟，普挫一成左右。</p>
<p>昨日棉布市况，因經警嚴密監視交易，市氣已見受挫，行情表面尙平，惟原棉廣乏未解，廠商成本日高，買賣袖手觀望，交易轉稀。龍頭細布及四君子元蜌嘰，交易仍不開做，此外五福細布上揚至二千一百五十萬元午收，較週五軋升二百五十萬元。龍頭B字及紅五福細布，亦好一百六十萬至一百八十萬元，其餘金蓮妙舞及雷峰塔元嗶嘰，成交甚多，價亦挺秀異常。至粗布漂布及士林布色布等，亦秀利逾恒。塲外龍頭細布喊價紊亂，自二千二百五十萬至六百萬均有成交。</p>
<h3>茶市原盤徘徊</h3>
<p>紅綠茶花色，自連續飛晋以來，昨日市上，大勢漸趨穩定·揆厥原因，居奇高扳者雖不乏人，但以六底關係，一般頻受銀根束縛，而前來吐售者亦屬不少，是以過程大有再好無力之象。臨收結果，遂吿原途盤旋。價格方面，較上週未見參差，而交易則除出口商對於外銷茶，依然畏高，胃納梗塞外，他若內銷花色，本街與鄉莊帮咸圖抑價進取，是以活動之意，動而乏勁，做開均猶狹隘。</p>
<h3>糧食部公佈新訂　糧食押匯押款辦法</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕糧食部以前訂辦理糧食押匯押款原則及辦法施行將近一年，迭據各方報吿，以原定辦法手續過繁，糧商不願申貸，因此未着成效，並將辦理手續，加以簡化，以利推行。遂經糧食部參酌各項意見，將原訂原則及實施辦法，修訂爲辦理糧食押款押匯辦法，函徵四聯總處同意，嗣經四聯總處第三六五次理事會決議，准照修正案通過，並將原訂原則及實施辦法廢止，四聯總處除函復糧食部外，並分電國家行局查照。茲將修正辦理糧食押款押匯辦法錄列於後：</p>
<p>（一）糧食部爲促進糧食流通，調節盈虛，充裕糧食存底起見，特商同四聯總處訂定本辦法。</p>
<p>（二）申請辦理糧食押款押匯之糧商，須具有下列各項資格。</p>
<p>一·依照糧商登記規則登記合格，領有糧食部頒之糧商營業執照，經營採購運銷業務之糧商。</p>
<p>二·當地糧食業同業公會會員。</p>
<p>三·具有充裕資本卓著信用者。</p>
<p>（三）各地糧商申請辦理押款時，應由當地糧政主管機關會同四聯分處或其指定銀行及其他有關機關，就當地糧食供需情形，購運糧食計劃，速同押款押匯額度，分別陳報糧食部及四聯總處核定辦理。</p>
<p>（四）糧商以購存糧食向國家行局辦理押款，該項作押糧食所存倉庫，應由銀行檢查認可。</p>
<p>（五）各地糧商辦理糧食押款押匯時所有一切押款手續担保事項期限及利息等，均應依照各該地承辦國家行局之規定辦理，（必要時得查酌實際情形，簡化手續，减低利息，延長期限及放寬押款押匯成數。）。</p>

<h3>中菲有具體商定　首屆亞洲運動會　菲主在我國舉行　草成備忘錄携往倫敦商討　郝更生報告南行經過</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕七屆全運在滬舉行時，海外僑胞返國參加，空前熱烈，充份表現愛護祖國熱忱。全運期間，中華全國體育協進會理事會復有推動發起舉行亞洲運動會之決議。新任中華全國體協總幹事郝更生乃有南洋之行，於本月八日出發，首赴馬尼拉，逗留九日，再轉赴新加坡，亦作五日之勾留，業於廿七日下午返滬，此行二十日，結果甚爲滿意。郝氏昨日下午三時，假座市體育館招待各報記者，報告此行經過如下：</p>
<p>郝氏稱：此次出國其動機有三：（一）七屆全運舉行時，僑胞返國參加，不但情緒熱烈，而各領隊尤希望郝氏能赴南洋巡視一番，故會後即決定一行，以資慰問，兼示答謝。中華全國體協會改組後初選江良規任總幹事，嗣江辭職，經重選郝氏爲總幹事，江爲副總幹事，乃益感有赴各該地考察之必要。（二）具有歷史性之遠東運動會，於民廿三年因日本堅決主張「滿洲國」參加而告解體後，至今已十四年，深感有重組亞洲體育會之必要，是以擬乘機與各方接洽。（三）參加世運經費政府僅撥二萬五千美金，不足之數，王正廷博士囑其代表向僑胞方面洽商，如有自動捐助，可補貼世運經費。</p>
<p>此次所至各地，均受僑胞熱烈歡迎，蓋僑生同胞返國參加全運後，對祖國之偉大，深受感動，故有此熱情之流露。至對組織亞洲體育會事，曾與陳堂壽二人，與菲方菲體協會總幹事伊蘭納，及菲馬尼拉大學體育主任一度會議，對於成立亞洲體育會及舉行亞洲運動會，雙方對原則完全同意，體育會議，每二年舉行一次，運動會每四年舉行一次，與世運會相間舉行。菲方並主張首次運動會應在我國舉行。會議經過，已由伊蘭納草成備忘錄，將携往倫敦，與參加世運之亞洲各國代表商討後，再定具體辦法。外傳爲遠東運動會之恢復，及中菲先舉行運動會之說，完全訛傳。屆時亞洲蘇聯當歡迎其參加，日本則待和會後國際承認其政府，再邀其參加。又馬尼拉新加坡及印尼華僑，對世運自動捐款，極爲踴躍，總計可有二萬五千至三萬五千美金之數，將直接自各該地匯至英倫，轉交世運代表團云。</p>

<p>體運在友聯以十一比四勝主隊，馬景耀與惠特之第四對，以二比一勝福瑪格列與史本脫，此爲友聯唯一之勝利。</p>

<h3>陳金德金置　不出席世運</h3>
<p>關於菲僑陳金德金置昆仲能否參加我世運監理隊一事，昨據郝更生對記者談，渠在菲時，獲悉菲方對此毫無意見，惟陳氏尊翁過慮殊多，爲避免無謂糾葛起見，不允彼倆代表我出席，且與其學業亦有關係云。</p>
<h3>世運足球隊　大勝馬來聯隊</h3>
<p>〔聯合社新加坡廿七日電〕中國世運足球隊，今日以三對零大勝馬來聯隊，觀衆兩萬五千人，中國隊合作與傳球美妙之極，馬來隊則缺乏聯絡。開賽後十五分鐘，中國隊朱永强用頭頂進一球，下半時朱永强乘敵不備，盤進一球，一分鐘後鄒文治又進一球，奠定勝局。</p>

<h3>懷黑德評杜威</h3>
<p>— 立人</p>
<p>不久以前逝世的英哲懷黑德教授（Prof．A．N．Whitehead）曾有一篇批評美哲杜威（John　Dewey）的文章，這篇文章首先是發表在美國西北大學主編的「生存哲人籌書」中的「杜威哲學」一書內，後來又收進懷氏的「科學與哲學諭文集」中。文章的題目是：「杜成及其影響」（John　Dewey　And　His　Influence。篇幅很短，寥寥不到千字，却把杜成在哲學史上的地位說明了，所以値得我們加以介紹。以下即簡述懷氏的原文。</p>
<p>懷氏認爲哲學是一種廣泛而界說不明的紀律，對於人性的長成却曾有許多貢獻。杜威在哲學史上的地位是可以放在那些曾把哲學思想造成爲適合時代需要的一羣人中。仙可以和古代的斯多噶派，和奧古斯丁，和阿葵那斯，和培根，和笛卡兒，和洛克及和孔德諸人並駕。這些人的名譽，不主要的因爲他們的特殊學說之爲後人所喜。他們的名譽乃在，由於他們活動的結果，他們時代上的社會系統，獲得了一種開明的動力，而使這些系統較充分的達到了可能的崇高目的。由於斯多噶派，然後西方國家的法律傳統可在羅馬帝國內鞏固的建立起來。由於奧古斯丁，然後西方基督教能以固定的理知傳統應付所謂黑暗時代。由於阿葵那斯，然後替甲世紀把行動，情感，和理解的調和的理想現代化。至培根，笛卡兒，洛克和孔德對於現代生活的影響，則更不待論。一樣的，杜威之於美國文明也盡了和上述誡人相同的貢獻。他曾把和社會系統之運用有關的偉大觀念表現了。他的成就的廣大是得以未來爲根據去佔計的。從今以後的許多年代中，北美洲都將爲人類文明的生動中心。思想和行動由之而來，亦以之爲據。我們都生活在杜威所影響的時代中。我們不能在這一時代之外來觀察這一時代，所以對這一時代的說明是困難的。不過，我們知道杜威是特殊有力的美國思想家。他是主要的理知力量，而以一致　目的供给其環境的。凡明顯的覺到杜威的影響的所在，他的人格是被人帶着感謝和眷愛的心情記憶着的。</p>
<p>懷氏雖把杜威的地位看得很高，可是他並不認爲杜威的思想是終極的，是完全的，是沒有疑問的。他認爲任何思想系統都不是終極的，完全的。把現存思想或知識視爲終極而完全的能度，乃是人類的武斷態度。懷疑者和信仰者，一樣是武斷主義者。目前主要的武斷主義者是科學家和懷疑者。他們可允許微末的進步，而根本的新奇却被阻碍了。這種武斷的常識實爲哲學探究的死亡。我們應知宇宙無窮，而人力有限。杜威是永不爲新奇的觀念所嚇倒的。不過，一切有地位的思想系統都免不了採取一種自行辯護的能度，都免不了要駁斥他人的學說，杜威不能例外。在哲學討論上，駁斥或批評自有合法的地位。惟駁斥或批評永不能成爲哲學上最後的一章。哲學是由引進新觀念，擴大眼光，及調和衝突，而逐漸進步的。這些話等於說，我們不能過份相信杜威的學說，不能因信仰杜威的學說，而武斷的拒絕新觀念。這不是促使也學進步之道。此外，懷氏認爲杜威的成功，在把和現代文明有關的概念表露，然其危險則在可把思想偏促於今日狹隘的範圍中。這種危險且因現代利學的威功而增加。我們不能僅以流行的概念的成功而滿足。思想有超出流行概念的必要。這就是懷氏所謂：「觀念的冒險」。一言以蔽之，懷氏是帶着警吿的能度去推尊杜威的。</p>
<h3>湖上閒思（五）</h3>
<p>— 孤鷗</p>
<p>陰陽</p>
<p>陰陽是兩對立同時並起的，若必加分別，則應該陰先陽後。讓我們把男女兩性來講，男女異性自然是兩相對立問時並起的，但照生物進化大例言，當其沒有雌雄男女之別以前，即以單細胞下等生物而言，生育機能早已具有，生育是女性的特徵，可見生物先有女性，逐步演化，再有男性，從女性中分出。女性屬陰，男性屬陽，故說陰先陽後。</p>
<p>再言之、從無生命的物質中演化出生命物質屬陰，生命屬陽，此六陰先陽後，若論死生，應該先有死，後有生，死不僅是生命之消散，同時也還是生命之未完成，生由死出而復歸於死，如是則仍是陰先陽後。</p>
<p>老莊言，天地萬物生於有，有出於無而還歸於無，生命來自物質，又歸入物質文化出於自然，又復歸於自然，一切如此，若用中國陰陽觀念言，應云陽出於陰而復歸於陰。陰陽序列不僅是先後的問題，乃是陽依附於陰而存在。沒有陽之前可以先有陰。沒有陽之後還可以仍有陰，若陰沒有了，陽亦絕不能再有。</p>
<p>易經以乾坤兩卦代表陰陽，乾德爲健，坤德爲順。健是動，順也不就是靜其實順還是動，以是健屬主動，順屬隨動。何以不說被動而云隨動，因被動是甲物被乙物推動，隨動是甲物隨順乙物而自動，主動和隨動一樣是自動，只是一先一後之間，至於被動則並非自動，只是他動而已，今論自然界徹首徹尾，只該有順動，不見有主動。或可說只有自動。沒有主宰此動或生出此動之另一動。甲順隨乙，乙又順隨丙，丙順隨丁，丁順隨戊，如是以至無限無極，相互牽連，相互推排，找不出一個起點，尋不出一個主腦。一切順隨，一切無自性。換言之，却即是一切自然。若你要在自然界硬尋主腦，硬定起點，那便是宗教家上帝創世論的一套，你將再也跳不出他的圈子，否則自然只是自然，隨動只是隨動，一個挨一個，一層挨一層，沒有頭，沒有腦，此之謂無極。無極是前無起，後無止，誰也主張不下誰，如是則一切隨動等於不動，因此以謂之靜。中國道家看準了這一點，所以六十四卦始於歸藏。萬物原始於坤，復歸藏於坤，歸藏是最終極的，同時又是最原始的。但你若名坤卦爲原始卦，則又教人想到一切動作有一個最先的開始，若有一個最先的開始，則此一動作決非隨動而必是生動了。則請問主此動者緊誰。自然界實不該有主動，一切動作皆是隨動，故通家不稱坤卦爲原始，而稱之日歸。而且歸藏也並不是消滅威完了。有人想，由物質界演出生命，由生命界演出人類，由人類演出文化，似乎逐步演展，永無止境，不知一切展演，到底還是回歸自然。一步也前不得。道家暢闡此義，故名坤卦曰歸藏。而定爲六十四卦之第一卦。儒家不主自然而推尊人文，就人言人，人類由自然界生命界動物界展演而來，又由人類展演出高深的文化。人文所與自然不同者，最主要的便是他有一個主動，由自然展演而爲人文，即是由隨動展演而出主動，試再舉男女兩性言之，在單細胞生物沒有分別雌雄男女以前，生物界只有生生不息而巳，此一種生命意志之生生不息，永永向前，實在已有了一點主動的精神，侵入了自然界隨動的範圍。應該說是從自然界隨動的範圍內積久蘊釀而產出此一點主動的精神。但那種生生不息，永永向前的一點生動精神，到底不鮮明，不健旺，還是隨動意味多，主動意味少。換言之，還是不脫自然姿態。自從雌性中分出雄性，女性中分出男性，男性雄性是代表更主動的。而雌性女性則只代表更隨順的。由有雄性男性而生活意志之主動形式更鮮明更健吒更强烈。這是生命界一大進化。我們不妨說，自然界以順動爲特徵，人文界以主動爲特徵，人文演進之大例即在爭取主動。儒家就人論人，故取乾卦爲第一卦，就自然界言，是陰先於陽，就人文界言，應該陽先於陰，爭取主動來支配自然界的一切隨動。但人文主動，本亦從自然隨動中演出，而且他自有一個極限，最後歸宿仍必加入自然。此層儒家深知之，故乾卦六爻，初爻潛龍勿用，上爻兀龍有悔，又說羣龍無首吉，這些都是要在爭取生動中間仍不違背了順動之大法。在創進文化大道上，要依然不遠離了自然則律。若苟子所謂的觔天主義，實非儒家精神。</p>
<p>陰陽又代表人世問的君子與小人。依照上述理論，君子從小人中間產出，他還依附小人而存在，而且最後仍須回歸於小人。猶臀如從自然中產生文化，文化依然要回歸自然。所以小人可以起意來反對君子，君子却始終存心領導小人，決不反對小人。小人可以起意來殘害君子，君子却始終存心護養小人，決不殘害小人。從小人中間產出君子，再淺臂之，猶如樹上開花，樹可以不要花，花不能不要樹。自然可以不要文化，文化不能不要自然。同樣，自然可以毀滅文化，文化斷不能毀滅自然。但人文主義者，則仍自以文化為重，君子爲責。</p>
<h3>臺灣大觀發電廠之水管工程</h3>
<h3>學林樷話（廿八）</h3>
<p>— 張其昀</p>
<p>論人物</p>
<p>英人羅素以爲一代才智之士對於當時社曾之態度，大致可分三派，一曰建設派，一日激烈派，一日悲觀派。建設派是造歷史的人物，視人爲社會一分子，深信欲增進個人的利益，莫如致力於公共的幸福。他們富於創業精神，以世事大有可爲，充滿樂觀積極的心情。者求他們所以成功的要素，在於能够知古知今，以理性爲指針，而應用之於各種實際問題。所究古人學說，非崇拜亦非菲薄，而爲一種瞭解的同情，是即所謂批評精神。古人所得任何問題之答案，決非究全無缺永久不變者，對於古人的議論務當研究其何以似若眞理。知占之說如此。大凡首倡一種新觀念的人，往往與時代相距太遠，並世之人視爲愚昧，故其人多不知名，而不久爲人所遺忘。其後時機成熟，有穎脫而出者，歷史上以新思想知名的大人物，往往是脫胎於前人的第二手。但其偉大之處，正在其能認識時代，偵所播種子得以開花結實。知今之說如此。美國的新政，（New　Dea）英國的工黨，孫中山與甘地都屬於這一派。</p>
<p>激烈派又分二派，一爲浪漫運動，一爲惟物史觀。浪漫運動偏重情感，趨於極端，羅素以爲感情淮露而易致，理知深沈而難能。感情獨來獨往，理知必須與人共之。感情只顧目前，理性必須計及未來。浪漫運動發于盧騷，由今觀之，盧騷之說貌似倡導民治，實則多爲極權國家張目。羅素於尼采之說尤痛斥其非，謂在尼采觀之，林肯卑下而拿破侖偉大。彼等心目中只有普遍的仇恨與恐懼，而無普遍的同情與愛，不知世界之所由立，在于仁愛。尼采學說可謂此路不通，納粹德國之覆亡即其明證。羅素杜威都曾遊歷蘇俄，他們都不贊成馬克思的歷史惟物觀，謂其近於神學，不贊成暴力革命，謂將流於獨栽。</p>
<p>非觀觀派對現實世界失望其深，又無挽回世運的自信心，徬徨無所宗主，恐懼之念多於希望，既以改革爲不可能，不欲積極行善，但願逃避禍患，獨善其身。厭世思想又可分爲四派，曰抗議派，懷疑派，放達派，苦行派。抗議派憤世嫉俗，貶斥一切，以爲世事一無當意者，終至於麻木不仁，不問不聞。懷疑派爲懶人之自慰，以無知爲知，隨俗浮沉，一無建樹。放達派自以爲有戲者比做戲者爲高尙，高蹈遠引，自尋樂趣，其弊爲不識時務，淸淡亡國。苦行派抑制一切情感，心如槁木死灰，祗得失如浮雲。以上各派有其共同之點，即爲個人主義與命定主義，其結果坐視破壞而不知建設。悲觀思想並非前導的炬火，而爲轍後的餘燼，這是亂世的病態。東西洋的大哲無不持樂觀積極的態度，以建國淑世為已任。</p>
<h3>亞里士多德　論潛能與現實</h3>
<p>— 自強</p>
<p>亞里士多德一方面承認有所謂形式與質料（Form　andmatter），一方面又主張形式和質料都在個物之中，所以他必須想出法子把它們搭得起來，這個法子就是他所發見的潛能與現實（Potentiality　and　actualety）的原理。他以爲，個物之所以形成，只是質料由潛能到現實的一種作用，第一條件是質料與形式，第二條件是一個動的原理，潛能與現實便是。</p>
<p>單有形式不算存在，只是質料也不算存在，必得形式實見於質料上才算存在；原理不能獨在，事實不能徒存，原理必須有事實做印證，事實必須有原理來貫穿，才有存在之可言，同時才是知識—學問—的對象。但是形式如何實見於質料上？事實如何印證原理，原理如何貫穿事實？說到這裏，潛能與現實的功用來了。由潛能到現實這歷程是個積極的發展。非但是積極的發展，同時也是目的上（Teleological）的發展。怎麼說呢？潛是潛伏，能是可能，旣有潛伏的可能性，那麼所差的只是個現實。個物形成之先，已具將來所要成的趨勢，將來所要成的就是目的，現實的作用只是把這趨勢促其實現。質料之中本有所要形成某種個物的潛能，由此潛能到　現實乃是必經的路，因爲事前就有一個預定的目的在那裏了。</p>
<p>亞氏的學說，從靜的方而看，個物等於存在，道一點是絕大的關鍵，再從動的方面看，潛能與現實的原理也是絕大的關鍵。例如形而上學方面，整個的存在—宇宙—便是無數的個物由潛能到現實所形成的；在物理學方而，各現象也是潛能到現實的表見；在心理學方面，人格就是生理，心理，等狀態由潛能發展到現實的結果；如比類推，潛能與現實的原理無有行不通的。</p>
<p>亞氏的潛能與現實的原理，乍看似乎和近世進化論的原理一樣，其實大不相同：（一）亞氏所謂潛能到現實的進化是有預定的目的的，進化論的進化不講目的，換句話說，不抱哲學上的目的觀，卻帶點科學上的機械觀。（二）亞氏听謂進化只有個物的進化，沒有種類的進化。例如由精蟲到細胞，由細胞到小猿，由小猿到大猿，這幾個階段是亞氏的潛能與現實的原理之下所容許的進化，至於由猿到人這種類的進化是亞氏所不許，卻是進化論所謂進化；換句話說，亞氏的進化只是一事一物臻於至當最宜之境的意思，由猿變成人就不是猇所應當到的境界，所以在他視爲畸形的發展，反常的狀態。（三）希臘哲學從蘇格拉底以後，論理成了中心的問題，亞氏本想擺脫這範圍，但於不知不覺之中很受它的拘束，就論潛能與現實以原理，也還脫不掉它。潛能的境界是質料，現實的境界是形式，形式是質料所趣向的目的，這目的是至當，最宜，極完備，極美滿，的標準，—這樣，便帶着倫理的氣味了。進化論的進化之由一階段進到另一階段，所謂另一階段也者，並不是前一階段的目的，更沒有倫理的氣味，換句話說，無所謂至當，最宜，極完備，極美滿，的目標。</p>

<h3>論節約</h3>
<p>— 吳庸</p>
<p>富者樻財不用，則貧者無以爲生。</p>
<p>此語不錯。比方跳舞使關少爺化一點錢，俾舞女得以糊口，尙不失爲融通經濟之道。</p>
<p>因此有人推論：凡事愈浪費愈佳，謂浪費有平均財富之功，救濟失業之效。實則財富之平均，失業之救濟，若有賴於浪費之手段纔能促成，仔細思之，其事至可悲哀。</p>
<p>美國羅斯福總統施行新經濟時代，政府爲救濟失業工人之痛苦，不惜多方設計不必要之建築工程，悉力以赴。殊不知工人痛苦之所在，在於沒有收入，初不在於無工可做。如旨在解救工人之痛苦，則逕以金錢授工人就是，何必開建不必要之工程，旣傷財，又勞民？工人若怕無工可做，儘可將室外斷磚碎石搬諸室內，如嫌不足，更不妨以之搬至樓上，然後再移諸棋下，搬到室外，反復搬移，效陶侃之所爲。</p>
<p>解決失業問題，其道決不可賴浪費，於無中生有，橫添些職位出來。「勞作一並不是擁資者所能賜予勞工的最好之禮物。苦力胼手胝足，日晒雨打，其本身殊非賞心樂事。在今日文明世紀，這類苦力促其减少，才是正理。</p>
<p>勞作本身決非人生之理想鵠的；浪費更不能有益於國計民生。浪費論者的話若是眞理，則推諸極端，我們就應該盡力從事於破壞，蓋本先有破壞而後有建設」之義，必先去做破壞工作，然後大家才可熙熙攘攘，有工做，有飯吃。準此，匪徒是警察之恩人；沒有盜匪歹人，設了警察何用？名　交際花生活業費，羞爲人見其一襲衣服穿上二次，此輩該是扶植一國生產之功臣。推而廣之，室內窗戶玻璃，我們不妨盡量予以擊碎，打得一方不剩，這樣玻璃廠商便可不致關門，營業鼎盛之餘，工廠擴充，工人加添，失業减少，生產大增；其建築新廠，購置新器材，影響所及，當能繁榮他業，促使全國工業化。準此而言，健康的人必促使其生病，生病的人必促使其早死，然後業醫者生涯興隆，業壽器者門庭若市了。</p>
<p>所奇的是：主張這樣的浪費論者，往往同時亦即是在他方面竭力主張節約的人。今日有些人對於教育文化事業，開口便是經費拮据，力謀撙節，於是於大規模的浪費塲面之下，教育文化事業便最先遭受「節約」之災。鄙意縱使決意努力於浪費，亦宜平均發展，各方面都來大規模的浪贊一下，包括教育文化事業在內，這樣倒要好些。今日局面令人覺得：宜節約的事是在極力浪費，應該不惜浪費的事倒是最先被節約。時無論古今，地無論中外，於浪費聲中，好的事總是最先被去掉的。</p>
<p>向之極權國家爲謀解決國內的失業與不滿，不惜發動對外侵略戰爭以轉移人民視綫。這類事例，初看好笑，繼而不免令人擲筆浩歎。</p>
<h3>南北天氣</h3>
<p>— 孜孜</p>
<p>民國初年，保定軍官學校中有兩同學，極友善，一姓薛，河北人，一姓婁，江南人。兩人居同室，食同桌，同遊共憇，形影不離。如是者數年，畢業之日，互以盡忠報國相期許，並預約此後二者中若有一人發達，則必當盡力提拔另一人；遂分道揚鑣，婁南下江蘇，薛則仍在河北謀發展。未　，婁飛黃騰達，屢告晋升，又未幾而竟至於旅長，煊赫一時；薛則潦倒不堪，乃束裝南下，以求謀得一官半職。旣達南京，婁親出迎接，招待殷勤，每餐必親自奉陪，視若上賓，唯漫不與論謀職任事。薛屢次探詢，皆遭拒絕。一日，婁遺人遞上一字條日：「江南日暖雖積雪」，蓋當時適値初春，江南冬雪漸融，而「雪」與「薛」諧音，此謂江南無法爲之安插也。薛見字大怒，不別而行，返河北投軍，努力苦幹，大有成就，未期年，一路順風，儼然一代名將矣。唯「長江後浪推前浪」，婁則以長官失勢，漸趨沒落，幾不能維持衣食。無奈，乃輾轉北上，登薛門請予接濟。薛亦以上賓之禮待之，日食以美味，居以華室，極盡富貴榮華之能事，絕不稍拂其意，唯亦從不與論及謀職之事。婁雖豐衣足食，奈飽食終日，無所用心，况爲武人，性情好動，日久遂益不耐，見無動靜，憤然辭去。薛亦不堅留，設盛筵爲之餞行，婁臨行始詢以北方有無可安插之地位。薛但吿日：「弟日前叨擾貴府，復蒙盛情款待，衷心實感不安；足下所擬上聯，弟日久無以為對，唯今日忽得下聯，願兄教之。」其下聯則「塞北風高不住樓」也，婁大慚而去。</p>
<h3>浪淘沙</h3>
<p>— 陳蒙庵</p>
<p>江邊原是售江心，前浪還同後浪沈，風急不隨泥汨沒，伴他鷗鷺候睛陰。</p>
<p>潮長浪隨風力增，沙平夜永月初升，盈虛原不關人事，無奈人心終不寗。</p>
<p>江海　來一樣深，有人煮鹵復淘金，無情更比多情苦，勞碌千年直到今！</p>
<p>暮暮朝朝春又秋，沙無增减水長流，不堪鷗鳥分新舊，還有趁潮來往舟。</p>
<p>旣向東流又向西，一時高漲一時低，痴心會有停流日，轉眼紅桑意總迷。</p>
<p>新翻舊譜說當時，傳到而今若箇知？再向他年歌此曲，不成又是古人辭！</p>
<p>楊柳枝，浪淘沙，皆唐人樂府辭，尊前瞟唱，其節奏已不可復按。劉白所譜，純乎唐音，皆七言詩也。至花閒所收，則不能不謂之詞矣。然劉白之不能謂詞，與花閒諸作不能謂之詩，此中消息，政復可參。</p>
<h3>「人心大快」</h3>
<p>— 平齋</p>
<p>每讀報紙紀載罪犯執行槍決的新聞，往往可以在描寫趴行情形的一節中發現兩句套語，呌做「人心大快，爭聲雷動」。有時不免就想，一個活生生的人，綁了起來跪在地上打哆嗦，突然身後砰然一響，於是就「一槍畢命，倒臥血泊中」了；社會執行了以「殺人者死」的精神制定的法律——但是目覩的人却竟然會得采聲雷動，却實在有些像狄更斯筆下圍着斷頭合喝采的羣衆。我想這種心理是不大健康的。</p>
<p>昨天旁晚，我帶了我的孩子到北四川路閒逛，忽然看見人行道上擠了一圈人，而且愈擠愈多了。走近看時，却看見一個滿頭大汗穿着汗衫短袴的大孩子，年紀至多才十七八歲罷，像是小飯館裏的一個學徒。他發現自己已經成爲許多人注意的對象，不禁得意洋洋地提起了他手裘的「法寳」——一隻七八寸長的大老鼠。那個靑年小心地把老鼠的尾巴用一根堅牢的麻綫縛緊，他手裏就提着這根麻綫。</p>
<p>他在笑着，看見有一輛汽車駛過，就立刻用力把那隻老鼠向汽車輸前拋過去，但那個駕駛汽車的紳士早就瞥見，眉頭一縐，車子「煞」了一下，那只老鼠趕快就帶着麻綫向旁邊逃。那個靑年的興趣似乎更濃厚了，他又高高提起了麻繩，吊得高高的老鼠的四只脚在空中亂抓。四週的觀衆更多了。</p>
<p>那時候，我牽了孩子的手趕快走了過去，剛走了十幾步，馬路上一連來了十幾部汽車。突然，我聽見後面有幾十個人呌好的聲音。老鼠的死刑已經執行過了</p>
<p>我想，「人心大快」和「采聲雷動」事實上恐怕就無非如此。大家實在太苦悶了，於是這一口怨氣便化爲無比的殘酷，以看殺人爲快舉，以虐待弱者爲能事！</p>
<p>蘇聯決定廢除死刑之後，英國政府也曾有立即廢除死刑的建議，當時蕭伯納等人還發表過種種反對廢除死刑的理由。但最近披閱電訊，英國倒底也決定先「試行」廢除死刑若干年了。而美國的司法界則傾全力於「治療」犯罪的工作上，犯罪被視爲一種病態，遠見的法官們正以人格和教育的力量，使罪犯能得到眞正「自新」的機會。「除暴」比「洗心革面」容易，但他們的「洗心革面」工作却獲得了可驚的成績。</p>
<p>我們呢？別的且不必說，「人心」却總是常常有「大快」的機會的。</p>
<h3>張三李四</h3>
<p>— 尤墨君</p>
<p>我們口頭所常說的一張三，李四」同於某甲，某乙，不過泛稱一般毫無關係的人而言，原無深義；至何以必稱「張」「李」二姓，則因這二姓最普通；何以必稱「三」「四」，無非言其閒雜，故更不必深究。</p>
<p>民國十九年秋執教杭州時，曾動觀蘆之興，特至西溪一走，取道留下鎭，乘船到西溪，操船的是一老嫗。據她吿我說，留下之所以稱爲「留下，因當洪楊之劫，其地殺戮至慘，微幸留存的，只有四姓十八家，所謂「張三」，「李四」，「王五」，「趙六」是；即張姓僅剩三家，李姓四家，王姓五家，趙姓六家，合成四姓十八家之數。友人說她是胡說，「張三李四」早見於五燈會元。我也說便是留下的名稱也是南宋初已有的，但聽聽這種野語也行呀！</p>
<p>五燈會元，手頭無這書，中不知作何語，當時亦未詳詢友人。按朱熹語類云：「如這衆人只是一個道理：有張三，有李四，李四可爲張三，張三可爲李四。一這可證「張三李四」云云在南末時已有此稱謂了。再推得遠些，則北宋時亦已有此稱人習慣，王安石且以之入詩。王詩有云：「張三袴口窄，李四帽簷長；莫言張三惡，莫愛李四好！」這詩倒頗通俗化。</p>
<p>根據上述，「張三李四」的說數有兩種，杭州留下老嫗所云自有別解。</p>
<h3>離婚理由</h3>
<p>— 晉霖</p>
<p>巴黎有一個女人因爲她那三十九歲的丈夫稚氣太重而要求離婚。理由是：「自從他們結婚以來，她的丈夫從來不曾送聖誕禮品給她，却堅持相信聖誕老人自已會送來的。」結果，法官批准了她的要求。</p>
<p>在美國卡里斯頓城，有一位十七歲的女子要求和她的十歲的丈夫離婚，理由是她那十歲的丈夫無力瞻養她。</p>
<p>在瑞士，一個又聾又啞的丈夫要求和他那又聲又啞的妻子離婚，理由是她故意裝作不懂他的手勢。</p>
<p>巴黎的一個男人要永離婚，法庭已予批准。因爲他的妻子寢室裏藏着十三尊像男人一樣大小的菩薩。</p>
<h3>編製中的中國新圖（二）</h3>
<p>— 方俊</p>
<p>舊圖廓之五萬分一圖所佔範團大致如下：</p>
<p>河北東部約爲全省之三分之二</p>
<p>河南　全省</p>
<p>山西　全省</p>
<p>山東　全省</p>
<p>陜西　中部約佔全省之六分之一</p>
<p>江蘇　全省</p>
<p>安徽　缺少中部</p>
<p>浙江　全省</p>
<p>湖北　全省</p>
<p>湖南　北部及湘江流域約佔全省之二分之一</p>
<p>江西　北部約佔全省二分之一</p>
<p>廣東　全省</p>
<p>四川　重慶以東長江流域約佔全省十分之一</p>
<p>雲南　東部及中部約佔全省三分之一</p>
<p>新圖廓皆以蘭勃脫分帶投影爲基礎。每幅東西佔經距十五分，南北緯距十分。經過三角測量之糾正，故圖幅齊整。非特此也，精度亦較舊圖廓爲高。吾人試以新測經緯點或實測之路綫岡繪入岡中，則各地位置以及河流之曲折，皆能與圖中各點一一吻合。其精確程度，與國際近代地形岡相較並無遜色。其所佔範圍爲：</p>
<p>甘肅　東部及西延至酒泉附近約佔全省之三分之一</p>
<p>陝西　西部十數幅</p>
<p>四川　成都以東約佔全省之五分之一</p>

<p>雲南　西部</p>
<p>廣西　缺少西部約佔全省半數以上</p>
<p>福建　缺少與江西交界區械佔全省之三分之二</p>
<p>次述新圖之編纂，擬分材料，編纂以及清繪三項申述如左：</p>
<p>我國測量局實測地形圖以五萬分一比例尺者爲主，按其性質約可分爲兩種，即所謂舊圖廓與新圖廓是也。前者施測時期在民國初年乃至抗戰軍興。圖幅不論地域概爲橫四十六公分，縱三十六公分，因此在南部各省每幅所佔之經距少，而在北方則所佔者多，約計之，每幅東西約佔經距十三分乃至十五分，緯距概爲十分左右。此種圖幅不以投影爲基礎，更無三角測量爲之控制，故圖幅位置參差不齊，必須加以整理，方能應用。美國軍用地圖供應處（ArmyMapService簡稱AMS）曾將我國歷年所測經緯度及各等三角測量之成果加以澈底之整理，以之爲骨幹，推算所有圖幅四角之經度。此項資料，至足珍貴。舍此，則編製時間至少須延長一年以上。申報出版現已發行</p>

<h3>Presidential Couple Return to Capital; Meet with Liu Maoen, etc. in Zhengzhou; National Flags Fly Over Kaifeng, City Returns to Normal</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 28th] President Chiang, having departed the capital on the 21st for an inspection tour, has now completed his duties. At approximately 7:00 PM on the 28th, he and his wife, along with their entourage, returned to the capital aboard the "Chung Cheng" special plane. The President wore a traditional Chinese robe and black mandarin jacket, while the First Lady was dressed in a navy blue Western suit. After the plane landed, the First Lady was the first to disembark, and Chiang Ching-kuo, the President's son, was at the airport to greet them. The President appeared to be in high spirits and immediately returned to his official residence to rest. The President departed Xi'an at 1:30 PM and arrived in Zhengzhou at 3:00 PM. He stayed in Zhengzhou for three hours, during which time he summoned the Chairman of Henan Province, Liu Maoen, and General Sun Zhen, whose troops, along with General Qiu Qingquan's, were among the first to enter Bian (Kaifeng), dividing their forces into two routes. He inquired in detail about the Battle of Kaifeng and then departed Zhengzhou for the capital by plane at 6:00 PM.</p>
<p>[Our Xi'an Dispatch, 28th] After a week's visit, the President and his wife departed by the "Chung Cheng" special plane for Zhengzhou en route to the capital on the afternoon of the 28th. Yu Chi-shih and more than 30 others accompanied them. The citizens of Xi'an were unable to see them off due to the rain and muddy conditions. Before his departure, the President summoned senior generals, including Zhang Zhizhong, Hu Zongnan, and Zhu Shaozhou, and gave them instructions. Ma Bufang and Ma Hongbin, among others, left here today to return to Lanzhou.</p>
<p>[Our Kaifeng Dispatch, 27th] Chairman Liu Maoen of Henan Province had a long conversation with our reporter by candlelight on the night of his entry into the city. He believes that the greatest crisis in Henan Province lies in the fact that local armed forces, without the government's timely cultivation, will ultimately be exploited by bandits who will use both soft and hard tactics, leading to a state of helplessness. Regarding the Central Plains war situation, he believes that the communists absolutely dare not cross the Yangtze River rashly. The government's countermeasures should focus on increasing troop strength and unified command.</p>
<p>Director Cao of the President's special inspection team, fourth group, flew to Bian from Zhengzhou today to express his condolences to Chairman Liu. General Qiu Qingquan, commander of the Fifth Army, and various division and brigade commanders also extended their condolences to Chairman Liu.</p>
<p>[Our Zhengzhou Dispatch, 27th] Although only two days have passed since the recapture of Kaifeng, everything is already returning to normal. After entering the city, Chairman Liu worked through the night with senior provincial officials to properly plan resettlement matters. Today, the citizens of the city are bustling and coming and going in droves, and most of the shops have also reopened. This afternoon, the reporter left Bian by plane for Zhengzhou. While circling over Kaifeng, he saw national flags flying all over the city under the sunlight, indicating that Kaifeng will move towards a new life in hardship from now on.</p>
<h3>Southern Advance by Longhai Road Troops; Conquer Sui County and Qi County in Succession; Fierce Battle for Suburbs of Yanzhou</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 28th] Various National Army units in eastern Henan are carrying out a comprehensive suppression in the Yellow River flood area. After capturing Chenliu on the afternoon of the 28th, another route captured Sui County at 3:00 PM. The pursuit troops intercepted a large quantity of supplies north of Tongxu at 6:00 PM. Chen Yi's communist troops have been pursued by the National Army to the vicinity of Tongxu, Weishi, and Xuchang, while a portion has fled to the vicinity of Luyi. The National Army on the southern section of the Pinghan Railway also began advancing north on the 27th and pressed on to Luohe on the 28th. Liu Bocheng's communist troops are also fleeing towards the vicinity of Xuchang.</p>
<p>[Our Xuzhou Dispatch, 28th] Various powerful troop formations of the National Army advancing south from the Longhai Railway yesterday successively recovered Sui County, Qi County, and two other towns, as well as important strongholds such as Yuxiangpu, Baimiao, Changgang, and Banpodian, killing more than ten thousand bandits. The remnants of Chen's various units are fleeing south in a sorry state, and the National Army is pursuing and encircling them.</p>
<p>[Our Xuzhou Dispatch, 28th] Fierce fighting continues in Yanzhou. The battle for the western pass and the eastern suburbs of the city is fierce, and the bandits have been repelled. The battle situation at the northern and southern passes is relatively calm, and the National Army is firmly defending its original positions.</p>
<p>[Our Jinan Dispatch, 28th] The battle for Yanzhou is becoming increasingly fierce. The National Army, which is advancing north from Teng County to support and reinforce Yanzhou, was still engaged in fierce fighting with the bandits north of the Jie River on the 27th. The National Army is making every effort to clear obstacles and advance north.</p>
<h3>Heroic Deeds During the Battle of Bian; Division Commander Li Zhongnian Commits Suicide for the Cause; Body Still Missing</h3>
<p>[Our Kaifeng Dispatch, 27th] The news that General Li Zhongnian, commander of the reorganized 66th Division, committed suicide for the cause during the defense of Kaifeng has been confirmed by our reporter's investigation. According to reports, Li personally led the 37th Regiment of the 13th Brigade of his division to supervise the battle at Longting in the northern city of Bian at the beginning of the war. After the fall of Bian, his whereabouts remained unknown. This morning, the reporter drove to the northern city to investigate and happened to meet Li's adjutant, Tan Shiying, who, after escaping from captivity, was collecting Li's belongings in the area. According to Tan, on the evening of the 21st, when the battle situation in Bian was on the verge of being unsalvageable, Li was seriously wounded but still led the remaining troops in the command post at Nengting to resist the attacking bandits. At 9:10 PM, the Longting stronghold could no longer be defended, and Tan carried Li to a certain bunker in the northern city to rest. However, the war became more and more intense, and the communist artillery fire intensified, fiercely attacking this remaining stronghold. General Li knew that the situation was hopeless. At 9:15 PM, he pointed the revolver he was carrying at his right temple and committed suicide with one shot. At that time, Tan was still standing by his side and was immediately captured. Li's body is still missing. At the place where Li died, the reporter only saw a pool of blood and Li's belt.</p>
<h3>Henan Provincial Security Department Counselor Xu Xiangjiu Escapes to Capital</h3>
<p>Reportedly, Liu Zhenhua, etc., Have Been Captured</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 28th] Xu Xiangjiu, Lieutenant General Counselor of the Henan Security Command, was ordered by Chairman Liu Maoen to serve as the supervisory officer in this defense of Kaifeng. After the fall of Kaifeng, he broke through the siege alone from Bian on the 22nd and arrived in the capital on the afternoon of the 28th. According to him, when the bandits attacking Bian broke into the Henan Provincial Government at about 12:00 midnight on the 20th of this month, Secretary Ma and Education Department Director Wang were captured. When Longting was captured by the bandits, Chairman Liu's eldest brother, Zhenhua, was captured.</p>
<h3>Wu Huawen Rewarded for Pacification Efforts; Promoted to Army Commander and Division Commander</h3>
<p>[Our Jinan Dispatch, 28th] Wang Yaowu, believing that Wu Huawen, commander of a reorganized division, had made great contributions to pacification, submitted a request to the highest authorities to promote Wu to army commander and division commander of a certain reorganized army. In addition, Fu Liping, the former Shandong Security Commander who recently returned from an inspection in the United States, has been appointed as the deputy commander of the local pacification zone.</p>
<h3>Presidential Order</h3>

<h3>Henan Refugee Senators Hold Talks in Capital</h3>
<p>Demand Thorough Investigation of Responsibility for Loss of Bian</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 28th] Henan provincial senators in the capital held a temporary meeting of refugee senators at the Beijing Municipal Council at 9:00 AM on the 28th. More than 40 senators attended, but as the number was insufficient to meet the legal quorum, a discussion was held instead, chaired by Vice Speaker Zhang Honglie. Resolutions were made: (1) Send a telegram to the Executive Yuan, the Control Yuan, and the Ministry of National Defense, demanding a thorough investigation of the responsibility for the loss of Kaifeng and the indiscriminate bombing by aircraft, and severely punish those responsible. Also, request an investigation to determine the meritorious generals and soldiers who died in defense of the city and provide appropriate compensation and commendation.

<h3>Executive Yuan Approves Government Employees to Draw Half-Month's Salary in Advance</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 28th] News from the Information Bureau of the Executive Yuan: The standard for the payment of living allowances for civil and military personnel is determined on a monthly basis according to the living index of the previous month. The salaries of civil and military personnel for July must be adjusted after the indexes of various regions for June have been collected. Recently, prices have risen sharply, and the lives of civil and military personnel in various regions have become more difficult. The Executive Yuan is deeply concerned about this and intends to allow all civil and military employees, soldiers, and police across the country to temporarily borrow half a month's salary at the June standard before the July salaries are adjusted.</p>
<h3>Review Committee of Control Yuan Presents Two Opinions</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch, Nanjing, 28th] The review committee formed by the Control Yuan on the Executive Yuan's reply to the corrective motion on price stabilization held a meeting at 8:00 PM on the 28th, presided over by convener Wang Guanwu. After discussion, two opinions were compiled and scheduled to be submitted to the general meeting on the 29th. If passed, the Executive Yuan will be urged again to take emergency and effective measures to deal with the soaring prices, and members will be dispatched to Beiping, Tianjin, and Shanghai to investigate and report. The two opinions are as follows: (1) The corrective motion of this Yuan was submitted on June 16. The main purpose of the original motion was to suggest that the Executive Yuan take emergency and effective measures to suppress the price increase, given that prices had risen sharply from the beginning to the middle of June. According to the reply, only a list of policy principles is given, and there is no explanation of the implementation or the results, especially the soaring prices in the most recent week (June 23 to 28), which shows that even if the Executive Yuan has taken measures, they have not been effective. Therefore, this Yuan should re-resolve this case and transfer it to the Executive Yuan to take emergency and effective measures as soon as possible to quickly stop the soaring prices. (2) The current soaring prices are clearly manipulated by artificial factors. This Yuan should send members to Beijing, Shanghai, and Tianjin to conduct a thorough investigation and report in order to suppress them. In addition, the Executive Yuan's measures and whether the personnel implementing them are performing poorly should be thoroughly investigated.</p>
<h3>Minister of Finance Studies Measures; Earnestly Stabilizes Prices</h3>
<p>Rumors of Wang Yunwu's Resignation are Inaccurate</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 28th] There have been rumors that Wang Yunwu resigned because he felt that prices could not be stabilized, but according to sources in the Ministry of Finance on the 28th, this information is completely inaccurate. Wang smiled and dismissed the news when he saw it in the newspaper on the 28th and told senior officials in the ministry that there was no such thing. It is also learned that Wang is studying effective measures to stabilize prices in response to the recent price increases.</p>
<h3>National Army in Eastern Hebei Enters Changli; Fighting Resumes in the Beiping-Tianjin-Baoding Triangle</h3>
<p>[Our Tianjin Dispatch, 28th] National Army troops in eastern Hebei have entered Changli on the 28th. The bandits are rapidly fleeing north, and the air force has followed up with bombing. However, the military has not yet confirmed this.</p>
<p>[Our Beiping Dispatch, 28th] The communist army on the Yongyu section continues to collapse north. Today's air force report states that the National Army is coordinating with the air force to pursue in separate groups. Today's east-bound train reached Jia Dian.</p>
<p>[Our Qinhuangdao Dispatch, 28th] The National Army in eastern Hebei is being attacked from both east and west. The western route has approached Changli, and the eastern route captured the Qiyun Temple highlands northeast of Beidaihe at 8:00 PM on the 27th. However, the threat to the National Army's garrison on Qin Island is still great, and the National Army is working hard to eliminate it. There was a fierce battle at Luwang Village northwest of Beidaihe on the 28th.</p>
<p>[Our Beiping Dispatch, 28th] After a long period of silence, fighting has resumed in the Beiping-Tianjin-Baoding triangle. Jiugang, Banjiawo, and Hugezhuang (all between Xiong County and Ba County) were once lost. On the 26th, local teams encountered more than 3,000 troops from the communist 7th Column. The bandits once broke into the southwest positions, but the National Army reinforcements arrived later and finally recovered Jiugang, Banjiawo, and Hugezhuang. The bandits retreated southeast.</p>
<h3>Current Situation is Indeed Critical; Let Us Work Together to Complete the Pacification; Bai Chongxi's Speech at Welcome Meeting in Hankou</h3>
<p>[Our Hankou Dispatch, 28th] The Wuhan community held a welcome meeting for Commander-in-Chief Bai this afternoon at 3:00 PM. He Chengjun, Zhang Dulun, Fang Juehui, and others delivered welcome speeches one after another, expressing their eagerness for the early success of the pacification. Bai then gave a speech, pointing out that the pure military suppression of bandits has failed. We cannot deny failure as victory. In the future, if we want to complete the great cause of pacification and national construction, the party, government, and military must all change their styles, start anew with the people, and thoroughly implement total war. We must use military force to cover politics and economy, to control manpower, control food, and control intelligence, to stabilize people's livelihoods and achieve "land to the tiller". Bai said: "The strategy of fighting for points and lines has fallen behind. We must strengthen overall control in response to the communist conspiracy." Finally, he pointed out that the Wuhan training work is only a formality and listed the effectiveness of military-civilian cooperation in eastern Hubei, appealing to the people of central and northern Hubei and other places to assist the National Army in jointly eliminating the remaining bandits. Bai said in a cautious tone: "The current situation is indeed critical and we are at the point of being besieged. We must work together and participate in the pacification work with a conscious and active attitude." Note: The effectiveness of military-civilian cooperation in eastern Hubei mentioned by Bai refers to the fact that rafts can be used for combat and even platoons can act independently, which is a major advance in military affairs.</p>
<p>[Another Telegram] According to Commander-in-Chief Bai at the welcome meeting: (1) The jurisdiction of the Bandit Suppression General Headquarters is slightly different from what has been reported and is generally limited to the three provinces of Henan, Hubei, and Anhui; (2) A Pacification Headquarters will be established in central Hubei, and Zhang Gan will be appointed as the commander; (3) The bandits who attacked Zaoshi have been defeated, and Yingcheng Southwest has also been relieved of the siege. Another source says: Zhang Gan, Wang Lingyun, and Huo Kuizhang have arrived in Hankou one after another and will attend the military conference of the Bandit Suppression General Headquarters.</p>
<h3>Executive Yuan's Reply on Stabilizing Prices; Control Yuan Members Believe It Is Impractical; Appointed Members to Draft Opinions to Submit to Yuan Meeting for Discussion</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 28th] The 12th meeting of the first session of the Control Yuan under the Constitution was held at 9:30 AM on the 28th, presided over by Yu Youren. First, the secretariat read out the minutes of the 11th meeting, followed by the report and discussion of various cases as follows: (1) A letter from the Legislative Yuan's Legal System Committee, stating that it will review the draft Control Law at 3:00 PM on June 28, requesting attendance for explanation. It was decided to recommend members Tian Jiongjin, Chen Qinghua, and Tang Honglie to attend and explain the drafting process. (2) A respectful telegram from Gao Xibing and others from Shenyang, requesting that the two cities of Panyang and Changchun be included in the U.S. aid material distribution area. It was decided to recommend members Wang Guanwu, Cao Dexuan, Gu Fengxiang, Wang Weiqi, and Qi Dapeng to investigate with the Executive Yuan and then submit it to the meeting for discussion. (3) A motion proposed by Li Xuhuan and 37 others to amend Article 26 of Chapter 5 of the draft Control Law. It was resolved to pass the original motion and send it to the Legislative Yuan for amendment. (4) The Executive Yuan's official letter on the handling of price stabilization in response to the corrective motion previously submitted by the Control Yuan was delivered. The content was very detailed, but the members believed that it was impractical. Hao Yulin proposed a temporary motion stating: "Prices have been fluctuating rapidly in recent days, and the general public is worried. The Executive Yuan's response to the Yuan's corrective motion on soaring prices is grand in content, but it is mostly empty talk and does not help in practice. It is proposed that the general meeting select a number of members to review it and decide on the next step. Please vote." Then Quan Shaowen also proposed a temporary motion with similar views to Hao's motion, which was submitted to the meeting for discussion. Zhang Dinghua spoke first, believing that it was necessary to organize a committee for review. Li Zhengle advocated sending members to the Executive Yuan for investigation. Cui Jingzhang believed that it was necessary to form a committee to review the case and that we should form a special committee for comprehensive discussion. After a majority agreed, it was decided to recommend Wang Guanwu, Xing Senzhou, Sun Yulin, Zhang Dinghua, Zhang Weihan, Cui Shuyan, Hu Wenhui, Liu Pingjiang, Liu Liezhi, and others to form a committee to review it and draft specific opinions to submit to the meeting for discussion. Finally, the draft organizational regulations of the Control Yuan's traveling office were discussed. However, due to time constraints, only Article 3 was discussed, and the chairman announced the adjournment of the meeting. Also, the meeting was adjourned in the afternoon because the members went to the Executive and Legislative Yuan respectively, and it was scheduled to hold the 13th meeting at 9:00 AM on the 29th. (The full text of Dean Weng's reply on prices can be found in the left corner.)</p>
<h3>Legislative Yuan's Finance and Economic Committee Ratifies Flour and Cotton Yarn Tax Rates; Review of Temporary Property Tax Law Not Yet Completed</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 28th] The Finance and Economic Committee of the Legislative Yuan reviewed the flour tax, which the former National Government submitted to the former Legislative Yuan for reconsideration, and approved the collection of 2.5 percent. The cotton yarn tax rate was increased to 10 percent. In addition to approving the case for ratification, three supplementary opinions were passed: (1) The current tax revenue is biased towards military goods tax, and direct tax should be emphasized in the future. (2) After price stabilization, the tax rate of cotton yarn and other ad valorem taxes should be given more consideration. (3) The adjustment period for ad valorem tax should be shortened as much as possible according to the actual situation. The committee's temporary property tax and investigation of wealthy families' capital group held another meeting in the afternoon of the 28th to continue discussing various pending issues: (1) Regarding the tax rate for profitable businesses, the starting point for taxation was resolved to be raised to 300,000 yuan in the currency value of 1937. (2) Regarding the taxation of overseas Chinese property, it was resolved to add an item to the general provisions chapter, stipulating that "overseas Chinese property outside the country is exempt from taxation." (3) Regarding the taxation of foreign property in China, the discussion lasted a long time. Finally, it was passed to add an item to the general provisions chapter, stipulating that "in order to encourage foreign and overseas Chinese investment in production enterprises within the territory of the Republic of China, foreign and overseas Chinese property may be reduced or exempted by the government depending on the nature of their businesses and property." However, Cui Jingbo, Liu Butong, Zhu Wende, and others all believed that there should not be such special and unfair regulations, and they decided to raise their objections again when this preliminary draft is submitted to the Finance and Economic Committee. The group will also ask the conveners of the Finance and Economic Committee to report at the meeting on the 29th the reasons why the temporary property tax law could not be reviewed completely and request an extension. The next group meeting is scheduled for the afternoon of the 30th.</p>
<h3>Effectively Utilize U.S. Aid; Complete Rural Reconstruction; 21 Organizations Draft Plan</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 28th] The Chinese Society of Agronomy, the Chinese Society of Land Economics, and 21 other academic organizations jointly hosted Chinese and foreign reporters on the 28th to report on the main points of the "Chinese Rural Reconstruction Plan" drafted by these organizations.</p>
<p>In addition to military aid and economic construction loans, U.S. aid also designates one-tenth of the economic stabilization loans for rural reconstruction. The Executive Yuan will organize a Rural Reconstruction Committee to be responsible for guidance and supervision. There will be five executive members, three from China and two from the United States.</p>
<p>The plan drafted by these organizations aims to effectively utilize U.S. aid and complete rural reconstruction. It is divided into two major parts: one is the basic work of rural reconstruction, including land reform, farmland water conservancy, etc.; the other is the production increase work of rural reconstruction, including food exports, and the production increase work of materials, clothing, timber, livestock, etc. The total budget listed in the plan is US$29,374,368, of which US$23,037,000 is used for basic work. Of this, about US$800,000 is needed for land reform, and US$6,338,753 is used for production increase work.</p>
<p>It is also learned that the plan has been submitted to the Executive Yuan a few days ago. Zou Bingwen also paid a visit to Dean Weng at 3:00 PM on the 28th and presented the plan again in person. He also suggested to Weng that the Chinese members of the Rural Reconstruction Committee should be experts and people with knowledge and experience. Weng expressed his willingness to adopt these suggestions.</p>
<h3>Shen Honglie Leaves Hangzhou for Shanghai</h3>
<p>[Our Hangzhou Dispatch, 28th] Shen Honglie took the Jinling ship to Shanghai at 8:00 AM this morning. More than a thousand people from various organizations, groups, schools, and department heads of the provincial government in the provincial capital went to the train station to see him off and presented a banner that said "Meritorious Deeds in Zhejiang", and Shen shook hands with the send-off people frequently to bid farewell.</p>
<h3>Weng Wenhao's Reply to the Control Yuan: Explaining the Situation of Stabilizing Prices; Large Military Expenditures Make Inflation Still Unavoidable</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Nanjing 28th Dispatch] The Control Yuan previously pointed out that prices were soaring, but the authorities had not taken timely measures, and submitted a correction proposal to the Executive Yuan. Recently, the Executive Yuan has submitted a reply to the Control Yuan regarding the handling of price stabilization and the various points raised by the Control Yuan. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Your letter of June 16th, Constitutional Letter No. 14, is respectfully acknowledged. The methods to stabilize prices are none other than suppressing internal rebellion, stabilizing society, increasing production, ensuring sufficient supply, improving transportation, facilitating transport, promoting exports, developing national trade, rectifying finances, and suppressing inflation, in order to address the root cause. Cracking down on hoarding, strictly implementing negotiated prices, price limits, banning the circulation of gold and banknotes, managing foreign exchange, and tightening credit are measures to address the symptoms. Since Wenhao took office as the Executive Yuan, he has never relaxed his efforts. Recently, with the surge in prices, he has taken the following measures in response to the facts: (1) Strengthen financial controls to prevent the excessive issuance of promissory notes, so as to avoid credit inflation and stimulate prices. (2) Promote the sale of treasury bonds to tighten credit. (3) Dispatch responsible personnel to North China to improve exchange rates and sell materials in North China, and order the Ministry of Food to issue emergency measures for regulating the people's food supply, order foreign rice, and continue to organize urban food rationing to stabilize public morale. All of these are emergency countermeasures that the government can take today. However, the military situation in various war zones is still very intense, and military expenditures are still very large. The fact of inflation is still unavoidable for the time being, and the upward trend in prices is unlikely to stop quickly. It requires the government and the people of the whole country to jointly understand the difficulties and work together to bring into play the effect of the aforementioned fundamental methods. The Executive Yuan is determined to overcome all difficulties and do its best.</p>
<p>As for the various measures pointed out in the original proposal that the administrative authorities are contributing to the rise in prices, in order to clarify the facts for the members of your esteemed Yuan, I will explain them separately below:</p>
<p>National Banks' Loans: Strict Review, No Leniency</p>
<p>1. Regarding national banks' loans, in order to prevent them from flowing into speculative markets and stimulating prices, they were suspended at the end of October of the 36th year. Later, because general legitimate production enterprises lacked funds and were unable to start or had difficulty with turnover, loans had to be resumed from March of this year. However, in order to prevent abuses, the board of directors of the four joint banks approved and formulated the "Lending Guidelines for Production Enterprises for the 37th Year" (attached). The regulations regarding the review and approval of loans are extremely strict. The targets of production enterprise loans are limited to: 1. production and marketing enterprises for daily necessities of the people's livelihood, 2. basic industrial and mining enterprises, 3. public utility enterprises, 4. export trade enterprises, etc. The lending methods are also stipulated as follows: 1. order loans or purchase of manufactured products, 2. commissioned production, 3. short-term capital turnover, including export packing loans, etc., 4. other loans related to national economic policy. In recent months, all loan cases have been reviewed in accordance with this, without any leniency. The responsibility for lending has been separately stipulated, and the assessment has been carried out diligently to ensure that all funds are used in accordance with the original purpose. It is difficult to say that it is laissez-faire. As for the loan interest rate, according to the above-mentioned lending guidelines, the general principle for production enterprises that are responsible for their own profits and losses is to calculate it with reference to the market interest rate, but it should not exceed the local central bank's listed market interest rate, and loans that fully cooperate with national policy are still handled according to the principle of low interest. Therefore, it is difficult to say that the loan interest rate is too high.</p>
<p>State-Run Transportation Enterprises: Leading Price Increases Is Untrue</p>
<p>2. The prices of services provided by state-run enterprises have had to be adjusted accordingly to maintain operations, as general prices have continued to rise and costs have increased sharply. Although postal, telecommunications, railways, etc., have relied on subsidies from the national treasury for many years, they have still been given appropriate subsidies based on losses. It is even less the case that they rely solely on price increases. The intention is to avoid stimulating prices. Therefore, the transportation prices and postal and telecommunications rates of state-run transportation enterprises have only been adjusted in line with the general price increases, and are far behind. For example, in May of this year, prices rose to about 500,000 times the pre-war level, while transportation costs were only about 130,000 times the pre-war level. The transportation cost adjustment in early June was only about 200,000 times the pre-war level. To say that this is leading price increases is not true. Three sets of statistical charts of prices and transportation costs are attached for reference.</p>
<p>Currency Reform Issue: The Government Is in a Difficult Situation</p>
<p>3. In recent months, domestic public opinion has urged the government to reform the currency system, and many statements have been issued. Many legislators in the Legislative Yuan have also inquired about this. The Executive Yuan has replied that it is studying the matter, but has not mentioned the content of the reform, fearing that it would affect the market. The government's financial officials have not made any advocacy. As the depreciation of legal tender has reached the current stage, the government cannot deny the fact of inflation, and legislators, scholars, and experts all hope for a fundamental solution as soon as possible. The government's situation is very difficult. In the future, the government should be extra cautious, and it is hoped that leaders in society will be able to share the difficulties of the times and refrain from publishing empty and stimulating remarks before the research and preparation are fully completed. In this way, the concerns of your esteemed Yuan can be avoided.</p>
<p>In the future, if your esteemed Yuan has any questions about administrative work that need to be inquired about, the Executive Yuan will provide information at any time and truthfully explain the truth.</p>
<p>The above is a report on the handling of this case and the facts of the matter. Please review it. This is addressed to the Control Yuan.</p>
<p>Attached is a copy of the "Lending Guidelines for Production Enterprises for the 37th Year" from the Joint Office of the Central, China, Communications, and Farmers Banks.</p>
<p>Enclosed are a comparison chart of transportation price adjustments and price increases, an explanation, and a comparison table of transportation price adjustments and price increases.</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Crisis of the Ashida Cabinet</h3>
<p>The wavering Ashida Cabinet of Japan, after overcoming the risks of the past month, has temporarily stabilized its power with the support of the Allied General Headquarters' Political Bureau. However, it has not been fully secured. The no-confidence movement being carried out by the opposition parties in the Japanese Diet is developing vigorously. Whether Ashida can safely overcome the difficulties and whether the budget proposal and the Nishio corruption case can be calmed down are truly doubtful. Even if the Allied Forces have the power to guide the Japanese political tide across the shore and MacArthur's advice to the Japanese people to stop political infighting will have temporary effects, no one dares to say for sure whether the Ashida Cabinet will not undergo changes by July.</p>
<p>The Ashida Cabinet has only been established for more than three months; and the setbacks encountered in the past three months have been more dangerous than the crises of a three-year regime. Ashida Hitoshi, who is known for his adaptability, also feels trapped. The Tokyo Kyodo News Agency recently issued a dispatch saying that "the downfall of the Ashida Cabinet can be counted on the fingers." General observers also believe that "the Ashida Cabinet is currently moving towards a political dead end." This is enough to show the magnitude of the risks Ashida has encountered in the past three months, the depth of the crisis, and the weight of the worries. The development and evolution of the matter can be divided into the following aspects:</p>
<p>First, Ashida Cabinet's masterpiece was the announcement of the "Five-Year Economic Recovery Plan." According to the implementation of this plan, Japan would be able to become stronger by 1952, and the US government also strongly supported this plan. The thorough implementation of this plan requires US funds and raw materials. The US government has submitted a loan to Japan bill to Congress to help with the initial plan's development. Due to the unease of countries such as China, Australia, and the Philippines, and the opposition of public opinion, the US Congress reduced the loan to Japan by 150 million, that is, reducing the total aid by three-sevenths. This was an unexpected blow to the Ashida Cabinet. The Ashida Cabinet, which could have been supported by the Japanese people, after being hit by this blow, the Japanese people's belief in Ashida was shaken, and even the media doubted the success of the Five-Year Plan. This can be said to be the biggest risk and setback encountered by the Ashida Cabinet.</p>
<p>Second, Ashida Cabinet drafted this year's budget proposal a month ago, preparing to submit it to the current Diet for approval. The budget proposal includes a method of suspending the payment of war debt interest for one year. In order to increase government revenue, it is expected to collect 1,000,000,000 yen in taxes out of the total national income of 1,906,000,000 yen. This method was advocated by the left wing of the Socialist Party, but it was not implemented in the Katayama Cabinet, which caused a crisis within the Katayama Cabinet. The Democratic Party cooperated with the left wing of the Socialist Party, and the left wing took this policy as a condition. The policy is correct, but unfortunately, the Japanese taxpayers—the Zaibatsu groups and their kept conservative political parties (such as the Liberal Party and the right wing of the Democratic Party)—fiercely opposed it in the Diet and spread rumors outside the Diet, resulting in the defection of eight members of the right wing of the Democratic People's Party. The Democratic Party led by Ashida was originally a minority party in the Diet. Now, it has been reduced from 92 seats to 84 seats, and there is a possibility of further reduction, which makes Ashida's position more fragile. Now, the Ashida Cabinet's pillar of support in the Diet completely depends on the left and right wings of the Socialist Party.</p>
<p>Third, the right wing of the Socialist Party, with the current Deputy Prime Minister Hiroo Nishio as the main body, has considerable control in the Diet. Recently, Nishio had a dishonorable incident. Someone reported that he had embezzled 500,000 yen; this is a big stain in Japanese political history. Now, this corruption case is being investigated by the Supreme Public Prosecutor's Office. Nishio stated on the 10th that he was willing to resign and retire, and was willing to accept the internal rectification of the Socialist Party, but Ashida Hitoshi supported him and wanted to completely eliminate this accusation. Katayama Tetsu, the leader of the Socialist Party, issued a statement on the 15th: "Nishio is a current cabinet member and should wait until the investigation is clear before deciding whether he must resign." According to Katayama and Ashida's intentions, Nishio will not resign before the budget proposal is passed; after the budget proposal is passed, Nishio will resign in accordance with the environment. The view of the Allied General Headquarters' Political Bureau is also the same; therefore, Ashida's approach may be to sacrifice Nishio in exchange for the passage of the budget proposal. He is completely thinking about the revival of the regime. It is doubtful whether the opposition parties in the Diet will accept Ashida's opinion; and 63 members of the Socialist Party have expressed their disagreement, and coordination has not yet been achieved, which has buried endless crises for the passage of the budget proposal.</p>
<p>The development of the above facts shows that the Ashida Cabinet's move towards a "political dead end" was not accidental, but a well-founded observation. Judging from the general trend, the Ashida Cabinet can temporarily gain stability with the support of the Allied Forces. If Ashida's adaptation is successful, the storms in the Diet may also be passed safely. However, overcoming a difficult situation does not fundamentally resolve Ashida Hitoshi's crisis. At that time, Ashida's approach will be two: (1) After Deputy Prime Minister Nishio resigns, change his political strategy and cooperate with Shigeru Yoshida, attracting the opposition party to resign; (2) Hold a general election and reorganize the government. No matter which of the above two paths Ashida Hitoshi takes, he is only doing some paving work for the conservative forces.</p>

<p>2.  Loan recipients are stipulated as follows: (1) General Categories: (A) Production and sales enterprises of daily necessities for people's livelihood, (B) Basic industrial and mining enterprises, (C) Public transportation enterprises, (D) Export trade enterprises. (2) Applications for loans from those whose material production and sales or business fees are entirely regulated should be processed with priority.</p>
<p>3.  Loan interest rates should be calculated with reference to market interest rates, based on the nature of the loan, as a principle. Deposit interest rates should also be raised accordingly. Detailed measures should be further negotiated and approved separately with reference to the original proposal from the Secretariat on adjusting interest rates on October 20, 36th year.</p>
<p>4.  Loan funding sources should be handled according to the following items: (1) Banks and treasuries handling loan business should, as a principle, use their own surplus funds for allocation. (2) Various loans that support national policy, once approved by the Joint Council of the Four Banks, may at any time be re-mortgaged, re-pledged, or rediscounted with the Central Bank. However, the total limit of re-mortgages and short-term borrowing should be submitted by the Central Bank to the Council for approval. (3) Certain types of loans assigned by the government with relatively special characteristics may be directly allocated from the national treasury. (4) The Central Bank will cease direct loans to production enterprises. (5) Public funds of military and government agencies should be deposited entirely in the Central Bank.

Funds of state-owned enterprises may be held by the various banks and treasuries according to their professional nature.</p>
<p>5.  The review and investigation of loans and re-mortgages should be handled according to the following items: (1) Various order loans, purchase of inventory, commissioned manufacturing, and other loans supporting national policy should be handled according to past practice after being approved by the Council, or after the approval of plans and measures, under the supervision of the Central Bank by the various banks and treasuries separately.

The Discount and Lending Committee may have advisory committees for industry, mining, agriculture, and exports. (4) The assessment of loans should be carried out diligently to ensure that the loans achieve the maximum effect according to the original plan. The responsibility for assessment is stipulated as follows: (A) Each bank and treasury should be responsible for the assessment of loans it has independently approved and report periodically. (B) The Central Bank is responsible for the assessment of loans supporting national policy and the confidential review of re-mortgaged loans, and report periodically.

<p>Comparative Chart of Freight Rate Adjustments and Price Increases (Omitted) Explanation Recorded as Follows:</p>
<p>(1) The chart shows that although freight rate increases follow the same trend as price increases, the multiple of freight rate adjustments has maintained a considerable proportion to the multiple of price increases since the 35th year, with the former accounting for only about 25% of the latter.</p>
<p>(2) However, as prices rise higher, the cost of freight increases dramatically, and maintaining the aforementioned proportion will be extremely difficult. However, the absolute values of the two multiples still differ significantly. In May of this year, the difference between the two was more than 300,000 times. Although freight rates have been adjusted this month (June), the difference between the two is still more than this number.</p>
<p>Comparative Chart of Prices and Freight Rates in Early June of This Year (Omitted) Explanation Recorded as Follows:</p>
<p>This chart uses the price at the time of the last freight rate adjustment on April 1 as the standard. From this observation, two points can be obtained:</p>
<p>(1) Freight rates were not adjusted in May, while gold and rice prices have increased by more than 100%, and coal and cloth prices have also increased by more than 60%.</p>
<p>(2) After the freight rate adjustment in early June, the upward trend of various commodities has largely remained the same (coal prices rose sharply before freight rates, and gold prices rose sharply nearly half a month after freight rates). It does not seem that freight rates are leading commodity prices.</p>

<p>[Reuters, Tokyo, 28th] A major earthquake occurred in central Japan on the afternoon of the 28th, followed by a tsunami, resulting in thousands of casualties and the destruction of dozens of houses. Several towns were razed to the ground, leaving 100,000 people homeless. Initial estimates put the death toll at 600, with at least two passenger trains destroyed. MacArthur has issued a special proclamation ordering the US occupation authorities to provide as much assistance as possible. The Japanese cabinet has also held an emergency meeting to discuss relief measures. Large fires broke out in many areas of the earthquake zone, and refugees are fleeing in droves. Some say that the extent of the damage is no less than the Great Kanto Earthquake of 1923. MacArthur has ordered the dispatch of 70-80 aircraft to the disaster area to transport medicine and food and evacuate refugees. The Japanese cabinet has also approved a relief fund of 100 million yen and requested assistance from the US authorities to facilitate relief efforts.

<p>[United Press, Tokyo, 28th] The area along the Sea of Japan in central Japan was shaken by four powerful earthquakes on the afternoon of the 28th, followed by at least nine tsunamis that slammed the coast. Fragmentary reports indicate that the number of casualties in the three prefectures along the Sea of Japan is at least 300. Most telecommunications have been destroyed. No injuries to Allied personnel have been reported so far, but there is little news coming out of the hardest-hit areas. It is only known that large fires are raging in several cities. The Telecommunications Department here has received reports that Fukui City, with a population of 52,000, is "virtually annihilated," and Kanagawa Prefecture, with a population of 200,000, is "burning." The earthquake began at 3:14 PM and lasted for 20 minutes, affecting coastal prefectures and cities south of Toyama Bay. The Jiji Press reported that the Nagoya Railway Bureau reported 300 casualties in Daishoji Town, with one-third of the town's houses collapsed. The Mainichi Shimbun reported that the Nagoya Observatory reported "ten tsunamis" along the coasts of Ishikawa and Fukui prefectures, with nine waves having already hit the coastal defenses. Jiji Press Nagoya reports that one passenger train overturned, and three sections of another passenger train also overturned.

US telecommunications officer Schomp reported from Nagoya that he had contacted the Kanagawa police, who said that half of Fukui Prefecture had been destroyed and that several places in Kanagawa were on fire, but the situation was under control. Other reports indicate that large cracks have appeared in the ground in many places. The US Army has been unable to contact the military government groups in the earthquake zone. The US military also said that the Kyoto area experienced four consecutive earthquakes, lasting a total of 32 seconds. The most severely affected area was Fukui. Reports indicate that Toyama Prefecture is on fire, and Tokyo clocks have stopped. The Tokyo Central Meteorological Observatory announced that a "considerably strong" earthquake struck central and western Japan, affecting the entire Kanto region and part of Shikoku.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Honolulu, 28th] A very strong earthquake occurred here this morning, shaking for several minutes. Residents were awakened from their dreams and fled to the streets. No damage has been reported.</p>
<h3>Sudden Deterioration of Soviet-Yugoslav Relations; Cominform Expels Yugoslavia; Major Loophole in the Eastern European Bloc</h3>
<p>[Report from This Newspaper] London Radio, 28th: It is reported that the Soviet Union has recently expressed deep dissatisfaction with the Communist Party of Yugoslavia and its leaders, and decided to purge them at a secret meeting of the Cominform held in Romania in June. The Soviet side believes that Yugoslavia is not loyal enough to the communist bloc and has failed to please Western imperialist countries. The accusations made were very severe, adding serious charges such as anti-Sovietism and Trotskyism.</p>
<p>[United Press, Prague, 28th] A communique released here on the 28th revealed that the Cominform expelled Yugoslavia from the organization during a meeting held in Romania in mid-June. The communique also condemned Marshal Tito as a Trotskyist and an opponent of the Soviet system.</p>
<p>[Report from This Newspaper] London Radio, 28th: The changing relationship between the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia has created a major loophole in the Eastern European front. If Yugoslavia completely severs ties with the Soviet bloc, it will be the greatest victory for Western countries in the "Cold War." It is reported that the Soviet Union is dissatisfied with Yugoslavia because it has not provided sufficient support to the Greek guerrillas. The countries of the Eastern European bloc accuse Yugoslavia of abandoning the "internationalist line."</p>
<h3>Merger of Czech Social Democratic Party and Communist Party</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Prague, 27th] Over two thousand delegates of the Czech Social Democratic Party met today and unanimously resolved to merge the Social Democratic Party with the Communist Party.

<h3>Failure of Negotiations for Resumption of Diplomatic Relations Between Greece and Bulgaria</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 27th] Bulgarian Minister Mirra said today that negotiations between Bulgaria and Greece in Washington to restore diplomatic relations have failed and that the situation will be reported to UN Secretary-General Lie.</p>
<h3>It Will Still Take Some Time for Greece to Suppress Guerrillas</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Athens, 27th] Greek Prime Minister Sophoulis said after inspecting the front line that the people should not be overly optimistic about the war to suppress the guerrillas. This offensive by the national army is aimed at the heart of the guerrilla base, and it will take a considerable amount of time to complete it successfully. Although the national army has achieved glorious victories, it must still be vigilant in its operations until the guerrillas are completely eliminated.</p>
<h3>US Aid to Europe Bilateral Agreements; Britain, France, Italy, and Other Countries to Sign First</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 28th] Several countries will sign bilateral agreements individually negotiated between the United States and sixteen countries on the 28th. The first batch will include Britain, Italy, France, and the Scandinavian countries.

<p>[Agence France-Presse, Dublin, 28th] Ireland and the United States today signed a bilateral agreement for the European Recovery Program.</p>
<h3>Soviet Union Creates Berlin Crisis; Three Powers Prepare to Protest; Shows Abandonment of Appeasement Towards the Soviet Union</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 28th] The Foreign Office announced that Foreign Secretary Bevin met today with US Ambassador Douglas and German Ambassador Massigli to decide on the method for Britain, the United States, and France to protest the situation in Berlin to the Soviet Union. US Undersecretary of the Army Draper, who is currently in London on his way from the US to Germany, and General Clay, also attended the meeting. British Commander-in-Chief of Germany Robertson returned to London after being summoned and also attended the meeting as an advisor. A Foreign Office spokesman also revealed that Foreign Secretary Bevin is in constant contact with Secretary of State Marshall by telephone.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 28th] The next step for Britain, the United States, and France to break the Berlin deadlock will be to lodge a joint protest with the Soviet Union, which is expected to be delivered within the week. Britain and the United States are deeply skeptical about the outcome of the protest to the Soviet Union. After Massigli returns to London from Paris, the three powers will draft a protest note in London. In addition, filing a complaint with the Security Council is not impossible, but even if this is done, it will only be to register with the United Nations so that the Germans can understand that what will happen in the future is not due to the three powers. People here believe that unless the Soviet Union changes its tactics, there will be more serious developments in the future. The attitude of Britain and the United States is to make the Soviet Union understand that, regardless of the consequences, the Western countries will no longer take an appeasing attitude.</p>
<h3>British and American Aircraft Begin Transporting Food to Supply the Western Sector of Berlin</h3>
<p>Signs of Easing of Soviet Blockade</p>
<p>[Report from This Newspaper] London Radio, 28th: Berlin reports that ten shiploads of food have arrived in Berlin today. There are signs that the Soviet blockade has eased, but it is still difficult to say whether the situation will be completely clarified.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Berlin, 28th] British and American Air Force transport planes have begun jointly transporting 3,000 pounds of food daily from West Germany to supply the western sector of Berlin. The US Air Force Command announced that it hopes to transfer transport planes from Alaska, the Caribbean, and Texas by the beginning of this week to assist in the transport. Airplanes appeared in the Berlin sky all day today, a great feat by the West since the outbreak of the Berlin crisis. British Royal Air Force planes landed at Tempelhof Airport in the British sector or at the Gatow Airport in the American sector every five minutes. Pedestrians stopped to watch, feeling quite excited.</p>
<h3>Military Committee of the Five-Nation Western European Alliance Holds Secret Meeting in London; Preparing Defense Plans and Seeking Close Liaison with the United States</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 27th] The Military Committee of the Western Union held a meeting in London, the details of which were kept strictly secret. Observers believe that the meeting has made positive progress on preparing a military defense plan for Western Europe and a detailed plan for engaging in liaison with Washington. The Military Committee and the Permanent Political Committee of the Western European Union meet regularly in London. It is expected that the results of this meeting will form the basis for future negotiations with the United States.</p>
<p>Before these negotiations take place, the Consultative Committee of the five foreign ministers will meet in The Hague at the end of July to review the progress of cooperation between the five Western European countries and the liaison with US policy. Canadian Foreign Minister Laurent recently expressed interest in the fact that if the United States actively participates in Western European defense, Canada will support Western European defense cooperation. It is believed here that after the US presidential election, a closer connection will be established between Western European defense plans and US policy. At that time, the design of the Western European Union itself and the expansion of US military strength will enable the two sides to enter a practical stage of military cooperation.</p>
<h3>Truman Signs Foreign Aid Appropriation Bill</h3>
<p>[Report from This Newspaper] New York Radio, 28th: Washington reports that President Truman today signed the US $6 billion foreign aid appropriation bill to provide the largest economic assistance in history to Western European and Far Eastern countries. This funding can be used within fifteen months, but if needed, it can be used within twelve months. President Truman commented that this action demonstrates that the free people of the world can indeed work together to maintain free institutions in stability and peace.</p>
<h3>If Dewey is Elected the Next President, US Foreign Policy Will Not Change; A Consistent Approach to the Soviet Union Will Continue</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 27th] The State Department and the Department of Defense both believe that if Dewey is elected as the next President, the bipartisan policies of Truman and Byrnes will continue. They emphasize that Dewey supports the "Truman Doctrine" and aid to democratic countries around the world, as well as the Marshall Plan and Western Europe's military and economic alliance.</p>
<p>Well-informed sources say that if Dewey is elected as the next President, he will definitely appoint Dulles as Secretary of State. Dulles was a Republican foreign policy advisor at the Moscow and London foreign ministers' conferences and has always maintained close cooperation with Senator Vandenberg of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. Well-informed sources believe that Dulles and Vandenberg will continue to cooperate in the Dewey administration to promote the firm policy advocated by the Truman Doctrine. In addition to European issues, Dewey and Dulles are more willing for the United States to pay close attention to developments in the Far East. Vice President nominee Warren, the current governor of California, is even more interested in the countries of the Pacific. Because "California has always been the gateway to the Pacific," Dewey, Dulles, and Warren will adopt a "firm" policy towards the Soviet Union. However, in Europe, their policy will focus on supporting democratic countries, rather than Truman's containment of communism.</p>
<h3>US Black Association Condemns Truman</h3>
<p>For Failing to Order the Prohibition of Discrimination Against Blacks</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Kansas City, 27th] The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) held its 39th annual meeting here on the 27th. Executive Secretary White delivered a speech saying that blacks support Wallace because blacks "despise and are disappointed in" the two major parties. White expressed regret that President Truman has not yet ordered the prohibition of discrimination in the federal government. He also said that Republican presidential nominee Dewey avoided mentioning this matter in 1944 in order to be nominated at the convention and elected President, but in 1945 he continued to pass anti-discrimination legislation in New York State.</p>
<h3>Bernadotte Has Proposed New Peace Proposals for the Holy Land to the Arabs and Jews; Arab League Meeting in Cairo Today to Discuss</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 28th] Arab League Secretary-General Azzam announced in Cairo that the Arab League received Bernadotte's Palestine peace proposals on the 28th, and the Arab League Political Committee will hold a meeting in Cairo on the 29th to discuss them. A spokesman for the Israeli government in Tel Aviv said that the Israeli government is also expected to receive Bernadotte's peace proposals tonight and will study them immediately. They will be presented to the Jewish National Council for discussion on Thursday.</p>
<p>Neither the Arabs nor the Jews are willing to disclose the content of the proposals. However, Arab League sources say that any necessary modifications will be proposed, indicating that the Arab League is expected to accept the proposals. A dispatch from Rhodes states that Bernadotte said that after the Arabs and Jews study his proposals, they are free to offer opinions and suggestions, and that he will give full consideration to all suggestions from both sides, because peace is always the ultimate goal of the United Nations. Observers in London are unwilling to predict the outcome before the content of Bernadotte's proposals is announced, but judging from the positions already declared by the Arabs and Jews, it is still unclear how the opinions of both sides can be brought into agreement.</p>
<h3>British Dockworkers' Strike Spreads; Threatening Food Supplies and Hitting Exports; Government Authorities Prepare to Take Emergency Measures</h3>
<p>[Report from This Newspaper] London Radio, 28th: British Prime Minister Attlee said today that the government has asked the King to declare a state of emergency to deal with the dockworkers' strike, as the strike is threatening Britain's food supplies and hitting exports. Attlee also said that the government will take all necessary measures to maintain the nation's food supply.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 28th] The London dockworkers' strike, which entered its third week, spread to the two major ports of Liverpool and Glasgow today, and then continued to expand. Dockworkers at the export port of Birkenhead also went on strike en masse this afternoon. The strike committee announced that workers in the ports of Southampton and Manchester would decide tonight whether or not to strike. To date, the number of dockworkers on strike in various places has reached 40,000, including 19,000 in the Inner London area. The Cabinet held an emergency meeting at 10 Downing Street to discuss countermeasures. Trade Minister Wilson issued an urgent appeal to the workers, urging them to act rationally, pointing out that the losses to the export industry have already reached millions of pounds, and if the strike is prolonged, the losses will be even greater.</p>
<h3>British Prime Minister's Speech Condemns Communist Ideology</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Skegness, Lincolnshire, 27th] Prime Minister Attlee addressed 25,000 farmworkers here, saying that communism originated in the East and does not belong to the main current of democratic thought. Britain's human rights standards are higher than those of the East, so its living standards are also higher than those of the East. The British people should recognize that Britain is determined to maintain its way of life. Attlee also said that most of those who accuse the United States of trying to bully Europe are communists or communist sympathizers. These people do not want Europe to restore its sound foundation, but rather see Europe fall into a state of poverty, making it easier for people to accept communism. The British people trust their own democratic socialism and will never accept communism.</p>

<h3>Four Demands from Private School Teachers' Petition: Sitting and Waiting in Front of the Education Bureau; Seeking Solutions with Authorities Again Today</h3>
<p>[Our Own Report] Yesterday afternoon, private primary school teachers petitioned the Education Bureau regarding loan funds and rice rations. By 9 PM, about two to three hundred people had gathered, sitting in the rain along the area of Lin Sen Middle Road and Ma Dang Road, singing, shouting slogans, and declaring that they would sit and wait until dawn. As of 3 AM this morning, they had not yet dispersed. The police were on strict alert, and fortunately, no incidents occurred. It is reported that the teachers will send representatives to meet with the Mayor, Speaker, and Director Li again today to discuss a solution.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the Private School Principals' Association sent representatives to the Municipal Council to petition at 5 PM. In addition to being received by councilors, Mayor Wu personally met with them and stated that the private primary and secondary school teachers and staff jointly requested a government loan of 120 billion yuan. The Four Allied Bureaus have not yet approved it, but the Municipal Government has decided to have the Municipal Bank provide an advance loan of 40 billion yuan, with the remainder to be issued after formal approval. As for the May and June rice rations, the Civil Affairs Bureau has been instructed to issue them before the 30th without fail. The representatives expressed satisfaction and then departed.</p>
<h3>Visiting the Education Bureau Director: Unwilling to Reveal Names</h3>
<p>The "Shanghai Private School Teachers' Petition Group for Reasonable Living," which has been holding its ground in front of the Education Bureau since yesterday and has not dispersed as of this morning, initially gathered just over a hundred people. It was at 3 PM yesterday that they petitioned the Education Bureau. Leading the way was a cloth banner with a galloping horse, symbolizing prices. Behind the horse, "3 million yuan" was written, representing salary, and below that was a slogan: "Prices are galloping every day, teachers can't make ends meet." They made four demands to the Education Bureau: (1) A 10 million loan to be issued before the end of June, to be enjoyed by all current teachers and staff. (2) Special rice rations for May and June to be issued before the end of June, with good quality and sufficient quantity. (3) Rice rations from July to September to maintain the original price, and one peck of household rice will not be returned. (4) Additional subsidies for private schools this semester (the current subsidy is 130,000 yuan per person). More than ten representatives were sent to see Director Li of the Education Bureau. First, they were received by Director Zhu of the National Education Department. The representatives insisted on not writing down the names of the schools or the names of the representatives. Director Zhu insisted that they sign their names before he would convey their message to Director Li. The representatives firmly refused, and the stalemate lasted for more than 30 minutes. The representatives then withdrew, and more than 100 people outside the door sang and shouted slogans. Later, Director Li agreed to meet with the representatives who refused to sign their names. The representatives described the plight of primary school teachers, and Director Li expressed his sympathy. However, regarding the loan and rice ration issues, representatives of the Primary School Teachers' Association were already at the Municipal Council awaiting Mayor Wu's reply. As for the issue of private school teacher salaries, it should be the responsibility of the board of directors and the principals. However, standing on the position of safeguarding education, he would try to find solutions within the possible range for everyone's living difficulties. The representatives withdrew at around 6 PM. The petitioning crowd outside the door felt that the response was unsatisfactory and remained in a stalemate.</p>

<h3>Rejecting Tai Shuangqiu's Persuasion</h3>
<p>After 9 PM, private school teachers who heard the news arrived one after another, totaling two to three hundred people, and wrote slogans on the walls of the Education Bureau and the road with chalk. At around 10 PM, Tai Shuangqiu, a figure in the education community, arrived and persuaded them to go back, saying that he had visited the authorities and that solutions for each of their demands would be sought tomorrow (i.e., today), but he was rejected by them. At 10:40 PM, Chief Inspector Zhang Wei of the Police Bureau and Chief Chen Zhiqing of the Songshan Road Police Station arrived and repeatedly persuaded them, and notified the crowd at the scene that the Municipal Council had already decided that before the National Bank allocated funds, the Municipal Bank would first allocate 40 billion yuan, and each person could receive 2.6 million yuan. The petitioning crowd expressed dissatisfaction, saying that they were asking for a loan of 10 million yuan, but now they could only get 2.6 million yuan, which was too far off.</p>
<p>At around 11 PM, Jiao Tong University and other schools came to comfort them with flags. There was a red steel flag with the words "Persistence Guarantees Victory" written on it. It circled around once, and applause broke out wherever it passed.</p>
<h3>Promising a Solution Today: The Crowd Still Refuses to Disperse</h3>
<p>At around 12 AM, Tai Shuangqiu visited Pan Yichang, and Speaker Pan told him: "This matter is not difficult to solve. As long as there is a reason, it can be discussed. Tomorrow (i.e., today), private school teachers will send ten representatives to the Municipal Council to discuss this matter in order to find a proper solution. However, if there are more than ten representatives, they will not be received." Tai immediately told the crowd at the scene about this, but the crowd still sat on both sides of the road, unwilling to disperse. As of 3 AM this morning, they were still in a stalemate.</p>
<h3>Railway Bureau Will Raise Prices Next Month: Income Cannot Cover Expenses</h3>
<p>[Our Own Report] Due to the continuous and drastic increase in prices in the past month, the income from passenger and freight transport of the Beijing-Shanghai Railway Bureau cannot cover its expenses, and the red figures are rising in a straight line. The bureau held a bureau affairs meeting yesterday to discuss ways to increase revenue and reduce expenditure, and decided that all railway, vehicle, and miscellaneous materials, regardless of whether they are urgently needed, will be temporarily suspended from purchase for one week. At the same time, a materials usage review committee composed of Deputy Director Zeng Shirong and six others will be organized to avoid waste.

It is expected that it can be realized in early next month.</p>
<h3>The Living Index Will Be Published Monthly Starting Next Month: The Calculation Method of Rice and Coal Will Be Changed Again: Striving for Unified Precision and Accuracy</h3>
<p>[Our Own Report] Regarding the proposal of the General Labor Union to compile and publish the cost of living index twice a month, the Social Affairs Bureau held a meeting yesterday to discuss it. Director Wu of the Social Affairs Bureau, Statistics Director Zhang Zongmeng of the Municipal Government, and Shui Xiangyun, Ye Xianggao, Zhang Zhusan, Fang Rusheng and more than ten others from the General Labor Union attended the meeting. As a result of the consultation, it was decided that starting next month, the cost of living index will be published on the 15th and 30th. The past practice of investigating once every Wednesday will be changed to twice every Tuesday and Friday. The calculation methods of rice and coal prices will be fundamentally changed to strive for precision and accuracy. Director Wu also called Mayor Wu to request approval of this decision.</p>
<p>Director Wu, because of the recent sharp increase in prices, specifically ordered the Statistics Office to re-statistically analyze the recent price increases, and strive for the accuracy of the index, in order to avoid unnecessary losses to workers.</p>
<p>[Another News] It was also resolved at yesterday's meeting that the distribution of coal to industrial and occupational workers in the city will be suspended starting this month, and the coal price in this month's index will be calculated at market price. Also, the distribution of rice to workers in February of this year will be supplemented by 50,000 dan of rice allocated by the Civil Affairs Bureau at the request of Director Wu, and each worker will receive approximately one peck of rice.</p>
<h3>Warning to Profiteers: Money or Life? Military and Police Authorities Seek to Suppress Prices: Suggesting the Most Severe Measures; No Coexistence with Degenerates of Ethnic Minorities</h3>
<p>Recently, prices in the city have risen to unprecedented levels, especially the black market for gold banknotes, essential goods for people's livelihood, and stock speculation. The local military and police authorities are responsible for maintaining law and order and cannot remain silent. On the morning of the 28th, Garrison Commander Xuan Tiewu invited the heads of the army, navy, and air force agencies in Shanghai and the constitutional police authorities to an emergency meeting on the third floor of the Garrison Headquarters to discuss sanctioning speculative merchants and suppressing prices. Bai Chang of the Wusong Fortress Command, Dong Muzeng of the First Naval District, Wang Weimin of the Air Force Supply Command, Chuan Zhengmo of the Shanghai Garrison District Command, Yu Shuping, Chief of the Police Bureau, Cai Longren, Chief of the Ninth Regiment of the Military Police, Fang Maokai, Second Brigade Commander of the 202nd Division of the Youth Army, and the Chief of Staff of the Port Command, and dozens of others all agreed that most of the factors contributing to the rising prices in the city were man-made. The military and police, carrying out the sacred task of suppressing the rebellion and protecting the people, do not allow speculative merchants to hoard materials, raise market prices, harm people's livelihood, and shake the foundation of the country. It is necessary to use armed forces to assist the deficiencies of the administration and save the crisis that is about to collapse across the board, so as to ensure the early success of suppressing the rebellion and the timely establishment of a fair and reasonable social system. It was decided that: (1) Daily necessities for people's livelihood will be fully rationed, (2) The black market for gold banknotes will be absolutely prohibited, (3) Speculation and manipulation will be thoroughly eliminated, (4) Price increases will not be allowed to continue, (5) Warehouses will be inspected and materials controlled, (6) Trading houses will be monitored and finance controlled. The generals present also put forward two warning slogans: "Choose money, don't choose life" and "Choose life, don't choose money" to tell speculative merchants. In addition to submitting the above opinions to the government for immediate implementation, they will continue to study specific implementation methods, and be prepared to take direct action when necessary. Finally, it was solemnly decided that there will be no coexistence with degenerates of ethnic minorities. Even if they escape to Hong Kong, they will not be safe. As for legitimate merchants and production enterprises, the military and police will still provide practical protection with their past loyalty.</p>
<h3>Martial Law May Be Reimposed in This City</h3>
<p>Another report. Prices in the city have been soaring and skyrocketing in recent days, and the Communist bandits are seizing the opportunity to move. In order to ensure the security of the city, the Songhu Garrison Command may reimpose martial law. It is expected that the overall war system implemented in Central China will be implemented in the Songhu area earlier. If the overall war system is implemented, politics, economy, and military will become one, and these speculative profiteers will have nowhere to hide.</p>
<h3>The Control Yuan Sends Personnel to Shanghai to Investigate the Causes of Price Increases</h3>
<p>Yesterday, according to reliable sources, the Control Yuan believes that the recent surge in prices in Shanghai must be due to man-made factors. It has specifically sent a member of the Control Yuan to Shanghai to investigate, so as to provide a reference for deciding on suggestions to the government to correct the price situation. A member of the Control Yuan told a reporter from the East China News Agency that the Control Yuan General Assembly had submitted a proposal to the Executive Yuan to correct prices, and it is currently awaiting a factual report.</p>
<h3>The Transport Management Committee Adjusts Oil Prices: All Parties Express Dissatisfaction</h3>
<p>The prices of gasoline, diesel, and fuel oil were approved for adjustment by the Transport In and Out Management Committee yesterday. The new prices are as follows: (1) Gasoline adjusted to 820,000 yuan per gallon, (2) Light diesel 130,070,700 yuan per ton, (3) Medium diesel 124,695,000 yuan per ton, (4) Heavy diesel 100,665,700 yuan per ton, (5) Fuel oil 91,625,000 yuan per ton. According to the person in charge of the Transport Management Committee, the main reason for this adjustment is that the exchange rate for oil imports continues to rise, which affects import costs. However, all parties are quite resentful of the committee's repeated adjustments of prices without focusing on unblocking sources and resolving panic. The new prices have been implemented by major oil companies and gas stations in the city since yesterday, and black market prices have also secretly risen to 900,000 yuan per gallon since yesterday.</p>

<h3>China Merchants Steam Navigation Company Sends Personnel to Take Back the Guo Qing Ship</h3>
<p>[Our Own Report] The Guo Qing Ship was originally the Sao Hua Ship, renamed from an enemy property, with a total tonnage of 542 tons. After the victory, it was taken over by the Enemy and Puppet Property Handling Bureau and handed over to the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company for agency, which leased it to Fo Heng Company to travel the Sichuan River. The bureau repeatedly wanted to take it back, but was rejected. Recently, it was heard that the ship had been sublet by Fo Heng Company to the China Import and Export Company and continued to sail the Shanghai-Chongqing line. Now the Enemy and Puppet Property Handling Bureau wants to take it back from the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, so the bureau has sent a document to the Maritime Administration Bureau. It happened that the ship was now in Shanghai, docked at the Guanqiao Wharf in Nanshi to load cargo and was about to sail to Chongqing. Yesterday, the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company sent personnel to receive it together with personnel from the Maritime Administration Bureau. As for whether the goods already loaded on the ship can still be transported to Chongqing, or unloaded and returned to customs, it was not decided yesterday.</p>
<h3>The Chairman of the Round Woodworking Union Suddenly Disappears: More Than 200 Workers Petitioned Yesterday</h3>

Unexpectedly, during the mediation, more than 200 workers in the industry went to the Social Affairs Bureau to petition, claiming that Zhao Fuyang, the chairman of the union, had declared his disappearance, and requesting a thorough investigation. At that time, personnel from the Second Department of the bureau received them, persuaded the workers to disperse, and promised to investigate the facts before handling the matter.</p>

<h3>Tragedy in the Bund Park: Visitors Gather to Watch and Sigh: Flesh and Blood Enduring Separation: Abandoning Children Only Because of Poverty</h3>
<p>[Our Own Report] A light drizzle was falling in the sky. At 6:15 in the evening, there were only dozens of visitors sparsely scattered in the Bund Park. Suddenly, a child's piercing cry came from beside the goldfish pond at the park entrance, and soon attracted a crowd of people.</p>
<p>This was a not-so-clean child, about four years old, with brownish-yellow skin, wearing a floral cloth skirt, barefoot, and wearing cloth shoes. Presumably unable to speak, she was just crying sadly. In her hand, she was holding more than a dozen sugar peanuts. "I don't know whose child this is, but she's a pretty good child," said a woman wearing a black Xiangyun gauze dress. "I guess she's lost," someone interjected.</p>
<p>But a gardener found a small note on the child's back. Although the handwriting was not beautiful, it was written quite neatly. I stepped forward to take a look, and it was a few sentences like this: "This is a pitiful girl. She is four years old this year. Because her biological father has been unemployed for four years, and her biological mother has abandoned her, there is no way out. I hope that benevolent gentlemen will pick her up and support her to end her remaining life." There was no name below, and of course, there was no address.</p>
<p>The gardener picked up the child. The child was still crying non-stop. Someone gave her a one-thousand-yuan Guan Jin note, but she didn't want it and threw it on the ground. "Whose child is this..." Compassionate voices floated in the air.</p>
<p>It was the park manager who came up with an idea: send her to the police station. Gardener No. 274 mercifully gently picked up this helpless child, left the park gate, and walked towards the Customs House, and soon disappeared into the crowd on the Jianggan side.</p>
<p>Do you also have children? But they don't want them anymore!</p>
<h3>The Legislative Yuan's Property Tax Collection Bill: The Council General Assembly Decides to Request Deferral: Requesting a Separate Draft Law for Collecting Donations from the Wealthy or Promoting Special Donations</h3>
<p>[Our Own Report] The sixth meeting of the Municipal Council was held in its fifth session yesterday. The property tax collection bill, which was contested and unresolved at the four previous meetings, has obtained a compromise resolution. In addition, the proposals of the Finance, Public Utilities, and Police Affairs groups all obtained conclusions smoothly in a lightly depicted atmosphere.</p>
<p>Yesterday's meeting was delayed until 3:40 PM before it began. The first item proposed for discussion was the property tax collection bill. After the chairman summarized the four opinions on property tax expressed at the four previous meetings, he finally put forward a comprehensive opinion as follows:</p>
<p>"We telegraph the Legislative Yuan to suggest that it quickly draft a separate law for collecting donations from the wealthy and hand it over to the government for earnest implementation, or urge the government to strengthen the promotion of special relief donations to enrich the national treasury and meet the urgent needs of suppressing the rebellion. The collection methods of the temporary property tax law currently under review are not entirely appropriate. After consideration of the implementation, it will inevitably lead to disturbances and hinder legitimate production enterprises. There is nothing more serious than this. We should request deferral of discussion to reassure the people." Subsequently, Fan Xipin, Ye Fenghu, Zhou Lianze, Jia Dechao, and others expressed their opinions separately. Finally, the matter was put to a vote. Among the 132 councilors present, 101 raised their hands in favor of the above comprehensive opinion, which was passed by an overwhelming majority.</p>
<p>General Manager of the Municipal Bank Reports on Business Overview</p>
<p>Immediately afterward, General Manager Huang Jin and Deputy General Manager Bao Yugang of the Municipal Bank reported on the bank's business situation, respectively. The report content was divided into four points: (1) The process of resuming business, (2) Organization, (3) Business overview, (4) Past surplus figures. Regarding the business department, the bank made the following report: The main business of this bank is to facilitate citizens to pay taxes and handle the municipal government's treasury. In addition to collecting taxes and handling treasury revenue and expenditure, it also operates ordinary banking business in accordance with national policies and laws to increase income and maintain expenses. As of May, the total deposits of this bank amounted to 947.3 billion yuan, including 309 billion yuan in ordinary deposits and 638.3 billion yuan in treasury deposits. The total loans amounted to 284.5 billion yuan, including 224.5 billion yuan in loans related to municipal construction and public utilities, and 60 billion yuan in loans for cultural and news undertakings.</p>
<p>After the report was completed, Chu Shun raised several questions, but due to limited time, it was finally decided to submit the questioning questions and the proposals related to the Municipal Bank to the Finance Committee for review.</p>
<p>The Finance Committee's Resolution: Strictly Punish the Abuse of Issuing Banker's Drafts</p>
<p>After discussion, the remaining proposals of the Finance Committee decided to request the General Assembly to send three cases to the Gold Control Bureau for reference: (1) Please strictly stop the issuance of disguised large notes, so as to avoid stimulating prices and affecting the livelihood of the common people. (2) For banks issuing traveler's checks and abusing the issuance of banker's drafts, invisibly and disguisedly increasing the legal tender chips and devaluing the currency value, it is proposed that the Gold Control Bureau order them to stop business and severely punish them according to law. (3) It is proposed to request the Municipal Government and the Gold Control Bureau to prohibit trading houses from raising interest rates, soliciting deposits, stimulating prices, and fueling the hoarding trend. The two cases passed: (1) It is proposed to request the Control Yuan to thoroughly investigate and announce the actual situation of the Central Bank's use of foreign exchange in the past two years, and the actual situation of import and export management, in order to learn from it and seek improvement. (2) Please request the government to quickly organize and issue a supervisory committee, publicly issue the amount, and rectify the original tax revenue to balance the normal budget and sell state assets to balance the extraordinary budget. The other two cases of limiting trading houses to recover banker's drafts and strengthening securities trading were passed for retention.</p>
<p>Restrictions on Car Transfers: Decided to Request the Authorities to Abolish Them</p>
<p>There were a total of twenty proposals from the Public Utilities Group. Important proposals passed: (1) Please request the Municipal Government to submit a detailed report to the Central Government and abolish the method of restricting car transfers immediately. It is also suggested that a special relief donation be collected during the transfer. (2) On the proposal to suggest to the Central Government to abolish the method of automatic adjustment of public utilities, the opinion of the Public Utilities Investigation Committee was passed, and the calculation formula should still be temporarily maintained. However, the base numbers used in the formula should be reduced in accordance with the opinions proposed in the report of the Investigation Committee to lighten the burden on the people. Other proposals sent to the Municipal Government or the Public Utilities Bureau for reference or handling include (1) Improving the gasoline allocation method. (2) Please request the two railway bureaus to quickly build Shanghai South Station. (3) Please extend the bus routes of Route 5. (4) Please increase the number of Route 11 buses running from Linqing Road to Shanghai University. (5) Quickly assist Shanghai Huashang Electric Company to recover the power generation machines that were dismantled by the enemy and sent to North China to increase the power supply in Nanshi, etc. The case of requesting the Municipal Government to order the power company to stop the measure of power outages in textile factories was decided to be sent to the Public Utilities Bureau to study and improve the method and promote the early establishment of the United Electric Company. Regarding increasing the gasoline quota for industrial use to rescue the factories that have stopped work, it was proposed that the Municipal Government and the Transport Management Committee should earnestly handle it.</p>
<h3>Representatives Opposing the New Tax: Visiting Various Leaders in Nanjing</h3>
<p>[Our Own Report from Nanjing, 28th] Labor Jingxiu and twelve other representatives of Shanghai industry and commerce opposing the temporary property tax arrived in Nanjing on the morning of the 28th. They first visited Secretary-General Wu Tiecheng of the Central Party Headquarters, stating the reasons for opposing the tax and asking the Kuomintang for support. Wu promised to forward the matter to the Central Political Committee for consideration. Then they visited Secretary-General Zhang Junyuan of the Legislative Yuan, asking for permission to attend the afternoon subcommittee meeting of the Finance and Finance Committee to discuss the case. Then they visited Finance Minister Wang Yunwu. Wang told them that the matter was not initiated by the Ministry of Finance, and the country needs to increase tax revenue as a fact. However, he never sang a duet with Committee Member Liu Butong. He laughed and said that if they went to the Legislative Yuan, they could learn more details and even gain something, because the power to decide this matter was actually in the hands of the Legislative Yuan. At 4 PM, the representatives attended the subcommittee meeting of the Legislative Yuan's Finance and Finance Committee on the temporary property tax and the investigation of wealthy capital, where Pan Shihao, Hu Xiyuan, and Liu Jingji reported the reasons for opposing the temporary property tax. At 5 PM, they visited President Sun. Sun said that he was the president of the Legislative Yuan and it was inconvenient to express his opinion. However, the matter was still under discussion, and he hoped that they would strive to win the sympathy of the legislators. At 6 PM, they visited President Weng. His reply was roughly the same as that of Finance Minister Wang. The Executive Yuan would look to the Legislative Yuan for guidance on this matter. At about 8 PM, the representatives attended a joint tea party of the Nanjing Municipal Chamber of Commerce and the Construction Industry Association to exchange views on the matter and decided to petition the Legislative Yuan on the morning of the 29th and take unified action with industry and commerce across the country.</p>

<p>After the garbage was collected, Chairman Wu, representing the mayor, reported that: (1) The loan funds for primary school teachers originally had to be approved by the Four Allied Bureaus before they could be issued by the National Bank.

<p>The Shipping Industry Association, citing that the original fares were difficult to maintain costs, initially resolved last week to adjust them by 80% and reported this to the Ministry of Communications. However, the Ministry has not yet responded, and as prices have continued to rise, the industry association convened another emergency meeting yesterday. They resolved that all passenger and freight fares on all routes would be temporarily increased by 80% effective immediately. At the same time, based on the most recent calculation of shipping costs, they requested the Ministry of Communications to make a reasonable adjustment.</p>
<p>Furthermore, regarding the fare adjustment issue of the China National Aviation Corporation, the Ministry of Communications has not yet given its approval. According to the person in charge of the CNAC: even if the fares were adjusted by 180%, it would still be difficult to sustain operations. Chinese civil aviation fares are in fact very cheap. As a comparison, the current fare from Shanghai to Beiping is 38.7 million yuan, which is only a little over eight US dollars. In the United States, one hour of air travel costs 17 US dollars. The flight from Shanghai to Beiping takes four hours, which would cost 68 US dollars. Therefore, the Chinese civil aviation industry urgently hopes that the government can fully understand this situation to make a reasonable solution, otherwise, there is the possibility of suspension of flights at any time due to difficulty in maintaining operations.</p>
<h3>### Rapist of Garment Factory Worker, Liu Fangrong, Tried Yesterday</h3>
<p>[Our Reporter] Zhang Qinlan, a sixteen-year-old female worker at the Huxi Garment Factory on Changshou Road, possessed some beauty, which attracted the attention of Liu Fangrong (age 22, from Jiangxi), a male worker at the same factory. In September of last year, Liu lured her to Zhongshan Park and the Great World for entertainment. Afterwards, he raped her at the Huatong Hotel on Jiaozhou Road, depriving her of her virginity. On December 31st, Liu tricked her into another act of rape at the Xinkang Hotel on Kangding Road. As a result, in May of this year, Zhang's aunt discovered the situation and reported it to the police station, which arrested Liu and transferred him to the District Procuratorate for investigation. Liu confessed to the above, but claimed that he had obtained Zhang's consent. However, the District Procuratorate noted that Zhang was under 14 years of age at the time of the rape, and according to the law, the case should be prosecuted as rape of a minor. Therefore, a public prosecution was initiated. Yesterday morning, Judge Xie Zhiying interrogated him in the Eighth Criminal Court and ordered a postponement for further hearing.</p>
<h3>### Bloodshed on Zhongshan West Road: Maternal Uncle Conspires for Money, Robs and Chops Niece</h3>
<p>[Our Reporter] At approximately 12:40 pm on the 26th, the Longhua Police Sub-bureau received a report that a girl had been chopped and was in critical condition near Caoxi Road on Zhongshan West Road. Deputy and Assistant Sub-bureau Chiefs Zhou Jingbo and Ji Zhonglun immediately ordered Section Chief Guo Jitian to lead officers Xu Zhenheng, Police Chief Ye Jintao, officers Chen Ronggui, Wang Liangbo, and Yang Bin to the scene to investigate the truth. They learned that the victim was Zhang Jingyan, 12 years old, who had been chopped once on the head and twice on the right arm. She was unconscious at the time. The police immediately rushed her to Zhongshan Hospital for treatment. A sharp new kitchen knife with bloodstains, a handkerchief, several hairpins, and a schoolbag were found at the scene. At around 6:00 pm in the afternoon, the injured girl Zhang Jingyan was able to speak. She stated that she lived at 337 Julu Road and her father, Zhang Qitang, runs the Wuhe Hardware Store on Beijing East Road. She was a fourth-grade student at the Tongyi Elementary and Middle School on Julu Road. At lunchtime today, Yang Jigen (see picture), the younger brother of her uncle's wife, whom she called maternal uncle, tricked her into riding a rickshaw to the countryside of Longhua. After getting off, they walked behind the graveyard, where Yang pushed her to the ground, took out a new kitchen knife, and chopped her several times. He forcibly removed the gold ring on her hand and ran away. She then lost consciousness. After listening to her statement, the police notified the girl's father to come to the station. It was learned that the perpetrator, Yang Jigen, was only 19 years old, did not have a proper job, and lived on the upper floor of Building 3 in Ruicun, Xilin Rear Road, Laoximen. Section Chief Guo urgently ordered officers Huang Lianxiang, Gao Zhiyu, Huang Ruilin, and others to investigate at various entertainment venues, ports, train stations, and other locations. At the same time, officers were selected to wait at his residence. The next morning at 8:00 am, the perpetrator indeed returned home and was arrested by the police and brought to the station for interrogation. He confessed to the crime. The sub-bureau, having clarified the case, transferred the perpetrator to the District Procuratorate for prosecution yesterday.</p>

<h3>Eliminating Smuggling to Benefit Industry and Commerce; Opening Up Remittance Quotas to South China; National Banks Can Stop Remittances at Any Time If There Is Market Volatility</h3>
<p>[Our Reporter] It is reported that the financial authorities have opened up remittances to South China since yesterday. In the past, remittances to South China were limited to 50 million yuan, and anything exceeding this amount required approval. This limit has been lifted since yesterday. The purpose of this measure by the authorities is to eliminate the smuggling of cash and to benefit industry and commerce. However, to prevent price fluctuations in South China as a result, the Central Bank can consider the price and market situation and has the right to announce the suspension of remittances at any time, returning the original funds. At the same time, the previous limit of 200 million yuan on remittances from South China to Shanghai has also been lifted simultaneously yesterday.</p>
<p>Also, the "Regulations on the Restriction of Domestic Remittances and Cash Transportation," which was previously promulgated and implemented by the Ministry of Finance, remains in effect and has not been changed. Rumors of opening up domestic remittances are not true. However, the original quota (ranging from 10 billion to 20 billion yuan per week for national banks and 1 billion yuan per day for commercial banks) for national banks to allocate funds to their peers in Guangzhou and Shanghai has now been cancelled. Any banks requesting the national banks to allocate funds for remittances handled in accordance with the "Regulations on the Restriction of Domestic Remittances" are currently not subject to geographical or numerical restrictions. This measure was stipulated by the national banks in response to repeated requests from national banks.</p>
<h3>Suspension of Northeast Circulating Certificates; Prices in Beiping and Tianjin Plummet</h3>
<p>[Our Reporter, Beiping, 28th] Today, Beiping and Tianjin began suspending the exchange of circulating certificates, and prices generally fell, and the black market also stopped. Merchants engaged in receiving circulating certificates had already refused to accept them since the evening of the 26th. On the 27th, there were small transactions, with the purchase price dropping sharply to 8 yuan, and today no one is buying. At the same time, prices plummeted, especially for gold and silver. Gold fell to 170 million, silver dollars to 1.75 million, and "Bingshipowen" powder to 8.5 million, a drop of 2 million. Cloth prices remained flat, and other goods fell. It is a pity that the National Bank lowered the discount rate on short-term treasury bills to 85.2, and the interest rate was increased to two or three cents, and prices in the North are expected to remain at a small well-being in the short term as a result. However, this measure has clearly affected the established policy of the National Bank. The three important officials, Xia, Li, and Wang, in Tianjin have decided to go to Northeast China. Shi Kuiling, Director of the Tianjin Financial Management Bureau, is going with them. The North China Suppression Headquarters will have an important economic meeting this afternoon.</p>
<h3>New Purchases Follow One Another; Hua Shares Have a Firm Foothold</h3>
<p>Although the environment for Hua shares was unfavorable yesterday and credit was tight again, some began to liquidate and exchange shares, so after several struggles, they were able to close with a stable appearance, and the future is already favorable.</p>
<p>At the morning opening, due to the large weekend recall from outside the industry, the market already called for lower prices. Yongs yarn opened at a low of 4,950 yuan, was bought up to 5,170 yuan, and then dropped to 5,070 yuan. The agency fee opened low at 76 yuan and 82 yuan, and rose to 5,230 yuan. Credit was extremely tight, and No. 106 and No. 129 sold off. Although there was a small struggle in the middle, it still fell to 5,030 yuan. The Hong Kong telegram shrank to 1.3 cents. Near noon, Tian No. 197 and others absorbed the selling and raised the price to 5,240 yuan at the close. Compared with last Saturday, after Mayar changed to small shares, there was a considerable increase. Zhongxing rose by 10%, Lian'an new shares rose to the limit, Yongs yarn, Xino, Hua Sao, Yonggong matches, and Wuhe Xinhua fell slightly, and the rest fell by 0.5% to 1%.</p>
<p>In the afternoon market, Yong's yarn rose to 5,350 yuan. Credit was extremely tight, and No. 164 and No. 160 sold off, falling back to 5,090 yuan. No. 89 and No. 76 and others bought in. The National Bank did not buy much, and near the close, it was raised to 5,350 yuan. At the close, it was sold to 5,310 yuan. Mayar was the only one to close at the limit. Compared with the morning close, Zhongfa remained flat, Lian'an still stood at the limit, underwear and matches fell slightly, and Hengfeng rose by 0.5%. The rest rose slightly, and the unlisted stocks outside the market showed mixed gains and losses.</p>
<p>Outer shares lost their outside support yesterday, and a lot of holdings poured out, causing a significant decline. Although retail investors bought in, securities firms were eager to sell. Yisha opened in the morning at 11.7 million, starting from 11.3 million. Due to the small return from the Hong Kong telegraph, it rose to 12 million near noon, but in the end it was still threatened by tight credit and fell back to the 11 million mark at the close. Compared with last Saturday, Yeguang remained flat, Wheelock Marden fell by 0.5%, Yisha English Alliance fell by 1.5%, and the remaining shares fell slightly by 20%.</p>
<p>Government bonds were forced down by tight credit yesterday, and the turnover was only 3 million. Category C opened in the morning at 620,000, fell to 550,000, and then stabilized slightly. Compared with last Saturday, Categories A, B, and D fell by 50,000 yuan, Unified Category C fell by 80,000 yuan, and Category E also fell slightly by 70,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>Hong Kong Banks' Huge Deposits; Guangzhou Financial Circles Express Doubt</h3>
<p>[Our Reporter, Guangzhou, 28th] Financial figures here expressed deep doubts and disbelief about the Reuters Nanjing dispatch on the 25th, which stated, "Approximately 60 billion Hong Kong dollars of our hot money has flowed into Hong Kong. There are over a thousand Chinese in Hong Kong with bank deposits exceeding 10 million Hong Kong dollars, 10,000 with 5 million Hong Kong dollars, and countless with over one million Hong Kong dollars deposited in Hong Kong dollars." The 60 billion Hong Kong dollars is almost worth 12 billion US dollars, and the agency stated that this is only the figure for deposits in banks, not including those that flowed into Hong Kong without being deposited. It is feared that the hot money flowing into Hong Kong from China is not so "abundant." According to the agency's estimate, the deposits of Chinese in Hong Kong can reach 100 billion Hong Kong dollars, or 20 billion US dollars, making the number of bank issuances in Hong Kong far from being met. Therefore, it is generally believed that this news, in addition to stimulating the market and further promoting hot money to accelerate its investment in Hong Kong, is completely inaccurate.</p>
<h3>Exchange Settlement Certificate Fee Increased</h3>
<p>[Our Reporter] Designated banks in the city recently decided that the handling fee for exchange settlement certificates, which was originally set at 20,000 yuan per US dollar, has been increased to 25,000 yuan starting yesterday. The market price of exchange settlement certificates rose again yesterday. When it opened at 1.5 million in the morning, no one was willing to sell. Transactions only occurred at 1.7 million. At 1.8 million, a large number of purchases were made, and the highest selling price reached 1.85 million.</p>
<h3>Market Conditions in Various Places</h3>
<p>Wuxi</p>
<p>[Our Reporter, Wuxi, 28th] Credit is extremely tight, morale is low, arbitrage is unprofitable, and all goods have plummeted. White glutinous rice 16.39 million, white yuan 15.97 million, port indica 15.7 million, sheep indica 15.62 million, wheat 10.7 million, white wheat 10.9 million, flour 4.6 million, soybean oil 36 million, cotton yarn 630 million.</p>
<p>Zhenjiang</p>
<p>[Our Reporter, Zhenjiang, 28th] Prices in Zhenjiang fell across the board today, and the grain market is gradually returning to normal. Secondary glutinous rice opened at 18 million, and soybean oil fell sharply. The future market price is 46 million per 100 jin, a drop of 10 million compared to yesterday morning. Cigarettes fell by about 20%, and yarn and cloth fell.</p>
<p>Suzhou</p>
<p>[Our Reporter, Suzhou, 28th] Rice prices in Suzhou fluctuated today. The market opened with 14.5 million yuan for top brown glutinous rice and 16.5 million yuan for top white glutinous rice. Retail white rice was 17 million yuan, which was filled with secondary white rice. Top white rice was difficult to purchase on the black market, and the price was around 20 million yuan.</p>
<p>Changshu</p>
<p>[Our Reporter, Changshu, 28th] Credit was extremely tight today, and prices began to fall. Top white rice was 16.8 million, bargained white glutinous rice was 15.8 million, wheat was 11.3 million, rapeseed was 14 million, and special flour was 5.3 million. There was no market for cotton yarn, but kerosene rose sharply by 1 million, and the stomach was not smooth.</p>
<h3>Authorities Set Price Limits; Rice Market Transactions Still Suspended; Yesterday's Flour Trading Price Was Slightly Lower</h3>
<p>Due to the rigid regulations of the Social Affairs Bureau that food rice, cooking oil, and miscellaneous grains markets could not exceed last Friday's closing prices, and based on general predictions, prices would definitely exceed this, transactions could not proceed. Market customers were turned away, making trading impossible. The People's Mediation Committee still sold 6,000 shi of rice in the market, and prices remained the same. Sentiment was slightly weak, but retail prices remained high: white glutinous rice and thin indica rice were 20 million, and early rice was 19.5 million. Although the authorities ordered manufacturers to sell cooking oil at the limited price, there was no follow-up by the close. Miscellaneous grains could not be offered due to excessively strict restrictions by the authorities.</p>
<p>The price of flour was also limited to last Friday's price of 5 million, but there was no old truck and warship flour available. Due to the inspection of warehouses, foreign miscellaneous brand flour was released from households, and Lighthouse, Globe, Shunfeng, and others were all 4.98 million yuan, about 4-5,000 bags, but there were few monks and a lot of porridge. Bran was limited to 3.9 million, and there was some trading. Wheat factory prices opened in the afternoon at 6.7 million yuan.</p>
<h3>Bulls Liquidate, Sentiment Weakens; Yarn Prices Drop Slightly</h3>
<p>Police Monitoring Cotton Cloth Trading Makes Sales Sluggish</p>
<p>Yesterday's cotton yarn market was affected by the cut-off of outside hot money, the approaching end of the sixth period, tight credit in the market, and clear sales. Furthermore, due to the thorough inspection of warehouses by the authorities and the need to register all warehouse receipts, sentiment was weak, and bulls liquidated. Forty-two-count Blue Phoenix fine yarn opened strong, but due to the lack of vitality in the market and very little trading, it closed at 880 million yuan, a further decrease of 20 million yuan compared to the weekend. Twenty-one-count Double Horse also decreased slightly by 10 million yuan to 700 million yuan. The remaining coarse and fine yarns showed a comprehensive weakness, generally declining by about 10%.</p>
<p>Yesterday's cotton cloth market was affected by the close monitoring of trading by the police, and the market showed signs of decline. The market looked flat on the surface, but the raw cotton was still scarce, and manufacturers' costs were increasing daily, so buyers and sellers stood by and watched, and trading became less frequent. Fine Longtou cloth and Sijunzi Yuanbi were not trading. In addition, Wufu fine cloth rose to 21.5 million yuan at noon, an increase of 2.5 million yuan compared to Friday. Longtou B-character and Red Wufu fine cloth also rose by 1.6 to 1.8 million yuan. The rest of the Jinlian Miaowu and Leifengta Yuanbi had many transactions, and prices were also exceptionally strong. Coarse cloth, bleached cloth, and Shilin cloth colored cloth were also profitable. Outside the market, the asking price for Longtou fine cloth was chaotic, with transactions ranging from 22.5 million to 6 million.</p>
<h3>Tea Market Lingering</h3>
<p>Since the continuous soaring prices of red and green tea, the market stabilized yesterday. The reason is that although there are many who are seeking high profits, they are generally restricted by credit due to the sixth period, and there are many who come to sell. Therefore, the process showed that it was difficult to improve further. The final result was lingering. Prices did not differ from the end of last week, but as for trading, in addition to exporters still being afraid of high prices for export tea and their stomachs being congested, local and rural customers were trying to depress prices to make inroads.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Food Announces Newly Revised Food Collateral Loan Measures</h3>
<p>[Our Reporter] The Ministry of Food previously formulated and implemented the "Principles and Methods for Handling Food Collateral Loans" for nearly a year. According to reports from various parties, the original methods had overly complicated procedures, and grain merchants were unwilling to apply for loans, so they were not effective. The Ministry also simplified the handling procedures to facilitate implementation. After consulting various opinions, the Ministry of Food revised the original principles and implementation methods into "Methods for Handling Food Collateral Loans," and sought the consent of the Joint Treasury for approval. Subsequently, the 365th Board Meeting of the Joint Treasury resolved to approve the amended proposal and abolish the original principles and implementation methods. In addition to responding to the Ministry of Food, the Joint Treasury also telegraphed the national banks for reference. The revised "Methods for Handling Food Collateral Loans" are listed below:</p>
<p>(1) The Ministry of Food has specially consulted with the Joint Treasury to formulate these methods to promote food circulation, adjust surpluses and deficits, and enrich food reserves.</p>
<p>(2) Grain merchants applying for food collateral loans must have the following qualifications:</p>
<p>1. Grain merchants who are registered and qualified in accordance with the "Grain Merchant Registration Rules" and have a grain merchant business license issued by the Ministry of Food to engage in procurement, transportation, and sales.</p>
<p>2. Members of the local grain industry association.</p>
<p>3. Those with sufficient capital and outstanding credit.</p>
<p>(3) When applying for collateral loans, local grain merchants should, by the local grain administration authority, together with the joint treasury sub-office or its designated bank and other relevant authorities, based on local food supply and demand, grain purchasing and transportation plans, and the speed of the collateral loan amount, submit a report to the Ministry of Food and the Joint Treasury for approval.</p>
<p>(4) When grain merchants apply to the national banks for collateral loans by purchasing and storing grain, the warehouse where the collateral grain is stored should be inspected and approved by the bank.</p>
<p>(5) All collateral loan procedures, guarantee matters, deadlines, and interest rates for local grain merchants handling food collateral loans should be handled in accordance with the regulations of the local national banks undertaking the work (if necessary, the procedures may be simplified, the interest rates may be reduced, the deadlines may be extended, and the collateral loan amount may be relaxed, taking into account the actual situation).</p>

Those present included Zhu Jingnong, Ou Yuanhuai, Chu Zhaoyi, Wang Yukai, Shen Sizhuang, Situ Bo, Chen Mengyu, Sun Ruilin, Hu Wenjun, Li Peien, Pan Xulun, Chen Gaoyong, Liu Haisu, and over twenty others, with Wang Yukai presiding. During the session, Presidents Zhu Jingnong and Ou Yuanhuai reported on the progress of negotiations for "Guanghua" and "Datong" to become national universities. Both schools have begun summer vacation from today. Subsequently, President Hu Dunfu reported that the Ministry of Health has allowed private universities to purchase needed medical supplies at reduced prices directly from the Ministry's drug supply office; in addition, the China International Relief Committee can also apply for subsidized drugs free of charge. The following items were then discussed and decided: (1) The government is requested to continue providing unified scholarships for impoverished students in Shanghai. Zhu Jingnong, Ou Yuanhuai, Wang Yukai, and Hu Dunfu were designated to convene with Jiaotong University President Li Zhaohuan and Fudan University President Zhang Yi to visit Mayor Wu to discuss all matters in person. (2) The opening date for the next semester for each school is set around September 15th. (3) The next forum will be convened by Soochow University and the East Asia Physical Education College.</p>
<p>The issue of tuition fees for the next semester was also mentioned at yesterday's meeting, but because of drastic fluctuations in prices, it was generally believed that it was too early to make a decision. Discussions and decisions will be made closer to the start of the semester.</p>

<h3>Concrete Agreement Reached Between China and the Philippines; the First Asian Games Will Be Hosted by China; Memorandum Drafted to Be Taken to London for Discussion; Hao Gengsheng Reports on His Trip to Southeast Asia</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] When the Seventh National Games were held in Shanghai, overseas Chinese compatriots returned to the country to participate, which was unprecedentedly enthusiastic, fully demonstrating their patriotism. During the National Games, the board of directors of the China National Sports Advancement Association passed a resolution to promote and initiate the holding of the Asian Games. The newly appointed Secretary-General of the China National Sports Advancement Association, Hao Gengsheng, then traveled to Southeast Asia, departing on the 8th of this month, first to Manila, where he stayed for nine days, then to Singapore, where he also stayed for five days, returning to Shanghai on the afternoon of the 27th. The trip lasted 20 days and the results were very satisfactory. Hao hosted reporters from various newspapers at the Municipal Gymnasium yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM, reporting on the trip as follows:</p>
<p>Hao said: The trip had three motivations: (1) When the Seventh National Games were held, overseas Chinese compatriots not only participated enthusiastically, but the leaders of each team especially hoped that Hao could visit Southeast Asia for a tour, so it was decided after the games to make the trip to express condolences and gratitude. After the reorganization of the China National Sports Advancement Association, Jiang Lianggui was initially elected as Secretary-General, but Jiang resigned. Hao was re-elected as Secretary-General, with Jiang as Deputy Secretary-General, which made Hao feel it even more necessary to visit each of these places for inspection. (2) The historically significant Far Eastern Games were dissolved in 1934 because Japan insisted on the participation of "Manchukuo." It has been fourteen years since then, and it is deeply felt that it is necessary to reorganize the Asian Sports Federation, so the opportunity was taken to contact all parties. (3) The government only allocated US$25,000 for participation in the World Games, which was insufficient. Dr. Wang Zhengting instructed him as a representative to discuss with the overseas Chinese community, and any voluntary donations could subsidize the World Games expenses.</p>
<p>He was warmly welcomed by overseas Chinese compatriots in all the places he visited. This was because overseas Chinese students were deeply moved by the greatness of the motherland after returning to the country to participate in the National Games, hence this enthusiastic outpouring. Regarding the organization of the Asian Sports Federation, Chen Tangshou and he, together with the Secretary-General of the Philippine Sports Association, Yilanna, and the Director of Sports at the University of the Philippines in Manila, held a meeting. Both sides completely agreed on the principles of establishing the Asian Sports Federation and holding the Asian Games. The sports conference will be held every two years, and the games will be held every four years, interspersed with the World Games. The Philippine side also proposed that the first games should be held in China. The progress of the meeting has been drafted into a memorandum by Yilanna, which will be taken to London to discuss with representatives from Asian countries participating in the World Games, and then specific measures will be determined. Rumors about the restoration of the Far Eastern Games and the holding of the games by China and the Philippines first are completely false. The Soviet Union of Asia will be welcome to participate at that time, while Japan will be invited to participate after the peace conference and international recognition of its government. In addition, overseas Chinese in Manila, Singapore, and Indonesia have been very enthusiastic about donating to the World Games, totaling between US$25,000 and US$35,000, which will be directly remitted from each of these places to London and handed over to the World Games delegation.</p>
<h3>Tennis League; Union America Greatly Defeats En Pai; Union Friends Loses to Sports Union</h3>
<p>The results of the first day of the Group A Tennis League were: Green Light defeated Zhonghua, Union America defeated En Pai thirteen to two in another match, and Sports Union defeated Union Friends eleven to four. Despite the impressive lineup of Union America, it failed to achieve a complete victory. The second pair, Li Wencheng, had not recovered from his illness for long, and Lin Baohua had not recovered from his arm surgery, so their performance was mediocre, losing one to two. Ye Guanxiong and Li Guofan did not play because their opponents forfeited. En Pai lost all three straight sets in the third, fourth, and fifth groups. En Pai's incomplete lineup greatly affected its strength. Zhang Rongcai himself decided to join Bixun.</p>

<h3>Whitehead's Evaluation of Dewey</h3>
<p>— Li Ren</p>
<p>The late British philosopher Professor A. N. Whitehead wrote an article criticizing the American philosopher John Dewey. This article was first published in the book "The Philosophy of Dewey" in the "Library of Living Philosophers" edited by Northwestern University, USA, and later included in Whitehead's "Essays in Science and Philosophy." The title of the article is "John Dewey and His Influence." It is a short piece, less than a thousand words, but it explains Dewey's place in the history of philosophy. Therefore, it is worthwhile for us to introduce it. The following is a brief summary of Whitehead's original text.</p>
<p>Whitehead believes that philosophy is a broad and ill-defined discipline, but it has made many contributions to the development of human nature. Dewey's place in the history of philosophy can be placed among those who have shaped philosophical thought to suit the needs of the times. He can be compared to the ancient Stoics, Augustine, Aquinas, Bacon, Descartes, Locke, and Comte. The reputation of these people is not primarily because their particular doctrines are liked by later generations. Their reputation lies in the fact that as a result of their activities, the social systems of their times gained an enlightened momentum, enabling these systems to more fully achieve their possible lofty goals. Thanks to the Stoics, the legal tradition of Western countries could be firmly established in the Roman Empire. Thanks to Augustine, Western Christianity was able to cope with the so-called Dark Ages with a fixed rational tradition. Thanks to Aquinas, the ideal of harmonizing action, emotion, and understanding was modernized for the thirteenth century. The influence of Bacon, Descartes, Locke, and Comte on modern life is even more undeniable. Similarly, Dewey has made the same contributions to American civilization as the aforementioned admonishers. He has expressed great ideas related to the operation of the social system. The magnitude of his achievements can be estimated based on the future. For many years to come, North America will be the vibrant center of human civilization. Thoughts and actions originate from it and are based on it. We all live in an era influenced by Dewey. It is difficult to describe this era because we cannot observe it from outside of it. However, we know that Dewey is a particularly powerful American thinker. He is the main intellectual force, providing his environment with consistent purpose. Wherever Dewey's influence is clearly felt, his personality is remembered with gratitude and affection.</p>
<p>Although Whitehead regards Dewey's position as very high, he does not believe that Dewey's thought is ultimate, complete, or unquestionable. He believes that no system of thought is ultimate or complete. Regarding existing thought or knowledge as the ultimate and complete capacity is the arbitrary attitude of mankind. Skeptics and believers are equally dogmatists. The main dogmatists at present are scientists and skeptics. They may allow minor progress, but fundamental novelty is hindered. This kind of dogmatic common sense is the death of philosophical inquiry. We should know that the universe is infinite, and human power is limited. Dewey is never intimidated by novel ideas. However, all established systems of thought inevitably adopt a self-justifying capacity and inevitably refute the doctrines of others. Dewey is no exception. In philosophical discussions, refutation or criticism has a legitimate place. However, refutation or criticism can never become the final chapter of philosophy. Philosophy gradually progresses by introducing new ideas, broadening horizons, and harmonizing conflicts. These words are equivalent to saying that we cannot over-believe Dewey's doctrines, and we cannot arbitrarily reject new ideas because of belief in Dewey's doctrines. This is not the way to promote scholarship progress. In addition, Whitehead believes that Dewey's success lies in revealing concepts related to modern civilization, but the danger is that it can bias thought toward today's narrow scope. This danger is further increased by the prestige of modern science. We cannot be satisfied with the success of only popular concepts. Thought needs to go beyond popular concepts. This is what Whitehead calls "the adventure of ideas." In a nutshell, Whitehead praises Dewey with a warning capacity.</p>
<h3>Idle Thoughts on the Lake (5)</h3>
<p>— Gu Ou</p>
<p>Yin and Yang</p>
<p>Yin and Yang are two opposites that arise simultaneously. If we must distinguish between them, then Yin should come before Yang. Let's talk about the two sexes of men and women. The opposite sexes of men and women are naturally two opposites that arise simultaneously, but in terms of the general principle of biological evolution, before there was a distinction between male and female, that is, in terms of single-celled lower organisms, the reproductive function already existed. Reproduction is a characteristic of females, so it can be seen that organisms first have females, gradually evolve, and then have males, separated from females. Females belong to Yin, and males belong to Yang, so it is said that Yin comes before Yang.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the evolution of living matter from inanimate matter belongs to Yin, and life belongs to Yang. This is six Yin before Yang. If we talk about death and life, there should be death first and then life. Death is not only the dissipation of life, but also the incompleteness of life. Life comes from death and returns to death. If so, it is still Yin before Yang.</p>
<p>Lao Zhuang said that heaven and earth and all things are born from existence, existence comes from non-existence, and returns to non-existence. Life comes from matter and returns to matter. Culture comes from nature and returns to nature. Everything is like this. If we use the Chinese concept of Yin and Yang, we should say that Yang comes from Yin and returns to Yin. The Yin-Yang sequence is not only a matter of before and after, but Yang exists dependent on Yin. Yin can exist before Yang. Yin can still exist after Yang is gone, but if Yin is gone, Yang can never exist again.</p>
<p>The Book of Changes uses the Qian and Kun hexagrams to represent Yin and Yang. The virtue of Qian is strength, and the virtue of Kun is compliance. Strength is movement, and compliance is also movement. Strength belongs to initiative, and compliance belongs to following. Why not say passive but say following? Because passive is when object A is pushed by object B, and following is when object A follows object B and moves automatically. Initiative and following are both automatic, only one is before and one is after. As for passive, it is not automatic, but only moved by others. Now, in the natural world, from beginning to end, there should only be following movement, and no initiative movement is seen. Or it can be said that there is only automatic, and no other movement that dominates this movement or produces this movement. A follows B, B follows C, C follows D, D follows E, and so on to infinity, interconnected, pushing each other away, unable to find a starting point, unable to find a master brain. Everything follows, everything has no self-nature. In other words, it is everything natural. If you want to find a master brain in nature, if you want to determine a starting point, then that is the religious creationist theory of God, and you will never be able to jump out of his circle. Otherwise, nature is just nature, following movement is just following movement, one next to the other, one layer next to the other, without a head, without a brain, this is called infinity. Infinity is without beginning before, and without end after. No one can claim anyone else. If so, then all following movement is equal to immobility, so it is called stillness. Chinese Taoists have seen this point clearly, so the sixty-four hexagrams begin with Gui Zang. All things originate in Kun and return to Kun. Gui Zang is the ultimate and the most original. But if you name the Kun hexagram the original hexagram, then it teaches people to think that everything movement has a first beginning. If there is a first beginning, then this movement is definitely not following movement but must be originating movement. Then please ask, who is the one who masters this movement? There should be no initiative movement in the natural world. All movements are following movements, so connoisseurs do not call the Kun hexagram original, but call it Gui. Moreover, Gui Zang is not annihilation or completion. Some people think that life evolves from the material world, humans evolve from the living world, and culture evolves from humans, as if it is gradually evolving, never ending. I don't know that everything evolving still returns to nature. You cannot move forward even one step. Taoists have elaborated on this meaning, so the Kun hexagram is named Gui Zang and is designated as the first hexagram of the sixty-four hexagrams. Confucians do not advocate nature but promote human culture. Speaking of humans, humans evolved from the natural world, the living world, and the animal world, and evolved a profound culture from humans. What is different between human culture and nature is mainly that it has an initiative movement. Evolving from nature to human culture is evolving from following movement to initiative movement. Let's take the two sexes of men and women as an example. Before single-celled organisms were divided into male and female, there was only ceaseless reproduction in the living world. The ceaselessness of this life will and its perpetual forward movement really had a little initiative spirit, intruding into the realm of following movement in the natural world. It should be said that this little initiative spirit has been brewing and producing from within the realm of following movement in the natural world for a long time. But that little originating spirit of ceaselessness and perpetual forward movement is not clear, not vigorous, and still has more meaning of following movement and less meaning of initiative movement. In other words, it still does not escape the natural posture. Since males were divided from females, male masculinity represents more initiative. And female femininity only represents more compliance. Since there is male masculinity, the initiative form of life will is clearer, more vigorous, and more intense. This is a major evolution in the living world. We might as well say that the natural world is characterized by following movement, and the human world is characterized by initiative movement. The great principle of human evolution lies in striving for initiative. Confucians discuss people from the perspective of people, so they take the Qian hexagram as the first hexagram. In terms of the natural world, Yin comes before Yang. In terms of the human world, Yang should come before Yin, striving for initiative to dominate all the following movement in the natural world. But human initiative also evolved from natural following movement, and it has a limit. The final destination must still join nature. Confucians know this layer deeply, so in the six lines of the Qian hexagram, the first line says "hidden dragon, do not use," the top line says "arrogant dragon has regrets," and it also says "a flock of dragons without a head is auspicious." These are all to not violate the great law of following movement in the midst of striving for originating movement. On the road to creating cultural avenues, it is still necessary to not deviate from the laws of nature. If Xunzi's so-called conquest of nature is not the spirit of Confucianism.</p>
<p>Yin and Yang also represent gentlemen and petty men in the human world. According to the above theory, gentlemen are produced from among petty men, they still exist dependent on petty men, and finally they must return to petty men. Just like culture arises from nature, and culture must still return to nature. Therefore, petty men can intend to oppose gentlemen, but gentlemen always intend to lead petty men, and never oppose petty men. Petty men can intend to harm gentlemen, but gentlemen always intend to protect and nurture petty men, and never harm petty men. Gentlemen are produced from among petty men. To put it in simple terms, it is like flowers blooming on a tree. The tree can do without flowers, but flowers cannot do without the tree. Nature can do without culture, but culture cannot do without nature. Similarly, nature can destroy culture, but culture can never destroy nature. But humanists still regard culture as important and gentlemen as their responsibility.</p>

<h3>Random Talks from the Academic World (28)</h3>
<p>— Zhang Qiyun</p>
<p>On People</p>
<p>The Englishman Russell believed that the attitudes of brilliant minds towards society at the time could be roughly divided into three schools: the Constructionist school, the Radical school, and the Pessimistic school. The Constructionist school creates history, views individuals as members of society, and deeply believes that to enhance personal interests, nothing is better than dedicating oneself to public happiness. They are rich in entrepreneurial spirit, believing that there is much to be done in the world, and filled with optimistic and active attitudes. The key to their success lies in being able to know the past and the present, using reason as a guide, and applying it to various practical problems. Their study of ancient doctrines is neither worship nor belittlement, but a kind of understanding sympathy, which is the so-called critical spirit. The answers to any questions obtained by the ancients are by no means completely flawless and permanently unchanging. Regarding the ancients' arguments, one must study why they seem to be like truth. Knowing the past is like this. Generally, people who first propose a new concept are often too far removed from the times, and contemporaries regard them as foolish, so they are mostly unknown and soon forgotten. Later, when the time is ripe, some outstanding individuals emerge. Great figures in history known for new ideas are often second-hand derivatives of their predecessors. But their greatness lies in their ability to recognize the times and detect where the seeds they sow can blossom and bear fruit. Knowing the present is like this. The American New Deal, the British Labour Party, Sun Yat-sen, and Gandhi all belong to this school.</p>
<p>The Radical school is further divided into two branches: the Romantic Movement and the Materialist Conception of History. The Romantic Movement emphasizes emotions and tends to extremes. Russell believes that emotions are easily revealed and easily lead to trouble, while reason is profound and difficult to achieve. Emotions are individualistic, while reason must be shared with others. Emotions only care about the present, while reason must consider the future. The Romantic Movement originated with Rousseau. From today's perspective, Rousseau's theories appear to advocate democracy, but in reality, they often promote totalitarian states. Russell particularly criticizes Nietzsche's theories, stating that in Nietzsche's view, Lincoln is inferior while Napoleon is great. They only have universal hatred and fear in their minds, without universal sympathy and love, and do not know that the world is built on benevolence. Nietzsche's theories can be said to be a dead end. The demise of Nazi Germany is clear proof. Russell and Dewey both traveled to Soviet Russia. They both disagree with Marx's materialist conception of history, considering it close to theology, and disagree with violent revolution, believing it will lead to dictatorship.</p>
<p>The Pessimistic school is deeply disappointed with the real world and lacks the self-confidence to save the world. They wander without direction, with more fear than hope. Since they consider reform impossible, they do not want to actively do good, but only want to escape disaster and cultivate themselves. Pessimistic thoughts can be divided into four schools: the Protest school, the Skeptical school, the Hedonistic school, and the Ascetic school. The Protest school is misanthropic, deprecates everything, and believes that nothing in the world is satisfactory, ultimately becoming numb and indifferent. The Skeptical school is self-consolation for lazy people, taking ignorance as knowledge, floating along with the tide, without any achievements. The Hedonistic school considers themselves superior to those who act in plays, retreating from the world and seeking pleasure, but their flaw is ignorance of current affairs, and indifference leads to national ruin. The Ascetic school suppresses all emotions, with hearts like withered wood and dead ashes, only seeing gain and loss as floating clouds. The above schools have a common point, which is individualism and determinism, resulting in watching destruction without knowing how to build. Pessimistic thought is not the guiding torch, but the embers after the wheels have passed. This is a pathological state of chaotic times. Great philosophers in the East and West all hold optimistic and active attitudes, taking building the country and governing the world as their responsibility.</p>
<h3>Aristotle on Potentiality and Reality</h3>
<p>— Ziqiang</p>
<p>Aristotle, on the one hand, acknowledges the so-called form and matter, and on the other hand, argues that both form and matter are within individual objects, so he must find a way to connect them. This method is the principle of potentiality and actuality that he discovered. He believes that the formation of an individual object is merely an action of matter from potentiality to reality. The first condition is matter and form, and the second condition is a dynamic principle: potentiality and reality.</p>
<p>Having only form does not count as existence, nor does having only matter. It is only when form is realized in matter that it counts as existence; principles cannot exist alone, facts cannot exist in isolation. Principles must have facts to confirm them, and facts must have principles to connect them, for there to be talk of existence, and at the same time, to be the object of knowledge—learning. But how is form realized in matter? How do facts confirm principles, and how do principles connect facts? Here, the function of potentiality and reality comes in. The process from potentiality to reality is an active development. Not only is it an active development, but it is also a teleological development. How so? Potentiality is latent, and ability is possibility. Since there is latent possibility, then what is lacking is only reality. Before an individual object is formed, it already has the tendency to become what it will be in the future, and what it will be in the future is the purpose. The function of reality is only to promote the realization of this tendency. Within matter, there is originally the potential to form a certain individual object. The path from this potentiality to reality is a necessary one, because there is a predetermined purpose there beforehand.</p>
<p>Aristotle's doctrine, viewed from a static perspective, equates the individual object with existence, which is an extremely crucial point. Viewed from a dynamic perspective, the principle of potentiality and reality is also extremely crucial. For example, in metaphysics, the entire existence—the universe—is formed by countless individual objects from potentiality to reality; in physics, various phenomena are also manifestations of potentiality to reality; in psychology, personality is the result of the development of physiological, psychological, and other states from potentiality to reality. By analogy, the principle of potentiality and reality is universally applicable.</p>
<p>Aristotle's principle of potentiality and reality, at first glance, seems to be the same as the principle of evolution in modern times, but in fact, they are very different: (1) Aristotle's evolution from potentiality to reality has a predetermined purpose, while the evolution of evolutionism does not speak of purpose. In other words, it does not embrace a philosophical view of purpose, but instead carries a bit of a scientific mechanical view. (2) Aristotle only speaks of the evolution of individual objects, not the evolution of species. For example, from sperm to cell, from cell to small ape, from small ape to large ape, these stages are the evolution allowed under Aristotle's principle of potentiality and reality. As for the evolution from ape to human, this kind of evolution is not allowed by Aristotle, but it is the so-called evolution of evolutionism; in other words, Aristotle's evolution is just the meaning of one thing achieving the most appropriate state, and the transformation from ape to human is not the realm that the ape should reach, so he views it as an abnormal development, an anomalous state. (3) Since Socrates, logical argumentation has become the central problem in Greek philosophy. Aristotle originally wanted to break away from this scope, but unconsciously, he was greatly constrained by it. Even when discussing the principle of potentiality and reality, he could not get rid of it. The realm of potentiality is matter, the realm of reality is form, and form is the purpose that matter tends towards. This purpose is the standard of utmost appropriateness, most suitability, extreme completeness, and extreme perfection—in this way, it carries an ethical flavor. The evolution of evolutionism from one stage to another, the so-called other stage, is not the purpose of the previous stage, and has no ethical flavor. In other words, there is no goal of utmost appropriateness, most suitability, extreme completeness, and extreme perfection.</p>

<h3>Husband Doing Business Elsewhere Wife Immoral Mortgages Ancestral Property</h3>
<p>Shui Yunheng asks Mr. Pien Zhe: Zheng Ren has several legal questions and hopes to receive answers in your column.</p>
<p>I and my brother jointly own an ancestral house. We each received a deed from our late father, with my brother living in the east wing and me living in the west wing. I have been working in Shanghai since I was young. In the 28th year of the Republic, the house was mortgaged by my sister-in-law to a Mr. Ni (my brother was also working elsewhere at the time). Eight years have passed since then. Recently, I learned that Mr. Ni's son is also in Shanghai. When I went to negotiate, the other party only said that they have a deed to the house and that if I want to move out, I must repay the previous mortgage amount (calculated according to the price index).</p>
<p>My sister-in-law passed away last year, making the process even more difficult. I would like to ask: (1) If the property has a deed of division but has not been transferred, does my sister-in-law have the right to dispose of it without my consent? (2) If the contract held by the other party is not signed by the owner, is it legally valid? (3) If the other party extorts a large amount of compensation, how should I respond? (4) If the other party refuses to concede, can I sue according to the law? (5) Can matters in other provinces be sued in the Shanghai court, and will the court accept it? (6) I am unable to hire a lawyer. How should I sue? (7) If I lose the case and cannot afford all the litigation costs, what will be the consequences? (8) Because my workplace does not allow me to take leave, and the Shanghai court does not accept the lawsuit, what should I do?</p>
<p>[Answer by Lawyer Chuan Kuangsu] (1) If a jointly owned property has been divided, and the certificate of the jointly owned property has not been changed for the rights registration, and a third person mortgages the jointly owned property, then of course it is unauthorized disposal. (2) Invalid. (4) There are no clear provisions in the law. Possible. (5) Impossible. (6) You can apply to the original county's bar association for pro bono assistance. (7) After the judgment is final, the winning party can apply to the court for a ruling that the losing party pay the litigation costs. (8) You can entrust an agent to file a civil lawsuit with the original county's local court.</p>

<p>Pan Junjun: Regarding the procedure for obtaining an ID card, please inquire with the Bao Office.</p>
<p>Yu Huamin, Hu Rongxin: Your letters have no address and have been filed after inquiry. No reply.</p>
<p>Sun Yongchun: Your letter has been forwarded to the Shanghai Military Service Association, which replied that if what you stated is true, you can postpone conscription. After review, the association will issue a public notice to the relevant district.</p>
<p>Wang Renda, Liu Quande, He Naiyan, Ma Tianxiao, Wang Quansheng, Wang Heming, and the Funing Natives Association in Xiyi: Your letters have been forwarded to the relevant authorities for review.</p>
<p>Wang Shangde, Zhu Dashi from Pudong: Regarding your inquiries, I believe that you should seek medical diagnosis and take medicine according to the doctor's prescription. Even if the description of your illness in the letter is extremely detailed, it is still not as accurate as seeing it in person; and the exchange of letters takes time, and the illness may change. If I were to answer based on that, it would be difficult to ensure accuracy, so asking about illness through correspondence is not a proper method. Furthermore, over-the-counter medications and so-called secret recipes should not be tried rashly, lest they delay the opportunity for treatment.</p>
<p>To a Reader: A reader, Mr. Bao, recently requested the April 3rd and May 7th issues of this newspaper. I am grateful for your willingness to part with them. I have already forwarded them to Mr. Bao and would like to express my gratitude here!</p>

<h3>On Thrift</h3>
<p>— Wu Yong</p>
<p>If the rich hoard wealth and do not use it, then the poor will have no way to make a living.</p>
<p>This saying is correct. For example, if a young master spends a little money on dancing, so that the dancers can make a living, it is still a way to facilitate economic circulation.</p>
<p>Therefore, some people infer that the more wasteful things are, the better, saying that waste has the effect of averaging wealth and relieving unemployment. In fact, if the averaging of wealth and the relief of unemployment rely on wasteful means to achieve, thinking carefully, the matter is extremely sad.</p>
<p>During the New Economic Era implemented by American President Roosevelt, the government spared no effort to design unnecessary construction projects to alleviate the suffering of unemployed workers. However, the source of workers' suffering lies in not having income, not in not having work to do. If the goal is to relieve the suffering of workers, then simply giving money to the workers would suffice. Why build unnecessary projects, which both harm wealth and burden the people? If workers are afraid of not having work to do, they can simply move broken bricks and rubble from outdoors to indoors. If they feel it is not enough, they can even move them upstairs, and then move them back down, move them outdoors, and move them repeatedly, imitating what Tao Kan did.</p>
<p>The way to solve the unemployment problem must not rely on waste, creating something from nothing and artificially adding positions. "Labor is not the best gift that employers can give to workers. Hard work, toiling and sweating, is not a pleasant thing in itself. In today's civilized century, reducing this kind of hard work is the right thing to do."</p>
<p>Labor itself is not the ideal goal of life; waste cannot benefit the national economy and the people's livelihood. If the words of the proponents of waste were true, then to take them to the extreme, we should devote ourselves to destruction, "because construction comes after destruction." We must first do the work of destruction, and then everyone can be bustling and lively, with work to do and food to eat. Accordingly, bandits are the benefactors of the police; without bandits and villains, what use are the police? Socialites who spend lavishly on living expenses and are ashamed to be seen wearing the same dress twice should be considered meritorious figures in supporting a country's production. To extend this further, we may as well break all the window glass in the room, leaving not a single piece intact. In this way, glass manufacturers will not be forced to close down, and with the prosperity of their business, factories will expand and workers will be added, unemployment will be reduced, and production will increase. The construction of new factories and the purchase of new equipment will affect and promote other industries, and promote the industrialization of the whole country. According to this, healthy people must be made to get sick, and sick people must be made to die early, so that the medical profession can flourish and the undertakers' doors can be filled with customers.</p>
<p>What is strange is that the proponents of such waste are often the same people who are doing their best to advocate thrift in other areas. Today, some people, when it comes to education and cultural undertakings, immediately say that funds are tight and they are trying to economize. Thus, in the face of large-scale waste, education and cultural undertakings are the first to suffer the disaster of "thrift." In my opinion, even if we are determined to work hard on waste, we should develop it evenly, and everyone should give a large-scale endorsement, including education and cultural undertakings. Today's situation makes people feel that things that should be economized are being wasted as much as possible, and things that should not be spared are the first to be economized. Whether in ancient or modern times, whether in China or abroad, in the midst of the call for waste, the good things are always the first to be removed.</p>
<p>In the past, totalitarian countries, in order to solve domestic unemployment and dissatisfaction, did not hesitate to launch foreign wars of aggression to divert the people's attention. These examples seem laughable at first glance, but then they cannot help but make people sigh and throw down their pens.</p>
<h3>North and South Weather</h3>
<p>— Zizi</p>
<p>In the early years of the Republic of China, there were two students in the Baoding Military Academy who were very friendly. One was named Xue, a native of Hebei, and the other was named Lou, a native of Jiangnan. The two lived in the same room, ate at the same table, traveled together, and rested together, inseparable. They were like this for several years. On the day of graduation, they promised each other to serve the country faithfully, and made a reservation that if one of them became successful in the future, he would definitely do his best to promote the other. Then they parted ways. Lou went south to Jiangsu, and Xue continued to seek development in Hebei. Before long, Lou became successful, repeatedly promoted. Before long, he became a brigade commander, famous for a time. Xue was down on his luck, so he packed his bags and went south to seek a position. When he arrived in Nanjing, Lou personally came out to greet him, treated him warmly, and personally accompanied him at every meal, treating him like an honored guest, but he never discussed seeking employment. Xue repeatedly inquired, but was rejected. One day, Lou sent someone to deliver a note saying: "Although it is warm in Jiangnan, there is still snow." At that time, it happened to be early spring, and the winter snow in Jiangnan was gradually melting, and the homophone of "snow" is "Xue", which means that Jiangnan could not arrange a position for him. Xue was furious when he saw the note, and left without saying goodbye. He returned to Hebei and joined the army, working hard and achieving great success. Before long, he went smoothly and became a famous general. However, "the back waves of the Yangtze River push the front waves", Lou lost power because his superiors lost power, and gradually declined, barely able to maintain food and clothing. Helpless, he went north and went to Xue's house to ask for relief. Xue also treated him with the courtesy of an honored guest, fed him delicious food every day, and lived in luxurious rooms, doing everything possible to be rich and glorious, never contradicting him in the slightest, but he never mentioned seeking employment. Although Lou had plenty of food and clothing, he was fed all day long and had nothing to do. Moreover, as a military man, he was active by nature, and after a long time, he became more and more impatient. Seeing that there was no movement, he angrily resigned. Xue did not insist on staying, and held a grand banquet to send him off. Lou asked before leaving whether there was a place in the north that could be arranged. Xue only said: "My brother troubled your residence some time ago, and I am very grateful for your warm hospitality. I really feel uneasy. I have been unable to respond to the upper couplet proposed by you for a long time, but today I suddenly got the lower couplet, and I hope my brother can teach me." The lower couplet is "The high wind in the north of the fortress cannot live in the Lou house." Lou was ashamed and left.</p>
<h3>Waves Washing Sand</h3>
<p>— Chen Meng'an</p>
<p>The riverbank was originally for selling Jiangxin sand,</p>
<p>The front waves and the back waves sink alike,</p>
<p>The wind is urgent and does not follow the mud,</p>
<p>Accompanied by gulls and herons waiting for the sunny sky.</p>
<p>The tide is long and the waves follow the wind's strength,</p>
<p>The sand is flat, the night is long, and the moon rises,</p>
<p>Fullness and emptiness originally have nothing to do with human affairs,</p>
<p>But people's hearts are never at peace.</p>
<p>The rivers and seas come from the same deep place,</p>
<p>Some people boil brine and pan for gold again,</p>
<p>The ruthless are even more bitter than the affectionate,</p>
<p>Toiling for thousands of years until today!</p>
<p>Morning after morning, year after year, spring and autumn,</p>
<p>The sand does not increase or decrease, and the water flows long,</p>
<p>Unable to bear the gulls distinguishing the new from the old,</p>
<p>There are also boats coming and going with the tide.</p>
<p>Going east and then west again,</p>
<p>Sometimes high and sometimes low,</p>
<p>Foolishly hoping there will be a day when the flow stops,</p>
<p>In the blink of an eye, the meaning of red mulberry is always lost.</p>
<p>Reciting old scores in a new way,</p>
<p>Who knows when it was passed down?</p>
<p>If you sing this song again in the years to come,</p>
<p>Will it not be an ancient person's poem again!</p>
<p>Willow branches and Waves Washing Sand are all Tang Dynasty musical poems. When sung before the banquet, their rhythm cannot be restored. Those composed by Liu and Bai are purely in Tang Dynasty style, all seven-character poems. As for those collected by Hua Jian, they cannot be called poems. However, the fact that Liu and Bai's works cannot be called lyrics, and that Hua Jian's works cannot be called poems, there is something in between that can be referred to.</p>
<h3>"Hearts are Delighted"</h3>
<p>— Pingzhai</p>
<p>Every time I read newspaper reports about the execution of criminals, I can often find two stock phrases in the section describing the crawling: "Hearts are delighted, and the cheers are thunderous." Sometimes I can't help but think that a living person, tied up and kneeling on the ground, shivering, suddenly a loud bang behind him, and then "one shot ends his life, falling in a pool of blood." Society has executed the law enacted in the spirit of "killing for murder" - but the people who witness it actually cheer thunderously, which is really a bit like the crowd cheering around the guillotine in Dickens' writings. I think this kind of mentality is not very healthy.</p>
<p>Yesterday evening, I took my child for a stroll on North Sichuan Road. Suddenly, I saw a circle of people crowded on the sidewalk, and more and more people were crowding in. When I got closer, I saw a big boy wearing a sweaty shirt and shorts, sweating profusely, at most seventeen or eighteen years old, like an apprentice in a small restaurant. He found himself the object of attention of many people, and couldn't help but proudly raised his "magic weapon" - a big rat seven or eight inches long. The young man carefully tied the rat's tail tightly with a strong hemp rope, and he was holding the hemp rope in his hand.</p>
<p>He was smiling, and when he saw a car passing by, he immediately threw the rat vigorously towards the front of the car, but the gentleman driving the car had already caught a glimpse, frowned, and "braked" the car. The rat quickly escaped to the side with the hemp rope. The young man's interest seemed even stronger. He raised the hemp rope high again, and the rat's four feet were dangling in the air. There were more spectators all around.</p>
<p>At that time, I quickly took my child's hand and walked past. Just after walking a dozen steps, more than a dozen cars came along the road. Suddenly, I heard dozens of people cheering behind me. The rat's death sentence had been carried out.</p>
<p>I think "hearts are delighted" and "cheers are thunderous" are probably nothing more than this in reality. Everyone is really too depressed, so this breath of resentment is transformed into unparalleled cruelty, taking pleasure in watching murder and taking pleasure in abusing the weak!</p>
<p>After the Soviet Union decided to abolish the death penalty, the British government also had a proposal to abolish the death penalty immediately. At that time, Bernard Shaw and others also published various reasons against the abolition of the death penalty. But recently, after reading the news, the United Kingdom has finally decided to "try" abolishing the death penalty for several years first. And the American judiciary is focusing all its efforts on the work of "treating" crime. Crime is regarded as a kind of pathology, and far-sighted judges are using personality and educational power to enable criminals to get a real chance to "rehabilitate themselves." "Removing violence" is easier than "changing one's heart and face," but their "changing one's heart and face" work has achieved amazing results.</p>
<p>What about us? Let's not talk about anything else, "people's hearts" always have the opportunity to be "delighted".</p>
<h3>Zhang San, Li Si</h3>
<p>— You Mojun</p>
<p>The "Zhang San, Li Si" that we often say in our speech is the same as A, B, but it refers to general people who have no relationship at all, and there is no deep meaning. As for why it must be called the surnames "Zhang" and "Li", it is because these two surnames are the most common; why it must be called "San" and "Si", it is nothing more than saying that they are miscellaneous, so there is no need to delve into it.</p>
<p>In the autumn of the 19th year of the Republic of China, when I was teaching in Hangzhou, I was interested in visiting the reed marsh, and I went to Xixi. I took the road to Liuxia Town and took a boat to Xixi. The boatman was an old woman. According to her, the reason why Liuxia is called "Liuxia" is because during the Hongyang Rebellion, the slaughter in that area was extremely tragic. The only ones who were fortunately preserved were the four surnames and eighteen families, namely "Zhang San", "Li Si", "Wang Wu", and "Zhao Liu"; that is, only three families with the surname Zhang were left, four families with the surname Li, five families with the surname Wang, and six families with the surname Zhao, making up the number of four surnames and eighteen families. A friend said that she was talking nonsense, and "Zhang San, Li Si" had already appeared in the "Wudeng Huiyuan". I also said that the name of Liuxia was also there in the early Southern Song Dynasty, but it's okay to listen to this kind of unofficial story!</p>
<p>"Wudeng Huiyuan", I don't have this book on hand, I don't know what it says in it, and I didn't ask my friend in detail at the time. According to Zhu Xi's "Classified Conversations", "Like this crowd, there is only one principle: there is Zhang San, there is Li Si, Li Si can be Zhang San, Zhang San can be Li Si." This proves that the saying "Zhang San, Li Si" and so on already existed at the end of the Southern Song Dynasty. To push it further, people were already accustomed to calling people like this in the Northern Song Dynasty, and Wang Anshi even put it into poetry. Wang's poem says: "Zhang San's trousers are narrow, Li Si's hat brim is long; do not say Zhang San is bad, do not love Li Si is good!" This poem is quite popular.</p>
<p>Based on the above, there are two explanations for the saying "Zhang San, Li Si". The old woman of Liuxia in Hangzhou has her own interpretation.</p>
<h3>Reasons for Divorce</h3>
<p>— Jinlin</p>
<p>A woman in Paris is seeking a divorce from her thirty-nine-year-old husband because he is too childish. The reason is: "Since they got married, her husband has never given her Christmas presents, but insists on believing that Santa Claus will send them himself." As a result, the judge granted her request.</p>
<p>In Charleston City, USA, a seventeen-year-old girl is seeking a divorce from her ten-year-old husband because her ten-year-old husband is unable to support her.</p>
<p>In Switzerland, a deaf and mute husband is seeking a divorce from his deaf and mute wife because she deliberately pretends not to understand his gestures.</p>
<p>A man in Paris wants to divorce permanently, and the court has granted it. Because his wife's bedroom is hidden with thirteen statues of Buddhas as big as men.</p>
<h3>The Compilation of the New Chinese Map (II)</h3>
<p>— Fang Jun</p>
<p>The area covered by the 1:50,000 old map grid is roughly as follows:</p>
<p>Hebei: About two-thirds of the entire province in the east</p>
<p>Henan: The entire province</p>
<p>Shanxi: The entire province</p>
<p>Shandong: The entire province</p>
<p>Shaanxi: The central part, about one-sixth of the entire province</p>
<p>Jiangsu: The entire province</p>
<p>Anhui: Lacking the central part</p>
<p>Zhejiang: The entire province</p>
<p>Hubei: The entire province</p>
<p>Hunan: The northern part and the Xiang River basin, about one-half of the entire province</p>
<p>Jiangxi: The northern part, about one-half of the entire province</p>
<p>Guangdong: The entire province</p>
<p>Sichuan: The Yangtze River basin east of Chongqing, about one-tenth of the entire province</p>
<p>Yunnan: The eastern and central parts, about one-third of the entire province</p>
<p>The new map grid is based on Lambert conformal conic projection. Each map sheet covers 15 minutes of longitude east-west and 10 minutes of latitude north-south. Corrected by triangulation, the map sheets are uniform and neat. Moreover, the accuracy is also higher than that of the old map grid. If we try to draw newly measured longitude and latitude points or actually measured routes into the grid, the location of various places and the twists and turns of rivers can all match the points in the map one by one. Its degree of accuracy is comparable to modern international topographic maps. The area it covers is:</p>
<p>Gansu: The eastern part, extending westward to the vicinity of Jiuquan, about one-third of the entire province</p>
<p>Shaanxi: A dozen sheets in the western part</p>
<p>Sichuan: The area east of Chengdu, about one-fifth of the entire province</p>
<p>Guizhou: Centered on Guiyang, forming a cross, with each side extending to the provincial border, about one-eighth of the entire province's area</p>
<p>Yunnan: The western part</p>
<p>Guangxi: Lacking the western part, about more than half of the entire province</p>
<p>Fujian: Lacking the area bordering Jiangxi, about two-thirds of the entire province</p>
<p>Next, the compilation of the new map will be described, and I plan to state it in three sections: materials, compilation, and clear drawing, as follows:</p>
<p>The topographic maps actually measured by the Chinese Survey Bureau are mainly at a scale of 1:50,000. According to their nature, they can be divided into two types, namely the so-called old map grid and new map grid. The former was measured from the early years of the Republic of China to the outbreak of the War of Resistance. Regardless of the region, the width of the map sheet is generally 46 cm horizontally and 36 cm vertically. Therefore, in the southern provinces, each sheet covers less longitude, while in the north, it covers more. Roughly speaking, each sheet covers about 13 to 15 minutes of longitude east-west, and the latitude is generally about 10 minutes. This type of map sheet is not based on projection, nor is it controlled by triangulation, so the positions of the map sheets are uneven and must be sorted out before they can be used. The Army Map Service (AMS) of the United States has thoroughly sorted out the longitudes and latitudes and triangulation results of various orders measured in my country over the years, using them as the backbone to calculate the longitude of the four corners of all map sheets. This information is extremely valuable. Without it, the compilation time would be extended by at least one year. The Shen Bao publishing house has now released it.</p>
