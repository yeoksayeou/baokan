<h3>外電所傅蘇聯建議　政府聲明絕對不確　京滬和談傅說亦屬無稽</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿二日電〕牯嶺電，京牯間唯一賴以溝通消息之航件，以數日險雨航機未到，致使山間不得一閱京·滬報紙，廿二日天氣初晴，蔣主席偕夫人出遊，渠對兩日來京·滬間所傳和談謠言，均未知悉，尤對合眾社電，更未獲知。</p>
<p>〔中央社南京廿二日電〕上海合衆社電傳，蘇聯某駐華官員曾向我政府表示調停戡亂剿匪戰事，並謂蔣主席已指派高級官員，同意恢復和談云　，　院　局頃奉命負責聲明，此事絕對不確，純係無稽謠言，意圖擾亂人心云。</p>
<p>〔本報南京廿二日電〕關於合衆社所傳蘇聯出面調停中國戰事，外交部情報司長時昭瀛奉命闢謠，對記者宣稱：「此項消息毫無根據，所傳絕對不確」。另京中塔斯分社亦稱未聞此事。</p>
<p>〔路透社南京廿二日電〕此間官方人士對蘇聯之建議調處中國內戰說，鄭重表示，果有此項建議中國決不予以考慮，官方人士復不信政府與共黨間有恢復和談之可能性，若美大使司徒雷登昨日所建議者。某國民黨官員表示，共產黨旣已成爲叛徒，以和平方法解決中共問題之階段早已過去，其他方面人士指出，美援甚至軍事援助，頗有通過美國國會之希望，政府自然較前更不願與共黨談判。彼等復指出，去年莫斯科外長會議中，中國曾堅決反對蘇聯之企圖與馬歇爾及貝文討論中國問題，彼時中國政府認爲，中國旣不參加會議，不能將有關於中國局勢之事列入議程，然同一方面人士亦恐蘇聯之建議恢復和談，將增强中共之地位，後者在和談一旦舉行時，或將要求政府作過份的讓步。</p>
<h3>美大使發表談話　否認會作「國共重開談判」表示　盼我國官軍民密切合作</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿二日電〕司徒大使廿二日上午接見美國駐京記者，發表談話，說明渠對中國問題之意見，完全如前二日所發表之致中國人民書，其主旨在希望中國無組織無黨派人士增加對政府之關心，多協助國家爲人民謀福利。中國之憲法業已公佈，人民應在憲法之下，爲自由而奮鬥。　下午司使復接見中國記者，發　一談話稱：渠日前之所以發表致中國人民書，其最大的理由，乃感覺在中國之歷史上，過去卅年以來曾有光輝的成就三次，一爲推翻滿淸政府，二爲北伐，三爲對日抗戰，三次成就中，一方面表現其領袖如過去之孫中山先生及現在之蔣主席之卓越才能，另一方面，民衆均能結集一致發揮力量。在抗戰後大多數人民均感覺苦悶，徬徨無出路，而忽略中國今日已有憲法以確定國是之軌範，人民在憲法下，如能貢默自己之力量，即可協助政府完成現代之民主化的制度。司使又稱：當前問題乃爲最大多數民衆未能結合於憲法之下，發動新的革命運動。</p>
<p>大使繼稱：中國民衆在反抗共產主義之鬥爭中，已有良好表現，但力量均爲分散的，局部的，而非集體的，全面的。中國人民對共產主義之認識，則至爲淸楚，共產主義乃集權的代表，共產主義象徵人權的沒落，人道的喪失，中國人民對共產主義不但有頭腦，而且有見解，此乃不成問題的，其問題乃爲中國人民不能發現一條良好的，民主的，有效的奮鬥之路，事實上，此路即在我人面前，即憲法付與我人改革政治的權力。彼等祗有消極不滿現政府而未想到參加現政府改革工作，如何改革？最有效之辦法，即爲集合起來，其方式甚多，有人謂組織新政黨，但組黨必須有正確目標，爲國家民主而組織，同時，本身要相信可以反應大多數人民之意見，而爲民主國家奮鬥。目前原有政黨如欲繼續生存，而能有力量，必須爲大多數人民服務，領導人民走向正確之路。如有人問余（司使自稱），新革命運動必有人領導，其領導者爲誰，余可答曰：「蔣主席」。因只有蔣主席爲大多數人民所信任，只有蔣主席有才能領導大多數人民。目前之問題，乃多數人民未能參加國是之路，發揮公民權，如中國人民人人均可發揮公民權，則即可使國家煥然一新，繫榮安定矣。</p>
<p>〔中央社南京廿二日電〕美駐華大使司徒雷登，廿二晚單獨接見中央社英文部主任馮國楨，否認渠曾向合衆社聲稱：「中國問題最可能之解決辦法爲國共重開談判』。大使敍述其於答覆合衆社記者時所作之聲明稱：「余所吿合衆社記者之言，與余日前之聲明意見相同，余會稱，在中國目前面臨如此最嚴重之情勢時，凡愛其國家者，尤其曾受敎育之愛國人士，似有一極大機會與責任，以羣策羣力，硏究何者爲國家之問題，且喚醒並指導全國人民，俾使渠等得以實現民主政府，如是，智識份子其對於政府不信任之處，必能消失，且從而支持政府，謀致中國和平之努力』。大使繼稱：「余知若千人士對戈魯門先生（按即爲合衆社駐京記者）所提出之特別問題以前，均曾作特別之努力，然余不知其詳，余覺美國似係一貫希望中國能覓得結束內戰之途徑，余覺中國人民可望得一團結之道，並解決其各種困難，余並未說明係何種解決辦法，或如何解決之。美國之政策與以往相同，美國正予中國以援助，以期中國在或可獲得其他根本解決辦法之前，美援可予中國以暫時之紓解」。大使聲稱，今晨曾約集美國駐京記者，向彼等闡釋由於合衆社報道所引起之誤會。大使稱，合衆社記者已因誤解其聲明而道歉，合衆社記者自以爲轉述無誤，然其對余之聲明所作之推論，則絕非余之本意。司徒博士繼答覆記者所提出之另一問題稱，渠之所以特別指出智識份子與受敎育人士者，乃因彼等具有領導民衆之能力，渠以此輩人士可組一新黨，而對政府作建設性之批評，亦可僅成立若千團體，以倡導若干有關改革之主張及進步的運動。大使繼稱，智識份子及受敎育人士，例如若石干大學之敎授對於政府所採之消態度，使渠至感驚訝，渠願其中若干批評政府而未曾有所作爲者，應於新憲法之下，積極盡其責任，以協助解決國家之問題，當此美國人士充分注意援華間題之時，彼等期望中國能在其政府支持之下，發動一此種進歩的運動。美國人民對此期待頗股，俾其援助可收到其最大效果。爲求政府協助發展此種進步的運動，中國仍需其人民保持一貫愛護國民黨之精神，此種精神，曾充分表現於國民黨推翻滿淸，完成北伐及領導全國對日抗戰諸役。在北伐及抗戰兩役，全國民意一致擁戴蔣主席。司徒大使相信，在此種精神之下，進歩約運動，便可順利進展。大使繼稱：中國之共產黨問題，終必獲得解決，渠認平定共產黨，不能專恃軍事，政府應同時設法消除可以滋培共產主義之種種因素。大使指出，自各省政府以至各縣官軍民，三者之間應有密切合作。並稱：河北省因有此種合作，故深覺可以完全掌握該省局勢。大使稱，渠獲悉東北人民厭惡共產主義，故爲改善目前之局勢尤需此種官軍民之合作。大使云，渠相信，種種問題皆可解決，且稱，渠對中國政府一向懷有最高希望，並始終衷心贊助中國政府。渠希望明智之士將予政府以支持，並助其改進渠等所不滿意之處。大使未木及政府諸領袖稱：余對渠等懷最大之欽佩，其中多人余相之有年，渠等與其他國家之官員相較，實亳無遜色」。</p>
<h3>蔣主席關懷農貸　中農行擬就計劃　上半年急貸五萬餘億</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿二日電〕蔣主席對於今年度之農貸問題極為關懷，一月六日曾手令四聯總處，文曰：「本年度四聯總處應以農貸爲第一重要工作，務將農貸款項多列，並從速決定」。該處奉令後，即轉交有關各方從速擬具計劃。據悉：中國農民銀行業就上半年度急要貸出部份草擬五萬五千九百五十六億元之農貸計劃，大耍如次：</p>
<p>甲，農業·土地·金融貸款五萬零五百億，其中（一）棉花二萬八千億（估計收回棉花十八萬八千祖）（一）菸葉六千億（估計可收回菸業葉五萬祖），（三）糧食七千億（原擬全年度兩萬億可掌握三百萬石（四）普通農業貸款五千五百億。</p>
<p>乙，蠶·絲·桐·糖·漁等特產貸款五千四百五十六億，其中（一）蠶絲二一〇六億，（二）茶葉四百億，（三）桐油一百五十億，（四）食糖八百億，（五）漁業二千億以上，甲乙兩項共五萬五千九百五十六億　丙，貸款方式，糧食擬貸現，收購棉菸兩項擬採用貸現收實。　丁，貸款標準，棉貸收現部份擬侮畝廿萬元。</p>
<p>戊，貸款資金及利率（一）擬請央行先准透支三萬億，（二）以後轉質押仍照九折辦理，（三）農貸及土地，金融貸款利率，一律月息五分</p>
<p>〔合衆社南京廿二日電〕中國政府將以數達一〇，〇〇〇，〇〇〇，〇〇〇〇〇〇元（約合美金七一，〇〇〇，〇〇〇元）援助中國農民。這項建議係緊隨特種捐款一〇，〇〇〇，〇〇〇，〇〇〇，〇〇〇元之決定而產生者，寓有抑富濟貧之意。此項決定係由政府決定聯合董事會開會時決定，該會正副主席係蔣主席及張羣。</p>
<p>〔本報南京廿二日電〕據有關方面消息：春節節中央銀行委託各行局庫收購廠商成品，現已吿一段落。收購總値共計國幣三百廿四億元，其中煤一項即佔二百廿六億，其餘皮革。香烟·火柴等共佔九十八億元。至收購之成品如何處理問題，將由該總行決定。</p>
<p>〔本報漢口廿二日電〕湘北工業界爲解決工業貸款及燃煤配給等困難問題，頃推定李薦廷等六人組晋　請願團，並定日內起程</p>
<h3>四聯處理事議　審查放針</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿二日電〕四聯理事會定廿三日晨九時舉行特種審査會，審査廿一日理事會中決定之貸款原則及貸放方針，張嘉璈，徐柏園等均將參加。又該會並將於廿三日在滬舉行貸放小組審査會，將由劉攻芸召集，四聯有關人士已赴滬參加。</p>
<h3>美供我空軍材料　已在塞班島裝船　運輸機百五十架將飛華</h3>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓廿一日電〕國務院官員廿一日稱：根據十一月六日簽訂之契約供應中國空軍之材料，已於上週在塞班島裝載於若干中國船隻上。　根據十二月廿大日之合同，售與中國之運輸機一百五十架，將飛往中國</p>
<p>馬歡爾國務卿吿衆院外委會稱：中國已於二月十四日開始在馬利亞納羣島將軍火裝上登陸艦隻，國務院官員稱：夏威夷　餘物資及馬利亞納羣島之軍火合同，將迅速實行。</p>
<p>又謂：大部份物資已裝箱準備起運．</p>
<p>但售與中國之運輸機一百五十架，至今尙無一架交貨。　美國對中國反共力量之軍事援助，包括剩餘軍火及飛機在內，均巨額削價供應。</p>
<p>國務院已向衆院外委會送致備忘錄，內云：最近數月間已批准若于合同，將戰時物資售予中國國民政府。</p>
<p>此顯係國務院對國會　關於新提五億七千萬元經濟援華之批評所作之答覆。若于議員已稱，該計劃甚不妥當，因計劃並無供應軍用物資，所供應者僅有飛機用汽油及油類而已。</p>

<h3>馬占山等飛抵滬　據談東北形勢不如外傅嚴重　今晚晉京謁蔣主席共商大計</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕東北耆宿馬占山·張作相。萬福麟·張元夫四氏，偕隨從數人，於廿二日午後二時五十分，自平搭中國航空公司空中霸王號專機飛滬，於六時零五分抵達龍華機塲。東北旅滬同鄕會常務理事史炳炎·史維樸及旅京同鄕會代表王德傅等均往機塲歡迎。馬氏等抵滬後，即由中國實業銀行行長傅汝霖接往本市斜橋弄該行董事會小憇。據馬占山向記者談稱：渠等赴京後，將晋謁蔣主席，共商東北大計，但並未携有如外間所傳之「建議書」。東北最近形勢，並不如外傳之嚴重，各地軍力均足以維護當地之安全。至於馬氏本人是否將再度參加策劃東北實際軍務，則須待中央指示而後決定。關於張學良出山之說，截至目前，並無所　。另據萬福麟向記者表示：渠以爲組訓民團，實爲東北當前急務。張作相則謂：渠離東北已久，當地情况不甚明瞭。又據張元夫稱：渠等四人預定廿三日晚搭車晋京，行前（下午三時）決假中國實業銀行董事會招待中外新</p>

<h3>陳誠接見作華</h3>
<p>表示東北局勢無須悲觀　　〔本報南京廿二日電〕陳誠總長廿二日午十一時接見鄒作華時，表示東北目前局勢，決非如外傳之困難，國軍一切均有預定部署，對匪軍之攻勢，定有把握遏止，並無悲觀理由。東北耆紳建議加强地方武力，政府已擬採納，詳細辦法正由有關當局硏究中。又衛立煌曾請鄒氏代向陳誠有所報吿，鄒氏已於謁陳時代爲轉達。</p>
<p>〔又電〕鄒作華抵京後，已先後訪晤莫德惠，劉哲等東北耆紳，交換意見，並定廿三日晋謁張院長，有所報吿與請示。據鄒氏語記者，此次來京，係就任戰略顯問委員新職，同時並應中央之召，與東北耆紳硏討加强東北武力辦法，此外，並無其他任務。鄒氏認爲東北局勢演變至於今日其接收大員觀點錯誤，實應負甚大責任。該大員相信外交交涉可以接收東北，當勝利後，東北人民正股望政府接收時和談積極進取，致匪實力日增，此亦給予共匪以發展之良機。現共匪在東北基礎已固，短期內已難將其消滅，但共匪欲由東北入關之企圖則決難得逞。中蘇不侵約自動延長</p>

<h3>省營實業之建設問題</h3>
<p>— 安仁</p>
<p>（一）</p>
<p>戰後經濟建設，千端萬緒，賞言之，不外國家經營與值人企業是也。國家經營包括地方經營，地方經營即是省營，省營與國營，互為表裏，互為運用，而後國家之各種實業，可以循序發展。最近廣東自宋子文氏主特省政以來，對於推進經濟建設，異常重視，於是省營實業成爲漸有生氣之事業。筆者願乘此一論省營實業之前途。</p>
<p>國營省營之實業，有其基本之條件，失此基本之條件，則國營省營之效，亦隨之潛消。國營省營之基本條件：（一）必挼最有利之途。（二）必爲國家與地方之所最需要。（三）必爲個人及少數人能力之所不能經營而可以獨負其責。（四）必擇地方最適宜之地點，而原料供應與輸出，有發展之期望。有此數者之基本條件，然後不論國營省營，可望其發揮最大之作用。可是有種種附帶之條件，不論國營省營，均須要注重者：（1）此種國營省營事業，其利得，必全部歸公，無絲毫遺漏。（2）此種國營省營事業之主持人與其全部之工作人員，俱能奉公守法，絕對不致貪汚。（3）此種國營省營事業之主持人與其工作人員，俱爲該種事業富有經騐及具有技術熟練之人才，絕對不致安揷私人，籍公濟私。（4）此種國營省營事業所得之利益，歸之國庫省庫之後，保證可將其資本再次增加新興之國營事業及省營事業，絕對有致移挪爲其他不生產之事業。（5）此種國營省營之事業，以其所得之純利益一部分，爲增加國民之各種幸福利益而指定用途，不致套換爲官僚資本，危害國營省營將來事業之發展。（6）此種國營之事業，雖不專以營利爲目的，而取得之利益，乃是增加消費者之利益。（7）此種國營省營之事業，務官管理嚴密，開支節省，避除官僚作風，官僚習氣，人事專業，不苟更動。以上七點，皆爲國營省營應一該極端注重之附帶條件。苟能於此七種之附帶條件，一一切實做到，然後可爲吾國公營事業之前途祝。苟公營事業而與此七種之附帶條件背道而馳，則其前途將不旋踵而陷於失敗之地也。</p>
<p>（二）</p>
<p>省營實業與民營實業，當如何劃分，此為目前頗不易解決之問題。（一）從節制資本的方面言之：民營實業極度發展，國家茍採取放任政策，一任民營之自由馳驊，則將陷於資本主義之途轍而不能改易。故省營實業當從節制資本着眼，對大規模之實業，發揮地方資本之威力而擴張之，不致爲民營實業之過度擴張，而資本與富力之集中於一隅也。（二）從中國戰後之經濟建設言之：戰爭八年受日本侵略主義之害毒，人民資本力與生產力，受樊大之打擊，騰　　的人民，大　　為小　，小　　　赤貧。人民十分之八，巳陷於饑餓綫上而冀其能擔負戰後經濟建設之責任，目前不易做到。筆者之意，不論國營省營，當負戰後經濟建設之重任，值大衆人民元氣稍蘇　後，把許冬公營實業，以其小規模之部合讓渡民營，而後本末不致例置。（三）從扶植人民之實業言之；一切實定與新興之事業，都由國營省營，雖爲發展國家資本，但究非國家之資力所及，而且在國家今日各種實定落後情况中，即有資力，亦所不能做到之事。吾人爲顧及戰後各種實業之建設起見，國家資本與人民資本，均須同時擴充而後可併力以赴也。如何扶植人民之資本，以補公營事業之所不逮？鄙意以爲給人民以各種興建實業之便利，　實力之保護，一方吸收僑資，使華僑資本能集中於各種實業之發展，一方吸收人民游資，使其不向投機囤積及不生產之途邁進，而趨向於實業建設之路。此則有賴於政府之善意領導者也。（四）從公營（省營）實業之發展方面言之：各地方宜從現有之實業，加以內部之整理，使其能堅強基礎，不致半途而廢，又當將現在有希望之新興實業，讓出其一部分之股本爲僑股商股所購買，將其收拾之資本，由省營另建新廠，層出不窮，而後經濟建設可以達到所期之目的。此則爲推陳出新之法，又為暗渡陳倉之法也。（五）從官僚資本之取締方面言之：官僚資本所經營之企業公司，非公營又非民營，而爲變相之畸形經濟發展現象。蓋此等公司，表而或有似於官營，或有類於民營，而為兩不像之經濟形態。誠以官僚資本，借國營公營之招脾作掩護，以其政治之壓力，壟斷通商口岸之商務實業或配給物資，至於私人商行之欲以合法手續，輸入輕重工業器財物資，其進口許可證及結匯之請求，多被擱置。此則凡欲發展國家資本及地方資本以興建民生實業者所不宜忽視者也。</p>
<p>（三）</p>
<p>從行政院頒布之省營企業整理辦法言之：行政院於去年（三十六年）十月卅日頒布之各省省營企業整理辦法，就管見所及，目前是不贊成省政府經營各種企業，即刻售與民營，而必須採取以上所云之第四點辦法。蓋目前人民所受戰後經濟之混亂一般情形，影響甚巨，即右資力者，亦未必肯將企業之某種類全部承受，即承受之，其管理分配之計劃如何，工作人員之經騐與技術如何，未必能一一應付，將目前經營有效之企業而繼續發展之。如以其一部分股票讓人民購買，官民合力經營，而取得共同之步驟。併力之合作，則發展可拭目以待也。現在我談及廣東省營實業之建設問題。廣東省營之實業大槪多趨重工業。廣東僻處海隅，與世界之交通較早，新興工業，本　高出　其他各省之上，惟其實不然，與江浙諸省比較，瞠平其後。據佔計本省民營工廠有二千餘家，多屬技術幼稚之小型手工廠，設備簡陋，不足稱大規模之工業。年來因經濟不景氣之影響，倒閉者已達半數，其殘存者亦陷於困難。至本省關營工　原有二十八家，小營工廠亦有九家，但均因缺乏機械與原料，前者停工出售者，各計有三家，後者能勉强支持者，僅有二家。　州去年十月間原有紡織廠三百餘家，現僅有二百餘家；捲烟廠復　之初有一百九十二家，現僅有六家；橡膠廠於去年二月計有規模較大者三十餘家，家庭手工業約二百餘家，現僅有前者二十家左右。可知本省工業於復員後，曾一時復興，其後則漸次衰落。塞於以上統計數目，可知廣東工業之現狀，當發展省營而建設各種工業，並負政府力量，補勵民營大小工業之　。</p>
<p>（四）</p>
<p>以後，廣東公營事業現已復工者，有建設　轄下之士敏土廠。廣東實業公司轄下之順德糖廠，紡織廠，飲料廠，製冰廠，釀造廠，機器廠等六家。此外在籌備中者，有建廳之化學工業廠。絲織廠，工業試驗廠三家；在整理規劃中者有廣東實業公司之廣州紙廠，梅菉蔴織廠，交通器材廠，印刷廠，茂名糖廠等數家。廣東新興之省營工業，其貧乏如此，今後　設，應對於現存之工廠，加以整理規劃：其產銷情形如何？其原料分配如何？其人工技術如何？其管理方法如何？其推廣範圍如何？其機器動力如何？皆當一一計及，而後可　人　其才，地　其利，物盡其用，貨暢其流也。</p>
<p>（五）</p>
<p>第一次世界大戰後，蘇聯於一九二八年起，乃進入一新的建設時期。五年計劃，不是蘇聯之憑空幻想，乃是蘇聯當局根據當時國民經濟之情形，經數千專家之考慮而決定者。在復興期內，蘇聯之發電動力及機械動力之製造，已有充分之發達，其中有所謂指導之產業部門。此產業部門之發達，在蘇聯當局看來，對於工業化有決定之意義。戰後中國之建設與廣東之建設，其發達之情形如何，在今後之復興期事業中，產業部門之指導自有其決定之意義。茲單就廣東之實業建設而論：筆者以爲製冰廠與飲料廠當全部售與民營（如人民有能力承受），將其資金移轉設備（一）廣東糧食產銷管理公司，或糧食產銷管理局。必須將全省各地之糧食及海外輸進之糧食，優先收買存儲，然後分售於各地之糧食商店與糧食商人，規定價目，爲之轉銷。在省經營之糧食產銷公司內已有許多物資掌握，然後可以言繼食節制，糧食管理，糧食分配，糧食旣可把握，趨於安定，而後各項物價方可不隨黄金外匯之漲進而漲進。（一）擴充機械製造廠。實業公司原有機器廠，此廠聞已撥入紡織廠管理，以　　　　　大量農具，此廠可加以分別擴充，成為製造機械之　　廠。蘇聯之工業建設，其主旨在使一工業落後之農業國，一義而爲近代化之工業國。蘇聯在一九三二年後四年中，機械製造巳增加四倍，如飛機製造，飛機發動機製造，化工機械製造，汽車製造，鋼鐵設備製造，冶金機械製造，採鑛機製造，紡機械製造，印鑄機製造，儀器製造，無綫電機製造等。戰後之中國建設，當以華南之廣東爲主要根據地。惟有注意此種機械工廠之擴充，然後可進入一嶄新的時期。（三）交通器材廠之創立。蘇聯在第一次五年計劃，預備建築約六萬公里之國道，舊路之改築預定爲百萬公里，但隨公路而引起之問題，即是汽車之需要增加。在革命以前，蘇聯未有一個汽車工塲，所有汽車統自外國輸進；因此之故，特建設莫斯科之工塲與耶洛斯拉夫（Yaroslaf）之汽車工塲，且進一步特建一汽車工塲；其中一切設備，均托美國福特汽車公司代辦，侮年能產生汽車十萬輛。我國目前交通機關之建設，一時談不到，而關於交通機關器材之建設，儘可各省分工製造。如一時財力不及，可托美國公司出資代辦，在各省交通區設廠製造，此則國父於實業計劃中吸取外資之意也。（四）食品罐頭製造廠之創立。廣東以產水菓著名，每年所產之水菓，不下十數種，祗以罐頭業之不發達，所產水果，以時間關係，不能保存悠久，至令貨棄於地　，而許多良美之水菓，不能藏之罐頭，遠輸國外，良可惜也。此則希望廣東實業公司最近宜設立以竟其成者。（五）肥料廠之創立。廣東每年出產之糧食不足供應，不下千萬餘石。此雖由於許多荒地未經開闢，不能盡量生產之故，而亦由於肥料之不足供應於一般農民之故。即有外來肥料之輸進，價値甚昂，一般貧苦農民，亦不能採購也。吾以爲廣東實業公司宜速設計創立此廠;爲廣東豐業　　　　　　，不宜認　　也。</p>
<p>（六）</p>
<p>上述　　，不過就廣東一省言之耳。其實我國爲產業落後之國家，使各省今後均‘能努力於新興實業之建設，則五年以後，依規定計劃步驟以進行不難邁進於復興之路。蘇聯於十餘年來，由農業國而遞進於工業之國家，其經過之路程，有許多可爲吾人傚法。蘇聯之新經濟政策，與民生主義之經濟政策相同，蘇聯以三次五年計劃，而國家復興，已追踪先進之各國，而我國戰後建設，自信亦可奮步向前，與之並駕。根據廣東五年建設計劃，其前提條件，乃謀鋼鐵之足給，而五年工業建設，以鋼鐵工業爲首，而利用瓊崖·雲浮·樂昌·乳源·陽山·紫金·信宜諸鐵鑛，以樹立鍊鐵基礎。鋼鐵生產有着，而各業母機子機之利用，自可以機械工業而繼承發展之。然此造端，固非易事，深盼主持省政之宋主席與負建設之責者，徐圖而培植之，此則不佞區區之意也。</p>

<h3>美對援華計劃反響</h3>
<p>〔合衆肚華盛頓廿一日電〕關於政府所提之五億七千萬元援華計劃，公私方面及報章，國會最初數日之討論，有一跡象已甚明顯，即該計劃顯已各方面均不討好。</p>
<p>前曾熱烈贊成援助蔣主席政府之人士，則認該計劃「極不切適』。</p>
<p>或謂該方案缺少軍事援助，或謂並無規定任何穩定中國幣制之努力，再則認爲兩者均宜注意。</p>
<p>另一方而前曾熱烈反對援助中央政府者，咸信所提計劃僅等於浪費金錢，渠等認爲在華旣無實效可言，則不如移作他用或存而不用較佳。</p>
<p>觀察家認爲，對援華問題並無生見者，現已爲各方辯論所蒙蔽，更不知所從矣。</p>
<p>杜魯門總統與馬歇爾國務卿關於該項計劃之聲明，此間認爲足以指出該項計劃係應共和黨之要求而提出，非謂政府確信此時提出該計劃係有何等好處。</p>
<p>馬歇爾率直吿衆院外委會稱：如國會不能同時討論援歐計劃與援華計劃，則可　開中國部份先行通過援歐法案，馬歇爾此言，使衆人就有上述之印象。</p>
<p>馬歇爾雖承認中國如無美援則政府可能垮台，使共產黨控制長江以北之全部中國，由於削弱美國在朝鮮及日本之地位，但渠仍作此種論調。</p>
<p>此言亦不能消除對政府眞意何在之迷惑。</p>
<p>另一方面，反對以巨款援華者，則提出種種不同之建議，外委會主席伊東要求美國以相常巨大之援華計劃進入中國，以控制全部局勢。</p>
<p>周以德及華盛頓郵報，對」國問題意見常一致，兩者現均同意，並以銀幣收回目前高度通貨膨脹之紙幣。</p>
<p>保守派之明星晚報專欄作家白朗，則未論穩定幣値之可能性，惟　請對華軍事援助，使其能擊敗共產黨。</p>
<p>郵報評馬卿證詞</p>
<p>雅爾達會爲重大錯誤</p>
<p>〔中央社華盛頓廿一日電〕關於馬歇爾昨於衆院外委會所稱，渠對雅爾達會議中就東北問題對蘇聯之　步，事先並不知情一節，華盛頓郵報頃予　　，指賣誰爾達會議爲一「重大之錯誤」。</p>
<p>並稱：故羅斯福總統爲使　　加人太平洋戰爭，而付出相當代價，而在「目前蘇聯與中美兩國均不合作之狀况下，此種代價，實使美國人之良知，深具沉重之感。蘇聯　雅爾達協定，欲使東北成爲蘇聯之殖民地，而不顧中國之權利。蘇聯在蔣主席目前之困境中，僅以緘默及毫無動靜表示其對蔣主席之友誼與支持』。該報引述某不知名權威人士之言曰，馬歇爾會於雅爾達吿故羅斯福總統稱，德國崩潰後，日本可於于入個月內屈膝，並稱：「在此次大戰中，較雅爾達更大之錯誤，實屬罕有」。</p>
<p>明星報要求馬卿</p>
<p>闡明對國共所持態度</p>
<p>〔中央肚華盛頓廿一日電〕華盛頓明星報社論，要求美國務卿馬歇爾闡明美國對中國國共關係所持之態度。該報稱：吳總統向國會所提之援華咨文，並朱能平息美國對華政策問題上所發生之爭論。共產黨與其他黨派之聯合政府，旣已在全世界各國證明不能實現，國務院是否已明察此項事實，而致改變其觀點耶？該報末稱：「中國國共間之協議旣顯爲不可能，則另一抉擇爲何」？此等問題，應予以明白闡釋，俾國會與社會方面獲有準繩。</p>
<p>〔中央社舊金山廿一日合衆電〕舊金山紀事報，今以「中國與一九四八年總統競選」爲題論稱：共和黨以中國問題爲政府外交政策可攻擊之處，總統亦爲政治之使利，而「對華晞有措施」，二者均似未澈底檢討中國問題，是誠不能令人滿意。對於世界和平之關注，遠較此後四年內白宮主人屬於何人爲深之美國人民，應要求兩黨負責領袖，有更優良之表現。</p>

<h3>捷克政局急遽發展　華府倫敦密切關注　東歐唯一民主國面臨厄運</h3>
<p>〔路透社華盛頓廿一日電〕國務部官員對莫斯科電台所稱美駐捷大使史丹哈特授意捷克內閣內非共黨閣　辭職之說，僅付之一笑。美官方謂美政府對捷克政局正予密切注意中，由駐美大使館隨時向國務部提供報吿。此間官方對普拉格最近之發展，極感關切。若戈德　總理之發表破壞政變陰謀，渠之排擠內閣非共黨閣　，以及蘇聯外次之抵普拉格，顯示東歐諸國中唯一未入共黨究全控制之國—捷克，將不免遭遇與其他東歐小國相同之命運。此間對捷克政治完整及獨立之維持，較對東歐其他各國尤爲重視。其原因有下列諸端：一因美國與捷克有傳統上的密切關係，捷克共和國之基礎，固係於第一次世界大戰時在美故總統威爾遜協助下，由捷克首任總統馬薩利克（現任捷外長之父）及捷克現任總統員奈斯，在美國境內所安置。故共黨政變在捷如獲成功，美人之反響，常較東歐他國之演變更爲尖銳。其次，捷克素被視爲東西歐間之橋樑，尤以關於馬歇爾計劃爲尤甚。捷克迫於莫斯科之干涉，雖示參加馬歇爾援歐方案，然此間仍盼捷克與參加方案諸國間之貿易，得在補助援歐方案的效用中，佔據重要地位。最後，此間認爲蘇聯與捷克之關係，至少在理論上，堪爲蘇聯所稱『其外交政策的目標，僅爲基於安全理由，使毗鄰諸國均爲蘇聯友邦」一語之考驗。事實上捷克在歷次國際會議中，莫不支持蘇聯政府之意見，其對蘇聯之政治經濟關係，均已足顯示其爲蘇聯之友邦。故最近捷克之發展，未始不可揭露蘇聯所宣揚的外交政策眞正目標之所在。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社倫敦廿一日電〕捷克政局之發展，頗使此間人士爲之關切。據觀察家稱，捷克政府乃西歐民主自由觀念之最後堡壘。共黨欲加以破壞，俾成立類似東歐國家之政體，以應蘇聯之要求，此種攻勢　釀而未臻成熟。此次猝然爆發，實因西歐國家加强國結，莫斯科方面甚爲驚恐，以爲時機不可失去，非於此時阻止西歐各國協商對德問題不可。非共黨閣貝仍將大舉反攻，但衆信共黨總理戈德華將以共黨及左翼社會民主黨爲主，建議重組政府。共黨在捷克之策略，爲欲爭取社民黨之同情，此點不難辦到，因過去二月間之共黨努力，業已博得工人階級之支持也。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社倫敦廿一日電〕外部頃接獲英駐捷大使館關於捷克政變之報吿。外部同時又接獲波南捷三國外長在普拉格舉行會談後發表之對德問題決議，以及蘇匈條約之副本各一件，此三項文件均已轉呈外相貝文，俾加硏究。</p>
<h3>捷總統力挽閣潮　籲請各政黨共體時艱繼續合作　共黨態度硬決貫澈要求</h3>
<p>〔路透社普拉格廿一日電〕捷克工人在普拉克舊市府外廣塲舉行民衆大會，於聆取共黨總理戈德華之演辭後，通過決議案，要求貝奈斯總統接受非共黨閣員十二人之辭職，並成立「沒有反動閣員的戈德華政府」。大會旋推派代表團謁見貝奈斯總統，貝奈斯當保證此次政潮後組織之新政府，決仍由戈德華領導。渠並表示新政府將爲鱗會制度下的政府，決非無黨派性質的過渡政府，共黨或其他議會中之任何黨派，均不在排除之列。貝奈斯並呼籲各政黨共體時艱，從事合作。</p>
<p>戈德華總理在民眾大會中發表演辭後，（演辭內容見昨電）即偕內長諾賽克同謁貝奈斯，貝奈斯後復接見社會民主黨三領袖副總理蒂美斯，黨主席勞斯曼·及秘書長維林。貝奈斯嗣即離普拉克赴西北五十五公里之拉那別墅波週末，在歸來以前，閣潮當無解決之望。共黨已召集全國工會理事會代表八千人，於星期日在此開會，以爲更進一步之示威。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社普拉格廿二日電〕屬於捷克共黨之工會及共黨，今日在捷京召開工會理事會代表大會，決定於下星期二舉行一小時罷工，以對政府警吿，並貫澈其所提出之要求。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社普拉格廿一日電〕貝奈斯總統與共黨間所有妥協之僑樑，目前似已完全中斷。共黨領袖戈德華於召集其所謂「捷克最偉大議會」之勞工人理事會代表舉行全國會議時，曾發表激烈而具有威嚇性質之演說，要求立即組織新政府，排斥全部右翼及中間黨派。共黨領袖之不妥協態度，巳使所有調停與諒解之企圖，全歸無效。戈德華於其演辭中雖未明言總統之名，但渠之言辭顯然係向貝奈斯而發者。</p>
<h3>捷共要求組織　清一色內閣</h3>
<p>〔路透社普拉格廿一日電〕戈德華總理領導之捷克共黨，今日要求貝奈斯總統接受聯合內閣內非共黨閣員十二人之辭呈。彼等以捷共主席團名義，由主席戈德華及秘書長史蘭斯基簽字，上書貝奈斯總統，聲明根據民意以及憲法規定及民主慣例，總統應立即發動談判，以彌補因辭職而引起之空缺。函內並表示相信社會民主然必能繼續會同共黨參加政府。函內復要求貝奈斯總統接受民意，同意共黨之主張，以促進捷克人民共和國更愉快的發展。共黨領袖另一致社會民主黨執委會之函，力言目前危機得由共黨及社會民主黨共同解決之，兩黨均負有使共和國和平發展及促進社會主義發展的責任。函中並指出接受非共黨閣員之辭職，乃解決危機之唯一辦法。</p>
<h3>倫敦會議今揭幕　法可能參加西德全併區　美對蘇所提抗議斷然予以拒絕</h3>
<p>〔路透社巴黎廿一日電〕法總理公署秘書長國務員阿培林，於今日之內閣會議後向記者透露，法國如獲滿意的條件，可能參加德境三佔領區之合併。內閣會議之公報聲稱，內閣業已通過外長皮杜爾所草致參加倫敦三强會議法國代表團之訓令。阿培林並曰，法代表團當特別注意魯爾國際管制及德國政治機構等兩點之討論。法國贊成德國設立聯邦國家，但亦並不完全反對統一的德國之重建。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社華盛頓廿二日電〕美副國務卿羅維特在廿一日遞交蘇駐美大使之照會中强調稱，蘇政府之行動，使美英法三國有在倫敦召開對德問題曾議之必要。羅維特宣稱，蘇政府未能遵照波茨坦協定之規定，產生德國經濟統一機構，則其他三强爲德國及歐洲人民利益之故，關於改組德國經濟必須舉行會商。羅維特稱，蘇聯之抗議，實際上祗能解釋爲蘇政府係財德國現在之分裂逃避其責任。羅雜特結論稱，美仍希望蘇聯參加四强曾議，共諜方法以使　國能轉於統一。</p>
<h3>蘆田當選新首相後　日各報多加誹議　謂與社會黨從事「黑市交易」</h3>
<p>〔中央社東京廿二日電〕據本日東京各大報所載評論與消息，蘆田於新聞界勞工界一致不良批評下，開始其首相任務。第一日讀賣新聞社論對其攻擊尤烈，該報以「天下第一醜惡事」爲題，對蘆田與肚會民主黨左派份子從事「黑市交易」，以求後者支持前者提名充任首相事加以攻擊。　文中稱：片山內閣之由，係由於左派份子反對民主黨之政策所致，今乃轉而支持蘆田，是足表示其缺乏責任感與政治完整性，反之蘆田亦對其兩週前切齒指斥之左派份子陸續讓步。文中對蘆田內閣大加抨擊，並表絕對反對之意。朝日新聞雖不若「讀賣」激烈，惟對政權未移交反對黨之違反憲法舉動，亦表示惋惜。該報稱：蘆田內閣之成立僅基於政府黨間之中實政策協議。每日新聞爲文奉吿蘆田，嚴格遵守此次政策，並謂其提名未得日本人民之擁護與諒解。時事新報及日本經濟新聞，亦均指摘民主黨違反憲法而與社會主義之政策妥協。在此種與蘆田不利之批評外，亦復認爲蘆田旣爲前片山內閣閣員之一，尙能繼續片山之工作，不至如自由黨繼任首相時，使政府工作突然中斷，當此國家經濟情形危急之際，政府之在大體上保持其延續性，可避免發生其他混亂情形。</p>
<p>〔新亞社東京廿二日電〕日自由黨自首相提名選舉失敗後，立即連續召開所屬議員大會，討論今後在國會中仍以在野黨地位對付蘆田內閣方策，同時，並決定不顧麥帥之反對，仍繼續進行保守新黨運動。一般政治界人士觀察，認爲蘆和此次雖已獲得首相地位，然其組閣過程仍有相當困難，而吉田在此次選舉中失敗，但在衆議院實力與蘆田相差無幾，而在參議院中則超過蘆田，倘吉田氏能振作其在野黨之精神，非僅蘆田內閣在施政上必須有所顧忌，即在將來政治舞台上，仍大有希望云。</p>
<h3>橋本欣五郎曾製造東北事件</h3>
<p>國際法庭已提出控訴</p>
<p>〔中央社東京廿二日電〕橋本欣五郞頃被控吿製造並煽動法西斯性質之事件，以擴張日本之侵路。按橋本欣五郞於張作霖被暗刺後，極力主張科用日本武力驅遂東北之中國人。此項證據中，表示彼於「滿洲事件」前，曾力主採取「積極行動」，其後彼曾煽動該項事件。</p>
<h3>安理會準備打開荷印僵局</h3>
<p>將授權調委會解決爭端</p>
<p>〔合眾社成功湖廿一日電）聯合國安理會顯將不顧蘇聯之反對，授權三國委員會，繼續調　荷印爭端，以期達到最後解決。蘇聯及烏克蘭均已抨擊殖民通　國稱，此等列强現正迫使印尼共和國接受單方面調解之協定，以便到達其帝國主義之目標。但蘇聯雖抨擊由美·比·澳組成之三國仲裁委負會，然尙不擬使用否決權。</p>
<p>〔衆社成功湖廿一日電〕印尼共和國重提加强聯合國仲裁委員會權力之要求。印尼代表吿安理會稱：荷蘭自簽訂倫維爾協定後，其活動仍引起不安。渠又抨擊荷蘭不顧常地人民之意見，竟在東爪哇建立新土邦。渠繼向中印兩國代表致謝，因渠等曾以亞洲兩大國之發言人之資格，同情印尼觀點。渠强調中國甚贊成三國仲裁委員會權力應予增强。渠警吿稱：萬一該委員會權力不能加强，則雙方可能不遵守協定。哥倫比亞代表聲稱：渠可能建議應强覇安理會對印尼爭端之直接責任問題。</p>

<h3>巴基斯坦退出英鎊區</h3>

<p>小事化大事大事再化小事</p>
<p>珍珠港事件之後，由於戴高樂將軍命令自由法國軍隊，强行佔領紐芬蘭海岸附近的法屬聖比安島和密克隆島的無理行動，我們和他的非正式關係轉趨惡劣。該項事件發生於聖誕節夜，當時總統正在自宮招待邱吉爾首相。</p>
<p>這些島嶼原在馬丁尼克島的羅貝特總督管理之下。我們已經和羅貝特總督獲致協議，因此我們主張維持聖比安和密克隆島原狀　主張獲得了保障。此項協議，在珍珠港事件之後數日，重行加以延續。十一月和十二月間，我們並就聖比安島上一個電力强大的無綫電台問題，和加拿大舉行談判，因爲加拿大和我們都深怕它可以指導德國潛艇的活動。我們同意加拿大應派電訊員去監督該電台所發送的消息，假如當地總督拒絕承認加拿大此一行動的話，我們將和加拿大一致行動向該兩島施用經濟壓力。</p>
<p>加拿大政府在十二月四日通知我們英國政府的一個建議，認爲這兩島嶼應由自由法人加以佔領。這個建議對於加拿大或我們自己都覺得不可取的。</p>
<p>十一月底，戴高樂派他的「海軍部長」墨賽里去視察在紐芬蘭海岸附近和英方一同在活動的自由國輕艦隊，並且設法使密克隆島參予他的行動。墨賽里到渥太華去徵詢加拿大政府的意見。加拿大外交部不予允准。</p>
<p>十二月十五日，英國外交部聲言邱吉爾首相認爲由自由法軍登陸並控制電合，較諸加拿大政府採取行動爲宜，後者是可能造成窘人的政治局勢的。外交部還說，除非事前獲得美國和加拿大政府的允許，不致採取更進一步的行動。</p>
<p>墨賽里同日去貝我們駐渥太華的公使莫法德，就自由法國軍隊在此等島嶼上登陸的問題，徵詢美國政府的意見。總統讀了莫法德的電報，並且說他並不贊成准許自由法人牽涉到聖比安—密克隆局勢的任何政策，於是就用電話通知了莫法德。</p>
<p>莫法德於十二月十六日把我們的見解通知了墨賽里。墨賽里對莫法德說，他覺得我們正在造成錯誤，但是他將接受這個決定。</p>
<p>加拿大駐華盛頓公使館參贊勞恩在十二月廿二日說，他可以通知我們一點，即自由法軍的任何行動，已被阻止了。</p>
<p>但是同時墨賽里和戴高樂通訊，後者命令他照舊行事。</p>
<p>因此，墨賽里海軍上將事前並未警吿加拿大或美國，於聖誕節夜在這兩個島上使少數部隊登陸，加以接管。我們駐聖比安的領事柏斯凱於十二月二十六日向我們報告說，墨賽里對戴高樂深表不滿，說他的行動像一個獨裁者。墨賽里說他想辭職，對戴高樂事前未獲美國和加拿大核准而向他發出片面的命令，表示抗議。若干時日之後，墨賽里的確和戴高樂破裂了。</p>
<p>在聖誕節日，我經總統核准之後，發表了一個聲明，指出三艘「所謂自由法國船隻」所造成的事件，乃是「這背有關各方所訂協定的獨斷行動，美國政府事前確未在任何方面有所知悉或加以允准」。</p>
<p>不幸得很，在美國國內和國外的許多有勢力人士，未能理解該事件更廣泛的含義，而對國務院和我因就自由法軍佔領該兩島嶼而發表的聲明，猛施攻擊。少有如此次要的行動曾經引起如此激烈的反對的。</p>
<p>由於聲明中「所謂自由法國船隻」這個字句中的「所謂」兩字，我們遭受了特別的攻擊。攻擊我們的人以爲我們用這個字，意思是在對自由法國人的存在表示懷疑，成者是懷疑他們是自由的，而事實上我們用這個字句的意思，祗是說「三艘假定是自由法國的船隻」而已。</p>
<p>以佔領此等島嶼的問題作爲媒介，我曾在白宮就我們對維希法國的整個問題和邱吉爾首相進行了一次直率的談話。總統是完全同意我的立塲的，當我和邱吉爾先生討論時，他也在塲，但退居在一旁，讓我們坦白地交談了一番。</p>
<p>我指責戴高樂是一個以無謂行動妨礙他人的工作者，直接違背英國，加拿大和美國早已表明的意志，措詞頗爲銳利。我要求首相勸他從聖比安和密克隆島撤退軍隊，由加拿大人和美國人負責監督聖比安的電台。</p>
<p>邱吉爾先生說，假如他堅持這樣一個要求，他和自由法國運動的關係將受妨礙。</p>
<p>我同答說自由法國人停留在這兩個鳥上，而我們又一無作爲，勢將影響我們對維希政府的關係。我重申繼續保持這種關係的重要性，因爲這使我們可以運用我們的勢力，使法國艦隊和根據地不致落入德國人之手，並可使我們在維希法國和法屬北非與西非保有觀察員。</p>
<p>邱吉爾先生同意對維希的這種關係，對於英國是和對美國一樣重要的。</p>
<p>我直接詢問首相能否做一些事情來阻止戴高樂派在電台上和報紙上繼續攻擊美國政府。</p>
<p>當邱吉爾懷疑他是否可以對戴高樂行使這種檢査時，我說戴高樂反對我們的宣傳運動，是由英國的資金加以支持的，假如邱吉爾先生能够以停止津貼相威脅，戴高樂很快地就會毫無辦法。</p>
<p>邱吉爾先生同意考慮我所提出的各點。</p>
<p>就在事情發展到這個程度的時候，首相到渥太華去，而於十二月二十日發表了一篇演說，對維希猛施抨擊，而對戴高樂則備致讚揚。</p>
<p>在邱吉爾先生發表演說的下一天，我送給總統一個備忘錄，其中我說：「我們的英國朋友似乎相信全體法國人是堅決支持戴高樂的，而根據我以及我的同事所獲得的一切情報，全體法國人民中約有百分之九十五是反希特勒的，而在這百分之九十五中，有百分之九十五以上並不是戴高樂派，不會追隨他的。這個事實對於我們北非的計劃發生直接作用，因此不將戴高樂的合作估計在內。</p>
<p>關於最後這一點，總統早就決定戴高樂不應該被包括在英美進攻法屬北非的任何計劃之中，他曾就這個決定竭力向邱吉爾先生說明。他覺得將戴高樂包括在內可能影響計劃的機密性，而會在北非的法國人中自動地引起反抗。</p>
<p>邱吉爾在渥太華發表演說之後幾乎立即回到華盛頓來。一月二日，我在白宮看見他，並且毫不猶豫地說他有關維希和戴高樂的說法，是「極有刺激性的」，對於我和國務院造成了深遠的損害。</p>
<p>我懇請他說，旣然我們對維希的關係，對於英國猶如對於美國一樣有重大價値的，因爲他自己曾經履次向我們承認過，所以假如他能夠「稍為說幾句話」，表明英國雖不願意和維希維持關係，但是美國所維持的關係對於共同目的是有價値的，這種說法，對於我們將極有助益。不然，我說，目前流行的美國正在直接違背英國意願綏靖維希的印象，將繼續蔓延。</p>
<p>首相對於這個建議，並不贊同。</p>
<p>我於是要求總統運用他個人對邱吉爾的影響來處理這個異常的局面。但是羅斯福先生說他已經做了他可以做的事情，他不能再有所作爲了。總統和首相的態度和他們以後的態度是如此相反，因爲後來他們兩個人都對戴高樂極仇視，並且一直是如此。</p>
<p>我當即起草一個建議的協定，在我認爲對於美國，英國和加拿大是可以接受的，而使自由法軍從這兩個島嶼的撤退，對於戴高樂可以同意。這規定美國，英國和加拿大將聯合監督該兩島嶼，而使其中立化和非軍事化。</p>
<p>總統同意我所建議的解決辦法。我們於是就向邱吉爾先生提出。他表示接受，惟以戴高樂表示同意爲條件。同時貝當已表示同意。但是戴高樂加以拒絕。</p>
<p>戴高樂從不同意我們建議中的協定，以使爭端消除。</p>
<p>最後，當因該項事件而引起的騷動逐漸平寗下去時，我覺得最聰明的辦法是讓這樁事情擱置一旁，直至戰爭結束。總統同意我的建議，因此這樁事情就逐漸縮小爲歷史的註釋之一，而在當時極有演成整章歷史的危險可能性的。</p>
<p>我們對戴高樂的關係，並未因該項事件而有所增進。在總統或者我個人的腦海中，無疑有一種印象，就是戴高樂個人對於這背他對英國的義務以及直接背反美國和加拿大的意志，應負其責任。我們認爲他個人的野心太大，沒有我們以前所想像的那樣可靠。</p>
<p>關於我自己，總統拒絕對邱吉爾先生施用壓力以澄淸因戴高樂與維希問題而引起的英美關係，乃是幾乎使我在一九四二年一月使我辭去國務卿職務的若干因素之一。我眞想辭職，的確用鉛筆寫了一張條子，提出辭呈。</p>
<p>或許在這裏把我們對維希的政策總結一下，是適當的。不幸得很，這種政策在美國國內引起了如許的感情衝動，就是到了今天，還有些人還是認爲一無是處，祗是最悲慘的一片黑色。這輩人中，有些人彷彿像若干讀歷史的人一樣，總是注意馬上的戲劇性人物，盲目地追隨他，看不到他任何過失，並且把拒絕承認他權威的一切人都當死敵看待。很奇怪的，許多英國人和美國人把戴高樂，看做聖女貞德（Joan　of　Arc），擁護他比一般追隨他的法國人還耍熱烈。</p>
<p>第一點是羅斯福總統和我對於維希和對於戴高樂的看法一樣。</p>
<p>第二點是邱吉爾首相也堅決支持總統和我所主張的維持對維希的關係，有時候艾登也是如此，縱使他們自己責難維希而使維持關係成爲困難。</p>
<p>第三點是我們對維希的關係，使我們獲得確鑿的利益，這就是在維希法國和法屬北非保持接觸，假如我們和維希斷絕了關係，這種接觸勢將完全被切斷了。</p>
<p>此外還可以使我們的代表留在當地，設法使法國相信一點，就是戰爭無論怎樣長，協約國是會獲勝的，維希法國不應該和德國合作。同時還可以把法國人對自由的基本槪念依然存留在腦中並且希望法國的自由制度將獲恢復。再者對於防止一儿四一年五月間以根據地和物資移讓予德國，亦曾發揮作用。這種關係，對於防止法國艦隊落入德人之手一點，也有影響。</p>
<p>第四點是假如我們和維希完全斷絕關係或者迫使貝常投入希特勒的懷抱，我們找不到出衆的法國領袖，可以和他發生關係。在外交上究全承認戴高樂等於在外交上不再承認維希。對我們的不利之點顯然超過有利之點。但是我們的確進至給予戴高樂以軍事援助的程度，而設法造成他爲一個軍事領袖和法國軍隊的將領，猶如他應該是的，而希望他在日後脫離政治的關係，而專門在戰塲上和德國人作戰。</p>
<p>第五點，也是最重要的一點，乃是我們對維希的關係，准許我們在北非設有領事，此點對於計劃和派遣英美遠征軍到西地中海去以及對於協助英軍在該區以東的活動，塡鋪了一條道路，留下了餘地。</p>

<h3>參會舉行大會前夕　招待徵詢各區意見　　二一七位參議員半數已報到　今晨揭幕市長報告施政</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕本市參議會首屆第五次大會，將於今日上午九時在塘沽路該會大禮堂正式開幕，十時至十二時舉行第一次會議，由吳市長報告施政。下午休息，明日下午二時起舉行第二次會議，為財政，教育，地政等局長工作報告，及參議員對財政，教育，地政等局質詢，與各局長答覆。迄昨日為止，參議員報到者計一百十八人，預料今日到會者將更多。此次會議有民社及青年兩黨參議員參加，共計人數應爲二一七人，議員席次將重行抽籤決定。該會秘書處已收到提案，截至昨日止計四十一件。市府施政報吿書亦已送交該會。</p>
<p>市參議會潘議長及徐副議長以本市各區區長及區民代表大會主席均爲民意代表，但因參議會開會時，限於時間，彼等無機會一一發表意見，故特在開會前留夕，於昨日下午三時，邀請各區長及代表會主席，徵詢意見，俾提交大會討論。此外，參議會並定二十六日第四次會議時，請各區長及代表會推舉代表出席大會報吿。昨日參加茶會者，除區長及區民代表外，尙有市參議負，吳市長代表沈秘書長宗濂以及各局局長共約八十人。</p>
<p>招待會由潘議長任主席，致詞略謂，本年為國家行憲之年，但因共匪作亂，故必須先行戰亂，表面說來，戡亂乃軍事，與實施憲政似不合，然而事實上要實施憲政，即不能容許共匪作亂，故不得不戡亂，戡亂實爲人民之工作。地方自治如何由訓政推進至憲政，希望代表民意之各位能儘量發言討論，拋開個人關係，爲市民着想，然後將各位意見提到參議會大會討論。</p>
<p>繼由沈秘書長致詞略稱，實行民主，必應尊重民意，今後地方辦理兵役，分配糧食等。皆將增加各區工作，實施也許有困難，望各位區長及區民代表提出，則可使市府明瞭而促進市政之改善。</p>
<p>紛紛發表意見</p>
<p>旋由各區民代表會主席及區長紛紛發言。新成區區民代表會主席表示，根據過去學潮，禁舞，工潮等種種事件，也許有共產份子搗亂，但視實際情形，則可見中央對於法令之實施，事前攷慮似欠周詳，致造成此種後果，故希望將來中央在未實行法令前，應先徵求參議會之意見。楊樹浦區民代表會主席要求三點：（一）市參議會前曾通過將在該區設立市立中小學，然至今猶未設立。希望能早日實行。（二）本區有後方第廿五醫院，當地地痞時常利用傷兵，無惡不作，請市府設法能將該院遷出。（三）本區由南而北支路均汚穢不堪，希望改善。浦東區代表因見報載戶口登記將交警局辦理，認爲不妥，請參議會向行政院說明理由，仍由區公所辦理。</p>
<p>不滿房租標準</p>
<p>老閘區代表對市政會議通過之房租標準，表示不滿，謂市府調查南京路房租較前高三萬或四萬倍，皆不確。根據區民代表會實際調査一般住戶房租，至多在一萬倍以下，即該區前次因哈同洋行不合理調整房租而引起糾紛，其所訂倍數亦僅在三千至八千倍，常局應爲一般住戶着想，不能以大飯店，大商店，大厦作標準。閘北區區長謂區公所常被市民包圍擾亂，政府富局應予合作，戡亂不應僅注意軍事，必須顯到民衆是否合作，希望增加人民自衛力量，增强保甲制度。此外閘北難民衆多，希望加以救濟。提籃橋代表請當局多多爲窮人着想，勿使窮人照樣負擔捐稅而祗有富人享受利益。該區若干地點水電均無，痛苦不堪。吳淞區代表以地政局指撥該區區公所地點遠在砲台灣，離鎭有三里路之多，極不方便，盼能指撥商會路口財神廟公地之一部份。尙有不及發言者，其意見皆由書面提交。</p>
<p>嗣由民食調配會任顯羣出席報吿配售食米問題。（見第七版）</p>
<p>末由徐副議長致詞略謂，此次參議會大會所討論問題頗多，如戡亂，兵役，治安，房租，加稅等，皆甚重耍。本八可先吿慰各位者，即一切案件，參會決予合理解決，即不能實行者，亦必秉公否決。郊區市民所受福利較少，乃因地遠不及顧到，並非市府偏袒市區市民，今後亦盼市政當局務必遠近兼顧。招待會於五時許散。</p>

<p>社會局顧問趙理斧，奉命調升社會局副局長，定今晨就喊。至原任副局長李劍華，調任市府參事。</p>
<h3>張曉崧有倦勤意　對征兵感覺棘手</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕本市選舉事務所定本月底起停止辦公，工作人員調回原機關服務，但並不結束。張曉崧近又有倦勤之意，據談：與選舉無關，主因爲兵役問題棘手，區防部已電令本市於三月底，須交出壯丁一千五百人；本月廿九日開兵役會議，對此將有所討論。</p>
<h3>石美瑜由京來滬　否認任特刑庭長</h3>
<p>國防部審訊戰犯軍事法庭庭長石美瑜，昨日由京來滬，據吿記者稱，審訊戰犯工作，法於四五月間結束，未了之案尙有一百餘件，正在趕辦中。石氏否認外傳渠將兼任特種刑事法庭庭長之說</p>

<h3>壯丁廿一歲先抽　將自下月開始　經費須籌千億</h3>
<p>昨據有關方面透露可靠消息，本市兵役會議，於本月廿九日舉行後，征兵工作，即將於下月一日開始，先辦理壯丁身家調査等工作，然後進行造册審核等手續，預計於六月底前征足六千，此次將改用抽籤方法，其合格之壯丁年齡，自廿一歲至廿四歲，先從廿一歲者抽籤，倘足六千之數，則不再抽廿二歲壯丁，否則就廿二歲以上逐歲增抽，至滿額爲止。現在成爲問題者，厥爲兵役經費，因去年經費共計一百廿億，本年預計每一壯丁之費用，如制服，食宿，慰勞，安家等，將達一千餘萬，則六千名之數，將達一千億，此實爲一筆龐大之數字，常局對此如何籌措，頗費苦心云。</p>
<h3>天目路拆屋限期又屆　居民重申前議懇請免予拆除　推派代表向當局繼續呼籲</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕天目路拆屋事件，去年曾轟動一時，當時因該地居民再三呼籲請求，經吳市長親往視察後，准予暫緩執行，延期至春節後再行拆除。茲限期又屆，該地居民以際此房荒時期，實屬無力遷移，故仍懇請常局免於拆除，最近特再推派代表向市政府市參議、會等各機關繼續呼籲，昨日下午三時並招待新聞界發表吿各界書，略稱：天目路（界路）由舊新民路與天目路合併而成，其寬度計六十餘尺，爲浙江北路河南南路三二倍。平時車輛行人，往還自如，視南京路，江西路，福建路，各路之交通阻塞車輛紛亂，有天淵之別。况於卅六年三月天目路北面已拓寬二十八英尺，遼闊有餘，故北站火車任何班次到達時，絕無車輛行人，擁擠之狀，此爲往來京滬官員旅客所共見者。若拆屋拓路之目的，僅在整飭市容，求壯觀瞻，則天目路所有諸屋，無論新建舊築，均中選以上，絕無礙觀瞻。今市政當局果有改良市區交通之決心與具體計劃，則拓寬馬路，應分別緩急輕重，先自擁擠之區入手，此天目路無拓寬之必要者一。且天目路房宇鱗比，民等依屋爲生，經營商業，設一旦屋毀，則鼠穴無依，轉徙是虞。而商店工廠即吿停止，失業是虞。學童無法轉學，失學是虞。凡此種種，足以增加社會之不安者二。復因共匪禍國，中央明令動員戡亂，並令簡約戡亂，頒行全國，倘非民生急需上無可避免之建設，一律停止進行。今民所居天目路店而住宅，有數百幢之多，其間不乏高樓大厦，値在數百千億者，一旦拆毁，損失綦鉅。民等一切固付之洪流，而市政常局不但糜費國庫，抑且違反節約戡亂之國策者三云云。</p>
<h3>潘議長交議案　請中央明確規定上海市銀行組織</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕昨日市參議會收到提案十餘件，其中有：（一）潘議長交議案，其內容爲請中央對上海市銀行之組織加以明確規定，如係官商合辦，則應依法官商合股，若屬省銀行組織，則亦須根據法令由地方民意機關等派員監察，而目前市銀行之組織，雖爲官辦，但並未按例辦理。（二）張志韓提：「請嚴懲搗毁社會局主使暴徒，開釋無辜，並請收回禁舞成命，以弘法治而安善良」。（三）虞如品提：「本市電話公司對電話用戶去函申請添設分機，每藉故稽延或音訊卉然，致延長通話時間，影響用戶便利」。（四）又提：「請上海電信局在閘北及四郊設置公共電話以利市民而同治安」。（五）王維駰提：「請政府以房地產爲銀行押款担保品，活潑本市土地金融以解居荒」。（六）錢頌平提：「請制止武裝人員以調查郊區建築執照爲由横加需索」。（七）榮鴻三提：「建議中央關於地方行政設施新方案應送由民意機關審議通過後施行，以資審愼，並應統一事權，以增行政效率」。（八）陳培德提：「請規定傾倒糞便時間，以重衛生，並請規定逐日收費數目以免紛擾市民」。（九）張中原提：請從速將視獻土地建造美術館」。</p>

<h3>為房客共謀福利　籌組房客聯合會</h3>
<p>本市自市政會議通過房租依指數標準訐算辦法後，全市房客因市府開會僅有地產業代表而無房客會代表，對此辦法認爲顯有偏袒，刻已聯合發起籌組上海市全市房客聯合會，呈請社會部社會局，准援江蘇省全省房聯會組織成例，請求立案，以便經常爲全市房客共謀福利。發起組織該聯合會者，有南京路商聯會及英商哈同有限公司房客聯合辦事處，餘興里房客聯誼會，慈厚北里房客聯誼會等十餘團體。</p>

<h3>希望發揚西北民族精神　準備建設新甘肅　郭寄嶠切昐旅滬同學共同努力</h3>
<p>甘肅旅滬同學會，昨假復旦大學復旦茶室，舉行茶會，歡迎甘肅省主席郭寄嶠，計到二百餘人，首由大會主席毛鴻磐致歡迎詞，繼由郭氏講演，要點謂：1西北爲中華民族文化發源地，其落後原因由於：（一）封建思想作祟，（二）人民自身不求進步。2西北地位重要，吾人當前迫切任務有二，即（一）要在團結中求進步，切實做到一切爲國家，一切爲人民，摒除自私自利的觀點，（二）要在困難中找出路，甘肅民窮財困，去年度歲出百分之九十二以上，皆由中央補助，雖然環境困難，現在我們正努力克復困難，發展經濟建議。諸如原由中央與省合作工礦建設事業，現由省府接辦，力求發展，而交通及水利建設，又爲建設西北當務之急。3甘肅省三個施政重心，包括：（一）平時戰時一體化，（二）分層負責，（三）加强地方自衛力量。郭氏復提出西北四大建設中心工作：（一）自衛（二）生產，（三）文化，（四）衛生。最後對旅滬同學提出兩點希望，第一，發揚西北民族艱苦奮鬥，勤儉耐勞精神。第二，切實注重技術學習，準備將來回鄕服務，建設新家鄉，建設新甘肅。詞畢攝影散會。郭氏昨訪粤省府主席宋子文，交換地方省政意見，暢談甚歡，旋即辭去。又郭氏原定昨晚夜車晋京述職，因事改今晚離滬。</p>
<h3>新創機動三輪車　式樣美觀駕駛便利　每小時行卅五英里</h3>
<p>本市因奉行政府節約命令，故對於汽車執照之頒發，以及汽油之配給，限制極嚴，西三輪車旣違反人道，復碍及市容，故亦在淘汰之列，惟以此數百萬衆之大都市，在此種情形之下，交通問題之嚴重，將日甚一日。茲悉本市南昌路利通汽車行王爾榮華昆仲與季連孚現創製一種動機三輪車，大致與普通三輪車類似，惟底盤較低，式樣較佳，（見圖時速每小時達卅五英哩，每加侖汽油可行駛七十五英里，駕駛極易，僅須五分鐘即可學成，管理方面亦極簡單，售價僅較普通三輪車高約一倍，所費不巨，用油極省，並不與節約令相抵觸，同時駕駛便利，不須人力，式樣又復美觀。聞利通汽車行因此項機動三輪車可解決上海一部分之交通問題，故將呈請市參議會於大會中付諸討論，希望能予提倡。同時據王氏昆仲云：普通三輪車均可改裝。其第一批出品，已全部由台灣客戶定購使用，若本市當局核准，則本市亦將見此類新型車輛行駛街頭云。</p>
<h3>義賣房屋建築順利　四月底肖如期完成　弄名擬均用義字</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕冬令救濟委員會義貿房屋建築部及購料組會議，日前在市府工務局召開，由工務局長趙肌康主席，報吿工程進行情形，及商討如期供給建築材料辦法。據趙局長於會後吿記者稱，房屋建築工程進行甚爲順利，可望於四月底前如期完成。義實房屋分建五地，造弄堂五條，侮條弄口加造看弄人住屋，爲謀謹愼計弄堂四周決築圍牆，並綴以精緻門證。爲紀念義貿房屋起見，弄堂名稱，擬以「義」字爲首。又爲標榜我國古有道德「忠孝仁愛信義和平」起見，弄堂擬題名爲「義忠新邨」，「義孝新邨」，「義仁新邨」，「義愛新邨」……等等。惟新邨正式命名，擬請吳市長主持之。又爲監督各項工程切實按照圖樣履行起見，曾組督工組，由市參會，市商會，社會局，市黨部，及總工會等五團體，各派代表，於施工期間輪流視察。</p>
<p>估計價值·當在卅億</p>
<p>據趙局長精密佔計，乙種房屋成本約爲七億元，甲種十億元。惟將來築成後，則估計其價値即可達三十億之數，因義貿房屋之一地皮，係由國家銀行無息墊款，建築材料則由冬令救濟會供給，而各承種造業亦以最低之工價承接。將來建築原料上漲，生活指數劇增後，房屋價格，必較成本增加數倍，故趙局長堅信，於三月初開獎之前，房屋義貿獎券必將爭售一空矣。</p>
<p>建築情形·招待參觀</p>
<p>〔又訊〕冬令救濟會房屋義貿部發行之房屋義賣券乙種券（即十萬元一張者），已確定於下星期一下午，假市體育館舉行開獎典禮。開獎辦法仍按照原有規定以三個球搖獎，絕對公開。至甲種券（即廿萬元一張者）因尙未全部售出，當於下月一日乙種券開獎時，再宣佈甲種券開獎之日期，但絕不延期過久。</p>
<p>又該會爲使各界明瞭義賣房屋建築之情形，特定明日上午十一時，招待各報社新聞記者，前往中正西路一五〇三號建築處參觀建築工程，吳市長屆時亦將同往，並有所報吿。</p>

<h3>漢奸房屋保管辦法　敵產處奉令施行</h3>
<p>關於漢奸房屋保管使用辦法，敵僞產業淸理處頃奉行政院制定着令變施如下：第一條，漢奸房屋經依法査封後，在標售前，公務機關得呈請行政院核准撥交保管使用。第二條，公務機關對於撥交保管使用之漢奸房屋，應與處理自己事務爲同一之注意，除自行負担修繕費外，應按月繳付使用費。第三條，公務機關對於撥交保管使用之漢奸房屋，不得變更其原狀，或增加建築物。第四條，公務機關對於撥交保管使用之漢奸房屋，非經行政院核准，不得爲移轉之行爲，其擅自移轉者，應即終止其保管使用，並由院將該房屋另行處理。第五條，漢奸房屋保管使用之點交及收費，由各地敵僞產業處理機關辦理之。第六條，漢奸房屋經判決沒收確定後，以標售爲原則，非經行政院核准，不得逕自由保管使用之機關承購。第七條，漢奸房屋經判決確定應予發還者，應即終止保管使用，發還產權所有人。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕甬籍靑年潘松林，現年廿六歲，賃居西藏南路文元坊十七號，性好漁色，時常在外狎妓，最近夜間常不歸家，其妻謝美月多方刺探，始悉潘邇與汕頭路六五弄三號妓院蔡四寳（係花界名妓有四小金剛之稱）熱戀，不常借旅店幽會，前晚獲悉潘又與蔡赴西藏路爵祿飯店，開闢四六七號房間，乃不動聲色，午夜密報老閘警局，會同幹警等馳往，即將一對野鴛鴦捕獲，一併押入警局，供認通姦不諱。據悉現已有親友出面調解，或不致對簿公庭。</p>
<h3>調整公用事業價公用局認為合理</h3>
<p>自公用事業自動調整公式實施後，本市各項公用事業，均按月調整售價，聞此次市參議會大會中將有若干參議員提議，請中央取消該項自動調整公式，記者以此詢問公用局長趙曾珏氏之意見，據稱：公用事業採取自動調整公式，係遵照中央命令辦理，務使各大公用事業公司，欲不致因虧損過鉅面停頓，現煤觔，汽油，上漲及外匯之掛高，實爲促使公用事業加價之主要因素，對生活指數之影響尙小，中央以前對公用事業係採取貼補政策，但目前中央亦無法負担此筆補貼金，故惟有應用該項自動調整方式較爲合理云。</p>

<h3>全國糧商代表聚首糧聯首屆大會揭幕　今日選舉理監事討論提案</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕中華民國糧食商業同業公會全國聯合會第　一屆會員代表大會，於昨日（廿二日）下午二時三十分，在民國路三七七號三樓正式揭幕。出席社會部長，糧食部長，及果市長代表葉實夫，中央農工部副部長陸京，士，經濟部代表陳權，市社會局代表吉明齋，全國商聯會理事長王曉籟，及各界來賓會員代表等共一百餘人，濟濟一堂。開幕式至四時完成，休息十分鐘，即舉行第一次大會，至六時許散會。</p>
<p>昨日參加會員，計達十八省，九個院轄市，佔全國地區約十分之七。其中全省聯合會四單位（浙皖川蘇），院轄市九個，計十三單位。省轄市十五個，計廿單位。縣級六十一個，計六十七單位。共計參加會員一百〇四單位，代表實到七十餘人，收到提案共約六十件。大會主席團推定萬墨林，黄桐生，張超，王竹浦，瞿振華，何錦文，韓德照，張景煒，陳育才，趙章吉，陳鑫智，蔡玉書，宗明倫，嚴濟寬，彭佐之等十五人擔任。</p>
<p>糧商政府六間橋樑</p>
<p>揭幕時首由該會籌備主任萬墨林宣讀開會詞，略謂：本會經五閱月之籌備，今始宣吿成立，承政府長官，各界來賓，及各省市糧商代表撥冗參加，實深慶幸。繼謂今日國內之食米間題，並非如相像中之惡化。環觀世界之糊荒問題，亦不如去年時之嚴重。且去年國內食米收成，約達七成之譜。祗須調劑得當，食米應無問題。茲者京滬等五大都市，已着手進行配給糧食。美國救濟物責中，糧食亦佔大部。政府正積極充實糧源，安定社會民生，同業亦應硏究如何使政府與人民合作，使每人均有飯吃，同時使侮人均有力量吃飯。</p>
<p>繼由主席團瞿振華致詞，略稱：本會之成立，實爲糧商與政府間之一座橋樑。今後亟望藉此而促進政府與糧商之合作云。瞿氏繼即分請政府長官，各界來賓，相繼致詞。</p>
<p>谷部長希望二點</p>
<p>谷部長致詞，略稱：全國糧商之有聯合組織，民元後尙屬首創。此舉在糧食本身，社會民生，及戡亂政策上，均含有重大之意義。按商業同業公會法第一及第七兩條中，對同業公會組織之宗旨及任務，均已明白規定。故貴會之成立，本人希望兩點：（一）力求健全貴會組織，依照一定宗旨，達成同業公會之任務。除維護同業之利益外，更應同時矯正同業之弊書。（二）要協助政府推行糧政，藉以安定社會民生經濟。民以食爲天，望糧商負起調劑之責任，而尤須注意應在維護國家社會利益之前提下，以維護同業之利益。</p>
<p>兪部長及吳市長代表葉實夫致詞，希望糧商協助政府，穩定糧價。站在吳市長之地位言，更切望上海市塲之糧價，能因此長期穩定。</p>
<p>經濟部代表陳權致詞，略稱：望貴會任務，不僅止於維謹同業利益，更應硏究如何發揮聯合會之貢獻。故深望貴會負起輔導糧商之責任。</p>
<p>糧食押匯應開放</p>
<p>來賓王曉籟致詞後，復由民食調配會任顯羣致詞。任氏提出三點：（一）目前糧價，與一般物價相較，未能稱昂。故個人主張，糧價與一般物價，應有合理之水準。四聯總處曾通過國家行局辦理民生日用必需品押匯辦法，月息僅取五分，可减輕採運之成本。故個人主張，糧食押匯首應開放。（二）戰後糧商採運能力，不如戰前甚遠。致若千消費地區，均感存糧不足。據統計本市存糧不過廿萬担，故糧價不易長期穩定。研究情勢，擬請糧部對若干都市，開放糧食押匯，並存儲若干糧食。（三）在上海與內地糧價倒掛之局面下，深感今日糧價之無法控制，故切望政府設法恢復上海爲糧食轉口之中心，俾能藉此穩定糧價。</p>
<h3>建立糧食保壘　消滅內亂禍根</h3>
<p>最後市社會局代表吉明齋致詞，建議各代表於大會閉幕後，返還各地時，應分別建立糧食堡壘，聯合消滅內亂禍根。</p>
<p>開幕式吿成後，四時十分起，即繼開第一次大會。主席團張超主席，除分發籌備經過報吿外，即討論通過會章，至六時許散會。大會籌備會即假廣東路招商局六樓，招待全體出席代表。</p>
<p>大會定今日上午召開各組審査會，下午二時舉行第二次大會，選舉理監事，及討論提案。如時間許可，當日下午五時，即行閉慕。當選第一屆理監事，定於廿四日下午二時，宣誓就職後，並舉行第一次理監事會議。</p>
<h3>改進重傷病營養　籌設軍友服務站</h3>
<p>聯合勤務總司令部，爲籌劃各軍醫院，改進重傷軍病官兵特別營養起見，特派該部新聞處朱處長靜濤蒞滬，昨在上海港口司令部邀集有關人員，舉行會議。朱氏即席說明來滬任務後，繼即商討澈底改善傷病官兵主副食，及辦理重傷重病官兵特別營養諸問題，決定由聯勤總部邀請軍之友社，於上開四傷兵醫院，先行籌設軍友傷兵服務站，專任改進軍傷患之特別營養，俟辦有成效時，再行普遍推行至全國其他各軍醫院。</p>

<h3>從皇室復辟問題看去</h3>
<p>— 第一信　本報特派員毛樹淸</p>
<p>〔本　布魯塞爾十四日航訊〕布魯塞爾，被稱爲『小巴黎』的西歐花都，經過這次戰爭的洗禮以後，比眞巴黎更壯大，更繁榮了</p>
<p>離開紐約半年多來，我旅行在歐洲大陸上，第一次，第一次在布魯塞爾看見那麽漂亮的百貨公司，那麼繁榮昌隆的市面。黄昏薄暮中，你如果站在布魯塞爾的北火車站，向南凝望那一條條平行的寬暢的馬路，那些和紐約『時報廣塲』可以媲美的霓虹燈，使一個外來的遊客，爲之頭昏目炫。在比利時，你可以買到最高貴的法國化裝品，最摩登的美國時裝，最名貴的英國香烟，比利時名義上也有『可邦』的配給制度，但任何一家商店，都歡迎你有「可邦」票的顧客。比利時的市塲是自由的，自由到眞正的美國貨，比在紐約買還要公道，一雙賣到一塊半錢的美國『耐隆』絲襪，在布魯塞爾祗要四十二個比國法郞，（約合九角七分）。駱駝脾，馬立斯，白吉士，大批的美國香烟，也許比上等的比國烟還要便宜些。布魯眾爾幾十家電影院，除了極少數幾家保持傳統精神以外，幾乎是淸一色的好萊塢新片，如果說：戰後美國的大量生產，須得在歐洲找尋『傾銷』的市塲的話，比利時無疑是他們心目中最好的一個。</p>
<p>今年的聯合國大會</p>
<p>要在歐洲舉行，聯合國的秘書長賴伊先生，前些日子，漫遊歐洲，要物色一個『適宜』的都市，賴伊在比利時受到狂熱的歡迎，布魯塞爾市政當局，在盡全力爭取這一個錦標。據比國朋友們估計，開一次聯合國大會，至少得四五千人，甚至六七千人，那些一大量的物資消耗，在歐洲恐怕很難找到一個能够無條件源源供應的都市，布魯塞爾就有那個資格。據他們說：唯一的缺點是布魯塞爾找不到一座大會場，鄕下有，但離市中心太遠。從前九國公約會議在布魯塞爾城內舉行過，但那祗是小規模的。聯合國大會的塲面，無疑要大得多。</p>
<p>繁榮決不是偶然的</p>
<p>第一，比利時的政治安定，比利時戰後雖然鬧了很大的『皇室糾紛』，但皇帝利吳波特第三，非常識相的一直居留在瑞士，最近而且優哉遊哉，坐船到新大陸漫遊去了。利奧波特三世的弟弟却爾親王，現在是比國的攝政，一位安靜自愛的典型皇族，很獲得比國人士的愛戴，因此大體上說，比國的政治是安定的。這次戰爭以後，比國也有了相當可觀的共產黨，去年選舉的結果，共產黨在上議院得了四席，在下議院得了二十三席，（下議院總數二百零二席），但是，比國的共產黨從來就很少有糾紛，他們在反對利奧波特三世復位一點上，跟社會黨取一致態度，非常堅持，除此以外，他們並沒有進一步的企圖。一九四五年，我到比利時的時候比國上下，都歡喜談『皇室問題』。事隔兩年多，問題依然沒有解決，但比國老百姓，却冷淡得多了。前任聯合國大會主席的斯巴克，去年榮任了比利時的首相以後，國會通過了一條決議案：授權斯巴克，與利奧波特皇帝詳細談判，復位與否？條件如何？斯巴克有初步全權決定之權，皇帝渡美之前，斯巴克帶了隨員去瑞士一次，據說和皇帝談了二個鐘點，皇室方面提供了很多利奧波特反對納粹法西斯的證據，證明他並沒有甘心向希特勒『稱臣納降』，其中最有力的一件證明是：皇帝曾經有一封秘密『血詔』，在納粹崩潰前一年，托人帶到倫敦的比國流亡政府，主張『抗戰到底，納粹必敗』。這件事在一家報紙上發表出來。但是，斯巴克的瑞士之行是不發表的，葫蘆裏什麼藥？局外人無從知道。我有一天在一家和皇室有親屬關係的貴族家裏吃飯，男爵夫人吿訴我：『全比利時，凡是虔誠的天主敎信徒，都歡迎皇帝歸來』。她並且斷定：斯巴克本人也是愛戴皇室的，『困爲他是一個有能力，有眼光的政治家』。後來我問比國外交部的一位先生，他搖搖頭說：『我們不談這間題罷，這問題現在是在冬眠狀態中』，但是，被我再三繞了圈子以後，他說：『現任首相斯巴克是社會黨，社會黨的決策，是反對皇帝復辟的！』他哈哈笑起來：『所以囉，問題就複雜起來，複雜的原因在這裏」！</p>
<p>反對皇室復辟的，還不　是社會黨，共產黨無疑地是『當然委負』，，此外，自由黨的一部份人士，也表示相同的意見，祗有天主敎黨是百分之百的純粹的『保皇　』</p>
<p>天主敎黨一直是比國最大的政黨，現在上議院四十四席之中，天主敎黨有二十一席。下議院二百零二席之中，天主敎黨佔九十二席。幾乎都是佔『壓倒傷勢』。斯巴克上台以前，比國是社會。自由，共產三黨『聯立內閣」，那時候，美蘇關係還沒有到萬分尖銳化，東歐西歐集團，還沒有劃分得太明顯。因之，三黨聯立，而天主敎黨被擯斥在野，成爲唯一的反對黨。斯巴克上臺，是東西歐集幽分野對峙以後，在另一方面，也反映西歐社會黨，所謂西歐『第二國際』的態度右轉。因此，他拉攏天主敎黨入閣，第一脚踢出共產黨，然後排斥力量比較微弱的『自由黨』。　憑西歐社會黨的彼此國際聲援，憑斯巴克的卓越才能，他是有方量使比國的政治局面安定下來的。再加上比國人勤懇的性格</p>
<p>所有的工業復員。都超過了戰前的原狀，我一九四五年，戰爭結束以後不久到布魯塞爾，已經覺得是刧後西歐的天堂。這回重遊，益覺得這樣物阜民康的小國家，令人可愛。有很多國際商人說：比利時是當今除了美國，全世界最富的國家。我曾經拿這句『過獎』的話，和外交部新聞處的瓦斯先生說起，他高興得大笑起來，他說：「我們不敢說富，但是我們敢誇耀比利時的復員建設迅速，凡是戰前比國所有的，比國今天都有，許多工業的復員程度，早超過了百分之一百，因此，我們纔有今天的表而的繁榮」！</p>

<h3>初春南國木棉紅</h3>
<p>〔本報廣州廿日航訊〕農曆新年過後，連日天期氣淸，風和日麗，不失爲春遊的好日子。穗市特產的紅棉樹，由於今年春天特別溫暖，那樹上鮮豔的花朶，也提前開放，紅遍了粤秀山頭，和各個公園裏，點綴着這南國的春光，顯得更加明媚。可是，在生活高壓下的今天，誰有這閒情逸緻去領略，春光雖好，亦祗有辜負它了。</p>
<p>一片漲風</p>
<p>「人日」過後，都市的一切便恢復了正常的活動，人們正在提起勁兒，等候新春帶給他們的佳訊。誰知隨着春風吹來的，却是一片可怕的漲風。首先是公共事業領頭：電燈費侮度由八千漲到一萬六千元，電話費基本數由二十萬漲到四十萬元，自來水費也增到每咪一萬九千元，平均普遍增加一倍。於是一般商民，有機可乘，也就將貨價一致呌高；，再加以近　天來，京滬金融物價波動影響所及，黄金外幣市價，隨着步步高升；而食米，油，鹽，糖，麵，雜糧，棉織品，柴薪等日用必需品，無不扶搖直上。道使一般民衆，回顧去年內物價指數的升漲，瞻望着今年以後的日子，眞是不寒而慄哩！</p>
<p>待遇調整</p>
<p>這個年頭，人民生活這樣困苦，而靠着人民來供養的政府，自然也就更窮；粤省政費不敷的數字，日形鉅大；已是無可諱言的事實。這次中央明令調整全國公務員待遇，廣州列爲第二區，照十一萬五千倍發給薪俸，這本來是公務負們的佳訊，但是粤省財政根本支絀，調整待遇後之政費增加數字，中央僅能補助七成，其餘三成須地方自籌。照目前粤省收入情形，雖然地方稅收近年來已有增進，惟相差數目仍遠，所以在開源節流原則之下，粤省財政當局，現在祗有一方面積極整理沙田，及準備開投屠宰稅，以增加收益。因爲沙田是粤省一個很大的財源，散佈在沿海濱江地區，照戰前統計，全省已有五百餘萬畝，而且沙田是冲積而成的，每年均有新生，故現在當不止此數字，祗惜十多年來，未予整理，現在賦稅的僅有九十萬畝，其餘四百多萬畝均未納稅，如果經過整理之後，確定其所有權，在政府賦稅方面的收入，自屬很可觀的。不過這都是將來的問題，整理沙田和開投屠宰稅都須經過一個時間，始能實施。而調整待遇，却是迫切需要解決的問題，在此情形之下，省府便祗有採取裁員一途；預定裁員的人數，是百分之十，全省雀級機構公務員七千多人，即是須裁七百多人。這項辦法據說已作決定，去留的標準是視乎工作成績優劣而定，被裁者發給遣散一個月至一月半，並分別介紹至各縣工作。那末，失業羣中，將又多七百多人了。</p>
<p>行政計劃</p>
<p>宋子文主席在廣東，到任後的幾個月來，從表面上委實看不出什麼顯著的成績；但他是個實事求是的人，從不肯預發「空頭支票」，寗願有了事實然後公布。其實在這幾個月來，他已深深體察到地方的實際情形，萸集了不少寳貴的資料，而有了一個關於粤省以及華南整個政治經濟建設的週詳計劃；這計劃從他和資委會委員長翁文灝先生共同發表的宣言，便可略見端倪。宋主席委實有超人遠大的眼光，他的一切設施，一不但安定目前，而且還高瞻遠矚，爲將來打算；如修築圍堤防患水災便是一例。去年粤省水災慘重，是全國皆知的；宋主席在下車伊始，便首先注意這個問題，不久便發動各界組織成立堤工委員會負責辦理各江堤圍的搶修工程，並於去年十二月開工，每日動用民工十九萬名工作，預定在本年四月以前，全部完成，則今年春潦湧漲，可不至泛濫成災了。</p>
<p>經濟建設</p>
<p>糧食方面，當局亦曾早作未雨綢繆；除在治本方面，由政府貸放大量優良稻種與農民，並指導其改進培植方法，使增加生產外；同時加强管制糧食，嚴厲査緝私運糧食出口；並爲應付靑黄不接之需，前後向湘桂等鄰省購糧，已達六萬担，尙有萬餘担在購運途中。最近更請中央與暹羅政府洽商，設法以暹米濟粤；所以今年的春夏間，相信不至有糧荒的現象了。此外？還有各種經濟建設的計劃，如：滃江水電廠，河南紡織廠，瓊崖鋼鐵廠，順德糖廠，以及開發乳源八字嶺的煤礦等，都在積極的進行，連日海外回國的僑胞，和若干外商，與宋主席接觸頻繁，完全是洽商這些問題，所以我們憧憬華南經濟建設的遠景，是無限光榮燦爛的；目前阻撓着這一切的發展，就是各地的奸匪騷擾，這是一件最可痛惜的事情。（本報特派員梁風）</p>

<h3>西子湖畔　周象賢市長一席談</h3>
<p>— 本報特派員　儲裕生</p>
<p>〔本報杭州廿六日訊〕春天巳經來了，這馳譽中外的花園都市—杭州，已漸漸地披上嬌嫩顏色的衣衫，引動一般人對她的傾倒。今年西子湖上的春汛，要比往年熱鬧，這是已經過許多人預料的，即是三任杭州的老市長周企虞氏，也有如此的看法，他欣慰地吿訴我：「往年春節，只有外國人到杭州來玩，今年上海很多人都到杭州來度春節，相信今年的春季香汎一定遠勝於去年。」他又說：「在年關的時候起一直到今天止，杭州沒有發生過一件盜案，春節時，黄包車伕，船伕，苦力等收入都特別好，這樣可以穩定社會的底下層，如果今年香汛再來一個旺年，則杭州的一切情形都很穩定了。」</p>
<p>杭州這個都市，眞是「三冬靠一春」，去年商業的情形，各地以及上海，南京都相當的好，所以一定有很多人趁這大地春回之時，到杭州來化一些錢，飽賞湖山景色，並不在乎什麼。在杭州酒肆飯店之中，仍舊可以吃原桌菜，要豐盛一點，也可以呌得出來，比起上海來，自然自由得多了，其間因爲吃食店內的筵席捐，佔着市府收入的一大部份。周市長對這，也有一番理論，即是杭州是風景區，到風景區來的人當然遊覽的人較多，遊覽的人若受飲食上的限制，無異對遊覽者掃興，而且杭州的吃食店，完全靠着外來的遊客，如果太嚴格了，吃食店也不能維持了。周市長吿訴我，節約是好的，但節約還在於良心，如果飲食方面吃人一隻菜，把盆子拿走，再搬上一隻菜來，像這樣的節約，也只落得徒勞而無功。杭州西子湖四週的名勝古蹟有一個太平洋旅行社已與市府洽妥願意担任修葺，不過要做　一些各大廠商的廣吿，周市長吿訴我，帮助市政府建設名勝，自然是歡迎的。看今年到底有沒有成效，否則，也就取消這個原議了。至於雷峰塔的興建，一時談何容易。據他表示比雷峰塔急要的事情還多着，所以重建雷降塔只好緩緩再談了。」</p>
<p>杭州市的物價，據周市長的看法，還算是平穩的，比起上海來要便宜多了，有幾個上海來的人，在樓外樓吃一次飯，大喊便宜，有幾個住了一夜上等旅館，也覺得很便宜。所以杭州人在香汛時節雖然「刨黄瓜」，但還要比上海平時便宜。不過香汛將到杭州市政府急着要整理各條馬路與名勝區，據周市長說：各條柏油馬路都要整理一下，依據去年的經驗，需柏油五百四十桶，現在柏油價五百萬元一桶，五百桶柏油就要二十五億元。再加上油漆更新湖濱公園的欄杆，中山公園前的粉飾，三潭印月的修葺，各名勝區的略加佈置，總要五十億。市政府雖然沒有錢，但這是必需要做的。所以先弄了十億把柏油定了下來。市府的財政情形當然是很困難，一二月份，所屬同人的薪津想要求補足新標準，周氏意如補足新標準，事實上必須拖欠三月份的新標準，則反而使同人感到困苦，所以不如自三月份起照新標準發薪，而不致拖欠來得好些。現在杭州市政府，除事業機關外，職工一共三百二十人，據說照中央　制，應有五百二十人，所以這次浙江省的裁員，市政府可免彼及。</p>
<p>我和周市長暢談時曾問他是否可在吒盛的香汛過後，杭州受惠的商家可以在名勝區稍加貢獻。周氏笑着搖搖頭說：「現在幣制貶値，一切都不好辦，戰前市府每年經費三百萬元，每月經常費十五萬元，用來應付裕如，現在數字龐火，反有顧此失彼之惑，眞是困難，我想等幣値穩定了，市政就可有大復興的工作做出來，在現在這樣的情形下，也只有如此了。」他對今天杭州　社會活動不够熟烈，深深地感到苦悶。爲了春季的香汛，爲了今年的香汛要較往年熱鬧，爲了防免來遊春燒香的人太擁擠，以致像去年樣在街上步行了一晚，在船上宿了一晚，在三輪軍上躭了一晚起見，周市長已經命令各家旅館，準備大批帆布床，以迎待旅客，免得來杭州的人弄得有錢無住處。</p>
<h3>蘇省保安司令部機構決擴大改組</h3>

<h3>魯政近貌</h3>
<p>〔本報濟南十九日航訊〕半年來的軍事演變，使得山東戰塲，幾乎從國人的記憶中逐漸消逝了去。由於國軍收復沂蒙山區，底定膠東，光復烟台，劉伯承陳毅匪部主力的相繼南竄豫鄂皖，於是，正不知有多少人已在喊出：「山東戰事已成尾聲的尾聲」，「山東也儼然成爲後方的後方了！」</p>
<p>基於上而這一種看法，自然亦有其部份的事實根據，尤其是津浦路徐濟段兩月餘來的暢通無阻，使原來生活在戰火裏的齊魯兒女獲一暫時喘息的機會，而仍在戰火燎原中的東北及冀晋熱，與本來最安定今天亦已在接近戰爭邊緣的江南過日子的人，自然都將異口同聲地說：「山東業已進入較為安定的小康局面了！」</p>
<p>事實上，陳毅劉伯承的主力雖有一部在山東被擊潰，但因其殘餘改採空心戰術，迅速南竄，又由於東北戰緊，國軍爲求控制北寗路，致原來佔有三分之一以上政府在魯各路大軍，尙未及將魯共土八路澈底殲滅前，就紛紛南調或北上，這在客觀上遂予魯共以可乘之隙，「野火燒不盡，春風吹又生」，眼看着擁有九十六個團佔有絕對傷勢　魯共士八路及正規軍第二，七，九，十三等縱隊，又「你來我去，你去我來」了。</p>
<p>截至去年十月，山東戰事發展至最高潮時全省一〇七縣三普通市就城市言，國軍佔領了六十七縣三普通市，但國軍因大兵團源源外調，兵力不敷分配，非戰略要點不得不復行放棄，於是截至目前，保存在國軍手中的已只剩四十一個縣市，而這其中眞正全部在政府控制之下的僅是十四個縣市，其餘尙是半控制區和據點控制區。</p>
<p>魯兼主席王耀武面對着這千瘡百孔的局面，嘗手訂五項重點工作作為本年度施政的準繩，那就是：培養幹部，組調民衆，整建地方武力，消剩散匪，加增生產。其中對過去地方部隊　缺點，王氏謂爲主要的乃在：「幹部缺乏訓練」，「訓練不得方法」；「征補制度不合理」；「編判複雜不統一」，以致運用難期靈活，力量無從發揮，因此王氏提出今年的整訓方法是以「統一編制」，「統一待遇」；「統一敎育」，「統一指揮」爲四大目標，並厲行「一人一槍」之精神主張，不採形式的擴充方式，必須採過去在觀念與意識上，精神與實質上，可以澈底改造，方能恢宏保衛家鄉，綏靖地方的自衛力量。</p>
<p>尾聲的尾聲與　山東戰事能否眞正成為尾聲的尾聲與山東能否成爲「後方的後方」，主要的就看王兼主席所標　的五大重點工作所收的成效如何以爲斷”而這五大重點工作中尤其整建地方武力更爲「重點的重點」，原因是一切以安定爲第一，沒有健全的强有力的地方武力，就無法達到安定地方的的目的。（特派員麗天）</p>

<h3>中日生絲輸出比較</h3>
<p>（上接第七版）</p>
<p>據美國復興財政公司統計，三十六年三月份，美國商業公司在美發售之日本生絲，計一五二五包，價値爲九四八八九三美元。自三十五年七月，美國商業公司開始經售日本生絲起，迄三十六年三月底，共經售日本生絲二八二四八包，計値美金二七，六六九，一七三萬元。又截至三月底止，該公司之日本生絲存貨，共計五六二一六包。二月底日本國內生絲存貨可資輸出者，共計六一四〇七包。如將此數字，與上述我國去年最初十一個月之生絲輸美數字（約一萬一千包）相比較，可知日本生絲在美國市塲中，仍佔壓倒之優勢。</p>
<p>日本今後五年內，計劃每年產絲三十萬包，以供輸出，其最大顧客自屬美國無疑。按美國今後生絲市塲，據美國絲業專家估計，每年常可吸收六十萬包。如果我國能於五年內，每年產絲三十萬包，以資出口，尙可爭取美國生絲市塲之一半。惟我國經此次抗戰結果，絲業之損失至鉅，恢復匪易。　據中蠶公司估計，我國戰時蠶絲損失如下：甲，絲產損失：（一）家蠶絲產損失一，六〇三，〇〇〇公担，（二）柞蠶絲損失四〇〇，〇〇〇公担，合計二，〇〇三，〇〇〇公担。乙，器材損失：（一）養蠶業受損蠶戶二，六〇〇，〇〇〇戶，損失總値二三六〇，〇〇〇，〇〇〇包。（二）製種業减少製種量四，六〇〇，〇〇〇張，損失總値一〇，九〇〇，〇〇〇元。（三）製絲業損失絲車四五，〇〇〇台，損失總値二八，一〇〇，〇〇〇元。（四）其他損失總値二，五〇〇，〇〇〇元。器材損失合計，三〇〇，〇〇〇，〇〇〇元，（戰前法幣値）。丙，桑園荒廢損失：（一）被廢棄之桑園二，一八〇，〇〇〇畝，損失桑樹一，一三二，〇〇〇，〇〇〇株。（二）受損失之桑園五，三六〇，〇〇〇畝，應補更新桑樹八六八，〇〇〇，〇〇〇株。桑樹損失總數二，〇〇〇，〇〇〇，〇〇〇株，似此損失之鉅，欲謀恢復戰前產量，並謀其增加，均成當前重大問題。　據估計三十七年生絲產量，蘇浙皖區廠絲·絹絲·土絲·可達四四〇〇〇關擔。川滇區廠絲·小廠絲·土絲·一五〇〇〇關擔。廣東區廠絲·土絲·一二〇〇〇關擔。柞蠶絲一〇〇〇〇官擔。其他各省蠶絲一四〇〇關擔。合計約八二四〇〇關擔。除內銷外，可能外銷者，當在五五〇〇〇關擔，爲量亦極有限。　今後對於我國蠶絲事業，如何予以技術之改進，業務之輔導，金融之扶植，輸出之推廣等，均有待於各方之一致努力，以期增加生產，拓展銷路。否則後此與日本競爭生絲市塲，將難得手矣。（三十七年一月於上海工商輔導處）</p>
<h3>具有國防價值的績溪石綿礦</h3>
<p>〔本報徽州十八日訊〕績溪地處皖南徽寗心臟，爲黄山縱脈所經，頗饒礦產。其地蘊藏金鎢銀礦之外，更有舉世珍視的石綿。該礦在民初已發現，民二十五年，皖建廳曾派礦業專家沈國楨和武漢大學理學院長麥健之到績視察，査勘結果，認爲礦質豐優。</p>
<p>專家重視該礦發現經過，是在民廿一年，礦區附近鄉民，見山間壘壘石塊，色白堅硬異常，認爲可製石灰。取燒結果，仍堅靱如故，不易熔化成灰；於是利用那山澗的水力，把石塊放在水碓內春成細粉，摻入熟石灰裏，用以糊刷牆壁，不特堅固潔白，而且異常美觀。後來被人發覺它有防火的功用。識者亦斷定這種石塊是石綿礦無疑了。</p>
<p>民廿三年，本省舉行蕪屯公路沿綫物產展覽會，礦區鄕人，亦將此石送會展覽，經專家考察硏究，亦認這種石綿，原質極佳，一時曾引起本省當局　各地　　　家的重視，</p>
<p>面積豐厚</p>
<p>鑛區地點，在績溪縣東北鄉西坑頭，水石社廟的成功山及黄連嶺一帶，鑛區盡是石山，石塊多屬灰色，在灰石的中間，夾着一條條很有紋理的白色石頭，這白石就是石綿。鑛區的大石脈面，有接通不斷的飯碗口大的鱗形石片，如同龍鱗一般。鑛區面積，約四十二公畝餘，有八寸左右寬厚。</p>
<p>具耐燃性</p>
<p>石綿的功用極大，最富耐燃性，任在極高度的火力中，都不能燬損其絲奄。它的唯一特殊功效，是能避免火災，可做消防用的一切工具，在科學上爲最有價値的鑛物。國內殊不多覯，即世界各國對於具有國防性的石綿，也是非常重視，而且是極端需要的。</p>
<p>開採價值</p>
<p>在民二十五年，武漢大學麥院長親到鑛區視察後，曾具呈向建廳登記，領有開採該鑛的執照權。接着又有上海鑛商洪玉麟，續向建廳呈請開採該鑛，計屬石綿鑛區面積，共有四十二公畝二十五公厘，旋因抗戰發生中止開採。</p>
<p>最近該縣商民胡某，爲謀開發家鄕寳貴富源，擬即聯合鑛區農民，集合自有資力，用土法試行開採，聞已與京滬鑛物學專家一度商洽，此項計劃，決定在年內進行。（本報特約記者兪寗頗）</p>

<h3>民生敎育　把握歷史重心　解決民生問題</h3>
<p>— 王裕凱</p>
<p>民生，是歷史的重心。古令中外歷史上所記載的盛衰治亂，都是民生問題的反映。一個國家或朝代，其盛治之時，就是他的民生問題，得到了圓滿的解決。反之其衰亂之時，就是他的民生問題，發生嚴重的恐慌，而明　社會的騷動。成功的英雄衆傑，與賢明的政治家，無不道守此一歷史的鐵則。</p>
<p>如何　定　歷史的重心，使國家和社會不再走以前的　壞道路呢？就有賴於敎　了。馬上　天下，不能以馬上治天下。則治天下者就要文治，即是敎育。所以我　出民生敎育來，以供獻於治國平天下者。作把握歷史重心之一助。</p>
<p>民生敎育，　杜　所提倡的「生活即敎育」，大致相同。敎育不能脫離人民的實　生活，換言之，即敎育要助人民謀生活的解決。三民主義的民生主義，以民生是歷史的重心作根據，而定出解決民生問題的方案來，全靠敎育實現之。民生敎育的任務在此。衣，食，住，行，是民生問題的基本要素。敎育對此四者，應傳授人民以相當的知識技能，使人人皆沾其便利。就衣來就，由冬裘夏葛，以至冬呢夏絲，這些原料的來源與供給，即發生了生產與運輸兩個問題。就食來說，中國以農立國，但糧食反感不足。自古皆知道民以食為天，但民食堪虞，其中需要解決的問題更多了。就住來說，由造林以至建築，都是專門學問，而且中國的住宅，都不注意球境設計。復員以來，都市人口的增加，住的問題，已形嚴重，我們將怎樣解決呢？就行來說，如果以路之畏短，衝量國家文明之高低。則中國的行，需要吾人加倍努力的修築道路。而修築問題，民生主義　有方案　指示，需要民生敎育來實　他。</p>
<p>我們應當　　的承認。以前乃至現在我們的敎育，都還不能負起民生敎育的使命。雖然敎育的宗旨，包括了謀民生發展這一項。而十幾年來，敎育與生活，仍不能配合起來，更談不上敎育即生活。有人說：中美敎育不同之點，即中國的敎育，是敎人民非完全需要的，美國的敎育，則是敎人民完全需要的。時至今日我們應該改正過來了。敎育是現代國家生命力之一，不容再誤，更不容與民生主義脫節。中山先生對民生二字的定義，是：「人民的生活，社會的生存，國家的生計，羣衆的生命」。但以人民的生活（衣食住行）為主要，所以生計，生存，生命，只是生活的充實和擴張而已。因此，民生敎育，也注重謀人民生活的解決。對社會的生存，國家的生計，羣衆的生命三人，認為是人民生活之充實與　張。解決了人民生活問題，自然會解決生存生計生命三個問題。</p>
<p>民生敎，是手腦並用的敎育。一方面用腦，一方面用手，無勞心者與勞力者之分，亦無君子與野人之別、這樣才做到敎育的平等，而使歷史的重心穩定，無盛衰治亂之循環。人民的生活，向上發展，充實，美滿，幸福　民生敎育又是活敎育，一方面作，一方面學，而所作所學，就是生活所需要的。我們學農，　　就是實驗場。學工，工廠就是研究所。活敎育，也就是社會即學校。</p>
<p>今日敎育上的問題太多，就是民生問題沒有適當的解決。於是見　見智，各　主張。以職業為出發點者，　　　敎育。以生產為出發點者，日生產敎育。這些都可以包括於民主敎育之內，凡承認民生是歷史的重心，把握此重心而謀國，必實行民生敎育。</p>
<h3>對世運足球選拔　港方五項建議　容啟兆將轉體協會答覆</h3>

<p>港方五點意見</p>
<p>首由陳榮柏致辭：他表示港僑胞體育遜勃發展，尤其是足球，實不應處處受外人挨制，為了一致團結對外，體協會應加緊全作。繼討論選拔球員參與世運如何進行事。這一點香港華人足球聯會曾提有五點意見交協會參考，由總幹事鐘志強當衆宣讀五點意見。關於詢問者：（一）球員　　旅費之保證。（二）足球領隊人選請即公佈。（三）球員出發期間之家庭生活費應如何辦理。關於建議者兩項：（四）預選採分區比賽制，冠軍隊選拔球員不得少過六人，不得多過十二人，亞軍隊則由四人至九人，季軍隊由二人至六人，不足之數，則在其他參加預選隊伍中選拔。（五）選拔委員除原定五人外，香港體協分會得增派二人，海外聯增派二人。</p>
<p>容啟兆之答覆</p>
<p>宣讀後，容啟兆分別作答：（一）關於足球隊回程旅費，政府對世運代表團已撥出十五萬美元為經費，回程旅費，不用擔心。（二）足球領隊，則由本人負責，但如有高賢者。當表歡迎。（三）對於球員生活問題，（指對出發期內家庭生活費）容啟兆謂應根據全國體協會業餘規則辦理，在此規則未更改前，本人不敢提出別項辦法。至於第四，五，兩項，因與全國體育協進會原定者有衝突處，須去函請示，然後能答覆。</p>
<p>會議至此，香港體協分會，即先討論如何進行工作，議決：（一）關於華人足球聯會之五項建議，全部接納。（二）將建議轉容博士，轉呈協會。（三）關於預備辦理遴選工作，由南華，星島，東方，中華，光華，傑志，巴士各派代表一人，商討進行。</p>

<h3>今年的奧林匹克大會　英國正積極進行着籌備　十七項競技五十國參加</h3>
<p>本文係英國奧林匹克世運大會籌備委員會主席勃格萊爵士所著，刋載倫敦星期泰晤士報，對奧林匹克世界運動會眞義，多所發揮，並對本屆籌備經過，亦有所報告，本報特　譯於次。</p>
<p>今年七月二十九日下午四時，第十四屆奧林匹克運動大會將由英皇宣布揭幕。因體育競技而產生的國際友誼，其意義是如何的深長與重大、這一支業餘運動的火炬，戰前曾經輝煌萬邦，本年的「奧林匹克火炬」也將和古時代一校，使用希臘北部奧林匹克峯上的一面巨大的放大鏡，集中陽光燃着這一支火炬，鐵後由各國運動家，接力賽跑交替傳遞，不問風雨晝夜，在這歷史性的開幕日的下午，抵達倫倫敦溫姆勃萊體育場，用火炬引着場上的聖燄—它在比賽舉行期內，將日夜燎燒不息。無數的信鴿將升起空中—古奧林匹克時代，是呌他們把開幕的消息，傳知各地，在打仗的也要停下來。吉柏齡所著的「奧林匹克讚美詩」，由麥爾康薩琴德爵士指揮的　　　隊演奏，各大歌詩班合唱。各國的　　以及其他隊伍，排成具有歷史意義的行列，時代最偉大的體育節日，便宜告揭幕。</p>
<p>在這裏面，可以發見眞實的希望與證據，令人相信世辦　不着悲觀；在這個人類　接來往互相努力的場合，無論如何，有一個全世界人民相互了解眞正基礎存在。</p>
<p>本全的各項籌備專宜，進行順利。不但政府給予助力，大多數愛好運動的英國人民，也一致盡力支援。我們遍邀六十個國家參加，已經有五十國接受邀請。預計出席本屆大會的各國運動選手，總數將達六千名，他們將在十七類項運動競賽中爭取至高的榮譽。</p>
<p>十七項競技</p>
<p>田徑運動，以及曲棍球，足球的半決賽和決賽，將在溫姆勃萊體育場舉行，障　賽馬將於派律士特士舉行，在那兒將可以看到全球優的馬跳浜。游泳將在帝國游泳池舉行，拳擊，劍術和體操表演的地點，就在該池附近。哈爾格健身房將成為角力，舉重，與籃球比賽的所在；脚踏車比賽在赫納山舉行；划船在海萊河上競賽，亞爾達索廣場將為射擊，騎術以及五項運動舉行地點。托爾奎將是快艇逐鹿場所。藝術比賽則準備在維多利亞與阿爾勃博手館分別陳列。</p>
<p>籌備委員會開始經常辦公已歷多月，計劃如何利用因勞力以及建築材料不敷應用，而造成的少數場，所舉行所有的競賽。幸賴空運部，國防部和勞工部給予傳利，中以容納各國選手居住的房舍，現已建築完成，而選手們往返的交通，亦已計劃妥當。隨着運動員而來的，勢大批觀衆，來參觀，和觀光的英國。替他烏準備適當的寓所，這一件工作，已由貿易部的遊歷處逕和旅館業同業公會洽辦。</p>
<p>我曾在報章上讀到一兩位人士的見解，他們以為在物力如此欠缺的條件之下，不能像戰前的招待我烏的賓客，還是放棄世運的舉辦為宜。據我外人的觀感，這兩位先生對於奧林匹克大會觀衆的心意，可謂缺管了解。觀衆當然明瞭我等推行工作時所經種處困難，但他烏更知道我烏必盡最大努力去表現傳統的好客的精神。根據各國代表的報吿書，他們對我們的招待計劃，頗表滿意；而我國在國家如此艱困中，卒能完成此艱巨的工作，尤使他們感動。</p>
<p>四海成一家</p>
<p>觀衆們遠道來此，並不是來找批評的目標，他們被四海一家　運動精神所感召，而來欣賞各國的少年菁英在此競奪世界冠軍的榮譽。我相信觀衆在回抵家鄕之後，必以曾作此空前體育盛會的座上客，而引以為勞。國際的業餘體育運動，無疑地將成為溝通世界民族間的橋樑，他有一重要的任務，是來重建今日世界正缺欠的相互間的信任　了解。</p>
<p>這世界運動大會不僅是幾幕重要的世界錦標決戰。眞正的奧林匹克的國際友愛精神，可以引用考勃廷男爵的一句名言來概括：「重要的不是戰勝人家，而是打得好，主要的不是勝利，而是參加。」</p>
<p>本屆世界運動大會就是在這種精神下舉行，在此世界歷史嚴重的時刻，這業餘體育的搖籃—英國，被選為大會的主人，我們該是如何的榮幸。</p>

<h3>花紗布管委會設穗辦事處</h3>
<p>〔本報廣州二十二日電〕經濟部以粤穗需要紗布甚鉅，因限制南運後，華南織造商大受影響，爲謀發展華南紡織染業，將限運辦法取銷，並在穗另設花紗布管委會穗辦事處，以呂穀儿爲處長，管理花紗管運事宜。</p>
<h3>刧後紗布應予歸還商民</h3>
<p>瀋士浩痛切陳述理由</p>
<p>淪陷期間，僞商統會曾强迫收購商民存貯紗布，其中染織工業，棉布商業，棉紗商業三公會會員，計被迫收購紗布數在廿萬件以上。雖偽商統會規定收購紗布，分付黄金現款，但收購價格與市價相較，懇殊甚鉅。商民已蒙害非淺，况僞商統會，於付予部份黄金後，未及支給現款，以日寇投降，即吿崩潰。</p>
<p>頃據染織同業公會理事長潘士浩謂，本人對發還刧後紗布一事，於勝利後，即以全力推進，曾草「刧後紗布應否歸還」一文，以期喚起政府及社會人士之重視，然政府始終未作任何積極處置，實屬遺憾。」即按法理言，凡「條約書契，於暴力壓迫下簽訂者，均歸無效，僞商統會美其名爲收買，實際上却以高壓方式，實行掠奪，盡人皆知。至勝利後，政府接收僞商統會遺存物資，其主權誰屬，事甚明顯。刧餘紗布，應發還受害商民，無待贅言」云云。聞刧後紗布，有棉紗萬餘件，棉布四萬餘件，即一百六十餘萬疋。</p>
<h3>婆羅州木材運滬</h3>

<h3>中央信託局發表桐油豬鬃市況</h3>
<p>中央信託局昨報導本週內國外桐油猪鬃市况如下：</p>
<p>國外桐油市價，因美國政府調査中國桐油銷美情形，尙未將結果宣佈，進口商及廠家均怯於進貨，市况沉寂。且有進口商企圖趁機抑低價格，從中漁利，我出口商洞燭其奸，已一致暫不競售，以免影響售價。政府方面聞於最近期內，對穩定桐油國外市價，亦將有所措施，故桐油市價雖一度險象環生，現已稍有轉機。紐約現貨仍售每磅美金二角四分五，香港方面C＆F紐約每磅美金二角三分五，倫敦桶裝油每長噸CIF英磅一七六磅。</p>
<p>國內油價上海每市担四百萬元，重慶二百三十六萬元，漢口三百四十二萬元，梧州三百三十五萬元，廣州三百五十萬八千元。</p>
<p>國外猪鬃價格平穩，僅上海鬃微軟，計重慶二七號黑配CF＆紐約每磅美金二元二角，漢口一七號黑配鬃三元〇五分，上海一七號黑配鬃二元一角，天津小五五黑配鬃四元八角，均略有成交。</p>
<p>國內價格上海鬃每關担四百萬元，已有做開，較農曆年關前略低，惟美匯廿日已掛高一成，價格勢將略漲。重慶漢口天津等地，因農曆年節方過，市塲尙未完全恢復活動。</p>
<h3>中日生絲輸出比較</h3>
<p>— 陳權</p>
<p>我國生絲爲出口商品之大宗，在一九〇八年以前，實佔國際生絲市塲之首要地位。彼時日本蠶絲業尙未十分發達，日本生絲於一八八〇年始向外推銷，是年輸出數量，僅八八四〇公担；而中國之輸出數量，則爲四九三二一公祖。但日本蠶絲業之發展，逐漸成爲中國生絲外銷之勁敵。自一九〇九年以後，日本生絲轍出數量，逐年增加，超出我國遠甚；其在國際市塲之地位，亦日臻重要，而中國反瞠乎後矣。一八八〇年至一九四六年間，中國輸出生絲之最低數額爲四九三二一公担，最高數額爲一一四八九四公担；而日本則自八八四〇公担，增至三五一三五二公担，其進展之速，使人有相形見細之感。據申報年鑑載，民國十五六年間，我國全國生絲產量，估計約爲二十五萬二千關担；而出口數字，民國十四年至十八年間，均在二十萬公祖左右，（連同廢絲在內）。內銷方面，估計應有六萬公担。是以全國產量，連同廢絲，當在二十五萬公祖以上。上項估計二十五萬二千關担，當係除去廢絲計算。至二十一年，遭受絲業恐慌影響，產量銳减。自此以後，輸出數字僅約十七八年間百分之四十左右；而日本在此期間內，生絲輸出，正是突飛猛進之時。</p>
<p>我國生絲輸出，戰前十年平均數量爲七萬餘公担。十年中，最高輸出數量爲十一萬四千餘公担；其價格由十六七年之每担二千餘元，降至二十三年之七百餘元。至抗戰前夕，始漲爲一千一百餘元。十年平均，則爲一千六百三十八元。廢絲輸出數量，十年平均爲六萬　一千餘公担。十年中最高輸出數量爲九萬六千餘公担。比較生絲，所差不過一成有餘。其價格由十八年之每担二百一十餘元，一度降至七十元，十年平均爲一百四十九元。戰後我國生絲輸出，以國內成本增高，國外市價時有降落，以致陷於呆滯狀態。三十五年我國各種生絲出口，共約八千五百公担；其平均價格，每担約三百五十萬元。此外廢絲輸出約七千五百公担。平均價格約二十七萬五千元。如與戰前輸出數量，與戰前幣値比較，則其衰落情形，可以槪見。</p>
<p>至於輸出國別，以美國居首位。着美國生絲消費量，較其他國家爲大。故如能把握美國市塲，則對生絲輸出貿易可操勝算。惟若與“本過去生絲輸美情形，加以比較，實足憂慮。美國在一九二六年至一九三五年中之生絲消費量，佔全世界生絲消費量百分之十五，每年約七十萬担。其中大部份爲日本絲，我國生絲僅佔極小部份。戰後情形亦未許樂歡，茲略加分析如左：</p>
<p>在一八九一年至一九四一年期中，日本輸美之生縣，在美國進口生絲總數量中、所佔之比例，逐漸增加。由百分之五十左右，增至百分之九十左右，最高額曾達百分之九十七，（如一九三四年）。在一九二一年後，日本生縣在美銷路，除一九二一年至一九二三年時期外，均佔美國進口生絲總數量百分之八十以上，實居於極優越之地位。</p>
<p>我國生絲在此時期中，所佔比例，均居劣勢。雖一八九五年至一八九七年，曾達百分之二五，惟迨後即逐漸减少。自一九三一年以後，除一九四〇年，至一九四一年中，超過百分之十外，其餘年度，均在百分之十以下。一九三四及一九三八兩年，且减至百分之二。茲將一九二一至一九四一年中日生絲輸美之統計，列表如左　以上所述，爲戰前及抗戰初期之一般情形。至於戰後情形，亦有諸多可慮者。我國生絲轍出，前此以受日本蠶絲業發展之壓迫，無法打開出路。國內人士皆以為戰後日本，蒙受戰爭損失，一時不易復興，其絲業亦難例外。我國正可趁此時搬，把握美國市塲，取日本生絲池位而代之。惟實際狀况，則適相反。依據美商部統計，在一九四六年最初十一個月，我國輸往美國生絲爲一萬一千五百包，約及一九三九年同期，我國輸美生絲數量七分之一。反觀日本生絲事業，其情形則遠勝於我國。</p>
<p>日本戰後，因喪失其原有殖民地，以致國內所需糧食，須靠國外輸入，且爲量甚鉅。如糧食問題不能解決，則日本內部之安定與安全，均難確保。美國駐日領軍當局，爲謀解決此項嚴重問題計，遂代爲籌劃輸入食糧等爲需品。因此進而代爲籌措外匯，以支付食糧之輸入。結果遂採取扶植日本生絲輸出之方策：而日本生絲事業，在佔領軍當局維護之下，又已欣欣向榮，且以輸美爲主要市塲。至其經營輸出方式，則由日本政府設立之貿易局主持，以日幣向民間收購生絲，轉交美國佔領軍當局。然後由美國復興財政公司附設之美國商業公司，根據市塲情形，酌定價格出售。職是之故，日本生絲在美國市塲之售價，與其生產成本，不發生關係。其國內生產成本，縱有增加，但對生絲出口，不發生影響。</p>

<h3>鈾的鬭爭</h3>
<p>— 強華</p>
<p>大家知道，鈾（Uranium）是製造原子能的必需原料。而且，在原子炸彈還沒有受到國際管制的今日，大家都認爲誰得到了更多的鈾，誰就得到了國家安全的保障。尤其是安全感最敏銳的美國和蘇聯，正在從事鈾的鬥爭。</p>
<p>現在的情形究竟怎樣呢？兩方面已進展到若何程度呢？要答覆這些問題，讓我們列舉世界上產鈾的重要地帶，並指出各個油礦供應的態勢。</p>
<p>美國方面能够購到鈿鑛的地方有下述各處：</p>
<p>比屬剛果（Belgian　Congo）產鈾最多，據合衆社訊，地質學家估計這區域存有世界已知產鈾量的百分之七十。全部產量供給美國的事實，已成了比國國會的一樁激烈的政治爭辯。比國政府不願公佈全部產量的數字，最近紐約先鋒論壇報載稱，由可靠方面的資料中研究得在一九四六年出了二千噸礦沙，一九四七年的前三個月出了一千六百噸。</p>
<p>比國國會裏的共產黨員和左翼份子宣稱，美國所付的代價，是少得「可笑」，而那些美國鈾鑛專家簡直把比利時當成了「殖民地」　國務總理史巴克氏（Paul　Henrg　Spaaks）答稱：與美國所訂的戰時協定仍在施行，這情形須繼續維持至聯合國決定廢止爲止。</p>
<p>加拿大西北區域的邊地大熊湖（The　Great　Bear　Lake）一帶，產鈾之富，位居第二。實際上也是將全部出產供給美國的。不過噸位的數字無從知曉。加拿大尙保留一小部份已採的礦沙於白堊河（Chalk　River）附近，作爲它自己製造原子能之用。</p>
<p>美國本部的科勒拉多（Colorado）新近步入產鈾的顯著地位，據報該地鈾的寳藏，爲量之富，足使美國人不必仰給於國外來源。</p>
<p>當美國正在集中力量收買世界每一角落的鈾鑛時，蘇聯也從事於開發他們自己境內的寳藏。因爲蘇維埃聯邦共和國佔有地球面積的六分之一，關於蘇聯產鈾足以自給的一回事，便不成什麽問題了。</p>
<p>今年，蘇聯歷史上最大的探礦運動已經開始了。據華盛頓郵報的莫斯科專電透露出，這探礦工作包括一百五十架飛機，三千輛摩托卡，和六千隊馬車在從事這任務。儘管蘇聯對於探尋的結果，迄今仍嚴守秘密，但有若干事實則已爲人所共知。例如南土耳其斯坦（South　Turkeotan），烏拉爾山（The　Ural），遠東的貝加爾湖（Leke　Baikal）和其他蘇聯領土之內的不少地方，都有很多的鈾鑛苗存在。</p>
<p>最近合衆社的電報又說，德國著名的一位原子能學家邦開博士（Dr．Bamke）已經應允和世界聞名　蘇聯物理學家卡比薩博士（Dr．Peter　Kapitza）共同進行原子能的硏究。據邦開博士稱：蘇聯可能自南土耳其斯坦所獲得的鈾，巳製成若干實驗性的原子彈云。</p>
<p>此外，在蘇聯佔領下的歐洲，據說也發現了鈾鑛。例如，有些吿說在埃爾斯山（The　Frz　Mountains）就有鈾鑛發現，但邦開博士表示，德國政府從一九四〇年至一九四五年也在那區域搜尋鈾鋤而沒有成功。但消息不斷傳米，均稱這一個區域已被禁止隨意進出。據聯合社電訊，德國地質學家魯滋博士（Dr．Walter　Lvtz）曾稱在那地區含着已知僅有歐洲的教大鈾藏。另外有些還不能證實的報導說在沿着德捷邊境有十萬名蘇聯人和德國人在從事採鈾工作。　捷克的謝克莫夫（Jachymov）鑛，以含有豐富的鈾而著稱，事實上居禮夫人第一次發現的鈾，即係自此處所得的兩噸重的瀝靑中提煉出來者。捷克政府稱，彼無意作原子的硏究，且現時並無已經開採的鈾鑛可供輸出，惟捷克顯然是在蘇聯的掌握之中。</p>
<p>除了美蘇兩國之外，還有不少中立的國家也有着鈾藏，不過鑛苗還不能開始售賣。</p>
<p>法國就是一個這類的國家。它本國和馬達加斯卡島（Madagscar）都有鈾鑛，不過他們本國的原子能硏究家在整個的法國領土上都在搜索着。法國原子能工作技術指導克華斯博士（Dr．Kwath）說有六十到七十個人員在從事這種工作。</p>
<p>瑞典盛傳蘊藏着不少的鈾鑛，混在泥板岩（Shale　Rock）裏面。瑞典政府在戰事期中，因爲煤及煤油的進口中斷，開始在國內開鑿油井，那時就發現了鈾鑛。</p>
<p>去年一月間，美國化學協會石油部主席愛格羅甫博士（Dr．Guotav　Egloff）赴瑞典考察歸國時說，他們的放射性鑛物的泥板岩裏，約有二十萬噸鈾鑛存在。</p>
<p>數有之後，具有權威　英國科學　誌宇由報載稱，瑞典已經組織了一個瑞典原子委員會，設計一所實驗性的原子能製造廠的方案。</p>
<p>挪威，阿根廷都有鈾發現，挪咸並也成立了一個原子委員會。</p>
<p>南澳洲據也有相當豐富的鈾鑛，足供現今動力一百年之用。</p>
<p>墨西哥，巴西，紐西蘭和其他許多國家，皆稱在其國境內有鈾鑛發現。此外，印度的特勒凡科亞（Travancore）以產釷（Thorium）聞名。最近英國和智利阿根庭兩國爭福克蘭島的主權，爲的就是鈾鑛。</p>
<p>將來，科學界可能找出很多的礦物來作原子能的原料。不過目前爲止，自然界中祗有一種材料合於此用，是即鈾中的U—235。不過U—233可以自釷提悚出來。主要的釷礦是在法國境內。</p>
<p>法國的這種礦造成了同盟國在第二次大戰　的一個最恐懼的問題。因爲深恐德國會予以利用。</p>
<p>據說中國新疆境內有鈾鑛的存在，廣西也有鈾鑛，正預備勘測中。</p>
<p>雖然，現在這種鬥爭正開始在進行着，侮個國家都知道鈾的價値和重要了。聯合國原子能委員會也議定了祗允許在和平時期應用原子能的原則，可是鈾的鬥爭，正繼續不斷的在進行着。</p>
<h3>原子能在和平時期的貢獻</h3>
<p>— 癯叟譯</p>
<p>綜上所述的技術上與經濟上的各點看來，我們的結論是，在一般工業發達的回家中，用原子能發生動力可以成爲一種次要的能力來源；但即使目前的燃料價格再漲上百分之五十的話，鈾仍不致於成爲主要的能原。</p>
<p>使用鈾發生動力，對於工人將產生極大的影響，尤其是煤礦工人。若是目前　煤價繼續高漲時，那末有一部份大型的工廠，便祇得被迫採用鈾作動力了。這樣一來，一般煤礦公司將不得不盡力使產量增加，另一方面，煤亦可以改作其他更合理的用途。</p>
<p>當某一工業中的工資過高，因而使出品的價格提高時，人們便會採用其他一向認爲太貴的代替品或代替方法。在第塞爾引擎發明以後，火車的電力化便因此停頓。而在印桐業中，每次在工人要求增加工資時，便促成一種新的印刷方法，如排字鑄版機，自動鑄版機，鉛版機，和更快的印刷機。如果人類能具有較今日更好的擊破原子的方法，和更好的使用原子能的方法，那實在是値得慶幸的事，因爲現在人類的使用煤和油作燃料，可說是一種罪惡；這兩樣東西，都應該被用來作化學工業上的原料，而不應作燃料。從這些原料上，我們可以製造出冲洗照相的藥料，治病的藥料，以及可與天然的產品相媲美的人造香水，香精，和人造染料；但是現在這大量的原料却都被我們付諸一炬了。祇有人類在達到使用原子能的時代後，我們才能充分地利用這些原料。</p>
<p>燃料的價格將爲決定何時何地可以建築原子能工廠的主要因素。所以像巴西等國家，在原子能時代中將可以成爲大業國。巴西富於鐵礦沙和錳，但缺少煤，可是多釷，這是另一種具有放射性的原素，可以與鈾同樣地用來產生能力。所以巴西可以成爲鋼鐵業極發達的國家。在另一方面言，要在熱帶區內的島嶼上使用原子能，便很少有可能性。因爲在這鄰近赤道的一圈內，燃料雖不豐富，却多日光，使用日光的熱和能，當然是最便宜最有利的事。</p>
<p>鈾在被衝擊後具有極大的爆炸力，有人稱之爲原子炸藥。因此人們便問，在開掘運河，開鑿山洞或掘地打樁時，是否可以使用鈾。這也是個値得考慮的問題。最需要注意的，當然又是放射</p>
<p>用含有放射性的同位素，可以使醫生觀察生物體中的各種情形。在美國國立健康學院中，科學家們現在已能用含放射性的金屬附着在細菌體上，因此能觀察細菌與體內產生的抗毒素如何搏鬥的情形。烟草毒菌現在已能如此地附着牢作觀察之用，其他各種病毒如流行性感冒和小兒麻痺症等，都有希望能做到這一步。</p>
<p>一部份含放射性而又具有選揮性的同位素，已被用來對付癌症。這些同位素在注射入人體之後，便會使生有惡瘤的一部份發光，而不波及健康的部份，數犬之後，再漸漸退去。</p>
<p>這並不是憑空虛構，過甚其詞，在美國加利福尼亞大學中已發現有數種具短時期放射性的原素和化合物，兼具上述的選擇性，因此用含放射性的鈣來對付癌症，已是可能的事。</p>
<p>美國聖路易的巴奈特免費皮膚癌症治療院（Barnard　Free　Skinand　Cancer　Hospital）中，使用含放射性原素的結果，使醫師們對於如何治療充血性心力衰竭症（Congestive　heartfailure）有更大的成功。白血病，淋巴瘤，何杰金氏病（Hosgin＇s　disease），和各種癌症，都可用含放射性的金來治療。含放射性的原素，且能附着於紅血球上，經過人身全體，使醫師們對於冠狀動脈的血栓形成症（Coronary　thrombosis）有更深切的瞭解。使用含放射性的鐵，可以使我們知道一個人身體內造成紅血球的速率，和人體如何吸收利用鐵質，因此醫師對治療貧血症亦將更有把握。此外含放射性的原素更可以附着在配尼西靈和其他藥物上，故不久以後，醫藥界將可以知道這些藥物如何撲滅或抑制病菌。在植物方面，檀香山的布爾博士使用含放射性的二氫化碳，而知道了甘蔗中放射糖分的情形。</p>
<p>有些同位素並不能在原子能工廠中得到，所以仍要依賴原于擊破機。但是現在大部份同位素已能大量獲得，听以以前祗有少數科學家能在這方面作硏究工作，今後却可以有大量的人員在生物學及生理學方面，作生物體內的新陳代謝和其他各種現象的探討工作。</p>
<p>所以使用原子能以後，我們將不致有工業與社會的革命，而可能在生物學與生理學方面發生一互大的革命。原子衝擊後產生的同位素，在製造原子彈的過程上雖然絕無關係，但却是數百年來人類所發現的最重要的研究工具。在最優秀的科學家集中使用性的問題。在原子能工廠中，我們還可以用適當的建築來防禦這放射性，可是在山石等地方使用鈾來爆炸，那末所發出的放射性便附着在四散的石塊上。一九四五年在美國新墨西哥試驗第一顆原子彈地點的土地，在數星期之後仍舊具有放射性；比基尼海灣中用作目標的軍艦，在試驗之後幾個月仍舊帶着放射性。在我們開掘一個山洞時，使用小量的鈾或許比使用其他炸藥有效，但是這些散開的石塊也許要一年之後才能移去，所以工　師們仍將沿用舊有的方法而不致於使用鈾。至於在開　金，銀，銅和其他金屬礦時，更不宜使用原子能。祇有在開礦時　岩山的機器上，使用原子能才有較大的可能。</p>
<p>放射性是使人類不能立刻使用原子能的最大障礙，但是它亦給人類很大的幫助。鈾二三五在被擊破伊便不再是鈾，而產生　和Krypton，（一種稀有的氣體），碳，或其他原素，這些產査品者具有放射性，其時間自數秒至數月不等。這些具有放射性的原素，呌做「同位素。（Isotopes）。所謂同位素，則在原子序數表上同一地位的原素，但其實際重量則與本來的原素不同。在原子序數表上最輕有原素是氫，最重的是鈾，其間許多原素，都有它們的變體，如氫有三種，即氫一，氫二，氫三，此外如鉛，碳鎭等都有同位素。它們的重量不同，含帶放射性的能力也不同。同位素在製造成原子彈以前多年，即已在原子擊破器中獲得，但是在一堆　受沖擊後所產生的同位素，價格旣廉，分量又多，所以是極好的來源。例如氫是構們用含有重氫的脂肪餵一隻老鼠，那末便可以設法發現氫貯藏在它身體的那一部份，而身體如何使用它。含有重氫的脂肪與含有普通氫的脂肪重量不同，所以很容易分辨。從這方法上，科學家發現以前人類對身體如何耗用脂肪的雅想是錯誤的。而在氮的同位素作追踪齊之後，我們又已獲得許多關於人體如何將蛋白質（其中含有氮）吸收而變成身體一部份的知識。</p>
<p>從橡嶺出來的含有放射性的同位素，已成爲極受歡迎的恩物。含放射性的碘，可以治甲狀腺的各種變態症。，以前從原子擊破機中獲得時，這種碘要一千六百美元一劑，現在從橡嶺得來祗消數元便可，含放射性的磷，以前要二美元一單位，目前紙要三角二分。</p>
<p>含放射性的同位素硏究之下，醫藥，生物學，農作學，物理，化學皆將有新的發展，甚至冶金術與工業亦將間接受到利益獲得進步。（人類將可以製造較今日的金屬更硬數倍的金屬）。所以在談論到使用原子能時，最大的利益恐怕還在擊破原子時的副產品上面。</p>
<p>美國杜魯門在國際癌症研究大會上宣稱，含有放射性的同位素即將從美國輸出供世界各國的生物學界與醫藥界作硏究之用。此舉對於美蘇的原子能管制問題，雖然絕無影響，但是却大大有助於恢復國際間科學知識的自由交換，可以打破已往數年中各國科學界閉關自守的自私態度。（續完）</p>

<h3>單雌生殖子裔的性別決定（續）</h3>
<p>— 謝冶英</p>
<p>（B）雙組染巴體的單雌生殖（Diploil　parthenog，eneis）</p>
<p>像蚜虫，輪虫，介殼虫，葡蛛，竹節虫，等，牠們行單雌生殖的卵子，並不經减數分裂，槪具有雙組染色體數。詳言之，此種單雌生殖之子裔，其體內各細胞所具之染色體數完全與母體相同，無怪都是雌體了。不過事實上雙組染色體的單雌生殖，也未必盡屬雌裔，有些種類的動物，旣能產生雌裔，復能產生雄裔，這眞是生物奇妙之處，爲便於說明記，再分別爲雙組染色體的雌裔單雌生殖和雙組染色體的兩性裔單雌生殖兩類各舉例說明於下：</p>
<p>（A）雙組染色體的雌裔單雌生殖：若干種動物，在其一生間，似乎只行單雌生殖，子裔盡屬雌性，不見有雄性的種類，例如寄牛於植物莖葉上的介殼虫，其生活習慣，頗與蚜虫相類似，其間就有多種專以單雌生殖繁衍其後代的。輪虫中之Belloidse，全係雌體所組成，雄體則至今迄未發見，亦專以單雌生殖繁衍其後代。昆虫類直翅目之竹簡虫（Clonopsigalliea），常見於歐洲者，亦只有雌體。結草虫（Solenobis）平時亦只有雌體。凡此類平日只見雌體的動物，行單雌生殖的結果，子裔均屬雌性。溯其原因，乃由於母體內之成熟卵，未經减數分裂。子裔旣具母體同樣等量的染色體數，演發成之子裔自應屬雌性了。</p>
<p>更奇特的例要算蚜虫了，蚜虫每年的生命史中，有營單雌生殖的世代，也有營兩性生殖的世代，這兩個世代是更番輪廻的。牠們的單雌生殖，旣可作爲雌裔單雌生殖的代表，也可作爲兩性裔單雌生殖的代表，茲略叙其一年間的生活史如下：</p>
<p>每當春初發見之蚜虫，均爲無翅而營單雌生殖之雌虫（Parthenogeneticfemale）。雌虫長成後，、即行單雌生殖，由未經減數分裂之卵，以胎生法產出雌裔。雌裔長成，更爲母體，而復行單雌生殖而胎生雌裔，（代表雙組染色體的雌裔單雌生殖），如是繼續數代，直至秋間最後一代的母虫，其卵子或有不經减數分裂者，則成爲有翅之兩性雌虫（Bisexualfemale），兩性雌虫，並非本身兼有雌雄兩性，而是指，由於這種雌虫所產之卵子，是凖配與精子配合而行兩性生殖的。此種卵子，均經减數分裂，故成熟卵內，僅含單組（n）染色體。如果秋間最後一代母虫之卵子，僅减其一個或二個染色體，因此成熟卵內成爲n—1（2）時，此種卵即發育而成雄裔，（代表雙組染色體的兩性裔單雌生殖）雄裔所生之生殖細胞，經减數分裂後，生出兩種精子，一種含n染色體者，另一種含n—1（2）染色體者。僅含n染色體之精子可與卵子配合。（含n—1（2）之精子，終遭退化）成爲受精卵以越冬，直至翌春，再演發成母虫，復營單雌生殖（註三），茲再將其一年間之生活史，列表於下：（見圖一）</p>
<p>由上表觀，可知蚜虫春季之單雌生殖，實爲雙組染色體的雌裔單雌生殖，而入秋後最末一代之單雌生殖，乃爲雙組染色體的兩性單雌裔生殖。經過這一代後便入於兩性生殖之世代。受精卵越冬至翌春復演發爲單雌生殖之母虫。</p>
<p>以下更論雙組染色體的兩性裔單雌生殖。</p>
<p>（b）雙組染色體的兩性裔單雌生殖：此種單雌生殖，除上述之蚜虫</p>
<p>（圖一）外，像葡蚜這一類中，也己發見有同樣的情形，其所以發生兩性裔的原因，據培爾（Baehr）及毛庚（Morgan）兩氏之報吿如下：</p>
<p>培爾（1908—1909）對於蚜虫之一種名Aphis　saliceti．之研究，發育爲雌體之細胞中有6個染色體，而發育爲雄體的細胞中只有5個。</p>
<p>毛庚（1908—1909）氏在葡蚜之一種名Phylloxera　carydedoauois之研究，亦獲同類的事實，雌裔細胞中有6個染色體，雄裔細胞中只有5個。原來行單雌生殖之雌葡蚜的親體，其所產生之卵，在成熟分裂時並不經减數分裂，所以產生爲雌裔的卵中，依然是6個染色體，但是發育爲雄裔的卵，不僅外觀體積略小，而且在成熟分裂之際，曾被排出了一個X染色體，流落於極體與卵之間，結果使卵中只留有5個染色體，因此就發育成雄體。與X染色體決定性別之原理恰相符合，其生殖輪廻與染色體變動之情形如下：（見圖二）</p>
<p>上表以“A”代表普通染色體，以X代表性染色體。</p>
<p>（C）單雙組染色體輪廻之單雌生殖（Alternately　Hapldid　and　Diploi　parthenogenesis）</p>
<p>像輪虫這一類動物，不僅是單雌生殖與兩性生殖兩個世代更番輪廻，而且牠們的單雌生殖，有時是雙組染色體的，有時是單組染色體的。染色體爲雙組時，則演發成之後嗣爲雌裔，染色體爲單組時，則演發成之後嗣爲雄裔，單雙組染色體之單雌生殖交迭輪　，故子裔或雄或雌。輪虫當環境適宜時，營單雌生殖，所產之卵，均不經减數分裂而演發成雌裔。至環境適宜時，所生之卵，悉行减數分裂，故僅含半數之染色體，此種卵如經受精，遂成含有雙組染色體之受精卵，演發成雌輪虫。若含半數染色體之卵，不經受精而單獨發育者，悉成爲雄綸虫。因爲像輪虫這一類的單雌生殖。兼具單組染色體與雙組染色體兩種型式。而且是更番輸廻的。所以只好另列一類，稱爲單雙組染色體輪廻之單雌生殖了。（未完）（圖二）</p>

<h3>哀莫大於心死</h3>
<p>— 靖文</p>
<p>在前一篇生命與文化的短文中，我僅提出了應以新的生活方式以革新社會風氣，冀充實生活文化而使我們的國家民族獲得新的血液，新的生命。但寫得太抽象了一些，現在想補充一些意思。</p>
<p>今日社會風氣的墮落與人民心理的普遍消沉，是不容否認的事實。可是對於實際的見解則就不　相同了。譬如有一部份主張革新社會風氣的人，認爲跳舞是墮落的行爲，所以得禁。我個人對此無甚意見，因爲我與此無緣，也不感興趣。但我認爲今天値得注意的社會問題，實在不是禁舞或禁娼等枝節問題。</p>
<p>像跳舞這類的行爲，也許可以致一部份醉生夢死者流於精神生活的麻痺狀態，但跳舞的本身並非是罪惡行爲，其所被目爲罪惡者，衹是社會本身不健全的結果而己。</p>
<p>語云哀莫大於心死，我個人認爲今天最嚴重的一個社會現象，就是心理的低調。其最大的徵象，即是人與人間衹有利害而沒有是非觀念。這見諸生活行爲的，就是自私，不負責任和無厭的貪婪。無論在工農商學的那一界，都可以舉出無窮的例子</p>
<p>譬如說，敎育工作是神聖的事業，在歐美國家的高級學府，就等於是國家民族的精神堡壘，即使是鄉僻區域的小學校，也是當地人民精神生活的中心。學校不僅敎育學生，且亦指導人民。過去我們鄉間的私塾學校，還多少能獲得鄉人的尊敬，但自從有了所謂「學店」以來，斯文早已掃地，學生與學校間的關係衹有買實關係。費用高昂，固生活環境使然，尙有可原，但可悲的是師資的貧乏和敎育方針的缺如。負責的敎師雖尙不乏其人，但濫竽充數的則更多。尤其可怕的是師道的墮落。像去年南市發生的某小學校長强姦未成年的女學生事件，就證明了師道墮落程度的可怕。</p>
<p>話且到此爲止，反正個人見得到的，大家也早已司空見慣了，但可怕的却正就在大家已司空見慣，視若當然，心理上早已麻痺了。今天的社會症狀，正就在這一點。</p>
<p>以上云云，說得也許太嚴重了一些，但並不是說已無可救藥，因爲情形雖然暗淡，却還未至絕望。精神病學家對於精神麻痺症的治療方法，不外是勸病人多換新鮮環境，此外是略服一些興　劑。這對於社會精神的麻痺，也是一樣。所不同是精神麻痹病者僅須變換環境，而對於社會精神的麻痺，則非創造新的生活環境不可。</p>
<p>言雖未能盡意，但我寫此文的心意是誠懇的。</p>
<h3>北平的燈市</h3>
<p>— 劉雁聲</p>
<p>每逢春節期間，各地由於風俗的關係，例有燃燈慶祝新年之舉。我們看到水滸傳上，宋江攻打大名府，時遷火燒翠雲樓，大名府內在上元佳節，紮起兩座鰲山，晚間燈火齊明，充分表現出來與民同衆的意思，這就是燈市了。</p>
<p>各地燈市，情形不大一樣，談到北平燈市，由來很久，各朝代都有文字紀載，以太略言之，燈市的起始，是在漢代，而極盛則在明。劉侗帝京景物略，曾說之很詳。洪容齋的容齋三筆上也　上元張燈一則，說明燈市起自漢代，並且說明自宋朝因種種關係，改爲五夜，後又增至七夜。這樣周詳賅備的季節例行事情，　民間的力量很大。孟元老的「東京夢華錄」，周必大「平園續　」，都有燈市起始及實在的繁華情形。北平的燈市，據「燕都遊覽志」，「天咫偶聞」等書記載，可以知道燈市在當初是北平春節期間一種繁華行事，而燈市所在地，又不一樣，並不是在一個地方，述覽志云：「燈市在東華門王府街東，崇文街西，亘二里許，相對皆高樓，夜則燃燈於上，望如風衢。」又據「天咫偶聞」載：「每上元五夕，西馬市之東，東四牌樓下，有燈棚數架，又各店肆高懸五色燈球，如珠琲，如霞標，或間以各色紗燈，由燈市以東至東四牌樓止，相銜不斷，每逢初月乍升，街塵不起，士女雲集，童稚歡呼。」至　燈市中的燈的情態，「京師風俗志」中有詳細記載，如：「其燈有大小，高矮，長短，方圓等式，有紗紙，琉璃，羊角，西洋之別，其繪人物，則列國三國，西遊封神，水滸志異等圖，花卉則蘭菊梅桂萱竹牡丹，禽獸則鸞鳳龍虎以至馬牛鷄犬，與魚蝦虫蟻等圖，無不顏色鮮美，妙態逼眞，品目殊多，頗難枚舉。而最奇者爲冰燈，以冰琢成人物花鳥蟲魚等像，冰以　固之，日久不消。雕刻玲瓏，觀者嘉賞。」這樣奇巧各樣的燈，在街市上懸掛起來，的確是如白香山的詩，所謂「燈火家家市，笙歌處處樓」的描寫，無怪乎「誰家見且能閒坐，何處聞燈不看來」了！</p>
<p>北平燈市的所在地，前引的燕都遊覽志，既然說是在北平東華門王府街東，淸査初白「人海記」也說是在內城「東華門外」，此地即現在的燈市口」，如今雖然燈市久廢，如是例年懸燈，檠已另換了地方，但是這個地方仍存在燈市口的名稱，一望而知是明代燈市的所在地。在淸代燈市，差不多移在前門以外，據「水曹淸暇錄」謂：「近年上元張燈，惟前門外各大店中，及西河沿綢緞舖人參舖打磨廠，東西江米巷中，稍有可觀。」這種情况，到了現在，每年還是這樣，不過燈有繁簡而已。現在仍存的如前門外大柵欄瑞蚨祥的三國燈畫，東鴻記西鴻記的水滸列國，以及廊房頭條各燈畫店的燈，都能够引動遊人駐足圍觀，所畫的人物風景，特別細緻。前門以外，就是地安門外的小門薑店，陳列麥子燈，冰燈等等，也是一時奇觀。在早年北平上元觀燈，因人多擁擠的原故，發現不少笑話，都是市井之輩，趁亂做出來的。民國以來，燈市不禁，然每年遺失物件的很多，這　是北平春節一點特殊點綴。</p>
<p>今年北平以物價關係，特別懸燈者，大槪不能多見，只不過以舊有之物，例行懸掛，點綴一番而已，如果再求諸過去的盛况，則不可再得了。「石湖樂府」中有咏燈市一長首，中有句云：「燕台今古繁華地，偏愛元宵燈影戲，春前臘後好天晴，已向街頭作燈市。」這樣的記載和描寫，已然是歷史上的痕跡了。</p>
<h3>若有所失</h3>
<p>— 津津</p>
<p>世界上能够感動人的事，不一定是原子彈的爆炸，極盡悲歡離合能事的戀愛事蹟，或者如義買房屋獎券中獎等意外幸運。有時，日常生活中的小節，同樣能使人發生若有所失的感覺。</p>
<p>一直到現在，我的腦中還留着一幅鮮明的圖畫。那時正是緊接着去年聖誕節的第二天的淸晨，最多衹有六時半左右，因爲我是歡喜早起便出門的。在我穿過江西路福州路口的時候，迎面看見一個穿紅衣服的淸道夫，推着一輛垃圾車過來，在這垃圾車的頂上，不相稱的倒着一顆剪裁整齊的聖誕樹，灑金的紙條等裝飾品，在晨光微曦中，還閃閃發光。可是它的命運，却已須與垃圾廢物等同流合汚了。諺云「人老珠黄不値錢」，照此聖誕樹看來，珠無須到「黄」的時候，只要它的主人別有所愛時，它的末日就在眼前</p>
<p>另一次，將時間推回至十餘年以前，我尙在中學唸書，因爲我自小就有早起的習慣，在某一天大雪紛飛的早晨，我同樣在六時左右出門了。街上白茫茫的一片，積雪將柏油路和石子街完全掩沒了。因此，積雪上留下的足跡，特別顯得分明，稀稀疎疎的，恰巧顯出有人已比我先在這條街上走過。在這樣冷淸淸的早晨，迎面的風，刺耳如刀割，誰肯離開溫暖的被窩在外奔波呢？將當時的我丢開不論，除須爲衣食奔走而外，似頗令人費解的，但是正可反映生活迫人之甚了。</p>
<p>一般說來，凡是流露眞情的塲合，都能引起我們的共鳴。我們實際生活中，缺乏這一類經驗時，在描寫逼眞的小說和電影中，也可體會不少令人可歌可泣的境界。我想讀過「孤星淚」的人，一定爲書中主角楊伐揚的犧牲一己，獻身人羣的偉大人格所感召。而在一齣悲劇發展至高潮時，至少有不少女觀衆沾濕了她們的小手帕。就筆者而論，數年前在秋海棠一片中見到李麗華一人所飾母女二角，別後重逢，女兒從一面着衣鏡中，見到她的母親冉冉前來，似幻似眞。又如魂斷藍橋一片中，羅勃泰勒參戰歸來，在車站上和費雯麗相値，這時後者已有一段難以言宣的傷心史，一肚子的話，不知從何說起。這兩個鏡頭，不禁使筆者爲之酸鼻呢。</p>
<h3>不同凡響</h3>
<p>— 允恭</p>
<p>人類　基本慾望之一，據一位南加利福尼亞州大學教授伊凡博士的分析，在「超過一般水準以上」（Alove　the　average），譯得中國化一些，就是「不同凡」。</p>
<p>據說每一個美國人都想另外做一些（傑出的）人物（Every　ody　want，to　be　somebody），其實，天下滔滔者皆是也，國人何獨不然。小工想做「那摩溫」，商店職員想做「阿大」，大學畢業生以能至海外鍍金爲榮。退一步說，就是那些以恬淡自命退休林下的鉅公而論，何嘗不以閑適的生活，以示與「熙來攘往」的芸芸衆生有別　？</p>
<h3>逍遥花</h3>
<p>— 陳慎言</p>
<p>第十章　自願犧牲　（七七）</p>
<p>渚齋正要起身下床，小王媽已走進來，說道：「請睡吧，不是老板回來。」渚齋道：「是誰來了？」小王媽道：「是送牛奶的。」渚　聽了，重復躺下，小王媽道：一天亮了，我不在這裏，讓　好睡一會。」說着笑一笑走出去。渚齋因糊裏糊塗混過一夜，沒得休歇，現在天已亮了，綺紈還沒消息，乾着急也是無益，小王媽一走，把被蒙頭一蓋，此時心神略靜，竟睡着了。及到醒時巳是九點多鐘，草草用了一些點心，趕到銀行，在銀行幾個鐘頭，連打好次電話査問小王媽，老板回來沒有，那邊回說還美回來。一直到下午下班，趕到綺紈家裏，見門外停了一輛奶油色新型汽車，車內司機穿着軍裝，不知來了什麼人。急走進門，正過着小王媽，手裏拿着臉盆，正要上樓。一見渚齊進來，點點頭道：「老板回來了。」渚齋一喜，急往樓上便闖，小王媽輕聲阻止道：「別上去，樓上有客呢！」渚齋呆了一呆，問道：「是誰呀？」小王媽道：「我也不認得，是老板和他同來的，等他走了，你再上去。」渚齋聽了，不由自主地，覺得一股酸勁，由脚根直達腦門，不聽小王媽阻止，一直趕到樓上，向客室　外一望，見綺紈正和一位軍裝客人，同坐在沙發上談話。（本章完）</p>
<p>第十一章　滿腹疑雲</p>
<p>原來綺紈和李曼英在濟南靑島露演歸來，由曼英介紹認識一位繆忠傑處長，忠傑白晤見綺紈之後，非常拳拳，三番四次要到綺紈家裏來消遣，都被綺紈拒絕。曼英見綺紈固執，得懇切地勸過幾次，說這位繆忠傑處長，是由南方新來的，在北平有相當勢力，不能得罪他，並且他手筆極大，能哄他高興，很可以敲個大竹槓。綺紈因不久要和渚齋結婚，不願再和他來往，雖經曼英數次勸吿，始終沒有答應，這天因神經受了相當激激，便想要力踐對毓如的諾言，斷絕渚齋的念頭，只有和繆忠傑來往可以激怒渚齋，使他自行脫離關係。綺紈當時在神經極度激盪，也未細加考慮，出門之後，便一逕往找曼英，表明意思。曼英正為這事怕得罪了忠傑，一聽綺紈肯移樽就敎，非常高興，連忙打電話，通知忠傑，忠傑便約他二人到六國飯店晚餐，綺紈明知忠傑約她到六國飯店，不懷好意，但此來旣抱犧牲觀念，便沒什麼畏怯的，和曼英到六國飯店之後，忠傑注意綺紈已久，今天幸有機緣，當然不肯放鬆，力獻殷勤。</p>
<p>就我們的日常生活觀之，無形　處處受「希望不同凡響」的這條原則的支配。我們愛吸三九牌，或「烟味醇和」的價値美金一角的雪茄；我們愛高談闊論，以示學識的淵博和發揮獨到的見解；我們看不起好萊塢一味胡鬧的武俠片和野獸片，連帶對「唯低級趣味是尙」的觀衆，發生賤視心理，如果經濟能力許可的話，我們自然歡喜住「煤，電，衛，話」全備的洋房，穿着質料高貴，剪裁講究的衣服，出則有汽車代步；而我們這些物質上的慾望，很可能受崇尙淸靜無爲的學者的卑視。這些學者們正以「衆醉獨醒」，「超凡絕俗」或「入汚泥而不染」自詡。歸根結底，也許是另一種祈求「不同凡響」的潛意職在作祟而已。</p>
<p>世人往往追求「出類拔萃」而不可得，在正途上走不通，不得不別出蹊徑，此在好奇心理特甚的美國爲尤著，例如有一位美國作家在身上懸了一塊紙牌上書「出售美金，每一元衹售七角五分」，雖是蝕本生意，却能惹起行人注目。又如好葉塢有新片上演時，電影公司當局必設法使紐約記者，從長途電話中訪問遠在加里福尼亞的片中主角，彼此交談的限於氣候好歹等無關輕重的瑣事，但是即此長途電話通話一端，頗足以轟動一時了。</p>
<p>我又從記述　約生活的若干隨筆體的文字中，知道紐約女人好佩橡皮製的「假胸」，揆其用意，未嘗不在求得「不平凡」的美麗。我每逢讀到上述一類的例子時，心中往往有一種幽默和悲哀雜揉在一起的說不出的况味。</p>
<h3>憶儲南强先生</h3>
<p>— 俞劍華</p>
<p>昨閱凌霄漢閣「吾邑宜興」一文，提及儲南强先生，認爲不愧南方之强。余之識南强先生，係由前輩蔣竹莊先生之介，其時爲民國二十年左右，先生方傾力繕治張公善權兩洞，特專函邀余遊覽。余於春假之暇，偕畫弟子徐培基，由無錫轉宜興，暢遊兩洞，並及其他名勝，蒙南强先生招待甚殷。別後雖數通音問，竟無再見之緣，抗戰期間，風聞從率游擊，與敵搏鬥，每遇宜人，便加探詢，惜未知其詳。</p>
<p>宜興兩洞，在東南各省，允稱奇觀。張公洞分前後二洞，雄壯偉大，廓然有容，頂埀石乳，如佛面纓絡，莊嚴美妙。善權洞分上下二洞，上洞冬暖夏凉，冬日暖氣滿洞，遊者入必卸裘，夏日則冷氣森然，遊者入必加衣，洞外愈冷則洞內愈熱，洞外愈熱則洞內愈冷；下洞則曲折幽邃，一半為陸，一半爲水，有小舟可通，石壁巉巖，石乳累　，呈各種奇形異相。</p>
<p>兩洞旣擅勝東南，南强先生以爲欲振興宜興商業，繁榮宜興市而，莫過於繕治兩洞，以爲號召，遊人　集，則交通商業旅館各方必盛，於是傾十年之力，罄其家財，以鑒以闢，以築以建。財力不足，其媳斥奩裝以益之，其熱心毅力，誠足以使人感動，兩洞之名，因以大彰，遊人確因之增加不少。</p>
<p>南強先生道德學問，久爲儕輩所欽佩，其繕治兩洞，又完全出於爲邑造福之熟誠，動機之佳，實無可非議，惟南强先生個性甚强，大有愚公移山之風，而對於審美觀念，頗爲缺乏，因之兩洞自然之美，不免有所損傷，而一切建築不免醜惡，與自然風景，無法配合，用力雖勤，半屬浪費，同遊之人，多具此感。但鑒於南强先生之興高采烈，又不敢進言。抗戰以後，兩洞情形，滄桑變遷，又不知成何景象矣。</p>
<p>南强先生體格極健，年已花甲而矯健　鑠，英氣逼人，所御皮鞋，底鑲鐵板，每隻三斤，日御此鞋，隨余等上下山洞，健步如飛。家在宜興北門內，客廳中懸舊式紅燈四盞。每佳客　止，優予招待者，則必高呼「點紅燈」，以爲暗號，家人聞之知爲上賓，即具盛饌，否則知爲普通客人，以常食供客矣。書室中書籍字畫骨董，羅列殆滿，所藏竹根刻成之酒器，即有數十種之多。有一長不盈尺之鐵獅子，南强先生以之爲枕而眠者數十年。南强先生書法奇肆，喜以極大之筆，寫極小之字，因之模糊不易辨認，得其信（好用明信片）者，往往可費數日　。</p>
<p>聞南强先生在宜興有「土皇帝一之雅號，不知確否，亦可以想見其人苦幹硬幹之精神，緬懷音徽，不禁恨然。</p>
<h3>離婚的理由</h3>
<p>— 無啓</p>
<p>美國米爾華基州一婦人，要求和丈夫離婚，結果勝訴。離婚的理由是：她的丈夫戰時從軍，官階是少校、復員以後，他强迫他的妻子每逢見他時必須高呼「少校」，而且還須行軍禮。</p>
<p>米蘇里州有一婦人要求離婚，因爲她燒好了一盆洋葱排骨佐餐時，他的丈夫總要把那份菜一分爲二，自己專吃排骨，而呌他的妻子專吃洋葱。</p>
<p>匹資堡一婦人要求離婚的原因是：當她生病的時候，她的丈夫呌殯儀舘裏派人來看她，而且還預定了素色花圈。</p>
<h3>大學社會化（下）</h3>
<p>— 吳賡</p>
<p>今日世界各地之大學，學生衆多，校舍多不敷應用，設備多不够運用，師資多不够分配，致呈僧多粥少之像。我國未能例外。竊思：與其採集中制，盍不改爲分散制？今日舞　業已禁止在案，何妨本而約之旨，再進一步，把茶室書塲戲院等等一律予以利用，充作敎育塲所。譬如胡適不妨講演「考據」於「七重天」，馮友蘭儘可敎授「哲學」於「五層樓」，吳經熊不妨講授其「法理學」於「米高美」，顏惠慶儘可講述其「外交回憶錄」於「高樂書塲」。這樣，一方面是解決了學渚講學的塲所，另一方而是提高了社會一般人士敎育的水準。人們之所以消磨大好光陰於傾聽「彈詞名家」的「三笑姻緣」者，因爲沒有較好的方法去安排其光陰也，如果顏惠慶眞的講述其「外交回憶」於書塲，人們那裏會不識好歹，自然是捨前者，而取後者了。</p>
<p>至於學着講授的方法，或可採「演講式」：於規定時間，作公開演講。或可採「候敎式」：坐鎭於某公衆塲所，供一般好學人士之儲詢探討。或可採「突擊式」：隨學者興之所至，驀地出現於某某舞廳，作精明的學術演講。至於作爲酬報的「學費」，或採「門票制」：規定若干票價，欲聽講者，憑票入塲。或採「樂助制」：聽者覺得滿意，便投講演者以若干法幣，數目多寡悉，隨聽者之經濟能力，或其滿意之程度如何而定，或採「混合制」：聽講者除購門票外，如果覺得某學者的學問實在淵博精深，不妨再行出資若干，以助雅興。這樣的敎育才是眞正的「民主敎育」。此外再由國家或私人多多設立完備的圖書　　科學館，大學敎育亦庶幾</p>
<p>我們如果以這　　方式去辦理敎育，這便是「敎育」的社會化；社會之中有這樣濃厚的學術空氣，這便是「社會」的大學化。這樣的大學敎育，社會中士農工商文武人員各色人等均有享受的機會，是其一；人們所事受的不只是四年制的形式敎育，而是終身隨時可以　　無窮的敎育，是其二；沒有年齡與階級上的限制，可謂貧富一律，老少咸宜，是其三：不如形式敎育那樣的有嚴格的時間限制，已就業的人們，一方面仍可從事其職業，另一方面仍可有浸潤於學術空氣的機會，是其四。</p>
<p>在今日的大學敎育制度之下，莘莘學子不惜以整整四年大好光陰化費於所謂「求學」，一箍腦兒的作孤注之一擲，實在是大大的浪費。那些甘願一本正經化四年時間於大學的人們，是把大學看得太偉大了，實則大學並沒有如所相像的那麼神聖。又有些人以爲於大學四年的時間中可以學到所需要的一切，這又太小覷了「敎育」，「敎育」並不是如此的簡單。明乎此理的必會贊成我上述大學大衆化的辦法，必不會護我以跡近幽默的。幸希正人君子，社會賢達，細味吾言。</p>
<p>社會服務</p>

<p>合辦助產</p>
<p>金華豐氏慨助二千八百萬元</p>
<p>盼貧苦孕婦先期申請熱心善士多多捐輸</p>
<p>「貧婦助產」運動，在一月份共計帮助了四十二位窮苦的產婦，其中由人和醫院接生的廿四人，共計二千餘萬元；尙賢醫院十二人，共計三千餘萬元，保黎醫院五人共計四百餘萬元，紅十字會醫院一人，計二百六十餘萬元；四家醫院的接生費用合計是五千七百六十萬一千元，按照合約規定，本報應該負担各該合作醫院接生費用的一半就是二千八百八十三萬零五百元。和十二月份的助產費用比較起來，正月份共計增加了百分之二百左右，這對於全賴讀者捐助的「貧婦助產」運動，的確是一個難以應付的負担。</p>
<p>但是金華豐先生仍舊以過去幾個月的慷慨姿態，帮助我們解決了這個當前難題，換句話說：他獨力償付了這全部費用，計二千八百八十三萬零五百元。我們希望社會上的熱心人士，都能像金先生一樣的樂善好施，使「貧婦助產」運動一天天的擴大起來，使貧苦的孕婦與保赤兩方而都受惠無窮。</p>

<h3>Soviet Suggestions Relayed by Foreign Media: Government Declares Absolutely Untrue, Rumors of Beijing-Shanghai Peace Talks Also Groundless</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 22nd] A telegram from Guling states that the airmail service, the only means of communication between Beijing and Guling, has been suspended for several days due to heavy rain, preventing people in the mountains from reading newspapers from Beijing and Shanghai. On the 22nd, the weather cleared up, and Chairman Chiang and his wife went out for a tour. He was unaware of the rumors of peace talks circulating in Beijing and Shanghai for the past two days, especially the news from the Associated Press.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 22nd] A report from the Shanghai Associated Press states that a Soviet official in China had expressed to our government his willingness to mediate the war to suppress the rebellion and bandits, and that Chairman Chiang had appointed senior officials to agree to resume peace talks. The Executive Yuan authorities have been instructed to issue a statement declaring that this matter is absolutely untrue and purely a groundless rumor intended to disturb public morale.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 22nd] Regarding the Associated Press report that the Soviet Union is mediating the Chinese war, Shi Zhaoying, Director of the Intelligence Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, was instructed to deny the rumor, declaring to reporters: "This news has no basis whatsoever, and the report is absolutely untrue." The TASS branch in Beijing also stated that they had not heard of this matter.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Nanjing, 22nd] Official sources here solemnly stated regarding the suggestion from the Soviet Union to mediate the Chinese civil war that, should such a suggestion be made, China would never consider it. Official sources further expressed disbelief in the possibility of the government resuming peace talks with the Communist Party, as suggested by US Ambassador Stuart earlier yesterday. A Kuomintang official stated that since the Communist Party has become a rebel, the stage of resolving the CCP issue through peaceful means has long passed. Other sources pointed out that there is considerable hope for US aid, even military aid, to pass through the US Congress, making the government even less willing to negotiate with the Communist Party than before. They further pointed out that during last year's Moscow Foreign Ministers Conference, China firmly opposed the Soviet Union's attempt to discuss the China issue with Marshall and Bevin. At that time, the Chinese government believed that since China was not participating in the meeting, matters concerning the Chinese situation should not be included in the agenda. However, the same sources also feared that the Soviet suggestion to resume peace talks would strengthen the CCP's position, as the latter might demand excessive concessions from the government if peace talks were to take place.</p>
<h3>US Ambassador Issues Statement: Denies Making "Reopening of KMT-CCP Negotiations" Remark, Hopes for Close Cooperation Between Chinese Officials, Military, and People</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 22nd] Ambassador Stuart received US reporters in Beijing on the morning of the 22nd and issued a statement explaining his views on the China issue, which are completely consistent with the letter to the Chinese people he published two days ago. His main aim is to encourage unaffiliated and non-partisan people in China to increase their concern for the government and to help the country seek welfare for the people. The Chinese Constitution has already been promulgated, and the people should strive for freedom under the Constitution. In the afternoon, the Ambassador again received Chinese reporters and issued a statement saying that the biggest reason for publishing the letter to the Chinese people a few days ago was the feeling that there had been three glorious achievements in Chinese history in the past 30 years: the overthrow of the Manchu Qing government, the Northern Expedition, and the War of Resistance Against Japan. In these three achievements, on the one hand, the leaders such as Mr. Sun Yat-sen in the past and Chairman Chiang today demonstrated their outstanding talents, and on the other hand, the people were able to unite and exert their strength. After the War of Resistance, most people felt distressed, at a loss, and ignored that China today already has a constitution to define the framework of national affairs. If the people can contribute their own strength under the Constitution, they can help the government complete the modernization of the democratic system. The Ambassador also said that the current problem is that the vast majority of the people have failed to unite under the Constitution to launch a new revolutionary movement.</p>
<p>The Ambassador continued: The Chinese people have shown good performance in the struggle against communism, but their forces are scattered, localized, and not collective and comprehensive. The Chinese people's understanding of communism is very clear. Communism is a representative of authoritarianism, and communism symbolizes the decline of human rights and the loss of humanity. The Chinese people not only have a mind but also an understanding of communism, which is not a problem. The problem is that the Chinese people cannot find a good, democratic, and effective path to struggle. In fact, this path is in front of us, which is the power given to us by the Constitution to reform politics. They are only passively dissatisfied with the current government and have not thought of participating in the government's reform work. How to reform? The most effective way is to gather together. There are many ways. Some people say to form a new political party, but the party must have a correct goal, organized for national democracy. At the same time, they themselves must believe that they can reflect the opinions of the majority of the people and strive for a democratic country. If the original political parties want to continue to survive and have the power, they must serve the majority of the people and lead the people to the right path. If someone asks me (the Ambassador said himself), a new revolutionary movement must have a leader, who is the leader? I can answer: "Chairman Chiang." Because only Chairman Chiang is trusted by the majority of the people, and only Chairman Chiang has the ability to lead the majority of the people. The current problem is that the majority of the people have failed to participate in the road of national affairs and exercise their civil rights. If the Chinese people can all exercise their civil rights, they can make the country焕然一新 and secure stability.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 22nd] US Ambassador to China Stuart, met alone with Feng Guozhen, director of the English Department of the Central News Agency, on the evening of the 22nd, and denied that he had told the Associated Press that "the most likely solution to the China issue is the reopening of negotiations between the KMT and the CCP." The Ambassador narrated his statement in response to the Associated Press reporter, saying: "What I told the Associated Press reporter is the same as the opinion I stated a few days ago. I said that when China is facing such a serious situation, those who love their country, especially educated patriots, seem to have a great opportunity and responsibility to work together to study what is the country's problem, and to awaken and guide the people of the whole country so that they can realize a democratic government. If so, the intellectuals' distrust of the government will surely disappear, and they will support the government and strive for peace in China." The Ambassador continued: "I know that some people have made special efforts before Mr. Gullman (referring to the Associated Press reporter in Beijing) raised special questions, but I don't know the details. I think the United States seems to consistently hope that China can find a way to end the civil war. I think the Chinese people can hope to find a way to unite and solve their various difficulties. I didn't specify what kind of solution or how to solve it. The United States' policy is the same as in the past. The United States is giving China aid in the hope that before China may obtain other fundamental solutions, US aid can give China temporary relief." The Ambassador stated that he had summoned US reporters in Beijing this morning to explain the misunderstanding caused by the Associated Press report. The Ambassador said that the Associated Press reporter had apologized for misunderstanding his statement. The Associated Press reporter himself thought that the paraphrase was correct, but his inference of my statement was absolutely not my original intention. Dr. Stuart continued to answer another question raised by the reporter, saying that the reason why he specifically pointed out intellectuals and educated people is because they have the ability to lead the people. He believes that these people can form a new party and make constructive criticisms of the government, or they can only establish a few groups to advocate some reform proposals and progressive movements. The Ambassador continued that the negative attitude adopted by intellectuals and educated people, such as the professors of some universities, towards the government surprised him very much. He hoped that some of those who criticized the government but had never done anything should actively fulfill their responsibilities under the new constitution to help solve the country's problems. At a time when Americans are paying full attention to the issue of aid to China, they expect China to launch such a progressive movement under the support of its government. The American people have high expectations for this so that their assistance can achieve its maximum effect. In order for the government to assist in the development of this progressive movement, China still needs its people to maintain a consistent spirit of loving the Kuomintang. This spirit was fully demonstrated in the Kuomintang's overthrow of the Manchu Qing Dynasty, the completion of the Northern Expedition, and the leadership of the entire country in the War of Resistance Against Japan. In the Northern Expedition and the War of Resistance, the national public opinion unanimously supported Chairman Chiang. Ambassador Stuart believes that under this spirit, the progressive movement can proceed smoothly. The Ambassador continued: China's communist problem will eventually be resolved. He believes that the pacification of the Communist Party cannot rely solely on military force. The government should also try to eliminate the various factors that can nurture communism. The Ambassador pointed out that there should be close cooperation between the government of each province and the officials, military, and people of each county. He said that because Hebei Province has this kind of cooperation, it feels that it can fully control the situation in the province. The Ambassador said that he learned that the people of Northeast China hate communism, so this kind of cooperation between officials, military, and people is needed to improve the current situation. The Ambassador said that he believes that all problems can be solved, and said that he has always had the highest hope for the Chinese government and has always wholeheartedly supported the Chinese government. He hopes that wise men will give support to the government and help it improve the places that they are not satisfied with. The Ambassador did not mention the leaders of the government and said: "I have the greatest admiration for them. I have known many of them for many years. Compared with officials from other countries, they are really no worse."</p>

<p>[Associated Press, Nanjing, 22nd] The Chinese government will provide aid to Chinese farmers in the amount of 10,000,000,000,000 yuan (approximately US$71,000,000). This proposal follows the decision on a special donation of 10,000,000,000,000 yuan, with the intention of suppressing the rich and helping the poor. This decision was made by the government at a meeting of the Joint Board of Directors, which is co-chaired by Chairman Chiang and Zhang Qun.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 22nd] According to sources concerned: the Central Bank's entrusted to various banks and bureaus to purchase finished products from manufacturers during the Spring Festival holiday has now come to an end. The total value of purchases is 32.4 billion national currency, of which coal accounts for 22.6 billion, and the remaining leather, cigarettes, matches, etc. account for 9.8 billion yuan. The disposal of the purchased finished products will be decided by the head office.</p>
<p>[Our Hankou Dispatch, 22nd] In order to solve the difficulties of industrial loans and coal allocation, the industrial circles in northern Hunan recently appointed Li Jianting and five others to form a petition group, and they are scheduled to set off within days.</p>
<h3>Joint Board of Four Banks Handles Affairs: Reviews Lending Policy</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 22nd] The Joint Board of Four Banks will hold a special review meeting at 9:00 am on the 23rd to review the loan principles and lending policies decided at the Board meeting on the 21st. Zhang Jiaao, Xu Baiyuan, and others will participate. The board will also hold a loan group review meeting in Shanghai on the 23rd, which will be convened by Liu Gongyun. Relevant personnel from the Joint Board of Four Banks have gone to Shanghai to participate.</p>
<h3>US Supplies Materials to Our Air Force: Already Loading Ships on Saipan, 150 Transport Planes Will Fly to China</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 21st] State Department officials said on the 21st that materials supplied to the Chinese Air Force under the contract signed on November 6 were loaded onto several Chinese ships on Saipan last week. According to the contract of December 20, 150 transport planes sold to China will fly to China.</p>
<p>Secretary of State Marshall told the House Foreign Affairs Committee that China began loading munitions onto landing ships in the Mariana Islands on February 14. State Department officials said that the remaining supplies in Hawaii and the munitions contract in the Mariana Islands will be implemented quickly.</p>
<p>It also said that most of the materials have been packed and prepared for shipment.</p>
<p>However, none of the 150 transport planes sold to China have been delivered so far. US military assistance to China's anti-communist forces, including surplus munitions and aircraft, are supplied at greatly reduced prices.</p>
<p>The State Department has sent a memorandum to the House Foreign Affairs Committee, stating that in recent months, several contracts have been approved to sell wartime materials to the Chinese National Government.</p>
<p>This is obviously the State Department's response to Congress' criticism of the newly proposed economic aid to China of $570 million. Some congressmen have said that the plan is very inappropriate because it does not supply military materials, and only supplies aviation gasoline and oils.</p>
<h3>Kowloon Incident Negotiation: Sino-British Agreement Expected</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Nanjing, 22nd] A Foreign Ministry spokesman said on the 22nd that the differences between the Chinese and British governments on the Kowloon issue have "gradually narrowed," and an agreement is expected to be reached within two weeks.</p>

<h3>Australian Government Improves: Regulations on Chinese Immigration, Our External Negotiations Have Results</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 22nd] According to the report from the Western Australia Branch of the Chinese Kuomintang to the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission, requesting negotiations with the Australian government to improve the regulations on Chinese immigration, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs was requested to instruct our minister to Australia to actively negotiate. It is heard that an agreement was reached with the Australian government last year. The improved measures are as follows: (1) Chinese people who do business in Australia and have an annual trade volume of 2,500 Australian pounds can apply for one assistant. Vegetable garden workers with a total trade volume of 750 pounds can also apply for two assistants, and they can stay for five years. After the expiration, they can apply for an extension once. (2) When permanent residents die or retire, those with an annual trade volume of 2,500 pounds can ask Chinese to inherit the business. In the past, there was no such provision. (3) Chinese businessmen who trade in Australia with 500 pounds of capital are considered import and export merchants and can live for seven years. If the capital increases by 500 pounds, they can apply for one more assistant. (4) Chinese people residing in Australia can bring their families and live for five years, and can apply for an extension of five years after the expiration. (5) If Chinese people in Australia need to change their careers, it must be decided by the Chinese Consulate and the Australian Immigration Department. In the past, it was almost not allowed to change careers. (6) Chinese students who go to Australia to study must have their parents in Australia and be between the ages of ten and fourteen before they are allowed to enter the country. Now, as long as there is a guardian who can provide a guarantee deposit of 100 pounds, they can enter the country. Junior high school students can stay for three years, and can apply for an extension when the limit is reached. There is no time limit for college students, and it is purely limited to the completion of the course. The Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission has informed the various overseas Chinese affairs bureaus.</p>

The bandit will restore utilization, now strong 工　　　　　　立屯 railway, about kilometers long.</p>
<p>Yesterday at 6:00 pm, four elders from the Northeast arrived in Shanghai from Beiping. From right to left, Ma Zhanshan, Wan, Zhang Zuoxiang, Zhang Yuanfu. (Photo by Central News Agency)</p>
<h3>Ma Zhanshan and Others Arrive in Shanghai: Say the Situation in the Northeast Is Not as Serious as Reported, Will Go to Beijing Tonight to Meet Chairman Chiang and Discuss Major Plans</h3>
<p>[Our Report] Four Northeastern elders Ma Zhanshan, Zhang Zuoxiang, Wan Fulin, and Zhang Yuanfu, accompanied by several followers, flew to Shanghai from Beiping on a China Airlines "Air King" special plane at 2:50 pm on the 22nd, and arrived at Longhua Airport at 6:05 pm. Shi Bingyan and Shi Weipu, standing directors of the Northeastern Shanghai Fellow Villagers Association, and Wang Defu and others, representatives of the Beijing Fellow Villagers Association, went to the airport to welcome them. After arriving in Shanghai, Ma and others were taken to the board of directors of the China Industrial Bank in Xieqiao Lane by Fu Rulin, president of the bank, for a short rest. According to Ma Zhanshan, they will visit Chairman Chiang in Beijing to discuss major plans for the Northeast, but they did not bring a "suggestion" as rumored outside. The recent situation in the Northeast is not as serious as reported outside, and the military strength in various places is sufficient to maintain local security. As for whether Ma himself will participate in planning the actual military affairs of the Northeast again, it will be decided after the central government's instructions. Regarding Zhang Xueliang's return to power, as of now, there is no sign. Wan Fulin told reporters that he believes that organizing and training the militia is an urgent task in the Northeast. Zhang Zuoxiang said that he has been away from the Northeast for a long time and is not very clear about the local situation. Zhang Yuanfu said that the four of them are scheduled to take a train to Beijing on the evening of the 23rd. Before departure (3:00 pm), they decided to host Chinese and foreign journalists at the board of directors of the China Industrial Bank to report on the current situation in the Northeast.</p>
<p>[Another Dispatch] Northeastern elders Wang Shuchang, Zhai Wenxuan, and Mi Chunlin in Tianjin set sail for Shanghai by ship on the 21st, and are expected to arrive on the 24th, and then transfer to Beijing to meet with Ma and others.</p>
<h3>Chen Cheng Meets Zou Zuohua</h3>
<p>Expresses That There Is No Need to Be Pessimistic About the Situation in the Northeast</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 22nd] Chief of Staff Chen Cheng met with Zou Zuohua at 11:00 am on the 22nd and expressed that the current situation in the Northeast is by no means as difficult as reported outside. The National Army has all the pre-arranged deployments, and it is certain that it can contain the bandit army's offensive, and there is no reason for pessimism. The Northeastern elders suggested strengthening local forces, and the government intends to adopt it. The detailed measures are being studied by the relevant authorities. Wei Lihuang had asked Zou to make a report to Chen Cheng on his behalf, and Zou had relayed it on behalf of Chen during his visit.</p>
<p>[Another Telegram] After arriving in Beijing, Zou Zuohua has successively visited Mo Dehui, Liu Zhe, and other Northeastern elders to exchange opinions, and is scheduled to visit President Zhang on the 23rd to make a report and ask for instructions. According to Zou, he came to Beijing this time to take up the new position of strategic consultant and, at the same time, to discuss with the Northeastern elders the measures to strengthen the military force in the Northeast at the call of the central government. Besides, there are no other tasks. Zou believes that the evolution of the situation in the Northeast to this day is due to the wrong views of the receiving officials, who should bear great responsibility. The official believed that diplomatic negotiations could take over the Northeast. When the people of the Northeast were eagerly looking forward to the government taking over after the victory, peace talks were actively pursued, which led to the increasing strength of the bandits. This also gave the Communists a good opportunity to develop. Now the foundation of the Communists in the Northeast is solid, and it is difficult to eliminate them in the short term, but the Communists' attempt to enter the pass from the Northeast will never succeed. The Sino-Soviet Non-Aggression Pact is Automatically Extended</p>
<h3>Shi Zhaoying Speaks</h3>
<p>The Sino-Soviet Non-Aggression Pact is Automatically Extended</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 22nd] Shi Zhaoying, Director of the Intelligence Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, stated on the 22nd regarding the continued extension of the Sino-Soviet Non-Aggression Pact for two years: The pact was signed on August 21, 1937, and its Article 4 stipulates that the validity period is five years. If either of the contracting parties believes that there is no need to continue, it can notify the other party six months before the expiration (before February 21) to declare its termination, otherwise it will be automatically extended for two years. After the extension of two years, the method of treaty survival will be the same. The pact was automatically extended three times in 1942, 1944, and 1946. This year is another time for decision, but as of the 21st, neither party has submitted a notice declaring termination, so the pact will be automatically extended for another two years after its fourth expiration on August 21 this year, until August 21, 1950.</p>
<h3>Communists Sign Secret Far East Trade Pact with Soviet Union</h3>

<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 22nd] Mayor of Qingdao, Li Xianliang, came to Beijing from Qingdao on the evening of the 21st to request the Central Government to resolve the difficulties of coal and grain shortage in Qingdao and to appeal for the opening of industrial and commercial loans in Qingdao. According to Mr. Li's conversation with reporters on the evening of the 22nd: Qingdao is short of coal and grain, and the number of refugees concentrated in Qingdao is the highest in the country, resulting in three major difficulties in Qingdao. After the loans were stopped, Qingdao's industry and commerce lacked working capital, and many factories are in danger of closing down. (Continued on page 2, column 4)</p>

<h3>Bandits in Western Shandong Crossed the Yellow River and Fled Northward; Bandits Invading Lanfeng in Eastern Henan Were Defeated; Weichuan County Town Recaptured by Troops Yesterday</h3>
<p>[Our Jinan Dispatch, 22nd] One regiment of Chen Yi's bandit troops has crossed the north bank of the Yellow River at Sunkou, and the remaining five regiments are still in southwestern Shandong, where they are being suppressed by the National Army.</p>
<p>[Our Xuzhou Dispatch, 22nd] The 1st, 4th, and part of the 6th regiments of Chen Yi's bandits in western Shandong have been attacked by the National Army for days. Most of them are in the southwestern area of the city, and part of them fled north across the Yellow River from Linji on the 21st.</p>
<p>[Another Dispatch] The 6th Column of Chen Yi's bandit troops, which invaded Lanfeng in eastern Henan, fled southeast on the 21st after being attacked by the National Army.</p>

<h3>Bandit Situation in Residual Areas of Shandong</h3>
<p>[Our Yanzhou Dispatch, 22nd] The bandits who have fled back to southwestern Shandong have increased their numbers to eight columns. Among them, except for parts of two columns, which are still lingering in eastern Henan due to being encircled and suppressed by the National Army, two columns are in the area south of Shanxian County, and another part has returned to the north bank of the Yellow River. The remaining approximately four columns are still wandering in the triangular area north of Heze and Cao County. Chen Yi's headquarters has also fled to Hongchuankou, southwest of Dancheng. Chen Yi's original goal was to be in the Central Plains, but after being severely suppressed by the National Army, he believed that southwestern Shandong was a relatively safe area, so he fled back for reorganization. However, after the two battles of Zhuliao and Caoxian Dintao, the bandits suffered annihilating blows, resulting in a part of the remnant bandits having to cross the river first. The attempt to use this to reorganize and restore their strength has been severely挫敗. In eastern Shandong, Chen Yi originally had only four columns, but recently it has been reported that five local regiments have been formed into a new column, but their combat power is negligible. In central Shandong, the bandit's central Shandong headquarters has been moved to Lucun (southeast of Laiwu) in the Yimeng山区 area, and 10,000 new soldiers are being trained in Puli, southwest of Lucun, and 5,000 new soldiers are being trained in Zhuzhuang, southeast of Lucun. The National Army has prepared a plan for suppression, and it will not be difficult to subdue them.</p>

<h3>The Construction Problem of Provincial Enterprises</h3>
<p>— An Ren</p>
<p>(I)</p>
<p>Post-war economic construction involves countless tasks. Broadly speaking, it is nothing more than state-owned and private enterprises. State-owned enterprises include local enterprises, and local enterprises are provincial enterprises. Provincial enterprises and state-owned enterprises complement each other and are mutually utilized. Only then can various national industries be developed in an orderly manner. Recently, since Mr. Song Ziwen took charge of provincial administration in Guangdong, he has attached great importance to promoting economic construction. As a result, provincial enterprises have gradually become a dynamic business. I would like to take this opportunity to discuss the future of provincial enterprises.</p>
<p>State-owned and provincial enterprises have their basic conditions. If these basic conditions are lost, the effectiveness of state-owned and provincial enterprises will also gradually disappear. The basic conditions for state-owned and provincial enterprises: (1) It must take the most advantageous route. (2) It must be what the state and locality need most. (3) It must be what individuals and a small number of people cannot manage and can take sole responsibility for. (4) It must choose the most suitable location in the locality, and the supply and export of raw materials have the prospect of development. With these basic conditions, both state-owned and provincial enterprises can be expected to exert the greatest effect. However, there are various ancillary conditions that both state-owned and provincial enterprises must pay attention to: (1) The profits of this kind of state-owned and provincial enterprise must all be turned over to the public without any omissions. (2) The person in charge of this kind of state-owned and provincial enterprise and all its staff members must be honest and law-abiding and absolutely not corrupt. (3) The person in charge of this kind of state-owned and provincial enterprise and its staff members must be experienced and technically proficient talents in this kind of enterprise and absolutely not place private individuals to benefit themselves at public expense. (4) After the profits of this kind of state-owned and provincial enterprise are turned over to the state treasury and provincial treasury, it is guaranteed that the capital can be increased again to create new state-owned and provincial enterprises and absolutely not be diverted to other non-productive enterprises. (5) A portion of the net profits of this kind of state-owned and provincial enterprise is used to increase the various happiness and benefits of the people and is designated for use, so that it will not be converted into bureaucratic capital and harm the future development of state-owned and provincial enterprises. (6) Although this kind of state-owned enterprise is not solely for profit, the profits it obtains increase the benefits to consumers. (7) This kind of state-owned and provincial enterprise must be strictly managed by officials, with economical expenditures, avoiding bureaucratic style and habits, and professional personnel who are not changed easily. The above seven points are all ancillary conditions that state-owned and provincial enterprises should pay extreme attention to. If these seven ancillary conditions can be truly achieved, then we can wish for the future of our country's public enterprises. If public enterprises run counter to these seven ancillary conditions, then their future will soon fall into failure.</p>
<p>(II)</p>
<p>How to divide provincial enterprises and private enterprises is a problem that is currently not easy to solve. (1) From the perspective of regulating capital: If private enterprises develop to the extreme and the state adopts a laissez-faire policy, allowing private enterprises to develop freely, then it will fall into the path of capitalism and cannot be changed. Therefore, provincial enterprises should focus on regulating capital, exerting the power of local capital and expanding it for large-scale industries, so as not to excessively expand private enterprises and concentrate capital and wealth in one corner. (2) From the perspective of China's post-war economic construction: The eight-year war was harmed by Japanese aggression, and the people's capital and productivity suffered a great blow. The people who were腾　　的大　　为小　，小　　　赤贫. Eight out of ten people have fallen into the hunger line and hope that they can shoulder the responsibility of post-war economic construction, which is not easy to do at present. I believe that both state-owned and provincial enterprises should bear the heavy responsibility of post-war economic construction. After the public's vitality has recovered slightly, a small part of the public enterprises can be transferred to private management, and then the root and branch will not be misplaced. (3) From the perspective of supporting the people's enterprises: If all established and emerging industries are run by state-owned and provincial enterprises, although it is to develop national capital, it is not within the reach of the country's resources, and in the current situation of various outdated industries in the country, even if there are resources, it is impossible to do. In order to take care of the construction of various industries after the war, both national capital and people's capital must be expanded at the same time before they can work together. How to support the people's capital to make up for the shortcomings of public enterprises? I think that giving the people various conveniences for building industries and protecting their strength, on the one hand, absorbing overseas Chinese capital so that overseas Chinese capital can be concentrated on the development of various industries, and on the other hand, absorbing the people's idle capital so that it does not move towards speculation, hoarding, and non-productive paths, but towards the road of industrial construction. This depends on the government's good-will leadership. (4) From the perspective of the development of public (provincial) enterprises: Each locality should internally reorganize its existing industries so that they can strengthen their foundation and not be abandoned halfway. It should also allow a part of the shares of the promising new industries to be purchased by overseas Chinese shares and business shares, and use the collected capital to build new factories by provincial enterprises, one after another, so that economic construction can achieve the desired goal. This is a method of 推陳出新, and also a method of 暗渡陳倉. (5) From the perspective of cracking down on bureaucratic capital: The enterprises and companies operated by bureaucratic capital are neither public nor private, but a distorted phenomenon of economic development. These companies appear to be similar to state-owned or private enterprises, but they are neither fish nor fowl. In fact, bureaucratic capital uses the signboard of state-owned and public enterprises as a cover, and uses its political pressure to monopolize the commercial industries or distribute materials in trading ports. As for private commercial firms that want to import light and heavy industrial equipment and materials with legal procedures, their import licenses and requests for foreign exchange settlement are often shelved. This is what those who want to develop national capital and local capital to build people's livelihood industries should not ignore.</p>
<p>(III)</p>
<p>From the perspective of the Measures for the Reorganization of Provincial Enterprises promulgated by the Executive Yuan: The Measures for the Reorganization of Provincial Enterprises of each province promulgated by the Executive Yuan on October 30th last year (1947), as far as I can see, do not currently support the provincial government in operating various enterprises and selling them to private management immediately, but must take the fourth point method mentioned above. Because the general situation of the economic chaos after the war has a great impact on the people, even those with right resources may not be willing to inherit all of a certain type of enterprise, and even if they inherit it, how is the management and distribution plan, how is the experience and technology of the staff, and may not be able to cope with the current effective enterprise and continue to develop it. For example, allowing the people to purchase part of its stocks, and the government and the people jointly operate it, and achieve common steps. If we cooperate and work together, the development can be拭目以待. Now I will talk about the construction problem of Guangdong provincial enterprises. Most of Guangdong's provincial enterprises tend to be heavy industry. Guangdong is located in a remote coastal area, and its transportation with the world is earlier, and its emerging industry is basically higher than other provinces, but in fact it is not, compared with Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces,瞠平其后. According to estimates, there are more than 2,000 private factories in the province, most of which are small handicraft factories with immature technology and simple equipment, and are not considered large-scale industries. In recent years, due to the impact of the economic downturn, half of them have closed down, and the survivors are also in difficulty. As for the province's Guan营 factories, there were originally 28, and there were also 9 small Ying工厂, but all of them lacked machinery and raw materials. Each of the former three has stopped production and sold them, and only two of the latter can barely support them. In Guangzhou in October last year, there were more than 300 textile factories, now there are only more than 200; at the beginning of the resumption of cigarette factories, there were 192, now there are only 6; in February last year, there were more than 30 larger rubber factories, and about 200 household handicraft factories, now there are only about 20 of the former. It can be seen that the province's industry was revived for a while after the recovery, but then gradually declined. Based on the above statistics, it can be seen that the current situation of Guangdong's industry is that it should develop provincial enterprises and build various industries, and use the government's power to supplement and encourage the size of private industries.</p>
<p>(IV)</p>
<p>Afterwards, Guangdong's public enterprises that have now resumed work include the cement plant under the jurisdiction of the Construction Office. There are six companies under the jurisdiction of Guangdong Industrial Company: Shunde Sugar Factory, Textile Factory, Beverage Factory, Ice Making Factory, Brewery, and Machinery Factory. In addition, there are three companies in preparation: the Chemical Industry Factory, Silk Weaving Factory, and Industrial Experiment Factory of the Construction Department; several factories are being reorganized and planned, including the Guangzhou Paper Factory, Meilu Ramie Weaving Factory, Transportation Equipment Factory, Printing Factory, and Maoming Sugar Factory of Guangdong Industrial Company. The lack of Guangdong's emerging provincial industries is so great. In future construction, the existing factories should be reorganized and planned: What is the situation of its production and sales? How is the allocation of its raw materials? How is its labor technology? How is its management method? How is its promotion scope? How is its machinery power? All should be taken into account one by one, and then people can be used to their talents, land can be used to its advantages, things can be used to their full extent, and goods can be circulated smoothly.</p>
<p>(V)</p>
<p>After the First World War, the Soviet Union entered a new construction period in 1928. The Five-Year Plan was not a figment of the Soviet Union's imagination, but was decided by the Soviet authorities based on the situation of the national economy at that time and after the consideration of thousands of experts. During the revival period, the Soviet Union's power generation and machinery power manufacturing had been fully developed, and there were so-called guiding industrial sectors. The development of this industrial sector, in the view of the Soviet authorities, had a decisive significance for industrialization. How is the development of China's construction and Guangdong's construction after the war? In the future revival period, the guidance of the industrial sector has its own decisive significance. Now, focusing on the industrial construction of Guangdong: I believe that the ice making factory and beverage factory should be sold to private management in their entirety (if the people have the ability to bear it), and their funds should be transferred to equipment (1) Guangdong Food Production and Sales Management Company, or Food Production and Sales Administration. It is necessary to give priority to purchasing and storing food from all parts of the province and food imported from overseas, and then sell it to food stores and food merchants in various places, stipulating prices and reselling it for them. After there are many materials in the food production and sales company operated in the province, then we can talk about food control, food management, food distribution, and food can be grasped and tend to be stable, and then the prices of various commodities can not rise with the rise of gold and foreign exchange. (1) Expand the machinery manufacturing plant. The industrial company originally had a machinery factory, which has been transferred to the textile factory management, in order to 大　　　　　大量 agricultural implements. This factory can be expanded separately to become a machinery manufacturing factory. The main purpose of the Soviet Union's industrial construction was to turn an industrially backward agricultural country into a modern industrialized country. In the four years after 1932, the Soviet Union's machinery manufacturing had increased four times, such as aircraft manufacturing, aircraft engine manufacturing, chemical machinery manufacturing, automobile manufacturing, steel equipment manufacturing, metallurgical machinery manufacturing, mining machine manufacturing, textile machinery manufacturing, printing machine manufacturing, instrument manufacturing, and radio manufacturing. China's construction after the war should take Guangdong in South China as the main base. Only by paying attention to the expansion of this kind of machinery factory can we enter a brand-new period. (3) Establishment of a transportation equipment factory. In the first Five-Year Plan, the Soviet Union prepared to build about 60,000 kilometers of national roads, and the reconstruction of old roads was planned to be one million kilometers. However, the problem caused by the highway is the increased need for automobiles. Before the revolution, the Soviet Union did not have an automobile factory, and all automobiles were imported from foreign countries. Therefore, the Moscow factory and the Yaroslaf automobile factory were specially built, and a further step was taken to build an automobile factory. All the equipment was handled by the American Ford Motor Company, and it could produce 100,000 automobiles annually. The construction of our country's current transportation agencies is not talked about for a while, and the construction of transportation agency equipment can be manufactured by various provinces. If the financial resources are insufficient for a while, you can entrust the American company to invest in setting up factories in the transportation districts of various provinces to manufacture. This is the idea of Sun Yat-sen to absorb foreign capital in the industrial plan. (4) Establishment of a food canning factory. Guangdong is famous for producing fruits. The fruits produced annually are no less than dozens of kinds. Because the canning industry is underdeveloped, the fruits produced cannot be preserved for a long time due to time constraints, and today the goods are discarded on the ground, and many good fruits cannot be stored in cans and transported abroad, which is a pity. This is what I hope the Guangdong Industrial Company will establish recently to complete it. (5) Establishment of a fertilizer factory. Guangdong produces less than tens of millions of stones of food every year. This is due to the fact that many wasteland has not been developed and cannot be produced as much as possible, and it is also due to the insufficient supply of fertilizers to general farmers. Even if there is an import of foreign fertilizers, the value is very expensive, and general poor farmers cannot purchase them. I believe that the Guangdong Industrial Company should quickly design and establish this factory; for Guangdong丰业　　　　　　, should not think　　　　　　　either.</p>
<p>(VI)</p>
<p>The above is just about Guangdong Province. In fact, our country is an industrially backward country, so that all provinces can work hard on the construction of emerging industries in the future, and after five years, it is not difficult to move towards the road of revival by proceeding according to the prescribed planned steps. In the past ten years, the Soviet Union has progressed from an agricultural country to an industrial country, and its journey has many things that we can imitate. The Soviet Union's New Economic Policy is the same as Sun Yat-sen's economic policy. The Soviet Union has revived the country with three five-year plans and has tracked the advanced countries, and China's post-war construction is confident that it can also strive forward and keep pace with them. According to the Guangdong Five-Year Construction Plan, the premise is to seek sufficient supply of steel, and the five-year industrial construction is headed by the steel industry, and the iron ores of Qiongya, Yunfu, Lechang, Ruyuan, Yangshan, Zijin, and Xinyi are used to establish a foundation for ironmaking. With the production of steel, the use of various mother machines and sub-machines can naturally inherit and develop from the machinery industry. However, this creation is not easy, and I deeply hope that Chairman Song, who is in charge of provincial administration, and those who are responsible for construction, will gradually cultivate it, which is the humble intention of the writer.</p>
<h3>Zhenjiang Rice Prices Turn Stable</h3>
<p>[Our Zhenjiang Dispatch, 22nd] Zhenjiang rice prices are slightly stable today because the weather has cleared. The opening price of top-quality rice is 2.1 million, but oil prices remain high due to high prices in the production area. Soybean oil is now sold for 5.5 million per 100 jin. According to a rice merchant in Hexia, the rice prices in Zhenjiang and Wuxi rose after the Spring Festival. A large number of grain boats from the Anhui province production area originally planned to sell directly in Zhenjiang, Wuxi, and Shanghai. However, because Nanling and other counties in Anhui province require a tax of 12 jin per stone of rice leaving the country to subsidize the county security expenses, the grain merchants dare not rashly sell because of the heavy burden. It is also known that there are more than 100 grain boats currently滞留 in Nanling and other places.</p>
<h3>The Real Culprit in the Murder of Xu Shoushang Was Arrested</h3>
<p>Stabbed to death after being discovered stealing</p>

The Taiwan Provincial Police Department announced at 10:00 PM today: The murderer in this case is Gao Wanche, a 22-year-old resident of Taipei City. He was a laborer hired by Xu when he was the director of the Taiwan Provincial Translation and Compilation Office. According to Gao's confession: On the night of the 18th, when he sneaked into Xu's house to steal, he was discovered by Mr. Xu, so he acted cruelly. The lost clothing box from Xu's house and the bloody clothes worn by the murderer have also been recovered. The murderer also confessed to the stabbing. Reporters asked Xu Shiying, Xu Shishen, and Tang Zhaoheng, three members of Mr. Xu's family, for their opinions on the case. They replied: "This is a case of谋财害命. We will wait for the court to resolve it." Xu Shijuan also said: "My father was a scholar who was kind to people throughout his life. Now he has lost his life like this, which makes me feel sad about the world." Gao Wanche will be punished according to law. Other suspects arrested in this case have been released.</p>

<h3>The Capital Commission Focuses on Coal, Steel, and Electrical Industries This Year</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 22nd] It has been learned that the Capital Commission's work focus and business plan for this year will pay special attention to the following points: (1) Coal industry: A. Concentrate efforts on the development of various mines in Hunan and Laixi, followed by Zibo Coal Mine. In the Zibo area, special attention should be paid to Boshan. B. In order to increase production and solve the coal shortage, it is feasible in principle to rent some coalfields in the Zibo mining area to private management, but the lease term should not exceed two years, and strict quotas must be established to urge production. Efforts should also be made to purchase coal produced by local kilns in western Jiangxi. C. Make efforts to develop the Nanling Coal Mine and complete the Gouguan Highway as soon as possible. (2) Steel industry: Special emphasis will be placed on the Tianjin Steel Rolling Plant. (3) Electrical industry: Greatly increase the production of radio receivers and wireless electrical materials to achieve economic self-sufficiency.</p>
<h3>Telecommunications Lines and Railways Severely Damaged by Communist Bandits</h3>

<h3>Bandit Bohai Military Sub-district Commander Zhao Jizhou Ousted Due to Infighting</h3>
<p>[Our Xuzhou Dispatch on the 22nd] Internal strife among the bandits in North China is intensifying. High-ranking officials and factions are ousting each other. For example, Zhao Jizhou, commander of the Third Military Sub-district of the Bandit Bohai Military Region, was recently dismissed and investigated by the Bandit East China Military Region Headquarters. The Bohai District Party Committee also decided to: (1) dismiss Zhao Jizhou from his position as commander of the Third Military Sub-district and immediately detain him; (2) remove Zhao Jizhou from his position on the District Committee and expel him from the Chinese Communist Party; (3) escort him to Shenjiaying Village and hand him over to the masses for public trial.

<h3>After Hebei Teachers' College Merged with Ping Normal University, Students Opposing the Entrance Exam Beat Students Who Support It</h3>
<p>Attack Carried out Behind Closed Doors, Five People Injured</p>
<p>[Our Beiping Dispatch on the 22nd] Students from Hebei Provincial Teachers' College engaged in a major brawl in Beiping over the issue of merging with National Beiping Normal University. After the Ministry of Education ordered the merger, the Teachers' College students came to Beiping and resided at 22 Chengfang Street, awaiting participation in the Normal University's placement exam. However, due to repeated refusals by some students to participate in the exam, a stalemate ensued. Yin Zuying, the dean of general affairs of the Normal University, upon assuming the post of Commissioner of Education of Hebei Province, formulated three measures in conjunction with the Normal University to give the Teachers' College students another opportunity: (1) all Teachers' College students must participate in the placement exam; (2) students who do not participate in the exam will be dismissed; (3) students who participate in the exam but are not admitted will be placed by the Department of Education. These measures were conveyed to the students by Jin Zhuofeng, the principal of the Teachers' College. On the 20th, over eighty Teachers' College students visited Yin, demanding a guarantee of admission to the Normal University. Yin refused. The petitioning students returned without achieving their goal. That night, some students who opposed participating in the entrance exam drove the students who supported participation to the central courtyard, tightly closed the gates, and beat them. Fortunately, no weapons were used. Security authorities arrived after hearing the news, preventing a major incident. Only five people were injured. Currently, Commissioner Yin, for safety, has moved those who support participation in the entrance exam to the Normal University, while those who oppose it remain at the original location. However, they may still participate in the entrance exam if they wish. The Normal University's placement exam is scheduled for the 24th and 25th.</p>
<h3>Qingdao Mayor Requests Opening of Loans</h3>
<p>(Continued from Page 1) His visit is specifically to request the central government to find a solution. Regarding the food issue, it is proposed to request the central government to allocate 300,000 bags of flour, 60,000 bags of rice, and 60,000 bags of coarse grains to alleviate the current urgent needs. Li arrived in Nanjing on the 21st and immediately visited Food Commissioner Yu Feipeng that evening. In principle, Yu agreed to assist, but the specific methods are still under discussion. Regarding the coal issue, Qingdao requires approximately 30,000 tons of coal each month. Currently, the central government only ships over 15,000 tons of coal to Qingdao each month, while the power plant alone requires over 12,000 tons of coal, which is insufficient. It is proposed to request the central government to supply 30,000 tons each month. The issues of refugees and opening up loans will also be discussed with relevant agencies to find solutions. Li is scheduled to visit President Zhang Qun on the 23rd to report on the food and coal difficulties in Qingdao and the issues awaiting resolution. On the morning of the 22nd, Li visited Zhang Jia'ao to request the opening of loans to save Qingdao's industrial and commercial crisis. Zhang replied that the opening of loans is a comprehensive issue. If loans are opened, Qingdao will also be handled according to the general situation. However, currently, apart from the method of purchasing finished products, loans have not been restored.</p>

<h3>Cooperative Enterprises Association Opens Fifth Annual Meeting</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 22nd] The 22nd marked the eighth anniversary of the establishment of the China Cooperative Enterprises Association. The association held the opening ceremony of its fifth annual meeting at the Jieshou Hall. Attendees included Chen Guofu, Shao Lizi, Li Zonghuang, Hong Lanyou, Zhao Baoquan, Xie Zhengfu, Tang Qiyu, as well as representatives from the Ministries of Economic Affairs, Agriculture and Forestry, and Finance, and Liu Siying, Ye Qianji, Zhou Zhenhua, and Zhang Jingrui from the Four Joint Offices, totaling over 300 people. Representatives from the Taiwan branch associations, Gao Liangzuo, Huang Nanyang, and Su Haishui, traveled from afar to participate for the first time, which is truly commendable. The conference began at 9:00 AM with ceremonial proceedings. Chairman Shou Miancheng, the director-general, reported that future work should strengthen the association's affairs, attract socially enthusiastic cooperative individuals as members, and strengthen publicity to transform resistance into assistance. Agricultural cooperation should be the focus of China's cooperative movement. The government is currently focusing on the production of food, cotton, and export goods, and cooperative organizations should closely coordinate with them. The Constitution has clearly stipulated that cooperative enterprises should receive national encouragement and assistance, which is the focus of discussion. It is hoped that everyone will express their opinions for the government to adopt and implement. Committee Member Chen Guofu, Secretary-General Shao Lizi, Secretary-General Li Zonghuang, and others delivered speeches successively, followed by the singing of the Cooperative Song and a group photo. Lunch was held at noon, and the meeting continued at 2:00 PM in the afternoon to amend the association's charter, pass the amended outline of the China Cooperative Movement, and over twenty other proposals. A general outline of the principles of how the state should encourage and assist cooperative enterprises during the constitutional period was passed and handed over to the association's board of directors to continue researching detailed plans.</p>
<h3>Main Culprit in Changchun Gold Case Fined 50 Million Circulation Certificates</h3>
<p>Used for Refugee and Infant Relief</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Changchun, 22nd] The Changchun gold case that caused a sensation in the city has recently been decided by the joint meeting of Changchun city party, government, and military cadres, with a fine imposed as punishment. The two main culprits, "Little Gold Tigers" He Qingyu and Qu Huichen, were fined a total of 50 million circulation certificates, which have already been allocated to the Refugee Relief Committee and three infant reception groups as operating expenses.</p>
<h3>Chen Zhiping Visits Philippine President to Discuss Thorny Issues</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Manila, 22nd] A reporter learned today from reliable sources that our envoy to the Philippines, Chen Zhiping, will visit the Philippine President on the morning of the 23rd to discuss the thorny market stall case, and may also discuss other issues that hinder Sino-Philippine relations.</p>
<h3>Amidst Talk of Government Staff Reductions, First Cut Dry-Salary Personnel</h3>
<p>"Hunan Daily" Writes Article Advocating It</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 22nd] According to news from Changsha, amidst the nationwide implementation of government staff reductions, the "Hunan Daily" in Changsha recently published an article advocating that "the province's staff reductions should start with the councilors receiving dry salaries." According to the newspaper, these councilors are mostly concurrently serving as provincial councilors and openly receiving dry salaries, which is extremely illegal and has long been ridiculed by the public. However, "let them laugh and scold as they please, I will still receive my dry salary." In the dictionary of provincial councilors receiving dry salaries, there are no words for "integrity" or "shame." During the last provincial council meeting, some people, driven by conscience, proposed "not receiving councilor's dry salaries," but ultimately, due to the belief that "personal integrity is a small matter, legal tender is a big matter," no conclusion was reached. This is a stain on the history of Hunan's civil governance.</p>
<h3>Haihe Engineering Bureau Formulates New Ge Village Cut-off Plan</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tianjin, 22nd] The Haihe Engineering Bureau, in order to improve the Haihe waterway, has recently formulated a Ge Village Cut-off Plan and will request special funds from the Executive Yuan for construction. Regarding the Ge Village Cut-off, during the enemy-puppet period, the Japanese had started construction based on our country's pre-war plan. The new river channel had been excavated for 1,808 meters, but was later interrupted. In the original plan, the new river channel was to be 8,400 meters long, which was too large a project and lacked funding. The Haihe Engineering Bureau's new plan has shortened the river channel project to 4,880 meters. After excavating 3,072 meters in addition to what the Japanese had already done, it can be completed.

<h3>US Reaction to Aid China Plan</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 21st] Regarding the government's proposed $570 million aid to China plan, an initial trend is quite evident in the first few days of discussion in public and private sectors, newspapers, and Congress: the plan clearly displeases all sides.</p>
<p>Those who previously enthusiastically supported aid to President Chiang's government now deem the plan "extremely inappropriate."</p>
<p>Some argue that the plan lacks military assistance, while others say that it does not stipulate any efforts to stabilize China's currency system. Still others believe that both should be addressed.</p>
<p>On the other hand, those who previously vehemently opposed aid to the central government believe that the proposed plan is simply a waste of money. They believe that since it will have no practical effect in China, it would be better to use it elsewhere or save it.</p>
<p>Observers believe that those who have no strong opinions on the issue of aid to China are now confused by the debates on all sides and do not know what to do.</p>
<p>President Truman and Secretary of State Marshall's statements regarding the plan are seen here as indicating that the plan was proposed at the request of the Republican Party, not because the government genuinely believes that proposing the plan at this time is of any benefit.</p>
<p>Marshall bluntly told the House Foreign Affairs Committee that if Congress cannot discuss the aid to Europe plan and the aid to China plan simultaneously, then it can pass the aid to Europe bill first, leaving out the China portion. This statement gave everyone the above impression.</p>
<p>Although Marshall admitted that without American aid, the Chinese government might collapse, allowing the communists to control all of China north of the Yangtze River, thereby weakening America's position in Korea and Japan, he still made this argument.</p>
<p>This statement also failed to dispel confusion about the government's true intentions.</p>
<p>On the other hand, those who oppose providing large sums of money to aid China have proposed various different suggestions. Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Eaton requested that the United States enter China with a substantially large aid plan to control the entire situation.</p>
<p>Chow Yide and the Washington Post, whose opinions on China issues are often consistent, now both agree that silver coins should be used to recall the current highly inflationary paper currency.</p>
<p>Conservative Evening Star columnist Blanc did not discuss the possibility of stabilizing the currency value, but requested military aid to China so that it could defeat the communists.</p>
<p>Post Comments on Marshall's Testimony</p>
<p>Yalta Conference Was a Grave Mistake</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 21st] Regarding Marshall's statement to the House Foreign Affairs Committee yesterday that he was not aware in advance of the concessions made to the Soviet Union on the Northeast issue at the Yalta Conference, the Washington Post recently criticized the Yalta Conference as a "grave mistake."</p>
<p>It stated that the late President Roosevelt paid a considerable price to induce the Soviet Union to join the Pacific War, and that "under the current circumstances where the Soviet Union and China do not cooperate, this price weighs heavily on the conscience of the American people. The Soviet Union, through the Yalta Agreement, sought to make the Northeast a Soviet colony, disregarding China's rights. The Soviet Union, in President Chiang's current predicament, has only expressed its friendship and support for President Chiang through silence and inaction." The newspaper quoted an unnamed authoritative source as saying that Marshall told the late President Roosevelt at Yalta that Japan could surrender within six months after the collapse of Germany, and stated: "There are few mistakes in this war greater than Yalta."</p>
<p>Star Asks Marshall to</p>
<p>Clarify Stance on Nationalists and Communists</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 21st] A Washington Star editorial asked US Secretary of State Marshall to clarify the US stance on the relationship between the Chinese Nationalists and Communists. The newspaper stated that President Wu's message to Congress regarding aid to China has failed to quell the controversy in the United States over China policy. Since coalition governments of communists and other parties have proven impossible in countries around the world, has the State Department recognized this fact and changed its view? The newspaper concluded: "Since an agreement between the Chinese Nationalists and Communists is clearly impossible, what is the alternative?" These questions should be clearly explained so that Congress and the public can have guidelines.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, San Francisco, 21st, United Press] The San Francisco Chronicle today published an article titled "China and the 1948 Presidential Election," stating that the Republican Party is using the China issue as an attack point against the government's foreign policy, and the President is also using political advantages, but "both seem not to have thoroughly examined the China issue, which is truly unsatisfactory." The American people, who are more concerned with world peace than with who will be in the White House in the next four years, should demand better performance from the responsible leaders of both parties.</p>

<h3>Rapid Developments in the Czech Political Situation: Washington and London Closely Monitoring; the Only Democratic Nation in Eastern Europe Faces Calamity</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 21st] State Department officials dismissed with a laugh the Moscow radio report that US Ambassador to Czechoslovakia, Steinhardt, instructed non-communist members of the Czech cabinet to resign. US officials stated that the US government is closely monitoring the Czech political situation, with the US Embassy providing reports to the State Department at all times. Officials here are extremely concerned about recent developments in Prague. The announcement by Premier Gottwald of a foiled coup plot, his ousting of non-communist cabinet members, and the arrival of a Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister in Prague, indicate that Czechoslovakia, the only country in Eastern Europe not yet under full communist control, will inevitably face the same fate as other small Eastern European nations. The maintenance of Czech political integrity and independence is considered more important here than that of other Eastern European countries. The reasons are as follows: Firstly, the United States and Czechoslovakia have a traditionally close relationship. The foundation of the Czechoslovak Republic was laid during World War I with the assistance of then-US President Wilson, by the first Czech President Masaryk (father of the current Czech Foreign Minister) and the current Czech President Beneš, who were based in the United States. Therefore, a successful communist coup in Czechoslovakia would likely evoke a sharper reaction in the US than developments in other Eastern European countries. Secondly, Czechoslovakia has always been seen as a bridge between Eastern and Western Europe, especially regarding the Marshall Plan. Although Czechoslovakia was forced by Soviet intervention to withdraw from the Marshall Plan, it is hoped here that trade between Czechoslovakia and countries participating in the plan can play an important role in supplementing the effects of the aid plan. Finally, it is believed here that the relationship between the Soviet Union and Czechoslovakia, at least in theory, can be a test of the Soviet claim that "the goal of its foreign policy is solely to ensure that neighboring countries are friendly to the Soviet Union for security reasons." In fact, Czechoslovakia has consistently supported the Soviet government's views in international conferences, and its political and economic ties with the Soviet Union are sufficient to demonstrate its friendship. Therefore, recent developments in Czechoslovakia may reveal the true goals of the Soviet Union's proclaimed foreign policy.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, London, 21st] Developments in the Czech political situation are causing considerable concern here. Observers say that the Czech government is the last bastion of Western European democratic and liberal ideals. The communists want to destroy it to establish a political system similar to those in Eastern European countries, in accordance with Soviet demands. This offensive has been brewing for some time but had not yet reached fruition. The sudden outbreak is due to Moscow's great alarm at the strengthening of Western European unity, believing that the opportunity must not be lost to prevent Western European countries from negotiating on the German question. Non-communist cabinet members will still launch a major counterattack, but it is widely believed that communist Premier Gottwald will propose a reorganization of the government with the communists and left-wing social democrats as the main players. The communist strategy in Czechoslovakia is to win the sympathy of the Social Democrats, which should not be difficult, as the communist efforts in the past two months have already won the support of the working class.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, London, 21st] The Foreign Office has just received a report from the British Embassy in Czechoslovakia regarding the Czech coup. The Foreign Office has also received copies of the resolution on the German question issued after the meeting of the Foreign Ministers of Poland, Romania, and Czechoslovakia in Prague, as well as the Soviet-Hungarian treaty. All three documents have been forwarded to Foreign Secretary Bevin for further study.</p>
<h3>Czech President Tries to Avert Cabinet Crisis: Urges All Parties to Work Together and Continue Cooperation; Communist Party's Attitude is Firm and Determined to Fulfill Demands</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Prague, 21st] Czech workers held a mass rally in the square outside Prague's Old City Hall. After listening to a speech by communist Premier Gottwald, they passed a resolution demanding that President Beneš accept the resignation of the twelve non-communist cabinet members and form a "Gottwald government without reactionary cabinet members." The rally then dispatched a delegation to meet with President Beneš, who assured them that the new government formed after this political crisis would still be led by Gottwald. He also stated that the new government would be a government under a parliamentary system, and not a non-partisan transitional government. No party, whether communist or any other party in parliament, would be excluded. Beneš also called on all parties to work together and cooperate during this difficult time.</p>
<p>After giving a speech at the mass rally, (the content of which was reported yesterday) Premier Gottwald, accompanied by Interior Minister Nosek, met with Beneš. Beneš later met with three leaders of the Social Democratic Party: Deputy Premier Fierlinger, Party Chairman Lausman, and Secretary-General Vilím. Beneš then left Prague for his Lana villa, 55 kilometers northwest, for the weekend. There is no hope of resolving the cabinet crisis before his return. The Communist Party has convened a meeting of 8,000 representatives of the National Trade Union Council to be held here on Sunday for further demonstrations.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Prague, 22nd] Trade unions and communists belonging to the Czech Communist Party convened a congress of representatives of the Trade Union Council in the Czech capital today, deciding to hold a one-hour strike next Tuesday to warn the government and implement their demands.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Prague, 21st] All bridges of compromise between President Beneš and the Communist Party now seem to be completely broken. Communist leader Gottwald, while convening what he called "the greatest parliament of Czechoslovakia," a national meeting of labor council representatives, delivered a fierce and threatening speech, demanding the immediate formation of a new government, excluding all right-wing and centrist parties. The uncompromising attitude of the communist leader has rendered all attempts at mediation and understanding ineffective. Although Gottwald did not explicitly mention the president's name in his speech, his words were clearly addressed to Beneš.</p>
<h3>Czech Communists Demand Formation of an All-Communist Cabinet</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Prague, 21st] The Czech Communist Party, led by Premier Gottwald, today demanded that President Beneš accept the resignations of the twelve non-communist cabinet members in the coalition cabinet. In the name of the Presidium of the Czech Communist Party, signed by Chairman Gottwald and Secretary-General Slánský, a letter was submitted to President Beneš, stating that according to public opinion, constitutional provisions, and democratic practice, the President should immediately initiate negotiations to fill the vacancies caused by the resignations. The letter also expressed the belief that the Social Democrats would certainly continue to participate in the government with the Communist Party. The letter further requested that President Beneš accept public opinion and agree to the Communist Party's demands to promote a happier development of the Czechoslovak People's Republic. In another letter to the Executive Committee of the Social Democratic Party, the Communist leaders argued that the current crisis could be resolved jointly by the Communist Party and the Social Democratic Party, and that both parties have a responsibility to ensure the peaceful development of the Republic and promote socialist development. The letter also pointed out that accepting the resignations of the non-communist cabinet members is the only way to resolve the crisis.</p>
<h3>London Conference Opens Today: France May Participate in the Full Merger of West German Zones; US Resolutely Rejects Soviet Protest</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Paris, 21st] French Prime Minister's Office Secretary-General, Minister of State Apel, revealed to reporters after today's cabinet meeting that France may participate in the merger of the three occupied zones of Germany if it receives satisfactory conditions. The cabinet meeting's communique stated that the cabinet has approved the instructions drafted by Foreign Minister Bidault for the French delegation to the London Big Three Conference. Apel also said that the French delegation would pay particular attention to the discussions on the international control of the Ruhr and the German political structure. France favors the establishment of a federal state in Germany, but is not completely opposed to the reunification of Germany.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 22nd] In a note delivered to the Soviet Ambassador to the United States on the 21st, US Deputy Secretary of State Lovett emphasized that the Soviet government's actions have made it necessary for the US, Britain, and France to convene a conference in London on the German question. Lovett stated that since the Soviet government has failed to comply with the provisions of the Potsdam Agreement to establish a unified German economic organization, the other three powers must consult on the reorganization of the German economy for the benefit of the German and European people. Lovett claimed that the Soviet protest could only be interpreted as the Soviet government shirking its responsibility for Germany's current division. Lovett concluded that the United States still hopes that the Soviet Union will participate in the Four Power Conference to find a way to unify Germany.</p>
<h3>Japanese Newspapers Mostly Criticize Ashida After His Election as New Prime Minister: Accuse Him of Engaging in "Black Market Deals" with the Socialist Party</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 22nd] According to commentaries and news reports carried in major Tokyo newspapers today, Ashida is beginning his duties as Prime Minister amidst widespread criticism from the press and labor circles. The editorial of the "Yomiuri Shimbun" launched a particularly fierce attack, entitled "The Most Hideous Thing Under Heaven," criticizing Ashida for engaging in "black market deals" with left-wing members of the Social Democratic Party to seek their support for his nomination as Prime Minister. The article stated: The failure of the Katayama cabinet was due to the opposition of left-wing members to the Democratic Party's policies. Now, they have turned around and supported Ashida, which indicates their lack of responsibility and political integrity. Conversely, Ashida has also made successive concessions to the left-wing members whom he had denounced bitterly two weeks ago. The article strongly criticized the Ashida cabinet and expressed absolute opposition. Although the "Asahi Shimbun" was not as harsh as the "Yomiuri," it also expressed regret that power was not transferred to the opposition party, which it deemed a violation of the constitution. The newspaper stated that the establishment of the Ashida cabinet was based solely on policy agreements between the government parties. The "Mainichi Shimbun" published an article advising Ashida to strictly adhere to these policies, stating that his nomination did not receive the support and understanding of the Japanese people. The "Jiji Shinpo" and "Nihon Keizai Shimbun" also criticized the Democratic Party for violating the constitution and compromising with socialist policies. In addition to these criticisms unfavorable to Ashida, it was also believed that since Ashida was a member of the previous Katayama cabinet, he could continue Katayama's work, preventing a sudden interruption of government work as would have occurred if the Liberal Party had succeeded in nominating a prime minister. At a time when the national economic situation is precarious, maintaining the continuity of the government in general can avoid other chaotic situations.</p>
<p>[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 22nd] After the failure of the Liberal Party in the prime ministerial nomination election, it immediately convened successive meetings of its members to discuss how to deal with the Ashida cabinet as an opposition party in the Diet in the future. At the same time, it also decided to continue the movement for a new conservative party, regardless of MacArthur's opposition. General political observers believe that although Ashida has obtained the position of Prime Minister, his cabinet formation process still faces considerable difficulties. Yoshida, who failed in this election, has about the same strength as Ashida in the House of Representatives, but surpasses Ashida in the House of Councillors. If Mr. Yoshida can revitalize the spirit of the opposition party, the Ashida cabinet will not only have to be cautious in its policies, but he will still have great prospects on the political stage in the future.</p>
<h3>Hashimoto Kingoro Once Created the Northeast Incident</h3>
<p>The International Tribunal Has Filed Charges</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 22nd] Hashimoto Kingoro has recently been charged with creating and inciting fascist-like incidents to expand Japan's invasion routes. According to reports, Hashimoto Kingoro strongly advocated the use of Japanese military force to expel Chinese people from the Northeast after Zhang Zuolin was assassinated. The evidence indicates that before the "Manchurian Incident," he strongly advocated taking "active action," and later he incited the incident.</p>
<h3>Security Council Prepares to Break the Deadlock Between the Netherlands and Indonesia</h3>
<p>Will Authorize the Mediation Committee to Resolve the Dispute</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Lake Success, 21st] The United Nations Security Council appears likely to authorize the Three-Nation Committee to continue mediating the Dutch-Indonesian dispute, with a view to reaching a final solution, despite Soviet opposition. The Soviet Union and Ukraine have both attacked colonial powers, claiming that these powers are now forcing the Indonesian Republic to accept unilateral mediation agreements in order to achieve their imperialist goals. But although the Soviet Union has attacked the Three-Nation Arbitration Committee composed of the US, Belgium, and Australia, it does not intend to use its veto power.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Lake Success, 21st] The Indonesian Republic has reiterated its request to strengthen the powers of the United Nations Arbitration Committee. The Indonesian representative told the Security Council that the Netherlands' activities since signing the Renville Agreement have still caused unrest. He also attacked the Netherlands for establishing new native states in East Java against the wishes of the local people. He then thanked the representatives of China and India for sympathizing with the Indonesian viewpoint as spokesmen for the two major Asian powers. He emphasized that China strongly supported the strengthening of the powers of the Three-Nation Arbitration Committee. He warned that if the committee's powers could not be strengthened, both sides might not comply with the agreement. The Colombian representative stated that he might suggest that the Security Council should take direct responsibility for the Indonesian dispute.</p>
<h3>Khuang Aphaiwong Nominated as New Siamese Prime Minister</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Bangkok, 21st] The Regency Council decided today to nominate Democrat Party leader Khuang Aphaiwong as the new Prime Minister. It is expected that the new cabinet can be formed in time for the meeting of both houses of parliament to begin discussing the vote of confidence on the 26th. Khuang Aphaiwong has served as Prime Minister three times since July 1944. The first time, he emerged to form a government after Phibun was ousted by parliament. In January 1946, he was again invited to serve as Prime Minister. After last November's coup, he served as Prime Minister for the third time.</p>

<h3>Taft Urges the United Nations to Implement the Partition of the Holy Land</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 21st] Republican Senator Taft delivered a speech today, urging the United Nations to implement the partition plan for Palestine. He said that otherwise, a civil war will occur in Palestine. He strongly argued that the United Nations organization has an obligation to establish some form of international control in the area after the British troops withdraw from Palestine. As for the United States, it should not merely express formal support for the United Nations resolution.</p>
<h3>Pakistan Withdraws from the Sterling Area</h3>
<p>[United Press, London, 21st] The British Treasury announced that Palestine will no longer be part of the sterling area from midnight on the 21st, and its remaining sterling balances will be temporarily frozen. This measure is in preparation for the abandonment of the mandate on May 15, but will ensure that the Holy Land has sufficient funds to operate before the mandate ends. The Palestinian pound is linked to sterling, and Transjordan also uses the Palestinian currency, so it will be temporarily excluded from the sterling area. However, Transjordan has notified the British government that it intends to enact legislation to rejoin the sterling area.</p>

<p>Turning Minor Matters into Major Matters and Major Matters into Minor Matters</p>
<p>Following the Pearl Harbor incident, our informal relations with General de Gaulle deteriorated due to the unreasonable action of the Free French forces, under his command, to forcibly occupy the French islands of Saint Pierre and Miquelon near the coast of Newfoundland. The incident occurred on Christmas night while the President was entertaining Prime Minister Churchill at the White House.</p>
<p>These islands were originally under the administration of Governor Robert of Martinique. We had reached an agreement with Governor Robert, and therefore we insisted on maintaining the status quo of Saint Pierre and Miquelon, and our insistence was guaranteed. This agreement was renewed several days after the Pearl Harbor incident. In November and December, we also held negotiations with Canada regarding a powerful radio station on Saint Pierre Island, because both Canada and we were deeply concerned that it could guide the activities of German submarines. We agreed that Canada should send telegraphers to monitor the messages sent by the radio station, and if the local governor refused to acknowledge this Canadian action, we would act in concert with Canada to apply economic pressure on the two islands.</p>
<p>On December 4, the Canadian government informed us of a suggestion from the British government that these two islands should be occupied by Free French forces. This suggestion was deemed undesirable by both Canada and ourselves.</p>
<p>At the end of November, De Gaulle sent his "Minister of the Navy," Muselier, to inspect the Free French light fleet operating with the British near the coast of Newfoundland and to try to involve Miquelon Island in his actions. Muselier went to Ottawa to seek the opinion of the Canadian government. The Canadian Department of Foreign Affairs did not grant permission.</p>
<p>On December 15, the British Foreign Office stated that Prime Minister Churchill believed it was better for Free French forces to land and control the radio station than for the Canadian government to take action, as the latter could create an embarrassing political situation. The Foreign Office also said that no further action would be taken without the prior permission of the United States and Canadian governments.</p>
<p>On the same day, Muselier went to see Moffat, our minister in Ottawa, to seek the opinion of the United States government on the issue of Free French forces landing on these islands. The President read Moffat's telegram and said that he did not approve of any policy that would allow the Free French to be involved in the Saint Pierre-Miquelon situation, and he informed Moffat by telephone.</p>
<p>Moffat informed Muselier of our views on December 16. Muselier told Moffat that he felt we were making a mistake, but he would accept the decision.</p>
<p>On December 22, Laun, the counselor of the Canadian Legation in Washington, said that he could inform us that any action by the Free French forces had been prevented.</p>
<p>However, at the same time, Muselier communicated with De Gaulle, who ordered him to proceed as planned.</p>
<p>Therefore, Admiral Muselier, without prior warning to Canada or the United States, landed a small number of troops on the two islands on Christmas night and took them over. Our consul in Saint Pierre, Paske, reported to us on December 26 that Muselier had expressed deep dissatisfaction with De Gaulle, saying that his actions were like those of a dictator. Muselier said he wanted to resign, protesting against De Gaulle's unilateral order to him without obtaining the approval of the United States and Canada. Some time later, Muselier indeed broke with De Gaulle.</p>
<p>On Christmas Day, with the President's approval, I issued a statement pointing out that the incident caused by three "so-called Free French ships" was "a unilateral action against the agreements made by the parties concerned, and the United States government was certainly not aware of or authorized it in any way beforehand."</p>
<p>Unfortunately, many influential people in the United States and abroad failed to understand the broader implications of the incident and launched fierce attacks on the State Department and me for the statement issued regarding the Free French occupation of the two islands. Rarely has such a minor action caused such intense opposition.</p>
<p>We were particularly attacked for the word "so-called" in the phrase "so-called Free French ships" in the statement. Those who attacked us believed that by using this word, we meant to express doubt about the existence of the Free French or to doubt that they were free. In fact, what we meant by the phrase was simply "three ships assumed to be Free French."</p>
<p>Using the issue of the occupation of these islands as a medium, I had a frank conversation with Prime Minister Churchill at the White House regarding our entire problem with Vichy France. The President fully agreed with my position. He was also present when I discussed the matter with Mr. Churchill, but he remained on the sidelines, allowing us to have a frank exchange.</p>
<p>I accused De Gaulle of being a troublemaker who hindered the work of others with meaningless actions, directly violating the will that Britain, Canada, and the United States had already expressed. I demanded that the Prime Minister persuade him to withdraw his troops from Saint Pierre and Miquelon and allow Canadians and Americans to be responsible for supervising the Saint Pierre radio station.</p>
<p>Mr. Churchill said that if he insisted on such a demand, his relationship with the Free French movement would be harmed.</p>
<p>I replied that if the Free French remained on these two islands and we did nothing, it would affect our relationship with the Vichy government. I reiterated the importance of continuing to maintain this relationship, as it allowed us to use our influence to prevent the French fleet and bases from falling into German hands and to maintain observers in Vichy France and French North and West Africa.</p>
<p>Mr. Churchill agreed that this relationship with Vichy was as important to Britain as it was to the United States.</p>
<p>I directly asked the Prime Minister if he could do anything to stop De Gaulle from continuing to attack the United States government in the radio stations and newspapers.</p>
<p>When Churchill doubted whether he could exercise such censorship over De Gaulle, I said that De Gaulle's opposition to our propaganda campaign was supported by British funds, and if Mr. Churchill could threaten to stop the subsidies, De Gaulle would soon be helpless.</p>
<p>Mr. Churchill agreed to consider the points I had raised.</p>
<p>Just as things were developing to this point, the Prime Minister went to Ottawa and delivered a speech on December 20, fiercely attacking Vichy and praising De Gaulle to the skies.</p>
<p>The day after Mr. Churchill delivered his speech, I sent the President a memorandum in which I said: "Our British friends seem to believe that all French people firmly support De Gaulle, but according to all the information I and my colleagues have obtained, about 95 percent of all French people are anti-Hitler, and of these 95 percent, more than 95 percent are not De Gaullists and will not follow him. This fact has a direct impact on our North African plans, and therefore we should not count on De Gaulle's cooperation."</p>
<p>Regarding this last point, the President had long decided that De Gaulle should not be included in any plans for an Anglo-American invasion of French North Africa, and he had tried his best to explain this decision to Mr. Churchill. He felt that including De Gaulle could affect the confidentiality of the plan and would automatically provoke resistance among the French in North Africa.</p>
<p>Churchill returned to Washington almost immediately after delivering his speech in Ottawa. On January 2, I saw him at the White House and unhesitatingly said that his remarks about Vichy and De Gaulle were "extremely irritating" and had caused profound damage to me and the State Department.</p>
<p>I pleaded with him, saying that since our relationship with Vichy was of great value to Britain, as it was to the United States, because he himself had repeatedly admitted this to us, if he could "say a few words" indicating that although Britain was unwilling to maintain relations with Vichy, the relationship maintained by the United States was valuable for the common purpose, it would be extremely helpful to us. Otherwise, I said, the current popular impression that the United States was appeasing Vichy in direct contradiction to British wishes would continue to spread.</p>
<p>The Prime Minister did not agree with this suggestion.</p>
<p>I then asked the President to use his personal influence on Churchill to deal with this unusual situation. But Mr. Roosevelt said he had done what he could and could do no more. The attitudes of the President and the Prime Minister were so contrary to their later attitudes, because later both of them were extremely hostile to De Gaulle and remained so.</p>
<p>I immediately drafted a proposed agreement that I believed could be acceptable to the United States, Britain, and Canada, and that De Gaulle could agree to the withdrawal of Free French forces from these two islands. This stipulated that the United States, Britain, and Canada would jointly supervise the two islands, neutralizing and demilitarizing them.</p>
<p>The President agreed to my proposed solution. We then presented it to Mr. Churchill. He indicated his acceptance, conditional on De Gaulle's agreement. At the same time, Pétain had indicated his agreement. But De Gaulle refused.</p>
<p>De Gaulle never agreed to our proposed agreement to resolve the dispute.</p>
<p>Finally, as the commotion caused by the incident gradually subsided, I felt that the wisest course of action was to put the matter aside until the end of the war. The President agreed to my suggestion, and so the matter gradually dwindled into one of history's footnotes, when at the time it had the dangerous potential to develop into an entire chapter of history.</p>
<p>Our relationship with De Gaulle was not improved by the incident. In the minds of the President or myself personally, there was no doubt that De Gaulle was personally responsible for violating his obligations to Britain and directly violating the will of the United States and Canada. We believed that his personal ambitions were too great and that he was not as reliable as we had previously imagined.</p>
<p>Regarding myself, the President's refusal to exert pressure on Mr. Churchill to clarify Anglo-American relations over the De Gaulle and Vichy issues was one of several factors that almost led me to resign as Secretary of State in January 1942. I really wanted to resign and actually wrote a note in pencil, submitting my resignation.</p>
<p>Perhaps it is appropriate here to summarize our policy towards Vichy. Unfortunately, this policy aroused so much emotional agitation in the United States that even today, some people still believe that it was worthless, just a most tragic piece of darkness. Among these people, some seem like certain readers of history who always pay attention to the dramatic figures on horseback, blindly following them, seeing no faults in them, and treating all those who refuse to recognize their authority as deadly enemies. Strangely, many British and Americans regard De Gaulle as Joan of Arc, supporting him even more enthusiastically than most French people who follow him.</p>
<p>The first point is that President Roosevelt and I held the same views on both Vichy and De Gaulle.</p>
<p>The second point is that Prime Minister Churchill also firmly supported the maintenance of relations with Vichy, as advocated by the President and myself. Sometimes Eden did so as well, even though they themselves criticized Vichy, making it difficult to maintain relations.</p>
<p>The third point is that our relationship with Vichy gave us tangible benefits, namely, maintaining contact in Vichy France and French North Africa. If we had broken off relations with Vichy, this contact would have been completely severed.</p>
<p>In addition, it also allowed our representatives to remain in the area and try to convince France that no matter how long the war lasted, the Allies would win, and Vichy France should not cooperate with Germany. At the same time, it was possible to keep the French people's fundamental concept of freedom alive in their minds and hope that France's free system would be restored. Furthermore, it played a role in preventing the transfer of bases and materials to Germany in May 1941. This relationship also had an impact on preventing the French fleet from falling into German hands.</p>
<p>The fourth point is that if we had completely broken off relations with Vichy or forced Pétain into Hitler's arms, we would not have been able to find a prominent French leader with whom we could have a relationship. Diplomatically recognizing De Gaulle completely was equivalent to diplomatically no longer recognizing Vichy. The disadvantages to us clearly outweighed the advantages. But we did indeed go so far as to provide De Gaulle with military assistance, trying to make him a military leader and general of the French army, as he should have been, and hoping that he would later separate himself from political relations and focus solely on fighting the Germans on the battlefield.</p>
<p>The fifth point, and the most important, is that our relationship with Vichy allowed us to have consuls in North Africa, which paved the way and left room for planning and dispatching Anglo-American expeditionary forces to the western Mediterranean and for assisting British forces in their activities east of that region.</p>

<h3>On the Eve of the Assembly Meeting, Receptions Held to Solicit Opinions from Various Districts, Half of the 217 Senators Have Already Registered, Mayor's Report on Governance to Open This Morning</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] The fifth plenary session of the first Shanghai Municipal Council will officially open at 9:00 AM today in the assembly hall of the council on Tanggu Road. The first meeting will be held from 10:00 AM to 12:00 PM, where Mayor Wu will report on governance. There will be a recess in the afternoon. The second meeting will be held tomorrow afternoon from 2:00 PM, featuring work reports from the directors of the Finance, Education, and Land Administration Bureaus, as well as inquiries from the senators regarding finance, education, and land administration, and the directors' responses. As of yesterday, 118 senators had registered, and it is expected that more will attend today. Senators from the Democratic Socialist and Youth Parties are participating in this meeting, totaling 217 people. The seating arrangement for the senators will be re-determined by drawing lots. The secretariat of the council has received 41 proposals as of yesterday. The municipal government's report on governance has also been submitted to the council.</p>
<p>Council Speaker Pan and Deputy Speaker Xu of the Municipal Council believe that the district chiefs and chairmen of the district people's representative assemblies in various districts of the city are all representatives of the people. However, due to time constraints during council meetings, they do not have the opportunity to express their opinions one by one. Therefore, a reception was specially arranged on the eve of the meeting, at 3:00 PM yesterday, to invite the district chiefs and chairmen of the representative assemblies to solicit their opinions, so as to submit them to the general assembly for discussion. In addition, the council has also scheduled the fourth meeting on the 26th to invite representatives elected by the district chiefs and representative assemblies to attend the general assembly and report. In addition to the district chiefs and people's representatives, those who attended yesterday's tea party included Municipal Council members, Secretary-General Zonglian Shen representing Mayor Wu, and directors of various bureaus, totaling about 80 people.</p>
<p>Council Speaker Pan presided over the reception and stated in his speech that this year is the year of constitutional governance for the country. However, due to the rebellion of the communist bandits, it is necessary to first suppress the rebellion. Superficially, suppressing the rebellion is a military matter and seems incompatible with the implementation of constitutional governance. However, in fact, to implement constitutional governance, the communist bandits cannot be allowed to rebel, so it is necessary to suppress the rebellion, which is actually the work of the people. How to advance local autonomy from political tutelage to constitutional governance is something that representatives of the people should discuss as much as possible, putting aside personal relationships and thinking for the citizens, and then submit your opinions to the general assembly of the council for discussion.</p>
<p>Secretary-General Shen then stated in his speech that implementing democracy requires respecting public opinion. In the future, local handling of conscription, allocation of food, etc., will increase the workload in various districts, and implementation may be difficult. It is hoped that the district chiefs and people's representatives will raise these issues, so that the municipal government can understand and promote the improvement of municipal administration.</p>
<p>Opinions Expressed One After Another</p>
<p>Subsequently, the chairmen of the district people's representative assemblies and the district chiefs spoke one after another. The chairman of the Xincheng District People's Representative Assembly stated that based on past student movements, dance bans, labor strikes, and other events, there may be communist elements causing trouble, but considering the actual situation, it can be seen that the central government's consideration of the implementation of laws and regulations may not be thorough enough, resulting in such consequences. Therefore, it is hoped that in the future, before implementing laws and regulations, the central government should first seek the opinion of the council. The chairman of the Yangshupu District People's Representative Assembly requested three points: (1) The Municipal Council had previously approved the establishment of municipal primary and secondary schools in the district, but they have not yet been established. It is hoped that they can be implemented soon. (2) The rear hospital No. 25 is located in this district, and local thugs often exploit the wounded soldiers and commit all kinds of evil deeds. It is requested that the municipal government find a way to relocate the hospital. (3) The branch roads in the district from south to north are extremely dirty and unsightly. It is hoped that they can be improved. A representative from Pudong District, seeing newspaper reports that household registration will be handled by the police bureau, believed it was inappropriate and requested the council to explain the reasons to the Executive Yuan so that it would still be handled by the district office.</p>
<p>Dissatisfaction with Rent Standards</p>
<p>A representative from the Laozha District expressed dissatisfaction with the rent standards passed by the municipal administration meeting, saying that the municipal government's investigation that rents on Nanjing Road were 30,000 or 40,000 times higher than before was inaccurate. According to the actual investigation of general household rents by the district people's representative assembly, the maximum was less than 10,000 times. That is, the previous dispute in the district caused by Hartung's unreasonable rent adjustment was only 3,000 to 8,000 times. The Chang Bureau should consider the interests of general households and not use large hotels, large shops, and large buildings as the standard. The district chief of Zhabei District said that the district office is often surrounded and disturbed by citizens. The government and bureaus should cooperate. Suppressing the rebellion should not only focus on military affairs, but must pay attention to whether the people cooperate. It is hoped that the people's self-defense force will be increased and the Baojia system will be strengthened. In addition, there are many refugees in Zhabei, and it is hoped that they can be provided with relief. A representative from Tilanqiao asked the authorities to think more about the poor and not make the poor bear taxes in the same way while only the rich enjoy the benefits. There is no water or electricity in some areas of the district, causing great suffering. A representative from Wusong District said that the location designated by the Land Administration Bureau for the district office is far away at Paotai Bay, more than three miles away from the town, which is extremely inconvenient. It is hoped that a portion of the public land of the God of Wealth Temple at the intersection of the Chamber of Commerce Road can be allocated. There were also those who did not have time to speak, and their opinions were submitted in writing.</p>
<p>Subsequently, Ren Xianqun of the Civil Food Distribution Committee attended and reported on the issue of rice distribution. (See page 7)</p>
<p>Finally, Deputy Speaker Xu stated in his speech that the issues discussed at this council meeting are quite numerous, such as suppressing the rebellion, conscription, public security, rent, tax increases, etc., all of which are very important. The first thing to be reported to everyone is that all cases will be resolved reasonably by the council, and those that cannot be implemented will definitely be rejected impartially. Suburban citizens receive fewer benefits because they are far away and cannot be taken care of. It is not that the municipal government favors urban citizens. It is also hoped that the municipal authorities will pay attention to both near and far in the future. The reception ended at about 5:00 PM.</p>
<h3>Zhao Banfu, Deputy Director of the Social Affairs Bureau, Takes Office Today</h3>
<p>Zhao Lifu, advisor to the Social Affairs Bureau, has been ordered to be promoted to Deputy Director of the Social Affairs Bureau and will take office this morning. The former Deputy Director, Jianhua Li, has been transferred to serve as a counselor to the municipal government.</p>
<h3>Zhang Xiaosong Intends to Retire, Feels Conscription is Difficult to Handle</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] The municipal election office is scheduled to cease operations at the end of this month, and the staff will be transferred back to their original agencies, but the office will not be closed. Zhang Xiaosong has recently expressed his intention to retire again. According to him, this has nothing to do with the election. The main reason is that the conscription issue is difficult to handle. The district defense headquarters has telegraphed the city to hand over 1,500 draftees by the end of March. A conscription meeting will be held on the 29th of this month, where this will be discussed.</p>
<h3>Shi Meiyu Arrives in Shanghai from Nanjing, Denies Taking Position as Presiding Judge of the Special Criminal Court</h3>
<p>Shi Meiyu, Presiding Judge of the Military Tribunal for the Trial of War Criminals under the Ministry of National Defense, arrived in Shanghai from Nanjing yesterday. According to reporters, the trial of war criminals will end between April and May. There are still more than one hundred pending cases, which are being expedited. Shi denied rumors that he will also serve as Presiding Judge of the Special Criminal Court.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Lixing Friendship Society Holds New Year's Party Tonight</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Lixing Friendship Society is a friendship group organized by key figures from the financial, industrial, and commercial sectors in the city. Through a year of promotion, the number of members has increased to more than 170. In order to celebrate the Spring Festival and congratulate members Pan Gongzhan, Fang Zhi, Luo Beichen, Shui Xiangyun, and Xu Enzeng on being elected to the National Assembly, Zhang Fengzeng on being elected as an alternate delegate to the National Assembly, and Ma Shuli, Wang Genzhong, Fei Xia, and others on being elected as members of the Legislative Yuan, Wang Zhuyi and Xie Renzhao on being elected as alternate members of the Legislative Yuan, a New Year's party will be held at the Hushe at 6:00 PM today. In addition to wonderful Peking opera performances such as Dr. Mei Lanfang's son and daughter Bao Yue and Bao Jiu jointly performing "Silang Visits His Mother," and the Xiasheng Drama School performing the famous play "Baluo and" (Hong Bi Yuan), and cross-talk performances by Tu Yunfu and Jiang Shaolin, there will also be raffles and other entertainment.</p>
<h3>Draftees Aged 21 to be Selected First, Starting Next Month, Funding of One Hundred Billion Needed</h3>
<p>According to reliable sources, after the city's conscription meeting is held on the 29th of this month, the conscription work will begin on the first of next month, first handling the investigation of the draftees' family backgrounds, and then proceeding with the procedures of registering and reviewing, etc. It is expected that 6,000 draftees will be recruited by the end of June. This time, a lottery method will be used. The age of the qualified draftees will be from 21 to 24. The lottery will be drawn from those aged 21 first. If the number of 6,000 is reached, no more 22-year-old draftees will be drawn. Otherwise, those aged 22 and above will be drawn year by year until the quota is filled. The problem now is the conscription funds, because the total expenditure last year was 12 billion. This year, the estimated cost for each draftee, such as uniforms, food and lodging, welfare, and family support, will reach more than 10 million. Then the number of 6,000 will reach 100 billion. This is indeed a huge figure, and Changju is working hard to raise funds for this.</p>
<h3>Deadline for Demolition on Tianmu Road Expires Again: Residents Reiterate Previous Request to Avoid Demolition, Appoint Representatives to Continue Appeals to Authorities</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper News] The Tianmu Road demolition incident caused a sensation last year. At that time, due to repeated appeals from local residents, Mayor Wu personally inspected the area and approved a temporary postponement of the demolition until after the Spring Festival. Now that the deadline has expired again, residents, facing the current housing shortage, feel unable to relocate. Therefore, they earnestly request that the authorities exempt them from demolition. Recently, they have again appointed representatives to continue appealing to various government agencies, including the Municipal Government and the Municipal Council. Yesterday at 3:00 PM, they hosted the press to issue a public statement, stating that Tianmu Road (formerly Jielu Road) is a combination of Old Xinmin Road and Tianmu Road, with a width of more than 60 feet, which is two to three times the width of Zhejiang North Road and Henan South Road. Usually, vehicles and pedestrians move freely, a world apart from the traffic congestion and chaos on Nanjing Road, Jiangxi Road, and Fujian Road. Furthermore, the north side of Tianmu Road was widened by 28 feet in March of the 36th year [of the Republic, i.e., 1947], leaving ample space. Therefore, no matter which train arrives at the North Station, there is absolutely no crowding of vehicles or pedestrians, as seen by officials and travelers to and from Beijing and Shanghai. If the purpose of demolition and road widening is merely to improve the appearance of the city and seek grandeur, then all the buildings on Tianmu Road, whether newly built or old, are above average and do not obstruct the view. If the municipal authorities truly have the determination and concrete plans to improve urban traffic, they should prioritize widening congested areas first, making the widening of Tianmu Road unnecessary (point one). Moreover, the houses on Tianmu Road are densely packed, and the residents rely on them for their livelihoods and businesses. Once the houses are destroyed, they will have nowhere to live and will face the hardship of relocation. Shops and factories will close, leading to unemployment. School children will be unable to transfer schools, resulting in interrupted education. All of these factors will increase social unrest (point two). Furthermore, due to the Communist bandits harming the country, the Central Government has issued a clear order for mobilization to suppress the rebellion and to simplify the suppression, which is promulgated nationwide. Unless it is a construction project that is essential for people's livelihood and unavoidable, all projects should be stopped. Now, the residential shops on Tianmu Road number in the hundreds, including many high-rise buildings worth hundreds of millions. Once demolished, the losses will be enormous. The residents will be swept away by the flood, and the municipal authorities will not only waste the national treasury but also violate the national policy of saving resources for the suppression of the rebellion (point three), and so on.</p>
<h3>Chairman Pan Submits a Motion Requesting the Central Government to Clearly Define the Organization of the Shanghai Municipal Bank</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper News] Yesterday, the Municipal Council received more than ten motions, including: (1) A motion submitted by Chairman Pan, the content of which is to request the Central Government to clearly define the organization of the Shanghai Municipal Bank. If it is a joint public-private venture, it should be a joint stock venture in accordance with the law. If it belongs to the provincial bank organization, it must also be supervised by representatives from local public opinion organs in accordance with the law. However, the current organization of the Municipal Bank, although publicly run, has not been handled according to regulations. (2) A motion submitted by Zhang Zhihan: "Please severely punish the masterminds who instigated thugs to destroy the Social Bureau, release the innocent, and withdraw the prohibition on dancing to promote the rule of law and ensure the well-being of the people." (3) A motion submitted by Yu Rupin: "When telephone subscribers apply to the city telephone company for additional extensions, they often delay or ignore the requests, resulting in longer call times and inconvenience to users." (4) Another motion: "Please request the Shanghai Telecommunications Bureau to set up public telephones in Zhabei and the four suburbs to benefit the citizens and improve public safety." (5) A motion submitted by Wang Weiqin: "Please ask the government to use real estate as collateral for bank loans to revitalize land finance in the city and alleviate the housing shortage." (6) A motion submitted by Qian Songping: "Please stop armed personnel from extorting money under the guise of investigating building permits in the suburbs." (7) A motion submitted by Rong Hongsan: "Suggest that the Central Government's new plan for local administrative facilities should be submitted to public opinion organs for review and approval before implementation to ensure prudence, and that powers should be unified to increase administrative efficiency." (8) A motion submitted by Chen Peide: "Please stipulate the time for dumping manure to emphasize hygiene, and please stipulate the daily fee to avoid disturbing citizens." (9) A motion submitted by Zhang Zhongyuan: "Please expedite the construction of the art museum on the land dedicated for that purpose."</p>

<h3>Seeking Welfare for Tenants: Organizing a Tenants' Union</h3>
<p>Since the municipal government meeting passed the method of calculating rent according to index standards, all tenants in the city believe that this method is obviously biased because the municipal government meeting only has representatives from the real estate industry and no representatives from the tenants' association. They have jointly launched the establishment of the Shanghai City Tenants' Union and submitted a request to the Social Department and the Social Bureau to approve the organization of the Jiangsu Provincial Tenants' Union as a precedent in order to seek welfare for all tenants in the city on a regular basis. The initiators of the organization of the union include the Nanjing Road Business Federation and the Tenant Joint Office of the British firm Arnhold &amp; Co., Ltd., the Yuxingli Tenants' Association, and the Cihou Northli Tenants' Association, etc., more than ten organizations.</p>
<h3>Fellow Townsmen of Songjiang in Shanghai Held a Dinner Yesterday Afternoon</h3>
<p>Fellow townsmen of Songjiang in Shanghai held a dinner party at the YMCA of Eight Immortals Bridge yesterday afternoon. More than 70 people attended, including Zhang Shutong, Zhang Huanzhi, Zhao Zukang, Zhu Wen, Zhang Liangzhi, Xia Changfan, and Jiang Weisheng. During the dinner, Zhang Huanzhi reported on local political situation, followed by Zhao Zukang's speech, emphasizing the importance of developing highway construction to benefit industry and commerce. Finally, Zhang Zenghui, who will soon study engineering abroad, expressed his farewell wishes. Everyone gathered together and parted happily.</p>
<h3>Lake Society Holds Spring Tea Party, Welcoming Fellow Townsmen to Participate</h3>
<p>The Lake Society on Guizhou Road in this city is a group of fellow townsmen from the six counties of the Lake region who are living abroad. In order to provide more opportunities for the society's members and fellow townsmen to connect, it is scheduled to hold a Spring Tea Party at 6:00 PM on the 24th (the Lantern Festival of the lunar calendar). Chen Aishi, Pan Gongzhan, and Qian Xinzhi will preside over the event. There will be lantern festival drums, amateur opera performances, and literary riddles for guests to enjoy. The cost of the meal is 200,000 yuan per person, and reservations are required in advance. All fellow townsmen, regardless of gender, are welcome to participate.</p>
<h3>New Year's Garbage Cleared Yesterday</h3>
<p>Flying Squads Organized for Scheduled Operations</p>
<p>The amount of garbage in the city increased sharply during the Lunar New Year, increasing by 500 to 800 tons per day. Usually, there are only 2,400 to 2,500 tons, but during the New Year, there was an average of 2,900 tons per day. On the fifth day of the New Year, it reached 3,600 tons. Due to the heavy fog a few days ago, the barge was suspended, resulting in nearly 2,000 tons of garbage piled up at wharves such as Maigen Road and Xinkai River. The garbage was not cleared until yesterday.</p>
<p>The Cleaning Corps of the Health Bureau has set up two dedicated telephone lines, 19923 and 13635, to facilitate citizens' requests for garbage removal. It has also newly repaired four trucks to form two flying squads. Two squad leaders, sixteen garbage collectors, and two drivers were transferred from the original organization. Each car is equipped with four efficient garbage collectors and one squad leader. One squad is stationed at the main workshop on Jianguo East Road, and the other is stationed at the sixth squadron's vehicle park on Sha Jing Road in Hongkou. It is planned to establish and dispatch them from March 1st.</p>
<h3>Traveler at Dafang Hotel Attempts Suicide</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper News] Zhang Genquan, a 22-year-old traveler from Fujian South Road Zhengjia Muqiao Kou Dafang Hotel Room 530, for unknown reasons, had thoughts of厌世at about 8:00 p.m. last night, 服煙水suicide, was later discovered by the waiter, and sent to Renji Hospital for treatment.</p>
<h3>Hoping to Promote the Spirit of the Northwest Nationalities, Preparing to Build a New Gansu: Guo Jiqiao Urges Fellow Students from Shanghai to Work Together</h3>
<p>The Gansu Alumni Association in Shanghai held a tea party at the Fudan Teahouse of Fudan University yesterday to welcome Guo Jiqiao, Chairman of Gansu Province. More than 200 people attended. The meeting was first welcomed by Mao Hongpan, chairman of the conference, followed by Guo's speech, the main points being: 1. The Northwest is the birthplace of Chinese national culture. The reasons for its backwardness are: (1) The scourge of feudal thinking, (2) The people themselves do not seek progress. 2. The Northwest has an important position. Our current urgent tasks are two, namely (1) to seek progress in unity, to truly do everything for the country, everything for the people, and to eliminate selfish and self-interested viewpoints, (2) to find a way out of difficulties. Gansu is poor and financially distressed. Last year, more than 92% of the annual expenditure was subsidized by the central government. Although the environment is difficult, we are now working hard to overcome the difficulties and develop economic proposals. For example, the original industrial and mining construction projects cooperated by the central and provincial governments are now being taken over by the provincial government to strive for development, and transportation and water conservancy construction are the most urgent needs for the construction of the Northwest. 3. The three main points of Gansu Province's administration include: (1) Integration of peacetime and wartime, (2) Layered responsibility, (3) Strengthening local self-defense forces. Guo also put forward the four major construction centers in the Northwest: (1) Self-defense (2) Production, (3) Culture, (4) Health. Finally, he put forward two hopes for the students in Shanghai: first, to promote the spirit of hard work, frugality, and hard work of the Northwest nationalities. Second, pay close attention to technical studies, and prepare to return home to serve and build a new home and a new Gansu. The speech was followed by a photo session and the meeting was adjourned. Guo visited Song Ziwen, Chairman of Guangdong Province, yesterday to exchange views on local provincial administration and had a pleasant conversation. He then left. Guo was originally scheduled to go to Beijing by night train last night to report on his duties, but it has been changed to tonight due to circumstances.</p>
<h3>Newly Created Motorized Tricycle: Beautiful Design, Convenient Driving, Travels at 35 Miles per Hour</h3>
<p>In this city, the government's austerity order is being implemented, so the issuance of car licenses and the distribution of gasoline are strictly restricted. Western tricycles violate humanity and obstruct the city's appearance, so they are also being eliminated. However, in this metropolis of millions, under these circumstances, the seriousness of the transportation problem will increase day by day. It is learned that Wang Errong Hua Kun brothers and Ji Lianfu of Litong Automobile Co., Ltd. on Nanchang Road in this city have created a kind of motorized tricycle, which is roughly similar to an ordinary tricycle, but the chassis is lower and the style is better. (The picture shows the speed reaching 35 miles per hour, and each gallon of gasoline can travel 75 miles. Driving is extremely easy, and it only takes five minutes to learn. Management is also very simple, and the selling price is only about twice as high as ordinary tricycles, which is not a huge expense. The oil consumption is extremely low, which does not conflict with the austerity order. At the same time, driving is convenient, no manpower is required, and the style is beautiful. It is heard that Litong Automobile Co., Ltd. believes that this motorized tricycle can solve a part of Shanghai's traffic problems, so it will submit a request to the Municipal Council for discussion at the conference, hoping to promote it. At the same time, according to the Wang brothers, ordinary tricycles can also be modified. The first batch of products has been completely ordered by Taiwanese customers for use. If the authorities in this city approve, this new type of vehicle will also be seen driving on the streets of this city.</p>
<h3>Charity Sale of Houses Progresses Smoothly: Expected to be Completed by the End of April as Scheduled, Alley Names Planned to Use "義" (yi - Righteousness)</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper News] The Charity House Building Department and Purchasing Group of the Winter Relief Committee held a meeting at the Public Works Bureau of the Municipal Government a few days ago, presided over by Zhao Jikang, Director of the Public Works Bureau, to report on the progress of the project and discuss ways to supply building materials on schedule. According to Director Zhao, after the meeting, the house building project is progressing very smoothly and is expected to be completed by the end of April as scheduled. The Charity Houses are divided into five sites, building five alleys. Watchman's residences will be added at the entrances of each alley. For the sake of prudence, a wall will be built around the alleys and decorated with exquisite door plaques. In order to commemorate the Charity Houses, the names of the alleys will begin with the character "義" (yi - Righteousness). In order to promote our country's ancient moral principles of "loyalty, filial piety, benevolence, love, faith, righteousness, and peace," the alleys are planned to be named "Yi Zhong New Village," "Yi Xiao New Village," "Yi Ren New Village," "Yi Ai New Village," etc. However, the official naming of the New Villages is planned to be presided over by Mayor Wu. In order to supervise that all projects are implemented strictly according to the drawings, a supervision team has been formed, with representatives from five groups: the Municipal Council, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, the Social Bureau, the Municipal Party Headquarters, and the General Labor Union, who will take turns inspecting the construction during the construction period.</p>
<p>Estimated Value: Expected to be 3 Billion</p>
<p>According to Director Zhao's careful estimate, the cost of a Class B house is about 700 million yuan, and a Class A house is 1 billion yuan. However, once completed in the future, the estimated value can reach 3 billion yuan. This is because the land for the Charity Houses is loaned interest-free by the National Bank, the building materials are supplied by the Winter Relief Committee, and the various construction industries undertake the project at the lowest labor price. In the future, when building raw materials rise and the cost of living increases sharply, the price of the houses will inevitably increase several times compared to the cost. Therefore, Director Zhao firmly believes that the Charity House lottery tickets will be sold out before the lottery draw in early March.</p>
<p>Construction Progress: Invitation to Visit</p>
<p>[Another Report] The Charity House Lottery Department of the Winter Relief Committee has determined that the lottery ceremony for the Class B tickets (i.e., those priced at 100,000 yuan each) will be held at the Municipal Gymnasium next Monday afternoon. The lottery method will still follow the original regulations, using three balls for the draw, which will be absolutely public. As for the Class A tickets (i.e., those priced at 200,000 yuan each), because they have not all been sold, the date of the lottery draw for the Class A tickets will be announced again when the Class B tickets are drawn on the first day of next month, but there will be no long delay.</p>

<h3>Regulations for the Custody of Traitor Houses to be Implemented by Order of the Enemy Property Office</h3>
<p>Regarding the regulations for the custody and use of traitor houses, the Enemy and Pseudo-Property Clearing Office has recently been ordered by the Executive Yuan to implement the following: Article 1: After a traitor's house has been sealed up in accordance with the law, before it is sold, a public agency may apply to the Executive Yuan for approval to take custody of it for use.

Article 5: The handover and charging of fees for the custody and use of traitor houses shall be handled by the local enemy and pseudo-property handling agencies. Article 6: After a judgment confiscating a traitor's house has been finalized, the house shall be sold by auction in principle.

Article 7: If a judgment determines that a traitor's house should be returned, the custody and use shall be terminated immediately and the property shall be returned to the owner.</p>
<h3>Youth Detained for Patronizing Prostitutes</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper News] Pan Songlin, a youth from Yongji, is 26 years old and lives at 17 Wenyuanfang, South Tibet Road. He is fond of women and often frequents prostitutes outside. Recently, he often does not return home at night. His wife, Xie Meiyue, probed in various ways and learned that Pan had a passionate affair with Cai Sibao, a prostitute from the Cai Sibao brothel at 65 Lane 3, Shantou Road (known as one of the "Four Little King Kongs" in the flower world). They often rented hotels for secret meetings. The night before, she learned that Pan had gone with Cai to the Jielu Hotel on Tibet Road and opened room 467. She did not move, but secretly reported to the Laozha Police Station at midnight. The police rushed to the scene and arrested the pair of illicit lovers and brought them to the police station, where they confessed to adultery without hesitation. It is reported that relatives and friends have come forward to mediate, and it is unlikely that they will go to court.</p>
<h3>Public Utility Bureau Considers Adjustment of Public Utility Prices Reasonable</h3>
<p>Since the implementation of the automatic adjustment formula for public utility prices, the prices of various public utilities in the city have been adjusted monthly. It is heard that some councilors will propose at the upcoming Municipal Council meeting to request the central government to cancel the automatic adjustment formula. The reporter asked Zhao Zengjue, Director of the Public Utility Bureau, for his opinion on this. According to him, the adoption of the automatic adjustment formula for public utilities is in accordance with the central government's orders, so that the major public utility companies will not face suspension due to excessive losses. The increase in the price of coal, gasoline, and the increase in foreign exchange rates are the main factors that have led to the increase in the prices of public utilities. The impact on the cost of living is still small. The central government used to adopt a subsidy policy for public utilities, but currently the central government cannot afford this subsidy, so the only reasonable way is to apply the automatic adjustment method.</p>
<h3>Iron Block Explosion Injures Squatter</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper News] Jiang Guozhu, a squatter in the Sun Temple squatter area in Zhabei, was injured in his left hand and head by an explosion at about 5:50 p.m. yesterday when he was hammering an old iron block. He was taken to the Pingmin Hospital for treatment.</p>
<h3>Wharf Worker Exposed for Stealing Items from Haihuang Steamer on First Attempt</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper News] The state-run China Merchants Bureau sent a thief, Yu Jinguang, to the District Prosecutor's Office for investigation the day before yesterday. On the 18th of this month, when the China Merchants Bureau's Haihuang Steamer was berthed in Jiangxin, three wharf workers stole two pulleys and tarpaulins from the steamer onto a small boat, and fled along the side of the ship. They were spotted by the inspectors on the steamer, who ordered them to stop. The wharf workers on the boat were anxious and accelerated their escape, pushing the stolen goods into the river in an attempt to destroy the evidence. Because the small boat was moving very fast, they eventually escaped. After investigation, wharf worker Yu Jinguang was suspected, arrested, and interrogated. Yu confessed to theft, saying: "I originally wanted to work on the Haihuang Steamer, but I was late and didn't get the job. Seeing them stealing items from the steamer successfully, I temporarily joined in, wanting to get a share, but I was exposed on my first attempt. As for the other two wharf workers, because they were temporary partners, I don't know their names."</p>
<h3>Romance on the Same Boat Leads to Elopement After Marriage</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper News] Wang Ruxiang of Cheng Ba, residing at 49 Meiquanli, East Taiwan Road, married Yuan Bingwang, a girl of the same village and age, through a matchmaker on December 20th last year. Unexpectedly, six days after the marriage, Bingyu eloped and did not return. Afterwards, Wang searched everywhere. It was not until 9:00 AM yesterday morning that he learned that Bingyu was hiding in the squatter area at the southern end of Dapuqiao, South Central Zhinan Road, living with Yang Zhengfan, a fellow villager. He reported the information to the Songshan Police Station, who arrested Yang and brought him to the station for interrogation. According to Bingyu, she was escorted to Shanghai by her brother Bingyao before her marriage. When she took a civilian boat, she met Yang and they fell in love at first sight. A relationship then developed. After the marriage, Yang continued to pursue her, lingering in the alley every day, inviting her out. She was moved by him and is now willing to follow Yang and become his wife, and does not want to return to Wang, etc. The police station believes that Yang is suspected of enticement and plans to hand him over to the District Prosecutor's Office for legal action.</p>

<h3>Traitor Zhou Bingding to be Interrogated Today: Fan Wenliu's Wife Seeks Justice for Her Husband</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper News] Traitor Zhou Xiaobing was originally a subordinate of Zhao Yousheng, the commander of the Second Brigade of the puppet Jiading County. He was fond of killing people. He was arrested after the victory and is currently detained at the Tilanqiao High Court Detention Center. The Special Criminal Court of the High Court is scheduled to hold a trial today. According to Fan Jinshi, the wife of the victim Fan Wenliu, she filed a complaint with the High Court, stating: "My husband, Fan Wenliu, studied poetry and books since childhood and understood the great righteousness. He served as the village chief of this village for more than ten years before the war. During the War of Resistance against Japan, he refused to take up guerrilla work and went through all kinds of hardships, which is well known to the local people. However, because the matter was not kept secret, Zhou Xiaobing, a notorious bully under Zhao Yousheng (on the run), the commander of the Second Brigade of the puppet Jiading County, who was known for killing people without blinking an eye, learned of it. On the fourth day of the first month of the lunar calendar in the 29th year of the Republic [i.e., 1940], while my husband was returning home from visiting relatives in Shanghai for the New Year, when he passed by the Tianzu Temple in Luyang Village, he was kidnapped to Maqiao without asking for any reason and shot to death immediately, and his body was thrown into the field. After I learned of it, I asked people to search everywhere. Three days later, I finally found him in the field west of Maqiao, but his clothes were stripped off, and his flesh and blood were blurred, making it difficult to recognize him. The misery of the situation is difficult to describe. Because the area was all under the control of the enemy and puppet forces at the time, there was no way to appeal. For eight years, the grievance has been suppressed until now. Recently, I learned that Zhou Xiaobing, the murderer who killed my husband, has been arrested. I am filing a complaint to pursue the truth of the crime and plead with your court to investigate."</p>
<h3>National Drug Trafficking Case: Two More Key Criminals Arrested in Wuxi</h3>

<h3>National Grain Merchant Representatives Gather for the Inaugural Meeting of the Grain Association, Today's Election of Directors and Supervisors and Discussion of Proposals</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] The first general meeting of members of the National Federation of Grain Business Associations of the Republic of China officially opened yesterday (the 22nd) at 2:30 PM on the third floor of 377 Minguo Road. In attendance were the Minister of Social Affairs, the Minister of Food, Ye Shifu representing the Mayor, Lu Jing, the Deputy Minister of the Central Agricultural and Industrial Department, Chen Quan representing the Ministry of Economic Affairs, Ji Mingzhai representing the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau, Wang Xiaolai, the chairman of the National Federation of Commerce, and over a hundred other guests and member representatives, all gathered together. The opening ceremony concluded at 4:00 PM, followed by a ten-minute break, and then the first general meeting commenced, adjourning at approximately 6:00 PM.</p>
<p>Yesterday's membership included representatives from 18 provinces and 9 municipalities under the direct administration of the Executive Yuan, accounting for about seven-tenths of the country. Among them were four provincial federations (Zhejiang, Anhui, Sichuan, and Jiangsu), and nine municipalities, totaling thirteen units. There were fifteen provincial municipalities, totaling twenty units, and sixty-one county-level units, totaling sixty-seven units. In total, 104 member units participated, with over seventy representatives actually present, and approximately sixty proposals received. The presidium of the general meeting consisted of fifteen people, including Wan Molin, Huang Tongsheng, Zhang Chao, Wang Zhupu, Qu Zhenhua, He Jinwen, Han Dezhao, Zhang Jingwei, Chen Yucai, Zhao Zhangji, Chen Xinzhi, Cai Yushu, Zong Minglun, Yan Jikuan, and Peng Zuo.</p>
<p>A Bridge Between Grain Merchants and the Government</p>
<p>At the opening ceremony, the preparatory director of the association, Wan Molin, first read the opening remarks, stating briefly: This association, after five months of preparation, is now officially established, and we are deeply grateful for the participation of government officials, guests from all walks of life, and grain merchant representatives from various provinces and cities. He then continued to say that the domestic rice issue today is not as dire as imagined. The global food shortage problem is also not as severe as it was last year. Furthermore, last year's domestic rice harvest reached about 70%. As long as there is proper regulation, there should be no issue with rice. Currently, five major cities, including Beijing and Shanghai, have already begun rationing food. Grain also accounts for a large portion of the relief supplies from the United States. The government is actively enriching the grain supply and stabilizing society and the people's livelihood, and the industry should also study how to enable cooperation between the government and the people, so that everyone has food to eat and the strength to eat it.</p>
<p>Then Qu Zhenhua of the presidium delivered a speech, briefly stating: The establishment of this association is a bridge between grain merchants and the government. In the future, we hope to promote cooperation between the government and grain merchants through this. Qu then invited government officials and guests to speak in succession.</p>
<p>Minister Gu Hopes for Two Points</p>
<p>Minister Gu gave a speech, briefly stating: The existence of a national united organization of grain merchants is the first since the founding of the Republic of China. This move has significant meaning for food itself, people's livelihood, and the suppression of the rebellion. Articles 1 and 7 of the Commercial Association Law clearly stipulate the purpose and tasks of commercial associations. Therefore, regarding the establishment of your association, I hope for two points: (1) Strive to improve the organization of your association, achieve the tasks of a commercial association in accordance with a specific purpose, and in addition to safeguarding the interests of the industry, also correct the malpractices of the industry. (2) Assist the government in implementing food policies to stabilize society, people's livelihood, and the economy. Food is the most important thing for the people, so I hope that grain merchants will take on the responsibility of regulation, and in particular, pay attention to safeguarding the interests of the industry under the premise of safeguarding national and social interests.</p>
<p>Minister Yu and Ye Shifu, the representative of Mayor Wu, delivered speeches, hoping that grain merchants would assist the government in stabilizing grain prices. From Mayor Wu's position, he especially hopes that the grain prices in the Shanghai market can be stabilized for a long time.</p>
<p>Chen Quan, the representative of the Ministry of Economic Affairs, gave a speech, briefly stating: I hope that the mission of your association is not only to safeguard the interests of the industry, but also to study how to exert the contribution of the federation. Therefore, I deeply hope that your association will take on the responsibility of guiding grain merchants.</p>
<p>Grain Financing Should be Opened</p>
<p>After the guest Wang Xiaolai gave a speech, Ren Xianqun of the People's Food Allocation Association gave a speech. Ren made three points: (1) The current grain price is not considered high compared to general commodity prices. Therefore, I personally advocate that grain prices should have a reasonable level compared to general commodity prices. The Four Joint Offices has passed measures for national banks and agencies to handle financing for daily necessities, with a monthly interest rate of only five percent, which can reduce transportation costs. Therefore, I personally advocate that grain financing should be opened first. (2) The transportation capacity of grain merchants after the war is far inferior to that before the war, resulting in a shortage of food reserves in some consumption areas. According to statistics, the city's food reserves are only 200,000 dan, so it is not easy to stabilize grain prices for a long time. After studying the situation, it is proposed that the Ministry of Food open grain financing for some cities and store some grain. (3) Under the situation where Shanghai's grain prices are inverted with those in the interior, I deeply feel that today's grain prices cannot be controlled, so I sincerely hope that the government will find a way to restore Shanghai as a center for grain transit, so as to stabilize grain prices.</p>
<h3>Build a Food Fortress and Eliminate the Root of Internal Chaos</h3>
<p>Finally, Ji Mingzhai, the representative of the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau, gave a speech, suggesting that after the representatives return to their respective places after the closing of the conference, they should establish food fortresses separately and jointly eliminate the root of internal chaos.</p>
<p>After the opening ceremony was completed, the first general meeting was held at 4:10 PM. In addition to distributing the preparatory report, Chairman Zhang Chao of the Presidium discussed and passed the association's charter, and the meeting adjourned at about 6:00 PM. The preparatory committee of the conference hosted all the attending representatives at the sixth floor of the China Merchants Bureau on Guangdong Road.</p>
<p>The conference is scheduled to convene group review meetings this morning, and the second general meeting will be held at 2:00 PM this afternoon to elect directors and supervisors and discuss proposals. If time permits, the closing ceremony will be held at 5:00 PM this afternoon. The elected first board of directors and supervisors are scheduled to be sworn in at 2:00 PM on the 24th, followed by the first meeting of the board of directors and supervisors.</p>
<h3>Improve Nutrition for the Seriously Injured and Sick, Preparing to Set Up Military Service Stations</h3>
<p>The Joint Logistics Headquarters, in order to plan for various military hospitals and improve the special nutrition of seriously injured and sick military officers and soldiers, specially dispatched Zhu Jingtao, the director of the News Department of the headquarters, to Shanghai. Yesterday, at the Shanghai Port Command, he invited relevant personnel to hold a meeting. After Zhu explained the mission to Shanghai, he immediately discussed thoroughly improving the staple and non-staple foods for injured and sick soldiers, and handling special nutrition issues for seriously injured and sick soldiers. It was decided that the Joint Logistics Headquarters would invite the Military Friends Association to first prepare to set up military service stations for wounded soldiers in the above-mentioned four wounded soldier hospitals, specializing in improving the special nutrition of military casualties. After successful results are achieved, it will be promoted to other military hospitals across the country.</p>
<h3>Gonghexiang Wharf Warehouse, Cotton Burning Causes Heavy Losses</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] At about 3:00 PM yesterday, a large batch of foreign-made cotton was suddenly burned in the Gonghexiang Wharf warehouse in Hongkou. It was not until about half an hour later that the fire department drove to the scene to extinguish the fire, causing significant losses.</p>

<h3>Looking at the Issue of Royal Restoration</h3>
<p>— First Letter, Special Correspondent Mao Shuqing</p>
<p>[Reuters, Brussels, Fourteenth] Brussels, known as "Little Paris," the Western European flower capital, has become larger and more prosperous than the real Paris after this war.</p>
<p>Having traveled across the European continent for more than half a year since leaving New York, this is the first time I have seen such beautiful department stores and such a prosperous market scene in Brussels. In the evening twilight, if you stand at the North Railway Station of Brussels and look south at the parallel wide roads and the neon lights that rival New York's Times Square, a foreign tourist will be dazzled. In Belgium, you can buy the most expensive French cosmetics, the most modern American fashions, and the most valuable British cigarettes. Belgium also nominally has a "coupon" rationing system, but any store welcomes customers with "coupon" tickets. The Belgian market is free, so free that genuine American goods are more reasonably priced than in New York. A pair of American "nylon" stockings selling for one and a half dollars costs only forty-two Belgian francs in Brussels (about ninety-seven cents). Camel brands, Morris brands, Lucky Strike brands, and a large number of American cigarettes may be cheaper than even the best Belgian cigarettes. Dozens of movie theaters in Brussels, with the exception of a very few that maintain traditional spirits, are almost uniformly showing Hollywood new releases. If it is said that the massive production of the United States after the war must find a market for "dumping" in Europe, Belgium is undoubtedly one of the best in their eyes.</p>
<p>This Year's United Nations General Assembly</p>
<p>To be held in Europe, the Secretary-General of the United Nations, Mr. Lie, roamed Europe a few days ago to find a "suitable" city. Lie was warmly welcomed in Belgium, and the Brussels municipal authorities are doing their best to win this trophy. According to estimates by Belgian friends, holding a United Nations General Assembly would require at least four or five thousand people, or even six or seven thousand people. It would be difficult to find a city in Europe that can unconditionally and continuously supply such a large amount of material consumption, but Brussels has that qualification. According to them, the only shortcoming is that Brussels cannot find a large venue. There is one in the countryside, but it is too far from the city center. The Nine-Power Treaty Conference was held in Brussels in the past, but that was only on a small scale. The scale of the United Nations General Assembly is undoubtedly much larger.</p>
<p>Prosperity is Never Accidental</p>
<p>First, Belgium's political stability. Although Belgium experienced a major "royal dispute" after the war, Emperor Leopold III remained in Switzerland very sensibly. Recently, he even leisurely took a boat to the New World to roam. Prince Charles, the brother of Leopold III, is now the Regent of Belgium, a typical royal family member who is quiet and self-loving and is very much loved by the Belgian people. Therefore, in general, Belgium's politics are stable. After this war, Belgium also had a considerable number of communists. As a result of last year's election, the Communist Party won four seats in the Senate and twenty-three seats in the House of Representatives (the House of Representatives has a total of two hundred and two seats). However, the Communist Party of Belgium has rarely had disputes. They take a consistent stance with the Socialist Party on opposing the restoration of Leopold III and are very persistent. Other than that, they have no further intentions. When I arrived in Belgium in 1945, people throughout Belgium liked to talk about the "royal issue." More than two years have passed, and the issue has not yet been resolved, but the Belgian people are much more indifferent. After Mr. Spaak, the former President of the United Nations General Assembly, was honorably appointed Prime Minister of Belgium last year, the Parliament passed a resolution authorizing Spaak to negotiate in detail with Emperor Leopold on whether to restore the throne and what conditions would apply. Spaak has the preliminary full power to decide. Before the Emperor crossed to America, Spaak took his entourage to Switzerland once. It is said that he talked with the Emperor for two hours. The royal family provided a lot of evidence that Leopold opposed the Nazi fascists, proving that he did not willingly "submit" to Hitler. The most powerful piece of evidence was that the Emperor once had a secret "blood edict" that was brought to the Belgian government-in-exile in London a year before the Nazi collapse, advocating "fighting to the end and the Nazis will be defeated." This matter was published in a newspaper. However, Spaak's trip to Switzerland was not made public. What is the medicine in the gourd? Outsiders have no way of knowing. One day, I was eating at the home of an aristocrat who had relatives in the royal family. The Baroness told me: "All the devout Catholic believers in Belgium welcome the Emperor to return." She also determined that Spaak himself also loved the royal family, "because he is a capable and visionary politician." Later, I asked a gentleman from the Belgian Ministry of Foreign Affairs. He shook his head and said, "Let's not talk about this issue. This issue is now in a state of hibernation." However, after I repeatedly circled the question, he said, "The current Prime Minister Spaak is a Socialist, and the Socialist Party's decision is to oppose the Emperor's restoration!" He laughed and said, "So, the problem becomes complicated, and the reason for the complexity lies here!"</p>
<p>Those who oppose the restoration of the royal family are not only the Socialist Party. The Communist Party is undoubtedly the "obvious responsibility," and some people in the Liberal Party also express the same opinion. Only the Catholic Party is 100% purely "royalist."</p>
<p>The Catholic Party has always been the largest political party in Belgium. Currently, out of the forty-four seats in the Senate, the Catholic Party has twenty-one seats. Out of the two hundred and two seats in the House of Representatives, the Catholic Party occupies ninety-two seats. They almost all occupy an "overwhelming injury." Before Spaak came to power, Belgium was a coalition cabinet of the Socialist, Liberal, and Communist parties. At that time, the relationship between the United States and the Soviet Union had not yet become extremely acute, and the Eastern and Western European blocs had not yet been divided too clearly. Therefore, the three parties formed a coalition, and the Catholic Party was excluded from the opposition, becoming the only opposition party. Spaak's rise to power was after the division and confrontation between the Eastern and Western European groups. On the other hand, it also reflected the rightward turn of the Socialist Party in Western Europe, the so-called "Second International" in Western Europe. Therefore, he courted the Catholic Party to join the cabinet, kicked out the Communist Party in the first step, and then excluded the relatively weak "Liberal Party." Relying on the mutual international support of the Socialist Party in Western Europe and Spaak's outstanding talent, he has the means to stabilize the political situation in Belgium. In addition, the industrious character of the Belgian people...</p>
<p>All industrial recovery has exceeded the pre-war state. When I arrived in Brussels in 1945, shortly after the end of the war, I already felt that it was a paradise in Western Europe after the disaster. This time, revisiting, I feel that such a small country with abundant resources and a prosperous people is lovely. Many international businessmen say that Belgium is the richest country in the world besides the United States today. I once mentioned this "overpraise" to Mr. Wass of the Information Office of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. He laughed happily and said: "We dare not say rich, but we dare to boast that Belgium's recovery and construction are rapid. Whatever Belgium had before the war, Belgium has today. The degree of recovery in many industries has long exceeded 100%. Therefore, we have today's superficial prosperity!"</p>

<h3>Ding Xishan's Remnants Caught in Pinghu</h3>
<p>[Report from Pinghu, this newspaper, 21st] In Zhao's teahouse in Changcao, Xincun Town, the county, four bandits with Jiangbei accents and wooden shells suddenly broke into the house on the night of the 19th, robbing more than 3 million French currency, an electric note, and several plain clothes, and fled in the direction of the Shanghai-Hangzhou Highway after the robbery. In addition, the militia of San Ya Township captured three wounded bandits, Chen Yongkang, Cai A'yu, and Hu Xingwang, who all confessed that they were subordinates of Bandit Xishan. The county government transferred them to the Jiaxing Security Command on the 21st.</p>
<h3>New Recruits from Wuxian, Wujiang, and Other Three Counties Gather in Suzhou to be Dispatched</h3>
<p>[Report from Suzhou, this newspaper, 22nd] The new recruits from the first phase of conscription in the three counties of Wuxian, Wujiang, and Changshu under the jurisdiction of the Wuxian Regiment Management District have been gathered in Suzhou and are scheduled to take a car to Xuzhou for training on the morning of the 23rd. Also: The second phase of conscription in this county is about to be implemented. The Shanghai Division Management District stipulated that basic-level personnel in townships and towns did not handle it properly during the first phase of conscription, and all parties had troubles. It is specifically stipulated that it is not allowed to force their way into people's homes and arrest the selected draftees. Those who violate this will be severely punished in accordance with the crime of obstructing military service.</p>
<h3>Early Spring Southern Kapok Red</h3>
<p>[News from Guangzhou, this newspaper, 20th] After the Lunar New Year, the weather has been clear for days, with gentle breezes and bright sunshine, making it a good day for spring outings. The kapok trees, a special product of Guangzhou, have bloomed early due to the particularly warm spring this year. The bright flowers on the trees are blooming red all over Yuexiu Mountain and various parks, embellishing the spring scenery of this southern country and making it more charming. However, in today's high-pressure life, who has the leisure to appreciate it? Although the spring scenery is good, it is only to be disappointed.</p>
<p>A Wave of Inflation</p>
<p>After the "People's Day," everything in the city returned to normal activities, and people were gathering their energy to wait for the good news brought to them by the New Year. Who knew that what came with the spring breeze was a terrible wave of inflation. First, public utilities took the lead: the electricity bill per degree increased from 8,000 to 16,000 yuan, the basic telephone bill increased from 200,000 to 400,000 yuan, and the water bill also increased to 19,000 yuan per mile, an average increase of one time. As a result, general merchants, with the opportunity to take advantage, also raised the prices of goods uniformly. In addition, in recent days, the financial and commodity price fluctuations in Beijing and Shanghai have had an impact, and the market prices of gold and foreign currencies have risen step by step; and daily necessities such as rice, oil, salt, sugar, flour, miscellaneous grains, cotton textiles, and firewood have all skyrocketed. This made the general public, looking back at the increase in commodity price indices last year and looking forward to the days after this year, truly shudder.</p>
<p>Salary Adjustment</p>
<p>This year, people's lives are so difficult, and the government, which is supported by the people, is naturally even poorer. The deficit in Guangdong Province's government expenses is becoming increasingly large and is already an undeniable fact. This time, the central government clearly ordered the adjustment of salaries for civil servants nationwide. Guangzhou is listed as the second district and pays salaries according to 115,000 times the salary. This was originally good news for civil servants, but Guangdong Province's finances are fundamentally unsustainable. The central government can only subsidize 70% of the increased government expenses after the salary adjustment, and the remaining 30% must be raised locally. According to the current income situation in Guangdong Province, although local tax revenue has increased in recent years, the difference is still far away. Therefore, under the principle of increasing revenue and reducing expenditure, the Guangdong Provincial Finance Department is now only actively organizing tidal flats and preparing to open a slaughter tax to increase revenue. Because tidal flats are a very large source of wealth in Guangdong Province, distributed in coastal areas along the river. According to pre-war statistics, there were more than 5 million mu in the province, and tidal flats are formed by alluvial deposits and are newly created every year, so there must be more than this figure now. Unfortunately, they have not been organized for more than ten years, and only 900,000 mu are currently taxed. The remaining 4 million mu have not been taxed. If, after being organized, their ownership is determined, the government's tax revenue will be very considerable. However, these are all future problems. Organizing tidal flats and opening a slaughter tax must go through a period of time before they can be implemented. However, the salary adjustment is a pressing issue that needs to be resolved. Under these circumstances, the provincial government can only take the path of layoffs. The number of layoffs is expected to be 10%, that is, more than 700 people out of more than 7,000 civil servants in the provincial-level agencies. It is said that this method has been decided, and the standard for leaving or staying depends on the merits of the work. Those who are laid off will be given a severance payment of one month to one and a half months and will be introduced to work in various counties. Then, there will be more than 700 more people in the ranks of the unemployed.</p>
<p>Administrative Plan</p>
<p>Chairman Song Ziwen has been in Guangdong for several months since taking office, and on the surface, it is really impossible to see any significant achievements; but he is a pragmatic person who is never willing to pre-issue "blank checks" and would rather announce the facts after they are available. In fact, in these few months, he has deeply understood the actual situation of the place, collected a lot of valuable information, and has a comprehensive plan for the entire political and economic construction of Guangdong Province and South China; this plan can be seen slightly from the declaration jointly issued by him and Mr. Weng Wenhao, Chairman of the Assets Committee. Chairman Song really has superhuman vision. All of his facilities not only stabilize the present, but also look forward to the future and plan for the future; such as building dikes to prevent floods is one example. Last year's floods in Guangdong Province were severe, as everyone in the country knows. Chairman Song first paid attention to this issue at the beginning of his tenure, and soon launched various circles to organize and establish a dyke committee responsible for handling the repair projects of the dykes around the rivers. It started construction in December last year, mobilizing 190,000 civilian workers every day, and is expected to be completed before April of this year, so that the floods in the spring of this year will not flood and cause disaster.</p>
<p>Economic Construction</p>
<p>In terms of food, the authorities also made preparations early; in addition to the fundamental aspect, the government lent a large number of high-quality rice seeds to farmers and guided them to improve cultivation methods to increase production; at the same time, it strengthened the control of food and severely investigated and punished the smuggling of food exports; and in order to meet the needs of the hunger gap, it purchased grain from neighboring provinces such as Hunan and Guangxi before and after, reaching 60,000 dan, and more than 10,000 dan are still on the way. Recently, it has also asked the central government to negotiate with the Siamese government to find ways to help Guangdong with Siamese rice; therefore, it is believed that there will be no grain shortage this spring and summer. In addition, there are various economic construction plans, such as: Wengjiang Hydropower Station, Henan Textile Factory, Qiongya Iron and Steel Factory, Shunde Sugar Factory, and the development of the Ruyuan Baziling Coal Mine, which are all in active progress. In recent days, overseas returnees and some foreign businessmen have had frequent contact with Chairman Song, and they are completely negotiating these issues. Therefore, our vision for the economic construction of South China is infinitely glorious and brilliant; the current obstacle to all this development is the harassment of bandits in various places, which is the most regrettable thing.

<h3>A Conversation with Mayor Zhou Xiangxian by West Lake</h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent Chu Yusheng</p>
<p>[Our Hangzhou Dispatch, 26th] Spring has arrived, and the renowned garden city of Hangzhou is gradually adorning itself with delicate colors, captivating all who see it. The spring season on West Lake this year is expected to be more lively than in previous years, as many have anticipated. Zhou Qiyu, the veteran mayor who has served three terms in Hangzhou, shares this view. He happily told me, "In previous years, only foreigners came to Hangzhou for the Spring Festival. This year, many people from Shanghai are coming to Hangzhou to spend the Spring Festival. I believe this year's spring pilgrimage will far surpass last year's." He also said, "From the time of the Lunar New Year until today, not a single robbery has occurred in Hangzhou. During the Spring Festival, rickshaw pullers, boatmen, and laborers have all earned exceptionally well, which helps stabilize the lower strata of society. If this spring pilgrimage is another prosperous year, then everything in Hangzhou will be stable."</p>
<p>Hangzhou is truly a city that "relies on one spring after three winters." Last year, business conditions were quite good in various places, including Shanghai and Nanjing, so many people will take advantage of this time of renewal to spend money and enjoy the scenery of the lake and mountains, without worrying about anything else. In Hangzhou's taverns and restaurants, it is still possible to order full-course meals, and more lavish options are also available. Compared to Shanghai, it is naturally much more liberal. This is partly because the banquet tax from food establishments accounts for a large portion of the municipal government's revenue. Mayor Zhou also has a theory about this, namely that Hangzhou is a scenic area, and people who come to scenic areas are naturally more likely to sightsee. If sightseers are restricted in their dining options, it will inevitably dampen their spirits. Moreover, Hangzhou's food establishments rely entirely on tourists. If regulations are too strict, the food establishments will not be able to survive. Mayor Zhou told me that thrift is good, but thrift still depends on conscience. If, in terms of dining, one eats a dish and then the plate is taken away only to be replaced by another dish, such thrift is futile. The Pacific Travel Agency has been in contact with the municipal government, willing to undertake the renovation of the famous historical sites around West Lake in Hangzhou, but it wants to place advertisements for major manufacturers. Mayor Zhou told me that assistance to the municipal government in constructing scenic spots is naturally welcome. We will see whether it is effective this year, otherwise, the original agreement will be cancelled. As for the reconstruction of the Leifeng Pagoda, it is not something that can be easily discussed in the short term. According to him, there are more urgent matters than the Leifeng Pagoda, so the reconstruction of the Leifeng Pagoda can only be discussed later."</p>
<p>According to Mayor Zhou, the prices in Hangzhou are still relatively stable, much cheaper than in Shanghai. Some people from Shanghai who ate at Lou Wai Lou once exclaimed how cheap it was, and others who stayed in a high-end hotel for one night also found it very affordable. Therefore, although Hangzhou people "scrape cucumbers" during the spring season, it is still cheaper than in Shanghai at ordinary times. However, with the spring pilgrimage approaching, the Hangzhou municipal government is urgently organizing the repair of various roads and scenic areas. According to Mayor Zhou, all the asphalt roads need to be repaired. Based on last year's experience, 540 barrels of asphalt are needed. Currently, the price of asphalt is 5 million yuan per barrel, so 500 barrels of asphalt will cost 2.5 billion yuan. In addition, painting and renovating the railings of Hubin Park, decorating the front of Zhongshan Park, repairing the Three Pools Mirroring the Moon, and slightly arranging the various scenic spots will cost a total of 5 billion yuan. Although the municipal government does not have money, it is necessary to do this. So, 1 billion was raised to secure the asphalt. The municipal government's financial situation is certainly very difficult. For January and February, they wanted to supplement the new salary standards for their colleagues, but Zhou believed that if they supplemented the new standards, they would have to delay paying the new standards for March, which would only make the colleagues feel more hardship. Therefore, it is better to pay salaries according to the new standards from March onwards, so as not to cause delays. Currently, the Hangzhou municipal government has a total of 320 employees, excluding those in business units. It is said that according to the central system, there should be 520 employees, so the municipal government can avoid being affected by this round of staff reduction in Zhejiang Province.</p>
<p>During my conversation with Mayor Zhou, I asked him whether the merchants who benefit from the flourishing spring pilgrimage could contribute to the scenic areas after the pilgrimage. Zhou shook his head with a smile and said, "Now the currency is devalued, and everything is difficult to handle. Before the war, the municipal government's annual budget was 3 million yuan, and the monthly operating expenses were 150,000 yuan, which was sufficient to cover everything. Now the figures are huge, but there is a sense of neglecting one thing while attending to another. It is really difficult. I think that when the currency stabilizes, the municipal government can carry out a major revival. Under the current circumstances, this is the only way." He felt deeply distressed that Hangzhou's social activities today are not lively enough. In order to ensure that this year's spring pilgrimage is more lively than in previous years, and to prevent the crowds coming to visit and burn incense from becoming too congested, leading to a night spent walking on the streets, sleeping on boats, or lingering on rickshaws as they did last year, Mayor Zhou has ordered all hotels to prepare a large number of canvas beds to accommodate travelers, so that people coming to Hangzhou will not find themselves with money but no place to stay.</p>
<h3>Expansion and Reorganization of Jiangsu Provincial Security Command</h3>
<p>[Our Zhenjiang Dispatch, 22nd] In order to cooperate with the national policies of mobilization and suppression of rebellion, the Jiangsu Provincial Security Command has decided to expand and reorganize its original structure. Chairman Wang will continue to serve as the commander, and the command will have three departments: Staff, Police Security, and News. Except for the head of the Staff Department, whose selection is pending approval from the central government, the Police Security and News Departments will be reorganized from the Fourth Section of the Civil Affairs Department and the expanded Political Department of the command, respectively. The reorganization is expected to be completed by March 1.</p>
<h3>Recent Developments in Shandong Politics</h3>
<p>[Our Jinan Airmail Dispatch, 19th] The military developments of the past six months have caused the Shandong battlefield to gradually fade from the memory of the people. With the National Army's recovery of the Yimeng Mountain area, the stabilization of Jiaodong, the liberation of Yantai, and the successive southward escapes of Liu Bocheng and Chen Yi's main bandit forces to Henan, Hubei, and Anhui, countless people have been shouting, "The Shandong war is nearing its end," and "Shandong has virtually become the rear of the rear!"</p>
<p>This view is based on some factual basis. In particular, the unimpeded passage of the Xuzhou-Jinan section of the Tianjin-Pukou Railway for more than two months has given the people of Qilu, who originally lived in the flames of war, a temporary respite. Those who live in the Northeast and Hebei-Shanxi-Chahar, where the flames of war are still raging, and those who live in Jiangnan, which was originally the most stable but is now approaching the brink of war, will naturally all say in unison, "Shandong has entered a relatively stable period of prosperity!"</p>
<p>In fact, although a part of Chen Yi and Liu Bocheng's main force was defeated in Shandong, their remnants adopted empty-city tactics and quickly fled south. Moreover, due to the tight situation in the Northeast, the National Army, in order to control the Beining Railway, transferred a large army that originally occupied more than one-third of the government-controlled area in Shandong to the south or north before they could completely eliminate the local Eighth Route Army of the Shandong Communists. This objectively gave the Shandong Communists an opportunity to take advantage of. "Wildfires cannot be extinguished; they will spring up again in the spring breeze." The local Eighth Route Army and the regular 2nd, 7th, 9th, and 13th Columns of the Shandong Communists, possessing 96 regiments and occupying an absolute advantage, are once again playing "you come and I go, you go and I come."</p>
<p>As of October last year, when the Shandong war reached its climax, the National Army occupied 67 counties and 3 ordinary cities out of the province's 107 counties and 3 ordinary cities. However, due to the large-scale external transfer of the National Army and the insufficient allocation of troops, non-strategic points had to be abandoned again. Therefore, as of now, only 41 counties and cities remain in the hands of the National Army, and only 14 of these counties and cities are truly under the full control of the government. The rest are still semi-controlled areas and stronghold-controlled areas.</p>
<p>Faced with this riddled situation, Wang Yaowu, the concurrent chairman of Shandong, once personally formulated five key tasks as the guidelines for this year's administration: cultivating cadres, organizing the masses, consolidating local armed forces, eliminating scattered bandits, and increasing production. Regarding the shortcomings of the past local troops, Wang said that the main problems were: "lack of training for cadres," "inadequate training methods," "unreasonable recruitment and compensation system," and "complex and inconsistent organization," which made it difficult to use them flexibly and prevented their strength from being brought into play. Therefore, Wang proposed that this year's reorganization method should focus on the four major goals of "unified organization," "unified treatment," "unified education," and "unified command," and vigorously advocate the spirit of "one person, one gun." He did not adopt the method of formal expansion, but insisted on thoroughly transforming the troops in terms of concepts, awareness, spirit, and substance before they could restore the strength of defending their homes and pacifying the local area.</p>
<p>Whether the Shandong war can truly come to an end depends mainly on the effectiveness of the five key tasks marked by Chairman Wang. In these five key tasks, consolidating local armed forces is the "key of keys," because stability comes first. Without sound and powerful local armed forces, it is impossible to achieve the purpose of stabilizing the local area. (Special Correspondent Li Tian)</p>

<h3>Comparison of Chinese and Japanese Raw Silk Exports</h3>
<p>(Continued from Page 7)</p>
<p>According to statistics from the US Reconstruction Finance Corporation, in March of the 36th year, the US Commercial Company sold 1,525 bales of Japanese raw silk in the US, worth $948,893. Since the US Commercial Company began selling Japanese raw silk in July of the 35th year, it had sold a total of 28,248 bales of Japanese raw silk by the end of March of the 36th year, worth US$27,669,173. As of the end of March, the company had a total of 56,216 bales of Japanese raw silk in stock. As of the end of February, Japan's domestic raw silk inventory available for export totaled 61,407 bales. Comparing these figures with the aforementioned figures for China's raw silk exports to the US in the first eleven months of last year (approximately 11,000 bales), it can be seen that Japanese raw silk still occupies an overwhelming advantage in the US market.</p>
<p>Japan plans to produce 300,000 bales of silk annually for export in the next five years, and its largest customer will undoubtedly be the United States. According to estimates by US silk industry experts, the US raw silk market can absorb 600,000 bales annually in the future. If China can produce 300,000 bales of silk annually for export within five years, it can still compete for half of the US raw silk market. However, as a result of this war of resistance, China's silk industry has suffered enormous losses and is difficult to recover. According to estimates by the China Silk Company, China's wartime silk losses are as follows: A, Silk production losses: (1) Losses in domestic silkworm silk production: 1,603,000 dan. (2) Losses in tussah silk production: 400,000 dan. Total: 2,003,000 dan. B, Equipment losses: (1) 2,600,000 silkworm farming households were damaged, with a total loss of 2,360,000,000 yuan. (2) Seed production decreased by 4,600,000 sheets, with a total loss of 10,900,000 yuan. (3) The silk industry lost 45,000 silk looms, with a total loss of 28,100,000 yuan. (4) Other losses totaled 2,500,000 yuan. Total equipment losses: 300,000,000 yuan (pre-war legal tender value). C, Mulberry garden abandonment losses: (1) 2,180,000 mu of mulberry gardens were abandoned, with a loss of 1,132,000,000 mulberry trees. (2) 5,360,000 mu of mulberry gardens were damaged, requiring the replenishment and renewal of 868,000,000 mulberry trees. The total number of mulberry trees lost was 2,000,000,000. With such huge losses, seeking to restore pre-war production and seeking to increase it has become a major current issue. It is estimated that the silk production in the 37th year will be as follows: Factory silk, spun silk, and native silk in the Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui areas can reach 44,000 piculs. Factory silk, small factory silk, and native silk in the Sichuan and Yunnan areas: 15,000 piculs. Factory silk and native silk in the Guangdong area: 12,000 piculs. Tussah silk: 10,000 dan. Silk from other provinces: 1,400 piculs. The total is approximately 82,400 piculs. Excluding domestic sales, the amount that can be exported is likely to be 55,000 dan, which is also extremely limited. In the future, how to provide technical improvement, business guidance, financial support, and export promotion for China's silk industry all require the concerted efforts of all parties in order to increase production and expand sales channels. Otherwise, it will be difficult to gain a foothold in the competition with Japan for the raw silk market in the future.

<h3>Jixi Asbestos Mine with National Defense Value</h3>
<p>[Our Huizhou Dispatch, 18th] Jixi is located in the heart of southern Anhui and Huining, through which the Huangshan Mountain range passes, and is rich in mineral resources. In addition to gold, tungsten, and silver deposits, it also contains asbestos, which is highly valued throughout the world. The mine was discovered in the early years of the Republic of China. In the 25th year of the Republic of China, the Anhui Construction Department sent mining experts Shen Guozhen and Mai Jianzhi, Dean of the College of Science of Wuhan University, to Jixi for inspection. The results of the inspection showed that the mineral quality was excellent.</p>
<p>Experts value the discovery of the mine. In the 21st year of the Republic of China, villagers near the mine saw piles of rocks in the mountains that were white in color and extremely hard, and thought they could be used to make lime. They took them to burn, but they remained tough and difficult to melt into ash. Therefore, they used the water power of the mountain stream to grind the stones into fine powder in a water mill, mixed it with slaked lime, and used it to plaster walls. Not only was it strong and white, but it was also exceptionally beautiful. Later, it was discovered that it had fireproofing properties. Experts also determined that these rocks were undoubtedly asbestos ore.</p>
<p>In the 23rd year of the Republic of China, a product exhibition was held along the Wuhu-Tunxi Highway in this province. The villagers in the mining area also sent this stone to the exhibition. After experts examined and researched it, they also recognized that this type of asbestos was of excellent quality. For a time, it aroused the attention of the authorities in this province and local merchants.</p>
<p>Large area</p>
<p>The location of the mining area is in Xikengtou, northeast of Jixi County, on Chenggong Mountain and Huanglian Ridge in the Shuishi Village Society. The mining area is full of rocky mountains, and the stones are mostly gray in color. In the middle of the gray stones, there are strips of white stone with very clear textures. This white stone is asbestos. The large stone vein surface of the mining area has overlapping scaly stone flakes as large as rice bowls, like dragon scales. The mining area covers an area of approximately 42 ares, with a thickness of about eight inches.</p>
<p>Heat resistance</p>
<p>Asbestos has great uses, and is most resistant to burning. Even in extremely high heat, it cannot damage its silk filaments. Its only unique effect is to prevent fires. It can be used to make all fire fighting tools. It is the most valuable mineral in science. It is rarely seen in China. Even in all countries of the world, asbestos with national defense characteristics is very important and extremely needed.</p>
<p>Development value</p>
<p>In the 25th year of the Republic of China, Dean Mai of Wuhan University personally visited the mining area and submitted a report to the Construction Department for registration, obtaining a license to mine the mine. Subsequently, Hong Yulin, a Shanghai mining merchant, also submitted an application to the Construction Department to mine the mine. The total area of the asbestos mining area is 42 ares and 25 square meters. However, the mining was suspended due to the outbreak of the War of Resistance Against Japan.</p>
<p>Recently, a businessman in the county, Mr. Hu, intends to develop the valuable resources of his hometown, and plans to unite with farmers in the mining area, collect their own funds, and try to mine it using indigenous methods. It is said that he has consulted with mineralogical experts in Beijing and Shanghai, and this plan is scheduled to be carried out this year. (Special Correspondent Yu Ningpo)</p>

<h3>Fudan Punishes Students for Participating in the Tongji Incident</h3>

Regarding the small number of students from the school who participated in the Tongji University dispute at the end of last month, they did not abide by school rules, but there was no transgressive behavior at the time. Moreover, given that the school is close to Tongji University, it was decided that the participating students may have been motivated by temporary curiosity. Therefore, a severe warning will be given, and they will be observed at all times to see the effect. If there are any further violations of school regulations or actions that harm the reputation of society, heavier penalties will be imposed to maintain school discipline. As for the four students who were present to see them off at the time, Chen Baorong, Guan Baoquan, Tang Huina, and Zhong Zaipu, they had previously violated school rules and had been punished with probation. Chen Baorong should be ordered to suspend school starting from this semester.

<h3>Wusong Fisheries College Adopts New Five-Year System</h3>
<p>New Student Entrance Exam to be Held on the 24th</p>
<p>[Our Dispatch] Before the war, Wusong had a fisheries school, which was founded by Zhang Jian and others during the late Qing Dynasty. After the establishment of the National Government, Cai Yuanpei and others advocated for the establishment of specialized departments such as deep-sea fishing and navigation. Over the decades, it gradually developed into the center of technical talent for China's fishing and navigation industries. Graduates served in regions as far as around the world and enjoyed considerable prestige internationally. The school was destroyed in the war during the Anti-Japanese War, which is a great pity. After the victory, local gentry and various fisheries organizations, joint organizations, Chinese and foreign fisheries experts from the Executive Yuan, and the alumni association of the Wusong Fisheries School, in view of this, repeatedly suggested to the city's Education Bureau to submit the application to the Ministry of Education for approval to restore the school. It was designated as a new five-year college, called "Shanghai Municipal Wusong Fisheries College." Hou Zhaohai, the former principal of Wusong Fisheries School, was appointed as principal and actively prepared for the restoration of the school and recruited well-known domestic fisheries and maritime experts as professors. The training class building of the Fishery Management Office on Fuxing Island in Yangshupu was temporarily borrowed as a school building. At present, various equipment is largely in place, and recruitment of first and second-year students of the fishing major has begun. Those taking the first-year exam must have completed junior high school, and those taking the second-year exam must have completed advanced fisheries or one year of senior high school. In addition to Shanghai, recruitment is also being conducted separately in Qingdao, Taiwan, Guangzhou, Xiamen, and other places. The registration locations in Shanghai are China Fisheries Corporation on East Changzhi Road and Fishery Syndicate on Jiangxi Road. The entrance exam will be held on the 24th of this month at Gezhi High School on Guangxi Road. New students will be exempted from tuition fees, and the remaining fees will be handled in accordance with the regulations for fees at Shanghai's specialized colleges.</p>

<h3>Lu Yinggeng Hosts Banquet to Welcome Catholic Education Representatives and Celebrate Tian Gengxin's Elevation to Cardinal</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] Yesterday was the second anniversary of Cardinal Tian Gengxin's ordination as a cardinal. Lu Yinggeng, president of the Shanghai Catholic Action General Association, hosted a banquet at his private residence last night to celebrate and welcome the representatives of the National Catholic Education Conference. Those in attendance included Cardinal Tian Gengxin, Apostolic Nuncio to China Archbishop Li Peili, Archbishop Yu Bin, Bishop Hui Jiliang, Archbishop Zhao Xinji, Archbishop Mei Zhankui, Archbishop Zhou Jishi, Archbishop Li Lujia, Archbishop Wan Jiulou, and dozens of others. The Lu brothers provided diligent hospitality, and the atmosphere was grand and lively.</p>
<p>Lu's Speech</p>
<p>During the banquet, Lu Yinggeng rose to deliver a welcome speech, which briefly stated: "The First National Catholic Education Conference held in Shanghai is an unprecedented event, and I am extremely pleased. I am hosting a small feast to fulfill my duty as a host and to celebrate the anniversary of Cardinal Tian Gengxin's elevation to the rank of Cardinal by Pope Pius XII in Rome two years ago today. I am honored to have so many distinguished guests present. The ancient scriptures record that Saint Abraham met three travelers on the road one day. Because they were tired from the journey, Saint Abraham welcomed them to his home and treated them sincerely, expressing the affectionate sentiment that 'all within the four seas are brothers.' Unexpectedly, the three travelers were angels sent by God. I am unworthy, but I can only imitate the saint and entertain you priests, who represent Jesus in the world. I am extremely pleased.</p>
<p>Recalling the Past</p>
<p>Recalling that when I was young, my late father, Bo Hong, told me that after the Lu family was converted to Catholicism by Xu Guangqi during the late Ming Dynasty, in the early Qing Dynasty, when Catholicism was not yet developed in China, our ancestors received bishops and priests in their private residences, allowing them to study Chinese literature before sending them to various places to preach and run charitable education in the countryside. There were also Catholic followers who stayed at home to study doctrine and read scriptures. Therefore, the church still allows mass to be held in the chapel in our home to commemorate the occasion, and a special ceremony is held around Easter every year, which I am deeply honored to be a part of. I wish to follow the legacy of my ancestors and am very willing to receive you priests at any time, and I ask for your teachings at any time," etc. After the speech, he raised his glass to celebrate Long live the Pope, Long live President Chiang, Long live Cardinal Tian, Nuncio Li, Archbishop Yu, Bishop Hui, and all the bishops and priests may have good health and flourishing virtues. Finally, Bishop Zhang Weidu of Xinyang, representing the entire group, gave a speech of thanks, praising the late philanthropist Lu Bohong for establishing charitable education and dedicating his life to the church and family. He made many contributions and was deeply admired. Everyone applauded, and the guests and hosts parted in joy.</p>

<h3>Soaring Prices, Sharply Increased Tuition: Xiamen University Students on the Brink of Dropping Out: Request Ministry of Education to Grant Full Public Funding</h3>
<p>[Our Xiamen, 20th Dispatch] Xiamen University students are feeling great difficulty in their lives due to the soaring prices in recent days. Those receiving public funding can make up for it slightly, but the half-public funded and self-funded students, who account for more than half, are largely unable to pay the monthly tuition of 7-8 million yuan and are truly on the verge of dropping out. A group of students from the school recently launched a joint petition to the Ministry of Education requesting full public funding (i.e., changing all students to publicly funded students), which has been supported by more than 400 students. The proposal has also been telegraphed to the school president in Nanjing, urging him to strive for it nearby.

<h3>People's Livelihood Education: Grasping the Historical Center of Gravity: Solving People's Livelihood Problems</h3>
<p>— Wang Yukai</p>
<p>People's livelihood is the center of gravity of history. The rise and fall, order and chaos recorded in history, both ancient and modern, Chinese and foreign, are all reflections of people's livelihood problems. The time of prosperity and governance of a country or dynasty is when its people's livelihood problems are fully resolved. Conversely, the time of decline and chaos is when its people's livelihood problems experience severe panic and social unrest. Successful heroes and wise statesmen all follow this historical iron rule.</p>
<p>How can we determine the center of gravity of history and prevent the country and society from following the wrong path of the past? It depends on education. You can conquer the world on horseback, but you cannot govern the world on horseback. Those who govern the world must use civil rule, that is, education. Therefore, I put forward people's livelihood education to contribute to those who govern the country and bring peace to the world, to help grasp the center of gravity of history.</p>
<p>People's livelihood education is roughly the same as Mr. Du Wei's advocated "life is education." Education cannot be separated from the practical life of the people. In other words, education must help the people seek solutions to their lives. The Principle of People's Livelihood in the Three Principles of the People is based on the idea that people's livelihood is the center of gravity of history and sets out a plan to solve people's livelihood problems, which depends entirely on education to realize it. This is the task of people's livelihood education. Clothing, food, housing, and transportation are the basic elements of people's livelihood problems. Education should impart relevant knowledge and skills to the people in these four areas so that everyone can enjoy their convenience. Taking clothing as an example, from winter fur to summer linen, to winter wool to summer silk, the source and supply of these raw materials raises the two issues of production and transportation. In terms of food, China is based on agriculture, but there is a shortage of food. Since ancient times, people have known that food is the most important thing for the people, but the people's food is worrying, and there are more problems that need to be solved. In terms of housing, from afforestation to construction, are all specialized knowledge, and Chinese housing does not pay attention to environmental design. Since the restoration, the increase in the urban population has made the housing problem serious. How will we solve it? In terms of transportation, if we measure the level of national civilization by the shortness of the roads, then China's transportation requires us to double our efforts to build roads. And the construction problem, the Principle of People's Livelihood has a plan to guide, which requires people's livelihood education to implement it.</p>
<p>We should frankly admit that our education, both in the past and now, has not been able to shoulder the mission of people's livelihood education. Although the purpose of education includes the development of people's livelihood, education and life have still not been able to be coordinated in the past ten years, let alone education is life. Someone said: The difference between Chinese and American education is that Chinese education teaches people things that are not completely needed, while American education teaches people things that are completely needed. Today we should correct this. Education is one of the vital forces of modern countries, and it should not be misunderstood again, let alone be separated from the Principle of People's Livelihood. Mr. Sun Yat-sen's definition of the word "people's livelihood" is: "The people's life, the survival of society, the livelihood of the country, and the life of the masses." But the people's life (clothing, food, housing, and transportation) is the most important, so livelihood, survival, and life are only the enrichment and expansion of life. Therefore, people's livelihood education also focuses on seeking solutions to the people's life. It regards the survival of society, the livelihood of the country, and the lives of the masses as enrichment and expansion of the people's lives. Solving the problem of people's lives will naturally solve the three problems of survival, livelihood, and life.</p>
<p>People's livelihood education is education that uses both hands and brains. Using the brain on one hand and using the hands on the other, there is no distinction between those who labor with their minds and those who labor with their bodies, and there is no distinction between gentlemen and commoners. Only in this way can we achieve equality in education and stabilize the center of gravity of history, without the cycle of prosperity and decline, order and chaos. The people's lives develop upward, enrich, beautify, and bring happiness. People's livelihood education is also living education, doing on one hand and learning on the other, and what we do and learn is what life needs. When we learn agriculture, the farmland is the experimental field. When we learn industry, the factory is the research institute. Living education is also society is school.</p>
<p>Today there are too many problems in education, that is because people's livelihood problems have not been properly resolved. Therefore, everyone has their own opinions and each has their own argument. Those who start from the perspective of occupation advocate vocational education. Those who start from the perspective of production advocate production education. These can all be included in democratic education. Anyone who recognizes that people's livelihood is the center of gravity of history and grasps this center of gravity to seek the country must implement people's livelihood education.</p>
<h3>Hong Kong Side Proposes Five Suggestions for World Cup Football Selection: Rong Qizhao Will Forward to the Sports Association for a Reply</h3>
<p>[Our News Agency] The Hong Kong Branch of the Sports Association has been in a state of disorganization due to previous issues. Since Chen Rongbai, the vice chairman of South China Sports Association, came forward to mediate, after several consultations, the Sports Association branch was finally reorganized, with Cai Huihong as the chairman, Zhong Zhiqiang as the secretary-general, and Lei Ruixiong as the treasurer. The organizational work of the various associations is currently underway separately.</p>
<p>At present, the selection of World Cup football players has been decided to be handled by the Hong Kong Sports Association Branch. Chen Rongbai, due to the heavy workload of the Sports Association, specially invited representatives of all sports associations to a gathering at his residence on the evening of the 16th, on the one hand to discuss how to handle the World Cup selection. On the other hand, it was to celebrate the success. That night, representatives of the 11 basic members of the Sports Association were present (the eleven basic members are South China, Sing Tao, Kwong Wah, Eastern, Kitchee, Chinese, Bus, Chung Mou, Taikoo, Chinese Recreation Club, Youth Society), and Rong Qizhao was also invited.</p>
<p>Hong Kong's Five Points of View</p>
<p>Chen Rongbai gave a speech first: He said that Hong Kong's overseas Chinese sports are developing vigorously, especially football, and should not be restricted by outsiders everywhere. In order to unite and face the outside world, the Sports Association should step up its full cooperation. Then they discussed how to proceed with the selection of players to participate in the World Cup. The Hong Kong Chinese Football Association had submitted five points of view to the Association for reference, and the secretary-general Zhong Zhiqiang read out the five points of view in public. Regarding the inquiries: (1) Guarantee of players' travel expenses. (2) Please announce the selection of the football team leader immediately. (3) How should the family living expenses be handled during the players' departure period. Regarding the two suggestions: (4) The preliminary selection adopts a regional competition system, and the champion team's selection of players must not be less than six people and no more than twelve people. The runner-up team will select from four to nine people, and the third-place team will select from two to six people. The number of people who are not enough will be selected from other teams participating in the preliminary selection. (5) In addition to the original five members of the selection committee, the Hong Kong Sports Association Branch may send two more members, and the Overseas Chinese Association may send two more members.</p>
<p>Rong Qizhao's Reply</p>
<p>After reading, Rong Qizhao replied separately: (1) Regarding the football team's return travel expenses, the government has allocated 150,000 US dollars for the World Cup delegation's expenses, so there is no need to worry about the return travel expenses. (2) I will be responsible for the football team leader, but if there are any talents, I welcome them. (3) Regarding the players' living expenses (referring to family living expenses during the departure period), Rong Qizhao said that it should be handled in accordance with the National Sports Association's amateur rules. Before these rules are changed, I dare not propose other methods. As for the fourth and fifth items, because there are conflicts with what was originally set by the National Sports Advancement Association, I must send a letter to ask for instructions before I can reply.</p>
<p>At this point in the meeting, the Hong Kong Sports Association Branch first discussed how to carry out the work, and resolved: (1) All five suggestions from the Chinese Football Association were accepted. (2) The suggestions will be forwarded to Dr. Rong to be presented to the Association. (3) Regarding the preparations for handling the selection work, South China, Sing Tao, Eastern, China, Kwong Wah, Kitchee, and Bus will each send one representative to discuss the implementation.</p>

As a result of the competition, Hua Lian defeated the Air Force School with a score of 53 to 41.</p>
<p>Principal Hu of the Air Force School performed the opening ceremony, with Shu Hong and Hu Shixuan as referees. As the two teams made contact, the five Hua Lian players responded calmly, while the Air Force School warriors were also cautious. The match was tense and exciting. At the end of the first half, the Air Force School trailed 19 to 25. Switching sides to play again, Chen Xuechong, Wu Chengzhang, Bao Songyuan, and others from Hua Lian displayed even more superb performances. Li Zhenzhong excelled in both offense and defense, while Liao Xuewen from the Air Force School was also exceptionally active. The scores remained close throughout. When the whistle blew to end the game, Hua Lian defeated the Air Force School with a score of 53 to 41.</p>
<p>The Hua Lian visiting team, this morning, accepted the invitation of Mayor Zhou Xiangxian to tour the scenic spots of West Lake and visit the General Labor Union, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, and other organizations. At noon, they had lunch at the auditorium of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce. The entire team is scheduled to take the 6:50 express train back tonight.</p>
<h3>Last Night's Group A Basketball: Ren Gong Defeats U.S. Military Police</h3>

<h3>Great Britain Is Actively Preparing for This Year's Olympic Games: Seventeen Sports, Fifty Countries Participating</h3>
<p>This article is written by Sir Burghley, Chairman of the Organizing Committee of the British Olympic World Games. It is published in The Sunday Times of London. It elaborates on the true meaning of the Olympic World Games and reports on the progress of the preparations for this session. This newspaper has specially translated it here.</p>
<p>At 4:00 PM on July 29th this year, the 14th Olympic Games will be declared open by the British monarch. The international friendship generated by athletic competition is of profound and significant meaning. This torch of amateur sports, before the war, shone brilliantly in all nations. This year's "Olympic Torch" will also, like those of ancient times, use a giant magnifying glass on Mount Olympus in northern Greece to concentrate sunlight to ignite the torch. Then, athletes from various countries will relay the torch, passing it on day and night, regardless of wind or rain. On the afternoon of this historic opening day, the torch will arrive at Wembley Stadium in London and light the sacred flame in the stadium—it will burn day and night throughout the competition period. Countless homing pigeons will rise into the air—in ancient Olympic times, they were used to spread the news of the opening to all regions, and even those at war had to stop. Kipling's "Olympic Hymn," conducted by Sir Malcolm Sargent's orchestra, will be performed by a large choir. Contingents and other teams from various countries will form a historically significant procession. The greatest sporting festival of the era will be declared open.</p>
<p>Within this, one can find genuine hope and evidence that allows one to believe that the world is not necessarily pessimistic. In this arena where humanity connects and works together, there is, in any case, a genuine basis for mutual understanding among the people of the world.</p>
<p>The various preparations for this session are progressing smoothly. Not only has the government provided assistance, but the majority of sports-loving British people have also made every effort to support it. We have invited sixty countries to participate, and fifty have already accepted the invitation. It is estimated that the total number of athletes from various countries attending this session will reach 6,000. They will compete for the highest honor in seventeen categories of sports.</p>
<p>Seventeen Sports</p>
<p>Track and field, as well as the semi-finals and finals of hockey and soccer, will be held at Wembley Stadium. Steeplechase horse racing will be held at Hurst Park, where you can see the world's best horses jumping. Swimming will be held at the Empire Pool, and boxing, fencing, and gymnastics performances will be held near the pool. The Harringay Arena will be the venue for wrestling, weightlifting, and basketball competitions. Cycling competitions will be held at Herne Hill. Rowing will be contested on the Henley River. The Aldershot Ground will be the venue for shooting, equestrian events, and the pentathlon. Torquay will be the location for speedboat racing. Art competitions are planned to be displayed separately at the Victoria and Albert Museum.</p>
<p>The Organizing Committee has been operating regularly for many months, planning how to use the few venues available due to insufficient labor and building materials to hold all the competitions. Fortunately, with the convenience provided by the Air Ministry, the Ministry of Defense, and the Ministry of Labor, housing to accommodate athletes from various countries has now been completed, and the transportation of athletes to and from the venues has also been planned. Along with the athletes, a large number of spectators will come to visit and sightsee in Britain. The work of preparing appropriate lodging for them has been handled directly by the Travel Association of the Ministry of Trade in consultation with the Hotel Industry Association.</p>
<p>I have read in the newspapers the opinions of one or two people who believe that, given the scarcity of resources, it is better to abandon hosting the World Games, since we cannot entertain our guests as we did before the war. From my perspective, these two gentlemen lack an understanding of the intentions of the audience of the Olympic Games. The audience is certainly aware of the various difficulties we have experienced in promoting the work, but they also know that we must do our best to show the traditional spirit of hospitality. According to the reports of representatives from various countries, they are quite satisfied with our hospitality plan. They are especially moved that our country was ultimately able to complete this arduous task in such difficult national circumstances.</p>
<p>All the World Are Brothers</p>
<p>The audience comes from afar, not to find targets for criticism, but inspired by the spirit of "all the world are brothers" and to appreciate the young elites of various countries competing for the honor of world champions. I believe that after returning to their home countries, the audience will take pride in having been guests at this unprecedented sporting event. International amateur sports will undoubtedly become a bridge connecting the nations of the world. It has an important task to rebuild the mutual trust and understanding that is lacking in the world today.</p>
<p>This World Games is not just a few important world championship finals. The true Olympic spirit of international friendship can be summarized by a famous quote from Baron Coubertin: "The important thing is not to win, but to fight well. The main thing is not to conquer, but to participate."</p>
<p>This session of the World Games will be held in this spirit. At this critical moment in world history, it is a great honor for the United Kingdom, the cradle of amateur sports, to be chosen as the host of the Games.</p>

<h3>No Problem with Rice Supply in This City: Full Rationing to be Implemented Next Month; Price Adjustment for Workers, etc., to 800,000 Yuan per Stone</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from This Newspaper] Director Wu Kaixian of the Social Affairs Bureau has returned from attending the five-city rationing conference in Beijing and has been busy planning the preparations for rationing in this city in recent days. According to him, full rationing in this city is scheduled to be implemented starting in March. There is no problem with the rice supply, and various procedures are being actively prepared to avoid delays.</p>
<p>Another dispatch: Mr. Ren Xianqun of the Civil Food Allocation Committee, when attending the tea party hosted by Speaker Pan for district chiefs and district people's representatives yesterday, reported to the district chiefs, etc., on the method of allocating and selling rice and stated that the implementation method was determined by considering the interests of citizens, rice shops, rice merchants, and even transportation personnel. The rice allocation was originally scheduled to begin on March 1, but it may be delayed because the numbering is not completed. If the district offices can assist in the numbering, it can be implemented as scheduled.</p>
<p>Another dispatch: The Civil Food Allocation Committee originally calculated the price of rice for industrial workers at 240,000 yuan per stone, but it has now been adjusted to 800,000 yuan per stone because the difference from the market price is too large. The Allocation Committee has already begun issuing rice for January of this year at two dou per person.</p>
<h3>Price Increases in Chengdu Not Yet Subdued; Provincial Government Issues Four Emergency Measures for Strict Prohibition</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from This Newspaper, Chengdu, 22nd of This Month] The rising prices in Chengdu have not yet been subdued. On the 22nd, the new price of rice was 2,600,000 yuan per double stone. The provincial and municipal governments today issued four emergency measures to strictly prohibit hoarding, report profiteering, dredge grain sources, sell stored grain, and allocate one million stones of overdue grain to prevent rice shortages.</p>
<h3>Wuxi Rice Prices Retreat</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from This Newspaper, Wuxi, 22nd of This Month] The excessively high prices of rice and paddy in Wuxi City have begun to decline. This is mainly because the weather is clear, arrivals are more abundant, and sales are sluggish. White japonica rice outside the market is 2,160,000 to 2,170,000 yuan, early indica rice is 2,035,000 yuan, yuan rice is 965,000 yuan, a decrease of more than 100,000 yuan. Wheat, however, continues to rise, with a price of 2,850,000 to 2,900,000 yuan, with little change. Soybean oil is 5,040,000 yuan, a decrease of 60,000 yuan. Double Fish yarn is 55,600,000 yuan, an increase of more than 1 million yuan.</p>
<h3>Soaring Prices in Guangzhou</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from This Newspaper, Guangzhou, 22nd of This Month] Financial and commodity prices here continue to rise wildly. The Hong Kong dollar has reached an unprecedented record of 430 from 396. General commodity prices have risen again by more than 10%. The market is extremely chaotic, and people are panicked, awaiting effective suppression by the authorities.</p>
<p>The Guangzhou Financial Management Bureau has actively cracked down on the financial black market. On the 21st, it cracked down on two major black market exchange houses and will continue to conduct a comprehensive investigation of the city's banking industry. In addition to the Central Bank raising interbank deposit rates, it has also released a large amount of cotton yarn. However, the city's credit remains very loose and excessive.</p>
<h3>Sharp Price Drop in Baoding</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from This Newspaper, Baoding, 22nd of This Month] Commodity prices in Baoding have been falling sharply in recent days. Grain is being transported from the suburbs, and the Ping-Bao Highway is clear. Coal is also being transported in large quantities. Flour has fallen by 250,000 yuan per bag and is now selling for 1,300,000 yuan. Cloth and daily necessities have also fallen.</p>
<h3>Flower and Yarn Cloth Management Committee Establishes Office in Guangzhou</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from This Newspaper, Guangzhou, 22nd of This Month] The Ministry of Economic Affairs believes that Guangdong and Guangzhou have a great need for yarn and cloth. After the restriction on southward transportation, South China weavers have been greatly affected. In order to develop the South China textile and dyeing industry, the restriction on transportation has been lifted, and a branch office of the Flower and Yarn Cloth Management Committee has been established in Guangzhou, with Lü Gu'er as the director, to manage the transportation of flower and yarn cloth.</p>
<h3>Seized Yarn and Cloth Should Be Returned to Merchants and Citizens</h3>
<p>Shen Shihao Earnestly States Reasons</p>
<p>During the occupation period, the puppet Merchants' Association forcibly purchased yarn and cloth stored by merchants and citizens. Among them, members of the three trade associations of the dyeing and weaving industry, cotton cloth commerce, and cotton yarn commerce were forced to sell more than 200,000 pieces of yarn and cloth. Although the puppet Merchants' Association stipulated that the purchased yarn and cloth would be paid for in gold and cash, the purchase price was vastly different from the market price. Merchants and citizens have suffered greatly. Moreover, after paying part of the gold, the puppet Merchants' Association did not have time to pay the cash before it collapsed with the surrender of the Japanese.</p>
<p>According to Pan Shihao, the chairman of the Dyeing and Weaving Trade Association, "I have been fully promoting the matter of returning the seized yarn and cloth since the victory. I once drafted an article entitled 'Should the Seized Yarn and Cloth Be Returned?' to arouse the attention of the government and the public. However, the government has not taken any active measures, which is regrettable." In terms of legal principles, "all treaties and contracts signed under duress are invalid. The puppet Merchants' Association called it a purchase, but in reality, it was a plunder carried out in a high-handed manner, as everyone knows. After the victory, the government took over the remaining materials of the puppet Merchants' Association. The ownership is very clear. The remaining yarn and cloth should be returned to the affected merchants and citizens, without the need for further explanation," and so on. It is reported that there are more than 10,000 pieces of cotton yarn and 40,000 pieces of cotton cloth, or more than 1,600,000 bolts of cloth, seized.</p>
<h3>Borneo Timber Shipped to Shanghai</h3>
<p>The forests of Sumatra, Borneo, and New Guinea have countless varieties of trees. A few days ago, a batch of Lauan timber from Borneo arrived in this city. The quality is excellent, comparable to Lauan from the Philippines. This cargo was loaded by the Java Shoulin Company, and the Shanghai representative is Shi Shouhou. In terms of transportation, the British Jingyi Timber Company and the Dutch Java Mail Line contributed the most.</p>
<h3>Central Trust Bureau Announces Tung Oil and Bristle Market Conditions</h3>
<p>The Central Trust Bureau reported yesterday on the domestic and foreign tung oil and bristle market conditions this week as follows:</p>
<p>The international tung oil price is sluggish because the U.S. government is investigating the sales situation of Chinese tung oil to the U.S. and has not yet announced the results. Importers and manufacturers are afraid to import goods. Moreover, some importers are trying to take the opportunity to lower prices and profit from it. Our exporters are aware of their tricks and have unanimously decided not to compete for sales to avoid affecting prices. The government is reportedly also planning to take measures to stabilize the international tung oil price in the near future. Therefore, although the tung oil price was once in a precarious situation, it has now turned around slightly. The New York spot price is still US$0.245 per pound. The Hong Kong price is US$0.235 per pound C&amp;F New York. The London price for barrelled oil is £176 per long ton CIF.</p>
<p>Domestic oil prices are 4,000,000 yuan per shi dan in Shanghai, 2,360,000 yuan in Chongqing, 3,420,000 yuan in Hankou, 3,350,000 yuan in Wuzhou, and 3,508,000 yuan in Guangzhou.</p>
<p>The international bristle price is stable. Only Shanghai bristles are slightly softer. Chongqing No. 27 black bristles are priced at US$2.20 per pound CF&amp;New York. Hankou No. 17 black bristles are US$3.05. Shanghai No. 17 black bristles are US$2.10. Tianjin small No. 55 black bristles are US$4.80. There have been some transactions.</p>
<p>Domestic prices for Shanghai bristles are 4,000,000 yuan per guan dan, which is slightly lower than before the Lunar New Year. However, the U.S. dollar exchange rate has risen by 10% on the 20th, so prices are likely to rise slightly. In Chongqing, Hankou, Tianjin, and other places, the market has not fully recovered as the Lunar New Year has just passed.</p>
<h3>Comparison of Chinese and Japanese Raw Silk Exports</h3>
<p>— Chen Quan</p>
<p>Raw silk is a major export commodity of our country. Before 1908, it occupied the leading position in the international raw silk market. At that time, the Japanese silk industry was not yet fully developed. Japanese raw silk began to be sold abroad in 1880. The export quantity in that year was only 8,840 piculs, while China's export quantity was 49,321 piculs. However, the development of the Japanese silk industry gradually became a strong competitor to China's raw silk exports. Since 1909, the export quantity of Japanese raw silk has increased year by year, far exceeding that of our country. Its position in the international market has also become increasingly important, while China has lagged behind. From 1880 to 1946, the lowest amount of raw silk exported from China was 49,321 piculs, and the highest amount was 114,894 piculs; while Japan increased from 8,840 piculs to 351,352 piculs. The speed of its progress makes people feel insignificant in comparison. According to the Shenbao Yearbook, the national raw silk production in China during the 15th and 16th years of the Republic of China was estimated to be about 252,000 guan dan; and the export figures from the 14th to the 18th years of the Republic of China were around 200,000 piculs (including waste silk). Domestic sales were estimated to be 60,000 piculs. Therefore, the national production, including waste silk, should be more than 250,000 piculs. The above estimate of 252,000 guan dan should be calculated excluding waste silk. By the 21st year, the production sharply decreased due to the impact of the silk industry panic. Since then, the export figures have been only about 40% of those from the 17th and 18th years; while Japan's raw silk exports during this period were making rapid progress.</p>
<p>The average quantity of raw silk exported from China in the ten years before the war was more than 70,000 piculs. In the ten years, the highest export quantity was more than 114,000 piculs; the price dropped from more than 2,000 yuan per dan in the 16th and 17th years to more than 700 yuan in the 23rd year. By the eve of the Anti-Japanese War, it rose to more than 1,100 yuan. The ten-year average was 1,638 yuan. The average quantity of waste silk exported in the ten years was more than 61,000 piculs. The highest export quantity in the ten years was more than 96,000 piculs. Compared to raw silk, the difference was only a little more than 10%. The price once dropped from more than 210 yuan per dan in the 18th year to 70 yuan. The ten-year average was 149 yuan. After the war, China's raw silk exports were sluggish due to increased domestic costs and occasional declines in international market prices. In the 35th year, the export of various types of raw silk from China was about 8,500 piculs; the average price was about 3,500,000 yuan per dan. In addition, about 7,500 piculs of waste silk were exported. The average price was about 275,000 yuan. Comparing the export quantity with the pre-war quantity and the pre-war currency value, the extent of its decline can be seen.</p>
<p>As for the exporting countries, the United States ranks first. The United States has a larger consumption of raw silk than other countries. Therefore, if we can grasp the U.S. market, we can be successful in raw silk export trade. However, compared with the past situation of raw silk exports to the United States, it is worrying. In the years from 1926 to 1935, the U.S. raw silk consumption accounted for 15% of the world's raw silk consumption, about 700,000 dan per year. Most of them were Japanese silk, and Chinese raw silk accounted for only a small part. The situation after the war is also not optimistic. The analysis is as follows:</p>
<p>In the period from 1891 to 1941, the proportion of Japanese raw silk exports to the United States in the total amount of raw silk imported by the United States gradually increased, from about 50% to about 90%. The highest amount reached 97% (such as in 1934). After 1921, except for the period from 1921 to 1923, Japanese raw silk sales in the United States accounted for more than 80% of the total amount of raw silk imported by the United States, occupying a very superior position.</p>
<p>During this period, the proportion of Chinese raw silk was always at a disadvantage. Although it reached 25% from 1895 to 1897, it gradually decreased afterward. Since 1931, except for 1940 and 1941, when it exceeded 10%, the remaining years were all below 10%. In 1934 and 1938, it even decreased to 2%. The statistics of raw silk exports from China and Japan to the United States from 1921 to 1941 are listed in the table below. The above is the general situation before the war and in the early stage of the Anti-Japanese War. As for the situation after the war, there are also many concerns. In the past, China's raw silk exports were unable to find a way out due to the oppression of the development of the Japanese silk industry. Domestic people all believed that Japan had suffered war losses after the war and would not be easy to recover for a while. Its silk industry would be no exception. China can take this opportunity to seize the U.S. market and replace Japan's raw silk position. However, the actual situation is just the opposite. According to the U.S. Department of Commerce statistics, in the first eleven months of 1946, China's raw silk exports to the United States were 11,500 bales, about one-seventh of the quantity of Chinese raw silk exported to the United States in the same period of 1939. On the other hand, the Japanese raw silk industry is in a much better situation than China.</p>
<p>After the war, Japan lost its original colonies, so the food needed domestically had to rely on imports from foreign countries, and the quantity was very large. If the food problem cannot be solved, it will be difficult to ensure the stability and security of Japan. The U.S. military authorities stationed in Japan, in order to solve this serious problem, planned to import food and other necessities on behalf of Japan. Therefore, they went on to raise foreign exchange to pay for the import of food. As a result, they adopted a policy of supporting Japanese raw silk exports: and the Japanese raw silk industry, under the maintenance of the occupying authorities, has been flourishing again, and the U.S. market is the main market. As for the mode of operation and export, it is presided over by the Trade Bureau established by the Japanese government, which purchases raw silk from the people in Japanese currency and transfers it to the U.S. occupying authorities. Then, the American Commercial Company affiliated to the American Reconstruction Finance Corporation determines the selling price according to the market situation. For this reason, the selling price of Japanese raw silk in the U.S. market is not related to its production cost. Even if its domestic production cost increases, it will not affect the export of raw silk.</p>

<h3>The Struggle for Uranium</h3>
<p>— Qiang Hua</p>
<p>As everyone knows, uranium is an essential raw material for manufacturing atomic energy. Moreover, in this day and age when atomic bombs are not yet subject to international control, everyone believes that whoever obtains more uranium obtains a greater guarantee of national security. In particular, the United States and the Soviet Union, with their keen sense of security, are engaged in a struggle for uranium.</p>
<p>What is the current situation? To what extent have the two sides progressed? To answer these questions, let us list the world's major uranium-producing areas and point out the state of supply of each uranium mine.</p>
<p>The United States can purchase uranium ore from the following places:</p>
<p>The Belgian Congo produces the most uranium. According to a report by the United Press, geologists estimate that this region contains 70 percent of the world's known uranium reserves. The fact that all of its production is supplied to the United States has become a heated political debate in the Belgian parliament. The Belgian government is unwilling to disclose the total production figures. Recently, the New York Herald Tribune reported that studies from reliable sources show that 2,000 tons of ore sand were produced in 1946, and 1,600 tons were produced in the first three months of 1947.</p>
<p>Communists and leftists in the Belgian parliament claim that the price paid by the United States is "ridiculously" low, and that American uranium ore experts simply treat Belgium as a "colony." Prime Minister Paul-Henri Spaak replied that the wartime agreement with the United States is still in effect and must remain in place until the United Nations decides to abolish it.</p>
<p>The Great Bear Lake area in the Northwest Territories of Canada is the second richest in uranium production. In fact, all of its production is also supplied to the United States. However, the tonnage figures are unknown. Canada retains a small portion of the mined ore sand near Chalk River for its own use in manufacturing atomic energy.</p>
<p>Colorado in the United States proper has recently stepped into a prominent position in uranium production. It is reported that the uranium treasure in this area is so abundant that Americans do not have to rely on foreign sources.</p>
<p>While the United States is concentrating its efforts on buying up uranium mines in every corner of the world, the Soviet Union is also engaged in developing its own domestic treasures. Because the Soviet Union occupies one-sixth of the Earth's land area, the idea that the Soviet Union can produce enough uranium for its own needs is not a problem.</p>
<p>This year, the largest prospecting campaign in Soviet history has begun. According to a Moscow dispatch from the Washington Post, this prospecting work includes 150 aircraft, 3,000 motorcycles, and 6,000 horse-drawn carts engaged in this task. Although the Soviet Union has so far kept the results of the exploration a secret, some facts are already well known. For example, South Turkestan, the Ural Mountains, Lake Baikal in the Far East, and many other places within Soviet territory all have many uranium ore deposits.</p>
<p>A recent United Press dispatch also said that Dr. Bamke, a famous German atomic energy scientist, has agreed to conduct atomic energy research jointly with Dr. Peter Kapitza, a world-renowned Soviet physicist. According to Dr. Bamke, the uranium that the Soviet Union may have obtained from South Turkestan has been used to make several experimental atomic bombs.</p>
<p>In addition, uranium ore is said to have been discovered in Soviet-occupied Europe. For example, some reports say that uranium ore has been discovered in the Erz Mountains, but Dr. Bamke said that the German government also searched for uranium there from 1940 to 1945 without success. However, news continues to spread that this area has been forbidden to enter or leave at will. According to a United Press dispatch, German geologist Dr. Walter Lutz once said that the area contains the only known large uranium deposit in Europe. Other unconfirmed reports say that 100,000 Soviet and German people are engaged in uranium mining along the German-Czech border. The Jachymov mine in the Czech Republic is known for containing abundant uranium. In fact, Madame Curie first discovered uranium by refining it from two tons of pitchblende obtained from this location. The Czech government says that it has no intention of conducting atomic research and that there are currently no mined uranium ores available for export, but the Czech Republic is clearly under Soviet control.</p>
<p>In addition to the United States and the Soviet Union, many neutral countries also have uranium deposits, but the ore deposits cannot yet be sold.</p>
<p>France is one such country. It has uranium ore in its own country and on the island of Madagascar, but its domestic atomic energy researchers are searching throughout French territory. Dr. Kwath, technical director of French atomic energy work, said that 60 to 70 personnel are engaged in this work.</p>
<p>It is widely rumored that Sweden contains a lot of uranium ore, mixed in shale rock. The Swedish government began drilling oil wells domestically during the war due to the interruption of coal and kerosene imports, and it was then that uranium ore was discovered.</p>
<p>In January of last year, Dr. Guotav Egloff, chairman of the Petroleum Division of the American Chemical Society, said upon returning from an inspection in Sweden that their radioactive ore shale contains about 200,000 tons of uranium ore.</p>
<p>Several days later, the authoritative British science journal Nature reported that Sweden had organized a Swedish Atomic Energy Commission and designed a plan for an experimental atomic energy manufacturing plant.</p>
<p>Norway and Argentina have both discovered uranium, and Norway has also established an atomic energy commission.</p>
<p>South Australia is also said to have considerable uranium ore, enough to supply current power for one hundred years.</p>
<p>Mexico, Brazil, New Zealand, and many other countries have all claimed to have discovered uranium ore within their borders. In addition, Travancore, India, is famous for producing thorium. Recently, the United Kingdom and Chile and Argentina fought for sovereignty over the Falkland Islands because of uranium ore.</p>
<p>In the future, the scientific community may find many minerals to be used as raw materials for atomic energy. However, so far, there is only one material in nature that is suitable for this purpose, namely U-235 in uranium. However, U-233 can be extracted from thorium. The main thorium deposit is in France.</p>
<p>This ore in France caused one of the most feared problems for the Allies in World War II because they were deeply afraid that Germany would use it.</p>
<p>It is said that there is uranium ore in Xinjiang, China, and there is also uranium ore in Guangxi, which is being prepared for surveying.</p>
<p>Although this struggle is just beginning, every country knows the value and importance of uranium. The United Nations Atomic Energy Commission has also agreed on the principle of only allowing the use of atomic energy in peacetime, but the struggle for uranium continues unabated.</p>
<h3>The Contribution of Atomic Energy in Peacetime</h3>
<p>— Translated by Qu Sou</p>
<p>Considering the above-mentioned technical and economic points, our conclusion is that the use of atomic energy to generate power can become a secondary source of power in generally industrialized home countries; but even if current fuel prices rise by another 50 percent, uranium will still not become the primary energy source.</p>
<p>Using uranium to generate power will have a great impact on workers, especially coal miners. If current coal prices continue to rise, then some large factories will have to be forced to use uranium as a power source. In this way, general coal mining companies will have to do their best to increase production, and on the other hand, coal can also be converted to other more reasonable uses.</p>
<p>When wages in a certain industry are too high, thereby increasing the price of the product, people will adopt other substitutes or alternative methods that have always been considered too expensive. After the invention of the diesel engine, the electrification of trains was therefore halted. And in the printing industry, every time workers demand wage increases, it promotes a new printing method, such as typesetting machines, automatic typesetting machines, stereotype machines, and faster printing machines. If mankind can have better methods of breaking atoms and better methods of using atomic energy than today, that would be a blessing, because it is a sin for mankind to use coal and oil as fuel now; these two things should be used as raw materials for the chemical industry, not as fuel. From these raw materials, we can manufacture developing chemicals for photography, medicinal drugs for treating diseases, and artificial perfumes, essences, and artificial dyes that can rival natural products; but now these large amounts of raw materials are all burned by us. Only after mankind reaches the age of using atomic energy can we fully utilize these raw materials.</p>
<p>The price of fuel will be the main factor in determining when and where atomic energy plants can be built. Therefore, countries like Brazil will be able to become major powers in the atomic age. Brazil is rich in iron ore sand and manganese, but lacks coal, but has a lot of thorium, which is another radioactive element that can be used to generate power in the same way as uranium. Therefore, Brazil can become a country with a highly developed steel industry. On the other hand, there is very little possibility of using atomic energy on islands in the tropics. Because in this circle near the equator, although fuel is not abundant, there is a lot of sunlight, and using the heat and energy of sunlight is of course the cheapest and most beneficial thing.</p>
<p>Uranium has great explosive power after being impacted, and some people call it atomic explosives. Therefore, people ask whether uranium can be used when excavating canals, digging tunnels, or digging foundations. This is also a question worth considering. What needs the most attention, of course, is radiation.</p>
<p>Using radioactive isotopes, doctors can observe various conditions in living organisms. At the National Institutes of Health in the United States, scientists are now able to attach radioactive metals to bacterial bodies, so they can observe how bacteria fight against antitoxins produced in the body. Tobacco mosaic virus can now be attached firmly for observation purposes, and there is hope that other viruses such as influenza and polio can also do this.</p>
<p>Some radioactive and selective isotopes have been used to treat cancer. After these isotopes are injected into the human body, they will cause the malignant part to glow without affecting the healthy part, and then gradually fade away after several days.</p>
<p>This is not a figment of the imagination or an exaggeration. The University of California in the United States has discovered several elements and compounds with short-term radioactivity that also have the above-mentioned selectivity. Therefore, it is possible to use radioactive calcium to treat cancer.</p>
<p>At the Barnard Free Skin and Cancer Hospital in St. Louis, USA, the use of radioactive elements has enabled doctors to have greater success in treating congestive heart failure. Leukemia, lymphoma, Hodgkin's disease, and various cancers can all be treated with radioactive gold. Radioactive elements can also be attached to red blood cells, passing through the entire human body, allowing doctors to have a deeper understanding of coronary thrombosis. Using radioactive iron can tell us the rate at which red blood cells are produced in a person's body and how the human body absorbs and utilizes iron, so doctors will be more confident in treating anemia. In addition, radioactive elements can be attached to penicillin and other drugs, so soon, the medical community will know how these drugs kill or inhibit germs. In terms of plants, Dr. Bull of Honolulu used radioactive carbon dioxide and learned about the radioactive sugar content in sugarcane.</p>
<p>Some isotopes cannot be obtained in atomic energy plants, so they still have to rely on atomic smashers. But now most isotopes can be obtained in large quantities, so previously only a few scientists could do research in this area, but in the future, a large number of people can study the metabolism and other phenomena in living organisms in biology and physiology.</p>
<p>Therefore, after using atomic energy, we will not have an industrial and social revolution, but may have a great revolution in biology and physiology. Isotopes produced after atomic impact, although have absolutely nothing to do with the process of manufacturing atomic bombs, are the most important research tools discovered by mankind in hundreds of years. In the atomic energy plant, we can also use appropriate buildings to defend against this radioactivity, but if uranium is used to explode in mountains and rocks, then the emitted radioactivity will be attached to the scattered rocks. The land where the first atomic bomb was tested in New Mexico, USA, in 1945 was still radioactive several weeks later; the warships used as targets in Bikini Atoll were still radioactive several months after the test. When we dig a tunnel, using a small amount of uranium may be more effective than using other explosives, but these scattered rocks may not be removed until a year later, so engineers will still use the old methods instead of using uranium. As for the mining of gold, silver, copper and other metal mines, it is even more inappropriate to use atomic energy. It is only on the machines that mine rock mountains that the use of atomic energy is more possible.</p>
<p>Radioactivity is the biggest obstacle preventing mankind from using atomic energy immediately, but it also gives mankind great help. Uranium 235 is no longer uranium after being broken, but produces zinc and Krypton (a rare gas), carbon, or other elements, and these products are radioactive, with a time ranging from several seconds to several months. These radioactive elements are called "isotopes." Isotopes are elements in the same position on the atomic number table, but their actual weight is different from the original elements. The lightest element on the atomic number table is hydrogen, and the heaviest is uranium. There are many variants between them, such as hydrogen has three types, namely hydrogen 1, hydrogen 2, and hydrogen 3. In addition, elements such as lead and carbon also have isotopes. They have different weights and different abilities to carry radioactivity. Isotopes have been obtained in atomic smashers many years before being made into atomic bombs, but the isotopes produced in a pile after being impacted are cheap and have large quantities, so they are excellent sources. For example, if we feed a mouse with fat containing heavy hydrogen, then we can find out which part of its body stores hydrogen and how the body uses it. Fat containing heavy hydrogen weighs differently from fat containing ordinary hydrogen, so it is easy to distinguish. From this method, scientists have discovered that previous human assumptions about how the body consumes fat were wrong. After using nitrogen isotopes as a tracer, we have also gained much knowledge about how the human body absorbs proteins (which contain nitrogen) and turns them into part of the body.</p>
<p>Radioactive isotopes from Oak Ridge have become a very popular gift. Radioactive iodine can treat various disorders of the thyroid gland. Previously, when obtained from atomic smashers, this iodine cost $1,600 per dose, but now it only costs a few dollars from Oak Ridge. Radioactive phosphorus used to cost $2 per unit, but now it only costs 32 cents.</p>
<p>Under the study of radioactive isotopes, medicine, biology, agriculture, physics, and chemistry will all have new developments, and even metallurgy and industry will indirectly benefit and make progress. (Mankind will be able to manufacture metals several times harder than today's metals). Therefore, when discussing the use of atomic energy, the greatest benefits may still be the by-products of smashing atoms.</p>
<p>President Truman of the United States declared at the International Cancer Research Conference that radioactive isotopes will soon be exported from the United States for research by the biological and medical circles of various countries around the world. Although this move has absolutely no impact on the US-Soviet atomic energy control issue, it greatly helps restore the free exchange of scientific knowledge between countries and can break the selfish attitude of self-isolation that has prevailed in the scientific circles of various countries in the past few years.

<h3>Symbol of the New Era Xian</h3>
<p>This great and beautiful mushroom cloud is a long shot taken within three minutes after the second atomic bomb was dropped over Nagasaki, symbolizing the beginning of a new era.</p>
<h3>Sex Determination of Clonal Offspring (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Xie Yiying</p>
<p>(B) Diploid parthenogenesis</p>
<p>Like aphids, rotifers, scale insects, spider mites, stick insects, etc., their eggs that undergo parthenogenesis do not undergo meiosis and generally have diploid chromosome numbers. In detail, the offspring of this type of parthenogenesis have the same number of chromosomes in each cell as the mother, so it is no wonder that they are all female. However, in fact, diploid parthenogenesis does not necessarily all produce female offspring. Some types of animals can produce both female and male offspring, which is truly a miracle of biology. For the sake of explanation and record, let us give examples to illustrate the two categories of diploid female parthenogenesis and diploid dioecious parthenogenesis:</p>
<p>(A) Diploid female parthenogenesis: Some species of animals seem to only undergo parthenogenesis throughout their lives, and their offspring are all female, with no males to be seen. For example, scale insects that parasitize the stems and leaves of plants have a lifestyle that is quite similar to that of aphids. Among them, there are many species that specialize in parthenogenesis to reproduce their offspring. Belloidse in rotifers are all composed of females, and males have not been found to this day. They also specialize in parthenogenesis to reproduce their offspring. Clonopsigalliea, an insect of the order Orthoptera, which is commonly found in Europe, also has only females. Solenobis usually has only females. All such animals that usually only have females produce female offspring as a result of parthenogenesis. The reason for this is that the mature eggs in the mother's body have not undergone meiosis. The offspring have the same amount of chromosomes as the mother, so the offspring that develop should naturally be female.</p>
<p>A more peculiar example is aphids. In the annual life history of aphids, there are generations that engage in parthenogenesis and generations that engage in sexual reproduction. These two generations alternate. Their parthenogenesis can be regarded as a representative of female parthenogenesis, and can also be regarded as a representative of dioecious parthenogenesis. The following is a brief description of their life history in a year:</p>
<p>The aphids found in early spring are all wingless female insects that engage in parthenogenesis (Parthenogenetic female). After the female insects grow up, they immediately engage in parthenogenesis, and produce female offspring by viviparity from eggs that have not undergone meiosis. The female offspring grow up and become mothers, and then engage in parthenogenesis again and give birth to female offspring by viviparity (representing diploid female parthenogenesis). This continues for several generations, until the last generation of mothers in autumn, whose eggs may or may not undergo meiosis, and thus become winged dioecious female insects (Bisexual female). Dioecious female insects do not have both male and female sexes themselves, but rather refer to the fact that the eggs produced by this type of female insect are prepared to be combined with sperm for sexual reproduction. These eggs have all undergone meiosis, so the mature eggs only contain a haploid (n) number of chromosomes. If the eggs of the last generation of mothers in autumn only reduce one or two chromosomes, so that the mature eggs become n-1 (2), then this type of egg will develop into male offspring (representing diploid dioecious parthenogenesis). The germ cells produced by the male offspring, after meiosis, produce two types of sperm, one containing n chromosomes and the other containing n-1 (2) chromosomes. Only sperm containing n chromosomes can combine with eggs. (Sperm containing n-1 (2) will eventually degenerate) to become fertilized eggs to overwinter, and until the next spring, they will develop into mother insects again and engage in parthenogenesis (Note 3). The following is a table of their life history in a year: (See Figure 1)</p>
<p>From the above table, it can be seen that the parthenogenesis of aphids in spring is actually diploid female parthenogenesis, while the parthenogenesis of the last generation after entering autumn is dioecious parthenogenesis. After this generation, it enters the generation of sexual reproduction. The fertilized eggs overwinter until the next spring and develop into mother insects that engage in parthenogenesis again.</p>
<p>The following will further discuss diploid dioecious parthenogenesis.</p>
<p>(b) Diploid dioecious parthenogenesis: In addition to the above-mentioned aphids (Figure 1), the same situation has also been found in grape phylloxera. According to reports by Baehr and Morgan, the reason for the occurrence of dioecious offspring is as follows:</p>
<p>Baehr (1908-1909) studied a species of aphid called Aphis saliceti, and found that cells that develop into females have 6 chromosomes, while cells that develop into males have only 5 chromosomes.</p>
<p>Morgan (1908-1909) also obtained similar facts in his study of a species of grape phylloxera called Phylloxera carydedoauois. Female offspring cells have 6 chromosomes, while male offspring cells have only 5. The parental body of the female grape phylloxera that originally engaged in parthenogenesis does not undergo meiosis when the eggs it produces mature and divide, so the eggs produced for female offspring still have 6 chromosomes. However, the eggs that develop into male offspring are not only slightly smaller in appearance, but also have an X chromosome discharged between the polar body and the egg during maturation and division, resulting in only 5 chromosomes remaining in the egg, so it develops into a male body. This is exactly in line with the principle of X chromosome determining sex. The reproduction cycle and chromosome changes are as follows: (See Figure 2)</p>
<p>In the above table, "A" represents ordinary chromosomes, and X represents sex chromosomes.</p>
<p>(C) Alternately Haploid and Diploid parthenogenesis</p>
<p>Animals like rotifers not only alternate between parthenogenesis and sexual reproduction, but their parthenogenesis is sometimes diploid and sometimes haploid. When the chromosome is diploid, the offspring that develop will be female, and when the chromosome is haploid, the offspring that develop will be male. The parthenogenesis of haploid and diploid chromosomes alternates, so the offspring are either male or female. Rotifers engage in parthenogenesis when the environment is suitable, and the eggs they produce do not undergo meiosis and develop into female offspring. When the environment is suitable, all the eggs produced undergo meiosis, so they only contain half the number of chromosomes. If these eggs are fertilized, they become fertilized eggs containing diploid chromosomes and develop into female rotifers. If the eggs containing half the number of chromosomes develop independently without fertilization, they will all become male rotifers. Because the parthenogenesis of rotifers and other animals has both haploid and diploid types, and it alternates, it can only be listed as a separate category, called alternately haploid and diploid parthenogenesis.

<h3>Sorrow Greater Than a Dead Heart</h3>
<p>— Jingwen</p>
<p>In my previous short essay, "Life and Culture," I only proposed that we should use a new way of life to reform social customs, hoping to enrich the culture of life and give our country and nation new blood and new life. However, it was written too abstractly, and now I want to supplement some meanings.</p>
<p>The decline of social customs and the widespread psychological depression of the people today are undeniable facts. However, opinions on practical matters differ. For example, some people who advocate reforming social customs believe that dancing is a decadent behavior and should be banned. I personally have no opinion on this, because I have no connection with it and am not interested in it. But I think the social issues that deserve attention today are really not trivial issues such as banning dancing or prostitution.</p>
<p>Behaviors like dancing may lead some who are lost in pleasure to a state of spiritual numbness, but dancing itself is not a sinful behavior. What is considered sinful is only the result of an unsound society itself.</p>
<p>As the saying goes, "There is no sorrow greater than a dead heart." I personally believe that the most serious social phenomenon today is the low morale of the people. The biggest sign of this is that there is only self-interest and no sense of right and wrong between people. This manifests itself in selfish, irresponsible, and insatiable greed in life. Countless examples can be cited in the fields of industry, agriculture, commerce, and academia.</p>
<p>For example, education is a sacred cause. In high-level universities in Europe and the United States, it is equivalent to the spiritual fortress of the country and nation. Even small schools in remote areas are the center of the spiritual life of the local people. Schools not only educate students but also guide the people. In the past, our private schools in the countryside could still gain the respect of the villagers, but since the advent of the so-called "school stores," culture has long been swept away, and the relationship between students and schools is only a transactional one. The high cost may be due to the living environment and is still understandable, but what is sad is the lack of qualified teachers and the absence of educational policies. Although there are still many responsible teachers, there are more who are unqualified. What is especially frightening is the decline of the teaching profession. For example, the incident in Nanshi last year in which the principal of a primary school raped an underage female student proves the terrible extent of the decline of the teaching profession.</p>
<p>I will stop here for now. Anyway, what I can see, everyone has already become accustomed to, but what is frightening is precisely that everyone has become accustomed to it, taking it for granted, and is already psychologically numb. The social symptoms of today are precisely in this.</p>
<p>What I said above may be a bit too serious, but it is not to say that it is hopeless, because although the situation is bleak, it is not yet desperate. The treatment methods for mental paralysis by psychiatrists are nothing more than advising patients to change to a fresh environment, and also to take some stimulants. This is the same for social spiritual paralysis. The only difference is that patients with mental paralysis only need to change their environment, while for social spiritual paralysis, it is necessary to create a new living environment.</p>
<p>Although words cannot fully express my meaning, my intention in writing this article is sincere.</p>
<h3>The Lantern Market in Beiping</h3>
<p>— Liu Yansheng</p>
<p>During the Spring Festival, various places traditionally celebrate the New Year by lighting lanterns due to customs. We see in "Water Margin" that when Song Jiang attacked Daming Prefecture, Shi Qian set fire to the Cuiyun Tower. During the Lantern Festival in Daming Prefecture, two mountain-shaped lantern displays were set up, with lanterns lit up at night, fully demonstrating the idea of sharing joy with the people. This is the lantern market.</p>
<p>The lantern markets in various places are not quite the same. Speaking of the Beiping lantern market, it has a long history, and there are written records in various dynasties. To put it briefly, the lantern market started in the Han Dynasty, and flourished in the Ming Dynasty. Liu Tong's "A Brief Account of Objects and Scenery in the Imperial Capital" describes it in detail. Hong Rongzhai's "Rongzhai's Miscellaneous Writings" also has a section on "Lighting Lanterns on the Lantern Festival," explaining that the lantern market originated in the Han Dynasty, and also explaining that since the Song Dynasty, due to various reasons, it was changed to five nights, and later increased to seven nights. Such a comprehensive and detailed seasonal routine event has great folk power. Meng Yuanlao's "Tokyo Dream Record" and Zhou Bida's "Pingyuan Sequel" both describe the origin of the lantern market and the real prosperity of the time. According to records in "Youlan Zhi in Yandu" and "Anecdotes Heard Near the Capital" about the lantern market in Beiping, we can know that the lantern market was originally a prosperous event during the Spring Festival in Beiping, and the location of the lantern market was not the same, not in one place. "Youlan Zhi" says: "The lantern market is located in the east of Wangfu Street, Donghua Gate, and the west of Chongwen Street, spanning more than two li. On both sides are tall buildings, with lanterns lit on them at night, looking like a windy street." According to "Anecdotes Heard Near the Capital": "Every Lantern Festival, on the five nights, in the east of Xima Market and under the Dongsi Archway, there are several lantern sheds, and each store hangs colorful lantern balls, like pearls and jade, like colorful clouds, or interspersed with various colored gauze lanterns. From the lantern market to the east to Dongsi Archway, they are connected continuously. Every time the new moon rises, the street dust does not rise, scholars and women gather, and children cheer." As for the appearance of the lanterns in the lantern market, the "Customs of the Capital" has a detailed record, such as: "The lanterns have various styles, such as large, small, tall, short, long, round, square, etc. There are gauze paper, glass, sheep horn, and Western styles. The painted figures include the states, the Three Kingdoms, Journey to the West, Investiture of the Gods, Water Margin, Strange Tales, etc. The flowers include orchids, chrysanthemums, plums, osmanthus, daylilies, bamboo, peonies, etc. The birds and animals include phoenixes, dragons, tigers, horses, cows, chickens, dogs, fish, shrimps, insects, ants, etc. The colors are bright and beautiful, and the postures are lifelike. There are many varieties, which are difficult to list. The most peculiar are the ice lanterns, which are carved from ice into figures, flowers, birds, insects, fish, etc. The ice is solidified, and it does not melt for a long time. The carvings are exquisite, and the viewers appreciate them." Such ingenious and various lanterns, hung on the streets, are indeed like Bai Juyi's poem, describing "lanterns and lights in every house in the market, singing and music in every building," no wonder "who can sit idly when they see them, where can they hear the lanterns and not come to see them"!</p>
<p>The location of the Beiping lantern market, as mentioned in the "Youlan Zhi in Yandu," is in the east of Wangfu Street, Donghua Gate, Beiping. Chu Baishi's "Renhai Ji" also says it is outside the "Donghua Gate" in the inner city. This place is now "Dengshikou." Although the lantern market has been abandoned for a long time, and the lanterns have been moved to other places, the name of Dengshikou still exists, and it is clear that it was the location of the lantern market in the Ming Dynasty. In the Qing Dynasty, the lantern market was almost moved outside Qianmen. According to "Shuicao Qingxia Lu": "In recent years, the only places with something worth seeing are the major stores outside Qianmen, and the silk and satin shops and ginseng shops on Xiheyan Street, and the Diamochang, and the east and west Jiangmi alleys." This situation still exists every year, but the lanterns are simpler or more elaborate. The existing ones, such as the Three Kingdoms lantern paintings of Ruifuxiang in Dashilan outside Qianmen, the Water Margin of Donghongji and Xihongji, and the lanterns in the various lantern painting shops in Langfang Toutiao, can all attract tourists to stop and watch. The painted figures and landscapes are particularly delicate. Outside Qianmen, there are also the wheat lanterns and ice lanterns displayed in Xiaomen Jiangdian outside Di'anmen, which are also a temporary spectacle. In the early years, when people watched lanterns during the Lantern Festival in Beiping, many jokes were discovered due to the crowds, all made by people in the market taking advantage of the chaos. Since the Republic of China, the lantern market has not been banned, but many items are lost every year, which is a special embellishment of the Spring Festival in Beiping.</p>
<p>This year, due to the price relationship in Beiping, it is probably impossible to see many specially hung lanterns, but only the existing ones are routinely hung to decorate them. If we seek the prosperity of the past, it is no longer possible to get it. The "Shihu Yuefu" has a long poem about the lantern market, with a sentence saying: "Yantai is a prosperous place in ancient and modern times, and I especially love the lantern shadow play on the Lantern Festival. Before spring and after winter, the weather is fine, and the lantern market has already been set up on the street." Such records and descriptions are already historical traces.</p>
<h3>A Sense of Loss</h3>
<p>— Jinjin</p>
<p>The things in the world that can move people are not necessarily the explosion of an atomic bomb, love stories that exhaust all the joys and sorrows of parting and reunion, or unexpected luck such as winning the lottery in a charity house purchase. Sometimes, small details in daily life can also make people feel a sense of loss.</p>
<p>Even now, a vivid picture remains in my mind. It was the morning of the second day after Christmas last year, at most around 6:30 a.m., because I liked to get up early and go out. As I crossed the intersection of Jiangxi Road and Fuzhou Road, I saw a cleaner in red clothes pushing a garbage truck coming towards me. On top of the garbage truck, incongruously lying was a neatly trimmed Christmas tree. The gold-sprinkled paper strips and other decorations were still shining in the dim morning light. But its fate was already to be mixed with garbage and waste. As the saying goes, "When a pearl gets old and yellow, it's worthless." Looking at this Christmas tree, the pearl doesn't need to turn "yellow." As long as its owner has another love, its end is in sight.</p>
<p>Another time, let's go back more than ten years. I was still in middle school. Because I had a habit of getting up early since I was a child, on a certain snowy morning, I went out around six o'clock as well. The street was a white expanse, and the accumulated snow completely covered the asphalt road and the pebble street. Therefore, the footprints left on the snow were particularly distinct, sparse, and it happened to show that someone had walked on this street before me. On such a cold morning, the wind in the face was as sharp as a knife. Who would be willing to leave the warm bed and run around outside? Leaving me aside at the time, it seems quite puzzling except for those who have to run around for food and clothing, but it can just reflect the severity of the pressure of life.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, any occasion that reveals true feelings can arouse our resonance. When we lack this kind of experience in our real life, we can also experience many touching scenes in realistic novels and movies. I think anyone who has read "Les Misérables" must be inspired by the great personality of the protagonist Jean Valjean, who sacrificed himself and dedicated himself to the people. And when a tragedy develops to its climax, at least many female audience members wet their little handkerchiefs. As far as I am concerned, I saw Li Lihua playing the roles of mother and daughter in "Autumn Begonia" a few years ago. After their reunion, the daughter saw her mother coming slowly from a dressing mirror, as if it were an illusion. Another example is in "Waterloo Bridge," when Robert Taylor returned from the war and met Vivien Leigh at the station. At this time, the latter already had an unspeakable sad history. She was full of words, but she didn't know where to start. These two scenes couldn't help but make me feel sad.</p>
<h3>Extraordinary</h3>
<p>— Yun Gong</p>
<p>One of humanity's fundamental desires, according to an analysis by Dr. Ivan, a professor at the University of Southern California, is to be "Above the average." To translate it into a more Chinese way, it is to be "Extraordinary."</p>
<p>It is said that every American wants to be somebody, but in fact, everyone in the world is like this, and the Chinese are no exception. A worker wants to be a "big shot," a store clerk wants to be a "manager," and a college graduate is proud to be able to go abroad for further study. To take a step back, even those great men who claim to be indifferent and retire to the mountains do not want to show that they are different from the "bustling" masses with their leisurely lives?</p>
<h3>Wandering Flowers</h3>
<p>— Chen Shenyan</p>
<p>Chapter Ten: Voluntary Sacrifice (77)</p>
<p>Just as Zhu Zhai was about to get out of bed, Little Wang's mother walked in and said, "Please sleep. It's not the boss who's back." Zhu Zhai asked, "Who is it?" Little Wang's mother said, "It's the milkman." Zhu listened, and lay down again. Little Wang's mother said, "It's getting light. I'm not here. Let her sleep well for a while." She smiled and walked out. Zhu Zhai had spent the night in a daze and had not rested. Now that it was dawn, Qi Wan had no news, and it was useless to worry. As soon as Little Wang's mother left, she covered her head with the quilt. At this time, her mind calmed down a little, and she fell asleep. When she woke up, it was already past nine o'clock. After a hasty snack, she rushed to the bank. At the bank for several hours, she called Little Wang's mother several times to ask if the boss had returned. The other side replied that she hadn't returned yet. Until she got off work in the afternoon, she rushed to Qi Wan's house and saw a cream-colored new car parked outside the door. The driver in the car was wearing a military uniform. She didn't know who had come. She hurried into the door and passed Little Wang's mother, who was holding a washbasin and was about to go upstairs. When she saw Zhu Qi coming in, she nodded and said, "The boss is back." Zhu Zhai was overjoyed and rushed upstairs. Little Wang's mother whispered to stop her, "Don't go up. There are guests upstairs!" Zhu Zhai was stunned and asked, "Who is it?" Little Wang's mother said, "I don't know. It's the boss and him who came together. Wait for him to leave before you go up." Zhu Zhai listened and involuntarily felt a sour feeling from the soles of her feet to the top of her head. Ignoring Little Wang's mother's obstruction, she rushed upstairs and looked out of the guest room. She saw Qi Wan and a military guest sitting on the sofa talking. (End of this chapter)</p>
<p>Chapter Eleven: Full of Doubts</p>
<p>It turned out that Qi Wan and Li Manying had returned from performing in Jinan and Qingdao. Manying introduced her to Chief Miao Zhongjie. After Zhongjie met Qi Wan, he was very enthusiastic and repeatedly wanted to come to Qi Wan's house for entertainment, but Qi Wan refused. Seeing Qi Wan's persistence, Manying sincerely persuaded her several times, saying that Chief Miao Zhongjie was newly arrived from the south and had considerable power in Beiping. She couldn't offend him, and he was very generous. If you could make him happy, you could make a big profit. Because Qi Wan was about to marry Zhu Zhai, she didn't want to associate with him anymore. Although Manying had persuaded her several times, she had never agreed. This day, because her nerves were quite agitated, she wanted to practice her promise to Yu Ru and break off the idea of Zhu Zhai. Only associating with Miao Zhongjie could anger Zhu Zhai and make him break away from the relationship on his own. Qi Wan was in a state of extreme agitation at the time and did not think carefully. After going out, she went straight to Manying to express her meaning. Manying was afraid of offending Zhongjie for this matter. When she heard that Qi Wan was willing to move the wine barrel to learn, she was very happy and quickly called to inform Zhongjie. Zhongjie then invited them to the Liuguo Hotel for dinner. Qi Wan knew that Zhongjie invited her to the Liuguo Hotel with bad intentions, but since she came with the idea of sacrifice, she was not afraid. After arriving at the Liuguo Hotel with Manying, Zhongjie had been paying attention to Qi Wan for a long time. Today, fortunately, he had the opportunity, so he was naturally unwilling to let go and tried his best to be attentive.</p>
<p>From our daily life, the principle of "hope to be extraordinary" dominates everywhere in the invisible. We love to smoke Sanjiu brand cigars or "mild and mellow" cigars worth a dime in U.S. dollars; we love to talk eloquently to show the depth of our knowledge and express our unique insights; we look down on Hollywood's mindless martial arts films and beast films, and even have a contemptuous attitude towards the audience who "only value low-level tastes." If economic ability permits, we naturally like to live in Western-style houses with "coal, electricity, sanitation, and telephone" all available, wearing expensive and well-tailored clothes, and travel by car; and our material desires are likely to be despised by scholars who advocate quietness and inaction. These scholars pride themselves on being "the only ones who are sober when everyone is drunk," "being extraordinary and escaping from the world," or "entering the mud and not being stained." In the final analysis, it may be another subconscious function of praying for "extraordinaryness" that is at work.</p>
<p>People often pursue "outstanding" but cannot get it. If they cannot go through the right path, they have to find another way. This is especially true in the United States, where the curiosity psychology is very strong. For example, an American writer hung a sign on his body that read "Selling U.S. dollars, each dollar sells for only 75 cents." Although it is a loss-making business, it can attract the attention of pedestrians. Another example is when a new film is released in Hollywood, the film company must find a way to have New York reporters interview the protagonist of the film in California from a long-distance call. The conversation is limited to trivial matters such as the weather, but even this long-distance telephone call is enough to cause a sensation.</p>
<p>I also know from some essay-style texts that describe New York life that New York women like to wear rubber "fake breasts." Considering their intention, they are not in seeking "extraordinary" beauty. Whenever I read the above-mentioned examples, I often have an indescribable feeling of humor and sadness mixed together in my heart.</p>
<h3>Remembering Mr. Chu Nanqiang</h3>
<p>— Yu Jianhua</p>
<p>Yesterday I read Ling Xiaohan's "Wuyi Yixing" article, which mentioned Mr. Chu Nanqiang, believing that he deserves to be the strength of the South. I knew Mr. Nanqiang through the introduction of my predecessor, Mr. Jiang Zhuzhuang. At that time, it was around the 20th year of the Republic of China, and Mr. Chu was trying his best to repair the Zhanggong and Shanquan Caves, and specially invited me to visit them in a letter. During my spring vacation, I accompanied my painting disciple Xu Peiji from Wuxi to Yixing, and enjoyed the two caves and other scenic spots. I was treated very kindly by Mr. Nanqiang. Although we communicated several times after we parted, we never had the chance to meet again. During the War of Resistance Against Japan, I heard that he led guerrillas to fight against the enemy. Whenever I met people from Yixing, I would inquire about him, but unfortunately I didn't know the details.</p>
<p>The two caves of Yixing are truly wonders in the southeastern provinces. Zhanggong Cave is divided into front and rear caves, majestic and great, spacious and accommodating. Stone stalactites hang from the top, like the face and crown of a Buddha, solemn and beautiful. Shanquan Cave is divided into upper and lower caves. The upper cave is warm in winter and cool in summer. In winter, warm air fills the cave, and visitors must take off their fur coats when they enter. In summer, the cold air is eerie, and visitors must add clothes when they enter. The colder it is outside the cave, the hotter it is inside the cave, and the hotter it is outside the cave, the colder it is inside the cave. The lower cave is winding and secluded, half land and half water. There are small boats that can pass through it. The stone walls are rugged and the stone stalactites are piled up, presenting various strange shapes.</p>
<p>Since the two caves are famous in the southeast, Mr. Nanqiang believes that to revitalize the commerce of Yixing and prosper the city of Yixing, there is nothing better than repairing the two caves as a slogan. When tourists gather, transportation, commerce, and hotels will be prosperous. Therefore, he spent ten years and exhausted his family fortune to inspect, open up, build, and construct. When his financial resources were insufficient, his daughter-in-law sold her dowry to supplement them. His enthusiasm and perseverance were truly moving, and the name of the two caves became famous as a result. The number of tourists did increase a lot because of this.</p>
<p>Mr. Nanqiang's morality and knowledge have long been admired by his peers. His repair of the two caves was entirely out of a sincere desire to benefit the town. The motive was good, and there was nothing to criticize. However, Mr. Nanqiang's personality was very strong, with a spirit of the foolish old man who moved mountains, but he lacked aesthetic sense. As a result, the natural beauty of the two caves was inevitably damaged, and all the buildings were inevitably ugly and could not match the natural scenery. Although he worked hard, it was half a waste. Many of those who traveled with him had this feeling. However, in view of Mr. Nanqiang's excitement, they did not dare to speak out. After the War of Resistance Against Japan, the situation of the two caves changed a lot. I don't know what they are like now.</p>
<p>Mr. Nanqiang was extremely healthy. Although he was in his sixties, he was still strong and vigorous, with a compelling heroic spirit. The leather shoes he wore had iron plates inlaid on the bottom, each weighing three pounds. Every day he wore these shoes and followed us up and down the mountain caves, walking as fast as flying. His home was inside the North Gate of Yixing. Four old-fashioned red lanterns hung in the living room. Whenever a good guest stopped by and was given preferential treatment, he would shout "Light the red lanterns" as a secret code. When the family heard this, they knew it was an important guest and prepared a sumptuous feast. Otherwise, they knew it was an ordinary guest and served the usual food. In his study, books, calligraphy, paintings, and antiques were arranged almost to the full. The wine utensils carved from bamboo roots that he collected were as many as dozens of kinds. There was an iron lion that was not even a foot long, which Mr. Nanqiang used as a pillow to sleep on for decades. Mr. Nanqiang's calligraphy was peculiar and unrestrained. He liked to write extremely small characters with an extremely large brush, so it was blurred and difficult to recognize. Those who got his letter (he liked to use postcards) often spent several days deciphering it.</p>
<p>I heard that Mr. Nanqiang had the elegant name of "Local Emperor" in Yixing. I don't know if it's true, but I can imagine his hard-working spirit. Recalling his voice and appearance, I can't help but feel regretful.</p>
<h3>Reasons for Divorce</h3>
<p>— Wu Qi</p>
<p>A woman in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, filed for divorce from her husband and won the case. The reason for the divorce was that her husband served in the military during the war with the rank of major. After his discharge, he forced his wife to shout "Major" every time she saw him, and also had to salute.</p>
<p>A woman in Missouri filed for divorce because when she cooked a pot of onion ribs for dinner, her husband always divided the dish into two, eating the ribs himself and telling his wife to eat only the onions.</p>
<p>A woman in Pittsburgh filed for divorce because when she was sick, her husband called the funeral home to send someone to see her and also ordered plain wreaths in advance.</p>
<h3>The Socialization of Universities (Part 2)</h3>
<p>— Wu Geng</p>
<p>In universities around the world today, there are many students, often insufficient classrooms, inadequate equipment, and a lack of teachers, resulting in a situation of too many monks and not enough porridge. Our country is no exception. I humbly suggest: instead of adopting a centralized system, why not switch to a decentralized one? Now that dance halls have already been banned, why not follow the principle of simplification and further utilize tea houses, bookstores, theaters, and the like as educational venues? For instance, Hu Shih could lecture on "Textual Research" at "Seventh Heaven," Feng Youlan could teach "Philosophy" at "Five-Story Building," Wu Jingxiong could lecture on his "Jurisprudence" at "MGM," and Yan Huiqing could recount his "Diplomatic Memoirs" at "Gao Le Bookstore." This way, on the one hand, it solves the problem of venues for scholars to lecture, and on the other hand, it raises the educational level of the general public. People spend their precious time listening to "Pingtan Masters" narrating "The Three Smiles Romance" because they lack better ways to arrange their time. If Yan Huiqing truly recounted his "Diplomatic Memoirs" at a bookstore, people would surely know what's good for them, naturally choosing the latter over the former.</p>
<p>As for the methods of lecturing, one could adopt the "Lecture Style": giving public lectures at a set time. One could also adopt the "Waiting-for-Instruction Style": sitting in a public venue, available for inquiries and discussions from those eager to learn. Or, one could adopt the "Blitz Style": scholars suddenly appearing at a certain dance hall, as the mood strikes them, to give an insightful academic lecture. As for the "tuition fees" as compensation, one could adopt the "Ticket System": specifying a certain ticket price, with attendees entering the venue with a ticket. One could also adopt the "Voluntary Contribution System": if the listener is satisfied, they can give the lecturer a certain amount of legal tender, the amount depending on the listener's financial ability or their level of satisfaction. Or, one could adopt the "Hybrid System": in addition to purchasing a ticket, if the listener feels that a certain scholar's knowledge is truly profound and deep, they may further contribute some funds to support their scholarly pursuits. Such education is truly "Democratic Education." Furthermore, with the state or private individuals establishing more complete libraries and science museums, university education would also be close to</p>
<p>If we manage education in this way, it would be the socialization of "education"; with such a strong academic atmosphere in society, it would be the "universitization" of society. Such university education provides opportunities for people of all walks of life in society, whether they are scholars, farmers, workers, merchants, military personnel, or others, is the first benefit; what people receive is not merely a formal four-year education, but lifelong and endless education at any time, is the second benefit; there are no age or class restrictions, benefiting the rich and poor alike, young and old, is the third benefit; unlike formal education with strict time constraints, people who are already employed can still pursue their careers while also having the opportunity to immerse themselves in an academic atmosphere, is the fourth benefit.</p>
<p>Under today's university education system, students spend four whole years of their precious time on so-called "studying," staking everything on a single bet, which is a great waste. Those who are willing to spend four years at university seriously overestimate the university, which is not as sacred as they imagine. Also, some people believe that they can learn everything they need in four years at university, which underestimates "education" too much; "education" is not that simple. Those who understand this will surely agree with my above-mentioned method of popularizing universities and will not criticize me for being humorous. I hope that righteous gentlemen and social elites will carefully consider my words.</p>
<p>Social Service</p>
<p>United Effort by:</p>
<p>Shen Bao Newspaper and</p>
<p>Renhe Hospital, Baoli Hospital</p>
<p>Red Cross Hospital, Shangxian Women and Children's Hospital, Huisheng Obstetrics Hospital</p>
<p>Jointly Organize Assisted Childbirth</p>
<p>Mr. Jinhua Feng Generously Donates 280 Million Yuan</p>
<p>Hoping Impoverished Pregnant Women Apply Early, Enthusiastic Benefactors Donate Generously</p>
<p>In January, the "Assisted Childbirth for Impoverished Women" campaign helped a total of forty-two impoverished mothers, with twenty-four births at Renhe Hospital, costing over 20 million yuan; twelve at Shangxian Hospital, costing over 30 million yuan; five at Baoli Hospital, costing over 4 million yuan; and one at the Red Cross Hospital, costing over 2.6 million yuan. The total delivery costs for the four hospitals were 57.601 million yuan, and according to the contract, this newspaper should bear half of the delivery costs for the collaborating hospitals, which is 28.8305 million yuan. Compared to the childbirth assistance costs in December, January saw an increase of approximately 200 percent, which is indeed a difficult burden to bear for the "Assisted Childbirth for Impoverished Women" campaign, which relies entirely on reader donations.</p>
<p>However, Mr. Jinhua Feng, with the same generosity as in the past few months, helped us solve this immediate problem. In other words, he independently paid the entire cost, totaling 28.8305 million yuan. We hope that kind people in society will be as benevolent as Mr. Feng, so that the "Assisted Childbirth for Impoverished Women" campaign can expand day by day, benefiting both impoverished pregnant women and the care of infants immeasurably.</p>
