<p>〔本報南京廿三日電〕政院美援運用委會，廿三日下午三時在政院一號官邸邀美國經濟合作總署駐華分署人員舉行第二次聯席談話會，由兼主委翁文灝主持，美援運用委會委員除吳國楨，張嘉璈，貝祖詒未出席外，副主委兪鴻鈞，委員王雲五，兪大維，王世杰，嚴家淦等均出席，糧食部長關吉玉，財次徐柏園等列席參加，美經合駐華分署出席者有賴普漢，吉爾白屈克，史蒂爾曼等數人，會中討論美援運用之政策及細則，美援運用委員會曾就最近在滬成立之美援四小組會對於糧食，棉花，石油，肥料等四項物資運用之意見提出報吿，經熟烈討論四小時，最後雙方均表示同意，惟美方尙須報吿霍夫曼後，始可作最後決定。茲分述美援糧食，棉花，石油，肥料運用之政策如下：（一）糧食，繼續延長美國救濟工作團及政院美國救濟物資處理委會之工作，繼續辦理糧食配售，美援中之糧食全部參加配售之用，同時，糧部亦自籌糧食供應，美援糧食配售時，其價格以接近市價爲原則，仍根據過去採用之辦法，希望切實執行，至貧民無力購買者，將另訂辦法或以半價配售。（二）棉花採取以花易紗，以紗易布原則，以百分之五十在國內市塲銷售，以供民生必需，抑平紗價。以百分之五十在國外市塲銷售，換取外匯，充作購買棉花之用，至運用時之具體辦法，由棉花小組委會再行商討。（三）石油仍交由原管理石油機構處理，分配於經營石油之進口商代售，第七季限額中之石油則予取消，以節省外匯。（四）肥料決定用於換米，換出之肥料，仍須從事增加生產，至換米辦法，則由小組委會再行商定。處理美援物資之小組會，係於上週分別在滬成立，並舉行首次會，均由中美雙方及有關機關人員參加，棉花小組會由沈　瑞召集，糧食小組會由楊綽庵召集，石油小組會由周舜莘召集，肥料小組委會由王念組召集，至工業部份則決定屬於經濟建設專款範圍之內使用。昨日會議中雙方並一致同意，美援之運用以全體中國人民爲對象，並不限於某一都市之少數人民，故糧食配售時，價格將儘量接近市價以大量收回法幣。</p>

<p>社論</p>
<h3 id="c26">從共黨的國際性說起 <a href="#c26" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e26" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">26</a></h3>
<p>最近歐洲共產國際情報局，因爲蘇聯不滿南共政府採取獨立自主的外交政策，乃譴責甫共領袖狄托元帥的違背馬列主義，並決議開除狄托元帥的黨籍，以此號召南國人民反抗其政府更換其領袖。這一事件的發生，不僅可視爲東歐鐵幕的破裂，而且也可目爲共產國際的思想與民族國家觀念根本不能相容的鐵證。世界各國的共產黨是否抱着國際至上主義而毫無民族國家意識，均可以從它對於此一事件的態度表現出來。在鐵幕主人卵翼之下的保，羅，匃，波，捷等國的共產黨，隨聲附和主人的主張，打擊南共及狄托元帥，當爲意料中事；惟中國共產黨對此事件究將作何表示，實爲中外人士所注目。中共究竟有無國家觀念？中共究竟有無民族意識？都可以從中共的聲明中獲得分曉。</p>
<p>「中共中央委員會」遲延了一個星期以後，才於七月十日通過決議，發表聲明「同意共產國際情報局批評南共的決議」。這個決麟雖已經「新華社」廣播，但直到前天，我們才看到這個決議的全文。綜其大意，有下列各點：（一）完全同意歐洲共產國際情報局會議關於南共問題所通過的決議，它的理由是：「舉行這個會議並通過這個決議，乃國際共產主義者爲保衛馬列主義的原則，保衛世界工人階段和各國人民的革命事業所應盡的職責。」（二）嚴詞譴責南共領袖狄托及卡德爾等，說他們「在其對內對外的背叛性的和錯誤的行動，違反了馬克思，列寗主義的基本觀點。」（三）希望南共的國際主義份子能够堅決地起來糾正狄托集團的錯誤，使南共從新走上馬列主義的軌道。（四）認爲南共事件是「階段鬥爭在無產階級革命隊伍中的反映」，中共應當認眞硏究這個決議，「藉以加强然內關於階級的黨的國際主義的自我批評精神和紀律性的敎育」。</p>
<p>過去有許多人士，尤其若干友邦人士，對於中國共產黨的。本質，不免抱着幻想，滿以爲中共也有國家觀念，也有民族意識，不過他們主張土地改革而已；現在看了中共對於南共問題的聲明，應該可以恍然大悟了吧！歐洲共產國際情報局對南共問題的決議，原文甚長，直至七月十二日，始在本報發表，一言以蔽之，這個決議是共產國際底「蘇聯至上」「國際至上」的坦白表示。蘇聯爲什麽不滿意南共領袖狄托元帥所推行的內政外交？推原其故，一因南共在國內參加人民陣綫，以人民陣綫爲國內政治的領導者，而南共並不實行一黨專政，政權大有旁落之勢；同時南共內部隱藏了許多民族主義的份子，均自視甚高，過分誇大自己的力量，認爲即使沒有蘇聯的帮助，也能單獨實行社會主義。二因南共在外交上，對於蘇聯，對於資本主義國家一親同仁，甚至也視「蘇聯爲侵略國」；同時並欲與保國組織巴爾幹聯邦，不惜陣碍蘇聯對巴爾幹半島各國的領導權。</p>
<p>由此可知，蘇南關係的惡化，已由醞釀而至表面化的階段，蘇聯爲本身利益計，不滿狄托元帥之所爲，是勢所必至的事情，蘇聯再進一步，利用歐洲共產國際的勢力，打擊南共，遺責狄托，也是事態發展的必然結果。羅，匃，保，捷等國的共產黨的隋聲附和，足見所謂「口際至上」也者，亦也就是「蘇聯至上」的別名。因此，中共同意八國共黨對南共的決議，並不是中共的忘本，而正是它的本來面目的暴露。從這裏，我們可以獲得許多解釋：</p>
<p>第一，共產黨的特性，並不在於它有一個共產主義，而在它的階級性，鬥爭性，和國際性，尤其是最後的國際性。在馬恩時代，共產黨的國際性，只是指「工人無祖國」而言的。但至蘇聯十月革命後，就變爲「工人有祖國」了，可是這個祖國並非各國工人各自的祖國而是他們的共同祖國「蘇聯」而已。何以見得？去年九月間歐洲共產國際情報局成立時發表宣言，雖也曾强調民族獨立與國家主權，但這一次對南共的決議，却譴責南共實行民族主義，不許其採取獨立自主的外交政策。爲什麽共產黨的國際性這樣前後矛盾？很明顯的，所謂「國際至上」，就是「蘇聯至上」，不效忠蘇聯的，就是揚棄了國際主義，故它們的國際主義，就是以蘇聯爲祖國之別名。這次中共不顧廉恥，甘心爲共產國際的應聲蟲，表示同意歐洲共產國際的決議，並不對於南共事件特別感到興趣，而在表示其「國際至上」，無往而不欲效忠其主子蘇聯，如此而已。美國合衆社最近個　中共將分裂的新聞，謂關內的共產黨可能與東北的共產黨脫　，這種說法，完全是一部分美國人不明瞭中共的特質而引起的錯覺。</p>
<p>第二，本年五月一日，共黨的宣傳機關，在香港一帶，播散「召開新政治協商會議」的流言，若干職業政客，無不喜形於色，爭相走告，以爲共黨將和他們組織「聯合政府」了。但過了幾天，中共的新華社又廣播出毛澤東的一篇演說，强調他的政權，一定要由中共來領導；再過幾天，中共區內只嚷着「人民會議」，對於「新政協」反而一字不提。現在「中共中央委員會」公然贊同歐洲共產國際對南共的譴實，强調階級鬥爭和無產階級對於人民革命事業的領導作用了。沉醉在「聯合政府」的迷夢中的職業政客，看了中共的聲明，大槪可以淸醒了吧！</p>
<p>要之，中共的信奉「國際至上」主義，甘心爲鐵幕主人的奴隸，毫無國家觀念民族意識，在這個聲明裏可以完全看出來了。今日政府正在領導戡亂，戡亂已是當前的國是，做國民的誰也不應該再有所疑，而對於中共更不應再抱着任何幻想，或以在野黨視之，或以普通政黨目之，或以爲中共來了，我們也可以經商營業，甚至也可以聯合參政。美國是一個民主政治先進的國家，對於任何政黨都極尊重，但對於具有國際性而陰爲蘇聯間諜的共產黨，也不以普通政黨待之了。美國共黨領袖十二人的被檢舉，値得我們的警覺與借鏡。</p>
<h3 id="c27">俞交長發表談話　交通事業加價與各綫航機減班　主要原因在於燃料及配件價高 <a href="#c27" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e27" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">27</a></h3>
<p>〔中央社南京廿三日電〕交通部長兪大維，頃就最近交通事業加價及航空公司减少飛行班次事語記者稱：交通原爲服務民衆之事業，非以營利爲目的，最近外界對加價感覺爲數過高，其實若以物價上漲倍數相比，即可了解辦理交通事業者之苦衷；交通目前藉以維持之材料，首要爲燃料及配件，今日煤價爲戰前之二百六十四萬倍，飛機汽油三百一十萬倍，柴油四百二十五萬倍，而鐵路每客公里運價現爲二十一萬六千倍，貨運每公里六十二萬九千倍，平信郵資每封三十萬倍，由此可知實際上交通事業每月虧累之數目殊爲驚人。日前航空公司减少飛行班次，亦即反證現今之價格猶不足維持最低成本，交部昨已派員赴滬調査詳情，將盡力解決渠等之困難，對一切交通事業之運價，交部現正草擬辦法，呈請政院批准，其中主要者仍爲燃料及急需之配件問題，希望能將燃料價格每次固定一相當時期，俾使交通事業價格亦得獲相當時期之安定。兪氏繼稱：交部三年來之工作，向在「搶修華北建設華南」原則下進行，過去如是，今後亦然。華北交通工作人員雖在艱苦環境中，仍有極優良表現，如月前陳毅匪部被驅出隴海綫以北時，數日間隴海路工作人員即將徐州至商邱，開封至鄭州兩段修通。總之，交通人員只要有一分材料，即必盡力到底。</p>

<p>〔中央社成功湖廿二日電〕聯合國總部今日午後微有驚擾，距聯合國辦公大厦三百五十碼之處，突有炸彈一顆爆炸，惟幸無死亡者。據目擊者稱，該彈爲一降落傘炸彈，係由一低飛之訓練機飛過大厦時所投下。按聯合國成立以來，尙係首次發生如此事件。此間治安當局認爲此事純屬玩笑行動，是項炸彈爲郵政機投落郵件時投下作爲信號者。</p>
<p>〔中央社紐約廿三日電〕駕駛小型飛機於聯合國總部上空投下小炸彈者，業經査明，爲一飯店茶房，此人於第二次大戰期中，曾任B19式轟炸機之砲手，現於軍人權利法案訓練計劃規定下學習飛行。自跟長島百英里之遙之康湼狄格駕駛小飛機，飛至聯合國大厦上空投下炸彈。該彈於空中爆炸。聞此人對柏林危機之態度頗爲古怪，渠曾語人謂，此際應有人出頭炸燬聯合國。按聯合國「被炸」已有兩次，前由聯合國辯論聖地糾紛時，曾有一美籍猶太人駕駛單引擎飛機，於聯合國上空散發傳單一萬張，主張聖地分治。以上兩事使若干聯合國工作人員，認爲聯合國於瘋狂者與幻想者之攻擊，缺乏防禦力量，而在此世界危機情形下，此種瘋狂者固大有人在也。</p>

<p>可省即省，硬挺吃素，又落得個夏日節食的好名聲，孰料事與願違，肚子少油水，飯的消耗量却較以往平添一倍。戶口米不够支特，又得請教四千四百萬一祖的黑市米。報上商情表明明判着煤球零售每祖三六〇萬元，可是，當你拿這價錢向煤球店請購時，準會遭到店老闆的白眼，試到第二家問問，夥計們會吿訴你，三六〇萬元的煤球早賣完了，現在有的是五五〇萬元一担的煤球。最沒心肝的是肥皂，只漲不回頭，每塊喊到七十萬，偏又遭逢大熱天，洗了澡來又洗衣，一塊經不起數次用。更可怕是自來水漲，一跳就是兩三倍，普通一戶人家，這一月水難的負祖，平均都在六百萬左右。這就難爲了一般柴米油鹽的小夫妻，一般薪津階級，又獨多先做到月底才拿錢的，更吃虧的是七月份的收入，仍看六月份生活指數計算，一波三折，眼薪津階級祗有坐以待「斃」的份兒了。</p>
<p>看病三次支出千萬</p>
<p>荒年大此皮不說，烟癮發足可眞受不了。看看烟紙店裏五花八門的烟捲，價目也是日日新，又日新。外貨「駱駝」「六根」「馬立斯」，都在百萬關口，就連大英·老刀·克雷斯·白蘭地等也都徘徊在三十萬左右，每天一包二包，又將增加家庭月出的赤字預算。天氣忽冷忽熱，唉晴不定，傷風肚痛，原是流行的小毛病，但要是你熬不過而請敎醫院，一掛號就是百萬金，幾小包藥粉，準要你破鈔三兩百萬，如以看病三次而計算，總支出已破千萬大關。南京路某鞋店，在十天前就以夏季八折大减價爲標榜。當其始也，普通的一雙黑拷花皮鞋，標價八折爲一，三六〇萬元，曾幾何時，巳四島標籤，昨天的價目爲二，五六〇萬元，而八折大减價的標語，仍舊赫然在目。</p>
<p>冰淇淋粉搶購一空</p>
<p>同路上某百貨公司，粗紗運動襪，在上週末標價爲每雙六十萬，大鈔問世後，增爲一一〇萬，短統白羊毛運動襪，本爲每雙三百萬，且僅限於小尺寸，大鈔問世後，增爲六百萬，各種尺寸，變爲一應俱全了。物資供應局的冰淇淋粉，每聽自七五萬陸續遞增至三八四萬，在兩週乎前各承銷商每天還有一百聽應門市供售，但清早開門不及一刻鐘，就遭搶購一空。這批冰淇淋粉，各承銷商早在一週前，就發售一空，聽說物資供應局存貨相當充足，但偏偏在市面急需的時候，中止繼續配售，以致近兩日來冰洪淋粉，每聽已步漲至一千四百萬元，豈不是替黄牛造機會。</p>
<p>有錢的人盡情享受</p>
<p>大公司裏有的是七千萬一件的箭牌襯衫，九千萬一盒廿五枝裝的名貴雪茄，五千五百萬一瓶的三星白蘭地，八千五百萬一瓶的威士忌，十億一襲的西服，六億四千萬一套的十四K派克金筆，四五十億一具的電冰箱，電灶，洗衣機……這一切，在名公互卿看來，祗需有行有市，還不是可以餘錢買得動的。上海本是有錢人的世界，什麼難民的呼籲，什麽公敎人員的哭窮，什麽薪津階級的嘆苦經，有錢的還不是自找姿意享樂，沒錢的命運還不是活該。</p>

<h3 id="c109">興建中的莫干山　是〔桃源〕，却不在〔世外〕　舊的三年計劃已不敷理想 <a href="#c109" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e109" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">109</a></h3>
<p>— 本報記者　黃行天</p>
<p>〔本報杭州廿二日訊〕在炎炎的夏日，英干山的名字又被人們懷　起來，因爲它是代表着淸幽凉爽的避暑勝地，和靑島，牯嶺同樣名聞中外的。莫干山在浙江的武康縣境，是天目山的支脈，平均高度海拔一千八百尺至二千尺，最高峯是拔海二千五百尺的塔山。東可以望錢塘江，北可以見太湖，在歷史上，莫干山之得名，相傳是吳王闠閶，遺干將莫邪夫婦在山上鑄劍，後人爲紀念他們，故以爲名。而莫干山之成爲避暑勝地，那遷遜淸光緒七年以後的事，最初是被幾個打獵的歐美人發現這地方風景幽美，氣候淸凉，是避暑的勝地，因此紛紛向山上天池寺的和尙購山地，建別墅。後來上海的有錢人亦跟踪上山營屋。到民國十七年，張靜江主浙的時候，山上住戶已大有可觀，特設立莫干山管理局爲行政機構。此後逐年繁榮，戰時雖稍有損毁，但不及十一，規模依舊。目前山上有屋二百餘座，夏季流動人口一萬餘人，（臨時上山遊玩者不計），區內經常人口已達四萬人。拾級登山，兩旁修竹茂鬱，山腰白雲片片，直疑山在犬上，而華屋參次，宛若海市蜃樓。這樣一個世外桃源似的境界，難免要爲上海的中西人士趨之若驚，爭往避暑了。</p>
<p>避暑要用美金嗎</p>
<p>事實上，今年到莫干山去避暑的人並不多，這主要的原因是莫干山雖是「桃源」，而不在「世外」，它避免不了物價浪潮的襲擊，許多人傳說上莫干山避暑要用美金計算，住一二就要用上國幣一億，因此把許多人都嚇得裹足不前了。雖然，莫干山確實有以美金論租的洋房，（普通是每幢六百元美金租用一季），有可以讓豪客日耗億元的地方，但這是從奢侈方面着眼。莫干山有日需房金一二千萬的莫干飯店，同時也有一二百萬一天的小旅館和公寓，甚至還有四五十萬元可以度夜的普通飯店底臨時房間。住宿如此，吃飯亦如此。總之，莫干山上的物價，一般的和杭州不相上下。如果作最經濟的打算，你化二千萬元錢，便可在山上過三天淸凉幽靜的生活。目前山上有大小旅館二十餘所，每日可以容納一·二千人，菜館有三家，但主要的營業還是在旅館的飲食部中。</p>
<p>計劃中的新工程</p>
<p>莫干山在抗戰期間，被毀的公私建築，傾圯的水源道路，限於經費的困難，都未能迅速的修好。莫干山管理同爲恢復舊觀，圖謀發展起見，從今年起，已在實施莫干山的復興建設三年計劃。在這個計劃中將做的工程建設計有：（一）道路：自庾村登莫干山的老路，（長一二五一七英尺）全部改以水泥鋪砌重修，整修上山新路（長一九五八〇英尺）路面，並根據自然環境，測定全山之道路系統。（一）電力：設電廠于塔山下，接裝七五匹馬力之柴油發電機二具，用地下電綫接通各用戶。（三）給水，修建原有水源，並在中華山南端計劃大永倉，以解決崗頭路住戶的給水問題。（四）下水道：隨新道路系統，逐步完成下水道系統。（五）公共建築，山中公共建築如禮堂，圖書館，游泳池，球塲等，均已組具規模，擬修復路亭。（六）名勝古蹟：先行興修劍池，蘆花蕩，塔山公園，怪石谷，碧塢，石驚，陟屺亭諸主要風景名勝。此外，更將加强治安警力，種植林木花卉，注意淸潔衛生等。全部計劃，定民國三十九年完成，其經費來源，則全頓復興建設捐。復建捐自今年七月一日起開征預計今年可征七十億，課征對象分二部分，一是業主，照房價五，分六等征取，最高率是房價的千分之廿五，預計可征四十億。一是旅客，照房金征百分之二十，預計可征三十億。但據前征收的情形看來，估計祗征到半數，約三十餘億。不過建設工程還是積極進行，今年部份的計劃，已完成十分之六了。</p>
<p>平民化建設計劃</p>
<p>記者上莫干山的時候，正逢浙江省政府決定擴大莫干山管理局的行政區域，命令武康，吳興，安吉諸有關縣份速辦移交。根據這個新區域，東起武康的三橋埠，南迄武康的小觀橋，西抵武康的武安橋，北達吳興的碧塢，周圍一百二十餘公里內，有高峯山，雙髻山，羊沒山，寨山，山橋埠，石頤山，銅官山，練銅灘，莫嶺，筆架山，疑紫山，仙人灣，六合山，碧塢，天泉山，和睦橋等十六個風景區。其中如原屬吳與的天泉山，佔地四百畝，喬木　陰，流泉淸冽，是遊暑最理想的地方，較莫干山本山更爲可人。因此，新任的莫干山管理局的局長王正誼，深覺這個舊的三年計劃不敷理想，因此，他將另行設計一個通盤的建設計劃來繁榮這個被千萬人懷戀着的避暑勝地。但是更可珍貴的乃是他底另一個雄岡，他將造成莫干山的平民化，把這個避暑勝地從大資產者手里取過來，爲城市中產階級和平民服務。他並不滿意高樓大厦，而頗羡慕日本人在合灣避暑區造的那種簡樸淸麗的小洋房，因此他頗想依照德國人經營靑島的辦法，廉價收買全部山上的土地，然後照計劃有系統地劃成廣可一二畝的無數小塊，以平價賣給人民，這樣不僅建設經費有辦法，而且莫干山的繁榮，也更容易實現了。目前，少數人擁有大量土地，任意抬高地價，使莫干山山地的價格和杭州市區最鬧地區的地價相等，使許多要想上山築屋的人也咋舌裹足了。像這種不合理的現象，在土地公有的計劃下，就不會再現了。</p>
<p>這是一個可愛的遠景，將來我們可以看到上莫干山避暑的不僅是眼前這批囊富美金的俄國人，猶太人，美國人和上海的大商賈，更多的是平民階級的人士，連小公務員和文化人都可以很輕易的上山去避暑，這在今日看來，雖是奢侈的夢幻，但這畢竟不是不可能的計劃，我們希望王局長繼續不斷地向前路邁進！</p>

<p>恒幾米廠經理金震一，他設廠的作風與天豐如同一輙。他本來也是天豐股東，而又是天豐的保人。挪用賦穀共一千四百餘石，金現爲參議員，新近又辦了一個民聲報，縣府處理他的事，十分鄭重，最後也不得不傳押追繳，旋即交保出外料理，不料金保出後，也就逃匿無踪。幾個保人都受了愚，每個保人負責要賠四百石穀子，縣府已一度傳訊保人，保人說出作保經過，歷歷如同騙局，現在騙上了鈎，有苦無無從說，又祗得谷人再找保人。保人保保人，這原是金震一的好戯，金震一自上海寄信他的朋友，說：案子不了，暫時不擬回來！</p>
<h3 id="c112">農業浙江呼聲　進入具體化階段　廿五縣設示範區 <a href="#c112" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e112" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">112</a></h3>
<p>— 本報特派員　儲裕生</p>
<p>〔本報杭州廿二日訊〕最近浙江有一件喜訊，就是聯合國糧食農業組合看中了浙江省，他們協同農林部，省政府預備把浙江建設爲理想的農業示範省。</p>
<p>浙江省，這著名的富庶區域，如果以現時的尺度來評價，她已是在逐漸的衰褪了，因爲現在是科學的時代，其首要當然在工業，而農業也得要利用機械化來生產，這樣才能够得上現代經濟水準，可憐我們的浙江，天賦沒有工業的基礎，——礦藏不多，煤藏尤少。而農業生產，還全衆農胞們胼手眡足一塊土一塊土的耕犂，一顆穀一顆穀的收樓，浙江省的生產方法事實上是千百年前的舊套，她的「富庶」之名，僅僅是承襲着祖上遺留下來的聲譽而已。至於農村副業，著名的絲·茶·也因爲生產方法的不改良，遭受到國外市塲的奚落，成爲沒落中的大門牆。</p>
<p>站在浙江的土地上，我們瞭望浙江的前途，事實上只有振興農業，杭嘉湖的大平原，錢塘江，富春江，浦陽江，曹娥江的可以灌溉遠近豐腴的土地，天然形勢已使她成爲農業的區域，何况又是桑槐處處，茶林綿綿，眞是大好的漁米之鄉！</p>
<p>卅五年時，中美合組農業技術考察團，足跡遍及全國，在他們所訂定的方案中，其中最重要之一點，就是要設一個農業示範區，示範區的地點，竟選中了浙江。兩年來的接洽，已使這示範區達於具體化，於是由農林部長同着聯合國糧食農業組合的重要負責人來杭，訂立更具體的方案。據農業組合裏的一位負責人吿訴記者：他們此來，還帶着看看地方政府到底有沒有決心辦這一樁事業，經過數度接談，覺得滿意，於是商定合組浙江省農業推廣委員會，決定設置委負七人，先以廿五縣爲示範區，由聯合國撥八百六十億，浙省府三百億，農林部一百五十億。我再去問浙省建設廳長貢沛誠，知道示範區的地址已選定在杭·嘉·湖·寗·紹·金華等地區，聯合國的八百六十億即可匯來，匯來後並堅請購置實物，這也已經獲得財廳長陳寳麟的同意。浙省的三百億亦在七月廿二日的省府會議中通過。</p>
<p>他們業務的範圍，第一步是增產，依各種土地的性能，種植各種適合於土地性能的糧食，其他各部門慢慢地再着手做。談到增產，附帶着有很多問題，如水利的興修，農地收穫增値的分配，農民種子資本的貸放等等，按杭·嘉·湖·寗·紹·金華等區，杭·嘉·湖之北有太湖，境內港汶紛歧，是天然的水鄉。寗·紹·區域，境內有曹娥江縱橫其中，尤其寗波復有東錢湖可資灌漑，金華區有浦陽江·金華江環抱，當然比較易收水利之功。不過曹娥江·浦陽江·金華江年來都是小小疏濬，沒有做過鉅大的工程，杭·嘉·湖一帶戽水，都用人力牛力的舊方法，不能節省勞力以利用於別的月途。所以我們要增產，必須詳密考察灌溉水利，該疏濬的應即加疏濬，該改用抽水機的應急加改用，這樣才可把天然的地利形勢，收穫實用之效。</p>
<p>關於農民種子和資本的貸放，我們已聽慣年年政府放得有農貸，而有的農貸發下，已在秋收之時，有的農貸根本沒有到農胞手裏，爲一般變相的假冒農民的組織截留下來做其他的買賣了。在今日的農村中，存留着不少的新土豪，滬些新土豪對政府代表農民要價，而對農民施行壓榨，記者曾走入嘉區農村，他們吿訴我還有借高利貸來耕種的，而還這高利貸的時候却要實物，借一還三，相等於借一個鷄蛋要還一隻鷄的苛刻剝削。所以，我們如果要貸與農民種子與資本，應該如何深入鄕村，挨家訪問，實際貸與，這樣才能把利益眞正的給予農胞們的身上。</p>
<p>農地收獲增値的分配，記者願在這裘特別强調的提出，因爲農地的收穫的分配，往往是地主。佃農和政府，現在農地收穫的增値，自然爲地主們所覬覦。會想盡理由來佔去極大的部份，所以我們在事前，不可不未雨綢繆，免得日後發生糾紛，訊者認爲農業推廣委會，純爲推廣改良性質，希望這次收穫增値，下次更多收穫增値，希望此處收穫增値，他處也要收穫增値，故政府對農民，實含有獎勵增產之意，如果收穫的增値，政府佔了極大部份，則使農民感到白白辛苦，自然反形消極了，所以政府即使要收增値，也應該在百分比中的少數，地主方面，更應無權渦問了，根據孫中山先生民生主義中的平均地權，說明土地的增値與地主絲毫無關，我們今天弄得如此景象，還是因爲偏護地主，沒有眞正的實行民生主義，所以這次糧食增產後收穫的增値，地主應不加分配，這樣佃農或自耕農獲得最大的利益，各地農胞都會紛紛仿效，則不上五六年，浙江的農業，決不會像今天這樣的衰敗情况了。</p>
<p>我們相信浙江省農業推廣委會除了增加生產以外，其他如農村道路的修築，農村生活的改良，農具的改造，當然都會次第進行，我們對這美麗的憧憬，實寄予無窮的期望！</p>

<p>輸管會主委霍寳樹，昨晨自京返滬，當召開會報，首由霍氏報吿政院通過之「僑資及國人在外存款投資生產事業申請輸入辦法」後，幷即交換意見，決定着手擬定施行細則。俟政院命令正式到達時，公佈實行。據記者獲悉，上項辦法之主旨，爲部份開放自備外匯輸入，所有國人在外存款，以銀行證明，係於三十七年六月底前存入者爲限，而僑資則須各當地我領署證明。至於輸入物類，將不限於附表一及附表三，附表二之若干日用必需品與次要品，如米棉肥料等，亦將酌量准予輸入。官方評稱，上項辦法，為補國內物資不足，及撲滅走私黑市，以求穩定物價。對輸入數量與種類，政府仍可絕對控制。至於今後各季限額，幷不因而减少，故無碍正當進口商之利益。而原料輸入增加後，製成品出口可以增加，故認爲上項辦法，絕對有利。</p>

<p>簡史</p>
<p>民國十七年春，潘序倫創立立信會計補習學校，後因鑒於補校辦學方針，偏重解決職業問題，欲負改進會計之使命，非創辦會計專科學校不爲功。乃於二十六年春積極籌設會計專科學校，敦聘陳其朱，王雲五，宋漢章，錢永銘，江恒源及當時立信會計師事務所會計師錢迺徵，李文杰，李鴻壽等組織校董會，籌集基金十七萬元。是年四月校董會正式成立，推定陳其采，王雲五爲正副董事長，潘序倫爲校長。五月校董會呈准敎育部備案，七月又奉准開辦，招生考試甫畢，八一三抗戰開始，校務受阻。其後戰事西移，上海秩序漸平，乃又於二十八年夏奉准招收新生，九月一日新生始業。二十九年三月以基金購置上海徐家匯基地，準備事平之日自建永久校舍。三十年二月奉敎部核准立案，七月第一屆學生畢業。十二月太平洋戰爭爆發，滬市淪陷，翌年秋，遷至四川北碚。三十二年復在重慶市區籌設立信大樓，呈准添設市區班。三十四年八月抗戰勝利，復員返滬。北碚及重慶專科停招新生，辦理至各班畢業爲止。</p>

<h3 id="c150">楊妹案提要 <a href="#c150" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e150" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">150</a></h3>
<p>— 吳庸</p>
<p>楊妹不食奇案開始於本年五月中。筆者愧未能辟穀，該月的舊報紙早已賣了換米，以致確切的日子無從査考。惟據六月一日報載，謂本案「硏究已廿一天」，奇案的開始當在五月九日。筆者素主忠恕之道，抱「大家有飯吃」主義，絕無要求人家餓着肚子以完成私人使命之雄心，故而對此不食奇案初不發生興趣。只是到了六月初，此事似乎驚動了官府，轉入極爲「微妙」的階段，這才爲之肅然，開始仔細研讀各項有關該案的消息。茲特舉其提要，以便後世學者之參考。</p>
<p>據筆者之印象，六月之前不食奇案好像只限於幾位醫生私人方面的所謂「研究」。到了六月二日這才：「楊妹考驗工作決成立『技術委員會』，分『臨床』『硏究』二組，俟衛生局決定各組人選後，楊妹之次步檢驗工作即可進行。」「科學」上的問題用「政治上的手法」來處理，蓋即始於此時。接着各界發表宏論的很多，歸納起來，計分三大類：（一）猜測之詞；（二）主張研究；（三）希望早日獲得結果。對於實地硏究却是不甚感覺興趣。</p>
<p>六月六日報載：「胡文先稱：此神秘不食原因，必須早日覓獲答案，以免混淆社會聽聞。」同日報載：「衛生部對楊妹不食事迄無批示，衛生局頃又將三週來觀察報吿呈衛生部醫政司。」公文於焉開始其旅程。</p>
<p>六月八日報載：該案「轟動全美，美籍專家將飛渝。」</p>
<p>六月十日報載：「張羣對楊妹事垂詢甚詳，亦感重視。楊森並有意向中樞洽撥巨款，籌組硏究機構。」只不知這個籌組中的「機構」是否即係衛生局所主持業已分「臨床」「研究」二組的「技術委員會」？同日報載—「據護士稱：楊妹會放屁。」</p>

<h3 id="c151">論教師檢定 <a href="#c151" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e151" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">151</a></h3>
<p>— 翼君</p>
<p>上海市敎育局又開始舉辦敎師檢定了。首先開始的是國民學校敎師，不久後中學，師範敎師，社會敎育人員，想來也是要舉辦的，這確是一件重要的事情。</p>
<p>一個爲人師者，乃是兒童與靑年，循至一般民衆的楷模，負着培育民族幼苗，啓發民族智慧，改造民族習氣的神聖使命，豈是隨便一個只要有圓顱方趾的人所能充當的？決定一個人有沒有爲人師的資格與條件，關係是非常重大的。所以舉辦敎師檢定，是一件非常必要的事。</p>
<p>但是，這裏有一點（非常重要的一點）特別要指出來的是：「敎育」，並不全等於「敎書」。敎書只是敎育的一部分工作。而過去（今後也許一樣），舉辦敎師檢定時，僅以請求檢定者的學歷與經歷如何爲標準，對於品性修養和體格，則全不過問，這是何等嚴重的錯誤！</p>
<p>實在說來，像這樣子的檢定，不能說是「敎師」檢定，只能說是「敎書匠」檢定。一個人有資格做敎書匠，不一定有資格做敎師。請看那些開學店者，强姦女生者，冒領配給品者，無理取鬧者，豈是「爲人師」的行爲？難道我們的社會還不够糟糕，必須請這等人來「以身作則一乎？</p>
<p>所以今後舉辦敎師檢定時，應該對於請求檢定者的德，智，體各方面，務必都要顧到，一點也含糊不得。</p>
<p>末了，說幾句本題以外的話，即是：舉行敎師暑期講習會時，也不可只注重敎學方法技術的討論，對於品性的陶冶，應當是更重要的一件事情。</p>
<p>「師」，該是一種多麽高潔，正大，而有作爲的人物！</p>

<p>— 丹林</p>
<p>陳少白在國民革命的初期運動，與國父·楊鶴齡·尤列四人，同屬革命同志「四大寇」之一，也是辦理革命宣傳事業最早的一人；民國前十三年，中國日報在香港剏刋，即他所創辦的。</p>
<p>陳在革命運動中，與史堅如烈士的三妹憬然，志同道合，兩人繾綣情愛。關於史女士的生平，陳在「興中會革命史別錄」中，曾有談及，如云：「……而憬然則柔和縝密，聰慧絕倫，尤擅決斷。故堅如有事每商之憬然，古愚（按爲堅如兄）有時不與聞也。時有日人高橋謙者，爲羊城某校敎習，堅如得其介紹，往港見陳某（按即少白），遂入興中會。憬然之於革命，亦爲最熱心之人，第以行動不能自由，乃不克盡行己意，是則謂堅如之入會，即爲憬然之替人，亦無不可。……憬然奉母居澳門，及堅如遇難，憬然忍痛瞞母，凡報紙之記載堅如事者，輒挖去，而僞印不實之事以呈母，許稱堅如避赴小呂宋。……越二年，憬然以戚張竹君女士（按張女士刻尙寓滬）所慫恿，易名至廣州辦女學，未一月，染霍亂，不二日而亡。」</p>
<p>憬然逝世時，年僅廿二歲。陳氏深滿她兄妹的熱忱革命，壯志未酬，先後去世，又念到和憬然已經訂婚，還沒有合巹，兩人遽然中道分離，在公在私，都有無限的悲愴哀感。當史女士的遺骸安葬在廣州市東郊三望崗的敎會公墓的時候，陳氏親自撰寫墓銘勒碑，永留紀念。詞云：「雄心脈脈，寒碑三尺。後死應眉，爾坐爾宅。國魂欲復，哲人不歸。吾族所悲，異族所期。玉已含山，海難爲水。蹇蹇此躬，悠悠知己。天蒼兮地黄，春露兮秋霜；醜虜兮未滅，何以慰吾之國殤！生於一八八一年辛已，終於一九零二年壬寅，共得年二十二。」</p>
<p>此文著壘不多，然而哀感頑艷，情辭悱惻，使人讀了，不禁有兒女英雄的慨想，在革命運動的過程中，這是一段壯烈哀艷的史料。</p>
<p>又馮自由的「中華民國開國前革命史」對於史女士有云；「堅如有妹憬然，熟心革命，不讓乃兄堅如奔走革命，深得其助。一按堅如烈士殉難，是在民國前十一年，過了兩年，憬然女士纔去世。堅如憬然均未婚嫁，古愚在民國後因病瘵亦亡。史母去世最後，享壽九十多歲，歷見骨肉的喪亡離散，始終沒有一些怨懟的話，還以她的兒女沒能够多所供獻國家，引爲歉憾，這是非常難得的賢母，順便的一同談談。</p>

<h3 id="e1">Budget Legislation Completed; Total Amount Over 9 Trillion Yuan; Revenue Portion Increased, Expenditures Slightly Reduced <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 23rd] The central government's general budget for the latter half of the 37th year, the special budget, and its implementing regulations, after three weeks of deliberation by the Legislative Yuan, were completed on the 23rd. It is understood that the revenue portion has been significantly increased compared to the originally listed figures, and the total budget amount has reached a considerable balance, approximately over 9 trillion yuan. The Legislative Yuan held its sixth closed-door meeting on the 23rd to continue discussing the general budget. Four hundred members attended, with President Sun attending and presiding over the meeting despite illness. In the morning, they first discussed the budget report of the Budget Committee, the six small groups, and the Education and Culture Committee, jointly re-examining the budget of the education sector. It was passed with slight revisions based on the original examination opinions. The main points were that after the various subjects of the general budget were transferred to the special budget, the funds less than 15% should be supplemented from the items reduced from other subjects in the second reserve fund of the general budget, and 30% should be allocated to basic education subsidies, 30% to teaching equipment expenses for public and private colleges and universities, 30% to subsidize education expenses in pacification zones, and 10% to revolutionary merit families and war of resistance/pacification merit families education expenses.</p>
<p>The budget for the transportation sector was largely passed according to the examination opinions: (1) The general budget and special budget expenses shall be temporarily approved according to the original plan. (2) The Shanghai Port Reorganization Committee was originally a temporary organization before the establishment of the Port Authority, with a complex system, inconsistent powers, and the original reorganization period had long expired. Although it was approved to continue for another year, it will soon expire. The committee should be terminated immediately, and the Ministry of Transportation should quickly establish the Shanghai Port Authority to take sole responsibility and unify powers. (3) Railway and highway engineering management fees should not exceed 30% of their engineering costs in principle. (4) The various state-owned enterprises under the Ministry of Transportation are large in scale and should be reduced. The personnel treatment is inconsistent. For example, the treatment of personnel in the state-owned China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, China and Central Airlines, the Postal Remittances Bureau, and the Jinghu Railway Bureau is particularly high compared to the treatment of personnel in other state-owned enterprises under the ministry, and should be corrected in accordance with the government's general treatment methods for state-owned enterprise personnel.</p>

<p>The budgets of the social, water conservancy, land administration, food, and health departments were all passed according to the examination opinions. The main points in the budget of the Ministry of Food were: (1) The China Grain Corporation should be abolished, and the accounts should be investigated. The original factories and processing businesses should be properly taken over by the Ministry of Food. (2) The collection operation fee of 500 billion was reduced to 240 billion. (3) The acceptance tool fee of 19.41536 billion was reduced to 9.7 billion. Military grain purchases should be paid at market prices within half a month, and the procurement agencies should be unified to improve the effectiveness of levies and purchases to reduce the burden on the people. (6) In areas where transportation is difficult and rice is not easily transferred, taxes should be levied in legal tender, and the land tax agencies should be simplified. (7) The grain distribution in the five major cities should be half US grain and half domestic grain, and should be extended to other cities as appropriate. In the health department, it was decided that attention should also be paid to the expenses of traditional Chinese medicine in the second half of the year. The budgets of other agencies in charge, such as the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission, the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission, the Resources Commission, the Directorate-General of Budget, and the Ministry of Audit, were all passed according to the examination opinions. In addition, the items listed in the general budget: (1) Debt expenditure, (2) Retirement and compensation expenditure for civil servants, (3) Provincial and municipal subsidies, and (4) The second reserve fund were also passed. As for the construction fee of 3 trillion yuan for the central government civil servant dormitories, it was decided that the Executive Yuan should coordinate the matter instead of allocating it to various agencies to ensure speed and effectiveness. Subsequently, it was decided to incorporate the points for attention on the implementation of the general budget proposed by Jian Gongsan and others into the general report for reference, and the meeting adjourned at half past twelve. The meeting continued at 3:00 PM to discuss the revenue portion of the general budget and the implementing regulations, which were amended and passed according to the examination opinions. Thus, the legislative work of the national general budget and special budget was completed.</p>

<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 23rd] The Legislative Yuan is scheduled to hold the 22nd meeting of the first session on the 24th to discuss important cases that urgently need to be completed through legislative procedures. This meeting is the last plenary session of this session. After the cases listed on the agenda are processed, it will adjourn.

Some members advocated holding the first meeting on September 24, while the Procedure Committee will submit a proposal on the 24th to reconvene on September 18.</p>

<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 23rd] According to the Ministry of Finance: "In the second half of this year, the central government will continue to provide financial subsidies to local governments in accordance with the regulations and the methods of the first half of the year.

<p>[Central News Agency, Fuzhou, 23rd] The Provincial Senate believes that the treatment of Legislative and Supervisory Committee members exceeds that of ordinary civil servants by a significant amount. Considering the current economic downturn and the state's financial difficulties, representatives of the highest public opinion organs should share the difficulties with ordinary civil servants and should not have special privileges, which would increase the burden on the people. The general meeting decided to telegraph the Legislative and Supervisory Yuan, suggesting that the members of the two Yuan should receive the same treatment as ordinary civil servants and should not have special privileges, and telegraphed the senates of all provinces and cities to advocate for a consistent position.</p>

<p>Recommend Convening Provisional National Assembly in Advance</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 23rd] After the budget of the Committee for Mobilization for the Suppression of Rebellion and the budget of the National Assembly member expenses were returned to the Executive Yuan by the Legislative Yuan and not discussed, the National Assembly members in Nanjing, in addition to holding an emergency meeting on the 21st, held a joint meeting in the lounge of the National Assembly Hall at 3:30 PM on the 23rd. More than 300 members in Nanjing attended, chaired by Liu Ziya and Dai Tianqiu, to discuss the issues of convening a provisional National Assembly in advance and amending the constitution. The representatives spoke enthusiastically and emotionally, and many believed that based on the experience of the past few months, the constitution really needed to be amended. They particularly criticized the expenses of the Legislative Yuan members, believing that the Legislative Yuan members' own increase in treatment was unconstitutional. Li Hongru, Hu Zhongwu, Luo Shaowu, and others all made passionate speeches, advocating for the convening of a provisional National Assembly to amend the constitution, but did not advocate for deciding the date. At the time when the debate at the meeting was boiling and there was no consensus, National Assembly member Tian Suixiang overcame all opposition and advocated not to use the convening of the National Assembly as a weapon to scare people in order to achieve the purpose of fighting for treatment. But in the end, it was passed that the members in Nanjing would be the initiators and propose to convene a provisional National Assembly on December 25, 38th year, and organize a preparatory committee for convening a provisional National Assembly in advance. Subsequently, Liu Ziya, Dai Tianqiu, and others proposed to declare the Legislative Yuan members' own increase in treatment as unconstitutional, which was also passed by vote. Dai also advocated the establishment of a committee to investigate the unconstitutional facts of the Legislative Yuan, but it was not established. Before the adjournment, Zhao Xuefeng proposed a motion to ask the President to implement the temporary clauses of the constitution, which was passed by the whole house without objection.</p>

<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 23rd] Legislative Yuan member Lu Yuwen, who strongly opposed the Committee for Mobilization for the Suppression of Rebellion and the National Assembly member expenses in the Legislative Yuan, was accused of corruption at the Liaison Committee of National Assembly Members in Nanjing on the afternoon of the 23rd. The "Henan Representatives Liaison Committee" proposed a motion at the meeting stating that "Legislative Yuan member Lu Yuwen engaged in illegal corruption during his tenure in the Henan Grain Administration Bureau, and the Henan Provincial Temporary Senate proposed to detain him for investigation. The case has not been resolved to this day. It is proposed to collect the facts of the fugitive's old case and send a letter to the Executive Yuan requesting immediate detention and referral to the court for severe punishment in accordance with the law in order to punish corruption and rectify the officialdom." After the committee submitted it for discussion, all the representatives applauded and shouted in unison that there was no objection.</p>

<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 23rd] The Executive Yuan's US Aid Utilization Committee invited personnel from the China branch of the US Economic Cooperation Administration to hold the second joint discussion meeting at the Executive Yuan No. 1 official residence at 3:00 PM on the 23rd. It was presided over by Chairman Weng Wenhao. In addition to Wu Guozhen, Zhang Jia'ao, and Bei Zuyi, the members of the US Aid Utilization Committee, Vice Chairman Yu Hongjun, members Wang Yunwu, Yu Dawei, Wang Shijie, and Yan Jiagan all attended. Minister of Food Guan Jiyu and Deputy Minister of Finance Xu Boyuan attended the meeting. Those present from the US Economic Cooperation Administration China Branch included Lapham, Kilpatrick, Stillman, and others. The meeting discussed the policies and details of US aid utilization. The US Aid Utilization Committee reported on the opinions of the US aid four small groups recently established in Shanghai regarding the utilization of four materials: grain, cotton, petroleum, and fertilizer. After four hours of heated discussion, both parties expressed their agreement. However, the US side still needs to report to Hoffman before a final decision can be made. The policies for the utilization of US aid grain, cotton, petroleum, and fertilizer are described separately as follows: (1) Grain: continue to extend the work of the American Relief Mission and the Executive Yuan's US Aid Material Processing Committee to continue grain distribution. All the grain in US aid will be used for distribution. At the same time, the Ministry of Food will also raise its own grain supply. When distributing US aid grain, the price will be close to the market price in principle, and the past methods will still be used. It is hoped that it will be effectively implemented. For the poor who cannot afford to buy, another method will be formulated or it will be distributed at half price. (2) Cotton: adopt the principle of exchanging cotton for yarn and exchanging yarn for cloth. 50% will be sold in the domestic market to meet people's livelihood needs and stabilize yarn prices. 50% will be sold in the foreign market to exchange for foreign exchange to be used to purchase cotton. The specific method of utilization will be discussed by the Cotton Subcommittee. (3) Petroleum: still be handled by the original petroleum management agency, and distributed to the petroleum importers for sale. The petroleum in the seventh quarter quota will be cancelled to save foreign exchange. (4) Fertilizer: it was decided to use it for exchanging rice. The fertilizer exchanged out must still be used to increase production. The rice exchange method will be determined by the subcommittee. The small groups for processing US aid materials were established in Shanghai last week and held their first meetings. Personnel from both the US and China and relevant agencies participated. The Cotton Subcommittee was convened by Shen Jui, the Grain Subcommittee was convened by Yang Chuo'an, the Petroleum Subcommittee was convened by Zhou Shunxin, and the Fertilizer Subcommittee was convened by Wang Nianzu. It was decided that the industrial part would be used within the scope of the economic construction special funds. At yesterday's meeting, both parties unanimously agreed that the utilization of US aid should be aimed at all Chinese people and not limited to a small number of people in a certain city. Therefore, when distributing grain, the price will be as close as possible to the market price in order to recover a large amount of legal tender.</p>

<p>Construction of Airport and Farmland Irrigation</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tianjin, 23rd] The Tianjin Airport construction plan and the farmland irrigation plan have been drafted and included in the city's urgent needs letter, which will be submitted to Mr. Lapham, director of the China Branch of the US Economic Cooperation Administration, who will be coming here soon, for reference. The airport plans to adopt the International Civil Aviation Organization's B-level standard, and the length of the runway will be about twice as long as the existing Zhangguizhuang Airport runway. There are two sites, one requiring US$17 million and the other requiring US$12 million. The farmland irrigation plan plans to expand the three irrigation canals dug by farmers in eastern Tianjin before the war and add 167 kilometers of new canals. After completion, it can irrigate more than 460,000 mu of good farmland. The total benefit of the annual increase in production, calculated at the prices at the beginning of this month, is approximately US$58 million.</p>
<p>[Our Shenyang Dispatch, 23rd] The Executive Yuan recently replied to the Political Committee stating that transportation in the Northeast is blocked, and it is difficult to transport US relief materials to Shenyang.

<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 23rd] In order to improve the old military school system, the Ministry of National Defense recently drafted an overall reform plan based on the recommendations of the US military advisory group. The main contents of this new system of military education are as follows: (1) The original military schools will be changed to "Army, Navy, and Air Force" officer schools (this is the initial training institution for general military education). Graduates of the school will be allowed to specialize after serving for more than one year. (2) Each branch school, such as armored, infantry, cavalry, artillery, logistics, adjutant, etc., first enters the elementary class, then enters the advanced class. After completing the study period and serving for more than two years, they can enter the staff school again.

<h3 id="e26">Starting From the International Nature of the Communist Party <a href="#e26" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c26" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">26</a></h3>
<p>Recently, the Information Bureau of the Communist International in Europe, dissatisfied with the Yugoslav government's adoption of an independent and autonomous foreign policy, condemned Yugoslav leader Marshal Tito for violating Marxism-Leninism, and resolved to expel Marshal Tito from the party, calling on the Yugoslav people to revolt against their government and replace its leader. The occurrence of this event can not only be seen as a crack in the Iron Curtain of Eastern Europe, but also as ironclad proof that the ideology of the Communist International and the concept of the nation-state are fundamentally incompatible. Whether communist parties in various countries around the world embrace international supremacy and have no sense of the nation-state can be seen from their attitude towards this event. It is to be expected that the communist parties of countries such as Poland, Romania, Hungary, Bulgaria, and Czechoslovakia, under the wings of the master of the Iron Curtain, will echo the master's claims and attack the Yugoslav Communist Party and Marshal Tito; however, the attitude of the Chinese Communist Party toward this event is drawing attention from both domestic and foreign observers. Does the CCP have a concept of the state? Does the CCP have a sense of nationhood? The answers can all be gleaned from the CCP's statement.</p>
<p>After a week's delay, the "Central Committee of the CCP" finally passed a resolution on July 10, issuing a statement "agreeing with the resolution of the Information Bureau of the Communist International in Europe criticizing the Yugoslav Communist Party." Although this resolution has already been broadcast by "Xinhua News Agency," we only saw the full text of the resolution the day before yesterday. In general, it contains the following points: (1) Fully agree with the resolution passed by the conference of the Information Bureau of the Communist International in Europe on the Yugoslav Communist Party issue. The reason is that "holding this conference and passing this resolution is the duty of international communists to defend the principles of Marxism-Leninism and the revolutionary cause of the working class and the people of all countries." (2) Sternly condemn Yugoslav leaders Tito and Kardelj, saying that "in their treacherous and erroneous actions, both internally and externally, they violated the basic tenets of Marx and Lenin." (3) Hope that internationalist elements in the Yugoslav Communist Party can resolutely rise up to correct the mistakes of the Tito clique and bring the Yugoslav Communist Party back on the path of Marxism-Leninism. (4) Believe that the Yugoslav Communist Party incident is "a reflection of the class struggle within the ranks of the proletarian revolution," and the CCP should seriously study this resolution "to strengthen education within the party regarding class, internationalism, self-criticism, and discipline."</p>
<p>In the past, many people, especially some friendly foreigners, inevitably held illusions about the essence of the Chinese Communist Party, thinking that the CCP also had a concept of the state and a sense of nationhood, but that they simply advocated land reform; now, after reading the CCP's statement on the Yugoslav Communist Party issue, they should be able to suddenly realize the truth! The original text of the resolution of the Information Bureau of the Communist International in Europe on the Yugoslav Communist Party issue was quite long, and it was only published in this newspaper on July 12. In a nutshell, this resolution is a frank expression of the Communist International's "Soviet Supremacy" and "International Supremacy". Why is the Soviet Union dissatisfied with the domestic and foreign policies pursued by Yugoslav leader Marshal Tito? The underlying reasons are: firstly, that the Yugoslav Communist Party participates in the People's Front domestically, with the People's Front leading domestic politics, and the Yugoslav Communist Party does not practice one-party dictatorship, with the potential for power to fall into other hands; at the same time, many nationalist elements are hidden within the Yugoslav Communist Party, who regard themselves very highly, exaggerate their own strength, and believe that they can implement socialism independently even without Soviet help. Secondly, in foreign policy, the Yugoslav Communist Party treats the Soviet Union and capitalist countries equally, and even regards the "Soviet Union as an aggressor"; at the same time, it also wants to organize a Balkan Federation with Bulgaria, not hesitating to hinder the Soviet Union's leadership over the countries of the Balkan Peninsula.</p>
<p>From this, it can be seen that the deterioration of Soviet-Yugoslav relations has progressed from the incubation stage to the surface stage. The Soviet Union, for its own interests, is dissatisfied with Marshal Tito's actions, which is inevitable. The Soviet Union went a step further, using the power of the European Communist International to attack the Yugoslav Communist Party and criticize Tito, which was also an inevitable result of the development of the situation. The echoing of the communist parties of Romania, Hungary, Bulgaria, and Czechoslovakia shows that so-called "International Supremacy" is also another name for "Soviet Supremacy." Therefore, the CCP's agreement with the resolutions of the eight communist parties on the Yugoslav Communist Party is not the CCP's abandonment of its roots, but rather the exposure of its true colors. From this, we can gain many explanations:</p>
<p>First, the characteristic of the Communist Party does not lie in its adherence to communism, but in its class nature, its struggle nature, and its international nature, especially the final international nature. In the era of Marx and Engels, the international nature of the Communist Party only referred to "workers have no motherland". But after the October Revolution in the Soviet Union, it became "workers have a motherland", but this motherland is not the respective motherland of workers in various countries, but their common motherland "the Soviet Union" only. How do we know this? When the Information Bureau of the Communist International in Europe was established in September last year, it also emphasized national independence and national sovereignty in its declaration, but this time, in its resolution on the Yugoslav Communist Party, it condemned the Yugoslav Communist Party for implementing nationalism and not allowing it to adopt an independent and autonomous foreign policy. Why is the international nature of the Communist Party so contradictory? Obviously, so-called "International Supremacy" is "Soviet Supremacy." Those who are not loyal to the Soviet Union have abandoned internationalism, so their internationalism is another name for taking the Soviet Union as their motherland. This time, the CCP disregarded shame, willingly becoming an echo chamber for the Communist International, expressing its agreement with the resolution of the European Communist International, not particularly interested in the Yugoslav Communist Party incident, but rather expressing its "International Supremacy", wishing to be loyal to its master, the Soviet Union, in everything it does. Recently, the Associated Press reported news of a split in the CCP, saying that the communist party inside the customs might break away from the communist party in the northeast, which is a misperception caused by some Americans not understanding the nature of the CCP.</p>
<p>Second, on May 1 this year, the Communist Party's propaganda machine spread rumors in the Hong Kong area about "convening a new political consultative conference." Some professional politicians were all delighted, spreading the word that the Communist Party would form a "coalition government" with them. But a few days later, the CCP's Xinhua News Agency broadcast a speech by Mao Zedong, emphasizing that his regime must be led by the CCP. A few days later, the CCP area only clamored for "people's congresses," and did not mention a word about the "new political consultative conference." Now, the "Central Committee of the CCP" publicly agrees with the European Communist International's condemnation of the Yugoslav Communist Party, emphasizing class struggle and the leadership of the proletariat over the people's revolutionary cause. The professional politicians who are intoxicated by the dream of a "coalition government" can probably wake up after reading the CCP's statement!</p>
<p>In short, the CCP's belief in the doctrine of "International Supremacy", its willingness to be slaves to the master of the Iron Curtain, and its lack of a concept of the state or a sense of nationhood can be fully seen in this statement. Today, the government is leading the suppression of the rebellion. Suppressing the rebellion is already the current national policy. No citizen should have any doubts about it, and they should no longer harbor any illusions about the CCP, or regard it as an opposition party, or view it as an ordinary political party, or think that when the CCP comes, we can also engage in business and even participate in politics together. The United States is an advanced country in democratic politics and respects any political party, but it does not treat the Communist Party, which has an international nature and secretly acts as a Soviet spy, as an ordinary political party. The indictment of twelve Communist Party leaders in the United States is worthy of our vigilance and reference.</p>
<h3 id="e27">Minister of Transportation Yu Issues Statement: Price Increases in Transportation and Reduced Flights on Various Routes Mainly Due to High Fuel and Parts Prices <a href="#e27" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c27" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">27</a></h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 23rd Dispatch] Minister of Transportation Yu Dawei recently told reporters regarding the recent price increases in transportation and the reduction of flights by airlines that transportation is originally a service to the public and is not intended for profit. Recently, the outside world has felt that the price increases are too high, but in fact, if compared with the multiple increases in commodity prices, one can understand the difficulties of those who run transportation businesses. The main materials used to maintain transportation at present are fuel and parts. Today, the price of coal is 2.64 million times that of pre-war, aviation gasoline is 3.1 million times, diesel is 4.25 million times, while the railway passenger fare per kilometer is now 216,000 times, freight transport per kilometer is 629,000 times, and postage for ordinary letters is 300,000 times. From this, it can be seen that the actual amount of monthly losses in the transportation business is quite alarming. The recent reduction of flights by airlines also proves that the current prices are still not enough to maintain the minimum cost. The Ministry of Transportation has sent personnel to Shanghai to investigate the details and will do its best to solve their difficulties. Regarding the freight rates of all transportation businesses, the Ministry of Transportation is currently drafting measures to be submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval. The main issues are still the prices of fuel and urgently needed parts. It is hoped that the price of fuel can be fixed for a considerable period of time each time, so that the prices of transportation businesses can also be relatively stable for a considerable period of time. Minister Yu continued, stating that the work of the Ministry of Transportation in the past three years has been carried out under the principle of "rushing to repair North China and building South China." It was the same in the past, and it will be the same in the future. Although transportation workers in North China are in a difficult environment, they still have excellent performance. For example, when Chen Yi's bandit troops were driven out of the area north of the Longhai Railway a month ago, the workers of the Longhai Railway repaired the two sections from Xuzhou to Shangqiu and from Kaifeng to Zhengzhou in a few days. In short, as long as transportation personnel have a share of materials, they will do their best to the end.</p>

<p>Repeatedly Asked the United States to Relax Oil Limits</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 23rd Dispatch] The National Federation of Shipping Associations, recognizing the increasingly serious crisis in the shipping industry, has recently called for attention to the crisis of insufficient supply and skyrocketing prices of fuel oil and coal. According to information from the Ministry of Transportation, the supply of coal and oil is handled by the Fuel Management Committee and the Diesel Allocation Committee of the Import and Export Management Committee. However, the Ministry of Transportation also attaches great importance to the issues of fuel supply and stabilizing oil prices. The transportation of coal has always been given priority, and the new port of Tanggu is being actively built to facilitate the transport of northern coal to the south.

<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 23rd] Film artist Xia Tongguang, who was sent to the United States by the China Farmers Education Film Company for overseas study two years ago, has now returned to the country and arrived in Beijing. He stated that in Hollywood, he visited major companies such as 20th Century Fox, Paramount, and Warner, and conducted research work at RKO. The company has 32 studios and a large outdoor location, which is often decorated with streets showcasing the scenery of New York, Chicago, London, Paris, Mexico, China, and India, which can be easily changed and applied at any time. The vast ocean or the sails on a clear lake are all filmed from a large reservoir. American film art work is constantly evolving, and its design and techniques are constantly advancing rapidly. Generally, film companies have art departments, model departments, prop departments, and makeup departments. The American sanitation departments are all headed by architects, and engineers are invited to create samples, various mechanical appliances, etc. The chess model department is used for directors to choose camera angles, and each scene has a concrete and miniature model. The prop department has furnishings and clothing from ancient and modern times, from various countries and regions, like a museum. Even famous paintings and sculptures have replicas. Xia praised the close cooperation between various departments in the American film industry and the high efficiency of work. He never found any actors or technicians being late, which would affect the progress of the entire work. The personnel problems that often exist in general agencies and organizations in China do not exist in Hollywood.

Furthermore, the staff of the Johnson Film Company is only three people, who are responsible for writing, model making, photography, or using cakes cut into slices to explain what fractions or percentages are; or using building blocks to form maps to explain geographical products. This educational film is popular all over the United States. China's educational film production institutions can imitate their methods, without necessarily needing amazing funds and manpower. Xia also told reporters: Zheng Kunshan and others, Chinese nationals in the United States, have raised funds to establish a company to produce short films, including Zhang Shuqi's flower and bird paintings, Dai Aiyun's dance performances, etc., which are very popular there.</p>

<h3 id="e61">Britain, America and France Plan to Suggest to the Soviet Union Four-Power Talks on General Outstanding Issues But Still Take Lifting the Berlin Blockade as a Precondition General Clay Leaves Washington for Berlin <a href="#e61" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c61" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">61</a></h3>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 23rd] Official sources revealed: British and American officials in the military western allies next proposed to Moscow to protest the blockade of Berlin's note has been fully politically agreed. These include suggestions by the Soviet Union and the Western allies to discuss the whole German question and other outstanding issues between the two. Officials also explained that the discussion basis for the British, American and French military to initiate a new protest letter was a draft prepared by the United Kingdom, but the point of suggesting discussions with the Soviet Union on Germany and various other issues was a joint plan of the three countries, Britain, America and France. The three powers' insistence that the restoration of normal relations between West Germany and Berlin be a precondition for holding four-power talks is also a common opinion of the three powers. Observers believe that the three powers' suggestion to expand the scope of negotiations, not limited to the German question, can test whether the Soviet Union is truly sincere in peacefully resolving the problems of Berlin, Germany, and even the whole of Europe. This suggestion can make the Berlin problem not be treated as a particularly serious crisis, but to seek solutions together with other disputed outstanding issues, so that Europe can enjoy true peace and stability.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper News] New York 23rd Broadcast: General Clay attended a meeting of the House Foreign Affairs Committee today. Clay emphasized that the United States is determined to stay in Berlin and has the power to do so.

<p>[Reuters, London, 23rd] General Clay, the military governor of the American zone in Germany, may depart for Germany on the evening of the 23rd after holding confidential talks with Truman and Marshall in Washington. Personnel at the American embassy here confirmed the content of the draft of the second note sent by the three powers to the Soviet Union. Britain and America have expressed their agreement, and it can be delivered after the new French cabinet is established and approved. The "New York Times" reported this morning that Soviet Marshal Rukossovsky, who recently arrived in Germany, and Mr. Shanov, who was recently appointed as Sokolovsky's political advisor, have been separately responsible for directing the military and political offensives of the "Berlin Battle." The report also said that Marshal Sokolovsky has agreed to establish a communist dictatorship in the Soviet zone of Germany and Berlin in order to win the favor of the German communists.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 22nd] The British Cabinet met on the 22nd to discuss the Berlin crisis. The British defense chiefs were also summoned to attend, including the Chief of the Imperial General Staff Montgomery, the First Sea Lord Cunningham, and the Chief of Staff of the Ministry of Defense Hollis. The meeting lasted two hours.</p>
<h3 id="e62">Sokolovsky Explains the Reason for the Soviet Blockade of Berlin Is Because the American Zone Restricts the Freedom of Soviet Citizens to Travel <a href="#e62" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c62" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">62</a></h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Berlin, 22nd, United Press] Soviet Commander in Germany Sokolovsky declared that the Soviet Union's blockade of Berlin was because the United States did not allow Soviet personnel to enter the American-occupied zone. Sokolovsky also said that if the American-occupied zone allowed Soviet personnel to travel to and from the area, the Soviet Union could lift its blockade of Berlin. For the past three years, we have allowed American personnel to freely travel through international railways and highways from the Soviet-occupied zone to Berlin, but since June of this year, the United States suddenly stated that all Soviet personnel traveling to the American-occupied zone need to have appropriate entry permits, so we have taken the method of blockading Berlin as a countermeasure. According to Soviet military commanders, this is the first time that they have directly expressed opinions on the German question to reporters.</p>
<p>[United Press, Berlin, 23rd] The American military government announced on the 23rd: Soviet military governor Sokolovsky said that the reason why the Soviet Union blockaded Berlin was because the United States restricted travel in the occupied zone. American sources believe that Sokolovsky's words are a strategy to save face, and this move may promote the reopening of the Foreign Ministers' Conference. American Deputy Military Governor Hays said: "The United States has always been willing to maintain the highest degree of free movement between the occupied zones. The United States restricted free entry and exit to the American military zone on May 5th of this year because at that time the Soviet Union had restricted American personnel from entering and leaving the Soviet-occupied zone. American personnel could originally enter and leave the Soviet zone in several locations, but the Soviet Union later only opened Hamstedt, so the American side also restricted Soviet personnel to only enter and leave the American zone in that location, and there were no other restrictions."</p>
<p>[United Press, Paris, 23rd] French Foreign Ministry officials said today that they were "very interested" in Soviet military governor Sokolovsky's remarks to the United Press, but refused to make formal criticisms pending further study. However, authoritative sources said that the initial impression was that the Soviet side seemed to intend to dilute the serious problem and place all responsibility on the United States.</p>

<p>[Reuters, Frankfurt, 22nd] The Western occupying powers and the prime ministers of the West German states have reached an agreement on the rapid establishment of West Germany, although this is no longer a problem. The two committees organized by the Germans themselves can begin preparations for the establishment of a constitutional assembly next week. The prime ministers of the eleven West German states met in Ludwigsburg today and re-drafted a counter-proposal to the London Conference. After the completion of the draft, they announced that the West German prime ministers had decided to take full responsibility for reorganizing German affairs based on the powers granted to them by the occupation of Germany. The West German prime ministers will immediately establish two committees to draft a temporary constitution and adjust interstate boundaries, in order to prepare for the unification of the three West German occupation zones and to establish a parliament and administrative organs based on democratic principles in West Germany.</p>

<p>[Reuters, Berlin, 22nd] Two American military policemen and one German policeman mistakenly entered the Soviet zone in a car today and were detained.

<h3 id="e65">New French Premier Attends Parliament Today Presents List of New Cabinet Members and Announces Platform for Parliamentary Approval <a href="#e65" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c65" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">65</a></h3>
<p>[United Press, Paris, 23rd] French Prime Minister Mali has formed a new cabinet on the 23rd, and once the National Assembly approves his appointment on the 24th, the cabinet lineup can be presented. It is believed that Mali plans to recruit Blum, Reno, LeMardi, and outgoing Prime Minister Schumann into the cabinet. Observers believe that his chances of success are high. Mali telephoned President Oriel today, willing to decide his fate in parliament. Before the phone call, Mali met with first-class figures in the political world all night. If Mali succeeds in forming a cabinet, he would be the first Radical Socialist Party prime minister since Daladier's cabinet fell in 1940. The biggest stumbling block on the way to forming a cabinet was overcome on the morning of the 23rd due to the change of attitude of the People's Republican Party.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Paris, 22nd] Radical Party Mali, who was ordered to form a cabinet, had a long talk with the People's Republican Party this morning, trying to persuade People's Republican Party leader Bidault to give up the post of Foreign Minister and become a minister without portfolio. The People's Republican Party refused to agree, and the negotiations did not yield results. Apart from this point, Mali's cabinet formation negotiations with other parties were generally satisfactory. Mali revealed to reporters this morning that he has received good responses from all parties in parliament, from the Socialist Party to the right-wing Republican Freedom Party. He will report the progress of the negotiations to President Oriel around noon. At the same time, People's Republican Party members issued a statement this morning, saying that whether Mali will receive the party's support depends on his policy address to the National Assembly tomorrow when he introduces his new cabinet. Parliamentarians believe that this statement indicates that the People's Republican Party has agreed in principle to join the cabinet, but the final participation depends on the positions the party obtains. The most important thing is of course that the position of Foreign Minister must still be held by Bidault. It is generally believed that Mali's ability to obtain a vote of confidence from the National Assembly tomorrow is decisively related to the resolution of the Bidault issue.</p>

<p>[Report from this newspaper] New York, 23rd Broadcast: Belgrade report; President of the Pan-Slavic Committee, Masarale, told the Yugoslav Communist Party Congress today that the people of Poland and Czechoslovakia harbor doubts about the statement condemning Yugoslavia issued by the Communist Information Bureau. Masarale stated that during his recent travels to Poland and Czechoslovakia, many communist party members and ordinary people told him that the Communist Information Bureau's condemnation of Marshal Tito and Yugoslavia also applied to the communist parties of the two countries.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Belgrade, 23rd Dispatch] Rankovic, the Yugoslav Minister of Internal Affairs who was condemned by the Communist Information Bureau, addressed the South Communist Congress yesterday, admitting that the South Communist Party had made mistakes and oversights during the war, but since liberation, it has effectively utilized the abundant experience gained from the Soviet friendly party in the South. The party's cadres were created according to the Bolshevik system. From 1937 until the occupation of Yugoslavia, the leading personnel within the party were all produced through elections by the party congress. The party headquarters trained party members based on the spirit of Marxism-Leninism. He solemnly denied the Communist Information Bureau's allegations that South Communist officials were appointed rather than elected.</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, Lake Success, 22nd Dispatch] There was a slight disturbance at the United Nations Headquarters this afternoon. A bomb suddenly exploded 350 yards from the United Nations office building, but fortunately there were no deaths. According to witnesses, the bomb was a parachute bomb dropped by a low-flying training aircraft as it passed over the building. This is the first such incident since the establishment of the United Nations. Local security authorities believe the incident was purely a prank. The bomb was one used by postal aircraft as a signal when dropping mail.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, New York, 23rd Dispatch] The person who flew a small plane and dropped a small bomb over the United Nations Headquarters has been identified as a tea server at a hotel. During World War II, he served as a gunner on a B19 bomber. He is currently studying flying under the GI Bill training program. He flew a small plane from Connecticut, 100 miles from Long Island, to drop a bomb over the United Nations building. The bomb exploded in the air. It is said that this person has a peculiar attitude towards the Berlin crisis. He once told people that someone should step forward and bomb the United Nations at this time. There have been two "bombings" of the United Nations. Previously, during the United Nations debate on the Holy Land dispute, an American Jewish pilot flew a single-engine plane over the United Nations and distributed 10,000 leaflets advocating the partition of the Holy Land. These two incidents have led some United Nations staff to believe that the United Nations lacks defenses against attacks by madmen and dreamers, and in this world crisis situation, there are many such madmen.</p>

<p>[Agence France-Presse, Rome, 22nd Dispatch] The Italian Senate today rejected the government impeachment motion proposed by Communist Senator Tracinni by a vote of 173 to 83. Premier Gasperi then spoke to conclude the debate, saying that the events of the past few weeks have proven that the Communist Party is preparing to revolt. The national disturbances, the misuse of weapons, and the widespread strikes all prove that the Communist Party is determined to carry out a conspiracy against the state. The current situation in the country is like that in Czechoslovakia. Gasperi then read out a booklet issued by the Communist Party in several cities, inciting the people to revolt and establishing action committees, saying that the current situation is indeed very serious, and the government must do everything possible to deal with it to prevent a violent coup. The Communist Party is using the "Plan to Defend the Italian Communist Party" as a cover to carry out its rebellion plan, but the government will not tolerate it. In view of the current situation and the psychology of the Communist Party, the government will find it difficult to cooperate with it. He then mentioned the Communist Information Bureau's overbearing order to the Belgrade government, saying that cabinet members who accept foreign orders should not be allowed to remain in the government. He again mentioned the domestic economic situation, saying that 50% of Italian industries are currently subsidized by the state, and the people are greatly affected by strikes, which can only be addressed with socialized reforms. Without socialized reforms, the overall situation cannot be stabilized. Finally, he mentioned the danger of frequent cabinet crises, citing France as an example. Finally, he emphasized that the government is determined to defend the freedom enjoyed by all citizens of the country, and praised the achievements of Interior Minister Selba.</p>

Around 1:00 pm, the gallery of Criminal Division 2 was already crowded with the families of the defendants. After Judge Zhong Xiantai ascended the court, the faces of the defendants and their families suddenly became tense. Feng Aina even burst into tears.

<p>[Report from this newspaper] Representatives of various foreign utility companies in the city, including Hopkins of the Shanghai Power Company, Franglais of the Shanghai Telephone Company, Simpson of the British Gas Company, Latodi of the French Tramway Company, and Pollock, the representative of the Shanghai Tramway Company, visited Mayor Wu at the Municipal Government at 3 pm yesterday to report that after the recent surge in prices, costs have skyrocketed. The companies have so far lost 5 trillion yuan and are unable to maintain their operations. They requested the Municipal Government to find a solution for relief. Mayor Wu and Director Zhao of the Public Utilities Bureau received them in the conference room. Mayor Wu expressed two points from the government's position: on the one hand, the burden on citizens must be considered, and on the other hand, the operations of utility companies must also be considered. He hoped that the companies would submit specific solutions based on the actual losses. The Municipal Government will then telegraph the Executive Yuan, the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, the Ministry of Interior, and the Ministry of Transportation to send relevant personnel to Shanghai to hold a meeting in the Municipal Government conference room at 2:00 pm on the 27th of this month.

<p>[Report from this newspaper] An official from the Shanghai Power Company told reporters yesterday that he had a slight addition to the report that the company would read meters and charge fees twice a month from next month. He said that the power company has about 100,000 users, and 400 of them (mostly factories, with monthly power consumption of more than 10,000 degrees) account for more than 70% of the total power consumption of all users. At a time when the value of currency is depreciating sharply, the power company itself is experiencing difficulties in the turnover of funds, and it cannot allow these large users to use electricity first and pay later. According to the company, users start using electricity at the beginning of each month, and the meters are read and settled around the 5th of the following month, and all users are notified to pay in the middle of the following month, which is equivalent to users using electricity first and paying on credit for six weeks before paying. In order to facilitate the company's working capital, starting from next month, large users with 400 households will be charged once every half month. The bill for the first half of the month will be based on the past month's electricity consumption, and the price will be estimated and large users will be notified to pay around the 20th of each month. The second half of the month will be read and settled as usual around the 5th, and then large users will be notified to pay the difference in electricity consumption for one month. As for the remaining nearly 100,000 small users, the method of reading meters and paying bills every month will remain temporarily unchanged.</p>

<p>[Report from relevant sources] Although the establishment of the Economic Control Bureau has been decided, its scope of functions and the selection of responsible persons are still under consideration by the authorities. It is not true that a decision has already been made. It is said that the central government initially intended Mayor Wu to take the position of director, but the mayor firmly declined. As a result, someone suggested that Chiang Ching-kuo be responsible, but this was also not agreed upon. Most people believe that it would be most reasonable for Yu Hongjun to concurrently hold this position in terms of common sense. However, up to now, although there have been various rumors about this, they are all speculative and cannot be deeply believed. In the future, after the bureau is formally established, its nature will only be a design and decision-making institution, and its scale will not be very large. The promotion of business will also be the responsibility of the current competent authorities. Only because of the existence of the bureau can the effect of coordination and cooperation be achieved. As for how many agencies the Economic Management Bureau can command, it will be decided only after the Executive Yuan meeting is held for discussion.</p>

Yesterday, it was decided to add four modification methods: (1) The original minimum of 50 bags was changed to 10 bags, (2) The original maximum amount of no more than 1,000 bags was increased to "may be reduced depending on the actual situation," (3) Taiwan Sugar's quoted price shall not exceed the market price, (4) The original quotation time in the morning was changed to the afternoon.</p>
<p>Some Taiwan Sugar merchants who were previously reselling Taiwan Sugar were permanently suspended from distribution due to adulteration, watering, and shortage of weight. The South Goods Industry Association requested the association to reconsider its decision because its punishment was too severe, but it was not discussed yesterday.</p>

<h3 id="e85">August Rice Ration Prices Expected to Reach 40 Million Per Stone - Ration Prices for the Poor to be Decided After Meeting <a href="#e85" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c85" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">85</a></h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] The US side insists that the August household rice price must be calculated at 95% of the average price of the last five days of this month. If calculated according to this method, the household rice will reach 40 million yuan per stone, which is almost the same as the market price. The People's Livelihood Committee is currently negotiating with the US side, hoping to reduce the burden on citizens. However, due to the restrictions of the Sino-US agreement, it is feared that there will be no effect. Currently, the People's Livelihood Committee is organizing a special rice distribution at preferential prices for the poor starting in August, in an attempt to remedy this defect. According to Section Chief Zhang of the Press Office of the committee, there are 5 million citizens in this city, and the truly poor account for about one-fifth. Only if these 1 million people have food to eat can social order be stabilized. It is rumored that after the implementation of rice distribution for the poor, the ordinary household rice will be cancelled, which is absolutely incorrect.</p>
<p>In addition, the People's Livelihood Committee's investigation of the work of the poor in various districts is limited to completion tomorrow. The list of the poor will be announced at the office of the head of each neighborhood. Those who are not poor and mingle among them may be reported by the public and removed. Those who are indeed poor and have been omitted may apply for supplementary reporting. This list of the poor will be finalized at the end of this month and purchase permits will be issued to the poor immediately, attached with the household rice purchase certificate, which will be discounted according to the household rice price. The calculation method is yet to be decided at the meeting.</p>
<h3 id="e86">Japanese Ship Loads Goods and Sails to Qinhuangdao - China Merchants Bureau Requests Submission for Negotiation <a href="#e86" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c86" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">86</a></h3>
<p>The Japanese ship Samarin Maru, under the order of the Allied Headquarters, loaded kiln wood and sleepers and arrived in Qinhuangdao from Kobe on the 19th. According to the investigation, the ship's arrival in China is a barter trade between the China Trust Bureau and Japan, which has nothing to do with infringing on our shipping rights. However, according to the person in charge of the China Merchants Bureau, the Bureau's Zizhong ship has been to Japan three times, intending to load kiln wood and sleepers in Japan and other places, but all three times it returned empty-handed, losing the goods. Therefore, the arrival of the Japanese ship Samarin Maru in Qinhuangdao is quite incomprehensible. A telegram has been sent to the Executive Yuan, the Ministry of Transportation, and other relevant departments, requesting that negotiations be initiated.</p>

<p>[Report from this newspaper] The case of the Shanghai Linwang, Sanwei, and Dahua companies privately converting huge amounts of foreign exchange has attracted much attention from all parties. After the police department transferred the case to the Special Criminal Court for investigation, it has been two months. It is learned that the case will soon be concluded and a decision will be made whether to prosecute. Wang Zhennan, the President of the Special Criminal Court, said that the case does not comply with the Regulations on Punishing Emergency Crimes Endangering the State during the Period of Suppression of Rebellion. After applying to the Ministry of Justice for approval, the investigation will be conducted using the Central Bank's Foreign Exchange Control Regulations and the Regulations on Punishing the Purchase and Sale of Gold and Foreign Currency.</p>
<h3 id="e88">Ban on Iron-Wheeled Trucks - Provisional Measures Passed Yesterday in Municipal Affairs Conference <a href="#e88" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c88" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">88</a></h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] The Municipal Government previously limited the conversion of iron-wheeled trucks to pneumatic tires to be completed before July 1, 1948. Later, the City Tiger Truck Professional Union submitted a request to the Social Affairs Bureau, asking for gradual implementation after prices stabilize. Recently, the Public Utilities Bureau convened representatives from the Police Bureau, the Public Works Bureau, the Tiger Truck Professional Union, and the Collapse Tiger Truck Commercial Guild to discuss and agree on two principles: (1) Iron-wheeled trucks, such as those who voluntarily convert to pneumatic-tired vehicles, should still be converted as much as possible; however, after the conversion, attention should be paid to the size of the vehicle itself (after a 500-pound iron-wheeled vehicle is converted to a pneumatic-tired vehicle, the load shall not exceed 1,000 pounds, and after an iron-wheeled vehicle of 1,000 pounds or more is converted to a pneumatic-tired vehicle, the load shall not exceed 2,240 pounds). (2) If the owner is unable to convert the iron-wheeled truck to a pneumatic-tired vehicle, it is proposed to levy an additional fee for road repairs. Provisional measures for banning iron-wheeled tiger trucks in urban areas after July 1, 1948 were drafted and submitted for approval at yesterday's 135th Municipal Affairs Conference. The measures state that all large and small iron-wheeled tiger trucks that cannot be converted to pneumatic tires within the limited time of July 1, if they are still driving in the city after July 1, 1948, in addition to paying the vehicle license tax to the Finance Bureau in violation of the regulations, they must also pay a fine for the delayed conversion of iron-wheeled tiger trucks to pneumatic tires before they can obtain a license to drive, in order to show the ban. The fine for the delayed conversion of pneumatic tires is temporarily set at 2 million yuan per vehicle per year.</p>
<h3 id="e89">Wind, Rain, and Hail Damage - This Year's Pinghu Melon Production Reduced - Second Vine Melon Prices Expected to Exceed 10 Million <a href="#e89" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c89" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">89</a></h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] The heat is approaching, and watermelons are already on the market. Although prices are quite alarming due to the high cost of everything, compared with other cold drinks, it is still a popular summer refreshment. The watermelons in this city rely on the supply from Chongming, Pudong, Suzhou, and Pinghu, but among them, the pillow melon from Pinghu is delicious and popular, and the production area is also large, so it is listed as a major item. In the past, when melons were ripe, the sales of Pinghu melons in this city reached as many as 2 to 3 million pieces. According to people in the industry, this year's Pinghu watermelons could have been expected to have a bumper harvest, but due to the previous typhoon and hail damage, coupled with more than ten consecutive days of rain, the melon vines were damaged and the output was greatly affected. Therefore, it is estimated that only about 500,000 dans can be transported to this city for sale this year. The first vine melons that appeared in the middle of this month have been transported to 50,000 to 60,000 dans. Due to insufficient sweetness and the influence of the climate, they were only sold for 4 to 5 million yuan per dan at the cheapest time. Yesterday, due to the heat, the price rose to about 8 million yuan per dan. If the weather continues to be sunny for several days, the second vine melons that will be on the market will not only increase in sweetness, but if the actual sales are strong, the price will undoubtedly exceed 10 million. Most of the watermelon shops in this city are concentrated in the Dongmen Road and Limalu areas of the Shiliupu, among which the largest are Yongde, Tang Hengtai, Xiangmao, Pan Yuansheng, and Shunchang, and there are about 30 other smaller shops. Each shop has its own ships to transport melons from Pinghu to Shanghai. The freight is calculated in rice, requiring 15 stones per ship per month. One ship can load more than 3,000 melons. However, due to the reduced melon volume and high interest rates, it is said that the profits of the melon shops are not as good as before.</p>
<p>In the past, some melon merchants purchased a large number of melons during the melon season and stored them in cold storage warehouses, so that they could be sold at good prices during Christmas and winter. This kind of transaction, which is not noticed by ordinary people, is extremely profitable. This year, the watermelon production has suddenly decreased, which is a good opportunity for this industry to purchase and store, but due to the high rent of the warehouses and the ability of Taiwanese watermelons to be sold in Shanghai in winter, it is said that no one has made this plan as of now.</p>
<h3 id="e90">Social Affairs Bureau Seals Suspicious Warehouse Materials - Organizing Review Committee to Discuss Handling Methods <a href="#e90" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c90" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">90</a></h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] In order to suppress and stabilize prices, starting from the 16th of this month, the Social Affairs Bureau, the Garrison Department, the Military Police Corps, and the Police Bureau jointly inspected 34 warehouses that had not reported exceeding the time limit in five groups, and the investigation of the war has been completed recently. The reporter visited Director Wu of the Social Affairs Bureau yesterday and inquired about the results of the inspection. He was told: "The most in these warehouses are gauze, paper, coal, and diesel. Because the quantity is very large, statistics are still being compiled. There are also items stored in 1947, among which there are the following three suspected items: (1) hoarding goods exceeding three months' needs, (2) non-industry personnel engaged in hoarding, (3) stack orders are unregistered and only have the words "Pay upon presentation of the order". All of these have been sealed, and the warehouse managers have been ordered to guarantee that they will not be moved. Today (the 23rd), the Municipal Affairs Conference decided that the Social Affairs Bureau would invite the Municipal Council, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, the Police Bureau, the Monetary Administration Bureau, and the Municipal Government Counselor's Office to form a review committee to hold a meeting next week to discuss the handling methods. It is proposed to hand over the verified hoarded goods to the market for sale at par prices, and the proceeds will be returned to the original owner after deducting the fines, but the goods hoarded by non-industry personnel will be confiscated. If there is legal liability involved, it will be transferred to the judicial organs for handling. These handling methods will be submitted to the Municipal Government for approval after consultation before implementation. Other warehouses that have been reported will also be continuously inspected to assess whether they are false or not."</p>

<p>The Finance Committee of the Municipal Council held its 26th meeting yesterday afternoon at 3 p.m., with a heated discussion on the draft of the city bank organization regulations. It was finally decided that, before the central government promulgates the organizational law for municipal banks, the city bank will temporarily maintain its current status. The committee will also nominate seven councilors to be responsible for researching organizational regulations suitable for the city bank's needs and submit them to the central government for reference. The proposal to exempt suburban stores from business license tax was also approved. In addition, the Committee on Autonomous Law Research and the Committee on Separate Regulations also held separate meetings yesterday afternoon.</p>
<h3 id="e92">General Household Re-Registration Postponed to Next Month <a href="#e92" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c92" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">92</a></h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] The general household re-registration, originally scheduled for the 20th of this month by the Public Security and Police Bureaus, has been postponed to August due to insufficient staffing. At the same time, national identity cards will also be inspected, with the entire process lasting ten days. The Police Bureau announced the inspection dates, methods, and work procedures as follows yesterday: (1) A general census of hotels and inns will be conducted on the afternoon of August 1st. Special teams will also be dispatched to inspect vagrants and beggars with no fixed abode, refugees sleeping on the streets, and boats, etc. Starting at 8 a.m. on August 2nd, inspections of all types of households on land will be carried out (including all stores, residences, factories, institutions, schools, etc.). (2) All inspection personnel will be divided into several teams, with the bao [neighborhood unit] as the unit. Each team will consist of one police officer, two bao cadres, one household registration cadre, and one auxiliary police officer. Special teams will be established in important areas to focus on inspecting the population with no fixed abode. All stationed guards in various locations must assist. Furthermore, before the general household re-registration begins, the Public Security and Police Bureaus will screen lantern slide advertisements in local cinemas to educate citizens on basic household registration knowledge.</p>
<h3 id="e93">Large Denomination Notes Appear, Prices Soar, The Lives of Ordinary People Become Increasingly Difficult <a href="#e93" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c93" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">93</a></h3>
<p>[Special report from this newspaper] Since the introduction of the five million yuan denomination note, no matter how the National Bank tightens credit, no matter how the wholesale price increases slow down, general retail prices remain stubbornly high. Just look, in the past three or four days, the prices of everything one eats and wears have increased by 50% to 100%. The ones who suffer the most are the ordinary people. Going to the market early in the morning to buy vegetables, the price of pork has reached one million yuan per catty. Beef is not far behind, at 900,000 yuan per catty. Refrigerated yellow croaker costs 40,000 to 50,000 yuan per tael, chicken eggs cost 70,000 to 80,000 yuan each, and duck eggs range from 60,000 to 90,000 yuan each. As a second choice, let's eat vegetarian. But vegetarian dishes are no longer what they used to be. A small piece of tofu costs 100,000 yuan, yellow bean sprouts cost 140,000 yuan per catty, green vegetables, potatoes, and mung bean sprouts cost 100,000 yuan per catty. With cooking oil costing nearly one million yuan per catty, the price difference between vegetarian and meat dishes is only a short distance.</p>
<p>Buying Coal Balls Guaranteed to Receive Scorn</p>
<p>Saving where possible and forcing oneself to eat vegetarian, one might gain a reputation for dieting in the summer. But things don't go as planned. With less oil in one's stomach, the consumption of rice increases by double. The household rice ration is not enough, so one has to turn to the black market for rice, costing 44 million yuan per dan [a unit of dry measure]. Market reports clearly state that the retail price of coal balls is 3.6 million yuan per dan. However, when you offer this price to a coal ball store, you are guaranteed to receive a scornful look from the owner. Ask at the second store, and the clerks will tell you that coal balls at 3.6 million yuan are sold out. Now they only have coal balls at 5.5 million yuan per dan. The most heartless thing is soap, which only rises in price and never goes back down, costing 700,000 yuan per bar. To make matters worse, it's the hot season. After bathing, one still has to do laundry, and a bar doesn't last long. Even more frightening is the increase in water prices, which has jumped two to three times. The average household water bill for this month is around 6 million yuan. This is difficult for ordinary couples who rely on firewood, rice, oil, and salt, and even more so for those on salaries who only get paid at the end of the month. What's worse is that July's income is still calculated based on the June cost of living index. After all the twists and turns, those on salaries can only sit and wait for their "demise."</p>
<p>Medical Expenses Exceed Ten Million After Three Visits</p>
<p>In a famine year, one can't be too picky about food. But when a smoking addiction flares up, it's truly unbearable. Looking at the various cigarettes in the cigarette shop, the prices are new every day. Imported "Camel," "Lucky Strike," and "Marlboro" cigarettes are all around one million yuan. Even "British American Tobacco," "Old Gold," and "Craven A" are hovering around 300,000 yuan. One or two packs a day will further increase the deficit in the household's monthly budget. The weather is suddenly cold and suddenly hot, with unpredictable sunshine and rain. Colds and stomachaches are common minor ailments, but if you can't endure them and consult a hospital, the registration fee alone costs one million yuan. A few small packets of medicine powder will cost you 2 or 3 million yuan. If you calculate three visits to the doctor, the total expenditure will exceed the ten million yuan mark. A shoe store on Nanjing Road advertised a 20% discount for summer shoes ten days ago. At the beginning, a pair of ordinary black leather shoes was priced at 13.6 million yuan after the 20% discount. How long ago was it? Now the price tag reads 25.6 million yuan, while the 20% discount sign is still prominently displayed.</p>
<p>Ice Cream Powder Snatched Up</p>
<p>In a department store on the same road, cotton athletic socks were priced at 600,000 yuan per pair last weekend. After the large denomination notes were introduced, the price increased to 1.1 million yuan. Short white wool athletic socks, originally priced at 3 million yuan per pair and only available in small sizes, increased to 6 million yuan after the large denomination notes were introduced, and all sizes became available. The price of ice cream powder from the Materials Supply Bureau has gradually increased from 750,000 yuan to 3.84 million yuan per can. Two weeks ago, each distributor still had 100 cans available for retail sale each day, but they were snatched up in less than fifteen minutes after opening in the morning. This batch of ice cream powder was sold out by distributors a week ago. It is said that the Materials Supply Bureau has a considerable amount of stock, but they have stopped distributing it when it is most needed in the market, causing the price of ice cream powder to rise to 14 million yuan per can in the past two days. Isn't this creating opportunities for scalpers?</p>
<p>The Wealthy Enjoy Themselves</p>
<p>Large companies have "Arrow" brand shirts for 70 million yuan each, boxes of 25 expensive cigars for 90 million yuan each, bottles of "Remy Martin" brandy for 55 million yuan each, bottles of whiskey for 85 million yuan each, Western suits for 1 billion yuan each, "Parker" gold pens (14K) for 640 million yuan per set, refrigerators, electric stoves, and washing machines for 4 billion to 5 billion yuan each... In the eyes of dignitaries and officials, as long as there is a market and they have spare money, they can afford to buy these things. Shanghai is a world for the wealthy. No matter how refugees cry out, how public servants complain, or how those on salaries lament their suffering, the wealthy still indulge in pleasure, and the poor deserve their fate.</p>

Their daily income was about 4 to 5 million yuan. After deducting expenses, the remaining money was deposited in the Si Ming Bank to earn interest. After further interrogation, the confession of the suspects was found to be true, and they were transferred to the Songhu Garrison Command for legal action.</p>

<p>[Reported by this newspaper] Watson's Soda Company hosted the local press yesterday to visit the Coca-Cola production process, which can be divided into five parts: sterilizing the water, mixing ingredients, washing bottles, filling, and capping. The company's Infilco water sterilization machine is the latest and most effective machine. After clean water enters the water tank, it is first sterilized with nitrogen, then filtered through sand filters, paper filters, and activated carbon. The walls and floor of the mixing room are covered with ceramic tiles, making it exceptionally clean. Syrup is stored in sealed stainless steel barrels, and the mixer inside the barrel does not come into contact with the air. The room is equipped with a sterilizing ultraviolet lamp to kill bacteria in the air. The bottle washing process is the most complex. The bottle washing machine is 53 feet long. Old bottles are sent into the machine and automatically rotate forward, taking nine minutes to complete, going through 65 different types of rinsing. Finally, skilled workers carefully inspect them under strong light, eliminating empty bottles that have not been completely cleaned. After inspection, the empty bottles are sent by an automatic conveyor chain to the syrup filling machine. After filling to a certain amount, they are automatically moved to the capping machine for capping. At this point, the entire manufacturing process is complete. From washing the empty bottles, mixing ingredients, filling, and capping, the entire process is handled by machines. Workers only manage the machines and never touch the bottle openings directly with their fingers.</p>

<p>[Reported by this newspaper] At around 3:00 a.m. yesterday morning, three thieves suddenly came to the Minglu Garden on Dantian Road, Hongqiao Road. They were discovered by the guard, Chen Wanli, who immediately pursued them. Unexpectedly, he was hit in the head by their bolt cutters. Chen shouted in pain. Just then, auxiliary police officer Ye Xiaoxun of the Longhua Police Sub-Bureau heard the shout and rushed to the scene, capturing one thief, Huang Guicai, along with the weapon, the bolt cutters, and took them to the bureau.

<h3 id="e109">The Mogan Mountain Under Construction: A "Peach Blossom Spring," But Not "Beyond the World" - The Old Three-Year Plan Is No Longer Adequate <a href="#e109" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c109" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">109</a></h3>
<p>— Our Reporter Huang Xing-tian</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Hangzhou, 22nd Dispatch] In the sweltering summer, the name of Mogan Mountain is once again on people's minds, because it represents a secluded and cool summer resort, as famous as Qingdao and Guling, both at home and abroad. Mogan Mountain is located in Wukang County, Zhejiang Province, a branch of the Tianmu Mountains, with an average altitude of 1,800 to 2,000 feet. The highest peak is Tashan, which is 2,500 feet above sea level. To the east, one can see the Qiantang River, and to the north, one can see Tai Lake. Historically, the name of Mogan Mountain is said to have come from the story of King Helü of Wu ordering Gan Jiang and Mo Ye to cast swords on the mountain. Later generations named it in their memory. Mogan Mountain became a summer resort after the seventh year of Emperor Guangxu's reign in the Qing Dynasty. Initially, several European and American hunters discovered that this place had beautiful scenery and a cool climate, making it an ideal summer resort. Therefore, they flocked to purchase land on the mountain from the monks of Tianchi Temple to build villas. Later, wealthy people from Shanghai also followed suit and built houses on the mountain. By the 17th year of the Republic of China, when Zhang Jingjiang governed Zhejiang, there was already a considerable number of residents on the mountain, and a Mogan Mountain Management Bureau was specially established as an administrative body. Since then, it has prospered year by year. Although it suffered some damage during the war, it was less than one-tenth of its original state, and the scale remained the same. Currently, there are more than 200 houses on the mountain, with a summer transient population of over 10,000 (not including those who come to play temporarily), and the permanent population in the area has reached 40,000. Climbing up the steps, lush bamboo grows on both sides, and white clouds float in the mountainside, making one suspect that the mountain is above the clouds, and the ornate buildings are like mirages. Such a "Peach Blossom Spring"-like realm inevitably attracts the attention of Chinese and Western people from Shanghai, who compete to escape the summer heat.</p>
<p>Does escaping the summer heat require US dollars?</p>
<p>In fact, not many people went to Mogan Mountain to escape the summer heat this year. The main reason is that although Mogan Mountain is a "Peach Blossom Spring," it is not "beyond the world." It cannot avoid the impact of rising prices. Many people say that escaping the summer heat on Mogan Mountain requires calculations in US dollars, and staying for one or two nights can cost as much as 100 million national currency, which scares many people away. Although Mogan Mountain does have foreign houses that are rented in US dollars (usually 600 US dollars per season), and there are places where wealthy guests can spend hundreds of millions of dollars a day, this is from a luxurious perspective. Mogan Mountain has the Mogan Hotel, which costs 10 to 20 million per night, and also small hotels and apartments that cost 1 to 2 million per day, and even temporary rooms in ordinary hotels that cost 400,000 to 500,000 to spend the night. Accommodation is like this, and so is eating. In short, the prices on Mogan Mountain are generally similar to those in Hangzhou. If you make the most economical plan, you can spend three days of cool and quiet life on the mountain for 20 million yuan. Currently, there are more than 20 large and small hotels on the mountain, which can accommodate 1,000 to 2,000 people per day. There are three restaurants, but the main business is still in the dining departments of the hotels.</p>
<p>Planned New Projects</p>
<p>During the Anti-Japanese War, the public and private buildings and the collapsed water sources and roads on Mogan Mountain could not be quickly repaired due to financial difficulties. In order to restore the old appearance and seek development, the Mogan Mountain Management has been implementing a three-year reconstruction plan for Mogan Mountain since this year. The construction projects to be carried out in this plan include: (1) Roads: The old road from Yucun to Mogan Mountain (12,517 feet long) will be completely rebuilt with cement paving, and the surface of the new road up the mountain (19,580 feet long) will be repaired, and the road system of the entire mountain will be determined according to the natural environment. (2) Electricity: A power plant will be set up under Tashan, and two 75-horsepower diesel generators will be installed, and underground power lines will be connected to various users. (3) Water Supply: The original water sources will be repaired, and a large-scale reservoir will be planned at the southern end of Zhonghua Mountain to solve the water supply problem for residents of Gangtou Road. (4) Sewerage: The sewerage system will be gradually completed along with the new road system. (5) Public Buildings: Public buildings in the mountain, such as auditoriums, libraries, swimming pools, and ballrooms, have already taken shape, and it is planned to repair the road pavilions. (6) Scenic Spots and Historical Sites: The main scenic spots and historical sites, such as Jianchi (Sword Pond), Luhuadang (Reed Flower Marsh), Tashan Park, Guaishigu (Strange Stone Valley), Biwu (Emerald House), Shijing (Stone Surprise), and Zhiji Pavilion, will be repaired first. In addition, security police will be strengthened, trees and flowers will be planted, and attention will be paid to cleanliness and hygiene. The entire plan is scheduled to be completed in the 39th year of the Republic of China (1950), and its funding will come entirely from the Reconstruction Donation. The Reconstruction Donation has been levied since July 1st this year. It is estimated that 7 billion can be collected this year. The collection targets are divided into two parts: one is the owners, who will be charged 5% of the house price, divided into six grades, with the highest rate being 25 per thousand of the house price, and it is estimated that 4 billion can be collected. The other is tourists, who will be charged 20% of the room rate, and it is estimated that 3 billion can be collected. However, according to the previous collection situation, it is estimated that only half of it will be collected, about 3 billion or more. However, the construction project is still actively underway, and 60% of this year's plan has been completed.</p>
<p>Civilian Construction Plan</p>
<p>When the reporter went to Mogan Mountain, it coincided with the Zhejiang Provincial Government's decision to expand the administrative area of the Mogan Mountain Management Bureau, ordering the relevant counties of Wukang, Wuxing, and Anji to quickly handle the handover. According to this new area, starting from Sanqiaobu in Wukang in the east, Xiaoguanqiao in Wukang in the south, Wuanqiao in Wukang in the west, and Biwu in Wuxing in the north, within a radius of more than 120 kilometers, there are sixteen scenic areas, including Gaofeng Mountain, Shuangji Mountain, Yangmei Mountain, Zhai Mountain, Shanqiaobu, Shiyi Mountain, Tongguan Mountain, Liantongtan, Moling, Bijia Mountain, Yizi Mountain, Xianrenwan, Liuhe Mountain, Biwu, Tianquan Mountain, and Hemuqiao. Among them, Tianquan Mountain, originally belonging to Wuxing, covers an area of 400 mu, with towering trees and clear springs, making it an ideal place to escape the summer heat, even more pleasant than Mogan Mountain itself. Therefore, the newly appointed Director of the Mogan Mountain Management Bureau, Wang Zhengyi, deeply felt that the old three-year plan was inadequate. Therefore, he will design another comprehensive construction plan to prosper this summer resort that is missed by thousands of people. But even more precious is his other ambition: he will make Mogan Mountain civilianized, taking this summer resort from the hands of the big capitalists and serving the middle class and the common people of the city. He is not satisfied with tall buildings and big mansions, but quite admires the simple and beautiful small foreign houses built by the Japanese in the summer resort of Taiwan. Therefore, he quite wants to follow the example of the Germans in managing Qingdao, buying all the land on the mountain at a low price, and then systematically dividing it into countless small pieces, each with an area of one or two mu, and selling them to the people at a fair price. This will not only solve the problem of construction funding, but also make the prosperity of Mogan Mountain easier to achieve. Currently, a small number of people own a large amount of land, arbitrarily raising land prices, making the price of Mogan Mountain land equal to the land price in the most bustling areas of Hangzhou City, making many people who want to build houses on the mountain also speechless and hesitant. Such an unreasonable phenomenon will not reappear under the plan of public ownership of land.</p>
<p>This is a lovely vision. In the future, we will see that those who come to Mogan Mountain to escape the summer heat will not only be the Russians, Jews, Americans, and large Shanghai merchants who are rich in US dollars, but more will be people from the common class. Even small civil servants and intellectuals can easily go to the mountain to escape the summer heat. Although this seems like a luxurious dream today, it is not an impossible plan after all. We hope that Director Wang will continue to move forward!</p>
<p>Meat Merchants in Suzhou, Wuxi, and Wujin Resume Business Today</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Suzhou, 23rd Dispatch] The strike by meat merchants in Suzhou, Wuxi, and Wujin counties, protesting the sharp increase in slaughter tax rates, has ended. Today, representatives of the meat merchants from the three counties petitioned the Friendship Association of the Speakers of the Eight County Councils held in Wuxi. After mediation by the Speaker of Wuxi, Li Tiping, and the tax bureaus of the three counties, the tax per pig was revised to 3.02 million yuan, a reduction of 580,000 yuan. Both parties were satisfied, and the meat merchants decided to resume business on the 24th.</p>

<p>Five Arrested, Others Under Surveillance</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 23rd Dispatch] A strange incident occurred in Beiping: Lu Jiefu, who claimed to be the Chairman of the Northeast Provisional High School Student Autonomous Association, and members of the "[麻茹团]" (Ma Ru Tuan) group under his leadership, were arrested for forcing female classmates to rape at knifepoint and embezzling public funds. According to Sun Pengyue, the captain of the investigation team of the Dongda Student Autonomous Association, who assisted in resolving this incident, Lu was among the first batch of people who came to Beiping. He appointed himself as the Chairman of the Provisional High School Student Autonomous Association, embezzled public funds, and acted recklessly. He also purchased eleven electric knives from the remaining materials of the US military and distributed them to the group members who were coerced and lured into joining. Lu was equipped with a badge from a certain pacification agency and claimed to be related to a certain agency. He told his group members that after training, they could be sent to work in Harbin, Chahar, and other places. If they refused to join, he threatened them with electric knives and guns. Lu also privately carved the seal of the Tieling Middle School of Liaoning Province and the principal's seal, manufactured and sold certificates, and carried a temporary leave certificate with the number 9379 from a certain agency's major staff officer. Here, Lu once forced female classmate Fu Wenliang to rape and published a notice in the newspaper declaring their engagement. He also attempted to force sixteen-year-old female classmates Pan Chunjun and Zhu Guo to rape, causing Pan to develop severe heart disease. The students were extremely angry and signed a petition for help on the 20th, which was submitted to the Dongda Student Autonomous Association. Only on the 22nd, they, together with the police, arrested Lu and five others. In addition, several others have been placed under surveillance by Dongda students. It is said that this case is very complicated, with non-student elements involved. The students are rectifying the internal affairs and will make a statement to avoid affecting their reputation.</p>
<h3 id="e111">Changzhou's Grain Official Lawsuit - Morning Glories Bloom Everywhere! <a href="#e111" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c111" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">111</a></h3>

<p>Wu Zhihui Seeks Justice for a Good Person - Lu Pinjin's Confused Account</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Wujin, 21st Dispatch] The Changzhou Grain Office's corruption case, involving the sale of grain, transportation for external processing, and collusion with grain merchants, a series of cases, has developed to the point where more and more problems are emerging, just like morning glories, blooming one after another, which is really impressive. Lu Pinjin is one of the main characters. After fleeing to Hangzhou, he sent a confused account from Weng Ren's account at the inn to the Grain Office by post. All payment bills only had a seal "翁　," and the deputy director, section chief, and accountant were all blank, which also means that they are not responsible, and all responsibility is borne by Weng Cheng.</p>
<p>Wu Zhilao believes that the Grain Office's corruption case has implicated a good person, Wu Shuchun, from the Caoqiao Office in a lawsuit, while the主管长官 (zhuguan zhangguan) (responsible official) is still at large, expressing unlimited emotion. He wrote a letter to Senator Xue Digong, hoping that the Senate would seek justice for him impartially.</p>
<p>Jin Zhenyi, the manager of the Hengji Rice Mill, runs his factory in the same way as Tianfeng. He was originally a shareholder of Tianfeng and also Tianfeng's guarantor. He embezzled more than 1,400 dan of grain. Jin is now a senator and has recently started a Minsheng Daily. The county government is handling his matter very seriously, and finally had to summon him to pursue the recovery of the grain. He was soon released on bail to handle the matter. Unexpectedly, after Jin was released on bail, he fled without a trace. Several guarantors were fooled. Each guarantor is responsible for compensating 400 dan of grain. The county government once summoned the guarantors. The guarantors explained the process of acting as guarantors, which was just like a scam. Now that they have been hooked, they have nowhere to complain, and they have to find another guarantor. Guarantor guarantees guarantor, this was originally Jin Zhenyi's good play. Jin Zhenyi sent a letter to his friend from Shanghai, saying: The case is not over, I do not intend to return for the time being!</p>
<h3 id="e112">Agriculture Zhejiang's Call Enters the Concretization Stage - 25 Counties Set Up Demonstration Zones <a href="#e112" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c112" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">112</a></h3>
<p>— Our Special Correspondent Chu Yusheng</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Hangzhou, 22nd Dispatch] Recently, there is good news in Zhejiang, that is, the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization has taken a fancy to Zhejiang Province. They, together with the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry and the Provincial Government, are preparing to build Zhejiang into an ideal agricultural demonstration province.</p>
<p>Zhejiang Province, this famous and prosperous region, if evaluated by the current standards, it is gradually declining, because now is the era of science, and the most important thing is of course industry, and agriculture must also use mechanization for production, so that it can reach the modern economic level. Unfortunately, our Zhejiang has no industrial foundation by nature - not many mineral deposits, and even fewer coal deposits. Agricultural production is still entirely dependent on the hard work of farmers plowing the land bit by bit and harvesting grain by grain. The production method in Zhejiang Province is actually the old set from hundreds of years ago. Its name of "prosperity" is only inherited from the reputation left by its ancestors. As for rural side businesses, the famous silk and tea have also been ridiculed by foreign markets due to the lack of improvement in production methods, becoming a declining door.</p>
<p>Standing on the land of Zhejiang, we look forward to the future of Zhejiang. In fact, only the revitalization of agriculture is possible. The vast plains of Hangzhou, Jiaxing, and Huzhou, the Qiantang River, the Fuchun River, the Puyang River, and the Cao'e River can irrigate the rich lands far and near. The natural landscape has already made it an agricultural region, not to mention the mulberry trees and tea forests everywhere, which is really a great land of fish and rice!</p>
<p>In 1946, the Sino-US joint agricultural technology investigation team traveled all over the country. In the plan they formulated, one of the most important points was to set up an agricultural demonstration zone. The location of the demonstration zone was actually selected in Zhejiang. Two years of negotiations have made this demonstration zone concrete. Therefore, the Minister of Agriculture and Forestry, together with the key负责人 (fuzeren) (person in charge) of the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization, came to Hangzhou to formulate a more concrete plan. According to a负责人 (fuzeren) (person in charge) in the Agricultural Organization, they brought this time to see whether the local government is determined to do this business. After several talks, they felt satisfied, so they agreed to jointly form the Zhejiang Provincial Agricultural Promotion Committee, and decided to set up seven委负 (wei fu) (committee members), and first use 25 counties as demonstration zones, with the United Nations allocating 86 billion, the Zhejiang Provincial Government 30 billion, and the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry 15 billion. I went to ask Gong Peicheng, the Director of the Construction Department of Zhejiang Province, and learned that the address of the demonstration zone has been selected in Hangzhou, Jiaxing, Huzhou, Ningbo, Shaoxing, and Jinhua areas. The 86 billion from the United Nations can be remitted immediately. After the remittance, it is strongly requested to purchase physical objects, which has also been agreed to by Chen Baolin, the Director of the Finance Department. The 30 billion from Zhejiang Province was also approved at the Provincial Government meeting on July 22.</p>
<p>The scope of their business, the first step is to increase production, according to the performance of various lands, plant various grains suitable for the performance of the land, and other departments will slowly start to do it. Talking about increasing production, there are many related problems, such as the construction of water conservancy, the distribution of increased value of agricultural land harvest, the lending of farmers' seed capital, etc. According to Hangzhou, Jiaxing, Huzhou, Ningbo, Shaoxing, Jinhua and other regions, the north of Hangzhou, Jiaxing and Huzhou has Taihu Lake, and there are many ports in the territory, which is a natural water town. Ningbo and Shaoxing regions have the Cao'e River running through them, especially Ningbo has Dongqian Lake for irrigation, and the Jinhua region is surrounded by Puyang River and Jinhua River, which is of course easier to achieve water conservancy. However, the Cao'e River, Puyang River, and Jinhua River have only been slightly dredged in recent years, and no major projects have been done. In Hangzhou, Jiaxing, and Huzhou areas, water is drawn using the old methods of human and cattle power, which cannot save labor and be used for other purposes. Therefore, if we want to increase production, we must carefully investigate irrigation and water conservancy, and the ones that should be dredged should be dredged immediately, and the ones that should be changed to water pumps should be changed to water pumps urgently, so that we can harvest the practical effects of the natural geographical advantages.</p>
<p>Regarding the lending of farmers' seeds and capital, we have become accustomed to the government lending agricultural loans every year, and some agricultural loans are issued during the autumn harvest, and some agricultural loans have not reached the hands of farmers at all, and have been intercepted by general disguised fake farmer organizations for other transactions. In today's rural areas, there are still many new local tyrants. These new local tyrants ask the government representatives to demand high prices for farmers, and implement oppression on farmers. The reporter has entered the rural areas of Jiaxing and they told me that there are still people who borrow high-interest loans for farming, and they have to repay these high-interest loans with physical objects, borrowing one and repaying three, equivalent to borrowing an egg and repaying a chicken's harsh exploitation. Therefore, if we want to lend seeds and capital to farmers, we should go deep into the countryside, visit households one by one, and actually lend them, so that the benefits can be truly given to the farmers.</p>
<p>Regarding the distribution of increased value of agricultural land harvest, the reporter is willing to specially emphasize this point, because the distribution of agricultural land harvest is often the landlord, tenant, and government. Now, the increased value of agricultural land harvest is naturally coveted by the landlords. They will try their best to occupy the largest part, so we must plan ahead before the event, so as not to cause disputes in the future. The messenger believes that the Agricultural Promotion Committee is purely for the promotion and improvement of nature, hoping that this time the harvest will increase in value, and the next time the harvest will increase in value even more, hoping that the harvest will increase in value here, and the harvest will also increase in value elsewhere, so the government has the intention of rewarding farmers for increasing production. If the government occupies a very large part of the increased value of the harvest, then the farmers will feel that they have worked hard for nothing, and naturally they will become passive. Therefore, even if the government wants to collect the increased value, it should also be a small number in the percentage, and the landlord should have no right to intervene. According to Sun Yat-sen's principle of people's livelihood of equal land rights, it shows that the increased value of land has nothing to do with the landlord. We are still in such a situation today because we are favoring landlords and have not truly implemented the principle of people's livelihood. Therefore, after this grain production increase, the increased value of the harvest should not be distributed to the landlord, so that the tenant farmers or self-cultivating farmers will get the greatest benefit, and farmers in all places will follow suit, then in less than five or six years, Zhejiang's agriculture will not be as bad as it is today.</p>
<p>We believe that in addition to increasing production, the Zhejiang Provincial Agricultural Promotion Committee will also carry out other things in order, such as the construction of rural roads, the improvement of rural life, and the transformation of agricultural tools. We have endless expectations for this beautiful vision!</p>

<h3 id="e116">Insufficient Supply of Supplementary Materials to Eradicate Smuggling and Black Markets - Partially Open Self-Provided Foreign Exchange - The Import Management Committee is Studying Implementation Details <a href="#e116" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c116" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">116</a></h3>
<p>Huo Baoshu, Chairman of the Import Management Committee, returned to Shanghai from Beijing yesterday morning and immediately convened a meeting. First, Huo reported on the "Application Method for Overseas Chinese Capital and Domestic Deposits Abroad to Invest in Production Enterprises" approved by the Executive Yuan, and immediately exchanged opinions and decided to start drafting implementation details. It will be announced and implemented when the Executive Yuan's order officially arrives. According to reporters, the main purpose of the above method is to partially open self-provided foreign exchange imports. All domestic deposits abroad are limited to those deposited before the end of June 1948, as certified by the bank, while overseas Chinese capital must be certified by our local consulates. As for the types of imported goods, they will not be limited to Annex 1 and Annex 3. Some daily necessities and secondary items in Annex 2, such as rice, cotton, and fertilizers, will also be approved for import in appropriate amounts. Officials commented that the above method is to supplement the shortage of domestic materials and eradicate smuggling and black markets in order to stabilize prices. The government can still absolutely control the quantity and types of imports. As for the quotas for each season in the future, they will not be reduced as a result, so it will not hinder the interests of legitimate importers. After the increase in raw material imports, exports of manufactured goods can be increased, so it is believed that the above method is absolutely beneficial.</p>
<h3 id="e117">Faltering and Soft Shanghai Stock Market, Slightly Firm Towards the Close <a href="#e117" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c117" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">117</a></h3>
<p>For most of yesterday, the Shanghai stock market was not optimistic. The two trillion production loan, granted to various Shijie Datong bookstores, had already been released. This, coupled with a significant outflow of funds from the national banks for exchanges, led to a recovery, with prices rebounding slightly towards the close.</p>
<p>Opening prices reflected concerns, and most stocks saw declines. Wing On Textile opened at 11,250 yuan. Numbers 69, 224, 65, 180, and 171 took advantage of the low prices to absorb shares, briefly pushing the price up to 11,540 yuan. However, tight credit conditions led to selling by numbers 71, 143, 61, 173, and 60, causing the price to fall back to 11,150 yuan. Slight replenishment by numbers 158, 205, 76, and 71 led to a modest rise to 11,320 yuan. Numbers 065, 179, 207, and 150 sold, breaking the 11,000 yuan barrier. Numbers 160, 173, 97, and 4 bought in, pushing the price back up to 11,170 yuan. However, as the news of the decline in cotton cloth emerged, many short sellers, pressed for time, led by numbers 220, 207, 95, 20, 171, 221, 54, and 169, collectively unloaded their positions. The Shanghai Commercial &amp; Savings Bank underwear shares even hit the daily limit down, falling as low as 10,750 yuan, closing the morning session at 10,800 yuan. Besides the Shanghai Mei Lin Company and Union Land shares hitting the daily limit up, and the slightly rising Datong and Hengfeng shares, the Wuhua shares were positively affected by the Zeng Yan affair, rising by half a percent. Except for the steady Sinyi shares, the remaining stocks generally declined by half a percent to one percent.</p>
<p>The afternoon market opened at 11,500 yuan. Numbers 180 and 205 advanced to 11,800 yuan. Numbers 95, 130, 76, 155, 154, 148, 97, 163, 197, 55, and 11 all closed their positions, causing the price to fall to 11,300 yuan. Then, with over two trillion yuan in funds released by the national banks, numbers 179, 193, 145, 176, 205, 152, 89, 196, 102, and 169 collectively absorbed shares, pushing the price up to 11,920 yuan at closing. The remaining stocks also generally rose. Wuhua Weaving finally hit the daily limit up, as did Mei Lin. Compared to the morning close, Wuhua, Mei Lin, and Hengfeng all hit the daily limit up, Datong and Match suffered small declines, China Silk, Shanghai Commercial, Franco-China, Tongyi, and Rongfeng saw small gains, Jinglun was steady, and the rest generally rose by half a percent to one percent. Over-the-counter, unlisted stocks were lackluster.</p>
<p>Government Bonds</p>
<p>Yesterday, the bond market showed weakness. Series C bonds opened at 1.04 million, falling from 1.08 million to close at 970,000. Runde and number 360 sold, while numbers 500 and 552 bought. Over four million yuan worth of bonds were traded. Compared to the previous close, Series A, B, D, and E bonds were each down 100,000 yuan, and Series C bonds were down 90,000 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e118">Easing Credit Conditions, Over Two Trillion Released by Banks <a href="#e118" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c118" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">118</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, credit conditions in Shanghai eased. The four banks, two bureaus, and one treasury experienced a large net outflow in the exchange of bills among the banking and money exchange firms, due to the submission of previously issued cashier's checks for exchange. The total outflow reached 2.3475 trillion yuan. Among them, the Central Bank alone accounted for the largest outflow, with 2.2673 trillion yuan. The Bank of China had an outflow of 667.2 billion yuan, the Bank of Communications had a net inflow of 585.2 billion yuan, the Farmers Bank of China had an outflow of 194.8 billion yuan, the Central Trust of China had a net inflow of 9.2 billion yuan, the Postal Savings Bureau had an outflow of 36.4 billion yuan, and the Central Cooperative Treasury had a net inflow of 223.8 billion yuan.

<h3 id="e119">Financial Management Bureau Strictly Investigates Bad Checks Issued by Banks and Shops <a href="#e119" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c119" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">119</a></h3>
<p>[Our Report] In coordination with policies to suppress price inflation, the Shanghai Financial Management Bureau has, since the end of June, been strictly cracking down on the practice of banks and shops issuing bad checks. It is understood that the Bureau, based on inspections and daily reports of bounced checks from the clearing house, has since June 30th disciplined 119 customers who issued bad checks with relatively minor violations by ordering the banks and shops to cease doing business with them. For the 46 customers with more serious offenses involving bounced checks, the Bureau has not only ordered the banks and shops to cease doing business with them, but has also instructed the banks and shops to report them to the court. The Bureau will continue to vigorously pursue investigations in the future in order to correct the bad habit of issuing bad checks.</p>
<h3 id="e120">National Bank Stipulates Exchange Measures for Excess Foreign Currency Carried by Entering Passengers <a href="#e120" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c120" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">120</a></h3>
<p>[Our Report] Regarding the amount of foreign currency carried by incoming passengers, and how to exchange the portion exceeding the limit, a person in charge of the Central Bank stated yesterday:</p>
<p>"Foreign currency carried by incoming passengers, beyond the limit of US$100 (or its equivalent in other foreign currency) that passengers may freely carry, should be presented to the Bank on the same day for exchange into national currency at the official exchange rate, or be handed over to the Customs for safekeeping. The safekeeping period is six months. If the passenger is still unable to leave the country after the expiration date and thus unable to claim the currency, the Customs will transfer it to the Bank on the expiration date and convert it into national currency at the exchange rate of the day following the expiration date, awaiting the passenger to come to the Bank to collect it. The Customs will fill out a voucher for the exchange of foreign currency notes and issue it to the passenger, so that the passenger can use this voucher to collect the national currency from the Bank's foreign currency section, but the payment will not be calculated at the exchange rate at the time of collection. As for various foreign currencies that cannot be exchanged, they should also be handed over to the Bank for safekeeping, awaiting the passenger to come to the Bank with the voucher issued by the Customs to collect them. There is no confiscation. Regarding the above-mentioned funds that have been converted into national currency awaiting collection, and the various foreign currencies that cannot be exchanged and are being kept in safekeeping, we hope that those who have not yet collected them will bring their Customs vouchers to the Bank to collect them."</p>
<h3 id="e121">Sino-Farmers Bank to Pay for Wheat Flour Purchases, Payments to Begin Yesterday <a href="#e121" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c121" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">121</a></h3>
<p>The Ministry of Food has entrusted the Trust Department of the China Farmers Bank with the purchase of 500,000 bags of wheat flour in two batches. It was originally planned that 74 flour mills would undertake the production, but it is now reported that 6 manufacturers are unable to participate due to various reasons, with Fuxin undertaking the largest amount at 120,000 bags, followed by Fufeng at 50,000 bags, and Maoxin at 30,000 bags. Payments for the two batches of wheat flour purchased began yesterday, based on 90% of the market price of 12 million yuan per bag of "Silk Soldier" flour from the day before, which is 10.8 million yuan. One-tenth of this amount, 1.08 million yuan per bag, has been paid, for a total expenditure of 540 billion yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e122">Abundant Supply Leads to Selling by Retail Investors, Cotton Yarn and Cloth Prices Both Decline <a href="#e122" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c122" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">122</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the cotton yarn market declined due to the upcoming allocation period of the Textile Construction Company, and prices were lowered. The market supply was abundant, and credit conditions suddenly tightened, resulting in sluggish sales. The local market took a wait-and-see approach, and retail investors began to sell. 42-count Blue Phoenix fine yarn initially opened at 1.7 billion yuan, but due to weak buying interest, those constrained by funds were forced to sell, and the price immediately fell by 50 million yuan. However, the reweaving industry absorbed some, stabilizing the market, and it finally closed at 1.64 billion yuan, a decrease of 60 million yuan compared to the previous day. Throughout the day, except for 10-count coarse yarn, which was slightly stronger, other counts of both coarse and fine yarn saw declines of 50 million to 70-80 million yuan, with only 65 transactions.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the cotton cloth market declined as banks and shops tightened lending, and inspections of treasury stocks were tightened, causing unease. Furthermore, the Textile Construction Company was set to allocate a large quantity of cloth the following day, and supply was abundant. Credit conditions remained tight, and many long positions turned into sellers. Local door sales were sparse, and although merchants from Tianjin and Hankou made inquiries, fellow traders were selling in droves. 12-pound Dragon Head fine cloth immediately declined by 2.2 million yuan at the opening. It briefly rose by 300,000 yuan midway, but rumors of profit-taking spread, and many unloaded at the high, causing it to plummet to 44.35 million yuan before selling. It finally closed at 44.45 million yuan, a decrease of 4.7 million yuan compared to the previous day (with over-the-counter prices falling by another half a percent or so). Other various fine cloth, coarse cloth, fine twill, and serge also experienced significant declines. However, colored cloth, grey cloth, shirting, and foot cloth remained stable. It is reported that 2,540 pieces were traded in the morning.</p>
<p>Also, the price of Dragon Head fine cloth sold by the Textile Construction Company in a bid on the 22nd was 44.88 million yuan, while on the market, there were sales at losses of 3 million to 3.8 million yuan. It was last heard that there was a transaction at a loss of 3.5 million yuan, and the market was showing signs of weakness.</p>
<p>Also, the China Textile Company continued to sell 584 bales of yarn yesterday, recovering 786.9 billion in currency. It also sold 207 bales on behalf of the Yarn Management Committee, amounting to 23,846 million. Yesterday, Xinyu and other four factories purchased 1,400 bundles of cotton, at 280 million per picul, recovering 392 billion in legal tender.</p>
<h3 id="e123">Difficulties in Exporting Tung Oil <a href="#e123" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c123" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">123</a></h3>
<p>Due to unfavorable exchange rates, tung oil exports are difficult. With the current New York delivery price at only 21 US cents per pound, and the Shanghai delivery price at 19.5 cents per pound, converting to a Shanghai price of less than 90 million per picul, it is still impossible to export. It is also learned that the price of Hankou tung oil has also increased due to the rise in exchange rates. After the exchange rate from Shanghai to Hankou increased to only 9.27 billion in Hankou for every 10 billion from Shanghai, the price has also increased to 83 million per picul. When the Hankou exchange rate was at its lowest, with Shanghai delivering 10 billion and Hankou paying out 4.87 billion, tung oil was only over 60 million.</p>
<p>Also, tallow is actively being traded. There were also transactions at 160 million for Homu tallow. Soap factories were actively purchasing. According to industry insiders, it is difficult for prices to rise further in the short term, but it is also not easy for them to fall. Sichuan wax is still quoted at 1.2 billion, but there is not much trading.</p>
<h3 id="e124">Sluggish Rice Sales and Weak Prices, Wheat Flour, Grains, Oil Cakes Also Decline Slightly <a href="#e124" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c124" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">124</a></h3>
<p>The rice market lacked the momentum to rise. In the early market, the price was quoted higher by merchants due to the high price in Wuxi, but due to tight credit conditions and sluggish sales, the market fell back later. White Japonica and thin Indica rice closed at the same level as the previous day. Extra-grade Japonica also stood at the original price of 43 million. Milled Indica rice fell by 1 million yuan, and the closing was extremely soft. Yesterday, 5,518 shih of goods were registered to arrive in the North and South markets.</p>
<p>Wheat Flour</p>
<p>The market was sluggish due to the continued tight credit situation. Northern merchants sold off and recalled funds, resulting in a sharp decline in the market. Old-brand flour opened at 11.7 million and closed even lower at 11.2 million. "Silk Soldier" flour closed at 10.2 million, and Jiancheng, Red Bee, and others all closed down by 1.4 million to 1.5 million yuan. Wheat bran was down by 300,000-400,000 yuan. In the afternoon, small bags of wheat bran were 6.35 million, and factory prices opened at 15 million.</p>
<p>Grains</p>
<p>There was a general decline due to tight credit conditions, forcing merchants to sell. The market was particularly weak. Soybeans fell by 1 million, and spring broad beans closed at 16 million. Broad beans also fell by 1 million. Corn and buckwheat were purchased by Qingdao merchants, falling by 2 million. Mung beans were firm in the early market but fell by 1-2 million at the close. Sorghum sales were very sluggish, and the market was weak. Sesame was stable due to purchases by Tianjin merchants. Raw peanuts were slightly weak.</p>
<p>Edible Oil</p>
<p>Continuing the weakness of the previous day, there was a further decline, due to tight credit conditions, with both factories and retailers selling off. Soybean oil was traded at 76 million in the early market and fell further to 74 million at the close, a decrease of 6 million. Rapeseed oil also fell by 5-6 million yuan. Jiton rapeseed oil fell into the 100 million range, down 4 million, and was traded at 98 million. Small-scale sesame oil initially opened at 86 million, but was re-raised to 88 million due to Tianjin merchants purchasing, a slight decrease of 2 million. Soybean cake ultimately fell by 300,000-400,000.</p>
<h3 id="e125">Galvanized Iron Wire and Nails Rise Sharply <a href="#e125" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c125" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">125</a></h3>
<p>Coiled wire and raw silk prices are also high.</p>
<p>The price of galvanized iron wire and nails has risen significantly this year. In February, each barrel was only 4-5 million, but as of now, it has reached around 100 million, and the retail price is as high as 1.2-1.3 million per catty. This is even more dramatic than for Dragon Head fine cloth or solid soap. However, most of the galvanized iron wire and nails sold in the market are manufactured by Shanghai factories. There are now dozens of large and small factories. Because the equipment is relatively simple, small factories can produce with just a nail-making machine, while large factories need to have wire-drawing machines and nail-rolling machines. However, the raw materials, coiled wire and raw silk, have also been very expensive recently, so the cost of raw materials is over 80 million.</p>
<h3 id="e126">Market Conditions in Various Locations <a href="#e126" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c126" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">126</a></h3>

<p>[Our Report] The Social Education Department of the Municipal Education Bureau yesterday released an overview of the People's School management in the city, stating: "At the beginning of the victory and restoration, the Bureau immediately paid attention to promoting people's education and eliminating illiteracy, in order to meet the needs of implementing democratic politics. Based on the revised People's School Regulations issued by the Ministry, the Bureau formulated the Shanghai Municipal People's School Establishment Measures. Due to objective limitations, only simple and economical methods could be adopted. People's School buildings are borrowed from private primary and secondary schools, and the original school principal serves as the honorary principal, without pay, and is responsible for assisting in the promotion. In addition, the Bureau appoints a director to be solely responsible for administrative guidance and promotion work. It is stipulated that each school should have at least three classes, but may be increased as needed depending on local needs. The director serves concurrently as a class teacher, and one full-time teacher is assigned for every two classes, or one part-time teacher is assigned for each class, mostly selected from the teachers of the school. To date, 150 People's Schools have been established, with a total of 697 classes. Their distribution is based on the principle of balanced development in the suburban districts. In addition, most social education institutions have affiliated People's Schools and encourage schools at all levels to run People's Schools concurrently, in order to accelerate the promotion of People's Education.</p>

<h3 id="e135">Academic Institution Special Interview: Lixin Accounting College <a href="#e135" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c135" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">135</a></h3>
<p>Brief History</p>
<p>In the spring of the 17th year of the Republic of China (1928), Pan Xulun founded the Lixin Accounting Tutoring School. Later, realizing that the school's approach focused too much on solving occupational problems, and desiring to fulfill the mission of improving accounting, he believed that establishing an accounting college was essential. Thus, in the spring of the 26th year of the Republic of China (1937), he actively prepared to establish an accounting college, inviting Chen Qizhu, Wang Yunwu, Song Hanzhang, Qian Yongming, Jiang Hengyuan, and accountants from the Lixin Accounting Firm at the time, including Qian Naizheng, Li Wenjie, and Li Hongshou, to form the board of directors, raising a fund of 170,000 yuan. In April of the same year, the board of directors was formally established, with Chen Qicai and Wang Yunwu elected as chairman and vice-chairman, and Pan Xulun as president. In May, the board of directors submitted a report to the Ministry of Education for record, and in July, permission to open the school was granted. Just as the enrollment examination was completed, the August 13th Incident (Battle of Shanghai) began, hindering school affairs. Subsequently, as the war moved westward and order gradually returned to Shanghai, permission was granted in the summer of the 28th year of the Republic of China (1939) to enroll new students, with the new semester beginning on September 1st. In March of the 29th year of the Republic of China (1940), land was purchased in Xujiahui, Shanghai, with the intention of constructing permanent school buildings once the war ended. In February of the 30th year of the Republic of China (1941), the Ministry of Education approved the school's registration, and in July, the first class of students graduated. In December, the Pacific War broke out, and Shanghai fell. In the autumn of the following year, the school moved to Beibei, Sichuan. In the 32nd year of the Republic of China (1943), Lixin Building was established in Chongqing, with permission to add a city class. In August of the 34th year of the Republic of China (1945), the Anti-Japanese War was won, and the school returned to Shanghai. The Beibei and Chongqing colleges ceased enrolling new students, continuing to operate until all classes graduated.</p>
<p>Current Situation</p>
<p>The school is currently divided into two parts: boarding students on Xuhong Road and commuting students on Changle Road, with a total of 836 students. The professors hired include Li Zhaohuan, Chen Guyuan, Pan Xulun, Wu Benzhong, Wang Guanqing, and others, many of whom are well-known scholars.</p>
<p>The school will enroll first-year, first-semester students in the autumn of the 37th year of the Republic of China (1948). The examination will be held on July 25th, and registration will be accepted from the 19th until the day before the examination, either in person or by written application to the Admissions Committee at 466 Lane, Changle Road, Shanghai, or 213 Zhongshan Road, Nanjing.</p>

<p>Current Situation</p>
<p>The school is currently divided into two departments: engineering and commerce. The engineering department temporarily has a mechanical engineering major, while the commerce department has three majors: accounting, banking, and business administration, with both day and evening classes.

<p>[Reuters, Uxbridge World Games Camp, 22nd] The Chinese World Games soccer team arrived in England after a long journey, still in high spirits. They arrived in London this afternoon from Calcutta. After resting for an afternoon, they will actively begin training on the morning of the 23rd. Coach Li Huitang expressed hope to first play several friendly matches with other national teams, including the US and Korean teams. Li said, "Currently, we know nothing about the strength of other teams. I believe that after several days and several friendly matches, we can know how our own strength compares to other teams." The Chinese soccer team is very strong, with six players from the Singapore team who came to England last year. Team leader Dr. Rong Qizhao is confident that the World Games team is far stronger than the Singapore team. They gained a lot of experience during the 35 matches played along the way from China to England. In these 35 matches, they won 25, drew 5, and lost 5. Furthermore, all members of the Chinese World Games team will move from the Uxbridge camp to the dormitory in a school near Wembley Stadium on the 23rd.</p>

<p>[Reuters, London, 22nd] It is widely rumored here that the final leg of the Olympic torch relay to Wembley Stadium before the opening ceremony of the World Games on the 29th will be carried out by the British Prince Consort, the Duke of Edinburgh. Although this has not been confirmed, many people feel that it would be most appropriate for the Duke of Edinburgh to carry out the final leg, as the Prince Consort was originally a brave athlete and was originally from Greece, which is in line with the traditional spirit of the Olympics. The World Games Organizing Committee is keeping the selection of the person to carry the final leg of the torch relay a closely guarded secret, but it is known that the selection has already been made internally. If the Duke of Edinburgh is selected, it must be approved by King George VI of England.</p>

<h3 id="e150">Summary of the Yang Mei Case <a href="#e150" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c150" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">150</a></h3>
<p>— Wu Yong</p>
<p>The strange case of Yang Mei's fasting began in mid-May of this year. I regret that I have not been able to practice abstinence from grains. The old newspapers of that month have already been sold for rice, so the exact date cannot be found. However, according to a report on June 1, the case had been "under investigation for 21 days," so the beginning of the strange case should have been on May 9. I have always advocated the principle of loyalty and forgiveness, holding the belief that "everyone should have food to eat," and have no ambition to ask others to starve in order to complete a personal mission, so I was initially not interested in this strange case of fasting. It was not until early June that the matter seemed to alarm the authorities and entered an extremely "subtle" stage that I became solemn and began to carefully study the various news related to the case. Here is a summary for the reference of later scholars.</p>
<p>According to my impression, before June, the strange case of fasting seemed to be limited to the so-called "research" of several doctors in a private capacity. It was not until June 2 that: "The Yang Mei test work decided to establish a 'Technical Committee,' divided into 'Clinical' and 'Research' groups. After the Health Bureau determines the candidates for each group, the next step of Yang Mei's examination can be carried out." Using "political methods" to deal with "scientific" problems, that's how it started. Following this, many people published grand theories, which can be summarized into three major categories: (1) conjecture; (2) advocating research; (3) hoping to obtain results as soon as possible. However, they were not very interested in on-site research.</p>
<p>The newspaper reported on June 6: "Hu Wenxian said: The cause of this mysterious fasting must be found as soon as possible to avoid confusing public opinion." On the same day, the newspaper reported: "The Ministry of Health has not yet issued any instructions on the Yang Mei fasting incident. The Health Bureau has recently submitted a report on the observation of the past three weeks to the Medical Administration Department of the Ministry of Health." The official document began its journey.</p>
<p>The newspaper reported on June 8: The case "caused a sensation in the United States, and American experts will fly to Chongqing."</p>
<p>The newspaper reported on June 10: "Zhang Qun inquired about the Yang Mei incident in great detail and felt it was important. Yang Sen also intends to negotiate with the central government to allocate huge funds to set up a research institution." I just don't know if this "institution" under preparation is the "Technical Committee" presided over by the Health Bureau, which has already been divided into "Clinical" and "Research" groups? The newspaper reported on the same day: "According to a nurse, Yang Mei farts."</p>
<p>The newspaper reported on June 11: "Pharmacist Fan Daoan believes: There may be chlorophyll in the body." This is probably taking the "person" with a round head and square feet as a "plant."</p>
<p>The newspaper reported on June 13: "Li Zhiyu (Director of the Chongqing Health Bureau) has not actively carried out the preparation of the institution for the next step of Yang Mei's examination." The difficulty lies in not knowing "where to start," because "Yang Sen is interested in this matter," but "his specific methods have not yet been clearly expressed." "Therefore, apart from deciding to establish a technical committee at a meeting, there has been no news of further discussion." Director Li "has shown a worried and anxious expression."</p>
<p>The newspaper reported on June 16: "Yang Mei said she wanted to go home. Mayor Yang Sen asked her why. She replied: After returning home, she can sell a chicken and a pig to buy cloth for sewing clothes." It is said that the mayor felt this was very "unique." Mayor Yang also emphasized that "Yang Mei is no longer privately owned by any individual. She has become the research object of scientists all over the world."</p>
<p>The newspaper reported on June 17: "Hospital director Hu Wenxian, who is in charge of Yang Mei's test work, published insightful views on Yang Mei's problem: Where her excrement is hidden is still a mystery, and he advocates studying her urine." Why doesn't he study it directly, but still has to "advocate" it? It doesn't sound like the tone of someone in charge of the test work.</p>
<p>The newspaper reported on June 18: "A Yang Mei appeared in Shanghai."</p>
<p>The radio broadcast on June 26: "Yang Mei has become a puppet." After that, there was no news of this case.</p>
<p>It was not until July 19 that "Yang Mei's Riddle" was "completely unraveled." According to reports: From July 3 to July 15, Yang Mei ate the following foods during these thirteen days: porridge, salted soybeans, white sugar, rice, mashed soybeans, grain husks, potatoes, braised pork, etc. It was also said that she has returned to Jiulongpo. This case caused a sensation throughout the country, lasted for 70 days, and came to an end. Imported rice is still necessary.</p>
<p>Conclusion: In the future, there will inevitably be figures like Renoir coming to China to explore, and its nature is similar to exploring Africa.</p>
<h3 id="e151">On Teacher Certification <a href="#e151" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c151" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">151</a></h3>
<p>— Yi Jun</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Education has begun to conduct teacher certification again. First to start is the certification for national school teachers. Before long, it is thought that the certification of middle school teachers, teachers of normal schools, and social educators will be held too. This is indeed a very important matter.</p>
<p>A teacher is a role model for children and youth, and even the general public. They shoulder the sacred mission of cultivating the nation's young sprouts, inspiring national wisdom, and transforming national habits. How can just anyone with a round head and square feet be qualified to be a teacher? Deciding whether a person has the qualifications and conditions to be a teacher is extremely important. Therefore, conducting teacher certification is a very necessary thing.</p>
<p>However, there is one point here (a very important point) that needs to be pointed out specifically: "Education" is not entirely equivalent to "teaching." Teaching is only part of the work of education. In the past (and perhaps in the future), when conducting teacher certification, only the applicant's academic qualifications and experience were used as standards, while character cultivation and physical condition were not asked about at all. This is an extremely serious mistake!</p>
<p>In reality, certification like this cannot be called "teacher" certification, but only "teaching craftsman" certification. A person who is qualified to be a teaching craftsman is not necessarily qualified to be a teacher. Look at those who open cram schools, those who rape female students, those who fraudulently claim rations, and those who make unreasonable demands. Are these the behaviors of "teachers"? Is our society not bad enough that we have to ask these people to "set an example"?</p>
<p>Therefore, when conducting teacher certification in the future, it is imperative to take into account the virtue, intelligence, and physical condition of the applicants, and not to be ambiguous about it at all.</p>
<p>Finally, I would like to say a few words outside of this topic, which is: When holding teacher summer seminars, we must not only focus on discussions of teaching methods and techniques, but also emphasize the cultivation of character as an even more important matter.</p>
<p>"Teacher" should be a person of such noble, upright, and promising character!</p>
<h3 id="e152">Chen Shaobai and Shi Jingran <a href="#e152" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c152" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">152</a></h3>
<p>— Danlin</p>
<p>Chen Shaobai, in the early days of the National Revolution, was one of the "Four Bandits" of revolutionary comrades, along with Sun Yat-sen, Yang Heling, and You Lie. He was also one of the earliest to engage in revolutionary propaganda. Thirteen years before the founding of the Republic of China, he founded the China Daily in Hong Kong.</p>
<p>In the revolutionary movement, Chen shared ideals and aspirations with Shi Jingran, the third sister of martyr Shi Jianru, and the two were deeply in love. Regarding Ms. Shi's life, Chen mentioned it in "A Separate Record of the History of the Xingzhonghui Revolution," saying: "... While Jingran was gentle, meticulous, exceptionally intelligent, and especially decisive. Therefore, whenever Jianru had matters, he would discuss them with Jingran, and Gu Yu (referring to Jianru's elder brother) was sometimes not informed. At that time, a Japanese man named Takahashi Ken was a teacher at a certain school in Guangzhou. Jianru, through his introduction, went to Hong Kong to see Mr. Chen (referring to Shaobai) and subsequently joined the Xingzhonghui. Jingran was also a most enthusiastic person for the revolution, but because her actions were not free, she could not fully carry out her intentions. Therefore, it would not be wrong to say that Jianru's joining the association was Jingran's proxy... Jingran lived with her mother in Macau. When Jianru met with misfortune, Jingran endured the pain and hid it from her mother, scratching out all the records of Jianru's affairs in the newspapers, and forging false information to present to her mother, claiming that Jianru had gone to Luzon... Two years later, at the urging of Ms. Zhang Zhujun (Ms. Zhang is currently residing in Shanghai), Jingran changed her name and went to Guangzhou to run a girls' school. Before a month had passed, she contracted cholera and died within two days."</p>
<p>Jingran passed away at the young age of twenty-two. Chen was deeply saddened by the premature deaths of her and her brother, who were both ardent revolutionaries with unfulfilled ambitions. He also lamented that he and Jingran were already engaged, but had not yet consummated their marriage, and the two had been suddenly separated. Both publicly and privately, he felt endless grief and sorrow. When Ms. Shi's remains were buried in the church cemetery in Sanwanggang, the eastern suburbs of Guangzhou, Chen personally wrote an epitaph for her tombstone, to be preserved as a permanent memorial. The inscription reads: "Heroic ambition, three feet of cold stone. The latecomer should close his eyes, you sit in your dwelling. The national soul desires to be restored, the wise man does not return. Our race grieves, the foreign race anticipates. Jade has encompassed the mountain, the sea is difficult to become water. This humble self stumbles, distant is the confidant. The sky is blue, the earth is yellow, spring dew, autumn frost; the ugly captives are not yet destroyed, how can we comfort the wounds of our nation! Born in 1881, died in 1902, aged twenty-two."</p>
<p>This text does not use many words, but it is mournful and beautiful, and its sentiments are tender and moving. Reading it, one cannot help but have thoughts of heroic figures. In the course of the revolutionary movement, this is a tragic and magnificent historical material.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Feng Ziyou's "A History of the Revolution Before the Founding of the Republic of China" says of Ms. Shi: "Jianru had a younger sister named Jingran, who was well-versed in the revolution and helped her brother Jianru in his revolutionary endeavors. It is said that after martyr Jianru died, two years later, Ms. Jingran passed away. Neither Jianru nor Jingran were married. Gu Yu died of consumption after the founding of the Republic of China. Shi's mother passed away last, enjoying a life of over ninety years. Having witnessed the death and separation of her flesh and blood, she never said a word of complaint. She even regarded it as a regret that her children were unable to contribute more to the country. This was a very rare and virtuous mother, and it is worth mentioning in passing."</p>
<h3 id="e153">Wang Tao's Hand-Annotated Books <a href="#e153" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c153" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">153</a></h3>
<p>— Qian Dacheng</p>
<p>Recent people who talk about Wang Tao, the Hermit of Tiannan, are quite numerous, with some calling him the "Taiping Scholar," but there is no definite evidence for this. However, this man was overflowing with talent and unwilling to be lonely, and there are many strange anecdotes about him. Looking at his writings and calligraphy, they all deviate from the orthodox path, and he is truly the founder of the "Shanghai School of Literature"! Two years ago, I spent five thousand yuan at the Baicheng Bookstore in Suzhou to obtain his hand-annotated four volumes of "Dengchuang Suohua" (Trivial Talks by the Light of a Lamp) by Yu Xinbo (named Yuan, from Xiushui) (a Daoguang Dingwei edition, which, according to Sun Dianqi's "Bookselling Jottings," should have ten volumes; this copy is incomplete, but Tao was unaware of this), which bore various collectors' seals, such as "Wang Tao's Private Seal," "Ziquan," "Once Collected by Wang Tao," and "Old Glutton of Wuxia." There was also a hand-written postscript, which roughly said: "Yu Xinbo had a tall and strong body, and his head was as big as a five-stone gourd. But his poetry followed the Song dynasty style and was quite delicate. He was an inner-chamber disciple of Jia Jiyu... 'Dengchuang Suohua' is his work on art... When the Taiping rebels went south, you fled in panic, and the printing plates were destroyed by the war. Upon arriving in Shanghai, carrying a letter from a certain prominent figure, he visited the county magistrate Liu Jun Songyan, who suspected it was a forgery and put him in jail, almost leading to disaster; it turned out that Magistrate Liu had been misled by rumors. Although he was later released, he died in poverty. This is also the misfortune of a scholar. Every time I unfold this book, tears well up. In the late fourth month of the summer of Jiashen in the tenth year of Guangxu, I returned from Guangdong and stayed briefly in Spring Shenpu. Written by the Hermit of Tiannan." The words had a sense of shared suffering. According to recent research, Tao was born in the year of Wuzi in the eighth year of Daoguang of the Qing dynasty, which means that he was fifty-seven years old that year. This book was co-annotated with his wife's younger brother, Yang Xingbu, and there are many laughable points in their comments. For example, the original book contained a poem about gu-sao bing (sister-in-law cakes), which said: "For ten years, the unmarried aunt will grow old, for five nights, the widowed sister-in-law cries alone; the Qingnv and Su'e are both cold-resistant (using a line), one ball of bright moon, one ball of frost." Xing Lian first commented, "According to ritual, widows do not cry at night." Tao commented after him, "This comment by Xingbu is extremely pedantic! A widow's poem has the line 'Five watches are like passing through five heavy barriers.' I wonder how Xingbu would interpret this?" This is similar to the content of recent Shanghai erotic publications, and frivolous writing was pioneered by Tao? In his later years, Tao still enjoyed visiting brothels, but he was restrained by his wife. In a letter to a friend, he described his plight, saying: "The world is not lacking in beautiful women, but in my boudoir, there remains only a plain woman. Although the position is vacant, it is still set up. The zither is in the imperial presence but not played. Occasionally, in my leisure time, I accompany two or three like-minded friends, carrying wine to see the flowers, but this is merely for entertainment, and restrictions follow immediately after. Every short step is hindered, and thorns grow. A moment of joy cannot match a thousand words of scolding. Every inch of sky and foot of land is constrained. This is truly a suffering being in the dusty sea... " He spoke in detail and was not ashamed. Later, he even came to Wumen alone, calling himself a "runaway from his wife." However, his literary talent and elegance shone through an era. Books like "Songyin Mantan" were in everyone's hands, and people like Hu Shi repeatedly corroborated his year of death. Is this also searching for the hidden and acting strangely, so that later generations have something to recount?</p>

<p>— Shi Shufan</p>
<p>Met with Ebu, Busanmu, Zihe, and Yuangan in Yilou during the rain. Ebu delights in Chan meditation, and I also stopped drinking, savoring the flavor of emptiness. I have never had such an experience before.</p>
<p>Severe heat and rain accompany thunder, the vegetable planter sits unconcerned as his strength wanes. Planting connects heaven and waste, and rejoins the night sea. Who pities the horizontal hardship and pure poems? The light of the mind-source lamp diminishes, and the affairs of the world gradually become clearer. Do not speak of the dreams of fur coats and horses of yesteryear, famous names of books are known everywhere in the Jianghu.</p>
<p>Inkstone Water</p>
<p>The eaves spider idiotically weaves a web before the wind, inkstone water quietly produces June ice. Springing up like a tide, Guan Zhuang's spirit, casually waving a cattail fan to swat mosquitoes.</p>
<p>Washing while sitting in the Milky Way truly becomes waves, mosquito formations break encirclement without needing a knife. Tonight, the landscape of Jiangshan is truly wondrous, the blue sky is like an urn, the bean fence is high.</p>
<h3 id="e155">A Record of Bowl Lotus <a href="#e155" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c155" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">155</a></h3>
<p>— Wang Yunan</p>
<p>My brother-in-law, Mr. Di Yongshang of Liyang, lives in Wu, Suzhou, and has devoted his life to education. He has a passion for flowers. Knowing that I share the same hobby, he presented me with a precious double-tiered bowl lotus and told me that it is commonly known as "bowl fortune." However, what is usually seen is that lotus seeds are cultivated, and the initial blooming is small and representative, suitable for pure offerings on the desk. After a year, the lotus root becomes large, and the bowl cannot contain it, and the flower also resembles a regular lotus. This one is relatively rare, with double petals spreading out, like the lotus seat of a Buddhist disciple, and the lotus seedpod does not produce seeds, with multiple flowers stacked on top of each other, hence the name double-tiered. Cultivation is extremely difficult, requiring watering several times a day, fertilizing regularly, and exposing it to the sun and dew while avoiding strong winds and sudden rain. If it is moved, the direction cannot be changed, or it will not bloom. In winter, it should be properly stored, and uneven dryness or dampness, or frozen soil, will easily rot the lotus root. If properly maintained, the roots can be divided into two pots the following spring. Initially, a certain former Governor of Anhui obtained it from a large monastery in Anhui, carried it back to Suzhou, and cultivated it carefully. He divided it into multiple pots, and when he met someone with the same passion, he was generous in giving away cuttings, but he hoped that they would be carefully taken care of and that the roots could be divided and flowers bloom the following year. Unfortunately, over the years, few have been able to live up to expectations, so this species has become increasingly rare and precious. Only Master Lu of Jinsu Keyuan is skilled in cultivation. Most of those who cultivate this flower in Suzhou entrust it to Keyuan for cultivation, and they take it back for viewing during the flowering season. I live as a guest in Shanghai, relying on the city government, and I am pressed for time every year. The official documents are tiring, and the bustling city sounds are unbearable. Whenever I have free time, I often stroll through the flower market to relieve my boredom, but rare treasures are hard to come by, which makes me feel disappointed. Now, facing the famous flower every day, my troubled heart is cleansed. The initial bud has already bloomed in full, and the next bud is also waiting to bloom. Therefore, I brought it to the industry and shared it with my fellow enthusiasts. I am grateful to Mr. Yu Chuoshuo, the founder of Shen Bao, for providing photography (see picture), and I humbly describe the outline to express my gratitude. [Editor's note: There are double-tiered bowl lotus in my Suzhou home, and I have even seen a double-stemmed one. I wonder how they are this summer. The official documents are tiring, and thinking of this often leaves me feeling lost.]</p>
