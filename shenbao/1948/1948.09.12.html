<h3>物價漲跌幅度已狹小　四聯討論放款對象　截至六日各地收兌金銀外幣統計　值五午六百八十萬美元</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十一日電〕十一日四聯理事會中討論貸款方針及範圍時，翁院長，千財長等發言，均主張貸款應力如緊縮，因以後發行之數字已親定限額，各行局對於貸款務須嚴加審核，以免游資充斥市塲。十一日理事會通過公用交通事業貸款兩筆，首都汽車公司及江南汽車公司申請貸款，各貸給金元券四萬元。</p>
<p>〔本報南京十一日電〕四聯總處十一日上午舉行第三七一次理事會議，翁文灏主席，各理事均出席，首由秘書處報吿改革幣制後各地金融物價變動情形，一般言之，利率均見降低，匯水逐斬趨平，各種物價雖仍略有漲跌，但其幅度已現狹小。又截至本月六日止，根據三獲得之報告，各地共計收兌黃金六十二萬三千餘兩白銀一百三十六萬七千餘兩，銀元六百二十三萬一千餘枚，美鈔一千二百八十七萬元，港幣三千三百零四萬元，同期內進出口外匯凈收入一千二百萬美元，全部共計收入折合美金達五千六百八十萬元。嗣卽討論議案：</p>
<p>一，關於修訂放款對象及方式一案，咸主應就過去規定之：（一）日用必需品生產事業，（二）基本工礦事業，（三）公用交通事業，（四）出口貿易事業等四大類中，從緊選擇對象，並一律以貸予流動資金爲限，本案仍再交硏究，以便詳細明確規定。</p>
<p>二，各行局庫放款計息辦法，前曾由三七〇次理事會核定，自八月廿三日起，最高不得超過月息三分，最近行政院頒布銀行錢莊存放款利率限制辦法，規定不論新舊存放均應自八月廿三日起，改按月息三分之下計息，但下列二項不在此限：（一）八月廿二日以前已到期尙未淸償之工處貸款，准照銀行慣例，另定逾期加息。（二）已貸出之農業貸款，仍照原訂利率收取，但自八月廿三日起，超過月息三分之部份，應由中農行，中合庫另戶存儲，備充改進農民福利之用。</p>
<h3>七千萬美元建設援款　經合即撥付我國　進出口銀行否認閻錫山接洽貸款</h3>
<p>〔中央社華盛頓十日電〕美經濟合作總署署長霍夫曼稱：總署可能於九月下旬將中國分署所通過全中國建設計劃主要部份所需款項，撥予中國。霍氏對總署駐華建設調査團之其他意見及建議則拒予發表。據霍夫曼稱：司徒立門將於週內赴華，而在渠抵華後三十日內，美國七千萬元援華工業建設及補充計劃之主要款項，卽可撥付中國。霍氏並盛譽駐華建設調査團之工作謂：該團已詳細硏究大批可獲經濟合作總署經濟援助之計劃。關於中國之新幣問題，霍氏稱：余尙未接獲駐華代表賴樸翰之報吿，而由於中國目前處境艱難，余更不願對此事作任何批許。霍氏繼稱：經濟合作總署極願中國經濟改革成功，此種改革如獲成功，則對穩定幣制將大見成効，且將使中國復原工作獲得加速淮展。據悉：中國美援運用委會委員嚴家淦，今日再度訪司徒立門晤談。</p>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓十日電〕進出口銀行高級官員，十日否認中國山西省主席閻錫山曾派員向該行接治任何借款之說。據最近報截稱；閻錫山曾要求進出口銀行借款五百萬至一千萬元，以加强山西反共之地位。此間中國大使館亦已正式認爲此項新聞「有疑義」。</p>

<h3>張羣在日發表聲明　強調三點主及早締結和約　自新基礎樹中日未來關係</h3>
<p>〔中央社束京十一日電〕前行政院院長張羣，今日發表聲明，强調下列三點：及早締結日本和約，日本經濟與整個東亞之關係，以及日本成爲和平而民主國家之需要。此項聲明於午後五時十五分向日本人民廣播，茲錄聲明原文如下：</p>
<p>此次本人以個人資格，前來視察戰後日本，承麥帥及盟總各地各級主管的誠意協助，以及日本朝野領袖的坦白報吿，及至本人親往日本各地的耳聞目睹，使我對盟總佔領政策及其實施績效，與夫戰後日本的各種情况，獲得更親切的認識與了解，實感欣慰異常。現在考察吿一段落，預定十二日返國，特就個人觀感所得，略抒所懷，此爲臨別贈言。</p>
<p>戰爭結束倐已三報，在這　短歲月中，更生的日本，竟已在各種制度和法規上，具備了和平民主的模楷，而一般日本國民，也能遵照盟總指示，步步邁進，可說這一切正是說明了麥帥和其同僚們的偉大成就，與日本國民奉公守法的優良性格，實値得我們同聲讚譽的。可是民主政治的眞諦，不僅是在於制度與法規之改革與建立，同時必須是一般國民及領導者，對民主主義思想之澈底的了解和堅定的信仰。而日本政治民主化的艱難，而遙遠的路程又正如一羅馬非一日可成」，更必須日本的先知先覺與一般國民具有自主積極的真摯熱情，與百折不撓的堅忍精神，和衷共濟，携手並進，始克底於成功。本來日本國民由於長期間生息於神道的封建的軍國主義壓榨下，久已缺乏自中進取的民主訓絲，其原有良好的個性，實已被摧殘殆盡，自戰爭失敗惡夢方醒，在盟繼領導下，雖已踏上了再生民主的大道，但因爲時迄尙短暫，還沒能够把握目標勇往躍進，這也是無庸諱言的事實。自我到達日本以來，我曾接觸過各級各地的盟總官員，和其他盟國代表，也曾聽取過日本各界各地的多數領袖的意見，我也曾親自觀察日本各地民衆的家庭生活，與社會生活，我總感覺到有形的制度法規的改造易，而無形的心理思想的改造難，如果日本各界領袖和一般國民，不在敎育與文化方面以堅忍積極的努力與熟忱，普遍澈底的去革除消極被動的舊習慣，創造積極目動的新精神，而來配合充實現有的民主的規範，我很担憂眞正的和平民主日本的實現，仍然會有不少艱難的荆棘，爲了這我曾一再的呼籲，而我現在藉此機會，仍願再度的呼籲日本國民，應該澈底實行思想革命與心理建設，而這個思想革命與心理建設，不僅是一個和平民主日本的保證，也正是日本與其他民主國家重建心理關係的必需保證，其次是日本的復興，在短短的時日中，發現日本國民很努力也很焦急於本國的經濟復與，尤其更關心於鄰國對於日本復興的態度。關於這一點，我可以很坦目的率吿各位，中國國民同時我相信全世界各國，對於日本復興問題亦甚關心，正因爲這不僅是日本一國事，中日兩國的問題，同時也是和整個遠東地區，乃至整個世界的復興與安全有關的問題。回憶戰前，日本的經濟政策，乃軍閥與財閥狼狽爲奸的高度國防經濟，其本質，對內是獨佔的，剝削的，對外是排他的，侵略的。這次不幸戰事的發生，其主要原因卽在於此，而今天日本國民與遠東其他國家尤其中國民衆所受的損失與悲慘的生活，正是這個日本軍閥所造成的。現在中國國民正如日本一樣，正在致力於國民生活的安定與國民經濟的復興，中國在戰時尙且不以日本國民爲戰爭對象，更無理由在戰後置日本國民於餓死狀態而不顧，因此中國國民對於戰後日本國民的同樣的努力，自亦寄予無限的同情。不過中國輿論希望日本復興的計劃與努力，應該鑒於戰前的錯誤與失敗的敎訓。第一，正和日本的政洽必須和平民主化一樣，日本的復興亦必須從日本經濟的和平民主化着手，唯有這樣堅定，才不致有新興財閥之再起，而日本一般國民的生活，藉此得一保陣，對外基於互惠互助之原則，才能不再損人利已，而相輔並行。第二，國際和平與世界安全固不可分，而和平與安全所賴以保障的各國的經濟復興，也同樣是不能分的。事實上日本的復興，如果沒有其他國家特別是近鄰的中國合作與援助，幾乎是不可想像的，因此日本的復興早在他計劃的，當時就應該不但消極的無書於中國，而且積極的必須有助於中國，乃至遠東其他國家的經濟復興質而言之，日本的復興計劃，必須同時從遠東其他國的立塲着眼，任何援助日本復興的計劃，也必須從整個遠東的立塲上使遠東各國的經濟復興及其工業化得以達成平均而平行的發展。有遠東區域經濟復興繁榮才能貢獻於世界整個經濟的復與與繁榮。單單使日本一國成爲遠東工廠的想法不僅是不合理，不可能，同時也是不能接受的。最後關於中日兩國的未來關係，我想特別來說明一下，在我出國以前，和我到達日本以後，我發覺中日兩國的國民，彼此同樣的關心於中日關係的將來。這當然不是僅因爲中國兩國在歷史·地理·文化。經濟各方面都有密切關係，也因爲兩國國民，由於此次戰爭的慘痛敎訓，都希望能够從一個新的基礎出發，來樹立兩　的百年大計。本來在目前對日和會尙未舉行，和約尙未簽訂以前，談不到中日兩國間的直接而正常的國交關係。不過中國的對日根本方針，在戰爭結束當時，就已經可以從蔣主席的「不以怨報怨」的對日聲明看得出來　而運個聲明也就是中國國民傳統精神的道德的表現，就最近中國的民間舉論而言，正如其他聯合國家一樣，中國國民所期待於日本者，無非就是我在上面講的政洽的民主化，與經濟的民主化而已，如果日本能多勵行思想革命與心理建設，切實做到上述兩點，我確信中日兩國的關係，必能走去合理正常的途徑。而並世國家亦必樂於與日本國民携手合作。至於日本朝野希望早訂和約，恢復自主獨立之地位，並得重返國際社會，本人深表興情，並深信中國亦必本其早口召開新會之一貫主張，繼續與有關國衆協議，尋求途徑而促其早日實現也。</p>

<h3>向農村復與委員會建議</h3>
<p>— 儲子潤</p>
<p>中國農約復興委員會，是根據美國援羅法案第四〇七款而繼續，由美國總統委派委員二人，中國達統委派委員三人組織，現已成立。該會委員晏陽初氏曾向中央社記者發表談話，根據共數十年從事平教運動之經驗，設明該會今後工作的途徑與作　，已引起中外人士的注意。</p>
<p>中國之有農村復興運動，在戰前已風起襲湧，如晏陽初之在定縣，高踐四之在無錫，梁漱溟之在鄒平，彭禹廷之在鎭平，沈玄應之在東鄕，陶行知之在曉莊，他們所倡導的鄕村建設運動，平民或民　敎育運動，農村自衛運動，農村合作運動，農　推廣運動，名稱雖殊，其目的都在改造農村，復興農村。</p>
<p>不過由政府機構予以實施者，則始協民二十二年的江西農村服務區。當時以江西農村淸劃收復之初，滿目瘡　，由全國經濟委員會耽國聯專家司丹等三人，赴　設計，在棉麥借款項卜指擬百萬餘元，爲補助江西設立農村合作，敎育。衛生各機爾之用，並另以三十五萬元，就江西四境分股農村服務區十所，爲各種事業策進之據點。惟這一次援華法案，以二千七百五十萬美元作農村復興之用，其財力之雄厚，規模之宏大，那就不可同日而語，真是中國空前之舉。日集中美兩國專家之才智，政府又以全力支持，使致力農村工作者以感到極大的興奮。作者時在該會工作計　尙未確定之節，顧向　建議幾點：</p>
<p>第一，必須採用重點主義利用美援二千七百五十萬美元於復興農村工作，確實是可觀的一大數字，但以全面晨村之廣，受戰禍破壞之深，倘用以普遷實施，還是杯水軍薪，無濟於事。放必須採用重點主義，俾能集中力量，容易見效。譬如一杯糖湯，激冲自有甜味，如多冲了水，那就淡而無味了。我們不應該將這農村復興的財力物力，把它冲淡，樣樣要做，結果樣樣沒有做好，以致不能發生作用·所謂重點主義者，就是選擇者十省內之若千縣實施，由點的實施，發生而的作用，自然可以普及全國·關於地點的選撑，第一希望要相當的安定，不易受到匪亂的威脅。因爲農村建設的工作，需要有相當的轉間和安定的環境，否則建設難而破製易，十年之功可能廢於一且，與其冒險，還不如穩紮穩打。第二希望當地的經濟，有梠當的基礎，使工作計劃不致與當地經濟狀况相差過遠。這機吃得下，就消化得了，容易在當地生根，發榮滋長。第三當地各級的幹部首長，對於此項工作須有相當的認織和贊助的表示，能化阻力爲助力，這不是錦上添花，而是栽者培之。</p>
<p>其次，舉辦的業務，亦應採重點主義，因地制宜，擇農民最感迫切需要而最有發展前金者，集中力量實施之。如過去江蘇的民衆敎育，五花入門，結果徒增農民的麻煩，一事無成。平敎會在定縣，論者亦認爲同犯此病。他們祗是敎育繼續，是試馳性質，所以可以不計成敗，但此次美援復與濃村的結果，只許威功，不能失敗，所以露該慣重將事，集中人力財力，實事求是，免陷過去的覆　，希望做一分就得一分的成績，做一事卽有一事的成就。採用重　主義，是農村復興成功的必備條件。</p>
<p>第二必須就原有之組織機構予以實施爲政在人，幹部決定一切，人的問題，是決定成敗的關　。此次農村復與工作，將利用原有政府機構呢？抑另行委派一批新幹部呢？這是値得注意的問題·照中國的慣例，毎舉辦一件事，往往另設一機構，另用一批人，如辦理公務員日用品配給是如此，五大市平價配米亦是如此，著後救濟是如此，物資供應亦是如此。所以這次利用美援復興農村，亦恐不能例外·照晏先生發表的一套理論來觀察，似乎他也另有一副班底，根據他在定縣的作屬，「、絕不想和政府設施的縣政建設相混」的態度，似乎傾向到另設實施機構的一途了。這是値得深深考慮的。</p>
<p>行新政，固要用新人，但是多用一批人，多一批開支，增加了行政費，就减少了事業費，其結果必然重蹈救濟總署的覆轍。此其一。另設機構，不免與地方原有機構，疊牀榮　，分割地方的事權，徒增加農村的混亂。此其二。中國農村要有辦法，必須政治家，敎育家，經濟家，工業家，和社會改造家等都投身於農村，但知識份子下鄉，畢究與農村有相當的距離。此其三。在無軌道的中國農村裏，不敢說定縣製造的軍子一定到處可行，如若生硬的去幹，未必容易爲農民接受，倘不深入，則不免人存政舉，人亡政息，工作結束以後，農村依舊是原來的農村。此其四。所以我主張利用原有的政治機構及一切地方組織來實施，運用致治力量，因勢利導。這麵辦法，目前當然也有缺點，卽縣以下地方幹部的會汚無能，令人放心不下。但這是可以補救避免的。一則可以該法淘汰，運用地方組織，另選賢能。十室之邑，必有忠信，就地取材，體失而求諸野，這決不是理想。二則可以加强督導，運用各方面之專家下鄉，經常予以技術上的指導，以補救人才的缺陷。</p>
<p>第三，工作的程序必須從增加生產上着手中國農村的四大病，貧·愚·　·私，晏先生主　以文藝，生舊，健康，公民四大敎育來診治，不爲無見，但須知四大病的根本則在貧，因食而不得受敎育故愚，因貧而營養不足故弱，因貧而受到生存的威脅故私。所以農村工作實施之程序，無論如何，應主張富而後敎。孟子說：「惟民救死而恐不號，奚報治禮義哉？」在亂離破產救死不邊的農村裏，敎育恐早已被視爲奢侈品了！生產未發達，根本無敎育可言；復興晨村的原動力，決然是經濟而非敎育。故應多注意於農村經濟生活的改善，先從增加生產入手。例如農田水利，造林，各種合作社之興辦，農具機械的應用，優良品種的推廣，病害蟲的防治，作物園藝牧產的改良，農產品的加工修運等等，凡是最適於現狀而行之最有效果者，必被晨民普遍的歡迎。所以我們應該調査淸礎，因民之利而利之，擬其可勞而之。農民受到了實惠，生活得到改善，感到前途有了新的希望，然後敎之以識字，敎之以文藝，自治，衛生常識，自然也榮於接受。生產愈發達，其所需敎育亦愈迫切，就不難促成政治經濟文化自衛之整個的社會建設，完成農村復興的任務。正如孟子說：「可使制挺以揵棄楚之堅甲利兵矣」。到那時，晏先生所提倡的力的敎育，就可完全實現。不求其本，而齊其末，宜爲智者所不取。</p>

<h3>豫北五百里</h3>
<p>— 本報特派記者　淩松壽</p>
<p>〔本報沙市三日航訊〕從去年秋天匪陳賡部過黃河竄入伏牛山區後，一年來，豫北在四周燃燒着熾烈的烽火中，保持着一個小康局面。</p>
<p>湯陰·安陽·新鄉（六）幾多次大規模的攻防戰，槍炮聲平把豫北人鍜鍊得對織爭的直接威脅，淡然處之；然而今天豫北人在另一方面，却間接地負担着戰爭所賦予他們的更沉重的担十。</p>
<p>匪軍目前在豫北的主力，番號雖多，實力甚弱，核心部隊是徐向前部的十四縱隊，也只有小部份，其餘如新九團，新十團，以及第四十六·四十七·四十九·五十二團等，都不過是地方團隊的改編，總數不足萬人。最近除原據滑縣附近的十四縱隊的四十一·四十二兩個旅逐次移動到封邱附近外，其餘幾股的匪都僅僅在搶刦物資，破壞交通，幹他們那種流竄的生涯，共匪眼光中的豫北，就現在講，決不是一個主要的戰塲，而是一個重要的補給庫，陳賡竄到豫西山地後，在戰略上被他們佔了一個便宜，可是補給問題却是他們的致命傷，靠着山，他們是過不活的，據最近情報，共匪在平漢綫上，從邯鄲向西築了一條支路，經武安而抵涉縣，以其經山西境的潞城·高平·晋城而達豫北沁陽的一條公路相啣接，再向南則由黃河北岸的北白坡（孟縣屬）過河而通到洛陽，邯鄲是共匪冀豫晋邊區的軍事重心，這一條路對豫西共匪械彈的補給是相當重要的，然而軍火以外，他們吃的穿的，却只有靠豫北，——尤其是在匪區所缺乏的物資，如電料棉紗西藥等。這裏，記者願意善意地向豫北關係當局指陳出一兩件事實，這都是記者從老百姓嘴角邊聽到的，當然，我們希望這些都不是事實。</p>
<p>新鄕</p>
<p>這豫北的阪心之地，據說市塲上紊亂得很，初到新鄉，和朋友談起天來，我表示新鄉這種四面環匪的態勢的太不安定。他說：「八路軍才不攻新鄉哩！」「爲啥？」我忙問。他輕描淡寫地吿訴我：「八路攻下了新鄉，他便失去一個互通有無的市塲了。」這種事實，我們可以拿最近新鄉縣政府前任某科張科長的以軍火資匪做例子。</p>
<p>在豫北西部，人們差不多都知道武陟縣也是共匪換取他們所需要的物資的一個塲所。記者從關係方面證實了一個傳說：武陟縣長患病，縣長太太親自出馬，征收由匪區運來的物資的「稅」，因爲豫北大水，記者沒有機會到武陟跑一趟，去訪問除運來的物資而外，是不是還有運去的物資。</p>
<p>焦作</p>
<p>是個孤島，煤向東出不去，便只有向北去，當然，西面離焦作不到十華里就是匪區，就事實上講，共匪拿在這孤島上所最需要的糧食來換取煤斤，在任何情况下總是難於防止的，因爲焦作畢竟有人，人畢竟要吃飯。不過焦作的人未嘗不淸楚，太行山裏，匪有不少的小型兵工廠。</p>
<p>在洛陽沒有陷匪以前，汴洛鄭這一條綫橫亘在黃河之浜，形勢上還像個樣子，何况隴海路有時還可以通到徐州，因此，在那個時候，軍事當局對豫北並沒有寄予重視，汴洛鄭吃緊一次，便有一次放棄豫北的命令，安陽，焦作，是第一步放棄的目標，當今春宛西戰後，陳（毅）劉（伯承）兩股匪的重兵直撲新鄭，鄭州危在旦夕之時，連新鄉都準備作必要的措施，退而固守黃河北岸的橋頭堡，這中間，都虧了豫北駐軍某師李振淸師長。在</p>
<p>豫北</p>
<p>他的這個師是核心部隊，他一再向最高當局痛切陳辭，解釋豫北的重要性，才算保留下了今日的豫北，在豫北這樣大的地區中，他能分配部隊去堅守北面的孤城——安陽，和西面的孤點——焦作，而成爲新鄉向外伸出對着太行山的兩個觸角，進而屏障河南，否則假令豫北籠罩赤氛，則今天的汴鄭孤島，將又是另外一個局面了。不僅此也，汴鄭形勢雖惡，但在目前的中原戰局之中，依然還是一個値得寳貴的堡壘，可是假使當初放棄豫北，那麽今天在河南駐軍的補給就發生困難，一年以來，在隴海綫上，我們我能控制的，只就是幾個都市和縣城，軍需糧秣，大半是豫北負担，這也就是今日豫北人肩頭上第一個沉重的祖子。</p>
<p>豫北的西北面，全是山地，東南兩面的平原上，糧產也很有限，在承平時代就不能自給自足，何况豫北二十五個縣城中，能控制全部縣境的只有原武，陽武兩縣，能入境推行政令的有十八縣（其中有四縣尙不能入城），其餘如濟源，沁陽，孟，溫，涉，武安等縣，全部在匪的盤踞下，就我們所能控制的而言，並不太大。此外，天災幾乎年年侵襲着豫北，共匪又復利用他流竄的行動，到處搶糧，農村中是十室十空，所以目前在豫北民間的本身，糧荒已經是嚴重的問題，更何論再有政府要徵收的公糧和軍糧？然而，豫北終究沒有辜負政府，大河南北駐軍的糧秣，在擠奶的狀態中總算一點一滴地供應下去，雖然民間早已是吃黑麵，苞穀度日脚了。</p>
<p>公糧</p>
<p>行政機關可以不點燈（如修武縣政府），不看報（如新鄉縣政府），可是各級行政機構的經費總是要的，老百姓雖然吃的是黑麵，苞穀，然而黑麵和苞穀也是糧啊！在這種態勢下，豫北在軍民合作下，便對共匪展開了搶糧運動，縣政府爲了要維持老百姓的需要，有力量的都不時領着民衆下鄉去搶共匪的公糧，如修武縣長徐文濤，他便經常在外面游擊，等着匪的空隙，便領導民衆去搬運那原來也是共匪搶去的糧食。</p>
<p>這裏，記者該介紹一下李振淸師長，他，是豫北無數民衆所支持着的一位將領，他的影子刻劃在每一個豫北人的心上，他綽號呌「李鐵頭。</p>
<p>在他的領導下，曾發動兩次</p>
<p>搶糧運動，解除了今春沁泛區間的糧荒，記者從鄭州起，在新鄉，在修武，在焦作，在記者所到過的豫北任何一處地方，老百姓都知道李師長，他們知道：不是李師長，豫北早成了共匪的天下；不是李師長，今年的春荒絕對過不了！李振淸氏的運動戰，針對着共匪的流竄，豫北共匪軍中有個流行的歌謠：「天不愁，地不愁，只怕碰到李鐵頭！」最近李師的某旅，又在豫北西部平原地帶兜了個圈子，一直打到冀南的濮陽，鹵獲很多，可惜記者只在鄭州和李氏見過一面，記者抵豫北時，李氏已因公飛往南京，不然見面談談，當可增加這篇稿子不少的份量。</p>
<p>另外，李氏還有一件事値得一提，他特別注重地方團隊的訓練，裝備，和運用，豫北各界一致承認，豫北團隊自從經李氏整理後，能力增强了不少，李氏在焦作藉着中福煤礦間着的修配廠，利用現成的動力，配合成一個小型兵工廠，現在這個廠每月可出輕機槍三十挺，專爲裝備團隊之用。</p>
<p>豫北人的雙肩担負着沉重的担子，而於沉重的担子之外，還有許多外在的阻力。使得這付担子更沉重，記者和駐在新鄉的豫省第四區行政專員錢敬忠氏閒談。他說：抗戰以來，他一直做豫北人民的創子手，可是在今天，敎民衆出血已經不是痛不痛的問題，而是他們的血有沒有的問題了</p>
<h3>黃渡沈婦暴斃案　當局限澈查嚴辦</h3>
<p>〔本報靑浦十日訊〕黃渡塘灣沈龐桂英被區署非法拘押暴斃案，經蘇高院法醫宣芳於八月廿八日開棺復驗結果，鑑定書已於八日到縣，斷定爲「被姦致死」，羣情憤慨。據縣司法處主任審判官王積元審判官王正宇表示：「此案强姦部份旣經檢定，已有端倪，主犯何人，現正進行偵查中。案情各節，自當本司法精神，秉公處斷」。該案罪嫌重大之民衛第一中隊第三分隊長羅占雲（駐防靑龍區署），前於八月中旬省政府督導團蒞靑，獲悉本案及另一范姓鄉婦被姦案，（羅亦有重大嫌疑）後，以部隊軍紀不良，地方輿論沸騰，曾電省保安司令部將中隊長曾國衡撤職。羅當時被諭令縣府拘押，並限期澈査嚴辦，以肅風紀，並平民憤。現經轉移司法處羈押偵査，區署關係人員，亦由司法處偵査中。此一公案，不久當能大白。</p>
<p>〔又訊〕日前盛傳靑浦黃渡沈婦案，承審官廖斌撤職査辦一節，按縣司法處審判官係於八月十八日由蘇高院命令更迭，新任主任審判官由王積元接充，廖並非撤職査辦。因此案司法處內檢驗吏及書記官均突離職潛逃，廖係原辦該案審判官，電高院派法醫檢驗，亦由其主張，其調缺原因爲資歷不合。</p>

<p>交大呼籲　專家為糾正</p>
<p>〔又訊〕本市國立交通大學敎授會，認爲此次政府改革幣制，對公敎人員待遇之規定仍未能絲毫予以改善，實覺過份忽視人民之生活。特代電南京國大代表聯誼會·立法院·行政院·監察院及敎育部，作緊急呼細。請求及時考慮，迅爲糾正，以改善一般公敎人員生活。並分函全國各國立專科以上學校敎授會聯絡，希予支持。代電電文略稱：</p>
<p>改革幣制一致擁護</p>
<p>「此次政府改革幣制，挽救通貨膨脹，安定社會經濟，實係緊急必要之揹施，無可訾議。自應一致擁護，以度難關。惟査社會經濟之基礎端在一般生活之改發，戰亂十年，大部份人民均織於水深火熱之中，尤以公敎人負爲甚。</p>
<p>知識份子中流砥柱</p>
<p>公敎人員爲國家政務基層之幹部，且皆爲知識份子，對於國家政治實不異中流之砥柱。故政務之能否澄淸，思想之能否矯正，依賴至設。年來貪汚橫行，動亂不止，其因果實基於此。公敎人員之待遇在抗戰以前尙足　康，抗戰初期八折支付，勉能維持。嗣後通貨膨脹，待遇日低，初則忍痛尙無怨言，繼則無法生活，乃成今日之現象。此次改革幣劍，對於公敎待遇忽視過甚，宣屬遺憾。新幣與銀元原已對折，今復有十分之二及十分之一之折扣。</p>
<p>待遇之低　實堪哀憫</p>
<p>故其待遇之低實堪哀憫。婉無糾正辦法，則政務之不能提高效率，社會之不能澈底安定，政府實不能辭其責。同人等目睹時艱，不忍緘默，極望今後一切措施，必須及於基層。對於改善民生，更應有確切之認識。此次公敎待遇規定之不合理，允宜及時重新考慮，迅爲改正，以資挽救。</p>

<p>自由談</p>
<h3>公敎人員</h3>
<p>— 靖文</p>
<p>公敎人員這個稱呼，恐怕是抗戰後的產物，因爲過去似乎不大聴見有人將這兩種職業生活者聯繫起來稱呼的。當時的公務員，一般人都稱之謂「喫機關飯」的，一身中山裝與一隻黑色的公文皮包，是當時中上級公務人員的一種特殊標幟。特別在尙不見過大世面的內地小城市，「喫機開飯」的名稱似乎含有特殊的身份意義，呌起來響亮得很。</p>
<p>全於敎員，雖然不如公務員身份那樣帶幾分「戚風」，然其地位的淸高，則尤勝於「喫機關飯」的了。這兩種職業者的生活，雖在當時也談不到如何的優裕，但終不失是普通人所企望的職業，因爲雖然說不上優裕，至少尙能個人有安定的生活，如果你別無野心，對「公僕」與冷板　的生涯確有志願和興趣，則更有成爲你終身職業的可能。</p>
<p>我想，如果用職業的區分去測驗一個國家的興衰，則公敎人員職業的進退，應該是一個很適宜的判斷尺度。何以見得？因爲公敎這兩種職業，足以代表一國中堅智識份子的安定力量。產業勞動固然是一國經濟强弱的最後決定要素，但欲使產業勞動的成果昇華爲一國社會的文化與文明，就不得不在注重生產勞動之外，更進而扶植勞心工作者。古代的奴隸社會，雖然亦能產生貴族的文化，但這終究是畸形的。在勞力與勞心不獲平衡發展的社會，其所表現的文明無論顯得如何燦爛，却終是不能持久。</p>
<p>自從產業革命的影響遍及全世界後，各國的社會構造，即起了極大的變化，而其最顯著的特點，便是有所謂智識階級的存在。在此以前，智識份子祗限於少數官吏，僧侶，學渚及哲人，他們在古代的社會中雖亦有各自的特殊的地位，但並沒有集團性的社會地位。智識份子而取得智識階級的社會地位，在將來世界文化史者的筆下，必然能佔到重要的一頁。</p>
<p>所謂智識階級，雖不能嚴格稱之謂一種階級，但正唯因爲它沒有固定的，狹義的階級性，倒反成了現代社會的眞正安定力量。就職業的類別言，所誚白領階級更足爲任何社會中智識階級的代表層。而公敎人員便是這代表層中最有力量的一環。同爲構成智識階級者雖不限於公敎人員，但在任何一個現代的進步國家中，公敎人員的職業地位，數量上必然居於其他智識職業的首位。在公敎人負以外的其他所謂自由職業者，其社會地位雖然亦極重要，不過，一個特出的文學家或詩人，不一定就表現了一國普遍的文化發展。例如在農奴時代的俄國，偉大的文人輩出，但當時俄國社會的普遍文化水準，却遠落於西歐各國之後。反之，在一個智識階級能獲得普遍發展的社會中，縱使尙無偉大的思想家或詩人出現，惟該社會的文化水準，必然能獲比較平衡的發展，同時其一般人民的生活，也一定比較安定富裕。今日的美國便是這樣，今日的條聯亦在接近此稱狀態中。</p>
<p>可是我國戰後的公敎人員生活，却備受摧殘打擊，不僅長期在飢餓綫上掙扎，且大有不能再生存之勢。國家經濟力景薄弱，也許是事實，然環顧週國情形，則又用得到不患寡而患不均的話了。</p>
<p>筆者雖然與這兩種職業都曾有過關係，然執簽此短文的動機，則絕非出於自私之念。窮公務員與窮敎員這幾年來已窮出了名，其生活狀况有時反不及胼手胝足之輩。勞力者的生活自然應不斷的加以改善，但勞心者的生活也不能置之不顧。一國的興盛發展，必賴其社會成員間生活的平衡。在以階級社會爲號召的國家中尙且不遺餘力的在改善智識份子的生活，提高白領階級的社會地位，以謀勞力勞心打成一片，何以我們反在作踐中堅社會曆的智識份子？</p>
<p>也許有人說，公敎人員至今沒有聴見餓死的，也沒有人赤膊上辦公室。但這好比是一個肺病患者，他內部的潰爛程度，不一定馬上顯於外表。而事實上穿了太太袴子上敎室的敎員，以及因貧自殺的公務員，早都已發見過了，</p>

<h3>吃不飽的人們</h3>
<p>— 索貝</p>
<p>國人對於吃之一道是非常「極端」的，舉世各國的食譜中，要以咱們爲最驚人：從草皮樹根到雞鴨魚翅，無所不有。</p>
<p>今日三分之一的人在吃樹根草皮甚至人肉，而另有多少分之一的人却山珍海味，無所不用其極。無論喜事喪事，必須大開盛筵，不但要飽要醉，而且要肚子發漲，爲了吃化上整個半日的時間在所不惜，而且理該如是。</p>
<p>西方人見面時問聲「你好嗎？」咱們見面時：「飯用過了沒有？」抗戰時在華工作的友邦人士，也染上了動輒請客吃飯的習慣，據他們說，「在中國，什麼事情，只要吃吃飯喝喝酒，便少有辦不通的。</p>
<p>故不論在勝利以前或以後，中國的幾個大都市（上海尤然），人們只要有錢，吃什麼有什麼，比「金元國」並不遜色，世運選手到國外去得自備糧食，頗感不慣，一回上海就立刻解放了。</p>
<p>英國以小康局面之國家，尙且「有鷄蛋大家吃」，而且省省地吃，剩下來運國外去賣，換取外匯；蘇聯以二大强國之一，亦節衣縮食，省下錢來建設工業，但我們却是十七世紀的生產，二十世紀的浪費，瘋狂地吃，拚命地吃，全不講食物的實際效用，人生意義全部寄託於舌頭上。結果：據醫學家說，中國人的腸胃比西方人爲大而畏，但平均壽命僅三十二歲。</p>
<p>中國人愛吃，濫吃，實亦目古已然，向來上刑塲的人犯，必要求臨死飽吃一頓，免作餓鬼。可謂死也要吃！再說：開門七件事，無一件不是爲了吃。我不懂咱們究竟是因爲目來就沒有吃飽而致如此呢？還是永遠吃不飽的呢？</p>
<p>又是節屆中秋了，上海的豪富，照例必從難民與乞丐的行列中擠過，再衝進大餐館，豪飲狂吃一頓，以度佳節。至於家中的火腿蛋黃月餅之類，當然更如山積。</p>
<p>因此，當局又有節約花生黃豆換取外匯的擬議了，豪富之流難免將大搖其頭，因爲他們是寗可把外匯吃下，以肥一己的。</p>
<p>在太平盛世，他們的吃法及作風，已非「民族健康」之道，何况今天？</p>
<h3>戒烟</h3>
<p>— 談客</p>
<p>爲了想表現一下自己的決心和毅力，並和妻「爭一口氣」的緣故，我決定戒烟了。把衣袋裏僅餘的五六枝香烟一口氣狂吸完畢，用肥皂和刷子將被烟燻黃了的手指猛擦了一陣，雖然沒有完全除去指上的烟黃，總算已下了洗手不吸的決心了。大約動作太過火了一點，妻在旁邊笑了。問她爲什麼笑，她不饗。她不說我便不知道嗎？明明是輕視，而且有懷疑的意思，其意若日：「戒烟嗎？看你戒得成！」</p>
<p>好！無論如何不吸烟。晚上入浴，也「擊水而誓」起來。——半天過去了，一晚當然無話。</p>
<p>第二天晨起，伸手入衣袋掏香烟，立刻腦幕上現出二個字來：戒烟！這是自我的警吿，彷彿是有聲的。但這對我不很自然，好像見到電影院裏「請勿吸烟」的燈光標語一樣。朋友們來聊天，見我不敬烟，就上門請客起來，雖然聲明已經實行戒烟了，他們還是殷勤勸烟。眼看著他們噴雲吐務，心中自然不免有些動搖，可我不吸就是不吸，也就罷了</p>
<p>朋友去了，獨個兒看看書，寫寫什麼，好幾次伸手入袋，也好幾次用剛從袋裏伸出來的手去翻抽斗，當然沒有烟。此時煩惱已極。在平日，便立刻去買烟，但戒烟了呀，決。，毅力，門氣……。</p>
<p>拚命的想把自己鎭定下來。竭力把我的注意力拉到書本上去，但這正如强迫自己入睡一樣，毫無效果。相反地，「烟，烟，烟，」儘在我腦際跳躍。</p>
<p>妻在我背後拍了我一下：</p>
<p>「抽烟吧！」</p>
<p>她授給我一包烟。我向那包烟望了望，硬說出「不抽」二個字來。妻已覺察了我的心事，湊近我的耳邊說：</p>
<p>「鬥什麼氣！抽烟吧！停會兒你自己去買，反不好意思呢！</p>
<p>我的戒烟，於</p>

<p>一前輩語我，辛亥「京陷帝奔」之電訊，乃上海天鐸報所偽造。該報某日發出號外，大字刋出此四字，稱北京電，人心爲之狂動。此偽造消息隨即散播各地，香港廣州尤震動，遂促成廣東之反正。天繹報主特人爲南海李文卿民國成立，以是叙功，十餘年後曾一度任茂名懸長云云。余以爲有功革命之舉，必有喜言掌故者爲之表彰，恨讀書少，僅能略述所聞如上耳。辛亥之役，人知淸之必亡，然當民軍失利之際，京何由而陷，民衆又不思不問也。數年前，知有所謂「謀略新聞」者，名尙不惡，而實多半偽造，是即造謠。造謠乃手段，亦視其目的如何耳。然當國際戰爭，各方僞消息太多且亂，人亦漸不置信。若謂辦報必有特別作用，各報自有其立塲，此等報縱不造謠，其處理新聞，幾於無一字無謀略在也。報紙紀事，世稱時史，我國先哲，極重史筆，風氣旣變，記者倘以史家自居乎，劉子玄章實齋所標之史才，史學，史識，史德四者，必不視爲陳言。「報道」二字，來自日本，我國人競用之，予不曉其義，懂知爲一動詞，非柔道，茶道之道也。</p>

<h3>The Range of Price Fluctuations Has Narrowed. Four Banks Discuss Loan Recipients. Statistics of Gold, Silver, and Foreign Currency Redemption in Various Regions Up to the 6th: Valued at US$5,680,000</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 11th] During the Four Banks Joint Council meeting on the 11th, the loan policy and scope were discussed. Premier Weng and Finance Minister Qian spoke, both advocating that loans should be tightly controlled. Because the amount of currency to be issued in the future has been determined, each bank and bureau must strictly review loan applications to prevent speculative funds from flooding the market. The council approved two public transportation project loans on the 11th, granting 40,000 Gold Yuan each to the Capital Automobile Company and the Jiangnan Automobile Company.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 11th] The Four Banks Headquarters held its 371st council meeting on the morning of the 11th. Chairman Weng Wenhao and all council members were present. First, the Secretariat reported on the changes in finance and prices in various regions after the currency reform. Generally speaking, interest rates have decreased, exchange rates are gradually stabilizing, and although various prices still fluctuate slightly, the range has narrowed. Furthermore, as of the 6th of this month, according to the reports received, the total amount of gold redeemed in various regions was over 623,000 taels, silver over 1,367,000 taels, silver dollars over 6,231,000, US dollars 12,870,000, and Hong Kong dollars 33,040,000. The net income from import and export foreign exchange during the same period was US$12,000,000, bringing the total income to US$56,680,000. Subsequently, the council discussed the following proposals:</p>
<p>1. Regarding the revision of loan recipients and methods, it was generally agreed that the selection of recipients should be tightened within the four major categories previously stipulated: (1) daily necessities production enterprises, (2) basic industrial and mining enterprises, (3) public transportation enterprises, and (4) export trade enterprises. Loans should be limited to working capital only. This proposal will be further studied for detailed and clear regulations.</p>
<p>2. The interest calculation methods for loans from various banks and treasuries were approved by the 370th council meeting, with a maximum monthly interest rate of 3% from August 23rd. Recently, the Executive Yuan issued regulations on limiting interest rates for bank and pawnshop deposits and loans, stipulating that both new and old deposits and loans should be calculated at a monthly interest rate of 3% from August 23rd, except for the following two items: (1) Industrial and commercial loans that matured before August 22nd but have not yet been repaid are allowed to charge overdue interest according to banking practices. (2) Agricultural loans that have already been issued will continue to be charged at the original interest rate. However, from August 23rd, the portion exceeding a monthly interest rate of 3% should be deposited in separate accounts by the Farmers Bank of China and the Cooperative Bank of China for improving farmers' welfare.</p>
<h3>US$70 Million in Construction Aid Funds to Be Allocated to Our Country Soon. Export-Import Bank Denies That Yan Xishan Contacted Them for Loans</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 10th] Paul G. Hoffman, Administrator of the Economic Cooperation Administration (ECA), said that the ECA may allocate funds for the main parts of the overall Chinese construction plan approved by the China Mission in late September. Hoffman declined to comment on other opinions and recommendations from the ECA's China Construction Survey Team. According to Hoffman, Leighton Stuart will go to China within the week, and within 30 days of his arrival in China, the main funds for the US$70 million US aid industrial construction and supplementary plan for China can be allocated. Hoffman praised the work of the Construction Survey Team in China, saying that the team has thoroughly studied a large number of plans that can receive economic assistance from the Economic Cooperation Administration. Regarding China's new currency, Hoffman said that he has not yet received a report from Leighton Stuart, the representative in China, and because China's current situation is difficult, he is unwilling to make any approvals on this matter. Hoffman continued to say that the Economic Cooperation Administration is very willing to see China's economic reform succeed. If this reform is successful, it will greatly stabilize the currency system and accelerate China's recovery. It is reported that Yan Jiagan, a member of the China US Aid Utilization Committee, visited Leighton Stuart again today for talks.</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 10th] Senior officials of the Export-Import Bank on the 10th denied reports that Yan Xishan, Chairman of Shanxi Province, China, had sent representatives to contact the bank for any loans. According to recent reports, Yan Xishan had requested the Export-Import Bank for loans of US$5 million to US$10 million to strengthen Shanxi's anti-communist position. The Chinese Embassy here has also officially stated that this news is "doubtful."</p>

The statement was broadcast to the Japanese people at 5:15 PM. The original text of the statement is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>This time, I came to inspect post-war Japan in a personal capacity. I am deeply grateful for the sincere assistance from MacArthur and the responsible persons at all levels of the Allied General Headquarters, the frank reports from the leaders of the Japanese government and people, and the direct observations and experiences I gained from my personal visits to various parts of Japan, which gave me a more intimate understanding of the occupation policies of the Allied General Headquarters and their implementation achievements, as well as the various situations in post-war Japan. Now that the inspection has come to an end and I am scheduled to return to my country on the 12th, I would like to briefly express my thoughts and feelings as parting words.</p>
<p>Three years have passed since the end of the war. In these short years, the reborn Japan has already possessed the model of peace and democracy in various systems and regulations, and the general Japanese people can also follow the instructions of the Allied General Headquarters and move forward step by step. It can be said that all of this illustrates the great achievements of MacArthur and his colleagues, as well as the excellent character of the Japanese people in serving the public and abiding by the law, which is worthy of our unanimous praise. However, the true essence of democracy not only lies in the reform and establishment of systems and regulations, but also requires a thorough understanding and firm belief in democratic ideology by the general public and leaders. The difficult and distant road to democratization in Japan is like "Rome was not built in a day." It requires the foresighted and the general public of Japan to have a genuine enthusiasm for autonomy and initiative, and an indomitable spirit of perseverance to work together and move forward hand in hand to achieve success. Originally, the Japanese people, having lived under the oppression of Shinto, feudalism, and militarism for a long time, had long lacked the democratic training to take the initiative. Their original good character had been almost completely destroyed. Awakening from the nightmare of war failure, they have embarked on the great road of democratic rebirth under the leadership of the Allies. However, because the time has been too short, they have not been able to grasp the goal and leap forward bravely. This is also an undeniable fact. Since my arrival in Japan, I have contacted officials of the Allied General Headquarters at all levels and in various regions, as well as representatives of other allied countries. I have also listened to the opinions of a majority of leaders from all walks of life in Japan. I have also personally observed the family lives and social lives of the people in various parts of Japan. I always feel that it is easy to transform tangible systems and regulations, but difficult to transform intangible psychology and ideology. If leaders from all walks of life in Japan and the general public do not make persistent and proactive efforts and enthusiasm in education and culture to thoroughly eliminate the old habits of passivity and create a new spirit of activity and initiative to complement and enrich the existing democratic norms, I am very worried that the realization of a truly peaceful and democratic Japan will still have many difficult thorns. For this reason, I have repeatedly appealed, and I would like to take this opportunity to reiterate that the Japanese people should thoroughly implement ideological revolution and psychological construction. This ideological revolution and psychological construction is not only a guarantee of a peaceful and democratic Japan, but also a necessary guarantee for Japan to rebuild psychological relationships with other democratic countries. Secondly, regarding Japan's reconstruction, in a short period of time, it has been discovered that the Japanese people are working very hard and are also very anxious about their country's economic recovery. They are especially concerned about the attitude of neighboring countries towards Japan's reconstruction. Regarding this point, I can frankly tell you that the Chinese people, and I believe all countries in the world, are very concerned about the issue of Japan's reconstruction. This is not only because Japan is a country, and not only a matter between China and Japan, but also a matter related to the reconstruction and security of the entire Far East region and even the entire world. Recalling the pre-war period, Japan's economic policy was a highly national defense economy in which warlords and financial cliques colluded with each other. Its essence was monopolistic and exploitative internally, and exclusive and aggressive externally. The main reason for the unfortunate war was this, and the losses and miserable lives suffered by the Japanese people and other countries in the Far East, especially the Chinese people, were caused by this Japanese warlord. Now, the Chinese people, like the Japanese, are working hard to stabilize the lives of the people and revive the national economy. China did not treat the Japanese people as the target of the war during the war, and there is no reason to disregard the Japanese people and let them starve to death after the war. Therefore, the Chinese people also have unlimited sympathy for the same efforts of the Japanese people after the war. However, Chinese public opinion hopes that Japan's reconstruction plan and efforts should learn from the mistakes and failures of the pre-war period. First, just as Japan's politics must be peaceful and democratic, Japan's reconstruction must also start with the peaceful democratization of the Japanese economy. Only by being so firm can we prevent the resurgence of new financial cliques, and the lives of the general Japanese people can be protected by this. Externally, based on the principle of mutual benefit and mutual assistance, we can no longer harm others and benefit ourselves, but instead work in parallel to complement each other. Second, international peace and world security are inseparable, and the economic recovery of each country that peace and security rely on is also inseparable. In fact, Japan's recovery is almost unimaginable without the cooperation and assistance of other countries, especially neighboring China. Therefore, when Japan's recovery was planned, it should not only passively not harm China, but also actively help China, and even the economic recovery of other countries in the Far East. In essence, Japan's recovery plan must simultaneously consider the position of other countries in the Far East. Any plan to assist Japan's recovery must also consider the entire Far East in order to achieve an average and parallel development of the economic recovery and industrialization of various countries in the Far East. Only a prosperous and prosperous Far East regional economy can contribute to the recovery and prosperity of the world's entire economy. The idea of ​​simply making Japan a factory in the Far East is not only unreasonable and impossible, but also unacceptable. Finally, regarding the future relations between China and Japan, I would like to explain it in particular. Before I went abroad and after I arrived in Japan, I found that the people of China and Japan were equally concerned about the future of Sino-Japanese relations. This is of course not only because the two countries have close historical, geographical, cultural, and economic ties, but also because the people of both countries hope to start from a new foundation and establish a long-term plan for the two countries, due to the tragic lessons of this war. Originally, direct and normal state-to-state relations between China and Japan could not be discussed before the peace conference with Japan was held and the peace treaty was signed. However, China's fundamental policy towards Japan was already evident in President Chiang's statement of "not retaliating with resentment" towards Japan at the time of the war's end, and that statement was also a moral expression of the traditional spirit of the Chinese people. As far as recent Chinese public opinion is concerned, just like other United Nations countries, what the Chinese people expect from Japan is nothing more than the democratization of politics and the democratization of the economy that I mentioned above. If Japan can encourage ideological revolution and psychological construction and earnestly achieve the above two points, I am sure that the relationship between China and Japan will be able to embark on a rational and normal path. Countries in the world will also be happy to cooperate with the Japanese people. As for the hope of the Japanese government and people to conclude a peace treaty as soon as possible, restore their independent and autonomous status, and return to the international community, I express my deep feelings and believe that China will also continue to discuss with the relevant countries and seek ways to promote its early realization, based on its consistent advocacy of convening a new conference as soon as possible.</p>

<h3>Suggestions for the Rural Reconstruction Commission</h3>
<p>— Chu Zirun</p>
<p>The Chinese Rural Reconstruction Commission was established based on Section 407 of the American Aid Act, with two commissioners appointed by the President of the United States and three commissioners appointed by the President of China. The commission has now been established. Commissioner Y.C. James Yen recently gave an interview to the Central News Agency, outlining the commission's future direction and approach based on his decades of experience in mass education. This has attracted attention from both Chinese and foreign individuals.</p>
<p>The rural reconstruction movement in China had already been gaining momentum before the war, as seen in the work of Y.C. James Yen in Ding County, Gao Jiansi in Wuxi, Liang Shuming in Zouping, Peng Yuting in Zhenping, Shen Xuanying in Dongxiang, and Tao Xingzhi in Xiaozhuang. Although their advocated rural construction movement, mass or people's education movement, rural self-defense movement, rural cooperative movement, agricultural extension movement went by different names, their goal was to transform and revitalize rural areas.</p>
<p>However, the first government-implemented initiative was the Jiangxi Rural Service District, established in 1933. At that time, Jiangxi was in ruins after the communist suppression and recovery. The National Economic Council invited three experts from the League of Nations, including Mr. Stam, to design a plan. Over one million yuan was allocated from the cotton and wheat loan to subsidize the establishment of rural cooperation, education, and health organizations in Jiangxi. In addition, 350,000 yuan was used to establish ten rural service districts in the four regions of Jiangxi, serving as bases for promoting various undertakings. However, this new aid bill, with 27.5 million US dollars allocated for rural reconstruction, is unparalleled in its financial strength and scale. This truly is an unprecedented undertaking in China. With the combined talents of Chinese and American experts and the full support of the government, those dedicated to rural work are greatly excited. As the author was working at the commission at the time, although the specific details have not yet been determined, I would like to offer a few suggestions:</p>
<p>First, a focus-oriented approach must be adopted. The 27.5 million US dollars of American aid is indeed a considerable sum for rural reconstruction, but given the vastness of rural areas and the depth of war damage, it would be a drop in the bucket if distributed evenly. A focus-oriented approach must be adopted to concentrate resources for easier and more effective results. For example, a cup of sugar water tastes sweet when concentrated, but becomes diluted and tasteless when too much water is added. We should not dilute this rural reconstruction funding and resources, trying to do everything and achieving nothing, resulting in no impact. The focus-oriented approach means selecting several counties within ten provinces for implementation. The effects of this focused implementation will naturally spread throughout the country. Regarding site selection, the primary consideration should be stability, with minimal threat from bandit disturbances. Rural construction work requires time and a stable environment. Otherwise, construction is difficult while destruction is easy, and ten years of effort can be undone in a day. It is better to be cautious and build a solid foundation than to take risks. The second consideration is that the local economy should have a sufficient base, so that the work plan does not deviate too far from the local economic conditions. What can be eaten can be digested, making it easier to take root, thrive, and grow locally. Thirdly, local cadres and leaders at all levels should have a good understanding of and express support for this work, turning resistance into assistance. This is not merely gilding the lily, but rather nurturing what is planted.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the business activities should also adopt a focus-oriented approach, adapting to local conditions and selecting the most urgent needs of farmers and those with the greatest development potential, concentrating resources on their implementation. For example, the mass education in Jiangsu in the past was a jumble, resulting only in increased trouble for farmers and nothing achieved. Critics also considered the mass education association in Ding County to have made this mistake. They were only continuing education and were experimental in nature, so they could disregard success or failure, but this time the American aid for rural reconstruction must succeed and cannot fail. Therefore, we must be careful and focus human and financial resources, be realistic and pragmatic, avoid repeating the past mistakes, and hope to achieve results for every effort made and success for every undertaking. Adopting a focus-oriented approach is a prerequisite for successful rural reconstruction.</p>
<p>Second, existing organizations and institutions must be utilized for implementation. Governance depends on people, and cadres determine everything. The issue of personnel is the key to determining success or failure. Will this rural reconstruction work utilize existing government agencies or will it appoint a new batch of cadres? This is a question worth noting. According to Chinese custom, whenever something is undertaken, a new organization is often established and a new group of people is used, as seen in the distribution of daily necessities to civil servants, the flat-price rice distribution in the five major cities, post-war relief, and material supply. Therefore, there is concern that the same will happen with this American aid for rural reconstruction. Based on Mr. Yan's published theories, it seems that he also has his own team. Judging by his attitude in Ding County, where he "absolutely did not want to mix with government-implemented county construction," he seems to be leaning towards establishing a separate implementing agency. This is worth serious consideration.</p>
<p>Implementing new policies certainly requires new people, but using more people means more expenses, which increases administrative costs and reduces project funding, inevitably repeating the mistakes of the Relief Administration. This is the first concern. Establishing a separate agency inevitably overlaps with existing local agencies, further complicating matters and dividing local authority, only adding to the confusion in rural areas. This is the second concern. For there to be solutions to China's rural problems, politicians, educators, economists, industrialists, and social reformers must all devote themselves to rural areas, but intellectuals going to the countryside ultimately have a certain distance from rural areas. This is the third concern. In the untamed Chinese countryside, it cannot be said that the Ding County model is universally applicable. If it is rigidly implemented, it may not be easily accepted by farmers. If it is not thorough, then it will inevitably be a case of the policy existing as long as the person is there, and the policy dying when the person is gone. After the work is completed, the countryside will still be the same as before. This is the fourth concern. Therefore, I advocate utilizing existing political agencies and all local organizations for implementation, using governing power to guide the situation. Of course, this approach also has its drawbacks, namely the incompetence and corruption of local cadres below the county level, which is worrying. But this can be remedied and avoided. One approach is to eliminate incompetence through legal means and utilize local organizations to select the virtuous and capable. Even in a small village of ten households, there must be someone who is loyal and trustworthy. Drawing talent from the local area, seeking it in the countryside after losing it in the court, is by no means an ideal. Another approach is to strengthen supervision, utilizing experts from all fields to go to the countryside and provide regular technical guidance to compensate for talent deficiencies.</p>
<p>Third, the work process must start with increasing production. The four major problems in rural China are poverty, ignorance, weakness, and selfishness. Mr. Yan advocates using the four types of education—literacy, livelihood, health, and citizenship—to address these issues, which is not without merit, but it must be understood that the root of the four major problems lies in poverty. Because they cannot afford to eat, they cannot receive education, hence ignorance. Because of poverty, they lack nutrition, hence weakness. Because of poverty, their survival is threatened, hence selfishness. Therefore, the implementation process of rural work, no matter what, should advocate becoming wealthy before being educated. Mencius said, "Only when the people are saved from death and fear not dying can they then be taught about ritual and righteousness." In a disrupted and impoverished rural area where saving lives is not possible, education is probably already seen as a luxury! Without developed production, there is no education to speak of; the driving force for rural reconstruction is definitely economics, not education. Therefore, more attention should be paid to improving rural economic life, starting with increasing production. For example, farmland irrigation, afforestation, the establishment of various cooperatives, the application of agricultural machinery, the promotion of superior varieties, the prevention and control of pests and diseases, the improvement of crop, horticulture, and animal husbandry production, and the processing and transportation of agricultural products, etc. Anything that is most suitable for the current situation and most effective will be widely welcomed by the farmers. Therefore, we should conduct a thorough investigation, benefiting the people by benefiting them, and proposing what they can work on and guiding them in doing so. When farmers receive practical benefits, their lives improve, and they feel that there is new hope for the future, they will naturally be more willing to accept being taught literacy, literature, self-governance, and hygiene knowledge. The more developed the production, the more urgent the need for education, which will make it easier to promote the entire social construction of politics, economics, culture, and self-defense, completing the task of rural reconstruction. Just as Mencius said, "It can be made to make a stick to strike the strong armor and sharp weapons of Chu." At that time, the education of force advocated by Mr. Yan can be fully realized. Neglecting the root and focusing on the branches is not what wise people would do.</p>

<h3>South Korean Special Envoy Arrives in Shanghai; Paid Respects to President Jiang Last Night in Nanjing</h3>
<p>[Report by this Newspaper] South Korean Special Envoy Dr. Cho Byeong-ok arrived at Longhua Airport in this city at 1:45 PM yesterday on a Pan American flight from Tokyo. Deputy Envoy Chung Il-hyung, Economic Advisor Kim Woo-pyung, and Secretary Kim Joon-koo arrived with him. That evening at 7:30 PM, Cho and others attended a welcoming banquet hosted by Chen Guolian, director of our Ministry of Foreign Affairs Shanghai Office. Pan Gongzhan, He Yaozu, Xuan Tiewu, Fang Zhi, and Xu Shaochang, our former Consul General in Yangon who has been transferred to Seoul, were also present. After the banquet, Cho and others took an overnight train to Nanjing to pay respects to President Chiang and senior government officials. They are scheduled to return to Shanghai on the 14th, at which time they will be hosted by Mayor Wu Guozhen and introduced to various construction projects in the city. On the 15th, various sectors of Shanghai will hold a meeting to welcome the South Korean guests. Cho and others are scheduled to take a Northwest Airlines flight to Manila on the 16th and then travel to Washington on the 18th for a brief stay in the United States before attending the United Nations General Assembly in Paris.</p>
<p>After arriving in Shanghai, Cho met with visiting reporters at the International Hotel and made the following remarks:</p>
<h3>Remarks by Special Envoy Cho</h3>
<p>The main purpose of this visit to China is to pay respects to President Chiang on behalf of President Syngman Rhee and to express sincere gratitude to President Chiang for his assistance in helping Korea achieve independence. When asked about the current situation in Korea, he optimistically replied: Korea is currently very peaceful, and the people are full of confidence. They believe that since the government has declared its establishment, the entire country should work together to achieve the independence and unity of all of Korea with the assistance of China, the United States, the Philippines, and other friendly nations. When asked about the situation in North Korea, he stated firmly: The nine million people of North Korea have already become "prisoners of a communist regime supported by foreign forces." For this reason, the twenty million people of South Korea should work even harder to unite and save their compatriots in North Korea from their plight.</p>
<p>This is Cho's second visit to China, but as he arrived in Shanghai in a hurry, he did not dare to speak of his impressions immediately. However, he expressed: The Korean people have always been concerned about the evolution of the situation in China after the victory of the war against Japan, and the Korean people also believe that China should resolve all of its own problems in the shortest possible time. This will not only maintain peace in the Far East, but also greatly assist in resolving the Korean issue. After all, the relationship between China and Korea has a history of thousands of years, so the problems of China and Korea are truly interdependent. In conclusion, he said: We hope that China will be able to eliminate all reactionary elements, especially the red elements, in the shortest possible time. The red elements are the common enemy of the people of China and Korea, and he is confident that China's work to eliminate the red terror will be successful.</p>

Hsu's trip to Sichuan will be to do his best for his hometown based on the actual situation. (2) After the currency reform, a rush to purchase green currency occurred in Kunming, causing prices to skyrocket. The Assembly accused Li Deyin, the manager of the Kunming Central Bank, of using his power for corruption and demanded that the central government investigate thoroughly to appease public anger. Hsu's trip is also tasked with this mission.</p>

<h3>The Three Western Powers Have the Greatest Determination to Prevent the Westward Expansion of Soviet Influence, Moscow Negotiations Will Reopen Soon, If the Berlin Issue Is Not Resolved, It Can Only Be Referred to the United Nations</h3>
<p>[Our newspaper's report] Moscow broadcast on the 11th: British, American, and French ambassadors to the Soviet Union are currently exchanging important letters and telegrams with their home governments to discuss what new steps to take to deal with the four-power talks on the Berlin issue. U.S. Ambassador Smith still got up at 3:00 a.m. to draft a telegram to Washington, but it is feared that the four-power talks will be difficult to hold this weekend.</p>
<p>[Our newspaper's report] London broadcast on the 11th: When Britain, the United States, and France discuss the Berlin issue with the Soviet Union again, they will propose a deadline, demanding that the Soviet Union reply with a specific date for lifting the Berlin blockade within the specified deadline, otherwise the issue can only be transferred to the United Nations for handling.</p>
<p>[Our newspaper's report] New York broadcast on the 11th: According to sources close to the diplomatic community, Britain, the United States, and France do not intend to continue discussing the Berlin issue with the Soviet Union. The three countries have decided to jointly publish a white paper, declaring that the Berlin incident is the fault of the Soviet Union, and stating that they will submit the issue to the United Nations for handling.</p>
<p>[United Press International, London, dispatch on the 11th] It is reported that if the planned new Moscow talks cannot break the deadlock, and the Berlin blockade continues, the Western countries are prepared to bring the Berlin crisis to the United Nations. The Western countries, especially the United States, believe that the Berlin blockade directly violates Article 2 of the United Nations Charter (United Nations member states shall settle disputes by peaceful means). The BBC's diplomatic analyst said that Western envoys will try to hold another meeting with Premier Stalin to discuss the situation in Berlin. The Western envoys in Moscow will immediately try to hold another meeting with Soviet officials. They may again consult with Stalin, reporting that the four-power military commanders cannot reach an agreement on all the details based on the principles decided in the previous Moscow talks. At the same time, they will directly urge the highest Soviet authorities to pay attention to the fact that the Soviet officials responsible for Berlin have failed to prevent the current wave of riots.</p>
<p>[United Press International, Washington, dispatch on the 11th] Authoritative sources said today that the United Kingdom and the United States are currently working together to resist the Soviet Union's attempt to seize the power of Western Europe. The reason for this is that the West believes that the Soviet-sponsored riots in Berlin are just a prelude to the Soviet Union's destruction of the Marshall Plan and its seizure of political power in Germany and France. It is said that the strategy of Britain and the United States in dealing with all Soviet actions in political propaganda is "power against power, words against words." Authoritative sources also listed the following new developments as evidence that Britain and the United States have risen up in anger: (1) The U.S. 35th advance force has arrived in Gibraltar and will join the powerful British Mediterranean Fleet. (2) London reports that significant progress has been made in the U.S. military cooperation plan with the Western European Alliance countries. (3) U.S. Secretary of Defense Forrestal is seeking to allocate $103 million from the Treasury to increase U.S. aircraft production.</p>

<h3>Record of Behind-the-Scenes Discussions Among Major Powers During the Initial Stage of the "January 28th Incident": First Public Release of Files by the U.S. State Department</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 10th] The U.S. State Department today released for the first time two volumes of diplomatic files regarding behind-the-scenes discussions among major powers during the initial conflict between China and Japan in Northeast China in 1932, titled "U.S. Diplomatic Relations, 1932." It fully describes matters in the Far East, with thousands of documents, including records of diplomatic conversations and private talks between U.S. diplomatic officials and high-ranking Chinese officials regarding Japan.</p>
<p>The State Department stated that the release of these documents aims to provide a deeper understanding of the causes of World War II, as they detail the various efforts made in the early stages of the Sino-Japanese conflict to prevent Japanese aggression. According to the records, Japan's expansion of military activities in Northeast China and its attack on Shanghai made its aggressive ambitions even more apparent. The records released today largely describe how then-U.S. Secretary of State Henry Stimson worked to gain international support for the principles stipulated in his January 7, 1932, enunciation of the U.S. non-recognition policy. Stimson also worked to uphold treaties supporting China's territorial and administrative integrity. Of particular note is the record of a long-distance telephone conversation between Stimson and then-British Prime Minister Ramsay MacDonald in January 1932, which shows that the U.S. and Britain were greatly concerned about the conflict in Shanghai. However, apart from sending notes to China and Japan, no coordinated action was taken. While the records urged various countries to form a strong diplomatic united front, they did not suggest implementing economic or military sanctions against Japan. Conversations between then-U.S. Minister to China Nelson Johnson and Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, T.V. Soong, Wellington Koo, and other high-ranking Chinese officials are also found in the two volumes of files released today. Generally speaking, these two volumes of documents can provide a deep understanding of the situation at the time and a further understanding of China's circumstances at the time.</p>
<h3>Seeds of the U.S.-Japan War Sprouted Early: Grew to Stimson Letter</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 11th] Former U.S. Ambassador to Japan Joseph Grew and his staff had already recognized the possibility of war between the U.S. and Japan as early as 1932. The State Department released some documents on the 11th under the titles "U.S. Diplomatic Relations" Volumes 3 and 4, including a letter from Grew to Secretary of State Stimson dated August 26, 1932. It stated: "Although I do not believe that any small incident or lack of patience can currently trigger a U.S.-Japan war, we should be aware that the national mood in Japan is quite dangerous. A war mentality has been created among the Japanese public, similar to what the German militarists did in 1914. The Japanese armed forces were created for war, and they are fearless and welcome the arrival of war. The Japanese military has never failed and possesses unlimited confidence, so we should look ahead to future developments. The Japanese military intends to expand and modernize, so it hopes to use the current crisis to obtain funding. Therefore, it must first find a possible powerful enemy. China has long been an enemy, but it has been weak for a long time. The Soviet Union does not seem to be belligerent, so the Japanese army has set its sights on the United States, regarding it as a potential enemy to achieve its goals. Many officials in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs are subject to the army, so some propaganda is issued by the ministry." Grew's letter included a memorandum from Military Attaché Lieutenant Colonel McKinley, which stated, "Japan's military production is increasing rapidly and is still continuing. Japan may be preparing for friction with the international community, but it seems more likely to confront the Soviet Union. The reason for its intensified activities may not be merely to clear the Northeast and conflict with China; its momentum seems to indicate that Japan has greater ambitions. Because the army is frantically preparing for war, a war must be fought, otherwise its power and prestige will be lost.

<h3>Important Resolutions of the Flour Industry Association: Each Factory Should Deposit Gold Bullion and Foreign Exchange in National Banks</h3>

The meeting passed a temporary important motion proposed by Chairman Du. The case was to support the government's currency reform policy. On the same day, all affiliated factories should be notified to deposit their gold, U.S. dollars, and foreign exchange in the Central Bank or the Bank of Communications, but the government should provide convenience to each factory when it needs it in the future. The association also discussed many important cases: (1) The Social Affairs Bureau ordered each factory to open flour supply to the market at the price of 8.19. Since the government's currency reform, each factory affiliated to the association has been able to abide by the power order and supply the market as needed. At present, due to the problem of warehouse receipts, the market is full of floating flour, and the market price is lower than the factory's disk, so few customers open flour to the flour factory, but each factory has prepared to do its best to supply as much as possible at any time. (2) The Social Affairs Bureau ordered the government to handle food consumption frugally and ordered 85 pounds of flour to be made from 100 pounds of wheat. It was resolved that the association should sincerely support the government's food saving policy and strictly abide by the saving measures promulgated by the Ministry.

Starting next week, the central task of the Supervisor's Office will be to regulate supplies, and detailed measures will be announced within days.

At present, there are a number of supplies at the North Station, knowing that they are urgently needed by other ports, but in order to prevent other planned supplies from escaping from this city, they have to be prohibited from being exported together.

<h3>No Profit: Shortage of Western Medicines: Merchants Plan to Request Price Adjustment</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] Since the implementation of price limits, the market situation of Western medicines in this city has formed a shortage situation, such as penicillin needles, which are extremely difficult to purchase. According to people in the Western medicine industry, because the price limit is too low, it is not enough to cover the cost.

In addition, such as saccharin, the cost per hearing, including taxes, is 26.5 yuan, while the price limit is only 25.3 yuan. Under such circumstances, merchants are unwilling to import goods from foreign countries, and smuggled goods have also disappeared recently because there is no profit to be made. Therefore, the market only relies on existing stocks for support, and the supply is in great shortage. It is said that Western medicine merchants plan to request the authorities to consider adjusting the price limit.</p>

<h3>Five Hundred Li in Northern Henan</h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent for This Newspaper Ling Songshou</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Report from Shashi, 3rd Day by Airmail] Since last autumn, when the communist Chen Geng's troops crossed the Yellow River and infiltrated the Funiu Mountain area, northern Henan has maintained a relatively well-off situation for the past year, amidst the raging flames of war burning on all sides.</p>
<p>The several large-scale battles of attack and defense at Tangyin, Anyang, and Xinxiang (six times) have tempered the people of northern Henan to calmly face the direct threat of weaving disputes; however, today the people of northern Henan indirectly bear the heavier burden imposed on them by the war in another respect.</p>
<p>Although the communist army currently in northern Henan has many units, their actual strength is very weak. The core unit is the 14th Column of Xu Xiangqian's troops, but it is only a small part. The remaining units, such as the New 9th Regiment, the New 10th Regiment, and the 46th, 47th, 49th, and 52nd Regiments, are just reorganizations of local teams, with a total number of less than 10,000 people. Recently, apart from the 41st and 42nd Brigades of the 14th Column, which were originally based near Hua County and have gradually moved to the vicinity of Fengqiu, the remaining communist troops are only looting materials, destroying transportation, and carrying out their life of roaming. From the communist perspective, northern Henan is currently not a major battlefield, but an important supply base. After Chen Geng infiltrated the western Henan mountains, they strategically gained an advantage, but the supply problem is their fatal wound. They cannot survive by relying on the mountains. According to recent intelligence, the communists have built a branch road westward from Handan on the Beijing-Hankou Railway, passing through Wu'an and reaching She County, and connecting it with a highway passing through Lucheng, Gaoping, and Jincheng in Shanxi Province and reaching Qinyang in northern Henan, and then southward, passing the Yellow River from Beibaipo (belonging to Meng County) on the north bank and leading to Luoyang. Handan is the military center of the communist Hebei-Henan-Shanxi border area. This road is quite important for the supply of communist arms and ammunition in western Henan, but apart from military supplies, they can only rely on northern Henan for food and clothing—especially materials that are lacking in the communist areas, such as electrical materials, cotton yarn, and Western medicines. Here, the reporter is willing to kindly point out one or two facts to the relevant authorities in northern Henan, which the reporter heard from the people. Of course, we hope that these are not facts.</p>
<p>Xinxiang</p>
<p>This is the heartland of northern Henan. It is said that the market is very chaotic. When I first arrived in Xinxiang and talked to friends, I expressed that Xinxiang's situation of being surrounded by communist bandits on all sides was too unstable. He said, "The Eighth Route Army won't attack Xinxiang!" "Why?" I asked quickly. He casually told me, "If the Eighth Route Army captures Xinxiang, they will lose a market for exchange." We can take the example of Zhang, the former section chief of the Xinxiang County government, who used military supplies to aid the communists.</p>
<p>In western northern Henan, people almost all know that Wu Zhi County is also a place where the communists exchange for the materials they need. The reporter confirmed a rumor from relevant sources: the Wu Zhi County magistrate was ill, and the magistrate's wife personally took charge of collecting "taxes" on materials transported from the communist area. Because of the floods in northern Henan, the reporter did not have the opportunity to visit Wu Zhi to ask whether there were any materials being transported out in addition to the materials being transported in.</p>
<p>Jiaozuo</p>
<p>Is an isolated island. Coal cannot be transported eastward, so it can only be transported northward. Of course, the communist area is less than ten li away from Jiaozuo in the west. In fact, it is always difficult to prevent the communists from using the grain they most need on this isolated island to exchange for coal, because after all, there are people in Jiaozuo, and people must eat. However, the people of Jiaozuo are not unaware that there are many small communist arsenals in the Taihang Mountains.</p>
<p>Before Luoyang fell to the communists, the Bian-Luo-Zheng line lay across the banks of the Yellow River, and the situation still looked presentable. Moreover, the Longhai Railway could sometimes reach Xuzhou. Therefore, at that time, the military authorities did not pay much attention to northern Henan. Every time Bian-Luo-Zheng was in trouble, there was an order to abandon northern Henan. Anyang and Jiaozuo were the first targets to be abandoned. When Chen (Yi) and Liu (Bocheng)'s heavy troops directly attacked Xinzheng this spring after the battle in western Henan, and Zhengzhou was in imminent danger, even Xinxiang was preparing to take necessary measures to retreat and hold the bridgehead on the north bank of the Yellow River. In the midst of all this, General Li Zhenqing, the commander of a certain division of the garrison in northern Henan, was indispensable. In</p>
<p>Northern Henan</p>
<p>His division is the core unit. He repeatedly and earnestly petitioned the highest authorities, explaining the importance of northern Henan, and only then was today's northern Henan preserved. In such a large area in northern Henan, he was able to allocate troops to defend the isolated city of Anyang in the north and the isolated point of Jiaozuo in the west, becoming two tentacles extending outwards from Xinxiang towards the Taihang Mountains, and further shielding Henan. Otherwise, if northern Henan were shrouded in a red atmosphere, today's isolated island of Bian-Zheng would be a different situation. Not only that, although the situation in Bian-Zheng is bad, it is still a valuable fortress in the current Central Plains war situation. However, if northern Henan had been abandoned in the first place, it would be difficult to supply the troops stationed in Henan today. For the past year, what we can control on the Longhai Line are only a few cities and county towns. Military supplies and grain are mostly borne by northern Henan. This is the first heavy burden on the shoulders of the people of northern Henan today.</p>
<p>The northwest of northern Henan is all mountainous, and the grain production on the plains in the southeast is also very limited. Even in peacetime, it cannot be self-sufficient. Moreover, among the 25 county towns in northern Henan, only Yuanwu and Yangwu counties can control the entire county. Eighteen counties can enter the territory to implement government orders (of which four counties cannot even enter the city). The rest, such as Jiyuan, Qinyang, Meng, Wen, She, and Wu'an counties, are all occupied by the communists. What we can control is not very large. In addition, natural disasters almost always plague northern Henan every year, and the communists take advantage of their roaming actions to loot grain everywhere. The countryside is empty, so the grain shortage among the people in northern Henan is already a serious problem, let alone the public grain and military grain that the government wants to collect? However, northern Henan has not let down the government after all. The grain for the troops stationed in northern and southern Henan has been supplied bit by bit in a squeezing state, although the people have long been eating black bread and corn to survive.</p>
<p>Public Grain</p>
<p>Administrative agencies can do without lights (such as the Xiuwu County government) or newspapers (such as the Xinxiang County government), but the expenses of administrative agencies at all levels are always needed. Although the people eat black bread and corn, black bread and corn are also grain! In this situation, northern Henan, with the cooperation of the military and civilians, launched a grain grabbing campaign against the communists. In order to maintain the needs of the people, county governments with strength often lead the people to the countryside to grab the public grain of the communists, such as Xiuwu County Magistrate Xu Wentao, who often guerilla outside, waiting for the communist loopholes, and then leading the people to transport the grain that was originally robbed by the communists.</p>
<p>Here, the reporter should introduce General Li Zhenqing. He is a general supported by countless people in northern Henan. His shadow is engraved in the hearts of every person in northern Henan. He is nicknamed "Li Iron Head."</p>
<p>Under his leadership, he launched two</p>
<p>Grain grabbing campaigns, which alleviated the grain shortage in the Qinpan area this spring. Since Zhengzhou, in Xinxiang, in Xiuwu, in Jiaozuo, in any place in northern Henan that the reporter has visited, the people know General Li. They know: without General Li, northern Henan would have long been the communist world; without General Li, this year's spring famine would never have been overcome! Li Zhenqing's maneuver warfare, aimed at the communist roaming, has a popular song among the communist troops in northern Henan: "I'm not worried about the sky, I'm not worried about the earth, I'm just afraid of meeting Li Iron Head!" Recently, a certain brigade of General Li's troops circled around the plain area in western northern Henan, and fought all the way to Puyang in southern Hebei, capturing a lot of loot. Unfortunately, the reporter only met Li once in Zhengzhou. When the reporter arrived in northern Henan, Li had already flown to Nanjing on official business, otherwise meeting and talking would have added a lot to this manuscript.</p>
<p>In addition, there is another thing about Li that is worth mentioning. He pays special attention to the training, equipment, and use of local teams. All sectors in northern Henan unanimously acknowledge that the ability of the northern Henan teams has been greatly enhanced since Li's reorganization. Li used the repair shop attached to the Zhongfu Coal Mine in Jiaozuo, using existing power, and combined it into a small arsenal. Now this factory can produce 30 light machine guns per month, specifically for equipping the teams.</p>
<p>The people of northern Henan bear heavy burdens on their shoulders, and in addition to the heavy burdens, there are many external obstacles that make the burden even heavier. The reporter chatted with Qian Jingzhong, the administrative commissioner of the Fourth Administrative District of Henan Province stationed in Xinxiang. He said: Since the Anti-Japanese War, he has been acting as a scarificer for the people of northern Henan, but today, telling the people to bleed is no longer a question of whether it hurts, but whether they have any blood left.</p>
<h3>The Huangdu Shen Woman's Violent Death Case: Authorities Order Thorough Investigation and Strict Punishment</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Qingpu Bureau, 10th] The case of Shen Pang Guiying from Tangwan, Huangdu, who died violently after being illegally detained by the district office, was re-examined by forensic doctor Xuan Fang of the Jiangsu High Court on August 28th. The autopsy report arrived in the county on the 8th, determining the cause of death as "rape leading to death," causing public outrage. Wang Jiyuan, the Chief Trial Judge of the county's judicial office, and Judge Wang Zhengyu stated: "Since the rape aspect of the case has been determined, there is already a clue. The identity of the main culprit is currently under investigation. All aspects of the case will be handled fairly in accordance with the spirit of the judiciary." Luo Zhanyun, the leader of the Third Platoon of the First Militia Company (stationed at the Qinglong District Office), is a major suspect in the case. In mid-August, when the provincial government's supervisory team arrived in Qingpu, they learned of this case and another case of rape involving a rural woman surnamed Fan (in which Luo is also a major suspect). Due to the poor discipline of the troops and the uproar in local public opinion, the provincial security command was telegraphed to dismiss Zeng Guoheng, the company commander. Luo was ordered to be detained by the county government and ordered to conduct a thorough investigation and strict handling within a time limit to rectify discipline and appease public anger. He has now been transferred to the judicial office for detention and investigation. Personnel related to the district office are also under investigation by the judicial office. This public case will soon be clarified.</p>
<p>[Another Report] Regarding the rumor that Liao Bin, the trial judge in the Qingpu Huangdu Shen woman's case, was dismissed and investigated, the Jiangsu High Court ordered a replacement of the trial judge in the county judicial office on August 18th. Wang Jiyuan took over as the new Chief Trial Judge. Liao was not dismissed and investigated. Because the internal inspection officials and clerks of the judicial office suddenly resigned and fled, Liao, as the original trial judge in the case, advocated that the High Court send a forensic doctor for examination. His transfer was due to unqualified experience.</p>
<h3>Tomb of the Fragrant Concubine: The Dome of the Tomb Collapses</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Lanzhou Bureau, 11th] A visitor from southern Xinjiang said: The dome of the Tomb of the Fragrant Concubine in the eastern suburbs of Kashgar suddenly collapsed on August 22nd. Deputy Commander Zhao Xiguang personally went to inspect it. Note: The Tomb of the Fragrant Concubine is a famous historical site in southern Xinjiang. The dome of the tomb was magnificent and solemn, but its spectacular appearance has now been lost.</p>
<h3>Militarization of Autonomous Personnel: Yongkang County Implements First</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Hangzhou Bureau, 11th] The magistrate of Yongkang County, Zhejiang, believes that the township heads and other autonomous personnel in the county are all wealthy gentry who are often coerced by bandits, acting perfunctorily, resulting in the failure of government orders to be implemented and the difficulty in achieving effective bandit suppression. Therefore, he requested permission to use retired army officers above the rank of lieutenant colonel as district chiefs, major or captain as township heads, and lieutenant or second lieutenant as township squad deputies or general affairs officers, with soldiers serving as bao chiefs or bao squad deputies. The provincial government, in addition to the restoration of the district office needing to be submitted for verification, has approved the adjustment of baojia personnel to be handled accordingly. This is the beginning of the militarization of township autonomous personnel in Zhejiang Province.</p>
<h3>Domestic Cats in Qin'an County, Gansu Province: Confirmed to be Infected with Kala-azar</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Lanzhou Bureau, 11th] Two domestic cats in Qin'an County, Gansu Province, were recently found to be infected with Kala-azar. Liu Weitong, the director of the Northwest Hygiene Experimental Institute, believes that this is a significant development in the transmission route of Kala-azar because there are no such reports in the medical literature of various countries. After sending personnel to Qin'an for verification, Liu is now personally conducting detailed research.</p>
<h3>Naval and Army Warships in Dinghai: Begin Powerful Search and Seizure Operations</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Ningbo Bureau, 11th] In order to thoroughly suppress the bandit gangs of Xu Xiaoyu and Wang Rongxuan who have fled to the islands of Dinghai, Chen Daqing, the Deputy Director of Pacification of the province, specially went to Dinghai yesterday with Mao Sen, the Director of the Provincial Police Security Department, and others to personally supervise the suppression, and transferred four elite regiments of the 75th Division to accompany them. After arriving in Dinghai, Director Chen decided to strictly blockade the bandits' lairs with warships, and ordered the prohibition of all commercial ships from sailing within one week starting from the 10th, and also prohibited civilian ships from approaching the bandit suppression area. Another report: The naval and army warships in Dinghai have begun island-by-island powerful searches in order to drive the bandits lurking on various islands to concentrate on one island and annihilate them in one fell swoop. Fierce encirclement and suppression operations are gradually unfolding.</p>
<h3>Sun Pusheng Case in Jiangyin: Township Head Niu Summoned</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Jiangyin Bureau, 10th] Sun Guanyin, from Baizhangli, Xiyangqiao, Mazhen Township, accused Niu Yusheng, the head of Mazhen Township, of falsely accusing his son, Sun Pusheng, of colluding with bandits and killing him while trying to escape. The local court accepted the case of Niu Yusheng abusing his power and killing innocent people. On July 31st, the local prosecutor's office conducted an interrogation and ordered Sun Guanyin to transport his son's coffin to the city for examination within seven days. More than a month has passed, and it is said that the Sun family has been persuaded and no longer wants to pursue the matter, so the coffin has not been transported to the city. On the 9th, the prosecutor's office summoned Township Head Niu to court. He flatly denied killing Sun Pusheng, stating that Sun Pusheng was secretly colluding with bandits and had reports from victims as evidence, and was killed while trying to escape after being arrested. The court stated that the case still needs further investigation and ordered the defendant, Township Head Niu, to post bail and be summoned for further questioning at a later date.</p>
<h3>Legislator Cheng Siyuan: Accused of Seducing and Raping</h3>
<p>Zheng Jie Calls for Support for Justice</p>
<p>[Report from Our Nanjing Bureau, 10th] Zheng Jie, who has been publishing advertisements in the Central Daily News in Nanjing for days, claiming that Cheng Siyuan, a legislator from Guangxi, seduced and raped his fiancée, Shi Hong, and appealing to Kuomintang comrades and people from all walks of life, held a press conference on the 10th. Zheng looked haggard, but his thinking and speech were still very calm. In a low, clear tone, he described the twists and turns of his love and engagement with Shi Hong, and Cheng's pursuit of her with improper means and capturing her. He accused Cheng of being immoral and depraved, which is a great irony to China's democratic constitutionalism and reformed politics. He said that Shi Hong's inner remorse and pain have reached the extreme, and his love for Shi is still firm, without any unforgiveness, but he will not hesitate to make any sacrifices to prevent Shi's destruction. Finally, he said: He has filed a lawsuit with the Capital District Court, although he knows that the court and the law cannot provide any protection for Shi or impose sanctions on Cheng, but human society's morality and public opinion have its own fair standards. After Zheng finished his report, a representative of the "Support Association for Zheng Jie's Fiancée Shi Hong's Seduced and Raped by Cheng Siyuan Incident" stepped forward to speak, calling on the news media to uphold justice.</p>

During the Anti-Japanese War, he presided over school affairs and moved several times, all of which he was able to handle with ease, so that he could return to normal. His perseverance and enthusiasm are commendable and should be commended by a clear order to show excellence.</p>

<h3>Regarding the Collection of Space Reservation Fees: If the Family is Poor, Admission is Still Permitted Even if the Fee is Not Paid</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Bureau] The Municipal Education Bureau previously allowed schools in the city to collect space reservation fees from students at the end of the term because the mobility of students in the city's schools was quite large during the Luan period, so as to calculate the number of places and facilitate enrollment. The Municipal Government recently received a letter from a student's parent requesting that the collection of space reservation fees be corrected. The Education Bureau has recently issued a notice to all schools stating that schools should still give priority to facilitating the admission of students who did not pay the space reservation fee in the previous semester due to poor family circumstances or other legitimate reasons.</p>
<h3>Private Schools Should Set Up Free Places: The Education Bureau Decides to Supervise the Implementation</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Bureau] Some private primary and secondary schools in this city have still not complied with the regulations of the Education Bureau to implement the 25% free quota.

<h3>Regarding the Demand for Adjustment of Public Education Salaries: Professors of National Universities in Shanghai: Telegraphed to the Central Government Today in Response; The Jiaotong University Professor Association Sent Letters and Telegrams to the Whole Country Yesterday for Emergency Appeal</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Bureau] Following the professors of national colleges and universities in the capital requesting the adjustment of salaries for public education personnel nationwide, professors from eight national colleges and universities in this city, including Jiaotong, Ji, Fudan, Tongji, Shangyi, Shangshang, Yinzhuan, and Wusong Merchant Shipping, also jointly made the same request, and also requested that the subsidy for professors' academic research be adjusted from 20 Gold Yuan to 100 Yuan. The telegram is currently being drafted and will be sent to the Executive Yuan, Legislative Yuan, and other courts today.</p>
<p>Jiaotong University Appeals: Experts Correct</p>
<p>[Another Report] The Professor Association of National Jiaotong University in this city believes that the government's reform of the currency system has still failed to improve the treatment of public education personnel in the slightest, and it is really an excessive disregard for the lives of the people. They specially telegraphed the National Congress Representative Friendship Association, the Legislative Yuan, the Executive Yuan, the Supervisory Yuan, and the Ministry of Education in Nanjing for an urgent appeal. They requested timely consideration and prompt correction in order to improve the lives of general public education personnel. They also sent letters to professor associations of national colleges and universities across the country for liaison, hoping to give support. The text of the telegram stated:</p>
<p>Unanimously Support Currency Reform</p>
<p>"This government's reform of the currency system, to save inflation and stabilize the social economy, is an emergency and necessary measure and there is no doubt it should be unanimously supported to overcome difficulties. However, the foundation of the social economy lies in the improvement of general life. In the decade of war, most people have been mired in deep water and misery, especially public education personnel.</p>
<p>Intellectuals are the Backbone</p>
<p>Public education personnel are the grassroots cadres of the national government and are all intellectuals. The state of mind is no different from a pillar in the midst of a raging river. Therefore, whether government affairs can be clarified and whether thought can be corrected depends on this establishment. In recent years, corruption has been rampant and turmoil has not stopped. The reason is based on this. The treatment of public education personnel was sufficient before the Anti-Japanese War. Payment at an 80% discount during the initial stage of the Anti-Japanese War was barely maintainable. Afterwards, inflation increased and treatment decreased. Initially, there were no complaints in silence, but then there was no way to live, and it has become the phenomenon of today. It is regrettable that this currency reform has been too negligent in the treatment of public education personnel. The new currency and silver yuan have already been halved, and now there are discounts of 20% and 10%.</p>
<p>Treatment is Low: Truly Lamentable</p>
<p>Therefore, the low treatment is truly lamentable. Without corrective measures, the failure to improve the efficiency of government affairs, and the failure to completely stabilize society, the government cannot shirk its responsibility. People of similar circumstances could not bear to remain silent. They highly hoped that all measures in the future must extend to the grassroots level. There should be a clear understanding of improving people's livelihood. The unreasonable regulations for the treatment of public education this time should be promptly reconsidered and promptly corrected in order to remedy the situation."</p>
<h3>"Carrying Glory on Oars": Vice President Chen Speaks to the Education Circle: Education and Economy; Citizens and School Teachers Jointly Present a Banner to Pay Respect</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Bureau] The Municipal Education Bureau invited Chen Lifu, the Vice President of the Legislative Yuan, to give a speech to the principals and teachers of public and private primary and secondary schools in the city at 4:00 PM yesterday in the auditorium of Zhendan University. Gu Yuxiu, the President of the Political University, Hu Wenyao, the President of Zhendan University, and hundreds of other principals and teachers of public and private primary and secondary schools in the city attended. First, Li Ximou, the Acting Director of the Education Bureau, gave a speech to introduce him. Then, Vice President Chen talked about his feelings about attending the World Moral Re-Armament Movement conference in the United States. Vice President Chen said: Education and economy are interconnected. Developed education can promote economic development and industrial and commercial prosperity. Conversely, economic development and national wealth can make education flourish. The United States has a large number of university students and complete facilities because the country is stable and wealthy. In contrast, our country's education and economy have failed to cooperate. Eighty percent of the country's population are farmers, and they are not placed at the center of all problems. Only the deformed development of urban commerce is promoted, without regard to the rural areas that produce the most. For example, tea and silk are famous products of our country, but we do not know how to train talents and improve them to export in large quantities and earn foreign exchange, resulting in the gradual loss of our world market position. Vice President Chen's speech lasted for one hour and was full of warnings. After the speech, the Joint Association of Teachers of Public Schools in the city presented Vice President Chen with a banner that reads, "Carrying Glory on Oars," and Vice President Chen accepted it with a smile.</p>

<h3>Public School Teachers</h3>
<p>— Jingwen</p>
<p>The term "public school teachers" is probably a product of the post-war era, as it seems that in the past, people rarely connected these two occupations. Back then, civil servants were generally referred to as "those who eat from the government," and a Zhongshan suit and a black briefcase were a special symbol of middle and upper-level civil servants. Especially in small inland cities that had not seen much of the world, the title "eating from the government" seemed to carry a special status, and it sounded quite impressive.</p>
<p>Teachers, although not as "prestigious" as civil servants, had a higher moral standing than "those who eat from the government." Although the lives of these two professions were not particularly affluent at the time, they were still desirable jobs for ordinary people, because even if they weren't rich, they could at least have a stable life. If you had no ambitions and were genuinely interested in the life of a "public servant" or a lonely desk, it was possible for it to become your lifelong career.</p>
<p>I think that if we use occupational distinctions to measure the rise and fall of a country, then the progress and decline of the public school teacher profession should be a suitable measure. Why? Because these two professions represent the stable force of the intellectual backbone of a country. Industrial labor is undoubtedly the ultimate deciding factor in a country's economic strength, but to elevate the results of industrial labor into a country's culture and civilization, we must not only focus on production labor but also further support mental laborers. Ancient slave societies could also produce aristocratic cultures, but this was ultimately abnormal. In a society where physical and mental labor are not developed in a balanced manner, the civilization it displays, no matter how brilliant it may seem, will ultimately be unsustainable.</p>
<p>Since the impact of the Industrial Revolution spread throughout the world, the social structure of various countries has undergone tremendous changes, and the most significant feature is the existence of the so-called intellectual class. Prior to this, intellectuals were limited to a few officials, monks, scholars, and philosophers. Although they had their own special status in ancient societies, they did not have a collective social status. The attainment of social status as an intellectual class by intellectuals will inevitably occupy an important page in the future history of world culture.</p>
<p>The so-called intellectual class, although it cannot be strictly called a class, has become the real stabilizing force in modern society precisely because it does not have a fixed, narrow class nature. In terms of occupational categories, the so-called white-collar class is more than enough to represent the representative layer of the intellectual class in any society. Public school teachers are the most powerful link in this representative layer. Although those who constitute the intellectual class are not limited to public school teachers, in any modern and progressive country, the occupational status and quantity of public school teachers will inevitably be at the forefront of other intellectual occupations. Although the social status of other so-called freelancers outside of public school teachers is also extremely important, a prominent writer or poet does not necessarily represent the universal cultural development of a country. For example, in serfdom-era Russia, great writers emerged one after another, but the general cultural level of Russian society at the time was far behind that of Western European countries. Conversely, in a society where the intellectual class can achieve universal development, even if no great thinkers or poets have yet emerged, the cultural level of that society will inevitably achieve a more balanced development, and the lives of its general population will also be more stable and prosperous. This is the case in the United States today, and the United Nations is also approaching this state.</p>
<p>However, the lives of public school teachers in our country after the war have been devastated and hit hard. Not only have they struggled on the brink of starvation for a long time, but there is also a great tendency for them to be unable to survive. The country's economic strength is perhaps weak, which may be a fact, but looking around the situation, it is appropriate to say that we should worry about inequality rather than scarcity.</p>
<p>Although I have had connections with both of these professions, my motivation for writing this short article is by no means out of selfish thoughts. Poor civil servants and poor teachers have become famous for being poor in recent years, and their living conditions are sometimes inferior to those who work hard with their own hands and feet. The lives of physical laborers should naturally be continuously improved, but the lives of mental laborers cannot be ignored either. The prosperity and development of a country must rely on the balance of life among its social members. Even in countries that advocate class societies, they spare no effort to improve the lives of intellectuals and raise the social status of the white-collar class in order to integrate physical and mental labor. Why are we instead degrading the intellectuals who are the backbone of society?</p>
<p>Perhaps some people say that no public school teachers have been heard of starving to death so far, and no one has gone to the office shirtless. But this is like a lung patient whose internal decay may not immediately be apparent on the outside. In fact, teachers who wear their wives' trousers to class and civil servants who commit suicide due to poverty have already been discovered.</p>
<h3>A Record of Passing Through the Pass</h3>
<p>— Shi Shufan</p>
<p>The road is unclear in the stony and barren land,</p>
<p>The number of postal stations is like announcing names.</p>
<p>An old hut sits at the pass,</p>
<p>Is it serving tea or guarding the border?</p>
<p>Wind-blown sand and earth cook yellow rice,</p>
<p>Playing on the hills, the true face is revealed.</p>
<p>Evening clouds of She County, crystal of Changhua,</p>
<p>Who asks the lone traveler about his journey?</p>
<p>Last night, I ate my fill of pumpkin rice,</p>
<p>With a few slices of autumn pear and half a cup of wine.</p>
<p>Heaven fills the traveler with joy,</p>
<p>And a handful of peanuts on the way out of the pass.</p>
<p>Year after year, waking and drunk on the road,</p>
<p>Forgetting my meals, my country, and my home.</p>
<p>Suddenly, a great fury surged in my heart,</p>
<p>And the mountains were covered in white sesame flowers.</p>
<p>A row of bean flowers bright by the stream fence,</p>
<p>As the red sorghum ripens and the grass grows again.</p>
<p>With disheveled hair, wearing blue cloth clothes,</p>
<p>Pity her small feet managing the farm.</p>
<p>Heavily armed, the evening tower is now empty,</p>
<p>The autumn sounds in the alley connect with dreams.</p>
<p>No wonder my beard is half gray,</p>
<p>The light of the journey has also faded from the red of the past.</p>
<p>Autumn reeds on the sandy path, dew turns to smoke,</p>
<p>A few willows stand beside the abandoned city.</p>
<p>The mountain sleeps, the stream is sick, the stars are weak,</p>
<p>Even the deep ridges of the mountains are pitiful in the moonlight.</p>
<p>Travel-worn clothes with scattered spots,</p>
<p>Changing direction, the clear stream sends me back by the moon.</p>
<p>Waking up in the tall building, it's hard to sleep,</p>
<p>The night tide floats the pagoda, the mountains are scattered.</p>
<h3>People Who Can't Get Enough to Eat</h3>
<p>— Suo Bei</p>
<p>The Chinese people are very "extreme" when it comes to eating. Among the recipes of all countries in the world, ours is the most astonishing: from grass skins and tree roots to chicken, duck, fish, and shark fins, nothing is omitted.</p>
<p>Today, one-third of the people are eating tree roots, grass skins, and even human flesh, while another fraction of the population indulges in delicacies of every kind. Whether it's a happy occasion or a funeral, a grand feast is a must, not only to be full and drunk but also to have a bloated stomach. Spending half a day on eating is not considered a waste of time, and it should be that way.</p>
<p>Westerners ask "How are you?" when they meet. We ask "Have you eaten?" Allied personnel working in China during the Anti-Japanese War also picked up the habit of treating people to meals. According to them, "In China, anything can be accomplished by eating and drinking."</p>
<p>Therefore, whether before or after victory, in China's major cities (especially Shanghai), people with money could eat whatever they wanted, no less than in a "golden yuan country." World Games athletes who had to bring their own food abroad felt uncomfortable and were immediately liberated upon returning to Shanghai.</p>
<p>Even a small country like England has "eggs for everyone" and eats sparingly, saving the rest to sell abroad in exchange for foreign exchange. The Soviet Union, one of the two major powers, also practices thrift and saves money to build industries. But we have 17th-century production and 20th-century waste, eating crazily and desperately, without any regard for the actual effectiveness of food. The entire meaning of life is entrusted to the tongue. As a result, according to medical experts, the Chinese have larger and more fearful stomachs than Westerners, but the average lifespan is only thirty-two years.</p>
<p>The Chinese people's love of eating and excessive consumption has been evident since ancient times. Traditionally, prisoners on the execution ground must ask for a full meal before death to avoid becoming hungry ghosts. It can be said that even in death, they must eat! Furthermore, the seven necessities of life are all for eating. I don't understand whether we are like this because we have never been full in the past, or because we are eternally unable to get enough to eat.</p>
<p>It is Mid-Autumn Festival again. The rich in Shanghai will invariably push through the ranks of refugees and beggars before rushing into large restaurants to indulge in excessive drinking and eating to celebrate the festival. As for mooncakes with ham and egg yolks at home, they are naturally piled up like mountains.</p>
<p>Therefore, the authorities have another proposal to save peanuts and soybeans to exchange for foreign exchange. The rich will inevitably shake their heads, because they would rather eat the foreign exchange to fatten themselves.</p>
<p>In a peaceful and prosperous age, their eating habits and style are not "national health," let alone today?</p>
<h3>Quitting Smoking</h3>
<p>— Tanke</p>
<p>In order to show my determination and perseverance and to "prove myself" to my wife, I decided to quit smoking. I frantically smoked all the remaining five or six cigarettes in my pocket in one go and scrubbed my fingers, which had been yellowed by smoke, with soap and a brush. Although the smoke yellow on my fingers was not completely removed, I finally made up my mind to wash my hands and not smoke. Perhaps the action was a bit too much, as my wife laughed beside me. When I asked her why she was laughing, she didn't answer. Did she think I wouldn't know if she didn't say? It was clearly contemptuous and suspicious, as if saying, "Quit smoking? See if you can!"</p>
<p>Fine! No smoking no matter what. I even "swore by splashing water" in the bath at night. Half a day passed, and of course, nothing happened overnight.</p>
<p>The next morning, I reached into my pocket to pull out a cigarette, and the two words "quit smoking" immediately appeared in my mind. This was a self-warning, as if it were audible. But it didn't feel natural to me, like seeing the "No Smoking" sign in a movie theater. Friends came to chat, and when they saw that I didn't offer them cigarettes, they started inviting me to smoke. Although I declared that I had started quitting, they still diligently urged me to smoke. Watching them blow clouds and spit out mist, I naturally couldn't help but waver a little, but I just wouldn't smoke. That was it.</p>
<p>After my friends left, I looked at books and wrote something alone. Several times I reached into my pocket, and several times I reached out from my pocket to rummage through the drawer, but of course, there were no cigarettes. At this point, I was extremely annoyed. On normal days, I would immediately go buy cigarettes, but I had quit smoking, determination, perseverance, face...</p>
<p>I desperately tried to calm myself down. I tried to pull my attention to the books, but this was like forcing myself to fall asleep, with no effect at all. On the contrary, "smoke, smoke, smoke" kept jumping in my mind.</p>
<p>My wife patted me on the back:</p>
<p>"Smoke!"</p>
<p>She handed me a pack of cigarettes. I looked at the pack of cigarettes and stubbornly said the word "No." My wife had already sensed what was on my mind and whispered in my ear:</p>
<p>"Why are you being stubborn! Smoke! It would be even more embarrassing if you went to buy them yourself later!"</p>
<p>My quitting smoking, at</p>
<h3>False News</h3>
<p>— Gongsun Wu</p>
<p>A senior told me that the telegram "The Capital Falls, the Emperor Flees" in the Xinhai Revolution was fabricated by the Tianduo Newspaper in Shanghai. The newspaper issued an extra edition one day, printing these four characters in large font, claiming it was a telegram from Beijing, which caused a frenzy among the people. This fabricated news was immediately spread to various places, especially Hong Kong and Guangzhou, which led to the uprising in Guangdong. The owner of the Tianyi Newspaper, Mr. Li Wenqing from Nanhai, was credited for his contribution to the establishment of the Republic of China. Ten years later, he once served as the magistrate of Maoming, and so on. I believe that those who have contributed to the revolution must have people who love to tell stories to commend them. I regret that I have little knowledge and can only briefly describe what I have heard above. In the Xinhai Revolution, people knew that the Qing Dynasty was bound to perish, but when the revolutionary army was at a disadvantage, how could the capital fall? The masses did not think or ask. A few years ago, I learned that there were so-called "strategic news," which had a good name but were mostly fabricated. This is called spreading rumors. Spreading rumors is a means, and it depends on the purpose. However, during international wars, there are too many and chaotic false news from all sides, and people are gradually losing faith in it. If it is said that running a newspaper must have a special purpose, each newspaper has its own stance. Even if these newspapers do not spread rumors, their handling of news is almost without a single word that is not strategic. Newspapers record events, which are called contemporary history. Our ancestors attached great importance to historical writing. Now that the atmosphere has changed, do journalists still regard themselves as historians? The four elements of historical talent, historical knowledge, historical understanding, and historical morality, as advocated by Liu Zixuan and Zhang Shizhai, must not be regarded as outdated words. The word "report" comes from Japan, and our people compete to use it. I don't understand its meaning, but I only know that it is a verb, not the "way" of judo or tea ceremony.</p>
<h3>Excerpts from Yun Wenti's Orchid Minor Works Continued (Part Two)</h3>
<p>— Bai Jiao</p>
<p>Orchid and Chinese Orchid in Harmony</p>
<p>A person from Guangdong said to Yunjiansheng: "Reading your orchids and Chinese orchids is like drinking pure and fragrant wine. How did you achieve this?" Yunjiansheng said: "In the past, Emperor Gaozu of Tang said, 'The arena of fame and fortune is a battlefield of swords and spears!' This flower was originally in the mountains, enduring snow and ice. It was originally trouble-free, emitting fragrance and sending out its beauty. You happened to obtain it!"</p>
<p>Eternal Thoughts of Plum Blossoms</p>
<p>Differences in behavior and inconsistency in language, the fragrance of the nation suffers from war and fire. If you are truly open-minded, can we talk about the end of the year? Running around in the dust, competing for success and speed, alas, alas, there is no such thing in the depths of the clouds, but there is this evil!</p>
<p>Longevity</p>
<p>One is not too few, a hundred is not too many, so that ancient and modern people pay attention, and the future is satisfactory. So I clapped my hands with my clumsy wife and laughed outside the mundane world! Bai Jiao's drunken excitement.</p>
<p>Spring-Welcoming Plum Blossoms</p>
<p>In the past, a Taoist said, "No one can obtain this fortune in black and white, which causes illness." What is good about this Taoist? Fu Weng only entrusts his long-held heart!</p>
<p>Green Cloud Creation</p>
<p>Fu Weng has smoke coming out of his nose, nothing on his mind, beer in front of his eyes, and flowers blooming on paper, so that the monk is happy to praise! Presented to Reverend Hui as an offering.</p>
<p>Chinese Orchid</p>
<p>Zhang Huizi has a clean freak and lives alone in a room, with only a few things such as desks and bookshelves. She exclusively requests Bai Jiao's orchid calligraphy to decorate the wall. This painting is written for her, so that bees and butterflies may not be frivolous.</p>
<p>Wulin Immortal</p>
<p>Spreading fragrance with self-labor, with its own good looks, from summer to autumn, without sparing sweat, it has not changed since victory. This was inspired by drunkenness, flourishing after wine, and has not yet been appreciated. It should be returned!</p>
<p>Mountain Orchid</p>
<p>This orchid, if it goes down the mountain, is called Yemei by Shen Ji, and Baimei by Yunjian. How can it be superior in its natural elegance and far away in its silent depths? One can only sigh here. Like the owner of the Nine Bees Pavilion, longing for apotheosis, how peculiar!</p>
<p>Global Lotus Tripod</p>
<p>The king's body is large, and he laughs at the drawing work like chicken feet. Those who have never seen it will ridicule it.</p>
<p>It has the meaning of mountains and marshes, not the things of the wind and dust. The wise men of the past had this demeanor, but today they have no such spirit.</p>
<p>"Ink and brush are for playing, the matter is truly indestructible, the hand is lazy and the heart is diligent, the paper is high and the eyes are free from debt!" This is a sentence in a poem that this layman gave to a friend in the past. Reaching this realm, the art must be worth seeing. This work is inspired, not owed. Kao Ting said. (The End)</p>
