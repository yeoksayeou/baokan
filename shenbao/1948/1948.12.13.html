<h3>蚌宿會戰勝利關鍵　繫於李黃兵團會師　目前距離僅及三十華里</h3>
<p>〔本報蚌埠十二日電〕無可諱言，今日蚌宿戰塲之間，國軍正面臨一緊要關鍵，卽李黃兩兵團之會師是。此一關鍵打通，則南下兵團方面之問題極可能迎刃而解。南綫李延年兵團當面雖因匪之增援頑抗，村村設防，與日來天氣之較不利於空軍之活動，而似已形成陣地戰之趨向，但此非謂李黃之會師有若何困難，其影響所及，亦不過會師之時間不如一般所期望之速；而以戰局之發展趨勢論，南綫國軍刻正在有利之地勢下卽可完成對當面頑匪之圍殲部署，黃維兵團繼續向東南進展，正以强力壓迫澥河北岸之匪不得不墜入此國軍布成之包圍圈內，該兵團現正以穩紮穩打，步步為營之攻勢前進，使其部隊所到之處，卽為堅强之陣地，此因該部以雙堆集，大營集，羅集三大據點形成極穩之基地，不能隨便離却，故昨日匪曾在該部東南側據點大營集附近開一缺口，企圖誘黃兵團衝出，予以截擊；但黃兵團洞燭其奸，不為所惑，反以反包圍之行動，擊潰其一個國以上之兵力，迄昨日止，黃李兩兵團間之距離約為四十五華里上下，在兩兵團之全力進展下，會師之期自不在遠，而黃李兩兵團之會師，亦卽國軍在此戰場中佔得優勢之轉捩點。至於北綫之邱李孫三兵團，於予匪痛擊之餘，原被截斷之陣地，刻又呵成一氣。當面匪之攻擊，其目的僅係阻碍國軍不能迅速南下，以目前陳毅兵力之步砲，萬萬無圍擊此强大兵團之能力。於此吾人可明瞭者：共匪向以「一點兩面」戰術為其特長，然在今日蚌宿戰役中，彼等已完全忽略此點，而成「三點一面」之形勢，致在三大戰塲之前處處有所顧慮，失去主動，故一且李黃會師，南下兵團當面之匪固將不擊自潰，而疲殘之衆將極可能不能逃避於國軍夾擊以外。</p>
<p>〔本報蚌埠十二日電〕蚌宿戰塲之南綫，仍着着進展，刻雙方在此縱橫五十華里之戰塲中，所形成之戰爭行動，已非一為追擊一為阻擊，在匪軍方面，刻利用此地區內之無數村落，處處設防，欲藉「疏散配備」之戰術，一以避免空軍之轟炸，與砲火之射擊，一以阻得國軍之進擊，而牽延李黃兩兵團會師之時間；以國軍言，據今午所獲初步情報，李延年兵團之鉗形攻勢已逐漸變易為孤形，除在此弧形陣綫之前向小集（在新集包家集之間，相互距離均為十華里），包家集展開攻擊外，其左翼已延伸至仁和集之南側，今亦對該據點開始猛擊。此近三十華里之弧形戰綫，原為正對西北方行動，而目前之弧口已轉為對北偏西之方向。國軍此一戰略上趨勢，殆將着重左翼，使其繼續向北迂迴，以形成對當而頑抗之匪之兜殲。黃維兵團方面，昨續以大營集為重點（在澥河北岸），向東南進擊，期壓迫殘匪至澥河南岸，與李兵團合力圍勦；該兵團之陣地已擴展至王莊·朱莊（在大營集東偏南約五六華里）一綫，並擊潰匪一個團有餘。</p>
<p>〔本報蚌埠十二日電〕確息：劉匪乘黃維兵團向東南移動之際，昨起集中兵力向雙堆集以南猛犯，企圖將該兵團陣地截成兩段，據今晚剿總公報稱，激戰一晝夜後，今晨攻勢稍退，午問匪增援進犯，現正激戰中。</p>
<p>〔本報蚌埠十二日電〕剿總公布：李兵團右翼進展神速，今日連克新集，官塘廟，瓦　集等地，按瓦　集在新集西約八華里，李黃兵團陣地之距離已僅餘三十華里。</p>

<p>〔本報北平十二日電〕平綏東段戰况漸趨沉寂，新保安附近共匪經國軍强大部隊猛烈攻擊後，向東北山區敗逃，昨今兩日未敢蠢動。張垣國軍乘勝擴大戰果，昨午至今晨，對張垣東南老虎山及張垣西北烏拉哈過附近殘匪，展開攻擊，國軍士氣旺盛，刻正繼續掃蕩中。平綏車前昨兩日通南口，今日客貨車停駛，上午軍車通沙河。</p>

<h3>郭宗汾分析北方大局　能確保平津并　華北實有可爲　誰能拿到制高點就可操勝算</h3>
<p>〔本報北平十二日電〕華北剿總副總司令郭宗分對記者談，北平為北方文化城市，天津為華北工業中心，太原為北方兵工基地，只要此二點確保，華北實尙有可為，由天津起經北平，張坦迄大同一綫，為北方一堵大牆，今日此牆雖有局部塌陷，已不完整，但仍有其作用，共匪刻正傾其全力，欲推倒此牆，雙方決戰殆不可免。就國軍言，則此決戰地區愈近愈有利。長城綫上之關溝，為「隘道戰」區，誰能拿到制高點，誰就可操勝算。此次國軍據有關溝制高黑，共匪乃避在關溝竹戰，將兵力南移。談及太原戰事，郭氏稱：太原自日前在西北郊激戰後，戰况轉寂，該處每日經常有空軍飛臨偵炸，陳納德空運隊自十二日起飛幷機增加三班，以增强力量。郭氏最後稱，如能增兵萬人，太原局勢卽有開展可能。</p>

<h3>調查違反美利益委會　公布國務院密件　有關十年以前英日間外交關係</h3>
<p>〔中央社華盛頓十日電〕美衆院調查違反美國利益行動委員會，十日公布有關一九三八年在華日軍調動情形，與設明該時英日關係之秘密文件。按此文件盛傳十年前在國務院被竊，而被蘇聯間諜獲得，美駐日大使格魯於一九三八年二月十三日致國務卿赫爾之「最機密電報」中稱：英駐日大使向英政府作下列建議：（一）如繼續以作戰物資。金錢或任何其他方法援華，則將有害於英國之利益。（二）英政府應隨時留心促成和談，此舉可能使中國尙有復興之望。衆院今日共公布十二項文件，包括格魯之電報。據傳：此項文件，俱曾在國務院中被竊，卽為自供為共黨傳遞消息之張伯斯所獲得。按衆院調查違反美國利益行動委員會，共自張伯斯處搜出二百項文件，上項十二文件，不過為一部份而已。格魯之電報中謂：英大使克萊琪與日外相廣田某次會談時，廣田曾兩度因英方抗議日本之佔領香港附近若干小島，而大發雷霆。據格魯稱；克萊琪深慮日本所保證之對華無領土野心，可能隨時改變，故向英政府作上述兩項建議。今日發表之第二項文件，為美駐靑島領事一九三年一月卅日致國務院之電報，其中詳述日軍在靑島一帶之軍事行動。此外，今日發表者，尙有美駐平參事洛查特一九三八年二月十一日致國務院之報吿，說明日軍沿平漢路南下之情形，美駐滬總領事葛勒士致國務院之報吿，說明日軍佔領滬江大學之情形，同年三月卅一日美駐平海軍陸戰隊第四團亦曾報吿美當局，謂日本正規軍一師團，已有華中撤回日本，格魯致赫爾之電報，乃被竊後業已公布有關遠東問題之最重要文件，此電報中謂：克萊琪請廣田保證日本政府所宣布對中國無領土野心一語，係包括整個中國本士及其所屬各島嶼而言，廣田當時以憤怒之熊度，吿克萊琪稱：在目前作戰之狀態下，日本已盡可能，作一切合理之保證，廣田在此次與克萊琪談話時，未保證日本不佔海南易。格魯並吿赫爾稱：廣田對遠東之他國利益問題，日趨詞嚴色厲，而日本政府中極端愛國主義者之領導人，實非末次信正，而為廣田，克萊琪並獲悉日本在台灣集中大軍，並在高雄集中船隻，以此渠認為日本卽將進攻廣州其他華南港口，格魯對英大使克萊琪之幾乎每日向日本政府抗議日軍在華之軍事行動一節，當時頗表不滿。</p>
<h3>對任何援華建議　即時予同情考慮　美衆院外會新主席勃魯姆談話</h3>
<p>〔中央社華盛頓十一日電〕民主黨議員下任衆院外交委員會主席勃魯姆今談稱：渠之外委會，將對政府任何與全部援華建議，卽時予以同情之考慮。蔣夫人昨晚與社魯門會晤後，詳情保持秘密，因之外間人士對其使命成功興否，頗多揣測。勃氏卽係於此情形下發表此項聲明者。渠稱：美國之援助切勿過遲。勃氏主張對華應予以協助作戰外之一切援助。按勃氏於杜魯門意外當選之後，宣佈反對繼續援華，不久渠與杜魯門及國務院接觸之後，渠又謂擬追隨政府之政策。過去四日來，渠一再宣佈加張並擴大援華。若干人士認為渠或係反映政府之觀念，或從事試探行動。美國至少可按照目前之情形繼續援助，已無問題。大規模之軍事援助是否可與援希程度相同，是為一般人士注意之一。杜魯門最近對此不發表意見，馬歇爾認為一切均視國會之意見而定，故此種可能性，尙未由政府方面所抹殺。</p>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓十一日電〕美民主黨衆議員勃魯姆氏今日談稱：美國之援助中國應「不太少亦不應太遲。」勃氏在下屆國會中卽將担任「衆院外交委員會」主席，彼宣稱美國應立卽考慮中國問題，能使國民政府及時獲得美援來對抗共產黨。勃氏又稱：決定給予中國之任何援助應立卽趕運至中國。</p>

<p>第一階段—十一月六日至廿五日，黃口·徐州附近及碾莊戰鬥均屬之，此一階段參戰之匪軍，為陳毅全部，及劉伯承·陳賡各一部，結果斃傷匪約廿萬人，已將陳匪主力精銳擊破，我黃百韜兵團亦有重大損失；第二階段十一月廿六日以後，宿縣附近及淝河以北地區之戰鬥，匪軍為劉伯承·陳賡及陳毅全部殘餘兵力，截至十二月九日晨，已殲匪近十萬人，俘虜三千餘人，馬二百餘匹，步槍約五千枝，輕重機槍四百餘枝，衝鋒槍二百餘枝，各種砲四十餘門，已完成勝利途程十分之七八。</p>
<p>第二階段戰鬥經過</p>
<p>（一）匪軍於第一階段以陳毅全力，與我徐州方面各主力兵團戰鬥，以劉伯承·陳賡兩部，竄擾宿縣西北地區，切斷我後方交通，及阻止我北上增援部隊。爾後（十一月武六日起）以劉伯承·陳賡全力，於宿縣以南之南平集附近，猛撲我北上之黃維兵團，以陳毅殘餘主力南竄，陷我靈璧·固鎭，圖阻撲我李延年·劉汝明兩兵團於蚌埠以北之淝河沿岸地區。此時因我徐州各兵團，全力南下，匪乃復北向宿縣，永城間回竄，阻止我軍南北會師，企圖乘我主力分散，挾其囂張之勢，搖撼我後方民心，達成其渡淮過江之迷夢。此卽現在第二階段之戰鬥。統帥部及本部，對於匪情早已判明，故於第一階段會戰後，卽作第二階段會戰之實施，於十一月二十六日，以黃維兵團於雙堆集（宿縣南平集之南）附近，牽制膠着劉伯承陳賡兩匪部，以李延年劉汝明兩兵團，由任橋固鎭吸引陳毅匪部主力南下，至淝河北岸地區，而使徐州邱淸泉李彌孫元良三兵團，於十一月卅夜，由杜副總司令率領，全力南進，夾擊匪軍，本部亦於十一月廿八日，移駐蚌埠指揮，並督各方面兵團互相呼應配合，發揮最高戰鬥精神，以期一舉殲滅華中匪軍全部，一勞永逸，奠定江淮而為剿匪全面勝利之基礎。（二）連日來我黃維兵團，每日殲匪平均在二千人以上，匪軍不啻飛蛾撲火；我李延年兵團，於十二月一日穩定淝水防綫後，二日卽向匪反擊，六日收復新馬橋，現已進展至何集·火星廟以西五公里之綫，杜副總司令所率各兵團，於宿縣永城間地區，自三日至八日晚，已擊潰阻止我南下之匪五個縱隊，銳不可當，現我三方面部隊，均將當面匪軍實力擊破，且相距黃維兵團各僅三十公里，不日卽可會師。</p>
<p>匪我目前狀况</p>
<p>（一）匪軍陳毅主力精銳，於會戰第一階段中，損失甚重，現各縱隊兵員，其幹部已換至第三批，士兵每班僅存老兵三四人，以充班長組長，其餘均為民兵補充，及雜以我軍被俘之兵，戰力大减，「祗要將其官司長班長擊死，兵卽投誠」，劉伯承陳賡原來戰力甚差，現已傷亡重大，據俘匪供，數千里日夜轉戰，日不一飽，彈藥罄盡，「每兵不足彈藥二十發」，不打死餓死，餓不死打死，終歸一死，生者多不願再打，故匪不但無力繼續作戰，並且亦無氣再戰。（二）我軍雖有相當傷亡及相當損失，但僅為全力十之三四，大部戰力仍屬完整，且因匪軍之緊迫，已不復有往昔若干不健康之心理，深明覆巢之下，定無完卵，故均抱破釜沉舟之心，士氣俞愈戰愈高，且補給不斷，戰地自動投效及反正之兵員，日漸增多，戰力仍可維緊不墮。</p>
<p>結論</p>
<p>無可諱言，國軍因過去對日抗戰八年，養成防禦習慣，一時思想轉變不易，且裝備改進後，補給由後方運送數量增多，不免累贅行動形成遲鈍，難如匪之飄忽，致有若干不利之處，而一般社會上之鬆懈僥倖自保心理，亦多有傳染於部隊中者，經此次會戰後，已汰弱留强，無形中改正甚多，但軍事力量之基礎，乃寄託在政治經濟思想等之上，欲持續不墜，必須加强提高政治經濟思想上之效果不為功，更須全民有必勝之信念，軍隊有必死之決心，前後方同心一德，庶不為匪虛偽宣傳所動搖，得以完成剿匪救國之大業。觀於此次各慰勞團諸君，踴躍來到前方，不獨帶來京滬一帶人民自動捐輸之大量慰勞品，抑且帶來後方人民擁護剿匪之熱忱，而我前方部隊旺盛之士氣，安定之人心，亦可藉慰勞團諸君親眼所見，親耳所聞者，帶回後方，轉吿全民，於此足證我前後方軍民，已結為一體，剿匪前途，實為樂觀。預料此次於淝水之戰，必可永安江淮，而奠定戡亂建國大業之基礎也。</p>

<h3>社論　歡迎霍夫曼先生</h3>
<p>美經合總署署長霍夫曼先生，於十一日飛抵上海，他的特別助手李却士及助理國務卿潘利福之特別助理合巴爾，亦隨行同來。京滬中美首長，對於霍夫曼之來，寄予極熱忱之歡迎，蔣總統並特派美援運用委員會主委翁文灝來滬迎迓，將進而與之作懇切之商談。霍氏為美國主持對外援助之主腦人物，此次由美經歐來華，作實地之考察，無疑地為美國擴大援華之先聲。吾人除珍視霍氏此行任務之重大外，更以沉重而熱烈的心情，歡迎霍氏一行之蒞臨。</p>
<p>霍夫曼先生為當今美國著名的政治企業家，他與現政府的關係極為密切，且深獲杜魯門總統的信任。他出任現職之前，除任斯都貝克公司總經理外，復兼任芝加哥聯邦儲蓄銀行，大英百科全書，聯合航空公司，紐約保險公司，芝加哥公司等主任，所以他的事業和智慧，是多方面發展而獲有卓越成就的。一九四二年他出任美聯合援華會名譽主席，一九四八年四月五日被任為經合總署署長，專司馬歇雨計劃的執行。霍氏六年來努力從事援外復興工作，有計劃，有條理，已獲顯著的成就，國內外均著有盛大聲譽，尤其對華援助的關切與重視，久為我國朝野所感佩。以美國人民及政府對華傳統友誼來說，以霍夫曼先生多年來主持對華援助的卓越成就來說，霍氏實為我國人民及政府最良好而最親密之朋友。今天，好友遠道　然蒞止，所含意義之重大，當是萬分令人興奮而愉快的事。</p>
<p>美國年來的對華政策，似在搖擺不定之中。「馬歇爾計劃」的重歐輕亞，對於亞洲復興和亞洲安全的影響，已經足够沉重了。我國政府呼額美國，對我作更大的援助，不可謂不切，而美國迄今尙無明確的表示。美國的援華政策，似已陷入進退失據中。　蔣總統夫人宋美齡女士此次訪美，適霍氏離美飛歐，今番霍氏由「泠戰」的西歐飛臨「熱戰」的亞洲大陸，在政策上和認識上，將有一種新的體騐，進而從體騐中分析情况，釐定一種新的辦法，貢獻美國政府當軸。所以說霍氏此行，無論在美國或在我國，都是一種可喜的象徵。霍氏於十二月四日離美時會稱：「余之訪問中國，乃欲獲得惟由親自接觸所能得到之印象。駐華分著工作進行已有數月，余如能實地視察情形，則余對於在華所能完成之工作，將有更大之把握與更多之瞭解。」足徵現階段美國對華援助工作，要在謹愼中求實際的援助，要在體騐中決定援助的大小。至於援華的前提，我們深信其決沒有搖動而且需要加强的。</p>
<p>據聞霍氏此行，在華將逗留四五日，日內赴京晋謁　蔣總統，交換一般意見，擬定十五後取道朝鮮返美。霍氏視察西歐，工作重點在英德法，此來亞洲新大陸，工作重點側重中國朝鮮，這充分說明杜魯鬥總統已認識中韓局勢的危急，如無實際的有效的援助，中韓惡劣局勢的發展，當是萬分可憂的事。美國人民及政府對華的傳統友誼，極為深厚，今日中國遭受長期的破壞，和共產黨的叛亂，財政經濟更臻艱困，一切經濟復興工作均受阻撓與破壞，因此，為了中國民族的生存，及經濟復與工作的進行，中國人民及政府是竭誠希望美國加强援華的。</p>
<p>抑猶有須為霍民說明的；美國朋友年來本於良友忠吿之義，對我政府頗多批評。這一點，吾人固深為諒解，蓋惟其關切之深，乃不覺其實望之切。惟因此而不免中共黨惡意宜傳之毒計，以為中國人民或巳厭棄今日之國民政府甚至以為中國人民不再堅持反共；這却未免大謬。霍氏旣蒞中國經濟重心的上海市，吾人深盼其能有機會與中國工商企業界的領袖們相接觸，聽聽他們的意見，便可知道共黨宣傳之無稽。昨天上海市各界自救救國聯合會千餘會員的成立大會，討論會章時，全塲一致通過擁護元首，協助政府，餐促政治與社會之革新，發動人民力量，自救救國，便是中國人民在蔣總統堅定號召之下，與共黨絕不妥協的明證。美國果欲貫澈阻遏共產勢力的蔓延於全球，自當加强援助中國　蔣總統領鑲的國民政府。</p>
<p>霍夫曼先生身為馬歇爾計劃的執行人，又是重視現實體騐現實的政治家。今日中國需要美國更多更大的援助，想霍氏此行當有深切的認識，並且把這些新鮮的認識，從亞洲大陸帶回美洲大陸。今後美國對華援助的加强，當以霍氏美滿之行為嚆矢；這是我們可以預期的。</p>

<h3>動員戡亂時期　製發身份證辦法</h3>
<p>〔中央社南京十二日電〕各省市縣之身份證式樣，諸多不同，內容亦異，撿查人員每多眞偽莫辨，歹徒乘機偽造，混亂耳目，關於此事，茲據內政部人口局方面說明稱：各省市現時所發身份證，均係依據戶籍法施行細則所附式樣自行印製，紙張容或不同，但內容均經劃一規定，僅原式內「公職候選人」一欄，於卅六年元月改為「國民義務勞動」欄。又過去河南，江蘇，南京等省市所發身份證式，與戶籍法規定略異，現已改正辦理。該部並為在動員戡亂時期，加强身份證之效用與管制起見，業經制定動員戡亂時期製發國民身份證實施辦法，呈准公佈施行，茲誌全文如左：</p>

<h3>朝鮮問題進行最後辯論　蘇聯運用拖延戰略　第三屆聯大延遲一日閉幕</h3>
<p>〔聯合社巴黎十二日電〕聯合國大會今日午後二時四十五分再開全體會議，繼續討論韓國間題。</p>
<p>〔合衆社巴黎十二日電〕聯合國大會本定十一日晚閉幕。然蘇聯集團以長篇演說對付朝鮮問題，致聯大未能如期閉慕，十一日開會直至午夜二時，大會主席伊伐特巳精疲力盡，耳聆蘇聯集團重彈斥賣美國在南韓行動之老調，乃毅然宣佈休會·烏克蘭外長曼紐斯基首先演說五十五分鐘，中國代表蔣廷黻立卽演說八分鐘，以資答覆·白俄羅斯代表吉色列夫又上台發表冗長演說。政委會原已表決承認南韓政府為刺鮮之合法政府，並設置聯合國朝鮮永久委員會，由臨時委員會之國家運任，蘇聯則力表反對。曼紐斯基步上講壇，宣布渠擬「詳盡」討論朝鮮糾紛，繼力斥美國運用恐怖手段促成南韓大選，渠又稱，美國無權單方面主持朝鮮之選舉，而應由各大國主持。曼氏滔滔不絕演說時，各代表顯感不支，伊伐特素來諦聽各代表之演說，此次竟卸下耳機，頹坐椅中。紐西蘭總理弗萊寒酣然入睡。曼氏忿然抗議，弗氏身軀不動安睡如故。吉色列夫上台時，公共看合上巳僅留下一百四十五人，略資點綴。</p>
<p>〔中央社巴黎十二日電〕聯合國大會今晨未獲對韓國問題採取最後行動而定於今下午再行開會，以便在離開巴黎之前就韓國問題謀一解決。大會必須通過中美澳三國之聯合提案。該提案已在五十八國之政治委會中以絕大多數通過。其中（一）承認聯合國監督中選出之韓國政府為合法，（二）設立韓國委會以繼續現行臨時赴韓代表團之工作，其組成國家不變。（三）主張儘速撤退駐韓佔領軍。是項提案乃蘇聯集團國家所竭力反對者。中國代表蔣廷黻昨晚於午夜後登合發言，力主大會應於目前就韓國問題完成行動。渠稱，吾人之工作僅完成一半，如吾人於今晚作一適當決定，三千萬韓人將永遠銘感。斯拉夫國家代表團雖以冗長演詞拖延時刻，然觀察家似相信今日下午之會議，必能將韓國問題付諸表決。</p>
<h3>本屆聯大所獲成就</h3>
<p>〔聯合社巴黎十二日電〕本屆聯大接獲提案共七十五件，表決通過者不到六十件，其中且多屬次要問題。其電要決議案約舉如下：</p>
<p>（一）承認南韓政府。（二）設立巴勒斯坦調解委員會。（三）飭令聯大原子能委會仍為原子能國際共管事宜繼續工作，並令中美英蘇及加拿大等五國會同草擬原子能管制公約。（四）否決蘇聯主張四大國在一年內裁軍三分之一及禁用原子彈案，大會請軍備委員會繼續草擬軍備管制方案。（五）通過世界第一次人權宣言。（六）通過禁止集體殘殺公約。（七）譴責南保阿三國協助希臘游擊隊，此為大會對巴爾幹諸國最有力行動。（八）通過墨西哥請求四强直接談判及早解決柏林爭端案。大會主席卽澳外長伊伐特及聯大秘書長賴依曾根據此項決議致函四强領袖呼籲和平。</p>
<h3>開會歷八十二日　滔滔演說多憤激　各種件會務統計均打破紀錄</h3>
<p>〔合衆社巴黎十二日電〕本屆聯大會中前後發表之演說，長達一千萬言，然迄無一人能精密估計其中幾何為忿激之詞。聯合國秘書處宣稱，本屆巴黎聯大在各方面均打破紀錄，並發表下列統計數字，以資證明。發言之字數約一千萬，文件數十五萬份，文件總頁數一億，聯合國所負擔大會之總支出二百卅一萬五千元，會議日數八十二天，工作日數七十一天，全體會議五十次，去年僅四十九次。委員會及小組委員會之開會五百六十八次，去年為四百四十五次。會議時間總計一千八百小時，去年為一千二百小時。出席國家五十八國，代表總數二百七十五人，另替換代表一百卅八人。各代表團及秘書處之職員總數五千人，參觀人數約十一萬名。新聞記者及廣播記者數在一千七百人以上，計代表一千八百家報紙，通訊社，電台及期刋。譯員六十人，共工作一萬八千小時。</p>
<h3>聯大又一挿曲</h3>
<p>維辛斯基發言時　有人高呼「住口」</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社巴黎十一日電〕今日聯大舉行來次會議時，曾發生小事端。當蘇代表維辛斯基演說巴勒斯坦問題時，旁聽席中忽有一人路起大呼「住口」，卽由保安人員將該人押出會塲。</p>
<h3>禁集體屠殺公約　十八國簽字</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社巴黎十一日電〕禁止集體屠殺公約經聯大通過，今日已由十八國簽字。美法與南斯拉夫均在其列，其餘各國代表因尙未接本國政府訓令，故未簽字。按該公約規定對宗敎種族或國家團體作一部份或整個摧毀，乃違背國際公法之罪惡。</p>
<h3>南請求聯合國　拯救希政治犯</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社巴黎十一日電〕南斯拉夫代表團今夜致書聯合國秘書長賴依中請拯救因三年前參加希臘共黨運動而由希軍事法庭判處死刑之罪犯六百二十人。據稱，此輩今已被開始處決，故其餘諸犯決絕食以抗。書中溯述聯合國前曾千涉希工會會員十人之執行死刑而收效果。</p>
<h3>聯大各國代表　應法總統款宴</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社巴黎十一日電〕法總統歐體和今日在總統府宴待出席本屆聯大之各國代表，法總理居伊興其他內閣大員均列席作陪。席間聯大主席伊伐特代表各國對法國之招侍表示然烈感謝，渠稱，「法國雖有種種困難，然全國仍充滿自信和諧與平靜之空氣，將來之歷史一定會指出本屆聯大對世界和平之建立有極大之貢獻。法國偉大之精神已使聯合國更驅堅强。」歐禮和總統在答詞中，稱頌各國代表為偉大希望之寄託者，與高貴艱巨任務之工作者。當述及法國內問題時，總統稱，「我國正在力圖恢復中，我國之致命傷為資源之枯竭，無以應付復興之重任。」</p>

<h3>自救救國聯合會　昨舉行成立大會　本市軍政各首長應邀出席指導　擁護元首完成救國目的</h3>
<p>〔中央社訊〕上海各界自救救國聯合會，於昨日上午十時，在中正中路浦東同鄕會，舉行成立大會。計出席會員一千餘人。湯總司令恩伯，吳市畏國楨，陳警備司令大慶，及本市各局長，均被邀出席指導。主席幽經推由杜月笙·潘公展·徐寄廎·錢永銘·陳其采·章益·顏惠慶·王曉籟·劉鴻生·程中行·陶百川·周學湘·趙棣華·歐元懷·凌憲揚·秦潤鄉·楊虎等二十一人担任，並推杜月笙為總主席，主持開會典禮。大會於十時半揭幕，首由總王席杜月笙氏致詞，略稱：自政府戡亂軍事發展至徐蚌一帶後，戰綫與上海距離更趨接近，本市各界人士心理，也愈益緊張，在此緊張空氣下，雖有極少數人作逃避之想，但大多數人，無不考慮如何貢獻人民力量，保全吾人生活於斯工作於斯之上海，使永遠完整而繁榮。上海乃全國金融經濟重鎭，擁有五百萬以上人口，執全國交通總樞紐，幷爲世界一大都市，其地位，無論過去現在及將來，對中國及世界之重要性，均不言而喻，故愛護上海，保全上海，不但爲上海人責任，且爲全中國全世界人士之共同義務。吾人爲達成此一艱鉅重任，必須團結全上海各界人士人力物力，在國家元首領導下，展開救上海救國家之工作，吾人幷須以本市此一自救救國以至救世界之運動爲開始，諸全國同胞發揚光大，以爭取全世界愛好自由和平人士之同情與援助。本會發起組織之動機卽在此，其組織辦法及工作綱領，均已詳細擬定，今日本會成立，參加人士，空前踴躍，幷得本市軍政機關首長出席指導，發起同人，無限感奮。從歷史上看，上海雖歷遭大刧，終因吾人勇於自救，而使上海巍然無恙，希望此次自教救國運動，亦能秉承吾人旣往光榮，大家鼓起勇氣，擁護元首，迅速達成救國救世之目的，使上海永爲正義堡壘，文明燈塔，屹立遠東。</p>
<p>羣策羣力自求多福　集中貢獻人力物力　協助政府革新政治</p>
<p>繼由籌備委負會代表潘議長報吿發起及籌備經過，渠稱：自國軍因戰略關係，自東北長潘撤退，濟南又吿失守，徐蚌大會戰開始以來，京滬人心不安，社會浮動，政府少數官員，地方若干豪富，甚至紛紛携眷他往，逃避現實，幸而吾最高當局，始終堅定，戡亂國策，屹立不搖，前綫將士浴血殺賊，保衛疆土，後方人心漸吿安定。上海各社會團體關切國事的人士，先後交換意見的結果，咸以爲在目前危急的局勢情形之下，堅定人心，自救救國，爲唯一協助政府救國之道，乃有本會之成立。有許多人都在問前方戰事如何？夫援又如何？却沒有人問自己如何？此乃絕大錯誤，假使外國人問你中國人自己怎樣作，假使前方將士問後方同胞怎樣貢獻於國家，我們將何辭以對？上海是國際都市，一切動作都能起領導作用的，我們認爲要保護上海，必須集中上海市民全部的力量，把這整個力量貢獻給國家，國家得了救，也就救了上海，救了我們自己。潘氏謂共匪的殘酷與非人道的作風，可以從匪區逃難來滬的同胞口中證實之，共匪所施用之人海戰術，就是將匪區中的同胞自十八歲至四十五歲，全部分批强迫驅往作戰的最前綫，充作第一綫的砲灰。上海有若干人士計劃離開上海，這辦法是一條死路，自己的生命財產必須拿自已的力量來保護，才能獲救。本會經發起人多次會議，將近一月的籌備，擬就組織大綱草案，提供大會討論，其會員份子將包含所有上海各法團及其有志救國的理監事，以及一切自願入會之志士，相與共同努力，蓋本會成立的目的，乃在擁護元首，協助政府，堅定信心的目標下，努力工作，希望做到：（一）集中貢獻八力與物力於國家和地方，（二）協助政府革新政治，以人民的力量促政府勵精圖治，與民吏始，並堅定我們的外交政策，使反侵略的陣容格外明朗，政局煥然一新，然後可獲國際盟邦之重視，而加强對我之援助，古語云。「自求多福」，今天上海市民必須羣策羣力，在五百萬市民怒吼聲中，擁護元首，消滅共匪，乃爲吾人自救救國的責任。</p>
<p>大家從遠處着想才能救國救上海</p>
<p>次由湯總司令恩伯，吳市長國楨，陳司令大慶分別致訓詞。湯總司令稱：（一）救國就是自救，希望大家從遠處着想，大處着想，才能救國，救上海。（二）上海市塲關係國家，關係國際，請大家集中力量，發揮力量，挽救當前危局，更望自救救國聯合會，維持上海秩序，維持上海治安，協助政府，展開救國工作。（三）我們應該加强信心，擁護政府，才能自救救國。在目前，政府固有缺點，地方亦不無缺點，致造成如此艱苦局面。故政治必須革新，地方亦應革新，而且，必須全面革新，造成新風氣，產生新力量，才能救國家救上海。</p>
<p>黃百韜將軍成仁張翰庭船主義勇　前方將士後方民衆都應效法自救國</p>
<p>吳市長稱：「今天本市各界自救救國聯合會，舉行成立大會，承邀參加大會，十分興奮，此次上海各界組「自救救國」的團體，本人深感此次江亞輪失事，船主張翰庭，能見義勇爲，拯救了五百餘遇難乘客，這種俠義精神，實足以風世。我們個個人都像義勇船主，就能自救了。憶自徐蚌會戰發生後，黃百韜將軍以五萬兵員殲滅共軍十萬，以寡敵衆，最後以目的已達，爲表示與將士共存亡起見，殺身成仁，以報國家，此種視死如歸之精神，堪爲吾國模範軍官，前方將士個個能像黃將軍，我們國家就能得救了，希望前方將士，後方民衆，應該向殺身成仁的黃將軍，與義勇救人的張翰庭先生看齊，共同自救救國。次之，我們要保衛上海，必須先安定上海，安定上海，必先安定民心，鎭定應付。共產黨慣使謠言技倆，如此次內子生病達四個月之久，現尙在醫治中，共匪造謠我的眷屬已遷，對我個人影響甚小，動搖民心則甚大，希望大家各安其業，勿輕信謠諑，集中力量，自救救國，完成使命。</p>

<h3>The Key to Victory in the Bengbu-Suzhou Campaign Lies in the Confluence of Li and Huang's Corps; Current Distance is Only Thirty Li</h3>
<p>[Our Bengbu Dispatch, 12th] It is undeniable that the National Army is currently facing a critical juncture in the Bengbu-Suzhou battlefield, namely the confluence of Li and Huang's two corps. Once this key is unlocked, the problems facing the southward-advancing corps are likely to be readily resolved. Although the Li Yannian Corps on the southern front is facing increased resistance from the enemy's reinforcements, with defenses set up in every village, and with the recent weather being unfavorable for air force activity, it seems that a trend towards positional warfare has formed. However, this does not mean that the confluence of Li and Huang will face any difficulties; its impact will only mean that the time for the confluence will not be as fast as generally expected. Considering the development trend of the war situation, the National Army on the southern front is currently in a favorable position to complete the encirclement and annihilation of the stubborn bandits facing them. The Huang Wei Corps continues to advance southeast, forcefully pressuring the bandits on the north bank of the Xie River to fall into the encirclement set up by the National Army. This corps is currently advancing with a steady and solid, step-by-step offensive, making every place its troops arrive a strong position. This is because the corps has formed an extremely stable base with the three major strongholds of Shuangduiji, Dayingji, and Luoji, and cannot easily abandon them. Therefore, yesterday, the bandits opened a gap near Dayingji, a stronghold on the southeastern side of the corps, attempting to lure the Huang Corps out and intercept it. However, the Huang Corps saw through their trick and was not deceived. Instead, it used counter-encirclement tactics to defeat more than one of the enemy's divisions. As of yesterday, the distance between the Huang and Li corps was about forty-five li. With the full advance of the two corps, the date of their confluence is not far off. The confluence of the Huang and Li corps will also be the turning point for the National Army to gain an advantage in this battlefield. As for the Qiu, Li, and Sun corps on the northern front, after inflicting heavy blows on the enemy, the originally cut-off positions have now been integrated into one. The enemy's attack is aimed only at preventing the National Army from rapidly advancing southward. With the current infantry and artillery strength of Chen Yi's troops, they are by no means capable of encircling and attacking this powerful corps. From this, we can clearly understand that the Communist bandits have always been known for their "one point, two sides" tactics, but in today's Bengbu-Suzhou campaign, they have completely ignored this point, forming a "three points, one side" situation, causing them to be concerned about everything in front of the three major battlefields and losing the initiative. Therefore, once Li and Huang join forces, the bandits facing the southward-advancing corps will naturally collapse without being attacked, and the exhausted and crippled troops will most likely be unable to escape the pincer attack of the National Army.</p>
<p>[Our Bengbu Dispatch, 12th] The southern front of the Bengbu-Suzhou battlefield is still progressing steadily. Currently, in the fifty-li battlefield, the war actions formed by both sides are no longer simply pursuit and obstruction. On the enemy side, they are currently using the countless villages in this area, setting up defenses everywhere, trying to use the "dispersed deployment" tactic to avoid air force bombing and artillery fire on the one hand, and to obstruct the National Army's attack and delay the time for the confluence of the Li and Huang corps on the other hand. As for the National Army, according to preliminary information obtained this afternoon, the pincers-shaped offensive of the Li Yannian Corps has gradually changed to an arc shape. In addition to launching attacks on Xiaoji (between Xinji and Baojiaji, the mutual distance is ten li) and Baojiaji in front of this arc-shaped front line, its left flank has been extended to the south side of Renheji, and it is now also launching a fierce attack on this stronghold. This nearly thirty-li arc-shaped front line was originally facing northwest, but the current arc opening has turned to the west-north direction. This strategic trend of the National Army will likely focus on the left flank, allowing it to continue to detour northward, in order to form an encirclement and annihilation of the stubbornly resisting bandits facing it. On the Huang Wei Corps side, yesterday, it continued to focus on Dayingji (on the north bank of the Xie River) and advanced southeast, hoping to force the remnant bandits to the south bank of the Xie River and join forces with the Li Corps to encircle and suppress them. The corps' position has been extended to the Wangzhuang and Zhuzhuang line (about five or six li east-southeast of Dayingji), and it has defeated more than one enemy regiment.</p>
<p>[Our Bengbu Dispatch, 12th] Reliable sources: Taking advantage of the Huang Wei Corps' movement southeast, Liu's bandits concentrated their forces from yesterday onwards to fiercely attack south of Shuangduiji, attempting to cut the corps' position into two sections. According to the Commander-in-Chief's Office communique tonight, after a day and night of fierce fighting, the offensive slightly subsided this morning. At noon, the bandits increased reinforcements and attacked, and fierce fighting is currently underway.</p>
<p>[Our Bengbu Dispatch, 12th] The Commander-in-Chief's Office announced: The right wing of the Li Corps is progressing rapidly. Today, it successively captured Xinji, Guantangmiao, and Waji. According to reports, Waji is about eight li west of Xinji, and the distance between the positions of the Li and Huang corps is now only thirty li.</p>
<h3>The National Army in Eastern Hebei Takes the Initiative to Make New Deployments; Bandits Attacking Fangshan are Repelled; The National Army Outside Zhangjiakou Expands its Victory and Captures Yongfeng Fort</h3>
<p>[Our Beiping Dispatch, 12th] The remnant Communist Nie Rongzhen's 7th Column has been pressing towards Fangshan County (southeast of Beiping) from Zhangfang, west of Fangshan and along the Juma River, for days. There was fierce fighting in the suburbs of Fangshan City last night, but they have been repelled by this morning. Today, the Ping-Bao line is open to Liangxiang, and the Ping-Gu line is open to Tongxian, but there are no passenger trains. Many passenger and freight trains between Beiping and Tianjin are suspended or delayed.</p>
<p>[Our Tianjin Dispatch, 12th] The situation in eastern Hebei has changed rapidly. The National Army has taken the initiative to make new deployments. Guye was occupied by bandits at 1:30 PM on the 12th. It is reported that the Kailuan East Three Mines are safe. Communication between Tangshan and Tianjin was cut off at 2:30 PM this afternoon. The details are unknown. Trains to eastern Tianjin are all stopping at Tangshan. One train heading west arrived in Tianjin, carrying a full load of Catholic personnel. Refugees on foot along the way are also endless.</p>
<p>[Our Tongxian Dispatch, 12th] According to an official source, the main force of Lin's 7th Column, numbering over ten thousand, left Yutian northward on the 11th. The stretcher teams recruited by the bandits in the area were unattended and have been automatically disbanded.</p>
<p>[Our Beiping Dispatch, 12th] The battle situation in the eastern section of the Ping-Sui Railway is gradually becoming quiet. After the Communist bandits near Xinbaoan were fiercely attacked by the National Army's powerful forces, they fled in defeat to the northeastern mountainous area and have not dared to act recklessly in the past two days. Taking advantage of the victory, the Zhangjiakou National Army expanded its gains. From yesterday afternoon to this morning, it launched attacks on the remnant bandits near Laohushan in the southeast of Zhangjiakou and Wulaha Pass in the northwest of Zhangjiakou. The morale of the National Army is high, and it is continuing to mop up the area. The Ping-Sui trains were open to Nankou the day before yesterday and yesterday, but passenger and freight trains are suspended today. Military trains passed through Shahe this morning.</p>
<p>[Our Zhangjiakou Dispatch, 12th] The outer perimeter of Zhangjiakou was calm all day on the 12th.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Zhangjiakou, 11th] The National Army outside Zhangjiakou continued to pursue and suppress the remnant bandits. The National Army moving north recovered Yongfeng Fort on the 11th.</p>
<h3>Gao and Bao in Northern Jiangsu are Peaceful</h3>
<p>Only the Zhenjiang-Yangzhou Shipping Line is Operating to Shaobo</p>
<p>[Our Zhenjiang Dispatch, 12th] Gaoyou and Baoying are as peaceful as usual. Telecommunications between here and Gao-Bao are unobstructed, but they were interrupted once at 2:00 PM yesterday. They have been restored today. At the same time, telecommunications between Yangzhou and Taizhou were also restored today. As for the people along the way moving south in droves, it is really unnecessary panic. Due to the crowding of passengers in Gaoyou, the Zhenjiang-Yangzhou liner only went as far as Shaobo today.</p>
<h3>Jinan Breakthrough Generals; Cao Zhenduo and Others Arrive in Jiangxi</h3>
<p>[Our Nanchang Dispatch, 12th] The generals who broke through from Jinan and escaped currently include Cao Zhenduo, commander of the 73rd Division; Tian Yusheng, chief of staff of the 2nd Restructuring Division; a certain Cui, deputy commander of the 213th Brigade; and Che Si, deputy commander of the 77th Brigade.

<h3>Hoffman and Members of the American Aid Committee Hold Informal Talks; Weng Wenhao Urges Hoffman to Consider Temporary Aid to China Measures; President Sun Hosts a Dinner Party for Hoffman Last Night</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] After the Director of the US Economic Cooperation Administration, Hoffman, arrived in Shanghai a few days ago, he held the first informal meeting with the members of the Executive Yuan's American Aid Utilization Committee at the ECA branch office here starting at 4:30 PM yesterday. Weng Wenhao, chairman of the American Aid Committee, Vice Chairman Yu Hongjun, members Yan Jiagan, Shen Xirui, and Mayor Wu, as well as Mr. Lapham and Mr. Griffin, attended the meeting, which lasted about an hour. The atmosphere was exceptionally harmonious.</p>
<p>During the meeting, Chairman Weng made a request to Mr. Hoffman. Mr. Weng stated that if the US Congress delays passing the new aid-to-China plan for the next year, Mr. Hoffman should consider temporary arrangements for aid to China. The existing economic aid to China funds, totaling 275 million US dollars, must all be spent or designated for specific uses before April 3rd of next year.</p>
<p>Mr. Hoffman told Mr. Weng that he has been closely connected with the actual situation in China with the help of Mr. Lapham. Mr. Hoffman particularly emphasized that the United States has always paid attention to "helping free people who are willing to obtain freedom" in the past and will continue to pay attention to it in the future.</p>
<p>Mr. Hoffman also held meetings with US Ambassador to China Stuart and US Consul General to Shanghai Cabot yesterday morning. Mr. Stuart and Mr. Cabot provided Mr. Hoffman with opinions on the current situation in China. After the meeting, Mr. Hoffman summoned representatives of various American volunteer charitable relief organizations in China to hear reports on their work in China.

<h3>Guo Zongfen Analyzes the Overall Situation in the North; If We Can Ensure Beiping and Tianjin, There is Indeed Potential in North China; Whoever Can Seize the High Ground Can Manipulate Victory</h3>
<p>[Our Beiping Dispatch, 12th] Guo Zongfen, deputy commander-in-chief of the North China Suppression Headquarters, told reporters that Beiping is a cultural city in the north, Tianjin is an industrial center in North China, and Taiyuan is a military industrial base in the north. As long as these two points are ensured, there is still potential in North China. From Tianjin, through Beiping, Zhangjiakou, to Datong, is a large wall in the north. Although this wall has partially collapsed and is no longer complete, it still has its function. The Communist bandits are currently doing their best to push down this wall, and a decisive battle between the two sides is almost inevitable. From the perspective of the National Army, the closer this decisive battle area is, the more advantageous it is. The Guankou on the Great Wall line is an "隘道戰" area. Whoever can seize the high ground can manipulate victory. This time, the National Army occupied the high ground in Guankou, so the Communist bandits avoided fighting in Guankou and shifted their forces south. Speaking of the Taiyuan battle, Mr. Guo said: After the fierce battle in the northwest suburbs a few days ago, the battle situation in Taiyuan has become quiet. Air force planes frequently fly over the area every day for reconnaissance and bombing. Chennault's air transport team has increased three shifts of aircraft starting on the 12th to strengthen its forces. Mr. Guo finally said that if 10,000 more troops could be added, the situation in Taiyuan would have the possibility of unfolding.</p>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] Weng Wenhao, chairman of the Executive Yuan's American Aid Utilization Committee, in order to prepare to provide the Director of the US Economic Cooperation Administration, Hoffman, with the necessary information, convened a meeting of the committee's members staying in Shanghai at the Central Bank conference room yesterday morning. Vice Chairman Yu Hongjun, members Yan Jiagan, Shen Xirui, Mayor Wu, and others attended the meeting, which lasted until nearly noon before dispersing.</p>
<h3>President Sun Discharged from the Hospital; The Date of Return to Beijing is Not Yet Determined</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] President Sun Ke, who had been staying in Shanghai for several days to have a leg tumor removed, was permitted by the doctor yesterday and was discharged from the hospital at around 9:00 AM, accompanied by his wife and eldest son, to rest at the official residence on Columbia Road. According to President Sun's aides, the date of President Sun's return to Beijing is not yet determined. Dr. Lin Dawei, who performed the surgery for President Sun, told reporters that the wound left by President Sun's tumor removal was quite large. Although new muscle has now joined together, there is still hidden pain when walking, so he has instructed President Sun to rest as much as possible in the next few days and not engage in activities like ordinary people.</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 10th] The US House Committee Investigating Actions Against American Interests released secret documents on the 10th concerning the movements of Japanese troops in China in 1938 and setting forth the British-Japanese relationship at that time. According to these documents, it was rumored that they were stolen from the State Department ten years ago and obtained by Soviet spies. In the "most confidential telegram" sent by US Ambassador to Japan Grew to Secretary of State Hull on February 13, 1938, it was stated that the British Ambassador to Japan made the following recommendations to the British government: (1) Continuing to aid China with war materials, money, or any other means would be detrimental to British interests. (2) The British government should always pay attention to promoting peace talks, which may allow China to have hope of revival. The House released a total of twelve documents today, including Grew's telegram. According to reports, these documents were all stolen from the State Department, namely by Chambers, who confessed to passing information for the Communist Party. According to the House Committee Investigating Actions Against American Interests, a total of 200 documents were found from Chambers. The above-mentioned twelve documents are only a part of them. Grew's telegram stated that in a certain meeting between British Ambassador Craigie and Japanese Foreign Minister Hirota, Hirota twice became furious due to the British side's protest against Japan's occupation of some small islands near Hong Kong. According to Grew, Craigie was deeply concerned that Japan's guarantee of no territorial ambitions in China could change at any time, so he made the above two recommendations to the British government. The second document released today was a telegram sent by the US Consul in Qingdao to the State Department on January 30, 1938, which detailed the military actions of the Japanese army in the Qingdao area. In addition, those released today also included a report sent by US Counselor to Beiping Lockhart to the State Department on February 11, 1938, explaining the situation of the Japanese army moving south along the Ping-Han Railway, a report sent by US Consul General to Shanghai Gauss to the State Department, explaining the situation of the Japanese army occupying Shanghai University, and on March 31 of the same year, the US Marine Corps Fourth Regiment in Beiping also reported to the US authorities that a division of the Japanese regular army had been withdrawn from Central China to Japan. Grew's telegram to Hull is the most important document related to the Far East problem that has been stolen and published. This telegram stated that Craigie asked Hirota to guarantee that the Japanese government's announcement of no territorial ambitions in China included the entire Chinese mainland and its affiliated islands. Hirota told Craigie at that time with an angry attitude that, in the current state of war, Japan had done everything possible to make all reasonable guarantees. Hirota did not guarantee that Japan would not occupy Hainan Island during this conversation with Craigie. Grew also told Hull that Hirota was becoming increasingly severe in his words and tone regarding the interests of other countries in the Far East, and that the leader of the extremely patriotic elements in the Japanese government was not Sumitsuke Nobumasa, but Hirota. Craigie also learned that Japan had concentrated a large army in Taiwan and concentrated ships in Kaohsiung, so he believed that Japan was about to attack Guangzhou and other South China ports. Grew expressed considerable dissatisfaction at the time with British Ambassador Craigie's almost daily protest to the Japanese government against the military actions of the Japanese army in China.</p>
<h3>Immediate Sympathetic Consideration for Any Aid-to-China Suggestions; A Conversation with Bloom, the New Chairman of the US House Foreign Affairs Committee</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 11th] Democratic Congressman Bloom, the incoming chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, said today that his committee will give immediate sympathetic consideration to any and all aid-to-China suggestions from the government. After Madame Chiang met with Truman last night, the details were kept secret, so outsiders speculated a lot about the success or failure of her mission. Mr. Bloom issued this statement under these circumstances. He said that American aid must not be too late. Mr. Bloom advocated providing China with all aid except for assistance in combat. According to reports, after Truman's unexpected election, he announced his opposition to continuing aid to China. Soon after he contacted Truman and the State Department, he said that he intended to follow the government's policy. For the past four days, he has repeatedly declared that he would strengthen and expand aid to China. Some people believe that he may be reflecting the government's views or engaging in exploratory actions. There is no question that the United States can continue to provide aid at least in its current form. Whether large-scale military aid can be on par with the level of aid to Greece is what the general public is paying attention to. Truman recently declined to express an opinion on this. Marshall believes that everything depends on the opinion of Congress, so this possibility has not been erased by the government.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 11th] US Democratic Congressman Bloom said today that American aid to China should be "not too little and not too late." Mr. Bloom will serve as chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee in the next Congress. He declared that the United States should immediately consider the China issue so that the National Government can receive US aid in time to resist the Communist Party. Mr. Bloom also said that any aid given to China should be shipped to China immediately.</p>
<h3>The Huaihai Campaign: Summary of the Second Stage of Military Operations; Report by Zhang Yujin, Spokesperson for the Xuzhou Pacification Headquarters: The Battle of Feishui Will Surely Secure the Yangtze and Huai Rivers Forever</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Bengbu, 12th] Major General Zhang Yujin, spokesperson for the Pacification Headquarters here, recently released a military report on the second stage of the Huaihai Campaign, summarized as follows:</p>
<p>Dates of the Campaign</p>
<p>First Stage – November 6th to 25th, including the battles near Huang Kou, Xuzhou, and Nianzhuang. The communist forces participating in this stage were the entire force of Chen Yi and parts of Liu Bocheng and Chen Geng's forces. The result was approximately 200,000 communists killed or wounded, and Chen Yi's main elite forces were defeated. Our Huang Baitao Corps also suffered significant losses. Second Stage: November 26th onwards, battles in the vicinity of Su County and north of the Fei River area. The communist forces are the remnants of Liu Bocheng, Chen Geng, and the entire Chen Yi force. As of the morning of December 9th, nearly 100,000 communists have been annihilated, with over 3,000 captured prisoners, over 200 horses, approximately 5,000 rifles, over 400 light and heavy machine guns, over 200 submachine guns, and over 40 artillery pieces of various types. We have completed seven or eight tenths of the path to victory.</p>
<p>Course of the Second Stage of Battle</p>
<p>(1) In the first stage, the communist army used Chen Yi's full force to fight our main corps around Xuzhou, while Liu Bocheng and Chen Geng's units harassed the northwest area of Su County, cutting off our rear communications and preventing our reinforcements from moving north. Afterwards (starting from November 26th), Liu Bocheng and Chen Geng used their full force to fiercely attack our Huang Wei Corps moving north near Nanpingji, south of Su County. Chen Yi's remaining main force fled south, capturing Lingbi and Guzhen, attempting to block our Li Yannian and Liu Ruming Corps along the Fei River north of Bengbu. At this time, because our Xuzhou corps moved south with all their strength, the communists turned north again, fleeing back and forth between Su County and Yongcheng, to prevent our army from converging from the north and south, attempting to take advantage of our main force being dispersed and shake the morale of our rear areas with their arrogance, in order to achieve their dream of crossing the Huai River and the Yangtze River. This is the current second stage of the battle. The General Headquarters and this headquarters had already judged the communist situation, so after the first stage of the campaign, the second stage of the campaign was implemented. On November 26th, the Huang Wei Corps was used in Shuangduiji (south of Nanpingji in Su County) to contain and engage the two communist forces of Liu Bocheng and Chen Geng, while the two corps of Li Yannian and Liu Ruming attracted the main force of Chen Yi's communists south from Renqiao and Guzhen to the north bank of the Fei River. The three corps of Qiu Qingquan, Li Mi, and Sun Yuanliang of Xuzhou were led by Deputy Commander-in-Chief Du on the night of November 30th, advancing south with all their strength to attack the communist army. This headquarters also moved to Bengbu on November 28th to direct and supervise the mutual support and cooperation of the various corps, in order to exert the highest fighting spirit, in order to annihilate all the communist forces in Central China in one fell swoop, once and for all, laying the foundation for securing the Yangtze and Huai Rivers and achieving overall victory in the suppression of bandits. (2) In recent days, our Huang Wei Corps has annihilated an average of more than 2,000 communists every day, and the communist army is like moths flying into a flame. After stabilizing the Fei River defense line on December 1st, our Li Yannian Corps counterattacked the communists on the 2nd, and recovered Xinmaqiao on the 6th. It has now advanced to a line five kilometers west of Heji and Huoxingmiao. The corps led by Deputy Commander-in-Chief Du, in the area between Su County and Yongcheng, has defeated five communist columns that were blocking our southward advance from the 3rd to the evening of the 8th. They are unstoppable. Currently, our three-pronged forces have broken through the strength of the communist army facing them, and they are only 30 kilometers away from the Huang Wei Corps. They will be able to converge in the near future.</p>
<p>Current Situation of the Communists and Us</p>
<p>(1) The main elite force of the communist army, Chen Yi, suffered heavy losses in the first stage of the campaign. Currently, the personnel of each column have had their cadres replaced to the third batch, and only three or four veterans remain in each squad as squad leaders and team leaders. The rest are supplemented by militia and mixed with our captured soldiers, and their combat strength has been greatly reduced. "As long as you kill their company commander and squad leader, the soldiers will surrender." Liu Bocheng and Chen Geng originally had very poor combat strength, and now they have suffered heavy casualties. According to the captured communists, they have been fighting day and night for thousands of miles, and they are not full for a single day. Their ammunition is exhausted. "Each soldier has less than 20 rounds of ammunition." They will die whether they are killed in battle or starve to death. Those who do not starve to death will be killed in battle. Either way, they will die in the end. Most of those who survive are unwilling to fight again. Therefore, the communists not only have no ability to continue fighting, but also have no will to fight again. (2) Although our army has suffered considerable casualties and losses, it is only three or four tenths of our full strength, and most of our combat strength is still intact. Moreover, due to the urgency of the communist army, we no longer have some of the unhealthy psychology of the past. We understand that when the nest is overturned, there will be no intact eggs. Therefore, we all hold the determination to break the cauldrons and sink the boats. The morale is higher and higher, and the supply is constant. The number of soldiers who automatically join our side and defect on the battlefield is gradually increasing, and our combat strength can still be maintained without declining.</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>It is undeniable that the National Army developed a habit of defense during the past eight years of the war against Japan, and it is not easy to change its thinking for a while. Moreover, after the equipment was improved, the number of supplies transported from the rear increased, which inevitably burdened the movement and made it slow, making it difficult to be as elusive as the communists, resulting in some disadvantages. The general society's loose, opportunistic, and self-preserving psychology has also been transmitted to the troops. After this campaign, the weak have been eliminated and the strong have been retained, and many things have been corrected invisibly. However, the foundation of military strength is entrusted to politics, economy, and ideology. If we want to continue without declining, we must strengthen and improve the effects of politics, economy, and ideology. We must also have a national belief in victory and the army must have the determination to die. The front and the rear must be of one heart and one mind, so as not to be shaken by the communists' false propaganda, so as to complete the great cause of suppressing bandits and saving the country. Judging from the fact that all the members of the comfort groups have enthusiastically come to the front, not only bringing a large number of comfort goods automatically donated by the people in the Beijing and Shanghai areas, but also bringing the enthusiasm of the people in the rear for supporting the suppression of bandits, and the strong morale and stable morale of our front-line troops can also be brought back to the rear by the members of the comfort groups who have seen and heard with their own eyes, and tell the whole people. This is enough to prove that our front and rear soldiers and civilians have become one, and the future of suppressing bandits is indeed optimistic. It is expected that the Battle of Feishui will surely secure the Yangtze and Huai Rivers forever, and lay the foundation for the great cause of suppressing the rebellion and building the country.</p>

<h3>Editorial: Welcoming Mr. Hoffman</h3>
<p>Mr. Hoffman, Director of the U.S. Economic Cooperation Administration, arrived in Shanghai by plane on the 11th, accompanied by his special assistant, Mr. Lee Que-Shi, and Mr. Hebar, special assistant to Assistant Secretary of State Pan Libu. The Chinese and American leaders in Beijing and Shanghai have expressed a warm welcome to Mr. Hoffman's arrival. President Chiang Kai-shek has specially appointed Mr. Weng Wenhao, chairman of the U.S. Aid Utilization Committee, to come to Shanghai to greet him and will have a sincere discussion with him. Mr. Hoffman is the main figure in charge of foreign aid in the United States. This time, he came to China from Europe to conduct on-the-spot inspections, which is undoubtedly a prelude to the United States' expansion of aid to China. In addition to cherishing the importance of Mr. Hoffman's mission, we also welcome the arrival of Mr. Hoffman and his party with a heavy and enthusiastic mood.</p>
<p>Mr. Hoffman is a well-known political entrepreneur in the United States today. He has a very close relationship with the current government and is deeply trusted by President Truman. Before taking office, he served as the general manager of Studebaker Corporation, as well as the director of the Chicago Federal Reserve Bank, Encyclopedia Britannica, United Airlines, New York Insurance Company, Chicago Company, etc. Therefore, his career and wisdom have been developed in many ways and have achieved remarkable achievements. In 1942, he served as honorary chairman of the U.S. United Aid to China Association. On April 5, 1948, he was appointed as the Director of the Economic Cooperation Administration, specializing in the implementation of the Marshall Plan. In the past six years, Mr. Hoffman has worked hard to engage in foreign aid and reconstruction, with planning and order, and has achieved remarkable achievements. He has a great reputation at home and abroad, especially his concern and emphasis on aid to China, which has long been admired by the Chinese government and the public. In terms of the traditional friendship between the American people and the government towards China, and in terms of Mr. Hoffman's outstanding achievements in hosting aid to China over the years, Mr. Hoffman is indeed the best and closest friend of the Chinese people and the government. Today, it is a very exciting and pleasant thing that a good friend has come from afar, and the significance it contains is extremely important.</p>
<p>In recent years, the United States' policy towards China seems to be wavering. The emphasis on Europe and the neglect of Asia in the "Marshall Plan" has had a sufficiently heavy impact on the reconstruction and security of Asia. It cannot be said that the Chinese government's call for the United States to provide greater assistance to China is not appropriate, but the United States has not yet made a clear statement. The United States' aid to China policy seems to have fallen into a dilemma. Mrs. Chiang Kai-shek, Soong Mei-ling's visit to the United States coincided with Mr. Hoffman's departure from the United States to Europe. This time, Mr. Hoffman flew from the "cold war" Western Europe to the "hot war" Asian continent, and will have a new experience in policy and understanding, and then analyze the situation from the experience and formulate a new method to contribute to the United States government authorities. Therefore, Mr. Hoffman's trip is a welcome symbol in both the United States and China. Mr. Hoffman said when he left the United States on December 4: "My visit to China is to obtain impressions that can only be obtained through personal contact. The work of the resident Chinese branch has been underway for several months. If I can inspect the situation on the spot, I will have greater confidence and more understanding of the work that can be accomplished in China." This shows that the current stage of the United States' aid to China work is to seek practical assistance in prudence and to determine the size of assistance in experience. As for the premise of aid to China, we firmly believe that it has not wavered and needs to be strengthened.</p>
<p>It is reported that Mr. Hoffman will stay in China for four or five days, and will go to Beijing to meet President Chiang Kai-shek to exchange general opinions and plan to return to the United States via Korea after the 15th. Mr. Hoffman's inspection of Western Europe focused on the United Kingdom, Germany, and France. This time, his work in the new continent of Asia focused on China and Korea. This fully shows that President Truman has recognized the urgency of the situation in China and Korea. Without practical and effective assistance, the development of the deteriorating situation in China and Korea is a matter of great concern. The traditional friendship between the American people and the government towards China is very deep. Today, China has suffered long-term destruction and communist rebellion, and its finances and economy have become even more difficult. All economic reconstruction work has been hindered and destroyed. Therefore, for the survival of the Chinese nation and the progress of economic reconstruction, the Chinese people and the government sincerely hope that the United States will strengthen its aid to China.</p>
<p>It is still necessary to explain to the people of Hoffman. In recent years, American friends have often criticized our government based on the loyalty of good friends. We deeply understand this, because the deeper the concern, the deeper the disappointment. However, because of this, the evil propaganda of the Chinese Communist Party is inevitable, thinking that the Chinese people may have abandoned today's National Government, or even that the Chinese people no longer insist on anti-communism; this is a big mistake. Mr. Hoffman has come to Shanghai, the economic center of China. We sincerely hope that he can have the opportunity to contact the leaders of the Chinese industrial and commercial circles and listen to their opinions, so that he can know the absurdity of the Communist Party's propaganda. Yesterday, at the founding meeting of more than 1,000 members of the Shanghai Self-Salvation and National Salvation Joint Association, when discussing the constitution, the whole group unanimously passed the resolution to support the head of state, assist the government, promote political and social innovation, and mobilize the people's strength to save themselves and save the country. This is the clear proof that the Chinese people will never compromise with the Communist Party under the firm call of President Chiang Kai-shek. If the United States wants to implement the spread of communist forces throughout the world, it should strengthen its aid to the National Government led by President Chiang Kai-shek.</p>
<p>Mr. Hoffman is the executor of the Marshall Plan and a politician who values ​​reality and experience. Today, China needs more and greater assistance from the United States. I think Mr. Hoffman will have a deep understanding of this trip, and bring these fresh insights from the Asian continent back to the American continent. The strengthening of U.S. aid to China in the future should start with Mr. Hoffman's successful visit; this is what we can expect.</p>

<h3>Northeast Materials Adjustment Bureau Has a Dispute Over Stored Food in Hunan; The Hunan Economic Commission Strives to Purchase It</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Changsha, 12th] The Northeast Materials Adjustment Bureau previously purchased 400,000 shi of levied grain in Hunan, and 180,000 shi have been shipped out one after another. The remaining 220,000 shi have also been collected and transported to Changsha early. However, Chang Pan abandoned the city, and in fact, the Northeast no longer needs food. The Hunan Economic Commission approved the purchase at a reserve price to alleviate the food shortage in the province. After the bureau learned about this, it was submitted to the Ministry of Food, which sent a telegram saying that although the Northeast has fallen, there are many public and education personnel who have fled to Tianjin, who are in urgent need of relief, and should still be allowed to be released. However, the Provincial Economic Commission has repeatedly received confidential reports that the bureau has been a commercial organization from beginning to end. At a time when food prices in Changsha are soaring, it is reluctant to provide this batch of grain to commercial organizations in other provinces to seek exorbitant profits.

<h3>Mobilization Period for Suppression of Rebellion: Regulations for Issuing Identification Cards</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 12th] The identification card formats of various provinces, cities, and counties differ greatly, and the content also varies. Inspectors often find it difficult to distinguish between genuine and counterfeit cards, and criminals take the opportunity to forge them, causing confusion. Regarding this matter, according to the Population Bureau of the Ministry of Interior, the current identification cards issued by various provinces and cities are printed independently based on the formats attached to the Implementation Rules of the Household Registration Law. The paper may vary, but the content is uniformly regulated. Only the "Candidate for Public Office" column in the original format was changed to the "National Obligatory Labor" column in January of the 36th year [of the Republic]. Furthermore, the identification card formats previously issued by provinces and cities such as Henan, Jiangsu, and Nanjing differed slightly from the provisions of the Household Registration Law, but they have now been corrected. In order to strengthen the effectiveness and control of identification cards during the mobilization period for the suppression of rebellion, the Ministry has also formulated the Implementation Regulations for the Production and Issuance of National Identification Cards during the Mobilization Period for the Suppression of Rebellion, which have been submitted for approval and promulgation. The full text is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>"Implementation Regulations for the Production and Issuance of National Identification Cards during the Mobilization Period for the Suppression of Rebellion."</p>
<p>Article 1: These regulations are specifically formulated to cooperate with the mobilization for the suppression of rebellion and to strengthen the implementation of the production and issuance of national identification cards.</p>
<p>Article 2: Areas that have not yet produced and issued national identification cards shall, in accordance with the provisions of these regulations, complete the production and issuance within three months after completing household registration. (Areas under pacification shall complete the production and issuance within three months after completing the household census.)</p>
<p>Article 3: The production and issuance of national identification cards shall be based on the records in the household registration book (or the household census form in pacification areas). Subsequent requests for reissue or replacement shall be accompanied by an application. Migrant populations and those serving sentences of imprisonment shall not be issued national identification cards.</p>

<h3>Final Debate on the Korean Question: Soviet Union Uses Delaying Tactics; Third UN General Assembly Adjourns One Day Late</h3>
<p>[United Press, Paris, 12th] The United Nations General Assembly reconvened its plenary session at 2:45 PM today to continue discussing the Korean question.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Paris, 12th] The United Nations General Assembly was originally scheduled to close on the evening of the 11th. However, the Soviet bloc used lengthy speeches to address the Korean issue, preventing the General Assembly from adjourning as scheduled. The meeting on the 11th lasted until 2:00 AM. The President of the General Assembly, Evatt, was exhausted and, hearing the Soviet bloc reiterate its old accusations against the US action in South Korea, resolutely declared a recess. The Ukrainian Foreign Minister, Manuilsky, spoke for 55 minutes first, and the Chinese representative, Chiang Ting-fu, immediately spoke for 8 minutes in response. The Byelorussian representative, Kiselev, also took the stage to deliver a lengthy speech. The Political Committee had already voted to recognize the South Korean government as the legitimate government of Korea and to establish a permanent United Nations Commission on Korea, to be appointed by the nations on the Interim Committee. The Soviet Union strongly opposed this. Manuilsky stepped onto the podium and announced that he intended to discuss the Korean dispute "in detail," continuing to denounce the United States for using terror to force the South Korean elections. He also stated that the United States had no right to unilaterally preside over the Korean elections and that they should be presided over by the major powers. As Manuilsky spoke at length, the representatives appeared unable to bear it. Evatt, who usually listened attentively to the speeches of the representatives, took off his headphones and slumped in his chair. The New Zealand Prime Minister, Fraser, fell sound asleep. Manuilsky protested angrily, but Fraser remained motionless and sound asleep. When Kiselev took the stage, only 145 people remained in the public gallery, barely enough to fill it.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Paris, 12th] The United Nations General Assembly failed to take final action on the Korean question this morning and is scheduled to meet again this afternoon in order to seek a solution to the Korean question before leaving Paris. The General Assembly must pass the joint proposal of China, the United States, and Australia. This proposal has already been passed by an overwhelming majority in the 58-nation Political Committee. It (1) recognizes the Korean government elected under the supervision of the United Nations as legitimate; (2) establishes a Korean commission to continue the work of the current temporary delegation to Korea, with the same member countries; and (3) advocates the rapid withdrawal of the occupying forces stationed in Korea. This proposal is being strongly opposed by the Soviet bloc countries. The Chinese representative, Chiang Ting-fu, spoke after midnight last night, arguing that the General Assembly should complete action on the Korean question at this time. He said, "Our work is only half done. If we make an appropriate decision tonight, 30 million Koreans will be forever grateful." Although the representatives of the Slavic countries are using lengthy speeches to delay the time, observers seem to believe that the Korean question will definitely be put to a vote at this afternoon's meeting.</p>
<h3>Achievements of the Current General Assembly</h3>
<p>[United Press, Paris, 12th] The current General Assembly received a total of 75 proposals, and less than 60 were passed by vote, many of which were minor issues. The important resolutions are listed below:</p>

In his reply, President Auriol praised the representatives of the countries as the bearers of great hope and the workers of noble and arduous tasks.

<p>Self-Salvation and National Salvation United Association Held Inaugural Meeting Yesterday; Military and Political Leaders of This City Were Invited to Attend and Provide Guidance; Support the Head of State in Achieving the Goal of Saving the Nation</p>
<p>[Central News Agency] The Shanghai All Circles Self-Salvation and National Salvation United Association held its inaugural meeting at the Pudong Fellow Villagers Association on Zhongzheng Road yesterday morning at 10:00 AM. Over 1,000 members attended. Commander-in-Chief Tang Enbo, Mayor of Shanghai Wu Guozhen, Garrison Commander Chen Daqing, and directors of various bureaus of this city were all invited to attend and provide guidance. Du Yuesheng, Pan Gongzhan, Xu Jiliang, Qian Yongming, Chen Qicai, Zhang Yi, Yan Huiqing, Wang Xiaolai, Liu Hongsheng, Cheng Zhongxing, Tao Baichuan, Zhou Xuexiang, Zhao Dihua, Ou Yuanhuai, Ling Xianyang, Qin Runxiang, Yang Hu and other 21 people were elected as the presidium, and Du Yuesheng was elected as the chairman to preside over the opening ceremony. The meeting opened at 10:30 AM, beginning with an address by Chairman Du Yuesheng, who briefly stated: Since the government's military suppression has progressed to the Xuzhou-Bengbu area, the battlefront is getting closer to Shanghai, and people in all circles of this city are becoming increasingly nervous. Under this tense atmosphere, although a very small number of people are thinking of escaping, the majority of people are considering how to contribute their strength to protect Shanghai, where we live and work, and to keep it forever complete and prosperous. Shanghai is a key financial and economic center of the country, with a population of more than five million. It is the transportation hub of the country and a major world city. Its importance to China and the world, whether in the past, present, or future, is self-evident. Therefore, loving and protecting Shanghai is not only the responsibility of the people of Shanghai but also the common obligation of people throughout China and the world. To accomplish this arduous task, we must unite the human and material resources of all circles in Shanghai, and under the leadership of the Head of State, launch the work of saving Shanghai and saving the nation. We must also start this movement of self-salvation and national salvation, and even saving the world, in this city, and encourage the compatriots throughout the country to promote it, to win the sympathy and assistance of people who love freedom and peace around the world. The motivation for the organization of this association lies here. Its organizational methods and work program have been carefully formulated. Today, this association is established, and the number of participants is unprecedented. We are infinitely grateful for the presence and guidance of the military and political leaders of this city. Historically, although Shanghai has experienced major disasters, it has always been safe and sound because we were brave in self-help. We hope that this self-salvation and national salvation movement can also inherit our past glory. Let us all muster courage to support the Head of State, quickly achieve the goal of saving the nation and saving the world, and make Shanghai forever a fortress of justice, a beacon of civilization, standing in the Far East.</p>
<p>Pooling Efforts to Seek More Happiness; Concentrating Contributions of Human and Material Resources; Assisting the Government in Reforming Politics</p>
<p>Next, Chairman Pan, as the representative of the preparatory committee, reported on the initiation and preparation process. He stated: Since the National Army withdrew from the Northeast Changpan due to strategic considerations, and Jinan was also lost, and the Xuzhou-Bengbu battle began, people in Nanjing and Shanghai were uneasy, and society was turbulent. A small number of government officials, some local wealthy people, even took their families elsewhere to escape reality. Fortunately, our highest authorities have remained firm and the national policy of suppressing the rebellion has remained unshaken. The soldiers on the front lines shed blood to kill the enemy and defend the territory, and the people in the rear gradually became stable. People from all social organizations in Shanghai who were concerned about national affairs exchanged opinions and agreed that under the current critical situation, strengthening people's hearts, self-salvation, and national salvation is the only way to assist the government in saving the country, hence the establishment of this association. Many people are asking about the situation on the front lines? How about the aid? But no one asks how about themselves? This is a big mistake. If foreigners ask you, what are Chinese people doing themselves? If the soldiers on the front lines ask the compatriots in the rear, how can they contribute to the country, what will we say? Shanghai is an international city, and all actions can play a leading role. We believe that to protect Shanghai, we must concentrate all the strength of the citizens of Shanghai and contribute this entire strength to the country. If the country is saved, Shanghai will also be saved, and we will save ourselves. Mr. Pan said that the cruelty and inhuman practices of the communists can be confirmed by the compatriots who fled to Shanghai from the communist areas. The people's war tactics used by the communists are to force all compatriots in the communist areas, from the ages of eighteen to forty-five, in batches to the front lines of combat, serving as cannon fodder in the first line. Some people in Shanghai are planning to leave Shanghai. This method is a dead end. Their own lives and property must be protected with their own strength in order to be saved. The initiators of this association have held several meetings, and after nearly a month of preparation, drafted an outline of the organization for discussion at the conference. Its members will include all Shanghai legal entities and their directors and supervisors who are determined to save the country, as well as all volunteers who wish to join the association, working together. The purpose of the establishment of this association is to work hard with the goal of supporting the Head of State, assisting the government, and strengthening confidence, hoping to achieve: (1) concentrate and contribute human and material resources to the country and local areas, (2) assist the government in reforming politics, use the strength of the people to urge the government to work hard and govern with the people, and strengthen our foreign policy, so that the anti-aggression camp is more clear, and the political situation is completely new, and then we can gain the attention of international allies and strengthen their assistance to us. As the ancient saying goes, "God helps those who help themselves." Today, the citizens of Shanghai must pool their efforts to support the Head of State and eliminate the communists in the roar of 5 million citizens, which is our responsibility to save ourselves and save the country.</p>
<p>Everyone Must Think from a Distance to Save the Country and Shanghai</p>
<p>Next, Commander-in-Chief Tang Enbo, Mayor Wu Guozhen, and Commander Chen Daqing delivered training speeches separately. Commander-in-Chief Tang said: (1) Saving the country is saving oneself. I hope everyone will think from a distance and think big to save the country and Shanghai. (2) Shanghai's market is related to the country and the world. Please concentrate your strength and exert your strength to save the current crisis. I also hope that the Self-Salvation and National Salvation United Association will maintain order and security in Shanghai, assist the government, and launch national salvation work. (3) We should strengthen our confidence and support the government in order to save ourselves and save the country. At present, the government has inherent shortcomings, and there are also shortcomings in the local area, resulting in such a difficult situation. Therefore, politics must be reformed, and the local area should also be reformed. Moreover, it must be comprehensively reformed to create a new atmosphere and generate new strength in order to save the country and Shanghai.</p>
<p>General Huang Baitao Died for the Country; Shipowner Zhang Hanting's Courage and Righteousness; Soldiers on the Front Lines and People in the Rear Should Emulate Self-Salvation and National Salvation</p>
<p>Mayor Wu said: "Today, the All Circles Self-Salvation and National Salvation United Association of this city is holding its inaugural meeting. I am very excited to be invited to participate in the meeting. This time, all circles in Shanghai are organizing a 'Self-Salvation and National Salvation' group. I am deeply moved by the fact that Shipowner Zhang Hanting of the Jiangya Wheel was able to act bravely and save more than 500 passengers in distress. This chivalrous spirit is enough to influence the world. If each and every one of us is like a courageous and righteous shipowner, we can save ourselves. I recall that since the Battle of Xuzhou-Bengbu, General Huang Baitao wiped out 100,000 communist troops with 50,000 soldiers, defeating the many with the few. In the end, in order to show that he would live and die with his soldiers, he sacrificed himself for the country. This spirit of regarding death as home can serve as a model for military officers in our country. If every soldier on the front line can be like General Huang, our country will be saved. I hope that the soldiers on the front lines and the people in the rear should emulate General Huang, who sacrificed himself for the country, and Mr. Zhang Hanting, who rescued people with courage and righteousness, and work together to save themselves and save the country. Secondly, to defend Shanghai, we must first stabilize Shanghai. To stabilize Shanghai, we must first stabilize people's hearts and respond calmly. The Communist Party is accustomed to using rumors. For example, my wife has been ill for four months, and she is still being treated. The communists spread rumors that my family has moved away. This has little impact on me personally, but it greatly shakes people's hearts. I hope everyone will be safe in their own businesses, not easily believe rumors, concentrate their efforts, save themselves and save the country, and complete the mission.</p>

Du also said that the Shanghai Sino-American business community should immediately hold consultations to establish effective self-defense organizations.

<p>Commander Chen said: I am very pleased that all circles in Shanghai have initiated the organization of the Self-Salvation and National Salvation United Association.
