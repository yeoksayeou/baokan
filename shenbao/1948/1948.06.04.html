<h3>國防部長參謀總長　職權作合理調整　何應欽昨正式到部視事</h3>
<p>〔本報南京三日電〕國防部長與參謀總長職權劃分，過去會有不合理現象，現經蔣總統核准，已予以合理調整，凡屬於軍令部份，如軍隊調動，指揮作戰等，均由參謀總長負責，總長並可直接受總統之指揮。凡屬於軍政部分，如裝備·補給等，均由國防部長負責處理。關於此事，蔣總統五月廿九日對國防部基本原則指示稱：「參謀總長對軍令事宜，以奉總統之命令行之，對軍政事宜，以部長命令行之，或以奉部長諭行之」，此項指示及調整，三日晨何應欽視事時，巳公開向國防部各級官佐報吿。</p>
<h3>華中剿匪總司令　白崇禧即將赴任</h3>
<p>〔本報南京三日電〕新任國防部長何應欽，三日上午十時到部視事，並主持國防部月會，首由前部長白崇禧報吿，謂主持國防部兩年以來，愧無建樹，今後由老長官何部長主持，相信定必能補救過去之缺憾，完成戡亂建國使命。白氏並述其個人之職務，謂戰略顧問委會係總統之戰略諮詢機關，而華中之剿匪責任亦至重大，今後欲求華中剿匪之成功，只有實行民生主義，實行華中總體戰方案，本人即將赴任，希望各位在何部長領導下繼續工作。總由何氏致詞，何謙稱：過去從事軍事工作已卅二年，早擬退休，此次復因蔣總統及翁院長堅挽出任斯職，固辭不獲，只得勉為其難。國防部長一職，依余個人在美之觀感，實以文人出長為宜，此項制度在以政制軍，免流入軍人干政之途，余以軍人而長國防，尤覺與此制度不合，將來仍盼能由文人出任。</p>
<h3>何應欽氏勉僚屬　應專心為國服務</h3>
<p>何應欽氏並述及各國軍事長官儉樸作風，高級長官親至菜塲買菜，乃習見之事，應値得吾人效法，而各國軍人專心軍事，不干涉政治，尤足供吾人借鏡。軍人完全屬于國家，憲法第一三八條規定，全國陸海空軍須超出個人地域及黨派關係以外，效忠國家，愛　人民，故我們不應有任何派系或任何小組織，應專心為國家服務。今後國防部之工作，何氏指出應特別重覦官兵生活，以提高士氣，對於士兵之衣着，亦應早為注意準備。最後並表示，用人決本人才主義，希大家精誠團結，共度時艱，以完成戡亂建國使命。</p>
<p>何氏訓話畢，參謀總長顧祝同亦作簡短致詞，謂目前一般人有兩種心理，一為悲觀，一為消極，均非應有，實則我軍固有不敵匪軍者，但匪軍遇國軍即逃者，亦所在多有，故如國軍將領能指揮運用得當，剿匪決易于　成使命，至十一時許散會，何即至部長辦公室處理公務，午間全體官佐並舉行　餐，送舊迎新。</p>

<h3>美政府所提援華計劃　衆院撥款會通過　運用時期延長至十五月</h3>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓三日電〕美衆院撥款委員會，三日通過美政府所要求之四億六千三百萬美元援華計劃，依原文未予絲毫變動，但該委會在其報吿中，要求執行此次基金之美國機構加以十分嚴裕之管制。該委員會並延長援華基金，以及其他經濟合作總署基金之運用時期，自十二個月延長至十五個月。。</p>
<p>撥款委員會所通過之援華款項，規定一億二千五百萬美元，由中國政府隨意使用。其餘三億三千八百萬美元中，以六千萬美元用於復興計劃。餘下之二億七千八百暑美元之運用為：購買米麥八千五百萬美元，棉花七千二百五十萬美元，石油及石油產物六千五百萬美元，肥田粉二千四百萬美元，烟草一千萬美元，現有資本設備之替換物品二千萬美元，執行費用一百五十萬美元。據美官員談稱，指定撥於中國之七千二百五十萬美元之棉花，將由上海之美國民營棉花進口行代辦。</p>
<p>另據此間經濟合作總署援華部份主管人克里夫蘭談稱：援華計劃之購買手續分為三類：（一）米麥部份，由美政府將辦並運至中國。（二）棉花類部份，經濟合作總署將簽發委託書予美國銀行，令其墊付，由私人機構經手之購買款項。（三）中美兩國政府對中國政府任意購買之物品種類獲致協議後，則以後中國政府所購買之物品，由美國政府付款。</p>
<p>經濟合作總署官員在陳述時，曾吿該委員會稱：彼等擬在中國設立一四七名人員之辦事處，其中廿五人為中國人員，其餘為美人。在華盛頓者處理援華計劃之人員，共計卅六人。經濟合作德署援華部份主管人克里夫蘭在該委員會陳述時稱，援華計劃中之麥與麵粉大部份將運赴北平與天津，可能亦至靑島。食米則大部份運赴上海，廣東，與南京「可能亦運至南部若干較小城市」。</p>
<p>該委員會發表之議事錄中披露，上海美商會對援華計劃之意見書，謂援華計劃「確為當務之急」，但需要嚴格管制以確保事實上人民的確受惠。意見書並籲請取消中國政府所主辦之商業壟斷。美商會要求美國堅持一項援華條件，即對於「內河航運問題，中國應遵守國際習慣」。意見書申言，「為中國私人小團體利益，而對外輪施行之反常限制，現已减低交通沒備甚鉅，而水脚則日益增加」。</p>
<h3>大汶口繼續爭奪　兗州外圍大戰在醞釀中　商印碭山通車國軍會師</h3>

<h3>重建中國農業！</h3>
<p>中國輕濟調查團一行十一人，業經經濟合作總署長霍夫曼明令發表，並將於五日偕同該總署駐華代表團團長　普漢，乘坐專機東來，計程可望於七日飛抵上海；此來任務乃在調查中國經濟情形，從而研究在三億三千人百萬美元援華計劃下所當在中國進行之建設計劃；除了恢復必需之運輸設備，發展燃料電力輸出工業，開採礦產資源，並改善港口設備而外，特別重視中國的農業建設，在這個三億三千八百萬美元的援華計劃之中，特別指定其總額的百分之十，用於農業建設方面；同時在中國經濟調查團中，也有一位農業問題的專家梅逸博士，至其調查中國農藥經濟情形之後，即將向經濟合作總署署長霍夫曼提供如何運用此項基金的方法。此外，又據合衆社一日華盛頓電稱，中美兩國刻正討論設立一農業建設委員會，將由二美人三華人共同組成之，以調查中國在農業建設上之需要。美國如此重視我國農業方面的建設，並積極予以協助，不論從那一個角度去觀察，都覺得其意義是非常重大的。</p>
<p>目前中國的經濟情形，因為共匪叛亂與破壞的範圍日益擴大，確已淑於破產的邊緣；在國家財政，因為收支無法平衡，不得不靠增發通貨來維持，以致造成今日通貨惡性膨脹的現象；在人民生計，因為物價的日漲夜大，幾乎到了民不聊生的地步。所以全國上下鑒於中國經濟危機的嚴重，莫不重視美國援華計劃的運用。援華經費雖以三億三千八百萬美元為限，殆不能應付中國在各方面的需要，但此三億三千八百萬美元，在中國經濟困難的時侯，猶不失為一筆鉅款；如能善為運用，亦足為中國經濟復興的轉　點；反之，若不珍視此一款項，任其浪費虛擲，那末美援自不能奏效，更談不到中國經濟的復蘇。所以如何善用美援，實為我國當前的課題；而美國當局重視美援的用途，並特別重視我國在農業方面的建設，其原因亦即在此。</p>
<p>時至令日，有關民食的農業問題，已成為世界各國當　的嚴重問題。英國經濟學者馬爾薩斯的人口論，謂人口增加的速度　在土地生產糧食的能力之上；這種悲觀的論調，我們固然不必過分重視；但是我們面對着世界各國糧荒的情形，却文不能不特別强調農業增產的重要；所謂「民以食為天」，在世界的任何一角落，若發生了糧荒，當地的社會就不會安定，放眼看看世界各國，都是道種情形，西歐各國的擾攘不安，還不是為了「麵包問題」？亞洲各國的阮隉不安，還不是為了「吃飯問題」？五月十日出版的生活雜誌，也謂在未來的二十五年之中，糧食供應必須增加一倍，否則必發生饑荒。回頭再看看中國，民食的足與不足，往往是中國歷史上治亂的分水綫，所以在　代興亡交巷之際，都有一套改革土地的理論以現。現在土地問題又到了非改革不可的時候了。</p>
<p>我國在歷史上一直是「以農立國」的國家，全國人口百分之八十是農民。在抗戰之前，因為生產技術的墨守成法，再加上通年的天災人禍，農村早已瀕於破產；迨至抗戰軍興，國家旣已到了生死存亡的關頭，對於農村的破落也就視為次要問題。不寗唯是，抑且在抗戰八年期間，有廣大的農村淪於日寇的佔領之下，備受敵人的破壞與摧殘，使千孔百瘡的農村更加衰敗了；其餘　而未被敵人佔領的農村，但是為了祖國的解放，不論在人力和軍糧方面，對於抗戰盡了最大的貢獻，在征實征兵的兩種情形之下，農村自然也只有每况愈下了。勝利後本可休養生息，先謀得農村的復蘇，然後再進一步，使農村繁榮。詎意共匪的叛亂接踵而起，不僅戰亂的烽火，蔓延及農村，而且共匪的摧殘農村，無所不用其極，甚至遠在敵人之上。有些地方，田園荒蕪，根本無人　種；有些地方，雖有人耕種，但因技術肥料的欠缺，收成也已遠不及　昔。所以在農業國裹糧食的供應，也成了嚴重的問題。目前的情形若不設法挽救，則糧荒必將愈演愈烈，國內的紊亂更無法平定了。</p>
<p>凡是研究中國農業的學者，無不異口同聲地說，若欲挽救今日中國農業的危機，則非從土地改革與應用科學技術雙管齊下不可。關於前者，本報社論早已置評，而對於後者，我們不能不特別重視美國對於我國農業建設的協助。但是美國協助我國在農業方面建設的計劃能否達成其預定的目的，我們認為中美兩國均有作進一步努力的必要。在中國方面，須知中國農業問題，乃係制度的改革與技術的利用雙管齊下的問題，單行其一而不能相輔而行，決不能獲致良好的後果。所以我國當局為配合美援計，應該首先實行土地改革，使全國的農村都能做到「耕者有其田」，替美國協助我國在農業方面從事建設奠定一個鞏固的基礎。至於在美國方面，我們亦願乘梅逸博士行將來華之際，向美國當局進一言，美國重視中國農業建設，實為一種賢明的卓見；但是改革中國農　，必須將其重點置於生產技術的改進，使其於短期內即能達到增產的目的。但其所需資金浩大，決非三千餘萬美元所能濟事，所以我們希望賢明的美國當局，對於協助中國在農業方面從事建設，根本解決中國的糧荒問題，自應另成一法案，擴大援助的範圍，以重建中國的農業！</p>
<p>要之，中國經濟的眞正危機，不在都市工商業的衰落，而在農村經濟的破產：我們希望中國政府能在「自力更生」的原則之下，善用美國的援助，實行農村全面建設的政策。</p>

<h3>大別山　無名英雄　廿年戎馬生活　從未負傷一次</h3>
<p>〔本報信陽五月廿九日航訊〕高高的個十，魁梧的身材，英俊，豪爽，這使是縱橫大別山區到處予共匪以重傷的無名英雄張旭東將軍。</p>
<p>淮北走廊　　氛</p>
<p>他是河南商城人，十八歲從軍，當時他率領着一百多人，在家鄕　匪，因年靑有為，勇敢善戰，屢建奇功，為上峯器重，兩年後，升任大隊長，時値江西　共高潮，劉鎭華坐鎭豫鄂皖邊區，担任淸剿工作，張氏以一營　衆，　　匪軍一師，頗為劉將軍所　識，　升為副　隊長。至民國廿四年，張學良任剿匪總司令，中原改組，政治的暗流驅使着他悄悄地離開了奮鬥七年的崗位，去到鄰省安徽，投効他的老長官，服務於十一路軍，迨抗戰爆發，家鄉父老屢次敦促，他又重新回到大別山，樹立抗戰的旗幟，將過去的舊屬組織起來，編成一支鐵的勁旅，像一條穿山甲，在大別山的　林裹穿來穿去，消滅了無數的敵寇，破壞了幾十座　槡，割斷電統五百斤之多，至勝利以還，以多年之豐功，為家鄉人士擁戴，膺任商城縣長。卅六年，中原共匪猖獗，劉伯承繼李先念之後流竄大別山，張氏因職責所在，急不容綏，放棄縣長的政治生涯，東山再起，利用昔日的幹部，號召民衆的力量，成立了今天的保安團。廿年來，他一直在風沙裏馳騁着，對於大別山的田舍，山水，以及每一條小溝小溪小徑，都熟習得像一幅圖案，時時刻刻懸掛在他的腦海　，所以他能立足在大別山，他能以一座正陽孤城控制作河北岸的大平原，使共匪不能暢所欲為的在淮北的走廊上散步。</p>
<p>子弟兵來自故鄉</p>
<p>記者此次在正陽勾留一天，雖然承他的一番盛意招待我，飲食起居在一道，同時忙於拜訪地方行政首長以及戰塲的巡視，使我抽不出一點空和他暢談，為了次晨要走，直至晚上十一時，才徵得他的同意，作一次長談。當他談起他的部隊成長的經過時，他像似叙述一個保姆撫育嬰兒長大成人一樣，費盡心血，飽當困難，才好容易維持到今天。</p>
<p>他的士兵可說是子弟兵，多半來自家鄉，雖不是眞正的親族關係，但，鄕土的情誼，和七八年乃至十多年來的甘苦患難與共，使他與弟兄們之間巳開闢了一條永遠流不盡的感情的河流。</p>
<p>輕裝機動性強大</p>
<p>他的部隊是　正民間的武力，自己帶槍，自動地打匪，這是唯一的一支人民隊伍，他具備了頗多優點，輕裝，機動性大，化整為零，化零為整，在抗戰中，他們在農忙時若沒有戰况便放假回家栽秧種田，三個月和六個月，仍然又不約而同的回來，態一支不少，人一個不缺。他的部　紀律良好，秋亳無犯，他們不求虛榮，只求實際，只曉得埋頭苦幹，不管國家知道不知道，始終　着自己的崗位，他們的戰績並不亞於國軍，在　　以兩營之衆，守了七天，劉伯　帶着四個縱隊，輪流猛攻，終　越　池一步，柳林大捷，他們以一班人的兵力衝進匪軍司令部，俘虜了匪軍的高級畏官，鹵獲了很冬戰利品，這次在正陽，又與四萬多圍城之匪苦戰，終將匪擊潰，造成空前大捷，他們有這許多功勞，但一點不驕傲，還是繼續地任勞任怨發揮苦卓堅絕的精神。</p>
<p>他當了十年了校</p>
<p>談起他們的特遇，說來可憐，簡直比不上上海的乞丐。副食費少，薪餉低，不必說得，而且這些錢的來源，不是依賴國家供給，而是由富有正義感的地方士紳和民衆所支持的，他們吃不飽，睡不安，沒有薪餉，不圖名，不求利，為的是什麼，無疑問的是為着一個戡亂建國的大目標，他們的弟兄時常這樣說：「我們只要　到自已的責任，國民應有的一份天職，至於國家是不是要給我們待遇，或者是獎勵，那是另外一件事。」張團長也這樣說：「我有一分力，盡一分力，我守一個城，一定堅守到底，直到一槍一彈，仍然拚到底。」我們足足談了三個鐘點，却毫無一點倦達，時間太無情了，第二天還要動身，我們相互地懷着一種依依的情緒，在子夜兩點鐘，結束了這一次畏談，走出他的寢室，那些戰士們活潑跳躍的影子好似還盤旋在我的腦海的記憶里。</p>
<p>廿年來的戎馬生涯，他從未負過一次傷，記功十一次，得過兩次勳章，當了十年上校，聽說，最近張司令官已把他升為　將了，我默默地為這位無名英雄祝福。　（本報記者卜眠）</p>

<h3>對付蘇聯鐵拳　美有擴軍必要　陸軍參謀長促國會通過預算</h3>
<p>〔路透社華盛頓二日電〕衆院撥款委會頃發表陸軍參謀長勃雷特萊就國防預算撥款事，向該會所作之證辭。勃氏謂蘇聯武裝部隊總計四百萬人，飛機約一萬四千架，乃莫斯科侵略政策的鐵拳，其軍力可以迅速席捲歐洲之大部份·近東·中東·以及朝鮮甚至中國。此等軍事能力，姑不論其用意何在，已足為對美國安全之重大威脅。渠認美國之需要有明晰規定及適當支持的軍事政策，未有較今日更為迫切者。</p>

<h3>英上院否決　廢止死刑案</h3>
<p>〔路透社倫敦二日電〕上院頃以一八一對廿八票，通過刪除刑事法案中試行廢止死刑五年之款，而將該案發回下院·刑事法案係於四月間經下院通過，廢止死刑之款係經各黨議員自由投票後通過加訂。政府鑒於戰後罪行之增加，原反動廢止死刑，然以此　與黨政無關而係良心問題，故准許工黨議員自由投票。</p>

<h3>貝那多特正與阿猶接觸　商聖地停戰日期　美軍官廿一人擬參加監督停戰</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕倫敦三日廣播：開羅訊，貝那多特刻正與猶阿雙方接觸，商巴勒斯坦停戰之確切日期，衆料停戰當能於本屋期日實現。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕紐約三日廣播：華盛頓訊，美國已試行選定陸海空軍官廿一人，以便為聯合國在巴勒斯坦督察停戰，目下尙在等待聯合國正式提出邀請。</p>
<p>〔聯合社成功湖二日電〕聯合國安全理事會今夜訓令巴勒斯坦戰事調解員貝那多特儘速就地規定阿拉伯與猶太雙方開始停戰時間。此項決議未付表決即宣吿通過，僅蘇聯與烏克蘭聲明放棄同意權。</p>
<p>據蘇聯方面解釋，此係當初即不贊成派遣調解員之一貫主張。訓令係田六月份輪値主席叙利亞代表柯里當塲簽字發出。柯氏並宣布於星期四下午開會討論停戰監督事宜。先是，安理會接獲阿猶雙方復電接受停戰四星期之建議後，即開會討論實施辦法，主席柯氏並裁定阿猶雙方已無條件接受休戰，雙方復文所列解釋與意見不能視為條件。美代表奧斯汀及其他代表旋相繼主張給予調解員三日時間實行停戰，未獲通過。同時，巴勒斯坦猶太軍巳於今日日落時將以色列政府所發第三次停戰令作罷，猶太代表在安理會散會後宣布，猶太軍已取消第三次停戰令，正再度作戰，但一俟調解員規定四星期停戰開始時間，猶太軍自當遵守。此間一部份猶太人對於安理會採取冷嘲態度。</p>
<p>〔路透社成功湖三日電〕安理會定於三日開會討論應採何種管　擔施以執行巴勒斯坦之休戰。在休織令開始豐施以前，猶阿任何一方　有很誠作戰行為，自尙不能視為　已違背休戰命令。</p>
<h3>與安理會談判停戰期間　阿盟將繼續作戰　猶都東北南激戰未休</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕紐約三日廣播：台拉　夫訊，猶太政府對於停戰前途，甚為悲觀。據一切可靠消息，阿方在與安理會談判停戰之條件期間，將繼鐵作戰。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕倫敦三日廣播：開　訊，今日奈格勃沙漠與臺拉維夫之東北與東南，戰事仍在進行中。又訊，英外交部宣佈，所有乒役年齡之猶太靑年一律禁止自塞浦魯斯島前往巴勒斯坦。</p>
<p>猶太軍進迫　阿盟爾要城</p>
<p>〔合衆社臺拉維夫三日電〕以色列軍前敵來訊，三日稱，猶軍在巴勒斯坦中部，大舉進攻集寗及杜爾康兩阿拉伯要城，刻距兩地僅一哩至三哩之遙。猶軍一支，自耶茲利谷出擊，　越阿馬奇頓平原，長驅直入，距集寗僅一哩。又訊，合拉維夫城東北二十一哩杜爾康城附近，大戰在進行中。以色列軍佔下勃奇高地，距杜城僅三哩，並在那布西區驅出大批阿軍，上週阿方稱，伊拉克軍自杜爾康出發，直抵海濱，將以色列國切成兩截，伊軍最近之公報則稱，杜城東六哩克法榮奈地方發生砲擊。據前敵來訊，猶軍初次使用排砲，進攻集寗，杜爾康猶軍界稱，猶軍於二日上午三時遵守時機未熟之停戰令，致戰事一度中止，現各綫攻勢已告恢復。</p>
<h3>美援日韓復興費　衆院撥欵委會未予批准</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕紐約三日廣播：華盛頓訊，本日衆院撥款委員會力促將馬歇爾計劃及其他援外計劃之經費，削减百分之廿五。該委會巳將此項意見提交衆院，大致將於明日發生激辯。該委會主張全球之援助經費，應减為六十億〇四千三百萬美元。按美元計，僅較原來數額减少百分之七。惟時間方面，復將原定之十二個月延長至十五個月，因此等於削减百分之廿五。至於對華援助四億六千三百萬美元，則未予變更。</p>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓二日電〕衆院撥款委會通過援華計劃基金，絲奄未予變更，但未通過美政府要求用以復興日本·朝鮮·琉球之二億二千萬元中之一億五千萬美元。該委會王張，如政府欲以一億五千萬元復興遠東之佔領區，可自其他經濟合作總署計劃之款項中抽出。但該委會通過政府要求救濟日本與朝鮮人民之全部款項，計日本四億二千四百萬元，朝鮮一億〇七百萬元，以防止疾病與不安。</p>
<h3>韓憲法委會　開始起草工作</h3>
<p>議會昨休會八日重開</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社漢城三日電〕南韓國民議會業已組成憲法起草委員會，自今日下午起該會召開秘密會議，開始起草未來南韓之憲法工作。國民議會今日已暫行休會，待至六月八日再開。聯合國朝鮮委員會委員預料將於七日自上海返抵此間。按渠等之來滬，係起草有關南韓五月十日之選舉報吿書將來提出聯合國者。</p>
<p>〔聯合社開羅二日電〕據外約但京城報吿，猶太軍一隊數百人衝入外約似邊境十八哩，截至正午已被外約但陸空軍擊退，死四十人。</p>
<h3>阿盟對休戰建議　提九點意見</h3>
<p>主設公正機構監督停戰</p>
<p>〔路透社開羅二日電〕阿拉伯諸國對安理會聖地休戰建議提出之答覆，曾提出下列九點：（一）阿拉伯政府所願者莫甚於聖地和平之恢復，及猶阿居民之得以友好共處。阿拉伯政府認為必須有休戰之保證，不然休戰適足為更大規模的戰鬥之準備耳；（二）阿拉伯政府承認安理會已考慮彼等前此所提之意見，即休戰僅各覓取合理解決的方法，因此阿拉伯國對於安理會之任命斡旋專員，與猶阿雙方保持接觸甚感滿意；（三）斡旋專員之主要使命為獲取和平而合理的解決辦法。阿拉伯政府確信該斡旋專員將確認不遵從當地大多數居民的意志，及不符合巴勒斯坦政治統一原則的決議案，決不能有成功的希望；（四）開放巴勒斯坦之門戶，准許猶太人之無限制移入，無疑的與休戰宗旨相悖，此為對於巴勒斯坦阿拉伯族及中東整個安全最大的威脅；（五）阿拉伯玫府確信安理會之目的決不可能為允許猶太人憑休戰之利，而使大批已及軍役年齡之壯丁藉移民為名，湧入巴勒斯坦。蓋此等壯丁，顯然即為安理會決議案第二章內禁止於休戰期內進入巴勒斯坦之戰鬥人員；（六）阿拉伯政府希望得有公正有為的機構，以監警安理會與休戰令有關決議之執行；（七）阿拉伯政府不信安理會之決議巳具有適當的保證，以確保雙方之將恪遵休戰條件及規則。職是之故，阿拉伯國政府，以阿拉伯聯盟會員之資格，願與斡旋專員及聯合國休戰委員會合作，以監督休戰規律及條件之執行；（八）阿拉伯政府為期聖地和平得以建立以覓取合理的解決辦法起見，謹接受安理會所提休戰四星期之建議，該項期限自尙待決定之期日起算；（九）阿拉伯政府之接受此議，足證其具有與聯合國合作以覓取合理解決辦法之誠意。</p>
<h3>美增強在日基地　橫須賀已成為小珍珠港　本州巨型機塲離海參僅七百哩</h3>
<p>〔路透社東京二日電〕此間盟國觀察家，覺美國對日政策已漸有變更，美軍已不擬僅為純粹的佔領軍，而擬增强在日本之基地。美國似已不欲迅速召開對日和會，俾得延長其駐日期間，麥帥最近雖重申早日召開對日和會之志願，但其意見似並未獲得陸軍當局及國務部之充分支持。今在九州，本州，北海迫諸島，日本原有之飛機塲均已大事擴充。</p>
<p>九州最近並未完成新機塲一處，而本州北端正在建築有可以容納美國尙在設計中的最巨型轟炸機之機塲。該地距海參戰，固僅七百哩，非正式估計該機塲建築費，合美金一千三百萬元。遠東委會旣已不許日本自關國內外航綫，則此等機塲顯然非為日本之用，美海軍在日基地續須賀，亦正作永久之計，其新設工程，不啻一小型之珍珠港。此等象徵均足表示美國之不欲離開日本。美高級官員雖否認美國將扶植日本成為其軍事盟國，但並不否認美國之將根據軍事需要而留在日本。除軍事設備外，美國在日亦已耗去大宗金鈔，如果屈拉普之建議實現，則所耗金錢將更多，美國當然不願此一在遠東之鉅額投資，隨對日和約之訂立，而落入對方之經濟勢力圈以內。</p>
<h3>促麥帥返國事　事實上已打消</h3>
<p>美參院撥委會幷無新建議</p>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓三日電〕參院撥款委會三日並未採取進一步行動，以促令麥帥返國陳述遠東時局。由於撥款委會不採取正式行動，顯然該問題已被認為過去。該會恐不致在共和黨全國代表大會召開前，邀請麥帥返國。</p>
<h3>暗殺甘兇手　廿二日續審</h3>
<p>〔聯合社新德里三日電〕暗殺甘地之兇手蓋賽等九人，今日獲准在獄中與政治犯享受同等優待，可自費由外界送食，自行薙面，並在通風設備較佳之囚房居住。同時，法庭原定十四日開審，現已宣布延期至廿二日舉行，各被吿應在十四日出庭再受預審。</p>
<h3>亞經會爭論　印尼參加問題</h3>
<p>對印尼地位各國意見分歧</p>
<p>〔路透社印度南部奧達長蒙二日電〕聯合國亞洲與遠東經濟委員會今日開會未一小時，即因印尼代表之地位問題而起爭執。此一問題在經委會上次會議中，即已提出討論，然未獲得解決。問題乃為日惹之印尼共和國政府，將為準會員國，抑將為荷蘭代表團之一部。英法支持荷蘭之意見，而印度·澳洲·緬甸·錫蘭及巴基斯坦則贊成由印尼代表以準會員國代表地位參加。蘇聯代表亦支持印度之意見。</p>

<p>〔路透社貝爾格軌三日電〕南斯拉夫於今日起實　全國男女靑年之强迫軍事訓練，各城鎭鄉村以及中學大學，均將開辦軍事訓練班。中學靑年於十七歲起受訓訓，加入陸軍服役時為止，女生受訓期至廿七歲為止。據云此舉用意在使每一靑年均有保衛祖國之軍事常識。</p>
<p>〔聯合社倫敦二日電〕南斯拉夫官方通訊社今日宣稱，南斯拉夫政府已分別召回其駐英與駐土兩國大使，但此舉究因循例召回述職，抑係撤退，則未說明。</p>

<h3>特刑庭宣判不受理　舞潮案移送地檢處　大部份在押男婦被告後日可望保釋</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕轟動一時之舞潮案，自警局將該案移送特種刑庭審理後，該案於昨日下午二時在特庭宣判。聞訊前往旁聽者甚衆。二時十分王震南　長·孫體鈐·徐乃　審判官，徐樂詩書肥官升座，提在押被吿朱　等三十七名，傳交保被吿三十名，分立兩側立此時法庭情緒頓形緊張，各人目光皆注視法案上之判決書，不知何人處刑。旋王庭長起立宣讀判決書主文；「本件不受理」，被吿聆判後一片「謝謝庭長」聲。哭喪臉之洪小萍·王敏，至此亦破涕為笑。嗣由徐書記官起立朗讀判決書理由，並加以說明，略謂。「被吿所犯罪嫌，係屬普通刑事，並去構成戡亂時期危害國家緊急治罪條例第七條之　，警局移送本庭審理，起訴程序顯已違背規定，諭知不受理，移送地檢處辦理。」王庭長對本案再略加說明，在押被告全體舉手請求交保未準，論知即移送地檢處偵查，三時退庭三時三十分特種刑　備文將在押被告朱　等三十七名，移解　檢處，黃亮首席檢察官即派何惠民，張元鎭兩檢察官辦理此案。略訊各被吿姓名年籍，因案卷浩繁，審閱需時，未准交保，暫　　南路看守所。惟聞後日大部份可望保釋。</p>
<p>判決理由</p>
<p>茲將該案判決理由原文探錄於後：「查自中央頒佈禁舞令後，本市舞廳從業人負，為生活計，勞資雙方合組一上海市舞廳業全體同人聯合辦事處，專為禁舞問題作與當局折衝之機構。於是籌集經費，推舉代表赴京請願，未有成效。旋上海市社會局為執行中央命令，顧到事實，決定分期禁絕，、訂於本年一月卅一日下午三時，舉行第一期抽籤。舞廳業聯合辦事處聞訊，召集全體人員，於是日在新仙林舞廳開會商討抽籤問題。忽消息傳來，謂社會局已於上午十一時舉行代抽籤，抽中米高美等十四家舞廳，應行停業。是時會塲情緒驟形緊張，一致要求赴社會局請願，即於下午三時勞方舞女及職工約共數千人，（內僅金英一人非舞女，係為舞女陳菊萍所邀往），分赴社會局請願，要求暫緩禁舞，以維生活。適社會局正在開會，未能即時出見，請願之羣衆咸覺失望，一時為</p>
<p>情感衝動</p>
<p>紛紛登樓搗毀社會局，所有門窗玻璃器具等件，幾被毀無道。上海市勞資評斷委員會在社會局三樓辦公，請願羣衆誤為社會局，同遭波及。隨往維持秩序之警察，因阻止搗毀，而被毆傷者約有十餘人。斯時社會局內之秩序異常紊亂，上海市警察局據報，即派隊馳往彈壓，先後捕獲多人。偵訊結果，認定朱罪等六十九名，有意圖擾亂治安，以其他方法毀壞公署之嫌疑，係犯戡亂時期危害國家緊急治罪條例第七條之罪，依特種刑事案件訴訟條例第三條第二項之規定，除將俞志琴等三十二名交保候傳外，將朱霏等三十七名移請審判前來。茲就審理結果，無論被吿中何人實施毀損，何人毆傷警察，</p>
<p>先決問題，本案應否適用戡亂時期危害國家緊急治罪條例，由本庭審判，當以被吿等有無意岡擾亂治安以其他方法毀壞公署為斷。關於此點，約可分析言之，（一）毀壞公署，所謂公署乃社會局用以辦公之整個建築物，現所被毀者，僅屋內之門窗玻璃器具等件，非建築物之要部，依前大理院三年上字第四七〇號「損壞建築物罪，須損壞建築物之要部，足致建築物　其效用，罪乃成立，若僅損壞附屬物，則屬損壞物件　之範圍」，判例認定，自難以毀壞公署論。（二）意圖擾亂治安。查集合多數人實施毀損，影響所及，秩序固然受其妨害，以言擾亂治安，核與最高法院廿二年上字第一九四二號「所謂擾亂治安，係指擾亂行為，足使地方上一般之安寗秩序，受有妨害而言」之判例，旣嫌未盡符合，况其赴社會局之目的，核閱上海市警察局投長朱夢威，與科員金興國兩次調查報吿書，曁舞應業歷次開會之會議錄，以及被吿等一致之供述，其動機　為要求</p>
<p>暫緩禁舞</p>
<p>面請願，尚乏意岡擾亂治安積極之證明。試再證以嵩山警察分局政治組長李　英所供：「那天我奉命隨往社會局察看，先時秩序尙好，後求見局長，據聞局長開會未能接見，大槪舞女氣憤，以致臨時發生打社會局。」益覺信而有徵。至其於搗毀時，將執行職務之　察毆傷，亦只能成立刑法上之防害公務與傷害罪。由以上兩點論斷，被吿等所犯罪娥，均屬</p>
<p>普通刑事</p>
<p>案件、並未構成　亂時期危害國家緊急治罪條例第七條之罪原移　機關移送本庭審理，起訴程序顯巳違背規定，自應諭知不受理，移送上海地方法院檢察處，依法辦理。基上論結，合依特種刑事法庭審判條例第二條，刑事訴訟法第二百九十五條第一款各規定，爰為判決如主文。」</p>

<h3>王庭長如此說　此地是火坑　跳出已是大幸</h3>

<p>在押被吿益見憔悴，交保被吿依然逍遙，揚子尤玲玲還塗了口紅，百樂門榮英鳳今天穿了件黑旗抱，比幾天前樸實了一點。書記官朗讀判決書，庭內寂靜無聲，眞所謂「此時無聲勝有聲」，替代了多少人內心的愉快。</p>
<p>王庭長在判決書　完以後，親致訓詞：「本件不受理，並不是指你們沒有罪，乃是說你們的罪並不是危害國家的罪，所以今天在押被吿要解地檢處去審判。但你們不要怕，要知這裹是火坑，能讓你們跳出，已是大幸，如果將來法院判你們的罪，希望你們要平心靜氣的服罪。同時我還勸你們以後去從事生產建設事業，跳舞是消費的，對國家有什麼好處。」要是庭內准許的話，想來必定有人會大大鼓掌。律師要求交保，王庭長說：「本案旣不受理，本庭就樣樣不管，請勿讓我給別人說是放馬後砲。「在押被吿送到地檢處，臨行前，洪小萍。唐宗傑。王敏。馮愛娜·朱霏等急急傳語家屬說：「快！快到盧家灣去，想法子交保！」</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕中國福利基金會上海兒童工作組，昨日下午五時起，在蒲石路華懋公寓十一樓舞廳舉行兒童福利義賣會，孫夫人宋慶齡女士親臨主持，應內懸燈結綵，佈置入勝。陳列之義賣品除本市國際名流捐贈者外，並有戰前孫夫人募集後運至歐洲銷售之古物十餘箱，此項古物運至法國時適値德軍入佔，遂致輾轉　傳八年之久，最近始自馬賽尋獲運回。其中包括古瓶，古畫，珍貴刺繡，掛裙禮服等等。娛樂部份有釣紙魚，擲圏，擲球，打槍，及白俄阿爾康夫人算命等等。塲內由名媛淑女担任職員，本巿中國名流及各國仕女前往觀賞購買者甚為踴躍，衣香鬢影，盛極一時。義賣會至夜十一時始結束，售出義物甚多，收入總數因時間已晏未及結算。此項義賣所得將全部作為上海貧苦兒童敎育及醫藥工作之經費。</p>

<h3>約大校長宣布辭職　校務暫由校董會執委負責　學生間數起衝突傷兩人</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕聖約翰大學學生間，昨日一日發生衝突多起。已被校方處分停學一年之學生會主席史久餘受重傷，另一遭受校方同樣處分之學生會聯絡部部長陳文涵（女）亦受傷。其他輕傷者尙有數人。校長涂羽卿因此次學校發生風潮，深感難以處理，昨日上午決定辭職，除正式向校董會提出辭呈外，並於校內發表佈吿稱：「羽卿自受任主特校務以來，在極端困難環境中維持校務，力求安定。惟德薄能鮮，不克勝任，爰已向校董會提出辭呈，並自即日起一切校務交由校務執行委員會辦理，望諸同學愛護學校，保持鎭靜態度，勿作規外行動為要。此布」。</p>
<p>全體學生·召開大會</p>
<p>緣聖約翰大學校方鑒於連日因學生會主持之反美扶日民族展覽會而引起之騷動情况，乃於二日晚召開臨時校務會議，決定自三日起至八日止停課一週，本學期大考提前於九日開始（原定於廿一日舉行），停課期問所有校內敎室·交誼室·大禮堂均一律關閉，不得借用。學生聞悉突然停課消息後，頗感驚訝，多認為即使一部份學生行動越規，亦係少數之事，今校方突然停課提前大考，影響大多數學生學業。且各系科課程多未有結束，倉猝應付考試，頗感困難。該校學生自治會乃於昨晨召開全體學生大會，商討此事。</p>
<p>提供意見·未作答覆</p>
<p>因交誼室，大禮堂等均已封閉，乃假南草地開會，出席一千餘學生，會議進行時，學生意見不能一致，一部份學生並指責學生會為何祗反美不反蘇？紛擾中，除校長曾出而勸導，聲稱學校當局決定停課之舉，係求校內安定，並無其他作用。會議旋於繼續進行時，因主席台桌椅被掀翻，遂吿中止。一部份學生推派代表數人往謁校長，提供意見數點：（一）根據本學期初校方徵求各同學家長對學生會意見結果，處理所謂學生會。（二）要求校方嚴厲懲處一切非法集會負責人及煽動份子。（三）要求校方為本校及全體學生名譽，向各界聲明此次少數份子搗亂學校事件眞相。校長未作　體答覆，未及半小時，即以辭職聞。</p>
<p>兆豐公園·發生武劇</p>
<p>學生會暫停開會後，學生即陸續離去，但仍有數百人三五成羣，逗留不去，其間並小有衝突。至午十二時許，史久餘，陳文涵二人，即在兆豐公園內被人毆擊受傷，其中數人並持有武器。後經公園內之警士救出，代理訓導長潘世茲亦聞訊趕到，受傷一一人乃由同學扶送至同仁醫院急救，至晚己由其親友陪同移往他處治療。　此事發生後，校董會一部份校董即於下午非正式集會交換意見，對史久餘，陳文涵二人受傷事，認為出事時史陳二人係從校內被拖出外，行兇地點既在校外，且團　者之身份不明，此乃治安問題，校方無從處理，乃決定將此事報吿治安當局聽候處置。至涂校長辭職事，需待顏惠慶董事長自京返一滬後召間全體董事會討論。目前校務暫由校董會執行委員會負責。</p>
<h3>紀念禁煙節　全市懸旗　外灘焚毒</h3>

<p>〔本報訊〕本市各碼頭運輸窰貨磚瓦石灰工人二千一百餘人，昨晨分乘卡車五十七輛，向社會局·市政府·警察局·總工會請願，陳述唐學元等利用地方勢力，爭奪營業，並於談家灣附近聚衆圍毆理事長王立海等前後經過，要求懲兇，保障工作安全，追究閘北警分局失職員警等七項。請願工人於上午九時一刻抵達社會局，由第二處處長王家樹接見，允將各項糾紛情形轉請警局及地檢處查明眞相後，依法辦理。繼往市府及警察總局·市總工會等處請願，提出同樣要求。吳市長親自延見工人代表，勸諭靜待合理解決，至下午一時半始散去。因全市工人均參加請願，故昨日各碼頭磚瓦石灰窰貨之運輸，均吿停頓，今日起當可恢復正常。</p>
<h3>輪船各綫運費　明起漲價九成</h3>

<h3>規定影院低價座額　社局決予嚴格執行</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕社會局吳局長為影院反對低價限價座及西片商要求調整票價，否則將停供西片公映一事，昨發表　話稱：各影院保持百分之卅低價座位，係經市政會議通過，俾使大多數市民均能享受娛樂，故決嚴格執行，不因影院反對而中止。社會局將與警局會街揭示佈吿，將抵價座位圖張貼於各影院門前，俾市民週知。吳局長解釋各影院百分之卅以外之座位，當局並不限制其票價。該業公會可依照生活指數調整方式，根據其他物價上漲比率推算。各影院調整票價後，如能保持其營業上之把握，當局自不予千涉，而低價座位票價亦並非固定不變。至西片　將停供西片一節，吳局長表示並不重視。</p>
<h3>參會決議案檢討會　今日會商訪問對象</h3>

<h3>欠租判付美鈔　自有法律根據</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕本市上海酒樓之房屋，係租用新仙林舞廳者，因欠租金，前經地院判處上海酒樓應付給所欠房租美鈔一千元。本市房客聯合會對此判決表示抗議，認為此例一開，將來三房客將有不勝負擔之苦。記者昨走訪地院負責人，渠對此判決解釋如下：（一）上海酒樓與新仙林舞廳訂約係在三十五年七月十八日，在政府公布禁止黃金外幣流通辦法以前，此時以美鈔訂約，自不能認為違法。（二）上海酒樓欠租是在三十二年七月至同年十一月，市政府尙未公佈房屋租賃條例。（三）判決付給美鈔，係按中央銀行掛牌滙率折合法幣計算，故對於上海酒樓幷無喫虧之處。</p>

<h3>伯大尼二百餘孤兒　面臨流離失所邊緣　各界人士同情捐助者眾</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕交通路伯大尼孤兒樂園，為基督徒錢團運牧師艱苦創辦，迄今已有六年歷史，收容孤兒二百餘人，成績斐然，衆口交譽。不幸其涉訟經年之房屋糾紛，最近經最高能院判決敗訴，二百餘孤兒已臨於流離失所之邊緣。各界人士對於該孤兒院之遭遇極為同情，紛紛以精神物質鼓勵，勉錢牧師繼續努力，當經伯大尼董事會發起募捐，購地建屋之基金，本市各大報館及大陸銀行均代收捐教，以一千五百億為口標，使二百餘孤兒不致流離失所。現悉各界輸將者甚為踴躍巳有大中磚瓦廠胡一德君願捐贈浦東南滙土地一百餘畝，另有葉伯翔君亦願捐贈大塲土地六百餘畝，昨日更有農工銀行副經理某君親至該孤兒園捐款一千萬元，另有某小學生，致函錢牧師，願將節省零食錢三萬元捐獻，誠意至可感人。惟悉該伯大尼　讓之期，對方催促甚迫，前已在法庭上堅持須在五日內遷出，結果由法院決定限期為十二日，但事實上新址決難於十二日內覓定。各界對此極為關切，均望勝訴之一方體念孤兒痛苦，予以延長期限云·</p>
<h3>日漁輪船員供認　大規模侵我漁權　筆録五十頁整理就緒昨晚携京　是否將作俘虜處置現尚未可知</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕上月廿九日淸晨，我海軍中建艦在長江口外沙尾山附近截獲日漁船雲仙丸二十二號上船員十一人及擊沉震仙丸一一十一號上船員十三人，均經拘押於海軍第一基地司令都內，自五月卅一日至本月二日，由該部軍法室主任李有鑑觀作　續三晝夜之　訊，結果獲悉此次日漁船在我　　　　魚，實為有計劃的侵犯我海權。據雲仙丸二十一號船長下村和十供稱：「本來北方魚多，惟該處甚為危險，經常有蘇聯漁船在北緯三八度以北巡邏，故到南方來。「同時根據各船員供詞，知日漁船前來捕魚，已非一次，至出動之漁船，數字極為可觀，據下村和十稱；「此行共二十艘，分為十組，…大公司有山田·林金·日東·日本水產等四家，其餘小公司很多，單林金一家即有二三十組」。船員熊浦敏久稱：」公司一起有十組，先開出入組，我們是第九組開出。「渠並供稱「二十二號船長說過一次，現在我們的船要到中國內海去，是　開長崎時說的。「由此可知日漁船開航時，　早已決定侵我海擭。</p>
<p>對我優待表示感激</p>
<p>據海軍第一基地司令都新聞室主任李月林語記者稱：根據船員川口忠　供：「　初水是綠的，後來變成黃褐色，心想恐怕到了中國的長江口外」等語，可知確在我國領海（包括漁權區域）之內，實毫無疑問。變又稱：經三日審訊後，所有船員俱承認在中國領海內捕魚，係侵越海權，違反國際公法，請求政府原諒，同時對我海軍當局之優待，頗為感激，咸盼能早日結案，將若輩遣送返日，且保證決向公司當局報吿此行經驗，以後當加注意云。</p>
<p>所扣船隻移補給站</p>
<p>惟海軍總司令部對此案極為重視，連電催令將所有口供送部核奪，現將是項口供整理就緒，約有五十頁之多，已於昨晚派員携京，所扣船隻，亦移送至海軍第一補給站。至我與日本尙未訂立和約，發生外交關係，似亦未解除交戰狀態，故所扣押之船員，是否將作俘虜處置，目下尙不可料。關於船上所綱之群魚，已畫海軍總部指示或交海關，或作價出售，以價款百分之二十作為此次中建艦出力官兵之獎金；截至目前止，亦未有決定。</p>
<p>居心叵測不言可喻</p>
<p>最後李主任並向記者發表感想稱：「日漁船侵我漁權，迭經交涉並由盟總規定界域，自不容再讓侵犯，此番獲案漁船，經審訊結果，舛實為一大規模之侵犯漁總行動，且數量龐大，同時該項漁船有海圖，測深儀，羅盤，電訊等海上所需工具，一應俱全，其來中國領海捕魚，雖云受潮流影響，惟據其居心不言可喻，惜該組（每組二艘）領隊廿一號船巴被擊沉，而未及將船內有關贓證及各項記載搶運，致使本案調查及將來處理上增加若干困難。至受傷船員小田孝一名，已送海軍第一醫院醫治中」。</p>
<p>又海軍方面日前續派軍艦至凉崗島及海難島一帶追緝日漁船，截至目前止，基地司令部尙未接獲若何報吿。</p>

<h3>三機關聯席會議決定　外幣存單抵用辦法　面由進口商提騐結匯證明書</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕政府收購無證自備外匯到埠貨品應行付給原進口商之特種外幣存單，依照規定原得按李向央行抵借票面六分之一，支付其限額以內許可入口之貨款。茲因新結匯辦法公佈後，登記合格之進口商於獲得許可證後，在給購外匯時，除繳付牌價之國幣外，並須提供結匯證明書，方准結購外匯，昨經央行輸管會及中信局聯席會議決定中信局優先配售此項貨品時，仍依規定照平準會牌價收款，至付給原進口商之特種外幣存單，仍應於每六分之一到期時，照平準會脾價兌換法幣，如由登記合格之進口商以此項存單按季抵付許可進口之外匯貨款時，可以抵付原應按平準會牌價結購之外匯，同時由該商另行提供結匯證明書，一併驗明後，方准抵付。以上辦法，據聯席會議發言人稱：即由中信局照辦，並由央行通知各指定銀行查照。</p>

<h3>米粉油糧昨又上漲</h3>
<p>食米重吿挺升，因錫市轉漲，銀根鬆濫，故人心復堅，市乃復甦。去化雖不多，供應亦更少。晨開後即吿步升，後市愈露堅俏。北市塲白粳開六百九十萬元，早薄稻及秈米各挺十萬元，特高粳漲二十萬，為七百二十萬元，南市塲各檔粳秈均升十萬元，白元·陰元一致挺高，以收市堅勢而言，實際挺升有二十萬元。昨日到貨南北二市塲共三千三百二十五石。</p>
<p>麵粉</p>
<p>初漲後回，終見微昂。老車粉最先為二百十萬，後緩步回低，為二百〇六萬元，兵船則以二百〇二萬收市，微秀萬元。紅蜂·建成亦稍漲。麩皮加四五萬元，小麥廠方吃價不增，以二百七十萬原盤開出。</p>
<p>雜糧</p>
<p>齊步挺升，黃豆漲二十萬，乍豆初市次貨三百三十五萬，最後高貨三百五十萬元。菉豆蠶豆一致升十萬，紅糧交易不多，新元麥連日下跌，昨亦轉漲二十萬。苞米北帮逢低力吸，回漲四十萬之多。赤豆亦挺四十萬，芝蔴客胃不多，高挺次定。生仁付款日期未解決，俱未開出</p>
<p>食油</p>
<p>廠方以原料價漲，開價甚高，加以銀根寬，進胃大，終以開價過高，反招致散戶傾吐，致收市下降。大有豆油晨為一千六百二十萬，後退為一千五百六十五萬收市，軋漲五六十萬元。吉桶生油為一千九百萬，小車蔴油同價，各漲五十萬。豆餅散戶在人心之驅動下，長字餅高達一百七十萬，收市退小二萬。</p>
<h3>上海區本月轉口粉　糧部準四十五萬袋</h3>

<h3>收兌東北流通券　每人限額五千萬</h3>
<p>關於東北流通劵收兌之事，中央銀行業已正式接獲財部之命令，國行特轉知各地分行，即日起按新定滙率十一元五角收兌。惟有相當限制，即每人兌換數額，以法幣五千萬元為限。至由東北滙兌，則以法幣二億元為限。逾此規定者，須向當地中央銀行申請。至滬國行因收兌伊始，刻尙未接獲市民之兌換。</p>
<h3>對實施外匯管理新辦法　央行與輸管會發表聲明</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕最近一部份輿論界，對於去年八月十八日，政府實施外滙管理辦法後與出口貿易之關係，及此次中央銀行與輸出入管理委員會，所發一三一通函之觀感與實際情况，頗有出入。中央銀行與輸出入管理委員會昨特共同　表　明，大意為：（一）自去年八月外滙平準基金委員會成立以來，採用機動滙率，對於推進出口，增加外滙收入，甚有成績。本年三四兩月出口外匯收入，均仍遠在去年七八兩月平均數字之上，故絕無壓抑出口之事實。</p>
<p>（二）自本年二月以後，中央銀行深知機動調整滙率為當前比較合理而有效之辦法，而使其不能發揮效能之種種障碍，必須統籌設法，因即開始研究若干種改善外滙辦法之方案，最近宣布之結匯證明書辦法，即為所提三種辦法之一。在統盤設法改善之先，暫時以一三一辦法為救濟措施，該項辦法，在採用之時，即為過渡性質，故於新結匯辦法正式施行之日，自當按照原來計劃，予以取消，固與人事之更動無關云。</p>
<h3>銀根鬆·人心俏　棉紗布繼續上漲　藍鳳細紗再升一千萬元</h3>
<p>昨日棉紗市况，因銀根鬆弛，人心看好，客路津粵等帮採辦續暢，大戶亦來扒吸。四十二支藍鳳細紗，晨開即升一千一百萬元，交易頗多。卒以三億一千四百萬元結束，比上日續漲一千萬元。其餘各支粗細紗，均較上日步升五六百萬至一千三四百萬元不等。</p>
<p>昨日棉布市况，以紗價步挺，客帮納意仍濃，十二磅龍頭細布，初開市盤即漲廿八萬元，嗣因本街同業及散戶爭進，步高至七百二十五萬成交，最高至廿九萬元。旋以同業獲利右售，市盤壓低至七百十五萬元。至十點後，因紡建懸牌，仍以中低檔細布開售，人心轉俏，龍頭布終以七百二十二萬元收盤，較上日再升卅二萬元。其他各檔細布，及粗布漂布色布士林布等，行情一致步漲一二十萬至四五十萬元不一。</p>
<h3>加強原棉管制　嚴格旅行領詥手續</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕紗管會前為加强原棉管制，防止商人私自買賣，高抬市價起見，特規定國內棉花運輸，應憑該會棉花運輸證。滬市棉花之移動，應憑棉花移動證，各辦法通飭實施以來，廠商輅守遵行固多，因不明手續，或且希圖便利。故意嘗試，伺機走私者亦所在恒有。該會以剏行初期，未欲據法嚴繩，現在為日漸久，事關統購，殊不容長任玩忽，昨特再剴切佈吿，凡到滬棉花，應一律赴該會請領移動證，始能搬至存儲廠棧，車站碼頭倉庫憑運輸證即可進棧，自此次佈吿之日起，如再故違，該會即依照規定處罰云。</p>
<h3>結匯證明書　工商界建議　設公開市場</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕結滙證明書之售價，昨日為每美元折合國幣三十六萬元，與牌價介計為八十三萬四千元，較之前日，又見降低。聞工商界人士對結滙證明書之轉　問題，頗為注意，為避免有力者之操縱起見，建議有關常局設立一公開市塲，承認結滙證書之市塲，協助賣買兩方之交易。又自結滙新辦法實施後，出口物資於數日內竟猛漲25%至40%，顯屬有人操　，聞輸管會對此極為注意。</p>
<h3>僑匯處理辦法　尚待詳細究</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕據悉：新結滙辦法實施後僑滙之處理，經僑滙小組　議通日商討後，原則上已決定對僑滙亦發給結滙證明書。惟僑滙收受地點大部份在兩廣，因地區之遼還，牽涉之技術問題甚多，當局決定對此進一步之研究。</p>
<h3>華股上落有限　統債成交活躍</h3>
<p>華股昨起仆竊忽，大戶行動詭秘，過程遂十分不定，人心不免徬徨，時露怯疲之象。中絲增資決定，却反跌至停限。</p>
<p>晨開時已見不支，永紗以二八六〇元登塲，被賣到二八三〇元，旋升為二九〇〇元，良以業外物價尙見穩健也。代辦費開原價，大戶明進暗出，跌至二七七五元低價。午收二七九〇元。較前收計　絲跌停後微回，與華豐美亞信和新光新華景福商務跌半成，餘均微挫。</p>
<p>後市永紗以二八四〇元登塲，國行差進不多，而回升至二八八〇元。此後即在了結聲中，賣到二七九五元，收市二八〇〇元。較晨收計永紗華豐閘北中絲榮豐統益小升，中法信和火柴勤興內衣永公平平，餘均微降。塲外各未上市股票仍以銀行股好半成為最俏。</p>
<p>昨上落更為有限，為期短去一天，銀根過剩，結果都呈小秀，甲種在七四元一二角間上落，乙種僅七四元八有成交而已。</p>
<p>公債</p>
<p>昨逐步步堅，雜牌成交活躍，統丙自二五萬九起，步升至二八萬一，而後轉盤。較前收計甲乙丙戊各升一萬四，統丁好起一萬六。</p>
<p>外股</p>
<p>昨業廣衆疲獨俏，廣港帮有納。怡紗晨開四四八萬起，步降至四三五萬左右收束。交易有限，結果較前收計英聯航業低半成，業廣獨漲成半，怡紗紙版鋼業怡　均吿小挫。</p>
<h3>行局差進　銀根仍鬆</h3>
<p>昨日本市銀根，仍在鬆弛狀態中。銀錢業票據交換中，國家行局少有差進，總額為三二〇四億。就中中央銀行差進一四二三億，中國銀行差進二六八五億，交通銀行差出一一二四億，農民銀行差出一二七億，中信局差進七六九億，郵滙局差出五三〇億，中央合作金庫差進二〇八億。商業行莊大交換差出二九四〇億，小交換差出二二二二億，外商銀行共計差進一九五八億。</p>
<h3>五月份出口外匯　共一千六百餘萬</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕輸管會頃發表，五月份出口外滙收入，共計一六，一〇一，一二一·三五美元，其中上海一地收入（一至廿九日）為一二，五九三，一〇五·二〇美元。外埠收入共為三，五○七，九一六·一五美元，其中包括合灣（一日至廿二日）一，六二九，一六六。八二美元，天津（二日至廿二日）九二九，七一四·九六美元，廣州（二日至十五日）五五一，七六五·二九美元，漢口（二日至廿二日）二〇一，七三五·六三元，靑島（二日至廿二日）一七一，〇〇四·九一美元，梧州（二日至八日）二四，五二八·五四美元。</p>

<p>新醫與新藥</p>
<h3>提倡「國產的西藥」</h3>
<p>— 梁俊青</p>
<p>我們醫師在偶然的集會裹往往聽見有人批評「國產西藥」的粗製濫造，貽誤病家，言下大有「成品低劣，不屑一顧」的樣子。其實這種錯誤的觀念是要不得的。如果任　　種似是而非的歪曲觀念繼續發展下去，那豈止是我國的西藥業永遠無抬頭的日子，而且從外滙方面來說，我們的國家每年在經濟方面眞不知要損失多少—</p>
<p>當然舶來的西藥多半都是經過了無數的專家　心竭慮的研究和臨床方面的實地試驗方始成品問世，所以在品質方面和成效方面來說，定是應該被我們所歡迎使用的。不過，我也得正告讀者諸君，舶來的西藥雖則是效用卓著容易獲得了我們民衆的信仰，可是其中粗製濫造而不成熟的藥品也不算少（其中尤以抗戰勝利後運來者為多）而且，西藥之中往往可以附帶有種種的副作用，假如處置不得其當，那末就容易為害病家。所以舶來的西藥也並非絕對的完善可靠，端賴於我們醫師在使用時的愼重選擇。至於「國產的西藥」呢，雖則在設備一和製造方面不無簡陋，然而其中的普通藥品其成效實在不在舶來品之下。例如每天使用最多的靜脈注射的葡萄糖劑，舶來品每管要在國幣六十萬元左右，而國產品則在十萬元內外。似此成效相同而售價相距如此之鉅，我們為着病家的經濟着想，為着國家在外滙方面的損失着想，難道不要提倡國產的西藥嗎—</p>
<p>而且當着這個民窮財盡的亂世，舶來的西藥因為外滙的關係售價一天一天的高漲，不單只敎我們窮苦的病家坐以待斃無法購買，即如中產之家亦難以羅掘。縱或變買借貸，勉力以赴，然而家產已空，來日何以為生？我常常心裹在想，何必說用什麼經濟侵略的政策去滅亡我們的國家，即如以舶來西藥一種而論，也已够使我們中國人被剝削至於血枯財盡了。有許多近視的國人以為他們替我們設立了許多醫院是由於存心慈善，救濟貧病（有引起小國家如瑞士的西藥商則更變本加厲，乾脆不去做什麼假仁假義的慈善事業，只曉得天天在漲價）其實那裹曉得這不渦是一種苦藥外層的糖衣呢。</p>
<p>筆者今年春問出席南京的全國醫師公會聯合大會曾受國產西藥商的聯席歡案。在宴會中有楊氏化學研究所所長楊樹勛博士的致詞，歷述抗戰期間民衆缺乏西藥的痛苦和國產西藥業發展的困難，並曾指出目前國際局勢的緊張和第三次世界大戰的可能。他希望我國人能够及時準備，切勿再蹈以前的覆轍。陳詞哀婉，語語沉痛。可惜人微言輕，無濟於事。大家都只顧目前的利益，又有誰去注意那些比較遠大的事情呢？</p>
<p>老實說，如果我們醫家和病家都能够注意到愛護「國產西藥」這一點，大家極力提倡使用，（起先從最普通使用的西藥中揀取其可靠的國產品，加以普遍的提倡使用），那末國產的西藥一定也可以一天一天的發達起來，充實起來，完善起來。將來繼續發展下去，我們也許會有這麼一天，把國產的西藥暢銷到外國去呢！</p>
<p>天下無難事，只在有心人。」我謹此敬祝「國產的西藥」前途無量！</p>
<h3>編者的話</h3>
<p>這一期的稿十雖然都是倔於理論方面的東西，但是因為它所論到的都是與醫家及民衆有直接關係的事情，所以特別把它集　來發表在本期。希望續者們不至於感覺到太枯燥無味吧！</p>
<p>黃鳴駒博士是　學界的老前一輩，他和黃嗚龍博士是昆伸，蜚聲　學方面已經有數十年。</p>
<p>蘇會祥博士係早年留學德國漢堡的女醫師。本期她這一篇文一字雖然拉雜寫來，可是十足地充滿了正義感的氣息。我希望我們醫師界像她所說的多多在本位方面做工作，那末「種瓜得瓜，種豆得豆」結果終歸是好的。否則結果雖然未必是身敗名裂，而為人所共棄，自己永遠都覺得內疚了。</p>
<p>有許多讀者寫信來問病症，可是沒有附足郵資及地址。對於這種信件，我們當然不會答覆的。老實說，現在的醫師看一個門診要幾十萬元，現在要特地抽出時間去答覆千樣萬樣的問題，難道還好意思再敎他去貼奉郵資嗎。</p>
<p>下期將有一篇對於治療肺癆病非常重要的文字，請讀者們注意。謹此預吿。</p>
<h3>春曉樓診餘隨筆</h3>
<p>— 蘇曾祥</p>
<p>最近胡適之先生為我寫了一副小屛條，上書「種瓜得瓜，種豆得豆」。我覽得這兩句成語，不但表示着一種期望，也含有一種警惕。</p>
<p>就醫生而論，終歲　勤，除治病而外，復須研究如何防病；不以人命為兒戯，不以營利為目的，醫生種了善因，病人即有善果。</p>
<p>就病家而論，一切能聽醫生指示，能和醫生合作，知道護理重於藥物；對於空氣日光營養，能善為運用，不作無益之舉，那麼疾病使易於痊愈。此即病家種了善因，他自己得了善果，並使醫生得到成功。</p>
<p>再看社會一般情形，不論工商各業，如重利輕義，囤積居奇，粗製濫造，但求市面漲，不計民生苦；久而久之，社會經濟崩潰，小之影響個人信譽，大之貽誤國家前途。這是種了惡因，必有惡果。</p>
<p>此外處世之道，何獨不然，毀損人格，僥倖得志，一且被衆所棄，仍免不了身敗名裂。這也是種了惡因，必有惡果</p>
<p>炎夏將至，如隨意亂吃生冷汚穢的東西，不知節制，不求淸潔，因此發熱，腹瀉，霍亂，傷寒，疫癘等等疾病，隨之而至，小之傷身，大之殞命。這又同樣是種了惡因，必有惡果。</p>
<p>世上什麼事情，種瓜祗能得瓜，種豆祗能得豆，不是迷信，而是科學。身受高等敎育的人們，當有以自警！</p>
<h3>漫談藥學教育（上）</h3>
<p>— 黃鳴駒</p>
<p>抗戰勝利，怱怱已兩年有餘，四强之一的光榮，不覺已漸次糢糊，處在這互相勾心鬥角地爭取物資，努力原子彈之應用的局勢之下，若再不把握時機，邁步前進從事科學的建設，不獨四强之一的名詞永遠消失，恐怕整個國家生存感到威脅，</p>
<p>利之後，努力建國的呼聲，無論在政府方面，或民衆方面，皆是甚　塵上。然而建國需要人才，我們的八才够用不够用呢？我們不看別的，且看過去兩年，僅僅收復區接收工作，已經就感覺到人才缺乏太多，又如何談建國呢？所以要講建國，需要科學，要科學發達，必須羅致人才，人才不足，就得要造就，這是當前牢不可破的定論，必須努力以赴。</p>
<p>科學範圍很廣，要他前進，必需全面前進，絕不可以單獨一方面，或是偏　於一方面，就可希望他成功的。例如民國初年，感覺自然科學太差，政府派遣人員留學，便偏重於自然科學。嗣後感覺政治混亂，無法治理，於是以後派遣人員出國留學，偏重於政治經濟的學門。其結果科學落後，一蹶不振，於是到目前的趨勢，又偏重於自然科學，其實此種措施，皆有點欠缺，要知世界大勢無論何種事業，都包含科學，互相配合，須同時並進，絕不可偏廢。</p>
<p>我們就藥學敎育而言，數十年以來，可以說是毫無建樹，雖然有少數人大聲疾呼，建立藥學敎育，終竟反應亳無，在抗戰前，我們藥學落伍，一般看起來，亳無所覺，因為歐美各國，有不斷地發明新藥，價値低廉，效用神速，源源傾銷國內，我們取用便利，絕不感覺到將來會有痛苦發生。所謂工商業凋敝，國有漏巵，這是　也不會看到，誰也不會想到，縱然有少數人看到想到，大聲急呼，終無效用，數十年來，就在這種因循局面中過去。</p>
<p>抗戰以後，海口封鎖，新藥來源斷絕，藥荒嚴重達到極點，西藥的價値，自然狂漲起來，民衆即使有力就醫，無力購藥，只有坐以待斃一法。這種情形之下，犧牲性命的，我們雖然沒有統計，恐怕為數一定不小。在抗戰期中，可以說直接受到藥物不能自給自足，藥學落伍的切膚痛苦，大家都應該感覺到，理應從速發展藥學敎育，造就高深藥學人才，以求藥物的自給自足。可是數年來，藥荒只管嚴重，大家奔走呼號，亦祗在藥荒的如何救濟，從未談到藥學人才缺乏的補救，藥學敎育退後的根本問題，而主持藥學敎育者，又似乎奄無所聞，毫無所感。細按此種現象的所以發生，大率不外下列數點。</p>
<p>（一）醫藥不分</p>
<p>（二）統系混亂</p>
<p>（三）觀點錯誤</p>
<p>關於第一點，因為我國自古以來，醫與　就不分，知醫的就該知藥。知藥的就能行醫，直到現在，大家仍是有此種觀念，因此認為藥學敎育，亦係醫學人士的責任，其實醫藥兩科，係兩種逈然不同的東西，在古時候醫生調配藥物，藥師能辦到方脈，此種現象，歐洲未開化前，也都如此，到了後來科學發達，醫藥界限，不容不分，因為醫學係研究病理，治療的學門，其基本科學屬重要的，如解剖學，病理學，生理學；藥學係研究藥物的製造，構造，化騐的學門，從其基本科屬重要的，如化學，植物學，生藥學，分析等，從其基本科學科目看來，可以知道這兩種是逈然不同的科學，絕不能混為一談，醫與藥唯一的密切關係，不過因製出的藥物須醫生試用，然絕不能因為要他試用，就將一切問題都需責成醫生的手，一切敎育問題，也須由其負責，其錯誤實在可笑，譬如習農學者，種出許多農作物，呌廚師試用，以辨別其優劣，但不能就說廚師就懂得農作物的種植方法，甚至呌他們管理農學事業，其錯誤與不能辨別醫藥之區分正自相同。當然，醫生對於藥物性質，藥理，都須有深切的研究，然而這都是藥的應用方面，而幷非製造方面，所以醫即是藥，藥即是醫的錯誤觀念，實為藥學敎育不被人所重視，不能長足發展的癥結所在。（朱完）</p>

<p>自由談</p>
<h3>民主與法治</h3>
<p>— 靖文</p>
<p>談民主似乎是時下最流行的事情，政論刋物固然多的是這類文章，就是一般性的綜合刊物甚或文藝刊物，也總有一二關於民主問題的文章點綴其間。這在行憲伊始的我國，應該說是當然的現象，而且是一種好現象。我們不但不嫌其多，尙覺其太少。試想國大時期的代表諸公猶須人手一册「民權初步」，也足見民主知識之在我國，離普遍深入的地步尙遠。</p>
<p>這自然是因為民主的實行，必須與民智取得平行發展。民可使由之不可使知之，是專制時代閉塞民智的一種手段，所以初步的民主，必須從怎樣「使知之」着手。因為民主說來雖然千緒萬端，而槪括言之，則即是人人能行使其自由意志之謂。談民主而所以必然與自由一語相聯緊者，也就是道個道理。</p>
<p>然而行使自由意志，是必須以一定定的民智程度為相對條件的。因為自由意志而沒有適當的判斷力，往往會成為一種危險的東西。試想這個世界上若人人一任其自以為是自由意志而行動，又將樊成怎樣的一個局面？所以民主的國家，必須嚴格實施法治；法治在某種程度上，應該說是對個別自由意志的約束，但實際上人人皆知唯有嚴格的法治，才眞正是自由與民主的可靠保陣。所謂法治者，就是一國民智的程度，已能權衡以犧牲個人一部份的自由，換取全體社會成員的自由之謂。</p>
<p>三民主義中曾經批評過我國人民有散沙式的自由，却缺少水泥凝固的耐力，這是因為我們所有的自由太散漫了。西文中的「大打出手」一語，直譯起來就是大家自由行動（free　for　all）。關於這一類的自由，我們最近幾成司空見慣，如打電車，打戯院，以及學生集團的對打等等，是都可歸納於這種自由的。但反之則無非證明我們的民智程度，實尙遠不能談法治。</p>
<p>許多不滿現狀的人，認為我們今天談不到甚麼法治，誰有勢力，誰有錢，誰便站在「治」的上風，法建好像就是為這輩人設立的屛障。社會沒有公理，人間沒有正義，還能談甚麼法治？據報載常州地方的戯院因在「褚鳳娣慘死案」一劇中的法庭塲面上，將法庭上的「國以法治」匾額改為「國以幣治」，致遭禁演，但也足證目前人心對於法治是怎樣的失望了。</p>
<p>社會現象使人失望，自然不容否認。不過消極的識諷以至絕望，都無助於社會風氣的轉移。以為法治不可為，守法無異是束縛自己，這祗能說是偏激之見。所誚民主精神，即是要求人人能有爭取法治的精神，也就是要人去循合法的途徑爭取自由與保障。民主革命所以不同於暴力革命，就是前者講求法與理的程序，它的過程是漸進的；而後者的結果則往往是以暴易暴。</p>
<p>在一個不合理的社會下，欲求實現法治，雖然是一個難題，但明知其不可為而偏欲為之，此種精神才眞正是為民主奮鬥的精神。前一時期某律師曾因郵局未經立法院通過加價，而對郵局追加欠資的行為提起控訴。這在當時僅是幾千塊錢的小事，且某律師亦明知加價旣經行政當局通過，雖未經合法程序，但事已不可為，而偏欲為之，這就是爭取法治的民主行動。雖然這行動的結果是失敗的，然其精神的影響則頗可貴。</p>
<p>法治的意義雖不在鼓勵人們興訟，但為保障個人或社會的利益，人人應當知道怎樣去利用法律的途徑以伸張正義，反之，人人亦應以約制個別的自由意志與行動，以盡對社會的責任。現在雖巳行憲，惟離開實現眞正的民主，還有很長的一段路。這段路能否順利通過，就得看我們的民智程度是否能有區別個人自由與社會成員自由的判斷力，也即是在於人人能否尊重法治的精神。我不贊成以暴易暴式的所謂民主，同時也反對散沙式的自由，而相信唯有建立在法洽基礎上的民主，才是眞正的民主主義。</p>
<h3>破除迷信</h3>
<p>— 寄漠</p>
<p>有許多人，常常因為晚上做了亞夢，例如身體陷在泥淖內，在黑晴中摸索，追趕火車而始終不能乘上；或是在醒着的時候，失手砸破碗盞，茶杯，或鏡子，而惴惴不能自安。我最近才知道甚至在大出喪中看不到棺材，也是發生小不幸的預兆。</p>
<p>自從歐化東漸以來，帶來了不少科學的新智識，但是同時也傳入若干新迷信，買戯票買到一張十三號的對號券，或是在路上因為行人擁擠，不得不在一架梯子下穿過，多少使人在心上掠過一陣不愉快的感覺。人生途中的煩惱與緊張生活，己經使人够受，平添了這許多迷信，心理上更備受牽制。</p>
<p>我們在物質享受上的缺憾，果然不惜用種種方法補償，我們在精神生活上的束縛，也應設法解除。據說當代美國小說家辛克萊·劉易士（是得過諾貝爾獎金四萬餘元的那一位，不是寫石炭王，波士頓等書的烏潑登·辛克萊），也是一個破除迷信的激烈份子。某次嘗應某佈道會之邀，出席致詞，他在痛斥謠傳某思想自由份子為上帝殛斃的無稽以後，大聲疾呼道：「我自己願意獻身做試驗品，請上帝在十分鐘內將我處死—」一時聽佈道者大譁，紛紛離座而去。</p>
<p>本來，迷信的可畏處，在使人心境沮喪，感於某種預兆，對未來發生一種恐懼心理。它壅塞健全的思考與理解力，是任何人向前謀進取的絆脚石。我曾經目睹過一個建築師設計某工程竣事後，執筆作書時忽然手指顫動，遲疑不決，終於放棄他的工程計劃，連帶展緩了他一舉成名的日期</p>
<p>論理，如果有不辛的預兆，就眞有發生不幸事件的可能，那末，眞正的災禍或意外事件光臨之前，似乎也必須要先有朕兆，方才說得通。記得有一年歲尾，筆者自蘇州搭京滬車來滬，在火車駛進上海站時，與另一火車頭相撞，一時死傷枕藉。筆者在列車的末後幾節內，雖受震動，幸未受傷。然而在這失事的那一天，氣候異常晴朗，車中的人也談笑風生，一直到駛進車站的最後幾分鐘內，並無一絲象徵不幸的最微細的痕跡。</p>
<h3>天災？</h3>
<p>— 海燕</p>
<p>不久前重慶有一次大火，延燒五小時，而由星星到燎原不過十多分鐘。</p>
<p>重慶最不易救火，往往離馬路一遠，轉兩個灣，石級坡度太陡，水龍之力不易達，有些路則不然，水龍頃刻即至，然而消防人員竟束手無策，萬人隔岸而觀，祗有　首的份兒。</p>
<p>原因嗎？原因是沒有自來水，水能帶　　地，消防只有乾　急。於是百多間屋子眼看成了灰　。</p>
<p>火燒房子，宿命的中國人一向稱為「天災」，火中宿烏因迷路盤旋，映着火光，幻為金翼，則被稱為「火老鴉」，是祝融老爺派來主持降災的，被焚之後，還要打火醮酬神，否則還要再來肆虐，總之，在看火燒的途人，大抵異口同聲咨嗟歎息的是「天意」！</p>
<p>果眞是天意嗎？沒有自來水而巳。</p>
<p>中國的科學落後，一切公用防災的設備不够，是無法可施的。但在重慶，則有幾個觀火的空軍說：「假如有命令呌我們駕兩架飛機投下點沙來，馬上便蓋熄了，但是沒有命令，便無可如何。」</p>
<p>水災，也不算小事，即使是出動飛機救災，也不算小題大做的浪費呀，因為畢竟關係着三千人的生命財產。</p>
<p>可是，休說飛機，　是最普通最方便自來水也沒法利用，自來水之沒有，是由於倫水打傷了人，或者其他原因呢？不必深究。要而言之，沒有儘量利用的設備是無可掩飾的事實。</p>
<p>中國人民的命運老是把握在天老爺火老鴉手上，這說明我們還停滯在愚蠢落後的時代，與庚子前後沒有什麼大的不同。</p>
<p>我們不必談什麼新的科學的建設，能够順利地得到二十年前的自來水設備，已經是無上之福了。</p>
<h3>錢君匋　徐菊庵　金石書　畫展序</h3>
<p>— 豐子愷</p>
<p>君匋菊庵將於六月四日起在中國國貨公司開金石書畫展。我到上海看梅蘭芳劇時，君匋吿我此消息，並屬為序。近來世問遍地烽烟，使我對於象徵和平幸福的「藝術」，彌覺可親。我專誠來君梅劇，而又聞此消息，似覺錦上添花。我樂為作序。</p>
<p>君匋本來是圖案專家，其所設計，別出心裁。抗戰八年中，理頭於金石研究，這就使他的才技超越岡案，而向書畫發展。至今，金石，書，畫，平均進步，可稱「三絕」。中國古有「書畫同源」之說。其實此說未全。應說「金石書畫同源」，三位一體。而論其次第，則金石為老大哥，書為二兄，畫為三弟。吳昌碩之徒吿我：吳昌碩晚年自言：「人謂我善畫，實則書勝於畫；人謂我善書，實於金石更勝於書。」此言誠然！吳氏因精通金石，故能書；因精通書法，故能畫。金石書畫三位一體，而金石在三位由為老大哥，於此蓋可確信。今君匋之學，由金石入門，源源本本，由上而下，由根而末，由內而外，由深而淺，無怪其書法與畫道之進步，一日千里，而終於三才並茂也。</p>
<p>菊庵與君匋為同風美術家，論君匋者，不妨同論菊庵。而我獨愛其古裝仕女，師費曉樓，而靑出於藍。體貌之嫵媚，綫條之精秀，布局之妥帖，令人愛殺！我自己素不描古裝人物。半為習慣，半為討嫌一般古裝人物畫的難看：女的身體往往不合生理，各部畸形發展，或竟殘廢。男的我討嫌他像道士。菊庵不畫「道士」而專畫女像，而其所畫女體又均合於解剖，相貌姣好，體態輕盈，有似「天女散花」，「洛神」中的梅蘭芳。因此使我愛殺。君匋的作品我已有得多了，菊庵的我還沒有求得。幾時我要向他討一幅古裝美女。掛在室中，彷彿天天看見梅博士了。這篇不像序言，就算序言吧。（三十七年五月十二日於杭州作。）</p>
<h3>錢君甸治印</h3>
<h3>健忘</h3>
<p>— 梅白</p>
<p>有一天，名女星海蒂。拉瑪和名作家海區脫因事同去訪問好萊塢影業鉅子斯屈隆堡。他們按照了約定的時刻，準時前往，一按門鈴，斯屈隆堡親自出來開門，請他們裏面坐。他說還有一些事情未了，請這兩位客人先少坐片刻，他馬上回來，說完就忍忽上樓而去。</p>
<p>這兩位客人一連等了一個鐘頭，竟然還不見主人下來。海區脫輕輕對拉瑪小姐耳語道：一他恐怕上樓之後就忘了我們了，也許在睡午覺也說不定。我們還是重新來一下罷」</p>
<p>拉瑪小姐欣然答應。於是他們跑出門外，重新按一下電　。倒又是斯屈隆堡親自來開門，請他們裏面坐。海區脫先說道：「對不起，我們來遲了一點。一斯屈隆堡就懇切地說：「好說好說，我恭候你們二位好久了。」於是海蒂·拉瑪和海區脫就欣然和斯屈隆堡談起公事來—一句也沒有提到他們先已來過的話。</p>
<p>###</p>
<p>社會變態，異聞迭出。上星期天津有一樁奇事，是位法官的太太，把馬甲送到洗染公司去洗，後來發現衣角內縫之金錠，鑽飾，美鈔，寶物等。失去半數，公司不認賠，因而相吵成訟。此太太可稱眞實無比的「金裝玉裹」，其闊無倫。然奇妙處尙不在「闊」，而在「想入非非」。吾聞前年日僑貴婦遺回，抵其國土時，被盟軍搜獲衣帶縫角之金寶無數，得所挾者私，誠不得不仿漢獻帝「衣帶詔」之藏法，而此天津太太則何為乎？此不可思議者一也。舊例凡衣物交櫃代存或付店家整理，接收者必先問「衣兜裏有東西否」？物主或答以「無」，或自檢點一過，有即自己收去。但此指兜袋而言，若縫藏衣內之買物，則接收者無從問，物主亦不便明宣，此天津太太先則率然交付，後又公然言之，此不可思議者二也。三國漢獻帝之「衣帶詔」，係董承觀　時燈火爆落，燒燬帶之一角，因而發現內藏之血詔。此外有今古奇觀小說，滕大升斷家私一案，接受梅氏控訴，只以其故夫所遺畫軸呈上，縣尹看圖，不甚了然，恰巧茶役送茶，滴永濕其一角，發現內層有字，照燈細看，得見全篇分配家產的遺囑。即據以判斷完案（事詳小說原文，茲不複叙）。以上都是夾藏與透露秘密的故事。但所藏者秘密文件，非金珠實物也，此天津之財貨旣非走私，何須弄此玄虛？殊不可解。或曰，惟其不可解，所以成為現代之新聞，因而今不可解的怪事太多……</p>
<p>一言未畢，又見報載湘籍國代携眷回經漢口，太太被竊皮包，失去金條三，金碗一，金飾美鈔約共値四五百億之巨。太太且已知此小竊乃自南京跟蹤而至者，則所可詫，亦不在「闊」而在事跡之離奇矣。於此益嘆古文「漫藏誨盜」用字之妙，曰「漫」曰「誨」，旣簡鍊又深刻，舊文學其可非乎？</p>

        <h1>1948.06.04</h1>
<h3>The Executive Yuan Will Hold a Temporary Meeting Today to Discuss the Drafting of Policy Guidelines, Focusing on Policy Priorities</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 3rd] The policy guidelines of the new Executive Yuan will focus on earnestly implementing the constitution, careful planning, improving work efficiency, and promoting a spirit of reform. Following preliminary discussions at the first meeting the previous day, it has been decided that a temporary meeting will be held again on the 4th to further discuss the matter. Written opinions from various ministries had been successively submitted to the Executive Yuan by the 3rd, and the Yuan is working overnight to collect and organize them. At the temporary meeting, Weng Wenhao will provide explanations based on the collected opinions, and will present several key points from the opinions of various ministries for discussion, before drafting the guidelines. According to reliable sources, these guidelines will differ from past approaches, eschewing itemized lists in favor of focusing on policy priorities.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 3rd] With the convocation of the Constitutional Control Yuan imminent, the Min and Qing parties have stalled on joining the cabinet and participating in the Control Yuan due to the unresolved issue of legislators. According to reliable sources, the election and formation of the Control Yuan members have been able to meet the original hopes of both parties, namely, that one member from the Youth Party and one from the Democratic Socialist Party be included among the ten. Therefore, the Kuomintang side earnestly hopes that the two parties will not insist on a complete resolution of the legislator issue before participating, and that the Control Yuan members from both parties can report for duty immediately. The Executive Yuan will also handle matters in accordance with the opinions of both parties. Although the Democratic Socialist Party has firmly stated that it will not participate in the Executive Yuan, the quota for political appointees will still be reserved, and it has been announced that Jiang Yuntian of the Democratic Socialist Party will serve as an advisor to the Executive Yuan. Zhang Junmai had previously stated that although the Democratic Socialist Party would not participate in the government, it would still adopt the same goals as the government and cooperate as an opposition party. Therefore, although they are not participating in the central government, they will continue to participate in local governments. Currently, the Ministers of Agriculture and Forestry and Industry and Commerce, who are headed by the Youth Party, have not reported to their ministries to work. In order to prevent delays in ministerial affairs, the Executive Yuan is considering a method of having other cabinet members temporarily serve concurrently. It is rumored that one of these two ministries will be concurrently headed by the Premier, and the other by another minister.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 3rd] Li Dang, Permanent Secretary of the Ministry of Finance, firmly requested to resign, but after Wang Yunwu earnestly persuaded him to stay, he has now, like Xu Baiyuan, dispelled his intention to resign. Both Deputy Ministers of Finance have decided to continue in their old posts. The rumor that Pan Xulun would become the Deputy Minister of Finance is now a thing of the past. Furthermore, Wang Yunwu has rescheduled his arrival at the ministry to the morning of the 5th.</p>
<h3>The Legislative Yuan Holds its Seventh Meeting; The Budget Committee Will Propose a Temporary Motion to Request the Executive Yuan to Expedite the Preparation of the Budget for the Second Half of the Year</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 3rd] The seventh meeting of the first session of the Legislative Yuan is scheduled to be held on the 4th to discuss the unfinished cases from the previous meeting.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 3rd] The Budget Committee of the Legislative Yuan convened a meeting on the morning of the 3rd, chaired by Yin Shuxian. It was resolved to propose a temporary motion at the plenary session on the 4th, requesting the Executive Yuan to expedite the preparation of the national general budget for the second half of this year and submit it to the Legislative Yuan before the 15th, so that it can be reviewed and decided before the adjournment at the end of the month. In addition, there was a discussion on the review techniques. In addition to dividing it into two major categories based on revenue and expenditure, the revenue section will be divided into three groups for review: (1) taxes, (2) debt, and (3) government assets. The expenditure section will be divided into several groups according to the agencies listed in the budget proposal. The coordination of policies and budgets will be reviewed both by group and comprehensively. The Directorate General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics, the Ministry of Audit, and other Yuan, ministries, and commissions may be invited at any time for consultation.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 3rd] Various committees of the Legislative Yuan are actively preparing to start their work. In addition to holding separate meetings to discuss their own grouping and technical issues such as linking with administrative agencies, the 21-member group meeting of the joint conference of conveners of various committees also conducted a comprehensive study.</p>
<h3>Stipends for Legislators Determined in Principle</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 3rd] The necessary living expenses of legislators will follow the stipend system of parliamentarians in countries such as the United Kingdom and the United States, and a certain amount of public funds will also be determined. This principle was decided by the 21-member group meeting formed by the joint conference of conveners of various committees of the Legislative Yuan. The group meeting was held at 3:00 PM on the 3rd in the East Hall on the second floor of the National Assembly Hall, chaired by Dai Xiujun. After carefully weighing the various proposals from the joint conference of conveners on the 2nd, and taking into account the objective conditions of national poverty and popular hardship, a rational discussion was conducted. Proposals for cars and Western-style houses were rarely mentioned, and the issue of transportation expenses was temporarily set aside. The issue of personnel was also resolved due to factual difficulties. It was decided that the Secretariat would designate several secretaries to be responsible for assisting each committee member in drafting proposals, without the need for each committee member to employ a clerk. As for the most important issue of public funds, the salary required for living expenses will be named stipend, and the amount will be determined after discussion by the plenary session. However, the majority opinion in the group meeting advocated that it should be slightly higher than the monthly salary of 680 yuan for a first-class official during the Tutelage period, in order to distinguish it from ordinary civil servants. However, in order to avoid criticism, they did not dare to request the treatment of a specially appointed official with a monthly salary of 800 yuan. As for the office expenses, including travel expenses for attending meetings and returning home, it will be named public funds, and the amount has not been determined. It is understood that the hope of the various committee members is that the sum of the stipend and public funds should be at least between 8,000 and 10,000 yuan per year. According to the Secretariat, the group meeting also expressed its intention to strive for improved treatment for public education personnel.</p>
<h3>Moral Re-Armament Assembly Opens; Chen Lifu Attends and Speaks</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, San Francisco, 2nd] Chen Lifu, Vice President of our Legislative Yuan, arrived in Los Angeles today to attend the World Moral Re-Armament Assembly held at the Hollywood Bowl tonight. Accompanying him, in addition to Mrs. Chen, were Hu Jianzhong, Chen Shifu, Luo Shishi, and Professor Allen of Yangon University of Political Science. Chen is scheduled to deliver a speech to the assembly on the 3rd. The assembly opened today, coinciding with its tenth anniversary. The session is scheduled for two weeks, with approximately 150 delegates from 23 countries participating. The theme of the conference is how to resist the spread of communism through spiritual revival. Chen will stay in the United States for two or three months. During his time in the United States, he may visit Washington, D.C., his alma mater the University of Pittsburgh, and other universities.</p>
<h3>Tianjin Gold Control Bureau Limits the Transportation of Cash</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tianjin, 3rd] The trend of transporting cash from Pingjin to Shanghai, Guangzhou, and other places is very strong. According to the Tianjin Gold Control Bureau, a total of 80 billion yuan of cash was transported out of Tianjin between May 1st and 10th. After the Tianjin Economic Conference decided on the 10th to relax the scale of cash transportation, the amount of cash transported from the 11th to the 24th suddenly reached 610 billion yuan. In order to remedy the continuation of this situation, in addition to requesting the central government to quickly open the Shanghai exchange, the Gold Control Bureau has entrusted the Tianjin 18 Commercial Guilds with the handling of applications for cash transportation matters from the 24th, limiting the amount of cash transportation for June to 860 billion yuan.</p>
<h3>Luo Shen Visits Yesterday</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 3rd] Luo Shen, the newly appointed Soviet Ambassador to China, accompanied by Wu, a specialist from the Protocol Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, visited the Sun Yat-sen Mausoleum and laid flowers at 4:30 PM on the 3rd.</p>
<h3>Smugglers on the Sino-Australian Border Disappear</h3>
<p>[Our Guangzhou Correspondent, 3rd] According to customs officials, after the signing of the Sino-Australian agreement, the phenomenon of smugglers gathering on the Sino-Australian border has now changed. It is estimated that the goods smuggled from Macau into Guangdong have decreased by 60% compared to last month.</p>
<h3>Spellman Arrives in Nanjing; President Hosts Banquet Last Night</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 3rd] President Chiang hosted a banquet at his official residence at 8:30 PM on the 3rd in honor of Cardinal Spellman, Archbishop of New York, and Archbishop Bergan of Omaha, who arrived in Nanjing with him. It may be recalled that in the autumn of 1945, Spellman once visited the wartime capital and was a guest of President and Mrs. Chiang.</p>
<p>[News from our correspondent] Cardinal Spellman, Archbishop of the New York area, officiated a consecration ceremony for thirteen Chinese monks at the Xujiahui Cathedral starting at 6:30 AM yesterday, ordaining them as priests. The ceremony lasted until after 9:00 AM and was attended by as many as 3,000 people, creating a grand scene for a time. At 9:20 AM, Cardinal Spellman and his party of fourteen took a China National Aviation Corporation (CNAC) plane to Nanjing, arriving at 10:30 AM.</p>
<h3>Direct Nanjing-Hangzhou Bus Service Scheduled to Start on the 10th</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 3rd] In order to facilitate passengers, the First Transportation Department of the Directorate General of Highways of the Ministry of Transportation will start a direct express bus service from Nanjing to Hangzhou starting on the 10th. The bus will depart from the Nanjing Linsen Road Station at 7:00 AM every day, stopping only at Jurong, Tianwang Temple, Liyang, Yixing, Tangdu, Changxing, Wuxing, and Sanqiaobu stations along the way. It will arrive in Yixing for lunch at 12:40 PM and reach Hangzhou at 7:00 PM in the afternoon.</p>
<h3>100,000 Tons of Kailuan Coal Can Be Transported to the Northeast Immediately</h3>
<p>[Our Shenyang Correspondent, 3rd] Gao Xibing returned to Pan from Ping on the afternoon of the 3rd.

<h3>Two Organizations of Hui People in North China</h3>
<p>Training for Self-Defense to Cooperate with Overall Warfare</p>
<p>[Our Beiping Correspondent, 3rd] The Hui people in North China have two organizations to cooperate with the overall campaign against the communists: (1) The Hebei Hui People's Brigade, organized by Wu Guanyi and others, is starting training in Tongxian and other places in eastern Hebei, with approximately 1,000 people. (2) In Beiping, the North China Hui People's Pacification and Mobilization Self-Defense Committee was established by Grand Imam Zhang Yuwen and others. All young Hui people in the five provinces of North China must participate.</p>
<h3>The Battle on the Outskirts of Nanyang Has Reached Its Climax</h3>
<p>[Our Hankou Correspondent, 3rd] The fighting east of the Baihe River near Nanyang has become increasingly fierce in the past three days. The air force here has repeatedly dispatched planes to assist in the battle, bombing and strafing over 3,000 communist troops in Huangao and Caozhuang and other places. In addition, 500 communist troops were discovered six kilometers southeast of Nanyang and immediately shot down more than half of them. A unit of a certain division of the National Army near Nanyang has broken through the encirclement, but the communists are constantly reinforcing their attacks, and the battle situation remains very heavy.</p>
<p>[Our Hankou Correspondent, 3rd] The center of gravity of the war in Central China has shifted to the outskirts of Nanyang, and the decisive battle of the main forces has reached a fever pitch. At 12:00 AM on the 1st, Chen Yi, Liu Bocheng, Chen Geng, Kong Congzhou and other communist forces, totaling approximately 100,000 troops, launched a fierce attack in three routes towards the Minghuang National Army positions ten miles south of Tongsupo (thirty miles east of Nanyang). The surrounding seventy or eighty villages have all been occupied by the communists. Although the National Army was outnumbered, it still fought valiantly. The powerful air force also cooperated with the ground troops in the battle. After fourteen hours of fierce fighting, the battle reached its climax at 2:00 PM on the 2nd. The National Army counterattack troops and the National Army from Nanyang rushed to support from three routes. After three hours of intense fighting, the National Army launched an attack from both inside and outside, and finally defeated the communist troops. At 9:00 PM in the evening, the communist troops stubbornly attacked again. The National Army used dense artillery fire to continuously bombard them, and the communist forces were slightly frustrated. The battle is currently ongoing. In addition, the main force of Chen Yi's 38th Column is still in the northeast of Xiping. The rumor that the communist troops have joined the Nanyang battle is not accurate.</p>
<p>[Our Hankou Correspondent, 3rd] The elite troops of our southern reinforcement army arrived in Xiping on the 2nd and will advance westward at full speed to intercept the flanks of the communist troops. The main force of the 38th Column, which failed to attack Queshan, has fled to the northeast of Biyang, attempting to echo the communist troops in Qi Gang and Minghuang from east to west.</p>
<h3>The National Government's Control Yuan Concludes; New Control Yuan Members to Exchange Views on Gathering Today</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 3rd] The National Government's Control Yuan held its last meeting at 9:00 AM on the 3rd to mark its conclusion, as the Control Yuan under the Constitution is scheduled to convene on the 5th. More than forty Control Yuan members attended, with President Yu Youren presiding and delivering a speech. He briefly stated that the Control Yuan had been fighting hard for more than a decade. In particular, during the War of Resistance, the Yuan's site was located in Jingangpo in Chongqing, and the two characters "Jingang" (Vajra) were like a portrayal of our members. Each member was indeed as strong and firm as a Vajra. Our efforts over the past decade have finally established a foundation and completed the mission, which is truly gratifying. Afterwards, the Secretariat reported several points regarding the conclusion of work: (1) In accordance with Article 3 of the Law on the Conclusion of Political Tutelage, the original statutory powers of this Yuan should cease on the day the first Control Yuan generated in accordance with the Constitution convenes. The President has ordered the Control Yuan under the Constitution to convene on the 5th, and this Yuan should conclude on the 4th. (2) The President's Office has agreed in principle to the proposal to issue severance pay. (3) Those who have served as Control Yuan members for more than seven years will each receive a bonus of one month's salary. The meeting adjourned after the report was completed.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 3rd] More Control Yuan members under the Constitution reported for duty. Nine more people, including Zhang Daizhen and Tao Baichuan, reported on the 3rd, bringing the total to ninety-eight. The Control Yuan members who have reported will have lunch at the International Social Club at noon on the 4th and hold a discussion to exchange views on the first gathering. The Preparatory Office of the Control Yuan under the Constitution is scheduled to hold a press conference at 4:00 PM on the 4th to report on the preparatory work.</p>
<h3>Reasonable Adjustment of the Powers of the Minister of National Defense and the Chief of General Staff; He Yingqin Officially Assumes Office Yesterday</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 3rd] The division of powers between the Minister of National Defense and the Chief of General Staff had some unreasonable aspects in the past. With the approval of President Chiang, it has been reasonably adjusted. All matters pertaining to military orders, such as troop deployment and combat command, are the responsibility of the Chief of General Staff, who can also directly receive the President's command. All matters pertaining to military administration, such as equipment and supplies, are the responsibility of the Minister of National Defense. Regarding this matter, President Chiang gave instructions on the basic principles of the Ministry of National Defense on May 29, stating: "The Chief of General Staff shall carry out military orders on the orders of the President, and military administration matters on the orders of the Minister, or on the Minister's instructions." This instruction and adjustment were publicly reported to all levels of officers in the Ministry of National Defense by He Yingqin when he assumed office on the morning of the 3rd.</p>
<h3>Commander-in-Chief of the Communist Suppression in Central China, Bai Chongxi, is About to Take Office</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 3rd] He Yingqin, the newly appointed Minister of National Defense, assumed office at 10:00 AM on the 3rd and presided over the monthly meeting of the Ministry of National Defense. Former Minister Bai Chongxi first reported that he regretted having made no achievements during his two years in charge of the Ministry of National Defense. He believed that his old superior Minister He would definitely be able to remedy the shortcomings of the past and complete the mission of suppressing the rebellion and building the nation. Bai also described his personal duties, saying that the Strategic Advisory Committee is the President's strategic advisory body, and the responsibility for suppressing the communists in Central China is also very important. In the future, in order to achieve success in suppressing the communists in Central China, it is necessary to implement the Principle of People's Livelihood and implement the overall warfare plan for Central China. He will soon take office and hopes that everyone will continue to work under the leadership of Minister He. He Yingqin then delivered a speech, humbly stating that he had been engaged in military work for thirty-two years and had long planned to retire. However, President Chiang and Premier Weng insisted on inviting him to take on this position, and he could not refuse, so he had to reluctantly accept. He believed that the position of Minister of National Defense should be held by a civilian, based on his personal observations in the United States. This system is to control the military with politics, so as to avoid falling into the path of military intervention in politics. He felt that it was inconsistent with this system for a military man to head national defense, and hoped that a civilian would be appointed in the future.</p>
<h3>He Yingqin Encourages his Colleagues to Devote Themselves to Serving the Country</h3>
<p>He Yingqin also mentioned the simple style of military leaders in various countries, where it is common to see senior officers going to the market to buy vegetables, which should be emulated. He also pointed out that the fact that soldiers in various countries are dedicated to military affairs and do not interfere in politics should also be used as a lesson. Soldiers belong entirely to the country. Article 138 of the Constitution stipulates that the national army, navy, and air force must be outside of personal, regional, and party affiliations, and be loyal to the country and love the people. Therefore, we should not have any factions or any small organizations, and should devote ourselves to serving the country. Regarding the work of the Ministry of National Defense in the future, He Yingqin pointed out that special attention should be paid to the lives of officers and soldiers in order to improve morale, and attention should be paid to the clothing of soldiers as soon as possible. Finally, he stated that the selection of personnel should be based on talent, and hoped that everyone would unite sincerely, overcome difficulties together, and complete the mission of suppressing the rebellion and building the nation.</p>
<p>After He Yingqin's speech, Chief of General Staff Gu Zhutong also made a brief speech, saying that there are currently two kinds of mentality among the general public, one is pessimistic and the other is negative, both of which are undesirable. In fact, some of our troops are indeed not as good as the communist troops, but there are also many cases where the communist troops flee when they encounter the National Army. Therefore, if the National Army generals can command and use them properly, suppressing the communists will definitely be easier to accomplish. The meeting adjourned at around 11:00 AM, and He Yingqin immediately went to the Minister's office to handle official business. All the officers had lunch together at noon to bid farewell to the old and welcome the new.</p>

<h3>US Government's Proposed Aid to China Plan Passed by the House Appropriations Committee; Utilization Period Extended to Fifteen Months</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 3rd] The US House Appropriations Committee passed the US government's requested $463 million aid to China plan on the 3rd, without making any changes to the original text. However, in its report, the committee requested that the US agencies implementing this fund exercise very strict control. The committee also extended the utilization period of the aid to China fund and other Economic Cooperation Administration funds from twelve months to fifteen months.</p>
<p>The aid funds to China passed by the Appropriations Committee stipulate that $125 million can be used freely by the Chinese government. Of the remaining $338 million, $60 million will be used for reconstruction projects. The remaining $278 million will be used to purchase: $85 million for rice and wheat, $72.5 million for cotton, $65 million for petroleum and petroleum products, $24 million for fertilizer, $10 million for tobacco, $20 million for replacement items for existing capital equipment, and $1.5 million for administrative expenses. According to US officials, the $72.5 million worth of cotton designated for China will be handled by privately owned American cotton import companies in Shanghai.</p>
<p>According to Cleveland, the head of the Economic Cooperation Administration's aid to China section, the purchasing procedures for the aid to China plan are divided into three categories: (1) The rice and wheat section will be handled and shipped to China by the US government. (2) For the cotton section, the Economic Cooperation Administration will issue letters of credit to American banks, ordering them to advance the purchase funds handled by private institutions. (3) After the Chinese and American governments reach an agreement on the types of goods that can be purchased freely by the Chinese government, the US government will pay for the goods purchased by the Chinese government in the future.</p>
<p>During the presentation, Economic Cooperation Administration officials told the committee that they plan to establish an office in China with 147 personnel, of which 25 will be Chinese personnel and the rest will be Americans. A total of 36 people in Washington handle the aid to China plan. Cleveland, head of the Economic Cooperation Administration's aid to China section, stated during the committee presentation that most of the wheat and flour in the aid to China plan will be transported to Beiping and Tianjin, and possibly also to Qingdao. Most of the rice will be transported to Shanghai, Guangdong, and Nanjing "and possibly also to some smaller cities in the south."</p>
<p>The minutes of the committee's meeting revealed that the American Chamber of Commerce in Shanghai's opinion on the aid to China plan stated that the aid to China plan "is definitely a matter of urgent importance," but requires strict control to ensure that the people actually benefit. The opinion also called for the abolition of commercial monopolies run by the Chinese government. The American Chamber of Commerce requested that the United States insist on a condition for aid to China, that "China should abide by international customs on the issue of inland waterway transportation." The opinion stated, "The abnormal restrictions imposed on foreign ships for the benefit of small private groups in China have greatly reduced traffic volume and increased water freight rates."</p>
<h3>Continued Contention for Da Wen Kou; Major Battle Brewing Around Yanzhou; Shangqiu-Dangshan Road Opens, National Army Convenes</h3>
<p>[Our JINAN Correspondent, 3rd] The battle for the city streets of Da Wen Kou and the bridgehead Wei Jia Zhuang on its northern end continues. The battle, which erupted on the afternoon of the 31st, has entered its fourth day. The defending army, with a force of one regiment, is enduring hardship against the enemy bandits’ 13th Column, one division, and the Xin 2nd and Xin 7th Regiments. Furthermore, the Da Xiao Wen River Bridge and the Yang River Bridge south of Tai'an are major bridges on the Jinpu Railway, second only to the Yellow River Railway Bridge. Construction began at the end of January, taking four months to complete. Originally scheduled for a formal trial run on June 1st, it was unfortunately destroyed by the Communist bandits due to the outbreak of war. According to the Railway Bureau, even if the Yanzhou-Jining section is reopened, the bridge engineering is so extensive that it will be impossible to repair it for military traffic within three to four months.</p>
<p>[Our JINAN Correspondent, 3rd] From 9 PM on the night of the 2nd, the bandit's 7th Column harassed the area near Wan De, maneuvering along both sides of the Jinpu Railway north of Jieshou. Fierce fighting lasted until 4 AM on the 3rd, when they were repelled. In order to adopt mobile warfare tactics, the National Army shifted its main force to the area near Qing Yang Shu between Zhang Xia and Wan De to continue fighting the bandits. The western section of the Jiaoji Railway outside Jinan has been relatively calm for the past few days.</p>
<p>[Our JINAN Correspondent, 3rd] A major battle is still brewing around Yanzhou. The Chen bandits, Liu bandits, and other seven columns gathered between Juye and Jiaxiang, as well as the Xin 11th Column south of Jiaxiang, were actively deploying and moving on the 2nd and 3rd. One of the columns fled south through Juye on the 2nd. On the night of the 2nd, bandits forcibly conscripted over 20,000 civilians, who crossed the river from Hanxian to transport grain and ammunition to the south bank of the Yellow River.</p>
<p>[Our XUZHOU Correspondent, 3rd] The Chen bandits' 1st, 4th, and 6th Columns, which crossed the Yellow River to the west, are still lingering around Juye and Jiaxiang. The National Army west and north of Heze has engaged in fierce battles to block the bandits.</p>
<p>[Our XUZHOU Correspondent, 3rd] Our Yellow Sea Air Force mobilized its aircraft clusters all day on the 3rd to assist in the battles in various parts of western Shandong. The bandits who fiercely attacked Du Zhuang (ten kilometers northeast of Heze) were subjected to low-altitude bombing and strafing by our Air Force, destroying their fortifications in Da Lin Zhuang and Li Zhuang. Bombing and strafing was also conducted against bandit transport outside Da Wen Kou, and the bandit offensive has been suppressed.</p>
<p>[Our XUZHOU Correspondent, 3rd] The National Army in Sishui, central Shandong, voluntarily withdrew yesterday. Fierce fighting continues in Da Wen Kou.</p>

<h3>Rebuilding Chinese Agriculture!</h3>
<p>The eleven members of the China Economic Survey Team have been announced by Hoffman, Director of the Economic Cooperation Administration, and will travel east with Putnam, head of the ECA mission in China, on a special plane on the 5th, expected to arrive in Shanghai on the 7th. Their mission is to investigate the Chinese economic situation and study the construction projects to be carried out in China under the $338 million aid plan. In addition to restoring essential transportation equipment, developing fuel and power output industries, exploiting mineral resources, and improving port facilities, special emphasis is placed on Chinese agricultural construction. Ten percent of the total amount of this $338 million aid plan is specifically designated for agricultural construction. In addition, the China Economic Survey Team includes Dr. Mayville, an expert on agricultural issues, who will provide Director Hoffman with methods on how to utilize these funds after investigating the Chinese agricultural economy. Furthermore, according to a United Press report from Washington on the 1st, China and the United States are discussing the establishment of an Agricultural Construction Committee, to be composed of two Americans and three Chinese, to investigate China's needs in agricultural construction. The United States' emphasis on and active assistance in our country's agricultural construction is of great significance from any perspective.</p>
<p>Currently, China's economic situation is indeed on the verge of bankruptcy due to the increasingly expanding scope of the Communist rebellion and destruction. In terms of national finance, revenue and expenditure cannot be balanced, and the government has to rely on increasing the issuance of currency to maintain operations, leading to today's malignant inflation. In terms of people's livelihood, prices are rising day and night, almost to the point of making life unbearable. Therefore, the entire nation, recognizing the severity of China's economic crisis, attaches great importance to the utilization of the American aid plan. Although the aid funds are limited to $338 million, which is hardly enough to meet China's needs in all aspects, this amount is still a substantial sum during China's economic difficulties. If it can be used well, it can serve as a turning point for China's economic recovery. Conversely, if this fund is not cherished and allowed to be wasted, then American aid will not be effective, and there will be no hope for China's economic recovery. Therefore, how to make good use of American aid is a pressing issue for our country, and the US authorities' emphasis on the use of American aid and special attention to our country's agricultural construction is precisely because of this.</p>
<p>Today, the agricultural issue related to people's food has become a serious problem for all countries in the world. The British economist Malthus's theory of population states that the rate of population increase exceeds the land's ability to produce food. We do not need to overemphasize this pessimistic view, but we cannot help but particularly emphasize the importance of increasing agricultural production in the face of food shortages in various countries around the world. As the saying goes, "Food is the paramount necessity of the people." If a famine occurs in any corner of the world, local society will not be stable. Looking at countries around the world, this is the case everywhere. The unrest in Western European countries is still due to the "bread problem." The instability in Asian countries is still due to the "eating problem." Life magazine, published on May 10th, also stated that food supply must double in the next twenty-five years, otherwise famine will occur. Looking back at China, the sufficiency or insufficiency of food for the people has often been the dividing line between governance and chaos in Chinese history. Therefore, at times of dynastic change, there has always been a set of theories to reform the land system. Now the land issue has reached a point where reform is imperative.</p>
<p>Throughout its history, our country has always been a country "founded on agriculture," with 80 percent of the national population being farmers. Before the War of Resistance Against Japan, due to adherence to outdated production techniques, coupled with perennial natural and man-made disasters, the rural areas were already on the verge of bankruptcy. By the time the War of Resistance broke out, the country had reached a critical juncture of survival, and the decline of the rural areas was regarded as a secondary issue. Not only that, but during the eight years of the War of Resistance, a large part of the rural areas fell under the occupation of the Japanese invaders, suffering destruction and devastation at the hands of the enemy, making the already riddled rural areas even more dilapidated. The remaining rural areas that were not occupied by the enemy made the greatest contribution to the War of Resistance in terms of manpower and military supplies for the liberation of the motherland. Under the dual pressures of requisitioning grain and soldiers, the rural areas naturally only deteriorated further. After the victory, it should have been possible to recuperate and first seek the recovery of the rural areas, and then further promote the prosperity of the rural areas. However, the Communist rebellion followed one after another, not only spreading the flames of war to the rural areas, but also causing the Communists to devastate the rural areas to an extreme extent, even surpassing the enemy. In some places, the fields were deserted, and no one was cultivating them at all. In some places, although there were people cultivating, the harvests were far below those of the past due to the lack of technology and fertilizers. Therefore, in an agricultural country, the supply of food has also become a serious problem. If the current situation is not remedied, the food shortage will inevitably worsen, and the domestic disorder will be impossible to quell.</p>
<p>All scholars who study Chinese agriculture unanimously say that if one wants to save the crisis in Chinese agriculture today, one must simultaneously implement land reform and apply scientific technology. Regarding the former, this newspaper's editorial has already commented, while for the latter, we must pay special attention to the United States' assistance to our country's agricultural construction. However, whether the United States' plan to assist our country in agricultural construction can achieve its intended goals, we believe that both China and the United States need to make further efforts. On the Chinese side, it must be understood that the Chinese agricultural problem is a problem that requires both institutional reform and the utilization of technology to be implemented simultaneously. Implementing only one of them without complementing the other will not achieve good results. Therefore, in order to cooperate with the American aid plan, our authorities should first implement land reform, so that all rural areas in the country can achieve "land to the tillers," laying a solid foundation for the United States to assist our country in engaging in agricultural construction. As for the United States, we would also like to take advantage of Dr. Mayville's upcoming visit to China to offer a suggestion to the US authorities. The United States' emphasis on Chinese agricultural construction is indeed a wise and insightful view. However, reforming Chinese agriculture must focus on improving production technology so that it can achieve the goal of increasing production in the short term. However, the funds required for this are enormous and cannot be solved with just over thirty million US dollars. Therefore, we hope that the wise US authorities, in order to assist China in engaging in agricultural construction and fundamentally solve the Chinese food shortage problem, should enact another bill to expand the scope of assistance in order to rebuild Chinese agriculture!</p>
<p>In short, the real crisis of the Chinese economy lies not in the decline of urban industry and commerce, but in the bankruptcy of the rural economy. We hope that the Chinese government, under the principle of "self-reliance," can make good use of American aid and implement a comprehensive rural construction policy.</p>

<h3>Dabie Mountain: Nameless Hero - Twenty Years of Military Life, Never Wounded Once</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent, Xinyang, May 29th, Airmail] Tall, with a robust physique, handsome and generous, this is General Zhang Xudong, the nameless hero who roams the Dabie Mountains, inflicting heavy damage on the communists everywhere.</p>
<p>The Huai River Corridor</p>
<p>He is from Shangcheng, Henan. He joined the army at eighteen, initially leading just over a hundred men in suppressing bandits in his hometown. Due to his youth, capability, bravery, and skill in battle, he repeatedly achieved extraordinary feats and was valued by his superiors. Two years later, he was promoted to battalion commander. At that time, the communist suppression reached a climax in Jiangxi, and Liu Zhenhua was stationed on the border of Henan, Hubei, and Anhui, responsible for the suppression work. Zhang, with one battalion, confronted a communist division, earning the appreciation of General Liu and being promoted to deputy commander. In the 24th year of the Republic (1935), when Zhang Xueliang was the Commander-in-Chief of Bandit Suppression and Central China was reorganized, political undercurrents drove him to quietly leave the post he had fought for seven years and go to neighboring Anhui Province. He joined his old superior, serving in the 11th Route Army. When the War of Resistance against Japan broke out, elders from his hometown repeatedly urged him, and he returned to Dabie Mountain, raising the banner of resistance. He reorganized his former subordinates into a formidable force, like a pangolin, traversing the forests of the Dabie Mountains, eliminating countless enemies, destroying dozens of strongholds, and cutting over five hundred pounds of enemy communication lines. Since the victory, due to his many years of outstanding service, he was supported by the people of his hometown and appointed as the Magistrate of Shangcheng County. In the 36th year of the Republic (1947), when the Central China communists became rampant, Liu Bocheng, following Li Xiannian, fled to the Dabie Mountains. Zhang, due to his responsibilities, acted urgently, abandoning his political career as county magistrate and making a comeback. Utilizing his former officers and mobilizing the strength of the people, he established today's Security Regiment. For twenty years, he has been galloping through the wind and sand. He is so familiar with the rural landscapes, mountains, rivers, every small ditch, stream, and path in the Dabie Mountains, as if they are a map constantly hanging in his mind. Therefore, he can stand firm in the Dabie Mountains. He can use the isolated city of Zhengyang to control the great plains north of the Huai River, preventing the communists from moving freely in the Huai River corridor.</p>
<p>Soldiers Come from Hometowns</p>
<p>During my one-day stay in Zhengyang, although he extended his warmest hospitality, with meals and accommodation together, he was simultaneously busy visiting local administrative leaders and inspecting the battlefield, leaving me no time to have a detailed conversation with him. Because I had to leave the next morning, it was not until 11 PM that I obtained his permission for a long talk. When he talked about the growth of his troops, it was as if he was describing a nanny raising a baby to adulthood, exhausting his efforts and enduring difficulties to maintain it until today.</p>
<p>His soldiers can be said to be his "younger brothers," mostly from his hometown. Although they are not truly related, the bonds of hometown sentiment and sharing hardships and difficulties for seven or eight, even ten years, have created an everlasting river of emotion between him and his brothers.</p>
<p>Light Equipment and Strong Mobility</p>
<p>His troops are a completely civilian force, carrying their own guns and automatically fighting bandits. This is the only people's army. It has many advantages: light equipment, high mobility, able to disperse and regroup at will. During the War of Resistance against Japan, when there were no battles during the busy farming season, they were given leave to return home to plant rice seedlings and cultivate fields for three or six months, and then they would return without prior agreement, with no one missing. His troops have good discipline, not violating even the slightest thing. They do not seek vanity, only practicality. They only know how to bury their heads and work hard, regardless of whether the country knows or not, always sticking to their posts. Their battle achievements are no less than those of the National Army. In the past, with two battalions, they defended for seven days. Liu Bocheng led four columns, launching fierce attacks in rotation, but ultimately could not cross the Lei Pool by a single step. In the victory at Liulin, they stormed the communist headquarters with a squad of men, capturing senior communist officers and seizing many spoils of war. This time in Zhengyang, they fought bitterly with more than 40,000 communists besieging the city, eventually defeating them and achieving an unprecedented victory. They have so many merits, but they are not proud at all, continuing to work hard and display a spirit of perseverance and determination.</p>
<p>He Was a Lieutenant Colonel for Ten Years</p>
<p>Speaking of their treatment, it is pitiful, even worse than that of beggars in Shanghai. The allowance for non-staple food is low, and salaries are meager, needless to say. Moreover, the source of this money does not rely on national supplies but is supported by local gentry and people with a sense of justice. They cannot eat their fill, cannot sleep peacefully, have no salaries, do not seek fame, do not seek profit. What is it for? There is no doubt that it is for the great goal of suppressing the rebellion and building the country. Their brothers often say, "We only fulfill our responsibility, the natural duty of a citizen. As for whether the country wants to give us treatment or rewards, that is another matter." Regiment Commander Zhang also said, "I will contribute as much strength as I have, I will defend a city, I will definitely defend it to the end, until the last gun and the last bullet, I will still fight to the end." We talked for three full hours, but there was no sense of fatigue. Time was too ruthless. We had to leave the next day. We mutually held a reluctant feeling, and at two o'clock in the middle of the night, we ended this detailed conversation. Walking out of his bedroom, the lively and vibrant shadows of those soldiers seemed to be still hovering in my mind's memory.</p>
<p>In his twenty years of military life, he has never been wounded once, received eleven citations for merit, and won two medals. He has been a lieutenant colonel for ten years. It is said that Commander Zhang has recently promoted him to a major general. I silently wish this nameless hero well. (Our Reporter, Bu Mian)</p>

<h3>Bernadotte in Contact with Arabs and Jews to Discuss Ceasefire Date in the Holy Land; Twenty-One U.S. Officers to Participate in Supervising the Ceasefire</h3>
<p>[Our Report] London 3rd Radio Broadcast: Cairo News, Bernadotte is currently in contact with both the Jewish and Arab sides to discuss the exact date of the ceasefire in Palestine. It is expected that the ceasefire can be achieved this week.</p>
<p>[Our Report] New York 3rd Radio Broadcast: Washington News, the United States has tentatively selected 21 Army, Navy, and Air Force officers to supervise the ceasefire in Palestine for the United Nations and is currently awaiting a formal invitation from the United Nations.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Lake Success, 2nd] The United Nations Security Council tonight instructed Bernadotte, the mediator in the Palestine war, to quickly determine on-site the time for the start of the ceasefire between the Arab and Jewish sides. The resolution was announced as passed without a vote, with only the Soviet Union and Ukraine declaring their abstention.</p>
<p>According to the Soviet explanation, this is a consistent position of not supporting the dispatch of a mediator from the beginning. The instruction was signed and issued on the spot by the Syrian representative Curry, the rotating chairman for June. Curry also announced that a meeting would be held on Thursday afternoon to discuss ceasefire supervision matters. Previously, after the Security Council received replies from both the Arab and Jewish sides accepting the proposal for a four-week ceasefire, it held a meeting to discuss implementation measures. Chairman Curry ruled that both sides had unconditionally accepted the ceasefire and that the explanations and opinions listed in the replies from both sides could not be regarded as conditions. U.S. Representative Austin and other representatives then successively proposed giving the mediator three days to implement the ceasefire, which was not adopted. At the same time, the Palestinian Jewish army had revoked the third ceasefire order issued by the Israeli government at sunset today. The Jewish representative announced after the Security Council adjourned that the Jewish army had canceled the third ceasefire order and was fighting again, but would abide by the ceasefire as soon as the mediator stipulated the start time for the four-week ceasefire. Some Jews here have taken a cynical attitude towards the Security Council.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Lake Success, 3rd] The Security Council is scheduled to meet on the 3rd to discuss what kind of management should be implemented to enforce the ceasefire in Palestine. Before the start of the ceasefire, any serious combat behavior by either the Arab or Jewish side cannot be regarded as a violation of the ceasefire order.</p>

<h3>Jewish Army Advances; Arab League's Important Cities Under Threat</h3>

Also, a major battle is taking place near the city of Tulkarm, twenty-one miles northeast of Tel Aviv. The Israeli army occupied the Boch Heights, only three miles away from Tulkarm, and drove out a large number of Arab troops in the Nablus area. Last week, the Arab side claimed that the Iraqi army had set out from Tulkarm, reaching the coast and cutting Israel in two.

According to news from the front lines, the Jewish army used artillery for the first time in the attack on Jenin. The Jewish forces in Tulkarm claimed that the fighting was suspended at one point because the Jewish army complied with the premature ceasefire order at 3 a.m. on the 2nd, and now the offensives on all fronts have resumed.</p>
<h3>U.S. Aid for the Reconstruction of Japan and Korea; House Appropriations Committee Does Not Approve</h3>
<p>[Our Report] New York 3rd Radio Broadcast: Washington News, today the House Appropriations Committee strongly urged that the funds for the Marshall Plan and other foreign aid plans be reduced by 25 percent. The committee has submitted this opinion to the House, and a fierce debate is likely to occur tomorrow. The committee argued that global aid funds should be reduced to $6.0433 billion.

However, in terms of time, the originally scheduled twelve months are extended to fifteen months, which is equivalent to a 25 percent reduction. As for the $463 million in aid to China, it was not changed.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 2nd] The House Appropriations Committee passed the fund for the aid to China program without any changes, but did not pass $150 million out of the $220 million requested by the U.S. government to revive Japan, Korea, and the Ryukyu Islands. The committee argued that if the government wanted to use $150 million to revive the occupied territories in the Far East, it could draw it from the funds of other Economic Cooperation Administration programs. However, the committee passed all of the funds requested by the government to relieve the people of Japan and Korea, totaling $424 million for Japan and $107 million for Korea, to prevent disease and unrest.</p>

<h3>Arab League Proposes Nine Points on Ceasefire Proposal; Advocates Establishing an Impartial Institution to Supervise the Ceasefire</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Cairo, 2nd] The Arab countries' response to the Security Council's proposal for a ceasefire in the Holy Land put forward the following nine points: (1) Nothing is more desired by the Arab governments than the restoration of peace in the Holy Land and the friendly coexistence of the Jewish and Arab residents. The Arab governments believe that there must be guarantees for the ceasefire, otherwise the ceasefire will only be a preparation for larger-scale battles; (2) The Arab governments acknowledge that the Security Council has considered their previous opinions, namely that the ceasefire should only seek a reasonable solution. Therefore, the Arab countries are very satisfied with the Security Council's appointment of a mediator to maintain contact with both the Jewish and Arab sides; (3) The main mission of the mediator is to obtain a peaceful and reasonable solution. The Arab governments are convinced that the mediator will confirm that resolutions that do not comply with the will of the majority of local residents and do not conform to the principle of political unity in Palestine cannot be successful; (4) Opening the doors of Palestine and allowing the unrestricted immigration of Jews undoubtedly runs counter to the purpose of the ceasefire and is the greatest threat to the Palestinian Arab people and the entire security of the Middle East; (5) The Arab governments are convinced that the purpose of the Security Council cannot be to allow the Jews to take advantage of the ceasefire to allow a large number of young men of military age to flood into Palestine in the name of immigration. These young men are clearly combatants who are prohibited from entering Palestine during the ceasefire period under Chapter Two of the Security Council's resolution; (6) The Arab governments hope to have an impartial and capable institution to monitor the implementation of the resolutions related to the Security Council and the ceasefire order; (7) The Arab governments do not believe that the Security Council's resolution has adequate guarantees to ensure that both parties will strictly abide by the ceasefire conditions and rules. For this reason, the Arab governments, in their capacity as members of the Arab League, are willing to cooperate with the mediator and the United Nations Ceasefire Committee to supervise the implementation of the ceasefire regulations and conditions; (8) In order to establish peace in the Holy Land and seek a reasonable solution, the Arab governments accept the Security Council's proposal for a four-week ceasefire, the term of which will be calculated from a date to be determined; (9) The Arab governments' acceptance of this proposal is sufficient to prove their sincerity in cooperating with the United Nations to seek a reasonable solution.</p>
<h3>US Strengthens Bases in Japan: Yokosuka Becomes a Mini Pearl Harbor, Honshu's Giant Airfield Only 700 Miles from Vladivostok</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Tokyo, 2nd] Allied observers here feel that the United States' policy toward Japan has gradually changed. The US military intends not merely to be a pure occupation force, but to strengthen its bases in Japan. The United States seems unwilling to convene a peace conference with Japan quickly in order to extend its stay in Japan. Although MacArthur recently reiterated his desire to convene a peace conference with Japan as soon as possible, his opinion does not seem to have received full support from the Army authorities and the State Department. Currently, on Kyushu, Honshu, and the islands of Hokkaido, Japan's original airfields have been greatly expanded.</p>
<p>Kyushu recently completed a new airfield, and at the northern tip of Honshu, a airfield is being built that can accommodate the largest bombers currently being designed in the United States. The site is only 700 miles from Vladivostok. Unofficial estimates put the cost of constructing the airfield at US$13 million. Since the Far Eastern Commission has not allowed Japan to operate domestic or international air routes, these airfields are clearly not for Japan's use. The US Navy base in Japan, Yokosuka, is also being permanently planned, with new construction no less than a mini Pearl Harbor. These symbols are sufficient to indicate the United States' unwillingness to leave Japan. Although senior US officials deny that the United States will support Japan as its military ally, they do not deny that the United States will remain in Japan based on military needs. In addition to military equipment, the United States has also spent a large amount of money in Japan. If Clapp's proposal is implemented, even more money will be spent. The United States certainly does not want this huge investment in the Far East to fall into the economic sphere of influence of the other side after the conclusion of a peace treaty with Japan.</p>
<h3>Urging MacArthur to Return Home: Effectively Abandoned</h3>
<p>US Senate Appropriations Committee Makes No New Recommendations</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 3rd] The Senate Appropriations Committee took no further action on the 3rd to urge MacArthur to return home to report on the Far Eastern situation. Since the Appropriations Committee is not taking formal action, the issue has apparently been considered closed. The committee is unlikely to invite MacArthur to return home before the Republican National Convention convenes.</p>

<h3>ECAFE Debate: Indonesia's Participation</h3>
<p>Differing Views Among Countries on Indonesia's Status</p>
<p>[Reuters, Ootacamund, South India, 2nd] The United Nations Economic Commission for Asia and the Far East meeting today was disrupted by a dispute over the status of the Indonesian representative within an hour of convening. This issue was raised at the last meeting of the Commission, but was not resolved. The question is whether the Yogyakarta-based Indonesian Republican government will be an associate member or part of the Dutch delegation. Britain and France support the Dutch position, while India, Australia, Burma, Ceylon, and Pakistan support the participation of the Indonesian representative as an associate member representative. The Soviet representative also supports India's opinion.</p>

<h3>Special Criminal Court Declares Non-Acceptance: Dance Craze Case Transferred to District Prosecutor's Office, Most of the Detained Male and Female Defendants Expected to Be Released on Bail the Day After Tomorrow</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper] The sensational dance craze case, after the police department transferred the case to the Special Criminal Court for trial, the case was pronounced in the Special Court at 2 pm yesterday. Many people went to listen to the hearing. At 2:10 pm, Chief Judge Wang Zhennan, Judge Sun Tiqian, Judge Xu Nai, and Clerk Xu Leshi took their seats, brought in the 37 defendants in custody, including Zhu Fei, and called for the 30 defendants on bail, standing on both sides. At this time, the atmosphere in the court suddenly became tense, and everyone's eyes were focused on the judgment on the case file, not knowing who would be punished. Then, Chief Judge Wang stood up and read the main text of the judgment: "This case is not accepted." After hearing the judgment, the defendants said "Thank you, Chief Judge." Hong Xiaoping and Wang Min, who had been crying, smiled through their tears. Subsequently, Clerk Xu stood up and read the reasons for the judgment and explained them, stating that "The crimes of the defendants are ordinary criminal offenses and do not constitute Article 7 of the Statute for Punishing Those Who Endanger National Emergency During the Period of Suppressing Rebellion. The police department transferred the case to this court for trial, and the prosecution procedure was obviously in violation of the regulations. It is ordered that the case is not accepted and is transferred to the District Prosecutor's Office for handling." Chief Judge Wang briefly explained the case again. All the defendants in custody raised their hands to request bail, which was not approved. It was ordered that they be transferred to the District Prosecutor's Office for investigation. The court adjourned at 3:00 pm. At 3:30 pm, the Special Criminal Court formally transferred the 37 defendants in custody, including Zhu Fei, to the District Prosecutor's Office. Chief Prosecutor Huang Liang immediately dispatched two prosecutors, He Huimin and Zhang Yuanzhen, to handle the case. After briefly questioning the names and ages of the defendants, bail was not granted because the case files were voluminous and required time to review. They were temporarily detained at the South Road Detention Center. However, it is heard that most of them are expected to be released on bail the day after tomorrow.</p>
<p>Reasons for the Judgment</p>
<p>The original text of the reasons for the judgment of the case is recorded below: "After the Central Government issued the ban on dancing, the people engaged in the dance hall industry in the city, for the sake of their livelihoods, labor and management jointly formed a joint office of all people in the Shanghai dance hall industry, specializing in negotiating with the authorities on the issue of the ban on dancing. Therefore, they raised funds and elected representatives to go to Beijing to petition, but to no avail. Then, the Shanghai Municipal Social Affairs Bureau, in order to implement the central government's order, taking into account the facts, decided to gradually ban dancing in stages, and scheduled the first draw to be held at 3:00 pm on January 31st of this year. Upon hearing this news, the joint office of the dance hall industry summoned all personnel, and they held a meeting at the New Xianlin Dance Hall on that day to discuss the issue of the draw. Suddenly, news came that the Social Affairs Bureau had held a proxy draw at 11:00 am, and fourteen dance halls, including MGM, had been drawn and should be closed. At that time, the atmosphere at the meeting suddenly became tense, and everyone unanimously demanded to go to the Social Affairs Bureau to petition, and at 3:00 pm, about thousands of female dancers and workers (only Jin Ying was not a female dancer, but was invited by female dancer Chen Juping) went to the Social Affairs Bureau to petition, requesting a temporary suspension of the ban on dancing in order to maintain their livelihoods. It happened that the Social Affairs Bureau was in a meeting and could not come out to see them immediately. The petitioning crowd felt disappointed. For a moment, they were emotionally impulsive</p>
<p>Emotional Impulse</p>
<p>and rushed upstairs to destroy the Social Affairs Bureau. All the doors, windows, glass, and appliances were almost completely destroyed. The Shanghai Labor-Management Arbitration Committee was working on the third floor of the Social Affairs Bureau, and the petitioning crowd mistakenly thought it was the Social Affairs Bureau, so it was also affected. The police who followed to maintain order were injured by being beaten while trying to prevent the destruction. At that time, the order in the Social Affairs Bureau was extremely chaotic. The Shanghai Municipal Police Department reported that it immediately dispatched a team to suppress the situation and arrested many people successively. After interrogation, it was determined that 69 people, including Zhu Fei, were suspected of intentionally disturbing public order and destroying public offices by other means, which constituted the crime of Article 7 of the Statute for Punishing Those Who Endanger National Emergency During the Period of Suppressing Rebellion. In accordance with Article 3, Paragraph 2 of the Special Criminal Case Litigation Statute, except for 32 people, including Yu Zhiqin, who were released on bail pending trial, 37 people, including Zhu Fei, were transferred to the court for trial. Now, based on the results of the trial, regardless of who among the defendants actually carried out the damage or who beat the police,</p>
<p>A Prior Question, Whether or Not the Statute for Punishing Those Who Endanger National Emergency During the Period of Suppressing Rebellion Should Be Applied to this Case, and Whether or Not This Court Should Try It, Should Be Determined by Whether or Not the Defendants Intended to Disturb Public Order and Destroy Public Offices by Other Means. Regarding this point, it can be analyzed as follows: (1) Destroying a public office. The so-called public office is the entire building used by the Social Affairs Bureau to conduct business. What has been destroyed now is only the doors, windows, glass, and appliances in the house, not the essential parts of the building. According to the previous Judgment No. 470 of the Supreme Court of Justice in the Third Year of the Republic of China, "The crime of damaging a building requires damaging the essential parts of the building, which is sufficient to cause the building to lose its effectiveness for the crime to be established. If only the accessories are damaged, it falls within the scope of damaging objects." Based on the determination of precedents, it is difficult to consider it as damaging a public office. (2) Intending to disturb public order. Investigating the assembly of a large number of people to carry out damage, the impact of which certainly hinders order. Speaking of disturbing public order, it is not entirely consistent with the Supreme Court's Judgment No. 1942 of the 22nd Year of the Republic of China, which states that "The so-called disturbing public order refers to disturbing behavior that is sufficient to harm the general peace and order in the locality." Moreover, the purpose of going to the Social Affairs Bureau, reviewing the investigation reports of Zhu Mengwei, the chief of the Shanghai Municipal Police Department, and Jin Xingguo, a staff member, as well as the meeting minutes of the dance industry's previous meetings, and the consistent statements of the defendants, their motives were to</p>
<p>Temporarily Suspend the Ban on Dancing</p>
<p>and Petition, lacking active proof of intending to disturb public order. Furthermore, testifying with Li Ying, the leader of the political team of the Songshan Police Precinct, who said: "That day, I was ordered to go to the Social Affairs Bureau to investigate. At first, the order was still good. Later, I asked to see the Director. It was heard that the Director was in a meeting and could not receive them. Most likely, the female dancers were angry, which led to the temporary incident of attacking the Social Affairs Bureau." It feels even more credible. As for injuring the police who were performing their duties during the destruction, it can only constitute the crimes of obstructing official duties and injury under criminal law. Based on the above two points, the crimes committed by the defendants are all</p>
<p>Ordinary Criminal</p>
<p>Cases and do not constitute the crime of Article 7 of the Statute for Punishing Those Who Endanger National Emergency During the Period of Suppressing Rebellion. The original transferring agency transferred it to this court for trial, and the prosecution procedure was obviously in violation of the regulations. It should be ordered that it is not accepted and transferred to the Shanghai District Court Prosecutor's Office for handling in accordance with the law. Based on the above conclusions, in accordance with Article 2 of the Special Criminal Court Trial Statute and Article 295, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Procedure Law, the judgment is hereby made as stated in the main text."</p>

<h3>Shanghai Indian Consul General Arrives</h3>

<h3>Violating the Publication Law: Times Daily News Suspended</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper] The Municipal Government Information Office announced yesterday: The Shanghai Times Daily News served as an instrument for the bandits, Zhang, disrupting government financial policies, inciting student and worker strikes, fabricating rumors, and distorting propaganda. The Municipal Government has issued serious warnings several times. However, on the 3rd of this month, the newspaper again had distorted records of inciting student strikes, which was obviously an intentional attempt to make a big issue out of the situation and disrupt social order. It violated Articles 21 and 29 of the Publication Law. Yesterday, the Municipal Government ordered the Social Affairs Bureau and the Police Department to immediately suspend the newspaper's publication and has reported it to the Ministry of Interior.</p>
<h3>Newspaper Workers' Union Board of Directors and Supervisors Discuss: Striving for Preferential Rationing of Rice</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper] According to the Newspaper Workers' Union, the Civil Affairs Commission's preferential rice rationing measures for news practitioners did not provide rationing for newspaper workers. Yesterday, the union specifically convened an emergency meeting of the board of directors and supervisors. Directors Sun Jinghu, Li Xingsheng, Hua Guozheng, Shen Xirong, Xu Jinlin, Li Shengrun, Tang Genbao, Zhang Dechao, Chen Jianming, Sheng Buyun, Miao Shengchang, Zhang Ziqi, Dai Fuquan, and supervisors Hu Zhiwen, Dong Rengui, Zhang Jinbao, Sun Jinshui, Zhang Hexiang, and others attended. They all believed that the Civil Affairs Commission's current rationing, while calling it rice rationing for news practitioners, intentionally excluded the most laborious workers with lower wages, which was unfair. It was unanimously decided to prepare a document to the Civil Affairs Commission requesting reconsideration, and workers should be given the same preferential rationing.</p>
<h3>What Chief Judge Wang Said: This Place is a Fire Pit, It is a Great Blessing to Jump Out</h3>
<p>Side View of the Pronouncement: Yesterday was the "Moment of Life and Death" for sixty-something men and women in the dance industry. Before 2:00 pm, the audience seats were already full. A bailiff was blocking the door, and forty or fifty people could not get in. The bailiff's waist belt had a box cannon inserted under it, which added to the tension.</p>
<p>The defendants in custody looked more haggard, while the defendants on bail were still carefree. Yangzi You Lingling even put on lipstick, and Rong Yingfeng from Paramount wore a black cheongsam today, which was a bit more simple than a few days ago. The clerk read the judgment, and the courtroom was silent. It was truly "Silence at This Time is Better Than Sound," replacing the joy in the hearts of many people.</p>
<p>After Chief Judge Wang finished reading the judgment, he gave a personal instruction: "This case is not accepted, but that does not mean that you are not guilty. It means that your crime is not a crime that endangers the country, so the defendants in custody will be sent to the District Prosecutor's Office for trial today. But don't be afraid. You should know that this place is a fire pit. It is a great blessing to be able to jump out. If the court sentences you in the future, I hope you will calmly accept the sentence. At the same time, I also advise you to engage in productive construction undertakings in the future. Dancing is consumption, what good is it for the country?" If the courtroom allowed it, I think someone would definitely applaud greatly. The lawyers requested bail, and Chief Judge Wang said: "Since this case is not accepted, this court will not care about anything. Please do not let me be said to be playing a post-hoc strategy." When the defendants in custody were sent to the District Prosecutor's Office, before leaving, Hong Xiaoping, Tang Zongjie, Wang Min, Feng Aina, Zhu Fei, and others hurriedly told their families: "Quick! Go to Lujiawan and find a way to get bail!"</p>

<h3>Shanghai Law College Has Resumed Classes as Usual: Xu Jiqing Expresses Comfort</h3>
<p>Xu Jiqing, a director of Shanghai Law College, wrote yesterday: "I reviewed the Shanghai Law College incident at the Municipal Government yesterday and invited people from all walks of life to hold a symposium. At the meeting, I expressed my opinion, advocating that the organizers of the exhibition be investigated and severely punished, and that all illegal activities be thoroughly banned. Otherwise, even if it is dissolved, it will be unavoidable. These are angry words. Now that I know that the college has resumed classes as usual and the order is stable, which is in line with what I hoped for, there is no question of dissolution. I am deeply afraid of causing misunderstandings, so I specially send this letter to your newspaper and ask you to publish it."</p>
<h3>Children's Welfare Charity Sale: Chinese and Foreign Ladies Enthusiastically Select Purchases, The Splendor of Hairpins and Clothes Peaks for Two Hours</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper] The Shanghai Children's Work Group of the China Welfare Fund held a children's welfare charity sale at the ballroom on the 11th floor of the Hua Mao Apartment on Bushi Road from 5 pm yesterday. Madam Sun Yat-sen, Soong Ching-ling, personally presided over it. The interior was decorated with lanterns and colored ribbons, and the arrangement was excellent. In addition to the charity items donated by international celebrities in the city, there were also more than ten boxes of antiques that Madam Sun Yat-sen had collected before the war and transported to Europe for sale. These antiques were transported to France when the German army occupied it, which led to them being transferred around for eight years. They were only recently found in Marseille and transported back. They included ancient bottles, ancient paintings, precious embroidery, hanging skirt dresses, and so on. The entertainment section included fishing paper fish, ring toss, ball toss, shooting, and fortune-telling by Madame Alkon, a White Russian. Well-known ladies served as staff in the venue. Chinese celebrities and ladies from various countries in the city went to watch and purchase enthusiastically. The splendor of hairpins and clothes peaked for a while. The charity sale ended at 11 pm. Many charity items were sold, and the total revenue was not calculated due to the late hour. All proceeds from this charity sale will be used to fund the education and medical work of poor children in Shanghai.</p>

<h3>President of St. John's University Announces Resignation: School Affairs Temporarily Handled by the Executive Committee of the Board of Trustees, Several Conflicts Among Students Injure Two</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper] Several conflicts occurred among students at St. John's University yesterday. Shi Jiuyu, the chairman of the student union who had been suspended from school for one year by the school, was seriously injured. Chen Wenhan (female), the minister of the liaison department of the student union who had also been punished by the school in the same way, was also injured. There were several other minor injuries. Tu Yuqing, the president of the university, felt that it was difficult to deal with the turmoil in the school this time, and decided to resign yesterday morning. In addition to formally submitting his resignation to the board of trustees, he also issued a notice in the school saying: "Since Yuqing was appointed to preside over school affairs, he has maintained school affairs and strived for stability in an extremely difficult environment. However, I am incompetent and unable to fulfill the responsibility, so I have submitted my resignation to the board of trustees, and from now on, all school affairs will be handled by the school affairs executive committee. I hope that all students will cherish the school, maintain a calm attitude, and not take any extra-curricular actions. This notice."</p>
<p>The Entire Student Body Held a General Meeting</p>
<p>Because of the turmoil caused by the anti-American and pro-Japanese national exhibition organized by the student union in recent days, the St. John's University authorities held an emergency school affairs meeting on the evening of the 2nd and decided to suspend classes for a week from the 3rd to the 8th, and the final exams for this semester would start early on the 9th (originally scheduled for the 21st). During the suspension of classes, all classrooms, lounges, and auditoriums on campus would be closed and could not be borrowed. When the students heard the news of the sudden suspension of classes, they were quite surprised. Many believed that even if the actions of some students were out of line, it was a minority issue. Now, the school's sudden suspension of classes and early final exams affected the studies of the majority of students. Moreover, most of the courses in each department had not ended, and it was quite difficult to cope with the exams in a hurry. The student self-government association of the school held a general meeting of all students yesterday morning to discuss the matter.</p>
<p>Offering Opinions, No Response</p>
<p>Because the lounges, auditoriums, etc. were all closed, the meeting was held at the South Grass Field. More than 1,000 students attended. During the meeting, students could not agree on their opinions. Some students criticized the student union for only being anti-American and not anti-Soviet. In the chaos, the president came out to persuade them, claiming that the school authorities' decision to suspend classes was to seek stability on campus and had no other purpose. When the meeting continued, it was ended because the tables and chairs on the podium were overturned. Some students sent several representatives to visit the president, offering several points of opinion: (1) Handle the so-called student union based on the results of the school's solicitation of opinions from the parents of each student on the student union at the beginning of this semester. (2) Request the school to severely punish all those responsible for illegal gatherings and instigators. (3) Request the school to declare to all sectors of society the truth about the incident of a small number of people disrupting the school for the reputation of the school and all students. The president did not give a specific response, and within half an hour, he resigned.</p>
<p>Martial Drama Occurred in Zhaofeng Park</p>
<p>After the student union suspended the meeting, the students left one after another, but hundreds of people still stayed in groups of three or five, lingering. There were also small conflicts between them. At about 12:00 noon, Shi Jiuyu and Chen Wenhan were attacked and injured in Zhaofeng Park. Some of them held weapons. They were later rescued by the police officers in the park. Pan Shizi, the acting dean of students, also rushed to the scene after hearing the news. The injured were taken to Tongren Hospital by their classmates for emergency treatment. In the evening, they were accompanied by their relatives and friends and transferred to other places for treatment. After this incident, some of the school directors of the board of trustees held an informal meeting in the afternoon to exchange opinions. Regarding the injuries of Shi Jiuyu and Chen Wenhan, they believed that Shi and Chen were dragged out of the school when the incident occurred, and the location of the attack was outside the school. Moreover, the identities of the group were unknown. This was a public security issue, and the school could not handle it, so it was decided to report the matter to the public security authorities for disposal. As for the resignation of President Tu, it needs to be discussed by the entire board of directors after Chairman Yan Huiqing returns to Shanghai from Beijing. Currently, school affairs are temporarily handled by the executive committee of the board of trustees.</p>

<h3>窑货砖瓦石灰　竟日无人搬运　二千馀工人　举行大请愿</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Over two thousand, one hundred dockworkers transporting kiln goods, bricks, tiles, and lime in this city yesterday morning took 57 trucks to petition the Social Bureau, the Municipal Government, the Police Bureau, and the General Labor Union, stating that Tang Xueyuan and others were using local power to compete for business, and recounting the incident near Tanjiawan where they gathered a crowd to beat up the chairman, Wang Lihai, and others. They demanded punishment for the perpetrators, assurance of work safety, and investigation of derelict police officers from the Zhabei Police Sub-bureau, totaling seven demands. The petitioning workers arrived at the Social Bureau at 9:15 AM, where they were received by Wang Jiashu, the Director of the Second Division, who promised to forward the details of the disputes to the Police Bureau and the District Procuratorate to investigate the truth and handle the matter according to the law.

The Ministry of Communications has also approved a 90% increase in passenger and freight rates on all routes starting from the 5th. However, passenger fares on the Shanghai-Taiwan route will be adjusted by 25% of the original price, while freight rates will remain unchanged.</p>
<h3>四明山海盗　在本市落纲</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] At 5:00 PM on the 28th of last month, the Water Police Sub-bureau received a report that some pirates from Siming Mountain were hiding in Shanghai. They sent officers in disguise to investigate the Yushi Market area and arrested pirate Zhang Baorong. Forty-four bullets were found on his person. He confessed that his accomplices Zhang Jinlin lived at 47 Yiren Lane, Linqing Road, Pudong, and Xie Kunquan lived at 85 Alley 208, Tongbei Road. Police were dispatched to arrest them all. However, the squadron leader, Lu Bin, rented a place near the New Zha Gate Bridge, and fled after hearing the news when officers were sent to apprehend him.</p>
<h3>储匪残部　劫船渡海</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report from Hangzhou, 3rd] According to news from Yuyao, over a hundred remnants of Chu Guibin's bandit gang crossed from Nanshan Ferry to Dantou Bay on the night of the 30th of last month, robbed two salt boats at Gaowang Temple in Andong, and another boat at Xiamajialong, and escaped to the Pudong area by sea. This reporter confirmed this news with the Provincial Security Headquarters. According to them, the province only received reports of an attempt to cross the sea, and had not heard of them actually taking to the sea.</p>
<h3>汇丰银行　妨碍地方建设　拓宽虹桥路　工程受阻梗</h3>
<p>The Longhua District Office of this city, in order to follow the suggestions of the local people, submitted a proposal to the Municipal Bureau of Public Works, which was approved by the 104th Municipal Meeting. It decided to widen Hongqiao Road 300 Lane to facilitate travel, and local people raised funds and landowners voluntarily gave up land. The Municipal Bureau of Public Works had nearly completed the project, but the HSBC Bank garden, located on the north side of the road and occupying more than a hundred acres, only needed to give up about two-tenths of an acre for the road widening. To this day, it has refused to move the bamboo fence, causing construction to stop midway. Yesterday, the district held a district people's congress, which unanimously agreed that the bank was hindering local construction and resolved to request the Municipal Bureau of Public Works to continue completing the entire road project and notify the bank to quickly cede the land.</p>

<h3>规定影院低价座额　社局决予严格执行</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Director Wu of the Social Bureau, regarding the opposition of movie theaters to low-price limited-price seats and the request of Western film companies to adjust ticket prices, otherwise they will stop supplying Western films for public showing, stated yesterday: The maintaining of 30% low-price seats in each movie theater was approved by the municipal meeting so that the majority of citizens can enjoy entertainment. Therefore, it will be strictly enforced and will not be stopped because of the opposition of movie theaters. The Social Bureau will post a public notice with the Police Bureau, posting the map of the discounted seats in front of each movie theater so that citizens can know. Director Wu explained that the authorities do not limit the price of seats outside the 30% quota in each movie theater. The trade association can adjust prices according to the living index adjustment method, based on the rate of increase in other prices. If movie theaters can maintain their operational guarantee after adjusting ticket prices, the authorities will not interfere. Also, the price of low-price seats is not fixed. As for the Western film companies stopping the supply of Western films, Director Wu said he did not value it.</p>
<h3>参会决议案检讨会　今日会商访问对象</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The Municipal Council will hold a resolution review committee today at 2:00 PM. As a result of the Municipal Council's Fifth General Assembly, there are many resolutions. How the various departments directly under and affiliated to the Municipal Government are implementing them is not yet known. During the Municipal Council's Fourth General Assembly, there was already an organization for visiting groups.

Today's meeting will determine the targets for the visits and the dates for the group visits.</p>
<h3>欠租判付美钞　自有法律根据</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The Shanghai Restaurant in this city rents its premises from the New Wonderland Dance Hall. Due to overdue rent, the District Court previously ruled that the Shanghai Restaurant should pay the owed rent of US$1,000. The Tenants' Union of this city protested this ruling, believing that if this precedent is set, future tenants will suffer unbearable burdens. This reporter visited the person in charge of the District Court yesterday, who explained the ruling as follows: (1) The contract between the Shanghai Restaurant and the New Wonderland Dance Hall was signed on July 18, 1946, before the government announced the ban on the circulation of gold and foreign currency. Therefore, it cannot be considered illegal to contract in US dollars at that time. (2) The Shanghai Restaurant's rent arrears were from July to November 1943, before the Municipal Government promulgated the Housing Lease Regulations. (3) The judgment to pay in US dollars is calculated by converting to legal tender at the Central Bank's listed exchange rate, so the Shanghai Restaurant is not at a disadvantage.</p>
<h3>立莱厂配尼西林　市上发现有赝品</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Fake 200,000-unit injections of penicillin made by the American pharmaceutical company Lilly have recently been discovered on the market. The police have dispatched officers to investigate. It is understood that the most obvious way to distinguish the fake product on the paper box is that the characters for "Penicillin" are on top and the unit characters for the injection or tablet are on the bottom for the genuine product, while the fake one has them reversed. According to chemical tests, the ingredients of the fake drug are not harmful to the body, but its effectiveness is only one-tenth of the genuine product.</p>

<h3>伯大尼二百余孤儿　面临流离失所边缘　各界人士同情捐助者众</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Bethany Orphanage on Jiaotong Road, founded with great difficulty by the Christian pastor Qian Tuan Yun, has been around for six years. It has taken in more than 200 orphans and has achieved remarkable results, which everyone praises. Unfortunately, the housing dispute, which has been in litigation for many years, has recently been lost in the final judgment. More than 200 orphans are now facing the edge of displacement. People from all walks of life have great sympathy for the orphanage's plight, and have given spiritual and material encouragement to encourage pastor Qian to continue his efforts. The Bethany Board of Directors has launched a fundraising campaign to purchase land and build houses, targeting 150 billion, with major newspapers and the Continental Bank in this city acting as donation collection points so that more than 200 orphans will not be displaced. It is now learned that people from all walks of life are enthusiastically donating. Hu Yide, of the Da Zhong Brick and Tile Factory, is willing to donate more than 100 acres of land in Nanhui, Pudong. Ye Boxiang is also willing to donate more than 600 acres of land in Da Chang. Yesterday, the Deputy Manager of the Agricultural and Industrial Bank personally visited the orphanage and donated 10 million yuan. In addition, a primary school student sent a letter to pastor Qian stating that he would donate 30,000 yuan he had saved from snacks, a sincere gesture that is touching. However, it is understood that the other party is pressing for the eviction from Bethany and previously insisted in court that they must move out within five days. As a result, the court decided to set the deadline to the 12th, but in reality, it is difficult to find a new site within 12 days. All sectors of society are extremely concerned about this and hope that the winning party will consider the suffering of the orphans and grant an extension.</p>
<h3>日渔轮船员供认　大规模侵我渔权　笔录五十页整理就绪昨晚携京　是否将作俘虏处置现尚未可知</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] On the morning of the 29th of last month, our naval ship Zhongjian intercepted the Japanese fishing vessel Unzen Maru No. 22 and its 11 crew members, as well as 13 crew members from the Zhenxian Maru No. 111 (which had been sunk), near Shaweishan outside the mouth of the Yangtze River. They were detained at the Navy's First Base Command. From May 31 to June 2, Li Youjian, the director of the military law office of the department, conducted continuous interrogations for three days and nights, resulting in the discovery that the Japanese fishing boats' fishing in our waters was a planned infringement of our maritime rights. According to the captain of the Unzen Maru No. 21, Shimomura Kazuto: "Originally, there were more fish in the north, but that area is very dangerous, and Soviet fishing boats regularly patrol north of 38 degrees north latitude, so we came south." At the same time, according to the crew members' testimonies, it is known that Japanese fishing boats have come to fish many times, and the number of fishing boats dispatched is very considerable. According to Shimomura Kazuto: "A total of 20 ships came on this trip, divided into 10 groups... There are four major companies: Yamada, Hayashi-Kane, Nitto, and Nippon Suisan, etc. There are many other small companies. Hayashi-Kane alone has two or thirty groups." Crew member Kumakora Toshihisa said: "The company has ten groups in total. The In Group was the first to set sail, and we were the ninth group to set sail." He also testified, "The captain of the No. 22 ship said once, 'Now our ship is going to the Chinese inland sea.' He said this when we set sail from Nagasaki." From this, it can be seen that when the Japanese fishing boats set sail, they had already decided to infringe on our maritime rights.</p>
<p>Showing Gratitude for Our Favorable Treatment</p>
<p>According to Li Yuelin, the director of the press office of the Navy's First Base Command, in an interview with the reporter: According to crew member Kawaguchi Tadashi's testimony, "At first, the water was green, but later it turned yellowish-brown. I thought we might have reached the outside of the Yangtze River in China," and other words, it can be known that they were indeed within our country's territorial waters (including fishing rights areas), which is beyond any doubt. Also, after three days of interrogation, all the crew members admitted to fishing in Chinese territorial waters, infringing on maritime rights, and violating international law. They requested the government's forgiveness. At the same time, they expressed gratitude for the favorable treatment of our naval authorities and hoped that the case could be concluded as soon as possible and that they would be sent back to Japan. They also guaranteed to report their experience on this trip to the company authorities and pay more attention in the future.</p>
<p>Seized Ships Transferred to Supply Station</p>
<p>However, the Naval Headquarters attaches great importance to this case and has repeatedly sent telegrams urging that all confessions be sent to the headquarters for verification. The confessions have now been organized, totaling approximately 50 pages, and were sent to the capital last night. The seized ships have also been transferred to the Navy's First Supply Station. As our country and Japan have not yet signed a peace treaty and diplomatic relations have not been established, it seems that a state of war has not been lifted. Therefore, it is not yet known whether the detained crew members will be treated as prisoners of war. Regarding the fish caught on the ship, it has been instructed by the Naval Headquarters or the customs, or sold at a price, with 20% of the proceeds used as a bonus for the officers and soldiers of the Zhongjian ship who participated in the operation. As of now, no decision has been made.</p>
<p>Their Sinister Intentions Are Self-Evident</p>
<p>Finally, Director Li also expressed his feelings to reporters: "Japanese fishing boats infringing on our fishing rights have been negotiated many times, and the Allied Headquarters have stipulated the boundaries. There should be no further infringement. After interrogating the fishing boats seized this time, it is true that this was a large-scale infringement of fishing rights, and the number was huge. At the same time, the fishing boats had charts, depth sounders, compasses, telecommunications and other marine equipment, everything needed. Although they say that they came to fish in Chinese territorial waters because of the influence of the tide, their sinister intentions are self-evident. It is a pity that the No. 21 ship, the leader of the group (each group of two ships), was sunk, and the relevant evidence and various records on the ship could not be salvaged, which increased some difficulties in the investigation and future handling of this case. One injured crew member, Oda Takashi, has been sent to the Navy's First Hospital for treatment."</p>
<p>Furthermore, the Navy recently dispatched warships to Liangang Island and Hainan Island to pursue Japanese fishing boats. As of now, the base command has not received any reports.</p>

<h3>Three-Agency Joint Meeting Decides on Method for Offsetting Foreign Currency Certificates of Deposit, Importers Must Provide Foreign Exchange Settlement Certificate</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] According to regulations, the special foreign currency certificates of deposit that the government should pay to the original importers for goods arriving without a certificate of self-provided foreign exchange can be used to borrow one-sixth of the face value from the Central Bank to pay for the payment for goods permitted for import within the limited amount. Now, after the promulgation of the new foreign exchange settlement method, a registered importer, after obtaining an import permit, must provide a foreign exchange settlement certificate in addition to paying the exchange rate of the national currency when purchasing foreign exchange. Yesterday, at the joint meeting of the Central Bank's Shipping Management Committee and the China Trust Bureau, it was decided that when the China Trust Bureau gives priority to selling these goods, it should still charge according to the stabilization fund exchange rate as stipulated. As for the special foreign currency certificates of deposit paid to the original importers, they should still be exchanged for legal tender at the stabilization fund exchange rate when one-sixth of the amount is due each quarter. If a registered importer uses this certificate of deposit to offset the foreign exchange payment for permitted imports each quarter, it can offset the foreign exchange that should be purchased at the stabilization fund exchange rate. At the same time, the merchant must provide a separate foreign exchange settlement certificate, which must be verified before being allowed to offset the payment. According to the spokesperson of the joint meeting, the above method will be handled by the China Trust Bureau, and the Central Bank will notify all designated banks to investigate.</p>
<p>[Another Report] The National Bank and the Shipping Management Committee recently sent Circular No. 137 to all designated banks, explaining the foreign exchange settlement regulations for import licenses issued before May 31 of this year. It stated: The foreign exchange settlement method for import licenses issued before May 31 of this year has been stipulated in the Bank's Circular No. 135. Now, it is supplemented that the unsettled portion of the original installment foreign exchange settlement should still be handled in accordance with the (1) installment (2) foreign exchange settlement on the stipulated date, and a foreign exchange settlement certificate should be attached. However, permits issued for industrial manufacturing needs for the quota for the third and fourth quarters of this year, according to 25%, 35%, and 40% installment foreign exchange settlement, should still be handled according to Circular No. 135, and the previous regulations do not apply.</p>
<h3>米粉油粮昨又上涨</h3>
<p>Rice prices rose again, because the price in Xishi rose, and the money supply was loose, so people's confidence was restored, and the market recovered. Although the volume of transactions was not large, the supply was even smaller. Prices rose immediately after the market opened in the morning, and the market became increasingly firm. The opening price of white rice in the North City Market was 6.9 million yuan. Early rice and Xian rice each rose by 100,000 yuan. High-quality japonica rice rose by 200,000 yuan to 7.2 million yuan. All grades of japonica and indica rice in the South City Market rose by 100,000 yuan. Baiyuan and Yinyuan rose in unison. In terms of the firm closing trend, the actual increase was 200,000 yuan. Yesterday, a total of 3,325 shi of rice arrived in the north and south markets.</p>
<p>Flour</p>
<p>After the initial rise, it fell back, and finally saw a slight increase. The oldest Che Fen was initially 2.1 million, then gradually fell back to 2.06 million, while the price of the warship closed at 2.02 million, a slight increase of 10,000 yuan. Red Bee and Jiancheng also rose slightly. Wheat bran added 450,000 yuan, and the factory's purchase price of wheat did not increase, opening at 2.7 million yuan at the original price.</p>
<p>Miscellaneous Grains</p>
<p>Rose in unison. Soybeans rose by 200,000 yuan. The initial price of second-rate Za Beans was 3.35 million, and the final price of high-quality goods was 3.5 million yuan. Green beans and broad beans both rose by 100,000 yuan. There were not many transactions of red sorghum. New yuan wheat had fallen for several days, but yesterday it also rose by 200,000 yuan. Northerners snapped up corn at low prices, and the price rose by as much as 400,000 yuan. Red beans also rose by 400,000 yuan. There were not many buyers of sesame seeds. Raw peanuts have not been priced because the payment date has not been resolved.</p>
<p>Cooking Oil</p>
<p>Factories opened at very high prices due to rising raw material prices, coupled with loose money and large demand. Ultimately, the high opening prices led to retail investors selling, resulting in a price decline at the close. Dayou soybean oil opened at 16.2 million in the morning, and then closed at 15.65 million, rising by 5-600,000 yuan. Jiyutong raw oil was 19 million, and small cart sesame oil was the same price, each rising by 500,000 yuan. Driven by public sentiment, the price of soybean cake reached as high as 1.7 million, but retreated by 20,000 at the close.</p>
<h3>上海区本月转口粉　粮部准四十五万袋</h3>
<p>Regarding the Shanghai Flour Association's application to the Ministry of Food for permission to increase the amount of flour factories to be transferred for export, the Ministry of Food has now approved a total of 450,000 bags of leftover flour from Shanghai flour factories to be transferred for export this month, of which 400,000 bags will be shipped to North China, including 60,000 bags each to Beiping, Tianjin, and Qingdao, 20,000 bags to Yantai, 100,000 bags to Kailuan Coal Mine, 40,000 bags to Baoding, and 60,000 bags to the Pingjin Railway Bureau. 50,000 bags will be shipped to South China, including 20,000 bags to Shantou, 10,000 bags to Xiamen, 10,000 bags to Fuzhou, and 10,000 bags to Quanzhou. The price will be handled according to the China Trust Bureau's purchase price of flour, and the goods must be shipped before June 30. Expired goods will be canceled and Shanghai grain merchants will be designated to handle them separately. Flour transferred to the north is No. 3 and 4 flour, and flour transferred to the south is No. 1 and 2 flour.</p>
<h3>锡茧超出限价</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper from Wuxi, 3rd] The silkworm cocoon markets in various townships have now opened, but most are exceeding the price limit. The Association has decided that starting from the 4th, loans will be suspended for all cocoon markets that exceed the price limit of 26 million.</p>
<h3>各地商情</h3>
<p>Local Market Conditions</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper from Wuxi, 3rd] The silkworm cocoon market opened today. The National Bank is making large-scale purchases, so money is extremely tight and prices are firm at first and then weak. White japonica rice is 6.72 million yuan, white yuan is 6.82 million yuan, sheep xian is 6.6 million yuan, port xian is 6.46 million yuan, wheat is 5.4 million yuan, white wheat is 5.6 million yuan, new wheat is 4.5 million yuan, flour is 1.95 million yuan, soybean oil is 14.23 million yuan, and cotton yarn is 215 million yuan.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper from Suzhou, 3rd] Rice prices in Suzhou continued to rise today. The market price of coarse japonica rice was 5.92 million yuan, and the price of high-quality white japonica rice was 6.72 million yuan. The negotiated price of high-quality white rice sold at stores was 6.77 million yuan. In addition, the Suzhou County Government decided to withdraw 2,300 shi of accumulated grain and sell it on the market in batches to distribute the education expenses for May, which is expected to cause the rice price to fall slightly.</p>
<h3>收兑东北流通券　每人限额五千万</h3>
<p>Regarding the redemption of Northeast circulation certificates, the Central Bank has officially received the order from the Ministry of Finance, and the National Bank has notified its branches in various places to redeem them at the newly set exchange rate of 11.5 yuan, effective immediately. However, there are considerable restrictions, that is, the amount of redemption per person is limited to 50 million yuan in legal tender. For remittances from the Northeast, the limit is 200 million yuan in legal tender. Those exceeding these regulations must apply to the local Central Bank. The Shanghai National Bank has not yet received redemptions from citizens because the redemption has just begun.</p>
<h3>对实施外汇管理新办法　央行与输管会发表声明</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Recently, some members of the press have views that differ from the actual situation regarding the relationship between the government's implementation of foreign exchange management measures since August 18 last year and export trade, and the Central Bank and the Export-Import Management Committee's Circular No. 131. The Central Bank and the Export-Import Management Committee jointly issued a statement yesterday, the gist of which is: (1) Since the establishment of the Foreign Exchange Stabilization Fund Committee in August of last year, the adoption of a flexible exchange rate has been very successful in promoting exports and increasing foreign exchange income. Foreign exchange income from exports in March and April of this year is still far above the average figures for July and August of last year, so there is absolutely no fact of suppressing exports.</p>
<p>(2) Since February of this year, the Central Bank has known that the flexible adjustment of exchange rates is a relatively reasonable and effective method for the current situation, and the various obstacles that prevent it from exerting its effectiveness must be addressed comprehensively. Therefore, it began to study several plans to improve foreign exchange management methods, and the recently announced foreign exchange settlement certificate method is one of the three methods proposed. Before comprehensively improving the situation, the No. 131 method was temporarily used as a relief measure. This method was of a transitional nature when it was adopted, so it should be canceled according to the original plan on the date the new foreign exchange settlement method is officially implemented, which has nothing to do with personnel changes.</p>
<h3>Easing of Credit and Cheerful Sentiment: Cotton Yarn and Cloth Continue to Rise, Blue Phoenix Fine Yarn Increases by Another 10 Million Yuan</h3>
<p>Yesterday's cotton yarn market saw a loosening of credit and optimistic sentiment. Merchants from Tianjin, Guangdong, and other regions continued to procure actively, and large firms also came to buy. The 42-count Blue Phoenix fine yarn opened at 11.1 million yuan, with brisk trading. It closed at 314 million yuan, a further increase of 10 million yuan from the previous day. Other counts of coarse and fine yarns also rose by varying amounts, from 5.6 million to 13.14 million yuan, compared to the previous day.</p>
<p>Yesterday's cotton cloth market saw yarn prices rising, and merchants remained keen to buy. The 12-pound "Dragon Head" fine cloth initially rose by 280,000 yuan upon opening. Subsequently, due to competition from local traders and individual buyers, it climbed to 7.25 million yuan, reaching a high of 290,000 yuan. Later, as traders took profits by selling, the market price fell to 7.15 million yuan. After 10 o'clock, with the "Spinning and Construction" brand suspended, only mid-to-low-grade fine cloths were offered, and sentiment improved. "Dragon Head" cloth ultimately closed at 7.22 million yuan, a further increase of 320,000 yuan from the previous day. Other grades of fine cloth, as well as coarse cloth, bleached cloth, colored cloth, and Shilin cloth, all saw uniform price increases ranging from 120,000 to 450,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>Strengthening Control of Raw Cotton, Strict Procedures for Transport Permits</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Previously, the Yarn Control Committee, in order to strengthen the control of raw cotton, prevent merchants from privately buying and selling, and raising market prices, specifically stipulated that domestic cotton transportation should be based on the committee's cotton transportation permit. The movement of cotton in the Shanghai market should be based on the cotton movement permit. Since the implementation of these measures, most manufacturers have complied and followed them. However, due to unfamiliarity with the procedures, or perhaps seeking convenience, some deliberately try to take chances and smuggle. Considering that it was the initial stage of implementation, the committee did not want to strictly enforce the law. Now that time has passed, and it concerns the unified purchase, negligence can no longer be tolerated. Yesterday, it issued another earnest announcement that all cotton arriving in Shanghai must apply to the committee for a movement permit before it can be moved to storage facilities, factories, and warehouses. Railway station, pier and warehouse can admit cotton only with a transportation permit. From the date of this announcement, if anyone violates this again, the committee will impose penalties in accordance with the regulations.</p>
<h3>Settlement Certificates: Business and Industry Suggest Establishing an Open Market</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The selling price of settlement certificates yesterday was 360,000 yuan per U.S. dollar, with a difference of 834,000 yuan from the official rate, which was lower than the previous day. It is heard that business and industry figures are paying close attention to the transfer of settlement certificates. In order to avoid manipulation by powerful individuals, they suggest that the relevant authorities establish an open market, recognize the market for settlement certificates, and assist in transactions between buyers and sellers. Furthermore, since the implementation of the new settlement measures, the prices of exported materials have surged by 25% to 40% within a few days, clearly indicating manipulation. It is heard that the Export Control Committee is paying close attention to this.</p>
<h3>Handling of Overseas Remittances Still Requires Detailed Study</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] It is reported that after the implementation of the new settlement measures, the handling of overseas remittances, after discussion by the Overseas Remittances Subcommittee, has been decided in principle to also issue settlement certificates for overseas remittances. However, most of the remittance receiving locations are in Guangdong and Guangxi, and due to the vastness of the region, many technical issues are involved. The authorities have decided to further study this matter.</p>
<h3>Limited Fluctuations in Chinese Stocks, Active Trading in Unified Bonds</h3>
<p>Chinese stocks fluctuated slightly yesterday. Large investors acted secretively, making the process very unstable. The public was inevitably anxious, showing signs of weakness and fatigue. The decision to increase capital for China Silk actually caused it to fall to the limit.</p>
<p>At the morning opening, stocks already showed weakness. Wing On Spinning opened at 2,860 yuan, but was sold down to 2,830 yuan, before rising to 2,900 yuan, due to the stability of prices outside the stock market. Agency fees opened at the original price, but large investors secretly bought and sold, causing the price to fall to a low of 2,775 yuan. It closed at 2,790 yuan at noon. Compared to the previous close, China Silk fell to the limit before recovering slightly, while Wah Feng, American Asia, Sino-British, New Light, New China, King Fook, and Commercial Press fell by half a percent, and the rest experienced slight declines.</p>
<p>In the afternoon market, Wing On Spinning opened at 2,840 yuan. National banks did not make significant moves, and it rebounded to 2,880 yuan. Subsequently, amidst profit-taking, it was sold down to 2,795 yuan, closing at 2,800 yuan. Compared to the morning close, Wing On Spinning, Wah Feng, Zhabei, China Silk, Wing Feng, and Tongyi rose slightly. Sino-French, Sino-British, Match, Keen Hing, Underwear, and Wing On Fair remained unchanged, while the rest experienced slight declines. Off-market, unlisted stocks, especially bank stocks, were the most popular, rising by half a percent.</p>
<p>Yesterday's fluctuations were even more limited. With one day less to go, and excess liquidity, the results were all minor. Class A bonds fluctuated between 74.12 yuan, and Class B bonds only traded at 74.8 yuan.</p>
<p>Government Bonds</p>
<p>Government bonds gradually strengthened yesterday. Mixed bonds were actively traded. Unified Class C bonds started at 259,000 and gradually rose to 281,000 before turning around. Compared to the previous close, Classes A, B, C, and E each rose by 14,000, and Unified Class D rose strongly by 16,000.</p>
<p>Foreign Stocks</p>
<p>Yesterday, the market was generally weak except for Ye Kwong, which was popular with the Hong Kong and Guangdong investors. Ewo Spinning opened at 4.48 million, and gradually fell to close around 4.35 million. Trading was limited. As a result, compared to the previous close, British and Allied Aviation fell by half a percent, while Ye Kwong rose sharply by half a percent. Ewo Spinning, Paper, Steel, and Ewo Jute all reported small declines.</p>
<h3>Bank Inflows and Outflows, Liquidity Remains Loose</h3>

<p>New Medicine and New Drugs</p>
<h3>Advocating for "Domestically Produced Western Medicine"</h3>
<p>— Liang Junqing</p>
<p>We doctors often hear criticisms in casual gatherings about the "domestically produced Western medicine" being poorly made, causing delays in patient care, with the implication that "the finished products are inferior and not worth considering." In fact, this kind of misconception is unacceptable. If we allow such misleading and distorted views to continue to develop, it will not only mean that our country's Western medicine industry will never have a chance to rise, but also, in terms of foreign exchange, our country will truly lose an unknown amount economically each year—</p>
<p>Of course, most imported Western medicines have gone through countless experts' painstaking research and practical clinical trials before the finished products are released, so in terms of quality and effectiveness, they should definitely be welcomed and used by us. However, I must also honestly tell the readers that although imported Western medicines are very effective and easily gain the trust of our people, there are also quite a few poorly made and immature medicines among them (especially those shipped in after the victory of the Anti-Japanese War). Moreover, Western medicines often come with various side effects, and if not handled properly, they can easily harm patients. Therefore, imported Western medicines are not absolutely perfect and reliable, and it depends on the careful selection of our doctors when using them. As for "domestically produced Western medicines," although the equipment and manufacturing may be somewhat rudimentary, the effectiveness of the common medicines among them is really not inferior to imported products. For example, the most frequently used intravenous glucose injections cost about 600,000 yuan per ampoule for imported products, while domestic products cost around 100,000 yuan. With such a huge price difference for the same effectiveness, shouldn't we advocate for domestically produced Western medicines for the sake of the patients' finances and the country's losses in foreign exchange—</p>
<p>Moreover, in this chaotic world of impoverished people and depleted resources, the prices of imported Western medicines are rising day by day due to foreign exchange issues, not only leaving our poor patients with no way to buy them and waiting for death, but even middle-class families find it difficult to scrape together enough money. Even if they sell their belongings and borrow money to barely manage, their family property will be empty, and how will they live in the future? I often think to myself, why talk about using economic aggression policies to destroy our country? Even imported Western medicine alone is enough to exploit the Chinese people until they are drained of blood and resources. Many short-sighted compatriots think that they are setting up many hospitals for us out of charity and to help the poor and sick (Western medicine merchants from small countries like Switzerland are even more extreme, simply not engaging in any hypocritical charity work and only knowing how to raise prices every day). But who knows that this is just a sugar coating on a bitter pill.</p>
<p>This spring, the author attended the National Physicians' Association Joint Congress in Nanjing and was honored with a joint banquet by domestic Western medicine merchants. At the banquet, Dr. Yang Shuxun, director of the Yang's Chemical Research Institute, gave a speech, recounting the suffering of the people due to the lack of Western medicine during the Anti-Japanese War and the difficulties in the development of the domestic Western medicine industry. He also pointed out the current tense international situation and the possibility of a third world war. He hoped that our people could prepare in time and not repeat the mistakes of the past. His words were mournful and full of pain. Unfortunately, his voice was weak and had little effect. Everyone only cares about immediate interests, and who pays attention to those more far-sighted things?</p>
<p>To be honest, if our doctors and patients can pay attention to and cherish "domestically produced Western medicine," and everyone vigorously advocates its use (starting with selecting reliable domestic products from the most commonly used Western medicines and promoting their widespread use), then domestic Western medicine will definitely develop, improve, and become more perfect day by day. If we continue to develop in the future, we may have a day when we can sell domestically produced Western medicine to foreign countries!</p>
<p>"Nothing is difficult in the world for those who set their minds on it." I hereby wish "domestically produced Western medicine" a limitless future!</p>
<h3>Editor's Note</h3>
<p>Although the manuscripts in this issue are all theoretical, because they discuss matters that are directly related to doctors and the public, we have specially compiled them and published them in this issue. We hope that readers will not find them too dry and boring!</p>
<p>Dr. Huang Mingju is a senior figure in the academic community. He and Dr. Huang Wurong are brothers and have been famous in the academic field for decades.</p>
<p>Dr. Su Huixiang is a female doctor who studied in Hamburg, Germany, in her early years. Although her article in this issue is written in a rambling style, it is full of a sense of justice. I hope that our medical community, as she said, will do more work in their respective positions, so that "you reap what you sow," and the result will ultimately be good. Otherwise, even if the result is not necessarily a complete disgrace, being abandoned by everyone will make one feel guilty forever.</p>
<p>Many readers write letters asking about illnesses, but do not include sufficient postage and address. Of course, we will not respond to such letters. To be honest, it costs several hundred thousand yuan for a doctor to see one outpatient case now, and now we have to specially take time to answer thousands of questions, is it still okay to ask them to pay the postage?</p>
<p>The next issue will have a very important article on the treatment of tuberculosis, please pay attention to it. We hereby announce in advance.</p>
<h3>Casual Notes from Chunxiao Building Clinic</h3>
<p>— Su Zengxiang</p>
<p>Recently, Mr. Hu Shi wrote a small screen for me, on which he wrote "You reap what you sow." When I read these two idioms, they not only express a kind of expectation, but also contain a kind of warning.</p>
<p>For doctors, they work diligently throughout the year and, in addition to treating diseases, must also study how to prevent diseases; they do not treat human life as child's play, nor do they aim at making profits. Doctors who sow good causes will bring good results to patients.</p>
<p>For patients, they should listen to the doctor's instructions as much as possible, cooperate with the doctor, and know that nursing is more important than medicine; they should make good use of air, sunlight, and nutrition, and not do anything useless, so that diseases can be easily cured. This means that patients who sow good causes will reap good results for themselves and bring success to doctors.</p>
<p>Looking at the general situation of society, whether it is industry or commerce, if they value profit over righteousness, hoard goods for speculation, produce shoddy goods, only seek market increases, and do not care about the people's livelihood; over time, the social economy will collapse, which will affect personal reputation on a small scale and mislead the country's future on a large scale. This is sowing bad causes and will inevitably lead to bad results.</p>
<p>Moreover, the way of dealing with the world is no exception. Destroying one's personality and seeking success by chance will inevitably lead to disgrace and ruin once one is abandoned by the public. This is also sowing bad causes and will inevitably lead to bad results.</p>
<p>As the hot summer is approaching, if people eat raw, cold, and dirty things at will, without restraint, and without seeking cleanliness, diseases such as fever, diarrhea, cholera, typhoid fever, and epidemics will follow, which will cause harm to the body on a small scale and loss of life on a large scale. This is also sowing bad causes and will inevitably lead to bad results.</p>
<p>In this world, you can only reap melons from sowing melons, and you can only reap beans from sowing beans. This is not superstition, but science. People who have received higher education should be aware of this and warn themselves!</p>
<h3>On Pharmaceutical Education (Part 1)</h3>
<p>— Huang Mingju</p>
<p>More than two years have passed since the victory of the Anti-Japanese War. The glory of being one of the four powers seems to have gradually faded. In this situation where people are competing for resources and striving to apply atomic bombs, if we do not seize the opportunity and move forward to engage in scientific construction, not only will the term "one of the four powers" disappear forever, but the survival of the entire country may be threatened.</p>
<p>After the victory, the call for building the country has been very loud, both in the government and among the people. However, nation-building requires talents. Do we have enough talents? We won't look at anything else, but just look at the work of taking over the recovered areas in the past two years. We have already felt that there is a lack of talents. How can we talk about nation-building? Therefore, to talk about nation-building, we need science. To develop science, we must recruit talents. If there are not enough talents, we must cultivate them. This is an unbreakable conclusion at present and must be worked towards diligently.</p>
<p>The scope of science is very broad. To move it forward, it must be moved forward in an all-round way. It is absolutely impossible to hope for success by focusing on one aspect alone or being biased towards one aspect. For example, in the early years of the Republic of China, it was felt that natural science was too poor, so the government sent people to study abroad, focusing on natural science. Later, it was felt that the political situation was chaotic and could not be governed, so the government later sent people to study abroad, focusing on political and economic disciplines. As a result, science lagged behind and never recovered. Therefore, the current trend is to focus on natural science again. In fact, this kind of measure is somewhat lacking. We must know that all kinds of undertakings in the world contain science, which must be coordinated and advanced simultaneously, and must not be neglected.</p>
<p>As far as pharmaceutical education is concerned, it can be said that there has been no achievement in decades. Although a few people have loudly called for the establishment of pharmaceutical education, there has been no response. Before the Anti-Japanese War, our pharmacy was backward, and most people did not realize it, because European and American countries were constantly inventing new drugs, which were cheap, effective, and continuously dumped into the country. We could use them conveniently, and we never felt that there would be pain in the future. The so-called industrial and commercial decline and national leaks were not seen by anyone, and no one thought about it. Even if a few people saw it, thought about it, and shouted loudly, it was useless. Decades have passed in this kind of inertia.</p>
<p>After the Anti-Japanese War, the sea routes were blocked, the source of new drugs was cut off, and the drug shortage reached an extreme level. The value of Western medicine naturally skyrocketed. Even if the people had the ability to see a doctor, they had no ability to buy medicine and could only wait for death. Under this situation, although we have not counted the number of people who sacrificed their lives, I am afraid that the number must be quite large. During the Anti-Japanese War, it can be said that everyone felt the direct and personal pain of not being able to supply their own medicines and the backwardness of pharmacy. Everyone should feel it and should develop pharmaceutical education as soon as possible to cultivate advanced pharmaceutical talents in order to achieve self-sufficiency in medicines. However, in recent years, the drug shortage has only become more serious. Everyone has been running around calling for help, but they have only talked about how to relieve the drug shortage, and have never talked about remedying the lack of pharmaceutical talents and the fundamental problem of the backwardness of pharmaceutical education. Those in charge of pharmaceutical education seem to have heard nothing and felt nothing. After carefully analyzing the reasons for this phenomenon, they are generally no more than the following points.</p>
<p>(1) No distinction between medicine and pharmacy</p>
<p>(2) Disordered system</p>
<p>(3) Wrong point of view</p>
<p>Regarding the first point, because in our country since ancient times, medicine and pharmacy have not been separated. Those who know medicine should know pharmacy. Those who know pharmacy can practice medicine. Until now, everyone still has this concept. Therefore, it is believed that pharmaceutical education is also the responsibility of medical personnel. In fact, medicine and pharmacy are two completely different subjects. In ancient times, doctors dispensed medicines and pharmacists could handle medical formulas. This phenomenon was also the case in Europe before it was civilized. Later, when science developed, the boundaries between medicine and pharmacy had to be separated, because medicine is the study of pathology and treatment, and its basic sciences are important, such as anatomy, pathology, and physiology; pharmacy is the study of the manufacture, structure, and chemical testing of drugs, and its basic sciences are important, such as chemistry, botany, crude drugs, and analysis. From the perspective of the basic science subjects, it can be seen that these two are completely different sciences and should never be confused. The only close relationship between medicine and pharmacy is that the manufactured drugs must be tested by doctors. However, it is absolutely impossible to assign all problems to the hands of doctors just because they need to be tested, and all education problems must also be their responsibility. Its error is really laughable. For example, agricultural students grow many crops and call chefs to test them to distinguish their advantages and disadvantages, but they cannot say that chefs know how to plant crops, or even call them to manage agricultural undertakings. Its error is the same as not being able to distinguish the difference between medicine and pharmacy. Of course, doctors must have a deep understanding of the properties and pharmacology of drugs. However, these are all aspects of drug application, and not manufacturing. Therefore, the mistaken concept that medicine is pharmacy and pharmacy is medicine is the crux of why pharmaceutical education is not valued and cannot develop steadily.

<h3>Democracy and the Rule of Law</h3>
<p>— Jingwen</p>
<p>Talking about democracy seems to be the most popular thing nowadays. Political journals are full of such articles, and even general comprehensive or literary journals always have one or two articles on democracy as a decoration. This should be a natural and good phenomenon in our country at the beginning of constitutional rule. We not only do not think there are too many, but we feel there are too few. Just think, the representatives of the National Assembly still need a copy of "Preliminary Steps in Democracy" in hand, which is enough to show that democratic knowledge in our country is still far from being widespread and in-depth.</p>
<p>This is naturally because the implementation of democracy must develop in parallel with the intelligence of the people. "The people can be made to follow it, but not made to understand it" is a means of blocking the people's intelligence in the autocratic era. Therefore, the initial stage of democracy must start with how to "make them understand it." Because although democracy can be explained in thousands of ways, it can be summarized as everyone being able to exercise their free will. The reason why democracy is inevitably linked to the word freedom is the same.</p>
<p>However, the exercise of free will must have a certain degree of public intelligence as a relative condition. Because free will without proper judgment can often become a dangerous thing. Just imagine what kind of situation this world would become if everyone acted according to their own so-called free will? Therefore, democratic countries must strictly implement the rule of law; to a certain extent, the rule of law should be said to be a constraint on individual free will, but in fact, everyone knows that only a strict rule of law is truly a reliable guarantee of freedom and democracy. The so-called rule of law is that the degree of public intelligence of a country has been able to weigh the sacrifice of a part of individual freedom in exchange for the freedom of all members of society.</p>
<p>The Three Principles of the People once criticized that the Chinese people have scattered sand-like freedom, but lack the cohesion of cement. This is because all the freedom we have is too scattered. The English phrase "free-for-all" directly translates to everyone being free to act. We have recently become accustomed to this kind of freedom, such as fighting on trams, fighting in theaters, and group fights among students, etc., all of which can be attributed to this kind of freedom. But on the contrary, it only proves that our degree of public intelligence is still far from being able to talk about the rule of law.</p>
<p>Many people who are dissatisfied with the status quo believe that we cannot talk about the rule of law today. Whoever has power, whoever has money, stands in the upper hand of "rule," and the law seems to be a barrier set up for these people. There is no justice in society, and there is no justice in the world. How can we talk about the rule of law? According to reports, a theater in Changzhou was banned from performing because it changed the plaque "The country is governed by law" in the courtroom scene of the play "The Tragic Death of Chu Fengdi" to "The country is governed by currency," which is enough to prove how disappointed people are with the rule of law.</p>
<p>It is undeniable that social phenomena are disappointing. However, negative sarcasm and even despair do not help to change the social atmosphere. Thinking that the rule of law is impossible and that abiding by the law is tantamount to restricting oneself can only be said to be a biased view. The so-called democratic spirit is to require everyone to have the spirit of striving for the rule of law, that is, to strive for freedom and security through legal channels. The reason why democratic revolution is different from violent revolution is that the former emphasizes the procedures of law and reason, and its process is gradual; while the latter often results in replacing violence with violence.</p>
<p>In an unreasonable society, it is a difficult problem to realize the rule of law, but it is a truly fighting spirit for democracy to know that it is impossible and still want to do it. In the previous period, a lawyer filed a lawsuit against the post office's behavior of adding overdue payments because the post office increased prices without being approved by the Legislative Yuan. At that time, it was only a small matter of several thousand dollars, and the lawyer knew that the price increase had been approved by the administrative authorities, although it had not gone through legal procedures, but it was already impossible to do anything, but he still wanted to do it. This is a democratic action to strive for the rule of law. Although the result of this action was a failure, the influence of its spirit is quite valuable.</p>
<p>Although the meaning of the rule of law does not lie in encouraging people to file lawsuits, in order to protect the interests of individuals or society, everyone should know how to use legal channels to uphold justice. On the contrary, everyone should also restrain individual free will and actions to fulfill their responsibilities to society. Although the constitution has been implemented, there is still a long way to go before realizing true democracy. Whether this road can be passed smoothly depends on whether our level of public intelligence can distinguish between individual freedom and the freedom of members of society, that is, whether everyone can respect the spirit of the rule of law. I do not agree with the so-called democracy that replaces violence with violence, and at the same time I oppose scattered sand-like freedom, and I believe that only democracy based on the rule of law is true democracy.</p>
<h3>Breaking Superstition</h3>
<p>— Jimo</p>
<p>There are many people who often feel uneasy because they have nightmares at night, such as being trapped in mud, groping in the dark, chasing trains but never being able to board them; or when they are awake, they accidentally break bowls, cups, or mirrors. I recently learned that even not seeing the coffin in a big funeral is a sign of a small misfortune.</p>
<p>Since Westernization spread to the East, it has brought a lot of new scientific knowledge, but at the same time, it has also introduced some new superstitions. Buying a numbered ticket with the number thirteen, or being forced to pass under a ladder on the road because of crowded pedestrians, more or less makes people feel a little uncomfortable. The troubles and stressful life on the road of life have already made people suffer enough, and adding so many superstitions makes them even more psychologically constrained.</p>
<p>If we spare no effort to compensate for the shortcomings in our material enjoyment, we should also try to get rid of the shackles in our spiritual life. It is said that the contemporary American novelist Sinclair Lewis (the one who won the Nobel Prize money of more than 40,000 yuan, not Upton Sinclair who wrote The Coal King and Boston, etc.) is also a radical element who breaks superstition. Once, when he was invited by a certain revival meeting to attend and give a speech, after denouncing the absurd rumor that a certain free-thinking person was killed by God, he shouted loudly, "I am willing to dedicate myself as a test subject, please God kill me in ten minutes—" For a time, the listeners of the sermon were in an uproar and left their seats one after another.</p>
<p>Originally, the fear of superstition lies in making people feel depressed and feel a certain omen, and developing a fear of the future. It blocks sound thinking and understanding, and is a stumbling block for anyone to make progress. I have witnessed an architect who, after completing the design of a certain project, suddenly trembled his fingers when he picked up a pen to write, hesitated, and finally abandoned his engineering plan, along with delaying the date of his fame in one fell swoop.</p>
<p>Logically, if there is an unlucky omen, there is a possibility that an unfortunate event will occur. Then, before a real disaster or accident comes, there must also be a sign before it can make sense. I remember one year at the end of the year, the author took the Shanghai-Nanjing train from Suzhou to Shanghai. When the train entered Shanghai Station, it collided with another locomotive, and many people were killed or injured. The author was in the last few carriages of the train. Although he was shaken, he was fortunately not injured. However, on the day of the accident, the weather was unusually sunny, and the people in the car were talking and laughing. Until the last few minutes of entering the station, there was not a trace of the slightest sign of misfortune.</p>
<h3>Natural Disaster?</h3>
<p>— Haiyan</p>
<p>Not long ago, there was a big fire in Chongqing that lasted for five hours, and it took only more than ten minutes from a spark to a raging fire.</p>
<p>Chongqing is the most difficult place to put out fires. Often, far from the road, turning two corners, the slope of the stone steps is too steep, and the power of the water dragon is not easy to reach. Some roads are not like this. The water dragon arrives in an instant, but the firefighters are helpless. Ten thousand people watch from across the river, only having the share of sighing.</p>
<p>The reason? The reason is that there is no tap water, and the water can be transported by land. Firefighting can only be done with dry equipment in an emergency. So, more than a hundred houses were watched as they turned to ashes.</p>
<p>When houses burn down, fatalistic Chinese people have always called it "natural disaster." The bewildered crows in the fire, circling around because they are lost, reflecting the firelight and transforming into golden wings, are called "fire crows," which are sent by the Fire God to preside over the disaster. After being burned, they also have to perform a fire ritual to reward the gods, otherwise they will come again to wreak havoc. In short, the passers-by watching the fire mostly sigh in unison, "It's God's will!"</p>
<p>Is it really God's will? There is no tap water.</p>
<p>China's science is backward, and there are not enough public disaster prevention facilities, so there is no way to do it. But in Chongqing, several air force members watching the fire said, "If we had an order to fly two planes and drop some sand, it would be extinguished immediately, but without an order, there is nothing we can do."</p>
<p>Floods are also not a small matter. Even if airplanes are dispatched to help with disaster relief, it is not an exaggeration, because it is related to the lives and property of three thousand people after all.</p>
<p>However, not to mention airplanes, the most common and convenient tap water cannot be used. Is the lack of tap water due to the Lunshui injuring people, or other reasons? There is no need to investigate further. In short, the fact that there are no fully utilized facilities is undeniable.</p>
<p>The fate of the Chinese people is always in the hands of the Old Man of Heaven and the Fire Crow. This shows that we are still stagnating in a stupid and backward era, and there is no major difference from before and after the Boxer Rebellion.</p>
<p>We don't need to talk about new scientific construction. Being able to smoothly obtain the tap water equipment from twenty years ago is already a supreme blessing.</p>
<h3>Qian Juntao, Xu Ju'an: Preface to the Epigraphy, Calligraphy, and Painting Exhibition</h3>
<p>— Feng Zikai</p>
<p>Juntao and Ju'an will be holding an exhibition of epigraphy, calligraphy, and painting at the China National Products Company starting June 4th. When I was in Shanghai to see Mei Lanfang's play, Juntao told me about this news and asked me to write a preface. Recently, the world is full of wars, which makes me feel more affectionate towards "art," which symbolizes peace and happiness. I came to see Mr. Mei's play with great sincerity, and now I hear this news, which feels like icing on the cake. I am happy to write a preface.</p>
<p>Juntao was originally a design expert, and his designs are unique. During the eight years of the Anti-Japanese War, he devoted himself to the study of epigraphy, which allowed his talents to surpass design and develop towards calligraphy and painting. Today, epigraphy, calligraphy, and painting have all progressed equally, which can be called "three perfections." There is an ancient Chinese saying that "calligraphy and painting share the same origin." In fact, this saying is not entirely correct. It should be said that "epigraphy, calligraphy, and painting share the same origin," three in one. And in terms of their order, epigraphy is the eldest brother, calligraphy is the second brother, and painting is the third brother. A disciple of Wu Changshuo told me: Wu Changshuo said in his later years: "People say I am good at painting, but in fact, my calligraphy is better than my painting; people say I am good at calligraphy, but in fact, my epigraphy is even better than my calligraphy." This is true! Wu was proficient in calligraphy because he was proficient in epigraphy; he was able to paint because he was proficient in calligraphy. Epigraphy, calligraphy, and painting are three in one, and epigraphy is the eldest brother among the three, which can be confirmed. Now, Juntao's learning started with epigraphy, with a clear source, from top to bottom, from root to branch, from inside to outside, from deep to shallow. No wonder his calligraphy and painting have progressed by leaps and bounds, and finally, the three talents are flourishing together.</p>
<p>Ju'an and Juntao are artists with the same style. When discussing Juntao, it is also appropriate to discuss Ju'an. And I particularly love his ancient costume figures, which are modeled after Fei Xiaolou, but surpass him. The charm of the appearance, the exquisiteness of the lines, and the appropriateness of the layout are all so endearing! I myself have never painted ancient costume figures. Half is habit, half is because I dislike the ugliness of most ancient costume figure paintings: the bodies of the women are often not physiological, with disproportionate development of various parts, or even disabled. As for the men, I dislike them because they look like Taoist priests. Ju'an does not paint "Taoist priests" but specializes in female figures, and the female bodies he paints are all anatomically correct, with beautiful faces and graceful figures, resembling Mei Lanfang in "Celestial Maiden Scattering Flowers" and "Goddess of the Luo River." That's why I love them so much! I already have many of Juntao's works, but I haven't acquired any of Ju'an's yet. Someday I will ask him for a painting of an ancient costume beauty to hang in my room, as if I see Dr. Mei every day. This does not look like a preface, so let's just consider it as one. (Written in Hangzhou, May 12, 1937.)</p>
<h3>Qian Jun Dian's Seal Carving</h3>
<h3>Forgetfulness</h3>
<p>— Mei Bai</p>
<p>One day, the famous actress Hedy Lamarr and the famous writer He Quetuo went to visit the Hollywood movie mogul Squillronberg. They arrived on time at the appointed hour. Squillronberg himself opened the door and invited them inside. He said that he had some things to finish and asked the two guests to sit for a while and he would be right back. After saying that, he hurried upstairs and left.</p>
<p>The two guests waited for an hour, but the host still did not come down. He Quetuo whispered to Miss Lamarr: "I'm afraid he went upstairs and forgot about us, maybe he's taking a nap. Let's come back again."</p>
<p>Miss Lamarr happily agreed. So they ran out the door and rang the doorbell again. Squillronberg himself came to open the door and invited them inside. He Quetuo said first: "Sorry, we are a little late." Squillronberg said earnestly: "It's alright, it's alright, I've been waiting for you two for a long time." So Hedy Lamarr and He Quetuo happily talked business with Squillronberg—without mentioning that they had already been there before.</p>
<p>###</p>
<p>Society is abnormal, and strange news emerges one after another. Last week, there was a strange incident in Tianjin. The wife of a judge sent a vest to a dry cleaner and later discovered that gold ingots, diamonds, U.S. dollars, treasures, etc., were sewn into the hem of the garment. Half of them were lost, and the company refused to pay compensation, so they quarreled and went to court. This wife can be called a truly unparalleled "gold-clad jade," and her wealth is boundless. However, the wonderful thing is not in her "wealth," but in her "fanciful imagination." I heard that when a Japanese noblewoman returned to her country the year before last, the Allied forces found countless gold and treasures sewn into the seams of her clothes, which she had hidden. Those who obtained them kept them privately. One really had to imitate the "clothing edict" of Emperor Xian of Han. But what was this Tianjin wife doing? This is the first unbelievable thing. According to past practice, whenever clothing is handed over to a cabinet for safekeeping or given to a store for cleaning, the receiver must first ask, "Are there any items in the pockets?" The owner either answers "no" or checks it himself and takes out anything he has. But this refers to pockets. If things are sewn into the clothing, the receiver has no way to ask, and the owner is also inconvenient to announce it. This Tianjin wife casually handed it over first, and then openly spoke of it later. This is the second unbelievable thing. The "clothing edict" of Emperor Xian of Han of the Three Kingdoms was discovered when Dong Cheng was watching the lights and the lamp exploded, burning a corner of the belt and revealing the blood edict hidden inside. In addition, there is a story in the Strange Tales of Ancient and Modern, in the case of Teng Dasheng judging family property. He accepted the complaint of Mrs. Mei and only presented the painting scroll left by her deceased husband. The county magistrate looked at the picture and was not very clear about it. Coincidentally, the tea servant delivered tea, and a drop of tea wet a corner of the scroll, revealing words in the inner layer. Upon careful inspection under the light, the entire will distributing the family property was revealed. He judged and concluded the case based on this (details in the original novel, which will not be repeated here). The above are all stories of hiding and revealing secrets. But what was hidden were secret documents, not gold and jewels. The Tianjin woman's property was not smuggling, so why did she have to create such mystery? It is truly incomprehensible. Some say that it is because it is incomprehensible that it becomes modern news, and therefore there are too many incomprehensible strange things today...</p>
<p>Before he finished speaking, he saw a report that a National Assembly representative from Hunan was returning to Nanjing via Hankou with his family. His wife's handbag was stolen, and she lost three gold bars, one gold bowl, and gold jewelry and U.S. dollars worth about 40 to 50 billion. The wife even knew that the thief had followed her from Nanjing. What is surprising is not the "wealth" but the strangeness of the incident. Here, one can only sigh at the wonderful use of words in the ancient text "extravagant storage invites theft." The words "extravagant" and "invites" are both concise and profound. How can old literature be wrong?</p>
