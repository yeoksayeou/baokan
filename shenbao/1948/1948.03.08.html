<h3>走向民主之路　—三八國際婦女節獻</h3>
<p>今天是第三十八屆國際婦女節，也正是我國行憲後的第一屆婦女節。所謂國　婦女運動，一言以蔽之，就是婦女的參政運動，爭取男女在政治上經濟上的自由平等。所以今年的三八婦女節，在行憲時期的中國，格外値得我們重視。</p>
<p>紀念一年一度的節日，其要義乃在嚴謹檢討過去，自警自惕，俾來日更加緊工作，向着這一個崇高的共同的目標邁進。我們紀念婦女節的意義，也是要使全世界的婦女們，都能在這一夫檢討過去，惕勵來茲。大家都曉得國際婦女節的起源，遠在三十八年前的今天，美國芝加哥婦女們，爲了爭取婦女的解放，舉行一次廣大的示威遊行，高叫出男女在政治上經濟上平等的口號，過了一年，第二屆國際婦女代表大會在丹麥京城舉行，全塲一致決議，定「三八」爲國際婦女節，並提出了許多「同工同酬」·「保護母親」·「實行八小時工作制」的議案，於是從一九二年起，世界各國的婦女，每年逢到三月八日，都舉行紀念儀式。中國婦女比較落後，至一九二四年方開始舉行這富有時代意義的紀念，到現在也有二十五年的歷史了。</p>
<p>今天我們乘此節日，回溯一下四十年來國際婦女運動的成就。我們固不能言過其　，說過去的婦女運動是根本失敗，但我們也不容許誇大其詞，謂婦女參政運動今已達到了預定的目標。因爲從表面看，世界各國的憲法，莫不承認男女在法律上的平等，莫不規定婦女有參政權，尤其是我國新憲法規定各種選舉，婦女當選名額另以法律定之，並特別保證其當選名額不得少於總數百分之二十。可見婦女不僅巳與男子平等，且較男子爲優。但是按之實際，各國婦女參政的機會，以及其在政治上經濟上的地位，仍較男子尙遜一籌。就是在女權最發達的英美，婦女的地位還要靠婦女本身的繼續努力。造成這種情形的因素，固然不一而足，但是最重要的，實由於社會的傳統與婦女本身的問題所造成。尤其　　　　婦女，在全世界文明國家婦女的地位裏，　　　　其後。</p>
<p>我們當然不能否認中國婦女們對於抗戰勝利有過重大的貢獻，但因敎育的不普及，大多數婦女還是不識字，根本不知婦女參政運動爲何物。在都市的婦女們，今天雖能舉行集會熱烈紀念三八婦女節，但大多數的鄉村婦女，壓根兒不知道什麼叫做「三八婦女節」。她們所需要的，不是參政的權利，而是基本的生活與知識。所以今日中國婦女問題的本質，應該不是在於爭取法律上的平等，而在爭取實際上的男女平等。知識婦女在我國全國婦女之中，僅佔着一小部份。所以目前最基本的工作，首在普及婦女敎育，使她們覺醒，使她們能實際參政。</p>
<p>記得「三八婦女節」在我國開始的一年，國父孫中山先生曾向一般知識婦女演說，呼籲全國的女同胞澈底覺悟，協力團結，共同爲革命而努力·這一個神聖的昭示，在我國剛開始行憲的今日，對於全國的婦女們仍含着無窮盡的意義。中國民主政治的完成，有待全國人民的共同參加；中國婦女能否完全參政，實爲我國民主政治的一大考騐。我們希望今後的婦女參政運動，能滲入我國政治民主化運動，使這兩種運動合而爲一，同時達成我們預定的目標。今年是我國的憲政實施年，希望全國的女同胞步伐一致，走向民主之路。但是我國政治民主化目前最大的障碍，就是共匪的弄兵作亂，所以今天紀念三八婦女節，我們要特別强調婦女界參加戡亂建國工作的重要性。大家都應明瞭，共匪不除，國無寗日，則任何空談婦女參政運動，亦將感到無實際的意義可言！</p>
<h3>美軍事援華問題　國務院與軍人意見不同　外委會對援華案提出兩項課題</h3>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓七日電〕消息靈通方面七日稱：最近之發展，表示美國官方對援華之數量與種類意見上已發生極大之分裂，軍事領袖與國務院之分裂，已有目共覩，麥克阿瑟元帥及魏德邁將軍相繼向衆院外交委員會提供證詞，顯然深信必須以足够之軍事援助中國，始能完全將共軍驅出東北及華北，然至今尙無跡象表示國務院有意改變原來之立塲。國務院官員稱：除已發表之援華剩餘軍事配備外，無意更以戰具援助中國國民政府。</p>
<p>〔中央社華盛頓六日電〕美衆院外委會於上週討論國務院所提具有限制性之經濟援華方案時，曾集中力量，討論軍事援華，俾抗禦共黨之問題，而由於美高級將領麥克阿瑟將軍及魏德邁將軍之贊成，並力主以軍事援華，故外委會顯對此問題較對馬歇爾計劃大綱更爲注意。該會之十一名民主黨議員及十四名共和黨議員，在聽取各方對援華問題意見時，，渠等對中共是否威脅中國政府之存在，共黨如獲成功，則是否即等於蘇聯控制中國一問題，頗有歧見。該會對軍事援華問題，提出兩項重要問題：（一）中國國軍是否訓練有素，而能善於利用美國援助之物資？馬氏之答案爲「否。按渠係於年前蒞華，但若干力主軍事援華且在馬氏之後蒞華者，則堅信如美軍顧問團予中國國軍以適當訓練（按該國刻尙米獲准從事此項訓練），則中國軍隊，將極具此種能力，（二）中國究需何種軍事援助，美國如不積極在軍事方面參加中國防共之內戰，則美國援華之最大限度如何？此種軍事援助，至何時何種地步爲止？美國能供給中國之資源爲何，美國如不實際保證中國政府之政治及軍事之安全，則美國對中國問題將過問至何種程度？按上述諸問題，多係由民主黨議員提出。贊成軍事援華者，對此諸問題已作普遍之答復，謂中國除彈藥輾武器及其他若干設備外，所需之軍事援助甚微，美國可自其在太平洋島嶼剩餘物資中，取出上述各物、供應中國，而不影響美國國內之資源。至於美國牽涉入中國內戰問題，美陸軍部高級計劃官員魏德邁將軍，即已指出，美國不必參加中國之內戰，祗需予中國軍隊以武器。渠等即可完成任務。僉信一俟援華計劃前後草案擬就，參衆院開始正式辯論時，兩院對軍事援華與經濟援華計劃是否應合併之問題，即可加以討論。藍謨賽同意軍事援華</p>
<h3>魯克斯將出席　援華案審查會</h3>
<p>藍謨賽同意軍事援華</p>
<p>〔中央社華盛頓六日電〕據中央社記者今日獲悉：美衆院外委會對華援助審查會，於八日復會時，聯總署長魯克斯將出席申述意見，其他預定出席軍述意見者，有聯總中國分署長艾格敦，美前駐華大使高恩及進出口銀行理事會現任理事等。據國會人士方面稱，該委會於八日舉行秘密執行會議時，美聯邦情報局長希倫柯敦，將就援助方案方面，提供關於中國情勢之內幕情報。</p>
<p>〔中央社檀香山六日合衆社電〕美太平洋艦隊總司令藍謨賽，頃自遠東各軍事根據地作二週之遊歷後，返抵珍珠港，據稱，渠甚同意麥帥所稱「中國需要軍事及經濟兩方面之援助」一語，並謂，就目前國際情勢言，太平洋防務頗爲充實，「但情勢固非一成不變者」。</p>
<h3>翁文灝抵滬</h3>
<p>談資委會工作重點</p>
<p>為增加生產與輸出</p>
<p>〔本市訊〕資源委員會翁委員長文灝昨因公來滬，記者趨謁，叩詢資委會在各地經營事業情形，翁氏答稱：「重要消息，已在報紙隨時發表，可不復述，茲可爲奉吿者，資委會此時推進工作，特爲注重下列三點：</p>
<p>（一）爲增高物資生產，例如烟煤，長江各省俱有煤田，煤質優良，向因人工未盡，以致　量用途仰給於北方之煤，長途遠運，資委會現正在湖南江西二省選定煤礦數處，運裝發電抽水各項有關設備，增加產煤數量，以供急需，所有效果，現正遂月加多。又如鋼鐵，從前束北鞍山鋼鐵廠原爲最大產地，近因共匪攻擾，暫吿淪陷，資委會年來在北平產煤鐵，天津製鋼，已具有基礎，現在認眞出產，以供需用。華中華南產有鐵礦，質量均佳，因缺乏煤焦，尙未製煉，資委會當即爲建設，並與烟焦辦法同時並進，以期建立新的基礎。</p>
<p>（二）爲增高輸出貿易，資委會辦理鎢，銻，錫等鑛產出口，償債易貨，已歷多年，近來更有台灣食糖，產量增多，正在努力向日本及南洋等處大量推銷。又水泥首次向菲律賓輸出，已開始實行，國內產額迅速加多，故水泥出口之數址，亦即當更爲加大，以期對國際收支之平衡上，增多實質之貢獻。</p>
<p>（三）爲提高工礦事業之工作效力，吾國戰後物價工資坍漲甚多，以致生產成本亦增高特鉅，爲健全工業經濟起見，必須切實提高工作效率，期使生產之能力及數量得以提高，物料及人力的負担因以降低，資委會現正督責各單位，照此方向，認震用力。</p>

<p>〔法國新聞社白魯塞爾六日電〕與會人士方面之印象，以爲各方對於將來所訂條約之大概輪廓，已獲致一致之結論，唯最後簽訂條約之實際形式及法律措辭，尙待斟酌耳。條約之方式有三：（一）雙方協定；（二）英與荷比盧以及法與荷比盧簽訂四方協定；（三）由五强簽訂多方協定。此後一協定最能獲人擁護，因能包括多方面，而使大門向其他國家洞開也。該項條約將述及政治及經濟各方面，荷比盧數國對於經濟方面尤感重要。條約不包括軍事合作之具體方案在內，但將規定聯合防禦侵略之原則，一如「彼特羅波利斯」美利堅洲際條約。</p>
<p>〔路透社白魯塞爾六日電〕英大使館吿本社稱，英法荷比盧五國公約草案，雖未對軍事部份作細則規定，然共同防衛之原則正在討論之中。據接近與會代表團之人透露，荷比盧所提之備忘錄，將作爲五國公約之序論篇，條文則將採納英法草案及荷比盧草案中之各條彙集而成。又據可靠方面息，義大利參加西歐聯盟之問題，曾在今日之會議中討論，然悉義大利將於英法荷比盧五國簽約後始參加。</p>
<h3>貝文擬與西歐各國商討　謀擴大聯盟範圍　五國盟約短期內可簽字</h3>
<p>〔路透社倫敦七日電〕官方人士聲稱：貝文外相及皮杜爾外長，將於三月十五日歐洲十六國會議在巴黎召開之前　召開之後，前往比京簽訂五國西歐聯盟條約，現尙不能決定，當視現在比京集商之五國代表團是否得於下週中期完成協議的草約而定·西歐·約如得於巴黎十六國會議揭幕前完成，具有兩重利益，一可提出西歐決定幽結其政策及經濟力量之具體證據，一可使參加馬歇爾方案諸國獲有擴大西歐聯盟可能性之基礎。　觀察家確信貝文外相當利用十六國代表雲集巴黎之機會，與其中若干國之外長舉行非正式之會談，以聆取彼等對於西歐未來關係之意見。義外長福薩及瑞典外長恩登必將爲貝文希望其非正式討論擴大西歐聯盟可能性之人物。最近比京傳出消息，謂五國西歐聯盟條約將保持門戶之開放，使願意參加之任何歐洲國家得以參加。關於擴大五國條約最大的困難，當爲中立國家若瑞典瑞士之不願參加任何附帶軍事義務的條約，故料在比京所擬之五國條約其中關係安全保證之條文，當以最一般性的措辭予以規定，俾其他國家較易參加。至於英法荷比盧五國，如欲在軍事方面有更特定的約束，自毋妨於五國條約施行後，繼續就互防一點從事聯絡。</p>

<p>〔聯今社巴黎六日電〕法國國民議會今日數度表決許曼總理之反通貨膨脹法案，許曼之多數黨支援已减弱。國會觀察家不信內閣危機迫切，但認爲政治氣候惡劣，意外事件或將發生。今日共產然提出修正案，被以三〇四票對二九〇票否決，許曼僅獲十四票之差數。共黨提出完全推動新經濟法案之動議，被三〇一票對二八八票否決。</p>
<h3>蘇聯對東歐政策　以掠奪為主破壞歐洲復興　美眾院援外委會發表報告</h3>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓六日電〕據衆議院援外委員會報吿，蘇聯正一意　其　庸國家建設各種車　業，俾可迅速改裝以產生軍用品。報吿書中並列舉以下各點：（一）美國貸款芬蘭，以購置設備生產木材，實際無異助芬蘭對蘇聯支付賠款，芬蘭可因此輸出木材以償付蘇聯。（二）蘇聯對芬蘭匈牙利及羅馬尼亞之政策，以掠奪爲主。（三）蘇聯企圖在保加利亞捷克彼蘭及南斯拉夫發展蘇維埃式政治。（四）蘇聯政策在將來或更偏重政治而不着重經濟。國蘇聯在東歐盡量打擊反對黨，使其對蘇維埃化政策不能作有效抵抗，甚至在捷芬等無反對派之國亦加緊控制。（六）蘇聯因附庸國政府之「友好」性質，其　出之貨可索高價，而購進之貨則以低價付給·委員會發表此項報吿書，意在證明蘇聯附庸國家內之情形，如何可影響西歐之復興計劃。小國負担對蘇大量貿易之義務，但其總輸出額仍遠在戰前水準之下，即使各國能恢復其　前輸出量，運往西歐之貨物亦必　較以前爲少。東歐恐妨害其經濟，朱必願完全退守，且因對美關係緊張，蘇聯或將轉向西歐購買機器。</p>

<h3>英工程師預言　未來星球戰爭　各國將爭取月球基地　對地球發射火箭炸彈</h3>
<p>〔聯合社敦六日電〕英國星球研究會會刋頃發表會員克電佛論文，想像未來星球戰爭將較原子彈更爲恐怖。據稱將來各國將爭取月球基地，此種基地倘能製造燃料輿其他產物，即可成爲向地球發射火箭炸彈之最好基地。因月球之地心引力較地球爲小，故放射較地球便利。換言之，任何人首先月球設立工作基地，將較任何地球上之敵人無窮放射更大更優炸彈。最後人類可能携火箭赴其他星球，對付敵人·從道義上言之，人類隔流射箭與隔星球放火箭相殘殺，並無分別，人類應設法防止此種星球戰爭之實現。其一「超然國」或由美，英，蘇等國家大集團聯合組成之星球探測計劃，殆可於五十年內實現，除非人類愚昧不堪，而至無期延擱。此種組織可能逐步進行下列計劃：（一）建造高空火箭探測機，較目前之昇高紀錄加倍數三倍，戰運　員；（二）建造人類駕駛之飛艇，環飛月球，往來不着陸地；（三）建造飛艇載人類至月球，降落並飛回；（四）建造長程星球航行之飛艇，可用月球爲加油站，飛往更遠之星球。在星球探測計劃實　前，殆須運用原子能於火箭推進機。按克雷佛現任特海維蘭機械廠工程師，曾任特海維闌飛機廠技師，並爲英國航空協會會員。</p>
<h3>三黨首腦今日會議後　日新閣即可產生　民主黨正分配閣僚席數</h3>
<p>〔合衆社東京七日電〕日本新首相蘆田均決意將組閣之最後計劃延緩至八日下午，届時渠將與兩友黨首腦二度集議，然僉信新內閣將於九日就職。蘆田七日訪卸任首相吉田茂，面攬入閣，然吉田拒絕所請。其後三黨首腦會商時，蘆田又重請片山出任閣僚，亦遭片山之拒。若干觀察家稱：蘆田急於延邀片山入閣，蓋片山在外頗獲信用，而一旦社會民主黨之左翼份子，反對新政府時，亦僅片山可望阻遏此一攻勢。蘆田稱：八日下牛三黨首腦會議時，將向片山重提舊事。傳蘆田希望片山出就外務相之職。普遍相信片山不致接受，若然，則蘆田將放棄片山而逕行組織內閣。蘆田之民主黨領袖整週討論閣席之分配，一旦蘆田決定不需片山仍舊進行時，即可立即完成。傳國民協同黨主席三木武夫要求國協黨取得農林省，新政府與上届片山內閣將無大不同，兩者均爲社民，民主，國協三黨聯合政權，所異者，新政府中至少須有左翼社會黨人，以酬左蠶於二月二十一日在衆院攤牌表決中之助力。觀察家一般推測，由於無力阻遏通貨膨脹及處理其他經濟問題，新政府恐將短命夭亡。</p>

<h3>倫敦會議公報全文　魯兩國際化準德參加管制　土地及安全問題留待下屆會議討論</h3>
<p>〔路透社倫敦六日電〕英美法荷比盧六國討論德國問題之會議結束後，正式宣布會中業已成立國際管制魯爾區政策的協議。此間僉認此乃西方國家處理德國問題最顯著的新進展，然其成敗，尙須俟西方國家之各次會議，包括比京之五國西歐聯盟會議，巴黎之歐洲十六國會議完成以後，始能顯示。倫敦會議所協議之政策，將向與會六國政府提出建議。官方公報僅曰，此項建議涉及魯爾國際管制政權之形式及範圍，並曰，德國亦得參加管制機構，其他細則一時尙無透露。</p>
<p>倫敦會議結束後發表之公報，並曰，與會諸國一致承認德國西部有與西歐樹立密切經濟關係之必要。復曰，德境法國區及英美合併區在處理馬歇爾方案下對歐援助之永久機構中，應獲適當的代表權。又曰，土地及安全問題，議決留待下次會議討論。公報雖未宣布法國區與英美區之合併，但曰「英美法三國代表業已同意各向本國政府建議，在儘可能的範圍內，就三區之對外貿易運輸及關稅等經濟政策，從事密切合作。」</p>

<p>三強間確保合作</p>
<p>「美法三國代表團所曾討論者，爲德國賠償問題中與三國佔領區內部政策有關之部份，以及西德對於歐洲復興計劃之關係·當經確認爲西歐國家及民主德國之政治及經濟福利計，西歐國家與民主德國間之經濟生活，應有密切之聯繫。復以德國全國之經濟統一及東德之參加歐洲復興方案，已經證明爲不可能，英美法三國業已同意在三國之間及西德三佔領區間，應就歐洲復與方案與西德有關之問題，保持密切合作。爲使西德對歐洲之復興得有充分貢戲起見，此等合作實至爲必要。英美法三國代表團並同意西德英美合併區及法國區應充分參加歐洲復興方案，並在該方案之任何永久性機構中，獲有適當的代表權。三國代表團將各向本國政府提出此項建議，並將向下屆歐洲經濟合作委員會會議提出此項建議。</p>
<p>利用魯爾區資源</p>
<p>「關於荷比盧參加對德政策之點，巳疲致原則上之協議。各代表團並巳曾考慮設立魯爾國際管制政權之點，德國在該管制機構中亦得參加。該一國際管制機構之目的，在保證魯爾之經濟資源，不復再被用作侵略，並使歐洲廣大部份包括德國在內，得以享受魯爾區煤斤鋼鐵，焦煤等物產之利益。關於該國際管制機構的形式及職權範圍的協議建議案，將由各與會國代表國向本國政府提出。</p>
<p>統一德政治經濟</p>
<p>「各與會代表團復曾就德國之現狀及西德英美區及法國區內政治及經濟機構可能的進化，舉行具體的討論。就若干複雜之點，巳獲致廣泛協議，尤其重要者乃爲各與會代表團業已同意確認一聯邦形式的政府，具有適當的中央職權，同時予各邦權利以適當的保護，乃爲在現狀下最能朮建德國統一的適宜辦法。</p>
<p>「英美法三國代表團爲便利西德之與歐洲復興計劃合作起見，復已同意採取迅速行動，在儘可能範圍內，聯絡英美法三佔領區關於對外貿易，運　之及關稅等經濟政策」。</p>

<p>關於改善公務員待遜問題，昨據市府沈秘書長表示，際此物價高漲之際，市府業將務員困苦情形呈報中央，惟改善待遇，乃係全國性者，中央未便對上海一地特予提高，自本年一月份起，中央雖予調整待遇，依照公務員指數八萬五千倍計算，但配給食米一項，竟减少五斗，比次調整平均僅增加一百餘萬元，今减少食米五斗，亦减少收入百餘萬元，是則所謂調整，毫無增益，反之物價卻步步上昇，公務員生活確難維持，故市府刻已要求中央恢復食米配量仍爲八斗。此外市府並擬舉辦種種員工福利設施，如員工患病發給醫藥費等。</p>
<p>市庫並不充裕　難先撥款貼補</p>
<p>記者復詢以在由央　對公務員待遇作合理調整之前，市府可否先予貼補，沈氏表示，市庫經濟並不充裕，收支仍難平衡，無法另撥款補貼，况預算中並未列入，審計處亦碍難核准領款云。</p>

<h3>隨房荒應運而生　二房東時代寵兒　一間過街樓索價八千萬　房產掮客猶如雨後春筍</h3>
<p>〔本報特寫〕今日上海房荒情形的嚴重，實在已達到了登峯造極的程度。義賣房屋獎劵揭曉後，在絕對多數市民心目中所表現出來的歆羨，歡躍和失望，較之十年前期待航空獎劵巨額獎金的心情尤爲深刻。都市人口的過份集中，使本來寬敞整潔的弄堂變成了小吃店，使本來淸靜絕塵的路邊平添了許多聊避風雨的草棚；天井改爲前樓，前樓之上加閣，廂房一分爲三，灶間變成房間；舉炊則烟霧瀰漫，終日不散，兒啼則聲聞數戶，息息相通。在這連空氣和日光都成爲　寳　環境裏，竊盜，疫癘，戀奸，火警的連續發生，當然決非人力所可能防止的了。</p>
<p>言出如山　決不遷就</p>
<p>因爲隙地如金，擁有房地產的人便儼然成爲超臨此時此地的時代寵兒，雖然他們對租賃頂讓的威權已大半旁落於二房東之手，但身價則正隨物價的高漲而與日供增。至於二房東這一個名稱，現在是睥睨着一切職業，別的職業還可漫天討價，着地還錢，惟有一房東則言出如山，決不遷就。你如果早晨看屋，二房東開價大條兩根，你就須先付定洋二成，假使遲疑不決，晚間再去棗看，不是此屋業已頂出，就是再行加價一成。曾有一位公務員在最近去看一處祗有過街樓一間的房屋，二房東索價八千萬，這位公務員回說待再與太太商量後決定，當晚重趨該處，二房東正省戰方酣，公務員尙未及開口，二房東即雙手齊搖，迎說「不租了！」公務員當又聲稱願遵定價，二房東把臉往下一沉說：「出八千萬我也不租！」接着就敎訓起來：「辦事這樣嚕　，討厭！」</p>
<p>一間廂房　分隔為三</p>
<p>二房東的聲勢煊赫，使一般居有餘屋的人迅速地受到了感染。舊曆年中有狠多中上家庭往還幷年，見面恭喜之餘，就說：「今年你們要做二房東了」！恭維別人爲二房東已成阿諛之詞，二房東怎會不風起雲酒？餘屋多的不必說了，連祗有統廂房一間的人家，也雇工分隔爲三，名之　前廂，中廂，後廂，自己居前，中後　租，每廂如無良好設備，以時價一億一廂計算，兩億之款瞬可立致；二房客一躍而爲二房東，固然坐獲厚利，但可憐的，是費盡氣力僅復容身的小房客，事前張羅籌措，負債累累，事後仄居斗室，把生命在陰暗，潮濕，煩囂中漸漸磨滅，揉碎。</p>
<p>從鬧恐慌　儘有成交</p>
<p>有人說上海房荒嚴重，實在似是實非，因爲除了愛儷園，跑馬廳，外國墳山之類可望而不可及以外，那些重門深鎖，　無人跡的「瓊樓玉宇」仍然是數不勝數。也有人以爲普通　條路上，不出十步，必至少有空屋一間，怎見得呢？他們說報紙上日新又新的出租分類廣告，全市近千處房產掮客交易的每“記錄，都可作爲最翔寳的證明。</p>
<p>折衝樽俎　依人論價</p>
<p>談到房產掮客，這又是近年來崛起的獲利最　的職業之一。剛勝利時這批人活動的範圍不過僅限於「春風得意樓」，因爲顧忌禁令，從業人數，究屬有限，但時至今日，跟隨着遊資或携帶着被迫害後的命運，從蘇北，華北，以及川，滇，華南來滬的人紛然　集，求屋之切，或且有甚於求職，但異鄕陌路，房屋供求關係未必順利，他們於是在這中間欣然出現了；折衝撙俎，依人論價，雖然言明祗抽佣一成，但交易踵門而來，三日一大筆，兩日一小筆，累月經營，基礎便吿確立。</p>
<h3>活的標識　替代招貼</h3>
<p>因爲生意興隆，「春風得意樓」時代的掮客大都已開設專營字號，儼如此中祭酒了。利之所在，孰甘落後—房產掮客在最近半年來似雨後春筍，羣起招徠；有的是由醫生糧商改業，有的則爲舊貨商煙紙店兼營，他們除了設有機構指揮聯絡外，經當並派有遊動人員在外招攬接洽，便帽一頂，短裝打扮，宛如戲院門前兜售黑票的「黃牛」。這活的標識，已代替了幾年前滿佈街頭弄口的紅色召租招貼。</p>

<h3>昆市發現慘絕人寰血案　妻殺夫子弒父兄戕妺　兇犯曹新成在逃　從兩具女孩屍體　探獲奪產大悲劇</h3>
<p>〔中央社昆明七日電〕昆市東郊，於二月廿七日發現被人砍殺女孩屍體兩具，服式似小學生，並似姊妹，屍旁遺鈍斧一柄及筆墨等雜物，另在屍身上檢出「文忠」二字，證章一枚，當時會哄動全市，但無人認領，現經市警局旬日之偵查破獲，竟係一慘絕人寰之「妻殺夫，子弒父，兄殺妹」家庭大血案。兩女孩之父及庶母亦巳被害。警局破案之綫索，係依據「文忠」二字證章，查悉保山縣有文忠小學，乃派員往查，確係該校校章，並由城內住戶王正農之女領得，王係保山人，家資頗豐，有一妻一妾，妻李氏，四十餘歲，生一子，名錫榮，不務正業，妾姬氏，生二女，名錫祿，錫侯，即在昆郊被殺者。當警探抵王家時，發覺王正農已失蹤，僅王妻李氏在家，言語支吾，經拘訊後，方供出平日家庭中，妻妾不睦，李氏與子錫榮謀奪家產，夥同王之妹夫曹新成，曾任軍政部軍械保養訓練班材料科長，先將王正農及姬氏於上月中旬，用斧砍死，屍體埋藏在曹之花園內。曹於二月二十日携二女來昆殺死，以遂平分家產之陰謀，曹在逃，曹妻王氏亦已拘獲。</p>
<h3>山西紀行（三）　渡災減食</h3>
<p>十二年前，山西就唱出了閻錫山手寫的「防共歌」：「共黨騙人一共分三期，先甜後辣勿受欺，第一買好期，給你小便宜，分糧分地買你心歡喜·傷心掉淚第二强制期，你的身家不由你，男當赤衛軍，女當慰勞隊，父母妻子永久兩分離。驚心動魄第三殺戮期，稍不如意殺無疑，不是塡砲眼，就是刀砍你，江西陝北殺人如螞蟻。「共匪拿上了當人的錢，地主的地，窮人的命，作爲今日搶奪政權的資本，展開了殘忍無比的全面叛亂，造成飢餓！　在去年五月間全國各地物價普遍飛漲的時候，太原就針對現實，提出了一個並無深奧的經濟原理的的辦法—「平民經濟」。以簡化生活，保護生活，分配工作，配購產物爲實施中心來過渡共匪仇人敵物的難關。</p>
<p>簡化生活</p>
<p>簡化生活在求「均」與「安」，除掉軍人可以吃小米，小麥各半的頭等飯外，其餘不分官民貧富。一律吃二等飯——小麥兩日份，細糧（包括小米豆麵蕎麥等）八日份，雜糧（包括玉菱，高染，大麥等）二十日份。食鹽每片半斤小口减半，每人每年不得超過價値原法幣四元的花布。所謂原法幣也是一個新名詞，但並不是貨幣，不過是以抗戰而夕一疋三號布的價格爲基價與現在一疋三號布的價格作比較求指數，以這個指數作爲與農產壘交換的尺度的一種觀念上的折算標準。飯店也　了等級，「宴賓」的三家，專招待外賓，准賣高級飯菜。「社交」七家，爲婚喪用，其餘全係平民食堂。</p>
<p>保護生活</p>
<p>執行平經政策的機關是「平民經濟執行委員會」，在「保護生活」上，規定農工商的收人一律平等。同時登記失業者，負責分配工作，至於「配購產物」，範圍就顯得很廣。執行省內工業產品和農業產品的交換以及本省產品換取外省的原料和生活必需品，可是就前者說，普中的三自運動嚴格劃淸了國家與國家的敵人，迎物資也劃淸了，吸收匪區食糧已談不到，至於政府控制地區，又已到了山窮水盡之境。就後有說，陳納德的空運　隊是這裏唯一交通工其，但每噸法幣一億數千萬元的運費，實在不堪負担。</p>
<p>太原市的商店一個個在呌苦，在統一採購的嚴格管制下，已不能打起他們的如意算盤，許多店裏雖還堆着無數的洋酒罐頭，可是誰多吃不消那種高價。自由市塲雖有，也僅限於食糧和日用必需品。</p>
<p>市內春聯</p>
<p>平執會是由農，工，商，自衛隊，婦女等各界選出委員十八人來辦理平經事宜的，但下面還有閭民座談會，每週一次，座談會裏能够通過的事項，才能付諸實施，這個辦辦法是使民主精神到了高度發揮的境界。但我在晋祠時，看到牆壁上有這樣一首打油詩：「天平地不平，水平山不平，人平心不平，十人九不平。」太原市內聽說也有這副春聯：「人家過年二上八下（形容做水餃的手勢），咱們迎春九外一中（做窩窩頭工勢）」，橫楣是「平民經濟」。這年頭，只怕再沒有比「平一這個　的不易做到了。</p>
<p>山西當局　認過去八個月來「平民經濟」大體上很收效果，但是現在關將軍嘆氣了：「今天山西的糧食已不是貴賤的問題，是有無的問題，現在已由平民經濟的調配階段走上救荒的階段了。」</p>
<p>救荒問題</p>
<p>成晋中嚴重糧荒的原因是去年的春夏亢旱，收成不足中稔年的十分之三，四，另一方面是匪共「算老賬」以後的難民和「驅蝗蟲」手段　入山西的老弱婦孺，平空替晋中孤島增添了六十多萬人的負担，　計本年春季晋中各縣至少有一半以上的人缺糧三個月。爲了渡災减食，問將軍發表了沉痛的「吿晋中人民書」：「只有我們自己减食與希望中央賑濟，飛機遝糧之兩途。但求政府飛機輸送，也是個困難的事，不能希望太奢，今天我們着重於人民節食。」「我暫擬至少以四個人的飯，勻成五個人喫，也就是一個人四天的飯勻成五天喫。」「今天勻食易，他日斷炊難。」</p>
<p>貸款購糧</p>
<p>太原的物價高到如此：七百萬元一担的小麥，四萬元一斤的高梁，三百五十萬元一袋麵粉。　光緖三年，老百姓餓死在一堆堆銀　寳旁邊的慘景，會在山西重現嗎？要不然，紀者也不會聽到這種呼籲：「請中央准以太原等城市人民一切財產，房院，工廠等作抵押，向國內外貸借款項，購糧飛運調劑，以救饑荒！」（本報記者楊文育）</p>

<h3>粵省綏靖　展開掃蕩</h3>
<p>〔本報廣州四日航訊，〕南　省資源　富，目前　比較安定，誠然是開發經濟資源的理想地點。自宋于文氏主粵後，大家對華南經濟建設，便投以樂觀的目光，尤其　僑與外商，更視廣東為他們投資的樂土；我們展望粵省的經建前途，無疑地是光明燦爛；但我們却不能忽略的，就是地方的綏靖問題，因爲地方不靖，是當前建設的最大障礙；所以宋子文蒞粵後，對經建計劃，固有成竹在胸，但照實際情形觀察，却使他不能不認爲「治安第一」；要建設新廣東，肅淸匪患則是先決的問題。</p>
<p>三萬之眾　土匪佔半</p>
<p>根據廣州行轅最近的統計：全省的匪軍約有三萬餘人，其分佈在東江地區約五千餘人，韓江一帶共一千六百餘人，粵南地區八千餘人，珠江地區約六百餘人，西江地區二千三百餘人，北江地區四千八百餘人，瓊崖方面六千五百餘人。他們以所謂「人民解放軍」「民主聯軍」等名義，在粵境各地騷擾；察其行動及企圖，是破壞我政治基層組織，擾亂我後方，牽制國軍力量；最近共匪聲言五月渡江，促成華南合流，處張聲勢。從這看來，共匪對華南破壞的陰謀，確實不小；而且就算行轅統計的三萬餘人，也實在不能算是一個小的數字。說來豈不是很可怕？事實却又不然。因爲這所謂三萬之衆，其屬眞正共匪，恐怕有限；而地方上的歹徒流氓之類的土匪，實佔其大半；這部份土匪多數由於農村破產，生活困難，迫得挺而走險，集羣結黨，打家刧舍；不過共匪則煽動勾結他們，彼此互相利用，借他們的力量到處騷擾，做成聲勢浩蕩；而土匪也借着共匪的旗幟，以抬高聲威，而遂其刧財掠貨的目的吧了。所以像這樣的烏合之衆，其爲害地方，破壞政府建設則有餘；如果說他們會有規模的政治性叛亂，却是屬於過慮的。</p>
<p>重新部署　全面清剿</p>
<p>粵省當局的剿匪計劃，自從去冬兩廣綏靖會議在穗舉行之後，便開始重新部署，決定實行全面淸剿；將全省劃　爲八個淸剿區，然後分區綏靖。這八個區的指揮官，是經過宋主席很慎重地去物色，結果決定了由何彤，葉肇，陳文　張光瓊，喻英奇，竹舉直，劉其寬，張瑞貴等八位將軍，來分別擔任由第一區至第八區的專員兼指揮官。後並成立了粵湘贛，和粵閩兩個邊區淸剿總部，前有由葉肇任總指揮，而以莫雄升補葉氏原來第二區指揮官之缺；後者則由凃思宗任總指揮，陳銓副之。這八個區和個邊區的指揮官，全是舉國知各的戰將，抗戰期間也曾有過不少彪炳的戰蹟；而且他們對各該區的情形，都是很熟悉的，這次被宋主席邀請來負這綏靖地方的重責，可</p>

<p>一週經濟般物價　食糧類漲勢較為平穩　化學品紡織品等次之　　　上週是三月第一週，在這以前的兩週，也即是陰曆年關以後的最初兩週，物價巳經經過一度劇烈波動。這一度波動形勢異常猛烈，是本年度第一次物價週期大波動。在這次波動中，食糧·紡織品·化學品·上升最速，按照本會編製的按貨物用途分類批發物價指數，食糧類兩內週上升百分之七十一，同期化學品上升百分之六十五，紡織品上升百分之五十三，燃料·建築材料·上升較少，物價總指數上升百分之四十二　　經過這兩週物價急劇上升後，到上週初銀根已現緊勢，似乎這一度物價波動將達一間歇時期。本來物價之乍漲乍平，銀根之時鬆時緊，交替更迭，是通貨膨脹後期無可避免的現象。舉一譬喻，社會如一蓄水器，通貨如器中之水，而器的體積大小象徵物價水準之高低，器中水位高低，則象徵銀根鬆緊。當器中之水流入多於流出，則水位逐漸升高，亦即銀根逐漸鬆弛。及至水滿容器，即銀根異常鬆弛，若仍舊流入多於流出，則舊容　勢必將容納這麽多的水量，於是容器必須更新，體積必須擴大，亦即物價水準必然提高，於是在新容器內因爲容量擴大，舊有水量雖尙未變更，水位已大爲降低，亦即銀根已轉緊俏。此後若流入仍超流出，則又將複演以上的過程，如是週而復始，循環不息。物價漲落交替，銀根鬆緊更迭。但祗要流入繼續多於流出，容器體積總是逐漸擴大不已。　　上週初因前二週物價上升甚猛，銀根緊俏，各項物價俱見回跌，如上白粳由前週末每石三百萬，上週一降爲二百八十萬，兵船麥粉同期由每袋百三十二萬降到百二十四萬。四十二支藍鳳每件由一億三千萬降爲一億零三百萬，箭刀牌肥皂每箱由三百七十七萬降爲三百六十萬。但銀根的緊勢不二日巳轉鬆弛，其原因留在下節貨幣金融項下再論，於是各項物價無不回升，這次回升就打破了週初物價波動將暫入隔歇時期的預期。而且回升之勢勢增無已，到週末雖然銀根再度轉俏，但是物價漲勢依然不止，食糧市場再度陷入瘋狂狀態，白粳升連三百四十萬，四十二支藍鳳出一偉三千萬，般可驚的是廠絲，B級八三分勻度白廠絲，自週一一億六千四百萬到週末已升達二億關口，各物價格無不呈現新高峯·僅化學品較爲平穩。下週希望銀根迅速抽緊，否則週末漲勢大有蔓延可能，賢明的金融當局，諒早已有鑒及此而預爲之計。上週批發物價指數按用途分類者如次　　類名　上週指數　較前週漲跌百分比　　食物類　二七五，八七〇　漲六·五　紡織品類　三五一，六三〇　漲十一·〇　　燃料類　三四二，八五〇　漲十三·三　　金屬類　三〇五，一九〇　漲三〇·八　　建築材料類　三三三，一六〇　漲十四·七　　化學品類　五五三，一四八　漲三·九　　雜項類　三〇〇，七三〇　漲六·九　　總指數　三三〇，七五〇　漲十·九　　上週批發物價指數按加工程度分類者如次　　類名　上週指數　較前週漲跌百分比（原料品類）　　食物植物產品　二七五，八七〇　漲六·五　　非食物植物產品　二一八，三四〇　漲六·四　　動物產品　一六七，〇二五　漲〇·九　　礦產品　三三四，一四〇　漲二四·八　　本類總指數　二三九，九〇〇　漲六·三　　（製造品類）　　生產品　四五八，七八三　漲十一·六　　消費品　三七五，六二〇　漲九·二　　本類總指數　四一九，六一〇　漲十·八　　類名　上週指數　較前週漲跌百分比　　出口貨類　二〇二，〇四七　漲三·七　　進口貨類　三七一，三三〇　漲十五·八　　進出口貨總指數　二七三，九一〇　漲九·六　　國內產銷貨總指數　二九四，六九四　漲一·四貨幣金融　銀根鬆勢再起　游資南逃劇烈　　上週本市銀根，就週一而論，雖尙承前週週五以後因國家行局連日鉅進，與一般物價籌碍掛高所造成的勢的餘波，但這餘波不過短短三日，就成强弩之末。兩次銀根鬆勢之間的間歇時間之縮短，正與兩次物價漲間歇時間之縮短相配合——刻劃出了中國惡性通貨膨脹過程的後期階段。不但如此，變化的趨勢更指明銀根的「一鬆一緊」以及物價的「一漲一平」將逐漸爲銀根的「不斷鬆弛」與物價的「不停上漲」所替代。　　本刊前曾一再指出（前載新聞報），要以有限物資的拋售去抑一制有增無已的通貨膨脹，乃是不可能的事。上週週二週三，與一般的預期相反，銀根忽自俏轉穩，國家行局無鉅額差進固然起了一部份影響，而外埠游資如潮水一般的湧來，亦爲不能輕視的主因。例如週三一天，國家行局的實際產進不過八百卅一億，數量之少，爲半月來所未見·週四更　一反前態，扣除商業銀行於國行的定存後，國家行局竟差出一千多億。週五亦有一百七十餘億之實差出，於是加上各地流入的游資，本市銀根又從平穩轉爲鬆弛了。雖然週末國家行局有有三千餘億之差進，銀根又稍視緊俏。　　至於商業行莊方面上週除週一週末以外，頭寸均感寬裕，單子不缺，同業拆放亦未見盛做，現鈔籌碼週初週末雖一度帶緊，但其餘幾天普見鬆弛。不過行莊解繳國行的現鈔上週相形减少，下半週更降至每天百億左右。間接交換組之　數以週一之一七五〇億與週末之三千八百〇四億爲最高，週五之九十七億爲最低。洋商銀行的差進除週末之四百餘億外，經常在每天六百億至九百餘億之十間，在銀根鬆弛，同業拆放寥落之際，而能維持如此鉅額之差進，足徵游資南逃的愈見劇烈。　　上週暗息，以二角二分半爲中心，亦爲高做至二角四五分者，但週五落至二角一分，當與銀根之鬆弛有關。週末升至二角五分，頭寸稍見吃香。證劵帮塲外貼息多方貼出。最低爲週一週二的二角八分半，最高爲週四之三角三分。空方貼進以週四之八分半爲高盤，週一週二爲二角四分，週三週五則爲二角七分　　內外匯率　　　上週內匯匯率，穗匯與漢匯匯水自週一週三均見减少，週四穩定。但週五週末本市匯往廣州漢口，重慶等地的匯水竟一致劇烈增加，據說這與資金的南逃有密切關係。因爲本市南匯資金除直接匯往華南各大都市外，還多先匯往漢渝等地，再由各該地設法南匯，可見本市匯往華中區域匯水上升，朱必是資金北返的預示。至於上週本市津匯貼水，大致穩定在每千元二十元的水準。　至於上週外匯行市，平衡基金率美匯英匯均未掛高，但香港由匯竟續有報縮，週一香港華幣十萬元可換港幣一元八角。此後迭縮，至週五竟跌至一元五角二分，週末續落至一元五角。這是資金南流，對美鈔港幣需求擴大的後果。香港美鈔市價亦相應上漲，週一美鈔一元可換港幣五元三角三，但週末需港幣五元六角二分才可換到美鈔一元了，　　華洋股市　　　本市上週股市，如與華股相數，則外股漲勢遠較華股爲烈。如以上週週一開價作基數而與週末之收價比，華股之增漲率大抵在一成左右，其間如永紗漲一成半，美亞漲百分之九，景福新光各上漲百分之十一。但外股一週內漲率之巨頗屬空前，如怡紗漲三成半，英聯漲三成，會德豐約漲五成。怡啤週一之買價爲廿七萬二千，而週末午後價升至四十四萬，增漲率達百分之六十。各股之長期走勢雖一致報漲，但一日之間，漲跌頗有參差，單就華股永紗而論，週一週三週五前市收價皆一度小於開盤，後市再見盤升，週二則節節上升，週四週末後市收盤反較前市下挫，此種參差，主要係受多空鬥法之影響。上週外股之所以好於華股，當以港匯之迭見報縮爲主因，至於華洋各股長期走勢之一致升挺，當然游資泛濫的貨幣因素應該負最大的責任了。工商動態　　（一）工業在癱瘓　　　隨着四聯當局對十五萬億農貸方案的審查完竣，工貸計劃，上週在報端似乎亦屢見披露了。無可置疑，工貸的開放，確可使一部份週轉不靈的中小工業鬆一口氣，但目前中國工業之所以凋敝，確另有其更深遠的原因在。例如水泥工業因其處境日見危殆曾呼籲當局立即開放工貸，據說該業在國內戰局日益擴大的今天，深感運輸困難，成本激增以及銷路不振之苦。茲據該業負責人表示一年來電力費用已增加六十一倍，柴油增五十四倍，但水泥售價較諸去年一月份每包二萬九千元之數，僅增十倍，銷路方面則各廠每月銷售量平均尙不及產量之三成。此種境况自然難維持，但如僅欲以工貸的開放作爲損失的挹注，恐怕祗解決了問題的一部份而已。　　其次說到鋼鐵生產，自從國軍撤守鞍出後，上海鋼鐵公司即轉交了鴻運，據說該公司的訂貨已到達今年五月中·按理自當擴大生產以應需要。但據該公司總工程師稱，目前原料燃料兩覺不够，燃料方面，該公司三廠月需柴油三百五十噸，但每月只能獲得配油一百九十噸；每月需煤八百噸，但只購得配煤三百噸，去冬更少至一百五十噸。至於原料方面更覺缺乏。所存廢鐵，即將用罄。現在台灣雖尙能供應一部份，但新的來源，迄無把握，增加產量一節，自更難辦到了。　　（二）貿易在衰落　　對於輸入限額增加或重分配的一要求，幾乎每週都有若千起。上週製藥業等三公會，亦曾起而要求增加限額。他們認爲最初若千季中他們所得的限額不過六十萬美元，祗佔總輸入限額的百分之一左右，已經有失公允。到五六兩季，竟再以此數削减，不但是製藥業即一般人民也會發生不足之感。但在外匯枯竭而且還要負擔龐大戰費的今天，要增加限額，眞是困難重重，於是當局擬議了一個輸出成品可准優先輸入原料的辦法。據悉倘廠商請求輸入原料之總値，朱超過其輸出成品價値百分之四十者，即可　先獲得批准，但附帶條件為此項廠商在結購進口外匯時即須將輸出品總値全數結售指定銀行。可知政府最終還是在打算如何掌握此百分之六十之外匯剩餘額，而且，在結購進口外匯時，即以輸出品全數售結，在物價繼漲的今日吃虧者恐仍在廠商這一面吧！　　至於最近出口業務，據業中人說因受國內物價上漲影響，工本激增，多數出口貨與國外市價相較，起差幾達一倍，又因英日等國爲鼓勵輸出，所有物資概由政府收購，削碼出售，爭取國外市塲，致我國出口貨更無法與之競爭，例如生絲一項，即因日絲壟斷市場，外銷已頻絕境，則出口業之日趨衰落，是所難免。　　華國商務部在其所發表的「外貿易政策最近　勢」的一文中說得最透切：「中國政府於一九四七年繼續整頓國外貿易，希望將其置於一堅固而平衡之基礎上之努力，已因內戰之持續，一般國內經濟環境之混亂及通貨之更見貶値而被否定其效果。……一九四七年中國輸出之價値僅及其輸入之一小部份，因貿易法令之經常改變，申請手續之困難及匯率重新調整之頻繁而增加共國外貿易之不安定性及投機性。」目前據報載，爲促進進出口貿易，現行政策又將修正。據說在新政策下，政府可於一年內掌握一億八千萬美元的外匯，我們祝它早日成功。　　中信發表人絲配價　　〔本報訊〕中信局發表三月八日至十三日人造絲脾價，計東洋一A一一六四〇萬元，二A一一四工〇萬元，三A一一〇六〇萬元，四A一〇四八〇萬元。天橋一A一一五六〇萬元，二A一一三三〇萬元，三A一〇九九〇萬元，四A工〇四一〇萬元。其他一A一一五二〇萬元，二A一一二九〇萬元，三A一〇九五〇萬元，四A一〇三七〇萬元。內匯率調整　　〔本報訊〕四行二局一庫內匯率，自三月八日起，調整如次：連雲港每千元收二五元，（原二〇元）。徐州二玉元，（原二〇元）。漢口武昌一〇〇元，（原七〇元）。沙市宜昌及湖北區其他各地一二〇元，（原九〇元）。南昌五〇元，（原三〇元）。景德鎭九江吉安贛州及江西區其他各地六〇元，（原四〇元（。重慶成都五〇元，（原二五元）。叙府萬縣及四川區其他各地七〇元，（原五〇元）。河南區一〇〇元，（原七〇元）。貴州八〇元，（原六〇元）。雲南五〇元，（原三〇元）。上海批發物價指數表　　按貨物用途分類（簡單幾何平均民國二十五年等於一）工商調查國營「中紡」之資產及其生產量　　　國營中國紡織建設公司，爲現今紡織業之巨擘。在上海者，擁有機械廠二所，工廠設備二十六年基價法幣五一四，九七二元，地產照三十六年三月時價値二，四七九，五六〇，〇〇〇元。印染染廠六所，工廠設備二十六年基價七，七三一，五七四元，地產三十六年時價一五，八二三，〇五〇，〇〇〇元。毛紡織廠五所，製麻廠二所，絹紡，針織各一廠，設備總値二十六年法幣一二，四六三，八九三元，地產三十六年三月法幣二三，五五九，三七八，〇〇〇元，紡織廠十七所，工廠設備二十六年法幣七二，〇九〇，三六八元。地產三十六年三月法幣一六一，六五九，六〇〇，〇〇〇元。綜計上海方面各廠設備，共値二十六年法幣九二，八〇〇，八〇七元，地產共値三十六年三月法幣二〇四，五二一，五八八，〇〇〇元。　　在天津者則有紡織廠七所，其資產估値亦已統計完竣，據悉全部機器設備，原動力，房屋等共値二十六年法幣三五，五八九，八四五元。地產則照三十六年三月時價估計，共値法幣二三，三九五，九一〇，〇〇〇元。　此外尙有在靑島者紡

<p>科學蘇聯的科學研究計劃  楊實　　　本刊先後把美國和英國戰後偉大的科學研究計劃，都介紹給我們了。對於蘇聯，這個新興的强大國家，在科學上的努力和成就究竟如何，也是我們亟於想知道的。不過因爲材料的不足和文字的隔膜，我們對她的新計劃是知道的非常不詳細。從前她也是個科學落後的國家，現在在科學上的奮進和成就，多少對我們中國有許多鼓勵和借鏡的地方。因此，在這裏我們想把他們最近的活動，廣泛地介紹一下。　　美國原子核物理權威蓋穆（Irving　langmuir）在參加了蘇聯科學院創立二百週年紀念，回國後曾公開講演道：「蘇聯人似乎是爲了科學本身而愛好科學。」眞的，蘇聯爲了要把她的制度證明給全世界，「這是最科學而且最合理的」，她在科學上的努力是驚人的，她那偉大的科學研究計劃，是英美無法比擬的。史達林曾吿訴過蘇聯科學家們：「我們不但要追上去，而且要超越過他們的成就。」　　龐大的經費　　　　在這偉大的計劃中，是需要耗費不少金錢的，在一九四七年爲訓練科學幹部，耗費在大學敎育上的，就是六十億盧布，而其他研究經費更是直綫的增加，去年用度是一九四〇年的三倍，這比美國的十年計劃的用度還多。由於她的特殊經濟制度，科學家和工程師是享受最優異的待遇；在美國，一個科學家除非有了超越的成就，是不會受到私人研究機構的聘任的。在蘇聯，從大學畢業後，科學工作者都有較優的研究的機會和地方。　　研究的機構　　　　遠在一七二六年，彼得大帝爲了「吸收西方文明」成立了科學院，二百年來這個機構始終是俄國科學研究的中心，內部繼續在擴大各種研究所和分佈在各地的分院——民族科學院，牠除了解決高深的問題外，還要聯繫全國科學家的研究工作，並且分別指導着。蘇聯的每次五年計劃，都需要科學院的討論後才實行。現在牠有四百三十多位院士按着新研究計劃進行。直接屬於她而分怖在全國的一共就有一千多個科學研究所。　　除了這個研究中心，還有醫藥科學院，敎育科學院，建築科學院，藝術科學院，農業科學院以及新成立的砲術科學院。其中就農業科學院一院而言，其組織之龐大令人咋舌，一千二百多個科學家分別在一百多個各種研究所工作，在每一個集體農塲區都有他們的種子檢查站和種子分配站。　　人才的缺乏　　　　和英美遭到同樣困難，蘇聯也極感人才的缺乏，多少急欲進行的研究因無人停頓下來。在她的新五年計劃中對人才的訓練有很具體的程序。目前從事各部門研究所的工作者僅只有十萬多個科學家，這其中只有一萬二千多個科學博士和敎授，二萬五千多個科學碩士和副敎授。戰後，每個大學的大學生人數巳經加倍在七九二個高等學校中一九四七年有六十五萬個大學在受科學訓練，預計到一九四八年就可增到七十萬，而到一九五〇年完成計劃時，就得容納八十萬大學生在受教育。而專科學校學生到一九四七年底只　容　一百萬學生，完成時要增加百分之四十。　　智識的交換　　　　英美在戰後方才開始在派駐各國使館中設置科學情報組，專司傳這交換科學的研究報吿及駐在國的科學家一切活動。共實蘇聯早就這樣做了。她的科學院和各種研究所都聘請國外著名科學家爲名譽院士或特約通訊員。在翻評國外科學書報上，蘇聯的迅速及出版量也很驚人。在國內，他們已成立了傳播科學知識協會，分會遍及全國，以灌輸科學知織給一般人民和靑生學生，負責這僻協會的有八百二十個科學博士之多。在國外，他們已籌備今年四月十五日在莫斯科召開斯拉夫科學家代表大會，除了連絡各斯拉夫國家的科學家外，還廣泛的交撚研究心得。　　原子能及宇宙綫　　　　由於蘇聯和美國的國交惡化，人們很容勿想到蘇聯在原子能方面的計劃如何，這要失望的，和美國一樣，他們關於這方面的計劃如何是秘而不宣的，但有計劃是毫無疑義了。遠在一九三四年，原子衝擊器（Cyclotron）就蝓入了蘇聯。一九三七年他們自己能造成范迪可夫式靜電發電機（Van　de　Graaff’selectrostatic　genevator），而他們已造成的原子衝擊器也在一九四六年十二月開始應用。在開彼茲（Kapitza利霞夫（Joffe）二人及俘虜的許多德國原子核物理學家努力之下，他們的成就是不容忽視的。　　在宇宙綫上蘇聯科學家的成就最大，因之，他們在這方面的計劃一定也很大。我們都知道宇　綫是含着巨大的能量的，牠能引起突變，進化和退化，這危險的射綫會在生物體肉誘生可怕的癌。從宇宙綫內製造超級原子彈在理論上是成立的。所以，莫洛托夫在講演中暗示蘇聯已有原子彈，被人相信也許從宇宙綫中製造出來，不是沒有理由的。在戰後的五年計劃中，蘇聯不但把她的工業慢慢向東方移動，同時把科學研究計劃帶到荒凉的北極去。在那許多港口中他們用電燈克服了漫長的黑夜，進行着幾項重大的研究工作。由國際知名的育種學者雷森科敎授的指導，他們宣騐一種適於北極生長的耐寒植物，初步的成功已經獲得。北極研究所更有輝煌的成就，他們經年的考察後，巳在所謂「不能到的極地」中證實了第二地磁極的存在。同時，他們也發現了不少溫泉，有些溫泉中是含有放射性一元素的礦物質，這些都是原子彈的主要原料，他們已計劃大量的提煉它。　　今年一月八日，蘇聯科學院院長宜佈一九四八年各分院及研究基地之科學研究計劃，包括二十個主要課題。數理方面側重發光性，無色與有色金屬冶金學的研究，天文學方面改造並擴大世界最大天文台之一的普爾科佛的中央天文台。人文科學方面，將由語言學家研究蘇聯境內之許多民族語言文字。又關於中亞，外高加孛，遠束，北極等處之天產資源與經濟狀况以爲科學院工作計劃之一部分。總計一九四八年之工作包括各稱基本問題三百五十種之多。　　蘇聯現在在科學上足以領導世界的是她的醫學，地質學，遺傳學，土壤化學及流體力學。特別在醫學上，如巴甫洛夫在生理學和心理學的新學說——交替反射，替近世病症學創立了一條大道。他如血淸的發明，美奇尼可夫的細菌學說，賴生戈的靑春化（Vernalization）都是了不起的成就。　　其他有關國防的科學，他們的成就是秘而不宣的，但從藍穆的回憶錄中，顯見這位美國大科學家對蘇聯科學發展是不敢輕視的，他說：　　「蘇聯有着堅强，粗野，急進，健康而充滿生命力的國民……我相信他們已擬好了戰後的偉大科學計劃，這計劃必大於任何國家所擬想者……他們正採用激發的方法，比我們從資本主義制度所留遺下的方法更爲有效。如果我們仍舊由於政府的政策及勞工的影響而去悶窒我們進步所賴的激發因素，那麼經過一個時後，蘇聯必然更迅速地走在我們的前面了。」　　孟德銳夫（Dmitri　Ivanovich　Mende　leeff，1934—1907）俄國著名化學家，爲化學元素週期律之創立人，依原子序數，將元素列成週期表，可以預測未曾發現之新元素的存在，發前人所未發，開後學之新徑，厥功至偉；蘇聯科學之得有今日，孟氏實植其基礎（咸）科學工業皮革鍍銅法  劉逐生　　—以童鞋為例—　　假如兒童皮鞋鍍上了銅，變成光輝燦爛的銅鞋，不僅爲父母者見而心喜，也是一種鍍銅工藝的發軔。茲將鈹法敍述於次：　　取巴黎石膏（又名熟石膏分子式爲（CaSO4）2·H2o）少許，和水調成糊狀，塗於鞋面後，再用洋漆塗抹·待乾，更用石墨粉滿涂鞋面，磨光備用。　　玻璃或磁筒中盛一加侖淸水，溶入二十七盎斯硫酸銅（CuSO4，再緩緩注入六盎斯又半的濃硫酸，即成鍍銅液。更取乾電池三隻，依圖串聯以後，將陰極電綫緊皮鞋，陽極電綫繫一銅板，兩均懸於鍍液中，悉如圖所示。時時轉動皮鞋的方向，約經十分至十五分鐘後，取出童鞋，洗淸鍍液。磨光以後，更塗以透明油漆即得。（皮革鍍銅圖）單雌生殖子裔的決別決定（續）  謝冶英　　（三）人工單雌生殖及其子裔的性別　　人工單雌生殖的實騐研究，由來已久，成績較著者，當首推俄國胚胎學者提可米羅夫（Tichomiroff）氏在1885—1886年，用蠶產下的未受精卵，以兩種不同的方法來試騐，一種是將此種浸入純硫酸中，經數分鐘後取出，另一種用毛刷在卵子上刷幾下，他觀察這些卵能發育成蠶胚。在當夜初已是一件人工單雌生殖的驚人成績。但他始終沒有看到出卵的小蠶。在提可米羅夫以後引起很多人作同類的問題之研究。或用物理刺激（如電，光，熟，搖動等）以引起單雜生殖，或用化學刺激（如氣，滲透壓力，鹽酸，碳酸，燐酸，純酒精，氣氯化鉀，氨，醋酸等）以引起單雌生殖。　　德國生物學家羅勃（Loeb）于1900年，以海胆作爲試騐的材料，他用兩種溶液，第一種是海水裏加入少量的酪酸（Butyricacid），第二種是海水裏加入食鹽，如將海胆未受精卵先放人第一種溶液，後來再移入第二種溶液，最後移入普通海水中；這些卵就像受了精一樣發生變化，經過分裂，甚至可發育成爲能自由游泳的幼體。　　除蠶和海胆外，還有多種棘皮運動，環節動物，軟體動物，都可行人工單雌生殖。甚至在脊推動物方面，也有人做過實騐（如角類與蛙類），不過很少能發育完整，往往出胎體前就夭折了　　至於講到牠們的子裔性別，十致與天然單雌生殖之情形相同，經减數分裂之未受精卵演發爲雌裔。　　就海胆論，海胆之未受精卵，行人工單雌生殖之結果，能發育成游泳自如之幼體者，頗爲難得。大多數是柔弱多病不易長成。其幸而能長成之個體，均屬雄性，並已經證明此種雄裔之染色體確係單組。此種有母無父的海胆，會不會產生完善的精子，還是疑問，若果能產出精子，可否與卵子配合受精，那就更無法證明了。（註四）　　德拉日（Y．Deloge）另用二氧化碳爲海星的單雌生殖的實驗，曾獲有一發育完全之海星，但不知其性屬。　　在蠶的人工單雌生殖之子裔中，如按正常情形，應該演發雄裔，而有時却亦可見雌裔（註五），實際上這些子裔傳種接代的能力很弱，不是當代無法產生完善的生殖細胞，就是第二代無法繼續　　至於脊椎動物如蛙類，可用針刺法，以引起卵子單獨發育，但很少能達到蝌蚪時期，大多未近變態而先死亡。日本川村氏（T．Kawamura）在1939年發表其對蛙類行人工單雌生殖的結果，其子裔雌雄兩種性別的都有，據說雌的很多，雄很少。大概是由雙組染色體演發而成的。或者係卵核本本經减數分裂（偶然有之），或者由第二極體內入，與卵核融合而成。　　在獸類中，行人工單雌生殖，雖能有發育之傾向，但是因爲難於配備胚胎時期所需之各種生理條件，目前尙無法培養到一個完整的幼體。法人張裴（Champy）氏，曾用兎子的卵卵培養于人工環境中，看到能分裂到八個細胞的時期，但以後則不復見其再往前演發，此種卵旣不能成全胎，故共子裔之性別也就無從談起。　　（結論）　　　　綜上所述，關於單雌生殖之子裔的性別決定，巳可窺其大概，茲更扼要作一結論如下：　　（一）單雌生殖，無論在動植物中均可見之。但嚴格言之，只有那未經受精的卵子而能演發爲後代的生物者，始得稱之。　　（二）單雌生殖本是少數生物的一種自然生殖法，但若干種類的生物，也可以利用各種人爲的理化刺激促使未受精的卵子單獨發育，前者稱天然單雌生殖，後者稱人工單雌生殖。　　（三）單雌生殖所產之子裔，有些種類成雄體，稱雄裔單雌生殖。有些種類成雌體，稱雌裔單雌生殖。還有些種類可以兼產雌雄兩種個體的，稱兩性裔單雌生殖　　（四）單雌生殖子裔的性別決定與細胞內染色體組數之單雙有關，如卵子經减數分裂，僅念單組染色體者，恒演發爲雄裔，—單組染色體的雄裔單雌生殖。如卵子不經减數分裂而仍含雙組染色體者，在若干種類恒演發成雌—雙組染色體之雌裔單雌生殖，在若干種類，旣能演發成雌，復可演發成雄（其細胞內之染色體常少一或二個）—雙組染色體之兩性裔單雌生殖。更有一類，在其生命史中有單組染色體之單雌生殖，亦有雙組染色體之單雌生殖，前者產生雄裔，後者產生雌裔。二種不同型之單雌生殖更番輪廻——單雙組染色僶輪廻之單雌生殖。　　（五）單組染色體的單雌生殖所演發之雄裔，其精子不再經减數分裂（精原細胞與精子內之染色體數目相同）而雙組染色體的單雌生殖之雄裔，2N—1（2）其所產精子，恒有二類，一類具Z染色體者，可與卵子配合，一類具Z—1（2）染色體者，槪歸退化。　　（六）單雌生殖所演發之雄裔，無論其來自單組染色體，或來自雙組染色體，其精子內惟有N染色體數者，可與卵子配合受精，故。由受精卵演發之子裔，統屬雌體　　（七）人工單雌生殖，其發育情形，遠不如天然單雌生殖之良好，胚體或不能充分發育，中途夭折，幸而能長成，則此種子裔，亦體弱難於有後。　　（八）人工單雌生殖之子裔，其性別決定，與天然單雌生殖之情形略同。由單組染色體演發而來者恒爲雄裔，由雙組染色體演發而來者雌雄裔均有之。、　　（九）脊推動物中營自然單雌生殖者，絕無僅有，用人工試驗（如蛙，魚）結果亦難達圓滿，故無法確定其子裔之性別，至於獸類中，用人工單雌生殖法，可促使卵子有分裂發育之傾向，但殊難望其能演發成爲一完善之胚胎，因無法配備胚體發育過程中所需要之生理條件也。〔完〕　　（註一）在習慣上有專營單雌生殖以繁孳後裔的，也有一個時期行單雌生殖，一個時期營兩性生殖，經常在更番輪廻的。　　（註二）在棘皮動物，軟體動物，環節動物等，縱使有天然單雌生殖之機遇，大都是畸形的發育，不易成爲完整的胚胎。　　（註三）行單雌生殖之蚜虫，體內之染色體爲8A+2X未經减數分裂之卵，仍爲8A+2X經减數者則爲4A+X雄裔所生之精子，雖有4A+X，及4A+0兩種，惟僅4A+X之一類精子，得與卵子配合受精，受精卵內爲8A+2X故又演發爲雌。蚜虫有兩類不同之雌體，一類是單雌生殖以胎生法繁衍之雌裔，無受精囊不適於與雄體交配，直接演發成雌虫，一類是兩性生殖，以卵生法繁衍之雌裔。有受精囊，可接受雄體的精虫。　　（註四）據實驗證明海胆卵，經人工單雌生所演發之子裔，亦僅具半數染色體。如海胆之一種Stronglyocentrotuslividus，親體之雌，有36染色體。子裔僅爲18個。馬糞海胆之一種Sphaetechinus　granularls，原有40色體，子裔僅20個刺海胆中之Echinuses　culentus，原有36個染色體，子裔僅19個。　　（註五）因細胞分裂時缺少中心體及星射綫，（兩者係使子細胞核遠離與按常規分佈的重要嚮導）故子細胞核常有互相融合而成雙組核或多組核者，發育有時不能正常，原因在此。麝香  賈醉公　　　　我國西南部的高原地帶，如靑海，西康，西藏，雲南等省的山中，盛產着一種小形的食草動物，其雄者的身上，能散發出濃烈的香氣，常使所到之處，芬郁撲鼻，經久不散，這種動物的名字呌做麝，所發出的香氣，就是麝香。　　在動物學上，麝是屬於脊椎動物門哺乳綱有蹄目的。牠的形狀像鹿，但通常皆比鹿小，體高不過一尺半左右。全身被灰黑或赤黃色的短毛。後肢長於前肢，善跳躍並適於登山。尾短小，下埀時僅能掩蓋住尾下的肛門。雌雄都無角，頭頂只豎立着一雙長大的耳殼。雄者上顎頗發達，有細長的犬齒露出口外，畏約三寸；其腹部陰囊的近旁，有一鳩卵形的香腺，含於皮下，名爲麝香囊，麝所散發的香氣，就是由這個器官裏分泌出來的·　　麝終年棲息於山林的高地，至夏季常見其生活於更高之處。晝伏夜出，以草葉苔蘚等植物爲食。胃分四囊，有反芻性，和家畜中的牛相似·性懦怯，當受驚或遇敵時，必跳躍逃遁。繁殖力甚强，每胎可產四子，四子常不產於一處。雄者至交尾時期，香腺更爲發達，香氣濃烈刺鼻，藉以引誘雌者來與牠交尾；原來這是雄者在生殖方面的一種本能。　　雄麝生長至二三齡時，香腺即開始分泌香質，但其整個的香囊，重不過二三錢。嗣後香囊漸漸膨大，分泌的香質亦漸濃厚；至七八齡時，香囊可重二兩以上，獵者或飼者至此時期，乃設法捕殺牠；用刀將香囊連腹皮割下，割時須注意勿使香囊破裂，乾燥後即成麝香。　　麝香因爲是用這種簡陋的方法製取的，所以常有皮毛等物混雜其中。純者新鮮時質軟如膏，色較淡；乾燥後即變成黑褐色的塊狀。不過它的色質亦常因氣候的不同而轉變，如冬季多爲黃褐色的粉末，入夏則變爲銀灰色的液汁，曝於烈日中，即呈黑粉狀；但通常在保藏妥善而作棗紅色者，是爲最優良的品質。　　麝香的功用，可作香料和藥料。用作香料時，以雜拌入烟絲與食品中或爲化裝品化的原料爲主；用作藥料時，則爲興奮劑或回甦藥。中國麝香之品質最佳者，產於西康境內的金砂江流域；而西康省　麝香產量，亦爲全國冠，所以西康省每年都有大量的麝香外銷。至於該省每年究能出產若干，則漫無統計，在抗日戰爭中，更無法調查實數，不過據邊關的麝香歲收（値百抽五）來估計，抗戰開始後的翌年（民二十七），該省麝香的總產量，約爲一千〇七十七斤七兩，總値當時的國幣約三千一百餘萬元，由此可見一斑。</p>

<p>自由談平等與自信  請文　　　　人與人之間是否可能建立眞正的平等關係？這是一個猶未獲　解決的問題。主張法治的人認爲人人應在法律前面平等，注重經濟理論的人則又認爲唯有在經濟生活的解放下，始可獲得人人平等，而宗敎家則穴揚唯有在上帝而前人才是平等的。　　就自然現象言；人是天生不平等的，例如男女之間就有性別的約束，而在一般人之間，亦有天賦能力的差別。有些人天資聰慧，有些人生來低能。敎育雖能補救一部份，但同一學校中的學生，雖受同樣的敎育，而仍不免有優劣高低之分。　　當然，一般所謂的平等，是指的人與人間的社會關係而非自然關係。所謂法律前面平等或經濟前面平等云云，都是要求社會關係平等的呼聲。我相信隨社會的進化，人與人間的平等關係是一定能夠完成的。不過這裏有一個相對的看法。　　平等的要求，自然起於先有一不平等的存在，而不平等的基礎就是特權。譬如中世紀地主與農奴的關係，就是地主享受特權太多。那時的農奴不僅無平等可言，且根本不受人的看待，而祗是地主的動產之一罷了。這才是不平等之尤。不過這種情形，在現代世界中究竟是很少有的了。　　因此，要求平等，非先消除不平等的原因不可，也就是人人先要泯除爭取特權的心理。然而現在每見許多人要求平等，祗從片面的權利着想，旣忽略了義務的一面，也不顧及他人的權利。像階級革命一類的理論，就是如此。因階級革命雖然推翻了一部份人的特權，而代之以起的却是一種新的特權，社會關係依舊沒有平等可言。　　也許有人會說，多數人而享有特權，就是巡得了平等，因爲世界上本不能做到絕對平等的。這種話粗看似乎有幾分道理，可是事實吿訴我們的却不然。譬如說各盡所能，各取所需這兩句口號，試問現在世界的那一國中已經實行了？無論在那一種社會制度的國家中，個人的生活豈非仍舊取決於個人的社會地位和其能力嗎？而且能够做到這樣，已經算是進步的了。　　那麽，照你這樣說法，你是不相信人類有平等可能的了？不過這也不然。我認爲平等與不平等，一半間然是在實生活，一半却是起於心理的自卑。實生活的平等自然是必要的，這即是人人在經濟與法律前面的平等，不過這是一條迂迴曲折的路，不是馬上能够走到的。譬如說經濟平等，在一國言，必須先求國家的生產發達，在世界言，必須世界的經濟富裕。而法律前面的平等，　一半要以經濟生活的平等爲先決條件，一半則猶待於敎育的力量，即養成人人有守法的精神。而這也是實施民主的一個基本條件。　　但另一半起於心理自卑的不平感，實起於人的自己錯覺。譬如說做夥計的人，對於老闆往往有所顧忌，小職員們對於上司亦往往存有旣妬忌又自卑的心理。以爲職位與身份的上下，就是不平等。要是在此心理，則我敢說人類世界永遠不會有平等。因爲無論在怎樣講求經濟平等與法律平等將來社會中，職位的上下之　是將永遠存續的。這與平等問題並無關係。　　消滅由於心理錯覺的不平感，唯一的方法，就是自信自尊與不亢不卑。要知現在　社會雖未完全平等，然而人與人的自然關係，除了各自的特殊天賦外，本來是平等的。世界上祗有畸形的人，却沒有眞的超人。我們應該尊重某人的能力與經驗，但却無須另眼相看，更用不到畏懼·更不用因畏懼而自感卑賤，而致感到心理上的不平等。　　世界上最初原無所謂特權人物，祇是因爲一部份人在某種心理的錯覺下硬將他人捧上七層天，而被捧者於不知不覺間了民居然自視爲超人·歷來的帝王思想便是這樣來的。譬如日本的皇帝在戰時曾被日本奉若神祗，但如今就連他本人對此也覺得可笑了。如果人人能在心理上抱有平等的自信心，這才是眞正走上了平等的大路。求職難  葉君　　　　照理，我現在還是「求知」的時候，不是「求職」的時候，但是爲了生活上的「求吃」，便不得不在求知時求一職，所謂半工半讀者是也。　　說起求職，談何容易。據我自己的經驗，求職有三難；有的職業是難在「吃不消」，譬如工程人才，機械人才，技術人才，社會上供不應求，但我無此等專門技能，幹不了，這是一難。有的職業是難在「得不到」，工作本身並不難，譬如各機關的普通公務員，所做的事多爲擬擬　稿，抄抄公文，收發信件，甚納銀錢，檢驗設件，登記事項……等，有何難哉，但是你要想得一此等工作，便需廣大的神通，像我這等初出茅廬的忠厚小子，休作妄想，這是又一難。有的職業是難在「難爲情」，譬如擦皮鞋，當練習生，做三輪車夫，做侍者等，不但有時待遇優渥，而且都不需什麽奇才異能，像我這種角色，也必能勝任愉快的；但我是一個受高等敎育的人，若居然操此營生，親朋戚友不要鄙我太無出息了麼？　　難爲情，這是第三種難。　　有此三難，怎能够滿足我的「三求」？化些時間去旅行  陳烟帆　　　　讀某報副刊有一譯自雜誌文摘的短文，說；「化些工夫　來做人。」裏面有「化些工夫來遊戲—這是永遠年靑的秘訣。」「化些工夫來閱讀—這是智慧的泉源。」「化些工夫來夢想—這可使你的心智遠走高飛。」「化些工夫來工作。「和「化些工夫來戀愛，」「化些工夫來帮助人」等。這樣，人的一生就是把工夫分配給各種零碎的事情。　　化些工夫來做人，是的，做人得化些工夫；這上面的工夫二字似乎和時間又有一些分別。時間是誰都化了的，而工夫却也有人不化。有的人過了五十年，他的人生很充實。另外一個人同樣活了五十年，也許祗是匆匆一瞥　　那篇短文裏面沒有說及「化些工夫去旅行—可以得到某某好處。」我想，旅行有時候實在是比夢想和閱讀更爲有益。我所說的時間二字，則實際也含有「工夫」二字的意義在內，而並非化了時間匆匆一瞥。三十四年冬天以後，我到東北去了二年多，除了不能去的地方以外，給我走過的地方要佔了多數。近來東北局勢愈演愈緊，則當時走過的地方現在都成了記憶中的印蹟。吉林長春像大海中的珊瑚島一樣，現在可別想去了。安東，鳳凰城，公原，本溪好像都已陸沉。鴨綠江上靜靜的碧淸的流水，鎭江山上滿山的花樹，和安　綫上巍峨連綿的山峯，不　要到什麼時候才能重要了，　　　　旅行這一件事是我國人一向不主張的。現在這年頭談旅行的人更其少了。原因是窮人們（現在不窮的人也很少了·）應付生活都透不過氣來。富人們雖然金倏堆得如同柴爿，還在忙着怎樣使它增加得更多的事業。旅行又有什麼好處呢？　　不主張旅行的人說：「在家千日好，出門寸步難。」還有一句古詩說：「憐君何事到天涯。」上面一句不知說什麽，大的是形容外面的辛苦。說什麽事情使你一跑得這麽遠呢？　苦是一苦的，然而快樂也往往從苦由得來。早晨呵出的氣在棉被上凝冰的長春，四月天氣給太陽照着的河岸上時有「嘩啦」一聲一塊塊巨大的冰坍下米的溝帮子。那情景使我想起古德孟孫描寫的冰島。還有晴空蒼藍，雪山迤邐的榆關。望夜裏從火車上下來，公原彷彿是荒野，聶立天表的平頂山，和可愛的小旅店的燈火。我常恨自已沒有更多機會去走遍西北高原，西南山川。一座山，一灣水，一個不同地方的人物和住屋，所可以給你的知識意味或者可以比一本好書更多，祗在乎你的研究興趣怎樣。　　住在上海的人們說到到旅行或者便想起杭州或蘇州。遠一點的或者是普陀，南京，或北平。我的意思是旅行不一定要到著名的地方去。不著名的地方或甚至沒有好風景的地方也可以。這是一點。第二，旅行不需要很闊，一般人以爲旅行是有錢人的勾當，所以常以沒有充分的錢而欲行又止。第三，乘船不需要買特等房間，乘車也無需乎頭等，有時可以買三等船票，上早道時，驢車或獨輪車不但可以將就，而且饒有趣味。旅行中如有樂天的精神，則簡陋的享受，狹小的旅店常常也可毫無影響。　　我再要重複一句的是：「旅行不一定要揀好風景的地方去。」優秀的杭州固然可去，荒凉的北方也可走走，葱綠的江南自然是美的，駱駝黃沙的塞外也別有一格。並不僅限春秋是旅行的季節；冬天好去見見冰雪萬里的關外，夏天我倒希望到南方的椰子林下去嗜嗜火熱的滋味。逍遙花  陳慎言　　萍水姻緣（九一）　　　　就目前情形，花北平有這一塲風波，實在無顏駐足，要想生存，必須離開北平，才有川路，但是這梨園生涯，幹得好可以名利雙收，幹得不好，要身敗名裂，將來自己應取如何途徑，現在毫無把握。要想再在梨園界活動，非易地另下一番苦工不可，並且年華巳大，這舞台生活，還能混得幾年？除舞台生活之外，只有出嫁，平日所物色如意郞君，祗有渚齋一人，他最誠實，最漂亮，不想他家庭中又發生了問題！這目的又成幻想。此時前望前途茫茫，進退失據，不知如何是好。綺紈正在觸景感傷，痴立廊前，突見一人，穿着一身白色的衣服，由東頭一間病室裏，慢慢走了過來。暮色微茫裏，廊上又無燈火，綺紈看不淸是什麽人，以爲是醫院看護，毫不注意。及到那人走到面前，才知道不是看護，有意無意中，看了他一眼，覺得這人面目俊秀，雪白臉孔，眉梢眼角，很有點像渚齋，只是比渚齋稍爲胖一點，矮一點，好生面善，一時記不起來，似在那裘見過，不由又向他看了一眼，那人湊近一步，微笑道：「你是顧小姐嗎？大槪不認得我，我是劉島雲·」綺紈一聽「劉烏雲」三字，不由很驚訝的，向他又看了一眼，劉島雲名字熟得很，常在銀寡上見他表演，這時無意中，會在醫院遇見他，殊出意外。島雲見綺紈沉疑不語，說道「顧小姐好久沒露演，可是顧小姐的戲，我可看過不少，只是我在台下，顧小姐在台上，彼此都沒接談過。可是顧老太太，我在上海常見面。」綺紈道：「劉先生，久仰得很，我們雖然沒有接談，可是神交已久，劉先生在銀幕上，我見過無數次，劉先生表演的藝術，我非常佩服。」島雲道：「逢塲偶爾游戲而已，不比顧小姐家學淵源，一切都有根底。我只恨我沒有嗓子，什麼都可以勉强學到，只有京戲一門，爲嗓音所限，無法學習。」美國的教師恐慌  許津津　　　　據美國新聞雜誌最近的報導，美國的小學敎育，目前正面臨空前的危機。小學敎師鑒於薪水菲薄，學校設備間陋，紛紛改就他職，出缺的職位，不易找人塡補。美國的不少年輕男女不願攻習師範科，他們寗願接受收入較　，却比較不長進的工作。　　現在美國各州內的高中或高　以下的畢業生，均發給臨時證書，讓他們去敎書·一處學校中因爲敎員人手不敷，往往兩班併一班上課。出缺的敎師六萬人，始終沒有人來補充。有的地方，不得不找出天資聰明的學生，來指點他的同學。有的地方，額外的功課，由留職的敎師分別担任。　　這一種情形發生在美國戰後第一代小國民開始受敎育的時候，他們日後將要在原子時代中成長及工作，其嚴重性，不問可知。　　按美國敎師的待遇，頗爲淸苦。其薪水係由法律規定，這幾年來，生活程師日高，收入則相形見絀·一般工人的工資較一九三九年增加百分之七十九，而敎師的束修僅提高百分之三十一。事實上，一九四一年間，敎師的平均年俸爲一千四百七十元，至　一九四六年七月，敎師須用二千百元，才能買得到一九四一年一問價値一千四百七十元的東西，一何况美國自去年七月以來，生活指數又上升百分之七·五呢。　　目前，美國敎師　平均年俸迫近二千元，但是此數包括校長，訓育主任及商級職員等薪給在內。換一句話說，美國半數以上的敎師收入還不滿二千元。　　有　敎師，薪金更遠遜此數。在敎育落後的密西西比區內，一半以上的敎師，年俸不到八百四十二元。又如亞千薩斯區內，半數以上的敎師年俸不滿九百十八元。餘如浮琴尼·密蘇里·肯泰基·潭尼西等州的敎師待遇，大半在一千五百元以下。　　在這種情形之下，敎師仍不得不在外兼職或另作別圖，以維生計。美國原有敎師九十萬人，自從一九三九年以來，已有三十五萬人離職他去。退職的人數仍在不斷增加中。　　凡是未離職的敎師們，以前在課餘尙能潛心進修，現在往往朱找額外工作。華盛頓市郊某小學校長前年夏季做了一個暑假的漆匠，去年冬季則在郵政局內兼職。別的敎師也有在課餘兼充木匠，跑街，在工廠和夜總會中工作，或充農夫的助手，卡車司機，和當酒館招待的。　、敎師們發現，課室以外的酬報，比執敎優厚。公共汽車司機，成衣匠和電話接綫生等的最低工資，都在敎師的最低薪金之上。譬如說，華盛頓市內的公共汽車司機，純過一個月的訓練後，平均每星期可收入六十元，即全年共計收入三千一百二十元。而一個師範生在華盛頓讀完四年大後，最初任職時的薪俸却要比車夫少去五百七十元至七百七十元。　　美國敎師處此境况下，因爲生活費　高漲，各地常有罷敎事件發生。甚至在樸茨茅斯，聖保羅等城市內，敎師亦以罷敎為要挾。餘如台頓，紐凱　爾，哈德福等地，亦有醞釀風潮的可能。聞美國教育當局對此尙應付的善策。有幾位經驗豐乎富的敎育家說，目前的小學敎育情形固然已很嚴重，但將來說不定更有令人扼腕的現象發生呢！登華頂  施叔範　　　　華頂爲天台山最高處，可眺東海。上有太白樓，右軍洗硯池，智者拜經台，僧衲指吿，語多不經。山高風大，束稻藥蓋屋，皆厚逾半丈，避日禦雪，冬夏咸宜，望之　綠流黃，奇觀也—往客亦城，頗事攀躋，距今蓋已星舟霜三換矣。春燈孕碧，庭草又生，比輒神遊其境，夜有所夢，醒紀以詩。靑峯盡處海涵渾，直北黃雲戰馬屯，骨俗還容登上界，山商每易見中原。危檣日出尋常事，迂士墨流肺腑痕；暫坐荒寒傾茗椀，此非廊廟莫輕論。　　太白樓吞大野寬，枯茅一丈積檐端，聽他猿烏愁何極？對此江山粱亦難！誓墓人來雲脚散，拜經僧死石頭殘。登臨便作南雷想，浩蕩晨曦意最丹。舊都的花樓  清雷學圖　　　　北平已於年初明令定爲「陪都」，關心此間情况者當不在少數，昔年隨國都南移衆友，必更縣念不已。前接半夢詩翰「一往屯　憑茗洗，」「淸狂常說舊開天，」註「向在北都每星期必茗叙靑雲閣。」此不只夢翁爲然，江南人喜品茶，昔“舊都各茶肆座上客，惟吾蘇爲盛。本人特將近十餘年之變遷作一概述。書鮑明遠蕪城賦驚心動魂，狀物入神，非拙筆所敢望，而紀實情，借憑弔之意則，讀者鑒之。　　舊京的「茗叙」之所，大致兩種：（一）是「茶館兒」，街頭巷尾，民衆市塲，隨處可見，一兩間矮屋，排些板凳，條几，負販之徒，說媒拉縴，帮閒了事之客，以爲休息會談之地。門口掛著一條條的紙幌，上寫「雨前」毛尖，龍井·香片」等等，其在大會塲如天橋一帶，以席搭蓋，性質略同。這些茶館茶棚，充滿了地方Local色彩·湫隘龐雜·中上級的雅人文士是無從涉足，亦不層光顧的。（二）是茶樓，起於淸季興辦新式商業，至民國初年，單計前門以西大柵欄左右繁華區　幾條街，有觀音寺中間之靑雲閣，東首之賓宴樓，廊房頭條路南之第一樓，路北之勸業場，各有樓三層迎屋頂爲四層，共茶座設於三層，帶賣點心及便餐，下兩層則各式商店小間與小攤櫛次麟比，似小市塲，又似百貨公司。品茗者，或憑欄俯視，或循行游覽，選購珍玩及合用之物，時而與三五良朋，聚坐談天，時而聽鄰座他人演說異鄕風物，半日消閒，足可賞心悅目，優哉游哉。　　各樓皆屢經火患，再修再造。惟「靑雲閣」數十年屹處鬧市中心，未受祝融之厄，其建築亦特別淸整雅潔，門額三字何維樸書，作顏體，甚壯觀，係何蝯叟（紹基）後人，　有家法。樓上茶坐名「玉壺春」，有散坐，有雅坐，明窗凈几，全無俗氣，爲個中翹楚，爲魯殿靈光，然而近十餘年由末運走人絕運。淪陷期中，倭人收買全部，改做一個甚麼「寮」（日本名詞，平市除佛寺之「知客　」外，從未見於市面），非復游覽交易之所，前後門亦不可通行（後門在楊梅竹斜街）。光復後，我方接收，爲平津鐵路員工宿舍。昨往前門，路經此處，徘徊瞻望，回想昔年與半夢，靜齋，武會，省甫，定甫，浩齋，遂初諸兄座談之樂，恍如隔世，不覺愴然涕下。其東之賓宴樓則改爲舖店及貨棧，第一樓在七七變前已經閉歇。滿目塵封，惟勸業塲因屬於官廳，得其支援，尙能存在。塲內各商在蕭修狀態中掙扎，而茶社酒肆則無一存者。城內較爲繁華之東安市塲，及西單商塲，昔日茗叙之處，今亦不可復得，惟有一二票友坐唱之所，其所收座錢亦名「茶錢」，而鑼鼓喧鬧，歌聲震耳，非品茶淸話所宜。　　一老昔年茶樓盛况，因是都城所在，各省人士求名求利，集向中心，往來不絕，在平無專職而多閒暇，借此消　長晝，即各機關人員，遇星期及休假，亦常約會盤桓。南城本是妓院戲園，飯店業集之區，所謂笙歌匝地，鼓吹沸天。聚集朋侶，每以茶樓爲樞紐，其不喜繁耨或經濟力不足留戀烟花之士人，亦藉茗談消遣，此茶樓業之所以盛極一時也。　　國都南遷以後，百業　微，最受影響者即是茶樓。有職的紛紛隨機關南下，謀職的不來，茶樓的收入便如無源之水，以至添設唱曲，說書，雜要之類，藉以號召。這比當年茶樓已經變質。乃至最稱雅靜的靑雲閣，亦鼓聲咚咚，絃子胡琴鬧得不亦樂乎，仍然不能持久·七七事變後，日人即趁便收爲彼有，全樓上下各家老板捲堂大散，即樓的主人雖然得到相當代價，但多年美業，一旦虛空，亦可憐了。　　淪陷初期商戶蕭條，日人大投房產之機，遇空房或衰落店主，即强買硬收，多數改爲旅館。入後日人來者旣多，華人在鄕村彼烽火所擾，復回都市，住宅不敷，旅館人滿，日人大發其財，直至勝利來到，乃踉蹌回國。社會服務讀者諮詢　法律釋疑　父母作主代訂婚約　兒子反對擬行解除　　孫子系間敝友某甲未滿二十歲，即由父母作主與乙女訂婚，當時曾付聘金卅萬元，訂婚後，乙女即來上海讀書，但乙女不求上進，無意求學，三月未滿，即返鄕。現甲已二十一歲，與丙女相戀，願偕白首，並徵得家長同意擬與乙方解除婚約，但乙方置之不理一味延宕，請問（一）甲方擬解除婚約，乙方不理，　內是否可以擅自結婚？（二）解除婚約時，甲方可否向乙方索回聘金禮品？（三）如乙方無經濟損失，是行有要求共他賠償之可能？　　〔曹亞俠律師答〕（一）甲方先行訂婚或再結婚，乃搆成民法第九七六條第一款他方得解除婚約情形之一，苟原來婚約係屬合法訂定，則無過失之一方，得向有過失之他方請求賠償其因此所受之損害。（二）未成年子女不同意父母代訂之婚約，依司法院一一七四號解釋一，其婚約當然無效，不生解除問題，禮品及禮金可以不當利得爲理由請求返還。（三）婚約旣依法當然無效，乙方不能要求賠償共精神上之損害·服務簡訊　　徵求書籍本報讀者王一一葦君欲徵求亞美公司出版之「無綫電週刋彙編」第三集，願出相當代價或以書籍交換，如有割愛者請函南京路五八七號王君洽。招尋失物本報讀者王桂英君於二月廿七日下午九時乘三輪車在靜安寺路一帶失落長方形白緬拉鍊女式手筒一只，內有法幣百餘萬元及鑰匙等另星物件，因該手筒係友人託帶，一時無法配購，深爲焦慮。如有仁人君子拾得者，請賜電八五一四六葛姓轉洽，王君略備薄酬，藉伸謝忱。郵政問答　　　茲收到（一）靑田李伯華君（二）本市浙江北路程棄疾君來函詢問，特就所提各點，簡答如下：　　（答）（甲）本市各郵政支局　可匯款。（乙）靑田信函由　州轉，星期日上午十時前投入信筒之郵件，恐不及趕交當日開溫之大華輪發出，惟該大華輪上裝有信箱，請在該輪啓椗前登輪投入，即可當班寄出。　　（二）郵局禁止交寄之物品，計」下列請類；一，物品之性質及其封裝足以污損郵件或傷害郵務人員者，（二）爆裂，引火，及其他危險物品。（三）生活之動物，但蜂蠶及水蛭可按包裹或貨樣寄遞。（四）海關應納稅之物品未經納稅，或以成批貨樣希　漏稅而交寄者。。鴉片烟，嗎啡，高根，及其他麻醉物品，但依法經主管機關特許者不在此例。（六）寄達國不許輸入或流行之物品，（七）關於淫邪有傷風化之物品。（八）政府禁止出版，發售及製造之物品。（九）彩票及與彩票有關之廣吿傳單，但經政府特許發行之彩票不在此例。（十）郵票無論蓋銷與州否，露封寄遞者，（十一）其他法令寄寄之物品。又上述述第（五）（七）（八）（九）各項之物品如係供訴訟證據之用，經司法官應備文證明相互寄遞者，可予收寄·兵役如有舞弊　查明不稍姑息　　　上海師管區司令部的稱：准貴欄轉下寳山縣城廂鎭第九保全體居民來函，提供有關該領兵役舞弊各情。查本部前據報，寳山縣辦理兵役有曰遵法食汚情事，業已派員澈查辦法。來件除巳轉飭該管團區查明糾正，如確實貪汚有據者，仍當依法嚴辦外；爾後各一地辦理兵役人員，如果有貪汚情事，可列具事實證據，逕向師區檢舉，經查明屬實者，決秉公處理，不稍姑息，務使役政推行，均能達到合理合法。仍盼轄區人民，深明本身之職責，中籤應征者，即自動報到入營服役，庶役政前途日臻至善。相應函復，即希查照為荷！此致甲報社會服務欄。招請書報推銷員　　　本市陝西南路體育館內社會服務處書報流通團招請書報推銷員四十名，凡淸寒學生及對文化工作有興趣之靑年，均可前往報名參加。</p>

Besides bandits approaching the southwest corner of the city near the airfield, another group is approaching the urban area from the north and northeast. The defending army is fiercely resisting the attacking bandits. (2) The vanguard of the National Army's southward advance troops in Liaoning has reached its predetermined area. The siege of Benxi can be lifted soon, and the recovery of Liaoyang is also imminent. The suppression of bandits in southern Liaoning will be the good news from the Northeast this spring. (3) Benxi, an important industrial and mining center southeast of Shenyang, was attacked on the 6th by bandits from the south and west, targeting the outer strongholds. Another group of bandits advanced from the Sijiatun to Benxi railway line at Waitoushan Station, attacking the Huolianzhai railway station west of Benxi. The National Army dispatched a large force from a certain location for reinforcement, so there are no concerns about Benxi.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency Changchun Dispatch, 7th] The National Army on both sides of the Liao River has gained a strategic advantage and is launching a capture operation to encircle and annihilate the main force of the bandits. A certain army corps of ours is currently advancing on separate routes and has made contact with the defending army in a certain area, preparing to launch a sweeping operation against the bandits.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency Shenyang Dispatch, 7th] The bandit force that infiltrated the Siping airfield launched an attack on the Xipu area west of Siping on the evening of the 5th under the cover of artillery fire. At the same time, bandit forces gathered east and northeast of Siping also started moving at dawn on the 6th. Our air force is currently cooperating with the ground defending forces to launch attacks in separate directions.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency Shenyang Dispatch, 7th] Our southward advance troops have made smooth progress in recent days. The remnants of bandits scurrying around Benxi have shown signs of wavering. To contain our defending army's offensive, the bandits launched an attack on Sanjiazi (west of Benxi) and Shijinling (south of Benxi) with a portion of their forces on the morning of the 5th, but were repelled. Another group of over a thousand bandits, on the morning of the 7th, scurried from the Waitoushan area towards the Dalianzhai (north of Benxi) National Army positions, and were also repelled.</p>

<p>Requests Recognition of the Northeast Issue</p>
<p>[Our Shenyang Dispatch, 7th] An editorial in the "Northeast People's Daily" on the 7th, titled "U.S. Aid and the Northeast," commented on the importance of U.S. aid to the Northeast's military. If the essence of the Northeast issue is thoroughly recognized, it should be known that U.S. military assistance is absolutely indispensable. The newspaper pointed out that Li Lisan went to a certain party for help in January last year and obtained equipment for 22 divisions. In addition, the CCP's Northeast Bureau had secretly agreed with the leader of the Korean Communist Party that over 100,000 Korean communists trained by a certain party in North Korea infiltrated the Northeast to fight, leading to a gradual reversal of the war situation in the Northeast. The newspaper continued: President Roosevelt's concessions at Yalta were deeply regrettable.</p>
<h3>Businessmen's Association Cables Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Support of MacArthur's Opinion</h3>
<p>[This City News] The National Federation of Business Associations believes that General Douglas MacArthur's recent cable to the House Foreign Affairs Committee, specifically pointing out that China's revival is premised on the early completion of the suppression of the rebellion, is truly insightful. The association specifically cabled Minister Wang of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Nanjing to express its support. The cable vaguely stated that MacArthur's vision is broad and his insights are accurate and essential, truly worthy of being a great world statesman. Furthermore, his pointing out that China's revival depends on whether the military can complete its task early is a sharp observation. (Regarding various news regarding U.S. parties' views on the issue of aid to China, see column one of page two.)</p>

The three elders are old and seemed unable to bear the hardship of a long flight. After getting off the plane and returning home, Ma Zhanshan almost fainted and closed his doors to visitors. According to Wan Fulin, the situation in the Northeast is like a patient: taking only one dose of medicine will not help. One must continue taking several doses and then rest to recover one's health. Zhang Zuoxiang will handle private affairs in Beiping and return to Tianjin in the next few days.</p>

This situation will be personally conveyed to the Chairman during the meeting. The second problem is that the issue of the circulating banknotes must be resolved. They are currently waiting for Zhang Jia'ao to come to Nanjing to negotiate in order to stabilize the Northeast economy. Wang and others paid respects to the mausoleum on the morning of the 7th and attended a dinner hosted by Yu Youren and Liu Zhe at noon. (Regarding suggestions for appointing talent from the Northeast, see column four of page two.)</p>

<p>Expresses Determination to Conduct Affairs Within Provincial Borders</p>
<p>[Our Shenyang Dispatch, 7th] The newly appointed Chairman of Liaobei Province, Xu Liang, is extremely anxious because the Siping airfield has fallen and he is unable to fly there. He has stated that he will lead cavalry to his post. If there are problems in Siping, he will definitely not handle Liaobei provincial affairs in Shenyang. Xu's intention is that Liaobei provincial affairs must be conducted within the borders of Liaobei Province. The current issues are the political coordination of military affairs, and the strength of local forces cannot be ignored. According to reports, Xu was previously in charge of reorganizing and training cavalry in Qian'an to return to the Northeast, and he also held an important position in the cavalry.</p>

According to reliable sources, a certain brigade of the National Army stationed in Shuyang has made a strategic retreat. Currently, the bandits show signs of moving towards the Tongyu line, but it is generally judged that this is a covering action by the bandits. If the bandits were to move in this direction, it would not have much significance. But for an army of 20,000 to march hundreds of li, there must be a very big plan.</p>

<h3>Main Task of This National Assembly: Elect the President and Vice President; Three Parties Conduct Consultations on the Issue of Candidate Nomination; Attending Delegates Report Starting on the 19th</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 7th] The National Assembly is approaching. According to sources from the Preparatory Committee, the main task of this assembly is to elect the President and Vice President.

However, the draft of the Legislative Yuan should have been submitted six months before the meeting, and the Legislative Yuan has not submitted a draft.

<h3>The Road to Democracy – A Dedication to the March 8th International Women's Day</h3>
<p>Today is the thirty-eighth International Women's Day, and also the first Women's Day in our country after the implementation of the Constitution. In a word, the women's movement is the movement of women's participation in politics, striving for freedom and equality between men and women in politics and economics. Therefore, this year's March 8th Women's Day is particularly worthy of our attention in China during the constitutional era.</p>
<p>The essence of commemorating an annual festival lies in a rigorous review of the past, self-alertness and self-encouragement, so that we can work harder in the future and move towards this lofty common goal. The significance of our commemoration of Women's Day is also to enable women all over the world to review the past and encourage the future on this day. Everyone knows the origin of International Women's Day. Thirty-eight years ago today, women in Chicago, USA, held a large-scale demonstration parade to strive for women's liberation, shouting slogans of political and economic equality between men and women. A year later, the second International Women's Congress was held in the capital of Denmark. The whole congress unanimously resolved to designate "March 8th" as International Women's Day, and put forward many proposals such as "equal pay for equal work," "protecting mothers," and "implementing an eight-hour work system." Since 1992, women in various countries around the world have held commemorative ceremonies every year on March 8th. Chinese women were relatively backward, and only began to hold this era-significant commemoration in 1924, which has now been 25 years of history.</p>
<p>Today, we take this opportunity to look back at the achievements of the international women's movement over the past forty years. We certainly cannot exaggerate and say that the women's movement in the past was a complete failure, but we also cannot allow exaggeration, saying that the women's suffrage movement has now reached its intended goals. Because on the surface, the constitutions of various countries in the world recognize the legal equality of men and women, and stipulate that women have the right to participate in politics. In particular, the new constitution of our country stipulates that the number of women elected in various elections shall be determined by law, and specifically guarantees that the number of women elected shall not be less than 20% of the total. It can be seen that women are not only equal to men, but also superior to men. However, in practice, the opportunities for women to participate in politics and their political and economic status in various countries are still inferior to those of men. Even in the UK and the US, where women's rights are most developed, women's status still depends on the continued efforts of women themselves. There are certainly many factors that contribute to this situation, but the most important ones are the traditions of society and the problems of women themselves. Especially women, in the status of women in civilized countries all over the world, are far behind.</p>
<p>We certainly cannot deny that Chinese women have made significant contributions to the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, but due to the lack of universal education, most women are still illiterate and do not know what the women's suffrage movement is all about. Although women in cities can hold rallies today to warmly commemorate March 8th Women's Day, most rural women do not know what "March 8th Women's Day" is. What they need is not the right to participate in politics, but basic life and knowledge. Therefore, the essence of the women's issue in China today should not be to strive for legal equality, but to strive for actual equality between men and women. Educated women account for only a small part of the women in our country. Therefore, the most basic work at present is to popularize women's education, to awaken them, and to enable them to actually participate in politics.</p>
<p>I remember that in the first year when "March 8th Women's Day" started in our country, the Founding Father Sun Yat-sen gave a speech to general educated women, calling on female compatriots across the country to thoroughly awaken, cooperate and unite, and work together for the revolution. This sacred instruction still contains infinite significance for the women across the country in our country, which has just begun to implement the Constitution. The completion of China's democratic politics depends on the joint participation of the people across the country; whether Chinese women can fully participate in politics is a major test of China's democratic politics. We hope that the women's suffrage movement in the future can penetrate into China's political democratization movement, so that these two movements can be combined into one, and at the same time achieve our intended goals. This year is the year of constitutional implementation in our country. We hope that female compatriots across the country will move forward in unison and take the road to democracy. However, the biggest obstacle to China's political democratization at present is the Communist bandits' military rebellion. Therefore, when commemorating March 8th Women's Day today, we must especially emphasize the importance of women's participation in the work of suppressing the rebellion and building the country. Everyone should understand that if the Communist bandits are not eliminated, the country will have no peace, then any empty talk about the women's suffrage movement will also feel meaningless!</p>

<p>[United Press Washington 7th] Well-informed sources said on the 7th: Recent developments indicate that extreme division has occurred among US officials regarding the quantity and type of aid to China. The division between military leaders and the State Department is plain to see. Marshal MacArthur and General Wedemeyer have successively provided testimony to the House Foreign Affairs Committee, apparently deeply believing that sufficient military aid must be provided to China in order to completely drive the Communist army out of the Northeast and North China. However, there is still no sign that the State Department intends to change its original position. State Department officials said: In addition to the already announced surplus military equipment for aid to China, there is no intention to provide further military equipment to the Chinese National Government.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency Washington 6th] When the US House Foreign Affairs Committee discussed the restrictive economic aid to China plan proposed by the State Department last week, it focused on discussing military aid to China to resist the Communist Party. Due to the support of senior US generals General MacArthur and General Wedemeyer, and their strong advocacy of military aid to China, the Foreign Affairs Committee paid more attention to this issue than to the Marshall Plan outline. When the eleven Democratic and fourteen Republican members of the committee listened to opinions on the issue of aid to China, they had different views on whether the CCP threatened the existence of the Chinese government and whether the success of the Communist Party was equal to the Soviet Union controlling China. The committee raised two important questions on the issue of military aid to China: (1) Are the Chinese National Army well-trained and able to make good use of the materials provided by the United States? Marshall's answer was "No." According to him, he visited China a few years ago, but some who advocated military aid to China and visited China after Marshall firmly believed that if the US military advisory group gave the Chinese National Army appropriate training (this training has not yet been approved by the country), the Chinese army would be very capable of this. (2) What kind of military aid does China need? If the United States does not actively participate in China's anti-Communist civil war in the military field, what is the maximum amount of US aid to China? To what extent and at what point in time will this military aid last? What resources can the United States provide to China? If the United States does not actually guarantee the political and military security of the Chinese government, to what extent will the United States intervene in the China issue? Most of the above questions were raised by Democratic members. Those who support military aid to China have made general answers to these questions, saying that China needs very little military aid except for ammunition, weapons, and some other equipment. The United States can take out the above items from its surplus materials on Pacific islands and supply them to China without affecting US domestic resources. As for the US involvement in China's civil war, General Wedemeyer, a senior planning officer of the US Army, pointed out that the United States does not need to participate in China's civil war, it only needs to provide the Chinese army with weapons, and they can complete the task. It is believed that once the drafts of the aid to China plan are prepared, when the Senate and House of Representatives begin formal debates, the two houses can discuss whether the military aid to China plan and the economic aid to China plan should be combined.</p>
<h3>Rooks Will Attend Aid to China Bill Review Meeting</h3>
<p>Rumsey Agrees to Military Aid to China</p>
<p>[Central News Agency Washington 6th] According to what the Central News Agency reporter learned today: When the US House Foreign Affairs Committee's Aid to China Review Meeting reconvenes on the 8th, UNRRA Director Rooks will attend to state his opinions. Other people scheduled to attend to state their opinions include UNRRA China Branch Director Eggerton, former US Ambassador to China Cohn, and current members of the Export-Import Bank Board. According to congressional sources, when the committee holds a closed-door executive meeting on the 8th, CIA Director Hillenkoetter will provide insider information on the situation in China regarding the aid plan.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency Honolulu 6th United Press] US Pacific Fleet Commander Rumsey recently returned to Pearl Harbor after a two-week tour of military bases in the Far East. It is said that he strongly agrees with MacArthur's statement that "China needs both military and economic assistance," and said that in terms of the current international situation, Pacific defense is quite adequate, "but the situation is not immutable."</p>
<h3>Wong Wen-hao Arrives in Shanghai</h3>
<p>Discusses Key Work of the Resources Commission</p>
<p>To Increase Production and Exports</p>
<p>[This City News] Chairman of the Resources Commission Wong Wen-hao came to Shanghai yesterday on official business. The reporter rushed to meet him and asked about the Resources Commission's business operations in various places. Wong replied: "Important news has been published in the newspapers at any time and need not be repeated. What I can tell you is that the Resources Commission is now focusing on the following three points in promoting its work:</p>
<p>(1) To increase the production of materials, such as bituminous coal. All provinces along the Yangtze River have coalfields with excellent coal quality. In the past, due to insufficient manual labor, the quantity and use depended on coal from the north, which was transported over long distances. The Resources Commission is now selecting several coal mines in Hunan and Jiangxi provinces, transporting and installing various related equipment such as power generation and water pumping to increase coal production to meet urgent needs. All the effects are now increasing month by month. Another example is steel. In the past, the Anshan Iron and Steel Plant in the Northeast was the largest production base. Recently, it was temporarily lost due to the Communist bandits' attacks. The Resources Commission has a foundation for producing coal and iron in Peiping and making steel in Tianjin in recent years. It is now producing seriously to meet needs. Central China and South China produce iron ore with good quality, but they have not been smelted due to the lack of coking coal. The Resources Commission will build immediately and promote it simultaneously with coking coal to establish a new foundation.</p>
<p>(2) To increase export trade, the Resources Commission has been handling the export of tungsten, antimony, tin and other minerals for debt repayment and barter trade for many years. Recently, Taiwan sugar has increased in production and is being vigorously promoted to Japan and Nanyang. In addition, the first export of cement to the Philippines has begun. The domestic production volume is rapidly increasing, so the number of cement exports will also be further increased to increase the substantive contribution to the balance of international payments.</p>
<p>(3) To improve the efficiency of industrial and mining enterprises, commodity prices and wages in our country have risen significantly after the war, resulting in a significant increase in production costs. In order to improve the health of the industrial economy, we must effectively improve work efficiency so that the capacity and quantity of production can be improved, and the burden of materials and labor can be reduced. The Resources Commission is now supervising various units to work hard in this direction.</p>
<h3>Petition Group Submits Proposals for the Appointment of Talents from the Northeast</h3>
<p>Submits a Letter to Dean Tai Requesting Swift Implementation</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Nanjing 7th] Regarding the appointment of talents from the Northeast and the recognition of academic qualifications of young people from the Northeast, the Northeast People's Petition Group reported to the Central Standing Committee on March 3rd. On the 7th, it submitted a letter to Dean Tai Jitao, requesting a speedy approval and implementation. Minister of Education Chu Chia-hua will host a luncheon for the group on the 8th, and Dean Tai will also attend to discuss this issue. The petition group's letter to Dean Tai is as follows: "Our group is entrusted by the entire people of the Northeast to come to Beijing to petition. In addition to strengthening the military, political, and economic aspects related to saving the current crisis, we have submitted requests to the relevant authorities. In particular, as the situation becomes increasingly dangerous, winning people's hearts is even more important. Therefore, the appointment of talents from the Northeast is related to the country's long-term plan. When our group attended the Central Standing Committee meeting on March 3rd, we proposed that the academic qualifications of students who graduated from public and private middle schools and above in the Northeast provinces and cities since the founding of the Republic of China until the fall of the Northeast are not registered with the central government due to the special circumstances of the environment and the central government's inability to implement its policies. However, we found that this situation is purely a political relationship and should not affect the future of talents. We request that their academic qualifications be equivalent to the same effective qualifications as domestic public and private schools recognized by the Ministry of Education and be allowed to take higher examinations, ordinary examinations, and special examinations in various subjects. At that time, the Standing Committee resolved to adopt it. We are deeply gratified that Your Excellency attended the Standing Committee meeting and provided a lot of support. We hereby submit it again, respectfully requesting a speedy approval and implementation to value talents and maintain people's hearts. We are anxiously awaiting orders."</p>

<h3>Our Large-Scale Fertilizer Powder Factory Gradually Resumes Its Former Glory</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency Nanjing 7th] Our country's only large-scale fertilizer powder factory, Yongli Sulfo-Ammonia Factory, is gradually recovering from the eight years of destruction and damage by the enemy to the scale it had when it was established in 1937. Yongli Chemical Industry Company, under the planning of the late chemical giant Fan Xudong in 1934, decided to establish an ammonium sulfate factory in Xiejiadian, Liuhe County, Jiangsu Province, near the capital, in order to develop China's chemical industry. After hard preparations, it officially started construction in the spring of 1937. Soon after the outbreak of the Anti-Japanese War, it was bombed three times by enemy planes. In December of the same year, the factory site was occupied. The enemy occupied the factory for eight years. However, because all the factory blueprints and records were moved to the rear, the Japanese were able to partially start work after more than two years of speculation. The newest sulfuric acid factory model was completely moved to Japan. At the beginning of the victory, although the former general manager of the company, Fan Xudong, unfortunately passed away, under the leadership of his successor, chemical expert Hou Debang, personnel were sent to Beijing to prepare for resumption of work. After difficult repairs, it was able to report shipment again in July 1946. Currently, it produces more than 130 tons of fertilizer powder per day, which is close to the factory's scheduled quantity. According to the person in charge of the factory, the government and UNRRA have provided great assistance in this resumption of work. If the new UNRRA machinery worth one million US dollars can be installed in two to two and a half years, the factory's output will double at that time. The nitric acid factory machinery seized by the enemy will also be shipped back from Japan, and the future development of the factory can be predicted.</p>

The provincial government plans to mobilize 10,000 refugees with labor capacity to reclaim 300,000 mu of old wasteland near Bing City in accordance with the Ministry of Agriculture's measures to encourage civil reclamation. A Refugee Reclamation Administration has been established, planning to allocate 10 to 20 mu of vegetable land to each person. The reclamation will be completed during the spring plowing period. During the reclamation period, each person will be given two sheng of millet per day. It is estimated that 42,000 shi of millet will be needed in the seven months from reclamation to harvest. According to the current grain price in Bing City, approximately 252 billion yuan is needed. The provincial government has telegraphed the Executive Yuan, the Four Joint Relief Agencies, the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, and other relevant parties to approve the above-mentioned refugee reclamation loan of 252 billion yuan to relieve the victims and increase production.</p>

<h3>Dutch and Luxembourg Representatives Return Home for Instructions The Brussels Conference Continues Today The Form of the Western European Alliance Treaty is Yet to be Determined The Principle of Common Defense is Under Negotiation</h3>
<p>[Reuters Brussels Sixth Dispatch] It is known that several important matters were discussed at today's five-nation Western European alliance conference. Representatives from the Netherlands and Luxembourg will return to their countries immediately to seek instructions from their governments. According to British Ambassador to Belgium Rendel after the meeting, some clauses in the draft treaty were discussed today and still need to be referred to their home governments for instructions. The next meeting will be held on Monday, but the delegations will hold private talks on Sunday. French Ambassador Oudry de Crouy also said that there would be no significant developments in the conference before Monday. Although the countries have reached an agreement, the question is in what form this agreement should be presented.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse Brussels Sixth Dispatch] The impression among the participants is that a consensus has been reached on the general outline of the future treaty, but the actual form and legal wording of the final treaty remain to be considered. There are three ways to form the treaty: (1) a bilateral agreement; (2) a four-party agreement signed by the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg, as well as France, the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg; (3) a multilateral agreement signed by the five powers. The latter agreement is the most popular because it includes many aspects and opens the door to other countries. The treaty will cover political and economic aspects, with economic aspects being particularly important to the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg. The treaty does not include a concrete plan for military cooperation, but will stipulate the principle of joint defense against aggression, as in the "Petropolis" Inter-American Treaty.</p>
<p>[Reuters Brussels Sixth Dispatch] The British Embassy told our agency that although the draft treaty of the five countries of the United Kingdom, France, the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg does not stipulate details of the military part, the principle of joint defense is being discussed. According to people close to the delegation, the memorandum submitted by the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg will serve as the preamble to the five-nation treaty, and the articles will be a compilation of the articles from the British-French draft and the Dutch-Belgian-Luxembourg draft. According to reliable sources, the issue of Italy's participation in the Western European alliance was discussed at today's meeting, but Italy will only participate after the five countries of the United Kingdom, France, the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg sign the treaty.</p>
<h3>Bevin Plans to Discuss with Western European Countries to Expand the Scope of the Alliance The Five-Nation Treaty Can Be Signed in the Short Term</h3>
<p>[Reuters London Seventh Dispatch] Official sources claim that Foreign Secretary Bevin and Foreign Minister Bidault will go to Beijing to sign the five-nation Western European alliance treaty before or after the European sixteen-nation conference is convened in Paris on March 15. It cannot be determined now, depending on whether the five-nation delegation currently negotiating in Beijing can complete the draft agreement by the middle of next week. If the Western European Treaty is completed before the opening of the sixteen-nation conference in Paris, it has two advantages: one is to provide concrete evidence that Western Europe has decided to integrate its policies and economic strength, and the other is to provide the countries participating in the Marshall Plan with a basis for expanding the possibility of a Western European alliance. Observers are convinced that Foreign Secretary Bevin will take advantage of the opportunity of the sixteen-nation representatives gathering in Paris to hold informal talks with the foreign ministers of some of these countries to listen to their opinions on the future relations of Western Europe. Italian Foreign Minister Sforza and Swedish Foreign Minister Undén will be the people whom Bevin hopes to have informal discussions with on the possibility of expanding the Western European alliance. Recent news from Beijing stated that the five-nation Western European alliance treaty will keep the door open so that any European country willing to participate can do so. The biggest difficulty in expanding the five-nation treaty is that neutral countries such as Sweden and Switzerland are unwilling to participate in any treaty with military obligations. Therefore, it is expected that the clauses in the five-nation treaty drafted in Beijing concerning security guarantees will be stipulated in the most general terms to make it easier for other countries to participate. As for the five countries of the United Kingdom, France, the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg, if they want to have more specific restrictions in the military field, they can continue to maintain contact on the point of mutual defense after the implementation of the five-nation treaty.</p>
<h3>Zorin Appointed Soviet Ambassador to Czechoslovakia</h3>
<p>Czechoslovakia is Willing to Continue Trading with the West</p>
<p>[Associated Press London Seventh Dispatch] TASS announced today that the Soviet government has appointed Zorin as the Plenipotentiary Ambassador to Czechoslovakia.</p>
<p>[Reuters Prague Seventh Dispatch] Czech Foreign Trade Minister Gregor told foreign reporters that Czechoslovakia's foreign trade policy remains unchanged. The principle is still to import raw materials and export manufactured goods. The main target of exports is still Western countries. Although the goal of the five-year plan is to increase exports to the East to 45% of total exports. Gregor also stated that Czechoslovakia will continue to fulfill the trade agreements it has concluded with foreign countries, and hopes that other parties will do the same.</p>
<h3>People Fleeing from Northern Finland into Sweden</h3>
<p>[Associated Press Helsinki Sixth Dispatch] It was learned today that the Karelians in northern Finland were shocked to hear that the government would negotiate and conclude a treaty with the Soviet Union. They are now fleeing the country and entering Sweden. Border guards intercepted as many as thirty men, women, and children last night. The Karelians were formerly Soviet citizens. They moved to Finland around 1920, but because they have not applied for naturalization, they are deeply afraid that if Finland signs a new treaty, they will be handed over to the Soviet Union.</p>
<h3>French Prime Minister Schuman Wins Parliament's Confidence</h3>
<p>General Belief that the Political Climate is Extremely Bad</p>
<p>[Jiè Zhòng Society Paris Sixth Dispatch] After a lengthy meeting of the French National Assembly, Prime Minister Schuman finally won fifty votes of confidence. Faced with strong opposition from the Communist Party and de Gaulle, Schuman said that if the National Assembly could not support his forced public debt plan, he would submit his resignation. Observers believe that Schuman's intention is to ask the parliament to resign if it accepts any of the sixty-eight amendments passed on January 7. During the adjournment of the parliament, about fifty amendment clauses have been rejected. The parliament has never had such open hostility towards the Prime Minister's domestic policy. Schuman's vote of confidence is also considered dangerous. Most observers believe that Schuman's center-left Popular Republican Party coalition cabinet has gone through another crisis.</p>
<p>[Liên Jin Society Paris Sixth Dispatch] The French National Assembly voted several times today on Prime Minister Schuman's anti-inflation bill. Schuman's majority party support has weakened. Congressional observers do not believe that the cabinet crisis is imminent, but believe that the political climate is bad and accidents may occur. The Communists submitted an amendment today, which was rejected by 304 votes to 290. Schuman won by a margin of only fourteen votes. The Communist Party submitted a motion to fully promote the new economic bill, which was rejected by 301 votes to 288.</p>
<h3>Soviet Union's Policy Towards Eastern Europe Focuses on Plunder and Destroys European Reconstruction US House of Representatives Foreign Aid Committee Issues Report</h3>
<p>[Associated Press Washington Sixth Dispatch] According to the report of the House of Representatives Foreign Aid Committee, the Soviet Union is wholeheartedly constructing various businesses in its vassal states, so that they can be quickly refitted to produce military supplies. The report also lists the following points: (1) The United States' loan to Finland to purchase equipment to produce timber is actually tantamount to helping Finland pay reparations to the Soviet Union, and Finland can therefore export timber to pay the Soviet Union. (2) The Soviet Union's policies towards Finland, Hungary, and Romania are mainly based on plunder. (3) The Soviet Union is attempting to develop Soviet-style politics in Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, Poland, and Yugoslavia. (4) Soviet policy may be more political in the future and less focused on economics. (5) The Soviet Union is doing its best to crack down on opposition parties in Eastern Europe, so that they cannot effectively resist Sovietization policies, and even in countries such as the Czech Republic and Finland, where there is no opposition party, it is stepping up control. (6) Because of the "friendly" nature of the governments of its vassal states, it can charge high prices for the goods it exports and pay low prices for the goods it imports. The committee issued this report to prove how the situation in the Soviet Union's vassal states can affect the reconstruction plan of Western Europe. Small countries bear the obligation of large-scale trade with the Soviet Union, but their total exports are still far below pre-war levels. Even if the countries can restore their previous export volume, the goods shipped to Western Europe will definitely be less than before. Eastern Europe is afraid of hindering its economy and will inevitably want to retreat completely. Because of the tense relations with the United States, the Soviet Union may turn to Western Europe to purchase machinery.</p>
<h3>Churchill Warns of Approaching Third World War</h3>
<p>Soviet Union and Communist Party are Threatening the World</p>
<p>[United Press London Sixth Dispatch] British Conservative Party leader and wartime Prime Minister Churchill wrote to the party's parliamentary candidate Harris on the 6th, stating that every act of Soviet imperialism, communist violence, and conspiracy "is pushing the world step by step closer to a third world war." Churchill said that if Harris could win the Croton by-election, Europe and the United States would recognize this as "proof of the strength of Britain's moral purpose." Churchill also said: "Every man and woman, if they think about it, can see that we are all moving towards a terrifying situation at home and abroad. The recent developments may affect all of our party's domestic policies. Not only bankruptcy and poverty are approaching us in the British Isles, but every move of the Soviet Union also threatens the Third World War."</p>

<h3>The Three Powers Establish a West German Agreement Washington Expresses Gratification It is Expected that the Soviet Union Will Protest</h3>
<p>[Associated Press Washington Sixth Dispatch] London announced today the US-British-French agreement on the unified control of West Germany. Local diplomatic authorities expect the Soviet Union to protest fiercely, not only against its decision without the Soviet Union's involvement, but also to demand participation in the international control of the Ruhr area. The State Department seems quite pleased with the scope and rapid establishment of the London Agreement. Washington believes that this agreement has removed the last obstacle to France's decision to join the British and American merger zone in the occupied territory of West Germany.</p>
<h3>British Engineer Predicts Future Planetary Warfare Countries Will Compete for Lunar Bases Launching Rocket Bombs at Earth</h3>
<p>[Associated Press London Sixth Dispatch] The British Interplanetary Society's journal recently published a paper by member C.N. Clarke, imagining that future planetary wars will be more terrifying than atomic bombs. It is said that in the future, countries will compete for lunar bases. If such bases can manufacture fuel and other products, they can become the best bases for launching rocket bombs at the earth. Because the moon's gravity is smaller than the earth's, radiation is more convenient than on earth. In other words, anyone who first establishes a working base on the moon will be able to launch bigger and better bombs than any enemy on earth. Eventually, humans may take rockets to other planets to deal with enemies. Morally speaking, there is no difference between humans shooting arrows from a distance and killing each other with rockets from distant planets. Humans should find ways to prevent the realization of such planetary wars. A "transnational country" or a planetary exploration program jointly composed of large groups of countries such as the United States, the United Kingdom, and the Soviet Union may be realized within fifty years, unless humans are hopelessly ignorant and indefinitely delay it. Such an organization may gradually carry out the following plans: (1) Build high-altitude rocket detectors that double or triple the current altitude record, and transport personnel; (2) Build manned airships that circumnavigate the moon without landing; (3) Build airships to carry humans to the moon, land and fly back; (4) Build long-range planetary navigation airships, which can use the moon as a refueling station to fly to more distant planets. Before the planetary exploration plan is implemented, it is necessary to use atomic energy for rocket propulsion. Clarke is currently an engineer at De Havilland Engineering Works, formerly a technician at De Havilland Aircraft Factory, and a member of the British Aviation Association.</p>
<h3>After the Meeting of the Three Party Leaders Today, the New Japanese Cabinet Will Be Formed The Democratic Party is Distributing the Number of Cabinet Seats</h3>
<p>[Associated Press Tokyo Seventh Dispatch] Japanese Prime Minister-designate Hitoshi Ashida has decided to postpone the final plan for forming a cabinet until the afternoon of the 8th, when he will convene a second meeting with the leaders of the two friendly parties. However, it is believed that the new cabinet will take office on the 9th. Ashida visited outgoing Prime Minister Shigeru Yoshida on the 7th and asked him to join the cabinet, but Yoshida refused. Later, when the leaders of the three parties met, Ashida again asked Katayama to serve as a cabinet member, but Katayama also refused. Some observers say that Ashida is eager to invite Katayama to join the cabinet because Katayama has a good reputation outside the cabinet, and once the left-wing members of the Social Democratic Party oppose the new government, only Katayama can be expected to stop this offensive. Ashida said that he will raise the old matter again to Katayama at the meeting of the leaders of the three parties at the end of the cow on the 8th. It is rumored that Ashida hopes that Katayama will serve as the Minister of Foreign Affairs. It is generally believed that Katayama will not accept. If so, Ashida will give up Katayama and proceed to form a cabinet. The leaders of Ashida's Democratic Party have been discussing the distribution of cabinet seats all week. Once Ashida decides to proceed without Katayama, it can be completed immediately. It is rumored that KDP Chairman Miki Takeo asked the KDP to obtain the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry. The new government will not be much different from the previous Katayama cabinet. Both are a coalition government of the SDP, DP, and KDP. The difference is that there must be at least left-wing socialists in the new government to reward the left-wing for their assistance in the showdown vote in the House of Representatives on February 21. Observers generally speculate that the new government is likely to die young due to its inability to curb inflation and deal with other economic problems.</p>

<h3>Full Text of London Conference Communiqué: Ruhr Internationalization Allows German Participation in Control, Land and Security Issues to be Discussed at Next Conference</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 6th] Following the conclusion of the six-nation conference (Britain, United States, France, Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg) discussing the German problem, it was formally announced that an agreement had been reached on the policy of international control of the Ruhr area. It is generally agreed that this represents the most significant new progress in Western countries' handling of the German problem. However, its success or failure will depend on subsequent conferences of Western nations, including the five-nation Western European Union conference in Brussels and the sixteen-nation European conference in Paris. The policies agreed upon at the London Conference will be submitted to the governments of the six participating countries for approval. The official communiqué only stated that the recommendations concern the form and scope of the international control regime in the Ruhr, and that Germany may also participate in the control mechanism. Further details have not yet been revealed.</p>
<p>The communiqué issued after the conclusion of the London Conference also stated that the participating countries unanimously recognized the need for close economic relations between western Germany and Western Europe. It further stated that the French and Anglo-American zones in Germany should have appropriate representation in the permanent body handling European aid under the Marshall Plan. It also stated that land and security issues would be left for discussion at the next conference. Although the communiqué did not announce the merger of the French zone with the Anglo-American zone, it stated that "the representatives of the United States, Britain, and France have agreed to recommend to their respective governments that they engage in close cooperation on economic policies relating to foreign trade, transportation, and tariffs in the three zones, to the greatest extent possible."</p>
<p>Door Still Open to the Soviets</p>
<p>The full text of the communiqué, after detailing the delegations that participated in the various meetings since the London Conference began on February 23, further stated: "The conference has made significant progress and has decided that this discussion should continue in April to resolve the remaining issues, so that each participating delegation can submit to its respective government recommendations on the entire West German question, as agreed upon at the next conference. At the same time, the nature of some issues still requires more detailed review. The fact that the continuation of the Four Power Foreign Ministers Conference has not led to a Four Power agreement has created a situation in Germany which, if allowed to continue, will have unfortunate consequences for Western Europe. Therefore, the political and economic emergency problems arising from this situation must be resolved. The countries participating in this London Conference are deeply aware of the need to ensure the economic recovery of Western Europe (including Germany) and to establish a foundation for democratic Germany to participate in the group of free nations. Although the completion of this goal cannot be delayed any longer, the possibility of ultimately reaching a Four Power agreement has not been ruled out. All items on the agenda for this conference, except for security issues, have been studied in detail. Security issues have also been preliminarily reviewed and will be further studied in detail when the next conference resumes. The land issue will also be left for discussion at the next conference.</p>
<p>Ensuring Cooperation Among the Three Powers</p>
<p>"The representatives of the United States, France, and Britain discussed the parts of the German reparations problem related to the internal policies of the three occupation zones, and West Germany's relationship to the European Recovery Program. It was confirmed that for the political and economic welfare of Western European countries and democratic Germany, there should be close ties between the economic lives of Western European countries and democratic Germany. Furthermore, since the economic unification of Germany as a whole and East Germany's participation in the European Recovery Program have proven impossible, the United States, Britain, and France have agreed to maintain close cooperation among the three countries and in the three occupation zones of West Germany on issues related to the European Recovery Program. This cooperation is essential to enable West Germany to make a full contribution to the recovery of Europe. The representatives of the United States, Britain, and France also agreed that the Anglo-American zone and the French zone of West Germany should fully participate in the European Recovery Program and have appropriate representation in any permanent organization of the program. The representatives of the three countries will submit these recommendations to their respective governments and to the next meeting of the Committee of European Economic Cooperation.</p>
<p>Utilizing Ruhr Resources</p>
<p>"Regarding the participation of the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg in policies towards Germany, an agreement in principle has been reached. The delegations have also considered the establishment of an international control regime for the Ruhr, in which Germany may also participate. The purpose of this international control regime is to ensure that the economic resources of the Ruhr are no longer used for aggression, and to enable a large part of Europe, including Germany, to benefit from the Ruhr's coal, steel, and coke production. Recommendations on the form and scope of authority of the international control regime will be submitted by the delegations of the participating countries to their respective governments.</p>
<p>Unifying German Politics and Economics</p>
<p>"The participating delegations also held concrete discussions on the current situation in Germany and the possible evolution of political and economic institutions in the Anglo-American and French zones of West Germany. Broad agreement was reached on a number of complex points. Of particular importance is that the participating delegations have agreed to confirm that a federal form of government, with appropriate central authority while providing appropriate protection for the rights of the states, is the most appropriate way to build German unity under the current circumstances.</p>
<p>"In order to facilitate West Germany's cooperation with the European Recovery Program, the United States, Britain, and France have agreed to take prompt action to coordinate, to the greatest extent possible, the economic policies of the three occupation zones of the United States, Britain, and France regarding foreign trade, transportation, and tariffs."</p>
<p>The leader of the British delegation was Mr. Strang, head of the German Department of the Foreign Office. The leader of the American delegation was Mr. Douglas, the American Ambassador to London. The leader of the French delegation was Mr. Massigli, the Ambassador to London.</p>

<h3>Sino-American Cooperation to Explore Mount 積石: 雷諾 Leads Team, Special Plane Arrives in Shanghai, Flies to Beijing This Morning to Meet with Chinese Experts and Others for Departure</h3>
<p>Full View of 雷諾 Expedition Plane (Photo by This Newspaper)</p>
<p>[Report from This Newspaper] The 雷諾 Mount 積石 Expedition Team of seven people arrived in this city's 龍華 Airport yesterday afternoon at 3:20 PM on a special plane, the "Explorer". As the door opened, Mr. 雷諾 appeared first. He was wearing a light yellow camel hair coat, a dark brown felt hat, and looked energetic and smiled warmly, shaking hands and exchanging pleasantries with the welcomers.</p>
<p>According to 雷諾: the team took off from Chicago on February 29th and made several stops along the way to check the machinery and replenish supplies. The flight was very smooth all the way. However, the plane stopped overnight on Wake Island, where a fuel tank leak was discovered. Fortunately, it was on the ground and was repaired. The team took off from Guam at around 4:00 AM yesterday morning (Shanghai time) and flew directly to Shanghai without stopping along the way. The team flew continuously for nearly twelve hours before arriving safely in Shanghai. The team does not intend to stay in Shanghai for long. It is scheduled to fly directly to Nanjing at 9:30 AM on the 8th to meet with Chinese experts in Beijing, take the plane together to 闌, and begin its exploration and surveying work on Mount 積石. Afterwards, Lanzhou will be its work base. Once the mission is accomplished, the team will return to Beijing, Shanghai, and other places to participate in social events with various circles.</p>
<p>Mr. 雷諾's "Explorer" special plane is a C-87 four-engine military transport aircraft. The plane is silver. The name "Explorer" is written in blue paint on the nose, followed by "雷諾's Boston Museum China Expedition", "Pilot Orton", "Aviation Engineer Sally" and other words. On the small wings on both sides of the tail, the crossed flags of China and the United States are painted. Inside the cabin, in addition to three small rooms with seats, the rest of the space is occupied by scientific instruments and luggage for surveying and mapping, weighing as much as 30 tons.</p>
<p>The complete list of members of the 雷諾 Expedition Team was officially announced yesterday. It included nine American members: 雷諾, the team leader; scientific advisor 華士本 (Director of the Boston Museum, Mr. 華 has already come to Shanghai); pilot Orton; engineer Sally; historical expert 賴威 (also the director of the team's affairs, Mr. 賴 is the vice president of the 雷諾 pen company); geologist Dr. 葛四維 (Ohio State University); scientific instrument expert 麥 (Department of Aeronautics Engineering, Massachusetts Institute of Technology); photography expert Ross (Optical Laboratory, Boston University); and liaison officer Yang Dize (Major Secretary of the US Army, who has already arrived in Shanghai).</p>
<p>There are a total of ten Chinese members: scientific advisor Zhang Geng (Professor, Central University); geologist Dr. Cheng Yuqi (Central Geological Survey); geographer Dr. Luo Kaifu (Geographical Research Institute of the Sino-British Cultural Foundation); geographer Professor Xu Jinzhi (Professor of Geography, Central University); geologist Sun Dianqing (Academia Sinica); Lai Xunyan (Representative of the Civil Aviation Administration); Major Rao Huihua (Military Liaison Director); Captain Hu Rongsheng; Lieutenant Li Lie; Lieutenant Zhu Chao (all of the above are military liaison officers).</p>
<p>Those who went to the airport to welcome Mr. 雷諾 yesterday included Zhang, the representative of Mayor Wu; Wang Xiaolai, the chairman of the National Federation of Commercial Associations; and others. Also returning to China on Mr. 雷諾's "Explorer" special plane were Gu Weijun's second son, Gu Yuchang, and Wang Xiaolai's eldest daughter, Gong Qian Gu Wang Lianqing.

<h3>National Federation of Industries: Important Resolutions: Urging the Government to Increase Coal Allocation, Reduce Prices of Reparation Machines, Considering Special Levies on Factories as Obstructing Production</h3>
<p>[Report from This Newspaper] The National Federation of Industries held a meeting of directors and supervisors yesterday morning. More than twenty people attended, including Wu Yun Chu, Pan Yang Shan, Tao Gui Lin, Yin Zhi Zhong, Shen Si Fang, Rong Hong Yuan, Zhuang Zhi Huan, Hu Bo Xiang, Tian He Qing, Chu Feng Zhang, and Lin Ji Yong. It was chaired by Wu Yun Chu. In addition to reporting on recent federation affairs, the meeting discussed various important proposals and resolved the following important issues: (1) Promoting the establishment of industrial associations in various regions. (2) Coal allocated for electricity business operations is insufficient, and it is necessary to purchase supplementary coal on the black market, which increases the cost burden of industrial production. At the same time, power outages often occur due to insufficient coal, causing production to stop. The government is requested to increase coal allocation to ensure the necessary power for increased production. (3) Recently, the Ministry of Economic Affairs announced that the prices of Japanese reparations machines are extremely high, even exceeding the prices of ordering from Europe and the United States. Moreover, the application deadline is set for March 15th. The government should be requested to reduce the prices and extend the application deadline. At the same time, the machines must be unboxed first to allow factories applying to purchase them to inspect samples. (4) Regarding the government's regulation that profit tax is levied at six times the amount from last year, since the situation varies in each industry, it is impossible to make a rigid regulation. It should be reasonably assessed and paid by impartial members of the local industrial and commercial community. (5) It is reasonable for the government to announce a special levy for relief for both individuals and legal entities and to levy on wealthy households. However, it seems that levying on factory units obstructs production and should be exempted. (6) All quota allocations of raw materials for the fifth and sixth seasons should be entrusted to the industrial community for self-allocation so that raw materials are not lacking and to avoid exploitation by middlemen and reduce production costs. In addition to submitting these important resolutions to the competent authorities for adoption, Wu Yun Chu, Pan Yang Shan, Tao Gui Lin, Zhuang Zhi Huan, Yin Zhi Zhong, Shen Si Fang, and Li Cunting were appointed to go to Beijing to present their views to various agencies.</p>
<h3>Representatives of the Rubber Industry in 平津: Urging Increased Import Quotas</h3>
<p>[Report from This Newspaper] The Rubber Industry Association of the Second District of Tianjin and the Rubber Industry Association of Peiping, in order to appeal for an increase in the import quota for raw rubber based on the actual needs of the factories in the two cities, and to allocate quotas for chemical raw materials, have specially dispatched three representatives. The Tianjin representatives are Pang Yongxuan (Manager of 振堂 Rubber Factory), Chairman of the Rubber Industry Association of the Second District of Tianjin, and Qiao Mingxun (Manager of 震 Rubber Factory). The Peiping representative is Tang Shaoyao (General Manager of 新華 Rubber Factory). They took a plane to Shanghai on the 6th and will visit the Export Management Committee authorities within days. According to the representatives, there are a total of 65 public and private rubber factories in Peiping and Tianjin. However, the quota allocated to the association in the past was US$120,000 in the second quarter, US$80,000 in the third quarter, and has been reduced to US$59,500 in the fourth quarter. With this amount of foreign exchange to order and import raw rubber, only over 160 tons, which is a very small amount when distributed to each factory. The foreign exchange quota in North China is generally insufficient, especially for rubber. If this continues, the rubber factories in Peiping and Tianjin will have to shut down. Furthermore, the rubber industry is a complex chemical industry with a large variety of required chemical raw materials. For those stipulated in the second category of quota items, the industry has not yet received a quota. They are coming to Shanghai this time to appeal for quota allocation as well.</p>
<h3>Representatives of 7 Cotton Merchants from 鄂: Requesting Loans to Purchase Cotton</h3>
<p>The Hubei cotton merchant petition group, previously because the National Cotton Yarn Cloth Management Committee统購 cotton, entrusted China Textile Company to purchase on its behalf, and signed a contract with Shanghai cotton merchants to lend money to purchase, has repeatedly petitioned the committee, requesting to entrust the commission to purchase loans as an example, but has not received a concrete reply. Therefore, seven representatives, including Cheng Ziju, Li Jianting, and Wang Aqiong, were sent to Shanghai and went directly to the committee at 10:00 AM yesterday to discuss the principles with Deputy Director Zhu Suwu, and then presented the group's wishes to Chairman Yuan. They will also go to Beijing in the near future to petition the Executive Yuan and the Ministry of Economic Affairs.</p>
<h3>Smuggling of Rice and Grain in Wuxi: The Municipal Government Sends a Telegram Requesting a Ban</h3>
<p>Recently, rice prices in this city have risen sharply again. It is reported that a large number of 崇沙帮 people are searching for purchases in Wuxi, and there is talk of smuggling to the north, which has raised rice prices in the producing areas. After receiving the report, the city government of this city has telegraphed the Executive Yuan to order the Jiangsu Provincial Government to order the troops stationed at various ports to strictly ban the smuggling of rice and grain in order to suppress rice prices in the producing areas.</p>
<h3>Jade and Jewelry Industry Mistakenly Buys Stolen Goods: Requesting Correction of Handling Methods</h3>
<p>The Jade and Jewelry Industry Association of this city, because its members often mistakenly receive stolen goods when buying various ornaments, has been deeply affected. The association recently sent representatives Cheng Fuxiang, Secretary-General Gu Yaotang, to the council to petition, expressing the hardships of the merchants, and requesting the correction of the handling methods. The original petition stated: "The crime of receiving stolen goods under the criminal law is established only if the recipient knowingly receives the goods. When merchants and the public buy goods, it is a legitimate act in the course of business. If they did not know beforehand that the goods were stolen, it is obviously not intentional, and there is no criminal liability under the law. If a mistake is made in buying stolen goods, it is obviously not intentional receipt, which is very clear. If the loser wants to recover the original item, they should reimburse the purchase price and prepare the funds. Moreover, jewelry and ornaments are mostly of considerable value, and good merchants seek profit from capital. It is difficult to bear unexpected losses. Therefore, when the police station extracts stolen goods, in addition to the shop owner being guaranteed by the association to be available at any time, a formal receipt should be issued so that the goods or price can be redeemed," and so on.</p>

<h3>Public Servants Suffering: The Municipal Government Appeals to the Central Government on Their Behalf: Requesting Restoration of Eight Dou of Rice Allocation</h3>
<p>Regarding the problem of improving the treatment of public servants, Secretary-General Shen of the municipal government stated yesterday that in light of the current high prices, the municipal government has reported the difficulties of public servants to the central government. However, improving treatment is a national issue, and the central government is unable to raise it specially for Shanghai alone. Although the central government made adjustments to treatment from January of this year, calculated according to a public servant index of 85,000 times, the allocation of food rice has been reduced by five dou. The average increase per adjustment is only over 1 million yuan, and the reduction of five dou of food rice also reduces income by over 1 million yuan. In that case, the so-called adjustment is of no benefit. On the contrary, prices are rising step by step, and it is difficult for public servants to maintain their livelihoods. Therefore, the municipal government has now requested the central government to restore the food rice allocation to eight dou. In addition, the municipal government also plans to conduct various welfare facilities for employees, such as issuing medical expenses for employees who are ill.</p>
<p>The Municipal Treasury Is Not Well-Funded: Difficult to Allocate Funds for Subsidies First</p>
<p>When the reporter further inquired whether the municipal government could provide subsidies before the central government made reasonable adjustments to the treatment of public servants, Mr. Shen stated that the municipal treasury is not well-funded and the revenue and expenditure are still difficult to balance. It is impossible to allocate additional funds for subsidies, and it is also difficult for the audit office to approve the receipt of funds because it is not included in the budget.</p>
<h3>Winter Relief Donations: Over 30 Billion Collected</h3>
<p>Deadline for Payment of Dance Hall Charity Dance Donations</p>
<p>As the Winter Relief Society is about to end, the Fundraising Committee of the society announced yesterday that as of yesterday, the society had raised winter relief donations totaling 30,379,871,806 yuan. Among the various donations, the film charity screenings will not end until April, so there will be ongoing donation income. The charity dance fundraising has long passed its deadline, but there are still several major dances that have not yet paid the donations to the collecting bank. The society is urging them to pay again, and the list is as follows: (1) MGM Dance Hall: unpaid donation of 129,400,050 yuan. (2) Metropolitan Dance Hall: unpaid donation of 45,082,500 yuan. (3) New Metropolitan Dance Hall: unpaid donation of 5,948,000 yuan. (4) Central Dance Hall: unpaid donation of 36,935,000 yuan. (5) In the charity sale project of Paramount, one dancer charity-sold a ring with an auction price of 6 million yuan. Has not been paid in. The association limits the payment of the above six donations to within this week, otherwise it will be transferred to the Social Affairs Bureau and the court for handling. As for the donations solicited by other sectors, the association also hopes to send them to the collecting bank as soon as possible in order to handle relief work in a timely manner. The donations from the issuance of house charity sale tickets are not included.</p>

<h3>Former Manager of the Cotton Cloth Bank: Suspected of Embezzling Enemy Assets</h3>
<p>Ministry of Finance Sends Letter to District Prosecutor's Office for Investigation</p>
<p>[Report from This Newspaper] The Ministry of Finance recently sent a letter to the District Prosecutor's Office of this city, requesting an investigation into Ding Erxun, the former manager of the Cotton Cloth Bank of this city, on suspicion of forging documents and embezzling enemy assets. The reason is that an enemy merchant, Wan Zhaoyang Firm, had sent a large number of flour soap items to the Cotton Cloth Bank for mortgage. After the victory, Ding actually attempted to embezzle them, falsely claiming that a forged 100 million yuan Central Reserve Note check was issued to Wan Zhaoyang Firm on July 31, 1945, so the assets had actually been purchased. When the relevant authorities investigated, Ding forged the official documents of the Liquidation Office of the Puppet Central Reserve Bank to prove that this was indeed the case. However, when the relevant authorities further investigated with the Liquidation Office of the Puppet Central Reserve Bank, they learned that they were all forged. The Ministry of Finance, based on the report, sent a letter to the District Prosecutor's Office for investigation.</p>

<h3>Two Women Attempt Suicide on Eve of Women's Day</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Chen Suying, a 21-year-old prostitute from Suzhou working at Li Yunxia Brothel in No. 13 Huile Lane, Fuzhou Road, suddenly had suicidal thoughts around 1 AM this morning. She cut off her gold bracelet and secretly swallowed it to commit suicide. It is understood that a customer named Zhou frequently visited the brothel and tried to invite Chen out on dates, but Chen refused. Last night around 9 PM, Zhou came again and was rejected. Enraged, he scolded Chen severely. After being dissuaded by others, he left reluctantly. Chen was humiliated by this insult and cried on her pillow. The next morning, taking advantage of a moment when no one was watching, she swallowed the gold to die. Fortunately, people in the brothel discovered her and urgently reported it to the Laozha Police Station, who sent officers to investigate the truth. She was hired a car and taken to Renji Hospital for treatment, and she was saved.</p>

<h3>UNRRA Fishing Vessels Entering and Leaving Ports Must Be Inspected and Measured According to Law</h3>
<p>The 160 UNRRA fishing vessels owned by the Fisheries Administration have never followed the law when entering and leaving ports by completing procedures with the Navigation Bureau and the Customs.

It is now learned that the Navigation Bureau has received instructions from the Ministry of Communications, stating: All fishing vessels owned by the Fisheries Administration shall apply to the competent Navigation Bureau for inspection and measurement in accordance with the regulations, and must have inspection certificates. In addition to sending a letter to the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration to inform them of the regulations and comply with them, it is hereby notified that all fishing vessels without the various certificates shall not be allowed to sail to ensure safety. It is reported that both the fishing and shipping industries are paying close attention to this matter and hope that the authorities will strictly enforce it.</p>
<h3>Employees of Four Banks and Two Bureaus Demand Salary Adjustment; Collective Sit-In Possible Today if No Satisfactory Resolution Is Reached</h3>
<p>Employees of the city's four banks and two bureaus are demanding salary adjustments. If the bank and bureau authorities do not provide a reasonable response today, action may be taken. All employees of the banks and bureaus jointly signed a letter on the 1st of this month, making three demands: (1) After the salaries of the banks and bureaus' employees are calculated according to the treatment of public education personnel, the base salary should be adjusted to the standard of civil servants. (2) After the unreasonable cancellation of the public education differential subsidy, the banks and bureaus should issue one dan of rice to compensate for the insufficient living expenses of employees. (3) The income of workers is low, and the bank and bureau should subsidize the education expenses of their children. It is reported that the bank and bureau authorities have accepted and are considering the third item regarding subsidizing the education expenses of workers' children, but the first and second items have not yet been decided. According to sources within the banks and bureaus: If the bank and bureau authorities do not provide a satisfactory resolution today, all employees of the four banks and two bureaus and their branches will hold a sit-in in their offices after work until dawn. Furthermore, according to a newsletter issued by the employees of the banks and bureaus, the employees' actions are based on the following reasons: (1) The base salaries of the bank and bureau employees have always been low, and after being changed to be calculated according to the public education index, it has not increased, but rather decreased. (2) The differential subsidy for public education personnel has been canceled for no reason. In addition to printing and distributing "Our Accusations," employees have sent an open letter to the Director of Personnel of the Central Bank, stating four points of view.</p>
<h3>Two-landlord Era Darlings Emerge from Housing Shortage; One Street-crossing Room Demands 80 Million; Real Estate Brokers Spring Up Like Bamboo Shoots After Rain</h3>
<p>[Special Report from Our Newspaper] The severity of Shanghai's current housing shortage has reached its peak. After the announcement of the charity housing lottery results, the envy, joy, and disappointment expressed in the minds of the vast majority of citizens were even more profound than the anticipation of the huge sums of money from the aviation lottery ten years ago. The excessive concentration of the urban population has turned originally spacious and clean alleys into snack streets, and the originally quiet and dust-free roadsides have added many grass sheds to provide shelter from the wind and rain; courtyards have been converted into front buildings, attics have been added on top of front buildings, and side rooms have been divided into three; cooking causes smoke to fill the air, lingering all day long, and the cries of children can be heard by several households. In this environment where even air and sunlight have become scarce treasures, the continuous occurrence of theft, epidemics, adultery, and fires is certainly beyond human prevention.</p>
<p>Speaking is as firm as a mountain, with no compromise</p>
<p>Because vacant land is as valuable as gold, people who own real estate have become the darlings of the times. Although their authority over renting and transferring has largely fallen into the hands of two-landlords, their value is increasing daily with the rise in prices. As for the title of two-landlord, it now looks down upon all other occupations. Other occupations can ask for the sky-high price and be bargained to the ground, but the two-landlord speaks as firmly as a mountain, with no compromise. If you look at a house in the morning, the two-landlord will ask for two gold bars, and you must first pay a deposit of 20%. If you hesitate, and go back in the evening, either the house has already been transferred, or the price has increased by another 10%. A civil servant recently went to see a house that only had one room above the street, and the two-landlord asked for 80 million. The civil servant said he would discuss it with his wife and decide. He went back to the same place that night, and the two-landlord was in the middle of a heated mahjong game. Before the civil servant could speak, the two-landlord waved his hands and said, "Not renting it!" The civil servant then claimed that he was willing to accept the price, but the two-landlord lowered his face and said, "I won't rent it even if you offer 80 million!" Then he began to lecture him: "You're so indecisive, annoying!"</p>
<p>One side room, divided into three</p>
<p>The power of the two-landlords has quickly infected people who have spare rooms. During the Lunar New Year, many middle and upper-class families visited each other, and after congratulating each other, they would say: "You'll be a two-landlord this year!" Complimenting someone as a two-landlord has become a flattering remark, so how could the two-landlords not rise like wind and clouds? Not to mention those with many spare rooms, even families with only one side room hire workers to divide it into three, calling it the front room, middle room, and back room. They live in the front room themselves, and rent out the middle and back rooms. If each room doesn't have good facilities, it can still be rented for 100 million per room at the current price, and 200 million can be made instantly. While the two-tenant becomes a two-landlord and makes a large profit, it is pitiful for the small tenant who has exhausted all efforts just to have a place to live. Beforehand, they scrounge and scrape together money, burdened with debt. Afterwards, they live in a tiny room, gradually wearing away and crushing their lives in the darkness, dampness, and noise.</p>
<p>Panic buying, Many Transactions</p>
<p>Some say that Shanghai's housing shortage is serious, but it is real and unreal at the same time, because apart from the unreachable likes of Kiessling &amp; Bader, the Racecourse, and the Foreign Cemetery, there are still countless "magnificent buildings" with deeply locked doors and no signs of life. Others believe that on an ordinary street, there is bound to be at least one vacant house within ten steps. How can this be seen? They say that the rental classified ads in the newspapers, which are updated daily, and the transaction records of nearly a thousand real estate brokers throughout the city, can all serve as the most detailed proof.</p>
<p>Negotiating, Charging According to the Person</p>
<p>Speaking of real estate brokers, this is another one of the most profitable occupations that has emerged in recent years. At the time of the victory, the scope of activities of these people was limited to "Spring Breeze Triumphant Building," because of concerns about prohibitions, the number of people engaged in the industry was limited. But today, following the flow of hot money or carrying the fate of being persecuted, people from northern Jiangsu, northern China, and Sichuan, Yunnan, and southern China have flocked to Shanghai, the urgency of finding a house may even be greater than finding a job. But in a strange land, the relationship between housing supply and demand may not be smooth, so they happily appeared in the middle of this; negotiating, charging according to the person. Although it is stated that they only take a 10% commission, transactions come in droves, a large sum every three days, a small sum every two days, and after months of operation, the foundation is established.</p>
<h3>Living Labels, Replacing Advertisements</h3>
<p>Because business is booming, most of the brokers from the "Spring Breeze Triumphant Building" era have opened specialized companies, becoming the leaders in the industry. Where there is profit, who is willing to fall behind – real estate brokers have sprung up like bamboo shoots after the rain in the past six months, attracting customers in groups; some have changed careers from doctors and grain merchants, while others are operating as old goods stores and cigarette paper shops. In addition to setting up institutions to direct and coordinate, they also send mobile personnel to solicit and negotiate, wearing a cap and dressed in short clothing, like "yellow cattle" selling black market tickets in front of a theater. These living labels have replaced the red rental advertisements that were all over the streets and alleys a few years ago.</p>

<h3>Heinous Bloodbath Discovered in Kunming: Wife Kills Husband, Son Murders Father, Brother Kills Sister; Murderer Cao Xincheng on the Run; Great Tragedy of Property Seizure Discovered From Two Girls' Corpses</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Kunming, 7th] On February 27th, two girls' bodies were discovered in the eastern suburbs of Kunming, having been hacked to death. Their clothes resembled those of primary school students, and they appeared to be sisters. A blunt axe and miscellaneous items such as pens and inks were left next to the bodies. A badge with the words "Wenzhong" was found on one of the bodies. The incident caused a city-wide sensation, but no one came to claim them. After ten days of investigation by the City Police Department, the case has been solved. It turns out to be a heinous family bloodbath of "wife killing husband, son murdering father, brother killing sister." The two girls' father and stepmother were also murdered. The police cracked the case based on the "Wenzhong" badge. They found out that there was a Wenzhong Elementary School in Baoshan County and sent officers to investigate. It was confirmed to be the school badge, and it was identified by the daughter of Wang Zhengnong, a resident in the city. Wang was from Baoshan and had considerable wealth. He had a wife and a concubine. The wife, Ms. Li, was in her forties and had a son named Xirong, who did not pursue a proper career. The concubine, Ms. Ji, had two daughters named Xilu and Xihou, who were the ones murdered in the Kunming suburbs. When the detectives arrived at Wang's house, they discovered that Wang Zhengnong had disappeared. Only Wang's wife, Ms. Li, was at home. She spoke evasively. After being detained and interrogated, she confessed that there was discord between the wife and concubine in the family. Li and her son Xirong plotted to seize the family property. They colluded with Cao Xincheng, Wang's sister's husband, who had served as the Chief of the Materials Section of the Ordnance Maintenance Training Class of the Ministry of Military Affairs. They first hacked Wang Zhengnong and Ms. Ji to death in mid-February and buried the bodies in Cao's garden. On February 20th, Cao took the two daughters to Kunming and killed them to carry out the conspiracy to divide the family property. Cao is on the run, and Cao's wife, Ms. Wang, has also been detained.</p>
<h3>Travelogue of Shanxi (3): Overcoming Disaster and Reducing Food Consumption</h3>
<p>Twelve years ago, Shanxi began to sing the "Anti-Communist Song" written by Yan Xishan himself: "The Communist Party deceives people in three stages, sweet first, then bitter, don't be deceived. The first stage is buying you over, giving you small favors, distributing grain and land to make you happy. The second stage is forced, your wealth is not up to you, men become Red Guards, women become comfort women, parents, wives, and children are permanently separated. The third stage is shocking and bloody, if you don't do as they say, you will be killed without a doubt, either to fill the cannon eyes or to be hacked to death with knives, the communists in Jiangxi and Shaanxi kill people like ants. The communist bandits used the money of people, the land of landlords, and the lives of poor people as capital to rob the regime today, launching a ruthless and unparalleled full-scale rebellion, causing famine!" During the nationwide price surge in May last year, Taiyuan proposed a method that did not involve any profound economic principles in response to the reality – "People's Economy." It aimed to simplify life, protect life, allocate work, and distribute property to overcome the difficulties of the communist bandits.</p>
<p>Simplifying Life</p>
<p>Simplifying life seeks "equality" and "stability." Apart from soldiers who can eat half millet and half wheat for their top-grade meals, everyone else, regardless of official, civilian, rich, or poor, eats second-grade meals – wheat for two days, refined grains (including millet, bean noodles, buckwheat, etc.) for eight days, and coarse grains (including corn, sorghum, barley, etc.) for twenty days. Each person is allowed half a pound of salt per month, and those with small appetites get half that. Each person is allowed to buy no more than flower cloth worth four yuan in the old currency per year. The so-called old currency is also a new term, but it is not a currency. It is just a conceptual conversion standard based on comparing the price of a bolt of No. 3 cloth during the Anti-Japanese War with the price of a bolt of No. 3 cloth now to find an index, and using this index as a measure for exchanging agricultural products. Restaurants are also graded. The three "banquet" restaurants are specially for receiving foreign guests and are allowed to sell high-end food. The seven "social" restaurants are for weddings and funerals, and the rest are all people's canteens.</p>
<p>Protecting Life</p>
<p>The agency that implements the People's Economy policy is the "People's Economy Implementation Committee." In "protecting life," it stipulates that the income of farmers, workers, and merchants must be equal. At the same time, it registers the unemployed and is responsible for allocating work. As for "distributing property," the scope is very broad. It executes the exchange of industrial products and agricultural products within the province, as well as the exchange of raw materials and daily necessities from other provinces for the province's products. However, in the former case, the Three-Self Patriotic Movement strictly distinguishes between the country and the country's enemies, and the distribution of materials is also clear. Absorbing food from the bandit areas is out of the question. As for the government-controlled areas, they have reached the end of their rope. In the latter case, Chennault's air transport team is the only means of transportation, but the freight cost of hundreds of millions of old currency per ton is truly unbearable.</p>
<p>The shops in Taiyuan are all crying out in pain. Under the strict control of unified procurement, they can no longer play their wishful thinking. Many stores are still piled with countless foreign wines and canned goods, but who can afford such high prices. Although there are free markets, they are limited to food and daily necessities.</p>
<p>Spring Couplets in the City</p>
<p>The People's Economy Implementation Committee is run by 18 members elected from all walks of life, including farmers, workers, merchants, self-defense forces, and women. However, there are also neighborhood meetings, which are held weekly. Only matters passed in the neighborhood meetings can be implemented. This method allows the spirit of democracy to be developed to a high degree. However, when I was at Jinci, I saw a limerick on the wall: "The sky is level, but the ground is not level, the water is level, but the mountain is not level, people are equal, but the heart is not equal, nine out of ten people are not equal." I heard that there is also this spring couplet in Taiyuan: "People celebrate the New Year with two ups and eight downs (describing the hand gestures of making dumplings), we welcome spring with nine outs and one in (describing the hand gestures of making corn buns)," and the horizontal scroll is "People's Economy." In this day and age, I am afraid that nothing is harder to achieve than "equality."</p>
<p>The Shanxi authorities recognize that the "People's Economy" has been generally effective in the past eight months, but now General Yan sighs: "Today, the problem of food in Shanxi is not a question of price, but of whether there is any at all. We have now moved from the distribution stage of the People's Economy to the famine relief stage."</p>
<p>Famine Relief</p>
<p>The reason for the severe food shortage in Jinzhong is the severe drought last spring and summer, with a harvest of only 30% to 40% of a normal year. On the other hand, the refugees after the communist bandits' "settling old accounts" and the old and weak women and children "driven" into Shanxi have added a burden of more than 600,000 people to the isolated island of Jinzhong. It is estimated that at least half of the counties in Jinzhong will be short of food for three months this spring. In order to overcome the disaster and reduce food consumption, General Yan issued a painful "Letter to the People of Jinzhong": "We only have two ways to reduce food consumption ourselves and hope for central relief, and aircraft to transport food. But asking the government to transport by plane is also a difficult matter and cannot be hoped for too extravagantly. Today, we focus on the people's food conservation." "I am temporarily planning to divide the food for at least four people into five people's meals, which means dividing the food for one person for four days into five days." "It is easy to divide food today, but it will be difficult to run out of food in the future."</p>
<p>Loans to Purchase Food</p>
<p>The prices in Taiyuan are so high: 7 million yuan for a dan of wheat, 40,000 yuan for a jin of sorghum, and 3.5 million yuan for a bag of flour. Will the tragic scene of people starving to death next to piles of silver treasures in Guangxu three years occur again in Shanxi? Otherwise, the reporter would not have heard this appeal: "Please allow the people of Taiyuan and other cities to mortgage all their property, houses, factories, etc., to borrow loans at home and abroad to purchase and transport food to relieve the famine!" (Our reporter Yang Wenyu)</p>

<p>Ruthless Rails</p>
<p>A couple takes their own lives</p>
<p>The baby in the womb dies simultaneously</p>
<p>[Report from our Tianjin correspondent on the 3rd] At noon on the 3rd, a tragic incident occurred between the Beining Railway's main station and the east station, where a young couple committed suicide by lying on the tracks. This is exactly one month after Huang Wenxiang and Ma Fenghua committed suicide by lying on the tracks due to marital discord. The protagonists of this new tragedy are the man, named An Yusheng, 25 years old, from Tianjin, and the woman, his wife, Mrs. An Yang, 28 years old. Mrs. Yang was pregnant with a fetus of about four or five months. The young couple and the unborn baby died together under the ruthless iron wheels. As for the cause of the suicide, the authorities are investigating.</p>
<p>It is said that the people and the land are in harmony; the future achievements can certainly be imagined.</p>
<p>Various Measures</p>
<p>Implemented One After Another</p>
<p>In addition to personnel decisions, various measures related to the entire suppression plan have also been implemented one after another. The main ones are roughly these: (1) Increasing the number of security police groups by five; (2) Improving the salaries of the original ten security police groups and the security police teams in various counties; (3) Organizing and training local civilian armed forces to strictly carry out the work of clearing the countryside; (4) Incorporating stray and miscellaneous troops; (5) Strengthening transportation facilities, including emergency telephone lines in relevant counties. As for the implementation of the suppression, the principle is "30% military, 70% political," implementing both pacification and suppression. For bandits who surrender and reform, proper arrangements will be made, either by assigning them tasks of suppressing bandits, enabling them to participate in production work, or sending them back to their hometowns to resume their original occupations. In short, the procedures for amnesty are simplified, and the conditions for self-renewal are lenient. As long as they sincerely return, they will not be held accountable for past offenses.</p>
<p>In late January this year, the Guangdong Provincial Police and Security Department convened another reorganization meeting, attended by commanders from various districts and the chiefs of the police and security corps. This meeting made important decisions regarding the finances, equipment, and supplies of the troops in various districts throughout the province.</p>
<p>Within Three Months</p>
<p>Eliminating Bandit Atmosphere</p>
<p>After all the deployments were properly arranged, the authorities launched a spring anti-bandit campaign, preparing to concentrate military force to encircle and annihilate the main bandit forces in various districts within three months, and then use civilian armed forces to clear the countryside and defend themselves, so as to thoroughly eliminate the bandit atmosphere. Although this plan was launched in late February, since the establishment of the anti-bandit command headquarters in various districts, many local bandits have been defeated, and under the combination of pacification and suppression, there have been even more people carrying weapons to surrender and reform. According to the results of the anti-bandit campaign in the province from January to February 15, announced by the headquarters, a total of 2,140 bandits were killed, 1,558 bandits were captured, and 1,368 bandits surrendered and reformed, totaling 5,066 people. If the total number of bandits in the province is 30,000, as mentioned in the above statistics, this has weakened their strength by more than 16%. This is even before the start of the grand anti-bandit campaign plan, so the fate of the Guangdong bandits after the launch of this spring anti-bandit offensive can be imagined.

<p>Eastern China's New Lineup</p>
<p>Defeats Qingbai by a Large Margin</p>
<p>Result: Five to One</p>
<p>The Group A football league, which had been suspended for more than a month, continued yesterday. Eastern China faced Qingbai at Yiyuan, with more than 2,000 spectators, which was still enthusiastic. Eastern China, with the help of Xie Jinhong, who had just come to Shanghai from Hong Kong, greatly increased its strength. As a result of the competition, Eastern China lived up to expectations and easily defeated Qingbai by a score of 5 to 1. The score was 2 to 1 in the first half. Qingbai fought bravely and had a great spirit. The referee was Zhang Le, and the linesmen were Wu Shouheng and Chen Jixiang.</p>

<p>Sets a Record</p>
<p>Eastern China attacked first, and Xia Tixian took the lead, shooting from afar, but the ball fell into the wilderness. Qingbai's right forward, Jiang Yueqing, drove straight in, greatly hindering the attack, but he used too little force, and the ball was caught by Banglun. Eastern China's offensive was strong, and Qingbai's hinterland was filled with cavalry. Jiawan lightly passed the ball into Liu Xianhan's arms. Longhai's header also became a wild ball. Chen Mingzhe stirred up another wave, and the ball fell into Qingbai's penalty area. Xie Jinhong scrambled up and headed the ball into the net from the right corner. Eastern China took a 1-0 lead, 11 minutes after the start of the game. At 30 minutes, Longhai received a pass from Jinhong and broke in through a gap. Liu Xianhan fell to the ground in advance, and the ball went into the net again, making it 2-0. Qingbai counterattacked, but they lacked the strength to do so. It was not until the last half minute of the first half that Qingbai's Jing Linggui pulled back a goal. At the end of the first half, Eastern China led 2-1.</p>
<p>Three goals in the second half, After the break, Qingbai's goalkeeper was replaced by Huang Shijie. Eastern China became more and more courageous, and the Qingbai youngsters were caught in a bitter battle. At nine minutes, Longhai shot fiercely from the twelve-yard spot, right in the middle, and rolled straight into Qingbai's goal, making it 3-1. One minute later, General Han revisited the old place. Huang Shijie rushed out in a hurry, right in the middle of Longhai's trap, and jumped up with one foot. Qingbai lost another city, 4-1. After that, the battle situation was that Eastern China did not take advantage of its foundation and defended more than attacked. Although Qingbai tried to cheer up, they could not come up with any good ideas. In the fierce battle until 44 minutes, Longhai penetrated alone, and Qingbai's Fu Natang desperately protected the goal and committed a foul in the penalty area. Xia Tixian took the penalty kick and scored a goal, and the entire game ended with a score of 5-1. Eastern China had four wins in four games, remaining undefeated.</p>

<p>Last week was the first week of March. In the two weeks prior to that, which were the first two weeks after the Lunar New Year, prices had already undergone a period of drastic fluctuation. This fluctuation was extremely fierce and was the first major price cycle fluctuation of the year. During this fluctuation, food, textiles, and chemicals rose the fastest. According to the wholesale price index classified by commodity use compiled by this association, food rose by 71% in the two weeks, chemicals rose by 65% in the same period, textiles rose by 53%, and fuels and building materials rose less. The overall price index rose by 42%.</p>
<p>After these two weeks of sharp price increases, the money market began to tighten at the beginning of last week, and it seemed that this price fluctuation would reach a pause. Originally, the alternating rise and fall of prices, and the alternating relaxation and tightening of the money market, are unavoidable phenomena in the late stage of inflation. To use an analogy, society is like a water storage container, currency is like the water in the container, and the size of the container symbolizes the level of prices. The level of water in the container symbolizes the tightness of the money market. When more water flows into the container than flows out, the water level gradually rises, which means that the money market gradually relaxes. When the container is full, it means that the money market is extremely relaxed. If more water continues to flow in than flows out, the old container will inevitably not be able to accommodate so much water, so the container must be renewed, and its volume must be expanded, which means that the price level will inevitably rise. In the new container, because the capacity is expanded, the old amount of water has not changed, but the water level has been greatly reduced, which means that the money market has tightened again. After that, if the inflow still exceeds the outflow, the above process will be repeated again, cycling endlessly. Prices rise and fall alternately, and the money market relaxes and tightens alternately. But as long as the inflow continues to exceed the outflow, the volume of the container will always gradually expand.</p>
<p>At the beginning of last week, due to the sharp rise in prices in the previous two weeks, the money market tightened, and the prices of all commodities fell back. For example, top-quality white rice fell from 3 million per shi at the end of the previous week to 2.8 million on Monday of last week. Military ship wheat flour fell from 1.32 million per bag to 1.24 million in the same period. 42-count Blue Phoenix fell from 130 million per piece to 103 million. Arrow brand soap fell from 3.77 million per box to 3.6 million. However, the tightening of the money market did not last for two days before it turned to relaxation. The reasons for this will be discussed in the currency and finance section below. As a result, the prices of all commodities rebounded, and this rebound broke the expectation that the price fluctuation at the beginning of the week would temporarily enter a period of respite. Moreover, the rebound continued to increase. Although the money market tightened again at the weekend, the price increase still did not stop. The food market fell into a state of madness again. White rice rose to 3.4 million, 42-count Blue Phoenix rose to 130 million. What is even more alarming is the factory silk. Grade B 83 evenness white factory silk rose from 164 million on Monday to 200 million at the weekend. The prices of all commodities showed new highs, with only chemicals being relatively stable. It is hoped that the money market will be tightened quickly next week, otherwise the price increase at the weekend is likely to spread. The wise financial authorities must have been aware of this and made preparations in advance. The wholesale price index classified by use for last week is as follows:</p>
<p>Category Name Last Week's Index Percentage Change from Previous Week</p>
<p>Food 275,870 Up 6.5%</p>
<p>Textiles 351,630 Up 11.0%</p>

<h3>Pacifying Guangdong Province: A Comprehensive Sweep Begins</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Guangzhou, This Newspaper, 4th] Guangdong Province is rich in resources and currently relatively stable, truly an ideal location for developing its economy. Since Song Ziwen took charge of Guangdong, everyone has cast optimistic eyes on South China's economic construction. Overseas Chinese and foreign businesses, in particular, view Guangdong as fertile ground for investment. We foresee a bright and splendid future for Guangdong's economic development. However, we cannot ignore the issue of local pacification, as unrest is the greatest obstacle to current construction. Therefore, although Song Ziwen has well-laid plans for economic development, observing the actual situation, he cannot but recognize "security first." To build a new Guangdong, eliminating banditry is a prerequisite.</p>
<p>Thirty Thousand Strong, Bandits Account for Half</p>
<p>According to recent statistics from the Guangzhou Pacification Headquarters, the total number of bandits in the province is approximately 30,000. They are distributed as follows: about 5,000 in the Dongjiang area, over 1,600 in the Hanjiang area, over 8,000 in the southern Guangdong area, about 600 in the Pearl River area, over 2,300 in the Xijiang area, over 4,800 in the Beijiang area, and over 6,500 in the Qiongyai area. They harass various parts of Guangdong under the names of "People's Liberation Army" and "Democratic Allied Army." Observing their actions and intentions, it is clear they aim to undermine our grassroots political organizations, disrupt our rear areas, and tie down Nationalist forces. Recently, the Communists declared they would cross the Yangtze River in May, hoping to merge with South China to create a large impression of their strength. From this, it is clear that the Communist plot to destroy South China is considerable. Moreover, even the 30,000 estimated by the Pacification Headquarters is by no means a small number. Isn't that terrifying? But the reality is not quite so. Among these so-called 30,000, the number of true Communists is probably limited, while local thugs and ruffians make up the majority. Most of these bandits are driven to banditry by rural bankruptcy and difficult living conditions, forcing them to take risks, form gangs, and engage in robbery. However, the Communists incite and collude with them, mutually exploiting each other, using their strength to harass various places and create a grand impression of strength. The bandits, on the other hand, use the Communist banner to enhance their reputation and achieve their goals of seizing wealth and goods. Therefore, while such a disorganized rabble is more than capable of harming the locality and undermining government construction, it would be an overestimation to say they are capable of large-scale political rebellion.</p>
<p>Redeployment, Comprehensive Suppression</p>
<p>The Guangdong provincial authorities' plan for suppressing bandits has been redeployed since the Guangdong-Guangxi Pacification Conference was held in Guangzhou last winter, deciding to implement a comprehensive suppression. The province is divided into eight suppression zones, followed by pacification by zone. The commanders of these eight zones were carefully selected by Chairman Song. As a result, Generals He Tong, Ye Zhao, Chen Wenzhao, Zhang Guangqiong, Yu Yingqi, Zhu Juzhi, Liu Qikuan, and Zhang Ruigui were chosen to serve as commissioners and commanders of Zones 1 through 8, respectively. Subsequently, two border area suppression headquarters were established for Guangdong-Hunan-Jiangxi and Guangdong-Fujian. The former was headed by Ye Zhao as commander-in-chief, with Mo Xiongsheng filling Ye's original vacancy as commander of the Second Zone. The latter was headed by Tu Sizong as commander-in-chief, with Chen Quan as his deputy. The commanders of these eight zones and border areas are all well-known generals who have achieved many illustrious feats during the War of Resistance. Moreover, they are very familiar with the situation in their respective zones. Chairman Song invited them to take on the heavy responsibility of pacifying the area, which</p>
