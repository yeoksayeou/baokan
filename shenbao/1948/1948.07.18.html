<h3>外記者報告道華北官方觀察　中共將分裂？　受南國抗拒共產情報局鼓動　關內中共可能脫離毛澤東派</h3>
<p>〔衆社本埠訊〕華北若干官方頃認爲：長城以南之中共將自動脫離與親共產情報局派之中共甚爲可能。彼等並認爲蘇聯將放棄中共，如放棄南斯拉夫然，若彼等認爲中國赤色份千不再對全球共產主義無所裨益。另一方面吿合衆社稱：被等有理由可想信若南斯拉夫抗拒共產情報局及有勇氣繼續其觸立性之國家主義成功，則長城之南之中共，可能與東北之共黨分裂，彼等之理論爲：中國關內之共黨，獲得南其抗夫反抗全球共產主義之立塲成功之鼓勵後，可能與毛澤東及其中央委員會分裂及試探與國民政府成立聯合政府。此一行動，即使爲國民政府考慮或接受，亦非將東北放棄與毛澤東及其共產情報局之共產黨之謂也。相反地，關內內爭將結束，以全力從事古復東北之戰爭。然不能忽略在此項一連串事情發生後，不免與蘇聯發生衝突，按發表此項論調之人仕，乃具有可證明彼等見解之事實。</p>
<h3>內政部發言人　釋明出版法　答新聞界評論</h3>
<p>〔中央社南京十七日電〕內政部發言人稱：南京新民報停刋後，新聞界者論評述，有認爲政府基於維護國家民族之利益，所予該報停刋處分，實屬合理適法者。亦有認政府措施超過合理適法之程度，表示惋惜。甚有對於其所根據之法律表示懷疑者。茲對後者評論觀點，特爲釋明如次：（一）報紙記載違法，如係初次，而情節輕微者，依照出版法第二十八條第二項，自得從寬僅予警吿。惟該報年來違禁記載不一而足，疊經勸導，毫不省悟。近更變本加厲，公然企岡損害國家利益，破壞公共秩序，其情節重大，實已充分構成同法第二十八條第一項所定之懲罰條件，迫使政府不得不出以最後措施。新聞界一部份評論，懷疑政府疏於警告而遽處以永久停刋，未免誤解。伺時亦有若干評論，認爲政府此次處分該報尙嫌太遲，於此益足證明政府之容忍苦心。（二）有謂該款規定失去完整性，不能用以拘束義務人，殊不知該款所禁之「意圖顚覆國民政府，或損害中華民國利益」，旣已包括兩個意義，在適用上自各有其獨立性，不能因前半段事實變更，而影響後半段禁止之效力。所謂失去完整性云云，顯係誤解。（三）憲法第十一條，雖規定人民有言論講學著作及出版之自由，然依第廿三條『以上各條所列舉之自由，除爲防止妨碍他人自由，避免緊急危難，維持社會秩序，或增進公共利益所必要者外，不得以法律限制之」之規定，政府就本條所規定之必要範圍以內，以法律約束人民所享上述自由，旣非憲法所禁止，則現行出版法雖係行憲以前所公布，而基于憲法所認許之必要範圍，政府據以取締妨害國家社會安全之報紙，並無絲毫遠憲之處。報界少數人士昧于此，又不無遺憾。（四）吾人研究出版自由與限制之史實，必須明瞭現代各國出版管理制度，乃因印刷拔術進步，出版事業發生矛盾，不能不有此一法律，用以軌範個人發表自由，保護公衆全體利益。不能以我國在民國三年一度頒訂出版法及報紙條例，而誤指國民政府制訂之現行出版法，爲北京政府時代之產物，從而否認其存在價値。試觀最近聯合國新聞自由會議所制定之人權憲章，曾揭示發表之自由有其相對之義務與責任。幷列舉遠反國家安全之秘密或煽動人民以暴動變動政府等，均應受法律之制裁。可知國家賦與此項自由之法律界限。又如以民主自由見稱於世之英·美兩國取締出版，亦散見於各種法例置則，幷非不予約束，我曆立法體例向屬大陸法系，故管理出版訂有專法，與英美海洋法系之國家採用散在規定者，自難使與强同。少數報紙批評出版法爲刑法以外可有可無之枝節法律，殆於斯義未加深察。要之，法律之爲物，乃人民與政府共同遵由之　範，約束人民正所以約束政府。人民如能於法律範圍內發揮其也版之自由，政府自亦不能予以法外之干涉。故最民主的出版自由，實建立於法治基礎之上。所望全國報業人士，各本法治精神爲出版自由而合作，斯幸甚矣。</p>

<h3>對道德重整運動的二大建議</h3>
<p>— 陳如一</p>
<p>世界道德重整運動十週年紀念大會，最近在美國舉行，出席代表計二百人，來自二十四個國家，討論的主題，在於如何運用道德的力量，處理世界的問題。會議計分兩個階段進行：第一階段，自六月三晶開幕時起，至七日止，在洛杉機好萊塢舉行；第二階段，自六月八日起，改在加州河邊鎭集會，已於十四日閉幕。在閉幕時所發表的聯合聲明中，曾謂「世界今日所進行之戰爭，在基本上，乃思想之戰爭。爲此，以個人自由與人類尊嚴爲基礎之民主生活，亦唯有憑藉理論思想，始能長存不滅，永傳後世』。其結言中並强調謂：「吾人將以重整道德篇民生之不昩理論，而於各國及世界陣綫中，努力奮鬥」。在這世道獲微，人心陷溺之際，這一次的盛會，獨以這德的重整，作爲中心的課題，彷彿暮鼓晨鐘，殊足發人猛省，也帶給了人們無限的希望與期待。</p>
<p>我們完人哲學硏究會同人，近幾年來，正與國內文化界的人士，共同致力於「新道德運動」的提倡，其旨趣適與美國人所領導的道德重整運動，不謀而合。筆者原想將道德重整運動與「新道德運動」的內容，就其時代背景，道德標準，具體主張，與思想本質，分別比較，以期引起大家的注意。惟限於篇幅，不能詳細說明。好在兩者，均欲藉此轉移世風，重建世界道德，藉使舉世人士共趨於至善的境域。故筆者願以十二萬分的誠意，對於今後世界的道德建設問題，提出二大建議，以供世人的研究：</p>
<p>第一，定期召關「國際道德會議」。歷史上的國際道德會議，曾爲一九一二年及一九一四年，迭在倫敦荷蘭，先後舉行兩次；但自大戰以來，則已久無消息。因爲國興國間，大家不顯伯義，遂致條約等於廢紙，和平失其保障。為求維護世界和平，增進人類編祉，亟應定期再關一次大規模的國際道德會議，務使全球各國，一致參加。完人學會於去年四月十二日的年會中，對此已曾有所建議。旋舉社會部去年六月七日指復：「俟與有開機關會商後，再行核辦」。去年十一月十八日，萬國道德總會，在北平召開勝利後第一屆全體會員代表大會，也曾決議響應，一致主張。本年三月十四日，聯合國中國同志會在京舉行會員大會，筆者曾向大會提案，建議由聯合國定期召開國際道德會戰；而以一九五〇年八月二十七日孔子誕辰二千五百週年時，在我中國舉行，最爲相宜。開會地點，或在首都，或在杭州，皆無不可。如果屆時國內局勢比較安定，能在山東曲阜孔子誕生的聖地舉行，意味自更深長。當經大會決議，交理監事聯席會議硏討在案。頃接聯合國中國同志會六月十二日來函內稱：「茲經本屆第」一次理監事聯席會議決議，以國際道德重整會議，業於美國舉行，本會由陳理事立夫前往出席，本案保留」等語。査此次世界道德重整運動十週年紀念大會，雖係一國際性的集會，論其本質，實與學術團體之年會相似，且以基督敎爲出發點，雖然有二十四個國家出席代表計二百人，但事實上尙不及全球所有國家之半數，其決議案，無拘東力。它顯然不足以替代正式之國際道德會議。本人以爲中二國，在東西兩半球中，分負道德上的最大責任；此事可由中美兩國政府會商後，聯合徽求各國同意。最近我國當軸，有意邀請這德重整運動諸位領袖，來華觀光，參加祭孔大典。聯合國文化敎育科學組織，也曾由於中國委員會之建議，於一九五〇年時，可能在我中觀舉行大會。如能適時舉行國際道德會議，實爲一舉數得之事。現距預定會期，爲時不過兩載，各項籌備工作，眞該平日農開，以便應付那一個偉大的塲面。</p>
<p>第二，從連制訂「人類道德憲章」。自從一九四五年聯合國憲章簽訂後，續有世界敎育懸章，世界人權憲章等之產生，都是人類進步的里程碑。我們以爲道德方面，人類也要簽訂一個類似的憲章，俾作行爲上的準則。究人學會於去年四月二日舉行年會時，曾決議編訂「道德典範」，內容分爲總稱，以及各種門類的範疇，如政治道德·商業道德·律師道德·醫師道德·著作道德·婚姻道德·……等是。因爲茲事體大，牽涉過廣，尙在徵集資料，着手整理之中。而且世界各民族間的理想人格，朱盡一致，譬如英國推重「君子」，蘇聯祟拜「英雄」，德國企慕「超人」，……其他各國，也有不同的目標。我們以爲人類的典型，應以「完人」作爲共同的最髙理想。我們所謂一人類道德憲章」的範圍，自較原擬的「道德典範」，更爲廣泛。須由各國主管機關，學術團體，會同各科專家，擷取各國的倫理思潮與善良風俗，分別提供具體方案，然後詳細審訂，集其大成，務使融貫中西，溝通新舊。一「人類道德憲章」草案的內容，事先自應廣爲　譯各國文字，藉使彼此充分交換意見，以待一九五〇年八月二十七日舉行之「國際道德會議」，再行詳加討論，正式通過。預定會期十日，至多半月。然後由各國出席代表，分別携回本國，於數日中，經過各國人民以莊嚴的方式一致接受後，進行換文簽訂的手續。預計於一九五一年一月一日，可由全世界各種日報期刋，同時隆重予以公佈，藉作全體人類共同獲守的行篇規範。那末，此後國隊的　紛，與人類的悲劇，自然一定可以逐漸消弭於無形。它正如大時代的指路碑一樣；自二十世紀五十年代起，整個人類的生活，政可因此面邁入一新階段。而那一次的「四際道德會議」，也就完成了它最莊嚴神聖的任務了！我們相信：新道德後統的樹立，實爲建設新世界秩序的先決條件。我國的倫理哲學，素爲世界有識之士所共仰，今後對於「人類道德憲章」的起草與審釘，自應着盡其最大之努力了！</p>
<p>在目前，道協的崩潰興幻滅，已成公認的事實；因此十道德的重整與新生，實為當前最迫切的任務。別說「道高一尺魔高一丈」。我們相信：正義的力量，必能獲得最後的勝利！我門要效法出原的髙風亮節，以衆醉獨淸的精神，轉移一代的風氣；而以消極退隱爲戒。我們要效法鍾馗的正氣壯志，以除惡務盡的精神，掃蕩社會的敗類；而以姑息　奸爲戒。我們知道，在世界上，好人往往孤立，以致受到挫折。語云：「二人同心，其利斷金一。「一矢易折，衆矢難摧」。剝極而復，革故鼎新；此正其時，非異人任！惟有好人趕快區結起來，總能挽救當前的危局！曾文正公說：「風俗之厚薄奚自乎？自乎一二人之心之所　而已」。但欲轉移人心，任重道遠，自非一手一足之烈，亦非一朝一夕之功。今後「新道德運動」的推行，端賴舉世志士仁人，共起贊助，以期風行草　，克收普遍倡導率之功；並且深願能與道德重整運動的主持人士，携手合作，俾便集中力量，共挽狂瀾於既倒。庶幾　家理想之大同世界，與夫基督教義之地上天國，都不難同時實現於人間，這就是道德重整的後果，這也就是道德新生的遠景！</p>

<p>〔本報廣州十六日電〕（運到）中港邊界沙魚加，十五日繼沙頭角後，又遭匪突製。匪軍約二百人，十五日晨襲沙魚涌，駐軍一五四旅某營即起而應戰，激戰達五小時，匪屢攻不下，直至午十二時，防軍以後援不繼，由營長王顯眞率領退入沙頭角，防軍傷亡約二十餘人，被俘士兵約四十餘人，另海關關員被俘二十餘人。現宋子文主任對中港邊境已採緊急揹施，嚴令防軍及愛安縣府嚴密執行戒嚴法令。據邊界來人談：該處現入封鎖戒嚴狀態，國軍兩團已開達邊界一帶佈防，將對匪展開掃蕩。據港訊：此次匪軍係由曾生指揮，率匪達二千餘人，企圖破壞廣九路交通。東南亞英軍總司令曾於十六日最往新界巡視。又據穗綏署政工處長謝鎭南語記者稱：沙魚涌係由港人東江孔道，亦爲私梟走私基地，我海關設有關卡於此，匪此次突獲目的，似爲海關，因匪包庇走私，勒收行水，故對我防軍及海關早已含恨。</p>

<h3>鄒秉文對記者談　復興農村工作　主持機構最近即成立</h3>
<p>〔本報訊」記者昨訪中華農學會會長鄒秉文博士，微詢對利用美援復興我國農村之意見，承談：「農村復興工作，爲國家平時應做的事情，茲特美援撥到，再談農村復興工作，已感可恥，然接受人家援助後，而工作仍做不好，則更屬可恥。事情要辦得好，不外兩點：（一）有計劃，（二）主持得人，據個人所知，中國尙無復與農村之計劃。這次全國與農業，水利，地政各方面有關的廿一個團體，爲對政府貢獻意見，曾草擬一部中國農村復興計劃，丙容注重三點：（一）農業增產，因爲農村最大宗的是農產品，在國內商業上最佔重要地位的是農產品，而國家每年化錢最多向外輸入的也是農產品，故農業增產，應佔首要地位。（二）水利：農業增產除了農業本身技術以外，最重要的就是水利問題。水太多或太少，均足以影饗增產。（三）農田地政：農村最重大的資產是農田，土地改革是經濟也是政治的問題故復興農村工作，不得不注意到地政問題。這次廿一個關係團體，集合了四十多位專家，化了三週時間，硏討結果，準備了一部計劃送陳政府，日來農林·水利，地政三部，已資助印刷經費，決定將該項計劃刋印數千册，本月廿二百就可出版，各界如有需要，可向南京雙龍巷中華農學會函索。個人未便奢言該項計劃如何究善，惟以廿一個團體，集四十餘位專家硏討的結晶，不能不說是對國家的一種貢獻，關於農村復興工作的主持機構，聽說最近就快成立美援農村復興委員會，委員人數，由中國總統聘任三人，美國總統聘任二人，廿一團體曾對中美雙方關係的主持人說過，這些委員人選，必須要注意到，須具有專門的技術和行政的能力，中國委員三人須就農業，水利，地政三一方面各聘專才，美國委員二人，也須就此三方面加以延聘，千萬不可以「百搭」的人才充數，則事業成功，方有希望。</p>
<h3>浙兩大施政方針　確保治安與增加生產　陳儀稱已作初步籌劃</h3>
<p>〔本報杭州十七日電〕陳儀主席昨晚首次招待記者，闡明施政方針爲確保治安與增加生產，前者已作初步籌劃，即調整行政督察區專員，，專司軍事是也。陳氏爲元成二大任務，先從健全機構，澄淸吏治始，故先行公文革命，主張分層負責，改用白話文，並健全人事制度，使縣長之調動如銀行經理然。末謂：渠歡迎各界批評，蓋眞理愈辯愈明也。嗣由各報記者提供意見，以供當局參攷。</p>

<h3>美增援駐歐空軍　超空堡壘六十架飛抵英　短期內飛德作轟炸演習</h3>
<p>〔聯合社英國斯康普敦十七日電〕美國大批超空堡壘今日由對日與對德兩役老練戰士駕駛飛抵英國，在東英吉利機塲三處降落，是爲美空軍戰後在歐洲眩示實力之規模最大一次。其中第二十八隊將以此間爲基地，第三百另七隊則分佈於馬山與華丁登兩地，該兩地均有較長跑道，可供巨型轟炸機停留。</p>
<p>〔路透社林肯郡馬克漢十七日電〕由美飛英將在英空軍基地暫駐之超空堡壘六十架，由於大西洋上有密雲或將延遲抵達，至今午爲止，已抵英國三處機塲者僅十三架。美第二十八航空隊隊長乘首先抵英之一架超空堡壘降陸後談稱，此行另例有的練習飛行，與飛往日本者相同。過去曾有多次此等飛行，今後將有更多之此種飛行。渠復曰，機上或有若干供練習用之彈藥，但決非用以射人者。同時駐歐美空軍總司令李梅中將在德境美軍區之維斯巴登談稱，超空堡壘或將與現駐德國之美戰鬥機及轟炸機同作轟炸演習，超空堡壘或將不時在德境美軍區降陸。倫敦觀察家認美超空堡壘之抵默，乃與柏林危機直接有關之示威行動。</p>
<p>〔路透社倫敦十七日電〕在柏林危機賡續期間，此等美　將繼續留駐歐洲。美機在英時將使用英空軍基地，未證實之報告謂，法空軍之基地朮將借與美機使用。隨超空堡壘抵英之美空軍人員達一千五百人之多，修理人員及供應品將絡續由其他飛機輸抵英國。先是英空軍部亦宣布皇家空軍亦擬調用轟炸機，以補助柏林之空運制度。</p>
<p>〔聯合社倫敦十六日電〕美駐英大使館今日宣布，美國決派遣B29型超空堡壘六十架來英，作短期練習，此乃戰略空軍部一年餘前規定之畏程飛行計劃之一部份，在英留駐兩星期至四星期後，然後飛往德國，歸歐洲美空軍司令李梅指揮。目前德境已有超空堡壘三十架。倫教晚報認爲大隊轟炸機開到，象徵蘇軍封鎖柏林以來西方國家之首次大示威。據稱，此種飛機雖不參加接濟柏林之空運工作，但西方國家準備全力抵抗干涉空中供應綫之任何企圖</p>
<h3>美重視柏林局勢　國會定本月廿六召開將會　為對付蘇聯事先制訂辦法</h3>
<p>〔中央社華盛頓十七日電〕今冬美國大選後，無論杜威得勝共和黨當權，或杜魯門蟬聯民主黨繼續秉政，美國之外交政策均不致有重大變動，兩黨均保證繼續執行旣定之兩黨外交政策於國際問題中負起領導責任，並與友黨共同推進建設性之和平計劃，對抗共產主義之擴張。國會已定七月廿六日舉行特別會議，社魯門及政府中外交政策負責大及國會雙方，將於數週內就外交問題密切聯絡，俾制訂辦法對付蘇聯在德國所採之政策。</p>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓十六日電〕官方今夜宣稱：美國增强駐歐空軍，實爲應付柏林局勢中一種有力行動。美英法三國政府現正考慮最後採取强硬報復辦法以對付蘇聯，藉以打破柏林封鎖，必要時並將實行經濟制裁。大批美機集中於英國，實爲戰後創舉，此事雖非指美空軍將在該地立即恢復大規模行動，但可證明英美兩國政府對於在軍事與政治上處理柏林問題，，已獲致密切合作。空軍當局强調B廿九型轟炸機派往英國僅屬練習性質，但歐洲局勢如此緊張，該批美機與蘇聯近在柏林之威脅兩者之關係甚爲明顯，殊非官方私下否認柏林局勢爲空軍調動原因所能掩飾。另據消息靈通人士稱，初次使用武力大致將以禁止蘇聯船隻通渦巴拿瑪運河爲限，其理由即蘇聯亦嘗拒絕美方車輛進入柏林。至於實施經濟制裁，除西方各國外，並將商請其他各國合作制裁。此外尚擬派兵保護卡車至柏林，飭令其在必要時突破蘇軍之障礙物。</p>
<h3>柏林西區　兇電貯糧</h3>
<p>〔路透社倫敦十六日電〕西方盟國今日在柏林西區頃佈若干新措施，包括减少供給工業用之電流，及禁止載運糧食煤斤之汽車駛離柏林西區。據英方發言人稱，關於後者之禁令，將由德國警察執行，目的在防止空運至柏林西區之糧食流入食區。</p>

<p>〔路透社倫敦十七日電〕英國已重向蘇聯要求賠償四月間在柏林上空與蘇機互撞墮毁之維金式客機一架及殞命人員之損失。消息靈通方面相信。蘇聯如不允賠償，英國將向國際法庭控訴。</p>
<h3>傅蘇蒙軍在德境　與德人衝突</h3>

<h3>柏林通西德空中走廊　蘇機群練習飛行　目的在干擾英美空運</h3>
<p>〔路透社柏林十七日電〕在西德與柏林間空中走廊內作練習飛行之蘇聯戰鬥機，今日數量突見增多。蘇機開始在該處作練習飛行雖已有數日，然參加機羣至今日突然大增，不無干擾西方盟國空運之意。同時西方盟國則已採取步驟，以增加西德至柏林之空運量。英國四引擎之約克機及原來往來歐洲與遠東問之皇家空軍四引擎運輸機，多已調來德境服務，皇家空軍總司令泰德元帥昨抵柏林視察空運情况，英軍駐德總司令羅勃森特自法闌克福趕回柏林與泰德晤談。</p>
<p>〔合衆社柏林十七日電〕蘇聯十七日通知西方，蘇聯將在交通擁擠之柏林空中走廊內加緊空中活動，其中包括在雲層密佈時舉行盲目訓練飛行。蘇聯通知四强空中安全管制中心，將利用走廊附近機塲九處，此舉顯在進一步推動神經戰，可能竟係對英美空輸之直接恐嚇。柏林氣候惡劣，故空輸進行受阻。德國人士稱，此間蘇空軍司令亞力山特洛夫與參謀商討消減空中走廊兩三處之方法。</p>
<p>〔合衆社柏林十六日電〕美機於十六日下午四時至之廿四小時內，共飛行二五一次，運抵一，四三五噸粉食煤及物資至柏林。英機共飛行二一八次，估計有八七二噸物資運抵柏林。</p>

<p>〔路透社巴黎十七日電〕外交界人士相信，法國對於柏林局勢及西德政治發展的態度，與英美似尚有距離。據確息，法國已在從事非正式的試探，以探知舉行四强會議以謀打破柏林僵局的可能性。法國感覺目前西方强國茍就柏林局勢採取最後較量的態度，尚嫌過早，法國深盼十九日在海牙舉行之西歐聯盟五國外長會議，可以糾正若干過早較量的態勢。美國雖不擬與會，但將由西歐聯盟以開會情形充分知照美國。賴依稱葛氏將出席聯大</p>

<h3>兩航空公司　無法再維持　暫停旅客登記　電部請求兩點　京滬班機今起完全停航</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕我國僅有之兩大民航事業中國航空公司及中央航空公司，因最近汽油價格迭次飛漲，開支激增，營業達於無法維持之境地，決定自今日起暫行停止所有旅客登記，已登記者則仍盡力疏運，　運及緊爭運輸亦仍勉力維持，一方面電呈交通部速謀解決辦法，請求（一）准予按照牌價結匯，而不用結匯證明書辦法。（二）如不可能實行時，照　行運價增加百分之一百五十至二百。此項請求如不獲批准，空中運輸或有全部停頓之可能。中國航空公司納經理劉敬宜，財務主任王鶴齡，中央航空公司總經理陳卓林，副總經理查鎭湖，昨日下午特聯合招待記者，解釋兩公司實際情形，希望各界予以明瞭諒解。據央航查副總經理稱：兩航空公司自抗戰時期以來，始終在靼　情形下盡力維持，但現則經濟狀况已迫使面臨最大危機。兩公司航運成本中，須以外匯支付者，佔百分之七十以上，包括（一）汽汕，（二）零件，（三）飛行人員之薪津。其中汽油一項爲最主要之支出，當三四月間汽油漲至每加侖十餘萬時，運價曾調整兩次，政府並規定侮月可向中央銀行按牌價結匯二十五萬美金，故當時收支尚能相抵。五月份油價再漲，運費未調整，六月份結匯證明書辦法頒佈，油價連跳數倍，運費雖調整兩次，然相差太遠，統計至本月十六日止，成本較二月份時增加百分之二五四四，而遝費則僅增加百分之八一六。同時因按牌價結匯辦法取消，公司無力支付結匯證明書之匯差，自六月八日以來，賴中央銀行借款維持，計中國航空公司借到一萬一千餘億，中央航空公司借到八千餘億，此項借款至本月二十日爲止，如當局不予設法，此後空運即難予維持，故不得不自今日起暫停旅客登記。關於向政府請求之兩點，不用結匯證明書辦法如事實上難於實現，則調整運價乃爲必爭，蓋現時我國之航空運費實爲世界上最低廉之國家，如以美國爲例，每英哩之運費爲七·穴五分美金，自紐約至華盛頓票價十七元，距離相等於自上海至南京，而現時京滬票價合美金不到一元云。</p>
<p>〔又訊〕中國中央兩航空公司，昨晚聯合發出通告。因油價飛漲，不堪賠累，不得已暫將京滬綫完全停航，其他各綫如滬平滬渝滬穗等綫之航班，則將縮减班次，以期减少損失，至航空函件，則仍儘量繼續載運。</p>

<p>昨日下午五時，吳市長在市府辦公室中接見各報記者，據稱此次赴京，除參加會議外，曾晋謁行政院翁院長，並分訪財政部長王雲五，糧食部長關吉玉，報告本市最近物價情况。中樞當局亦認爲物價狂漲，係全國性經濟問題，決非上海一地領導。即以米價爲例，十六日吳市長在京時，該地米價即較上海爲高。吳氏稱：美援於八月底即可運用，其中有二千萬美金係用于穩定金融者，足以彌補通貨膨脹，深信今後物價可告平穩。</p>
<p>關於本市財政困難情形，吳市長曾向財政部王部長有所陳述，</p>
<p>請求撥給補助費每月二萬億元，以彌補赤字，王部長於原則上表示同意，將提出行政院會議通過後施行之。</p>

<h3>行動極度敏捷的　市警局飛行堡壘　值勤隊員的神經無時不在緊張之中</h3>
<p>〔本報特寫〕在最近半年來本市所發生的許多重大刑事案件中，警局飛行堡壘給予大衆的印象是異常淸新而明快的。行動迅述，效果確實，大塲面上，面對着驚人的紛擾，每一個隊員好像都有那麼無限深厚的活力，自始至終控制着一切。</p>
<p>對於這一份活力的培養，警察局是經過很多苦心策劃的。從全市萬餘長警中，考選了六十個隊員，從千百內外動人員中，委派了兩個總副指揮，四個指揮官，再加上幾部機動車輛，這就是他們全部的組織。但是這裏而已經容納了行政，法律，刑事的專家，將近卅種以上的方言，射擊，駕駛，搏鬥，游泳等十餘項現代化技能，以及許多新頴的科學的智識。這一支淸一色年靑未婚的隊伍，成立到現在不過半年，市中區尤其是銀行區的盜案顯然激减了，對於這事實的適當解釋：是强盜恐懼他們的新式捕捉技術，更怕的是捕捉速度縮短得足以威脅動手搜劫的時間。</p>
<p>四十五秒鐘內出動</p>
<p>飛行堡壘出動的速率，何以這樣高？這是由於電訊控制室有一個高度的性能。事主用一二二二〇或一五三八〇的電話報警，控制室在未細詢事由前，立刻先掀　鈴，警鈴響聲未畢，機動車輛就已經駛出待命，隊員們便在車上穿着保險馬甲，整頓械彈，拂拭探照燈，等到指揮官獲得詳確命令，登車開動，全部過程不出四十五秒。根據他們留下的紀錄，夜間由隊部開到光華大學十三分錡，白盡開到大光明戯院則需要十五分鐘，儘管警車一路吶喊，浩蕩無阻，但是擁塞的交通，仍舊使他們到達時間，略有參差。</p>
<p>原來一塲夫婦爭吵</p>
<p>隊員們在值時間內，神經的緊張是任何職業所不能比擬的，時時刻刻諦聽着警鈴，隨時隨地準備着厮殺。指揮官更辛勞了，每天祗有三小時的休息，一遇警報，他要負責對去向保守秘密，臨時在車上指示，爲的是防止司機與外界勾串；到達現塲，他要以車頭有色燈光指揮部隊集散，和動止。他們每次在隊部中靜止待命的時候，緊張的情緒下常對出事地點存着幻念：盜匪，群衆，暴徒……迅速地制伏它！祗等警鈴響。有一次警鈴響了，他們興奮地趕到現塲，什麼動靜都沒有，一探聽，原來是小夫婦兩口吵了架，女的不肯吃虧，搶出來打電話給飛行堡壘求援，他們剛到達，這對夫婦已經破涕爲笑，和好如初了。</p>
<p>辯才無礙智退羣衆</p>
<p>飛行堡壘到目前為止，浴血鬥爭的事件並不太多，智退頑敵的表現倒頗有成就。靜安區一次大劫案，十二個隊員和盜匪實力懸殊，他們應用了迂緩包圍的方法，使目標延續到大隊人馬抵達後成擒。前晚大華，國泰兩影院，因漲價後限價票的糾紛，引起觀衆鼓噪，據說他們就應用了口若懸河的辯才，在民主而又溫和的方式下，穩定了無教企圖衝進戯院的羣衆。</p>
<p>由去年十二月到今年六月底，從飛行堡壘出動次數的統計上，我們可以看到上海一般治安情况：盜警卅四，工潮十三，學潮六，暴動八，突擊檢查六十九，警鈴誤響四十，偵查失車四十七。</p>
<p>我們要瞭解這社會動亂對每一個人生活的影響，我們實在應該先瞭解飛行堡壘對我們每一個市民的關切，以及它爲我們所擔負的辛勞。</p>

<h3>兩戲院軍人擲彈慘案　警備部嚴訊所捕疑犯</h3>

<p>青年軍旅長　談調查經過</p>
<p>駐本市靑年軍二〇二師第二旅方旅長頃語記者稱：本旅擔任淞滬防務，有維護地方治安之責，所有官兵尚能嚴守紀律，愛護民衆，前晚兩戲院發生血案，本人接警備司令部楊副司令電後，即派劉參謀長昌太，政工處沈主任敏分赴大舞台共舞台查辦，另派士兵一速，在四川北路天通菴路一帶警戒檢查有無本旅士兵來往，本人並親往江灣各營房集合官兵點名，得悉本旅並無官兵外出。旋據沈主任電話報告，謂警備司令部已查悉滋事者爲過境部隊士兵，與本師並無關迎，本人始命警戒部隊撤回營房。至在大舞台門口被捕之第六團士兵沈德明，係在慘案發生後，適經該處，致被誤捕，此爲偶然事件，幷非參加滋事者。惟第六團係駐於南匯一帶，該兵何故來滬，有無差假，已飭該管主官澈查究辦。關於近來屢有過境軍人在本市滋事，以及假冒軍人案件層出不窮，本旅決商承警備司令部會同憲警執行取締，以維秩序。</p>

<h3>舞潮案審結　廿三日宣判　昨邀攝影記者作證　律師請求交保未準</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕前日審訊竟日之舞劃案，昨晨九時半，在地院第二庭，由鍾顯達推事，繼續審問。被告除　葉玲因病未到外，餘均到庭應訊。十一時廿五分，開始辯論，迄下午二時半始畢。宣告辯論終結，定於廿三日下午二時宣判。</p>
<p>當九時卅五分鍾推事偕檢察官書記官升庭後，首傳訊證人嵩山警局司機楊本君，李毛毛，顧林生諸人，本報攝影記者顧廷鵬，時事攝影社記者黃彰才，大公報記者韓澄清，亦均被邀作證，各證人所稱多與被告有利。</p>
<p>十一時廿五分，黄達平檢察官起立宣讀起訴書後，被告律師，開始辯論。周一志爲朱　等十六人辯護，首謂各被告之犯罪，乃因少數官吏，不知失業之嚴重，未經立法院通過，即以一紙命令禁舞，特種刑庭上已有多人說到。特種刑庭裁定不受理此案，爲賢明，希望審判長，仍本此旨作最後決斷。</p>
<p>周律師續稱：被告願全爲譏餓所迫，並非預謀，查請願在憲法上，原爲合法舉動，起訴書亦寫明「當時羣衆經此意外刺激……」。又稱：「該局正在開會，未能及時出見……至引起誤會……由於羣衆心理所鼓動……」，由此可知：（一）社會局應付無方，（二）羣衆心理與個人犯罪不同，不能併爲一談，故此僅篇偶然發生之科紛，非暴動可比。又請願人數共達四千餘，其中眞正打人毀物者，早已逃去，問心無愧者反被拘捕。至於社會局究竟損失若干，受傷之人有無傷單，請審判長注意。</p>
<p>最後又謂：起訴書謂被告諸人，爲生活所迫，一時情感衝動而犯法，故請用刑法第五十九條减刑條例，從輕處分，但檢察官所引用之起訴條文爲刑法第一三六條後段，按此條僅能引用於妨害公務員執行職務，但事實上此次糾紛，並未以公務員爲對象，故所引用之條文，殊屬不合，揆情度理僅，能引用刑法第三五二·三五四條毁棄損壞罪，再加第五十九條减刑，始爲公允云云。</p>
<p>其後各被告辯護律師紛紛起立發言，大體與前段所述相同·王扶　强調被　押諸人，其被押時間，或已超過應受拘禁日期，應請准予交保。</p>
<p>下午二時半，辯諭究畢，鍾推事宣告定於廿三日下午二時宣判。在押各被告，仍行還押，惟如因病經法醫證明者，可准予交保，始告退庭。</p>

<h3>割腦療瘋術（三）　青年醫師　劉明鐸的新成就</h3>
<p>— 本報特派員　邵慎之</p>
<p>〔本報靑島十二日航訊〕二等兵劉少之，貴州人，四十一歲，在作戰時，一顆巨型砲彈在不遠處爆炸，他應聲倒地，不省人事，沒有受傷，醒來後即發在。本年一月十三日入院，經診斷是精神乖離症（Schnzophrena），他的病象是喜怒哀樂無常，常自言自語，語題廣泛，反覆嚕嘛，令人不耐。在走廊窗下對外喃喃不絕，在同一地方，日必數次。除姓名籍貫外，餘均答非所問。動作遲鈍，每一小動作保持很長時間，並且亳無意義。食物正常。行爲鹵　，常找人打架。所有事物漠不關心，只顧自理日常生活，但沒有特點。</p>
<p>這瘋人在六月十八日上午十時實施，Lobotomy，十二時手術完畢經過情形良好。現在已恢復正常。本月八日，劉明鐸被邀出席醫學會靑島分會作報告時，應會員之請，將劉少之帶去，坐了軟的汽車，身臨那麼一個塲面，神經緊張了一下，有些不舒服，現在正躺着休養。</p>
<p>「病患者在割治之後，特別需要精神上的溫暖啊！」</p>
<p>另外一個是廿歲的廣東人二等兵鄭漢章，三月一日入院，在症歷上作如下的記載：「病者家屬無從調查，據稱僅全家一人從未染過性病或其他傳染病，去年曾於左腿受槍傷，經部隊治愈，愈後歸隊。頭部從未受傷。曾讀書二年，能寫自己姓名，從軍兩年，作戰勇敢，曾殺死敵人數名。」</p>
<p>他的病象是常呈憂鬱，雙眉緊蹙，沉默不語，有時却獨自高歌。或者喃喃不絕。衝動起來，便搗毁室內用具，撕破被服。忽然潛逃無踪，二三天後重又回醫院。同他談話，答非所問。回報姓名却很快。過去的事情大抵可以記得，稍稍詳細一點，就答不出來。常常疑心別人要謀害他，獨自關在房內，只顧整理自己的衣服，很整齊，把所有的東西放在衣服中，不問外界的一切。窒外吵鬧，一概不理。入夜，就呈不安狀態，失眠。食慾是正常的。有時非常頑固，髒的衣服不肯換，頭髮不肯理。新的學習不感興趣，過去所學的沒有忘記，常常反復一個動作，常有無恥表現。不知錢的數目。喜歡吹牛，誇大自己作戰的勇敢。</p>
<p>就是這樣一個瘋人。這個瘦小的中國人所表現的瘋態，是很顯然的：他完全給現生活所壓毁了！</p>

<h3>市塲人心興奮　華股漲風仍烈</h3>
<p>華股昨人心興奪異常，漲風仍烈。永紗漲停後略加，新光信誼等亦曾漲停，惟加水現象，迄難持久，中途有十次掙扎，終以小股軟弱，並有增加證金之訊，午刻未免小回。</p>
<p>晨　即承前收餘風，永紗開高至一〇九〇〇元。開後即由一六三號九五號一二六號進至漲停板，並加價百餘元，一六九號二一八號一六三號六七號二二五號一八三號二二號一四五號及廣帮二〇二號力售，退至一〇七七〇元。一五六號二二四號七一號一三一號三號一七八號九九號一六三號一五號都進，中途有八九次再行漲停。新光漲停後有回，信誼永業則站漲限，掙扎至近午，聞有提高身份證據金之訊，而現鈔奇緊，銀根亦未見寬至若何程度，午後由一〇四號一二二號一六號一三一號二二五號一八五號一五六號一四五號二一八號四號脫手，退至一〇七五〇元收市，新華且告跌停。較前收計信誼聯華永業漲停板，閘北平平，景綸新華低一成，中泯漲一成，信和火柴國貨商務中法低半成，新光恒鹽五和華新漲半成，餘股榮辱供微。塲外谷未上市股票，銀行股稍疲，文化股紡織股穩定，五洲及公用股則極俏利。</p>

<h3>棉紗布初漲後回　塲外細布曾叩五千萬大關</h3>
<p>昨日棉紗市况，初開以津粵等帮採辦尚佳，人心仍堅，業外亦有拉抬。四十二支藍鳳紗，喊開明日（十九日）出貨，二十億大關。嗣因貨主迫於頭寸，急於售現，霎時喊低至十八億，當日出，市氣轉平，中途本客帮趁小吸進回上五千萬，卒聞當局通知布市暫停集會，檢查成單等不利消息，最後週一出貨以十七億五千萬元結束，比上日軋升五千萬元。四十支卅二支亦先漲後回。二十一支雙馬現紗，初做十四億，各方買意濃厚，瞬即喊高一億，近收時同業及浮多乘高了結，終以現出爲十三億五千萬，軋升九千萬。隔日出十四億二千萬，軋升一億二千萬元，其餘各紗亦呈堅挺，成交二百四十餘件。</p>

<h3>茶商要求四聯總處　放寬茶貸額度　定明日謁俞總裁請願</h3>
<p>上海茶输出業同業公會爲吸收多量外匯維持國際市塲，活潑我國農村經濟計，擬請四聯總處將茶貸額度酌量放寬，以資週轉。特於昨日（十七日）下午三時由唐季珊主持，假永安十樓招待各報社記者，說明問題之重要，希望新聞界予以有力支援。該會除已於十五日電呈有關當局，陳述原委外，並定下週推派代表晋謁國行兪總裁，或將晋京請願。唐氏在招待會中謂，華茶在國際貿易上，若不急起直追，恐將日趨沒落。一觀美國茶葉公會發表世界茶產銷數字，可知梗概。例如去年度英·美·加拿大·澳洲向錫闌·印度購進之紅茶，即達五億三千五百萬磅。內英國三億七千萬磅，加拿大四千四百萬磅，美國七千一百萬磅，澳洲五千萬磅。反觀我國去年向外輸出紅綠茶，僅三千萬磅。內紅茶佔三分之一，比之錫闌印度相差箐壞。若以我國全產量計算，年可達一百萬担，即一億一千萬磅。是則銷路僅十一分之三，足見貨棄于野，大好外匯未能爭取，實深可惜。孫曉村報告茶葉實際成本，據稱：令僅就平水區茶葉生產成本而論，毛茶山價以及茶用材料廠租包裝做工挑工等費，均按米價折合計算。本年毛茶收價每担等於食米二石，而箱茶每担之情製包裝等費約等于食米一石六斗，自產地運至出口地點之上海，所需運費等于食米四斗，到滬後所有運輸及存倉損耗倉租保險等費等于食米四斗，又自收製成箱到申時四十五天，另出口地箱茶抵押一月爲期，共計七十五天，貸款利息及自資部份所負高利貸，約等於食米二石，祗此數項茶之成本估計，每担已約等於食米六石四斗。按照政府茶貸最高額爲每祖一千萬元，僅合食米數斗之値，不及成本十分之一。至此孫氏復强調茶貸額度不能提高，非僅生產受窒，即國際市塲亦多誤解，以爲貸額低微，顯見成本不大，何能以高價在外傾銷。最後復由葉世昌及宋啓範相繼發言，葉氏對歷年茶葉價格比較，如卅五年十億資本可購茶三千五百担，去年則降爲一千担。今年雖有五百億資本，祗能購茶二百担，茶商資金之浩大，可見一斑。宋氏則對目前國際市塲有所報告，至四時餘始散。</p>

<p>校史概述　民國十四年六月三日，聖約翰大學本國敎職員十九人，學生五五三人，因愛國運動齜校，共謀自建大學，王省三先生慨捐上海大西路地六十餘畝以爲校基，張詠霓朱經農二先生分別籌措經費，規劃教科。賃屋於前法祖界霞飛路，以爲大學校舍，又以新西區楓林橋畔爲中學校舍，定校名曰光華。九月七日開學，舊約翰學生皆來歸，新生亦聞風興起，爲收回教育權而自設之大學遂告成立，推張詠霓爲校長，朱經農爲教務長，設文理商工四枓。翌年春校舍興工，秋間落成，大學部先遷入。十八年六月一日教育部令准立案，是年秋遵照部頒大學組織改爲文，理，商三院，十九年春兼收女生</p>
<p>十週紀念　二十四年立校十週紀念，並值張校長六秩大慶，師生校友及各界熱心人士，咸集鉅款，添建校舍，以資紀念。有自鑿之自流井，有自備之電燈廠，有同學會捐建之療養院，校基且擴充爲百數十畝。二十六年，中日戰事爆發，校舍於十一月十二，三日全部相繼爲敵人焚燬。張校長聞訊，曾親至大西路鐡軌側，佇立遠望火燄，泫然涕泣者多時。學校一遷越界築路區域，再遷入租界，照常上課。二十七年，商學院院長謝霖在川將分校籌備就緒，在蓉開辦。四川省府及紳商各界或撥款補助建築經費，或捐贈校基。</p>
<p>艱苦時期　三十年秋，太平洋戰爭忽起，張校長深知敵人將加緊壓力，乃決將滬校在表面上停辦，一面由文學院長及各系主任組織委員會，公推文學院長蔣竹莊主持「誠正文學社」，理商學院長及各系主任組織委員會，公推經濟系主任唐慶增主持「格致理商學社」，附中主要教職員組織委員會，公推吳遐齡主持「壬午補習社」。三社向教育部備案，一切遵照部令辦理。因不公開招生，學生人數逐年遞减，經濟均陷於窘境。該校張校長以憂時積勞成疾，在勝利前二十七日在滬與世長辭。</p>
<p>復校前後　治日寇投降，張故校長之公子星聯，芝聯，即邀請副校長朱經農及三社主要教職負，集議着手復校，公推朱副校長代理校長，在證券大樓正式復校，按期開學。校董會重行組織，公推翁文灝爲董事長，由校董會議決將捐諸川人之分校，仍還歸川人，更名爲「成華大學」，並聘朱經農廖茂如分任大中學校長。一面又請准教育部，將虹口歐陽路二二一與二二二號之敵產撥交校舍，遷入上課。朱校長並辭教部次長職，到校正式視事。</p>
<p>院系主任　現該校各院系主任敎授如下：文學院院長兼中國文學系主任蔣竹莊，外國語文系主任周煦良，教育糸主任孫貴定，歷史系主任呂思勉，法律系主任郭雲觀，政治系主任耿淡如，社會系主任胡祖蔭。理學院院長容啓兆，化學系主任沈昭文，生物學系主任王志稼，（名譽教授秉農山）數理系主任朱公謹，土木工程學系主任祝永年。商學院院長岑德彰，經濟學系主任唐慶增，會計學系主任薛迪符，銀行學系主任何儀朝，工商管理學系主任蔡正稚。</p>

<h3>學費論米計值？</h3>
<p>— 平齋</p>
<p>在今天，法幣幣　的低落已經是一件無庸諱言的事實。但是，無論法幣的價値跌到如何程度，它總是我國唯一的合法的通貨。因之，雖然上海灘上多的是良心漆黑專想以金條美鈔計算房租的二房東，倒底他們還不敢在光天化日之下，公然說他不要法幣而要法幣以外的別的東西。</p>
<p>使用金鈔旣泣禁例，以「白米」爲單位又豈能視爲合法！</p>
<p>然而，近來不斷的在謠傳着某幾個大學下學期的學費要五担米，某幾個中學要三担米……之類的消息。前幾天，果然有一個某大學的高級負責人，親口向新聞記者表示，下學期的學費要論米計値了，他說要什麼中熟米五担云云，話是說得相當肯定的，儼然是勢在必行的樣子。</p>
<p>如果學生寄宿在校，要在學校裏吃飯，學校裘在目前這種特殊環境之下，要學生把戶口米的配售證交給學校，由學校每月向學生照戶口米的議價收費，買來的米就給學生吃，這樣辦倒還比較說得通。但是，若學雜費都要論米計値，則家長之能否負担姑且不論，試問這對其他各業可能產生什麼影響？如果政府准許學校以法幣以外的東西爲收費標準，那未谷業羣起效尤起來又怎麼辦？　如說，將來醫生出診一次要中熟米二斗，布店裏賣布時又每尺要中熟米幾升……之類，政府又能不能再說他們違法呢？到了那個時候，二房東收房租的時候如果要以米幾斗或幾担計算，是否尚在禁止之列？</p>
<p>當然，目前各學校的教師生活確已極端淸苦，我們是極表同情的。平心而論，學費也確是應當增加。不過，論米計値却是一儸萬不可開的惡例，此事流風所及，足以立置法幣於死地。事關國家根本，爲人師者，尚請三思！</p>
<h3>動物的語言</h3>
<p>— 國平</p>
<p>動物也有牠們的語言。許多動物的「談話」是用一種像電碼一樣的東西，也有許多動物以姿態或動作來表明牠們心中所要說的話。</p>
<p>當一隻工蜂找到了一朶充滿了蜜的花後，她便急速地飛回到蜂房，開始在房的中央作迥旋式的舞　，高興地報告着好消息。這樣的舞蹈便像言語樣地告訴了其餘的工蜂，於是牠們便排了隊，興冲冲地飛到那花叢中去採蜜了。</p>
<p>兔子得到了驚惶的消息後，便到其他的兔子前，用牠的後脚在地上拼命地重擊，來告訴他們。</p>
<p>動物學家已證明，當一隻雄狼獲得到許多食物而吃不盡時，牠便把餘下的食物埋在土中，當牠嗅着這泥土時，便留下了特殊的氣味，其餘的狼便可以藉此臭味而找到食物，這臭味便代替了語言。</p>
<p>一隻雄的畸形蟹向異性的求愛的方法頗如人類；當牠遇到一隻雌蟹時，牠便舉起大鉗揮搖，表示招呼。如果雌蟹走近牠，牠便用趾尖跳起舞來，更用大鉗做出許多不同種形式來示意。</p>
<p>蜂烏和異性談話的表現是頗有詩意的。當一隻雄的蜂島見到異性時，牠便振翅迴旋，在她面前作圓弧形的飛舞。常雌的蜂烏稍示注意時，雄島便開始熱情起來，愈飛愈高。最後，牠一嗚衝夭，而飛到六十呎高度處，又驟然降落，又在雌蜂烏面前飛舞，以博實賞。</p>
<p>在熱帶有一種樓樹蟻，牠們在此樹與彼樹間的「談話」是藉在抑幹上叩擊的聲音的快慢和强弱來示意的，雖然螞蟻的脚聲輕微得人耳不能聽到，但牠們自己却可以互相聽到。</p>
<p>效是用耳朶的捲動來一說話」的。</p>
<p>我們可以說，一切動物的語言脫不掉用動作，臭味，或人耳不可聞的微聲幾種方法。有的動物學家相信這就是所謂「傳心術」（Telepathy），但有的專家以爲人類的五官太遲鈍，所以聽不見牠們的「語」聲罷了，孰是孰非，要待以後科學的證明。</p>
<h3>「我兄」與「仁兄」</h3>
<p>— 尢墨君</p>
<p>「我兄」與「仁兄」是函札中常恥和常見的稱謂。二者用法略有別：比較客氣些的應稱「仁兄」；反之，如果較親近些的，則多稱「我兄」。現在所要討論的是「我兄」二字的寫法。按我國書寫法中有所謂「跳出」者，卽俗稱「抬頭」，所以表敬意。「兄」係敬詞，故當跳出寫，自無疑義；惟現在咨寫　將「我」字與「兄」字拆開，卽「我」字不須抬頭，此點頗可商榷。</p>
<p>唐懷仁集右軍聖教序與歐陽詢醴泉銘同爲我們臨池所常用之帖。聖教序中「我皇福臻一句，「我」字跳出寫；醴泉銘中「我后固懷撝挹」及「我后夕惕」句，二「我」字亦都抬頭寫。推「我」字所以跳出書寫之故，因這係親戴之詞，並非臣下自謂；於推尊之中，寫有親愛之意，寫法極合。今人書信中稱起「我兄」，硬生生將「我」字拆開，習焉而不知其誤，只好說與「占」不合了！</p>
<p>「仁兄」之稱，倒着實「古」。後漢書趙壹傳載　答皇甫規書中有「實望仁兄，昭其懸遲」之句，是漢時已有此稱呼了。</p>
<h3>古意</h3>
<p>— 畢</p>
<p>君家吳江頭，妾住金陵郭，長憶江南遊，且　　　樂。</p>
<p>江南可採連，導井紅灼灼，採連不採　，葉是鴛鴦幕。</p>
<p>幕上秋風生，露下靑枝落，枝落絲仍連，人去心相託。</p>
<p>相託江水長，相送風波惡，一語持贈君，心苦難爲藥！</p>
<p>其二</p>
<p>悠悠白雲馳，黯黯飛烏度，島過猶遺音，雲去不相顧。</p>
<p>相顧亦難見，相見在夢寐，密雨下成川，中有夢中淚。</p>
<p>淚盡復如何！血滴堦下土。取土範作盤，作君胭脂府。</p>
<p>朝看兩頰紅，暮若兩頰赤，朝朝與暮暮，只見好顏色。</p>
<h3>「搶位子」</h3>
<p>— 翼君</p>
<p>在學校裏的各種交誼會上做過許多次遊戯，「搶位子」就是其叩之一種。這種遊戯的做法是：把座位排成一圓圈形，假定參加人數是二十人，位子數目便祗有十九個或十八個。哨子一吹，所有的人都離　位子，哨子再一吹，大家便各自搶一個位子坐，結果，當然一定有一個或二個人搶不到位子的。</p>
<p>現在社會上的求職現象，簡直同「搶位子」的遊戯是一個樣子。社會上的「位子」有限得很，早已佔得滿滿的，旁邊倒還有好多人守候着；學校裏的畢業生出來了，東奔西走，弄得氣急敗壞，碰得頭破血流，要想搶到一個空位子，那就非有天大的本領不可，所以大多數人都得不到位子。</p>
<p>「搶位子」的遊戯，畢竟是遊戯；搶不到，站一下就是了。再苛刻一點，不過罰唱一支歌，或是說一個笑話，使得「皆大歡喜」，倒是一件樂事。而求職時的「搶位子」可就不是好玩的，位子搶不到，就要罰你表演「做楊妹一，使得你仰不足以事父母，俯不足以蓄妻子，爲親者所痛，爲仇者所快。</p>
<p>「搶位子」的遊戲，不足的位子只有一個，頂多兩個，所以搶不到的是少數一兩個人；而求職時，不足的位子太多了，空的位子少得可憐，所以搶不到位子的是多數，而且是大多數。「搶位子」的遊戲，人數不增多，而「搶位子」式的求職，則人數一年年大批大批的增加，　等位子越少，新的敵手越增多，越難搶到。</p>
<p>有時你託人介紹工作，他說：「等機會吧！」意思就是：等空位子吧！但是等這個位子空的固不止你一人，所以縱　天帮忙，你們所且夕守候着的一個位子空出來了，你們之中，也只能有一人搶得到，其餘的人勢必還是白等。更糟的是，甚至爲你們所守候着的位子根本不空，那就　也搶不到。我從靜安寺乘電車到北四川路底，就有過好幾次這樣的經騐：上電車時，沒有搶到位子，便守住一個坐着人的位子，準備他中途下車時取而代之，但中途經過多少站，左右四隣都有位子空出爲他人搶去，偏偏獨有我所守候着的位子，其人固守座位不動，直到北四川路底，方始下來。結果，我就白等了一塲。求職時，也正有這同樣的情形，但危險性卻是更大。</p>
<p>「搶位子」，在遊戯的塲合，是搶空位子而已，搶不到，也就作罷論。但在求職的塲合，便沒這簡單了，在搶的時候，固然不免惡鬥一塲，搶過之後，搶不到的人，他們也許就要擠那些本來「有人的位子」，於是擠人者與被人擠者，勢必打做一團，扭成一堆，大戰起來，殘害起來，而演成所謂「人禍」。</p>
<p>今日社會上有兩大問題：一是物價問題，一是「位子」問題；等到物價不漲，位子不搶的時候，大槪也就沒有什麼了不得的問題了。</p>
<h3>聯語雜談</h3>
<p>— 健秋</p>
<p>聯語之作，或以雄偉勝，或以纖麗勝。雖取徑不同，要不可偏廢，茲錄數則，以實本談。</p>
<p>韓國鈞先生哭其次公子聯云：「自輕其生，以貽親愛，是謂不孝；旣哭汝兄，又見汝死，我何家爲。」一字一淚，令人不忍卒讀。蓋公子肥馬輕裘，縱情聲色，一夕不戒於酒，墮樓而死。紫老哭之慟，至情流露，故不自覺其悲苦耳。</p>
<p>揚州平山堂有謁某集宋人文一聯云：「　遠山，吞長江，（范仲淹）在西南諸峯，林壑尤美；（歐腸修）送夕陽，迎素月，（王禹　）當春夏之交，草木際天。（蘇軾）」信手拈來，夭衣無縫。所謂裘綴千腋，滅盡綫迹，洵佳構也。</p>
<p>西湖平湖秋月聯云：「穿　而來，夏日淸風冬日日；捲　相見，前山明月後山山」。故爲重疊，而不覺其　，亦見慧思。</p>
<h3>從嚴培興案想起的故事</h3>
<p>— 調鸚</p>
<p>嚴培興案已忽然變得無聲無具，倒底他是不是瘋子，大家也莫名其妙。美國某雜誌中紀載一段事情，倒和嚴案有些相像：</p>
<p>美國有一言商，年事已高，却娶了一位年輕貌美的太太。這位富商頗疑太太不貞，但她矢口否認。有一天，那位富商因公事極忙，回家時已疲倦不堪，不想那位太太却帶了一個醫生進來，硬說他身體不好，要他騐血，醫生一動手術，那位富商便昏迷了過法。</p>
<p>他醒來時已在一家私家瘋人院中，不准接見來客，他爭吵着要出去，院方一槪置之不理。一連關了二十七個月！</p>
<p>但那富商的一位姪子却動了疑心，他請了一個律師，到瘋人院去，要求見一見那位當商。不想一連走了五十多次，竟然無法見到。那位律師義愪塡膺，他就去請一位政界的要人帮忙，不想那位要人去時，醫院還是不理。最後，他們拿了法院的傳票去「傳一那個「瘋人『，才總算會到——當然，那位「瘋人」不過在那天被打了一針麻醉針，何嘗有什麼瘋病！</p>
<p>結果查出來那位瘋人院的主持人和醫生都曾受賄，那位富商的妻子自然用心已昭然芳揭，於是都判了應得之罪。這一類的犯罪案件居然相當的多，判罪時往往倒是那位醫生的罪最重（因爲他硬把好好的人說是有神經病），處罰金有超過一萬美元者。</p>
<h3>兩廣</h3>
<p>— 公孫午</p>

<h3>The Flames of War Spread Along the Pingbao Line: Qingye Policies Implemented in Dingxing, Laishui, and Xincheng, Fortified Baoyuan Defenses, and Peace Maintained in the Suburbs</h3>
<p>[Our Baoding Dispatch, 17th] The flames of war spread along the Pingbao Line. Battle reports arrived from various strongholds along the Baoding-Zhuoxian line. Dingxing City faced continuous wave-like attacks by bandits until the evening of the 16th. On the morning of the 17th, after 6:00 AM, communication between the defending troops under Commander Chen Zhiping and Pingbao was cut off. Aerial reconnaissance this afternoon reported a chaotic situation in the city. The main forces of the bandit's 2nd and 6th Columns were moving north and south, with a portion looting supplies stockpiled at military stations for transport to Pingbao. Moreover, the bandit's 1st Column and Ma's troops repeatedly attacked the outskirts of Gaobeidian, Fangshan, and Zhuoxian without success.</p>
<p>[Our Beiping Dispatch, 17th] A major battle looms on the northern section of the Pinghan Railway. The North China Suppression General Headquarters announces that at least three bandit columns have been discovered on the northern section of the Pinghan Railway. In order to concentrate forces and proactively engage the enemy, Qingye policies are being implemented in Laishui (west of the railway, on the Pingbao Line) and Xincheng (east of the railway, where Commissioner Wang Fenggang is stationed).</p>
<p>[Our Baoding Dispatch, 17th] Military sources report that the focus of the Pingbao Line fighting has concentrated on Beihe Store, Gucheng Town, and Caohe Bridge. The defending troops in Beihe and Gucheng are under siege by the 2nd, 4th, 6th, and 3rd Columns. National forces fought back day and night, with joint land and air counterattacks causing heavy bandit casualties. As of 1:00 PM on the 17th, the large iron bridge at Beihe remained intact. The struggle has reached a fever pitch, with national forces engaged in fierce combat. Additionally, bandits probed and harassed the outskirts of Xushui on the morning of the 17th. As of 2:00 PM in the afternoon, the battle had not yet begun, but a defensive war is inevitable. At 11:00 AM on the 17th, Caohe Bridge was under heavy attack by the bandit's 7th Column, and close-quarters combat with the defending troops has begun. Tanks and armored vehicles from Baoyuan are rapidly moving north to assist in the battle and launch a full-scale counterattack. Yesterday's reports of Caohe's fall were inaccurate; the suburbs of Baoyuan remain peaceful.</p>
<p>[Our Beiping Dispatch, 17th] A spokesperson for the North China Suppression General Headquarters stated that the fighting on the Pingbao Line may not be the full extent of the communist bandits' actions. In addition to the current operations, they may be planning another significant military adventure, which the military is closely monitoring. The Suppression General Headquarters also released a battle report stating that the strongholds of Zhoukoudian and Jiyang Village, west of Liangxiang, fell to the bandits on the morning of the 16th, and fierce fighting is underway in the suburbs of Fangshan. Bandits attacking northwest of Changxindian engaged in fierce fighting in Dongxiwangzuo and Niutouzhuang on the night of the 15th. Reinforcements arrived by 2:00 AM this morning, and by 5:00 AM, the bandits retreated towards Tuoli.</p>
<p>[Another Dispatch] The Suppression General Headquarters announced: (1) Bandits attacking Dingxing launched a fierce all-night assault on the city, breaching the north and south walls in two places. Aerial reconnaissance at 5:00 AM this morning reported the fiercest fighting at the north and south passes, with defending troops still holding the city walls and fortifications. (2) Aerial reconnaissance at 9:00 AM this morning reported small groups of bandits harassing Caohe, Gucheng, Beihe Store, and Gaobeidian north of Baoding. Bandits in the Saidian and Liulihe areas were pushed west of the railway by national forces. (3) Bandits harassing Fangshan launched a fierce all-night assault on the city walls. The fighting was intense, but the bandits were repelled by 7:00 AM this morning and are now building fortifications in the suburbs.</p>
<p>[Our Baoding Dispatch, 17th] After full contact along the Pingbao Line, the North China Suppression General Headquarters issued operational instructions to the local military authorities on the 16th. The current communist bandit strategy appears to be "big fish eat small fish," seizing small national army strongholds. Moreover, with Baoyuan's defenses fortified, any reckless attack by the communist bandits would be extremely difficult.</p>
<h3>The Battle to Defend Xiangyang Reaches its Climax</h3>
<p>[Our Hankou Dispatch, 17th] The hard-fought battle to defend Xiangyang, which has lasted for weeks, has reached its climax. Yesterday, bandit troops launched repeated night assaults, resulting in exceptionally fierce fighting. Some strongholds in the suburbs have been seized by the bandits, and national forces are currently relying on city defense fortifications to continue blocking and repelling them. Furthermore, local air forces again launched a full-scale sortie this morning to assist in the fighting around the city, continuing until 7:00 PM. Military sources report that the bandits besieging Xiangyang once broke into the urban area from the southwest gate but were routed after being blocked and suppressed by the defending troops. The fighting in the suburbs is still raging fiercely.</p>
<p>[Our Xi'an Dispatch, 17th] The battle for Xiangyang is extremely fierce. Bandits are launching all-out attacks on the city gates. A small group once broke in but was completely annihilated by national forces. As of last night, the 16th, communication between Xiangyang and this location remained open.</p>
<h3>National Forces in Western Shandong Recapture Important Strongholds, All Huanghe River Crossings Recovered, Bandit Army Cut Off from Retreat Turns South and Crosses Longhai Railroad.</h3>
<p>[Our Xuzhou Dispatch, 17th] The crack troops of the National Army in Western Shandong yesterday successively recovered important strongholds such as Hongchuankou, Linpuji, and Dongkou. As a result, all Huanghe River crossings on the south bank of the Huanghe River have been occupied by the National Army. The retreat route and supply lines of the remaining bandits in the area south of the Huanghe River have been completely cut off. The remnants of the bandit Chen's 3rd, 4th, 8th, and 11th Columns in Western Shandong turned around and fled south. Yesterday, they crossed the Longhai Railway near Dangshan and fled south. The National Army is currently pursuing and suppressing them. The Huanghai air group today repeatedly bombed the bandits between Dangshan and Yucheng and on both sides of the Longhai Railway, killing more than 300 bandits and destroying more than 20 wagons. [Our Jinan Dispatch, 17th] A crack unit of the National Army that went north from the Dingtao area of southwestern Shandong has now advanced to the vicinity of Jining and Yanzhou. In addition to the panic of the remaining bandits, the Huanghe River crossings were blockaded by the air force. As a result, in addition to the rapid Second Column of Liangguang fleeing towards Wenxue across the Wen River, the remaining 3rd, 8th, and 1st Columns and Liu's 11th Column turned south again and fled to the vicinity of Dangshan and Lanfeng. The National Army continued to encircle and suppress them. In addition, the three regiments, 17, 19, and 21, of Zhang Guangzhong's bandit troops who attacked Lincheng have been repelled by the National Army.</p>
<h3>Wanxi Local Militia Recovers Zhenping</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Kaifeng, 17th] Under the support of the National Army, the Wanxi local militia has begun a heroic campaign to wipe out bandits and save the homeland. On the 12th, they captured Zhenping in one fell swoop, defeating the new 1st and 2nd Brigades of the Chen Geng bandit troops, and are now cleaning up the remaining bandits in the suburbs. Another powerful local militia simultaneously recovered Liqingdian, an important town west of Nanzhao, cutting off the bandit's important communication lines in the Funiu Mountains.</p>
<p>Bandits Capture Guantang and Zhangmao, etc.</p>
<h3>War Situation in Western Henan Tightens</h3>
<p>Bandits Capture Guantang and Zhangmao, etc.</p>
<p>[Our Xi'an Dispatch, 17th] The war situation in western Henan is tightening. Xiashi, Guanyintang, and Zhangmao have been captured by bandits. Three bandit brigades are currently engaged in fierce fighting with local militia at Weijialing, east of Shaanxi. In addition, powerful units of the National Army in Bin County, Shaanxi Province, crossed the Jing River and advanced towards Gouyi. The main force of the "Guanzhong Garrison Brigade" that was originally based in Tuqiao has fled east to the vicinity of Liulinmiaowan.</p>
<h3>National Army Airdropped to Taiyuan in Aid of Shanxi</h3>
<p>Fighting Moves North, Sound of Artillery Heard</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Taiyuan, 17th] The first batch of National Army reinforcements for Shanxi arrived in Taiyuan by air at 10:40 AM on the 17th. After the National Army disembarked, women and student representatives waved red and green flags to cheer the soldiers who had come from afar to suppress the bandits, and expressed their respect on behalf of all the city's people. Powerful National Army units will be transported to Taiyuan in a steady stream.</p>
<p>[Another Dispatch] After the fighting in the Yuci, Taiyuan, and Xuzhou triangle came to an end, the center of the fighting has gradually shifted north towards the suburbs of Taiyuan. Yesterday evening, communist bandits took advantage of the opportunity to flee north to Nanyan Xiaowuyu, about 30 li southwest of Taiyuan City. The bandits were repelled by the National Army on the morning of the 17th, suffering heavy casualties. The sound of artillery thundered this morning, clearly audible in Taiyuan City, but the people's hearts remained as stable as ever.</p>
<p>[Our Taiyuan Dispatch, 16th] On the 16th, Tang Shuyu's fiefdom, 40 li southwest of Taiyuan and a scenic spot in Shanxi, was captured by bandits fleeing north from Qingyuan. The Shanxi war situation has reached a turning point, but the bandits are still reinforcing. It is reported that the bandit's Third Column has arrived in Shouyang from Shijiazhuang and will participate in the battle. The main battle in the Yuci, Taigu, Qixian, and Jiaocheng areas has lasted for ten days. The fighting became more intense from the night of the 15th to the morning of the 16th. A unit of the National Army successively captured Xichang, Xibian, Xiuwen, and other important villages south of Yuci on the 16th. On the night of the 15th, bandits attacked Beichangdi near Huangzhai again, launching 19 fierce attacks, suffering more than 400 casualties, and retreated to Xihuangshui at dawn on the 16th. These bandits, numbering five or six regiments, were transferred from the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia area.</p>

<p>[Our Xuzhou Dispatch, 17th] Commander Li Yutang, who had bravely defended Chuzhou for 25 days and nights, safely arrived in Xuzhou on the morning of the 17th after breaking through the encirclement on the afternoon of the 13th.</p>

<h3>Foreign Correspondents Report on North China Government Observations: Will the CCP Split? Encouraged by Southern States' Resistance to the Cominform, CCP Within the Passes May Break Away From Mao Zedong's Faction</h3>
<p>[Chung Sheh, Local Dispatch] Certain North China government circles recently believed that it is very possible that the CCP south of the Great Wall will automatically break away from the CCP that is aligned with the pro-Cominform faction. They also believe that the Soviet Union will abandon the CCP, just as it abandoned Yugoslavia, if they believe that the Chinese reds are no longer of any benefit to global communism. On the other hand, an agency told the Associated Press that they have reason to believe that if Yugoslavia's resistance to the Cominform and the courage of nations to continue their independent nationalism is successful, the CCP south of the Great Wall may split from the communists of the northeast. Their theory is that after being encouraged by the success of the South's resistance to global communism, the communists within China Proper may split from Mao Zedong and his Central Committee and attempt to establish a coalition government with the National Government. This action, even if considered or accepted by the National Government, does not mean abandoning the northeast to Mao Zedong and his Cominform communists. On the contrary, the internal strife within China Proper will end, and all efforts will be devoted to the war to recover the northeast. However, it cannot be ignored that after this series of events occurs, there will inevitably be conflict with the Soviet Union. According to those who made this statement, they have facts that can prove their views.</p>
<h3>Spokesperson of the Ministry of Interior Clarifies the Publication Law, Responds to Comments From the Press</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 17th] A spokesperson for the Ministry of Interior stated: After the Nanjing Xinmin Bao ceased publication, press commentators stated that some believed that the government's decision to suspend the newspaper, based on the protection of the interests of the nation and the people, was reasonable and lawful. Others expressed regret that the government's measures exceeded the degree of reason and law. Some even expressed doubts about the law on which it was based. Here are some clarifications regarding the latter's comments: (1) If a newspaper's illegal record is a first offense and the circumstances are minor, a warning may be given leniently in accordance with Article 28, Paragraph 2 of the Publication Law. However, the newspaper in question has been repeatedly warned for illegal publications over the years and has not shown any repentance. Recently, it has intensified its efforts, openly attempting to harm national interests and disrupt public order. The circumstances are serious and fully constitute the punitive conditions stipulated in Article 28, Paragraph 1 of the same law, forcing the government to take the final measure. Some press commentary suspects that the government neglected to warn the newspaper and abruptly imposed a permanent suspension, which is a misunderstanding. However, some comments believe that the government's punishment of the newspaper this time was too late, which further proves the government's tolerance and painstaking efforts. (2) Some say that the provision has lost its integrity and cannot be used to bind the obligated person. However, the "intention to subvert the National Government or harm the interests of the Republic of China" prohibited by the provision already includes two meanings, and each has its independence in application. The effect of the prohibition cannot be affected by the change in the first half of the fact. The so-called loss of integrity is obviously a misunderstanding. (3) Although Article 11 of the Constitution stipulates that people have the freedom of speech, lecturing, writing, and publication, in accordance with Article 23 "The freedoms listed in the above articles may not be restricted by law except when necessary to prevent obstruction of the freedom of others, to avoid emergencies, to maintain social order, or to promote the public interest," the government's legal restriction of the freedoms enjoyed by the people within the necessary scope stipulated in this article is not prohibited by the Constitution. Although the current Publication Law was promulgated before the implementation of the Constitution, the government's crackdown on newspapers that endanger national and social security based on the necessary scope recognized by the Constitution does not violate the Constitution in the slightest. It is regrettable that a small number of people in the press are ignorant of this. (4) When we study the history of the freedom and restriction of publication, we must understand that the modern publication management system in various countries is due to the progress of printing technology and the contradictions that have arisen in the publishing industry. It is necessary to have this law to regulate the freedom of individuals to publish and protect the interests of the public as a whole. We cannot misunderstand that the current Publication Law formulated by the National Government is a product of the Beijing government era because China once promulgated the Publication Law and Newspaper Regulations in 1914, thereby denying its existence value. Looking at the Charter of Human Rights formulated by the recent United Nations Conference on Freedom of the Press, it has revealed that the freedom of expression has its relative obligations and responsibilities. And it lists violations of national security secrets or incitement of people to use riots to change the government, etc., which should be subject to legal sanctions. It can be seen that the state has given legal boundaries to this freedom. Also, such as the United Kingdom and the United States, which are known for their democratic freedoms, the crackdown on publications is also scattered in various laws and regulations and is not without restrictions. Our legislative system has always belonged to the continental law system, so the management of publications has special laws. It is difficult to equate it with the country that adopts scattered provisions in the Anglo-American marine law system. A small number of newspapers criticized the Publication Law as an unnecessary branch law other than the criminal law, which is probably not deeply understood. In short, the law is a model for the people and the government to jointly abide by. Restricting the people is exactly to restrict the government. If the people can exercise their freedom of publication within the scope of the law, the government cannot interfere outside the law. Therefore, the most democratic freedom of publication is established on the basis of the rule of law. It is hoped that the national press will cooperate in the spirit of the rule of law for the freedom of publication, which is very fortunate.</p>
<h3>Control Yuan Discusses the Treaty of Peace with Japan, Committee Members Speak Enthusiastically, No Conclusion Reached, Discussion Will Resume at the Next Meeting</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 17th] The Control Yuan held its 20th meeting on the 17th, chaired by Yu Youren. After the report items were completed, it proceeded to discuss the "Proposal to Request the Government to Expedite the Treaty of Peace with Japan" submitted by Xun Zhan Guan and others. No conclusion was reached, and it was decided to discuss it in the first meeting on the morning of the 19th. The case was also attached with the opinions of the Review Committee as follows: 1. After the investigation, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has neither taken the initiative in the Treaty of Peace with Japan, nor can it strive for good strategies to break the international deadlock. According to the provisions of Article 97 of the Constitution, it should be corrected to urge it to pay attention to improvement. The Chairman of the Examination Committee, Hu Yiwenhui, also reported on the examination process and its results, followed by enthusiastic speeches by various committee members. Xing Senzhou spoke first, believing that a vote should be taken. Qiu Nianhe, a Control Committee member from the same province, said: Failure to take the initiative in the Treaty of Peace is also a fact, and the correction proposal can be submitted immediately. Quan Shaowen said: From the standpoint of national diplomacy, something should be expressed, but international relations are a technical issue and can be handled by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Chen Zhiming believed that the actual situation of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs should be studied first. Huang Baoshi said: The international deadlock is not limited to the Treaty of Peace with Japan, and whether it is necessary to start with the review should be discussed further. Wang Guanwu said: There is no concrete proof of the facts in the content of this case, and the Undersecretary of Foreign Affairs, Ye Gongchao, has already issued a statement in response to reality, so if we conduct an investigation and the facts are true, the correction case is not enough, and even if it is a correction case, a censure case should also be handled. Then the original proposer, Zou Lu, explained that the power of investigation of the Control Committee members is based on the provisions of Article 24 of the Rules of Procedure, which is to "obtain" an investigation, so an investigation is not necessary. At that time, some people proposed that the foreign affairs issue should not be limited to the Treaty of Peace with Japan, and that the protection of overseas Chinese rights should be added and included in the investigation, but when it was submitted for a vote, one was based on the opinions of several people and was intended to be approved in principle. The preliminary investigation will then be submitted to the General Assembly for discussion, but after the vote, only 38 of the 104 people in the room agreed, and it was rejected by a minority. Secondly, the review opinion was put to a vote, and 46 people agreed, which was also a minority and could not be passed, and it was decided to hand it over to the next meeting (19th) for discussion (Note: The full text of the case has been published in this newspaper on July 1).</p>
<h3>Merger of the Direct Tax Bureau and the Commodity Tax Bureau</h3>
<p>National Tax Bureaus Established in Various Provinces, Merger of the Direct and Commodity Tax Bureaus in Directly-Administered Municipalities Temporarily Postponed</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 17th] After the establishment of the National Tax Administration, the Direct Tax Bureau and the Commodity Tax Bureau of each province will also be merged to establish the National Tax Administration Bureau. The candidates for the directors of each provincial bureau have also been internally determined. The merger measures are being actively drafted and will soon be announced by the Ministry of Finance. However, the merger of the Direct and Commodity Tax Bureaus in directly-administered municipalities such as Shanghai, Guangzhou, Chongqing, Tianjin, Qingdao, and Hankou will be temporarily postponed. In addition, the organization of the National Tax Administration has been approved by the Political Affairs Conference. It is divided into five departments. The first department is in charge of direct taxes, the second department is in charge of commodity taxes, and the third, fourth, and fifth departments are in charge of personnel, general affairs, and accounting.</p>
<p>Remarks by Jiang Shuge</p>
<p>Jiang Shuge, the newly appointed Director of the National Tax Administration, told reporters on the afternoon of the 17th: He was ordered to serve as Director of the National Tax Administration, and he is now busy arranging personnel and merging institutions. He has not yet put forward a concrete business plan, but it can be said that the merger of the Tax Affairs Administration and the Direct Tax Administration is of great significance. It can be divided into five points: (1) Simplify the organization, (2) Facilitate tax collection, (3) Strengthen administrative efficiency, (4) Increase tax revenue, and (5) Save expenses. The most important thing is to simplify the organization and facilitate tax collection. According to Jiang, there are about 1,100 branches of the Direct Tax Administration Commodity Tax Administration across the country. After the merger, about 600 units can be reduced. The merger is currently underway and will be completed as soon as possible. Before the institutions in various places are merged, the tax collection business will continue separately. After the institutions are merged, the various tax items will not change, but they will only be collected by a unified institution. In the past, there were often two institutions in one place, and taxpayers did not know where to pay, but this can be avoided in the future.</p>

<h3>The Legislative Yuan Holds its 21st Meeting: The Examination Law Passes Third Reading; the Tax Exemption for Grain Businesses is Rejected; the General Budget to Undergo Final Review at Today's Joint Session</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 17th] The Legislative Yuan held its 21st meeting on the morning of the 17th, chaired by Sun Ke. The meeting continued to address the unfinished agenda items from the 20th meeting on the 16th. First, the Examination Law passed its third reading (full text in yesterday's edition of this newspaper). After minor textual revisions, the discussion turned to the proposal by Luo Qinghua and others to amend Article 2, Section 7 of the Business Tax Law to include businesses dealing in rice and miscellaneous grains in the tax-exempt category, as reported by the Finance and Economic Committee. The committee convener, Liu Zhendong, explained the committee's review opinion, arguing against tax exemptions for rice and miscellaneous grain businesses and asserting that no amendments to the Business Tax Law were necessary. The reasons cited were that tax exemptions would not stabilize grain prices, and that rice and grain business taxes were local revenue, with varying regulations across regions. The Legislative Yuan should not disregard the opinions of local public opinion bodies and rashly grant full exemptions, especially since the state was increasing various taxes to balance revenue and expenditure. The rice and grain business tax should not be uniquely exempted. Subsequently, a few committee members defended the original proposal, citing insufficient review and requesting a re-review. However, criticisms of grain merchants arose one after another. President Sun put the motion for re-review to a vote. Out of 278 members present, only 13 voted in favor. This was met with mocking applause, a first for the Legislative Yuan. The review opinion was finally passed, meaning that the rice and miscellaneous grain business tax would not be exempted. Following this, the meeting discussed the Grain Administration Committee's report and the results of reviewing three proposals related to grain administration by Sun Xiangfeng and others, Liu Yunzhao and others, and Qu Zhisheng and others. The proposal by Qu Zhisheng to establish a grain storage system was deemed insufficiently reviewed and was returned to the Grain Administration Committee to be re-reviewed in conjunction with the Finance and Economic Committee. Furthermore, it was resolved to refer the proposal by Wu Wangji and others to draft a Land Rent Reduction Ordinance to improve the lives of tenant farmers and stabilize rural areas to the Land Administration Committee, and the proposal by Jian Guan’san and others to draft an ordinance on the requisitioning and requisition of deposits and assets of Chinese people abroad, along with seven reasons for seeking a public decision, to the Finance and Economic Committee for review. The reports by the Foreign Affairs Committee on the review of the Sino-Burmese border demarcation and the draft organizational regulations of the Investigation Bureau of the Ministry of Judicial Administration were not discussed. The meeting adjourned at 12:30 PM. Due to many committees having scheduled meetings in the afternoon, the meeting was not continued.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 17th] The Budget Committee of the Legislative Yuan has issued a meeting notice, scheduling a joint meeting of all committees of the Yuan for 9:00 AM on the 18th to conduct the final review of the national general budget.

<h3>Two Major Suggestions for the Moral Re-Armament Movement</h3>
<p>— Chen Ruyi</p>
<p>The 10th anniversary of the Moral Re-Armament (MRA) Movement was recently held in the United States. Two hundred delegates from twenty-four countries attended, discussing how to use the power of morality to address world problems. The conference was divided into two stages: the first stage, from the opening on June 3rd to the 7th, was held in Hollywood, Los Angeles; the second stage, from June 8th, was held in Riverside, California, and concluded on the 14th. The joint statement issued at the closing stated, "The war being waged in the world today is fundamentally a war of ideas. Therefore, a democratic life based on individual freedom and human dignity can only endure and be passed on to future generations through theoretical thought." The conclusion emphasized, "We will strive for the re-armament of morality as the unwavering theory of the people's livelihood, and fight hard in all countries and on the world front." At a time when the world is declining and people's hearts are sinking, this grand event, with the re-armament of morality as its central theme, is like a morning bell, worthy of deep reflection and bringing people infinite hope and expectation.</p>
<p>The members of our Perfect Man Philosophy Research Association, in recent years, have been working with people in the domestic cultural circles to promote the "New Morality Movement," the purpose of which coincides with the MRA movement led by Americans. I originally wanted to compare the contents of the MRA movement and the "New Morality Movement" in terms of their historical background, moral standards, specific propositions, and ideological essence, in order to arouse everyone's attention. However, due to space limitations, I cannot explain in detail. Fortunately, both aim to change the world and rebuild world morality, so that people all over the world can move towards the realm of perfection. Therefore, I would like to express my sincerity and put forward two major suggestions for the future of world moral construction for the study of the world:</p>
<p>First, periodically convene an "International Moral Conference." Historically, international moral conferences were held twice in London and the Netherlands in 1912 and 1914 respectively; but since the war, there has been no news. Because everyone does not value righteousness between countries, treaties are equivalent to waste paper, and peace loses its guarantee. In order to maintain world peace and promote human happiness, a large-scale international moral conference should be convened regularly, so that all countries in the world can participate. The Perfect Man Association made a suggestion in this regard at its annual meeting on April 12 last year. Later, the Ministry of Social Affairs replied on June 7 last year: "After consulting with the relevant agencies, we will re-examine it." On November 18 last year, the World Moral Association held the first plenary meeting of member representatives after the victory in Beiping, and also resolved to respond and unanimously advocated. On March 14 this year, the United Nations China Association held a member conference in Beijing. I proposed to the conference that the United Nations should convene an international moral conference regularly; and it would be most appropriate to hold it in China on August 27, 1950, the 2,500th anniversary of the birth of Confucius. The meeting place can be in the capital or in Hangzhou, both are acceptable. If the domestic situation is relatively stable at that time, it would be even more meaningful to hold it in Qufu, Shandong, the birthplace of Confucius. The conference resolved to submit it to the joint meeting of directors and supervisors for discussion. Recently, I received a letter from the United Nations China Association on June 12, stating: "After the first joint meeting of the directors and supervisors of this session, the MRA conference has been held in the United States, and Director Chen Lifu of this association went to attend, this case is reserved." Although the 10th anniversary of the MRA movement is an international gathering, its essence is similar to the annual meeting of an academic group, and it is based on Christianity. Although there are 200 representatives from 24 countries, it is actually less than half of all countries in the world, and its resolutions are not binding. It is obviously not enough to replace a formal international moral conference. I believe that China and the United States, in the eastern and western hemispheres, bear the greatest moral responsibility; this matter can be discussed by the governments of China and the United States, and jointly sought the consent of other countries. Recently, our country's leaders intend to invite the leaders of the MRA movement to visit China and participate in the Confucius Memorial Ceremony. The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization may also hold a conference in China in 1950 at the suggestion of the Chinese Committee. If an international moral conference can be held in a timely manner, it would be a win-win situation. There are only two years left before the scheduled meeting, and the various preparatory work should be started as soon as possible in order to cope with that great scene.</p>
<p>Second, formulate a "Human Moral Charter." Since the signing of the United Nations Charter in 1945, the World Education Charter and the World Human Rights Charter have been produced, all of which are milestones in human progress. We believe that in terms of morality, mankind should also sign a similar charter, as a guideline for behavior. The Perfect Man Association resolved to compile a "Moral Paradigm" at its annual meeting on April 2 last year, the content of which is divided into general terms and categories of various fields, such as political morality, business morality, lawyer morality, doctor morality, writing morality, marriage morality, etc. Because this matter is of great importance and involves too much, it is still in the process of collecting information and sorting it out. Moreover, the ideal personality among the various ethnic groups in the world is not the same. For example, Britain values "gentlemen," the Soviet Union worships "heroes," Germany admires "supermen," and other countries have different goals. We believe that the model of mankind should be "perfect man" as the common highest ideal. The scope of our so-called "Human Moral Charter" is broader than the originally planned "Moral Paradigm." It must be the competent authorities and academic groups of various countries, together with experts in various disciplines, to extract the ethical thoughts and good customs of various countries, and provide specific plans separately, and then carefully review them, so as to integrate Chinese and Western cultures and communicate the new and the old. The content of the draft "Human Moral Charter" should be translated into various languages in advance, so that each other can fully exchange opinions, and then the "International Moral Conference" to be held on August 27, 1950 will discuss it in detail and formally pass it. The scheduled meeting period is ten days, at most half a month. Then the representatives of various countries will bring it back to their own countries and, within a few days, after being unanimously accepted by the people of various countries in a solemn manner, carry out the formalities of exchanging texts and signing. It is estimated that on January 1, 1951, all kinds of daily newspapers and periodicals in the world can be solemnly published at the same time, as a common norm for the whole of mankind. Then, the disputes of the national team and the tragedies of mankind will naturally be gradually eliminated invisibly. It is like a milestone in the great era; since the 1950s, the entire human life can therefore enter a new stage. And that "four-way moral conference" has also completed its most solemn and sacred mission! We believe that the establishment of a new moral system is a prerequisite for building a new world order. Our country's ethical philosophy has always been admired by insightful people in the world, and in the future, we should do our best to draft and review the "Human Moral Charter"!</p>
<p>At present, the collapse and disillusionment of the Taoist association has become a recognized fact; therefore, the re-armament and rebirth of morality is the most urgent task at present. Let's not say "the road is one foot high, the devil is one foot high." We believe that the power of justice will surely win the final victory! We must emulate Qu Yuan's noble character and integrity, and change the atmosphere of the times with the spirit of being alone in the world; and take passive retirement as a warning. We must emulate Zhong Kui's righteousness and ambition, and sweep away the dregs of society with the spirit of eradicating evil; and take tolerating traitors as a warning. We know that in the world, good people are often isolated, so they are frustrated. As the saying goes, "If two people are of one mind, their strength can break gold." "An arrow is easy to break, but many arrows are difficult to break." When stripping reaches its limit, it will be restored, and innovation will be carried out; this is the time, and no one else can do it! Only good people can quickly unite to save the current crisis! Zeng Wenzhenggong said: "Where does the thickness of customs come from? It comes from the heart of one or two people." But if you want to change people's hearts, the task is heavy and the road is long, and it is not the strength of one hand or one foot, nor is it the work of one morning or evening. In the future, the promotion of the "New Morality Movement" depends on the people of the world who have lofty ideals and benevolence to rise up and support it, in order to achieve the effect of promoting it widely; and I sincerely hope to cooperate with the leaders of the MRA movement, so as to concentrate our efforts and save the world from collapsing. It is not difficult for the ideal world of the family and the earthly kingdom of Christian doctrine to be realized in the world at the same time. This is the result of moral re-armament, and this is the vision of moral rebirth!</p>
<h3>Song Ziwen Takes Emergency Measures; Martial Law Imposed on Sino-Hong Kong Border; Two Regiments of National Army Deployed for Defense</h3>
<p>[Our Guangzhou Dispatch, 16th] (Arrived) Sha Yuchong on the Sino-Hong Kong border was attacked by bandits on the 15th, following Sha Tau Kok. About 200 bandits attacked Sha Yuchong on the morning of the 15th. A certain battalion of the 154th Brigade of the garrison immediately fought back. After a fierce battle lasting five hours, the bandits repeatedly failed to capture it. Until 12:00 noon, the defending army, unable to receive reinforcements, retreated into Sha Tau Kok led by Battalion Commander Wang Xianzhen. The defending army suffered about 20 casualties, and about 40 soldiers were captured. In addition, about 20 customs officers were captured. Currently, Director Song Ziwen has taken emergency measures on the Sino-Hong Kong border, strictly ordering the defending army and the Huian County Government to strictly enforce martial law. According to people from the border, the area is now in a state of blockade and martial law. Two regiments of the National Army have been deployed in the border area and will launch a campaign to suppress the bandits. According to Hong Kong news, the bandits were commanded by Zeng Sheng, leading more than 2,000 bandits, attempting to sabotage the traffic on the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway. The Commander-in-Chief of the British Army in Southeast Asia visited the New Territories on the 16th. Xie Zhennan, Director of the Political Work Department of the Sui Jing Garrison Headquarters in Guangzhou, told reporters that Sha Yuchong is the Dongjiang channel for Hong Kong people, and also a base for private smugglers. Our customs has checkpoints here. The purpose of the bandits' attack seems to be the customs, because the bandits protect smuggling and levy water fees, so they have long hated our defending army and customs.</p>

<h3>Reporters' Delegation Crosses the Gobi Desert, Arrives at Dunhuang via Anxi</h3>
<p>[Our Anxi Dispatch, 16th] After visiting the Chijin Farm on the 15th, the reporters' delegation crossed 224 kilometers of the Gobi Desert in seven hours. Except for the continuous fields near the outskirts of Yumen and the relatively wide grassland of Mogongtan, it is an endless stretch of sand and gravel. The Qilian Mountains to the south and the Mazong Mountains to the north are visible. Rain was encountered on the way, and it was even heavier when arriving at Anxi. Anxi is the ancient Shazhou, where sand and stones fly all year round, and the rainfall is very small. This rain avoids the suffering of sand and gravel and marching in the heat. In the evening, we talked with County Magistrate Chi and others about the recent situation of Mazongshan and the local people's livelihood. The rain stopped on the 16th and we arrived at Dunhuang.</p>

<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 17th] Of the 34 ships donated by the United States and docked in the Philippines, a relatively complete portion has been formally accepted by the representative of our country stationed in the Philippines. In order to save expenses, the authorities contracted with the Metro Company of Manila, Philippines, to have the company send personnel to be fully responsible for towing the ships to Zuoying, Taiwan.

<h3>A Ming Dynasty Silver Mine Discovered in Gutian County, Fujian Province</h3>
<p>[United Press, Fuzhou, 17th] An ancient silver mine, forgotten for more than 300 years, has been discovered in Gutian County, about 100 miles northwest of here.

Later, the miners were angry with the corruption of the bureaucrats, and a rebellion occurred, clashing with government soldiers, resulting in many deaths and injuries. The silver mine was sealed and forgotten until now. However, whether there is still silver in the mine, and how much is stored, is still uncertain.</p>
<h3>Zou Bingwen Talks to Reporters About Rural Reconstruction Work; the Governing Body Will Be Established Soon</h3>
<p>[Our News] Yesterday, a reporter visited Dr. Zou Bingwen, President of the Chinese Agricultural Society, and asked for his opinion on using US aid to revitalize China's rural areas. He said: "Rural reconstruction work is something that the country should do in peacetime. Now that US aid has been allocated, it is embarrassing to talk about rural reconstruction work again, but it would be even more embarrassing if the work is not done well after accepting aid from others. To do things well, there are only two points: (1) have a plan, (2) have the right person in charge. As far as I know, China still does not have a rural reconstruction plan. This time, 21 groups related to agriculture, water conservancy, and land administration across the country contributed opinions to the government and drafted a plan for rural reconstruction in China, which focuses on three points: (1) increased agricultural production, because the largest part of the rural economy is agricultural products, the most important part of domestic commerce is agricultural products, and the country spends the most money importing agricultural products every year, so increased agricultural production should be the top priority. (2) Water conservancy: In addition to agricultural technology itself, the most important thing for increased agricultural production is water conservancy. Too much or too little water can affect increased production. (3) Rural land administration: The most important asset in rural areas is farmland, and land reform is an economic and political issue, so rural reconstruction work must pay attention to land administration issues. This time, 21 related groups gathered more than 40 experts, spent three weeks discussing the results, prepared a plan to send to the government, and the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, Water Conservancy, and Land Administration have funded printing costs, and decided to print thousands of copies of the plan, which will be published on the 22nd of this month. If needed, people from all walks of life can write to the Chinese Agricultural Society at Shuanglong Lane, Nanjing. I am not in a position to say how perfect the plan is, but it is a contribution to the country that it is the crystallization of the research and discussion of 21 groups and more than 40 experts. Regarding the governing body of rural reconstruction work, I heard that the US Aid Rural Reconstruction Committee will be established soon. The number of committee members will be three appointed by the President of China and two appointed by the President of the United States. The 21 groups have told the heads of the Sino-US relationship that these committee members must pay attention to having specialized technical and administrative capabilities. The three Chinese members must be hired from agriculture, water conservancy, and land administration, and the two American members must also be hired from these three aspects. You must not fill the number with "all-purpose" talents, then there is hope for the success of the cause.</p>
<h3>Two Major Policy Guidelines for Zhejiang: Ensuring Security and Increasing Production; Chen Yi Claims Preliminary Plans Have Been Made</h3>
<p>[Our Hangzhou Dispatch, 17th] Chairman Chen Yi hosted a press conference last night for the first time, clarifying that the policy guidelines are to ensure security and increase production. Preliminary plans have been made for the former, namely adjusting administrative inspectorate commissioners to specialize in military affairs. For Chen's two major tasks, he will start by improving the system and clarifying official corruption. Therefore, he will first carry out a revolution in official documents, advocating hierarchical responsibility, using vernacular Chinese, and improving the personnel system so that the transfer of county magistrates is like that of bank managers. Finally, he said: he welcomes criticism from all sectors because the more truth is debated, the clearer it becomes. Subsequently, reporters from various newspapers provided suggestions for the authorities to consider.</p>
<p>[Another Dispatch] Chairman Chen is very concerned about the construction of farmland irrigation in Zhejiang Province. He is planning new ways to prosper the rural areas and has secured irrigation loans of 3.14 billion, with another 4.16 billion to be loaned out soon. A committee will be established to manage the funds, and a universal irrigation benefit fee will be levied throughout the province.</p>

<h3>My Country's Shipping Industry is Beset with Crises; Shipping Circles Hope the Government Will Pay Attention</h3>
<p>[This City News] People in China's shipping industry believe that the US policy of supporting Japan has a significant impact on the future of China's shipping construction. According to Jiang Keni, Secretary-General of the National Federation of Senior Merchant Marine Officers of China, the comprehensive opinions are as follows: (1) The government should immediately adopt a proactive policy to protect the shipping industry, refuse any foreign merchant ships from entering China's inland rivers, so as to maintain shipping rights. (2) The government should accept the request of Chinese shipowners and not allow Japanese ships to carry Taiwanese sugar until Sino-Japanese relations have been restored. (3) The rise of the Japanese shipping industry directly threatens the development of China's shipping industry. China should immediately demand that Japan first compensate 500,000 tons of ships (Japan currently has 1.4 million tons remaining). (4) The government should, on the one hand, effectively protect nautical technical personnel, and on the other hand, expand the equipment of merchant marine schools and actively cultivate engine and driving talents. (5) The government should assist in improving the organization of seafarer groups, effectively guide low-level seafarers, and promote sincere cooperation between labor and capital. (6) The government should select technical personnel to go to advanced shipbuilding countries to inspect and study shipbuilding engineering, in order to build new ships ourselves.</p>

<h3>US Increases Air Force Reinforcements in Europe; Sixty Superfortresses Arrive in England; Bombing Exercises in Germany in the Short Term</h3>
<p>[United Press, Scampton, England, 17th] A large number of US Superfortresses, flown by veterans of the war against Japan and Germany, arrived in England today, landing at three airfields in East Anglia. This is the largest display of US air power in Europe since the war. The 28th team will be based here, while the 307th team will be distributed in Marham and Watton, both of which have longer runways for giant bombers.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Marham, Lincolnshire, 17th] Sixty Superfortresses flying from the United States to England to be temporarily stationed at British air force bases may be delayed due to dense clouds over the Atlantic. As of noon today, only thirteen aircraft have arrived at three airfields in England. After landing in one of the first Superfortresses to arrive in England, the commander of the US 28th Air Division said that this trip was another routine training flight, similar to those flown to Japan. There have been many such flights in the past, and there will be more in the future. He added that there may be some ammunition on board for training purposes, but it will definitely not be used to shoot people. At the same time, Lieutenant General Lee May, commander of the US Air Force in Europe, said in Wiesbaden, in the US military zone in Germany, that Superfortresses may conduct bombing exercises with US fighter planes and bombers currently stationed in Germany, and Superfortresses may occasionally land in the US military zone in Germany. The London Observer believes that the arrival of the US Superfortresses is a demonstration directly related to the Berlin crisis.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 17th] During the Berlin crisis, these US planes will continue to be stationed in Europe. US planes will use British air force bases while in England. Unconfirmed reports say that French air force bases will also be loaned to US planes. The US Air Force personnel accompanying the Superfortresses to England number as many as 1,500. Repair personnel and supplies will continue to be transported to England by other aircraft. Earlier, the British Air Ministry also announced that the Royal Air Force also plans to deploy bombers to supplement the Berlin airlift system.</p>
<p>[United Press, London, 16th] The US Embassy in England announced today that the United States has decided to send sixty B29 Superfortresses to England for short-term training. This is part of the long-range flight plan stipulated by the Strategic Air Command more than a year ago. After staying in England for two to four weeks, they will fly to Germany and be placed under the command of Lee May, Commander of the US Air Force in Europe. There are currently thirty Superfortresses in Germany. The London Evening News believes that the arrival of a large contingent of bombers symbolizes the first major demonstration by Western countries since the Soviet Union blockaded Berlin. It is said that although these aircraft will not participate in the airlift to Berlin, Western countries are prepared to fully resist any attempt to interfere with the aerial supply line.</p>
<h3>US Attaches Importance to the Berlin Situation; Congress Scheduled to Convene on the 26th of This Month; Preemptive Measures to Deal with the Soviet Union</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 17th] After this winter's US election, whether Dewey wins and the Republican Party takes power, or Truman is re-elected and the Democratic Party continues to govern, there will be no major changes in US foreign policy. Both parties guarantee to continue to implement the established bipartisan foreign policy, take the lead in international issues, and jointly promote a constructive peace plan to counter the expansion of communism. Congress has scheduled a special session for July 26. Truman and the government's foreign policy leaders, as well as both parties in Congress, will liaise closely on foreign policy issues in the coming weeks to develop ways to deal with the policies adopted by the Soviet Union in Germany.</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 16th] Officials announced tonight that the US increase in the number of air force personnel stationed in Europe is a forceful action in response to the Berlin situation. The governments of the United States, Britain, and France are currently considering taking tough retaliatory measures to deal with the Soviet Union in order to break the Berlin blockade and will implement economic sanctions if necessary. The concentration of a large number of US planes in England is an unprecedented event since the war. Although this does not mean that the US Air Force will immediately resume large-scale operations there, it proves that the British and American governments have achieved close cooperation in dealing with the Berlin issue militarily and politically. Air Force authorities emphasized that the dispatch of B-29 bombers to England is only for training purposes. However, with the situation in Europe so tense, the relationship between this batch of US planes and the Soviet threat near Berlin is very obvious, and it cannot be concealed by official denials that the Berlin situation is the reason for the air force deployment. According to well-informed sources, the initial use of force will be limited to prohibiting Soviet ships from passing through the Panama Canal, on the grounds that the Soviet Union has also refused US vehicles from entering Berlin. As for the implementation of economic sanctions, in addition to the Western countries, other countries will be asked to cooperate in the sanctions. In addition, it is planned to send troops to protect trucks to Berlin, ordering them to break through Soviet obstacles if necessary.</p>
<h3>Food Storage in West Berlin</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 16th] Western allies today announced several new measures in West Berlin, including reducing the supply of electricity for industrial use and prohibiting vehicles carrying food and coal from leaving West Berlin.

<h3>Unsettled Account of the Berlin Plane Crash; Britain Demands Compensation from the Soviet Union</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 17th] Britain has again demanded compensation from the Soviet Union for the loss of a Viking airliner and the lives of personnel that were destroyed in a collision with a Soviet plane over Berlin in April. Well-informed sources believe that if the Soviet Union refuses to pay compensation, Britain will appeal to the International Court of Justice.</p>
<h3>Soviet and Mongolian Troops Clash with Germans in Germany</h3>

Each time, it was delayed due to poor weather, taking a total of 13 hours.</p>
<h3>Soviet Aircraft Groups Practice Flying in the Air Corridor from Berlin to West Germany; The Purpose is to Interfere with the British and American Airlift</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Berlin, 17th] The number of Soviet fighter planes practicing flying in the air corridor between West Germany and Berlin increased suddenly today. Although Soviet planes had been practicing flying there for several days, the number of aircraft participating in the group suddenly increased greatly today, with the intention of interfering with the airlift of Western allies. At the same time, Western allies have taken steps to increase the amount of airlift from West Germany to Berlin. Many British four-engine York aircraft and Royal Air Force four-engine transport aircraft originally traveling between Europe and the Far East have been transferred to Germany. Royal Air Force Chief of Staff Marshal Ted arrived in Berlin yesterday to inspect the airlift situation. British Commander-in-Chief in Germany Robertson hurried back to Berlin from Frankfurt to meet with Ted.</p>
<p>[United Press, Berlin, 17th] The Soviet Union notified the West on the 17th that it would intensify its air activities in the congested Berlin air corridor, including blind training flights in cloudy conditions. The Soviet Union notified the Four Power Air Safety Control Center that it would use nine airfields near the corridor, a move that appears to be further promoting a war of nerves and may even be a direct threat to the British and American airlifts. The poor weather in Berlin has hindered the progress of the airlift. German sources said that the commander of the Soviet Air Force here, Alexander Troff, and his staff were discussing ways to reduce two or three air corridors.</p>
<p>[United Press, Berlin, 16th] US planes flew a total of 251 sorties in the 24 hours from 4:00 PM on the 16th, transporting 1,435 tons of powdered food, coal, and supplies to Berlin. British planes flew a total of 218 sorties, estimated to have transported 872 tons of supplies to Berlin.</p>
<h3>France Plans to Conduct Informal Probing; Negotiate to Resolve the German Issue; Foreign Ministers of Five Western European Countries to Meet in The Hague Tomorrow</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper News] London, 17th Broadcast: The powerful here admit that Britain, the United States, and France will not be in a position to resolve the Berlin issue with the Soviet Union. The three countries of Britain, the United States, and France will continue to negotiate with the Soviet Union to resolve the Berlin issue.

<p>[Reuters, Paris, 17th] Diplomatic circles believe that France's attitude towards the Berlin situation and the political development of West Germany seems to be different from that of Britain and the United States. According to reliable sources, France has been engaged in informal probes to find out the possibility of holding a four-power conference to break the Berlin stalemate. France feels that it is still too early for Western powers to adopt a final showdown attitude on the Berlin situation. France deeply hopes that the meeting of foreign ministers of the five Western European countries to be held in The Hague on the 19th can correct some of the premature showdown attitude. Although the United States does not intend to attend, the Western European Union will fully inform the United States of the meeting situation.

<h3>Two Airlines - Unable to Sustain Operations - Suspend Passenger Registration - Request Two Points from the Ministry of Communications - Shanghai-Nanjing Flights Completely Suspended Starting Today</h3>
<p>[Our Report] China National Aviation Corporation and Central Air Transport Corporation, the only two major civil aviation companies in our country, have decided to temporarily suspend all passenger registration starting today due to the recent skyrocketing prices of gasoline, increased expenses, and the unsustainable operational environment. Those who have already registered will still be transported as much as possible, and mail and emergency transportation will still be maintained with great effort. At the same time, a telegram was sent to the Ministry of Communications to seek a solution as soon as possible, requesting: (1) permission to settle foreign exchange according to the official rate, without the need for foreign exchange certificates; (2) if the above is not possible, an increase in freight rates by 150% to 200% according to the current rates. If this request is not approved, air transport may be completely suspended. Liu Jingyi, manager of China National Aviation Corporation, Wang Heling, Chief Financial Officer, Chen Zhuolin, General Manager of Central Air Transport Corporation, and Cha Zhenhu, Deputy General Manager, jointly hosted a press conference yesterday afternoon to explain the actual situation of the two companies, hoping that all sectors of society would understand and sympathize. According to CATA Deputy General Manager Cha, both airlines have been striving to maintain operations under difficult conditions since the Anti-Japanese War, but the current economic situation has forced them to face the greatest crisis. More than 70% of the operating costs of both companies need to be paid in foreign exchange, including (1) gasoline, (2) parts, and (3) the salaries of flight personnel. Gasoline is the most significant expense. When the price of gasoline rose to more than 100,000 per gallon in March and April, freight rates were adjusted twice, and the government stipulated that 250,000 US dollars could be exchanged at the official rate each month from the Central Bank, so the revenue and expenditure could still offset each other at that time. In May, the price of oil rose again, and freight rates were not adjusted. In June, the foreign exchange certificate method was promulgated, and the price of oil jumped several times. Although freight rates were adjusted twice, the difference was too great. Statistics show that as of the 16th of this month, the cost increased by 2544% compared to February, while freight rates only increased by 816%. At the same time, due to the abolition of the official rate foreign exchange settlement method, the company was unable to pay the exchange rate difference for the foreign exchange certificate. Since June 8, the company has relied on loans from the Central Bank to maintain operations. China National Aviation Corporation borrowed more than 1.1 trillion, and Central Air Transport Corporation borrowed more than 800 billion. If the authorities do not take measures by the 20th of this month, air transportation will be difficult to maintain thereafter. Therefore, passenger registration has to be suspended temporarily starting today. Regarding the two points requested from the government, if it is indeed difficult to implement the method of not using foreign exchange certificates, then adjusting freight rates is a must. Currently, China's air freight rates are actually the lowest in the world. Taking the United States as an example, the freight rate per mile is 7.5 US cents, and the fare from New York to Washington is 17 US dollars, a distance equivalent to that from Shanghai to Nanjing, while the current fare from Shanghai to Nanjing is less than one US dollar.</p>
<p>[Another Report] China National Aviation Corporation and Central Air Transport Corporation jointly issued a notice last night. Due to soaring oil prices and unbearable losses, they have had to completely suspend the Shanghai-Nanjing line. Other lines, such as Shanghai-Beijing, Shanghai-Chongqing, and Shanghai-Guangzhou, will reduce the number of flights to reduce losses. Airmail will still be carried as much as possible.</p>
<h3>Mayor's Remarks After Returning to Shanghai - Believes US Aid Can Stabilize Prices - Requests Monthly Subsidy of 2 Trillion for City Government</h3>
<p>[Our Report] Mayor Wu returned to Shanghai at 8:00 AM yesterday (the 17th) after attending the joint meeting of the US Aid Utilization Committee and the China Branch of the Economic Cooperation Administration in Beijing on the 15th. He went directly to his official residence to rest after getting off the train, and went to the city government to work yesterday afternoon.</p>
<p>At 5:00 PM yesterday, Mayor Wu met with reporters at the city government office. He said that in addition to attending the meeting, he also visited Premier Weng of the Executive Yuan and separately visited Finance Minister Wang Yunwu and Food Minister Guan Jiyu to report on the recent price situation in the city. The central authorities also believe that the skyrocketing prices are a national economic problem and not just a leadership issue in Shanghai. Taking the price of rice as an example, when Mayor Wu was in Beijing on the 16th, the price of rice there was higher than that in Shanghai. Wu stated: US aid can be used by the end of August, of which 20 million US dollars will be used to stabilize finance, which is enough to make up for currency inflation, and he believes that prices can be stabilized in the future.</p>
<p>Regarding the city's financial difficulties, Mayor Wu made a statement to Finance Minister Wang, requesting an appropriation of 2 trillion yuan per month to make up for the deficit. Minister Wang agreed in principle and will submit it to the Executive Yuan for approval.</p>
<p>Regarding the hoarding of grain in Wuxi, Mayor Wu suggested that a portion of the tax grain, about 200,000 dan, be sold at market prices to stabilize public sentiment and stabilize grain prices. Minister Guan has accepted this suggestion.</p>
<h3>Illegal Yarn Companies - Punished Separately</h3>

<h3>Request to Restore Gold Jewelry Transactions First</h3>
<p>[Our Report] The method for restoring the gold jewelry trading business in the city's silver buildings has been passed by the municipal government meeting a month ago, stipulating that transactions should be based on the exchange rate of the Central Bank's foreign exchange certificate, but it must be reported to the Ministry of Finance for approval before formal implementation.

<h3>Agile and Swift Action by the City Police Bureau's Flying Fortress: Duty Team Members Maintain Constant Vigilance</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from This Newspaper] In the many major criminal cases that have occurred in this city in the past six months, the Police Bureau's Flying Fortress has given the public an exceptionally fresh and clear impression. Swift in action and effective in results, on the grand stage, facing alarming disturbances, each team member seems to possess inexhaustible energy, controlling everything from beginning to end.</p>
<p>The Police Bureau has put a lot of thought and planning into cultivating this energy. From the city's more than ten thousand long-term police officers, sixty team members were selected, and from the hundreds and thousands of internal and external personnel, two chief and deputy commanders and four commanders were appointed. Added to this are several mobile vehicles; that is their entire organization. But within it already reside administrative, legal, and criminal experts, nearly thirty kinds of dialects, and over ten modern skills such as shooting, driving, combat, and swimming, as well as many novel scientific knowledge. This entirely young and unmarried team has only been established for half a year, yet theft cases in the city center, especially the banking district, have clearly decreased sharply. The appropriate explanation for this fact is that robbers fear their new capture techniques and, even more so, the shortened capture speed, which is enough to threaten the time for carrying out robberies.</p>
<p>Deployed in 45 Seconds</p>
<p>Why is the Flying Fortress's deployment rate so high? This is due to the high performance of the telecommunications control room. When a victim reports an alarm using the numbers 12220 or 15380, the control room immediately triggers the bell before inquiring about the details. Before the alarm bell stops ringing, the mobile vehicles have already driven out and are standing by. The team members then put on protective vests in the vehicle, prepare their weapons and ammunition, and wipe the searchlights. Once the commander receives detailed orders, boards the vehicle, and starts it, the entire process takes no more than forty-five seconds. According to their records, it takes 13 minutes to drive from the team headquarters to Guanghua University at night, and 15 minutes to reach the Da Guangming Theater during the day. Despite the police car shouting all the way without obstruction, congested traffic still causes some variation in their arrival time.</p>
<p>Originally Just a Husband and Wife Quarrel</p>
<p>During their time on duty, the team members experience a level of nervous tension incomparable to any other profession, constantly listening to the alarm bell and always preparing for a fight. The commander works even harder, getting only three hours of rest each day. Upon receiving an alarm, he is responsible for keeping the destination secret and giving instructions on the vehicle to prevent the driver from colluding with outsiders. Upon arrival at the scene, he uses the colored lights on the front of the vehicle to direct the assembly and dispersal of the team and their movements. Every time they are stationed in the team headquarters, waiting on standby, their tense emotions often conjure up fantasies about the scene of the incident: bandits, crowds, thugs… swiftly subdue them! Just waiting for the alarm bell to ring. Once, the alarm bell rang, and they excitedly rushed to the scene, but there was no activity. Upon investigation, it turned out to be a quarrel between a young couple. The woman, unwilling to be at a disadvantage, rushed out to call the Flying Fortress for help. By the time they arrived, the couple had already turned their tears into smiles and reconciled as before.</p>
<p>Eloquence Defuses Crowds</p>
<p>To date, the Flying Fortress has not been involved in many bloody battles, but their performance in cleverly deterring stubborn enemies has been quite successful. In a major robbery in the Jing'an District, the twelve team members were outnumbered by the robbers. They used a roundabout encirclement method to delay the target until the main force arrived and made the capture. The night before last, at the Da Hua and Guo Tai theaters, a dispute over limited-price tickets after a price increase caused an uproar among the audience. It is said that they used their eloquent skills to stabilize the crowd, who were attempting to rush into the theater, in a democratic and gentle manner.</p>
<p>From the statistics of the number of deployments of the Flying Fortress from December of last year to the end of June this year, we can see the general public security situation in Shanghai: 34 theft alarms, 13 labor strikes, 6 student strikes, 8 riots, 69 surprise inspections, 40 false alarms, and 47 investigations of stolen vehicles.</p>
<p>To understand the impact of this social unrest on everyone's lives, we really should first understand the Flying Fortress's concern for every citizen and the hard work it undertakes for us.</p>

<h3>Military Throws Grenades at Two Theaters, Causing Tragedy: Garrison Command Sternly Interrogates Suspects</h3>
<p>[Report from This Newspaper] The night before last, at the Da Wu Tai and Gong Wu Tai theaters, military personnel, prevented from watching the show without tickets, threw hand grenades, causing a tragic incident resulting in more than ten deaths and injuries. Afterwards, the First Battalion of the Ninth Regiment of the Military Police arrested 23 military personnel suspected of causing the incident at the scene. Yesterday morning at 2:00 AM, they were transferred to the Garrison Command along with brief statements taken during the interrogation. Yesterday, the Military Law Department of the Garrison Command conducted a strict interrogation all day. Soldier Yang Shu Yun, who was injured at the Da Shi Jie, sought treatment at the Nanyang Hospital on his own. Upon learning that he was suspected of throwing grenades at the Da Shi Jie, the Garrison Command has sent personnel to monitor him at the hospital. Once Yang's condition improves slightly, the case will be handled jointly. It is reported that the soldiers who initiated the incident will be severely punished if the facts are verified.</p>
<p>Youth Army Brigade Commander Discusses Investigation Process</p>
<p>Brigade Commander Fang of the Second Brigade of the 202nd Division of the Youth Army stationed in this city recently told reporters: Our brigade is responsible for the defense of Songhu and has the responsibility to maintain local public security. All officers and soldiers are able to strictly abide by discipline and care for the people. After the bloodshed at the two theaters the night before last, after receiving a telegram from Deputy Commander Yang of the Garrison Command, I immediately dispatched Chief of Staff Liu Changtai and Director Shen Min of the Political Work Department to the Da Wu Tai and Gong Wu Tai theaters to investigate. I also sent a squad of soldiers to guard and inspect the area around Tiantong'an Road on North Sichuan Road for any soldiers from our brigade coming and going. I also personally went to the barracks in Jiangwan to gather and call the roll of the officers and soldiers, and learned that no officers or soldiers from our brigade had gone out. Subsequently, Director Shen reported by telephone that the Garrison Command had discovered that the troublemakers were soldiers from a passing unit and had nothing to do with our division. Only then did I order the guarding troops to withdraw to the barracks. As for soldier Shen Deming of the Sixth Regiment, who was arrested at the entrance of the Da Wu Tai, he happened to be passing through the area after the tragic incident and was mistakenly arrested. This was an accidental event and he was not involved in the disturbance. However, since the Sixth Regiment is stationed in the Nanhui area, the reason why the soldier came to Shanghai, whether he had leave, has been ordered to be thoroughly investigated and dealt with by the officer in charge. Regarding the recent frequent incidents of passing military personnel causing trouble in this city, and the endless stream of cases of people posing as military personnel, our brigade has decided to discuss with the Garrison Command to jointly execute crackdowns with the military police to maintain order.</p>
<h3>Four Ephemeral Flowers Bloom in Splendor at the Great Shanghai Hotel</h3>
<p>[Report from This Newspaper] At 9:00 PM last night, four ephemeral flowers simultaneously bloomed in the flowerbed of the Great Shanghai Hotel on Tianjin Road in this high city. By 11:00 PM, they were in full bloom, with red stems and white petals, exceptionally bright and fragrant. For a time, many people gathered to watch, but by around 1:00 AM, they had already withered. It is reported that the flowerbed was arranged by Li Pu Chen, the former manager of the Great Shanghai Hotel, the deceased father of lawyer Li Chao Nian. There are many famous flowers in the flowerbed, and the two ephemeral flowers have been planted for eight years. Twelve flowers bloomed last year, and five more bloomed a week ago. One also bloomed the day before yesterday, so yesterday was the third time they have bloomed. Dozens of members of the Li family gathered around the flower table last night, sipping tea and admiring them, enjoying the mood.</p>

<h3>Dance Craze Case Concludes: Sentence to Be Pronounced on the 23rd: Photography Reporters Invited to Testify Yesterday: Lawyers' Request for Bail Denied</h3>
<p>[Report from This Newspaper] The dance craze case, which was tried all day the day before yesterday, continued to be heard by Judge Zhong Xian Da in the Second Court of the District Court at 9:30 AM yesterday. Except for Ye Ling, who was absent due to illness, all defendants were present in court to answer questions. Debate began at 11:25 AM and did not end until 2:30 PM in the afternoon. It was announced that the debate was over and the sentence would be pronounced at 2:00 PM on the 23rd.</p>
<p>When the judge, prosecutor, and clerk ascended the court at 9:35 AM, they first summoned witnesses Yang Ben Jun, Li Mao Mao, and Gu Lin Sheng, drivers from the Songshan Police Station. Gu Ting Peng, a photography reporter from this newspaper, Huang Zhang Cai, a reporter from the Shi Shi Photography Agency, and Han Cheng Qing, a reporter from the Da Gong Bao, were also invited to testify. The testimonies of the witnesses were mostly favorable to the defendants.</p>
<p>At 11:25 AM, prosecutor Huang Da Ping stood up and read the indictment. The defendants' lawyers then began their arguments. Zhou Yi Zhi, defending Zhu Mou and sixteen others, first said that the defendants' crimes were due to a small number of officials who were unaware of the severity of unemployment and banned dancing with a single order without passing it through the Legislative Yuan. Many people have spoken about this in the Special Criminal Court. The Special Criminal Court's ruling that it would not hear the case was wise, and he hoped that the presiding judge would make a final decision based on this principle.</p>
<p>Lawyer Zhou continued, saying that the defendants were willing to do anything because they were driven by hunger and were not premeditating. He pointed out that petitions are originally a legal action under the Constitution, and the indictment also stated, "The crowd was subjected to this unexpected stimulus..." He also said, "The bureau was in a meeting and was unable to come out to meet in time... leading to misunderstandings... due to the agitation of the crowd's psychology..." From this it can be seen that: (1) the Social Bureau was unable to cope; (2) the psychology of the crowd is different from individual crime and cannot be lumped together. Therefore, this is only an occasional dispute and cannot be compared to a riot. Furthermore, the number of petitioners reached more than four thousand, among whom those who truly beat people and destroyed property had already fled, and those who had a clear conscience were arrested instead. He asked the presiding judge to pay attention to how much the Social Bureau actually lost and whether the injured had injury reports.</p>
<p>Finally, he said that the indictment stated that the defendants were forced by life to commit crimes due to temporary emotional impulses. Therefore, he requested that Article 59 of the Criminal Law on mitigating sentences be used to impose lenient punishment. However, the article cited by the prosecutor in the indictment was the latter part of Article 136 of the Criminal Law. According to this article, it can only be applied to obstructing public officials from performing their duties. But in fact, this dispute did not target public officials. Therefore, the cited article is very inappropriate. Considering the circumstances, only Article 352 and 354 of the Criminal Law on the crime of destroying or damaging property can be cited, plus the mitigation of Article 59, to be fair.</p>
<p>Afterwards, the defendants' lawyers stood up and spoke one after another, generally the same as the previous paragraph. Wang Fu Qiang emphasized that the detention time of the detained people may have exceeded the date they should be detained and requested that they be allowed bail.</p>
<p>At 2:30 PM in the afternoon, the debate ended, and Judge Zhong announced that the sentence would be pronounced at 2:00 PM on the 23rd. The detained defendants were returned to custody, but if a medical examiner proved that they were ill, they could be granted bail. Then the court adjourned.</p>

<h3>Secretary's Wife Unable to Bear to Look Back: Husband Unfaithful and in Love with Another: Destitute and Ill in the Relief Association</h3>
<p>Peng Le Shan, the English secretary of the Municipal Government during Mayor Qian's tenure, abandoned his wife Wu He Fen. Due to the pressure of life, Wu turned to the Chinese Women and Children Relief Association for assistance and filed a lawsuit against Peng in the local court for abandonment. The court ordered mediation, and Peng agreed to give Wu He Fen 20 million yuan as living expenses for their daughter. However, only 5 million yuan was paid at the time, and the rest has not been paid to this day. After the lawsuit ended, Wu He Fen, finding that the 5 million yuan she received was insufficient to support her life, still resided in the Relief Association. Her life and nutrition were insufficient, and her mood was resentful. Both mother and daughter, poor and destitute, were plagued by illness and were now in dire straits. Wu He Fen and Peng Le Shan were both from prominent families in Hunan. During middle school, Peng relentlessly pursued Wu, but was opposed by Wu's mother, so he did not achieve his goal and each got married. Years later, during the Anti-Japanese War, the two reunited in Chongqing, and their old love rekindled. Although each had already formed a family, Le Shan's pursuit of He Fen was no less than before. In the end, He Fen's husband became suspicious and divorced her. Wu and Peng finally got their lifelong wish. After the victory, Peng came to Shanghai to serve as the secretary of the Municipal Government and concurrently served as the deputy director of the Central Broadcasting Station. He fell in love with a female staff member, which ultimately led to this tragedy.</p>
<h3>General Labor Union Asks to Issue a Circular to Trade Associations: Wages Should Be Paid According to the Current Index</h3>
<p>Recently, commodity prices have fluctuated sharply, increasing several times a day. If workers' wages are still calculated according to last month's index, they will suffer greatly. Yesterday, workers from various cigarette factories gathered at the Workers' Welfare Association of the industry to request that the factory owners be asked to calculate wages according to the current index. The standing committee members of the association, such as Zhou Xue Xiang, met with them separately and promised to find a way to negotiate. It is learned that the Labor-Capital Cooperation Promotion Association of the industry will hold a meeting today to discuss a solution.</p>
<p>In addition, the Anle Cotton Wool Factory, the Da Zhonghua Rubber Factory, the Dyeing and Weaving Industry Union, and others petitioned the General Labor Union to request that the factories calculate wages according to the current month's index. The General Labor Union decided to ask the authorities to issue a circular to all trade associations to comply.</p>

<h3>Lobotomy (3): New Achievements of Young Doctor Liu Mingduo</h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent Shao Shen Zhi</p>
<p>[Dispatch from This Newspaper, Qingdao, 12th by Air] Private Liu Shao Zhi, from Guizhou, 41 years old, was in combat when a large artillery shell exploded not far away. He fell to the ground in response, unconscious, but not injured. When he woke up, he became insane. He was admitted to the hospital on January 13th of this year and was diagnosed with schizophrenia. His symptoms were unpredictable joy, anger, sorrow, and happiness, and he often talked to himself, with a wide range of topics, repeating them over and over again, which was unbearable. He would constantly murmur to the outside world under the window in the corridor, several times a day in the same place. Apart from his name and origin, the rest of his answers were irrelevant. His movements were slow, and he maintained every small movement for a long time and without any meaning. He ate normally. His behavior was absurd, and he often looked for people to fight. He was indifferent to everything and only cared about taking care of his daily life, but without any special characteristics.</p>
<p>This madman underwent Lobotomy on the morning of June 18th at 10:00 AM. The operation was completed at 12:00 noon, and the situation was good. Now he has returned to normal. On the 8th of this month, when Liu Mingduo was invited to attend a report at the Qingdao Branch of the Medical Association, he was asked by the members to bring Liu Shao Zhi along. He sat in a soft car, and when he was in such a scene, he became a little nervous and uncomfortable. He is now lying down to recuperate.</p>
<p>"Patients need special spiritual warmth after the operation!"</p>
<p>Another one is Zheng Han Zhang, a 20-year-old Guangdong private, who was admitted to the hospital on March 1st. The following is recorded on the case history: "The patient's family cannot be investigated. It is said that only one member of the family has never contracted venereal disease or other infectious diseases. He suffered a gunshot wound to his left leg last year and was cured by the troops. He returned to the team after he recovered. He has never suffered a head injury. He studied for two years and can write his own name. He has been in the army for two years and is brave in combat. He has killed several enemies."</p>
<p>His symptoms are constant depression, tight brows, silence, but sometimes he sings alone. Or he mutters incessantly. When he gets impulsive, he destroys the furniture in the room and tears up his bedding. He suddenly runs away without a trace, and then returns to the hospital again two or three days later. When talking to him, he does not answer the question. But he remembers his name quickly. He can mostly remember the past, but if it is a little more detailed, he cannot answer. He often suspects that others want to harm him. He locks himself in his room and only takes care of his clothes, which are very tidy. He puts all the things in his clothes and does not ask about anything outside. He ignores the noise outside. At night, he becomes restless and suffers from insomnia. His appetite is normal. Sometimes he is very stubborn, refusing to change his dirty clothes or cut his hair. He is not interested in new learning. He has not forgotten what he has learned in the past, and he often repeats one action. He often shows shameless behavior. He does not know the amount of money. He likes to brag and exaggerate his bravery in combat.</p>
<p>This is what a madman looks like. The madness shown by this thin Chinese man is very obvious: he is completely crushed by the current life!</p>
<p>This madman had surgery at 2:30 PM on July 2nd, which was completed at 4:20 PM. Similarly, two holes with a diameter of about 3.5 cm were opened in the left and right parietal bones and cut. The process was good. A week later, he was able to get up and move around freely. Today, he took a photo with Dr. Liu Mingduo and answered several simple questions correctly. He did not seem to be crazy. The military hospital will continue to allow these recovered patients to stay and observe and record their future changes.</p>

<p>[Our Xiaoshan Office, 15th] For the nailing of doorplates throughout the county, the county government collected 18,000 yuan per household as a cost fee in March. Later, at the end of June, claiming the amount was insufficient, it collected another 20,000 yuan per household. However, the doorplates have still not been manufactured. The funds have all been embezzled by Yuan Youxuan, the Chief of the Civil Affairs Section. It is estimated that with over 100,000 households in the county, the amount embezzled exceeds 40 billion. The Fifth County Council has vehemently criticized this, and the section chief has been dismissed and is under investigation.</p>
<h3>Grain Profiteers Leap and Swarm in Xiaoshan; Public School Teachers and Staff Painfully Appeal</h3>
<p>[Our Xiaoshan Office, 16th] Before the arms traffickers have been eliminated, "grain profiteers" have emerged in Xiaoshan. The salaries of public school teachers and staff throughout the county are all paid with grain coupons from the Field Grain Office. However, the various offices refuse to exchange the coupons for grain. Forced by their livelihood, the public school teachers and staff painfully sell them at low prices to "grain profiteers," who then sell them at high prices to landowners for tax payment. At the same time, the Field Grain Offices each act independently, exchanging high-quality grain for inferior grain, which has become commonplace. Moreover, the exchange rate for "using currency to offset taxes" is inconsistent, with each office consistently exceeding the local rice price by a significant amount, which is heavily criticized by all sectors. This matter is now like a raging tide in the Qiantang River, becoming a major public concern for all public school teachers and staff in the county. It is said that they will appeal to all sectors for improvements.</p>

<h3>Scarce Supply, Robust Sales: Rice Prices Rise Sharply; Flour and Edible Oil Also Increase by 10-20%</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the rice market saw a sharp increase in prices. Due to the significant rise in various outside commodities and a loosening of credit, although the quoted prices in Wuxi were not high, public sentiment was particularly anxious. The morning market rose by 2 million, and due to strong actual sales, it rose by another approximately 2 million, for a total increase of 3.5 to 4 million. In the northern market, japonica, indica, and lamb indica rice were each priced at 33.5 million, with premium japonica reaching 36.5 million. The southern market also rose by 3-4 million, with rough indica rice at a final price of 27.5 million. The total arrival of goods in both northern and southern markets yesterday was 2,368 stones.</p>
<p>Flour prices fluctuated sharply. Factories released limited quantities. Old brand flour opened at 9.7 million, but strong buying interest pushed it past the 10 million mark, eventually reaching 10.5 million. Bingchuan flour closed at 9.8 million. Jiancheng, Hongfeng, and various other brands all increased by 1.2 to 1.3 million. Wheat bran rose by nearly 1 million, and wheat traded at 13 million, with few sellers, representing an increase of 1 million.</p>
<p>Coarse grains rose sharply again, with a general increase of 15%. Soybeans initially held steady, but a small quantity of summer beans was offered at 17 million, closing at 17.5 million. Winter beans were being purchased by the Qingdao group, opening at 21 million, an increase of 2-3 million. Corn and wheat bran were actively sold to the north, rising by 2-3 million. Mung beans rose by about 2 million, scarlet beans traded at 36 million, broad beans increased by 1.5 million, and sesame seeds rose by 2 million, with white sesame seeds trading at 40 million. Raw peanuts were scarce and consumed quickly, resulting in a sharp increase of 10 million.</p>
<p>Edible oils soared, and market sentiment was extraordinarily tight. Various oils rose by nearly 20%. With buyers scrambling to purchase at the opening, soybean oil opened at 77 million and rapeseed oil at 73 million. Near closing, there were more sellers, but prices decreased by 1 million. Dah You soybean oil traded at 76 million, Tongfeng soybean oil at 74 million, and Jitong rapeseed oil reached the huge price of 100 million, an increase of 1.5 million.

<h3>Central Trust Bureau Ordered to Sell and Purchase Raw Silk</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] The Central Trust Bureau has recently been ordered to sell and purchase raw silk to tighten credit. As of the day before yesterday, a total of 660,000 bundles had been sold. On the 16th alone, as many as 300,000 dan were sold. The selling price is determined dynamically, fluctuating with market prices. The highest selling price on the 16th was 2.1 billion. At the same time, according to market practice, payment for goods is due within five days. However, the Central Trust Bureau requires payment on the next day for the raw silk it sells, in order to reduce inflation. This raw silk sales operation will continue to be carried out in the future.</p>
<h3>Expiry Date Approaching: Foreign Exchange Certificates Fall</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] The market price of foreign exchange certificates fell to 2.8 million yuan yesterday, before slightly rebounding to around 3 million yuan. The reason for the sharp decline is that the expiry date is approaching, and there is a shortage of funds, forcing sellers to sell at low prices. When the market price fell to 2.8 million yesterday, the Central Bank secretly bought them, causing a slight rebound. However, the current price of foreign exchange certificates is more than double the black market exchange rate for US dollars. The incentive for exports provided by the foreign exchange certificate system has gradually been lost. The National Bank is paying close attention to this and will soon take measures to ensure that foreign exchange certificates have a reasonable selling price.</p>
<h3>Credit Loosens; Most Banks Show Deficits</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the credit situation in this city showed loosening. In the check clearing among banks and money shops, with the exception of the Central Cooperative Treasury showing a surplus of 185.2 billion, all other banks showed deficits, with the total deficit reaching 1,806.5 billion.

The commercial banks and shops in the large clearing showed a surplus of 695.2 billion, the small clearing a surplus of 246.3 billion, and foreign banks a total surplus of 865 billion.</p>
<h3>Rayon Factory Prices Continue to Rise; Silk Prices Slightly Decrease at Closing</h3>
<p>The rayon market continued to rise. The opening price of 120-count Jin San Ma Guang, was similar to the afternoon price of the previous day. Transactions were sparse, and it hovered for a long time. Later, due to rising prices of external commodities, the largest transaction was 2.44 billion yuan for the Monday term. The closing price for spot delivery was reduced to 2.27 billion yuan. The market price for the afternoon was finally 2.3 billion yuan.</p>
<p>Factory spun silk continued to rise in yesterday's market. The Central Trust Company opened sales of B-grade 25 bales at 2.45 billion yuan.

According to statistics from the Tianjin Financial Management Bureau, from June 30th to July 14th, the total amount transferred by the Central Bank to the various banks and bureaus was 828.884 billion yuan. However, the amount settled by the various banks and bureaus was not very large. From July 5th to 10th, the total was 362 billion yuan, of which 303.9 billion yuan was transferred to Shanghai.</p>
<h3>Woolen Cloth Market is Expensive and Popular</h3>
<p>Woolen cloth has recently seen an overall increase in price. The trend for mixed-color, fine-wool woven cloth is particularly strong. The market for dyed woolen cloth is also strong. Due to future environmental conditions, factories are mostly unwilling to offer their products, and stores are also mutually hoarding goods. Glossy woolen cloth is even more expensive and popular than hand-woven woolen cloth. Yesterday, English, Italian, and Western suit woolens were wholesaling for 40 million to 70 million yuan per yard, American goods for 35 million to 50 million yuan, and domestic mixed-color woolen cloth for 25 million to 35 million yuan, and dyed woolen cloth for 15 million to 22 million yuan, it is said.</p>
<h3>Tea Market Foundation is Solid</h3>
<p>After the tea market's price increase reignited the day before yesterday, yesterday, due to credit remaining mediocre and the universal rise in prices of all goods, holders of goods were keen to match the price increase, and the intention to protect prices continued to flourish. Buyers, feeling that actual quality was still good, also readily accepted. However, in this situation, transactions sharply declined. Prices continued to move toward their peak, and the foundation was quite solid.</p>
<h3>Market Sentiment is Excited; Rise in Chinese Stocks Remains Strong</h3>
<p>Yesterday, sentiment in the Chinese stock market was unusually excited, and the rise remained strong. Yongsheng Yarn rose to the limit and then slightly increased. New Guang and Xinyi also rose to the limit, but the addition of water made it difficult to maintain for long. There were ten struggles in the middle, and in the end, small stocks were weak. Furthermore, due to news of increased margin requirements, there was a small pullback at noon.</p>
<p>The morning market inherited the residual wind from the previous closing. Yongsheng Yarn opened high at 10,900 yuan. Immediately after opening, numbers 163, 95, and 126 moved up to the limit, with an additional increase of over one hundred yuan. Numbers 169, 218, 163, 67, 225, 183, 22, 145, and the Guangdong group's 202 actively sold, retreating to 10,770 yuan. Numbers 156, 224, 71, 131, 3, 178, 99, 163, and 15 all entered, and in the middle, there were eight or nine more rises to the limit. New Guang had a pullback after rising to the limit, while Xinyi and Yongye remained at the limit. Struggling until near noon, there was news of increased margin requirements, and cash was extremely tight, and credit had not widened to any extent. In the afternoon, numbers 104, 122, 16, 131, 225, 185, 156, 145, 218, and 4 were unloaded, retreating to a closing price of 10,750 yuan, while Xinhua even fell to the limit.

<p>Government bonds continued to show slight gains yesterday, with transactions not exceeding 2 million. Rooms 1260 and 552 bought, while rooms 50 and 500 sold. The morning opening price of Tong Bing was 1.12 million, with the highest price at 1.17 million, before slightly consolidating. Compared to the previous closing, Jia, Yi, and Wu each rose by 60,000 yuan, Tong Bing rose by 50,000 yuan, and Tong Ding rose sharply by 90,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>Cotton Yarn and Cloth Initially Rose and Then Returned; Fine Cloth Off-Exchange Once Knocked on the Door of 50 Million</h3>
<p>Yesterday's cotton yarn market saw an initial opening with still good buying from the Tianjin and Guangdong groups, and sentiment remained firm, with external factors also providing support. The quoted opening price for 42-count Lanfeng yarn was 2 billion for delivery tomorrow (19th). Later, due to the forced sales of the goods' owner, who were desperate for funds, the quoted price quickly fell to 1.8 billion for same-day delivery, and the market sentiment turned flat. Midway, local buyers took advantage of the opportunity to absorb small quantities, returning by 50 million. Eventually, news arrived that the authorities had notified the cloth market to temporarily suspend gatherings and inspect orders, which was unfavorable news. The final price for delivery next Monday ended at 1.75 billion yuan, a rise of 50 million yuan compared to the previous day. The 40-count and 32-count also initially rose and then returned. The initial transaction for 21-count Shuangma spot yarn was 1.4 billion, and buying interest from various parties was strong, with the price immediately rising by 100 million. Near closing, traders and speculators took advantage of the high prices to sell, ending with spot delivery at 1.35 billion, a rise of 90 million. Delivery the day after tomorrow traded at 1.42 billion, a rise of 120 million. The remaining yarns also showed firmness, with over 240 transactions.</p>
<p>Yesterday's cotton cloth market saw a renewed increase at the morning opening. The off-exchange price of Longtou fine cloth once rose directly to 49.56 million, an unprecedented peak. Subsequently, at approximately 10:20 am, the competent authorities, seeing that the cotton cloth market had risen sharply, telephoned the chairman of the industry association and notified them to temporarily suspend the market. Sentiment suddenly turned weak, and transactions gradually cleared. Traders from Tianjin and Shanxi sold off quite a lot. Longtou fine cloth retreated to 47.5 million near closing, a rise of 20%. However, there were reports that it was sold for as low as 46 million, while other fine cloths, bleached cloth, serge, colored cloth, and Xilin cloth, all showed firmness.</p>
<p>Further news: In addition to selling Longtou fine cloth by tender, the Fangjian Company also had more than ten other varieties, including second-grade gray fabric, auxiliary brand serge gray fabric, second-grade Yuanshai serge, Four Gentlemen Yuanshai mercerized cloth, Touma bleached cloth, and Caihua bedsheets. It is said that the self-filled price for Longtou cloth was 44.5 million yuan.</p>
<h3>Revocation of Licenses for Violating Yarn Shops</h3>

Those whose membership in the Shanghai Yarn Industry Association has been revoked are He Yulun, Dakang, Shencheng, Yida Company, Taichang Gong, and Guanghesheng. Sheng Yuan was notified by the Yarn Association to revoke two entry permits, while Da You and Ji were exempted from deliberation, it is said.</p>
<h3>Tea Merchants Request the Four Joint Offices to Relax Tea Loan Quotas; Scheduled to Visit President Yu Tomorrow to Petition</h3>
<p>In order to absorb large amounts of foreign exchange, maintain the international market, and invigorate China's rural economy, the Shanghai Tea Export Industry Association intends to request the Four Joint Offices to appropriately relax tea loan quotas to facilitate turnover. Tang Jishan presided over a reception for reporters from various newspapers at 3 pm yesterday (17th) on the tenth floor of Wing On, explaining the importance of the issue and hoping that the press would provide strong support. In addition to submitting a telegram to the relevant authorities on the 15th, stating the whole story, the association has also scheduled to send representatives next week to visit President Yu of the National Bank, and possibly go to Nanjing to petition. During the reception, Tang said that if Chinese tea does not quickly catch up in international trade, it is feared that it will decline daily. A look at the world tea production and sales figures published by the American Tea Association reveals the overview. For example, last year, England, America, Canada, and Australia purchased 535 million pounds of black tea from Ceylon and India. Of these, England purchased 370 million pounds, Canada 44 million pounds, America 71 million pounds, and Australia 50 million pounds. In contrast, China exported only 30 million pounds of black and green tea last year. Black tea accounted for one-third of this, a vast difference compared to Ceylon and India. If we calculate China's total output, it can reach 1 million dan per year, which is 110 million pounds. Therefore, only three-elevenths of sales are achieved. It is regrettable that goods are abandoned in the fields and large amounts of foreign exchange have not been earned. Sun Xiaocun reported the actual cost of tea. He claimed: If we only consider the production cost of tea in the Pingshui area, the cost of raw tea on the mountain, as well as the materials, factory rent, packaging, labor, and porterage, are all converted based on the price of rice. This year, the purchase price of raw tea per dan is equivalent to two stones of rice, while the cost of processing and packaging of boxed tea per dan is approximately equivalent to one stone and six dou of rice. The transportation cost from the production area to Shanghai, the export location, is equivalent to four dou of rice. All transportation, storage, loss, warehouse rent, insurance, and other costs after arriving in Shanghai are equivalent to four dou of rice. Furthermore, there are 45 days from the collection of raw materials to the processing of boxed tea to the export date to Shanghai, and another month for the mortgage of boxed tea at the export location, totaling 75 days. The loan interest and high interest rates borne by the self-funded portion are approximately equivalent to two stones of rice. Based on these few items, the estimated cost of tea per dan is approximately equivalent to six stones and four dou of rice. According to the government's highest tea loan amount of 10 million yuan per bundle, it is only equivalent to a few dou of rice, less than one-tenth of the cost. At this point, Sun strongly emphasized that if the tea loan amount cannot be increased, not only will production be stifled, but there will also be many misunderstandings in the international market, as the low loan amount makes it appear that the cost is not high, and it is impossible to sell at high prices overseas. Finally, Ye Shichang and Song Qifan spoke successively. Ye compared tea prices over the years, such as 1 billion capital could purchase 3,500 dan of tea in the 35th year, but last year it was reduced to 1,000 dan. This year, although there is 50 billion capital, it can only purchase 200 dan, demonstrating the vastness of the funds needed by tea merchants. Song reported on the current international market. The meeting dispersed at approximately 4 pm.</p>

<h3>Kunming Student Unrest Resolved Satisfactorily: Authorities Handling Aftermath</h3>

Chairman Lu personally visited the school on the afternoon of the 16th to speak with the students.

<h3>Visiting Jiaotong University: Acting President's Transfer Date Still to be Determined</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] Due to Mr. Li Zhaohuan's firm refusal to take office as President of National Jiaotong University, the Ministry of Education has appointed Wang Zhizhuo, Dean of the Engineering College, as acting president in the interim. Meanwhile, the Ministry and university alumni are still urging Mr. Li to assume the position as soon as possible. The Student Union recently sent three representatives with an official letter to his residence, urging him to come to the university to oversee affairs. However, all three attempts to meet with him were unsuccessful. Furthermore, a reporter interviewed Dean Wang Zhizhuo yesterday. According to him, although the Ministry of Education has announced his temporary appointment as acting president, he has not yet officially taken office. President Cheng Xiao left the university two weeks ago, and the date for the handover is yet to be negotiated and decided. At that time, the Ministry of Education will be requested to send personnel to Shanghai to supervise the transfer. The graduation ceremony for this year may not be held, as the ceremony is traditionally held before the vacation, and now that the vacation has already begun, some graduating students have already left the university. Therefore, whether or not to hold the ceremony is still under discussion with the professors. Contracts for the professors for the next semester will be issued after officially taking office. Regarding rumors circulating that the university is experiencing internal unrest due to the president's issue, Dean Wang stated that this is not the case. Currently, university affairs are being handled by the three departments of student affairs, academic affairs, and general affairs, and the university's operations are not affected.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper] The deadline for applications for new student admissions to Jiaotong University was yesterday, with an estimated total of over 7,000 applicants. The examination period will be from the 24th to the 28th of this month. Approximately 500 students will be admitted.</p>
<h3>Private Schools Not Yet Registered: Requesting Special Price Rice for Employees: Director Li's Request Submitted to the Mayor for Approval</h3>
<p>[Dahua News Agency] The Municipal Food Allocation Committee distributes special food rice to faculty and staff of private primary, secondary, and higher education schools, according to Article 37 of the implementation regulations, which is limited to those that have been officially registered. However, school registration requires three steps: "School Board Registration," "School Opening Approved," and "School Registration," which takes at least a year. Therefore, over 300 schools in this city have not completed the registration process. Since the announcement of these regulations, teachers in these schools have been affected in terms of rice allocation, and they have been requesting assistance from the Private Primary and Secondary School Association, etc. It is reported that yesterday morning (17th), Jiang Jizhou, Yan Guodong, Wang Weiqun, Wang Bing, Wang Jincheng, and others negotiated with Ren Xianqun of the Allocation Committee, and have obtained his agreement. However, it still requires Director Li of the Education Bureau to submit a request to the Mayor for approval. Furthermore, it is understood that Director Li has already submitted a request to the Mayor with the details. If accommodation is not possible, whether it can be limited to schools that have "School Opening Approved" will also depend on the City Government's decision.</p>
<h3>Candidates Face Food and Lodging Problems: Fudan and Other Schools Form Service Teams to Assist</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] Entrance examinations for public and private universities in the city have begun one after another. There are long queues at the registration locations of national universities, and the registration fees for each school are around one million, or even one and a half million, which candidates find to be a heavy burden. Candidates from other regions who have come to Shanghai from afar, and who do not have relatives or friends in Shanghai and are also financially strapped, can solve the food problem by eating flatbreads, but have nowhere to stay.</p>
<p>Jiaotong University Allows Accommodation for Candidates</p>
<p>This year, except for Jiaotong University which has been permitted to accommodate candidates, most other schools do not allow outsiders to stay. General impoverished candidates do not have money to stay in hotels, and some have to sleep in parks or small teahouses near schools with bedding. Every day they review their lessons and textbooks in such conditions to prepare for the exams, but their enthusiasm remains strong.</p>
<p>Fudan Registration Starts August 1st</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper] Fudan University has set the registration period for new student admissions from August 1st to 4th, and the examinations will be held in batches from August 10th to 12th.

Registration will begin on the 21st of this month, limited to one hundred people. Student organizations are not allowed to organize separately to reduce unnecessary disputes.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper] The Zheda Admissions Committee and the university's Student Union have set up a registration office and service station inside Shanghai Jiaotong University to facilitate candidates. They will begin operations on the 19th. Candidates going from Shanghai to Hangzhou to take the exams can first register at the Shanghai registration office and register with the service station.

<h3>University Special Interview Three: Private Guanghua University</h3>
<p>School History Overview: On June 3, 1925, nineteen Chinese faculty members and 553 students from St. John's University, due to the patriotic movement, left the school and jointly planned to establish their own university. Mr. Wang Shengshan generously donated over sixty acres of land on Daxilu Road in Shanghai as the school's foundation. Mr. Zhang Yongni and Mr. Zhu Jingnong raised funds and planned the curriculum. They rented houses on Avenue Joffre in the former French Concession as university buildings, and the junior high school buildings were located near Fenglin Bridge in the new west district. The school was named Guanghua. School opened on September 7th, with former St. John's students returning and new students rising up, and the university, established to reclaim educational rights, was thus established. Zhang Yongni was elected president, and Zhu Jingnong was elected provost. Four departments were established: liberal arts, sciences, commerce, and engineering. The following spring, construction of the school buildings began, and they were completed in the fall, with the university department moving in first. On June 1, 1929, the Ministry of Education approved its registration. In the fall of that year, in accordance with the organizational structure of universities promulgated by the Ministry, it was reorganized into three colleges: liberal arts, sciences, and commerce. In the spring of 1930, it began admitting female students.</p>
<p>Tenth Anniversary: In 1935, the tenth anniversary of the establishment of the school coincided with President Zhang's sixtieth birthday. Teachers, students, alumni, and enthusiastic people from all walks of life gathered large sums of money to build new school buildings to commemorate the occasion. There was a self-drilled artesian well, a self-provided power plant, and a sanatorium donated by the student association. The school's foundation was expanded to hundreds of acres. In 1937, the Sino-Japanese War broke out, and the school buildings were completely destroyed by the enemy on November 12th and 13th. Upon hearing the news, President Zhang personally stood by the Daxilu Railway and looked out at the flames, weeping for a long time. The school moved to a road-building area beyond the border, and then moved into the concession, continuing classes as usual. In 1938, Xie Lin, Dean of the College of Commerce, completed preparations for a branch school in Sichuan and opened it in Chengdu. The Sichuan Provincial Government and gentry merchants either allocated funds to subsidize construction costs or donated school land.</p>
<p>Difficult Times: In the fall of 1941, the Pacific War suddenly broke out. President Zhang knew that the enemy would intensify the pressure, so he decided to officially suspend the Shanghai school. On one hand, the Dean of the College of Liberal Arts and the heads of various departments organized a committee, and publicly elected Jiang Zhuzhuang, Dean of the College of Liberal Arts, to preside over the "Chengzheng Literary Society." The Deans of the Colleges of Science and Commerce and the heads of various departments organized a committee, and publicly elected Tang Qingzeng, Head of the Department of Economics, to preside over the "Gezhi Science and Commerce Society." The main faculty and staff of the affiliated high school organized a committee, and publicly elected Wu Xialing to preside over the "Renwu Tutoring Society." The three societies were registered with the Ministry of Education, and everything was handled in accordance with the Ministry's orders. Because there was no public recruitment, the number of students decreased year by year, and finances fell into dire straits. President Zhang, worried about the times and overworked, passed away in Shanghai on the 27th before the victory.</p>
<p>Before and After Reestablishment: When the Japanese invaders surrendered, Zhang Xinglian and Zhang Zhilian, sons of the late President Zhang, invited Vice President Zhu Jingnong and the main faculty and staff of the three societies to discuss the reestablishment of the school. Vice President Zhu was publicly elected as acting president. The school was officially reestablished in the Securities Building, and classes began on schedule. The board of directors was reorganized, and Weng Wenhao was publicly elected as chairman. The board of directors decided to return the branch school donated by the people of Sichuan to the people of Sichuan, renaming it "Chenghua University," and appointed Zhu Jingnong and Liao Maoru as presidents of the university and middle school respectively. On one hand, permission was obtained from the Ministry of Education to allocate the enemy property at Nos. 221 and 222 Ouyang Road, Hongkou, as school buildings and to move in for classes. President Zhu also resigned from his position as Vice Minister of Education and officially took office at the school.</p>
<p>Dean and Department Heads: Currently, the Deans and Department Heads of the various colleges and departments of the school are as follows: Dean of the College of Liberal Arts and concurrently Head of the Department of Chinese Literature Jiang Zhuzhuang, Head of the Department of Foreign Languages Zhou Xuliang, Head of the Department of Education Sun Guiding, Head of the Department of History Lu Simian, Head of the Department of Law Guo Yunquan, Head of the Department of Political Science Geng Danru, Head of the Department of Sociology Hu Zuyin. Dean of the College of Science Rong Qizhao, Head of the Department of Chemistry Shen Zhaowen, Head of the Department of Biology Wang Zhijia (Honorary Professor Bing Nongshan), Head of the Department of Mathematics and Physics Zhu Gongjin, Head of the Department of Civil Engineering Zhu Yongnian. Dean of the College of Commerce Cen Dezhang, Head of the Department of Economics Tang Qingzeng, Head of the Department of Accounting Xue Difu, Head of the Department of Banking He Yichao, Head of the Department of Business Administration Cai Zhengzhi.</p>

<h3>Olympic Torch Departs: Lit in the Ancient Temple of Olympia: Following 3,000-Year-Old Traditions</h3>
<p>[Reuters Athens, 17th] The Olympic torch is scheduled to be lit at noon on the 17th in the ruins of the ancient Temple of Hera in the ancient village of Olympia in southern Greece. At that time, the 3,000-year-old tradition will still be followed, with a Greek woman in white using olive branches under a magnifying glass to ignite the olive branches using the focus of sunlight, and then using the olive branches to light a cup-shaped oil lamp, and lighting the torch from the lamp. The lamp was originally stored in the Greek Archaeological Museum and will be sent to London after the torch is lit, where it will be presented to Princess Elizabeth by the Greek Olympic Committee. King Paul of Greece is currently touring the front lines and is unable to come to Olympia to participate in the lighting ceremony. The only people present are representatives of the Greek and British Olympic Committees. After the torch is lit, it will be relayed for 2,000 miles to Wembley, where it is scheduled to arrive on July 29th for the opening of the World Games. Due to the civil war, the first leg of the journey from Olympia to Katakolon Port will be shortened from 500 miles to 50 miles, from where it will be transported by the Greek destroyer Hastings to Corfu Island. On Sunday morning, Greek athletes from Corfu Island will hand it over to the British ship Whitesand Bay, which will sail to Bari, Italy, where it will be handed over to Italian athletes. In each country, the torch will be relayed by athletes from that country until it reaches Calais, France, where it will be handed over to the British destroyer Bicester for transport across the English Channel to Dover. Starting on the night of July 28th, 75 British athletes will each run two miles, and on the afternoon of the 29th, the torch will be relayed to Wembley, where the King of England will preside over the opening ceremony of the World Games.</p>

<h3>Tuition Calculated in Rice Value?</h3>
<p>— Ping Zhai</p>
<p>Today, the decline in the value of legal tender is an undeniable fact. However, no matter how low the value of legal tender falls, it is still the only legal currency in our country. Therefore, although there are many landlords in Shanghai who are unscrupulous and only want to calculate rent in gold bars or US dollars, they still dare not openly say in broad daylight that they do not want legal tender but want something other than legal tender.</p>
<p>Since the use of gold banknotes is a prohibited example, how can using "white rice" as a unit be considered legal!</p>
<p>However, rumors have been circulating recently that the tuition for some universities next semester will be five dan of rice, and some middle schools will be three dan of rice… A few days ago, a senior official of a certain university actually told reporters that the tuition for next semester will be calculated in rice value, saying that it will be five dan of medium-quality rice, and the words were quite certain, as if it were bound to happen.</p>
<p>If students live on campus and eat in the school, and the school, under the current special circumstances, asks students to hand over their household rice ration cards to the school, and the school charges students at the negotiated price for household rice every month, and the rice purchased is given to the students to eat, then it would be more understandable. However, if tuition and miscellaneous fees are all calculated in rice value, then whether parents can afford it is not the only question. What impact will this have on other industries? If the government allows schools to use something other than legal tender as a payment standard, then what if other industries follow suit? For example, if doctors charge two dou of medium-quality rice for each house call in the future, and cloth stores charge several sheng of medium-quality rice per foot when selling cloth, can the government still say that they are violating the law? At that time, if landlords calculate rent in dou or dan of rice, will it still be prohibited?</p>
<p>Of course, the lives of teachers in various schools are indeed extremely difficult at present, and we express our deepest sympathy. In all fairness, tuition should indeed be increased. However, calculating the value in rice is a very bad precedent that must not be set. The impact of this matter is enough to kill legal tender. This matter concerns the foundation of the country, and we ask teachers to think twice!</p>
<h3>Animal Languages</h3>
<p>— Guo Ping</p>
<p>Animals also have their own languages. Many animals "converse" using something like Morse code, while others use gestures or movements to express what they want to say in their hearts.</p>
<p>When a worker bee finds a flower full of honey, she quickly flies back to the hive and begins to perform a whirling dance in the center of the hive, happily reporting the good news. This dance, like language, tells the other worker bees, and they line up and fly eagerly to the flower patch to collect honey.</p>
<p>When a rabbit receives alarming news, it goes to the other rabbits and desperately thumps the ground with its hind legs to tell them.</p>
<p>Zoologists have proven that when a male wolf obtains a lot of food that it cannot finish eating, it buries the remaining food in the ground. As it sniffs the soil, it leaves a special scent, and the other wolves can find the food by this scent, which replaces language.</p>
<p>The way a male fiddler crab courts a female is quite similar to that of humans. When it encounters a female crab, it raises its large claw and waves it to greet her. If the female crab approaches it, it dances on its tiptoes and makes many different gestures with its large claw to express its intentions.</p>
<p>The way hummingbirds communicate with the opposite sex is quite poetic. When a male hummingbird sees a female, it flutters its wings and circles, flying in an arc in front of her. When the female hummingbird shows a little attention, the male hummingbird becomes enthusiastic and flies higher and higher. Finally, it soars into the sky with a cry, flying to a height of sixty feet, then suddenly descends and dances in front of the female hummingbird to win her favor.</p>
<p>In the tropics, there is a type of tree ant. Their "conversation" between one tree and another is indicated by the speed and strength of the sound they make by knocking on the trunk. Although the sound of the ants' feet is so faint that the human ear cannot hear it, they can hear each other.</p>
<p>A cow "speaks" by wiggling its ears.</p>
<p>We can say that all animal languages cannot escape the use of movements, smells, or faint sounds inaudible to the human ear. Some zoologists believe that this is what is called "Telepathy," but some experts believe that human senses are too dull to hear their "voices." Which is right and which is wrong remains to be proven by science in the future.</p>
<h3>"My Brother" and "Benevolent Brother"</h3>
<p>— You Mojun</p>
<p>"My Brother" and "Benevolent Brother" are common and frequently seen terms of address in letters. The usage of the two is slightly different: "Benevolent Brother" should be used to be more polite; conversely, if they are closer, then "My Brother" is often used. What I want to discuss now is the writing of the two characters "My Brother". According to our country's writing method, there is something called "jumping out", that is, commonly known as "raising the head," so as to express respect. "Brother" is a respectful term, so it should be written "jumping out", there is no doubt about it; but now, when writing, the character "My" is separated from the character "Brother", that is, the character "My" does not need to raise its head. This point is quite debatable.</p>
<p>The Preface to the Holy Teachings of the Monk Huai Ren Collected from Wang Xizhi's Writings and the Inscription of the Liquan Spring by Ouyang Xun are both commonly used posts for our calligraphy practice. In the sentence "My Emperor's blessings arrive" in the Preface to the Holy Teachings, the character "My" is written "jumping out"; in the sentence "My Queen firmly holds and moderates" and "My Queen is cautious in the evening" in the Inscription of the Liquan Spring, the two "My" characters are also written with their heads raised. The reason why the character "My" is written "jumping out" is because it is a term of close respect, not a self-designation of a subject; in the midst of respect, there is a sense of intimacy, and the writing is extremely appropriate. In the letters of modern people, when addressing "My Brother", the character "My" is forcibly split apart. People are accustomed to it and do not know that it is wrong. One can only say that it does not conform to the "ancient".</p>
<p>The title "Benevolent Brother" is indeed "ancient". The Biography of Zhao Yi in the Book of the Later Han Dynasty records a sentence in a letter answering Huangfu Gui: "I sincerely hope that Benevolent Brother will reveal his long delay." So this title already existed in the Han Dynasty.</p>
<h3>Ancient Meaning</h3>
<p>— Bi</p>
<p>Your home is at the head of Wu River, my home is in the outer city of Jinling, I always remember touring Jiangnan, and we were happy.</p>
<p>In Jiangnan, the lotus seeds can be picked, the lotus well is red and bright, picking lotus seeds and not picking lotus leaves, the leaves are a mandarin duck curtain.</p>
<p>On the curtain, the autumn wind is born, under the dew, the green branches fall, when the branches fall, the silk is still connected, when the person leaves, the heart is entrusted.</p>
<p>Entrusting each other, the river water is long, seeing each other off, the wind and waves are evil, one word to give to you, the heart is bitter and difficult to make medicine!</p>
<p>Second</p>
<p>Leisurely white clouds gallop, dimly flying crows pass by, the birds pass by and still leave sound, the clouds leave and do not look back.</p>
<p>Looking back is also difficult to see, seeing each other is in dreams, dense rain falls and forms a river, in which there are tears in dreams.</p>
<p>What if the tears run out! Blood drips onto the soil under the steps. Take the soil and make a plate, make it your rouge mansion.</p>
<p>Look at the red on your cheeks in the morning, and as red on your cheeks in the evening, morning after morning and evening after evening, I only see a good complexion.</p>
<h3>"Grabbing a Seat"</h3>
<p>— Yi Jun</p>
<p>I have played many games at various social gatherings at school, and "grabbing a seat" is one of them. The way this game is played is this: arrange the seats in a circle. Assuming there are twenty people participating, there will only be nineteen or eighteen seats. When the whistle blows, everyone leaves their seat. When the whistle blows again, everyone grabs a seat to sit in. As a result, of course, one or two people will definitely not be able to grab a seat.</p>
<p>The job-seeking phenomenon in society now is simply like the game of "grabbing a seat." The number of "seats" in society is very limited and has already been fully occupied. There are still many people waiting beside them; graduates from schools come out, running around and getting frustrated, getting their heads broken and bleeding. If they want to grab an empty seat, they must have great skills, so most people cannot get a seat.</p>
<p>The game of "grabbing a seat" is, after all, a game; if you can't grab a seat, you just stand for a while. To be more harsh, you just have to sing a song or tell a joke, so that "everyone is happy," which is a pleasure. But "grabbing a seat" when looking for a job is not fun. If you can't grab a seat, you will be punished to perform "being a Yangmei," making you unable to support your parents and unable to raise your wife and children, causing pain to your loved ones and making your enemies happy.</p>
<p>In the game of "grabbing a seat", there is only one seat missing, at most two, so only a few one or two people cannot grab a seat; but when looking for a job, there are too many seats missing, and there are very few empty seats, so most people cannot grab a seat, and most of them. In the game of "grabbing a seat", the number of people does not increase, but in "grabbing a seat"-style job seeking, the number of people increases in large numbers year after year. The fewer the seats, the more new opponents increase, the more difficult it is to grab a seat.</p>
<p>Sometimes when you ask someone to recommend you for a job, they say, "Wait for an opportunity!" The meaning is: wait for an empty seat! But you are not the only one waiting for this seat to be empty, so even if God helps you, only one of you can grab the seat that you are all waiting for, and the rest will inevitably wait in vain. What's worse, the seat you're waiting for may not even become empty, so you can't grab it either. I have had such experiences several times from Jing'an Temple to the end of North Sichuan Road by tram: when I got on the tram, I didn't grab a seat, so I stood by a person who was sitting, preparing to replace him when he got off halfway, but after passing many stations along the way, seats on the left and right were emptied and grabbed by others, but only the person whose seat I was waiting for firmly held his seat and did not move until he got off at the end of North Sichuan Road. As a result, I waited in vain. The same is true when looking for a job, but the danger is even greater.</p>
<p>"Grabbing a seat" in a game is just grabbing an empty seat. If you can't grab it, you just give up. But in the job-seeking situation, it's not that simple. When grabbing, there is inevitably a fierce battle. After grabbing, those who can't grab a seat may squeeze those "occupied seats", so those who squeeze and those who are squeezed will inevitably fight in a group, twist into a pile, fight a big battle, and harm each other, and evolve into the so-called "man-made disaster".</p>
<p>There are two major problems in society today: one is the price problem, and the other is the "seat" problem; when prices stop rising and no one is grabbing for seats, there will probably be no more serious problems.</p>
<h3>Miscellaneous Talks on Couplets</h3>
<p>— Jianqiu</p>
<p>The creation of couplets can be either magnificent or delicate. Although the approaches are different, neither should be neglected. Here are a few examples to substantiate this discussion.</p>
<p>Mr. Han Guojun's couplet mourning his second son reads: "To despise one's own life and cause sorrow to one's parents is called unfilial; having mourned your brother, now I see your death, what home do I have?" Each word is a tear, making it unbearable to finish reading. His son indulged in pleasure and extravagance, and one night, he was careless with wine, fell from a building, and died. Master Zi cried bitterly, and his true feelings were revealed, so he was unaware of his grief.</p>
<p>The Ping Shan Tang in Yangzhou has a couplet collected from the works of Song Dynasty writers: "Embracing distant mountains and swallowing the Yangtze River (Fan Zhongyan), among the southwestern peaks, the forests and valleys are especially beautiful (Ouyang Xiu); Sending off the setting sun and welcoming the bright moon (Wang Yuzhi), at the turn of spring and summer, the grass and trees reach the sky (Su Shi)." It is casually picked up and perfectly seamless. It is a fine structure, as the saying goes, "a robe patched with a thousand armpits, obliterating all traces of thread."</p>
<p>The couplet for the "Autumn Moon over the Peaceful Lake" in West Lake reads: "Coming through the curtains, the clear wind in summer and the sun in winter; Seeing each other with rolled up curtains, the bright moon in front and the mountains behind." It deliberately repeats, but it does not feel redundant. It also shows wisdom.</p>
<h3>Stories Inspired by the Yan Peixing Case</h3>
<p>— Diao Ying</p>
<p>The Yan Peixing case has suddenly become silent and without substance, and everyone is inexplicably confused as to whether he is really crazy. A story recorded in an American magazine is somewhat similar to the Yan case:</p>
<p>There was an American businessman who was old but married a young and beautiful wife. The wealthy businessman suspected his wife of infidelity, but she flatly denied it. One day, the wealthy businessman was extremely busy with business affairs and was exhausted when he returned home. Unexpectedly, his wife brought in a doctor, insisted that he was in poor health, and wanted him to have a blood test. As soon as the doctor performed the operation, the wealthy businessman fainted.</p>
<p>When he woke up, he was in a private mental hospital, not allowed to see visitors. He argued to get out, but the hospital ignored him. He was locked up for twenty-seven months in a row!</p>
<p>But the wealthy businessman's nephew became suspicious. He hired a lawyer to go to the mental hospital and ask to see the businessman. Unexpectedly, he went more than fifty times and still could not see him. The lawyer was filled with righteous indignation, so he asked a political figure for help. Unexpectedly, the hospital still ignored him when the political figure went. Finally, they took a court summons to "summon" the "madman," and only then did they finally meet him—of course, the "madman" had only been given an anesthetic injection that day, and had no mental illness at all!</p>
<p>As a result, it was found that the director of the mental hospital and the doctor had both been bribed, and the wealthy businessman's wife's intentions were naturally revealed. They were all sentenced to the crimes they deserved. This type of criminal case is actually quite common. When sentencing, the doctor's crime is often the most serious (because he insisted that a perfectly healthy person had a mental illness), and the fines often exceed $10,000.</p>
<h3>Guangdong and Guangxi</h3>
<p>— Gongsun Wu</p>
<p>Someone asked a Cantonese person, what is the meaning of "Guang" in Guangdong and Guangxi? It is easy to understand Hunan and Hubei, Shandong and Shanxi. The Cantonese person did not know how to answer. I said to him, why not ask back about the origin of Jiangxi's name? Try to look at a map. The entire Jiangxi province is indeed south of the great river. Both matters are easy to understand. Gu Yanwu's Daily Knowledge Records explains the reason, saying, "In the twenty-first year of the Kaiyuan era of the Tang Dynasty, the world was divided into fifteen circuits, and Jiangnan was divided into two circuits, Jiangnan East Circuit governed Suzhou, and Jiangnan West Circuit governed Hongzhou. Later generations simplified the writing and only called them Jiangdong and Jiangxi." Today, the name Jiangdong has been abandoned. Elementary school textbooks say that Jiangsu Province is named after the old Jiangning and Suzhou. As for Guangdong and Guangxi, Gu said, "The Guangdong and Guangxi of today are also the simplified names of Guangnan East Circuit and Guangnan West Circuit. Wenxian Tongkao says that in the third year of the Zhidao era of Emperor Taizong, the world was divided into fifteen circuits, and later three circuits were added. The seventeenth was Guangnan East Circuit, and the eighteenth was Guangnan West Circuit." This is also exam material and should be printed in exam guides and other materials.</p>
<p>###</p>
<p>Brother Jingzhai wrote: Ying Guoboyue, together with Mr. Canweng and Mr. Qian, went to Suzhou to survey Feng Shui. He also said that Mr. Banmeng used his fortune telling to predict that his life would end at sixty-eight years old, which is this year, Wuzi, and he intends to enter the mountains to seek supreme bliss and write a poem to bid farewell to his colleagues. Jingzhai's reply chapter has the line (Why bother to ask for longevity in the Zinian year? Living in a clean studio far away is enough for a sound sleep). According to general precedents, a twilight mood is either for self-entertainment in one's old age or for arranging one's affairs after death, all of which are common sense. Most of the wise men of the past were like this. However, astrologers often calculate the flowing years and take the ages around seventy as the norm for dealing with worldly affairs. Moreover, there are alarming words that cannot be verified. For example, in the chronicle poem of Zhou Guanyu, Yu Shanfu of Jiande (the Viceroy of Liangjiang in the 31st and 2nd year of the Guangxu era of the Qing Dynasty), which records his fifty-second year, Wuzi, when he returned to Zheng from his post as Judge of Zhili to visit his relatives, he wrote a poem saying: "The fortune teller said that I would live to seventy-two years old, and at noon on the twenty-fourth of April, I would bid farewell to the world. How dare I believe these words? Longevity and brevity are all destined. I lament my meager talents, and I only bear the burden of wasting time. I have no intention of pursuing fame and fortune, and nine out of ten things are hindered. What is the use of living twenty more years?" He also said: "I am not yet called an old man at fifty, and the vicissitudes of life are like a reversal. I sigh that my books have been presented repeatedly, and my ambition to retire has not been realized. I dare not covet glory and profit, and I know enough to maintain loyalty and honesty. I vow to return as a senior scholar when I reach the Jiawu year." When he wrote the poem, he considered seventy as "living twenty more years", and he was content with retiring at sixty. Who would have thought that this old gentleman would live to eighty-five years old and pass away in his residence in Tianjin in the tenth year of the Republic of China (Xinyou), more than ten years beyond the number calculated by the fortune teller! Then, are the so-called predictions of passing away on a certain day, month, year, and time all old rumors? Old Zhou's collection of poems is a chronicle of events, all expressed in poetry, so it is a "poetic chronicle". By the time of Yi Si (the first year of the Xuantong era of the Qing Dynasty), there was a title "The Night of April 24th", with a footnote saying: "In the past, a fortune teller said that I would pass away at the age of seventy-two, at noon on the twenty-fourth of April. It was not verified last year, Wushen, and I was worried that this year, Jiyou, I would reach my full term. So I made a playful inscription at night and wrote a poem: "The white egret has already been met and has not stopped its whip, Heaven has given me Qingguan and more years. In my dreams, the vicissitudes of life have changed through thousands of kalpas, and a star hangs in the remaining clouds and mists of the night. Ruan Fu will light the wax to visit the mountains, and Tao Ling still ploughs and plants fields. The grass laughs at the old man for having no desires, and he wants to bathe in the river and become an immortal." He is also doing his best to enjoy his old age, which is the immortal of this world. Is there really a Zhong Lü who can save people? Old Zhou is a truly enlightened man. (Old Zhou's previous work was in Wuzi, which is the 14th year of the Guangxu era of the Qing Dynasty. Banmeng felt the same and wrote the same poem this year, Wuzi, which is also a coincidence.) Zhou's fourth son, Zhou Xuezhao, whose courtesy name is Jizhi, was a Juren in the Gui Si year. He was promoted by the old Yuan in the Qing Dynasty and served as the Director-General of Transport in the Changlu Salt District. In the early years of the Republic of China, he was the Minister of Finance of the Yuan government and was highly trusted. After retiring, he engaged in industry and commerce in Tianjin. In the year before the victory, he and his wife celebrated their eightieth birthdays together and wrote poems to celebrate their golden wedding (60 years of marriage). Last year, his wife passed away first, and a few months later, Jizhi followed her, returning with white hair, and both he and his father were blessed with longevity.</p>
