<p>〔本報徐州廿三日電〕陳匪殘餘主力，廿三日分自碾莊，大許家間向西南　蕭方向逃竄。</p>
<p>〔本報蚌埠廿三日電〕據某高級將領告記者，我大兵團之北進增援，徐州東綫局面卽可開朗，此為徐州會戰中第二回合之開始，國軍可在此階段內續收豐碩戰果，穩定大局。按黃兵團苦守碾莊，至廿一日共匪以密集火網對黃兵團猛擊，發砲達萬餘發之多，碾莊據點工事摧毀殆盡，黃兵團乃轉移至碾莊東北某陣地，繼續吸引匪之主力，予以聚殲。</p>
<p>〔中央社徐州廿三日電〕國軍強大空軍，廿三日續飛徐州東翼作戰，當配合地面部隊攻克東距徐州卅餘公里處大許家兩側之前後王莊，前後火神廟，韓莊，孫莊，灘頭等地，並在碾莊南方孫家莊，張莊，西張莊及曹八集西北三公里之曹家倉房，湖城圩，炸斃潛伏工事內匪甚多。</p>
<p>〔中央社徐州廿三日電〕空軍廿三日下午在靈璧西北廿公里之睢河兩岸，發現股匪正在集結，又在宿縣近郊發現匪二千餘南竄，當予猛烈轟炸及低飛掃射，據悉：共斃匪二千餘。</p>
<p>〔本報蚌埠廿三日電〕前方廿三日午急電，我黃維兵團廿二日抵宿縣西南卅華里之南平集，李延年兵團抵西寺坡南之龍王廟，由徐州南下之孫元良兵團抵夾溝以南地區後，廿三日晨三路大軍同時向宿縣行動，由黃·李兩兵團對宿縣當面之劉匪三·九兩縱隊展開攻擊，迫近該地，孫·李·黃三大兵團卽可會師。中斷十日之徐·蚌段交通，日內當可打通，殘匪大部西竄，我正分兵進剿，擴大戰果中。</p>

<h3 id="c2">碾莊附近督戰受傷　周志道軍長抵京　定今日乘專機飛滬治療 <a href="#c2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>〔中央社南京廿三日電〕徐州會戰中，於碾莊附近負傷之國軍某軍軍長周志道將軍，廿三日自徐飛抵京，周軍長左臂·右腿於親臨前綫督戰時被擊中負傷，雖連日作戰備極辛勞，復經飛行，然精神極佳，周軍長抵京後，卽由親友陪送返寓休息，定廿四日專機飛滬治療。</p>
<p>〔中央社徐州廿三日電〕匪於一再宣傅被俘之國軍某軍軍長周志道，今晨自碾莊過徐，專機飛京就醫，劉總司令派郭一予主任代表至機塲歡送。周氏係廿日晚自碾莊抵徐，據護衛周軍長安全來徐之璩振玉營長稱：本軍在碾莊主力戰中，係祖任西綫，自十日夜開始戰鬥以來，每晚匪必有十波（按匪衝鋒係用波浪式，每一次卽為一波）以上之衝鋒，故每晚陣前匪屍堆積如山，戰事之慘烈，可以想見。迄匪被擊敗退後，始奉黃丘團司令官之命，護送周軍長來徐。當前綫激戰時，匪常利用小型廣播電台，在陣前喊話，並迭謠某某陣亡，某某負傷，本軍屢聞其播稱：周軍長志通重傷殞命，周氏當時實親臨陣地督戰。又於十七日廣播周軍長被俘，而匪之此種煽惑伎倆，是證匪方廣播之虛偽狂妄而已。</p>

<p>〔本報北平廿三日電〕保定各校學生隨軍沿平保路北上，廿三日大部已安抵涿縣，廿四日可全部到達，轉來北平，冀教廳已為彼等覓定住所。</p>

<h3 id="c14">克拉克接見美記者　談全力援華計劃　主動用太平洋美軍火接濟我國 <a href="#c14" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e14" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">14</a></h3>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓廿二日電〕最近訪問亞洲歸來之參院撥款委員會顧問克拉克，廿二日接見合衆社記者時稱：渠個人主張全力援華，并相信全力援華可挽救中國政府。按克氏在廿一日發表之正式報告中曾謂，是否全力援華之眞正決定須由美政府決定，而非由渠決定。</p>
<p>克氏鄭重指出，本日所發表者乃根據渠代該委會研究中國情勢時觀察所得之個人意見。渠稱渠之信念乃根據下列三因數：（一）由美官員嚴格監督之美國軍事援助，可有效遝用中國「幾無限制之人力」。渠建議一項訓練計劃，由美軍官監督各師及監督各師之參加戰略。（二）經濟援助將穩定中國之幣制及鞏固中國經濟之基礎。（三）美國現存在太平洋方面之軍事配備幾可立卽應用，此等軍事配備在此緊急時間對中國政府有無上價值，動用此等配備須由華府下令。</p>
<p>克拉克復稱：渠相信全力援華並不較空運接濟柏林，援助希臘，或援歐計劃更具戰爭性，亦並不較蘇聯在軍事上及經濟上援助波蘭，阿爾巴尼亞，保加利亞及捷克等各衛星國事更具戰事性。克氏繼稱：「據余個人之見，大量與有效之美援以支持素對吾人如此友善之中國政府，性質僅與歐洲之馬歇爾計劃相同，馬歇爾計劃旨在制止共產主義而已。故問題僅在程度而不在性質。」</p>
<p>克拉克繼稱，渠在訪華時曾與蔣總統會晤，深為蔣總統所感動。「余深信不論發展如何，渠將作戰到底。余相信在原則上渠腦際絕無妥協一念存在，因此渠將作戰到底而決不投降。渠為專心之愛國者，決不在壓力下放棄。余相信如不遭日本侵略，蔣總統將完成中國之統一。」</p>

<p>雖然蔣總統已呼籲美國援華，但一般認為行政當局尙不致立卽採取任何對付中國共產黨進展之積極性措施。熟悉局勢之官員列舉之因素如下：（一）美國在亞洲之外交政策，必須由高級官員重加檢討，在檢討中一切在亞洲具有戰略利益之友好政府之觀點均將計及。（二）對中共自東北進攻華北之局勢，必須重加估定，以決定中國是否能藉大量之美國經濟及軍事援助而獲救。（三）美國在歐洲及中國之利益，必須縝密權衡，以決定美國是否能有效地擴展杜魯門主義至中國。（四）必須與國會領袖會商，以確定渠等對華之觀點，以及在下年度國會中可能產生之任何擴大援助計劃。在檢討對華政策中必須提前考慮者，為蔣總統要求美國宣佈同情，共同一致及支持中國政府之政策，以加强士氣。</p>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓廿三日電〕消息靈通人士今日稱：杜魯門總統與馬歡爾國務卿昨夜曾商議援華辦法，總統亟欲有所決定，以便詳細答覆蔣總統要求美國擴大援助之迫切呼籲，總統與馬卿討論兩大重心為：（一）此際援助中國政府是否己太晚？（二）適當援華計劃之經費能否列入預算，而不使國庫虧蝕。聞政府一部份官員正在考慮五十億元之援助計劃，但此種計劃之年限並未決定，故每年之援助數目，未可臆測。</p>

<h3 id="c18">建立幣信與維持債信 <a href="#c18" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e18" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">18</a></h3>
<p>政府與人民之間的關係，也正和人與人之間的關係一樣，是建立在一個「信」字上面的。因此，無論古今中外，一個良好的政府，總以建立威信為先務，要使人民對它發生信仰，才能鞏固它的政治基礎。我們所騐知的商君徙木立信的故事，便是一個最好的明證。「得民者昌，失民者亡」，這兩句話，實在是千古　撲不破的眞理；而所謂得失的關鍵，也就是這個「信」的存亡而已。幾千年前，我們的政治思想家已經在大聲疾呼「民無信不立」了。</p>
<p>近二十年來，政府在各方面的一切措施，失信於人民的次數，實在是太多了，其結果無可諱言的，政府的威信，一天天的低落。但是在挽回威信惟恐不及的時候，却不料又來了一套王雲五氏的「八一九」改革幣制。在實施之初，政府也和歷次一樣，重申大信於天下。財政當局看到人民在甘言和嚴刑的雙重策誘之下，把金銀外幣爭先恐後的送進中央銀行，未嘗不疇躇滿志，自慶成功。但是，曾幾何時，却鬧得全國各地，生產萎縮，經濟斷流，人心惶惶，造成空前的嚴重局面。政府事前既毫無準備，於是病急亂投方，時而補充，時而修正，口血未乾，前言盡食，幾乎把人民的信心喪失乾淨。其結果更影響到軍事方面，東北棄守，江淮震動，使國本幾乎為之動搖。這種慘痛的經騐，應該是一個寳貴的教訓。</p>
<p>現在，王雲五氏已經是一走了事，改革幣制也從「祇許成功」拖到「意料失敗」而結束。過去的事，本來不足深論；不過，人民自從抗戰以來，十餘年中，無日不受着幣制動盪的損害，這次尤其是創鉅痛深。要收拾人心，挽回威信，對於與民生關係最切的貨幣問題，政府實有痛改過去的因循反覆的政策的必要。新任財長徐堪，受命於艱危之際，宣佈今後的財政措施，首卽揭　重建幣信，我們認為這是明智而切要之舉。據中央銀行公佈國庫現存黃金五百萬市兩，銀元一億元，估計可收兌金圓券一百二十億元。這時候來談重建幣信，尙未至事不可為之時，但只要看政府今後的決心如何而定了。</p>
<p>第一，要建立幣信，則今後一切財政經濟的措施，必需顧及人民的利益，才能挽回人民的信心。遠者不具論，卽以這次改幣來說，政府實施的基本動機，只在於解救財政危機。因此，其實施辦法，只顧到為政府廣開財源：一面在便利通貨之大量膨脹，一面在設法詐取人民的金銀儲藏，一切只在便利政府，絲毫不曾顧慮到人民的利益，七十天的暴風雨之後，人民遭受了慘重的損失，而暫時受益的倒是政策失敗的政府本身。這種不顧國計民生的措施，只有逼着人民更堅決的走上「重物輕幣」的路上，要求鞏固幣信，無異南轅北轍。又如改幣失敗以後，政府種種補充修正的辦法，仍不免忽略了大部份人民的利益，反使少數旣得利益的人佔了便宜，也是有背建立幣信的方針的。</p>
<p>第二，要建立幣信，則今後一切財政經濟的措施要有縝密配合的計劃。貨幣問題是與整個財政經濟的發展相聯繫着，決不能把它孤立以求解決。因此，要建立幣信，同時對於國際貿易的調整，生產事業的獎勵，物資供應的調節，物價工資的穩定，國庫收支的平衡，以及最急要的通貨發行的控制等問題，都須於事先有通盤的策劃，決不可再像這次改幣一般，臨時頭痛醫頭，只一味的求助於武斷的政治壓力，反而責備人民不信任金圓券。徐財長招待記者時說得好：「政府今後的一切措施，總要對得起人民，事先要愼重考慮，決不出爾反爾」，我們希望這將不再是一張不兌現的支票！</p>
<p>此外與建立幣信有連帶關係的，還有一個維持債信的問題。如所週知，一班的財政學者都以為發行公債是較徵稅妥善的一種財政政策，因為徵稅的對象是一般人民，而募債則是以吸收人民的有餘財富來彌補國庫的赤字。但是募債是不能用強制手段的，其成功與否，有賴於一種類似商業上的信用的建立，必須政府取得人民的信仰。過去政府的公債政策，已經屢次失信於人民，但是人民總是抱着「以觀後效」的心理，還是盡力的擁護，其後因為幣制貶值的加連，政府為吸誘人民購債的與趣，曾發行多種外幣公債。發行之初，政府也曾屢次聲明要盡力維持債權人的利益·但是事過境遷，政府幾番的修正補充以後，　只國到本身的利益而把人民忘掉了。這次徐財長的招待會中曾有記者提出政府如何維持債信的問題，徐氏的答覆是：「補救辦法可做一分總做到一分」。我們對於徐氏的的尙欠懇切的答覆，頗表遺憾。政府如果有誠意要恢復和維持債信，就應把過去所發行的公債通盤整理一下，法幣公債最低限度應以同值的金圓劵重發新債，美金公債仍應繼續有效，美金庫券也應按照發行的條款還本付息；而且公債旣是政府所發行，就應允許銀錢業承受抵押以利週轉，若是美金公債，更應允許持有人充作子女教育費用，如此則人民對於公債，纔能恢復信心。此後政府如有緩急之需，旣不應靠增發通貨以自已破壞幣信，還可繼續發行以資挹注。因此我們希望在考慮如何重建幣信的時候，不要忽略了這互相關聯的重要的一環。</p>
<p>政府屢次所作的諾言落空，實在太多了，人民是久已厭聞了。「為政不在多言」，徐財長在記者招待會中聲言：「如本人今後有違反諾言，請各位儘量指摘批評」。我們但願徐氏受指摘批評的情事不再發生，因為指摘批評已經不足以挽救這不絕如縷的人民的信心和千鈞一髮的國家的命運了。</p>

<p>不論宣傳的技巧如何，事實終勝於雄辯，共匪一再宣傳的主題，不外說政府「壓迫」人民，共匪則為「解放者」，但中國人民對匪徒殘暴的本能的反感，已足嚴厲駁斥此種宣傳的虛妄，今天成千累萬的人民，巳經或正從匪區逃到政府的轄區中來，人民當必明白，誰是眞正的「解放者」。</p>
<p>你們勢必要問我，美國對於處此危機中的中國政府，能作如何的援助呢？我想告訴各位，除開過去你們業已給予中國的慷慨而令人感謝的援助之外，援助的方法與方式，必須由你們自己去決定的。我唯一要告訴各位的，是未來的任何援助，必須立刻見諸實現，如果共產主義在中國得逞，你們最後也必難倖免，因為中國戰略地位給共匪掌握以後，你們本身的力量，亦大大削弱了。中國萬一淪亡，整個亞洲亦必隨之覆滅，此外，亞洲對於世界和平的重要性，當然並不次於歐洲。</p>
<p>我知道，美國一部份人士認為，中國對於美國並非必須也不重要，因為美國在日本已經有了立足點，這裏我想給你們指出一個事實，廣大的中國大陸，倘若給敵人奪佔以後，曝露於敵前的日本島嶼，勢必祗是美國一個脆弱的前哨而已，這並不是片面的論調，你們不妨請教貴國駐日的軍事人員。</p>
<p>你們中間，倘有任何人依然懷着希望，以為組織所謂聯合政府，俾能與共匪締造和平，那末我請他仔細推敲，中共匪首毛澤東，最近於共產國際情報局機關雜誌上發表的那篇論文，該文曾由共匪電臺，於十一月六日廣播，本人現將其中數段引述於后：</p>
<p>「第二次世界大戰勝利以後，代替法西斯德·義·日的地位，而瘋狂地準備新的世界戰爭，威脅全世界的美國帝主義及其在各國的走狗們，反映了資本主義世界的極端腐敗及其瀕於滅亡的恐怖情緒……</p>
<p>每一個國家內部的一切革命力量……必須互相團結起來，組成以蘇聯為首的反對帝國主義的統一戰綫，並遵循正確的政策」。</p>
<p>當毛匪澤東勢力薄弱的時候，他的一些美籍辯護者勸他偽裝中共祗是一個農民黨，現在他自以為勝利在望，就揭開假面具，率直承認他是一個澈底的共黨主義者，不僅視中國政府為敵人，且將美國也當做主要的敵人了。假使他現時顛覆政府的企圖與野心得逞，他的最後目標如何，想美國人不難明瞭了吧。</p>
<p>一九四三年二月十八日，當我們共同抵禦暴日威脅時，我曾在美國國會發表過一次演講，那次演講中，有一節言詞最足說明在今天這個緊要關頭，鼓起我們敵愾精神的一點眞理，此刻不妨重來引述。</p>
<p>我們中國人民也像你們一樣，不僅為了我們本身，而且也為了全人類，需要一個更完美的世界，我們必須達到這個目的，然而僅僅宣示這種理想，甚或自以為已經具備了這種理想，都是不够的。為了要保持和維護這種理想，我們有時必須竭盡我們所有，努力求其實現，卽使冒失敗的危險，也在所不惜，我們中國人民深信，冒險作光榮的奮鬥，比卑怯地自認失敗，實為睿智。</p>
<p>這種精神，在抗戰最危急的時期，曾經支持過我們，今天也同樣的正在鼓舞着我們，今天的剿匪戡亂，乃是我們過去八年遙長艱苦的抗戰的延長，不過像一本書的另展新章而已，不管變化如何，不管人民與國家將受到怎樣的困苦與荼毒，我們這次的戰鬥，必會像抗日勝利一樣地重獲勝利，因為先後兩次奮鬥的目標是相同的。</p>
<p>美國許多眞誠的友人，在我們艱苦困頓之中，一向相信着我們，我願借今天這個機會，表示中國永恒的謝意</p>

<p>〔聯合社巴黎廿三日電〕聯合國大會美國代表團今日發表聲明，重申美國希望安理會解決柏林問題之立塲，以駁斥柏林方而所傳美國權成人士認為柏林問題無法協議之消息。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社巴黎廿三日電〕據此間英美人士方面今晨透露三強對勃拉馬格里亞之覆文現巳草就，今日下午或卽可提出。蘇聯之覆文巳提交與聯合國秘書處，聞蘇聯之熊度並無改變。美國人士雖對於柏林問題不直接表示悲觀，然表示對於柏林貨幣問題，四強問獲致協議殊屬不可能。又稱，西方三強目前主要之努力，係自動覓取一項財政方案，在將來之時又不受蘇聯之欺騙。</p>
<p>〔合衆社巴黎廿二日電〕英法代表意見仍歧異，西方盟國答覆柏林幣制問題之覆文因而尙需遷延。安理會主席阿根廷外長勃拉馬格里亞重新企求解決柏林危機而提出此項問題。蘇聯現已提出覆文，但美代表傑塞普·英代表賈德幹·及法代表巴洛迪廿一晚會商覆文時，在措詞方面意見不能一致。彼等將再行會議，希望屆時能完成覆文，蓋歧見在性質上比較次要。英美法三國對聯合國解決柏林糾紛之一切努力雖加合作，但彼等之代表等均表悲觀。預料四強中均無改變立塲以獲致協議之跡象。</p>
<h3 id="c42">貝那多特計劃爲基礎　阿猶試談判劃界　澳代表向政治委會建議 <a href="#c42" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e42" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">42</a></h3>
<p>〔合衆社巴黎二十三日電〕澳代表荷特廿三日建議聯大及早批准以色列加入聯合國，並允許以色列國與阿拉伯國家直接談判，自由商定雙方最後疆界。荷特在聯大政委會中提出上項建議，渠主張聯合國僅能派遣一小型之調解委會，協助阿猶直接談判，如雙方不能達成協議，則聖地之最後疆界問題，應再行提交下屆大會，作最後決定。</p>
<p>此項提議顯然表示澳洲與英國在巴勒斯坦問題上之重要政策之分歧。荷特在解釋澳洲建議之演辭中稱，阿猶雙方之直接談判，甚至可能立刻於巴黎舉行，而由聯合國加以監督。渠強調聯合國在去年十一月通過之聖地分治計劃，應作為阿猶談判之「基本開始點」。渠稱，聯合國不能放棄分治計劃。</p>
<p>阿拉伯代表以退會始威脅</p>
<p>埃及代表安特斯朋立卽以埃及退出為威脅，假使以色列國為聯合國之一員。埃及代表稱當一個人被選為一個總會會員時，而此一會員為某一部份會員所不喜者，此時某一部份會員惟一可做之事厥為退出，此亦吾人所唯一可循之路。至於安特斯朋所言者，是否為埃及一國，抑為阿拉伯全體國家而發者，尙無明顯表示。七阿拉伯國家時常七位一體而行動，尤其對於巴勒斯坦問題。就一般而言，埃及在聯大中曾率領阿拉伯國家，敘利亞在安理會為阿拉伯國家發言。</p>
<p>美對英建議將提出修正案</p>
<p>同時美官員已完成重要之修正案，以圖緩和英國在政委會提出之巴勒斯坦建議。官方稱，修正案將由美代表傑塞普在廿三或廿四日提出。按英國之提案要求支持貝那杜特計劃，將尼基夫區劃歸阿拉伯，西伽勒利區劃歸猶太。官方稱，美國之修正案將建議通過聯合國特種斡旋委員會，以貝那杜特計劃為根據，鼓勵阿猶直接談判，以商定渠等之領土協議，而避免由聯大之決議而將若干條款，加於雙方。官方並強調，美國之修正案係與英巴勒斯坦問題專家取得協議者。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕前水上警察分局局長張人佑等九人，被訴貪汚凟職一案，地院郭祖幹推事，昨日下午開庭再審。關於張人佑被控籍端勒索財物部份，傅到新福申輪船公司經理伍德麟述稱：該公司輪船於本年三月十六日，因輪上絞關損壞，木料墮下，發生壓斃小工楊淸家事後，水上分局拘訊輪機長王文高，渠卽派該公司總務主任郭良楨，往局探間，結果經將王郭兩人保釋，直接付給楊濟家家屬卹金法幣一億八千萬元，及律師證明費五百萬元，該小工家屬，遂向水上分局自動撤回告訴，成立和解，此外，未向其他方面付款。</p>
<p>浮報柴油七百介侖</p>
<p>庭上次詢證人陳紹錫（前水上分局總務股員），就被告張人佑，黃伯謙等侵占公有財物部　答　：在局專司辦理燃料，槍彈，被服等收發報銷事宜，該局所有八號汽艇一艘，於今年三月八日被海關輪隻撞毀停駛，張局長到任獲悉後，曾致函交涉。而該艇所用柴油，奉黃股長之命，仍如前虛報，當時渠雖知為肅報，惟係奉股長命，故無奈何。虛報之油，於每日下班後，卽將油庫開匙，交付他人保管，是否盜賣，則不知情，後經人密報，張局長乃令黃股長設法向總局更正，黃股長稱柴油漏筒甚多，浮糧乃所以彌補消耗？短短兩月內，浮報數達七百一十加侖。此外今年四五月間，因案存局之贓煤，忽亦不知移往何處。後據調查，係黃股長出賣，得款分渠三百萬元，渠拒絕接受。</p>
<p>改處罰金未送總局</p>
<p>關於談文喜等美金交易，張人佑被控凟職，隱匿不究部份，證人沈煥領（前水上分局第一股長）供稱：百樂汽車行在外灘十號碼頭，違章建築木亭，經營美軍出差業務，經該局羅巡官查辦，渠以其所擬處分太輕，乃另簽意見，擬拘留二日示儆，關於美金交易部份，擬送總局經濟科核辦，經呈張局長批「可」，旋張局長逕令羅巡官取消前議，對百樂行主，改處罰金，亦未送總局。庭上詢張人佑何以如此更改，渠答不知，而稱此係行政處分，局長有權更改。</p>
<p>本案昨尙傳訊水上分局副局長嚴少白，人事管理員費鼎森，巡官李友昆，德士古公司職員曹餘生等證人多名，但均未到庭，庭上旋對被告張人佑·黃伯謙·夏哲民·謝翼雲等四人，逐一審訊後，以各重要證人未齊，諭令改期再審，張人佑請求交保不准，仍予還押。其他在保之五被告，昨未傳訊。</p>

<p>食米昨市趨勢先升後回，臨收與前軋平，市塲昨日到貨共計六十五百十一石五斗，為數不少。晨開南市白粳由四百四十元喊出，米業帮逢低添補，價格俏至四百六七十元。中市以後，以市塲銀根常緊價格重見回落，臨收與前相仿。南市白粳四百五十元，北市四百八十元。薄稻南北市塲四百五十元，早稻南市四百二十五元，北市四百二十元，羊秈二市均四百四十元。</p>
<p>麵粉昨日挫落，廠方開售甚衆，同業收胃不強，客帮觀望趨勢，老車以一百五十四元做市，兵船一百四十六元，福新大包麩皮九十二元半較前跌四元至五元。</p>
<p>食油昨到銷平衡，市塲盤旋少渡動，較前略見軋升。江北吉桶生油仍為一千〇四十元，本廠豆汕八百元，軋升五十元，麻油八白五十元，亦挺起五十元，菜油六百九十元，升六十元。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕外匯移轉證昨起開始交易，上午喊價廿五圓，後提高至廿六圓，最後回至原價，廿五圓有人買進。昨日之成交數字不大，每家指定銀行僅一二萬美元而巳，估計成交總額約三四十萬美元。</p>

<p>進出口連鎖綱要及管理外匯交易辦法公佈以後，進出口業雖覺興奮，惟據某出口人士稱，今後進口所需外匯，大部均將仰賴出口，故今後出口增加以後，方能使進口增加。但目前出口仍不無困難，（一）現在時局轉變，出口物資採購地區，較以前縮小甚多，供給轉疏。（二）出口所得外匯，在指定銀行換得移轉證後，若一時不能脫售，出口商資金之週轉，必將困難。（三）國內金融局勢不穩定，利率太高，在銀根告緊之時，子金均在百分之十左右，匯款至產區採購物資，貼水甚多。週前匯款至渝，每千元祗能收到六百元，利息負擔，尙不計算在內。出口商調動資金，負擔太大。（四）國內物資缺乏，物價仍高，出口能獲利之商品仍少。如羊毛，在產區售價每擔八百金圓，運滬除去百分之十五損耗，每擔成本約一千金圓外，加水脚運費百分之廿，成本為一千二百金圓，（利息匯水不計）國外售價，羊毛每磅二角五分美金，一擔應為美金二十八元，卽以卅金圓對一美元計，共得金元八百四十元，出口尙須虧本百分之四十。至其他生絲茶葉腸衣類，亦有類似情形，當今政府若欲增加進口，勢必獎勵出口，否則在現狀下，出口依然有限。</p>

<p>市間現鈔籌碼，昨日仍感俏歛，尤以廿元，五十元及一百元大鈔，均感奇缺。聞除存款兌現之外，日來港粵單帮客商力搜，亦為一主要原因。至銀根走勢，昨日則呈明鬆暗俏之象，週轉雖感靈動，但市拆回昂，問有以卅元成交者，合月息約在六角至九角問。業內行莊，仍以短期拆借方式，供出單子不少云。</p>
<p>據中央銀行內匯科方面消息，最近一週來，本市資金流轉，由外埠移入者，浮於由本市移出者，估計當在一與二之比。因目前由滬匯至各地款項，匯水甚鉅，且若干地區，均有限額之故。</p>

<p>棉布市勢，因行情倒掛，如長沙漢口蕪湖等地之布價，俱比滬市為低，本街布號納胃不健，店舖門莊生意因貨價高貴，市民購買力大見遜色，因此添辦不暢，浮多支持乏刀，紛起吐售。十二磅龍頭細布初開喊價曾較上日好起十元，嗣因浮散競吐，遂步下挫至三百七十元有賣出，午收時再低至三百六十五元結束，較上日軋小五元，四君子元嗶嘰去化有限，最後亦小五元，為三百六十元·一九〇高檔士林布喊七百元有做開，三九〇美亭士林廠盤為七百六十元，走勢亦呆·其他各布，無甚變更云。</p>

<h3 id="c112">祁連山麓　軍牧塲 <a href="#c112" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e112" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">112</a></h3>
<p>— 本報記者　宋麟</p>
<p>〔本報蘭州十日航訊〕綿亘兩千餘里的祁連山，山之內外有廣大的牧塲，如八變之俄博與二寺灘，　源之老虎溝灘及更加爾灘，高台之東西海子，張掖之關坡康龍寺，山丹，永昌之大河壩與大馬營，永登之松山等，到處綠草如茵，卽山之深處，收草也極繁茂，誠為天然的畜牧之區。　　在山丹的大馬營，永登的松山，各設有一個軍收塲，均屬國防部西北馬政局管轄。在戡亂建國時期，各部門事業都得有適當的配合，軍牧塲，也擔當起培育軍用馬匹的工作，馬匹在軍除組織上原是重要的一環，尤其在大西北的高原上，鐵騎的建立，更富意義，更為電要。</p>
<p>山丹大馬營</p>
<p>山丹軍牧塲在　山丹縣城五十餘公里的大馬營，該地位於祁連山陰，大黃山陽，為歷朝屯兵收馬之區，面積在六千平方華里以上，附近村落稀疏，綠野無垠，塲上建有簡陋的辦公處所，馬羣管理人，則紮帳蓬居住·草原上風來如綠浪翻騰，而這散佈各處的帳幕，宛如隨風飄流的小舟。</p>
<p>該塲由一年靑的騎兵軍官石庭桂主持，率頓着官兵千餘人，在風砂瀰天的高原，堅苦推進業務。該堪現有軍馬四羣，約一萬二千餘匹，他們住在這交通不便，人烟稀少的地方，終年與馬為伍，不無寂凉之感·收塲上附設有浴室，圖書室，運動塲，秦劇園，子弟學校及合作社，以謀求官兵生活上的安定和滿足。</p>
<p>工作與改進</p>
<p>牧塲的主要工作，是軍馬的飼育，訓練和品種改進：該塲雖有茂密的收草，但未經科學整理，他們的農牧技術人員，一面從事原有野草採集，分析，試騐營養價值，以作留存，淘汰的依據。另一方面，收集世界牧草品種，試騐播種，以作推廣改良的準繩。</p>
<p>在牡駕生長三歲後，無留種必要的，便一律閹勢，開始了編隊訓練，經過相當時期馴良了，成為預備軍馬，待命踏上征程。這兒的馬以西北蒙古種為主幹，與新疆伊犂名種交配育成，確比原來的高大健壯，不久的將來，將由平津轉運來一批美國摩爾干種馬，來改進古老的蒙古品種。</p>
<p>永登軍牧塲另一個是永登軍牧塲，在永登縣屬的松山滿洲營，顧名思義，這裏是滿淸時代的軍營。明末肅王在此處被淸兵擊敗後，一蹶不振，致淸兵直搗全城，（卽今之蘭州）長趨西安，陷落潼關，明室遂亡。此地在軍事上的價值已可想見，故淸庭在此地設營，實具重大意義。</p>
<p>該場地形平坦，一片草原，遠望無際，今年雖因天旱氣燥，牧草略呈枯竭現象，但一羣羣的軍馬，當甚健壯。該塲現有馬六羣，共一千四百匹，這裏面有一羣日太投降後遺留的牝母，運送來此，和伊犂，澳洲等名種交配，巳產生了不少的新種。</p>
<p>高原生力軍</p>
<p>該塲主持人爲從事馬政事業有年的朱俊傑氏，領導着三四百人在拔海兩千六百多公尺的高原上，為國家培育機動性的鐵騎生力軍。</p>
<p>西北馬政局局長曾對記者說：這些軍收塲將來要做到，工作學校化，管理軍事化，生活家庭化，作業科學化，處事合理化。他們這一羣無名英雄，唯一的希望，便是由他們的堅苦努力中，奠定我國馬政的基礎！</p>

<p>民主好比演戲，頭牌角色固重要，配角跑龍套也重要，甚至操琴的，擊鼓的，打錢的等人亦須配合得當，演來始能緊湊精彩。演民主戲不該有台下的看客，整個戲院是舞台，看客卽是演員，演負卽是看客。演得好不好，不能責成頭牌角兒一人。但思我國代有聖賢完人，英雄豪傑，這些特出人材比今日任何國家的一般人民為優越，可是我國有了這麼少數的幾位聖賢完人英雄豪傑，有什麼用？於一般民智民德又何曾發生過什麼影響？孔孟誠聖矣，誠賢矣，實際上却如不曾有過一般。反之，觀乎文明如美國，何嘗沒有貪官污吏，劇盜奸究？然仍不妨礙其民主與文明者，只因賽如一江淸水，偶然倒入垃圾，瞬卽沉到江底去，仍不妨礙其水之為淸。足見單憑一二聖賢二三豪傑，並無多大用處，重要的是多數人能身體力行。一國之中偶有二三元兇大惡，亦無多大關礙，只須多數人不與合作，予以排斥唾棄，任憑他兇惡到如何程度，亦只像反了背的烏龜，定然無計可施。</p>
<p>復次：我們大家都說中國官塲腐敗黑暗，這點自然無可諱言。只是我們似把官民界限分得太淸，一如官和民是二種全然不同的動物似的。胡適文存引七俠五義：「……按名點進，到了御河，大家按檔兒做活。智爺拿了一把鐵鍬，撮的比人多，擲的比人遠，而且又快。傍邊做活的道：『王第二的，你這活計不是這麼做。」智爺道：「怎麼？」傍邊人道：『俗語說的：皇上家的工，慢慢兒的蹭。你要這麼做，還能吃的長嗎？』智爺道：「做的慢了，他們給飯吃嗎？」傍邊人道：「都是一樣慢了，他能不給誰吃呢？」智爺道：「旣是這樣，俺就慢慢的。」」這段調侃話自是實情。只是這船替皇上做工的人，我們算他們是官呢？抑還是民呢？實則其他的所謂官也正如俗語所說：披上袈裟是和尙，脫下袈裟還不一樣是俗人？「龍種」誠屬欺人之談，官亦並無「官種」。然則要求民主的我們，又何必自立壁壘呢？</p>
<p>故而與其空口大喝倒彩，不如急起參加演戲。若不然者，只怕今日是徒然，明日還是一個徒然，莫謂言之不預也。</p>

<h3 id="c119">談出差 <a href="#c119" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e119" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">119</a></h3>
<p>— 阿丹</p>
<p>中央和地方的機關，為了視察·調查·會議·監交·踏勘·購運·押解，和其他必須派員外勤辦公的，是之謂出差。公務員對於出差，有的視做苦差，有的看做好差，沒有一定。只有根據出差到什麼地方去，和懂得個中門檻與否而已。</p>
<p>所謂苦差，是因為受了出差費的束縛。現在出差一天，簡任職十元，薦任職八元，委任職六元，隨員四元，工役二元。這一個數目是包含一天的膳·宿·雜費在內。交通工具如火車輸船，也有規定，簡任頭等，薦委任二等，隨負工役三等，是與特別費實支實報，特別費要單據為憑。</p>
<p>簡任職每天十元的膳宿雜費，是絕對不够的，規矩點的是一天報兩天，兩天報四五天來彌補。長官與會計處（室）明知道也不查究，因為不如此無法報銷。</p>
<p>至若那些有地位的官員出差，特別費不限制開銷。這樣，不特不賠錢，反而賺錢了。有些且利用出差名義到外國或回老鄉去走一趟，或是走單帮式採購貨物來漁利，這是在於他的手法了。</p>
<p>所謂出差是好差事的，他們花樣很多，如到了某地和當地的主管在有意無意間談到當地的特產，如金華宣威的火腿，祁門武夷杭州的茶葉，台灣的草席水菓，廣東的黑膠紗綢，山東的白綢，湘川的夏布，吉林的人參，蛤士蟆，西北的地毯，張家口的磨菰，江西的瓷器，端州徽州的硯台等，他們便可以大量的送上。如說旅社喧嘩，臭蟲多，起居飲食不便，他們便會迎接到機關，或招待所裏居住，這樣便减省了一筆膳宿費的開銷。想着遊山玩水或其他娛樂消遣，都有人引導陪去，暢所欲為。</p>
<p>倘若是查勘災荒的，如果略略的透露此地災情並不嚴重，他們便設法的奉承你，要你在報告書上強調災荒奇重與地區廣闊。因為如此纔可以多得振款，且可以免去若干田賦。不然，災情輕小，那就得不着利益的。舉一反三，可例其餘。</p>
<p>法令雖有規定川差人員不能接受地方的招待，這是官樣文章，事實呢，恰巧相反，一個負有使命出差的，只是各方招待，常常弄得胃病發作與失眠。出差回來，多是滿載而歸，而他的報告書，不必自己動筆，也有人替他寫好皇皇鉅冊來了。</p>
<p>誰說出差不是好差事呢！</p>

<p>國人輒曰「可與知者言」，日「人之相知，貴相知心」。夫廓爾忘言，何必詞費？惟其不能莫逆於心，故不得不留此數行文字，而着此跡象，原意遂泯。今有才人，未能忘情，竟墮魔障，遂將此頑石堆成八陣圖，以待後來之會心人，則所待者果至，亦惟默然領會而去耳，而滔滔者遂　集此石堆之旁，指天劃地，睡沫四射，高談其所聞所見所胡思亂想者矣。</p>

<p>— 儲玉坤</p>
<p>中華民族是東亞最古的民族，不特開化最早，有五六千年輝煌的歷史，而且文物昌盛，不論文理·哲學·政經·法制，無不蔚然可觀。但近年來，因為歐風美雨的東漸，使多數人民都醉心歐美的物質文明，甚至有人對於自己的生活方式，也主張要全盤西化了。這種自卑心理，不僅在國人無以自解，在歐美人士更是莫明其妙。</p>
<p>但是在英美的有識之士，並不因中國人民的自卑而估低了中華民族五六千年的文化；而且恰巧是一個相反，物質文明發展到頂點的美國，却最能欣賞我們中國的悠久文化，例如進步黨的領袖華萊士先生，很想效法我國宋朝的大政治家王安石的「新政」；美國農業部也曾派了許多專家，潛心研究我國對於耕植的傳統經騐，以供美國改進農業的參考。中國國醫的奧妙，更引起外人無限的驚訝。</p>
<p>所以，中國文化在外人的眼中看來，簡直是一個不可測的啞謎，最近英國文化委員會羅吉斯夫人，送我一本「中華簡史」，單從它的裝訂看來，封面充滿了「古色古香」的東方氣味，就可知道它的作者辜德立先生，對於中國文化是有非常深切的研究的。辜先生現任哥倫比亞大學中國文學敎授，可以說是西方學者中最了解中國文化者之一，他用最簡潔的文字，將中國的文化·哲學·政治·經濟，作一概括的報道，使讀者一目瞭然中國的歷史。這部著作，是最適合不甚了解中國國情的外人閱讀，可使讀者容易認識中國。這是它的特色，也是它的缺陷，因為中國文化歷史，浩如蒼海，決非二百多頁的小冊子所能包括的，在我們中國的讀者看來，終不免掛一漏萬。</p>

<p>讀本報十三日第四版所載日戰犯多人受判刑宣告之攝影圖片，不覺積鬱一舒。這些惡魔　狗式的木展兒，十餘年來把中國欺侮極了。把東方大局擾亂够了。而今一個個一排排領受其應得之懲罰，令人回憶他們狂喊「膺懲」中國，獨占東亞之威風，不知何處去擺。眞是自作自受，天道好還！</p>
<p>這些都是「怖物」，「厭物」自無疑義，而印象之深淺，則因各地所經歷所感覺而有不同。此次大戰，肇端於「九一八」，而揭幕於「七七」，由東北，河北，而侵略全中國。其發難最早，搗亂最甚，聲名最劣者，厥惟前排第一之土肥原賢二，劣跡多端，綽號不一，西人名之日東方之勞倫敦，國人名之曰現實的「土行孫」，又曰「土匪」。此人在「九一八」後，走馬上任，做了一短時期的所謂「奉天市長」，後到天津，對溥儀利脅威刧，挾之而東，製造偽滿，東北大局，全歸日偽，他覺得無特別戲齣可演，又竄到關內，跑天津，跑北平，跑南京上海乃至廣東廣西，到處鼓動擾亂。其初行踪詭秘，後竟明目張膽。尤其宋哲元冀察政委會時期，他在平津及冀東偽府，竄來竄去，趾高氣揚，旁若無人，平津人士聽說「土匪」來到，人人掩鼻掩耳。冀察當局，亦無如之何。其次板垣與梅津兩個老倭，於兩次事變前後，為實地侵略之中堅，但在大衆腦海中，則不及「土匪」之普遍。板垣先則策動「九一八」，至七七事變後，又到華中一帶，大動其武。梅津是民國二十四年天津日駐津的司令，氣燄薰天，後來又做關東軍司令，監督偽滿，十足威風，戰敗之後，偕重光葵，一文一武，到盟軍艦上俯首簽降。重光葵就是「一二八」松滬戰役後被韓國志士尹先生炸掉一隻腿那個怪物，當時幾乎一命嗚呼，治愈後，依然活躍，歷任駐英駐蘇的日大使，汪偽府時，又做「駐華大使」。時與野村並稱為一個「跛子」，一個「瞎子」（野村亦是領受尹奉吉炸彈之一人，炸傷一目，而生命無恙。他是海軍將官，卻大幹外交職業，旣任外相。太平洋戰爭之前，又任駐美大使，與來栖同辦交涉，至開戰回國）。正所謂「物無獨，必有偶」。</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, Xuzhou, 23rd] (1) The National Army on the eastern front formally recovered Daxujia at dawn on the 23rd, and by noon had advanced to five miles east of the village. The Huang Army Group, which had been fighting fiercely in Nianzhuang for two weeks, in coordination with strong air power, routed the bandits it faced and began advancing westward at the earliest opportunity on the 23rd. By dusk on the 23rd, our Qiu, Li, and Huang three major army groups may converge between Bayiji and Daxujia. Daxujia is located 70 li directly east of Xuzhou, with more than 300 households. The bandits had built solid fortifications there and stationed heavy troops, attempting to prevent our pursuing troops from advancing eastward. Now, with the close cooperation of our land, air, artillery, and tank units, they were finally destroyed. The results of the battle are currently being investigated. Bayiji Station is located 30 li east of Daxujia, and Cao Baji is located 5 li south of the station. (2) On the southern route, our strong army groups approached Su County on the morning of the 23rd, echoing the army groups moving south from Xuzhou, and fiercely shelled the bandits fleeing between the three forts of Su County.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Xuzhou, 23rd] After the Qiu Qingquan and Li Mi Army Groups on the eastern front completely recovered Daxujia at 5:00 AM on the 23rd, they continued to advance rapidly east of Daxujia. At 6:00 PM, the Qiu and Li Army Groups officially met the Huang Baitao Army Group, which had held firmly in the Nianzhuang area for fourteen days and nights, at Bayiji. The remaining bandits fled south and north.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Xuzhou, 23rd] The remaining main force of the Chen bandits fled southwest from between Nianzhuang and Daxujia towards Xiao County on the 23rd.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Bengbu, 23rd] According to a senior general who told our reporter, the northern advance of our large army groups to reinforce the Xuzhou eastern front will open up the situation. This is the beginning of the second phase of the Xuzhou campaign, and the National Army can continue to reap fruitful results and stabilize the overall situation in this phase. The Huang Army Group bitterly defended Nianzhuang. On the 21st, the communist bandits fiercely attacked the Huang Army Group with a dense network of fire, firing more than 10,000 shells. The fortifications at the Nianzhuang stronghold were almost completely destroyed. The Huang Army Group then moved to a certain position northeast of Nianzhuang to continue to attract the main force of the bandits and annihilate them.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Xuzhou, 23rd] The National Army's powerful air force continued to operate on the eastern wing of Xuzhou on the 23rd, cooperating with ground troops to capture the Wangzhuang villages (both front and rear), the Huoshenmiao temples (both front and rear), Hanzhuang, Sunzhuang, Tantou and other places on both sides of Daxujia, which is more than 30 kilometers east of Xuzhou. They also bombed and killed many bandits hiding in fortifications in Sunjiazhuang, Zhangzhuang, Xizhangzhuang south of Nianzhuang, and Caojiacangfang and Huchengwei, three kilometers northwest of Cao Baji.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Xuzhou, 23rd] In the afternoon of the 23rd, the air force discovered a group of bandits gathering on both banks of the Sui River, 20 kilometers northwest of Lingbi, and also discovered more than 2,000 bandits fleeing south near the suburbs of Su County. They were subjected to fierce bombing and low-altitude strafing. It is reported that more than 2,000 bandits were killed.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Bengbu, 23rd] The forward headquarters telegraphed urgently at noon on the 23rd that our Huang Wei Army Group arrived at Nanpingji, 30 Chinese li southwest of Su County, on the 22nd. The Li Yannian Army Group arrived at Longwangmiao, south of Xisipo. The Sun Yuanliang Army Group, moving south from Xuzhou, arrived in the area south of Jiagou. On the morning of the 23rd, the three armies simultaneously moved towards Su County. The Huang and Li Army Groups launched an attack on the Liu bandit's 3rd and 9th Columns facing Su County, approaching the area. The Sun, Li, and Huang three major army groups can then converge. The Xuzhou-Bengbu section of traffic, which has been interrupted for ten days, should be cleared within days. Most of the remaining bandits are fleeing west, and we are dividing our troops to suppress them and expand the results of the battle.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Xuzhou, 23rd] The National Army Huang Wei Army Group, crossing the Hui River from northern Anhui, pressed towards Su County on the morning of the 23rd, hoping to meet the Li Yannian Army Group moving north along the Jinpu Railway in Su County and continue to advance north.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Bengbu, 23rd] Li Yannian went to the front line from Bengbu on the morning of the 23rd to command. The Liu bandits in Su County fled in groups to Lingbi and Mengcheng.</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 23rd] General Zhou Zhidong, a military commander of a certain National Army unit who was wounded near Nianzhuang during the Xuzhou campaign, flew to Nanjing from Xuzhou on the 23rd. General Zhou was shot and wounded in his left arm and right leg while personally supervising the battle on the front line. Although he had been fighting continuously and was extremely exhausted, and had just flown, his spirits were excellent. After arriving in Nanjing, General Zhou was escorted back to his residence by relatives and friends to rest, and is scheduled to fly to Shanghai by special plane on the 24th for treatment.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Xuzhou, 23rd] The bandit army repeatedly publicized that Zhou Zhidong, the military commander of a certain National Army unit who had been captured, passed through Xuzhou from Nianzhuang this morning and flew to Nanjing by special plane for medical treatment. Commander Liu dispatched Director Guo Yiyu to the airport to see him off. Zhou arrived in Xuzhou from Nianzhuang on the evening of the 20th. According to Qu Zhenyu, the battalion commander who escorted General Zhou safely to Xuzhou, our army was responsible for the western line in the main battle in Nianzhuang. Since the battle began on the night of the 10th, the bandits launched more than ten waves (the bandit's charge was wave-like, each one being a wave) of attacks every night. Therefore, the corpses of bandits piled up like mountains in front of the battle line every night. The intensity of the battle can be imagined. After the bandits were defeated and retreated, he was ordered by the commanders of the Huang and Qiu Army Groups to escort General Zhou to Xuzhou. When the front line was in fierce fighting, the bandits often used small broadcasting stations to shout in front of the battle line, and repeatedly rumored that so-and-so had been killed in battle, and so-and-so had been wounded. Our army repeatedly heard them broadcast that General Zhou Zhitong had been seriously wounded and died, but Zhou was actually personally supervising the battle on the front line at the time. They also broadcasted on the 17th that General Zhou had been captured, and this kind of inflammatory trick by the bandits is proof of the falsehood and arrogance of the bandit's propaganda.</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, Xuzhou, 23rd] On the 23rd, Zhou Zegao, He Shaonan, Li Yongliang and other 13 soldiers of the Chen bandit's Guangdong and Guangxi Column surrendered to our Sun Army Group, bringing with them 10 rifles, 1 light machine gun, more than 500 rounds of ammunition, and 30 hand grenades. They claimed that they were all forced by the bandits to participate in the battle, and that the column had been completely defeated by us. They also said that although the bandits' surveillance was very strict, there were ways to escape and surrender when the fighting was fierce. Most of those who died in battle in this column were their veteran cadres or those who had been deeply poisoned. Also, when the column participated in the Xuzhou campaign, they changed the designations of their 1st, 2nd, and 3rd Regiments to the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd Columns, in an attempt to confuse those who heard about it. Commander Sun expressed great satisfaction that the surrendered bandit soldiers were all deeply aware of righteousness and came back with weapons, and personally extended condolences and encouragement.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper, Xinyang, 23rd] A powerful army group of the National Army on the southern section of the Pinghan Railway advanced into the Tongbai Mountain area in multiple directions on the morning of the 23rd. The vanguard has now reached the southeastern suburbs of Tongbai (the border between Henan and Hubei). Another National Army unit is advancing north from Zhumadian towards Suiping and Xiping. It is reported that the bandit army's strength in that area is weak, and they already appear to be forced to retreat. The situation in Zhumadian is becoming more stable.</p>

<p>National Army in Eastern Hebei Conducts Smooth Search and Suppression</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 22nd] The army group advancing south to relieve Baoding shook hands with the National Army withdrawing from Baoding at Caohetou yesterday. All the defending troops in Baoding actively withdrew from Baoding at 2:00 AM on the 22nd. Telecommunications between Beiping and Baoding ceased at the same time. The Bandit Suppression Headquarters announced the withdrawal process, stating: "After defeating the invasion of Nie Rongzhen's 7th Column and the remnants of the 4th Column, and driving them out for a hundred li, giving them a severe blow and lesson, the National Army in Baoding decided to withdraw from the city of Baoding, and completed this decision calmly on the morning of the 22nd. This is because if a small number of troops are stationed in Baoding under the current circumstances, it will give the communist bandits an opportunity to 'bully the small'. The people in the city will also be threatened by artillery fire and starvation. If the main force of the National Army is placed in Baoding, this part of the force will be frozen. After the National Army's victorious withdrawal from Baoding, it can still re-enter in victory at any time."</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 23rd] Students from various schools in Baoding followed the army north along the Ping-Bao Road. Most of them arrived safely in Zhuoxian on the 23rd, and all of them will arrive and transfer to Beiping on the 24th. The Hebei Department of Education has found accommodation for them.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 23rd] The Bandit Suppression Headquarters announced that the National Army's light cavalry units in eastern Hebei have been making smooth progress in recent days. On the morning of the 22nd, they crossed the North Canal and launched a powerful search and suppression on the east bank of the Jiangan River, defeating the local communist battalions in Xianghe and Tongxian. The remaining bandits fled east. Currently, there are no traces of bandits within 150 Chinese li from Ping'an City in southwestern Xianghe and the line of Shimenlou (both front and rear) in southeastern Xianghe.</p>

After the above principles are passed by the Yuan, they shall be stipulated in the State-Owned Enterprise Management Law." However, most members expressed opposition to this, believing that the selling prices of state-owned enterprises were too low, so the government had to subsidize them with treasury expenditures. The essence of the subsidy policy is to increase the burden on the entire people for the benefit enjoyed by a few, which is unreasonable. Speakers rose one after another, continuing for two hours. At around 11:00 AM, the hall suddenly lost power. Candles flickered in the darkness. A certain member pointed out that the power company could not bear the burden of losses, resulting in frequent power outages. The consumption of candles actually exceeded the electricity bill dozens of times, emphasizing that low selling prices of transportation and public utilities were not beneficial to the public, and advocating that everything should be rationalized as much as possible. Finally, the entire body passed the resolution without dissent, and the case was resubmitted for review. The meeting adjourned at 12:00 PM. A supplementary meeting was held at 3:30 PM to continue discussing the cases. (4) The Health and Medical Committees reported on the review of the amended draft of the organizational regulations of the Drug and Food Inspection Bureau of the Ministry of Health, and the resolution was passed. (5) The Legislative Committee reported on the review of the draft amendment to the Examination Law, and the resolution was passed with amendments. (6) The Legislative Committee reported on the draft examination law for the promotion of civil servants, and the resolution was passed. (7) The Frontier Affairs Committee reported on the review and amendment of the Frontier Political Personnel Reward Regulations, and the resolution was passed with amendments. (8) The Transportation and Legal Committees reported on the review of the draft amendment to the organizational regulations of the Civil Aeronautics Administration of the Ministry of Transportation. The review opinion proposed to retain it, which is the same in nature as (9) Luo Heng and others' proposal to abolish the Civil Aeronautics Administration of the Ministry of Transportation in order to streamline the organization. After combined discussion, most members believed that the Civil Aeronautics Administration had specialized responsibilities and still needed to exist at present. It was resolved to hand it over to the Transportation and Legal Committees for review again under the principle of reducing its staffing. The entire agenda ended at 5:45 PM, and the adjournment was announced.</p>

<h3 id="e14">Clark Meets with American Reporters; Discusses Plans for Full Support of China; Proposes Actively Using US Military Equipment in the Pacific to Aid Our Country <a href="#e14" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c14" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">14</a></h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 22nd] Clark, an advisor to the Senate Appropriations Committee who recently visited Asia, told United Press reporters on the 22nd that he personally advocated full support for China and believed that full support for China could save the Chinese government. Clark stated in his official report issued on the 21st that the real decision on whether to fully support China must be made by the US government, not by him.</p>
<p>Clark solemnly pointed out that what he was publishing today was his personal opinion based on his observations while studying the Chinese situation on behalf of the committee. He said that his belief was based on the following three factors: (1) American military aid, strictly supervised by American officials, can effectively utilize China's "almost unlimited manpower". He recommended a training program supervised by American officers overseeing each division and overseeing the strategic participation of each division. (2) Economic aid will stabilize China's currency and consolidate the foundation of China's economy. (3) The American military equipment currently existing in the Pacific can be applied immediately. This military equipment is of utmost value to the Chinese government in this emergency time. The use of this equipment must be ordered by Washington.</p>
<p>Clark further stated that he believed that full support for China was no more warlike than airlifting supplies to Berlin, aiding Greece, or the European aid plan, and no more warlike than the Soviet Union's military and economic aid to Poland, Albania, Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, and other satellite countries. Clark continued: "In my personal opinion, substantial and effective American aid to support the Chinese government, which has always been so friendly to us, is only similar in nature to the Marshall Plan in Europe. The Marshall Plan aims to stop communism. Therefore, the problem is only in degree, not in nature."</p>
<p>Clark continued that he met with President Chiang during his visit to China and was deeply impressed by President Chiang. "I firmly believe that no matter how things develop, he will fight to the end. I believe that in principle, there is absolutely no thought of compromise in his mind, so he will fight to the end and never surrender. He is a dedicated patriot who will not give up under pressure. I believe that if it had not been for the Japanese invasion, President Chiang would have completed the unification of China."</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, London, 22nd] At a time when the US government is reviewing its China policy today, newspapers here this morning unanimously echoed the suggestion of former US Senator Clark that the United States should provide the Chinese government with appropriate military and financial assistance.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 23rd] Qian Xinzhi, Pan Gongzhan, Liu Hongsheng, Hu Dunfu, Hu Wenyao, Zhang Yi, Ling Xianyang, Zhao Dihua, Xu Kejun and other nine representatives from Shanghai's industrial, commercial, banking, and educational circles came to Nanjing from Shanghai by car at 7:00 AM on the 23rd to appeal to the United States to speed up aid to China and to request instructions on the current situation. They visited Ambassador Stuart to discuss the matter and met with President Chiang to make a request for instructions. Du Yuesheng, Xu Jiqing, Qin Runqing, Wang Xiaolai and others were unable to come due to other commitments. Accompanied by Xu Xinyu, Qian and his party visited Ambassador Stuart at 12:00 PM, handing over signed letters from university presidents, educational and academic figures in Shanghai, appealing to US President Truman and Secretary of State Marshall to strengthen aid to China, and copies of letters signed by industrial, commercial, banking, and other circles to President Truman, Secretary of State Marshall, and leaders of the US Congress, appealing to strengthen aid to China. Ambassador Stuart also hosted a luncheon. During the meal, they discussed the actual situation of US aid to China and the future development for a long time. From 4:30 PM to 6:30 PM, President Chiang held a tea party at his official residence, explaining the current situation and instructing the people in the rear to cooperate with the government and tide over the difficulties together.

<p>[United Press International, Washington, 23rd] Secretary of State Marshall's personal report to President Truman is expected to be submitted on the 23rd, to expedite important decisions on China.</p>
<p>Marshall mentioned China and other foreign policy issues during a one-hour meeting with the President on the 22nd, as well as at a luncheon meeting with the President and the Cabinet. According to President's Press Secretary Ross, Marshall may return to the White House on the 23rd for further general discussions. Reliable sources predict that future talks will specifically address the issue of potential US aid to the Chinese government, to support the Chinese government in the face of the difficult situation in the fight against the Communists.</p>
<p>Although President Chiang has appealed for US aid to China, it is generally believed that the Administration will not immediately take any active measures to deal with the progress of the Chinese Communists. Officials familiar with the situation list the following factors: (1) US foreign policy in Asia must be re-examined by senior officials, and the views of all friendly governments with strategic interests in Asia will be taken into account during the review. (2) The situation of the Communist Party's offensive from the Northeast into North China must be reassessed to determine whether China can be saved by a large amount of US economic and military assistance. (3) US interests in Europe and China must be carefully weighed to determine whether the United States can effectively extend the Truman Doctrine to China. (4) It is necessary to consult with Congressional leaders to determine their views on China and any expanded aid programs that may arise in the next Congress. One issue that must be considered in advance in the review of policy toward China is President Chiang's request for the United States to declare a policy of sympathy, unity, and support for the Chinese government, to boost morale.</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 23rd] Informed sources said today that President Truman and Secretary of State Marshall discussed ways to assist China last night. The President is eager to make a decision in order to respond in detail to President Chiang's urgent appeal for expanded US aid. The President and Marshall discussed two main points: (1) Is it too late to help the Chinese government at this moment? (2) Can the cost of an appropriate aid program for China be included in the budget without causing a deficit in the national treasury? It is reported that some government officials are considering an aid program of five billion dollars, but the duration of this program has not been decided, so the amount of aid per year cannot be speculated.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 23rd] The Chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, Bloom, announced that he will request President Truman to invite Chinese President Chiang to Washington to directly discuss the situation in China with the US government.</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 23rd] In response to rumors that President Truman plans to send Marshall to China, Ross said today that he has no knowledge of it.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, London, 22nd, United Press] A British Foreign Office spokesman said that London and Washington are exchanging views on the situation in China.</p>

<h3 id="e18">Establishing Currency Credibility and Maintaining Debt Credibility <a href="#e18" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c18" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">18</a></h3>
<p>The relationship between the government and the people, just like the relationship between people, is based on "trust". Therefore, whether in ancient or modern times, at home or abroad, a good government always prioritizes establishing credibility, so that the people can believe in it, thereby consolidating its political foundation. The story of Shang Yang moving wood to establish credibility is a perfect example. "Those who win the people prosper, those who lose the people perish" is an undeniable truth throughout history; and the key to winning or losing lies in the existence or demise of this "trust". Thousands of years ago, our political thinkers were already loudly proclaiming that "the people cannot stand without trust."</p>
<p>In the past two decades, the government's measures in various aspects have lost credibility with the people too many times. As a result, undeniably, the government's credibility has been declining day by day. However, at a time when it is fearing that it is too late to restore credibility, the "August 19th" currency reform by Wang Yunwu came along. At the beginning of its implementation, the government, as in previous times, reaffirmed its great trustworthiness to the world. The financial authorities, seeing the people, under the dual enticement of sweet words and severe punishment, rushing to send gold, silver, and foreign currencies into the Central Bank, could not but feel complacent and congratulate themselves on their success. However, how long did it take before production shrunk, the economy dried up, and people were in a state of panic across the country, creating an unprecedentedly serious situation. Since the government had made no preparations beforehand, it resorted to haphazard remedies in its desperation, sometimes supplementing, sometimes revising, with the words hardly dry before eating them, almost completely losing the people's confidence. As a result, it further affected the military aspect, with the abandonment of the Northeast and the upheaval in the Jianghuai area, almost shaking the foundation of the country. This painful experience should be a valuable lesson.</p>
<p>Now, Wang Yunwu has already left the scene, and the currency reform has gone from "only allowing success" to ending in "expected failure". The past is not worth dwelling on; however, since the War of Resistance, for more than ten years, the people have suffered from the volatility of the currency system every day, and this time, in particular, the wounds were deep and painful. To win back the people's hearts and restore credibility, the government must thoroughly reform its past policy of following the old ways and repeating itself on the currency issue, which is most closely related to the people's livelihood. The newly appointed Finance Minister Xu Kan, taking office at a difficult time, announced that the first priority of future financial measures is to rebuild currency credibility. We believe that this is a wise and essential move. According to the Central Bank's announcement, the national treasury currently has 5 million taels of gold and 100 million silver dollars, estimated to be able to redeem 12 billion gold yuan. To talk about rebuilding currency credibility at this time is not yet impossible, but it depends on the government's determination in the future.</p>
<p>First, to establish currency credibility, all future financial and economic measures must consider the interests of the people in order to win back the people's confidence. Not to mention the distant past, even in this currency reform, the government's basic motivation was only to solve the financial crisis. Therefore, its implementation methods only focused on broadly opening up financial resources for the government: on the one hand, to facilitate the massive expansion of currency, and on the other hand, to try to defraud the people's gold and silver reserves. Everything only facilitated the government, and no consideration was given to the interests of the people. After 70 days of storms, the people suffered heavy losses, while the government itself, which failed in its policies, temporarily benefited. Such measures that disregard the national economy and the people's livelihood only force the people to more firmly embark on the road of "valuing goods over currency". To demand the consolidation of currency credibility is like going south by driving the chariot north. Also, after the failure of the currency reform, the government's various supplementary and corrective measures inevitably neglected the interests of the majority of the people, but instead allowed a small number of vested interests to benefit, which also goes against the policy of establishing currency credibility.</p>
<p>Second, to establish currency credibility, all future financial and economic measures must have meticulously coordinated plans. The currency issue is linked to the development of the entire financial economy, and it is impossible to isolate it for a solution. Therefore, to establish currency credibility, at the same time, the adjustment of international trade, the encouragement of production enterprises, the regulation of material supply, the stabilization of prices and wages, the balancing of national treasury revenue and expenditure, and the most urgent control of currency issuance, all require comprehensive planning in advance. It is not permissible to be like this currency reform, treating the head when the head aches, and only seeking help from arbitrary political pressure, and instead blaming the people for not trusting the gold yuan. As Finance Minister Xu said well when meeting with reporters: "All future measures of the government must be worthy of the people, and must be carefully considered in advance, and there must be no going back on our words." We hope that this will no longer be an unredeemed check!</p>
<p>In addition to establishing currency credibility, there is also the related issue of maintaining debt credibility. As is well known, financial scholars generally believe that issuing public bonds is a better financial policy than taxation, because taxation is aimed at the general public, while borrowing is to absorb the surplus wealth of the people to make up for the deficit in the national treasury. However, borrowing cannot be done by coercive means, and its success depends on the establishment of a kind of credit similar to that in business, which requires the government to gain the trust of the people. In the past, the government's public bond policy has repeatedly lost credibility with the people, but the people have always maintained a "wait and see" attitude and have tried their best to support it. Later, due to the devaluation of the legal tender, the government issued various foreign currency bonds in order to attract people to purchase bonds. At the beginning of the issuance, the government repeatedly stated that it would do its best to maintain the interests of bondholders. However, as time passed, the government forgot about the people after several revisions and supplements, only considering its own interests. At this time, during Finance Minister Xu's reception, a reporter asked how the government would maintain debt credibility. Xu's answer was: "We will do our best to remedy the situation." We express our regret for Xu's less than sincere response. If the government is sincere in restoring and maintaining debt credibility, it should comprehensively reorganize the public bonds issued in the past. The minimum requirement for legal tender bonds is to reissue new bonds with gold yuan of the same value. US dollar bonds should continue to be valid, and US Treasury bills should also be repaid with principal and interest in accordance with the terms of issuance; and since public bonds are issued by the government, banks and money houses should be allowed to accept mortgages to facilitate turnover. If they are US dollar bonds, holders should be allowed to use them for their children's education expenses. Only in this way can the people restore confidence in public bonds. In the future, if the government has urgent needs, it should not rely on increasing currency issuance to destroy currency credibility, but can continue to issue bonds to replenish funds. Therefore, we hope that when considering how to rebuild currency credibility, do not neglect this important and interrelated link.</p>
<p>The government has repeatedly failed to keep its promises, and the people are tired of hearing them. "Governing lies not in much speaking." Finance Minister Xu stated at the press conference: "If I violate my promises in the future, please feel free to point out and criticize me." We only hope that Xu's situation of being pointed out and criticized will not happen again, because pointing out and criticizing is no longer enough to save the people's confidence, which is hanging by a thread, and the fate of the country, which is in imminent danger.</p>

The country absolutely needs individuals, as long as individuals are truly willing to work hard for the country and nation, the country will absolutely not be unfair to individuals. Finally, he asserted with a firm tone that the world will absolutely not be destroyed, and the Republic of China will have a future, as long as everyone can stand on their posts, take responsibility, and work together, the future of the country and nation will be bright. Subsequently, Liu Jianxu and He Yaozu gave speeches, and the meeting adjourned at around 5:00 PM.</p>

<p>[This Newspaper, Hangzhou, 23rd] The fourth price review meeting was held in Hangzhou on the 23rd. The liquor industry took the initiative to reduce prices, and the oil industry also requested a reduction due to continued price drops in the producing areas and lower costs.

Also, when the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway train arrived in Hangzhou on the 23rd, it transported 4,000 piculs of food rice, which was transported from Nanchang and Zhangshu, and will be freely supplied in the market within days, so rice prices are expected to fall further.</p>

<p>Regardless of the skill of propaganda, facts ultimately speak louder than words. The main theme of the Communist bandits' repeated propaganda is that the government "oppresses" the people, while the Communist bandits are the "liberators." However, the instinctive revulsion of the Chinese people towards the bandits' brutality is sufficient to severely refute the falsity of this propaganda. Today, tens of thousands of people have already, or are in the process of, fleeing from the bandit-controlled areas to the government-controlled areas. The people will surely understand who the real "liberators" are.</p>
<p>You are bound to ask me what kind of assistance the United States can offer to the Chinese government, which is in such a crisis? I want to tell you that, apart from the generous and gratefully received assistance that you have already given to China in the past, the methods and means of assistance must be decided by yourselves. The only thing I want to tell you is that any future assistance must be realized immediately. If communism prevails in China, you will ultimately not be spared, because after the Communist bandits seize China's strategic position, your own strength will also be greatly weakened. If China falls, the entire Asia will inevitably perish with it. Furthermore, the importance of Asia to world peace is certainly no less than that of Europe.</p>
<p>I know that some people in the United States believe that China is neither necessary nor important to the United States, because the United States already has a foothold in Japan. Here, I would like to point out to you a fact: if the vast Chinese mainland is seized by the enemy, the Japanese islands, exposed to the enemy, will inevitably be just a fragile outpost of the United States. This is not a one-sided argument. You may wish to consult your country's military personnel stationed in Japan.</p>
<p>If any of you still harbor the hope of forming a so-called coalition government to make peace with the Communist bandits, then I urge him to carefully consider the essay recently published by the Communist bandit leader Mao Zedong in the organ magazine of the Comintern Information Bureau. The article was broadcast by the Communist bandits' radio station on November 6. I will now quote several paragraphs from it:</p>
<p>"After the victory of the Second World War, American imperialism and its running dogs in various countries, replacing the positions of fascist Germany, Italy, and Japan, are frantically preparing for a new world war, threatening the whole world, reflecting the extreme corruption of the capitalist world and its terror of impending doom…</p>
<p>All revolutionary forces within each country… must unite with each other, form a united front against imperialism headed by the Soviet Union, and follow the correct policies."</p>
<p>When Mao Zedong's power was weak, some of his American advocates persuaded him to pretend that the CCP was just a peasant party. Now that he believes victory is in sight, he has taken off his mask and frankly admits that he is a thorough communist, not only regarding the Chinese government as an enemy, but also regarding the United States as the main enemy. If his current attempts and ambitions to subvert the government succeed, I think Americans will easily understand what his ultimate goal will be.</p>
<p>On February 18, 1943, when we were jointly resisting the threat of the Japanese aggressors, I delivered a speech in the United States Congress. In that speech, there was a passage that best illustrates a truth that inspires our spirit of resistance at this critical moment. I might as well quote it again.</p>
<p>We Chinese people, like you, need a more perfect world, not only for ourselves, but also for all mankind. We must achieve this goal, but it is not enough to merely declare this ideal, or even to think that we already possess it. In order to maintain and safeguard this ideal, we must sometimes exhaust all that we have and strive to achieve it, even at the risk of failure. We Chinese people firmly believe that it is wiser to risk a glorious struggle than to cowardly admit defeat.</p>
<p>This spirit supported us during the most critical period of the War of Resistance. Today, it is also inspiring us. Today's suppression of bandits and pacification of chaos is an extension of our past eight years of long and arduous War of Resistance, but just another chapter in a book. No matter how the changes are, no matter what kind of hardship and suffering the people and the country will endure, our struggle this time will surely be victorious, just like the victory of the War of Resistance, because the goals of the two struggles are the same.</p>
<p>Many sincere friends in the United States have always believed in us in our hardship and distress. I would like to take this opportunity to express China's eternal gratitude.</p>

<h3 id="e41">Berlin Currency Unification Issue: Four Powers Fail to Reach Agreement; Western Three Powers' Reply Still Not Sent; US Representative Reaffirms Stance, Leaving it to Security Council for Handling <a href="#e41" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c41" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">41</a></h3>
<p>[United Press, Paris, 23rd] The United States delegation to the United Nations General Assembly issued a statement today, reaffirming the United States' position of hoping that the Security Council will resolve the Berlin issue, in order to refute the news spread in Berlin that some authoritative figures in the United States believe that the Berlin issue cannot be agreed upon.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 23rd] According to British and American sources here this morning, the three powers' reply to Bramuglia has now been drafted and may be submitted this afternoon. The Soviet Union's reply has been submitted to the United Nations Secretariat. It is reported that the Soviet Union's attitude has not changed. Although American sources do not directly express pessimism about the Berlin issue, they indicate that it is impossible for the four powers to reach an agreement on the Berlin currency issue. It is also said that the main effort of the Western three powers at present is to independently seek a financial plan that will not be deceived by the Soviet Union in the future.</p>
<p>[United Press International, Paris, 22nd] The opinions of the British and French representatives still differ, and the Western allies' reply to the Berlin currency system issue therefore still needs to be delayed. Security Council President, Argentine Foreign Minister Bramuglia, is re-attempting to resolve the Berlin crisis and has raised this issue. The Soviet Union has now submitted a reply, but when the US representative Jessup, the British representative Jebb, and the French representative Barody met on the evening of the 21st to discuss the reply, they could not agree on the wording. They will meet again, hoping to complete the reply at that time, because the differences are relatively minor in nature. Although the United Kingdom, the United States, and France are cooperating with all efforts of the United Nations to resolve the Berlin dispute, their representatives are all pessimistic. It is expected that none of the four powers will change their positions to reach an agreement.</p>
<h3 id="e42">Based on Bernadotte Plan, Arab-Jewish Provisional Negotiations on Border Demarcation; Australian Representative Proposes to Political Committee <a href="#e42" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c42" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">42</a></h3>
<p>[United Press International, Paris, 23rd] Australian representative Holt suggested on the 23rd that the UN General Assembly approve Israel's membership in the United Nations as soon as possible, and allow the State of Israel and Arab countries to negotiate directly and freely agree on the final boundaries between the two sides. Holt made the above suggestion in the UN General Assembly's Political Committee. He advocated that the United Nations could only send a small mediation committee to assist direct Arab-Jewish negotiations. If the two sides cannot reach an agreement, the issue of the final boundaries of the Holy Land should be submitted to the next General Assembly for a final decision.</p>
<p>This proposal clearly indicates the important policy differences between Australia and the United Kingdom on the Palestine issue. In explaining Australia's proposal, Holt said that direct negotiations between the Arab and Jewish sides could even be held immediately in Paris and supervised by the United Nations. He emphasized that the Holy Land partition plan passed by the United Nations last November should be used as the "basic starting point" for Arab-Jewish negotiations. He said that the United Nations cannot abandon the partition plan.</p>
<p>Arab Representatives Threaten to Withdraw</p>
<p>Egyptian representative Antess Bonli immediately threatened to withdraw Egypt if the State of Israel became a member of the United Nations. The Egyptian representative said that when a person is elected as a member of a general assembly, and this member is disliked by a certain part of the members, then the only thing that a certain part of the members can do is to withdraw, and this is also the only way we can follow. As for what Antess Bonli said, it is not clear whether it was issued by Egypt alone, or by all Arab countries. The seven Arab countries often act as one, especially on the Palestine issue. In general, Egypt has led the Arab countries in the UN General Assembly, and Syria speaks for the Arab countries in the Security Council.</p>
<p>US to Propose Amendments to British Proposals</p>
<p>At the same time, US officials have completed important amendments in an attempt to ease the British Palestinian proposal presented to the Political Committee. Officials said that the amendments will be presented by US Representative Jessup on the 23rd or 24th. According to the British proposal, it is required to support the Bernadotte Plan, which divides the Negev district to the Arabs and the Western Galilee district to the Jews. Officials said that the US amendments will recommend that the United Nations Special Mediation Committee, based on the Bernadotte Plan, encourage direct Arab-Jewish negotiations to agree on their territorial agreements, and avoid adding certain clauses to both parties by the resolutions of the General Assembly. Officials also emphasized that the US amendments were agreed upon with British Palestine experts.</p>

<p>[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 23rd] Italian Prime Minister De Gasperi arrived in Paris yesterday from Beijing and held talks with French Prime Minister Gouin this morning. It is reported that the issues discussed by the two prime ministers were related to a review of the general international situation. It is speculated in political circles here that Italy may join the future Atlantic Treaty. If so, the seven-nation treaty, originally composed of the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, France, the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg, will become an eight-nation treaty with the addition of Italy. Gouin also held talks with Field Marshal Montgomery today on the technical details of the European military organization. Montgomery will stay in Paris until the 25th before returning to England.</p>

<p>[United Press International, Paris, 23rd] French Prime Minister Gouin has a great deal of confidence in obtaining a vote of confidence from the parliament this afternoon, because the Socialist Party and the Popular Republican Movement have prepared to vote in favor of the government's handling of the 51-day coal miner's strike, but they do not intend to support the passage of Gouin's new tough anti-strike bill.</p>
<p>The labor groups of the Socialist Party and the Popular Republican Movement condemned Gouin's new anti-strike bill on the evening of the 22nd. At the same time, the two labor groups will demand that the legal minimum wage be raised from 12,000 francs to 14,500 francs. The two things currently facing Gouin's cabinet are: (1) the parliamentary vote of confidence in the cabinet; (2) the Senate Speaker election on the 25th. The vote of confidence will focus on the government's handling of the recent communist-led strike. It is generally expected that de Gaulle's extreme right wing will also vote in favor of the vote of confidence. Although the Senate Speaker election is not very serious, the result has an impact. Although the de Gaulle faction does not occupy a majority in the Senate, it is the strongest force.</p>

<p>[United Press International, Seoul, 23rd] President Syngman Rhee received foreign journalists on the 23rd and reiterated his request that US troops continue to be stationed in South Korea. He requested that the United States guarantee that it would not withdraw US troops from South Korea "until we have established sufficient national defense forces." At the same time, he urged the United Nations to allow US troops to continue to be stationed in South Korea to warn the powerful communist aggressors from Soviet-controlled North Korea. He said: "If the United Nations asks the US military to withdraw, it will not only be a disaster for South Korea, but also a disaster for world democracy." He continued: "I am not asking the United States to fight the Soviet Union in the north. The United States only needs to station a small number of troops as a symbol. This move has a spiritual impact on both the Korean people and the Soviet people. We do not care about 10,000 or 5,000 people. The stationing of US troops is nothing less than a guarantee for the Korean people, and a warning to the Soviet Union." At present, the entire strength of the US troops stationed in South Korea is only one division, but the South Korean government is rapidly training more than 50,000 American-equipped national defense forces, a large number of police, and reserve forces of the same size as the army, as well as coastal security teams.</p>

He announced that because not all of the 50,000 South Korean security forces are loyal and reliable, we have decided to form a 50,000-strong national army. We need to provide them with rifles, and we also need to prepare for a considerable period of time. This is not the time for the United States or the United Nations to decide to withdraw their troops, and if they do so, there will be endless troubles.</p>

<p>[United Press International, Washington, 22nd] According to authoritative sources, senior US officials are concerned that the world will be in a state of international tension for the next decade. They therefore firmly believe that US assistance in rebuilding the Western European military alliance is very important to the national defense security of the United States itself. According to people very close to the plan, the next Congress will be asked to provide this assistance to Western European allies in the form of military lend-lease. It is said that the next defense budget will include approximately 19 billion US dollars to refurbish the equipment left over from World War II. Some of this equipment may be shipped to Western Europe under the arms plan. However, it is said that European arms aid must be allocated separately from the regular military budget. It is pointed out that the figures have not yet been discussed. Senior government officials hope that they can reduce some spending under the European Recovery Program in the next year and transfer it to European military rebuilding. These officials pointed out that the achievements of the Marshall Plan in Western Europe have exceeded expectations, but they believe that military assistance is essential to strengthen the position of European countries and overcome fears of invasion and conquest.</p>

<h3 id="e63">New Trial Measures for Rice Rationing Accounts: Notation of Rice Store Name on Certificates Expected to Eliminate Panic Buying; This Month's Ration Certificates to Be Distributed Starting Tomorrow <a href="#e63" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c63" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">63</a></h3>
<p>[Our Report] The Municipal Food Allocation Office is implementing a new rice rationing method starting this November. Designated rice stores will be responsible for the distribution, initially piloting the system in the Hongkou, Songshan, and Wusong districts. Following successful trials in these three districts, the system will be extended to all thirty districts of the city in December. The Allocation Office explained the reasons for introducing this new method: Previously, the office allocated quantities of rice to each store based on rough population estimates for each district. After the recent panic buying, some stores were overwhelmed and unable to meet demand, leading to rice shortages, while stores in other areas had few customers. The office believes that improvements are necessary to simplify procedures and avoid panic buying. Under this system, before the 25th of this month, the heads of each bao in the Hongkou, Songshan, and Wusong districts, along with representatives from the rice stores in each bao, will determine the amount of rice needed based on the population within their bao. They will then stamp and annotate the ration certificates with the store name, street name, and house number before distributing them to each household through the baojia heads. Please note: (1) This will be based on the existing household registry from September; (2) Only those with a new National Identity Card will be eligible. After receiving their certificates, residents must fill in the baojia number and household information, as before, and also include their ID card number. They should then bring their ID card (or authorize someone to purchase on their behalf) to the designated store at the beginning of next month to purchase rice. The Food Allocation Office further clarified that previous distributions were based on household registrations from two months prior. The requirement for a September registration ensures that residents have been living in Shanghai for some time, while the requirement for a new ID card indicates that they have not recently left, thus confirming the number of people in the household and preventing inflated reporting. In addition to the Hongkou, Songshan, and Wusong districts, ration certificates for all other districts will also be distributed by the baojia heads, starting on the 25th of this month and continuing until the 30th.</p>

<p>[Our Report] Regarding the application of jewelry stores to resume operations, the Social Affairs Bureau has set a standard for valuing gold jewelry. The price for selling gold jewelry will be based on the Central Bank's listed price, plus a legal profit of 20%, operating expenses of 40%, and labor costs not exceeding 50%, and submitted it to the Gold Control Bureau for approval. It is understood that the Gold Control Bureau has forwarded the proposal to the Ministry of Finance for approval. Pending approval, the jewelry stores are temporarily allowed to operate in accordance with the regulations set by the Social Affairs Bureau, and two important points must be strictly observed during this interim period of resumption of operations: (1) Each jewelry store must uniformly display a sign stating "Selling pure gold jewelry (995 fineness or higher), the price per tael (including labor costs and other expenses) is a total of [amount] gold yuan." For gold jewelry with lower fineness, the jewelry stores must reduce the selling price proportionately based on the actual fineness. Any changes to the prices displayed by the jewelry stores must first be reported to the Social Affairs Bureau and the Gold Control Bureau for approval and must not be changed arbitrarily. (2) The weight and price of each transaction must be accurately recorded in the accounting books, which will be supervised by the Social Affairs Bureau for inspection.</p>
<p>It is understood that after receiving the order, the jewelry stores resumed business and exchanged gold jewelry. It has been agreed that the price for selling gold jewelry is 2,100 yuan per tael, and the price for buying is 1,900 yuan per tael. The price for selling silver jewelry is 30 yuan per tael.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce sent a telegram to the Ministry of Finance requesting permission for people to entrust jewelry stores with the conversion of their original gold into jewelry. The telegram stated: The Presidential Order promulgated on November 13th amending the regulations for the handling of gold, silver, and foreign currency held by the people still falls within the scope of "permitting people to hold" these assets. Moreover, the national policy on gold has been revised repeatedly. In February of the 36th year of the Republic, after the Central Bank stopped selling gold, people were still allowed to convert their original gold into gold jewelry. Now that the Central Bank is selling gold, the policy is more relaxed than in February of the 36th year of the Republic. Therefore, people should certainly be allowed to convert their gold or silver into gold or silver jewelry, which is not prohibited. Based on the above reasons, it is requested that your ministry appropriately amend Articles 3, 4, 5, and 6 of the Regulations for the Management of the Purchase, Sale, and Manufacture of Gold and Silver Jewelry, passed at the Executive Yuan's regular meeting on October 27th, so that the jewelry industry has a more abundant source of materials and is not left with no business to operate. Gold and silver that has not been exchanged in rural areas can also be converted into gold and silver jewelry for utilization, which is better than hoarding and is also a way to store wealth among the people.</p>

<h3 id="e86">Price of Coal Increases by 140% in Second Half of Month <a href="#e86" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c86" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">86</a></h3>
<p>Arrival of Coal from Various Locations Reaches 20,000 Tons</p>
<p>[Our Report] The price of coal per jin for the second half of this month has been decided, and will increase by 140% compared to the first half of the month. The delivery price in Shanghai is 592 yuan, and the delivery price in Nanjing is 445 yuan. The new prices will be implemented starting from the 19th.</p>
<p>Furthermore, it is learned that the arrival of coal in our city in the second half of this month has improved significantly compared to the first half of the month. To date, the continued arrival of coal from various locations has reached 20,000 tons. More than 10,000 tons of Taiwanese coal have been gradually loaded, and more than 2,000 tons of Kailuan coal have also been loaded. An additional 700 tons are expected to arrive in the next few days. The number of ships requisitioned for military transport in the second half of the month has decreased, so the number of coal transport vehicles has also increased. Currently, there are seven or eight ships waiting to load coal at Tanggu New Port. Therefore, Kailuan coal will continue to arrive in succession. The railway line to the Huainan mines has also recently been opened, so the accumulated coal in Huainan can be transported to Jingbu in a continuous stream. If the transportation volume is normal, 2,000 tons can arrive each day. Jingdi has a surplus of supply and can also transfer some to Shanghai to increase the supply.</p>
<h3 id="e87">Labor Strike in Leather Shoe Industry Resolved Yesterday; Agreement Reached on Two Points, Workers Return to Work; Labor Dispute in Western Clothing Industry Being Mediated; Strike at China Textile Machinery Company <a href="#e87" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c87" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">87</a></h3>
<p>[Our Report] The labor strike in the leather shoe industry in our city was resolved yesterday after mediation by the Social Affairs Bureau. The Class A shoemaking workers who had been on strike have agreed to return to work today. The two points agreed upon by labor and management are: (1) Salaries for October will be paid at double the rate. (2) Half of the salaries for the second half of this month will be temporarily borrowed according to the cost of living index of the previous period. The Social Affairs Bureau will submit the requests to abolish tiered discounts and calculate salaries according to the current cost of living index for discussion at the regular meeting of the Labor-Management Appraisal Committee to be held on the 30th of this month.</p>
<p>Workers in the western clothing industry have also recently experienced similar slowdowns. Wages in this industry have always been calculated on a piece-rate basis. Before the cost of living index was restored, each set of clothing was paid a labor cost of 13 yuan, plus a living allowance of 5 yuan 5 jiao. After the government restored the cost of living index method of calculating wages, management intended to cancel the living allowance, while labor requested that the 5 yuan 5 jiao be added to the base salary and calculated along with the index. After submitting the case to the Social Affairs Bureau for mediation, the workers have voluntarily reduced the 5 yuan 5 jiao to 4 yuan 5 jiao to show their sincerity. Management plans to convene a meeting of the directors and supervisors of the industry association to discuss countermeasures.</p>
<p>Workers at the China Textile Machinery Company borrowed salaries for two months and twenty days (according to the August 19th salary (ten)) before price controls were lifted. After the government restored the cost of living index method of calculating wages, management intended to deduct the previous arrears, first issuing half of the amount. The workers protested and made three demands: (1) The monthly salary of the worker arrested on November 2nd for a certain reason should be paid as usual, and his position should be retained. (2) The previously borrowed monthly salary should not be deducted. (3) Another half-month salary should be borrowed. The factory refused, and the workers went on strike. This dispute is also being mediated by the Social Affairs Bureau.</p>

<p>[Our Report] Teachers and staff of municipal elementary schools returned to work yesterday after their leave. All directors, supervisors, and representatives accompanied Director Li of the Education Bureau to visit Mayor Wu yesterday morning to request prompt handling of the allocation of supplies to stabilize the lives of teachers and staff. Mayor Wu stated that the woolen yarn has already begun to be distributed, and the cigarettes have also been cleared. Other supplies will be handled as soon as possible. The rice for December will be issued immediately, and arrangements have been made with Zhongfang Company to distribute woolen fabric and serge, with three yards allocated per person. In addition, Mayor Wu promised that teachers and staff could participate in the welfare organization of the Education Bureau employees. Regarding the adjustment of the salaries of public education personnel to be paid at five times the original amount, Mayor Wu stated that after the Executive Yuan approves the order, he will borrow funds from the Central Bank to make up the two and a half times the original amount. [Our Report] The Municipal Education Bureau is handling the purchase of woolen yarn for teachers and staff of municipal schools and affiliated agencies. It has arranged with the factory to pay in batches and pick up the goods. Each school should pay the fees to the Personnel Office of the Education Bureau from the 23rd to the 26th of this month, according to the number of people with original purchase certificates in October, at a price of 9 yuan 6 jiao per pound (including laborers). A receipt will be issued first, and each unit can take the receipt and a copy of the general roster (see the announcement board of the Education Bureau for the roster format) to the Personnel Office of the Education Bureau to collect the goods according to the collection date indicated on the receipt. It is also learned that temporary rice ration certificates will be issued this Saturday for the early collection of rice for December by municipal schools. The specific measures will be announced soon.</p>
<h3 id="e89">Private Elementary School Teachers Request Collective Leave; Mayor Wu Disapproves <a href="#e89" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c89" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">89</a></h3>
<p>[Our Report] The Private Elementary School Teachers Association decided to take a collective leave of absence for one week, starting today. Director Li of the Education Bureau has reported this matter to Mayor Wu, who is said to have instructed the principals to be responsible for not allowing the leave. He also stated that the decision to take a collective leave of absence was only made by a small portion of the private elementary school teachers.</p>
<p>According to the Private Elementary School Teachers Association, they had previously requested emergency relief from the authorities due to the difficult living conditions of their members. Their requests were the same as those of the municipal school teachers and staff, namely, one shi of white rice, two bags of flour, and 500 gold yuan per person. Mayor Wu stated at the time that the teachers and staff could receive subsidies from fees collected from parents. However, Director Li's remarks to the press affected the collection of fees by various schools, and the hope of receiving living subsidies for teachers and staff was dashed. Therefore, the Board of Directors decided to take a collective leave of absence.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the Shanghai Relief Committee Fundraising Committee held its first fundraising meeting at the Lido Flower Garden. Mayor Wu first reported on two points: (1) The second meeting of the Shanghai Relief Committee resolved that the winter relief work for the 37th year of the Republic in our city will be handled by the Shanghai Relief Committee, and the fundraising will be handled by this committee. A separate winter relief committee will not be established. (2) The symposium convened by the municipal government on October 27th regarding the relief of refugees discussed the fundraising aspect and decided (A) to follow the precedent of the Hankou flood and collect a relief surcharge on customs duties, which requires seeking approval from the central government; (B) to borrow 3 million gold yuan from the Central Bank as an advance payment. An agreement has been reached for the Bank of Communications to borrow 500,000 gold yuan first. Next, Mr. Du Yuesheng presided over the discussion of fundraising targets and methods. The results were as follows: (1) The fundraising target for winter relief this year is set at 20 million to 30 million gold yuan. (2) Mayor Wu, Du Yuesheng, Director Wu, and others will jointly send letters to all levels of automobile owners in our city, requesting voluntary donations. (3) The fundraising committee will regularly invite theatrical performances, famous actors, famous performers, and performing arts groups to hold radio appeals. (4) The fundraising committee will regularly organize various charity ball games with the Sports Association.

<h3 id="e91">Nanshi Stadium Friendly Football Match: "Northeast Wind" Politely Wins Over Shanghai Police by One Goal <a href="#e91" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c91" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">91</a></h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] Yesterday, the Shanghai Municipal Police Bureau Sports Association held a friendly football match at the Nanshi Stadium, with the Shanghai Police inviting the "Northeast Wind" team to compete. Although the Shanghai Police's strength was quite weak, the Northeast Wind played extremely politely, winning only by a score of 2-1. In the first half, Northeast Wind led 2-0. Northeast Wind controlled the entire game from start to finish, missing many opportunities, otherwise the score would have been more lopsided. Yesterday afternoon, there were over three thousand spectators, and the atmosphere was quite lively.</p>
<p>Yesterday, Northeast Wind benefited greatly from the presence of Tan Fuzhen at the rear guard, making the defense much more solid. The forwards were able to use both wings to attack, tiring out the Shanghai Police. The Shanghai Police's defense was too poor, and their goal area became a scene of utter panic. The Shanghai Police presented flowers before the start of the match, and the referee was Fang Rongfu. The Shanghai Police attacked first, with great momentum, but failed to score. Northeast Wind counterattacked, causing alarms throughout the Shanghai Police's goal area. Northeast Wind continued to attack fiercely, and finally, at 35 minutes, Xia Shufu, on the right wing, crossed the ball, Jiang Kun missed it, and Wang Burong caught up and shot it in. In less than three minutes, Jiang Kun scored the second goal, giving Northeast Wind a clean 2-0 lead in the first half.</p>
<p>In the second half, the Shanghai Police counterattacked, but missed opportunities near the goal. At five minutes, Ma Qingyuan handled the ball, resulting in a penalty kick. Northeast Wind did not press their advantage and did not use full force, resulting in a missed penalty. The Shanghai Police's fortunes turned around, and one minute later, Yuan Kuntian dribbled past Li Chengxian and scored, pulling back one goal. The final score was 2-1.</p>

<p>[Our Dispatch] Yesterday, the Donghua Football Team played a friendly match against the new army Zhenxing Team at the Jiaotong University stadium, with nearly a thousand fans watching. Zhenxing had less experience, and within five minutes, Donghua's right wing Guan Yongchang scored a goal. It wasn't until 30 minutes that Xi Yulong broke the net, making the score 1-1 at halftime. In the second half, Zhenxing switched to an offensive, but Donghua did not relax. At 12 minutes, Qian Yunqing kicked in a goal, and within two minutes, Han Longhai scored another, resulting in a 3-1 victory for Donghua. Donghua was originally scheduled to play against Zhonghang today, but due to the need for rest, it has been postponed.</p>

<h3 id="e96">Zhang Renyou and Others' Corruption Case: The District Court Reopens the Trial Yesterday. All Witnesses Testified in Detail Regarding the Extortion, Occupation, and Concealment Portions. <a href="#e96" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c96" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">96</a></h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] The case of former Water Police Branch Chief Zhang Renyou and nine others, accused of corruption and dereliction of duty, was reopened yesterday afternoon by Judge Guo Zugan of the District Court. Regarding the portion where Zhang Renyou was accused of extorting property, Wu Delin, manager of the New Fuxin Shipping Company, stated that the company's ship had an accident on March 16th due to a damaged winch, causing timber to fall and kill a worker named Yang Qing. Afterwards, the Water Police Branch detained the ship's engineer Wang Wengao, and he sent the company's general affairs director Guo Liangzhen to the station to inquire. As a result, after bailing out Wang and Guo, they directly paid the family of Yang Ji, the deceased worker, a compensation of 180 million legal tender and 5 million for lawyer's fees. The family of the worker then voluntarily withdrew the lawsuit from the Water Police Branch, reaching a settlement. Besides this, no payments were made to other parties.</p>
<p>False Reporting of 700 Gallons of Diesel Fuel</p>
<p>Witness Chen Shaoxi (former general affairs staff of the Water Police Branch) testified in court regarding the portion where defendants Zhang Renyou, Huang Boqian, and others were accused of embezzling public property: He was in charge of receiving, distributing, and reporting fuel, ammunition, clothing, etc. for the branch. The branch had an eight-horsepower speedboat, which was damaged and taken out of service on March 8th this year after being hit by a customs vessel. After learning of this upon taking office, Chief Zhang sent a letter of negotiation. However, under the orders of Section Chief Huang, the diesel fuel used by the boat was still falsely reported as before. Although he knew it was a false report at the time, he had no choice but to comply with the Section Chief's orders. After work each day, the key to the oil depot would be opened and handed over to others for safekeeping. He did not know whether it was being stolen and sold. Later, after someone secretly reported it, Chief Zhang ordered Section Chief Huang to find a way to correct it with the General Bureau. Section Chief Huang said that there were many leaks in the diesel barrels, and the inflated figures were intended to make up for the losses. Within just two months, the false reports amounted to 710 gallons. In addition, the seized coal stored at the station in April and May of this year suddenly disappeared. Later, after investigation, it was discovered that Section Chief Huang had sold it and received 3 million, which he refused to accept.</p>
<p>Changing Fines Without Sending to the General Bureau</p>
<p>Regarding Tan Wenxi and others' US dollar transactions, and the portion where Zhang Renyou was accused of dereliction of duty and concealment, witness Shen Huanling (former first section chief of the Water Police Branch) testified that the Balle Automobile Company had illegally built a wooden kiosk at Wharf No. 10 on the Bund to conduct business for American soldiers on leave. After Officer Luo of the branch investigated, he felt that the proposed punishment was too lenient, so he separately signed an opinion proposing detention for two days as a warning. Regarding the US dollar transaction portion, he intended to send it to the Economic Section of the General Bureau for review. After submitting it to Chief Zhang, he approved it with "Okay." Subsequently, Chief Zhang directly ordered Officer Luo to cancel the previous proposal, changed the punishment for the Balle Company owner to a fine, and did not send it to the General Bureau either. In court, he asked Zhang Renyou why he made these changes. He replied that he did not know, and claimed that this was an administrative punishment and that the chief had the right to make changes.</p>
<p>Many witnesses, including Deputy Chief Yan Shaobai of the Water Police Branch, personnel administrator Fei Dingsen, Officer Li Youkun, and Texaco employee Cao Yusheng, were also summoned yesterday, but none of them appeared in court. The court then questioned the defendants Zhang Renyou, Huang Boqian, Xia Zhemin, and Xie Yiyun one by one. Since the important witnesses were not all present, the court ordered a postponement for retrial. Zhang Renyou's request for bail was denied, and he was returned to custody. The other five defendants who were out on bail were not summoned yesterday.</p>

<p>[Our Dispatch] Yesterday afternoon, representatives from the private elementary school principals' associations of various districts in the city, including Yan Guodong, Feng Yagu, Yu Xian, Wang Shiying, Ji Yangbing, Qian Jimin, and Tao Yayu, visited Education Bureau Director Li to request relief for the private school teachers and staff who were unable to maintain their livelihoods due to their difficult living conditions.

(2) Request permission for each school to collect a living subsidy fee from teachers and staff. (3) Request permission to transfer the November and December allocation of four dou of specially allocated rice to teachers and staff in advance to the People's Food Allocation Committee. (4) Request permission to allocate confiscated materials. Director Li and Section Chief Zhu replied as follows: (1) It has been decided that private school teachers will be allocated one pound of Rongshen yarn, and the Taibureau will negotiate with the Social Bureau to issue vouchers for allocation. (2) The bureau had already approved each school to discuss collecting a teacher's living subsidy or welfare fund with students' parents. It is hoped that mandatory regulations will not be set. (3) Regarding the allocation of rice, the bureau will negotiate with the People's Food Allocation Committee to allocate it in advance. (4) The quantity of confiscated materials is not as large as rumored outside. How to distribute them will be decided after verification.

<p>[Our Dispatch] The Ministries of Interior, Industry and Commerce, and National Defense have jointly drafted measures for urban water and electricity conservation in order to strictly enforce water and electricity conservation in cities. The measures have been approved by the Executive Yuan and will be implemented. In addition to instructing the Public Utilities Bureau to comply, the municipal government has also issued orders to its departments to be informed. The main points of the measures are as follows: (1) All water and electricity plants should provide universal supply to users who apply for installation for legitimate purposes in accordance with regulations. Any extortionate behavior will be dealt with as corruption. (2) From the date of promulgation of these measures, electrical users are prohibited from installing neon lights. Those who have already installed them are not allowed to use them after 10:00 PM. Those who violate this will have their electricity supply suspended. (3) Local military, government, police, and gendarmerie agencies should pay fees in accordance with the preferential measures set by the water and electricity plants. If there is theft of water or electricity in the office buildings and employee, soldier, and police dormitories of these agencies, or in the private residences of their subordinates, the water and electricity plants will handle the matter according to the procedures they have set after verification. If necessary, the name of the agency or the user's name will be publicly announced to impose strict sanctions on their reputation and public opinion. (4) From the date of implementation of these measures, water and electricity companies in each city should complete rectification within three months. They may not stop the supply of all or part of the water and electricity unless there are special reasons that have been verified and approved by the competent authorities.</p>

<p>[Our Dispatch] Liu Zhixiong was sentenced to life imprisonment yesterday by the District Court for stabbing his aunt to death with a military knife and attempting suicide. Liu Zhixiong and Liu Yintang were cousins through their shared grandfather. Yintang was promoted by Zhixiong's father, Liu Ruxiang (the bogus China Reserve Bank's Business Bureau Director), and his family's financial situation gradually improved. After Ruxiang was imprisoned, Zhixiong's family's financial situation declined, and he suffered from lung disease. Last December, he needed money for medical treatment and borrowed money from Yintang. Yintang agreed to bear the medical expenses, but did not agree to lend the money. After Zhixiong had surgery in the hospital, Yintang suddenly regretted his promise and did not lend the money. At the end of April this year, Zhixiong was financially distressed and returned home from the hospital to recuperate. At 8:45 AM on September 8, carrying a hand grenade, he went to Yintang's residence on Bixun Road and encountered Liu. His attitude was fierce. Yintang's wife, Xiao Wenru, saw that the situation was not good and immediately hugged Zhixiong, allowing Yintang to escape. Zhixiong then pushed Xiao down and threw the hand grenade at Yintang, which exploded on the spot. Yintang escaped quickly and was not injured. Zhixiong entered the room and stabbed Yintang's mother to death with a military knife. He then used the knife to cut his own throat and fell to the ground. The police were notified and sent officers to the scene. Zhixiong had not died and was sent to the hospital for treatment. The case was then transferred to the District Prosecutor's Office for investigation and prosecution.</p>

<p>[Our Dispatch] The Ministry of Finance previously received a joint telegram from the Shanghai Banking, Money Lending, and Trust Associations, stating that the Shanghai market's funds were extraordinarily tight and explaining the difficulties in increasing capital. They requested that the deadline for increasing capital be extended. To sympathize with the merchants' difficulties, the Ministry of Finance has recently approved that the deadline for increasing capital of financial firms in various regions should be calculated in accordance with the provisions of the Legal Enforcement Date Limit Regulations. Those that were originally scheduled to end before the end of December of this year are all approved for an extension to the end of December of this year. All financial firms must complete the procedures within the deadline and must not delay any further.

<p>It is also learned that, among the banks in Shanghai, only two or three have completed the capital increase procedures so far.</p>
<h3 id="e103">The Rice Market is Stable <a href="#e103" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c103" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">103</a></h3>
<p>The trend of the rice market yesterday was to rise first and then fall back, ending even with the previous day's prices. The total amount of goods arriving on the market yesterday was 6,511 dan and 5 dou, which was quite a large amount. The opening price of Nanshi white japonica rice was shouted out at 440 yuan. Rice merchants made purchases at low prices, and the price rose sharply to 460-470 yuan. After midday, prices fell back due to the tight money market, and the closing price was similar to the previous day. Nanshi white japonica rice was 450 yuan, and Beishi was 480 yuan. The price of Nanshi and Beishi thin rice was 450 yuan, the price of Nanshi early rice was 425 yuan, and the price of Beishi was 420 yuan. The price of sheep rice in both cities was 440 yuan.</p>
<p>The price of flour fell yesterday. The factories were selling a lot, but the merchants were not strong in their purchases. The customers were watching the trend. The price of old vehicles was 154 yuan, the price of military ships was 146 yuan, and the price of Fuxin's large-package wheat bran was 92.5 yuan, down 4-5 yuan from the previous day.</p>
<p>The supply and sales of edible oil were balanced yesterday. The market fluctuated slightly and rose slightly compared to the previous day. Jiangbei Jituo raw oil was still 1,040 yuan, this factory's soybean oil was 800 yuan, up 50 yuan, sesame oil was 850 yuan, also up 50 yuan, and vegetable oil was 690 yuan, up 60 yuan.</p>
<p>The price of miscellaneous grains rose and fell yesterday. Hankou broad beans were 180 yuan, Pinghu small coarse beans were 220 yuan, Yangzhou raw peanuts were 480 yuan, Qidong corn was 155 yuan, and Datong bean cakes were 70 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e104">The Foreign Exchange Market Resumes Trading <a href="#e104" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c104" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">104</a></h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] Foreign exchange transfer certificates began trading yesterday. The asking price in the morning was 25 yuan, then it increased to 26 yuan, and finally returned to the original price of 25 yuan, where someone bought it. The volume of transactions yesterday was not large. Each designated bank only traded 10,000 to 20,000 US dollars. It is estimated that the total transaction volume was about 300,000 to 400,000 US dollars.</p>
<h3 id="e105">Export Incentives are Still Needed After the Announcement of New Foreign Exchange Measures <a href="#e105" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c105" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">105</a></h3>
<p>Although import and export industries feel excited after the announcement of the "Import and Export Linkage Outline" and "Regulations for Managing Foreign Exchange Transactions", according to an exporter, most of the foreign exchange needed for imports in the future will rely on exports. Therefore, imports can only increase when exports increase. However, there are still difficulties in exporting at present. (1) The procurement areas for export materials are now much smaller than before due to the changing situation, and the supply has become sparse. (2) After the foreign exchange earned from exports is exchanged for transfer certificates at designated banks, exporters' capital turnover will be difficult if they cannot sell them immediately. (3) The domestic financial situation is unstable, and interest rates are too high. When funds are tight, lending rates are around 10%. There are also many surcharges for remitting funds to production areas to purchase materials. A remittance to Chongqing a week ago only received 600 yuan per 1,000 yuan, not including the interest expense. Exporters have too much of a burden when transferring funds. (4) There is a shortage of domestic materials, and prices are still high. There are still few commodities that can be exported profitably. For example, the selling price of wool in the production area is 800 gold yuan per dan. After deducting 15% loss during transport to Shanghai, the cost per dan is about 1,000 gold yuan, plus 20% for water transportation and freight, the cost is 1,200 gold yuan (excluding interest and remittance charges). The selling price of wool abroad is 25 cents USD per pound, so one dan should be 28 USD. Even at 30 gold yuan per USD, it is only 840 gold yuan, so exporting would still result in a loss of 40%. The same situation applies to other items such as raw silk, tea leaves, and sausage casings. If the government wants to increase imports now, it must incentivize exports; otherwise, exports will remain limited under the current circumstances.</p>
<h3 id="e106">The Money Market is Apparently Relaxed but Actually Tight <a href="#e106" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c106" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">106</a></h3>
<p>Cash on the market still felt tight yesterday, especially large bills of 20, 50 and 100 yuan, which were very scarce. It is said that, in addition to withdrawals of deposits, the vigorous search by Hong Kong and Guangdong merchants who have recently arrived is also a major reason. As for the trend of the money market, it appeared to be relaxed but was actually tight yesterday. Although turnover felt flexible, call loans were high. There were transactions at 30 yuan, equivalent to a monthly interest rate of about 6-9%. Many industry financial firms were still offering bills in the form of short-term borrowing.</p>
<p>According to news from the Central Bank's domestic exchange department, in the past week, the inflow of funds into Shanghai from other regions has exceeded the outflow from Shanghai by an estimated ratio of 1 to 2. This is because the remittance charges from Shanghai to various regions are very high and some regions have limits.</p>
<h3 id="e107">Yarn and Cloth Prices Decline Slightly <a href="#e107" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c107" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">107</a></h3>
<p>The yarn market saw sluggish sales from both local and external buyers yesterday. The conversion price for gold by the Central Bank was lower than the general price, so speculative funds shifted their target. Because there had been a strong rise the previous day, speculators were selling heavily and traders actively purchased, resulting in supply exceeding demand. Although 42-count Blue Phoenix fine yarn once rose to 11,500 yuan, as closing approached, many sellers rushed to sell, and the asking price fell back slightly to close at 11,000 yuan, down 100 yuan from the previous day. The forward price was 11,300 yuan. 21-count Double Horse yarn also rose by 100 yuan at one point, but finally closed at 7,900 yuan, down slightly by 100 yuan. Other counts of coarse and fine yarns also fell by 100-200 yuan, with quite light trading.</p>
<p>In the cotton cloth market, prices were inverted. The prices of cloth in places such as Changsha, Hankou, and Wuhu were all lower than in Shanghai. Cloth shops on this street were not actively purchasing. Shop business was slow because prices were high and citizens' purchasing power had greatly declined. Therefore, there was no smooth purchasing, and many speculators lacked support and rushed to sell. The opening asking price for 12-pound Dragon Head fine cloth was 10 yuan higher than the previous day, but as speculators competed to sell, it gradually declined to 370 yuan for sale, and then fell to close at 365 yuan, down slightly by 5 yuan from the previous day. Sales of Four Gentlemen Yuan serge were limited, and it also fell slightly by 5 yuan to 360 yuan. 190 high-end Shilin cloth was offered at 700 yuan. 390 American Pavilion Shilin cloth was priced at 760 yuan, and its trend was also sluggish. There were no significant changes for other cloths.</p>
<h3 id="e108">Broadcloth Sales Become More Active <a href="#e108" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c108" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">108</a></h3>
<p>Broadcloth sales are gradually becoming more active. Retail business in shops on Qipan Street has improved daily compared to last week. Yesterday, the wholesale price of Yinfeng Zhanghua tweed on the market was 250-260 yuan per yard, Shanghai Double Cat brand tweed was 275 yuan, Xiexin Yuanfeng was 290 yuan, Zhongfang 1830 and 1831 Tibetan thick serge were both sold at 175 yuan, Double Deer flowered western cloth was sold at 14 yuan, and Kai 277 French shirt was 6.5 yuan. External sales have not yet developed.</p>
<h3 id="e109">Silk is All Selling Well <a href="#e109" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c109" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">109</a></h3>
<p>Rayon is strong. Although the firms' cash positions are slightly tight, people are optimistic because the CITIC Bureau has not allocated any for a long time, and asking prices continue to rise. The initial opening price for 120 Tianqiao was 11,000 yuan outside of customs, directly approaching 12,000 yuan. Afterwards, prices from outside reported declines, and the closing price was 11,600 yuan, up 1,100 yuan. D-grade factory silk was offered at 14,500 yuan, up 1,000 yuan. Dacheng quilt covers were also boosted to 7,600 yuan, up 300 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e110">Little Trading for Export Tea <a href="#e110" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c110" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">110</a></h3>
<p>Although foreign tea firms, which had been quiet for a long time, were inquiring, the difference between their ideal prices and the sellers' was too large, and trading fell into stagnation again. Judging by the situation, there is little prospect of a breakthrough in the short term. As for tea for domestic sales, since the lifting of price controls, prices have increased several times, but sales in this street and other places have not weakened at all. The process has been active, and the price is changing all the time as the owners move their asking prices, showing improvement every day.</p>
<h3 id="e111">Sugar Sales are Sluggish and Allocations are Reduced <a href="#e111" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c111" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">111</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Office of Taiwan Sugar Corporation announced its 30th quotation and allocation of Taiwan sugar yesterday (the 23rd). The number of sugar merchants applying was not crowded. This was due to the recent sluggish domestic sales and the limited actual sales in the city. Therefore, the sugar market has been weak for days. It is reported that the total amount of Taiwan sugar allocated today was less than 5,000 bags, a decrease of about three-quarters compared to the previous period.</p>

<h3 id="e112">Foothills of the Qilian Mountains: Military Pasture <a href="#e112" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c112" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">112</a></h3>
<p>— Our Reporter, Song Lin</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Lanzhou Dispatch, 10th] The Qilian Mountains, stretching over two thousand li, have vast pastures both inside and outside the mountains. Such as the Babian Zhi Ebo and Ersi Tan, the Laohugou Tan and Gengaer Tan of the headwaters, the Dongxi Haizi of Gaotai, the Guanpo Kanglong Temple of Zhangye, the Daheba and Damaying of Shandan and Yongchang, and the Songshan of Yongdeng. Everywhere, the green grass is like a carpet. Even in the depths of the mountains, the harvested grass is extremely lush, truly a natural area for animal husbandry. In Damaying of Shandan and Songshan of Yongdeng, there are military ranches, all under the jurisdiction of the Northwest Horse Administration Bureau of the Ministry of National Defense. In this period of suppressing rebellion and building the nation, all departmental endeavors must be properly coordinated. The military ranches also undertake the task of cultivating military horses. Horses are an important part of the military organization, especially on the plateaus of the Great Northwest. The establishment of iron cavalry is even more significant and essential.</p>
<p>Damaying in Shandan</p>
<p>The Shandan Military Ranch is located in Damaying, more than fifty kilometers from Shandan County. This location is located on the Yin side of the Qilian Mountains and the Yang side of the Dahuang Mountains, an area for stationing troops and raising horses throughout the dynasties. The area is over six thousand square li. Nearby villages are sparse, and the green fields are boundless. The ranch has simple office facilities. The horse herd managers live in tents. On the grassland, the wind comes like green waves surging, and the tents scattered everywhere are like small boats drifting with the wind.</p>
<p>The ranch is managed by Shi Tinggui, a young cavalry officer, who leads more than a thousand officers and soldiers, pushing forward the business diligently on the windy and sandy plateau. The ranch currently has four herds of military horses, about twelve thousand horses. They live in this place with inconvenient transportation and sparse population, living with horses all year round, and there is no sense of loneliness. The ranch has attached bathhouses, libraries, sports grounds, Qin opera gardens, children's schools, and cooperatives to seek stability and satisfaction in the lives of officers and soldiers.</p>
<p>Work and Improvement</p>
<p>The main work of the pasture is the breeding, training, and breed improvement of military horses. Although the ranch has dense grass, it has not been scientifically managed. Their agricultural and animal husbandry technicians are engaged in the collection and analysis of the original wild grass to test its nutritional value, as a basis for retention and elimination. On the other hand, they collect world pasture varieties and test planting as a guideline for promotion and improvement.</p>
<p>After the mares grow for three years, those who do not need to be reserved for breeding are all castrated, and the team training begins. After a considerable period of taming, they become reserve military horses, waiting to embark on the expedition. The horses here are mainly of the Northwest Mongolian breed, crossbred with the famous Ili breed of Xinjiang, which is indeed taller and stronger than the original. In the near future, a batch of American Morgan stallions will be transferred from Tianjin to improve the ancient Mongolian breed.</p>
<p>Yongdeng Military Ranch</p>
<p>Another military ranch is the Yongdeng Military Ranch, located in Manzhouying of Songshan, Yongdeng County. As the name suggests, this was a military camp during the Manchu Qing Dynasty. At the end of the Ming Dynasty, Prince Su was defeated by the Qing army here and never recovered, causing the Qing army to directly attack the entire city (now Lanzhou), advance to Xi'an, and capture Tongguan, and the Ming Dynasty perished. The military value of this place is already imaginable, so the establishment of a camp here by the Qing court was of great significance.</p>
<p>The terrain of the ranch is flat, a vast grassland, seemingly boundless in the distance. Although the pasture grass shows a slight depletion phenomenon this year due to drought and dryness, the herds of military horses are very strong. The ranch currently has six herds of horses, a total of one thousand four hundred horses. Among them, there is a herd of mares left over after Japan surrendered, transported here, and crossbred with famous breeds from Ili, Australia, etc., and many new breeds have been produced.</p>
<p>New Force on the Plateau</p>
<p>The ranch manager is Zhu Junjie, who has been engaged in horse administration for many years, leading three to four hundred people on the plateau at an altitude of more than 2,600 meters, cultivating a mobile iron cavalry force for the country.</p>
<p>The Director of the Northwest Horse Administration Bureau once told reporters: In the future, these military ranches will be working schools, management will be militarized, life will be familialized, operations will be scientized, and handling affairs will be rationalized. Their only hope, as a group of unsung heroes, is to lay the foundation for China's horse administration through their hard work!</p>

<h3 id="e116">Democracy <a href="#e116" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c116" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">116</a></h3>
<p>— Wu Yong</p>
<p>The resentment expressed by people today indicates, on the one hand, an underestimation of their own strength, and on the other hand, an overestimation of the strength of others. The person who is most full of resentment today is actually the one who is most dependent on others and most reveres others as gods. Today, we all say that democracy is good, but we do not know that this kind of resentful mentality is contrary to the spirit of democracy. Democracy means that the majority of people exert power; the focus is on each individual, not on a part of the people. Resenting only shows laziness and uselessness, and has nothing to do with democracy.</p>
<p>Democracy is like acting in a play. The leading role is important, but the supporting roles and extras are also important. Even those who play the qin, beat the drums, and strike the coins must cooperate properly so that the performance can be compact and exciting. In a democratic play, there should be no spectators in the audience. The entire theater is the stage, and the spectators are the actors. The actors are the spectators. Whether the performance is good or bad cannot be blamed on the leading role alone. But thinking about our country, there have been sages and perfect people, heroes and outstanding individuals throughout the ages. These outstanding talents are superior to the average people of any country today, but what use is it for our country to have these few sages, perfect people, heroes, and outstanding individuals? What impact has it ever had on the general public's intelligence and morality? Confucius and Mencius were indeed sages and virtuous, but in reality, it was as if they had never existed. Conversely, looking at a civilization like the United States, haven't there been corrupt officials, heinous thieves, and traitors? However, it still does not hinder its democracy and civilization, only because it is like a clear river. Occasionally, garbage is poured in, and it quickly sinks to the bottom of the river, which does not hinder the water from being clear. It is evident that relying on one or two sages and two or three heroes alone is not of much use. What is important is that the majority of people can practice what they preach. Even if there are two or three chief culprits and great evils in a country, it does not matter much, as long as the majority of people do not cooperate with them and reject and despise them. No matter how heinous they are, they will only be like a turtle turned on its back, and they will definitely have no way to implement their plans.</p>
<p>Furthermore: We all say that China's officialdom is corrupt and dark, and this is naturally undeniable. It's just that we seem to divide the boundary between officials and the people too clearly, as if officials and the people are two completely different animals. Hu Shi's Collected Works quotes The Seven Heroes and Five Gallants: "...Call the names in order, and when they arrived at the Imperial River, everyone did their work according to their rank. Master Zhi took a shovel and scooped up more than anyone else, and threw it farther and faster. The workers next to him said: 'Wang the Second, this is not how you do this work.' Master Zhi said: 'How?' The people next to him said: 'As the saying goes: the emperor's work, do it slowly. If you do it like this, can you eat for a long time?' Master Zhi said: 'If I do it slowly, will they give me food?' The people next to him said: 'It's the same if you do it slowly, will he not give anyone food?' Master Zhi said: 'If that's the case, I'll do it slowly.'" This teasing is true. But are these people who are working for the emperor officials or people? In fact, the other so-called officials are just as the saying goes: put on a cassock and you are a monk, take off the cassock and you are still a layman? "Dragon seed" is really a deceptive statement, and officials do not have "official seed." In that case, why should we who demand democracy set up barriers ourselves?</p>
<p>Therefore, instead of yelling empty slogans, it is better to get up and participate in the play. Otherwise, I'm afraid today will be in vain, and tomorrow will still be in vain. Don't say I didn't warn you.</p>

<p>— Ting Zhi</p>
<p>Since its invention, the telephone has changed many times, but a newly invented telephone has a more important reform, which can be said to be a revolution in telephones. The appearance of the new telephone is similar to a small radio, and the volume can be adjusted freely, with "jacks." Anywhere, as long as the "jack" is plugged in, you can make a call, and the other party's voice has been amplified, just like talking to you in the room. This new telephone can eliminate the fatigue of holding the handset, and allows the person listening to the phone to work with both hands at the same time, and it doesn't matter if you walk around in the room.</p>
<h3 id="e119">Talking About Business Trips <a href="#e119" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c119" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">119</a></h3>
<p>— A Dan</p>
<p>Central and local agencies dispatch personnel to work outside the office for inspection, investigation, meetings, handover, survey, purchase, transportation, escort, and other necessary tasks. This is called a business trip. Public officials regard business trips as a hard chore, some as a good job, not necessarily. It only depends on where the business trip is to, and whether one understands the tricks of the trade.</p>
<p>The so-called hard chore is because of the constraints of the business trip allowance. Currently, a business trip costs ten yuan per day for senior positions, eight yuan for recommended positions, six yuan for appointed positions, four yuan for attendants, and two yuan for workers. This amount includes the cost of meals, accommodation, and miscellaneous expenses for one day. Transportation such as trains and ships also has regulations: first class for senior positions, second class for recommended and appointed positions, and third class for attendants and workers. Special expenses are reimbursed based on actual expenses, and special expenses require receipts as proof.</p>
<p>The 10 yuan per day meal and accommodation allowance for senior positions is definitely not enough. The regulation is to report two days for one day, and four or five days for two days to compensate. The superior and the accounting office (department) know this and do not investigate, because it is impossible to reimburse otherwise.</p>
<p>As for those officials with status on business trips, there are no restrictions on special expenses. In this way, not only do they not lose money, but they also make money. Some even use the name of business trips to go abroad or return to their hometown for a trip, or to purchase goods in a single-gang style to make a profit. This depends on his skills.</p>
<p>The so-called business trip is a good job because they have many tricks, such as arriving at a certain place and talking about the local specialties with the local主管, intentionally or unintentionally, such as Jinhua and Xuanwei ham, Qimen Wuyi Hangzhou tea, Taiwan grass mats and fruits, Guangdong black rubber gauze silk, Shandong white silk, Hunan and Sichuan summer cloth, Jilin ginseng, clam, Northwest carpets, Zhangjiakou mushrooms, Jiangxi porcelain, Duanzhou Huizhou inkstones, etc., they can send a large amount of them. If they say that the hotel is noisy, there are many bedbugs, and it is inconvenient to live and eat, they will be welcomed to live in the agency or guest house, which will save a lot of meal and accommodation expenses. Thinking of sightseeing or other entertainment, someone will guide and accompany them to do whatever they want.</p>
<p>If it is to investigate the disaster situation, if they slightly reveal that the disaster situation here is not serious, they will try to flatter you and ask you to emphasize the severity of the disaster and the vastness of the area in the report. Because in this way, you can get more relief funds and be exempted from some land tax. Otherwise, if the disaster situation is minor, then you will not get any benefits. To draw an analogy, you can cite the rest.</p>
<p>Although the laws and regulations stipulate that officials on business trips cannot accept local hospitality, this is a formality. In fact, it is the opposite. A person on a mission on a business trip is often entertained by all parties, often causing stomach problems and insomnia. Coming back from a business trip, they are mostly fully loaded, and his report does not have to be written by himself. Someone will write a magnificent book for him.</p>
<p>Who says a business trip is not a good job!</p>

<p>— Zhi Bai</p>
<p>The French legal scholar, Chateaubriand, stated, "The greatest emotion is silence and loneliness." Why is this so? It's because words lack spirit, and cannot express one's heart in the slightest. Chinese language teachers often comment on students' papers, saying "words fail to convey the meaning," but they do not realize that the mind is like a monkey and a horse, changing a thousand times in an instant. How can these dull and rigid words fully reveal it? Westerners emphasize the importance of imagery, association, and the "fluidity" of words in poetry, all of which understand the intention of expressing meaning beyond words. The beauty of "Several Green Peaks on the River" is also based on this principle.</p>
<p>Chinese people often say, "One can only speak to those who understand," and "What is valued in mutual understanding is understanding each other's hearts." If one can understand each other without words, why bother with them? It is precisely because they cannot have a tacit understanding that they must leave behind these few lines of text and leave these traces, and the original intention is lost. Now, there are talented people who cannot forget their emotions and fall into the clutches of demons. They pile up these stubborn stones into a Bagua formation to wait for a sympathetic person in the future. If the person they are waiting for arrives, they will only understand it silently and leave, while the talkative people will gather around this pile of stones, gesticulating wildly, spitting everywhere, and talking nonsense about what they have heard, seen, and imagined.</p>
<p>The greatest joy is speechless, and the greatest sorrow is also speechless. Being able to understand others in silence is perhaps gradually entering the right path.</p>
<h3 id="e121">Introducing "A Brief History of China" <a href="#e121" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c121" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">121</a></h3>
<p>— Chu Yukun</p>
<p>The Chinese nation is the oldest nation in East Asia. Not only was it the first to be civilized, with five or six thousand years of glorious history, but its culture and artifacts were also prosperous. Whether it be in literature, philosophy, politics, economics, or law, everything was quite impressive. However, in recent years, due to the gradual eastward expansion of European and American trends, the majority of people are infatuated with the material civilization of Europe and the United States. Some people even advocate for a complete Westernization of their own way of life. This sense of inferiority is not only inexplicable to Chinese people, but also to Europeans and Americans.</p>
<p>However, knowledgeable people in the United Kingdom and the United States do not underestimate the five or six thousand years of culture of the Chinese nation because of the inferiority of the Chinese people. On the contrary, the United States, which has developed its material civilization to the extreme, is most able to appreciate our long-standing Chinese culture. For example, Progressive Party leader Henry Wallace wants to emulate the "New Deal" of Wang Anshi, a great politician of the Song Dynasty in our country. The US Department of Agriculture has also sent many experts to study our country's traditional experience in cultivation to provide reference for the improvement of agriculture in the United States. The mystery of traditional Chinese medicine has aroused infinite surprise from foreigners.</p>
<p>Therefore, Chinese culture, in the eyes of foreigners, is simply an unfathomable enigma. Recently, Mrs. Rogers of the British Council sent me a copy of "A Brief History of China." Judging from its binding alone, the cover is full of "antique" oriental flavor, and we can know that its author, Mr. Goodliffe, has a very deep understanding of Chinese culture. Mr. Goodliffe is currently a professor of Chinese literature at Columbia University and can be said to be one of the Western scholars who understands Chinese culture best. He uses the most concise words to give a comprehensive report on Chinese culture, philosophy, politics, and economics, so that readers can clearly understand Chinese history at a glance. This work is most suitable for foreigners who do not know much about China's national conditions to read, and can make readers easily understand China. This is its characteristic and also its defect, because Chinese cultural history is as vast as the sea, and can never be included in a booklet of more than two hundred pages. In the eyes of our Chinese readers, it will inevitably be incomplete.</p>
<p>It was published in London this year and distributed by Allen &amp; Unwin. The actual selling price is ten shillings and six pence.</p>

<p>— By Wang Jinshan</p>
<h3 id="e123">Learning from Thunder <a href="#e123" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c123" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">123</a></h3>
<p>After reading the photographic images of the Japanese war criminals who were sentenced on the fourth page of the thirteenth edition of this newspaper, I felt a release of pent-up emotions. These evil, dog-like wooden exhibitionists have bullied China for more than a decade and have disrupted the overall situation in the East. Now, one by one, in rows, they are receiving the punishment they deserve, reminding people of their wild shouts of "punishing" China and their ambition to dominate East Asia. Where did their power go? It is truly self-inflicted and Heavenly justice prevails!</p>
<p>These are all "objects of fear" and "objects of disgust," without a doubt, but the depth of the impression varies depending on the experiences and feelings in different places. This great war began with the "September 18th Incident" and opened with the "July 7th Incident," invading the whole of China from the Northeast and Hebei. The one who started the earliest, caused the most trouble, and had the worst reputation was the first one in the front row, Doihara Kenji. His evil deeds were numerous, and he had many nicknames. Westerners called him the Lawrence of the East, and Chinese people called him the real-life "Tu Xing Sun" or "Bandit." After the "September 18th Incident," this person took office and served as the so-called "Mayor of Fengtian" for a short time. Later, he went to Tianjin, where he threatened and coerced Puyi, kidnapped him to the east, and created the puppet Manchuria. The overall situation in the Northeast was entirely under the control of the Japanese puppets. He felt that there was no special drama to play, so he scurried into the Guannei, running to Tianjin, Peiping, Nanjing, Shanghai, and even Guangdong and Guangxi, stirring up trouble everywhere. At first, his movements were secretive, but later he became blatant. Especially during the period of Song Zheyuan's Hebei-Chahar Political Affairs Council, he scurried back and forth between Peiping, Tianjin, and the puppet government of eastern Hebei, strutting about as if there was no one else. People in Peiping and Tianjin covered their noses and ears when they heard that the "Bandit" had arrived. The Hebei-Chahar authorities could do nothing about it either. Secondly, Itagaki and Umezu, two old dwarfs, were the mainstays of the actual invasion before and after the two incidents, but in the minds of the public, they were not as widespread as the "Bandit." Itagaki first instigated the "September 18th Incident," and after the July 7th Incident, he went to the central China area and took military action. Umezu was the commander of the Japanese troops stationed in Tianjin in the Republic of China in 24th year. He was arrogant and overbearing. Later, he became the commander of the Kwantung Army, supervising the puppet Manchuria, and was full of power. After the defeat, he, along with Shigemitsu Aoi, one civil and one military, bowed their heads and signed the surrender on the Allied warship. Shigemitsu Aoi was the monster who had one leg blown off by the Korean patriot Yoon Bong-gil in the "January 28th" Songhu battle. At that time, he almost died, but after being cured, he remained active, serving as the Japanese ambassador to the United Kingdom and the Soviet Union. During the Wang puppet government, he also served as the "Ambassador to China." At that time, he and Nomura were known as one "cripple" and one "blind man" (Nomura was also one of the people who received Yoon Bong-gil's bomb, injuring one eye, but his life was unharmed. He was a naval officer, but he was heavily involved in diplomatic work, and served as Foreign Minister. Before the Pacific War, he served as the ambassador to the United States and handled negotiations with Kurusu until he returned home at the start of the war). As the saying goes, "Things do not exist alone, they must have a pair."</p>
