<h3>蔣主席致詞全文今後政府措施必遵憲法求達民有民治民享目的</h3>
<p>〔本報南京一日電〕蔣主席一日在國大閉幕禮致詞，全文如次：主席，代表諸君：</p>
<p>此次大會，是中華民國施行憲政第一屆國民大會的第一次會議，負有開始行憲的使命，而又適當戡亂建國最艱難的時期，其意義與責任至爲重大，各位代表受全國人民付託之重，一月以來，出席會議，研精單思，極盡辛勞，茲當會議結束，圓滿閉幕，中正謹代表國民政府向各位敬致慰勞之忱。</p>
<p>在行憲以前，我們的中央政府是由訓政達到憲政的國民政府，自今日以後，中央政府是依憲法產生的政府，亦即五十年來—國父領導的國民革命一般志士仁人爲國·爲民·爲三民主義流血犧牲　奮鬥所致力以求實現之行憲政府，今後政府一切措施，必須遵守憲法，以發揮憲法中所賦予其治權之能力，而求達到民有·民治·民享之最大目的。此次大會實僞民主憲政政府依法產生之源，今後更負有行使政權的崇高任務，繼往開來，在歷史上實爲劃時代的創舉。</p>
<p>代表諸君當中，有不少曾經參加過制憲國民大會的，這部憲法制定的過程，各位都是明瞭的，今後行憲的績效，全賴舉國一心，人民與政府，互爲權能的發揮，而尤擊乎人人奉行憲法，以實現民主的精神，貫澈法治的效用。</p>
<p>這次大會由三月廿九日開幕，到今天閉幕，整整經過了一個月的時覜，在開會當中，全國上下，都寄以熱烈的希望，諸位代表受全國國民的選舉和付託，齊集首都，在這一個月的時期，無時不念及全國國民付託之重，謹愼從事，始終不懈，來完成這重大的使命，這種精神，是値得大家欽佩的。</p>
<p>這次大會中各位代表的建議案，統計有數百件之多，充分表達了各地同胞對國計民生殷切的期望，同時也是各位代表關於國家民族忠誠的貢獻，這許多建議案，相信新政府必能尊重公意，儘量採行。</p>
<p>中正自許身革命以來，竭知盡能，排除萬雖，以完成統一建國爲一貫的職志，惟回溯四十年的努力，仍未實現國父的遺志，解除同胞的困苦，正深愧悚。這次行憲政府成立，又蒙寄畀以重任，唯有益加惕勵，秉過去爲國效忠爲民服務，致力於民主憲政與三民主義之實現，謹掬誠奉吿於各位代表，轉達全國父老以及全國同胞，同心同德，相勉相匡，爲中華民國創造光明之前途，謹祝各位健康，謹祝大會成功。</p>

<p>于氏致詞情形（本報攝）</p>
<h3>于右任氏閉幕詞</h3>
<p>〔本報南京一日電〕于右任閉幕詞全文如下：</p>
<p>我們全體代表經過了十六次的大會，國民大會第一屆第一次會議，於此閉幕。右任承主席團之命，担任這次大會的主席，對於本屆大會本次會議使命的完成，表示慶幸之忱，同時對於各位代表曁秘書處內外執事人員在這三十四天之中，備極辛勞，表示感慰之意。</p>
<p>自三十五年十二月國民政府召開國民大會制定憲法，到行憲第一屆國民大會集會，爲時不過一年四個月，在這一短時問內，國民政府制定了十項法規，辦理了各項選舉，完成了還政於民的程序，並在本屆大會開會之前，有周詳的籌備，在火會進行之中，作誠　的招待。本席代表本屆大會，向國民政府表示感佩，我們在此尤其敬仰國民政府蔣主席，他二十年來爲革命抗戰而奮鬥，其目的即在民主憲政的實施，最近三年間，他克服了重重的阻力，使制憲與行憲兩次國民大會得以相繼舉行，對於民主憲政的成功，更是耀煌的貢獻，這是我們今日應該特爲申述的。</p>
<p>本屆大會是依據中華民國憲法而集會的，大會的職權，依憲法第二十七條是選舉總統·副總統和修改憲法，但是本屆大會是行憲的第一屆大會，其使命在於完成民選政府的組織，受國民的付託，保障人民的自由權利，實行憲法所規定的基本國策，並維護民主共和國體，保衛國家的領土主權。本席深信，我全體代表在大會中行使兩項聯權，必同感責任之重大，所以大會選舉總統·副總統的時候，經過了愼重的選擇，實僞天下得人慶。</p>
<p>本屆大會閉幕之後，民選政府谷部門即將次第成立，遵循憲法，行使職權。中華民國從此永爲民有，民治，民事的三民主養民主共和國家。本屆大會際此政權移轉的時期，完成繼往開來的使命，深信代表同人有以自慰。本席仍覺有必須在此陳述者，還有兩點：</p>
<p>第一，中華民國的主權，在於國民全體，必須全體國民伸張其對政治的意見，擔負其對國家的責任，民主政治纔能健全，民選政府纔有力量，所望總統就職之後，五院成立之時，政府應有一新耳目的設施，以取信於人民。人民亦應有萬衆同心的熱忱，以愛護國家。我中華民國纔能保持獨立平等的地位，維護領土主權的完整，古服當前的危機，　迫於富强康樂之域。</p>
<p>第二，憲法是民主政治的綱維，必須全體國民的意見都遵循憲法的軌道，以凝結爲國家的政策，而政府的各種職位，各例部鬥，亦依據憲法的文字與精神，互相配合，互爲制衡，國家政治纔有進步，國家統一纔可保持，所望民選政府成立之後，一切以憲法爲準繩，尤須健全政黨組織，培養法治習慣，納政治於憲政的民主的正軌。</p>
<p>自國父倡導革命，至今五十餘年，辛亥之役，肇造民國的初基，北伐之師，奠定國家的統一，抗日之戰，爭取國際平等，在歷次戰役之中，仁人志士，拋擲了多少頭顱，愛國軍民，流出了多少血汗，最後結晶爲這一部中華民國憲法，我們惟有尊重這部憲法，維護這部憲法，以憲法爲最高的規範，導政治於民主的前途，纔無愧於革命先烈，而有以報命於我四億五千萬同胞之前，而能以拯救水深火熱啼飢號寒之人民，而能以擔負動員戡亂建設新中國之重任，我們振臂高呼，中華民國萬歲。</p>

<h3>行憲後民意機關改組的原則</h3>
<p>— 趙鳳喈</p>
<p>憲法在理論上雖已施行，惟在總統尙未就職以前，其效力實際上在停止狀態中。因此本篇所謂「行憲」，是指總統就職中央各行政機構依憲法改組成立之後。又所謂民意機關，是指省市縣各級政府的議會，中央的國民大會及立法院監察院等不在此限。</p>
<p>現在各省市縣的參議會，無論其議員是憐選　由人民選出，均係臨時性質，不得謂爲正武民意機關。迨行竄以後，各省市縣均須依照憲法制定各級自治法規，成立正式地方議會。各級自治法規最好由各級正式議會自行制定，呈報中央備案，其與憲法及中央法令不致發生抵觸。縣自治法規由省政府備案可矣。我們所談的各級正式民意機關改組的原則，是僞現時民意慶關之所無，而可以糾正現時之流弊。姑爲揭　如下：</p>
<p>（一）各級議會之議員應改為有給職　現時各省市縣參議員均於開會時酌支車馬伙食費，閉會時駐會委員亦酌支車馬伙食費。閉會期間，非駐會委員，概無報酬。有的地方，閉會期間，無駐會委員，各議員均參加各項小組委員會，一星期或二星期開會一次，均不支車馬費，如北平市的參議會即係一例。這種無給職，當然可以减輕地方財政的担負；但結果，參議員非有賢產者，不能充當。資產階級的代議制，現已失其存在之價値。若令無恒產者充當議席，則將　翁之意不在酒，意在招搖敲詐，或藉議員頭　謀得一官半職，轉失代表人民之原意。不然將數衍了事。出言無物。或乘閒到會，簽到就走，別謀生活之路。會外的人往往不了解此種情形，每希望議員先生們多下工夫，多往外面調查事實。多得一點可靠的數字，以免開會發言時，等於無的放矢，或信口漫罵。這一種要求，確屬正當，並非苛刻。要知此種事業，旣非資產階級和有閒階級所願爲，又非無恒產之徒所能爲。此二種人均有所不爲，然則令有職業者兼充議員，可以能勝任矣，此亦有弊，容於下段討論之。總之無給之職，易使從職者入於貪污之途。當今天下，誰能枵腹從公？所以欲求各級議員之能盡心所職，必須給以一定之報酬。</p>
<p>（二）各級議員均不得兼任其他事務現時只限制公務人員不得兼任人民代表，但有給職務而非公務員者，可以兼任之。如國立大學校長成省立中學校長不得兼充省市參議員，而私立學校校長可以兼之。這當然是防止官吏强姦民意，在中國現制認人民代表行使政權，而官吏是行使治權的，尤其要劃分淸白。不過許可其他有職務敏有職業者兼任，其用意無非以省市縣參議員均爲無給職，不得不藉此以作調劑。殊不知使有職務者兼任議員社會上賢者少而不肖者多，彼只知代表其同階級或同　之利益而忽略其他人民之利益，其人品之劣者，又只知代表其私人之利益，更不惜以鄰爲　。試看議會中某某議員之提案與發言，即可推知其職務與所業。其有阡衡大局，關懷全民利益者，爲數極少，且勢成孤立，終不能挽回頹風。故區域代表固不宜以有職業者兼充，即職業代表，亦必使其于就任代表以後，暫辭去或脫離其職業。俾其專心於代表之職守。我們在前而主張議員應爲有給職，此處自應主張其不得兼任其他事務。這兩個原則是相輔而行的。</p>
<p>（三）各級議員名額應儘量减少上而旣主張各級議員均　予以報酬，名額减少，地方負担亦可比例减輕。且由國現狀，人民知識永準尙未達到相當程度，　德亦未見其厚重，其能任人民代表，仗義直言，不畏強暴，以表達民隱者，究屬寥寥無幾。其庸樣者，多旅進旅退，人云亦云。頑劣之徒，只知利用地位，勾結官府以岡私利。人民之利益，則置諸度外。名額少，賢能者可佔百分比之多數。若名額多，則濫竽者衆，而不賢者將佔百分比之多數。再說商討議案而言，人數少意見易於集中，討論時亦有商量之餘地。若人數過多，意見紛歧，會塲上更易被私利輩所操縱，所把持。通過議案，亦多草率從事，未必合經·故將來各級正式幾　之成立，議員名額應儘　减少，如縣議會以一鄉鎭出一代表爲原則；省議會以一縣選一代表爲原　；市議會以每區出一代表爲原則。在此原則下，希望各級政府拿出良心來，爲國求賢，爲民立表。如果因爲議員名　少，政府用統制辦法悉以其位置親朋，反令賢者因額少而被排擠，則殊失　者之原意矣。</p>
<p>（四）各級議會與各同級政府應保持權力平衡將來各級正式議會成立以後，除保有現制之職權外，其與各同級政府之關係，殊可注意。即各級政府之行政首長如由人民直接選舉，其與各該級議會立於如何之地位？如各級政府首長一時不能由人民選舉，暫由上級政府任命時，其與各該級議會之關係又將如何？在前項情形之下，議會議員與政府首長同爲人民所選出，當然均　人民直接負責。人民旣可罷免議員，亦可罷免行政首長。罷免之動議，固均可由人民幾十分之一以上提出，而舉行公民投票。唯行政首長可否請求公民投票以罷免議員？以及議會可否決議請求公民投票以罷免行政首長？凡此問題，均有討論之餘地。就權利制衡之原則言，雙方自均得爲罷色對方之請求或決議。若把中國政權與治權劃分之原則言，議員爲行使政權之代表，固可提議罷免行政首長，而行政首長爲行使治權之機關，似不能請求人民罷免議員。如此則議會之權力將駕　行政首長之上，亦非所宜。爲保　雙方權力平衡計，日僞　　雙方發生最大之磨擦計，以雙方均無請求罷　對方之權爲妥善。不過行憲以後，民選縣長與民選省長市長，恐一時不能辨到。各級行政苜長固得憑藉其上級政府及本身之優越地位，鼓動人民罷免其同級議會之議員，而同級議會依照現制只能於行政首長有違法或失職時，向監察機關舉發之。此亦失民權之制衡，爲補偏救弊計，應予正式議會以直接糾舉各同級行政首長之權，上級行政機關於接到該項糾舉案時，立將被糾畢之行政官交付議處，其淸節重大者應立予停職。</p>
<p>以上各項原則，只就其大者言之，至於細節及立法上技術問題，有待將來正式立法院詳予商討。姑不　述。</p>
<p>總統府三字，昨晨七時已懸於總統府門首，昔日之國民政府，今已更爲總統府矣。</p>

<h3>國大紀程功德圓滿閉幕禮成</h3>
<p>〔本報特寫〕三千位代表，三十四天的集會，已完成了中華民國有史以來的任務。今天，會塲裏，人羣來去，處處是臨別贈言，相約兩年半後再見，　歌唱起，國民大會是閉幕了。吞吐着幾千位代表的大會堂將寂寞的留在首都。這歷史意義的堂皇屋宇，將永遠深入人們的記憶。</p>
<p>今天，從離開會塲開始，憲政已具規模，民主政治的新政府，即將建立，時代的輪子，把訓政時期，投入了歷史的紀錄裏去。</p>
<p>今天，在時間上說，正逢實行節約時間的第一天，提早一小時從今天開始，從代表，到主席團，到大會秘書處，都忙碌着一件在閉幕前最隆里的事件——致送總統副總統當選證書。秘書長幾乎是通夜未眠，事務上的籌劃，如當選證書的騰寫，就讓曾經一手寫成一部憲法的葉秘書，又來了一個夜工，並且八十五位主席團的憲章，就使秘書處不能不連夜趕工，待一切齊備，周鍾嶽先生，于斌先生，全副長袍馬褂穿起時，秘書長方得抱起這隆重的燈書逕向總統和副總統的官邸而去。總統的致送證書並無儀式，道隆軍的過程，僅僅是三鐘就過去。從今天開始，國家元首第一次從人民的手裏取得他管理人民的資格，也可以說，從今天開始，國家的元首，才眞正是人民的公僕，受人民之付託而管理政事。總統說得好：「我一定秉承公意爲國家效力」。這是元首接受人民付託的第一次答語。這個時間是民國卅七年五月一日上午九時四十分，至四十三分。</p>
<p>大會閉幕式是十時三十五分開始，當洪蘭友秘書長宣吿大會由于右任担任主席時，會塲燈光通明，于右老白髯飄飄，緩緩的迎着燈光就主席位，全塲一片掌聲，繼而蔣主席於十時卅九分從邊門入，全塲繼報以熱烈掌聲。行禮如儀後，于右老和蔣主席先後致詞，臺下靜肅傾聽，當蔣主席最後講到「爲中華民國創造光明之前途」時，代表們似荷重大責任，以瞻望前途之光明。當十時五十五分宣吿禮成時，蔣主席和于右老會經一再禮讓步下主席座次。而中華民國萬歲三呼，更增加了大會閉幕禮的盛况。</p>
<p>在廿分鐘的閉幕禮結束後，代表們陸續離去會堂，十幾個進出口的朱紅大門，送走了三千位代表，燈光漸漸的黯了，門慢慢的闔了。走出來，還有留念的拍照和敬賜墨寶的簽名題詞。代表，和大會記者分別領到了紀念章後，就開始了交通組的登記，分別言旋。</p>
<p>大會的成就是可歌頌的，不分黨派，不論中外，他們對滬大會的觀感都是一致認爲可表滿意。爲的是人數多，時間匆促，地點小，旣不應該阻止人的發言，又不能擴展時日，會塲狹窄，不能培養人的情緒，因此雖然在三十四天之中，曾經有過幾次近於紛擾的事件，但是到結果時，還是功德圓滿，要做的都做了，而且是達成任務，何况我們不過是一個初步的試驗？誇大的說，這種成就已經昭示了民主政治前途的光輝，滋試驗是成功的！</p>

<h3>軍事援助西歐美正草擬計劃</h3>

<p>該法案正由國務院起草中，據悉軍火援歐係根據軍事援助條例，按此項條例原由參院書入馬歇爾計劃中，而當時國務院以軍事條款之附於經濟援助內，恐爲共黨於義大選前發佈破壞性宣傳之憑藉，乃要求匯會加以删去。康納利並謂，渠曾於廿八日與副國務卿洛維特討論此計劃，然不能公佈談話詳情，雖此計劃尙未屆水到渠成之階段，但渠預料不久即可完成。</p>

<h3>美孚運油船　進口受檢查　兩尸葬大海　發現大宗煙土</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕駛滬途中發現兩華籍般員屍首及大宗私貨之美孚油公司還油船『查理梅葉」號巳於昨日淸晨乘漲潮時駛入吳淞口，停泊於浦東美孚碼頭。海關查緝員，關警，海港檢疫人員於該輪駛經吳淞口時即乘小艇登輪檢查，美孚公司船務部經理勞傑斯反英國領事署秘書侯立德亦同往調查。船上發現之私貨係鴉片四大包，計重一百五十三磅，約値金條百餘根之巨。華籍船以兩人之屍體則已於發現後立即由船主根據航海法下令海葬，擲於南海之中船上人員衆口一詞，認爲巨額鴉片即係死去之兩華籍船員所偷運，彼等之死因乃爲藏匿鴉片而進入緊閉不通風之水閘中，吸入污穢突氣凶而中毒致死。</p>
<p>「查理梅葉」號重一萬四千噸，吃水三十餘呎。三月底自波斯灣出發運油東來，四月中經過孟買，二十五日發現屍體及鴉片。船上共有船員六十四人，其中華　者僅死者兩人，姓名爲　宗蘇與阿喜（均爲音譯），前者在船上之職位爲機械裝配工匠，已工作一年後者爲木匠，工作尙僅一月，據悉均係在印度孟買僱用者。兩人屍體發現之處，係在船身右側介於油庫與引擊間之由爲安全而設之箱形水閘中，此水間在甲板之下，深可數丈，內部積水，出口處爲一僅可容身之圓筒，凸出於甲板上，平時有蓋深閉，故內部穢氣　　，入內即有生命之危。</p>
<h3>發覺失蹤　滿船搜查</h3>
<p>據船主辛潑生報吿發現兩人屍體及鴉片之經過稱：「四月二十五日早晨九時，船正駛行海中，余接報吿稱阿喜與戴宗蘇兩人業已失蹤，因早餐時不見彼兩人前來進餐，廚司四處尋覓，不見蹤跡。余乃立即召集全體船員，下令分頭搜尋。正機師格龍目先發現船身右側箱形水閘之圓蓋集已掀開，有繩一根一端緊縛於近旁之煤艙管上，一端垂入水閘之內，探視之下，木匠阿喜縣宕於水閘底部，繩索縛於腋下，乃即將其拖起，則屍體業已僵硬。其後再由副機師瓊生戴防毒面具後進入水閘中搜尋，發現載宗蘇躺於離船底約十八吋之水中，乃亦用　將其吊起，撫之亦已僵硬，</p>
<h3>兩尸均無傷痕</h3>
<p>兩屍顯然均死去多時，身上並無遭受强暴行爲之痕跡。在水閘中再繼續搜索之下又發現兩人所用之電炬，余乃想到兩人所以進人水閘或爲藏匿某種私貨，其後在彼等臥室內搜查果然發現鴉片四包，計　一五三磅。余認爲彼兩人係在二十四日至二十五日間之深夜爲擬藏匿私貨，進入充滿積宿空氣及污水沼氣之水閘中，因而中毒致死。其屍體旋於上午十時四十五分海葬於北緯一二·四四度，東經一一一·三四度之海中。二十六日並再下令將全船各處搜查，並無他物發現」云。</p>

<h3>所獲鴉片　將解警局</h3>
<p>海關人員昨在全船嚴加搜查，亦無其他發現。鴉片百餘磅將於明日解繳警察局禁毒委員會處理，此項鴉片據悉質地極佳，可能即係在船過孟買時私携上船，爲這地之印土。至於是否確爲兩華籍船員夾帶，彼等之死因是否另有隱情，因屍體且已葬諸大海，故捨船長之報吿外無法探索其謎矣</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕本市聯合拍賣行受江海關委托，於前日上午在益中拍賣行拍賣一枚名貴之玫瑰紅長方形金剛鑽石，計重五·八四克拉，經在傷主顧數度緊張之喊價後，終爲任　怡和洋行進口部之蔣振餘以國幣三十四億元購得，此款若按掛牌外匯計算，則値美金一萬另六百三十七元五角，或英鎊三千五百四十六鎊。據悉：蔣氏有收集鑽石之癖，渠於民國廿四年開始收集各種超等鑽石，現已積得共二百克拉之多，其中有三枚最大，每粒計重六克拉，此次所購得玫瑰紅金剛鑽，蔣氏認爲係稀有之物，將以之　與其媳。渠對於鑽石頗有研究，稻續石具藍白色者爲最貴重，純白或黃色者則極普通。。</p>
<p>按上述紅鑽於拍賣時，由蔣氏首先喊價爲十五億元，經其他顧客相繼急追，後蔣氏喊至三十三億元，主拍人正擬敲定時，一珠寶商立刻加高五千萬元，最後蔣氏喊三十四億，睹其狀似仍等待挑戰，但已無人應戰矣。</p>
<h3>二百輛列車遊行　工界慶祝勞動節　黨政各首長到會相繼致詞助勉</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕昨日爲五一勞動節，本市八十萬工友，一律休假，歡度此偉大節日。市總工會主持之慶祝大會，於上午九時假座牛莊路中國大戲院隆重舉行，到黨政首長及各工會代表一千餘人，下午化裝列車遊行，情緒熱烈，秩序良好。</p>
<p>晨七時牛莊路上車水馬龍，工友臨時所組織之料察團全體出動，協助警察維持秩序。大會主席團水祥雲，周學湘，方如升，章祝三，葉翔臯，耿介先，仇長江，范才睽等均於八時前到會，來賓中以吳市長到達最早，其後有中央農工部副部長陸京士，國民黨市黨部主任委員方治，秘書長謝仁釗，社會局局長吳開先，勞工處處長沈鼎，國際勞工局程分局長，英國勞工參贊亨脫，美國基督教代表瓊斯，阿根廷勞工參贊戴拉多來等，均先後到會。</p>
<p>充分發展民族工業</p>
<p>大會於總幹事梁永章主持下開始，主席水祥　首先致詞，發表感想四點：（一）世界現有兩大　流，一爲民主，和平，自由，一爲共產　　權，暴虐。工友應在此兩大思想由自行抉擇，我們所需要的是安定與和平建設，如不打倒共產主義，即無法安居樂業。（二）政治方面：我們不能諱言，對現狀確有若千不滿，例如少數貪官污吏，魚肉人民，對這些污史，我們非打倒不可，我們希望在行憲後之新政府，定能一改　去之敷衍塞賣，向革新之途邁進。（三）經濟方面：因我國生產落後，更需要勞資合作，增加生產，我們要打倒豪門資本，官僚資本，及操縱囤積的奸商，使民族工業有充份發展的機會。（四）工人本身：因依生活指數計薪後，工人生活確已較前改進，這是國民黨之勞工政策，勞工界地位在行憲後之中國更顯得重要，三民主義中的民生主義要澈底實行，工會本身亦應努力學習。</p>
<p>要在安定中求進步</p>
<p>繼由吳市長致詞，略謂工界同胞是安定上海之最大力世，目前中國要在安定中求進步，而不是破壞中求改眾。中國目前之戰亂，是由於共匪之破壞，但今天我們可以說光明在望，這可分三方而來說：（一）民主與共產之善惡已日漸分明，最近共匪企圖破壞本市之電力工廠，不顧市民生活，不顧工廠生產，其手段之卑劣與毒辣，已爲市民所共知，共匪之陰謀已經暴露。（二）最近向本市治安機關自首之共匪達卅多人，此種現象，表示共匪本身信仰已經動搖。（三）政府決心改革政治，澈底實行民主。方主委致詞稱：本屆勞動　適逢民主　始，勞工神聖地位已經確定，勞工福利更應完善建立，勞工教育尤其車要，工界應一致團結，不被共匪利用，不被分化、在全國總工會領導下共同努力爲民主建設。</p>
<p>分化陰謀無從施展</p>
<p>陸副部長稱：我國勞工一年比一年進步，今後要更進一步組織，發揮力量，對戡亂建國作偉大貢獻。吳開先局畏稱：全國總工會成立，在我國整個工運　爲光輝的一頁，勝利後政府堅主工資以生活指數計算，工人生活得有保障，生產秩序得以安定，因此共匪之分化破壞陰謀無從施展，今後工界更應團結，加强組織，驅逐陰謀份子，退出工界。繼白工界代表瞿漢民等致答詞，博得全塲掌聲。次通渦電賀蔣主席及李宗仁將軍當選正副大總統，致電各國工會慶賀勞動節，及大會宣言，吿工友書。最後由水祥雲主席主持工界乒乓球聯賽給獎典禮，禮畢，呼口號散會，時爲十一時卅分，</p>
<h3>鑼鼓喧天　高呼口號</h3>
<p>化裝列車遊行原定於下午二時起在南市蓬萊市塲集　惟午後天氣突變、濃雲密佈，預防下雨，特提早於一時四十分即開始遊行，共到卡車二〇九輛，每輛均高搭彩排，分飾飛機，地球，車輪，及各工業出品，以象微勞工之偉大，車中羅鼓喧天，沿途張貼標語，分發傳單，高呼口號，從蓬萊路出發，經老西門，西藏南路，大世界，愛多亞路，外白渡橋，楊樹浦路，華德路，乍浦路橋，北京路，江西珞，南京路，戈登路，勞勃生路，曹家渡，極司非而路，靜安寺路，善鐘路，霞飛路，入仙橋，仍回　處散去。雖大雨傾盆，遊行卡車並不中輟，惟過大光明影院時，中紡第一針織廠之卡車，因煞車　慢，撞及前輛卡車，工友一人受傷。當經救護車送中美醫院醫治。</p>

<h3>出口結匯逐漸減少　主管機關正考慮補救辦法</h3>
<p>頃據有關方面悉：出口物資，結匯數目，已逐漸减少。過去平均每月結匯爲一千三百四十萬美元，上月卽形銳减。據非正式估計，四月份結匯數字，尙不及一千萬美金。此中原因有二：（一）外匯牌價過低，狡點之出口商，大多冒險走私，（一）且有不少出口商，與外國進口商勾結，報低國外市價，逃道外匯。此種現象，若不設法戰止，國家損失奇重，聯合徽信所記者特以此事之補救辦法，走訪出口業某鉅子徵詢意見，據謂：第一，仍主實行出口簽證辦法，以杜價格報低流弊，但走私之風，恐愈嚴厲。第二，實行進出口迎鎖辦法，出口外匯，保留一部份購進國內需要物資，輸出品製造原料進口辦法，及包裝材料進口辦法，應擴及農產品，但亦易釀起黑市之波動。第三，採出口物資最低結匯辦法，參照國內外市價及掛牌匯率，每週訂定，其標準須照國外市偎略低，使出口商獲得一部差價外匯，此較爲切合實際之辦法，開主管機關，對是項意見，正考慮中。</p>
<h3>南北市米價回漲　麵粉雜糧食油均跟進</h3>
<p>米市因本月份戶口米價格提高，及份量反見减低，故市塲人心堅昂。加以無錫連續報升。執貨者更緊緊扳價，初市曾喊高二十至三十萬元，惟以價漲過昂，本街不敢貿然而進，旋即回落。北市塲粳薄稻，秈米終漲二十萬元，白粳出四百萬而達四百十五萬元，特高粳做高爲四百三十五萬元，南市塲早漲二十萬，後退小十萬，軋漲十萬元。惟收市後聞北市漲多，乃再喊高五萬元。昨日到貨五千四百五十二石。</p>
<p>麵粉</p>
<p>晨開貨主即乘機力圖扳高，實銷亦急起補取，兵船老車紅蜂建成以及雜牌粉均出一百四十萬外。麩皮跟升二萬五千，小麥仍爲二百萬原盤。</p>
<p>雜糧</p>
<p>大都挺升。黃豆上升十萬至十五萬元，苞米挺五萬，紅糧亦升五萬，菉豆止跌轉漲，挺十餘萬，生仁廣帮力取，秦皇島貨出八百萬外，計漲五十五萬，揀靑疲，芝蔴津帮不取，獨降十五萬元。</p>
<p>食油普遍上挺，油廠開價見高，更以戶口油價之提高，散戶心思濃厚，吸多吐少，回籠貨雖有吐出，然銷路甚好。大有豆油在八百七十八萬，計漲二十八萬元，吉桶生油復出千萬大關，收市一千〇五萬元，軋漲二十五萬，生菜油挺二十五萬，小車蘇油客帮不納，上漲最微，僅挺五萬元。豆餅散戶客帮均吸進，加三四萬元。</p>
<h3>各地商情</h3>
<p>蘇州</p>
<p>〔本報蘇州一日電〕蘇州今日米價又漲，蓋因鄰邑無錫價格高昂，四鄉米糧紛紛改運，四境來源稀少，執貨者乘機抬高。市塲做開糙粳三六〇萬元，白粳四二五萬元，門售白米四三〇萬元，創新紀錄。</p>

<h3>國外桐油市況　本周仍極疲軟</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕中信局收購桐油價格，自於本月廿六日提高爲每担九五〇萬元後，一週內計收購五五〇噸。內銷雖有零星交易，但爲數不大。四月份內共已收購一六三〇噸。</p>
<p>〔又訊〕中信局易貨處發表桐油猪鬃本週市况稱，桐油國外市况仍極疲軟，紐約現貨每磅二角三分又二分之一，合　　　價爲二角二分又二分之一。惟因華南走私出口之桐油，已足供美國需要，故市面迄未見好轉。</p>
<p>猪鬃國外市况尙佳，惟索價益高，美國刷廠不敢多購，幸供給量不多，故勉稱平穩。</p>

<h3>華股昨臨收見疲　統債續跌外股又見新高峰</h3>
<p>華股昨形恍惚，開收見疲，中途仍被港電及圈外刺激所激漲。華豐新股漲停於先，國貨增資，下週一暫停貿賣，亦達漲限</p>
<p>晨開永紗爲二二五〇元新高峯，回到二一八〇元再升至二二一〇元。外匯仍平，二〇七號等賣到二一五五元，二一八號等購買，微升爲二一七五元。八九號等再售，代辦費開高爲十九元及二二元，二二號等紛購，港電慘縮，外股又俏，回漲到二二三五元高價。二一八號一〇七號等爭相脫售，午收竟迫降至二一四〇元低價。華豊國貨相繼漲停板而餘股咸被帶小。較前收計華豊園貨漲停板，信誼商務尙平，麗安中法微升，餘均微挫。塲外各未上市股票平穩。</p>
<p>公債昨繼續下游，統丙盛開一六萬元，高價十六萬六，低價一五萬一，午收一五萬五，較前收計甲乙丙丁戊各降九千元，成交約五百萬。</p>
<p>外股昨中途以港電再縮，新高峰又見。怡　紗晨開三七六萬，昂至三八六萬，始起回風，午刻退至晨初價掙扎。證券帮及散戶高檔有進，廣帮及洋商則有了結。較前收計怡紗平穩，鋼業跌半成弱，餘均微降。</p>
<h3>平水龍井上市</h3>
<p>紹興平水所產之龍井，本年度新貨，昨市同業間已有開做，每担爲二千三百萬元，價格尙稱穩定。餘如溫杭兩產區之新龍井，終因到貨多而品質次，脚地岌岌可危。此外各式陳茶，存底枯涸，執主堅持，行情咸帶堅化，且尤以祁門陳花香及茶末，在本街力搜中，市程迂迴益俏。至於洋莊茶市，吐納各懷猶豫，依然岑靜不變。</p>

<p>昨日棉布市况，晨開人心挺俏，北帮收購四君子元嗶嘰現貨約千餘疋，市價一路哄高至四百九十二萬元。嗣因布商絡續供售，並傳紡建公司亦有供售元嗶嘰，終以四百八十萬元收市，比上日社升六萬元。十二磅龍頭細布在本客搜求下，最高達五百十六萬元。旋因業中人有套買，中下檔細布遂回落至五百零三萬元結束，較上日再挺三萬。其餘各布市價亦均挺秀。</p>

<h3>增資股款收據上市問題</h3>
<p>— 杜瑞祥</p>
<p>凡股份有限公司之組織，値茲通貨膨脹之時，如欲發行公司債，殊不足以引起投資者之興趣。而向銀行貸款，不僅須負祖巨額利息，抑且極難取得，故惟向股東增加資本，以應需要。增加資本，添募新股，應經股東會議決。而收足新股，尙須召開新舊股東會，以至請准變更登記，領得部照，換發股票後上市買賣。其間自決議增資至上市買賣，少則三月，多則半年，影饗於股票之流通性甚大，甚或有於每次增加資本時，將前發老股票全部收回，掉換股款收據。旣係收據而非股票，未可上市買賣，以往上海證交鑒於此種實際困難情形，曾參照民法規定預約轉讓辦法，訂明於交易所營業細則，奉准施行。至三十六年底限期屆滿後，於卅七年一月由財經兩部制定上市公司股份預約轉讓辦法限期屆滿，處理辦法六項，其第六項規定：「自文到之日起，凡新向該所報告增資，或依工礦運輸事業重估固定資產價値調整資本辦法，估價增資者，非經呈准變更登記及換發新股票後，不得就其增資後之股數上市。」</p>
<p>照上開辦法第六項末段「不得就其增資後之股數上市」，驟視之，在聲請變更登記期內，因未換發新股票而必須完全停止上市。但照辦法第四項後段「一律暫照未增資前原股數上市」，則知增資前之老股票無不可以上市買賣。查公司法第二百五十七條第二項「未經登記前，不得發行新股票，或爲新股份之轉讓」，足證新股份之轉讓，非於呈准變更登記後，憑新股票上市買賣不可。至於增資前之老股票，並無不得轉讓之規定，更無須與增資後之新股一起上市之限制。</p>
<p>最近財經二部又復制定前開辦法第六項之補充規定，增資新股於呈報經濟部核准後，可以下列方式之一上市買賣，（一）將原股票附帶增資股款收據爲買賣，（二）在股票上加註載明增資事項，仍以原股票爲買賣，（三）增資股款收據載明暫無股權與股票分開爲除權買賣。觀於上開第一第二兩種方式，一係將原股票附帶增資股款收據爲買賣，一係在原股票上，載明增資事項，仍以原股票爲買賣。其所爲買賣，實係老股票與新股份之混合買賣也。其第三種方式，似係指增資股款收據，未經登記前不能過戶，亦不能參加股東會行使股權，但可與老股票分開而爲除權買賣，仍屬有背公司法第二百五十七條第二項「未經登記前不得發行新股票或爲新股份之轉讓」之規定。且旣准許其上市買賣，而又限制其不能過戶，不能參加股東會，行使股權，安得謂爲事理之平。且就文字以爲解釋「股權」二字，當係指股東權利之略語。查股東對於公司之權利，極爲繁頤，若依權利之標的以爲分類，則有自益權與共益權之分。所謂「暫無股權」者，如係指暫無全部股權而言，則增資股款收據等於廢紙。如係指暫無股票更換名義之請求權，及出席股東會行使表決權等，則又未之明言。况股東對於公司之權利爲公司法明文所賦予，何可使執有股份者，剝奪其股權，使無復有股份者，仍有股權，實爲情理所難通。又其所稱除權買賣，就上文以爲觀察，則爲除去股權之買賣，與通俗所謂除去認股權利之買賣及除去股息紅利之買賣亦屬大不相同。與其如此牽强規定，而公司於必要時，召開股東會困難叢生，甚或爲人操縱，轉滋流弊，誠不若回復當初所定預約轉讓辦法，使新股得能上市買賣之爲愈也</p>

<h3>全運花絮　波濤洶涌中徐亨營救陳策</h3>
<p>足籃排泳全能遝動名手徐亨，這次經海軍桂總司令之邀，担任海軍參加全運會代表隊的副總領隊兼指導。他說：要是項目時問不衝突，樣樣都要玩一下。</p>
<p>如果時間不允許，他最喜歡的游泳，還是決定要參加的。他自由式泳的實力，據去年的測騐，五十公尺是廿七秒八，百公尺是六十五六秒。</p>
<p>他說：本屆短距離泳實力最強的，就目前所見到的，該推印尼，香港，廣州三單位的代表。强敵當前，他將戮力一拚。</p>
<p>他運動一早就出道，十七歲時，就代表中國排球隊出席八屆遠運會，打的是前排右，結果得了錦標。九屆遠運會，又入選中國足球隊代表，踢的是球門，也得了錦標。兩個錦標，都是中國在兩次遠運會裏僅得的錦標，豈非巧合。</p>
<p>香港被日敵攻陷後，幾條僅餘的小艦，突團而出，結果被敵砲轟沉了。波濤汹湧中，他鎭靜地運用他游泳的天才，救出了陳策司令，港代理總督麥道高，和其他高級人員二十餘人，英政府因此頒贈他一個大勳章。</p>
<p>談起海軍球類實力，他認爲籃球隊較强。他特地指出劉政軍，于瑞章，劉景行，馬燦希等幾位健將，大有希望在全運會打到複決賽階段。</p>
<p>對戰後體育的沒落，他甚感遺憾。對老運動家的漸趨凋零，尤感滄桑。他說：以我國出席四屆球運會排球代表隊的隊員而言，目前仍能活動於運動塲者，祇賸下他和廣　，李福申三人。</p>
<p>他理年卅七歲，身畏六呎二吋，體重一九〇磅，壯健年靑，仍像小夥子，難怪他過去有許多羅曼史。他說他沒有任何嗜好，所以靑春常駐。不過，他承認現在運動的機會漸少，身體有些發胖了。</p>
<p>他的海軍官銜是中校，做過永寗艦第一任艦長，現在暫時棄軍從商，和蔡演雄合作，做做暹羅的木材生意。</p>
<p>籃球名後衛上屆世運選手蔡演雄，他高速度的運球術和守衛術，是一向膾炙人口的，籃壇飲譽十餘年，初非倖致，他這次仍是上海隊的后衛。</p>
<p>照他看，上海體壇裏年來僅有的進步跡象，該推籃球了。他說；這還是得力於美陸海軍和菲島等外來球隊不斷的切磋和觀摩，使上海籃球隊，逐步注入了新的血液。</p>
<p>他認爲上海籃球隊的實力，依然强勁。將來唯一的勁敵，將是菲律賓。</p>
<p>對於女籃球，他不敢妄下斷語。不過，他認爲上海·印尼，粵穗等隊，倒是勢均力敵的。</p>
<p>前天，住在揚子飯店裏的僑胞選手一百餘人，由歸僑招待主任廖烈進倍同，分乘四輛大客車，參觀光中染織廠，每人得贈品女旗袍料一件，女選手自用，男選手留給太太或愛人。</p>
<p>廖烈進說：離開大會揭幕，還有好幾天，他煞費躊躇，想替僑胞選手們安頓下個消遺的節目，以便身心有所寄託。參觀光中，不過是個開端。</p>
<p>四號下午三點，歡迎歸僑代表委會將在麗都花園，舉行一個盛大的歡迎會，由主席黃浴沂主持一切。</p>
<p>看看節目單，巳知的有章國靈的小提琴獨奏，贈旗，陳麗貞女高音獨唱，許綿淸南洋歌，劉美英足尖舞等，總之，保險精彩熟烈。</p>
<p>暹羅代表隊，今天下午二時許，將從香港飛來。道一隊的特色，由文化體育界熱心人士，負責籌募參加經費。與一般由富賈巨紳發起主持的代表隊，截然不同。</p>
<p>例如：暹隊的總領隊　其雄，是暹華體育總會和報界公會的理事長，中原日報的總經理。暹隊籌委會主席鄭午樓，是暹救濟祖國糧荒總會的主席，證明文人也是帶得了兵的。</p>
<p>暹隊　最値得頸吿的，有女俯泳健將洪瑟瑟，二百公尺俯泳，有三分四十五秒的成績，接近全國紀錄，屆時當可一顯身手。</p>

<h3>罵人</h3>
<p>— 靖文</p>
<p>關於罵人一事，似乎迄朱有人研究過其起源。據　意推測，大概罵人係發源於批評，或說是批評的旁支。批評而趨於尖刻，毀謗，那就近乎罵人了。現在各報的讀者信　欄，編者每聲明凡個人攻訐和揭人險私一類的東西是不予刊載的，這意思也就是說批評雖然可以，罵人則不可以。</p>
<p>罵人雖然也許是導源於批評，不過兩者的意默是不同的。批評的對象一般都是就事論事，即使偶有涉及人身之處，大概也都起因於事件。至於罵人，則顯然完全是屬於感情的東西。一個人在開口罵人的時候，無非因為理知已至　境，不得不求感情逞快。不過像三國演義上的彌衡罵曹操，諸葛亮罵王朗，則雖曰是罵，實則是諷刺。</p>
<p>諷刺自然也是屬於批評範疇的東西，其與罵的不同處，是前者猶如蜜蜂的針尾，比較隱藏，且亦不是無的放矢；至於罵人，則類於惡狗狂吠，雖聲勢洶洶，實則令人僅感討厭。而且聽得多了，就是嚇人的作用亦會消失的。</p>
<p>古今中外每有一輩以狂士自居的人物，好以罵盡蒼生為快。他們對於甚麼事情都不滿意，對於甚麼人都看不起。然而他們除了筆下逞快的漫罵之外，很可能提出合理的批評與具體的主張。至於此輩的私底下生活，恐怕較之他們所詬罵的人物更為缺德。</p>
<p>這倒並不是說罵人的行為全然不可為，人既不能不有愛憎之心，為求發洩憎惡感情，痛痛快快的罵一陣也許不失是一種方法，祗要罵得入情入理，罵得得體，使被罵者覺得無可置辯，叫被罵者覺得心悅誠服，這才是懂得了「罵人的藝術」。</p>
<p>不過罵人究竟不如勸人，因為罵是出於情感的行為，也往往容易引起被罵者心理上的反逆影響。用罵的方法而能發生道義上效果，畢竟很少能舉實例。譬如牆上常見的大烏龜，在上海的弄堂社會中存在也已不知多少年了，然而迄今不僅未獲制裁的效果，反而變做了招徠的廣告。以小喻大，政黨間與國際間敵對陣營的彼此對罵，除了把國事世事弄得更嚴重外，可說一無結果。而且也永遠不會有結果。</p>
<p>人不分智愚賢不肖，大概都有幾分自尊心，也就是人所以為人的自覺心。道裏才是人類社會道義基礎的所在。現在社會上使人感到氣憤的事情是太多了，不但罵不勝罵，且寨半已非一罵所可了之。所謂人心已經開了閘，道義兩字已成為人生慾海中的一葉孤舟。「笑罵由他，我自為之」，差不多已成了現在人生的普遍熊度。</p>
<p>針對此種現象，鄙意認為與其痛罵，不若常常根醒大家：「我們還是人」，或許倒較能發生效果。因為，要是「他」已不視自己為人，則罵也是多餘的。寫到此地，覺得國際飯店上面的［禮義廉恥」四個大字，似乎也應該換為上面所說的「我們是人」四字，才能適合時代的需要。</p>
<h3>借妻</h3>
<p>— 方萍</p>
<p>「出借妻子」在北極冰天雪地裏的愛斯基　民族中是一樁極尋常的事，正如「出借金錢」在其他民族中是極尋常的一樣。而且，他們的出借妻子，比我們的出借金錢要慷慨得多。這有二個原因：第一，這是應遵守的風俗之一；第二，這是一種友誼上應盡的義務。</p>
<p>勞斯基摩人的出借妻子並不索取任何金錢或物質的報酬，也不一定要徵求女方的同意。按照他們的習俗，借妻的請求，應直接向她的丈夫提出，因為他有處置妻子的絕對權利。否則，便決不會有順利的結果。</p>
<p>他們把「出借妻子」這回事看得這樣的尋常：當貴客坐滿冰窖中時，請求人也可隨便說出自己的請求。旁人不會覺得驚異，雙方也不會感到難為情。一個請求，一個答覆，他人旁聽，彷彿在商談一件極平常的交易。</p>
<p>當夜幕降臨，蠟燭燃盡時，那個出借妻子的男人便會獨自爬進皮囊中，而讓妻子伴他人睡覺。三個人同時睡在一個冰窖中，沒有妒忌和憤恨，也不會害羞。整夜都在平安融洽的空氣中。</p>
<p>據說，有些白人也會作過同樣的請求，結果他們都如願以償的受到了與當地人同等的優待。</p>
<p>愛斯基摩人認為出借妻子不但對自己亳無損失，而且對朋友盡了義務；何樂而不為！因此他們絲亳不會吝嗇妻子的出借。但當他明白你不僅想借用，而且竟想佔奪他的妻子時，那他便會毫不留情的殺死你，即使你是他的多年知交。</p>
<h3>「活仙姑」無獨有偶</h3>
<p>— 年仁</p>
<p>日前本報重慶通訊，載該處發現「活仙姑」楊妹，九年不食，生活如常，人皆稱異云云。按此事誠屬希奇，惟並非絕無僅有，吾邑亦曾有類此之事發生，茲誌其經過如下：</p>
<p>敝友處君，業醫，曾為余言：民國二十年間，諸橋附近（海寗城東）有談姓女，年十五六，病傷寒，及愈後，一切體力言行均已恢復如恒，惟不欲穀食，得食即吐，日僅飲開水與水果少許，但不與亦不求；其家初甚憂慮，千方百計，治之無效，更不知其所以然，後以無可奈何，聽其自然，亦無他變，工作如常人，惟兩手掌赤如丹砂，每隔四十餘日一大便。人以為異，莫敢與婚。如是十一年，忽欲思食，遂又飲食如故，現已嫁人生子云。</p>
<p>據上所述，則楊妹他日或能重　飲食，亦未可知，尚望有心人留養之，以觀將來之變化焉。</p>
<p>於此，筆者有一遐想：此次若得科學家研究明白知其所以不食而能生存之理，更進　謀可以人為致之，則療飢有術，辟穀有方，民無稻之憂，食的問題，得告解決，世間紛爭，當可大部寗息。此則或亦獲致世界永久和平之有效方法也。</p>
<h3>談蜜蜂</h3>
<p>— 孺子</p>
<p>蜜蜂在動物的世界裏好像是一個「一勇之夫」，動不動就會「揮拳相向」，總使人不大敢和他親近。「黃蜂尾上針」，不是早就為我們所戒慎恐懼的嗎？</p>
<p>其實，蜜蜂並不如何兇狠可怕，只不過是性子暴躁一點吧了。梅德林克在「蜜蜂的發怒」一文中，就提到：即使是最暴躁的蜜蜂，倘若你先用花蜜去孝敬牠們已經餓　了的肚子，牠們也就會因此失掉了發怒的勇氣。</p>
<p>蜜蜂的性子不甚馴服，這倒是真的。慎莫去惹怒牠！否則，牠決不會赦免牠的仇敵。</p>
<p>然而，蜜蜂的一刺，却會失掉自己的生命。所以，當牠給敵人以「最後的一擊」的時候，牠自己的末日也到了。</p>
<p>正如梅德林克說；「對於某種人，牠有不可克制的憎惡。」雖然這樣因一怒而丟了自己的生命，究竟敢憎敢恨，比之於終日打拱作揖的叩頭虫，小小的蜜蜂就不失是一位可敬的小生物！</p>
<h3>鶴舞詩紀</h3>
<p>— 半夢老人</p>
<p>上海「鶴」不常見，高安路黃岳淵君園中，曾養一隻，據云：年在百齡以上，且能舞蹈。老友錢濛　為余言之，余以詩寄黃君云：「　氈到處笑羊公，偏是黃園訓練工，三疊琴心通款曲，千年玉羽絢寒空。雷門勁骨翹江滸，緱嶺仙姿照海東，只為孤高期絕世，不將佳侶病樊籠。遼天清嘯九皋聞，縞袂玄裳早出羣，　對青峰歸伴我，舟迴赤壁夜逢君，溫來逋客孤山夢，化作蘇仙一朶雲，自愧超塵無逸翮，婆娑老羽翳兵氛。」黃君以為尚可採取，裝潢入冊。</p>
<p>過了幾日，黃君又以紙來索圖，乃為繪舞鶴圖貽之。翌年，始與濛叟往黃園，同觀鶴舞。黃君親自調撥，鶴聽指揮，舞踴中節，足徵訓練有素。時外寇方張，余與濛叟方從通園聽應慈法師講金剛般若經，因得句云：「前有猛虎後毒蛇，猙獰舑膽磨狼牙，奮飛不能苦跼蹐，時對鉗網生咨嗟。突聞獅吼發大聲，妙義絡繹飛天葩，濛叟聽經有餘興，引我黃園踏幽勝。黃園主人風雅倫，滿壁琳瑯花照徑，爛然玉冊斐几陳，藝士才人盡投贈，老夫俚句亦見收，什襲裝潢慚未稱。主人好客兼好鶴，丹頂霜毛多磅礴，華亭清唳無可聞，朱閣仙儀殊不惡；開蘭神竦出雄姿，當階振翮故遲遲，主人招手鶴即舞，進退盤旋中規矩，忽軒忽落忽踞蹲，或為龍跳或鳳蹲，白翹脩頸霜雪糝，黑撲迴翅乾坤翻。可憐珍禽困稻梁，樊龍馴伏如牛羊，九皋天聞今已矣，崚　傲骨徒開張！曷不千仞高飛翔，深山密林歸故鄉？塵世泯棼何足取，依繼斗升　奚補？鶴兮鶴分竟無覩，主人送客鶴入蘭，西風瑟瑟吹羽翰，黃埃漫衢白日殘·歸來為鶴三太息，不容悲鶴還自悲，坐　荒塗留荊棘！」其後未再訪黃園，不知鶴還健在否？</p>
<p>鶴取標格奇俊，唳聲清亮，頸須細而長，足欲瘦而節，身欲人立，背欲直削，方合妙品。蓄鶴園林，必先築廣臺於高岡土壠之上，供其清唳。居鶴以茅庵為最宜，須傍池沼，供其沐浴，飼以魚穀果類，於其饑時，置食空野，使童子拊掌頓足以誘之，習之既熟，一聞拊掌，即便起舞，此即教鶴舞蹈之怯也。在羽禽中，雅潔而可供清玩者，惟鶴為最，青松翠竹間，點綴一二，妙入畫圖。昔孤山林處士以鶴為子，現西湖演尚有放鶴亭卓立千古，真不愧雅人深致。遜清翁松　尚書，失去一鶴，寫「訪鶴」二大字，榜之通衢，書法妙入神品，當時傳為韻事。黃園尚有鸚鵡一頭，惜未能言，鸚鵡宜於紅窗翠閣，不若鶴之清雅，詩人絕少言之，以是故耳。</p>

<p>人們常愛將「長生不老」四個字連在一起，其實，「不老」是幸福，「長生」就難說了。</p>
<p>人與人之間的距離是神奇的，不可捉摸的，有時候，朝夕相見的人如同遠在天邊；那真的遠在天邊，甚至更在天邊之外的人，也有時倒會近在眼前。</p>

<p>— 施叔範</p>
<p>與散木偕「友聲」同人既抵木　，飲於石家飯店，荻芽初抽，　魚未至，　于髯老桂花開天下香時，頗為悵絕！店距　　不遠，塔　　風，如聞　　。明晨，發　口，經伍相　，細雨點蓬，螺黛貼水，七十二峯隨汪洋浮沉，縹緲無既。登石公山，探夕光洞，一路桑拓成陰，雜花綴籬，莫非畫境。坐茅堂試碧螺春，穀雨新培，鼻舌生香。所過有消夏灣，明月坡，皆吳王遺蹟也。東南為林屋洞，亦稱龍洞，旁結草庵，亂後垂垂圯矣。湖岸多編竹為　，張羅魚蝦，無不可觀者。</p>
<p>問誰解得此蕭疏？醉叱紅燈草草書。今古銷魂在衰亂，靈巖脂粉石家魚。</p>
<p>街河載夢　聲微，凟口風吹雨點稀、樹集黃鴉哀古相，山　白浪濕春衣。無心制據漁家　，不管　豐野谷薇；可惜江淮隔蒲柳，夜深總見火雲飛。</p>
<p>浩蕩官湖稅亦忙，天心民力兩微茫，西山茶葉東山橘，更想枇杷五月黃。</p>
<p>豆莢纍纍桑枯清，野花媚客各無名，湖樓茗坐看天下，多少魚龍起不平。</p>
<p>消夏灣頭韈生塵，明月坡前草又春，荒主佞臣妖婦夢，夢中山水付他人。（編者按：施公未免唐突西施。）</p>
<p>古洞潛蛟睡尚酣，此湖好在大江南，松間茶沸驚何世？頭白貧僧泣草庵。</p>
<p>###</p>
<p>吾聞不但首都國大，即各地方之選舉情形，高呼「良心」「良心者」者，屢見屢聞，甚矣「良心」為大眾迫切之要求，亦中外古今之正義也。然從來揭舉「良心」者恒以「天地」相聯屬。除劇場上（寶蓮燈及一棒雪等）之證例外，先賢嘉言懿行，如漢代楊震「四知」，即是此義。他的僚友王密送他黃金十斤，說「暮夜無知者。」楊老先生說：「天知！地知！你知！我知！何謂無知？」這也就是「上有天，下有地，彼此有個良心」之另一種說法。「黃金十斤，」價值當然可觀。不論漢朝生活如何，一斤是十六兩，十斤是一百六十兩，如今應說「十六條。」而楊震先生居然以四個「知」字，輕輕給王先生一個釘子，磁了回去。可見黃金雖貴，總有行市，即使億兆京垓，仍是「數」字而已，至於「良心」則是無價之寶，倘能堅固保持，即用天文數字的金剛鑽石亦換不了去！何况金鈔乎？</p>
<p>古人講「良心」必與「天地」聯合。因「心」之良不良，無可憑信，故須證之天地，即所謂「明有日月，暗有鬼神」，身外的監督相輔而行。但近代破除迷信，現代更無所謂天地鬼神，只仗「良心」二字，亦復脆薄而渺茫。</p>

<h3>悼葉秋原先生　（下）</h3>
<p>— 儲玉坤</p>
<p>二十六年抗戰軍興，葉先生辭去申報記者之職，自滬至港，與吳經熊博士共編英文天下月刋，致力國際宣傳，葉先生仍未脫離新聞記者的崗位。但對於天主教教義的研究，益有心得，再經吳經熊博士的吸引，乃於二十九年在港服贗公教。說也奇怪，過去葉先生是一個反宗教的青年，但是後來信仰公教却比任何人還要篤誠。在香港的時候，曾與吳經熊博士主編甘露叢書，交商務印書館出版，所有名著的選擇與譯者的羅致，都是葉先生主持其事的；惟不久香港陷落，商務港店停閉，至抗戰勝利後，始能印行，現已出版兩冊，一為「哲學概論」，另為「進步與宗教」。</p>
<p>葉先生在香港陷落後才赴重慶，除任立法委員外，並與方杰人司鐸主編真理雜誌，闡揚聖教。不久葉先生應英國文化協會與美國公教學生傳信會之邀，擬赴英美考察各國的公教專業。三十三年六月奉蔣主席之特准出國，至十月十日終於成行了。此行經過印度·澳洲·美國·紐西蘭·愛爾蘭暨英倫等地，一面考察各國的公教事業，一面從事游說，以正國際視聽。葉先生正在倫敦的時侯，日本屈滕無條件投降了，葉先生說從英倫飛往羅馬朝聖，匆匆返國，報告此行經過，著有「朝聖行脚」一書。</p>
<p>卅四年十一月間，葉先生在渝，應申報之聘，與陳訓　先生伺機飛滬，任主筆之職，最初幾月申報的社論，大半是葉先生所撰。葉先生不僅才氣磅礴，而且學識豐富，對於任何問題，均有相當的認識，具有主筆人才所必備的條件。但是他　謙虛，記得有一次國府文官處調查各報的人事，要他填寫一張表格，其中有一欄是：有何特長？他填了「一無所長」四個字；表上又有：有何志願？他又寫了「並無志願」四個字，笑着拿給我看。葉先生對於政治似乎不感興趣，七八年來他出席立法院任何會議，從來沒有說一句話，所以在報紙上也很少看到他的大名，一般人根本就不知道他是立法委員；每次晋京開會，簽了一個到就回來了，我問他南京有什麼消息，他總是搖搖頭，回答說沒有什麼。</p>
<p>葉先生生平無嗜好，但喜歡喝幾杯酒，「馬上俟」常有他的綜跡，引壼獨酌，自得其樂；家庭很美滿，太太也是一個天主教的教徒，身體素來強健，今年二月初患心臟病，還以為是胃病，到公濟醫院才診斷是心臟擴大症。記得有一次，我和方秋葦先生同去看他，他已起身，很愉快的告訴我們：「病好了，不久就可出院，偏勞多日，謝謝呀！」我們談了一刻，就告辭。不過看他滿險黑氣，似乎還需要長期休養，萬萬料不到病好了還會一病不起。葉先生享年四十有二，實在是中國社會的一大損失！</p>

Yu first read aloud the certificate of election for Vice President, and then presented it to Li, who personally accepted it and shook hands with Yu as a gesture of courtesy, without making any remarks. Yu and his party departed after a ten-minute stay at Li Zongren's temporary residence. After Yu and his party presented the certificate of election for Vice President, four students from the Orphanage School, Wu Peihuan, Chen Xuemei, Li Shuming, and Chen Limei, representing the school, presented a banner to Li, which read "Pioneer of Democracy," which was also personally accepted by Li.</p>

<h3>Full Text of Chairman Chiang's Speech: Future Government Measures Must Adhere to the Constitution to Achieve the Goals of "Of the People, By the People, and For the People"</h3>
<p>[Our newspaper, Nanjing, 1st] The full text of Chairman Chiang's speech at the closing ceremony of the National Assembly on the 1st is as follows: Mr. Chairman, Representatives:</p>
<p>This assembly is the first session of the first National Assembly of the Republic of China to implement constitutional government. It bears the mission of initiating constitutional rule and comes at the most difficult time of suppressing rebellion and building the nation. Its significance and responsibility are extremely important. All of you representatives, entrusted with the heavy responsibility by the people of the country, have attended the meetings for a month, studying and deliberating diligently, and exerting yourselves to the utmost. As the meeting concludes and successfully closes, I, Chiang Kai-shek, on behalf of the National Government, extend my sincere appreciation to all of you.</p>
<p>Before the implementation of the constitution, our central government was the National Government, which transitioned from political tutelage to constitutional government. From today onward, the central government is a government established in accordance with the constitution, that is, the constitutional government that the general revolutionaries and patriots who followed Dr. Sun Yat-sen's leadership for fifty years have strived to achieve through bloodshed and sacrifice for the country, for the people, and for the Three Principles of the People. In the future, all government measures must abide by the constitution, so as to give full play to the government's ability to govern as endowed by the constitution, and to achieve the greatest goals of being "of the people, by the people, and for the people." This assembly is truly the source of the lawful establishment of a democratic constitutional government. In the future, it will bear the lofty task of exercising political power, carrying on the past and opening up the future, and is truly an epoch-making initiative in history.</p>
<p>Among the representatives, many have participated in the National Assembly that drafted the constitution. All of you are clear about the process of drafting this constitution. The effectiveness of implementing the constitution in the future depends entirely on the unity of the country, the people and the government, giving full play to their respective powers and abilities. It is especially important that everyone abide by the constitution in order to realize the spirit of democracy and thoroughly implement the effectiveness of the rule of law.</p>
<p>This assembly opened on March 29th and closes today, lasting a full month. During the meeting, the whole country placed ardent hopes on it. All of you representatives, elected and entrusted by the people of the country, gathered in the capital. During this month, you have constantly kept in mind the heavy responsibility entrusted to you by the people of the country, acted cautiously, and remained tireless in order to complete this major mission. This spirit is worthy of everyone's admiration.</p>
<p>In this assembly, the representatives' proposals totaled several hundred, fully expressing the earnest expectations of compatriots from all over the country for national welfare and people's livelihood. At the same time, they are also the loyal contributions of all of you representatives regarding the country and the nation. I believe that the new government will respect public opinion and adopt as many of these proposals as possible.</p>
<p>Since I devoted myself to the revolution, I have exhausted my knowledge and ability to overcome all difficulties in order to fulfill the consistent goal of unifying and building the nation. However, looking back on forty years of efforts, I still have not realized Dr. Sun Yat-sen's legacy and relieved the suffering of my compatriots, which I deeply regret. This time, the establishment of a constitutional government has again been entrusted to me with heavy responsibilities. I can only be more vigilant and diligent, upholding the past spirit of serving the country and the people, and dedicating myself to the realization of democratic constitutionalism and the Three Principles of the People. I respectfully convey this to all of you representatives, and ask you to convey it to the elders and compatriots throughout the country, so that we can be of one heart and one mind, encourage and support each other, and create a bright future for the Republic of China. I wish you all good health and wish the assembly success.</p>
<h3>The Presidium of the National Assembly Holds its Last Meeting</h3>
<p>Discussing the List of Members for the National Economic Research Committee</p>
<p>[Our newspaper, Nanjing, 1st] The Presidium of the National Assembly held its 44th meeting on the evening of the 1st, chaired by Xia Qin, to discuss the list of members for the National Economic Research Committee. The fifty people nominated by the Presidium have been decided upon by Wang Yunwu, Li Wenfan, Xue Dubi, Chen Qitian, and others. However, the lists from various units were only partially submitted on the 1st, with some not yet submitted. It was decided to request the units to submit the lists in writing to the secretariat within ten days, so as to begin the organization. Subsequently, Wang Yunwu proposed that the Secretary-General of the Assembly, the Deputy Secretaries-General, and the staff of the Assembly have worked extremely hard since the beginning of the meeting and should be commended for their efforts. This was unanimously approved. This was the last meeting of the Presidium. When the meeting adjourned, the representatives shook hands and bid farewell, feeling deeply reluctant to part.</p>
<h3>Zhang Zhiben and Others Plan to Form a Constitutional Amendment Research Association</h3>
<p>[Our newspaper, Nanjing, 1st] National representatives Zhang Zhiben, Lin Bin, Shi Shangkuan, and others, in preparation for convening a provisional assembly in the future to exercise the power to amend the constitution, have decided to form a "Constitutional Amendment Research Association." At 3:00 PM on the 1st, they first convened a symposium, attended by dozens of representatives who were free to attend, and decided on several matters: (1) The charter of the association was approved in principle; (2) The representatives who attended today's meeting are all directors, with Zhang Zhiben, Lin Bin, and Shi Shangkuan as conveners; (3) Branches will be established in various regions to solicit information widely. The main points of the association's organization are: A, The sole purpose is to study how to amend the constitution, named the Constitutional Amendment Research Association; B, National representatives may all become members; C, For the purpose of joint research, members may hold symposiums at any time; D, Members' opinions on amending the constitution must be accompanied by detailed reasons and sent to the Nanjing Liaison Office together with relevant information; E, The association must, based on its research results, draft a constitutional amendment draft three months before the opening of the provisional assembly, as preparation for proposing the amendment in accordance with the law at that time.</p>
<h3>Cheng Qian and Others Lead the Organization of the Constitutional Progress Association</h3>
<p>Presenting the Slogan of Comprehensive Reform</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 1st] The Constitutional Progress Association, initiated by General Cheng Qian and the national representatives and campaign team members who supported him in the vice-presidential election, was established in Beijing tonight and issued a declaration. Over eight hundred people attended, including Cheng Qian, He Chengrong, Zhao Hengti, Tang Shizun, He Yaozu, and Liu Wendao, and Zhang Yinwu was elected chairman. The association's organizational charter and declaration were then adopted, and Cheng Qian, He Chengrun, Yuan Changying, Tan Guangmin, Tang Shizun, and others were elected as directors and supervisors. The association's declaration put forward the slogans of "Comprehensive Reform" and "Peaceful Reform," and advocated supporting the national policy of suppressing rebellion and building the nation under the national interest and constitutional principles, and demanded that the rights of the people in the constitution be effectively guaranteed.</p>

<h3>Yu Youren's Closing Remarks</h3>
<p>[Our newspaper, Nanjing, 1st] The full text of Yu Youren's closing remarks is as follows:</p>
<p>After sixteen sessions, our representatives have concluded the first session of the First National Assembly. I, Youren, on behalf of the Presidium, express my congratulations on the completion of the mission of this session of the Assembly, and at the same time express my gratitude to all the representatives and internal and external staff of the Secretariat for their hard work over these thirty-four days.</p>
<p>From the time the National Government convened the National Assembly to enact the constitution in December of the thirty-fifth year to the convening of the first session of the constitutional National Assembly, only one year and four months have passed. Within this short period, the National Government has formulated ten regulations, conducted various elections, completed the process of returning power to the people, and made thorough preparations before the opening of this session of the Assembly, providing sincere hospitality during the proceedings. On behalf of this session of the Assembly, I express my admiration to the National Government. We especially admire Chairman Chiang of the National Government, who has fought for revolution and resistance against aggression for twenty years, with the aim of implementing democratic constitutionalism. In the past three years, he has overcome numerous obstacles to enable the successive holding of the two National Assemblies for constitution-making and constitutional rule, making a brilliant contribution to the success of democratic constitutionalism. This is what we should especially state today.</p>
<p>This session of the Assembly is convened in accordance with the Constitution of the Republic of China. The powers of the Assembly, according to Article 27 of the Constitution, are to elect the President and Vice President and to amend the Constitution. However, this session of the Assembly is the first session of constitutional rule, and its mission is to complete the organization of the elected government, to be entrusted by the people, to protect the people's freedom and rights, to implement the basic national policies stipulated in the Constitution, and to safeguard the democratic republic system and defend the country's territorial sovereignty. I deeply believe that all of our representatives in the Assembly exercising the two joint powers must feel the weight of their responsibility. Therefore, when the Assembly elected the President and Vice President, it went through careful selection, which is truly a cause for celebration for the people of the world.</p>
<p>After the closing of this session of the Assembly, the elected government's various departments will be established one after another, following the Constitution and exercising their powers. From now on, the Republic of China will forever be a democratic republic of the people, by the people, and for the people. This session of the Assembly, at this time of transition of power, has completed the mission of carrying on the past and opening up the future, and I believe that the representatives can take comfort in this. However, I still feel that there are two points that must be stated here:</p>
<p>First, the sovereignty of the Republic of China lies in the entire people. The entire people must express their opinions on politics and shoulder their responsibilities to the country, so that democratic politics can be sound and the elected government can have strength. It is hoped that after the President takes office and the five branches of government are established, the government will have new and refreshing facilities to gain the trust of the people. The people should also have the enthusiasm of unity to love the country. Only then can our Republic of China maintain its independent and equal status, safeguard the integrity of its territorial sovereignty, overcome the current crisis, and strive for a rich, strong, healthy, and happy country.</p>
<p>Second, the Constitution is the backbone of democratic politics. The opinions of the entire people must all follow the track of the Constitution in order to condense into the national policy, and the various positions and departments of the government should also cooperate with each other and check each other in accordance with the text and spirit of the Constitution. Only then can the country's politics progress and the country's unity be maintained. It is hoped that after the elected government is established, everything will be based on the Constitution, and especially that political party organizations will be strengthened, the habit of the rule of law will be cultivated, and politics will be put on the democratic and constitutional track.</p>
<p>Since Dr. Sun Yat-sen advocated revolution, more than fifty years have passed. The Xinhai Revolution laid the initial foundation for the Republic of China, the Northern Expedition laid the foundation for the country's unification, and the War of Resistance Against Japan strived for international equality. In the successive battles, how many heads of patriots and people with lofty ideals have been thrown away, and how much blood and sweat have been shed by patriotic soldiers and civilians. Finally, this Constitution of the Republic of China has been crystallized. We can only respect this Constitution, safeguard this Constitution, use the Constitution as the highest norm, and guide politics to the democratic future, so that we will be worthy of the revolutionary martyrs, and can repay the 450 million compatriots, and can save the people who are suffering in deep waters, and can shoulder the heavy responsibility of mobilizing to suppress the rebellion and build a new China. Let us raise our arms and shout, Long live the Republic of China.</p>

<h3>Sun and Wu, President and Vice President of the Legislative Yuan, Host a Banquet for All Legislators</h3>
<p>[Our newspaper, Nanjing, 1st] The Legislative Yuan of the National Government declared its conclusion on the 1st. President Sun Ke and Vice President Wu Tiecheng specially hosted a banquet for all committee members and staff of the Legislative Yuan at the Overseas Chinese Reception Center at noon. About 400 people attended. During the banquet, Sun said in his speech that the Legislative Yuan was established in the 16th year of the Republic of China. He himself served as the President of the Third Session in the 22nd year and was originally scheduled to complete his term in the 24th year. Later, the central government decided to implement constitutional government in the 26th year, followed by the War of Resistance Against Japan, and he has been re-elected to this day, lasting 16 years in total. Although the Legislative Yuan was not the highest legislative body in the past, it has demonstrated the true spirit of democracy and often made concrete contributions to the central government's decision-making. He hoped that this spirit of democracy would continue to be maintained after the establishment of the new Legislative Yuan. Sun continued to describe his personal life, contributing more than a quarter of his life to the Legislative Yuan, and this quarter was like his useful years. After more than ten years of learning and tempering, he felt that he was capable of this position. However, the responsibility of the Legislative Yuan after the implementation of constitutional government is even greater. Sun expressed that he had no intention of clinging to his position. He had stated that he would give up his position when running for Vice President, and his intention has not changed. He hoped that the central government could make a decision on this matter quickly. Finally, Sun expressed his concern for the incumbent legislators and staff of the Legislative Yuan, saying that 70 of the original legislators were nominated by the central government as legislative candidates, but only half of them were elected. They are all useful talents for the country, and he hoped that they would have the opportunity to serve the country effectively in the future. As for the staff, those who are young and strong can continue to serve in the new Legislative Yuan, and those who are older can retire using the Civil Servant Retirement Law if they do not wish to continue working. After Sun finished his speech, Vice President Wu Tiecheng, Secretary-General Wu Shangying, and Liu Guanxun, the oldest legislator, delivered speeches one after another. The banquet dispersed around 3:00 PM.</p>

<h3>Government Yuan Civil Service Agencies and Schools' Regular Expenses Increased by One Fold; Special Office Expenses for Managers Handled Similarly</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper South No. 2 Dispatch] The Government Yuan's civil service agencies and schools' regular expenses, starting from May, regardless of agency level, will uniformly be increased by one fold based on the deducted amount of the regular expenses approved for the first half of this year and the first supplementary amount. This proposal was passed in the political affairs meeting on the 1st.

<h3>Principles for Reorganizing Representative Bodies After Constitutional Implementation</h3>
<p>— Zhao Fengjie</p>
<p>Although the Constitution has been implemented in theory, its effectiveness is actually suspended until the President is inaugurated. Therefore, the term "constitutional implementation" in this article refers to the period after the President's inauguration and the reorganization and establishment of central administrative bodies in accordance with the Constitution. Furthermore, the term "representative bodies" refers to the assemblies of provinces, cities, and counties at all levels, excluding the National Assembly, Legislative Yuan, and Control Yuan at the central level.</p>
<p>Currently, the assemblies of various provinces, cities, and counties, regardless of whether their members are selected through pity or elected by the people, are temporary in nature and cannot be considered formal representative bodies. After constitutional implementation, all provinces, cities, and counties must formulate local autonomy regulations at all levels in accordance with the Constitution to establish formal local assemblies. It is best for the autonomy regulations at all levels to be formulated by the formal assemblies at each level themselves and submitted to the central government for record, so as to avoid conflicts with the Constitution and central laws. County autonomy regulations can be filed with the provincial government. The principles of reorganizing formal representative bodies at all levels that we are discussing are what current representative bodies lack and can correct current malpractices. We will now reveal them as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Members of assemblies at all levels should be changed to salaried positions. Currently, senators of provinces, cities, and counties are only provided with transportation and meal allowances during meetings. Resident committee members are also provided with transportation and meal allowances during recesses. Non-resident members receive no compensation during recesses. In some places, there are no resident committee members during recesses, and all senators participate in various subcommittees, meeting once a week or every two weeks, without receiving transportation allowances, as is the case with the Beijing Municipal Senate. This unpaid position can certainly reduce the financial burden of local governments; however, as a result, only those with property can serve as senators. The representative system of the bourgeoisie has already lost its value. If those without property are allowed to occupy seats, then the meaning of the "翁" is not in the wine, but in seeking to flaunt and extort, or to obtain an official position by virtue of being a senator, which loses the original intention of representing the people. Otherwise, they will simply go through the motions, saying nothing of substance, or attending meetings at leisure, signing in and leaving, seeking other means of livelihood. People outside the assembly often do not understand this situation, and often hope that the senators will put in more effort, investigate the facts more, and obtain more reliable figures, so as to avoid speaking nonsense or rambling insults during meetings. This kind of request is indeed legitimate and not harsh. It should be known that this kind of undertaking is neither desired by the bourgeoisie and the leisure class, nor is it possible for those without property to do it. Neither of these two kinds of people are willing to do it, so if those with jobs are allowed to serve as senators, can they be competent? This also has its drawbacks, which will be discussed in the next section. In short, an unpaid position easily leads those who hold it to corruption. In today's world, who can serve the public on an empty stomach? Therefore, in order to ensure that senators at all levels can do their best, they must be given a certain amount of compensation.</p>
<p>(2) Members of assemblies at all levels shall not hold other positions concurrently. Currently, only public officials are restricted from concurrently serving as people's representatives, but salaried positions other than public officials may be held concurrently. For example, the president of a national university or the principal of a provincial middle school cannot concurrently serve as a senator of a province or city, but the principal of a private school can. This is, of course, to prevent officials from raping public opinion. In the current system in China, people's representatives exercise political power, while officials exercise administrative power, which must be clearly distinguished. However, allowing others with jobs or those with jobs to serve concurrently is nothing more than an attempt to make adjustments because senators of provinces, cities, and counties are unpaid. Little does one know that allowing those with jobs to serve concurrently means that there are few worthy people in society and many unworthy ones. They only know how to represent the interests of their same class or same　 and ignore the interests of other people. Those with inferior character only know how to represent their own personal interests and do not hesitate to harm their neighbors. Just look at the proposals and speeches of certain senators in the assembly to infer their positions and occupations. There are very few who are concerned with the overall situation and the interests of the entire people, and they are isolated and cannot reverse the declining trend. Therefore, area representatives should not be concurrently held by those with jobs, and even occupational representatives must be required to temporarily resign or leave their jobs after taking office as representatives, so that they can concentrate on their duties as representatives. We advocated earlier that senators should be salaried, and here we should advocate that they should not hold other positions concurrently. These two principles are complementary.</p>
<p>(3) The number of members of assemblies at all levels should be reduced as much as possible. Since we have advocated that members of assemblies at all levels should be given compensation, reducing the number of members can also proportionally reduce the burden on local governments. Furthermore, based on the current situation in the country, the people's knowledge and standards have not reached a considerable level, and their virtues are not thick enough. There are very few who can serve as people's representatives, speak out for justice, and not fear the powerful, so as to express the people's hidden feelings. Most of the mediocre ones advance and retreat with the crowd, echoing others. The stubborn and unruly only know how to use their positions to collude with the government for personal gain. The interests of the people are put aside. When the number of members is small, the worthy ones can account for a larger percentage. If the number of members is large, there will be more incompetent people, and the unworthy will account for a larger percentage. Furthermore, when discussing proposals, fewer people make it easier to focus opinions, and there is also room for discussion. If there are too many people, opinions will diverge, and the venue will be more easily manipulated and controlled by those who seek personal gain. The passage of proposals will also be more hasty and may not be appropriate. Therefore, when the formal assemblies at all levels are established in the future, the number of members should be reduced as much as possible, such as one representative from each township in the county assembly; one representative from each county in the provincial assembly; and one representative from each district in the city assembly. Under this principle, it is hoped that governments at all levels will bring out their conscience, seek talents for the country, and establish tables for the people. If, because the number of members is small, the government uses control methods to fill the positions with relatives and friends, and instead allows the worthy to be squeezed out due to the small number, then the original intention of the　 will be lost.</p>
<p>(4) Assemblies at all levels should maintain a balance of power with governments at the same level. After the formal assemblies at all levels are established in the future, in addition to retaining the existing powers, their relationship with governments at the same level should be given special attention. That is, if the administrative heads of governments at all levels are directly elected by the people, what position will they have in relation to the assemblies at each level? If the heads of governments at all levels cannot be elected by the people for the time being and are temporarily appointed by the higher-level government, what will be the relationship between them and the assemblies at each level? In the former case, the members of the assembly and the heads of the government are both elected by the people and are, of course, directly responsible to the people. The people can not only recall the members of the assembly, but also recall the administrative heads. Motions for recall can be initiated by more than a few tenths of the people, and a referendum can be held. However, can the administrative head request a referendum to recall the members of the assembly? And can the assembly resolve to request a referendum to recall the administrative head? All these issues are open for discussion. From the principle of checks and balances, both parties should have the right to request or resolve to dismiss the other party. If we put the principle of dividing political power and administrative power in China, the members of the assembly are representatives who exercise political power, so they can propose to dismiss the administrative head, while the administrative head is an agency that exercises administrative power, so it seems that it cannot request the people to recall the members of the assembly. In this way, the power of the assembly will be above the administrative head, which is also not appropriate. In order to ensure the balance of power between the two parties, it is proper that neither party has the right to request the dismissal of the other party in order to prevent the greatest friction between the two parties. However, after constitutional implementation, it may not be possible to identify popularly elected county magistrates and popularly elected provincial governors and mayors for a while. Administrative heads at all levels can rely on their superior positions in the higher-level government and their own to mobilize the people to recall the members of the assembly at the same level, while the assembly at the same level can only report violations or dereliction of duty by the administrative head to the supervisory agency in accordance with the current system. This also loses the checks and balances of civil rights. In order to correct deviations and remedy shortcomings, the formal assembly should be given the power to directly impeach the administrative heads at the same level. When the higher-level administrative agency receives the impeachment case, it should immediately hand over the impeached administrative official for deliberation, and those with significant integrity should be suspended from their duties.</p>
<p>The above principles are only discussed in general terms. As for the details and technical issues of legislation, they need to be discussed in detail by the formal Legislative Yuan in the future. We will not elaborate here.</p>
<p>The three characters "Presidential Office" were hung on the gate of the Presidential Office at 7:00 a.m. yesterday. The former National Government has now been changed to the Presidential Office.</p>

<h3>Friction Occurs Among All Circles in Baoding Over the Issue of a Plaque</h3>

The situation may continue to expand and cause major friction between the party, government, business, and the people.</p>

<h3>Successful and Complete Closing Ceremony of the National Assembly</h3>
<p>[Special Report from This Newspaper] Three thousand representatives, a 34-day convention, have completed a mission unprecedented in the history of the Republic of China. Today, in the assembly hall, people come and go, exchanging farewells and promising to meet again in two and a half years. As the songs begin, the National Assembly has concluded. The assembly hall, which accommodated thousands of representatives, will remain lonely in the capital. This magnificent building of historical significance will forever be etched in people's memories.</p>
<p>Today, starting from leaving the assembly hall, constitutional governance has taken shape, and a new government of democratic politics is about to be established. The wheels of time have relegated the period of political tutelage to the records of history.</p>
<p>Today, in terms of time, it is the very first day of implementing daylight saving time. Starting one hour earlier from today, from the representatives to the presidium, to the secretariat of the assembly, everyone is busy with the most solemn event before the closing ceremony—presenting the certificates of election to the President and Vice President. The Secretary-General barely slept all night, and the planning of affairs, such as the transcription of the election certificates, meant that Secretary Ye, who had once single-handedly written a constitution, had another night of work. Furthermore, the charter of the eighty-five members of the presidium meant that the secretariat had to work through the night. Once everything was ready, Mr. Zhou Zhongyue and Mr. Yu Bin, fully dressed in their long gowns and mandarin jackets, the Secretary-General was able to carry the solemn certificates and proceed to the official residences of the President and Vice President. The presentation of the certificate to the President was without ceremony. The entire process took only three minutes. Starting today, the head of state has, for the first time, obtained the qualifications to govern the people from the hands of the people. It can also be said that, starting today, the head of state is truly a public servant of the people, entrusted by the people to administer state affairs. The President put it well: "I will certainly serve the country in accordance with the public will." This is the first response of the head of state to accepting the trust of the people. This time was from 9:40 to 9:43 AM on May 1, the 37th year of the Republic of China.</p>
<p>The closing ceremony of the assembly began at 10:35 AM. When Secretary-General Hong Lanyou announced that Mr. Yu Youren would serve as chairman, the lights in the assembly hall were bright, and the white-bearded Mr. Yu slowly walked towards the chairman's seat, bathed in the light. The entire hall erupted in applause. Then, Chairman Chiang entered from the side door at 10:39 AM, and the entire hall responded with enthusiastic applause. After the formalities were completed, Mr. Yu and Chairman Chiang delivered speeches one after the other. The audience listened quietly. When Chairman Chiang spoke last about "creating a bright future for the Republic of China," the representatives seemed to shoulder a heavy responsibility, looking forward to the brightness of the future. When the ceremony was declared complete at 10:55 AM, Chairman Chiang and Mr. Yu repeatedly yielded precedence as they stepped down from the chairman's seat. The three shouts of "Long live the Republic of China" further enhanced the grandeur of the assembly's closing ceremony.</p>
<p>After the 20-minute closing ceremony ended, the representatives left the assembly hall one after another. The vermilion doors of more than a dozen entrances and exits saw off the three thousand representatives. The lights gradually dimmed, and the doors slowly closed. Outside, there were still commemorative photos being taken and signatures being inscribed on calligraphy pieces requested as souvenirs. After the representatives and assembly reporters received their commemorative badges, they began registering with the transportation group and said goodbye to each other.</p>
<p>The achievements of the assembly are praiseworthy. Regardless of party affiliation, whether Chinese or foreign, their views on the Shanghai assembly were uniformly satisfactory. Because of the large number of people, the limited time, and the small venue, it was not appropriate to prevent people from speaking, nor could the duration be extended. The narrow assembly hall could not cultivate people's emotions. Therefore, although there were several near-disruptive incidents during the thirty-four days, in the end, everything was completed successfully. Everything that needed to be done was done, and the mission was accomplished. Moreover, we are only in a preliminary experiment. To exaggerate, this achievement has already shown the brilliance of the future of democratic politics, proving that the experiment is a success!</p>

<h3>US Congress Will Conduct Specific Research to Strengthen UN Organs: Amending the Charter to Reduce Veto Power; House Foreign Affairs Committee Invites Austin and Marshall to Testify</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 30th] Reports circulated that President Truman would submit a special message to Congress seeking permission to lease military equipment to the sixteen Western European countries participating in the Marshall Plan. However, White House Secretary Ross has firmly denied this. (See yesterday's newspaper). This denial by the White House has temporarily cast a shadow over discussions within the government regarding strengthening Western European military capabilities. However, according to well-informed sources, two unrelated policies are indeed under consideration, but they have not yet reached the stage of being formally submitted to the White House for consideration or a final decision by the President. One policy stipulates temporary preliminary measures, whereby President Truman would temporarily lease guns, airplanes, and other military equipment to any of the sixteen Western European countries. The other policy is to have Congress pass a bill to strengthen UN organs.</p>
<p>[US Information Service, Washington, 30th] House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Eaton stated today that his group will begin a systematic study of UN organs next Tuesday. At least seven days will be needed to hear opinions from all sides before beginning discussions on the relationship between the Palestine issue and the UN and the United States. Eaton stated that the United States must decide whether to sit idly by while the Soviet Union freezes the UN, or to find ways to amend the Charter. He cited the Soviet Union's use of the veto power as many as twenty-two times to obstruct actions passed by the Security Council by a majority. The first witness to testify on Tuesday will be US Representative to the UN Austin. Secretary of State Marshall may attend on Wednesday.</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 30th] House Foreign Affairs Committee member Monte stated today that the non-communist world possesses 70% to 90% of the critical factors necessary for victory in war. This economic advantage of free countries will be a powerful element for lasting peace. If peace-loving regions around the world jointly utilize their resources in an effective manner of international action, then no belligerent nation or totalitarian aggressor will be willing to embark on communist-style adventures. This so-called effective manner is to amend the UN Charter. A proposal to amend the UN Charter to drastically reduce the veto power of major powers will soon be submitted to Congress. Monte is one of the proposers.</p>
<h3>US Drafting Plan for Military Aid to Western Europe</h3>
<p>[United Press International, Washington, 30th] Senate Foreign Relations Committee Democratic Leader Connally confirmed on the 30th that the US government is drafting a plan for military aid to Western Europe. He stated that the government is expected to submit a bill to Congress next week, requesting authorization for the government to ship arms to Europe. This move will give President Truman the authority to provide tanks, airplanes, firearms, and other military equipment to any of the sixteen Marshall Plan countries to protect America's massive reconstruction investment in the region.</p>
<p>The bill is being drafted by the State Department. It is understood that arms aid to Europe is based on the Military Assistance Act. This clause was originally included in the Marshall Plan by the Senate, but the State Department, fearing that the inclusion of military clauses in economic aid would provide the Communists with a basis for destructive propaganda before the Italian election, requested that the House remove it. Connally also stated that he had discussed this plan with Undersecretary of State Lovett on the 28th, but he could not disclose the details of the conversation. Although this plan has not yet reached fruition, he expects it to be completed soon.</p>
<h3>Stassen Advocates</h3>

Rapid consultation and immediate countermeasures in times of emergency should be included. The veto power should not be exercised. He stated that this plan could be implemented within the UN Charter framework. Stassen did not mention the Soviet Union, only stating that the United States should especially invite the five countries of Britain, France, Belgium, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg to participate.</p>

<p>[United Press, Jerusalem, 1st] The Jewish Haganah forces declared today that the armies of Syria and Lebanon invaded northern Palestine at dawn today, arriving at three Jewish residential areas in the morning and launching a fierce attack. This is the first time that neighboring Arab countries have openly invaded Palestine.</p>
<p>[United Press, Lake Success, 1st] Attempts by UN organs to bring about a ceasefire in Palestine appear to have failed today. The US, French, and Belgian Truce Committee in Jerusalem telegraphed the Security Council, reporting that the general situation in Palestine has rapidly deteriorated, the war is gradually expanding, and normal activities have come to a standstill.</p>
<p>At the same time, Arab Higher Committee Vice Chairman Husseini declared that the Jewish army's offensive in the New City of Jerusalem has completely shattered hopes for a ceasefire in the Old City. However, the UN Trusteeship Council still believes that the ceasefire agreement should take effect in the Old City and hopes to formally issue a ceasefire order to both Jewish and Arab sides today. In addition, telecommunications from various parts of the Middle East indicate that the situation in the Holy Land is serious. The battle for the New City of Jerusalem is being intensified, and the Jewish army currently has the upper hand.</p>
<p>[United Press, Jerusalem, 30th] Jewish strike forces today stormed into southern Jerusalem, appearing to have surrounded several Arab positions. The Arab forces are deploying troops from all over to reinforce the area. Street talk is rife that the battle for the Holy Land is about to begin.

<p>[Agence France-Presse, Lake Success, 30th] The consular corps of the US, France, and Belgium, which are mediating the ceasefire in the Old City of Jerusalem, telegraphed the President of the Security Council today, stating that the Jewish Agency has proposed three ceasefire conditions: (1) Jews must have free access to the Old City (because the Old City is currently controlled by Arabs); (2) Arab armed forces must withdraw from Palestine; (3) Maintain the traffic lines from Jerusalem to all parts of Palestine. After the consular corps submitted these conditions to the Arab side, the Arab side has not yet responded.</p>
<p>[United Press International, Lake Success, 30th] The Arabs of Palestine told the UN Trusteeship Council on the 30th that the conditions proposed by the Jews clearly hinder the plan for a ceasefire in the Holy City.</p>

According to sources close to the meeting, Arab strategists do not favor a blitzkrieg because they lack the tens of thousands of well-trained and well-equipped troops necessary for such a war. Military commanders from Jordan, Iraq, Lebanon, Egypt, and Syria attended the meeting, chaired by King Abdullah of Jordan.</p>
<h3>Soviets Fabricate North Korean Constitution: US Military District Will Not Recognize; Hodge Says No Negotiations with North Korea</h3>
<p>[United Press International, Seoul, 30th] The Soviet puppet government of North Korea, in opposition to the UN plan for Korea, formulated a constitution here on the 30th, claiming jurisdiction over all of Korea, including the US-occupied areas. This Soviet-style constitution designates Seoul, currently occupied by US forces, as its capital. The constitution stipulates that the current capital will be temporarily located in Pyongyang, which is currently the capital of the Soviet-occupied area. This matter was announced by Pyongyang Broadcasting Station, a bubble show amidst the tense atmosphere throughout South Korea at the end of the Labor Day week.</p>
<p>After the Korean Constitution was formulated, the obstacle to Soviet recognition of the new government was removed. After that, the Soviet Union can disclaim responsibility for whatever happens in Korea. US military commander Hodge still insists that the Soviet Union should be responsible for the North Korean government. The constitution also laid the foundation for a possible Soviet withdrawal from North Korea, leaving the United States occupying half of Korea in a Soviet "colony." The constitution was approved by the North Korean People's Committee, which is a communist-controlled provisional government in the Soviet-occupied area. The constitution stipulates the election of a parliament and the appointment of fifteen people as the Presidium, which is the real ruling body. The constitution stipulates that mining, forests, public utilities, and other "important enterprises" shall be nationalized, and formulates a new national flag with a sickle and hammer crossed, naming the new government the "Democratic People's Republic of Korea." When the Pyongyang declaration reached General Hodge, he disclosed a letter he sent to Soviet commander of North Korea, Kolokov, on April 27, stating: "I do not recognize the People's Committee as the government of North Korea, and I do not wish to negotiate with the People's Committee."</p>

<h3>Socony Oil Tanker Imported and Inspected, Two Corpses Buried at Sea, Large Quantity of Opium Discovered</h3>
<p>[Report from This Newspaper] The Socony Oil Company tanker "Charles M. Schwab," which discovered the corpses of two Chinese crew members and a large quantity of smuggled goods on its way to Shanghai, sailed into the Wusongkou yesterday morning during high tide and berthed at the Socony Wharf in Pudong. Customs inspectors, customs police, and port quarantine personnel boarded the ship by speedboat for inspection when it passed through the Wusongkou. Socony Shipping Department Manager Rogers and British Consulate Secretary Holliday also went to investigate. The smuggled goods found on board were four large bags of opium, weighing 153 pounds, worth about more than a hundred gold bars. The bodies of the two Chinese crew members were immediately buried at sea by order of the shipowner in accordance with maritime law, and thrown into the South China Sea. Crew members on board unanimously believed that the huge amount of opium was smuggled by the two deceased Chinese crew members, and that their cause of death was that they entered the tightly closed and unventilated sluice gate to hide the opium, inhaled dirty gas, and died of poisoning.</p>
<p>The "Charles M. Schwab" weighs 14,000 tons and has a draft of more than 30 feet. It departed from the Persian Gulf at the end of March to transport oil eastward, passing through Mumbai in mid-April, and discovered the corpses and opium on the 25th. There are a total of 64 crew members on board, of which only the two deceased were Chinese, named Dai Zongsu and A Xi (both transliterations). The former's position on board was a mechanical fitter, and had been working for a year. The latter was a carpenter, and had only been working for a month. It is understood that they were both hired in Mumbai, India. The place where the two bodies were found was in a box-shaped sluice gate on the right side of the hull between the oil tank and the engine, which was designed for safety. This sluice gate is below the deck, tens of feet deep, with water accumulating inside. The exit is a cylinder that can only accommodate one person, protruding from the deck. It is usually tightly closed with a lid, so the internal air is very foul, and entering it is life-threatening.</p>
<h3>Missing Persons Discovered, Full Ship Search</h3>
<p>According to shipowner Simpson's report on the discovery of the two corpses and the opium, "At 9:00 a.m. on April 25, while the ship was sailing at sea, I received a report that A Xi and Dai Zongsu were missing. Because they were not seen coming to eat breakfast, the cook searched everywhere for them, but could not find them. I immediately gathered all the crew members and ordered them to search separately. Chief Engineer Groom first discovered that the round cover of the box-shaped sluice gate on the right side of the hull had been lifted, and a rope was tightly tied to the coal bunker pipe nearby, with one end hanging into the sluice gate. Upon inspection, carpenter A Xi was hanging at the bottom of the sluice gate, with the rope tied under his armpits, so he was immediately pulled up. However, the corpse was already stiff. Later, Second Engineer Johnson entered the sluice gate with a gas mask and searched, discovering that Dai Zongsu was lying in the water about 18 inches from the bottom of the ship. He was also hoisted up with a pulley, and upon touching him, he was also stiff."</p>
<h3>Both Corpses Showed No Wounds</h3>
<p>Both corpses clearly had been dead for quite some time, and there were no traces of violent acts on their bodies. Further searching in the sluice gate revealed the electric torches they had used. It occurred to me that the reason the two men entered the sluice gate might have been to hide some kind of contraband. Later, a search of their cabin revealed four packages of opium, weighing a total of 153 pounds. I believe the two men entered the sluice gate, filled with stagnant air and sewage gas, in the dead of night between the 24th and 25th to hide contraband, and died of poisoning as a result. The corpses were subsequently buried at sea at 10:45 AM at 12.44 degrees north latitude and 111.34 degrees east longitude. On the 26th, orders were again issued to search the entire ship, but nothing else was found,” it was said.</p>

<h3>Seized Opium to Be Handed Over to Police Bureau</h3>
<p>Customs officers thoroughly searched the entire ship yesterday, but no other discoveries were made. More than one hundred pounds of opium will be handed over to the Narcotics Control Committee of the Police Bureau tomorrow for processing. It is said that this opium is of excellent quality and may have been smuggled on board when the ship passed through Bombay and is local Indian produce. As to whether it was indeed brought on board by the two Chinese crew members and whether there are other secrets to their deaths, since the bodies have already been buried at sea, there is no way to explore the mystery other than through the captain’s report.</p>
<h3>Smuggled Saccharin Seized on Dutch Ship</h3>
<p>Jiang Customs officers recently inspected the crew cabin of the Dutch ship "Binwan" arriving in Shanghai and discovered 133 units of smuggled saccharin and ten pieces of leather in the space under the sleeping berths. The third mate of the ship, Chen Xiali, is suspected of knowing about the smuggling and not reporting it. In addition to handling the smuggled goods according to regulations, the suspected offender, Chen Xiali, has been sent to the Shanghai District Court for interrogation in accordance with the Regulations for the Punishment of Smuggling.</p>

<h3>Mega-Swindler Hu Ruxin Arrested, Victims Numbering Hundreds, Police Bureau Hopes Victims Will Come Forward</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] The Penglai Police Sub-Bureau arrested a "big swindler," Hu Ruxin (24 years old, from Shanghai, residing at No. 14 Xincheng Lane, Xicang Street, Nanshi), near Laoximen yesterday. The victims number in the hundreds, and his whereabouts were extremely mysterious. The Police Bureau had even offered a reward for his arrest. The criminal Hu usually wore a Western suit and leather shoes, appearing to be a high-society figure. He confessed to his swindling activities at the police station yesterday, including: (1) In May of last year, he defrauded Ma Honglin of No. 1 Qing'an Lane, Beijing West Road, of fifteen large and small diamond rings with two bad checks, estimated at over 100 million yuan at the then-market price. Afterwards, Hu fled without a trace, and the victim reported the incident to the Yemiao Police Sub-Station and placed a reward of 10 million yuan for his arrest in the newspaper. (2) Soon after, Hu sold off these items and secretly established the Xianle Singing and Dancing Troupe at No. 222 Linsen Middle Road under an assumed name. He advertised to recruit members, eventually recruiting more than 30 members, all young women. After the fact, he took these women to Hangzhou and other places and forced them to sing for money, with all income split three-seven. To this day, some of the families of these deceived women are still unaware of the details. (3) On March 26th of this year, Hu came to Shanghai and stayed at the home of his friend Zhang Hanmin at No. 33 Wenmiao Road. Seeing that Zhang had an empty house, he secretly advertised to transfer it to Zhu Rongren, obtaining 40 million yuan. He fled the next day. It was not until Zhu officially moved in that he realized he had been swindled and reported the incident to the Penglai Police Sub-Bureau. (4) On the 27th of last month, Hu, again in the name of the Xianle Singing and Dancing Troupe, advertised for staff. Dozens of applicants responded. After collecting a guarantee deposit of 20 million yuan from each person, he disappeared again. As a result, victims such as Hua Yifeng reported the incident to the police station. Currently, the police station hopes that all victims will come to the station to make statements and has applied to the District Procuratorate for detention for further investigation.</p>

<h3>Secret Radio Station Busted, Female Radio Operator on Trial, Claims to Be Unclear About Content of Telegrams, He Rongfu Claims All Reports Were Commercial Information</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] Some time ago, the Garrison Headquarters discovered a "Guangdong Secret Radio Station" at No. 30, Lane 129, Haige Road in this city, which specialized in sending daily Shanghai market information to Guangzhou. When the Garrison Headquarters first discovered it, it thought it was a secret radio station of the Communist bandits. The female radio operator, Wu Lizhen, was arrested on the spot, and according to clues, a branch station was also busted at No. 426 Zhapu Road, and three radio operators, Chen Xiong, Wu Jing, and He Rongfu, were arrested. After investigation by the District Procuratorate, they were prosecuted for the crime of "illegally setting up a radio station."</p>
<p>Yesterday morning, Judge Cao Zushi of the District Court opened the trial. Wu Lizhen testified, "The radio station received telegrams using both clear and encrypted codes. The sending and receiving addresses were replaced by Arabic letters. The Haige Road radio station was "03," and the Zhapu Road radio station was "02." As for the telegrams received every day, I reported them to a Miss Liang at a specified time. As for what the telegrams said, I am not clear. There was a Mr. Li Yimin and another Mr. Zheng in charge of the radio station. We rarely had contact with them. They used the telephone to investigate work and were very secretive, making it impossible to find out."</p>
<p>In the afternoon, the trial continued with He Rongfu, who was in custody. His testimony was roughly the same as Wu's, but He was very familiar with the telegram codes, claiming that the telegrams going back and forth from the radio station were all market information between Shanghai and Guangzhou. As for the whereabouts of the person in charge, he said he did not know. Because the main culprit had not been arrested, the court adjourned the hearing to the 8th.</p>

<h3>Tobacco Merchant Opens Cotton Weaving Factory, Entrusts Wrong People and Is Stolen From</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] Jiang Fachun, from Liyang, was employed by the Czech Tobacco Company in this city. Last winter, Jiang established the Xingye Cotton Weaving Factory at No. 363 Wusong Road and served as the manager himself. He hired Du Zixiong and Yuan Guangquan as staff members, and Wu Qianfeng was the foreman on the factory floor. It officially started operations in January of this year. Later, Jiang was unable to focus his attention because he was losing money in another tobacco business. He entrusted the factory affairs to Du and Yuan for management and did not often go there himself. In early April, Du took two blank pages of Xingye Factory letterhead to Jiang and falsely claimed that debts owed were being handled by him on Jiang's behalf, asking him to sign and seal them.

On the 7th, he went to the factory in person and found that the internal machinery had been moved out, and the workers had been dismissed. He inquired of Du and others, who replied that the debts owed amounted to 2 billion yuan and that the factory had been sold to Zhang Meiji, with 45 million yuan remaining, and asked him to write another receipt so that the money could be collected.

<h3>Jiang Customs Auctions Treasures, Jiang Zhenyu Buys with Huge Sum</h3>

If this amount is calculated according to the listed exchange rate, it is worth 10,637.50 US dollars, or 3,546 pounds sterling. It is understood that Mr. Jiang has a hobby of collecting diamonds. He began collecting various super-grade diamonds in 1935 and has now accumulated a total of 200 carats, of which the three largest weigh 6 carats each.

<h3>Two Hundred Trains Paraded, Labor Circles Celebrate Labor Day, Party and Government Leaders Attend and Deliver Encouraging Speeches</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] Yesterday was May 1st Labor Day, and 800,000 workers in this city had a holiday and celebrated this great holiday. The celebration meeting hosted by the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions was solemnly held at the China Grand Theater on Niuzhuang Road at 9:00 AM. Over 1,000 people attended, including party and government leaders and representatives of various trade unions. In the afternoon, a costume train parade was held with great enthusiasm and good order.</p>
<p>At 7:00 AM, Niuzhuang Road was crowded with traffic. All members of the temporary inspection team organized by the workers were dispatched to assist the police in maintaining order. The members of the meeting presidium Shui Xiangyun, Zhou Xuexiang, Fang Rusheng, Zhang Zhusan, Ye Xianggao, Geng Jiexian, Qiu Changjiang, and Fan Caikui arrived at the meeting before 8:00 AM. Among the guests, Mayor Wu arrived the earliest, followed by Lu Jingshi, Deputy Minister of the Central Ministry of Agriculture and Labor, Fang Zhi, Chairman of the KMT Municipal Party Department, Secretary-General Xie Renzhao, Wu Kaixian, Director of the Social Affairs Bureau, Shen Ding, Director of the Labor Office, Director of the International Labor Bureau's Cheng Branch, British Labor Counselor Hunter, Jones, Representative of the American Christian Church, and Delado, Argentine Labor Counselor, who arrived at the meeting one after another.</p>
<p>Fully Develop National Industry</p>
<p>The meeting began under the chairmanship of Secretary-General Liang Yongzhang. Chairman Shui Xiangyun first delivered a speech, expressing four thoughts: (1) There are two major trends in the world, one is democracy, peace, and freedom, and the other is communist autocracy and tyranny. Workers should make their own choices between these two major ideologies. What we need is stability and peaceful construction. If we do not defeat communism, we will not be able to live and work in peace. (2) In terms of politics: We cannot deny that we are indeed dissatisfied with the status quo to some extent. For example, a small number of corrupt officials and bureaucrats are exploiting the people. We must defeat these corrupt officials. We hope that the new government after the implementation of the constitution will definitely change the perfunctory tactics of the past and move towards the path of reform. (3) In terms of economy: Because our country's production is backward, we need labor-management cooperation to increase production. We must defeat the powerful capital, bureaucratic capital, and profiteers who manipulate hoarding, so that national industries have the opportunity to fully develop. (4) As for the workers themselves: Because workers' lives have indeed improved compared to before after wages are calculated according to the cost of living index, this is the KMT's labor policy. The status of the labor circle in China after the implementation of the constitution is even more important. The principle of people's livelihood in the Three People's Principles must be thoroughly implemented, and the trade union itself should also work hard to learn.</p>
<p>Seek Progress in Stability</p>
<p>Mayor Wu then delivered a speech, stating that workers are the greatest force for stabilizing Shanghai. At present, China should seek progress in stability, not seek reform in destruction. The current wars in China are due to the destruction of the Communist bandits. But today we can say that there is light in sight, which can be divided into three areas: (1) The good and evil of democracy and communism have become increasingly clear. Recently, the Communist bandits attempted to destroy the city's power plants, disregarding the lives of citizens and the production of factories. Their despicable and vicious methods have been known to all citizens. The conspiracy of the Communist bandits has been exposed. (2) Recently, more than 30 Communist bandits have surrendered to the city's security organs. This phenomenon indicates that the beliefs of the Communist bandits themselves have been shaken. (3) The government is determined to reform politics and thoroughly implement democracy. Chairman Fang said in his speech: This Labor Day coincides with the beginning of democracy. The sacred status of labor has been determined, and labor welfare should be further improved and established. Labor education is especially important. The labor circle should unite and not be exploited by the Communist bandits or be divided. Under the leadership of the National Federation of Trade Unions, they should work together for democratic construction.</p>
<p>Divisive Conspiracy Cannot Be Implemented</p>
<p>Deputy Minister Lu said: Our country's workers are progressing year by year, and in the future, we must further organize and exert our strength to make great contributions to the suppression of the rebellion and construction of the country. Director Wu Kaixian said: The establishment of the National Federation of Trade Unions is a glorious page in the history of the entire labor movement in our country. After the victory, the government firmly advocated that wages be calculated according to the cost of living index, ensuring the lives of workers and stabilizing the order of production. Therefore, the divisive and destructive conspiracy of the Communist bandits cannot be implemented. In the future, the labor circle should unite, strengthen the organization, expel conspirators, and withdraw from the labor circle. Subsequently, the representatives of the labor circle, Qu Hanmin, and others, gave return speeches, which won applause from the entire audience. Then, the telegram congratulated Chairman Chiang and General Li Zongren on being elected President and Vice President, telegrams were sent to trade unions in various countries to congratulate them on Labor Day, and there were declarations of the meeting and letters to workers. Finally, Chairman Shui Xiangyun presided over the award ceremony for the labor circle's table tennis league. After the ceremony, the meeting was adjourned with slogans, and the time was 11:30 AM.</p>
<h3>Loud Drums and Shouting Slogans</h3>
<p>The masquerade train parade was originally scheduled to start at 2:00 PM at the Penglai Market in the Nanshi district. However, the weather suddenly changed in the afternoon, with thick clouds gathering. To prevent rain, the parade was started early at 1:40 PM. A total of 209 trucks participated, each with elaborately decorated floats representing airplanes, the earth, wheels, and various industrial products, symbolizing the greatness of labor. Drums were loudly beaten in the trucks, slogans were posted along the way, leaflets were distributed, and slogans were shouted. The parade started from Penglai Road, passing through Laoximen, South Tibet Road, the Great World, Avenue Edward VII, the Garden Bridge, Yangshupu Road, Ward Road, Zhapu Road Bridge, Beijing Road, Jiangxi Road, Nanjing Road, Gordon Road, Robison Road, Caojiadu, Great Western Road, Jing'an Temple Road, Shanzhong Road, Avenue Joffre, and entering Xianqiao before dispersing at the original starting point. Despite the heavy rain, the parade trucks did not stop. However, when passing the Grand Theatre, a truck from the No. 1 Knitting Factory of the China Textile Industries Corporation crashed into the truck in front due to slow braking, injuring one worker. An ambulance was immediately called to take the injured worker to the Sino-American Hospital for treatment.</p>

<h3>Export Exchange Settlement Gradually Decreasing; Relevant Authorities Considering Remedial Measures</h3>
<p>According to sources, the amount of exchange settlement for export goods has been gradually decreasing. In the past, the average monthly exchange settlement was US$13.4 million, but it has sharply decreased last month. According to unofficial estimates, the exchange settlement figure for April is less than US$10 million. There are two reasons for this: (1) The exchange rate is too low, and many exporters are taking risks to smuggle goods; (2) Many exporters are colluding with foreign importers to report lower foreign market prices, thereby evading foreign exchange. If this phenomenon is not prevented, the country will suffer significant losses. A reporter from the United Press has interviewed a leading figure in the export industry to seek opinions on remedial measures. According to him, firstly, the export licensing system should still be implemented to prevent the malpractice of underreporting prices, but this may lead to more severe smuggling. Secondly, an import and export linking system should be implemented, where a portion of the foreign exchange earned from exports is retained to purchase domestically needed materials, import raw materials for export product manufacturing, and import packaging materials. This should also be extended to agricultural products, but it may easily cause fluctuations in the black market. Thirdly, a minimum exchange settlement method for export goods should be adopted, with weekly determinations based on domestic and foreign market prices and posted exchange rates. The standard should be slightly lower than the foreign market prices, so that exporters can obtain a portion of the exchange rate difference. This is a more practical method, and the relevant authorities are currently considering these opinions.</p>
<h3>Rice Prices in Both Northern and Southern Markets Rebound; Flour, Grains, and Edible Oils Follow Suit</h3>
<p>The rice market is firm because the price of household ration rice increased this month, and the quantity has been reduced. In addition, Wuxi has continuously reported price increases. Those holding goods are even more tightly holding onto prices. At the beginning of the market, prices were shouted up by 200,000 to 300,000 yuan, but because the price increase was too high, the local merchants dared not enter the market rashly, and prices soon fell back. In the northern market, Japonica thin rice and Indica rice finally rose by 200,000 yuan, with white Japonica rice reaching 4.15 million yuan from 4 million yuan, and extra-high Japonica rice reaching 4.35 million yuan. In the southern market, early rice rose by 200,000 yuan, then retreated slightly by 100,000 yuan, resulting in a net increase of 100,000 yuan. However, after the market closed, it was heard that the northern market had risen more, so prices were shouted up again by 50,000 yuan. Yesterday's arrivals were 5,452 dan.</p>
<p>Flour</p>
<p>As the market opened in the morning, the holders of goods immediately took the opportunity to try to raise prices, and actual sales also rushed to replenish stocks. Military ship, Lao Che, Red Bee, Jiancheng, and miscellaneous brands of flour were all priced above 1.4 million yuan. Wheat bran followed suit, rising by 25,000 yuan. Wheat remained at 2 million yuan.</p>
<p>Grains</p>
<p>Most grains rose. Soybeans rose by 100,000 to 150,000 yuan, corn rose by 50,000 yuan, red sorghum also rose by 50,000 yuan, mung beans stopped falling and started to rise, rising by more than 100,000 yuan. Raw peanuts from Guangdong were strongly sought after, with goods from Qinhuangdao priced above 8 million yuan, an increase of 550,000 yuan. Selected green skin and sesame seeds from Tianjin were not sought after and fell by 150,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Edible Oil</p>
<p>Edible oils generally rose, with oil factories raising prices. With the increase in the price of household rationed oil, retail investors had strong sentiments, absorbing more than selling, and although some goods were released, sales were very good. Soya bean oil was at 8.78 million yuan, an increase of 280,000 yuan. Jitung raw oil returned to the 10 million yuan mark, closing at 10.05 million yuan, a net increase of 250,000 yuan. Rapeseed oil rose by 250,000 yuan. Small-wheeled sesame oil was not accepted by Guangdong merchants, and the increase was the smallest, only 50,000 yuan. Soybean cakes were absorbed by both retail and Guangdong merchants, adding 30,000 to 40,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>Market Conditions in Various Regions</h3>
<p>Suzhou</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Suzhou by Our Newspaper, 1st] Rice prices in Suzhou rose again today, because the prices in neighboring Wuxi are high, and rice from the surrounding countryside is being diverted there, resulting in a scarcity of supply in the surrounding areas, and those holding goods are taking the opportunity to raise prices.

<h3>Overseas Tung Oil Market Conditions Remain Extremely Weak This Week</h3>
<p>[Reported by Our Newspaper] After the China Trust Bureau raised the purchase price of tung oil to 9.5 million yuan per dan on the 26th of this month, it purchased a total of 550 tons in one week.

<p>[Another News] The China Trust Bureau's Barter Department released a market report on tung oil and bristles this week, stating that the overseas market for tung oil remains extremely weak. The spot price in New York is 23.5 cents per pound, and the contract price is 22.5 cents per pound. However, because the tung oil smuggled from South China is sufficient to meet the needs of the United States, the market has not improved yet.</p>
<p>The overseas market for bristles is still good, but prices are getting higher and higher, and American brush factories are not daring to buy too much. Fortunately, the supply is not large, so it can barely be called stable.</p>

<h3>Listing Issues of Capital Increase Payment Receipts</h3>
<p>— Du Ruixiang</p>
<p>For the organization of a limited liability company, in this time of currency inflation, issuing corporate bonds is not enough to arouse the interest of investors. And borrowing from banks not only requires bearing huge interest expenses, but is also extremely difficult to obtain, so the only option is to increase capital from shareholders to meet needs. Increasing capital and recruiting new shares should be decided by a shareholders' meeting. And after collecting all the new shares, it is still necessary to convene a meeting of new and old shareholders, and even apply for a change of registration, obtain a certificate, and exchange the stocks before listing and trading. The period from the decision to increase capital to listing and trading is at least three months, and at most half a year, which greatly affects the liquidity of the shares. Or even when increasing capital each time, all the old shares issued before are recalled and exchanged for payment receipts. Since it is a receipt and not a stock, it cannot be listed and traded. In the past, the Shanghai Stock Exchange, in view of this actual difficulty, referred to the provisions of the Civil Law on the pre-contract transfer method, and stipulated it in the exchange's business rules, which were approved and implemented. After the deadline at the end of the thirty-sixth year, in January of the thirty-seventh year, the two ministries of finance and economy formulated six handling methods for the expired period of the Measures for Pre-Contract Transfer of Shares of Listed Companies, and the sixth provision stipulated: "From the date of arrival of the document, those who report to the institute for capital increase, or increase capital by re-evaluating the fixed asset value of industrial, mining, and transportation enterprises in accordance with the valuation capital increase method, shall not list the number of shares after the capital increase unless they have applied for a change of registration and exchanged for new shares."</p>
<p>According to the last paragraph of the sixth provision of the above-mentioned measures, "the number of shares after the capital increase shall not be listed," it seems that the listing must be completely suspended during the period of applying for a change of registration because new shares have not been exchanged. However, according to the second paragraph of the fourth provision of the measures, "all shall be temporarily listed according to the original number of shares before the capital increase," it is known that the old shares before the capital increase can be listed and traded. Article 257, paragraph 2 of the Company Law stipulates, "New shares shall not be issued or transferred before registration," which is sufficient to prove that the transfer of new shares cannot be listed and traded on the basis of new shares until after the change of registration has been approved. As for the old shares before the capital increase, there is no provision that they cannot be transferred, and there is no restriction that they must be listed together with the new shares after the capital increase.</p>
<p>Recently, the two ministries of finance and economy have re-formulated supplementary provisions to the above-mentioned sixth provision, and the new shares after the capital increase can be listed and traded in one of the following ways: (1) The original stock is attached with the capital increase payment receipt for trading, (2) The stock is annotated to indicate the capital increase matters, and the original stock is still used for trading, (3) The capital increase payment receipt is annotated to indicate that there is no equity temporarily and the stock is separated for ex-rights trading. Observing the above-mentioned first and second methods, one is to attach the original stock with the capital increase payment receipt for trading, and the other is to annotate the capital increase matters on the original stock and still use the original stock for trading. The trading is actually a mixed trading of old shares and new shares. The third method seems to refer to the fact that the capital increase payment receipt cannot be transferred before registration, nor can it participate in the shareholders' meeting to exercise shareholder rights, but it can be separated from the old shares for ex-rights trading, which is still contrary to the provisions of Article 257, paragraph 2 of the Company Law, "New shares shall not be issued or transferred before registration." And since it is allowed to be listed and traded, but it is restricted from being unable to transfer, unable to participate in shareholders' meetings, and unable to exercise shareholder rights, how can it be said to be fair. And to interpret the words "shareholder rights" literally, it should refer to the abbreviation of shareholder rights. The rights of shareholders to the company are extremely broad. If classified according to the object of the rights, there are individual rights and collective rights. The so-called "temporary absence of shareholder rights," if it refers to the temporary absence of all shareholder rights, then the capital increase payment receipt is equal to waste paper. If it refers to the temporary absence of the right to request a change of name for the stock, and to attend the shareholders' meeting to exercise voting rights, etc., then it is not clearly stated. Moreover, the rights of shareholders to the company are expressly granted by the Company Law, so how can those who hold shares be deprived of their shareholder rights, and those who no longer have shares still have shareholder rights, which is really difficult to understand in terms of emotion and reason. And as for the so-called ex-rights trading, from the observation of the above, it is a trading that removes shareholder rights, which is also very different from the commonly called trading that removes subscription rights and the trading that removes dividend rights. Rather than making such far-fetched regulations, and when necessary, it is difficult for the company to convene a shareholders' meeting, and there are many problems, or even being manipulated, which turns into abuses, it is better to restore the originally established pre-contract transfer method, so that new shares can be listed and traded.</p>

<h3>All-China Games Anecdotes: Xu Heng Rescues Chen Ce Amidst Turbulent Waves</h3>
<p>Xu Heng, a versatile athlete renowned in football, basketball, volleyball, swimming, and all-around sports, has been invited by Admiral Gui of the Navy to serve as the Deputy Director-General and Instructor of the Navy's delegation to the All-China Games. He said, "If the event times don't conflict, I want to play everything."</p>
<p>If time does not permit, he still intends to participate in his favorite sport, swimming. According to last year's tests, his freestyle swimming performance is 27.8 seconds for 50 meters and 65.6 seconds for 100 meters.</p>
<p>He said: "The strongest short-distance swimmers in this Games, as far as I've seen, should be the representatives from Indonesia, Hong Kong, and Guangzhou." Facing strong opponents, he will strive to do his best.</p>
<p>He started his athletic career early, representing the Chinese volleyball team at the Eighth Far Eastern Games at the age of seventeen, playing right forward, and winning the championship. At the Ninth Far Eastern Games, he was again selected as a representative of the Chinese football team, playing goalkeeper, and also won the championship. Both championships were the only championships China won in the two Far Eastern Games, which is quite a coincidence.</p>
<p>After Hong Kong was captured by the Japanese enemy, a few remaining small warships broke out and were shelled by the enemy, sinking. Amidst the turbulent waves, he calmly used his swimming talent to rescue Commander Chen Ce, Hong Kong Acting Governor McDonald, and more than twenty other senior officials. The British government awarded him a medal for this.</p>
<p>Talking about the Navy's strength in ball sports, he believes that the basketball team is stronger. He specifically pointed out several strong players, including Liu Zhengjun, Yu Ruizhang, Liu Jingxing, and Ma Canxi, who have a good chance of reaching the semi-finals at the All-China Games.</p>
<p>He expressed regret for the decline of sports after the war. He felt especially melancholic about the gradual passing of old athletes. He said: "Of the players on the Chinese volleyball team that attended the four Far Eastern Games, only three of us, including myself, Guang, and Li Fushen, are still active in the sports arena."</p>
<p>He is thirty-seven years old, six feet two inches tall, weighs 190 pounds, and is strong and youthful, still like a young man. No wonder he had many romances in the past. He said that he has no hobbies, so youth stays with him. However, he admits that he has fewer opportunities to exercise now, and his body is getting a little fat.</p>
<p>His naval rank is lieutenant commander. He served as the first captain of the Yongning warship. He has temporarily left the military for business, cooperating with Cai Yanxiong in the Siamese timber business.</p>
<p>Cai Yanxiong, a famous basketball point guard and athlete at the last World Games, is known for his high-speed dribbling and defense. He has been renowned in the basketball world for more than ten years, not by chance. This time, he is still the point guard for the Shanghai team.</p>
<p>In his view, the only sign of progress in Shanghai sports in recent years should be basketball. He said: "This is still due to the constant exchanges and observations with foreign teams such as the U.S. Army, Navy, and the Philippines, which have gradually infused new blood into the Shanghai basketball team."</p>
<p>He believes that the Shanghai basketball team is still strong. The only strong enemy in the future will be the Philippines.</p>
<p>Regarding women's basketball, he does not dare to make definitive statements. However, he believes that Shanghai, Indonesia, and Guangdong are evenly matched.</p>
<p>The day before yesterday, more than one hundred overseas Chinese athletes staying at the Yangtze Hotel, accompanied by Liao Liejin, the Director of Overseas Chinese Reception, took four large buses to visit the Guangzhong Textile Factory. Each person received a gift of fabric for a women's cheongsam, which the female athletes used themselves, and the male athletes gave to their wives or lovers.</p>
<p>Liao Liejin said: "There are still several days before the opening ceremony of the Games. He is pondering over how to arrange an entertainment program for the overseas Chinese athletes so that they have something to do both physically and mentally. Visiting Guangzhong is just the beginning."</p>
<p>At 3 PM on the 4th, the Welcome Overseas Chinese Representatives Committee will hold a grand welcome reception at the Lido Garden, presided over by Chairman Huang Yuyi.</p>
<p>Looking at the program, there are already known performances, including Zhang Guoling's violin solo, flag presentations, Chen Lizhen's soprano solo, Xu Mianqing's Nanyang songs, and Liu Meiying's pointe dance. In short, it is guaranteed to be exciting and lively.</p>
<p>The Siamese delegation will fly in from Hong Kong at around 2 PM this afternoon. The characteristic of this team is that enthusiastic people from the cultural and sports circles are responsible for raising funds to participate. This is different from the general delegations initiated and presided over by wealthy merchants and gentlemen.</p>
<p>For example, the Director-General of the Siamese team, Qi Xixiong, is the Chairman of the Siamese Chinese Sports Federation and the Journalists Association, and the General Manager of the Zhongyuan Daily. Zheng Wulou, the Chairman of the Siamese Team Organizing Committee, is the Chairman of the Siamese Relief for the Motherland Famine Relief Association, proving that scholars can also lead troops.</p>
<p>The most noteworthy athlete in the Siamese team is swimmer Hong Sese, who has a time of 3 minutes and 45 seconds in the 200-meter breaststroke, which is close to the national record and should show off her skills at the Games.</p>

Later, the school hired Cui Zongxuan as the Dean of Academic Affairs and rearranged the teaching schedule, which was notified to each professor separately. However, some professors neither notified the school whether they agreed to the rearranged schedule nor came to the school to teach. Under these circumstances, the school had no choice but to hire other professors to come to the school to teach. The teaching situation is now back to normal.</p>

<h3>Cursing</h3>
<p>— Jingwen</p>
<p>Regarding the matter of cursing, it seems that no one has ever researched its origin. According to my presumptuous speculation, cursing probably originated from criticism, or it can be said to be a branch of criticism. Criticism that tends to be sharp and slanderous is close to cursing. The editors of the readers' letters columns of various newspapers now state that they will not publish anything that is personal attacks or exposes private secrets, which means that although criticism is acceptable, cursing is not.</p>
<p>Although cursing may have originated from criticism, the implied meanings of the two are different. The object of criticism is generally based on the matter itself, and even if it occasionally involves personal matters, it probably originates from the event. As for cursing, it is obviously entirely a matter of emotion. When a person starts cursing, it is nothing more than that reason has reached its limit, and they have no choice but to resort to emotion to find relief. However, when Mi Heng in the Romance of the Three Kingdoms cursed Cao Cao, and Zhuge Liang cursed Wang Lang, although it was called cursing, it was actually satire.</p>
<p>Satire is naturally something that belongs to the category of criticism. The difference between it and cursing is that the former is like the stinger of a bee, relatively hidden, and not aimless; as for cursing, it is like the barking of a rabid dog, although the momentum is fierce, it only makes people feel annoyed. Moreover, if you hear it too much, even the intimidating effect will disappear.</p>
<p>Throughout history, both in China and abroad, there have been figures who identify themselves as eccentric scholars and enjoy cursing all living beings. They are dissatisfied with everything and look down on everyone. However, apart from the unrestrained scolding in their writings, they are very likely to put forward reasonable criticisms and concrete proposals. As for the private lives of these people, they are probably more immoral than the people they scold.</p>
<p>This is not to say that the act of cursing is completely unacceptable. Since people cannot help but have feelings of love and hate, venting hateful emotions by cursing heartily may not be a bad method, as long as the cursing is reasonable, appropriate, and makes the person being cursed feel unable to refute it, and makes the person being cursed feel sincerely convinced, then you have understood the "art of cursing."</p>
<p>However, cursing is ultimately not as good as persuading, because cursing is an act that comes from emotion, and it often easily causes a psychological backlash in the person being cursed. It is rare to find real examples of using cursing to achieve a moral effect. For example, the large turtles often seen on walls have existed in Shanghai's alleyway society for who knows how many years, but so far, they have not only failed to achieve the effect of sanctions, but have instead become promotional advertisements. Taking the small to illustrate the large, the mutual scolding between opposing camps in political parties and in the international community has achieved nothing except making national and world affairs even more serious. And it will never have any results.</p>
<p>People, regardless of their intelligence, foolishness, virtue, or lack thereof, probably all have some self-esteem, which is the self-awareness that makes people human. Reason is the foundation of morality in human society. There are too many things in society now that make people feel angry. Not only is cursing not enough, but most of them cannot be resolved with a single curse. The so-called hearts of people have already opened the floodgates, and the words "morality and justice" have become a lone boat in the sea of human desires. "Let them laugh and curse, I will do what I want" has almost become the universal attitude of people today.</p>
<p>In response to this phenomenon, I believe that rather than cursing bitterly, it is better to constantly remind everyone: "We are still human beings," which may be more effective. Because if "he" no longer considers himself a human being, then cursing is superfluous. Writing to this point, I feel that the four characters "Propriety, Justice, Integrity, and Sense of Shame" on top of the International Hotel should perhaps be replaced with the aforementioned four characters "We are Human Beings" in order to suit the needs of the times.</p>
<h3>Lending a Wife</h3>
<p>— Fang Ping</p>
<p>"Lending a wife" is a very common thing among the Eskimo people in the icy and snowy Arctic, just as "lending money" is very common in other ethnic groups. Moreover, their lending of wives is much more generous than our lending of money. There are two reasons for this: First, this is one of the customs to be observed; second, this is a duty to be fulfilled in terms of friendship.</p>
<p>The Eskimos do not ask for any monetary or material rewards for lending their wives, nor do they necessarily seek the woman's consent. According to their customs, the request to borrow a wife should be made directly to her husband, because he has absolute rights to dispose of his wife. Otherwise, there will never be a smooth result.</p>
<p>They take the matter of "lending a wife" so commonly that when distinguished guests fill the ice cellar, the petitioner can casually make his request. Others will not feel surprised, and neither party will feel embarrassed. A request, a reply, others listening, as if discussing a very ordinary transaction.</p>
<p>When night falls and the candles burn out, the man who lends his wife will crawl into his fur sleeping bag alone, and let his wife sleep with another man. Three people sleep in the same ice cellar at the same time, without jealousy or resentment, and without shyness. The whole night is spent in an atmosphere of peace and harmony.</p>
<p>It is said that some white people have also made the same request, and as a result, they were treated with the same courtesy as the locals.</p>
<p>The Eskimos believe that lending their wife not only causes them no loss, but also fulfills their duty to their friends; why not do it! Therefore, they are not at all stingy with lending their wives. But when he understands that you not only want to borrow, but actually want to seize his wife, then he will kill you without mercy, even if you are his close friend for many years.</p>
<h3>"Living Immortal Maiden" Not Unique</h3>
<p>— Nian Ren</p>
<p>A recent report from this newspaper's Chongqing correspondent stated that a "Living Immortal Maiden" named Yang Mei was discovered there, who had not eaten for nine years but lived a normal life, which people found strange. According to this, this matter is indeed rare, but it is not unique. A similar thing has happened in my county. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>My friend Chu, who is a doctor, once told me: In the 20th year of the Republic of China, there was a woman surnamed Tan near Zhuqiao (east of Haining City), who was about 15 or 16 years old. She suffered from typhoid fever, and after recovering, all her physical strength and behavior returned to normal, but she did not want to eat grains. She would vomit as soon as she ate them. She only drank a little boiled water and fruit every day, but she did not ask for it even if she was not given it. Her family was very worried at first, and tried every means to treat her without success. They did not know why. Later, they had no choice but to let nature take its course. There were no other changes. She worked like a normal person, but her palms were as red as cinnabar, and she had a bowel movement every 40 days or so. People thought it was strange, and no one dared to marry her. After 11 years, she suddenly wanted to eat, and then she ate as usual. She is now married and has children.</p>
<p>According to the above, Yang Mei may be able to resume eating one day, which is not certain. I hope someone with good intentions will keep her in their care in order to observe future changes.</p>
<p>Here, I have a fantasy: If scientists can figure out the reason why she can survive without eating, and then figure out a way to achieve this artificially, then there will be a way to treat hunger and a way to abstain from grains. The people will no longer have to worry about rice, and the problem of food will be solved. The world's disputes will then be greatly reduced. This may also be an effective way to achieve lasting world peace.</p>
<h3>Talking About Bees</h3>
<p>— Ruzi</p>
<p>In the animal world, the bee seems to be a "lone warrior" who will "throw a punch" at the slightest provocation, making people afraid to get close to it. Isn't the "sting on the tail of a wasp" something we have long been wary of?</p>
<p>In fact, bees are not that fierce or scary, just a little irritable. Maeterlinck mentioned in "The Anger of Bees" that even the most irritable bees, if you first offer them nectar to appease their starving stomachs, they will lose the courage to be angry.</p>
<p>It is true that the nature of bees is not very docile. Be careful not to anger them! Otherwise, they will never forgive their enemies.</p>
<p>However, a bee loses its own life with a single sting. Therefore, when it gives the enemy the "final blow," its own end has also arrived.</p>
<p>As Maeterlinck said, "For certain people, it has an uncontrollable hatred." Although it loses its life because of a moment of anger, it is ultimately able to hate and dare to hate. Compared with the head-bowing worms that bow and scrape all day long, the little bee is still a respectable little creature!</p>
<h3>Crane Dance Poetry Record</h3>
<p>— Half-Dream Old Man</p>
<p>"Cranes" are not commonly seen in Shanghai. Mr. Huang Yueyuan of Gao'an Road has one in his garden. It is said that it is over a hundred years old and can dance. My old friend Qian Mengfu told me about it. I sent a poem to Mr. Huang, saying: "Everywhere the felt is used, the sheep is laughed at, but it is the training work in the Huang Garden, the three-fold musical mind communicates affectionately, the thousand-year-old jade feathers shine in the cold sky. The strong bones of Leimen are raised on the banks of the river, the fairy posture of Gouling shines on the east sea, only for the lonely and high period to be unparalleled in the world, not to let the beautiful companions be sick in the cage. The clear whistling of the vast sky is heard in Jiugao, the white sleeves and black dress emerge early from the crowd, facing the green peaks to return to accompany me, the boat returns to the Red Cliff to meet you at night, warming up the solitary mountain dream of the fugitive guest, transforming into a cloud of Su Xian, I am ashamed of having no outstanding wings beyond the dust, the old feathers dance in the military atmosphere." Mr. Huang thought it could be adopted and bound into a volume.</p>
<p>A few days later, Mr. Huang asked for a painting on paper, so I painted a picture of a dancing crane and gave it to him. The following year, I went to Huang Garden with Old Man Meng to watch the crane dance. Mr. Huang personally adjusted it, and the crane listened to his commands, dancing in a rhythmic manner, demonstrating that it was well-trained. At that time, the foreign invaders were rampant, and Old Man Meng and I were listening to Master Yingci's lecture on the Diamond Sutra in Tong Garden, so I got the following verses: "There are fierce tigers in front and poisonous snakes behind, with ferocious faces and wolf teeth, struggling to fly but suffering from the cramp, often facing the pliers and nets and sighing. Suddenly, I hear the roar of a lion, and wonderful meanings intertwine like flying heavenly flowers, Old Man Meng has surplus interest in listening to the sutra, and leads me to Huang Garden to tread on the quiet victory. The owner of Huang Garden is elegant and moral, the walls are full of beautiful flowers shining on the path, the splendid jade volume is placed on the table, and artists and talented people all give it away, the old man's vulgar verses are also included, and he is ashamed that the elaborate decoration is not worthy. The host is hospitable and loves cranes, with red tops and frost-colored feathers, the clear cry of Huating cannot be heard, and the immortal ceremony of the red pavilion is not bad; Kailand God stands out in majestic posture, and lingers on the steps, the host beckons and the crane dances, advancing and retreating and circling in a proper manner, sometimes lifting up and sometimes falling down and squatting, sometimes like a dragon leaping or a phoenix squatting, the white and raised neck is speckled with frost and snow, the black and fluttering wings turn the universe. It is a pity that the precious bird is trapped in the rice grains, and the cage is tamed like cattle and sheep, the heavenly hearing of Jiugao is now gone, and the high and proud bones are opened in vain! Why not fly high for thousands of feet and return to the deep mountains and dense forests to your homeland? What is there to take in the confusing world, and what is the benefit of relying on Dou Sheng? Crane, crane, the parting cannot be seen, the host sends off the guest and the crane enters the orchid, the west wind rustles and blows the feathers, the yellow dust fills the road and the white day is remnant. Returning home, I sigh three times for the crane, not allowing me to be sad for the crane, but sad for myself, sitting in the barren road and leaving thorns!" After that, I never visited Huang Garden again, and I don't know if the crane is still alive and well?</p>
<p>Cranes are chosen for their strange and handsome appearance, clear and bright cries, the neck should be thin and long, the feet should be thin and jointed, the body should stand upright, and the back should be straight, which is in line with the wonderful qualities. To keep cranes in a garden, it is necessary to first build a wide platform on a high hill or earth mound for them to make clear cries. A thatched hut is the most suitable for housing cranes, and it should be next to a pond for them to bathe in. Feed them with fish, grains, and fruits. When they are hungry, place food in the open field and have a child clap his hands and stomp his feet to lure them. After they are accustomed to it, they will dance as soon as they hear the clapping of hands. This is the method of teaching cranes to dance. Among the feathered birds, the crane is the most elegant and can be used for leisurely entertainment. Adorning one or two cranes among green pines and green bamboos is a wonderful addition to a painting. In the past, Lin Bu, a hermit on Gushan Mountain, treated cranes as his sons, and the Crane Release Pavilion still stands tall on the West Lake for thousands of years, truly worthy of an elegant person with deep emotions. During the Qing Dynasty, Minister Weng Songchan lost a crane and wrote the two large characters "Visiting Crane" and posted them on the main street. The calligraphy was wonderful and divine, and it was a popular story at the time. Huang Garden also has a parrot, but unfortunately it cannot speak. Parrots are suitable for red windows and green pavilions, but they are not as elegant as cranes. Poets rarely mention them, and that is why.</p>
<h3>Little Raindrops</h3>
<p>— Shi Jimei</p>
<p>People often put the four words "long life without aging" together, but in fact, "not aging" is happiness, and "long life" is hard to say.</p>
<p>The distance between people is magical and elusive. Sometimes, people who see each other day and night are like being far away in the sky; those who are really far away in the sky, even beyond the sky, can sometimes be close at hand.</p>
<h3>Touring Dongting West Mountain</h3>
<p>— Shi Shufan</p>
<p>Together with Sanmu, I and the "Friends' Voice" colleagues arrived at Muzhi. We drank at the Shijia Hotel. The reed buds were just emerging, and the mandarin fish had not yet arrived. I was quite regretful that I would not be able to see the old Osmanthus trees in full bloom, filling the world with fragrance! The hotel is not far from the tower. The sound of the wind from the tower seems to be coming from the tower. The next morning, we set out from the ferry. Passing by the Wu Zixu Temple, fine rain fell on the canopy. The distant mountains were like ink applied to water, and the seventy-two peaks floated and sank with the vast ocean, ethereal and boundless. We climbed Stone Duke Mountain and explored the Twilight Cave. The mulberry trees and paulownia trees lined the road, and various flowers adorned the fences, making it a picturesque scene. We sat in a thatched hall and tasted Biluochun tea, newly cultivated after the Grain Rain, and the aroma filled our noses and tongues. We passed Xiaoxia Bay and Mingyue Slope, all of which were historical sites of the King of Wu. To the southeast is Linwu Cave, also known as Dragon Cave. Next to it is a thatched hut, which is about to collapse after the chaos. Many bamboo rafts are built on the shore of the lake to set nets for fish and shrimp, which is all worth seeing.</p>
<p>Who can understand this desolation? I drunkenly scrawled in a hasty manner. The spirits of ancient and modern times are consumed in decline and chaos, the rouge and powder of Lingyan and the fish of Shijia.</p>
<p>The sound of the river carrying dreams is faint, the wind blowing from the estuary is light, and the raindrops are sparse. Crows gather on the trees, mourning the ancient phases. White waves wet the spring clothes. Without intention to build a fishermen's house, regardless of abundance in the fields, I think of the wild wild peas; unfortunately, the rivers and lakes are separated by reeds and willows, and I always see fire clouds flying deep at night.</p>
<p>The vast official lake is also busy with taxes. The will of heaven and the strength of the people are both weak and unclear. The tea leaves of West Mountain and the oranges of East Mountain make me think of the loquats in May.</p>
<p>The pods are full, and the mulberry trees are dry and clean. Wild flowers charm the guests, each without a name. Sitting in the lake tower watching the world, how many fish and dragons rise unevenly.</p>
<p>The socks in Xiaoxia Bay are covered with dust, and the grass on Mingyue Slope is green again. The dreams of the desolate lords, treacherous ministers, and enchanting women are turned into mountains and rivers for others in the dream. (Editor's note: Mr. Shi is inevitably rude to Xi Shi.)</p>
<p>The ancient cave hides a dragon sleeping soundly. This lake is good in the great Jiangnan. Tea boiling among the pines, what era is it shocking? An old, white-haired monk weeps in the thatched hut.</p>
<p>###</p>
<p>I have heard that not only in the National Assembly in the capital, but also in the election situation in various localities, those who call out "conscience" are seen and heard repeatedly. It is obvious that "conscience" is the urgent demand of the masses, and it is also the justice of ancient and modern times, both in China and abroad. However, those who have always advocated "conscience" have always associated it with "heaven and earth." Except for the evidence on the stage (such as the Magic Lantern and A Blow of Snow), the good words and deeds of the sages, such as Yang Zhen's "Four Knows" in the Han Dynasty, are in this sense. His colleague Wang Mi sent him ten catties of gold, saying, "There is no one who knows at night." Old Mr. Yang said, "Heaven knows! Earth knows! You know! I know! What do you mean by no one knows?" This is another way of saying "There is heaven above, there is earth below, and we have a conscience." "Ten catties of gold" is certainly a considerable value. No matter what the life was like in the Han Dynasty, one catty is sixteen taels, and ten catties is one hundred and sixty taels. Now we should say "sixteen bars." But Mr. Yang Zhen lightly gave Mr. Wang a nail with four "know" words and returned it. It can be seen that although gold is expensive, it always has a market price. Even if it is hundreds of millions of Jinggai, it is still just a "number." As for "conscience," it is a priceless treasure. If it can be firmly maintained, even diamonds and stones of astronomical numbers cannot be exchanged for it! Not to mention gold banknotes?</p>
<p>The ancients talked about "conscience" must be combined with "heaven and earth." Because the "heart" is good or bad, there is no way to believe it, so it must be proved by heaven and earth, that is, the so-called "there are the sun and moon in the light, and there are ghosts and gods in the dark," and the external supervision goes hand in hand. However, in modern times, superstitions are broken, and there is no so-called heaven, earth, ghosts, and gods in the modern era. Relying only on the two words "conscience" is also fragile and vague.</p>
<h3>Strange Sights of Humans and Animals</h3>
<p>— Wu Yong</p>
<p>Hugo: "In the animal kingdom, a pigeon is a pigeon from birth and will never turn into an owl later. This kind of metamorphosis only happens in the human world."</p>
<p>Remarque: "Lions kill antelopes, spiders kill flies, and foxes kill chicks; what else in the world is constantly fighting and killing each other?"</p>
<p>Maeterlinck: "The more truly you see humanity, the more you will like sea lions."</p>
<p>Plac: "There are no barbarians in Africa, and if there are, they are those who came from Europe."</p>
<p>Muns: "You only need to go to the zoo to see how barbaric we humans have become. The ferocious beasts are not in the iron cages, but standing in front of the iron cages."</p>
<h3>In Memory of Mr. Ye Qiuyuan (Part 2)</h3>
<p>— Chu Yukun</p>
<p>In the 26th year of the Anti-Japanese War, Mr. Ye resigned from his position as a reporter for Shen Bao and went from Shanghai to Hong Kong, where he co-edited the English-language "Tianxia Monthly" with Dr. Wu Jingxiong, devoting himself to international publicity. Mr. Ye still did not leave the position of a news reporter. However, he gained more experience in the study of Catholic doctrine. Further attracted by Dr. Wu Jingxiong, he converted to Catholicism in Hong Kong in the 29th year. Strangely enough, Mr. Ye was a anti-religious youth in the past, but later his belief in Catholicism was more sincere than anyone else. While in Hong Kong, he co-edited the Ganlu Series with Dr. Wu Jingxiong, which was published by the Commercial Press. Mr. Ye was in charge of the selection of all the famous works and the recruitment of translators. However, Hong Kong soon fell, and the Commercial Press's Hong Kong branch closed down. It was not until after the victory of the Anti-Japanese War that it was able to be published. Two volumes have been published, one is "Introduction to Philosophy" and the other is "Progress and Religion."</p>
<p>After Hong Kong fell, Mr. Ye went to Chongqing. In addition to serving as a legislator, he also co-edited the "Truth Magazine" with Father Fang Jieren to promote the Holy Church. Soon Mr. Ye was invited by the British Council and the American Catholic Student Mission Society to visit the Catholic professions of various countries in Britain and the United States. In June of the 33rd year, he was granted permission to go abroad by Chairman Chiang, and finally set off on October 10th. During this trip, he passed through India, Australia, the United States, New Zealand, Ireland, and England, examining the Catholic affairs of various countries on the one hand and lobbying to correct international views on the other. When Mr. Ye was in London, Japan surrendered unconditionally. Mr. Ye said that he flew from England to Rome for pilgrimage, and hurriedly returned to China to report on his trip. He wrote a book called "Pilgrimage."</p>
<p>In November of the 34th year, Mr. Ye was in Chongqing and accepted the invitation of Shen Bao to fly to Shanghai with Mr. Chen Xunfu to serve as the chief writer. For the first few months, most of the editorials of Shen Bao were written by Mr. Ye. Mr. Ye was not only talented, but also knowledgeable. He had a considerable understanding of any issue and possessed the necessary qualities of a chief writer. However, he was very humble. I remember once the State Council's Personnel Office investigated the personnel of various newspapers and asked him to fill out a form. One of the columns was: What are your special strengths? He filled in the four words "Nothing Special." On the form, there was also: What are your aspirations? He also wrote the four words "No Aspirations," smiling and showing them to me. Mr. Ye seemed uninterested in politics. In the past seven or eight years, he had never said a word in any meeting he attended in the Legislative Yuan, so his name was rarely seen in the newspapers. In general, people did not know that he was a legislator. Every time he went to Nanjing for a meeting, he signed in and came back. I asked him what news there was in Nanjing, and he always shook his head and replied that there was nothing.</p>
<p>Mr. Ye had no hobbies in his life, but he liked to drink a few glasses of wine. "Mashanghou" often had his traces. He enjoyed drinking alone and found pleasure in it. His family was very happy. His wife was also a Catholic, and her health had always been strong. At the beginning of February this year, he suffered from heart disease, and he thought it was a stomach disease. It was not until he went to Gongji Hospital that he was diagnosed with cardiomegaly. I remember once, Mr. Fang Qiuwei and I went to see him. He had already gotten up and told us happily: "I'm cured, and I'll be discharged from the hospital soon. Thank you for your hard work these past few days!" We talked for a moment and then said goodbye. However, seeing the dark look on his face, it seemed that he still needed long-term recuperation. I never expected that he would not recover after his illness. Mr. Ye passed away at the age of 42, which is really a great loss to Chinese society!</p>
