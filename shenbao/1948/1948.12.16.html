<h3>羅維特副卿發表聲明　美國對華政策不變　亦無召回駐華大使計劃　麥克德謨稱霍夫曼談話係個人意見</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕華盛頓十五日廣播：副國務卿羅維特在記者招待會中鄭重聲明：美國對華政策迄未變更。並謂，蔣夫人之來美，並不影響美國對華政策。羅氏稱：蔣總統領導之中國政府爲美國所承認之政府，美國國會所決定之對華援助，自係指此一政府而言。當時有一記者稱：渠憶及美國所宣布之對華政策中，曾要求中國政府擴大基礎、並包括共產黨。羅氏稱：渠本人所憶者，並不如此。羅氏稱：關於中國組織聯合政府之謠傳，除見諸報載外，並無其他情報。詢以關於中國政府有修改憲法之擬議時，羅氏答稱「並無所聞」。羅氏謂：就渠所知，美政府並無召回美駐華大使商議中國問題之計劃。並謂，司徒大使上月曾考慮回國發表演說，但旋卽打消此議。此後，羅氏並無所聞，關於建議蔣總統移居美國之計劃，目前並無任何迹象。詢以蔣夫人將於何時回國，羅氏答稱「尙無所聞」。</p>
<p>〔美國新聞處華盛頓十四日電〕國務院新聞聯絡官麥克德謨今日說明霍夫曼在討論未來美國政策時，往往僅發表其「個人之意見」。麥克德謨又稱：「本人獲得一種極爲肯定之印象，卽渠（霍夫曼）係僅就一項題目極爲坦白地表示意見，此卽繼續援華問題，尤其是繼續援助，以减輕飢餓與痛苦之問題」。</p>
<p>渠稱：「經合總署之主要目的，乃爲帮助人民。新聞記者提出許多假設性之問題，而霍夫曼先生卽就其個人意見，說明在各種情形下對需要援助者給予救濟之可能性』。</p>
<p>「惟渠明白表示，政治問題在渠官方職權範圍之外，凡在特種局勢發生之時，最後決定，勢須由白宮方面加以擬定」。</p>
<p>「國務院不願多談假設性之局勢或問題，且不將參與推測假設性之可能性。美國政府之對華政策，並無改變」。麥克德謨並謂：「本人並無理由可以相信在南京之吾國人士芷催迫蔣總統成立聯合政府。本人相信，此等消息係屬虛構者」。</p>
<h3>增援大軍開抵蚌北前綫　南下兵團進克魯樓　南綫加強部署戰事仍膠着</h3>
<p>〔本報蚌埠十五日電〕各方注目之十四兵團某軍，昨晚起陸續開來此間，其先頭已抵達曹老集。該軍軍長楊幹才將軍，今晚自　縣來蚌，隨于寓邸接見本報記省。楊氏操其四川口音，以堅强語調對記者稱，渠絕對有把握能打勝仗。據悉：楊氏係十二日由防次抵京，晉謁總統，總統曾笑謂「如你去，你去一定能打得更好！」楊在京留三日，候其部隊北開後，始於十四日由京乘車北上來蚌。又，劉峙總司令十五日晚邀宴楊幹才，並對當前戰局向楊氏分析。又，劉峙十五日曾赴前綫督師。</p>
<p>〔本報蚌埠十五日電〕蚌宿戰塲中，北綫之激戰，正調和南綫之沉悶，在杜聿明指揮下之三個兵團，通日南擊，十五日克復匪重要據點魯樓，並對李樓郭樓形成包圍態勢，在該部國軍陣地北側之匪軍有轉向靑龍集跡象，其企圖顯爲增强阻擊國軍南下之力量。南綫方面，據剿總公報，李兵團昨摧毀包家集南北附近匪之陣地後，今開始向大溝以南地區攻擊。按國軍正加强部署，南綫日來之沉寂，當係在暴風雨來臨之前應有之過渡狀態。</p>
<p>〔本報蚌埠十五日電〕剿總公布：黃維兵團今在雙堆集及其以東地區數度擊退匪之攻勢。按黃兵團被圍苦戰，今爲第二十日。</p>
<p>〔中央社蚌埠十五日電〕我戰車部隊今在空軍密切掩護下配合國軍某部發揮機動戰術，迂繞包家集，攻擊姚莊（在包家集北六公里新集西五公里）經四小時激戰後，將頑匪全部被殲，卽行佔領該地。</p>
<p>〔本報南京十五日電〕據此間可靠方面接蚌埠軍報（一）黃維·李延年兩大兵團，正相對加速掃除障得，力謀接近，可能於十五日夜或十六日晨實現會師。（二）孫元良部隊，現已與剿總取得聯絡，正協同各友軍作有利之策應，戰局穩定，漸露曙光。</p>
<p>〔本報南京十五日電〕匪軍十餘日來膠着於蕭永地區及雙堆集兩處，又這李延年兵團北攻，大有不能再支之勢，十二日竟日陰雨，前綫無飛機出動，正匪軍活躍之時，彼竟終日寂伏壕溝村落不出，可見其疲憊之深。十五日空中搜索，發現濟南兗州等地火車載匪軍二千，向徐州南駛。睢寗東南匪七百名，向固鎭集中，匪似收羅所有剩餘兵力，作最後掙扎。以上流匪，均遭神　朋炸</p>
<p>〔本報南京十五日電〕（一）雙堆集黃維兵團南緣趙莊，十四日失陷後，十五日上午黃兵團派隊奪回，迄下午又陷匪手。（二）空軍爲解黃兵團之圍，十三日十四日利用良好晴空，派出B-24型飛機編隊在雙堆集東西南三面廿里寬範圍之匪佔村莊，投下如雨炸彈，十四日夜間，派出空運機帶炸彈夜襲匪陣。（三）十四日一夜間徐州宿縣間發現匪方汽車五十餘輛，滿載南駛。</p>
<h3>孫科晉謁總統　請示組閣政策及人選</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十五日電〕新任行政院長孫科在滬療疾痊司，十五日晨返抵京，當就組閣之政策及人選兩大重要問題，晉謁總統請示，作最後決定，午十二時在其官邸宴中樞要員有所洽談，孫氏之巨頭內閣有待其重大政策泆定後確定人選，因孫氏所邀要負大多均欲在有主張有政策之情況下，與孫氏共任艱巨。聞孫氏在滬時所邀之要員張羣，張治中兩氏參加之可能性尙大，邵力子則視政策如何為定，如仍爲目前之政策，卽堅不參加。</p>
<p>〔中央社南京十四日電〕孫內閣遲遲未見組成，監委認有加以催促之必要，今晨留京監委四十餘人，舉行之時事座談會中，曾決議請監院咨請總統，從速促成新內閣之產生，座談會係該院副院長劉哲主持。</p>
<p>〔本報蚌埠十五日電〕軍方對蚌南土共顯甚重視，此不僅係因其影響交通之故。按浦蚌間刻有較大之股匪兩部，一爲孫傳嘉部，在鳳陽以南，一爲三三一旅，在滁縣附近。據皖保安司令部情報稱：劉伯承以前曾遣幹部若干，在懷遠以西鳳台以東之淮河灣曲地區，編組十個支隊，所謂三三一旅者，可能卽係該支隊中之一部。</p>
<h3>胡適夫婦抵京</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十五日電〕北大校長胡適及夫人，十五日下午六時三刻自平乘空運大隊專機飛抵首都，同行者有名史學家陳寅恪敎授　家，前平市副市長張伯謹夫婦及北平英文時事日報社長王雲槐等。按總統日前曾遣專機於十四日赴平迎胡氏南來，然以故都局勢陡緊，機塲不能使用，致專機未克降落，乃延至十五日始完成是項使命。胡氏下機後，與蒞臨機塲歡迎之王世杰·朱家驊·蔣經國·傳斯年·杭立武等握手寒暄。據云：平市軍情十五日已趨鬆弛，人心頗爲安定，旋卽偕夫人赴總統府方面預爲準備之寓邸休息，入晚除朱家驊等往訪，談平市敎育界情况外，甚少賓客，且因旅途疲勞，就寢頗早，亦未外出。</p>
<h3>楊森奉召抵京　今日晉謁總統</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十五日電」渝市長兼重慶綏靖公署副主任楊森，奉總統電召，十五日下午六時四十分自渝乘機飛抵京，渝綏署參謀畏范誦堯同機偕來·據楊氏十五日晚語本報記者，渝市治安情形良好，物價亦較低廉，自中央各部會一部分眷屬疏散來渝後，人口增多，渝市現已較前益為熱鬧，每晚均熙熙攘攘。楊氏將於十六日晉謁總統，數日內卽將返任</p>
<h3>平津秩序均如恒　居民鎭定商店照常營業</h3>
<p>〔本報北平十五日電〕今日午前十一時起，平水電若斷若續，迄晚情勢愈嚴重，電車亦因平東雙橋發電廠已失控制，今下午多拋錨街心。</p>
<p>〔中央社北平十五日電〕平郊竄擾戰進行第二日，市面秩序如常，市民至爲鎮靜。王府井·西單·前門大街等繁華區商店照常開業，百貨林列，一如平日，街市除遷住城內之守衛部隊絡繹於途外軍政卡車亦行增多，然習於故都生活之市民安閑心情，並不因此而稍减，慢步街頭，購買雜物如常，隆隆砲聲並未迫使市民驚懼。傅總司令作義，昨夜命令楚主席溪春兼黨政軍督察總監，負責代行糾察執法職權。守衛城郊之九九九部隊，今發出告市民書，說朋守衛城區，効忠國家職志，願與市民共維市內秩序。今日各機關照常辦公，市政府且延長工作一小時。劉市長瑤章告記者稱：爲確保秩序，配合作戰，治安機關首長每日舉行會報，隨時出動戰工人員。至全市食糧烯煤存量，據調查，數月內無問題，又爲健全軍事供應，平市軍民合作委會已於昨日改組成立。</p>
<p>〔本報天津十五日電〕津防務鞏固，國軍已加强部署城郊工事，作必要戒備，市內商業繁榮如恒。津塘治安良好，塘沽情勢穩定，北塘亦尙在國軍手中，津東行車十五日通新河。</p>

<h3>金圓劵存款兌現辦法　以前各地頒行辦法一律失效</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十五日電〕金圓券存款兌現辦法，十五日經政院通過後，卽日起公布施行，所有以前各地頒行之各種存兌辦法，一律失效。十五日晨京各銀行仍按舊辦法收存兌現，中午政務會議通過新辦法後，財長徐堪當卽電告央行，轉知中·交·農三行暫停收兌。十五日下午各行同時停止辦埋，根據央行十三日頒布實行之軍警公敎員工存兌辦法，由各機關彙請央行辦理手續，十四日起原已實行，各機關員工正爲其被允許存兌五兩黃金之籌款者奔走，現亦同時失效，至依照十五日通過之新辦法辦理存兌，央行已定十七日開始，俾於十六日完成各種準備。</p>
<p>〔中央社本市訊〕頃自中央銀行獲悉，關於金圓券存款兌現辦法，業經行政院政務會議通過，全文如下：</p>
<p>第一條　凡依照修正金圓券發行辦法第十一條之規定，以金圓券存款兌現者，應依照本辦法辦理。</p>
<p>第二條　經辦存款兌現之銀行，爲中央銀行或其指定之銀行，以下簡稱承辦行。</p>
<p>前項指定之承辦行，由當地中央銀行先期公吿之。</p>
<p>第三條　爲使一般民衆獲得平均儲蓄之機會，幷防止大戶套購圖利起見，存兌黃金，暫依左列規定：</p>
<p>（一）存款兌現人，須爲成年者，三個月存兌一次。</p>
<p>（二）每次存兌數額，以黃金一市兩爲限。</p>
<p>第四條　爲便於計算授受起見，黃金單位重量分爲五錢及一兩兩種，其存兌款額不足五錢者，按規定比率折合銀幣兌給之。</p>
<p>第五條　凡存款兌現人，應向當地承辦行索取申請書，依式塡寫，簽名蓋章，復迎同本人身份證，交付承辦行登記。前項申請書由銀行印製，其格式另附。</p>
<p>第六條　承辦行接到申請書及身份證，查對申請人確爲成年人後，應依次登記編定號數，以申請書第一聯及身份證交還原申請人，第二聯存行備查。</p>
<p>第七條　承辦行應依登記次序排定每日存兌號數，在當地日報先期公吿之。</p>
<p>前項公告，應於登記後三日內爲之。</p>
<p>第八條　申請人應於日報公告指定之日，持同已登記之申請書及本人身份證，親向原承辦行繳款，換取存單及黃金或銀幣，其身份證於核對後發還之。</p>
<p>申請人不於公告指定之日期前往存兌者，註銷其登記。</p>
<p>第九條　承辦行查核申請書與登記相符，驗對身份證照片確爲申請人本人後，按其存兌數額，核收現款，隨卽在身份證上加蓋某月份金銀兌訖戳記，連同存單及黃金或銀幣，一併交還原申請人，其申請書第一聯收回存查。</p>
<p>第十條　爲便利軍警公敎員工起見，承辦行應於星期日辦公，專爲軍警員工辦理存兌事，其經辦人員得於星期三休息一天，軍警公敎員工之申請書上，應加蓋本機關印信。</p>
<p>第十一條　承辦行應將各存兌戶名及每戶兌出數額，在當地日報每旬公布一次。</p>
<p>第十二條　本辦法自公布日施行。</p>
<p>〔中央社南京十五日電〕十五日政務會議通過金圓券存款兌現辦法後，財長徐堪特發表談話，略稱：政府此次公布本辦法，其最大的意義，是澈底實行存兌政策，使其利益及於大多數的人民，並使少數的奸徒豪富不能再逞操縱壟斷的技倆，凡百政策，在施行過程中，難免不發生漏洞，貴在能隨時注意改善補救，以求完美，尤其是在金融措施方面，其情節更爲錯綜複雜，當然需要隨時改善，以便達成原政策的眞實的效果，本人很希望各界仍繼續多予指敎，只要有助於國家的政策，有裨於大多數人民的利益，本人絕對歡迎採行。</p>

<p>淮河流城的戰事現在還是膠着，華北的平津北段激戰又起，自戡亂軍事發動以來，國家民族的命運，嚴重當莫過於此時。然而，一看中樞的政局，翁內閣辭而不辭（名義已辭而實際在幹），孫院長就而不就（名義已發表而實則還未就職組閣），　瘓疲　的現象，竟在戰局萬分嚴重的今日見之於中央政府，此誠古今中外至奇之事。甚至兵連禍結，赤地千里，大仗已經打了經年，軍民為爭自由而犧牲的生命幾已不計其數，而連日莫名其妙的政治謠言還在散播，二三政客夾雜了若干這聽塗說的記者，一若必欲先爲共匪自効其政治攻勢之勞，瓦解我們前綫旺盛的士氣以爲快；美國政府發言人昨天已在闢「聯合政府」之謠，而吾中樞當局，反依然熟視無覩，充耳不聞，此眞奇之尤奇的事了！</p>
<p>第一，我們要提醒若干幻想和平好夢的人：照常理論，誰不渴望和平？但和平不是苟安，和平尤須與自由相結台；否則和平無異奴役。且惟能戰而後能守，亦惟能守而後能和。今日大局，中樞縱不能遽言進攻，至少要當能戰能守，方有和的資格，否則不是和而是降！但旣能戰能守，則又何必與中共的匪軍言和？何况今日與國民政府相抗爭者爲中共，他們所信仰者爲共產主義，他們所率行者爲第三國際之命令，他們所憑藉之武器得於蘇聯之手，他們所組織之部隊雜有日共韓共蒙共之國際成員，他們所欲宰制而剝奪者又爲吾人民切身利害所關之自由生活，以堂堂國民所託命之政府，安有與叛國殃民之匪徒言和之理？吾東北部隊，濟南部隊，前此已因少數不肖將領誤於所謂「聯合政府」之和謠而令部隊放下武器，遂釀成今日垂危之局，假使今當徐淮士氣極旺之秋，正在紮硬寨打死仗之際，而又任令動搖國本之和謠隨地播弄，是直不啻甘作共匪宣傳戰的先鋒隊了。廟堂之上如無秦檜，則疆塲之上自有岳飛！和謠如果再盛，行見前綫所受的惡果或有不忍想像的一天。故中樞果有堅決作戰的意旨，首當以行動事實來闢無稽的　言，則賣空買空的官僚政客自可無所施其技。</p>
<p>第二，自古中國用兵，北方則河北與關中並重，南方則淮防較江防爲先。目前淮上之戰已歷月餘，雙方都用全力，請先言蚌宿會戰之重要。昔人曾謂南得淮則足以拒北，北得淮則南不能自保，今雖交通略有變易，海軍空軍更足增固長江天塹之防，而形勝大要古今仍不相遠。東晉元帝渡江，一直到陳，南朝抗對北虜者凡五代；楊行密割據，迄於李氏，不賓中國者凡三姓，均以得淮南之故。吳不得淮南，故吳卒并於晉，陳不得淮南，故陳終并於隋。可見誠欲固江，必先固淮；無淮防，則江防亦危。劉季裝曾謂：「自古守淮，莫難於謝玄，又莫難於楊行密。謝玄以八千人當苻堅九十萬之衆，淸口之役，楊行密以三萬人當朱全忠八州之師，衆寡殊絕而卒以勝者，扼淮以拒敵，而不縱敵以入淮故也。」今天蘇北皖北的戰事，正膠着於當年淝水之戰的地帶，也正是爭兩淮的大決戰。吾最高統帥所以一再調兵遣將以增援者在此。中樞大員，前方將士，與後方人民，應該認淸現實，十分重視這個南戰塲的大決戰，發動全力，來爭此決戰之勝利。這一決戰的勝敗關係太大了！勝利不在乎零星的多，而在乎此淮上決戰的勝利；但勝利決不是一些沒有信心的人們所能爭取的。中樞必須肅淸失敗主義的份子，才可以得最後的勝利。</p>
<p>第三，講到華北平津戰塲的激戰，我們應該充分信任傳作義將軍，早應加强其實力，支援其戰略，而尤要者必須鼓勵其士卒，堅守此河北的名城。中國古來在北方爭天下者，不是用關中，就是用河北，而三晉河洛則爲其孔道。呂東萊嘗謂：「用關中并天下者五而不得者三，用河北并天下者一而不能者三』，又謂周秦漢用關中，漢光武用河北，惟曹操石勒以河北取關中，苻堅以關中取河北，三人皆吞海內十有八九而終不能統一。這些論斷固不盡符於今日域中的情勢，然而共匪欲圖控制全國，在北必爭河北，也必爭關中。先後容有不同，而遲早必爭者一。關中戰事，宜有準備備，茲姑勿論。惟河洛旣入彼手，三晉祗餘太原，則今日北方形勢，自當劍及履及，爭此平津之一戰，以奠定河北之大局。林彪匪部傾巢入關，受迫於李立三而不能退，形同背水，志在必取·然而傳將軍以逸待勞，形勢遠勝。設吾上下一致，文武協力，則以傳將軍百戰之師，善守聞名，華北人民之傾心崇信，心理堅固，而又濟之以縮短防綫主動戰略之實施，敢信當可使入關之林匪，在平津之郊，受此名將之一搫。</p>
<p>總之，今天大局已因往日政治之失，策略之誤，官吏之貪汚領預，而演變至於如此，已令愛國人士欲哭無淚，若吾中樞於此時猶不戢其謠風，人民尙不奮其自力，祇知臨難競求苟免，爭利唯恐不先，甚至紓難勿必毀家而竟不肯拔其一毛，則吾恐「議論未定，金兵渡河』，至慘至痛的局面亦未必不隨共匪「第五縱隊」之蹤跡而俱至！噬臍之悔，萬無及矣。</p>
<p>關係國家民族生死存亡的南北大會戰，已同時展開，而中持吾中樞政局的閣僚，還在若有若無的狀態中酣然做夢，咄咄怪事，無過於此！</p>

<h3>美衆院議長馬丁公布　我監察院請援電文　立院電文亦交國會委會考慮</h3>
<p>〔中央社舊金山十四日電〕我監察院向美國國會呼籲增加對華援助，以克服共產主義所招致之「火急危機」，並保障民主生活方式之函電，已由衆院議長馬丁於今日公開。該電係由我駐美大使顧維鈞，於本月十一日交與馬丁及參院議長范登堡。馬丁公布該電時，朱作任何評論。聞立法院亦有類似電文於十二月第一週內，轉致馬丁與范登堡二氏。若干觀察認爲該電乃以直接向國會呼籲之方式，而不通過白宮與國務院，電文內有云：「如中國不幸遭克服，則遠東勢將赤化，亞歜二洲亦不得倖免，卽美國亦難保安全」。我駐美大使館發言人稱，我監察院致電美國國會，乃一國之民選團體，致電另一國民選團體，無所謂不通過美國政府之行政部門。大使館並稱，將監院電交參衆兩院，僅係答允監院特別要求，故此次轉函之「通常業務」，並無「特別意義」。監院電文內并有謂，國際共產主義，現正襲德日之故技，進攻愛好和平與民主之國家，而中國之共產叛亂非徒內戰而已，實係對民主國家之生活方式及世界和平所發動之侵略。并謂，中國在抗日戰爭中，遭受嚴重破壞，現復被迫對共產主義發動偉大之十字軍，如必須單獨作戰，則無操勝算之把握，馬丁承認已接得我立監兩院之通電，渠稱，兩電業已分別轉交國會各委員會考慮，迄目前爲止，立委呼籲電尙未公布。</p>
<h3>美共和黨議員　呼籲有效援華</h3>
<p>米羅着手草擬計劃</p>
<p>〔聯合社紐吉賽州開姆登十四日電〕共和黨衆院外委會委員周以德稱，美國已使中國受創傷，莫如立卽援華爲補救，俾免失之太晚。中國倘無美國援助，將陷於蘇聯控制下，最後吾人仍須在華制止蘇聯，則何不趁早爲之。目前中國之對共戰事，乃世界一切問題之關鍵，除非吾人迅速給予中國物資，吾國在華之投資將耗竭，馬歇爾計劃亦決不能實現。</p>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓十四日電〕共和黨衆院外委會委員米羅稱：「美國應立刻並切實援華，以防亞洲淪於共產。余已着手草擬援華計劃，準備於明年新國會開幕日提出，其中規定立卽以十億元援華，派遣大規模軍事顧問團赴華指導政府軍作戰，並蒐集陸海交通設備，以運輸必需軍用品。余望此項計劃能及時通過，以援助蔣總統」。</p>
<p>〔中央社紐約十四日電〕美共和黨議員普魯斯特，今日於廣播中討論中國危機，呼籲美國予將總統政府以有效之援助。美國之政策，應爲竭力支持蔣總統政府，因蔣氏乃挽救中國不受共黨荼毒之一種希望。</p>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓十四日電〕美國前第八軍軍長艾契堡將於本年底退休軍職，渠稱，日本於各佔領　國軍隊撤退後，如屈服於共黨，渠「對後果將不勝驚佈」。問以渠對中國情勢有何意見，艾氏答稱：「國民政府如失敗，而中國告赤化，則第二次世界大戰中太平洋上之勝利已非勝利」。</p>
<h3>美報要求發表　對華政策聲明</h3>
<p>〔中央社紐約十五日電〕紐約時報本日於社論中要求美政府當局發表關於對華政策之明確而且權威性之聲明，紐約時報謂，美國納稅人有權獲悉整個眞象，蓋中國目前之局勢，對每個美國人民均爲重要。</p>
<p>〔合衆社紐約十五日電」霍華德系報紙十五日社論稱：經合總署署長霍夫曼在上海之談話，對中國政府不啻爲一種嚴重打擊，「吾人對霍氏於此時此地發表如此聲朋，不得不加指斥，此項政策與反抗赤色侵略之杜魯門主義，實相悖逆」。「蘇聯藉中共軍隊深入東北及華北，已使吾人在朝鮮及日本之軍事地位孤立，美國在遠東之戰略利益早已大受威脅，如華府方面鼓勵在華北建立聯合政府，則可能華南及東南亞亦將步其後塵」。「吾人從事太平洋戰爭之目的，是否在以蘇聯代替以前之日本？吾人對杜魯門總統繼續其目前之對華政策，幾不可想像，如總統堅持如此，吾人相信國會將予以阻止」。</p>

<h3>日財相失態事件發生後　麥帥支持吉田內閣　國會即解散民自黨大選中仍佔上風　新預算案深宵可望通過</h3>
<p>〔新亞社東京十五日電〕日衆院預算委員會今日上午十一時舉行會議之結果，決定仍照政府所提之預算案審查，蓋因要帥總部民政局長霍德尼氏曾告衆院議長松岡稱：「在野黨所提之預算修正案，（卽根據臨時人事委員會所定新薪給標準，所擬定之預算案）因政府財源關係，不能適用」。今後薪始標準仍將照政府大藏省所定之五千三百二十八元之某數，新薪給之實行日期，將自十二月一日開始，並不得追補以前之薪給。衆信麥帥總部之此項指示，係出於昨晨吉田與總部方面商談之結果，因此一般預料在泉山事件發生後，雖有議員要求吉田內閣總辭職之意，但在麥帥總部之暗示中，已有支持吉田內閣維持殘局之意，故決不致總辭職，卽令國會解散，民自黨自仍將處於有利之競選地位也。</p>
<p>〔合衆社東京十五日電〕吉田內閣之少教黨及其他反對黨，十五日下午仍繼續爲公務員之新基薪爭辯不休，但預算案可望于深晚通過，嗣後卽可望通過對吉田政府之不信任案。吉田可望于十七日在上院通過預算後解散衆院，一般揣測，普選新衆院將在明年一月中旬舉行。</p>
<p>〔新亞社東京十五日電〕大屋相十四日被命兼任藏相後，首次對記者發表談話稱：「迄十三日夜爲止，預算問題進行極爲順利，不幸因泉山失態形勢起變化，政府與野黨之關係轉趨惡劣，惟今日起可望好轉」。</p>
<p>〔聯合社東京十五日電〕日本議會今日開會時，反對派議員數人要求吉田內閣立卽辭職，理由爲財長泉山調戲女議員，內閣體面已盡失。</p>
<h3>印尼要求安理會即開會　討論荷印間局勢　阻止事態惡化並設法恢復談判</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕巴黎十五日廣播：印尼共和國要求安理會立卽開會，討論印尼與荷蘭軍隊之緊張局勢。印尼駐聯合國代表促請安理會主席注意星期二聯合國斡旋委員會提出之報告。該報告謂目前之局勢可能使戰事擴大。渠要求安理會尋求若干方法以免局勢惡化，同時設法恢復印荷談判。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社海牙十五日電〕荷蘭內閣關於印尼之未來問題，舉行極關重要之閣議。據消息靈通方面稱，荷內閣決定對印尼共和國採取「警察行動」，惟何日開始則尙未確定。同一方面力稱：荷內閣此項決定，並不因印尼共和國總理哈泰十四日所宣佈之聲明謂，印尼願在過渡時期內尊重荷蘭之主權而可能有所改變。此間消消靈通方面認爲哈泰顯然表示妥協態度，但此種態度渠之內閣同僚以及印尼軍事領袖並不贊同。渠等又認爲，印尼武裝部隊之潛入西爪哇，更使荷蘭隨時有採取軍事行動之理由。據同一方面意見，荷蘭在印尼臨時聯邦政府成立之前，卽有採取行動可能，以避免印尼境內非共和國之自主邦參加印尼共和國之內，與印尼駢肩對荷籣作職。</p>
<p>〔聯合社海牙十四日電〕荷籣內閣今日整日舉行緊急會議，討論印尼共和國總理哈泰所提新照會，照會內容未宣布，但據可靠消息，印尼願意在過渡時期承認荷蘭對印尼之主權。荷政府原擬設立印尼聯邦臨時政府，不待印尼共和國參加，現已暫緩實施。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社華盛頓十四日電〕印尼共和國駐華盛頓代表索米特羅博士今日發言謂，安理會不日將設法恢復印尼與荷蘭之談判，以覓取和平之解決。並稱：此種希望乃根據可靠方面之消息，此項談判將由斡旋委員會主持復行開始，如印尼之戰事復作，則最可得利者厥爲共產份子，當知印尼事變之影饗將及於亞洲全部</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社海牙十四日電〕經濟合作總署駐荷蘭代表海特，今日否認外傳荷籣曾用美款購買武器與軍事配備，以供印尼荷軍之用之說。</p>
<h3>日本與暹羅　簽訂貿易協定</h3>

<h3>美前第八軍軍長艾契堡　主張配備日新軍　人數十五萬作為國際防共隊伍</h3>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓十四日電〕美國前第八軍軍長艾契堡中將，十四日接見合衆社記者時，指出有建立配備精良之日人警衛隊之「極端重要性」。渠稱，可能之方法有下列兩種：（一）武裝現有全部警察十二萬五千人，並將數額增至十五萬人，（二）將現有警察維持原狀，建立全新之保安隊，人數多至十五萬人。</p>
<p>艾氏稱，渠贊成第二種方法，並謂由第二種方法成立之部隊將爲祖任國際性防務之國家保安隊。渠稱，此項部隊之最高數額，應限爲十五萬人，並應祇有小武器之配備。「如配備不精，彼等將毫無用處。」艾氏復謂，當渠離日之時，全部警察十二萬五千人僅有一萬八千支手槍。在討論有組織日人武裝保安隊之必要時，艾契堡稱：「當亞洲大陸上共黨大舉南下之際，此舉對日本更屬軍要。」渠繼稱：「當盟國並無共黨之助——余鄭重聲明，並無共黨之助，而擊敗日本之後，吾人曾消除阻止共黨南下之障礙物。消除障礙之結果，其重要更甚於吾人在雅爾達會議或波茨坦會議中對蘇聯之任何讓步。當吾人擊敗日本後，吾人已消滅亞洲之均勢。」艾契堡雖未明言所消除者爲何種障礙，其意顯謂佔據東北之日本關東軍。</p>

<p>葛氏又稱，陸戰隊之擇本週來滬，並無特殊意義。「貝爾福」號將泊於某美海軍使用地，俾陸戰隊有機會假左近戰地操演娛樂。葛氏討論國務院政策不變時稱：「國務院仍希望非必要之美僑能先行撤離，俾因職務不得不留此者能妥獲保護。今日所談之計劃，與西太平洋司令白吉爾中將前日所宣佈者一致。美僑之去留悉在自擇。吾人當然無權迫彼等離滬，或拖曳彼等出境，吾人應了解每一種可能性，然吾人不擬規定何種僑民爲必要者抑非必要者，此事當由彼等就事實自行決定。」</p>
<p>克勞福少將並鄭重聲明稱：陸戰隊之來滬，僅係偶然，並非即謂今日局勢已趨惡劣云。</p>
<p>〔又訊〕今日到滬之美艦貝爾福號將泊駐楊樹浦碼頭。</p>

<h3>米業代表解釋以布易米之謎　存於中紡倉庫布疋　遲遲未提自有原因</h3>
<p>米業以布易米案揭露後，各方咸極注意，尤以布疋尙存倉庫，何來易米一點，認爲頗有疑問。茲據米商業公會負實人談稱：經管當局爲謀抑平米價，決定以布易米辦法，在該項辦法實施之初，蔣督導員曾於十月四日在央行召集米業代表洽商，吳市長及糧食部緊急儲購會主委楊綽庵亦在塲，當時面囑儘量設法赴各產米區搜購食米運滬，照限價每祖二十二元供應，但各地米價已漲至三十餘元一担，其虧損部份，由當局照限價配給布疋二萬疋，轉運外埠售出，以資彌補，至十月二十三日，本會始勉强籌款五十六萬教千金圓，一面繳款購布，一面陸續購米三萬另六百餘石銷售，二萬布疋則始終存於中紡倉庫，未曾提出，因有糧貸案前車可鑒，故當時爲鄭重起見，特先由各米行米店，將採購食米運銷脹目結淸呈報，再經會計師三人詳細審核，認爲正確後，再擬照規定比例，提取布疋撥發，故布疋始終未動分毫云。</p>

<h3>Statement by Undersecretary Lovett: U.S. Policy Towards China Unchanged; No Plans to Recall Ambassador to China; McDermott Says Hoffman's Remarks Are Personal Opinions</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Washington, 15th - A radio broadcast reported that Undersecretary of State Lovett solemnly declared at a press conference that the U.S. policy towards China remains unchanged. He also stated that Madame Chiang's visit to the United States would not affect U.S. policy towards China. Lovett stated that the U.S. recognizes the Chinese government led by President Chiang Kai-shek as the legitimate government, and the U.S. Congress's decision to provide aid to China refers to this government. A reporter then mentioned that he recalled the U.S. announced policy towards China had requested the Chinese government to broaden its base and include the Communist Party. Lovett stated that he did not recall it that way. Lovett stated that rumors about the formation of a coalition government in China were only found in the newspapers and there was no other information. When asked about the proposed amendments to the Chinese constitution, Lovett replied, "I have not heard of it." Lovett stated that to his knowledge, the U.S. government had no plans to recall the U.S. Ambassador to China to discuss the China issue. He also stated that Ambassador Stuart had considered returning home to deliver a speech last month, but he quickly dismissed the idea. Since then, Lovett had not heard anything about a proposal to suggest President Chiang Kai-shek relocate to the United States, and there were no signs of it at the moment. When asked when Madame Chiang would return home, Lovett replied, "I have not heard."</p>
<p>[United States Information Service, Washington, 14th Dispatch] State Department press liaison officer McDermott stated today that when Hoffman discusses future U.S. policy, he often only expresses his "personal opinions." McDermott also stated: "I have a very strong impression that he (Hoffman) is only frankly expressing his opinion on one topic, which is the continued aid to China, especially the continuation of aid to alleviate hunger and suffering."</p>
<p>He said: "The main purpose of the Economic Cooperation Administration is to help people. Journalists raised many hypothetical questions, and Mr. Hoffman expressed his personal opinion on the possibility of providing relief to those in need under various circumstances."</p>
<p>"However, he made it clear that political issues are beyond his official authority, and the final decision in special situations must be made by the White House."</p>
<p>"The State Department is unwilling to discuss hypothetical situations or questions, and will not engage in speculating on hypothetical possibilities. The U.S. government's policy towards China has not changed." McDermott also said: "I have no reason to believe that our people in Nanjing are urging President Chiang Kai-shek to form a coalition government. I believe that this news is fabricated."</p>

<h3>Sun Ke Visits the President to Ask About Cabinet Formation Policies and Personnel</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Dispatch from Nanjing, 15th] The new Premier of the Executive Yuan, Sun Ke, returned to Nanjing on the morning of the 15th after recovering from his illness in Shanghai. He immediately visited the President to ask for instructions on the two major issues of cabinet formation policy and personnel, making a final decision. At 12 noon, he hosted a banquet at his official residence for key central figures to discuss matters. Sun's heavyweight cabinet is waiting for its major policies to be finalized before determining the personnel, because most of the key figures invited by Sun want to take on difficult tasks with Sun when there are propositions and policies. It is heard that the possibility of Zhang Qun and Zhang Zhizhong, two key figures invited by Sun in Shanghai, participating is still high. Shao Lizi will decide based on the policies. If it is still the current policy, he will firmly refuse to participate.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency Dispatch from Nanjing, 14th] The Sun Cabinet has been slow to form. The supervisors believe that it is necessary to urge it. This morning, more than 40 supervisors stationed in Nanjing held a current affairs forum, in which they decided to ask the Supervisory Yuan to consult the President to expedite the creation of a new cabinet. The forum was presided over by Liu Zhe, Vice President of the Supervisory Yuan.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Dispatch from Bengbu, 15th] The military attaches great importance to the local communist troops in southern Bengbu, not only because of their impact on transportation. According to reports, there are two larger groups of bandits between Pu and Bengbu, one is Sun Chuanjia's unit, south of Fengyang, and the other is the 331st Brigade, near Chuxian. According to intelligence from the Anhui Security Command, Liu Bocheng had previously sent some cadres to the Huaihe Bay area west of Huaiyuan and east of Fengtai to organize ten detachments. The so-called 331st Brigade may be one of these detachments.</p>

The original implementation started on the 14th. The staff of the various agencies were running around to raise funds for the five taels of gold that they were allowed to deposit and cash, and now it is also invalid. The Central Bank has set the 17th as the start date for handling deposits and cashing in accordance with the new measures passed on the 15th, in order to complete various preparations on the 16th.</p>

<p>Article 5: All depositors and cashers shall obtain an application form from the local Handling Bank, fill it out in the prescribed format, sign and seal it, and return it to the Handling Bank for registration together with their ID card.

<p>[Central News Agency Dispatch from Nanjing, 15th] After the Executive Yuan's Political Affairs Conference passed the measures for cashing Gold Certificates deposits on the 15th, Minister of Finance Xu Kan issued a statement, stating briefly that the greatest significance of the government's promulgation of these measures this time is to thoroughly implement the deposit and cashing policy, so that its benefits will reach the majority of the people, and so that a few traitors and wealthy people can no longer use the tactics of manipulation and monopoly. In the process of implementing all policies, loopholes are inevitable, and it is important to pay attention to improving and remedying them at any time in order to achieve perfection, especially in financial measures, the circumstances are more complicated, and of course, they need to be improved at any time in order to achieve the true effect of the original policy. I hope that all sectors will continue to provide more guidance. As long as it is helpful to the country's policies and beneficial to the interests of the majority of the people, I will absolutely welcome its adoption.</p>

<h3>Editorial: The North-South Battlefields and Political Rumors</h3>
<p>The battles in the Huai River region are currently deadlocked, and fierce fighting has reignited in the Tianjin-Beijing section of North China. Since the launch of the anti-rebellion military campaign, the nation's and the people's destiny have never been more seriously threatened than at this moment. However, looking at the political situation in the central government, the Weng Cabinet has resigned without resigning (nominally resigned but still in charge), and President Sun has accepted without taking office (nominally appointed but has not yet formed a cabinet). This paralysis is occurring in the central government at a time when the war situation is extremely serious. This is truly the strangest thing in history, both ancient and modern, both in China and abroad. Even though the war has been raging for years, with countless lives sacrificed by soldiers and civilians in the fight for freedom, inexplicable political rumors continue to spread daily. A few politicians, mixed with some reporters who pass on hearsay, seem determined to serve as advance guards for the Communist bandits' political offensive, eager to undermine the morale of our troops on the front lines. The U.S. government spokesman has already debunked the "coalition government" rumor yesterday, but our central authorities remain indifferent and turn a deaf ear. This is truly the strangest of strange things!</p>
<p>First, we must remind those who harbor illusions of peaceful dreams: In theory, who doesn't yearn for peace? But peace is not about seeking temporary ease; peace must be linked to freedom. Otherwise, peace is no different from servitude. Only by being able to fight can we defend, and only by being able to defend can we negotiate peace. In the current situation, even if the central government cannot immediately launch an offensive, it must at least be able to fight and defend in order to be qualified to negotiate peace. Otherwise, it is not peace but surrender! But if we are capable of fighting and defending, then why negotiate peace with the Communist bandits? Furthermore, those who are resisting the National Government today are the Chinese Communists, who believe in communism, follow the orders of the Third International, rely on weapons from the Soviet Union, and whose organized troops include international members of the Japanese Communist Party, Korean Communist Party, and Mongolian Communist Party. What they want to control and deprive is the free life of our people, which is closely related to their vital interests. How can a government entrusted by its people negotiate peace with bandits who betray the country and harm the people? Our Northeast troops and Jinan troops previously laid down their arms due to the "coalition government" rumors, misled by a few unscrupulous generals, leading to the current perilous situation. If, at this time, when morale is high in the Xuzhou-Huaihai area, and our troops are building strong defenses and fighting to the death, we allow rumors of peace that shake the foundation of the nation to spread everywhere, it would be tantamount to serving as a vanguard for the Communist bandits' propaganda war. If there are no Qin Huis in the court, then there will be Yue Feis on the battlefield! If peace rumors become prevalent again, the detrimental effects on the front lines may become too terrible to imagine one day. Therefore, if the central government is determined to fight resolutely, it should first debunk unfounded rumors with actions and facts, so that opportunistic bureaucrats and politicians cannot use their tricks.</p>
<p>Second, throughout Chinese history, when using troops in the north, Hebei and Guanzhong have always been equally important, and in the south, the Huai defense has always taken precedence over the Yangtze defense. The current battle on the Huai River has lasted for over a month, with both sides employing all their strength. Let us first discuss the importance of the Bengbu-Suxian campaign. In the past, people have said that whoever controls the Huai River can resist the north, and whoever controls the Huai River can prevent the south from defending itself. Although transportation has changed slightly today, and the navy and air force can further strengthen the natural barrier of the Yangtze River, the strategic importance remains largely the same as in ancient times. During the Eastern Jin Dynasty, when Emperor Yuan crossed the Yangtze River, and until the Chen Dynasty, the Southern Dynasties resisted the northern barbarians for five generations. Yang Xingmi occupied the region and, until the Li family, refused to submit to China for three dynasties, all because they controlled the Huai River region. Without the Huai River, the Wu kingdom was eventually annexed by the Jin Dynasty, and without the Huai River, the Chen Dynasty was eventually annexed by the Sui Dynasty. It is evident that to secure the Yangtze River, one must first secure the Huai River; without the Huai defense, the Yangtze defense is also in danger. Liu Ji once said: "Throughout history, defending the Huai River has been most difficult for Xie Xuan, and even more difficult for Yang Xingmi. Xie Xuan used 8,000 men to face Fu Jian's army of 900,000, and in the battle of Qingkou, Yang Xingmi used 30,000 men to face Zhu Quanzhong's army from eight prefectures. Despite the disparity in numbers, they were able to win because they controlled the Huai River to resist the enemy and did not allow the enemy to enter the Huai River." Today, the battles in northern Jiangsu and northern Anhui are deadlocked in the same area as the Battle of Fei River, and it is precisely the decisive battle for the Huai River region. This is why our Supreme Commander has repeatedly deployed troops to reinforce the area. Central officials, frontline soldiers, and the people in the rear should recognize reality and attach great importance to this decisive battle in the southern theater, and mobilize all forces to fight for victory in this decisive battle. The outcome of this decisive battle is of immense importance! Victory does not depend on numerous small victories, but on victory in this decisive battle on the Huai River. But victory can never be achieved by those who lack confidence. The central government must eliminate elements of defeatism in order to achieve final victory.</p>
<p>Third, speaking of the fierce battles in the Tianjin-Beijing area of North China, we should fully trust General Fu Zuoyi, strengthen his forces as soon as possible, support his strategy, and, most importantly, encourage his soldiers to defend this famous city in Hebei. Throughout Chinese history, those who have fought for control of the country in the north have either used Guanzhong or Hebei, with Shanxi and Henan serving as their thoroughfares. Lü Donglai once said: "Those who used Guanzhong to conquer the country succeeded five times and failed three times, while those who used Hebei to conquer the country succeeded once and failed three times." He also said that the Zhou, Qin, and Han dynasties used Guanzhong, and Emperor Guangwu of the Han dynasty used Hebei. Only Cao Cao and Shi Le took Guanzhong by conquering Hebei, and Fu Jian took Hebei by conquering Guanzhong. All three controlled most of the country but ultimately failed to unify it. These assertions may not fully align with today's situation, but if the Communist bandits want to control the entire country, they must seize Hebei in the north and Guanzhong as well. The order may differ, but seizing both is inevitable sooner or later. Preparations should be made for the Guanzhong battles, but we will not discuss them for now. However, since Henan has already fallen into their hands, and only Taiyuan remains in Shanxi, the current situation in the north requires us to act swiftly and decisively to fight for this battle in the Tianjin-Beijing area, in order to stabilize the overall situation in Hebei. Lin Biao's bandit troops have entered the pass with all their strength, forced by Li Lisan and unable to retreat, resembling a desperate situation, determined to capture the area. However, General Fu is waiting at leisure, and his situation is far superior. If we are united from top to bottom, and civilians and soldiers cooperate, then with General Fu's veteran troops, known for their skillful defense, the heartfelt support of the people of North China, and the implementation of a strategy to shorten the defense lines and take the initiative, we dare to believe that Lin's bandit troops entering the pass will be defeated by this famous general in the suburbs of Tianjin and Beijing.</p>
<p>In conclusion, the current situation has deteriorated to this point due to past political failures, strategic errors, and the corruption of officials. This has left patriotic people in tears. If our central government does not curb the rumors at this time, and the people do not strive to defend themselves, but only seek temporary escape from difficulties and rush to seize benefits, even to the point of refusing to contribute even a single hair to alleviate the crisis, then I fear that the tragic situation of "before the discussion is settled, the Jin soldiers have crossed the river" may follow the footsteps of the Communist bandits' "fifth column"! Then there will be no time for regret.</p>
<p>The north-south decisive battles, which are related to the life and death of the nation, have begun simultaneously, yet the cabinet members who hold the reins of our central government are still sound asleep, dreaming. Nothing could be more absurd!</p>

<h3>Public Expenditure Standards for Leading Officials of Central Agencies Adjusted</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 15th] The case of adjusting the public expenditure standards for leading officials at all levels of central agencies was passed at the political affairs meeting on the 15th. This adjustment was made because the public expenditure standards were adjusted in accordance with the adjustment of the salaries of public school teachers in November. It was decided that starting from December, the standard for the entire Nanjing area would be increased by a factor of six. After increasing by a factor of six, the Premier would receive 1,200 yuan, the Vice Premier 960 yuan, the Minister 720 yuan, the Vice Minister 360 yuan, the Director 240 yuan, the Section Chief 120 yuan, and the Recommended Secretary 66 yuan.

<h3>Wartime Military Law to Prevent Rebellious Elements</h3>
<p>To be sent to the Legislative Yuan to complete the legislative process</p>

The draft was passed at the political affairs meeting on the 15th and will be sent to the Legislative Yuan to complete the legislative process.</p>
<h3>U.S. Military Advisory Group Assists Us in Training 60,000 Service Personnel; Reorganizes Our Military Based on the U.S. Military System</h3>
<p>[United Press, Nanjing, 15th] Despite the current tense environment, the U.S. Army Advisory Group is assisting the Chinese government in revitalizing a more efficient military organization, with "substantial and concrete" progress. According to U.S. sources, with the assistance of the U.S. Military Advisory Group, thirty basic service schools have been established in China, with 60,000 officers and technicians receiving training. U.S. advisors are reorganizing the Chinese military based on the U.S. military system as much as possible. Sources familiar with the matter indicate that there has been significant improvement in the care of Chinese soldiers' clothing, nutrition, and equipment. There is a severe lack of transportation equipment in China, especially railways. The Chinese Joint Logistics Command has now learned the U.S. technique of unloading cargo from trains in one and a half hours and unloading cargo from ships in one and a half days. Previously, it took workers three days to completely unload cargo from trains and four days for ships. Another example is the reorganization of the Chinese Ministry of National Defense, which was previously extremely inefficient, but has now been reorganized into the American style, with the First Bureau responsible for administration, the Second Bureau for intelligence, the Third Bureau for personnel, and the Fourth Bureau for materials. Before adopting this system, accurate planning, supply, and troop movement were nearly impossible. Now, all Chinese troops have records to act on a cooperative basis. Basic service schools include artillery, infantry, medicine, signals, and ordnance centers. The instructors are all Chinese officers, mixed with four U.S. officers. Two years ago, the U.S. military began training a small number of Chinese officers, who were then transferred to the front lines to train other officers or establish other service schools.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper, Zhangjiakou, 15th] Lower- and middle-level cadres and soldiers of Yao Zhe's bandit troops in Suiyuan expressed resentment towards Mao's bandits for creating famine and forcibly conscripting people into the army as cannon fodder.

The amended articles stipulate that the areas of implementation are the seven cities of Nanjing, Shanghai, Tianjin, Qingdao, Guangzhou, Wuhan, and Chongqing.

<h3>U.S. House Speaker Martin Announces: Our Control Yuan's Plea for Assistance Telegram; Legislative Yuan's Telegram Also Submitted to Congressional Committee for Consideration</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, San Francisco, 14th] The telegram from our Control Yuan to the U.S. Congress, appealing for increased aid to China to overcome the "urgent crisis" caused by communism and to safeguard the democratic way of life, was made public today by House Speaker Martin. The telegram was delivered by our Ambassador to the U.S., Gu Weijun, to Martin and Senate Speaker Vandenberg on the 11th of this month. Martin made no comment when he released the telegram. It is reported that the Legislative Yuan also sent a similar telegram to Martin and Vandenberg in the first week of December. Some observers believe that the telegram was sent directly to Congress, bypassing the White House and the State Department. The telegram stated: "If China is unfortunately overcome, the Far East will be turned red, and Asia and Europe will not be spared, and even the United States will hardly be safe." A spokesperson for our embassy in the United States stated that the Control Yuan's telegram to the U.S. Congress was sent by an elected body of one country to an elected body of another country, and there was no question of bypassing the executive branch of the U.S. government. The embassy also stated that submitting the Control Yuan's telegram to both houses of Congress was merely in response to a special request from the Control Yuan, and therefore this transmittal of the letter was "routine business" with no "special significance." The Control Yuan's telegram also stated that international communism is now using the old tricks of Germany and Japan to attack countries that love peace and democracy, and that China's communist rebellion is not merely a civil war, but an aggression against the democratic way of life and world peace. It also stated that China suffered severe damage in the Anti-Japanese War and is now forced to launch a great crusade against communism. If it must fight alone, it has no confidence in winning. Martin admitted that he had received telegrams from our Legislative Yuan and Control Yuan, and said that the two telegrams have been forwarded to the relevant committees of Congress for consideration. So far, the Legislative Yuan's appeal telegram has not been made public.</p>
<h3>U.S. Republican Congressman Calls for Effective Aid to China</h3>
<p>Miller Starts Drafting Plan</p>
<p>[United Press, Camden, New Jersey, 14th] Republican member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, Judd, said that the United States has injured China, and the best way to remedy it is to aid China immediately, lest it be too late. If China does not receive U.S. aid, it will fall under Soviet control, and in the end we will still have to stop the Soviet Union in China, so why not do it sooner? The current war against communism in China is the key to all world problems. Unless we quickly provide China with supplies, our investment in China will be exhausted, and the Marshall Plan will never be realized.</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 14th] Republican member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, Miller, said: "The United States should immediately and effectively aid China to prevent Asia from falling to communism. I have already started drafting an aid-to-China plan, preparing to submit it on the opening day of the new Congress next year, which stipulates an immediate aid of one billion dollars to China, sending a large-scale military advisory group to China to guide the government army in combat, and collecting land and sea transportation equipment to transport necessary military supplies. I hope this plan can be passed in time to help President Chiang."</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, New York, 14th] U.S. Republican Congressman Proust discussed the China crisis on the radio today and called on the United States to give effective assistance to President Chiang's government. The policy of the United States should be to do its best to support President Chiang's government, because Chiang is a hope for saving China from the scourge of the communists.</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 14th] Former Commander of the U.S. Eighth Army, General Eichelberger, will retire from military service at the end of this year. He said that if Japan succumbs to the communists after the withdrawal of troops from the occupied countries, he "will be frightened by the consequences." When asked what his opinion was on the situation in China, Eichelberger replied: "If the National Government fails and China turns red, then the victory in the Pacific in World War II is not a victory."</p>
<h3>U.S. Newspapers Demand Statement on China Policy</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, New York, 15th] The New York Times said in an editorial today that the U.S. government should issue a clear and authoritative statement on its China policy. The New York Times said that American taxpayers have the right to know the whole truth, because the current situation in China is important to every American.</p>
<p>[United Press, New York, 15th] Howard News said in a fifteenth editorial that Hoffman's remarks in Shanghai were a serious blow to the Chinese government. "We must condemn Hoffman's pronouncements at this time and place. This policy is contrary to the Truman Doctrine of resisting communist aggression." "The Soviet Union, through the Chinese Communist troops penetrating the Northeast and North China, has isolated our military position in Korea and Japan. The strategic interests of the United States in the Far East have long been greatly threatened. If Washington encourages the establishment of a coalition government in North China, then South China and Southeast Asia may follow suit." "Was the purpose of our participation in the Pacific War to replace the previous Japan with the Soviet Union? We can hardly imagine President Truman continuing his current China policy. If the President insists on this, we believe Congress will stop him."</p>

<h3>Following the Japanese Finance Minister's Gaffe Incident, MacArthur Supports the Yoshida Cabinet; Even if the Diet Dissolves, the Liberal Party Still Prevails in the General Election; New Budget Expected to Pass Late at Night</h3>
<p>[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 15th] As a result of the meeting of the Budget Committee of the Japanese House of Representatives at 11:00 a.m. today, it was decided to continue to review the budget proposed by the government, because Mr. Hodney, Director of the Civil Affairs Bureau of the General Headquarters, told the Speaker of the House of Representatives, Matsuoka, that "the budget amendment proposed by the opposition party (that is, the budget drafted according to the new salary standards set by the Provisional Personnel Committee) cannot be applied due to the government's financial resources." The new salary standard will still be based on a certain amount of 5,328 yen set by the Ministry of Finance of the government, and the implementation date of the new salary will begin on December 1, and no previous salaries will be retroactively compensated. It is generally believed that this instruction from MacArthur's headquarters was the result of discussions between Yoshida and the headquarters yesterday morning. Therefore, it is generally expected that although some parliamentarians have requested the resignation of the Yoshida cabinet after the Izumiyama incident, the headquarters of MacArthur has implied that it supports the Yoshida cabinet in maintaining the remaining situation, so it will definitely not resign en masse. Even if the Diet is dissolved, the Liberal Party will still be in an advantageous election position.</p>
<p>[United Press, Tokyo, 15th] The Yoshida Cabinet's Little Teaching Party and other opposition parties continued to argue over the new basic salary for civil servants on the afternoon of the 15th, but the budget is expected to pass late at night, and then the no-confidence vote against the Yoshida government is expected to pass. Yoshida is expected to dissolve the House of Representatives after the budget is passed in the upper house on the 17th. It is generally speculated that the general election of the new House of Representatives will be held in mid-January next year.</p>
<p>[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 15th] Minister Oya made his first statement to reporters after being appointed Minister of Finance on the 14th, saying: "Until the night of the 13th, the budget issue was proceeding very smoothly. Unfortunately, the situation changed due to Izumiyama's gaffe, and the relationship between the government and the opposition party deteriorated. However, it is expected to improve starting today."</p>
<p>[United Press, Tokyo, 15th] At a meeting of the Japanese parliament today, several opposition members demanded the immediate resignation of the Yoshida cabinet, on the grounds that Finance Minister Izumiyama's flirtation with female parliamentarians had completely lost the cabinet's decency.</p>
<h3>Indonesia Asks Security Council to Meet Immediately to Discuss Situation Between Netherlands and Indonesia to Prevent Situation from Worsening and to Find Ways to Resume Negotiations</h3>
<p>[This newspaper's report] Paris, 15th broadcast: The Republic of Indonesia requested the Security Council to meet immediately to discuss the tense situation between the Indonesian and Dutch troops. The Indonesian representative to the United Nations urged the President of the Security Council to pay attention to the report submitted by the United Nations Mediation Committee on Tuesday. The report stated that the current situation may escalate the war. He requested the Security Council to seek some ways to avoid the deterioration of the situation, and at the same time find ways to restore Indonesian-Dutch negotiations.</p>
<p>[French News Agency, The Hague, 15th] The Dutch cabinet held a very important cabinet meeting on the future of Indonesia. According to well-informed sources, the Dutch cabinet decided to take "police action" against the Republic of Indonesia, but the date of commencement has not yet been determined. The same source strongly claimed that this decision of the Dutch cabinet will not be changed by the statement announced by Indonesian Prime Minister Hatta on the 14th that Indonesia is willing to respect Dutch sovereignty during the transition period. Local well-informed sources believe that Hatta clearly expressed a compromise attitude, but this attitude is not approved by his cabinet colleagues and Indonesian military leaders. They also believe that the infiltration of Indonesian armed forces into West Java gives the Netherlands a reason to take military action at any time. According to the same source, the Netherlands may take action before the establishment of the Indonesian Provisional Federal Government to prevent the non-republican autonomous states in Indonesia from joining the Republic of Indonesia and working side by side with Indonesia against the Netherlands.</p>
<p>[United Press, The Hague, 14th] The Dutch cabinet held an emergency meeting all day today to discuss the new note submitted by Indonesian Prime Minister Hatta. The content of the note has not been announced, but according to reliable sources, Indonesia is willing to recognize Dutch sovereignty over Indonesia during the transition period. The Dutch government originally intended to establish the Indonesian Provisional Federal Government without waiting for the participation of the Republic of Indonesia, but it has now been suspended.</p>
<p>[French News Agency, Washington, 14th] Indonesian Representative to Washington, Dr. Sumitro, said today that the Security Council will soon try to resume negotiations between Indonesia and the Netherlands to find a peaceful solution. He also said: This hope is based on reliable sources, and this negotiation will be re-launched under the auspices of the Mediation Committee. If the war in Indonesia resumes, the communists will benefit the most. It should be known that the impact of the Indonesian incident will affect the entire Asia.</p>
<p>[French News Agency, The Hague, 14th] The Economic Cooperation Administration's representative in the Netherlands, Height, today denied rumors that the Netherlands had used U.S. funds to purchase weapons and military equipment for the Dutch army in Indonesia.</p>
<h3>Japan and Siam Sign Trade Agreement</h3>
<p>[United Press, Tokyo, 15th] MacArthur's headquarters announced today that Japan has signed a trade agreement with Siam, stipulating a trade value of 60 million U.S. dollars, which is the first trade agreement after the war. Japan will export railway vehicles, building materials, porcelain, electrical materials, cotton fabrics, glass, leadware, chemicals, and paper worth 7 million U.S. dollars to Siam. Siam will supply Japan with beans, salt, tin, leather, and local goods.</p>
<h3>South Korea Celebrates Vigorously After Being Recognized by United Nations</h3>

President Syngman Rhee addressed the masses, followed by parades of army units and youth group members in the streets.</p>
<h3>Former Commander of U.S. Eighth Army, Eichelberger, Advocates Equipping New Japanese Army with 150,000 Troops as International Anti-Communist Force</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 14th] Former Commander of the U.S. Eighth Army, Lieutenant General Eichelberger, pointed out when interviewed by a United Press reporter on the 14th that there is an "extreme importance" in establishing a well-equipped Japanese security force. He said that there are two possible methods: (1) Arm all the existing 125,000 police officers and increase the number to 150,000; (2) Maintain the existing police force as it is and establish a brand new security force with up to 150,000 people.</p>
<p>Eichelberger said that he favored the second method, and said that the force established by the second method would be a national security force responsible for international defense. He said that the maximum number of this force should be limited to 150,000 people, and should only be equipped with small arms. "If they are not well-equipped, they will be useless." Eichelberger also said that when he left Japan, all 125,000 police officers had only 18,000 pistols. When discussing the need for an organized Japanese armed security force, Eichelberger said: "When the communists on the Asian continent march south on a large scale, this move is even more important to Japan." He continued: "When the Allies defeated Japan without the help of the communists--I solemnly declare, without the help of the communists--we eliminated the obstacles to preventing the communists from marching south. The result of eliminating the obstacles is more important than any concessions we made to the Soviet Union at the Yalta Conference or the Potsdam Conference. When we defeated Japan, we destroyed the balance of power in Asia." Although Eichelberger did not explicitly state what kind of obstacles were eliminated, he clearly meant the Japanese Kwantung Army occupying the Northeast.</p>

<h3>French New Budget to be Discussed in Congress on Monday</h3>
<p>Total Expenditure Close to Two Trillion Francs</p>
<p>[French News Agency, Paris, 14th] The French Parliament will begin discussing the 1949 budget bill starting next week. According to the draft budget, France's expenditure next year will reach 1,865 billion francs, two-thirds of which is the current budget, including the civil affairs budget of 750 billion francs, the national equipment maintenance fee of 150 billion francs, and the military budget of 350 billion francs. This expenditure will be fully offset by tax revenue. The other one-third of the budget, about 611 billion francs, is a special budget, including construction costs of 270 billion francs, and construction costs of the Monnet four-year plan of 310 billion francs. The expenditure under the special budget will be paid partly by tax revenue and partly by domestic and foreign debt. It is estimated that U.S. loans can obtain 280 billion francs, and tax revenue can obtain 135 billion francs, so domestic debt of about 200 billion francs is still needed. The new draft budget reduces the military budget from 440 billion francs to 320 billion francs, and requires efforts to save government office expenses.</p>

It was decided: to ask the Social Affairs Bureau to urgently seek remedial measures.

Barbers should charge double fees at the end of the year, and the doubled part should belong to the employees. The tricycle business should be exempted from rent for a certain number of days as the year-end bonus for tricycle drivers.

This was jointly announced by US Consul General Cabot and Shanghai US Naval Commander Rear Admiral Crawford at a press conference yesterday. After the marines arrive in Shanghai, they will remain on the ship and land at any time in response to changes in the situation to protect the lives and property of American overseas Chinese in Shanghai. Ambassador Stuart, Consul General Cabot, and Rear Admiral Crawford will decide when the situation is urgent and the marines need to land to protect overseas Chinese based on the actual situation. The US Consul General solemnly stated that the Marines are here entirely to protect overseas Chinese, have no intention of creating a public concession in Shanghai, and have no intention of internationalizing Shanghai. All actions fully respect China's sovereignty. Maintaining order in an emergency is the responsibility of the Chinese authorities. The Marines have no plans to cooperate with local self-defense business groups.</p>

As for whether American overseas Chinese who take refuge on ships should go ashore if the "crisis" situation disappears in the short term, individuals can decide for themselves based on the facts. In addition to this, the Marines who came to Shanghai this time had previously been stationed in Guam. One company is commanded by Captain Blyth, and the other company is commanded by Captain Lewis. The supply unit is commanded by Major Williams, and Colonel Hughes is in charge of the overall situation. According to Rear Admiral Crawford, there are no plans to increase the number of Marines coming to Shanghai at present.</p>
<p>After the US Warship Arrives in Shanghai, It Will Dock at Yangshupu Wharf</p>
<p>Cabot also said that there was no special significance in choosing this week for the Marines to come to Shanghai. The "Belknap" will dock at a US naval site so that the Marines have the opportunity to conduct field exercises and entertainment nearby. Cabot said that the State Department's policy remains unchanged, "The State Department still hopes that non-essential American overseas Chinese can leave first so that those who have to stay here for duty can be properly protected. The plan discussed today is consistent with what Lieutenant General Badger, Commander of the Western Pacific, announced the day before yesterday. The decision of American overseas Chinese to stay or leave is up to them. Of course, we have no right to force them to leave Shanghai or drag them out of the country. We should understand every possibility, but we do not intend to stipulate which overseas Chinese are essential and which are not. This should be decided by them based on the facts."</p>
<p>Rear Admiral Crawford also solemnly stated that the arrival of the Marines in Shanghai is only accidental and does not mean that the situation has deteriorated today.</p>

<h3>Jiuchang Weaving Factory Workers Forced to Stop Work; Request Mediation</h3>
<p>The Jiuchang Weaving Factory in Nanshi recently insisted on re-signing the bonus agreement with the workers, but the workers refused to sign because the content was too harsh. Unexpectedly, the factory stopped work, and although the factory's industrial union repeatedly mediated and requested the factory to consider the difficulties of the times and allow them to resume work, they were rejected. They are now requesting the mediation of the General Labor Union.</p>
<h3>The Council Meeting of the General Labor Union Decided on Many Important Cases; Living Allowance for Draftees Should Be Reduced; Request Improvement of Key Rice Rationing</h3>
<p>The Municipal General Labor Union held its first council meeting after the re-election at 3 PM on the 14th. After discussion, the following resolutions were made: (1) The living allowance for draftees. Workers have paid according to the lowest standard in previous years. Now, they have received a notice from the Military Service Association that they need to pay 1.2 dan and 2 dan, etc. It was decided to send council members Shen Shousi and Xi Xiangsheng to the Military Service Association to negotiate. It is hoped that workers can still pay according to the lowest standard. (2) Regarding the key rice rationing for industrial and professional workers this time, about 10,000 workers cannot get household rice coupons because their household registration has not been reported, and they cannot buy their key rice rationing. It was decided: to ask the Social Affairs Bureau to urgently seek remedial measures. If the key rice rationing for next month is still not improved, the workers are willing to voluntarily give up the rice rationing. It is also hoped that the authorities will handle the distribution of oil and briquettes for November as soon as possible. (3) Recently, the situation has been turbulent, and many factories have used the excuse of suspending business or relocating factories. Industrial unions in the Western medicine, machinery, cigarette, and wool spinning industries have requested assistance. It was decided to send council members Shi Wenbin, Yao Ligen, Wu Guoying, and Huang Yuezhen to the municipal government to petition, demanding the establishment of a specialized agency to handle the suspension and relocation of factories. (4) The association agrees in principle to the year-end bonus distribution method passed by the municipal government. Industrial workers should receive the same treatment as office workers for the year-end bonus. Professional workers can negotiate on their own according to past practice. Barbers should charge double fees at the end of the year, and the doubled part should belong to the employees. The tricycle business should be exempted from rent for a certain number of days as the year-end bonus for tricycle drivers. (5) The Central Bank is exchanging gold and silver, but workers are unable to queue up due to production reasons. They requested the Central Bank to allocate gold to them. It was decided to hand over the matter to the Standing Council to formulate a method and request it from the authorities.</p>
<h3>Accelerate the Handling of Traitorous Property Housing; Original Resident Traitor Families May Be Allowed to Purchase with Priority</h3>
<p>Regarding the property and houses of traitors, after the court confirms the confiscation, in addition to the living expenses that the traitor's family can receive at its discretion, the houses they live in must also be confiscated and returned. Currently, many traitor's families are finding it difficult to find housing and earnestly request the Enemy and Puppet Property Clearance Office to change the handling method. The Enemy Property Office drafted a method and requested instructions from the Executive Yuan. The Executive Yuan has now replied: "The houses lived in by the families of traitors are also of a custodial nature. After the confiscation is confirmed, they should naturally be returned to the state. Now, in order to speed up the handling, the original resident traitor families may be allowed to purchase with priority." The office has now issued a notice to all its branches to handle the matter according to this instruction.</p>

<p>National Bank Discount and Loan Committee Decides on Future Agricultural Loan Policy</p>
<p>Adopting a Key Points Approach with All Calculations Based on Actual Goods</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper] The Central Bank's Discount and Loan Committee recently held its 18th meeting, approving 11 cases related to agricultural and mining companies, transportation, etc., and made decisions on future agricultural loan policies. The main points are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) In order to effectively increase production, meet the needs of farmers, and ensure that loans benefit farmers, future agricultural loans should adopt a key points approach, limited to important areas and areas where handling banks can effectively control and strictly supervise.</p>
<p>(2) Future agricultural loans should primarily be issued in kind. Whether for direct lending in kind or converting to cash, the principle should be to recover in kind. Allocation, repayment of principal, and interest payments should all be calculated based on actual goods.</p>
<p>(3) The interest rate for agricultural loans in kind is set at 0.8% per month.</p>
<p>Large Arrivals, Slow Sales: Rice Continues Downstream, Flour and Oil Prices Fall Across the Board</p>
<p>The rice market is weak and declining due to large arrivals and slow sales, making it difficult to stabilize prices. Initially, sellers were asking for the original price, but buying interest was weak. More samples were being offered in the central market, leading to lower prices. In the southern market, Japonica rice fell by 10 yuan, trading at 355 yuan, while thin Indica rice weakened slightly by 5 yuan. High-quality early-season rice opened at 340 yuan, down 10 yuan, while Indica glutinous rice was relatively stable. In the northern market, Japonica and thin Indica rice each fell by 5 yuan, while early-season rice remained unchanged, but sales were very slow, making the market very weak. Yesterday, the two markets received a total of 10,593 piculs of goods.</p>
<p>Flour:</p>
<p>Continued to decline. The market opened with declining prices in related industries and soft sentiment, with everyone anticipating a decrease. Many retail investors were still selling, while warehouses showed little interest. Old brand flour opened and closed at 140 yuan, a decrease of 13 yuan compared to yesterday. Military ship flour traded at 137 yuan at closing, also down 13 yuan. Red Bee fell by 10 yuan, Jiancheng fell by 7 yuan, and miscellaneous brands fell by 12-13 yuan each. Wheat bran also fell by 4 yuan.</p>
<p>Grains:</p>
<p>Prices fell across the board. With declining rice prices, market sentiment was dampened, and buyers temporarily closed their doors. Sales were slow. Soybeans slightly declined by 5 yuan. Although corn from the northern region was moving, buyers were very demanding, and prices fell by 10 yuan. Red sorghum was being offered more than purchased, with few transactions, and prices fell by 10 yuan. Sesame seeds slightly declined by 10 yuan, and raw peanuts also fell by 30-40 yuan.</p>
<p>Edible Oil:</p>
<p>Prices turned sharply downward. The market opened relatively stable, but rumors strengthened selling pressure midway, and prices in related industries were weak. Sellers were dumping inventory. Although factories were not selling, large amounts of repossessed goods were being released. Soybean oil retreated to 1,000 yuan, closing at 950 yuan. Rapeseed oil closed at 850 yuan, each down 100 yuan. Raw oil fell sharply by 150 yuan, and small-batch sesame oil fell significantly by 180 yuan. Soybean cake fell slightly by 3-4 yuan.</p>
<p>Export Settlement Amount Increased Significantly Last Week</p>
<p>Totaling US$7.3 Million</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper] The amount of foreign exchange settlement applied for export goods from Shanghai last week (December 5th to 11th) increased significantly compared to the past, totaling over US$7.3 million, breaking the record for weekly settlement amounts. This includes over US$4 million in export goods settled directly by the government (frozen eggs, gauze, ore, sugar).</p>
<p>Uniform Visa for Barter Trade: Rotating Management Committee Formulates Measures</p>
<p>Barter Debt Repayment to the Soviet Union to be Completed by the End of the Month</p>
<p>Our country's barter trade with the Soviet Union, France, Japan, Italy, the United States, etc., is actively underway. However, due to the different currency systems and varying prices in the United States, the Soviet Union, France, Japan, Italy, etc., the visa procedures for imported goods need to be handled separately. The Export Management Committee believes that there are many cases of import through this barter trade. If handled separately, the procedures would be too cumbersome and would waste manpower and resources. Now, to save and simplify, a uniform visa method for foreign barter trade has been formulated. All barter materials from various countries, when imported, will be uniformly visaed according to this method, without separate handling.</p>
<p>It is also reported that although our country has completed transactions in barter trade with various countries, imports have been temporarily delayed due to the current situation. However, the barter debt repayment to the Soviet Union is still continuing. Because it is entirely in the nature of debt repayment, this barter debt repayment can be completed before the end of this month.</p>
<p>Furthermore, in order to adapt to actual needs, the Export Management Committee has decided to "simplify its organization" and establish a Shanghai office to specifically oversee Shanghai's import and export trade matters. The Export Management Committee will only be responsible for the design and supervision of the four major offices nationwide. Once the Shanghai office is established, the Export Management Committee can operate freely. Currently, Shanghai's business is concurrently handled by the Export Management Committee, so the organization is quite large. The relevant measures have been submitted to the Executive Yuan for review and approval, and the office will be established as soon as it is approved.</p>
<p>Industrial Loans to be Reviewed Today: The Scope of Purchase of Daily Necessities May Be Relaxed</p>
<p>Mr. Lin Chongyong, Chief Secretary of the Central Bank's Discount and Loan Committee, told reporters yesterday morning that since the National Bank decided to resume its discount and loan policy, applications from various factories have been very enthusiastic. To date, there have been about 30 applications requesting the purchase of finished products, including cotton textiles, leather, new drugs, and machinery industries, with the machinery industry being the most numerous. The Emergency Industrial Loan Review Committee of the Discount and Loan Committee has decided to begin reviewing them today. As for cases of re-pledging, because they need to be handled through banks, the committee has not yet received any applications. However, it is expected that a large number of applications will arrive within a day or two. Mr. Lin stated that the National Bank's decision to resume discount and loan is due to the approaching end of the year, when factories need a large amount of capital to cover workers' year-end bonuses and other expenses. The committee is also closely monitoring the potential impact of loan releases on the market's monetary situation. The quantity of applications from each factory will be based on the factory's actual situation and the impact on the market as the final criteria. Regarding the scope of finished product purchases, the National Bank has also decided in principle that products that are daily necessities can be relaxed in order to coordinate with price controls and facilitate currency management.</p>
<p>Decline in Import and Export Trade: Fluctuations in Foreign Exchange Certificates</p>
<p>The official exchange rate for overseas remittances rose by another 2 yuan yesterday, to 52 yuan. The market price for foreign exchange transfer certificates initially traded at 50.5 yuan, then rose to 53 yuan, an increase of 2.5 yuan from the previous day. According to import and export traders, import and export trade has been very sluggish recently. There are fewer foreign exchange funds available for sale from exporters, and the needs of importers have also decreased significantly. The number of transactions each day is not large, and small transactions are prone to fluctuations. It is easy to rise, but also easy to fall back. It is predicted that if the situation stabilizes slightly, import and export trade can be greatly boosted. At that time, the trading of foreign exchange transfer certificates will return to normal, and overseas remittance income can also increase sharply.</p>
<p>Tea Market Bullish Sentiment Intensifies</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper] This reporter recently met with a prominent tea merchant, who reported that since the authorities restored export loans and foreign exchange transfer certificates, which are beneficial for exports, buying sentiment among exporters such as Taishi, Xiehe, and Yihuo has become even stronger and uncontrollable. However, sellers are becoming increasingly reluctant to sell, resulting in very few transactions and a further expansion of price increases. As for domestic floral teas, the market in this area is also active due to loose credit and added speculative investment, with prices initially rising sharply in the morning before gradually leveling off as sellers took profits, but still ultimately ending higher than before.</p>
<p>Sugar Market Declines</p>
<p>The sugar market was consistently weak yesterday. Sellers in the northern region were actively dumping inventory, while buyers in this area were unenthusiastic and sentiment was soft. Asking prices fell across the board. No. 4 and 5 refined white sugar initially traded at 445 yuan, gradually decreasing in each subsequent transaction, closing at 430 yuan, a decrease of 20 yuan. Medium and coarse sugar each fell by 25 yuan, and other white clay sugar from this factory also fell by 10-15 yuan.</p>
<p>Bank Bureau Revises Domestic Exchange Rate</p>
<p>The domestic exchange rate for the Four Banks and Two Bureaus and One Treasury will be revised from the 16th as follows: Guangdong Province: Guangzhou 100 yuan, Shantou and Haikou 150 yuan each, Zhanjiang 200 yuan; Guangxi Province: Ganzhou, Guilin, Shuzhou, and Nanning 100 yuan each; Hunan Province: Changsha, Hengyang, and Yuanling 70 yuan each; Hubei Province: Hankou 50 yuan; Sichuan Province: Chengdu 150 yuan, Wanxian and Zigong 200 yuan each; Guizhou Province: Guiyang 150 yuan; Yunnan Province: Kunming 150 yuan; Hebei Province: Tianjin and Beijing 50 yuan each; other regions remain unchanged.</p>
<p>Tung Oil Buying Sentiment Prevalent</p>
<p>In the tung oil market yesterday, white oil, which meets standards for export, was in high demand as exporters rushed to meet shipping deadlines, creating a lively atmosphere. Prices also reached their peak, reaching as high as 820 yuan per dan. While transactions for Hongjiang tung oil remained quiet, the trend was still upward.</p>
<p>Silk Prices Plummet</p>
<p>Rumors circulated incessantly in the silk market yesterday. Negative news prevailed, and sentiment was consistently weak, causing the market to decline.</p>
<p>No. 120 Tianqiao opened at 13,000 yuan in the morning, a sharp decrease of 3,000 yuan compared to the previous day's market price. Retail investors were selling actively, while buyers absorbed the supply, causing the market to soften and then rise. Finally, silk weavers sought to buy at lower prices, improving sentiment and causing asking prices to rebound to 13,500 yuan at closing. In the afternoon, prices in related industries fell across the board, increasing selling pressure while buyers were waiting and watching. Asking prices continued to fall by 500 yuan. Dongyang, Jin San, and Ma brands all declined.</p>
<p>Raw Silk: The market continued to weaken in the morning. Except for a few purchases from warehouses, transactions were very scarce. Silk weavers in this area were also unenthusiastic to buy due to the softening of yarn and the stagnation of silk sales, causing market prices to continue to fall. D-grade 78 evenness fell by 1,000 yuan to 15,500 yuan, and premium retail also fell by 1,000 yuan to 15,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Silk Fabric: The market opened lower yesterday, gradually declining downstream. Sentiment was soft, and the market continued to decline. Meiya opened at 10,000 yuan in the morning. Selling pressure was strong after the opening, and the trend was weak, falling all the way to 9,500 yuan at closing. Huaqiang closed at 9,200 yuan, each falling by more than 1,000 yuan. In the afternoon, sentiment outside the market became even weaker, and holders were eager to sell, creating a chaotic market with asking prices continuing to fall by 500-600 yuan.</p>
<p>Spot Cotton Weak:</p>
<p>The spot cotton market tended to be slightly weak yesterday morning. In the afternoon, sentiment was unsustainable. However, due to scarce purchases, transactions were not active. Jingyang flower, Hankou fine velvet, and Huoji brands opened at three levels, with 250 bales traded. Zhoupu seed cotton traded at 270-285 yuan.</p>
<p>Strong Selling Atmosphere: Cotton Yarn Stops Rising and Falls, Cotton Cloth Suddenly Rebounds, Transactions Sluggish</p>
<p>The yarn market stopped rising and fell. There was a strong selling atmosphere in the market, and holders were unwilling to defend their positions, selling actively, causing the market to turn sharply downward.</p>
<p>42-count Blue Phoenix initially opened 2,500 yuan higher than before, at 15,000 yuan. Later, as replacers purchased actively, the price rebounded to 16,200 yuan at closing, resulting in a decrease of 1,300 yuan compared to the previous day. 40-count Blue Phoenix also fell by 1,300 yuan. 32-count Silver Moon opened at 13,500 yuan, once reaching as high as 14,600 yuan.</p>
<p>21-count Double Horse spot opened at 14,000 yuan, and although it initially rose to 14,600 yuan, it was unsustainable at closing, retreating to 12,900 yuan, a decrease of 1,700 yuan. 20-count Double Horse was at 11,600 yuan, ultimately falling by 700 yuan. 16-count Guangming and 10-count Boy Scout each closed at 8,500 yuan.</p>
<p>Cotton Cloth Suddenly Rebounds: The market opened lower for each type of cotton cloth, and although sellers tried to raise prices, actual sales were weak, and the trend was lifeless, ultimately becoming sluggish.</p>
<p>Dragon Head fine cloth initially opened at 475 yuan, and once rose to 490 yuan midway, but ultimately closed close to the opening price, at 480 yuan, resulting in a severe drop of 60 yuan compared to before. Medium-grade fine cloth such as Five Blessings and Trumpet Boy were both at 430 yuan, each falling by 4-5 yuan.</p>
<p>Four Gentlemen Yuan Biji opened at 505 yuan, then retreated to 480 yuan. At closing, there was a slight rebound, with the market price returning to 490 yuan, a decrease of 55 yuan. Golden Lotus Wonderful Dance Yuan Biji ultimately fell by 50 yuan, closing at 470 yuan. Four Gentlemen Yuan Zhigong initially opened at 515 yuan, once falling as low as 495 yuan, but then rebounded to 520 yuan at closing, a decrease of 45 yuan compared to before. Other cloth also tended to decline.</p>
<p>China Textile Sells Yarn:</p>
<p>Rumors were rampant, and sentiment was low, causing reluctance to buy yarn and cloth, with very few sales. Yesterday, China Textile offered six types of yarn, but only 27 pieces were sold, totaling 393,000 yuan in gold standard currency. The prices sold were: 20-count Gold Ingot (tax excluded) 9,200 yuan, 15-count Water Moon 8,000 yuan, 32-count Double Strand Half Year 15,500 yuan, 40TK Sunlight 19,000 yuan, 42-count Double Strand Red Liuma 15,000 yuan, 60-count Sunlight 19,000 yuan.</p>
<p>6th District Textile Union Discusses Cotton Allocation Issues</p>
<p>Ratio of Yarn to Cotton Does Not Match Cost, Plans to Request Increase</p>
<p>The 6th District Textile Union held a business director and supervisor meeting the day before yesterday to discuss how to handle the cotton already purchased in the first phase of participation in the National Cotton Joint Purchasing Association, as well as the ratio of yarn to be paid for the second batch of U.S. aid cotton. The following resolutions were reached:</p>
<p>(1) The cotton already purchased by the National Cotton Joint Purchasing Association, allocated to private yarn factories, is estimated to be over 4,000 dan. The amount of cotton individually allocated is very small. It was decided to sell it to the Joint Purchasing Association at market price and return the discounted amount.</p>
<p>(2) The original ratio of U.S. aid cotton does not cover costs, and it is proposed to request an increase. It was decided to send Standing Director Wang Zijian and others to request this from the Economic Cooperation Sub-Bureau and the U.S. Aid Utilization Committee.</p>
<p>A spokesperson for the Union claimed that the previous ratio for calculating U.S. aid cotton was set during the price control period, so the ratio was very low. Now, due to increased labor and service fees and consolidated taxes, the original ratio can no longer maintain costs, hence this request.</p>
<p>Commercial Briefs:</p>
<p>The foreign price of foreign pine is 1.5 cents per foot. If calculated at an exchange rate of 50 yuan per foreign exchange transfer certificate, each foot would be equivalent to 7.5 yuan in gold standard currency. Adding customs duties, each foot would cost at least around 10 yuan. However, the current market price is only 4.5-5 yuan, which is only half of the cost.</p>
<p>The market price of tin foil is stable, with supply and demand in balance. Liuyang Niukou war cannons are being gradually restocked for sale in this area, and the market is showing strength. Exports of Quick Bow were slightly more active than last week, and market prices are also firm.</p>
<p>Sentiment in the pig iron market is trending upwards, with asking prices generally rising. Australian iron is at 2,500 yuan, and Taiwanese and Hong Kong iron is at 1,600-1,700 yuan. However, due to factory closures and rumors of relocation to the south, actual sales remain weak. The allocation price of pig iron from the Resources Committee remains at 2,400 yuan per ton, but few are applying for allocation.</p>
<p>The market for medicinal materials is showing mixed trends, with some prices rising and others falling, but trading in the market remains sluggish. The asking price for Haimen Luopi is 32 yuan, but there are few buyers.</p>
<p>Sentiment for bricks and tiles has turned firm, with prices for bricks and tiles of all sizes rising by 400-500 yuan. Cement is opening at 55 yuan and is gaining momentum. This is because Ma brand cement produced in Tanggu, Tianjin, is no longer being delivered, and Taishan cement produced in Longtan, Nanjing, lacks transportation.</p>

<p>The Black Shops on Shenyu Road</p>
<p>Our Reporter: Jin Tao</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 10th (Airmail)] The Northeast has changed color. Vehicles and pedestrians are now traveling on the left side of the road instead of the right. Everything else has also been reorganized, implementing a different set of rules. Due to various circumstances, most military and civil servants cannot survive in that environment, and have no choice but to embark on the path they have chosen.</p>
<p>From Changchun to Pan Yang, from Shenyang to Jinzhou, from Jinzhou to Shanhaiguan, and from Shanhaiguan to west of the Luan River, there are large numbers of people traveling this road. This torrent is flowing, especially on the section from Shenyang to within the Pass. Among them are ordinary civil servants and teachers, wounded soldiers, "liberated" soldiers, and special figures in politics and the military. Some are disguised, some are in their original form, a colorful spectacle.</p>
<p>A Meal That Scares People</p>
<p>The villagers along the highway from Pan Yang to Shanhaiguan have found an opportunity to make money. Flatbread, millet porridge, large pancakes, boiled sweet potatoes, and sorghum rice have all become precious commodities. Dust and filth are no longer important to people. Not washing hands and faces for several days is not considered strange, because everyone is tolerating dirt and grime. I remember being scolded for rinsing my mouth and wiping my face in Hongluoxian, 30 kilometers west of Jinxi.</p>
<p>The small shops and kitchens along the highway, which were closed or suspended when trains were running smoothly, have now reopened and increased in number. A red circle is hung in front of the door, adorned with a piece of bright red cloth, which is the best lodging for these western migrants. Sleeping on a dirt kang for a night, or lying on a pile of straw on the ground, requires paying a high price. According to the bandit regime's exchange rate of 10 yuan gold standard currency to 1,000 yuan bandit money, that would be 100 yuan gold standard currency. Eating a meal of sorghum rice and white tofu soup would cost an additional meal fee equivalent to about 150 yuan gold standard currency.</p>
<p>Ten or twenty people sleep on one kang, crowding and pushing each other, but no one cares, because those who come later have to sleep on the pile of straw on the ground. This is several levels lower than the small shops "where you can see the sky at cockcrow." Everyone calls these dim, filthy, and deceiving places "black shops."</p>
<p>Risky River Crossing Carts</p>
<p>The Da Ling River is flowing with ice. The huge iron bridge is broken and cannot be reconnected, lying askew. Although the water is not very deep, it is quite turbulent. Carts and military and civilian pedestrians waiting to cross the river fill the east bank of the river. "Water bandits" wearing backward-facing fur pants are standing in the river testing the water. Passengers sit on top of the carts, and must run across the river in one go. People shout, horses neigh, ice blocks collide. The carters shout "Wo!", "Yu!", "Jue!", lashing the horses with whips. In this tense scene, many people overturn and fall into the water. Some drown, and some lose their belongings. Many "liberated" soldiers sell military supplies along the way in exchange for food and spending money, traveling at night and enduring hardship. Because they are suffering the consequences of the evil deeds of bad people in the past, they are subject to much discrimination and hear many harsh words. On the east bank of the Da Ling River, they insist on taking the "river crossing cart" to cross the river. The "river crossing cart" is a business of risk, and can only carry four people at a time. These soldiers are not paying, and the river crossing cart waits until it has enough passengers before crossing the river. Adding one more person would be dangerous. The carter shouts and curses, pushing them down. The soldiers glare, and the other side does not show weakness. Some people say that the carter is beating "a dog that has fallen into the water." There are many "river crossing carts" in the river. Due to being overloaded or being hit by ice blocks, they overturn, injuring people and killing horses. The scene is tragic.</p>
<p>Fierce District Yazi</p>
<p>There are countless bandit military checkpoints along the way in Heishan, Beizhen, and the Da Ling River. Each village and town has three or four or more. They check, interrogate, and demand travel permits. Some can read, some look at the red stamps, and some take pedestrians and carts to their platoon or company headquarters and hand them over to their political workers for questioning, delay, and detention.</p>
<p>Some staff members of the bandit "district government" deliberately make things difficult for pedestrians, cheating and extorting, which is unbearable and infuriating. Everyone calls these people "district yazi." Seeing pedestrians' watches and fountain pens, they offer ridiculous prices to buy them. In order to reduce trouble, pedestrians are happy to agree. At night in secluded places, they also confiscate people's gold jewelry and property.</p>
<p>Heishan and Beizhen are "old liberated areas." The bandit's local administrative organization is deeply rooted. They are particularly strict and ruthless in checking, interrogating, or detaining people. Everyone has a mutually cautionary saying: "In Heishan, even a goose loses a feather," and "In Beizhen, it is difficult to fly away even with wings." I don't know how many people have suffered there, and how many people have suffered because they were considered "not honest." The reporter suffered greatly in Beizhen.</p>
<p>Calling You "Stop A While"</p>
<p>The bandit "farmers' associations" in the townships around Suizhong have also been organized. In many villages, farmers use manure shovels to pick up cow and horse manure while asking pedestrians for travel permits. Some small stalls selling millet porridge and large pancakes do business and ask you to stop for questioning at the same time. If you drink a bowl of his millet porridge and eat a piece of pancake, he will show a very welcoming attitude. Some are planning to buy one or two items of clothing from the passers-by, so they call you to stop a while or stand a while so they can take the opportunity to get some cheap items. According to their saying, it is "for the public" and "production," without interfering with each other. In some places, "children's corps" are holding red-tasseled spears and asking for travel permits. Pedestrians who meet them should call "Little Brother" a few more times, and those who meet older farmers' association members should call "Grandpa" a few more times, which will lead to benefits and advantages.</p>
<p>In order to hurry on the road and reduce trouble, many people get up after midnight. Although the night is dark, the starry sky indicates the direction and also tells the pedestrians the time. Wild temples, deserted villages, mountains, and gullies have all been imprinted with the footprints of these people. Traveling again and again, in this 20th-century era, they are re-experiencing the life and suffering of the 18th century.</p>
<p>Su Bei Peng Zhutian Killed in Jiangnan Road</p>
<p>Refugees, Please Look at This Mirror</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Wujin, 13th] Peng Zhutian from Donghe, originally the village head, fled last year due to the tense situation and lived in Wanshiqiao, Yixing for a long time. This spring, he moved to Lijiaqiao Town in Qianhuang District of this county and opened the Gongshenghe oil, rice, and grain store with a friend. Business was not bad. Recently, fellow villagers from Wanshiqiao bought more than 20 mu of land, and Peng was invited to write the contract as a fellow villager. On the 13th, after Peng finished his work, he took a bus to Yuncun around 11:00 AM and was walking back to Li Town when he was suddenly attacked by three plainclothes bandits near Lukeng Village, who hacked him with knives and axes for six or seven blows to the head. Peng was caught off guard and fell to the ground in a pool of blood. A passing monk glimpsed the scene and rushed to report it to the local village office. The murderers had already fled. After identification, they immediately reported it to the Lijiaqiao grain store to arrange the funeral and reported it to the county to arrest the murderers. General speculation is that it was either a revenge killing or an assassination by bandits, but there are no clues as to the cause. The difficulty of being a refugee can be seen from this.</p>
<p>Relief for the War Zone on the Jinpu Line</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Bengbu, 12th] This time, the residents of villages and towns such as Huoxingmiao, Maojiagou, Chizhuang, Suji, and Zhujiagang Shiqiao in the northern countryside of Huaiyuan on the Jinpu Line suffered miserably from the devastation by bandit troops and the destruction of artillery fire. They were displaced and extremely pitiful. Peng Liren and Song Zixin, the steady-profit relief workers sent by the Ministry of Social Affairs to Bengbu, have been personally taking money to the disaster-stricken villages and distributing accounts for days, 40 yuan per person in the severely affected areas and 20 yuan per person in the slightly affected areas. It is learned that Peng and others will continue to Qianzhan to provide practical relief.</p>
<p>Suzhou Meiqi Theater Suffers Losses, Demands Compensation from Soochow University</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Suzhou, 15th (Wire)] The Theatre Industry Association convened an emergency meeting today and resolved to demand compensation from Soochow University for the losses suffered by Meiqi. At the same time, it sent representatives to the City Defense Department to petition for a guarantee that similar incidents would not occur in the future. The department then sent personnel with the person in charge of the association to Soochow University to negotiate, but the university denied that the students had destroyed it and said that they should not further provoke student emotions and that they could compromise and resolve the matter peacefully. In the end, the university agreed to assist in the investigation of the lost projection lens of the theater so that it could resume business as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Gaolan Promotes the Spirit of Wu Xun: Lanzhou Rewards Model Households, Yongjing Old Man Talks About Health</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Lanzhou, 10th (Airmail)] The Yuanhechuan River Basin in Gaolan Dong Township is densely populated and has a beautiful environment. There are more than 600 school-age children, but there is still no central national primary school to date. The county promoted the movement to abolish temples and build schools last year. Zhao Dingjiu and other gentry who are enthusiastic about education raised 500 shi of wheat. After a year of preparation, Changshou Temple, which was dilapidated, has been renovated into a new-style Mulberry Garden Central Elementary School. The school held a completion ceremony on the 5th of this month, and a student achievement exhibition was held at the same time. Song Ke, Director of the Construction Department of Gansu Province, Hao Derun, Magistrate of Gaolan County, and more than 20 local gentry came from more than 40 li away to participate.</p>
<p>This day was the 110th birthday of Mr. Wu Xun. The school chose this day to commemorate it, with a deep meaning. A couplet was hung at the venue: "Proud of wealth and sincere but foolish, do you not see where Shi Chong's wealth and honor are now? Begging for school is a difficult task, please look at</p>
<h3>Free Boat Rides Arranged for Jiangya Victims' Families</h3>
<p>The free boat ride certificates issued by the Relief Group of the Ningbo Fellow Villagers Association's Jiangya Wheel Tragedy Aftermath Committee caused disturbances because the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company had not reserved seats. After negotiations, Li Qingzhang, the head of the company's ticket office, agreed to do everything possible to resolve the matter. Additionally, the Dinghai Zhujianshan Township Office recently telegraphed the Ningbo Fellow Villagers Association, stating that the body of a Ye surname had been recovered by fishermen in that area and requested that the family come to collect it. The Relief Group located the family, Ye Hanxinglin, and issued a relief fund of 1,500 yuan and a free boat ride certificate for them to collect the body.</p>
<h3>Female Corpse Discovered in Nanhui Nicheng Township</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Shanghai Ningbo Fellow Villagers Association's Jiangya Tragedy Aftermath Committee received reports from Gu Zihao of the Dahui News Agency in Nanhui County, Pudong, and Ying Youchun, Sun Jinfu, and Zhu Ada, residing at No. 58 Dong Fahua Town in the city, stating that a female corpse from the Jiangya Wheel had floated to the second Bao area of Nicheng Township in Nanhui County and has now been buried. According to villagers who came to Shanghai, the female corpse wore a red cotton undershirt, a black cheongsam, high-top velvet cotton shoes, and had permed hair. Her nails were painted red, and she appeared to be around twenty years old. Therefore, the association plans to send personnel to exhume and transport the body to Shanghai within the next two days.</p>
<h3>Tianzhang Paper Mill Dispute: Labor and Management Sign Memorandum</h3>
<p>The Tianzhang Paper Mill previously announced a shutdown due to its inability to continue operations, leaving more than 2,000 workers unemployed.

All workers will initially receive two months' wages based on the current month's index, and temporary workers will be paid every 26 days of the month.</p>
<h3>General Manager and Eight Others of Tongyi Trust Company Sued</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] Chen Zhigao, general manager, and eight others of Shanghai Tongyi Trust Company were prosecuted by the District Prosecutor's Office for violating the Banking Law yesterday. Chen, along with company executives Cheng Zhongfan (Assistant Manager), Ying Hejun (Deputy General Manager and Head of Banking Department), Feng Yunliang (Deputy General Manager and Head of Trust Department), Chen Gengyu (Head of General Affairs), Cheng Kefan (Deputy Head of General Affairs), Chen Zhihe (Assistant Manager and Head of Securities Department), Yin Qiyan (Assistant Manager and Head of Accounting), and Liu Huidong (Assistant Manager and Head of Cashier) were responsible for company operations. In 1947, they jointly used the company's organization to continuously violate the Ministry of Finance's Management of Banking Regulations and the Banking Law, directly engaging in commerce, hoarding goods and paper, trading gold, seeking illegal profits, and sharing them. To evade inspection by the supervisory authorities, they created secret accounts and deliberately made false records in various relevant accounts. In August of this year, they were anonymously reported, and the Financial Control Bureau investigated and found the accounts to be false, transferring the case to the District Prosecutor's Office for investigation and prosecution.</p>
<h3>Rice Industry Representatives Explain the Mystery of Rice-for-Cloth Exchange: Cloth Stored in China Textile Corporation Warehouse, Delay in Withdrawal Has Reasons</h3>
<p>After the rice industry's rice-for-cloth exchange case was revealed, all parties paid close attention, especially the fact that the cloth was still stored in the warehouse, leading to questions about how the rice was exchanged. According to a person in charge of the Rice Business Association, in order to suppress rice prices, the authorities decided to implement the rice-for-cloth exchange method. At the beginning of the implementation, Supervisor Jiang convened a meeting of rice industry representatives at the Central Bank on October 4. Mayor Wu and Yang Chuo'an, chairman of the Food Department's Emergency Storage and Purchase Committee, were also present. They instructed to find ways to purchase rice from rice-producing areas and transport it to Shanghai, supplying it at the limited price of 22 yuan per dan. However, the price of rice in various places had risen to more than 30 yuan per dan, and the loss would be compensated by the authorities by allocating 20,000 bolts of cloth at the limited price, which could be transported to other ports for sale. By October 23, the association had barely raised 560,000 yuan, paid for the cloth, and sold more than 30,600 shi of rice. The 20,000 bolts of cloth remained stored in the China Textile Corporation warehouse and were never withdrawn. Because of the precedent of the grain loan case, the rice shops first reported the accounts for purchasing and selling rice. After three accountants carefully audited and confirmed the accuracy, they planned to withdraw and allocate the cloth according to the prescribed ratio. Therefore, the cloth has not been touched at all.</p>
<h3>Yanjing University's Next Semester Tuition: Decision to Pay in Installments</h3>

The school stated that this measure is to facilitate students leaving school and paying fees, in order to respond to the situation at any time.</p>
<h3>Shanghai University Students Returning Home: Makeup Exam Measures Established</h3>
<p>Due to the situation, some students from Shanghai University who lived far away have left school and returned home.

Professors, staff, and workers have also responded by donating clothing, books, and supplies. To thank those who purchase in support, the Welfare Association plans to stamp each item with a special commemorative seal. The College of Arts and Sciences' "Life-Saving" auction concluded yesterday, raising a total of 20,000 yuan over the two days. Most buyers were civil servants, soldiers, and nearby residents, and the college's initial grain storage problem has been solved.</p>

<p>In the Nanshi Football League, the Pan team drew with Huaguang yesterday with a score of one to one. In the first half, Huaguang's pillar, Wu Qixiang, did not play, so the team played erratically.

Within ten minutes, Zhu Jiaheng scored a goal with a header, tying the score at one to one.</p>

<h3>Chen You Cup Basketball Tournament: Huili Wins Big Against Lehe Last Night</h3>
<p>Final Moved to Stadium</p>
<p>The Chen You Cup basketball tournament continued last night with one game each in the A and B groups. In the B group, Nanyang played Nansheng.
