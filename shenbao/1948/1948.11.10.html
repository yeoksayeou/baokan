<p>〔中央社東京九日電〕國際法庭法官，於廿五名甲級戰罪嫌疑犯最後判決書之前半部中，曾三度爲日皇裕仁開脫戰罪之責任，並謂其「素性和平」，反對日德義軍事同盟，而於「滿洲事變」時，亦主張「不擴張政策」又稱：裕仁之反對三國協定，爲三國軸心成立之主要障碍。更因反對日太之統治力量之故，爲人欺騙咸嚇，裕仁批准三國協定時，係爲內大臣木戶幸一所騙。木戶對於三國協定交涉之準展，使裕仁及其信賴之西園寺公望亳無所聞。潘陽事變發生時，裕仁贊同內閣不擴張之主張，因之陸軍方面對「天皇竟爲隨從人員所誘如是，」深爲憤慨。若千領袖，更決定「天皇不宜再談內閣之政策，」並威脅西園寺使之遠離東京，以免軍部對其更增仇恨情緒。裕仁曾數度指斥坂垣征四郞向其歪曲三國協定之眞相，坂坦雖與近衛謀商改變裕仁對於締結軍事同盟之能度，唯亦承認此事甚爲困難·」又法庭認爲裕仁曾多方努力避免日本與美英兩國衝突·</p>

<h3 id="c23">盡人關切的吃飯問題 <a href="#c23" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e23" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">23</a></h3>
<p>目前的吃飯問題，確乎太嚴重了漢口杭州等處，先後發生過搶米風潮，日來上海也發生搶米風潮，兩路局職工且爲了買不到食米，昨日一度總請假，幸市政當局力爲撥借食米，方吿平息。而江西及無錫產米之區，對於採購之米，又在往任意攔截，不許載運出境，達廿餘萬石之鉅·本市當局爲解決民食問題，昨日舉行緊急會一致主張緊急致電行政院立卽電令各省縣迅速放行，運來上海，以解决這個日趨嚴重的民食問題。</p>
<p>誰都知道，排隊軋米，是一般市民最感痛苦之事。因爲今日之下，已不單是貴賤問題，質量問題，而真正已到了有無問題了。凡食口較衆的單位，如機關，學校，工廠，旅館，醫院，酒飯館等，旣不能動員大衆，集體擠購，又非戔之數零星商借所能濟急。除有一部份另覓辦法，領證自往採購外，酒飯館包飯作已紛紛關門停業，或限制時刻，一部份航綫的輪船竟停供伙食，而工廠方面，因爲伙食不繼，亦有人商請職工暫行回鄉了。這種情形，如果任它繼續拖長下去，不趕快予以切實有效的補救，則未來發展，究竟將到什麽地步，實在不容易推測。</p>
<p>本市是早已實施計口配米的了。當局爲維持民食起見，並曾嚴令米商往外採辦食米，來滬供應，以常理論，似乎不應當再發生供應問題。然而無米爲炊，到處多聞此愁苦，其原因何在呢？</p>
<p>第一，配米祗是部份配給，而不是全部配給。依現行法，每人祗許憑瞪配米一斗，其餘一斗，另發准購證，自行價購，於是配米之外，仍不得不許自由米市之存在。其在市面正常時期，來源充裕，供給旣無問題，則多購也罷，少購也罷，甚至如期配給也罷，延期配給也罷，自不會發生何等問題，然而一至到米欠旺，准購米不敷需要時，則以食用不繼之故，仍不免要發生民食恐慌。所以戶口米的發給，縱使照當辦理，絕不短少，，本問題亦不會得到解決·何况十月份的配米又未能如期發售呢？我們認爲；如果要想拿配給來解決民生日用問題，則最低限度的用量，（例如米須兩斗）必須要完全做到，而且無論如何配米是不可短缺的。</p>
<p>第二，遏　政策，加深了民食的恐慌。現往各地採運米糧的，除了官辦機構以外，還有各地的米商，和上海的機關·團體·學校·工廠打號。在食米自由買賣的原则下，喊價自不受任何拘束，因此各方競購，米價也就日漲夜大了。產區米價高，上海的米價自然更高。再加上各產區的禁止出境，來源枯竭市塲上喊價自要愈喊愈高。近來中央和各省市，雖曾三令五申，准許食米自由流通，但是文吿是文吿，事實是事實至省區，小至縣府或各地的部隊，或更小而鄉鎭保長，都有權禁運，檢查·攔截，或沒收，其遵守准予放行時，亦都有權加以各式各樣的限制，如扣云幾成，強收費用，或勒令申請許可等事。這在辦米的人，大都方之鑒鑒，報上亦有不少記載。我們不相信，中央的院部和各省的首長，竟其堂高簾遠，一些也不覺察。假如明知有這些事，是否「已飭准予放行」，或漫發一道通令，便算了事？爲維持政府的威信起見，對於這些公然抗令而擅禁出境的地方官吏，否有其應得之　、中央是否有酌予懲戒的可能？</p>
<p>綜上兩因，可見此屹飯問題之所以形成恐慌者，無非爲供求失調之所致，而本市糧食供求之所以失調，則由於過去各地執行經管政策之不一致，而釀成經濟潮流的惡果·爲今之計，除鼓勵儘量向國內外各地購備米麥外，尤須政府力加保護，以防辦來的糧食中途被刦一空，否則米商就要裹足不前了·民以食爲天，民食問題不能解决』，足以影響地方治安。我們認爲市政當局的解救政策，所謂「疏暢米源，抑平市價」八個字。其重點還在「疎暢來源」。而此來源，除本國產米之區以外，應速籌款分別向暹羅緬甸購運食米來滬，其負責的機關，應以全力來解決民食問題，對於產區及京滬兩地食米的供應情形，都該有一個統盤的計劃。假如各地各自爲政，只謀一城一市民食問題的解決，則此截彼扣，無異於緣木求魚，不特不能解決民食問題，反而使人民的吃飯問題將格外嚴重！</p>

<h3 id="c70">航空新票價按里程計算　每飛一公里金圓六角六 <a href="#c70" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e70" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">70</a></h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕航空運價昨日起調整，中國及中央兩航空公司負責人昨午聯合招待記者公佈新價。以往航空運價之調整係視各航綫旅客經濟狀况之不同而分別核定，例如滬港綫運價向來較滬平滬渝綫爲昂，此次新價則根據實際成本，每飛行一公里金圓六角六分，各綫一律按照里程統一計算。</p>
<p>新價（一）上海至香港綫較原價增加二倍八，（二）上海至重慶綫增加四倍四，（三）上海至蘭州綫增加三倍五，（四）上海至北平綫增加五倍二，但此綫因公教乘客衆多，爲優待起見，以八折計算，（五）上海至南京原價僅十元，如按飛行里程成本計，新價應爲一百八十元，茲以對折九十元收費。（六）貨運每公斤照新價百分之二收費，郵運百分之一，新聞紙類千份之六。據兩公司負責人稱：過去航空運價遠較成本爲低，而政府並無任何方式貼補，公司處境極爲艱困，在此期間，全賴北方貨運收入挹注，現貨運已减少，而汽油價格自去年六月迄今巳由美元二角八分一加侖漲至美金七角餘，故此次不得不根據實際成本調整，俾可繼續飛航。空運爲目前通達全國之唯一交通工具，無論情形如何艱困，決當勉力維持云。茲誌自滬飛出各綫沙發座客機新價於后：</p>
<p>上海至南京九十元，靑島三九五元，天津六一五元，北平六八五元，重慶九八五元，成都一一七〇元，昆明一，三三五元，漢口四八〇元，西安九一五元，蘭州一，二四〇元，肅州一，六四五元，迪化二，三三〇元，福州四一〇元，厦門五四五元，汕頭六七五元，廣州九一〇元，香港一，〇〇〇元，合北四五〇元，曼谷二，一三五元。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕行政院物資供應局爲使各項剩餘物資順利公允分配與公教人員起見，自本日起，決定採行統籌分配辦法。新辦法將以各機關爲單位，由該局根據各機關公教人員儒要，逐批分配所有剩餘物資。詳細辦法，見該局今日所刊於各報之廣吿。</p>
<p>據該局江局長昨語記者：本局於當局開放限價之日，卽十一月一日，所屬門市部及特約承銷商店，仍按限價供應物資，惟是日購物秩序，頓呈空前之紊亂，有兩處特約承銷商店，因擠購者搶購熟門貨而遭搗毀。類此情事，亦足證所發公教人員之購物積點證，不無落入黃牛之手。而弱小之公教人員，旣無時間，亦無力量，難與身高力大者排隊擠購。幾經研討，遂決定改採統籌分配辦法。就剩餘之物資，逐批分配與所有公教人員。分配時改以各機關爲單位，分別向該局門市部及特約承銷商十八單位，直接採辦。如此旣可節省時間，又避排隊擁擠之苦。配售價格與積點證之購買值，均按公敎人員生活指數調整，例如公教人員指數，刻已增加一倍半，則各項物資價格，亦比照八一九限價增加一倍半，積點證每點購買值原爲一角，亦比例增加至二角半。凡此設施，均以維持公教人員之原有購買力爲前提。又舉辦統籌分配前，太局自卽日起，至太週六爲止，先調查各機關現存之積點證數量，各領有積點證之機關，務須於期內造表陳報，以便本局根據分配云。</p>

<p>疏散人口·兩種辦法</p>
<p>宣氏並發表疏散太市無業游民之意見，渠已向市政當局建議實施。渠謂：太市現有人口，以六百萬計，直接生產者不過數十萬人，以數十萬人負祖六百萬人之生活，食之者衆，生之者寡，實不合經濟之原理。故渠建議除產業職工，公教人員，軍警與學生之生活，政府應盡力維持外，其餘之寄生份子，至少有三分之一，婦予疏做出境。渠建議之疏做人口計劃分爲兩種：（一）强迫離滬，（二）自此次調查戶口結果中劃分應予配給者與不必配給者，其未能獲得配給物者，當可逐漸自勸離滬。至在滬之各地難民，宣氏表示上海各界可籌募一筆款項，作爲輸送難民至其他地區之旅費，關於淞滬區實施總體戰之準備工作，宣氏稱渠於上週與吳市長聯合邀集有關各機關首長，作初步之商討，決定成立各委員會，已分別指定負責人員，正進行籌備工作中，</p>

<p>— 本報記者毛樹奎</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕本市各報社記者應浙贛·粵漢·鐵路局之邀，組織訪問團前往訪問，記者團於十月二十二日出發，由浙贛路經杭州。金華·衢州·上饒·鷹潭·南昌·樟樹·株州，而轉入粵漢路，經衡山·衡陽·曲江·英德而抵廣州，再由廣九路至香港，然後循原路返滬，全程三千餘公里，穿越浙·贛·湘·粵·四省，於本月六日返抵本市，歷時半月，茲將沿途見聞所及，向讀者作簡明的報道：</p>
<p>明春一月京穗聯運</p>
<p>東北。華北的戰火，已漸漸增加了華南的重要性，交通部最近曾限令京滬·浙贛·粵漢·三鐵路局，於明年一月完成京穗聯運，無疑的，政府已在重視這條「安定區」內的大動脈了，在目前，從南京坐火車，已可以直達廣州，除了浙贛綫樟樹贛江大橋尙未完成外，其餘都已暢通無阻。　浙贛路在當局勝利之初的「北方第一」政策下，被忽略了，直至去年侯家源局長接任之後，才致力於全綫的趕修工作。</p>
<p>發揮天才飢餓通車</p>
<p>經費雖然困難，材料雖然缺乏，浙贛路的員工却充份發揮了拼湊天才，終於把九百四十九公里的浙贛鐵路拼凑了出來，他們很榮幸地稱自己的傑作爲「饑餓通車」。確然，浙贛路的員工成天在饑餓中，他們工人的薪津，每月還祗有三四十金圓，這戔戔薪津還得分好幾次發給。這次我碰到了不少高級低級員工，他們免不了對當前物價與薪給的脫節耍發一次牢騷。然而他們對本身工作崗位，認識得非常淸楚，他們工作情緒一點兒沒有因爲待遇的菲薄而有絲毫鬆懈。就以克服京穗直達通車的唯一陣碍贛江大橋便橋工程爲例吧：在那裏正有一千多員工日以繼夜地工作着建築贛江使橋，這座便橋工程相當浩大，交通部限令爲爭取時間，必須在五十天內完成全部便橋工程「，很多專家，認爲這個限令未免過於苛刻，然而那天便橋工程處的鄭處長，他却很有把握地對我說：「我們準備在四十五天內完成這個使命，因爲員工都肯幹，沒有人想偷懶，所以進行得快些」。他又說：「我們早一天完工可以多一天使用價值，因爲到明年三月底，江水上漲，便橋便無法使用了，我們在這座便橋上化了很多錢呢」！</p>
<p>車輛增加調度仍難</p>
<p>車皮的缺乏，限制了浙贛路的發展，他們從京滬，津浦等各路要來了些破破爛爛舊車皮，加以整理改裝，勉强凑出了六十多輛客車與六百多輛貨車，他們自己估計，再要增添一倍車皮，浙贛路才能談到自給自足，否則祇能靠債務與饑餓來維持通車。但是說也可憐，浙贛路簡陋的設備已不能再容納更多量的車輛。最近這一二天內大批隴海路的車輛撤退下來，有三百輛要經過浙贛路分配到平漢路，粵漢路去，浙贛路也分配到不少，增加車輛固然可喜，可是給調度帶來了煩惱，因爲浙贛路沒有這麼多的叉道可以安置這批車輛，又不能聽任它們　塞在正道上，祗能有列車到站的時候把它們調到叉道上去，列車過去後再將它拖進正道，空出叉道，以備調車，這樣調來調去，對客車行車時間大受影響，所以近幾日來浙贛路又常在誤點了。</p>

<h3 id="c107">飛島遊記 <a href="#c107" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e107" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">107</a></h3>
<p>— 吳庸</p>
<p>史惠夫脫著的「格列佛遊記」，計分四記：小人國遊記，大人國遊記，飛鳥遊記，馬國遊記。其中似以「小人國遊記」最爲燴灸人口。坊問本子，多割裂節刪，取捨各異，據說第三記卽「飛島遊記」，一般認爲寫得最差，常爲博雅君子所鄙集，而倫教克利斯多福，莊生書店卻別且隻眼，本年特將該記刊爲專冊，附以「社會主義之目的」作者唐納特。莊生所作的跋，以資發揚光大。</p>
<p>該跋大意謂：該書雖是出版於一七二六年，然其內容實爲對今日的社會主義國家而發。二百餘年前的史惠夫脫怎能預見二百餘年後今日的狀况呢？該跋作者認爲：是不難，不足爲奇。何則，有些人能於夢中意識到次日，甚或一月後所發生的事，在奇才如史惠夫脫，其預見的及遠能力比一般人爲強，自不能謂爲絕不可能，云云。</p>
<p>此論非但奇詭，仰且牽強，個人認爲絕無道理。如據一二偶似之點，而謂古人能預見一二百年以後之世事，則史蒂文生所著小說「金銀島」又何嘗不可謂係卽指年前我國某島的藏金案而言？然以書論書，該書的是好書，筆者通讀一過，但覺其奇思奔騰似萬馬，佳句頻仍如連珠。因愛之深，該書竟縈迴於腦際而不去，無以排遣，爰略摘譯其最爲虛無飄渺之談，絕對荒唐不經之論數節於後，以供一粲焉：</p>
<p>作者記虛無大學的虛無教授之言曰：任何國家舉行任何重大會議時，任何與會的人於發表意見，爲自己主張作熟烈之辯議後，於付表決之際應投反對自已主張者的票，洵能如此，則結果必然於民有利云。</p>
<p>該教授又說：於政見紛歧之國，欲謀和衷共濟，其道甚爲簡易，但須就政見不同的二派人士之中，各選其頭角崢嶸之輩百人，依其頭頗大小相同者分爲一百對，各砍去其後腦，然後以砍去部份移置於異見者的頭上；行施是項乎術之際，自須認價將事，馬虎不得，然識能照此辦迭，則必可一勞而永逸，此後便可永遠不再意見紛歧，因爲二半頭腦拼在一起，思想易上正軌，霄論不致過激，至於各個頭腦品質之高下，在此輩都是差不多的。教授如此說。</p>
<p>關於賦稅，教授亦有高見。謂爲與其寓禁於徵，專在人民的惡習邪行上着眼，不如就人們自稱所擁有的仁義道德課以重稅，所有仁義道德數量之多寡，可由各所有人自行估值申報。至於禮義廉恥等項，則在免稅之列，因爲對於這些，人們素不承認爲他人所能擁有，自己亦鮮加重視。</p>
<p>此類奇妙的　論尚多，作者謂爲該校教授神經大都失常，良有以也。該記之所以爲博雅君子所鄙棄，容亦卽基於此歟？</p>
<h3 id="c108">西山的紅葉 <a href="#c108" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e108" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">108</a></h3>
<p>— 仲堅</p>
<p>西風蕭瑟，木葉黃落，秋意巳深了！雖然從北方來到江南，已經一易寒暑，但我仍不能忘懷北地的景物，尤其是故都的秋天，以及點綴在秋天的紅葉。</p>
<p>至今我的一些書本裹還夾藏着片片的紅葉－橢圖形，團扇形，心形，又形－就是我幾度遊山的收穫。從前我愛紅葉，是因爲它象徵秋天唯一的歡愉；而今我珍視紅葉，因爲它能勾起我遨遊的回憶。當我展視這些逐漸褪色的葉片時，舊日的遊踪又一一浮現在眼前。</p>
<p>在北方一片茫茫的大平原上，山景是難見的珍奇，因此西山便成爲北平人遊山的唯一對教。雖然西山是荒漠無青秀之感的邱陵，不能和江南的葱翠羣山相比擬，可是它憑着秋天紅醉的颯林，特別具有一股吸引的魅力。每屆深秋，寒霜數降，楓葉變紅，在陽光的照射下，放出閃爍的紅光，好似簇簇的熾火在山腰山顧燃起。遊人在遠處望見了這些絢麗的色彩，就立刻感到歡欣。</p>
<p>「野外白雲迷古寺，峯前紅葉落青泉。」可借作西山之秋的最好寫照。西山可供遊覽的地方，分在兩處：一是香山靜宜園，一是西山八大處。香山原是西山的一支，在北平城西約四十里，山上有聞風亭，見心齋，韻琴齋，琉璃塔，栖月山莊等勝景，但我最喜愛山　的碧雲寺，幽靜絕俗。寺內有一碑亭豎乾隆十四年「御製重修碧雲寺碑文」刻石，其首句云：「西山佛寺累百，惟碧雲以閎麗著稱，而境亦殊勝」，這並非誇張之語。</p>
<p>碧雲寺的後院有中山紀念堂與總理衣冠塚。中山堂正壁懸一巨幅國父遺像，另有白銅棺一具陳列室隅，據關者稱，棺中空無物，是國父逝世後，蘇聯所贈者，衣冠塚爲城堡式建築，全部用白色大理石築成，碑文係胡漢民題字，建於民國十八年。塚內有石梯，　級而登，折轉三層，然後至頂，在此極目一望，香山風物大半收在眼底，遠處的綠田，近山的紅樹，都興藍天白震相映成趣。遊客至此，未有不心曠神怡者。</p>
<p>西山八大處更在香山以西十餘里，範圍雖較香山爲大，但益增簫索之感。所謂八大處，卽入個廟宇所構成之景：靈光寺，三山菴，香界寺，大悲寺，龍泉寺，責珠洞，秘　　，長安寺。這些廟宇的規模遠不如香山之碧雲，僅有破屋數椽，二三僧人而已。但其殘存的外貌仍可窺見昔日會有一度繁華盛况，只因連年烽火，山地貧　，遂致今日的消歇。其中惟長安寺與秘魔崖之證果寺尚能保持舊日的規模。遊西山者其意固不在廟宇，登高遠眺，平原蕩蕩，紅樹然業，天淸氣爽，　氛盡　矣。</p>
<p>現在又到了「冉冉秋光留不住，滿階紅葉暮」的時節，年來因西山區城屢有戰事，聞今秋上山拾紅葉的人多已裏足不前，昔日西郊公路上滿載紅葉歸來的車水馬龍盛况，已不復見。幾度西風，落葉紛紛，佳遊難再，荒山蕭寺，益增悵惘！</p>

<h3 id="c111">談吃狗肉 <a href="#c111" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e111" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">111</a></h3>
<p>— 老丹</p>
<p>昨閱陳君詒先所寫「狗鞭與龍虱」一文，寫述奇異食物，頗感興趣。吃狗肉與龍虱，多屬奧桂的人。我生長廣東，對於狗肉龍虱，有所同嗜，特把所知的　說幾句。</p>
<p>兩廣人的吃狗肉，是以黑狗爲上品，黃狗花狗次之。狗的重量以五六斤至十斤左右爲佳品，二三十斤重或老狗，卻少人吃。尤其是老狗，沒有人敢輕於嘗試，奧諺有「老狗嫩貓兒，吃死沒人知」的習語。宰狗之法，有用力刺狗喉放血的，有用棒向狗頭擊斃的，有把狗沉在水中溺斃的。有用繩把狗頸吊死的。普通的是用刀刺喉放血與用繩吊的兩種較多。而陳君所說「請客之前數日，將狗後腿懸掛空中，使之餓死，然後烹製」，在我的經驗興所知所聞，兩粵間沒有採取這個方法。因爲狗肉是秋冬間（夏季很少人吃狗）很普通的食品，如果要在殺狗「前數日，將狗後腿懸掛空中，使之餓死」，那就對於狗之營養與脂肪都發生直接的消耗。（殘忍問題不談了。）按理，宰殺動物之前，應給牠好的營養，如廣州信豐雞的餵養，北方的填鴨，就是一例。</p>
<p>兩廣人對於吃狗並不怎樣的視做「珍食」，許多市鎮都公開的煮孰勢應客。尤其是桂省與客籍人的烹狗獨具技法。有些中等人家，常常糾合幾個知友，選擇黑毛小狗來烹製，大嚼一頓，也很尋常。兩廣人對於吃狗肉，如有不速之客來時　，不大招呼共吃。但是，來的人如果有同好的，儘可自己招呼一聲自動參加。粵診有「魚生·狗肉，不請目來」的話。因爲有些人吃了瘋狗或老狗而喪命的，故人們多不敢隨便強邀人去吃，免至招致埋怨，惹出事端。</p>
<p>狗鞭也很尋常，絕不能與鹿鞭·虎鞭等同等珍視·有些烹狗的且把狗鞭棄去不要。若果請客吃狗，而把狗鞭送給首座的獨饗，視做狗宴禮節，在廣東尚無此聞。或者陸榮廷故意作態，來表示狗宴的鄭重而已。至患瘧疾而吃狗肉，往往見　，這就在兩廣的民間最爲普遍的事了。龍虱是零食之一　，等於吃鴨肫肝的普通。</p>

<h3 id="e1">Foundations for Victory in the Xuzhou Campaign Laid; Nationalist Troops Achieve Great Victory on Both Flanks; Over 10,000 Bandit Corpses Northwest of Huangkou <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Xuzhou, 9th] The prelude to the Xuzhou Campaign officially began with the cannon fire at Hanzhuang on the morning of the 8th. That evening, the bandits attacked both flanks of Xuzhou with their main force. Fierce battles broke out on the western flank near Huangkou, 90 li from Xuzhou, and on the eastern flank along both banks of the Grand Canal, 150 li from Xuzhou. The Huanghai Air Force dispatched its aircraft day and night to assist in the battle. According to preliminary battle reports received by noon on the 9th, great victories were achieved on both flanks, especially on the western flank, where the gains were significant. In the vicinity of Huangkou alone, over 10,000 bandit corpses were left behind. The initial victory has the citizens overjoyed. The battle is currently developing in a direction favorable to the Nationalist troops.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Xuzhou, 9th] (1) Chen [Geng]'s 3rd and the Liangguang Columns attacked Tangzhai and Wuji, northwest of Huangkou, on the outskirts of Xuzhou, last night. The fierce battle lasted until the morning of the 9th, leaving over 10,000 corpses behind. They retreated westward, and the Nationalist troops are pursuing and mopping up. (2) A portion of Chen [Yi]'s 7th and the New 8th Columns crossed the Grand Canal southeast of Hanzhuang, north of Xuzhou, last night, harassing the Pangjiadu line. (3) Liu [Bocheng]'s 11th Column is currently harassing Mamuji.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Xuzhou, 9th] The Xuzhou Pacification Headquarters announced: After our Xuzhou Nationalist troops proactively abandoned Zhengzhou, Bianliang, Shangqiu, Donghai, and other places, concentrated their forces, and shortened the battle lines, they lured the enemy to engage in a decisive battle, attracting the bandits to pre-selected battlefields for encirclement and annihilation. For three days, the bandits recklessly stirred up trouble, pouring out from their nests to harass the area. After a fierce counterattack, our troops shattered the enemy's intentions and laid the foundation for victory. It is estimated that on the 8th and 9th, in the area east of Dangshan, west of Xuzhou, Chen Geng's 9th Column, one division, and a portion of the 4th Column were defeated, and two regiments of Chen Yi's Liangguang Column were annihilated. His 3rd and 8th Columns were also severely damaged, with approximately 6,000 killed and wounded. In addition, near the Grand Canal, east of Xuzhou, a certain powerful troop of ours, with the assistance of the air force, defeated Chen Yi's powerful columns, the 2nd, 4th, 6th, 11th, 12th, 13th, and New 7th Columns, achieving brilliant results. In addition to killing and wounding over 10,000 bandits, a large number were captured. Currently, our powerful corps have taken up their predetermined positions, with high morale, and will launch an even greater attack on the bandits in the near future. [Another dispatch] The Pacification Headquarters announced: A certain unit on the Grand Canal line, while its commander was in Xuzhou directing pacification duties, was disturbed by communist spies disguised as Nationalist soldiers, causing some local disturbances. However, because its commander usually treated his subordinates with integrity and was deeply loved by officers and men, it was not affected in any way, and order was immediately restored in the area.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Xuzhou, 9th] Commander-in-Chief Liu Zhi told reporters: The Xuzhou Campaign, following the Yudong Campaign, has already begun. This is a great opportunity in the Central China battlefield for several years to capture and annihilate the main force of the communist bandits. At the start of this campaign, I am particularly pleased to inform all sectors: I am confident in this campaign, and with an unwavering belief in victory and a determination to die, I will command the three armies to annihilate the invading bandits. I hope people from all walks of life will maintain order, unite as one, and assist the Nationalist army, in order to reverse the chaotic situation with this one battle and create a second great victory after the Yudong Campaign.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Xuzhou, 9th] Liu Bocheng's 9th Column, from the Xiayi area south of Dangshan, has been roaming in connection with communist village cadres from the Mangzhong Mountain area for days, engaging in fierce battles with our Xiayi Self-Defense Forces. On the 8th, it mobilized all the bandit troops from various divisions and surrounded all units of our local self-defense forces. A certain unit of the Nationalist army became aware of this, lured the bandits to the vicinity of Dongdian Town, and then launched a sudden large-scale encirclement of the bandits. The fierce battle lasted until 2:00 AM this morning. The bandits, due to excessive casualties, abandoned over 700 corpses and a large amount of supplies and civilian materials, and fled in disorder to the northwest. This battle was the first heavy blow Liu Bocheng's bandits have suffered since their eastward advance.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Bengbu, 9th] The defense deployment of the Huaihe River line is complete. Sun Yuanliang's corps' elite troops are advancing towards Shouxian. Other powerful troops are returning to Bengbu to garrison. A portion of the bandits on the southern section of the Jinpu Railway crossed the road and fled eastward.</p>
<h3 id="e2">Security Along the Puxu Railway Line; Although There Are Minor Damages from Time to Time, Trains Still Run as Usual <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 9th] There are many rumors circulating about places like Xuzhou and Bengbu on the southern section of the Jinpu Railway. According to a spokesman for the Jinpu Railway Bureau: The area along the line between Pukou and Xuzhou is as safe as ever. Although there is minor damage to the tracks from time to time, this has been common for the past three years. Repairs are carried out as soon as the damage occurs, and traffic has not been interrupted for a long time. Although there was some minor damage on the last two nights, it was repaired the next day, and trains are running as usual, maintaining the original schedule. The morale of the people along the line is actually more stable than in Jiangpu. Although Xuzhou is close to the front line, food and other commodity prices are lower than elsewhere. The cunning bandits, intimidated by the strength of the Nationalist army defending the southern section of the Jinpu Railway, have not dared to take reckless action so far, only using bandit spies in the rear to spread rumors in an attempt to disturb the people's morale.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Bengbu, 8th] Two sections of railway tracks between Xiaoxi River and Shimenshan, and between Zhanglaoying and Jiashan, on the Jinpu Railway were destroyed by bandits on the morning of the 8th, interrupting traffic. After emergency repairs, the work was completed in the afternoon.</p>

<h3 id="e11">Sino-Soviet Friendship Weakened Due to Soviet Failure to Fulfill Treaty; Wang Shijie Reports on Diplomacy in Closed Session of Legislative Yuan <a href="#e11" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c11" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">11</a></h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 9th] Foreign Minister Wang Shijie reported to a closed meeting of the Legislative Yuan on the morning of the 9th on the current diplomatic situation, with detailed reports on his experience attending the UN General Assembly, Sino-Soviet relations, atomic energy control, arms reduction, Korea, and related election issues. Mr. Wang stated in his report that the foundation of Sino-Soviet friendship was weakened because the Soviet side failed to fulfill the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship and Alliance. Mr. Wang reiterated the facts listed on June 25 of last year regarding the Soviet side's failure to fulfill the treaty, including the following: (1) After Japan's surrender, the Soviet side would obstruct the Nationalist army from taking over the provinces of Northeast China. (2) Secondly, it would obstruct the government from sending troops and civil officials to Lushun and Dalian to take over power. (3) The Communist bandits seized Japanese military arsenals in Northeast China, and the Soviet side provided facilitation. (4) The Soviet side provided spiritual and material support to the Communist bandits. (5) The Soviet side did not respect the political independence of Outer Mongolia. Regarding atomic energy control, Mr. Wang said: China fully supports the report submitted to the United Nations General Assembly by the special committee on the control of atomic energy composed of eleven countries of the United Nations. He said: China believes that there must be effective international control first, and then good methods can be obtained to deal with the further issues of atomic weapons and control plans. Regarding the issue of arms reduction, the United Nations Charter stipulates arms reduction and the establishment of an international peacekeeping force. Mr. Wang believes that the two must complement each other in order to be effective. Mr. Wang said: Regarding the proposal to reduce the current military strength of the permanent members of the Security Council by one-third, China clearly cannot accept it. Mr. Wang recalled that after Japan's surrender, China originally intended to reduce its wartime armed forces to only one-fifth of its military strength. At the beginning of the implementation of the reduction plan, there was success. If it were not for the rebellion of the domestic communist bandits supported by international communism, which continued and became increasingly rampant, the plan might have been realized. When mentioning the Korean issue, Mr. Wang said: China, together with the United States and the Philippines, has recognized the Korean Provisional Government based on the resolution of the General Assembly. Mr. Wang also said: China believes that the United Nations and its member states should support a principle, that is, the South Korean government produced in accordance with the resolution of the United Nations General Assembly in 1947 should be the legitimate government of Korea. As for the election of United Nations officials, Mr. Wang said: Our country competed for the vice-chairman of the General Assembly, judges of the International Court of Justice, and seats on the Social and Economic Council. All candidates were elected and obtained the most votes. All of this shows that we have maintained a high reputation internationally.</p>

<p>Huang Xuchu Flew Back to Guilin Yesterday Morning</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Guangzhou, 9th] After arriving in Guangzhou, Guangxi Chairman Huang Xuchu and his party discussed the issues of Guangdong-Guangxi joint defense, joint suppression of bandits, and exchange of supplies with Director Song Ziwen and relevant personnel for the past two days. Concrete decisions have been reached. Mr. Huang returned to Guangxi by the original plane yesterday morning. It is said that Guangxi's most urgent need at present is that the number of troops suppressing bandits is insufficient and needs to be supplemented and strengthened. In terms of economy, the exchange of materials is affected due to difficulties in transportation, and the method of exchange settlement needs to be improved urgently. The bandit troubles in the border areas of Guangdong and Guangxi, especially in the areas bordering Guangning, Huaiji, and Yuezhou, are more serious. The bandit suppression troops in the two provinces can cooperate. Among the industries in Guangxi Province that have recovered after the war, only one cement plant has been restored, and the rest are in the planning stage for recovery.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 9th] In order to meet current needs, the government intends to strengthen its internal affairs agencies and transform the peacetime organization into a wartime system. The key points are to simplify the organization and concentrate a few ministries and commissions related to combat and economy, so as to quickly and effectively decide on various important decisions. This plan is currently being drafted by relevant agencies.</p>

When Mr. Weng met with the President on the 9th, he reported this situation to the President. Regarding the President's consultation with Zhang Qun on forming a cabinet, he summoned Mr. Zhang again for a long talk on the 9th. It is said that Mr. Zhang believes that under the current situation, there should be no shirk. However, to form a cabinet, one must have the right way to deal with the current situation. Otherwise, acting lightly may not have satisfactory results. Therefore, as of the 9th, Mr. Zhang has not yet reported to the President with a response to accept the order. Rumors that Mr. Zhang has already agreed are still premature. Furthermore, all parties in Nanjing have high hopes for the news that Mr. Zhang may form a cabinet again, and deeply hope that Mr. Zhang can bring concrete and practical economic and political plans and form a cabinet immediately to save the imminent crisis.</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 9th] International Court judges, in the first half of the final judgment of the 25 Class A war crime suspects, exonerated Emperor Hirohito of war crimes three times, saying he was "peaceful by nature" and opposed the Japanese-German-Italian military alliance, and advocated a "non-expansion policy" during the "Manchurian Incident." It also stated that Hirohito's opposition to the Tripartite Pact was the main obstacle to the establishment of the Axis powers. Furthermore, he was deceived because he opposed the ruling power of Japan and the military, and Hirohito approved the Tripartite Pact because he was deceived by Kido Koichi, the Lord Keeper of the Privy Seal. Kido kept Hirohito and his trusted Kinmochi Saionji completely unaware of the progress of the Tripartite Pact negotiations. When the Mukden Incident occurred, Hirohito supported the cabinet's non-expansion policy, so the army was deeply indignant that "the emperor was induced by attendants in this way." Several leaders even decided that "the emperor should no longer talk about the cabinet's policies," and threatened Saionji to stay away from Tokyo to avoid further increasing the military's hatred towards him. Hirohito repeatedly accused Seishiro Itagaki of distorting the truth of the Tripartite Pact to him. Although Itagaki discussed with Konoe how to change Hirohito's attitude towards concluding a military alliance, he also admitted that this was very difficult. The court also believed that Hirohito made many efforts to avoid conflict between Japan and the United States and Britain.</p>

<h3 id="e23">The Eating Problem That Concerns Everyone <a href="#e23" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c23" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">23</a></h3>
<p>The current eating problem is indeed too serious. In Hankou, Hangzhou and other places, there have been rice-snatching waves one after another. In recent days, rice-snatching waves have also occurred in Shanghai. The employees of the two railway bureaus even took a collective leave of absence yesterday because they could not buy rice. Fortunately, the municipal authorities tried their best to allocate rice, which brought the situation to an end. However, Jiangxi and Wuxi, which are rice-producing areas, are arbitrarily intercepting the purchased rice, preventing it from being transported out of the province, amounting to more than 200,000 shi. In order to solve the food problem for the people, the municipal authorities held an emergency meeting yesterday and unanimously advocated urgently telegraphing the Executive Yuan to immediately order all provinces and counties to quickly release the rice and transport it to Shanghai to solve this increasingly serious food problem.</p>
<p>Everyone knows that queuing to buy rice is the most painful thing for ordinary citizens. Because today, it is no longer just a question of price or quality, but a real question of availability. For units with a large number of mouths to feed, such as government agencies, schools, factories, hotels, and restaurants, it is impossible to mobilize the masses to collectively squeeze and buy, nor can a small amount of piecemeal borrowing solve the urgent need. Except for a portion that seeks other solutions and obtains permits to purchase on their own, restaurants and catering businesses have closed down one after another, or restricted their hours. Some shipping lines have even stopped providing meals, and factories, due to the lack of food supplies, have also discussed with employees to temporarily return to their hometowns. If this situation is allowed to continue for a long time without quick and effective remedies, it is really difficult to predict where the future development will lead.</p>
<p>Our city has long implemented rationing. In order to maintain the food supply for the people, the authorities have also strictly ordered rice merchants to purchase rice from outside and supply it to Shanghai. In theory, it seems that there should be no supply problem anymore. However, the sorrow of "no rice to cook" is heard everywhere. What is the reason?</p>
<p>First, rationing is only a partial allocation, not a complete allocation. According to current regulations, each person is only allowed to receive one dou of rationed rice with a certificate. The remaining one dou requires a purchase permit for self-purchase at market price. Therefore, in addition to the rationed rice, the existence of a free rice market has to be allowed. In normal market conditions, when the supply is sufficient, there is no problem with the supply, so whether one buys more or less, or even whether the ration is distributed on time or delayed, it will not cause any problems. However, once there is a rice shortage and the permitted purchase rice is insufficient, the inability to continue eating will inevitably lead to public panic over food. Therefore, even if the household ration rice is issued as it should be, without any shortage, this problem will not be solved. Moreover, the rationed rice for October has not been sold on time. We believe that if we want to use rationing to solve the problem of people's daily needs, then the minimum amount of usage (for example, two dou of rice) must be fully guaranteed, and no matter what, the rationed rice cannot be in short supply.</p>
<p>Second, the obstruction policy has deepened the public's panic over food. Currently, those who purchase and transport rice from various places include not only government-run institutions, but also rice merchants from various places, as well as Shanghai agencies, organizations, schools, and factories. Under the principle of free buying and selling of rice, bidding is not subject to any restrictions. Therefore, with competition from all parties, rice prices are rising day and night. When rice prices are high in the producing areas, rice prices in Shanghai will naturally be even higher. In addition, the prohibition of exports from various producing areas and the depletion of sources in the market will naturally lead to higher and higher bidding. Recently, the central government and various provinces and cities have repeatedly issued orders allowing the free circulation of rice, but the documents are documents, and the facts are the facts. From the province and region, down to the county government or local troops, or even smaller to the township and village chiefs, all have the right to prohibit transportation, inspect, intercept, or confiscate. When complying with the permission to release, they also have the right to impose various restrictions, such as deducting a certain percentage, forcibly collecting fees, or forcing applications for permits. Those who handle rice are mostly aware of this, and there are many records in the newspapers. We do not believe that the central government's ministries and the heads of various provinces are so far removed that they are unaware of any of this. If it is known that these things are happening, is it enough to "order permission to release" or simply issue a circular and consider the matter settled? In order to maintain the government's prestige, should there be due punishment for these local officials who openly resist orders and arbitrarily prohibit exports? Is there a possibility for the central government to impose appropriate sanctions?</p>
<p>Based on the above two factors, it can be seen that the reason why the rice problem has caused panic is nothing more than the result of an imbalance between supply and demand. The reason why the supply and demand of food in this city is imbalanced is due to the inconsistent implementation of management policies in various places in the past, which has led to the evil consequences of economic trends. The current plan is to not only encourage the purchase and storage of rice and wheat from various places at home and abroad as much as possible, but also require the government to strengthen protection to prevent the purchased food from being robbed en route. Otherwise, rice merchants will hesitate to move forward. Food is the most important thing for the people. If the food problem of the people cannot be solved, it will be enough to affect local security. We believe that the municipal authorities' rescue policy, the so-called "unblocking rice sources, suppressing market prices" eight characters, its focus is still on "unblocking sources." And this source, in addition to the rice-producing areas in our own country, should quickly raise funds to purchase and transport rice from Siam and Burma to Shanghai separately. The responsible agency should make every effort to solve the people's food problem, and should have a comprehensive plan for the supply of food in the producing areas and in Beijing and Shanghai. If each place governs itself and only seeks to solve the food problem of one city and one citizen, then this interception and that deduction is no different from climbing a tree to catch fish. Not only will it not solve the people's food problem, but it will make the people's eating problem even more serious!</p>

<p>[United Press, Paris, 9th] The Security Council held a secret meeting on the 9th, attempting to compel the Arab and Jewish sides to conclude a formal armistice treaty to replace the current stalled Palestinian truce, and to consider the British proposal to order Jewish forces to withdraw from areas occupied in northern Palestine. According to American sources, the United States will oppose the British proposal. United Nations Acting Mediator Bunche, armed with a hastily drafted plan, attended the meeting, hoping to reach a final resolution. Chief Truce Observer US Marine Corps Commander Riley also attended with Bunche. It is estimated that Riley told the Security Council that the progress of the Israeli army has controlled the entire military situation. Bunche and Riley believe that the truce has completed its mission and that strong measures should be taken to promote an armistice treaty and, ultimately, to convene a peace conference. Bunche's plan advocates: (1) The Arab and Jewish sides should promptly conduct negotiations to resolve "major differences" regarding the ceasefire, including the areas recently occupied by Israel in the Negev region and the Galilee region of northern Palestine. (2) This should be followed by a conference aimed at the demobilization of the Arab and Jewish armies, or at least the establishment of a large "no man's land" within Palestine between Israel and its neighbors. (3) Then, negotiations on a permanent solution should begin.</p>
<p>[United Press, Tel Aviv, 9th] The Israeli government today formally requested that United Nations agencies investigate reports of a "significant number" of British troops entering Transjordan, with some of them entering Palestine.</p>

This evidence shows that two batches of materials, including aircraft, tanks, and a large number of firearms, are currently being transported from Libya to Amman, the capital of Transjordan.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 8th] Israeli Foreign Minister Shertok arrived here tonight and will attend the Security Council meeting tomorrow.

<p>[United Press, Paris, 9th] The UN Political Committee resumed its session this morning and immediately passed another section of the joint Chinese, American, British, and French proposal, calling on Greece's northern neighbors to cooperate with Greece to resolve disputes peacefully. The Soviet bloc countries refused to vote. Yugoslav representative Bebler immediately announced that he was unwilling to cooperate with the Balkan Special Committee.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Paris, 8th] The UN Political Committee, on the evening of the 8th, defeated the staunch opposition of the Soviet bloc and determined that Albania, Bulgaria, and Yugoslavia's aid to the Greek guerrillas was endangering world peace. The committee requested that these Soviet satellite states immediately cease their aid to the Greek guerrillas. The Soviet Union, Yugoslavia, and Poland adopted evasive tactics in this 58-nation committee, shouting opposition in what was the most disorderly UN meeting, but ultimately failed to prevent the committee's action. The meeting chairman, Belgian representative Spaak, repeatedly hammered the gavel to maintain order. The committee spent nine hours and fifteen minutes (excluding lunchtime) voting on the proposal chapter by chapter, condemning the Communist attempt to overthrow the Greek government and communize Greece. By the 8th, six chapters of the proposal had been passed, including the main accusations against the three countries: (5) stating that the Balkan Committee found that Albania, Bulgaria, and Yugoslavia were aiding the Greek guerrillas; (2) believing that the continued aid of the three countries to the Greek guerrillas was endangering peace in the Balkans and was clearly inconsistent with the purposes and principles of the UN Charter; and (3) requesting the three countries to immediately cease any form of aid to the Greek guerrillas, including using their territories as bases for preparing military actions. The first chapter passed with 43 votes to 0, with 2 abstentions. The second chapter passed with 47 votes to 0, with 1 abstention. The third chapter passed with 48 votes to 0. After the entire proposal is passed, it will be submitted to the General Assembly, where it is expected to pass with an overwhelming majority.</p>

He also said that the Soviet authorities' decision to arm the police in the Soviet sector with automatic weapons violates the tripartite agreement, but the American troops will take all necessary measures to ensure the safety of the democratically elected West Berlin municipal government.</p>

<p>[United Press, Washington, 8th] The gold in the US Treasury is piling up more and more, with the latest statistics totaling $23,996,169,474.59. In the last twelve months, there has been a frequent increase of about $1,700,000,000. No country has ever had so much gold, and the amount is almost three-fifths of the world's total gold. Although the Soviet Union has the second largest gold reserves, it is only one-tenth of the US. The gold produced in mines is only part of the source; most of it is brought in by foreign countries to pay for goods. The high piles of American gold are causing government officials a major headache, because for every dollar's worth of gold the government acquires, it has to loan out six dollars, resulting in a huge leak. Although officials want the gold to stop flowing in, they are still prepared to buy the remaining gold in the world indefinitely at a price of $35 per ounce.</p>

<h3 id="e62">Two Railways Employees' Go-Slow Disrupts Train Service, Authorities and Union Persuade Them to Resume Normally, Loan of 100 Yuan and 2 Dou of Rice per Person <a href="#e62" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c62" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">62</a></h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Employees of the Shanghai-Nanjing and Shanghai-Hangzhou Railways went on a go-slow because rice prices have recently soared and they are unable to purchase rice. The employees said that their monthly salary is not enough to support an individual for one week and requested a one-month salary loan from the Railway Administration and the issuance of one *shi* of emergency relief rice per person. After this request was made the day before yesterday, it was not resolved smoothly. By 10:00 a.m. yesterday, a comprehensive go-slow had occurred, and traffic on the Shanghai-Nanjing and Shanghai-Hangzhou lines was suspended for five hours. After the senior responsible personnel of the Railway Administration and the union directors worked hard to mediate and persuade, traffic was restored at 2:40 p.m. The Administration agreed to loan each person 100 yuan, to be issued immediately. Two *dou* of food rice will be issued again today, and the remaining eight *dou* will be purchased from the production area and distributed successively. Since 11:00 a.m. yesterday, various passenger trains departing from the city have been delayed by several hours, but today all trains should be able to resume normal service.</p>
<p>The demand of more than 28,000 employees of the two railways for improved treatment has been brewing for many days. The day before yesterday afternoon, workers from Nanjing, Zhenjiang, Wuxi, Qishuyan, Jiaxing, Hangzhou and other places sent representatives to Shanghai to hold an emergency meeting at the general union of the two railways and decided to formally request Director Chen Bochang for a salary loan and the issuance of rice. The Railway Administration expressed sympathy for the workers' demands. The salary loan was promised to be referred to the Ministry of Communications for instructions and handling, but the rice was not immediately approved due to difficulties in procurement. When this news spread to the Machinery Department and the Works Department yesterday morning, the workers' emotions suddenly ran high. By about 10:00 a.m., more than 300 workers from various departments formed a team and rushed to the Railway Administration on Qiujiang Road to petition Director Chen. At the same time, they blocked the trains from running and persuaded the Railway Administration staff to stop working and take the same action. The telephone switchboard was also controlled by the workers, and all telephones inside the Administration and along the line were cut off, leaving only the Nanjing line to facilitate communication between the Administration and the Ministry of Communications. The situation was now very serious, and the North Railway Station was crowded with passengers and workers. Police Chief Wang Zhaohuai, General Affairs Chief Wang Yunxun, Chen Fenke, and the union directors tried to mediate and persuade in different directions. After Director Chen requested instructions from the Ministry of Communications, he accepted the workers' request for rice in principle. However, in terms of procurement, there were practical difficulties, and he promised to issue two *dou* per person today, and the remainder will be purchased and distributed successively. The 100 *jinyuan* was issued on the same day. The workers expressed satisfaction with the Administration's response and immediately resumed train service. The various passenger trains that had been blocked departed one after another, at 2:40 p.m. The various passenger trains that had been blocked at Nanxiang and Longhua also arrived at the station one after another. Traffic on the two lines was interrupted for four hours and forty-five minutes.</p>
<p>Disorder at the North Station, Many Accidents Along the Line</p>
<p>Because the night buses were suspended the day before yesterday due to the census, the station was particularly crowded with passengers yesterday. It also happened that the go-slow occurred, so the order was extremely chaotic. Train No. 81 arrived at Nanxiang at 1:12 p.m. After that, it was unable to move forward due to the blockage of trains in front. The passengers, waiting at the station, swarmed into the train. The passengers in the car could not wait for a long time, causing disturbances and angering the stationmaster. Some of the passengers entered the stationmaster's office and destroyed all the glass windows, signal lights, and other objects. In addition, train No. 58 was traveling to Xiashu, and a man fell off the train. On train No. 5, at Henglin, passengers Tang Guirong and Tang Qiaoxing fell off the train. These unfortunate events were all caused by the fact that the passengers were overloaded due to the temporary inability to control the situation after the go-slow occurred.</p>
<p>Ministry of Communications Dispatches Personnel to Shanghai After Receiving the News</p>
<p>Also, after the Ministry of Communications learned of the go-slow on the two railways, it immediately dispatched Li Bangban, a staff member of the Finance Department, and Li Zubing, the director of the General Affairs Department, to Shanghai to inquire about the situation.</p>

<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Because it is difficult for the employees of various factories in the city to purchase rice and their lives are seriously threatened, their work morale has been affected. Yesterday, the employees of the British tram company and the French tram company went on a go-slow because of this. The work morale of some of the employees of the water, gas, and telephone companies was also not good, but no accidents occurred after persuasion. The Social Affairs Bureau is very concerned about this issue. In addition to trying to dredge the rice supply, during this period of scarcity, if employees do have difficulties, the government will consider the actual situation of each factory and try to subsidize workers' food rice as much as possible to alleviate the urgent need. This method will be implemented first in public utilities. The company's management will discuss with the Social Affairs Bureau the allocation of food rice to temporarily loan each employee one *dou*, which will be issued within days.</p>
<p>Workers in the Machinery Department of the French Tram Company went on a go-slow starting at noon yesterday due to the difficulty of purchasing rice. By 12:30 p.m., some of the workers in the Traffic Department also responded. Trolleybuses on Line 10 and trackless trolleys on Line 17 returned to the Lujiazui factory. After persuasion by the union and the workers' welfare committee, normal operation was restored at 3:30 p.m.</p>

<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Mayor Wu was deeply concerned about the recent surge in meat prices, which has had a great impact on people's livelihoods. He summoned Zhu Zhigao and five or six other responsible persons from the Fresh Meat Industry Association again yesterday afternoon to talk. They said that the high meat prices yesterday should not be the responsibility of the association, because yesterday was Tuesday, which is the day for saving meat as stipulated by the government, and the industry did not have any formal transactions. The fresh meat sold in the farmers' markets was by profiteers. Mayor Wu instructed that starting today, the association should negotiate prices daily, and the retail sales price should not exceed its legal profit. The association can be instructed to be responsible for reporting retailers who raise meat prices. The municipal government will detain them and punish them severely. The responsible person of the Meat Industry Association told Mayor Wu yesterday that the negotiated price for pork today should not exceed 21 yuan per catty. Mayor Wu solemnly stated to reporters yesterday when he met them that he would pay attention to the meat market today, and if he still finds unreasonable prices, he is prepared to take positive action and arrest a few to be dealt with according to law.</p>
<h3 id="e70">New Airfares Calculated by Mileage; 6.6 Gold Yuan Per Kilometer <a href="#e70" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c70" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">70</a></h3>
<p>[Report from our Newspaper] Airfares were adjusted starting yesterday. Representatives from China and Central Aviation Corporations jointly met with reporters yesterday afternoon to announce the new prices. In the past, adjustments to airfares were determined separately based on the economic conditions of each route. For example, the Shanghai-Hong Kong route was traditionally more expensive than the Shanghai-Beiping (Beijing) or Shanghai-Chongqing routes. This new pricing, however, is based on actual costs: 6.6 Gold Yuan per kilometer flown, with all routes calculated uniformly based on mileage.</p>
<p>The new prices: (1) Shanghai to Hong Kong increases by 2.8 times the original price; (2) Shanghai to Chongqing increases by 4.4 times; (3) Shanghai to Lanzhou increases by 3.5 times; (4) Shanghai to Beiping increases by 5.2 times, but due to the large number of public and educational sector passengers on this route, a 20% discount will be applied as a preferential measure; (5) Shanghai to Nanjing was originally only 10 yuan, but based on the cost per kilometer flown, the new price should be 180 yuan. However, it will be charged at half price, 90 yuan. (6) Freight is charged at 2% of the new price per kilogram, postal services at 1%, and newspapers at 6 per thousand copies. According to the representatives of the two companies, past airfares were far lower than costs, and the government did not provide any subsidies. The companies faced extremely difficult situations. During this period, they relied entirely on freight revenue from the north. Now, freight revenue has decreased, and the price of gasoline has risen from US$0.28 per gallon to over US$0.70 since June of last year. Therefore, this adjustment had to be made based on actual costs to ensure continued flight operations. Air transport is currently the only means of reaching all parts of the country, and the companies will strive to maintain it, no matter how difficult the circumstances. Listed below are the new prices for the sofa-seat passenger planes flying from Shanghai to various destinations:</p>
<p>Shanghai to Nanjing: 90 yuan; Qingdao: 395 yuan; Tianjin: 615 yuan; Beiping: 685 yuan; Chongqing: 985 yuan; Chengdu: 1,170 yuan; Kunming: 1,335 yuan; Hankou: 480 yuan; Xi'an: 915 yuan; Lanzhou: 1,240 yuan; Suzhou (Jiuquan): 1,645 yuan; Dihua (Ürümqi): 2,330 yuan; Fuzhou: 410 yuan; Xiamen: 545 yuan; Shantou: 675 yuan; Guangzhou: 910 yuan; Hong Kong: 1,000 yuan; Hubei (Xiangyang): 450 yuan; Bangkok: 2,135 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e71">Supply Bureau Improves Method for Benefiting Public and Educational Personnel in Selling Goods; Decides on Unified Distribution by Institution <a href="#e71" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c71" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">71</a></h3>
<p>[Report from our Newspaper] In order to ensure the smooth and fair distribution of surplus materials to public and educational personnel, the Executive Yuan's Materials Supply Bureau has decided to implement a unified distribution method starting today. The new method will be based on individual institutions. The Bureau will allocate all surplus materials in batches based on the needs of the public and educational personnel in each institution. Detailed information can be found in the advertisement published by the Bureau in today's newspapers.</p>
<p>Bureau Director Jiang told reporters yesterday that since the authorities opened price limits on November 1st, the Bureau's affiliated stores and contracted sales shops have continued to supply materials at limited prices. However, the shopping order on that day was unprecedentedly chaotic, and two contracted sales shops were vandalized due to shoppers抢购热门货 (fighting to buy popular goods). These events also demonstrate that the shopping point certificates issued to public and educational personnel have inevitably fallen into the hands of scalpers. Moreover, weaker public and educational personnel have neither the time nor the strength to queue and compete with taller and stronger individuals. After several discussions, it was decided to adopt a unified distribution method. Surplus materials will be distributed in batches to all public and educational personnel. The distribution will be conducted by individual institutions, which will directly purchase from the Bureau's affiliated stores and 18 contracted sales units. This will save time and avoid the hardship of queuing and crowding. The distribution price and the purchase value of the point certificates will be adjusted according to the cost-of-living index for public and educational personnel. For example, if the public and educational personnel index has increased by 1.5 times, the prices of various materials will also increase by 1.5 times compared to the August 19th price limit. The purchase value of each point on the point certificate was originally one jiao, and it will also be proportionally increased to two and a half jiao. All of these measures are aimed at maintaining the original purchasing power of public and educational personnel. Before implementing the unified distribution, the Bureau will conduct a survey of the current number of point certificates held by each institution from today until Saturday. All institutions that have received point certificates must submit a report within this period so that the Bureau can allocate them accordingly.</p>
<h3 id="e72">Commander Xuan Tiewu's Remarks After Returning to Shanghai <a href="#e72" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c72" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">72</a></h3>
<p>After going to Nanjing to report to the President and discuss matters, Songhu Garrison Commander Xuan Tiewu met with reporters from the Central News Agency yesterday afternoon to discuss current military and economic issues. He stated that during his trip to Nanjing, he reported on the recent price situation in Shanghai and the plan to implement total war in the Songhu area. The President instructed that the price issue should be resolved reasonably and urged active preparation for the implementation of total war.</p>
<p>Rice Distribution to Households Will Not Be Interrupted</p>
<p>Recently, there have been repeated incidents of rice and vegetable抢米 (snatching) in the city, and Xuan has been paying close attention to this. He stated that rice distribution to households will continue and will not be interrupted. It is inevitable that malicious individuals are hiding among those who are creating rumors and inciting the recent incidents of抢米. The Garrison Command will formally announce on the 10th that the act of抢米 is strictly prohibited, and those who create rumors and incite unrest will be severely punished without leniency.</p>
<p>Evacuating the Population: Two Methods</p>
<p>Xuan also expressed his views on evacuating unemployed vagrants from the city. He has suggested this to the municipal authorities. He stated that Shanghai currently has a population of six million, but only a few hundred thousand are directly productive. It is not economically sound for a few hundred thousand people to support the lives of six million. Therefore, he suggested that the government should do its best to maintain the lives of industrial workers, public and educational personnel, military police, and students. As for the remaining parasitic elements, at least one-third should be evacuated out of the city. He suggested two plans for evacuating the population: (1) Compulsory departure from Shanghai; (2) Distinguish between those who should be rationed and those who do not need to be rationed based on the results of this household survey. Those who fail to obtain rations will gradually be encouraged to leave Shanghai on their own accord. Regarding refugees from other regions in Shanghai, Xuan stated that various sectors of Shanghai can raise funds to cover the travel expenses of transporting refugees to other regions. Regarding the preparations for implementing total war in the Songhu area, Xuan stated that he and Mayor Wu jointly invited the heads of relevant agencies last week for preliminary discussions. It was decided to establish various committees and assign responsible personnel to carry out the preparatory work.</p>

<p>[Shanghai Report] Representatives from the General Labor Union, including Shui Xiangyun, Zhou Xuexiang, Liang Yongzhang, Fang Rusheng, Ye Xianggao, and Qiu Changjiang, visited Director Wu and Deputy Director Zhao of the Social Affairs Bureau yesterday afternoon to inquire about wage and rationing issues for workers in the city. (1) There were many rumors regarding the restoration of cost-of-living index-based wages. Director Wu stated responsibly that the index for the first half of November will be announced on the 15th. Some workers in the city are paid based on the previous month's index, and how to base November's salary is still under consideration. Due to the rapidly changing prices, the General Labor Union requested that wages be calculated based on the current index. (2) The original ration of daily necessities for workers included five items: rice, oil, sugar, coal briquettes, and cloth. The General Labor Union requested that the rationing scope be expanded as much as possible to include items such as cigarettes and soap, and that they be issued as soon as possible. Director Wu stated that he would do his best to stabilize the lives of workers. Due to the fact that the ration certificates for November are still being printed, they may not be issued before the 15th. The General Labor Union requested that the compilation of the cost-of-living index for the first half of November not be based on limited prices before workers receive the rations, but should be calculated based on market prices. (3) Workers in various factories are experiencing panic due to the difficulty of purchasing rice, which is affecting their work morale. They hoped that the government would do its best to assist them. Director Wu stated that he would do his best within the possible scope.</p>

(3) The method of exchanging goods for rice is actively being implemented. Several British and American businessmen in the city visited the Mayor and expressed their willingness to assist with goods. Mayor Wu was very pleased and is currently in contact with the US Aid Committee to proceed. (4) The Mayor summoned the responsible persons of the Rice Industry Association, Wan Molin and Qu Zhenhua, yesterday and instructed them to urge all rice shops and rice merchants to find ways to purchase rice from the producing areas in order to solve the rice shortage. It was also stipulated that starting from February 14th, each rice shop must sell 4 dan of rice daily, and each rice merchant must sell 20 dan of rice daily.

<p>[Report from our Newspaper] The American merchant Fu Lai Shipping Company's China mail ship, originally scheduled to sail to the United States from Shanghai with cargo, changed its plan because the United States ordered 25,000 tons of rice from Siam for aid to China but lacked ships for transportation. Seeing the severe rice shortage in the city, the company's ship ceased its voyage to the United States and sailed directly to Bangkok.

<h3 id="e88">China Textile Adopts Quotation and Verification Sales Method; Cotton Cloth Prices Drop Sharply <a href="#e88" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c88" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">88</a></h3>
<p>The cloth market has been impacted by the tightening of credit, resulting in a sudden reversal of fortunes. Cloth merchants are dismantling their businesses at a high interest rate of 120 yuan per thousand. Starting yesterday, the Textile Construction Company changed its pricing method. All purchasers need to fill in their own prices, which will be verified and allocated by the Textile Construction Company. Prices that meet the standards set by the Textile Construction Company will be allocated, otherwise, they will not be sold. This is intended to equalize allocated prices with actual market prices and control market fluctuations based on the quantity sold. Merchants, unable to withstand high-interest exploitation, are trying to sell off their stock. Outside the trading floor, fine cloth initially shouted a price of 330 yuan, but then declined all the way, with the lowest price near noon being 260 yuan. Many transactions were made at 270 yuan at noon. Si Junzi Yuan Biji also fell below the 3 million mark, with the final price shouted at 290 yuan, a sharp drop of about one-third from the highest price the previous day. The cloth shops have not yet reopened, and people's hearts are still unsettled.</p>
<p>China Textile Distribution</p>
<p>[Shanghai Report] The China Textile Construction Company conducted a quotation and verification sale of cotton cloth yesterday, resulting in six types being offered. The types and opening prices are as follows: Si Junzi Yuan Biji 300 yuan, Mei Hua Tu 1014 Printed Biji 320 yuan (limited to retail stores). Hongguang Jing Yuan Yarn Straight Gongduan 300 yuan (limited to retail stores and umbrella industry). Deputy Brand 29-yard half Biji Fabric 230 yuan (limited to dyeing factories). Longtou B 12-pound Fine Cloth 270 yuan (limited to retail stores and dyeing factories). Child Car A Bleached Poplin 300 yuan (limited to underwear factories). A total of 4,610 bolts were sold, totaling 1,357,800 yuan. A total of 199 customers were approved for purchase, including 21 manufacturers who purchased 660 bolts and 178 cloth merchants who purchased 3,950 bolts.</p>
<h3 id="e89">Limited Price Allocation for the Seventh and Eighth Periods to be Expedited <a href="#e89" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c89" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">89</a></h3>
<p>The Import Quota Allocation Office of the Import Management Committee is actively processing the allocation of import quotas for industrial raw materials for the seventh and eighth periods. It is announced that the allocation will be completed by the end of this month. The allocated amounts for each industry will be handed over to the respective industrial trade associations for their member manufacturers to negotiate the allocation among themselves, and the detailed allocation of each manufacturer will be reported to the Import Management Committee for record. Each manufacturer can then submit import documents based on the quota allocated by the trade association for approval by the Import Management Committee. It is understood that this process will be expedited to ensure that domestic manufacturers can obtain raw material supplies promptly. However, due to the different monthly capital turnover situations of each manufacturer, the trade associations need to conduct business surveys for each factory in the season to determine the quota allocation, which is time-consuming. Therefore, it is not as fast as ideally expected. To date, some manufacturers who have been allocated quotas for the sixth period have not yet applied. It is also clarified that once the Import Management Committee receives the detailed allocation of quotas for each factory from the trade associations, it will immediately approve the applications from manufacturers who have completed all the required procedures. The rumor that the review will only begin after all manufacturers have completed their applications is a misunderstanding.</p>
<h3 id="e90">Credit Becomes Tighter, Capital Flight to the South Intensifies <a href="#e90" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c90" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">90</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, credit became tighter as money shops decided to suspend lending to customers and began recalling outstanding debts immediately. The demand from various industries was extremely high, making capital turnover in the market even more difficult than before. The highest overnight interest rate in the unofficial market reached 70 yuan per thousand, with the common rate around 50 yuan per thousand, equivalent to a monthly interest rate of 1.5 to 2.1 yuan. It is heard that the authorities have decided to sell off goods to absorb surplus capital, which will inevitably intensify the credit crunch.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the amount of capital fleeing from this city to Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Guangdong has been substantial recently, estimated at over 100 million yuan per day, which is also a significant reason for the credit crunch.</p>
<p>Tea Market Stagnation</p>
<p>Yesterday, the tea market for foreign firms remained stagnant as buyers and sellers persisted in their respective positions, preventing transactions from taking place. As for the domestic tea market, which had just begun to recover, shops on Dajie Street continued to show interest, frequently contemplating involvement. However, holders of goods continued to cite the depletion of market inventory and the fourfold increase in shipping costs, further strengthening their determination to sell, causing the previously smoothly negotiated various grades to suddenly turn hesitant. The market trend quickly became quiet, and it is difficult to expect sales to resume smoothly in the near future under these circumstances.</p>
<h3 id="e91">Sugar Prices Plunge <a href="#e91" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c91" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">91</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market experienced an unusually tight credit situation, with shockingly high overnight interest rates. Holders of goods could not bear the burden and rushed to settle their positions. Moreover, rumors spread that the authorities would sell off Taiwan Sugar, causing panic among the public and a wave of selling in the market. With supply exceeding demand, spot traders seized the opportunity to cut prices, causing the market to plummet even more drastically. Average prices across the board fell by 50 to 60 yuan. Grade 4-5 white sugar opened at 450 yuan but found no buyers. Some holders, eager to realize cash, instantly dropped the price to the 400 yuan level. The market remained heavily skewed towards selling, and the closing price further declined by 10 to 20 yuan, with other grades following suit.</p>
<h3 id="e92">Silk Price Fluctuations <a href="#e92" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c92" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">92</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the silk market experienced a sharp decline in prices due to the extremely tight credit situation, leading to a sharp decrease in purchases from various groups and widespread unease. Asking prices steadily declined, and the more they declined, the more supply increased. Holders rushed to realize cash, and short sellers seized the opportunity to cut prices, making the market situation extremely weak. Grade 120 Tianqiao silk opened at 20,000 yuan with no buyers, then gradually declined, closing down 4,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Export silk for foreign firms saw both scarce supply and demand, making it impossible for foreign firms to operate. Transactions were sluggish. The domestic market saw an unusually tight credit situation, high overnight interest rates, and a lack of new purchases. Silk weavers' purchasing power also declined, making people cautious and fearful, and the market situation became weak. Grade D 7/8 evenness was offered at 18,000 yuan, but there were no buyers, and only a few transactions took place at 16,500 to 17,000 yuan. Premium small lots were transacted sporadically at 15,000 to 16,000 yuan, with no offers for the rest.</p>
<p>Silk raw materials experienced a decline in prices, causing a shift in sentiment towards pessimism and a sudden halt in purchases from customer groups. Local streets were filled with desperate sales to realize cash, causing the market situation to decline steadily. Silk weavers were dumping orders, resulting in ample supply, and the closing market became increasingly unsustainable. Strong silk fabrics saw offering prices plummet as low as 6,000 to 7,000 yuan due to widespread selling, and no other transactions took place.</p>
<h3 id="e93">Rice, Grain, Oilcake Decline; Cooking Oil Resumes Free Trade <a href="#e93" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c93" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">93</a></h3>
<p>The amount of rice arriving in the market was very limited. 105 shi of Xian rice arrived at the South Market, trading at 290 yuan. There were no arrivals at the North Market, and there were only asking prices. Due to the extremely limited number of sellers and the strong demand from citizens, rice merchants' asking prices remained high despite the tight credit situation. Bai Jing rice was offered at 700 yuan, with some asking as high as 800 yuan, and Xian rice was offered at 600 yuan, but these were all sporadic transactions.</p>
<p>Flour</p>
<p>The asking prices for Lao Che and Bing Chuan brands were initially 250 yuan, then 240 yuan, weaker than the previous afternoon. Bran was 190 yuan, then 160 yuan.</p>
<p>Miscellaneous Grains</p>
<p>Due to the credit crunch, goods owners sought to liquidate their stock for cash, and prices started to fall across the board. Soybeans fell by 20 to 30 yuan, Poyangzi beans were 230 yuan, corn and red sorghum each fell by 30 yuan, sesame seeds fell by 30 to 40 yuan, and raw peanuts fell by 20%.</p>
<p>Cooking Oil</p>
<p>Price negotiation was cancelled, and free trade resumed. Due to the tight credit situation, goods owners were selling off their stock, resulting in a high volume of transactions. Soybean oil fell to 900 yuan, rapeseed oil was 850 yuan, raw oil was 1,250 yuan, and small-batch sesame oil was 1,000 yuan, each falling by 150 yuan compared to the previous day. Soybean cake prices plunged by 50%.</p>
<h3 id="e94">Commercial Briefs <a href="#e94" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c94" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">94</a></h3>
<p>The asking prices for industrial raw materials continued to rise, but they remained relatively stable compared to other commodity prices. Yue Pai alkali was offered at 5,000 yuan, triangular glycerin rose to 1,500 yuan, Kao Jiao opened at 16,000 yuan, and Sidi Ling opened at 2,500 yuan. Transactions remained scarce, and goods owners remained bullish.</p>
<p>Firecrackers from Ningbo were still priced at 7 fen per two, and goods from Liuyang were blocked, keeping prices stable. Although tin foil prices in the producing areas rose, goods from individual brokers flooded the market. Due to the credit crunch, transactions were stagnant, and market prices were similar to those of the previous Saturday, with no changes in retail prices.</p>
<p>Gallnuts from the producing areas frequently reported price increases, with sales in Tianjin temporarily suspended. Sales on Taitai Street were also not very active, but the market trend was still upwards along with general commodity prices. The asking price for gallnuts reached 550 yuan, while there were no transactions or asking prices for Du Bei.</p>

<h3 id="e95">A Glimpse of a 3,000-Kilometer Journey Through Zhejiang, Jiangxi, Hunan, and Guangdong <a href="#e95" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c95" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">95</a></h3>
<p>— Our Correspondent Mao Shukai</p>
<p>[Our Dispatch] In response to an invitation from the Zhejiang-Jiangxi and Guangdong-Hankou Railway Bureaus, reporters from various newspapers in the city organized a visiting group to visit the railway lines. The reporter group departed on October 22, passing through Hangzhou, Jinhua, Quzhou, Shangrao, Yingtan, Nanchang, Zhangshu, and Zhuzhou via the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway, and then entering the Guangdong-Hankou Railway, passing through Hengshan, Hengyang, Qujiang, and Yingde to reach Guangzhou. They then returned to Shanghai via the Kowloon-Canton Railway, following the original route. The entire journey was over 3,000 kilometers, crossing the four provinces of Zhejiang, Jiangxi, Hunan, and Guangdong. They arrived back in the city on the 6th of this month, lasting half a month. Here is a brief report to the readers on what they saw and heard along the way:</p>
<p>Beijing-Guangzhou Through Transport in January Next Spring</p>
<p>The flames of war in Northeast and North China have gradually increased the importance of South China. The Ministry of Communications recently instructed the Beijing-Shanghai, Zhejiang-Jiangxi, and Guangdong-Hankou Railway Bureaus to complete the Beijing-Guangzhou through transport by January next year. Undoubtedly, the government is paying attention to this major artery within the "safe zone." Currently, it is possible to travel directly from Nanjing to Guangzhou by train. Except for the unfinished Zhangshu Ganjiang Bridge on the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Line, the rest is unimpeded. The Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway was neglected at the beginning of the authorities' "North First" policy. It was not until Director Hou Jiayuan took office last year that he devoted himself to the full-line rush repair work.</p>
<p>Exerting Genius, Starving to Open to Traffic</p>
<p>Although funds were difficult and materials were scarce, the employees of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway fully exerted their patching genius and finally pieced together the 949-kilometer Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway. They were very proud to call their masterpiece "Starving to Open to Traffic." Indeed, the employees of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway were constantly starving. The workers' salaries were only 30 to 40 gold yuan per month, and this meager salary was distributed in several installments. This time, I met many high-level and low-level employees. They could not help but complain about the disconnect between current prices and wages. However, they had a very clear understanding of their own jobs, and their work enthusiasm was not slackened in the slightest due to the meager treatment. Take the Ganjiang Bridge temporary bridge project, the only obstacle to overcoming the Beijing-Guangzhou direct through train, as an example: There, more than 1,000 employees were working day and night to build the Ganjiang Bridge. This temporary bridge project is quite large. The Ministry of Communications limited the time to 50 days to complete the entire temporary bridge project. Many experts believed that this limit was too harsh. However, Director Zheng of the Temporary Bridge Project Office said to me with great certainty: "We are prepared to complete this mission within 45 days, because the employees are all willing to work hard, and no one wants to be lazy, so it is progressing faster." He also said: "We can complete the work one day earlier and have one more day of use value, because by the end of March next year, the river will rise, and the temporary bridge will be unusable. We have spent a lot of money on this temporary bridge!"</p>
<p>Increase in Vehicles, Scheduling Still Difficult</p>
<p>The lack of rolling stock limited the development of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway. They transferred some dilapidated old rolling stock from the Beijing-Shanghai, Tianjin-Pukou and other lines, refurbished them, and barely put together more than 60 passenger cars and more than 600 freight cars. They estimated that if they added double the number of rolling stock, the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway could be self-sufficient, otherwise they could only rely on debt and starvation to maintain traffic. But it is also pitiful to say that the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway's simple equipment can no longer accommodate more vehicles. Recently, a large number of rolling stock from the Longhai Railway were withdrawn, and 300 vehicles had to pass through the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway and be distributed to the Ping-Han and Guangdong-Hankou Railways. The Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway was also allocated a lot. It is certainly gratifying to increase the number of rolling stock, but it has brought troubles to scheduling, because the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway does not have so many forks to accommodate these vehicles, and they cannot be allowed to be blocked on the main track. They can only be transferred to the forks when the train arrives at the station, and then dragged back to the main track after the train has passed, leaving the forks empty for shunting. This kind of shunting greatly affects the travel time of passenger trains, so the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway has often been delayed in recent days.</p>

<p>[Our Dispatch from Wuxi, 8th] In order to ensure the security of the urban area and prevent criminals from hiding, the City Defense Headquarters conducted a surprise spot check on the population and inspected the national identity cards of pedestrians on each street. At the same time, a traffic control meeting will be held on the 12th to discuss how to control various means of transportation and how to use them when necessary.</p>
<h3 id="e97">Lu'an Builds Security Stockade <a href="#e97" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c97" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">97</a></h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch from Lu'an, 5th] The county government, under the order of the Pacification District, convened an enlarged meeting of all circles in order to consolidate the city defense and build security stockades, and invited Major Wang of the stationed army to attend and give instructions. It was decided on the spot to establish a Security Stockade Construction Committee to be responsible for handling the matter. The source of funds will be raised from wealthy households in the county, and public officials at all levels will also have to donate in order to avoid general apportionment.</p>

<p>[Our Dispatch from Zhenjiang, 8th] Xia Qi, the construction auditor general dispatched by the Sino-US Economic Cooperation General Administration, arrived in Zhenjiang from Shanghai on the 6th to inspect the canal west dike blocking recovery and the Yangtze River culvert project undertaken by the Huaihe River Engineering Bureau and the Yangtze River Water Conservancy Engineering Bureau. On the 7th, accompanied by Qian Zhenrong, Director of the Construction Department, Xia took a boat to Liuxu and Shaobo to inspect the progress of the two locks and the Yangtze River embankment blocking recovery project. Xia expressed great satisfaction. He expressed particular sympathy for the Chinese rural areas in distress and expressed his willingness to do his best to assist in improving the Chinese rural areas with American aid. He took the express train to Shanghai on the 7th night, and will fly back to the United States recently to report on his duties.</p>
<h3 id="e99">Edge of Huai Coal Mine, Jiulonggang Coal Piles Up Like a Mountain, Can Relieve Coal Shortage in Beijing and Shanghai <a href="#e99" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c99" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">99</a></h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch from Jiulonggang, 6th] Our reporter visited the Huainan Coal Mine for several days and witnessed 20,000 employees working quietly day and night under the tense situation when the Communists were surrounding. At present, the three mines of Jiulonggang, Datong, and Bagongshan produce 4,000 tons of coal per day, but in today's serious coal shortage in Beijing and Shanghai, due to the lack of rolling stock on the Huainan Railway, coal piles up like a mountain in each mine, with more than 70,000 tons of coal in storage and cannot be transported out. If the government provides transportation support and assistance, it will be of great help in relieving the coal shortage in Beijing and Shanghai. The war is spreading to the edge of the Huai Coal Mine, and Jiulonggang is building fortifications, with 70% of the funding borne by the mine. There are also troops stationed in the mining area for defense. However, if unfortunately the mining area is used for combat against the bandits, the situation of the Huai Coal Mine, which has been operating for nearly 20 years, will be unimaginable. The Mine and Railway Bureaus are looking forward to the timely arrival of the US$3.5 million aid loan (all equipment) in March next year. According to the plan, the daily coal production will be 15,000 tons in two years. However, the funds required for the equipment installation will be twice the amount of the US aid loan, which is still a major problem. The 118-kilometer railway from Hefei to Yuxi is being relaid, and the Hefei-Chaohu section has already begun track laying. It may be open to traffic within the Lunar New Year. If the economy is not a problem, the entire line can be opened by the Dragon Boat Festival next year. After the US aid arrives, the number of vehicles is expected to increase. At present, the daily passenger transport on the Shuida, Yongbang, and Shuihe sections, which are open to traffic, is 9,000 people, and the biggest difficulty is the lack of rolling stock. The Tianjia'an Power Plant generates 9,200 KW, which is supplied to various large and small electric motors. A 6,000 KW generator is being installed, which will not only provide power for itself, but also for industries near the mining area and along the railway line. People generally have unlimited hope for the beautiful prospects between the Yangtze and Huai Rivers. (Our Correspondent Bao Baiping)</p>

<p>Taixing</p>
<p>[Our Dispatch] Lu Jianming, director of the Tai and Yu Tax Collection Office of the Jiangyin National Taxation Bureau of Finance, took the opportunity to secretly purchase tax certificates and tax stamps when adjusting the liquor tax this time, filled out rural area receipts, filled in the wrong month and date, and hoped to cover up his crimes and enrich his own pocket. The amount of fraud reached as high as 60,000 gold yuan. It is now heard that Mr. Zhou, a local gentry, believes that during the period of suppressing the rebellion, when the national treasury was unstable, he dared to collude and embezzle, and exchanged food with bandits, which was enough to undermine national policy, and has secretly submitted the matter to the authorities to request a strict investigation.</p>
<p>Kunshan</p>
<p>[Our Dispatch] The county authorities have recently decided to collect a special self-defense donation, using 4,425 shi of rice as the standard, and have ordered the township offices to comply.</p>
<p>Wujin</p>
<p>[Our Dispatch] The city defense commander of this county has resigned from Zhou Jinan for more than a month, but has not yet been replaced. It has recently been decided that Zhou Wenxin, the captain of the 6th Traffic Police Corps stationed in the county, will take over. He took office on the 8th.</p>
<p>Wuxi</p>
<p>[Our Dispatch] A portion of the materials previously investigated and registered have been reviewed and completed, totaling 158 items. On the 7th, the command post ordered the county to distribute or sell them fairly.</p>
<p>Jurong</p>
<p>[Our Dispatch] Huangmei Township, the 15th Bao, Zhoujiabian, Nanshe, Chenxiang and other villages, jointly had a regiment of a certain unit. On the night of the 4th, they were ordered to be transferred to Dangtu. Unexpectedly, when they were about to leave, some unarmed soldiers went to the ground and robbed more than 40 shi of rice from each household. Although the villagers knelt and begged for mercy, they could not escape.</p>
<p>Lu'an</p>
<p>[Our Dispatch] The County Senate held its 9th session of the first term. More than 60 senators attended. Speaker Pan Jiesan resigned to the General Assembly with determination because of his domestic affairs and the busy assembly affairs. Vice Speaker Yao Zhesheng also resigned to the General Assembly because he was old and sick and physically weak. After the proposal was submitted, the senators unanimously retained Speaker Pan, who was prudent and steady. However, Vice Speaker Yao was suffering from old age and illness and should be recuperated. After it was passed, Shen Xianhui was elected as Vice Speaker with 54 votes, and the General Assembly closed satisfactorily.</p>

<h3 id="e107">A Trip to Flying Island <a href="#e107" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c107" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">107</a></h3>
<p>— Wu Yong</p>
<p>Swift's "Gulliver's Travels" is divided into four books: A Voyage to Lilliput, A Voyage to Brobdingnag, A Voyage to Laputa, and A Voyage to the Country of the Houyhnhnms. Among them, "A Voyage to Lilliput" seems to be the most popular. The books sold in the market are mostly fragmented and abridged, with different choices. It is said that the third book, "A Voyage to Laputa," is generally considered to be the worst written and is often despised by the erudite gentlemen. However, the Christopher Johnson bookstore in London has a different perspective. This year, it specially published this book as a special volume, with an afterword by Donald Johnson, the author of "The Purpose of Socialism," to promote it.</p>
<p>The afterword means roughly: Although the book was published in 1726, its content is actually aimed at today's socialist countries. How could Swift foresee the situation of today, two hundred years later? The author of the afterword believes: It is not difficult and not surprising. Because some people can be aware of what will happen the next day, or even a month later, in their dreams. For geniuses like Swift, his ability to foresee and reach far is stronger than that of ordinary people, so it cannot be said to be absolutely impossible, etc.</p>
<p>This argument is not only strange, but also far-fetched. Personally, I think it is absolutely unreasonable. If, according to one or two similar points, it is said that the ancients could foresee the events of one or two hundred years later, then how can Stevenson's novel "Treasure Island" not be said to refer to the treasure hiding case on a certain island in our country years ago? However, judging the book as a book, the book is a good book. After reading it through, I only feel that its strange thoughts are rushing like ten thousand horses, and its beautiful sentences are frequent like a string of beads. Because of my deep love for it, the book lingers in my mind and does not leave. Unable to dispel it, I slightly excerpted and translated a few sections of its most ethereal talk and absolutely absurd arguments below for your amusement:</p>
<p>The author recorded the words of the nihilistic professor of the Nihilistic University: When any country holds any major conference, anyone who attends the conference, after expressing their opinions and making a fierce debate for their own propositions, should vote against those who oppose their own propositions when it comes to voting. If they can really do this, the result will inevitably be beneficial to the people.</p>
<p>The professor also said: In a country with divergent political views, the way to seek harmony and cooperation is very simple, but it is necessary to select 100 of the most prominent people from the two factions with different political views, divide them into 100 pairs according to the same head size, cut off the back of their heads, and then transfer the cut-off part to the heads of those with different views. When performing this technique, it is necessary to take it seriously and not be careless. However, if you can follow this plan, you can get it done once and for all, and you will never have divergent opinions again, because the two half-brains are put together, and the thinking is easy to get on the right track, and the discussion will not be too extreme. As for the quality of each brain, it is about the same for these people. The professor said so.</p>
<p>Regarding taxation, the professor also has high opinions. He said that instead of focusing on the evil habits of the people, it is better to levy heavy taxes on the benevolence and morality that people claim to possess. The amount of benevolence and morality can be estimated and declared by each owner. As for etiquette, righteousness, integrity, and shame, they are exempt from taxation, because people have never admitted that others can possess these, and they rarely pay attention to themselves.</p>
<p>There are many more of this kind of wonderful arguments. The author said that the professors of the school are mostly mentally disordered, which is very reasonable. The reason why this book is despised by the erudite gentlemen may also be based on this?</p>
<h3 id="e108">The Red Leaves of the Western Hills <a href="#e108" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c108" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">108</a></h3>
<p>— Zhongjian</p>
<p>The west wind is bleak, the leaves are yellow and falling, and autumn is already deep! Although I have come from the North to Jiangnan, and a year has already passed, I still cannot forget the scenery of the North, especially the autumn of the old capital, and the red leaves that adorn the autumn.</p>
<p>Even now, some of my books still have pieces of red leaves tucked inside – elliptical, fan-shaped, heart-shaped, and other shapes – the harvest from my several mountain excursions. In the past, I loved red leaves because they symbolized the only joy of autumn; now I cherish red leaves because they evoke memories of my travels. When I display these gradually fading leaves, the old trails reappear one by one before my eyes.</p>
<p>On the vast plains of the North, mountain scenery is a rare treasure, so the Western Hills have become the only destination for people in Beiping to visit. Although the Western Hills are barren and lack the verdant beauty of the hills and cannot be compared with the lush mountains of Jiangnan, it relies on the intoxicating red forests of autumn, especially with an appealing charm. Every late autumn, after several frosts, the maple leaves turn red, and under the sunlight, they emit a sparkling red light, like clusters of blazing fire burning on the mountainside. When tourists see these gorgeous colors from a distance, they immediately feel happy.</p>
<p>"White clouds obscure ancient temples in the wilderness, red leaves fall into the green spring before the peaks." This can be used as the best portrayal of autumn in the Western Hills. The Western Hills can be divided into two places for sightseeing: one is Jingyi Garden in Fragrant Hills, and the other is the Eight Great Sites in the Western Hills. Fragrant Hills was originally a branch of the Western Hills, about forty miles west of Beiping City. There are scenic spots such as Listening to the Wind Pavilion, Seeing the Heart Study, Rhyme Qin Study, Glazed Pagoda, and Qixia Villa on the mountain, but I like Biyun Temple in the mountains most, which is quiet and unique. In the temple, there is a stone pavilion erected with a carved stone from the fourteenth year of Qianlong's "Imperial System of Rebuilding Biyun Temple Inscription", the first sentence of which says: "There are hundreds of Buddhist temples in the Western Hills, but Biyun is famous for its grand beauty, and its environment is also unique," which is not an exaggeration.</p>
<p>In the backyard of Biyun Temple, there is the Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hall and the Mausoleum of Sun Yat-sen's clothing and hat. A huge portrait of the Father of the Nation hangs on the front wall of Sun Yat-sen Hall, and there is also a white copper coffin in the corner of the exhibition hall. According to the relevant sources, the coffin is empty and was given by the Soviet Union after the death of the Father of the Nation. The Mausoleum of Clothing and Hat is a castle-style building, all built of white marble, and the inscription is by Hu Hanmin, built in the eighteenth year of the Republic of China. There are stone steps in the tomb, climbing up the steps, turning three layers, and then reaching the top. From here, you can see most of the scenery of Fragrant Hills. The green fields in the distance and the red trees near the mountains are in harmony with the blue sky and white clouds. Tourists who come here will feel refreshed.</p>
<p>The Eight Great Sites in the Western Hills are more than ten miles west of Fragrant Hills. Although the scope is larger than Fragrant Hills, it adds to the feeling of desolation. The so-called Eight Great Sites are the scenery composed of individual temples: Lingguang Temple, Sanshan Temple, Xiangjie Temple, Dabeisi Temple, Longquan Temple, Zhuzhu Cave, Mimoya, and Chang'an Temple. The scale of these temples is far inferior to that of Biyun in Fragrant Hills, with only a few broken houses and two or three monks. However, the remaining appearance can still give a glimpse of the former prosperity. Only Chang'an Temple and Zhengguo Temple in Mimoya can maintain their former scale. Those who visit the Western Hills are not interested in the temples. Ascending to a high place and looking into the distance, the plains are vast, the red trees are burning, the sky is clear, and the atmosphere is completely gone.</p>
<p>Now it is the season of "The fleeting autumn light cannot be kept, and the steps are full of red leaves in the evening." In recent years, due to frequent wars in the Western Hills area, it is said that people who go to the mountain to pick red leaves this autumn have stopped. The grand occasion of cars and horses on the western suburbs highway full of red leaves returning in the past is no longer seen. After several west winds, fallen leaves are flying, good trips are difficult to repeat, and the desolate mountains and temples add to the sorrow!</p>

<p>For three years, I have dreamed of the defense of the river, and the future ahead is blocked and long. Campaigns are gradually distressing as the people's strength is exhausted, and the only thing I see to replenish is busy paperwork. The banana charm has not been settled and the journey is stopped, and the loom is completely empty and the professional skills are abandoned. I am ashamed to live in the countryside without making any contributions, and I am worried that the big officials are busy in their old age.</p>

<h3 id="e111">On Eating Dog Meat <a href="#e111" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c111" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">111</a></h3>
<p>— Lao Dan</p>
<p>Yesterday, I read Chen Jun's "Dog Penis and Dragon Lice", which described strange foods and aroused my interest. Eating dog meat and dragon lice mostly belongs to the Austronesian people. I grew up in Guangdong, and I have a similar preference for dog meat and dragon lice, so I would like to say a few words about what I know.</p>
<p>For people in Guangdong and Guangxi who eat dog meat, black dogs are the best, followed by yellow dogs and patterned dogs. Dogs weighing about five to ten pounds are the best, while those weighing twenty or thirty pounds or old dogs are rarely eaten. Especially old dogs, no one dares to try them lightly. There is an Austronesian saying: "Old dogs and young cats, if you eat them to death, no one will know." There are methods of slaughtering dogs, such as forcefully stabbing the dog's throat to bleed it, knocking the dog's head to death with a stick, and drowning the dog in water. Some use a rope to hang the dog's neck to death. The common methods are stabbing the throat with a knife to bleed and hanging with a rope. However, Chen Jun said, "Several days before inviting guests, hang the dog's hind legs in the air to starve it to death, and then cook it." In my experience and what I have heard, there is no such method in Guangdong and Guangxi. Because dog meat is a very common food in autumn and winter (few people eat dogs in summer), if you want to "hang the dog's hind legs in the air to starve it to death several days before killing the dog", it will directly consume the dog's nutrition and fat. (The issue of cruelty is not discussed.) In principle, animals should be given good nutrition before slaughtering them, such as the feeding of XinFeng chicken in Guangzhou and the stuffing of ducks in the north.</p>
<p>People in Guangdong and Guangxi do not regard eating dogs as a "treasure". Many cities and towns openly cook and sell it to guests. Especially in Guangxi Province and among the Hakka people, the method of cooking dogs is unique. Some middle-class families often gather a few friends, choose a small black dog to cook, and have a big meal, which is very common. People in Guangdong and Guangxi do not often invite people to eat together when unexpected guests come. However, if the person who comes has the same preference, he can invite himself and participate automatically. There is a saying in Cantonese: "Raw fish and dog meat, don't invite your eyes to come." Because some people have lost their lives by eating mad dogs or old dogs, people often dare not force others to eat, so as not to cause complaints and cause trouble.</p>
<p>Dog penises are also very common and should never be regarded as the same as deer penises or tiger penises. Some dog cooks even discard the dog penis. If you invite guests to eat dog meat and give the dog penis to the head seat to enjoy alone as a dog banquet etiquette, there is no such thing in Guangdong. Perhaps Lu Rongting deliberately pretended to show the solemnity of the dog banquet. As for eating dog meat for malaria, it is often seen, which is the most common thing among the people of Guangdong and Guangxi. Dragon lice are one of the snacks, equivalent to the ordinary eating of duck gizzards.</p>
