<h3>孫科與立院委會召集人　交換當前政局意見　王世杰亦參加報告外交</h3>
<p>〔本報南京五目電〕翁內閣請辭聲中，各方對於當前政局均極電視，立法院長孫科四日曾宴請立院各委員會之召集人，就當前政局交換意見，五日下午七時立院各委員會召集人復聯合邀宴孫氏，經由孫氏之提議，並請王世杰參加，席間王氏就出席聯合國大會經過作非正式報吿，並由各立委發表意見，王氏能度誠懇，對外交全局分析甚詳，迄九時許始散。</p>
<p>〔本報南京五日電〕翁內閣之辭意仍甚堅，惟五日仍到院辦公，處理各項要公，其全體閣員之總辭，亦仍俟翁氏之動靜爲定，總統對翁氏仍懇切挽留中。</p>
<p>〔本報南京五日電〕財政部長王雲五五日已恢復辦公，上午九時許到部處理公務，迄午始離去，王氏辭職後，自一日起卽未到部辦公，已歷四日，其辭意仍甚堅決，但因感於總統多次懇切慰留婉勸後，鑒於目前時局之嚴重，應共度時艱，在請辭朱獲准前，已允勉爲其難，到部辦公，以免部務中斷，惟據王氏左右表示，渠仍繼續請辭。</p>
<p>〔本報南京五日電〕東北九省三市立委，五日於立院例會時，全日開會檢討東北局勢之演變及責任問題，並根據會中意見發表聲明。首稱：長春·錦州·潘陽之陷落，其實際意義等於說明聯合國從未贏得和平，甚至亦未曾贏得勝利。第二次世界大戰迄仍在繼續發展中。聲明抨擊蘇聯「實際是軸心國家的伙伴，而在今日更是軸心國家的繼承者」。聲明中復縷述政府當局自簽訂中蘇友好條約以迄接收東北，開始戡亂剿匪，至東北全部淪亡，在外交·內政·經濟·軍學各方面措施之失誤，加以嚴厲指責，希望政府能接受失敗之敎訓，並以東北人民之立塲，正吿「自由世界　國政治家及人民，尤其美國政治家及人民」，謂四千萬人民「又進入第二個九一八的黑暗時代」。聲明繼宣稱：「我們人民爲爭民族自由，所以對一切的外來侵略勢力，不惜流盡最後一滴鮮血，同時我們也必須爲爭取政治的民主，才願貢獻出我們所有的力量，我們悲痛我們家鄉的淪喪，但是我們更悲憤無從發揮我們人民的力量」。最後要求「特權階級必須退却，人民力量必須前進」，以「求得民族的自由，政治的民主，而最後求得所有陷於黑暗恐怖中的人民之解放」。</p>
<h3>對杜魯門連任美總統　翁院長發表談話　中美爲世界和平努力之意向一致</h3>
<p>〔本報南京五日電〕行政院翁院長，聞杜魯門總統當選通任後，五日發表談話如次：美國大選，杜魯門總統當選連任，此項消息，在中國聞悉，甚爲欣慰，杜魯門總統向極重視世界和平，此次當選後，仍申明爲世界和平前途而努力，此與中國人民之意向完全一致。中國希望確得國內及國際之眞實和平，從前對極權國家之抵抗，目前對共匪擾亂之戡戰，不畏艱難，辛苦從事，其目的惟在克服擾亂之原因，奠立安定和平之基礎，此時共匪武力更爲擴張，其威脅世界和平之全局更爲重大。杜魯門總統向極熟誠援華，深望美國在杜魯門總統領導之下，瞭解中國局面對於世界和乎影響甚大，對於吾國力量積極援助，俾吾國政府之正當努力早日加高成功之份量。</p>
<h3>吳鐵城發表文告</h3>
<p>美將予我更有效援助</p>
<p>〔中央社南京五日電〕國民黨中央黨部果秘書長鐵城，今以中國國民外交協會（按吳氏係該會主席）之名義，發表文吿稱：杜魯門總統今連任下四年度美國總統，中國人民特向美國人民及杜魯門總統表示慶賀之忱。吳氏稱：杜魯門總統業已繼承故羅斯福總統在第二次世界大戰時所制定之民主黨政策，對我國爲自由與獨立之奮鬥，予以援助，渠將予美國忠實盟國之我國以更大與更有效之援助，以及一更佳世界之新希望，當屬無疑。</p>
<h3>蒲立德仍將來華</h3>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓四日電〕美前駐蘇大使浦立德四日談稱：此次大選結果並不改變渠擬於九日飛赴中國直接調査美國援華計劃事，蒲氏繼稱：渠希望可於「聖誕節左右」由華返美。</p>
<h3>南華早報社論　警告反動份子</h3>
<p>〔中央社香港五日電〕此間權威性之南華早報，刻再度警吿逃匿香港之左派人士曁各類反政府份子稱：香港政府與中國友好，故不允居於此間者作任何反抗中國政府之行爲，而諸君之與共黨採同一陣綫，終非善策。</p>
<h3>美遠東海軍　學習假想戰　十七日起舉行三日</h3>
<p>〔合衆社東京五日電〕美空軍發言人五日稱：美國遠東軍及海軍第三十八機動部隊，所屬飛機軍艦，十一月十七日起將在菲列賓，中國東海及日本南西兩方海面舉行假想戰三日，駐日第五空軍及駐冲繩第一空軍大隊將參加演習。海軍將由金德爾海軍少將指揮，空軍則由丁伯雷准將指揮。</p>
<h3>杜魯門競選獲勝　美仍將繼續援華　民主共和兩黨均認我爲東方砥柱　華府遠東專家分析大局</h3>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓四日電〕此間遠東專家四日分析杜魯門之競選勝利時大都認爲美國將來仍將援華。甚多專家之結論如下：卽使共和黨獲勝，最後結局亦然相同。彼等稱：至於援助之數額，則有待於遠東及歐洲今後之發展。雖表示應繼續或加緊援華之議負爲數尚少，然杜魯門已保證反對任何中國之共產政府。目前遠東局勢危急，民主黨議員絕無較共和黨議員缺乏認識之表示。卽使民主黨缺乏援華之主動力，則此次重返回國會者尚有援華急先鋒周以德·福爾敦·伏里斯及勃里奇斯等共和黨健將。前時共和黨議員常攻擊民主黨之遠東政策，若干民主黨人士認爲彼等初非灤愛遠東，此舉不過係一種政治手段而已。由於國軍之撤出東北，大多數美人咸怵然而驚，分外認淸共產主義主宰中國下之危險·美人一方面恐共黨之席捲中國，一方面又關切整個遠東，蓋民主共和兩黨之遠東政策，均認中國爲東方之中流砥柱。周以德三日吿合衆社稱，東北淪陷乃第二個「珠珍港事變」，而係美國本身安全之「最嚴重危機」。其他遠東專家相信，下屆國會開會初期，響應周氏之論調者必風起雲湧，國會內共和民主兩黨要人均將傾聽此一呼聲。蓋二次大戰前美國遠東政策錯誤百出，殷鑑不遠，記憶尚新也。一般相信，白魯姆將重長衆院外交委員會，證以其以後經歷，白氏可望與總統及國務卿步伐一致，雖一般常稱馬歇爾反對進一步援華，然消息靈通方面宣稱，馬氏之反對不在援助之原則，而在處理援助之方法。彼等稱：如馬氏在位不去，渠將認淸全部遠東國家之命運坸應於中國之命運，而將主張强力援助。彼等又稱：美國若繼續援華，恐將規定做援希成例，派遺軍事及經濟顧問援助中國官員推動工作。消息靈通人士表示，無論如何，杜魯門之當選絕不致减少中國之獲援希望，蓋民主黨政府迄無願容忍共產黨支配中國及東方之跡象。彼等稱：反之，一般有理由相信美國協助遠東國家復興及民主化之決意，將以進一步援華表達之。彼等稱局勢之基本因素無變易，杜魯門之勝利亦未加以更改。</p>
<h3>營口撤退　難苦壯觀</h3>
<p>〔中央社南京五日電〕海總消息：此次經營口轉進之遼西潘陽國軍，在我海軍船隻支援下，已完成一艱苦壯觀之敵前撤退偉績。按自遼河口入口燈　進入營口市區水道，全程約十六浬餘，河身爲一彎曲狹淺之水這，最狹處僅四分之一浬寬，最淺處水深僅達十英尺左右，平日航行已至感不易，加以航行標誌全經破壤，匪軍又於水道設置各稱障礙多處，僅第八號標竿處卽沉船達三艘以上，經我海軍畫夜工作，始於廿六日順利打通，廿九日我海軍開始協助南事國軍集中，以猛烈火力壓制遼　兩岸匪軍，至本月一日，我全部大軍集中完畢後，卽於當日正午開始登輸，至四日我陸上國軍已全部安全撤退完畢。</p>
<h3>白吉爾上將在滬宣佈　美不放棄青島基地　可能派遣陸戰隊來滬保僑</h3>
<p>〔聯合社本市訊〕美國西太平洋艦隊司令白吉爾上將由靑島來滬，作短期訪問，昨招待記者稱：美國西太平洋艦隊祇須有裨於美國利益及中國人民，並無放棄靑島基地之意。但此並非指示其有意或預料將積極參加中國內戰，亦非指示其準備撤退在華美僑及其他外僑。西太平洋艦隊係應一中國政府之請駐在中國，支持援一助中國之平民機關，支持美國外一交人員，並保護美國人民之生命一財產。如本國及他國僑民有撤退一之必要，該艦隊自當基於人道主一義，履行其傳統的任務，並儘量援助他國人民。如經請救，亦可撤退中國政界要人，一如其撤退任何人士。至於第三十八機動部隊適在此緊急時期抵華，係屬偶然。目前局勢不致令機動部隊留註中國海面過久。西太平洋艦隻不願爲中國軍隊載運軍火或給養至戰區，以免參加中國內戰之嫌，並須特別小心，勿作偏袒任何一方之形式。在華數千美僑之安全，恃乎美國能保守中立，海軍如違反中立，必將危及其安全。或問美海軍是否將增加駐滬人員，並派陸戰除來此，白氏答稱：此爲一可能之事，但純係保護性質，其目的在保護美僑，並顧及其他友邦之人民。陸戰隊具有國際警察之特殊地位，故按照國際公法，可在外國海岸登陸，並不視作戰爭行爲。白氏預測，美國總統選舉之結果，海軍政策不致有何變更，美海軍並不參加中國內戰，僅爲保護僑民及支持美國政府之文職代表。至於海軍人員及其眷屬之撤退，不成問題，可以駐在靑島之任何一艦撤退其全部，故海軍地位最爲安全。</p>
<h3>蘇皖區內美僑　奉令考慮撤退</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕京滬美國使領當局，昨日同時勸吿居留蘇皖境內之美僑，如無居留境內之迫切需要，不妨就正常交通工具仍馬具備之時，考慮撤退。</p>
<p>該項撤僑勸告，本市係由駐滬美總領事館發給業已註册之本市美僑三〇〇八人。南京方面，則由美大使館發給居留於南京浦口區內之美僑，佔計約在千人以上。</p>
<p>該項撤僑勸吿有云：「由華北軍事情勢之開展而觀，戰事可能繼續向南蔓延，致上海對外之交通，亦可能中斷。同時，冬令轉瞬卽屆，糧食及燃料供源日形枯竭，留居上海及其附近之人士，可能遭逢各種艱困。職是之故，茲特建議，閣下如無居留境內之迫切需要，應在正常交通工具仍屬具備之時，考慮撤退。美總領事葛柏德」。</p>
<h3>津市民紛紛南下</h3>
<p>〔本報天津五日電〕此間外僑尚無大批撤退跡象，國人則似更較不沉着，離津者紛紛奔走交通工具，飛機，輸船擁擠不堪，招商局已暫停登記，四日·五日金剛·元培二輪駛滬，因爭先上船，秩序紊亂。</p>
<h3>杜魯門報告　援外救濟計劃</h3>
<p>對京配米情况表不滿</p>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓四日電〕社魯門總統四日報吿稱：中國未能完全履行其於一九四八年四月至六月間接獲美國救濟物資之協議。政府在經濟合作總署署長所擬就之報吿中稱，但中國顯未故意不顧救濟協議之基本原則，所以未能履行協議者，由於「政治經濟軍事情勢之起伏」。該報吿爲救濟工作之第四次報吿，歷述關於對中國，希臘，義大利，吳國及特港等三億五千萬美元救濟計劃在一九四八年第二季中之工作。該報吿指出救濟中國計劃中有下列各項錯誤：（一）食物配給計劃在南京中輟。（二）在各項計劃中付款之遷延·（三）在上海不能以現實之市價訂定物價。該報吿繼稱：「中國政府之記錄從未完全正確與合時」，幷謂在大體上而言，救濟中國計劃「堪稱成功」。該報吿復謂中國官員「俸給過低不無沮喪」，杜魯門總統警吿稱：美援必須由美人在當地密切監察，渠幷强調稱，在予中國以有效援助方法「諸多困難」。鑒於若干議員及其他人士現正要求激增援華，杜氏此言被認爲特別重要。</p>
<h3>熱河主席談省政</h3>
<p>〔本報承德五日電〕承德國軍於四日擊潰承南流匪後，人心乃定。五日晨物價轉穩。記者頃訪孫主席渡，就目前省政有所叩詢．孫氏沉靜異常，渠稱：關外戰局重心仍在遼西，承德在短期內決無被攻跡象，省政決以最大努力配合軍事，故各項主要工作，如採煤，建鄉，徵兵，組訓等均在積極進行，務期從動蕩中求表現，以配合戡亂軍事。</p>

<h3>經濟再改革後的二三事</h3>
<p>經濟情態，最爲複雜。國策一經變更，其由原來的狀態，而趨於變更後的新水準時，在相當時期內，必有一度的紛擾與混亂，這是事實上所不能避免的。要求這過渡期間的縮短，與紛亂程度的减輕，自非當機立斷，迅速採取若干必要與合理的措施不爲功。</p>
<p>就此次財經改革的補充方案而言，如限制出境辦法的立時取消，一部份核本定價的迅予決定，與調整工資的洽商準備，這些工作，都不失爲臨機應急的合宜處置。然而市塲紛亂的現象，迄今未見好轉，尤其是市價亂喊，漫無準則，而一般單帮，黃牛黨，及特殊人物，復乘機紛紛搶購，致增加了市塲的混亂，與一　民衆惶恐的心理。這在主管機關實不能不負相當的實任。</p>
<p>因爲補充辦法，明明規定：凡紗·有·油·　·煤·鹽等物品，均應由中央核本定價，而這幾項物品，無疑地又與民生日用關係最密切。如果甚項價格迅予核定，通飭遵行，則不但以後的生活標準與經管方針，可獲得明白的指示，卽其他一般議價與自由市塲，亦不患無準繩可資參照。所惜中央在此緊急時機忙於人事，竟沒有理會到此，而據地方機關透露，卽連這項補充方案的照例文章，至今亦尚且沒有轉到。無怪各地紛紛擾擾，沒有一個切實的解決辦法了。</p>
<p>在主管院部的意思，或以爲其他重要物品，卽民生日用品及工業原料，旣已授權地方，自行管理，卽不應由中央單獨負實。殊不知各種物價，是具有相互的連帶關係的。例如：紗布價格沒有核定，則其主要原料之棉花價格，地方便無從下手；又煤球價格，當然應根據煤價的，今煤價還未經中央核定，又敎地方如何擬議？我們說這些話，並不是爲各地方政府卸責，現在有好許多縣市，連以前阻物出境的禁令，都沒有遵照中央意旨切實廢除，甚至檢査，搜括，變本加厲，更談不到甚麼核價與議價，其實也太不像樣！然而政令因何如此緩慢？上級機關又因何任其自然而不加督導？這在上級主管機關，總不能說一無干係吧。</p>
<p>除了物價以外，最切要的問他，自無過於工資與公敎人員待遇的調整了。公敎人員的待遇，已經三日政務會議議決，照十月份增加一倍半，這問題的解決，總算還相當地快，却又完全漢視了當前的事實。因爲目前物價，至少要比從前漲起四五倍，乃至七八倍，就拿政府自己所經營的郵政來說吧，一經調整，便狂跳上二十倍，何以公敎人員的待遇，只許增加一倍半？又十月底的發行總額，已達到十六億元左右，除了六億元左右爲收兌金鈔而發的以外，實已增發至五倍，照這種情形看來，將來物價的趨勢如何，不難想像，何以仍作硬性規定，不肯恢復指數計算的辦法？所以這個問題，在政府或以爲已經解決，其實還是不能解決的。</p>
<p>至於冬工資如何調整，要比這個問題更形嚴重了。因爲照中央的意思，是只可拿生活指數作參考，却不能拿來作標準，而且這種參考資料，仍舊要保守秘密，不許公開發表的。我們也知這：生活指數，並不是計算工資的唯一標準，在從前指數計薪時，確也曾有過不少非難的議論。但在沒有其他更合理的標準可貴採用時，這項統計，至少還是各方面堪以共信共守的尺度，中央旣許拿指數來作參考，可知他們亦未嘗不承認其具有合理的價值。顯何以不許拿來作為計算標準？又何以不許按期公開發表？難道他們認爲：工資問題，是和公敎人員的待遇，同樣單純，可以一紙命令解決得了的嗎？現在本市的商會，工業會，和總工會三個團體，已聯名電請正式恢復指數，作為調整工資的標準，我們希望中央從速考慮適宜辦法，以消弭方興未艾的許多工潮。</p>
<p>隨着　補九方案而來，急待解決的問題尚多，如外匯的如何處理，配給的如何維持，以及行莊利率如何變更，生產事業貸款如何開放，進出口貿易如何進行等，這都是中央主管機關所莫可拖岩的。其在地方，自然也有不少工作尚待整理，例如：封存貨物如何清理發還？憑證購貸的辦法今後應否繼續存在？除了隱匿金鈔不報以外，應否再用隨便吿密的辦法苛擾工商業者？尚有一部份的核木定價貨物，尚未正式決定，應如何從速完成手續？這都是現在急待解決的問題。而其中最爲大衆所關切，辦理亦最爲因難的，莫如如何執行議價這一點，就是核本定價以後，如何使這些定價，切實生效，不再發生黑市。這是新方案成敗之所繫，亦是各地方最吃重的工作。大家在飽嘗硬性限價的痛苦以後，自然不希望舊事重提，回復到過去嚴格管制的狀况；但議而不限，與不議同，限而先議，是明明已顧到生產成本，顧到商人利益，並不强迫任何方面遭受到不合理的損失，因此，一般商人應卽自動地互相約東，切實遵守議價，不要再事專圖厚利，自害害人了吧！</p>

<h3>皖南清剿工作</h3>
<p>— 本報記者　黃行天</p>
<p>〔本報屯漢二日訊〕皖南二十三縣這個山巒起伏的丘陵地帶，是適宜於匪的成長和發展的，尤其是皖浙，皖贛，皖蘇邊境那些地方，地形複雜，在行政上又是三不管的地區，加以往昔皖南文風特盛，人才輩出，以致民風重文輕武，住民都有一種文弱的性格。由於這種種天然環境和有利條件，皖南一直是匪息特電的地方·記者此次訪問皖南，特就所知，略作報道。</p>
<p>這是第三代</p>
<p>現在的皖匪已是第三代了。最初在民國廿三年江西勦共的時候，有方志敏率部七八萬人闖入皖南盤據，第二次是葉挺的「新四軍」重返皖南，建立根據地，發展至五六萬人。現在，這第三代的匪，是「新四軍」的舊屬，接受二次的敎訓，而逐漸成長起來的。現在的番號，是「蘇浙皖贛人民解放軍皖南支隊」可以作戰的步隊約有四千人。但據官方報告，其兵力約為一一千五百餘人，有重機槍一，輕機卅餘，短槍六十餘，步檐一千七百餘支，其司令為熊兆仁，副司令劉奎，林浩，政委胡明，參謀長楊明</p>
<p>「新四軍」遺留下來的少數總郃，潛伏民間，暗中活動，未為當地政府及地方紳耆注意。到民國卅六年春間，他們開始蠢動，招收土匪，裹脅流氓，進而奪取鄉保武力，建立山區根據地，後來又組織民兵，並以抗丁，抗糧，抗租為號召，於是盲從日眾，匪勢囂張。皖南各縣，到處糜爛，尤以太平，石埭，旌德，績溪，黟縣，歙縣等縣，四境盡失，閉城固守，政令不能推行至城外，形勢非常嚴重。</p>
<p>皖南指揮所</p>
<p>去年六月間，皖省當局成立皖南督導團，督導整理皖南各縣的行政和基層組織。嗣以皖南自衛力量薄弱，匪情更趨嚴重，乃於去年十月間，成立皖南指揮所，負責指揮整個皖南保安團及保警部隊，成為皖南綏靖勦匪的序列機構。</p>
<p>皖南指揮所首先在蕪湖成立後，就組前進指揮所，率領皖保四團程營，由蕪南下，一舉攻克涇縣，茂林，沿途掃蕩，直抵徽州。陸續將匪方重要軍事根據地如涇屬樵山嶺，績屬上金山，靑屬九華山，寗屬板橋，太屬五溪山，龍門寺，黟屬楊家墩，歙屬橫山店等，逐一予以摧毀，並令飭縣黨部組織戡亂工作隊，隨軍深入匪區，展開重建工作，先後收復鄉鎭二百二十餘處。同時，由各縣政工人員，擴大宣傳，策動匪軍及民兵反正投誠，先後瓦解了民兵十六萬以上。</p>
<p>自衛常備隊</p>
<p>這樣，在軍事上從點綫的克復發展到面的控制，和政治上增强了人民的向心力後，就致力於加强各縣的自衛常備隊。皖南各縣，一年以來，逐漸充實，已先後增編六十七個中隊，增購機槍二百卅餘挺，步槍一千九百餘被·同時，又成立了七個縣聯防區署，和七十六個鄉鎭聯防區署，又增築大小調堡二千三百餘座，發動民力修補省縣公路，並派部隊掃蕩防守，使發展交通，保陣行旅的安全。</p>
<p>兩個大陰謀</p>
<p>一年以來，皖南匪力已被毀損很多，目前匪的目的有二個：一是流竄在山區，以奪取鄉保武力，東奔西竄，到處搶糧，勒索錢物，達到擾亂社會秩序，陂壞後方的目的。一是擴大淆惑愚民靑年，逐漸擴展匪力，並積極圖竄返江西老窠·皖南指揮所針對這二個陰謀，巳籲請政府，添派國軍二團，以國軍為主力，配合省軍，並動員各縣常備自衛隊，在統一指揮下，發動黨政軍民合作，大舉淸剿以求澈底肅淸。衢州綏署主任湯恩伯將軍，最一近曾往皖南視家，決以加强機動性對付匪的流竄，以健全鄉保組織對付「化整為零」。這樣，今後皖南的勦匪工作，當可更臻順利。</p>

<h3>英國大鬧「煙荒」</h3>
<p>— 本報倫敦特約記者　本耿</p>
<p>〔本報倫敦十月廿八日航訊〕英國製造的紙姻，相當著名，但是最近英國國內却發生「姻荒」。在平日，紙姻在英國國內，似乎本就不是可以予取予求的消耗品。通常的辦法如果你是非姻不可甚至於非若干數量的某個牌子的姻不可的話，最好是認定一家姻店，經常定量的購買，這樣，在你取得了「老主顧」的地位之後，對於你，會有不少的方便，不然的話，你很可能得不到你所需要的數量，或者你不能得到你所特別喜歡的牌子。但是無論如何，姻還沒有發生什麼「荒」的問題，不久以前，政府宣布姻草供應量，將减少百分之四，接着就發生烟荒。姻業工會為了姻，找貿易局討論。據說，在某一次的內閣會議中，也提到了這個問題。</p>
<p>英帝國內部之產姻區域，主要為南非之羅特細亞（Rhodesia），但是羅特細亞為了姻草可以換取金元的關係,目下每年只能以其產量的三分之二售與英國。</p>
<p>英國目下每年需要二億零五百萬磅（重量）之姻草，今年已向美國購買一億三千五百萬磅向其他國家購買六千萬磅。兩者合計，尙差一千萬磅左右。因此，只有三個辦法，一為减少供給量，二為增加購買，三為動用庫存。據說·目下烟草的供應量，卽使减少百分之四以後，仍較之戰前為多。戰前每週姻店所得之烟，不過十四億五千萬支，最近曾達十六億支。</p>
<p>目前的姻荒，大約牽涉到兩個因素：一、為近年來吸姻者人數之增加，特別是婦女之抽姻者·二為有些一人聽說姻草供給量將减少百分之四便囤積紙烟。也許有人以為價何不用加稅加價的方法以减少抽姻的人數但是今日英國的姻稅姻價已經很高，去年春間，一包二十枝的香姻，由二先令四便士增加為三先令四便士（價格），現在為三先令六便士。過分的增加，可能引起增加工資的要求。不久以前·貿易局的姻草顧間發表談話，勸告大家每十枝中少抽一枝，同時不要囤紙姻。</p>

<p>三，廠商取得此項輸入加工原料之權利後，一切經由外銷會或紡建公司輸出布疋之加工費用，概按紡建公司核定並經外銷會同意之加工原料起岸價格再加進口關稅及適當之其他實用計算，折換紗布。國內原料市價起落過甚，對於外銷加工布疋應予隔離，以利輸出。</p>
<p>四，廠商輸出布疋手續，仿照外銷會現行規定辦理。至核定應行輸入各種加工原料之手續，則由外銷會於本辦法核准施行後，另案規定之。</p>
<p>五，本辦法自經外銷會核議通過，並徵得中央銀行及輸管會同意後生效，如有未盡事宜，亦由三方會商變更之。</p>
<h3>米市交易仍停頓　麵粉雜糧均續漲</h3>
<p>昨日食米交易仍陷停頓，到貨稀少，市上無貨應市，米店類皆無米出售。因若干產地如平湖等地仍阻止食米出境，故到貨難以轉暢。南市塲到貨七八五石五斗，但未開售，大都向門市出售。北市中白粳報價一百〇五元，到貨祗二〇三石。聞郊區白粳喊價在一百五十元。</p>
<p>麵粉交易，仍無正式開出·前日下午由阜體·福新等六大粉廠開出二三四號粉，二號粉價四十一元，雜牌二號粉喊價再高達五十三元，又漲八元。麩皮再漲二元，為四十五元。</p>
<p>雜糧疾登高峯，一致因缺貨而上漲。黃豆升十五元，苞米·紅糧·各猛漲十七八元之多，菉豆·赤豆莫不大漲，芝蔴再漲一成，生仁升二十元。</p>
<p>食油仿停頓，無貨應市，廠商以原料少成本高，故不開，販運商以產地高，亦不能販運，故無售戶。</p>
<p>豆餅狂灌十四元，大　餅價四十七元。</p>
<h3>廿六期台溏開售　配價一百卅五元</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕台灣糖業公司，昨日午後開售二六期二四號粗砂一二〇〇〇餘包，配價一三五元，核配三〇八家，糖業申購者最高額為每家一〇〇包，內提百分之二十配給公敎人員，又複製糖商及直接用戶，申購額為每家最高額為二〇包，重配得之糖，無須再行提成。</p>
<p>食糖昨日塲內仍未交易，塲外喊價初時頗見升騰，中間因市上銀根奇緊，暗息復呈俏勢，執戶困於頭寸，脫意較鬆，惟供求方面，亦無多數成交，喊價亦高低不一，市况尙屬混亂。</p>
<h3>茶市交易停頓</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕茲據茶業權威人士談稱：自當局准予核本議價以來，各業漸告復常，惟茶市交易，依然陷於停頓，原因為複製廠商鑒於產區茶存旣稀，漲風如火如茶，同時又以人工及一切附屬原料，比前均告陡增，此外更因變更外匯之傳說，甚囂慶上，售意益趨堅化，喊價漫無一止境。聞本年度特祁門，每担高達千元，婺屯大帮狂呌七百元，而輸出商雖擬收吸，但且前價格奇昂，各項花色，卒難做開。</p>
<h3>現棉市况冷落　喊價混亂異常</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕現棉昨日市上無交易，執戶大都觀望不售，產地來源極少，價格朝夕上漲，故市况冷落，周浦籽花喊價亦多混亂。</p>
<p>〔又訊〕經濟管制補充方案公佈後，國棉聯購亦將停止收花，本市各棉商日來正紛紛匯款前往產地展開收棉工作，據悉各產地如漢口南通等地棉花供應並不見旺存量亦不多，原因為限價期內，棉農棉商懼遭當局抄查限價出售，風聲鶴戾之下，均將原棉暗中搬運一空，囤寄於距離較遠之偏僻鄉村，限價開放後，巳迄多日，市上供應仍不多見，各收花行莊業務極為淸淡，預料本年收汛，前途頗為悲觀。</p>
<h3>棉紗喊價混亂　中紡配紗採成品互換方式</h3>
<p>昨日棉紗市塲，仍未開業，塲外以銀根見鬆，交易鼎盛，行情因原料花價迭漲，喊價益形紊亂，各貨再見高峯。細紗四十二支藍鳳猛升至九千五百元有人要進，卅二支銀月六千五百元，廿一支雙馬五千七百元，粗紗二十支金城五千五百元，十六支光明四千五百元，市甚鋒俏。</p>
<p>又訊：中紡公司供售棉紗，價格昨未掛出，聞配售方式有採用物物交換制度，昨以染織業（甲乙丙丁）四組為限，每件二十支紗（今日交換廿支天官大包，）換十二磅細布（56×58）卅一疋，至其他各業下週一開始辦理。</p>
<p>昨棉布喊價狂騰，人心向榮，客胃雖見懈怠，但聞華北游資擁集，號商競吸，更以日前紡建公司供售布疋，限染廠門市，每戶僅十疋，並傳公司方面為供應軍民需要，及挨購原料，自昨（五日）起，該公司及中央銀行開售之紗布，概須換回成品，詳細辦法另訂之。同時又有减工之謠言，市氣因此特俏。十二磅龍頭細布，喊價由二百十元頻升至二百四十元有買戶，四君子元嗶嘰，由二百三十元挺至二百六十元間徘徊，一九〇高檔士林布已喊至四百元關外掙扎，故本市布號仍不能恢復營業。</p>
<h3>市場銀根緊俏　華北游資南下</h3>
<p>市傷昨日銀根仍緊，趨勢較週四巳見帶鬆。暗息日拆由高二十五元退至二十二元，普通在二十元左右，約合月息六角四分。北方游資，票匯數字激增，到埠客輪均有籌碼帶滬，而華南廣州近日物價正告回跌，一般握有資金者，均以上海為目的地，運現與單帮活躍異常。昨日貨帮貼息再登高峯，美麗被面做價四千元，塲內貼息隔日付款，須四千二百元，拆一百元月息在一元五角以上，而浮多仍趨之如驚云。</p>
<h3>收回舊法幣數額　現已達三百萬億</h3>
<p>自幣制改革以來，迄今巳有二月有半，對舊法幣之收兌，將於本月二十日宣告截止。據中央銀行發行局陳副局長告稱，法幣在此二個半月中，已收回三百萬億。此數字相當於舊法幣總發行額之一半，預計除損壞廢棄者外，至少尙可收回二百萬億。至法幣兌換期間是否延長，目前尙未考慮此點云；</p>
<h3>國營事業股票　售出六百餘萬</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕國營事業股票，各地央行及其委託行局截至上月三十日為止，共計售出金圓券六百六十八萬二千五百元。內紡建股票佔三百四十六萬零五百元，台糖股票二百七十八萬七千三百元，台灣紙業三十七萬七千二百元，招商局五萬三千五百元，津紙四千元。</p>
<h3>絲綢一致喊升</h3>
<p>人絲昨日喊價繼續高升，業外各物邇來齊步堅俏，中信局下週配絲否照常供應，業中頗多猜測·故人心一致堅俏·一二〇號天橋喊至九千五百元，東洋升叩萬元關，惟塲外掮客對敲交易，漫無報準，市况仍屬混亂</p>
<p>生絲限價開放後到源仍未見旺，業內因人絲高漲，人心跟升，更以開放朱幾，絲織業抵補殷切，市上見賣卽吸，不問價格，越勢仍有求無供·D級七八均　，由九千餘升至一一二〇〇元，優級零担亦喊高至一一〇〇〇元，其餘未聞成交國。</p>
<p>綢緞因原料高漲、成見跟升，廠方售出稀少，客帮扒吸甚力，本街門售店因限價期內售去不少，連日繼續抵補，市況續俏。華强被面升至五五〇〇元，他如大偉呢等貨均一致挺升。</p>

<h3>題目翼君</h3>
<p>— 翼君</p>
<p>學校舉行考試的時候，學生拿起卷子來，總有人要問：一抄不抄題目？」得到的答覆是不一定的，有的敎師說要抄，有的敎師說不必。碰到說不必的敎師，固然可以不抄題目，而抄了題目也並不妨事，碰到說要抄的敎師呢，則不抄題目，便有點妨碍了。所以，一個人久經考堪有經騐的學生，每當參加考試時，問也好，不問也好，他知道還是以抄了題“為穩妥。</p>
<p>有一位學者說過：「人生是時時刻刻在被考試。」這話我想很對。例如：與人交談，便是受語言·知識·見解……等的考試；購買物件，便是受辨別，選擇，計算……等的考試；吃飯，乃試你的舌頭能辨味否，牙齒能咀嚼否，喉能吞嚥否，胃能消化否……等等；走路，乃試你的脚提得起來否，眼識得紅綠燈否，腦區別得方向否……等等；工人，試他能造出些恙樣的器物；農人，試他能收得些什麼產品；商人，試他能獲得多少利潤；官，好的，試他能為公眾造多少福，壞的，試他貪污的手段如何。</p>
<p>人生是時時刻刻在被考試，信然。</p>
<p>那末，人生的考試，是不是要有題目呢？</p>
<p>伊索寓言里有一則狼吃小羊的故事。故事的大意是：</p>
<p>有一天，一隻小羊走到溪邊去飲水，恰巧碰見了一隻狼，那很急想吃小羊，但是沒有理由。他就厲聲說：「好大的膽子！你竟敢把我溪中的淸水弄濁，敎我怎麼好飲用啊？」</p>
<p>小羊聽了大驚，忙分辯說：「你是站在水的上流，我站在水的下流，我卽使弄髒了水，也不會倒流到你那里去的呀！」</p>
<p>狼便轉口道：「縱然是這樣，但你總是個壞蛋，我聽說你去年曾在背地里罵我駡……」</p>
<p>這時小羊呌起來了：「狼先生，那眞冤枉，去年我還沒生下來呢！」</p>
<p>狼的理由又來了，他露出銳齒，咆哮起來，說：「哼，你這個傢伙，不是你罵的我，那就是你父親了。總之，你是該殺。」便猛撲過去，把可憐的小羊吃掉了。</p>
<p>在上面的故事裏，狼所說的理由，便是他要吃小羊的題目。有了題目，則吃羊的行為便是名正言順的了。是否文不對題，他是不管的。</p>
<p>有許多人，就是狼。春秋時的鄭莊公蓄意要驅逐他的弟弟，便盡量縱容他，故意供給他「多行不義」的種種便利，直等到「大叔完聚，繕甲兵，具卒乘，將襲鄭，夫人將啟之，」才說：「可矣！」（卽是：有題目了。）於是乎，「克段於瑯。」</p>
<p>但是，某許多人之所以異於鄭莊公者，又幾希，</p>
<h3>有酒食先生饌</h3>
<p>— 大均</p>
<p>聽起來似乎神話，但這是事實一個令人感動的事實：居然有些小學敎師還能每日吃着上好的白米，鮮美的菜肴。</p>
<p>昨天，姑婆自鄉間來，她告訴了我鄉間的敎育情况，尤其是小學敎員的吃飯。××廟是南匯縣屬的小鎭，當上海的私立小學敎員已在上演飢寒交迫的悲劇時，××廟的小學敎師却似乎在演喜劇，雖然還是令人心酸的！</p>
<p>開學了，鄉村的孩童顯得非常高興，雖然他們的父兄已不能替他們購置新書包，洋皮球。鄉村學校的收費向來比市區少得多，但數目不大的學費，在農夫眼裏，也是費盡汗血得來的代價。聰明的××小學的敎師們便這樣向學生的家良訂了一個規約：每學期每學生供應敎師校工膳食一天，太貧苦的家長就豁免。吃飯的手續是這樣：早幾天告訴了輪值的學生，學生告訴了家長，在那天，全校敎負校工全部開拔。但出乎意料之外的，鄉人倒是眞正尊師崇道的，他們一早便上了鎭，買了大魚大肉，籃旁還掛了酒瓶，這樣的酒食，簡直像是過節了。</p>
<p>他們一天三餐，早飯由校工到輪值家長處挑來，午晚兩膳，便大家不分風雨晴雪，不管五里六里的前往。……姑婆說到這裏，我似乎見到了農人們誠摯的態度和善良的面容；但是也體會到了敎師的悲苦的心情！</p>
<p>姑婆還對我說：「鄉人多慇懃！臨別還會說：「沒有菜，先生們，怠慢呀！明天是吳全發了嗎？」初次受到這種客氣的好幾位敎師，臉都紅了。」</p>
<h3>湖上雜詩</h3>
<p>— 施叔範</p>
<p>謁岳墓遲桂花流香甚烈</p>
<p>寒鴉唱拜客何詞？倔僵南枝與北枝，扼腕每多身後憾，搖頭自寫眼前詩，當年大節眞無比，我輩孤忠亦近癡，百變蒼黃墓仍綠，漫天一任莾風吹。</p>
<p>高牆晚桂發淸芬，鼻觀收來肺腑辛，為客俄驚秋已老，對公長歎國無人！誰償東海悠悠願？轉想南都草草春。頑鐵軒眉能作語：眼中豎子不如秦。</p>
<p>過南屏</p>
<p>枯墨紛飛樹上鴉，故人百戰死長沙，日斜紅籟山房過，　麥花開映素　。（樓在雷峰塔廢址，舊嘗與夢蓀茗坐，今已圯，故人革裏衡湘，且亦近五年。是日其夫人同游。）</p>

<p>舊恨烟消散薜蘿，女郎又唱采菱歌，蓼叢魚沫浮腥體，慟哭槳邊腐骨多。</p>
<h3>第三次大戰的代價</h3>
<p>— 毛毅</p>
<p>戰事是一件勞民傷財的事，在第二次世界大戰中，僅美國一國就用掉了三千三百億美元，而在戰爭高潮的一九四四年，一年的戰費就達九百億美元之鉅。假如第三次世界大戰爆發，那麼，所耗的生命財產一定更為可觀。十月份「護者文摘」刊載了一篇「另一次戰爭的代價」的文章，其中所列舉的數字雖偏重美國，但亦可推算出下次大戰—假如不可避免的話—的全部代價。</p>
<p>軍費—假定下次大戰武裝的有一千二百萬，所購買的軍火與一九四四年同量，以現在的市價計算就要一千四百三十億美元一年。如果這次戰爭和二次大戰拖延得同樣的久，全部的代價將達五千四百億美元。這還是按現時的美元價值計算的，如美元繼續貶值，當不止此數。</p>
<p>軍火—鋼的價格比一九四五年八月漲起百分之三十七。汽油的價格比那時加倍有餘。橡皮的價格橫跳。原料和製成品的代價在任何可能發生的新戰爭比以前至少多百分之五十。</p>
<p>生命—假如美蘇發生戰爭，要犧牲多少生命是不可能預測的。不但，超過二次大戰的傷亡數目則是毫無疑問。在二次大戰中，美軍陣亡二十九萬四千人，受傷的有六十七萬人。在歐洲戰塲上的傷亡率，可能從德國的經騐中得到啟示。德軍在二次大戰中計陣亡和失踪五百萬人，另有四百萬人受傷，其中大部份都是折損在蘇軍前綫的。</p>
<p>資源—美國在二次大戰中共消耗掉五十多億噸最好的礦產，和八十億桶左右的汽油。下次大戰消耗資源更多。到了戰爭結束，美國將成為一個「一無所有」的國家。</p>
<p>自由—為了控制人力，可能制定「參戰或做工」的法律，適用於六十五歲以下的人。罷工違法，薪水被控制，職業不得任意更換。實行配給制度和限價。民用物資的生產停頓，軍事合同在各地都有優先權。</p>
<p>善後—二次大戰將債務增加到二千二百億美元，利息，退伍軍人的津貼和恤金成為人民的沉重的負擔。如果三次大戰爆發，債務將達三千億美元。利息和退伍軍人的津貼撫恤自然也更形龐大。</p>
<h3>好事近</h3>
<p>— 魯氏</p>
<p>十一月十四日潘公展先生公子維新兄結婚塡小令預祝</p>
<p>十月好時光，邠老面添喜色，令子且嬪佳婦，可向平願畢。慢言擲果舊家聲，才華自超軼，轉瞬良宵却扇，試畫眉新筆。</p>
<h3>財神</h3>
<p>— 石鳴</p>
<p>偶然到印刷所中去找一位朋友，看見他們正在印刷一種彩色的畫片，中間的畫像，是一個面色黧黑，鬚髯繞頰的古裝的武士，手中執了一條鋼鞭，旁邊蹲着一隻老虎。我不知這畫像中的人是誰，說他是打虎的武松吧，然而畫面不像是打虎的情形，而且那老虎並不張牙舞爪。那畫片中究竟是誰呢？我不由得問我的朋友了。朋友告訴我，這是財神，為的不久新年將到，所以做一筆投機生意，印了預備人家買去貼在堂中或是門上的。我聽了不禁有些懷疑。財神，應該可中拿着金條和鈔票，旁邊置的是算盤和賬簿，人是文文雅雅的。現在畫片如斯，眞是有些莫名其妙！朋友又告訴我，證是財神有文武兩種，現在畫片之中的是武財神。我聽了似乎有一些明白，但終覺得畫得不大對，因此又說：對了！文財神用算盤賬簿賺錢。武財神是綠林好漢，那應該拿手槍才對。朋友聽了笑笑，說我只知其一不知其二，說是這張畫片，自有特別精妙之處，叫我想一下。</p>
<p>我默默地坐在旁邊，抽去了半根紙姻，給我想起來了。現在時代，要想發財，先應囤貨。囤紙的叫做「紙老虎」，做金子外匯的叫做「金老虎」，政府取締這種囤戶叫做「打老虎」，那麼，財神與虎是有着相當關係的。財神身邊有的是老虎，那些向財神叩頭的人，便是自願馴伏在財神脚下做老虎的人。財神豢養了老虎，財神當然要保護老虎，手執鋼鞭，預備對打虎者抵抗的。</p>
<p>朋友聽我之說，不禁拍手說對。</p>
<h3>圂向</h3>
<p>在這公敎人員啼飢號寒，這裏停敎，那裏怠工，南北無殊，八方同慨的時候，忽然見到南京電訊，政府於本月份發每員寒衣費三十五元，在政府總算體貼入微。提起「寒衣」，却又是富於詩意的，「寒衣處處催刀尺」，「安得席厦千萬間，大庇天下寒士俱歡顏」，從來讀此詩句者不覺同情之心，油然而生，何况嚴冬已屆的現實，擺在眼前，生活為難的呼籲，遍於大地。見此二字，誰不百感叢生！</p>
<p>「寒衣費」是善意，若說到事實，而今且把故都的衣價略述一二。最廉價的衣市在天橋及東西北城的各小市，一條薄棉被要九十金圓，一件六七成新的棉袍要七八十圓，一件小襖及棉褲亦要三十元上下。所謂「估衣攤」「舊衣棚」的貨，大半是舊的（來源是當舖及打鼓版），或偷工减料的新製，故價錢較廉。若向綢布店買新料，我裁縫舖做新衣，則工料兩項，比「佔衣」加三四倍或六七倍。</p>
<p>估衣攤上的大衣，稍為像樣點（厚實可以擋寒的）總須一百五六十元，皮衣皮筒在去年此際，正是各攤大宗應市，狐羊貂鼠，無所不備，普通一件羊皮袍裏外全新毛長底淨者，不過七八十萬元，狐筒緞面八九成新者，不過二百萬元。而今年此時，則皮貨攤寥寥三五，一個廣大的平民市塲，只見破舊的羊皮，及奧味的犬皮狼皮。若有稍整齊六七成新之羊皮袍，動須三四百金圓，紛紛搶購。狐皮則三五日不相逢，偶或見之，則在一二婦女之手中提賣，乃中人家眷因等錢用急售者，然索價總在一二千圓，誰敢問津！故縱有此貨，亦銷路不仕。</p>
<p>羊皮易銷而貨缺，因皮袍可以省煤，故家有存者不肯出售。市有售者，搶買立盡。攤商有貨在手，居奇待機，藏而不露，因之今年之「寒衣」情形之嚴重，不下於食糧！</p>

<h3>Sun Ke and Legislative Yuan Committee Conveners Exchange Views on the Current Political Situation; Wang Shih-chieh Also Participates and Reports on Diplomacy</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 5th dispatch] Amidst calls for the resignation of the Weng Cabinet, all parties are extremely concerned about the current political situation. Legislative Yuan President Sun Ke hosted a banquet for the conveners of the Legislative Yuan's committees on the 4th to exchange views on the current political situation. At 7 PM on the 5th, the committee conveners jointly hosted a return banquet for Sun, at Sun's suggestion, Wang Shih-chieh was invited to participate. During the banquet, Wang gave an informal report on his attendance at the United Nations General Assembly, and the legislators expressed their opinions. Wang's attitude was sincere, and his analysis of the overall diplomatic situation was very detailed. The banquet ended at around 9 PM.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 5th dispatch] The Weng Cabinet's intention to resign remains firm. However, they still went to the Executive Yuan to work on the 5th, handling various important official matters. The collective resignation of all cabinet members will depend on Weng's actions. The President is still earnestly urging Weng to stay.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 5th dispatch] Finance Minister Wang Yun-wu resumed his duties on the 5th, arriving at the ministry around 9 AM to handle official business and leaving at noon. Wang had not been to the ministry since his resignation on the 1st, for four days. His intention to resign remains firm, but he was moved by the President's repeated sincere entreaties and persuasion. Considering the seriousness of the current situation, he should overcome difficulties together. Before his resignation is approved, he has agreed to reluctantly resume his duties to prevent the interruption of ministry affairs. However, according to Wang's aides, he will continue to request his resignation.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 5th dispatch] Legislators from the nine northeastern provinces and three municipalities held a full-day meeting during the Legislative Yuan's regular session on the 5th to review the evolution of the situation in the Northeast and the issue of responsibility. They issued a statement based on the opinions expressed during the meeting, stating that the fall of Changchun, Jinzhou, and Shenyang "in reality, it is equal to saying that the United Nations has never won peace, and it has not even won victory. World War II is still continuing to develop." The statement criticized the Soviet Union, saying it "is actually a partner of the Axis countries, and today it is even more the successor of the Axis countries." The statement further detailed the government's failures in diplomacy, domestic affairs, economy, military affairs, and education from the signing of the Sino-Soviet Treaty to the takeover of the Northeast, the start of the suppression of bandits, and the eventual fall of the entire Northeast. It severely criticized these failures and hoped that the government could learn from its failures and, from the standpoint of the people of the Northeast, formally inform "the free world, politicians and people, especially American politicians and people," that 40 million people "have entered the dark age of the second September 18th." The statement continued, "We, the people, are fighting for national freedom, so we will not hesitate to shed the last drop of blood against all foreign aggressor forces. At the same time, we must also strive for political democracy before we are willing to contribute all our strength. We are saddened by the loss of our homeland, but we are even more saddened and indignant that we cannot exert the strength of our people." Finally, it demanded that "the privileged class must retreat, and the people's strength must advance" to "seek national freedom, political democracy, and finally, the liberation of all people trapped in darkness and terror."</p>
<h3>Premier Weng Speaks on Truman's Re-election as US President; China and the United States Share the Same Desire to Strive for World Peace</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 5th dispatch] After hearing the news of President Truman's re-election, Premier Weng of the Executive Yuan issued a statement on the 5th as follows: "The election of President Truman for another term in the United States is a matter of great joy upon hearing in China. President Truman has always attached great importance to world peace. After being elected this time, he reiterated his efforts for the future of world peace, which is completely in line with the wishes of the Chinese people. China hopes to achieve true peace, both domestically and internationally. The resistance to totalitarian countries in the past and the current war against the Communist bandits are being pursued with hardship and without fear of difficulties. The only goal is to overcome the causes of the disturbance and lay the foundation for stability and peace. At this time, the Communist bandits' military force is expanding even further, and its threat to the overall situation of world peace is even greater. President Truman has always been sincere in assisting China. It is hoped that under President Truman's leadership, the United States will understand that the situation in China has a great impact on world peace and will actively assist our country's strength so that the legitimate efforts of our government will achieve success sooner."</p>
<h3>Wu Tieh-cheng Issues a Proclamation</h3>
<p>The US Will Provide More Effective Assistance to Us</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 5th dispatch] Wu Tieh-cheng, Secretary-General of the Kuomintang Central Committee, today issued a proclamation in the name of the China National Foreign Affairs Association (Wu is the chairman of the association), stating: "The Chinese people extend their congratulations to the American people and President Truman on President Truman's re-election for the next four years." Wu said: "President Truman has inherited the Democratic Party's policies formulated by the late President Roosevelt during World War II, providing assistance to our country's struggle for freedom and independence. There is no doubt that he will provide greater and more effective assistance to our country, the United States' loyal ally, and bring new hope for a better world."</p>
<h3>Bullitt Will Still Come to China</h3>

<h3>South China Morning Post Editorial: Warning to Reactionaries</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Hong Kong, 5th dispatch] The authoritative South China Morning Post here once again warned leftists and all kinds of anti-government elements who have fled to Hong Kong, saying: "The Hong Kong government is friendly to China, so it will not allow those who live here to engage in any actions against the Chinese government, and it is not a good policy for you to adopt the same line as the Communists."</p>
<h3>US Far East Navy Learns Simulated Warfare, Will Hold Exercise for Three Days Starting on the 17th</h3>
<p>[United Press, Tokyo, 5th dispatch] A US Air Force spokesman said on the 5th that aircraft and warships of the US Far East Command and the Navy's Task Force 38 will conduct a simulated war exercise for three days from November 17th in the Philippines, the East China Sea, and the southwestern waters of Japan.

The Navy will be commanded by Rear Admiral Kinter, and the Air Force will be commanded by Brigadier General Timberlake.</p>
<h3>Truman Wins Election; US Will Continue to Aid China; Both Democrats and Republicans Recognize China as a Pillar of the East; Washington Far East Experts Analyze the Overall Situation</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 4th dispatch] Far East experts here mostly believe that the United States will continue to aid China when analyzing Truman's election victory on the 4th. Many experts concluded that even if the Republican Party had won, the final outcome would have been the same. They said that the amount of assistance would depend on future developments in the Far East and Europe. Although there are few proposals to continue or increase aid to China, Truman has guaranteed to oppose any communist government in China. The current situation in the Far East is critical, and Democratic members of Congress have shown no less awareness than Republican members. Even if the Democratic Party lacks the driving force to aid China, there are still Republican stalwarts who are keen to aid China, such as Judd, Fulton, Voorhis, and Bridges, who have returned to Congress this time. In the past, Republican members of Congress often attacked the Democratic Party's Far East policy. Some Democrats believe that they were not really concerned about the Far East and that this was just a political tactic. The withdrawal of the National Army from the Northeast shocked most Americans, who clearly recognized the danger of communism dominating China. Americans are both afraid of the Communist Party sweeping China and concerned about the entire Far East because the Far East policies of both the Democratic and Republican parties recognize China as the mainstay of the East. Judd told the United Press on the 3rd that the fall of the Northeast was the second "Pearl Harbor" and the "most serious crisis" for the security of the United States itself. Other Far East experts believe that when the next Congress convenes, there will be a surge of support for Judd's views, and key figures from both the Republican and Democratic parties in Congress will listen to this call. The mistakes of the United States' Far East policy before World War II are not far away, and memories are still fresh. It is generally believed that Bloom will once again chair the House Foreign Affairs Committee. Based on his past experience, Bloom is expected to be in line with the President and the Secretary of State. Although it is often said that Marshall opposes further aid to China, well-informed sources claim that Marshall's opposition is not to the principle of aid but to the method of handling aid. They said that if Marshall remains in office, he will recognize that the fate of all Far Eastern countries is linked to the fate of China and will advocate strong assistance. They also said that if the United States continues to aid China, it may stipulate that aid will be given according to the precedent of aiding Greece, sending military and economic advisers to assist Chinese officials in promoting their work. Well-informed sources indicated that Truman's election will by no means reduce China's hopes of receiving aid because the Democratic government has shown no signs of tolerating the Communist Party's domination of China and the East. On the contrary, there is reason to believe that the United States' determination to help Far Eastern countries revive and democratize will be expressed by further aid to China. They said the basic factors of the situation have not changed, and Truman's victory has not altered them.</p>
<h3>Yingkou Retreat: Difficult and Magnificent</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 5th dispatch] Navy Headquarters News: The National Army of Liaoxi and Pan Yang, which retreated from Yingkou this time, has completed a difficult and magnificent feat of retreating in front of the enemy with the support of our navy ships. The entire course from the entrance of the Liaohe River estuary to the city of Yingkou is about sixteen nautical miles. The riverbed is a winding, narrow, and shallow waterway, with the narrowest point being only a quarter of a nautical mile wide and the shallowest point being only about ten feet deep. Navigation is already difficult on weekdays, and the navigation signs have all been destroyed. The Communist army has also set up various obstacles in the waterway. There were more than three sunken ships at marker number eight alone. After our navy worked day and night, it was successfully opened on the 26th. On the 29th, our navy began to assist the Nationalist army in concentrating, suppressing the Communist army on both sides of the Liao River with fierce firepower. By the 1st of this month, all our main forces had completed their concentration, and they began to board and transport troops at noon that day. By the 4th, all our land forces had safely retreated.</p>
<h3>Admiral Badger Announces in Shanghai: The US Will Not Abandon the Qingdao Base; May Send Marines to Shanghai to Protect Overseas Chinese</h3>
<p>[United Press, Shanghai] Admiral Badger, Commander of the US Western Pacific Fleet, came to Shanghai from Qingdao for a short visit. He told reporters yesterday: "The US Western Pacific Fleet has no intention of abandoning the Qingdao base as long as it is beneficial to the interests of the United States and the Chinese people. But this does not indicate that it intends or expects to actively participate in the Chinese civil war, nor does it indicate that it is preparing to evacuate American expatriates and other expatriates in China. The Western Pacific Fleet is stationed in China at the request of the Chinese government to support civilian agencies that aid China, support American diplomatic personnel, and protect the lives and property of American citizens. If it is necessary to evacuate expatriates from this country and other countries, the fleet will fulfill its traditional mission based on humanitarian principles and will provide as much assistance as possible to the people of other countries. If requested, it can also evacuate important figures in Chinese politics, just as it evacuates anyone else. As for the fact that Task Force 38 arrived in China at this critical time, it was a coincidence. The current situation is unlikely to cause the task force to remain in Chinese waters for too long. Western Pacific ships are unwilling to transport munitions or supplies to the war zone for the Chinese army to avoid suspicion of participating in the Chinese civil war and must be especially careful not to show favoritism to either side. The safety of the thousands of American expatriates in China depends on the United States maintaining neutrality. If the Navy violates neutrality, it will endanger their safety." When asked if the US Navy would increase its personnel stationed in Shanghai and send marines here, Badger replied: "This is a possibility, but it is purely protective in nature. Its purpose is to protect American expatriates and take into account the people of other friendly countries. The Marines have a special status as international police, so according to international law, they can land on foreign coasts without being considered an act of war." Badger predicted that the results of the US presidential election would not change the Navy's policy in any way. The US Navy will not participate in the Chinese civil war and will only protect expatriates and support the civilian representatives of the US government. As for the evacuation of naval personnel and their families, there is no problem. Any ship stationed in Qingdao can evacuate all of them, so the Navy's position is the safest.</p>
<h3>American Expatriates in Jiangsu and Anhui Regions Ordered to Consider Evacuation</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] American consulates in Nanjing and Shanghai yesterday simultaneously advised American expatriates residing in Jiangsu and Anhui to consider evacuation while normal means of transport are still available unless there is an urgent need to reside in the area.</p>
<p>The evacuation advisory was issued in Shanghai by the US Consul General in Shanghai to the 3,008 American expatriates registered in the city. In Nanjing, the US Embassy issued the advisory to American expatriates residing in Nanjing and Pukou, estimated to be over a thousand.</p>
<p>The evacuation advisory stated: "Judging from the development of the military situation in North China, the war may continue to spread south, which may interrupt Shanghai's external transportation. At the same time, winter is approaching soon, and the supply of food and fuel is becoming increasingly scarce. Those who remain in Shanghai and its vicinity may encounter various difficulties. Therefore, it is recommended that you consider evacuating while normal means of transport are still available unless you have an urgent need to reside in the area. US Consul General Robert T. Gilbert."</p>
<h3>Tianjin Residents Flock South</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Tianjin, 5th dispatch] There are no signs of a large-scale evacuation of foreign expatriates here, but the Chinese people seem even more unsettled. Those leaving Tianjin are rushing for transportation, and airplanes and transport ships are extremely crowded. The China Merchants Bureau has temporarily suspended registration. The Jin Gang and Yuan Pei, two ships sailing to Shanghai on the 4th and 5th, were chaotic due to the scramble to board the ships.</p>
<h3>Truman Reports: Foreign Aid and Relief Plan</h3>
<p>Dissatisfied with Rice Distribution in Nanjing</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 4th dispatch] President Truman reported on the 4th that China had not fully fulfilled its agreement to receive US relief supplies between April and June 1948. The government stated in the report prepared by the Administrator of the Economic Cooperation Administration that China had clearly not deliberately disregarded the basic principles of the relief agreement, so the failure to fulfill the agreement was due to "the ups and downs of the political, economic, and military situation." The report, the fourth report on relief work, listed the work of the $350 million relief plan for China, Greece, Italy, Austria, and Trieste in the second quarter of 1948. The report pointed out the following errors in the relief program in China: (1) The food ration plan was suspended in Nanjing. (2) Delays in payments in various plans. (3) The inability to set prices at realistic market prices in Shanghai. The report continued: "The Chinese government's records have never been completely accurate and timely," and said that, on the whole, the relief program in China was "successful." The report also said that Chinese officials were "discouraged by low salaries." President Truman warned that US aid must be closely monitored by Americans locally. He emphasized that there were "many difficulties" in providing effective assistance to China. Truman's remarks were considered particularly important in light of the fact that some members of Congress and others are now calling for a sharp increase in aid to China.</p>
<h3>Chairman of Jehol Province Talks About Provincial Affairs</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Chengde, 5th dispatch] After the Chengde National Army defeated the fleeing bandits in southern Chengde on the 4th, people's hearts were settled.

<p>[Our Newspaper, Chengde, 4th dispatch] The Provincial Government held a joint meeting on the 4th, attended by Chairman Sun and the garrison commander Hu Guantian, and decided to: (1) strengthen intelligence, (2) investigate household registration, (3) strengthen city defense, and (4) concentrate forces and intensify the suppression of bandits.</p>

<h3>Legislative Yuan Passes Motion to Send Telegram of Condolence to the Soldiers and Civilians of Taiyuan; Temporary Property Tax Bill Widely Discussed</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 5th dispatch] The Legislative Yuan passed a temporary motion by Zou Shuwen and others in its regular session on the 5th to send a telegram of condolence to Director Yan Xishan and all the soldiers and civilians in Taiyuan who are holding firm.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 5th dispatch] The Legislative Yuan held the 17th meeting of the second session on the 5th, chaired by President Sun. The five government proposals in the report matters, including the adjustment of postal rates, were submitted for review. Then the discussion matters began. Chen Mingxian moved to change the order of the agenda and advance the discussion of the reports of the Finance and Budget Committees on improving the treatment of civil servants. The committee members spoke enthusiastically, all advocating that the adjustment of the treatment of civil servants and teachers should be based on the ability to maintain the lives of their families so that they can work with peace of mind. The distribution system must be handled properly so that they can obtain real benefits. Pan Lianfang and others also proposed amendments to the two proposals A and B (the main points were recorded in this newspaper on October 31) proposed in the review report, advocating that the gold yuan coupons should be issued in full according to the salary amount. If prices rise in the future, the central and provincial governments should issue gold yuan coupons at a higher rate according to the local price index. After discussion, it was decided to resubmit the entire case for review. Then, the Finance Committee's report on the re-examination of the temporary property tax bill was widely discussed, continuing from the previous regular meeting. The opinions of the speaking committee members were roughly divided into three factions: one faction still held opposing views, one faction supported it, and another faction proposed amendments, believing that wealthy families and magnates should be the main targets of collection, and the threshold for collection should be raised. The meeting adjourned at noon. The meeting continued at 3:30 PM in the afternoon to continue the broad discussion for one hour. The three factions' opinions continued to arise. At 4:30 PM, the second reading began, and the articles were discussed one by one. Only the second article, the purpose of taxation, was hotly debated. According to Wu Wangji and others' amendments, the purpose of balancing fiscal revenue and expenditure and developing industry, mining, agriculture, and education was changed to serving as funds for suppressing the rebellion (accounting for 60% of the total revenue) and funds for local autonomy (accounting for 40% of the total revenue). The remaining articles 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 were passed as is. The item of taxable property in Article 8 aroused many opinions again. No conclusion was reached at 6 PM, and it was announced that the meeting would be adjourned after it was decided to continue the meeting on the 6th.</p>
<h3>And the Defensive War Enters a New Stage: Bandit's Fourth Offensive Thwarted · 300,000 Residents Unanimously Mobilized · Yanggao in Northern Shanxi, Chicheng in Eastern Chahar, and Xianghe in Eastern Hebei All Reportedly Recovered</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Xi'an, This Newspaper, 5th] The air force from the Xi'an base was dispatched day and night yesterday and today to bomb and destroy multiple artillery positions of the bandit army on the mountain east of Dalao Mountain and Guadi Gully, killing hundreds of bandits and destroying more than forty bandit wagons in Dongjiazhuang, Shangzhuang, and the east bank of the Fen River in the southern suburbs.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Taiyuan, 5th] The defense of Taiyuan has a tendency to move to a new stage. The fourth offensive launched by the invading bandits on October 31 was met with a heroic joint counterattack by our infantry, air force, and artillery in the battles of Shantou, Numazi, Niutuo Village, etc., and after being crushed, the bandit offensive was again thwarted. From the evening of the 4th to the morning of the 5th, the war in the suburbs has shown a state of tranquility. Only the remnants of the 39th Brigade of bandits in the area east of Numazi, ten miles east of the city, attempted to invade on the evening of the 4th, but were immediately subjected to a flanking attack by powerful national troops. The bandits were attacked from both sides and fled in panic. At night, a gang of bandits attacked our positions near Beiwu City and Xutan, more than 30 miles north of the city, but were repelled by the defending soldiers. Near Numazi and southeast of Songzhuang, there were also gangs of bandits attempting to cause trouble this morning, but they did not succeed.

<h3>Two or Three Things After the Economic Reform</h3>
<p>Economic conditions are the most complex. Once a national policy is changed, when it shifts from its original state to the new level after the change, there will inevitably be a period of disturbance and chaos for a considerable period. This is a fact that cannot be avoided. To shorten this transition period and reduce the degree of chaos, it is essential to take prompt and decisive action and quickly adopt some necessary and reasonable measures to be effective.</p>
<p>As far as the supplementary plan for this financial and economic reform is concerned, such as the immediate cancellation of the exit restriction measures, the quick decision on pricing based on cost for some items, and the preparation for wage adjustments, these efforts are all appropriate and timely measures. However, the phenomenon of market turmoil has not improved so far. In particular, market prices are shouted wildly without any guidelines, and general solo operators, scalpers, and special figures are taking the opportunity to snap up goods, which has increased market chaos and the public's panic. The relevant authorities cannot but bear considerable responsibility for this.</p>
<p>Because the supplementary measures clearly stipulate that items such as yarn, oil, flour, coal, and salt should all be priced by the central government based on cost, and these items are undoubtedly most closely related to people's daily needs. If the prices of these items are quickly determined and universally enforced, not only can clear guidance be obtained for future living standards and management policies, but also there will be standards for other general price negotiations and free markets to refer to. It is a pity that the central government is too busy with personnel matters at this critical moment and has not paid attention to this. According to local authorities, even the routine documents of this supplementary plan have not yet been forwarded. No wonder there is so much turmoil everywhere, without a practical solution.</p>
<p>The relevant ministries and departments may think that other important items, namely daily necessities and industrial raw materials, have been authorized to be managed by local authorities, and that the central government should not be solely responsible. However, various prices are mutually related. For example, if the price of cotton cloth is not determined, local authorities will have no way to start with the price of cotton, its main raw material. Also, the price of coal briquettes should of course be based on the price of coal. Now that the price of coal has not yet been determined by the central government, how can local authorities deliberate? We are not saying these words to shirk responsibility for local governments. There are now many counties and cities that have not even earnestly abolished the previous ban on obstructing the outflow of goods in accordance with the central government's intentions, and even inspections and searches have intensified. There is even less talk of pricing or price negotiations. This is really too outrageous! But why are government orders so slow? And why does the higher-level agency allow it to happen naturally without supervision? The higher-level authorities cannot say that they have no responsibility at all.</p>
<p>In addition to prices, the most crucial issue is the adjustment of wages and salaries for civil servants and teachers. The salaries of civil servants and teachers have already been decided by the three-day administrative meeting to increase by one and a half times according to the October standard. The resolution of this issue can be considered quite fast, but it completely ignores the current facts. Because current prices are at least four or five times higher than before, even seven or eight times higher. Take the postal service operated by the government itself as an example. Once adjusted, it jumped up twenty times. Why is the salary of civil servants and teachers only allowed to increase by one and a half times? In addition, the total amount of currency issued at the end of October has reached about 1.6 billion yuan. Except for about 600 million yuan issued to redeem gold notes, it has actually increased fivefold. In this situation, it is not difficult to imagine the future trend of prices. Why are rigid regulations still being made, refusing to restore the index calculation method? Therefore, the government may think that this problem has been solved, but in fact it cannot be solved.</p>
<p>As for how to adjust winter wages, this issue is even more serious. Because according to the central government's intention, the cost of living index can only be used as a reference, but not as a standard. Moreover, this reference material must still be kept secret and not allowed to be published. We also know that the cost of living index is not the only standard for calculating wages. In the past, when salaries were calculated based on the index, there were indeed many criticisms. However, in the absence of other more reasonable standards, this statistic is at least a scale that all parties can trust and abide by. Since the central government allows the index to be used as a reference, it can be seen that they have not denied that it has reasonable value. Why is it not allowed to be used as a calculation standard? And why is it not allowed to be published on a regular basis? Do they think that the wage issue is as simple as the salaries of civil servants and teachers, and can be resolved with an order? Now, the city's Chamber of Commerce, Industrial Association, and General Labor Union have jointly telegraphed requesting the official restoration of the index as the standard for adjusting wages. We hope that the central government will quickly consider appropriate measures to eliminate the many labor disputes that are just beginning.</p>
<p>Following the supplementary nine-point plan, there are many urgent issues to be resolved, such as how to handle foreign exchange, how to maintain rationing, how to change bank interest rates, how to open up loans for production enterprises, and how to conduct import and export trade. These are all things that the central authorities cannot delay. At the local level, there are naturally many tasks that need to be sorted out, such as how to clear and return sealed goods? Should the method of purchasing and borrowing with vouchers continue to exist in the future? In addition to concealing gold notes and not reporting them, should the method of randomly reporting accusations be used to harass industrial and commercial operators? There are still some commodities priced based on cost that have not been formally decided. How should the procedures be completed as soon as possible? These are all urgent issues to be resolved now. Among them, the most concerned by the public and the most difficult to handle is how to implement price negotiations. That is, after pricing based on cost, how to make these prices effectively take effect and no longer have a black market. This is where the success or failure of the new plan lies, and it is also the most important task for all localities. After suffering from the pain of rigid price limits, everyone naturally does not want to repeat the old story and return to the strictly controlled situation of the past. However, negotiating without limiting is the same as not negotiating, and limiting after negotiating first clearly takes into account production costs and the interests of merchants, and does not force any party to suffer unreasonable losses. Therefore, general merchants should automatically restrain each other and earnestly abide by the price negotiations, and not engage in the pursuit of excessive profits, harming themselves and others!</p>
<h3>The Executive Yuan Allocates 20 Million Yuan for Grain Storage in Beiping, Tianjin, and Hebei, Distributed by the Commander-in-Chief of the North China Suppression with a Ratio of 5</h3>

<h3>Milling "Health Rice" The Fujian Provincial Agricultural Improvement Office Plans to Establish a "Health Rice Factory"</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Fuzhou, 5th] The Fujian Provincial Agricultural Improvement Office recently plans to establish a "Health Rice Factory" to specialize in milling "health rice" that is rich in nutritional value.

<h3>22 Kilometers from Guangzhou, the Guangzhou-Kowloon Train Derails and Is Robbed; A Total of 10 Passengers and Rescuing Military Police Officers Are Killed</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Guangzhou, This Newspaper, 5th] The last Guangzhou-Kowloon train from Hong Kong on the 4th derailed and was robbed near Jishan, 22 kilometers from Guangzhou, at 7:00 p.m. The reporter went to the scene of the accident in person on the morning of the 5th and saw that the locomotive had overturned and split into two sections.

<h3>Yan Jiagan Flies to Taipei to Discuss New Financial and Economic Measures and the Use of US Aid</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Taipei, This Newspaper, 5th] After being repeatedly summoned by Wei Daoming, Yan Jiagan flew to Taiwan on the morning of the 5th. After getting off the plane, he immediately met with Chairman Wei for a long talk to discuss the new financial and economic measures to be taken in the province in the future. At 3:00 p.m., Yan met with reporters and said that his mission here was to discuss the financial and economic measures that Taiwan Province should take in the future and to negotiate the use of the US aid receiving agency in Taiwan Province. Regarding financial and economic matters, Yan said that the economic development of the mainland has obviously had a significant impact on Taiwan Province, and that Taiwan's own economic situation should be able to avoid this phenomenon. The key is the current value of the Taiwan dollar. The central government has adjusted the Taiwan exchange rate and decided on the principle of reasonable adjustments in the future, which has provided important guarantees for stabilizing the Taiwan economy. How to make it more stable still needs to be studied and discussed. Regarding the US aid issue, Yan first made a comprehensive report, saying that the economic assistance part totaled 275 million US dollars (of which nine-tenths were grants and one-tenth was loans), including 20,380,000 US dollars in grants for grain, cotton, petroleum and its products, and fertilizers. Except for grain, Taiwan can obtain quotas for cotton, petroleum, etc. The quota for cotton will be distributed based on the number of spindles in operation. A large amount of crude oil will be supplied to the Kaohsiung Petroleum Plant for petroleum. Taiwan will receive a considerable amount of fertilizers, but the method of distribution has not yet been determined. There are also 70 million US dollars for the construction part, half of which is to supplement funds, 25 million US dollars is for special construction funds, and the remaining 10 million US dollars is for the Rural Reconstruction Joint Committee. Taiwan has received the following US aid for the construction part: (1) 2.5 million US dollars for power equipment, (2) 3.5 million US dollars for special construction funds, 1.5 million US dollars for railways, (3) 5 million US dollars for fertilizers, (4) 1 million US dollars for sugar, (5) 250,000 US dollars for the groundwater development plan. Regarding the development of groundwater, Yan said that Hawaii has been very successful. After investigation by American experts, Taiwan also believes that there are water sources that can be used for water supply and agricultural irrigation. If development is successful, it will become a new resource for Taiwan. A small amount of aid will also be obtained for coal mines. Yan finally said that the US aid materials are not limited to purchases in the United States. The only condition is the lowest price. The purpose is to enable US aid to have economic exchanges with other countries and benefit each other. These imported products replace regular imports, so they have the effect of balancing international payments and contracting currency internally. As for the aid for the construction part, people generally misunderstand that it must be completely controlled by the US. In fact, according to bilateral agreements, the United States is only responsible for the overall design for the replacement of equipment or the new establishment of projects. All project commissions are based on the conditions of the lowest price, the fastest time, and the highest quality. Yan is scheduled to return to Shanghai in three days to take care of the affairs of the US Aid Council and will come to Taiwan again, and will stay for a longer period of time.</p>

This time, they demanded to improve their treatment. Their salaries were paid by the Ministry of National Defense, so they were no different from general public school staff, and their income was still very small. Therefore, they went on strike on the 5th. Most of the work of the group was done by non-American staff. The strike has had a significant impact on the group. The head of the US Military Advisory Group, Ba Dawei, has consulted with the Ministry of National Defense on the 5th to discuss solutions.</p>

<h3>The United States Decides to Maintain a Strong Force to Prevent Communist Threat to Western Europe; UN Political Committee Debates the Greek Situation; The US Hopes that Greece's Neighbors Will Correct the Current Situation</h3>
<p>[United Press, Paris, 5th] The US representative, Dulles, declared at the end of the debate on the Greek issue in the UN Political Committee on the 5th, "The United States is currently arming because the Soviet Union and communism threaten the sovereignty of various countries, and the world fears both. Our strength is not only for our own use." Dulles also said that the Soviet representative Vyshinsky's constant criticism of the US foreign policy initiatives was "malicious slander." He said, "Vyshinsky accuses us of developing Greece into a so-called US-dominated base for global aggression. By this, he wants to divert the world's attention from Greece. We firmly deny such malicious slander." He said that the reason why the United States suspended disarmament was that the world feared the Soviet Union, and the United States "is determined to maintain a strong force" until communism no longer threatens the sovereignty of various countries. Dulles said that US diplomacy is clear and upright, with nothing to be ashamed of. "What we have done is not the behavior of those who aim to dominate the world. The United States has suspended its disarmament plan today, and this is true. However, the defeat of Germany and Japan has not eradicated the fear in people's hearts. This is a new fear that cannot be eliminated by international organizations. The partial reason is that the Security Council has become paralyzed." He said that some countries do not even dare to express their fear.

<h3>Atomic Energy Control Plan; UN General Assembly Passes Suggestions from Western Countries; Six Countries to Consult and Seek a Basis for Agreement</h3>
<p>[United Press, Paris, 4th] The United Nations General Assembly today passed the international atomic control plan proposed by the United States with a vote of forty to six, by a show of hands.

The Soviet counterproposal and the Indian compromise proposal were both rejected beforehand.</p>
<p>Soviet representative Vyshinsky criticized the US plan, saying that since there is no possibility of agreement between East and West, there is no room for discussion on atomic control. The US plan is false and untrue and will only subject the economic life of other countries to the trampling of its controlling agencies. Philippine representative Romulo regretted that the Soviet Union could not implement the spirit of compromise it showed at the beginning of the conference. The contents of the atomic control plan passed by the General Assembly are as follows: (1) Approve the atomic control plan agreed to by the majority as the basis for establishing effective international control. The plan was drafted two years ago by the US representative to the Atomic Energy Commission, Baruch. (2) Formally express concern about the stalemate between the Soviet Union and Western countries on the atomic issue. (The Soviet Union opposes the monitoring provisions in the Baruch Plan). (3) Request the six countries of China, the United States, Britain, France, the Soviet Union, and Canada to jointly study whether there is a basis for agreement and submit a report before the next General Assembly. (4) Order the Atomic Energy Commission to continue the work that was suspended this spring.</p>

During the appeal period, they are allowed to be released on bail upon providing the original guarantee.</p>
<p>The criminal facts listed in the judgment include: Zhai Wenqiao, while serving in the bank in the summer of the 36th year of the Republic of China (1947), formulated temporary accounting procedures and circulated them to all branches of the bank for implementation, instructing them to establish secret accounts and ledgers and procedures for handling cash receipts and disbursements. According to the secret account ledgers and the balance sheets of various departments of the Shanghai Branch on June 19th, 20th, and 23rd of the 36th year of the Republic of China, the deposits listed therein amounted to more than 4.8 billion yuan, and the total assets and liabilities were more than 7.9 billion yuan. At the same time, the regulations of the branch required that the deposits listed in the ledgers be only 2.7 billion yuan, and the total assets and liabilities were only 6.5 billion yuan. The amount of business in the secret accounts was far greater than the amount of business listed in the regular ledgers.

<p>[Our Newspaper] Gui Sheng, the captain of the Criminal Police Team in Shanghai County, along with team member Li Longfu, inspected vehicles on Minhang Road on August 11th of last year. As a result, they found a package of heroin weighing 12 ounces on four passengers: Wang Li Shi, Xu Xiu Fang, Li Xi Ying, and Chen Xiao Ren. Except for Chen Xiao Ren, who was released on bail, the rest were detained. Ding then swallowed ten ounces of the heroin and falsely told the detainees, "It is being sent to the forensic doctor for examination. When you are sent to court in the future, you should only say it was two ounces; saying more will get you into trouble with the officials." The case was discovered in Shanghai County, and the three suspects were sent to the Shanghai Government's Judicial Office for questioning. After interrogation, it was learned that Ding had embezzled ten ounces of heroin. County Magistrate Yu Yueqiu of the county then detained Ding and Li. Subsequently, Li died due to illness. The county had not yet concluded the investigation when someone secretly reported to the Third District Public Office of Jiangsu and the Jiangsu Provincial Government, claiming that County Magistrate Yu Yueqiu, County Police Chief Yang Huanzhang, and Security Captain Xu Shaoyun colluded with Li and others to embezzle and commit fraud. Upon receiving the report, the Provincial Government transferred the case to the Jiangsu High Prosecutor's Office, but due to a jurisdictional error, it was transferred to the Wuxian District Prosecutor's Office. After submission through the Supreme Court, it was designated to be investigated by the Shanghai Municipal District Prosecutor's Office. Yesterday, after the investigation was concluded, Ding Guisheng was prosecuted for embezzlement and malfeasance.

<h3>Celluloid Industry Association Makes Five Demands</h3>
<p>Wang Keqin, Chairman of the Shanghai Celluloid Industry Association, hosted reporters yesterday and made a statement: It was previously reported that the municipal authorities would order celluloid factories in the urban area to relocate to special industrial zones within three months and would first order them to suspend operations and quickly plan for relocation, etc. However, most of our celluloid industry consists of family workshops, and the hardships of daily life are unimaginable to those who have not experienced them personally. Therefore, we feel particularly difficult about building houses and relocating. However, government orders should be strictly followed. For the sake of both sides, we propose that the authorities approve the following: (1) If the report about the upcoming order to suspend operations is true, it should not be implemented to avoid the worry of starvation among the members of this association. (2) We hope the Land Administration Bureau will assist in leasing land. (3) We ask for the approval of loans to facilitate land leasing and house construction. (4) We hope the Public Utilities Bureau will assist in installing water, electricity, and public telephones. (5) We hope the Police Bureau will install fire-fighting equipment and security guards. If the above five items are approved by the authorities, the member factories of this association will start relocation.</p>

<h3>Suppression Work in Southern Anhui</h3>
<p>— Our Reporter Huang Xingtian</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Tunxi, 2nd] The hilly area of 23 counties in southern Anhui is suitable for the growth and development of bandits, especially those areas bordering Anhui, Zhejiang, Anhui, Jiangxi, and Anhui, Jiangsu, where the terrain is complex and administratively a no-man's land. In the past, southern Anhui was particularly prosperous in culture and produced many talented people, which led to a civil character that valued literature over military affairs. The residents all had a gentle character. Due to these natural environments and favorable conditions, southern Anhui has always been a place where banditry is particularly prevalent. This reporter visited southern Anhui this time and will briefly report what I know.</p>
<p>This is the Third Generation</p>
<p>The current bandits in Anhui are already the third generation. Initially, during the suppression of the Communists in Jiangxi in the 23rd year of the Republic of China, Fang Zhimin led 70,000 to 80,000 troops into southern Anhui to establish a base. The second time was when Ye Ting's "New Fourth Army" returned to southern Anhui, established a base, and grew to 50,000 to 60,000 people. Now, this third generation of bandits are old subordinates of the "New Fourth Army" who have learned from the lessons of the second time and have gradually grown. The current title is "Southern Anhui Detachment of the People's Liberation Army of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, and Jiangxi." The combat-ready troops are approximately 4,000 people. However, according to official reports, its strength is approximately 11,500 people, with one heavy machine gun, more than 30 light machine guns, more than 60 short guns, and more than 1,700 rifles. Its commander is Xiong Zhaoren, deputy commanders are Liu Kui and Lin Hao, political commissar is Hu Ming, and chief of staff is Yang Ming.</p>
<p>A small number of remnants left behind by the "New Fourth Army" lurked among the people and secretly carried out activities, which were not noticed by the local government and local gentry. In the spring of the 36th year of the Republic of China, they began to stir, recruiting bandits and coercing hooligans, and then seizing rural security forces to establish mountain bases. Later, they organized militias and used resistance to conscription, resistance to grain, and resistance to rent as slogans. As a result, many blindly followed, and the bandit forces became rampant. All counties in southern Anhui were devastated, especially Taiping, Shitai, Jingde, Jixi, Yixian, and Shexian counties. All four borders were lost, and they closed their city gates to defend themselves. Government orders could not be enforced outside the city, and the situation was very serious.</p>
<p>Southern Anhui Headquarters</p>
<p>In June of last year, the Anhui Provincial Authorities established the Southern Anhui Supervision Group to supervise and reorganize the administration and grass-roots organizations of the counties in southern Anhui. Subsequently, due to the weak self-defense forces in southern Anhui and the further aggravation of the bandit situation, the Southern Anhui Headquarters was established in October of last year to be responsible for commanding the entire Southern Anhui Security Regiment and Security Police Force, becoming a sequential organization for the suppression of bandits in southern Anhui.</p>
<p>After the Southern Anhui Headquarters was first established in Wuhu, it formed an advance command post and led Cheng Ying of the Fourth Anhui Security Regiment southward, capturing Jingxian and Maolin in one fell swoop. It swept along the way and went straight to Huizhou. It successively destroyed important military bases of the bandits, such as Qiaoshanling in Jing County, Shangjinshan in Jixi County, Jiuhuashan in Qingyang County, Banqiao in Ningguo County, Wuxishan and Longmensi in Taiping County, Yangjiadun in Yixian County, and Hengshandian in Shexian County. It ordered the county party headquarters to organize anti-rebellion work teams to go deep into the bandit areas with the army to carry out reconstruction work, and successively recovered more than 220 towns and villages. At the same time, political workers from various counties expanded propaganda and instigated bandits and militias to turn against the government and surrender, successively disintegrating more than 160,000 militias.</p>
<p>Self-Defense Regular Army</p>
<p>In this way, after developing from point-line recovery to area control in military affairs, and strengthening the people's sense of belonging in politics, it focused on strengthening the self-defense regular army in various counties. The counties in southern Anhui have gradually been replenished over the past year, and 67 companies have been added successively, and more than 230 machine guns and more than 1,900 rifles have been purchased. At the same time, seven county joint defense district offices and 76 township joint defense district offices were established, and more than 2,300 large and small watchtowers were built. Civilian forces were mobilized to repair provincial and county highways, and troops were dispatched to sweep and defend them, so as to develop transportation and protect the safety of travelers.</p>
<p>Two Major Conspiracies</p>
<p>Over the past year, the bandit forces in southern Anhui have been greatly damaged. Currently, the bandits have two goals: one is to roam in the mountains, seize rural security forces, run around, rob grain everywhere, and extort money and goods to disrupt social order and damage the rear. The other is to expand the confusion of ignorant people and youth, gradually expand the bandit forces, and actively try to flee back to the old lair in Jiangxi. In response to these two conspiracies, the Southern Anhui Headquarters has appealed to the government to add two regiments of the National Army to use the National Army as the main force, cooperate with the provincial army, and mobilize the regular self-defense forces of various counties. Under unified command, the party, government, army, and people are mobilized to cooperate and launch a major suppression in order to thoroughly eliminate them. General Tang Enbo, Director of the Quzhou Pacification Headquarters, recently went to southern Anhui to inspect and decided to strengthen mobility to deal with the bandits' roaming and to improve the rural security organization to deal with "breaking into parts." In this way, the suppression work in southern Anhui will be smoother in the future.</p>

<h3>"Tobacco Famine" in Great Britain</h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent in London for This Newspaper: Ben Geng</p>
<p>[Airmail from this newspaper, London, October 28th] British-made cigarettes are quite famous, but recently a "tobacco famine" has occurred in Great Britain. In normal times, cigarettes in Great Britain do not seem to be a readily available consumable. The usual approach is, if you absolutely must have cigarettes, or even a specific quantity of a certain brand, it's best to identify a tobacco shop and regularly buy a fixed amount. This way, after establishing yourself as a "regular customer," you'll have many advantages. Otherwise, you might not get the quantity you need, or you might not get the brand you particularly like. But in any case, the problem of a "famine" had not yet occurred. Not long ago, the government announced that the supply of tobacco would be reduced by four percent, and then the tobacco famine occurred. The tobacco industry union approached the Board of Trade to discuss the situation. It is said that the issue was also raised in a recent cabinet meeting.</p>
<p>The main tobacco-producing region within the British Empire is Rhodesia in South Africa. However, because Rhodesia can exchange tobacco for gold dollars, it currently only sells two-thirds of its production to Great Britain each year.</p>
<p>Great Britain currently needs 205 million pounds (weight) of tobacco each year. This year, it has already purchased 135 million pounds from the United States and 60 million pounds from other countries. The total falls short by about 10 million pounds. Therefore, there are only three solutions: reduce the supply, increase purchases, or use stockpiles. It is said that even after reducing the tobacco supply by four percent, it is still more than before the war. Before the war, tobacco shops received only 1.45 billion cigarettes per week. Recently, it has reached 1.6 billion cigarettes.</p>
<p>The current tobacco famine involves approximately two factors: 1. The increase in the number of smokers in recent years, especially women smokers; 2. Some people, hearing that the tobacco supply would be reduced by four percent, are hoarding cigarettes. Perhaps some people think, why not use the method of increasing taxes and prices to reduce the number of smokers? But today's tobacco taxes and prices in Great Britain are already very high. Last spring, a pack of twenty cigarettes increased from two shillings and four pence to three shillings and four pence (price), and now it is three shillings and six pence. Excessive increases could lead to demands for wage increases. Not long ago, the Board of Trade's tobacco advisor made a speech, advising everyone to smoke one less cigarette out of every ten, and not to hoard cigarettes.</p>

<h3>Wheel Management Committee Establishes Five Principles: Exporting Cloth in Exchange for Raw Materials</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] The China Yarn and Cloth United Cooperative, in order to increase domestic textile production and actively expand exports, and in view of the domestic cotton shortage and the urgent need for finished products abroad, in order to regulate raw materials to facilitate exports, after consulting with the Export Control Committee and other relevant institutions, and with the approval of the 31st meeting of the Committee, has specially formulated measures for allowing the import of processing raw materials for export cloth, with the following five principles:</p>
<p>1.  The permission to import processing raw materials shall be calculated from the date of October 5th, when the Export Control Committee invited various agencies to discuss the principles for importing processing raw materials. All processed cloth transported for export shall be subject to the actual needs and, after deducting the raw materials that can be produced domestically, shall be certified by the Export Sales Committee and submitted to the Export Control Committee for approval of the import permit. The assessment of the actual needs shall be handled by a technical committee organized by the allocation office, promotion office, textile construction company, 6th district association, dyeing and weaving industry association, and the export sales committee, each sending one person.</p>
<p>2.  The foreign exchange required for importing raw materials shall be paid by the applicant exporting cloth of equal value, and the proceeds shall be used to pay for the imported raw materials. The export certificate (i.e., CBC86 foreign exchange settlement certificate) shall be certified by the Export Sales Committee and forwarded to the Export Control Committee for approval.</p>
<p>3.  After a manufacturer obtains the right to import processing raw materials, all processing fees for exporting cloth through the Export Sales Committee or the Textile Construction Company shall be converted into yarn and cloth according to the cost of the processing raw materials at the port of entry, as approved by the Textile Construction Company and agreed upon by the Export Sales Committee, plus import duties and appropriate other practical calculations. Domestic raw material market price fluctuations that are excessive should be isolated for external sales of processed fabrics, to facilitate export.</p>
<p>4.  The procedures for manufacturers to export cloth shall be carried out in accordance with the current regulations of the Export Sales Committee. The procedures for approving the import of various processing raw materials shall be prescribed separately by the Export Sales Committee after the approval and implementation of these measures.</p>
<p>5.  These measures shall take effect after being approved by the Export Sales Committee and obtaining the consent of the Central Bank and the Export Control Committee. If there are any omissions, the three parties shall consult and make changes.</p>
<h3>Rice Market Transactions Still Suspended; Flour and Grains Continue to Rise</h3>
<p>Yesterday, rice transactions were still suspended, with scarce arrivals and no goods on the market. Rice shops had no rice for sale. Because some producing areas, such as Pinghu, are still preventing rice from leaving the area, arrivals are difficult to improve. 785 piculs and 5 dou arrived at the South Market, but were not opened for sale, and were mostly sold at the door. The North Market quoted 105 yuan for medium white japonica rice, with only 203 piculs arriving. It is reported that the price of white japonica rice in the suburbs is 150 yuan.</p>
<p>Flour transactions have not yet officially opened. The six major flour mills, including Fu Ti and Fu Xin, opened grades 234 and 2 flour in the afternoon. Grade 2 flour was priced at 41 yuan, and miscellaneous brand grade 2 flour was quoted as high as 53 yuan, another increase of 8 yuan. Wheat bran rose another 2 yuan to 45 yuan.</p>
<p>Miscellaneous grains are rapidly climbing to a peak, rising unanimously due to shortages. Soybeans rose 15 yuan, and corn and red sorghum each soared by as much as 17 or 18 yuan. Mung beans and red beans have risen sharply, sesame seeds have risen another 10%, and shelled peanuts have risen 20 yuan.</p>
<p>Edible oil is similarly stagnant, with no goods on the market. Manufacturers are not opening due to low raw materials and high costs, and traders cannot transport them due to high prices in the producing areas, so there are no sellers.</p>
<p>Soybean cake soared by 14 yuan, and large bean cake was priced at 47 yuan.</p>
<h3>26th Period of Taiwan Sugar for Sale; Allotment Price 135 Yuan</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] The Taiwan Sugar Corporation yesterday afternoon put up for sale over 12,000 bags of No. 24 raw sugar from the 26th period, with an allotment price of 135 yuan, allotted to 308 companies. The maximum amount applied for by sugar merchants was 100 bags per company, with 20% of that amount set aside for public servants and teachers. For re-refined sugar merchants and direct users, the maximum amount applied for was 20 bags per company, and the sugar obtained through redistribution did not need to be set aside again.</p>
<p>Yesterday, sugar was not traded in the market. Initial spot prices were quite inflated. In the middle of trading, the market’s cash flow became tight. Interest rates crept back up. Speculators caught up in capital flow problems showed a willingness to offload inventory. Overall, there were not many transactions at the spot market. Quoted prices varied greatly. The market looked chaotic.</p>
<h3>Tea Market Transactions Stalled</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] According to tea industry authorities: Since the authorities permitted negotiated pricing, various industries have gradually returned to normal, but tea market transactions remain stalled. The reason is that re-refining manufacturers are aware that tea stocks in the producing areas are scarce, prices are rising rapidly, labor and all ancillary raw materials have increased sharply, and rumors of changes in foreign exchange have become widespread, further strengthening the reluctance to sell, with prices rising without limit. It is reported that this year's special Keemun tea costs as much as 1,000 yuan per dan, and Wutun large batches are quoted at 700 yuan, and although exporters intend to purchase them, the current prices are extremely high, and it is difficult to open up various patterns.</p>
<h3>Spot Cotton Market Stagnant; Quoted Prices Chaotic</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] There were no transactions in the spot cotton market yesterday. Most speculators are watching and not selling. Sources from producing areas are extremely scarce, and prices are rising day and night, so the market is stagnant, and the quoted prices for Zhoupu seed cotton are also very chaotic.</p>
<p>[Another report] After the announcement of the supplementary economic control plan, the National Cotton United Purchasing Company will also stop purchasing cotton. Cotton merchants in the city have recently been remitting funds to the producing areas to start cotton purchasing work. It is reported that the cotton supply in various producing areas such as Hankou and Nantong is not strong, and the inventory is not large. The reason is that during the price restriction period, cotton farmers and cotton merchants were afraid of being searched by the authorities and selling at the restricted price. Under the atmosphere of panic, the raw cotton was secretly moved away and stockpiled in remote villages far away. It has been many days since the price restriction was lifted, but there are still not many supplies on the market. The business of various cotton purchasing firms is extremely quiet, and the prospects for this year's harvest are expected to be pessimistic.</p>
<h3>Cotton Yarn Quoted Prices Chaotic; China Textile Allotments Adopt Finished Product Exchange Method</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the cotton yarn market was still not open. Outside the market, transactions were booming due to the loosening of credit. Prices were increasingly chaotic due to the rising cost of raw cotton, and prices hit new peaks. 42-count fine yarn Blue Phoenix soared to 9,500 yuan, with buyers willing to purchase. 32-count Silver Moon was at 6,500 yuan, 21-count Double Horse was at 5,700 yuan, 20-count coarse yarn Golden City was at 5,500 yuan, and 16-count Guangming was at 4,500 yuan. The market was very active.</p>
<p>Another report: The China Textile Company's supply of cotton yarn did not post prices yesterday. It is reported that the allotment method adopted a barter system. Yesterday, dyeing and weaving industries (A, B, C, D) were limited to four groups. Each piece of 20-count yarn (exchanged today for 20-count Tianguan big bag) was exchanged for 12 pounds of fine cloth (56×58) 31 bolts. Other industries will start processing next Monday.</p>
<p>Yesterday, cotton cloth quoted prices soared, and people were optimistic. Although customers seemed hesitant, it was heard that capital from North China was pouring in, and brokers were competing to purchase. Moreover, the Textile Construction Company's supply of cloth to dyeing factories and retail stores was limited to only ten bolts per household, and it was rumored that the company needed to exchange for finished products in order to supply military and civilian needs and purchase raw materials. From yesterday (5th), the yarn and cloth sold by the company and the Central Bank must be exchanged for finished products, and detailed measures will be formulated separately. At the same time, there were rumors of layoffs, so the market was particularly active. 12-pound Longtou fine cloth was quoted at 210 yuan to 240 yuan with buyers willing to pay. Four Gentlemen Yuan Bi Ji hovered between 230 yuan and 260 yuan. 190 high-grade shilin cloth was quoted at 400 yuan. Therefore, cloth shops in the city still cannot resume business.</p>
<h3>Tight Money Market; Capital from North China Flows South</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the money market remained tight, but the trend was slightly looser than on Thursday. Overnight interest rates fell from a high of 25 yuan to 22 yuan, and the average was around 20 yuan, equivalent to a monthly interest rate of 6.4%. The number of remittances from northern capital has increased sharply. Passenger ships arriving at the port all carry funds to Shanghai. In South China, Guangzhou, commodity prices have recently fallen back. Those with funds generally consider Shanghai as their destination. Cash transport and single-item trading are exceptionally active. Yesterday, the interest rates for cargo escorts soared again. The price for beautiful bedding was 4,000 yuan. The overnight interest rate for same-day payments was 4,200 yuan. A monthly interest rate of 1.5 yuan for every 100 yuan was charged, but there were still many people scrambling to pay.</p>
<h3>Amount of Old Legal Tender Recalled Reaches 300 Trillion</h3>
<p>It has been two and a half months since the currency reform. The exchange of old legal tender will be declared closed on the 20th of this month. According to Deputy Director Chen of the Issuing Bureau of the Central Bank, 300 trillion legal tender has been recalled in these two and a half months. This figure is equivalent to half of the total amount of old legal tender issued. It is estimated that at least 200 trillion can still be recovered, excluding damaged and discarded currency. Whether the exchange period for legal tender will be extended is not currently being considered.</p>
<h3>State-Owned Enterprise Shares Sold for Over 6 Million</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] As of the end of last month, the Central Bank and its entrusted banks in various locations have sold state-owned enterprise shares totaling 6,682,500 gold yuan. Textile Construction shares accounted for 3,460,500 yuan, Taiwan Sugar shares for 2,787,300 yuan, Taiwan Paper Industry for 377,200 yuan, China Merchants Bureau for 53,500 yuan, and Tianjin Paper for 4,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>Silk Rises Uniformly</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the quoted prices for artificial silk continued to rise sharply. Prices for various goods outside the industry have been rising steadily recently. There is much speculation in the industry about whether the Central Trust Bureau will continue to supply silk next week, so sentiment is uniformly bullish. 120-count Tianqiao was quoted at 9,500 yuan, and Dongyang approached 10,000 yuan. However, there were no accurate reports for over-the-counter transactions between brokers. The market remains chaotic.</p>
<p>After the lifting of price controls on raw silk, supplies have not yet increased significantly. Due to the surge in artificial silk prices, sentiment in the industry has followed suit. Moreover, with the opening of foreign trade, the silk weaving industry is eager to replenish supplies. People are buying as soon as they see silk for sale, regardless of price. The trend is still that demand exceeds supply. D-grade 78 yuan has increased from over 9,000 yuan to 11,200 yuan. Premium small lots are quoted at 11,000 yuan. There is no news of other transactions.</p>
<p>Due to the rising cost of raw materials, silk satin has followed suit. Factories are selling very little, and buyers are trying hard to purchase. Retail stores on the street have sold a lot during the price restriction period and have been continuing to replenish stocks in recent days, so the market continues to be active. Huaqiang bedding has risen to 5,500 yuan, and other goods such as Dawei呢 have also risen uniformly.</p>
<h3>China Farmers Bank Begins to Handle Emergency Loans for Winter Cultivation</h3>
<p>In order to increase production and regulate food supply, the Farmers Bank of China has launched emergency loans for winter cultivation. It has formulated a loan plan and sent it to the Central Bank for approval. It is reported that the plan has been approved by the Central Bank's Loan Placement Committee, and the Agricultural Bank will begin processing it next week.

(7) Capital Lending and Interest: 90% will be lent at the Central Bank’s lending rate. The loan interest rate is 2.8% per month. (8) Loan Period: Nine months.

<h3>### Title Copying</h3>
<p>— Yi Jun</p>
<p>When schools hold exams, students always ask when they receive the paper: "Should we copy the title?" The answer is uncertain. Some teachers say to copy, others say not to. Encountering a teacher who says it's unnecessary, one can certainly not copy the title, but copying it doesn't hurt either. However, encountering a teacher who says to copy, not copying it becomes a bit of a problem. Therefore, an experienced student who has been through many exams knows that whether they ask or not, it's always safer to copy the title.</p>
<p>A scholar once said: "Life is a constant examination." I think this is very true. For example, talking to someone is an examination of language, knowledge, and understanding; buying things is an examination of discernment, choice, and calculation; eating is testing whether your tongue can taste, your teeth can chew, your throat can swallow, and your stomach can digest, and so on; walking is testing whether your feet can lift, your eyes can recognize traffic lights, and your brain can distinguish directions; a worker is tested on whether they can create certain kinds of objects; a farmer is tested on what products they can harvest; a merchant is tested on how much profit they can gain; an official, if good, is tested on how much benefit they can bring to the public, if bad, is tested on how skillful their corruption is.</p>
<p>Life is a constant examination, truly.</p>
<p>Then, does the examination of life need a title?</p>
<p>In Aesop's Fables, there is a story of a wolf eating a lamb. The gist of the story is:</p>
<p>One day, a lamb went to a stream to drink water and happened to meet a wolf, who was eager to eat the lamb but had no reason. So he said sternly, "How dare you! You dare to muddy the clear water in my stream! How am I supposed to drink it?"</p>
<p>The lamb was shocked and hurriedly protested, "You are standing upstream, and I am standing downstream. Even if I dirtied the water, it wouldn't flow back to you!"</p>
<p>The wolf then changed his tune, "Even if that's the case, you're still a bad egg. I heard you were secretly scolding me last year..."</p>
<p>At this time, the lamb cried out, "Mr. Wolf, that's a real injustice! I wasn't even born last year!"</p>
<p>The wolf had another reason. He bared his sharp teeth, roaring, "Hmph, you rascal, if it wasn't you who scolded me, then it was your father! In any case, you deserve to die!" He pounced and ate the poor lamb.</p>
<p>In the above story, the reasons the wolf gave were the title for him eating the lamb. With a title, the act of eating the lamb became justified. Whether the content matched the title was of no concern to him.</p>
<p>Many people are like wolves. Zheng Zhuang Gong of the Spring and Autumn period deliberately wanted to expel his younger brother, so he indulged him as much as possible, deliberately providing him with all kinds of conveniences to "commit many unrighteous deeds," until "Uncle finished accumulating resources, prepared armor and weapons, equipped soldiers and chariots, and was about to attack Zheng, and his mother was about to open the city gate for him," only then did he say, "It is permissible!" (meaning: there is a title now.) Thus, "he defeated Duan at Yan."</p>
<p>However, the difference between many people and Zheng Zhuang Gong is minimal.</p>
<h3>### Mr. Has Wine and Food</h3>
<p>— Da Jun</p>
<p>It sounds like a myth, but it's a fact, a moving fact: some elementary school teachers can still eat good white rice and delicious dishes every day.</p>
<p>Yesterday, my aunt came from the countryside. She told me about the education situation in the countryside, especially the meals of elementary school teachers. ×× Temple is a small town belonging to Nanhui County. When private elementary school teachers in Shanghai were already enacting a tragic drama of hunger and cold, elementary school teachers in ×× Temple seemed to be enacting a comedy, although it was still heartbreaking!</p>
<p>School started, and the children in the countryside seemed very happy, even though their fathers and brothers could no longer buy them new schoolbags or foreign leather balls. The tuition fees in rural schools have always been much lower than in urban areas, but even the small amount of tuition fees is a price paid with hard work and sweat in the eyes of farmers. The clever teachers of ×× Elementary School made the following agreement with the students' parents: each student would provide the teacher and school worker with a meal for one day per semester, and parents who were too poor would be exempt. The meal procedure was as follows: a few days in advance, the student on duty would be informed, the student would tell their parents, and on that day, all the teachers and school workers would set off. But unexpectedly, the villagers were truly respectful of teachers and valued the Way. They went to town early in the morning, bought big fish and meat, and even hung wine bottles beside the basket. Such a feast was almost like a holiday.</p>
<p>They had three meals a day. Breakfast was picked up from the parents on duty by the school worker, and for lunch and dinner, everyone would travel the five or six miles, regardless of wind, rain, or sunshine. ... When my aunt spoke of this, I seemed to see the farmers' sincere attitude and kind faces; but I also understood the teachers' sorrowful feelings!</p>
<p>My aunt also told me, "The villagers are very attentive! Before leaving, they would say, 'There's no good food, teachers, please excuse us! Is it Wu Quanfa's turn tomorrow?' Several teachers who received this kind of courtesy for the first time blushed."</p>
<h3>### Miscellaneous Poems on the Lake</h3>
<p>— Shi Shufan</p>
<p>Visiting Yue Fei's Tomb Late, Osmanthus Flowers Scented Profusely</p>
<p>Crows croak in reverence, what words do guests offer? Stiff southern branches and northern branches, Regret is often felt for what happens after death, shaking heads, writing poems of the present, the integrity of that time was unparalleled, our loyalty is also close to foolish, changes happen in the world the tomb is still green, allowing the wind to blow all over the sky.</p>
<p>Late osmanthus emits a clear fragrance on the high walls, I take it in with my nose and feel a bitterness in my heart, as a guest I am startled that autumn is already old, Facing the duke, I lament that there is no one like him! Who can repay the endless wishes of the East Sea? Thinking of the casual spring in Southern Capital. The stubborn iron eyebrows can speak: In my eyes, these youths are not as good as Qin Hui.</p>
<p>Passing South Screen</p>
<p>Withered ink flies disorderly, crows on the trees, old friend died in hundreds of battles in Changsha, the sun slants, passing the Honglai Mountain House, wheat flowers blooming reflected in plain. (The building is on the site of the Leifeng Pagoda ruins, I used to sit there with Mengsun drinking tea, now it is destroyed, my old friend revolted in Hengyang, and it has been nearly five years. That day his wife traveled with him.)</p>
<p>Boating on the Lake</p>
<p>Old grudges dissipated like smoke, a young woman sings the water chestnut gathering song again, Fish froth floats on the mossy clumps, a stench, weeping beside the oars, many rotten bones.</p>
<h3>### The Cost of World War III</h3>
<p>— Mao Yi</p>
<p>War is a costly and wasteful undertaking. In World War II, the United States alone spent 330 billion US dollars, and at the height of the war in 1944, the annual war expenditure reached as high as 90 billion US dollars. If World War III breaks out, the lives and property lost will certainly be even more considerable. The October issue of "Reader's Digest" published an article titled "The Price of Another War," in which the figures listed focus on the United States, but can also be extrapolated to estimate the total cost of the next war—if it is unavoidable.</p>
<p>Military Expenses—Assuming that the next war will arm 12 million people and purchase the same amount of military supplies as in 1944, it will cost 143 billion US dollars a year at current market prices. If this war lasts as long as World War II, the total cost will reach 540 billion US dollars. This is still calculated at the current value of the US dollar, and if the US dollar continues to depreciate, it will be more than this amount.</p>
<p>Military Supplies—The price of steel has risen by 37 percent since August 1945. The price of gasoline has more than doubled since then. The price of rubber is fluctuating wildly. The cost of raw materials and finished products in any possible new war will be at least 50 percent higher than before.</p>
<p>Lives—It is impossible to predict how many lives will be sacrificed if war breaks out between the United States and the Soviet Union. However, exceeding the number of casualties in World War II is beyond doubt. In World War II, 294,000 American soldiers were killed in action, and 670,000 were injured. The casualty rate on the European battlefield can be learned from Germany's experience. The German army lost 5 million killed and missing in World War II, and another 4 million were injured, most of whom were lost on the front lines against the Soviet army.</p>
<p>Resources—The United States consumed more than 5 billion tons of the best minerals and about 8 billion barrels of gasoline in World War II. The next war will consume even more resources. By the end of the war, the United States will become a "have-nothing" country.</p>
<p>Freedom—In order to control manpower, laws may be enacted to "join the war or work," applicable to people under the age of 65. Strikes are illegal, wages are controlled, and occupations cannot be changed arbitrarily. Rationing and price controls are implemented. The production of civilian goods stops, and military contracts have priority everywhere.</p>
<p>Aftermath—World War II increased debt to 220 billion US dollars, and interest, veterans' benefits, and pensions became a heavy burden on the people. If World War III breaks out, the debt will reach 300 billion US dollars. Interest and veterans' benefits and pensions will naturally be even more enormous.</p>
<h3>### Good Things Approaching</h3>
<p>— Lu Shi</p>
<p>On November 14th, Mr. Pan Gongzhan's son, Brother Weixin, got married. I fill in a short poem to congratulate him.</p>
<p>October is a good time, Old Bin's face is filled with joy, Your son is matched with a beautiful bride, fulfilling your wishes. Don't speak of the old family's reputation for throwing fruit, his talent surpasses others, in an instant a good night, try to paint new eyebrows.</p>
<h3>### God of Wealth</h3>
<p>— Shi Ming</p>
<p>I went to a printing house by chance to find a friend. I saw that they were printing a colorful picture, in the middle of which was a portrait of an ancient warrior with a dark complexion and a beard around his cheeks, holding a steel whip in his hand, with a tiger squatting beside him. I didn't know who the person in the portrait was. If he was Wu Song, who fought tigers, the scene didn't look like tiger fighting, and the tiger wasn't baring its teeth and claws. Who was the person in the picture? I couldn't help but ask my friend. My friend told me that this was the God of Wealth, for the reason that the New Year was approaching, so they were doing a bit of speculative business, printing them in preparation for people to buy them and paste them in their halls or on their doors. I couldn't help but feel some doubt. The God of Wealth should be holding gold bars and banknotes, with an abacus and ledger beside him, and he should be refined and elegant. The picture is so different, it's really a bit baffling! My friend also told me that there are two types of Gods of Wealth, civil and military. The one in the picture is the military God of Wealth. I seemed to understand a little, but I still felt that it wasn't quite right, so I said: That's right! The civil God of Wealth earns money with an abacus and ledger. The military God of Wealth is a green forest hero, so he should be holding a pistol. My friend laughed when he heard this, saying that I only knew one thing but not the other, saying that this picture has a special subtlety, and told me to think about it.</p>
<p>I sat silently beside him, smoked half a cigarette, and remembered. In this day and age, to get rich, you must first hoard goods. Those who hoard paper are called "paper tigers," those who deal in gold and foreign exchange are called "gold tigers," and the government cracking down on these hoarders is called "fighting tigers," so the God of Wealth and tigers have a considerable relationship. The God of Wealth has tigers around him, and those who kowtow to the God of Wealth are willing to submit to the God of Wealth and be tigers at his feet. The God of Wealth raises tigers, so the God of Wealth must protect the tigers, holding a steel whip, ready to resist those who fight tigers.</p>
<p>My friend clapped his hands and said I was right when he heard what I said.</p>
<h3>### Pigpen Direction</h3>
<p>In this time when public school employees are crying from hunger and cold, schools are closed here, and workers are lazy there, with no difference between north and south, and universal grief in all directions, I suddenly saw a telegram from Nanjing that the government will issue 35 yuan per person for winter clothing expenses this month, which is considered a thoughtful gesture from the government. The mention of "winter clothing" is full of poetic meaning, "everywhere the sound of knives and rulers hurrying to make winter clothes," "how can I get thousands of mansions to shelter all the poor scholars in the world and make them happy," those who read these lines have always felt a surge of sympathy, especially with the reality of the approaching harsh winter before their eyes, and the cries of hardship ringing throughout the land. Seeing these two words, who wouldn't feel a thousand emotions!</p>
<p>The "winter clothing expenses" is a good intention, but if we talk about the facts, let me briefly describe the clothing prices in the former capital. The cheapest clothing markets are in Tianqiao and the small markets in the east, west, north cities. A thin quilt costs 90 gold yuan, a cotton robe that is six or seven tenths new costs 70 or 80 yuan, and a small padded jacket and cotton trousers cost 30 yuan or so. The goods in the so-called "used clothing stalls" and "old clothing sheds" are mostly old (sourced from pawnshops and drum stalls), or cheaply made new items, so the prices are cheaper. If you buy new materials from silk and cloth stores and have tailors make new clothes, the labor and material costs will be three or four times or six or seven times higher than "used clothing."</p>
<p>A coat at the used clothing stall that looks decent (thick enough to keep out the cold) costs 150 or 160 yuan, and leather clothes and leather tubes were the main items on the market at this time last year. Fox, sheep, mink, everything was available. An ordinary sheepskin robe with a completely new lining and clean fur and bottom cost no more than 700,000 or 800,000 yuan, and a fox tube with a satin surface that was eight or nine tenths new cost no more than 2 million yuan. But at this time this year, there are only a few leather goods stalls, and in a vast public market, only worn-out sheepskin and smelly dog and wolf skin can be seen. If there is a slightly neat sheepskin robe that is six or seven tenths new, it costs 300 or 400 gold yuan, and people rush to buy it. Fox fur is not seen for three or five days, and if it is seen, it is being sold by one or two women who are selling it because their families are in urgent need of money, but the asking price is always 1 million or 2 million yuan, and who dares to inquire! Therefore, even if there is such goods, it is difficult to sell.</p>
<p>Sheepskin is easy to sell but there is a shortage of goods, because leather robes can save coal, so those who have them at home are unwilling to sell them. If there are any for sale in the market, they are snatched up immediately. Stallholders have goods in hand, hoarding and waiting for an opportunity, hiding them and not showing them. Therefore, the serious situation of "winter clothing" this year is no less than that of food!</p>
