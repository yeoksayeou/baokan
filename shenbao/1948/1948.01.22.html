<h3 id="c24">日本廢除「四黨政策協定」以後 <a href="#c24" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e24" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">24</a></h3>
<p>今年的一月，成為了日本的政治季節。此月中，有兩個對日本政局頗具影響的大會，有關片山內閣的成敗。一是十六日舉行的社會黨第三屆全體大會，一是二十一日召開的第二次國會。社會黨為日本的第一黨，該黨委員長片山　即為現政府的首撥。該黨自去年四月選舉勝利以來，內有左右派的分裂鬥爭，以遭自由黨吉田與民主黨幣原派的襲擊，致片山內閣的施政舉棋不定，一般輿論及民意測騐，都推斷片山內閣難渡一月危機，該黨大會在人事上政策上必發生重大變化，甚至可能陷片山於進退維谷之境。十九日該黨大會，左翼以二十一票之差，推翻作為片山聯珍味政府計劃基礎之「四黨政策協定」，國內外與論認為這是片山內閣的致命打擊，民主黨自由黨更認這是社會黨的重大事件，片山內閣的歸趨殊堪注目。無欵的，這重大事件是社會黨政策上的變化，將影響第二次國會的進行。但這事件的眞象如何？片山內閣是否立即會退却？實在値得注意。</p>
<p>日本社會黨是代表勤勞大衆的政黨，羣衆基礎建築在多數的工農。該黨服　社會主義，確守民主自由的原則，自日本　降以後，組織擴充，力量雄厚。去年實行新憲，全國舉行普選，該黨擊敗極左的共產黨，礦城　右翼的自由黨和中間傾右的民上黨協同黨等，在地方議會（都道府）取得四〇八席，在中央議會的參院取得四八席，衆院取得一四三席，躍升為日本的第一黨。依新黨規定，內閣總理必須由多數黨推選於是該黨委員長片山哲，便在衆院多數票支持下出任新憲政府的「平民首相」，到現在尙在滿一年。當時片山的登塲，一方面由於社會黨全體的擁護，另方面則受民主黨蘆田派和協同黨的支持。現在片山內閣陣容，便是以社會·民主·協同三黨為中心的。</p>
<p>依片山當時的抱負，實施新憲的政府，應為無共產黨的聯合政府。所以他於人事安排之前，曾多方爭取自由黨吉田茂的合作，幷不惜將社會黨在選舉前所發表的政策，以及選舉揭曉後所擬四黨共同政策，作最大讓步，於五月十六日成立了所謂「四黨政策協定」，計分下列九項：　為突破經濟危機，在必要時得斟酌現行經濟組織，擬定綜合計劃，實施國家管理；　為增加生產，採取超重點產業政策，在必要時，對重要基礎產業，施行國家管理。惟其管理，廢除官僚統制方式，而以民主方式行之；　產業復興必須在企業家與勞工人員自動積極協力之下行之；　為克服通貨膨脹，採取健全財政措置，並在必要時施行金融統制；　凡利用通貨膨脹或黑市交易以致富者，政府對之增加其特別負担，惟凍結新圓存款或國債停止付息方案，均予廢止；　置工資及物價於嚴格統制下，而對日用必需品之匱乏部份，實施嚴格之配制度，確保肥料農具等農村必需物資之供應，以謀食糧之增產，並從速改善徵購制度，以謀徵購定額完全獲得；　為再建產業及安定民生，徵底撲滅黑市交易，並完全改善海陸運輸力；　鑑於危機之克服繁於全國國民救國意識之自覺，故對促進國民道德之昂揚，及文敎之刷新，特加注意。本九項政策，多偏向經濟方面，而其重點則在重要產業的國家化，金融統制和工資物價管制，和對勤勞大衆施行保護，對暴當予以取締與排緊等，惟不贊成凍結新圓存款或國債停止付息一項，勢在保護少數的財富旣得者，這是為了對保守勢力的妥協。這個經濟政策，旣非完全的社會主義，又非自由的資本主義。如譽之為改良社會主義的改良也可，譽之為資本主義的修正亦可。自由黨吉田，和民主黨幣原，對「四黨政策協定」內容，幷無多大意見，彼輩所堅持的是人事的安排，結果協定成立，自由黨和幣原，幷未參加聯合政府，但這協定一直成為片山內閣所依照的路綫。</p>
<p>這次社會黨大會，推翻了「四黨政策協定」，說明該黨左翼勢力的雄壯，對片山和西尾末廣施行新的威脅。社會黨本有左右翼之分，而右派又有急進緩進之別。「日農」在左翼加藤勘十之手，「全農」領導權利則為平野力三黨握。平野為右翼之急進，前任片山內閣之農相，因與內閣書記官長西尾失和被罷免，平野乃號召「全農」中堅及協同黨少數派，另創勘勞新黨運動，意圖分化社會黨；近更發動衆院社會黨議員十六人脫黨，希翼支解第一黨在衆院地位，一度掀起嚴重的政治波浪。片山西尾為緊急處置，於社會黨大會前夕，對平野施行整備，幷通吿衆院轉知平野，於廿一日以前自動辭職。這次社會黨大會，平野問題和「日農」「全農」合併問題，列為主要議題，可能是該黨內部崛起的反西尾運動，而「四黨政策協定」的決定廢除，正說明該黨多數予西尾重大反　的勝利，這個事件的發展，必然造成片山內閣的困難。</p>
<p>不過，這不能立即說明片山內閣即陷崩潰的邊緣。其一·「四黨政策協定」乃是聯合政府的政策協定，並非完全的政黨協定·片山內閣不必要堅持這　定，甚至可能另訂名符其實的三黨政策協定·事實上，片山與蘆田等正硏討新政策，以應付盟國對日和會，去年的「四黨政策協定」，在情勢上早巳失去效用；其二·這次社會黨大會在政策決定上，左翼是勝利了，但在人事變更上，有翼捲土重來，依然取得了該黨的領導權，這說明左翼的企圖巳被粉碎。據十九日晚該黨選舉結果，除片山復當選為委員長外，右翼候選人淺沼稻次郎敗左翼候選人加藤勘十，而當選為該黨書記長，中立派候選人中崎敏擊敗左翼候選人田中松月，當選為司庫，主持該黨財政會計。要之，在翼左人事之握得領導權，正是社會黨右翼强大的說明，片山便在這危機中渡過了一種難關。今後一月內，日本政局的變化，要看第二次國會的發展了。</p>
<p>片山如何應付新國會的暗潮？他可能提出新政策爭取國會的支援，國會如支持新政策，政府便可穩定下去，如果失敗，他可能解散國會，重新舉行普選，讓民意來抉擇政府的命運。</p>

<p>〔中央社南京廿一日電〕董顯九局長廿一日在記者招待會席問題稱：</p>

<p>（答）政黨提名捕充辦法，規定黨員競選，必須經過政黨提名，始得為候選人，正所以保障一般公民之被選舉權，並為歐美民主國家之通例，與我國憲法並不抵觸。</p>
<p>（問）政府自瀋陽撤退若干人員之原因，可否見吿。</p>
<p>（答）目前所撤退者，僅限於瀋陽一帶資委會之技術人員之眷屬，東北境內若干重要工礦陷入匪手或被破壞以後，多數技術人員巳吿開散，同時國內其他地區之工廠，正亟需此項人才，故有關當局巳決定在需要時務上項人　調至其他地區工作。</p>

<p>〔本報南京廿一日電〕國防部新聞局廿一日發表一月十五日至廿一日之一週戰局透視，全文如次：</p>
<p>這一週的全般戰局，比上週略趨沉寂，這是由於全面的匪軍，因為遭受了國軍打擊以第和，在東北的正等修改整頓補充，在華北的遭受了華北勦匪總部的壓力，只好依托太行山脈的掩護新掘的地道鼠穴，偶爾偷襲游擊外，主力也是龜廢動，尤以華中的劉伯承，陳毅，陳賡各匪到處化整為零，避免主力決戰。晉南的匪軍以四萬多人的兵力，連他們自稱根據地的中條山都守不住，紛紛逃避北竄。劉匪伯　的所部亦殘留着二·三·六·三個縱隊，在大別山區分股流亡。因之，一週來除了國軍的牛掃蕩戰之外，各戰塲還沒有大規模的接觸。</p>
<p>但是這種暫時的平靜，是不會很久的，這正是匪首毛澤東所指示各匪軍，要他們「保存實力」，「避實就虛」，「獲得休息」，可是他不知道國軍是不容許匪喘氣的。</p>
<p>單就新年以來，我們所得的各方戰果統計，據不完全的報，從十二月下旬到本月中旬，東北方面已在遼河兩岸區域及遼南兩方面就打垮了匪軍一·二·三·六·七·八·十共七個縱隊的兵力，現在已不能蠢動。</p>
<p>在華北方面，從十二月旬到本月中旬就傷斃投降四千一百多名。華中戰塲，一個月的統計，共傷斃匪三萬一千多名，投降俘虜四千二百多名（預東預西兩地戰果還未計入），就可想見匪的流竄戰術，仍然免不了重大的犧牲，現在匪為提高巳頹喪的士氣，又在向各部匪軍幹部打氣，喊他們「準備反攻」，「保存巳得　實」和「擴大參軍」的口號，打算繼續作困獸之鬥。</p>
<p>在上述國軍的搜勦追捕中，預西的民團英勇的表現了「保家鄕」「打奸匪」的狀烈戰績，在鄧縣以四千多人的民團抵抗賡匪部兩個縱隊和加上劉匪伯承逃去合股的第十從隊殘部，共兩萬四千多人的進攻，達十二天之久，在本月十六日才向去接應的國軍和民團會師，向鄧縣西北的孟家樓等處安全轉進。匪軍所喊的「消滅民團」，並未達到目的，但在進犯鄧縣的時候，反折兵六千人之多，這可證明中國的農民對共匪鬥爭的情緒已到了什麼程度。</p>
<p>總括上週的全面勦匪軍事，我們可以看出勦匪的戰局，巳漸漸進入新的階段。</p>

<p>〔路透社柏林廿日電〕柏林四强盟國管制委員會，今日在此舉行四强倫敦外長會議失敗後之第一次會議。據可靠方面透露：美國代表團在會中提出弗蘭克福關於英美合併區經濟行政新措施的協定，獻聯代表團即宣讀預擬的聲明，指該協定違背彼茨坦協定要求廢止，但並未表示蘇方此項要求等於最後通牒。美軍總司令克萊將軍於全體會議結束時，要求舉行每一代表團至多出席四人之限制性的會議，此會歷時僅十分鐘，由克萊將軍提出實行全德幣制改革的要求，今日之會由英軍總司令羅勃森中將任主席，會塲空氣誠摯，盟國代表團人士事後均表示開會情形，與以前歷次會議絕無不同。法軍總司令寇尼許將軍，以另有事務，於會議結束前先告辭，由副司令代理繼續參加會議。開會之初，先由克萊將軍報告弗蘭克福協定之大概，並聲明在弗蘭克福舉行的會議，僅涉經濟問題，與政治無關。渠允諾不久將向盟管會提出協定之詳細內容。</p>
<h3 id="c44">美軍總司令會後飛華府 <a href="#c44" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e44" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">44</a></h3>
<p>克萊述畢，蘇軍總司令沙科羅夫斯基元師起立先向克萊所作之報告致謝，然後即取一長共兩頁打字機書就之胖明，宣　蘇聯對於該協定的意見，說蘇聯代表團認爲弗蘭克福的協定，爲趨向分裂德國，建立西德國家的更進一步的行動，進行之際完全忽視盟管會的機構，實爲違背波茨坦協定。他並指出該一英美區協協定，並無德國民主份子的支持或參加，使有德國非民主份子的參預，如德國社會民主黨領袖舒瑪赫，德境蘇聯區基督民主黨領袖凱賽（最近經蘇當局罷黜者），英國區基督民主黨領袖阿特諾爾等。（事實上此三人均未參加弗蘭克福之會）最後他說蘇聯之要求，在停止實行該一違背波茨坦協定及盟管會協議的英美合併區計劃。沙科羅夫斯基發言歷時十分鐘，態度安詳，甚爲客氣。至此寇尼許將軍有事先行告退，渠於致謝克萊將軍的報告後，並允諾將轉達法國政府。英軍總司令羅勃森中將繼聲明，克萊將軍之聲明，係代表英美所發表，他說弗關克福宣言分作兩部，一部爲一般性的聲明，一部即爲由克萊宣布之新建議的內容，兩者均爲英美合併區英美併局的共同聲明。克萊將軍最後復起立聲明，否認合併區的新建議，違背波茨坦協定，並允諾不久將向盟管會提出合併區決議的細則內容。</p>
<p>〔路透社伯林廿日電〕德境美軍總司令克萊將軍，於參加四强盟；制委員會之會議畢僅廿分鐘，即匆遽自柏林登專機前往華盛頓。</p>
<h3 id="c45">要求英美退出柏林說　蘇軍司令已否認　對英美區蘇將發動攻勢 <a href="#c45" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e45" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">45</a></h3>
<p>〔中央社柏林廿日合衆電〕蘇軍司令在盟國管制委會重要會議上，說明蘇聯政策將如何驟然轉變時，否認報紙所稱蘇聯將要求西方盟國退出柏林之說。</p>
<p>〔路透社柏林廿一日電〕此間關係方面相信，蘇聯昨在盟管會會議中對英美合併區之新決議標出抗議後，蘇方報紙將繼之對「西德國家」發動强力攻勢。</p>
<p>而社會統一黨主特之「德國人民大會」，同時亦必將發動「統一德國」的宣傳，若蘇聯要求之停止執行英美合併區新決議遭遇英美方面的斷然拒絕，則蘇聯或將考慮採取若實施東德幣制改革，及要求西方盟國退出柏林等之措施。惟此等措施，當俟蘇聯諷　局勢已惡化至不可收拾的地步時始行採取。「德國人民大會」，將於今年三月之大會中要求舉行全德公民投票，決定德國之統一。據接近社會統一黨之人稱，沙科羅夫斯基元帥可採的比較溫和的行動，或爲拖延時間，然蘇聯雖未提出最後通牒，但已提出具體而肯定的要求，預料沙科羅夫斯基在今後之盟管會會議中，或將再提其要求，並表示英美合併區之袂議如能修改，蘇聯亦未始不願妥協，彼時英美如仍表示拒絕，則蘇聯當毫不躊躇以宣布其反措施矣。</p>

<p>〔路透社華盛頓廿日電〕共和黨外交顧問杜勒斯　日出席參院外交委員會陳述關於歐洲復興方案之意見，他說：歐洲自由國家，受戰爭造成的嚴重創傷後，正在逐漸復元的狀態中，而蘇聯領袖，則使用除去戰爭以外的種種方法，使成爲致命的創傷，除非由美國協助此等自由國家恢復健康，恐蘇聯領袖的計劃終將獲得成功。</p>
<p>馬歇爾方案的目標即在此一方案，匪特在協助他人出於困境，亦所以維護美國本身的利益。蘇聯領袖相信歐洲自由制度已在搖搖欲墜的狀態中，祗須輕輕一推，則可將其推入深淵，共產黨正以準備的姿態，坐觀一隅，願意供給這種打擊。歐洲的政洽不團結，已引起經濟上的動亂，西歐國家包括德國在內，茍能有關稅同盟貨幣同盟等等的組織，再輔以美國供給的援助物資，即可使目前的窮困狀態，一變而爲康樂狀態。同時西歐國家亦須有適當的政治團結，使其成爲足以應付任何緊急狀態的堅固陣綫，因此西歐國家，宜在聯合國機構之內，訂立類似西半球聯防公約的區城公約，西歐團結，乃馬歇爾方案的耍點之一，亦爲蘇聯領袖所以加以抨擊的理由·蘇聯領袖深知分裂的西歐，及絕望的經濟狀况，可使其人民接受蘇聯的意志。反之，二億五千萬團結的西歐人民，則絕對不是任何勢力所能征服。杜勒斯繼又述及西德問題，要求明確規定西德在歐洲復興方案中所担任的任務，他指出蘇聯已具有某種確定波蘭與東德關係的計劃，祇待和會的批准，因此東德及波關人民對於前途深具信心，因而得以進行其經濟計劃。就法·荷蘭·比利時等國言，其戰前經濟與德國有密切聯繫，因此彼等應該知道魯爾等區未來的狀態。</p>
<h3 id="c50">英美法下週舉行會議　將討論西德行政　法代表對此已完全同意 <a href="#c50" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e50" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">50</a></h3>
<p>〔路透社倫敦廿一日電〕消息靈通方面稱，英美法三强就西德行政舉行之討論，下週即可在倫敦舉行。法國對此項談判之舉行已表同意，法大使馬西格里今日自巴黎返倫敦時，即可携來法政府之正式同意，英政府與美國就舉行此一會議進行之會談，尚未完成，英國認爲目前討論英美合併區之行政計劃，尤其是擴大合併區德國經濟委員會職權範圍的六點計劃，必甚有用處。</p>
<h3 id="c51">德境美政府　應歸國務院指揮 <a href="#c51" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e51" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">51</a></h3>
<p>美國在德境佔領政府，對於歐洲復興計劃之供給，在任何其他歐洲國之上，爲便利執行此項任務起見，美佔領政府，應迅速歸國務部指揮。西德在陸軍控制期內，馬歇爾即無法在平等的基礎與貝文·皮杜爾共擬西德經濟政策，故此項狀態，應迅速予以糾正，杜勒斯最後又曰：美國不願援助歐洲，後者將陷入外國獨栽制之下，蘇聯即將席捲全歐。彼時美國所需要的軍事設備費，若與馬歇爾方案支出的費用相較，後者不過「一袋花生米」而已。</p>

<p>華沙九國會議的消息傳遍歐洲，第一個反應最緊張的國家是法蘭西，這不僅爲法國共產黨的「大員」杜可拉斯，路遠迢迢去華沙出席，而實際是打擊法國現政權的一個有力因素。第二次世界大戰結束以後，法蘭西在內政上是多黨聯立的局而，最初是共產黨參加內開其後，共產黨雖被排斥於內閣之外，但在法國國民大會）即原來的衆議院）內，共產黨仍然是擁有雄厚的力量。在外交上，法國不僅是美蘇的橋樑，而且幾乎是「唯一」的橋樑。在國際會議塲上，莫洛托夫那種剛愎不凡的氣概，似乎祗有對皮杜爾，還講三分「賣帳」。最近，美國前任國務卿貝爾納斯的大作「坦白眞言」在前鋒論壇報的，「巴黎版」上按日刋登，內中有好幾段講到雅爾達會議當年的舊事，當年史達林莫洛托夫對於法國的蔑視，使如今許多法國讀者，爲之驚訝不置。</p>
<p>平心地講，從希特勒投降到現在這一個階段之間，法國的外交，應該算是最成功的外交。法國到現在還閙着通貨膨脹，殖民地的戰爭，到現在還渺無期窮工，業和農業的復員，不僅趕不上英國，而且較比利時，荷蘭，差得很遠，在巴黎街頭看法國的國計民生，幾乎是　團漆黑。但是，皮杜爾坐在國際會議塲中，誰都不敢不相信：他是五强之一。戰爭結束以來，巴黎舉行的國際會議最多，在任何一次國際會議之中，美蘇翻了臉，最後多半是用皮杜爾的折衷建議收塲，如果我們用中國文字來表達這一種涵意，可以稱之爲「騎牆外交」，也可以稱之爲「橋樑外交」。</p>
<p>外交的態度，多多少少是反映內政的機構的。我在今年四月間的通訊中曾經說過：自從戴高樂將軍離開了法國的總統府以後，在法國的政治軀殼上，有一個實際的領導者，這個人叫做萊翁勃倫。我還說過：「在自由主義和極權主義，資本主義和共產主義，到沒有完全決裂，但也無法水乳融洽的時期，萊翁勃倫是一個必然的產物，雖然萊翁勃倫，在全世界祗有一個，但萊翁勃倫的化身，却有無數個……」。我在巴黎幾次會見過萊翁，他口口聲聲說他是：「眞正的馬克斯主義者」，但是他絕不是共產黨，尤其絕不是和莫斯科有關的共產黨。</p>
<p>萊翁勃倫是法蘭西社會黨的最高領導者從他和戴高樂翻臉到現在，法蘭西一直就是社會黨的天下。不僅是法國，全歐洲兩年來的局面，都是社會黨在東叫西鬧，英國的在朝黨，雖然名之爲「勞工」，實際却是最正牌的社會黨。今年夏天，歐洲社會黨的各國組織，在比利時京城舉行了一次會議，許多人稱之爲「第二國際的幽靈再現」，雖然他們並沒有沿用「第二國際」的招牌。但實際上，兩年來，整個歐洲的局面，介乎在美蘇兩强之間的橋標政治的運用，是第二國際的一手傑作。</p>
<p>九國共產黨的華沙會議，直截了當的打擊了所謂第二國際的幽靈，華沙共產黨宣言中，明白指斥萊翁勃倫·艾德禮·貝文·和法國的現任國務總理賴瑪迪，說他們盜竊社會主義的美名，做資本主養的「帮兇」。華沙會議以後不久，我從波蘭到法國，聽萊翁勃倫在昂哥萊姆城的演講，那位七十高齡的老政治家，漲紅了臉，破口大駡共產黨，他直截了當的分析常前的世界兩大集團，現况及將來，他尤其痛斥法國共產黨的事事聽命於莫斯科。</p>
<p>那次演講是在一個社會黨黨員授勛典禮上講的，萊翁勃倫特別强調了社會黨內部的團結，他說有此黨員，因爲受不住共產黨的甜言蜜語，同時因爲對社會主義的眞正認識不够，「最近顯得非常動搖」。有位法國同業偸偸告訴我：那是指的穆萊。穆萊現在是法國社會黨的左派首領，和賴瑪迪是對手，在社會黨的左右派之爭中，賴瑪迪出組了內閣，穆萊則出任了社會黨的中央秘書長。</p>
<p>沒有人告訴我：穆萊和共產黨合作的內情，大體而論，當共產黨的行動在走向極端的過程中，社會黨祇有兩條路可走：一條路是跟共產黨「合作」，合作到甚而把靈魂都出賣給他。波蘭社會黨的左派領袖，三十五歲的禿顯少年崔蘭克微契，就是這樣。我在華沙的逗留期中，曾經看崔蘭克微獎，一面跟共產消退「充份」的「合作」，一面又看他不檡一切手段，在社會黨內部「淸黨」。就社會黨的所謂左派而論，這條路也未始走不通的，因爲社會主義和共產主義，畢竟祇有一牆之隔，三十年前的「第二國際」的舊理論，雖在過去兩年間運用「美蘇橋樑」之間，還有小小功效，但是所謂社會黨的國際結合，到底還是空的。范登堡和康納利支配下的美國外交，不會來赤裸裸的講社會主義，而莫斯科對於國際共產黨的加强運用，却是一絲一毫從不茍且的。</p>
<p>然而穆萊並不是選的這條路，今天法國的局面，和地理歷史的因素，畢竟還沒有到波蘭那副田地。我到巴黎的時候，正是，城市鄉鎭普選投票的前夜，共產黨的一手傑作「羅工運動」，擴大到地道車的全體工人。據巴黎人說：地道車罷工，三十年來還是第一次，這條交通血管斷了，儘管再美的巴黎，也就成了死的一樣。國務總理賴瑪迪，動員了所有的軍用車，私人卡車，帮助維特交通，滿街都擁塞了車輪，呌一輪出租汽車，過一座橋，動輒要等上二三十分鐘，脚踏軍全城大出動，警察急得滿頭大汗，維持不了那種難看的交通規則。共產黨天天偸著限暗笑：「看這社會黨內閣，還能够維持著幾天？」</p>
<p>那幾天，塲面確實够熟鬧，東山再起的戴高樂，在阿爾及爾的大雨滂沱中，被羣衆歡呼「萬歲」！早幾天，戴高樂在巴黎文山跑馬塲演講，大駡共產，咀咒分贓式的「民主政治」，批評第四共和的現行憲法，大意和他在斯屈拉斯堡的「快蘭西人民大結合」的成立宣言，完全一樣，有一點倒是非常新頴的：在斯屈拉斯堡，他很少講到外國，還次在巴黎文山跑馬塲的演講，對美國和杜魯門總統，頌楊備至。</p>
<p>使我發生興趣的，是演講以後的那些零星材料，戴高樂自己的報紙上說：聽衆有七十萬人，共產黨的「人道報」上說：聽衆約五萬人，法國人之沒有數字觀念，令我驚奇！有一張陸軍機關報上說：聽衆五十萬人，警察局的報告，則說有十五萬人參加聽講。據警察局的發言人說，他們是根據跑馬塲的席次算的，因此比較來得準確！</p>
<p>就在那個時候，皮杜爾從美國回來了！巴黎「人道報」上，用大標題寫出：「雙手空空的皮杜爾回來了！」另外有一天，共產黨的「人道報」，稱皮杜爾爲「杜魯門的聽差」尤其幽默的，是他們報道皮杜爾雙手空空回來的消息隔壁，却用顯著的大字，寫出：「蘇俄一百五十萬噸麥子，正候船啓運來法！」</p>
<p>皮杜爾永遠是那副「慢呑吞」和「從容不迫」的樣十，他在飛機塲上說：「馬歇爾援歐計劃，是美國的政治智慧的表現，是美國的慷慨與輸將，是這次戰爭打敗了人類公敵以後，締造人類永久和平的基石，因之，我深信，馬歇爾援歐計劃，必將實現！」</p>
<p>在巴黎冬季運動塲，MRP民衆共和運動黨的競選演說會上，皮杜爾講了許多令人笑痛肚子的幽默，他說：「共產黨講我雙手空空的從美國回來，但是請問有那一個是雙手滿滿的從另一個國家歸來？」他說：今天法國的生存權利，沒有被人否認，「從白宮到紐約百老匯路，和我接觸的美國人，沒有一個不同情帮助我們法蘭西。」皮杜爾還呼籲共產黨，不要以俄國人的眼光來看法國，應以法國人的心境來看法國。他相信：法國得道多助，在今天冬天，一定可以獲得美國的麥子，煤炭，和工業原料，「至於詳細的交涉，外交應守機密，恕我不能在道裹洩漏！」羣衆爲他熱烈的鼓掌。</p>
<p>民衆共和運動，那天是唱的「雙簧」，皮杜爾演講以後，副國務總理　噤，接着大駡了一通戴高樂，他說：共產黨的恐怖和「法蘭西人民大結合」的無却取閙，同樣爲法國人民之敵。他說：「戴高樂誠然偉大，因此，他心目中，也祇有他一個人偉大！」聽衆大笑起來！</p>
<p>但是，選舉結束了，民衆共和運動（ＭＲP）這逢到空前的慘敗，共產黨和戴高樂，都勝利了。這些象徵着什麽呢？象徵對現狀不滿，對「橋　政治」的懕倦。急躁的法國人，也許在想：全世界瑞在分成了兩個集團，政治體制和政治形態，「不歸於楊，便歸於墨」，因此，法蘭西也得選定一條路來走！</p>
<p>大勢是不是這樣呢？聽明的賴瑪油首相要人民冷靜的思考，思考常前的法國環境；跟一個大國走偏鋒呢？還是保持法國木位走中鋒？議會一次二次都投了信任票，（第二次是三百對二百八十票）社會黨內閣依然長存，萊翁勃倫的「騎牆哲學」「橋楔哲學」和英國的拉茨基哲學，依然金碧輝映於英法海峽的兩岸！</p>
<p>這一個局面能拖延多久？誰都不敢曲斷。共產國際復活以後，莫斯科的作風，一定會更「刀快頭光」，保加利亞的佩得科夫，送上了吊台，羅馬尼亞的馬尼玉，進入了囹圄，彼蘭的米可安契，七月間，在我的波蘭通訊上，還被一再提到過的，現在已經秘密出奔到英倫，倖免於難。匈牙利的反對黨，幾乎全部私逃亡命，捷克斯洛伐克，現在正鬧得風雲密佈。在歐已經在加緊「淸一色運動」，西歐的「橋樑」，逐漸在失去作用。共產國際的華沙宣言中，已經明白痛斥萊翁勃倫和賴瑪迪，坐守在巴黎的杜萊茲（法共領袖）當然不會再跟法國的社會黨求妥協！</p>
<p>因此，在共產黨控制下的法國總工會，他們所領導下的「罷工」，也會層出不窮的跟著而來，前次二千淸道夫的罷工，向市政府衝鋒，幾乎釀成了大血案，通貨膨脹，物價在繼續增高，物資缺乏，循環地在滋長著道個恐怖的冬天！</p>
<p>因爲沒有煤，電力不够，巴黎再在正在　厲風行着「電的節約」，市的早晨沒有電，四郊晚上沒有電。倫敦郵報的新開標題說「巴黎人在黑暗中吃飯」。事實上，城裏人眞正起身早的，畢竟不多。</p>
<p>可怕的，仍然是糧食問題，積榖做的麵包，也逐漸在吃光用盡。共產黨所一再宣稱的俄國小麥，原先預定贈送一百五十萬噸到法國來，現在减少到僅僅三十萬噸，而且要用法國的汽車，紡織品和化學肥料作交換。法國有一個經濟談判的代表國在莫斯科，最妙的是：克里姆林宮的當局者明白告訴法國代表：蘇聯本沒有過多的糧食來供給外國，何况，法國並不是暈値得供給的國家！</p>
<p>是莫斯科預備捨棄這座橋樑呢，還是法蘭西本身在變？（於巴黎屈烈安諾飯店）</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕本市首次立法委員選舉，於昨最八時開始。曉霧猶濃，馬路盡濕，市民開工廠嗚汽笛後，即陸續赴各投票處投票。昨日爲投粟第一日，且非假期，公敎人員及寫字問職員僅能於午間及下班後抽暇投票，故尚未見踴躍。據估計：昨日區域選舉之票數，殆不足二十萬票。</p>
<p>吳市長國楨於最九時十分赴常熟區第三投票所（肇光中學），親投府委顏憲慶一票。據謂市長夫人將於廿三日中午在同一地點投票。潘議長公展因公赴京，開將於廿三日趕回，據推測什九亦將選　惠慶一票。國民黨市黨部書記長謝仁釗繼市長之後，在肇光中學內票選顏惠慶。界局長開先亦於昨晨在愚園路大西路區域內投票所投顏憲慶一票，對此次選舉秩序之佳，頗表欣慰。選務所總幹事張局長曉崧，則坐鎭選務所，整日與各方電話聯絡，處理各項突發事件，並指示一切。張氏表示仍將依國大選舉前例，於廿三日正午投最後一票，一家五口，將分別推舉各候選人，以示公平。</p>

<p>此次本市立委候選人，泰半皆知名之士，谷有基本票數，故競爭甚爲激烈，成敗之數，非至最後五分鐘不能確定。各候選人得票之名次，亦各區不同。黃浦區方面，王新衡方志超馬君碩頗佔優勢，特別軍警人員，幾一致票選王方兩氏。長寗區迄昨晚結束時，投票在一萬三千票以上，得票數以馬樹禮居首位，顏惠慶王新衡方志超次之，以卜爲曹俊謝仁釗等。嵩山區因人口集中，昨日選民投票者亦多，朱文德頗佔優勢。</p>
<p>吳市長向常熟區第三投票所領取選舉票（本報攝）</p>
<p>屋頂播音引人注意</p>
<p>朱文德假　嗚鞋帽店屋頂，設一臨時電台，以擴聲器伸出西藏路上，由一李姓小姐每隔數分鐘用國語播講一次，鶯聲嚦嚦之後，又夾以流行歌曲，頗引路人注目，該店與中法學校投票所僅隔數步，朱之競選宣傳可稱別緻而有效。</p>
<p>盧　區方面，估計昨日約有五千人投票，以王新衡方志超兩人得票較多。虹口方面，選民依身份不同而各選其欲選之人，軍警　方志超王新衡，蘇北人選馬樹禮。又昨靜安，楊涇，新涇，蓬萊等區馬君碩之票數亦頗佔優勢。綜觀昨日一般之投票秩序，顯因經驗增加之故，較之國代選舉時有進步、閘北第四所之糾紛，乃爲一不幸之例外。</p>
<p>數處糾紛</p>
<p>該投票所於昨日十一時左右，有兩百左右之選民蜂擁而來，要求憑選舉權證發給選票。當時督導趙星橋以來人並無身份證，不合手續，當加拒絕。隨即發生衝突，竟被圍毆，經選務所指示，停止投票約一小時，經警局派員到塲彈壓後，秩序始恢復，並繼續投票。督導趙星橋與該區第一投票所之督導對調。毆人之羣衆以「趙」「曹」同音，誤以趙督導爲候選人曹俊之弟，拒絕發給選票乃左袒曹俊，致引起此塲衝突，除此之外，楊樹浦提籃橋北站三區內，略有小糾紛，惟性質不嚴重，片刻即告解決。</p>
<p>競選活動各盡其能</p>
<p>昨日各候選人之競選活動，均臻白熟化，各馬路之「戰略要點」，隨處可見競選標語及宣傳列車。區域候選人中以鄭毓秀最不惜工本，除布條標語及宣傳車外，並用汽車在北四川路一帶沿街散發宣傳小册，並以小卡片散布馬路之上，以吸引行人。方志超之競選標語，亦頗具硏究，每一投票所門前，貼着許多　　，上書「選方志超者向此　」，頗多選民認為在此只能選舉万氏者。餘如　灣區第一投票所內，馬樹禮，馬君頭之活動亦最力，渠等以卡車接送選民，予人方便，自己方便。</p>
<p>今日爲投票第二日，預計情况之熱烈，將超過昨日。本市警察局長兪叔平，將在今晨赴盧灣區第一投票所投票。</p>
<p>為抗議九龍城事件，留下污點不易去除</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕本市學生界此次爲九龍城事件，曾於本月十七日集合外灘英領事館等處提出抗議，並遊行示威。當時有一部份學生曾將該館金色岡　以及英商若千洋行，甚至中央銀行等牆上滿塗柏油，並以柏油塗寫字句·茲悉該項擦除柏油字跡工程頗爲浩大，所費亦鉅，且不易刷新·據上海化學實驗所主任道爾頓稱，普通擦除柏油汚漬以汽油及火油最宜，但石塊及水門汀本身即能吸收柏油，雖可以上述油類擦除表面汚漬，但仍有遺痕。此外或可用燒碱或以高熱度吹火機先吹熱後再以汽油或火油擦除，然亦無法全部刷淸，道氏表示渠將立即試驗以發明一適常之去汚劑，以去除石塊及水泥上之柏油汚漬。</p>
<p>職業團體選舉分廿八處舉行　報人投票今日開始技師手續尙未齊備　丁界陸京十列車遊行聲勢浩大</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕職業團體立委選舉，昨竟日分在本市二十入處熱烈舉行。此次選舉與國大選舉不同之點，爲候選人名單印列選票上，選舉人祗須在被選舉人名上加一圓圈，一舉手之勞，省却不少代書筆誤等麻煩。再投票前尚須核對國民身份證，故秩序井然。選民因此次手續簡便，且對選舉方法已有經驗，故進行極爲順利。</p>
<p>競選人之宣傳活動，如火如荼，巨幅標語，紅綠傳單，滿佈街頭。其中尤以陸京士　　最爲浩大，晨九時起，各工會即爲共集結宜傳列車二十三輛，環經全市，彩帶繽紛，花團錦簇，各工廠並乘機在車上附加廣告，電風扇，熱水瓶，紛然雜陳。楊樹浦一帶各工廠工人在投票後，並列隊遊行，高唱擁護陸京士競選歌曲。綜計工會各投票所昨全日選舉結果，陸京士居首，凌英貞（女）較次。今日一部份工廠將爲選舉放假一日，預料選民必更增多。</p>
<p>教授人圈選不願人竊窺</p>
<p>大學敎員團體選舉，此次僅有敎授，講師，助敎參加，故人數甚少，昨投票情形未見踴躍。渠等在選票上書圈時，均不願爲人竊窺，靜處屋內一隅，鄭重思索，然後匆匆投入票匭，故無人能佔計該團體何者得票較多。此次復旦敎授朱斯煌，昨上午往震旦大學投票，經管理員核對復旦應在復興中學投票所投票，當發生細微爭執，朱堅持行使公民選舉權不限塲所，但管理員認爲票號不符即成廢票，雙方彬彬有禮，侃侃而辯，結果朱遵照指示，改赴復興中學投票。</p>
<p>歐元懷招待橘子花生米</p>
<p>大夏大學校長歐元懷，特在震旦大學投票所旁之小屋內，設有招待所一間，備有橘子花生米，招待投票之選民。歐氏昨日已獲有一百以上敎授之投票擁戴。</p>
<p>宣傳布幅以大世界廣塲最多，紅白相間，縱橫十數條，隨風飄舞。</p>

<p>增司機麻煩撕標語謾駡</p>
<p>特種工會中電訊工會因員工分散，爲便利投票起見，昨先在福州路收報處及團際電台辦理，今日再移橫浜櫈總局及眞如電台舉行。又候選人中頗多以宣傳　　散貼各種車輛上，惟自　汽車之車主對此極爲厭惡，常命司機將其仝部洗淨，因之術　間屢見司機一面撕洗，一面駡聲不絕。東吳大學將校車改裝爲流動廣播軍，赴街顯爲該校法學院院長　振爲作競選演講。</p>
<p>侯選人　亦有在街頭大量散發競選傳單者，惟此種傳單經路人略一察閱，瞬即　攤販收　，作包花生米五香豆之用。</p>

<h3 id="c64">血和淚交織畫面　幾處庇寒所巡禮　他們的遭遇不是匪就是災流亡的生涯包涵無限辛酸 <a href="#c64" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e64" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">64</a></h3>
<p>〔本報特寫〕記者昨天到四郊幾個庇寒所去訪問，與收容中的難民們談談，腦際裘彷彿印上一幅血與淚交織的畫面，非常深刻。這一幅畫面與都市的奢靡淫佚的另一面是如此地不調和，的確有如地獄天堂兩個極端那樣的苦樂懸殊。</p>
<p>在漕河涇冠生園農塲隔壁的第一庇寒所裏，一位二十多歲的蘇北靑年噙着淚訴說他的不幸底遭遇。他是江蘇阜寗人，家裏本來開紙烟舖，還有着五十四畝薄田，稱得上是一個小康之家。後來共產黨來了，不用說得，他們這一家是被〔鬥爭」的對象，店舖子被搶了封了，限產被沒收瓜分了，他的哥哥被用莫須有的罪名殺了。他一個人冒着險逃到上海來找他的表兄，因爲衣服襤褸，在街上就被警察抓了送到收容所來。他激動地說：「受過共產然刺激的人，才知道共產黨眞是可惡可恨！」</p>
<p>又有一位五十四歲的老顯子，頭髪已經白了。說話的時候聲淚俱下，嘴裏不住的喊「苦啊苦啊！」他是江蘇沛縣人，務晨爲業，自己有六十畝出，但是遭受水災侵害，已三年沒有收成了。這一次他到上海來投奔他的妹夫，也是在街上被警察以爲是乞丐而送了進來。</p>
<p>難民在庇寒所中露天進食（本報攝）</p>
<p>越是窮人越吃不飽</p>
<p>生生牧塲附近　第二收容所裏，楊樹浦軍工路的第三收容所裏，也有着不不少少的婦孺老幼。他們的遭遇幾乎都是大同小異，不是匪，就是災，把家傾了，把產蕩了，流亡的生涯裏包涵着無限的辛酸。</p>
<p>在庇寒所裏，他們雖然有了一套棉衣，一條棉被，以及一天兩餐苦飯，使他們獲得溫飽，但是他們父子不相見，兄弟妻子離散，這種精神上的痛苦，也够他們消受了。救濟常局規定每一個難民的食糧是每月米兩斗，每月菜費五萬元。兩斗米一月在普通人也許是够了，但越是這些苦命的人，越是胃腸的容量膨大，成人不用說了，許多小難民也都拿着空空的飯碗說：「我們吃不飽呀！」</p>
<h3 id="c65">難民逃走幾個原因 <a href="#c65" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e65" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">65</a></h3>
<p>第一庇寒所收容的是</p>
<p>第一庇寒所收容的是壯年難民，因為辦得早，比較已經上軌道，管理方法，完全採用軍事化，每天除食宿外，還令他們排隊體操，並由管理員授以生活敎育。第二庇寒所收容的是婦孺老幼，管理起來就比較困難。第三庇寒所則還是最近才開辦，因爲經費有限，人手缺乏，秩序還有些未納正軌，而且地址與後方失業工人招待所合在一起，管理上尤爲困難，有些不願躭擱在庇寒所裏的難民便業機逃出。</p>
<p>說到難民的從庇寒所裏逃走，粗粗想來似乎爲不可思議之事。但昨天記者就親眼看到親耳聽到幾個難民請求讓他們出去。根據這些人的稅話，大概可以分爲幾類，一種是並非難民而被誤捉進來的，一種雖是難民，但因家屬仍流浪在外，所以寗願出去共甘苦的。一種是捉進來的乞丐　三之類，他們的乞討生活着實比收容所裏來得舒服，當色希望出去了。</p>

<p>軍工路的第三收容所裏就有一個小　三樣子的孩子把拇指一翹，神氣活現地說：「我在外面天天有魚啊肉啊吃的，捉到這裏來眞是倒霉！」</p>
<p>最折社會局已在開始辦理工賑庇寒所十幾處集中壯年的難民實行以工代賑。這種辦法頗値得鼔勵，因爲據記者的觀察，單單給難民與游民們食與住是絕對不够的，這最多使他們維持原始動物的生命罷了，更重要的是給他們以工作，使他們生活得像一個「人」。</p>

<h3 id="c82">踏勘古田銀礦　閩省大富源亟待開發 <a href="#c82" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e82" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">82</a></h3>
<p>﹝本報福州十九日航訊﹞被世人所遺忘的福建古田縣二十八都竹林鄉銀塲鑛的銀礦，現在　又引起國人的注意，尤是南洋的僑胞。此鑛藏之開採工作，始於明季宣德年間，當時庫藏的白銀，皆依賴此鎮鑛山之出產，但由於當時朝庭的腐化，負責監督開採者之貪污與壓迫，致激起鑛工流血的反抗，因此而中止工作。隨年代和時日的變化，此閩省大富源之銀塲鑛遂被國人所遺忘了。</p>
<p>記者日前曾應南僑經建公司之邀，與建應技正陳啓發，同往該地踏勘。此一　沒了數百年的鑛山真面，如今得以　見一面，是私心認為欣幸的事。</p>
<p>我們翻開明史的記載，不難證實銀塲鎮一帶鑛山藏銀之量甲於各省，民國二十六年行政院資源委員會曾派工程師三十餘人來此踏勘，據彼等之報告，銀塲鎮周圍廿公里內的鑛山，均產銀，惜因翌年「七七」事起，開採工作未能實現。年前美國務院亦派工程師三人來此實地調查，彼等之報告書中亦謂鑛藏可開採至深達三百公尺，銀質約含百分之九十七純銀。該鑛產量最低估計，約在四十萬噸以上。其開採工作，至少需四百餘年始能　盡。</p>
<p>今日此鎮人口稀少，鑛山週圍，雜草叢生。與鄉人談往事，不勝唏噓感嘆。此因明季宣德皇帝時代，為了開採此鑛，曾徵調民工數萬名，但當時管理不善，欽差大臣及督工處事貪污，人民怨聲載道，尤不幸者，一處鑛坑突告崩裂，而所　之民工盡被活埋於其中。人民為　憤計，乃誘導欽差大臣至鑛坑巡視時，將大臣加以活埋，以示報復。宣德皇帝為此事大發雷霆，下了一道命令：銀塲鄉附近十里內人民，一律抄斬。此開採工程遂告停頓。現在，此地居民皆為近年從他地　來者，今日與彼等談起開擦之事，均有談「銀」色變之概。</p>
<p>這閩省大富源之一的銀鑛，記者盼望早日開發，對目前國家經濟之危機，不但可解救於萬一，且對國家經濟富裕，想亦有所　助。吾人深望政府領導僑胞投資，積極迅速地來開發這一個富源！</p>

<p>記者今晨往訪郭氏，以此行任務及玉門礦塲近况相詢，據稱：此次來闌，純為與甘肅省政府洽購員工食糧，因礦塲員工近萬，月需食糧達四千餘石，必須預為購儲。</p>
<p>上年十一月初，寒流即襲抵玉門，礦塲經常氣溫在攝氏零下二十八度，以迄於今。礦塲雪深四尺有餘，致部份機器凍結，凍裂，生產已陷於半停頓狀態。十一月底起，礦方曾動員員工三千餘人，在冰天雪地中搶修，在此困難時期，仍勉強設法支持生產。三十五年前，煉塲所用者為蒸溜爐，上年增設半裂化煉油爐，在　量方面，裂化爐較蒸溜爐增產百分之八十至百分之百，在質的方面，蒸溜法煉得百分之十九者，裂化法可提高至百分之三十五至三十八。自裂化路爐油管被凍裂後，現僅蒸溜爐勉強支持工作，故產量銳減，但較之過去任何一個冬天，產量則仍屬最大，因過去十月份以後，各機器常陷於冬眠狀態也。礦塲油田面積，已較兩年前增加四倍，達五十平方公里，現有油井三時餘口，惟經常出油者，僅十餘口，產品以汽油為主，煤，柴油次之，石蠟則為副產品。該礦新購　井，煉油器材，共六千餘噸現均集中上海，除交空運一部急用者外，大部均須運漢口經川湘公路西運，最近更計劃　運天津，由平綏路經寗夏運來。今年增產計劃之能否實現，胥視此項器材之能否及時暈倒。物資供應局擬售該公司之四噸半大道奇卡車，現已陸續運抵漢口，正接洽西駛中。</p>

<p>﹝本報福州十五日航訊﹞閩省境內多山，耕地奇缺，過去食糧均不敷自給，當局自去年起會資請「行總」協助，辦理沿海各縣海灘　墾工作，養淡成田，藉裕民食。工程　展以來，各方寄望甚殷，無如自本年起，「行總」結果，　費　告拮据，若干工務，中途擱淺，殊堪　惜。省府為此　經全國水利會議，請予全面開拓，奈以　費　需浩大，庫藏無法　支　中止。頃聞水利部已對此予以重視，並且電閩查詢可資　　面積及價值，擬令省方儘力督導當地人民團體自力經營。記者頃特訪問前此出發各地查勘實况之水利局人員，茲將閩省現　段　墾工程計　及其現况誌之於下：</p>
<p>閩省海　綫尙屬綿長，自北沙　港，三河灣，閩江口，以迄閩南各沿海縣屬，皆為</p>
<p>一片海水　浸蝕，潮漲時，固一片汪洋，漲落之際，則沿海濱一二里內悉係「海　」，（即為含鹽份極豐富之泥淖，）此類塲地，除平日產畜少數貝類外，鮮有所獲，若能加以　墾，拒海水出入，則二三年後，悉可易為良田。且該項田地含鹽質甚豐，穀物極易　殖。一經墾就，獲利必多。去年春間，省水利局曾組隊分赴閩東南沿岸勘察，當時發現可資　墾海　，計有閩東之林森·連江·羅源·寗德·福安·霞浦·福鼎等七縣，合二十處，面積為三八九五二〇市畝。另有閩南之福清·平潭·　田·仙遊·同安·惠安·晋江·金門·廈門等九縣市，二十一處，面積亦達一九八七九〇市畝，總計全省凡十六縣市，四十一處，總面積達五十八萬八千三百〇十市畝，預計全部養淡完成後，年可增產二百七十一萬八千一百九十市担食糧。嗣以</p>
<p>工程浩大</p>
<p>無從全面着手，乃又擇定其經濟價值較大之二十六處，凡二一八三四〇市畝地塲，先行具辦。此二十六處，　林森縣嘉登鄉（五〇〇市畝），　連江　　鄉，（一一五〇〇市畝，）　羅源松獲鄉，（一五八八〇市畝，）　寗德西　塘，（一〇〇〇〇市畝，）　福安灣塢鄉，（七五〇市畝，）　霞浦沙哈塘，（六〇〇〇市畝，）　福清東閣區，（八七〇〇市畝，）　　潭竹　口，（三四〇〇〇市畝，）　　田北高岱石，（五一〇市畝，）　　平潭火燒港，（一〇〇〇〇市畝，）　　仙遊陡門村，（六〇〇〇市畝，）　　同安內州港，（八六〇〇市畝，）　　同安唐　港，四七〇市畝，　　同安馬港，（四六三〇市畝，）　　惠安白崎港，（一三五〇〇市畝，）　　惠安後爭村（二〇八〇市畝，）　　惠安青山東　，（二〇〇市畝，）　　晋江五里橋，（一一五〇市畝，）　　　　竹　保，（一一七〇〇市畝，）　　　　漢江鄉，（四五〇〇市畝，）　　　安四　后，（四一五市畝，）　　　安牙頭，（四六五市畝，）　　　　海門，（七一〇〇市畝，）　　潭浦太浦，（三五〇〇市畝）。內中寗德西　塘等十餘所，皆已興工經年。</p>
<p>工　期間</p>
<p>經費多賴行　支持，工資悉用麵粉替代，略帶半工半　意味，惜為時不再，一度半途而止。多年來，閩省糧食不繼，饑荒成災，另一方面，沿海地帶人口過剩，無法出國求生，　致勞力空耗，流民日增。今欲期兩全之計，莫　將斯類工程加緊舉辦，一則　導　萬游民於農耕正通，二則可以奠定今後本省食糧，但此　開　經費問題，頗費周章。</p>
<p>根據　前省方計劃，此項工程，除　量設計等已由省方負責外，此後</p>
<p>墾工作</p>
<p>須由各縣市政府或當地人民　　經營，以月前縣財政情況衡之，前　實不允樂觀。但以工程完成後之利　而言，相信將　不乏有人　力，科學畢竟是　戰勝　工的，假如這許多　墾工程能夠完成，那麼今後　建糧食是不　匱乏的。（特約記者黃岑）</p>

<p>關於限制內匯，以免游資集中於滬，刺激物價事，其限制辦法，仍由財政部在商擬中。據悉：國家行局現已開始個別執行限制內匯，對各地匯來上海之匯款，均個別嚴加審核，對上海匯出之款項則無限制云。</p>
<p>又工商界對國家行局個別執行限制內匯事，頗感困難，因一部份正當之行商，其有時依靠內地匯來之匯款，作週轉資金之用，在無辦法之限制聲中，彼等之正當匯　勢必無法爲適應需要而暢匯，故工商界希望國家行局在限制內匯時，能與正常行商之匯款一種通融辦法，使正當行商之資金不致週轉不靈。</p>

<h3 id="c146">國際貿易實務 <a href="#c146" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e146" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">146</a></h3>
<p>— 邢廣益</p>
<p>安之介著　商務印書館出版</p>
<p>我國在戰前的貿易，　受不平等條約的束縛，一切處於不利地位，大部份是操諸外商之手，進出口貿易多由洋行包辦。以迄抗戰期間，政府爲適應戰時的需要，採取統制的貿易政策，但因倫陷區域的進出口貨物旣無法控制，加以國際路錢的限斷，很難發展自在意中。洎乎勝利以後，我國進出口貿易大有擴展趨勢，國內進出口商行如雨後春筍蓬勃而生。國際貿易是一種複雜的業務，在買賣交易上實有種種技術問題，需加深切的研究。關於國際貿易理論的書，坊間所出的已有不少，但專以國際貿易實務爲硏究對象的書，尚不多觀，其能切於實用者尤少。本書著者憑其業務上實際經騐，對國際貿易實務作有系統的叙述，本書雖以貿易技術爲主，但在國際貿易實務理論化一點上，頗多貢獻，非但可作大學商學院有關國際貿易的　當敎本，也是從事國際貿易者的良好讀物。</p>
<p>全書共五編十九章，上下兩册，計四九七頁。著者在總論首先說明國際貿易的種種困難和複雜情形，所謂複雜困難情形，也就是技術問題，必須對國際貿易備有熟嫻的技術，然後可以克服困難，並保障貿易上可能發生的危險。著者特別强調國際貿易生存的信條爲「互惠第一」，戒取巧，重諾言。</p>
<p>第一編買賣論，分別就賣買的條件，方式，價格，準備四章加以闡述。對於價格的幣制著者認爲戰後我國已躍爲四强之一，一切貿易應採自主政策，第一必須堅持進口貿易以我國國幣計價，這種見解是合理的，不過在目前情勢之下，一時恐未必就能實現。</p>
<p>於賣買的基本方式，即是　「發價」，所謂「發價」爲「交易當事人之一造，向對方提出某種賣買條件表示願依法簽訂法律上有效之買賣合約」。經營出口時更有採取「借發價」的手段，即自己手中無貨，接到國外買方「發價」後，旣不願先行購入貨物，又不願失却交易機會，乃向內地供給者洽商請借發價，亦限定接受期，借到後發電與國外買方，如成交即將貨物以原借發價向內地供給者購入。此種方式爲戰前倫居我國洋行慣常應用，我國內地出口商類多不諳國際貿易經營，一任洋行予取予求的剝削。</p>
<p>第二編單據論，本編論述以單據之種類，性質，作用，形式，製作，獲取及獲取手續爲主，對各種單據上常用之記號，文字隨時解釋說明其原理。單據的種類有售貨合約，購貨定單，信用狀，匯票，提單，棧單，各種保險單，各種發票，花色碼單等，除說明開製手續外並詳舉實例以供參考採用，頗切實際。</p>
<p>第三編貨運論，首先說明包裝方法與嘜頭形式及船位洽定手續，其次闡述裝船及報關等手續，並檢附各種應用單據如出口報單，洋貨進口報單，檢騐證明書，承購外匯證明書，裝船書等式樣。</p>
<p>第四編金融論，主要的論述外匯問題，說明出口外匯即由出口之商出售而由政府或銀行界以國幣加以收買，進口外匯即進口商購入而由政府或銀行收受國幣出售者。一切外匯的兌換，均為一注買賣，進出口商必須與政府或銀行簽訂買賣合約，方合手續，著者列舉買賣合約的方式，並就合約的內容說明其原理。其次叙述出口貿易資金週轉的方法，即藉押匯方式及打包放款的方式設法利用銀行資金週轉，這本是銀行本身的業務，但經營者必須熟悉個中各項手續，著者詳述各種手續辦理程序以及申請的各種式樣，以供參考。</p>
<p>第五編索賠論首先說叫如因量的短缺與損毀應斟酌情形査明責任向遝輸公司及保險公司要求賠償，如因質的低劣與變化則斟酌情形向賣方索賠。著者根據各種不同的情形，都有明確的解決辦法。</p>
<p>以上是本書的鳥瞰，爰就觀感所及，再述評如下：</p>
<p>綜觀全書次序分明，有融化貫通前後呼應之妙，而無重複矛盾之弊。淸晰簡當，使讀者循序漸進，易於瞭解。是其長處。</p>
<p>本書着重在貿易技術，對應用單據格式，所蒐顯材料廣泛而豐富，對技術上應用之術語及記號，無不詳細解釋，並舉實例，意有未盡者於每編後另加附註補充，不厭求詳。務使讀者澈底明瞭。因爲經營國際貿易必須通曉外國語文，尤應以英語爲基本。本書無論在實務的原理上及技術上儘量以英語註解，對讀者應用上是很多貢獻的，書末並附英文索引，按圖索驥，格外方便。</p>
<p>經營進出口貿易必須熟諳個中技巧，方不致喫虧。其間一得一失，在在影響一筆交易的盈虧著者在本書有許多地方很精細的提示到技巧方面，讀者不難研究而體會到，彌足珍視。</p>

<p>馬迪厄著　楊人楩譯　商務版</p>
<p>西洋的史學介紹到中國來已經有將近三十年的歷史，但是西洋史學名著之譯爲中文却寥寥可數，尤其是國別史和專門史。這裏所要介紹的就是一部經過作者畢生硏究，又經過譯者數年的迻譯和註釋始告完成的名著名譯。牠不但對於治史學的顯友們可資借鏡，就是對於我們這時代的社會生活也有其深長的影響，的確是一部値得特別介紹的書。</p>
<p>當我們提到西方的民主政治或西方的生活方式時，每每要把牠的制度和精神的背影追溯到十八世紀末年的法國革命。的確，人類的政治和社會生活都有着歷史的淵源，構成現代西方生活的一切心理，制度，乃至物質的因素的探討，往往必須回溯那漫長的過去，才能發現其來龍去脈。這種回顯對於我們的研究和瞭解，帮助非常之大，已經成爲一種必不可少的重要步驟了。歐洲的政治，社會及歷史學者對於法國革命都寄以特殊的注意，因爲法國革命對於西方的民主政治和西方的生活方式的，外現的和潛在的影響實在太大了。一百多年來法國革命的硏究有着輝煌的成績，而這些硏究都是伴隨着廣博而精密的史料的整理和分析。尤其是最近數十年，由於封存中的史料的開放，史料範圍的擴大，新材料的發現，整理和分析，及其在技術上方法上的長足進步，西方學者在法國革命的硏究上的進展是可以想見的，尤其是法國的學者。他們的精神和方法都値得我們注意。</p>
<p>馬迪厄（Albert　Mathiez）是晚近法國的優秀史家。他以畢生的精力和時間專攻法國革命史，的確是近代學者治學的好模範。他對於法國革命的研究可以說達到了截至目前為止的，西方學者對於法國革命的研究的極峯，舉世實無其正。他並沒有服膺什麽歷史哲學，而他在研究的精神和態度上的唯一焦點就是求眞。他很注意那時代的經濟生活，但他並非經濟史的專家，他的着重點還是在議會和政黨。歷史中的個人因素也很注意，與全然抹煞個人因素的唯物史觀逈然不同。他只是强調經濟因素的作用。在這一點上，他和他的先生，當時法國革命史的權威學者奧拉爾有着數十年的爭論。對於法國革命的看法是</p>
<p>他對於法國革命的看法是綜合的，雖然强調經濟因素，對於偶然事件的作用也不休煞。尤其可貴的是他的運用材料。他儘量利用原始材料，諸如當時的報紙雜誌和小册子，地方政府和巴黎政府的檔案，私人的日記，信扎，回憶錄等。這些原始材料在他的周密精詳的分析之下，都成爲有用的，寶貴的史料，而構成其論文及著作的血肉。他最初的硏究只限於革命時代的示敎問題，但後來硏究的範圍擴及革命的各方面，尤其是議會和政黨方面。而對於革命的各個階段都有澈底的硏究。他一生的著作幾乎全是專題硏究的論文，而這三卷「法國革命史」就是他將本人畢生研究的結果加以組織而寫成的，唯一的綜合性的著作，也就是他畢生研究的結晶，自有其一貫的態度和方法，與一般綜合他人硏究結果而寫成的自然有顯著的不同。</p>
<p>這部書的文筆雖然洗練謹　却不失其生動。因爲作渚認爲學識考證與歷史著作不同。歷史著作的任務在於將「歷史本身」加以「重建」和「表現」。學識考證是分析的，而歷史著作是綜合的。道部「法國革命史」就是作者的綜合性著作。作者企岡「插繪一幅具有各種外形的法國革命的岡畫，儘可能去辦到正確，明晰與生動。」（見作者原序）。各種錯綜複雜的社會因素，在這部書裏都安排得有條不紊，表現了組織上的高度成就。又原序：「本書是根據大量文獻而寫的，其中有些是未經印行的文獻，而且是用一種獨立的批評精神來解釋的。」由此可以見到作者的精神，學養，和手法。並且由於文筆的生動，雖然是專門著作，　來却沒有晦澀的感覺。至於這部書所包括的年代是從三級會　到新十一月事變。這種起　在當時　引起許多批評，後來却爲多數學者所同意，認爲是合理的。新十一月事變以後以迄執政府的時期，作者另有專著與本書銜接。</p>
<p>除了原作，本書的　譯也値得我們特別介紹。譯者是國內有數的西洋近代史的學者，並且是法國革命史的專家。譯者早年在牛津從湯普生（J.M.Thompson）專攻法國革命史，並由湯普生指導寫成論文「聖鞠斯特」（已在商務出版其中文）。而湯普生即爲馬迪厄一派的著名學者。所以譯者之硏究法國革命史自有其馬迪厄一派之師承的淵源。對於馬迪厄治學的精神和方法，譯者自有其獨到的領悟和體會。譯者在八年抗戰期中在後方的主要工作，除了在大學主講法國革命史外，就是本書的繙譯。迻譯時爲了週詳精密並參照了英譯本，且改正了英譯本中的若干錯誤和脫漏，所以這個譯本比英譯本更爲忠實而元善。至於譯名，也參考了各種專書，並定了五個原則，（見譯序）可見譯者態度之謹愼和方法的精密了。至於譯筆都是文從字顯的直譯，信達　顯。且文筆能與原作密切楔合，雖爲直譯，却並不覺得佶屈　牙。</p>
<p>此外關於中譯本還有兩點是值得特別介紹的，就是註釋和附錄。原作爲一般讀者而寫，省去註釋。但中國讀者，尤其是並非專攻法國史的中國讀者一定要感到困難。譯者乃參照多種專書，詳爲註釋·並爲便於讀者參考，譯者又加了五個附錄。其中「法國革命大事表」，「指劵貶値表」，「共和國二年革命暦對照表」可供檢査與對照，「法國革命史的硏究概况」和「馬迪厄與法國革命史之研究」是譯者寫的，可供讀者對於法國革命史的硏究之經過及成果以及原作者的態度和方法諸端的瞭解上的帮助。這五個附錄的價値是可以想見的。</p>
<p>憲政肇始之年，對於西方民主政治的瞭解是迫切需要的，而這部書正滿足了這個需要。我們願誠意的介紹這部著作和這個譯本。</p>

<h3 id="c149">哈代和他的「歸來」 <a href="#c149" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e149" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">149</a></h3>
<p>— 石碚</p>
<p>（英·哈代著　海觀譯　正風出版社印行）</p>
<p>（一）</p>
<p>近年來美國的出版刋行有硏究哈代（Thomas　Hardy）的專書：是席　爾（Lord　Robert　Cecil）的「小說家的哈代」（Hardy　the　velist）：另一木是魏伯（Carl　J.Weber）的「哈代在美國」Hardyin　America）。這兩本書都是偏重研究哈代的小說。這證明了哈代的作品到現在仍爲讀者所敬重，具有永久存在的價値。</p>
<p>哈代於一八四〇年六月二日，生於英國道塞郡的道徹斯特城，他的家庭經營建築職業。十六歲時，也倆做了道徹斯特城裏的一個建築師　學徒；二十二歲的時候，他在倫敦進了亞瑟。布洛菲也得爵士的建築公司工作。他在那裏白天去做建築的工作，利用晚上的時間在倫敦大學讀書；並且一面努力寫作，一連出版了好多部小說，詩集和散文，其中有六七部小說被列爲英國小說中的偉大的作品。一九二八年一月十一日他在故鄉病逝，享年八十二歲。</p>
<p>我們讀過哈代的小說，隱約之間，可以窺見他的人生觀。在他的世界裏，人類的地位最不重要，硏究人類的智力與工作不足使我們瞭解宇宙的奧義，與事物的主要合理性與不合理性。人不僅爲其同類所箝制，壓抑，與侮辱；他不僅與同類鬥爭；他那舛錯的命運不僅爲其同類所造成，我們的世界充滿不測的變幻，人旣然生在這個世界裏就得受環境的支配。</p>
<p>由於哈代的人生觀是從這一個角度爲出發的，所以他的文藝的理想是希臘的悲劇。他尊敬而且承受着希臘悲劇大詩人亞屈列斯（Aschlus）和索弗克甲斯（Sophocles）的精神，他愛讀這兩位詩人的悲劇。他在一八八〇年還讀過叔　華和哈特曼（Hartmann），這些著作都深深地影響了哈代的思想。他的小說也便是帶着濃重的感傷氣氛，展開在我們的而前。</p>
<p>（二）</p>
<p>我們從前而去理解了哈代的人生觀和他的文藝創作的觀點，再來讀「歸來」（The　Return　of　The　Native），才可以看出在「歸來」裏，他已經把他的藝術和他對於自己的哲學的信念，發揮到了充分的高度，使他對於人生的見解得到充分的表現。因爲「歸來」的結構完整，均衡，和適當，使它成爲哈代悲劇小說由最偉大傑出的一部。</p>
<p>在這書的　頭上，哈代代寫着這樣的一首詩：</p>
<p>「我向悲痛告別了，</p>
<p>我要把她拋在遠遠的後面；</p>
<p>但她却歡欣地，歡欣地，</p>
<p>親密地戀着我；</p>
<p>她對我是這樣地忠實，這樣地親切呀。</p>
<p>我要欺瞞了她，</p>
<p>從此拋開了她，</p>
<p>但是，啊！她對我是這樣地忠實，</p>
<p>這樣地親切呀。」</p>
<p>這一首詩，纏綿悱惻地縈廻在我們的腦中，它是小說的基調，貫串着整個故事，由悲痛開始也從悲痛終結</p>
<p>全書分爲六部：第一部，三女性；第二部，歸來；第三部，迷惑；第四部，閉門；第五部，察覺；第六部，後事。作者描寫的背景，是一遍含蓄着迷惑如夢幻中的艾格登原野；那裏是荒凉的，神秘的，差不多是大自然的客觀的，不祥的力量的象徵，毫無所動地靜視着那襲繫着住在這一個區域以內的男女們的命運。第一童中描寫羨：「這塊地方此刻和人類的天性完全契合了——旣不可怖可憎，也不醜惡；旣不平凡，也不庸俗；但是却像人類一樣地被忽略而連續下去，在單調的蒼茫暮色中帶着僅有的龐大和神秘。和久久離　索居的人在一起，孤獨彷彿失去了它的顏色。這是一個寂寞的地方，暗示出發生悲劇的可能·」道就是「歸來」的背景，作者已經把它人格化了。</p>
<p>故事是以十一月五日的放烟火開塲，紅色的火光一道接着一道地上升，點綴了整個的鄉村，一束一束淡黃色的光輝扇形地在稠密的空氣周圍幅射出來，溫柔的黛馨和美麗的女主人翁烏絲黛莎的命運就集中在這環境裏。中間是過渡到歡迎克林·約勃萊特從巴黎歸來。而把結婚做爲最後的結局，最初是黛馨和威迪甫的結婚，之後是烏絲黛莎和克林，約勃萊特的結婚。但是這兩對夫婦，各人並不滿意於自己所獲得的愛，所以在第二年便一月五日遇到了無意的火的時號，十引起了烏絲黛莎和成迪甫在漆黑的風雨之夜逃走了，最後他們都不幸的溺死在荒原上的水　裏，在慘厲的暴風雨夜，在發亮的漩渦和白色的泡沫中間，那便是愛的歸宿。</p>
<p>然而在小說的「後事」裏，作者給我們通過了哀傷的悲劇氣氛，看見一綫誠懇樸素的新生的愛底結合，和永亙忠於職務的生活。前者是黛馨和卑微　紅土販——狄哥利，懷恩的結婚；後者是克林，約勃萊特在雨塚上以傳道工作面終結一生，儘管有些批評家說這一部份是多餘的，但我是珍愛羨它的，正如哈代對黛馨復活了的愛用計歌　　着：</p>
<p>「她從　　上面，把她的愛人呼喚，</p>
<p>哦，進來吧，</p>
<p>外面是那樣濃，那樣的濃的露水呀！」</p>
<p>在這一點上，使我們看見了愛的幻滅，也能看見了純潔的愛的新生。</p>
<p>（三）</p>
<p>哈代在「歸來」中，發揮了他那確實的限劇性，對於氛圍氣和佈局的適當，緊凑的結構，都使它的內容不同凡俗。若從景物的描寫上說，「歸來」也是最成功的作品。哈代認爲景物是小說的首要質素，是故事的發展所不可缺少的東西，他在「歸來」裏，就是運用了他具有詩意的牧歌方法表現羨景物的形象。這是我們應該値得特別提出來的。辛列非（J.W.Cunliffe）曾經說：「歸來」是一座壯麗的建築物；它的故事在人類命運的高度上輕快地移動羨，沒有慌忙也沒有浪費的力量，而且技巧上是非常的完美，其細微的地方，我們祗有在精密地考査過後才會明瞭的。令人感動的或是富於幽默趣味的塲面一個接着一個，我們以永遠提高的注意跟隨到指定的終點；我們看到的是每一個極細小的部份如何適當地構成了完整的全部。」</p>
<p>這是說明了「歸來」創作的技巧。我想這也該是給「歸來」最恰當的評價。如果厭倦於哈代悲劇小說的讀者，讀了「歸來」，一定不會再是「厭倦」而是有所收獲的。</p>

<h3 id="c150">授受 <a href="#c150" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e150" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">150</a></h3>
<p>— 何苦</p>
<p>我想大家歡喜過陰歷新年甚於陽歷新年的原因之一，是因爲在迫近陰曆年關的幾天，我們可以多少獲得一份在月薪與津貼之外的金錢，只要你是在一個甚至連糊口都勉强的商號，社團，或機關裏任事的話。道一份金錢，有的稱年賞，有的稱年終津貼，有的稱分紅，而爲額外部份的收獲則一。</p>
<p>在這個都市裏，不知道有好幾個家庭，藉這份額外的金錢，我們姑混稱之爲「年費」吧，而獲得了平常日子所不能獲得的溫暖，例如孩子們也許可以吃到一點平時想望但又難以輕易獲得的糖果，妻子也許可以穿一件平時在樹窗裏看到，但又買不起的衣服，而自己則也許可以效膽邀請幾個平時投契的親友到家中來吃一頓比平時略爲嫂盛的午餐………等等，假如沒有了這一份年費，則諸如上述的溫情即使要求如曇花之一現，也是難於達到的。</p>
<p>照例，這種年費，從各個單獨獻名稱看來，像「年終津貼」，像「年賞」，像「分紅」，大都是出諸於一方自動，應該很自然地到某一時期發放下來，像春天應該有梅花，秋天應該開菊花一般。但事實則不然，今日的「年費」非要用力量去爭取，去要求才可以到手，亦足見「時難艱荒世業空」的一般情形之嚴重了。</p>
<p>其實年費的發放，還是對於「市面」有利的。因爲一般久缺溫暖的「取」者，拿到這筆錢，還不是「與」之社會，不論其年之凋，景之急，總是換了一點東西回家，家庭固然獲得溫暖，同時市面也獲得了溫暖，從這一點想，給與的一方正該心平氣和地慷慨解囊了。</p>
<p>到今日，這一份年費，已談不到積蓄，只是一種希望與賜與，一種溫暖的授受。假如冬天裏有春天的話，那便是要一方在賜與及授受之後，在沉重的險上露着一份稍縱即逝的微美而已。</p>
<h3 id="c151">談日記 <a href="#c151" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e151" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">151</a></h3>
<p>— 呂乃眞</p>
<p>有些人記日記，有些人不記日記，大概還是不記的人較多。我也是不記日記的，我認爲普通記日記祗如記流水帳或是作乾燥無味的起居注，記久了好像這是一種刑罰，每天必做但又不願去做。正如一個從來沒有吃過一點什麽營養品的窮漢，一下子有了錢趕快去買了一聽五磅裝的克寗奶粉回來，開頭幾天吃得很高興，吃過個把日後，好了，再也不耐煩去吃了，什麽營養佳味統統成了一種刑罰。不吃，奶粉會壞，吃嗎，又吃厭了，於是只好硬吞，再不然就去請別人來吃。記日記也是這樣，開顯記得很有勁，個把月後不耐煩了，有一天缺一天地記下去，再等個把月，索性乾脆不記了。無怪乎「金銀島」的作者斯蒂文遜會說記日記是一種「從事練習的職業」，非要有那種按時上辦公的精神才能記得有始有終。</p>
<p>如果說日記是人生的痕跡，這話也不盡然，個人的生死兩件大事就不能記，至於一些芝蔴大的事情，像什麼「母親今天來了一封信……」，「他媽的，中午又吃蘿　，膳廳裏一片喊聲……」這些東西旣不能作爲你將來成為名人以後寫自傳的材料，也不是什麼賓貴的「人生的痕跡」。至於自己一生的大事像初戀，結婚，大學畢業等等，根本就是不記起來，它的前後經過也會牢牢地刻在心坎裏的。</p>
<p>私人的日記難免不會給別人偷看的，有許多事情就往往不能放胆記下去，日記有時固然亦可以表明自己的心跡，但因此而得罪朋友，甚至身陷囹圄的也不在少數。</p>
<p>我不記日記，我情願把自己値得記的一些事情寫成獨立成篇的小說或散文，這樣就可不怕人家偸看，而且還可以練習寫作。小說裏面的情節就好此是一根記憶的繩索，它會牽引我想到一大片的往事。</p>
<p>記日記本來是初學習作的最好的方法，可惜一般人都把它記成了乾燥無味的流水帳，以致與文學無干。能够像胡適先生的「藏暉室剳記」一樣把一天的大事感想寫成寥寥數行的剳記，固然省事，再不然就如朱光潛先生所說的：「你不必預定每天應記的字數，只要把應記的記得恰到好處，長則數百字，短則數十字，都可不拘。你也不必在一天之內同時記許多事，多記了難免如「數萊菔下窖」決不會記得好。選擇是文學的最重要的工夫，你每天選一件錢値得記的，把它記得妥妥貼貼，記成一件「作品」出來，那就够了。」否則乾脆不記，省得徒受「刑罰。」</p>

<p>— 芒</p>
<p>印度有一百萬以上的人每日都在焚香　祝，希望死後能在嘉顯著的屍塲焚化。</p>
<p>印度死了人之後，立刻就將屍首移出屋外。男人用白布裏身，女人則用紅布。但因惡疾如麻瘋。天花而死的人，以及小孩，根本不包裹，只簡單的往恒河裏一投。</p>
<p>抬死人到焚化塲的儀式很簡單。沒有所謂柩車，死屍只綁在一根竹竿上，由雨個親人抬在肩上，一路唱一路走到河邊去。</p>
<p>到了河邊之後，他們給死人在聖河裏洗最後的一次澡，然後就造火焚屍。造好一個約有四尺高的木材堆之後，他們就將屍首放在木堆上，又在死屍的胸上堆了許多乾牛糞。然後，剃光了頭穿白衣的寡婦便從一塊聖地帶了火來，在她丈夫的嘴上放了一把肉，圍着太材的架堆繞了五週，然後一無表情地便在她丈夫的胸口前的一堆上引起火來。</p>
<p>火燃燒得很快。但寡婦還不時用長竹竿撥弄，呌火燒的更快。</p>
<p>到火熄了之後，寡婦相將未燒盡的部分統統投在河裏。同時，她的親戚們也將　帶到水邊，將她的手腕與腿上的金銀裝飾都取下來投入河裏。然後，從河裏取了一土罐的水，她扛在肩上走到屍灰前，對準一澆。接着她就一直的回去了，連頭也不回一下。</p>

<p>— 鄭過宜</p>
<p>某報副刋有「紀宋處士謝翱」，考證詳贍，欽挹無已。惟以處士名謝臯羽（翱）竊恐於義朱安；蓋皋羽初從文文山（天祥）幕中，崎嶇兵問，忘萬死不顧一生，旣非避世之流，而宋亡以後，雖匿迹逃亡，然故國黍離之痛，寄悲憤於西臺慟哭，其文其事，足使宇宙變色，鬼神感泣，至今千載，猶凜凜然如見其人，更不得以晉處士陶靖節（淵明）之例例之也。</p>
<p>靖節於晉末暫仕即隱，易代而後，終不再出，如此者謂之處士可耳。皋羽所遭，豈斯之比，蒙謂不若名之為養士，庶幾從皋羽本志，而不失其面目之眞，輒吐狂妄，不知有當高明否？臯羽墓在粵中，及其子孫散居潮陽，事皆載於縣志，是否有所假托，殆不可知。余潮陽人也，偶從鄉老談及謝臯羽，多瞠目莫悉其本末，且茫然謝臯羽爲何如人者。潮陽文風素敝，史蹟類非所知，言之不勝愾歎！古墓之出附會，潮州又不僅謝臯羽爲然，即陸丞相（秀夫）亦有疑冡在焉。陸秀夫負宋帝（　）蹈海，已葬身波濤，骸骨何從而得？其爲好事者假設，斷斷無疑。（秀夫鹽城人，據云鹽城又有陸丞相墓，則尤難曉已。）顯秀夫遺蹟之載潮州府志者甚多，墓冡之外，距饒平城東百二十里之南澳，孤峙海島，有洲曰侍郎，亦以陸丞相而名。一說宋末邑人都統張達倡義勇扈從，達妻陳璧娘送至此辭歸，「辭」與「侍」香訛，實「辭郎洲」而非一侍郎洲」也。府志載陳正言侍郎洲辯云：「南澳山北靑徑口有丞相墓，丞相曾為禮部侍郎，此洲之以丞相名也固宜。」又云：「士人讀書稽古，疑則闕之，關之不可，則當從其大者，以見忠臣義士，赤心熟血，百折不回，至勢無可如何，而後驅妻子入海，負帝以殉，若張達夫婦臨岐惜別，事至瑣細，且荒遠無徵，此洲名宜從陸不從張也。」又載周碩勳辭郎洲辯云：「潮郡南澳有洲曰辭郎洲，舊傳宋都統張達扈從帝舟至紅螺山，其妻陳　娘送至此洲，因名。蓋知事之不可爲，必不復返，故不曰送郎而日辭郎也。考綱目：都統張達夜襲元軍敗還。則張達實有其人。又舊傳達殉難崖山，璧娘求得其屍葬之，不食而死，則夫忠婦烈，永訣此地，以事名洲，洲以人傳矣。乃陳正言妄改爲侍郎洲，因以歸之陸。考陸罷居潮州，則直學士院時也，未聞爲禮部侍郎，故所居地曰學士館，今不日學士洲而曰侍郎洲，何耶？」又云：「夫都統官不卑也，凌震都統也，綱目分注書其解甲降元，張達都統也，則書其夜襲元軍，然則張達固十餘萬死屍中之卓卓者，何後人以爲一介編氓也？」兩說於侍郎洲辭郎洲之辯，異同如此。然而周碩勳之識見為卓。其「蓋知不可爲，必不復返，故不曰送郎而曰辭郎。」及「夫忠婦烈，永訣此地，以事名洲，洲以人傳」數語，意味尤深。張達之事，姑元論爲依托假設與否，即此所述，旣哀感，又壯烈，正大好詩題，惜無人形諸　　，以入篇什，供當代諷詠耳。彼陳正言區區以「張達爲海外武夫，前驅效死，亦得附丞相以爭名於千古萬仳」者（上爲陳正言侍郎辯中語），眞俗士也。「海外武夫，前驅效死」，與丞相位望雖殊，爲國禦侮捍患之志則一，何大小之可言？此而不知，誠難乎其爲讀書矣。潮州文士歷來鮮窺史籍，而陳正言其尤哉？（正言饒平人，淸恩貢生。）</p>

<p>渚齋回到家裘，見鳳笙仍穿一件藍布褂，在廚房操作，便一直到臥室裏，在靠床邊一張沙發坐下，心裏暗忖是我發動，還是刺激她由她先發動呢？正在轉念間，鳳笙已走進來，渚齋祗閉上眼睛，好似沒看見一樣。鳳笙自雲卿走後，愈想愈氣，現見渚齋在屋內，對她不理，不由氣往上衝，便站在渚齋面前，兩手向腰間一挿，大聲問道：「渚齋！你是打什麼主意，說明白好了！這樣不陰不陽，我可受不了，我是一個活人，不是死鬼，你不能這樣對待我。」渚齋正閉羨眼睛打主意，一聽這話，認爲機會來了，把兩眼微微一睜，向鳳笙看了一眼道：「你說什麽，什麼人呀，鬼呀，我全不懂！」鳳笙道：「別裝糊塗了，有話說明白，你是存什麼心！你的鬼計，我全知道了，你想把我擱在一旁，不常個人看待，我可不答應。」渚齋道：「我還是不明白。」鳳笙道：「你娶我當太太，却不把我當太太看待，這是什麼意思？」渚齋道：「你眞是我耍娶的那位太太嗎？」渚齋這一句話好似利劍一般，太傷鳳笙的心了，當時在忿恨交加之下，帶着哭聲說道：「你認爲不是你耍娶的那位太太，那末，你和我離婚好了！」渚齋道：「離婚！這是你的意思，不是我逼你離婚。」鳳笙把自己胸脯一拍道：「是的！祗要我的條件，你能承認，我就和你離婚。」渚齋道：「你果然有這膽量，我就答應你。」鳳笙又把胸脯一拍道：「我怕什麼！祗怕我的條件你辦不到。」渚齋道：「你且說來。」鳳笙一手挿在腰間，舉起一手，把大姆指一豎道：「第一條件：要生活費，把現有住宅和一切東西，全歸我所有，由我支配，你不得過問，每月並須給相當數目的生活費，你能辦得到嗎？」渚齋低低應道：「這個可以的。」</p>

<p>隔了一星期後，詹姆士突然接到英國軍部一封公文，要他在下一天到李士德旅館向雷斯脫上校報到。詹姆士當然遵命前去，雷斯脫上校很高興地歡迎他，站在雷斯脫旁邊的却還有一個笑容滿面的大衛尼文。</p>
<p>雷斯脫上校說：「你大槪知道，你的臉很像蒙哥茂利將軍罷？」</p>
<p>接下去是一陣靜默。</p>
<p>雷斯脫對詹姆士打量了一下，問道：「你是不是一個愛國的人？」</p>
<p>詹姆士說：「當然！」</p>
<p>「那麽，請你在這裏簽一個字。」</p>
<p>詹姆士匆匆一瞥，毅然在這份機密文書上簽了字。</p>
<p>大衛尼文說：「詹姆士，我們要你扮演蒙哥茂利將軍。」</p>
<p>詹姆士聽了想笑出來，可是雷斯脫和大衛尼文忽然都已變得神色嚴廂，詹姆士不敢笑了。於是雷斯脫就告訴他，蒙哥茂利將軍在一月前已受盟軍統帥部任命，率領大軍突破歐陸要塞。德國的特務工作人員正在密切注視蒙哥茂利的行動，因爲從他所巡閱的各地區中，可以推算出大概在什麼地方下手。</p>
<p>軍部對詹姆士的要求是很簡單的，他應自即日起和蒙哥茂利將軍接觸，模仿他的聲音，舉動，走路，要使蒙縣茂利的最親近的朋友們都不能辨別眞假。詹姆士一想：這個差使不大好當。可是，他就像排演一齣難演的戲一般，開始了工作。他留起小鬍子，頭髪染白，衣服的肩部　上了「襯頭」，每天留神看蒙哥茂利將軍怎樣吃東西，怎樣梳洗，怎樣睡覺，用些什麼口頭禪。蒙哥茂利將軍自己却高興得像一個小孩子，極熱心的一一敎他。詹姆士喜歡吃蛋，但蒙哥茂利是從不吃蛋的，於是祗好戒掉。他的手指必須擦得毫無黃色的痕跡，因爲蒙哥茂利是不抽烟的。蒙哥茂利不喝酒，詹姆士就戒酒。</p>
<p>一直到到五月下旬，他「上演」了。</p>
<p>那天的早晨，他全身戎裝，勳綬累累，當衆跨上了一部軍用汽車，等汽車開動的時候，但聞羣衆們歡聲雷動！於是他在車窗口對大衆搖搖手，舒服地坐好……</p>
<p>汽軍到了飛機塲。機塲人員肅然立正。飛機門開了，大家敬禮。雷斯脫護衛着他，恭敬地說：「再見，將軍。」又輕輕添一句：「直布羅陀。」詹姆士隨身帶着一個公文包，裏面全是指示，告訴他應見什麼人，說些什麼話。</p>
<p>到了直布羅陀，詹姆士的鷹眼向機塲一掃，飄然下機，直布羅陀總督伊斯和爵士匆匆向前迎迓，詹姆士拍拍他的背心，呌他「老伊」。</p>
<p>他在直布羅陀一直留到黃昏，居然召開軍事會議，舉行授　禮，忙了一天，又飛到了亞爾日耳。在那裏又受到了盛大的歡迎，萬民空巷，采聲雷動但但他到了他的「公館」後，却天天躲在小樓上和他的隨身衛士打牌，聽無綫電。</p>
<p>六月三日，他又在軍警嚴密保護之下，到了飛機塲，這次是到開羅了。在開羅，他玩到了六月七日，已是總攻擊開始的後一天。於是他的任務完畢，欣然回到倫敦。雷斯脫上校一看見他，立刻行了一個漂亮的軍禮，然後送他支票一張，說：「將軍，這是您的薪俸—是照將軍的薪水計算的！」</p>

<h3 id="e1">China and Britain Exchange Compensation Demands in the Kowloon City and Shamian Incidents; London Attempts to Shift the Focus of Negotiations <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 21st] Regarding the Sino-British negotiations, there seems to be another twist on the 21st. After receiving instructions from London, the British Embassy, in the name of Ambassador Stevenson, delivered a written note to our Foreign Minister Wang this morning. The note was not in the form of a protest, but made quite specific demands regarding the Shamian incident in Guangzhou: The Chinese government should be responsible for the Shamian incident; thoroughly investigate the cause of the incident; severely punish the perpetrators; provide generous compensation to the British residents who suffered losses; and guarantee that similar incidents will not occur in the future. Our Ministry of Foreign Affairs remained silent after receiving the note. A reply may be issued within days, informing the British side that the note has been received, but a specific response may not be presented in the short term. Regarding the Kowloon City issue, there was no progress on the 21st. The Ministry hopes to receive a reply from the British side within the week. It is understood that the British side's measures on the 21st seem to be an attempt to shift the focus of negotiations to the Shamian incident. Our side still believes that the Kowloon City and Shamian incidents are causally related, and the Kowloon City issue should be resolved as soon as possible based on the two principles of not abandoning our country's jurisdiction and restoring the freedom of the arrested people, and that the injured people receive compensation.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 20th] Minister of State McNeil, when answering questions from members of parliament in the House of Commons on the 20th, mentioned the Guangzhou incident and anti-British demonstrations throughout China.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Nanjing, 21st] The Ministry of Foreign Affairs submitted a note to the British Embassy on the night of the 21st, demanding compensation for all the losses of the Chinese whose houses were demolished in Kowloon. The British Embassy has forwarded the note to London, and a response should be received soon. It is noted that the British originally regarded the Guangzhou incident and the Kowloon incident as two separate incidents. However, the note submitted by the Chinese government tonight indicates that it will regard the two as the same incident. Furthermore, it is also the first time that the Chinese government has raised the issue of compensation.</p>
<p>[United Press, Nanjing, 21st] Shi Zhaoying, Director of the Intelligence Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, stated at a press conference on the 21st that the Chinese government will handle the recent losses of British property in Guangzhou in accordance with the general principles of international law. The Kowloon City incident involves fundamental jurisdictional issues. The National Government was forced to make demands regarding the status of Kowloon City and the arrest or injury of residents by the Hong Kong police based on jurisdictional grounds, and as a result of Hong Kong's illegal firing in Kowloon City.</p>
<h3 id="e2">School Groups from Chongqing, Xiamen, Guangzhou, and Taiwan Express Condolences to the Compatriots in Distress in Kowloon City; Urge the Government to Negotiate for the Recovery of Hong Kong and Kowloon <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>

All universities in the country will jointly file a complaint with the United Nations against this brutality by Hong Kong.</p>
<p>[Our Xiamen Dispatch, 21st] Seven overseas Chinese groups in Xiamen City expressed extreme indignation at the Hong Kong government's unreasonable demolition of houses in Kowloon City and forced eviction of residents. At 3 pm on the 20th, they convened a joint meeting to send a telegram to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to lodge a serious protest with the Hong Kong government and negotiate for the recovery of sovereignty over Hong Kong and Kowloon.</p>
<p>[Our Guangzhou Dispatch, 21st] The Guangdong-Guangzhou Kowloon City Support Association held an emergency meeting and decided:  Regarding the Shamian incident, urge the government to pay attention to the issue of responsibility.  Please release the arrested suspects immediately. Furthermore, more than 100 suspects arrested in Shamian have mostly been released, with only about 20 remaining, of whom nine are suspected of being more serious and are being interrogated.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Hong Kong, 21st] Kowloon City was still calm and uneventful on the 21st. About 40 residents (mostly males) came and went in the area, not obstructed by the Kowloon police who were guarding the city. The Kowloon City Residents Association held a meeting on the 21st and resolved to ask each resident to submit a photo to determine the number of residents and households in the city. Another condolence group from Guangzhou arrived here on the 21st. The group was composed of representatives from the Guangzhou branch of several overseas Chinese groups. They will inspect Kowloon City on the 21st and present condolences to our countrymen who have been expelled from their homes.</p>

Most journalists circled Chen Xun's name on the ballot and left, predicting that he would get the most votes.</p>
<p>[Our Fuzhou Dispatch, 21st] On the first day of the Legislative Yuan elections, the candidates campaigned enthusiastically.

A certain general who arrived later hired rickshaws to carry images and promote along the street. Some candidates went to the countryside to give speeches. There were not many voters at the polling stations. The press lost its voting rights and had some disputes, which are being mediated by Zheng Jiemin, the Civil Affairs Director.</p>
<p>[Our Taipei Dispatch, 21st] On the first day of the Legislative Yuan elections, the atmosphere was obviously less enthusiastic than during the National Assembly elections.

Journalists all voted for Chen Xunnian, Chen Bosheng, and Cheng Cangbo. Reporters from various newspapers stood guard outside the polling station to solicit votes.

<p>[Our Nanchang Dispatch, 21st] On the first day of the Legislative Yuan elections, Nanchang City was divided into eleven polling stations.

Mei is currently serving as a judge at the Far East Military Tribunal in Japan. There are only his campaign slogans here. Liu has gone to Ji'an and other places to participate in campaign activities.

<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 21st] Regarding private enterprises applying for government guarantees for foreign loans, there is still a lack of review standards and supervision methods, which need to be uniformly stipulated. The Ministries of Foreign Affairs, Finance, Economy, Transportation, and the Central Bank have met to discuss and agree that if a private enterprise applies for a government guarantee for a foreign loan, if the enterprise cannot repay the debt, the government must fulfill its guarantee responsibility. Therefore, this guarantee is tantamount to increasing the government's debt. However, China's industrial and enterprises are still in their infancy, and borrowing foreign capital is essential. In order to support private enterprises, it is necessary to guarantee their foreign loans. Therefore, the principles of review standards and supervision methods were discussed and determined. After being approved by the Executive Yuan, the Ministry of Economic Affairs and the Central Bank and other agencies jointly drafted the "Measures for Private Enterprises to Apply for Government Guarantees for Foreign Loans," which were approved by the Executive Yuan for implementation. The original text is as follows:</p>
<p>Article 1: Private enterprises applying for government guarantees for foreign loans shall apply in accordance with the provisions of these measures. Article 2: Private enterprises applying for government shall meet the following conditions and apply to the competent authority:  Articles of Association of the enterprise organization and registration date,  Balance sheet and profit and loss statement for the most recent three years,  Draft loan agreement,  Use of loan and repayment method.  Whether the product is exported and estimated foreign exchange income,  National Bank guarantee deposit. Article 3: The competent authority, when it deems it necessary to apply for the above-mentioned guaranteed loan, shall send the original documents to the Ministry of Finance for review. After the review is in compliance, it shall be submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval. The Ministry of Finance shall then transfer it to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to notify the foreign government to approve the guarantee, or the Ministry of Finance shall directly guarantee it to the foreign bank. Article 4: After the loan contract is signed, the private enterprise shall separately copy and submit it to the competent authority of the Ministry of Finance and the Central Bank for reference. Article 5: The review of private enterprises applying for government guarantees for foreign loans shall be in line with the national industrial policy, and the priority order is as follows: (A) The loan is used to purchase export materials and equipment, and the product can be exchanged for foreign exchange; (B) The loan is used to purchase master machines to manufacture production tools, which can indirectly save foreign exchange expenditures; (C) The loan is used to purchase domestic necessary production equipment. Article 6: The loan repayment period shall be proportional to the loan amount, and the shortest shall not be less than five years. Article 7: Private enterprises with government-guaranteed loans shall deposit all foreign exchange earned from the sale of their products in the guaranteeing bank for the payment of principal and interest due on the loan. Article 8: Before the loan is repaid, the private enterprises shall submit their annual final accounts to the competent authority of the Ministry of Finance, and may send personnel to audit the business situation. The guarantee bank shall independently negotiate the audit methods for the guaranteed loan enterprise. Article 9: These measures shall be implemented after promulgation.</p>

<p>[Our Chengdu Dispatch, 20th] In order to strengthen troop training, the central government will set up training offices in the Southwest, Northwest, North China, and Taiwan.

<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 21st] Shi Zhaoying, Director of the Intelligence Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, admitted at a press conference on the 21st that it is possible to conclude an agreement between China and Portugal similar to the Sino-Hong Kong Customs Agreement, but said that such an agreement cannot be negotiated by the Guangzhou local authorities and the Macau authorities.

<h3 id="e15">This Year's Cotton Purchase Reduced to Three Million Dan; Detailed Rules for Cotton Yarn Cloth Control Being Reviewed by the Ministry of Economic Affairs <a href="#e15" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c15" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">15</a></h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 21st] The plan originally formulated by the Cotton Yarn Cloth Management Committee to purchase cotton was to purchase 5 million dan. Now, due to the lack of cotton sources, this year it will be reduced to 3 million dan. Calculated at the current market price, each dan of cotton is 5.6 million yuan. Purchasing 3 million dan of cotton requires 16.8 trillion yuan. After Yuan Liang discussed with Zhang Jia'ao, it is heard that Zhang has agreed to invest 10 trillion yuan in loans from the Central Bank. In addition to the 2 trillion yuan that has been allocated first, the rest will be allocated successively. All these loans are guaranteed by the Ministry of Economic Affairs.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 21st] The Ministry of Economic Affairs started reviewing the detailed rules for the implementation of the cotton yarn cloth control measures on the 20th. The detailed rules for the implementation of the unified purchase of cotton have been passed on the 20th. On the 21st, the review will continue to revise the detailed rules for the implementation of cotton yarn spinning and the detailed rules for the implementation of cotton cloth weaving. There are still three parts, including the detailed rules for the distribution of cotton cloth, which are scheduled to be reviewed at a continued meeting on the 22nd, and are expected to be completed on the 22nd. The review meeting on the 21st was still presided over by Liu Siying. Regarding the spinning part, several points have been revised: The profit for spinning work used to be calculated on the basis of 259 and a half pounds of cotton (20 counts of raw materials), and the legal currency was paid according to the price approved by the Management Committee. Now it is changed to be paid according to the market price converted into legal currency. Simplify the procedures. The original implementation rules stipulated that yarn merchants should first exchange the cotton yarn warehouse receipt for the cotton allocation certificate, and then exchange the cotton allocation certificate for the cotton warehouse receipt. The cotton allocation certificate has been canceled during the review on the 21st, reducing one layer of procedures. In addition, it is learned that regarding the part of the resident factory specialists in the implementation rules, after careful consideration by the relevant authorities, it is believed that there are more than 600 yarn factories in the country. If two resident factory specialists are sent to each factory, more than 1,000 people will be needed, which is worthy of consideration in terms of economy and technology.

<h3 id="e24">After Japan Abolished the "Four-Party Policy Agreement" <a href="#e24" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c24" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">24</a></h3>
<p>January this year has become a political season for Japan. This month, there are two conferences that have a significant impact on the Japanese political situation, regarding the success or failure of the Katayama Cabinet. One is the third plenary session of the Socialist Party held on the 16th, and the other is the second Diet convened on the 21st. The Socialist Party is the largest party in Japan, and its chairman, Katayama, is the current Prime Minister. Since the party's victory in the election last April, it has been plagued by internal divisions between the left and right wings, as well as attacks from the Liberal Party led by Yoshida and the Democratic Party led by Shidehara. This has led to the Katayama Cabinet's indecisiveness in implementing policies. General public opinion and polls have predicted that the Katayama Cabinet will have difficulty surviving the January crisis, and that the party congress will undergo major changes in personnel and policies, and may even trap Katayama in a dilemma. On the 19th, the party congress overturned the "Four-Party Policy Agreement," which served as the basis for Katayama's joint government plan, by a margin of 21 votes. Domestic and foreign commentators believe this is a fatal blow to the Katayama Cabinet. The Democratic Party and the Liberal Party believe this is a major event for the Socialist Party, and the direction of the Katayama Cabinet is worthy of attention. Undoubtedly, this major event is a change in the Socialist Party's policy, which will affect the progress of the second Diet. But what is the truth of this event? Will the Katayama Cabinet retreat immediately? It is worth paying attention to.</p>
<p>The Japanese Socialist Party is a political party representing the working masses, and its mass base is built on the majority of workers and peasants. The party adheres to socialism and firmly upholds the principles of democracy and freedom. Since Japan surrendered, its organization has expanded, and its strength is strong. Last year, the new constitution was implemented, and a general election was held nationwide. The party defeated the far-left Communist Party, the right-wing Liberal Party, and the center-leaning-right Democratic Party, the Cooperative Party, and other parties, winning 408 seats in local councils (prefectures), 48 seats in the House of Councillors of the central parliament, and 143 seats in the House of Representatives, rising to become the largest party in Japan. According to the new party regulations, the Prime Minister must be elected by the majority party, so the party chairman, Katayama Tetsuo, took office as the "commoner Prime Minister" of the new constitutional government with the support of a majority of votes in the House of Representatives, and is still in office for less than a year. At that time, Katayama's appearance was due to the support of the entire Socialist Party, as well as the support of the Ashida faction of the Democratic Party and the Cooperative Party. Now, the Katayama Cabinet is centered on the Socialist, Democratic, and Cooperative parties.</p>
<p>According to Katayama's ambition at the time, the government implementing the new constitution should be a coalition government without the Communist Party. Therefore, before the personnel arrangement, he made many efforts to win the cooperation of Yoshida Shigeru of the Liberal Party, and did not hesitate to make the greatest concessions on the policies announced by the Socialist Party before the election, and the four-party common policy drafted after the election results were announced. On May 16, the so-called "Four-Party Policy Agreement" was established, which is divided into the following nine items: 1. In order to break through the economic crisis, a comprehensive plan may be drawn up to implement state management, taking into account the current economic organization when necessary; 2. In order to increase production, adopt a super-priority industrial policy, and implement state management of important basic industries when necessary. However, its management should abolish the bureaucratic control method and implement it in a democratic manner; 3. Industrial revitalization must be carried out with the active cooperation of entrepreneurs and workers; 4. In order to overcome inflation, adopt sound financial measures and implement financial control when necessary; 5. The government will increase the special burden on those who become rich by taking advantage of inflation or black market transactions. However, the plan to freeze new yen deposits or stop interest payments on national bonds will be abolished; 6. Place wages and prices under strict control, and implement a strict rationing system for the scarce parts of daily necessities, ensure the supply of fertilizers and agricultural tools and other necessities for rural areas to increase food production, and improve the purchase system as soon as possible to fully obtain the purchase quota; 7. In order to rebuild industry and stabilize people's livelihood, thoroughly eliminate black market transactions and fully improve sea and land transportation capacity; 8. In view of the fact that overcoming the crisis is more difficult than the awakening of the national consciousness of national salvation, special attention should be paid to promoting the elevation of national morality and the renovation of culture and education. These nine policies are mostly biased towards the economic aspect, and their focus is on the nationalization of important industries, financial control, wage and price control, and the protection of the working masses, and the crackdown and exclusion of the bullies. However, the item of not agreeing to freeze new yen deposits or stop interest payments on national bonds is intended to protect the wealth of a few vested interests, which is a compromise with conservative forces. This economic policy is neither completely socialist nor free capitalist. It can be called a reform of modified socialism, or a revision of capitalism. Yoshida of the Liberal Party and Shidehara of the Democratic Party did not have much opinion on the content of the "Four-Party Policy Agreement." What they insisted on was the arrangement of personnel. As a result, the agreement was established, but the Liberal Party and Shidehara did not participate in the coalition government, but this agreement has always been the route followed by the Katayama Cabinet.</p>
<p>This time, the Socialist Party congress overturned the "Four-Party Policy Agreement," indicating the strength of the party's left-wing forces, posing a new threat to Katayama and Suehiro Nishio. The Socialist Party has always been divided into left and right wings, and the right wing has both radical and gradual factions. "Nichino" is in the hands of the left-wing Kanjyu Kato, while the leadership of "Zennou" is in the hands of Rizo Hirano. Hirano is a radical of the right wing, and was the former Minister of Agriculture of the Katayama Cabinet. He was dismissed due to discord with the Cabinet Secretary General Nishio. Hirano then called on the backbone of "Zennou" and a small number of factions of the Cooperative Party to create a new Kanro Party movement, intending to divide the Socialist Party; recently, he launched 16 members of the House of Representatives of the Socialist Party to withdraw from the party, hoping to dismantle the first party's position in the House of Representatives, which once set off serious political waves. Katayama Nishio took emergency measures and rectified Hirano on the eve of the Socialist Party congress, and notified the House of Representatives to inform Hirano to resign voluntarily before the 21st. This time, the Hirano issue and the merger issue of "Nichino" and "Zennou" were listed as the main issues. It may be the rising anti-Nishio movement within the party, and the decision to abolish the "Four-Party Policy Agreement" shows that the majority of the party gave Nishio a major revolt victory. The development of this event will inevitably cause difficulties for the Katayama Cabinet.</p>
<p>However, this does not immediately mean that the Katayama Cabinet is on the verge of collapse. First, the "Four-Party Policy Agreement" is a policy agreement of the coalition government, not a complete party agreement. The Katayama Cabinet does not need to insist on this agreement, and may even re-establish a three-party policy agreement that lives up to its name. In fact, Katayama and Ashida are studying new policies to cope with the Allied peace conference with Japan. Last year's "Four-Party Policy Agreement" has long lost its effect in terms of the situation; second, in this Socialist Party congress, the left wing won in policy decisions, but in personnel changes, the right wing made a comeback and still won the leadership of the party, which shows that the left wing's attempt has been shattered. According to the results of the party's election on the evening of the 19th, in addition to Katayama being re-elected as the chairman, right-wing candidate Inajiro Asanuma defeated left-wing candidate Kanjyu Kato and was elected as the party's secretary-general, and centrist candidate Satoshi Nakazaki defeated left-wing candidate Matsuzuki Tanaka and was elected as the treasurer, presiding over the party's finance and accounting. In short, the right-wing personnel's holding of the leadership is a powerful explanation of the strength of the Socialist Party's right wing, and Katayama has overcome a difficulty in this crisis. In the future, the changes in the Japanese political situation within January will depend on the development of the second Diet.</p>
<p>How will Katayama cope with the undercurrents of the new Diet? He may propose new policies to win the support of the Diet. If the Diet supports the new policies, the government can stabilize. If it fails, he may dissolve the Diet and hold new general elections to let public opinion decide the fate of the government.</p>
<h3 id="e25">The Brutal Killing of Foreign Missionaries Exposes the True Face of the Communist Bandits; Dong Xianguang Talks at a Press Conference <a href="#e25" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c25" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">25</a></h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing Dispatch, 21st] Director Dong Xianguang said at a press conference on the 21st:</p>
<p>The case of the Hubei bandit army's wandering troops brutally killing three Lutheran foreign missionaries has fully revealed the illegal and chaotic situation in the Communist area, and can show that the Communists have abandoned their disguise and exposed their true face, attempting to intimidate the good people into engaging in rebellion by burning, killing, torturing, and slaughtering, and harming religious personnel. The existence of this terrible situation was previously obscured by the Communists' subtle propaganda, and foreign countries did not know much about it, but the truth of the facts has now been exposed, and modern civilization in the Communist area is feared to be completely bankrupt. Today, the number of men, women, and children who have escaped from areas under the pressure of the Communist army is no less than 500,000. These refugees have traveled around and lived a hard life, and many have fled to major cities, seeking refuge, causing the cities to be filled with internal refugees, forming the world's most serious relief problem today. The majority of these refugees are from poor families, and their lives are completely dependent on government relief. This not only increases the government's burden, but also worsens into a huge social problem. Today, concerning the people, all have the right to be elected, but this supplementary method of party nomination restricts party members from participating in the election on their own. I wonder how the party committee will interpret this order?</p>
<p>(Answer) The supplementary method of party nomination stipulates that party members must be nominated by the party to be candidates, which is to protect the right to be elected of ordinary citizens, and is the common practice in European and American democratic countries, and does not conflict with our country's constitution.</p>
<p>(Question) Can you tell us the reason why the government withdrew some personnel from Shenyang?</p>
<p>(Answer) At present, only the families of the technical personnel of the National Resources Commission in the Shenyang area are being evacuated. After some important industrial and mining areas in the Northeast fell into the hands of the bandits or were destroyed, most of the technical personnel have been dismissed. At the same time, factories in other areas of the country are in urgent need of these talents, so the relevant authorities have decided to transfer the above-mentioned personnel to work in other areas when needed.</p>
<p>(Question) Has the Central Propaganda Department instructed the party newspapers on the editorial position to be taken on the Kowloon Incident? If so, what is its nature?</p>
<p>(Answer) This question seems to be for the Central Propaganda Department.</p>

<p>[Our Guangzhou Dispatch, 21st] Weng Wenhao, chairman of the National Resources Commission, had a long talk with Song Ziwen on the 21st. The content was generally about the development of Guangdong's industries. It is heard that the important decisions include: 1.

<p>[Our Hangzhou Dispatch, 21st] The Liangjiadu Bridge is more than 500 meters long and is the first large bridge on the Zhegan Road between Hangzhou and Nanchang, except for the Qiantang River Bridge. It will be completed within days, and Hangzhou and Nanchang can be directly connected. Director Hou Jiayuan said that the Hangzhou-Nanchang traffic on the road is imminent and will leave for Shangrao and Nanchang on the 22nd to inspect.</p>
<p>[Another Telegram] The Zhegan Road needs more than 6,000 tons of coal per month, and receives 4,000 tons of allocated coal per month. The self-produced coal from the Kengkou Coal Mine is less than 100 tons. There is still a shortage of more than 1,000 tons per month. Purchasing from various mines in Jiangxi Province is difficult due to transportation and economic issues. Currently, there is no coal in stock on the road. If the allocated coal or purchased coal is not continued, there will be a danger of stopping the train. In addition, the road project is progressing very quickly, the route is increasing, and Hangzhou and Nanchang are about to be connected, but the lack of vehicles on the road is a major problem. We are currently planning countermeasures day and night.</p>
<h3 id="e34">Loss of Duty Case of Yu Ying-chieh, Director of the Examination Department of the Import Control Commission, Decided Not to be Subject to Disciplinary Action by the Disciplinary Committee for Public Officials <a href="#e34" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c34" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">34</a></h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 21st] The case of Yu Ying-chieh, Director of the Examination Department for Non-Quota Imports of the Provisional Import Control Commission, who was accused of dereliction of duty, was referred by the Control Yuan to the Central Public Officials Disciplinary Committee for disciplinary action. It has now been resolved that Yu Ying-chieh will not be subject to disciplinary action. The reason given is that the original accusation concerned the Zhonghe Paper Mill's application to purchase paper-making machines and printing presses, all of which were urgently needed industrial products. The Fund Department had already approved their purchase abroad, and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs had issued passports for travel to the United States to place orders. Yu Ying-chieh, as the Director of the Examination Department for Non-Quota Imports of the Provisional Import Control Commission, delayed approving foreign exchange, thereby delaying production, which was deemed a dereliction of duty. However, according to the defense: "Upon investigation, the Zhonghe Paper Mill's application to import paper-making and printing machinery involved a total of US$300,9903.75, which was considered a substantial amount. The responsible department submitted the original case to the Advisory Committee of the Commission for a decision, with a signed note stating, 'Experts should be consulted for review first, and the factory's performance last year should be investigated before a decision is made.' It was noted that 'the factory's expansion is still needed, but the paper-making machine to be ordered is found to be second-hand, and its production capacity is not as high as estimated. Furthermore, the factory's power supply is insufficient and needs to be supplemented by the Shanghai Electric Power Company.' Previously, Mr. Qu Lang, Consultant to the Executive Yuan, conducted a detailed investigation and research on the domestic paper-making industry and submitted a proposal stating, 'The existing equipment in paper mills throughout China is not being fully utilized. At present, priority should be given to supplementing parts and raw materials to promote resumption of work and increased production. As for applications for equipment expansion, they should be deferred due to limited foreign exchange reserves.' Consultant Qu Lang held the same opinion on the Zhonghe case. Subsequently, the matter was submitted to the 37th Executive Committee of the Commission for review and discussion. The committee members unanimously agreed with the opinions provided by various experts and rejected the case. The Provisional Management Department then notified the company of the rejection based on the resolution. The company resubmitted a petition on August 16 of this year, stating its reasons and requesting reconsideration. The matter was again reviewed at the 6th Business Meeting on October 6, which upheld the original decision to reject the case." Since the case had already undergone extensive consultation with experts and had been reviewed and approved for rejection by both the Executive Committee and the Business Meeting of the Commission, the responsible person in charge of the department could not change the decision.</p>

According to the foreign members of the committee, they hope to increase staff salaries and reduce the number of personnel to increase staff efficiency. However, it is reported that Vice President Wang Yunwu of the Executive Yuan does not agree with increasing staff salaries, so the matter has not yet been resolved. Xiang Jingyun, Chief Secretary of the Custody Committee, recently went to Beijing to seek instructions and discussed the issue of employee salaries. Xiang returned to Shanghai by overnight train last night and will attend the committee meeting this morning.</p>

<h3 id="e42">Ministry of National Defense News Bureau Releases Weekly War Situation Perspective: No Large-Scale Contact on Any Battlefield <a href="#e42" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c42" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">42</a></h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 21st] The News Bureau of the Ministry of National Defense released a weekly perspective on the war situation from January 15th to 21st on the 21st. The full text is as follows:</p>
<p>The overall war situation this week was slightly calmer than last week. This is because the Communist troops across the board have been battered by the National Army and are undergoing reorganization and replenishment in the Northeast. In North China, they are under pressure from the North China Bandit Suppression Headquarters and have no choice but to rely on the cover of the Taihang Mountains and the newly dug tunnels and rat holes. Apart from occasional sneak attacks and guerrilla warfare, the main force is also dormant. In particular, the Communist troops under Liu Bocheng, Chen Yi, and Chen Geng in Central China have been dispersed everywhere to avoid decisive battles with the main force. In southern Shanxi, the Communist troops, with a force of more than 40,000 men, could not even hold on to the Zhongtiao Mountains, which they claimed as their base area, and fled north in droves. The remnants of Liu Bocheng's troops, consisting of the 2nd, 3rd, and 6th Columns, are also scattered and fleeing in the Dabie Mountains. Therefore, apart from the National Army's mopping-up operations, there has been no large-scale contact on any battlefield this week.</p>
<p>However, this temporary calm will not last long. This is precisely what the Communist leader Mao Zedong instructed the Communist troops to do: "Preserve strength," "Avoid strength and attack weakness," and "Obtain rest." But he does not know that the National Army will not allow the Communists to breathe.</p>
<p>Based on the statistics of the war results we have obtained from all parties since the beginning of the new year, according to incomplete reports, from the end of December to the middle of this month, the Northeast has crushed the Communist troops of the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 6th, 7th, 8th, and 10th Columns in the areas on both sides of the Liao River and southern Liaoning, and they can no longer act rashly.</p>
<p>In North China, more than 4,100 people were killed, wounded, or surrendered from the end of December to the middle of this month. In the Central China battlefield, the statistics for one month show that more than 31,000 Communist troops were killed or wounded, and more than 4,200 surrendered and were captured (the results of the battles in western and eastern Henan have not yet been included). It can be imagined that the Communist troops' fleeing tactics still cannot avoid significant sacrifices. Now, in order to boost the morale that has been declining, they are again cheering up the Communist troops' cadres in various units, shouting the slogans of "Preparing for a counter-offensive," "Preserving existing bases," and "Expanding enlistment," intending to continue their last-ditch struggle.</p>
<p>In the aforementioned search and pursuit operations of the National Army, the local militias in western Henan heroically demonstrated the valiant achievements of "Protecting the homeland" and "Fighting traitors and bandits." In Deng County, more than 4,000 local militias resisted the attack of two columns of the Communist Geng's troops, plus the remnants of the 10th Column under Liu Bocheng, totaling more than 24,000 men, for as long as twelve days. On the 16th of this month, they joined forces with the National Army and local militias who came to their aid and safely retreated to Mengjialou and other places northwest of Deng County. The Communist troops' call to "Eliminate the local militias" did not achieve its goal, but they lost as many as 6,000 men in the attack on Deng County. This proves to what extent the Chinese peasants' mood of struggle against the Communist bandits has reached.</p>
<p>Summarizing the overall bandit suppression military affairs of the past week, we can see that the war situation of bandit suppression has gradually entered a new stage.</p>

<h3 id="e43">First Meeting of the Four Powers After the Foreign Ministers' Conference, Inauguration of the Berlin Allied Control Council, Soviet Representative Accuses the Merger of British and American Zones of Violating the Agreement, U.S. Side Demands Reform of the German Currency System <a href="#e43" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c43" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">43</a></h3>
<p>[Reuters Berlin, 20th] The Berlin Four-Power Allied Control Council held its first meeting here today after the failure of the Four-Power London Foreign Ministers' Conference. According to reliable sources, the U.S. delegation presented the Frankfurt agreement on the new economic and administrative measures for the British-American merged zone during the meeting. The Soviet delegation immediately read a prepared statement, pointing out that the agreement violated the Potsdam Agreement and demanded its abolition, but did not indicate that this demand was an ultimatum. At the end of the plenary session, U.S. Army General Clay requested a restrictive meeting with each delegation attending with a maximum of four people. This meeting lasted only ten minutes, during which General Clay raised the demand for implementing a German currency reform. Today's meeting was chaired by British Army Lieutenant General Robertson, and the atmosphere was sincere. Allied delegation officials all stated afterward that the meeting was no different from previous meetings. French Army General Koenig, due to other business, excused himself before the end of the meeting and was replaced by his deputy. At the beginning of the meeting, General Clay first reported on the general situation of the Frankfurt Agreement and stated that the meeting held in Frankfurt only involved economic issues and was unrelated to politics. He promised that he would soon submit the detailed content of the agreement to the Allied Control Council.</p>

<p>After Clay's statement, Soviet Army Marshal Sokolovsky stood up and first thanked Clay for his report, and then took a long two-page typed statement to express the Soviet Union's views on the agreement, saying that the Soviet delegation believed that the Frankfurt agreement was a further step toward dividing Germany and establishing a West German state, completely ignoring the institutions of the Allied Control Council during the process, which violated the Potsdam Agreement. He also pointed out that the British-American zone agreement did not have the support or participation of German democratic elements, or even the participation of non-democratic German elements, such as German Social Democratic leader Schumacher, Soviet zone Christian Democratic leader Kaiser (who was recently dismissed by the Soviet authorities), and British zone Christian Democratic leader Adenauer (in fact, none of these three participated in the Frankfurt meeting). Finally, he said that the Soviet Union's demand was to stop the implementation of the British-American merged zone plan, which violated the Potsdam Agreement and the Allied Control Council agreement. Sokolovsky spoke for ten minutes, with a calm and courteous attitude. At this point, General Koenig excused himself and left, and after thanking General Clay for his report, he promised to convey it to the French government. British Army Lieutenant General Robertson then stated that General Clay's statement was made on behalf of the United Kingdom and the United States, and said that the Frankfurt Declaration was divided into two parts, one was a general statement, and the other was the content of the new suggestions announced by Clay, both of which were joint statements of the British-American merged zone. General Clay finally stood up again to declare that the new suggestions of the merged zone did not violate the Potsdam Agreement, and promised to submit the details of the merged zone resolution to the Allied Control Council soon.</p>

<h3 id="e45">Soviet Army Commander Has Denied Saying That the United Kingdom and the United States Should Withdraw From Berlin, Soviet Union Will Launch an Offensive Against the British and American Zones <a href="#e45" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c45" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">45</a></h3>
<p>[Central News Agency Berlin, 20th, United Press] When the Soviet Army Commander explained how the Soviet policy would suddenly change at the important meeting of the Allied Control Council, he denied the newspaper's claim that the Soviet Union would demand that the Western Allies withdraw from Berlin.</p>
<p>[Reuters Berlin, 21st] Sources here believe that after the Soviet Union protested the new resolution of the British-American merged zone at the Allied Control Council meeting yesterday, the Soviet press will continue to launch a strong offensive against the "West German state."</p>
<p>At the same time, the "German People's Congress" led by the Socialist Unity Party will also launch propaganda for "unifying Germany." If the Soviet Union's demand to stop the implementation of the new resolution of the British-American merged zone encounters the resolute refusal of the United Kingdom and the United States, the Soviet Union may consider taking measures such as implementing currency reform in East Germany and demanding that the Western Allies withdraw from Berlin. However, these measures will be taken only when the Soviet Union feels that the situation has deteriorated to an irreparable point. The "German People's Congress" will demand a nationwide referendum in the general assembly in March this year to decide on the unification of Germany. According to people close to the Socialist Unity Party, a more moderate action that Marshal Sokolovsky could take would be to delay time. Although the Soviet Union has not issued an ultimatum, it has made specific and definite demands. It is expected that Marshal Sokolovsky will reiterate his demands at future Allied Control Council meetings and indicate that the Soviet Union may be willing to compromise if the decisions of the British-American merged zone can be revised. If the United Kingdom and the United States still refuse, the Soviet Union will not hesitate to announce its counter-measures.</p>
<h3 id="e46">German Labor Strikes Spreading <a href="#e46" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c46" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">46</a></h3>
<p>[United Press Nuremberg, 21st] 20,000 German workers in the American-occupied area of the Ruhr began a strike on the 21st to protest the shortage of food. More than 100,000 workers in Cologne in the Rhineland also responded to the hunger strike. 30,000 metallurgical workers in Nuremberg began a half-day strike from noon on the 21st. According to union leaders, workers throughout the city, except for transportation workers, will participate. Nuremberg has a population of 400,000. Because the government refused to accept the Bavarian union's seven-point food collection plan, at least 30,000 strikers will hold demonstrations.</p>
<p>[Reuters Cologne, 21st] 100,000 workers in Cologne will hold a 24-hour strike today to protest the lack of food. The number of strikers in various parts of the British-occupied area of Germany will now reach at least 110,000. Cologne's postal, telecommunications, railway, and gas workers will not participate in the strike, but tram workers have been on strike for 36 hours. Construction workers in Wences County are also striking due to lack of food. The number of strikers in Wiesbaden has reached 9,000. Tram workers in Dortmund are already on strike. It is expected that the strike of 100,000 factory workers in Cologne will trigger labor strikes throughout the Ruhr region.</p>

The agency was established privately without police permission and is an illegal organization that can no longer publish publications. About a month ago, a Yugoslav patriotic group in France was also banned from activities by the French authorities.</p>
<h3 id="e49">If the U.S. Is Unwilling to Aid Western Europe, the Soviet Union Will Sweep Across Europe, Dulles Advocates a Western Hemisphere Joint Defense <a href="#e49" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c49" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">49</a></h3>
<p>[Reuters Washington, 20th] Republican foreign policy advisor Dulles attended the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on the 20th to present his views on the European Recovery Program. He said: The free countries of Europe, after suffering serious wounds caused by the war, are gradually recovering, and the Soviet leaders are using various methods other than war to make it a fatal wound. Unless the United States helps these free countries to recover their health, it is feared that the Soviet leaders' plan will eventually succeed.</p>
<p>The goal of the Marshall Plan is not only to help others out of trouble, but also to safeguard the interests of the United States itself. The Soviet leaders believe that the free system in Europe is in a precarious state, and a slight push can push it into the abyss. The Communist Party is sitting on the sidelines, ready to provide this blow. The political disunity in Europe has caused economic turmoil. If the Western European countries, including Germany, can have organizations such as customs unions and currency unions, coupled with the aid materials provided by the United States, the current state of poverty can be transformed into a state of well-being. At the same time, the Western European countries must also have appropriate political unity to make them a solid front sufficient to cope with any emergency. Therefore, the Western European countries should establish a regional convention similar to the Western Hemisphere Joint Defense Treaty within the framework of the United Nations. Western European unity is one of the main points of the Marshall Plan and the reason why the Soviet leaders criticize it. The Soviet leaders know that a divided Western Europe and a desperate economic situation can make its people accept the Soviet Union's will. On the contrary, 250 million united Western European people can never be conquered by any force. Dulles then mentioned the West German issue and demanded a clear definition of the role of West Germany in the European Recovery Program. He pointed out that the Soviet Union already has a certain plan to determine the relationship between Poland and East Germany, waiting for the approval of the peace conference. Therefore, the people of East Germany and Poland have great confidence in the future and can carry out their economic plans. As far as France, the Netherlands, Belgium and other countries are concerned, their pre-war economies were closely linked to Germany, so they should know the future state of the Ruhr and other regions.</p>

<p>[Reuters, London, 21st] Well-informed sources say that discussions among the three powers of Britain, America, and France on the administration of West Germany will be held in London next week. France has expressed its agreement to hold these negotiations. French Ambassador Massigli will bring the formal consent of the French government when he returns to London from Paris today. Discussions between the British government and the United States on holding this meeting have not yet been completed. Britain believes that it would be very useful to discuss the administrative plans for the Anglo-American merged zone, especially the six-point plan to expand the authority of the German Economic Council in the merged zone.</p>
<h3 id="e51">American Government in Germany Should Be Under the Command of the State Department <a href="#e51" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c51" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">51</a></h3>
<p>The American occupation government in Germany, regarding the supply for the European Recovery Program, is above any other European country. To facilitate the execution of this task, the American occupation government should quickly be placed under the command of the State Department. Marshall cannot jointly formulate West German economic policy with Bevin and Bidault on an equal basis during the period of military control in West Germany, so this situation should be quickly rectified. Dulles finally said: the United States does not want to assist Europe if it falls under foreign dictatorship, and the Soviet Union is about to sweep across Europe. At that time, the cost of military equipment needed by the United States, compared with the expenditure of the Marshall Plan, would be no more than "a bag of peanuts."</p>

<p>[Associated Press, Tokyo, 21st] The second session of the new Japanese Diet opened on the 21st. The Emperor attended and delivered an opening address, acknowledging the Diet as Japan's highest authority and calling on all members of the Diet and the Japanese people to strive for the world's trust.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 21st] This morning, the opening ceremony of the Japanese Diet was held, and communist members attended. Since its establishment, the Japanese Communist Party has refused to attend the opening ceremony, considering it shameful that when the Emperor enters the parliament to read the imperial rescript, all members of the Diet must bow to him. The imperial rescript issued by the Emperor at this morning's opening ceremony was much more humble in its wording than in the past. The previously common term "subjects" has been changed to "both sovereigns."</p>
<p>[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 21st] After the resumption of the second Japanese Diet, the Japanese House of Representatives and the House of Councillors will hold a formal meeting at 3:00 PM on the 22nd, at which time Prime Minister Katayama will deliver a policy speech, followed by questions from members of various parties. The first item on the agenda is the new budget issue.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Tokyo, 21st] Japanese Education Minister Katayama told the Associated Press on the 21st that the government's policy is not left-leaning. Although many problems are very difficult, he has decided to continue in power and has no intention of resigning.</p>

<p>[Associated Press, Tokyo, 21st] Japanese Senate Vice-President, Socialist Party left-wing leader Matsuki, today "refused the Emperor's audience after the opening of the Second Diet." This responsibility is an unprecedented action in Japanese history. Matsumoto said that he opposed the "audience". Since the Emperor was invited to attend the opening ceremony of the Diet, the speakers of both houses should welcome the emperor. Now instead of showing respect, it is absurd.</p>

<p>[Social Success Lake, 20th] It is heard that the United Nations Palestine Partition Committee reached a general understanding on the 20th that after the British troops withdraw this summer and the United Nations implements partition, international troops will be sent to the Holy Land to maintain order.

<h3 id="e61">After the Revival of the Communist International: Where is France Going? November 12th Air Mail from Paris; Special Correspondent Mao Shu <a href="#e61" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c61" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">61</a></h3>
<p>The news of the Warsaw Nine-Nation Conference spread throughout Europe. The first country to react with the most tension was France. This was not only because the "bigwig" of the French Communist Party, Duclos, went all the way to Warsaw to attend, but it was actually a powerful factor in attacking the current French regime. After the end of World War II, France's domestic politics were a multi-party coalition. Initially, the Communist Party participated in the cabinet. Later, although the Communist Party was excluded from the cabinet, it still possessed a strong force in the French National Assembly (i.e., the original House of Representatives). In diplomacy, France was not only a bridge between the United States and the Soviet Union, but almost the "only" bridge. In the international conference hall, Molotov's arrogant demeanor seemed to show a bit of "deference" only to Bidault. Recently, former U.S. Secretary of State Byrnes's magnum opus "Speaking Frankly" has been published daily in the "Paris edition" of the Avant-Garde Tribune, and there are several passages that talk about the old events of the Yalta Conference. Stalin and Molotov's contempt for France at that time has surprised many French readers today.</p>
<p>Frankly speaking, from Hitler's surrender to the present stage, France's diplomacy should be considered the most successful. France is still suffering from inflation, and the wars in the colonies are still nowhere near the end. The restoration of industry and agriculture is not only not keeping up with Britain, but is also much worse than Belgium and the Netherlands. Looking at France's national economy and people's livelihood on the streets of Paris, it is almost pitch black. However, Bidault sits in the international conference hall, and no one dares not to believe that he is one of the five great powers. Since the end of the war, the most international conferences have been held in Paris. In any international conference, the United States and the Soviet Union have turned against each other, and most of them have ended with Bidault's compromise proposal. If we use Chinese characters to express this meaning, it can be called "fence-sitting diplomacy" or "bridge diplomacy."</p>
<p>The attitude of diplomacy more or less reflects the structure of domestic politics. I said in a communication in April of this year that since General de Gaulle left the French Presidential Palace, there has been an actual leader in the political shell of France, and this person is called Léon Blum. I also said: "In the period when liberalism and totalitarianism, capitalism and communism, have not completely broken down, but also cannot be completely integrated, Léon Blum is an inevitable product. Although there is only one Léon Blum in the world, there are countless incarnations of Léon Blum..." I have met Léon several times in Paris, and he repeatedly said that he was a "true Marxist," but he was definitely not a communist, especially not a communist related to Moscow.</p>
<p>Léon Blum is the top leader of the French Socialist Party. From his fallout with de Gaulle to the present, France has always been the world of the Socialist Party. Not only France, but the situation in the whole of Europe for the past two years has been that the Socialist Party has been making noise in the east and west. The ruling party in Britain, although nominally "Labour," is actually the most authentic Socialist Party. This summer, the various organizations of the European Socialist Party held a meeting in the capital of Belgium, which many people called "the reappearance of the ghost of the Second International," although they did not use the name of the "Second International." But in fact, for the past two years, the entire European situation, which has been using bridge politics between the two great powers of the United States and the Soviet Union, has been the masterpiece of the Second International.</p>
<p>The Warsaw Conference of the Nine Communist Parties directly attacked the so-called ghost of the Second International. The Warsaw Communist Manifesto clearly criticized Léon Blum, Attlee, Bevin, and the current French Prime Minister Ramadier, saying that they stole the good name of socialism and were "accomplices" of capitalism. Not long after the Warsaw Conference, I went from Poland to France and listened to Léon Blum's speech in the city of Angoulême. The seventy-year-old politician blushed and scolded the Communist Party. He directly analyzed the current world's two major groups, the current situation and the future. He especially criticized the French Communist Party for listening to Moscow in everything.</p>
<p>That speech was given at a medal awarding ceremony for members of the Socialist Party. Léon Blum especially emphasized the unity within the Socialist Party. He said that some party members, because they could not resist the sweet words of the Communist Party, and at the same time because their understanding of true socialism was not enough, "have recently appeared very shaken." A French colleague secretly told me: that refers to Mollet. Mollet is now the leader of the left wing of the French Socialist Party and is an opponent of Ramadier. In the left-right struggle of the Socialist Party, Ramadier formed the cabinet, while Mollet took the post of Secretary-General of the Central Committee of the Socialist Party.</p>
<p>No one told me the inside story of Mollet's cooperation with the Communist Party. Generally speaking, when the actions of the Communist Party are moving towards extremism, the Socialist Party has only two paths to take: one path is to "cooperate" with the Communist Party, even to the point of selling its soul to him. The left-wing leader of the Polish Socialist Party, the thirty-five-year-old bald young man Cyrankiewicz, is like this. During my stay in Warsaw, I saw Cyrankiewicz "fully" "cooperating" with the Communists, and at the same time I saw him using all means to "purge" the Socialist Party internally. As far as the so-called left wing of the Socialist Party is concerned, this path is not impassable, because socialism and communism are only separated by a wall. Although the old theories of the "Second International" thirty years ago still had a small effect in using the "US-Soviet bridge" in the past two years, the so-called international combination of the Socialist Party is still empty. American diplomacy under Vandenberg and Connally will not nakedly talk about socialism, but Moscow's strengthening of the use of the International Communist Party is never perfunctory in the slightest.</p>
<p>However, Mollet did not choose this path. After all, the situation in France today, and the factors of geography and history, have not yet reached the state of Poland. When I arrived in Paris, it was the eve of the general election of cities and towns, and the Communist Party's masterpiece "Labour Movement" expanded to all workers of the subway. According to Parisians, the subway strike was the first time in thirty years. When this transportation artery is cut off, no matter how beautiful Paris is, it will become like death. Prime Minister Ramadier mobilized all military vehicles and private trucks to help maintain transportation. The streets were crowded with vehicles. It took twenty or thirty minutes to wait for a taxi to cross a bridge. The army was dispatched all over the city, and the police were sweating profusely, unable to maintain that ugly traffic rule. The Communist Party was secretly laughing every day: "See how many days this Socialist cabinet can last?"</p>
<p>Those few days, the scene was indeed lively enough. De Gaulle, who made a comeback, was cheered "Long live!" by the crowds in the torrential rain in Algiers! A few days earlier, de Gaulle gave a speech at the Vincennes racetrack in Paris, scolding the Communists, cursing the spoils-system "democracy," and criticizing the current constitution of the Fourth Republic. The general idea was exactly the same as his founding declaration of the "Rally of the French People" in Strasbourg. One point was very new: in Strasbourg, he rarely talked about foreign countries, but this time in his speech at the Vincennes racetrack in Paris, he praised the United States and President Truman.</p>
<p>What interested me were the scattered materials after the speech. De Gaulle's own newspaper said that there were 700,000 listeners, while the Communist Party's "Humanité" said that there were about 50,000 listeners. The French people's lack of a sense of numbers surprised me! One army newspaper said that there were 500,000 listeners, while the police report said that there were 150,000 participants. According to the police spokesman, they calculated based on the seats in the racetrack, so it was more accurate!</p>
<p>It was at that time that Bidault returned from the United States! Paris's "Humanité" wrote in large headlines: "Bidault returns empty-handed!" On another day, the Communist Party's "Humanité" called Bidault "Truman's errand boy." What was especially humorous was that next to their report of Bidault returning empty-handed, they wrote in conspicuous large characters: "The Soviet Union's 1.5 million tons of wheat are waiting to be shipped to France!"</p>
<p>Bidault always had that "slow" and "unhurried" look. At the airport, he said: "The Marshall Aid Plan is a manifestation of the political wisdom of the United States, it is the generosity and assistance of the United States, it is the cornerstone of creating lasting peace for mankind after this war defeated the common enemy of mankind, therefore, I firmly believe that the Marshall Aid Plan will be realized!"</p>
<p>At the winter sports arena in Paris, at the campaign speech of the MRP (Popular Republican Movement), Bidault told many humorous stories that made people laugh until their stomachs hurt. He said: "The Communists say that I returned from the United States empty-handed, but may I ask, which one has returned from another country with both hands full?" He said: Today, France's right to exist has not been denied. "From the White House to Broadway Road in New York, none of the Americans I have contacted does not sympathize with and help us, France." Bidault also called on the Communist Party not to look at France with the eyes of Russians, but to look at France with the state of mind of French people. He believes that France has gained more support and will definitely be able to obtain American wheat, coal, and industrial raw materials this winter. "As for the detailed negotiations, diplomacy should be kept confidential, so please forgive me for not being able to reveal them here!" The crowd applauded him warmly.</p>
<p>The Popular Republican Movement was singing a "duet" that day. After Bidault's speech, Deputy Prime Minister dared to scold de Gaulle for a long time, saying that the Communist Party's terrorism and the "Rally of the French People's" nonsense were both enemies of the French people. He said: "De Gaulle is indeed great, therefore, in his mind, only he himself is great!" The audience burst out laughing!</p>
<p>However, the election ended, and the Popular Republican Movement (MRP) encountered an unprecedented defeat. Both the Communist Party and de Gaulle won. What do these symbolize? They symbolize dissatisfaction with the status quo and aversion to "bridge politics." The impatient French people may be thinking: the world is now divided into two groups, political systems and political forms, "if you don't belong to Yang, you belong to Mo," therefore, France must also choose a path to take!</p>
<p>Is this the general trend? The clear-headed Prime Minister Ramadier wants the people to think calmly, to think about the current French environment; is it to take a lopsided path with a great power? Or is it to maintain France's neutral position and take the middle path? The parliament voted a vote of confidence once or twice (the second time was 300 to 280 votes), the Socialist cabinet still exists, and Léon Blum's "fence-sitting philosophy," "bridge philosophy," and Britain's Laski philosophy still shine brightly on both sides of the English Channel!</p>
<p>How long can this situation be delayed? No one dares to make a reckless judgment. After the revival of the Communist International, Moscow's style will definitely be more "quick knife and bright head." Bulgaria's Petkov was sent to the gallows, Romania's Maniu entered the prison, and Poland's Mikolajczyk, who was repeatedly mentioned in my Polish communication in July, has now secretly fled to England, escaping from danger. The opposition parties in Hungary have almost all fled into exile, and Czechoslovakia is now in a turbulent situation. Europe is already intensifying the "unification movement," and the "bridges" of Western Europe are gradually losing their function. The Warsaw Declaration of the Communist International has clearly criticized Léon Blum and Ramadier, so Thorez (leader of the French Communist Party) sitting in Paris will certainly no longer seek compromise with the French Socialist Party!</p>
<p>Therefore, the "strikes" led by the French General Confederation of Labour, which is controlled by the Communist Party, will also continue to follow. The previous strike of 2,000 cleaners, storming the city government, almost caused a major bloodshed. Inflation, prices are continuing to rise, and the lack of supplies is cyclically fueling this terrifying winter!</p>
<p>Because there is no coal and the electricity is not enough, Paris is once again vigorously promoting "electricity conservation." There is no electricity in the city in the morning and no electricity in the suburbs at night. The London Mail's new headline says "Parisians Eat in the Dark." In fact, there are not many people in the city who really get up early.</p>
<p>What is still terrible is the food problem. The grain-made bread is also gradually being eaten up. The Russian wheat that the Communist Party has repeatedly declared was originally scheduled to donate 1.5 million tons to France, but now it has been reduced to only 300,000 tons, and it must be exchanged for French automobiles, textiles, and chemical fertilizers. France has an economic negotiation delegation in Moscow. The best thing is: the authorities in the Kremlin clearly told the French representative: the Soviet Union does not have too much food to supply to foreign countries, and besides, France is not a country worth supplying!</p>
<p>Is Moscow preparing to abandon this bridge, or is France itself changing? (At the Hotel Crillon in Paris)</p>

<h3 id="e62">Legislative Yuan Elections Begin Yesterday; Campaign Propaganda Reaches Climax; Citizens Vote Can Maintain Order; Mayor Wu Personally Votes for Yen Hui-ching, Director Chang Prepares to Come Last <a href="#e62" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c62" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">62</a></h3>
<p>[Reported by This Newspaper] The first Legislative Yuan election in this city began at eight o'clock yesterday morning. The morning mist was still thick, and the roads were wet. After the citizens started their factories and sounded the whistles, they went to the polling places to vote one after another. Yesterday was the first day of voting, and it was not a holiday. Civil servants and office workers could only take time to vote during lunch and after work, so it was not very enthusiastic. It is estimated that the number of votes in the regional election yesterday was probably less than 200,000.</p>
<p>Mayor Wu Kuo-chen went to the third polling place in the Changshu District (Zhaoguang Middle School) at 9:10 AM to personally vote for Yen Hui-ching, a candidate backed by the government. It is said that the mayor's wife will vote at the same location at noon on the 23rd. Speaker Pan Kung-chan went to Beijing on official business and will rush back on the 23rd. It is speculated that he will also vote for Yen Hui-ching. Hsieh Jen-chao, secretary-general of the Kuomintang city party headquarters, voted for Yen Hui-ching at Zhaoguang Middle School after the mayor. Director Chang Kai-hsien also voted for Yen Hui-ching at the polling place in the Yuyuan Road-West Road area yesterday morning, expressing his satisfaction with the good order of this election. Director Chang Hsiao-sung, the chief executive of the election affairs office, was stationed at the election affairs office, contacting various parties by telephone all day, handling various emergencies, and giving instructions on everything. Chang said that he will still follow the precedent of the National Assembly election and cast the last vote at noon on the 23rd. The five members of the family will each support different candidates to show fairness.</p>
<h3 id="e63">Military and Police Personnel Vie to Elect Wang and Fang <a href="#e63" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c63" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">63</a></h3>
<p>In this election for municipal legislators, most candidates are well-known figures with a substantial base of support, making the competition fierce. The outcome remains uncertain until the very last moment. Each candidate's ranking varies across different districts. In the Huangpu District, Wang Xinheng, Fang Zhichao, and Ma Junshuo hold a considerable advantage. Military and police personnel, in particular, almost unanimously voted for Wang and Fang. In the Changning District, as of last night's close, over 13,000 votes were cast, with Ma Shuli leading in the number of votes, followed by Yan Huiqing, Wang Xinheng, and Fang Zhichao, then Bu Wei, Cao Jun, and Xie Renzhao. In the Songshan District, due to the concentrated population, voter turnout was high yesterday, with Zhu Wende holding a notable advantage.</p>
<p>(Picture Caption) Mayor Wu retrieves his ballot at the third polling station in Changshu District (Photo by this newspaper)</p>
<p>Rooftop Broadcasting Draws Attention</p>
<p>Zhu Wende set up a temporary radio station on the rooftop of a pseudo-foreign shoe and hat shop, with a loudspeaker extending onto Tibet Road. A Miss Li broadcast in Mandarin every few minutes, her melodious voice interspersed with popular songs, attracting considerable attention from passersby. The shop is only a few steps away from the Sino-French School polling station, making Zhu's campaign promotion both unique and effective.</p>
<p>In the Luwan District, it is estimated that approximately 5,000 people voted yesterday, with Wang Xinheng and Fang Zhichao receiving the most votes. In the Hongkou District, voters chose according to their identity, with military and police supporting Fang Zhichao and Wang Xinheng, and people from northern Jiangsu province selecting Ma Shuli. Yesterday, in the Jing'an, Yangjing, Xinjing, and Penglai districts, Ma Junshuo also held a considerable advantage in votes. Overall, yesterday's voting order showed improvement compared to the National Assembly election, likely due to increased experience. The dispute at the fourth polling station in Zhabei was an unfortunate exception.</p>
<p>Several Disputes</p>
<p>At around 11 a.m. yesterday, approximately two hundred voters swarmed to the polling station, demanding ballots based on their voter registration certificates. Zhao Xingqiao, the supervisor, refused because the individuals did not have identification cards, which did not meet the requirements. A conflict ensued, and Zhao was attacked. Following instructions from the election affairs office, voting was suspended for about an hour. Order was restored and voting continued after the police dispatched officers to the scene. Supervisor Zhao Xingqiao was exchanged with the supervisor of the first polling station in the district. The attacking crowd, mistaking "Zhao" for a homophone of "Cao," believed that Supervisor Zhao was the younger brother of candidate Cao Jun and was refusing to issue ballots to favor Cao Jun, leading to the conflict. Apart from this, there were minor disputes in the Yangshupu, Tilanqiao, and North Railway Station districts, but they were not serious and were resolved quickly.</p>
<p>Campaign Activities Employ Various Strategies</p>
<p>Yesterday, the campaign activities of the various candidates reached a fever pitch. Campaign slogans and promotional vehicles were visible everywhere at "strategic points" along the roads. Among the regional candidates, Zheng Yuxiu was the most generous in spending, using banners, slogans, promotional vehicles, and even distributing promotional pamphlets along North Sichuan Road in cars, as well as scattering small cards on the road to attract pedestrians. Fang Zhichao's campaign slogans were also quite cleverly researched. Many signs were posted in front of each polling station, reading "Those who vote for Fang Zhichao go this way." Many voters believed that they could only vote for the Wan family at this location. In the Zhabei District's first polling station, Ma Shuli and Ma Junshuo's activities were also the most vigorous, providing transportation for voters in trucks, benefiting both them and themselves.</p>

<p>[Reported by This Newspaper] Student circles in this city protested the Kowloon City incident on the 17th of this month by gathering at the British Consulate and other locations on the Bund to protest and demonstrate. At that time, some students covered the consulate's gilded railing and the walls of several British companies, and even the Central Bank, with tar, writing slogans in tar. It is now known that the work to remove the tar writing is quite extensive, costly, and difficult to completely clean. According to Dalton, director of the Shanghai Chemical Laboratory, gasoline and kerosene are best for removing tar stains in general, but stone and cement absorb tar, so while the surface stains can be removed with the above-mentioned oils, traces will remain. Alternatively, caustic soda or a high-heat blowtorch can be used to heat the surface before wiping with gasoline or kerosene, but it is still impossible to completely clean it. Dalton stated that he will immediately experiment to invent a suitable cleaning agent to remove tar stains from stone and cement.</p>
<p>Professional Groups' Elections Held in Twenty-Eight Locations; Newspaper Workers' Voting Starts Today, Technicians' Procedures Not Yet Complete; Ding Jie and Lu Jingshi's Twenty-Three Vehicle Parade is Immensely Impressive</p>
<p>[Reported by This Newspaper] Elections for professional groups' legislative representatives were held enthusiastically at twenty-eight locations in the city throughout yesterday. Unlike the National Assembly elections, the list of candidates was printed on the ballot, and voters only needed to circle the name of the candidate they supported, saving them the trouble of clerical errors. In addition, voters had to present their national identification cards before voting, so order was well-maintained. Voters found the procedures simple and were already experienced with the election method, so the process went smoothly.</p>
<p>The candidates' promotional activities were in full swing, with large banners and colorful leaflets covering the streets. Among them, Lu Jingshi's parade was the most impressive. Starting at nine in the morning, the various labor unions gathered twenty-three promotional vehicles, which circled the city, adorned with colorful ribbons and flowers. Various factories took the opportunity to add advertisements to the vehicles, displaying electric fans and thermos bottles. After voting, workers from various factories in the Yangshupu area paraded in formation, singing songs in support of Lu Jingshi's campaign. According to the results of yesterday's all-day elections in the various labor union polling stations, Lu Jingshi led, followed by Ling Yingzhen (female). Some factories will close for the day today for the election, and it is expected that the number of voters will increase.</p>
<p>Professors Do Not Want People to Eavesdrop on Their Choices</p>
<p>Only professors, lecturers, and teaching assistants participated in this year's college faculty elections, so the number of participants was small. The voting situation yesterday was not enthusiastic. When marking their ballots, they did not want to be eavesdropped upon and went to a corner of the room to think carefully before hastily dropping their ballots into the ballot box. For this reason, no one could estimate which candidate in this group received more votes. Yesterday morning, Fudan University professor Zhu Sihuang went to Aurora University to vote, but the administrator verified that Fudan University should vote at the Fuxing Middle School polling station. A minor dispute ensued. Zhu insisted on exercising his right to vote as a citizen regardless of location, but the administrator believed that the ballot would be invalid if the ballot number did not match. The two sides debated politely, and in the end, Zhu followed instructions and went to Fuxing Middle School to vote.</p>
<p>Ou Yuanhuai Serves Oranges and Peanuts</p>
<p>Ou Yuanhuai, President of Great China University, set up a reception area in a small house next to the Aurora University polling station, providing oranges and peanuts to voters. Yesterday, Ou received the support of more than one hundred professors.</p>
<p>The most campaign banners are at the Great World Plaza, with dozens of red and white banners flying in the wind.</p>
<p>Ten Thousand Tons of Coal Rushed Southward, Divided Equally Between Nanjing and Shanghai</p>
<p>[Reported by This Newspaper] The Fuel Management Committee has already begun preparing for the city's coal needs in February and is confident in its ability to meet them. The committee will soon rush ten thousand tons of coal southward from the Xuzhou and Bengbu areas along the Tianjin-Pukou Railway, with five thousand tons for Shanghai and five thousand tons for Nanjing. The committee will send Yang Yunfu to the Tianjin-Pukou line to oversee the transport of coal. In addition, at least five thousand tons of coal from Taiwan will arrive in Shanghai next month, and the committee has sent Commissioner Zhou to oversee the transport. Furthermore, there will be three to five thousand tons of foreign coal transported. Therefore, the city's coal supply for February should not be a problem. Furthermore, Zhang Shanyang, Deputy Chairman of the committee, has resigned, which has been approved by the ministry. The vacancy has been filled by Shi Xiangbei, who reported to work at the committee yesterday.</p>
<p>Adding Drivers, Tearing Slogans, and Cursing</p>
<p>Among special trade unions, the Telecommunications Union provided convenience for its workers, who are scattered in various locations, by first holding voting yesterday at the Fuzhou Road receiving office and the International Radio Station, and will move to the Yokohama Bridge General Bureau and the Zhenru Radio Station today. Among the candidates, many used promotional stickers and posted them on various vehicles. However, the owners of private cars strongly dislike this and often order their drivers to wash them off completely. As a result, drivers are often seen tearing off the stickers while cursing. Dongwu University converted a school bus into a mobile broadcasting vehicle and went to the streets to have its Law School Dean Xu Zhenwei give campaign speeches.</p>
<p>Some candidates also massively distribute campaign leaflets on the streets. However, after passersby briefly glance at these leaflets, they are immediately collected by street vendors to be used for wrapping peanuts and spiced beans.</p>
<p>The Engineers' election was originally scheduled to be held in Zhongzheng Park. Yesterday, the city's Election Affairs Office suddenly received a call from Nanjing stating that the group's election procedures were not yet complete and ordering a temporary halt. When it will resume has not yet been decided. The Journalists' Association is scheduled to vote today.</p>
<p>A Newlywed Arrested</p>
<p>[Reported by This Newspaper] Chen Huiting, thirty years old and an assistant manager at the Pudong Iron Factory, was holding his wedding ceremony with Li Jingru, a teacher at the Zhoupu Elementary School, at the Youth Association on Baxianqiao at around 4 PM. Suddenly, his legal wife, Ma Damei, found out and reported it to the Songshan Police Precinct. Police officers were dispatched and, at around 6 PM after the ceremony, Chen and Li were taken to the station for investigation. According to Ma, she has been married to Chen for nearly ten years and has two children. On June 29th of last year, Chen suddenly asked her to make a handprint on a blank piece of paper under the pretense of borrowing 100 dans of rice from a friend. Ma, unaware of his plan, agreed. Chen then used it to fill out a divorce certificate and completed the divorce proceedings at a lawyer's office. Chen believed his plan had succeeded, and then proceeded to hold his wedding with Li Jingru. The police precinct deemed that Chen was not without suspicion, and therefore detained him.</p>

<p>Haikang Ship Anchored Due to Fog, Arrival Postponed to This Morning</p>
<p>[Reported by This Newspaper] The Haikang ship, carrying the first batch of Japanese reparations goods, anchored at North Saddle due to fog at sea yesterday, preventing it from arriving yesterday.

<p>Postal and Telecommunications Price Hikes Without Legislative Procedures</p>
<p>[Reported by This Newspaper] Lawyer Cheng Mengming recently filed a complaint with the local court against Li Jinlu, the Director of the Shanghai Postal Administration, requesting that the "underpayment" due to the "postal and telecommunications price hikes" be ruled invalid. The content of the complaint stated: "The postal and telecommunications price hikes concern the rights and obligations of the people. According to the regulations of the standard law, they should follow legislative procedures, otherwise they cannot be considered legal. Legal principles are not law, and laws must be passed through three readings, promulgated, and take effect on the date of arrival. Unless otherwise specified, it should not be retroactive. The State Council has the authority to formulate legislative principles, and while its expedient handling may be considered legal and effective, it cannot be considered law. Therefore, it cannot have legal effect. In past cases, the State Council has amended legal provisions through resolutions and ordered their implementation first, and while there are such precedents, given the above explanation, they are not in compliance. Now that the Constitution is in place, the old ways of doing things should not be followed again and again. The postal and telecommunications price hikes are without legal basis, and therefore the overcharged so-called "underpayment" is an unjustified enrichment." Cheng Mengming provided three points to explain his complaint: He filed a complaint with the local court on December 26th of last year. He is now refiling it because the court has not conducted a hearing on the case. This complaint is not against Li Jinlu personally, but for the benefit of the entire public. Legislative representatives express the will of the people, and the judiciary executes the will of the people. The court should not protect administrative officials and leave the case pending. According to the standard law, postal and telecommunications price hikes must be approved by the Legislative Yuan. The State Council cannot make such regulations.</p>

<p>Shanghai Customs Embezzlement Case; Yin Lansun's Wonderful Testimony; Claimed He Didn't Understand the Use of US Dollars and Declared "Never Again"</p>
<p>[Reported by This Newspaper, Nanjing, 21st] The Shanghai Customs embezzlement case is still under investigation in the Capital District Court. Yin Lansun, the former assistant director of the Shanghai Customs and one of the main perpetrators, was questioned twice on the 21st about the details of the embezzlement. Yin confessed the process of committing the crime, which was very interesting. He stated that Zhang Yuan came to visit the first time, asking him to release the goods, but he refused. Zhang came to visit the second time and said that the goods were operated by Yue Xinmin's friends, and asked him to do it out of consideration for their relationship. He relented due to the friendship. Several days after the incident, Zhang sent him US$1,500, which he did not understand. After Zhang explained, he reluctantly accepted it and declared "never again." He did not know that this behavior was corruption. He asked the court to take this into consideration.</p>

<h3 id="e64">A Scene Woven with Blood and Tears: A Tour of Several Shelters; Their Encounters are Either Bandits or Disasters; The Life of Exile Contains Infinite Suffering <a href="#e64" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c64" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">64</a></h3>
<p>[Special Report by This Newspaper] Yesterday, this reporter visited several shelters in the suburbs to speak with the refugees being housed there. A scene woven with blood and tears, deeply imprinted on my mind, emerged. This scene, on the other hand of urban extravagance and dissipation, is such an unconcordant note, indeed like the vast difference between heaven and hell.</p>
<p>In the first shelter next to the Guanshengyuan Farm in Caohejing, a young man in his twenties from northern Jiangsu province tearfully recounted his unfortunate experience. He was from Funing, Jiangsu, and his family originally ran a cigarette shop and had 54 mu of thin land, which could be called a well-off family. Later, the Communists came, and needless to say, his family was the object of "struggle." The shop was looted and sealed, the land was confiscated and divided, and his brother was killed on trumped-up charges. He risked his life to escape to Shanghai to find his cousin, but because his clothes were ragged, he was arrested by the police on the street and sent to the shelter. He said excitedly: "Those who have been stimulated by the Communists know that the Communist Party is truly hateful!"</p>
<p>There was also an old man of fifty-four with gray hair. When he spoke, tears streamed down his face, and he kept shouting, "Bitter, ah, bitter!" He was from Peixian, Jiangsu, and worked as a farmer. He had 60 mu of land, but it had been devastated by floods and there had been no harvest for three years. This time, he came to Shanghai to seek refuge with his brother-in-law, but he was also mistaken for a beggar by the police on the street and sent in.</p>

<p>The Poorer You Are, the Less You Eat</p>
<p>In the Second Shelter near Sheng Sheng Ranch and the Third Shelter on Yangshupu Jun Gong Road, there were also many women, children, and the elderly. Their experiences were almost all the same: either bandits or disasters had ruined their families, destroyed their property, and the life of exile contained infinite suffering.</p>
<p>In the shelters, they had a set of cotton clothes, a cotton quilt, and two meals of rough rice a day, which kept them warm and fed, but they could not see their fathers and sons, and brothers and wives were separated. This kind of mental pain was enough for them to endure. The Relief Administration stipulated that each refugee's ration was two dou of rice per month and 50,000 yuan for vegetables per month. Two dou of rice a month might be enough for ordinary people, but the more unfortunate these people are, the more their stomachs expand. Not to mention adults, many small refugees also held their empty bowls and said, "We can't get enough to eat!"</p>
<h3 id="e65">Several Reasons Why Refugees Flee <a href="#e65" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c65" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">65</a></h3>
<p>The First Shelter Houses</p>
<p>The First Shelter houses able-bodied refugees. Because it was established earlier, it is relatively on track. The management methods are completely militarized. In addition to food and lodging, they are also required to line up for exercises every day, and the administrators provide them with life education. The Second Shelter houses women, children, and the elderly, which makes it more difficult to manage. The Third Shelter was only recently opened, and because funds are limited and there is a lack of manpower, the order is not yet in place. Moreover, the address is combined with the reception center for unemployed workers in the rear, which makes management even more difficult. Some refugees who are unwilling to stay in the shelter flee at the opportunity.</p>
<p>Speaking of refugees fleeing from the shelters, it seems incredible at first glance. But yesterday, this reporter personally saw and heard several refugees asking to be let out. According to these people's statements, they can be roughly divided into several categories: one is that they are not refugees but were mistakenly arrested, one is that although they are refugees, their families are still wandering outside, so they would rather go out and share the hardships together. One is beggars and swindlers who were arrested. Their begging life is actually more comfortable than in the shelter, so they naturally hope to leave.</p>

<h3 id="e66">Thumbing Up and Saying "Unlucky" <a href="#e66" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c66" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">66</a></h3>
<p>In the Third Shelter on Jun Gong Road, there was a child who looked like a little swindler who, with a flick of his thumb, vividly said, "I have fish and meat to eat every day outside. It's really unlucky to be caught here!"</p>
<p>The most heartening thing is that the Social Affairs Bureau has already started working on more than a dozen work-relief shelters to concentrate the able-bodied refugees and implement work-for-relief. This method is very worthy of encouragement, because according to this reporter's observation, simply giving refugees and vagrants food and lodging is absolutely not enough. This at most allows them to maintain the life of primitive animals. More importantly, they need to be given work to make their lives like a "human."</p>
<h3 id="e67">Refugees at Two Shelters Start Ditch Dredging Work <a href="#e67" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c67" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">67</a></h3>
<p>[Reported by This Newspaper] The work-for-relief portion of the city's Winter Relief Society began yesterday. More than 500 refugees from the Third Shelter on Zhongshan Road, the Fourth Shelter in Hongqiao Town, and other shelters participated in the Puhuitang ditch dredging work starting yesterday. The ditch runs from Xujiahui, through Qibao Town and Sijing Town, directly to Qingpu and Songjiang. After completion, it will greatly benefit the transportation of rice to Shanghai from Qingpu and Songjiang. The Winter Relief Society is scheduled to invite Mayor Wu and Director Wu to inspect the site this Sunday.</p>

<p>After the police cracked the international black market gold speculation case and transferred it to the district attorney's office, the handling prosecutor carefully reviewed all the case files and determined that the police's investigation of the case was extremely accurate. It was decided that no further investigation would be conducted. The suspects, including the main offender McDonald, have been separately indicted for disrupting the financial order.

<p>[Reported by This Newspaper] Social Affairs Bureau Director Wu Kaixian said yesterday that jewelry stores in the city should reregister in accordance with the new regulations recently issued by the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Economic Affairs. They will then be issued temporary business licenses after the Social Affairs Bureau approves their registration. After completing these procedures in two weeks, the issue of opening up the buying and selling of gold ornaments and the labor problems will be addressed, and there may be a solution.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The scandalous affairs of the renowned dancing star, Foreign Girl Li Zhen, and her "happy rivals," Shen Gongwei, have continued to unfold. Yesterday at 11 PM, Shen, along with Li, were drinking heavily at a restaurant, becoming quite drunk. Afterwards, they hired a car to return to Shen's residence at the intersection of Shaanxi North Road and XinZha Road. They went directly into Shen's father's bedroom, intending to stay overnight. Shen Gongwei's wife, Mao Xiuzhen, witnessed this. Although Shen had previously threatened her with a handgun, she could no longer endure it. She secretly reported to the Jing'an Temple Police Station that her husband and Li were committing adultery. Police officers were dispatched to Shen's residence to make the arrest. At the time, Li was sound asleep, while Shen reluctantly opened the door, unable to deny the situation. He surrendered himself. The police station, considering the case as adultery, which requires a complaint from the spouse, advised Shen to reconcile with his wife. Mao Xiuzhen demanded 100 large gold bars as compensation for separation living expenses and child education and support, otherwise, there would be no room for negotiation. The case will be directly transferred to the District Prosecutor's Office for interrogation this morning by the Jing'an Temple police.</p>
<h3 id="e71">Post Office Mail Sorter: Embezzlement of Remittances Exposed After a Long Time; A Total of Two to Three Hundred Million Appropriated <a href="#e71" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c71" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">71</a></h3>
<p>[Our Report] On December 26th of last year, a person surnamed Bao remitted four million yuan from Taiwan to his mother's home at 530 Jing'an Temple Road in this city (the money had to be collected at the Shanghai Taiwan Bank). A few days later, another three million yuan was remitted. Subsequently, his mother sent a letter stating that she had not received the funds. Bao boarded a plane and returned to Shanghai, inquiring at the Taiwan Bank. He discovered that the four million yuan had already been collected by someone, while the three million yuan was still there. Bao immediately reported the situation to the Laozha Police Branch. Section Chief Jiang ordered officers Zhang Kui-dong and She Guo-zhen, along with personnel from the General Post Office, to investigate. After investigation, it was discovered that Zhang Yin-chang, a guest in room 4 of the Pacific Hotel, was suspected. Zhang was taken to the police station for questioning. Zhang confessed that the main culprit in the case was his elder brother, Zhang Jin-chang, who had conspired with accomplices.</p>
<p>Zhang Jin-chang worked as a temporary mail sorter at the Kade Road Post Office branch. Around September of last year, he secretly opened letters containing cash that were mailed from other cities to the Zhengfeng Bookstore on MeiBaiGe Road and the DaZhongHua Bookstore on Bak Road. He successively embezzled approximately thirty to forty letters without being discovered. He then conspired with ruffians Wang Gen-quan, Liu Ming-fa, Gao You-shan, Shao Chang-yao, Xia Qing-wei, Dong Zu-gen, and others to continue their illegal activities. The police station arrested the main culprit, Zhang Jin-chang, and others. According to their confession, they mainly targeted registered letters containing money orders. After forging seals and fraudulently collecting the remittances, they destroyed the letters. The following cases were recorded: Han Qi-feng Pharmacy at 1, Lane 270, Nanjing West Road, one hundred and forty million yuan remitted from Hankou to Shanghai; Zhang De-hong of Yingkang Cotton Weaving Factory at 3, Lane 70, Nanjing West Road, forty million yuan remitted from Taiwan to Shanghai; Liu Pei-jing at 8, Lane 318, Beijing West Road, five million yuan and another one hundred million yuan remitted from Zhenjiang to Shanghai; Xingren Customs Brokerage at 24, Lane 107, Huanghe Road, fifty-seven million yuan and thirteen million five hundred thousand yuan remitted from Taiwan to Shanghai twice; Shi Pin-shan of Yifeng Iron Factory at 46, Lane 353, Xinzha Road, seventy-five million yuan remitted from Hangzhou to Shanghai.

<p>[Our Report] Lao Ji Yi Salt Store on Jiangwan Xinshi Road had 85 dan of salt stolen two days ago, valued at over 80 million yuan. The store owner, Zhong Fang-fu, reported the incident to the Jiangwan Police Branch. After investigation, the branch arrested the suspect, Dai Fu-rong, yesterday at Langguan Bridge, Ximen, Chongming.

<p>[Our Report] The weather has been warm for the past two days. Yesterday, the highest temperature reached 65.7 degrees Fahrenheit, and the lowest was 42.7 degrees Fahrenheit, resembling early spring. According to Zheng Zi-zheng, director of the Shanghai Meteorological Observatory: This is due to the strong southerly winds and the northward flow of warm air from the Pacific Ocean. However, this situation will not last long. A newly formed cold front in Siberia is about to move south. The weather in this city will change within days. However, whether it will be cloudy, rainy, or snowy depends on the changes and is difficult to predict for the time being. The weather forecast for today is as follows:</p>
<p>Yellow Sea: Cloudy, clear, cold, moderate variable to northerly winds, moderate waves, morning fog. Central China: Cloudy, hazy with localized rain, moderate northerly to easterly winds, morning and evening fog.

<h3 id="e82">Field Survey of Gutian Silver Mine: Fujian Province's Great Wealth Source Eagerly Awaits Development <a href="#e82" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c82" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">82</a></h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Fuzhou, 19th Dispatch] The silver mine at the Zhulin Township silver field in Gutian County, Fujian, which had been forgotten by the world, is now once again attracting the attention of the Chinese people, especially overseas Chinese from Southeast Asia. The mining of this ore deposit began during the Xuande period of the Ming Dynasty. At that time, the national treasury's silver reserves relied on the output of this town's mines. However, due to the corruption of the court at the time, as well as the corruption and oppression of those responsible for overseeing the mining, bloody resistance was sparked among the miners, which led to the cessation of work. With the passage of time, the YinChangg silver mine, this great wealth source of Fujian Province, was forgotten by the Chinese people.</p>
<p>A reporter recently responded to an invitation from the Nanqiao Economic Construction Company and went to the site with construction engineer Chen Qifa to conduct a survey. To be able to finally see the true face of this mine that has been buried for hundreds of years is something I personally consider fortunate.</p>
<p>When we turn to the records of the History of the Ming, it is not difficult to prove that the amount of silver contained in the mines around YinChangg Town surpasses that of other provinces. In 1937, the Resources Committee of the Executive Yuan sent more than 30 engineers to conduct a survey here. According to their report, all the mines within a 20-kilometer radius of YinChangg Town produce silver. Unfortunately, the mining work could not be realized due to the outbreak of the "July 7th" Incident the following year. Years ago, the U.S. State Department also sent three engineers to conduct an on-site investigation. Their report also stated that the ore deposit could be mined to a depth of 300 meters and that the silver quality contains about 97% pure silver. The lowest estimate of the mine's output is about 400,000 tons or more. The mining work will require at least more than 400 years to complete.</p>
<p>Today, the town has a sparse population and the mines are surrounded by weeds. Talking about the past with the villagers brings forth sighs of regret and lamentation. This is because during the reign of Emperor Xuande of the Ming Dynasty, tens of thousands of laborers were conscripted to mine this ore. However, due to poor management at the time, the imperial envoy and the supervising officials were corrupt, causing public resentment. Even more unfortunately, a mine pit suddenly collapsed, and all the laborers inside were buried alive. In their extreme anger, the people lured the imperial envoy to inspect the mine pit and buried him alive to show their revenge. Emperor Xuande was furious about this and issued an order: All people within ten li of YinChangg Township would be executed. This mining project was then halted. Now, the residents here have all migrated from other places in recent years. Today, when talking about the matter of opening the mine with them, they all are terrified at the mention of "silver".</p>
<p>As for this silver mine, one of the great sources of wealth in Fujian Province, the reporter hopes that it will be developed as soon as possible. It can not only help alleviate the current national economic crisis, but also contribute to the economic prosperity of the country. We deeply hope that the government will lead overseas Chinese to invest and actively and rapidly develop this source of wealth!</p>
<h3 id="e83">Yumen Covered in Four Feet of Snow: Mining Production Continues Steadfastly <a href="#e83" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c83" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">83</a></h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Lanzhou, 17th Dispatch] Guo Ke-quan, assistant manager of the China Petroleum Corporation and manager of the Gansu-Qinghai branch, flew from Jiuquan to Lanzhou yesterday (the 18th), accompanied by Jin Kai-ying, assistant manager of the company. Mr. Jin continued to Shanghai by the same plane, while Mr. Guo stayed temporarily in Lanzhou on official business.</p>
<p>This morning, the reporter visited Mr. Guo and inquired about the purpose of this trip and the recent situation of the Yumen mine. According to him: This trip to Lanzhou is purely to negotiate with the Gansu Provincial Government for the purchase of food for the employees, as the mine has nearly 10,000 employees and requires more than 4,000 shi of food per month, which must be purchased and stored in advance.</p>
<p>The cold front hit Yumen in early November last year, and the temperature at the mine has consistently been below minus 28 degrees Celsius until today. The snow at the mine is more than four feet deep, causing some of the machinery to freeze and crack, and production has been reduced to a semi-suspended state. From the end of November, the mine mobilized more than 3,000 employees to carry out emergency repairs in the icy and snowy weather. During this difficult period, they still managed to maintain production. Before 1946, the refinery used distillation furnaces. Last year, a semi-cracking oil furnace was added. In terms of quantity, the cracking furnace produces 80% to 100% more than the distillation furnace. In terms of quality, the cracking method can increase the output from 19% obtained by distillation to 35% to 38%. After the oil pipes of the cracking furnace were frozen and cracked, only the distillation furnace is currently working, so the production has been sharply reduced. However, compared to any past winter, the output is still the largest, because in the past, after October, all the machinery was often in a state of hibernation. The area of the mine's oil fields has increased fourfold compared to two years ago, reaching 50 square kilometers. There are more than 300 oil wells, but only a dozen or so are regularly producing oil. The main product is gasoline, followed by kerosene and diesel, and paraffin wax is a by-product. The new well-drilling and oil refining equipment purchased by the mine, totaling more than 6,000 tons, are currently concentrated in Shanghai. In addition to some of the equipment that has been delivered by air for urgent use, most of it must be transported to Hankou and then transported westward via the Sichuan-Hunan Highway. Recently, there are even plans to transport it to Tianjin and then to Ningxia via the PingSui Railway. Whether the production increase plan for this year can be realized depends on whether this equipment can be delivered in time. The 4.5-ton Dodge trucks that the Materials Supply Bureau plans to sell to the company have been gradually transported to Hankou and are currently being negotiated for transportation westward.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper, Lanzhou, 16th Dispatch] Zhang Huai-ren and Yang Sheng-cai, road workers of the Lanping Section of the Seventh District Highway Engineering Administration of the Ministry of Transportation, had a dispute with a footman on the 30th of last month for hiring a donkey to carry wheat. Unexpectedly, Li Huai-jin, the township chief of Shuangqiao Township, where the road work team was located, harbored resentment because the road workers had been too conscientious in protecting the trees on the road, having prevented his large iron-wheeled vehicle from driving on the highway. He took the opportunity to instigate the footman to falsely accuse the road workers of robbery. Township Chief Li even colluded with the Pingliang Self-Defense Force and sent troops to rush into the road work team's house at 10 PM that night, arresting nine people, including road workers Zhang Huai-ren and Duan Wei-dong. They were subjected to torture, resulting in serious injuries. After the Pingliang District Court investigated, it was discovered that Zhang and Duan had been falsely accused. They were acquitted a few days ago, and the footman was punished in retaliation. After learning of this, the Seventh District Highway Workers' Union expressed strong dissatisfaction that Township Chief Li Huai-jin relied on his power to act recklessly and falsely accuse good people of theft, and that the Pingliang Self-Defense Force aided and abetted the wrongdoing without being punished according to the law. It convened a board meeting, and in addition to submitting reports to the military and political authorities for thorough investigation and prosecution, it also sent a telegram to all union members to express their support.</p>

<p>Yu Shu-huai, director of the Sichuan Construction Bank, was a business tycoon in Sichuan, residing in Gongjing Township, Zigong City. On New Year's Eve last month, a thief broke into his room at night, attempting to steal 50 million yuan in deposits from the safe. When Yu discovered him, he shouted to catch the thief, and the thief struck him on the head with a sharp weapon and fled with the money. Yu was seriously injured. His family hired Dong Bing-qi, director of the Health Department, to treat him in Zigong on the next day, with a special car for the price of one billion yuan. He eventually died of his injuries on the fifth day. The murderer was arrested in Rong County four days after the escape and escorted to the Zigong Court for trial. According to the confession, his name was Liu Hou-dun, formerly an employee of the Sichuan-Kang Inspection and Management Bureau. He had been unemployed recently and asked Yu for help, but was rejected. Feeling resentful, he did this. He also said that Yu was a newly emerging business tycoon in wartime. Due to favorable circumstances, he became wealthy and was deeply envied by his salt industry counterparts in Zigong. Therefore, they bought him to do this. After the murderer was arrested, he was escorted to the scene of the incident for on-site verification. He tried to escape on the way and was shot dead by the military police. Yu was one of the richest men in Sichuan Province. In 1942, he became famous for donating 10 million yuan in national salvation donations.

<p>[Our Newspaper's Fuzhou Dispatch on the 15th] Fujian Province is mostly mountainous, and arable land is extremely scarce. In the past, food production was insufficient to meet its own needs. Since last year, the local authorities have been requesting assistance from the "Executive Yuan" to manage the reclamation of beaches in coastal counties, raising freshwater and turning it into fields, in order to enrich the people's food supply. Since the project began, all parties have placed high hopes on it. However, since the beginning of this year, as a result of the "Executive Yuan's" funding being tight, some projects have been stranded halfway, which is a great pity. For this reason, the provincial government, through the National Water Conservancy Conference, requested a comprehensive development. However, due to the enormous funding required and the inability of the treasury to support it, it was suspended. We have recently heard that the Ministry of Water Conservancy has attached great importance to this and has telegraphed Fujian to inquire about the reclaimable area and value, intending to instruct the province to do its best to supervise local people's organizations to operate independently. Our reporter recently interviewed personnel from the Water Conservancy Bureau who had previously set out to various places to investigate the actual situation. The planning of the coastal reclamation projects in Fujian Province at the current stage and their current situation are recorded below:</p>
<p>The coastline of Fujian Province is still quite long. From Beisha [illegible] Port, Sanhe Bay, and the mouth of the Min River in the north, to the coastal counties in southern Fujian, all are</p>
<p>A seawater eroded area. During high tide, it is a vast expanse of water. During low tide, the coastal area within one or two li (Chinese mile) is all "Hai [illegible]" (that is, mudflats with extremely rich salt content). In such places, apart from the few shellfish that are produced on weekdays, little is gained. If it can be reclaimed and seawater prevented from entering, in two or three years, it can all be easily turned into fertile land. Moreover, this type of land is very rich in salt, and grains are very easy to grow. Once reclaimed, the profits will be great. In the spring of last year, the Provincial Water Conservancy Bureau organized teams to conduct surveys along the coasts of eastern and southern Fujian. At that time, it was discovered that there were reclaimable coastal areas in the seven counties of Linsen, Lianjiang, Luoyuan, Ningde, Fu'an, Xiapu, and Fuding in eastern Fujian, totaling twenty locations, with an area of ​​389,520 mu (Chinese acre). In addition, there were twenty-one locations in the nine counties and cities of Fuqing, Pingtan, [illegible]tian, Xianyou, Tong'an, Hui'an, Jinjiang, Kinmen, and Xiamen in southern Fujian, with an area of ​​198,790 mu. In total, there were sixteen counties and cities in the province, with forty-one locations, covering a total area of ​​588,310 mu. It is estimated that after all the freshwater is raised, the annual increase in food production can reach 2,718,190 dan (Chinese bushel). Later, because the</p>
<p>Project was too large</p>
<p>It was not possible to start comprehensively, so twenty-six locations with greater economic value, covering 218,340 mu of land, were selected for preliminary execution. These twenty-six locations include: Jiadeng Township in Linsen County (500 mu); [illegible]xiang Township in Lianjiang [County] (11,500 mu); Songhuoxiang Township in Luoyuan [County] (15,880 mu); Xi[illegible]tang in Ningde [County] (10,000 mu); Wanwu Township in Fu'an [County] (750 mu); Shaha Pond in Xiapu [County] (6,000 mu); Dongge District in Fuqing [County] (8,700 mu); [illegible]kou in Pingtan [County] (34,000 mu); Beigaodaishi in [illegible]tian [County] (510 mu); Huoshaogang in Pingtan [County] (10,000 mu); Doumencun in Xianyou [County] (6,000 mu); Neizhou Port in Tong'an [County] (8,600 mu); Tang[illegible] Port in Tong'an [County] (470 mu); Ma Port in Tong'an [County] (4,630 mu); Baiqi Port in Hui'an [County] (13,500 mu); Houzheng Village in Hui'an [County] (2,080 mu); Qing Shandong[illegible] in Hui'an [County] (200 mu); Wuli Bridge in Jinjiang [County] (1,150 mu); [illegible]bao in [illegible] [County] (11,700 mu); Hanjiang Township in [illegible] [County] (4,500 mu); Si[illegible]hou in An [illegible] [County] (415 mu); Ya Tou in An [illegible] [County] (465 mu); Haimen in [illegible] [County] (7,100 mu); and Taipu in Tanpu [County] (3,500 mu). Among them, more than ten places, including Xi[illegible]tang in Ningde, have been under construction for years.</p>
<p>During construction</p>
<p>Funding mostly relied on the support of the Executive Yuan, and wages were all replaced with flour, with a slightly semi-work-semi-relief meaning. Unfortunately, the good times did not last, and it stopped halfway. Over the years, Fujian Province has been short of food, and famine has become a disaster. On the other hand, the coastal areas are overpopulated and unable to go abroad to make a living, resulting in wasted labor and an increasing number of displaced people. Now, if we want a win-win solution, there is nothing better than speeding up such projects. First, we can guide the millions of vagrants to the right path of farming; second, we can lay the foundation for the province's future food supply. However, the issue of funding for this [development] is quite complicated.</p>
<p>According to the province's previous plan, for this project, in addition to the [quantity] design and other aspects being the responsibility of the province, the subsequent</p>
<p>Reclamation work</p>
<p>Must be managed by the county and city governments or local people [themselves]. Considering the county's current financial situation, the prospects are not optimistic. However, considering the benefits after the completion of the project, it is believed that there will be no shortage of people [willing to contribute] their strength. Science is, after all, a [way to] overcome [difficulties]. If these many reclamation projects can be completed, then there will be no shortage of food in the future.

<p>—Production and Industry—Application of chemical [illegible], Gansu Coal Mine——Expand Agan to supply the needs of fuel, cement, and electric light factories, and conduct trial coking for [illegible] smelting materials. The Lanzhou [illegible] trunk highway should be actively improved or rebuilt to facilitate transportation and reduce costs. [illegible] Gongji Iron Smelting Plant——Reorganize the provincial and county-owned [illegible] enterprise, and plan to relocate the plant site for mass production of pots and utensils. The supply of coke or coal coke must be resolved to avoid [damaging] the mountains and forests. Gansu Cement Company——Improve technology and equipment to standardize products and select places with abundant raw materials. Add factories and plants to meet the needs of national defense and transportation construction. (2) The following factories should be planned and established or expanded in production to meet the needs of national defense and people's livelihood in the Northwest: Lanzhou Leather Industry to supply the needs of national defense, military supplies, and daily necessities. Beet Sugar Factory——Funds should be planned, equipment purchased, and factories established to centrally produce beet sugar, and small machines should be promoted separately so that rural production areas can also operate in a decentralized manner. Hand Washing Factory——In order to ensure the purity, grading, and standardization of bulk exports of wool, a hand washing factory should be planned and established in the production and sales center to facilitate the development of markets outside the province and facilitate loading and sales. Pharmaceutical Factory——Prepare Western medicines for health and medical use, and at the same time try to refine Chinese medicines for transportation and sales outside the province. Food Factory——In areas that supply a large amount of military food, a flour mill should be established to ensure a local supply without shortages, and a large-scale oil extraction and meat curing industry should be established. Clothing Factory——Military blankets [illegible] and other cold-proof and outdoor equipment should be expanded from the provincial wool factory to meet the needs of border defense. (3) Provincial state-owned industry and mining, which are directly related to national defense, should be operated independently by the province. When necessary, the central competent authorities should be asked for assistance. Those that are less important to national defense but related to people's livelihood can absorb the investment of public and private legal persons and individuals. The province should retain more than half of the shares in the investment in the first two types of industrial and mining industries. (4) In addition to being borne by the construction project funds in the budget, the fixed investment of the provincial state-owned industrial and mining enterprises should, as much as possible, request the central government or foreign investors to lend machinery and equipment for installment payments. As for the circulating funds, various methods should be used to negotiate with national financial institutions and local banks for turnover. (5) The development of provincial state-owned industrial and mining enterprises should cooperate with each other to achieve the common goal of economic construction. The [illegible] units should form a unified research and design institution to promote the effectiveness of division of labor and cooperation.</p>
<p>Trade Gold</p>
<p>(1) The province's trade should focus on the supply of daily necessities and the export of local specialties, and develop the agency business of public and private trade. Cotton yarn, sugar, tea, and paper must be purchased in large quantities from outside the province and handled by the trading company, but private operations are also encouraged. Food and fuel should be circulated within the province as [illegible]. When necessary, exchange with neighboring provinces should be sought. Hides, furs, animal products, and herbal medicines are the top ten products of the province and should be concentrated and transported out for sale by the trading company as much as possible. The trading company should gradually expand the business of purchasing raw materials, manufactured goods, machinery, and transportation equipment and selling finished products on behalf of companies and groups outside the province. Cooperatives at all levels should strive to improve their organization and develop their business to cooperate with provincial state-owned industrial, mining, and trade institutions to form basic units for production, sales, and distribution. A transportation company should be set up to handle import and export acceptances, increase the volume of trade, and coordinate the transportation tools of public business agencies by the Highway Bureau to negotiate the improvement of military transportation control and strengthen transportation functions. (2) The Gansu Provincial Bank should enrich its capital, strengthen its branches, and create a provincial financial network to promote the local economy to meet construction needs. Communicate remittances, expand discounting and acceptance, and facilitate trade circulation. Support the development of industrial, mining, agricultural, and forestry construction enterprises. Guide county local financial institutions. Develop trust business. Connect national and commercial banks to plan and establish a long-term investment market.</p>

<h3 id="e106">On the Tongji University Student Unrest, Hang Liwu Expressed: Trust in President Xi's Handling; Hopes to Still Adopt a Moderate Attitude; Students Remained on Hunger Strike Yesterday and Have Not Resumed Classes <a href="#e106" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c106" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">106</a></h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] Tongji University students are protesting the school's repeated expulsion of students. Yesterday, they still did not resume classes and went on a one-day hunger strike, transferring the funds saved from food to the student union's expenses. Because the students did not resume classes, the school authorities announced the names of students expelled for the third time, namely Li Fa, Rong Zheng, Yin Bangyan, and Zhu Wenxiu. In addition, students Huang Renduan and 13 others were each given two major demerits and two minor demerits, and placed on probation. Students Zhang Chun and 17 others were each given two major demerits. Yesterday, the students' emotions tended to ease, and it is feared that they will not resume classes in the short term.</p>
<p>Tongji University President Ding Wenyuan issued a "Notice to Students" yesterday. The full text is as follows: "Recently, a small number of students in our school have engaged in transgressive actions. In order to maintain law and order and rectify the academic atmosphere, the school authorities have taken appropriate measures, taking into account the principles of caring for students and giving lenient treatment, in order to maintain law and order and rectify the academic atmosphere, and have repeatedly advised them. In addition to publishing announcements for everyone to know, we have also issued notices to students twice, explaining in detail the school's position and the course of events. We originally hoped that all students would understand the school authorities' position and painstaking efforts, encourage each other, restore order, and concentrate on their studies, so that the school would be peaceful and tranquil. Unexpectedly, as of today, the order on campus has still not been restored. Although there are law-abiding students who are eager to attend classes, they are also coerced and unable to do so, and various manifestations have intensified, and they are threatened by a long-term strike. Such behavior is truly heartbreaking. It must be known that our school is a national university, and students are cultivated by the state. Should they abide by the laws and regulations promulgated by the government? Can they distort the facts and oppose the fair measures taken by the school authorities in implementing the rules promulgated by the Ministry? This is self-evident. This is one. Students use the name of petition to carry out coercion. On the 15th of this month, they surrounded me in the director's office, forced the director of training to sign, cursed and hit, and various other behaviors. Is this the attitude that students should have towards their teachers? If there is no other role in deliberately disrupting, why be so arrogant? This is two. The school selectively punishes to maintain discipline. On the 13th, two students were expelled, both of whom had major demerits and had repeatedly failed to repent. On the 17th, five students were expelled, three of whom were also students who had previously violated school rules and were placed on probation. On the 19th, four students were expelled, two of whom had also been placed on probation. Moreover, the punishment case on the 19th was decided by the Provisional Administrative Council, but because the class leader of the highest grade came to see us and was willing to find a way to persuade us to resume classes on the 20th, we specially reserved it for one day. Unexpectedly, on the 20th, the strike continued, and there were some elements with other intentions who deliberately obstructed other students who were willing to attend classes. There was no intention to repent or change, so we had to announce it on the 21st. It is extremely obvious that the school authorities have done their best to be lenient and unwilling to implicate others. This is three. For this reason, I will not hesitate to give earnest advice again, and I hope that all my students will take into account the reputation of the school and their own studies, consider this incident in a calm manner, do not be used, and do not be afraid of threats. Restore order immediately and go to classes as usual. Otherwise, if the situation expands and serious consequences occur, even if the students do not follow, it will be difficult to shirk responsibility. Be careful not to neglect!"</p>
<p>[Also reported] Deputy Minister Hang Liwu of the Ministry of Education responded to questions from our newspaper reporter yesterday, stating: Regarding the student unrest caused by the re-election of the student union at Tongji University, the Ministry of Education trusts President Ding Wenyuan's handling completely, but hopes that Ding will still adopt a moderate attitude to guide the young people onto the right track. The students' request to amend the student union's constitution will not be considered.</p>

Technical talents could not be coordinated. The Chinese delegation proposed to abolish the working groups and restore the subcommittee system. The conference time should be limited to three weeks. Currently, all parties are extremely interested in the WCOTP organization. This year's conference will be held in China, and the 1951 conference will be held in the United Kingdom to make the conference's influence spread more widely throughout the world. China has decided to establish Christian experimental zones in Sichuan and Wuxi. The Ministry of Education has also drafted a five-year plan for Christian education.

<p>[Xinhua News Agency Peiping Telegram] National universities in Peiping and Tientsin are currently fully cooperating to carry out the following five campaigns: 1. Telegram to the Ministry of Education requesting that, starting from January, the regular expenses of national universities be increased by at least three times the adjusted amount in December of last year. 2. Starting from January of this year, salaries will be paid based on the cost of living index. The Ministry of Education is requested to allocate funds as soon as possible so that universities can pay salaries according to the new regulations. If these funds cannot be allocated immediately, permission is requested to use the existing cost of living subsidies from January to June in the national treasury to pay salaries for January and February. 3. It is reported that the Executive Yuan has stipulated that all civil and military agencies should streamline their organizations and dismiss redundant staff. It is not yet known whether the education sector is included. The Ministry of Education is requested to clarify that educational and cultural institutions cannot be compared with general administrative departments. Educational and cultural institutions hire teachers, staff, or researchers based on their needs, and the employment of professors has a fixed term and cannot be terminated at any time. It is hoped that this regulation of the government will not include the education sector. 4. It is reported that special subsidies for teachers and staff in schools above the vocational level will also be cancelled starting from January. The academic research subsidies and special office expenses provided by the government are originally very small. The Ministry of Education is requested not to cancel them and to make reasonable adjustments. 5. In the past, the food expenses for students on public funds in various limited schools were one-seventh of the basic amount (i.e., more than 140,000 out of 990,000). There is no clear regulation on the provision of food expenses for students on public funds in the current adjustment method. If calculated based on a base number of 30 yuan times 115,000, each student would require more than 500,000 yuan. Universities have no such public funds to advance. The Ministry of Education is requested to promptly formulate regulations on the provision of food expenses to provide guidance.</p>

<p>[Our Correspondent in Batavia] The overseas Chinese in Java, who have returned to the country to participate in the World Games football preliminary selection competition, have already played three consecutive days on the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th of this month at the Sentosa Stadium in Batavia. In the first match, the Javanese Chinese United Team won 3-2. In the second match, they beat the Batavia League A team 6-1. In the third match, they beat the Batavia League B team 3-1. From these three matches, it can be seen that the Javanese Chinese football team is very strong and will undoubtedly compete with any strong team in Hong Kong, Shanghai, or Malaya in the future. The key players of the entire team are central defender Chen Binghua and left central defender Luo Tianxiu, who are currently the top players in our country and may be selected for the World Games team. The following sixteen players have been selected as representatives. The team is scheduled to depart for Hong Kong in late this month. The team lineup is as follows:</p>

<p>The committee will continue to hold the ball championship, which is divided into six types of competitions: men's senior singles, junior singles, doubles, women's singles, doubles, and mixed doubles.

<p>The list of results of each badminton league group is as follows: (as of this Monday)</p>
<h3 id="e125">Tonight's Basketball League: Chen You vs. U.S. Air Force, Shantou Team vs. Topeka <a href="#e125" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c125" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">125</a></h3>
<p>The third basketball league will have three matches starting at 5:30 PM today, still held at the gymnasium of the Municipal Gymnasium. Tickets are 20,000 yuan upstairs and 40,000 yuan downstairs. Reserved seats inside the venue are temporarily suspended. The first match is Jianle vs. Chenbai, the second is Chen You vs. U.S. Air Force, and the last is Shantou Team vs. Topeka.</p>
<p>In the Group A2, Section A match between Jianle and Chenbai, the former is experienced and has considerable strength with the participation of Zhou Jun, Chen Yong'an, Chen Chuliang, Jin Kun, Wang Lido, and others. After the expansion of Chenbai, it has gained Ni Zhiqi, Yang Xiehe, Yuan Peiyuan, and others from Jiaotong University, greatly increasing its strength. A fierce battle is inevitable when competing with Jianle.</p>
<p>In the Group A1 match between Chen You and the U.S. Air Force, although Chen You lost both matches against Encas and Hualian by a one-point margin, its strength has been fully demonstrated. Especially in the match against Dagong last week, it defeated Dagong by half a goal, shocking the basketball world. The U.S. Air Force has balanced strength, but lacks coordination. It will undoubtedly lose when it meets Chen You today.</p>
<p>In the third match, a main battle in Group A1, the Shantou Team meets Topeka. The Shantou Team was originally a leading strong team, but after Cai Yanxiong left the team and Lin Wei returned to his hometown, its strength has been greatly reduced. It must work hard when facing a strong enemy tonight. The schedule is as follows:</p>
<p>Today's Schedule</p>
<p>Jianle - Chenbai (A2A) 5:30 PM</p>
<p>Chen You - U.S. Air Force (A1) 6:30 PM</p>
<p>Shantou Team - Topeka (A1) 7:30 PM</p>
<p>(Shantou Team) Lin Zuoshi (Team Leader), He Lide, Ma Canxi, Chen Qingjiang, Ji Nankang, Lin Ziren, Zheng Guitao, Zhou Bin.</p>

<p>Regarding the football match schedule for this past, the Football Committee announced yesterday that the Group A league match between Railway and Jewish originally scheduled for this Saturday has been postponed because the Railway team sent a letter stating that most of its players were injured and unable to compete on that day. After receiving the two, the Football Committee Secretariat officially announced that the Group A match this Saturday has been postponed.</p>

<p>The Industry Ping Pong League, the schedule for each venue in the North District, is proceeding smoothly because the ballrooms in the Post Office and Post Office Five are held every night. The strong team in this district, Post Office A, is invincible and has won all seven matches. The only shortcoming is that one or two team members are often absent from each match.

<p>Mr. Zhang Jia, Governor of the Central Bank, returned to Shanghai from Peiping yesterday and went to the bank to work. According to relevant sources: Regarding the restoration of industrial loans, the Joint Treasury is collecting opinions from all parties and studying loan methods. No concrete decision has been made as of late. The authorities attach great importance to the economic difficulties in North China. The Joint Treasury will decide on the various demands put forward by the North China Petition Group, including the restoration of industrial loans. As for the barter trade between the North and South, it should be handled immediately. The only problem is the difficulty of transportation. Regarding Bei Zuyi's telegram requesting the collection of data, it is reported that a batch of economic conditions are being collected. Regarding the issue of relief supplies, the government is coordinating the matter to make a reasonable distribution according to the needs of various regions throughout the country.</p>

It then rose slightly to 708 yuan and 718 yuan. The off-market interest rate opened at 3.3 and 3.75 corners, and retreated to 699 yuan and 705 yuan due to selling. The off-market asking price was still high, once rising to 710 yuan and 720 yuan. There were many sellers for forward delivery and closing immediate delivery, so it fell to a low price of 688 yuan and 696 yuan. Fuyi was suspended from trading due to falling to the limit. Yongsheng Yarn closed at 693 yuan and 700 yuan in the afternoon, compared to the previous close. Immediate delivery stock Xinyi fell to the limit. Qinxing, Zhongfang, Tongyi, Commerce, and Huafeng each fell by 10%. Rongfeng, Datong, and Yonggong fell slightly, and the rest fell by 5%. Forward delivery stocks Meiya and Hua fell by 10%, and the rest fell by 5%.</p>
<p>Only immediate delivery was done in the afternoon. Yongsheng initially entered at 705 yuan, but was sold to 693 yuan in general. The National Bank had limited access, and then entered at over 700 yuan. Trading was very scarce, and then fell to 692 yuan. The money situation gradually eased, and then rose to 702 yuan.

<h3 id="e131">Unified Bonds Decline, Foreign Stocks Mediocre <a href="#e131" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c131" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">131</a></h3>
<p>Government bonds were even more depressed yesterday. Unified C opened at 80,000 yuan in the morning, and retreated from 81,000 yuan to close at 72,000 yuan. As a result, compared to the previous close, A and B were down 4,000 yuan, C and E were down 6,000 yuan, and Type D was also down by a small 5,000 yuan. The turnover was 4 million.</p>
<p>Foreign stocks were mediocre and changed little yesterday. Each stock fluctuated very slightly. Hong Kong Electric also stopped at 3.35 yuan. Yisha opened at 530,000 in the morning, and the high price did not exceed 550,000, and then it was slightly flat. Securities brokers bought, while Guang brokers and foreign firms sold.

<h3 id="e132">Four Banks and Two Bureaus Adjust Internal Exchange Rates <a href="#e132" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c132" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">132</a></h3>
<p>The exchange rates of the Four Banks and Two Bureaus in various regions will be adjusted from today as follows: Guangzhou 120 yuan (originally 130), Wuhan 70 yuan (originally 80 yuan), Yutao 2 yuan (originally 10 yuan), Nanchang 40 yuan (originally 35 yuan), Jingdezhen 50 yuan (originally 40 yuan), Jiujiang 40 yuan (originally 35 yuan), Ningbo and Shaoxing 5 yuan each (originally 8 yuan), Haimen 30 yuan (originally 35 yuan), Linhai 30 yuan (originally 35 yuan), Chongqing 8 yuan (originally 2 yuan), Chengdu 8 yuan (originally 2 yuan), Henan District 70 yuan (originally 60 yuan).</p>
<p>Regarding the restriction of internal exchange to prevent hot money from concentrating in Shanghai and stimulating prices, the restriction method is still being discussed by the Ministry of Finance. It is reported that national banks and bureaus have now begun to individually implement restrictions on internal exchange. All remittances to Shanghai from various regions are strictly reviewed individually, while there are no restrictions on remittances from Shanghai.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the industrial and commercial sectors feel that the national banks and bureaus' individual implementation of restrictions on internal exchange is quite difficult, because some legitimate merchants sometimes rely on remittances from the mainland to use as working capital. In the absence of restrictions, their legitimate remittances will inevitably be unable to meet the needs of smooth exchange. Therefore, the industrial and commercial sectors hope that national banks and bureaus can provide a flexible method for the remittances of normal merchants when restricting internal exchange, so that the funds of legitimate merchants will not be unable to circulate.</p>
<h3 id="e133">Deposit and Loan Interest Rates Increased Money Situation Slightly Eases in the Afternoon <a href="#e133" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c133" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">133</a></h3>

<p>[Our Correspondent in Nanking, 21st] In order to reorganize financial institutions, the Ministry of Finance has recently issued an order to all silver and money shops throughout the country to change their names and adjust their organizations. The first step is to rename all existing silver shop organizations as money shops, and those currently called silver companies will be renamed banks. The second step will be to adjust the legal organizations of money shops and banks so that the money shops and banks after the renaming can comply with the law, and personnel will be sent to conduct random inspections at appropriate times.</p>

<p>Yesterday, a total of more than 13,500 shi of grain arrived in the North and South markets, and a large number of Wuhu indica rice arrived in Shanghai, totaling more than 8,000 packages.

There was a steady stream of clear oil arrivals from all over, and sales were the slowest. Very little business was done. Wheat was flat.</p>

<p>[Our Correspondent in Wuxi, 21st] Rice and rice did not escape the weak state, but the money situation slightly eased. Households were all waiting and watching, and fluctuations were extremely small. The market opened at 1,242,000 yuan for white japonica, 1,240,000 yuan for Baiyangjian, and 1,324,000 yuan for Baiyuan, with a difference of slightly more than 10,000 yuan.

<p>According to statistics, Fuzhou's import and export trade for December of last year totaled 125,138,788,000 yuan in exports and 113,088,133,000 yuan in imports, with a trade surplus of 11,050,644,000 yuan.

<h3 id="e138">China-India Trade Not Yet Prosperous <a href="#e138" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c138" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">138</a></h3>
<p>Yu Qingbo, Chairman of the India-China General Chamber of Commerce, returned to China from India a few days ago and said that the total number of overseas Chinese in India is about 20,000, with more than 10,000 in Calcutta alone. The overseas Chinese in Calcutta mostly manufacture leather and woodenware, but the largest overseas Chinese merchants are mostly in Kalimpong on the border between Tibet and India, with more than 10 million yuan of capital, specializing in transporting tea from India to Tibet and wool from Tibet to India for sale in Europe. Trade from India has not yet become developed after the war. Before the war, the cost of camphor transported from Japan to India was higher than that of camphor transported from the United States to India, so Indians mostly switched to buying American goods. In addition to cotton, India's exports to our country include steel wire, but steel wire is prohibited from being exported by India, and gunny sacks are difficult to export due to high freight costs. Therefore, trade from India is not prosperous.</p>

<p>China Farmers Bank was ordered to hold the first auction of export tea pledged goods that expired and were not redeemed this year. The bidding was opened at 3:00 PM on the 21st at the bank. In addition to representatives from the Joint Treasury and its branches attending the auction, representatives from the Tea Export Association were also invited to participate. The event did not end until around 6:00 PM. It was publicly revealed that a total of 1,193.62 city dan, equivalent to 1,991 boxes, were auctioned, including 1,7109 boxes of Ping Lv, 151 boxes of Qihong, and 131 boxes of Ninghong, divided into 33 types, totaling 25,977,911,700 yuan. Due to the recent weak bottom, the prices were all about 30% higher than the bottom price. A total of eleven bidders won the bid, namely Jardine Matheson, Huaan, Tong Taixiang, Xinhua, Wuchang, Shanghai Tea Company, etc. It is reported that the bank still has 1,390 boxes that were not auctioned, equivalent to 985.48 city dan, totaling 13 types, totaling approximately 2,470,983,700 yuan.</p>

<p>The rising tide of the tea market has not yet subsided. After domestic production tended to shrink, the holders of goods all believed that the goods in their hands were a rare commodity, and their willingness to sell did not relax slightly. However, the export of tea was still in a firm and quiet situation because the purchasing enthusiasm of exporters repeatedly hesitated. Domestic sales of colored varieties, both the street and the customer gang, had an end to inquire, and the vortex process was still active, and the market developed extremely quickly. Looking at this situation, there may be a continued upward trend in the future.</p>

<p>The National Cotton Yarn and Cloth Management Committee, in view of the recent decline in commodity prices and the less vigorous trading in the yarn and cloth market than before, has decided to slightly reduce the negotiated price of jointly allocated yarn based on market conditions. Yesterday, China Textile's listed price for jointly allocated yarn was reduced to 33 million yuan for 20-count yarn, a reduction of 7.5 million yuan compared to the negotiated price on Monday of this week. Furthermore, China Textile's allocation quota for outport yarn for this month began its application process yesterday.</p>
<p>[Our Dispatch] Yesterday, China Textile Construction Company sold yarn as usual, totaling 368 pieces, including 79 pieces from Baoxian and 17 pieces from Jiangdu, totaling 515 pieces of 20-count yarn, with 87 purchase orders. The selling price remained unchanged.</p>
<p>Yarn Prices Fall Again: Yesterday's cotton yarn market conditions at the opening were sluggish, with industry players taking a wait-and-see approach due to the approaching Lunar New Year, and customer groups were also inactive. Furthermore, with the opening of yarn sales by China Textile Construction Company and the reduction in negotiated prices, market sentiment was weak, and sales were plentiful, causing the market to fluctuate downstream. However, towards the close, powerful players absorbed some at lower prices, and the market slightly rebounded. 42-count Blue Phoenix fine yarn fell another 1 million yuan compared to the previous day, while other coarse and fine yarns also decreased by around 500,000 to 1 million yuan.</p>
<p>Cotton Cloth Called Lower: Yesterday morning, the cotton cloth market opened with continued tightening of credit, and dealers were selling a lot, but actual sales were sluggish, and new purchases were inactive. The market was mainly dominated by clearing transactions among industry players. Guangbang was heavily selling twill, and scattered households and storefronts were cutting prices on fine cloth. As a result, the final 12-pound Longtou and other fine counts consistently fell by 2 to 4 million yuan. In addition, twill, straight tribute bleached cloth, and fine twill also decreased by 3 to 5 million yuan. However, dyed cloth and shirting remained stable. Yesterday's market in Renzhao County was due to the payment for allocated goods today, and manufacturers continued to experience sluggish silk sales and a lack of profit, leading to a sharp decline at the opening. 120-count Xu-character bright yarn initially opened at 88 million yuan, then traded at 7.5 million yuan, with the lowest point dropping to 6 million yuan in between, before recovering to 7 million yuan at noon. In the afternoon, there were transactions at 7.2 million yuan, resulting in a decrease of 5 million yuan compared to the previous day.</p>
<p>Factory Yarn: Yesterday's market also saw no actual sales, and all levels of prices declined, approximately 3 to 4 million yuan lower than the previous day. High-count zero-lot immediate bills traded at 91 million yuan with one or two transactions. The sales of Qianjing yarn were also stagnant, and quoted prices also fell by 1 to 2 million yuan.</p>
<p>Silk Goods: Yesterday's market saw Huaqiang Zhensi quilt covers decline by 4%, with one transaction at 1.3 million yuan at the opening. Subsequently, due to tight credit among industry players, many became nervous and cut prices, resulting in a straight downward trend. The closing price for immediate delivery was 39.8 million yuan, and for deferred delivery, it was 40.2 million yuan. Other silk goods also softened due to lower raw material costs and scarce actual sales.</p>

Subsequently, it was reported that Yizhong Company was distributing Nanwei Three Cannon Towers and Qiantang higher-grade cigarettes, and Dahua Tobacco Company was also distributing "Paul Kang" cigarettes, 10 packs per household, with an allocation price of 46,000 yuan per pack. Industry players' positions became tight again, and many sellers were selling heavily, causing the market to collapse. In the afternoon, there was also news that Huacheng Company would be distributing Meili cigarettes, and the market was full of selling pressure, with quoted prices showing further decline. The final 10 packs of British Old Knife and Liangpai cigarettes continued to fall by 350,000 to 400,000 yuan compared to the previous day, while other Chinese and foreign cigarettes also uniformly declined, ranging from 500 yuan to 56,000 yuan.</p>

<h3 id="e146">International Trade Practice <a href="#e146" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c146" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">146</a></h3>
<p>— Xing Guangyi</p>
<p>By An Zhijie, published by The Commercial Press</p>
<p>Before the war, China's trade was bound by unequal treaties, putting it at a disadvantage. Most of it was controlled by foreign merchants, and import and export trade was mostly handled by foreign firms. Until the Anti-Japanese War, the government adopted a controlled trade policy to meet wartime needs, but because the import and export of goods in the occupied areas could not be controlled, and international routes were limited, it was difficult to develop freely. After the victory, China's import and export trade greatly expanded, and domestic import and export firms sprung up like mushrooms. International trade is a complex business, and there are various technical issues in buying and selling transactions that need to be deeply studied. There are already many books on international trade theory on the market, but there are few books that focus specifically on international trade practice, and even fewer that are practical. The author of this book, based on his practical business experience, provides a systematic description of international trade practice. Although this book focuses on trade techniques, it makes many contributions to the theoreticalization of international trade practice. It can not only be used as a suitable textbook for university business schools related to international trade, but also a good reading material for those engaged in international trade.</p>
<p>The book consists of five parts and nineteen chapters, in two volumes, totaling 497 pages. In the general introduction, the author first explains the various difficulties and complexities of international trade. The so-called complexity and difficulty are technical issues. One must have proficient international trade techniques to overcome difficulties and protect against possible dangers in trade. The author especially emphasizes that the creed of international trade survival is "mutual benefit first," avoiding tricks and honoring promises.</p>
<p>Part One, on Sales and Purchases, elaborates on the terms, methods, prices, and preparations of sales and purchases in four chapters. Regarding the currency system for prices, the author believes that after the war, China has jumped to become one of the four powers, and all trade should adopt an autonomous policy. The first thing is to insist that import trade be priced in China's national currency. This view is reasonable, but under the current circumstances, it may not be possible to achieve it in a short time.</p>
<p>The basic method of selling and buying is "offer." The so-called "offer" is "one of the parties to a transaction proposes certain sales and purchase terms to the other party, indicating a willingness to sign a legally effective sales and purchase contract in accordance with the law." When engaging in exports, it is even more common to adopt the means of "borrowed offer," that is, if one has no goods in hand, after receiving an "offer" from a foreign buyer, one does not want to purchase the goods in advance, and does not want to lose the transaction opportunity, so one consults with domestic suppliers to ask for a borrowed offer, also limiting the acceptance period. After borrowing it, one sends a telegram to the foreign buyer. If the transaction is concluded, the goods are purchased from the domestic supplier at the original borrowed offer price. This method was commonly used by foreign firms residing in China before the war, and most domestic exporters in China did not understand international trade management, and allowed foreign firms to exploit them at will.</p>
<p>Part Two, on Documents, mainly discusses the types, nature, functions, forms, production, acquisition, and acquisition procedures of documents. The commonly used symbols and texts on various documents are explained at any time to explain their principles. The types of documents include sales contracts, purchase orders, letters of credit, bills of exchange, bills of lading, warehouse receipts, various insurance policies, various invoices, and pattern code lists, etc. In addition to explaining the opening and production procedures, detailed examples are given for reference and adoption, which is quite practical.</p>
<p>Part Three, on Cargo Transportation, first explains the packaging method and mark form and the procedures for determining ship positions, and then elaborates on the procedures for loading ships and customs declaration, and includes various application documents such as export declaration forms, foreign goods import declaration forms, inspection certificates, foreign exchange purchase certificates, and loading manifests.</p>
<p>Part Four, on Finance, mainly discusses foreign exchange issues, explaining that export foreign exchange is sold by export merchants and purchased by the government or banking industry in national currency, while import foreign exchange is purchased by import merchants and received by the government or banking industry, which sells it in national currency. All foreign exchange conversions are a kind of buying and selling, and import and export merchants must sign buying and selling contracts with the government or banks to comply with the procedures. The author lists the methods of buying and selling contracts and explains the principles of the content of the contracts. Secondly, the method of export trade capital turnover is described, that is, by means of mortgage and packing loans, attempts are made to use bank funds to turn over. This is the bank's own business, but operators must be familiar with the various procedures involved. The author details the processing procedures of various procedures and the various forms of application for reference.</p>
<p>Part Five, on Claims, first states that if there is a shortage or damage in quantity, the responsibility should be carefully investigated and compensation should be claimed from the transport company and the insurance company. If the quality is inferior and changes, the circumstances should be considered and compensation should be claimed from the seller. The author has clear solutions based on various different situations.</p>
<p>The above is an overview of this book. Here, I will further comment on my impressions:</p>
<p>Overall, the book is clearly organized, with the wonders of integration and echoing back and forth, and without the disadvantages of repetition and contradiction. It is clear and simple, allowing readers to progress step by step and easily understand. This is its strength.</p>
<p>This book focuses on trade techniques. The application document formats are widely and richly collected. The terminology and symbols used in technology are explained in detail, and examples are given. If the meaning is not complete, additional notes are added at the end of each section to supplement it, and the details are not tired of. It is necessary to make readers thoroughly understand. Because to engage in international trade, one must be proficient in foreign languages, especially English as the basis. Whether it is the principles or techniques of practice, this book tries its best to annotate in English, which contributes a lot to the application of readers. An English index is attached at the end of the book, which is especially convenient to find information according to the map.</p>
<p>To engage in import and export trade, one must be familiar with the techniques involved to avoid suffering losses. The gains and losses in between affect the profit and loss of a transaction. The author has many places in this book that provide very detailed hints on the technical aspects, which readers can easily study and understand, and is worthy of cherishing.</p>
<h3 id="e147">History of the French Revolution <a href="#e147" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c147" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">147</a></h3>
<p>— Qing</p>
<p>By Albert Mathiez, translated by Yang Renpan, published by The Commercial Press</p>
<p>The introduction of Western historiography to China has a history of nearly thirty years, but the translation of famous works of Western historiography into Chinese is few and far between, especially national history and specialized history. What I am going to introduce here is a famous work and a famous translation that has been completed after the author's lifelong research and the translator's several years of translation and annotation. It can not only be used as a reference for friends who study history, but also has a profound influence on the social life of our time. It is indeed a book that deserves special introduction.</p>
<p>When we mention Western democracy or the Western way of life, we often trace the background of its institutions and spirit to the French Revolution at the end of the eighteenth century. Indeed, human political and social life has historical origins. To explore all the psychological, institutional, and even material factors that constitute modern Western life, one must often trace back to the long past in order to discover its origins and development. This kind of echoing is very helpful to our research and understanding, and has become an indispensable and important step. European political, social, and historical scholars all pay special attention to the French Revolution, because the French Revolution has a great external and internal influence on Western democracy and the Western way of life. For more than a hundred years, the study of the French Revolution has achieved brilliant results, and these studies are accompanied by the organization and analysis of extensive and precise historical materials. Especially in recent decades, due to the opening of sealed historical materials, the expansion of the scope of historical materials, the discovery, organization, and analysis of new materials, and the great progress in technology and methods, the progress of Western scholars in the study of the French Revolution can be imagined, especially French scholars. Their spirit and methods are worthy of our attention.</p>
<p>Albert Mathiez was an outstanding historian of modern France. He devoted his life's energy and time to specialize in the history of the French Revolution. He is indeed a good model for modern scholars to study. His research on the French Revolution can be said to have reached the peak of Western scholars' research on the French Revolution to date. No one in the world is more correct than him. He did not follow any philosophy of history, and the only focus of his research spirit and attitude was to seek truth. He paid close attention to the economic life of that era, but he was not an expert in economic history. His focus was still on parliament and political parties. He also paid attention to the personal factors in history, which is completely different from the materialist view of history that completely obliterates personal factors. He only emphasized the role of economic factors. On this point, he and his teacher, Olar, the authoritative scholar of the history of the French Revolution at that time, had decades of debate. His view of the French Revolution is</p>
<p>His view of the French Revolution is comprehensive. Although he emphasizes economic factors, he does not dismiss the role of accidental events. What is especially valuable is his use of materials. He used as much original material as possible, such as newspapers, magazines, and pamphlets of the time, local government and Parisian government archives, personal diaries, letters, and memoirs. Under his careful and detailed analysis, these original materials have become useful and valuable historical materials, and constitute the flesh and blood of his papers and works. His initial research was limited to the question of education during the revolutionary era, but later his research expanded to all aspects of the revolution, especially parliament and political parties. And he has conducted thorough research on each stage of the revolution. His lifelong works are almost all specialized research papers, and these three volumes of "History of the French Revolution" are the only comprehensive works he has organized and written with the results of his lifelong research, and are the crystallization of his lifelong research. They have their own consistent attitudes and methods, which are naturally significantly different from general comprehensive works written by others.</p>
<p>Although the writing of this book is refined and careful, it does not lose its vividness. Because the author believes that academic research and historical works are different. The task of historical works is to "reconstruct" and "express" the "history itself." Academic research is analytical, while historical works are comprehensive. The "History of the French Revolution" is the author's comprehensive work. The author attempts to "insert a painting of the French Revolution with various forms, and try to be correct, clear, and vivid as much as possible." (See the author's original preface). Various complex social factors are arranged in an orderly manner in this book, showing a high level of organizational achievement. The original preface also states: "This book is based on a large number of documents, some of which are unpublished documents, and is interpreted with an independent critical spirit." From this, we can see the author's spirit, learning, and techniques. And because the writing is vivid, although it is a specialized work, it does not feel obscure. As for the years included in this book, it is from the Estates-General to the New November Coup. This starting point aroused much criticism at the time, but later it was agreed by most scholars as reasonable. The author has another monograph connected to this book on the period from after the New November Coup to the Directorate.</p>
<p>In addition to the original work, the Chinese translation of this book is also worthy of special introduction. The translator is one of the few scholars of modern Western history in China, and is also an expert in the history of the French Revolution. In his early years, the translator specialized in the history of the French Revolution under J.M. Thompson at Oxford, and wrote a paper "Saint-Just" under Thompson's guidance (already published in Chinese by The Commercial Press). Thompson is a famous scholar of the Mathiez school. Therefore, the translator's research on the history of the French Revolution has its own lineage of the Mathiez school. The translator has his own unique understanding and appreciation of Mathiez's spirit and methods of scholarship. During the eight-year Anti-Japanese War, the translator's main work in the rear, in addition to lecturing on the history of the French Revolution at the university, was the translation of this book. During the translation, in order to be detailed and precise, he also referred to the English translation and corrected some errors and omissions in the English translation, so this translation is more faithful and complete than the English translation. As for the translation names, he also referred to various specialized books and set five principles (see the translator's preface), which shows the translator's careful attitude and precise methods. As for the translation style, it is a direct translation that shows the meaning of the words, which is faithful and clear. And the writing style can closely match the original work. Although it is a direct translation, it does not feel awkward.</p>
<p>In addition, there are two points about the Chinese translation that are worth special introduction, namely the annotations and the appendix. The original work was written for general readers and omits annotations. But Chinese readers, especially Chinese readers who do not specialize in French history, will definitely feel difficult. The translator referred to various specialized books and made detailed annotations. In order to facilitate readers' reference, the translator also added five appendices. Among them, "Chronicle of Major Events of the French Revolution," "Table of Depreciation of the Mandate Tickets," and "Comparison Table of the Revolutionary Calendar in the Second Year of the Republic" can be used for inspection and comparison. "Overview of the Research on the History of the French Revolution" and "Mathiez and the Research on the History of the French Revolution" are written by the translator and can help readers understand the process and achievements of the research on the history of the French Revolution and the attitude and methods of the original author. The value of these five appendices can be imagined.</p>
<p>In the year of the inauguration of the constitution, an understanding of Western democracy is urgently needed, and this book meets this need. We are willing to sincerely introduce this work and this translation.</p>
<h3 id="e148">Reading "Yong Yuan Ci Chao" (Collection of Ci Poetry from Yong Yuan Garden) <a href="#e148" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c148" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">148</a></h3>
<p>— Shuishen</p>
<p>Great literary works often arise in times of chaos and upheaval. The An Lushan Rebellion produced a Du Fu. The impact of this eight-year War of Resistance is immeasurably more profound than that of the An Lushan Rebellion. We should have many soul-stirring, immortal works worthy of the title "poetic history," to leave for future generations to read.</p>
<p>In Chongqing, due to the scarcity of paper and the difficulty of printing, many works have not been published, or at least we rarely see them. This summer, Master Juanhe sent me a copy of "Yong Yuan Ci Chao" from Nanjing. I had been too busy with personal matters to read it carefully until the end of the year and the beginning of the new year, when I had a little leisure to peruse it leisurely.</p>
<p>This is a collection of ci poetry by "exiles" who entered Sichuan, compiled by Yang Gongshu. The preface states: "I once traveled up the river to Sichuan with my wife and settled in Yong Yuan Garden in Shapingba, Yixian County. We both loved to write ci poetry and had a strong desire to collect it. The following year, the War of Resistance broke out, and many contemporary ci poets gathered in the Southwest. We heard many discussions. After nine years, following the story of Hong Ji Gongjin, we compiled this collection, also to record our association. However, limited by resources, we only tasted a small portion of the soup. Moreover, the favors of various families came at different times. Each time we obtained a collection, we immediately sent it to the printers, without having time to edit or arrange it. Therefore, we named it 'Ci Chao' (Collection of Ci Poetry)." The preface was completed in January of the 35th year [of the Republic, i.e. 1946], and the proofreader was Zhou Guangyu.</p>
<p>This anthology includes the ci poetry of eight authors: "Qing Meng Ci" by Ye Shisun, "Ling Suo Ci" by Wu Baitao, "Bo Wai Le Zhang" by Qiao Dazhuang, "She Jiang Ci" by Shen Zibi, "Jia An Ci" by Wang Dong, "Nan Yun Xiao Gao" by Tang Guizhang, "Nian Yuan Ci" by Song Ci, Shen Yinmo, "Juan He Jin Ti Yue Fu" by Chen Feishi, and an appendix of old-style poetry entitled "Jiu Shi Yue Se Qi Shi," also by Chen Feishi.</p>
<p>"Juan He Jin Ti Yue Fu" is titled "Ma Xie Ji" (Collection of Hemp Sandals). It has a postscript that reads: "I began studying ci poetry in the year of Wushen [1908]. After the age of fifty, my old friends Shao Cigong and Wu Qu'an often urged me to publish them. In the summer of Dingchou [1937], I had just finished writing three volumes and was about to discuss them with my two friends when the Lugou Bridge Incident occurred. My two friends passed away one after the other, and the old drafts were shelved. I set three rules for myself: to adhere to the rules of prosody, to be appropriate and smooth, and to avoid vulgarity and triviality in terms of artistic conception and overall tone, aiming to discipline myself, but I have not yet succeeded in graduating. These are works from the last seven years, and I dare not be confident in them, seeking improvement only." Although there are not many ci poems in the "Ma Xie Ji," I privately love one or two of them.</p>
<p>Bu Suan Zi (Divination Song)</p>
<p>Half the dream, each has... work, I compose this interpretation:</p>
<p>The horns of high autumn are broken, the sword is cold in the distant night, and lights flicker in the eyes of the wilderness. The moon shadow is faint, and the skinny horse has passed this road. Truly. Wet military uniform, old tears scattered in the wind. Towards... Continuing the journey like a crowing rooster, when will the floating mist and fog be broken? Good scenery is lightly cast aside.... Holding the golden immortal in the dew, there is nothing to be done about parting sorrow. Across the bank, the Western Mountains, hidden, like a pair of locked, dark eyebrows. Who can? Entrust my longing thoughts to the Liaocheng arrow. Listening to the remaining music while drunk by the flowing water, how sad it is to harmonize with the county's difficulties.</p>
<p>Shan Xi (Mountain Stream)</p>
<p>Hearing of the victory at Yichang on Double Tenth [October 10th]</p>
<p>Distant flutes and drums break through the evening haze of sorrow. Recalling past travels thirty years ago, embracing the Yellow Crane Tower, ascending halfway to the heavens. The rivers and mountains have two warnings: don't treat them like paintings. How many evenings, the moonlight was clear, lingering, illuminating the golden goblets filled to the brim. A good wind blows, carrying the sail shadow, following the Xiang River's turn. Pointing towards Jiangling for thousands of miles, the waves in the middle of the gorge display clouds for the first time. Youthful face with white hair, may dreams return home early. Beautiful land, stained with... carnage, whose house are the lights illuminating?</p>
<p>The entire book is one hundred and twelve pages long, filled with elegant words and beautiful phrases, each copy is invaluable.</p>
<p>Ye Xing Chuan (Night Boat) by Ye Shisun - Remembering Nanjing</p>
<p>Dreaming of the beautiful land of the Southern Dynasties. The east wind passes, the grass is dizzy, the flowers are drunk. Like a painting of the river and sky, the flock is startled and dances in confusion, making up the bright beauty of late spring. Not chasing after the rise and fall of dynasties before one's eyes. The places of joyful revelry have all become places of sorrow. The New Pavilion is well, but who is there to face? In vain, shedding tears towards the setting sun.</p>
<p>Tai Lan Hua (Magnolia) by Qiao Dazhuang</p>
<p>Youth often gets drunk in Jiangnan. Discussing songs to repay the wine's intention. In the mirror, one does not believe that the tides rise and fall; downstairs, you can see the depth of the water. Telling of longing thoughts across a thousand miles. Limited fragrant wine, limitless matters. Returning swallow feathers, returning geese to the north, my wife eats orangutan lips, my husband... carp.</p>
<p>Jian Zi Tai Lan Hua (Abbreviated Magnolia) by Shen Yinmo</p>
<p>Talking with Jiyuan [Wang Dong], feeling moved, I compose this and present it to Jiyuan.</p>
<p>Winding mountain paths, the houses of people across the ridge seem close but are actually far away. The same river and sky, it's not as good as Jiangnan for launching boats. These three years are vulgar, laugh at my lifelong thoughts of entering Shu. East of Wanli Bridge, it's hard to have a sentiment that surpasses Fang Weng [Lu You].</p>
<p>A small tripod [work], it ends here. The book does not state where it was published, nor does it have a fixed price, as it is not for sale.</p>
<h3 id="e149">Hardy and His "The Return of the Native" <a href="#e149" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c149" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">149</a></h3>
<p>— Shibei</p>
<p>(Written by Thomas Hardy, translated by Hai Guan, published by Zhengfeng Publishing House)</p>
<p>(I)</p>
<p>In recent years, American publications have included specialized studies of Thomas Hardy: Lord Robert Cecil's "Hardy the Novelist" and Carl J. Weber's "Hardy in America." Both books focus on the study of Hardy's novels. This proves that Hardy's works are still respected by readers and have lasting value.</p>
<p>Hardy was born on June 2, 1840, in Dorchester, Dorset, England. His family was in the building trade. At the age of sixteen, he became an architectural apprentice in Dorchester. At the age of twenty-two, he worked in the architectural firm of Sir Arthur Blomfield in London. There, he worked in architecture during the day and studied at the University of London in the evenings. He also worked hard at writing, publishing many novels, collections of poems, and essays, six or seven of which are considered great works of English fiction. He died in his hometown on January 11, 1928, at the age of eighty-two.</p>
<p>Having read Hardy's novels, we can vaguely glimpse his view of life. In his world, the position of mankind is the least important. Studying human intelligence and work is not enough for us to understand the mysteries of the universe, and the main rationality or irrationality of things. Man is not only constrained, suppressed, and insulted by his fellow men; he not only struggles with his fellow men; his misguided fate is not only caused by his fellow men; our world is full of unpredictable changes, and man, since he is born into this world, must be subject to the environment.</p>
<p>Because Hardy's view of life starts from this angle, his artistic ideal is Greek tragedy. He respected and inherited the spirit of the great Greek tragic poets Aeschylus and Sophocles, and he loved reading their tragedies. In 1880, he also read Schopenhauer and Hartmann, whose works deeply influenced Hardy's thinking. His novels unfold before us with a strong atmosphere of sentimentality.</p>
<p>(II)</p>
<p>If we first understand Hardy's view of life and his literary and artistic creation points, and then read "The Return of the Native," we can see that in "The Return of the Native," he has brought his art and his philosophical beliefs to their full height, so that his views on life are fully expressed. Because "The Return of the Native" has a complete, balanced, and appropriate structure, it has become the greatest and most outstanding of Hardy's tragic novels.</p>
<p>At the beginning of this book, Hardy wrote the following poem:</p>
<p>"I have said goodbye to sorrow,</p>
<p>I want to leave her far behind;</p>
<p>But she, joyfully, joyfully,</p>
<p>Clings to me intimately;</p>
<p>She is so faithful to me, so kind.</p>
<p>I want to deceive her,</p>
<p>And leave her from now on,</p>
<p>But, alas! She is so faithful to me,</p>
<p>So kind."</p>
<p>This poem lingers affectionately in our minds. It is the keynote of the novel, running through the entire story, beginning with sorrow and ending with sorrow.</p>
<p>The whole book is divided into six parts: Part One, Three Women; Part Two, The Return; Part Three, The Uneasiness; Part Four, The Closed Door; Part Five, Discovery; Part Six, Aftercourses. The background depicted by the author is the Egdon Heath, containing a hint of confusion like a dream; it is desolate, mysterious, and almost a symbol of the objective, ominous forces of nature, silently watching the fate of the men and women who live within this region. The first section describes: "This place now completely matches human nature - neither terrible nor hateful, nor ugly; neither ordinary nor vulgar; but like mankind, it is neglected and continues in monotonous twilight with only its vastness and mystery. Being with people who have been living alone for a long time, loneliness seems to have lost its color. This is a lonely place, suggesting the possibility of tragedy." That is the background of "The Return of the Native," which the author has personified.</p>
<p>The story begins with fireworks on November 5th. Red lights rise one after another, decorating the entire countryside. Bunches of pale yellow light radiate in fan shapes around the dense air. The destinies of the tender Daisi [Eustacia Vye] and the beautiful heroine Wu Sidaisha [Eustacia Vye] are concentrated in this environment. The middle is the transition to welcoming Klin Yuebolai [Clym Yeobright]'s return from Paris. And take marriage as the final outcome, first Daisi's marriage to Weidifu [Wildeve], and then Wu Sidaisha and Klin Yuebolai's marriage. But these two couples are not satisfied with the love they have obtained, so on January 5th of the following year, they encountered an accidental fire signal, which caused Wu Sidaisha and Cheng Difu [Wildeve] to flee on a dark and rainy night. In the end, they both tragically drowned in the wilderness's waters. In the tragic stormy night, in the shining whirlpools and white foam, that is the destination of love.</p>
<p>However, in the "Aftercourses" of the novel, the author allows us to see, through the sad tragic atmosphere, a thread of sincere and simple union of a newly born love, and a life of eternal devotion to duty. The former is Daisi and the humble red earth peddler - Di Geli [Diggory Ven] Huai En's [Wildeve] marriage; the latter is Klin Yuebolai ending his life on Rainbarrow in evangelistic work. Although some critics say that this part is superfluous, I cherish it, just as Hardy uses the hymn to eulogize Daisi's revived love:</p>
<p>"She calls her lover from above the mist,</p>
<p>Oh, come in,</p>
<p>The dew is so thick, so thick!"</p>
<p>At this point, we can see the disillusionment of love, and also the rebirth of pure love.</p>
<p>(III)</p>
<p>In "The Return of the Native," Hardy brings out his certain sense of drama, the appropriateness of the atmosphere and layout, and the tight structure, all of which make its content extraordinary. From the perspective of the description of scenery, "The Return of the Native" is also the most successful work. Hardy believes that scenery is the primary element of a novel, and an indispensable thing for the development of the story. In "The Return of the Native," he uses his poetic pastoral method to express the image of the scenery. This is what we should pay special attention to. J.W. Cunliffe once said: "The Return of the Native" is a magnificent building; its story moves lightly at the height of human destiny, without haste or wasted effort, and the technique is very perfect, the subtle places, we only understand after careful examination. Touching or humorous scenes follow one after another, and we follow with ever-increasing attention to the designated destination; we see how each tiny part appropriately constitutes the complete whole."</p>
<p>This explains the creation technique of "The Return of the Native." I think this should also be the most appropriate evaluation for "The Return of the Native." If readers are tired of Hardy's tragic novels, reading "The Return of the Native" will certainly not be "tired," but rewarding.</p>

<p>— Heku</p>
<p>I think one of the reasons why everyone likes the Lunar New Year more than the Solar New Year is because in the few days approaching the Lunar New Year, we can more or less get a sum of money in addition to our monthly salary and allowance, as long as you work in a business, organization, or institution where even making a living is difficult. This sum of money is sometimes called a year-end bonus, sometimes a year-end allowance, sometimes a profit-sharing, but it is an extra part of the income.</p>
<p>In this city, I don't know how many families rely on this extra sum of money, let's call it "year-end funds" for now, to get the warmth that they can't get on ordinary days. For example, children may be able to eat some sweets that they usually long for but are difficult to obtain easily, wives may be able to wear a piece of clothing that they usually see in the window but can't afford, and they themselves may dare to invite a few close friends to their home for a lunch that is slightly more lavish than usual... etc. If there is no year-end fund, then even if the aforementioned warmth is requested like a fleeting udumbara flower, it is difficult to achieve.</p>
<p>As usual, these year-end funds, judging from the individual names such as "year-end allowance," "year-end bonus," and "profit sharing," are mostly issued voluntarily by one party, and should be released naturally at a certain time, just as plum blossoms should bloom in spring and chrysanthemums should bloom in autumn. But the reality is not so. Today's "year-end funds" must be fought for and demanded before they can be obtained, which also shows the seriousness of the general situation of "difficult times, barren years, and empty family fortunes."</p>
<p>In fact, the distribution of year-end funds is still beneficial to the "market." Because the general "receivers" who have long lacked warmth, after receiving this money, still "give" it to society. No matter how withered the year is, or how urgent the scenery is, they always exchange some things to take home. The family certainly gets warmth, and at the same time, the market also gets warmth. From this point of view, the giving party should be calm and generous in opening their wallets.</p>
<p>To this day, this year-end fund is no longer about savings, but a kind of hope and bestowal, a kind of warm giving and receiving. If there is spring in winter, it is that one party reveals a fleeting beauty on a heavy face after giving and receiving.</p>
<h3 id="e151">On Diaries <a href="#e151" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c151" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">151</a></h3>
<p>— Lu Naizhen</p>
<p>Some people keep diaries, some people don't. Probably, more people don't keep diaries. I also don't keep a diary. I think that ordinary diary keeping is like keeping a running account or writing a dry and uninteresting record of daily life. Keeping it for a long time seems like a kind of punishment, something that must be done every day but is unwilling to do. It's like a poor man who has never eaten any nutritious food before. Suddenly, he has money and quickly buys a five-pound can of Klim milk powder. He eats it happily for the first few days, but after eating it for a few days, well, he can't stand eating it anymore. All the nutrition and delicious taste have become a kind of punishment. If he doesn't eat it, the milk powder will spoil. If he eats it, he's tired of eating it. So, he has to swallow it hard, or ask someone else to eat it. Keeping a diary is the same. At the beginning, you keep it with great energy, but after a month or two, you become impatient. You keep it one day and skip one day, and after another month or two, you simply stop keeping it altogether. No wonder Robert Louis Stevenson, the author of "Treasure Island," said that keeping a diary is a "practice of a profession," and you must have the spirit of going to the office on time to be able to keep it from beginning to end.</p>
<p>If you say that a diary is a trace of life, that's not entirely true. You can't record the two major events of a person's life, birth and death. As for some trivial things, like "Mother sent a letter today...", "Damn it, we ate turnips again for lunch, there was an uproar in the dining hall..." These things can neither be used as material for writing an autobiography after you become a celebrity in the future, nor are they precious "traces of life." As for the major events of one's life, such as first love, marriage, university graduation, etc., even if you don't write them down, the process before and after will be firmly engraved in your heart.</p>
<p>Personal diaries are inevitably peeked at by others, and there are many things that you often can't boldly write down. Diaries can sometimes show your true feelings, but there are also many cases of offending friends or even ending up in prison because of this.</p>
<p>I don't keep a diary. I would rather write down some things that are worth remembering as independent novels or essays, so I don't have to be afraid of people peeking at them, and I can also practice writing. The plot in a novel is like a rope of memory, which will lead me to think of a large area of past events.</p>
<p>Keeping a diary was originally the best way to start learning to write, but unfortunately, most people keep it as a dry and uninteresting running account, so that it has nothing to do with literature. Being able to write down the major events and feelings of the day in a few lines of notes, like Mr. Hu Shi's "Cang Hui Shi Da Ji," is certainly easy. Otherwise, as Mr. Zhu Guangqian said: "You don't have to predetermine the number of words you should record every day, as long as you record what should be recorded just right, whether it's hundreds of words or dozens of words, you don't have to be restrictive. You also don't have to record many things at the same time in one day. If you record too much, you will inevitably be like 'counting radishes to store in the cellar,' and you will never remember them well. Selection is the most important work of literature. You select one thing worth remembering every day, and record it properly, turning it into a 'work,' that's enough." Otherwise, it's better not to keep it, to avoid suffering "punishment" in vain.</p>

<p>— Mang</p>
<p>More than one million people in India burn incense and pray every day, hoping to be cremated in the prominent charnel ground after death.</p>
<p>After a person dies in India, the body is immediately moved out of the house. Men are wrapped in white cloth, while women are wrapped in red cloth. However, those who die from terrible diseases such as leprosy or smallpox, as well as children, are not wrapped at all, but simply thrown into the Ganges River.</p>
<p>The ceremony of carrying the dead to the cremation ground is very simple. There is no so-called hearse. The dead body is only tied to a bamboo pole and carried on the shoulders of two relatives, walking to the river while singing.</p>
<p>After arriving at the river, they give the dead person one last bath in the sacred river, and then build a fire to cremate the body. After building a pile of wood about four feet high, they put the dead body on the wood pile, and piled a lot of dried cow dung on the chest of the dead body. Then, the widowed woman, with her head shaved and wearing white clothes, brought fire from a sacred place, put a piece of meat in her husband's mouth, and circled the wood pile five times, then, without any expression, she lit a fire on a pile in front of her husband's chest.</p>
<p>The fire burned quickly. But the widow still used a long bamboo pole to stir it from time to time, calling the fire to burn faster.</p>
<p>After the fire went out, the widow threw all the unburned parts into the river. At the same time, her relatives also brought her to the water's edge and took off all the gold and silver ornaments on her wrists and legs and threw them into the river. Then, she took a clay pot of water from the river, carried it on her shoulder, walked to the ashes of the corpse, and poured it straight down. Then she went straight back, without even turning her head.</p>

<p>— Lei Hong</p>
<p>Two brothers committed the crime of stealing sheep and were caught by the victim, who tattooed two letters on their foreheads: ST, meaning "sheep thief."</p>
<p>The older brother could not bear this humiliating symbol and prepared to live in seclusion in a strange place. But people were curious about the letters on his forehead and asked him what they meant. He was so ashamed that he couldn't answer, wandered back and forth, and finally, with the deepest pain, committed suicide and died, buried far away from home.</p>
<p>The younger brother thought, "I can't escape the crime of stealing sheep anyway, I want to live here, regain my reputation, and make my neighbors look up to me." As the years passed, the younger brother actually established his clear reputation.</p>
<p>One day, an outsider saw the letters on the old man's forehead. He asked the local villagers what these letters meant. "That was a long time ago," the villagers said. "I was born too late to know the details of that time, but I think the letters are probably an abbreviation for 'Saint' (Saint)."</p>
<h3 id="e155">Cilang Island <a href="#e155" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c155" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">155</a></h3>
<p>— Zheng Guoyi</p>
<p>A certain newspaper's supplement contained "Record of Song Gentleman Xie Ao," with thorough and comprehensive textual research, for which I deeply admire it. However, I fear that referring to the gentleman by the name Xie Gaoyu (Ao) is inappropriate; Gaoyu initially followed Wen Tianxiang in his military campaigns, enduring hardship and danger, disregarding death and valuing life, hardly a recluse. Even after the fall of the Song Dynasty, though he hid and fled, the sorrow of a lost homeland, the pain of abandoning the imperial ancestral temple was expressed through mournful cries at the West Terrace. His writings and deeds are enough to change the universe and move ghosts and gods to tears. Even now, a thousand years later, one can still vividly imagine the man, making it impossible to compare him to the Jin recluse Tao Jingjie (Yuanming).</p>
<p>Jingjie briefly served during the late Jin Dynasty and then retired, never emerging again after the dynasty's change. Such a person can rightly be called a recluse. Gaoyu's experiences were incomparable to this. I believe it would be better to call him a "loyalist," which better reflects Gaoyu's original aspirations and preserves his true character. I venture to offer this presumptuous opinion, wondering if it meets with the approval of discerning minds. Gaoyu's tomb is in Guangdong, and his descendants are scattered throughout Chaoyang. These facts are recorded in the county gazetteer, but whether there is any fabrication involved is unknown. I am a native of Chaoyang, and I once spoke with local elders about Xie Gaoyu, but they were mostly bewildered and unaware of the details, vaguely wondering who Xie Gaoyu was. Chaoyang's literary atmosphere has long been poor, and historical traces are generally unknown. Speaking of this, I cannot help but sigh with grief! The attribution of ancient tombs to famous figures is not unique to Xie Gaoyu in Chaozhou; even the tomb of Prime Minister Lu (Xiufu) is subject to doubt. Lu Xiufu, carrying the Song Emperor (　), jumped into the sea, his body lost in the waves. Where could his bones have come from? It is undoubtedly a fabrication by well-intentioned individuals. (Xiufu was from Yancheng, and it is said that Yancheng also has a tomb of Prime Minister Lu, which makes it even more incomprehensible.) Many traces of Lu Xiufu are recorded in the Chaozhou prefectural gazetteer. Besides the tomb, there is Cilang Island, located on an isolated island off the coast of Nan'ao, 120 miles east of Raoping city, also named after Prime Minister Lu. One account says that at the end of the Song Dynasty, the Chaozhou local military commander Zhang Da advocated righteousness and escorted the imperial boat. Zhang Da's wife, Chen Biniang, saw him off here and bid him farewell. The words "farewell" and "serve" are homophones, so it is actually "Cilang Island" and not "Serving Official Island." The prefectural gazetteer records Chen Zhengyan's argument for Serving Official Island, saying: "North of Nan'ao Mountain, at Qingjing Estuary, there is the Prime Minister's tomb. The Prime Minister once served as a vice minister of the Ministry of Rites, so it is fitting that the island is named after the Prime Minister." It also says: "Scholars studying the past should be skeptical and reserve judgment when in doubt. If certainty is unattainable, they should follow the greater principle, to see the unwavering loyalty and dedication of righteous officials, who, when all hope was lost, drove their wives and children into the sea and gave their lives to protect the Emperor. Zhang Da and his wife's farewell at the crossroads is a trivial matter, and the evidence is remote and lacking. The island's name should follow Lu and not Zhang." It also records Zhou Shoxun's argument for Cilang Island, saying: "In Nan'ao, Chaozhou, there is an island called Cilang Island. It is traditionally said that Song Commander Zhang Da escorted the imperial boat to Hongluo Mountain, and his wife, Chen Biniang, saw him off at this island, hence the name. It implies knowing that success was impossible and there would be no return, so it is not called 'sending the husband' but 'bidding farewell to the husband.' The Historical Outline records: Commander Zhang Da launched a night attack on the Yuan army and was defeated. Zhang Da was a real person. It is also traditionally said that Da died in battle at Yaishan, and Biniang sought out his corpse and buried it, dying of starvation. Thus, the husband was loyal and the wife virtuous, parting forever in this place, the island named after the event, the island known through the people. But Chen Zhengyan recklessly changed it to Serving Official Island, attributing it to Lu. Lu retired to Chaozhou when he was a direct scholar of the Bachelor's Academy. He was not known to be a vice minister of the Ministry of Rites, so the place where he lived was called the Scholar's Hall. Why is it now called Serving Official Island instead of Scholar's Island?" It also says: "The position of commander is not low. Ling Zhen was a commander, and the Historical Outline annotates his surrender to the Yuan. Zhang Da was a commander, and it records his night attack on the Yuan army. Zhang Da was an outstanding figure among countless dead soldiers. Why do later generations consider him a commoner?" Such are the differences and similarities in the debate between Serving Official Island and Cilang Island. However, Zhou Shoxun's insight is remarkable. His words, "Knowing that success was impossible and there would be no return, so it is not called 'sending the husband' but 'bidding farewell to the husband,'" and "The husband was loyal and the wife virtuous, parting forever in this place, the island named after the event, the island known through the people," are particularly profound. Regardless of whether Zhang Da's story is a fabrication or not, as described here, it is both sad and heroic, a great subject for poetry. It is a pity that no one has put it into verse for contemporary people to recite. Chen Zhengyan's narrow view that "Zhang Da was an overseas military man, dying in the vanguard, who can also attach himself to the Prime Minister to contend for fame for thousands of years" (from Chen Zhengyan's argument for Serving Official Island) is truly vulgar. "Overseas military men, dying in the vanguard," though different in status from the Prime Minister, share the same dedication to defending the country and resisting foreign invasion. What difference does rank make? Not knowing this makes it difficult to be a scholar. Chaozhou scholars have historically rarely studied historical records, and Chen Zhengyan is a prime example. (Zhengyan was from Raoping, a licentiate through tribute selection in the Qing Dynasty.)</p>

<p>Chapter Eight: Failure at the Last Moment (49)</p>
<p>Zhu Zhai was taken aback when he saw Yun Qing's stern face and heard her words. He laughed and said, "Can't you see my heart? I have nothing to say now, but future actions will prove it." Yun Qing nodded and said, "I'll be watching you." Zhu Zhai said, "I hope you'll be watching me. I'll go back today and negotiate with her." Yun Qing said, "Be careful in everything you do." Zhu Zhai said, "I'll go now. I'll negotiate with her first. If I need you, I'll call you and ask you to come and help." Yun Qing said, "It's better for the two of you to negotiate yourselves; there's no need for me." Zhu Zhai said, "I can't do without you." After saying that, he left in a hurry.</p>
<p>When Zhu Zhai returned home, he saw Feng Sheng still wearing a blue cloth jacket, working in the kitchen. He went straight to the bedroom, sat on a sofa near the bed, and pondered whether he should initiate the conversation or provoke her to do so. While he was thinking, Feng Sheng came in. Zhu Zhai closed his eyes, as if he didn't see her. After Yun Qing left, Feng Sheng became increasingly angry. Seeing Zhu Zhai in the house, ignoring her, she couldn't contain her anger. She stood in front of Zhu Zhai, put her hands on her hips, and loudly asked, "Zhu Zhai! What are you planning? Tell me clearly! I can't stand this ambiguity. I'm a living person, not a ghost. You can't treat me like this." Zhu Zhai was closing his eyes and thinking, and when he heard this, he thought his chance had come. He slightly opened his eyes, glanced at Feng Sheng, and said, "What are you saying? What people, ghosts? I don't understand at all!" Feng Sheng said, "Stop pretending! Speak clearly! What are you scheming? I know all your tricks. You want to cast me aside and not treat me like a person. I won't agree." Zhu Zhai said, "I still don't understand." Feng Sheng said, "You married me as your wife, but you don't treat me like a wife. What does that mean?" Zhu Zhai said, "Are you really the wife I wanted to marry?" Zhu Zhai's words were like a sharp sword, deeply hurting Feng Sheng's heart. In a mixture of anger and resentment, she said with a sob, "If you think I'm not the wife you wanted to marry, then you should divorce me!" Zhu Zhai said, "Divorce! This is your idea, not me forcing you to divorce." Feng Sheng patted her chest and said, "Yes! As long as you agree to my conditions, I'll divorce you." Zhu Zhai said, "If you really have the guts, I'll agree to you." Feng Sheng patted her chest again and said, "What am I afraid of! I'm only afraid you can't meet my conditions." Zhu Zhai said, "Tell me." Feng Sheng put one hand on her hip, raised the other, and gave a thumbs up, saying, "First condition: alimony. All existing housing and everything in it will belong to me, to be disposed of by me, and you must not interfere. You must also give me a considerable amount of living expenses every month. Can you do that?" Zhu Zhai responded softly, "That's acceptable."</p>

<p>If there were a global atomic war, the world would become a world of insects. There are two reasons: 1. The number of insects is already far greater than the total number of humans; 2. Insects' ability to resist atomic radiation is twenty to forty times higher than that of humans.</p>
<p>Besides insects, the second most dominant species in the world after an atomic war should be rats. Rats' ability to resist the radiation produced by atomic fission is inferior to that of insects, but far stronger than that of humans. Moreover, according to a 1947 report by the U.S. Department of the Interior, even in a country like the United States, which has not experienced war and where the general population pays considerable attention to hygiene, the rat "population" is already equal to the human population.

<p>— Pingzhai</p>
<p>One day in mid-January 1944, in the dressing room of a famous London theater, the famous actor Clifton James was removing his makeup when someone suddenly knocked on the door. James thought it was probably another fan asking for an autograph and lazily called out, "Come in!"</p>
<p>However, the person who came in was his old friend, the famous movie star David Niven. David was in full military uniform, having already joined the army and become a major in the British Army. During their cheerful conversation, David suddenly asked him if he could take some photos. James naturally agreed. But David had many tricks. He took off his leather military jacket and asked James to wear it, and also gave James his military cap. He also asked him to put his hands in his pockets and puff out his arms. Then, with a flash of bright light, David happily said goodbye.</p>
<p>A week later, James suddenly received an official letter from the British military, asking him to report to Colonel Leicester at the Lister Hotel the next day. James of course obeyed. Colonel Leicester welcomed him warmly, and standing next to Leicester was David Niven, smiling broadly.</p>
<p>Colonel Leicester said, "You probably know that your face looks a lot like General Montgomery?"</p>
<p>A silence followed.</p>
<p>Leicester sized James up and asked, "Are you a patriotic person?"</p>
<p>James said, "Of course!"</p>
<p>"Then please sign here."</p>
<p>James glanced at it briefly and resolutely signed this confidential document.</p>
<p>David Niven said, "James, we want you to play General Montgomery."</p>
<p>James wanted to laugh, but Colonel Leicester and David Niven had suddenly become serious, and James didn't dare to laugh. So Leicester told him that General Montgomery had been appointed by the Allied High Command a month earlier to lead a large army to break through the European fortress. German intelligence agents were closely watching Montgomery's movements, because they could deduce where to strike based on the areas he inspected.</p>
<p>The military's request to James was very simple: starting from that day, he should contact General Montgomery, imitate his voice, actions, and walk, so that even Montgomery's closest friends could not tell the difference between the real and the fake. James thought: This was not an easy task. However, like rehearsing a difficult play, he began to work. He grew a mustache, dyed his hair white, and added "shoulder pads" to his clothes. Every day, he carefully watched how General Montgomery ate, how he washed, how he slept, and what his catchphrases were. General Montgomery himself was as happy as a child, enthusiastically teaching him everything. James liked to eat eggs, but Montgomery never ate eggs, so he had to give them up. His fingers had to be free of any yellow stains, because Montgomery didn't smoke. Montgomery didn't drink alcohol, so James quit drinking.</p>
<p>It wasn't until late May that he "performed."</p>
<p>That morning, he was in full military uniform, with many medals. He publicly boarded a military car, and as the car started, the crowd cheered thunderously! So he waved to the crowd from the car window and sat back comfortably...</p>
<p>The car arrived at the airfield. The airfield staff stood at attention. The plane door opened, and everyone saluted. Leicester guarded him and respectfully said, "Goodbye, General." He then lightly added, "Gibraltar." James carried a briefcase, filled with instructions, telling him who to see and what to say.</p>
<p>When he arrived in Gibraltar, James scanned the airfield with his eagle eyes, got off the plane gracefully, and Gibraltar Governor Sir Evesham hurried forward to greet him. James patted his vest and called him "Old Eve."</p>
<p>He stayed in Gibraltar until dusk, actually convened military meetings, held award ceremonies, and after a busy day, flew to Algiers. There he was again received with great enthusiasm, with the whole city turning out to welcome him. But after he arrived at his "residence," he spent every day hiding in the small building, playing cards with his bodyguard and listening to the radio.</p>
<p>On June 3, he arrived at the airfield again under tight military and police protection. This time it was to Cairo. In Cairo, he played until June 7, the day after the general offensive began. Then his mission was over, and he happily returned to London. Colonel Leicester, as soon as he saw him, gave him a smart salute and then handed him a check, saying, "General, this is your salary—calculated according to the general's salary!"</p>
