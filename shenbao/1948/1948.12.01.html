<h3 id="c1">蚌宿會戰有利發展　北上國軍昨已進抵固鎭　裝甲兵團在徐州東南攻克劉莊 <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿八日電〕據今晚此間有關方面接獲報吿，津浦綫目蚌埠北上國軍，今晚已將固鎮收復，但此訊未經軍方發表。</p>
<p>〔本報蚌埠三十日電〕蚌·宿會戰仍在國軍之主動行動下發展中，目前戰事序幕雖已揭開，但尙未至火併階段。共匪移師南下，據軍方估計，當在二十萬人左右，大部主力在自徐州南指之孫·邱·李·三兵團緊逼之下，刻竄集津浦路西澮河兩岸，一部約四萬餘人，已越過澥河（在澮河與北淝河之間）向壞遠方面移動。另股約五千人，則指向曹老集。昨夜有散匪二百餘，竄至曹老集以西，經國軍出撃，已全部被殲。國軍方面則根據原有決策，在北淝河畔完成部署，故共匪之節節南移，殆將陷入泥沼中而不能自拔。</p>
<p>〔本報蚌埠卅日電〕（一）劉峙昨午後曾專機飛前綫視察。（二）空軍廿九日協同地面部隊作戰，在新橋正面炸斃匪萬餘。（三）蚌埠今日起將戒嚴時間提早半小時，自午後九時開始。</p>
<p>〔本報蚌埠卅日電〕今日此間南下車仍照常開出，北上車已停駛。</p>
<p>〔合衆社南京卅日電〕政府三十日正式否認下令撤退徐州之說，同時半官方消息承認蘇北主力戰區正逐漸南移中。蚌埠現成爲戰爭之焦點所在，獨眼將軍劉伯承在西，陳毅在東，共軍攻勢之先頭部隊繼續南下。下令撤退徐州之謠傳，顯因宣佈徐州剿總司令劉時之總部移至蚌埠，及兩兵團向南挺進而起。</p>
<p>〔本報徐州卅日電〕裝甲部隊在協同邱兵團撃潰徐州東南十二公里之劉塘河以東門魯中南（卽十六）縱隊，並繼續攻佔徐州東南五十華里之劉莊，是役鹵獲電機槍廿挺，輕機槍卅挺，步槍五百餘枝，斃匪三千餘名，俘匪三百餘名。</p>
<p>〔本報南京卅日電〕裝甲兵司令部參謀長蔣緯國中校，偕政工處長陳守成，卅日上午十時專機飛徐，並携帶大批慰勞品，宣慰參與徐州會戰之裝甲部隊官兵。</p>

<p>〔中央社太原卅日電〕幷垣西山區塵戰方酣，城西約四十華里之化七頭當面匪第五旅一部，卅日晨再向我陣地猛犯，經守軍沉着應戰，陣地屹立無恙，迄晚仍與匪對戰中。另匪新四旅一部，向沙溝梁以西高地猛撲，激戰至下午三時許我應援部隊趕至內外夾撃，匪腹背受創，急向沙溝梁西北地區退竄。據初步統計，兩地今共計斃傷匪千餘人。</p>
<p>〔本報天津三十日電〕冀東尙無大戰徵兆，惟共匪流竄情形亟堪重視。灤縣及以西之垞子頭雷莊等地，三十日已被匪竄據。然濼河橋廿八日經國軍破壞，匪已無法利用，國軍現於古冶礦區完成嚴密佈署。又，秦楡撤退之各方人員，三十日已陸續抵津。</p>

<h3 id="c18">徐州戰事勝利評價 <a href="#c18" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e18" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">18</a></h3>
<p>— 本報記者　丁維棟</p>
<p>二十天來咸脅徐州的嚴重軍事危機，現在已經像惡夢般的消逝。當然，在蚌·宿戰事尙未吿一段落前，徐東的決戰還談不到使華中戰局整個改變，但至少已換得一兩月珍貴的時間，使軍事當局能從容部署，來挽回濟南和東北失守後幾乎不可收拾的頺勢。同時，此間軍政人員和來徐觀戰的中外記者一致同意，這次勝利的最大意義，是重新建立了國軍的信心和士氣。</p>
<p>制勝因素</p>
<p>在敵對方面說，徐州大會戰是過度自信心理下的產物。因爲匪方想孤注一擲，一勞永逸。其動員兵力之多，亦爲過去所未有。匪方作戰的最高指導原則，是不輕易和國軍主力週旋，卽使打硬仗，亦是所謂「局部決戰」，不肯孤注一擲。可是這次情形逈異，陳毅和劉伯承竟發動魯豫皖的全部實力，以極大的優勢，猛撲這座華東名城。據官方的估計，劉陳兩部運用的總兵力，約在六十萬人左右，內中十分之八是陳毅的部隊，也就是和國軍黃伯韜在碾莊決戰的主力，劉伯承部五個縱隊的兵力，則在津浦南綫擔任牽制國軍的任務。兵力雖是以陳毅爲主體，作戰力亦是他優越，但是負指揮全責的却是劉伯承。據杜聿明將軍的解釋，大概是陳毅是共匪中後起之秀，論資格，遠在劉之下，同時後者之用兵狡點，亦是爲國軍所熟知的。</p>
<p>應付這種大攻勢的國軍兵力，不幸是居於劣勢的地位。在這個戰區，國軍可運用的兵力，約有六個兵團（黃伯韜·邱淸泉·李彌·孫元良。李延年·黃維），但是由於共匪主攻，國軍主守，在一個遼闊的戰區中，不免備多力分，據估計：國軍在徐州東西兩綫的兵力，僅有三十萬人，在數量上是居於劣勢的不利地位。國軍所賴以制勝的工具，第一是幾個極端精銳的兵團，其裝備訓練之佳，非共匪關內部隊所能及。陳毅的部隊在濟南之捷後，得到的重裝備甚多，這次就用來攻擊徐州外圍，陳毅部是共匪在關內火力最旺盛的軍隊，但如果拿來和國軍邱淸泉兵團相比，相去尙遠。邱兵團擁有大小各種口徑的砲，在一千門之上，而園攻黃兵團的陳毅主力，使用的砲不過在二百門左右，火力是五對一之比。其次是戰車部隊，在這次大會戰中，共匪所最感恐懼的，是國軍戰車的活躍。說也可憐，國軍現在所用的坦克，尙是緬印戰塲所接收過來的輕型戰車，幾年來並沒有獲得補充，同時因各戰塲均迫切需要，實力大爲分散。美國朋友估計國軍使用在徐州戰塲上的坦克，爲數約在六十輛左右，實際上是遠在這數字之下。可是數量雖少，在攻堅時對於犧牲的减少，官兵一致承認。只要看徐州外圍戰事吿一段落後，裝甲兵司令部參謀長蔣緯國卽奉命赴台灣，籌設戰車訓練學校，就可以看出裝甲部隊在戰爭中的重要性，中樞已有深刻的印像了。國軍還有一個制勝的因素是空軍，這裏須包括作戰和供應兩方面，値得特別提明的，後者的貢獻也許比前者更重要。空軍對於對方地面部隊的威脅，據前綫國軍的意見，也許是由於數量的限制，其作用不如後方人民所想像之大。例如，以轟炸而論，徐州外圍的許多村莊，今日已成焦土，在飛機經過上空時，歷歷可見。但是，據國軍的士兵言，共匪現在守村莊時，守四週而不守丙部，而且防空壕掘得十分得法，因此空襲造成的傷亡，並不很大·不過，此次國軍陸空配合得很好，地面部隊配有對空講話器，隨時和空軍聯絡，協同攻繫敵方的據點；砲兵由於空軍的前導，更發揮了精確射擊的優點，這點長處，對於國軍的勝利貢獻很大，無怪匪方揚言如果俘獲國軍的空軍和砲兵，一定要以不人道的刑罰報復了。空軍的供應部隊，在這次大會戰中，可醫喻作沉默的無名英雄，實際上他們是主要的勝利建築者。舉一個最明顯的事實來說，徐州東綫激戰時，津浦南綫因兵力空虛，在宿縣失守之後，供應綫已被切斷，徐州在事實上已成孤城。如果沒有空中補給的話，大軍的糧食都成問題。但是，空運部隊就在這時候發揮作用，把南京方面的食米和軍火源源不絕的運往前方，而把徐州的傷兵大量移送後方治療，他們日夜不斷的努力，對於士氣的維持，其貢獻是難於衝量的。（下接第四版）</p>

<h3 id="c19">上海難民問題之處置 <a href="#c19" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e19" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">19</a></h3>
<p>近日以來，大江以北的難民，如潮湧似的來到上海。社會局面對此項嚴重問題，除積極發動勸募冬令救濟外，並已呈請市府轉呈中央速訂解決辦法，澈底予以救濟疏散，避免各處難民麕集一處。上海已經是五百萬人口的都市，食糧燃料的來源已十分艱難；而今値此非常時期，社會動盪，人心不安，如再加上時屆寒冬，使救濟難民更成爲一樁嚴重可慮的事。上海市當局對於難民的救濟，勇於負責，我們深感贊同，並希望迅速有效的處置橫在當前的難民問題，以减削難民集中都市的現象。</p>
<p>上海本爲貧富懸殊苦樂不均的都市，每年上海人口的增加，貧苦無吿的人民亦隨之增加。這些貧民與來自北地的難民，佔上海人口數字很大，成爲最嚴重的社會問題。據本報記者今年二月調査，除流浪街頭的貧民難民難以估計外，僅棲居於棚戶的窮苦同胞，卽有六萬四千餘戶之多，計分：滬南一萬五千戶，約八萬餘人：滬西一萬五千戶，約九萬餘人；滬北八千戶，約五萬餘人；滬東二萬戶，約十萬餘人：浦東六千戶，約三萬人。今年以來，難民入口與日俱增，市警局調査六月份約有一萬六千餘難民未經收容，六月以後，繼來者猶源源不絕尤其近月以來，津浦沿綫和蘇北難民，更先後湧至，分佈於市鄉，或已被當局收容，或尙躑躅街頭，孤苦伶仃，不知何處是其歸依之所。從社會安全上脫，這是上海社會安寗秩序的威脅；從社會問題上說，這是上海市民推已及人，樂善好施的最良機會。</p>
<p>先說社會救濟：貧民難民的救濟，本爲社會救濟之一種·上海市往昔對於難民的救濟，有「冬令救濟會」的設立，其主要工作爲庇寒與施粥，這是含有施捨與慈善的意味，尙未能配合行政計劃去作。「冬令救濟會」於四月結束，成立「上海市救濟委員會」，於繼續冬令救濟工作之外，並計劃辦理積極性之福利措施，藉以安定失業和流民難民的生活。因爲數月來，先祗注意於籌款及設計工作，致「救濟院」「平民村」「工脤所」的舉辦，還均無從談起。現在歲寒冬至，時局又極嚴重，難民問題追在眉睫，希望救濟委員會奮發努力，一本往年冬令救濟的經騐，迅卽展開救濟工作，尤望地方仁人志士，根據扶弱濟貧的精神，協助政府和救濟機關，推行各項救濟。這雖不能完全解决社會問題，但消極的可以消弭社會問題的隱患，則毫無疑義。</p>
<p>次說社會安全。非常時期的社會安全，雖不完全受難民問題的威脅，而難民增加到動盪不安的社會中，却可構成地方政府的一種重大負担，如食糧衣着的負担，以及起居安全的負担；追些負担對於社會的安寗秩序，直接間接是有影響的。因此非常時期地方政府爲確保社會安全而處置難民問題，除了消極的收容予以救濟外，應該有效的疏散難民，减少難民集中的現象。這確是很重要的事，應該卽知卽行的了。疏散辦法的一方面，是有計劃的扶助難民重返鄉里，如暫時不能返鄉，應疏散於人口稀少之省區，從事農田耕作與工業生產，不要讓集中都市的流散之民，留連忘返。疏散辦法的另一方面，是嚴格限制難民的入境，凡上海入口的港口和車站，必須嚴予檢査登記，無親朋可依或生產工作者拒絕入口，仍予免費送返，或由鄰近各縣予以收容，而由本市津貼其費用。這些疏散辦法，槪是助人爲快樂之本的辦法，合乎情理，當無多大杆格難行之處。</p>
<p>總之，當前上海的難民問題，已構成嚴重的社會問題，如不亟從社會救濟與社會安全兩方面作有效的處置，則對於上海市安全的威脅，將是可慮的事。</p>

<p>〔聯合社柏林三十日電〕蘇聯支援之德共黨今日在柏林另設市政府，俾與反共市政府對立。反共市政府將於本星期日由市民正式選舉，柏林蘇佔區已禁止市民參加投票。</p>
<p>〔合衆社柏林三十日電〕德共黨三十日召集大示威，擁護東界成立蘇聯所策劃之單獨政府聲中，西德當局下令警察戒備。德警特種單位奉派戒備於蘇英兩界接境處，該地於三十日下午將有三萬工人集於「菩提樹下」大道，藉與九月九日之反共前議會大示威爭一日之短長。工人於恭聆演說後，將整隊游行至國家藝術學院前，該地三百名市參會之「民主議室」，將產生東柏林之單獨政府，而最後分裂市政而使柏林完全分裂。政治專家相信共黨行動，旨在抵消下星期日西區之市政選舉。</p>
<p>〔合衆社柏林廿九日電〕柏林共黨及蘇聯當局廿九日已在艦釀將柏林投入一新危機中，彼等顯然準備頒佈在蘇聯區成立一赤色德國政府。德境蘇軍總司令索柯洛夫斯基已正式書面向德境西方軍事長官抗議七日之市選舉。索氏斥責稱，此項選舉乃經由「民主組織之警察迫害手段」强迫加諸於德人者。索氏並以採取行動反對市政府中之反民主份子。此乃將柏林分裂爲二。柏林美軍總司令，霍關上校在記者招待會議中，就共黨之威脅與西方盟國決定在西區舉行市選舉二事稱，蘇聯之策動乃爲「以武力統治」計劃之一部份。霍氏又稱，東西間在外交上完全攤牌之時問業已成熟。柏林僅係東西決裂之危機中心，在柏林問題能完全解决前，蘇聯必須改變其態度。第一，蘇聯應解除柏林封鎖，在政治上停止使用武力。第二，蘇聯不但在文字上幷且應在精神上履行各項條約。第三，准允德人成立其自治政府，無需親共者。第四，停止德境之反美運動。第五，停止恐怖行動諸如綁架及非法逮捕反共德人。第六，表示信任及妥協精神。</p>

<p>〔聯合社巴黎廿九日電〕阿根廷外長勃拉馬格里亞今日稱，蘇聯代表維辛斯基對安理會中立國調解柏林爭端新方案，」表示同意。美英法三國亦已在原則上接受，一俟各該國政府核准明日卽可提出覆文，正式表示同意，屆時卽可着手物色中立國貨幣專家組織委員會，會同四大國專家處理柏秣幣制問題。新方案所擬折衷辦法，可以打開西方國家在蘇聯釗鎖威脅下不進行任何談判之僵局。</p>
<p>〔合衆社巴黎廿九日電〕四强二十九日對安理會主席阿根廷外長勃拉馬格里亞提出之新建議，給予嘗試性之同意，認爲解決柏林通貨問題，係結束柏林封鎖之必要步驟。但據權威方面稱，西方國家認爲勃氏之新建議，不過爲默認中立國調解柏林危機之失敗而已，渠等訊爲柏林局勢已在迅速惡化，在聯合國能執行任何調解之前，柏林可能早已分裂爲二。專家委員會硏究通貨問題，至少需一閱月，渠等認爲：此不過係以前各種建議之新曲折，並無早日解決柏林危機之希望。</p>
<p>〔聯合社巴黎三十日電」阿根廷外長勃拉馬格里亞輪値本月安理會主席將於今日午夜期滿，下月一日由比代表朗琴霍夫繼任主席。勃氏定一日赴義大利，但稱，必要時可以改變行動。</p>

<p>〔合衆社華盛頓卅日電〕政府官員卅日預測，今後一年內，美國將與西方世界大多數國家締結聯防同盟。此項同盟包括里約熱內盧泛美聯防公約，及醞釀中之北大西洋安全協定。國會已於十月間批准里約公約，下月起卽可生效。今年冬季，美國·加拿大及西歐聯盟五國，將各遣代表，集議成立北大西洋協定，美國之參加，又有待於下屆國會之批准。西歐聯盟五國（英··比·荷·盧）已草就成立大西洋約之建議，可望於本週中由五國駐美大使向華盛頓提出。里約及北大西洋兩協定，將使美國有協助保衛全球一大部份之義務。此一「安全地區」在西半球將縱貫南北極然後橫渡大西洋，直達西歐之主要反共國家。在里約公約生效前，美洲十四國應將批准書呈交汎美聯盟。至今已有十三國提出批准書·美國亦在內。第十四國，哥斯達利加，將在下月提呈批准文。根據里約公約，各締約國間任何一國遭遇武裝攻撃，其他國家應一體認爲等於本國受攻擊，而有義務立卽以本國認爲適宜之行動應付攻擊。故在此局面下，依照美國憲法，國會將最後決定應否參戰。</p>

<p>〔合衆社東京三十日電〕日本衆議院在澈夜會議後，於三十日晨通過麥帥授意之修改公務員法法案，該項修正法案將否定公務員之罷工及集體談判權。社會民主然在國會委員會中，發動修正該修正法案之攻勢，以給予公務員若干形式之集體談判權，但委員會卒以十四票對九票通過原修正法案，然後卽由衆院全體大會通過。該項法案已提交上院，預期上院亦可於三十日通過該案。</p>

<p>〔合衆社東京卅日電〕麥帥卅日允許延期執行東條及其他被處絞刑之日本戰犯六人之死刑，雖然，僅廣田及土肥原二人向美國最高法院上訴，但麥帥之聲明中顯示：在美國最高法院未裁定以前，各犯均將暫緩執行，然此點亦尙朱能完全確定。</p>
<p>麥帥在聲明中並未明白說明是否僅允許上訴之二人抑或允許七人全部暫緩執行，但由於上訴中包括之條例對全體適用，故可視爲全部死犯均將暫緩執行。麥帥之驚奇行動，僅在此間接獲廣田及土肥原上訴之非官方消息後數小時發出，麥帥總部發表特種公報稱：「關於報界詢問處死各犯是否將在美國最高法院裁定上訴之前絞決，麥帥明白答稱：不將一如此」。</p>
<p>〔聯合社東京卅日電〕日本侵華禍首土肥原之辯護律師華倫今日宣稱，土肥原及廣田宏毅兩人已向美國最高法院提起上訴。（該院預定本月六日開庭）渠不擬請麥帥暫緩執行，但將以上訴事通知麥帥，若在最高法院裁定前執行，未免太奇。廣田之辯護律師山岡亦稱，渠希望在美國最高法院裁定上訴案前展緩執行。被吿律師認爲此上訴案與山下奉文，本間及德國戰犯案截然不同。被吿質問十一國組織法庭審判日本戰犯之權力，並質問法庭所依據之憲章，美國最高法院應對遠東國際法庭及其憲章之效力加以裁定。</p>
<p>〔合衆社東京卅日電〕麥克阿瑟元帥之發言人艾吉斯上校廿九日指出，土肥原及廣田二人之向美最高法院上訴，幷不東縛盟軍統帥之身份。渠稱：「根據遠東委員會所賦予之權力，麥帥爲最後審査人」，此間盟國諸總部朱曾接獲在華盛頓提出上訴之官方通知。盟總諸律師揣測，美最高法院如認爲需暫停處決，必須請求社魯門總統下令麥帥暫緩處決</p>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓卅日電〕法律界人仕卅日對美國最高法院能否千涉日本戰犯案件，表示若干懷疑·渠等指出，在過去·最高法院曾拒絕廢止戰犯之判決。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕全國慰勞總會第一第二慰勞團全體，在徐州前綫勞軍完畢，業已於日前分返京滬。該團團長張道藩，方治及團員陳伯良。凌英貞等爲報吿此行經過及前方實際情况，昨特假新生活俱樂部招待記者。渠等目先指出根據該團全體觀察結果，認爲國軍在此次徐蚌會戰中已廠得戰略上之勝利。前方士氣空前旺盛，居民情緒更鎭定異常，十一月十七日夜間戰事達於最高潮時，徐州市內可聞淸晰砲聲，但居民操作如故，且城內從未發生搶却騷等情事。尤使人裏心感佩者，爲各街頭每夜均有民衆自動協助軍隊放哨，輪値巡遍，軍民合作之緊密，足顯示前方上下一致有敵無我之殲匪決心。渠等復指出近來京滬一帶官員眷屬領導逃難之現象，政府應迅卽下令制止，此輩平日高官厚俸，急難時一走了事，政府應査封沒收其財產，以安人心。</p>
<p>追述見聞至饒興味</p>
<p>渠等繞娓　追述戡亂部隊中種種見聞，至饒興味：如渠等在魏家河前綫勞軍時，曾晤一名吳一農之士兵，住本市海潮寺街一二四號，竟係前上海師管區內應微之志願兵，另在傷兵醫院又晤一住本市虬江路興國路口二〇七號之馮坤山，彼自稱僅臂部輕傷，托轉語其家人勿念，並謂一俟傷愈卽將重上征塲，暫復此仇。渠等在邱兵團中亦曾發現一年僅十八歲之蒙城女學生張子君，志願投効任剿匪工作，實爲婦女界之好榜樣。尙有邱兵團中曾有一士兵隻身潛入匪陣地內，揚言彼等大隊已被包圍，勸令早降，結果竟說降題軍達卅餘人以上。其他國軍下級軍官設計殲敵，匪軍脫逃來歸等事，在前方已屬婦孺皆知。</p>
<p>最後該團全體更引述匪軍近在會戰中種種新式暴行，謂陷匪各地十六歲至四十五歲之民衆，近均被逼充「爆炸英雄」，其方法卽以五六人列成一隊，手脚相縛，懸手榴彈於其身上，令向國軍陣地衝鋒。渠等席間出示自最前綫攝來之照片，遍地屍體之足臂，果有布條緊紮，匪軍賤視民命，殘酷陰險，令人髪指。再匪軍近給養困難，部隊均以生花生米果腹，每日更須步行百餘里，致怨聲截道，加之徐蚌間劉伯承與陳毅交惡，陳匪前遭我大兵團圍剿，損失約十萬人，渠指摘劉匪不能援助友軍，但劉匪則散發傳單攻擊陳毅係英雄主義，而以同志作犧牲，此項傳單在匪屍身上已屢有發現，足證匪軍陣營裂痕日深，稍經國剿，崩潰僅屬時間問題云。</p>
<p>方治演講聞者動容</p>
<p>慰勞團方兼團長治，昨在招待記者席上演詞：略稱：此次兄弟與張團長偕同京滬各界代表以及新聞界各位朋友，代表京滬同胞赴徐州前綫慰勞，可說已盡了最大的努力。我們帶去的是後方同胞寄與前方將士的一股溫暖的熟情，我們帶回的是前綫將士報答後方同胞的一副堅强的鬥志。前方將士沒有辜負後方同胞的委託，同時，也希望後方同胞，不要辜負前方將士的一片苦心云。方氏並對徐州市况，慰勞情形，士兵中可歌可泣之壯烈事蹟，以及共匪殘酷的慘象，加以申述，聞者無不動容。</p>

<h3 id="c83">徐州戰事勝利評價　上接一版 <a href="#c83" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e83" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">83</a></h3>
<p>勝利代價　後方一般人民，對於這次徐州會戰的戰果，頗表關切。記者在前方多方調査的結果，可以大膽的說，陳毅所部在這次會戰中的眞正損失，約在十三萬至十五萬人之間，碾莊一仗是標準的硬仗，雙方激戰了十三個晝夜，黃兵團所部五個軍，都是精銳，擁有一百門大砲的火力；陳毅所部採取攻勢，所以傷亡特別大。徐西徐南的戰事，是國軍穩打穩紮的步步推進，雙方的損失均有限。前方的忠勇將士，爲了屛陣江淮，在這次大戰中亦付出了近十萬人的代價。黃百韜兵團是這次決戰中的眞正英雄，在碾莊彈丸之地，和佔絕對優勢的敵人苦鬥，對方根據在東北的經騐，日夜用造謠和誘惑的廣播，來動搖國軍戰士的鬥志，可是證明全無用處。經過十三日夜的苦戰，畢竟挽回馮治安部叛變後的全局，最後突圍與援軍會師。不過，他們的犧牲亦是慘重的，原來五軍之衆，突圍而出的不過五六個團而已，餘均壯烈殉國，其餘的國軍部隊，像邱兵團。李兵團。孫兵團等，在進次會戰中，都是士氣昂揚，達成任務。徐州東南部空軍基地的防衛，就是由邱兵團內的七十四軍防衛的，在勝利的擊退敵方的攻勢後，還能織續向前迫擊。空軍基地在徐州只有一個，若有差失，大事全去。而對方此次攻徐的部署中，就安排定首先要消滅黃兵團，使徐州東翼空虛；奪取空軍基地，使徐州對外隔絕，然後集中全力對付邱兵團，奪取這座華東重鎭·結果，他們的計劃兩處碰壁，勝利遂屬於國軍。</p>
<p>自然，勝利的最大光榮應閱於實際戰鬥的士兵；但是指揮官的素質和將才，亦是決定的因素。徐州剿總的總司令是劉峙將軍，這次以必死的決心，坐鎭危城，十幾夜未曾安眠，在他激厲之下，軍長等高級畏官，均親至前方督戰，致國軍士氣之旺盛，爲過去任何一次戰役所未有。而運籌帷幄指揮若定的，還是副總司令杜聿明將軍。杜將軍是徐局緊急後，最高當局直接委任的，剿總有許多位副總司令但是沒有實權，杜韋明的官衛是「作戰副總司令」，表示這位副座是有指揮作織的大權的。杜氏是極有才幹的名將，且深得當局信任，在相當的範國內，可以當機立斷，在軍事佈置上改變當局的決定。原來聲個徐州大戰的調動佈置，還得請示南京，總統府在各軍內派有視察官，搜集當地的軍情和贊料，向南京提出報吿和建議。杜聿明在這次徐州東翼情勢危急時，曾以很大的果斷，在西翼冒險撤兵，縮短防綫，在三十六小時之內，將邱李兩兵團的主力，轉移到東綫，穩定了動慢的局勢。就事論事，如果前方的指揮官能够在其原則之下放心做事，不必事事請示，而致失去時機，則縱然今天的局面已是支離破碎，前途還是有挽回希望的。</p>
<p>有利影響　徐州大會戰已吿結束，現在戰局重心南移，津浦路交通綫之是否能恢復，就看宿縣蚌埠間戰事的演變。如果平心靜氣的衡量這次勝利的價値，不難發現有下列幾點：（一）打擊了對方的士氣和恢復了國軍的信心，因爲經過了山東和東北的覆軍後，對方已把國軍的作戰能力和士氣估得很低，在戰略上相當的放棄穩打穩紮的作風，竟想一舉而下徐蚌，進一步威脅京滬解決全局。現在經此一挫，信心必然减弱，冒險的行動勢將减少。在國軍方面言，近歡月來到處退却之聲，確是影響士氣，現在經此一捷，軍心重振，作者敢負責斷言，在徐州四週各兵團的士氣，都是十分旺盛，只要把普通士兵的生活待遇積極改善，現在和將來都是國家的長城。這裏願特別强調一點，就是不能把共匪的傷亡過於重視，因爲他們控制有大量的民兵，補充比國軍容易，同時他們所使用的非正規的戰略，不需士兵受長期的訓練。道次的勝利雖使對方受到慘重的損失，但並沒有消滅他們政工人員控制部隊和士兵的能力，不久定會捲土重來。（二）影響美國對華心理，在徐州會戰爆發之初，美國大使館的軍事參贊曾至徐旅行，其性質不問可知。同時隨南京慰勞團俱來的，尙有七位美國同業，他們探問軍情，無微不至，並親至最前綫觀戰。你能相信這位可尊敬的同業，在實質上不是美國國務院的在華觀察員嗎？據記者所知，徐戰結束之前，在華的美箱人士什九對國軍缺乏信念，訊爲徐州之捷僅僅是一種宣傳，實際上並沒有發生大規模的戰爭，現在身臨戰塲，看到國軍的一切活動，觀念爲之一變。目前的情勢是信任國軍力能支撑大局，實是美國軍專援華的前提，徐州大會戰的成就，從這個角度去看是十分重要的。（三）證明國軍新戰略的成功，過去國軍爲威信關係，名城大邑，在所必守，結果是兵力分散，處處陷於劣勢和被動，一年以前，人負與物質的消耗極大，養成了對方目前的優勢·這種死守的戰略，至藩長棄守而破產，國軍在新的觀念之下作戰，重在擊敵主力而不爭一城一池之得失。道次徐州之捷，就是放棄汴鄭，集中精銳的結果。同樣的，徐州戰事重心南移後，陳毅·劉伯承主力結集於宿。蚌之間，山東和河南的後方十分空虛，國軍不乘虛北進，規復鄭汴和魯南，而積極調集主力南下參戰，亦是基於同一的理由。蚌埠接近京師，供應比徐州更方便，在南北國軍夾擊之下，我們有理由相信津浦路南段（徐浦段）將於短期內重通。</p>

<p>據輸出入管理委員會消息；進出口貿易實施聯鎖後，該會已表示對原有之輸入限額，仍照常分配，不予减少。惟鋻於過去所有進口之限額，因限於外匯支出關係，數量頗少，但受分配之廠商過多，按照比率分配後，每一廠商僅能配得少許，此項少許進口之原料，致使大廠商無法利用。現該會已決定改革限額分配辦法，放棄普遍分配政策，採取重點分配制，俾所有進口限額，得以集中使用，亦卽積極扶持工商業，將所有進口限額，集中分配與重要廠商黨量利用，此種分配辦法，將較過去之普遍分配辦法，改進甚多云。</p>

<p>— 本報特約記者　智基</p>
<p>〔本報香港廿八日航訊〕倫敦廿五日電稱：英殖民地大臣瓊斯在國會答覆某議員質問時稱：對香港中共之活動已在密切注視中，並謂對於共黨欲利用香港作爲反抗友邦政府之活動基地，正準備將其驅逐出境。此間國民日報透露：本港官方人士對瓊斯此項聲明，雖拒絕批評，但據權咸界消息稱：港當局對於匿港之反友邦政府之叛逆份子，曾直接及間接予以警吿，囑以檢束行動，愼勿有越過其政治難民身份之活動。該方面並指出英政府公開承認共黨在港活動，實以此爲第一次。　以府毅然有此堅決行動之準備，或由於港督葛量洪爵士出席星洲會議歸來之結果。官方雖聲明此爲例行之會議，但各方面之報道，均揭露該會議係商討防共問題，特別注重共黨在港之活動情形。此間觀察家僉認爲港當局今後對共黨之態度，最低限度將恢復戰前之政策。</p>
<p>共黨活動驅逐出港</p>
<p>上項電訊發表後，港中各報（二）六日普遍刋出，爲了英官方正式表示「正在嚴密注視中共在香港的活動和進行把幾名共黨遞解出境」港中具有政治色彩的報紙，廿七日都以港聞版第一條新聞　地位刋出各該報記者訪問港府　關當局的報道，而香港原有三人報紙，工商·華僑·星島·則完全置身局外，不予探討。</p>
<p>反華活動决不容忍</p>
<p>此間「新生晚報」對此問題時探討，最爲詳盡，所引述港府發言人與警察局長的談話亦至詳細，但港府對進行　解出境的幾名共黨人員，不願有所披露，但稱：可能把他們解回中共區域內新生晚報載稱：港警察總監麥景陶表示：對於上述電訊裏說的將　解出境的幾個共黨人員，麥景陶不肯說出他們的名字或被逐日期，當記者詢以他對於此事當然已有全盤瞭解，只不過要保守秘密罷了，麥景陶微笑說：「是這樣的。</p>
<p>被驅人名未予透露</p>
<p>港府新聞處長郝戈登對於這件事則有比較詳細的解釋。他對該報記者說：香港當局並不欲參預中國國共雙方的事情，但也不能允許有人在香港破壞任何友邦政府。是以中共人員倘若有利用香港作爲反中國政府基地的行動將不被許可，因爲國民政府是英國目前所承認了的政權。倘若國民黨利用香港反對蘇聯也在被禁之列，因爲蘇聯政府也已爲英國所承認。</p>
<p>他說：「香港不能被中共用作反政府基地是爲了免得使香港陷入困難。」</p>
<p>關於上述電訊裏所說的將被遞解出境的中共人員案件詳情，郝戈登也拒絕透露任何消息，但是他强調說他們的被遞解只是由於特殊事件。他答覆記者的詢問說，遞解將由警員執行，送回中國地區。</p>

<h3 id="c104">共產主義在中國　一九四八年九月　美國眾院我瞄準鏡委員會編撰 <a href="#c104" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e104" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">104</a></h3>
<p>— 本報編譯室特譯</p>
<p>這篇報吿書是美國衆院外　委員會民族及國際運動小組委員會編撰的「世界共產主議的戰略與戰術」報吿中補編三「各國硏究」的第三編，對中國共產主義的起源，特徵，歷史背景，發嚴過程，對蘇聯的關係，美國的能態度，和中國對世界的重要性等等、根據實際的材料，作詳盡的，客觀的叙述和分析。原文發表於本年九月間，關於我最近改革幣制事亦曾提及，足證其取材的新穎。</p>
<p>本報吿書論及中共發展的歷史和社會背景時，指出一個農業國家的內戰和國際戰爭狀態，直接間接都與共產主義有利，但强調中國是能保持文化獨立的唯一大國，不能被任何外來的勢力所征服，亦不能被分裂。報吿中變毛澤東的「新民主主義」從各種角度去批判它，並說明它不能適用於中國的前因後果。報吿涉及中共最近的發展時，承認它勢力的擴張，如果打勝內戰，可能使全國赤化。但指出中共本身的種種弱點，如果世人肯努力，有決心，中共的最後成功，未始不可以遏阻的。最後力陳中國在世界問題中的重要性及與仳界和戰命運的關繋，主張夫國必須和中國合作，給予中國以軍事上，經濟上和政治上的援助。</p>
<p>國內局勢已演變到緊急關頭，蔣夫人正飛美作援華呼翻，同時白宮方面亦正密切注意我國局勢之發展，以便決定援華方針。此項報吿曾經美衆議員周以德及其他中國問題專家審閱並發表意見及批評，殊有供參攷之價値，爰特將全文各章，按照內容之重要次要，分別全譯或節譯，逐日在本報刋登。全文計分五章如下：（一）中國與共產主義；（二）中國共產主義的誕生與成長；（三）第二次統一戰綫；（四）第二次內戰；（五）中國的重要性。</p>
<p>（一）　序言</p>
<p>一，中國共產主義是正規的共產主義。它的學說遵循列寗和史達林的學說。它的領袖是受莫期科訓練的。它的政策和行動，它的戰略和戰術，都是共產黨型的。三十餘年來中國共產黨忠實地迫隨了克林姆宮路棧的每一曲折。</p>
<p>關於中國共產主義的性質和眞義，在美國所引起的辯論，較多於世界上莫他各國的共產主義。辯論發生於學者和批評家中問，而反映在輿論和美國政府的政策裏。但是時至今日已經證據確鋻，母庸繼續辯論了。</p>
<p>二，中國本身是全世界的人類文化中心之一，已有三千年歷史。中國是一個龐大的國家，它的高深的文化使它强盛起來，能够征服它的鄰國，併吞它的短時期的征服者。它是從未被西方政治所吞沒的唯一大國。中國今日遭遇西方科學和工業兩種力量的衝撃，並非像歐洲在文藝復興以後四百年中漸漸地接受的，而是突然的，一旦的。以往的中國政治，與其說是像現代西方國家的政治，不如說像中古時代的政治。中國未曾經過幾百年的憲政和立法的準備，就被迫試行現代民主政治。中國至今還沒有享受到現代國家的和平。</p>
<p>三，共產主義在蘇俄革命以後不久，初次出現於中國。不久以後，共產國際顧問跟踵而來，開始把共產主義灌輸到中國來，，並使之適應這個非工業國家的情形。從那時起，中國共產主義的歷史可分成下列四個時期或階段：</p>
<p>一九二三年至二七年—第一次統一戰綫時期。</p>
<p>一九二七年至三七年—第一次內戰時期。</p>
<p>一九三七年至四六年—第二次統一戰綫時期。</p>
<p>一九四六年至……—第二次內戰時期。</p>
<p>四，中國曾被作爲現代列寗派共產主義發展的試騐塲所。自從蘇俄革命以後，共產主義面對着兩個世界：在一方面—西方，是主要的工業國家、馬克斯的「資本論」被用作它們的一種診斷和一種預言。在這些國家中，德國曾被認爲推行共產主義機會最好的一個國家，在希特勒時代以前，德國共產黨被列爲蘇聯以外各國共產黨的前輩。在另一方面—東方和南方，在亞洲，非洲和南非洲的大部份陸地上，住着佔全世界人口四分之三的居民。這些民族大部工業蔣後，敎育低洛，資源貧乏，政治幼稚的。克林姆宮漸漸注意到這些國家，在它們裏面發見了許多機會很好的　　·　一九一七年在蘇聯國內一樣，這些國家缺乏歷史悠久基礎確立的民主制度、較之西方的工業發達的國家，更適宜於推行共產主義。共產黨爲了滲入這全世界四分之三的人口中去，中國遂被用作了實驗室和試騐塲听。中國共產黨在這第二個世界中，保持了克林姆宮的長女的地位。</p>
<p>五，共產主義在中國自始卽已利用着國民愛國心的澎湃和反帝國主義運動。同時，中國初期的共產黨更佔着這最先的便宜，卽中國初期的國家主義運動並無前例或過去經騐，可資判斷和共產黨合作的結果如何。直到一九二七年共產黨限見中國的勝利和團結已趨穩定，因而暴露了他們赤化中國的意向以後，中國國民黨纔和他們絕交，於是便開始了第一次內戰。</p>
<p>六，在第一次內戰的十年中間，共產黨集結在一個區域裏，建立了一個蘇維埃系統，對國軍的屢次進攻發動慘烈的保衛戰。最後，在一九三五年他們遷移到西北的陜西省，奪得了一個地區而建立了一種政府。</p>
<p>七，當希特勒氣燄高漲，日本意存侵略，莫斯柯急於欲使日本有事於中國的時候，便形成了第二次的「統一戰綫」。中國共產黨使用其虛僞愛國宣傳的慣技，一再要求恢復全國統一戰綫，以抵抗日本的侵略。一九三七年蔣介石被迫接受此二次統一戰綫的要求，開始了八年戰爭，把中國的實力全部消耗而予共產黨以休養生息的機會。</p>
<p>八，第二次統一戰綫時期共產黨的理論和宣傳方針，刋載於一九四〇年出版的毛澤東所著「中國的新民主主義」小册子里。這本小册子的刋行有兩種目的：第一，向中國共產黨明白解釋怎樣保持爭取獨裁機的運動；第二，把宣傳的故事用巧妙的文字加以渲染，使愛國者看了認爲是愛國的，中和份子看了認爲是中和的，同時自由份子看了也認爲是自由的。因爲任何高明的共產黨負都知道「民主」二字用在共產黨的公文裏面時其意卽指無產階級專政，而大多數的自由份子並不知道這個秘密，所以這一件語妙雙關的把戲並不像你所想像的那樣困難。雖然寫這本小冊子時代已經過去，共產黨却已好多年利用它作爲極有效的宣傳工具。</p>
<p>九，第二次統一戰綫直到第二次內戰的開始纔正式終止，但在此以前有一個很重要的過渡時期。蘇聯參加遠東方面的戰爭，做到了以前所不可能的一件事，那便是蘇聯的大規模干涉中國局勢。國民政府軍隊佔領華北及東北以後，因受到運輸困難和共產黨及蘇聯干涉的雙重壓力而吿摧毀，同時日軍賸下來的武器多少隱秘地流入中共的手裏。當美國放棄其調停中國內戰並（錯誤地）勸誘國民政府接受與共產黨合組聯合政府的辦法時，共產黨便凖備以數倍於昔日的資源重新發動內戰。這樣蘇聯便可以戰時盟友的姿態而移入，很快的推翻中國軍隊的均勢，然後再退出去，重新對美發動徘外和反帝國主義的宣傳攻勢。</p>
<p>十，共產主義在中國已經佔到許多便宜或優勢。它隨時可以利用突發的國家主義運動。至少在一九二六年以後，它曾利用了戰亂的機會。在一九二七年以後，它已能控制土地而不需負担任何國民的責任。它自行組織紅軍。這種種條件使中國共產主義的策略和政策適合於一切的經濟和政治問題。它對於土地問題的處理說明了它在這些條件下「解決」問題的似是而非的主張。共產黨的控制任何鄕村區域必然把鄕間和城市切斷，把富有農民的士地給予貧苦的農民，因此很容易取得這輩貧苦農民的信心，而不致發生生產减少的後果。他們無須應付整個問題，因爲他們直到現在爲止僅僅掠奪或破壞城市和機器。他們無須對中國政府負實際責任，却靠了戰爭和破壞的狀態以給養自身。</p>
<p>十一，中國共產主義有其優勢，也有其弱點。二十年來它沒有方法獲取中國城市的廣大的支援。它對於鄕村的經濟貧困一向實行不負責任的經濟辦法，這些辦法的不恰當已很明顯。國民政府的堅決拒絕與共產黨携手，以及東歐共產黨所遭遇的困難，到底揚去了它的「新民主主義」的假面具而露出了赤色獨裁的企圖的本來面目。但是最緊要的是：中國的問題決不是蘇聯布爾雪維克所用的方法所能處理的。由於沒有機會開拓廣大的土地，人口問題限制了經濟的和政治的手段，在這限制的範圍以內共產黨不能有所作爲。這固然並不能阻止他們爭取權勢，可是他們必須付出驚人的代價才能獲得。</p>
<p>十二，美國的調停是以民主主義與共產主義可以互相調和的假定爲根據的，這是企圖建立第二次世界大戰以後中國聯合政府的努力的基礎。同時另外有一種假定，卽「民主」一語被共產黨應用時的意義，和被我們應用時的意義是相同的。在波蘭·羅馬尼亞·勾牙利和捷克各國，「民主」二字已被拆穿爲冒充「無產階級專政」的幌子。以「新民主主義」爲掩護的聯合政府不過使奪取政權的工作皎爲容易而已。但是在沒有看淸這一點以前，美國竭力擊助中國成立聯合政府，出力之大，史無前例。從那時起，許多國家曾試行共產黨參加聯合內閣的制度；結果有的是共產黨專政，有的是共產黨被排擠出去。中國政府拒絕接受共產黨的條件，此舉顯然是不錯的。</p>
<p>十三，有許多迹象可以說明中國自有其潛在的資源，中國可藉此以得救。城市的堅拒共產勢力姑置不論，晏陽隊初和胡適所提倡的識字運動和地方經濟及社會改革運動，和其他許多嘗試性的運動，已經開拓了一條喚起並發揚民衆活動力的正路。傅作義將軍最近在北平的努力，證明了這些思想的若千部分已被應用到實際的計劃裏去，而得到了很有希望的成果。</p>
<p>十四，無論對於世界共產主義或民主及和平勢力，中國是世界十五億人民開展並試騐其前進路綫的試騐塲所。需待解決的問題有工藝和工業問題。經濟問題·社會問題·國內治安問題和國外政治安全問題，最後是怎樣變成眞正的民主政治的問題。中國如果沒有援助，不能解決它的經濟問題。中國如果沒有軍事援助，不能解決因蘇聯援助中共煽動內亂而引起的國內治安問題。而且中國沒有美國和聯合國的支持，也不能享有國外的政治安全。三十餘年來中國共產黨和國際共產黨始終合作着，尋求使中國成爲共產黨獨裁國家的方法。如欲解決怎樣使中國成爲現代民主國家的問題，最好是由中國和美國合力來解決。中國的命運最後將決定東南亞和全世界的命運。</p>
<p>一　中國與共產主義</p>
<p>甲　是共產黨型的還是中國型的？</p>
<p>全世界無論那一國的共產主義，在某種意義上是該美國所特有的。無論那一國的共產黨大都是本國人，他們說本國話，看本國報紙，過本國生活，吃本國菜，玩本國遊戲。中國共產黨是中國型的，中國共產主義是中國型的</p>
<p>無論那一國的共產主義，也還是共產主義。無論那一國的叵回敎之爲回回敎的，其意義是顯而易見，盡人皆知的。同樣，無論那一國的美以美敎會是美以美敎派的，無論那一國的羅馬法也還是羅馬法，化學是化學。要之，凡是一國以上的人對生活所共通而超越某一國特性的事物，都是普通的事物。它們出於同一來源，它們能持續數十年或數百年而不衰，是靠了册籍的保存，再經過傳授而推陳出新。靠它們生活的人們都學習過它們，更輾轉流傳給他人。因此，中國共產黨是中國人，也是共產黨。他們的領袖沾染馬克思，列寗和史達林的思想。他們熟諳莫斯科對現代文化的分析，共產黨的未來戰略的　測，和指導各地共產黨採取目前行竄的命令。</p>
<p>若干年來，共產黨訓練的最重要的一個考騐是追隨全世界的共黨路綫的每一曲折。這一種考騐把共產主義的叛徒和忠實信徒加以判別出來。目前的共產黨領袖大都經過道一種考騐而選拔出來的。當一九三五年共產國際採取人民陣綫的路綫時，中國共產黨也就跟從這一條路綫。自一九三七年至一九三九年間莫斯科支持中國國民政府反抗日本，中共參加統一戰綫，忠實地盡了中國的本分。自一九三九年至一九四一年間，莫斯科指歐洲的戰爭爲帝國主義戰爭而採取了孤立主義者的態度，同時中共也就放鬆了對日抗戰而加强其奪取政權的活動。在一九四一年六月廿二日以後，同時在莫斯科和延安，帝國主義的戰爭一變而爲爭取自由與民主的戰爭。之後，中共恢復其爭取中國政權的攻勢。一九四五年蘇聯和中國簽訂友好協定時，中共總算安靜了幾個月，到一九四六年看到美國暫時不致皮持中國政府時，中共立卽公然發動內戰。全世界的共產黨沒有再比中國共產黨有着更優越的地位了。</p>

<h3 id="e1">Favorable Developments in the Bengbu-Suzhou Battle; Nationalist Troops Advancing Northward Reached Guzhen Yesterday; Armored Corps Captured Liuzhuang Southeast of Xuzhou <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 28th] According to reports received here tonight from relevant sources, the Nationalist troops advancing north along the Jinpu Railway have recaptured Guzhen tonight, but this news has not been officially announced by the military.</p>
<p>[Our Bengbu Dispatch on the 30th] The Bengbu-Suzhou battle is still developing under the active initiative of the Nationalist forces. Although the prelude to the battle has begun, it has not yet reached the stage of fierce fighting. According to military estimates, the Communist bandits are moving south with a force of about 200,000. Most of the main force, under the close pressure of the Sun, Qiu, and Li three army corps advancing south from Xuzhou, is now massing on both sides of the Hui River west of the Jinpu Railway. A part, about 40,000, has crossed the Xie River (between the Hui River and the North Fei River) and is moving towards Huaiyuan. Another force of about 5,000 is heading towards Cao Lao Ji. Last night, more than 200 scattered bandits infiltrated west of Cao Lao Ji and were completely annihilated by Nationalist forces. The Nationalist forces, based on their original plan, have completed their deployment on the banks of the North Fei River, so the Communist bandits' gradual southward movement is likely to get bogged down and be unable to extricate themselves.</p>
<p>[Our Bengbu Dispatch on the 30th] (1) Liu Zhi flew to the front line by special plane yesterday afternoon to inspect. (2) The Air Force, in coordination with ground troops on the 29th, killed more than 10,000 bandits in the Xinqiao front. (3) The curfew time in Bengbu will be moved forward by half an hour from today, starting at 9:00 PM.</p>
<p>[Our Bengbu Dispatch on the 30th] Southbound trains from here are still running as usual today, but northbound trains have been suspended.</p>
<p>[United Press Nanjing Dispatch on the 30th] The government officially denied rumors of ordering the withdrawal from Xuzhou on the 30th, while semi-official sources admitted that the main battle area in northern Jiangsu is gradually moving south. Bengbu has now become the focus of the war, with the one-eyed general Liu Bocheng in the west and Chen Yi in the east. The vanguard of the Communist offensive continues to move south. The rumor of ordering the withdrawal from Xuzhou was apparently caused by the announcement that the Xuzhou Pacification Headquarters, led by Commander-in-Chief Liu Zhi, had moved to Bengbu, and by the advance of two army corps to the south.</p>
<p>[Our Xuzhou Dispatch on the 30th] The armored units, in coordination with the Qiu Army Corps, defeated the Zhongnan (i.e., the 16th) Column of the East Shandong Military Region, 12 kilometers southeast of Xuzhou at Liutang River, and continued to capture Liuzhuang, 50 li southeast of Xuzhou. In this battle, they seized 20 heavy machine guns, 30 light machine guns, and over 500 rifles, killed over 3,000 bandits, and captured over 300 bandits.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 30th] Lieutenant Colonel Jiang Weiguo, Chief of Staff of the Armored Forces Command, accompanied by Chen Shoucheng, Director of the Political Warfare Department, flew to Xuzhou by special plane at 10:00 AM on the 30th, bringing a large number of comfort items to express sympathy to the officers and soldiers of the armored units participating in the Battle of Xuzhou.</p>

<p>[United Press Peiping Dispatch on the 30th] According to official reports today, Nationalist troops recaptured Baotou this morning, greatly stabilizing the situation in Suiyuan.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency Zhangjiakou Dispatch on the 30th] It is reported that the Nie bandit's 1st, 2nd, 4th, and 64th columns have fled from Sui territory to Yuxian and Zhuolu in southern Chahar, and Guangling in northern Shanxi. A military expert told reporters that the bandits' flight to the Zanhuabao area southwest of Yuxian and Zhuolu is intended to coordinate with the battles in eastern Hebei and cut off the Ping-Zhang transportation, isolating Peiping and Tianjin. The military expert further stated that the national military focus is currently a struggle of containment by the bandits in central and northern China.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency Taiyuan Dispatch on the 30th] Fierce fighting continues in the western mountain area of Taiyuan. A part of the bandit's 5th Brigade, facing Huaritou about 40 li west of the city, launched another fierce attack on our positions on the morning of the 30th. The defending troops resolutely resisted, and the positions remained secure. Fighting continued with the bandits until evening. Another part of the bandit's New 4th Brigade launched a fierce attack on the high ground west of Shagouliang. After a fierce battle until about 3:00 PM, our reinforcements arrived and launched an attack from both inside and outside, inflicting heavy losses on the bandits, who fled in a hurry to the northwest area of Shagouliang. According to preliminary statistics, over 1,000 bandits were killed or wounded in both areas today.</p>
<p>[Our Tianjin Dispatch on the 30th] There are no signs of major battles in eastern Hebei, but the situation of the Communist bandits' flight is extremely concerning. Luanxian and Zhazitou, Leizhuang, and other places to the west have been occupied by bandits on the 30th. However, the Luoyang Bridge was destroyed by Nationalist troops on the 28th, rendering it unusable for the bandits. Nationalist troops have now completed a tight deployment in the Gu Ye mining area. In addition, personnel evacuated from Qinyu have been arriving in Tianjin successively on the 30th.</p>
<p>[Our Tangshan Dispatch on the 30th] It is reported that Lin Biao's 9th Column, with over 10,000 troops, is in Qian'an; Hu Yi's unit, with 4,000, is in Yutian; Zeng Yongya's unit, with 5,000, is in Pinggu; and the 7th Column, with 4,000, is in Sanhe. In addition, bandit units in Ganmingshan, Tongxian, and Malanyu, Xinglong, are mostly building air defense positions. Another bandit army's 2nd Battalion, with more than ten Japanese-style tanks, infiltrated Tongxian from Lengkou on the 26th. In addition to the daily reconnaissance and bombing by iron wing units, the Nationalist troops on the Ping-Gu Road are coordinating with the anti-bandit forces in eastern Hebei, conducting mobile searches and suppression along the Qian-Gan River.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency Peiping Dispatch on the 30th] The infantry and cavalry units searching and suppressing eastward in Pingdong, after clearing the remaining bandits along the line from Xiangfutou, Xuzhaolin, and Dazhaolin (east of Qukouzhen and west of Sanhe) on the afternoon of the 29th, have approached the vicinity of Sanhe. In the vast area within the arc of Xianghe, Sanhe, and Baodi, about 200 li long, there is no trace of bandits.</p>

<p>Full Recovery Still Requires Eight or Nine Days</p>
<p>[Our Report] President Sun is still staying at the Sino-Belgian Zhen Ding Hospital for treatment. Many people from all walks of life, such as Wu Tiecheng and Liu Weizhi, sent many flowers. However, Mr. Sun followed the doctor's advice and did not receive any visitors other than family members in order to recover as soon as possible and go to Nanjing to form a cabinet. Yesterday, a reporter visited Dr. Lin Dawei, who performed the surgery on Mr. Sun. According to reports, the tumor on Mr. Sun's left upper thigh was operated on this Monday. Starting at 9:00 AM that morning, a half-body local anesthesia was administered, and the surgery was successfully performed to remove the tumor, which took a total of one hour. The removed tumor was quite large, weighing two pounds. This time, a rapid surgery was adopted to reduce the patient's pain, lower the temperature as soon as possible, and quickly close the wound. Therefore, Mr. Sun was able to get out of bed and walk the day after the surgery. However, since the wound area after the tumor removal is quite large, it still requires several days of rest before a complete recovery can be achieved. It is estimated that it will take about eight or nine days. Currently, Mr. Sun's mental and physical condition are very normal, except for slightly high blood pressure. In addition to him presiding over the surgery, Dr. Wu Huanxing assisted from the side, and Dr. Shen Kefei participated in the discussion of the surgery.</p>
<p>It is also learned that Dr. Mo Dawei is a Chinese overseas from Montreal, Canada, originally from Xinhui, Guangdong. He is 33 years old this year and holds a Doctor of Medicine degree from McGill University in Canada, specializing in surgery. He returned to China for the first time only a year ago. Mr. Lin has a lot of experience in surgery. During his stay in Canada, he had particularly rich clinical experience in the latest open-chest and brain surgeries.</p>

<p>[Central News Agency Washington Dispatch on the 29th] The State Department announced today that Madame Chiang has received an invitation from Mr. and Mrs. Marshall to be their guest at the Marshall's residence in Leesburg, Virginia. A State Department spokesman said, "Madame Chiang received the above invitation from Mr. and Mrs. Marshall when she arrived in Hawaii and has indicated her willingness to accept it. The State Department has sent Protocol Officer Muir to San Francisco to meet Madame Chiang. Madame will arrive in San Francisco by plane from Hawaii at noon on the 30th and then transfer to President Truman's former plane, the 'Sacred Cow,' to Washington, arriving in Washington at 10:00 AM on December 1st (Washington time).

Connally agreed to send more U.S. officers to train new Chinese troops. He said he would discuss future policies with Marshall. Connally said Chiang should go to the front to boost morale. At the same time, Bloom, the future chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, told a Central News Agency reporter that he personally wished to hear Madame Chiang's views because Madame Chiang was familiar with the situation in China. However, the House Foreign Affairs Committee has no plans to meet so far unless the current chairman of the committee, Republican Congressman Michener, calls for it. Bloom called Madame Chiang a wise and astute woman. He said that he would ask Madame Chiang everything to satisfy what he wanted to know. He supported immediate aid to China but did not want the United States to be involved in the war in China. He said that every effort should be made for President Chiang to win the war.</p>

I am also one of those suspected by the outside world of running for the position, which is not true. As a party member, I have always regarded obeying the party's decisions as my duty. I ran for Vice President before based on this purpose. Since taking office, I have been conscientious and diligent. I have no desire to run for further advancement. There is no shortage of friendly colleagues in the Legislative Yuan who have worked together for many years and should understand my aspirations and not easily believe the general speculation in the outside world.</p>

<h3 id="e18">Evaluation of Victory in the Xuzhou Campaign <a href="#e18" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c18" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">18</a></h3>
<p>— Our Reporter Ding Weidong</p>
<p>The severe military crisis that threatened Xuzhou for the past twenty days has now vanished like a nightmare. Of course, before the battles of Bengbu and Suxian come to a conclusion, the decisive battle east of Xuzhou cannot be said to have completely changed the war situation in Central China, but it has at least bought a precious month or two, allowing the military authorities to calmly deploy and reverse the almost irreparable decline after the fall of Jinan and the Northeast. At the same time, military and political personnel here and Chinese and foreign reporters who came to Xuzhou to observe the battle unanimously agreed that the greatest significance of this victory is the re-establishment of the confidence and morale of the National Army.</p>
<p>Factors of Victory</p>
<p>From the enemy's point of view, the Xuzhou Campaign was the product of excessive self-confidence. Because the communists wanted to make a desperate gamble and achieve success once and for all. The number of troops they mobilized was also unprecedented. The highest guiding principle of the communist forces' operations was to not easily engage with the main force of the National Army. Even if they fought a hard battle, it was a so-called "local decisive battle," unwilling to make a desperate gamble. However, this time the situation was completely different. Chen Yi and Liu Bocheng launched all their strength from Shandong, Henan, Anhui provinces with a great advantage, and pounced on this famous city in East China. According to official estimates, the total force used by Liu and Chen was about 600,000 men, of which 80% were Chen Yi's troops, which was the main force that engaged in a decisive battle with the National Army's Huang Baitao in Nianzhuang. The strength of Liu Bocheng's five columns was responsible for containing the National Army on the southern line of the Tianjin-Pukou Railway. Although Chen Yi was the main body of the force and his combat effectiveness was superior, Liu Bocheng was responsible for the overall command. According to General Du Yuming's explanation, Chen Yi is probably a rising star among the communists, and in terms of qualifications, he is far below Liu. At the same time, the latter's cunning tactics are also well known to the National Army.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the National Army's forces facing this major offensive were in an inferior position. In this theater of war, the National Army could use about six army corps (Huang Baitao, Qiu Qingquan, Li Mi, Sun Yuanliang, Li Yannian, and Huang Wei), but because the communist forces were the main attackers and the National Army was the main defender, in a vast theater of war, they inevitably had to spread their forces thinly. It is estimated that the National Army's forces on the eastern and western lines of Xuzhou were only 300,000 men, which was in an unfavorable position in terms of numbers. The tools the National Army relied on to win were, first, several extremely elite army corps, whose equipment and training were unmatched by the communist troops inside the pass. After Chen Yi's troops achieved victory in Jinan, they obtained a lot of heavy equipment, which they used to attack the periphery of Xuzhou. Chen Yi's troops were the most powerful communist army inside the pass, but if compared with the National Army's Qiu Qingquan Corps, there was still a big gap. The Qiu Corps had more than a thousand cannons of various calibers, while the main force of Chen Yi's troops attacking the Huang Corps used only about 200 cannons, a ratio of five to one in firepower. The second is the tank unit. In this major battle, what the communist forces feared most was the activity of the National Army's tanks. It is a pity that the tanks currently used by the National Army are still light tanks received from the Myanmar-India battlefield. They have not been replenished in recent years, and at the same time, they are urgently needed in various battlefields, and their strength is greatly dispersed. American friends estimate that the number of tanks used by the National Army on the Xuzhou battlefield is about 60, but in reality, it is far below this number. However, although the number is small, officials and soldiers alike admit that it reduces casualties during attacks. Just looking at the fact that after the peripheral battles of Xuzhou came to an end, Chiang Wei-kuo, Chief of Staff of the Armored Forces Headquarters, was ordered to go to Taiwan to prepare for the establishment of a tank training school, it can be seen that the importance of the armored forces in the war has made a deep impression on the central government. Another factor of victory for the National Army is the Air Force, which must include both combat and supply aspects. It is worth mentioning that the latter's contribution may be even more important than the former. The threat of the Air Force to the other side's ground forces, according to the opinions of the front-line National Army, may be limited by the number of aircraft, and its effect is not as great as the people in the rear imagine. For example, in terms of bombing, many villages on the periphery of Xuzhou have now become scorched earth, which can be seen clearly when the plane passes over the sky. However, according to the soldiers of the National Army, the communist forces now defend the villages by defending the surroundings but not the center, and the air-raid shelters are dug very effectively, so the casualties caused by air raids are not very large. However, this time, the National Army cooperated well with the Air Force. The ground forces were equipped with air-to-ground speakers to communicate with the Air Force at any time and jointly attack the enemy's strongholds. The artillery also exerted the advantages of precise shooting due to the Air Force's guidance. This advantage contributed greatly to the victory of the National Army. It is no wonder that the communist forces declared that if they captured the Air Force and artillery of the National Army, they would retaliate with inhumane punishments. The Air Force's supply troops can be described as silent, unnamed heroes in this major battle, but in fact, they are the main builders of victory. To give the most obvious example, during the fierce battle on the eastern front of Xuzhou, the supply line on the southern line of the Tianjin-Pukou Railway was cut off after Suxian fell due to insufficient forces. Xuzhou had in fact become an isolated city. Without air supply, the army's food would be a problem. However, the air transport troops played a role at this time, transporting rice and ammunition from Nanjing to the front line in an endless stream, and transferring a large number of wounded soldiers from Xuzhou to the rear for treatment. Their tireless efforts made a contribution to maintaining morale that is difficult to estimate. (Continued on page 4)</p>

<h3 id="e19">Handling the Shanghai Refugee Problem <a href="#e19" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c19" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">19</a></h3>
<p>In recent days, refugees from north of the Yangtze River have been pouring into Shanghai like a tide. Faced with this serious problem, the Bureau of Social Affairs, in addition to actively launching winter relief fundraising, has also submitted a request to the Municipal Government to forward to the Central Government to quickly formulate a solution to thoroughly relieve and evacuate them, so as to avoid refugees from all over gathering in one place. Shanghai is already a city of five million people, and the source of food and fuel is very difficult. Now, in this extraordinary period, society is turbulent and people are uneasy. If the cold winter is added, the relief of refugees will become a serious and worrying matter. The Shanghai Municipal Authorities are brave in taking responsibility for the relief of refugees, and we deeply agree with this, and hope that the refugee problem facing us will be dealt with quickly and effectively, so as to reduce the phenomenon of refugees concentrating in cities.</p>
<p>Shanghai has always been a city with a wide gap between rich and poor and uneven distribution of happiness and suffering. The annual increase in Shanghai's population is accompanied by an increase in poor and helpless people. These poor people and refugees from the north account for a large proportion of Shanghai's population and have become the most serious social problem. According to an investigation by our reporter in February of this year, in addition to the poor people and refugees wandering in the streets who are difficult to estimate, there are as many as 64,000 poor families living in shantytowns, divided into: 15,000 families in South Shanghai, about 80,000 people; 15,000 families in West Shanghai, about 90,000 people; 8,000 families in North Shanghai, about 50,000 people; 20,000 families in East Shanghai, about 100,000 people; and 6,000 families in Pudong, about 30,000 people. Since the beginning of this year, the influx of refugees has been increasing day by day. According to an investigation by the Municipal Police Bureau in June, there were about 16,000 refugees who had not been accommodated. After June, newcomers continued to pour in, especially in recent months, refugees from the Tianjin-Pukou Railway line and northern Jiangsu have successively poured in, distributed in urban and rural areas, either accommodated by the authorities or still wandering in the streets, lonely and helpless, not knowing where to turn to. From the perspective of social security, this is a threat to the tranquility and order of Shanghai society; from the perspective of social problems, this is the best opportunity for Shanghai citizens to be considerate of others and be willing to help others.</p>
<p>First, let's talk about social relief: The relief of poor people and refugees is a type of social relief. In the past, Shanghai had a "Winter Relief Association" for the relief of refugees, and its main tasks were to provide shelter from the cold and distribute porridge. This contained the meaning of almsgiving and charity, and it failed to cooperate with administrative plans. The "Winter Relief Association" ended in April and established the "Shanghai Relief Committee," which, in addition to continuing the work of winter relief, also planned to implement active welfare measures to stabilize the lives of the unemployed and homeless refugees. Because for several months, they only focused on fundraising and design work, the establishment of "Relief Homes," "Civilian Villages," and "Work-for-Relief Offices" has not been discussed yet. Now that the cold winter solstice is approaching and the situation is extremely serious, the refugee problem is imminent. It is hoped that the Relief Committee will work hard, based on the experience of winter relief in previous years, and quickly launch relief work. It is also hoped that local philanthropists will assist the government and relief agencies in implementing various relief efforts in accordance with the spirit of helping the weak and aiding the poor. Although this cannot completely solve the social problem, it can undoubtedly eliminate the hidden dangers of the social problem passively.</p>
<p>Secondly, let's talk about social security. Although social security in extraordinary periods is not completely threatened by the refugee problem, the increase in refugees in a turbulent society can constitute a major burden for the local government, such as the burden of food and clothing, as well as the burden of living security. These burdens have a direct and indirect impact on the tranquility and order of society. Therefore, in order to ensure social security in extraordinary periods, local governments should, in addition to passively accommodating and relieving refugees, effectively evacuate them to reduce the concentration of refugees. This is indeed very important and should be known and acted upon immediately. On the one hand, the evacuation method is to assist refugees to return to their hometowns in a planned way. If they cannot return to their hometowns temporarily, they should be evacuated to provinces and regions with sparse populations to engage in farmland cultivation and industrial production, and not allow the dispersed people who are concentrated in the cities to linger and forget to return. On the other hand, the evacuation method is to strictly restrict the entry of refugees. All ports and stations in Shanghai must be strictly inspected and registered. Those who have no relatives or friends to rely on or those who cannot produce work are refused entry and sent back free of charge, or accommodated by neighboring counties, and the expenses are subsidized by the city. These evacuation methods are all methods that take helping others as the root of happiness, and they are reasonable and should not be difficult to implement.</p>
<p>In short, the current refugee problem in Shanghai has constituted a serious social problem. If effective measures are not taken from both social relief and social security, the threat to Shanghai's security will be worrying.</p>

At 9:15 a.m., Sun presided over the handover ceremony and gave an introductory speech, praising Commander Zhang's contributions since the Northern Expedition, the suppression of bandits in Jiangxi, and during the Anti-Japanese War. He especially praised the achievements of the 52nd Army, which Zhang had commanded in the Northeast, in suppressing bandits. He said that Zhang's appointment as Commander of the Capital Garrison was indeed a well-deserved appointment. Then, Commander Zhang gave a speech, first expressing his humility and gratitude for Sun's introduction. He then said: This time, I have been appointed as the Commander of the Capital Garrison at a time when the situation of suppressing the rebellion is tense and serious. Accepting the appointment in times of crisis is the duty of a soldier. In the future, I will definitely work hard to serve the country, share the worries of the leader, and unless the communist bandits are eliminated, the country and the nation will hardly be able to revive, and the suffering of the people will inevitably deepen and cannot be relieved. I hope that all officers and soldiers will adhere to the spirit of "either the bandits or us" and work hard for the country.</p>

<h3 id="e48">300,000 Pro-Soviet Germans Demonstrate; East Berlin Government Established; Sokolovsky Protests West Berlin Elections in Writing; Tensions High on the Border of the British, American, and Soviet Zones <a href="#e48" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c48" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">48</a></h3>
<p>[United Press Berlin 30th] The Communist Party of Germany, supported by the Soviet Union, established another city government in Berlin today to stand in opposition to the anti-communist city government. The anti-communist city government will be formally elected by the citizens this Sunday. The Soviet-occupied zone of Berlin has prohibited citizens from participating in the voting.</p>
<p>[United Press Berlin 30th] The German Communist Party convened a large demonstration on the 30th to support the establishment of a separate government planned by the Soviet Union in the eastern sector. The West German authorities ordered the police to be on alert. Special units of the German police were dispatched to the border between the Soviet and British zones, where 30,000 workers will gather on the "Unter den Linden" avenue on the afternoon of the 30th to compete in a short-term showdown with the anti-communist pre-parliamentary demonstration of September 9th. After listening to speeches, the workers will march in formation to the State Academy of Arts, where the "democratic council" of 300 city council members will produce a separate government for East Berlin, ultimately splitting the city government and completely dividing Berlin. Political experts believe that the Communist Party's actions are aimed at counteracting the municipal elections in the western sectors next Sunday.</p>
<p>[United Press Berlin 29th] The Berlin Communist Party and the Soviet authorities have been brewing a new crisis in Berlin on the 29th, and they are apparently preparing to announce the establishment of a Red German government in the Soviet zone. Marshal Sokolovsky, the commander-in-chief of the Soviet forces in Germany, has formally protested in writing to the Western military authorities in Germany against the city elections on the 7th. Sokolovsky denounced the election as being forcibly imposed on the Germans through "police persecution by democratic organizations." Sokolovsky also threatened to take action against the anti-democratic elements in the city government. This will divide Berlin into two. Colonel Howley, the U.S. military commander in Berlin, stated at a press conference regarding the Communist Party's threats and the decision by the Western Allies to hold municipal elections in the western sectors that the Soviet Union's actions are part of a "rule by force" plan. Howley also stated that the time for a complete diplomatic showdown between East and West has matured. Berlin is only the crisis center of the East-West split. Before the Berlin problem can be completely resolved, the Soviet Union must change its attitude. First, the Soviet Union should lift the Berlin blockade and stop using force politically. Second, the Soviet Union should fulfill all treaties not only in writing but also in spirit. Third, allow the Germans to establish their autonomous government without pro-communists. Fourth, stop the anti-American movement in Germany. Fifth, stop acts of terror such as kidnapping and illegally arresting anti-communist Germans. Sixth, show trust and a spirit of compromise.</p>
<h3 id="e49">New Mediation Plan for the Berlin Problem; Four Powers Express Acceptance; Commission to Be Established to Study the Currency System <a href="#e49" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c49" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">49</a></h3>
<p>[United Press Paris 29th] Argentine Foreign Minister Bramuglia stated today that Soviet representative Vyshinsky has "expressed agreement" to the new plan for neutral countries on the Security Council to mediate the Berlin dispute. The United States, Britain, and France have also accepted it in principle, and will submit a formal reply tomorrow as soon as their respective governments approve it. At that time, the work of finding neutral currency experts to form a commission will begin, and they will work with experts from the four major powers to deal with the Berlin currency system issue. The compromise proposed in the new plan can break the deadlock in which Western countries refuse to conduct any negotiations under the threat of a Soviet lock.</p>
<p>[United Press Paris 29th] The four powers gave a tentative agreement on the 29th to the new proposal put forward by Argentine Foreign Minister Bramuglia, the President of the Security Council, recognizing that resolving the Berlin currency problem is a necessary step to end the Berlin blockade. However, according to authoritative sources, Western countries believe that Bramuglia's new proposal is just a tacit admission of the failure of neutral countries to mediate the Berlin crisis. They believe that the situation in Berlin is rapidly deteriorating, and Berlin may have already split in two before the United Nations can implement any mediation. It will take at least a month for the expert commission to study the currency problem. They believe that this is just a new twist on previous suggestions and there is no hope of resolving the Berlin crisis soon.</p>
<p>[United Press Paris 30th] Argentine Foreign Minister Bramuglia's term as President of the Security Council this month will expire at midnight today. The Belgian representative, Langehenhove, will succeed him as President on the 1st of next month. Bramuglia is scheduled to go to Italy on the 1st, but said that he may change his plans if necessary.</p>

<p>[Agence France-Presse Berlin 29th] According to the Soviet-occupied zone's APN news agency, the U.S. authorities plan to airlift a U.S. armored division to Berlin before December 15th. Colonel Howley, the commander of the U.S. sector in Berlin, has neither confirmed nor denied this. The APN news agency's information is based on the conversation of U.S. officials at Tempelhof Airport with German workers. The U.S. authorities, in view of the difficulty of transporting heavy tanks, have decided to transport armored vehicles equipped with light weapons. Several armored vehicles have already arrived in Berlin.</p>

The proposal also calls on the permanent members of the Security Council to use the veto power only in matters of extreme importance to avoid its abuse.</p>

<p>[United States Information Service Washington 29th] The U.S. Department of the Navy announced that the rich fishing resources of the U.S. Trust Territory in the Pacific are now open to fishing vessels of all countries. The Deputy High Commissioner of the Territory is currently preparing to consider proposals from companies willing to fish in the Pacific. The area open to commercial fishing includes the Marshall, Caroline, and Mariana Islands. These islands were formerly mandated islands of Japan before the war and are currently under U.S. trusteeship under a United Nations agreement. The area covered by the sea surface is equivalent to the area of the continental United States. According to the orders of the Department of the Navy, fishing licenses will be issued by the Deputy High Commissioner of the Trust Territory, whose headquarters is located in Guam. The Department of the Navy stated that these fishing licenses will be cancelled or modified at any time if the safety or interests of the local residents are affected.</p>

<p>[United Press Paris 30th] British and American experts revised the Palestinian mediation plan overnight last night until dawn today to prepare it for submission to the Political Committee of the UN General Assembly.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse Paris 30th] In the amendments to the Palestinian proposal jointly put forward by Britain and the United States, representatives of both sides have reached an agreement on general principles. This is the result of a major step forward by the British representatives. The main concession made by the United Kingdom, it is reported, is the cancellation of the points involved in the Bernadotte Report. In other words, the United Kingdom will no longer support Bernadotte's final conclusions in this General Assembly. In this way, this General Assembly only needs to decide on the implementation of the Partition Plan of November 20, 1947.</p>
<p>[United Press Paris 29th] Israeli Foreign Minister Shertok formally submitted a note to UN Secretary-General Lie today, applying to join the United Nations.

<p>[United Press Washington 30th] Government officials predicted on the 30th that within the next year, the United States will conclude joint defense alliances with most countries in the Western world. This alliance includes the Rio de Janeiro Inter-American Treaty of Reciprocal Assistance and the North Atlantic Security Agreement that is being brewed. Congress approved the Rio Treaty in October, which will take effect next month. This winter, the United States, Canada, and the five countries of the Western European Union will each send representatives to meet and establish the North Atlantic Agreement. The participation of the United States is subject to the approval of the next Congress. The five countries of the Western European Union (Britain, Belgium, Netherlands, Luxembourg) have drafted a proposal for the establishment of the Atlantic Treaty, which is expected to be submitted to Washington by the ambassadors of the five countries to the United States this week. The Rio and North Atlantic agreements will obligate the United States to help defend a large part of the world. This "security area" will run through the North and South Poles in the Western Hemisphere and then cross the Atlantic Ocean to reach the main anti-communist countries in Western Europe. Before the Rio Treaty takes effect, the fourteen American countries should submit their ratification documents to the Pan American Union. So far, thirteen countries have submitted ratification documents, including the United States. The fourteenth country, Costa Rica, will submit its ratification document next month. According to the Rio Treaty, if any one of the contracting states is subjected to armed attack, the other states shall consider it as an attack on their own country and shall have the obligation to immediately respond to the attack with actions that they deem appropriate. Therefore, in this situation, in accordance with the U.S. Constitution, Congress will ultimately decide whether to participate in the war.</p>

When the debate begins on the afternoon of the 30th, members of the left and right extremes and centrist parties will question Foreign Minister Schuman on the French government's position before the Anglo-American Ruhr area becomes a reality. Due to the recent decision by the United Kingdom and the United States to allow France to participate in the management of the Ruhr area, Schuman's position is relatively easier and the government is not at risk of splitting.</p>

<p>MacArthur's statement did not clearly state whether only the two appellants or all seven convicts would be allowed a temporary stay from execution. However, since the regulations included in the appeal apply to all, it can be regarded as all death convicts will be temporarily stayed from execution. MacArthur's surprising action was issued only a few hours after receiving unofficial news here that Hirota and Doihara had filed appeals. MacArthur Headquarters issued a special communique stating, "Regarding press inquiries as to whether the execution of the convicts will be carried out before the U.S. Supreme Court rules on the appeal, MacArthur clearly replied: Not such a thing."</p>
<p>[United Press Tokyo 30th] Warren, the defense lawyer of Doihara, the Japanese instigator of the invasion of China, declared today that Doihara and Hirota Koki have filed appeals with the U.S. Supreme Court. (The court is scheduled to open on the 6th of this month.) He does not intend to ask MacArthur for a temporary stay of execution, but will notify MacArthur of the appeal. It would be too strange if it were executed before the Supreme Court ruled. Hirota's defense lawyer Yamaoka also said that he hopes to postpone the execution until the U.S. Supreme Court rules on the appeal case. The defendant's lawyers believe that this appeal case is completely different from the cases of Yamashita Tomoyuki, Honma, and German war criminals. The defendant questioned the power of the eleven-nation organizational court to try Japanese war criminals, and questioned the charter on which the court was based. The U.S. Supreme Court should rule on the validity of the International Military Tribunal for the Far East and its charter.</p>
<p>[United Press Tokyo 30th] Colonel Eges, a spokesman for General MacArthur, pointed out on the 29th that the appeals to the U.S. Supreme Court by Doihara and Hirota do not bind the Supreme Commander of the Allied Forces. He said: "According to the powers granted by the Far Eastern Commission, MacArthur is the final reviewer." The Allied Headquarters here have not received official notification of the appeals filed in Washington. Allied Headquarters lawyers speculate that if the U.S. Supreme Court believes it is necessary to suspend the execution, it must request President Truman to order MacArthur to suspend the execution.</p>
<p>[United Press Washington 30th] Legal circles expressed some doubts on the 30th about whether the U.S. Supreme Court can interfere in Japanese war criminal cases. They pointed out that in the past, the Supreme Court has refused to overturn the judgments of war criminals.</p>

<p>Only Over One Hundred U.S. Dollars After 8/19</p>
<p>[Central News Agency Washington 29th] U.S. Department of Commerce reports: In October of this year, the United States imported nearly 130 million U.S. dollars of gold from abroad, and imported silver worth 7 million U.S. dollars. However, the value of gold bars imported from China to the United States was only 132 U.S. dollars. In the week before the tenth of this month, China exported silver bars to the United States worth 133 yuan and gold bars worth 34 yuan. This is the first time that gold and silver have been shipped from China to the United States in the weeks since the 8/19 currency reform. Usually, the United States imports about 100,000 U.S. dollars of gold and silver from abroad each month, and the large amount of gold and silver worth more than 1 million U.S. dollars imported into the United States from abroad from August 8 to early September was apparently shipped from China to the United States before August 19. At the same time, the Department of Commerce also announced that China has been allocated surplus fuel oil and oil worth 200,000 U.S. dollars, which are scheduled to be imported into China this winter.</p>

<h3 id="e67">Living Index Up 15.4 Times; An Increase of 90% Compared to the First Half of November; All Members Attending the Editorial Board Meeting Expressed Satisfaction <a href="#e67" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c67" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">67</a></h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] The Municipal Employee Living Cost Index Compilation and Review Committee held a meeting at 3 p.m. yesterday in the Municipal Government Conference Room. Zhang Zongmeng, the Director of Statistics of the Municipal Government, presided over the meeting and reported that the employee living cost index for the second half of November was 15.4 times the base period of "August 19." This was a 90% increase compared to the first half of November. The categorized indexes were: Food 1680, Housing 1310, Clothing 1160, Sundries 120. According to Zhang Zongmeng's report, the price increases below tenfold during this period included: cotton, fresh fish, spinach, trams, and soap, etc. Price increases between tenfold and thirteenfold included: green vegetables, sugar, electricity, coarse cloth, shirting, thread, and cigarettes, etc. Price increases between thirteenfold and fifteenfold included: tofu, matches, toilet paper, and haircuts, etc. Price increases between fifteenfold and eighteenfold included: Hsien rice, pork, and briquettes, etc. Price increases above eighteenfold included: chives, soybean sprouts, baiye (tofu skin), and fermented bean curd, etc. The index during this period was characterized by relatively low prices at the beginning of the month, followed by a sudden surge. Although prices generally declined slightly in the second half of the month, they remained at a substantial level, so the average for the second half of the month was higher than the average for the first half of the month. In addition, the adjustment of public utility prices also had some impact on the index, it was stated. After careful review by the committee members, the index was deemed satisfactory, and the meeting adjourned at 3:50 p.m.</p>

<p>[Report from our newspaper] The Shanghai Labor-Management Arbitration Committee held its 23rd meeting at the Social Affairs Bureau at 4 p.m. yesterday to discuss several motions related to wage issues proposed by the General Labor Union. Representatives from both labor and management engaged in heated debates during the meeting, which adjourned at 7 p.m. Wu Kaixian chaired the meeting, and the motions were as follows: (1) Amendment to the Interim Measures for Wage Adjustment in Shanghai: 1. Starting from December 1948, the wages of workers in all industries will be calculated and paid monthly based on the index, in accordance with these measures. 2. The legal tender base wages in April 1947, that were below 60 yuan will not be discounted. 3. For legal tender base wages in April 1947, that were between 60 yuan and 100 yuan, the 60 yuan portion will not be discounted, while the remaining portion will be reduced by 10% for each 20 yuan increment. (The base wages listed in the preceding two items refer to the legal tender base wages before conversion to gold yuan). 4. Professional workers without fixed workplaces (i.e., transient laborers) will not have their base wages discounted. 5. If the management and labor parties reach an agreement on their own due to poor production or business conditions or other special reasons, that agreement will still be followed. (2) The General Labor Union's motion requesting that all production and professional workers have their wages calculated based on the current index was resolved to approve that all production and professional workers, except those whose work is not fixed or those with agreements between labor and management or those determined by arbitration and adjudication, will be paid based on the current index. (3) The General Labor Union's motion requesting a temporary postponement of the deduction of wages loaned to employees of various factories in November due to difficult living conditions was resolved to approve. (4) The handling method for disputes over the conversion of wages to gold yuan in the local shirt industry was resolved through adjudication that the wages in that industry should be calculated based on a gold yuan base wage of 3 yuan per dozen, according to the current index. In addition, the "Standards for Wage Calculation and Distribution After the Restoration of the Living Cost Index Wage Calculation Method" were retroactively approved.</p>

The November coal briquettes are also being prepared, and the distribution date is expected to be in the second half of December. Public educators who have certificates can choose to receive the physical objects or exchange them for the difference.</p>

<p>The two brothers immediately returned home with their lawyers.</p>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] Zhan Peilin, chairman of the Paper Industry Association and owner of Yiji Xing Paper Store, and his younger brother Zhan Yutian, director of Yizhong Paper Mill, were accused of hoarding and speculation. Yesterday afternoon, the Special Criminal Court announced: "Zhan Peilin and Zhan Yutian are both not guilty." The reasoning for the verdict was that Zhan Peilin's storage of paper was related to his primary business and was registered with the Social Affairs Bureau. After investigation, the amount was found to be consistent, and the prices were not raised when sold, so it could not be proven that there was any hoarding or speculation. As for the stock of paper pulp in Zhan Yutian's factory, it was found to be insufficient for three months of use, so it could not be considered hoarding or speculation. After the verdict, the two defendants were entrusted to their defense lawyers, and the Zhan brothers immediately returned home with their lawyers.</p>

<p>[Report from our newspaper] According to news from the People's Food Allocation Office, the price of rice for the November ration will be announced today. Yesterday, relevant authorities held three consecutive meetings at the office of the US Economic Cooperation Administration (ECA) China Mission, but a price could not be determined. This was because the US representative insisted that the rationing price should be set at 95% of the market price for the last three days of November. If this were the case, the rationing price would be 350 yuan per shih (unit of dry measure), which local authorities believed was more than 17 times the "August 19" price limit, and was clearly too high, so they insisted on finding a way to reduce it. The last meeting of the three-person committee ended around 7 p.m. yesterday, but no decision was reached, so it was changed to be discussed again today before being announced.</p>

<p>[Report from our newspaper] The entire first and second comfort delegations of the National Comfort Association, having completed their mission of comforting troops at the front lines in Xuzhou, returned to Nanjing and Shanghai a few days ago. Zhang Daofan and Fang Zhi, the heads of the delegation, and Chen Boliang and Ling Yingzhen, members of the delegation, held a press conference yesterday at the New Life Club to report on the progress of this trip and the actual situation at the front. They pointed out that based on the observations of the entire delegation, they believed that the National Army had already won a strategic victory in the recent Battle of Xubeng. The morale at the front was unprecedentedly high, and the emotions of the residents were unusually calm. When the war reached its climax on the night of November 17, clear artillery fire could be heard in the city of Xuzhou, but the residents continued their operations as usual, and no incidents of looting or disturbance occurred in the city. What was particularly admirable was that every night on the streets, citizens automatically assisted the army in guarding and patrolling. The close cooperation between the military and the people demonstrated the determination of everyone at the front to eliminate the bandits. They also pointed out that the government should promptly issue an order to stop the phenomenon of officials' families fleeing in the Nanjing and Shanghai areas. These people usually receive high official positions and generous salaries. In times of crisis, they simply leave. The government should investigate and confiscate their property to reassure the people.</p>
<p>Recalling Interesting Experiences</p>
<p>They recounted various interesting experiences they had witnessed in the bandit suppression troops: For example, when they were comforting troops at the Wei Jiahe front, they met a soldier named Wu Yinong, who lived at 124 Haichao Temple Street in this city. He turned out to be a volunteer soldier from the former Shanghai Garrison Command. In the wounded soldier hospital, they met Feng Kunshan, who lived at 207 Xingguo Road Intersection, Qiujiang Road in this city. He claimed that he only had minor arm injuries and asked them to tell his family not to worry. He also said that as soon as he recovered from his injuries, he would return to the battlefield to avenge this defeat. They also discovered Zhang Zijun, an 18-year-old female student from Mengcheng, who volunteered to serve in the bandit suppression work in the Qiu Corps, which was a good example for women. There was also a soldier in the Qiu Corps who sneaked into the bandit camp alone and claimed that their brigade had been surrounded, urging them to surrender early. As a result, he persuaded more than 30 bandits to surrender. Other events, such as junior officers of the National Army devising plans to annihilate the enemy and bandits defecting, were well known among the people in the front.</p>
<p>Finally, the entire delegation also cited various new atrocities committed by the bandits in the recent battle, saying that people aged 16 to 45 in areas occupied by the bandits have recently been forced to become "bomb heroes." The method is to form a team of five or six people, tie their hands and feet together, hang grenades on their bodies, and order them to charge at the National Army positions. During the meeting, they showed photos taken from the front lines. The feet and arms of corpses all over the ground were tightly bound with cloth strips. The bandits' contempt for people's lives and their cruel and insidious nature were infuriating. Furthermore, the bandits have recently had difficulty with supplies, and the troops are eating raw peanuts to satisfy their hunger. They also have to walk more than 100 miles a day, causing resentment everywhere. In addition, Liu Bocheng and Chen Yi are at odds in the Xubeng area. Chen's bandits suffered approximately 100,000 casualties in the previous encirclement and suppression by our large troops. He accused Liu's bandits of not being able to assist friendly forces, but Liu's bandits distributed leaflets attacking Chen Yi for heroism and sacrificing comrades. These leaflets have been repeatedly found on the bodies of bandits, proving that the rifts in the bandit camp are deepening. After a little more suppression by the National Army, collapse is only a matter of time, it was said.</p>
<p>Fang Zhi's Speech Moved Listeners</p>
<p>Fang Zhi, the Deputy Head of the Comfort Delegation, said in his speech at the press conference: "This time, my brother and Head Zhang, along with representatives from all walks of life in Nanjing and Shanghai and friends from the press, went to the front lines in Xuzhou to comfort the troops, and it can be said that we have done our best. What we brought was a warm feeling of care from the people in the rear to the soldiers at the front, and what we brought back was a strong fighting spirit from the soldiers at the front in return to the people in the rear. The soldiers at the front have not failed the entrustment of the people in the rear. At the same time, I also hope that the people in the rear will not fail the hard work of the soldiers at the front." Fang also elaborated on the situation in Xuzhou, the comfort activities, the commendable and moving deeds of the soldiers, and the cruel scenes of the communist bandits, moving all who heard it.</p>
<p>[Another News] During this comfort delegation's visit to Xuzhou to comfort the troops, the Qiu Qingquan Corps sent a special letter to the two Heads Zhang and Fang and all members of the comfort delegation, expressing their gratitude.</p>

<p>[Report from our newspaper] Fu Zhengmo, commander of the local garrison district, has recently been ordered to take up a new position. The vacancy has been announced to be filled by Wei Rulin. Yesterday, all circles in the city held a welcome and farewell tea party at the Friends of the Military Club. More than 100 people attended, including Fu Zhengmo, Wei Rulin, and representatives from all walks of life, including Pan Gongzhan, Yu Shuping, Zhang Xiaosong, Wang Zhaoquan (representing the mayor), Tang Shichang (representing Du Yuesheng), Xie Renzhao, Commander Shao of the Wusong Fortress, Wan Molin, and Zhang Yiqu. Xie Renzhao first introduced the new and old commanders to all circles, saying that in the past, Commander Fu cooperated with all parties in the city, recruiting soldiers without disturbing the people, and achieved great results. Commander Wei once served as the chief of staff of the local garrison headquarters. This time, he will be handling military service affairs in Shanghai, and he will be able to do so with ease. Then, Speaker Pan arrived temporarily due to other important business and said in his speech that the Battle of Xubeng is currently underway, and the National Army's deployment is thorough and has absolute confidence in victory, but residents in the Nanjing and Shanghai areas are listening to rumors, resulting in a psychological floating phenomenon. Pan condemned the current elements of unrest, defeatists, and those who evade reality as inappropriate. He called on the five million citizens to immediately show their determination, practice self-help, and not hope to rely on others for assistance. If everyone is determined to contribute money and effort to help themselves and the country, the declining and pessimistic atmosphere in the country will surely change, and the bandit disaster will not be a problem. The government has now established a wartime system, and it is hoped that the citizens of the city will quickly establish a "wartime mentality," grasp the belief of "have enemy, have no me, have victory, have no defeat," and the bandit army will be pacified in the near future. Finally, Pan pointed out that conscription is the only opportunity for citizens to practice "self-help." If the conscription work can be promoted smoothly with the assistance of the people, then the army will be completed, and bandit suppression will not be a problem. Then, Commander Shao of the Wusong Fortress delivered a speech, calling himself a "Shanghai doorman." He said that he was determined to guard the gateway to the city and guarantee that the bandit army would never be able to invade an inch of land. Even if there were any changes, he would coexist with Wusong and fulfill his duties as a soldier. Finally, Commanders Fu and Wei thanked everyone, and the tea party ended.</p>

<h3 id="e83">30,000 Draftees to Receive Military Training Starting Today; The First Phase is for Those Aged 18 to 25; Detailed Rules for the Organization and Training of Self-Defense Forces Have Been Established <a href="#e83" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c83" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">83</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Citizens' Self-Defense Forces, after active planning by the authorities, have established brigade headquarters in various districts throughout the city since November 15. It has also been decided that starting today (1st), draftees will be selected from each district. On the principle of not affecting their original work, they will be organized into teams and begin basic military training. The training locations will be determined based on the conditions in each district, utilizing nearby parks and open spaces. The training time is stipulated to be one and a half hours per day in urban areas and two hours per day in suburban areas. For the first five days, life education will be implemented to cultivate the spirit of military life. Starting on the sixth day, basic military training will officially begin step by step. According to the organization plan proposed by the brigade headquarters in each district, it is tentatively set that 16 draftees of the appropriate age will be selected from each bao (group of households), and one fen dui (squad) will be established for every three bao. Three fen dui will form one zhong dui (platoon). The list of trainees in each district has also been compiled. Approximately 30,000 people will participate in the first batch of training today. This training is scheduled for three months per term, and a second batch of trainees will be transferred after the term expires, ensuring that every citizen receives basic military education and thoroughly arms Greater Shanghai, in preparation for peacetime and wartime, laying the foundation for national reconstruction.</p>
<p>In addition, the detailed rules for the organization and training of the Shanghai Citizens' Self-Defense Force have been established and announced by the Citizens' Self-Defense Force. The following is an excerpt:</p>
<p>[Organization] (1) Regional organization: In accordance with Article 4 of the organization and training regulations, the city's district baojia (household registration) system will be used to organize into brigades, platoons, and squads. The first phase of centralized training in the city will temporarily consist of one squad drawn from each platoon, totaling three classes, including the squad leaders and deputy squad leaders, a total of 16 people. The bao team officer will serve as the squad leader, and three squads will be combined to form one platoon. (2) In the first phase of centralized training, all those aged 18 to 25 (except those who have reached the age of 20 and have been conscripted into regular military service) should participate in the organization. If the specified age is insufficient for one squad, then the vacancies will be filled in order of birth date and household registration sequence with those under the age of 25. The remaining draftees from the centralized training may be retained for the next term. (3) Occupational organization: Employees of party and government agencies and various units of industrial and commercial organizations, with a number of people (aged 18 to 45) below 50, will participate in the bao platoon organization of their location. Those exceeding 50 people may form an independent platoon affiliated with the brigade headquarters. Those exceeding 300 people will be organized into an independent brigade (directly under the general brigade headquarters), without age restrictions.</p>
<p>[Training] (1) Term: Each term of training is three months, divided into four terms throughout the year. The first term is for those aged 18 to 25, the second term is for those aged 26 to 30, the third term is for those aged 31 to 35, and the fourth term is for those aged 36 to 45, with training being convened in rotation. If a draftee is unable to participate in training during the training period due to an accident, they may postpone the training until the next term. (2) Time: Training will be given for six to twelve hours per week. The principle for draftees in urban areas is to not interfere with business hours, and the principle for factories and suburban areas is to not interfere with production.</p>
<h3 id="e84">Evaluation of the Victory in the Battle of Xuzhou Continued from Page One <a href="#e84" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c84" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">84</a></h3>
<p>The Cost of Victory The general public in the rear is quite concerned about the results of the Battle of Xuzhou. As a result of extensive investigations by reporters at the front, it can be boldly said that the actual losses of Chen Yi's troops in this battle were approximately between 130,000 and 150,000 men. The Battle of Nianzhuang was a standard hard battle, with fierce fighting between the two sides lasting for thirteen days and nights. Huang's Corps' five armies were all elite, possessing the firepower of one hundred artillery pieces. Chen Yi's troops adopted an offensive posture, so casualties were particularly high. The battles in the west and south of Xuzhou were the steady and progressive advance of the National Army, and the losses on both sides were limited. The loyal and brave soldiers at the front also paid a price of nearly 100,000 men in this great battle to protect the Jianghuai region. Huang Baitao's Corps was the real hero in this decisive battle, fighting bitterly with an absolutely superior enemy in the small area of Nianzhuang. The enemy, based on its experience in the Northeast, used rumor-mongering and tempting broadcasts day and night to shake the fighting spirit of the National Army soldiers, but it proved completely useless. After thirteen days and nights of hard fighting, they finally salvaged the overall situation after Feng Zhi'an's defection, and finally broke through to join forces with the reinforcements. However, their sacrifice was also heavy. Of the original five armies, only five or six regiments broke through, and the rest died heroically. The other National Army units, such as Qiu's Corps, Li's Corps, and Sun's Corps, were all in high morale and accomplished their missions in the subsequent battles. The defense of the air force base in southeastern Xuzhou was defended by the 74th Army within Qiu's Corps. After successfully repelling the enemy's offensive, they were able to continue to press forward. There was only one air force base in Xuzhou. If there had been any mistakes, everything would have been lost. In the enemy's deployment for attacking Xuzhou this time, arrangements were made to first eliminate Huang's Corps, leaving the eastern flank of Xuzhou empty, seize the air force base, isolate Xuzhou from the outside world, and then concentrate all their efforts on dealing with Qiu's Corps to seize this important town in East China. As a result, their plans met with obstacles in both places, and victory belonged to the National Army.</p>
<p>Naturally, the greatest glory of victory should be attributed to the soldiers who actually fought; however, the quality and talent of the commanders are also decisive factors. General Liu Zhi, Commander-in-Chief of the Xuzhou Pacification Headquarters, was determined to sit in the besieged city with the determination to die this time, and did not sleep peacefully for more than ten nights. Under his encouragement, senior officers such as the army commanders went to the front line to supervise the battle in person, resulting in the unprecedented vigor of the National Army's morale in any past battle. And the one who planned strategies and commanded calmly was General Du Yuming, the Deputy Commander-in-Chief. General Du was directly appointed by the highest authorities after the emergency in Xuzhou. There were many Deputy Commanders-in-Chief in the Pacification Headquarters, but they had no real power. Du Yuming's official title was "Deputy Commander-in-Chief for Operations," indicating that this deputy had the great power to command and organize battles. Du is a very talented and famous general and is deeply trusted by the authorities. Within a considerable scope, he can make decisive decisions and change the decisions of the authorities on military deployments. Originally, the mobilization and deployment of the entire Battle of Xuzhou had to be reported to Nanjing. The Presidential Office sent inspectors to each army to collect local military intelligence and materials, and submit reports and suggestions to Nanjing. During the critical situation on the eastern flank of Xuzhou this time, Du Yuming made a very decisive decision to risk withdrawing troops on the western flank, shorten the defense line, and transfer the main forces of Qiu's and Li's corps to the eastern front within 36 hours, stabilizing the slow-moving situation. Speaking objectively, if the commanders at the front can do things with confidence under their principles, and do not have to report everything and lose opportunities, then even if today's situation is fragmented, there is still hope for reversing the future.</p>
<p>Favorable Impact The Battle of Xuzhou has come to an end, and the center of gravity of the war has now shifted south. Whether the traffic line of the Jinpu Railway can be restored depends on the evolution of the battle between Suxian and Bengbu. If we calmly and quietly weigh the value of this victory, it is not difficult to find the following points: (1) It has dealt a blow to the enemy's morale and restored the confidence of the National Army. Because after the defeats in Shandong and the Northeast, the enemy has greatly underestimated the National Army's combat capabilities and morale, and strategically abandoned the steady and progressive approach, and even wanted to take Xuzhou and Bengbu in one fell swoop, further threatening Nanjing and Shanghai to resolve the overall situation. Now, after this setback, their confidence will inevitably be weakened, and risky actions will be reduced. As far as the National Army is concerned, the sound of retreat has been heard everywhere in recent months, which has indeed affected morale. Now, after this victory, the morale of the army has been revived. The author dares to responsibly assert that the morale of the various corps around Xuzhou is very high. As long as the living conditions and treatment of ordinary soldiers are actively improved, the present and the future will be the Great Wall of the country. Here, I would like to especially emphasize one point, that is, we cannot overemphasize the casualties of the Communist bandits, because they control a large number of militias, and replenishment is easier than for the National Army. At the same time, the unconventional strategies they use do not require soldiers to undergo long-term training. Although this victory has caused the enemy to suffer heavy losses, it has not eliminated their ability to control troops and soldiers through political work, and they will definitely make a comeback soon. (2) It affects the American psychology towards China. At the beginning of the Battle of Xuzhou, the military attache of the American Embassy traveled to Xuzhou, and the nature of this trip is self-evident. At the same time, along with the Nanjing comfort delegation, there were seven American colleagues who inquired about military intelligence in every detail and went to the front line to watch the battle in person. Can you believe that this respectable colleague is not in substance an observer from the U.S. State Department in China? As far as the reporter knows, before the end of the Battle of Xuzhou, nine out of ten Americans in China lacked faith in the National Army, believing that the victory in Xuzhou was just propaganda and that no large-scale war had actually taken place. Now, having been on the battlefield and seen all the activities of the National Army, their views have changed. The current situation is that they trust that the National Army can maintain the overall situation, which is the prerequisite for American military aid to China. The achievement of the Battle of Xuzhou is very important from this perspective. (3) It proves the success of the National Army's new strategy. In the past, for the sake of prestige, the National Army had to defend famous cities and towns, resulting in the dispersal of troops and being at a disadvantage and passive everywhere. A year ago, the consumption of manpower and materials was extremely large, which fostered the enemy's current advantage. This strategy of holding on to the death went bankrupt with the abandonment of Changchun. The National Army is now fighting under a new concept, focusing on attacking the enemy's main force rather than competing for the gains and losses of one city or one pool. The victory in Xuzhou this time is the result of abandoning Bian and Zheng and concentrating elite forces. Similarly, after the center of gravity of the war in Xuzhou shifted south, Chen Yi and Liu Bocheng's main forces were concentrated between Su and Bengbu, and the rear in Shandong and Henan was very empty. The National Army did not take advantage of the situation to advance north and recover Zheng and Bian and southern Shandong, but actively mobilized its main forces south to participate in the battle, which is also based on the same reason. Bengbu is close to the capital and supplies are more convenient than Xuzhou. Under the pincer attack of the Northern and Southern National Army, we have reason to believe that the southern section of the Jinpu Railway (Xupu section) will be reopened in the short term.</p>

<h3 id="e93">Limited Import Quotas in the Future Will Adopt a Key Allocation System: Sharp Drop in the Market Price of Foreign Exchange Transfer Certificates <a href="#e93" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c93" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">93</a></h3>
<p>According to sources from the Import and Export Control Commission, after the implementation of the import and export trade linkage, the commission has stated that the original import quotas will still be allocated as usual and will not be reduced. However, in view of the fact that all previous import quotas were quite small in quantity due to foreign exchange expenditure constraints, but there were too many manufacturers receiving the allocation, and each manufacturer could only receive a small amount after allocation according to the ratio, this small amount of imported raw materials made it impossible for large manufacturers to utilize. Now, the commission has decided to reform the quota allocation method, abandon the policy of universal allocation, and adopt a key allocation system, so that all import quotas can be used in a concentrated manner, that is, actively support industry and commerce, and concentrate all import quotas on important manufacturers for batch utilization. This allocation method will be a great improvement compared to the previous universal allocation method.</p>
<p>Another report: The foreign exchange transfer certificate suddenly fell sharply yesterday. The initial price was 28 yuan, and then it fell to 27 yuan and 75 cents, which was a significant drop compared to the previous day. It is reported that the reason is that there are many rumors in the market, people are uneasy, and importers have no intention of importing goods, so the demand for foreign exchange transfer certificates has decreased, resulting in a sharp drop in the market price.</p>
<h3 id="e94">Central Bank Stipulates Two Methods for Handling Surplus Foreign Exchange <a href="#e94" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c94" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">94</a></h3>
<p>Regarding the handling of surplus foreign exchange, the Central Bank has specially stipulated two methods, and has issued Foreign Exchange Circular No. 166 to all designated banks to comply with them as follows:</p>
<p>(1) For surplus funds from export foreign exchange and overseas remittances, those that have been approved by the Bank in advance may submit a foreign exchange transfer certificate of the same value and resell the surplus foreign exchange to customers.</p>
<p>(2) For surplus funds from import foreign exchange, such as unused foreign exchange under expired letters of credit, when designated banks repurchase them, they will be calculated at 70% of the foreign exchange transfer certificate price on the date of exchange settlement. However, for foreign exchange that was calculated according to the foreign exchange balancing committee rate during the period from May 31 to August 23, 1948, and was not accompanied by a certificate of exchange settlement of the same amount, designated banks will still calculate it according to the original exchange rate when repurchasing it. The original transaction date of the above resale and repurchase of foreign exchange must be noted item by item in the foreign exchange daily report to facilitate auditing. In addition, the Bank's Circulars Nos. 146, 149, and 155 shall be repealed immediately."</p>

<p>Due to the fact that yesterday was the end of November, the demand for funds from all parties was quite large, and the monetary situation continued to be tight. The black market interest rate was between 90 cents and 1.20 yuan, and the exchange of cash notes for gold and silver increased sharply, and the shortage was even more severe.</p>
<p>Another report: Yesterday, the banking authorities, in view of the fact that all parties needed cash notes, strictly restricted cash withdrawals. Each customer was only allowed to withdraw 1,000 yuan from large banks and 500 yuan from small banks, but those with overnight funds could withdraw according to the deposit amount. The discount on commercial paper in the market was still 200 yuan per 1,000 yuan.</p>

<p>After the Cotton Yarn Cloth Management Committee was closed in July, the unfinished matters were continued to be handled by the Liquidation Committee. Now, the committee has been ordered to close by the end of the year, and has sold its stock of 6,000 pieces of yarn, 50,000 bundles of cotton, and 10,000 bolts of cloth to the Central Bank at a 10% discount, and is clearing all procedures. After the committee is closed, the new organization, the Textile Industry Experiment Institute of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, will be established at the original site of the yarn management committee, and Gu Baochang will be appointed as the director.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the yarn market was affected by the tight monetary conditions at the end of the month and sluggish sales. Frequent negative news caused sellers to become weak. With more sellers, the market atmosphere was depressed and prices fell.</p>
<p>42-count Blue Phoenix fine yarn fell by 1,200 yuan as soon as it was quoted. Although it had recovered in the middle, sellers flocked in, and it ended at 11,700 yuan, a drop of 1,300 yuan compared to the previous day.</p>
<p>40-count Gold Test ended at 10,800 yuan, a drop of 900 yuan. 32-count Silver Moon fell by 800 yuan. 21-count Variable Horse yarn was quoted as low as 7,800 yuan at the close, a drop of 1,500 yuan. The prices of other counts of coarse and fine yarn also fell uniformly by varying amounts ranging from 700 to 1,300 or 1,400 yuan.</p>
<p>The cotton cloth market was also affected by the tight monetary conditions at the end of the month and the dumping by northern merchants. Many floating accounts were settled. There was a general cry for selling in the market. Only Guangdong and local defense forces had some scattered demand. Quoted prices fell in a straight line.</p>
<p>12-pound Dragon Head fine cloth initially stood at 405 yuan, and then retreated to 400 yuan, falling all the way to a low of 375 yuan. Near the noon close, scattered short-covering pushed the price back up to 380 yuan, a sharp drop of 40 yuan compared to the previous day.</p>
<p>Four Gentlemen Yuan Biji was traded at a low of 370 yuan, and recovered to 380 yuan at the noon close, a drop of 30 yuan. The prices of other cloths also fell by about 10%.</p>
<p>Consolidated Export Tea</p>
<p>Domestic tea has been selling well since the Japanese and rural merchants have been buying continuously. Yesterday, the market's appetite was still strong, and prices were also stable due to sellers' firm stance.</p>
<p>It is understood that the various routes in Jiaxing are currently accepting low-grade coarse tea without hesitation. As for export boxed tea, the demand from French North Africa is quite urgent, but domestic tea prices are surprisingly high, making it difficult to promote sales smoothly for a while. Transactions are still at a standstill, the market atmosphere has not been revitalized, but people's hearts are still firm, and the foothold is particularly stable.</p>
<h3 id="e98">Sugar Market Retreats <a href="#e98" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c98" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">98</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market retreated because the Taiwan Sugar Corporation continued to distribute sugar, and the stock of sugar among the industry was sufficient, resulting in market saturation. However, because sales were sluggish, there was a shortage of orders, resulting in short selling on the market, and the market situation plummeted. No. 45 White Sugar initially opened at 400 yuan, and hesitated for a long time after the closing. Retail investors took the initiative to sell quickly, and people's hearts wavered, causing market prices to soften. It closed at 390 yuan, a drop of 35 yuan. Medium sugar and coarse sugar also fell by 20 to 30 yuan each, and other sugars fell uniformly by about 10%.</p>
<h3 id="e99">Rice Prices Fall Even More Sharply: Flour, Grain, Oil Cakes Also Fall Consistently <a href="#e99" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c99" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">99</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the rice market saw an even more dramatic drop. Production areas continued to report price declines, and holders of goods were still selling anxiously. In addition, the tight monetary conditions caused even more sellers. Rice shops were mostly waiting and watching due to the daily decline in prices, so sales remained sluggish and prices fell sharply.</p>
<p>Northern Market white japonica rice was down to 355 yuan, a sharp drop of 45 yuan. Glutinous rice fell by 50 yuan. High-quality early rice was 320 yuan, and bottom-quality rice retreated to the 300 yuan mark. The Southern Market initially fell sharply by 40 to 50 yuan, but recovered slightly at the close, a drop of 20 to 30 yuan. Yesterday, 3,532 stones of rice arrived in the Southern Market, and 5,252 stones in the Northern Market.</p>
<p>Flour: A major price drop has begun, with the prices of various brands falling by up to 20%. There was strong selling in the market. Lao Che flour fell to 114 yuan, and Bingchuan fell to 104 yuan, a sharp drop of 20 to 26 yuan each. Miscellaneous brands of flour fell by more than 20 yuan, and bran also fell a lot.</p>
<p>Miscellaneous Grains: Prices fell across the board, and sales turned sluggish. Soybeans fell by 5 to 10 yuan, and corn fell by about 5 yuan. Sesame seeds fell slightly by 10 to 20 yuan, and raw peanuts fell by 40 to 50 yuan.</p>
<p>Edible Oil: Prices fell sharply, and there were few buyers. Factories also offered a lot. Soybean oil closed at 660 yuan, a drop of nearly 100 yuan. Rapeseed oil closed at 530 yuan, a drop of 70 to 80 yuan. Soybean cake also fell by 7 to 8 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e100">Sluggish Actual Sales of Woolen Fabrics <a href="#e100" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c100" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">100</a></h3>
<p>Winter overcoat wool and long-haired velvet have some sales outlets, and prices are relatively stable. Domestically produced and Hong Kong-imported woolen fabrics have sluggish sales, and retail prices are all trending downwards. Feather yarn, sleeve lining, and Western cloth linings are mostly stable. Herringbone woolen cloth, halifax cloth, and four-ply women's colored woolen cloth are all trending weak. Biji continued to fall due to the stagnation of customer demand, and the same was true for Valdini. Grass green woolen gabardine has seen a decline in sales, but vendors are unwilling to lower prices excessively.</p>

<h3 id="e101">The Hong Kong Government's New Attitude: Will Expel Elements Resisting Allied Nations <a href="#e101" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c101" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">101</a></h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent for This Newspaper: Zhi Ji</p>
<p>[Report from Hong Kong, 28th of this month (via airmail)] London, 25th - Reuters reports: British Colonial Secretary Jones, in response to a question from a Member of Parliament, stated that the activities of the Chinese Communists in Hong Kong were being closely monitored. He also said that they were preparing to expel those Communists who were attempting to use Hong Kong as a base to resist the governments of allied nations. The National Daily here revealed that while Hong Kong officials declined to comment on Jones' statement, sources familiar with the matter stated that the Hong Kong authorities had directly and indirectly warned the rebellious elements residing in Hong Kong who oppose friendly nations' governments, instructing them to restrain their actions and not to exceed their status as political refugees. The sources also pointed out that this was the first time the British government had openly acknowledged the activities of the Communist Party in Hong Kong. The government's resolute preparation for this firm action may be a result of Hong Kong Governor Sir Alexander Grantham's return from the Singapore conference. While officials stated that this was a routine meeting, various reports have revealed that the conference discussed the issue of anti-communism, with particular emphasis on the activities of the Communist Party in Hong Kong. Observers here generally believe that the Hong Kong authorities' attitude towards the Communist Party will, at the very least, revert to the pre-war policy.</p>
<p>Expelling Communist Activities from Hong Kong</p>
<p>Following the release of the aforementioned telegram, various Hong Kong newspapers widely published it on the 26th. Due to the official British statement that "it is closely monitoring the activities of the Chinese Communist Party in Hong Kong and is preparing to deport several Communist Party members," newspapers in Hong Kong with political leanings prominently featured reports from their respective reporters interviewing Hong Kong government officials on the first page of the Hong Kong news section on the 27th. However, the three long-standing newspapers in Hong Kong, Kung Sheung Daily News, Wah Kiu Yat Po, and Sing Tao Daily, remained entirely aloof, refraining from any exploration of the matter.</p>
<p>Anti-China Activities Will Not Be Tolerated</p>
<p>The "New Life Evening Post" here provided the most detailed exploration of this issue, quoting extensively from statements by Hong Kong government spokespersons and the Commissioner of Police. However, the Hong Kong government declined to disclose the identities of the Communist Party members to be deported but stated that they might be deported back to the Chinese Communist areas. The New Life Evening Post reported that Hong Kong Police Commissioner MacKenzie stated that he would not reveal the names or deportation dates of the Communist Party members mentioned in the aforementioned telegram. When asked by reporters if he had a complete understanding of the matter but was simply keeping it a secret, MacKenzie smiled and said, "That is correct."</p>
<p>Names of Those Being Deported Not Disclosed</p>
<p>The Hong Kong government's Director of Information Services, Hogan, provided a more detailed explanation of the matter. He told the newspaper's reporters that the Hong Kong authorities did not wish to participate in the affairs between the Chinese Nationalists and Communists, but they also could not allow anyone in Hong Kong to undermine any friendly governments. Therefore, any actions by Communist Party members using Hong Kong as a base to oppose the Chinese government would not be permitted, as the Nationalist government was the regime currently recognized by Britain. Similarly, if the Kuomintang were to use Hong Kong to oppose the Soviet Union, it would also be prohibited, as the Soviet government was also recognized by Britain.</p>
<p>He said, "Hong Kong cannot be used by the Communist Party as an anti-government base in order to avoid putting Hong Kong in a difficult situation."</p>
<p>Regarding the details of the case involving the Chinese Communist Party members mentioned in the aforementioned telegram who were to be deported, Hogan also declined to disclose any information, but he emphasized that their deportation was only due to specific incidents. He responded to reporters' inquiries by saying that the deportation would be carried out by police officers and they would be sent back to the Chinese territories.</p>

<p>[Report from Chengdu, 27th of this month] Amidst a severe housing shortage, the Chengdu municipal government recently lost a lawsuit concerning the lease of property. The municipal government, lacking a fixed location, had leased a house from Shi Zhaowu, a deceased famous Sichuan gentry and military figure (Shi was Liu Wenhui's adopted son and was killed by Liu Xiang in 1936), to use as its offices. The lease expired last month, leading to a dispute over renewal. The landlord, Shi Dihua, moved his entire family into the municipal government building, occupying all offices and the auditorium, bringing the entire municipal government to a standstill. Chengdu Mayor Qiao Cheng then sued Shi in the local court for obstructing official duties. After several investigations, the court ruled that Mayor Qiao's charges were unsubstantiated and dismissed the case against Shi. Shi Dihua then countersued the municipal government for infringing on his property rights. The local court has accepted the case, subpoenaed Mayor Qiao, and ordered the municipal government to relocate. Currently, the mayor's office has been turned into a bedroom, the auditorium into a kitchen, and no one is working, bringing municipal affairs to a halt. The municipal government plans to reclaim the city's Zhongshan Park to build its own office space but is opposed by tenants and the Municipal Assembly. The mayor, despite his high position, is busy dealing with the housing shortage day and night.</p>

<h3 id="e105">Communism in China September 1948 Compiled by the U.S. House Committee on Un-American Activities <a href="#e105" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c105" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">105</a></h3>
<p>— Special Translation by the Editorial Department of This Newspaper</p>
<p>This report is the third section of "National Studies," Supplement Three of the report "Strategy and Tactics of World Communism" compiled by the Subcommittee on National and International Movements of the U.S. House Foreign Affairs Committee. It provides a detailed and objective account and analysis of the origins, characteristics, historical background, development process, relationship with the Soviet Union, U.S. attitude, and importance of China to the world based on factual materials. The original was published in September of this year, and it also mentions our recent currency reform, which proves the novelty of its sources.</p>
<p>When discussing the historical and social background of the Chinese Communist Party's development, this report points out that civil wars and international wars in agricultural countries are directly and indirectly beneficial to communism. However, it emphasizes that China is the only major power capable of maintaining cultural independence and cannot be conquered or divided by any external force. The report criticizes Mao Zedong's "New Democracy" from various perspectives and explains the reasons why it cannot be applied to China. When discussing the recent developments of the Chinese Communist Party, the report acknowledges its expanding influence and the possibility of the entire country turning red if it wins the civil war. However, it points out the various weaknesses of the Chinese Communist Party itself and states that if the world is willing to make efforts and has determination, the ultimate success of the Chinese Communist Party can still be curbed. Finally, it forcefully argues for the importance of China in world affairs and its relationship to the fate of peace and war in the world, advocating that the United States must cooperate with China and provide it with military, economic, and political assistance.</p>
<p>The domestic situation has evolved to a critical juncture. Madame Chiang Kai-shek is flying to the United States to appeal for aid to China, and the White House is closely monitoring the development of our country's situation in order to decide on a policy of aid to China. This report has been reviewed by U.S. Congressman Judd and other experts on Chinese affairs, and their opinions and criticisms are valuable for reference. Therefore, we have specially translated the entire text of each chapter, either in full or in part, according to the importance of the content, and will publish them in this newspaper daily. The entire text is divided into five chapters as follows: (1) China and Communism; (2) The Birth and Growth of Chinese Communism; (3) The Second United Front; (4) The Second Civil War; (5) The Importance of China.</p>
<p>(1) Preface</p>
<p>1. Chinese Communism is orthodox Communism. Its doctrines follow those of Lenin and Stalin. Its leaders have been trained in Moscow. Its policies and actions, its strategies and tactics, are of the Communist Party type. For more than thirty years the Chinese Communist Party has faithfully followed every twist and turn of the Kremlin's road.</p>
<p>The debate about the nature and true meaning of Chinese Communism in the United States has been greater than that about the Communism of most other countries in the world. The debate occurred among scholars and critics and was reflected in public opinion and the policies of the United States government. But today there is clear evidence that there is no need to continue the debate.</p>
<p>2. China itself is one of the centers of human culture in the world, with a history of three thousand years. China is a vast country, and its profound culture has made it strong enough to conquer its neighbors and annex its short-term conquerors. It is the only major power that has never been swallowed up by Western politics. China today is encountering the shock of two forces, Western science and industry, not gradually accepting them over the four hundred years since the European Renaissance, but suddenly and all at once. The politics of China in the past was more like the politics of the Middle Ages than the politics of modern Western countries. China has been forced to try modern democratic politics without the preparation of hundreds of years of constitutionalism and legislation. China has not yet enjoyed the peace of a modern nation-state.</p>
<p>3. Communism first appeared in China shortly after the Russian Revolution. Soon after, Comintern advisors followed and began to instill Communism into China and adapt it to the conditions of this non-industrial country. From then on, the history of Chinese Communism can be divided into the following four periods or stages:</p>
<p>1923 to 1927 - The First United Front Period.</p>
<p>1927 to 1937 - The First Civil War Period.</p>
<p>1937 to 1946 - The Second United Front Period.</p>
<p>1946 to... - The Second Civil War Period.</p>
<p>4. China has been used as a testing ground for the development of modern Leninist Communism. Since the Russian Revolution, Communism has faced two worlds: on the one hand - the West, which are the major industrial countries. Marx's "Das Kapital" was used as a diagnosis and a prediction for them. Among these countries, Germany was considered the country with the best chance to promote Communism. Before the Hitler era, the German Communist Party was listed as the pioneer of Communist parties in countries other than the Soviet Union. On the other hand - the East and the South, on most of the land in Asia, Africa, and South Africa, live three-quarters of the world's population. Most of these nations are industrially backward, have low levels of education, lack resources, and are politically naive. The Kremlin gradually took notice of these countries and discovered many good opportunities in them. As in the Soviet Union in 1917, these countries lacked democratic systems established on a long-standing foundation and were more suitable for promoting Communism than the industrialized countries of the West. In order to infiltrate this three-quarters of the world's population, China was used as a laboratory and testing ground. The Chinese Communist Party has maintained the status of the Kremlin's eldest daughter in this second world.</p>
<p>5. Communism in China has from the beginning exploited the surge of national patriotism and the anti-imperialist movement. At the same time, the early Communist Party in China also took the first advantage, that is, the early national movement in China had no precedents or past experiences to judge the consequences of cooperation with the Communist Party. It was not until 1927, when the Communist Party saw that China's victory and unity were tending to stabilize, and thus exposed their intention to turn China red, that the Chinese Kuomintang broke off relations with them, and then the first civil war began.</p>
<p>6. During the ten years of the First Civil War, the Communist Party gathered in an area, established a Soviet system, and launched a fierce defense against repeated attacks by the National Army. Finally, in 1935, they moved to Shaanxi Province in the northwest, seized an area, and established a government.</p>
<p>7. When Hitler's arrogance was high and Japan intended to invade, Moscow was eager to have Japan cause trouble in China, and then the Second United Front was formed. The Chinese Communist Party used its usual tricks of hypocritical patriotic propaganda to repeatedly demand the restoration of the national united front to resist Japanese aggression. In 1937, Chiang Kai-shek was forced to accept the requirements of this Second United Front, beginning an eight-year war that exhausted all of China's strength and gave the Communist Party an opportunity to recuperate.</p>
<p>8. The theoretical and propaganda guidelines of the Communist Party during the Second United Front period are published in Mao Zedong's pamphlet "New Democracy in China," published in 1940. The publication of this pamphlet served two purposes: first, to clearly explain to the Chinese Communist Party how to maintain the movement to seize dictatorial power; second, to use clever words to embellish the propaganda story, so that patriots would see it as patriotic, neutralists would see it as neutral, and liberals would also see it as liberal. Because any high-ranking Communist Party member knows that when the word "democracy" is used in Communist Party documents, it means the dictatorship of the proletariat, and most liberals do not know this secret, so this ambiguous trick is not as difficult as you might think. Although the era of writing this pamphlet has passed, the Communist Party has used it for many years as a very effective propaganda tool.</p>
<p>9. The Second United Front did not officially end until the beginning of the Second Civil War, but there was a very important transition period before this. The Soviet Union's participation in the war in the Far East accomplished something that was previously impossible, which was the Soviet Union's large-scale intervention in the Chinese situation. After the National Government troops occupied North China and Northeast China, they were destroyed by the dual pressure of transportation difficulties and the Communist Party's and the Soviet Union's interference. At the same time, the remaining weapons of the Japanese army were secretly flowed into the hands of the Chinese Communist Party to some extent. When the United States abandoned its mediation of the Chinese civil war and (erroneously) persuaded the National Government to accept the method of forming a coalition government with the Communist Party, the Communist Party prepared to re-launch the civil war with resources several times greater than before. In this way, the Soviet Union could move in as a wartime ally, quickly overturn the balance of power of the Chinese army, and then withdraw, re-launching a campaign of exclusion and anti-imperialist propaganda against the United States.</p>
<p>10. Communism in China has already gained many advantages. It can use the sudden national movement at any time. At least after 1926, it has used the opportunity of war. After 1927, it was able to control the land without bearing any national responsibilities. It organized its own Red Army. These conditions made the strategies and policies of Chinese Communism suitable for all economic and political problems. Its handling of the land problem illustrates its seemingly plausible claim to "solve" problems under these conditions. The Communist Party's control of any rural area is bound to cut off the countryside from the cities, and give the land of rich farmers to poor farmers. Therefore, it is easy to win the trust of these poor farmers, without causing a reduction in production. They do not have to deal with the entire problem, because they have only plundered or destroyed cities and machines up to now. They do not have to bear practical responsibility to the Chinese government, but rely on the state of war and destruction to feed themselves.</p>
<p>11. Chinese Communism has its advantages and its weaknesses. For twenty years, it has had no way to gain broad support from Chinese cities. It has always implemented irresponsible economic methods in the economic poverty of the countryside, and the inappropriateness of these methods is already very obvious. The National Government's firm refusal to join hands with the Communist Party, and the difficulties encountered by the Communist parties in Eastern Europe, ultimately stripped away its "New Democracy" mask and revealed its original intention of red dictatorship. But most importantly: China's problems can never be solved by the methods used by the Soviet Bolsheviks. Due to the lack of opportunity to develop vast lands, the population problem limits economic and political means, and within this limited scope, the Communist Party cannot achieve anything. This certainly cannot prevent them from vying for power, but they must pay an amazing price to obtain it.</p>
<p>12. The United States' mediation was based on the assumption that democracy and communism could be reconciled, which was the basis for efforts to establish a coalition government in China after World War II. At the same time, there is another assumption, that is, the meaning of the word "democracy" when applied by the Communist Party is the same as when we apply it. In Poland, Romania, Hungary, and Czechoslovakia, the word "democracy" has been exposed as a guise to impersonate "dictatorship of the proletariat". A coalition government under the cover of "New Democracy" only makes the work of seizing power easier. But before seeing this clearly, the United States made unprecedented efforts to help China establish a coalition government. Since then, many countries have tried the system of Communist Party participation in a coalition cabinet; the result has either been a Communist Party dictatorship or the expulsion of the Communist Party. The Chinese government's refusal to accept the Communist Party's conditions was clearly correct.</p>
<p>13. There are many signs to show that China has its own inherent resources, which China can use to save itself. Leaving aside the city's firm resistance to Communist forces, the literacy movement and local economic and social reform movement promoted by Yan Yangchu and Hu Shi, and many other experimental movements, have opened up a correct path to arouse and promote the vitality of the people. General Fu Zuoyi's recent efforts in Beiping have proved that some parts of these ideas have been applied to practical plans and have achieved promising results.</p>
<p>14. Whether for world communism or democratic and peaceful forces, China is a testing ground for fifteen billion people in the world to develop and test their path forward. The problems that need to be solved include technology and industrial problems. Economic issues, social issues, domestic security issues, and foreign political security issues, and finally, how to become a truly democratic political issue. China cannot solve its economic problems without assistance. China cannot solve the problem of domestic security caused by the Soviet Union's assistance to the Chinese Communist Party's instigation of civil unrest without military assistance. Moreover, China cannot enjoy foreign political security without the support of the United States and the United Nations. For more than thirty years, the Chinese Communist Party and the International Communist Party have always cooperated, seeking ways to make China a Communist Party dictatorship. If you want to solve the problem of how to make China a modern democratic country, it is best to solve it jointly by China and the United States. China's destiny will ultimately determine the destiny of Southeast Asia and the world.</p>
<p>I. China and Communism</p>
<p>A. Is it Communist Party type or Chinese type?</p>
<p>Communism in any country in the world is unique to that country in some sense. The Communist parties in any country are mostly natives. They speak the local language, read local newspapers, live local lives, eat local food, and play local games. The Chinese Communist Party is Chinese type, and Chinese communism is Chinese type.</p>
<p>Communism in any country is still communism. The meaning of 回回教（Hui Hui Jiao, Islam in Chinese） is obvious and well known to everyone. Similarly, whatever country's 美以美敎會 (Mei Yi Mei Jiao Hui, Methodist Church in Chinese) is still the Methodist denomination, and whatever country's Roman law is still Roman law, and chemistry is chemistry. In short, anything that people in more than one country have in common in their lives that transcends the characteristics of one country is a common thing. They come from the same source, and they can last for decades or hundreds of years without declining, relying on the preservation of books, and then being passed on and innovated. The people who live on them have learned them, and then spread them to others. Therefore, the Chinese Communist Party is Chinese and also the Communist Party. Their leaders are tainted with the thoughts of Marx, Lenin, and Stalin. They are familiar with Moscow's analysis of modern culture, the prediction of the Communist Party's future strategy, and the orders to guide the Communist parties in various regions to adopt the current actions.</p>
<p>For many years, one of the most important tests of Communist Party training has been following every twist and turn of the global Communist Party line. This test distinguishes Communist traitors from loyal believers. Most of the current Communist Party leaders have been selected through this test. When the Comintern adopted the Popular Front line in 1935, the Chinese Communist Party also followed this line. From 1937 to 1939, Moscow supported the Chinese National Government in resisting Japan. The Chinese Communist Party participated in the United Front and faithfully fulfilled its duties to China. From 1939 to 1941, Moscow referred to the European war as an imperialist war and adopted an isolationist attitude. At the same time, the Chinese Communist Party relaxed its resistance to Japan and strengthened its activities to seize power. After June 22, 1941, simultaneously in Moscow and Yan'an, the imperialist war became a war for freedom and democracy. After that, the Chinese Communist Party resumed its offensive to seize power in China. When the Soviet Union and China signed a friendship agreement in 1945, the Chinese Communist Party was quiet for a few months. In 1946, when it saw that the United States would not temporarily support the Chinese government, the Chinese Communist Party immediately openly launched a civil war. No Communist parties in the world have a better position than the Chinese Communist Party.</p>
