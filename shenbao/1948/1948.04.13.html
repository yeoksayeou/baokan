<h3>國民大會第六次會議　白部長作軍事報告　共匪實力已增不容輕視</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十二日電〕國民大會於十二日晨舉行第六次會議，因多數代表赴國防部參加中央紀念週，延至十時零五分開會。出席代表一五七四人，第九組主席團輪値主持，由王雲五主席。秘書處宣讀五次會議紀錄後，王氏報吿主席團十一日晚開會所作之兩項決定：（一）總統候選人十六日公告，副總統候選人廿日公吿，公吿方式為登國府公報，函吿各代表，及會堂門旁公吿。全塲無異議。今晨議程為軍事報吿反檢討，由國防部長白崇禧報吿，歷一小時之久，以時間關係，檢討未及進行，於十一時五十三分散會。白部長報吿時，國防部高級將領均在政府長官席上旁聽。</p>
<p>白部長之軍事報吿，共分三點：（一）國防部之組織及其職掌，（二）兩年來國防建設之趨勢，（三）共匪禍國陰謀之經過及其發展。此外，對華中實施總體戰，及軍人待遇微薄等報吿基詳，曾贏得若干次掌聲。</p>
<p>白氏首稱：東北華北西北華中各戰塲情形，蔣主席日前已有詳細報吿。國防部之組織，係參酌美英法制度及我國國情，國防部隸屬行政院，為一決策機構，其執行由參謀總長及陸·海·空·聯勤·四總司令負責。兩年來，係在維護國家領土主權之完整，預防外力侵犯之原則下建立國防，一面適應當前剿匪之需要，一面適應未來戰爭之需要。武器之進步與科學進步關係至大，國防部現協助國防科學委會從事研究。兵員方面，則實行徵兵制及高中畢業生集訓，作士兵及幹部之來源。</p>
<p>關於共匪禍國，白氏指出共匪藉抗日為名，襲擊友軍，擴充實力之經過。共匪部隊廿六年僅三萬人，勝利時已發展十倍，為卅一萬人。勝利後政治協商，共匪坐大，現已有野戰軍一百卅餘萬人，軍區部隊及民兵尙不在內。現共匪有邪惡年歷史，有百數十萬武裝人員，有國際背景，有鬥爭經騐，吾人不應輕視。去年七月一日，政府下令動員戡亂，決心以軍事解決共匪。共匪宣傳去年渡黃河，今年渡長江，並非空口宣傳。共匪渡黃河已實現，今年是否渡江，將視我方力量如何以為斷。</p>
<h3>發揮總體戰力量　完成戡亂不能僅恃國軍　必須組織民衆防患未然</h3>
<p>如何動員完成戡亂，白部長一再鄭重指陳，不能僅恃國軍，必須發揮民衆力量，不能坐待匪來，必須防患未然，尤盼與會各代表返鄕後從事領導工作，渠信必能以全民力量消滅共匪。白氏指出：共匪去年實行空心戰備，及求軍，求食，求戰之三求政策，我則以總體戰對抗。白氏以其自去年十一月七日奉命負責大別山區淸剿為例，謂：劉伯誠匪部約十二萬人，竄大別山，圖建根據地，我則實施總體戰，先以軍事擊破匪之主力，再以軍事掩謀政治，鞏固政治中心，組織並裝備民間武力，然後以政治配合軍事，實行淸剿，控制面，擊破匪的三求政策。此項辦法已逐漸收效，劉伯誠匪部大部北竄，大別山區殘匪僅三個團，正淸剿中。白氏謂：大別山之總體戰為一試騐，過去地方首長權限太小，致無法發揮力量，現各地劃綏靖區，人事，財政，諸權均集中於綏靖區司令官，今後當可發揮總體戰力量。白氏於盛讚豫西民國之後，謂豫西民團抗戰剿匪均建大功，豫西可做到，其他各省亦可做到。白氏特別介紹彼等之口號：「拚命保命，破產保產。」各地均可實行。地方自衛部隊由中央供給經費，起用在鄕軍人為幹部，各地並設兵工廠，補充械彈。白氏並透露，豫西已設有相當規模之兵工廠，約四個月後即可出產成品。</p>
<p>為未雨綢繆計，白氏主張長江以南各省，亦當擴大地方首長職權，組織民衆武力，消滅共匪潛伏力量，使不得為渡江之內應，勿待共匪過江後再做，則後悔已遲。</p>
<p>白氏於叙述軍隊紀律問題時，分析士兵軍官所得餉銀，實際已不及戰前之四分之一。士兵伙食不好，影響身體，亦影響戰鬥力，而取之於地方，則增加人民負担。實行總體戰，須士飽馬騰，將士始克用命。</p>
<p>白氏之結論謂：剿減共匪，吾人不必悲觀，必須有信心，如每一地方人民均能組織起來，拼命保命，破產保產，配合軍事進剿，戡亂工作必可順利完成。白氏並稱：各代表檢討軍事時，盼不吝指敎。</p>
<p>白氏報吿後，察哈爾代表張體方，山東代表趙庸夫，就東北及山東軍事情形發言，以時屆法定散會時間，即宣佈散會。</p>
<h3>主席派東立夫等　慰問絕食代表</h3>
<p>苦勸復食仍無結果</p>
<p>〔本報南京十二日電〕簽署當選之國代，絕食已逾兩週，蔣主席對渠等之健康甚為關懷，十二日下午特派陳立夫，谷正綱，賀衷寒，鄭彥棻等四人代表赴第五招待所慰問，並勸彼等復食。陳等於下午二時即抵第五招待所，當勸八代表應以健康為重，先行復食；至於出席大會問題，當可設法解決。苦勸至下午四時，絕食代表表示，在未獲具體之確切保證時，仍不願無條件復食，惟對蔣主席盛意，均表示甚為感動。</p>
<h3>國代檢討軍事　熱烈發主坦白陳詞　要求查究失職將領</h3>
<p>午後十二時半，國大續開大會，主席團第十組輪値主持，由黃季陸主席。于斌報吿主席團對王運明等一三二二人所提簽署代表問題動議處理經過後，即開始檢討軍事。要求發言之代表總數達二三〇餘人，但發言者每人多不能限於五分鐘以內，致迄晚六時廿分散會時，發言者尙不足卅人。一部份代表則以其書面意見請秘書處代為宣讀。綜合各代表之意見，大致集中於下列各點：（一）軍人待遇過低，士兵吃不飽，影響戰鬥力；（二）征兵弊端過多；（三）若干部隊紀律過劣；（四）統帥部指揮辦法應改善，使地方指揮官有權宜指揮之權；（五）勝利後東北華北遊雜部隊一一改編，迫上梁山，無異資共；（六）高級軍官貪汚不法，接收人員祇知物資，致民心喪失殆盡；（七）戡亂陣亡將士遺族撫卹不週，手續太繁；（八）中央應補充地方武力械彈；（九）賞罰不明，是非不辨，負責當局何以不予懲辦？有數代表對白部長報吿中未及華北東北，深表不滿。東北山東各代表，對參謀總長陳誠之責難尤甚，安東尹冰彥主張「借人頭」以提高士氣。遼北張振鷺要求蔣主席效法諸葛亮「揮淚斬馬設」。山東張履賢則以緊急動議，要求扣留陳誠。吉林崔天一要求對梁華盛撤職嚴辦。遼寗吳叔班謂：凡誤國之將領，應一律查明。此外，各地戰事緊急者，則要求立即派兵增援。張振鷺要求確保遼潘，打通瀋錦綫。安徽溫廣彝高呼華中危機不亞東北·華北。河南王掄靑請以大會名義，電請國防部派兵增援鄭·汴。熱河李培國謂：承德四面被圍，希望大會決議派兵援熱。安徽胡鍾吾指出，皖南潛匪應予肅淸。山東代表亦要求儘速派大軍解救昌樂·濰縣之危局。吉林霍天一則籲請政府以全力對付東北·華北共匪。會議至晚六時，主席宣吿延長廿分鐘，發言者仍多，最後決定將各代表意見交秘書處整理後，送國防部，俾便提出答復。</p>
<h3>遼西國軍益增強　瀋錦間交通即可打通　遼河北岸匪已被擊退</h3>
<p>〔本報錦州十二日電〕以錦州為中心之遼西走廊國軍實力日有擴充增强，此新生力量多係老兵入伍，為之裝備，即可作戰。又，連日在葫蘆島登陸之李彌部，多已抵指定地帶，為錦瀋注目及樂聞消息，瀋陽殷盼國軍打通錦瀋問交通，或為期不遠。此間軍事當局正作一行動計劃及部署范漢傑，孫渡來往瀋錦間及去葫蘆島，看登陸隊伍，並其他工作等，均顯示錦瀋交通勢必打開。</p>
<p>〔本報瀋陽十二日電〕遼河北岸舊門，三面船一帶，來犯匪五千餘，被擊退，此為糧食之爭奪戰，尙非春季攻勢之序幕。流竄沙河附近之匪猶在觀望狀况中，瀋南無戰事本溪安靜。</p>
<p>〔又電〕東北共匪積極修築鐵路，以利補給。哈爾濱至永吉及永吉至延吉兩條路綫均已修復，通遼至彰武間並已通車</p>
<h3>豫中戰局密雲不雨　陳毅陳庚兩匪圖以七萬之衆犯鄭州　滎陽東竄匪被迎頭痛擊</h3>
<p>〔本報漢口十二日電〕國軍收復確山·駐馬店後，豫南戰事已轉趨沉寂。聞陳毅匪三·八兩縱隊及陳賡匪四·九兩縱隊共約七萬人，岡圍攻鄭州。</p>
<p>〔本報徐州十二日電〕陳毅匪部第三縱隊陷新鄭後，十一日復北竄薛店·柏樹柳一帶。又陳賡匪四·九·縱隊及陳毅匪第八縱隊主力，十一日竄抵氾水東北與廣武間地區。另匪一部，十一日由榮陽東竄三官廟，守軍正予迎頭痛擊。</p>

<p>〔本報信陽十二日電〕劉伯誠之親信「華中軍區俘虜管理處」處長董紹明，於國軍攻克駐馬店後被俘，管理俘虜者竟被人俘，消息傳來，令人捧腹。</p>
<p>〔中央社鄭州十二日電〕此間陸總指揮部孫主任震，頃就豫中戰局向記者發表談話稱：鄭州西南呈密雲不雨狀態，共匪徘徊於廿里內外地區，該匪由鞏縣東竄者約三個縱隊，由臨江·郟縣間向鄭州以南竄擾者約一個從隊，匪如攻犯鄭州，三四日戰事當可結束。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕民社黨前日舉行之中央執行委員會中，曾作重要決議如下：（一）擁戴主席競選總統，認為主席之領導地位為二十年之史實所造成，當此國步艱難之際，總統非蔣主席莫馬；（二）提名該黨常委徐傅霖為副總統候選人；（三）反對於本屆國大中修改憲法，因所貴乎憲法者，在其能為政治行為之準繩，必待其施行，然後是非得失，方能見之實際，故反對未實行即修改；（四）對本屆國大代表及立委選舉中之操縱舞弊，表示遺憾。</p>

<h3>王耀武飛巡昌濰　在空中與守將通話並投親筆函　猛犯濰縣之匪屢撲屢挫</h3>
<p>〔本報濟南十二日電〕昌·濰激戰聲中，王耀武於十二日下午一時十五分飛昌·濰上空巡視。專機於二時正抵達昌樂上空，城內軍民見機到達，搖手示意，狀極興奮。環城四週匪戰壕及碉堡密佈，王氏當與守軍張景月通話，慰勉有加，並投下親筆函及手題「魯中堡壘」錦旗。繞飛上週後，至田馬上空巡視，二時十五分抵達濰縣上空時，西北關戰鬥正烈，北門外及城東北西北三面有大火四處，北門外已成一片火海，白烟亦冒達千餘公尺。王氏當與守軍陳金城通話，以「一切均有辦法」，「一定勝利」，「一定成功」勉慰。於濰縣上空巡視三週，復至坊子·寒亭等地巡視，至下午三時四十分返濟。</p>
<p>〔本報靑島十二日電〕濰縣·寒亭·昌樂·田馬·國軍仍堅守，戰事白熱化。十一日晚匪向濰城再次猛攻，南關擂敲山·南大營戰事尤烈，匪曾數度突破城關陣地，終被擊退，四關刻均屹立，匪軍以重砲轟城，居民頗有傷亡。飛機塲，廿里堡，坊子，雖情况不明，坊子可能仍在國軍控制中。昌樂守軍張景月部，十一日晨三路出擊，將匪渤海十四，十五，團之兩個營完全擊潰，並破壞匪調堡，昌樂田馬陣地極鞏固。</p>
<h3>昌樂濰縣代表　抵京請派援兵</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十二日電〕魯中昌樂·濰縣區代表李郁廷特來京請兵，據談：昌濰地區為戰略要地，且為魯人情神堡壘，守昌·濰者為國軍一個旅及地方部隊十個團，共匪自十日起全力猛攻，守軍正奮戰中，濰縣城內共有學生三萬五千名，義民亦衆，設不幸有失，人員損失將無法補償，吾人原擬請中央空運部隊往援，現因坊子機塲失守，惟盼靑島濟南兩地分派大軍進擊解圍，至少應以空軍協助部隊掩護學生人民撤退，絕不可坐視不救。</p>
<h3>臨汾東關國軍　自動西撤轉進</h3>
<p>〔本報太原十二日電〕臨汾東關十一日血戰，匪屍遍地，終以衆寡懸殊，國軍自動西撤，激戰轉至東門外外壕外緣，東關陷匪後，十二日戰况較沉寂，幹部學生參軍已近千人。</p>
<h3>國大紀程　唇槍舌劍討軍事</h3>
<p>〔本報特寫〕在充滿太平氣象的國大會堂里，今天也嗅到濃烈的火藥氣息了：舌劍唇槍，一面檢討失地誤國的責任，一面力挽狂瀾，欲借救兵；這一塲軍事撿討雖不能呼風喚雨，也總勝過紙上談兵。</p>
<p>國防部白部長今天長篇報吿，給人們的印象是缺少大家所重視的戰局，戰略的變遷，和當局對當前要局，戰術的準備；可是，在總體戰的軍·政。經的配合以及組織地方武力這幾點，頗令人滿意。不過當他的報告快近結束的時候，樓上一角傳來了聯珠砲的聲浪，自天而降；有人呼喚當前東北局勢的嚴重，樓下也發出山東代表要求懲辦負責者的呼聲；但因時問的限制沒有來得及聽取答覆，上午的會就結束了。</p>
<p>下午進行的應該是對於軍事報吿的檢討，黃季陸的主席坐鎭台上，發言條雪片似的飛上來。對於東北局勢的檢討，代表們要求熊式輝，陳誠到會報吿，他們要追究這弄成幾乎已經沒有一個完整縣城的東北的責任。東北代表一個連一個發言，每一句話。都博得一雷似的掌聲。</p>
<p>要提高士氣　倡幾個個人頭</p>
<p>安東代表尹冰彥在發言臺上說：「我的辦法最簡單，要提高士氣，祗需借幾個人頭用用。」代表們大喊贊成。當尹說到激昂處，不斷用拳頭擊桌子，而合下則以鼓掌和喊好來回應。尹冰彥的結語是：「請間當局，他們在東北作的對不對，如果對，就該授以靑天白日勳章，如果不對，就該殺！」遼北張振鷺說：「東北軍隊吃糧的有六七十萬，實際打付的不過三十萬，應該請國防部查一查！」遼北楊之屛說：「東北戰局是一盤死棋，到東北的軍官祗知道要房子，要汽車，討老婆，扣軍餉，軍官發財，士兵吃不飽，請問如何打仗？」李象泰說：「勝利時東北有偽滿軍十五萬，警察三十萬，都給赶到共產黨那裏去了，政府大員暗中帮共黨的忙，政府應不應該懲罰？」有一位東北女代表主張以平津為剿匪根據地，政治，軍事，經濟均由傳作義統一指揮。她說：「傳作義是北方人的唯一希望！」接着河南代表大呼鄭州·開對有如危城，陝西代表强調西北的嚴重不亞於東北，華北；江蘇，安徽，湖北代表說，大江南北匪蹤威脅京畿。到了最後，每位發言時就都提出「緊急動議」來號召，强調其重要性。他們要中央派大軍去援救以治標，組織地方自衛武力以治本；他們是代表着東北，華北，西北，華中千百萬人民的心聲，要把兩年的積怨趁這個時候向中央申訴，並提出具體的要求。</p>
<p>激昂而熱烈　呼聲夾掌聲</p>
<p>每一句話都真實，每一件事都痛心，會塲空氣和往日大不相同，往日是疲勞轟炸加上混亂喧囂，今天有的是熱情與正義的呼聲及掌聲；因此今天的大會時間意外的延長了廿分鐘，還覺得極度短促。最後，主席提出，將各代表意見無論口頭或書面，均交秘書處彙集整理，大部份人已獲得同意；於是這一塲帶有火藥氣的軍事檢討，就這麼結束了。（四月十二日於南京）</p>

<h3>專論　論所謂「教育的危機」</h3>
<p>— 毛子水</p>
<p>什麼是教育的危機？這個問題，似乎人人都能回答，但所回答的恐怕都不相同。最普通一個回答似乎是：「國家經濟狀况的不良，使敎員學生都陷於衣食不足的境地，還議什麼敎育！」但我以為經濟關係固然是阻碍敎育進步的大原因，却不是唯一的原因，並且不是最大的原因。就事實而講；現在國立大學中的學生，十分之七以上是有公費的。這種公費生，自己所負担的，不過是衣服和書籍等費。一個人要受大學敎育，至少似應　籌出這點費來。其餘十分之三的學生，或因家境較好，或因受到別種獎學金，眞正窮苦的，為數亦就不多了。至於敎員呢，家庭中人口繁多的，當然是十分的困難；人口較少的，薪水若能按乃調整，還可以勉强得個起碼的溫飽。在國家到這個地步的時候，我們內當以「君子固窮」自慰，外亦當以現在世界上動苦的好國民——如英國人——做榜樣。若一味要羡慕貪官汚吏或富商大賈的生活，那就是「自尋煩惱」了。</p>
<p>當然，我不是說現在我們國家的教育經費已沒有問題。敎育是需要設備的。高等敎育設備所需的費用，尤其浩大。因為他不只是需要書籍，並且還需要儀器藥品等。而這些東西，多半是要有外匯才可以得到。照我們國家財政的狀况，我們實在不能有這樣富足的外匯來充實所有國立大學的現代設備。</p>
<p>但我們現在中國的敎育，除却經費問題以外，實在還有更大的危機。這個更大的危機，就在敎員和學生的本身上。寫本篇文字的人是個敎員，請先言敎員。</p>
<p>敎員中有許多是學問和道德俱很高深的，亦有許多是一端偏勝的。前者固然是「經師人師」，後者亦足為後進的模範。但我以為敎員在傳授學術以外，在學生生活上亦應負指導的責任，敎員應把學生當作自己的子女看待。對於學生的好行為，固然是應當鼓勵和贊助；對於學生不妥的行為，亦應當吿誡和勸阻。現在中國教育大危機之一，就是敎員對於學生的行為太漠不開心了。</p>
<p>此外有一種更壞的現象，就是有些教員，為「爭取羣衆」起見，竭力迎合學生的心理，對於學生的行為，不管是非，虛加獎飾。這種人的壞處，實在比起只知道一味壓制學生的人還要大。因為後者可能居心還是為學生的好，而一味迎合學生心理的人，則個個都是「只要自己得法，不管他人死活」的。這種人雖然不多，但可以說是敎育界的敗類！</p>
<p>至於學生方面，情形亦有和敎員相似的地方。學生中有天資颕異，聞一知十的；這種學生，使人精神朗爽。學生中有勤學好問，循規蹈矩的；這種學生，使人心情愉快。學生中有從善如流，覓義勇為的；這種學生，使人志氣發揚。但這幾種學生，總算起來，恐只有全體學生的半數。其餘一半呢，大都分是可上可下的人。實在講起來，敎育的功用，倒是在「中人」上邊最顯著。可惜現在學校中的風氣太不好，使一般中人得不到「蓬生麻中，不扶自直」的好處，只得到「白沙在泥，奧之俱黑」的壤處。這實在是敎育的最大危機。</p>
<p>這種不好的學校風氣，由於學生本質的固然有，由於社會和學校當局所製造的要見到大部分。舉一個最易見而一般人以為無關重要的事情來說罷。現在大學中的壁上，固然貼有壁報，柱上亦差不多常看見標語。一進學校的大門，便覧琳琅滿目。把一個「大學」裝飾得比老式戲院子還要「好看」，眞足令人「啼笑皆非」。久而久之，習為固然。學校當局視若無睹，學生則技術日進，花樣翻新。就這樣一點小小的事情，亦便可以看出一個民族的「文化」了！設使學校對於學生的這種舉動，從開始便加以勸吿，使有一定的限度，常不至有現在的情形。當然，使學生個個都以學問為第一要務，個個都知道自愛而並且肯愛惜學校，亦當不至有這種行為。壁報和標語，實在都無關重要，但學校的風氣是有關重要的！</p>
<p>有人問道：「　報和標語，是學生發表意見或宣傳主義的工具。你不贊成學生做壁報貼標語，豈不是反動？」這個，我倒要分辯一下。學生為要自表達起見，當然可以發表文字。但發表的方法很多，不一定要用色紙貼在壁上。若不得已而必用　報的方式，亦宜由全校學生統籌一妥當的辦法，不至東張西貼，溫無秩序。最重要的，還是做壁　的人，對於所寫的東西，字字句句都要負責任。無論對於私人或對於政府，皆不宣漫駡，依據事實，就事論事，不空說一句話：這是寫壁報的人所應有的態度·若因為他是壁報而就在上邊肆行村婦駡街的伎倆，便是習於下流！這是我們有性靈的學生所應當時刻以自省的。不然，我眞不知道我們現在學校這種風氣要把中國的靑年帶到什麼地方去，要把「中國」帶到什麼地方去。</p>
<p>至於廣吿性質的標語，大學中似不宜有。凡是廣吿性質的東四，多少是有點欺驅的成分的，我們心地純潔的學生，肯犯欺騙同學的罪惡麼？即用標語以宣傳主義，亦是不應當的。同學們置身最高學府。有古今聖賢的書籍可以取鏡，有在校的師長足資諮詢，善善惡惡，是是非非，自己亦應有相當的判斷能力。用標語向同學宣傳任何主義，都是「自視太高而看別人太低」的心理的表現。一個人對同學有這種心理，不是在妄，便是　愚。</p>
<p>總而言之，學校裏風紀的不良，確是現在中國敎育最大的危機。壁報標語，不過是一個例罷了。我們若不把我們國家的運命和整個人類的文化放在心目中，自然亦無所謂敎育的危機。「惟在克念作聖；惟聖罔念作在。」解救中國危機的最大力量，不在政府身上，不在敎書人和靑年學生的身上。</p>

<h3>宴請回敎國代席上　白崇禧致詞</h3>
<p>述召開國大重要意義</p>
<p>〔中央社南京十二日電〕白部長崇禧十二日下午七時宴請伊斯闌敎各國使節及國大代表，席間致詞稱：各位敎親：今天本人以至誠之意，歡宴大家，是表示我對我各伊斯闌致國家駐京使節及全國信仰伊斯闌敎國大代表的一點敬意，藉此機會，以「天下穆民皆為弟兄」的意思，介紹各位代表與各位外賓互相認識，心中至感愉快。</p>
<p>此次國大召開，為中國五千年來歷史上空前盛會，意義非常重大，溯自國民革命軍本國父遺敎及國民黨蔣總裁之領導，於民十七年完成北伐後，即遭日本之妒忌，隨即引起中國對日並對軸心國的抗戰，幸經聯合國共同努力，正義得申，得到完全勝利。中國不幸正在開始建國之際又遭中共匪徒倡亂，國府為解救人民，完成革命大業，明令動員戡亂。但當此共匪猖獗之時，何以必要召開此次國大，完全因國大之召開是國府一貫主張，目的在建立一個三民主義民主的中華民國，故於民國卅五年召開制憲國大，制定憲法，此次依照中華民國憲法召開的首次國大，在中國歷史上是一個劃時代盛會，此次國大開過之後，國民黨當行還政於民，成了眞正民主共和國。</p>
<p>此次國大代表中，有來自國內各地信仰伊斯闌敎的代表計約一百人，占全體代表三十分之一，這是以前任何會議所未有，本人在歡欣之餘，是樂於向我同敎高貴佳賓介紹的。</p>

<p>二時許由高院院長李學燈親自出庭審訊，原吿許芳媛女士以出任息烽縣長業於兩日前赴任，特請曾任建設　記者林濟　女士代表出庭，被吿袁世斌，準時到院候審，態度落落大方。原吿控訴被吿辦理選舉違法，以渠等係由三千人簽署提名參加立委競選，而省選所竟不將渠等姓名副為候選人，似有違法之嫌，且渠等雖為國民黨員，但均已登報脫黨，不愿再受政黨約束。當經被吿袁世斌從容答辯，據稱不將渠等姓名列為候選人，係因時間問題，中央會於二月十六日有令，但以全省各縣定期二月廿一，廿二，廿三日投票，選票旣經全部運送在途，而黔省交通又不方便，通知各縣不易，故未列為候選人。又渠等雖已脫黨，但黨　脫黨，須俟中央批准，在未批准以前，仍應遵守黨紀，故不得列為候選人。當經原被　吿反復辯論，歷二小時之久，最後據被吿袁世斌答稱；此事即使有錯，亦應為總選所及中常會之錯，省選所及本人係奉上行下，省選所及本人均不地負法律方面任何責任。嗣由李院長宣吿：本案尙須充分搜集資料後，再行開審。此一轟動山城之民主官司，遂於五時閉庭。據　威觀察家觀察：女縣長許芳媛旣係本案之重脚，刻因目的已達，官封七品縣太爺，此案發展，不久即可由原吿人撤回，或法院予以不起訴處分，而悄然終結。</p>
<p>額手稱慶　黔人出任主席</p>
<p>貴州近十四五年來，從無本籍人士主主持省政，此次中樞任命本省安順谷正倫先生接任省主席，電訊傳來，全省一千一百萬人民莫不額手稱慶，同聲歡呼。現任黔省主席楊子惠先生，四川廣安人氏，此次調長渝市，中樞認為楊氏夙具建設魄力，以渝市為我國西南重鎭，得此軍事家而兼政治家之人物繼任市長，加以榮陞故里，更必順理成章，勳績懋著。楊氏此次調渝，消息傳來太驟，政院會議決定之前兩日，楊氏知悉已成定局，遂派遣省府設計考核委員會副主任委員兼貴州日報社　向雷峯率領人員一批，專車赴渝辦理接任有關事宜，省市兩府並漏夜趕辦交代。四月二日消息公布之後，當由省黨部，省參議會，高等法院等機關聯名發起籌備省會各界糧送楊主席惠公榮陞大會，定期十日午後假楊氏精心擘劃興建落成不久之市體育館舉行，有隆重儀式，有京川戲劇，並決定在其躬親督修之河濱公園豎立紀念銅像。大會主席團主席包括各界知名人物計共二十五名，晚間公宴設席五十桌，籌備經費預定二千五百萬元，歡送情緒之熱烈隆重，即此可見。楊氏擬於十五日離黔赴渝，日來各方所發起之歡送會，日必七八起，或茶點，或酒席，楊氏每處均必親到，亦必致辭惜別，貴陽人士對楊氏之年來之建設成績靡不頌聲載道，尤以小學敎師學生集會話別時，賓主之間，泣不成聲，最為動人。楊氏在黔銳意建設，本年原定決心將貴陽市貫通南北之中華橫路修為石塊街面，南明河中正大橋改建鋼筋混凝土，興建市中，市東，市南等模範小學新址，並協助修建國立貴陽師範學院，大體均己開工月餘，即將從事建設，而院令調渝，欲罷不能，楊氏對記者發言時，有「倘假以兩年，必可全部成功」之嘆。</p>
<p>鐵血軍人　嗚咽不克畢詞</p>
<p>在一百八十六個工商業同業公會歡送會席上，楊氏致吿別詞時，以一叱咤風雲之鐵血軍人，竟至鳴咽不能畢詞，並尤將行期延至新任谷主席抵筑之後，始行赴渝。據悉，谷氏來黔之期或在月底，筑垣建設，又當可有半月之努力。楊氏在筑之”籍同鄕供職省市機構者，尤為關切備至，刻已決定請由貴州省公路　營處在每日由筑開渝之客車，免費搭　　籍在黔公務員及眷屬四位，並免費携帶三十公斤行李，由貴陽四川同鄕會設處登記。對省市兩府成員三年來努力服務之辛苦，物致慰勞，決將卅六年度省行政經費節餘項下撥發每人黃穀十市石，本年一至三月份公糧黃穀三石，又補足本年一至三月份所預扣之　津一點五，俾為十足發　，巿府職員三月份以前平均不過七八十萬元一月，自昨日調整為一百四五十萬元一月。如此臨別，省巿公務員無論去留，每人均可另有一千餘萬元之收穫，對楊氏之去，更增無限依依之情。</p>

<h3>蘇聯積極展開「神經戰」　交通管制擴至奧境　英佔區至維也納行車受阻　蘇要求美英對閉柏林公路汽車救護站</h3>
<p>〔聯合社柏林十二日電〕蘇聯十日來在德境加强行動，已使柏林可能成為一九四八年之但澤·據外交界耆宿聲稱，蘇聯政策顯以「嘗試錯誤，錯則再試」為基礎，或將陷全世界於另一次大戰。過去十日內，稍具神經質之蘇聯或美國兵士不難發放坊一槍，重演一九一四年奧地利　拉耶伏之慘劇，幸而雙方僵持，並未開槍，局勢得轉平靜。</p>
<p>〔合衆肚柏林十二日電〕蘇聯軍隊十二日在奧境蘇佔區兩條英國應用之公路上，設置檢查站兩處，過去兩週中，蘇聯對付西方國家之神經戰已擴展至維也納矣。蘇聯在奧之行動於十一日開始，英國汽車六輛滿戲軍官，駛至維也納東南五十哩處，擬進入英佔區，以英國拒絕蘇聯主張另換新身份證之要求，蘇軍拒絕汽車通過，乃吿折回。奧境神經戰十二日繼續進行，蘇軍在其境內通往英機塲之國際公路上，設置被查站一處。英火車兩輛被阻於森茂林，英人拒絕出示新身份證，其後卒獲通過，奧境英區高級專員賈洛惠將軍原擬巡視英區，現已取消計劃而　返維也納應付局勢，同時英美參謀部高級軍官在維也納召開緊急會議。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社維也納十一日電〕共黨機關報「人民呼聲報」揭載奧共中央委員會之宣言，並冠以「全體出動五一示威」之大字標題，要求屆時人民應出發示威，要求盟軍立即撤退，取消外國管制及反對延遲簽訂和約。</p>
<p>〔路透社柏林十一日電〕蘇聯當局對於柏林與西德佔領區間之陸上交通，又採取新的限制，要求英美停閉柏林與海姆斯特間通過蘇佔區的汽車大道上之英美汽車修理救護站。在該一百六十公里長之汽車大道上，有英美救護站各一所，相距六十五哩，兩年來素為通過該公路盟方汽車之休憇及修理中心。蘇聯要求停閉時，說明此等修理救護站，祇許在冬季活動。美當局已決定於四月三十日起停閉。淮英方刻仍在考慮答覆中。汽車救護站停閉以後，往來此一人烟稀少的汽車大道上之英美法及其他非蘇方汽車，勢不得不結隊而行，以防中途拋錨呼救無門。</p>
<h3>宛如「東海」中的「西島」　英美區面臨孤立　與柏林交通僅恃空中聯絡</h3>
<p>〔路透社柏林十一日電〕柏林至今日已愈像一在「東」海中的「西」島。蘇聯之拒絕重發英美維持柏林與西方區間電綫的技術人員的通行證，可能使此等電報電話綫，敗壞以至不堪應用。蘇聯之要求英美停閉柏林至西方區間汽車大道上的英美汽車服務站，殆為切斷公路交通之第一步。果爾，西方盟國祗能憑飛機聯絡柏林與西德，然同時亦難保蘇聯之不致採取行動以干涉此一唯一的空中聯絡。　目前柏林對西方佔領區的主要交通狀况概述如下：（一）「鐵道」柏林與西德間之盟方客車於四月一日起即停駛，駛入柏林之貨車尙正常，惟駛出柏林者須有蘇方之特別准許，頗感麻煩。（二）「公路」，至今日為止客車往來尙正常，惟在柏林郊外及佔領區交界處，蘇軍檢查派司頗嚴。英美之汽車服務站一旦廢止，則以全程長達一百九十公里，非機件絕對可靠之汽車當無法往來。（三）「電訊交通」，蘇方已要求英美之電綫維持隊於四月十五日起停止活動，以後柏林與西方佔區甚至國外之電訊交通，將因損壞後無從修理而日趨困難。有綫電交通被阻後，柏林之無綫電設備勢必無法接受此大批電訊。且蘇聯如存心擾亂電訊，對於無綫電之傳遞擾亂必甚容易。（四）「空運」蘇聯至目前為止，尙無干涉空運之徵象。然自柏林發生　機之事後，蘇方可能以維持空中安全為藉口，採取限制塵運之措施。</p>
<h3>挽救人類浩刧　建立世界政府</h3>
<p>美原子科學家委會主張</p>
<p>〔合衆社紐傑賽州普林斯頓十一日電〕愛因斯坦領導下之原子科學家緊急委會十一日要求組織世界政府，以為非此則「吾人之傳統文明必將全盤崩潰」。該會警吿「今日有兩個敵對之世界，正以全力搏賽」。又稱，際此歷史之歧路時期，有三途可循：（一）發動防止性戰爭。「在美國獨具原子彈之際，吾人主動選擇時間地點，攻擊潛在之敵人」。（二）維持兩集團世界間之武裝和平。「然歷史上此情形永遠導致戰爭」。（三）世界政府。委員稱，由於危機之迫在眉睫，應立即採取積極行動，而間接督促杜魯門總統與史達林舉行會議。—必要時秘密會議愛因斯坦於該會文吿頒佈後，吿訪員稱，美國不必放棄原子能知識及原子彈之壟斷。</p>
<h3>昂山等舉行國葬</h3>
<p>〔聯合社仰光十一日電〕緬甸總理昻山及閣員八人，於去年七月被　毅，今白國　大金　　　，全市均下半旗慈哀，柩車所過之處，居民俯首向之致最後敬總者十萬人以上。昻山之夫人及子女隨柩送殯。現任總理牛泰眞與外交團人員則先到墓地迎候。昻山七十六歲之老母，目送送那行列經過，老淚盈眶。牛泰眞致輓詞稱，全國決心奉行故總理之遺志，為和平與團結奮鬥。故總理之犧牲已使緬甸獲得自由。</p>

<h3>義競遷如火如茶　全國昨晨總罷工一小時</h3>
<p>〔聯合社羅馬十二日電〕共黨領導之總工會下令自今晨十時起實行全國總罷工一小時，以抗議兩年來西西里工會領袖卅五人之遇害，電話。電車。公共汽車及商業均吿停頓，僅鐵路工人與消防隊員未受影響。</p>
<p>〔路透社羅馬十一日電〕義大利之競選運動，至普選前最後一個星期日的今天已達如火如荼的程度。北起阿爾卑斯山南迄西西里之南端，均有政治集會之召開。</p>
<p>共黨控制的人民陳綫昨曾發表宣言保證將使義大利避免參加以戰爭為目的之任何集團。人民陣綫前此亦曾呼籲勿可於選舉後舉行示威運動，因此觀察家相信人民陳綫今已感獲勝之缺乏把握。加斯貝利總理昨曾在比薩演說，鄭重表示：「余敢向各位保證，選舉以後，余決不逃亡或以武力保持權力，義大利決非巴爾幹國家。」中間及右翼報紙均以蘇聯在安理會中否決義大利加入聯合國之聲請為大標題，作為反共派的宣傳資料。米蘭大敎堂廣塲上有盛大集會，米蘭全省之數萬親共份子手持義國旗及紅旗，聆取義共領袖托格里亞蒂的演說。加斯貝利今日又在沙鳳那發表演說，他說，蘇聯在戰時亦曾接受美國的援助，故義大利今日接受美援，亦不致防礙其獨立。</p>

<h3>哥國與蘇聯絕交　逮捕叛亂人員中有蘇人二名　泛美會決續在哥京會議</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕紐約十二日廣播：波哥大訊，今日出席泛美會議各國代表預定召開會議，以便決定今後繼續舉行大會之日期與地點。大會是否能在波哥大續開，頗成問題。波哥大經暴動後，損失奇重，所有較大房　，均遭焚觀，估計非五年之時間，不能恢復舊觀。在　動期間，共產黨確參與其事，惟大部份之死傷，均係於貧苦　衆在刦時發生。</p>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓十二日電〕美國務院接獲電訊，悉哥倫比亞政府電臺於十二日宣佈，哥倫比亞業已斷絕與蘇聯之外交關係。絕交事適在十一日宣佈，蘇聯工作人員兩名因涉及波哥大之叛動而被捕一事之後。哥政府電台稱，外國人員十五人，內蘇人兩人，「當塲」被查獲，數人且被生擒。又稱，外國人員三人在製造不安時被捕。</p>

<p>〔聯合社哥倫比亞京城十二日電〕哥倫比亞總統具萊士十二日在國民電台廣播稱，共黨叛亂已由軍隊平定，城內暴動已止。政府指斥共產黨主使謀殺自由黨領袖蓋丹，及以後之焚殺劫掠，惟馬歇爾領導之美國代表團，尙未能斷定共產黨及莫斯科指導之外國間諜，參加此次叛亂至何種程度。共產黨操縱之工聯會，實為哥倫比亞工界之主要份子。共產黨曾秘密散發傳單，斥責總統墓仿希特勒戰術，並勸工人繼續總罷工，以表示抵抗反動及美帝國主義。</p>
<p>〔聯合社哥倫比亞京城十二日電〕泛美會議各國代表昨夜決定，仍在此處繼續開會，至不可能時始易地。會後並發表聲明稱，「美洲各國第九屆國際會議各國代表茲重行認識美洲各國人民民立的團結及其在和平中共同歷史的使命，貢獻於人類之進步與幸福。關係各國不能因其中任何一國臨時發生變故而動搖其信念，爰乃決定繼續其重要事功，以完成關係各國政府之付托。」</p>

<h3>倫敦廣塲萬衆爭觀典禮　羅斯福銅像揭幕　一代偉人永留世人回憶</h3>
<p>〔路透社倫敦十二日電〕建於倫敦格落斯佛納廣塲之罷斯福銅像，已於十二日羅斯福逝世三週年日由羅斯福夫人親自舉行揭幕禮。像係狄克爵士手製，較羅斯福故總統本人尤大。在塲參與典禮者有英王英后·伊麗莎白公主與夫愛丁堡公爵·艾德禮首相·戰時苜相邱吉爾·其他戰時領袖·及美陸戰隊暨英國皇家陸戰隊。英王致短辭，稱譽故羅斯福為和平的偉人及世界偉大的公民·並稱，此一紀念鋼像在以後永久的年代內，將為英美兩國人民在戰爭黑暗時期同為伙伴的永久回憶。典禮開始之前，格洛斯佛納廣塲週圍已圍滿六七層厚之觀衆，四週窗戶及陽台上亦多為人佔領。當羅斯福夫入步登階石時，全塲寂然無聲。祗見夫人手拉繩索，白幔落下，偉大之銅像出現於大衆之前，時號角齊嗚，觀衆掌聲雷動。夫人旋偕英王英后同車返宮。美大使陶格拉斯亦致短辭，謂此一銅像乃英美合作之標誌，人類史上實無如此完全和諧而成功的國際合作。此乃戰時兩大巨匠邱吉爾與羅斯福之手作。</p>

<p>〔聯合社成功湖十一日電〕驟合國機構代管巴勒斯坦之希望已趨渺茫，各國代表在會外討論，上星期一美方提案所列十項辦法，迄今一無結果。某某數國代表及聯合國機構秘書處高級職員聞已承認代管已不足以代替分治，解決聖地問題。美國首席代表奧斯汀鑒於此種僵局，現擬再加修正，俾能為安理會聯大特會接受。</p>
<h3>陳納德將軍　論美國對華政策</h3>
<p>克里浦斯霍華特系報業聯合會版權所有</p>
<p>本報編譯室譯</p>
<p>（十七）遇事猶豫貽誤戎機</p>
<p>當中緬印戰區司令史迪威將軍於一九四四年最後承認中國的軍事危機之時，他在協力挽救美國在中國東部的空軍根據地和不以供應品予中國的保衛者藉以羞辱中國政府之間，猶豫不決。他在兩種辦法方面都沒有處理得好。</p>
<p>當一九四四年六月他最後認可我所提的增加空軍供應的要求之時，我指出了用B—二九型機進攻日軍在湖南方面攻勢的主要根據地漢口的必要。我力促儘速實行，甚至把它當做超空堡壘的第一任務，雖然它們預定的工作是從中國西部的前進根據地開始長距離轟炸。</p>
<p>六月六日在我司令部中所舉行的一次會議席上，史迪威對於這個建議一半表示接受。我的意思是說，第十四航空隊將追隨超空堡壘進行攻擊，以全部力量對付敵人，協力去擊破日軍的根據地，並且帮助中國軍隊在湖南組織有效的防衛。</p>
<p>當我建議B二九型直接採取行動時，史迪威說他將在他的緬甸司令部去處理這椿事情。</p>
<p>他的確向華盛頓請過示，但是他這種辦法並不能表示除了向華府請示之外，別無其他途徑可以使事情從速辦理。事實上B—二九型並沒有轟炸漢口，直到六個月之後，那時候日軍已經由中國東部開闢了一條大陸走廊了。後來B—二九型機的轟炸縱使很成功，也不過是亡羊補牢而已。</p>
<p>但是史迪威的確於六月八日宣佈緊急狀態已存在於中國。在那時，就得動員幾乎是中風方面全部可以動用的供應和運輸工具。但是，由於中國內部的運輸久被忽視，尤其是從駝峯空運終點昆明到湖南省內空軍根據地這條交通綫的失修，這最後一刻的努力也失却了效能。</p>
<p>職是之故，從印度的第七轟炸大隊方面派遣B—二四型把燃料向東裝運，已成必要。大量的汽油就消耗在空運方面，而事實上假如陸上的運輸有辦法的話，這些汽油是可以用於作戰方面以應付日軍的攻勢的</p>
<p>向東的交通綫之不能維持，致使我們不得不把我們在中國東部的少數中型轟炸機實行撤退，而使戰鬥機的活動限於空軍基地的防禦方面，雖然那時候—從七月二十三日至八月八日—正是衡陽之戰達到最高峯，急需空軍的支持，而也是唯有空軍的支持，或許可以挽救這個軍略中心的時候。</p>
<p>在衡陽被圍的第一日，我建議把第十四航空隊的輕便自動武器和若千種步兵武器一千噸給予薛岳將軍。我確信假如能把小量的援助給他，他是會繼續作戰下去的。</p>
<p>戰區司令部愼重地把這個建議加以考慮。於是史迪威承認有採取激烈行動的必要，但是他的意思是想接管中國軍隊的指揮權。</p>
<p>根據重慶方面的消息，史迪威拒絕了我的建議。戰區司令部相當隱諱地發出了一個消息，說是史迪威正在草擬一個「建議」，這個建議將羞辱中央政府，並且表示在他的建議被接受之前，他不願意中國東部的地上部隊。</p>
<p>同時，在重慶的戰區司令部方面的負責官員，開始隨便談論一點，說第十四航空隊負責着保衛中國的東部而不得到中國人的帮助，而當時危機就是這樣造成的。</p>
<p>這種隨便的談論完全忽視了我已往所提警吿和請求的記錄。此外，戰區司令部方面人士在重慶英大使館的一次宴會席上，又隨便談論中國方面「撒退戰時首都的計劃」。有一個健談的美國軍官曾經猜測中國政府是否將遷入中國內地或者遷到新德里去。</p>
<p>在七月下半月，當衡陽遠在英勇抵抗的時候，我要求派運兵飛機把軍火和醫藥供應品投擲給衡陽的守軍，以應他們屢次提出的請求。史迪威在答覆這個要求的時候，把他已往對中國及其因難處境的態度，總結地說了一遍。他說從空中投擲供應品的結果，將引起投擲更多供應品的要求，無法予以滿足，所以他不願意供給飛機。</p>
<p>七月下旬，戰區司令部的態度，以為中國東部是經失却了，官方曾經這樣表示過。戰區司令部方面不顧它未以物質援助給予中國東部的軍隊及其忽視陸上運輸以至空中運輸的事實，以為再度對中國方面實行「威脅，請求，譴責以及不客氣對待」的時刻已經到臨了。但是縱使要做這種事情的時間，也已經沒有。</p>
<p>戰區司令部曾想從九月份起把從陸路運赴中國東部供應品增至每月六千噸。假如能够早一點就這樣做，日軍的攻勢是可以加以阻抑的。但是這個問題已經遷延得太久了。</p>
<p>中國東部終吿失却。</p>
<h3>許曼總理說明　法對德政策　反對高度集權制</h3>
<p>〔路透社巴黎十一日電〕許曼總理十一日向塞納奧亞賽省人民共和黨大會致辭，表示法政府贊成成立三區合併後之西德政府，但法國仍主張在此一政府下每邦仍應享有强度的自治權。許曼說，法政府政策的主要特性，乃為適合現實，因此法國已表示願意協助設立一個堪為和平主要因素的國際組織。然法國將為此一政策的生動者之一，不擬僅事唱和。就德國問題而言，必須區別現在與將來的問題，以及過渡性與肯定性的解決辦法。在覓取德國新組織之際，必須勿忘德國諸邦的存在，不可使其成為高度集權的一個國家。蓋德國諸邦在地理上及種族上原有差別，而高度集權的統一德國，亦往往造成極權性的政權。」許曼繼曰，法國希望保留對德的權利，繼續留在柏林，要求合理的賠償及適當的安全保障。如果四强不獲成立協議，則法國將為其他三强中之一份子，法國不欲有互相敵視的集團，但法國認為解決辦法，無論如何必須能够獲得。</p>

<h3>日用品配給制　小組會議原則決定　暫定加配八種　委託工廠製造　成立審議會辦理購配事宜</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕社會局為穩定生活指數，建議由各工廠合作配售職工日用必需品，經成立生活指數編制問題研究會，於上週召集各有關日用必需品同業公會談話後組織日用必需品配給制小組。昨日下午三時，該小組會在社會局召開第一次會議，出席社會局經濟行政處長　炳元，勞工處長沈鼎，第三科長鄒今揆，曁市商會，工業協會，六區棉紡公會，肥皂業，染織業，內衣業，針織業，樹柴業，上海市合作社聯合社代表十餘人等。決定原則，就編制生活指數規定之日用必需品種類及數量，按其需要，採用定貨方式，委托工廠製造後配售予職工。配售物品種類除政府原有配給之米，油，糖，煤球外，暫定加配布，（分壤布及色布），食鹽，醬油，木柴，火柴，襪子，紙烟，肥皂等物。配售數量依編製生活指數規定之量數及權數為原則。為辦理購配事宜，小組會決定成立日用必需品購配審議委員會，其任務為：（一）審核製造廠家是否符合條件。（二）鑑定成品是否合乎標準。（三）審核日用品之價格。委員會之組織由社會局，民食調配會，中央銀行，中央信託局，中央合作金庫，工業協會，市商會及日用必需品有關同業公會參加。詳細辦法定本月二十日下午再行開會討論。</p>
<p>依指數計薪職工　均有配購權利</p>
<p>據社會局長吳開先對記者談：本市凡依生活指數計薪之職工，將來均有配售權利。至無生產品可供配售之商號，其職工仍當依配售物品編製之生活指數計薪，驟視之，雖似祗享權利，不盡義務，但如從大處着眼，各商號因開支節省，貨品賣出較為便宜，一般市民亦可蒙受其利。故此非僅廠方及職工之問題，亦為有關全市市民之問題，至如水泥廠等亦無日用必需產品可供配售，但如製造日用必須品工廠建屋需用水泥時，該水泥廠應予便宜。總之事關全體，須相互合作。社會局待購配詳細辦法決定後，將召集全市所有工業同業公會談話，協商規定應盡義務，以求互助合作。至言由政府配售製造原料事，茲事體大，社會局無法辦理。</p>

<p>當出事之晚，死者家屬尙未得息，迨至次晨，唐閱讀本報後始悉此事。蓋丁琴芳於出事前一一白，適離家作客於福煦路福明邨四十九號其胞姊處，是日晚正擬懷抱小孩坐車返家，不意經過太平花園對過時，竟遭此不幸，惟丁於遇難時，其懷抱小孩雖同時倒地，尙幸無恙。記者昨晚訪問害寓時，目睹此一死裏逃生之幼孩，雖在其祖母百般撫慰之中，尙啼呌媽媽不己，而一家老小，更沉浸於悲凉凄苦之氣氛中，令人為之不勝同情悲憤也。</p>
<p>據警局方面調查：出事之晚，當時有三輛無軌電車由北朝南行駛，而同時有三輪車三輛由南朝北而行，傳聞死者所坐為其中之第二輛，據一般推測，肇禍之無軌電車可能為廿四路。</p>
<p>據唐達人語記者：希望是日搭　無軌　事之　　，及當時目睹慘　發生之在塲人士，能仗　出而證明眞相，以慰死者，並謂該肇事司機及三輪車駕駛人至今迄未弋獲，更望警局加緊緝捕，不使肇禍者逍遙法外。</p>

<h3>嚴培興夫婦糾紛　地院民庭昨傳訊　　究竟瘋不瘋　法官亦難斷　且待訊問兩位醫師</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕「瘋人之謎」男主角嚴培興，與其妻袁寳英間之糾紛，昨日首次在地院民庭開審。袁控嚴心神喪失與精神耗弱，聲請法院宣吿禁治產·嚴昨晨到庭時，新理髮，面色紅潤。袁寳英梳髻，面色黃瘦，有金牙三粒，着黑綢旗袍，小脚。雙方各延律師三人到庭辯護。原吿方面先將大幅龍岡一面懸於法庭牆上，圖為藍底，右上角白粉繪成太陽一，十道光綫，下為白粉繪成之巨龍，上書「天龍主大眞正」，旁署「房毅」。昨日聞訊前往旁聽者甚衆，狹小之民十一庭有人滿之患。</p>
<p>提出證據八件</p>
<p>何憲章推事首訊袁寳英，袁操純粹無錫土白，急促而無次序，陳述至半，忽掩面大哭。稱小夫妻空手由無錫出來，二十六年創設華興紡織五金廠，二十九年創生大廠，去年創興業鋼絲綜廠，因其夫時發神經病，不能管理廠務，虧蝕甚巨，故報吿警局，送入普慈醫院精神病院為其治療。幷由李謨律師提出怪異之照片文件等證據八件·幷加說明：「第一件至第五件，可證明嚴培興之精神錯亂，第六件至第八件可證明嚴不能處理事務，故依照民法第十四條之規定，法院得因其本人配偶或最近親馬二人之申請，宣吿禁治產。」</p>
<p>將手銬起打針</p>
<p>嗣傳嚴培興訊問，此一大衆注目之「瘋人」，侃侃陳述，能度至為安詳。答辯亦極有條理，稱被軍人模樣之人綁至車中，前面尙有小汽車一部前導，駛至普慈醫院，强指為瘋人，將手銬起，幷打麻醉針，囚於院中四十多天，後來我苦苦哀求，黃姓醫師伸出兩隻手，要十億元，我說沒有這許多現鈔，伸出一隻手還價五億元，結果允許我對外通信，寫了一信與無錫鄕間胞妹，由警備司令部鄭重為處長救出，出院後請公濟醫院精神病權威韓醫師檢查，證明幷無精神病狀態，當庭幷將韓醫師證明書呈上。</p>
<p>一一加以答辯</p>
<p>嗣述華興·生大·興業三廠，均係獨資獨力經營處理，對於禁治產中「不能處理自己事務」要件亦有未符。對原吿所提證件亦一一答辯：（一）其妻袁寳英膜拜照片係袁勸其拍攝，作為重歸於好紀念，（二）手令係關房　　，（三）天龍係作商標之用。被吿辦護律師周孝　起立稱：被吿經庭上一小時之訊問，其答辯程序井然，亳無精神病狀態，其　袁　英將歷次遊戲筆墨均珍重　起，可見蓄意已久，純出惡意，此案幕後係一有組織有計劃之謀財　產險謀，至為明顯。庭上以此案尙頻傳普慈醫院黃英邦醫師及公濟醫院韓醫師訊問，改期續審。</p>

<h3>同濟學潮案審結　學生以畢業近期請早解決　庭論一律還押十六宣判</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕同濟大學學潮，被控毆辱吳市長一案，地院昨晨九時開庭審理，迄中午一時許辯論終結，定十六日上午宣判。　昨日地院門前戒備森嚴，保警一中隊曁全體法警均出動警戒，入內須憑旁聽證，惟各校學生昨未結隊前往，旁聽者亦不及上次之多，故秩序異常良好。九時胡之超推事偕顧瑞麟檢察官升座刑二庭，飭提被吿黃克魯，潘承邦，馮立文，王忠恕，王維新（前排），張敬堯，熊宗烈，王公衛，周詠之，孫克　，瞿宇平（後排）到案；曾傳證人張聚恭，江鴻，朱惠如，劉爽秋，則僅到張聚恭一人。胡推事略予訊問後，即由顧檢察官起立論吿，略謂各被吿均係靑年學生，無大惡性，請從輕發落。繼由各被吿開始辯論，黃克魯辯稱：「學生自治會人員係代表同學意見，執行大會決議，無　動故意。」潘承邦否認毆打市長，馮立文稱：「自治會人員　由下而上推選出來，請願係同學公意，幷無煽動情形。　　　恕稱：　黃馬之　　見相同。王維新稱：一不是自治會人員，晋京請願團總指揮係臨時推出，由　　序而已，未發出前進命令。」至此，市畏副官張聚恭怱忽到庭作證，首先指出馮立文，潘承邦，王維新，瞿宇平，孫克孖五被吿當時在塲，指至瞿宇平時，曾脫口將　名叫出，因瞿將眼銳卸下，張不敢確定，又指王維新為瞿，當時瞿之辯護律師俞承修起立追問：「究竟何人是瞿宇平」？張終誤指正為瞿，繼稱：「因時隔二月，已記不淸楚，僅可證明此五人均在塲，至於何人　手毆打，則不敢武斷證明。我與警局督察朱一夫始終在一起保護呉市長。」至此，續行辯論，張敬堯稱；「所持者是第于三大隊隊旗，不是請願團旗。」熊宗烈稱：「未參加請願幽，未呼口號，現距離畢業只有兩個月，請早日解決。」王公衛稱：「已被學校開除，並在押兩月餘，據證人證明被吿不在塲，所有一切學業上精神上損失請求賠償。」周詠之否認毆打市長，孫克孖稱：「是聖約翰大學學生，因有約大同學王振禮被捕，向吳市長提起質問，吳市長已允釋放，此時警局馬隊忽然衝來，秩序大亂，我因身體不好，閃避一旁，根本無毆打市長之事。」瞿宇平稱：「旣無打市長動機，亦無打市長行動，」各被吿辯論畢，被吿律師復起立辯護，　處諭本案十六日宣判。各被吿當庭請求交保不准，仍予還押。</p>

<h3>棉紗由疲轉堅　布疋起伏狹窄交易清淡</h3>
<p>昨日紗市，由疲而堅，結果互見參差。初開因客帮納胃呆滯，本帮亦呈觀望，因此各級均以低檔開發。四二支藍鳳晨開為二億二千七百萬，廿一支　馬自一億四千七百萬開出，奈以實銷不暢；空方亦乘機拋售，市價漸吿盤低。前者低見二億二千四百萬，迨至臨收，利買消息頻傳，空方心虛，紛起補進，市價重見向榮。終以二億三千二百萬收市，較上週末續升二百萬，後者為一億五千萬結束，亦堅二百萬。四十支除藍鳳軋升二百萬外，餘均入疲途徘徊。二十支除雙馬及大飛艇軋跌，餘均普升一百萬至五百萬不等。</p>
<p>棉布市况，昨起伏狹窄，交易淸淡，客帮進胃甚稀，布商相繼套利，染廠進意淡然，僅屬散戶逢低有納，臨收利買消息頻傳，頗形穩挺。十二磅龍頭細布，晨開為四八五萬元，一度低達四八二萬元，散戶有進，為四八四萬元收市。週六紡建公司供售細布，及元嗶嘰准貨單，一致倒貼五萬元。</p>

<h3>杭州新龍井到滬</h3>
<p>每斤開價一百六十萬元</p>
<p>查同菐間鵠候多日之本年度杭州龍井，昨市已有百來斤蒞滬報新，做開價格，登峯造極，每斤竟達一百六十萬元光景，惟底盤決難站住。推厥原因，目前各方為搶新起見，一致不惜高價，而嗣後到源增多，難免直綫下瀉。至於陳貨花色，執主仍因貨稀圖守，故內銷茶問津者多觀望不前。他若外銷茶，海外雖需求尙亟，然出口商態度猶豫，形勢進出兩稀，交易大為减色，惟市氣則巍站如昔。</p>
<p>又訊：自農民銀行舉辦茶貸以來，茶商莫不得益匪淺，而目前又屆茶汎，故連日該業中人，需款頻殷，並希望依照去年辦法，迅速進行，俾資不妨本年度茶葉產銷。</p>
<h3>產地報小賣氣濃厚食米重入疲途　特高粳退進四百萬大關</h3>
<p>米市續見疲港，晨開貨主以隔日錫價報小，售意甚濃，市續上週之疲勢而再下墜。復因本街納胃微小，去路至感不暢，後市更露虛象。南市塲白粳及薄稻各跌十萬元，早稻小五萬至十萬。陰百元供應較少，市吿站定。糙秈米獨支持平定。北市塲除高白粳獨定外，餘均挫五萬元。特高粳退入四百萬大關，昨日南北二市到貨共計六千七百五十二石。</p>
<p>麵粉</p>

<p>學津學術與民主  謝幼偉　　　國民大會正在開會，謀奠定我國民主基礎的時候，我們談學術的人，似乎有出來說幾句話的必要。對於這一次的大會，不管我們滿意或不滿意，至低限度，形式上這是民主政治的表現。我們當本學術求眞的精神，不爲黨見或偏見所左右的精神，去認識這一次大會的意義，去努力爲我國民主立其不拔之基。　　學術界中人富於理想。富於理想的人，多不滿現實。由不滿意當前的現實政治，我們很容易把這種不滿意的情緒轉移到這一次的大會上去。這是很自然的，不足為奇的·不過，我們要知道，學術思想和民主政治，是互爲因果，也是互相需要的。沒有適宜於民主政治發隧的學術思想，則民主政治不易發生，不易長成，也不易達乎理想。反之，沒有適宜於學術思想發展的民主政治爲其環境，則學術思想也沒有發揚光大的可能。作者願就這兩點，略發其幾，以告國人。　　在現代民主政治的國家中，最成功的，莫如薑　·英國民主政治之所以成功，決不楚一朝一夕之事，而是和英國的學術思想有密切關係的。有英國的學術，才有英國的民主。爲英國的民主政治奠共理論上的基礎的，就是英國的學術。沒有洛克，休謨諸人的經驗諭，沒有邊沁，穆勒諸人的功利諭，沒有格林，柏烈得萊諸人的新唯心論，不會有今日英國的民主，至低限度，不會有今日這樣的成功。蓋民主政治所側重的是個人的平等，個人的自由，個人充分而完全的發展。換一句話，就是個人主義。民主政治可以說即是個人主義的政治。忽視個人，抹煞個人，便無民主政治可言。英國的經驗論和功利諭，固是以個人主義爲根本，即英國的新唯心論也是以個人主義爲根本。特前者所謂個人，乃分離獨立的個人，後者所謂個人，則爲和團體不能分離的個人。由經驗和功利論出發爲自由主義，爲資本主義；由新唯心論出發，亦爲自由主義，特個人自由不能不略受團體的限制，不能不顧及全體的福利，這樣資本主義便不能以自由爲藉口，而須受國家的統制。英國的民主政治，所以能由偏重政治的民主而轉到兼重經濟的民主，這可說就是新唯心諭的功勞。經驗論和功利諭爲英國奠定政治民主的基礎，而新唯心論則爲英國奠定經濟民主的基礎。這不是學術有助於民主的明證嗎？　　反過來，不是英國民主政治的環境，也不會有英國的學術，不會有這樣豐富而光輝的學術。學術的發展，最主要的條件是自由，是思想家的思想自由。沒有思想自由，即無學術可言。規定了某一種思想，而只讓思想家在這一思想系統下去思想，道也不是思想自由。任何思想系統或任何學說，都是思想家思想的對象。其是其非，只有經過思想家的思索，才能決定。萬不能不經過思想家的思索，即把一種思想系統强迫思想家接受。這是思想統制，是思想的自殺，而決不是思想自由。　學術思想的發展，思想家必須有思索任何思想系统的自由。雖我們通常認爲不正確而有害的思想，在某一限度內，也應常讓思想家有思索的自由。例如，黑格爾和馬克思的學說，有人認爲是反民主的，是謬誤而有害的·可是在英國民主政治的環境下，馬克思却可在倫敦自由完成其資本論，而黑格爾也可以在英國被研究，受歡迎·英國政府這樣做，英國沒有赤化，也沒有成爲獨裁，却反而養成了許多有學間，有思想的學者。假如，英國不是民主，而是獨裁，像法西斯一樣的獨裁，則馬克思或當被逐，黑格爾的著作也會被禁止流行，這樣英國許多有名的學者，如格林，如柏烈得萊，如羅素，如拉斯基等，都有不會出現的可能。這豈不是民主有助於學術的明證嗎？　　爲此，作者希望於學術界的是，努力發揚及培養有關民主的學術思想；希望於國大代表及一般政府人物的是，努力迭成便利學術發展的環境。目前的環境，無法談學術。學術界苦於生事，救死不遑，奚暇治學問？不過，不談學術，而空談民主，則民主也是空的。亞里士多德的思想性質  嚴羣　　亞里士多德的思想的性質，有兩方面值得注意：　　（一）承繼柏拉圖方面·—所謂承繼，並不像沒出息的子孫承祖業，自己不會經營，只要保守母失，便算盡了責任。亞氏之承繼柏氏，不但能消化所承繼的部分，並且自已發展起來。他深信宇宙一切現象必須變爲槪念才能成知識，這是他消化所承繼的部分。同時他也感覺到柏氏的缺陷，這缺陷是柏氏所應做而未做的事業。以前蘇格拉底發見求槪念的須要，以爲這是知識的眞正法門；但是他畢竟是　創的人，膽子還不够大，所以只劃人事界一隅做研究的範圍。柏氏見到這個缺點，便想推廣到全宇宙，可是他的貢獻止於發見宇宙一切都有槪念（他叫做理型—ldesa）。須知求槪念的原意在得知識，知識無非　於茫茫的現象下解釋，那麼求槪念就是要解釋那些現　。柏氏旣知道槪念所能解釋的範圍不只是人事界一隅，其用用能及字宙一切，可是他只是見到，不曾實際去做。於此亞氏的貢獻來了，他覺得柏氏的缺點在此，所未盡的事業也在此，因此他便負起這責任，實行用槪念解釋宇宙一切。這樣一做，便替科學開了門戶，奠好根基。過是他襲取柏氏的領土，自己加以開拓的成績。　　（二）自己創造方面。—方才說，亞氏的　目在憤行用槪念去解釋字宙一切；　竟如何解釋？答復這問題，可分兩方面：（一）方法方面。—柏氏爲學的方法是辯證法，辯證法的形式是問答，內容是分析與綜合，其實是雛形的歸納與演繹。亞氏把這方法發揚光大，蔚爲專門的方法論，叫做　輯。這是他創造的第一步。但是他還不滿意。他以爲邏輯不够，還得加上實際的觀察，才能有新的發見。雖然因爲時代的限制，他還不能用到現代科學家所常用的實驗法，不能在統制的環境之下彙集材料與事實，只好在散漫的自然環境之中觀察，但是只此已替後世的科學方法建了堅固不拔的基礎·這是他創造的第二步·（二）內容方面·—柏氏發見宇宙萬物都有概念之後，便把概念歸到另一世界，與實際自然界成對峙之勢。亞氏不以爲然，他以爲槪念的功用本來在解釋現象，現在反而把它與現象隔開，二者判若鴻溝，這豈不是等於無用，豈不是同沒有解釋一樣？於是他把概念拉到自然界來，呌它們切切實實地解釋自然界。他決不相信有獨立自在，另成一界的理型，同時又堅信宇宙萬物用槪念來解釋；他以爲有概念而無事實，這槪念是空虛的，有事實而無槪念，這事實是沒有意義的。這就是他最大的實獻，因爲這替科學找出路，替哲學找用途。　　總結以上兩點，可見亞氏的哲學一方面是理性主義，一方面是經驗主義。前者是他承繼柏氏的部分，後者是他自己創迭的部分。經驗主義是他的手段，理性主義是他的目的。這才是一科學的眞諦。科學家一不是只在屋裏用理性一解釋字宙，他一舉一動必須根據經驗上所得的事實·可是大家往往以爲科學家只是描寫，不曾解釋，因此他所得的只是經　上的事實。其實這樣看法錯了。科學家何嘗不解釋，不過他听解釋的現象只是局部的，所解釋的理由不是最後的，如此而已叔本華的藝術論  少雄　　　　十九世紀德哲叔本華（ArthurSchopenhauer）是對於藝術很有研究的哲人。在他的哲學理諭裏，藝術佔了一個很重要的位置。根據他的哲學，他是要否定生命，否定生之意志的，而他認爲藝術就是一種否定生之意志的方法，雖然不是根本的方法。在藝術裏，我們可以暫時忘掉生之意志，可以暫時護得解脫，獲得超越。這是叔氏重視藝術的主要理由。本文沒有詳述叔氏藝術諭的企圖，而只是在叔氏諭文集裏一篇「純藝術的玄學」一文，握要的譯述出來，使一般　者可對叔氏的藝術論獲得多少根本的槪念。　　在上述的一篇論文裏，叔氏認爲藝術哲學的眞正問題是；對於和意志（或欲求）沒有任何關係的事物，而可獲得快樂，是怎樣可能的？一般人都知道，只有當一物和我們的意志或欲求發生關係，或當一物滿足了我們的目的時，我們才能對這一物發生快樂和享受。所以要對和意志沒有任何關係的事物獲得快樂，這似乎是矛盾的。不過，很明顯的是，我們又實從美的本身獲得了快樂和享受，而這是和我們個人目的，或我們的意志，極無關係的。　　如上的矛盾，叔氏提出了他的解決方法。他認爲所　美，乃是有生命及無生命的自然的根本而原始的形式，用柏拉圖的話說來，就是理型（ldeas）。我們要認識美，認識理型，不是普通的感覺，普通的機能，所可認識的，而只能由免除了意志束縛的知的主體，換一句話，只能由不具目的，不涉欲求的純粹智力去認識。所以在美的知覺行爲中，意志是在意識內絕對沒有地位的。可是只有意志是我們一切悲哀和痛苦的泉源，若意志在意識內消滅了，豈不是全部痛苦的可能性也消滅了嗎？這就是在美的知覺中可以有快樂之感相隨的理由。設有人謂，如痛苦的可能性除去，則快樂的可能性也除去，這又如何能得快樂？叔氏的回答是，快樂的性質是消極的，快樂只是免除痛苦的別名，唯有痛苦才是生存上積極的原素。因而當意志在意識內消滅時，這不僅除去痛苦，也除去了痛苦的可能性，所留存下來的，便是事受的狀態，快樂的狀態。　　所　純粹智力，其意義就是解脫了一人的自我的束縛。我們要獲有純粹智力，我們得忘記一人自身的目的，而完全沉沒於對象的觀賞中；使我們所意識到的一切，只是這一個對象。例如，當我們欣賞一朶美麗的梅花時，我們忘記了自我，忘記了一切，而只是這一朶梅花在意識中。像這樣一種纏能，　不是多數人所能有的，也照例不適宜於應付人問世的要求的，然而藝術的機能，即由這種機能構成。　　普通入的智力，是爲意志而存在，爲意志而工作，供意志之所鞭策的智力。這種智力在使意志白覺及覺到其周圍的事物，在聽命於意志，在滿足意志的要求。所以這種智力不易知覺到美。但假定暫時意志把智力釋放，讓智力自由，使智力不必去做意志的工作，不必做其日常生活的工作，則這樣釋放後的智力，便成爲純粹的智力。不過，這樣釋放後的智力，雖免除了意志的工作，却不是不工作，不活動，不努力的智力。這種純粹智力，仍是活動而努力的，這一點即說明了爲什麼藝術上的創作這樣稀少的理由。蓋普通人的智力都是要受意志的鞭策才活動的。我們的思想，我們的努力，我們見和聞的能力，直接或間接，都是爲着我們個人大大小小的目的而服役。我們的智力爲受意志的驅迪才活動的。假如這種驅迫撤消了，我們的智力也可因此而停止活動，停止工作。一般人就是如此。藝術家則不然。藝術家的智力，雖免除了意志的驅迫，却依然保持其活動。藝術家的智力，免除了意志的糾經後，一方面牠可以客觀地觀察字宙，忠實地反映人生，另一方面牠可以運用原理和方法去選擇題材一及其表現的方式。如畫家之於繪畫及運用顏色的準確，如詩人之選擇適當的語句及韻律，這些都是智力的活動。以故，藝術家的機能，其智力是純粹的，是自由的，也是活動的，不爲意志服役，却又有其活動一的目標。（未完）學林叢話（七十）  張其昀　　國民性與教育　　　　　中國傳統的敎育思想，便是儒家的六藝之敎。六藝曰禮樂射御書數，其中禮樂二項尤爲六藝的中心觀念。孔子曰，一禮云禮云，玉帛云乎哉。樂云樂云，鐘鼓云乎哉」。儒家論禮樂，當然以精神遠比跡象爲重要。樂所代表的是人與人的同情心，禮所代表的是各個人的分際。樂是人情所不能已者，禮是倫理之所不易者。樂記有云，「樂者爲同，禮者爲異，同則相親，異則相敬」。周禮說，「以禮敎中，以樂敎和。」（卷三地官上），儒家思想一面注重內心的和平，是即相同相親之處，一面注重外表的條理，是即相異相敬之處。樂的精神是和諧，禮的精神是秩序，相　相成，缺一不可。究全的人格和理想的社會必須兼備禮樂之教，合乎情而當於理，才算是盡善盡美。　　儒家思想在禮與樂之中，特別着車樂教，視爲敎育上的核心。周禮稱一大司樂　成均之法，以治建國之學政，而合國之子弟焉」。（卷六春官下）成均就是大學，爲何大學之法掌於樂官呢？因爲儒家以仁字總攝一切德行，樂興仁是一體，能從血脈上去感動人倫的。孔子以多藝聞於當世，其於音樂尤用力勤而趣味濃，如一在齊聞韶，三月不知肉味」，其沈酣之深如此。樂的言語是詩，故詩敎與樂敎相連。溫柔敦厚詩之體，也可以說是樂之體。興觀羣怨詩之用，也可以說是樂之用。儒家論敎育大半從禮樂入手，樂較禮尤爲基本。古書之言樂者，殆莫詳於周禮。漢人以周禮大宗伯之大司樂章，爲樂人之專書，世遂以之爲樂經。蓋古樂旣亡，周禮所述猶可推見其大槪。　　周禮有「建國必禁淫聲過聲凶聲慢聲」之語（卷六春官下），這句話也極有意義。吾國古人以爲聲普之道與政相通，移風易俗莫養於樂。一國的樂律，如果　於淫亂之音，或失去了哀樂之節，或者怠慢不恭，或音是一片亡國肅殺之昔，則其政治未有不受其影響。淫聲之移人由漸而深，始則蕩性情，繼則壞風俗，終至於一國之大經大法無不爲之動搖傾覆。純正的音樂在於發揚中和的德性，調節情欲，從容中道，並不主張禁止或摧殘，但亦勿使其趨於過繳。古人所謂興於詩，成於樂，其目的在陶養中庸的國民性，這原是很健全的思想。　　射與舞亦都與禮樂相聯緊。蓋樂之功用在於聲容並茂，有聲而無容不得謂之樂。周禮之樂舞以顏色和順身體修治者爲舞人，其所載古樂之目，上備先代，旁及邊裔，凡歷史上可以紀念的大事和人物，都已收羅在內。鏗鏘鼓舞，令人感動，故具有敎育上之價值。射是六藝之一，其目的亦在進德，非僅是一種技術。禮記射義云，「故射者進退周還必中禮，內志正，外體直，然後持弓矢審固，特弓失密固然後可以言中，此可以觀德行矣」。射爲古之大禮，孔子射於矍相之圃，觀者如堵牆。由此可見中國古代的人格敎育　體格極爲注重。　　儒家的根本觀念，賞在是正確健全，但何以會有人存政舉，人亡政息的現象，以致歷史上治日少而亂日多呢？據孫仲容先生的看法，以爲必須在力行方面加以補救。他在周禮政要序曾說，「漢儒不云乎，爲治不在多言，顧力行如何耳。誠更張今法，集吾羣力而行之不疑，則此四十篇者以致富强而有餘。其不能也，則雖人懷　賈之策，戶誦社馬之書，其於淪胥之痛，庸有敎於毫末乎」？仲容先生於是提出儒墨二學長短相補的見解，墨學的復興可以作爲儒學長短相補的見解，墨學的復興可以作爲儒學之新血輸。他以爲典莫備於周官，故作周禮正義行莫賢於墨翟，故又作墨子閒詁。他在墨子閒詁序中，稱墨子立身應世，具有本不。其用心篤厚，勇於實行。勞身苦志，以救世之敝。權略足以持危應變，而脫屣利祿，不以累其心·所學尤該綜道藝，洞究象數之微。（即今所謂科學），戰國時學者以孔墨並稱，墨學之昌幾埓洙泗。惜墨家之說往往趦於極端（非樂之論即其一例），以自苦爲極，不易得世人的同情，更難於踐行，這是秦漢以下二千年問墨學中絕的一大原因，仲容先生崛起淸季存亡絕續之交，主張援墨入儒，爲歷來儒者所不敢明言。他竭力提倡突不黔，席不煖的精神，且能躬行實踐，不徒托諸空言。從光緒二十年到★一于十年，他在溫處兩府屬銳意興學，新成立的學校有三百餘所之多，成績爲海內第一。後來浙江省敎育會公推先生爲會長，實爲浙人之光榮。仲容先生爲融合　墨的創見，以中和的德性爲根本，濟之以力行精神與科學方法，這種新學風果能深入於民問，深信對於當前建國大業，必將有重大的實獻。自由談談酒  陳詒先　　　三月六日自由談上迎之先生的一篇「紅毛燒與紹興黃」言：「陰雨無俚，聚三五舊游偏促小樓，微　盡歡，亦大佳事·惟酒價日昂，寒傖恐不能辦，不如且　他人諭酒文字·」余爲老　，又爲酒徒，讚此喉中作癢，茲將余平生所吃好酒略述之，聊以解　。　　民國三四年，余在上海譯畫時，朱古微　病山雪澄回居東有恒路，人稱爲虹口三老，陳散原居塘由路常同飲于非園。非國者，甘翰臣之花園，在舟由路，每日下午四五點鐘，我與我兄及散原先生虹口三老數人，常常不期而聚會于該園。主人藏有各種陳白蘭地威士忌，客人盡量而飲，並不　　，但不備菜，桌上除酒瓶酒杯外，陳頂好餅干一大盤，上等祁門紅茶一壺，吃茶飲酒，聽人之便。平生所吃洋酒，以此爲最，現在一瓶可吃威士忌，須數百萬元，更無如甘老之主人矣。　　民國九十間，余在北平教育部編審處，　酒友有　　生等數人，常約陳德　（梅蘭芳的老師）小吃于福與居春華樓，其時有一大宅門旗人袞落，出售其先人所藏黃酒一百餘罎，李柳溪探知之，全數包得，存于市城一酒店中，並不公開出賣，必須熟人酒友，始可以電話呌酒，每斤兩元，合之現價，的須六七十萬元。其酒已陳數十年，入口芳洌，過量而不醉，斟入杯中，琥珀色，有寶光，先有一股糟香撲鼻，飲畢，杯中留有薄薄一層若隊質，自杯口以至杯底皆然，其酒之濃厚可知·燙至微溫飲之，香氣尤盛。平生所飲黃酒，以此爲第一，名人錢新之，名律師汪子健，皆爲同飲此酒之人。　　民十四余辭去編審處事，回杭州，住在裏西湖自己莊子上。其時散源先生亦遷居旗下白傳路，一日同飲子新開酒店碧梧軒，其酒甚好，以後常常去吃，三月後，酒味漸差，半年後更差，蓋開張時有一批藏酒，漸漸以新酒滲對，故愈後愈不如前。同時朱曉嵐先生自滬遷居杭州，其城頭巷舊宅有藏酒四十餘　，係彼四十年前做蕭山縣時所自釀，余與余兄及散原先生汪頌年兄屢飲其家，酒極香醉，可以盡量。飯後回湖上，自淸波門坐瓜皮，（西湖小船名）出學士橋，掠白雲巷而西，明月在樹，淸風徐來，衣袖問所留酒香，時撲鼻觀，今日迴憶，恍同仙境。平生所飲黃酒，以此爲第二。其所以稱差於故都旗門之酒者，蓋其陳相同，而其質則異，朱酒是在蕭山所釀，故都之酒，則是山陰所釀。山陰有鑑湖，其水做酒最佳，同一鑑湖水，輕重厚薄之分，善飲酒者，入口略嚐，即能辦別何為　橋東酒，何爲橋西酒，其精細如此。兩洞回溯  半夢老人　　　　宜興善卷庚桑二洞，經儲簡翁一再修建，將沈埋地下的寶物，發掘出來，使我　得以窺見希奇古怪的形狀，可稱前無古人·現在時代，談到保存古璞，以爲天然之美，不宜損傷，然則玉之晶瑩，又何從發見耶？凡屬皮相盲從之論，大都去題萬里，不合現情。　　十餘年前，余一爲簡翁寫一聯，爲「鬼斧神工，天造地設；蜃樓海市，移步換形。」此十六字，批判洞中景物，恰恰相稱。未游兩洞者不能知之，即使游洞而如走馬看花者，也不能知之。關於此類景物，應具有出類拔萃的眼光，鎚幽　險的思想，藝術家美術家的頭腦，方可以闡發秘蘊，使得造化無所遁形。譬如海底珊瑚，經幾千禺年海水的衝激剝蝕，成爲意想不到的怪誕給構，我們雖竭力其索，窮研極究，也未能估計其萬　一，洞景之奇，大都如是。　　普通游洞的人，以爲善卷洞是一個三層樓，進洞便是中層，大會堂前，有小須彌山，獅王，象王，觀音海島等，獅王象王爲最奇。下層係水洞，上得小舟，回旋容與，由後洞而出，有水可航爲最奇。上層　霧洞，蒸霧滿塞，至冬尤甚，入者汗出如漿，往往畏霧不敢進而退，以霧多爲最奇。實則中層之奇，奇在表面，一　而盡；上層之奇，如萬古寒梅，玲瓏透澈，足够研究；下層之奇，通天石松，倒埀大佛手，尤爲峭倩，遠在西湖　　石乳洞之上。水洞之美，瓔珞倒埀，石花燦爛，一灣有一灣之勝，舟行須緩緩而過，方能洞見靡遺。另有其他一邱一壑，一石一物，皆須細細搜剔，塊偉始現。　　庚桑洞之美麗，幾於使人歎賞不盡，海王廳遍埀瓔珞，迤邐如錦幕綠鬚，余當以王開攝影店所攝之海王廳照片，例置觀之，竟使余舌橋不下，恐全世界無此豔麗鏡頭也！庚桑洞係以一一大洞內包無數小洞，而此無數小洞，又皆甚長，但小洞內殊少奇景。最初曾有仙人橋玉池雙柱等等，十年來不知變換何似。　　近年簡翁會爲經營洞外各地，開闢池沼，種植林木，建復寺院，仍以匪類橫行，使功敗埀成者，不知凡幾。又屢經有人借駐，林木被砍一空，石乳敲毀，視爲尋常，簡翁志不少衰，依然進行工作。「瑰琦光怪剔靡遺，粧點乾坤世豈知，誰識先生精氣滿，好拋心力雄奇。」回溯寇刧以前，不免為之概念　耳。蜜月旅行  契重　　　　旅行是一種樂事，結婚是一種甜蜜的生活；結婚而再出去旅行，這是再快樂不過的事了。　　在現在的時候，生活高漲，一個人要結婚已經不很容要結了婚而再出去旅行，這更是不容　的事，所以，一個人能够蜜月旅行，這眞是值得向人家　傲一下的。但是，蜜月旅行創始在什麼時候？因爲沒有文字的記載，所以無法知通。不過，據我的研究，這恐怕還是掠奪婚制遺留下來的一個殘痕吧。　　在過去掠奪婚制的時代，女人等於一種　貴的資產，一朝被人把女子掠奪了去，女方的親屬，認爲這是一種恥辱，以所必須興問罪之師，前去向男方爭鬥一下，設法把被掠的女子　了回來。在男方，爲了要避免這流血的爭鬥，所以掠奪到了女子，那男子就帶了女子遠出去躱避一下，待到過了一個相當的時期，使女方親族的情感緩和了，於是再帶了那掠奪到的女子回來。這出去躱避」下，後世就稱之爲」蜜月旅行」。所以，我認爲賓男旅行是掠奪婚制遺留下來的一個殘痕。　　我的猜想是這樣，不知社會學家以爲何如？哈與龍蝦  孚　　　　一位年輕的蛤小　，初次與龍蝦先生出游後，回到家中。　　他一往情深的嘆息着告訴她的姊妹們說：「他眞是可愛。起先他握住我的手，含情脈脈的看着我。接着他把他的手臂擱在我的肩膀上，於是——」這時，她模着她的頸項，高聲尖叫道：「天呀！我的珍珠呢？」散木謁宋六陵  散木　　　　亡國銅仙淚，雙垂南渡年，將軍空湼臂，宰相善和邊。不用厓山棄，先占王氣遷，居人定龍　，野服守桑田。　　亂石靑天裏，攢宮尚有邨，壤碑　蜨子，廢殿臥龍孫，不見樵蘇跡，惟餘烏雀喧，興亡一回首，惆悵欲無言！　　玉骨今何在？傷心石增空，兵戈餘想像，松檜尚蓯龍，鬼嘯三更月，龍呼九廟風，江潮疑待漏，夜夜向攢宮。郎才女貌  翼君　　　　男大須婚，女大當嫁，但是娶個甚麼樣的妻子，嫁個什麼樣的丈夫呢？這是大男大女們所須首先考慮到的。由國有句擇偶的格言：「郎才女貌」，這就是說，男子無才，便缺乏做丈夫的資格，女子貌醜，便不合做妻子的標準，只有所謂東都才子和南國佳人，才是一對理想的鴛鴦。　　這種注重郎才女貌的標準，已經是不盡妥善，但現在的情勢却更加糟透：男子以金多得妻，女子　色絕事夫。所以，多少在情塲逐鹿者，別的條件可以不談，男子只消有汽車·洋房·美鈔·金條，便可操勝利的左券，女子只消脂紅粉白，髪　肉裸，衣一九五二年式的新裝，作撒嬌撤痴之態，便可使鉅子闊老們拜倒在石榴袍下了。試問這種結合的基礎，夫婦關係跟一嫖客與妓女的關係有一什麼兩樣？　　我不反對郎之才，但反對在才之旁加一貝字，我不反對女之貌，但反對在貌之上加一怪字。（有貝之才不是不需要，但何需過多呢？）　　郎之才是需要的，需要什麼才呢？第一，他須能做家庭由的一良好分子，第二，他須是國家社會中的一良好公民，第三，他須永遠有一種職業，此外，他須具有生活上必需的有貝之才。女之貌也需要的，需要什麼貌呢？第一，和善之貌，第二，愉悅之貌，第三，熱情之貌，第四，整潔之貌，此外，尚須其有她丈夫眼目中的西施之美。　　同樣重要的是，男子於才能之外，尚須注重　表，女子於修飾之餘，也不可忽視才能。這就是說，我們不但要注重郎才女貌，而且要講求郎貌女才，男女雙方，都應該才貎並重才好。箴言  政槐　　將寬恕賜予你的仇敵，　　將容忍給你的反對者，　　將整個的心給你的朋友，　　慈愛獻給普天下的人類。天堂與蘇航  仲明　　小時候當　見人家說「上有天堂，下有蘇杭」這兩句話，心裏便很想有機會能到蘇杭二地去玩一次，看看這兩個和「天堂」相提並論的地方，究竟快樂和幸福到如何程度。　　這希望直到前五年才達到了一半，那是我在日寇的鐵蹄下第一次到蘇州去續，的一年。那時的蘇州，全在敵人的統制之下，敵人和奸徒在那裏胡作胡爲，人民在水深火熱中過着痛苦的生活，這初次和我見面的「人間天堂」，竟是一幅慘不忍睹的圖畫。　　勝利三年來的最近，才完成了我整個的理想。晚上十二點鐘，我和許多同學掮着行李走下了抗州的車站，我們在微弱的燈光下走向我們住宿的地方。當我首次踏上這又一個「人問天堂」的馬路上還沒有多久的時候，我的眼睛便接觸到馬路兩旁的牆邊正有一堆堆的東西滾在那裏，那破絮亂草裏面蜷伏着的不是人又是什麼呢？他們的臉仰着天便可不費力地瞧見月亮和星光，天上的風霜也可直接吹灑到他們的身上……這就是天堂嗎？　　但是這些都是事實，這正是人們所稱爲「天堂」的地方。　　當任何一方土地上還找得到啼飢號寒的窮人和逃亡者，當任何一方土地上還可以看到劍拔弩張的景象的時候，即使這塊土地上生長管美麗的花草，又豈能掩蔽得了地獄中苦難人們的歎息呢？語文舉訛  孑弦　　近世語文，頗多出自典籍，然紕認舛訛，不一而足，習用解久，不以爲怪。爰舉數例，以見一般：　　孤負　李凌答蘇武　「孤負凌心」·杜甫重送劉十弟判官詩「孤負滄　願，誰云晚見招」？韓愈感春詩：「孤負平生心」。「孤」與「負」義同。杜甫今夕行：「更長燭明不可孤」。「孤負」猶言背負，今多作「辜負」，「事」罪也，於義不通。辭海引李商隱爲有詩：「無端嫁得金龜壻，辜負香衾事早朝」。惟義山憶雪詩：「映書孤志業」，「辜負香衾」之「辜」字，或後世刻木有誤耳。　　得手應心　莊子天道篇：「輸扁對齊桓公曰：　輸徐則甘而不固，疾則苦而不入；，不徐不疾，得之於手，而應終心。」今人每謂心手相習於不覺，多作「得心應手」，似有未合。按蘇軾贈南屏謙師詩序：「南屏謙師妙於茶事，自云得之於心，應之於手，非可言傳學至者。」「得心應手」之訛，或始於此。　　飛黃騰踏　飛黃，馬名。韓愈符讚書城南詩：「飛黃騰踏去，不能顧蟾蜍。」俗以「騰踏」誤作「騰達，」且以「飛黃騰達」喻人之發跡，與原義相去殊遠。　　每下愈况莊子知北遊：「正獲之問於監市腹豨也，每下愈況，」意謂每於至下之處，愈可比況他物」。今俗常作「每况愈下，」意亦不同，可謂數典而忘祖。逍遙花  陳慎言　　第十四章　逍遙海上　（一一四）　　　　　渚　又想，鳳笙只是不時髦而已，確是一個柴米汕鹽克勤克儉的賢妻，並且存心忠厚，自和她結婚後，就未會給她一點安慰，反而給她許多刺激，若換個別人，一定要借此題目，興風作浪，大加非難，她却自覓職業，自食其力，受我如此作踐，她却聲言決不改嫁，像這樣有婦德的女人，在現代社會義，是少有的。雲卿常說她好，我不相信，現在同想起來，實在對不住她。至　　彼此青梅竹馬之交，相　已經二十歲年，她是一往情深，娶鳳笙給她一個刺激，這次絲愛　　，又給她一大刺激，他雖然滿心憤怒，總是容忍不吐，那天晚上，再三要求她，她　說不忍言，由這一點看起來，我利用她　說鳳　離婚，她一定心裏很明白的，只是不肯說出來，叫我難堪。這一次她突然到天津去，當然是怕我再去糾纏她，她臨行把玻璃板下我的照片帶去，可見她對我，至今還不忘情的檢討自己數月來的行動，實在對不起她。鳳笙和雲卿，都是眞心愛我的，爲了綺紈一人，都把他們的情意辜負了。但是綺紈對我更是一片熱情，苦心愛護我，自己却受了許多委曲，到現在還有許多人，議諭她不對，說起來，在這三人中，她的用心最苦，處境最難，她現在上海重上舞台，總算重入光明之路，我應該寫封信安慰她。渚齋想到這裏，躺在床上，再也睡不着，情不自禁，披衣起來，在床前一張小桌上，拿起筆，把　紈離開北平到現在，本人的近狀，和所受感觸刺激，詳詳細細寫了一封長信，足有兩個鐘頭，才把這封信寫完，心裏所有的煩悶苦惱，似都由筆尖下寄託在這一封信上。薩公翰墨  清雷學園　　　　見到薩老英雄自己寫的詩，〔本報三十日第五版）更是意外之奇．以武人而寫作俱佳，勝過老名士！以九十高齡，而精神飽滿，筆筆軒昂，壓倒一切。詩意充分表現愛國忠貞大節，不但「人瑞」，而且「國瑞」。在同版的另欄，並見潘公（本報社長）游西湖題畫一首，亦是七言，信手拈來，有自然之意致，不及薩老英雄之蒼堅，固是年齡氣格關係，亦即景寫意之作，與鄭重紀念之工筆作風，根本不同也。却引起老霄研詩之興，就此談談說說。　　先說老英雄之書法「銀鈎鐵畫」，一氣貫注，是眞歐體正宗（中惟「仁壽」「名」「身」四字略參魯公筆致）。末句倚闌七字勁氣內歛，結搆精嚴，統然「化度」帖　，脾睨陳弢菴，上接翁覃溪，出於武人老人之手，可稱臨池家之奇蹟。（半夢題翁學士緣研拓片云：「覃溪老人歐體書，方圓峭勁占璠璵」。覃溪自題所藏拓化度寺帖云：「醴泉暢朗眞皮相，化度淳微實嗣音」。歐帖有醴泉銘，有化度寺。覃溪專終化度，近人陳寶琛字弢菴，即　遜帝溥儀之師傳，服膺覃溪，勤習化度，淸同治七年翰林，民國廿四年去世，壽八十有八，亦是福建，薩老的同鄉。）　　再說老英雄的詩。前一段小序（亦即長題）六十餘字，叙事賅括，筆致雅凈，氣度從容，其徵學養深純。詩是七絕體，字字熨貼，句句安詳。結句尤有寄托，精神一振。「倚蘭及見國威揚」是表明如此高年，還能親覩民族勝利。此即陸放翁「但悲不見九州同」之意而反用之，略無痕迹。中國之海軍及船政創辦於閩，侯官沈文肅（葆楨）致力尤勤。甲午一戰，敗於日本，二十餘年經營之艦隊全然摧毀。薩老自幼出身於此，至此暮年頤壽，及見倭寇投降，胸中之積憤一消，其感慨欣幸，自然眾不同。</p>

<h3>The Sixth Session of the National Assembly: Minister Bai Delivers Military Report; Acknowledges the Increased Strength of the Communist Bandits, Which Should Not Be Underestimated</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 12th] The National Assembly held its sixth session on the morning of the 12th. Due to a majority of representatives attending the central memorial week at the Ministry of National Defense, the meeting was delayed until 10:05 AM. 1,574 representatives were present, and the ninth presidium group presided on rotation, chaired by Wang Yunwu. After the secretariat read the minutes of the fifth meeting, Wang reported on two decisions made by the presidium at its evening meeting on the 11th: (1) The list of presidential candidates will be announced on the 16th, and the list of vice-presidential candidates will be announced on the 20th. The announcement will be made through publication in the National Government Gazette, notification to each representative, and posting near the entrance of the assembly hall. There was no objection from the entire assembly. The agenda for this morning was a military report and review, delivered by Minister of National Defense Bai Chongxi. It lasted for an hour, and due to time constraints, the review could not be conducted. The meeting adjourned at 11:53 AM. During Minister Bai's report, senior generals from the Ministry of National Defense were present in the government officials' seats as observers.</p>
<p>Minister Bai's military report was divided into three points: (1) The organization of the Ministry of National Defense and its responsibilities; (2) The trends in national defense construction over the past two years; (3) The course and development of the communist bandits' conspiracy to harm the nation. In addition, detailed reports were given on the implementation of total war in Central China and the meager treatment of military personnel, which garnered several rounds of applause.</p>
<p>Bai first stated: Chairman Chiang has already given detailed reports on the situations in the Northeast, North China, Northwest, and Central China battlefields. The organization of the Ministry of National Defense is based on the systems of the United States, Britain, and France, as well as the national conditions of our country. The Ministry of National Defense is under the Executive Yuan and serves as a decision-making body. Its implementation is the responsibility of the Chief of General Staff and the commanders-in-chief of the Army, Navy, Air Force, and Combined Logistics. Over the past two years, national defense has been established under the principles of safeguarding the integrity of national territory and sovereignty and preventing foreign aggression, while also adapting to the current need to suppress bandits and the needs of future wars. The progress of weaponry is closely related to scientific progress, and the Ministry of National Defense is currently assisting the National Defense Science Committee in its research. In terms of personnel, a conscription system and intensive training for high school graduates are being implemented as sources of soldiers and officers.</p>
<p>Regarding the communist bandits' harm to the nation, Bai pointed out the communist bandits' use of the War of Resistance against Japan as a pretext to attack friendly forces and expand their strength. In the 26th year of the Republic (1937), the communist bandits' troops numbered only 30,000, but by the time of victory, they had grown tenfold to 310,000. After the victory, political negotiations allowed the communist bandits to grow stronger. They now have over 1.3 million field army soldiers, not including military region troops and militia. The communist bandits now have an evil history of many years, hundreds of thousands of armed personnel, international backing, and combat experience. We should not underestimate them. On July 1st of last year, the government issued an order for mobilization to suppress the rebellion, determined to resolve the communist bandits militarily. The communist bandits' propaganda that they crossed the Yellow River last year and will cross the Yangtze River this year is not empty talk. The communist bandits' crossing of the Yellow River has already been realized. Whether they will cross the Yangtze River this year will depend on our strength.</p>
<h3>Mobilize the Power of Total War; Suppressing the Rebellion Cannot Rely Solely on the National Army; It Is Necessary to Organize the People to Prevent Problems Before They Arise</h3>
<p>Regarding how to mobilize to complete the suppression of the rebellion, Minister Bai repeatedly and solemnly pointed out that it cannot rely solely on the National Army; it is necessary to mobilize the power of the people. We cannot sit and wait for the bandits to come; we must prevent problems before they arise. He especially hoped that the representatives present would return to their hometowns and engage in leadership work, believing that with the power of the entire nation, the communist bandits could be eliminated. Bai pointed out that the communist bandits implemented a "hollowed-out defense" preparation last year, as well as the "three requests" policy of seeking soldiers, seeking food, and seeking battle. We, on the other hand, are countering with total war. Bai used his experience of being ordered to take charge of the suppression in the Dabie Mountains area since November 7th of last year as an example, saying: Liu Bocheng's bandit troops, numbering about 120,000, fled to the Dabie Mountains, attempting to build a base area. We implemented total war, first using military force to defeat the main force of the bandits, then using military force to cover political planning, consolidate the political center, organize and equip civilian forces, and then use politics to coordinate with military affairs, implementing suppression, controlling the area, and breaking the bandits' "three requests" policy. This method has gradually become effective. Most of Liu Bocheng's bandit troops have fled north, and only three regiments of remnant bandits remain in the Dabie Mountains area, which are currently being suppressed. Bai said: The total war in the Dabie Mountains is a test. In the past, local leaders had too little authority, which prevented them from exerting their power. Now, pacification zones are being demarcated in various places, and personnel, finance, and other powers are concentrated in the hands of the pacification zone commander. In the future, the power of total war can be brought into play. After Bai highly praised the people's defense forces in western Henan, saying that the people's defense forces in western Henan had made great contributions in the War of Resistance and the suppression of bandits, he said that what can be done in western Henan can also be done in other provinces. Bai especially introduced their slogan: "Risk your life to protect your life, bankrupt yourself to protect your property." This can be implemented everywhere. Local self-defense forces are funded by the central government, and demobilized soldiers are employed as officers. Armories are also established in various places to replenish weapons and ammunition. Bai also revealed that a fairly large armory has been established in western Henan, which will be able to produce finished products in about four months.</p>
<p>For the sake of preparedness, Bai advocated that the provinces south of the Yangtze River should also expand the authority of local leaders, organize popular forces, and eliminate the hidden forces of the communist bandits, so that they cannot be internal collaborators for crossing the river. Do not wait until after the communist bandits have crossed the river to take action, or it will be too late to regret.</p>
<p>When Bai described the issue of military discipline, he analyzed that the actual salary received by soldiers and officers was less than a quarter of what it was before the war. The poor food of the soldiers affects their health and combat effectiveness, and taking from the local people increases their burden. To implement total war, soldiers must be fed and horses must be fattened so that the officers and soldiers can exert their best efforts.</p>
<p>Bai concluded: We do not need to be pessimistic about suppressing and reducing the communist bandits; we must have confidence. If the people in every locality can organize, risk their lives to protect their lives, bankrupt themselves to protect their property, and coordinate with military suppression, the work of suppressing the rebellion can be completed smoothly. Bai also said: When the representatives review military affairs, he hopes that they will not hesitate to give their advice.</p>
<p>After Bai's report, Zhang Tifang, a representative from Chahar, and Zhao Yongfu, a representative from Shandong, spoke on the military situation in the Northeast and Shandong. As the legally stipulated adjournment time had arrived, the meeting was adjourned.</p>
<h3>The Chairman Sends Chen Lifu and Others to Console Hunger-Striking Representatives</h3>
<p>Persuasion to Resume Eating Still Yields No Results</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 12th] The National Assembly representatives who signed in and were elected have been on a hunger strike for over two weeks. Chairman Chiang is very concerned about their health and specially sent Chen Lifu, Gu Zhenggang, He Zhonghan, and Zheng Yanfen on the afternoon of the 12th as representatives to the Fifth Reception Center to express condolences and persuade them to resume eating. Chen and the others arrived at the Fifth Reception Center at 2:00 PM and advised the eight representatives that they should prioritize their health and resume eating first; as for the issue of attending the assembly, a solution could be found. After persuading them until 4:00 PM, the hunger-striking representatives stated that they were still unwilling to resume eating unconditionally without a concrete and definite guarantee, but they all expressed their great gratitude for Chairman Chiang's kindness.</p>
<h3>National Assembly Representatives Review Military Affairs; Enthusiastically Express Frank Opinions; Demand Investigation of Negligent Generals</h3>
<p>The National Assembly continued its session at 12:30 PM, presided over by the tenth presidium group, chaired by Huang Jilu. After Yu Bin reported on the presidium's handling of the motion proposed by Wang Yunming and 1,321 others regarding the issue of signed representatives, the review of military affairs began. The total number of representatives requesting to speak reached over 230, but each speaker was often unable to limit themselves to within five minutes, so by the time the meeting adjourned at 6:20 PM, less than 30 people had spoken. Some representatives submitted their written opinions to the secretariat to be read out. Summarizing the opinions of the representatives, they generally focused on the following points: (1) The treatment of military personnel is too low, and soldiers are not eating enough, which affects their combat effectiveness; (2) There are too many abuses in conscription; (3) The discipline of some units is too poor; (4) The command methods of the General Headquarters should be improved, so that local commanders have the power to make expedient commands; (5) After the victory, the guerrilla units in the Northeast and North China were reorganized one by one, forcing them into rebellion, which was tantamount to providing resources to the communists; (6) High-ranking military officers are corrupt and engage in illegal activities, and the personnel who took over only cared about materials, resulting in the loss of popular support; (7) The compensation for the families of soldiers who died in the suppression of the rebellion is inadequate, and the procedures are too cumbersome; (8) The central government should replenish the local armed forces with weapons and ammunition; (9) Rewards and punishments are unclear, right and wrong are not distinguished, and why are the responsible authorities not punished? Several representatives expressed strong dissatisfaction that Minister Bai's report did not cover North China and the Northeast. The representatives from the Northeast and Shandong were especially critical of Chief of General Staff Chen Cheng. Yin Bingyan from Andong advocated "borrowing heads" to boost morale. Zhang Zhenlu from Liaobei requested that Chairman Chiang emulate Zhuge Liang in "executing Ma Su with tears." Zhang Luxian from Shandong made an urgent motion requesting the detention of Chen Cheng. Cui Tianyi from Jilin requested that Liang Huasheng be dismissed and severely punished. Wu Shuban from Liaoning said: All generals who have harmed the country should be investigated. In addition, those with urgent war situations in various places requested that troops be sent immediately to reinforce them. Zhang Zhenlu requested that Liaopan be secured and the Shenjin line be opened. Wen Guangyi from Anhui shouted that the crisis in Central China was no less than that in the Northeast and North China. Wang Lunqing from Henan requested that the National Assembly send a telegram to the Ministry of National Defense requesting reinforcements for Zhengzhou and Kaifeng. Li Peiguo from Rehe said: Chengde is surrounded on all sides, and he hopes that the assembly will decide to send troops to aid Rehe. Hu Zhongwu from Anhui pointed out that the hidden bandits in southern Anhui should be suppressed. The Shandong representatives also requested that a large army be sent as soon as possible to relieve the crisis in Changle and Weixian. Huo Tianyi from Jilin appealed to the government to deal with the communist bandits in the Northeast and North China with all its strength. The meeting continued until 6:00 PM, and the chairman announced an extension of 20 minutes. There were still many speakers, and it was finally decided to hand over the opinions of the representatives to the secretariat for collation and submission to the Ministry of National Defense for a response.</p>
<h3>The National Army in Western Liaoning is Getting Stronger; Traffic Between Shenyang and Jinzhou Can Be Opened Soon; Bandits on the North Bank of the Liao River Have Been Repelled</h3>
<p>[Our Jinzhou Dispatch, 12th] The strength of the National Army in the western Liaoning corridor, centered on Jinzhou, is expanding and increasing daily. These new forces are mostly veteran soldiers who have re-enlisted. Once they are equipped, they can fight. Moreover, Li Mi's troops, who have been landing at Huludao for several days, have mostly arrived at their designated areas. This is news that Jinzhou and Shenyang are paying attention to and are happy to hear. Shenyang is eagerly awaiting the National Army to open up traffic between Jinzhou and Shenyang, which may not be far off. The local military authorities are currently making an action plan and deployment. Fan Hanjie and Sun Du are traveling between Shenyang and Jinzhou and to Huludao to see the landing troops and other work, all of which shows that traffic between Jinzhou and Shenyang is bound to be opened.</p>
<p>[Our Shenyang Dispatch, 12th] Around Jiumen, Sanmianchuan on the north bank of the Liao River, about 5,000 invading bandits were repelled. This was a battle for food and not yet the prelude to the spring offensive. The bandits wandering near Shahe are still observing the situation. There is no fighting south of Shenyang, and Benxi is quiet.</p>
<p>[Another Dispatch] The communist bandits in the Northeast are actively building railways to facilitate supplies. The two lines from Harbin to Yongji and from Yongji to Yanji have been repaired. Traffic has also opened between Tongliao and Zhangwu.</p>
<h3>The Battle Situation in Central Henan is Calm Before the Storm; The Two Communist Bandit Commanders Chen Yi and Chen Geng Plan to Attack Zhengzhou with 70,000 Troops; Bandits Fleeing East from Xingyang Are Met with a Head-On Blow</h3>
<p>[Our Hankou Dispatch, 12th] After the National Army recovered Queshan and Zhumadian, the war in southern Henan has become quiet. It is reported that Chen Yi's 3rd and 8th Columns and Chen Geng's 4th and 9th Columns, totaling about 70,000 men, are encircling Zhengzhou.</p>

Air Force planes flew to the area south of Wuyang and west of Suiping on the morning of the 12th to search for and bomb the bandits, causing heavy casualties.</p>
<p>[Our Xinyang Dispatch, 12th] Dong Shaoming, the director of the "Central China Military Region Prisoner Management Office," a confidant of Liu Bocheng, was captured after the National Army captured Zhumadian. The fact that the manager of prisoners was captured is a laughable matter.</p>

<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 12th] With the situation in Zhengzhou and Kaifeng tense, dozens of Henan National Assembly representatives, including Zhang Fang, Chen Panling, and Yan Huatang, are actively seeking assistance, requesting that the central government urgently dispatch a large army to rescue them. In view of the seriousness of the current situation, Zhang and others have decided to convene an emergency meeting of all Henan National Assembly representatives on the morning of the 13th to discuss strategies to rescue Zhengzhou and Kaifeng. Zhang originally intended to meet with Chairman Chiang again on the evening of the 12th, but temporarily abandoned the plan and will wait until after the Henan National Assembly meeting on the 12th to decide.</p>
<h3>Wang Yaowu Flies to Inspect Changle and Weixian; Communicates with the Defending Generals in the Air and Drops a Handwritten Letter; The Bandits Fiercely Attacking Weixian Are Repeatedly Repelled</h3>
<p>[Our Jinan Dispatch, 12th] Amidst the fierce fighting in Changle and Weixian, Wang Yaowu flew over Changle and Weixian for inspection at 1:15 PM on the 12th. The special plane arrived over Changle City at 2:00 PM. The soldiers and civilians in the city waved their hands to indicate when the plane arrived, appearing extremely excited. The bandit trenches and bunkers surrounding the city were densely packed. Wang communicated with the defending general Zhang Jingyue, expressing his great encouragement, and dropped a handwritten letter and a pennant with the handwritten inscription "Bulwark of Central Shandong." After flying around the city for a week, he inspected the area above Tianma. When he arrived over Weixian at 2:15 PM, the fighting at the northwest pass was fierce. There were large fires everywhere outside the north gate and on the northeast and northwest sides of the city. The area outside the north gate had become a sea of fire, and white smoke was rising to over 1,000 meters. Wang communicated with the defending general Chen Jincheng, encouraging him with the words "Everything has a solution," "Certain victory," and "Certain success." After inspecting the area above Weixian for three weeks, he inspected Fangzi and Hanting and other places before returning to Jinan at 3:40 PM.</p>
<p>[Our Qingdao Dispatch, 12th] The National Army is still firmly defending Weixian, Hanting, Changle, and Tianma, and the fighting has reached a fever pitch. On the evening of the 11th, the bandits launched another fierce attack on Weicheng. The fighting at Nanguan Leixiaoshan and Nandaying was especially fierce. The bandits broke through the city pass positions several times but were eventually repelled. All four passes are currently standing firm. The bandit army is using heavy artillery to bombard the city, causing casualties among the residents. Although the situation at the airport, Ershilipu, and Fangzi is unclear, Fangzi may still be under the control of the National Army. The troops of Zhang Jingyue, the defending general of Changle, launched an attack in three directions on the morning of the 11th, completely defeating two battalions of the bandit Bohai 14th and 15th Regiments and destroying the bandit blockhouses. The positions at Changle and Tianma are extremely solid.</p>
<h3>Representatives from Changle and Weixian Arrive in Nanjing to Request Reinforcements</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 12th] Li Yuting, a representative from the Changle and Weixian areas of central Shandong, has come to Nanjing specifically to request troops. According to him: The Changle and Weixian areas are strategically important and are the spiritual bulwarks of the people of Shandong. The defenders of Changle and Weixian are a brigade of the National Army and ten regiments of local troops. The communist bandits have been launching a full-scale attack since the 10th, and the defending troops are fighting fiercely. There are a total of 35,000 students in Weixian City, and there are also many righteous people. If they are unfortunately lost, the loss of personnel will be irreplaceable. We originally planned to ask the central government to airlift troops to aid us, but now that Fangzi Airport has been lost, we only hope that large armies will be dispatched from Qingdao and Jinan to relieve the siege, or at least the air force should assist the troops in covering the evacuation of the students and people. We must not sit idly by and fail to rescue them.</p>
<h3>The National Army in Dongguan, Linfen, Automatically Withdraws Westward</h3>
<p>[Our Taiyuan Dispatch, 12th] There was a bloody battle in Dongguan, Linfen on the 11th. Bandit corpses were scattered everywhere, but due to the disparity in numbers, the National Army automatically withdrew westward. The fierce fighting shifted to the outer edge of the moat outside the east gate. After Dongguan fell to the bandits, the battle situation was quieter on the 12th. Nearly 1,000 cadres and students have joined the army.</p>
<h3>A Chronicle of the National Assembly: A Verbal Battle on Military Affairs</h3>
<p>[Our Special Report] In the National Assembly Hall, filled with an atmosphere of peace, the intense smell of gunpowder was also detected today: verbal swords and oral spears, reviewing the responsibility for lost territories and harm to the country on the one hand, and trying to turn the tide on the other, wanting to borrow troops. This military review, though unable to summon wind and rain, is better than mere armchair theorizing.</p>
<p>The long report by Minister Bai of the Ministry of National Defense today gave people the impression that it lacked the changes in the war situation and strategy that everyone valued, and the authorities' preparations for the current key situation and tactics. However, the coordination of military, political, and economic affairs in the overall war and the organization of local armed forces were quite satisfactory. However, as his report was nearing its conclusion, a burst of cannon fire came from a corner upstairs, descending from the sky. Some people called for the seriousness of the current situation in the Northeast, and the Shandong representatives downstairs also demanded the punishment of those responsible. However, due to time constraints, there was no time to hear a reply, and the morning session ended.</p>
<p>The afternoon session was supposed to be a review of the military report. Chairman Huang Jilu was presiding over the proceedings on the stage, and requests to speak were flying up like snowflakes. Regarding the review of the situation in the Northeast, the representatives demanded that Xiong Shihui and Chen Cheng attend the meeting to report, as they wanted to investigate the responsibility for turning the Northeast into a state where almost no county town was intact. One Northeast representative after another spoke, and every word earned a thunderous round of applause.</p>
<p>To Boost Morale, Advocate for "Borrowing Heads"</p>
<p>The Andong representative Yin Bingyan said on the speaker's platform: "My method is the simplest. To boost morale, we only need to borrow a few heads to use." The representatives shouted in agreement. When Yin spoke passionately, he repeatedly pounded the table with his fist, and the audience responded with applause and cheers. Yin Bingyan's concluding remark was: "Please ask the authorities, were they right or wrong in what they did in the Northeast? If they were right, they should be awarded the Order of Blue Sky and White Sun, but if they were wrong, they should be killed!" Zhang Zhenlu from Liaobei said: "There are 600,000 to 700,000 troops eating food in the Northeast, but only 300,000 are actually fighting. The Ministry of National Defense should investigate!" Yang Zhiping from Liaobei said: "The battle situation in the Northeast is a dead game. The officers who go to the Northeast only know how to want houses, want cars, marry wives, and deduct military pay. The officers are getting rich, and the soldiers are not eating enough. How do you expect them to fight?" Li Xiangtai said: "At the time of victory, there were 150,000 soldiers of the puppet Manchurian army and 300,000 police in the Northeast, all of whom were driven to the communist party. High-ranking government officials were secretly helping the communist party. Shouldn't the government punish them?" A female representative from the Northeast advocated taking Tianjin and Beiping as the base for suppressing the bandits, with Chuan Zuoyi unifying the political, military, and economic affairs. She said: "Chuan Zuoyi is the only hope for the people of the North!" Then the Henan representatives shouted that Zhengzhou and Kaifeng were like cities in danger. The Shaanxi representatives emphasized that the situation in the Northwest was no less serious than that in the Northeast and North China. The representatives from Jiangsu, Anhui, and Hubei said that the traces of the bandits north and south of the Yangtze River were threatening the capital. In the end, every speaker proposed an "urgent motion" to call for action, emphasizing its importance. They wanted the central government to send a large army to rescue them to address the symptoms, and to organize local self-defense forces to address the root cause. They were representing the voices of millions of people in the Northeast, North China, Northwest, and Central China, and they wanted to take this opportunity to express their grievances of the past two years to the central government and make specific demands.</p>
<p>Passionate and Enthusiastic, Cries Accompanied by Applause</p>
<p>Every word was truthful, and every event was heartbreaking. The atmosphere in the hall was very different from the past. In the past, it was fatigue bombing plus chaos and noise. Today, there were passionate and just cries and applause. Therefore, the meeting time was extended by 20 minutes unexpectedly, and it still felt extremely short. Finally, the chairman proposed that all the opinions of the representatives, whether oral or written, be handed over to the secretariat for collation and organization, which was agreed to by most people. Thus, this military review with the scent of gunpowder came to an end. (April 12th in Nanjing)</p>

<h3>Special Article: On the So-Called "Crisis of Education"</h3>
<p>— Mao Zishui</p>
<p>What is the crisis of education? It seems everyone can answer this question, but the answers will likely differ. The most common answer seems to be: "The poor economic situation of the country leaves teachers and students struggling to feed themselves, so how can we talk about education!" However, I believe that while the economic relationship is a major reason hindering educational progress, it is not the only reason, and not the biggest reason. As a matter of fact, more than seven out of ten students in national universities are on public scholarships. These scholarship students only bear the costs of clothing and books. To receive a university education, one should at least be able to raise this amount. The remaining three out of ten students either have better family circumstances or receive other scholarships, so the truly impoverished are few in number. As for teachers, those with large families are of course in great difficulty; those with smaller families, if their salaries can be adjusted appropriately, can barely manage to maintain basic food and clothing. When the country reaches this point, we should comfort ourselves internally with "A gentleman is steadfast in poverty," and externally we should take good citizens in the world who are suffering—such as the British—as examples. If we only want to admire the lives of corrupt officials or wealthy merchants, then that is just "asking for trouble."</p>
<p>Of course, I am not saying that there are no problems with our country's education funding now. Education requires equipment. The expenses required for higher education equipment are especially enormous. Because it not only requires books, but also instruments, chemicals, and so on. And most of these things can only be obtained with foreign exchange. Given our country's financial situation, we really cannot have such abundant foreign exchange to equip all national universities with modern equipment.</p>
<p>But in addition to the funding problem, there is an even greater crisis in education in China now. This greater crisis lies in the teachers and students themselves. The person writing this article is a teacher, so let me start with the teachers.</p>
<p>Many teachers are highly knowledgeable and virtuous, and many excel in one aspect. The former are of course both "teachers of knowledge and teachers of people," and the latter are also worthy of being role models for the younger generation. However, I believe that teachers should also bear the responsibility of guidance in students' lives in addition to imparting knowledge, and teachers should treat students as their own children. Good behavior of students should of course be encouraged and supported; inappropriate behavior of students should also be warned against and dissuaded from. One of the biggest crises in education in China now is that teachers are too indifferent to the behavior of students.</p>
<p>In addition, there is an even worse phenomenon: some teachers, in order to "win the crowd," try their best to cater to the psychology of students, and praise students' behavior without regard to right or wrong. The harm of such people is actually greater than those who only know how to suppress students. Because the latter may still have the good of the students at heart, while those who cater to the psychology of students are all "only concerned with their own success, regardless of the life or death of others." Although there are not many such people, they can be said to be the dregs of the education community!</p>
<p>As for the students, the situation is similar to that of the teachers. Among the students, there are those who are exceptionally gifted, understanding ten things from hearing one; such students make people feel refreshed. Among the students, there are those who study diligently, ask questions eagerly, and follow the rules; such students make people feel happy. Among the students, there are those who readily accept good advice and bravely pursue justice; such students inspire ambition. But these types of students, when added up, I am afraid only account for half of all students. As for the other half, most of them are mediocre. In fact, the function of education is most evident in the "average person." Unfortunately, the atmosphere in schools now is too bad, so that the average person does not get the benefit of "hemp growing among weeds, standing upright without being propped up," but only gets the detriment of "white sand in the mud, becoming black along with it." This is really the greatest crisis of education.</p>
<p>This bad school atmosphere is due to the nature of the students, but most of it is due to society and the school authorities. Let me give an example of something that is most easily seen and generally considered unimportant. Now, there are bulletin boards on the walls of universities, and slogans are almost always seen on the pillars. As soon as you enter the school gate, you are greeted with a dazzling array. Decorating a "university" to be more "beautiful" than an old-fashioned theater is really enough to make people "laugh and cry." Over time, people get used to it. The school authorities turn a blind eye, and the students improve their skills day by day, innovating new patterns. From this small thing, one can also see the "culture" of a nation! If the school had advised the students on this kind of behavior from the beginning, so that there would be a certain limit, it would not have come to the current situation. Of course, if every student took learning as their primary task, and everyone knew how to love themselves and cherished the school, then this kind of behavior would not have occurred. Bulletin boards and slogans are really unimportant, but the atmosphere of the school is important!</p>
<p>Someone asked: "Bulletin boards and slogans are tools for students to express opinions or promote ideologies. If you don't approve of students making bulletin boards and posting slogans, aren't you reactionary?" On this, I have to defend myself. Students, for the sake of self-expression, can of course publish articles. But there are many ways to publish, and it is not necessary to use colored paper pasted on the wall. If it is necessary to use the form of a bulletin board, it should also be done through a proper method planned by all the students, so that it is not pasted everywhere, without order. The most important thing is that the person who makes the bulletin board must be responsible for every word and sentence they write. Whether it is about a private person or the government, do not scold indiscriminately, be based on facts, discuss the matter on its own merits, and do not say empty words: this is the attitude that a person who writes a bulletin board should have. If, because it is a bulletin board, they recklessly use the tricks of a village woman scolding in the street, then they are accustomed to vulgarity! This is what our soulful students should constantly reflect on. Otherwise, I really don't know where the current school atmosphere will lead the youth of China, and where it will lead "China."</p>
<p>As for slogans of an advertising nature, they do not seem appropriate in universities. Anything of an advertising nature has a bit of deception in it, and would our pure-hearted students be willing to commit the crime of deceiving their classmates? Even using slogans to promote ideologies is inappropriate. Students are in the highest institutions of learning. They have the books of ancient and modern sages to learn from, and they have teachers at the school to consult. They should also have a considerable ability to judge what is good and what is evil, and what is right and what is wrong. Using slogans to promote any ideology to classmates is a manifestation of the mentality of "thinking too highly of oneself and looking down on others." A person who has this mentality towards classmates is either arrogant or foolish.</p>
<p>In short, the poor discipline in schools is indeed the biggest crisis in education in China today. Bulletin boards and slogans are just one example. If we do not keep the destiny of our country and the culture of all mankind in mind, then there is naturally no so-called crisis of education. "Only by overcoming thoughts can one become a sage; only by not thinking of holiness can one act as a bandit." The greatest force in solving the crisis in China is not in the government, but in teachers and young students.</p>

<h3>Special Envoy Soong Tzu-wen Arrives in Hainan. Mr. Soong Discusses Four Missions of This Trip with Reporters: Suppressing Bandits to Save Hainan and Developing Hainan to Build Hainan.</h3>
<p>[Report from Haikou by this newspaper, 12th] Soong Tzu-wen, John Leighton Stuart, and B.H. Badger, accompanied by Huang Chen-chiu, Hsu Ching-tang, Hsieh Wen-lung, and Henry, the head of the US industrial advisory group, and more than 20 others, took off from Guangzhou on two special planes in the morning of the 12th, and arrived at the airport in the suburbs of the city at 11:20 a.m. The number of people from all walks of life who went to welcome them reached more than 4,000, unprecedentedly enthusiastic. After Mr. Soong and Stuart disembarked, they accepted flowers from the Girl Scouts of Chungcheng Elementary School respectively. Amidst the loud music of the orchestra, after reviewing the guard of honor, they were accompanied by Han Hanying, the commander of the bandit suppression, to drive to the Army Reception Center to rest. Mr. Soong and others stayed there. Mr. Soong then met with reporters to talk about the mission of this trip: (1) to inspect the actual situation of bandit suppression, (2) to find ways to develop Hainan Island's fishing, salt, and mines, (3) to find ways to encourage overseas Chinese to return to Hainan to invest, and (4) to plan to establish a Hainan Industrial Company, first state-owned and then private, and to help increase the white paper quota for various newspapers. He then visited the ambassador, who said that he was very happy to come to Hainan Island for this trip, and hoped that China and the United States could cooperate closely. In the evening, he attended a banquet hosted by Commander Han, and it was decided that he would fly to Yulin on the 13th.</p>
<p>[Further report] Chu Tzu-wen and others came to Hainan this time, focusing on development and bandit suppression. The headquarters of the bandit suppression command has collected data on various major issues and presented them to Mr. Soong for review. According to relevant parties, Mr. Soong believes that Hainan Island suffers from serious banditry, lack of water conservancy, obstructed transportation, undeveloped agriculture and forestry, stagnant factories, and people living in poverty, and said that there is no way to save Hainan without bandit suppression, and no way to build Hainan without development. The factories left by the enemy and puppets will be quickly restored to production in the form of joint public-private operation.</p>
<h3>Feng Weijun, Commander of the Hainan Island Fortress, Arrives in Haikou</h3>
<p>[Report from Haikou by the Central News Agency, 12th] The newly appointed Hainan Island Fortress Commander Feng Weijun arrived here today and will transfer to Yulin Port to take office.</p>
<h3>Guangdong Marine Fishing Base Selected as Yulin Port on Hainan Island</h3>
<p>New fishing boats arrive one after another to fish</p>
<p>[Report from Guangzhou by this newspaper, 12th] Zhao Junmai, Director of the National Fisheries Administration, came to inspect the south last month and selected Yulin Port on Hainan Island as the Guangdong marine fishing base. The Guangdong Fisheries Branch has been established. The branch already has many new fishing boats that have arrived in Yulin to fish. Recently, fisheries expert Cheng Yiyue was hired as the deputy director and chief captain. Mr. Cheng led technical personnel from Guangzhou to Yulin on the 12th.</p>
<h3>Bai Chongxi's Speech at a Banquet for Representatives of Islamic Countries</h3>
<p>Stating the Important Significance of Convening the National Assembly</p>
<p>[Report from Nanjing by the Central News Agency, 12th] Minister Bai Chongxi hosted a banquet for envoys of Islamic countries and representatives to the National Assembly at 7 p.m. on the 12th. In his speech, he said: "Dear religious relatives: Today, I sincerely host a banquet for everyone to express my respect to the envoys of various Islamic countries stationed in Beijing and the representatives to the National Assembly of all Islamic faiths in the country. I would like to take this opportunity to introduce the representatives to the foreign guests, based on the meaning of 'all Muslims in the world are brothers.' I feel very happy in my heart.</p>
<p>The convening of this National Assembly is an unprecedented grand event in the history of China for 5,000 years, and its significance is very significant. Since the National Revolutionary Army inherited the teachings of the Founding Father and the leadership of President Chiang of the Kuomintang, after completing the Northern Expedition in the 17th year of the Republic of China, it was envied by Japan, which then triggered China's war against Japan and the Axis powers. Fortunately, with the joint efforts of the United Nations, justice was upheld and complete victory was achieved. Unfortunately, China was starting to build the country when it was disrupted by the Communist bandits. The National Government, in order to rescue the people and complete the revolutionary cause, ordered the mobilization for the suppression of the rebellion. But at this time when the Communist bandits are rampant, why is it necessary to convene this National Assembly? This is entirely because the convening of the National Assembly is a consistent proposition of the National Government, and the purpose is to establish a Republic of China based on the Three Principles of the People. Therefore, the Constitutional National Assembly was convened in the 35th year of the Republic of China to formulate the Constitution. This first National Assembly convened in accordance with the Constitution of the Republic of China is an epoch-making event in Chinese history. After this National Assembly is held, the Kuomintang will return power to the people and become a truly democratic republic.</p>
<p>Among the representatives to this National Assembly, there are about 100 representatives from various parts of the country who believe in Islam, accounting for one-thirtieth of all representatives. This is unprecedented in any previous meeting. In addition to being happy, I am happy to introduce them to my esteemed guests from the same religion."</p>

<h3>US Far East Naval Commander Grafflin Flies to Qingdao</h3>

<p>[Report from Baoding by this newspaper, 12th] A tragic case of a beautiful corpse occurred in Baoding.

The villagers found the buttocks and birth canal in an abandoned bunker and reported the case. Recently, the police station of Hebei Province arrested the two murderers.

<h3>Two or Three Things About Building Walls in the Border City</h3>
<p>— Our reporter, Liu Mengchi</p>
<p>[Our newspaper, Guiyang, 6th dispatch] Xu Fangyuan, the female county magistrate recently appointed to act as the magistrate of Xifeng County in Guizhou, previously participated in the election for the Legislative Yuan of the province. However, because she was nominated by a political party, her qualifications as a candidate were cancelled. She then joined with Lang Boyu, Wang Keqiang, and others who shared the same fate to sue Yuan Shibin, the Director of the Civil Affairs Department of Guizhou Province and concurrently the Chief Executive of the Provincial Election Office, in the Guizhou Higher Court. The details of the case were reported in our newspaper's previous dispatch. The Higher Court immediately accepted the case based on the electoral laws and regulations and began a swift investigation. The court opened an investigation hearing on the afternoon of the 5th and summoned the original plaintiffs and defendants. This democratic lawsuit played out in this quiet and uneventful border mountain city, and because both parties were influential figures in the province, the courtroom was packed with onlookers, far more than usual.</p>
<p>A Democratic Lawsuit: Each Party Holds Their Own Views</p>
<p>At around 2 PM, Li Xuedeng, the president of the Higher Court, personally presided over the trial. The plaintiff, Ms. Xu Fangyuan, stated that she had taken office as the magistrate of Xifeng County two days ago and specially requested Ms. Lin Jiji, a former Construction [unclear character] reporter, to represent her in court. The defendant, Yuan Shibin, arrived at the court on time to await the trial with a composed and generous demeanor. The plaintiff accused the defendant of violating the law in handling the election, arguing that because she and others were nominated by 3,000 signatories to participate in the election for the Legislative Yuan, the Provincial Election Office did not list their names as candidates, which seemed to be a violation of the law. Furthermore, although she and others were members of the Kuomintang, they had already announced their withdrawal from the party in the newspaper and did not want to be bound by the party anymore. The defendant, Yuan Shibin, calmly responded that the reason for not listing their names as candidates was due to the time constraints. The Central Committee issued an order on February 16th, but because the voting dates in all counties of the province were set for February 21st, 22nd, and 23rd, and transportation in Guizhou was inconvenient, it was not easy to notify all counties, so they were not listed as candidates. Although she and others had withdrawn from the party, the withdrawal from the party had to await the approval of the Central Committee. Before the approval, they should still abide by party discipline, so they could not be listed as candidates. The plaintiffs and defendants repeatedly debated for two hours. Finally, the defendant Yuan Shibin replied that even if there was a mistake in this matter, it should be the fault of the General Election Office and the Central Standing Committee. The Provincial Election Office and himself were acting on orders from above, and the Provincial Election Office and himself did not bear any legal responsibility. Afterwards, President Li announced that the case still needed to collect sufficient information before reopening the trial. This democratic lawsuit that caused a sensation in the mountain city was adjourned at 5 PM. According to [unclear character] observers, since the female county magistrate Xu Fangyuan is a key figure in the case, and she has now achieved her goal of becoming a seventh-rank county magistrate, the development of the case will soon be terminated quietly by the plaintiff withdrawing the case or the court issuing a non-prosecution decision.</p>
<p>Elated and Celebrating: Guizhou Native Appointed Chairman</p>
<p>For nearly 14 or 15 years in Guizhou, no local person has presided over provincial affairs. This time, the central government appointed Mr. Gu Zhenglun from Anshun, a native of the province, as the Chairman of the province. When the news arrived, all 11 million people in the province were elated and celebrating, shouting in unison. The current Chairman of Guizhou Province, Mr. Yang Zihui, is from Guang'an, Sichuan. This time, he has been transferred to Changyi City. The central government believes that Mr. Yang has always had the ambition to develop the city. Since Yichang City is an important southwestern town in our country, it is bound to be logical and meritorious for this military and political figure to succeed as mayor and to be promoted to his hometown. Mr. Yang's transfer to Changyi was too sudden. Two days before the decision was made at the Executive Yuan meeting, Mr. Yang learned that it had become a foregone conclusion, so he sent Xiang Leifeng, Deputy Director of the Provincial Government Design and Assessment Committee and concurrently [unclear characters] of Guizhou Daily, to lead a group of personnel to Changyi by special train to handle matters related to the handover. The provincial and municipal governments rushed to handle the handover overnight. After the news was announced on April 2nd, the Provincial Party Headquarters, the Provincial Senate, the Higher Court, and other institutions jointly initiated the preparation of a farewell rally for Chairman Yang Huigong's promotion by all sectors of the provincial capital, which was scheduled to be held on the afternoon of the 10th at the Municipal Gymnasium, which Mr. Yang had painstakingly planned and built not long ago. There were grand ceremonies, Beijing and Sichuan operas, and it was decided to erect a commemorative bronze statue in the riverside park that he personally supervised the construction of. The presidium of the conference included 25 well-known figures from all walks of life. A public banquet was held in the evening with 50 tables. The planned expenses were 25 million yuan. The enthusiasm and solemnity of the farewell mood can be seen from this. Mr. Yang plans to leave Guizhou for Changyi on the 15th. Recently, the farewell parties initiated by various parties have been held seven or eight times a day, with tea and snacks or banquets. Mr. Yang must be present at each place and must give a farewell speech. The people of Guiyang praised Mr. Yang's construction achievements over the years. In particular, when elementary school teachers and students gathered to say goodbye, the guests and hosts burst into tears, which was the most touching. Mr. Yang was determined to build Guizhou with enthusiasm. This year, he originally planned to repair the east-west Zhonghua Heng Road in Guiyang City into a stone street, rebuild the Zhengzhong Bridge on the Nanming River with reinforced concrete, build new sites for model elementary schools in the city center, city east, and city south, and assist in the construction of the National Guiyang Normal College. Most of them have already started construction for more than a month and will soon be engaged in construction. However, the Executive Yuan ordered him to be transferred to Changyi, and he could not stop it. Mr. Yang said to reporters with a sigh, "If I had been given two more years, I would have been able to succeed completely."</p>
<p>Iron-Blooded Soldier: Sobbing and Unable to Finish His Speech</p>
<p>At the farewell banquet of 186 industrial and commercial trade associations, when Mr. Yang delivered his farewell speech, he was an iron-blooded soldier who had dominated the world, and he was so sad that he could not finish his speech. He even extended his departure date until the new Chairman Gu arrived in Guiyang before he left for Changyi. It is reported that Mr. Gu's arrival in Guizhou may be at the end of the month, and the construction of Guiyang can be worked on for another half a month. Mr. Yang is extremely concerned about those who serve in provincial and municipal institutions from the same [unclear character] in Guiyang. It has now been decided that the Guizhou Provincial Highway [unclear character] Transport Office will provide four free [unclear character] for civil servants and their families from [unclear character] who are commuting from Guiyang to Changyi on the daily passenger cars, and free baggage allowance of 30 kilograms, which will be registered by the Guiyang Sichuan Fellow Villagers Association. In order to express his condolences to the members of the provincial and municipal governments for their hard work over the past three years, he decided to allocate ten stones of yellow grain to each person from the remaining provincial administrative expenses for the 36th year, and three stones of yellow grain for public grain from January to March of this year, and also make up for the [unclear character] that was deducted from January to March of this year by 1.5, so that it would be paid in full. Before March, the average monthly salary of municipal government employees was only 700,000 to 800,000 yuan per month, but it was adjusted to 1.4 million to 1.5 million yuan per month yesterday. In this way, before leaving, each provincial and municipal civil servant can earn more than 10 million yuan, which increases their infinite attachment to Mr. Yang's departure.</p>

<h3>Soviet Union Actively Launches "War of Nerves": Traffic Control Extended to Austrian Territory; Traffic to Vienna in British-Occupied Zone Blocked; Soviet Union Demands US and Britain to Close Automobile Repair Stations on Berlin Highway</h3>
<p>[United Press Berlin, 12th dispatch] The Soviet Union has strengthened its actions in German territory over the past ten days, which may make Berlin the Danzig of 1948. According to senior diplomatic figures, Soviet policy is clearly based on "trial and error, trying again if wrong," which may plunge the world into another world war. In the past ten days, it would not have been difficult for slightly nervous Soviet or American soldiers to fire a shot, repeating the tragedy of Sarajevo, Austria, in 1914. Fortunately, the two sides have been deadlocked without firing a shot, and the situation has calmed down.</p>
<p>[Associated Press Berlin, 12th dispatch] Soviet troops set up two checkpoints on the 12th on two highways in the Soviet-occupied zone of Austria used by the British. Over the past two weeks, the Soviet Union's war of nerves against Western countries has extended to Vienna. The Soviet Union's actions in Austria began on the 11th. Six British automobiles, full of military officers, drove to a point 50 miles southeast of Vienna, intending to enter the British-occupied zone. Because the British refused the Soviet Union's request to change to new identification cards, the Soviet army refused the automobiles to pass, and they returned. The war of nerves in Austrian territory continued on the 12th, with the Soviet army setting up a checkpoint on the international highway leading to the British airfield in its territory. Two British trains were blocked in Semmering. The British refused to show their new identification cards, but eventually passed. General Galloway, the British High Commissioner in Austrian territory, originally planned to inspect the British zone, but has now cancelled the plan and returned to Vienna to deal with the situation. At the same time, senior officers of the British and American general staffs held an emergency meeting in Vienna.</p>
<p>[French News Agency Vienna, 11th dispatch] The communist newspaper "People's Voice" published a declaration by the Central Committee of the Austrian Communist Party, headlined with the large characters "Everyone Out for May Day Demonstration," demanding that the people should go out to demonstrate at that time, demanding that the Allied forces withdraw immediately, cancel foreign control, and oppose the delay in signing a peace treaty.</p>
<p>[Reuters Berlin, 11th dispatch] The Soviet authorities have taken new restrictions on land traffic between Berlin and the Western occupation zones, demanding that the British and Americans close the British and American automobile repair stations on the highway passing through the Soviet-occupied zone between Berlin and Heimstedt. On this 160-kilometer-long highway, there are one British and one American rescue station each, 65 miles apart, which have been the resting and repair centers for Allied automobiles passing through the highway for the past two years. The Soviet Union stated when demanding the closure that these repair stations were only allowed to operate in winter. The US authorities have decided to close them starting from April 30th. The British side is still considering its response. After the automobile repair stations are closed, British, American, French, and other non-Soviet automobiles traveling on this sparsely populated highway will have no choice but to travel in convoys to prevent breaking down halfway and having no way to call for help.</p>
<h3>Like a "West Island" in the "East Sea": The British and American Zones Face Isolation; Traffic with Berlin Depends Only on Air Communication</h3>
<p>[Reuters Berlin, 11th dispatch] Berlin has become more like a "West" island in the "East" Sea today. The Soviet Union's refusal to reissue the passes of the technicians who maintain the electrical wires between Britain and the United States and the western zones may cause these telegraph and telephone lines to break down and become unusable. The Soviet Union's demand that the British and Americans close the British and American automobile service stations on the highway between Berlin and the western zones is probably the first step in cutting off road traffic. If so, the Western Allies can only rely on airplanes to connect Berlin with West Germany, but at the same time, it is difficult to guarantee that the Soviet Union will not take action to interfere with this only air connection. The main traffic situation between Berlin and the Western occupation zones is summarized as follows: (1) "Railroad": Allied passenger cars between Berlin and West Germany have been suspended since April 1st. Freight cars entering Berlin are still normal, but those leaving Berlin must have special Soviet permission, which is quite troublesome. (2) "Highway": As of today, passenger cars are still operating normally, but Soviet troops strictly inspect dispatches outside Berlin and at the junction of the occupied zones. Once the British and American automobile service stations are abolished, automobiles whose parts are not absolutely reliable will not be able to travel the entire 190-kilometer route. (3) "Telecommunications Traffic": The Soviet side has requested that the British and American electrical wire maintenance teams stop their activities starting from April 15th. After that, telecommunications traffic between Berlin and the western occupied zones, and even foreign countries, will become increasingly difficult due to damage that cannot be repaired. After the wired telecommunications traffic is blocked, Berlin's wireless equipment will inevitably be unable to accept this large number of telecommunications. Moreover, if the Soviet Union intends to disrupt telecommunications, it will be very easy to disrupt the transmission of wireless communications. (4) "Air Transport": So far, the Soviet Union has shown no signs of interfering with air transport. However, after the [unclear character] incident in Berlin, the Soviet side may take measures to restrict air transport under the pretext of maintaining air safety.</p>
<h3>Averting Humanity's Calamity: Establishing a World Government</h3>
<p>Proposal by the US Committee of Atomic Scientists</p>
<p>[Associated Press Princeton, New Jersey, 11th dispatch] The Emergency Committee of Atomic Scientists, led by Einstein, demanded on the 11th the organization of a world government, because otherwise "our traditional civilization will completely collapse." The committee warned that "today there are two hostile worlds, competing with all their might." It also stated that at this crossroads in history, there are three paths to follow: (1) Launching a preventive war. "When the United States uniquely possesses the atomic bomb, we should proactively choose the time and place to attack potential enemies." (2) Maintaining an armed peace between the two blocs. "However, historically this situation always leads to war." (3) A world government. The committee stated that due to the urgency of the crisis, immediate action should be taken, and indirectly urged President Truman to hold a meeting with Stalin—if necessary, a secret meeting. After the committee's document was released, Einstein told reporters that the United States does not have to give up its knowledge of atomic energy and its monopoly on the atomic bomb.</p>

<h3>Italian Election Campaign in Full Swing: National General Strike for One Hour This Morning</h3>
<p>[United Press Rome, 12th dispatch] The General Confederation of Labor, led by the Communist Party, ordered a national general strike to be implemented for one hour starting at 10 AM this morning to protest the deaths of 35 trade union leaders in Sicily over the past two years. Telephones, trams, buses, and commerce were all shut down. Only railway workers and firefighters were unaffected.</p>
<p>[Reuters Rome, 11th dispatch] The Italian election campaign has reached a fever pitch today, the last Sunday before the general election. Political gatherings are being held from the Alps in the north to the southern tip of Sicily.</p>
<p>The Communist-controlled People's Front issued a declaration yesterday guaranteeing that it would prevent Italy from participating in any group for the purpose of war. The People's Front had previously called for no demonstrations to be held after the election. Therefore, observers believe that the People's Front now feels that it lacks the confidence to win. Prime Minister De Gasperi spoke in Pisa yesterday, solemnly stating: "I dare to assure you that after the election, I will never flee or maintain power by force. Italy is definitely not a Balkan country." Middle- and right-wing newspapers headlined the Soviet Union's veto in the Security Council against Italy's application to join the United Nations as propaganda material for the anti-Communist faction. There was a grand gathering in Milan Cathedral Square, with tens of thousands of pro-Communists from all over Milan province holding Italian flags and red flags, listening to the speech of the Italian Communist leader Togliatti. De Gasperi spoke in Savona today, saying that the Soviet Union also accepted American aid during the war, so Italy's acceptance of American aid today will not hinder its independence.</p>

<h3>Columbia Severes Ties with the Soviet Union; Two Soviets Among Those Arrested for Rebellion; Pan-American Conference Decides to Continue Meeting in Bogota</h3>
<p>[Our Own Dispatch] New York, 12th (Radio): Bogota dispatch reports that representatives of the countries attending the Pan-American Conference are scheduled to meet today to decide the date and location for continuing the conference. Whether the conference can continue in Bogota is highly questionable. Bogota suffered heavy losses after the riots, with all the larger buildings being burned. It is estimated that it will take at least five years to restore the city to its former state. The Communist Party was certainly involved in the riots, but most of the deaths and injuries occurred during looting by the poor masses.</p>
<p>[United Press International, Washington, 12th] The U.S. State Department received a telegram stating that the Colombian government radio announced on the 12th that Colombia has severed diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union. The severance occurred after the announcement on the 11th that two Soviet personnel were arrested for involvement in the Bogota rebellion. The Colombian government radio stated that fifteen foreign personnel, including two Soviets, were caught "on the spot", and several were captured alive. It also stated that three foreign personnel were arrested while creating unrest.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Colombian Capital, 12th] After President Belles's coalition government took office yesterday, martial law was declared in the city and throughout the provinces to restore order. Due to the disruption of food supplies in the city, meat rationing has been implemented and milk distribution is being monitored. Although the unrest is gradually subsiding, public services remain suspended due to the general strike.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Colombian Capital, 12th] Colombian President Belles broadcasted on national radio on the 12th that the communist rebellion had been suppressed by the military and the riots in the city had stopped. The government accused the Communist Party of instigating the murder of Liberal leader Gaitan, as well as the subsequent arson and looting. However, the U.S. delegation led by Marshall has not been able to determine the extent to which the Communist Party and foreign spies directed by Moscow participated in the rebellion. The Communist-controlled labor union is a major component of the Colombian labor movement. The Communist Party secretly distributed leaflets criticizing President as imitating Hitler's tactics, and encouraging workers to continue the general strike to show resistance to reactionaries and American imperialism.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Colombian Capital, 12th] Representatives of the countries attending the Pan-American Conference decided last night to continue the meeting here, moving to another location only when it becomes impossible. A statement was issued after the meeting stating, "The representatives of the Ninth International Conference of American States reaffirm the solidarity of the American peoples and their common historical mission of peace, contributing to the progress and happiness of mankind. The countries involved cannot have their beliefs shaken by any temporary changes in any one of them, and therefore decide to continue their important work to fulfill the entrustment of the governments concerned."</p>
<h3>The Soviet Union Will Continue Repatriating Japanese Nationals from May Onward</h3>
<p>Tokyo Train and Bus Strike</p>

<p>[Associated Press, Tokyo, 11th] Seven electric railway lines and nine tram lines, as well as all bus lines, in Tokyo went on strike for 24 hours on the 11th, causing a major disruption of transportation in the southwest. There are rumors of a complete strike on the 14th. Workers are demanding a 45 percent wage increase, while management has only agreed to a 15 percent increase.</p>
<h3>Ten Thousand People in London Square Watch Ceremony: Roosevelt Statue Unveiled; A Generation's Great Man Remains in People's Memories Forever</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 12th] The statue of Roosevelt, built in Grosvenor Square in London, was unveiled on the 12th, the third anniversary of Roosevelt's death, by Mrs. Roosevelt herself. The statue was made by Sir Dick, and is larger than the late President Roosevelt himself. Those participating in the ceremony included the King and Queen of England, Princess Elizabeth and her husband the Duke of Edinburgh, Prime Minister Attlee, wartime Prime Minister Churchill, other wartime leaders, and the U.S. Marine Corps and British Royal Marines. The King gave a short speech, praising the late Roosevelt as a great man of peace and a great citizen of the world, and said that this memorial statue will be a permanent reminder for generations to come of the partnership between the British and American peoples in the dark days of war. Before the ceremony began, Grosvenor Square was surrounded by a crowd six or seven layers deep, and the surrounding windows and balconies were also occupied by people. When Mrs. Roosevelt stepped onto the steps, the entire square was silent. As the lady pulled the rope, the white curtain fell, and the great bronze statue appeared before the public. The horns sounded in unison, and the audience applauded thunderously. The lady then returned to the palace in a car with the King and Queen. U.S. Ambassador Douglas also gave a short speech, saying that this statue is a symbol of Anglo-American cooperation, and there has never been such complete, harmonious, and successful international cooperation in human history. This is the work of two great wartime giants, Churchill and Roosevelt.</p>
<h3>UN General Assembly to Convene Special Session on Friday to Discuss the Trusteeship of Holy Land; U.S. Representative to Revise Proposal Content</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Lake Success, 12th] Talks are underway behind the scenes here in an effort to avoid a war of words between the United States and the Soviet Union over the position of president of the United Nations Special Assembly. The Special Assembly is scheduled to meet on Friday, and its first task will be to elect a president.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Lake Success, 11th] Hopes for a UN trusteeship over Palestine have dwindled. Representatives of various countries are discussing outside of the meetings the ten measures listed in the U.S. proposal from last Monday, but so far none have yielded any results. Representatives of certain countries and senior officials of the United Nations Secretariat are said to have admitted that trusteeship is no longer sufficient to replace partition as a solution to the Holy Land issue. U.S. Chief Representative Austin, in view of this deadlock, is now planning to make further revisions to the proposal so that it can be accepted by the Security Council and the UN Special Assembly.</p>
<h3>General Chennault on U.S. Policy Toward China</h3>
<p>Copyright by Scripps Howard Newspaper Alliance</p>
<p>Translated by Our Editorial Department</p>
<p>(17) Hesitation in the Face of Events Leads to Missed Opportunities</p>
<p>When General Stilwell, Commander of the China-Burma-India Theater, finally acknowledged the military crisis in China in 1944, he hesitated between helping to save the American air bases in eastern China and humiliating the Chinese government by not providing supplies to China's defenders. He did not handle either option well.</p>
<p>When he finally approved my request to increase air force supplies in June 1944, I pointed out the need to use B-29s to attack the main base of the Japanese offensive in Hunan, Hankou. I urged immediate action, even making it the first task of the Superfortresses, although their intended job was to begin long-range bombing from advanced bases in western China.</p>
<p>At a meeting held in my headquarters on June 6, Stilwell half-accepted this suggestion. My intention was that the Fourteenth Air Force would follow up the attacks by the Superfortresses, bringing its full force to bear on the enemy, helping to break the Japanese base, and assisting the Chinese army in organizing an effective defense in Hunan.</p>
<p>When I suggested that the B-29s take direct action, Stilwell said that he would handle the matter at his headquarters in Burma.</p>
<p>He did ask for instructions from Washington, but his approach did not indicate that there was no other way to expedite matters besides seeking instructions from Washington. In fact, the B-29s did not bomb Hankou until six months later, by which time the Japanese had already opened a mainland corridor through eastern China. Later, even though the B-29s' bombing was very successful, it was only a case of locking the stable door after the horse had bolted.</p>
<p>However, Stilwell did declare a state of emergency in China on June 8. At that time, it was necessary to mobilize almost all available supplies and transportation. However, due to the long-standing neglect of transportation within China, especially the disrepair of the transportation line from Kunming, the terminal of the Hump air transport, to the air bases in Hunan Province, this last-minute effort was also ineffective.</p>
<p>Therefore, it became necessary to send B-24s from the 7th Bombardment Group in India to transport fuel eastward. A large amount of gasoline was consumed in air transport, whereas if land transport had been available, this gasoline could have been used for combat operations to counter the Japanese offensive.</p>
<p>The inability to maintain the eastward transportation line forced us to withdraw our few medium bombers in eastern China, and to limit the activities of fighter planes to the defense of air bases, even though at that time—from July 23 to August 8—the Battle of Hengyang was at its peak, urgently requiring air support, and it was only with air support that this strategic center might have been saved.</p>
<p>On the first day of the siege of Hengyang, I suggested giving 1,000 tons of light automatic weapons and several kinds of infantry weapons of the Fourteenth Air Force to General Xue Yue. I was convinced that if he could be given a small amount of assistance, he would continue to fight.</p>
<p>The Theater Headquarters carefully considered this suggestion. Then Stilwell acknowledged the need to take drastic action, but his intention was to take over command of the Chinese army.</p>
<p>According to news from Chongqing, Stilwell rejected my suggestion. The Theater Headquarters issued a rather vague message, saying that Stilwell was drafting a "proposal" that would humiliate the central government, and that he was unwilling to assist the ground forces in eastern China until his proposal was accepted.</p>
<p>At the same time, officials at the Theater Headquarters in Chongqing began to casually talk about how the Fourteenth Air Force was responsible for defending eastern China without getting help from the Chinese, and that was how the crisis was created.</p>
<p>This casual talk completely ignored the record of my past warnings and requests. In addition, people from the Theater Headquarters casually talked at a banquet at the British Embassy in Chongqing about the Chinese side's "plans to withdraw the wartime capital." One talkative American officer speculated whether the Chinese government would move inland or to New Delhi.</p>
<p>In the second half of July, while Hengyang was putting up a heroic resistance, I requested that transport planes be dispatched to drop ammunition and medical supplies to the defenders of Hengyang, in response to their repeated requests. In answering this request, Stilwell summarized his past attitude towards China and its difficult situation. He said that the result of dropping supplies from the air would be to cause requests for more supplies to be dropped, which could not be met, so he was unwilling to provide planes.</p>
<p>In late July, the Theater Headquarters' attitude was that eastern China had already been lost, and that was how it was officially stated. The Theater Headquarters, ignoring the fact that it had not given material assistance to the troops in eastern China and its neglect of land transport to the point of relying on air transport, thought that the time had come to once again implement "threats, requests, condemnations, and discourteous treatment" towards China. But even the time to do these things was already gone.</p>
<p>The Theater Headquarters had planned to increase the supply of goods transported by land to eastern China to 6,000 tons per month starting in September. If this could have been done earlier, the Japanese offensive could have been checked. But the problem had been delayed for too long.</p>
<p>Eastern China was ultimately lost.</p>
<h3>Prime Minister Schuman Explains French Policy Toward Germany; Opposes Highly Centralized System</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Paris, 11th] Prime Minister Schuman addressed the People's Republican Party Congress in Seine-et-Oise on the 11th, stating that the French government supports the establishment of a West German government after the merger of the three zones, but France still insists that each state within this government should enjoy a high degree of autonomy. Schuman said that the main characteristic of the French government's policy is to be in line with reality, so France has expressed its willingness to assist in the establishment of an international organization that can serve as a major factor for peace. However, France will be one of the vital participants in this policy, not just an echo. Regarding the German issue, a distinction must be made between present and future issues, as well as transitional and definitive solutions. In seeking a new organization for Germany, the existence of the German states must not be forgotten, and it must not be allowed to become a highly centralized nation. The German states have geographical and ethnic differences, and a highly centralized and unified Germany often creates totalitarian regimes. Schuman continued, "France hopes to retain its rights over Germany, continue to remain in Berlin, and demand reasonable compensation and adequate security guarantees. If the four powers fail to reach an agreement, France will be one of the other three powers. France does not want mutually hostile blocs, but France believes that the solution must be able to be obtained in any case.</p>

<h3>Daily Necessities Rationing System; Steering Committee Principally Decided; Provisionally Adding Eight Types; Commissioning Factory Manufacture; Establishing Deliberation Committee to Handle Purchase and Distribution Matters</h3>
<p>[Our Own Dispatch] The Social Affairs Bureau, in order to stabilize the cost of living index, suggested that various factories cooperate in distributing daily necessities to workers. After the establishment of a research association on the compilation of the cost of living index, it organized a daily necessities rationing steering committee after convening talks with various related daily necessities trade associations last week. Yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM, the steering committee held its first meeting at the Social Affairs Bureau. Attendees included Department Head Ding Bingyuan of the Economic Administration Department of the Social Affairs Bureau, Labor Department Head Shen Ding, Section Chief Zou Jinkui of the Third Section, as well as representatives from the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, the Industrial Association, the Cotton Textile Guild of the Six Districts, the Soap Industry, the Dyeing and Weaving Industry, the Underwear Industry, the Knitting Industry, the Tree-Chopping Industry, the Shanghai Cooperative Society Federation, and more than ten other individuals. It was decided in principle that, according to the types and quantities of daily necessities specified in the compilation of the cost of living index, the need would be assessed, and a commission order method would be used to entrust factories to manufacture the goods, which would then be distributed to the workers. In addition to the rice, oil, sugar, and coal balls originally rationed by the government, the types of goods to be rationed provisionally include cloth (divided into local cloth and colored cloth), table salt, soy sauce, firewood, matches, socks, cigarettes, and soap. The quantity of goods to be rationed will be based on the quantity and weighting factors specified in the compiled cost of living index. In order to handle purchase and distribution matters, the steering committee decided to establish a daily necessities purchase and distribution deliberation committee. Its tasks are: (1) To review whether the manufacturing factories meet the conditions. (2) To assess whether the finished products meet the standards. (3) To review the prices of daily necessities. The organization of the committee will involve participation from the Social Affairs Bureau, the Civil Food Allocation Committee, the Central Bank, the Central Trust Bureau, the Central Cooperative Treasury, the Industrial Association, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, and relevant trade associations related to daily necessities. Detailed measures will be further discussed at a meeting to be held on the 20th of this month.</p>
<p>Workers Whose Salaries Are Calculated Based on the Index All Have the Right to Purchase Rations</p>
<p>According to Social Affairs Bureau Director Wu Kaixian's statement to reporters: All workers in this city whose salaries are calculated based on the cost of living index will have the right to purchase rations in the future. As for commercial firms without products to provide for rationing, their workers will still have their salaries calculated based on the cost of living index compiled from the rationed goods. At first glance, it may seem that they only enjoy rights without fulfilling obligations, but if we look at the big picture, the various commercial firms can reduce their expenses, the goods can be sold more cheaply, and the general public can also benefit. Therefore, this is not just a matter for factories and workers, but also a matter related to all citizens of the city. As for cement plants and others without daily necessities to provide for rationing, if factories that manufacture daily necessities need to use cement to build houses, the cement plant should offer it at a lower price. In short, it concerns everyone, and mutual cooperation is required. After the Social Affairs Bureau determines the detailed measures for purchase and distribution, it will convene talks with all industrial trade associations in the city to consult and stipulate the obligations that should be fulfilled, in order to seek mutual assistance and cooperation. As for the matter of the government distributing manufacturing raw materials, this is a major matter, and the Social Affairs Bureau cannot handle it.</p>

The oldest, Wei Ming, is already ten years old. The next, Wei Tai, is seven years old. The third, Wei Shan, is five years old.</p>
<p>On the night of the accident, the deceased's family had not yet received the news. It was not until the next morning that Tang learned of the incident after reading this newspaper. Ding QinFang had been visiting her sister at 49 Fuming Village, Foch Road. On the evening in question, she was preparing to take a tricycle home with her baby when, unexpectedly, she met with misfortune opposite Taiping Garden. However, although Ding and the baby she was holding fell to the ground at the same time, fortunately the baby was unharmed. When reporters visited the bereaved family last night, they witnessed the baby, who had escaped death, still crying for "Mama" despite the grandmother's consolations. The entire family was immersed in an atmosphere of grief and sorrow, which aroused sympathy and indignation.</p>
<p>According to police investigations, there were three trolleybuses traveling south on the night of the accident, and at the same time there were three tricycles traveling north.

<p>Tang Daren told reporters: I hope that those who rode the trolleybus on the day of the accident and those who witnessed the tragic incident can come forward and testify to the truth, to comfort the deceased. He also stated that the driver of the accident-causing trolleybus and the driver of the tricycle have not yet been apprehended, and he further hopes that the police will step up their efforts to arrest them, so that the perpetrators will not remain at large.</p>

<h3>Police Arrest a Major General, Denies Inciting Car Theft</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] The Changshu Police Sub-bureau successively detained car thieves, a Russian named Titov and a Polish man named Dailici, who confessed that a military man surnamed Xue, claiming to be a Major General, incited them to purchase Jeeps for him. Based on the confessions, the section chief used a ruse to arrest Xue yesterday morning at the Kyoto Cafe at No. 6 Tongfu Road. Xue confessed his name was Xue Yichong, 42 years old, from Yancheng, residing at No. 257 Tongren Road, claiming to be a Major General from a certain military organization. He was arrogant and adamantly denied inciting the theft. Since Xue is an active duty military officer, the sub-bureau transferred him to the garrison headquarters for handling.</p>
<h3>Yan Peixing Couple Dispute, Civil Court Hears Case Yesterday, Is He Really Crazy?, Judge Finds it Difficult to Decide, Two Doctors to be Called for Questioning</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] The dispute between Yan Peixing, the male protagonist of the "Mystery of Madness," and his wife Yuan Baoying, was heard for the first time in the Civil Division of the District Court yesterday. Yuan accused Yan of mental loss and neurasthenia, and applied to the court to declare him legally incompetent. Yan arrived at the court yesterday morning with a new haircut and a rosy complexion. Yuan Baoying wore a bun, her face was sallow and thin, with three gold teeth, wearing a black silk cheongsam and bound feet. Both sides retained three lawyers to defend them. The plaintiff's side first hung a large dragon flag on the court wall. The background of the drawing was blue. A sun painted with white powder was in the upper right corner along with ten rays of light. Below the sun was a giant dragon painted with white powder with the words "Heavenly Dragon Lord, Great True Righteousness" written above it, and "Fang Yi" beside it. Many people who heard the news went to listen yesterday, and the small Civil Division 11 was overcrowded.</p>
<p>Eight Pieces of Evidence Presented</p>
<p>Presiding Judge He Xianzhang first questioned Yuan Baoying. Yuan spoke in pure Wuxi dialect, rapidly and incoherently. Halfway through her statement, she suddenly covered her face and cried loudly. She said that the young couple came from Wuxi empty-handed and founded Huaxing Textile and Hardware Factory in the 26th year. In the 29th year, they founded Shengda Factory, and last year, they founded Xingye Steel Wire Heald Factory. Because her husband suffered from mental illness from time to time, he could not manage the factory affairs, resulting in huge losses, so she reported to the police station and sent him to the Puji Hospital psychiatric hospital for treatment. Attorney Li Mo also presented eight pieces of evidence, including bizarre photos and documents. And added the explanation: "The first to fifth pieces of evidence can prove Yan Peixing's mental disorder. The sixth to eighth pieces of evidence can prove that Yan cannot handle affairs, so according to Article 14 of the Civil Code, the court may, at the application of his spouse or two of his closest relatives, declare him legally incompetent."</p>
<p>Handcuffed and Injected</p>
<p>Subsequently, Yan Peixing was called to be questioned. This highly watched "madman" stated his case calmly and with great composure. His answers were also very organized. He said that he was tied into a car by men in military uniforms, with a small car leading the way in front. He was driven to Puji Hospital and forcibly labeled as a madman, handcuffed, and given anesthesia injections. He was imprisoned in the hospital for more than forty days. Later, I begged bitterly, and a doctor surnamed Huang stretched out both hands, asking for one billion yuan. I said I didn't have that much cash, and stretched out one hand to bargain for five hundred million yuan. As a result, he allowed me to communicate with the outside world. I wrote a letter to my sister in my hometown of Wuxi, and Police Chief Zheng of the Garrison Headquarters rescued me. After being discharged from the hospital, I asked Dr. Han, a mental health authority at Gongji Hospital, to examine me and proved that I had no mental illness. I presented Dr. Han's certificate in court.</p>
<p>Answered One by One</p>
<p>He went on to say that the Huaxing, Shengda, and Xingye factories were all operated and managed solely by himself. He also said that the requirement of "being unable to handle one's own affairs" in the declaration of incompetence was not met. He also answered the evidence presented by the plaintiff one by one: (1) The photo of his wife Yuan Baoying worshiping was taken at Yuan's request as a memento of reconciliation. (2) The warrant was from Guanfang. (3) The Heavenly Dragon was used as a trademark. The defendant's lawyer, Zhou Xiaoshan, stood up and said: After the court's one-hour interrogation of the defendant, his answers were orderly and showed no signs of mental illness. His wife, Yuan Baoying, has carefully collected all the games and brushstrokes over time, which shows that she has been planning for a long time, purely out of malice. It is obvious that this case is an organized and planned scheme to seize money and property. The court will question Dr. Huang Yingbang of Puji Hospital and Dr. Han of Gongji Hospital in this case and adjourned for further trial.</p>

<h3>Tongji University Student Unrest Case Concludes; Students Request Early Resolution Due to Impending Graduation; Court Orders All to be Returned to Custody; Sentence to be Announced on the 16th</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] The court heard the case of students of Tongji University being accused of assaulting Mayor Wu, which began at 9:00 AM yesterday and concluded with closing arguments at around 1:00 PM. The sentencing has been scheduled for the morning of the 16th. Yesterday, the court was heavily guarded. One squadron of riot police and all court police officers were deployed to maintain order. Admittance required a spectator's pass. However, students from various schools did not arrive in groups, and the number of spectators was less than last time, so the order was exceptionally good. At 9:00 AM, Judge Hu Zhichao, accompanied by Prosecutor Gu Ruilin, ascended the bench in Criminal Division 2 and ordered the defendants Huang Kelu, Pan Chengbang, Feng Liwen, Wang Zhongshu, Wang Weixin (front row), Zhang Jingyao, Xiong Zonglie, Wang Gongwei, Zhou Yongzhi, Sun Kejia, and Qu Yuping (back row) to be brought into court. Witnesses Zhang Jugong, Jiang Hong, Zhu Huiru, and Liu Shuangqiu were summoned, but only Zhang Jugong arrived. After Judge Hu briefly questioned him, Prosecutor Gu stood up to deliver his indictment, stating that the defendants were all young students and had no major malice, and requested leniency. Then each defendant began to argue his case. Huang Kelu argued, "The members of the Student Self-Government Association represent the opinions of the students and execute the decisions of the General Assembly, and there was no intention to incite." Pan Chengbang denied assaulting the mayor. Feng Liwen said, "The members of the Self-Government Association were elected from the bottom up. The petition was the public opinion of the students, and there was no incitement." Wang Zhongshu said: "Huang and Ma's views are the same." Wang Weixin said: "I am not a member of the Self-Government Association. The commander-in-chief of the petition delegation to Nanjing was temporarily appointed, it was just a formality and did not issue any marching orders." At this time, Mayor Wu's adjutant, Zhang Jugong, suddenly arrived in court to testify, first pointing out that the five defendants Feng Liwen, Pan Chengbang, Wang Weixin, Qu Yuping, and Sun Kejia were present at the scene at the time. When pointing to Qu Yuping, he blurted out his name. Because Qu had taken off his glasses, Zhang was not sure, and pointed to Wang Weixin as Qu. At that time, Qu's defense lawyer, Yu Chengxiu, stood up and asked, "Who exactly is Qu Yuping?" Zhang ultimately misidentified him as Qu, and then said, "Because two months have passed, I don't remember clearly. I can only prove that these five people were all present at the scene, as for who laid hands on the mayor, I dare not definitively prove it. Inspector Zhu Yifu of the police station and I were always together protecting Mayor Wu." At this point, the debate continued. Zhang Jingyao said: "What I was holding was the flag of the 3rd Detachment, not the flag of the petition delegation." Xiong Zonglie said: "I did not participate in the petition, I did not shout slogans, and I am only two months away from graduation, please resolve this matter as soon as possible." Wang Gongwei said: "I have been expelled from the school and have been detained for more than two months. According to the witness's testimony, the defendant was not present at the scene. I request compensation for all academic and spiritual losses." Zhou Yongzhi denied assaulting the mayor. Sun Kejia said: "I am a student at St. John's University. Because Wang Zhenli, a classmate at St. John's, was arrested, I asked Mayor Wu about it. Mayor Wu had agreed to release him. At this time, the police cavalry suddenly charged, and the order was in chaos. Because I was not feeling well, I dodged aside and did not assault the mayor at all." Qu Yuping said: "I had no motive to hit the mayor, nor did I take any action to hit the mayor." After all the defendants had argued their cases, the defense lawyers stood up to defend them. The court ruled that the case would be sentenced on the 16th. The defendants' request for bail was denied, and they were returned to custody.</p>

<h3>Former Director of the Executive Yuan Accused of Assault and Bigamy</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] Liu Qiqin, 37 years old, Shanghai native, former director of the Supply Department of the Executive Yuan's Relief and Rehabilitation Administration, was formerly in love with Zhu Zhenyi, (25 years old, Suzhou native), a female employee of the Supply Department.

<h3>Cotton Yarn Turns Strong After Weakness, Cloth Fluctuates Narrowly, Trade is Quiet</h3>
<p>Yesterday's yarn market, turned strong after weakness, and the results were mixed. At the opening, the demand from guest merchants was sluggish, and local merchants were also waiting and seeing, so all grades opened at low levels. 42s Blue Phoenix opened in the morning at 227 million, and 21s Double Horse opened at 147 million. But sales were not smooth, and the shorts took the opportunity to sell, and the market gradually declined. The former fell as low as 224 million. When it was about to close, news of bullish buying spread frequently, and the shorts were nervous and rushed to cover their positions, and the market regained its upward trend. It finally closed at 232 million, up 2 million from last weekend. The latter ended at 150 million, also up 2 million. Except for the Blue Phoenix, which rose by 2 million, the other 40s yarns hovered in a weak state. Except for the Double Horse and Big Airship, which fell, all the other 20s yarns rose by 1 million to 5 million each.</p>
<p>The cotton cloth market fluctuated narrowly yesterday, and trade was quiet. The demand from guest merchants was very scarce, and cloth merchants successively locked in profits. Dyeing factories had little interest, and only individual retail investors bought at low prices. When it was about to close, news of bullish buying spread frequently, and the market was quite stable. The opening price of 12-pound Longtou fine cloth in the morning was 4.85 million yuan, once fell as low as 4.82 million yuan, retail investors bought, and closed at 4.84 million yuan. The fine cloth and Yuan Biji quota orders supplied by the Fangjian Company on Saturday were all posted upside down by 50,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Fangjian Sells Yarn</p>
<p>[Our Dispatch] Fangjian Company sold yarn as usual yesterday (11th), a total of 11 types. There were 605 purchase orders, and 1132 pieces of cotton yarn were sold, equivalent to 1972 pieces of 20s yarn.</p>

<h3>Rayon Fluctuates Narrowly, Factory Silk and Silk Goods are Stable</h3>
<p>The rayon market fell slightly yesterday, with no major ups and downs throughout the day, about 2 million yuan lower than last Saturday. No. 120 Xuzi Youguang opened in the morning at 236 million yuan, once fell to 34 million yuan, and closed at 35 million yuan at noon for the spot price. It once reached 9 million yuan in the afternoon, and finally fell back to the morning closing price of 35 million yuan.</p>
<p>Factory Silk</p>
<p>The market was firm yesterday. There were no transactions for CD grade 5 dan goods. The asking price was the same as last Saturday. High retail C-grade goods were priced at 370 million yuan, but the payment period was 40 days. A transaction was also made at 60 million yuan for the spot price. Qianjing was weak yesterday, with high retail prices around 280 million yuan.</p>

<h3>Hangzhou New Longjing Arrives in Shanghai</h3>
<p>Opening Price 1.6 Million Yuan Per Jin</p>
<p>After being expected for many days among industry peers, this year's Hangzhou Longjing has finally arrived in Shanghai with a hundred or so jin, reporting new prices. The opening price reached its peak, as high as 1.6 million yuan per jin. However, the base is difficult to stand firm. The reason is that at present, all parties are rushing to be the first to sell new tea, and they are all willing to pay high prices. But as more sources arrive later, it is inevitable that the price will fall in a straight line. As for the old goods, the holders are still trying to hold onto them because of the scarcity of goods, so many domestic tea buyers are waiting and seeing. As for export tea, although there is still urgent demand overseas, exporters are hesitant, and the situation is that both entry and exit are scarce, and the trade is greatly reduced. However, the market is still standing firm as before.</p>
<p>In addition, since the Farmers Bank has launched tea loans, tea merchants have benefited greatly. And now it is the season for tea sales, so in recent days, people in the industry have been frequently in need of funds, and hope that it will proceed quickly according to last year's methods, so as not to hinder this year's tea production and sales.</p>
<h3>Small Rice Crop Reports Lead to Strong Selling Pressure, Rice Prices Trend Downward Again; Special High-Grade Rice Falls Below the Four Million Mark</h3>
<p>The rice market continues to show weakness. This morning, sellers offered lower prices based on the previous day's falling Shanghai and Wuxi prices, indicating strong selling intentions. The market continued its downward trend from last week, falling further. Due to weak demand locally, sales were slow, leading to a pessimistic outlook. In the South Market, white rice and thin-husked rice each fell by 100,000 yuan, while early rice fell by 50,000 to 100,000 yuan. Limited supply of "Yin Bai" rice led to market stabilization. Only unpolished indica rice remained stable. In the North Market, except for high-grade white rice, which remained steady, all other types fell by 50,000 yuan. Special high-grade rice fell below the four million yuan mark. Yesterday, the total arrivals in the North and South Markets were 6,752 shi (石, a unit of dry measure).</p>
<p>Flour</p>
<p>Flour prices followed the downward trend of rice prices, further depressed by the weak prices in Shanghai and Wuxi. Market sentiment was low, and wholesalers showed no interest, leading to sluggish retail sales. Transactions were small and prices continued to decline. The market was flooded with "Red Bee" brand flour, and selling by small retailers caused prices to fall by 55,000 yuan. "Battleship" and "Old Car" brands each fell by 40,000 yuan, while miscellaneous brands were relatively stable. Bran, in contrast to flour, rose in price due to rumors of purchases by the China Trust Bureau. Large bags of bran jumped by 40,000 to 50,000 yuan, while wheat prices remained unchanged.</p>
<p>Grains</p>
<p>Mixed fortunes were seen in the grains market. Although local demand for soybeans was weak, demand from wholesalers kept prices stable. Transactions of Pinghu black beans had been lacking for a long time, but yesterday they traded at 3 million yuan, with supply and demand for selected green beans being equal. Red sorghum and corn initially remained steady but later fell by 30,000 to 50,000 yuan. Tea beans were mediocre. Sesame seeds saw inquiries from dealers in Tianjin, pushing prices up by 100,000 to 200,000 yuan. Raw peanuts were bought by dealers from Guangdong, increasing prices by 200,000 to 400,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Cooking Oil</p>
<p>The market trended downward. Due to increased arrivals, the price of raw oil fell more than that of soybean oil. Qingdao "Ji" brand raw oil was priced at 9.65 million yuan, a decrease of 150,000 yuan. Jiangbei "Ji" brand raw oil initially traded at 9.45 million yuan. Soybean oil factories rarely offered new supplies, and recycled soybean oil traded at 8 million and 8.05 million yuan, a decrease of about 50,000 yuan. Rapeseed oil fell by 50,000 yuan, while small-batch sesame oil remained stable. Soybean cakes were bought by dealers from Quanzhou, who favored large-batch cakes, leading to a price of 990,000 yuan. All other soybean cakes remained stable.</p>
<h3>Rice Prices Decline in Shanghai and Wuxi</h3>

<h3>Java Chinese Team Flies to Hong Kong This Morning, Losing to Chinese Mixed Team Before Departure</h3>
<p>The Java Chinese football team arrived in Shanghai from Hong Kong on the 7th. In five days, they played four matches. In the first match, they defeated the Railway team 3-1. However, they lost to Qingbai with the same score. The third match against Donghua ended in a 3-3 draw. Yesterday, in the final match against the Chinese mixed team, they lost 3-1. The Java team, exhausted and depleted, suffered another defeat. The first half ended with the Chinese mixed team leading 1-0. In total, the Java Chinese team had one win, one draw, and two losses in Shanghai. Although the results were not great, their fighting spirit was quite strong. After four consecutive days of intense battles, it was indeed not easy, and their excellent sportsmanship won high praise in Shanghai. The visiting team has completed its tour and is scheduled to take a China National Aviation Corporation plane to Hong Kong at 9:00 AM this morning to catch a ship leaving Hong Kong tomorrow to return to Java.</p>
<p>Yesterday, thousands of spectators attended, generating a ticket revenue of 360 million and one yuan. Zhang Mingkun, the most valuable defender of the Java team, was unable to play due to injury and was replaced by Fu Furui, resulting in a less solid defense than in previous matches. The Chinese mixed team's offense was very strong. In the 30th minute, Sun Laojin received a wonderful pass from Nippo and quickly advanced. Java's goalkeeper Wang Wenchen suffered a relapse of his old injury and prematurely moved forward, allowing Laojin to break through and score. The Java team trailed by one goal in the first half.</p>
<p>In the second half, the Chinese mixed team made major adjustments, with Afu leading the attack, Xue Peiran filling Afu's vacated position, and Jin Lusheng being benched. The Java team's fatigue became apparent, and the situation did not improve. In the 12th minute, Sun Laojin also retired, and Chen Mingzhe replaced him as the right inside forward. Qu Yongfu made waves and scored a powerful shot from the penalty spot, making it 2-0. Java launched a counterattack, and in just two minutes, Hu Jinli dribbled past Chen Jiawan and shot into the net from the right corner, making it 2-1. After that, the game gradually eased, and both sides failed to score, ending the game 2-1.</p>

<h3>Government Monthly Fees Are Already High; Difficult to Change Self-Funded Students to Public Funding; Deputy Minister Hang of the Ministry of Education Issues Statement Yesterday</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, April 12th] Hang Liwu, Deputy Minister of the Ministry of Education, stated at 5:00 PM on the 11th regarding the recent petitions from various colleges and universities regarding treatment and public funding issues: (1) Regarding the requests from various schools to improve treatment and grading issues, the government has adjusted treatment according to the cost of living index in various regions in April. The grading of each region is determined according to local prices, and the Ministry of Education can only make recommendations within the realm of what is possible. For example, the academic research fee for teachers above the junior college level has recently been approved by the Executive Yuan to be doubled: 1 million yuan for professors, 800,000 yuan for associate professors, 600,000 yuan for lecturers, and 400,000 yuan for teaching assistants, effective from March. Anhui University has already applied. Counselor Liu is currently handling the issue at Zhongzheng University. (2) Regarding the request from self-funded students to become publicly funded, because it currently costs about 250 million yuan per publicly funded student, and there are 300,000 central and provincial publicly funded students, the government monthly fees are already high, and it is impossible to change self-funded students to public funding. However, for truly poor students, schools themselves, such as Peking University, can find ways to provide welfare and assistance, which is one way to help.</p>
<h3>Acting President Qi of Central University Meets with Students on Hunger Strike</h3>

After the meeting, the entire group marched five li (里, a unit of distance) from Dingjiaqiao to the main campus on Sipailou. They requested to see Counselor Sha but were informed that Sha had left. The students then went to the classroom where Acting President Qi was teaching. At 12:00 PM, after Qi finished teaching, he continued to talk with the students in the classroom. Qi strongly explained the national financial difficulties and the school's insufficient funding, stating that although he sympathized with the students, he was unable to provide assistance, and it was impossible to change them to public funding. Qi left at 2:00 PM. The students then returned to the Jiashan Branch at 4:00 PM, but the petition was still unsuccessful.</p>
<h3>Property Tax for Educators: City Principals Urge Exemption. [United China News Agency]</h3>
<p>The sixtieth symposium of principals of municipal secondary and higher schools in the city discussed the proposal by the Shanghai Direct Tax Bureau of the Ministry of Finance to resume collecting income tax on teachers' salaries and remuneration. It was unanimously agreed that the impoverished living conditions of educators are well known. Although they were ordered in January of this year to calculate salaries based on the cost of living index, only one-tenth of each person's base salary, excluding thirty yuan, was retained. The remaining nine-tenths were essentially donated entirely due to the government's financial difficulties. Therefore, it was resolved to request the Municipal Education Bureau to forward a request to the Municipal Government to consult with the Shanghai Direct Tax Bureau of the Ministry of Finance, asking them to consider the difficult times and grant an exemption.</p>

<p>Talking About New Medicine and New Drugs</p>
<p>Spitting and Coughing by Liang Junqing</p>
<p>Recently, many people have been advocating a "No Spitting Campaign." One can see signs prohibiting spitting in the streets and alleys. It is evident that Shanghai people are beginning to learn about hygiene. This is a more progressive expression in the democratic tide, and it is worthy of our support.</p>
<p>However, in this "No Spitting Campaign," many people will naturally raise many questions: "Why is it bad to spit when one has phlegm in the throat?" "What harm does spitting on the ground cause?" "What bacteria does phlegm contain?" "What dangers do these bacteria pose to people?" If these questions cannot be answered in detail, then relying solely on posting signs will not be effective. Therefore, I have specifically written this short article to respond to this "No Spitting Campaign."</p>
<p>We all know that spitting on the ground is not good. However, it is really difficult to bear having phlegm stuck in the throat without spitting it out, so many people spit it out even though they know it is not good. This stems from the automatic action of the respiratory tract expelling secretions, which is unavoidable. However, we must also understand that the production of phlegm is due to excessive secretion by cells in the lungs and the mucous membrane of the trachea. Although there are many causes for this excessive secretion (such as pneumonia, tuberculosis, emphysema, bronchitis, tracheitis, laryngitis, pharyngitis, etc.), some can transmit germs to others, causing nearby friends to suffer from the same disease, while others may not transmit germs to people. However, because the germs contained in phlegm are sometimes very serious, and we have no way to distinguish whose phlegm contains germs and whose phlegm is free of germs, we hope that everyone will refrain from spitting phlegm on the ground casually to avoid transmitting germs to others. If one must spit phlegm, then it is best to spit it into a spittoon or into a small handkerchief brought along, and then find a way to disinfect it. As for people who frequently need to spit phlegm, we advise them to immediately seek medical treatment, because healthy people do not have phlegm.</p>
<p>Someone might ask me, "What harm does spitting phlegm on the ground cause?" This question is easy to answer. After phlegm is spat on the ground, it is dried by sunlight and absorbed by the air, naturally becoming phlegm residue. This phlegm residue is very light and floats in the air with dust. Although some of the germs in it have died due to sunlight and air drying, most of the germs still have the ability to live. If this phlegm residue is inhaled into the lungs, then the germs in it can certainly make people sick. Therefore, phlegm cannot be spat on the ground.</p>
<p>As for what germs are in phlegm? According to bacteriologists, there can be a great many germs in phlegm. Although many germs in phlegm spat on the ground have died due to sunlight and air drying, the remaining germs, such as diphtheria bacilli, tubercle bacilli, plague bacilli, glanders bacilli, anthrax bacilli, meningitis bacilli, pertussis bacilli, influenza viruses, measles viruses, smallpox viruses, and scarlet fever bacteria, are already enough to make us suffer. Therefore, we must never forget the highly contagious nature of phlegm spat on the ground, and we must be vigilant at all times, find ways to avoid it at all times, and eliminate it at all times.</p>
<p>Regarding the issue of phlegm disinfection, I think it can be discussed in several ways. For example, for phlegm in a handkerchief, it is best to boil it in hot water for twenty or thirty minutes. If it is phlegm in a paper bag, then it is best to burn it, because it is done once and for all; burning it burns everything away. As for using disinfectant to disinfect, there are considerable difficulties, because the presence of protein in phlegm makes it very difficult to disinfect. If a 5% "Lysol" solution is used, it must be soaked for twelve hours to achieve disinfection. Other disinfectants also require waiting for more than ten hours to be effective. The difficulty of using disinfectants is thus evident.</p>
<p>Finally, regarding coughing, I think it is necessary to remind everyone. Because coughing can transmit various germs more severely, and the general public is careless, coughing casually in public places (such as theaters, lecture halls, trams, buses, and trains, playgrounds, etc.) exposes others to many germs (such as cholera vibrio, pneumonic plague bacillus, influenza viruses, diphtheria bacilli, pneumococci, and tubercle bacilli, etc.) that can be directly inhaled into the lungs through droplets, thus causing illness, which is truly extremely dangerous. According to examinations by bacteriologists and hygiene experts, germs can be transmitted to others within a distance of two or three meters during a single cough. Also, one drop (one-thousandth of a gram) of phlegm can contain 5,000 to 100,000 tubercle bacilli. The severity of coughing in terms of transmission is thus evident. When infectious diseases are prevalent, people in Europe and America often wear masks, both to prevent transmission from others and to avoid transmitting to others. This is the most hygienic method. Since Chinese people do not have the habit of wearing masks, covering one's mouth with a hand or a handkerchief when coughing is a relatively proper measure.</p>

<p>Complaints of a Rural Doctor by Chen Guanyi</p>
<p>I previously read the articles by Mr. Hua Xiren and Mr. Xu Jin in the "New Medicine and New Drugs Weekly" section of Shen Bao about the issue of medical personnel going to rural areas, which were wonderfully detailed. My relative, a doctor, practices medicine in a county on the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway. His clinic and my residence are in the same household. Based on my actual observations, I venture to write about the joys and hardships of a rural doctor.</p>
<p>In terms of habits, people in Shanghai refer to nearby foreign areas, whether they are towns or counties, as the countryside. However, people in towns and counties are accustomed to referring to farming villages as the countryside and do not consider themselves to be in the countryside. The so-called medical personnel going to the countryside must refer to towns and counties. Truly rural areas, with only a few households or dozens of households, naturally cannot sustain a doctor's practice. There are many villages surrounding each town and county, ranging from a few miles to ten or twenty miles away, connected by waterways or small roads. The towns and counties serve as exchange points for agricultural and industrial products. In addition to local residents, doctors' practices rely heavily on farmers from the villages.</p>
<p>Doctors in counties and cities must first endure a life without material civilization, such as cars, electricity, running water, electrical appliances, Western-style houses, etc. Secondly, if the area for house calls is in the countryside, patients who can reach waterways will naturally use boats to transport the doctor, but they are all without awnings, and the doctor must be able to withstand wind and sun. For those without access to waterways, the doctor must exert his legs, for a distance of five or ten miles, which is uncertain. However, the house call fee is only a meager amount, perhaps not much higher than the standard consultation fee in Shanghai. Rural areas are poor and cannot be compared to large cities.</p>
<p>Most counties and cities in the interior lack hospitals. Even if there are, they are hospitals in name only but private clinics in reality, with a pitifully small scale. Pharmacies only sell common over-the-counter drugs, and most drugs are unavailable, with no prescription services. Therefore, doctors must prepare various drugs themselves and must also know how to mix and prepare medicines. The situation where a doctor can diagnose a patient and give him a prescription to finish the matter, as in Shanghai, is not feasible in the interior. One must be able to treat many subjects, preferably internal and external medicine, as well as ophthalmology, otolaryngology, gynecology, pediatrics, etc. The examination and culture of patients' stool, urine, pus, sputum, and bacteria, etc., cannot be resolved because there are no laboratories. For the diagnosis of the condition, one can only rely on experience and other symptoms to determine, which is very inconvenient. In addition, X-rays and electrotherapy equipment and major and minor operations cannot be performed due to the lack of necessary equipment and can only be politely declined. Also, for private clinics to stock medicines, it is impossible not to stock certain drugs. However, it may be many months without the opportunity to use the drug. If it is stored for a long time without being used, it is easy to spoil, unlike hospitals or pharmacies, which can constantly introduce new products due to the large number of patients. Furthermore, some villagers are accustomed to consulting traditional Chinese medicine first when they are sick. If the treatment is ineffective, they resort to witchcraft. Only after the condition becomes serious do they consult Western medicine, with high expectations. However, at this time, treatment is often difficult to succeed. The above are all the hardships of rural doctors.</p>
<p>As for the joys, in large ports such as Beijing and Shanghai, because there are too many doctors, the supply exceeds demand. Except for a small number, many doctors do not have a regular and stable income from their practices and often worry about making a living. However, in the interior, there are too few doctors, so there are generally no problems in terms of medical practice. In large cities, ordinary patients or dignitaries often lack respect and trust in most doctors due to their arrogance or the bad impression created by the behavior of one or two unscrupulous doctors who value money over ethics. They are also prone to belittling clinics that are slightly old and narrow or doctors who lack a grand demeanor. However, people in the interior mostly have great respect and faith in doctors. They rarely interfere with treatment, and after recovery, they often feel grateful to the doctors, treating them like friends. It is not the case that they become strangers after one parting. It is more convenient to find a house than in Shanghai, and the air is fresh, the residence is quiet, the social life is simple, the people's hearts are less cunning, and it is easy to deal with, unlike Shanghai, where there are thorns everywhere and unpredictable changes.</p>
<p>The above is just a rough outline. If the country can achieve peace, political clarity, and rapid construction in the future, and material civilization facilities such as roads, highways, water and electricity, and modern enterprises such as hospitals and pharmacies are widely developed, then doctors practicing medicine in the interior can reduce many difficulties, and it will be easier to protect the health of the nation.</p>

<p>Academic Learning, Scholarship and Democracy by Xie Youwei</p>
<p>As the National Assembly is in session, seeking to lay the foundation for democracy in our country, it seems necessary for those of us engaged in academic study to say a few words. Whether we are satisfied or dissatisfied with this conference, at the very least, it is a manifestation of democratic politics in form. We should recognize the significance of this conference with the spirit of seeking truth in academic study, a spirit unswayed by partisan views or prejudices, and strive to lay an unshakable foundation for democracy in our country.</p>
<p>People in academic circles are rich in ideals. People rich in ideals are often dissatisfied with reality. Due to dissatisfaction with the current reality of politics, we can easily transfer this dissatisfaction to this conference. This is natural and not surprising. However, we must know that academic thought and democratic politics are mutually causal and mutually needed. Without academic thought suitable for the development of democratic politics, democratic politics will not easily occur, not easily grow, and not easily reach the ideal. Conversely, without a democratic political environment suitable for the development of academic thought, academic thought will not have the possibility of being promoted and developed. The author wishes to briefly discuss these two points to inform the people of the country.</p>
<p>Among the countries with modern democratic politics, the most successful is undoubtedly England. The success of English democratic politics is definitely not a matter of a single day but is closely related to English academic thought. Only with English academic study can there be English democracy. It is English academic study that laid the theoretical foundation for English democratic politics. Without the empiricism of Locke and Hume, without the utilitarianism of Bentham and Mill, without the new idealism of Green and Bradley, there would be no English democracy today, or at least, there would be no such success as today. For what democratic politics emphasizes is individual equality, individual freedom, and the full and complete development of the individual. In other words, it is individualism. Democratic politics can be said to be the politics of individualism. Without regard for the individual, without obliterating the individual, there is no democratic politics to speak of. English empiricism and utilitarianism are rooted in individualism, and English new idealism is also rooted in individualism. However, the former refers to the individual as a separate and independent entity, while the latter refers to the individual as inseparable from the group. Liberalism and capitalism arise from empiricism and utilitarianism; Liberalism also arises from new idealism, but individual freedom must be slightly restricted by the group and must take into account the welfare of the whole. In this way, capitalism cannot use freedom as an excuse and must be subject to state control. The ability of English democratic politics to shift from emphasizing political democracy to also emphasizing economic democracy can be said to be the credit of new idealism. Empiricism and utilitarianism laid the foundation for political democracy in England, while new idealism laid the foundation for economic democracy in England. Is this not clear evidence that academic study helps democracy?</p>
<p>Conversely, without the environment of English democratic politics, there would be no English academic study, and there would be no such rich and brilliant academic study. The most important condition for the development of academic study is freedom, the freedom of thought for thinkers. Without freedom of thought, there is no academic study to speak of. Prescribing a certain kind of thought and only allowing thinkers to think within this thought system is not freedom of thought. Any thought system or any theory is an object of thought for thinkers. Its rightness or wrongness can only be determined through the thinker's reflection. It is absolutely impossible to force thinkers to accept a thought system without their reflection. This is thought control, is the suicide of thought, and is definitely not freedom of thought.</p>
<p>For the development of academic thought, thinkers must have the freedom to contemplate any thought system. Even ideas that we usually consider incorrect and harmful should be allowed to be contemplated by thinkers to a certain extent. For example, the doctrines of Hegel and Marx are considered by some to be anti-democratic, erroneous and harmful. But in the democratic political environment of England, Marx was able to freely complete his Capital in London, and Hegel could also be studied and welcomed in England. By doing so, the British government did not become communist or dictatorial but instead fostered many scholars with learning and thought. If England were not democratic but dictatorial, like fascism, then Marx would have been expelled, and Hegel's works would have been banned. Many famous British scholars, such as Green, Bradley, Russell, and Laski, would not have had the possibility of appearing. Is this not clear evidence that democracy helps academic study?</p>
<p>Therefore, what the author hopes of the academic community is to vigorously promote and cultivate academic thoughts related to democracy; what I hope of the National Assembly representatives and government figures is to strive to create an environment that facilitates the development of academic study. In the current environment, it is impossible to talk about academic study. The academic community is suffering from making a living, too busy saving lives to spare time for academic pursuits. However, if we talk about democracy without talking about academic study, then democracy is also empty.</p>
<p>The Nature of Aristotle's Thought by Yan Qun</p>
<p>There are two aspects of Aristotle's thought that are worth noting:</p>
<p>(1) Regarding inheritance from Plato:—The so-called inheritance is not like a wastrel descendant inheriting the ancestral property, not knowing how to manage it himself, and only considering it his duty to preserve it without losing it. Aristotle's inheritance from Plato not only digested what he inherited but also developed it himself. He deeply believed that all phenomena in the universe must be transformed into concepts to become knowledge. This is the part he digested from what he inherited. At the same time, he also felt Plato's shortcomings. These shortcomings were the undertaking that Plato should have done but did not do. Previously, Socrates discovered the need to seek concepts, believing that this was the true method of knowledge, but he was, after all, a beginner and not bold enough, so he only delineated a corner of the human affairs realm as the scope of research. Plato saw this shortcoming and wanted to extend it to the entire universe, but his contribution stopped at discovering that everything in the universe has concepts (which he called Ideals). It must be known that the original intention of seeking concepts is to obtain knowledge. Knowledge is nothing more than an explanation of the vast array of phenomena. Therefore, seeking concepts is to explain those phenomena. Plato already knew that the scope that concepts could explain was not limited to a corner of the human affairs realm, and its use could extend to everything in the universe. However, he only saw it but did not actually do it. Herein lies Aristotle's contribution. He felt that Plato's shortcoming was here, and the unfinished undertaking was also here. Therefore, he assumed this responsibility and actually used concepts to explain everything in the universe. By doing so, he opened the door for science and laid a good foundation. This was his achievement in seizing Plato's territory and developing it himself.</p>
<p>(2) Regarding self-creation:—As said just now, Aristotle's goal was to actually use concepts to explain everything in the universe. How exactly did he explain it? To answer this question, it can be divided into two aspects: (1) The methodological aspect:—Plato's method of learning was dialectics. The form of dialectics is question and answer, and the content is analysis and synthesis, which is actually the embryonic form of induction and deduction. Aristotle carried forward this method, developing it into a specialized methodology called Logic. This was his first step in creation. But he was still dissatisfied. He believed that logic was not enough and that actual observation was also needed to have new discoveries. Although, due to the limitations of the times, he could not use the experimental method commonly used by modern scientists, and he could not collect materials and facts in a controlled environment, he could only observe in a scattered natural environment. However, this alone laid a solid foundation for the scientific methods of later generations. This was his second step in creation. (2) The content aspect:—After Plato discovered that everything in the universe has concepts, he placed the concepts in another world, forming a confrontational relationship with the actual natural world. Aristotle did not think so. He believed that the function of concepts was originally to explain phenomena, but now, on the contrary, separating them from phenomena, with a vast gap between the two, would be equivalent to being useless, equivalent to not having any explanation. Therefore, he pulled the concepts into the natural world and made them truly explain the natural world. He never believed in independent, self-existing Ideals forming another world. At the same time, he firmly believed that everything in the universe can be explained by concepts. He believed that having concepts without facts makes the concepts empty, and having facts without concepts makes the facts meaningless. This was his greatest dedication, because it found a way out for science and a use for philosophy.</p>
<p>Summarizing the above two points, it can be seen that Aristotle's philosophy is rationalism on the one hand and empiricism on the other. The former is the part he inherited from Plato, and the latter is the part he created himself. Empiricism is his means, and rationalism is his purpose. This is the true essence of a scientist. A scientist is not just in the room using reason to explain the universe. Every move he makes must be based on facts obtained from experience. However, everyone often thinks that scientists only describe but do not explain, so what he obtains are only empirical facts. In fact, this view is wrong. Scientists do not always explain, but the phenomena he explains are only local, and the reasons he explains are not final, that is all.</p>
<p>Schopenhauer's Theory of Art by Shaoxiong</p>
<p>Arthur Schopenhauer, a German philosopher of the nineteenth century, was a philosopher who had great research on art. In his philosophical theory, art occupies a very important position. According to his philosophy, he wants to negate life and negate the will to live, and he believes that art is a way to negate the will to live, although not a fundamental way. In art, we can temporarily forget the will to live, we can temporarily obtain liberation and transcendence. This is the main reason why Schopenhauer attaches importance to art. This article does not elaborate on Schopenhauer's artistic aspirations, but only translates a chapter "The Metaphysics of Pure Art" in Schopenhauer's collection of treatises, so that the general reader can get some fundamental concepts of Schopenhauer's theory of art.</p>
<p>In the above-mentioned thesis, Schopenhauer considers that the real question of art philosophy is; how is it possible to obtain pleasure for things that have nothing to do with the will (or desire)? Everyone knows that only when an object has a relationship with our will or desire, or when an object satisfies our purpose, can we have pleasure and enjoyment of this object. So to get pleasure from things that have nothing to do with the will seems contradictory. However, it is obvious that we actually get pleasure and enjoyment from beauty itself, and this is very unrelated to our personal purpose or our will.</p>
<p>Regarding the above contradiction, Schopenhauer proposed his solution. He believes that beauty is the fundamental and original form of animate and inanimate nature. In Plato's words, it is the Ideal (ldeas). To understand beauty and recognize Ideals, it cannot be recognized by ordinary feelings and ordinary functions, but can only be recognized by the subject of knowledge free from the bondage of will. In other words, it can only be recognized by pure intellect without purpose and without desire. Therefore, in the act of perception of beauty, the will has absolutely no place in consciousness. But only the will is the source of all our sorrow and pain. If the will disappears in consciousness, wouldn't the possibility of all pain also disappear? This is the reason why there can be a sense of pleasure accompanying the perception of beauty. If someone says that if the possibility of pain is removed, then the possibility of happiness is also removed, how can one obtain happiness? Schopenhauer's answer is that the nature of happiness is passive. Happiness is just another name for the absence of pain, and only pain is the active element in existence. Therefore, when the will disappears in consciousness, it not only removes pain, but also removes the possibility of pain. What remains is the state of enjoyment, the state of happiness.</p>
<p>The meaning of pure intellect is to free a person from the bondage of self. To obtain pure intellect, we must forget our own purpose and completely immerse ourselves in the contemplation of the object; so that everything we are aware of is only this one object. For example, when we appreciate a beautiful plum blossom, we forget ourselves, forget everything, and only this plum blossom is in consciousness. Such an ability is not something that most people can have, and it is usually not suitable for dealing with the demands of the world. However, the function of art is constituted by this kind of function.</p>
<p>The intelligence of ordinary people exists for the will, works for the will, and is driven by the will. This kind of intelligence is used to make the will aware of and aware of the things around it, to listen to the will, and to satisfy the will's requirements. Therefore, this kind of intelligence does not easily perceive beauty. But suppose that the will temporarily releases the intelligence, lets the intelligence be free, so that the intelligence does not have to do the work of the will, and does not have to do its daily work, then the intelligence after such release becomes pure intelligence. However, this intelligence after release, although free from the work of the will, is not an intelligence that does not work, does not act, and does not strive. This pure intelligence is still active and striving, which explains why artistic creation is so scarce. The intelligence of ordinary people is activated only by the whip of the will. Our thoughts, our efforts, our ability to see and hear, directly or indirectly, are all serving our personal goals, big and small. Our intelligence is activated by the drive of the will. If this drive is removed, our intelligence may also stop acting and stop working as a result. This is the case for most people. The artist is different. The artist's intelligence, although free from the drive of the will, still maintains its activity. After the artist's intelligence is freed from the restraint of the will, on the one hand, it can objectively observe the universe and faithfully reflect life, and on the other hand, it can use principles and methods to select the subject matter - and its expression. Such as the accuracy of the painter in painting and using colors, such as the poet's choice of appropriate words and rhythms, these are all activities of intelligence. Therefore, in the artist's function, the intelligence is pure, free, and active, does not serve the will, but has its own goals for activity. (To be continued)</p>
<p>Random Talks on Academic Learning (70) by Zhang Qiyun</p>
<p>National Character and Education</p>
<p>The traditional Chinese educational thought is the Confucian teaching of the Six Arts. The Six Arts are rites, music, archery, horsemanship, writing, and arithmetic, among which rites and music are the central concepts of the Six Arts. Confucius said, "What is meant by 'rites, rites'? Is it jade and silk? What is meant by 'music, music'? Is it bells and drums?" When Confucians discuss rites and music, they naturally consider the spirit to be far more important than the material. Music represents empathy between people, and rites represent the distinctions between individuals. Music is what human feelings cannot help but express, and rites are what ethics cannot easily change. The Book of Rites says, "Music is for the common, rites are for the different. The common brings intimacy, and the different brings respect." The Book of Zhou Rites says, "Use rites to teach moderation, and use music to teach harmony." (Volume 3, Di Guan Shang). Confucian thought emphasizes both inner peace, which is the place of sameness and intimacy, and outward order, which is the place of difference and respect. Mutual creation and mutual completion are indispensable. A complete personality and an ideal society must possess both the teachings of rites and music, conforming to emotion and conforming to reason, in order to be considered perfect.</p>
<p>In Confucian thought, within rites and music, special emphasis is placed on musical education, regarding it as the core of education. The Book of Zhou Rites calls the Great Director of Music "to manage the laws of Chengjun, to manage the academic administration of building the state, and to unite the disciples of the state." (Volume 6, Chun Guan Xia). Chengjun is the university, why is the law of the university in charge of the music official? Because Confucians use the word "benevolence" to encompass all virtues, and music and benevolence are one, able to move human relations from the bloodline. Confucius was known for his many skills in his time, and he put particularly diligent effort and interest into music, such as "hearing Shao in Qi, and not knowing the taste of meat for three months," so deep was his immersion. The language of music is poetry, so poetic education is connected to musical education. "Gentle and honest" is the body of poetry, which can also be said to be the body of music. "Inspiring, observing, grouping, and complaining" are the uses of poetry, which can also be said to be the uses of music. Confucian discussions of education mostly start with rites and music, with music being more fundamental than rites. Of the ancient books that speak of music, none are more detailed than the Book of Zhou Rites. The Han people considered the Great Director of Music chapter of the Great Zongbo of the Book of Zhou Rites to be a special book for musicians, and the world then regarded it as the Classic of Music. Since ancient music is lost, what is described in the Book of Zhou Rites can still be seen in its broad outline.</p>
<p>The Book of Zhou Rites has the saying "Building a country must prohibit lewd sounds, excessive sounds, ominous sounds, and slow sounds" (Volume 6, Chun Guan Xia), which is also very meaningful. Our ancient ancestors believed that the way of sound is connected to government, and that there is no better way to change customs than through music. If a country's musical rhythm is dominated by lewd sounds, or loses the rhythm of sorrow and joy, or is negligent and disrespectful, or the sound is a scene of destruction and killing of a country, then its politics will inevitably be affected. The influence of lewd sounds on people gradually deepens, starting with corrupting emotions, then destroying customs, and finally shaking and overturning the major principles and laws of a country. Pure music lies in promoting the virtue of moderation and harmony, regulating emotions and desires, and proceeding in a moderate way. It does not advocate prohibition or destruction, but also does not allow it to tend towards excessive indulgence. The ancients said, "Inspired by poetry, completed by music," the purpose of which is to cultivate a moderate national character, which was a very sound idea.</p>
<p>Archery and dance are also closely linked to rites and music. The function of music lies in being rich in both sound and appearance. It cannot be called music if there is sound without appearance. The musical dance of the Book of Zhou Rites uses dancers with harmonious colors and well-maintained bodies. Its records of ancient music include the past dynasties and the neighboring regions. All the major events and figures that can be commemorated in history have been included. The sound of drums and dancing is inspiring, so it has educational value. Archery is one of the Six Arts, and its purpose is also to advance virtue, not just a technique. The Archery of Rites says, "Therefore, archers must advance and retreat in accordance with the rites, their inner intentions must be correct, and their outer bodies must be straight. Then they hold the bow and arrow firmly and carefully. Only when the bow and arrow are securely tightened can they speak of hitting the target. From this, one can observe virtue." Archery was a major rite in ancient times. Confucius shot at the garden of Juexiang, and the viewers were like a wall. From this, it can be seen that ancient Chinese personality education and physical fitness were extremely important.</p>
<p>The fundamental concepts of Confucianism are correct and sound, but why is there a phenomenon of "the government exists with the person, and the government ceases with the person," resulting in fewer days of order and more days of chaos in history? According to Mr. Sun Zhongrong's view, it is necessary to remedy this in terms of vigorous practice. In the preface to The Essentials of Government in the Book of Zhou Rites, he said, "Do the Han Confucians not say, 'Governing does not lie in many words, but in how vigorously it is practiced'? If we truly reform the current laws, gather our strength and implement them without doubt, then these forty chapters will be more than enough to achieve prosperity and strength. If we cannot do this, then even if people have the strategies of Jia Yi and recite the books of Shema, what use will it be for the pain of ruin?" Therefore, Mr. Zhongrong proposed the view of supplementing the strengths and weaknesses of the two schools of Confucianism and Mohism. The revival of Mohism can be used as a view to supplement the strengths and weaknesses of Confucianism. He believed that the Book of Zhou Rites is the most complete of the classics, so he wrote The Correct Meaning of the Book of Zhou Rites. There is no greater virtue than Mo Di's actions, so he also wrote Leisurely Notes on Mozi. In the preface to Leisurely Notes on Mozi, he said that Mozi's establishment and response to the world have a foundation. His intentions were sincere and courageous in practice, laboring his body and mind to save the world from its ills. His strategies were sufficient to deal with danger and respond to change, and he did not burden his heart with profits and fame. His learning was especially comprehensive in art and science, thoroughly investigating the subtleties of phenomena and numbers (i.e., what is now called science). During the Warring States period, scholars referred to Confucius and Mozi together, and the prosperity of Mohism was almost equal to that of the Confucians. It is a pity that the theories of the Mohists often went to extremes (the theory of non-music is one example), making self-suffering the extreme, which was not easy to gain the sympathy of the world, and even more difficult to practice. This is a major reason why Mohism was interrupted for two thousand years after the Qin and Han dynasties. Mr. Zhongrong rose up in the late Qing dynasty at the time of survival and extinction, advocating the introduction of Mohism into Confucianism, which no Confucian scholar has dared to explicitly say in the past. He did his best to promote the spirit of "not warming the mat and not blackening the chimney," and was able to practice it himself, not just uttering empty words. From the twentieth year of Guangxu to the eleventh year of "★", he worked hard to establish schools in the two prefectures of Wenzhou and Chuzhou, and more than three hundred new schools were established, making his achievements the best in the country. Later, the Zhejiang Provincial Education Association publicly elected Mr. as the chairman, which was truly an honor for the people of Zhejiang. Mr. Zhongrong's original idea was to combine the "Ink" with "Centrality," taking moderate virtue as the foundation, and supplementing it with the spirit of vigorous practice and scientific methods. If this new style of learning can penetrate deeply into the people, I am convinced that it will have a significant contribution to the current nation-building enterprise.</p>
<p>Free Talk About Wine by Chen Yixian</p>
<p>In the March 6th issue of Free Talk, Mr. Yingzhi's article "Red Hair Burning and Shaoxing Yellow" said: "When it is cloudy and boring, gathering three or five old friends to drink in a small building and enjoy oneself to the fullest is also a great thing. However, the price of wine is rising every day, and I am afraid that the poor will not be able to afford it, so it is better to read other people's articles about wine." I am an old man and a drunkard, and I agree with this itching in the throat, so I will briefly describe the good wines I have eaten in my life to relieve the thirst.</p>
<p>In the third and fourth years of the Republic of China, when I was translating paintings in Shanghai, Zhu Guwei, who was sick with Shanshan Xuecheng, lived in Dongyouheng Road, and was known as the three old men of Hongkou. Chen Sanyuan lived in Tangyou Road and often drank with Yu Feiyuan. Feiyuan was the garden of Gan Hanshen, in Zhouyou Road. Every afternoon at four or five o'clock, my brother and I and Mr. Sanyuan, the three old men of Hongkou, often gathered in the garden. The host had a collection of various old brandies and whiskeys, and the guests drank as much as they wanted, without any restrictions, but no dishes were prepared. On the table, in addition to wine bottles and glasses, there was a large plate of Dinghao biscuits and a pot of top-quality Qimen black tea. One could drink tea or wine, as one pleased. The Western wine I have eaten in my life was the best here. Now a bottle of whiskey costs hundreds of millions of yuan, and there is no host like Mr. Gan.</p>
