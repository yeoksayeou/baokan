<h3>鄭大使覆貝文照會　我外交部公布全文　九龍城各次不幸事件港府應負責　促英接納我提解決辦法</h3>
<p>〔本報南京六日電〕外交部發言人六日宣布，關於九能城問題，我國答復英外部上月二十四日致我照會之覆文，已於五日由我駐英大使鄭天錫向英外相貝文正式促成，南京外交部並以副本一份於六日送致央駐華大使施諦文，兩日來由英交涉無何新發展。英使館六日亦無何表示。</p>
<p>〔本報南京六日電〕外交部六日午後公布我駐英大使鄭天錫博士木月五日關於九龍城事件答復英外相貝文先生照會全文，中文譯文如後：</p>
<p>逕啓者：接准貴部長一九四八年一月廿四日關於最近中國居民被迫遷出九龍城事之照會，誦悉一是，本大使茲奉中國政府之訓令，答復如下：</p>
<p>中國政府茲須聲明者，即關於九龍城之管轄權一事，中國政府一向堅持其對於一八九八年中，英展拓香港界址專條之解釋，認爲該專條已明白規定巾國保有其在九龍城之管轄權，此種解　不但可由該　條之文句中明悉，且有同年爲設立其他租借地所訂諸條約之規定，予以印證，　當時中國政府所採政策之原則，即爲在每一租借地內　定一特別區域，仍由中國保留其在該區域內之管轄權，而此種辦法之適用，不僅限於九龍城一地，該項政策之表現，舉例言之，一八九八年三月六日中國與德國關於膠州灣所訂取條第一條及一八九八年五月七日中國與俄國關於遼東半島所訂增立條款第四款由均有明文，該由俄增立條款第四款特別規定：「俄國國家允中國國家所請，允聽金州城自行治理，並城內設立應需巡捕人等。」？</p>
<p>査中英展拓香港界址專條有關條文中雖有「現在九龍城內駐剳之中國官員」一語，並規定此等中國官員行使管　權時，應不妨礙防衛香港之武備，但所謂中國官員顯非僅指常時在九龍城內担任官職之人員本身，而不包括其繼任人員。</p>
<p>且該專條雖訂有關於香港武備之條件，然並未規定須中國官員在任何情形之下撤退，反之，該專條又規定「其餘新租之地專歸英國管轄」，由此　規定之含　　之，在九龍城內英國自不能行使此種管轄權利。</p>
<p>關於貴部長來照所稱除日本佔領期問外，自一八九九年後，九龍城之管轄權即始終專由香港政府行使一節，本大使茲須向貴部長舉　若干事實，此等事實　部長當亦已知悉，第一，中國官員所以於一八九九年撤出九龍城及停止在該城內行使管轄權者，純囚其受武力之壓迫所致，當時並曾提出抗　，第二，自該時後，中國政府不但從未放棄其在該地區內所享之管轄權，且凡遇香港政府企圖佔取此項管轄稱時，均嚴厲反對，茲須特予引　者，即一九四六年時，中國政府　　訂方案，計劃在九龍城內恢復設治，此種計劃之暫予擱置，純係爲顯全中，英兩國之友好關係　想，猶憶香港總督當時曾發表聲明，否認由國政府在九龍城內恢復設治之權利，中國外交部發言人曾立則予以駁斥。</p>
<p>中國政府於去年十二月獲悉香港政府擬强迫中國居民遷出九龍城並拆除其住屋之後，即曾迭請英國駐華大使館警吿香港政府切勿採用强迫手段，常時中國政府即已深知此種手段可能引起嚴　之後果，然香港政府對於此種警吿　未置理，仍一意孤行，於本年一月五日及一月十二日，先後實行種種强制行動，此誠至　不　，一月十二日大隊武裝香港警察，配帶盾牌，鋼盔及武備，並偕同多數伕役，進人九龍城，竟於施放催淚彈之前，先即開槍射擊居民，因而若干居民常塲受傷，其中並有重傷者二人。</p>
<p>因此，中國政府堅決認爲九龍城各次不幸事件之責任顯然應由香港政府負責，該政府於由英雙方正在舉行商談，以求和平解決之際，悍然採取此種挑　行爲，此實此次事態惡化之主因，終至引起其後之若干事故，一月十六日之沙面事件即係其一，就中國政府之觀點言，若將儿龍城各次不幸事件之責任　諸報章記載或評論，誠　有失公平。</p>
<p>中國政府對於貴部長所持寳安縣長因前往九龍城勘察，故應對九龍城事件負相當責任之一點見解，亦難予以接受，該寳安縣長之前往該城勘察，並慰問一月五日被迫拆遷之居民，原係依法負有管理該城責任之縣長爲執行其　務所應從事之最低限度行爲。</p>
<p>除以上所述事實外，本大使尙擬提出另一觀點，希望貴部長予以等量之考慮，爲澈底了解一八九八年關於九龍租借地之條約，則必須憶及諸租借地設立之當時環境，常時中國政府因不能拒絕列强在亞洲大陸爭設勢力圈之要求，遂僅作一最低限度之保留，其方法即在各租借地內，劃定一特別區域，使地方政府仍繼續行使職權，換言之，中國爲環境所迫，僅同意遷就有關列强軍事上之需要，而不放棄各該地區之管轄　，今者九龍已成為一種過時制度之殘跡，因之，凡遇英國政府對於巾國政府關於九龍城之最低保留亦不尊重之時，不幸影響之發生常不難想見。</p>
<p>爲謀防止事態益趨惡化起見，中國政府茲敦促英國政府即行接納中國政府以前經由本大使館及英國駐華大使館轉達貴國政府之各項解決辦法。</p>

<p>〔本報潘陽六日電〕行轅電覆津金管局，對東北內匯工商款項，應由津負責合理管制，而此種匯款絕非游資來源，如限制內匯，影響關內外物資流通，刺激束北通貨膨脹，助長物價漲風，實屬不宜。</p>

<h3>企圖破壞中美友誼者是誰？</h3>
<p>讀駐滬美總領首次演說詞有感</p>
<p>美國駐滬總領事卡勃脫先生，蒞任未久，前天在扶輪社發表他來華後的初次演脫。演詞全文，已譯載於昨天的本報。這是一年以來我們所難得讀到的一篇暢論中美邦交的爽快文字！</p>
<p>美總領事在他的演詞裏，闡明美國對華政策，同時對中國方面所或許有的誤解，十分表示遺憾。第一，他說明美國並不忽視中國，扶植日本。第二，他說明美國援助他國決不是爲自私的目的。第三，他說明美國政策絕非由帝國主義的動機所鼓動的。這些，都是我們所樂聞而且深信的</p>
<p>美總領事在他演詞的後段，因爲中國人「對於另一個外國帝國主義却沒有多大的批評，而這個外國帝國主義實際上它佔領着中國一部分的領土，輕視中國政府，」甚至中國人對於雅爾達會議時對美國實施壓力而今日享用雅爾達協定這些讓步的那個强國，並沒有多大指摘，並且上海學生爲九龍事件遊行示威而牽涉到反美，深深地感到詫異。但是美總領事終於由他的慧眼，觀察到中美之間所以會有這樣的事情，乃是由於「在美國已發見一種小小的集圑，一羣不忠於國家的人民，瘋狂似的設法推翻我們的國家與制度。……這批外國專制主義的奴才，當然想要破壞中美兩國間古老的友誼。也許這個專制主義國家的一班寵臣在中國也很忙碌。」因而，他最後要求「凡是相信自由國家爲共同利益而合作的人，必須常常謹防這種誹謗的謠言，」美總領事　一番話，眞可謂一針見血，比較那些善用外交詞令來裝飾的爽辣得多了。</p>
<p>誠如大美晚報昨日社論所云，這篇演詞應當讀完，每一點都是值得仔細的　。我們讀完了以後，除了衷心戚佩而外，願先率直地一述我們的感想。</p>
<p>第一，中美之間悠久而深厚的友誼，自美國國務卿海約翰氏提倡門戶開放政策，遏止淸末列强瓜分中國的陰謀以後，就建築起來，迨美國首先退還庚子賠款，益見增進，由來至少有四五十年的演進歷史，而經此次世界大戰，兩國健兒駢肩作戰，中國尤承美國朝野精神的物質的技術的種種援助，只要是中國有良知的人民，沒有一個不知道中美友誼實在已經用了血汗凝結的比從前更鞏固了。中國人讀聖腎書，最重視忠恕之道，最壓惡負恩負義。美國對華毫無領土野心，而戰時戰後，始終援助，這種情誼，豈便淡忘？所以麥克阿瑟元帥儘管在日本表示種種寬恕日寇，以及美國工商鉅子儘管在鼓吹扶植日本恢復其紡織事業的海外市塲，我們還是相信美總領事的闢謠是眞實而誠摯的。不過，在中國有沒有鼓吹懷恨美國的言論呢？有的，那是中國共產黨和其尾巴的　論而已。他們在戰時尙且常常如此，何况戰後？他們往往企圖乘一二個美兵醉後肇事的機會，擴大宣傳，好像可以形成中美間的仇恨。這種無聊之舉，在中國人方面，有知識者原不値一顧，而却偏偏有若千美國記者，無意中受了他們的利用，予以重視，爲之宣傳，於是傳到美國，好像中國人有多數都在那裏「反美」了。例如：此次上海二三千學生爲九龍事件遊行，濫寫「反美」標語，美總領事深以爲異。其實想穿了，大可一笑，上海大學中學的學生不下十萬人，祗有如此少數遊行，而用柏油濫寫標語者，據目覩者謂祗有五六人而已。這何嘗能代表學生的意見，更何嘗能代表民意？須知這就是中共黨徒處心積慮破壞中美友誼的「傑作」，而其「傑作」亦不過爾爾！</p>
<p>第二，我們對於美總領事痛斥「這批外國專制主義的奴才」想破壞中美友誼，而以爲「這班寵臣在中國也很忙碌」這種看法，不但深具同感，而且要更進一步奉吿美總領事者，這批奴才寵臣，在中國的忙碌也許有甚於在美國者。美國的共　黨在美還不過　用「木馬政策」，鑽入各機關各社團裏去陰謀推翻美國的國家與制度，而中國共產黨則現已明目張膽，嗚鑼執杖的，正式搬演中國歷史上　寇的戲劇角色。他們豈但在中國境內很忙碌，且更忙於向「這個專制主義國家」去請示聽訓，忙於向我們友邦美國的共黨去聯絡實傳，以便彼此呼應，效忠於他們的共同「領袖」。可是，我們　得中共的眞面目爲什麼美國一部分人到現在還沒有弄明白，其原因多少由於前此年若干外國好奇的記者有意無意中受了共黨的蠱惑。譬如，在延安，明明一切都單調。絕無自由，而偏有外國記者誤信中共所建立的是自由的民主政府：他們不知道在共匪區內凡是意見和共黨不同的人都被稱爲「人民的敵人」，「叛徒」，「國特」，「法西斯」，不配享有自由的，這是多麼獨裁的一種政治！父如，中共明　是共產主義者，而若干外國記者至今還在隨口胡說中共祗是「土地改革派」，不是眞正的共產黨，甚至還替他們掩飾着說中共和那個「專制主義國家」沒有關係。諸如此類，不一而足。中美友誼本來毫無問題，而其所以似乎蒙上一層陰影者，大半就是由於這些對中國政府製造惡意誹謗，而對中共則力爲粉飾誇張的陰謀家，透過了若干外國記者，利用他們的筆，對中美友誼無形中加了暗箭</p>
<p>第三，我們要率直指出，企圖破壞中美友誼者是中國共產然，但力國挽回從而加強中美友誼，以期能共同「抵住一種空前的暴政」者，無疑的應該是中美兩國的大政治家與有遠大眼光的外教官。須知今天局而業已顯明，這一個「專制主義國家」，想利用中國和南洋的共產黨來　除美英法等國有亞洲的力量。不但如此，它現在已利用了雅爾達協定所得到的讓步，從而「佔領着中國一部分的土地」，以爲將來從中國的東北進窺美國的阿拉斯加，先築一踏石。毛澤東早在戰時「論新民主主義」的小冊子中說過：「中國的革命是世界無產階級革命的一部分，它需要蘇聯的幫助」。他又說：「任何中國人和美國合作的就是反動份子，中國惟一的國際友人是蘇聯。反蘇和反共就是漢奸」。共匪始終在毛賊的指示之下，執行他們背叛政府，反對美國的策略。所可惜的，美國當局在某一時期不十分看淸楚這一點，硬　國民政府容納中共，參加聯合政府，而結果自然只有失敗：可是到現在，還似乎爲了這一個嘗試的失敗不免耿耿於心，好像國民政府不够朋友，因是而援華貸款始終還在若卽若離的狀態。我們要提醒一句：若果只讓一部分職業的外交家如從前范宣德氏之流，挾了成見，祗知從小眼裏挑剔，不從大處落墨，趕快施行美國遠大的援華政策，我們深恐世局日急，時不我待的了。至於美國人如果懷疑中國人爲什麽對這「另一個外國帝國主義」沒有多大批評和　摘，那更不是眞相。只要　閱有七十五年最久歷史的本報社論，和一般人民團體對於東北被人强佔的抗議與示威，就可知中國眞正民意之所在。在此，要請美國友人切莫以爲只有標榜中問路錢，自號民主自由的報紙才是中國的輿論！我們甚盼中　兩國當局共同認淸共產黨在整個世界的行動目的，一致對付，則有了共信，自會互信，中美悠久的友誼又豈少數共黨匪徒所能破壞的呢？</p>

<h3>統一德西部經濟行政　新憲法章週一實施　改組經濟委會權利擴大　輔以立法司法機構受佔領當局節制</h3>
<p>〔路透社柏林六日電〕德境英美軍政府長官昨在柏林簽署之英美區經濟行政新憲章，業於今日發表。全文長二千字，共分十三條，規定於二月九日星期一起施行改組後之英美合併區經濟行政機構，包含一具有委員一百零四人較現有經濟委員會委員數增加一倍之經濟委會，一由合併區內每邦各派代表二人合組之議會，一行政委員會及若干其他機構，包括一人事局，一統計局，及一立法咨戰局。重要的行政委員會亦即法國及德各邦總理對英美所擬原案批評最甚之點，列於憲章第六條內。行政委會設主席一人，由經濟委會推選，須經議會及英美管制當局之同意。行政委會主席非經經濟委會對其通過不信任票，並經議會及英美管制當局批准後不得罷免。行政委會所屬之部長，非經經濟委會對其通過不信任票並經英美管制當局批准後，不得罷免。改組後的經濟委會由現有經濟委會全體委員五十二名，加各邦議會所選新委員五十二人，共一百另四人合組而成。委員按政治意見代表人數比例分配，每邦至少應推選一人。經濟委會之職權包括通過並公布施行關於鐵道港口。海　航運。內河運輸。邦際水道專利權，稅卡等行政管理，賦稅及合併區文職官吏之管理等之法令；此外對於有關邦際公路，原料糧食之生產分配收集積儲。煤氣。自來水電力。對外對內貿易。物價管制及八費貼補之事務而影響一邦以上者，亦得行使類似的職權。關於勞工之要求，經濟委會亦有決定優先次序之權。經濟委會並得通過合併區每年之預算，以關稅　費運輸稅及合併區管制下公營企業之盈利爲其收入，其他之收入包括薪給所得稅·公司稅之一部。及以稅收爲抵押借貸而得之款。合併區並將設立法院，由經濟委會經英美管制當局特准後，決定其管轄權。此等法院之上，即爲軍政府所設之合併區高等法院，經濟委會並得爲此等法院設立檢察署。經濟委會開會時，得令行政委會任何委員列席備詢，經濟委會經英美管制常局特許後，並得設立監督機構，以監督法令之執行。邦議會由每邦各派代表二人組成，其中一人得由邦總理兼任，其任期與邦政府同。其職權包括：　擬具經委會職權內之立法，惟關於稅收及撥款者不在此限；　以比較多數通過修正成否決未經先行批准之經濟委會所通過的立法案；　批准行政委會主席之任命；　令行政委員會主席或仟何委員列席備詢。行政委會主席有權指導並聯絡所屬各部長兼委員之行使其職權。行政委會之主席或委員，得向經濟委會或議會建議立法案，及頒佈旅行規則。經濟委會及議會所頒命令，有慶止前此德國法會之效用，但其所頒命令須經英美管制管局批准。憲章並規定經濟委會及議會應於　章施行後十五天內成立並行使職權。</p>

<h3>英法擬向荷比盧提五國同盟草案　此舉爲趨向泛歐主義道路起點</h3>
<p>〔路透社倫敦五日電〕可靠方面息：英國所起草將由英法聯合向荷比盧建議共組五國同盟之建議草案，於上週末經送交法政府研究後，法政府已向英國提出滿意的答覆，其中對英國之原案，並無重大修正。下一步　將爲由英法共同向荷比盧政府提出五國同盟草案以供研究。最近荷比盧三國外長在盧森堡　會後發表之共同宣言，表示接受與英法加緊圑結之原則，惟　明在提出任何肯定的答覆以前，當先等待接獲其正式的建議。此同觀察家相信，荷比盧之接受火法之共同建議，當有　於五國聯盟之是否得在關於德國未來經濟之決策中，得有有效的發言權而定。此一點是否得在五國聯盟草約中特別規定，須俟英法美三國於二月十九日在倫敦討論西德之未來時，始有決定之機會。</p>
<p>〔路透社白魯塞爾五日電〕英國務大臣麥克尼爾今日在比京與比總理史巴克，非正式討論貝文外相之西歐聯盟建議。</p>
<p>〔路透社白魯賽爾五日電〕英國務大臣麥克尼爾談稱：「吾人若欲建立西歐聯盟，匪特應有即時性的犧牲，且需要重大的政治決議。歐洲似已採取新的決定，不僅表示決不再接受獨裁制度，並表示業已採取即時性的步驟，協力防止緊急狀態的發生，或任何獨裁極權制度之進展。此項決意並不與聯合國憲章衝突，亦未必與歐洲國家所參加之非歐洲任務相衝突。此項決議不具進攻之意，僅在從事守衛。歐洲團結之原則業已提出，惟於適用之際，在技術上必甚複雜，在政治上亦多牽制，不僅需要各參加者之從事即時性的經濟犧牲，且將使政治家大耗心血，或許此舉即爲趨向汎歐主義道路的起點。在汎歐主義下，歐洲必將較前此更爲偉大。麥氏並透露，英政府已主張邀請荷比盧三國出席二月十九日在倫敦舉行之英美法三强會議，俾提出對於西德未來之意見。</p>
<h3>北歐三國家　謀組中立集團</h3>
<p>〔路透社斯德哥爾摩五日電〕瑞典挪咸丹麥三國總理定週一在此開會，討論斯坎的那維亞國間之更密切合作，屆時討論主題之一，將爲由斯坎的那維亞國家合組西方強國與蘇聯間「中立集團」之可能性。瑞典外長恩登巳吿知國會，以瑞典不擬參加貝文外相所建議的西歐聯盟計劃。據悉在恩登向國會發表此意以前，瑞挪丹三國外長業已議定三國之不參加西歐聯盟，僅事促進三國相互間更緊密的合作。觀察家預料此一「中立集團」，僅爲一種精神上的同盟，並非正式的同盟公約。三國深恐締結正式同盟公約，將引起蘇聯之反感，故不願使三國之團結產生極正式的形式。迄至目前爲止，斯坎的那維亞國間欲謀建立更緊密合作之一切企圖，甚至若關稅同盟亦均引起蘇聯報紙之嚴重譴責，指彼等意在合組敵視蘇聯之集圑。</p>

<h3>赫爾回憶錄十三　北美報業聯合會版權所有　本報編譯室　不發一顆子彈得到了一切</h3>
<p>一九三八年八月，當捷克斯洛伐克的危機再度成爲緊急之時，驚人的消息不斷地湧到我的辦公桌上來。急切的和平談判主要在英國和德國之間進行。我於一九三七年曾在華盛頓看見過的偷雪曼〔Waler　Runciman〕已由英方派到普拉格去，在捷克人與蘇台德納粹份子之間進行調停。同時希特勒似乎正在準備侵入捷克斯洛伐克。</p>
<p>在九月十五日英首相張伯倫離英赴德和希特勒親自舉行第一次談話之前一刻，英國外交部向肯奈蒂大使建議，說他們喜歡總統能就一發展表示意見。就在那一天的記者招待會上，我說：「英國首相和德國總理今日舉行的歷史性會議，凡是深切關心維護和平的國家，當然是以最大的興趣加以注意的。」</p>
<p>當電報源源不斷地從歐洲流入國務院，緊張情形愈來愈甚的時候，我屢次到白宮去訪問總統。我同時還時常派副國務卿韋爾斯和助理國務卿貝爾帶情報和批評到白宮去。蒲立特和肯奈蒂大使幾乎每天和我通電話。</p>
<p>張伯倫於九月二十二日再到德國去見希特勒。由於英法政府正以堅強壓力加諸捷克政府，迫使它對希特勒讓步一點已經成爲很明顯，美國報紙中的批評愈來愈多，認爲捷克斯洛伐克正被出賣給希特勒了。</p>
<p>九月二十四日，肯奈蒂從倫敦打電話給我，說明英國內閣顯已發生分裂。他說張伯倫相信「必須以任何代價覓致和平」，而若干其他閣員則說他不願意「再和希特勒私下商談了」，並且相信他們「總是要戰的。」他說，曾爲戈林的空軍迭成深刻印象的林白上校，已被英國人請去商談。林白已經向我們報吿過，說他相信德國極容易應付其他　切歐洲國家的聯合空軍力量。</p>
<p>就在那一天，蒲立特從巴黎打電報給我，他認爲我們應爲維護和平而作若干努力，縱使不成功，也應該有所表示。他建議由總統向英，法，義，德，波各國首長提出呼　，請他們派代表到海牙來解決危機，並且我們應該表示願意派代表出席。</p>
<p>翌日，二十五日，我們駐普拉格的公使卡爾〔我進國務院的時候，他是在擔任助理國務卿〕用電報打來貝奈斯總統的一個呼　，希望總統敦促英法不要丟棄捷克斯洛伐克，讓它毁滅，致使一個不但牽涉捷克斯洛伐克並且牽涉世界的大衝突，更其接近。</p>
<p>總統和我一直在討論究竟應該採取什麼行動。總統準備向歐洲各有關政府的首相提出他個人的呼籲。我的思想則是：我雖不反對提出這些呼　，但是不相信結果可以證明其有意義。我對總統說，我覺得我們接到的證據是如此衆多，充份證明德國已武裝到極端的程度，決意不顧一切進行廣泛的侵略，除了對方具有充份的兵力或者完全投降之外，決不能阻止希特勒去追求他的計劃。這意思就是任何步驟，凡是沒有適當的兵力去對付希特勒的，一定是屬於綏靖性質和純粹是臨時性的。</p>
<p>我深恐總統採取過份熱烈步驟的結果，會使我們落入和張伯倫落入同一的綏靖營陣，而遲早會引起和張伯倫一樣的名沒不彰。我想這種步驟，可能使和平國家誤信我們以爲沒有其他可能的辦法了。更有進者，縱使這種努力獲得成功，也是危險的，因爲那時候這些國家可能以爲戰爭的危險已成過去，並以爲應付無可避免的德國威脅所必需的大規模軍事準備，已無迫切的需要。爲的見解是：以希特勒的計劃和決心言之，局勢眞是千鈞一髮。另外一種危險是，愈是向希特勒提出狂熱的呼　，愈足以增强他已經是驕傲得了不得的自我，致使他以爲沒有一個人是敢反對他的，他是全能的，他是可以一步步獲得他需要的一切的。此外，我對希特勒的任何保證毫無信心可言，割一大塊重要的土地給希特勒而從他獲得一種保證的思想，在我看來似乎是自欺欺人。韋爾斯不斷促使總統向前跑，我却不斷勸他慢行。</p>
<p>但是總統相信蒲立特的說法，就是縱使不成功，也應該做一些事。他對我說，「這是沒有妨礙的。不妨敦促和平到最後一分鐘。」</p>
<p>總統既已決定提出他的呼籲，我們就努力選擇一個最有效的時刻發表它們。有好幾天的時間，我們在準備稿子，一次又一次。韋爾斯和貝爾担任大部份的起草工作，總統自己也相當參與其事。</p>
<p>九月二十五夜，我們對總統的文吿作最後的修飾。我們竭盡力之所能，在文字所許可的範圍之內，使文告儘量有力。甚至在最後的稿子議定之後，總統還用鉛筆稍爲改了幾下。於是在九月二十六日早晨一點鐘，總統用同樣的文吿直接送給希特勒和貝奈斯，並且經由我送給張伯倫和達拉第。我們並把它送給我們駐華沙和布達佩斯的外交代表團，並且訓令它們把它轉呈波蘭和匈牙利外交部。波蘭和匈牙利爲了要求擴克斯洛伐克的某數部份，使危機更深刻了一層。</p>
<p>總統說，「代表美國一億三千萬民衆，爲了世界各地的人類，我最懇切地向你們呼籲，不要使談判破裂，而去　求對當前問題和平的，公正的，建設性的解決。</p>
<p>「我　切地再說一　，就是祗要談判繼續，　見總可能和解的。一且談判破裂了，理智即吿喪失，暴力就此抬頭。」　於是我們就　息等待答　。其中有三個答覆我們沒有等待得很久。在同一犬，九月二十六日，貝奈斯，達拉第和張伯倫對於總統的見解表示完全同意，並且願意談判和平。這幾個答覆立即加以宣佈，因此可以在希特勒預定於那天晚上發表的演說之前，公吿大衆。但是希特勒的答覆並沒有來，而這個答覆，却是我們最懇切期待的。</p>
<p>歐洲正在動員。肯奈蒂從倫敦用電話吿訴我說，英國政府已保證法國，就是戰爭倘使發生，英國決予支持。同時，張伯倫已通知希特勒說，他的要求——張伯倫看見他一次便提高一次——是不能接受的，但是要求繼續談判。我問肯奈蒂英國人是否相信法國人頗有作戰準備。肯奈蒂不能給我一個正面的答覆，但是他說英國人，猶如他們一向表現的，覺得他們能够及時而起」，他們正在命令他們的艦隊隨時警戒，並且已經召集各領地的軍隊入伍。</p>
<p>蒲立特用電報吿訴我說，達拉第說他希望召集會議以組織歐洲眞正和平的時機，不久能够到臨；他以爲召集這個會議應由總統出面。</p>
<p>現在，張伯倫相想在下一個晚上，九月二十七日，向美國人民發表廣播演說，但是總統說不。他以爲由英首相向美國人民直接演說可能引起誤會。</p>
<p>希特勒　答　是在九月二十六日晚上到的。這是對捷克政府，凡爾賽條約和國際聯盟的一篇冗長責難，最後把和戰的責任放在捷克斯洛伐克身上，不放在德國身上。</p>
<p>現在我們必須決定次一步驟應該採取什麽。蒲立特打電報來建議，主張由總統再發第二個電報給希特勒，請他同意派代表一人到海牙參加會議，猶如蒲立特先前建議過的。他說達拉第對這個意見表示「欣喜」。</p>
<p>許多其他國家已經來電支持總統上一天的呼籲。九月二十七日下午，我們把訓令發給我國駐於別國政府的代表，請這幾國政府向德國和捷克斯洛伐克發出類似的呼籲。十九國政府，其中十七個是拉丁美洲的，對此項建議表示贊同。</p>
<p>我並且發一個電報給駐　馬的費里普大使，其巾附有總統個人致墨索里尼的一個機密文吿，要求　索里尼「協助繼續以談判或其他和平方式，就當前問題努力獲致協議，而不訴諸武力。」</p>
<p>羅斯福總統決定再發一個呼籲，這一次是單給希特勒的。此項呼籲，係由　爾斯起草，於九月二十七日晚上發出，其中建議對捷克爭　直接有關各國在歐洲某中立地點立即舉行會議，並稱「繼續談判依然是在任何永久基礎上解決當前問題的唯一辦法。」</p>
<p>當我們正在緊張中等待希特勒的答覆之時，英大使林特賽在送給我們一份張伯倫最近到希特勒和墨索里尼的電文之後，復徇我之請，前來看我。我對大使說：「我請你來，是要吿訴你，假如目前威脅性已經很大的戰爭眞正發生了，我希望你的政府知道一點，就是我國政府決無什麼政策或目的想來代替英國在世界各部份的現有貿易。不論我們對於獲致其他許多國家的貿易方而做些什麼，我們決無意於利用戰爭對英國貿易所造成的不利情形以及英國的參戰而奪取其貿易」。大使似乎頗爲感動。</p>
<p>於是，在九月二十八日下午，當世界局勢正在進退維谷之際，希特勒邀請張伯倫，達拉第和舉索里尼於次日和他在慕尼黑會晤，以謀解決捷克危機。戰爭至少是暫時延緩了。</p>
<p>至於是否總統採取的行動造成這種結果，却不能說。它們曾發生相當大的影響，則毫無疑義。十月二十日，英大使林特賽帶給我一封英王喬治五世致總統的信件，答覆總統邀請英王英后於一九三九年訪問加拿大之時來美訪問，英王寫說，「我覺得我必須說，我對於你干預最近的危機是何等歡迎。我毫不懷疑它們對於維獲和平大有貢獻。」</p>
<p>但是對於我，慕尼黑協定似乎祗是一種暫時的解決。保持和平有兩種方法，或者是以實力對付希特勒，或者是投降，現在採取的是後者。希特勒所以沒有發動戰爭，乃是因爲他不發一槍一彈得到了他所需要的一切。現在，捷克斯洛伐克在他面前是毫無防衛的了。他可以等待時機，並且隨手可得，彷彿在籠中的桿上捉一只鳥一樣。英國和法國在他面前退縮了。張伯倫首相的忠於和平以及爲謀和平而作的極大努力和個人犧牲，雖然錯誤，但也有若干英勇性質在內，可是對於希特勒，這却是軟弱的表現。所以我相信從這種步驟，祗能產生「暫時的和平」猶如我在一個月前向法國大使所說的。張伯倫稱呼它「我們這個時代的和平」，但是這個時代是短的。</p>

<h3>俄婦暴卒屍體不僵　三醫師審驗斷定·醫學上有此可能</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕最近本市白俄僑民中盛傳一女屍不僵之謎。緣有格萊托尼可佛夫人者〔見圖〕，年已四十，數年前與其夫因意見不合離異，乃挈其現方九齡之女孩居於格羅希路四十七號，並役於霞飛路某酒吧間爲侍女，因身世凄凉，工作勞苦，故常　　寡歡。本月二日淸晨，自酒吧間返家後，不知受何刺激，</p>
<p>突罹急症，至十時許即氣絕畢命，其屍身於當晚裝於棺本移移置亭利路白俄敎堂，蓋依白俄習俗，人死後須在敎堂巾放置三日，俾完成宗敎儀式。是晚，醫師柴可倫應召至敎堂簽發死亡證書，但於檢視屍身時，發現女之</p>
<p>肚腹上溫，手足仍可彎曲，乃大爲駭異，迨再細加檢視，則又確已死亡。當時柴可倫以事出離奇，未肯遽行簽發證書，而於次日再往檢視，則已全身冰冷僵硬矣。然是日白俄社會中已盛傳女實未死之謠，「俄文日報」且爲文刋載，事聞於俄僑總會會長波洛哥夫，爲明瞭究竟，乃囑其秘警另派醫師奧其微等三人</p>
<p>同往審察。三醫師於詳細察視之下，證明確已身故，其死因爲心臟衰弱突受刺激所致，至其死後短期內肚腹不冷，手足不僵之規象，在醫學上亦屬可能，尙不足視爲怪異，該婦屍身乃於前日安葬於虹橋公墓。</p>

<h3>玉堂春（五十）</h3>
<p>蘇三被景隆緊緊鈎着，心内有什麽不明白，微歎了一声道：“我心裏，如亂麻一樣，你也早些將息將息罷。”景隆道：“不見你時，倒也罷了，見了你，教我那裏放得下。”蘇三想把右手去攀脫他的左手，却如生在肩上一般，聽景隆這樣說，不禁竪眉微嗔道：“照你說還是我來得不好了。”景隆道：“正為你無處不好，使我越發放你不下了，好妹妹，還是依了我這一遭罷。”蘇三禁不起景隆廝纏，到底還是依了他一回兒，古語說：千金一刻，這時的一刻時光，所值眞也不止千金咧！無奈好夢乍圓，闕歌已促，分別時，眞有說不盡的千金萬語，景隆送下樓來，還未到客寓門房，早見小金哥倚着門兒，是他們出來，便迎着進來，蘇三臉兒一紅，把手拍着他的肩兒道：“小金哥，明兒公子動身，還是要你照顧了，你這樣為我兩人盡力，我也沒有報答你的地方，還是認了你做弟弟罷。”小金哥苦笑道：“我這樣一個苦瓜兒，那裏有福氣，有你這個好姊姊，三姑娘，你放心回去罷，明兒送了公子動身，我自會來通知你的。說着已走至門首，那車子還停着等候，車夫却在車子中打磕睡，小金哥喚醒了車夫，蘇三道：“你們進去罷，今晚上早些睡，明天還須趕路咧。”坐上車子，在珠箔內揮揮手，車夫在後而推動車子，一時輪聲轆轆，便漸漸隱沒在黑暗當中。景隆和小金哥，送走了蘇三，回到樓上房間中，不免準備了一回，上次景隆除了銀兩，可稱身無一物，此次蘇三却替他撿了幾件襯衫褲兒，以便途中替換，又有幾兩零散銀子，也放在包內。</p>

<h3>銀色的西子</h3>
<p>〔本報杭州六日訊〕西伯利亞的寒流，襲擊到演海的東南區域，把溫柔美麗的西子湖，也變得凋零冷酷。天，無可奈何的下了一朝霧，薄薄地罩住這光山禿樹，淚成了冰，西湖的湖面上也幾乎可以溜冰了，因此，這層薄霉滯留着不肯蹄去。　農毅立春的前一天，又下了一塲大雪，這才把遠近的景物，厚厚地涂上了銀色。西子湖只落得淸麗挺秀，益發博得窈窕了。湖演公園，</p>
<p>冒著風雪</p>
<p>欣賞這美的景色的人區多著哪，穿着雨衣，有的慢慢地區着，有的跳着跑着，女孩子們長長的卷髪上都停留着萱萱的雪花，男孩子們帶着照相機來攝取各個不同的鏡頭。在斷戲到白堤一帶，許多男女學生在散步着，他們並着肩，輕輕地在私語。孤山的辣梅迎雪怒放，因着有不斷去欣賞的人，所以使孤山反顧得熱鬧。更有一些雅士們，到中山公園，或是西泠印社的四照閣，泡一盃香茗，領略這銀裝的面子。　關心的人，在談論這一朝雪下得真好：「下學立春前，一定是豐年。」今年的</p>
<p>秋收保障　已經顧示了端倪，心情上自然十分愉快，因此，閃燈取　，吟詩飮酒的也大有人在。　——這是什麽？這比天堂，有什麽不同的區別？然而，國內的戰亂，最近上海的連續暴動，使這靜靜地平和的天堂，每個人的心頭也感着緊張煩苦。並且，因着各方面的影響，嚴重物價的高壓下，也有很多人貧窮無吿，過着街頭流浪的生活。　在這裏，也會有</p>
<p>冬令救濟　的發起，政府撥了五千萬元，另外舉行電影，話劇，書畫展覺等義賣，據說電影，話劇謙不到錢，書費展醫稱爲有一點盈餘。冬令救濟有三樁大事業，一爲庇寒所與施粥所，一爲小本貸款，一爲舊衣的施捨。施粥所有五個，最近還要增設一個，米是田民食調節會撥給的，粥菜是由醫菜業同業公曾捐的，主持的人由地方上的慈善人士担任的，據說每天大約有六千個人吃，原本想由各保</p>
<p>查報赤貧　的人，特蹬再來吃的，後來覺得去吃施粥的人，反正都是赤貧的，所以也不必辦設件，隱便什麽人，抵要是貧窮的都可以去一吃。薜寒所爲利用行總的　帳，臨時蓋搭的，至於誰有資格可以住庇寒所，也沒有統計與調査，而且庇寒所蓋在空地上，僅是一廉布蓬，又沒右稻草與棉絮之類，誰願意來挨凍受冷，所以布蓬也沒有張掛起來，惟置在施粥所裏。</p>
<p>小本貸款　是用市銀行做担保向省銀行借一億元作爲貸款的資金，每戶可貸得五十萬元，由各區調査有能力經發攤販而無資本的人，再由市府派員實地調査，然後貸給他們，至於歸還與否？則爲另一問題，現在已經貸了二十多戶。施送寒衣一項，計六完成的棉衣一千件，另外破襪，膠鞋，舊衣等，約爲二千件，現在已將棉衣一千件分發了，分發　對象也是根據各保所調査回。像這樣的冬令救濟，比起上海來，自然顯得冷淡得多了。而且有些久合救濟事業，旣缺乏詳細的調査，也沒有追求救濟後的效果，不免使人感覺太「不問收穫」了。　由於冬令救濟的「不問收穫」，所以在這大風雪由，正很很多人，</p>
<p>啼飢號寒</p>
<p>抄不到稱宿。正有許多人愁眉苦臉，不知道如何應付這難關？他們一樣的躑躅衡頭，但並非「賞心樂事」，而景爲了最低限度生存而掙扎。在大風雪的時候，米又秉　想了理由漲了價，各家商店貨物的價格，也想再度抬起頭來，但是其他的東西總不及米糧來得急要，稠布店與南貨店裏，應該熱鬧的時候到了，却反而門庭鑒落，皮鞋店，吃食店也變得凄凉。即是賣鷄子與猪肉的店舖，因着</p>
<p>殺年豬　價格過高，使一般雇主情顧不遠千里去鄉間採購，所以也異常淸冷。只有炎店倌，喜氣洋洋，不怕你不來買他的貨物。這對於貧窮的人是一個嚴重的威脅，在道個年頭，做好事的人也少了。賜捨米票，年糕票，已如鳳毛麟角，於是這些赤貧的人口，只有相對飮泣了。　在這個時候，風雪之中的名勝區，被人鑒稱爲「天堂」的杭州，住在這杭州的人們，真是有福嗎？不，一半，也可以帶是一大半的人在掙扎奮鬥，爲了他們自己的生存！〔本報特派員儲裕生〕</p>

<h3>北平藝術館成立　新平劇運動　積極展開　準備今春赴滬演出</h3>
<p>〔本報北平三日訊〕舊劇發源於北平，一直到現在，北平〔實際不只在北平〕天多數的劇院裹所演的還是舊劇，但近幾年來，舊劇顯見沒落了，一部分是電影話劇拉去了它的主顧，但主要原因却是舊劇本身所暴露的缺陷和伶人本身組織的不良。人們欣賞舊劇的要求在進步，舊劇已到了必須革新的時期。北平藝術館的成立，其中一項目的，便在改革舊劇，這一新平劇運動現正在發展中。　北平藝術館成立於本年元旦日，主其事者是前在北平主持戲劇學校的焦菊隱，參加工作的有名戲劇家劉念渠，査强麟等人。他們的工作範團不止於平劇，話劇〔已開始做〕電影，音樂，舞蹈，〔尙未開始〕都是要做的。這裏只想介紹一下新平劇。平劇團由館長焦菊險親自領導。</p>
<p>兩股逆流　　藝術館平劇團的基本演員，多是昔日戲劇學校的學生，有王金璐〔武生〕，傳德威〔凈〕，高玉倩〔旦〕，李金鴻〔武旦〕，沈金渡〔生〕，殷金振〔武丑〕，李一車〔廿〕。原來人位還多，但有的受不了國劇公會一部分人的壓迫，剩下的是這幾人。</p>
<p>一星期以前，藝術館舉行了一次新平劇座談會，為加的人，包括了戲劇理論家與演員，由新民報「天橋」版的編者馬彥祥主席。記者在這會，聽他們說新平劇運動遭遇着二股逆流。一股是國劇公會的少數人，他們認爲新平劇是「拙殘國劇」。對參加新平劇的演員說：「你們如果　加藝術館的新平劇，以後各班永遠不再用你們」。但這些受够了「角見」的氣的二三牌伶人，在這新組織裏，已感到自由，大多數未爲所動，並且向社會上說出了過去的痛苦，對一般伶人有了不小的影響。另一股逆流，是所謂舊劇「改革」家，這些人所做的只是改改唱詞，編編新腔，捧捧角兒，名爲「改革」，實爲復古，齊如山便是被指爲此一逆流中的人，和馬彥祥，焦菊隱等人，已打過熱鬧的筆戰。</p>
<p>革新途備　根據「戲劇是表演現實」的理論，焦菊隱他們遵循着以下的路子從事於新平劇運動　革新伶人的淫難生活，造成爲藝術而工作的演員。　革新後台組織，舊劇的人事制度和組織行政完全是爲了錢，重腦門兒，爭牌位。必須打倒與「角兒」狼狽爲奸的經勵科。</p>
<p>給爲國家社會人民服務的立塲選擇劇本。</p>
<p>建立導演制度，導演必須是懂得戲劇理論並能運用戲劇理論者。</p>
<p>不斷墨習。</p>
<p>三次演出　藝術館平劇國的打泡戲，是新排得「桃花扇」，已經演出二次，共三十於塲，賣座始終不衰，收入有贏餘，壓倒了同時上演的舊劍「挑花扇」，論者咸認為是成功的，為舊劇革新奠下了基礎。第二次上演，採凡分幕制，取消了過塲與臉譜，採用燈光，佈景，皆甚精進。演員因此也年發揮了創造天才。如飾香　的高的倩，三次被打中，演出的是三種不同的表情，軍來是真麗自開嫁出仰，演出中途也根據話劇「桃花扇」改成了楊龍友逼迫貞麗出嫁，其他修改之處尚多，總之，一切都逼真，合理，不至因舊勢力的威脅利誘而倒合，其成功是可預期的。〔記者宋紹柏〕</p>

<h3>埠際足球大賽　港隊陣容決定　埠際人選未如理想　華聯陣甚爲堅强</h3>
<p>〔本報香港航訊〕港足球總會三日晚由埠際比賽小組委員會，選出港滬埠際足球港隊代表，原定港滬對抗三塲，第一塲滬港埠際，第二塲滬隊對港華聯，第三塲滬隊對港西聯。港方點將如下：</p>
<p>港埠際隊　　譚均幹（東方）　吿山奴（約瑟）　侯榕生（星島）　張金海（星島）　花留（香港）　劉松生（星島）　朱永强（星島）　基亞能（燕兵）　鄧宜杰（巴士）　鄒文治（巴士）　何應芬（星島）　　（領隊）麥亞路派吾，（隊長）吿山奴，（副選歷奇（香港），謝錦洪（東方），宋靈聖（星島），黎兆榮（星島），陳德輝（南華），李碩友（巴士）。</p>
<p>華聯隊</p>
<p>譚均幹（東方）　　錦洪（東方）　侯榕生（星島）　馮坤勝（巴士）　宋靈聖（星島）　劉松生（星島）　李碩友（巴士）　陳德輝（南華）　馮錦祥（星島）　謝錦河（星島）</p>
<p>（領隊）雷瑞熊，（隊長）馮景祥，（副選）曾啓榮（警察），曾仲　（傑志），張金海（星島），鄒文治（巴士），何應芬（星島），鄧宜杰（巴士）。</p>
<p>檢討港隊的實力，港埠際隊排出未如理想，花留的當選正中衛是冷門，前鋒的編排，尤欠完整，外將基亞能與華將合拍頗成問題，鄒文治也非右內鋒理想人物，鄧宜述僅得「快衝」兩字，屆時如果孟義良能把他看牢，前鋒進攻，大有問題。由於港方排陣的不適當，港滬埠際賽，變了勢均力敵。</p>
<p>第二占的華聯陣勢，除兩　外，餘都是理想人物，滬隊可能敵不過這一隊。第三戰，港西聯實力平凡，滬隊應在這裏取得勝利。</p>

<h3>實施代紡補充辦法　紗管會已呈請經濟部核定</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕紗管會擬定之代紡棉紗實施細則，六區公會曾經數度提供意見，請求重予考慮，當經該會召集六區公會負責人到會研討，茲據六區公會擬訂「實施代紡棉紗補充辦法」呈會核定。聞該會已備文　請經濟部核示，茲探得所擬補充辦法附錄如左：</p>
<p>代紡棉紗實施細則，業經本會規定，茲因各廠對於一自備存棉代紡棉紗用棉數量，及代紡工繳之計算等，提出請求。爲示體恤起見，特規定補充辦法如左：</p>
<p>賊至代紡實施前一日止，各廠自備存棉，作爲配棉脫節時週轉之用。如因脫節而動用時，其紡成之紗，由本會依照規定數量，隨時換給棉花，並給予工繳。倘本會無現棉可換時，此項棉紗得經本會核准，運往產棉區換購原棉，以資補充。</p>
<p>行總配棉，各廠應得工繳部份之棉花，作爲各廠自備存棉論。</p>
<p>各廠輸出棉紗布掉換外棉，在外銷委員會規定額內，限三個月內辦妥交換。所得外棉部份，作爲各廠自備存棉諭。</p>
<p>各廠代紡棉紗，每件紗用棉量，參照行總配棉合約，定爲美棉四五三磅。其含水量爲百分之八，含雜質量爲百分之○·五。如用國棉，按所含水雜情形，比例增加。</p>
<p>各廠代紡棉紗，其應得代紡工繳及利潤，由會邀集各有關方面，組織棉紗成本審議會，製定公式計算之。</p>
<p>上項計算公式，在棉紗成本　　會未製定以前，所有計算之各項因素，得參照行總配棉合約所定工繳棉二五九磅半定案時之棉價，與當時各項指數之比價，及前紡　會規定之卅六年九月份二　支棉紗代紡工繳百分比　計算之。</p>
<p>紡紗工繳由本會每旬按照上月代紡棉紗件數，及計算公式，預付一次，每月月終補足當月實初件數應得工繳，及指數差額。</p>
<p>代紡谷廠，除各具保證外，並由紗　相仿之廠，互相保證。駐廠員得暫行緩派，如代紡各廠，不能履行保證責任時，本會得仍派駐廠員。</p>
<p>本辦法呈奉經濟部核准後施　，修改時同。</p>
<h3>棉紗登記期限　展至本月十四</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕紗管會辦理本市棉紗登記，前經規定自一月二十九日起，至二月六日止，爲登記期限，並經公吿有關同業公會，日前各有關同業公會，以各廠用紗支數繁多，檢驗需時，以致棉紗登記證不能如限塡妥，送請驗明核發，請予寬限。據悉：該會已准將登記期限展至本月十四日爲止，幷公吿週知。</p>
<h3>棉紗疲挫　布疋下游</h3>
<p>昨日棉紗市况，以紡建開紗，配價减低，散戶吐售，買戶甚稀，喊價全面疲挫。迨至結果，四十二支藍鳳細紗，比上日續跌一白二十萬元，爲五千九百十萬元。共餘各支粗細紗，一致軋挫二三十萬至二百萬左右不等。</p>
<p>昨日棉布市况，晨開交易即呈閒散，同業納胃轉呆，客帮亦鮮活動，行情邁步下游。結果十二磅龍頭等各檔細布，較之上日續跌五千至二三萬元。此外　嘰細斜及士林布脚地穩固，其餘各布市均疲軟。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕中國紡建公司昨循例售紗，共售二七九件，合廿支紗五三九件，申購單一○四張，廿支紅蜂售三四二○萬元。</p>
<p>現棉飛升</p>
<p>昨日現棉市况飛升，業外銀根甚寬，需求頗殷。同業執貨不售，塲上籌碼枯竭，市價節節上漲。靈寳喊價七百萬，市氣鋒俏無比，嗣以紗布回灣，趨勢稍軟，結果六九五萬有成交。</p>
<h3>收購廠商成品　昨通過卅餘件</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕四聯分處昨日下午舉行之行局代政府收購各廠商成品審査會議，其申請案件共達四十件，通過約卅件，金額總値約三百億元。今日為申請收購截止日期，廠商如當日送交案件至行局庫者，以下午一時前爲限，過期不再接受。又悉明日（八日）雖値星期，四聯分處之審査會議仍於當日下午二時肌常舉行，辦理未了案件云。</p>
<h3>食米市塲　情形混亂</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕米市塲定自今日起休假七天，至新正初五（十四日）開　。各零售米號依照向例，初一休假，初二至初四半日營業，初五起恢復全日營業。舊曆新年米市休假期中，社　局規定各米號門售價，每石仍不得超過一百六十萬元。</p>
<p>昨米市情形混亂，有貨者軋頭寸，紛紛脫手求售。而手頭寬裕者，則欲保特物資，向市塲收購。因之同樣米類，有高至一百八十萬元者，亦有低至一百四十餘萬者。據社曾局長吳開先向記者表示：當局決定於開　盤時拋售國米，爲期至少連續半月，數在十五萬祖以上，抛售價格已由民食調配委員會常務委員葉實夫，晋京向糧食部請示。</p>
<p>秈挺升</p>
<p>油市　軟</p>
<p>昨日南北兩市共到米糧三千三百石左右，早市依然上漲，粳秈米續加三四萬元，白元高貨亦兌挺秀，中次胃呆少神，午時收盤消化轉懈，當局定明年紅盤即將開始配米。麵粉微升三五千元，麩皮略升四五千元。豆備續漲三五千至萬元不一</p>
<p>黃豆　進三叫萬元。</p>
<p>油市廠方大量供應，人心虛軟，重見下游。生豆油挫落四五萬元，菜油亦跌三五萬元，蔴油堅定之格。</p>
<h3>食糖塲外上升</h3>
<p>食糖市塲昨日起休假七天，惟塲外交易　夕。喊價續見上升。現貨合糖除中砂貨多獨疲外，蔴袋車白精二一五萬元，粗砂二一○萬元，較上日各再漲起二萬與三萬元。第五六期中砂棧　大包一八四萬，小包一八一萬，微堅萬元光景。興化高白叩二百萬大關，興化高赤一七八萬，各升六萬與八萬元，提莊靑一五六萬，軋漲四萬元。</p>
<h3>捲菸肥皂續漲</h3>
<p>昨日捲菸市况，因農曆春怖期問，門莊銷路暢旺，塲內買氣籠罩，漲風　本加厲。十支大英每箱竟衡破四千萬關，高至四千二百萬爲收價。比上日賡續飛騰二百三十萬元。老刀烟亦漲一百六十萬元，其餘中外各烟及五十支聽烟，一致軋升自一千五百無至二萬餘元不一。</p>
<p>昨日用品肥皂市面，因派貨消息沉悶，本街門市走銷奇暢，塲內添補基强，客帮動辦亦勁，更有大戶拉提，行情扶搖直上。結果固本　刀兩皂又狂漲十二三萬元。祥茂光華美麗等皂，亦升五萬及一二萬元。火柴亦均步升二三十萬，雜牌上升五十餘萬元。</p>
<h3>華股市况淸閒　形勢疲途徘徊</h3>
<p>華股昨迫於年關，塲外旣有大戶供售，塲內復有業中人在即交中了桔，套轉塲外，中途十分萎靡，小型股形勢反形穩健。</p>
<p>晨開時人心不支，塲外有査帳，及行莊銀根見緊而低疲，永紗以七二○元及七五七元上塲，七一號等吸納即交，升爲七二六元及七六二元，一一七號等出即交四五號出遞交，塲外息價開高至三角一分半及三角六，逐步退至六八八元及七三○元，九五號趁低吸現而稍盤，二二○號等仍抛即交，塲外有大戶陸續斬多，步降至六八〇元及七二六元低價。一五七號等趁低吸納即交，午收微升爲六八四元及七二七元。結果較前收即交股信誼榮　美亞跌一成，永紗閘北信和商務華豐火柴永公　安景福勤興內衣中法中絲跌半成，餘均微降。遞交股美亞跌一成，永紗信和　　跌半成，餘均小挫。</p>
<p>後市一九三號等進即交，永紗自六九三元及七二八元起，升至七一二元及七三六元。一五六號等出即交，又退至六九三元及七二三元。國行交換差出一千多億，一八五號等進即交，九四號買遞交，回升至七一○元及七四○元，一○三號等有供，收市爲七○六元及七三七元。閘北勤興等小股穩健逾恒，結果較晨收計即交股信誼尚平，統益新光勤興國貨各漲半成，餘股升降俱微。遞交股均吿小升，塲外各未上市股票亦迫於銀根，俱見虛軟。</p>
<h3>統債外股萎靡</h3>
<p>公債昨又疲落，統丙晨開六萬九，高價七萬一，低價五萬七，最後在六萬元關口掙扎，成交約四百萬。結果較前收計甲乙各跌五千元，丙丁戊挫落七千元。</p>
<p>外股昨呆滯而略疲，歲尾年終，交易亦寥寥無幾。怡紗祇萬餘元上落，過程平庸之至，銀行帮賣出，證券帮略進。怡紗晨開五五萬，高價五六萬五，而後在五六萬左右徘徊。結果較前收計鋼業電話跌半成，怡紗英聯會德豐怡啤電車微降，紙版墾植尙平。</p>

<h3>羣書治要裏的晉書</h3>
<p>— 胡適</p>
<p>晋書的重撰在貞觀二十年。其時魏徵已死了一二年了。（魏徵死在十七年正月。）魏徵修成羣書治要時，他的官　是「秘書監，鉅鹿男」。他修治要的年代在哎觀初年，約在貞觀三年至六年之間。（看太宗紀及魏微傳。）但治要有晋書兩卷（卷廿九，卅。）這常然不是重　後的晋書了。</p>
<p>我看黃奭輯的各家晋書（漢學堂逸書考），參考房玄齡傳說的「以臧榮緖晋書爲主」一句話，再用今本唐修晋　對勘，我可以猜想羣書治要收的晋書是臧榮緖的晋書。（黃爽也收治要的晋書，但題爲「羣書治要所載晋書」，列在「衆家晋史」之內。）試用治要的晋書的劉毅傳（西晋的劉毅），與黃奭所輯臧書劉毅傳，與今本晋書劉毅傳，三本相比較；再用這三本的陶侃傳相比較；就可以知這治要所收的是臧榮緒的晋書，又可以知道今本晋書沿用臧書的文字最多。</p>
<p>晋書文字上的雋永優美，大部分因襲前人的著作。其中臧榮緖的晋害要算一個最重要的來源。試取黃奭輯的臧書阮籍傳六條，其文字都與今本晋書全同。又如黃爽輯的太平御覽五百十二引的臧書王湛傳三百餘字，今本晋書王湛傳完全採用了。此諸傳爲治要所未收，但可以證明唐修晋書確是「以臧書爲主」也。</p>
<p>治要所收晋書，我們旣考定爲臧書，又知臧書爲唐修晋書的主要底本，故可以用來校勘今本晋書。向來校勘晋書的學者，都不曾利用此治要本。我偶用此本的江統傳來校今本晋書卷五十六的江統傳，開卷即有所得，因細校之，竟得一本初唐本的徙戎論！我舉一例：江統傳說他</p>
<p>除山陰令。時關隴屢爲氐羌所擾，孟觀西討，自擒氐帥齊萬年。統深惟四夷亂華，宜杜其萌，乃作徙戎論（宋本，殿本）。</p>
<p>治要本晋書作「除華陰令」，「自擒」作「生擒」。此我所謂開卷即有所得也。山陰之當作華陰，向來校晋書諸公都不曾看出。嚴可均輯全晋文，他已見治要的晋書了。故他作江統的小傳，已改山陰爲華陰。但他不曾用治要本細校徙戎論，只注明此論見於今本晋書，洽要本晋書，通典（一八九）與御覽（七九四）四書而已。此四本之中，洽要本晋書爲最早，尙不避太宗高宗廟諱，如下舉數例，都可寳貴也：</p>
<p>從戎論　（今本管書）（治要本晋書）　　　咸未能以通化率導</p>
<p>咸未能以道化</p>
<p>導　與華人雜處</p>
<p>與齊民雜處</p>
<p>夷夏俱斃</p>
<p>夷夏俱弊</p>
<p>士庶　習　吏民　習</p>
<p>誠宜　之以安豫</p>
<p>誠宜　之以靜默而綏之以安豫</p>
<p>以無穀之人　以無殼之民</p>
<p>理之於未亂　治之於未亂</p>
<p>今百姓失職，猶或亡叛。今晉民失職，猶或亡叛。</p>
<p>這裏面多數的例子是避諱的例子。但第八例的原文「晉民」（就是「中國人民」）比「百姓」明白多了。</p>

<p>自漢武帝通西南夷以後，史記兩漢書都有西南夷傳，紀述西南事情。其以西南的人著書專紀西南如雲南的歷史者，只有成都楊終的哀牢傳。楊終書已不傳，僅後漢書西南夷傳　懷太子注引有一條，述哀牢夷九隆氏自禁高至扈眾凡八代名稱。楊終書以後，晋常　華陽國志也竹約略紀到雲南。太平御　所引書有永昌記和永昌郡傳，另有南中八郡志。南中八郡志也見於　文類聚，自是唐以前書。中有永昌一郡，其餘七郡，類聚御　所引都未說及。不過其巾提到交阯（御覽九一○）邛河（御　七九一），是八郡志的內容也相富廣泛。永昌記提到哀牢王（御覽三五八）。永昌郡傳則於永昌郡外，並叙述到雲南東部的朱提建寗興古三郡（御覽七九一，七八一，五五六。）這都是後漢以迄蜀漢所建的郡，齊以後始廢。故永昌郡傳或許也是唐以前的作品，與哀牢傳同爲紀述雲南的最古文獻。</p>
<p>魏晋以後，雲南與中國的關係日漸疏遠。北周武帝天和五年（西元後五七○）命大將軍鄭烙率師平越雋，於其地置四寗州，只到今日西康的西昌一帶。隋文帝開皇十七年，史萬歲平西寗羌，進討南寗夷覺　，度西二河入渠臨川，破其三十餘部。西二河即是洱海，而渠溫川則今　戰。南詔時之稱大撤亦曰史險，當與史萬歲有關也。到了唐朝，與西南交往日繁，使節往來不絕於書，於是山川能賦，成為著作。如袁滋　雲南記，　齊休的雲南行記，樊綽　蠻書，寳滂的雲南別錄，徐雲雯的南詔錄諸　，都出之於目識親覽。爲今日硏究唐代南詔史的第一手資料。袁滋　齊休諸人之作雖已不傳，而從御覽通鑑考異所引，得見一　片爪，猶可以見其梗概。今就所知，略考如次。</p>
<p>唐與雲南的關係，高宗時始見著錄，咸亨初（西　後六七○左右）將軍李義（舊唐書作李義總駱賓王集作李義）率師伐姚州羣蠻。駱賓王文集卷九有兵部奏姚州破逆賊柳諾設楊雯柳露布及兵部奏姚州破賊設蒙儉等露布二文，即紀此役。天寳初，雲南叛唐與吐蕃合，時擾西川。至德宗貞元初，南詔異牟尋苦於吐蕃的征斂無度，因淸平官鄭回之勸，有歸唐之志。其時西川節度使爲韋皋，遂發書招論。貞元九年，西川與南詔定約；十年南詔破吐蕃於神川，同年六月，唐　袁滋爲册南詔使，至雲南。袁滋的雲南記，就是紀此行見聞之作：唐人著書言雲南，常以袁氏之作爲最早。</p>
<p>袁滋字德深，蔡州朗山人，新唐書一五一有傳，舊唐書一八五入良吏傳。據新書南詔傳，貞元十年一次的出使，以袁滋爲持節册南詔使，成都少尹　頎　之，崔佐時劉幽嚴爲判官，俱文珍爲宣慰使。袁滋諸人入雲南，走的是北路，新唐書地理志戎州開邊下小注云。</p>
<p>自縣南七十里至七十里。又四百八十里至石門鎮，隋開皇五年率益漢二州兵所開。又經鄧杭山馬鞍波，二百五十里至阿旁部落。又經蒙夔山，百九十里至阿夔部落。又百八十里渝官川，又經薄唩川，百五十里至界江山下。又經荊溪口　　池，三百二十里至湯麻頓。又二百五十里至拓東城。又經安寗井三百九十里至曲水。又經石鼓，二百二十里渡石門，至佉龍驛。又六十里至雲南城。又八十里至白崖城。又八十里至龍尾城。又四十里至羊苴嘩城。貞元十年詔祠部郞中袁滋與內給事劉貞</p>
<p>諒使南詔由此。</p>
<p>劉貞諒即俱文珍，從義父姓後改爲劉。這就是蠻書的北路，唐代一穩爲石門路。地理志所云開皇五年益漢二州兵開路一事，也見於　書。　書卷一雲南界內途程紀北路云。</p>
<p>從石門外川魯望昆川至雲南，謂之北路。從黎州淸溪關出邛部，過會通至雲南，謂之南路。從戎州南十日程至石門，上有隋初刋記處云：開皇五年十月二十五日，兼　曹黃榮領始益二州石匠，　石四孔，各深一丈，造偏梁槍閣，通越析州津州。蓋史萬歲南征，出於此也。」天　中鮮于仲通南溪下兵，亦是此路。使遂閉絕。僅五十年來，貞元十年南詔立功蹄化，朝廷發使册命，而邛部　路方有吐蕃侵鈔隔關。其年七月，西川節度韋皋乃遺巡官監察御史馬益開石門路，置行館。（所引蠻書文字，依拙著　書校注，對四庫本微有是正）。</p>
<p>這裏的石門，在今雲南　津縣境內。今　津縣豆沙關路左摩　上還存有袁滋入雲南時經過此地的摩量題名一篇，文日。</p>
<p>大唐貞元十年□□□□九月廿日，雲南宣慶使，內給事俱文珍，判官劉幽嚴，小使吐突承璀，持節册南認使御史巾承袁滋，副使成都少尹龐頎，判官監察御史崔佐時，同奉恩命，赴雲南，册豪異牟等爲南詔。其時節度使尙書右　射成都尹兼御史大夫韋　差巡官監察御史馬益，統行營兵馬，開路置驛。故刊石紀之。袁滋題。題名八行，俱左行，全文楷書，惟袁滋題三字篆文。袁滋是唐代的一位書家，以篆隸著稱常時，其篆書唐廣銘，知者甚多，楷書極少見。此一題名，可以補正兩唐書及蠻書之處不少。而所謂石門路，我又疑心就是秦漢以來自四川通雲南的五尺道，史記西南夷列傳「秦時常頞略通五尺道。」一語張守節正義云。</p>
<p>括地志云，五尺道在郞州。顏師古云，其處險阨，故道纔廣五尺。如淳云，道廣五尺也。</p>
<p>唐時的郞州屬戎州都督府管，轄味，同樂，升麻，同起，新豐，隴隄，泉麻七縣，當今昭通以南，至於曲靖陸凉諸縣地。故括地志所指郞州境內的五尺道，大概就是石門路；隋唐兩代不過予以修理而已。權載之文集卷四有送袁中丞持節册南詔五韻一首，即贈袁滋使雲南者，詩云，</p>
<p>西南使星去，遠徼通朝聘。烟雨僰道深，麾幢漢儀盛。途輕五尺險，水愛雙流凈。上國洽恩波，外臣遵禮命。離堂駐　馭，且蓋　中聖。</p>
<p>因爲袁滋諸人走的石門路，就是秦漢以來的五尺道，所以權載之詩有途輕五尺峻之語。這也可以作石門路即五尺道一說的證明。</p>
<p>舊唐書袁滋傳說滋「因使行著雲南記五卷」，新唐書藝文志著錄此書，卷數同。宋史藝文志未著錄，又不見於郡　讀書志諸書。太平御覽引有雲南記兩條，我疑心是韋齊休的雲南行記，說見下，袁滋的書，大概到宋代已經不存了，所以司馬溫公作通　攷異也沒有　針。大典本　書卷十的末了有一段袁滋册立　年尋爲雲南王的紀事，自袁滋到拓東起，至册封完畢回到戊州爲止，凡一千多字。文章爾雅，排日叙事，極爲翔實；新唐書南詔傳也有這樣的一段。這很可能就是取之於袁滋的雲南記；袁氏書可攷者僅止於此。根據　唐書，通鑑，册府元　，以及雲書的紀載，我們可以推知袁滋諸人大概是貞元十年五月受命，六月離長安，七月馬益修石門路，九月廿日過石門，十月十五日至安寗城，十九日到曲驛，二十一日過欠舍川，二十三日到雲南城，二十四日到白崖城，二十六日過大和城抵陽苴嘩，二十七日行册封禮。十一月七日事畢東歸，發陽苴嘩城，二十四日至石門，更十日，即十二月初四日，到戎州。自戎州出發，往返大約三月。</p>
<p>南詔自天寳時背唐起至貞元十年，中間經歷四十多年，始又奉唐朝的正翔。袁滋奉使，在當時一定轟動了長安，也一定有不少的人爲文為詩以壯其行的。但是現在我們只從權載之集由見到贈詩一首。載之又有送袁由亟持節册廻鵑序一首，序文開篇說今春廻鵑君長納忠內附，以下說的全是滇池昆明的事，以唐蒙諸葛武侯爲喻。這篇序顯然也是送袁滋使雲南之作，何以題目以及文內都　錯上鵑二字？其故不得而知。</p>
<p>自貞元十年（西元後七九四）袁滋使雲南，歸著雲南記以後，經過三十年，到穆宗長慶三年（西元後八二三），又有韋審規之使雲南。隨行者有韋齊休，著雲南行記二卷，蓋紀此行見聞之作也。晁公武郡齊讀書志卷七僞史類紀韋齊休雲南行記云，</p>
<p>韋齊休雲南行記二卷，長慶三年從韋審規使雲南，記往來道里及見聞。序謂雲南所以能爲唐患者，以開這越書耳。若自黎州之南淸溪關外，盡斥棄之，疆塲可以無虞，不然憂未艾也。及唐之亡，禍果由此。本朝棄　州不守，而蜀無邊患。以此論之，則齊休之言，可不謂韋審規使雲南一事，不見兩唐書，審規齋休兩書亦無傳。新唐書　相世系表韋氏平齊公房韋淡之子韋　規，　州刺史，爲韋竣六世孫。元和姓　則謂　規爲韋漸子；此與使雲南之　規是一人。韋齊休，不見世系表及姓纂，太平廣記卷三百四十八韋齊休條引河　記志云，</p>
<p>韋齊休擢進士第，累官至員外郞，爲王璠浙西團練副史，太和八年卒於渭州之官舍云云。</p>
<p>此韋齊休與使雲南者同時，疑則其人，唯事蹟別無可攷。案舊唐書穆宗紀載有長慶三年秋九月「南詔王丘佺進金碧文絲十有六品」一事，通鑑唐紀穆宗長慶三年秋七月「南詔勸利卒國人請立其弟　祐」條　異日，</p>
<p>實錄九月辛酉南詔王立佺進其國信。歲末又云，南詔請立蒙勸利之弟　祐，云立佺者蓋誤也。今從新傳。</p>
<p>舊書丘佺當即實錄之立佺。新書南詔傳謂南詔勸龍晨於憲宗元和十一年（西元後八一六）爲弄楝節度王嵯類所殺，立其弟勸利，詔少府少　李銑爲册立弔祭使；長慶三年始賜印。是歲勸利死，弟　祐立。舊書南詔王丘佺或寶錄王立佺指的或是弄棟節度王嵯顚，丘佺嵯顛不渦是同名異譯。而韋審規韋齊休於長慶三年使雲南，其所負使命常即爲賜南詔印。</p>
<p>韋齊休雲南行記宋以後即不傳。宋史藝文志著錄，齋休作齊沐，齊又作濟。御覽引雲南記二十三條，其九一九卷鵝，九二四卷　，九七四苷庶，所引雲南記都提到韋齊休，今抄示如次：</p>
<p>韋齊休使雲南，屯城　　墻外有大池斗門埀柳夾陰，池中鵝鴨甚衆。（九一九）</p>
<p>韋齊休使至雲南，其國饋白　，皆生致之。（九二四）</p>
<p>唐韋齊休聘雲南，會川都督劉寬使使致苷庶，蔗節希似竹，許，削去後亦有甜味。（九七四）</p>

<h3>尹洙王安石論「校事」</h3>
<p>— 漆俠</p>
<p>曹魏孫吳的校事制度，由胡適之先生的考證，（文見大公報文史週刋）使我們知道遠在千七百年前就有過「特務組織」了。在北宋時代（十一世紀時），尹師魯（洙）王荊公（安石）已經先後批評過這種制度。尹洙的河南先生文集卷十八諭朝政宜務大體疏：</p>
<p>伏惟陛下采漢臣窺私之誡，鑒吳主「校事」之弊……</p>
<p>又同書卷二矯察察</p>
<p>前世居國者，或喜聞外事，任察爲明。有陳閭里之事者，嘉其無隱，以爲傾盡；至其垢汙忠賢，害莫甚焉。是以鉤黨之禍，發於近習；吿密之獄，起於廣聽。</p>
<p>這一段中雖沒有提及校事，但所謂「汙垢忠賢」的人，即指校事而言。其後王荊公也論及此事，他的議論比較尹洙的更爲明快。紋資洽通鑑長編卷二四○：</p>
<p>熙寗五年十一月戊辰，……馮京言：「阜城司近差探事人多，人情頗不安。」上（神宗）日：「人數止如舊，探事亦不多，藍元震又小心。……此輩本令專探軍由事。若軍中但事嚴吿捕之法，亦可以防變。」（王）安石曰：「專令探軍中事即無妨。若恃此輩伺察外事，恐不免作過。孫權曹操用法至嚴，動輒殺誅，然用趙逵（似當作達）」壹之徒，皆能作姦亂政。陛下寬仁不忍誅罰，焉能保此輩不作姦？三代聖王且不論，如漢高祖唐太宗已不有爲孫權曹操所爲。但明示好惡賞罰，使人臣忠信，皆不敢誕謾，天下事安有蔽匿不聞者？細碎事從不聞，何損於治體？欲聞細碎事，却致此輩作姦，即所損治體不細。」上以爲然。</p>
<p>看上面所引，荊公對這種制度的性質及流弊，說得很淸楚了。他指出趙達呂壹，正是魏吳的「校事制度」。</p>

<p>自由談</p>
<h3>關於思想自由</h3>
<p>— 玄玄</p>
<p>日前讀到本欄靖文君一篇文章，對於被整肅的蘇聯經濟學權威伐爾加　致敬意，意思是伐爾加能忠於他的觀點，不肯因政治的或其他的原因，而改變他對於資本主義動向的結論。</p>
<p>伐爾加被整肅的事，最先見於「紐約時報」，距今已在一星期以上，蘇聯方面至今尙朱否認，再證諸「紐約時報」在新聞界的地位，此事之可信，似屬無疑。</p>
<p>以伐爾加在蘇聯經濟學界的聲望之隆，居然在這肅淸西方思想的狂潮裏，輪到整　，自然引起非常的注意，尤其在蘇聯這樣一個國家，以伐爾加受蘇聯當局倚畀之深（戰時任史達林經濟顧問），居然不顧上峯的千涉，而堅持其十年內資本主義並無不景氣的結諭，則尤有重大意義。思想的自由是無可抑止的，不論在思想自由的環境裏，或是在思想並不自由的環境裘。</p>
<p>我們於此不妨再舉出一個例來，看一看兩種思想家的態度。</p>
<p>去年九月，蘇聯也有過一次學術辯諭會（這次伐爾加被淸算，大約也是出於此種方式），召集人是政治局的委員日丹諾夫，辯諭的主題是亞歷山大洛夫的暢銷書「西歐哲學史」，出席的是蘇聯有數的哲學界人物。　　所奇的是亞歷山大洛夫並不是無名之輩，他是蘇共的中央執委，得過「史達林獎金」，又是蘇聯第一流的理論家。他的「西　哲學史」所以成爲問題，是由於推崇了西方哲學的地位。</p>
<p>在這次辯論會中，亞歷山大洛夫却並不像伐爾加一樣。他究全「承認」自己的錯誤，願「自動」修改他的理論，於是一塲風波，便吿平息。</p>
<p>在這裏，我們可以看到思想家的兩種態度，一種是堅持的，忠於自己的理論的，其殉道精神有如古代印度的高僧，自然値得佩服。另一種則是屈就的，與政治妥協的，其地位與前者當然大不相同。但在這裏，筆者便有這樣一個私見：與其責備學術屈就政治的事實，還不如責備政治委屈學術的制度。亞歷山大洛夫固然孱弱，但他的過失也祗在孱弱而已，殺害學術的責任還得由使之孱弱的環境來負之。</p>
<p>世人往往多責難受害的人，而於加害於人者反而輕易放過。在慕尼赫尸後，受騙的張伯倫較之騙人的希特勒挨駡更多，實在並不是公平的事。流俗的眼光，往往失諸輕重的權衡，終至昧於事理之本末。</p>
<p>伐爾加固然可嘉，亞歷山天洛夫亦無大過，對於「西歐哲學史」，我們仍可尊重其未「修正」時的原狀，而對於思想不能自由的那種空氣，却實在不得不加以抨擊。</p>
<h3>東條的秘密</h3>
<p>這裏有一個關於東條英機的秘密，也許東條自己也不知道的。</p>
<p>美國在珍珠港事變發生以後，全國朝野一致表示憤慨，從那時起，最流行的一句口號是「毋忘珍珠港」，當然，身歷戎行的美軍將士更是念茲在茲，無時去懷的。</p>
<p>而到了現在，東條英機倒眞做到了「沒齒不忘」的程度。</p>
<p>事實是這樣的：一天，駐日美軍當局突然召集了三個年靑的美國海軍軍官，這三個人在入伍以前本來都是掛牌做牙醫生的。這三個軍官報到之後，那位長官給他們的命令是：到巢鴨監獄裘去和一個戰犯看齒病。</p>
<p>他們到了監獄裏才知道原來他們的病人就是巢　監獄囚中的頭兒腦兒東條英機——東條的假齒壞了，要請他們重新配一副假齒。</p>
<p>這三位念念不忘珍珠港的軍官們靈機一動，過了幾天便把新的假齒送進監獄，　送　覺得十分滿意。</p>
<p>但是，他不知這那副假齒的上頭上有一行整整齊齊的小凹點——如果照電報號碼讀起來，正好是一句話：「毋忘珍珠港」！　　（如意）</p>
<h3>民主的學校</h3>
<p>— 則仕</p>
<p>在月前民主民主之聲喊得驚天動地之際，據我所知，有一件事最足以表現民主，就是學校。事實是報載本市（上海）訊：</p>
<p>市敎育局發表，本市國民學校未達一保一校標準，學齡兒童志願入學者，尙感無法全部收容，故三十六年度工作計劃，仍以增設國民學校及學級，儘量收容學齡兒童，與鼓勵私人興學爲中心工作。經一年來努力結果，國民學校之增設，以限於經費未能達到預期目標，而私立初等學校之增加，則爲數可觀。本年內國民學校增設三十八校，增收學生二萬二千七百十八人，私立學校增設三百三十校，增收學生五萬三千餘人。總計本市現有市立初等學校三二一校，學生十六萬一千五百九十六人；私立初等學校現有一一六二校，學生二十三萬二千零十四人</p>
<p>由此觀之，私立初等學校所收之學生，較市立考約多百分之五十，如公家方面「限於經費」下去，繼續「鼓勵私人興學」不已，不久的將來市立初等校將如鳳毛麟角，而私立學校則如雨後之春筍。依照舊說，初等即小學敎育是義務敎育或稱强迫敎育，即由政府廣設學校，强迫學齡兒童入學。現在我們已改爲「志願入學」，民主之風一。公家方面自謙限於經費，鼓勵私人興學，民主之風二。逍一點民主尤爲可貴，因據英國（可惜不是炎國！）某敎育學家云，最民主的敎育即在於將敎育脫離國家之手，因國家常常利用敎育爲工具，以達其某種目的，一如舊日之敎會。</p>
<p>然而人民有時候脾氣頗爲古怪，例如對於民主，有些地方力爭民主，雖頭破血流亦所不辭，有些地方却力辭民主，固辭不獲就要輿論大譁，如上文所說的學校民主化，倘能廣徵民意，結果一定不以爲然。什麽道理並不難解；市立學校學費廉，私立學校學費貴，而人民中十有九捨貴而取廉，因共窮也。從這點看來，恐怕私立學校愈多，入學兒童將愈少。故曰學校（尤其是初等的）民主之風不可長。</p>
<p>我不想責備賢者：公家在別的經費上，如汽油費，茶點費，鷄尾酒費，修理給舞女打毀的門窗桌椅費等總有法想，而獨於初等敎育經費終歸一直「限於」？我只想建議：　鼓勵私人與學不如進而爲官商合辦。　　經費「限於」，可設捐稅以不「限於」之。　　私立學校學費之所以貴，我不知道，公立學校學費之廉其故何在我亦不詳。但一貴一廉我是知道的，完全公立旣然限於經費，與私立的合作經營當爲不得已而求其次的補救之道。假定一所公立小學每年須賠本一百元，而一所私立小學每年必須盈利二十元，那麼公家對私人說，你的二十元利潤由我致送，不准向學生上頭上得之，在私人失之學生者得之公家，旣無投失當可欣然遵辦，而學費照本收取，必可减低不少。在公家則一校之費可助五校，亦何樂而不爲。否則儘管拼命鼓勵私人興學而萬一私人志不在學，結果非學費出乎情理的高，即學生雖有志願入學，亦限於學校大門八字開有志無錢莫進來而壯志全灰。</p>
<p>至於公家補助私人的那筆錢呢，生財之道多端。譬如說跳舞不禁而每一舞票加徵敎育捐一萬或十萬百萬，收入一定可觀，以之興學不愁不足，而且倘能早日想到，修現社會局門窗桌椅的幾十億就可移充敎育經費，也有幾所國民小學可辦。如跳舞非禁不可，那麼趁電影院尙未關門之前，每張電影票徵收敎育捐若干亦必爲數甚鉅無疑。</p>
<p>假如敎育當局眞是　力於敎育的，那麼今年應照我的辦法為努力中心。結果一定良好，其功我決不搶。</p>
<h3>逍遙花</h3>
<p>— 陳慎言</p>
<h3>第十章　自願犧牲（六五）</h3>
<p>绮紈不知毓如是何用意，一雙星眸，仍注在老人臉上。毓如又道：「可惜你們相識太晚，渚齊業已成家了，若是我知道，我一定……」說到這裏，連迎搖頭，表示惋惜。綺執見老人如此表示，出於意外，嚇得目瞪口呆，接着又聽毓如道：「你是個好孩子，你是知靈識禮的，我們舊家庭對舊禮教觀念，應得努力維持，你一定能帮助我。我今天來你這裏，特來向你請求，以六十多歲一個老頭子，今天特造府請求，你應想像得出來，這事關係我整個家庭，是如何　重的。」绮執見毓如如此鄭重說着，知道事情或有變卦，眼皮一抬，向毓如看了一眼，問道：「老先生，您有什麼事，不妨直說。我不是糊涂人，什麼事都應遵照道理辦去。」毓如如把頭點一點道：「我想你一定能諒解我，渚　是我獨生子，我老夫婦二人合共一百三十多歲，只有這一個兒子，自他成家之後，我老夫婦唯一希望，就是他兩小和好，平日抱個小孫。這種思想，在現代潮流，當然是落伍，可是我是這種家庭，這種環境，所以這陳舊的觀念，仍舊是不能排除。今天我來這裏，有一句很冒眛問你，渚齋是否每夭必來找你？你二人是否已有婚約？希望你吿訴我。」綺　一聽這話，立時站起來道：「是的，我們已訂婚了。」毓如道：「你對這事老慮過沒有？你知道我家庭狀况嗎？」綺紈道：「我全知道，我已經考慮過了，我們是由精神結合的，我想我們將來，如環境不良，我可以咬菜根，輔助渚　，渡過難關，絕不會因生活困難，發生問題，老先生對此層可無須國慮。」毓如把頭徵微一搖道：「你看錯了，我所　感覺困難，不是生活問題，而是我家庭上處理的問題渚　齋和你結婚，必須和他的娘婦離婚，這一　我家庭不能通過，尤其是渚齋的母親非常反對，將來你到我家是沒名分的，你雖然愛渚　，你連這一點名分，都不爭嗎？」</p>
<h3>邱吉爾回憶錄一臠</h3>
<p>— 雷紅</p>
<p>邱吉爾在起草他不朽的回憶錄了。他的報吿中一定包括下面這個故事　　在舉行在德黑蘭會議時，他要求和史太林單獨會面，在場的除了一個譯員之外，別無他人。他們的會議一共有四小時半。會談中史太林除了吿訴他各項待商的要件外，還講起蘇聯的政治組織，每一公民怎樣可以興起於政界或經濟界等等閑話。</p>
<p>接着他們又講起蘇聯懷疑英美的施政。「你以爲我們是在進攻貴國嗎？」邱吉爾問他。</p>
<p>史太林點點頭。</p>
<p>邱吉爾再問：「閣下何以認爲如此？」　　「因爲」，史太林說，「如其我是閣下，也要這樣幹的！」</p>

<h3>白宮的接綫生</h3>
<p>— 毛毅</p>
<p>白宮自從一八七八年架設電話以來，一直是由男子管理的。直到一九三三年三月七日的早晨以後，才由一個姓哈區米絲苔的女性接手。</p>
<p>這位女士在美國政府的發　簿上所列的姓名是：「路易士莉連·哈區米絲苔女士。」不過，已故的羅斯福總統，他的住在白宮的家人，他的下屬和閣員都簡呼她爲「哈基」。有的人如此稱呼她是出乎親熱，但是，大部份人則爲了簡便　　哈基在少女時代根本沒有夢想到有一天她會與各國的總統，帝王，貴人，顯宦交談。在起初，她不免戰戰競競，有些恐懼。但是，幾年下來她就自然了。當羅斯福夫人邀請英皇喬治六世和英后伊莉莎白在海德公園舉行「熱狗」野餐時，哈基也被邀作陪，那時她已在白宮服務六年，一切都已老練，所以她能够不用過分的練習，便會在聲後從容的與貴賓們握手道別。</p>
<p>在羅斯福任內，白宮的接綫生們都將重要的電話號碼記在她們的腦子裘。當新政推行之際，電話最爲忙碌。新的機關不時的大批成立。哈基每天晚上入眠前的第一椿工作就是背誦和記憶道些新機關的電話號碼。從那時起，她便替她自己建立了一個小型的電話參考圖書館。有好些簿于都是專門登錄私人的　電話號碼的。</p>
<p>當杜魯門總統闔家遷入白宮的時候，哈基和她的下屬們又開始記憶起另一大批新的號碼，不過，這些號碼與以前比較起來却减少多了。哈基將杜魯門和他的家人所打的每一個新號碼都記錄下來，她的下屬也做同漾的工作。不到幾天，她們都將最常打的號碼記牢了。</p>
<p>替杜魯門管理電話間，工作比羅斯福任內簡單得多。當羅斯福離開華盛頓出巡的時候，哈基總是他的隨負之一。因爲羅斯福極其依賴電話，而能够勝任轉接的工作的，首推哈基。每天早晨羅斯福一起床，電話機就開始忙碌，直到他人寢，　哈基才得休息。　　羅斯福有一個好習慣，不諭他在那裏他都吿知電話間。　他的秘書常會通知哈基：「總統正在伏案辦公」或者「他正在游泳池」。　　杜魯門則不同了，他沒有前任的習慣。而白宮的地方不算小，電話機又不算少，接那一座分機我總統最便捷呢？哈基是聰明的，如果她不知道杜魯門在那裏，便先打走廊裏的電話，呌守衛那所要道的保鑑吿訴她總統的行踪。　　雖然哈基在她的早年的電話訓練中知道「微笑的聲音」的接綫生的哲學，但是，她在白宮電話間內並不應用。「我不要我的女孩子們如糖似蜜的一般」，他說，「我祗要她們愉快到不妨礙効率的程度。如果她們在她們的自己的時間內應用微笑的聲音，我是不加干涉的。」</p>
<p>每一個新的白宮接綫生都學會如何稱呼人們的階級或者銜頭。如果總統的紅燈亮了，接綫生便立即將撲落挿上，說道：「是的，總統先生。」對於對方，她們則說：「總統打來的，」或者僅說：「美國總統。</p>
<p>十幾年來，哈基一直操縱着「國家一四一四」這個電話號碼，她對工作是勝任且愉快。而她的最大的悲哀要算從不忘記在她的生日送禮給她的羅斯福的暴卒了，這悲哀不是時　所能消磨掉　。</p>

<h3>Ambassador Zheng's Reply to Bevin's Note: Full Text Released by Our Ministry of Foreign Affairs; Hong Kong Government Should Be Responsible for All Unfortunate Incidents in Kowloon Walled City; Urging Britain to Accept Our Proposed Solutions</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Office, 6th] The Foreign Ministry Spokesperson announced on the 6th that, regarding the Kowloon Walled City issue, our country's reply to the British Foreign Office's note to us on the 24th of last month was formally delivered by our Ambassador to Britain, Zheng Tianxi, to British Foreign Secretary Bevin on the 5th. The Nanjing Foreign Ministry also sent a copy to the British Ambassador to China, Steven, on the 6th. There have been no new developments in the negotiations with Britain for the past two days. The British Embassy also had no comment on the 6th.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Office, 6th] The Ministry of Foreign Affairs released the full text of the note from our Ambassador to Britain, Dr. Zheng Tianxi, on the 5th of this month, replying to British Foreign Secretary Mr. Bevin regarding the Kowloon Walled City incident. The Chinese translation is as follows:</p>
<p>Your Excellency,</p>
<p>I acknowledge receipt of Your Excellency's note of January 24, 1948, regarding the recent forced eviction of Chinese residents from Kowloon Walled City. I have read it carefully. As such, I, as Ambassador, have been instructed by the Chinese Government to reply as follows:</p>
<p>The Chinese Government must state that, regarding the jurisdiction of Kowloon Walled City, the Chinese Government has always insisted on its interpretation of the 1898 Convention Respecting an Extension of the Hong Kong Territory between China and Great Britain, believing that the convention clearly stipulates that China retains its jurisdiction over Kowloon Walled City. This interpretation is not only evident from the wording of the convention but is also confirmed by the provisions of various treaties concluded in the same year for the establishment of other leased territories. The principle of the policy adopted by the Chinese government at the time was to define a special area within each leased territory in which China would retain its jurisdiction. The application of this method was not limited to Kowloon Walled City alone. For example, Article 1 of the Treaty between China and Germany regarding Jiaozhou Bay, signed on March 6, 1898, and Article 4 of the Supplementary Treaty between China and Russia regarding the Liaodong Peninsula, signed on May 7, 1898, both contain clear provisions. Article 4 of the Russian Supplementary Treaty specifically stipulates: "The Russian nation, in accordance with the request of the Chinese nation, agrees to allow Jinzhou City to govern itself and to establish the necessary police force within the city."</p>
<p>Although the relevant clauses of the Convention Respecting an Extension of the Hong Kong Territory between China and Great Britain contain the phrase "the Chinese officials now stationed in Kowloon City" and stipulate that the exercise of jurisdiction by these Chinese officials should not interfere with the defense of Hong Kong, the so-called Chinese officials clearly do not refer only to the personnel holding official positions in Kowloon City at the time but also include their successors.</p>
<p>Furthermore, although the convention stipulates conditions regarding the defense of Hong Kong, it does not stipulate that Chinese officials must withdraw under any circumstances. On the contrary, the convention further stipulates that "the remainder of the newly leased territory shall be under the jurisdiction of Great Britain." From this provision, it can be inferred that Britain cannot exercise such jurisdictional rights in Kowloon Walled City.</p>
<p>Regarding Your Excellency's claim in the note that, except during the Japanese occupation period, the jurisdiction of Kowloon Walled City has been exclusively exercised by the Hong Kong government since 1899, I, as Ambassador, must cite several facts to Your Excellency, facts that Your Excellency is certainly already aware of. First, the reason why Chinese officials withdrew from Kowloon Walled City in 1899 and ceased to exercise jurisdiction in the city was purely due to being subjected to armed force. At the time, a protest was lodged. Second, since then, the Chinese government has not only never relinquished its jurisdictional rights in the area but has also strongly opposed any attempt by the Hong Kong government to seize this jurisdiction. It must be specifically mentioned that in 1946, the Chinese government formulated a plan to restore governance in Kowloon Walled City. The temporary shelving of this plan was purely out of consideration for maintaining friendly relations between China and Britain. It is recalled that the Governor of Hong Kong at the time issued a statement denying the right of the Chinese government to restore governance in Kowloon Walled City, and the spokesperson of the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs refuted it.</p>
<p>After learning in December last year that the Hong Kong government intended to forcibly evict Chinese residents from Kowloon Walled City and demolish their houses, the Chinese government repeatedly urged the British Embassy in China to warn the Hong Kong government not to resort to coercive measures. At that time, the Chinese government was already deeply aware that such measures could lead to serious consequences. However, the Hong Kong government disregarded these warnings and insisted on its own way, implementing various coercive actions on January 5 and January 12 of this year, which is truly regrettable. On January 12, a large contingent of armed Hong Kong police officers, wearing shields, helmets, and weaponry, and accompanied by a large number of coolies, entered Kowloon Walled City and opened fire on the residents before even firing tear gas, resulting in injuries to several residents on the spot, including two seriously injured.</p>
<p>Therefore, the Chinese government firmly believes that the Hong Kong government should be held clearly responsible for all the unfortunate incidents in Kowloon Walled City. The government flagrantly took such provocative actions while bilateral discussions between Britain and China were underway to seek a peaceful resolution. This was the main reason for the deterioration of the situation, ultimately leading to subsequent incidents, such as the Shameen incident on January 16. From the Chinese government's point of view, it would be truly unfair to attribute the responsibility for the various unfortunate incidents in Kowloon Walled City to news reports or commentary.</p>
<p>The Chinese government also finds it difficult to accept Your Excellency's view that the Magistrate of Bao'an County should bear considerable responsibility for the Kowloon Walled City incident because he went to Kowloon Walled City for inspection. The Bao'an County Magistrate's visit to the city for inspection and to express condolences to the residents forcibly evicted on January 5 was merely the minimum action that a magistrate legally responsible for the administration of the city should undertake in the performance of his duties.</p>
<p>In addition to the facts mentioned above, I, as Ambassador, would also like to present another point of view, hoping that Your Excellency will give it equal consideration. To thoroughly understand the 1898 treaty on the Kowloon leased territory, it is necessary to recall the circumstances at the time the leased territories were established. At that time, the Chinese government, unable to reject the demands of the great powers to establish spheres of influence on the Asian continent, made only a minimum reservation. The method was to delineate a special area within each leased territory so that the local government could continue to exercise its functions. In other words, China, compelled by circumstances, only agreed to accommodate the military needs of the relevant powers without relinquishing jurisdiction over the areas. Today, Kowloon has become a vestige of an outdated system. Therefore, whenever the British government does not respect the Chinese government's minimum reservations regarding Kowloon Walled City, it is not difficult to imagine the unfortunate consequences that may occur.</p>
<p>In order to prevent the situation from deteriorating further, the Chinese government urges the British government to immediately accept the various solutions previously conveyed to Your Government by the Chinese Government through this Embassy and the British Embassy in China.</p>
<h3>Chairman Hosted Banquet for Chen Cheng Yesterday</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Office, 6th] After returning to Nanjing, Chen Cheng spent the entire day of the 6th resting quietly at his private residence on Putuo Road. Around 9:00 AM, Deputy Chief of Staff Lin Wei, Deputy Chief of Staff Fang Tian, and Sun Liren, among others, visited him. Zheng Dongguo also went to see him. Around 7:00 PM in the evening, Mr. Chen attended a dinner hosted by Chairman Chiang. However, he left at 7:30 PM. Deputy Director of the Military Medical Department, Chen Likai, was summoned to see Mr. Chen around 8:00 PM. Also, Zheng Dongguo followed Chen Cheng to Nanjing on the 5th and paid a visit to Chairman Chiang at 4:00 PM that afternoon. He is scheduled to return to his post on the 7th. [Central News Agency, Nanjing, 6th] According to concerned parties: Chen Cheng has not yet recovered from his stomach illness and is temporarily declining visitors on doctor's orders to recuperate.</p>
<h3>Handover of New and Old Hebei Provincial Governments Today in Beiping</h3>
<p>[Our Beiping Office, 6th] Chu Xichun convened a meeting of the heads of various departments and members of the Hebei Provincial Government at his residence in Beiping on the morning of the 6th. It was decided that the handover of the new and old Hebei Provincial Governments would take place at Tieshi Zi Hutong at 11:00 AM tomorrow. In principle, the Hebei Provincial Government will still be located in Baoding. However, until transportation between Beiping and Baoding is smooth, it will temporarily operate in Beiping. After taking office, Mr. Chu plans to first inspect the actual conditions in various regions as a reference for implementing policies. Mr. Chu hosted a banquet for the heads of various departments and members at 5:00 PM in the afternoon.</p>
<h3>Hankou to Organize Purchase of Finished Products, Including 17 Types of Necessities</h3>
<p>[Our Hankou Office, 6th] Director Lin Chong of the Gold Control Bureau flew back to Hankou from Nanjing yesterday. According to him, he has obtained approval from the central authorities to organize the purchase of finished products in Hankou, following the example of Tianjin and Shanghai. The scope includes 14 types of necessities such as rice, flour, cotton yarn, leather, paper, soap, and matches, as well as three types of finished products such as steel, cement, and machinery. However, the quantity purchased cannot exceed the monthly output of each manufacturer. The period for applying for purchase is set from the 7th to the 25th. After these finished products are purchased, they will be sold at flat prices in the future so that both production and consumption will benefit. The issue of industrial and commercial loans will be decided after the Lantern Festival in the lunar calendar. Furthermore, in order to completely eliminate the black market for gold banknotes, Mr. Lin has decided to reward those who provide confidential reports.</p>
<p>[Our Panyang Office, 6th] The Headquarters replied to the Tianjin Gold Control Bureau, stating that Tianjin should be responsible for the reasonable control of internal remittances for industrial and commercial loans in the Northeast. These remittances are by no means a source of speculative capital. Restricting internal remittances will affect the circulation of materials between inside and outside the customs, stimulate inflation in the Northeast, and fuel price increases, which is truly inappropriate.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Finance to First Allocate Three Months' Budget to Various Government Agencies and Units</h3>
<p>[News from Our Office] Regarding the case of adjusting the salaries of civil and military personnel, according to the provisions of the budget and the actual method of adjusting salaries, the funds to be allocated to various government agencies should be allocated before the Ministry of Finance compiles and transfers the comprehensive austerity measures such as the downsizing of organizations or the merger of institutions and the elimination of redundant personnel. For the sake of expediency, the Ministry of Finance plans to wait for the appendix to the central government's general budget for living allowances for the first half of this year to be issued to the ministry and then allocate one, two, or three months in advance according to the budget of each government agency or according to the list of applications for living allowances and in accordance with the monthly reduction standards for immediate use. After the austerity measures of various government agencies are transferred to the Ministry of Finance, adjustments will be made after recalculation.</p>
<h3>Additional Budget Approved</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Office, 6th] At the regular meeting of the State Council on the 6th, there were reports and discussions on cases such as the additional budget. The details are recorded as follows: Report section: Approved by the Executive Yuan, 13 cases of additional operating expenses for five agencies, drawing from the second reserve fund of the 36th year, including 12 cases of ordinary expenditure, totaling 1,597,797,900 yuan; one case of operating expenditure, 436,070,000 yuan; Four cases of various agencies drawing from the post-war relief fund of the 36th year, totaling 7,870,000,000 yuan. Discussion section: The Executive Yuan's affiliated agencies have supplemented the budget for operating expenses and subsidies for the first half of the 37th year, totaling four cases, which have been approved separately. One case in the ordinary section is 2.5 billion yuan, and three cases in the operating section total 210 billion yuan, all to be drawn from the second reserve fund of the 37th year. The Ministry of Finance has compiled a plan for an additional budget for subsidies to public school personnel from the central government for the 36th year, with the ordinary agency portion being over 20.121 billion yuan.</p>

<h3>Devastation on the Border of Shanxi, Shaanxi, and Suiyuan; Losses from Bandit Burning and Killing Total 400 Billion</h3>
<p>[Our Gui Sui Office, 5th] Bandit looting, arson, and killings have occurred on the border of Shanxi, Shaanxi, and Suiyuan. According to preliminary investigations, over 500 people have died, and the losses include 20,000 shi of grain, 2 million silver dollars, and other materials worth a total of 400 billion. When the Communist bandits attacked Wuziwan, all 30-plus members of the family of Han Shouxin, the regimental commander of Qi Yongquan's unit, were massacred except for Han, who escaped with his guards.</p>
<p>[Another Dispatch] On the 6th, it was reported that 1,000 Communist bandits had invaded Shili Chang in a second attack. Xi Chongquan telegraphed Qi Yongquan to send troops to search the area.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Gui Sui, 6th] Qi Yongquan's unit of the First Garrison District of the Yike Zhao League, which was pursuing bandits towards Fugu, Shaanxi, recovered the town of Hala Qiao on the border of Shanxi, Shaanxi, and Suiyuan on the 4th.

<h3>Scattered Bandits in Jingjiang County, Northern Jiangsu, Intensifying Disturbances</h3>
<p>[Our Jiangyin Office, 6th] The bandit situation in Northern Jiangsu is tense again. Xieqiao, Xilai Town, and Xingang in Jingjiang County have all been attacked fiercely. The situation in the Xieqiao and Xingang areas is currently unclear. Jingcheng is also tense, with many refugees coming south in recent days.</p>
<h3>State Council Passes Implementation Measures; Reduced Issuance of Living Allowances to Government Agencies; Ministry of Finance Simultaneously Drafts Emergency Measures for Local Finance</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Office, 6th] The implementation measures for reducing the issuance of living allowances to various government agencies have been revised and passed at the State Council meeting on the 6th. The principles and spirit are based on the principle of tightening government expenditures. The living allowances for various government agencies are calculated based on their existing number of employees plus 10% to 20% or so. This excess amount is stored on the one hand for use by various government agencies to increase personnel and at the same time used as surplus funds for the welfare of colleagues in various government agencies. Now that the salaries of civil and military personnel have been adjusted, the state treasury's expenditures are huge. In order to reduce expenditures, the excess amount will be cancelled first. Therefore, the main point of these measures is that vacancies cannot be filled, and there is no impact on the current expenditures of various government agencies. The revised text of the implementation measures is as follows: A. The issuance of living allowances to various government agencies will be reduced by a total of 10% in February and March of this year, which will be coordinated by the various competent authorities. How to handle it after April will be handled together when the second phase of living allowances is adjusted. B. Members of the Judicial, Legislative, Supervisory, and Examination Yuan, Senators of the Political Participation Council, judges, teachers, etc., are not subject to the above restrictions. C. Business agencies should strictly limit extra personnel and may not transfer business expenses to personnel expenses. D. Military administrative agencies will be handled in accordance with the first measure. E. Hereafter, various agencies may not add extra personnel.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Office, 6th] In order to reduce state treasury expenditures, the Ministry of Finance, in principle, makes each province self-sufficient, and the central government no longer subsidizes them. A total of emergency measures for local finance in the 37th year have been drafted and submitted to the Executive Yuan for review. Once approved by the Executive Yuan, they can be implemented. The main measures are recorded as follows: A. The central government will no longer subsidize the living allowances of public school personnel in various provinces and cities in the 37th year. In principle, the central government will not subsidize provinces and cities except for remote and poor provinces. The subsidies for remote and poor provinces shall not exceed the amount subsidized in the 36th year. B. The original business tax of the county will all belong to the province. The loss it suffers will be compensated by dividing the land, tobacco, and alcohol tax. The business tax of the provincial cities will be divided equally between the province and the provincial cities. C. All business tax and land tax of the Yuan-controlled cities will be included in the income of the Yuan-controlled cities. 30% of the inheritance tax will be allocated to the Yuan-controlled cities. The central government will entrust the collection of land, tobacco, and alcohol tax and allocate 50% to compensate. D. Each province and Yuan-controlled city should generally reduce 30% of the number of staff members approved by the central government in the 36th year.</p>
<h3>Sichuan Divided into Bandit Suppression Zone, Implementing Wartime System</h3>
<p>[Our Chengdu Office, 6th] The Sichuan Provincial Government has now received an order from the Executive Yuan that, in order to strengthen the suppression of chaos, Sichuan Province is specifically designated as a bandit suppression zone. The wartime system will be implemented immediately. The county governments will form combat units, and the authority of county magistrates will be increased. Military and political command will be unified in various regions.</p>
<h3>Communist Bandits Establish Ordnance Factories in Jiaodong; Most Workers are Japanese</h3>
<p>[Our Xuzhou Office, 6th] The Communist bandits in Jiaodong have been blockaded and suppressed by the National Army. Currently, external supplies have been cut off.

<h3>Luo Houfu Bandit Gang in Central Hubei Harassing Xiema River Area</h3>
<p>[Our Chongqing Office, 6th] Headquarters News: Luo Houfu's bandit gang, with over 1,000 members, has recently harassed the Xiema River area west of Maliangping on the border of Xingshan, Fangxian, and Baokang counties. This triangular area is the former nest of Li Xiannian's Communist bandits. After Li fled, he buried a large number of guns and ammunition in the Panshui River area west of Xiema River.

<h3>Jian Guansan to Propose Issuing US Dollar Bonds to Have the Wealthy Pay to Offset the Budget</h3>
<p>[United Press, Nanjing, 5th] Legislator Jian Guansan stated that he plans to submit a proposal in the Legislative Yuan to issue 500 million US dollars in forced bonds to offset the current huge budget deficit and have the wealthy pay to assist in China's reconstruction. In an interview with a United Press reporter, Mr. Jian strongly criticized the government's reliance on US aid to balance domestic expenditures. He argued that when US aid is obtained in the future, it should be used exclusively for constructive projects. Mr. Jian strongly stated that China should learn from the example of France and issue bonds. These bonds should be allocated to the wealthy and forced to purchase. Mr. Jian, who is responsible for reviewing the budget, stated that he will soon formally submit this proposal. The fiscal budget has a deficit of over 37 trillion, which is equivalent to about 300 million yuan at the current open market exchange rate for US dollars. The budget includes over 26 trillion in normal expenditures (equivalent to about 200 million US dollars) and over 96 trillion in special suppression expenditures (equivalent to about 500 million US dollars).</p>
<h3>US $510 Million Aid to China Plan Reportedly Receives Preliminary Approval; Secretary Marshall Forbids Disclosure of Aid Plan</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 6th] Government officials confirmed today that the State Department's $510 million relief bill for China is nearly complete and will soon be submitted to Congress for discussion, with the period stipulated as April 1 to the 15th month. This news was obtained from officials after the State Department restrained the Director of the News Bureau and other officials from discussing aid to China with journalists. It is also known that the National Advisory Committee approved it on Wednesday evening, despite the ineffectual efforts of several committee members to oppose it. As for the use of the $510 million, it is stipulated that approximately $470 million will be used by the National Government to purchase food and raw materials, and the remaining $30 million to $40 million will be used as loans to purchase machinery from the United States. Senior government financial experts also said that this bill may be a prelude to a long-term aid to China reconstruction plan.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 5th] A spokesman for the National Advisory Council, the US financial decision-making body, confirmed today that the State Department has prepared a $500 million aid to China plan for review by the National Advisory Council.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 5th, United Press] Secretary Marshall recently issued an order strictly prohibiting members from discussing the proposed aid to China plan.</p>
<h3>Chinese and American Representatives Agree on Methods for Handling American Relief Materials; Principles for Food Rationing in Five Major Cities Determined</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 6th] The Executive Yuan's Committee for Handling American Relief Materials held a joint meeting with American representatives Kilbright and Moore, among others, at 3:00 PM on the 6th to discuss the principles of distribution of relief materials and the detailed methods for food rationing. It was decided at the meeting that the principle of unified distribution of relief materials will still be maintained. A detailed plan for the distribution of relief food was also approved. The plan is tentatively set to be implemented in five major cities: Nanjing, Shanghai, Beiping, Tianjin, and Guangzhou. Citizens in each of these cities who are not within the scope of the government's in-kind distribution will be eligible for rationing. The rationing method will adopt a voucher purchase system, with each person eligible to receive 5 sheng per month, temporarily for a period of four months. This rationing plan will be officially announced once the wording has been sorted out. Chinese and American parties will also issue a joint statement on this.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Office, 6th] Regarding the rationing of food to the people in the five major cities of Nanjing, Shanghai, Beiping, Tianjin, and Guangzhou, the Executive Yuan previously decided to implement the principle and instructed the relevant ministries such as food, economy, and society to study the details. According to relevant parties, the entire plan has been completed and is currently being reviewed by the Executive Yuan. The relevant city governments have been telegraphed to submit citizen rosters and prepare all necessary items. It has been decided that the rationing will officially begin on March 1st. The rationing committees for each city will be established around the 20th of this month. The organization has been decided: one chairman (concurred by the mayor), one vice chairman (concurred by the director of the city's social bureau), and five groups: investigation group, storage and transportation group, distribution group, general affairs group, and audit group. City government employees will be transferred to concurrently work in each group. The materials for this rationing are allocated from American relief materials and include: rice, flour, staple food, medicines, daily necessities (kerosene, salt, sugar, etc.). Citizens with ID cards can enjoy this rationing right. Also, after the establishment of the rationing committees in the five cities, the original committees for the distribution of daily necessities to public school personnel will be abolished.</p>
<h3>Battle for Liaoyang Reaches Final Stage; Situation Tense in Yingkou and Anshan; Heavy Industrial Equipment Suffers Terrible Damage by Bandits</h3>
<p>[Our Panyang Office, 6th] The Liaoyang offensive and defensive battle has lasted five days and nights. The bandits launched a fierce attack with seven or eight divisions. The bandit artillery fire was densest on the nights of the 4th and 5th, and many of the defending troops' fortifications were destroyed. This ancient city's battle for possession has completed its final actions. It is reported that Liaoyang County Magistrate Zhou Jian has been captured by the bandits. On the morning of the 6th, the air force flew over the city of Liaoyang and saw many bandit cavalry in the city, looting past the White Pagoda. It was seen that the railway station three Chinese miles west of the city still had National Army troops holding out. The general public is now paying attention to the next action of the bandits after Liaoyang. Also, 3,000 to 4,000 bandits have fled from Tanggangzi Station to the Anshan area. Another group of bandits, numbering about 3,000, has fled from Tianzhuangtai to the outskirts of Yingkou, but has not succeeded. Also, the bandits around Jinzhou, western Liaoning, have mostly returned to the Liaozhong area southwest of Liaoning.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Panyang, 6th] The Liaoyang offensive and defensive battle unfolded fiercely in the suburbs. The battle was especially fierce in the Mazhaizi Company in the southeast of the city and the Sauce Company in the northwest. With the close cooperation of the air force, the defending troops fought valiantly and repeatedly inflicted damage on the stubborn bandits. On the evening of the 5th, the bandits concentrated artillery fire on our positions, which continued all night. The fighting was still fierce at dawn on the 6th.</p>
<p>[Our Panyang Office, 6th] The "Iron Capital" Anshan is surrounded by bandits, and the situation is quite tense. The Yingtaoyuan mining area has fallen into the hands of the bandits, and the equipment that was repaired after the takeover has been damaged again. The Shoushan water source has been destroyed by the bandits, and Anshan is lacking water and electricity. All the coal has been looted, and the food and clothing problems of the 13,000 employees are serious. Cases of freezing and starvation have been heard recently. This is the true face of the bandits' disregard for the country's military industry and shows their cruelty.</p>
<p>[Our Beiping Office, 6th] The military announced: In recent days, the Communist bandits have been systematically destroying the Beining Railway. Fan Hanjie's army group has made the necessary arrangements and can ensure traffic. The Communist bandits in Hebei attempted to attack Baoding during the Spring Festival. The National Army will take the initiative to clear them out. The Communist bandits in the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia border region claimed that they would attack Jianlin again with eight brigades. Mao Zedong convened a meeting in Fuping at the end of last month and returned to northwestern Shanxi after the meeting.</p>
<p>[Our Taiyuan Office, 6th] Peng Dehuai and He Long recently held a military conference in Xingxian and decided to gather a large army to attack Yulin again.</p>

Furthermore, the banner they presented to President Chiang Kai-shek was adorned with the four characters "Savior of the East," the one to Zhang Zhizhong was "Savior of the Northwest," and the one to Chiang's wife was "Light of Women."</p>
<p>[Another Telegram] It is learned that General Zhang Zhizhong may leave Lanzhou and fly to Dihua within a day or two.</p>
<h3>Chief of Staff of Xun Command Reports on the Actual Situation of the Dabie Mountains Campaign; Minister Bai Flew to the Capital from Hankou Yesterday</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 6th] Minister of National Defense Bai Chongxi flew back to Nanjing from Hankou at 4 PM on the 5th. He immediately met with the Chairman in the evening at 9 PM to report on the military situation of the communist bandits in Central China.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Hankou, 5th] The Jiujiang Command held its first press conference in Hankou at 3 PM on the 5th, with Chief of Staff Xu Zushi and others reporting on the actual combat situation in the Dabie Mountains area.</p>
<p>According to reports, the achievements of the two-month battle are as follows: Since its establishment two months ago, the command has directed seven major and minor battles, as well as 105 smaller engagements, resulting in 16,300 communist bandits killed, 35,100 wounded, and 6,470 captured. It also seized 3,580 rifles and over 35,000 rounds of ammunition. Among these, the victories at Liulin and Queshan were the most significant. The former initiated the anti-bandit campaign, strengthening the morale of our troops, while the latter shattered the attempted southward escape of the Chen and Liu bandit gangs, setting a record for our army's victory this year, both of which are of considerable significance.</p>
<p>Regarding the movements of the bandit army, Xu continued by saying that there are approximately 100,000 communist bandits in the Dabie Mountains area. After our army's suppression, casualties have exceeded half of that number. Currently, only the Third and Sixth Columns, as well as a portion of the First and Second Columns, remain in the area, and they are mostly scattered and fleeing. They no longer control any county-level cities. The main forces of the First and Second Columns have successively crossed the Huai River northward to the vicinity of Xincai, seemingly intending to merge their forces and attempt to replenish their ranks for another struggle. However, our pursuing troops have completed new deployments and launched an annihilation campaign between Runan and Shangcai. Liu's bandits were unable to withstand the pressure and fled north across the Hong River in a disorganized manner.</p>
<p>Future War Situation</p>
<p>Finally, Xu optimistically discussed the future war situation, stating that the guiding principle for combat in this area is to prevent the bandit army from escaping east or south, while simultaneously clearing out the remaining bandits on the ground and forcing them to return to the mountains for concentrated annihilation. This principle has been largely implemented. Furthermore, the bandit army faces difficulties in replenishment, and their morale is wavering, while our troops have high morale and are able to automatically engage the bandits in a hunting-like manner. Therefore, in the recent battle of Liutiangang (near Huangpi), our army was able to annihilate over 200 bandits with a single week's worth of troops. With the completion of planned deployments by area, the encirclement and suppression of scattered bandits, controlling key points, will surely be twice as effective and completed on schedule.</p>

<h3>Who is Attempting to Sabotage Sino-American Friendship?</h3>
<p>Thoughts on the Inaugural Speech of the U.S. Consul General in Shanghai</p>
<p>Mr. Cabot, the U.S. Consul General in Shanghai, who has not been in office for long, delivered his inaugural speech at the Rotary Club the day before yesterday. The full text of the speech has been translated and published in yesterday's edition of this newspaper. This is a rare, straightforward piece on Sino-American relations that we have had the opportunity to read in the past year!</p>
<p>In his speech, the U.S. Consul General clarified the United States' policy towards China and expressed his regret for any possible misunderstandings on the Chinese side. First, he explained that the United States does not neglect China and support Japan. Second, he explained that the United States' aid to other countries is never for selfish purposes. Third, he explained that the United States' policy is not motivated by imperialism. These are all things that we are happy to hear and deeply believe.</p>
<p>In the latter part of his speech, the U.S. Consul General expressed deep surprise that Chinese people "do not have much criticism for another foreign imperialism, which actually occupies part of China's territory and despises the Chinese government," and that they do not criticize the strong country that benefited from the Yalta Agreement through U.S. pressure at the time of the Yalta Conference. He was also surprised that Shanghai students marched and demonstrated for the Kowloon incident, which involved anti-Americanism. However, the U.S. Consul General finally observed with his wise eyes that such things occur between China and the United States because "a small group, a group of people disloyal to the country, has been found in the United States, frantically trying to overthrow our country and system. ... These lackeys of foreign despotism, of course, want to destroy the ancient friendship between China and the United States. Perhaps the cronies of this despotic country are also very busy in China." Therefore, he finally requested that "all those who believe in cooperation between free countries for the common good must always be vigilant against such slanderous rumors." The words of the U.S. Consul General can be described as to the point, much more refreshing than those decorated with diplomatic language.</p>
<p>As the Shanghai Evening Post editorial said yesterday, this speech should be read in its entirety, and every point is worth careful consideration. After reading it, in addition to sincere admiration, we would like to frankly state our feelings.</p>
<p>First, the long and deep friendship between China and the United States was built up after U.S. Secretary of State John Hay advocated the Open Door Policy, which curbed the conspiracy of the great powers to divide China at the end of the Qing Dynasty. Later, the United States first returned the Boxer Indemnity, which further enhanced the friendship. This has been a historical evolution of at least forty or fifty years. After this World War, the brave men of the two countries fought side by side. China especially received various kinds of material, spiritual, and technical assistance from the United States. As long as the Chinese people have a conscience, no one does not know that the Sino-American friendship has been solidified with blood and sweat and is more solid than before. The Chinese people, reading the books of the sages, value loyalty and forgiveness most, and hate those who are ungrateful. The United States has no territorial ambitions towards China and has always provided assistance during and after the war. How can such friendship be forgotten? Therefore, even though Marshal MacArthur has shown various forms of forgiveness to the Japanese pirates in Japan, and even though American business tycoons are advocating supporting Japan's restoration of its textile business in overseas markets, we still believe that the U.S. Consul General's clarification is genuine and sincere. However, are there any remarks in China that promote resentment towards the United States? Yes, that is only the opinion of the Chinese Communist Party and its followers. They often do this during the war, let alone after the war? They often try to take advantage of the opportunity of one or two American soldiers causing trouble after drinking to expand propaganda, as if it can form hatred between China and the United States. Such a boring act is originally not worth considering by knowledgeable people in China, but there are some American reporters who unintentionally use it, pay attention to it, and publicize it. Thus, it is transmitted to the United States, as if most Chinese people are "anti-American" there. For example, the U.S. Consul General was deeply surprised that two or three thousand students in Shanghai marched for the Kowloon incident and wrote "anti-American" slogans indiscriminately. In fact, thinking it through, it is laughable. There are no less than 100,000 students in Shanghai's universities and middle schools, and only such a small number marched, and according to eyewitnesses, only five or six people wrote slogans indiscriminately with asphalt. How can this represent the students' opinions, let alone public opinion? It must be known that this is the "masterpiece" of the CCP's deliberate attempt to destroy Sino-American friendship, and its "masterpiece" is nothing more than that!</p>
<p>Second, we not only deeply agree with the U.S. Consul General's denunciation of "this group of lackeys of foreign despotism" who want to destroy Sino-American friendship and his belief that "these cronies are also very busy in China," but also want to further inform the U.S. Consul General that the busyness of these lackeys and cronies in China may be even greater than in the United States. The American Communist Party in the United States is only using the "Trojan Horse Policy" to infiltrate various institutions and organizations to conspire to overthrow the United States' country and system, while the Chinese Communist Party has now brazenly and openly played the role of bandits in Chinese history. Not only are they very busy within China, but they are also more busy going to "this despotic country" to ask for instructions and listen to training, and busy contacting and communicating with the Communist Party of our friendly country, the United States, in order to echo each other and be loyal to their common "leader." However, we are puzzled as to why some Americans still have not figured out the true face of the CCP, and the reason is partly due to the deliberate or unintentional bewitchment of some foreign curious reporters in previous years. For example, in Yan'an, everything is clearly monotonous and there is no freedom at all, but some foreign reporters mistakenly believe that the CCP has established a free and democratic government. They do not know that in the communist bandit areas, anyone whose opinions differ from the Communist Party is called an "enemy of the people," "traitor," "KMT spy," or "fascist," and is not worthy of enjoying freedom. What a dictatorial politics this is! For example, the CCP is clearly communist, but some foreign reporters are still casually talking nonsense that the CCP is only a "land reform faction" and not a real communist party, and even covering up for them by saying that the CCP has nothing to do with that "despotic country." Things like this are endless. Sino-American friendship was originally not a problem, and the reason why it seems to be covered by a layer of shadow is mostly due to these schemers who create malicious slanders against the Chinese government and try their best to embellish and exaggerate the CCP, passing it through some foreign reporters and using their pens to add dark arrows to Sino-American friendship in an invisible way.</p>
<p>Third, we want to frankly point out that the one who is attempting to destroy Sino-American friendship is the Chinese Communist Party. However, the ones who are trying to save and strengthen Sino-American friendship in order to jointly "resist an unprecedented tyranny" should undoubtedly be the great politicians and far-sighted diplomats of China and the United States. It must be known that today's situation is already clear: this "despotic country" wants to use the Communist Parties of China and Southeast Asia to remove the power of the United States, Britain, and France in Asia. Not only that, but it has now used the concessions obtained through the Yalta Agreement to "occupy part of China's territory" in order to use China's Northeast as a stepping stone to invade the U.S. state of Alaska in the future. Mao Zedong said as early as the war in his booklet "On New Democracy": "China's revolution is part of the world proletarian revolution, and it needs the help of the Soviet Union." He also said: "Anyone who cooperates with the United States is a reactionary, and China's only international friend is the Soviet Union. Anti-Soviet and anti-communist is a traitor." Under Mao Zedong's instructions, the communist bandits have always carried out their strategy of betraying the government and opposing the United States. What a pity is that the U.S. authorities did not fully see this point at one time and forced the National Government to accommodate the CCP and participate in the coalition government. The result was naturally only failure. But even now, it still seems to be uneasy about the failure of this experiment, as if the National Government is not friendly enough, and therefore the aid to China loan is still in a vacillating state. We want to remind you: if only a portion of professional diplomats, such as Van Slyke in the past, harbor prejudices, only know how to pick bones from small eyes, and do not start from the big picture, quickly implement the United States' far-reaching aid-to-China policy, we are deeply afraid that the world situation will become more and more urgent, and time waits for no one. As for if Americans suspect why the Chinese do not have much criticism and condemnation of "another foreign imperialism," that is even more untrue. As long as you read the editorials of this newspaper, which has the longest history of seventy-five years, and the protests and demonstrations of general people's organizations against the forcible occupation of the Northeast, you will know where the true public opinion of China lies. Here, we would like to ask our American friends not to think that only newspapers that flaunt the Chinese road and call themselves democratic and free are China's public opinion! We sincerely hope that the Chinese and American authorities will jointly recognize the Communist Party's purpose of action in the entire world and deal with it in unison. Then, with mutual trust, there will naturally be mutual trust, and how can the long-standing friendship between China and the United States be destroyed by a small number of communist bandits?</p>
<h3>Flexible Measures for the Election of National Representatives in Henan Approved by the State Council; Official Announcement of the Results of the Legislative Yuan Election in Jiangsu Province</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 6th] The flexible measures for the election of national representatives in Henan Province have been approved by the State Council in the meeting on the 6th. According to the Election Committee, the election of professional and women's groups in the southern Henan Province was originally ordered to be completed in Gushi County before being compiled and announced. Only 47 counties in the province can legally hold elections. The number of votes received by the reported candidates was found to be inconsistent with the law. After separate investigations, it was found that 64 counties were unable to participate in the election. After repeated inquiries, the government replied that the remaining votes should be calculated after all counties electing according to the supplementary regulations have completed their elections, and combined with those elected according to law. Now, it is reported that the province's transportation is almost completely cut off, and it will be difficult to report the results of the county-level professional and women's group elections in the short term. The deadline for national representatives to report is approaching, and the list of national representatives needs to be determined urgently. If we wait for the province to clear out the communist bandits before all the counties electing according to the supplementary regulations have completed their elections, and combine the votes with those elected according to law, then the time may be delayed, and it will be difficult to suspend the case. In addition, the number of representatives from the province's farmers' associations, labor unions, and women's groups originally belonged to the provincial election. Now, most areas of the province have been unable to promote the election due to bandit disturbances. The 47 counties that can elect according to law do not reach two-thirds of the province's counties. It seems that the elected and candidates can be decided based on the votes of these 47 counties. The remaining 64 counties that cannot hold elections actually account for more than one-half of the entire area. Therefore, the elected representatives and candidates decided based on the election results should be re-elected after the situation in the province is calm, in accordance with Article 5 of the supplementary regulations. It has been submitted by the 19th election committee meeting of the district and reported to the national government for record.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Suzhou, 6th] The results of the Legislative Yuan elections in the three districts of Jiangsu Province have all been reported to the district election office for compilation and will be officially announced on the 7th.

Only the Legislative Yuan election ballots have been opened, with the following votes: Chen Xunxin 28 votes, Chen Bosheng 10 votes, Huang Shaogu 9 votes.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nantong, 4th] The Legislative Yuan candidates Sun Qu, Zhou Xiaobo, and Ye Xiaohou held a tea party at the New Life Club at 4 PM on the afternoon of the 2nd to receive reporters from various newspapers and report in detail on the fraud in the Legislative Yuan elections in the district.</p>

<h3>Re-election of Supervisors in Beiping City Required; Election Results in Ningxia Province, etc. Approved as Valid</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 6th] Regarding the validity of the elections of supervisors in Beiping City and the He and Er Banners and Ningxia Province, which were held in advance, a report was submitted to the State Council meeting on the 6th. According to the previous resolution of the State Council, the election period for supervisors was extended, and those who were elected without following this resolution would be deemed invalid. Now, the above three units have been elected, and regarding their validity, the Ministry of Internal Affairs believes that the advance election of the A and Er Banners and Ningxia Province does not conflict with the resolution of the State Council. Moreover, considering the transportation difficulties in the provinces and banners, and in order to avoid difficulty in convening future meetings, the elections are specially approved as valid. However, the situation in Beiping City is different and should still follow the resolution of the State Council and order a re-election.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 6th] The handling method for disputes in the election of supervisors in the first district for nationals residing abroad has been approved by the State Council on the 6th. The flexible measure is that representatives from each district vote at their respective consulates and send the votes to the Consulate General in Chicago for counting.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 6th] It was reported earlier that a British shipping company towed three barges and twelve boats on the Shanghai-Hankou line, bypassing a certain customs office and establishing a new shipping company. When inquired about this, the responsible personnel of the Ministry of Communications stated that the Ministry has not received any reports, and the name of the newly established shipping company was not specified, making further investigation difficult. Furthermore, according to Article 3, Paragraph 3, Subparagraph C of the Maritime Law, a Sino-foreign joint venture shipping company must have two-thirds or more of its directors being Chinese nationals, and two-thirds or more of its capital being owned by Chinese nationals. Its ships can be regarded as national ships with the approval of the Ministry and can sail along the coast and inland rivers. Otherwise, they are not allowed.</p>
<h3>Macao-Hong Kong Liner, New Jiangsu, Caught Fire; Passengers and Crew Rescued</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Hong Kong, 6th] According to the Fire Department here, the 1,100-ton riverboat New Jiangsu caught fire this morning while sailing from Macao to Hong Kong. The fire has not been extinguished as of this afternoon, and the entire ship is said to have been destroyed. It is also reported that the ship has run aground on Cheung Chau Island, and all 140 passengers and crew members have safely landed on Cheung Chau, but all their belongings have been lost.

<h3>Fleeting Days of the Old Year: Market Conditions in Various Regions</h3>
<p>Beijing [Our Newspaper Beijing, 6th Dispatch] With the Spring Festival approaching in Beijing, prices are soaring. Businesses unable to pay off debts are ironically saved because of the festival, while public servants and teachers are having a hard time. Although it has been decided to issue January salaries based on the cost-of-living index, the official order hasn't arrived yet, so various institutions are still selling coupons and proposing to give out a portion of the salary. The reasons for the price increases include the influence from Beijing and Shanghai, as well as the 200 billion in new currency recently transported, which is also a stimulus. With slightly looser credit, speculators are already stockpiling goods in anticipation of making profits after the festival. The Beijing Municipal Government has ordered grain merchants to remain open during the Spring Festival and not to exceed pre-festival prices. Grain merchants are therefore frantically raising prices before the festival. First-grade grain is now 1.45 million per bag, and rice is 2.65 million per 100 catties. While prices of other goods are rising, beef is uniquely cheap. Pork is 50,000 per catty, while beef is still 30,000. Meat merchants say this is still due to the war, as the cost of feed is too high, and farmers are mostly selling their oxen to butchers. Business people say that business in Beijing is generally bad, and many businesses will close after the festival. Only trading houses and grain merchants are making money.</p>
<p>Suzhou [Our Newspaper Suzhou, 6th Dispatch] Business in various industries here has been generally worse than last year. This is because prices have fluctuated greatly throughout the year, credit is tight, and interest rates are high. Many find it difficult to make ends meet as the year closes. It is reported that Hualian Chemical Materials and Dye Factory has abruptly laid off half of its workers, causing disputes.</p>
<p>Wuxi [Our Newspaper Wuxi, 6th Dispatch] During the closing period of the year, the black market for grain is rampant here, and the rate of price increases is staggering. White japonica rice has reached 1.583 million, japonica rice 682,000, and yuan rice 696,000, creating unprecedented new high prices. Wheat is 1.63 million, white wheat 1.66 million, with bran rising to 30,000. "Warship" flour is 660,000, and soybean oil is 3.51 million. However, "Double Fish" yarn is 3.57 million, a drop of 80,000. The prices of all other imported goods are rising rapidly.</p>
<p>Shenyang [Our Newspaper Shenyang, 6th Dispatch] There are recently more flights to and from Beiping. However, there are still many people flying to Beiping, and there is hope for increased air transport. Furthermore, prices are five times higher than in Shanghai and about three times higher than in Beiping and Tianjin. There is a widespread hope that the scale of remittances into the Northeast will be relaxed to reduce the extent of currency inflation in the Northeast region.</p>
<p>Hefei [Our Newspaper Hefei, 6th Dispatch] As the Lunar New Year approaches, prices are rising for all goods, especially cigarettes, which have seen the most significant price increases. Tobacco merchants are hoarding goods, hoping to make even greater profits after the New Year.</p>
<p>Xi'an [Our Newspaper Xi'an, 6th Dispatch] It is snowing again in Xi'an, and the end of the year is bleak. Many people brave the snow to buy and sell New Year's goods in the market. The entire Shaanxi Provincial Assembly Chairman, Zhu Shaozhou, is also donating twenty of his paintings of plum blossoms for a charity sale at the winter relief association, with a minimum price of 5 million per painting. The proceeds will be used as relief funds.</p>
<p>Luoyang [Our Newspaper Luoyang, 6th Dispatch] At the end of the year, the price of food in Kaifeng, Zhengzhou, and Luoyang has increased by one-third, and the price of vegetables has doubled.</p>
<p>Chongqing [Our Newspaper Chongqing, 6th Dispatch] Yarn prices are soaring, exceeding 45 million.</p>
<p>Qu County [Our Newspaper Qu County, 6th Dispatch] Heavy snow has been falling here since the afternoon of the 4th, and it hasn't stopped for a moment. The snow is a foot deep, and transportation in the city and suburbs is blocked. The prices of grain and vegetables have both increased, with white rice reaching 1.35 million per stone.</p>
<p>Wenling [Our Newspaper Wenling, 6th Dispatch] It has been raining continuously for days, and there was sleet last night. It is snowing heavily today.</p>
<p>Chengdu [Our Newspaper Chengdu, 6th Dispatch] As the Lunar New Year approaches, the weather in Chengdu is severe on the 6th, and prices are soaring. The prices of goods for the Spring Festival are rising particularly sharply. All industries are closing for the holiday from the 6th, as usual, and the atmosphere of the New Year is strong.</p>
<h3>Measures to Improve the Treatment of County-Level Civil Servants in Jiangsu Province</h3>
<p>Implemented with the Approval of the Provincial Government Committee</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Zhenjiang, 6th Dispatch] The Jiangsu Provincial Government held its 25th committee meeting on the 6th, chaired by Chairman Wang. The following resolutions were made: The new tax rates for house tax and business tax will be implemented from January 1, 1948. For those who have paid taxes according to the new tax rates before January 1, the overpaid amounts will be allowed to offset the tax payable for the next period. The measures to improve the treatment of public servants and teachers in various counties and cities were approved. Based on a base salary of 30 yuan, the cost-of-living index will be calculated. The amount exceeding 30 yuan will be paid at one-tenth of the index. The cost-of-living index for various counties and cities is set at 65,000 times. The average salary for laborers will be calculated based on 12 yuan according to the above index, and will be implemented from January 1948. The method for collecting student fees from provincial, county, and private secondary schools in Jiangsu Province for the second semester of 1947 was revised and approved.</p>
<h3>Anhui Provincial Government Layoffs: Principles Already Determined</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Hefei, 6th Dispatch] The Anhui Provincial Government has received orders to lay off one-fourth of its staff. After several committee meetings, the principles were decided yesterday: the Health Affairs Office will be cut by 60%, the Police Training School will be merged into the Provincial Training Corps, and five Commissioner's Offices will be abolished [the names of the abolished Commissioner's Offices have not been confirmed]. The various departments and offices of the Provincial Government will consider the workload and selectively lay off staff. All laid-off employees will receive one month's severance pay. If there are vacancies in government agencies, laid-off employees will be given priority for re-employment instead of hiring new personnel.</p>
<h3>Fujian Layoffs Temporarily Postponed</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Fuzhou, 6th Dispatch] Since the Central Government ordered that provincial-level expenditures be subsidized by 70%, the layoffs in Fujian have been temporarily postponed. However, public servants are still receiving salaries based on the cost-of-living index. To remedy the situation, the Fujian Provincial Government will advance the payment of salaries for February and allow each person to borrow 1 million yuan before the New Year to supplement their holiday expenses. County-level personnel will be paid at 65,000 times their current salary, taking into account the financial surplus or deficit of each locality, and will be issued at 90%, 80%, 70%, or 65%.</p>
<h3>Wang Yaowu Instructs Subordinates to Avoid Banquets and New Year Visits</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency Jinan, 6th Dispatch] Chairman Wang Yaowu recently instructed his subordinates to eliminate all unnecessary banquets and New Year visits to demonstrate thrift.</p>
<h3>Restrictions on Returning Overseas Chinese to Siam Relaxed After Negotiations</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Nanjing, 6th Dispatch] The Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission reports that after earnest negotiations, the Siamese government now considers returning overseas Chinese as returning customers and does not include them in the quota for new immigrants. A flexible approach has been announced: Overseas Chinese who left Siam before December 8, 1941, and hold a residence permit or entry permit, may return before May 1, 1948. Those who left Siam after December 8, 1941, and hold a residence permit or entry permit, must return within two years, meaning that those with residence permits or entry permits that expired within one year may return. The Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission has instructed its overseas Chinese affairs offices to inform overseas Chinese returning to Siam.</p>

<h3>First National Census</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Nanjing, 6th Dispatch] The Ministry of Interior has planned to hold the first national census in 1950. However, with the bandits not yet suppressed, there is some concern about whether it will be possible.

If the objective situation still makes it impossible, it may be postponed by one year. Many countries around the world also hold censuses in years ending in the digit zero."</p>

<h3>Ministry of Economic Affairs Formulates Implementation Measures for Seizing Materials and Stabilizing Prices</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Nanjing, 6th Dispatch] The Ministry of Economic Affairs, on the orders of the Executive Yuan, has formulated "Implementation Measures for Seizing Materials and Stabilizing Prices," which will soon be implemented. The main points of the implementation measures are as follows: Expanding the scope of supply, comprehensively planning the supply of materials, and improving the supply methods. Regarding expanding the scope of supply, in addition to public servants and teachers having the right to supply, in principle, this will be extended to civil and military personnel, employees of governments at all levels, and popular opinion institutions at all levels. If there is a surplus, this should also be supplied to cultural workers, industrial workers, vocational workers, and the general public. Regarding the comprehensive planning of the supply of materials, this can be divided into three parts: Part A, food: The government will continue to carry out grain purchase and collection, protect grain sources, increase production, and improve grain transportation methods and capacity. Part B, cotton yarn and cloth: Thoroughly implement contract spinning and weaving, unified purchase and sales. Yarn mills with more than 3,000 spindles should be responsible for contract spinning, and cloth weaving factories with more than 30 looms should be responsible for contract weaving. The processing fees for contract spinning will be calculated based on the price of cotton, and the processing fees for contract weaving will be calculated based on the price of cotton yarn. The government will increase cotton production as much as possible and remove obstacles to transportation. National accumulation and speculative hoarding will be cracked down. Part C, fuel: In addition to designating the four major coal mines of Kailuan, Huadong, Huainan, and Taiwan to supply and manage them appropriately, the government will also increase supply sources. On the one hand, it is necessary to increase transportation costs, save on usage, and avoid waste. Regarding improving the methods, attention will be paid to fulfilling registration requirements, preventing fraudulent claims, and cracking down on the hoarding of various daily necessities. As for the distribution of physical goods to public servants and teachers, in addition to the allocation of three dou of rice per month to all central government employees nationwide, as decided by the State Council, the distribution of other items such as oil, sugar, and salt will continue according to the current methods without any changes. These measures were newly formulated by the Ministry of Economic Affairs. The Executive Yuan considered the physical distribution measures previously formulated by the Ministry to be cumbersome and returned them to the Ministry for reference. The "Beijing Evening News" on the 5th reported that the Ministry of Economic Affairs had formulated new physical distribution measures. According to responsible officials of the Ministry of Economic Affairs, this may be a misrepresentation of these new "Implementation Measures." However, the "Implementation Measures for Seizing Materials and Stabilizing Prices" are only partially in principle.</p>

<h3>Unifying Economic and Administrative Affairs in West Germany: New Constitution to be Implemented on Monday, Reorganized Economic Committee with Expanded Powers, Supplemented by Legislative and Judicial Institutions, Subject to Control by the Occupying Authorities</h3>
<p>[Reuters Berlin, 6th Dispatch] The new constitution for the economic administration of the Anglo-American zone of Germany, signed yesterday in Berlin by the military governors of the Anglo-American zone, was published today. The full text is 2,000 words long and is divided into 13 articles. It stipulates that the reorganized economic administrative body of the Anglo-American merged zone will be implemented from Monday, February 9. This body will include an Economic Committee with 104 members, doubling the number of members of the existing Economic Committee; a parliament composed of two representatives from each state in the merged zone; an Administrative Committee; and several other institutions, including a Personnel Bureau, a Statistics Bureau, and a Legislative Advisory Bureau. The important Administrative Committee, which was the most criticized point of the original proposal by France and the state prime ministers to the Anglo-Americans, is listed in Article 6 of the Constitution. The Administrative Committee will have one chairman, elected by the Economic Committee, and must be approved by the parliament and the Anglo-American Control Authority. The chairman of the Administrative Committee may not be removed from office without a vote of no confidence passed by the Economic Committee and approved by the parliament and the Anglo-American Control Authority. The ministers of the Administrative Committee may not be removed from office without a vote of no confidence passed by the Economic Committee and approved by the Anglo-American Control Authority. The reorganized Economic Committee will be composed of all 52 members of the existing Economic Committee, plus 52 new members elected by the state parliaments, for a total of 104 members. The members will be allocated according to the proportion of representatives of political opinions, and each state must elect at least one person. The functions and powers of the Economic Committee include enacting and promulgating laws and regulations on the administration of railways, ports, maritime transport, inland waterway transport, interstate waterways, patent rights, customs stations, etc.; the administration of taxes and civil officials of the merged zone; and the exercise of similar powers over matters related to interstate highways, the production, distribution, collection, and storage of raw materials and food, gas, tap water, electricity, foreign and domestic trade, price controls, and subsidies that affect more than one state. The Economic Committee also has the power to decide on the priority of labor requirements. The Economic Committee may also approve the annual budget of the merged zone, with its income coming from customs duties, fees, transportation taxes, and profits from public enterprises under the control of the merged zone. Other income includes a portion of salary income tax and corporate tax, as well as funds borrowed using tax revenue as collateral. The merged zone will also establish courts, whose jurisdiction will be determined by the Economic Committee with the special permission of the Anglo-American Control Authority. Above these courts is the Merged Zone High Court established by the military government. The Economic Committee may also establish a procuratorate for these courts. When the Economic Committee is in session, it may order any member of the Administrative Committee to attend and answer questions. With the special permission of the Anglo-American Control Authority, the Economic Committee may also establish supervisory bodies to supervise the implementation of laws and regulations. The State Parliament is composed of two representatives from each state, one of whom may be concurrently the state prime minister, and their term of office is the same as that of the state government. Its functions and powers include: Drafting legislation within the powers of the Economic Committee, except for those related to tax revenue and appropriations; passing amendments or rejecting legislative bills passed by the Economic Committee that have not been previously approved by a comparative majority vote; approving the appointment of the Chairman of the Administrative Committee; and ordering the Chairman or any member of the Administrative Committee to attend and answer questions. The Chairman of the Administrative Committee has the power to guide and coordinate the exercise of their powers by the ministers and members under their jurisdiction. The Chairman or members of the Administrative Committee may propose legislative bills and issue travel regulations to the Economic Committee or Parliament. The orders issued by the Economic Committee and the Parliament have the effect of terminating the previous German Law Society, but the orders they issue must be approved by the Anglo-American Control Authority. The Constitution also stipulates that the Economic Committee and the Parliament should be established and exercise their functions and powers within 15 days after the implementation of the Constitution.</p>
<p>[Reuters London, 5th Dispatch] General Clay, Commander of the US Army, replied to the opposition of France and the Soviet Union, stating that the expansion of the Economic Committee's powers is only a temporary measure. When the British, American, and French zones are completely merged, or the four powers reach an agreement to complete the unification of East and West Germany, it should be revised.</p>
<h3>Britain and France Plan to Submit a Five-Nation Alliance Draft to the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg: This Move is the Starting Point for the Road to Pan-Europeanism</h3>
<p>[Reuters London, 5th Dispatch] Reliable sources say that after the draft proposal drafted by Britain, which will be jointly submitted by Britain and France to the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg to form a five-nation alliance, was sent to the French government for research last weekend, the French government has submitted a satisfactory reply to Britain. There are no major revisions to Britain's original proposal. The next step will be for Britain and France to jointly submit the five-nation alliance draft to the governments of the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg for research. The joint declaration issued by the foreign ministers of the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg after their meeting in Luxembourg recently expressed their acceptance of the principle of strengthening unity with Britain and France. However, they clarified that they would wait to receive its formal proposal before giving any affirmative reply. Observers believe that the acceptance of the joint proposal by the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg will depend on whether the five-nation alliance can have an effective voice in the decision-making regarding the future economy of Germany. Whether this point can be specifically stipulated in the five-nation alliance draft treaty will have to wait until the United States, Britain, and France discuss the future of West Germany in London on February 19 before a decision can be made.</p>
<p>[Reuters Brussels, 5th Dispatch] British Minister of State McNeil today informally discussed the Western European alliance proposal of Foreign Secretary Bevin with Belgian Prime Minister Spaak in Beijing.</p>
<p>[Reuters Brussels, 5th Dispatch] British Minister of State McNeil said: "If we want to establish a Western European alliance, we must not only make immediate sacrifices, but also make major political decisions. Europe seems to have taken a new decision, which not only expresses that it will never accept the dictatorial system again, but also expresses that it has taken immediate steps to cooperate to prevent the occurrence of emergency situations or the progress of any dictatorial totalitarian system. This decision does not conflict with the United Nations Charter, nor does it necessarily conflict with the non-European missions in which European countries participate. This decision is not offensive, but only defensive. The principle of European unity has been proposed, but when it is applied, it will be technically very complicated and politically very restrictive, which will not only require the participants to make immediate economic sacrifices, but will also greatly exhaust the politicians. Perhaps this move is the starting point for the road to pan-Europeanism. Under pan-Europeanism, Europe will be greater than before." McNeil also revealed that the British government has proposed inviting the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg to attend the British, American, and French summit to be held in London on February 19 to put forward their views on the future of West Germany.</p>
<h3>Three Nordic Countries Plan to Form a Neutral Group</h3>
<p>[Reuters Stockholm, 5th Dispatch] The prime ministers of Sweden, Norway, and Denmark are scheduled to meet here on Monday to discuss closer cooperation between the Scandinavian countries. One of the topics to be discussed at that time will be the possibility of the Scandinavian countries forming a "neutral group" between the Western powers and the Soviet Union. Swedish Foreign Minister Entern has informed the parliament that Sweden does not intend to participate in the Western European alliance plan proposed by Foreign Secretary Bevin. It is reported that before Entern expressed this intention to the parliament, the foreign ministers of Sweden, Norway, and Denmark had already agreed that the three countries would not participate in the Western European alliance and would only promote closer cooperation between the three countries. Observers expect this "neutral group" to be only a spiritual alliance, not a formal alliance treaty. The three countries are deeply afraid that the conclusion of a formal alliance treaty will arouse the Soviet Union's resentment, so they are unwilling to give the unity of the three countries a very formal form. So far, all attempts by the Scandinavian countries to establish closer cooperation, even customs unions, have aroused severe condemnation from Soviet newspapers, accusing them of intending to form a group hostile to the Soviet Union.</p>

<h3>The Socialist Party Recovers from the Division: The Japanese Cabinet Crisis Tends to Ease, Both Sides Agree to the New Supplementary Budget Plan</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency Tokyo, 6th Dispatch] The Japanese Socialist Democratic Party suspended its work this afternoon to curb the division. The right-wing and left-wing members of the party have agreed to another supplementary budget plan proposed by Hiroo Wada, Minister of Economic Stabilization. The plan advocates increasing tax revenue without raising railway transportation costs. However, the cabinet crisis has not been eliminated, because Wada's plan differs greatly from Finance Minister Kurisu's tax revenue estimates, so Wada's plan is expected to be opposed by the Democratic Party. The left and right wings of the Social Democratic Party have unanimously stated that if the Democratic Party disregards and accepts Wada's plan, the party will withdraw from the cabinet.</p>
<h3>The New Economic Committee in the Soviet Occupation Zone of Germany will be Located in Leipzig</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse Berlin, 6th Dispatch] Well-informed sources here said today that the new economic committee to be established by the Soviet military in Germany will be established in Leipzig rather than Berlin, so that the organization will not be affected by the institutions of the Anglo-American zone and can be more independent.

<h3>Hull's Memoirs XIII; Copyrighted by the North American Newspaper Alliance; Compiled by the Editorial Department of This Newspaper; Got Everything Without Firing a Single Bullet</h3>
<p>In August 1938, when the Czechoslovak crisis became urgent again, startling news kept pouring into my office. Urgent peace talks were mainly conducted between Britain and Germany. Walter Runciman, whom I had seen in Washington in 1937, had been sent by the British side to Prague to mediate between the Czechs and the Sudeten Nazis. At the same time, Hitler seemed to be preparing to invade Czechoslovakia.</p>
<p>Just before British Prime Minister Chamberlain left England for Germany on September 15 to hold his first personal talk with Hitler, the British Foreign Office suggested to Ambassador Kennedy that they would like the President to express an opinion on the development. At a press conference that day, I said, "The historic meeting held today by the British Prime Minister and the German Chancellor is of course being watched with the greatest interest by all countries that are deeply concerned about maintaining peace."</p>
<p>As telegrams poured into the State Department from Europe and the tension increased, I repeatedly visited the President at the White House. At the same time, I often sent Undersecretary of State Welles and Assistant Secretary of State Berle to the White House to bring information and criticism. Ambassadors Bullitt and Kennedy called me almost every day.</p>
<p>Chamberlain went to Germany again on September 22 to see Hitler. As the British and French governments were putting strong pressure on the Czech government, forcing it to make concessions to Hitler, it became increasingly clear that criticism in American newspapers believed that Czechoslovakia was being sold out to Hitler.</p>
<p>On September 24, Kennedy called me from London, explaining that a split had apparently occurred within the British cabinet. He said that Chamberlain believed that "peace must be sought at any price," while some other cabinet members said that he was unwilling to "negotiate privately with Hitler again," and believed that they "will have to fight sooner or later." He said that Colonel Lindbergh, who had been deeply impressed by Goering's air force, had been invited by the British to consult. Lindbergh had reported to us that he believed that Germany could easily cope with the combined air force strength of all other European countries.</p>
<p>On that day, Bullitt telegraphed me from Paris, believing that we should make some efforts to maintain peace, and should make some gesture even if it is unsuccessful. He suggested that the President should call on the heads of Britain, France, Italy, Germany, and Poland to send representatives to The Hague to resolve the crisis, and that we should express our willingness to send representatives to attend.</p>
<p>The next day, the 25th, our minister to Prague, Karl [he was serving as Assistant Secretary of State when I entered the State Department] telegraphed a call from President Beneš, hoping that the President would urge Britain and France not to abandon Czechoslovakia, let it be destroyed, and bring a major conflict that not only involves Czechoslovakia but also involves the world closer.</p>
<p>The President and I have been discussing what action to take. The President was prepared to make his personal appeal to the prime ministers of the European governments concerned. My thought was: Although I am not opposed to making these appeals, I do not believe that the results can prove their significance. I told the President that I felt that the evidence we had received was so numerous and fully proved that Germany had armed itself to the extreme and was determined to carry out extensive aggression at all costs, and that Hitler could not be prevented from pursuing his plan unless the other side had sufficient military force or surrendered completely. This means that any step that does not have the appropriate military force to deal with Hitler must be of an appeasement nature and purely temporary.</p>
<p>I was deeply afraid that the result of the President taking overly enthusiastic steps would put us in the same appeasement camp as Chamberlain, and would sooner or later cause the same disgrace as Chamberlain. I thought that this kind of step might mislead peaceful countries into believing that we thought there was no other possible way. Furthermore, even if this effort were successful, it would be dangerous, because at that time these countries might think that the danger of war had passed, and that the large-scale military preparations necessary to deal with the inevitable German threat were no longer urgently needed. In my opinion, given Hitler's plans and determination, the situation was truly at a critical juncture. Another danger is that the more fervent appeals made to Hitler, the more it would enhance his already extremely proud self, causing him to think that no one dared to oppose him, that he was all-powerful, and that he could obtain everything he needed step by step. In addition, I have no confidence in any of Hitler's guarantees. The idea of ​​giving Hitler a large piece of important land and obtaining a guarantee from him seemed to me to be self-deception. Welles kept urging the President to move forward, but I kept advising him to slow down.</p>
<p>But the President believed Bullitt's statement that something should be done, even if it was unsuccessful. He said to me, "It doesn't hurt. It's okay to urge peace until the last minute."</p>
<p>Since the President had decided to make his appeal, we tried to choose the most effective moment to publish them. For several days, we were preparing drafts, again and again. Welles and Berle did most of the drafting, and the President himself was quite involved.</p>
<p>On the night of September 25, we made the final touches to the President's message. We tried our best to make the message as powerful as possible within the limits of the wording. Even after the final draft was agreed upon, the President made a few slight changes with a pencil. Then, at one o'clock in the morning of September 26, the President sent the same message directly to Hitler and Beneš, and through me to Chamberlain and Daladier. We also sent it to our diplomatic missions in Warsaw and Budapest, and instructed them to forward it to the Polish and Hungarian foreign ministries. Poland and Hungary deepened the crisis by demanding certain parts of Czechoslovakia.</p>
<p>The President said, "On behalf of the 130 million people of the United States, for the sake of mankind all over the world, I most earnestly appeal to you not to let negotiations break down, but to seek a peaceful, just, and constructive solution to the current problems.</p>
<p>"I earnestly say again that as long as negotiations continue, reconciliation of views is always possible. Once negotiations break down, reason will be lost, and violence will rise." Then we waited quietly for a reply. We did not have to wait long for three of the replies. On the same day, September 26, Beneš, Daladier, and Chamberlain expressed their complete agreement with the President's views and willingness to negotiate peace. These replies were immediately announced so that the public could be informed before Hitler's scheduled speech that evening. But Hitler's reply did not come, and this reply was what we were most eagerly awaiting.</p>
<p>Europe is mobilizing. Kennedy told me by telephone from London that the British government had assured France that Britain would support it if war broke out. At the same time, Chamberlain had notified Hitler that his demands - which Chamberlain raised every time he saw him - were unacceptable, but demanded continued negotiations. I asked Kennedy if the British believed that the French were well prepared for war. Kennedy could not give me a positive answer, but he said that the British, as they had always shown, felt that they could "get up in time," that they were ordering their fleet to be on alert at all times, and that they had already called up troops from the territories.</p>
<p>Bullitt telegraphed me that Daladier said he hoped that the time would soon come when a conference could be convened to organize a true peace in Europe; he thought that the convening of this conference should be initiated by the President.</p>
<p>Now, Chamberlain wanted to make a broadcast speech to the American people on the next night, September 27, but the President said no. He thought that it might cause misunderstanding if the British Prime Minister spoke directly to the American people.</p>
<p>Hitler's reply arrived on the evening of September 26. It was a lengthy condemnation of the Czech government, the Treaty of Versailles, and the League of Nations, ultimately placing the responsibility for war and peace on Czechoslovakia, not on Germany.</p>
<p>Now we must decide what the next step should be. Bullitt telegraphed to suggest that the President should send a second telegram to Hitler, asking him to agree to send a representative to The Hague to attend a conference, as Bullitt had previously suggested. He said that Daladier expressed "joy" over this idea.</p>
<p>Many other countries have sent messages supporting the President's appeal the previous day. On the afternoon of September 27, we sent instructions to our representatives to the governments of other countries, asking these governments to issue similar appeals to Germany and Czechoslovakia. Nineteen governments, seventeen of which were in Latin America, agreed to this suggestion.</p>
<p>I also sent a telegram to Ambassador Phillips in Rome, with a confidential message from the President to Mussolini, asking Mussolini to "help continue to strive for an agreement on the current problems through negotiations or other peaceful means, without resorting to force."</p>
<p>President Roosevelt decided to make another appeal, this time solely to Hitler. This appeal, drafted by Welles, was issued on the evening of September 27, suggesting that a meeting of countries directly related to the Czech dispute be held immediately in a neutral location in Europe, and stating that "continued negotiations remain the only way to resolve the current problems on any permanent basis."</p>
<p>As we were anxiously awaiting Hitler's reply, British Ambassador Lindsay came to see me at my request after sending us a copy of Chamberlain's recent messages to Hitler and Mussolini. I said to the Ambassador, "I am asking you to come to tell you that if the war, which is already very threatening, really breaks out, I hope your government knows that my government has no policies or objectives to replace Britain's existing trade in any part of the world. Regardless of what we do in order to secure the trade of many other countries, we have no intention of taking advantage of the adverse situation created by the war for British trade and Britain's participation in the war to seize its trade." The Ambassador seemed quite moved.</p>
<p>Then, on the afternoon of September 28, as the world situation was at a critical juncture, Hitler invited Chamberlain, Daladier, and Mussolini to meet with him in Munich the next day to seek a solution to the Czech crisis. The war was at least temporarily delayed.</p>
<p>As to whether the actions taken by the President caused this result, it cannot be said. There is no doubt that they had a considerable impact. On October 20, British Ambassador Lindsay brought me a letter from King George V to the President, replying to the President's invitation to the King and Queen to visit the United States when they visited Canada in 1939. The King wrote, "I feel I must say how welcome your intervention in the recent crisis was. I have no doubt they made a great contribution to preserving peace."</p>
<p>But to me, the Munich Agreement seemed to be only a temporary solution. There are two ways to maintain peace, either to confront Hitler with strength, or to surrender. Now, the latter is being adopted. Hitler did not launch a war because he got everything he needed without firing a shot. Now, Czechoslovakia is defenseless before him. He can wait for the opportunity and get it easily, like catching a bird on a branch in a cage. Britain and France retreated before him. Prime Minister Chamberlain's devotion to peace and his great efforts and personal sacrifices to seek peace, although wrong, had some heroic qualities, but to Hitler, this was a sign of weakness. So I believe that only a "temporary peace" can result from this step, as I told the French Ambassador a month ago. Chamberlain called it "peace in our time," but this time is short.</p>
<h3>Resolutions of the Emergency General Meeting of the Entire Flour Milling Industry: 280,000 Bags of Flour to be Expedited North Before the Lunar New Year to Relieve the Food Panic in Peiping and Tientsin</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The Fourth District Flour Industry Association convened an emergency general meeting of all members at the Central Trust of China Building at 3 p.m. on the 5th. Over 40 representatives from factories in Jiangsu, Anhui, Nanjing, and Shanghai attended. Chairman Yang Guanbei reported on the situation regarding Representative Xi Debing and Ren Zhuoqun going to Nanking to negotiate the flour transfer to Japan with the Ministry of Food.</p>
<p>The factories of the Fourth District Association have been shipping flour to Peiping and Tientsin with only a reasonable profit margin, with no intention of exploiting the people of the North. Moreover, around the beginning of January, Tientsin grain merchants purchased a large quantity of low-priced flour in Shanghai, and the price of flour in Tientsin subsequently decreased. This proves that the re-export of flour not only did not contribute to rising prices but has in fact achieved the task of lowering prices. Furthermore, the Fourth District Association will take further steps to determine a reasonable price for the re-exported flour from each factory based on the market price and necessary expenses, and report it to the Ministry of Food for record-keeping, in order to help alleviate the food panic in the North.</p>
<p>In order to alleviate the food shortage in Tientsin, the Ministry of Food has approved the shipment of 500,000 bags to Peiping and Tientsin each month starting in February, with 350,000 bags to be shipped by the Fourth District Association and 150,000 bags to be shipped by factories in Wuhan. The quotas for Qingdao and Southern China will be determined separately. In the past, during peak seasons, the Ministry of Food approved the shipment of a total of only 400,000 bags to Southern and Northern China each month. Now, the amount has increased to 500,000 bags for Peiping and Tientsin alone, demonstrating the Ministry of Food's deep concern for the food situation in the North and its efforts to provide relief. However, the current period is a slow season, and the sources of supply in various regions are extremely scarce, making the increase in re-export volume practically difficult. Nevertheless, in order to uphold the intentions of the Ministry of Food and assist in alleviating the food panic in the North, the Fourth District Association will, despite the difficulties, be willing to reduce the local supply in order to ship as much as possible to Peiping and Tientsin, thereby demonstrating that the North and South are one family without any discrimination.</p>
<p>Regarding the method of increasing transportation to relieve the food shortage in Peiping and Tientsin, it was decided to expedite the loading of 280,000 bags, to be collected and shipped by Shanghai's Gongji Five Factory and factories in the interior of Jiangsu and Anhui. If the flour from the interior is difficult to transport to Shanghai in the shortest possible time due to drought, shallow water, or freezing, it has been arranged that the Ministry of Food will allocate 50,000 bags from the flour milled at the Gongji Five Factory as a temporary loan for initial shipment, to be repaid by the factories later.</p>
<p>For the flour shortfall at Shanghai's Gongji Five Factory, 50,000 bags will be allocated from the 100,000 bags of flour from Northeast China that have already been approved for shipment to Peiping and Tientsin to make up the difference.</p>
<p>Negotiations have been made to charter China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Haiyuan vessel to load 104,050 bags, and Yixiang Company's Limin vessel to load 130,000 bags. In addition, the Taihe vessel will load a certain number of bags. All ships are expected to be fully loaded and shipped to Tientsin before the Lunar New Year. It is expected that after the three ships arrive in Tientsin, the price of flour in Peiping and Tientsin will drop, and the food panic in both places can be alleviated. All members expressed their approval of this and are willing to proceed with the implementation immediately, loading the ships and transporting them to Tientsin.</p>

<h3>Restaurant Industry Requests Reduction of Banquet Tax; Council Discusses in Detail</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The banquet tax in the city was originally collected at 15%, with meals exempt. Last December, the central government promulgated revised regulations on the collection of banquet tax and entertainment tax, increasing it to 20%.

The Bureau of Social Affairs specially convened a meeting with the responsible persons of the two industries a few days ago, urging them not to act rashly and to request the Municipal Council through legal procedures. The Restaurant Association submitted a document to the Municipal Council yesterday, stating that business is sluggish, and during this period of frugality, requesting the Municipal Government to reduce the banquet tax to 10%. Daily meals, noodles, dumplings, pot stickers, and fried rice should be exempt. The main points of the request are three: [1] The ordinary banquet tax [originally 15%] should be reduced to 10%. [2] Restaurants with music facilities should also be taxed at 10%. [3] According to central laws and regulations, the starting point for taxation is one-tenth of the highest price per table, with 1.2 million yuan per table as the standard, which should be 120,000 yuan.

<h3>Students Unanimously Deny Assaulting the Mayor; Tongji Student Unrest Case Re-investigated</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The Tongji University student unrest, triggered by the issues of the student union and the expulsion of students, resulted in Mayor Wu going to mediate, but he was allegedly assaulted. The Police Bureau previously transferred the suspected students to the District Procuratorate for investigation. Yesterday, the investigation was conducted again. Due to the large number of students, 39 in total, the District Procuratorate assigned two prosecutors, Huang Daping and Gu Ruilin, to handle the case. The suspected students were detained at various police stations and temporarily brought to Shanghai for questioning. Except for Zhou Yongxin, all 38 other suspected students were brought in. Questioning began at 3 p.m. and ended at 5 p.m. The students were then returned to their respective police stations for detention. The students questioned by Prosecutor Huang Daping were Huang Kelu, Feng Liwen, Huang Renjing, Wang Zongshu, Chen Minglian, Sun Daoliang, Wang Guangquan, Xue Yukun, Fan Yufen, Liu Yipeng, and Cheng Ganting. The above were returned to detention at the Gaoshan Road Police Station.

All suspected students denied assaulting Mayor Wu. Their testimonies were almost identical, claiming that they were pushed backwards and accidentally bumped into Mayor Wu due to the police cavalry charging forward, and that they did not intentionally assault him. Due to the lack of leads from the questioning and the inability of the Sinan Road Detention Center to accommodate them, they were returned to their respective police stations for detention.</p>

<h3>Flying General's Blind Wife with One Ear Taken Away; Accusation of Seduction and Cohabitation Against a US-Bound Staff Member</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Wang Zhuo, a former senior instructor at the Air Force Officer School, recently filed a lawsuit with the District Procuratorate against Tan Yuehan, a Guangdong native sent to the United States for training by the Ministry of Economic Affairs, accusing him of disrupting his family. Yesterday, the District Procuratorate assigned Prosecutor Liang Yunshun to handle the case. The original complaint stated that the plaintiff, Wang Zhuo, and his wife, Du Qin, were married at the Shanghai YMCA on June 24, 1935. Their relationship was harmonious, and they had five children. When the Sino-Japanese War broke out, Wang served in the Air Force Pursuit Team and was wounded in an air battle over the capital. He was assigned to Kunming for medical treatment and appointed as a senior instructor at the Air Force Officer School. In July 1939, Wang was injured again in a flight accident and sent to Hong Kong for medical treatment. After recovery, he lost sight in one eye and hearing in one ear. In September 1940, due to the Japanese occupation of Hong Kong, Wang took his family by boat to Kowloon and then returned to the mainland. He met Tan Yuehan on the boat. Seeing that Wang was disabled and his wife Du Qin was young and beautiful, Tan seduced her in every possible way. After arriving in Kunming, they often visited each other, and eventually had a physical relationship. Later, Du left home without permission and hired a lawyer to publish a statement of divorce. After persuasion from Air Force Deputy Commander Wang Shuming, they reconciled. After the victory, they came to Shanghai from Chongqing to live. Du and Tan still maintained a connection. In January 1946, Du suddenly left Shanghai. Wang inquired everywhere and learned that Du had gone to Tianjin, using the alias Li Xiuhua, also known as Daisy Tan, and was cohabitating with Tan Yuehan, residing at No. 4, Building A, Fengye Building, Zhengzheng Road, First District, Tianjin. Wang tracked her down to Tianjin and investigated at the Tianjin First District Police Station, discovering that Tan had been sent to the United States for training by the Ministry of Economic Affairs in October last year and was currently residing at 2538 Mackey Road, Santa Cruz, California, USA. Recently, he even sent a letter inviting Du to the United States. Wang, therefore, accused Tan Yuehan of seducing a married person to leave their family, cohabitating and committing adultery with them, and intending to transfer the seduced person out of the territory of the Republic of China, in accordance with Article 240, Paragraph 2, Article 239, and Article 242 of the Criminal Code. The District Procuratorate will hold a hearing in the coming days.</p>

<h3>China Textile Company's Sales Decision: Two Principles - Public Bidding or Issuance of Shares</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanking, 6th] The China Textile Company will be sold publicly, but there are no preferential purchase rights. Since the promulgation of the measures for the specialized sale of state-owned production to private enterprises, the decision to include the company in the sale category has attracted considerable attention. According to sources from the State-Owned Enterprise Sales Supervision Committee, the company's sales method will be based on public bidding or the issuance of shares. The valuation of the company's assets in Shanghai has been completed and decided by the 7th Committee Meeting of the Committee to sell 16 units first. As soon as the Executive Yuan approves, a banking syndicate will be organized to publicly solicit funds. Previously, there were more than ten applications from various parties for preferential purchase, and strict review methods were established. There are only two conditions under which preferential treatment can be obtained: only those who suffered losses during the war due to supplying military needs and have concrete proof, and those who are truly local products that were forcibly purchased by the enemy and puppet regimes and can provide proof. No other excuses can be made to request preferential treatment. Moreover, the preferential treatment requested is only limited to being allowed to purchase at the same price and conditions as the public auction, and there are no special favors. Furthermore, as of now, the Committee has not approved any unit to be granted preferential purchase rights.</p>
<h3>Congestion of Goods Arriving at Fish Market; Decision Made to Suspend Auction for One Day</h3>
<p>Lianhe Fish Cargo to Be Sold on Fuxing Island</p>
<p>The Shanghai Fish Market of the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry held a joint meeting of directors yesterday at the China Trust of China Building, with Director Du Yuesheng presiding. The Market first reported that the Lunar New Year is approaching, and the arrival of fishing vessels is extremely congested, making it difficult to sell all the fish immediately. A few days ago, the Fish Management Office, China Fisheries Company, and various private fishing companies were invited to a meeting and decided to suspend the auction for one day. Director Du stated that it is necessary to maintain the consistent policy of auctioning fishing vessels in the order of their arrival at the market. If the owners voluntarily unload later, the market should be notified in writing to avoid misunderstandings from the outside world. It is also learned that the Fish Management Office's fish cargo will be sold at the original site of the market on Fuxing Island.

<h3>Russian Woman Dies Suddenly, Body Not Stiffened: Three Doctors Examine and Determine Possible in Medicine</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] Recently, a mystery of a female corpse not stiffening has been widely circulated among the White Russian community in this city. The deceased, Madame Gretny Kof, [see picture] was forty years old. Several years ago, she divorced her husband due to disagreements. She then lived at 47 Groshi Road with her nine-year-old daughter and worked as a waitress in a bar on Avenue Joffre. Due to her desolate life and arduous work, she was often unhappy. On the morning of the 2nd of this month, after returning home from the bar, she suddenly suffered an acute illness, possibly due to some stimulus.</p>
<p>She died around 10:00 AM. Her body was placed in a coffin that evening and moved to the White Russian Church on Ting Lee Road. According to White Russian custom, the deceased must be placed in the church for three days to complete religious rituals. That evening, Dr. Chai Ke Lun was called to the church to issue a death certificate. However, when examining the body, he found that the woman's</p>
<p>abdomen was warm, and her limbs could still be bent. He was greatly surprised. Upon further examination, it was confirmed that she was indeed dead. At the time, Dr. Chai Ke Lun, considering the incident bizarre, was unwilling to issue the certificate hastily. He went to examine the body again the next day, and it was already cold and stiff. However, rumors that the woman was not actually dead had already spread widely in the White Russian community. The "Russian Daily" even published an article about it. The matter was reported to the president of the Russian Emigrant Association, Polo Kof, who, to clarify the situation, instructed his secretary to dispatch three other doctors, including Dr. Ochi Wei,</p>
<p>to investigate together. After detailed examination, the three doctors confirmed that she was indeed dead. The cause of death was determined to be sudden heart failure caused by a stimulus. As for the phenomenon of her abdomen not cooling and her limbs not stiffening within a short period after death, it is medically possible and should not be considered bizarre. The woman's body was buried at Hongqiao Cemetery the day before yesterday.</p>

<h3>Private Radio Station Earns 300 Million Monthly: Messages Mostly for Gauze and Sugar Merchants, Five Suspects Ordered to Post Bail</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] The Garrison Headquarters previously discovered a private radio station at 55 Dongzha Street, Wuzhou Road. Yesterday, the suspects, Wang Zhongliang, Zhao Limin, Ma Bing, Ma Yi, Zhu Mingsheng, and five others, were sent to the District Procuratorate. After questioning by the prosecutor, it was determined that the five, including Wang, were all working at the radio station. The main culprit, Zhu Junsheng, had already fled. Wang and the others were deemed to have minor involvement and were ordered to post bail.</p>
<p>According to the investigation, Zhu Junsheng was the former director of the Shanghai Radio Station of the Ministry of Finance. Most of the staff employed were also former employees of the Shanghai Radio Station of the Ministry of Finance. The station communicated with Xingning, Guangdong, and Xiamen. The call signs for the Xingning line were both XP2, with Shanghai using a frequency of 12.6MC and Xingning using 12MC. The call signs for Xiamen were XYB and XKG for Shanghai, both using a frequency of 12MC. The station transmitted approximately 1,200 to 2,000 characters per day. The fee for transmitting to Xingning was 8,000 yuan per character, and the fee for transmitting to Xiamen was 6,000 yuan per character, resulting in a daily income of approximately 10 million yuan and a monthly income of approximately 300 million yuan.

<p>Shopping for Clothing Materials: Apprentice Deceived</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper] At approximately 1:00 PM yesterday, a young customer came to the Xinhua Woolen Shop at 512 Sichuan Road. He identified himself as Lin Yongming and selected one piece each of qipao material and trouser material, worth over 5 million yuan. He instructed the shop to deliver the materials to the Taishan Insurance Company inside the Zhejiang Xingye Building. The shop instructed apprentice Wu Yirong to make the delivery.

After returning to the shop and reporting the incident to the owner, the owner reported it to the Huangpu Police Bureau, who dispatched officers to investigate at the Taishan Insurance Company. Yang Peizhi, the person in charge, stated that there was no such person at the company.

<h3>Prohibition of Ships from Indiscriminately Sounding Whistles</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Transportation believes that small vessels indiscriminately sounding their whistles while docking in ports or navigating rivers is extremely disruptive. If not strictly prohibited, it could easily lead to misunderstandings. The whistleblowing of ships for salutes and urging passengers to board are particularly unnecessary examples that should be prohibited. Therefore, two measures for the use of ship whistles have been promulgated: (1) When a ship is moving, it shall sound one long whistle to warn other ships to give way. (2) When a ship is entering a port to dock or is raising anchor in the river, it shall sound two long whistles. All national shipping administration bureaus have been ordered to implement these measures strictly. The Shanghai Shipping Administration Bureau received this order yesterday.</p>

<h3>Woman Who Lived with a Japanese National Engaged in Repeated Litigation over House and Furniture; Administrative Court Dismisses Lawsuit</h3>
<p>A woman named Huang Lianmei rented a building at No. 8 Renjili, Fuyou Road. She lived with a Japanese national, Songze Qingxiao. The household head was listed as Huang Lianmei. After the war ended, Songze Qingxiao was arrested and transferred to the Hongkou concentration camp. Huang took the opportunity to abscond. The Shanghai Municipal Police Bureau's Yimiao Branch returned the house to the original landlord, Tong Yuezeng, for his own residence. The furniture in the house was investigated by the branch and deemed to have been left behind by the Japanese national Songze Qingxiao. The property was sealed by the Japanese Property Management Office and entrusted to the branch for safekeeping. Later, Huang claimed to have rental rights to the house and ownership of the furniture inside. Regarding the rental portion, she filed a lawsuit with the court, arguing that the Yimiao Branch's decision was illegal. Subsequently, the Supreme Court determined that, although the plaintiff had a rental relationship to the house, there was no fixed rental period specified in the lease contract. According to the then-valid Wartime Housing Lease Regulations, the original landlord was entitled to reclaim the house for his own residence with proof from the local police. The plaintiff's appeal was dismissed. Regarding the claim of ownership of the furniture, the plaintiff, during the rental lawsuit, also filed petitions with the Municipal Government and the Ministry of Land Affairs, which were both dismissed. The plaintiff then filed an administrative lawsuit with the Administrative Court. The case has been judged by the Administrative Court, which has ruled to "dismiss the plaintiff's lawsuit."</p>

<h3>Yu Tang Chun (50)</h3>
<p>Su San was tightly held by Jinglong and understood everything in her heart. She sighed slightly and said, "My heart is like a tangled mess. You should rest too." Jinglong said, "It was okay when I didn't see you, but now that I've seen you, I can't let you go." Su San wanted to take her right hand to pull away his left hand, but it was as if it were growing on his shoulder. Hearing Jinglong say this, she couldn't help but raise her eyebrows and gently scold him, "So you're saying it would have been better if I hadn't come?" Jinglong said, "It's precisely because you're so good that I can't let you go even more. Good sister, just agree to me this once." Su San couldn't resist Jinglong's entanglement and finally gave in to him once more. As the old saying goes, an ounce of gold for a moment. The value of this moment of time was truly more than an ounce of gold! Helplessly, the beautiful dream had just come true, and the song was already urging them to part. At the time of parting, there were truly countless words of gold and jade that could not be expressed. Jinglong sent her downstairs and had not yet reached the entrance of the inn when he saw Xiao Jinge leaning against the door. When they came out, he greeted them. Su San's face turned red, and she patted his shoulder and said, "Xiao Jinge, tomorrow when the young master departs, I'll still need you to take care of him. You've done so much for the two of us, and I have no way to repay you. I'll just recognize you as my younger brother." Xiao Jinge said with a bitter smile, "How can someone like me have the good fortune to have a good sister like you? Third Sister, you can rest assured and go back. Tomorrow, after I see the young master off, I will come and inform you." As he spoke, he had already reached the entrance. The rickshaw was still waiting, and the driver was dozing off in the rickshaw. Xiao Jinge woke up the driver, and Su San said, "You all go in and get some sleep tonight so you can travel tomorrow." She got into the rickshaw, waved her hand inside the beaded curtain, and the driver pushed the rickshaw from behind. For a moment, the sound of the wheels gradually disappeared into the darkness. Jinglong and Xiao Jinge sent Su San away and returned to their room upstairs. They couldn't help but prepare for a while. Last time, Jinglong had nothing but silver. This time, Su San had picked out a few shirts and pants for him to change into on the way, and there were also a few taels of loose silver that she had put in his bag.</p>

<h3>The Silver West Lake</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Hangzhou, 6th] A cold wave from Siberia struck the southeastern region of coastal areas, turning the gentle and beautiful West Lake desolate and cold. The sky helplessly produced a morning fog, thinly shrouding the bare trees and mountains. Tears turned to ice, and the surface of West Lake was almost suitable for skating. Therefore, this thin layer of mold lingered and refused to go away. On the day before the solar term Beginning of Spring, another heavy snow fell, thickly coating the scenery far and near with silver. West Lake became even more graceful and refined, winning even more elegance. In the Lakeside Park,</p>
<p>defying the wind and snow,</p>
<p>there were many people appreciating this beautiful scenery. Some were walking slowly, wearing raincoats, while others were skipping and running. Snowflakes were lingering on the long, curled hair of the girls, and boys were bringing cameras to capture various different scenes. Many male and female students were strolling along the Broken Bridge to Bai Causeway area, walking shoulder to shoulder and whispering softly. The winter plum blossoms of Lonely Hill were bravely blooming in the snow. Because of the constant stream of people going to appreciate them, Lonely Hill became unusually lively. Even more elegant people went to Zhongshan Park or the Sizhao Pavilion of the Xiling Seal Society, sipped a cup of fragrant tea, and appreciated the silver-clad scenery.</p>
<p>Concerned people were talking about how well this snow had fallen: "If it snows before the Beginning of Spring, it will surely be a year of good harvest." This year's</p>
<p>autumn harvest guarantee</p>
<p>had already shown a glimpse. People were naturally very happy, so there were many people taking flash photos and reciting poems and drinking wine. What is this? What is the difference between this and paradise? However, the domestic war and the recent continuous riots in Shanghai caused tension and frustration in the hearts of everyone in this quiet and peaceful paradise. Moreover, due to the impact of various factors, many people were poor and destitute under the pressure of severely high prices, living the life of street wanderers. Here, there was also the</p>
<p>Winter Relief</p>
<p>being launched. The government allocated 50 million yuan and also held charity sales such as movies, dramas, and calligraphy and painting exhibitions. It was said that movies and dramas could not attract much money, but calligraphy and painting exhibitions were said to have a little surplus. There were three major projects for winter relief: one was the shelter and porridge distribution center, one was small loans, and one was the donation of old clothes. There were five porridge distribution centers, and another one was to be added recently. The rice was allocated by the Tianmin Food Regulation Committee, and the porridge vegetables were donated by the Medical Vegetable Industry Association. The people in charge were local charitable people. It was said that about 6,000 people ate every day. Originally, it was intended that each Bao</p>
<p>report on the extremely poor,</p>
<p>who would then come to eat again, but later it was felt that everyone who came to eat porridge was extremely poor anyway, so it was not necessary to set up documents and to hide it from anyone. As long as they were poor, they could come and eat. The shelter was built temporarily using the accounts of the Xingzong, but as for who was eligible to live in the shelter, there was no statistics or investigation, and the shelter was built on vacant land, with only a cheap cloth awning, and no rice straw or cotton wadding. Who would want to come and suffer the cold? So the cloth awning was not hung up, but only placed in the porridge distribution center.</p>
<p>Small loans</p>
<p>were being guaranteed by the City Bank to borrow 100 million yuan from the Provincial Bank as loan funds. Each household could borrow 500,000 yuan. Each district investigated people who were capable of running a vendor stall but lacked capital, and then the city government sent staff to conduct on-site investigations before lending to them. As for whether or not they would repay, that was another matter. More than 20 households had already been loaned to. For the donation of winter clothes, 1,600 complete cotton clothes, as well as broken socks, rubber shoes, old clothes, etc., amounting to about 2,000 items, had been counted. The 1,000 cotton clothes had now been distributed, with the distribution targets also based on the Bao's investigations. Compared to Shanghai, this kind of winter relief naturally seemed much colder. Moreover, some long-term relief efforts lacked detailed investigations and did not pursue the effect of the relief, inevitably making people feel that they were being too "unconcerned with the harvest." Due to the "unconcern with the harvest" of winter relief, there were still many people in this heavy snow,</p>
<p>crying out in hunger and cold,</p>
<p>with no place to stay. There were many people with worried faces who did not know how to cope with this difficult situation. They were wandering around in the streets, but not for "enjoying the beautiful scenery," but struggling for their minimum survival. During the heavy snow, rice merchants thought of reasons to raise prices again, and the prices of goods in various stores also wanted to rise again, but other things were not as urgent as rice. The cloth shops and dry goods stores, which should have been bustling with activity, were instead deserted. Shoe stores and food stores also became desolate. Even the shops selling eggs and pork were unusually deserted because the</p>
<p>New Year's pig slaughter</p>
<p>prices were too high, causing most employers to spend effort to buy from the countryside. Only the Yan shopkeepers were beaming, not afraid that people would not come to buy his goods. This was a serious threat to the poor. In this year, there were fewer people doing good deeds. The giving of rice tickets and New Year's cake tickets was as rare as phoenix feathers and unicorn horns. So these extremely poor people could only weep in silence. At this time, in the scenic area amidst the wind and snow, which was praised as "paradise," did the people living in Hangzhou really have good fortune? No, half, or even more than half, of them were struggling and striving for their own survival! [Our Newspaper Special Correspondent Chu Yusheng]</p>

<h3>Promote Thrift and Rectify Official Behavior; Han Shixuan Punished with Salary Deduction and Major Demerit for Extravagant Banquet</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Hainan Island, 5th] Commander Han Hanying of the Pacification Command believes that decadent customs have been increasing in recent years, the virtue of thrift has been lost, the people of Ya Ya have not recovered from the war, and the rural economy has been depleted. The extravagance and licentiousness have not ceased to grow. Only by promoting thrift can good customs be established and the hearts of the people be changed. Therefore, on the day he took office, he encouraged his subordinates with the eight characters of "promote thrift and rectify official behavior," in order to establish a model and change the atmosphere. Recently, Han Shixuan, the deputy director of the Haikou Military and Police Joint Supervisory Office, held an extravagant banquet at the Funan Hotel for his young son's one-month birthday.

He ordered him to be given a major demerit and fined one-third of his monthly salary as a minor punishment.</p>
<h3>Establishment of the Peiping Art Museum – A New Peiping Opera Movement Actively Unfolds – Preparing to Perform in Shanghai This Spring</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Peiping, 3rd Dispatch] Old opera originated in Peiping. Until now, most theaters in Peiping [actually not just in Peiping] still perform old operas. However, in recent years, old opera has visibly declined. Partly, movies and spoken dramas have drawn away its patrons, but the main reason is the inherent flaws exposed in the old opera itself and the poor organization of the performers themselves. People's demands for appreciating old opera are progressing, and old opera has reached a period of necessary reform. One of the aims of the establishment of the Peiping Art Museum is to reform old opera. This new Peiping opera movement is currently developing. The Peiping Art Museum was established on New Year's Day this year. The person in charge is Jiao Juyin, formerly in charge of the drama school in Peiping. Famous playwrights such as Liu Nianqu and Zha Qianglin are participating in the work. Their scope of work is not limited to Peiping opera; spoken drama [already started], film, music, and dance [not yet started] are all to be done. Here, I only want to introduce the new Peiping opera. The Peiping Opera Troupe is personally led by the museum director, Jiao Juyin.</p>
<p>Two Countercurrents The basic actors of the Art Museum Peiping Opera Troupe are mostly former drama school students, including Wang Jinlu [male martial role], Chuan Dewei [painted face role], Gao Yuqian [female role], Li Jinhong [female martial role], Shen Jindu [male role], Yin Jinzhen [martial clown role], and Li Yiche [twenty]. Originally, there were more people, but some could not withstand the oppression of some members of the National Opera Association, leaving only these few people.</p>
<p>A week ago, the Art Museum held a new Peiping Opera symposium. The participants included drama theorists and actors, chaired by Ma Yanxiang, the editor of the "Tianqiao" section of the Xinmin Bao (New Citizen Daily). The reporter heard at this meeting that the new Peiping Opera movement is encountering two countercurrents. One is a minority of members of the National Opera Association, who believe that new Peiping opera is "clumsy and crippled national opera." They said to the actors participating in the new Peiping opera: "If you join the new Peiping opera at the Art Museum, you will never be used by any troupe in the future." However, these second- and third-rate performers, who have had enough of the "star system," feel free in this new organization. Most of them were not moved and told the society about their past pain, which had a considerable impact on the general performers. Another countercurrent is the so-called old opera "reformers." What these people do is only change the lyrics, compose new tunes, and promote the "stars." They call it "reform," but in reality, it is a restoration of the old ways. Qi Rushan is pointed out as a person in this countercurrent, and he has had heated debates with Ma Yanxiang, Jiao Juyin, and others.</p>
<p>Road to Reform According to the theory that "drama is the performance of reality," Jiao Juyin and his colleagues are engaged in the new Peiping Opera movement along the following paths: Reforming the difficult lives of the performers and creating actors who work for art. Reforming the backstage organization. The personnel system and organizational administration of old opera are entirely for money, emphasizing fame and fighting for status. It is necessary to overthrow the managing sections that collude with the "stars." Choosing scripts from a position of serving the country, society, and the people. Establishing a director system. The director must understand and be able to apply drama theory. Constant practice.</p>
<p>Three Performances The Art Museum Peiping Opera Troupe's major play is the newly staged "The Peach Blossom Fan," which has been performed twice, a total of more than thirty shows. The box office has consistently been strong, and the income has been surplus, overwhelming the old play "The Peach Blossom Fan" that was staged at the same time. Commentators generally believe that it is successful and has laid the foundation for the reform of old opera. The second performance adopted a segmented curtain system, eliminated the transitions and facial makeup, and used lighting and scenery, all of which were very advanced. As a result, the actors also fully developed their creative talents. For example, Gao Yuqian, who plays Xiangjun, was beaten three times and performed three different expressions. Zhenli, who was originally going to marry Zi Kai, also changed to Yang Longyou forcing Zhenli to marry in the middle of the performance, according to the spoken drama "The Peach Blossom Fan." There are many other changes. In short, everything is realistic and reasonable, and it will not collapse due to the threats and inducements of the old forces. Its success is predictable.

<h3>Rongs Murder Case Solved Within Six Hours</h3>
<p>Local Grassroots Organizations Discover Bandits Intermingling [Our Newspaper, Chengdu, 3rd Dispatch] A shocking bloody case occurred in Rong City on the evening of the 29th of last month. Wang Xiangqiao, a student in the Department of Rural Reconstruction at West China University and the son-in-law of Xiang Chuanyi, the speaker of the Sichuan Provincial Assembly, was riding in a rickshaw with his wife, Xiang Shufang, from the city to their private residence outside the city. Just after they had traveled half a mile outside the city, in the dark, a gunshot was suddenly heard, and Wang was killed in the rickshaw. However, his wife and the rickshaw puller did not notice until they had traveled another mile. They were immediately sent to the hospital for emergency treatment, but he died. After the incident, the Rong Garrison Command dispatched personnel to investigate in the middle of the night. According to the woman's statement, Wang had studied at the Central Military Academy, and recently a classmate from the military academy, Chuan Rongguang, had secretly told him that another classmate, Wang Hanfang, had harbored a plan to assassinate him because he had failed to borrow money from Wang Xiangqiao. The command immediately arrested all the criminals involved, Wang Hanfang, Huang Zhongchun, and Lan Xiwu, based on this clue. They all confessed without denial. The entire case was solved within just six hours. Huang and Lan are currently the heads of the Rong City Baojia (self-governance unit) and have been notorious bandits in the past, often taking advantage of their power to do evil. After the incident, public opinion in society believed that bandits were mixed in with the local grassroots personnel. No wonder it has been difficult to maintain peace for a long time. It is hoped that the government will thoroughly reorganize the Baojia personnel.</p>

<h3>Insufficient Salaries, Difficulty Raising Livestock – Living Immediately Plunged into Despair – Xiamen University Faculty and Staff Send Telegrams of Appeal</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Xiamen Dispatch] All faculty and staff of National Xiamen University recently sent telegrams to the Executive Yuan's Ministry of Education, requesting that Xiamen University be listed in the second district with a cost of living index of 115,000 times. The reason is that Xiamen is an isolated island with no local products. The food supply depends entirely on external sources, and it is also a port of entry and exit for overseas Chinese capital. The price increase has always been a leader, topping the entire Fujian Province and also higher than Guangzhou. Now the ministry's order announces the cost of living index, with Fuzhou listed in the third district, Guangzhou listed in the second district, and Xiamen unexpectedly listed in the fourth district. This is inconsistent with reality and lacks fairness. Salaries are insufficient to support families, and living is immediately plunged into despair.

<h3>Inter-City Football Tournament: Hong Kong Team Roster Determined, Inter-City Selection Not Ideal, Chinese Alliance Team Very Strong</h3>
<p>[Our Hong Kong Dispatch] The Hong Kong Football Association's Inter-City Competition Subcommittee selected the Hong Kong team representatives for the Hong Kong-Shanghai Inter-City Football Tournament on the evening of the 3rd. It was originally scheduled for three matches between Hong Kong and Shanghai: the first, Shanghai vs. Hong Kong Inter-City; the second, Shanghai vs. Hong Kong Chinese Alliance; and the third, Shanghai vs. Hong Kong Western Alliance. The Hong Kong team selections are as follows:</p>
<p>Hong Kong Inter-City Team: Tam Kwan-kan (Eastern), Go Shan-nu (Joseph), Hou Yung-sheng (Star Island), Cheung Kam-hoi (Star Island), Fa Lau (Hong Kong), Lau Chung-sheng (Star Island), Chu Wing-keung (Star Island), Keane (Yen Ping), Tang Yi-kit (Bus), Chau Man-chi (Bus), Ho Ying-fen (Star Island). (Manager) McAulay, (Captain) Go Shan-nu, (Reserves) Rickey (Hong Kong), Tse Kam-hung (Eastern), Sung Ling-sheng (Star Island), Lai Siu-wing (Star Island), Chan Tak-fai (South China), Lee Shek-yau (Bus).</p>
<p>Chinese Alliance Team:</p>
<p>Tam Kwan-kan (Eastern), Kam-hung (Eastern), Hou Yung-sheng (Star Island), Fung Kwan-shing (Bus), Sung Ling-sheng (Star Island), Lau Chung-sheng (Star Island), Lee Shek-yau (Bus), Chan Tak-fai (South China), Fung Kam-cheung (Star Island), Tse Kam-ho (Star Island).</p>
<p>(Manager) Lui Sui-hung, (Captain) Fung King-cheung, (Reserves) Tsang Kai-wing (Police), Tsang Chung (Kitchee), Cheung Kam-hoi (Star Island), Chau Man-chi (Bus), Ho Ying-fen (Star Island), Tang Yi-kit (Bus).</p>
<p>Reviewing the strength of the Hong Kong team, the Hong Kong Inter-City team's lineup is not ideal. Fa Lau's selection as center back is a surprise, and the arrangement of the forwards is particularly incomplete. There are problems with the foreign player Keane's coordination with the Chinese players. Chau Man-chi is also not an ideal right inside forward. Tang Yi-kit only has the characteristic of "fast rushes." If Meng Yiliang can mark him tightly, there will be major problems with the forward's attack. Due to the inappropriate Hong Kong lineup, the Hong Kong-Shanghai Inter-City match has become evenly matched.</p>
<p>The Chinese Alliance lineup in the second match, except for two positions, is otherwise ideal. The Shanghai team may not be able to defeat this team. In the third match, the Hong Kong Western Alliance's strength is ordinary, and the Shanghai team should be able to win here.</p>

<h3>Implementation of Supplementary Measures for Cotton Yarn Spinning: Yarn Control Committee Has Submitted to the Ministry of Economic Affairs for Approval</h3>
<p>[Our Report] The Cotton Yarn Control Committee's proposed implementation rules for contract spinning of cotton yarn have been repeatedly reviewed by the six district associations, who requested reconsideration. The committee convened a meeting with the heads of the six district associations to discuss the matter. It is now reported that the six district associations have drafted "Supplementary Measures for the Implementation of Contract Spinning of Cotton Yarn" and submitted them to the committee for approval. It is learned that the committee has submitted a formal request to the Ministry of Economic Affairs for instructions. The proposed supplementary measures are appended below:</p>
<p>The implementation rules for contract spinning of cotton yarn have been established by the committee. Because various factories have raised requests regarding the amount of cotton they can self-prepare for contract spinning of cotton yarn and the calculation of contract spinning fees, in order to show consideration, the following supplementary measures are specifically stipulated:</p>
<p>For rotation purposes in case of cotton allocation disconnection, the cotton which each factory has on hand as of the day before contract spinning begins is regarded as self-prepared cotton. If, due to disconnection, this cotton is used, the yarn spun from it will be exchanged by the committee for cotton at any time in accordance with the stipulated quantity, and contract spinning fees will be paid. If the committee has no cotton available for exchange, this cotton yarn may be transported to cotton-producing areas with the approval of the committee to purchase raw cotton for replenishment.</p>
<p>Cotton allocated by the Executive Yuan to cover the contract spinning fees that each factory should receive will be considered as each factory's self-prepared cotton.</p>
<p>Factories that export cotton yarn and cloth in exchange for foreign cotton must complete the exchange within three months within the quota stipulated by the Foreign Sales Committee. The foreign cotton obtained will be regarded as each factory's self-prepared cotton.</p>
<p>For each piece of cotton yarn spun under contract, the amount of cotton used will be 453 pounds of American cotton, in reference to the Executive Yuan's cotton allocation contract. The moisture content is 8%, and the impurity content is 0.5%. If domestic cotton is used, the amount will be increased proportionally based on the moisture and impurity content.</p>
<p>The contract spinning fees and profits that each factory should receive will be calculated using a formula developed by the Cotton Yarn Cost Review Committee, which will be organized by the committee in consultation with all relevant parties.</p>
<p>Before the above calculation formula is developed by the Cotton Yarn Cost Committee, all factors used in the calculation may refer to the cotton price and the ratio of various indices at the time of the Executive Yuan's cotton allocation contract stipulating 259.5 pounds of contract spinning cotton fees, and the percentage of contract spinning fees for 20-count cotton yarn stipulated by the Former Spinning Association in September 1947.</p>
<p>The contract spinning fees will be prepaid by the committee every ten days based on the number of contract spinning pieces in the previous month and the calculation formula, and the actual number of pieces completed that month and the difference in indices will be supplemented at the end of each month.</p>
<p>In addition to providing guarantees, contract spinning factories must also be mutually guaranteed by factories with similar spinning capacity. The dispatch of resident personnel may be temporarily delayed. If the contract spinning factories cannot fulfill their guarantee responsibilities, the committee may still dispatch resident personnel.</p>
<p>These measures will be implemented after approval by the Ministry of Economic Affairs and will be the same when amended.</p>
<h3>Cotton Yarn Registration Deadline Extended to the 14th of This Month</h3>
<p>[Our Report] The Cotton Yarn Control Committee's handling of cotton yarn registration in the city was previously scheduled from January 29th to February 6th as the registration period, and relevant trade associations were publicly notified. Recently, relevant trade associations reported that the yarn counts used by various factories are numerous and inspection takes time, so cotton yarn registration certificates cannot be completed and submitted for verification and issuance within the time limit, and requested an extension. It is understood that the committee has approved an extension of the registration period to the 14th of this month and has publicly notified all parties concerned.</p>
<h3>Cotton Yarn Weakness, Downstream in Cloth</h3>
<p>Yesterday's cotton yarn market situation saw reduced allocation prices for spun and constructed yarn and scattered selling by retail investors, with very few buyers. Asking prices weakened across the board. By the end, 42-count Blue Phoenix fine yarn fell another 1.2 million yuan compared to the previous day, to 59.1 million yuan. Other coarse and fine yarns fell in unison, ranging from 200,000 to 2 million yuan.</p>
<p>Yesterday's cloth market opened with sluggish trading, and the industry felt dull. Customers were also inactive, and prices moved downstream. As a result, 12-pound Longtou and other fine cloths fell by another 5,000 to 23,000 yuan compared to the previous day. In addition, khaki fine twill and Shilin cloth remained stable, while the rest of the cloth market was weak.</p>
<p>[Our Report] China Textile Construction Company sold yarn yesterday as usual, selling a total of 279 pieces, equivalent to 539 pieces of 20-count yarn. 104 purchase orders were submitted, and 20-count Red Bee was sold for 34.2 million yuan.</p>
<p>Spot Cotton Soars</p>
<p>Yesterday's spot cotton market soared. Off-market credit was very loose, and demand was quite strong. Industry participants held onto their goods and refused to sell, and the market supply was exhausted. The asking price for Lingbao reached 7 million, and the market atmosphere was extremely sharp. Later, as the yarn and cloth markets turned down, the trend softened slightly, and the final transaction price was 6.95 million.</p>
<h3>Purchase of Manufacturers' Finished Products: Over Thirty Cases Passed Yesterday</h3>
<p>[Our Report] At the meeting of the Executive Yuan/Administration Yuan Sub-Office held yesterday afternoon to review the government's purchase of finished products from various manufacturers, a total of forty applications were received, and approximately thirty were passed, with a total value of approximately 30 billion yuan. Today is the deadline for submitting purchase applications. Manufacturers who submit applications to the Executive Yuan/Administration Yuan treasury that day must do so before 1 PM; applications will not be accepted after that time. It is also understood that tomorrow (the 8th), although a Sunday, the Executive Yuan/Administration Yuan Sub-Office's review meeting will still be held as usual at 2 PM in the afternoon to handle unfinished cases.</p>
<h3>Rice Market Situation Chaotic</h3>
<p>[Our Report] The rice market is scheduled to close for seven days starting today, and reopen on the fifth day of the New Year (the 14th). Retail rice stores will, as usual, close on the first day of the New Year and operate for half a day from the second to the fourth day, and resume full-day operation from the fifth day. During the Lunar New Year holiday for the rice market, the Social Affairs Bureau stipulates that the retail price of rice sold by rice stores must not exceed 1.6 million yuan per shi.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the rice market situation was chaotic. Those with goods were eager to turn them into cash and sold off their stocks. Those with ample funds, on the other hand, wanted to preserve their assets and purchased from the market. As a result, the price of the same type of rice ranged from as high as 1.8 million yuan to as low as 1.4 million yuan. According to Director Wu Kaixian of the Social Affairs Bureau, the authorities have decided to sell national rice when the market reopens, for at least half a month continuously, in quantities of over 150,000 dan. The selling price has been requested from the Ministry of Food by Ye Shifu, Standing Committee Member of the People's Food Allocation Committee, who has gone to Beijing.</p>
<p>Sen Rice Rises</p>
<p>Oil Market Weak</p>
<p>Yesterday, approximately 3,300 shi of rice and grain arrived in both the northern and southern markets. The morning market continued to rise, with both japonica and indica rice adding 30,000 to 40,000 yuan. High-quality white yuan also showed firmness, while mid-quality rice was dull and lifeless. The market digestion relaxed at the close of the midday session. The authorities have decided to begin allocating rice on the first trading day of the new year. Flour rose slightly by 3,000 to 5,000 yuan, and bran rose slightly by 4,000 to 5,000 yuan. Soybeans continued to rise, ranging from 3,000 to 10,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Yellow beans rose sharply by 30,000 yuan.</p>
<p>The oil market saw abundant supply from factories, and sentiment was soft, returning downstream. Raw soybean oil fell by 40,000 to 50,000 yuan, rapeseed oil also fell by 30,000 to 50,000 yuan, while sesame oil remained firm.</p>
<h3>Sugar Rose Outside the Market</h3>
<p>The sugar market closed for seven days starting yesterday, but off-market transactions continued. Asking prices continued to rise. The spot price of combined sugar, except for mid-grade sugar, was generally weak. Bagged white refined sugar was 2.15 million yuan, and coarse sugar was 2.1 million yuan, an increase of 20,000 and 30,000 yuan, respectively, compared to the previous day. The fifth and sixth installments of mid-grade sugar stored in warehouses were 1.84 million for large bags and 1.81 million for small bags, a slight increase of 10,000 yuan. Xinghua high-grade white sugar approached the 2 million mark, and Xinghua high-grade brown sugar was 1.78 million, an increase of 60,000 and 80,000 yuan, respectively. Qing Zhuang No. 1 was 1.56 million, an increase of 40,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>Cigarettes and Soap Continued to Rise</h3>
<p>Yesterday's cigarette market saw brisk sales in stores during the Lunar New Year holiday, and buying interest prevailed in the market, intensifying the upward trend. Ten-pack British cigarettes even broke the 40 million mark per case, reaching as high as 42 million yuan. Old Knife tobacco also rose by 1.6 million yuan, and other Chinese and foreign cigarettes and 50-pack canned cigarettes all rose by amounts ranging from 1,500 to over 20,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Yesterday's daily necessities and soap market saw muted news about distribution, and sales were exceptionally brisk in local stores. Replacement demand was strong in the market, customers were actively purchasing, and large buyers were lifting prices, causing prices to soar. As a result, Gu Ben and Two Knife soaps rose sharply again by 120,000 to 130,000 yuan. Xiang Mao, Guanghua, and Beautiful soaps also rose by 50,000 and 120,000 yuan. Matches also generally rose by 200,000 to 300,000 yuan, and miscellaneous brands rose by over 500,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>Chinese Stock Market Quiet, Situation Lingering in a Weak State</h3>
<p>The Chinese stock market was forced to close for the Lunar New Year yesterday. There were large sellers off-market, and traders were delivering off-market transactions. Mid-way, the market was very weak. Small stocks showed greater stability.</p>
<p>At the opening in the morning, sentiment was weak. Off-market there were account audits, and the credit of exchanges was tight, leading to weakness. Yong Yarn opened at 720 yuan and 757 yuan. No. 71 and others were absorbed for immediate delivery, rising to 726 yuan and 762 yuan. No. 117 and others delivered for immediate delivery, and No. 45 delivered for forward delivery. Off-market interest rates opened high at 0.315 yuan and 0.36 yuan, gradually falling to 688 yuan and 730 yuan. No. 95 took advantage of the low prices to absorb spot, and prices edged up slightly. No. 220 and others still sold for immediate delivery. Off-market, a large seller successively cut more, falling to a low of 680 yuan and 726 yuan. No. 157 and others took advantage of the low prices to absorb for immediate delivery. The midday close rose slightly to 684 yuan and 727 yuan. As a result, compared to the previous close for immediate delivery stocks, Xinyi, Rong, and Meiya fell by 10%, while Yong Yarn, Zhabei, Xinho, Business, Huafeng, Matches, Yonggong, Anjingfu, Qinxing, Zhongfa, and Zhongsi fell by 5%. The rest fell slightly. For forward delivery stocks, Meiya fell by 10%, Yong Yarn and Xinho fell by 5%, and the rest fell slightly.</p>
<p>In the after-market, No. 193 and others bought for immediate delivery, Yong Yarn rose from 693 yuan and 728 yuan to 712 yuan and 736 yuan. No. 156 and others sold for immediate delivery, and prices retreated again to 693 yuan and 723 yuan. The state bank exchange difference was over 100 billion. No. 185 and others bought for immediate delivery, No. 94 bought for forward delivery, and prices rebounded to 710 yuan and 740 yuan. No. 103 and others had supplies, and the closing price was 706 yuan and 737 yuan. Small stocks such as Zhabei and Qinxing were stable and more constant. As a result, compared to the morning close, immediate delivery stocks Xinyi, Shangping, Tongyi, Xinguang, Qinxing, and Guohuo each rose by 5%, while the rise and fall of other stocks were slight. Forward delivery stocks all rose slightly. Off-market unlisted stocks also weakened due to tight credit.</p>
<h3>Unified Bonds and Foreign Stocks Weak</h3>
<p>Government bonds also weakened yesterday. Unified C bonds opened at 69,000, with a high of 71,000 and a low of 57,000. They finally struggled at the 60,000 mark, with approximately 4 million traded. As a result, compared to the previous close, A and B bonds each fell by 5,000 yuan, while C, D, and E bonds fell by 7,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Foreign stocks were sluggish and slightly weak yesterday. As the end of the year approached, trading was also very limited. Yisha only fluctuated by over 10,000 yuan, and the process was extremely mediocre. Banks sold, and securities firms bought slightly. Yisha opened at 550,000 in the morning, with a high of 565,000, and then hovered around 560,000. As a result, compared to the previous close, Steel and Telephone fell by 5%, while Yisha, British Alliance, Wheelock, Yibei, and Tram fell slightly. Paper and Cultivation remained stable.</p>

<p>Literature and History</p>
<h3>The Jin Shu in the Qun Shu Zhi Yao</h3>
<p>— Hu Shih</p>
<p>The Jin Shu was re-edited in the 20th year of the Zhenguan era. At that time, Wei Zheng had been dead for one or two years. (Wei Zheng died in the first month of the 17th year.) Wei Zheng's official title when he completed the Qun Shu Zhi Yao was "Secretary-General, Duke of Julu." He edited the Zhi Yao in the early years of the Zhenguan era, approximately between the third and sixth years. (See the records of Emperor Taizong and the biography of Wei Zheng.) However, the Zhi Yao has two volumes of Jin Shu (volumes 29 and 30). This is, of course, not the re-edited Jin Shu.</p>
<p>After looking at Huang Shi's collected editions of various Jin Shu (Hanxuetang Yishu Kao), referencing the phrase "primarily based on Zang Rongxu's Jin Shu" from the biography of Fang Xuanling, and cross-referencing it with the current Tang-edited Jin Shu, I can surmise that the Jin Shu collected in the Qun Shu Zhi Yao is Zang Rongxu's Jin Shu. (Huang Shuang also collects the Jin Shu from the Zhi Yao, but titles it "Jin Shu Recorded in the Qun Shu Zhi Yao," listed within "Various Jin History Works.") Try comparing the biography of Liu Yi (of the Western Jin) from the Jin Shu in the Zhi Yao, with the biography of Liu Yi in Zang's book collected by Huang Shi, and with the biography of Liu Yi in the current Jin Shu; then compare the biographies of Tao Kan in these three books; and you can know that what the Zhi Yao collects is Zang Rongxu's Jin Shu, and you can also know that the current Jin Shu uses the most text from Zang's book.</p>
<p>The elegance and beauty of the Jin Shu's writing largely comes from earlier works. Among them, Zang Rongxu's Jin Shu can be considered one of the most important sources. Take, for example, Huang Shi's collected six entries from Zang's book on Ruan Ji, the writing of which is completely identical to the current Jin Shu. Also, for example, the over 300 characters of Wang Zhan's biography from Zang's book cited in Huang Shuang's collected Taiping Yulan 512 are completely adopted in the current Jin Shu Wang Zhan biography. These biographies were not collected in the Zhi Yao, but they can prove that the Tang-edited Jin Shu was indeed "primarily based on Zang's book."</p>
<p>Since we have determined that the Jin Shu collected in the Zhi Yao is Zang's book, and we also know that Zang's book is the main base text for the Tang-edited Jin Shu, it can be used to collate the current Jin Shu. Scholars who have collated the Jin Shu in the past have never utilized this Zhi Yao version. I occasionally used the biography of Jiang Tong from this version to collate the biography of Jiang Tong in volume 56 of the current Jin Shu, and immediately gained insights upon opening the book, so I carefully collated it and obtained an early Tang version of the "Essay on Moving the Rong"! I will give one example: Jiang Tong's biography says that he</p>
<p>was appointed magistrate of Shanyin. At that time, Guanzhong was repeatedly disturbed by the Di and Qiang peoples. Meng Guan went west to suppress them and personally captured the Di leader Qi Wannian. Tong deeply pondered the chaos caused by the four barbarians in China and thought that it was appropriate to stop it at its source, so he wrote the "Essay on Moving the Rong" (Song version, Palace version).</p>
<p>The Jin Shu in the Zhi Yao reads "appointed magistrate of Huayin," and "personally captured" as "captured alive." This is what I call gaining insights immediately upon opening the book. That Shanyin should be Huayin has not been noticed by any of the gentlemen who have collated the Jin Shu. Yan Kejun collected the Complete Jin Writings, and he had already seen the Jin Shu in the Zhi Yao. Therefore, in his short biography of Jiang Tong, he had already changed Shanyin to Huayin. However, he did not use the Zhi Yao version to carefully collate the "Essay on Moving the Rong," only noting that this essay appears in the current Jin Shu, the Jin Shu in the Zhi Yao, the Tongdian (189), and the Yulan (794). Among these four books, the Jin Shu in the Zhi Yao is the earliest, and it still does not avoid the temple names of Emperor Taizong and Emperor Gaozong. The following examples are all valuable:</p>
<p>"Essay on Moving the Rong" (Current Jin Shu) (Jin Shu in the Zhi Yao) All have failed to guide and lead by universal transformation.</p>
<p>All have failed to transform through the Dao.</p>
<p>Guide and intermix with the Chinese people.</p>
<p>Intermix with the common people.</p>
<p>The Yi and Xia both perish.</p>
<p>The Yi and Xia both suffer.</p>
<p>The scholars and commoners are accustomed.</p>
<p>The officials and people are accustomed.</p>
<p>It is truly appropriate to pacify them with ease.</p>
<p>It is truly appropriate to pacify them with quietness and silence and then pacify them with ease.</p>
<p>With people without grain.</p>
<p>With people without husks.</p>
<p>Govern them before they become chaotic.</p>
<p>Cure them before they become chaotic.</p>
<p>Now the common people lose their jobs, and some flee and rebel. Now the Jin people lose their jobs, and some flee and rebel.</p>
<p>Most of the examples here are examples of avoidance of taboo names. However, the original text of the eighth example, "Jin people" (meaning "Chinese people"), is much clearer than "common people."</p>

<h3>On the History of Nanzhao</h3>
<p>— Xiang Da</p>
<p>A Brief Examination of Various Books on Nanzhao from the Tang Dynasty</p>
<p>(II)</p>
<p>Since Emperor Wu of the Han Dynasty established connections with the southwestern barbarians, the "Records of the Grand Historian" and the "History of the Former Han Dynasty" both have chapters on the southwestern barbarians, recording events in the southwest. Among those who wrote books specifically about the history of the southwest, such as Yunnan, was Yang Zhong of Chengdu with his "Biography of the Ai Lao." Yang Zhong's book is no longer extant, with only one passage quoted in the commentary on the "Biography of the Southwestern Barbarians" in the "History of the Later Han Dynasty," describing the eight generations of the Ai Lao Yi from Jiu Long to Hu Zhong. After Yang Zhong's book, Chang Qu of the Jin Dynasty's "Chronicles of Huayang" also briefly touched upon Yunnan. The books quoted in the "Taiping Yulan" include "Records of Yongchang" and "Biography of Yongchang Prefecture," as well as "Records of the Eight Prefectures of Southern China." The "Records of the Eight Prefectures of Southern China" is also found in the "Yiwen Leiju," and is a book from before the Tang Dynasty. Among them, Yongchang is one prefecture, and the "Leiju" and "Yulan" do not mention the other seven prefectures. However, it mentions Jiaozhi (Yulan 910) and the Qiong River (Yulan 791), indicating that the content of the "Records of the Eight Prefectures" was quite extensive. The "Records of Yongchang" mentions the King of Ai Lao (Yulan 358). The "Biography of Yongchang Prefecture" describes not only Yongchang Prefecture but also the three prefectures of Zhuti, Jianning, and Xinggu in eastern Yunnan (Yulan 791, 781, 556). These were all prefectures established from the Later Han to the Shu Han periods, and abolished after the Qi Dynasty. Therefore, the "Biography of Yongchang Prefecture" may also be a work from before the Tang Dynasty, and like the "Biography of the Ai Lao," is one of the oldest documents describing Yunnan.</p>
<p>After the Wei and Jin dynasties, the relationship between Yunnan and China gradually became estranged. In the fifth year of the Tianhe era of Emperor Wu of the Northern Zhou Dynasty (570 AD), the great general Zheng Zhuo was ordered to lead troops to pacify Yuejun, and four Ning prefectures were established in the area, corresponding to the Xichang area of present-day western Sichuan. In the seventeenth year of the Kaihuang era of Emperor Wen of the Sui Dynasty, Shi Wansui pacified the western Ning Qiang, advanced to attack the southern Ning Yi Jiao, crossed the two western rivers into Qulinchuan, and defeated more than thirty of their tribes. The two western rivers are the Erhai Lake, and Qu Wenchuan is present-day Zhancang. The Nanzhao name for Dache was also Shixian, likely related to Shi Wansui. By the Tang Dynasty, interactions with the southwest became increasingly frequent, and envoys traveled back and forth incessantly, leading to the creation of descriptive writings about the mountains and rivers. Such as Yuan Zi's "Yunnan Record," Wei Qixiu's "Yunnan Travelogue," Fan Chuo's "Manshu," Bao Pang's "Yunnan Bielu," and Xu Yunwen's "Nanzhao Lu," all based on personal observation and experience. They are first-hand materials for studying the history of Nanzhao during the Tang Dynasty today. Although the works of Yuan Zi and Wei Qixiu are no longer extant, a few fragments can be seen from the excerpts in the "Taiping Yulan" and "Zizhi Tongjian Kaoyi," allowing us to grasp their general outlines. Now, based on what is known, I will briefly examine them as follows.</p>
<p>The relationship between the Tang Dynasty and Yunnan first appeared in records during the reign of Emperor Gaozong. In the early years of the Xianheng era (around 670 AD), General Li Yi (written as Li Yizong in the "Old Book of Tang" and Li Yi in Luo Binwang's collected works) led troops to attack the Yaozhou tribes. Volume nine of Luo Binwang's collected works contains two documents from the Ministry of War announcing the defeat of the rebel Liu Nuoshe, Yang Wen, and Liu Lu in Yaozhou, and the defeat of the rebel She Mengjian, etc., in Yaozhou, which record this campaign. At the beginning of the Tianbao era, Yunnan rebelled against the Tang Dynasty and allied with Tubo, constantly harassing western Sichuan. By the beginning of the Zhenyuan era of Emperor Dezong, Yimouxun of Nanzhao, distressed by the excessive levies of Tubo, was persuaded by the Qingping official Zheng Hui to have the intention of returning to the Tang Dynasty. At that time, the military governor of western Sichuan was Wei Gao, who then sent letters to invite discussion. In the ninth year of the Zhenyuan era, western Sichuan and Nanzhao reached an agreement; in the tenth year, Nanzhao defeated Tubo at Shenchuan. In the same year, in June, Yuan Zi of the Tang Dynasty was appointed as the envoy to invest Nanzhao, and went to Yunnan. Yuan Zi's "Yunnan Record" is a record of his experiences and observations during this trip. Tang people often regarded Yuan's work as the earliest writing on Yunnan.</p>
<p>Yuan Zi, courtesy name Deshen, was a native of Langshan in Caizhou. There is a biography in volume 151 of the "New Book of Tang," and he is included in the "Biographies of Excellent Officials" in volume 185 of the "Old Book of Tang." According to the "Nanzhao Biography" in the "New Book," during the mission in the tenth year of the Zhenyuan era, Yuan Zi was the envoy holding the imperial staff to invest Nanzhao, with Pang Qi, the vice magistrate of Chengdu, Cui Zuoshi, and Liu Youyan as adjudicators, and Ju Wenzhen as the pacification envoy. Yuan Zi and his entourage entered Yunnan via the northern route. A small note under Rongzhou Kaibian in the "Geography Treatise" of the "New Book of Tang" states:</p>
<p>"From seventy miles south of the county to seventy miles. Another four hundred and eighty miles to Shimen Town, which was opened by the armies of Yi and Han prefectures in the fifth year of the Kaihuang era of the Sui Dynasty. Then through Deng Hang Mountain and Saddle Wave, two hundred and fifty miles to the Apang tribe. Then through Mount Mengkui, one hundred and ninety miles to the Akui tribe. Then one hundred and eighty miles to Yuguanchuan, then through Bowochuan, one hundred and fifty miles to the foot of Jiejingshan. Then through Jingxikou and Zichi, three hundred and twenty miles to Tangmatun. Then two hundred and fifty miles to Tuodong City. Then through Anning Well, three hundred and ninety miles to Qushui. Then through Shigugu, two hundred and twenty miles across Shimen, to Qialong Station. Then sixty miles to Yunnan City. Then eighty miles to Baiya City. Then eighty miles to Longwei City. Then forty miles to Yangjuhua City. In the tenth year of the Zhenyuan era, the court ordered Yuan Zi, a member of the Ministry of Rites, and Liu Zhenliang, an inner attendant, to travel to Nanzhao from here."</p>
<p>Liu Zhenliang was originally Ju Wenzhen, who changed his name to Liu after taking his adoptive father's surname. This is the northern route described in the "Manshu," known as the Shimen Route during the Tang Dynasty. The opening of the road by the armies of Yi and Han prefectures in the fifth year of the Kaihuang era, as mentioned in the "Geography Treatise," is also found in the "Manshu." Volume one of the "Manshu" describes the northern route in the "Record of Routes within the Yunnan Border":</p>
<p>"From Shimen Wai Chuanlu Wangkunchuan to Yunnan, it is called the Northern Route. From Qingxi Pass in Lizhou, passing through Qiongbu and Huìtong to Yunnan, it is called the Southern Route. From Rongzhou, ten days south to Shimen, there is an inscription from the early Sui Dynasty stating: 'On the twenty-fifth day of the tenth month of the fifth year of the Kaihuang era, Huang Rong, concurrently a supervisor, led the stonemasons of Yi and Han prefectures to chisel four holes in the stone, each one zhang deep, to build inclined beam gun towers, connecting Yuexi Prefecture and Jin Prefecture. This was likely the route taken by Shi Wansui during his southern expedition.' During the Tianbao era, Xianyu Zhongtong's troops entered the Naxi area via this route. Subsequently, it was closed off. Only in the past fifty years, in the tenth year of the Zhenyuan era, when Nanzhao achieved meritorious service and pledged allegiance, did the court send envoys to invest them, while the Qiongbu route was blocked by Tubo invasions. In the seventh month of that year, Wei Gao, the military governor of western Sichuan, sent the patrolling official and investigating censor Ma Yi to open the Shimen Route and establish post stations." (The quoted text from the "Manshu" is based on my annotated version of the "Manshu," with minor corrections to the Siku edition.)</p>
<p>The Shimen mentioned here is within the territory of present-day Dou Sha Guan in Yanjin County, Yunnan. On the left side of the road at Dou Sha Guan in Yanjin County, there is still a Mo Ya inscription commemorating Yuan Zi's passage through this place on his way to Yunnan, which reads:</p>
<p>"On the twentieth day of the ninth month of the tenth year of the Zhenyuan era of the Great Tang Dynasty, Ju Wenzhen, the Yunnan Xuanning Envoy and inner attendant, Liu Youyan, the adjudicator, Tutu Chengcui, the junior envoy, Yuan Zi, the Imperial Censor in charge of the Imperial Staff to invest Nanzhao, Pang Qi, the deputy envoy and Vice Magistrate of Chengdu, and Cui Zuoshi, the adjudicator and investigating censor, together received the imperial decree to go to Yunnan to invest Yimouxun, etc., as the Nanzhao. At that time, Wei Gao, the military governor, Shangshu Youpushe, Chengdu Yin, and concurrently the Censor-in-Chief, sent Ma Yi, the patrolling official and investigating censor, to lead the marching army to open the road and establish post stations. Therefore, this was inscribed on stone to record it. Inscribed by Yuan Zi." The inscription has eight lines, all in left-aligned standard script, except for the three characters "Yuan Zi," which are in seal script. Yuan Zi was a calligrapher of the Tang Dynasty, known for his seal and clerical scripts. His seal script inscription on the Tang Guang Ming stele is widely known, but his standard script is rarely seen. This inscription can correct many inaccuracies in the two "Books of Tang" and the "Manshu." Furthermore, I suspect that the so-called Shimen Route is the Five Foot Road that has connected Sichuan and Yunnan since the Qin and Han dynasties. Zhang Shoujie's "Zhengyi" commentary on the passage in the "Biographies of the Southwestern Barbarians" in the "Records of the Grand Historian" which states, "During the Qin Dynasty, Chang Er briefly opened the Five Foot Road," says:</p>
<p>"The 'Comprehensive Records of Prefectures' states that the Five Foot Road is in Lang Prefecture. Yan Shigu states that the terrain there is dangerous and narrow, so the road is only five feet wide. Ru Chun states that the road is five feet wide."</p>
<p>During the Tang Dynasty, Lang Prefecture was under the jurisdiction of the Rong Prefecture Protectorate and administered the seven counties of Wei, Tongle, Shengma, Tongqi, Xinfeng, Longti, and Quanma, corresponding to the area south of present-day Zhaotong, extending to Qujing and Luliang. Therefore, the Five Foot Road within the territory of Lang Prefecture mentioned in the "Comprehensive Records of Prefectures" is likely the Shimen Route; the Sui and Tang dynasties merely repaired it. Quan Zaizhi's collected works, volume four, contains a poem entitled "Sending Vice Minister Yuan Holding the Imperial Staff to Invest Nanzhao," which was dedicated to Yuan Zi when he was sent to Yunnan. The poem reads:</p>
<p>"The envoy star goes to the southwest, distant borders communicate tribute. Misty rains deepen the Bo road, the banner and pennant display Han ceremonies. The Five Foot precipice feels light on the journey, the waters cherish the clear dual streams. The upper kingdom bestows grace and favor, the foreign ministers follow ritual commands. The farewell hall lingers your chariot, and covers the virtue of a sage."</p>
<p>Because the Shimen Route taken by Yuan Zi and his entourage was the Five Foot Road since the Qin and Han dynasties, Quan Zaizhi's poem contains the line "The Five Foot precipice feels light on the journey." This can also serve as proof that the Shimen Route is the Five Foot Road.</p>
<p>The "Old Book of Tang, Biography of Yuan Zi" states that Yuan Zi "wrote the Yunnan Record in five volumes based on his travels." The "Art and Literature Treatise" in the "New Book of Tang" also records this book, with the same number of volumes. The "Art and Literature Treatise" in the "History of the Song Dynasty" does not record it, nor is it found in books such as the "Junzhai Dushu Zhi." The "Taiping Yulan" quotes two passages from the "Yunnan Record," which I suspect are from Wei Qixiu's "Yunnan Travelogue," as discussed below. Yuan Zi's book likely no longer existed by the Song Dynasty, so Sima Wengong did not cite it in his "Zizhi Tongjian Kaoyi." The end of volume ten of the "Yongle Encyclopedia" contains an account of Yuan Zi's investiture and the subsequent granting of the title "King of Yunnan," from Yuan Zi's departure to Tuodong to the completion of the investiture and return to Wuzhou, totaling more than a thousand characters. The writing is elegant, and the narration of events is extremely detailed. The "Nanzhao Biography" in the "New Book of Tang" also contains such a passage. This is very likely taken from Yuan Zi's "Yunnan Record"; this is the only verifiable trace of Yuan's book. Based on the "Books of Tang," "Zizhi Tongjian," "Cefu Yuangui," and the records of the "Yunshou," we can infer that Yuan Zi and his entourage were likely commissioned in the fifth month of the tenth year of the Zhenyuan era, left Chang'an in the sixth month, Ma Yi repaired the Shimen Route in the seventh month, passed Shimen on the 20th day of the ninth month, arrived at Anning City on the 15th day of the tenth month, arrived at Qu Station on the 19th day, crossed Qianshechuan on the 21st day, arrived at Yunnan City on the 23rd day, arrived at Baiya City on the 24th day, crossed Dahe City and arrived at Yangjuhua on the 26th day, and performed the investiture ceremony on the 27th day. On the 7th day of the eleventh month, the matter was completed and they returned east, departing from Yangjuhua City, arriving at Shimen on the 24th day, and arriving at Rong Prefecture ten days later, on the 4th day of the twelfth month. The round trip from Rong Prefecture took approximately three months.</p>
<p>Nanzhao rebelled against the Tang Dynasty during the Tianbao era and returned to allegiance in the tenth year of the Zhenyuan era, a period of more than forty years. Yuan Zi's mission must have caused a sensation in Chang'an at the time, and many people must have written articles and poems to celebrate his journey. However, we can only find one poem of praise in Quan Zaizhi's collection. Zaizhi also has a preface to "Sending Yuan Youji Holding the Imperial Staff to Return the Juan," which begins by saying that the chieftain of the Juan submitted to the court this spring, and then talks entirely about Dianchi and Kunming, using Tang Meng and Zhuge Wuhou as metaphors. This preface is clearly about sending Yuan Zi on his mission to Yunnan, so why are the characters "Juan" mistakenly used in the title and within the text? The reason for this is unknown.</p>
<p>Thirty years after Yuan Zi's mission to Yunnan in the tenth year of the Zhenyuan era (794 AD) and the subsequent writing of the "Yunnan Record," Wei Shenggui was sent to Yunnan in the third year of the Changqing era of Emperor Muzong (823 AD). Wei Qixiu accompanied him and wrote the "Yunnan Travelogue" in two volumes, a record of his experiences and observations during this trip. Chao Gongwu's "Junzhai Dushu Zhi," volume seven, "Pseudo-History Category," records Wei Qixiu's "Yunnan Travelogue," stating:</p>
<p>"Wei Qixiu's 'Yunnan Travelogue' in two volumes, written in the third year of the Changqing era when he accompanied Wei Shenggui on a mission to Yunnan, records the routes and distances traveled and the sights and sounds encountered. The preface states that the reason why Yunnan could be a problem for the Tang Dynasty was due to the opening of the Yi Yue books. If the area south of Qingxi Pass in Lizhou were completely abandoned, the border would be free from worry; otherwise, the troubles would be unending. When the Tang Dynasty fell, the disaster indeed originated from this. Our dynasty abandoned Qinzhou and did not defend it, and Shu had no border troubles. Based on this argument, Qixiu's words cannot be said to be false." The matter of Wei Shenggui's mission to Yunnan is not found in the two "Books of Tang," and neither Shenggui's nor Qixiu's books have been passed down. The "Genealogical Table of Prime Ministers" in the "New Book of Tang" states that Wei Shenggui, the son of Wei Dan of the Pingqi Duke branch of the Wei clan, was the prefect of Jingzhou and the sixth-generation descendant of Wei Jun. The "Yuanhe Surname Compendium" states that Shenggui was the son of Wei Jian; this is the same Shenggui who went on a mission to Yunnan. Wei Qixiu is not found in the genealogical table or the "Surname Compendium." Volume 348 of the "Taiping Guangji," under the entry for Wei Qixiu, quotes the "He Jizhi" as saying:</p>
<p>"Wei Qixiu was selected as a Jinshi, and successively held the position of Vice Director of the Ministry of Personnel. He served as the Deputy Military Commissioner of Zexi under Wang Fan and died in his official residence in Weizhou in the eighth year of the Taihe era, etc."</p>
<p>This Wei Qixiu was a contemporary of the one who went on a mission to Yunnan, so it is suspected to be the same person, but the details of his life cannot be verified. According to the "Records of Emperor Muzong" in the "Old Book of Tang," in the autumn of the third year of the Changqing era, "King Qiu Quan of Nanzhao presented gold, jade, and silk in sixteen varieties." The "Chronicle of the Tang Dynasty" in the "Zizhi Tongjian," under the entry for the autumn of the seventh month of the third year of the Changqing era, states, "Quan Li of Nanzhao urged the people of the state to request the establishment of his younger brother Zhao You." The "Kaoyi" states:</p>
<p>"The 'Veritable Records' states that on the day of Xin You in the ninth month, King Li Quan of Nanzhao presented his national credentials. At the end of the year, it was also stated that Nanzhao requested the establishment of Meng Quanli's younger brother Zhao You, claiming that 'Li Quan' was a mistake. We now follow the New Biography."</p>
<p>Qiu Quan in the "Old Book" is likely the same as Li Quan in the "Veritable Records." The "Nanzhao Biography" in the "New Book" states that Quan Longchen of Nanzhao was killed by Wang Calei, the Jiedushi of Nongdong, in the eleventh year of the Yuanhe era of Emperor Xianzong (816 AD), and his younger brother Quan Li was established. Li Xian, the junior supervisor of the Ministry of Revenue, was appointed as the envoy to invest and offer condolences; the seal was granted in the third year of the Changqing era. In this year, Quan Li died, and his younger brother Zhao You was established. King Qiu Quan or King Bao Lu Li Quan in the "Old Book" probably refers to Wang Calei, the Jiedushi of Nongdong, with Qiu Quan and Calei being different transliterations of the same name. And Wei Shenggui and Wei Qixiu's mission to Yunnan in the third year of the Changqing era was likely to bestow the Nanzhao seal.</p>
<p>Wei Qixiu's "Yunnan Travelogue" was lost after the Song Dynasty. The "Art and Literature Treatise" in the "History of the Song Dynasty" records Qixiu as Qi Mu, and Qi is also written as Ji. The "Yulan" quotes 23 passages from the "Yunnan Record," and the entries in volumes 919 on geese, 924 on rice, and 974 on sugarcane all mention Wei Qixiu. I will now transcribe them as follows:</p>
<p>"Wei Qixiu, on his mission to Yunnan, observed that outside the wall of Tuncheng, there was a large pond with willow trees drooping and providing shade, and the pond was full of geese and ducks." (919)</p>
<p>"When Wei Qixiu arrived in Yunnan on his mission, the country presented white rice, all brought live." (924)</p>
<p>"During the Tang Dynasty, when Wei Qixiu visited Yunnan, Liu Kuan, the governor of Huichuan, sent messengers to present sugarcane. The sugarcane nodes resembled bamboo, and after peeling it, it also had a sweet taste." (974)</p>
<p>(To be continued)</p>
<h3>Yin Zhu and Wang Anshi on the "Inspectorate"</h3>
<p>— Qi Xia</p>
<p>Thanks to Mr. Hu Shi's research (see the Wen Shi Zhoukan of the Dagongbao), we know that the system of "inspectorate" in the Cao Wei and Sun Wu dynasties represents the existence of "secret service organizations" as early as seventeen hundred years ago. During the Northern Song Dynasty (in the eleventh century), Yin Shilu (Zhu) and Wang Jinggong (Anshi) had already criticized this system. Yin Zhu's "Collected Works of Mr. Henan," volume eighteen, "Memorial on Important Matters of State Affairs":</p>
<p>"I humbly request that Your Majesty adopt the warning of the Han officials against prying into private matters and learn from the drawbacks of the Wu ruler's 'inspectorate'..."</p>
<p>Also, volume two of the same book, "Rectifying Inquiries":</p>
<p>"Those who govern the country in previous generations either liked to hear about external affairs or considered inquiry as a sign of intelligence. Some reported on matters of the neighborhood, which were praised for their openness and considered exhaustive; however, there was nothing more harmful than those who slandered virtuous officials. Therefore, the disaster of the 'hook party' originated from those nearby, and the prison sentences based on informing originated from widespread listening."</p>
<p>Although this passage does not mention the inspectorate, the people who "slandered virtuous officials" refer to the inspectors. Later, Wang Jinggong also discussed this matter, and his argument was clearer than Yin Zhu's. "Zizhi Tongjian Changbian," volume 240:</p>
<p>"On the day of Wu Chen in the eleventh month of the fifth year of the Xining era,... Feng Jing said, 'The Fucheng Division has recently dispatched many investigators, and the people are quite uneasy.' The Emperor (Shenzong) said, 'The number of people is still the same as before, and the investigation is not excessive. Lan Yuanzhen is also cautious... These people were originally ordered to specifically investigate military matters. If the military strictly enforces the law of reporting and arresting, it can also prevent mutiny.' (Wang) Anshi said, 'It is not a problem to specifically order them to investigate military matters. However, if relying on these people to investigate external affairs, they may not avoid making mistakes. Sun Quan and Cao Cao used extremely strict laws, executing people at every turn. However, even when using the likes of Zhao Kui (should be Zhao Da)' and Lu Yi, they could still commit treachery and disrupt the government. Your Majesty is benevolent and does not bear to execute people, so how can you guarantee that these people will not commit treachery? Not to mention the sage kings of the Three Dynasties, even Emperor Gaozu of Han and Emperor Taizong of Tang did not do what Sun Quan and Cao Cao did. But clearly showing likes and dislikes, rewards and punishments, so that officials are loyal and trustworthy, and dare not lie or deceive, how can the affairs of the world be concealed and not heard? If trivial matters are not heard, what harm is there to the governance of the state? If you want to hear trivial matters, but instead lead these people to commit treachery, then the damage to the governance of the state is not small.' The Emperor agreed."</p>
<p>From the above quote, Jinggong clearly stated the nature and drawbacks of this system. He pointed out that Zhao Da and Lu Yi were precisely the "inspectorate system" of Wei and Wu.</p>

<p>Free Talk</p>
<h3>On Freedom of Thought</h3>
<p>— Xuanxuan</p>
<p>The other day, I read an article by Jingwen Jun in this column, paying respects to Varga, the sanctioned Soviet economic authority. The article implied that Varga was able to be loyal to his views and unwilling to change his conclusion about the trends of capitalism due to political or other reasons.</p>
<p>The matter of Varga's sanctioning was first seen in "The New York Times" more than a week ago. The Soviet side has not yet denied it. Judging from the status of "The New York Times" in the press, the credibility of this matter seems undoubtable.</p>
<p>Given Varga's high reputation in Soviet economics circles, it is surprising that he has been sanctioned in this wave of purging Western thought. Especially in a country like the Soviet Union, given how much the Soviet authorities relied on Varga (who served as Stalin's economic advisor during the war), it is significant that he disregarded the interference of his superiors and insisted on his conclusion that capitalism would not experience a recession within ten years. Freedom of thought is unstoppable, whether in an environment of free thought or in an environment where thought is not free.</p>
<p>Here, we might as well cite another example to look at the attitudes of two kinds of thinkers.</p>
<p>Last September, there was also an academic debate in the Soviet Union (Varga's purge was probably carried out in this way). The convener was Zhdanov, a member of the Politburo, and the theme of the debate was Alexandrov's best-selling book "History of Western European Philosophy." Attending were a number of prominent figures in Soviet philosophy. What is strange is that Alexandrov was not an unknown figure. He was a member of the Central Executive Committee of the CPSU, had won the Stalin Prize, and was a first-class Soviet theorist. His "History of Western European Philosophy" became a problem because it praised the status of Western philosophy.</p>
<p>In this debate, however, Alexandrov did not act like Varga. He completely "admitted" his mistakes and was willing to "voluntarily" revise his theory, and so the storm subsided.</p>
<p>Here, we can see two kinds of attitudes of thinkers. One is persistent and loyal to his own theory, whose spirit of martyrdom is like that of the ancient Indian monks, and is naturally worthy of admiration. The other is submissive and compromises with politics, whose status is of course very different from the former. But here, I have a personal opinion: rather than blaming the fact that academia submits to politics, it is better to blame the system in which politics compromises academia. Alexandrov is indeed weak, but his fault lies only in his weakness, and the responsibility for harming academia must be borne by the environment that makes it weak.</p>
<p>People often blame the victims, while easily letting go of those who harm others. After the Munich crisis, the deceived Chamberlain was scolded more than the deceitful Hitler, which is really not fair. The vision of the common world often loses its sense of proportion and ultimately ignores the fundamentals of things.</p>
<p>Varga is certainly commendable, and Alexandrov is not without fault. For "History of Western European Philosophy," we can still respect its original state before it was "revised," but for the kind of atmosphere in which thought cannot be free, we really have to criticize it.</p>
<h3>Tojo's Secret</h3>
<p>Here is a secret about Hideki Tojo, which perhaps Tojo himself does not know.</p>
<p>After the attack on Pearl Harbor, the United States was united in outrage. From then on, the most popular slogan was "Remember Pearl Harbor." Of course, the American soldiers who experienced the war were always mindful of it.</p>
<p>And now, Hideki Tojo has truly achieved the degree of "never forgetting until death."</p>
<p>The fact is this: One day, the US military authorities stationed in Japan suddenly summoned three young US Navy officers. These three people were all licensed dentists before joining the army. After these three officers reported for duty, the commander gave them the order: to go to Sugamo Prison to see a war criminal for dental problems.</p>
<p>When they arrived at the prison, they learned that their patient was none other than Hideki Tojo, the leader of the Sugamo Prison inmates - Tojo's dentures were broken, and he asked them to make him a new set of dentures.</p>
<p>These three officers, who could not forget Pearl Harbor, had an idea. A few days later, they sent the new dentures to the prison, and Tojo seemed very satisfied.</p>
<p>But he did not know that there was a neat row of small dimples on top of those dentures—if read according to telegraph code, it would be exactly one sentence: "Remember Pearl Harbor"! (Ruyi)</p>
<h3>A Democratic School</h3>
<p>— Ze Shi</p>
<p>A month ago, when the cries for democracy were shaking the heavens and earth, as far as I know, there is one thing that best exemplifies democracy, and that is schools. The fact is, as reported in a news item from this city (Shanghai):</p>
<p>The Municipal Education Bureau announced that the city's national primary schools have not yet reached the standard of one school per district, and many school-age children wishing to enroll cannot all be accommodated. Therefore, the work plan for the 36th year of the Republic (1947) will continue to focus on establishing more national primary schools and classes, accommodating as many school-age children as possible, and encouraging private schooling. After a year of effort, the expansion of national primary schools has been limited by funding, failing to meet the expected target, while the number of private primary schools has increased considerably. This year, 38 national primary schools were added, enrolling an additional 22,718 students, and 330 private schools were added, enrolling an additional 53,000-plus students. In total, the city now has 321 municipal primary schools with 161,596 students, and 1,162 private primary schools with 232,014 students.</p>
<p>From this, we can see that private primary schools enroll about 50% more students than municipal schools. If the government continues to "be limited by funding" and continues to "encourage private schooling," in the near future, municipal primary schools will become as rare as phoenix feathers and unicorn horns, while private schools will spring up like bamboo shoots after a rain. According to the old saying, primary education is compulsory education, meaning the government establishes schools extensively and forces school-age children to enroll. Now we have changed to "voluntary enrollment," which is democratic wind number one. The government humbly admits to being limited by funding and encourages private schooling, which is democratic wind number two. This little bit of democracy is particularly valuable because, according to a certain British educator (unfortunately, not a Yan country one!), the most democratic education is to take education out of the hands of the state, because the state often uses education as a tool to achieve certain goals, just like the church in the old days.</p>
<p>However, people sometimes have rather strange temperaments. For example, regarding democracy, some places strive for democracy even at the cost of bloodshed, while other places strongly reject democracy, and if they cannot refuse it, they will cause a public outcry. The democratization of schools mentioned above, if public opinion could be widely solicited, the result would certainly not be in favor of it. The reason is not difficult to understand: municipal schools have low tuition fees, while private schools have high tuition fees, and nine out of ten people prefer the cheaper option because they are poor. From this point of view, the more private schools there are, the fewer children will be able to attend. Therefore, it is said that the democratic wind in schools (especially primary schools) should not be encouraged.</p>
<p>I do not want to blame the wise: the government always finds ways to fund other expenses, such as gasoline costs, tea and refreshments, and the cost of repairing doors, windows, and tables damaged by dancing girls, but why is it that only funding for primary education is always "limited"? I only want to suggest: instead of encouraging private schooling, it is better to move towards joint public-private management. If funding is "limited," taxes can be set up to make it not "limited." I do not know why private school tuition is expensive, and I do not know why public school tuition is cheap. But I know that one is expensive and one is cheap. Since fully public schools are limited by funding, cooperation with private schools should be a last resort. Suppose a public primary school loses 100 yuan per year, while a private primary school must profit 20 yuan per year. Then the government can say to the private school, "Your 20 yuan profit will be paid by us, and you are not allowed to get it from the students." The private school, losing the income from students but gaining it from the government, should gladly comply, and the tuition fee can be reduced considerably. For the government, the cost of one school can help five schools, so why not do it? Otherwise, no matter how hard you try to encourage private schooling, if the private schools are not interested in education, the result will be either unreasonably high tuition fees, or students, even if they want to enroll, will be limited by the school gate opening wide with the words "Those who have ambition but no money, do not enter," and their aspirations will be completely dashed.</p>
<p>As for the money the government subsidizes private schools, there are many ways to generate revenue. For example, if dancing is not banned, a education tax of 10,000, 100,000, or even a million yuan could be added to each dance ticket, and the income would certainly be considerable. Using this to fund education would not be a problem, and if it had been thought of earlier, the tens of billions spent on repairing the doors, windows, and tables of the Social Affairs Bureau could have been transferred to education funding, and several more national primary schools could have been established. If dancing must be banned, then before the movie theaters close, a certain amount of education tax could be levied on each movie ticket, which would undoubtedly be a very large sum.</p>
<p>If the education authorities are truly dedicated to education, then this year they should focus on my method. The result will certainly be good, and I will not take credit for it.</p>
<h3>Happy Wanderings</h3>
<p>— Chen Shenyan</p>
<h3>Chapter 10: Voluntary Sacrifice (65)</h3>
<p>Qi Wan did not know what Yu Ru intended. Her starry eyes remained fixed on the old man's face. Yu Ru continued, "It's a pity you met too late. Zhu Zhai is already married. If I had known, I would have certainly..." Saying this, he shook his head repeatedly, expressing regret. Seeing the old man express himself in this way, Qi Wan was taken by surprise and stared blankly. Then, she heard Yu Ru say, "You are a good child. You are sensible and know etiquette. We old families should strive to maintain the old moral concepts. You must be able to help me. I have come to you today specifically to ask you for a favor. An old man in his sixties has come to your door to ask for a favor. You should be able to imagine how important this matter is to my entire family." Seeing Yu Ru speak so solemnly, Qi Wan knew that something might have changed. She raised her eyelids and glanced at Yu Ru, asking, "Sir, what is it? Please speak frankly. I am not a confused person. Everything should be done according to reason." Yu Ru nodded his head, saying, "I think you will understand me. Zhu Zhai is my only son. My old couple is over 130 years old combined, and we only have this one son. Since he got married, our only hope is that the young couple will get along and that we will have a little grandson. This kind of thinking is of course outdated in the modern trend, but I am from this kind of family, in this kind of environment, so this old concept cannot be eliminated. I have come here today to ask you a very presumptuous question: does Zhu Zhai come to see you every day? Do you two have an engagement? I hope you will tell me." As soon as Qi Wan heard this, she stood up and said, "Yes, we are engaged." Yu Ru said, "Have you considered this matter carefully? Do you know my family's situation?" Qi Wan said, "I know everything. I have already considered it. We are united in spirit. I think that in the future, if the environment is not good, I can eat roots and assist Zhu Zhai in overcoming difficulties. I will never have problems due to financial difficulties. Sir, you do not need to worry about this." Yu Ru shook his head slightly, saying, "You are mistaken. The difficulty I feel is not a matter of living expenses, but a matter of handling my family's affairs. For Zhu Zhai to marry you, he must divorce his wife. This cannot be approved by my family, especially Zhu Zhai's mother is strongly opposed. In the future, you will not have a title in my family. Although you love Zhu Zhai, you do not even fight for this little bit of status?"</p>
<h3>A Snippet from Churchill's Memoirs</h3>
<p>— Lei Hong</p>
<p>Churchill is drafting his immortal memoirs. His report will surely include the following story:</p>
<p>During the Tehran Conference, he requested a private meeting with Stalin, with no one else present except for an interpreter. Their meeting lasted four and a half hours. During the meeting, in addition to telling him about the various matters to be discussed, Stalin also talked about the Soviet political organization, how every citizen could rise in the political or economic circles, and other idle chatter.</p>
<p>Then they talked about Soviet suspicion of Anglo-American policies. "Do you think we are going to attack your country?" Churchill asked him.</p>
<p>Stalin nodded.</p>
<p>Churchill asked again, "Why do you think so?"</p>
<p>"Because," Stalin said, "if I were you, I would do it!"</p>

<p>Good books are the best friends, to be cherished forever. (Tupper)</p>

<h3>The White House Switchboard Operator</h3>
<p>— Mao Yi</p>
<p>Since the installation of the telephone in the White House in 1878, it had always been managed by men. It was not until the morning of March 7, 1933, that a woman named Hachmi Stein took over.</p>
<p>The name of this lady listed on the American government's payroll is: "Ms. Louis Lilian Hachmi Stein." However, the late President Roosevelt, his family living in the White House, his subordinates, and cabinet members all simply called her "Haki." Some called her that out of affection, but most did so for convenience.</p>
<p>In her youth, Haki never dreamed that one day she would be talking to presidents, emperors, nobles, and dignitaries from various countries. At first, she could not help but be cautious and somewhat fearful. However, after a few years, she became more natural. When Mrs. Roosevelt invited King George VI and Queen Elizabeth to a "hot dog" picnic at Hyde Park, Haki was also invited to accompany them. By then, she had been serving in the White House for six years, and everything had become familiar to her, so she was able to shake hands and say goodbye to the guests calmly and gracefully without excessive practice.</p>
<p>During Roosevelt's tenure, the White House switchboard operators memorized important phone numbers. When the New Deal was implemented, the phones were busiest. New agencies were constantly being established in large numbers. Haki's first task every night before going to bed was to recite and memorize the phone numbers of these new agencies. From then on, she built a small telephone reference library for herself. There were several books dedicated to recording private phone numbers.</p>
<p>When President Truman and his family moved into the White House, Haki and her subordinates began memorizing another large batch of new numbers, but these numbers were much fewer compared to before. Haki recorded every new number that Truman and his family dialed, and her subordinates did the same. Within a few days, they had memorized the most frequently dialed numbers.</p>
<p>Managing the telephone room for Truman was much simpler than during Roosevelt's tenure. When Roosevelt left Washington on tour, Haki was always one of his companions. Because Roosevelt relied heavily on the telephone, Haki was the best person to handle the switching. Every morning when Roosevelt woke up, the telephone would start ringing, and Haki would not be able to rest until he went to bed.</p>
<p>Roosevelt had a good habit of always informing the telephone room of his whereabouts, no matter where he was. His secretary would often notify Haki: "The President is at his desk working" or "He is in the swimming pool."</p>
<p>Truman was different. He did not have the habits of his predecessor. And the White House was not small, and there were not few telephones. Which extension was the most convenient for the President? Haki was smart. If she did not know where Truman was, she would first call the telephone in the hallway and ask the guard on duty to tell her the President's whereabouts.</p>
<p>Although Haki knew the philosophy of "smiling voices" for switchboard operators from her early telephone training, she did not apply it in the White House telephone room. "I don't want my girls to be as sweet as honey," she said. "I only want them to be happy to the extent that it does not hinder efficiency. If they use smiling voices in their own time, I will not interfere."</p>
<p>Every new White House switchboard operator learns how to address people by their rank or title. If the President's red light comes on, the switchboard operator immediately plugs in the plug and says, "Yes, Mr. President." To the other party, they say, "The President is calling," or simply, "The President of the United States."</p>
<p>For more than a decade, Haki has been operating the "National One Four One Four" telephone number. She is competent and happy in her work. And her greatest sorrow is the sudden death of Roosevelt, who never forgot to send her a gift on her birthday. This sorrow cannot be dispelled by time.</p>
<h3>The World's Largest Department Store</h3>
<p>— Liang Zai</p>
<p>Macy's Department Store in New York is a grand 22-story building located between 7th Avenue, Broadway, 34th Street, and 35th Street, occupying an entire block. It is famous for its comprehensive collection of goods, from priceless jewelry and clothing to kitchen brooms costing a few cents.</p>
<p>Every morning, 11,000 employees waiting for Macy's to open their doors walk through the hundreds of glass doors and return to their positions. Then, this miniature "city" begins its activities. On average, 137,000 customers flock to Macy's every day, swarming like a tide among the huge pillars and counters. They appreciate various goods, fiddle with wool and silk with their fingers, and the crowds never seem to decrease until closing time. Macy's daily turnover averages $400,700, or about $126 million per year.</p>
<p>After Macy's iron doors are closed, another batch of workers uses trailers, vacuum cleaners, rags, and brooms to clean up dust and dirt. This cleaning team also numbers in the thousands.</p>
