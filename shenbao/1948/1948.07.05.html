<h3>對日和約仍本一貫立塲　我完成初步草案　葉公超談交涉召開對日和會經過</h3>
<p>〔中央社南京四日電〕中央社記者本日訪外部葉次長公超，詢以關於對日和約問題。葉氏將我政府與各有關國家交涉召開對日和會之詳細經過，答覆如下：</p>
<p>世界局勢日趨嚴重，同盟國間對於各種問題之歧見尙在加深與擴大之中，因此戰後全而和平迄尙未能恢復。而對德對日和約之尙未完成，亦使盟國關係為之緊張。</p>
<p>兩年來對於德日和約之簽訂，我政府曾有多次之努力，惟因和會組織及程序問題，各國未能協議，以致彼此商談陷於僵局。</p>
<p>卅六年七月，美國曾建議召開對日和會預備會議，主張由十一個對日作戰國家，以平等資格共同起草和約，依三分之二之表決成立決議。我政府當時對美國所提辦法雖不滿意，但為促成對日和會之早開，及對日和約之早訂，當時並未立即作肯定或否定之答覆。但聲明如任何國家拒絕接受美國所提議之會議，則中國將對此事重行考慮其立塲，並提議對日和約最後大會可在中國舉行。其後因蘇聯堅持對日和會預備會議，只應由中美英蘇四國組成，美國建議逐無結果。卅六年九月王部長赴紐約出席聯合國大會，其主要目的在藉此機會與英美蘇代表於會外商洽召開對日和會問題。王部長曾與美國務卿及英蘇代表再三磋商此事，並堅促彼等接受一個中國準備提出的折衷方案。但盟國間一般關係惡化，英美蘇對我方之提議均不肯作確定之答覆。卅六年十一月，中國鑒於遠東之和平及正常狀態，應予早日恢復，因再發動正式向美英蘇三國提出照會，建議儘速召開對日和約預備會議。並正式提出一折衷建議案，以期迅速打開僵局。此項建議為和約預備會議，應由十一國參加，不應限於中美英蘇四國，會議中之議案可由多數表決，但此項多數務必包括中美英蘇四國。易言之即此四國應各保有否決權。我國此項方案，一方面對於曾實際參加對日作戰之十一國之利益，悉予尊重；一方面，可使中國在和會中獲得特殊之保障，不致被迫接受中國反對之和約草案。且英美蘇三國旣同樣享有此種保障，彼等實無反對此方案之理由。不意蘇聯之答覆，仍堅持其四國會議之主張。經我再度促請同意後，仍祗允其他七國參加對日和約預備會議中之小組委員會，而不允其出席預備會議參加表決。澳國極力反對蘇聯之主張，即對我方之折衷方案，亦認為不能同意。美國政府迄今對我方所提折衷方案仍保持緘默。因之對日和會問題，遂再度擱淺。至對日和約草案，我政府自日本投降後，即不斷有所進備。卅六年八月更專設機構，就和約主要條款分列專題，作深入之研討。同時徵詢各方人士意見，政府有關部門亦均派有代表參加提供意見，和約初步草案巳告完成。現研討工作仍在繼續進行中。由以上事實觀察，即知我國政府對於召開對日和會問題，曾盡其應盡之責任。對日和會迄今未能召開，其原因不在中國政府之未盡其責。政府今後自當繼續企求對日和約之早日成立，以副全國人士之期望。同時我政府仍保持其一貫之立塲，俾中國能在和會中保有特殊之地位。蓋必如是吾　　人方能希望實現吾人所認為確能保障中國利益及世界和平之和約。</p>
<h3>農地改革法草案　蕭錚定今日提立院討論</h3>
<p>〔本報南京四日電〕中國土地改革協會為解決中國土地問題，經集合各土地改革專家研商多日之結果，頃已草擬一「農地改革法草案」，即將由該會理事長蕭錚以立委之身份向立院提出。四日下午四時，蕭氏特招待熱心土地改革之立委，地政專家及新聞記者，發表該內容，並由各立委廣泛交換意見，對原草案加以補充及修正，該草案之擬定，係根據憲法第」四三條，其目的為實行耕者有其田，依過去「農地改革法草案」之規定，全國農地自該法實行之日起，一律歸自為耕作之農民所有，自耕農一戶所有之農田，其面積以不超過維持一家八口生活必需之範圍為限，惟農地承受人應對原所有權人補償地價，其地價不得超渦約定地租額之七倍，總額以當地主要農產物計算，分十四年淸償。</p>
<h3>動用援華款項　訂購剩餘軍火　美陸軍部允儘量協助</h3>
<p>〔合衆計華盛頓三日電〕援華計劃因中美雙邊協定之簽訂，前途燦爛。同時，關於中國動用一億二千五百萬元之軍事援華基金，秘密步驟正在加速進行中。</p>
<p>中國可能獲得更多之戰事物資，雖然軍事援助包括於國會撥款法案中，但並不交由經濟復興總署執行，美國並同意「不附條件」，但此種原因反使中國政府難予獲得戰事物資。中美雙方官員均無法預測第一批軍械及設備將於何時抵達中國海岸。但消息靈通方面稱，已採取兩種積極步驟：第一，國務院已給予中國記賬之細則，以及如何編製消費報告；第二，美國政府已準備中國開始實際定貨。中國在以前曾抱怨無法找到帮助渠等定貨之官員，現陸軍部已指定一羣「定貨」接洽者，以基爾克萊斯特中校為首，渠曾隨魏德邁調查團赴華，最近始返歸美國。依服援外法，中國原可自由使用，然中國以為如無美國之顧問，渠等將不能獲得最佳之交易，尤其重要者，中國通知國務院，渠等需要訂購剩餘軍火，以其價廉及交貨迅速，而不願訂購新製之設備及軍械。陸軍部已同意協助中國儘量訂購剩餘軍火，包括堆存於太平洋各島者在內。此外，中國並希望在剩餘軍火完竭時，能訂購美國之軍械存貨，但後者仍未決定，因將考慮其是否合法也。</p>

<h3>監院座談會　商同意權等問題</h3>

<p>〔本報南京四日電〕軍聞社訊：海軍桂總司令永淸，於上月初旬親率艦隊於黃海，渤海，截擊匪船，以切斷匪軍關內外運輸接濟，現已返京。記者昨訪桂氏，承告此次黃海渤海作戰情形及長江作戰情勢甚詳。桂氏首指明目前黃海渤海匪軍水上運輸為關內外匪軍主要交通補給綫，此次在山東海面渤海灣巡弋二十餘日，幾無日不有匪船為我艦截獲及擊燬，山東半島之海洋，石島，萬州灣，虎頭崖，三山灣，卦角，源岐口及遼東半島之營口，蓋平，以及大淸河，洋河口一帶，匪軍補給船隻，經我艦擊燬捕獲者達一百數十餘艘，我艦並砲擊石島，榮成灣，威海衛，樂家口等地匪軍陣地。桂氏親自指揮艦隊，曾深入營口內港，轟擊西砲台及營市匪軍電工廠，所有各該港口匪方工事陣地，全被我摧毀，沿海匪軍原據守各港口，以為轉運補給之基地，經此摧毀後，現均失其作用，於整個戰局實有重大影響。桂氏嗣述及江防作戰時，不時就其壁上所懸地圖指示說明，總計本年三四兩月中，我江防艦隊與匪軍大小戰鬥五十餘次，斃匪六百七十三人，俘匪四十人，擊沉匪船一百六十只，繳獲匪糧二百餘担，營救脫險客貨商輪二十艘，本年五月後，戰鬥更趨激烈，我海軍艦艇沿江進剿結果，五六兩月共擊斃匪軍達三千餘人，擊沉匪船四十只，匪軍渡江迷夢完全破碎。桂氏末並表示最近將重赴海上指揮作戰。</p>
<h3>青年黨發表聲明　決定參加行政院　政務委員二人另行提名</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕靑年黨昨（四日）下午三時舉行中常會，討論參加政府問題，直至九時方散。十時李璜即通知雷震，聲明該黨決定參加政府，並請代為轉知。農林，工商兩部長左舜生，陳啓天即可晋京就職，政務委員原為鄭振文，楊永浚兩氏，現聞該黨擬另行提名，正徵求政府同意。該黨並決定參加立院，惟名額尙未宣布。</p>
<p>又靑年黨發言人王師曾，四日發表書面聲明如下：本黨從參加制憲國大以至行憲國大，一本促進民主憲政實施，完成現代國家建設之主旨，與國民·民社兩黨開誠合作，分祖行憲建國的責任。前以立委問題久懸不決，本黨為遵循民主政治須有議席纔有關席的常軌起見，曾經一再聲明，在立委問題未解決以前，不能參加行政院。月餘以來，不斷與國民黨負責人士協商，謀立委問題之解決，在彼此互諒互讓之精神下，已逐漸獲得原則上的一致，惟以事實上之困難，尙須經過相當時間，始能全部實現。在此往返協商時期，承張岳軍·吳鐵城·陳布雷·雷儆實諸先生，再三轉送國民黨負責當局之意旨，殷股以貫澈三黨合作，繼續參加政府，共濟時局艱難，來相敦促。吳鐵城·陳布雷兩先生，並以國民黨負責人之地位，先後發表聲明，重申三黨合作之旨趣及願望，情詞異常懇切。本黨基於對國家之責任感及接受友黨合作之誠意，決定繼參加監察院及提名司法院大法官，考試院考試委員之後，提出參加行政院之人選，繼續參加行政院，以分担一部份之政務責任，期能對於國事有所褲益。</p>
<p>〔本報南京四日電〕陳布雷·吳鐵城兩氏為敦勸民·靑兩黨繼續三黨團結之精神，即參加政院，共同推進政務之書面談話發表後，聞靑年黨對此已表同意，主持農林工商兩部之靑年黨人士左舜生·陳啓天·已定五日夜車由滬來京，將趕上周三舉行之政務會議，至總統前發表任命之政務委員，該黨人士鄭振文·楊永浚兩氏聞即將辭職，該黨在行政院長雲文灝之延攪下，復已提出林可璣·劉靜遠兩氏出任政委，並悉：總統對靑年黨政委之另行推定事，業巳知悉，故任命令可望即日發表。另民社黨對此事尙無表示，徐傳霖則稱：決不參加政院，至於立委，如國民黨能再退讓五名，民社黨當即可集體出席立院會竄。</p>
<h3>立委二百餘人　組革新俱樂部</h3>
<p>其發言人談成立宗旨</p>
<p>〔中央社南京四日電〕立法委員二百餘人，所發起之革新俱樂部，上月成立，其發言人頃稱：革新俱樂部之宗旨，乃在聯絡感情，交換意見，團結進步份子，共同促進政治之革新。我國行憲伊始，國人正宜學民主作風，養成民主習慣，議會政治，旣為民主生活方式之實施，立院同仁，更應首為倡導，妥善運用，以期奠定民主政治之基礎。今值戡亂時期，社會動盪不安，國人喁喁望治，對於立法院之期待，殊為殷切，吾人一面固須形成一種安定力量，一面尤應以革新求進步，以進步求安定，是故革新俱樂部成立之後，雖頗注意會員感情之聯繫及其生活興趣之增進，然同時對有關政治革新之研究，亦在積極進行．現已分為內政，外交，國防，經濟，財政，敎育，文化，法制七組。會員自由參加，隨時並請院外專家共同討論，以收集思廣益之效。該發言人又稱；革新俱樂部不但富有政治意義，且能充分表示民主自由之精神，深信定可促成中國政治之革新及民主憲政之實現。</p>

<h3>社論　中美雙邊協定的檢討</h3>
<p>關於美援之雙邊協定，平為中外所屬目，現巳於三日下午三時在首都簽字了。其要點及全文，經詳載昨日本報。其中强調穩定我國經濟之必要，同意凍結一部份法幣，以期减少通貨，並載明國人在美財產，可由中國政府有效運用，以改善國內經濟狀况，但沒有我國須在貿易上予日本及南韓以最惠國待遇的規定，這幾點，應是我國人所最感興奮的。</p>
<p>國人在美存款究有幾何，各方估計不一，多至四五十億，少僅三四億，相差達十餘倍。但如能悉數流回國內，則無論數目多寡，其於財政經濟上之助力，自非小補。茲姑不談徵用或徵稅等硬性動用的辦法，就以借用，匯款，辦貨，或轉存國行等方式，予以充分利用，其餘外匯資金之調劑，和對外貿易之促進，已遠非美援所可企及。所可惜的，是處理是項資產，美國並不協助執行，而僅由我國自行查明和指認，於可行範國內，採取措施，以期適當的使用。我們不知道，將來事實上究能辦到若何地步，是否仍是等同畫餅，可望而不可即，這就很難預計了。</p>
<p>創造較穩定之貨幣狀况，這一節，規定在協定第二條丙項內，其辦法為將一美援物資變售所得的法幣，於存入中央銀行特別帳戶後，加以部份的凍結。這項原則，早為財政當局所主張，亦為一般輿論所支持。因為要謀經濟的穩定，不得不先求通貨和物價穩定，而要求通貨和物價的穩定，却又不得不從平衡收支和减少發行入手。所以這項現款，如何加以充分有效地運用，實是當前財政上經濟上的一個重大關鍵。協定採用凍結辦法，以期减少通貨，緊縮銀根，雖不失為對症發藥的有效措施，但收支不能平衡，則增發仍所不免。如果一面凍結舊鈔，一面照常增發新鈔，這與穩定經濟，又有何補？徒使中外鈔票商，繼續發其印鈔大財，並使國庫增加一筆很大的支出而巳。</p>
<p>所稱法幣凍結的範圍，亦不是物資變售所得的全部，而僅僅是其中的一部份，或竟是一小部份。因為照協定第五條所列舉，其中必須扣除（一）美方在華機構的一切行政費用；（二）發展生產與開發富源的支出；（三）推行有關建設方案或計劃之支出；（四）繼續辦理救濟協定下尙未完成之救濟或工賑經費；（五）辦理各大城市推行配給經費。且自美援總額减至四億美元後，經濟援助部份，僅得二億七千五百萬，而依照援華法案第四〇七款（乙）項之規定，還須扣去農村復興經費百分之一。照此核算，其餘剩下來堪以凍績的法幣，為數尙有幾何，是否還能達得到收縮通貨穩定經濟的目的，這也就很難預計了。</p>
<p>在美國國會討論是案的過程中，有不少人指出我國通貨膨脹之危險，並熱烈地要求，有首先加以制止之必要，而我國同情此項主張的尤多。結果，此項變售所得的法幣，竟仍然如此四分五裂，不能集中到當前最急迫的需要上去，這無疑地，將使我國平衡財政，輿穩定經濟的努力，要增加許多困難。有人以為國人的在美資產，旣許充分有效運用，則通貨膨脹問題，或許可從這一方面去尋求解決，我們深望，這種推測能够並非純屬理想。</p>
<p>美援分經濟援助和特種援助兩大部份，除經濟項下用於特種建設的小部份，將來或須另議償還外，其餘都屬贈與性質。我們對於美國這種慷慨和熱忱，自然表示深切的謝意。但同時亦應明白了解，隨此而來的，將有許多重大的責任，和艱鉅的任務，我們必須切。實履行，以實踐自助的諾言。王外長曾經概括地指出，中國須採取可能的措施，以利用本國資源及國民財力，以發展工業及農業，改進財政幣制，减少貿易障礙，增加對外商業關係等，這都是任重道遠，並非一蹴可幾的事情，希望大家各就崗位，各盡所能，以共同肩荷這項重大的使命。</p>

<h3>開灤煤礦礦木荒　與盟總洽購日產礦木迄無結果　如談判失敗將影響生產</h3>

<h3>中國問題雖嚴重　但終能渡過難關　陳立夫在紐約發表談話</h3>
<p>〔中央社紐約三日合衆社電〕中國立法院副院長陳立夫稱：坦白言之，中國局勢頗為困難，渠對報界謂：美國援助中國之四億美元，將可使中國保持現狀，但不足使吾人向前邁進，陳氏作樂觀論調謂：中國在歷史上，曾屢經艱難，而終能渡過難關。渠相信目前問題雖嚴重，但仍能略如過去之情形，同樣解決。渠稱：余曾會晤范登堡，而對美國所推行之民主步驟，印象極深。余此次訪美目的，即為研究民主制度，俾向蔣總統提出報告，是以余對此次共和黨全代會經過印象特深，例如史塔生，塔虎脫之謙讓杜威，俾杜咸獲得所有共和黨之一致提名，即為行動中民主之偉大表現。蔣總統曾修函為余介紹數議員及杜威先生，但余猶未拜訪彼等，蓋彼等由於國會休會，及共和黨全國代表大會關係，事務繁忙也。陳氏刻擬訪問其母校匹茲堡大學，該校校長曾電陣氏勸迎其重返母校。此行渠並願訪問礦業工會會長劉易士。渠當時留美攻讀礦科時，曾在斯寬頓以實習關係加入礦業工會，陳氏指責中國共產黨與政府軍作戰時，極無人道，渠謂：共產黨恒以老弱充作前鋒，而使政府軍無從射擊，共產黨復訓練老弱，使於夜間作戰，故難以辨認。有時吾人開火而發現慘遭無辜者悉為老百姓。有時吾人不開火，而衝鋒者却為共產黨部隊。共黨作戰時，並不企圖佔領城市，而謀求破壞城市，是以政府必須設法救濟，而受牽制之部隊遂更多。此等策略之心理作用，實乃造成通貨膨脹原因之一。蓋現代戰爭並非糾在算事，亦員經濟公政治性質」。陳氏復謂。中國亟需土地及銀行改革，渠承認中國政府軍待遇至為惡劣，故常騷擾鄉民，以取得食物。渠喻中國如一病人，不但需要輸血外援，抑且需要肅淸內部自助。渠並以一般銀行由於我局動盪，不願作長期土地押款，因此不能進行長期計劃工作一端，作為戰事妨礙穩定之例證。</p>

<h3>蘇聯拒絕保證撤銷封鎖　柏林局勢趨惡化　索帥痛詆三強對德措施</h3>
<p>〔路透社柏林四日電〕蘇軍總司令索柯洛夫斯基昨夜邀英軍總司令　勃森。美軍總司令克萊。法代總司令諾亞萊至其總部會談，匪特拒絕保證對柏林西區之封鎖，並痛詆西方　國之措施，其態度為外交史上所罕有。據向蘇當局登記之德國新聞社報告，索柯洛夫斯基曾在會中對四方三司令作如下之談話：「英美法當局採取片面的分裂措施，乃產生彼等目前所遭之困難。參與決定德國分裂之倫敦會議者豈不知彼等所採決議所將引起之後果及柏林問題。西方强國旣巳決定分裂德國，何以今始想及柏林，蓋柏林固在蘇聯區內，在經濟上亦為蘇聯區之一部。西方三國代表不待蘇聯之參加，甚至並不通知蘇聯，遽即自由成立關於德國之決議，實為不顧德國人民之利益而行動。四方國家破壞德國經濟制度之企圖，迫使蘇當局不得不採取保護蘇聯區二千萬德人之辦法，此固蘇聯佔領德國生要任務之一云」。某關係方面謂索柯洛夫斯基係由通譯代言，渠於西方三司令入會議室後始入室，僅略彎腰即就座，未與在座三司令握手。在開會之半小時中，始終注視桌上文件，並不注視在座之三司令。渠於痛詆西方國家之種種措施後，並曰「我的朋友，我們不需要再有這些了」。克萊將軍事後表示彼之逗留會議室三十分鐘，僅為遵守外交上的禮節之故，法代總司令諾亞萊亦率直承認局勢已較前更形惡化。</p>
<p>〔路透社柏林三日電〕四强司令今夜在此舉行半小時之會談毫無結果，反使柏林局勢較前益趨嚴重。一般僉信柏林危機之解決，惟有由四國政府最高當局共商有力行動始能有望。聞英美法三强已草成致莫斯科之共同抗議書，擬將整個問題向更高當局提出。英方觀察家相信，柏林糾紛一且正式交由政府當局處理後，由於所牽涉的聲譽問題，勢必使蘇聯政府更難滿足西方强國為欲繼續在柏林之四强共管制而提出之最低度要求。英外次漢特森今日在柏林晤各西方盟國官員，聽取柏林最近局勢之報告，渠定四日即返倫敦。又美駐英大使陶格拉斯。法駐英大使馬西格里，英外部德國司長史屈朗組織之倫敦委員會，在週末將保持開會狀態，以待柏林最近情報。</p>
<p>〔聯合社柏林三日電〕美軍總司令克萊於會議無結果後宣稱，空運仍將繼續，且較前增多。吾人將隨美人民之意予以長久維持。昔日由駝峯空運物資至中國，曾歷一年之久，渠認為法國亦將參加緊急空運，以接濟柏林西部之人民。</p>
<h3>阿國片面毀棄經濟協定　南斥爲違反國際法　宣稱因此舉造成後果須由阿負責</h3>
<p>〔路透社貝爾格勒三日電〕南斯拉夫官方通訊社稱，南斯拉夫政府今日致牒阿爾巴尼亞政府，對於阿政府之片面撤銷兩國間之經濟協定及附約，提出答覆。照會釋明兩國在經濟合作計劃下，使經濟落伍戰時創傷未復的阿爾巴尼亞，獲益匪淺。阿國之指南方未能中實履行條約養務，顯然不確而可笑。</p>
<p>且南阿經濟協定中，曾明文規定於發生因執行經濟合作計劃而產生的任何問題時，雙方應以友好誠意的態度覓取解決。阿爾巴尼亞顯然未能遵守該款之規定，其片面毀約行動，有悖國際法之基本原則，因此所引起之後果須由阿政府負責。按阿國之決定與南斷絕經濟關係，係於七月一日以照會送達南國驻蒂拉那大使館通知，而在前一日即六月三十日，阿政府巳照會南方要求召回南國派至阿爾巴尼亞以「手足之情助其復興」之一切技術人員·敎授·及其他南國公民。按南阿於一九四六年底簽訂經濟協定，等於建立經濟同盟，規定廢止兩國間之關稅，樹立自由商務關係，並由南斯拉夫協助阿工業復興。</p>
<h3>阿經濟仰人鼻息　捋虎鬚膽大妄爲</h3>
<p>〔合衆社倫敦四日一電〕在蘇聯後援下東歐各衛星國間之軍事同盟經濟協定之精密系統，四日已開始崩潰。阿爾巴尼亞宣佈廢止與南斯拉夫之三十年關稅通貨同盟，作為狄托元帥被共產大族開除之强烈後果。南斯拉夫之抗拒克林姆宮固足驚人，然阿爾巴尼亞之捋虎　益足驚人。阿國與蘇聯間有南斯拉夫橫亘而經濟上又仰南國之鼻息，故不料其未得蘇聯保證率爾出此。今者南阿閱牆，已使史達林狄托反目一事黯然失色，蓋後者猶待克林姆宮之最後定奪也。</p>
<h3>南阿失和案　可能提海牙法庭</h3>
<p>〔合衆社貝爾格勒四日電〕權威人士四日談稱，南斯拉夫可能將與阿爾巴尼亞失和案提交聯合國或海牙國際法庭。該人士之國際法專家稱，由南斯拉夫致阿國抗議之最後數段文字觀之，提請事似為理所必然之第二步驟。官方對此一步驟之採納與否迄無跡象，然觀察家　認為如阿國仍堅決不肯讓步，則南國之　請國際人士仲裁可能發生。</p>
<h3>蘇荷訂貿易協定</h3>

<h3>柏林西區工資　四之一發新幣</h3>
<p>〔路透社柏林四日電〕柏林西區當局頃頒發有關幣制之命令，宣布西區工人之工資，祇四分之一發給德意志馬克，商界人士認西方盟國此舉，等於承認蘇聯發行之東德馬克。西區當局之佈告，並釋明西方當局原無使西區經濟完全以德意志馬克為基礎之意，故前此業巳規定東德馬克亦得在柏林西區支付房屋租金，配給食糧及交通費用。當局在柏林西區發行之德意志馬克，數量僅以足供柏林維特其對西德之經濟關係及參加國際貿易為限度。</p>
<h3>美最高目標　建立十節和平</h3>
<p>杜魯門總統之演說詞</p>
<p>〔路透社華盛頓三日電〕社魯門總統今日在華盛頓紀念塔奠基之百週年紀念儀式中致辭，謂美國之目標，祗在使世界獲得基於公理的和平，美國為爭取世界自由，曾參加兩次大戰，美國並無土地野心，亦並不要求賠償。渠盼偉大的政治家馬歇爾能使美國成為和平的活動照顧者。</p>
<h3>貝那多特和平方案公布　主阿猶組成聯邦　建議如被拒絕將程覆安理會</h3>
<p>〔路透社成功湖四日電〕此間官方透露，聯合國巴勒斯　斡旋專員貝那多特之巴勒斯坦永久和平難議，規定組織猶太國與阿拉伯國之聯邦，而以耶路撒冷劃入阿拉伯國，該一建議案已於六月廿八日向猶阿雙方提出。貝那多特雞議之猶阿聯邦，規定建在原來之巴勒斯坦委治地上，包括現為外約但王國之部份，巴勒斯坦南部尼日夫沙漠區之全部或一部，劃入阿拉伯國，北部西迦列里省之全部或一部則劃入猶太國，耶路撒冷雖劃入阿拉伯國，但猶太居民得享受市自治。海發港及里達，分別闢為自由海港及自由航空站。</p>
<p>此外，貝那多特之建議案並主張下列事項：（一）猶阿兩國疆界，先在貝氏之協助下進行談判，然後由疆界委員會肯定勘定。（二）巴勒斯坦聯邦應促進共同的經濟利益，維　關稅及其他國庫稅等共同事業，執行建設及開發計劃，及聯絡外交國防政策等。（三）此等職權由一中央委員會行使。（三）猶阿兩國本國國界內之入境移民歸猶阿本國處理，但於聯邦成立後之兩年後，猶阿任何一國得請聯邦委員會檢討另一國內之移民問題。貝氏建議案中之次要諸點，包括保護宗敎及少數民族之權利，保護聖蹟及宗敎設備，及准許因衝突而流離他遷之居民重返故居等。貝那多特並聲明以上及以後其他建議如果堪被作為討論基礎，渠將繼續其斡旋任務，如被拒絕，渠將迅速呈覆安理事會。</p>
<h3>貝那多特離開羅　遄返羅特島</h3>
<p>阿盟對貝氏提出反建議</p>
<p>〔路透社開羅四日電〕貝那多特今日啓程返羅特島前，曾與埃一總理諾克拉茜長　，諾氏在會　時以阿拉伯國答以那多特建議之正式覆文向貝氏提出，其中並附反建議案。貝氏事後表示，猶方對其建議之覆文，可望於明日接理，渠將費數日時間加以研究，員那多特昨夜曾與阿盟機要委員會密談，事後與會之黎巴嫩總理索爾構，阿拉伯方面巳告知貝氏不能接受其建議作為談判基礎，董阿拉伯方面仍堅決主張　在巴勒斯坦建立一似阿拉伯國故也。又開羅阿拉伯人士預料猶太方面亦將拒絕貝那多特之建議，蓋尼日夫區之劃歸阿拉伯國，將迫使猶方中止移民入境，且將切斷猶太國與死海區製鉀工業之聯絡，此固猶太國主要收入之一。此外猶太國主張耶城交聯合國託管，反對置入阿拉伯管轄之下。</p>

<h3>美下屆總統　共和黨可當選</h3>
<p>美第一流記者意見</p>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓三日電〕據新聞週刋載稱，美國各卓越政治作家等一致預料共和黨今年可當選總統。新聞週刋曾向華盛頓五十名第一流政治記者徵求意見，問以共和民主兩黨中何黨可當選下屆總統？影響選舉之最重要因素為何？彼等一致預料共和黨可當選總統，其理由為民主黨執政太久，對杜魯門及其政府缺乏信仰，民主黨內部有分裂，華萊士組織第三黨，</p>
<h3>美將與西歐五國　商軍事同盟　希土亦有帝盟可能</h3>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓三日電〕權成方面三日指出：美國可能立即與白魯塞爾公約五國家會商成立軍事防禦侵略同盟事宜，此五個國家包括英國·法國·比利時·荷關及盧森堡。</p>
<p>〔合衆社雅典三日電〕此間軍事及外交方面預測，土耳其參謀總長奧姆坦格可能在此次訪希期內，與希臘訂立軍事同盟，蓋渠現正與政府之高級政治及軍事領袖秘密會談。美國方面認為，以前土耳其担心蘇聯在柏林危機以後，將轉而對其加强壓力，現則已消滅或已獲得解決，故已決定覓取積極之支援，以為應付。</p>
<h3>美慶祝獨立紀念　舉國竟日狂歡恣意尋樂</h3>
<p>〔中央社紐約四日電〕美國人民今慶祝第一百七十二週年獨立紀念日。猶憶一七七六年之此日，建國元勳即以傑茀遜所揭　之生活權。自由權·及追逐快樂權之原則，宣佈美國獨立，從此美國各地發表愛國演說，及放烟火等，遂成為定例。成千成萬美國人，即乘此假日之便，赴海灘及其他游憇之地。紐約市民出城游賞者，約有三百萬人，由鄉問入城觀光者亦有數萬人。本日各地美人之穿梭往來，將使公路上擠滿汽車，為數可能達三千萬輛。今年七月四日之到來，適在四年一度之全國選舉政治情况熟烈之際，但美國人今日將忘却政治，而盡情享受一日之歡樂。</p>
<p>枉死者逾百人</p>
<p>〔合衆社芝加哥三日電〕由於獨立紀念日之狂歡，三日晚已使美國意外事件之死亡數，超過一百人，然此尙不　開其端而已。數百萬之美國人離開城市，赴鄉村及海灘度其週末，旅行之擁擠已開歷史先例。死亡數隨假期而激增，至少一百廿二人已作故人。車輛肇禍死六十五人，溺斃二十人，爆炸死一人，墮機死二人，其他死卅四人。各州中以紐約及賓夕凡尼亞之各死九人創最高紀錄。</p>
<h3>動盪不安的拉丁美洲</h3>
<p>—是美國的隱夏—</p>
<p>哥倫比亞　人民一千萬，由於通貨膨脹，生活日艱。</p>
<p>經濟方面，主要工業為出產油及貴重金屬品。生產消費品的工廠巳增加，咖啡的輸出類僅次於巴西</p>
<p>卜立芝總統所領導的政府是民主機構。共產黨員約一萬人，今年四月發生大流血叛變，目前除非共黨領袖奧斯此那能控制各反對黨，不致發生革命，但小規模的暴動可能發生。</p>
<p>中美洲六國家　瓜地馬拉，洪都拉斯，巴拿馬，哥斯達黎加，尼加拉瓜及聖薩爾瓦多，統計人口九百萬。上列地區輸出品為水菓，咖啡，可可，棉，糖，金，牲畜及纖維品等，通貨膨賬狀態比南美洲為緩和。除巴拿馬及哥斯達黎加外，政治上不斷發生革命及獨裁，除哥斯達黎加外，各國共產黨力量脆弱。</p>
<p>翁紹裘寄自紐約</p>
<p>目前各國的政治趨勢如下：</p>
<p>瓜地馬拉恐將發生革命</p>
<p>聖薩爾瓜多政府組織不健全。</p>
<p>哥斯達黎加最近所發生的二十年來首次革命，飄搖於風雨中。</p>
<p>巴拿馬最近因選舉而發生風波。</p>
<p>古巴　人民五百萬，經濟的命脈是糖的出產，古巴轍出的糖量，佔全世界第一位。</p>
<p>古巴政府是民主機構，共產黨人數約十五萬，但共黨的政策比較上偏重於以政治方式擴充其力量，暴動比較少。</p>
<p>上次革命發生於一九三三年，目前無革命趨勢，但政府恐懼共然將展開暴動。</p>
<p>墨西哥　過去曾經常發生革命，但自從一九三八年發生小規模的叛變後，迄今政治上未發生風波。</p>
<p>墨西哥人二千三百萬。工業逐漸增加，工業範圍已由鐵及石油的生產擴充至藥品生產。</p>
<p>亞里門總統所領導的政府是民主政府，共黨黨員號稱二萬人，但沒有實力，目前不致發生嚴重的不安事件。</p>
<p>多明尼加　共和國自一九三〇年以來，一直在蒙里那元帥的統治中。</p>
<p>全國人口二百萬，生活水準已逐漸改善。</p>
<p>政治方面，政府實行獨裁制度，工業規模甚小，一九四七年叛軍曾企岡由古巴開入，但結果失敗。</p>
<p>蒙里那元帥擁有秘密警察，秘密警察如繼續對他忠心，不致發生政變。</p>
<p>海地　與多明尼加比隣，人三百萬，大部份人民仍度着原始農民生活。</p>
<p>海地政府是民主組織，共黨力量脆弱，一九四五年曾發生革命，目前不致發生革命。</p>
<p>委內瑞拉　主要工業是石油，輸出品也以石油為大宗。所輸出的未經煉製的石油，佔世界第一位。</p>
<p>委內瑞拉人口四百萬人，葛勤哥斯總統所領導的政府是民主組織，共黨黨員約二萬人，但並不能密切合作。一九四六年曾發生革命，結果失敗，前任總統企圖重獲政權。但目前沒有革命趨勢。</p>
<p>烏拉圭　是拉丁美洲各國中最民主的國家，人口二千二百萬，人民生活比其他拉丁美洲國家人民較佳。</p>
<p>主要工業是生產肉品，亞麻子及其他農產品。</p>
<p>一九三五年曾有革命，目前政治安定。</p>
<p>阿根廷　人民一千六百萬，大致上生活較佳，工業也比其他南美國家進步，出產品大部為消費品，但重工業已開始經營。</p>
<p>阿根廷共黨號稱有黨員三萬人，但力量不大。一九四三年曾發生革命，目前政洽安定。</p>
<p>綜上所述，可知拉丁美洲各國大部份有保持和平的可能，但仍有一部份國家可能於數月內發生災難，不過大規模的革命或不致發生。拉丁美洲各國的政治，總是由權成人物領導，而使政府趨於安定。但進步遲緩，人民希望改善生活，一部份人民為實現理想曾採取行動。（下）</p>

<h3>風雨氷雹毀屋多處　京江公所死傷百餘　社局蘇北同鄉會今日開會商討善後</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕昨晨二時許氣候突變，狂風疾至，暴雨驟降，有如排山倒海，益以雷電助勢，大雨中並降下十餘年所未有之冰電，整個上海被龍罩於此恐怖氣氛中，達四十分鐘之久。其間以風雨過於在急，致各處電桿·籬牆·廣告牌及簡陋之建築物，被襲擊而倒坍者甚多，其中最慘者，為打浦路三〇六弄二號之京江寄柩所內，竟坍毀平房八十間，被壓於殘垣斷樑下之難民達四百餘人之多，載至昨日下午止，已悉死亡達二十七人，傷八十九人。</p>
<p>京江公所戰前本為京江問鄉會寄柩之所，去年十月起絡續為大批蘇北難民佔住其間，將所厝棺柩移堆一間，甚至有棄堆屋外者。居戶共編為七十四戶，一部份住於東首之屋內，餘則在西首另建瓦屋八十間居住，數達四百餘人。擁擠吶雜，污穢不堪。昨夜以天氣炎熱，故均在屋外乘涼，至深夜後始回屋就寢。不意至二時許好夢正酣，狂風突起，驟降冰雹，繼而暴雨如注，奔騰如千軍萬馬。該處房屋因建築簡陋，不堪襲擊，致於二時五十八分轟然一聲，全部倒坍，難民猝不及防，全部被壓於斷垣殘本下。一時秩序大亂，哭聲震天。旋警局及消防處得報，立即通知各區救護車出動急救，警察局長俞叔平，消防處長周兆祥，亦率同盧家灣警察分局局長宋廷鈞，股長鍾鶴，王立賢，股員董益祥，警長馮伯鈞，警員張漢卿，趙恒淸，劉香林等十餘人，親自冒雨馳赴現塲指揮。經各員警歷十餘小時之發掘結果，在現塲扒出屍體二十四具。送抵醫院後斃命者三人。其他受傷者經分送廣慈·中山·紅十字會·南洋·市立第八等醫院救治。留有紀錄可查者達八十九人，而臨時包紮後即行出院者尙不在其內。其中以廣慈醫院收容最多，該院傅倍彬醫師且曾自行抽血三百西西救治一朮傷難民，此種精神尤　難能可貴。</p>
<p>記者於下午三時抵達現塲，時救護車尙停留該處從事裝載傷者，至坍屋處則僅留一片瓦礫，死裏逃生之幸運者踞坐其上，有長吁短嘆者，有失其父母子弟而號淘痛哭者，聞之令人酸鼻。</p>
<p>死亡名單</p>
<p>茲將死亡者之姓名探錄於下：現傷壓斃者：顧康和，六十歲。吳有弟，三歲。黃張氏，四十歲。封弟弟，三歲。魏世吾，五四歲。陳陸氏，四五歲。陳如山，八歲。陳如愷，十一歲。魏王氏，五四歲。左瑞淸，三八歲。左學生，八歲。左宣之，四二歲。陳山榆，四歲。周挂英，十二歲。以上均係早寗人。朱吳氏，五八歲。王恒元，廿四歲。孫蕭氏，四五歲。梁吳氏，五八歲。黃陳氏，廿一歲。徐小狗，四歲。周　，十九歲。朱樹蘭，三歲。以上均係鹽城人。孫黃氏，廿三歲，東台人。徐任治，六三歲，如皋人。共計廿四人。送院後死亡者三人，劉繼漢，廿一歲。沈劉氏，卅五歲。馬維卿，六十歲。均係鹽城人。</p>

<h3>調整公用事業價　公用局說明兩點</h3>
<p>市公川局為市民明瞭公用事業價格性　及說明各公用事業維持供應困難起見，特說明兩點如左。</p>
<p>（一）公用事業價格遠較其他物價落後；</p>
<p>公用事業價格的調整，是根據上個月發表的指數和已知的物價來計算的，所以總是跟在物價後面，而每次計算出來的價格，又總是設法壓低，這樣逐月壓低下去，到現在已經和一般物價比較落後很遠了。試觀中國工商協會所編六月二十日至廿六日一週間的批發物價指數：</p>
<p>食物類　一、三八〇、一七四倍</p>
<p>紡織品類　一、九七八、九四六倍</p>
<p>燃料類　一、五一三、九七五倍</p>
<p>金屬類　一、九六四、八三五倍</p>
<p>建築材料類　一、八四五、九八七倍</p>
<p>化學品類　二、六九八、六二一倍</p>
<p>雜項類　一、七〇六、二〇六倍</p>
<p>總指數　一、七〇八，四八一倍最近一週內，又各漲若干成，總指數當在二百萬倍左右，　昨日公佈之七月份水，電，煤氣新價格和戰前比較倍數如下：</p>
<p>自來水</p>
<p>零售　三〇〇、〇〇〇倍　普通　八二五、〇〇〇倍</p>
<p>電燈十度以下　三四七、〇〇〇倍</p>
<p>十一度至三十度　四六三、〇〇〇倍</p>
<p>三十一度以上　五七八、〇〇〇倍</p>
<p>實際用電二十度的用戶所付祗為四〇五〇〇〇倍，用電三十度的用戶所付祗爲四二四，〇〇〇倍</p>
<p>煤氣　一、〇〇〇、〇〇〇倍</p>
<p>以之比較米價的二百萬倍，煤價約三百多萬倍，紗布價約二三　萬倍·最小者僅及七分之一，最大者亦不到二分之一·</p>
<p>（二）公用事業每月祗准調整一次，祗求勉强維持供應，不致影響其他物價：</p>
<p>政府很明暸一般平民購買力的一低落，所以對於一般平民的公用事業負担，總是儘量壓低，如這次自來水的免費供應，或低價的零售水，以及電燈的分級制，都是本月定價的特色，電燈每十度用一只廿五瓦的燈泡，可以點四百小時，假定一個普通小家庭，用三只廿五瓦的電燈，每大全點四小時，一個月祗需九度，我們所以定十度為最低標準。上月份（六月份）所定公用事業價格的標準，是在假定上月內物價平穩，使各公司可以平衡收支為準則一，但不料一般物價迭起劇烈漲風，以致各公司雖一再緊縮，幾於羅掘俱窮，仍不能支付月底生活指數發表後之補發薪工，而不得不由政府為之協助借款應付。本月所定價格，乃與上月取同樣之標準，使能勉强維持供應，以免停頓。惟其價格，旣遠在其他物價之下，自不能據為抬高物價的口實希望市民明暸。</p>
<p>上圖為遠眺乍浦海濱浴塲全景，右岡上為戲水海濱之上海女郎，下為在該地避暑之俄僑。（本報攝）</p>
<h3>乍浦海濱浴場　猶存原始氣息　朝去夕歸成週末消署勝地</h3>
<p>小普陀島傳來暮鼓晨鐘　公路平坦四望風景絕美</p>
<p>〔本報特寫〕距上海南方九十公里之乍浦海濱浴塲，已成為滬上仕女週末唯一之避暑勝地，且交通便利，汽車可朝發夕返。</p>
<p>海濱浴傷實位於黃姑鎭黃山之麓，為前往乍浦途中必經之地，沙灘平細，天然劃分為西中東三部份，其面積之大較香港淺水灣有過之無不及，唯一分別之點，淺水灣則已加人工琢磨，具有現代設備，而黃山浴場，尙保持原始氣息。惟近處風平浪靜，與遠景小島風帆，情趣則無稍稍異。風景佳麗，可稱江南一絕。如謂蘇杭無錫宜作春秋之遊，則黃山浴塲將首推為夏季康樂勝區。</p>
<p>目前前往黃山海濱避暑者，什九多為俄僑，鄉民特在山麓臨時築有茅屋數百間，出租與長期避暑之人士，其價每間自六七千萬元至一億元不等，惟建築簡陋，僅能遮避風雨，然饒有　趣，足使遊人一寬胸襟。</p>
<p>浴塲面對佛地小島小普陀，上有巨剎觀音庵，隱沒於綠樹叢中，每聞暮鼓晨鐘，與碧海濤聲遙相呼應時，則情意淸絕，佳趣無窮。</p>
<p>昨為星期假日，滬上人士前往遊覺者，頗不乏人。而俄僑聯合會　備有大卡車四五輛，成羣作竟日遊。浴塲棚屋內，犬半爲俄僑所居住，置身其間，如入「羅宋小村」中。</p>
<p>記者一行，昨循滬閔南柘公路前往，行二十一公里至閔行，渡江輸已自去年改為平面大鐵駁，可裝大卡車五六輛或小轎車十餘輛，上置柴油引擎，來往殊便，渡江費已隨近日物價飛漲，而加調整，計貨車與大卡車每次為九十四萬元，七座以下之小客車為七十萬元，機器脚踏車為廿四萬元。渡江後再行二十一公里至拓林，七公里至漕涇，十四公里至金山衛，六公里至江浙交界之金絲娘橋，入浙境後，十九公里至黃山海濱，二公里至乍浦鎭。車行時間全程約三小時半。公路殊為平坦，而江蘇省內一段尤較寬暢，滬乍間之路基，三分之二係行走於海塘之上，一邊阡陌相連，一邊濤聲船影，風景優美。自閔行至乍浦綫，經常有長途汽車，每日來往一次。自乍浦　往杭州之公路車，則每晨八時半雙方對開一次。自上海前往黃山浴塲，另有一捷徑，可搭火車至嘉典，然後轉乘公路車經平湖至乍浦。</p>
<p>設黃山浴傷能加以現代設備，則無疑為江南唯一之優良海水浴塲，足可媲美嶺南港島與北國靑島也·</p>
<h3>總工會召開座談會　檢討工人運動方向　勞資合作能突破難關</h3>
<p>市總工會昨晨九時，於該會大禮堂召開各工會負責人座談會，出席水祥雲·周學湘·葉翔皋·方如升·章祝三等二百餘人，情况熱烈。水祥雲等分別報告，交涉生活指數經過詳情及新會所基金等問題，直至下午二時始告散會。昨日座談會所有重要報告部份，計為：（一）工人繳付新兵安家費折衝之經過，現仍維適齡壯丁中熟米五斗，無出征軍人家屬二十萬元之最低標準（由方升如報告）。（二）參議會六次大會中工界參議員所提提案之內容（由周學湘報告）。（三）此次請求市政當局變更生活指數變更編製之經過（由章祝三報告）。（四）新會所基金之征收工作（由葉翔皋，周雲江報告）。最後由各工會負責人，熱烈檢討今後工人運動之路綫，一致認為階級對立乃滅亡之途，唯有勞資合作，始能突破難關。</p>
<h3>飛機用油　吳虞匱乏　車輛加油量核減　汽油不致再恐慌</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕上月份本市汽油恐慌情形成為嚴重社會問題之一，茲者七月開始，汽油供求是否能趨平衡，頗為市民所關心。記者昨訪問某汽油公司負責人，渠認為本月份可不致發生恐慌。本月汽油進口限額仍為一百五十萬加侖，與上月份相同，惟分配方面，當局將不必要之消耗减少，如小汽車准加油量已核减百分之二十，大卡車准加油量核减百分之三十，故本月份供應量仍與上月相同而需求量則相對减少，以理度之當不致再有上月之情形發出。至於飛機用汽油現時售價雖高達每加侖一百五十八萬七千元，惟最近如中航公司等减少國內飛行班次，需求减退，一月三百七十八萬加侖之供應，足可應付中國中央及民航大隊三機構之需要。雖然此數已在上月提用一部份，但現時存量至少尙可維持兩星期，同時輸出入委員會已核准一筆額外飛行汽油進口，故民航決可維持無虞云。</p>
<h3>市長奉召晉京</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕吳市長國楨，昨奉蔣總統電召，業於昨晚搭夜快車晋京，隨行者有市府交際科長張彼德，吳氏此番晋京任務，據一般推測，恐與本市物價或與吳市長之辭職有關。</p>

<p>市警察局據報本市茂名南路二六五號華懋公萬有以金鈔買賣嫌疑，特派經濟警察將該公寓全部賬冊吊局，交由上海金融管理局審核究辦。</p>
<h3>帶款超過二億　續有三起查獲</h3>
<p>昨日雖為星期例假，惟警察局，警備部，憲兵團檢查組，仍繼續在海陸空輪船碼頭，火車站，飛機場等交通要道口，檢查入口旅客，有無携帶現款超過二億元者，傳迫令存入中央銀行。據悉：共計查僅三起，均已迫令定於今日存入央行。又今日警備部各科組及警備大隊仍將分組出動，繼續監視檢查各倉庫，俾封鎖奸商乘隙移動囤積物資，以配合七日之倉庫大檢查。</p>
<h3>申報讀者助學金委員會　發表本年春季助學概況</h3>
<p>申報讀者助學金委員會，發表上屆（即三十七年度春季）辦理助學金概况如下。</p>

<h3>任桂娥暴斃疑案　其兄函證非自殺　謂無鬼崇神經失常之事</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕餘杭女子任桂娥新婚後慘斃一案，地檢處已對任夫阮炳法等以帮助自殺罪嫌提起公訴，茲據任兄本源自餘杭來函稱；「舍妹任桂娥，四月十一日在杭州與阮炳法結婚，十四日由鄙人伴同到上海，鄙人於阮宅盤桓六天，十九日＼才回家，二十一日夜即吞服金戒，計算時日，舍妹新婚後單獨在滬祗二天，所謂有鬼作崇神經失常，鄙人作伴六天，並無其事。吞服金戒，根據阮炳法親笨來信通知，係一婦女強迫舍妹吞服，（原信呈繳地檢處），一並非自殺。况自殺必有原因，舍妹訂婚結婚均出自願，新婚半月又無刺激，吞金旣係被逼，幸能不死，那會再用剪刀自刎，加之頸有布帶勒喉，衣被整齊，且阮等在警局供吞金後舍妹要求報警被阻等等疑點，尙有其他並非自殺之理由甚多，俱詳訴狀中」云云。</p>
<h3>七月份配煤價　昨經核定公佈　平均漲百分之百六十</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕醞釀多日之七月份新煤價，昨日終由官方正式宣佈。新價較六月份之煤價，平均漲起百分之一百六十。據燃管會張主委希為語本報記者稱，漲價事非得巳，渠為此事經多日之奔波與接洽，始作漲價之最後決定，今日（四日）方由南京趕返上海。新價統扯仍較黑市煤斤低廉一半。茲探悉各檔煤斤七月份新價如次：（以下每噸似，價格單位千元）</p>
<p>（甲）公用事業，碼頭交貨三一，七八四元。整船交貨：三一，一八四元。</p>
<p>（乙）鐵路，軍運，海軍，濬浦碼頭交貨：三二，九八四元。</p>
<p>（丙）外埠電廠，輪船，及本市公用局所轄交通攘構：甚　　三二，七、八四元。二號屑三二。九八四元·混合　三三，一八四元。一號屑三三，三八四元。二號統塊三三，六八四元。混合統塊三三，九八四元。火車統塊三四，二八四元，二一號篩塊三四，五八四元。混合篩塊三四，八八四元。</p>
<p>（丁）工廠及軍政機關：基隆屑三六，三八四元。二號屑三六，五八四元。混合屑三六，七八四元。一號屑三六，九八四元。二號統塊三七，二八四元。混合統塊三七，五八四元。火車統塊三七，八八四元。二號篩塊三八，一八四元。混合篩塊三八，四八四元。</p>
<p>（戊）國外煤斤：公用事業煤屑三八，六八八元。煤槐四二，三八〇元。工廠煤屑四三，四九八元。煤槐四八，一〇〇元。</p>
<p>（己）白煤：長城屑一六，六九二元。長城塊二三，二一八元。其他煤屑二六，〇一一六元。其他小子三〇，六〇二元。其他篩塊四六，一五〇元。又丙丁戊己煤價均係浦東碼頭交貨，麥根路棧房交貨一律每噸加二四〇萬元。，</p>
<p>燃管會主委說明　不得不調整原因</p>
<p>又張希為氏為七月份煤斤　數新價、發表書面說明如次：「煤價自六月一日起，已維持一月，未予調整。而六月中各項物價，以以及生活指數，無不激漲。煤價如不再予以調整，不但礦方無法生產，即運輸起艙等工作，亦將停頓。例如開　煤，六月份秦島島交貨價，為每噸六百七十七萬八千元。除去由礦區至港口之鐵　運費一百二十二萬元（以煤易運），如以目前之外匯計算，則每噸僅及美金二元餘。以黑市美鈔計，則僅值美金一元餘。即依六月底麵粉價格計算·得噸煤亦僅能換得麵粉一袋餘。不予調整，實難繼續生產。再就六月份本會之配價言，公用事業之配價，為一千二百二十五萬五千元，除礦價六百七十七萬八千元外，其餘如輪船運費保險費上下力等，亦均須予以調整，始能辦理。礦價調整後，華北自衛特捐及印花稅等，亦均隨之增加。由秦皇島至滬之一般貨運，已漲至每噸七百三十餘萬元，故燃煤運費。亦不能不提高至每噸五百萬元，上下力　，以來價激漲，要求加薪，數度醞釀罷工，均經設法勸止。但工人生活指數，旣已提高，工資自亦不能不予以增加。所以燃煤配價，自亦無法不漲。但調聲後之價格，如以二噸煤價與一噸燃油之價格相較，則煤價尙遠較油價為低廉。如與外國煤相較，則更屬低廉。因外煤進口，加上關稅，其價格須在三十美金以上，每噸合法幣七千餘萬元。故希望管制各　，能增加生產，北　路能早日修復，開灤煤源源南運，以供應京滬一帶之需要。</p>
<p>八千餘噸臺煤運滬</p>
<p>台煤運滬量增加聲中，昨晨又有八千五百噸來滬供應，燃管會昨已派員接收卸貨，本月份內尙可運到十餘萬噸云。</p>

<p>〔本報西安一日航訊〕記者在隴東走過的地方，人們一提起八二師，幾乎都馬上會顯出親切和高興，以談到馬繼援，他們就一致的向你推薦，訴說着馬師長的好處。道裏眾民才眞正的比較合作。提到軍隊紀律的時候，他們都說；這隊伍好，公買公賣，不住民房，不擾百姓。」馬繼援不是一個傳奇式的英雄　他是個廿八歲的少年將軍。他是靑海主席馬步芳先生的獨子，從他生命史的第一頁起，直到現在，他是一帆風順，中國的西北角，早在十年前，就有許多人知道他，而在這一次隴東大捷之後，他才名揚國內，被人注意。</p>
<p>民國三十三年，是他生命史上一個大轉捩點　一個久居西北的靑年公子，第一次從重慶陸大將官班甲級一期畢業，這對他後來的新事業是一個孕育時期，對他後來的道路是一個新的起點。當時和他同班的人，有宋希濂·范漢傑·黃釗和現在共匪「西北人民解放軍副總司令」趙壽山等，據他自己說，在那一班中，他是成績最壞的學生。從陸大畢業後，他再回到他的隊伍中，開始着手改革軍隊中的小事。</p>
<p>當五月廿三日，記者第一次到他的司令部去訪問他時，他迎接大家，到他的辦公室　坐下。那是雨間大的房子，四壁上掛着軍用地圖和于髯翁的條幅，倒是風雅有緻，中間雜着幾塊小紙塊，用仿宋體寫着西洋的格言，如「天才決不蔑視勞動！——斯蒂文斯。」等，桌子上放着幾張陳報，中間有兩三本Silren　Screen，這都充分的表示着主人對西洋風味，也是深深的愛好着。在那次禮節性的拜會中，雖然只談了幾十分鐘，可是大家談得很融洽。他穿着黃呢軍裝，說着一口十足的甘肅腔。</p>
<p>第二天下午，他和大家在一起拉起閒話，據他自己說：是喜歡騎馬，打獵，過去是非常愛讀屠格湼夫的小說，現在興趣轉移到國家！他是一個電影迷，他說，有好久沒有着過電影，在重慶的時候，他一天可以趕看三場。同時，他是很愛唱歌的，每夜在計劃作戰以後，他和他的高級部屬，引吭高歌。他能唱西洋歌曲，愛跳風土舞。什麼使他愛好這些呢？應該是幼年時代的貴族生活，與回族的民族性罷。說到他的家庭生活　他就笑了。他的太太們現住西寗，大太太是他的表妹現駐新疆騎兵某部馬師長的嫡親妹妹，他們是少年訂婚，父母主持。她不認識字，馬繼援笑着說：有一次，我給她去信，問他為啥給我不來信，結果回信來了，是信封寫字，信箋空白，只在左下角，蓋了一個章。他在重慶時，和一個外匯管理委員會的女職員張訓芬戀愛，後來結婚，張夫人是南京籍，匯文女中畢業，現在也住在西寗。記者問他愛那一個，他說「都愛」。有另一位記者從旁敲擊，問他回家去先到那個閨房，他巧妙的說：「先到我母親那裏，因為她兩個都在那裏一。這話使大家都笑起來。「十官九怕」，他繼續說下去：「我也是聽太太話的。像在一個月以前，我忽然想到應該留鬍髭了，於是就留下了撮八字鬍。寫信告訴張太太，並附小照一張，作為證明。太太馬上下了「訓令」，不同意這事，我就遵命剃去，又年靑了」。</p>
<p>他說：他喜歡美國，贊成民生，討厭蘇聯，認為有一天蘇聯會和美國打起來，他同意一位外籍同業的詢問「有人類，就有戰爭」一說。</p>
<p>隴東大捷，是共匪在靈山失敗之後，想回師北上，擊敗馬部，以飾其敗績。馬繼援不能不承認這次若不是胡宗南將軍所部尾追北上，他將吃更大的虧，可是假如隴東沒有他們堵擊，共匪會跑掉得更多些。</p>
<p>國軍八十二師，是馬步芳一手訓練培養出來的。十數年來聞名西北。民二十四年曾消滅過四萬多個共匪，擊破了徐向前的「國際路綫」的打通。當馬繼援廿一歲時，就出任軍長承受了他父親的衣缽，勝利後，奉命改編，他由軍長，編為師長，除換了名稱以外，原人原馬，不但是沒換藥，恐怕連湯也沒換。</p>
<h3>修築蘇滬塘工　三期工款撥到</h3>
<p>〔本報鎭江三日訊〕蘇滬海塘修築工程今年應進行第三期計劃，共長七〇六公尺，據蘇建應消息：第一批工款三百億五月間撥到後，即與福記營造廠訂約購料，第二批七百億，六月間業由美援華曾撥到上海，刻正籌劃松江·太倉兩段工程，第三批工款一千三百億，正在洽領中。蘇建廳董贊堯前赴寶山等段視察，二日返鎭，據談：「工程進行，每因受物價彼動，不易控制，現正設法以預計工數為標準，按照實際需要撥發工款。</p>
<h3>鐵腕政治在浙江　從沈成章到陳公洽</h3>
<p>— 本報特派員　儲裕生</p>
<p>〔本報杭州三日訊〕江南的五月，榴花如火，正在步向盛夏的時候，浙江省政府主席沈成章氏辭職照准，換來了陳公洽氏，自有一番送舊迎新的氣象。</p>
<p>回憶沈氏在將就任的前夕，對記者談：「浙江是一個健全的省，一切都上了軌道，所以也比較易於治理」。但是沈氏來浙兩年餘，又萌了退志，他曾對記者說：「本來喜歡飲酒，現在酒不喝了，本來喜歡抽姻，姻也不抽了，近來連睡眠也睡不好，知道賤軀巳在退步」。沈氏上任的時候，也曾對記者說：「我巳是六十開外的人了，蔣總統要我來治理他的家鄉，惟有拼力為之，以報知遇」。</p>
<p>沈氏在浙的時日中，他本人真可談得上「勤政」，下車伊始，就去海塘視察，以後一直在各縣跑，差不多每一個縣都留過他的足跡，雖道路傾圯，亦在十輪大上大車上顛簸以行，抵每一縣時，視察各機關，舉行座談會，至深夜二時始睡，翌晨七時又起來工作，這種精神，以他現在六十六歲的高齡，實在堪稱難得。</p>
<p>沈氏的工作重心，似對每一種事業均予以普遍的注意，譬如吏治，他就主張廢苛雜攤派，不招待上司與外賓，即自己巡抵縣治，也自己出錢買飯。如對建設，海塘的與修，農田水利的舉辦，造林·造產等，各項工作，都着着進行。如對治安，規定省保安團隊的防區，劃定四明等地為綏塘區，召集綏靖區的縣長，計劃保安工作。如對人事，由省幹部訓練團訓練人才，縣長舉行考試與登記。對財政田賦，向中央請求核减賦率，力爭增加經費等。對敎育·防範學潮·到處對學生講話。對縣級公敎人員待遇，提高至發給實物和規定公務員的基本薪津。沈氏在職期間，其</p>
<p>最著成效者，莫如建設方面的農田水利，那時正巧行總在浙設有分署，沈氏則到處奔波，巡察需要興修水利的縣份，兩相配合，以麵粉為工賑，確確實實做了不少的事。至於沈氏比較的受到非難的，要算治安問題，因為沈氏下車時，治安問題並不感到嚴重，但時至今日，却感到很多威脅性。因此，聽說沈氏在南京時，受到很多同鄉的責問。</p>
<p>其實，治安的問題關繫於整個的政治問題，因為整個政治上沒有拿出快刀斬亂麻的辦法來，再加以物價騰漲，人民生計為難，祗要稍一煽動，雖星星之火，亦必燎原。所以如果在這幾個比較難治而治安有問題的地方，能够給予人民以安定的生計，人心自然厭亂。我覺得批評沈氏對洽安沒有痛下功夫，事實上有些寃枉，我以為沈氏之失，乃失在對每一椿事業都加以普遍的注意，而且事必躬親。因為對每一椿事都注意了，缺乏對一專題特別解決的辦法，對每事事必躬親了，人的精力總是有限的，就會使自己感到疲勞辛苦，人一到疲勞辛苦，就只有拖的力量了。有人說，沈氏來浙，任用私人很多，我覺得此話也不免言過其實，沈氏下車後組府，幾位省委不合作，又奔往南京，東西拉攏，始成省府，同時，在全省各縣縣長中，眞是沈氏私人的，到底還是少數。沈氏是想在浙江幹一番事業的，是想在好的方向做去的，所以他不願得罪人，總想法使人人痛快，問題也就在這個上面，因為想不得罪人，就偏要得罪人了。有許多人的感覺，覺得沈氏治浙兩年，沒有覺得他的好處，也沒有覺得他的壞處。</p>
<p>現在陳公俠氏來了，陳氏下車後就對記者表示：將特別着重於治安與生產兩方面。在治安與生產中，他對於後者，似特別憲着興趣，有一幅</p>
<p>美麗圖案，即是街口的水力發電成功，浙贛路由金華通往溫州，錢塘江正式通航，則經濟情形一定可以改觀。誠然，今日我們談治安，如果剛以兵力鬥勝，這實在是消極的，我們應該以發展經濟事業，充裕人民生計，使人人有飯吃，有衣穿，這才算是積極的治安工作。現在，陳氏所列舉的水力發電，錢江通航，貫通金溫鐵道，都已有具體的雛型，只要堅忍不拔，努力以赴，當然可以成功的。不過，要成功上述幾椿事業，需用大量金錢與人力。陳氏曾表示到浙以後，要征用游力與游資，這當然為一般人所歡迎的，因為减少游力，就是减少消費，减少游資，簡接抑平物價，但是今天有游力游資的大半都是有錢有勢的人，眞正的老百姓，如農村中的農胞是已經到了出錢出力的地步，如果陳氏要征用游力游資，會不會使一些有錢有勢的人發生惡感，我們素仰於陳氏的鐵腕政治，他旣經決定，就篤實以行，不顧一切艱難，務必貫澈到底。我們熱切盼望着新來的主席，要用快刀斬亂麻的手段，切切實實的幹一番，庶幾這浙江眞正得到「治平」的一天。</p>
<h3>國產影片水準提高　可能爭取海外市場</h3>
<p>〔本報香港二日航訊〕香港專映一首輪四片之King's戲院，自昨日起以倍於陳列外國影片劇照之地位，懸掛國產古裝片「國魂」二十四寸大之五彩照片，於其最觸目之走廊中，並有即將於該院獻影之預告字句，以是頗引起此間中西人士之興趣。據電影界人士之觀察：認為中國電影可能即將在國際市塲抬頭，問題在於國產片之技術水準，是否能媲美好萊塢之出品，而攝製「國魂」之永華影業公司，似巳具有上述基本條件。</p>
<h3>常熟兩匪犯　圖逃遭格斃</h3>
<p>〔本報常熟十二日訊〕虞澄區消剿指揮部，在東鄉先後捕獲通匪犯徐永根，徐金輝（即陸小康之姘婦）等兩名口，訊供自願領提匪徒包堃材，於前晚派員隨赴箕衣港時，不意行至梅李鎭第九保地方，該兩犯乘夜色昏暗，竟向前猛撲，企圖脫逃，追捕不及，遂開槍警告，適中要害，當塲斃命。</p>
<h3>瀋陽一血案　訂婚席上橫禍飛來　仇殺情殺費疑猜</h3>
<p>〔本報瀋陽卅日航訊〕潘陽近來兇案特多，正表示着一般靑年男女的心理在向畸形的道路發展。今天下午二時許，北市塲泰豐樓發生一樁撲朔迷離的兇殺案，女主角是芳齡十九歲的村姑邱喜淸，姿色可人，一顆手榴彈在她的訂婚筵席上開了花，她原定本星期日結婚，這是她沒有夢到的噩運，在一桌筵席上，人生發展到喜劇和悲劇兩個極端的高潮。</p>
<p>兇手是廿餘歲的軍人，長髮，面色蒼白，他殺人之後，復以手榴彈自殺，肺臟外溢　血肉橫飛，他這樣模仿英勇式的死了，他們都盲目的死了。記者擠進人羣看這幕悲劇時，只見血肉糢糊的四具屍身，前排的人表情都很肅靜，這正是人類的象徵，在那所謂「人生」的暴風雨後，一切歸於靜止和沉默。</p>
<p>這情節離奇的故事，發生在雨霏霏的中午，泰豐樓來了一位軍人顧客，上樓入第四號座，要冷葷一盤，白酒一疑，獨自豪飲，繼索上好酒菜，情似澆愁。一時許，喚茶房來，謂將趕三時火車他往，現暫小睡，屆時呼渠醒，旋似入睡狀態。</p>
<p>原來該樓第二，第三號座間，時有住撫順之東北守備總隊第二團衛生隊少校主任劉漢文，（廿七歲，錦州人）與沙河鄉吳家堡村女邱喜淸（十九歲）正舉行訂婚儀式，雙方親屬到有十餘人，不意喜宴甫畢，橫禍突來，鄰座軍人以手榴彈一枚由門外投入，轟然一聲，硝烟飛揚，該軍人復返座，自爆身亡。</p>
<p>事發後，飯館主人急奔報警，憲警趕到後，即處置善後，開始偵察地院檢查處，亦派檢察官及法醫勘騐，判明死者邱喜淸（女），王富奎（係女之姊丈），田子文，係劉漢文之勤務兵，及兇手四人。傷者有媒人吳王如蘭（女），劉漢文，徐恩才（泰豐樓茶房），均傷及臂腿部份，係輕傷已送入醫院。</p>
<p>此案情節，壼似妬殺仇殺，據聞泰豐樓是日另有一桌訂婚宴，兇手酒後神志不淸，亦有誤殺可能。惟該行兇軍人未佩符號，無從知其所屬部隊及姓名，頗難尋獲綫索。據說該女在家鄉時，家中曾駐有軍隊，已露蛛絲馬跡，似為桃色糾紛。</p>
<p>女父邱文漢，是一個老實的鄉下人，經此劇變，精神已失常，但他反復地說：女兒是很規矩的，生前並無不規情事。經法醫檢查，少女已非處女時，這鄉下老頭堅決否認，但在他失神的眼睛裏已流露比女兒之死更羞辱的悲哀。</p>

<h3>常州糧政　一團糟·漏洞多</h3>
<p>〔本報武進二日訊〕過去，田賦征實，地方一般人士對之，竟像一個「謎」。倉耗，儲耗，運耗，漏耗，船耗……弄不淸楚的許多「耗子」長程運費·短程運費，加工成率，加工餘米·集中倉庫粳，秈，客稻，紅斑米，霉爛榖，上下力，麻袋，糧串，結單，那樣多的麻煩，誰也搞得傷腦筋！</p>
<p>常州，在深受痛苦的敎訓後，不甘願對這個「謎」不打開一看。於是乎輿論上注意，參議會特組織一個淸查會，歷時三四個月，多方查詢，竟把這個神秘腫瘤開了一刀。剖視之，出人意表的，全是潰爛的東西，眞正是一團糟！</p>
<p>淸查第一聲　探驪得珠，首先就覺湛橋辦事處的賦榖，由縣田糧處秘書兼三科科長盧品瑾憑藉職務上便利，同時又為縣長翁檉私人關係，密屬倉庫管理員將糧四千四百餘石運往無錫太亨糧行加工，訂明每石一〇八斤成米八十二斤合為五斗四升七合，表面上由常州振興協劃賬。當查獲時，糙粳二百包，白粳九百卅餘包已運出，據說白粳是出籠上市，販賣牟利。此事完全違法，經檢舉後，省田糧處亦派員查明屬實，盧品瑾及一部份運累職員，先後瑯璫入獄。主犯盧品瑾靠了卸任縣長翁檉說情的關係，假稱保外辦移交，保出後，就潛逃無踪，現在更連累了保人。案子尙待那個法院審究中。一般老百姓的看法，中國的法洽不够勁，</p>
<p>「官官相護」，不會有什麼結果的。事情剛剛開頭，民情已預感「雷聲大，雨點小」的失望了。惟是這個盧品瑾跟了翁檉八九年，專辦糧政，參透了糧政三昧，門檻路路精通。這次在常，滿想「瞞天過海」，不料半路失風，事情一發覺，他很聰明的把責任推到辦事員身上，逃避罪責，翁檉居然也代他叫寃，但是親筆的證據握在人家手裏，事跡顯然，也不容狡辯，不得已還是「三十六着，逃為上策」了。參會決進一步的淸查，不幸的，這個盧品瑾，這一次失風了。</p>
<p>其二又是漕橋辦事處職員壽學範，也是翁縣長帶來的人，先後押運賦榖來城，解晋豐米廠共一千四百餘石，</p>
<p>鄉間老百姓繳的全為粳稻，到廠登賬悉變為秈稻。那時市價，粳稻貴，秈稻賤，差價每石在十萬元以上。幾億元的中飽，輕而易舉。同時，壽為一少年，舉止闊綽，揮霍成性，利用職權，又挪用賦榖二百餘石。事發，壽一度被拘押，旋又在解法院途中脫逃了。此案也要待法院來審理。從這兒就說明了許多道理：（一）田糧處及各辦事處一過往硬要老百姓儘量完粳稻，粳秈易手，差價在全縣幾十萬石的總數下，是個不小的數目。（二）老百姓無諭粳秈，品質一律是不得差的，再從優良的品質，變為紅斑低劣的碎米，每石差價也在一二十萬元上下。這個上下其手，也是大利所在。但說起來，米還是米，担數還是担數，公事上毫無問題。倒霉的眞是壽學範，被檢舉了。</p>
<p>加工廠商和特約倉庫的毛病也正不輕，常州特約倉庫有同仁，源豐，大豐，天豐，恒豐，楊大生，裕源成，振興協等二十餘家，最近發覺天豐，恒豐，兩廠，挪虧賦榖共四千六七百石，天豐經理，戴學愚完全賣空買空，勾結了</p>
<p>糧官盧品瑾拿賦榖來設天豐廠號，拿賦榖來經營雲飛運輸公司，拿賦榖到無錫去開辦天豐祥糧行，七七八八」陣子，孰料時運不濟，虧耗賦榖二千五百餘石，現在本人已瑯璫入獄，訊詞答應願破產賠償，這件事牽涉當然甚廣，軍法室尙在繼續審訊中。同樣恒豐廠挪用一千二百石，查有實據，現在負責人金震一，交保候訊。他對外聲稱已補足了。究竟補足與否，還待盤廠後明白，其他的廠有無挪用？沒有詳查，但至少運用是免不了的。</p>
<p>其次是加工成率，和加餘米也是黑幕重重。照規定每石榖一〇八斤，加工得米至少不低於五斗二升，以礱糠，粞糠充作加工工本費和短程運費，按照一般慣例，一〇八斤加工成米，可得五斗四五升，除規定五斗二升外，至少每石穀可得餘米二三升，幾十萬石的加工，這餘米也是成千成石，不是小數，可是在官貪吏污商奸民邪沆瀣一氣互相勾結下，他們對外就宣佈只有五斗二升，據統計常州三十五·三十六兩年度的加工餘米，至少在一萬石以上。時值以每石一千五百萬算，數目在一千五百億元。這是無數老百姓的血汗錢，全被侵吞了，誰侵吞，當然囉，牽涉很廣，與糧有關係的諸色人等，誰也免不了惹着腥羶。</p>
<p>老百姓對完納賦榖是吃盡苦頭的。催徵吏急於星火，必要時什麼什麼隊會帮同出動。</p>
<p>完納的賦穀　一要乾燥，二要飽綻，三要質良，假使夾點砂泥瀋殻，絲毫不能通融，過秤時，秤梢至少要像蜻蜓尾巴那樣掀起，浮秤一二斤，絲毫不易覺察。還要公開的增加每石七八斤五六斤不等，假定交錢，照良榖市價外，也得多添五六斤七八斤的錢。還要呌你送到指定的集中倉庫去，苛刻剝削，誅求無厭，極盡貪污能事。去年冬天，常州有個老百姓為了解糧，遭遇到</p>
<p>最悲慘遭遇　挑了一石榖子，自奔牛送到城，而辦事已過辦公時間，拒不收受，那個鄉下老百姓，在城舉目無親，身上又無分文，不得已看守着一担榖子，在倉庫門口，忍飢耐寒，凍過了嚴冬的一夜，翌日返家，終因受傷過重，不三日就丟下來妻子見女，默默地逝世了！你能沒有感想麼？此外尙有不知多少的血淚故事，都在這不良的徵實糧政策略下產生，也不能一一盡舉。賣田究糧，隨處可以聽到，眞敎人不忍卒聽。</p>
<p>目下現行的糧政，實在漏洞太多了！譬如低價收購地方縣級賦榖，毫無情義的收購，給價不到市價五分之一。縣級賦穀被廉購一空，置縣財政死活於不顧。縣經費在江南各縣，一般情形，六七八九月份經費都落了空，民窮財盡，而戡亂建國事不可不做，然而因為沒有錢，一切也就洩了氣。關於田賦征實，運費規定的不合情理，譽如三十六年度的運費每石不過幾千元的數目，試問如何可以呌人搬運？儲耗，倉耗，運耗，一切的一切·應該有的開銷付給，並非不可有精確的統計，作合理合法合情的科學管理。無奈糧政當局，毫無正確的指示，僅憑命令，怎麼怎麼，有許多地方呌下級工作人員要不舞弊亦不可能！這怎麼行？</p>
<p>卅七年征實　又將開始，假定在制度上不澈底改弦更張，力求革新，原一仍舊觀，那麼，當然有多少的糧官賦吏將在獰笑，歡迎這發財機會來臨，多少的糧商們在發笑，舞爪弄牙，乘機勾結攅營這賺錢生意。可憐的老百姓又要發抖了！我們的看法，一般的說法，今日糧政太難了，節節有弊，層層有病，弊病相連相結，現階段的糧政，簡直是個貪污舞弊的大實驗塲，在今日有幾個人能經得起考驗呢？政府倘不積極糾正，是無異驅無數的官吏胥役商民，一一引入貪污舞弊的深坑去了！其結果豈止糧政前途不堪設想，急不容緩的戡亂建國，民主行憲，恐也不會有什麼紀錄可寫。</p>

<h3>一般物價　經濟危機日深　當局力謀挽救</h3>
<p>六月的大漲風，驚濱駭浪，延續連四週之久。截至上週，似又暫入休止狀態，據分析不外下列數因：（一）物價經連續猛漲後，游資凍結於物資上，持貨者不願脫手，游資無法蠢動；（二）外埠物價亦上漲過猛，游資為物資所吸收，來源减少；（三）華北限制兌換流通劵，南流資金减少。</p>
<p>上週因屆六底，七月一二兩日，又為各行莊上半年總決算之期，頭寸必須軋齊，主要商品，多屬無市，，故整個市塲，除股市於三日開出為滿堂紅外，餘較為沉寂，無多足述者，惟通貨不斷膨脹，經濟危機，日形餒重，大家對於週末紅盤開出後之物價趨勢，憂心惴惴耳。</p>
<p>這一次物價的瘋在漲風，當局亦為之駭倒，在重要措施方面，可得而述者如次：</p>
<p>第一，最先監察院感於物價的在漲，亟須制止，於六月十六日向行政院提出物價糾正案，待至上週一政院提出答復，列舉平抑措施：</p>
<p>（一）加强金融管制，防止濫發本票，以免信用膨脹，刺激物價。</p>
<p>（二）推銷國庫券，抽緊銀根。</p>
<p>（三）派遺負責人員趕赴華北，改善匯兌辦法，及在華北拋售物資，并飭由糧食部頒訂調濟民食緊急措施辦法，訂購洋米，繼續舉辦都市配售食量，以安定社會人心。</p>
<p>上面這寥寥的幾條，　說是舊話重提，對於當前的物價問題，毫無新的辦法。</p>
<p>第二，週二行政院張副院長稱：「政府物價之管制，目前係由有關部會就所屬性質，分別管制，如花管會·金管局等，現政府有鑒於目前物價波動甚劇，已令各主管部門，將原有辦法加强實施管制，并詳擬意見呈報，俾政院此後對全面管制，得以隨時配合運用。」嗣傳翁院長已擬訂穩定物價具體辦法，於週末在立院秘密會議中提出報告，山窮水盡的物價問題，究竟如何解決，試拭目以待新辦法的實施吧！第三，滬市當局對物價上漲措施，於廿六日在市府召開會議，宣佈四項緊急措施立即實施：（一）令飭本市糧食·棉花·紗布·食油·燃料·紙張·食糖等日用品同業公會，在三天內將其各會員商號，自本月十五日起至報告日止期間之交易情形，包括交易數量，承購人或商號姓名，價格等，窠報社會局，備作查考。</p>
<p>（二）令飭本市倉庫堆棧業同業公會，造冊　報谷倉庫日用必需品所儲存之戶名，數量，堆存日期。市府將加澈查，如有業外人經營者，及儲存貨物超過政府規定時間者，將予嚴辦。</p>
<p>（三）由金融管理局召集市政府，社會局，警察局，中央銀行稽核處等，澈查票據交換所，各行莊票據之來蹤去跡，如有利用款項，囤集居奇投機操縱者，或挪用公款者，將予嚴辦。</p>
<p>（四）本市棉花存底有十五萬包，計紡織品外銷委員會有五萬七千包，美援物資中有九萬包，現正向外銷委會洽商，擬蔣此批棉花配售，對美援部份亦在設法動用中，故目前棉花恐慌可以解除。在此項決定後，聞已逐漸付諸實施，至今後結果如何，尙有待事實的證明。</p>
<p>第四，過去當局的拋售物資政策，向來多集中在上海一地，上週一起，當局已首次在犬津拋售麵粉一千八百餘袋，價每袋六百五十萬至九百四十萬，另拋售漢口米二千餘斤。隨後繼續拋售，聞截至週末，拋粉共七千袋。拋售物資對於平抑物價自然有決定性的作用，但根據上海拋售的經騐，倘不能控制足量的物價，制訂平穩的價格，再加之拔術運用的不當，有時反引誘投機家的念頭，助長物價的上漲，這是外埠拋售物資似應考慮的。</p>
<p>第五，滬市當局為防止三日紅盤開出後物價再漲起見，週五由警備部宣司令，邀集本市政軍警憲金融各機關首長會商，決定緊急辦法五項：</p>
<p>（一）控制通貨緊縮信用，要點約為限制每人來滬携帶現鈔不得超過二億元，并建議中央銀行限制提存。</p>
<p>（二）管制物價搜查囤貨，限期登記存貨并檢查倉庫。</p>
<p>（三）食糧公賣，平抑米價，加速籌備糧食公費并實施全面配給。</p>
<p>（四）取締證劵塲外交易，維護傷內正常交易。</p>
<p>（五）密查各業投機操縱份子，查獲後除特別重要的，另定處分辦法外，一般犯也要送特種刑庭辦理。平抑物價需要訴諸警憲的力煩，　是一種緊急的局面，或可收效於一時，但是危機絕不能根本解除，所以如何善為疏導，以圖挽救，應是中德當局迫不及待的責任，也是內閣成敗的關鍵所在，</p>

<h3>貨幣金融</h3>
<p>（一）銀行暗</p>
<p>上週週三，乃六月中最後一天，週四週五兩大，為銀錢業上半年總結賬後的例假日，故本期貨幣金融　取材，只到週三為止。</p>
<p>上週時屆六底，不但本市銀錢業期逢大比，即其他都市銀錢各業，亦須作此半年一度的結算。因之本埠搜羅頭寸者固　殷切，外埠游資亦鮮有抵達，上週本市銀根告緊，當以此為主因。</p>
<p>先就暗息而言，上週週一在三角三分與三角四分半之問，週二升至三角六分，週三則有高至四角半者，頭寸之吃香，巳可樓見。至於證券帮塲外貼息，亦約站五角左右之高　。</p>
<p>國家行局庫自週一至週三之差進總額為二萬三千一百四十六億，如扣除同期內商業銀行於央行之定存存約九千億，行局之實進亦達一萬四千餘億。</p>
<p>洋商銀行一週來，維持高額之鉅進，自週一至週三不過三天，即差進二萬二千六百二十六億，資金之去路頗堪注目。</p>
<p>（二）內外匯率</p>
<p>上週外匯行市，港匯仍見短縮，法幣十萬元計合港幣一角四分，香港美鈔市價在五元四角四五分之間，黃金每華兩計國幣三百二十一元。結匯證明書續見上昂，前週末不過一百四十六萬元，上週週一巳至一百八十五萬，週二週三則已高叩二百萬關。</p>
<p>本市行莊內匯匯率，穗匯受盛傳當局開放華南匯兌影響，其匯水竟自前週末之二百五十元提至上週初之四百元，週二雖回降至三百五十元，但週三又昂至四百元，資金轉移外埠之現象明顯。</p>
<p>厦門匯水，週一週二為八十元，週三亦提至一百元，俞匯週一為平匯，週二為二十元，週三升至三十元。漢匯匯水自週一之一百八十元，升至週三之二百元。津匯因傳東北流通劵停兌，與華北開放申匯關係，貼水自週一之一百元减為二十元，但週三津匯貼水，又回升至五十元，由此亦可測資金南來之衆多。</p>
<p>商業行莊方面，缺單普遍，同業拆放紛繁現鈔更見缺乏，六十號以後行莊，交換結果，三天內亦有四萬二千六百多億之差出，銀根俏　，又傳一證明。</p>
<p>（三）華洋股市</p>
<p>週初因銀根傳緊，且聞當局有抑平物價之四項新措置，人心不無警惕，永紗初開，遽落至四九五〇元，幾經盤升，終以五二四〇元收市。美亞第一天開做新股，漲達一八五元。麗安亦是新股上市，做至十七元漲停板。餘均較上週　降。</p>
<p>週二因六底迫近，且逢證交休假三天，浮多不堪利息負担，逢高紛紛拋售，市勢乃呈欲漲乏力之勢，永紗竟日低檔徘徊，降至五千二百三十元收市。冷門股中之中衣，麗安，華新，新華等四種，均叩漲限。</p>
<p>週三適逢六底，為證交本年份上半屆會計年度，按照規定，本日停止交易，七月一二兩日，為各業結　，銀行休假，亦無交易。</p>
<p>週未紅盤開出，利多消息紛傳，人心亢奮異常，各股全登漲限，竟告滿堂紅。</p>
<p>外股週初開市，因近月杪，銀根漸緊，港匯亦平，洋股一致回小，怡紗退至一千一百萬元，會德　叩三千萬關。英聯較上週軋低一百九十萬元，業廣尙平。</p>
<p>週二因報載當局禁止洋股交易，人心均持觀望，午前廷至十一時始有成交，市勢一致趨疲，怡紗回至一千零六十萬元。英聯喊價一千一百五十萬，會德豐破入三千萬大　，二千九百萬有成交</p>
<p>週三為六月　，與華股市塲相同，依往例休息，七月一二兩日為半年總結算之期，亦無父易。</p>
<h3>美國桐油產量激增</h3>
<p>〔紐約航訊〕桐油生產事業，已逐漸成為美國重要企業之一，過去美國所植桐樹，大多偏於東南諸州之童山，現在各該地所有桐樹，均巳茁壯成蔭，其每年所產桐果，總以萬千噸計。以較三四十年前，高不盈尺之幼苗，初自中國移植美國時，情况則已大異。</p>
<p>當時美國各有關公司，曾以興奮情緒，應購地皮，截種此種來自中國之桐樹幼苗，同時並慫慂投資家予以經濟上之支持，然而實驗成效不佳，終歸失敗。蓋其所植之桐樹，生長速度毫不彰著，而其週圍之莠草則反廣繁茂，因是經營者，多放棄原來計劃，不願培植施肥，一任其自生自滅</p>
<p>無何，對新興工業具有信念之少數投資家，為圖彌補其經濟上之捐失，乃起而利用更為科學之方法，加以培植，由於渠等加倍之努力經營，西南密西西比流域一帶之乾燥土壤上，乃乍見成蔭之桐林矣。</p>
<p>最近桐油商人，曾在美國密西西比海灣港，召開桐油公會會議，主席蓋哀德曾提出報告謂：</p>
<p>今年桐油產量已較去年增加百分之二二，雖然目前尙需各方面之協助，但桐油業已在向前邁進中。</p>
<p>桐油在工業方面，用途極多，舉凡油漆。搪瓷·噴漆·電氣·絕綠·防水·汽車·剎車帶·肥皂等，均可採作原料，此外並可用為塡塞，鉛質飛機翼上孔隙之用，因其所具之强力乾燥性，為所有他種乾性油所不及。</p>
<p>美國植桐區，現在擴展至六個州，由喬治亞，偉胃里蓬至亞拉巴馬，密西西比，路易西安那以迄德克薩迤東一帶。</p>
<p>去年美國桐油業所遭遇之困難，其中之一厥為中國貨因無關稅限制大量進口，美國油商公會不斷向美政府請求協助，即對中國輸往美國之桐油，每磅征收進口稅美金二分半，以期限制中國桐油在美之銷路，現在桐油征稅法案已經美國政府駁回，並取消海關前此對我桐油輸入索取保證金之辦法云。</p>
<p>一九四八年美國桐菓收成，估計約為九萬噸。</p>
<h3>三年來蠶絲產量　逐年均見增加</h3>
<p>據蠶絲協導會息：勝利以後，中蠶公司及蠶協會先後輔導蠶絲事業之推進，巳歷三年。經各省之共同努力，蠶絲產額逐年均見增加。三十五年度由政府貸款繅製生絲數量，計春絲六三四五担，另烘繭絲六六七担，秋絲三二五担，共計七三三七担，其他各地土絲產量約共一萬二千餘担，總計二萬担左右。</p>
<p>三十六年度政府貸款繅製之春絲，計九一七四，秋絲四九担，自款繅製之生絲約五百担，土絲約九千担，另烘繭絲約二千担，總計在二萬一千担之譜。</p>
<p>本年度春貸　，連同合作社兩繅絲，約計二一〇〇〇担，土絲約計一五〇〇〇担，烘繭絲約四〇〇〇祖，約計可產三萬一千祖，本年秋繭尙未計入。外傳本年產絲四十二萬担，實屬傳聞失實，即產絲最豐之日本，年產亦不過二十萬祖之譜云。</p>

<h3>公展杯籃球總決賽　新建榮獲冠軍　四二比二九擊敗約翰　七日上午舉行給獎式</h3>
<p>市體育館為提倡中學籃球運動促進競賽興趣起見，主辦公展盃中等學校籃球聯賽，自四月下旬展幕以來，先舉行分組比賽，計男子部十一組，女子部兩組，每組大部分為五隊，共六十八隊，經兩月之競賽角逐，全部分組冠軍次第產生，最近三週舉行總決賽，男子部採淘汰制，女子部採三賽兩勝制，女部冠軍已為民立女中獲得，昨日下午二時為男子組新建與約翰兩隊標戰，觀者數逾千人，一部份觀衆擅入籃球房，影響比賽，經勸導退出，延至二時三刻始進行比賽，兩校啦啦隊助威，空氣十分緊張，結果新建以四十二比二十九勝約翰，奪得錦標，盃賽戰程全部結東，定於本月七日上午九時，在該館舉行之市立中學聯合畢業典禮時，舉行給獎式，屆時請潘議長親臨發給，錦標獎品除大銀盃兩座外，尙有全國體育用品號贈送大號錦旗兩面，有六日起該館發還參加球隊保證金，並分贈盃賽紀念章。</p>
<p>新建一路居先</p>
<p>二時三刻開賽　，劉荷生執法，新建張乃豪首破籃圈，先得兩分，綱之徐叔沅犯規，約翰胡惠充罰而未中，新建吳漢文建功，馬津生回敬，四比二新建前導，一路順風。至九比四，約翰呼停，以丁鐵入替白先恒，然未見效。漢文得點，張乃豪擲罰俱中，十三比四，約翰落後益多，諸將急自振作，果見均炳惠充津生相繼獲中，十比十五接近。新也此時，豈容放縱，漢文一罰，錦標探中，成十八比十，約翰再以白先恒人傷，易出丁鐵，新建亦以釐其文換徐叔沅，約翰乘機急起，萬興海馬津生先後命中，上半時結束，十八比十四，新建佔先兩球。</p>
<p>約翰力追無效</p>
<p>易籃再戰，新建張乃豪退休，徐叔沅車行人塲，戰未多時，約翰馬津生脚抽筋兩次呼停，幸不久即態，且建首功，但新建攻勢依舊未衰，徐叔沅梁雄標頻有得分，約翰屢次換將，亦無效果。戰局已臻最尙峯，廿七比十八後，約翰汪均炳連中，馬津生長射破籃，廿四比廿七，再告接近。新建徐叔沅兩擲兩中，馬津生擲罰扳回三分，約翰至此漸呈疲態，新建諸將兇悍不减，大局遂落新建手中。迨法定時間完畢，新建以四二比廿九勝約翰，奪得公展盃男子部總冠軍，約翰退居總亞軍。</p>

<p>〔路透社惠勃爾登三日電〕二十五歲之金髮全美女子網球單打冠軍白露小姐，今日在惠勃爾登決賽中，奪得單打，雙打，及混合雙打三項冠軍，躍登世界網球皇后之寶座。其對手赫德小姐，在單打，雙打，混合雙打中均受挫。男子雙打，在單打打決賽中受挫於去根堡之澳洲勃朗維區，與其夥伴賽格曼，奮得雙打冠軍。勃朗維區亦與白露小姐會得混合雙打冠軍。今賽觀衆擁擠，瑪麗太后，坎特公爵夫人，艾德禮首相等，均蒞塲。</p>
<p>女子單打　決賽，白露小姐以六—一，八—六克赫德小姐，表演精彩，技術堪與惠勃爾登中央球塲歷來最佳之女子單打決賽表演相埒。赫德小姐於本屆及上屆均晋達決賽，不幸均於決賽時被欺，上屆係於決賽時敗於奧斯朋小姐（即杜邦夫人）之手，今日與白露之戰，歷時一小時半，雙方擊球均極有力，白露以擅於控制球，為其獲勝之決定性因素，然赫德每分必力爭到底。</p>
<p>女子雙打　女子雙打決賽，白露小姐與杜邦夫人以六—三，三—六，六—三克赫德小姐及杜特夫人。前者為一儿四六年之女雙打冠軍，後者則係上屆女雙打冠軍。</p>
<p>男子雙打　男子雙打勃朋維區與賽格曼，以五—七，七—五，七—五，九—七勝美國湯勃朗及莫洛埃，奪得冠軍。湯勃朗表演失常，錯誤百出，非特無助於莫洛埃，莫氏反受其控制，如湯勃朗表演正常，彼等可望得勝。蓋除第一盤由彼等以七—五獲勝外，在第三及第四盤中，亦曾分別以五比三佔優也。</p>
<p>混合雙打　混合雙打競半劇烈，勃朗維區及白露雖以六—二，三—六，六—三勝賽格曼及赫德小姐，然險象環生，勝來殊不易。</p>
<h3>摔角觀摩大會　王文鼎壓倒周松有</h3>
<p>首屆全滬拌角觀摩大會，於昨日上午九時，在橫浜橋精武總會舉行，觀衆五百餘人精武健身房滿坑滿谷，盛况空前，首由主席致開會詞，繼即開始比賽，裁判宋振甫，第一對輕丙級張永發對張才明，才明體格短小，不敵永發勇猛，戰局一面倒，張永發勝來未見費力，輕乙級中代表本市參加全拌角五虎之一之俞鴻標，竟棄權於在章樵。據云鴻標直全運中未能得分後，心灰意懶，此次報名而未出塲者，蓋正緊加練習，暗藏手法，以備十月中句全滬摔角錦標賽中，一顯身手。另盛達鴻對童永福達鴻踢足神速，步子成快，永福連輸於踢足三次，遂成失敗基因。輕甲級全運季軍傳國良，亦棄權於張貴平。另對王文鼎戰局松有演出精彩，文鼎手法老練，假動作尤見神妙，局松有於第一二兩回合中，尙能支持不敗，惟終以王文鼎機智異常，周松有遂以一跤之差敗北。</p>
<h3>網球甲組賽　綠燈勝恩派</h3>
<p>網球聯賽甲組，昨第三次賽，綠燈在本塲以十三比二勝恩派，綠燈除第六對失去二分外，餘均以直落三勝。聯美對友聯之賽，因地濕改期，金蘭對中華，結果明日續誌。乙組第二次賽光明以八比七勝聯美，綠燈亦以一分之差勝梅廳，形勢至為平均，金關以九比六勝畢勛，亦相當緊張，餘均一面倒。結果誌下：</p>
<p>中央勝張園　十三—二</p>
<p>光明勝　聯美八—七</p>
<p>金蘭勝畢勛　九—六</p>
<p>體運勝鐵路　十二—三</p>
<p>綠燈勝梅廳　八—七</p>
<p>上海勝中華　十三—二</p>
<p>又第一次補賽，上海以九比六挫體運，尙有四組均須於日內補畢。又據綠燈會稱：希望中華乙隊，今日下午四時赴該會補賽，</p>
<h3>棒球表演賽第三幕　紅襪今戰美軍聯　昨賽因雨改期明日補賽</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕馬尼拉紅襪隊與明星隊之棒球表演賽第二幕，因昨晨之傾盆大雨，無法舉行。主辦當局已決定改至明（六）日仍照原時在原地舉行。明星隊陣容，已由領隊唐京公佈，首戰有佳妙濱出之中華投手俞長鑾，仍未列為正選，令人不解。明早隊以換湯不換藥之陣容出戰，菲隊殆可不受威脅而橫掃滬上矣。</p>
<p>今日下午三時，紅襪仍依原定秩序在跑馬廳輿軍聯會師。另幕傳統性之獨立節紀念賽，則由業餘棒球會在美軍公學出戰美海軍，三時正開始。</p>
<h3>世運划船預選　加州大學獲勝</h3>
<p>〔聯合社紐吉賽州潑林斯登三日電〕加里福尼亞州八人划船隊，今日在世運會選拔賽中，擊攻哈佛大學隊，與潑林斯登大學隊，獲得代表美國參加倫敦世運會之權利。</p>

<h3>讀者意見　建議兩路局改進接客車業務</h3>
<p>編輯先生：前幾天汽車排長蛇陣加油，雖暫時不見，但汽油是外匯換來的，還是很名貴。主管汽車者亟應如何着用其車，多做些福國利民的事。但天下怪事多，非吾人意料所及。像京滬鐵路的接客汽軍，就是一例。平時常見該種車往來市區中，而車中疎疎落落，客人很少。有時竟除售票員外，無一旅客。前天下午讀者在西藏路正遇該路接客汽車，有好幾個人帶着行李下車，因其時電車公共汽車都擠不上，故搬乘該車到靜安寺路去，同時也有幾個人想上車。但為車上售票員拒絕，不能上車。接客車有客不接，偏要在馬路中軋鬧猛，把一滴血汗一滴汽油，如此浪費，眞乃莫測高深，想來總不致於為顯示闊綽，故意同上海市民開玩笑吧！讀者不敏，研究不出所以然來，祇好懇請貴報代為披霉，希望京滬鐵路給我一個滿意的答覆。專此，敬頌撰安　讀者宋伯通上七月三日</p>

<h3>阿根廷的「貝隆王朝」</h3>
<p>— 雷嬰</p>
<p>一個美國的游客到阿根廷京城一家餐館裏吃飯，一看菜單上單是排骨一類就有二十八種之多，就隨意點了一種「小排骨」。隔了幾分鐘，小」排骨來了，足足二英寸厚，長達十四英寸！上面還厚厚塗上一層白塔油，至少有四盎斯重。</p>
<p>他吃得非常滿意，不想到付賬的時候，更是喜出望外，原來這裏的價格竟比美國便宜了好幾倍！</p>
<p>全世界都在鬧飢荒，但阿根廷却多的是食糧，米麥肉類都能大量出口，成為全世界各地人的最羨慕的地方。阿根廷自己對這一點也很明白，阿根廷的大總統貝隆就在充分利用這一份武器，一步步向着拉丁美洲大獨裁者的路上走去。</p>
<p>誠然，貝隆已經是阿根廷的獨裁者了，但是他所採用的手段却比希特勒之流高明得多。</p>
<p>使他掌握了阿根廷的財富的，是權力特大的「阿根廷貿易局」，簡稱I．A．P．I．。</p>
<p>一個農夫正在愉快地看着自巳豐棯田的地，忽然一個公務員過來拍拍他的手臂：</p>
<p>「恭喜恭喜，今年收成眞好。」</p>
<p>農夫高興地謝謝他的關心。那個公務員却含笑說道：</p>
<p>一政府已經決定把你的收成全部收買，每一個蒲式耳一元三角五分錢。如果你沒有工夫收割，我們來帮你的忙好不好？先生，這完全是帮你的忙呀！</p>
<p>老歲夫一聽見祗能賣這樣低的價錢，不禁就發急起來。可是這有什麽用呢？他們是I．A．P．I．呀！</p>
<p>阿根廷的一般物價的確很低，但要輸出到外國去時，價錢可就高得驚人，所有交易都由貿易局統制。英國目前所需的肉類三分之一是阿根廷運去的，穀類則由阿根廷供給二分之一以上。此外，義大利，法國，希臘，以及其他拉丁美洲國家，都不得不為了要阿根廷帮忙而忍痛聽任剝削。馬歇爾援歐計劃中給各國的貸款，一大半都到了員隆的口袋裏。不但如此，貝隆還要求他的顧客們在政治上作種種讓步。最近，玻琍維亞拒絕了他的要求，結果是裝食糧到玻國去的船隻突然神秘地「擱淺」了幾個月；玻國一讓步，糧船馬上「脫險」。烏拉圭也有過一次反抗，結果照樣也吃了大蛞。</p>
<p>阿根廷的報紙已經全部受政府統制。有一家報館不肯甘心，指摘政窮，結果是貿易局的財務處忽然派人到報館去查賬，說是記賬方法不對，罰他們停刋三天。接着，貿易局的電氣事業處又來了，說報館裏面的電綫裝得不對，報紙必須停刊七天。接着，貿易局的工人福利處又派人來調查了，說排字房的通風設備不對，必須停刋一個月……鬧了半年，報館當局只好改變態度。</p>
<p>貝隆對敎育界也處處釘牢。名敎授胡養向是反政府的，貝隆就突然官布凡今年五十五歲的敎授必須退休，五十五歲的胡賽祗好遵令辭職。但是在下一個星期，代替胡賽的却是一位年巳六十二歲的老敎授，他是「貝隆的人」。</p>
<p>但阿根廷的民衆却並不恨貝隆。他們私下表示：一貝隆本入倒不壞，不過他四週的人們實在太壞了——尤其是「她」。</p>
<p>「她」就是貝隆夫人。她高貴而美麗，滿頭金黃的秀髮，本來是一個不大出名的女伶，忽經貝隆賞識，便做了貝隆的情婦，到一九四五年正式嫁給貝隆。事實上，貝隆夫人倒並不左右貝隆的政策，原來她自已也有一個「小朝廷」，貝隆政府的大員們不但須為貝隆效忠，也經常出入於這個「小朝廷」間，爭以獲得靑眼為榮。她還辦了一張報，天天捧她。</p>
<p>但是，她也有些不安，她知道天下無不散的筵席。然而，她說過：「要是我倒了下去，別人也休想站得起來。你們等着瞧！」</p>
<h3>美麗的貝隆夫人</h3>
<h3>藥</h3>
<p>— 錢文</p>
<p>所謂神農本草三卷，藥三百六十五種。梁陶宏景增一倍，唐修更增一百一十四種，宋再增，至明，此舊本遂有藥一千五百一十八種。李時珍為本草綱目，增三百七十四種，合舊有為一千八百九十二種，是亦可以止矣，淸趙學敏復為拾遺，增八百八十四種。中醫用藥，非若韓信之將兵也，此二千七百七十六味，特備選擇，一方或僅配四五味·藥肆亦無全備者，故病者常有多方求藥之舉。</p>
<p>舊本附方二千九百三十五，增八千一百六十一，合計方一萬一千九十六。附方所以著用，然重訂本張紹棠序云，「因以檢藥可也，謂所載方足治病不可也。」方旣不皆可用，濫增何為？就藥論，此二千七百餘物，果堪治病者幾何？今後想無復有續增者，有則惟待特效新藥之發見。若續增不已，雖神農復生，不能一一鑒定也。</p>
<p>世俗謂醫者意也，用藥則臭腐可化為神奇，競神奇則無物不可作藥。臭蟲人蟲，敝筆廢紙，或誠可用；有捕取山中白雲，放諸密室，呼吸其中者，直遊戲耳，然空氣過嫌乾燥時，此法亦佳。孝子衫燒灰傳面可治面　，取其為葉麻布所製，或亦合理，惟寡婦牀頭塵土和油塗耳瘡有效，何為求塵土必於寡婦之牀？自經死繩燒灰和藥水服，治猝發狂顛，其效在藥，若謂繩灰可用，何必自經死之繩？縛豬繩用臘月者燒灰水服，治小兒驚啼，此則難言其理。鞋底泥和水服治不伏水土，是大危險，萬不能嘗試。至謂天行瘟疫，取初病人衣服於甑上蒸過，則一家不染，此無他，消毒以杜傳染一法耳。紫河車，臍帶巳成廢物，可用也，若謂人骨，天靈蓋，木乃伊，人傀（怪胎）可用，則大成問題。甚至謂人瞻，人勢，人血，人肉可作藥，不知何從得之？</p>
<p>趙學敏謂李時珍本草綱目人部「非云濟世，實以啓奸」，故其害刪去此部。然趙氏書尙列人蚜，人蚜者，死人蛆也，抬屍塲中棺內有之，故以為可用，又註明須向仵作於屍塲取之，以見其合法。但又謂「遂有奸人潛入厝柩處襲棺盜去，」蓋問仵作而不得，則必有貪重利而盜棺者。此物謂可治大痳風，實仍本於「用人療人」之意。痲風不可治，人知之，然人情樂生，患者旣聞此說，必求一試以冀萬一之效。廣州曾出烹啖嬰屍案，犯者雖非殺人自利，滅屍亦法所不容，其人貧箕，得此惡疾，認此為一綫希望，殊可悲憫。邪說之斃至此，趙氏未之思耳，人　入錄，亦足以啓好。人血可治癆療說，民閒仍甚流行，魯迅取作題材，遂成動人之小說。</p>
<h3>作品的鍜鍊</h3>
<p>— 蓮湖</p>
<p>寫作並不是一件容易的事，雖然寫作可以借助於靈感，但靈感之為物，不過是作者在某種環境下偶然而興稍縱即逝的一暼智慧的靈光，並不是隨時隨地可以　致的。即使有了靈感，除了極少數的例外，仍難獲得至高的成果。作者必須鞭辟入裏，投到深淵裏去披泥採珠，下一番千錘百鍊的功夫，纔能獲得「最精妙的意象一，達到盡美盡善的境界。以下便是幾個大文學家艱苦寫作的故事：</p>
<p>福樓拜在通信中常自道著「波華里夫人」的艱辛說：</p>
<p>一我不知道今天何以生氣，許是為了我的小說。這部書總是做不出，我覺得比移山還更困倦，有時我眞想哭一塲。著書須有超人的意志，而我却祗是一個人。」又說：</p>
<p>一我今天弄得頭昏腦暈，灰心喪氣，我做了四個鐘頭，部沒有做出一句來。今天整天就沒有寫成一行，雖然是塗去了一百行。這種工作眞難。藝術！藝術！你究竟是什麼惡魔，要咀嚼我們的心血呢？為着什麽呢？</p>
<p>歐陽修每作一文，即糊在墻壁上，改而又改，到改定時常不存原文一字。朱晦庵嘗見過他的「醉翁亭記」原稿，發端凡三四行，復悉塗去，而易以「環滁皆山也」五字。</p>
<p>王荊公絕句「春風又綠江南岸」，原稿一綠」作一到」，圈去，注曰「不好」，改「過」字，復圈去，改為「入」，旋改「滿」，凡如是十許字，始定為「綠」。（載洪景盧「容齋續筆」）</p>
<p>由此可見天才的完成須有人力。在作品的鍛鍊中，尤易見出。文學家和藝術家所發表的作品都是最後的改定本，在這些成孰熟的作品中，我們往往祗見到收穫，而不見到收獲所經過的艱難困苦的耕耘。如果我們能留心作者寫作的故事，便不難發現「鍛鍊」在作品完成過程中的重要性了。</p>
<h3>雲深處近句</h3>
<p>— 白蕉</p>
<p>為靜安診療所寫蘭應本光上人</p>
<p>下筆隨時見素心，謝庭千載一相尋，還山欲打烏盆破，重為沉吟直至今。</p>
<p>濃處茅多淡處眞，傳　筆下一番新，連山香襲雲深處，幽賞誰來寂寞濱？</p>
<p>也視楊技在凈瓶，相看佛子最惶惶。出山為寫蘭千本，蕭寺人歸夜有星。</p>
<h3>一隻面盆</h3>
<p>— 烟帆</p>
<p>像上星期那樣的漲風，我眞有點擔心我寄出去的稿子到收到稿費後恐怕要買不回一張稿紙和信封。那樣可怕，那樣瘋狂，眞如同地崩海嘯，令人瞻寒！</p>
<p>上星期五，家裏的女傭要買一隻面盆。她拿了四十萬元到百貨店裏去看看，面盆的價格是每只九十五萬元。她要求讓她先付四十萬元，待回家拿了那五十五萬再來取貨，可是店家不肯。於是她急急回來拿了一百萬元去，走到那百貨店時則巳打烊了，其時是下午三時半。次日上午那面盆的價格是一百二十萬元了，女傭的錢又不够，她回來拿了一倍的錢去，終於一百四十五萬買了回來。下午她到別處去看看，同樣大小質地的面盆有的要一百六十，有的一百七十。最後她回來再去看她買過的地方時，則面盆的身價已增至一百八十萬了。這是眞的，一天半內漲一倍，這種可怕的記錄是空前的。一倍二倍三倍四倍，人們普遍地感到一種密雲不雨的低氣壓，緊緊的逼着胸口。</p>
<p>上月份的肥皂聽說漲了四倍，紙烟也漲了二三倍，日用品有那一樣是僅及一倍呢？物價剛剛靜止幾天的時候，兩路車價又以漲價二倍（百分之二百）聞，輪船又要漲了，公用事業又要漲了。地崩海嘯似的漲風，儼然又在醞釀。難道這可怕日子竟沒有過究的時候了慶？</p>
<p>###</p>
<p>北平之新市長已發表而尚未就職，故市參會仍須何市長出當問答之衝。則有議員劉君者，首先發言，希望他「做一完人　，此亦道學之詞，而比上海范君之「做人」二字，又進一層。昔賢常說「三代以下無完人」，可見「完人」之難能可貴，即三代以上亦未必眞有完人也。「完人」比聖賢豪傑還不易，要無遣行，且無遺議，故以孔子之聖而「南子」一面，門人為之不悅，且為近代「打倒孔家店」者之口實；以關公之養，而荊州之事尙以嚴　致敗，貽諜史册，雖豐功偉烈之賢豪，亦難保萬無一失，有一失則不能為「完人」，所以佛家講究苦行歷劫，一塵不染，纔修成丈六金身！劉議員以此期待何市長，可謂特別關懷，然若語止於此，仍是個人關係，修行問題，與參議會之本職，殊不相涉。故劉君繼之質問「北京飯店的兩張鐵床？」此則與市長之「完人」有關係，與　員發言之本旨，亦相符合、</p>
<p>於是何市長亦鄭重說明其一太太由天津回平時，曾借過兩張床，放在宿舍裏，不久即可搬回去。」又曰：「如要貪污，也絕不貪幾把椅子，桌子，或幾張床。」此答詞頗為近理。何太太是歐洲女子，北京飯店是純歐式設備，以其相習相近而借之用之，事亦尋常，與「完人」不生問題。此外有王議員之質問萬生園樹木，有費議員之質問北京飯店產權等，何君亦一一回答，旁聽者固未便率爾批評，且「完人」本不易得，亦未可求全責備。</p>
<p>何君即將去任，故雖到塲，而言談舉止，已離緒滿懷，各議員雖質疑問難，而措詞已比較宛轉，且最後共同決議盛獎市長任內之昕夕憂動，且電請中央另畀新職，以誌去思。則此一會也，何君已獲得甚大之同情的安慰。昔人有言「黯然魂消者，別而已矣。一上塲人到了下塲的時候，羣衆自多原諒，人類是感情的，豈不信哉。</p>

<h3>National Army Completes Encirclement in Eastern Henan; Bandits Begin to Retreat Under Combined Air and Ground Assault; National Army Encircles Tai'an in Central Shandong</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Xuzhou, 4th] The great annihilation battle in eastern Henan reached an unprecedentedly fierce stage on the 4th. The air force's Yellow Sea, East Sea, Bohai Sea, and heavy bomber squadrons, in order to eliminate the main bandit force of Chen and Liu in the Yellow River flooded area, deployed in large formations over the Sui and Qi battlefields all day long. Rain of bullets wove across the sky, and the entire battlefield was suppressed under the iron wings. The National Army's Huang Baitao's troops, centered on Tiefosi and Diqiudian, conducted a radial sweep of the bandits in all directions. Under the suppression of heavy bombers and the fierce attack of the army, the bandit army began to retreat to the rear on the afternoon of the 4th, and the entire war situation took a sharp turn for the worse.</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Xuzhou, 4th] The great battle in eastern Henan is still fiercely ongoing in the east and west areas of Suixian. Yesterday, the National Army's westward advancing corps engaged in a fierce battle with the bandit's 1st and 11th Columns in the Diqiudian area east of Suixian, with a great number of enemy killed. The two strongholds of Tiefosi and Yuxiangpu are still firmly held by the National Army. The eastward advancing corps captured Hanzhai west of Suixian yesterday and completed the encirclement of the bandits.</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Xuzhou, 4th] Du Yuming flew over the Yellow River flooded area battlefield at 11 a.m. on the 3rd to supervise the battle, and then flew to Zhengzhou. According to reports, Du has accepted the invitation of Commander-in-Chief Liu Zhi to serve as Deputy Commander of the Xuzhou Pacification Headquarters. The presidential order arrived in Xuzhou at noon on the 3rd.</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Xi'an, 4th] Military News: Chen Geng's bandit troops, the 4th and 6th Columns, have fled from Wuyang to the vicinity of Xiping, attempting to prevent the National Army on the Pinghan Railway from joining forces.</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Xuzhou, 4th] Fierce fighting continued in Yanzhou yesterday. The bandit's 7th Column launched a full-scale attack on the southwestern suburbs. The struggle for Qianyao, Zhao Village, and Shuangfang was fierce. The National Army, in coordination with the air force, counterattacked the bandits, annihilating many bandits. The battle is still fiercely ongoing in the southwestern suburbs.</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Jinan, 4th] In order to relieve the siege of Yanzhou, crack troops of the National Army from Jinan moved south. The western route recovered Pingyin and, starting on the 2nd, the main force continued to advance eastward, now reaching the outskirts of Feicheng. The eastern route of the National Army moving south along the railway crossed Jieshou, Daxiaoxinzhuang, and Erzhonglipu on the 3rd, and also reached the suburbs of Tai'an in the afternoon. The bandit Tai'an Independent Regiment and the Taining Independent Regiment in the city were greatly panicked.</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Jinan, 4th] The National Army advancing towards Tai'an captured the key point of Majialing near Tai'an in one fell swoop on the morning of the 4th, killing more than a thousand bandits. By 3 p.m. on the 4th, the National Army's outposts had reached the outskirts of Tai'an.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Jinan, 4th] Our southern advancing troops in Jinan frequently report victories, and the recovery of Tai'an is within reach. This reporter accompanied our mechanized troops to the front line for an inspection at 1 p.m. on the 4th. The weather was gloomy today, with drizzling rain. The car passed Wande and met General Wu Huawen at a dilapidated village shop. He said in a firm tone, "I will wrestle with the bandit's 13th Column" to comfort the people. Afterwards, the reporter drove south and arrived at the 4280 Highland of Majialing, ten kilometers northwest of Tai'an, which had just been recovered ten hours ago, at 4 p.m. This place is an important outer stronghold of the bandits in Tai'an. At 6 a.m. on the 4th, our army defeated and occupied the 114th Regiment of the 38th Division of the bandit's 13th Column in one fell swoop, killing more than 500 bandits. The reporter inspected back and forth, and the bandit corpses were lying all over the place, in a very embarrassing state, and the stench was suffocating. Because the bandits stubbornly defended the Xiaochuan stronghold north of the mountain, more than 80 bodies were accumulated. Our army has now completed the encirclement of Tai'an, and the vanguard has crossed Zhouzhuang, eight kilometers west of Tai'an. The reporter returned to Jinan along the railway line at 6 p.m., and refugees returning to their hometowns were constantly on the way, all showing joyful expressions.</p>
<h3>National Army in Eastern Hebei Continues Suppression; Bandits Assemble Between Qixian and Taigu in Central Shanxi</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Beiping, 4th] The North China Pacification Headquarters announced: (1) The bandit's 3rd Column has been forced to flee to the area of Qiangzilu in the northwest mountains of Zunhua, and the National Army is still pursuing closely. It is reported that in recent days, the National Army has been continuously pursuing the bandits who have invaded eastern Hebei in coordination with the air force. In the midst of the hot summer sun, countless bandits have died of hunger, thirst, and exhaustion. (2) The 2nd Regiment of the bandit's Bohai Military Region, numbering 600 to 700, attacked Hui Bridge this morning and engaged in a fierce battle with the defending troops for an hour before finally retreating south. There was also contact in the Wangjiakou area.</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Qinhuangdao, 4th] Battles are still brewing in eastern Hebei. Most of Lin Biao's bandits who went to western Liaoning are wounded, sick, and transporting supplies. Now, a part is moving south from Taitouying. Nie Rongzhen's bandits are in the area north of Guye, posing a great threat to the Kailuan mining area. Fan Hanjie left Qinhuangdao on the 4th and returned to Jinzhou. Currently, transportation between inside and outside the pass relies on the sea route between Tianjin and Qinhuangdao. The repair work on the Beining Railway west of Changli reached Houfengtai on the east side on the 4th and Anshan on the west side.

<h3>Bandits Seize a Large Amount of New Wheat in the Battle of Changli</h3>
<p>Secretary's Wife Was Actually a Spy</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Qinhuangdao, 4th] It is reported that when the bandits captured Changli on the 25th, Tang Yisheng, commander of the traffic police detachment, and the commanders of the 5th and 8th Regiments were captured. Deputy Commander Nie committed suicide after killing his wife because she was injured. The bandits seized 1.5 million catties of new wheat concentrated in the city, 4,000 large bags of flour, and 1 million catties of grain. It was learned after the fact that the wife of a secretary of the traffic police headquarters and two middle school teachers were all working personnel sent by the bandits. In a tense moment, the secretary's wife told the secretary, "Don't be afraid! I'll protect you!" Also, the National Army that recovered Changli was the 8th Army, which treated wounded and sick people and cleaned up the battlefield. Their strict military discipline was extremely moving. When the National Army entered the city, the bandits had already fled far away after destroying fortifications. Many bandit cadres were captured, because the bandits were planning to hold a "Poor Peasants Struggle Conference" of 4,000 people. The plan had just been made when the National Army entered the city. Now, the wheat harvest in Changli and Luan counties has been robbed, and the people's food has become a major problem.</p>

<h3>Adhering to Consistent Position on the Peace Treaty with Japan; China Completes Preliminary Draft; Ye Gongchao Discusses the Negotiation and Convening Process of the Peace Conference with Japan</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 4th] A reporter from the Central News Agency interviewed Vice Minister Ye Gongchao of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs today to inquire about the issue of the peace treaty with Japan. Ye gave the following detailed account of the negotiations between our government and the relevant countries regarding the convening of the peace conference with Japan:</p>
<p>The world situation is becoming increasingly serious, and the differences of opinion among the Allies on various issues are still deepening and expanding. Therefore, a comprehensive peace after the war has not yet been restored. The failure to complete the peace treaties with Germany and Japan has also strained the relations between the Allies.</p>
<p>Over the past two years, our government has made many efforts to sign peace treaties with Germany and Japan. However, due to disagreements among the countries on the organization and procedures of the peace conference, mutual discussions have become deadlocked.</p>
<p>In July of the thirty-sixth year, the United States proposed convening a preparatory meeting for the peace conference with Japan, advocating that eleven countries that fought against Japan should jointly draft the peace treaty with equal qualifications, and the resolution should be established by a two-thirds vote. Although our government was not satisfied with the method proposed by the United States at the time, in order to promote the early opening of the peace conference with Japan and the early conclusion of the peace treaty with Japan, it did not immediately give a positive or negative answer at the time. However, it declared that if any country refused to accept the conference proposed by the United States, China would reconsider its position on this matter and proposed that the final conference of the peace treaty with Japan could be held in China. Later, because the Soviet Union insisted that the preparatory meeting for the peace conference with Japan should only be composed of the four countries of China, the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union, the US proposal was fruitless. In September of the thirty-sixth year, Minister Wang went to New York to attend the United Nations General Assembly. His main purpose was to take this opportunity to discuss the issue of convening a peace conference with Japan with representatives from Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union outside the meeting. Minister Wang repeatedly consulted with the US Secretary of State and the British and Soviet representatives on this matter and strongly urged them to accept a compromise plan proposed by China. However, the general deterioration of relations among the Allies made Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union unwilling to give a definite answer to our proposal. In November of the thirty-sixth year, China, in view of the early restoration of peace and normalcy in the Far East, formally sent notes to the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union, proposing to convene a preparatory meeting for the peace treaty with Japan as soon as possible. It also formally proposed a compromise proposal in order to quickly break the deadlock. This proposal was that the preparatory meeting for the peace treaty should be attended by eleven countries, not limited to the four countries of China, the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union. Motions in the meeting could be decided by a majority vote, but this majority must include the four countries of China, the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union. In other words, these four countries should each retain veto power. Our country's plan respects the interests of the eleven countries that actually participated in the war against Japan on the one hand; on the other hand, it can enable China to obtain special guarantees in the peace conference, so that it will not be forced to accept a draft peace treaty that China opposes. Moreover, since the three countries of Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union also enjoy this kind of guarantee, they have no reason to oppose this plan. Unexpectedly, the Soviet Union's reply still insisted on its four-country meeting proposal. After we repeatedly urged agreement, it still only allowed the other seven countries to participate in the small group committee of the preparatory meeting for the peace treaty with Japan, but did not allow them to attend the preparatory meeting to participate in the vote. Australia strongly opposed the Soviet Union's proposal and believed that it could not agree to our compromise plan. The US government has so far remained silent on the compromise plan proposed by our side. As a result, the issue of the peace conference with Japan has been shelved again. As for the draft peace treaty with Japan, our government has been continuously preparing since Japan surrendered. In August of the thirty-sixth year, a special agency was set up to divide the main clauses of the peace treaty into special topics for in-depth research. At the same time, opinions from all parties were solicited, and relevant government departments also sent representatives to participate in providing opinions. The preliminary draft of the peace treaty has been completed. Currently, the research work is still in progress. From the above facts, it can be seen that our government has fulfilled its due responsibilities for the issue of convening a peace conference with Japan. The reason why the peace conference with Japan has not been convened so far is not because the Chinese government has failed to fulfill its responsibilities. The government will naturally continue to seek the early conclusion of the peace treaty with Japan in the future, in order to meet the expectations of the people of the whole country. At the same time, our government will maintain its consistent position so that China can maintain a special position in the peace conference. Only in this way can we hope to realize a peace treaty that we believe can guarantee China's interests and world peace.</p>
<h3>Xiao Zheng Scheduled to Submit the Draft Farmland Reform Law to the Legislative Yuan for Discussion Today</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Nanjing, 4th] In order to solve China's land problem, the China Land Reform Association, after gathering land reform experts for many days of research, has drafted a "Draft Farmland Reform Law," which will be submitted to the Legislative Yuan by Xiao Zheng, chairman of the association, in his capacity as a legislator. At 4 p.m. on the 4th, Xiao specially invited legislators, land administration experts, and news reporters who were enthusiastic about land reform to publish the content of the draft and to exchange opinions extensively with various legislators, supplementing and revising the original draft. The draft was drafted based on Article 143 of the Constitution, and its purpose is to implement "land to the tillers." According to the provisions of the past "Draft Farmland Reform Law," all farmland in the country shall be owned by farmers who cultivate it themselves from the date of implementation of the law. The area of farmland owned by a self-cultivating farmer's household shall not exceed the scope necessary to maintain the livelihood of a family of eight. However, the farmland recipient shall compensate the original owner for the land price, and the land price shall not exceed seven times the agreed rent amount, and the total amount shall be calculated based on the main agricultural products of the local area and shall be paid off in fourteen years.</p>
<h3>Using Aid-to-China Funds to Order Surplus Military Supplies; US Army Department Agrees to Provide Maximum Assistance</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 3rd] The Aid-to-China plan has a bright future due to the signing of the US-China bilateral agreement. At the same time, secret steps are being accelerated regarding China's use of the $125 million military Aid-to-China fund.</p>
<p>China may obtain more war material. Although military aid is included in the Congressional appropriation bill, it is not implemented by the Economic Cooperation Administration. The United States has also agreed to "no conditions," but this reason has made it difficult for the Chinese government to obtain war material. Officials from both the United States and China cannot predict when the first batch of ordnance and equipment will arrive on the Chinese coast. However, sources say that two positive steps have been taken: First, the State Department has given China the details of accounting and how to prepare consumption reports; second, the US government is prepared for China to begin actual orders. China has previously complained that it could not find officials to help them place orders. Now, the Army Department has designated a group of "order" contacts, led by Lieutenant Colonel Kilkrest, who accompanied the Wedemeyer mission to China and recently returned to the United States. According to the Foreign Aid Act, China was originally free to use it, but China believed that without the advice of the United States, they would not be able to obtain the best deal. Especially important, China notified the State Department that they needed to order surplus military supplies because they were cheaper and delivered quickly, and they were unwilling to order newly manufactured equipment and ordnance. The Army Department has agreed to assist China in ordering surplus military supplies as much as possible, including those stored on Pacific islands. In addition, China also hopes to be able to order US ordnance stocks when the surplus military supplies are exhausted, but the latter has not yet been decided because it will be considered whether it is legal.</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Guangzhou, 4th] After Colonel Baolin of the US Military Advisory Group and others arrived in Guangzhou, they visited Song Ziwen on the 2nd to discuss new military training matters.</p>
<h3>Supervisory Yuan Symposium Discusses Issues Such as Consent Rights</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Nanjing, 4th] The Control Yuan held a plenary committee symposium at 9:50 a.m. on the 4th, attended by more than 100 committee members, with President Yu presiding. After the meeting began, President Lu said: "Regarding the legal bill issue of this Yuan, according to Article 44 of the Constitution, the President will convene relevant Yuan presidents for consultation. I would like to ask you all to provide your opinions. Also, the President's request for consent of the Grand Justices and Examination Committee members has been sent to this Yuan, and there is another meeting resolution to appoint committee members to investigate prices. How to appoint personnel also needs to be discussed." Afterwards, the Secretary-General reported on the Legislative Yuan's dispute record regarding the discussion process of the legal bills submitted by the Control Yuan. Yuan Qinghui, Cao Dexuan, Ni Bi, Liu Pingjiang, and other committee members spoke successively, all believing that the legal bill issue of this Yuan should be resolved through legal channels and has nothing to do with the adjournment of this Yuan. They advocated resuming the meeting immediately. Others believed that before the legal bills of this Yuan have completed the legislative process, even if the meeting is resumed immediately, there is no basis for discussion, and since it has been decided by the meeting of this Yuan, the meeting cannot be resumed rashly. Tian Tongjin and Chen Darong, the two committee members, both believed that the Control Yuan had the right to submit legal bills in the past, and they hoped that it still has this right now, and they hoped that the relevant Yuan presidents could decide this during their consultation. Committee member Hu Wenhui strongly emphasized that the Control Yuan's exercise of supervisory power is not purely for meetings, but can also be carried out separately. Now that the request for consent for the Grand Justices and Examination Committee members has been sent, the consent rights should be exercised immediately according to the consent rights exercise method to complete the government organization, so that the country and the people can be accommodated. Committee member Gu Fengxiang also proposed that the appointment of committee members to participate in the price investigation team is not urgently needed, and the Shanghai Control Envoy's special commissioner can be ordered to investigate, and the method will be decided after deliberation by the general assembly. Finally, the chairman announced: "Your opinions are invaluable and will be brought up when participating in consultations with the relevant Yuan presidents." The meeting adjourned at 12:00 noon.</p>
<h3>Bandit Supply Line Inside and Outside the Pass Destroyed and Cut Off by the Navy; Gui Yongqing Discusses Maritime Operations</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Nanjing, 4th] Military News Agency News: Navy Commander-in-Chief Gui Yongqing personally led the fleet in the Yellow Sea and Bohai Sea at the beginning of last month to intercept bandit ships in order to cut off the transport and supply of bandit troops inside and outside the pass. He has now returned to Nanjing. The reporter visited Gui yesterday, and he gave a very detailed account of the operations in the Yellow Sea and Bohai Sea and the situation of the operations on the Yangtze River. Gui first pointed out that the current maritime transport of bandit troops in the Yellow Sea and Bohai Sea is the main transportation supply line for bandit troops inside and outside the pass. During this cruise in the Shandong sea area and the Bohai Bay for more than 20 days, almost every day bandit ships were intercepted and destroyed by our ships. In the Shandong Peninsula's marine areas, Shidao, Wanzhou Bay, Hutouya, Sanshan Bay, Guajiao, Yuanqikou, and the Liaodong Peninsula's Yingkou, Gaiping, and the Daqing River and Yanghekou areas, more than 100 bandit supply ships were destroyed and captured by our ships. Our ships also shelled the bandit positions in Shidao, Rongcheng Bay, Weihaiwei, and Lejiakou. Commander-in-Chief Gui personally commanded the fleet and went deep into Yingkou Inner Harbor, bombing the West Fort and the bandit power plant in Yingshi. All the bandit fortifications and positions in these ports were destroyed by us. The bandit troops originally defended various ports as bases for transshipment and supply. After this destruction, they have now lost their function, which has a significant impact on the overall war situation. Gui then described the Yangtze River defense operations, constantly pointing to the map hanging on the wall to explain. In total, in March and April of this year, our Yangtze River defense fleet engaged in more than 50 battles of all sizes with bandit troops, killing 673 bandits, capturing 40 bandits, sinking 160 bandit ships, seizing more than 200 dan of bandit grain, and rescuing 20 merchant ships from distress. After May of this year, the battles became more intense. As a result of our navy's fleet's suppression along the river, a total of more than 3,000 bandit troops were killed and 40 bandit ships were sunk in May and June. The bandit troops' dream of crossing the river was completely shattered. Gui also stated at the end that he will soon return to the sea to command operations.</p>
<h3>Youth Party Issues Statement: Decides to Join the Executive Yuan, Two Political Affairs Committee Members to Be Nominated Separately</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The Youth Party held a Central Standing Committee meeting yesterday (the 4th) at 3 PM to discuss the issue of joining the government, which lasted until 9 PM. At 10 PM, Li Huang immediately notified Lei Zhen, declaring that the party had decided to join the government and requesting him to pass on the message. Zuo Shunsheng and Chen Qitian, the two ministers of Agriculture and Forestry, and Industry and Commerce, respectively, will proceed to the capital to assume their posts. It is now heard that the party intends to nominate other individuals for the positions of political affairs committee members, which were originally intended for Zheng Zhenwen and Yang Yongjun, and is currently seeking government approval. The party has also decided to participate in the Legislative Yuan, but the number of seats has not yet been announced.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Wang Shizeng, the spokesperson for the Youth Party, issued the following written statement on the 4th: Our party, from participating in the Constitutional National Assembly to the Implementing Constitutional National Assembly, has consistently adhered to the principle of promoting the implementation of democratic constitutionalism and completing the construction of a modern nation. We have cooperated sincerely with the Kuomintang and the Democratic Socialist Party to share the responsibility of implementing the constitution and building the nation. Previously, due to the long-standing unresolved issue of legislators, our party repeatedly stated that it could not participate in the Executive Yuan until the issue of legislators was resolved, as it believed that democratic politics required seats in parliament before it could be involved in government. For over a month, we have been continuously negotiating with responsible figures of the Kuomintang to resolve the issue of legislators. In the spirit of mutual understanding and compromise, we have gradually achieved a principle agreement, but due to practical difficulties, it will still take a considerable amount of time to fully realize. During this period of back-and-forth negotiation, we have received repeated encouragements from Mr. Zhang Yuejun, Mr. Wu Tiecheng, Mr. Chen Bulei, and Mr. Lei Jingshi, conveying the intentions of the responsible authorities of the Kuomintang, earnestly urging us to carry out the cooperation between the three parties, continue to participate in the government, and jointly overcome the difficulties of the times. Mr. Wu Tiecheng and Mr. Chen Bulei, in their capacities as responsible figures of the Kuomintang, have successively issued statements, reiterating the purpose and desire for cooperation between the three parties, with exceptionally sincere language. Based on our sense of responsibility to the nation and our acceptance of the sincerity of cooperation from friendly parties, our party has decided, following our participation in the Control Yuan and the nomination of Grand Justices of the Judicial Yuan and Examination Committee Members of the Examination Yuan, to propose candidates to participate in the Executive Yuan and continue to participate in the Executive Yuan, to share a portion of the responsibilities of governance, with the hope of making some contributions to national affairs.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Nanjing Dispatch, 4th] Following the publication of the written statements by Chen Bulei and Wu Tiecheng, urging the Democratic Socialist Party and the Youth Party to continue the spirit of unity among the three parties, participate in the Executive Yuan, and jointly promote government affairs, it is heard that the Youth Party has agreed to this. Zuo Shunsheng and Chen Qitian, the Youth Party members in charge of the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry and the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, have scheduled to arrive in the capital from Shanghai on the night train of the 5th to attend the political affairs meeting held on Wednesday. As for the political affairs committee members appointed before the president, it is said that Zheng Zhenwen and Yang Yongjun, members of the party, will resign. Under the extension of the Executive Yuan President Yun Wenhao, the party has proposed Lin Keji and Liu Jingyuan to serve as political affairs committee members. It is also understood that the President is aware of the Youth Party's separate appointment of political affairs committee members, so the appointment order is expected to be issued soon. Furthermore, the Democratic Socialist Party has not yet expressed its position on this matter. Xu Chuanlin stated that he would not participate in the Executive Yuan. As for the legislators, if the Kuomintang can make further concessions by five seats, the Democratic Socialist Party will collectively attend the Legislative Yuan meeting.</p>
<h3>More Than Two Hundred Legislators Form Innovation Club</h3>
<p>Its Spokesperson Discusses the Purpose of Its Establishment</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 4th] The Innovation Club, initiated by more than two hundred legislators, was established last month. Its spokesperson recently stated: The purpose of the Innovation Club is to connect emotionally, exchange opinions, unite progressive elements, and jointly promote political innovation. As our country embarks on constitutionalism, it is essential for the people to learn democratic practices and cultivate democratic habits. Since parliamentary politics is the implementation of a democratic way of life, colleagues in the Legislative Yuan should take the lead in advocating and utilizing it properly to lay the foundation for democratic politics. Now, during the period of suppressing the rebellion, society is turbulent and uneasy, and the people eagerly yearn for governance. The expectations for the Legislative Yuan are particularly keen. On one hand, we must form a stable force, and on the other hand, we must seek progress through innovation and stability through progress. Therefore, after the establishment of the Innovation Club, while paying close attention to the emotional connection of members and the improvement of their living interests, research on political innovation is also actively underway. It has now been divided into seven groups: Internal Affairs, Foreign Affairs, National Defense, Economy, Finance, Education, Culture, and Legal System. Members participate freely, and experts from outside the Legislative Yuan are invited to participate in discussions from time to time to gather ideas and broaden perspectives. The spokesperson also stated that the Innovation Club is not only of political significance but also fully expresses the spirit of democracy and freedom. It is firmly believed that it can promote the innovation of Chinese politics and the realization of democratic constitutionalism.</p>

<h3>Editorial: Review of the Sino-American Bilateral Agreement</h3>
<p>The bilateral agreement regarding American aid has attracted attention both domestically and internationally and was signed in the capital at 3:00 PM on the afternoon of the 3rd. The key points and full text were detailed in yesterday's newspaper. Among them, the necessity of stabilizing our country's economy is emphasized. It agrees to freeze part of the legal tender to reduce currency in circulation and specifies that the Chinese government can effectively use the assets of Chinese citizens in the United States to improve the domestic economic situation. However, there is no provision requiring our country to grant Japan and South Korea most-favored-nation treatment in trade. These points should be what our people are most excited about.</p>
<p>There are varying estimates regarding the amount of Chinese citizens' deposits in the United States, ranging from as high as four to five billion to as low as three to four hundred million, differing by more than tenfold. However, if all of it could flow back into the country, regardless of the amount, its contribution to finance and the economy would be substantial. We will not discuss coercive methods such as requisition or taxation for now. Simply utilizing them through borrowing, remittances, purchasing goods, or transferring them to domestic banks would greatly facilitate the adjustment of foreign exchange funds and the promotion of foreign trade, far exceeding what American aid could achieve. Unfortunately, the United States does not assist in the execution of handling these assets but only allows our country to independently investigate and identify them and take measures within a feasible range to ensure their proper use. We do not know to what extent this will actually be achieved in the future, or whether it will remain a pie in the sky, desirable but unattainable. This is difficult to predict.</p>
<p>Creating a more stable monetary situation is stipulated in Article 2, Item C of the agreement. The method involves freezing a portion of the legal tender obtained from the sale of American aid materials after it is deposited into a special account at the Central Bank. This principle has long been advocated by the financial authorities and supported by general public opinion. Because to seek economic stability, currency and price stability must be sought first, and to demand currency and price stability, one must start from balancing income and expenditure and reducing issuance. Therefore, how to fully and effectively utilize these funds is a major key to the current financial and economic situation. Although the agreement adopts a freezing method to reduce currency in circulation and tighten credit, which is an effective measure for treating the symptoms, if income and expenditure cannot be balanced, increased issuance will still be inevitable. If old banknotes are frozen on one hand while new banknotes are issued as usual on the other, what benefit will this have for stabilizing the economy? It will only allow Chinese and foreign banknote merchants to continue making a fortune from printing money and increase a large expense for the national treasury.</p>
<p>The scope of the so-called legal tender freeze is not the entire proceeds from the sale of materials, but only a part, or even a small part. Because according to the items listed in Article 5 of the agreement, the following must be deducted: (1) All administrative expenses of American institutions in China; (2) Expenditures for developing production and exploiting resources; (3) Expenditures for implementing relevant construction plans or projects; (4) Expenses for continuing relief or work relief projects that have not been completed under the relief agreement; (5) Expenses for promoting rationing in major cities. Moreover, after the total amount of American aid is reduced to 400 million US dollars, the economic aid portion is only 275 million, and according to Section 407 (B) of the Aid to China Act, one percent of rural reconstruction expenses must also be deducted. Calculated in this way, how much legal tender remains that can be frozen, and whether it can still achieve the purpose of contracting currency and stabilizing the economy, is difficult to predict.</p>
<p>During the discussion of this case in the US Congress, many people pointed out the danger of inflation in our country and fervently demanded that it be stopped first. There were many people in our country who sympathized with this claim. As a result, the legal tender from the sale of materials is still so fragmented and cannot be concentrated on the most urgent needs. Undoubtedly, this will make efforts to balance finance and stabilize our economy much more difficult. Some people believe that since the assets of Chinese citizens in the United States are permitted to be fully and effectively utilized, the problem of inflation may be solved from this aspect. We deeply hope that this speculation is not purely ideal.</p>
<p>American aid is divided into two major parts: economic aid and special aid. Except for a small part of the economic aid that will be used for special construction, which may require separate negotiations for repayment in the future, the rest is a gift. We naturally express our deep gratitude for the generosity and enthusiasm of the United States. But at the same time, we should also understand that there will be many major responsibilities and arduous tasks that come with it. We must fulfill them in practice to fulfill the promise of self-help. Foreign Minister Wang has generally pointed out that China must take possible measures to utilize its own resources and national financial resources to develop industry and agriculture, improve the financial and monetary system, reduce trade barriers, and increase foreign commercial relations. These are all long-term tasks that cannot be accomplished overnight. It is hoped that everyone will do their best in their respective positions to jointly shoulder this major mission.</p>
<h3>Tightening of Credit in Xi'an Takes Effect: Speculators Go Bankrupt One After Another, Unable to Manage Market Due to Failure of Capital Turnover</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Xi'an Dispatch, 4th] Since Shanghai implemented strict controls on illegal transactions, speculators here have suddenly lost their standard for price fluctuations. It is heard that they have recently changed to using the Han-Yu market as the standard for transactions. However, due to the authorities' tightening of credit, speculators have failed to manage their capital turnover, resulting in losses of over 100 million. More than 20 businesses have been successively closed. The speculators who were buying and selling short in the market have lost their ability to manipulate. However, if credit eases, a new round of price increases is generally expected.</p>
<h3>Prices Soar in Shenyang and Jinan</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Pan-Yang Dispatch, 4th] The July price surge in Shenyang is like a flood that has broken its banks, and the opening of domestic remittances cannot suppress its momentum. Food leads the way in a sharp rise, doubling in price in three days, comparable to Changchun. On the 4th, sorghum rice was 150,000 per catty, rice was 190,000, military ration flour was 8,500,000 per bag, soybean oil was 300,000 per catty, white sugar was 350,000, meat was 210,000, Elephant brand cigarettes were 1,050,000, Philips cigarettes were 1,900,000, 20-count Celestial Maiden yarn was 240,000,000, and Sunlight white cloth was 9,600,000 (all in circulating currency).</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Shenyang Dispatch, 4th] The Shenyang City Council requested that five train cars of soybeans purchased in the Northeast by the China Trust Bureau but unable to be shipped out be distributed to the people for food. This has been approved by the Political Committee, and 300,000 catties are distributed to the citizens daily.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Jinan Dispatch, 4th] Prices in Jinan continued to soar on the 4th. First-class flour has reached 11 million per bag, 20-count Spider yarn is 795,000,000 per piece, and the black market price of gold is 280,000,000 per tael.</p>

<h3>Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission Formulates Work Plan for Tibet</h3>

<p>[Our Newspaper's Nanjing Dispatch, 4th] The Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission reports: After India's independence, the original British representative office in Lhasa, Tibet, has been changed to the Indian representative office and the Indian flag has been raised.

As for the special privileges enjoyed by Britain in Tibet, which were obtained due to past Sino-British treaties concerning India and Tibet, now that India has become independent, the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission has requested the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to abolish them when concluding a new Sino-Indian treaty. As for Yajiang and Gyantse in Tibet, where a small number of British soldiers were originally stationed, they remain as before. After Britain withdrew from India, our country's policy toward Tibet, in the spirit of Article 120 of the Constitution, guarantees Tibet's autonomy, starting with maintaining the status quo to seek stability, and then seeking its development. The commission's work plan for Tibet in the second half of this year includes: handling the reincarnation of the Panchen Lama, surveying the border between Kang and Tibet, abolishing unequal treaties with Tibet, and promoting commerce between Tibet and the mainland.

<h3>Opening Luan Coal Mine Timber Shortage: Negotiations with the Allied Headquarters for Purchasing Japanese-Produced Timber Yield No Results, Failure to Negotiate Will Affect Production</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 4th] According to Cheng Yifa, Secretary-General of the Kailuan Mining Bureau: If the negotiations between the Luan Mine representatives and the Allied Headquarters regarding the purchase of Japanese-produced timber fail, it will affect the entire industry along the railway line from Zhangjiakou to Jinzhou and Kailuan, as well as 70% of Shanghai's industry. The current negotiations are fraught with difficulties, and the entire issue must be handled by Chief of Staff Mueller at headquarters. It is reported that General Shang Zhen has already written to Mueller about this matter. According to Cheng, Kailuan Coal Mine only has enough timber reserves to last for two months. After the timber supply from Jilin, North Korea, and Sakhalin Island was cut off, Luan Mine has relied entirely on Japanese timber since the end of the war. Last year, Luan Mine obtained a total of three million timbers. Five months ago, Luan Mine, through the Central Trust Bureau, negotiated the purchase of 43 million timbers in exchange for 200,000 tons of coking coal, which Japan urgently needed, but the negotiations failed. Therefore, Cheng and Faulkner, a British senior staff member of Luan Mine, came to Japan and visited Ma Guide, Director of the Bureau of Economic Science, Mr. Clark, Chief of the Foreign Trade Section, and other relevant authorities. However, all parties showed no interest in Kailuan's proposal, stating that Japan also needs to increase timber production in order to achieve its goal of producing 36 million tons of coal this year. Forestry department personnel stated that Japan must preserve its forests as much as possible to prevent floods. Cheng stated that Kailuan Mine currently produces 15,000 tons of coal per day, but if the mine has sufficient materials, increasing it to over 18,000 tons would not be difficult. Kailuan Mine currently has 400,000 tons of coal in storage, which will reach 800,000 tons by the end of the year. When asked by reporters what would happen if the negotiations failed, Cheng stated that either production would be suspended, or timber would be imported from the United States and Canada. If so, the consumption of time and money would also increase.</p>

<h3>Although the China Problem Is Serious: But It Will Eventually Overcome the Difficulties: Chen Lifu Made a Speech in New York</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, New York, 3rd, United Press] Chen Lifu, Vice President of the Chinese Legislative Yuan, said: Frankly speaking, the situation in China is quite difficult. He told the press that the US$400 million in US aid to China would allow China to maintain the status quo, but would not be enough for us to move forward. Chen optimistically said that China has experienced difficulties many times in history and has always been able to overcome them. He believed that although the current problems are serious, they can still be resolved in the same way as in the past. He said: "I have met with Vandenberg and was deeply impressed by the democratic steps taken by the United States. The purpose of my visit to the United States is to study the democratic system and report to President Chiang. Therefore, I am particularly impressed with the process of this Republican National Convention. For example, the modesty of Stassen and Taft to Dewey, so that Dewey won the unanimous nomination of all Republicans, is a great demonstration of democracy in action. President Chiang wrote a letter to introduce me to several congressmen and Mr. Dewey, but I have not yet visited them, because they are busy due to the Congressional recess and the Republican National Convention." Chen is now planning to visit his alma mater, the University of Pittsburgh, whose president has sent a telegram to Chen urging him to return to his alma mater. On this trip, he also wants to visit John L. Lewis, the president of the Mining Union. When he was studying mining in the United States, he joined the Mining Union in Scranton as an intern. Chen accused the Chinese Communist Party of being extremely inhumane when fighting the government army. He said: "The Communist Party always uses the old and weak as vanguards, so that the government army cannot shoot. The Communist Party also trains the old and weak to fight at night, so it is difficult to identify them. Sometimes we open fire and find that the innocent victims are all civilians. Sometimes we do not open fire, but the people who charge are Communist troops. When the Communist Party fights, it does not try to occupy cities, but seeks to destroy cities. Therefore, the government must find ways to provide relief, and more troops are constrained. The psychological effect of these strategies is actually one of the reasons for inflation. After all, modern warfare is not a matter of calculation, it is an economic and political nature." Chen added: "China urgently needs land and banking reform." He admitted that the treatment of Chinese government troops is very poor, so they often harass villagers to obtain food. He compared China to a patient who not only needs blood transfusions and foreign aid, but also needs to clean up the interior and help themselves. He also cited the fact that general banks are unwilling to make long-term land mortgages due to our unstable situation, so long-term planning work cannot be carried out, as an example of how the war hinders stability.</p>

<h3>The Soviet Union Refuses to Guarantee the Cancellation of the Blockade: The Situation in Berlin Deteriorates: Sokolovsky Bitterly Criticizes the Three Powers' Measures Against Germany</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Berlin, 4th] Soviet Commander-in-Chief Sokolovsky invited British Commander-in-Chief Robertson, US Commander-in-Chief Clay, and French Commander-in-Chief Noiret to his headquarters for a meeting last night. He refused to guarantee the cancellation of the blockade of West Berlin and bitterly criticized the measures of the Western countries. His attitude was rare in diplomatic history. According to the German News Agency registered with the Soviet authorities, Sokolovsky made the following remarks to the four commanders at the meeting: "The unilateral separatist measures taken by the British, American, and French authorities have created the difficulties they are currently facing. Didn't those who participated in the London Conference to decide on the division of Germany know the consequences that their decisions would cause and the Berlin issue? Now that the Western powers have decided to divide Germany, why are they only thinking about Berlin now? Berlin is in the Soviet zone and is economically a part of the Soviet zone. The representatives of the three Western countries freely made decisions about Germany without the participation of the Soviet Union, and even without notifying the Soviet Union. This is acting without regard for the interests of the German people. The attempt of the four countries to destroy the German economic system forced the Soviet authorities to take measures to protect the 20 million Germans in the Soviet zone. This is one of the important tasks of the Soviet occupation of Germany." A related source said that Sokolovsky spoke through an interpreter. He entered the room after the three Western commanders entered the meeting room, and only slightly bowed and sat down, without shaking hands with the three commanders present. During the half-hour meeting, he always stared at the documents on the table and did not look at the three commanders present. After bitterly criticizing the various measures of the Western countries, he also said, "My friends, we don't need these anymore." General Clay said afterwards that his stay in the meeting room for 30 minutes was only to observe diplomatic etiquette. French Commander-in-Chief Noiret also frankly admitted that the situation has deteriorated even further than before.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Berlin, 3rd] The half-hour meeting of the four commanders here tonight was fruitless, but made the situation in Berlin even more serious than before. It is generally believed that the solution to the Berlin crisis can only be hoped for if the highest authorities of the four countries jointly discuss effective action. It is reported that the three powers of Britain, the United States, and France have drafted a joint protest to Moscow, intending to submit the entire issue to a higher authority. British observers believe that once the Berlin dispute is officially handed over to the government authorities, due to the reputation involved, it will inevitably make it more difficult for the Soviet government to meet the minimum requirements put forward by the Western powers in order to continue the four-power co-governance in Berlin. British Foreign Secretary Henderson met with officials from various Western allies in Berlin today to hear reports on the recent situation in Berlin. He is scheduled to return to London on the 4th. In addition, the London Committee, composed of US Ambassador to the UK Douglas, French Ambassador to the UK Massigli, and British Foreign Office German Division Director Strang, will remain open on the weekend to await the latest intelligence from Berlin.</p>
<p>[United Press, Berlin, 3rd] US Commander-in-Chief Clay declared after the fruitless meeting that the airlift will continue and increase more than before. We will maintain it for a long time according to the wishes of the American people. In the past, it took a year to airlift supplies to China over the Hump. He believes that France will also participate in the emergency airlift to supply the people of West Berlin.</p>
<h3>Albania Unilaterally Abrogates Economic Agreement: South Criticizes as Violating International Law: Declares that Albania Must Be Responsible for the Consequences of this Move</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Belgrade, 3rd] The Yugoslav official news agency said that the Yugoslav government today sent a note to the Albanian government, replying to the Albanian government's unilateral revocation of the economic agreement and attachments between the two countries. The note explained that under the economic cooperation plan between the two countries, Albania, whose economy was backward and whose war wounds had not yet recovered, had benefited greatly. Albania's claim that the South had failed to faithfully fulfill its treaty obligations was obviously inaccurate and ridiculous.</p>
<p>Moreover, the South-Albanian economic agreement expressly stipulated that in the event of any problems arising from the implementation of the economic cooperation plan, both parties should seek a solution in a friendly and sincere manner. Albania has obviously failed to comply with this provision, and its unilateral breach of contract violates the basic principles of international law. Therefore, the Albanian government must be responsible for the consequences arising therefrom. According to reports, Albania's decision to sever economic relations with the South was notified to the South Korean Embassy in Tirana on July 1 in a note, and on the previous day, June 30, the Albanian government had notified the South Korean government to recall all technical personnel, professors, and other South Korean citizens sent to Albania to "help its revitalization with fraternal feelings." According to reports, the South and Albania signed an economic agreement at the end of 1946, which was equivalent to establishing an economic alliance, stipulating the abolition of tariffs between the two countries, establishing free business relations, and Yugoslavia assisting Albania's industrial recovery.</p>
<h3>Albanian Economy Depends on Others: Daring to Provoke the Tiger</h3>
<p>[United Press, London, 4th, One Telegram] The precise system of military alliances and economic agreements between the Eastern European satellite countries under the backing of the Soviet Union has begun to collapse on the 4th. Albania announced the abolition of the 30-year customs and currency alliance with Yugoslavia, as a strong consequence of Marshal Tito's expulsion from the Communist family. Yugoslavia's resistance to the Kremlin is astonishing, but Albania's provocation of the tiger is even more astonishing. Albania is separated from the Soviet Union by Yugoslavia and its economy depends on the South. Therefore, it was unexpected that it would do this without the Soviet Union's guarantee. Now that the South and Albania have turned against each other, it has overshadowed the rift between Stalin and Tito, because the latter is still awaiting the final decision of the Kremlin.</p>
<h3>South-Albania Breakup Case: May Be Submitted to the Hague Court</h3>
<p>[United Press, Belgrade, 4th] Authoritative sources said on the 4th that Yugoslavia may submit the case of the breakup with Albania to the United Nations or the Hague International Court of Justice. The international law experts of this person said that judging from the last few paragraphs of the protest sent by Yugoslavia to Albania, filing a petition seems to be the second inevitable step. There is no sign that the official has adopted this step or not, but observers believe that if Albania is still determined not to compromise, then South Korea's request for international arbitration may occur.</p>
<h3>Soviet and Dutch Trade Agreement</h3>
<p>[Reuters, The Hague, 4th] The Kingdom of the Netherlands signed a business agreement with the Soviet Union today, stipulating that Soviet raw materials will be exchanged for Dutch machinery and manufactured goods.</p>
<h3>One Quarter of Wages in West Berlin: Issued in New Currency</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Berlin, 4th] The authorities in West Berlin recently issued an order concerning the currency system, announcing that only one-quarter of the wages of workers in West Berlin will be paid in Deutsche Marks. Business people believe that this move by the Western allies is equivalent to recognizing the East German Mark issued by the Soviet Union. The West Berlin authorities' announcement also clarified that the Western authorities never intended to base the West Berlin economy entirely on the Deutsche Mark. Therefore, it was previously stipulated that East German Marks could also be used to pay rent, rationed food, and transportation expenses in West Berlin. The amount of Deutsche Marks issued by the authorities in West Berlin is only sufficient to maintain Berlin's economic relations with West Germany and participate in international trade.</p>
<h3>The Highest Goal of the United States: Establishing Ten Chapters of Peace</h3>
<p>President Truman's Speech</p>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 3rd] President Truman said today at the centennial commemoration ceremony of the laying of the cornerstone of the Washington Monument that the goal of the United States is only to bring peace based on public reason to the world. The United States participated in two world wars to fight for world freedom. The United States has no territorial ambitions and does not demand compensation. He hopes that the great politician Marshall can make the United States an active caregiver for peace.</p>
<h3>Bernadotte's Peace Plan Announced: Advocating the Formation of a Federation Between Arabs and Jews: Suggests that the Security Council Will Be Reported If Rejected</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Success Lake, 4th] Officials here revealed that the permanent peace negotiations in Palestine by UN Mediator Bernadotte stipulated the organization of a federation of Jewish and Arab states, with Jerusalem划into the Arab state. This proposal was submitted to both the Arabs and Jews on June 28. Bernadotte's proposed Jewish-Arab Federation stipulated that it should be built on the original Palestinian mandated territory, including parts of what is now the Kingdom of Outer Jordan. All or part of the Negev Desert area in southern Palestine should be划into the Arab state, and all or part of the Galilee province in the north should be划into the Jewish state. Although Jerusalem is划into the Arab state, Jewish residents should enjoy municipal autonomy. Haifa Port and Lydda should be opened as free seaports and free airports respectively.</p>
<p>In addition, Bernadotte's proposal also advocated the following: (1) The borders between the Jewish and Arab states should be negotiated first with Bernadotte's assistance, and then affirmed and surveyed by the border committee. (2) The Palestinian Federation should promote common economic interests, maintain common undertakings such as tariffs and other treasury taxes, implement construction and development plans, and contact diplomatic defense policies. (3) These powers are exercised by a central committee. (3) The entry and immigration within the national borders of the Jewish and Arab states shall be handled by the Jewish and Arab states, but two years after the establishment of the federation, any one of the Jewish and Arab states may request the federal committee to review the immigration issues within the other country. The minor points in Bernadotte's proposal include protecting the rights of religions and minorities, protecting holy sites and religious facilities, and allowing residents who have been displaced by the conflict to return to their homes. Bernadotte also stated that if the above and other subsequent suggestions can be used as a basis for discussion, he will continue his mediation mission. If rejected, he will promptly report to the Security Council.</p>
<h3>Bernadotte Leaves Cairo, Quickly Returns to Rhodes</h3>
<p>The Arab League Presents Counter-Proposals to Bernadotte</p>
<p>[Reuters, Cairo, 4th] Before departing Cairo for Rhodes today, Bernadotte had a long meeting with Egyptian Prime Minister Nokrashy, during which Nokrashy presented Bernadotte with the Arab nations' official response to Bernadotte's proposals, which included counter-proposals. Bernadotte stated afterward that he expects to receive the Jewish side's response to his proposals tomorrow and will spend several days studying them. Bernadotte secretly conferred with the Arab League's key committee last night. Afterward, Lebanese Prime Minister Solh, who attended the meeting, stated that the Arab side had informed Bernadotte that it could not accept his proposals as a basis for negotiation, as the Arab side remains steadfast in its demand to establish an Arab state in Palestine. Furthermore, Arab sources in Cairo anticipate that the Jewish side will also reject Bernadotte's proposals, as the inclusion of the Negev region in an Arab state would force the Jewish side to halt immigration and cut off the Jewish state's connection to the Dead Sea potash industry, which is one of its primary sources of income. Additionally, the Jewish state advocates for Jerusalem to be placed under United Nations trusteeship and opposes placing it under Arab jurisdiction.</p>
<h3>Rumor: Ho Chi Minh Travels to Soviet Capital</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Saigon, 4th] According to sources on the communist side, Ho Chi Minh recently traveled to Moscow. This news has been confirmed by a recent commentary in the Soviet newspaper "Izvestia" regarding the Vietnam Agreement.</p>
<h3>Republican Party Likely to Win Next U.S. Presidential Election</h3>
<p>Opinions of Top American Journalists</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 3rd] According to Newsweek, leading American political writers unanimously predict that the Republican Party will win the presidential election this year. Newsweek surveyed fifty top political journalists in Washington, asking which party, Democratic or Republican, was likely to win the next presidential election and what the most important factors influencing the election were. They unanimously predicted a Republican victory, citing the Democratic Party's long tenure in power, a lack of faith in Truman and his administration, internal divisions within the Democratic Party, and Wallace's organization of a third party.</p>
<h3>U.S. to Discuss Military Alliance with Five Western European Nations; Alliance Possible with Greece and Turkey</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 3rd] Authoritative sources indicated on the 3rd that the United States may immediately consult with the five nations of the Brussels Treaty to establish a military defense alliance against aggression. These five nations include the United Kingdom, France, Belgium, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg.</p>
<p>[United Press, Athens, 3rd] Military and diplomatic sources here predict that Turkish Chief of Staff Omurtag may conclude a military alliance with Greece during his current visit, as he is currently holding secret talks with senior political and military leaders of the government. The United States believes that Turkey's previous concerns about increased Soviet pressure following the Berlin crisis have now been eliminated or resolved, and it has therefore decided to seek active support as a response.</p>
<h3>America Celebrates Independence Day: Nation Engages in Day-Long Revelry and Unrestrained Fun</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, New York, 4th] The American people today celebrate the 172nd anniversary of Independence Day. It is reminiscent of this day in 1776 when the founding fathers, guided by Jefferson's principle of the rights to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness, declared American independence. Since then, patriotic speeches and fireworks displays across America have become customary. Hundreds of thousands of Americans are taking advantage of this holiday to visit beaches and other recreational areas. Approximately three million New Yorkers are leaving the city for leisure, while tens of thousands are entering the city for sightseeing. Today's travel will fill highways with an estimated thirty million cars. This year's Fourth of July arrives during a heated national election season, but Americans today will set aside politics and enjoy a day of unrestrained joy.</p>
<p>Over a Hundred Dead</p>
<p>[United Press, Chicago, 3rd] Due to Independence Day revelry, the number of accidental deaths in the United States had already exceeded one hundred by the evening of the 3rd, and this is only the beginning. Millions of Americans are leaving cities for the countryside and beaches for the weekend, creating unprecedented travel congestion. The death toll is rising sharply with the holiday; at least 122 people have already died. Vehicle accidents caused 65 deaths, drownings 20, explosions 1, plane crashes 2, and other causes 34. Among the states, New York and Pennsylvania each recorded the highest number of deaths at nine.</p>
<h3>The Turbulent Latin America</h3>
<p>—America's Underside—</p>
<p>Colombia: Population of 10 million, struggling due to inflation.</p>
<p>Economically, its main industries are oil and precious metal production. Factories producing consumer goods have increased. Coffee exports are second only to Brazil.</p>
<p>The government led by President Ospina Pérez is a democratic institution. There are approximately 10,000 communists. A major bloody rebellion occurred this April. Currently, unless communist leader Ospina can control the opposition parties to prevent a revolution, small-scale riots are possible.</p>
<p>Six Central American Nations: Guatemala, Honduras, Panama, Costa Rica, Nicaragua, and El Salvador, with a combined population of 9 million. The region's exports include fruit, coffee, cocoa, cotton, sugar, gold, livestock, and fibers. The state of inflation is milder than in South America. Except for Panama and Costa Rica, revolutions and dictatorships occur constantly. Except for Costa Rica, communist forces are weak.</p>
<p>Sent by Weng Shaoqiu from New York</p>
<p>The current political trends in each country are as follows:</p>
<p>Revolution feared in Guatemala.</p>
<p>The government structure in El Salvador is unsound.</p>
<p>Costa Rica is teetering on the brink after the first revolution in twenty years.</p>
<p>Panama recently experienced turmoil due to elections.</p>
<p>Cuba: Population of 5 million. Its economic lifeline is sugar production, with Cuba's sugar output ranking first in the world.</p>
<p>The Cuban government is a democratic institution. There are approximately 150,000 communists, but the communist policy is more focused on expanding its power through political means, with fewer riots.</p>
<p>The last revolution occurred in 1933. There is no current revolutionary trend, but the government fears that a riot will erupt.</p>
<p>Mexico: Previously prone to revolutions, but since a small-scale rebellion in 1938, there has been no political turmoil.</p>
<p>Mexico has a population of 23 million. Industry is gradually increasing, expanding from iron and oil production to pharmaceutical production.</p>
<p>The government led by President Alemán is a democratic government. The Communist Party claims 20,000 members, but it lacks power and there is no imminent serious unrest.</p>
<p>Dominican Republic: Under the rule of Generalissimo Trujillo since 1930.</p>
<p>The national population is 2 million, and the standard of living has gradually improved.</p>
<p>Politically, the government practices a dictatorship. The scale of industry is small. In 1947, rebels attempted to invade from Cuba, but failed.</p>
<p>Generalissimo Trujillo has a secret police force, and as long as the secret police remain loyal to him, there will be no coup.</p>
<p>Haiti: Neighboring the Dominican Republic, with a population of 3 million. Most of the people still live as primitive farmers.</p>
<p>The Haitian government is a democratic organization. Communist forces are weak. A revolution occurred in 1945. There will be no revolution at present.</p>
<p>Venezuela: The main industry is oil, and oil accounts for the majority of exports. The exported unrefined oil ranks first in the world.</p>
<p>Venezuela has a population of 4 million. The government led by President Gallegos is a democratic organization. There are approximately 20,000 communist party members, but they cannot cooperate closely. A revolution occurred in 1946, which failed. The former president attempted to regain power, but there is no current revolutionary trend.</p>
<p>Uruguay: The most democratic country in Latin America, with a population of 2.2 million. The people live better than in other Latin American countries.</p>
<p>The main industries are meat production, flaxseed, and other agricultural products.</p>
<p>A revolution occurred in 1935. The current political situation is stable.</p>
<p>Argentina: Population of 16 million. Generally, the people live better, and industry is more advanced than in other South American countries. Most of the products are consumer goods, but heavy industry has begun to operate.</p>
<p>The Argentine Communist Party claims to have 30,000 members, but its power is not great. A revolution occurred in 1943. The current political situation is stable.</p>
<p>In summary, it can be seen that most Latin American countries have the possibility of maintaining peace, but some countries may experience disasters within a few months, although large-scale revolutions are unlikely. The politics of Latin American countries are generally led by powerful figures, leading governments to stability. However, progress is slow, and the people hope to improve their lives, and some people have taken action to realize their ideals. (To be continued)</p>
<h3>Prominent Democrats Support Eisenhower for President; Roosevelt Jr. and Others Oppose Truman's Nomination</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, New York, 3rd] Well-informed sources claim that the movement to support Eisenhower as the Democratic presidential candidate is growing, and many prominent Democrats agree with yesterday's resolution of the Georgia Democratic Convention to invite Eisenhower to participate in the presidential election. Pivon, a member of the National Democratic Committee of Delaware, stated that the 67 Michigan delegates attending the Philadelphia convention may unanimously nominate Eisenhower. New York Mayor O'Dwyer, Roosevelt Jr. in California, and Averell in Chicago all advocate preventing Truman from participating in the election at the Democratic convention. Roosevelt Jr. telegraphed 1,234 Democratic delegates, stating, "In the current world crisis, the Democratic Party urgently needs to nominate a strong and qualified figure as leader."</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 3rd] The movement to nominate Eisenhower as the Democratic presidential candidate, bypassing Truman, has increasingly attracted the attention of the American political world today. The 28 delegates from Georgia to the Democratic National Convention have been instructed to vote in favor of Eisenhower, greatly boosting the momentum of the movement to draft Eisenhower. This was decided at the Georgia Democratic Convention, where the atmosphere was extremely enthusiastic. The Georgia delegation is the first to be instructed to vote in favor of Eisenhower at the Democratic National Convention to be held in Philadelphia in mid-July. The Virginia Democratic Party also instructed its National Convention delegates today to support Eisenhower's nomination and oppose anyone who supports Truman's civil rights plan. However, supporters of Truman are eager for Eisenhower to issue a statement to end this nomination movement once and for all.</p>

<h3>Wind, Rain, and Hail Destroyed Many Houses; Over a Hundred Casualties at Jingjiang Public Hall; Shanghai Bureau and Subei Native Association to Meet Today to Discuss Aftermath</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] Around 2:00 AM yesterday, the weather suddenly changed, with fierce winds and torrential rain descending like an avalanche. Added to this were thunder and lightning. Hail, unseen for over a decade, fell amidst the heavy rain. The entire city of Shanghai was engulfed in this terrifying atmosphere for as long as forty minutes. During this time, due to the excessive force of the wind and rain, many utility poles, fences, billboards, and simple structures were attacked and collapsed. The most tragic incident occurred at the Jingjiang Coffin Storage Hall at No. 2, Lane 306, Dapu Road, where eighty flat houses collapsed, trapping over four hundred refugees under the rubble. As of yesterday afternoon, twenty-seven deaths and eighty-nine injuries had been confirmed.</p>
<p>Before the war, the Jingjiang Public Hall was originally a place for the Jingjiang Native Association to store coffins. Since last October, large numbers of refugees from northern Jiangsu have successively occupied the premises, stacking the stored coffins in one room, with some even abandoned outside. The residents were organized into seventy-four households, some living in the eastern houses, and the rest living in eighty newly built tile houses on the western side, totaling over four hundred people. The area was crowded, noisy, and filthy. Last night, due to the hot weather, everyone was cooling off outside. They only returned to their houses to sleep late at night. Unexpectedly, around 2:00 AM, as they were sound asleep, fierce winds suddenly rose, followed by a barrage of hail, and then torrential rain like a rushing torrent. The houses there, due to their simple construction, could not withstand the attack, and with a loud crash at 2:58 AM, they all collapsed, catching the refugees completely off guard, and everyone was trapped under the rubble. Chaos erupted instantly, with cries shaking the heavens. Upon receiving the report, the police and fire departments immediately notified ambulances from various districts to rush to the rescue. Police Chief Yu Shuping and Fire Chief Zhou Zhaoxiang also led Song Tingjun, head of the Lujiawan Police Substation, Section Chief Zhong He, Wang Lixian, Section Member Dong Yixiang, Police Captain Feng Bojun, Police Officers Zhang Hanqing, Zhao Hengqing, Liu Xianglin, and more than ten others, personally braving the rain to rush to the scene to direct the rescue. After more than ten hours of excavation by the police officers, twenty-four bodies were unearthed at the scene. Three people died after being sent to the hospital. Other injured people were sent to Guangci, Zhongshan, Red Cross, Nanyang, and Municipal Eighth Hospital for treatment. Eighty-nine people were recorded, but those who were temporarily bandaged and discharged were not included. Guangci Hospital received the most injured, and Dr. Fu Peibin even voluntarily drew 300 cc of blood to treat a seriously injured refugee, a spirit particularly commendable.</p>
<p>The reporter arrived at the scene at 3:00 PM. Ambulances were still there loading the injured. Only a pile of rubble remained where the houses had collapsed. The lucky survivors sat on top of it, some sighing deeply, some wailing in sorrow over the loss of their parents, children, and siblings, which was heartbreaking to hear.</p>
<p>List of Deaths</p>
<p>The names of the deceased are listed below: Those who died at the scene of the collapse: Gu Kanghe, 60 years old. Wu Youdi, 3 years old. Huang Zhangshi, 40 years old. Feng Didi, 3 years old. Wei Shiwu, 54 years old. Chen Lushi, 45 years old. Chen Rushan, 8 years old. Chen Rukai, 11 years old. Wei Wangshi, 54 years old. Zuo Ruiqing, 38 years old. Zuo Xuesheng, 8 years old.

<p>Director of Social Affairs Inquired and Offered Condolences</p>
<p>Wu Kaixian, Director of Social Affairs, rushed to offer condolences yesterday morning after hearing the news and presented 10 million yuan in condolences. In the afternoon, Yuan, the director of the Fourth Bureau, and Sun, the section chief, also went to assist in handling the aftermath and transported some of the injured to the Caohejing Municipal Sixth Hospital for treatment. Regarding future relief measures, the bureau will discuss them today. Gu Zhuxuan and Jin Jiulin, public-spirited gentry from northern Jiangsu in Shanghai, have also scheduled a meeting of the native association today to discuss the aftermath, it is said.</p>

<h3>Adjustment of Public Utility Prices: Bureau of Public Utilities Explains Two Points</h3>
<p>The Bureau of Public Utilities is explaining two points for citizens to understand the nature of public utility prices and the difficulties in maintaining the supply of various public utilities, as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Public utility prices are far behind other prices;</p>
<p>The adjustment of public utility prices is calculated based on the index released last month and known prices, so it always lags behind prices. Each time a price is calculated, it is always attempted to be lowered. By lowering prices month after month, it has now fallen far behind general prices. Consider the wholesale price index for the week of June 20-26 compiled by the China General Chamber of Commerce:</p>
<p>Food category: 1,380,174 times</p>
<p>Textiles category: 1,978,946 times</p>
<p>Fuel category: 1,513,975 times</p>
<p>Metals category: 1,964,835 times</p>
<p>Building materials category: 1,845,987 times</p>
<p>Chemicals category: 2,698,621 times</p>
<p>Miscellaneous category: 1,706,206 times</p>
<p>Total index: 1,708,481 times. In the most recent week, each rose by several percent, and the total index should be around 2 million times. The following are the multiples of the new water, electricity, and gas prices for July compared to before the war, as announced yesterday:</p>
<p>Tap Water</p>
<p>Retail: 300,000 times, Ordinary: 825,000 times</p>
<p>Electricity Below 10 degrees: 347,000 times</p>
<p>11 degrees to 30 degrees: 463,000 times</p>
<p>Above 31 degrees: 578,000 times</p>
<p>Users who actually use 20 degrees of electricity only pay 405,000 times, and users who use 30 degrees of electricity only pay 424,000 times.</p>
<p>Gas: 1,000,000 times</p>
<p>Compared to 2 million times for the price of rice, approximately 3 million times for the price of coal, and approximately 2.3 million times for the price of cloth, the smallest is only one-seventh, and the largest is less than one-half.</p>
<p>(2) Public utilities are only allowed to adjust prices once a month, seeking only to barely maintain supply so as not to affect other prices:</p>
<p>The government is very aware of the low purchasing power of ordinary people, so it always tries to reduce the public utility burden on ordinary people as much as possible. The free supply of tap water this time, or the low-priced retail water, and the tiered electricity system are all characteristics of this month's pricing. Each 10 degrees of electricity can power a 25-watt light bulb for 400 hours. Assuming that an ordinary small family uses three 25-watt light bulbs and lights them for 4 hours every day, it only needs 9 degrees a month. That's why we set 10 degrees as the minimum standard. The public utility price standards set last month (June) were based on the assumption that prices would remain stable last month, allowing companies to balance their income and expenses. However, unexpectedly, general prices rose sharply, causing companies to tighten their belts again and again, almost exhausting their resources, and they were still unable to pay the salary increases after the release of the cost-of-living index at the end of the month. They had to be assisted by the government with loans to cope. The prices set this month are based on the same standards as last month, so that they can barely maintain supply and avoid shutdowns. However, since the prices are far below other prices, they cannot be used as an excuse to raise prices. We hope that citizens will understand.</p>

<h3>Zhapu Seaside Bathing Beach Still Retains Primitive Charm: A Weekend Resort for Morning Departure and Evening Return</h3>
<p>The Evening Drum and Morning Bell Echo from Xiaoputuo Island; The Paved Roads Offer Magnificent Views</p>
<p>[Special Report from Our Newspaper] The Zhapu Seaside Bathing Beach, located ninety kilometers south of Shanghai, has become the only summer resort for Shanghai ladies and gentlemen during weekends. The transportation is convenient, and one can depart in the morning and return in the evening by car.</p>
<p>The seaside bathing area is actually located at the foot of Huangshan Mountain in Huanggu Town, a must-pass on the way to Zhapu. The sandy beach is fine and naturally divided into three parts: west, middle, and east. Its area is larger than that of Repulse Bay in Hong Kong. The only difference is that Repulse Bay has been artificially polished and has modern facilities, while Huangshan Bathing Beach still retains its primitive charm. However, the nearby calm waters and the distant small islands with sailing boats offer the same charm. The beautiful scenery can be called a wonder of Jiangnan. Just as Suzhou, Hangzhou, and Wuxi are suitable for spring and autumn travel, Huangshan Bathing Beach will be the first choice for summer recreation.</p>
<p>Currently, most of those who come to Huangshan Seaside for summer vacation are Russian expatriates. The locals have temporarily built hundreds of thatched huts at the foot of the mountain, renting them out to people who take long-term summer vacations. The price per room ranges from sixty to seventy million to one hundred million yuan. However, the buildings are simple and can only shelter from the wind and rain, but they are interesting enough to broaden the minds of tourists.</p>
<p>The bathing area faces the sacred island of Xiaoputuo, which houses the magnificent Guanyin Temple, hidden in the green trees. Every time the evening drum and morning bell echo with the sound of the blue sea, the mood is clear and the interest is endless.</p>
<p>Yesterday was a weekend holiday, and many people from Shanghai went there for sightseeing. The Russian Expatriate Association prepared four or five large trucks for all-day excursions. Most of the sheds in the bathing area were occupied by Russian expatriates. Being among them is like being in a "Little Russian Village."</p>
<p>Yesterday, our reporter traveled along the Shanghai-Minhang-Nanzhe Highway. After traveling 21 kilometers to Minhang, the river ferry has been changed to a flat-decked large iron barge since last year, which can load five or six large trucks or more than ten small cars. A diesel engine is installed on it, making the crossing very convenient. The ferry fee has been adjusted due to the recent soaring prices. It costs 940,000 yuan per trip for trucks and large trucks, 700,000 yuan for small passenger cars with seven seats or less, and 240,000 yuan for motorcycles. After crossing the river, travel another 21 kilometers to Tuolin, 7 kilometers to Caojing, 14 kilometers to Jinshanwei, and 6 kilometers to the Jin Sinang Bridge at the border of Jiangsu and Zhejiang. After entering Zhejiang, travel 19 kilometers to Huangshan Seaside and 2 kilometers to Zhapu Town. The entire journey takes about three and a half hours by car. The road is very flat, especially the section in Jiangsu Province, which is wider. Two-thirds of the roadbed between Shanghai and Zhapu runs on the seawall, with fields connected on one side and the sound of waves and the shadows of boats on the other, offering beautiful scenery. There are regular long-distance buses from Minhang to Zhapu, running once a day. The buses from Zhapu to Hangzhou depart once a day at 8:30 every morning in both directions. There is another shortcut to Huangshan Bathing Beach from Shanghai: take a train to Jiading, then transfer to a bus via Pinghu to Zhapu.</p>
<p>If Huangshan Bathing Beach can be equipped with modern facilities, it will undoubtedly be the only excellent seawater bathing beach in Jiangnan, comparable to Hong Kong Island in Lingnan and Qingdao in North China.</p>
<h3>The General Labor Union Convenes a Symposium to Review the Direction of the Labor Movement: Labor-Management Cooperation Can Overcome Difficulties</h3>

<h3>Aircraft Fuel is in Short Supply, Vehicle Fueling Volume is Reduced, Gasoline Panic Should Not Reoccur</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The gasoline panic in this city last month has become a serious social problem. Now that July has begun, citizens are very concerned about whether the supply and demand of gasoline can be balanced. When interviewed by a reporter yesterday, a person in charge of a gasoline company believed that a panic should not occur this month. The gasoline import quota for this month is still 1.5 million gallons, the same as last month. However, in terms of distribution, the authorities will reduce unnecessary consumption. For example, the allowable refueling volume for small cars has been reduced by 20%, and the allowable refueling volume for large trucks has been reduced by 30%. Therefore, although the supply volume for this month is the same as last month, the demand volume has relatively decreased. Rationally speaking, the situation of last month should not occur again. As for aviation gasoline, although the current selling price is as high as 1,587,000 yuan per gallon, recently, companies such as China National Aviation Corporation have reduced the number of domestic flights, and the demand has decreased. A monthly supply of 3.78 million gallons is sufficient to meet the needs of the three institutions: the Central Government of China, the Civil Aviation Administration, and the Air Force. Although a portion of this amount was withdrawn last month, the current inventory can at least last for two weeks. At the same time, the Import and Export Committee has approved an additional import of aviation gasoline, so the Civil Aviation Administration can definitely maintain its operations without worry.</p>

<h3>Suspicious Case of Ren Gui'e's Sudden Death; Her Brother Sends a Letter Certifying That It Was Not Suicide; Claims That There Was No Ghostly Haunting or Mental Disorder</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] In the case of the tragic death of Yu Hang woman Ren Gui'e after her marriage, the District Prosecutor's Office has filed a public prosecution against Ren's husband, Ruan Bingfa, and others on suspicion of aiding and abetting suicide. Now, according to a letter from Ren's brother, Benyuan, from Yu Hang: "My sister, Ren Gui'e, married Ruan Bingfa in Hangzhou on April 11. On the 14th, I accompanied her to Shanghai. I stayed at Ruan's house for six days and only returned home on the 19th. On the night of the 21st, she swallowed a gold ring. Calculating the days, my sister was alone in Shanghai for only two days after her marriage. The so-called ghostly haunting and mental disorder, I accompanied her for six days, and there was no such thing. Swallowing a gold ring, according to a letter from Ruan Bingfa, was forced by a woman to swallow (the original letter was submitted to the District Prosecutor's Office), so it was not suicide. Moreover, suicide must have a reason. My sister's engagement and marriage were both voluntary. She had been newly married for half a month and had no stimulation. Since the swallowing of gold was forced, fortunately, she did not die. Why would she cut her throat with scissors again? In addition, there was a cloth strap around her neck, and her clothes were neat. Moreover, Ruan and others confessed to the police station that my sister requested to call the police after swallowing gold but was prevented from doing so, and other suspicious points, there are many other reasons why it was not suicide, which are all detailed in the complaint," and so on.</p>
<h3>July Coal Price Approved and Announced Yesterday; Average Increase of 160%</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The new coal price for July, which has been brewing for many days, was finally officially announced by the government yesterday. The new price is an average increase of 160% compared to the coal price in June. According to Mr. Zhang Xiwei, chairman of the Fuel Management Committee, in an interview with a reporter from this newspaper, the price increase was unavoidable. He had been running around and negotiating for many days for this matter before making the final decision to increase the price. He only returned to Shanghai from Nanjing today (the 4th). The new price is still half the price of coal on the black market. It has been learned that the new price of various grades of coal in July is as follows: (The following prices are per ton, in thousands of yuan)</p>
<p>(A) Public utilities, delivery at the dock: 31,784 yuan. Delivery by the entire ship: 31,184 yuan.</p>
<p>(B) Railways, military transport, navy, dredging wharf delivery: 32,984 yuan.</p>
<p>(C) Power plants, ships, and traffic structures under the jurisdiction of the Municipal Public Works Bureau in other ports: 32,784 yuan. No. 2 slack: 32,984 yuan. Mixed: 33,184 yuan. No. 1 slack: 33,384 yuan. No. 2 lump: 33,684 yuan. Mixed lump: 33,984 yuan. Train lump: 34,284 yuan. No. 21 screened lump: 34,584 yuan. Mixed screened lump: 34,884 yuan.</p>
<p>(D) Factories and military and government agencies: Jilong slack: 36,384 yuan. No. 2 slack: 36,584 yuan. Mixed slack: 36,784 yuan. No. 1 slack: 36,984 yuan. No. 2 lump: 37,284 yuan. Mixed lump: 37,584 yuan. Train lump: 37,884 yuan. No. 2 screened lump: 38,184 yuan. Mixed screened lump: 38,484 yuan.</p>
<p>(E) Foreign coal: Public utility coal slack: 38,688 yuan. Coal block: 42,380 yuan. Factory coal slack: 43,498 yuan. Coal block: 48,100 yuan.</p>
<p>(F) White coal: Great Wall slack: 16,692 yuan. Great Wall block: 23,218 yuan. Other coal slack: 26,0116 yuan. Other small pieces: 30,602 yuan. Other screened block: 46,150 yuan. The prices of coal in groups C, D, E, and F are all for delivery at the Pudong wharf. Delivery at the Mai Gen Road warehouse is subject to an additional 2.4 million yuan per ton.</p>
<p>Chairman of the Fuel Management Committee Explains the Reasons for the Unavoidable Adjustment</p>
<p>Mr. Zhang Xiwei also issued a written explanation of the new prices for the amount of coal in July, as follows: "The coal price has been maintained for one month since June 1 and has not been adjusted. However, since mid-June, various commodity prices and the cost of living index have all risen sharply. If the coal price is not adjusted again, not only will the mines be unable to produce, but also the work of transportation and shipping will be suspended. For example, the delivery price of coal in Qinhuangdao in June was 6,778,000 yuan per ton. After deducting the railway freight from the mining area to the port of 1,220,000 yuan (using coal to pay for transportation), calculated at the current exchange rate, it is only equivalent to more than 2 US dollars per ton. Calculated at the black market US dollar, it is only worth more than 1 US dollar. Even calculated at the flour price at the end of June, one ton of coal can only be exchanged for more than one bag of flour. It is difficult to continue production without adjustment. Furthermore, in terms of the allocation price of our association in June, the allocation price for public utilities was 12,255,000 yuan. In addition to the mine price of 6,778,000 yuan, the remaining expenses such as shipping fees, insurance fees, and loading and unloading labor must also be adjusted in order to be handled. After the mine price is adjusted, the North China Self-Defense Special Donation and stamp duty will also increase accordingly. The general freight rate from Qinhuangdao to Shanghai has risen to more than 7.3 million yuan per ton, so the fuel transportation cost cannot but be increased to 5 million yuan per ton. The dock workers, due to the sharp increase in prices, have demanded a salary increase and have repeatedly threatened to strike, all of which have been prevented through various means. However, since the cost of living index for workers has increased, wages cannot but be increased. Therefore, the fuel allocation price cannot but be raised. However, if the price after adjustment is compared to the price of one ton of fuel oil to two tons of coal, the coal price is still much lower than the oil price. If compared to foreign coal, it is even lower. Because the import of foreign coal, plus tariffs, requires a price of more than 30 US dollars, or more than 70 million legal tender per ton. Therefore, it is hoped that all departments under control can increase production, the Beijing-Hankou Railway can be repaired as soon as possible, and Kai Luan coal can be shipped south in a continuous stream to supply the needs of the Beijing-Shanghai area."</p>
<p>More Than 8,000 Tons of Taiwanese Coal Shipped to Shanghai</p>
<p>Amid increasing shipments of Taiwanese coal to Shanghai, another 8,500 tons arrived in Shanghai yesterday to supply the market. The Fuel Management Committee has dispatched personnel to receive and unload the goods. It is said that more than 100,000 tons can still be shipped in this month.</p>
<p>Assisting Coal Mines to Increase Production, Loans of 800 Billion Yuan to be Approved</p>
<p>Dongshe News: In order to assist coal mines in the three regions of Central China, South China, and Taiwan to increase production, the government has decided to allocate huge amounts of money this year to increase production. The Four Joint Offices has approved loans totaling 817 billion yuan to the five coal mines of Central China, East China, Huainan, Zhongxing, Jiangnan, and Hunan, including 600 billion yuan for construction loans, 105 billion yuan for coal purchase loans, and 112 billion yuan for working capital loans. Among them, East China Coal Mine accounts for 70 billion yuan, Huainan Coal Mine accounts for 600 billion yuan, Zhongxing Coal Mine accounts for 100 billion yuan, Jiangnan Coal Mine accounts for 115 billion yuan, and Hunan Coal Mine accounts for 22 billion yuan, which will be lent by China Communications Bank.</p>

<h3>Refugees Steal Wood; Organize a Crowd to Stab Workers</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The wooden stakes along the Suzhou River near the Doyang Bridge Jijiawan No. 1 of the Oil Plant of the Industrial Chemical Laboratory of the Ministry of Economic Affairs in Zhabei are often stolen by thieves. At about 8:00 pm last night, some refugees on a boat came to steal again. After being discovered by the factory workers, the workers dissuaded them, but they were countered by the refugees with wooden sticks and knives, and boarded the shore, stabbing four workers, Yao Desheng, Zhang Tianlong, Cai Yinshun, and Tang Wanyu, in the head, hands, feet, and other parts.

<h3>Young General Ma Jiyuan</h3>
<p>— Our Reporter Zhang Xianzhou</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Xi'an, 1st dispatch] Wherever our reporter went in eastern Gansu, the people, upon hearing the name of the 82nd Division, would almost immediately show friendliness and joy. When Ma Jiyuan was mentioned, they would unanimously recommend him to you, recounting the merits of Commander Ma. They said that the people and the military were truly cooperative. When the discipline of the troops was mentioned, they all said: "This army is good. They buy and sell fairly, don't live in civilian houses, and don't disturb the people." Ma Jiyuan is not a legendary hero. He is a twenty-eight-year-old young general. He is the only son of Qinghai Chairman Ma Bufang. From the first page of his life story until now, everything has gone smoothly. In China's Northwest, many people knew him as early as ten years ago, but it was only after the great victory in eastern Gansu this time that his fame spread throughout the country, and he gained attention.</p>
<p>1944 was a major turning point in his life. A young gentleman who had lived in the Northwest for a long time graduated for the first time from the first class of the Senior Officer Class of the Army University in Chongqing. This was a period of gestation for his future career and a new starting point for his later path. His classmates at the time included Song Xilian, Fan Hanjie, Huang Zhao, and Zhao Shoushan, the current "Deputy Commander-in-Chief of the Northwest People's Liberation Army" of the Communist bandits. According to himself, he was the worst student in that class. After graduating from the Army University, he returned to his troops and began to reform the small matters in the army.</p>
<p>On May 23rd, when the reporter visited his headquarters for the first time, he greeted everyone and led them to his office to sit down. It was a large room, with military maps and banners of Yu Ranweng hanging on the four walls, creating an elegant atmosphere. Among them were interspersed several small pieces of paper, written in Song-style type with Western maxims, such as "Genius never despises labor! - Stevens." There were several reports on the desk, along with two or three copies of Silren Screen, all of which fully demonstrated the owner's deep love for Western flavor. In that courtesy visit, although it only lasted a few tens of minutes, everyone talked very harmoniously. He was wearing a yellow wool military uniform and spoke with a strong Gansu accent.</p>
<p>The next afternoon, he chatted with everyone. According to himself, he liked riding horses and hunting. In the past, he was very fond of reading Turgenev's novels, but now his interest has shifted to the nation! He is a movie enthusiast. He said that he hadn't seen a movie for a long time. When he was in Chongqing, he could watch three movies a day. At the same time, he loves to sing, and every night after planning operations, he and his senior subordinates would sing loudly. He can sing Western songs and loves to dance local dances. What makes him love these things? It should be the aristocratic life of his childhood and the ethnicity of the Hui people. When talking about his family life, he laughed. His wives currently live in Xining. The first wife is his cousin, the direct younger sister of Commander Ma of a certain cavalry unit stationed in Xinjiang. They were engaged as children, arranged by their parents. She cannot read. Ma Jiyuan said with a smile: "Once, I sent her a letter asking why she didn't write back. As a result, the reply came with writing on the envelope and the stationery blank, with only a stamp on the lower left corner." When he was in Chongqing, he fell in love with Zhang Xunfen, a female staff member of the Foreign Exchange Management Committee, and later married her. Mrs. Zhang is from Nanjing and graduated from Huiwen Girls' High School. She also lives in Xining now. The reporter asked him which one he loved. He said, "I love them both." Another reporter probed from the side, asking him which boudoir he would go to first when he went home. He cleverly said: "I go to my mother first, because they are both there." This made everyone laugh. "Nine out of ten officials are afraid of their wives," he continued. "I also listen to my wife. For example, a month ago, I suddenly thought I should grow a mustache, so I grew a small 'eight' character mustache. I wrote a letter to Mrs. Zhang, with a small photo attached as proof. My wife immediately issued a 'decree', disagreeing with this matter, so I obeyed and shaved it off, and became younger again."</p>
<p>He said that he liked the United States, supported the People's Livelihood, hated the Soviet Union, and believed that one day the Soviet Union would fight with the United States. He agreed with a foreign colleague's question that "as long as there are humans, there will be war."</p>
<p>The victory in eastern Gansu was because the Communist bandits, after their defeat in Lingshan, wanted to return north and defeat Ma's troops to cover up their defeat. Ma Jiyuan could not deny that if it were not for General Hu Zongnan's troops pursuing north, he would have suffered even greater losses, but if eastern Gansu had not been blocked by them, the Communist bandits would have escaped even more.</p>
<p>The 82nd Division of the National Army was trained and cultivated by Ma Bufang. For more than ten years, it has been famous in the Northwest. In 1935, it eliminated more than 40,000 Communist bandits and shattered Xu Xiangqian's "international line" breakthrough. When Ma Jiyuan was 21 years old, he took over his father's mantle as commander of the army. After the victory, he was ordered to reorganize, and he was changed from army commander to division commander. Other than the name change, the original people and horses remained the same. Not only was the medicine not changed, but even the soup probably wasn't changed either.</p>
<h3>Funds for the Third Phase of the Shanghai-Suzhou Seawall Project Have Been Allocated</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Zhenjiang, 3rd dispatch] The Shanghai-Suzhou Seawall Project should proceed with the third phase of its plan this year, totaling 706 meters in length. According to news from Su Jianying: After the first batch of 30 billion yuan was allocated in May, a contract was signed with the Fuji Construction Company to purchase materials. The second batch of 70 billion yuan was allocated to Shanghai by US Aid to China in June, and the Songjiang and Taicang sections of the project are currently being planned. The third batch of 130 billion yuan is currently being negotiated. Dong Zanyao, Director of the Jiangsu Construction Department, went to Baoshan and other sections to inspect and returned to Zhenjiang on the 2nd. According to him, "The progress of the project is difficult to control due to price fluctuations. We are currently trying to use the estimated number of workdays as a standard and allocate funds according to actual needs."</p>
<h3>Iron-Fisted Politics in Zhejiang: From Shen Cheng-zhang to Chen Gong-qia</h3>
<p>— Our Special Correspondent Chu Yusheng</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Hangzhou, 3rd dispatch] In May in Jiangnan, pomegranate flowers are like fire, and as we move towards the height of summer, the resignation of Zhejiang Provincial Government Chairman Shen Cheng-zhang and the appointment of Chen Gong-qia have brought a sense of seeing off the old and welcoming the new.</p>
<p>Recalling Mr. Shen's words to reporters on the eve of his assumption of office: "Zhejiang is a healthy province, and everything is on track, so it is relatively easy to govern." However, after more than two years in Zhejiang, Mr. Shen developed the intention to resign. He once told reporters: "I used to like to drink wine, but now I don't drink it. I used to like to smoke, but now I don't smoke it. Lately, I haven't even been able to sleep well, and I know that my humble body is declining." When Mr. Shen took office, he also told reporters: "I am already over sixty years old, and President Chiang has asked me to govern his hometown. I can only do my best to repay his kindness."</p>
<p>During his time in Zhejiang, Mr. Shen himself could truly be described as "diligent in government." Immediately after arriving, he went to inspect the seawall, and afterwards, he kept running around in various counties, leaving his footprints in almost every county. Even though the roads were dilapidated, he still bumped along in a ten-wheeled truck. Upon arriving in each county, he inspected various agencies, held symposiums, and only went to sleep at 2 a.m., and then got up again at 7 a.m. to work. Such spirit, at his current age of sixty-six, is truly commendable.</p>
<p>Mr. Shen's work focus seemed to be to give universal attention to every cause. For example, in terms of governance, he advocated abolishing harsh taxes and levies and not entertaining superiors and foreign guests. Even when he himself inspected a county, he would pay for his own meals. As for construction, the seawall was repaired, farmland irrigation was carried out, and afforestation and production were all proceeding steadily. As for security, the defense zones of the provincial security teams were stipulated, and Siming and other places were designated as pacification zones. The county magistrates of the pacification zones were convened to plan security work. As for personnel, talent was trained by the provincial cadre training corps, and county magistrates were examined and registered. Regarding finance and land tax, he requested the central government to reduce the tax rate and strove to increase funding. He also paid attention to education, preventing student unrest, and giving speeches to students everywhere. As for the treatment of county-level public education personnel, he raised it to the level of issuing supplies and stipulating basic salaries for civil servants. During his tenure, his</p>
<p>most notable achievement was in farmland irrigation in the construction field. At that time, the Executive Yuan Relief and Rehabilitation Administration happened to have a branch office in Zhejiang, and Mr. Shen traveled everywhere, inspecting counties that needed irrigation construction. The two sides cooperated, using flour as work relief, and indeed did a lot of work. As for the criticisms that Mr. Shen received, they mainly concerned the issue of security. Because when Mr. Shen took office, the security situation did not feel serious, but today, many threats are felt. Therefore, it is said that Mr. Shen was questioned by many fellow villagers when he was in Nanjing.</p>
<p>In fact, the issue of security is related to the entire political issue. Because the entire political system has not come up with a way to cut through the Gordian knot, and coupled with rising prices and the difficulty of people's livelihoods, even a small spark will inevitably start a prairie fire if it is slightly incited. Therefore, if people in these relatively difficult and insecure places can be given a stable livelihood, their hearts will naturally be disgusted by chaos. I feel that it is somewhat unfair to criticize Mr. Shen for not putting in enough effort to maintain security. I believe that Mr. Shen's failure lies in giving universal attention to every cause and doing everything himself. Because he paid attention to every cause, he lacked a special solution to a specific problem. Because he did everything himself, his energy was limited, which made him feel tired and exhausted, and when a person is tired and exhausted, he only has the power to drag on. Some people say that Mr. Shen appointed many private individuals when he came to Zhejiang. I feel that this statement is also an exaggeration. After Mr. Shen took office, several provincial committee members did not cooperate and rushed to Nanjing to lobby, which eventually formed the provincial government. At the same time, among the county magistrates in the province, there were really only a small number of Mr. Shen's private individuals. Mr. Shen wanted to make a difference in Zhejiang and wanted to do things in a good direction, so he did not want to offend anyone and always tried to make everyone happy. The problem also lies in this point, because in trying not to offend anyone, he ended up offending people. Many people felt that during Mr. Shen's two years of governing Zhejiang, they did not feel his good points, nor did they feel his bad points.</p>
<p>Now, Mr. Chen Gongxia has come. After taking office, Mr. Chen told reporters that he would pay special attention to security and production. Among security and production, he seemed particularly interested in the latter and had a</p>
<p>beautiful vision, that is, the success of the hydropower station at the street entrance, the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway running from Jinhua to Wenzhou, and the formal navigation of the Qiantang River, which would definitely change the economic situation. Indeed, today when we talk about security, if we just rely on military force to win, it is really passive. We should develop economic undertakings and enrich people's livelihoods, so that everyone has food to eat and clothes to wear, which is considered active security work. Now, the hydropower generation, the opening of the Qiantang River, and the connection of the Jin-Wen Railway listed by Mr. Chen all have concrete prototypes. As long as we persevere and work hard, we can certainly succeed. However, to succeed in the above-mentioned undertakings, a large amount of money and manpower are needed. Mr. Chen once stated that after arriving in Zhejiang, he would requisition idle labor and idle capital, which is certainly welcomed by the general public, because reducing idle labor reduces consumption, and reducing idle capital indirectly suppresses prices. However, today, most of the people with idle labor and idle capital are wealthy and powerful, and the real ordinary people, such as the farmers in rural areas, have already reached the point of contributing money and labor. If Mr. Chen wants to requisition idle labor and idle capital, will it cause resentment among some wealthy and powerful people? We have always admired Mr. Chen's iron-fisted politics, and once he has made a decision, he will implement it earnestly, regardless of all difficulties, and must carry it through to the end. We eagerly look forward to the new chairman using the means of cutting through the Gordian knot to do something practical, so that Zhejiang can truly achieve a day of "peace and order."</p>
<h3>The Level of Domestic Films Has Improved, and They May Compete for Overseas Markets</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Hong Kong, 2nd Dispatch] King's Theater in Hong Kong, which specializes in premiering first-run films, has since yesterday hung a 24-inch large color photo of the domestic costume film "National Soul" in a location that dwarfs the display of foreign film stills, in its most eye-catching corridor, with a notice that it will soon be shown at the theater, which has aroused the interest of Chinese and Western people here. According to observations by people in the film industry: It is believed that Chinese films may soon rise in the international market. The question is whether the technical level of domestic films can rival Hollywood productions, and the Yonghua Film Company, which produced "National Soul," seems to have the above basic conditions.</p>
<h3>Two Bandits in Changshu Attempted to Escape and Were Killed</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Changshu, 12th Dispatch] The Yu Cheng District Anti-Bandit Command successively captured two Communist bandit criminals in Dongxiang, Xu Yonggen and Xu Jinhui (i.e., Lu Xiaokang's concubine). After interrogation, they volunteered to lead the way to arrest the bandit Bao Kuncai. On the night before last, personnel were dispatched to Jiyi Port. Unexpectedly, when they reached the 9th Bao area of ​​Meili Town, the two criminals took advantage of the dimness of the night and suddenly lunged forward, attempting to escape. Unable to catch up, they fired warning shots, hitting vital points and killing them on the spot.</p>
<h3>Bloodshed in Shenyang: Unexpected Disaster at an Engagement Feast, Suspicions of Revenge Killing and Love Killing</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Shenyang, 30th Dispatch] There have been many murders in Panyang recently, which indicates that the psychology of young men and women is developing in a distorted direction. At about 2:00 p.m. today, a confusing murder case occurred at the Taifeng Restaurant in the northern city. The female protagonist was Qiu Xiqing, a nineteen-year-old village girl with a lovely appearance. A grenade exploded at her engagement feast. She was originally scheduled to get married this Sunday. This was a nightmare she had never dreamed of. At a table of banquets, life developed to the extreme highs of comedy and tragedy.</p>
<p>The murderer was a soldier in his twenties, with long hair and a pale face. After killing the people, he committed suicide with a grenade, his lungs spilling out, blood and flesh flying everywhere. He died in this heroic manner. They all died blindly. When the reporter squeezed into the crowd to watch this tragedy, he only saw the four corpses covered in blood and flesh. The expressions of the people in the front row were very solemn. This is the symbol of humanity. After the so-called "life" storm, everything returns to stillness and silence.</p>
<p>This bizarre story took place on a rainy noon. A soldier customer came to Taifeng Restaurant, went upstairs and entered seat number four, ordered a plate of cold dishes and a doubt of white wine, and drank alone. Then he asked for fine wine and dishes, as if to relieve his sorrow. At about 1:00 p.m., he called the waiter and said that he was going to catch the 3:00 train and was going elsewhere. He was taking a nap now and asked the waiter to wake him up when the time came. Then he seemed to fall asleep.</p>
<p>Originally, in seats number two and three of the restaurant, Liu Hanwen (27 years old, from Jinzhou), a major director of the health team of the Second Regiment of the Northeast Garrison Command stationed in Fushun, and Qiu Xiqing (19 years old), a woman from Wujiabao Village, Shahe Township, were holding an engagement ceremony. More than a dozen relatives from both sides were present. Unexpectedly, after the banquet had just begun, a sudden disaster occurred. The soldier in the next seat threw a grenade in from the door with a loud bang, and gunpowder smoke flew everywhere. The soldier returned to his seat and blew himself up.</p>
<p>After the incident, the owner of the restaurant rushed to report to the police. After the police arrived, they immediately handled the aftermath and began to investigate the land court inspection office, which also sent prosecutors and forensic doctors to investigate. It was determined that the deceased were Qiu Xiqing (female), Wang Fugui (the woman's sister's husband), Tian Ziwen, Liu Hanwen's orderly, and the murderer. The injured included the matchmaker Wu Wang Rulan (female), Liu Hanwen, and Xu Encai (waiter at Taifeng Restaurant), all of whom were injured in their arms and legs. They were slightly injured and have been sent to the hospital.</p>
<p>The circumstances of this case seem to be a case of jealousy or revenge killing. It is said that there was another engagement banquet at Taifeng Restaurant that day, and the murderer was intoxicated and confused, and it is also possible that he killed the wrong people. However, the murdering soldier was not wearing any insignia, so there is no way to know which unit he belonged to and his name, making it difficult to find clues. It is said that when the woman was in her hometown, troops were stationed in her home, revealing a clue, which seems to be a love affair.</p>
<p>The woman's father, Qiu Wenhan, is an honest villager. After this tragedy, he has lost his mind, but he repeatedly said that his daughter was very well-behaved and had no improper affairs before her death. When the forensic doctor determined that the girl was no longer a virgin, the old man from the countryside firmly denied it, but in his distraught eyes, he revealed a grief more shameful than the death of his daughter.</p>
<h3>Soldiers in Shangrao Steal Guns, and the Entire Case Is Transferred to the Security Department for Interrogation</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Shangrao, 2nd Dispatch] A case of soldiers stealing guns from our army to aid bandits occurred in this county in the middle of last month. Liu Guihua, a sergeant squad leader of the recruiting regiment of the 205th Division of the Army stationed in Rao, stole a Canadian-made Sten submachine gun and ten magazines, as well as a military uniform top, from the division on the 13th and 17th of last month. On the 18th, Wu Guangmei, the transport platoon leader of the division, discovered the theft and reported it to the Shangrao Military Police. Later, when Platoon Leader Wu counted the number of people, he found that squad foot Liu Guihua was out and had not returned, so he was highly suspected. After interrogation, Liu confessed that he was used by the bandit Zhou Yishui and successively stole and sold guns and magazines, hiding them at Ying Zuguo's place. Personnel were dispatched to search Ying's home, and the entire case has been sent to the Security Command for handling.</p>

<h3>Changzhou Grain Administration: A Complete Mess, Many Loopholes</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Wujin, 2nd] In the past, the collection of land taxes in kind was like a "riddle" to the general public. Warehouse losses, storage losses, transportation losses, leakage losses, boat losses... countless unclear "losses," long-distance freight, short-distance freight, processing rates, leftover rice from processing, concentrated warehouse varieties of japonica, indica, and inferior rice, red-spotted rice, moldy grains, upper and lower grades, sacks, grain strings, settlement slips, so much trouble that it made everyone's head spin!</p>
<p>Changzhou, after suffering painful lessons, was unwilling to leave this "riddle" unsolved. Therefore, public opinion took notice, and the assembly specially organized an investigation committee. After three or four months of extensive inquiry, they finally cut open this mysterious tumor. Upon inspection, to everyone's surprise, it was full of rotten things—truly a complete mess!</p>
<p>First Investigation: Seeking Pearls in the Abyss. First, it was discovered that Lu Pinjin, secretary of the County Land and Grain Office and chief of the Third Section, had taken advantage of his position and his personal relationship with County Magistrate Weng Cheng to secretly instruct warehouse managers to transport over 4,400 *shi* of grain to the Taiheng Grain Store in Wuxi for processing. It was stipulated that each *shi* of 108 *jin* would yield 82 *jin* of rice, equivalent to 5 *dou* 4 *sheng* and 7 *he*. Ostensibly, the Changzhou Revitalization Association would handle the accounting. When the case was uncovered, 200 packages of brown japonica rice and over 930 packages of white japonica rice had already been shipped out, reportedly to be sold on the market for profit. This was completely illegal. After being reported, the Provincial Land and Grain Office also sent personnel to investigate and confirm the facts. Lu Pinjin and some transport staff were subsequently imprisoned. The main culprit, Lu Pinjin, relied on former County Magistrate Weng Cheng's intercession, falsely claiming he was released on bail to handle the handover. After being released, he fled without a trace, now implicating his guarantors. The case is still awaiting trial by the court. The general public believes that China's legal system is not strong enough and that "officials protect each other," so there will be no result. The matter had just begun, and the public already sensed a feeling of disappointment that it would be "much ado about nothing." However, this Lu Pinjin had followed Weng Cheng for eight or nine years, specializing in grain administration and understanding its intricacies, mastering all the ins and outs. This time in Changzhou, he intended to "deceive the heavens and cross the sea," but unexpectedly failed halfway. Once the matter was discovered, he cleverly shifted the responsibility to the clerks to evade punishment. Weng Cheng even spoke up for him, claiming he was wronged, but with incriminating evidence in hand, the facts were clear, and there was no room for sophistry. He had no choice but to take "the thirty-sixth stratagem: running is the best option." The assembly decided to conduct further investigation. Unfortunately for Lu Pinjin, he failed this time.</p>
<p>Secondly, Shou Xuefan, an employee of the Caoqiao Office, also brought in by County Magistrate Weng, transported grain to the city and delivered it to the Jinfeng Rice Mill, totaling over 1,400 *shi*.</p>
<p>The grain delivered by the villagers was all japonica rice, but when recorded at the mill, it was all changed to indica rice. At that time, the market price of japonica rice was higher, and indica rice was cheaper, with a difference of over 100,000 yuan per *shi*. It was easy to embezzle hundreds of millions of yuan. At the same time, Shou, a young man, was extravagant and wasteful. Taking advantage of his position, he also misappropriated over 200 *shi* of grain. After the incident, Shou was once detained but subsequently escaped while being transferred to the court. This case also awaits court trial. This explains many things: (1) The Land and Grain Office and its offices insisted that the villagers deliver as much japonica rice as possible, and the exchange of japonica and indica rice resulted in a significant amount, considering the total of hundreds of thousands of *shi* in the county. (2) Regardless of whether it was japonica or indica, the quality required from the villagers was uniformly high. Furthermore, superior quality grain was transformed into inferior broken rice with red spots, with a price difference of 100,000 to 200,000 yuan per *shi*. This manipulation was also a major source of profit. But in the end, rice was still rice, and the number of *dan* was still the number of *dan*, so there was no problem in official records. The unlucky one was Shou Xuefan, who was reported.</p>
<p>The problems with processing factories and designated warehouses were also serious. There were over twenty designated warehouses in Changzhou, including Tongren, Yuanfeng, Dafeng, Tianfeng, Hengfeng, Yang Dasheng, Yuyuan Cheng, and the Revitalization Association. Recently, it was discovered that Tianfeng and Hengfeng factories had misappropriated a total of 4,600 to 4,700 *shi* of grain. Dai Xueyu, the manager of Tianfeng, engaged in purely empty buying and selling, colluding with</p>
<p>grain official Lu Pinjin to use grain to establish Tianfeng Factory, to operate Yunfei Transportation Company, and to open Tianfengxiang Grain Store in Wuxi. After all this, he ran into bad luck, losing over 2,500 *shi* of grain. He is now imprisoned and has agreed to declare bankruptcy and compensate. This matter is certainly extensive, and the military law office is still continuing its investigation. Similarly, Hengfeng Factory misappropriated 1,200 *shi*, which has been confirmed. Jin Zhenyi, the person in charge, has been released on bail pending trial. He claims to have made up for the losses. Whether or not he has actually made up for them remains to be seen after the factory is audited. Whether other factories have misappropriated grain has not been investigated in detail, but at the very least, they have likely used it.</p>
<p>Secondly, the processing rate and leftover rice were also shrouded in darkness. According to regulations, each *shi* of 108 *jin* of grain should yield at least 5 *dou* and 2 *sheng* of rice. Using rice husks and broken rice as processing costs and short-distance transportation fees, according to general practice, 108 *jin* of grain should yield 5 *dou* and 4 or 5 *sheng* of rice. Apart from the regulated 5 *dou* and 2 *sheng*, at least 2 or 3 *sheng* of leftover rice could be obtained from each *shi* of grain. For the processing of hundreds of thousands of *shi*, this leftover rice would amount to thousands of *shi*, which is not a small amount. However, with officials, clerks, merchants, and evil people colluding with each other, they publicly declared that only 5 *dou* and 2 *sheng* were obtained. According to statistics, the leftover rice from processing in Changzhou in the 35th and 36th years was at least 10,000 *shi*. At a value of 15 million yuan per *shi*, the amount would be 150 billion yuan. This was the hard-earned money of countless people, all of which was embezzled. Who embezzled it? Of course, it involved a wide range of people, and everyone involved in grain administration was inevitably implicated in the corruption.</p>
<p>The people suffered greatly when paying land taxes in kind. The tax collectors were as urgent as fire, and when necessary, certain teams would be dispatched to assist.</p>
<p>The grain delivered had to be dry, full, and of good quality. If there was even a little sand, mud, or empty shells, there was no room for leniency. When weighing, the steelyard beam had to be lifted like a dragonfly's tail, with a floating weight of one or two *jin*, which was difficult to detect. In addition, there was an open increase of seven or eight *jin* or five or six *jin* per *shi*. If paying in cash, in addition to the market price of good grain, one had to add the equivalent of five or six *jin* or seven or eight *jin* of grain. And one had to deliver it to the designated concentration warehouse, where they would be harshly exploited, demanding endlessly, engaging in the most greedy corruption. Last winter, a villager in Changzhou encountered</p>
<p>the most tragic experience. He carried a *shi* of grain from Benniu to the city, but the office was closed, and they refused to accept it. The villager, having no relatives in the city and no money on him, had no choice but to guard his load of grain at the warehouse door, enduring hunger and cold, and freezing through the harsh winter night. Returning home the next day, he eventually succumbed to his injuries and died, leaving behind his wife and daughter! Can you not feel anything? In addition, there are countless other stories of blood and tears, all produced by this flawed policy of collecting taxes in kind, which cannot all be enumerated. Selling land to pay grain taxes is heard everywhere, which is truly unbearable to listen to.</p>
<p>The current grain administration has too many loopholes! For example, local county-level grain taxes are purchased at low prices, without any regard for fairness, with prices less than one-fifth of the market price. County-level grain taxes are bought up cheaply, disregarding the county's finances. In general, county expenses in southern Jiangsu are empty in June, July, August, and September. The people are impoverished, and the county is broke, but the suppression of rebellion and nation-building must be done. However, because there is no money, everything is deflated. Regarding the collection of land taxes in kind, the regulations for transportation fees are unreasonable. For example, in the 36th year, the transportation fee was only a few thousand yuan per *shi*. How could anyone be asked to transport grain for that amount? Storage losses, warehouse losses, transportation losses—everything should have an accurate statistical accounting to allow for reasonable, legal, and fair scientific management. Unfortunately, the grain administration authorities have no correct instructions, relying only on orders to do this and that. In many places, it is impossible for lower-level staff not to engage in corruption! How can this be?</p>
<p>The collection of taxes in kind for the 37th year is about to begin. If the system is not thoroughly reformed and innovation is not vigorously pursued, and everything remains the same as before, then, of course, many grain officials and tax clerks will be smirking, welcoming this opportunity to get rich, and many grain merchants will be laughing, brandishing their claws and teeth, taking the opportunity to collude and profit from this money-making business. The poor people will tremble again! In our opinion, generally speaking, today's grain administration is too difficult, with corruption at every level and problems at every stage. The corruption and problems are linked together. The current stage of grain administration is simply a large-scale experimental ground for corruption and bribery. How many people today can withstand the test? If the government does not actively correct this, it will be no different from driving countless officials, clerks, merchants, and people into the deep pit of corruption and bribery! The result will not only be that the future of grain administration is unthinkable, but also that the urgent tasks of suppressing rebellion and nation-building, and democratic constitutionalism, may not have anything worth writing about.</p>

<p>Weekly Economy. Edited by the China General Chamber of Industry and Commerce.</p>
<h3>General Prices: Deepening Economic Crisis; Authorities Striving to Salvage</h3>
<p>The great price surge of June was like a storm, continuing for four weeks. As of last week, it seemed to have temporarily paused. According to analysis, this was due to the following factors: (1) After the continuous sharp rise in prices, speculative funds were frozen in goods, and holders were unwilling to sell, preventing speculative funds from moving; (2) Prices in other cities also rose too sharply, speculative funds were absorbed by goods, and the source was reduced; (3) North China restricted the exchange of circulating certificates, reducing the flow of funds to the south.</p>
<p>Last week, as it was the end of June, and July 1st and 2nd were the periods for the semi-annual final settlement of accounts for all banks and firms, funds had to be balanced. Most major commodities lacked a market, so the entire market, except for the stock market which opened on the 3rd with "a sea of red," was relatively quiet and not much to mention. However, with the continuous inflation of currency and the deepening economic crisis, everyone was worried about the price trends after the "red opening" at the end of the week.</p>
<p>The authorities were alarmed by this round of price frenzy. The important measures that can be mentioned are as follows:</p>
<p>First, the Control Yuan, feeling that the rising prices needed to be stopped urgently, submitted a price correction proposal to the Executive Yuan on June 16th. By last week, the Executive Yuan responded, listing stabilization measures:</p>
<p>(1) Strengthening financial controls to prevent the indiscriminate issuance of promissory notes, so as to avoid credit expansion and stimulate prices.</p>
<p>(2) Promoting the sale of treasury bonds to tighten credit.</p>
<p>(3) Dispatching responsible personnel to North China to improve exchange methods, and selling materials in North China. Also, the Ministry of Food was ordered to issue emergency measures for adjusting food supplies, ordering foreign rice, and continuing to hold urban food rationing to stabilize public sentiment.</p>
<p>These few measures are just rehashes of old ideas, and do not offer any new solutions to the current price problem.</p>
<p>Second, on Tuesday, Deputy Executive Yuan President Zhang said: "The government's price controls are currently managed separately by relevant ministries based on their respective responsibilities, such as the Flower Control Committee and the Financial Control Bureau. Now, the government, in view of the severe price fluctuations, has ordered all relevant departments to strengthen the implementation of the original methods of control, and to submit detailed opinions, so that the Executive Yuan can coordinate and implement comprehensive controls at any time." Later, it was reported that President Weng had drafted concrete measures to stabilize prices and would present a report at a secret meeting of the Legislative Yuan at the end of the week. How the price problem, which seems to have reached a dead end, will be resolved remains to be seen with the implementation of the new measures! Third, the Shanghai authorities, in response to the rising prices, convened a meeting at the municipal government on the 26th and announced four emergency measures to be implemented immediately: (1) The trade associations for daily necessities such as food, cotton, yarn, edible oil, fuel, paper, and sugar in the city were ordered to report to the Social Affairs Bureau within three days on the transaction situation of their member merchants from the 15th of this month to the date of the report, including the quantity traded, the names of the buyers or merchants, and the prices, for verification.</p>
<p>(2) The trade association for warehouse and godown businesses in the city was ordered to report the names of the owners, quantities, and storage dates of the grain warehouses storing daily necessities. The municipal government will conduct thorough investigations, and those who operate outside the industry and store goods beyond the government's prescribed time will be severely punished.</p>
<p>(3) The Financial Management Bureau was ordered to convene the municipal government, the Social Affairs Bureau, the Police Bureau, the Audit Office of the Central Bank, etc., to thoroughly investigate the origins and destinations of bills and notes at the clearing house and various banks and firms. Those who use funds to hoard, speculate, or manipulate the market, or misappropriate public funds, will be severely punished.</p>
<p>(4) The city has a cotton reserve of 150,000 bales, including 57,000 bales held by the Textile Export Committee and 90,000 bales of US aid materials. The city is currently consulting with the Export Committee and plans to allocate this batch of cotton. Efforts are also being made to use the US aid portion, so the current cotton panic can be alleviated. After this decision, it has been gradually implemented. What the results will be remains to be proven by the facts.</p>
<p>Fourth, the authorities' policy of selling materials in the past has mostly been concentrated in Shanghai. Starting last week, the authorities sold over 1,800 bags of flour for the first time in Tianjin, priced at 6.5 million to 9.4 million yuan per bag, and sold over 2,000 *jin* of Hankou rice. They continued to sell afterwards. It is said that by the end of the week, a total of 7,000 bags of flour had been sold. Selling materials naturally has a decisive effect on stabilizing prices, but based on the experience of selling in Shanghai, if one cannot control sufficient quantities of goods, set stable prices, and furthermore, if the techniques used are improper, it may instead induce speculators and contribute to rising prices. This is something that should be considered when selling materials in other cities.</p>
<p>Fifth, in order to prevent prices from rising again after the "red opening" on the 3rd, the Shanghai authorities convened a meeting on Friday by the commander of the garrison department, inviting the heads of the municipal government, military, police, and financial institutions, to discuss and decide on five emergency measures:</p>
<p>(1) Controlling currency and tightening credit, the main points of which are to limit the amount of cash each person can bring to Shanghai to no more than 200 million yuan, and to suggest that the Central Bank restrict withdrawals and deposits.</p>
<p>(2) Controlling prices and searching for hoarded goods, setting a deadline for registering inventory and inspecting warehouses.</p>
<p>(3) Public sale of food to stabilize rice prices, accelerating preparations for public food expenses and implementing comprehensive rationing.</p>
<p>(4) Banning over-the-counter securities trading to maintain normal exchange within the stock exchange.</p>
<p>(5) Secretly investigating speculative manipulators in various industries, and after investigating and finding them, in addition to specially important cases where other punishment measures are determined, general offenders will also be sent to special criminal courts for handling. Resorting to the police and military to stabilize prices is a sign of an emergency situation, and may be effective for a time, but the crisis cannot be fundamentally resolved. Therefore, how to properly guide and rescue the situation is the urgent responsibility of the central authorities, and also the key to the success or failure of the cabinet.</p>

<p>(Note: The grain market last week was temporarily closed due to orders and the semi-annual interest payment period for banks, resulting in a three-day closure, so the market situation is incomplete. This association's wholesale price index for food last week generally used over-the-counter bids.)</p>
<h3>Currency and Finance</h3>
<p>(1) Bank Dark Interest Rates</p>
<p>Wednesday of last week was the last day of June, and Thursday and Friday were public holidays following the semi-annual closing of accounts for banks, so the information on currency and finance in this period only covers up to Wednesday.</p>
<p>Last week was the end of June, and not only did banks in the city face a major closing of accounts, but banks in other cities also had to make this semi-annual settlement. Therefore, while there was an urgent need to collect funds in this city, there were also few speculative funds arriving from other cities. The tight credit in the city last week was mainly due to this reason.</p>
<p>First, regarding dark interest rates, on Monday of last week, they were between 3.3% and 3.45%. On Tuesday, they rose to 3.6%, and on Wednesday, they were as high as 4.5%, which shows the popularity of funds. As for over-the-counter interest rates in the securities market, they were also about 5%.</p>
<p>The total difference between deposits and withdrawals of national banks from Monday to Wednesday was 2314.6 billion. If we deduct the approximately 900 billion in fixed deposits of commercial banks at the Central Bank during the same period, the actual net inflow of national banks was over 1400 billion.</p>
<p>Foreign banks maintained a high amount of net deposits throughout the week. From Monday to Wednesday, in just three days, the net deposits were 2262.6 billion. The destination of these funds is noteworthy.</p>
<p>(2) Domestic and Foreign Exchange Rates</p>
<p>Last week, in the foreign exchange market, the Hong Kong exchange rate continued to shrink. 100,000 yuan in legal tender was equivalent to 0.14 Hong Kong dollars. The market price of US dollars in Hong Kong was between 5.44 and 5.45 yuan. The exchange certificate continued to rise. At the end of the previous week, it was only 1.46 million yuan, but by Monday of last week, it had reached 1.85 million yuan, and by Tuesday and Wednesday, it had risen above the 2 million mark.</p>
<p>The domestic exchange rates of banks in the city saw the Guangzhou exchange rate rise because of rumors that the authorities would open up exchange in South China. The exchange premium rose from 250 yuan at the end of the previous week to 400 yuan at the beginning of last week. Although it fell back to 350 yuan on Tuesday, it rose again to 400 yuan on Wednesday, which shows a clear trend of funds transferring to other cities.</p>
<p>The Xiamen exchange premium was 80 yuan on Monday and Tuesday, and also rose to 100 yuan on Wednesday. The Yujiang exchange rate was at par on Monday, 20 yuan on Tuesday, and rose to 30 yuan on Wednesday. The Hankou exchange premium rose from 180 yuan on Monday to 200 yuan on Wednesday. Due to the rumor that Northeast circulating certificates were no longer exchangeable and the opening of Shanghai exchange in North China, the Tianjin exchange premium decreased from 100 yuan on Monday to 20 yuan. However, on Wednesday, the Tianjin exchange premium rose back to 50 yuan, which also indicates the large number of funds coming south.</p>
<p>Commercial banks generally lacked funds, interbank lending was frequent, and there was even a shortage of cash. The clearing results for banks after number 60 also showed a deficit of over 426 billion in three days, which further proves the tight credit situation.</p>
<p>(3) Chinese and Foreign Stock Markets</p>
<p>At the beginning of the week, due to rumors of tight credit and the authorities' four new measures to suppress prices, people were worried. Yong Yarn initially opened and fell sharply to 4,950 yuan, and after several rounds of rising, finally closed at 5,240 yuan. Meiya opened trading on new shares for the first day, rising by 185 yuan. Lian was also newly listed and reached the price limit of 17 yuan. The rest were lower than the previous week.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, as the end of June approached and the stock exchange was closed for three days, there were too many floating shares to bear the interest burden, and many people sold at highs. The market showed a trend of being unable to rise. Yong Yarn lingered at a low level throughout the day, falling to close at 5,230 yuan. Among the unpopular stocks, Zhongyi, Lian, Huaxin, and Xinhua all reached the price limit.</p>
<p>Wednesday was the end of June, and according to regulations, the Shanghai Stock Exchange was closed for the first half of the accounting year. July 1st and 2nd were the closing days for various industries, and the banks were closed, so there were no transactions.</p>
<p>The "red opening" at the end of the week had many pieces of positive news, and people were exceptionally excited. All stocks rose to the price limit, resulting in a "sea of red."</p>
<p>The foreign stock market opened at the beginning of the week, and because it was near the end of the month, credit was gradually tightening, and the Hong Kong exchange rate was also flat, foreign stocks unanimously retreated slightly. Jardine Yarn fell to 11 million yuan, and Hutchison Whampoa reached the 30 million mark. Union Insurance was 1.9 million yuan lower than last week, and Ye Guang was flat.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, because reports said that the authorities were banning foreign stock trading, people generally adopted a wait-and-see attitude. Trading was delayed until 11 a.m. The market uniformly tended to be sluggish. Jardine Yarn fell back to 10.6 million yuan. Union Insurance was quoted at 11.5 million yuan, and Hutchison Whampoa fell below the 30 million mark, with transactions at 29 million.</p>
<p>Wednesday was the end of June, and was a holiday, similar to the Chinese stock market. July 1st and 2nd were the days for the semi-annual final settlement, and there was no trading.</p>
<h3>Dramatic Increase in Tung Oil Production in the United States</h3>
<p>[New York Shipping News] Tung oil production has gradually become one of the important industries in the United States. In the past, the tung trees planted in the United States were mostly concentrated in the southeastern states. Now, all the tung trees in these areas have grown strong and provide ample shade, and the total annual production of tung fruit is in the tens of thousands of tons. This is vastly different from the situation thirty or forty years ago when seedlings, barely a foot tall, were first transplanted from China to the United States.</p>
<p>At that time, the relevant American companies eagerly bought land and transplanted these tung tree seedlings from China. They also encouraged investors to provide financial support. However, the experimental results were poor and ultimately failed. The planted tung trees did not grow significantly, while surrounding weeds flourished. As a result, many operators abandoned their original plans, unwilling to cultivate and fertilize, and left them to grow or die on their own.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, a small number of investors with faith in emerging industries, in order to compensate for their financial losses, began to cultivate them using more scientific methods. Thanks to their redoubled efforts, tung forests providing ample shade have now emerged on the dry soils of the southwestern Mississippi River basin.</p>
<p>Recently, tung oil merchants held a meeting of the Tung Oil Association in the Mississippi Gulf port in the United States. Chairman Gai Aide presented a report stating:</p>
<p>This year's tung oil production has increased by 22% compared to last year. Although various aspects still need assistance, the tung oil industry is moving forward.</p>
<p>Tung oil has many uses in industry, including paints, enamels, varnishes, electrical insulation, waterproofing, automobiles, brake bands, and soaps, all of which can use it as a raw material. It can also be used to fill gaps in the lead-coated wings of airplanes due to its strong drying properties, which are unmatched by other drying oils.</p>
<p>The tung planting area in the United States now extends to six states, from Georgia and West Virginia to Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana, and eastern Texas.</p>
<p>One of the difficulties encountered by the American tung oil industry last year was the large-scale import of Chinese goods without tariff restrictions. The American Oil Merchants Association has repeatedly requested assistance from the US government to impose an import tax of 2.5 US cents per pound on tung oil imported from China, in order to restrict the sales of Chinese tung oil in the United States. The tung oil tax bill has now been rejected by the US government, and the previous customs practice of requiring guarantee money for our tung oil imports has been abolished.</p>
<p>The US tung fruit harvest in 1948 is estimated to be about 90,000 tons.</p>
<h3>Silk Production Has Increased Annually for Three Years</h3>
<p>According to the Silk Guidance Association: Since the victory, the China Silk Company and the Silk Association have successively guided the promotion of the silk industry, which has been going on for three years. Through the joint efforts of various provinces, silk production has increased annually. In the 35th year, the amount of raw silk reeled with government loans was 6,345 dan for spring silk, 667 dan for dried cocoon silk, and 325 dan for autumn silk, totaling 7,337 dan. The output of local silk in other places was about 12,000 dan, totaling about 20,000 dan.</p>
<p>In the 36th year, the spring silk reeled with government loans was 9,174 dan, the autumn silk was 49 dan, the raw silk reeled with self-raised funds was about 500 dan, the local silk was about 9,000 dan, and the dried cocoon silk was about 2,000 dan, totaling about 21,000 dan.</p>
<p>This year’s spring loans, together with the silk reeled by cooperatives, are estimated at about 21,000 dan, local silk is about 15,000 dan, and dried cocoon silk is about 4,000 dan, which is estimated to produce about 31,000 dan. The autumn cocoons of this year are not yet included. It is rumored that this year's silk production is 420,000 dan, which is untrue. Even in Japan, the most abundant silk-producing country, the annual output is only about 200,000 dan.</p>

The school must first check the eyesight of the candidates and whether they have close relatives, color blindness, disabilities, nerve, heart weakness, or infectious diseases before registration. If they fail the physical examination, they will not be allowed to participate in the written examination. Although the school has dormitories on East Changzhi Road, new students will not be able to live there this year, so applicants will probably be limited to those from this city. After enrollment, students who fail one-third of their subjects will be asked to withdraw from the school. Because each graduate of the school is in high demand by various shipping companies, the demand exceeds the supply, so the employment problem is relatively easy to solve.</p>
<p>Taxation Academy</p>
<p>In the past, the Ministry of Finance Taxation Academy was responsible for its own enrollment. However, since the spring of last year, it has been changed to be handled by the Examination Committee for Senior and Junior Taxation Personnel of the Ministry of Finance. The committee recruits four types of taxation personnel: business, direct, goods, and customs. If they pass the examination, the new students of customs will be assigned to the school by the Ministry of Finance for training.</p>

<h3>Public Exhibition Cup Basketball Finals: Xinjian Wins Championship; Defeats John 42-29; Awards Ceremony Held on the Morning of the 7th</h3>
<p>The Municipal Stadium organized the Public Exhibition Cup Secondary School Basketball League to promote secondary school basketball and encourage competition. Since it was unveiled in late April, group matches have been held first. There were 11 groups in the men's division and two groups in the women's division. Most groups had five teams, for a total of 68 teams. After two months of competition, all group champions were gradually produced. The finals have been held for the past three weeks. The men's division adopted an elimination system, and the women's division adopted a three-game two-win system. The women's division champion has been won by Minli Girls' Middle School. Yesterday afternoon at 2:00 p.m., the men's teams Xinjian and John competed. More than a thousand people watched the game. Some of the audience broke into the basketball court, affecting the game. After persuasion, they withdrew, and the game started at 2:45 p.m. The cheerleading teams of the two schools cheered each other on, and the atmosphere was very tense. As a result, Xinjian defeated John 42-29 to win the championship. The cup competition ended completely. The awards ceremony is scheduled to be held at 9:00 a.m. on the 7th at the Municipal Middle School Joint Graduation Ceremony. Speaker Pan will be invited to present the awards.

<p>Xinjian Leads All the Way</p>
<p>The game started at 2:45 p.m. Liu Hesheng was the referee. Zhang Naihao of Xinjian broke the basket first and scored two points. Xu Shuyuan of Gangzhi committed a foul. Hu Huichong of John missed the penalty. Wu Hanwen of Xinjian scored. Ma Jinsheng returned the favor. Xinjian led 4-2 and was smooth sailing all the way. At 9-4, John called a timeout and replaced Bai Xianheng with Ding Tie, but it was ineffective. Hanwen scored. Zhang Naihao made all his free throws, and John trailed further behind at 13-4. The generals quickly cheered up. As expected, Jun Bing and Huichong scored one after another, closing the gap to 15-10. At this time, Xin also would not allow them to be unrestrained. Hanwen made a free throw, and the champion probed in, making it 18-10. John replaced Ding Tie with Bai Xianheng again due to injury. Xinjian also replaced Xu Shuyuan with Ji Qiwu. John took the opportunity to rise quickly. Wan Xinghai and Ma Jinsheng scored one after another. The first half ended with Xinjian leading 18-14 by two goals.</p>
<p>John's Effort to Catch Up Proves Ineffective</p>
<p>Switching sides to fight again, Zhang Naihao of Xinjian retired, and Xu Shuyuan drove into the court. Not long after the start of the game, Ma Jinsheng of John had leg cramps twice and called a timeout. Fortunately, he recovered quickly, and the team made the first contribution, but Xinjian's offensive remained undiminished. Xu Shuyuan and Liang Xiongxiao frequently scored. John replaced his generals many times, but it was ineffective. The battle situation has reached its peak. After 27-18, Wang Junbing of John scored consecutively, and Ma Jinsheng shot long and broke the basket, making it 27-24, closing the gap again. Xu Shuyuan of Xinjian made two free throws, and Ma Jinsheng made a free throw to pull back three points. At this point, John gradually showed fatigue. The generals of Xinjian were still fierce, and the overall situation fell into the hands of Xinjian. When the statutory time was up, Xinjian defeated John 42-29 to win the Public Exhibition Cup Men's Division Championship, and John retreated to the runner-up.</p>

<p>[Reuters, Hong Kong, 4th] The Chinese World Games basketball team defeated the Xingdao team 45-28 here yesterday.</p>
<h3>Teachers College Swimming Pool Opens</h3>
<p>The swimming pool of the Municipal Teachers College at Wusong Road and Wujin Road in this city is scheduled to open at 10:00 a.m. today (5th). The official opening period is July 15th. The swimming pool of the school has health education value. The principal of the school, Zhou Shang, and the director of physical education, Ma Fengge, will guide swimming learning and implement sunbathing methods. Children, youths, and public and educational personnel are welcome to attend. The ticket prices are especially low, ranging from 40,000 yuan to 100,000 yuan in three types.

<h3>World Tennis Queen, American Blonde, Bai Lu Shows Off Her Skills, Sweeping Three Championships, Wimbledon Tennis Championships Close</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Wimbledon, 3rd] Miss Bai Lu, the 25-year-old blonde American women's singles champion, won the singles, doubles, and mixed doubles titles in the Wimbledon finals today, rising to the throne of the world's tennis queen. Her opponent, Miss Hurd, was defeated in the singles, doubles, and mixed doubles. The men's doubles, Brougni of Australia, who was defeated by Kenburg in the singles finals, and his partner Segman, won the doubles championship. Brougni also won the mixed doubles championship with Miss Bai Lu. The audience was crowded today, and Queen Mary, the Duchess of Kent, Prime Minister Attlee, and others all attended.</p>
<p>Women's Singles Finals Miss Bai Lu defeated Miss Hurd 6-1, 8-6 in the finals, performing brilliantly, and the skills were comparable to the best women's singles finals performance in the history of Wimbledon's Central Court. Miss Hurd has reached the finals in this and the previous session, but unfortunately she was defeated in the finals. Last session, she was defeated by Miss Osborne (i.e. Mrs. DuPont) in the finals. The battle with Bai Lu today lasted for an hour and a half. Both sides hit the ball extremely hard. Bai Lu's ability to control the ball was the decisive factor in her victory, but Hurd had to fight to the end for every point.</p>
<p>Women's Doubles Women's doubles finals, Miss Bai Lu and Mrs. DuPont defeated Miss Hurd and Mrs. Dutter 6-3, 3-6, 6-3. The former was the women's doubles champion in 1946, and the latter was the women's doubles champion in the previous session.</p>
<p>Men's Doubles Men's doubles Brounwich and Segman defeated American Tang Bulang and Moloe 5-7, 7-5, 7-5, 9-7 to win the championship. Tang Bulang's performance was abnormal, with many mistakes. Not only did he not help Moloe, but Moloe was controlled by him. If Tang Bulang's performance was normal, they could have won. In addition to winning the first set 7-5, they also took the lead 5-3 in the third and fourth sets.</p>
<p>Mixed Doubles The mixed doubles competition was fierce. Although Brounwich and Bai Lu defeated Segman and Miss Hurd 6-2, 3-6, 6-3, the situation was dangerous and the victory was not easy.</p>
<h3>Wrestling Demonstration Conference: Wang Wending Overwhelms Zhou Songyou</h3>
<p>The first Shanghai Wrestling Demonstration Conference was held at the Yokohama Bridge Jingwu General Association at 9:00 a.m. yesterday. More than 500 spectators filled the Jingwu Fitness Room, and the scene was unprecedented. First, the chairman delivered an opening speech, and then the competition began. The referee was Song Zhenfu. The first pair was Zhang Yongfa vs. Zhang Caiming in the Light C grade. Caiming was short and small and could not withstand Yongfa's bravery. The battle situation was one-sided. Zhang Yongfa's victory was not difficult. Yu Hongbiao, one of the five tigers who represented this city in the National Wrestling Competition in the Light B grade, actually forfeited to Zhang Qiao. It is said that Hongbiao was discouraged after failing to score in the National Games. This time, he signed up but did not appear on the court, probably because he was intensifying his practice and secretly hiding his skills in preparation for the Shanghai Wrestling Championship in mid-October to show off his skills. In another pair, Sheng Dahong vs. Tong Yongfu, Dahong kicked his feet quickly and moved quickly. Yongfu lost to the kicking feet three times in a row, and became a failure gene. In the Light A grade, Quan Guoliang, the third runner-up in the National Games, also forfeited to Zhang Guiping. In another pair, the battle between Wang Wending and Songyou was wonderful. Wending's technique was sophisticated, and his feints were especially brilliant. Ju Songyou was able to support without defeat in the first and second rounds, but in the end, Wang Wending's wit was extraordinary, and Zhou Songyou lost by one fall.</p>
<h3>Tennis A League: Green Light Wins Enpai</h3>
<p>In the tennis league A group, yesterday was the third match. Green Light defeated Enpai 13-2 at its own field. Green Light lost two points only in the sixth pair, and the rest won by straight sets. The match between Lianmei and Youlian was postponed due to wet ground. The result of Jinlan vs. Zhonghua will be reported tomorrow. In the second match of the B group, Guangming defeated Lianmei 8-7, and Green Light also defeated Meiting by one point, and the situation was very even. Jinkuan defeated Bixun 9-6, which was also quite tense. The rest were one-sided. The results are recorded below:</p>
<p>Central Wins Zhangyuan 13-2</p>
<p>Guangming Wins Lianmei 8-7</p>
<p>Jinlan Wins Bixun 9-6</p>
<p>Tiyun Wins Railway 12-3</p>
<p>Green Light Wins Meiting 8-7</p>
<p>Shanghai Wins Zhonghua 13-2</p>
<p>In addition, in the first replay, Shanghai defeated Tiyun 9-6. There are still four groups that need to be completed within the day. According to Green Light, it is hoped that the Chinese B team will go to the association at 4:00 p.m. today for the replay.</p>
<h3>Baseball Exhibition Game, Part Three: Red Sox Play US Military League Today; Yesterday's Game Postponed Due to Rain, Replay Tomorrow</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] Part two of the baseball exhibition game between the Manila Red Sox and the All-Star Team could not be held due to the torrential rain yesterday morning. The organizer has decided to postpone it to tomorrow (6th) and hold it at the same time and place. The lineup of the All-Star Team has been announced by the leader Tang Jing. Yu Changluan, the Chinese pitcher who performed well in the first game, was still not listed as a candidate, which is puzzling. The team will play with a lineup that is just a cosmetic change. The Philippine team can hardly be threatened and will sweep Shanghai.</p>
<p>This afternoon at 3:00, the Red Sox will still meet with the Military League at the racecourse according to the original order. In another scene, the traditional Independence Day commemorative match will be played by the Amateur Baseball Association at the US Military Academy against the US Navy, starting at 3:00 p.m.</p>

<h3>Reader's Opinion: Suggesting Improvements to Passenger Vehicle Services by Two Railway Bureaus</h3>
<p>Mr. Editor: The long lines of cars refueling a few days ago, though temporarily gone, remind us that gasoline is obtained with foreign exchange and is still very valuable. Those in charge of vehicles should consider how to use them more effectively for the benefit of the country and its people. However, there are many strange things in the world that are beyond our expectations. The passenger pick-up vehicles of the Beijing-Shanghai Railway are one example. These vehicles are often seen going back and forth in the city, but they are sparsely populated with few passengers. Sometimes there are no passengers at all except for the ticket seller. A few days ago, the reader encountered one of these vehicles on Xizang Road. Several people got off with luggage because the trams and buses were too crowded at the time, so they took the vehicle to Jing'an Temple Road. At the same time, several people wanted to get on the vehicle, but the ticket seller refused to let them on. The passenger pick-up vehicle refuses to pick up passengers, but insists on driving around in the busy streets, wasting every drop of sweat and every drop of gasoline. This is truly unfathomable. I imagine it is not to show off wealth and deliberately make fun of the citizens of Shanghai! The reader is not clever enough to figure out the reason, so I kindly request your newspaper to uncover the truth and hope the Beijing-Shanghai Railway will give me a satisfactory answer. Sincerely, I wish you good health. Reader Song Botong, July 3rd.</p>

<h3>Argentina's "Peron Dynasty"</h3>
<p>— Lei Ying</p>
<p>An American tourist was eating in a restaurant in the capital of Argentina. He saw that there were as many as twenty-eight kinds of ribs on the menu, so he casually ordered a "small rib." A few minutes later, the "small" rib came, a full two inches thick and fourteen inches long! It was also thickly coated with white lard, weighing at least four ounces.</p>
<p>He was very satisfied with the meal, and even more pleasantly surprised when he paid the bill. The prices here were several times cheaper than in the United States!</p>
<p>The whole world is suffering from famine, but Argentina has plenty of food. Rice, wheat, and meat can be exported in large quantities, making it the envy of people all over the world. Argentina itself is well aware of this, and Argentine President Peron is making full use of this weapon, moving step by step towards becoming a Latin American dictator.</p>
<p>Indeed, Peron is already the dictator of Argentina, but the methods he employs are much more sophisticated than those of Hitler and his ilk.</p>
<p>What enables him to control Argentina's wealth is the "Argentine Trade Bureau," abbreviated as I.A.P.I., which has enormous power.</p>
<p>A farmer is happily watching his abundant fields when a civil servant comes over and pats him on the arm:</p>
<p>"Congratulations, congratulations, this year's harvest is really good."</p>
<p>The farmer happily thanks him for his concern. The civil servant says with a smile:</p>
<p>"The government has decided to buy all your harvest for one dollar and thirty-five cents per bushel. If you don't have time to harvest, can we help you? Sir, this is entirely to help you!"</p>
<p>When the old farmer hears that he can only sell at such a low price, he can't help but get anxious. But what's the use? They are I.A.P.I.!</p>
<p>The general prices of goods in Argentina are indeed very low, but when exported to foreign countries, the prices are shockingly high. All transactions are controlled by the Trade Bureau. One-third of the meat currently needed by the United Kingdom is shipped from Argentina, and Argentina supplies more than one-half of the grains. In addition, Italy, France, Greece, and other Latin American countries have to reluctantly allow themselves to be exploited in order to get help from Argentina. A large portion of the loans given to various countries in the Marshall Plan ended up in Peron's pocket. Not only that, Peron also demands various political concessions from his customers. Recently, Bolivia rejected his demands, and as a result, ships carrying food to Bolivia suddenly mysteriously "ran aground" for several months; as soon as Bolivia conceded, the grain ships immediately "escaped danger." Uruguay also resisted once, and suffered the same fate.</p>
<p>Argentina's newspapers are all under government control. One newspaper refused to give in and criticized the government's policies. As a result, the finance department of the Trade Bureau suddenly sent people to the newspaper to check the accounts, saying that the accounting methods were incorrect and fined them a three-day suspension of publication. Then, the electrical business department of the Trade Bureau came and said that the electrical wires in the newspaper office were not installed correctly and the newspaper had to suspend publication for seven days. Then, the workers' welfare department of the Trade Bureau sent people to investigate, saying that the ventilation equipment in the typesetting room was not correct and the publication had to be suspended for a month... After half a year of this, the newspaper authorities had no choice but to change their attitude.</p>
<p>Peron also kept a close eye on the education sector. Professor Hu Yang was anti-government, so Peron suddenly announced that professors who were fifty-five years old this year had to retire. The fifty-five-year-old Hu Sai had no choice but to obey the order and resign. But the following week, the person who replaced Hu Sai was an old professor who was sixty-two years old and was "Peron's man."</p>
<p>But the people of Argentina do not hate Peron. They say in private: "Peron himself is not bad, but the people around him are really bad—especially 'she.'"</p>
<p>"She" is Mrs. Peron. She is noble and beautiful, with a head of golden blonde hair. She was originally a not-so-famous actress, but was suddenly appreciated by Peron and became Peron's mistress, and then officially married Peron in 1945. In fact, Mrs. Peron does not interfere with Peron's policies. Originally, she herself also had a "small court." The high officials of the Peron government not only had to be loyal to Peron, but also frequently came and went between this "small court," competing to gain favor. She also ran a newspaper that praised her every day.</p>
<p>But she is also somewhat uneasy. She knows that all good things must come to an end. However, she said: "If I fall, no one else can stand up. You just wait and see!"</p>
<h3>The Beautiful Mrs. Peron</h3>
<h3>Medicine</h3>
<p>— Qian Wen</p>
<p>The so-called Shen Nong's Herbal Classic consists of three volumes, with 365 types of medicine. Liang Tao Hongjing doubled it, Tang added 114 more, Song added again, and by the Ming dynasty, this old version had 1,518 types of medicine. Li Shizhen compiled the Compendium of Materia Medica, adding 374 types, combining with the old ones to make 1,892 types, which is enough. Qing Zhao Xuemin compiled a supplement, adding 884 types. Chinese medicine is not like Han Xin's command of troops. These 2,776 flavors are specially prepared for selection. A prescription may only match four or five flavors. Medicine shops also do not have all of them, so patients often have to seek medicine from many places.</p>
<p>The old version has 2,935 attached prescriptions, increased by 8,161, for a total of 11,096 prescriptions. Attached prescriptions are used for reference, but Zhang Shaotang's preface to the revised version says, "It can be used for checking medicine, but it cannot be said that the contained prescriptions are sufficient to cure diseases." Since not all prescriptions are usable, why add them indiscriminately? Just talking about medicine, how many of these 2,700+ things are truly capable of curing diseases? In the future, I think there will be no more additions. If there are, it will only be waiting for the discovery of special new drugs. If additions continue endlessly, even if Shen Nong were to be reborn, he would not be able to identify them all.</p>
<p>The world says that medicine is about intention. The use of medicine means that rotten and stinky things can be transformed into magic. If you are competing for magic, then nothing cannot be used as medicine. Bedbugs, human lice, broken pens, waste paper, or they may indeed be useful; there are those who capture white clouds in the mountains and put them in a secret room, breathing them in. This is just a game, but this method is also good when the air is too dry. Burning filial sons' shirts to ashes and applying them to the face can treat facial [conditions]. Taking from the fact that it is made of ramie cloth, or it is also reasonable, but the dust from a widow's bedside mixed with oil is effective in treating ear sores. Why must the dust be sought from a widow's bed? Burning the ashes of a rope used for suicide and mixing it with medicinal water to treat sudden madness, its effect is in the medicine. If it is said that rope ash is usable, why must it be a rope used for suicide? Burning the ashes of a rope used to tie pigs in the twelfth lunar month and mixing it with water to treat children's crying from fright, it is difficult to explain the reason. Mixing mud from the soles of shoes with water to treat not being accustomed to the water and soil is very dangerous and must not be tried. As for saying that during a popular epidemic, taking the clothes of the first patient and steaming them on a steamer will prevent the whole family from being infected, this is nothing more than a method of disinfection to prevent infection. Placenta, the umbilical cord has become waste, it is usable, if you say human bones, skulls, mummies, human monsters (teratomas) are usable, then it is a big problem. Even saying that human genitals, human testicles, human blood, human flesh can be used as medicine, I don't know where to get it?</p>
<p>Zhao Xuemin said that Li Shizhen's Compendium of Materia Medica, in the human section, "is not said to help the world, but to incite evil," so he deleted this section from his book. However, Zhao's book still lists human aphids. Human aphids are maggots from dead people. They are found in coffins in corpse-raising fields, so they are considered usable, and it is also noted that they must be obtained from undertakers in corpse-raising fields to show that it is legal. But he also said, "Then there are unscrupulous people who sneak into the coffin storage place and steal coffins," because if you ask the undertaker and can't get them, there will inevitably be those who are greedy for heavy profit and steal coffins. This thing is said to be able to treat leprosy, which is still based on the idea of "using humans to treat humans." Leprosy cannot be cured, people know it, but human nature loves life. After hearing this saying, patients will definitely seek a trial in the hope of a miracle effect. Guangzhou once had a case of cooking and eating infant corpses. Although the perpetrators did not kill for profit, destroying the corpse is also not allowed by law. The people are poor and suffer from this evil disease, recognizing this as a ray of hope, which is truly pitiful. The downfall of heresy to this point, Zhao did not think about it. The entry of human into the record is also enough to inspire good. The saying that human blood can cure consumption is still very popular among the people, and Lu Xun took it as a theme, which became a moving novel.</p>
<h3>The Tempering of Works</h3>
<p>— Lianhu</p>
<p>Writing is not an easy task, although writing can be helped by inspiration, but inspiration is nothing more than a flash of wisdom that the author occasionally has in a certain environment and is fleeting. It is not something that can be obtained at any time and in any place. Even if you have inspiration, except for a very few exceptions, it is still difficult to obtain the highest results. The author must be penetrating and insightful, throw themselves into the depths to sift through the mud and pick up pearls, and put in a lot of hard work before they can obtain "the most exquisite image" and achieve the realm of perfection. The following are stories of several great writers struggling to write:</p>
<p>Flaubert often described the hardships of "Madame Bovary" in his letters:</p>
<p>"I don't know why I'm angry today, maybe it's because of my novel. This book always can't be written, I feel more tired than moving mountains, sometimes I really want to cry. Writing a book requires superhuman willpower, but I am just a person." He also said:</p>
<p>"I'm dizzy and discouraged today. I worked for four hours and couldn't produce a single sentence. I didn't write a line all day today, although I crossed out a hundred lines. This kind of work is really difficult. Art! Art! What kind of demon are you, to chew on our blood and sweat? For what?"</p>
<p>Every time Ouyang Xiu wrote an article, he would paste it on the wall and revise it again and again. When it was finalized, there was often not a single word left from the original text. Zhu Hui'an once saw the original manuscript of his "Drunken Pavilion Record." The beginning was three or four lines, and all were crossed out and replaced with the five words "Around Chu are all mountains."</p>
<p>Wang Jinggong's quatrain "Spring breeze turns the south bank green again" originally had "green" as "to," circled it, and noted "not good," changed it to "pass," circled it again, changed it to "enter," and then changed it to "full." After about ten such changes, it was finally decided as "green." (From Hong Jinglu's "Rong Zhai Continued Notes")</p>
<p>From this, it can be seen that the completion of genius requires human effort. It is especially easy to see in the tempering of works. The works published by writers and artists are all the final revised versions. In these mature works, we often only see the harvest, but not the difficult and arduous cultivation that the harvest has gone through. If we can pay attention to the author's writing stories, it is not difficult to find the importance of "tempering" in the process of completing the work.</p>
<h3>Lines Near Clouds</h3>
<p>— Bai Jiao</p>
<p>Writing orchids for Jing'an Clinic, for Abbot Ben Guang</p>
<p>Putting down the pen, I always see a pure heart, searching for Xie Ting for thousands of years. Wanting to return to the mountain to break the black basin, re-muttering straight until today.</p>
<p>The thick ink seems cluttered but the faint ink is real, the brushwork is a new and unique rendering. The mountain range emits fragrance deep within the clouds, who comes to quietly admire this lonely shore?</p>
<p>Also seeing Yang Zhi in a clean vase, looking at the Buddha's disciple with anxious expression. Coming out of the mountain to write a thousand orchids, people return to the Xiao Temple with stars at night.</p>
<h3>A Washbasin</h3>
<p>— Yanfan</p>
<p>Like the storm surge last week, I was really worried that after I sent out my manuscript and received the manuscript fee, I wouldn't be able to buy back a piece of manuscript paper and an envelope. It was so terrible, so crazy, really like the collapse of the earth and the tsunami, making people feel cold!</p>
<p>Last Friday, the maid at home wanted to buy a washbasin. She took 400,000 yuan to the department store to take a look. The price of the washbasin was 950,000 yuan each. She asked to pay 400,000 yuan first and wait until she got home to take the remaining 550,000 to pick up the goods, but the store refused. So she hurried back to get 1 million yuan, but the department store was closed when she got there. It was 3:30 pm at that time. The next morning, the price of the washbasin was 1.2 million yuan. The maid's money was not enough again. She came back to get twice as much money and finally bought it back for 1.45 million yuan. In the afternoon, she went to other places to take a look. The same size and quality of washbasin cost 1.6 million or 1.7 million. Finally, when she went back to the place where she bought it, the value of the washbasin had increased to 1.8 million yuan. This is real. The price doubled in a day and a half. This terrible record is unprecedented. One, two, three, four times, people generally feel a kind of low air pressure, like a dense cloud that won't rain, pressing tightly on the chest.</p>
<p>I heard that the price of soap last month increased four times, and the price of cigarettes also increased two or three times. Which daily necessities only increased by one time? When prices had just stopped for a few days, the price of bus and tram tickets doubled (200%), and ships were about to increase again, and public utilities were about to increase again. The storm surge, like the collapse of the earth and the tsunami, seems to be brewing again. Is there no end to these terrible days?</p>
<p>###</p>
<p>The new mayor of Beiping has been announced but has not yet taken office, so the city council still needs Mayor He to take the brunt of the questions and answers. Then there was Councilor Liu, who spoke first, hoping that he "become a perfect person." This is also a moralistic term, but it is one step further than Mr. Fan of Shanghai's "be a person." The ancients often said, "There is no perfect person after the Three Dynasties," which shows how difficult and precious a "perfect person" is. Even above the Three Dynasties, there may not be a truly perfect person. A "perfect person" is more difficult than a sage or hero. There must be no misconduct and no dissenting opinions. Therefore, even with Confucius's sagehood, the "Nanzi" aspect made his disciples unhappy and became the ammunition for modern "Down with the Confucian Shop" advocates. Even with Guan Gong's cultivation, the Jingzhou affair still led to failure due to his strictness, leaving a stain in history. Even heroes with great achievements are difficult to guarantee against all mistakes. One mistake means that they cannot be a "perfect person." Therefore, Buddhism emphasizes asceticism through countless tribulations, unstained by any dust, to cultivate a perfect golden body! Councilor Liu used this to expect Mayor He, which can be said to be particularly caring, but if the words stop here, it is still a personal relationship, a practice problem, and has little to do with the duties of the council. Therefore, Mr. Liu continued to question "the two iron beds at the Beijing Hotel?" This is related to the mayor's "perfect person" and also conforms to the original intention of the councilor's speech.</p>
<p>Therefore, Mayor He also solemnly explained that his wife had borrowed two beds from Tianjin when she returned to Ping and placed them in the dormitory. They would be moved back soon. He also said, "If I wanted to be corrupt, I would never be greedy for a few chairs, tables, or a few beds." This answer is quite reasonable. Mrs. He is a European woman, and the Beijing Hotel is purely European-style. It is common to borrow and use them because they are accustomed to and similar. No problem arises for the “perfect person.” In addition, there was Councilor Wang's question about the trees in Wansheng Garden, and Councilor Fei's question about the property rights of the Beijing Hotel, which Mr. He answered one by one. Those listening in the audience could not easily criticize, and "perfect people" are not easy to obtain and cannot be asked for perfection.</p>
<p>Mr. He is about to leave office, so although he was present, his words and deeds were full of emotions of departure. Although the councilors questioned him, their wording was relatively tactful. Finally, they jointly resolved to praise the mayor's efforts and dedication during his tenure and telegraphed the central government to assign him a new position to express their thoughts of departure. Then, at this meeting, Mr. He had gained great sympathy and comfort. The ancients said, "Those whose souls are dimmed and dissipated are separated." Once a person arrives on stage and it's time to leave, the masses will often forgive them. Humans are emotional. Isn't that true?</p>
