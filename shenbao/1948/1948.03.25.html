<h3>國防部發言人闡釋華中綏區新措施　針對匪三求戰術縮短勘亂時間</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿四日電〕國軍爲擊破匪之三求戰術，及其五月渡江計劃，已由上週華中綏靖會議決定新措施，包括實行華中總體戰，解決土地問題，及優待軍人授田戰士等辦法。俾國軍速獲勝利，縮短戡亂時間，减少人民恐慌與痛苦。此項新措施即將逐步實行。國防部發言人廿四日在記者招待會宣佈此事時，曾解釋稱：</p>
<p>總體戰術</p>
<p>劉匪伯承，陳匪毅之「三求政策」，爲就地補充兵員，就地補充糧食，在戰塲前綫補充械彈。國軍實施總體戰，目的在使綏區軍事政治經濟打成一片，提高綏區司令官權責，擴充地方武力，民衆保家自衛，切斷匪之兵員糧食補給；國軍以進剿追剿與地方堵剿淸剿配合，則華中戰塲局勢必能迅速改觀，劉匪難於立足，勢將被迫竄回黄河以北。</p>
<p>土地問題</p>
<p>解決土地問題，目的在要求耕者有其田，政府以規定土地所有權最高額及發行土地債券辦法，使耕農獲有土地，同時减輕田賦及實行三一减租，糧食攤派改爲由參議會公平議繳，不許軍政機關部隊直接經手，以免流弊。</p>
<p>戰士授田</p>
<p>優待軍人戰士授田，目的在獎勵人民從軍，現役軍人每人可得三畝至五畝土地，以鼓舞士氣，同時全國人民均安慰戰士，優待戰士家屬，士氣旺盛，戰事當易於獲勝。</p>

<h3>中國學術研究的前程　—中央研究院第二屆評議會開幕獻辭—</h3>
<p>國立中央研究院今日在南京舉行第二届評議會，主要任務爲正式選舉「院士」，並當討論其他有關學術硏究的根本問題。際此國家多難之際，集全國著名學者於首都，以從事於國家硏究體制的建立，和推進學術硏究的商討，特別値得全國人士的珍視。雖然敎育學術界現在普遍患窮，學術研究備受阻力，但立國的大計，和學者謀國之道，着眼自應遠大。我們於此，謹歡迎代表我國學術權威之第一次院士的誕生，並預祝該會的成功。</p>
<p>中央研究院可說是我國的國家學院，其理想的地位，應與英國的皇家學會和法國的科學院相同。但是成立廿年以來，因爲我國科學研究的條件尙欠健全，繼之又受抗戰的波折，所以久未完成其基本組成分子的體制，因此也還不能達到和歐美所謂國家學院相當的境界。院士之設，即所以確立其基礎，而完成我國家學術上的組織。此事醞釀頗早，至卅五年十月的評議會年會，始通過原則；去年三月，該院組織法修正公布，此後即進行籌備選舉工作。先經各大學·學院·學會·硏究機構提名，擬定初步名單四〇二人，再在去年十月第四次評議會分組審査，復經大會通過「院士候選人」一五〇人（數理組四九人，生物組四六人，人文組五五人）。此次大會，則是在候選人姓名公告後四個月，即將在此一五〇人中選出一百人爲院士（原定自八十至一百人），且規定須有五分四之同意票方得當選。其鄭重可見一斑。</p>
<p>「院士」我國學術上係一種新名稱，不可說是一新制度。依據組織法，院士以「對於所專習之學術有特殊著作，發明或貢獻者」，成「對所專習學術之機關領導主持五年以上卓著成績者」二種資格為標準。就是直接成間接有特殊貢獻於專門學術者方可當選。除出將來院士的添舉，與評議員的選舉外，其主要的職權，便是「議訂國家學術之方針。」我們期望中國院士的地位，成爲中國學術界最高光榮的象徵，受國家社會的尊重，爲從事學術研究者理想的鵠的。在學風凋敝的今日，樹立起這樣超現實的衡人標準，一定足爲獎進學術研究風氣的一種精神力量。</p>
<p>我國古來一向尊崇學術，學者高士往往敝屣名位，而爲朝野所尊慕。可惜科舉的極弊，和政治的影響，漸漸摧殘了中國純理科學的發展，甚且毁壞了一般尊師崇學的宗風。淸末以來的興學，五四以後的提倡科學，又僅得他人的皮相，幾有得檀還珠之誚。八年的抗戰是一次殘酷的考驗；更由空前劇烈的國際戰爭，使我們領會一種血的敎訓，就是現代的戰爭是高度的科學的戰爭；而國防科學的高深運用，必須有無數專門學者經長時期「無所爲而爲」的專門研究爲其基礎。推廣言之，近代國家的力量，必基於高度的學術領導，作有組織的運用，而又決非守狹隘的急功近利主義和少數人短期的努力所能成。此在現代國家建設的事業，莫不如此。爲了和平建國，爲了能自衛以保障和平，今後的中國對於專門學術研究的努力，眞應該急起直追，迎頭趕上去。</p>
<p>此次硏究院院士的產生，在這一個意義上，一定足以創導一種新風氣，而對專門硏究作有力的鼓勵。不過這祗是一個良好的開端，而有待更多因素來展開其前程。我們以爲要　進中國學術的研究，必須政府·社會各方面，與學術界本身，共同作一番痛澈的檢省，和多方面實際的努力。</p>
<p>第一是政府的切實獎勵。抗戰期間，政府維特各級敎育，煞費苦心，但我們深覺政府對於維持高等敎育，似太偏於量的擴充，而對質的方面不够重視。專科以上學校單位大見增加了，而第一流大學的圖書儀器不見有多大充實。若干大學添設研究所，好似已向國家學術獨立的方向走了，可是一部分　然是名不副實。簡單的說，十年來我們國家財政所擔負的學校經常經費大，而用之於獎勵高深學術研究的實在太微薄了。今後國家敎育文化費預算，不但對中央硏究院各單位與一切硏究機構的經費，應增列較大的教字；對於硏究工作人員的待遇特予提高，使能久於其事；而且對於有歷史有成績的科學團體機關，要一視同仁的予以獎助。中央硏究院諸君本着嚶鳴求友同志合作的立塲，自然也樂贊其成的。</p>
<p>說到待遇，我們以爲再不能說什麼「君子憂道不憂貧」一類抽象的話，丙爲當前經濟變化眞是太現實太嚴重了。胡適之先生南下開會到滬時答本報記者問話，開頭就說北大敎授「窮得要死」，學者專家誠然要自甘於「淡泊」，但國家亦　使他們能安於「寂寞」，才能由專業與恒久而有累積的成就。我們盼望政府除出對於敎授和敎育界服務人負應統籌有效的補救外，對於研究機構中各級硏究員必須予以不下於敎授　敎授的生活待遇，例如基薪的提高，福利的籌劃，實物的配給，必須與大學敎授同樣顧到。埋首實驗室與圖書室中孜孜研究，爲國家爭學術地位平等的人，是最應受國家之優待的。（下轉第五版）</p>

<h3>國防部發表一週戰局</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿四日電〕國防部政工局廿四日發表三月十七日至廿三日之一週戰局，全文如次：</p>
<p>這一星期中東北戰塲的匪軍自竄陷四平受了重大的傷亡以後，雖其主力現分竄長南，伊通，雙陽一帶，作一個威脅長春的姿態，實則深痛鉅創之餘，正在加緊補充，一方面因國軍主動撤離永吉，出匪意外，現已將長春的防務加强，匪雖有蠢動的念頭，但一時仍苦力不從心，所以整個遼北現較平靜，至於遼南方面，國軍自十五日克復遼中，縱續向西南挺進，進展神速，錦州至瀋陽的公路，不久當可通行。</p>
<p>華北戰塲的聶榮臻匪部，自從在保定外圍　動失敗後，無法再在此方活動，乃親率其一，二，三，四，六，共五個縱隊和大批民伕担架，向晉冀察邊區竄犯，企圖破壞平綏鐵路，孤立大同，該匪速日進犯蔚縣，使用了兩個縱隊的兵力，想用以大吃小方法攻下蔚縣，但蔚縣仍屹立無恙，同時又用了很大的兵力，進犯桃花堡（涿鹿南），也被國軍所擊退，現該方面國軍正配合民衆武力，準備給該匪以迎頭痛剿。</p>
<p>魯中方面，陳毅匪部之第七，九，十三，新八，四個縱隊及四個警衛團，共約四萬餘匪衆，妄想沿膠濟綫四進，佯爲威脅濟南，實則企岡回竄沂蒙山區老巢，目前我由濟南東進之强大兵幽，業已進迫周村，王村之綫，該方面戰事，不久將有新的發展。</p>
<p>此外在蘇北的陳毅匪部十一，十二兩縱隊，從東臺一敗後，十一縱隊已被國軍迫到海邊去了，其十二縱隊殘部被迫北竄，企岡與漣水附近第二縱隊合股，刻正被國軍截擊於益林附近地區，該方面近日無大戰鬥。</p>
<p>大別山方面，劉匪之三，六兩縱隊仍徬徨山區，這一星期中無大變化，其第二縱隊一部，至息縣以東之方集地區，廿一日被國軍整整解決了他一個團，其中大部被俘，其第二縱隊主力與第一縱隊在新蔡以北及臨泉附近地區，企圖接運陳毅第十，十一兩縱隊所送來的新兵和糧彈，但至目前爲止，連陳毅匪部的兩個縱隊，都一併被我三面强大國軍隔斷至太和西南及嗨泉附近地區。</p>
<p>晉陜方面，匪以五倍於國軍的兵力，圍攻晉南的臨汾與陜北的洛川，迄已逾半月，該匪傷亡重大，頓兵城下，該兩城仍在國軍手中。陜北彭匪在緊攻洛川不下之時，派了二，四兩縱隊，還企岡分派小股，到處鑽隙向國軍後方擾亂，但終因國軍和人民的密切合作，匪的夢想仍被粉碎。</p>
<p>總結一週間的戰局，匪已實行三分軍事，七分宣傳的策略，在東北如此，在華　　　也是如此，我們相信國軍必定會以行動來答復匪的宣傳，中華民族的正義，終必獲得　　　勝利。</p>

<h3>陳納德在美國發表演說　主切實助我作戰　蘇予中共軍火足供百萬軍隊之用</h3>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓廿三日電〕陳納德。將認爲中國之內戰實爲第三次大戰之開始。渠力促美國應有二萬名之軍事顧問團，協助中國政府軍之各連各隊，直接參加作戰。渠力言，除非有美國立即之軍事，財政與經濟之協助，以及戰地上之技術顧問，共產黨將在三個月之內，攫取整個東北。</p>
<p>渠在華僑作家俱樂部宴會時，力言東北之陷落不久將使其餘中國赤化，可能越南，馬來亞，荷印，暹羅，緬甸與印度　，均受赤化·如蘇聯感覺其東翼十分安全時，渠即能在三個月之中，直趨英吉利海峽，在此情形下，美國僅以經濟協助歐洲，實愚不可及也；然自由獨立之中國存在時，蘇聯即不能認爲東翼可十分安全也。</p>
<p>陳納德又稱，美國必須予中國以足够之軍事協助，以抵消蘇聯之予中共者。渠估計蘇聯付予共軍之日本武器，足供給一百萬軍人作戰十年。美國必須使中國國軍有足够之軍力，維持西北之蘭州與西安，蓋彼處仍有可用之空軍基地，必要時美國可用之轟炸蘇聯之工業中心也。國軍如能堅守該地或即可避免蘇聯在歐洲採取直接之軍事行勸矣。渠總稱，美國欲保障其在歐洲之經濟投資，首須加强對蘇聯之東翼，在中國之基地，美國可予利用時，蘇聯決不致在西方進攻，反之如共黨控制全中國，蘇聯即將後顧無憂，而直　海峽矣。</p>
<p>陳納德稱，美顧問雖不應直接指揮中國國軍作戰，然各最低級單位之中國軍隊中，必須有美國顧問。渠指出，美國對國軍之裝備均輸入共軍之手之言，爲　妄者。渠又迫憶渠指揮「飛虎隊」以及美十四航空隊在中國作戰之事稱，在一九四〇至一九四一年之時期中，渠發現美軍部幾完全不過問遠東戰塲。美陸軍與空軍根本無一强準確之亞洲地岡，彼時在華盛頓之官方中，惟一認識遠東之重要性者，爲海軍部長諾克斯與財長摩根韜耳。渠稱，彼時陸軍部長史汀生與空軍部官員，均反對渠爲飛虎隊招募駕駛員，後經故羅斯福總統之說項，渠才得　集二百五十名駕駛員與機械師，發動P-40型飛機一百架，終於擊毁日機二百九十九架。目前中國共軍之跋扈，實由馬歇爾籌成大錯。馬歇爾調解國共糾紛之企圖，遂使共軍有在東北加强其地位之機會。陳納德並未述及美國應予中國援助之數額，然前此　在議會陳述意見時，首謂兩年內如能有十五億至二十億之數，即能應付一切對華軍事·經濟與財政之援助矣。</p>

<h3>德境佔領區行政　仍歸美陸軍統治　克萊將軍無限期留任現職　蘇聯抵制柏林盟管會三強採取反措施</h3>
<p>〔路透社華盛頓廿三日電〕白宮今日宣布，業已放棄由國務部於今夏接管德境美國區行政之計劃，美國區政府將繼續無定期由美陸軍負責。白宗教之文吿有云，「査本年一月廿七日陸軍部宣布業已成立協定，由國務部接管佔領德國非軍事部份之責任，預定接管日期約在一九四八年七月一日左右。惟自實新檢討最近之局勢後，決定殊不宜對美國在德之現有行政制度有所變動。此項新決議對於發展德人自治責任之進展，不致有任何相反的影響。克萊將軍將繼續爲駐歐美軍總司令　德境美軍政府首長」。</p>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓廿三日電〕白宮今日宣布：杜魯門總統已放棄德境美國佔領區移交文官統治計劃，此係總統會同外交及軍事顧問商定，作爲防共另一措施。據一部份官員稱，德國爲東西簡衝突之樞紐，主管機構若有變更，不免削弱美國在歐洲之地位。克萊魯於數月前表示擬於年內辭職，但鑒於今日之宣布，可見其或將無限期留任。</p>
<p>〔聯合社柏林廿四日電〕美軍政府總督克萊宜稱，軍政人員　擬逐漸改為文職，茲已決定從緩實行。至於歐洲方面美國駐軍，德奧及特里埃斯三處總共十萬人，為數甚小，但其不退之象徵，在心理上頗有價值。據美國外交官私下稱，此對西歐之保障，在許多方面尤勝於正式同盟條約。</p>

<p>〔路透社柏林廿三日電〕德境英軍政府長官羅勃森中將今日宣布，在四強盟管會復會以前，英方將拒不參加盟管會之一切地附屬機構。羅勃森雖否認其先所傳英美法三軍政府長官已照會蘇方，要求立即釋明蘇聯退出盟管會意義之說，然英國之抵制盟管會附屬機構，即不帝強迫蘇方公開釋明其最近之行動及意向。按盟管會所屬四強指導部迅柏林四強政府在內，共計十四單位，依輪値制度，現均由蘇輪値主席。蘇當局雖已宣布盟管會業已不復行使職權，及宣布僅次於盟管會之四强聯絡委會無定期延會，但仍於今日發同十三個指導部所屬若干小組於明日開會之通知。</p>
<p>〔路透社柏林廿三日電〕美國與法國亦已繼英國之後聲明在盟管會復會以前，拒絕參加盟管會之附屬機構。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕紐約廿四日廣播：華盛頓訊，據悉，美軍界領袖將於明日出席國會，要求將國防預算增至二百十億美元。技杜魯門總統於本年一月間向國會所提一九四九年財政年度之國防預算爲一百十億美元。國防預算所擬增加之數額，大部份將用於空軍方面，對於飛機之增產，大爲注目。</p>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓廿三日電〕杜魯門總統今日與全國最高級軍事領袖舉行秘密會議，出席者有陸海空軍部各位參謀總長，國防部長福萊斯特海軍上將李希，與預算等局長惠勃等。據國防部方面稱，會議中曾討論以數百億元重建陸海軍，以及擁有飛機二萬餘架之空軍計劃。出席會議者均拒絕透露消息，僅惠勃稱，「總統之立塲堅定，渠之決定必於國家有益者」。然所謂決定究何所指，則未予透露。</p>
<p>據國防部消息稱，杜魯門曾所以使全國之軍力，足以支持政府反對蘇聯繼續擴張之立塲應需經　若干。據稱，各部參謀長携有若干計劃，其經費各各不同，自一百億而至於十億。</p>
<p>參院兵役委會現已在討論普遍軍訓案，福萊斯特定於廿五日向　會提出該建議之詳細計劃。在杜魯門提出軍訓與徵兵呼籲後，此間即傳渠將要求議會增撥軍費，按前此渠所要求一九四九年度之軍費預算爲一百十億元。記者　及總統將於何時向議會提出新預算案，惠勃答稱未知。白宮新聞秘書羅斯稱，總統吿渠稱，「會議中僅涉及軍事之預算問題而未及其他。」</p>
<p>國防部消息稱，會議中曾建議將目前一百卅九萬二千名現役軍人增至一百九十六萬三千人，此將使陸軍自目前之五十五萬人增至九十萬，海軍目前之四十八萬三千人增至六十六萬二千，空軍則自目前三十五萬九千人之五十五隊增至四十萬一千人之七十隊。擁有飛機二萬另五百四十一架之空軍計劃，將包括第一綫飛機六千八百六十九架，（包括轟炸機，戰鬥機與運輸機等），國防空軍廿七隊共三千二百廿二架，後備單卅四隊共二千三百六十架，以及遞補損失之後備飛機八千一百架。</p>
<p>〔美國新聞處華盛頓廿三日電〕參院軍役委會今日聽取前副國務卿及駐日大使格魯之證詞，渠贊成杜魯門總統所提有限制徵兵及普遍軍訓案。</p>
<p>格魯稱，目下，採取普遍軍訓與徵兵，不但對具有侵略意向國家如蘇聯等國可以作爲一種警吿，並足以鼓勵具有和平意向國家如希，芬，土，義等國之抵抗。</p>
<h3>三強外長會議有召開可能</h3>

<h3>援歐援華統一法案　美衆院可望通過　參院核準援助希土法案</h3>
<p>〔中央社華盛頓二十三日電〕衆院今對六十二億零五百萬美元之「統一」援外法案，開始作預定十五小時之辯論，主張此項措施最力之衆院諸領袖咸教促通過法案，作爲制止共產主義蔓延之工具，衆院外委會主席伊登主持對此項予中國經濟援助四億二千萬美元及軍事援助一億五千萬美元之法案之辯論時，指責蘇聯共產主義「在可能時藉背信負義之滲入，在必要時使用武力」，以圖征服全世界，伊氏又稱：問題在於在美國領導之下之自由抑或在蘇聯卵翼下之奴役，援外法案即爲美國所宣佈之選擇途徑。</p>
<p>〔美國新聞處華盛頓廿三日電」六十二億〇五百萬美元對外援助統一法案，預料衆院將於一一一月卅一日對該法案採取行動，其後，衆參兩院將舉行聯席會議，俾就兩院所通過之對外援助立法不一致谷點，覓致解決辦法。預料國會之最後行動，將在四月十日左右。衆議員周以德（明尼蘇達州共和黨議員）曾發言演說，警吿衆院謂：使亞洲同樣保持自由，亦屬必要，「不然吾人在歐洲亦必失敗。」周氏稱援助計劇爲一種「健全之投資」，並謂其目的乃在帮助民主國家保持堅强自由，「以待世界自鎖鏈中解脫出來」。渠認爲亞洲十億人民之未來趨向，「爲二十世紀最深刻之問題」。周氏演說結束後，聽衆曾報以歡呼，幾達一分鐘之久。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕倫敦廿四日廣播：日內瓦訊，今日聯合國新聞自由會議指導委員會在羅慕洛領導下開會，蘇代表鮑哥莫洛夫企圖阻擾討論國際新聞自由憲章，未獲成功。鮑氏認為在議權上有三項議題「有損國家之主權」，主張不予討論，但結果為九票對兩票否決（蘇聯與南斯拉夫投反對票）故仍將其保持於議程中。蘇聯所反對討論之三點，有如下述：（一）考慮起草有關新聞傳遞之憲章，規定其權利與義務；（二）考慮設置一常設國際機構，蓬以促進國際間準確情報之自由交換，並規定簽發記者證之辦法；（三）考慮設置各國政府之新聞機關，使其消息可爲國外所獲悉，並在需要時可成立協定，俾給予此種工作以種種便利。</p>
<p>指導委員會曾就蘇方建議討論兩小時之久，結果反對此項建議者認爲蘇聯之建議茍被接受，則會議之目的將全失，美代表朋頓認爲設置常設機關之議題必不能予以取消，並堅主將蘇聯所反對之三點全部包括於議程中。</p>

<h3>東南亞各地共產黨活動</h3>
<p>〔中央社紐約廿三日電〕據「紐約時報」新德里訊，亞洲共黨之活動，係經由莫斯科駐亞洲數大城市之特務人員與莫斯科聯繫。各大城市中以曼谷及香港兩地最爲重要。密切注視知名共黨領袖活動之有關國家，其偵察人員已發現亞洲方面共黨侵入行爲之方法。根據調査無綫電訊及若干旅客之活動結果，共黨似已於亞洲各國樹立强國之陣綫。據聞亞洲共黨之工作路綫，莫斯科東方政治部領導者爲曾任華北共黨領袖之王明，聞哈爾濱及海參崴並設有較爲內層之機構。中國方面之總部以前設延安，目前未與共軍總部設於一處。據消息靈通方面稱，共黨之特務人員及煽動份子（大部均爲華人）係經由航行海參崴上海香港間之蘇船送至香港，而後潛入東南亞各地。其他經常在香港更換船員之船隻，亦可爲載運共黨侵入份子者。新德里方面消息靈通人士認爲莫斯科企圖假借工會聯盟。世界民主靑年。及學生組織聯盟等國際團體，影響亞洲之羣衆。戰爭結束以來，亞洲各國之共黨代表會於大連·曼谷·香港及海參崴數度舉行會議，去歲九月於曼谷舉行之會議，設立東南亞同盟，並以東南亞人民獨立，促進世界和平，促進東南亞聯盟爲號召。其行動係訴訟民族主義，而此種民族主義又頗似仿傚戰前日本所使用之「亞洲人之亞洲」等宣傳之種族主義。</p>

<p>〔美國新聞處華盛頓廿三日電〕衆院撥款委會對國務院預算案前曾删减近一千六百萬美元，國務卿馬歇爾本日請求參院撥款小組會予以恢復。渠宣稱，一九四九年財政年在世界事務中，將無疑的爲「緊急」之一年。馬歇爾吿參院小組會稱，向衆院所提出之預算估計，並不包括若干項基金請求，此項基金可予以删除而「實際上不致妨礙外交關係之進行」。渠指出國務院所關切之世界情形，在最近數星期來，非但不見改　，反而愈趨惠化。渠稱，「德日及朝鮮等國之問題仍未解決，此等問題愈多，則對聯合國之注意與支持，需要愈增。』</p>

<p>〔路透社倫敦廿三日電〕下議院辯論巴勒斯坦問題時，貝交外相強調聲明美國雖已撤回其對巴勒斯坦分治計劃之支持，但英政府並未改變其政策，亦不能改變其政策。殖民部、大巨瓊斯在同一辯論中宣布，英國決如期於五月十五日交出巴勒斯坦之委治，於八月一日撤畢駐軍。貝文稱，英政府雖已聲明將盡力覓取猶阿兩族問之解決，但英國決不參加任何決議案之執行。在繼續談判期間英國將保持中立地位。</p>

<h3>四強草特港新地位協定　義準備參加談判　特港邊境一帶局勢緊張</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕倫敦廿四日廣播：米蘭訊，特港局勢　為緊張。由於共產黨在未獲核准之下擬舉行示威之故，英美當局已令警察七千人隨時防範。此外由於英美法有關特港交還義國之建議發表後，南國軍隊已向前推進數百碼之故，英美方面已增强駐軍實力。</p>
<p>〔美國新聞處華盛頓廿三日電〕義大利已照會美國，準備參加草擬一項建議，將特港交還義大利，一如美英法聯合聲明所提議者，以備提交聯合國安理會考慮。國務院本日宣佈收到義照會，同時亦收到南斯拉夫反對特港交還義大利之備忘錄。按特港交還義國一項建議之原本，係提交義大利與蘇聯，而副本則提交此間南斯拉夫代表，同時並由美代表奧斯汀提交安理會。雖無正式文吿，但據悉美官員認爲南斯拉夫對於決定特港之前途一事，並無發言權，此事僅爲四大國之問題。彼等指出，自由領土之產生，乃由於四大國批准條約一舉，經各該國與義大利之同意，即可加以變更。</p>
<h3>南否認向義大利索戈里齊亞　義北部共黨活動</h3>
<p>〔聯合社羅馬廿四日電〕南斯拉夫外交部昨夜聲明，並不堅持特里埃斯特交還義大利時，須以其北面之戈里立齊亞劃歸南斯拉夫作爲交換條件。外國方面因此所發生之誤會，殊屬可惜，義大利聞之表示滿意。南外部發言人並暗示，將考慮其他交換辦法。同時米蘭方面，共黨昨夜又與親政府派發生衝突，警察施放催淚彈加以驅散雙方衝突今已第三日。畢特芒廣塲今日舉行民衆大會，竟有人高呼「戰爭萬歲」之口號，數人受傷。夭主敎廣塲亦有數萬人示威，附近警察局頓成戰時景象，各交通要道均架鐵絲網障碍物。</p>

<h3>美對日工業擬取寬大政策</h3>
<p>屈拉普會晤蘆出均</p>
<p>〔合衆社東京二十四日電〕接近屈拉普調査團人士二十四日吿合衆社稱：美國處理日本工業之最後政策恐將併合「史揣克報吿及東京盟方官員之最寬大主張。」彼等稱：麥帥對工業之意見如果寬宏大量，可能被採納。如麥帥建議不及史揣克報吿之寬大，後者恐將被遵行。然日本人必須先表示願意自　，且有改革之具體證據，美國始可予以協助。擬在日本投資之美人對日本目前之經濟局面表示不滿，對日本現行稅則有裹足不前之勢，且以爲日本尙未以完全鼓勵外人投資。</p>
<p>〔合衆社東京二十四日電〕消息靈通人士語合衆社稱，日本首相蘆田均二十四日向特調査團保證，美國計劃建設日本成爲遠東反共之堡壘，日本將「竭盡全力」合作。消息靈通人士又稱，蘆田徇美陸次屈拉普之邀，會談一小時又十分鐘。屈氏會向蘆田提出若干直接要求，如要求蘆田集中力量儘遠恢復日本之經濟。傳屈氏特別要求增加煤斤之生產。合衆社悉，日政府將要求屈拉普團建議准許日本借用美國之剩餘船隻。據悉，屈氏二十五日將與日本經濟平衡局長來栖武夫會談。</p>
<h3>遠東委會發表對日決策　澈底解除日武裝　規定辦法訓令麥帥執行</h3>
<p>〔美國新聞處華盛頓廿三日電〕遠東委員會本日發表二月十二日所究成之政策決議，旨在防止將來日本駐武主義之復活。委員會稱：以此項政策爲基礎之指令一件，已送達東京盟國最高統帥。此一政策決議僅有關禁止日本之軍事活動及日本軍事設備之處置問題，爲對日本投降以後基本政策之產物，此項基本政策於去年六月十九日經遠東委員會所通過。</p>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓廿三日電〕十一國遠東委員會今日宣布第四十七號決策，規定：（一）日本須解除一切武裝，僅得保留步槍，手槍，獵槍及警察所用其他小型兵器；（二）日本在盟國管制期內並不得自造各種飛機；（三）日本並不得建造各種軍艦或輔助艦，並不得將其他船隻改造作軍用；（四）日軍復員名册應全部銷燬；（五）任何軍事組織如前軍官聯誼會之類一律不得恢復，並應禁止各種軍事敎練；（六）日本各級軍官凡曾參加第二次世界大戰者槪一律不准使用，惟曾反對日本侵略者得由麥帥指定作爲例外；（七）第二次世界大戰中所被沒收之各種軍事配備槪須銷燬，指定給佔領軍及日本警察應用者或指定作賠償用者不在此例。此項決策已訓令麥帥執行，與麥帥歷來根據美國陸軍部暫時訓令所已執行者，均須待簽訂和約恢復其戰前主權時另行規定。蘇聯代表潘友新於委員會秘密會議中反對准許日本警察得以使用其他小型兵器，認爲此種規定可有種種不同之解釋，引起流弊。</p>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓廿三日電〕遠東委員會之蘇聯代表潘友新堅主此種記錄之銷燬最好能規定時限，並要求插入一項「必須於一一一個月至六個月內銷毁究畢」之條款。遠東委員會結果並未核准此一條款，但蘇聯代表亦未使用否決權。蘇代表又主張日本所有軍事配備應在六個月內銷毁，但亦未爲遠東委員會所接受。</p>
<p>國際法院開庭情形　（一）院長勾雷樓（二）英籍法官摩奈爾（三）我國法官徐謨（四）阿臨時法官</p>
<h3>柯孚海峽案觀審記</h3>
<p>— （本報駐歐特派記者中西）</p>
<p>國際法院之產生</p>
<p>第二次世界大戰結束，聯合國機構宣吿產生。根據聯合國憲章第九十二條之規定，國際法院爲聯合國主要或最高的司法機構，其組織與根據一九二二年國際聯盟規約第十四條而設立的國際常設法庭無大區別，並仍以海牙爲國際法院之院址。</p>
<p>回顧大戰結束迄今將近三年，國際間糾紛和爭案層出不窮，可是成立了兩年多的國際法院，老是冷淸淸的。十五位負有世界聲譽的法官，僅有兼院長勾雷樓，薩爾瓦多籍的法官，與中國籍的徐謨法官，以及一位挪威籍和一位波蘭籍的法官等四人，常川駐在海牙，其餘的十一位，大多閒住在各人本國，做着各人自己的工作。表面看來，國際法院沒有案子，正表示天下太平，可是我們仔細留意國際政治上的事件，就可以感覺，戰後仍有許多國家，祗知講政治手　，不肯依法律解決。因此有不少事件，原該可以交國際法院和平解決的，如今却多想避越國際法院，便宜行事，於是國際法院幾乎形同虛設了。</p>
<p>英阿爭案之起因</p>
<p>一九四六年十月二十二日，英國驅逐艦隊於通過阿爾巴尼亞之柯孚海峽時，其中兩艘一爲「伏萊奇」號，另一爲「蘇瑪雷」號，先後爲水雷所炸傷，共死英水手四十四人，傷廿二人（同年五個月前英巡洋艦於通過上述海峽時，曾爲阿爾巴尼亞海岸砲隊所轟擊），事後英政府査得海峽中其他未炸水雷十二枚，發覺均係新佈，認爲此舉與阿爾巴尼亞政府不無關係。乃於一九四七年一月間提請安全理事會處理。英國要求安全理事會斥責罪在阿方，惟爲蘇聯所否決。同年四月九日安全理事會決議，「關於一九四六年十月廿二日英艦兩艘於通過柯孚海峽遭遇水雷炸擊，致使若干英國水手受死傷，因此引起英國與阿爾巴尼亞發生爭議。安理會對雙方所提意見予以考慮後，茲建議當事雙方應將此爭議交由國際法院依法處理。」</p>
<p>嗣英政府於五月廿二日向國際法院申請對阿爾巴尼亞提出訴訟，認爲柯孚海峽，應准各國船隻自由通過，今海峽中發現水雷阿政府自應負其責任。阿爾巴尼亞政府對佈雷一節，聲稱不知其事，同時向國際法院提出抗告書，認爲阿政府雖接受安理會建議，但英國政府未經與阿政府商洽，單方逕自向國際法院申請控訴，手續上實屬錯誤，國際法院應對之不予受理。</p>
<p>國際法院於接到英政府由請及阿政府抗吿後，定於本年二月廿六日開庭審訊，以決定國際法院對於本案究竟是否有權管轄，可否受理。</p>
<p>和平宮頓形熱鬧</p>
<p>國際法院開庭的時間，由院長決定爲二月廿六日下午四時，因爲是戰後第一次審訊案件，冷淸了將近十載的海牙和平宮，頓形熱鬧。一輛輛的汽車，載着法官·外交官·當事雙方政府的代表和律師。各國的新聞記者與參加旁聽和看熟鬧的仕女，紛紛來到。</p>
<p>國際法院審案的法庭，在和平宮的右角，時間不過三點半鐘，來賓席的座位已擠得滿滿的。六隻很大的水晶燈高懸在廳上，外加攝影用的大電燈，把全庭照耀得明亮如同白晝。法官坐西朝東，右前方爲速記席，左前方爲繙譯席，旁爲記者席。正中爲原被吿發言台，合之右爲英國政府之代表與律師，台之左爲阿方之代表與律師，旁聽席面對法官。時將四點，英代表及律師共八人首先入庭，頭戴灰白假髪，身穿黑長法袍，頗引起觀衆之注目。阿代表及律師共祗三人，衣條子褲，黑上身，爲歐洲人日間所常着之便禮服，倒也十分整潔。</p>
<p>四時正，庭丁朗呼「開庭！開庭」！十六位法官由書記官長帶路！魚貫入庭，全塲人仕均起立致敬。最後一位是阿爾巴尼亞向捷克請來的臨時法官，照國際法院院章規定，如法官中無當事國之國籍者，該當事國可選派本國法官一人，與國際法院原有十五位法官共同審案。據說阿爾巴尼亞因爲本國沒有精通英文或法文的法官，因此就請了斯拉伐克國家法院院長來任它的法官。各法官剛剛坐定，新聞記者携照相機，爭向法官英阿代表律師與來賓席攝取照片。（未完）</p>
<h3>蘇聯幕後策動捷克政變　美促採集體行動　安理會定下星期四再開</h3>
<p>〔合衆社成功湖廿三日電〕美國廿三日要求聯合國澈底調査共黨僭取捷克政權之幕後事件。美代表夙斯汀稱，若安理會能證明蘇聯策動最近之捷克政變，安理會應採取「集團行動」以挽救遭遇同樣命運之其他人民。奧斯汀要求安理會聽取所有可能關於捷克政變之證明。若對蘇聯之斥責係具體化者，則此項斥齊將構　蘇聯有問接侵略之事件。</p>
<p>然美國官員已明悉安理會不致超越空談之階段，蓋蘇聯有五强之否決權也。奧斯汀所提及之「集團行動」，乃聯合國採取手段之謂。按根據聯合國憲章，准允爲「自衛」而採取政治及軍事行動以防止侵略。</p>
<p>奧氏之要求安理會行動，乃答　蘇聯代表葛羅米柯之廿六頁長篇演說，葛氏稱，捷克事件乃英美「戰爭販子」欲控制歐洲及擴軍心理所促成者。葛氏斥責美國干涉法國，義大利，希臘及土耳其之事件。但奧斯汀立即答覆稱此項斥責並不正確之外，並不能使捷克人民自奴役中解。奧斯汀要求提出捷克政變之事實後，安理會即吿休會。捷克事件之辯論停會至四月一日，並準備於廿四日考慮美國廢棄巴勒斯坦分治計劃以代暫時託管制度之建議。</p>
<h3>英美人士指責朝鮮委員會</h3>
<p>認爲該會處置不當</p>
<p>〔路透社東京二十四電〕甫自朝鮮來日之英美人士吿本社稱，朝鮮局勢急遞惡化，更在外界所想像之上，外界所傳關於韓國人民軍之傳說，確係事實，北韓如有行動，一舉即可搗漢城。南韓除警察隊外，幾無實力可以阻擋之。某美國朝鮮問題專家稱，聯合國朝鮮委會使局勢愈爲混亂，五日間南韓舉行選舉時，恐僅李承晚之一派參加。聯合國委會初抵朝鮮時，聲譽甚隆，然以該會迅即干涉政治，遂使韓人失去信仰。該專家特別指責聯合國委會中之澳代表賈克生及加拿大代表貝特生，賈氏初即大駡南韓爲美國警察國，而聯合國委會抵韓後三月尙未公布南競被捕政治犯中任何一個人之姓名。</p>

<h3>中籤及齡壯丁對號　黃浦區名單昨公布　應征先後一時猶難決定</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕本市今年征兵六千名，於前日舉行間接抽籤後，已於昨日開籤對號。惟各區區長深恐名單公佈後，壯丁有逃亡之　，均表示異異議。兵役協會常務委員集議討論，決定先行公佈費浦區中籤壯丁名單，以觀反響。</p>
<p>前日密封保存黃浦區等十區壯丁名册之木櫃，於昨日下午三時一刻，由民政局長張曉崧親自啓封，黃浦區區民代表主席江兆虎區長程經遠等，到場證明。名册啓封後，由工作人員按照中　號碼次序詳細核對，迄五時許，將該區民國十六年出生之壯丁姓名，全部對出，茲將該區各保第一名中籤壯丁姓名及中籤號數，列誌如后：</p>
<p>保數　壯丁姓名　中籤號數</p>
<p>1　徐德培　９</p>
<p>2　樂俊鵬　９</p>
<p>3　魏樹春　125</p>

<p>19　章哲華　76</p>
<p>20　施家祿　9</p>
<p>21　錢祥源　100</p>
<p>22　錢傑　76</p>

<p>32　劉根發　5</p>
<p>33　韓龍寳　5</p>
<p>34　（無十六年生壯丁）</p>
<p>35　龔祥興　5</p>
<p>按該區共有三十五保，及齡壯丁九千二百餘名，配額二六七人，惟以各保配額數字，尙未呈報，故壯丁姓名雖經開出，何人須於本年度應征，一時猶難決定。</p>
<h3>三種年次依次征集</h3>
<p>據民政局軍事科姚科長表示，此次征兵配額，係以保爲單位，一俟各保詳細配額呈報後，即可分批公佈全部應征壯丁之各單，應征壯丁以十六年生者爲首批征集對象，但如該保無十六年生壯丁或壯丁不足配額時，仍得延長征集年次，以十五年及十四年出生者遞補。至於介保配額，係以及齡壯丁（除緩征及免禁役）之人數比例而分配，故中籤第一名，不一定即爲應征壯丁，以上列黄浦區三十五保之第一名中籤壯丁而論，因各保人數不多，十六年生壯丁之第一城「一八三」號，全部輪空，第二籤「一二五」號，亦僅中第三保一人，最多者爲第十三籤九號，三十五人內竟中二十一人之多。又昨日核對名册時，市民親往參議會或以電話詢問中籤壯丁姓名者，自晨至暮，相繼不絕，神情頗爲緊張云。</p>

<h3>治安當局破獲共匪秘密機構　拘獲數十人罪證確鑿　市長司令昨日聯合招待記者報告</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕昨日下午五時半，吳市長與宣司令在市府會議室，聯合招待記者，報吿上週間破獲一共匪在滬秘密機構並捕獲匪黨潛伏份子數十人之經過。首由吳市長報吿稱。最近有一潛伏本市之共匪向治安機關自首，根據所供給之情報，因此破獲共匪在本市之秘密機構，抄獲共匪陰謀活動之罪證甚多，其中包括工作報吿，密電碼，企圖破壞公用事業計劃，及名册等。市政府與警備司令部已按名册，拘獲數十八，俟偵審終結，即將各犯罪行連同證據一併公佈。明日（二十五日）將邀請市參議會·地方協會·市總工會·人權保障委員會·市敎育會·市商會·地方安全促進會·各界戡亂運動委員會等各民衆團體代表，觀看被捕各犯參加共匪活動之確實證據，以示政府對人民身體自由之重視，如無確實可靠之罪證，決不隨便拘捕，同時希望全市善良市民，勿輕信謠言，政府對各界人士，安份工人，決予確切保障。</p>
<p>潛入活動陰謀搗亂</p>
<p>繼由宣司令報吿謂：警備司令部前曾屢次獲得情報，謂共匪擬在國民代表大會開會時期大事搗亂，蘇北共匪亦擬在此時期內大批渡江　入京滬地區活動，本市治安機關早已特別注意。迨上週有一共匪前來自首，供出在滬秘密機構之地址，因此順利破獲，抄得共匪在本市潛伏份子之名册，册上所列盡爲數字號碼，並非姓氏名號，治安機關根據此項綫索，已拘獲歡十人，其中以工人居多，滬南·滬西·滬東各工廠區均有。此外尙有數十人，須等繼續拘捕。惟殘餘共匪，可能藉此煽動，製造風潮，當局現已預爲防範。</p>
<p>善良市民決予保障</p>
<p>爲昭示政府尊重人權起見，特於明日（二十五日）邀請各民衆團體代表觀看被捕諸犯確實罪證，以明政府對善良工人，及市民身體自由，決不任意侵凌，而所以拘捕共匪份子，其意義亦即在保障善良。被捕各犯蔣依法審訊，按情節輕重，分別處置。此次拘獲大批共匪，與前不同，蓋今茲步　，係先將機破獲，然後按照名册　以拘捕，故　行絕對確實。同時並搜獲共匪破壞公用事業計劃及去年工潮·學潮之工作報告等大批證據，故決無誤捕情事。繼謂：經此次肅淸後，共匪潛伏本市之殘餘勢力，已大吿削弱，其計劃在四五月間發動之陰謀，實現已不可能，五百萬市民可吿安居樂業。近日謠傳共匪已在某處渡江等說，皆屬不確，江南警衛力量濃厚，長江中有海軍巡邏，淞滬區域戒備週密，有恃無恐，確保無慮。</p>
<p>依法嚴辦決不姑息</p>
<p>最後吳市長又補充稱：共黨可並利用被捕諸犯家屬哭哭啼啼，發動苦肉計，然政府決依法嚴辦，不稍姑息，至在逃各犯希其前來自首，當可從輕處斷。被捕各犯他日是否移適特種法庭，或其他司法機關，現尙未定，惟按其非行，將依最近公佈之「戡亂期間危害民國條例」處理。宣司令並補充謂自　可照自首減刑辦理。稍假時日，全案詳細過情形即可公佈。</p>
<p>聯台招待記者會上，宜司令起立報吿。右爲吳市長（本報攝）</p>

<h3>軍用汽車保養制度</h3>
<p>〔本報重慶十四日航訊〕今年三月，軍用汽車採行了五級保養制度。軍政部汽車修理總廠，合併了仰光車身廠，重慶汽車修理廠，特種車修造廠才改編爲今日華西區最大規模的四級第六修理廠。</p>
<p>早在一九三八年，美國的汽車工程雜誌，便已否定了修理，力言預防與換配的重要。可是到汽車工廠參觀一下，便　知道：雖然聯勤總部在各地實施了各級工廠保養制度，可是軍車不損壞則已，如果一出毛病，準是送進四級修理廠。因此，反映在全國各級修理工廠的現象是：二，三級廠少有車修，四級廠却又永遠修不完車。</p>
<p>按照美國的標準：一級保養爲各車駕駛士乒備有隨車工具一套自行保養。二級負責檢驗各車隊之修理，調整各部潤滑。三級則爲千公里以上定期保養，調換鋼板，化油器，白金，發電機等。四級係在固定地區設廠，担負車輛全部整修，引擎，差速箱等調換。五級則是製造廠，利用廢車材料製造機件及新車。現在中國有兩座汽車製造廠，綦江，上海各一，都是後勤總部的附屬單位。</p>
<p>汽車由我們駕駛，往往連一級保養都說不上，不是剎車油或滑油欠缺，便是配件不够，以致一，二級保養無法完成任務。而各種精密的工具儀器如蒸汽沖洗機，發電心子試驗器，剎車來令磨機，尤非一一于級修理廠所匪齊備。朱廠長鶴琴說得好：「四級修理廠就像個萬能的醫生，紅藥水固然要給病人塗搽，開刀剖腹這一套手術更免不了。」</p>
<p>據記者所知道，重慶區的距重部隊大半駐紮山洞。山洞輜離土橋的第六廠有四十公里之遠，送修部隊節省汽油，每時十餘輛壞車零件，拆集一車拖送入廠修理。於是大修一車，比修十輛還費勁。據悉：目前行駛川，黔，滇的輜重車輛，共有三千七百五十輛左右，全憑渝，筑兩個四級廠負責保養，工作誠屬艱鉅。</p>
<p>朱鶴琴廠長畢業於交　學校第一期，民國十八年即參加了輜重勤務是們經驗豐富的工程師。他的口號是：「工作即幸福，懶惰是罪惡。」自稱是：有軌電車，一切動作都按照軌道行走，所以全廠三百餘機工，對他旣敬又畏，晚間少有外出，均在俱樂部飲茶（一百元一杯），看報，奕棋，聽播音，朱廠長曾坦白對記者面述：假若六廠有什麽成績，那得歸功於美資運輸處已處長雨生，川東供應局邱局長的領導。</p>
<p>可是，儘管如此，如果不設法充實及加强華西區的汽車保養機構，僅　模倣美國的制度，收效仍是有限。戰時，在華美軍使用的車輛，總數有一萬八千除輛，行　川，黔，滇及湘桂　區公路綫上。其間雖只配備兩個特級廠（簡稱）URP　Unit　Recor,itioning　Plant　專門整修廢車及機件）三個四級廠，七個三級廠，但因爲它們設備充裕，合符分級保養制度的條件，也就事半功倍了。（本報特派員歐陽醇）</p>

<h3>巡視許昌〔窮人翻身〕</h3>
<p>〔本報鄭州十七日航訊〕在許昌城裏的有些牆上，還隱隱約約看到『開倉濟貧』的標語。我們知道共匪是以打富救貧爲號召的，就來看看共匪做的這一個工作怎樣？確實，共匪第一接近是窮人，起初是說他們要救濟窮人，但不知那些是窮人，要這些窮人都出來。然後，在每條街上，成立一個窮人會，舉了窮人頭，同時把窮人分了：頭等窮，二等窮，三等窮。於是打聽加些窮人，在你這條街上，誰的有錢，誰的最有錢。當晚最有錢的，比較有錢的，就成了『國特』，把有錢的人，押了起來，要他交出東四來。第二天共匪領了窮人會，去鬥爭，一些揀下來的東西，分給窮人，一次還每人分過斗把米。這樣以後，窮人就像鐵路一樣翻了身，成爲廢物。旣領不到救濟糧，也找不到工作做，最後也曾跟着共匪去搶過幾家磨坊。一千多個小車工人，被組織了後，失了業；河北旅許同鄕會的人說：『原來我們只有八十人失業，共匪一到，就有二百儿十人失業，等於州十分之三的人失業。』這怪誰呢？這時候共匪也不照顧照顧了。還爲一件事情，也是共匪的奇蹟，就是禁絕了妓女。然而妓女找到了什麽工作，沒有能回答了。</p>
<p>在許昌採到的共匪報紙，只看到過一次是關心一個窮人的。是一個賣油條的窮人，抬了一根枕木來炸油條，共匪的報上，把他大吹大擂了一塲。</p>
<p>靠鐵路吃飯的窮人完了，靠拉車推車的窮人完了，靠洗衣補衣的窮人完了，靠出買肉體的妓女的窮人也完了，還有些什麽樣窮人好的？有的，一些做小呌化子的窮人是好了，那些做小呌化子的窮人到這家非要二三千不可，到那家非要四五千不可，他們要來的錢，買了鞭炮，擲炮，到一些女人面前劈劈拍拍放了一陣，嘻嘻哈哈笑了一陣，很是得了共匪的光。這些小呌化子隨着共匪來的，也隨着共匪走了，永遠地似的受着共匪的照顧，過着快樂的日子。在共匪未到的時候，只買三萬元一斗，後來，一漲漲到八萬十萬，糧是一天一天被共匪裝了走，漲價就是這樣起來，要是共匪再不趕跑了，許昌的老百姓，十九要餓着肚子。老百姓說：『國軍再遲幾天來的話，我們不知道要有多少出去跑荒呢』有些貨色的老百姓，因爲共　冀南銀行的僞幣硬要二十五作一，都是不得已才賣出一些東西，換進一些東西，所以賣買是談不上的。過年的時候，老百姓很少去買肉吃的，一來錢不多，二來怕鬥爭。共匪很生氣，說：『我們在這裏，你們也不過年了？』</p>
<h3>土改與參軍</h3>
<p>在共匪的宣傳品上，滿紙都是說的『土改』（土地改革）與『參軍』。『土改』這一工作，在許昌的鄉下也做了，但還沒有做到『參軍』的階段。誰都一淸楚，『土改』是土匪的一種勾引老百姓「參軍」的手段。共匪冀魯豫日報十一月二日在太行，太岳，冀南，冀魯豫先後掀起參軍熟潮的一條消息裏就自己說明了：『翻身農民子弟，已湧入解放軍者，達若干萬人以上。』在同日另一條關於婦女工作，一條消息裏，有『要發動貧苦婦女參加土地改革工作』的話，那末不是明明說明男子去『參軍』後，去婦女來耕種土地嗎？共匪　傳的上雖然滿紙　張『參軍』熱潮，但有些地方也沒法掩蓋，老百姓不願『參軍』的情緒，就在那一天的報俗上有『婦女雖口頭上說不拉腿，但仍是消極的，並未發展到送郞送子『參軍』的話，並有如下的記載：『開始新戰士見了穿黄色軍衣的幹部說話又聽不懂，就亂咕唧說：「這大概是領咱這一班子新兵吧，不知把咱帶往那裏去？」有個別的戰士說：「不？，就看眼色行事。」（意思是開小差）』『這個地方不好，我們趁機可跑？』關於『參軍』實在的情形，每個俘虜都爲同口異聲地吿訴你一句「不參不行」的一句話。做爹爹的沒法，做娘的也沒法，因此有這裏五千，那裏一萬的「參軍」了。</p>
<p>因爲大批人員的『參軍』，『土改』運動就成了落空，什麼依靠『僱貧農爲骨幹，澈底完成土改』呀，『僱貧農親自動手動口起來幹』呀，都是白嚷的。所謂『八項禁令十項要求』內的禁止大吃大喝，禁止宰殺傷害耕牛，破壞農具，以及要吃糠嚙菜省糧食，要家家早種春菜改糧食，要防荒，要愛茂楡·柳·楊樹和洋槐，要多種春麥等，也成爲一遍空話。事實是這樣，在共匪豫皖蘇行署關於目前財政工作的指示（一九四八年一月廿八日發）各專員縣長說得明明白白：『邊區的財糧和經濟情况，目前已面臨困難！主要的表現於老解放區各縣。財糧上是普遍的麥根枯竭，秋糧的現糧不多，而在地區上則收支很不平衡，以至某些地區在麥秋方面都有借支民糧的現象，又因戰爭情况和戰勤工作沒有及時的調劑贖還，財糧收支上對上解的保證不够，個別單位竟支付了存款，以致影響經費收支，軍費支出又因透支吿罄而大感侷促，糧款變價則在地區上有分散收款與集中收支的矛盾，在時間上又緩不濟急，並受物價上漲的損失。經濟上則本幣受戰爭影響波動甚大，一方面市塲縮少，法幣活躍，另方面則普遍地物價飛漲，幣値下降，邊沿與中心區，中心區離戰塲遠的和近的區域之間，物價與幣値的不平衡，較之以往更爲懸殊。個別市自已有拒收本幣或自發罷市的現象，而邊沿區物資外流法幣時侵的現象，亦仍很嚴重。比比一切已經够說明困難，但還只困難的開始，戰爭還在繼續進行，敵人主力仍有一部盤據在我中心區未退，而距離麥收（收成好壞，尙不可知，）還有五個整月！』這個指示裏於是要求『掌握現　是財政工作中的最基本的一環。』其辦法是征借，『老地區因軍用及戰勤頻繁，現有存糧，不敷收支太多。必須征借。』共匪「土改」之後，發生嚴重糧荒，是對『土改』運動極大的諷刺。因爲由『土改』運動而進入『參軍』運動的，『土改』運動旣然垮了台，那『參軍』運動也必要到一倡垮台的地步。這是共匪沒有方法來消滅的一個大矛盾。（本報記者范世動）</p>

<h3>拼死吃河豚　無錫兩男子中毒身死</h3>
<p>〔本報無錫廿三日訊〕江陰與鎭江間之江面，每年二三月間，即有大量「河豚」出現，每尾重約一斤至四斤，頭小腹大，漲氣如鼓，沿江居民，常捕捉洗凈，和以豬肉烹調，有「一吃河啄百味全無」之譽。惟該魚含有大量毒素，其眼珠，卵巢，血液，均須特別檢出剔除，再將魚身翻覆，用淸水洗凈，烹煮時並用蘆蓆蓋鍋灶工部，以防塵灰飄入，若偶一不愼，必致肇禍。故非沿江一帶之居民，如無絕對把握，均不敢輕於嘗試。昨日上午，本邑惠農橋旁有蘇北籍苦力李振邦，（六七歲），陳一淸，（四十歲），兩名，於出外拾荒時，在垃圾堆上檢得河豚腸若干，李因不知此物含有毒性，以爲天錫佳肴，返家後即加烹調，詎食後即毒性發作，嘔吐不止，腹中奇痛，歷數分鐘，即倒地而死，後由當地岡正，投報地檢處派員前往相驗，委係中河豚毒身死，因無屍屬認領，即命圖正備棺收殮。</p>

<h3>中國學術研究的前程　（上文接第二版社論）</h3>
<p>第二，是社會的同情和資助。趨重「經世致用」的傳統學風，似乎與我們一般社會「急公近利」的風氣，互爲因果。所以純粹學術硏究之不求近功和名利，其受社會的蔑視和冷酷，可說由來已久，却是於今爲烈、。在戰後經濟劇變的今日，「疾風」幾乎已偃及「勁草」，我們似不易遽挽頹波；要使囤積爲</p>
<p>腹賈來尊重學者，捐資於硏究事業，可說是太理想了。然而事在人爲，移風在漸，我們不能不期待由政府的「禮賢崇學」，與學術工作者的自重，漸漸增加社會對智識份子的廣泛同情。最近新企業家漸多和外國企業家接觸，工商界領袖當能漸知資助專門研究是有益於企業成功的，我們也可以此來激勸積資財而有識的人，漸漸與學術事業發生關係。英美資本家以巨額遺產獎助硏究事業，以及若干大企業基金之有助於科學進步，不是値得我們盡力宣揚和設法仿行麼？</p>
<p>第三，是學術界本身的自重。如果在歐美的科學家値得世人的尊重，我以爲今日中國的學者，耐着生活的煎迫，妻孥的交謫，社會的冷漠，而猶埋頭研究，保其故我，才眞是難能可貴。我們相信行將誕生的一百位院士，多數是從甘於淡泊，甘於寂寞中磨練出來，而猶將其餘力從事其寂寞的工作之人才。今後中國學術進步的前程，有賴於這一輩院士樹之楷模，蔚成風氣。而對於一般從事研究工作者，包括不捨硏究工作的敎授們，我們更切望其格外珍重，爲中國學術多留種子，多種好因，來開創未來文化的光輝。安定他們的生活，是政府與社會共同的責任。學術界「盡其在我」，還得勉存一般淸明和易　氣度，不以生活不滿移其志，不以世俗名利損其功。在我們文明古國中，眞正卓有造詣富有希望的學者實在太少了，我們不能不本責備賢者之旨，期望他們更能虛心一志，相互合作，以「無所爲」和鍥而不捨的精神，對中國學術盡其最大的貢獻。</p>
<p>第四，國際學術合作的助力。在今日中國學術研究進展中已多表現，當然是完成中國學術獨立之一個重要因素。我們於此，只要略提已往的事例，和當前優良的趨勢，頗有使我們樂觀的理由。有如中國地質學之得外國學者合作與本身努力而得到燦爛成績，已予我們各部門科學家和科學團體以重大的鼓勵；而戰時中國科學家在艱苦條件下所得之良好成緩，也頗得各國學者的好評，英國李約瑟博士（原譯名尼德漢）返英後替中國官說，是其著例。二年來許多國際科學會議，我國都應邊已派或將派專家出席；這與聯合國一般敎育合作的趨勢是同樣令人樂觀的。今後我們一面應善於運用已有的文化專款，接受國際精神和物質的協助，並且有計劃的延攬外籍專家來華請授，或協助工作，而更要緊的，是藉國際的同情與合作，來積極　强自身的努力。</p>
<p>第五，學術硏究環境的安定。在今日的中國，專門硏究機構十分稀少，各種專門學術硏究的工作，大部分還是在普通大學或學院中進行，多數硏究工作者可說與第一流大學的敎授是不能分離的。他們在生活艱苦敎導辛勤之中，以餘力來從事硏究，若使其環境不得寗靜，怎能望其有良好的成績？可是近二年來，大學風潮迭起，罷課時聞，一呼百應，敝屣課業，對敎授學者的地位與工作，幾已成爲一種强烈的諷刺和威脅。我們常見到軍警執行逮捕事件，間有波及大學生而引起了騷擾，或校長辭聘若干敎授而造成了糾紛。我們對此，不能不　請政府當局在尊重學術與思想自由大原則之下，對於敎師學生的言諭，除去確有政治陰謀危及治安者外，應予以最大的寬容。然而宣傳敎條與探求眞理決不能並存，暴力脅制或停輟課業則斷然是科學文化之敵。凡是破壞安定和學術進步的活動，該是純潔的學者所不許的。那麽，謀學府硏究環境的安定，是否應有學術上公論的制裁，還是僅視爲敎育行政上的事情呢？</p>
<p>要之，中國學術研究的理想目標，當然要完成中國的學術獨立，與並世各國在學術上立在平等的地位。現在距離學術獨立——有如胡適之先生所倡導「在十年中建立起學術獨立的基礎」——的目標雖然還遠，但以現在已有的成就和當前的趨勢，我們確已在曙光中見到光明的遠景。此次硏究院「院士」的誕生，必然更能獎進我們專家學者的努力，引起國際學術界良好的觀感，使我們邁步走上荘嚴的行程，完成中國學術獨立建國成功的使命。（完）</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕本市私立中小學開學至今已達月餘，敎局接獲學生家長報吿超收學費之學校甚多。李代局長熙謀對此甚爲重視，特於昨日上午親赴各校抽査收費情形，昨日被查者有四校，日內有暇將繼續至各校抽査。據李代局長吿記者：此次赴各校抽査之點爲：（一）經濟是否公開？收費是否用之於敎師福利？（二）免費壓額是否合於標準或儘量擴充？（三）學生人數是否有過擠情形？如超收之費，用之於公，爲敎師謀福利，則尙可原諒。有數校，校方於開學時一次發給敎職員六個月薪水者，敎局對此點將加鼓勵。此次抽查結果，辦理成績特別優良之學校，將予獎勵。其辦理不善者，亦擬加以懲處，獎懲學校之名單均擬予以公佈。</p>
<h3>世運足球預選一波三折　問題中心在於星島　容啟兆示王正廷</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕我國參加世運足球代表隊預選事宜，一波三折，陷入僵局，迄未解決。最初盛傳星島隊不參加世運預選，將用胡好率領赴南美，出國之聲，後又銷沉。上海埠際隊赴港，原擬兼作世運預選，復匆匆北返。選拔委員會主席容啓兆博士飛行於港滬之間，迄未能將人事問題解決。迨爪哇華僑足球隊抵港參加預選，董守義飛港參加談判，返滬發表談話，形勢似又好轉。但本報接獲港電報吿，謂馬來亞華僑電港，表示反對桌上選拔，堅持須參加預選，港方亦有主張重行分區選拔，改組選拔委員會，星島忽又有投效廣州警察隊，出席全運，不參加世運預選等等，事情又重起波折。昨日聯合社港電，更明白說明胡好推荐星島隊代表出席世運，則其中曲折，眞相揭開，似一切問題中心，在於星島。足球選拔會主席容啓兆博士已由港返滬，本報記者昨往訪晤，據云：馬來亞電港反對，確右其事。敎育部曾中駐海外使館轉知各地僑胞參加全運會，但並未說明世運預選中之籃球田徑游泳在全運會中選拔，而足球則單獨在香港舉行，因此發生誤會，以爲祗參加全運，而不赴港。爪華隊離吧城時，亦好久才弄明白淸楚。馬來亞旣要求參加，自應予以機會，惟因出國期近，已限其於四月底前到港，否則時間所限祗能作爲放棄論。選拔會亦並非改組，祗加聘了幾位。至於其他一切問題，以及代表隊之人選等等，將請示王正廷博士後，作一最後決定云。</p>

<h3>胡適過滬晉京　出席中研究院士評議會</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕胡適博士，夾着健康的春意，從北方高原南來。昨日主特協和醫學院董事會後，當晚搭車晋京，出席今日在京舉行的中央硏究院院士評議會。二十九日並出席國民大會。博士此行，負有三重重大任務，可謂不虛了。</p>
<p>從多次造訪博士得到個寳貴的經驗，博士最怕無條件的接見記者，請他發表一個哲人兼史家對於　是的意見。昨大是例外，也算幸運，老人在煩忙中，和幾個拜訪他的記者，在摩天大厦國際飯店十三樓，暢談了一個多鐘頭。他把協和醫學院董事會的重大決定，全盤托出。記者像在敎授家裏聽課，筆落紙頭，嘶嘶有聲，這在博士有如小橋琉水，直瀉無　。</p>
<p>全國醫藥人才多是協和產品</p>
<p>從協和醫學院六十八萬餘的美金預算，折合市面流行的黑市價値談起，他用筆將兩個數目字，湊成一個數目字，使他驚訝，也連稱「羡慕」。他說：「恐怕目前全國大學敎育經費的總和，也不及協和這一個預算數目字。」話題很自然的轉到他去年對記者發表的十年學術獨立計劃上，雖然他揮手不願讀下去，他還是情不自禁的拿「協和」來做比喩了。</p>
<p>博士認爲每年以洛氏基金六十八萬餘美元，來專心致力培養一個協和醫學院。表面上看這個數目字的花費很大，其實，今日全國各地有成就的醫藥護士人才，幾乎全是「協和」的「產品」，從而教養出更多的人才，這種無形的收獲，値得好好的盤算一下。因此，他主張政府在重質不重量的原則下，集中力量，於短時間內來辦十個好大學，在洛氏「一能」之，在國家應「十能」之。雖然他這個計劃發表，各方反響不同。以整個國家觀點來看，他還堅持爲必需之論。如今，國家財力不濟，這個計劃，也祗是個計劃而已。</p>
<p>希望今日蘇聯勿蹈歷史覆轍</p>
<p>從又一個轉角，把話題引到歷史的邊緣上。博士認爲廿餘年來，全世界發生了兩個大悲劇。一是德國兩次的覆亡，一是日本的戰敗。兩個國家，都苦幹了幾十年，積了多少心力，建立成爲大國。而因一念之差，毀於一旦。言下似有無限感慨。他說，當日本侵華之初，我一再警吿日本，不要自己毀滅他辛苦幾十年積下的努力，結果，却有今日。以同樣心情，他也希望今日的蘇聯，消極的無害於人，積極的有利於人，成爲世界上一個大國，而備受各國的　往，勿蹈歷史的覆轍，自己毁滅自己。他說在「胡適文存」，「胡適留美日記」，及當年他與徐志摩在蘇聯的通訊中，都留有這種嚮往於蘇聯的心跡。</p>
<p>鄙斥孤立主義　並鄙斥華萊士</p>
<p>談到國內博士重申了他的「和比戰難」的看法，和旣不可能，祗好不言「和」。他絕不願意「算命」，說將來誰勝誰負。記者把問題扯到美國大選上，他說現在還看不出，照習慣共和黨於六月，民主黨於七月開會，提出候選人後，才能窺其端倪。他認為美國第三黨華萊士，代表美國孤立主義的復活。華氏出生的衣阿華州，就是美國中部的農業社會。以一個孤立主義者執政，對世界，尤其對中國是不利的。他看華萊士絕不可能在今年當選，在他私人說，他是不希華氏當選的，他鄙斥華萊士，鄙斥孤立主義再現於今日的世界。</p>
<p>語未盡意，有客造訪。同業請辭，問他這次出席國大，投誰一票呢？他笑說：「我不能吿訴你們」您應該尊重我們選　的意見呀。」記者遂與握手道別。（其容）</p>

<h3>紗管會重視棉供應問題　已訂妥美棉卅萬包　第一批十萬包下月底可運到</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕紗管會袁主委昨答復記者詢問稱：（一）該會近着重原棉供應問題，以外棉為主，國棉為副。最近已向美訂妥原棉三批，計三十萬包。首批十萬包，四月底五月初可絡續到埠。關於收購國棉，已托紡建公司及棉商代收。至湖北棉商請求事，原則已允委託代購，手續正在洽商中。（二）代紡代織實施細則及六區公會所提補充辦法九項，經濟部已批準，俟首批外棉到埠後，即可實施。（三）據傳一個月後，日本紗布將向南洋大量傾銷，以其成本較低，該會今後當設法加强棉紗在外銷，俾可爭取國外市場，同時亦可藉以收購原棉。又關於外傳該會開放紗布南運事，袁主委稱，並無其事。外傳上海紗廠將有十餘家遷港設廠一事，袁主委認爲香港雖爲華南吐納港，原料供應，較為方便。惟香港氣候不宜紡織，且輸運困難，遷廠一說，事實上困難尙多，實現不易。</p>
<h3>紗布交換印棉　外銷會在積極輸中</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕關於紗布交換印棉，原訂換率，已由外銷會第十二次委員會議決定推張委員似旅榮委員一心，袁副主任委員仲逵，劉主任秘書建華，宋副主任秘書立峰負責辦理。並爲顧及各廠機會均等起見，特規定由各合於外銷產品之廠家，增加掉換量三分之一。以所得棉花分給其他產品不合外銷之廠家，以示相互合作。其次各廠生產總量第二個百分之十，向外銷會掉換棉花，以現存棉不敷全數交換，經決定交換之棉花在五百包以下者照掉，五百包以上者按比例分配。又中國棉織業聯營公司擬以外銷所得外匯向外銷會換購棉紗，並自願放棄輸管會所規定應得外匯百分之四十購買原料之權利。外銷會已予同意，惟所換棉紗應切實用於複製，並以輸出成品所需同等原料爲限云。</p>
<h3>銀根緊·去化呆　棉紗步步下降　布疋賣氣旺盛價亦續挫</h3>
<p>昨日棉紗市况，因値紡建公司開紗之期，配售額子頗多，業中銀根更形軋緊，市上去化客帮呆頓，本街亦稀，市價步步下降。</p>
<p>四十二支藍鳳細紗，晨開即跌進二億元大關，爲一億九千六百萬元。嗣經複製業抵補，檯面帮亦來拉抬，重叩二億關邊，但以曇花一現，即吿下挫，低至一億七千六百萬元收市，比之上日賡續劇瀉二千八百萬元之鉅。</p>
<p>二十一支雙馬棧單套利交易，尙覺活躍，以一億〇三百萬結束，現雙馬實銷仍鮮開展，收價低見一億〇六百萬，較之上日均跌九百萬元。此外二十支各級續跌一成餘，大多跌進一億大關。十六支及十支等粗紗，破入九千萬關，狂跌有百分之十二左右。</p>
<p>昨日棉布市况，因銀根未鬆，且外埠市面反低，價格倒懸，客帮頻有吐售，北帮雖有納意，但套匯頭寸頗緩，行莊匯款困難，因此欲振乏力，散戶及布商均以利空消息紛傳，競相爭脫，塲內賣氣籠罩。</p>
<p>十二磅龍頭細布，初開即挫六萬，爲三百九十萬元。嗣以零星需吸尙佳，市勢稍見回好，但不久山西帮突來大量吐出，門莊帮亦有拋賣，布號斬售頗夥，賣風四起，市價轉見下瀉。龍頭細布一直下降至三百八十三萬元，迨近午收時，北帮見低略有收吸，回升至三百九十五萬。後聞紗市不振，復又回小至三百八十九萬收市，比之上日續跌七萬元，但較塲外軋落十九萬元。</p>
<p>其餘各檔細布，價亦步降自二萬至十萬元，四君子直貢及嗶嘰，以吐售較多，軋小二十萬許。此外漂布粗布及色布士林布等行情，亦都跟低一二十萬元不等。</p>
<p>又訊：隔日紡建供售之雙飛龍細布，曾倒貼十四萬元，爲三百四十八萬元有成交，中途一度平掉，最後尙須貼七八萬元，方有買進，聞以套買者佔多數云。</p>
<p>紡建售紗</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕紡建公司昨循例開售棉紗計十種，申購單共二三九張，六七〇件，合二十支紗九五三·五件。</p>

<h3>工商輔導處推進　本市電化工業</h3>
<p>經濟部上海工商輔導處昨發表我國電化工業槪况，及今後推進辦法如次：</p>
<p>（一）電化工業之重要性　電化工業最重要而且規模最大者爲食鹽電解工業，其產品有燒碱漂白粉，液體氣，鹽酸，氯酸鉀，金屬鈉等產品。此等產品與工業關係甚切。</p>
<p>（二）中國電化工業近况　我國電化工廠，現在開工者有天原電化廠，臺灣碱業公司，上海大中電化廠，江南電化廠，中光電化廠，六合電化廠，華昌電化廠，天津化學工業廠，瀋陽東北化工廠，靑島中紡化工廠等，最高產量，每月可達九百十五噸，現在月產六百五十噸左右。應用純碱鹼化所製之碱水，不計在內。</p>
<p>（三）目前困難情形　（一）上海各電化廠在抗戰時期，頗爲發達。勝利後因舶來品源源轍入，大冬數改營他種工業，一時甚難恢復。（二）上海電力不足，電極購買不易，故開辦電化廠頗感困難。</p>
<p>（四）推進辦法　（一）規定在台灣設立電化工廠之獎勵辦法，並准許新式電化機器之進口。（二）上海電化廠籌備復工者，予以接電之便利。</p>
<p>（五）預定效果　（一）在臺灣於三年內設立每月可以生產二千噸燒碱之電化工廠，（二）在一年內上海未復工之電化廠如天泰化工廠等，絡續可以生產。</p>
<h3>公布的許可輸入　到埠後未能提貨</h3>

<p>〔本報訊〕本市各進口商，前憑公布前輸入許可證到埠貨物，因信用狀外匯發生問題，以致迄今未提貨。而各貨已於去年年底前到埠，均屬生產器材及工業原料等國內缺乏之品，並已早有合法之公佈前許可證領到在案。本市進出口公會以長此久懸，進口商損失綦鉅，特電請中央銀行，對於進口商所開公佈前輸入許可證之信用狀，其外匯業經先用者，請以現行掛牌匯率，與開信用狀時之匯率計其差額，以法幣償還指定銀行，轉解國行，作爲抵補，准予通知鹼管會簽證提貨，俾懸案得以早日解決云。</p>

<p>農民銀行浙江分行經理關龍蓀，日前赴京出席行務會議。會後來滬，據談，該區農貸配額，爲一萬零五百億元。合作金庫佔三千四百餘億，本行六千五百餘億。三月份貸放六百九十億，仍以糧食棉花增產爲重心。其次爲茶，蠶絲，漁業，土地金融等項。按本區之實際需要，本年度至少需三萬億，目前數字僅六千餘億，與原計劃出入甚大，然亦當儘力推行國策，本區農民組織基礎，較爲鞏固，農貨工作，並無若何困難。</p>
<h3>茶市堅定</h3>
<p>甫吿平定之茶市，昨又展開劇力之漲風，推厥原因，外銷茶自法屬比菲頻加靑睞後，出口商之買氣頗盛，爭相怒茁。至於內銷花色，國內各地亦多問津，但市上存底迄未遞增，且距離產新期尙有時日，是以賣戶態度，咸圖堅守，不忍割愛。乃過松大有求逾於供之象，交易雖屬平庸，而市氣遂見步挺，底盤亦甚鞏固。</p>
<h3>臺糖配價提高　每担普加五五萬</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕本市物價評議會食糖小組，昨日下午，在社會局舉行第二十四次評議會，因臺糖成本增加，合幣匯率調整頻繁，並因台糖配價與市價相差過鉅，商人競相爭取，乃有舞弊情形發生，故決定提高配價，使與市價接近，則斜弊情形不致　生。</p>
<p>會中經評議決定台糖公司第十三期配價如下，較上期每担普加五五萬元。</p>
<p>計特號砂白，每担配售價四二五萬元，一號砂白四一〇萬元，二號砂白三九五萬元，　三號砂白三六五萬元，赤砂糖三八〇萬元，台灣靑糖三五〇萬元，特號棉白，四三五萬元，一號棉白四二〇萬元，二號棉白四〇五萬元氷糖五八〇萬元。</p>
<p>評議會並決定今後評議會。改爲每週開會一次，（原爲二週一次，）配糖付款期限亦將縮短。</p>
<p>劃盤步跌</p>
<p>昨糖市因台公司配價已決定調整，靑赤白糖均加五十五萬元，氷糖加七十萬元，惟以銀根奇緊而實銷不振，故公會劃盤不漲反跌。如現貨二四粗白爲四百七十萬元至六十八萬元，小十五六萬元。四半白尙平，袋裝五百十萬元，草包四百九十萬元。二〇中砂白小十萬元，爲四百十七萬元至廿萬元。台赤直接來貨僅四百萬元，棧單交易午後降一二十萬元。</p>
<p>土糖成交寥寥，再度見軟，汕提靑二百九十八萬元至九十六萬元，小三四萬元。興化白四百四十五萬元，興赤三百萬元，各小五萬元。刁靑二百七十萬元，小十萬元。海南赤二百二十萬元，小八萬元。</p>
<h3>本月份農業貸款國行準先辦透支　期限一月利息四分</h3>
<p>本年度農貸十五萬億，決分期貸放。三月份貸款總額，除台灣外共爲一萬四千七百五十億。農行李總經理叔明，特於昨日來滬，向中央銀行商洽轉抵押事宜。頃悉：此事與劉副總裁洽商結果，爲爭取時間計，決先以透支方式撥用，下月份再辦轉抵押。透支期限以一個月爲限，利率月息四分。各區各分行配得數額由中央銀行通知各分行就地撥用，透支照數十足支付，轉抵押係按九折辦理。</p>
<h3>民調會拋售申購甚稀　食米實銷仍呆滯　南北市白粳昨日微升數萬元</h3>
<p>米市跌後稍升，蓋前二日連跌之後，價已甚低，且已有與產地倒掛之象，貨主以成本關係，不肯輕脫，起而扳持，惟去化則尙不見活，故雖云上升，所漲實甚微也。</p>
<p>開市之初，貨主欲一挽頽勢，喊高十萬元，後因實銷仍呆，故仍回落，結果僅漲五萬元，北市白粳收市三百八十萬元，特高粳三百九十五萬元，薄稻上漲較多。民食調配會以三百四十萬開售早稻，惟購者不多。</p>
<p>麺粉初跌後回，結果稍見微升。初開承上之疲勢，市續下沉，老車粉開市祗一百四十五萬元，終因價低引起納胃，實銷觀望多日，紛紛乘低納取，收市回升至一百四十七萬五千，與上日平。兵船一百十六萬五千收市，紅蜂建成，更在散戶之爭取下，終高於上日一萬至一萬五千元。麩皮回漲至八十萬〇五千元。</p>
<p>雜糧一致受銀根之繼續緊俏貨主急於求脫，實銷及客帮均少問津。漢口乍豆一百八十萬，收市稍次者開一百七十五萬元，計降十萬之譜。苞米去路呆滯，高貨疲三五萬，菉豆續降五萬元，紅糧客帮不問訊，回落三四萬。芝蔴挫十萬，生仁廣帮不辦，亦降十萬元。</p>
<p>食油因銀根之緊勢有增無減，貨主因需頭寸，脫意均濃，油廠亦有開出。大有廠開豆油價七百四十七萬元，後回籠貨低至七百四十五萬，其他豆油均低至七百四十萬，各降十萬。生油到貨稍增，售戶頓多，靑島吉桶生油退入九百萬內，計挫二十萬元。生菜油降十餘萬，小車蔴油初小後升，結果反昂十萬。豆餅在供過於求下。降二三萬，中植廠開植字餅甚多。</p>
<h3>桐油絲蔴蛋品　英擬增加在華採購數量</h3>
<p>經濟部頃准外交部電稱，據該部駐倫敦領事館接得英商務部官員吉爾柏函稱：爲平衡中英貿易起見，有數種商品如蛋類，油種籽，桐油，植物油，生絲，超級廢絲，乾繭，苧蔴等，英國擬增加其在華採購數量。如我國能增加上列各種商品輸英數量，將有裨益於兩國貿易之發展。經部接電後，當即分電各有關主管機關，分別調査可能增加之輸英商品數量，以憑核復。</p>
<p>肥皂低跌</p>
<p>日用品肥皂市面，晨開時以同業採辦尙旺，檯面帮拉提頗勁，行情一度挺升。旋因捲菸回低，浮戶獲利有售，結果固本皂因派貨關係，籌碼充沛，一路直瀉至五百七十五萬元低價收市，比上日每箱狂跌十三萬元。箭刀皂亦降七萬元，爲五百四十五萬元。其餘光華美麗祥茂等皂，亦均回挫一二十萬及五萬元不一。</p>
<p>火柴市面，以美麗老牌本銷較活，回升二十萬元。新牌貨各方取捨不同，互有升沉。</p>
<p>火油市面，在銀根支配下，同業批發交易甚淸，頭寸軋緊者且有脫手，做價再吿下挫。高度桶貨低至一千八百五十萬元，軋降五十萬。美孚聽油二百萬左右有成交，零沽每提四萬五六千元，限價每斤仍爲三萬三千元。洋燭平穩，價無升降。</p>
<p>捲菸疲軟</p>
<p>昨日捲菸市况，初開因散戶見低有吸，十支大英價上升至九千八百萬元，老刀昂越八千萬關外，爲八千零五十萬。旋聞業外物價仍疲，更以廠家不斷派貨，同業銀根愈吿軋緊，乘高吐　甚多．</p>
<p>午後外埠同行回籠貨絡續傾吐，市勢尤虛。迨至最後，十支大英回低至九千四百萬收市，比上日續跌二百五十萬，老刀以七千六百萬低價結束，亦瀉二百萬元。</p>
<p>其餘華商條烟去化呆頓，亦均步降自二三千元至一萬許。惟「白蘭地船主十字軍」等牌仍覺挺秀，此外美貨條烟及五十支　烟市亦轉疲。</p>
<h3>內匯率修正</h3>
<p>四行兩局一庫之內匯率，頃經修正如次：　門一八〇元，泉州一八〇元，廣州一八〇元，海口二〇〇元，南　長沙衡陽各一〇〇元，蚱埠二〇元，漢口武昌各一二〇元，重慶成都各四〇元，萬縣一五〇元，冉州一二〇元。</p>
<h3>華股晨盤疲落　午後略有轉機</h3>
<p>華股昨晨盤迫於掉期，存多被業外回跌及港電上升之影響而下瀉。午後反動見盛，臨收忽俏。</p>
<p>晨開仍受美貸影響而見疲，永紗上塲爲一七九〇元及一七六〇元。旋降至一七五〇元及一七七五元，再升至一七六〇元及一七九五元。至是供售漸多，價又向下，迨補空一起，最後一度回升至一七四五元及一七七五元。逢高脫售者多，銀根仍屬緊迫，業外物資均跌，存多潰散，信誼慘吿跌停，永紗跌至一六五〇元及一六八五元低價。即交收市爲一六五二元，信誼亦稍回上。較前收計信和勤興信誼景綸中絲榮豐各跌一成，永紗商務　北統益新光火柴國貨新華永公麗安內衣中泥跌半成，餘均微挫。遞交股信和勤興跌一成，永紗新光跌半成，景福微抄。</p>
<p>後市遞交循例停做，即交以一六九〇元登場，自一六八〇元起，被進至一七二〇元。傳外匯今將調整，而工貸亦有助買流言，升爲一七四五元。港電報長，又退爲一七一五元。一一九號等速袂購買，國行差進有限，升爲一七六〇元。一四三號一五六號一九〇號賣出而有掙扎。景福埀靑者衆，已超過新光，收市爲一七五七元。較晨收計即交股閘北永紗榮豐大通信和新光永公景福內衣國貨升半成，新華勤興景福漲一成，華新跌半成，餘均微升。塲外各未上市股票均吿不振。</p>
<h3>統債回瀉　外股平疲</h3>
<p>公債昨下瀉不少，散戶維持，毫無效力。五〇〇室賣出，成交三百萬。統丙晨開一〇萬六，低至九萬元，而後稍定。較前收甲乙跌九千元，丙跌一萬八，丁挫一萬元，戊種跌一萬一。</p>
<p>外股昨以港電報長，刺激毫無，除航業等尙平外，均告不支。證券帮及散戶咸賣，洋商稍納。怡紗晨開一七一萬五，自一七六萬退入一七〇萬內結束。較前收計橡皮股及鋼業電話均平，航業微升，英聯跌半成，餘均微挫。</p>

<h3>當局嚴令禁止白銀流入匪區</h3>
<p>國防部因鑒於豫中共匪在大批搜括黄金及現洋，凡當地人民被其　票者，均須以黄金現洋贖取。月前新蔡縣境每塊現洋售價商達卅萬元，信陽漢口等地售價亦高至十三四萬元，故自由區常有發現偸運黄金及現洋至匪境者。該部昨特向本市轉知警察局重申禁令，（即三十六年一月九日所公佈之對匪區交通經濟封銷辦法及三十六年三月十二日公佈之禁運匪區物品辦法）切實限制金銀流入匪區，並令與匪區昆連之省縣市鄉鎭一律禁止使用現洋。違者査出決予沒收充公。茲悉警局即將於即日起，加强檢査買賣金銀之違法商號。</p>

<h3>評古音說略</h3>
<p>— 俞敏</p>
<p>陸志韋著　三十六年十月哈佛燕克　社出版</p>
<p>在每一門學問相當發達以後，要想再進一步，往往得靠着兩種力量；第一，有新材料發現，第二，材料還是那些個老玩藝兒，可是對他有一種新見解，新看法兒。自從高本漢領導起中國音韻學的研究以後，批評他，改正他的倒不是沒有。可是大多數兒都是些個細節的修正。在見解上，那怕是頂荒唐的見解，還沒見過不跟着他跑的。比方說，陸法言把好些個韻分得細極了，並且說「寅，甲與子同，乙與丑同，今俱別」，他的意思不過想分成三類，任憑甲把子寅合押，乙把丑寅通押，於是乎他的書誰都能使就是了。這旣不代表甲的語言，也不代表乙的語言，甲乙的語言雖說不一樣，可也都就有兩類。這點兒事並不難懂，可是就沒見過一個對於高的「一稱六百年左右的長安官話」提出異議的！這部書的著者，在見解上跟高有幾處不一樣，所以得出來的結果，也就不是高所範圍的住的。這幾點是著者得力的地方，也是他把音韻學從江有浩高本漢手裏又望前推了一步的地方兒。像根據寒桓歌戈不分韻的切韻殘卷把高的兩種合口的分別取消，倒不是　者拿手的活。</p>
<p>陳灃切韻考在支　祭眞仙宵庚淸侵鹽這幾韻的喉牙唇音裏，都有重出的小韻，韻鏡和七音略也把他們分列。可是高跟以「統計」標榜的白滌洲全都把這個現象一筆抹殺。著者可不那麼着：他在這上頭建立起他的一組單純，一組唇化喉牙音兩種！介音學說（見原書十頁）。這不光能把神琪的四聲五音九弄反紐圖把「何我…」算喉聲，「更硬…」算牙聲解釋的挺好，而且還能帮着著者得出好幾個重要結果來。第一，從「胥疽駔」對轉爲「相創壯」，「于無甫」對轉爲「往亡方」看來，好像魚開虞合。著者利用這個利器給證明了（五九，一五八頁）。第二，他把現代方言輕唇音發生的條件兒弄淸楚了（六二頁）。第三，他把李方桂高本漢聚訟不決的之蒸兩部的尤，屋三等，東三等的來源說得伏伏帖帖（一一〇頁以下）：這是者者頂大的貢獻。說起著者的得力的地方兒來，無非是不抹殺重出喉牙音的現象就是了。先前的人，除了章太炎先生在音理論裏用語源的眼光稍微討論了一下子以外，就都把他給忽略了。</p>
<p>切韻序裏說「先仙尤侯，俱論是切」。一向人家都當是他講韻哪。曾運乾才開始認爲他指得是聲紐。著者用統計的方法，把　淸從心的洪細音分開（有些個例外的來源是因爲子，七兩個字太好寫，跟聲音沒關係）。因此他順順當當兒的把高氏不顧日譯音而添到純四等韻上的—介音取消（六頁）。他又利用這種辦法，把莊初牀山的發音部位定得和照穿神審一樣，可添上圓唇，所以把陽韻亦二等在現代方言開口變合口解釋得很淸楚（十七頁）。</p>
<p>切韻序　還有「秦隴則去聲爲人」這麽句話。著者拿他解釋祭泰　廢爲什麽不合到　代什麼的上頭：無非是讓秦隴人還可以跟方　末伍的押韻就是了！化神奇爲臭腐，够多乾脆！（一九六頁）</p>
<p>切韻本身的定性分析，韻類彼此的關聯，一向沒人澈底整理過。著者用定性的硏究求出來：侵蒸和眞元音相同（五六），仙韻上古元音不能作Ｘ（二二一頁），都是好例，以後硏究的人還可以多加利用。</p>
<p>照評者個人看起來，著者的意見還有幾處留着將來討論的餘地。第一：晚周人的方言裏也許已經把-d-g丟了。要是肯承認這個見解的話，原書一〇二，一五一，二四五頁的討論就可以省好些個勁。</p>
<p>第二，著者認爲上古跟六朝的入聲都是塞而不裂聲（一三三頁），可是周秦人入聲跟陽聲通轉，而六朝人陽人並不押韵，這個現象，著者並沒有解釋。</p>
<p>第三，著者認爲上古有第五聲，大體可信。不過認爲收舌音的第五聲跟平上去的關係，和收舌根音的第五聲跟平上去的關係不一樣，純粹是個調形的問題（二〇〇頁），就有點兒危險。因爲那麼一來，先得似定平上去三聲本身極像，所以跟第五聲和入聲分得開，可同時本身又截然分成三類，不相混亂，這實在太難肯定，似乎還得從長計較。這幾點隨便抓住一個，都是將來討論的好題目。</p>
<p>最後，著者對於重出二等韻删山咸銜的無音分配，是照諧聲遠近定的。咸删因爲跟談寒近，所以是a（三六，四〇頁）。可是庚耕兩韻比起來，還是庚和唐近，反倒訂成耕a庚a（四五），似乎前後不一致了。著者也沒說明。</p>
<p>著者對於高的修正，確實比　進步得多。尤其是上古音裏沒五種og，讓人心裏鬆快點兒。可是　兩家的上古音看看，還跟現在任何活語言的音系不像。</p>
<p>不過這都是受材料的限制。著者所定的元音，幽部的w，宵部的Ａ，都是由週園幾部給限制出來的，所謂「其持之有故，其言之成理」是也。大槪書本兒上的材料，可以說已經讓著者利用凈了。書本兒上的材料，可以拿他求「類」，難拿他求「値」。比方像英語的Vowel　Shft，類完全沒動，値一個不變的也沒有。所以著者和高的上古音都跟切韻音差不多，也正是這個綠故。以後的人，想再求進步，就該上方言跟藏台語裏找出路去了。</p>
<p>要念過本見　，最好先拿切韻考韻鏡跟高書第一卷第三章對校，再念高書第三卷，再看江有誥的書，再念漢語詞類的叙論，然後再念本書，可以省老大事，也不過一兩個月就可以完工。這裏頭一點兒玄妙也沒有。無非有人忽略這　備工夫，就說本書難懂了。</p>
<h3>一九三九年來的英國散文</h3>
<p>— 邵洵美</p>
<p>Proce　Literature　Since　1939．By</p>
<p>John　Hayward．</p>
<p>The　British　Council．1947．53．pp</p>
<p>New　Writing，No．29．Eoited　by</p>
<p>John　Lehmann．</p>
<p>Penguin　Books　Ltd．186　pp．</p>
<p>英國人的特性是透澈，沉着，有計劃，有毅力，愛傳統，與善於應付艱難的環境。在第二次大戰中，又有了顯著的表現；即在其戰時的文壇裏，也可以找到强有力的證據。</p>
<p>「英協」主持的出版物不少。爲他們本國人去了解有關國家的情况，受人稱揚的有「牛津世界事實小叢書」；爲外國人去了解英國的，有「圖畫中的英國叢書」；完全關於文學藝術的，有「英國藝術選書」。</p>
<p>最後一種　書，已經出版的有十本左右。那是把各種藝術，分門別類，由著名作者或每一部門的專家來撰述。除了「蘇格蘭藝術」，「威爾士的聲音」，與「英國的建築」，此外幾種，如舞蹈，詩歌，小說，電影，岡畫，音樂，戲劇，每本的題目，都冠以「一九三九年以來」的字樣。所以內容的範圍，僅限於戰爭發生至戰爭結束，這五六年中的事實情况。</p>
<p>最近我們讀到的是「一九三九年以來的散文」。作者約翰，海華德，是著名的文學批評家，戰爭期間他在英國情報部，祖任新書介紹的工作，對於當時的文壇，當然比別人熟悉；所以由他來寫作這本書的確很適宜。本書內容包括傳記，評論，研究與記事文等。小說的範圍太廣，數量也太多，因此由亨利·李德另著『一九三九年以來的小說』單獨出版，本書內便難得提及了。</p>
<p>全書共七章。第一章是序文。短短的九頁文字，竟把戰爭時期文人和出版事業的槪况，叙述得很淸楚。甚至當時思想上的變動，今後可能的趨向，也有相當的分析。我早就說過，透澈，沉着，有計劃，善於應付環境，也是英國人的特性；所以戰事開始，全國動員，著名的文人與學奢，都被徵用。大家覺得，這一次的戰爭，是公理與强權，人道與野心的最後決定——是一種槪念的確認：因此宣傳攻守有同樣的重要。這些文人學者，有的在情報部或公家的文化組織服務，直接使用他們慣熟的工具。有的也參加後方的防禦工作。實際上前綫的便很少。</p>
<p>但是，這個並不是說。他們便可以有充分時間與安閒，去從事他們原來的寫作。一方面他們都有指定的公務；方面收集材料甚困難，整理思緒更不容易。所以除非是早已有了相當的準備，否則便祗能寫些簡短東西，偶然的靈感或片段的思想，交給雜誌報紙去發表。純粹的文學雜誌如「水平綫」，Horizon與」新寫作」New　Writing是最受人重視的兩種刋物。他們和大陸保持着智識的聯繫。前者儘量介紹法國的作品，後者更着重在中歐與巴爾幹諸國家，新作品的移譯。英國文藝，本來隨時靠大陸的源泉來培養，不斷地接受着新生命的灌輸。這一個傳統的責任，由他們肩負起來了，最近收到的是二十九期，譯登着有法國波蘭與捷克的詩與散文。還有一篇是英法畫家的比較硏究。最重要的有愛略脫新詩「四個四部合秦曲」的分析論文，爲本國讀者與外國讀者，去了解愛略脫的詩，是一個極大的帮助。從這裏，我們可以看得出，在戰爭期中，牠是一個如何不可缺少的文化媒介。</p>
<p>還有一種使著作界受到影響的，是紙張的限制與配給。尤其是戰前已經成立的出版家，他們受到的約東更嚴厲。紙張的供給旣少，他們出版　籍便也不得不經過鄭軍的考慮。故典作品的重印，與現代名作家作品的出版，須有適當的分配。可是讀者的人數却一天天在增加。他們在家的時間多了；外面娛樂的塲所也减少了；從電影與無綫電播音，所獲得的滿足，又不像書本一般深長；所以書籍的需要，便遠超過出版界所能供給的數量。在這種艱難的環境裏，居然還有若干新進作家與世人見面，我們不得不感佩出版家的能力與苦心。</p>
<p>第二章至第六章，是以散文的性質，分門別類來評述。當然這本書應當偏重在文藝與學術方面；可是歷史，政治，宗敎，哲學，科學，凡能影響思想的形成的著作，都有精確的論斷與簡明的介紹。</p>
<p>散文著作裏，以傳記與自傳最受歡迎。分析起來，不外是他們愛傳統的特性表現；與大部份的讀者，可以從戰爭的鐵腕裘，暫時逃避出來，偸尋一些安閒。他們可以憧悵於過去快樂與富麗的世界。假使是貧窮與恐怖的歷史，那麽，他們也可以借此安慰自己，說這個世界本來是痛苦的；更鼓勵自己，也應當像我們的祖先一般，有　氣與毅力來忍受與奮鬥。</p>
<p>科學的發明，與原子彈的應用，當然使人們的宗敎信仰受到影響。不過也有許多事實，是唯物的理論所不能解釋的，宇宙間的確有一個超人的意志存在着。哲學家文學家便繼續向宗敎裏去尋求眞理。詩人愛略脫，依　擁護着最」格的天主敎，指出一般的錯誤，將宗敎作爲是肉體的福利，在精神世界裏延長的要求。小說家黑胥里，躱到好萊塢遠郊，去研究密宗敎諦，竟然在小山上講道，有所謂新婆羅主義的提倡。</p>
<p>最後一章是結論，指出文藝界的危機。因爲電影與無綫電播音的經濟力量，會鼓勵通俗與低級趣味的作品；高深的學術探求會隨着一般需要而减少，或者退進一種狹小的圈子裏。這本來是全世界普遍的文化危機，我們也正可以借作殷鑑。</p>
<h3>寫在〔美術年鑑〕出版之前</h3>
<p>— 蔣錫頣</p>
<p>上海美術茶會編印　四月中出版</p>
<p>五十年來的中國，始終是處於多事之秋，而美術是民族文化與生命活躍的反映，其地位之重要，實不容忽視，政府一向是忙於救國，忙於治安，忙於民生，對於藝術好在不是當務之急，同時又好像與福利無關，向來聽其自然，可有可無，社會上大多數沈泯於貨利，對於精神問題，自有他們的見解，美術品在一般的眼光中不過是一種點綴，甚至是奢侈品，這負有幾千年歷史的中國美術的命運，幾乎令人不堪設想，記得蔡孑民先生首先倡導美育，在民國十八年舉行過第一次全國美衛展覽以後，到廿六年南京國立美術館的成立，及戲劇院音樂院的次第落成，教育部接着辦了第二次全面美展，出了一部專集，直至現在從沒有人提起過美術年鑑這件事，聽一位朋友說，很早黄賓虹先生很有編美術年鑑的動機，但後來也沒有實現，有人說中國美術界沒有一本年鑑眞是恥辱！幷且也是國家的恥辱！果眞這樣，辦美術年鑑到實在不容易了，如果編得不好，豈不是恥上加恥辱上再辱？但做一件事能知其難而不退似乎是應有的態度，否則難做的永遠沒有人去做，豈不永遠沒有成功的一日了？是恥是辱似乎應該是另外一件事才對。</p>
<p>遠　希臘·印度，歐美·日本那種看重美術的精神，且全部有年鑑之類的東西經常出版，其溝通文化，發揚國粹，在國際文化交流的地位上與價値實在是不可否認，而中國缺少這類東西，確也是事實，民國卅餘年以來在歷史上是短短的過程，我們原不能在這極短的過程上對美術存着過份的奢望，但卅餘年來美術作品的成就却也未可厚非，上海爲一國經濟文化之中心，人文薈萃，單祗美術團體而言，就有好幾個，如中國畫會，　人協會，女子書畫會，美術茶會，以及中央文化運動委員會所創立的美術協會，其中以美術茶會，成立爲時最暫，而擁有會員最多，約二千餘人，雖不都是美術家，而爲愛好美術者却是事實，加之近來美術界事業發展之速，情况之熱烈實呈前所未有之現象，種種美術作品的展覽連續不斷的舉行，如果沒有整個有系統的紀錄，非但時代久了以後堙歿無徵，即國內外欲明瞭中國美術情形者亦不可得，美術年鑑之編行確乎是必要的了！</p>
<p>以前爲什麼沒有人來辦這件事？恕我不詳之外，眼前這種動盪不定，生活艱困，民生凋蔽的局勢之下，美術茶會能毅然決然的來幹這件事，不僅使美術界感覺到莫大的興奮，即全國文化界也不免投以驚奇的一瞥，經濟與物質條件的束縛，以及預料之中或意想不到的困難發生，使人知道這確是一件不易討的工作，好在一方面張道藩，潘公展，和虞文幾位先生的提倡和鼓勵，另一方面美術茶會總幹事王　昌君，能一秉其不顧一切任勞任怨埋頭苦幹的精神，日以繼夜的工作，從籌備迄今，短短三四個月以來，能得到全國廿餘美術團體一致的響應，甚至遠在菲律濱的都來參加，其工作的努力與否由此可窺了，該編的內容包括有</p>
<p>五十年以來美術團體興革的珍責史料。</p>
<p>卅六年的各地藝術運動紀錄。</p>
<p>各地美術團體活動情形。</p>
<p>各地美術學校的美術運動。</p>
<p>卅六年全國各地畫展紀錄。</p>
<p>各地美術家活動情形。全國各美術家作品的介紹分：金石，書法，國畫，西畫，彫塑，木刻，攝影，圖案等部門，其中美術家傳略約八百篇，銅圖一千數百方，論文卅餘篇，洋洋數十萬言，巍爲大觀，該編的實質，我想待出版之後自有專家來評論，（該　約四月廿五日以前出版，現在預約中）至於量的方面，在這種環境之下也就可觀了，爲了三十六年美術年鑑是我國第一部美術年鑑，所以樂爲介紹，其有助於美術敎育，及國家的文獻其意義之深遠實毌庸贅言，</p>
<p>今天適逢美術節，本刋特選蔣錫頤君介紹美術茶會主編最近即將出版之美術年鑑，和溫肇桐先生介紹歷代論畫名著彙編兩文，聊表我們紀念本年美術節的微意。—編者</p>
<h3>歷代論畫名著彙編</h3>
<p>— 溫肇桐</p>
<p>沈子丞編　世界書局印行</p>
<p>吾國畫論，浩如烟海，神州國光社輯「美術　書」，採入甚富，抗戰以前，友人傳抱石先生撰「中國繪畫理論」一册，分列意境，神韻，樹石，皴法…諸章，採自莊周以迄于晚淸諸家畫論，按章摘錄若干條，註以出處，偶加註釋，由商務刋行，惟前者卷　冗繁，購讀不易，後者雖語語精義，但讀者也不能窺諸名論　全豹也。</p>
<p>「歷代論畫名著彙編」一書，它已經克服了這種困難，使得每一個讀者，可以從東晋顧愷之以來的許多重要畫論，一一都能看到，雖然有幾個名家，如唐張彥遠，淸惲格的作品，只錄其與書法有特殊關係者，如唐李嗣眞的「續畫品錄」，僧彥悰的「後畫錄」，淸盛大士「溪山臥遊錄」等未曾摘入，但一讀此書，已可獲得中國繪畫理論的整個概念了。</p>
<p>本書所輯歷代畫論名著，計七十五個名家，三百三十四卷畫論，茲依時年爲次錄之：</p>
<p>（一）晋顧愷之：「畫評」，「魏晋勝流書贊」，「畫雲臺山記」。</p>
<p>（二）南北朝，宗炳：「畫山水序」，王微：「叙畫」，謝赫：「古畫品錄」，梁元帝：「山水松石格」，姚最：「續古畫品錄」。</p>
<p>（三）唐，王維：「山水訣」，「水山論」，張彥遠：「論畫」</p>
<p>（四）五代，荆浩：「書說」，「筆法記」，「山水訣」。</p>
<p>（五）宋，李成：「山水訣」，董羽：「畫龍輯要」，郭熙：「林泉高致」，郭思：「畫論」，蘇軾：「東坡集」，米芾：「畫史」，羅大經：「畫說」，華光：「華光梅譜」，鄧椿：「畫繼」，「論界書法度綳尺」，韓拙：「山水純全集」，董遉：「廣川畫跋」。</p>
<p>（六）元，李銜：「息齋竹譜」，管道昇：「墨竹譜」，黄公望：「論山水樹石」，李澄叟：「畫說」，陶宗儀：「輟耕錄」等</p>
<p>（七）明，莫是龍：「畫說」，茅一相：「繪妙」，唐志契：「志契論畫」，唐寅：「論畫用筆用墨」，屠隆：「屠隆論畫」等</p>
<p>（八）淸，王時敏：「西廬畫跋」，王鑑：「染香庵跋畫」，等</p>
<p>每書每一時代之首，由編者撰一本時代的繪畫槪述，俾可使讀者先作一時代畫風的認識，每一名家之前，又列小傳一則，詳其姓氏，敍其爵里，考其師承，述其影響，此更可使讀者對一家有明確之認識。董其昌云：「讀萬卷書，行萬里路，胸中脫去　濁，自然邱　內營，立成鄞鄂，隨手寫出，皆爲山水傳神」。此爲吾國畫家所崇奉的金科玉律，本書雖不是「萬卷」，然亦可抵於萬一，吾願畫家或美術硏究者都拿它來一讀。</p>
<h3>讀〔畫家之死〕後</h3>
<p>— 紀平</p>
<p>眞正幽默的作品，確實是呌人含着淚笑的，笑得蒼凉，笑得哀傷。</p>
<p>馬克·吐溫在畫家之死裏寫着：</p>
<p>安徒生童話中有一段故事，我簡直記不起來了。我只記得大略是這樣，有一個小孩子喂了一隻小鳥。小孩子雖很愛這鳥，可是有時一不注意，便忘記去照顧它。小鳥也不受他的稱贊，也不受他的愛護，每天都盡量歌唱着。但是漸漸受飢渴的逼迫，他的歌聲，也就變成如泣如訴，終於有一大停止—原來這小鳥已經死了。這回小孩子跑來看見，懊悔無及。於是約集了朋友　，在悲嘆之中，替這鳥兒盡心竭誠營葬。其實，把詩人餓死了之後，才拿本來可以使他安樂過一生的金錢，來替他營葬，立紀念碑，這種矛盾，原不僅是小孩子爲然，誰也不曾注意到。……」</p>
<p>他這篇畫家之死的小說就是極其生動，極其深刻地繪露出：所有的天才，所有的天才藝術家在這個人世間所遭受的境遇。那幾乎是命定的境遇。貧窮，饑饉，然而依舊致力於藝術，在貧苦中繼續創造，而且保持着精神上的快樂。漸漸地，感到了無法支持的緊迫，精神，畢竟不能充饑，而他們精心創作的藝術品因爲尙未成名，雖然以極廉價目出售，也沒有人要。一般人，一般自命爲藝術鑑賞家往往是偶像崇拜者，他們決不是由於眞正的了解某件藝術作品的眞正的價値而予以贊美，而予以批評。對於一些尙未成名而確實眞正致力於創造的藝術人才常常是忽略，輕視，甚至踐踏馬克·吐溫自己是一們天才的藝術家，他深刻地了解一個藝術家的悲哀，因此，用幽默的筆調以法國畫家的故事，生動地寫出了千萬個從事藝術工作者的悲哀。自然，他更揭剖了這個社會的虛榮，愚　。所有的人都是偶像崇拜者。那實在是使淸醒者啼笑皆非的故事：</p>
<p>是一個春天，作者在孟德拉地方小住，遇見一個表現得不同於一般的「富人」史密斯先生，他曾是從事於藝術工作的畫家，據他自己說：少年時候，有兩個好友，也是畫家，一個呌弗烈爾，一個呌布蘭傑，一同在法國的鄉間作畫，他們雖然畫得確有長處，無奈都是無名小卒，誰也瞧不起他們的作品，日子久了，連一點最最便宜的蔬菜也無法得到，當他們實在感到艱困得無法支特的時候，來了一位救星，米勒，他也是未曾享有大名的畫家，因此，力量有限，隔不了多少日子，四個人被饑餓壓倒了</p>
<p>除了挨餓待斃以外，幾乎是找不到第二條路了，即便是拿一幅畫去換一棵白菜，也沒有人願要。馬克·吐溫在這裏寫盡了世上所有藝術家底遭遇的悽慘。</p>
<p>活着是每個人都有的要求，也是最最起碼的要求，在苦難旣臨的時候，求生的方法便被逼出來了：那就是布蘭傑提議：四個人一同抽籤，誰抽中了，誰死，因爲死了以後的畫，馬上就會身價萬倍，自然，在事先，還要大加宣傳，使抽中了的那個朋友努力創作，即便是只畫幾筆也可以，主要是有他底落款，而且簽名要簽得非常特別，使人一望便知是他的筆跡。</p>
<p>起初，大家都驚愕，以爲他瘋了，之後，聽說抽中的人裝死，不過是隱居起來，並不眞的死去，才博得大家的狂喜。</p>
<p>結果，米勒抽中了，他負責製造作品，其餘三個人分途宣傳，說：大畫家米勒病重，恐怕不久於人世了，而且設法使各家報紙登載米勒的病情，這樣進行了幾個禮拜，居然大有收效，他們隨身携帶的米勒的作品，竟全部售出了；而且價錢一次比一次增高。</p>
<p>終於大畫家米勒病故的消息傳出來了，簡直是舉世震悼，喪禮，自然是盛大的，爲了免去外人的疑懼，因爲棺材裏裝的是臘製的人型，也表示他們的尊敬，棺材是由四個人抬的，四個人，其中自然也有米勒一份。就這樣，一代大畫家被千萬人哀葬在郊外了。從此以後，米勒的作品成了珍寳，多少富人搶着購買。因此，他們四個，曾經被生活逼上絕路的眞正的畫家。不但免於溝緊，更擁有龐大的財寳而成了富翁。</p>
<p>是的——</p>
<p>「你吃驚了吧！」馬克·吐溫在最後這樣說：「也不怪你，只有這一次，世間不把天才餓死，而把他應得的報酬送與別人。只有這一隻小鳥，並不受那種冷酷的待遇——在生時一點也不受喝彩地盡量歌唱到死，死後才受盛大的營葬那種冷酷的待遇。」</p>
<p>「因爲我們盡了『全力』，不讓他這麽受的。」</p>
<p>這裏面藏有多少深重的悲哀！作者以淸勁而幽默的筆調爲我們鈎出了眞正的社會世態。</p>
<p>在今天，在廿世紀五十年代的今天，這樣的情境依然存在。</p>
<p>活着的受盡苦難；死去的，飽享敬愛。</p>
<p>那樣的日子，也許總有一天會來，　家用不着再以「死」來求「活」；所有努力於藝術工作的藝術家，再不會如小鳥似的，受到那種冷酷的待遇。</p>

<p>自由談</p>
<h3>我亦談吃</h3>
<p>— 陳詒先</p>
<p>近在自由談上，看到爾篇談吃的文字，極有趣味，我再來補充這一篇。</p>
<p>首先，我以爲講究吃，並非老婆，此事實在有關於民族健康問題，朱可厚非。孟子言：「食色性也」。可見食是人生第一件事，無論中外古今，凡是革命，改朝換代，都是因為人民吃飯問題而起。</p>
<p>中國人對於吃，但考究滋味，中國人只講營養。自由談上白永先生的一篇「吃」言從前河工上官員吃鵝掌，要烙死許多隻鵝，吃猴腦，要將枷架在活猴頸上，送到席前，敲破腦蓋，賓客以匙取食，此種方式，眞太殘忍，並無多大的營養價値。我以爲我們現在要硏究的，是將滋味營養兩問題，聯合為一，且須不多花錢。稍微知道營養學的人，都知道食物中有維他命ABC等質，不知道食物中尚有一種最要的份子，名爲色铔基酸（Tryhtophan），豆類菜如豇豆豌豆，綠葉菜中如莧菜等都有，而魚翅鮑魚等貴菜反無之。</p>
<p>每一國人，有其民族習慣，不必亦不可隨便改動，吃也是其中的一種。我有一學生，去年往美國讀書，來信言：「船上菜旣豐且好，但是接連吃一星期，就發生厭惡，十分想吃稀飯鹹菜。」中國人體質不如西人之强，世人每怪吃米飯不如麵包之養人，而自由談國平先生的一篇「米能治病」則言：美國開普納博士曾發表於報章上面說過，「數千年來中國人的食物—米—的確能治高血壓，假如你身體中是有一碗飯，而不是一杯牛奶或一塊牛排，那你能免於患高血壓而增長生命。蓋肉類或脂肪的食物多吃後，含有患高血壓的可能，而米則是少蛋白質和鹽的食物。」觀此，可見米是中國數千年來的食物，的確大有用處，而牛奶並不合於大多數人民的民族習慣，一班人舉洋派，吃西餐，並不見得是好事。</p>
<p>西人的盛大宴會，有各種各樣的酒，飯前有開胃酒，飯後有消食酒，吃湯有吃湯的酒，吃魚有吃魚的酒，吃牛排有牛排的酒，吃鷄有吃鷄的酒，各各不同，眞是洋洋大觀。不過外國酒雖好，菜實在不高明，因之雖有好酒，也爲之减色。中國的一席菜，酒的種類雖不多，然而頂好的黄酒，並不比香檳「推板」，茅台大　，也與白蘭地同一有香味。論到菜，則中國吃酒有吃酒的菜，吃飯有吃飯的菜，吃粥有吃粥的菜，眞非西餐可比，今引紅樓夢上兩段說明之。</p>
<p>寳玉黛玉兩人到了薛姨媽處，「寳玉誇前日那邊府裏珍大嫂子的鵝掌鴨信，薛姨媽連忙搬出自已糟的與他嗜，寳玉笑道，這要有酒方好。」這是酒菜。「賈母吃野鷄崽子湯，言：若是還有生的，再炸上兩塊，鹹浸浸的，吃粥有味兒，那湯雖好，就是不對稀飯。」這是粥菜與飯菜不同的地方。</p>
<p>現在米珠嶄桂，生活不易，我們對於吃，當然不能考究到吃野鷄崽子湯，糟鵝掌鴨信，然而經濟不十分爲難的人，略爲考究口味，並不甚費，也是人生的一種享受。除開酒席不談，家常便飯菜，我以爲應有五個字，以爲標準，即湯，滷，炒，靑，醃。湯與炒，人人皆知，滷是紅燒的菜，如紅煮魚，如紅燉肉，菜裏有滷，可以淘飯；肖是靑菜，一切綠葉菜瓜類豆類根類菜皆屬之，醃是指冬醃菜，腐乳，醬菜之類。有此五六樣菜，所費不多，而酒菜，飯菜，粥菜都有了。</p>
<p>故都有一恩成居小館子，在陜西巷，雅座只有兩小間，外面散座也不多，全部坐滿，不過容納二三十人，但是有一樣名菜，又是極平常的菜—洋葱牛肉絲，門口常有汽車停住，闊人來吃的很多。其牛肉絲，是用裏脊肉，横切，用重油，在大火上炒幾下，加洋葱作料即得。故都又有一吃羊肉饀餅的店，在煤市街，因爲餅好，老板姓周，有「餡餅周」之名。牛肉羊肉皆爲尋常食物，廚子做得好，就可以將滋味營養兩問題，聯合爲一。凡此種種，正式歷史中似乎均不曾見到，僅僅作爲茶餘酒后的談資。同時，我們山國那次也分潤了戰勝國的光榮，中國鈔票在德國大走紅運，所以也就提高了我們的民族地位，因而我們價格外容易記得那些建設在別人苦痛之上的笑話。法國名記者草洛在「巴黎之陷落」一書中，似曾說到一九一七年以後德意志人民道德之墮落，爲了一塊美金的小賬，可以丟盡”耳曼民族的臉面，可見所謂節操與康恥云云，其基礎乃是鈔票與糧食。此次德國雖是戰敗國，馬克却未如上次的崩潰，而我們的責東鄰，却更以戰敗者的鷺駑笑，脾睨着這戰勝者，吾人溫習了「德國的命運」，誠有不忍言者矣！</p>
<h3>俗語有典</h3>
<p>— 盡緣</p>
<p>今仳社會上流行俗語，似極普通，細考之皆有古典可證。如「客氣」出左傳定公八年；「荒唐」出莊子；「多謝」出漢書李廣傳；「打算」出元史劉秉忠傳；「不中用」出史記；「着力」出南齊書；「勿認眞」出元史王克敬傳；「豈有此理」乃司馬光語；「插嘴」出五燈會元；「呵呵大笑」「搖頭擺尾」均見傳燈錄；「嘈雜」出抱朴子；「談何容易」出漢書東方朔傳；「本錢」出漢書食貨志；「不耐煩」出朱書庾登之傳；「七顚八倒」出朱子語類；「三翻四覆」乃宋眞空寺老僧語；一打扮」出黄公紹詩；「罷休」出史記；「措大」出「全唐詩話」；「脚色」出朝野類要；「毛病」出山谷集；「留神」出東方朔傳；「撞舉」出白香山詩；「便宜」出南齊書顧憲之疏；「對手」出舊唐書；「朝裏無人莫做賓」見元人歸隱詞。雖曰里巷言詞，亦可知無一字無出典來歷也。</p>
<h3>量珠小記</h3>
<p>— 季用</p>
<p>先抄一段書：明白愚「汴圍濕襟錄」第三圍，「一馬千金」條以下云二「糧草久絕，戰馬無用，各軍缺食，撫軍下令，馬聽軍官宰殺充餉。兵殺一馬，雜以人肉，每斤賣銀，價至數兩，一馬可値千金。古語云，賣狗懸羊，今見賣人懸馬矣！民間一粒如珠，官兵尙有餘糧，皆括之大戶之家，鄉紳巨室覓買，但得粟而不計價，升粟賣至萬錢。有珠客携珠易米，碎小渚推棄於地而不視，間落一米，留意檢起，米貴於珠，果經見之。糧盡之日，家家閉戶，甘心待斃，白建行人斷絕，遇有僻巷孤行，多被在家强壯者拉而殺之，分肉而啖，亦無人覓。間有鳴官，亦不暇爲理。雖出示禁拿，亦不勝其禁也。甚有夜間合夥入室，暗殺其人，竊肉以歸。居民慮不自保，先將婢僕自殺而啖。尤不忍聞者，父食其子，天地寃慘，日月爲昏！糧盡矣，强兵唯以殺人爲食，僻街小巷之民，皆團聚大市而居，互相爲衛。不唯剜尸以炊，亦且析屋而燒，畫棟雕梁，頓成破壁。人家烟絕灶冷，飛鳥遠颺絕迹，昔睢陽猶有雀可羅，鼠可掘，今則雀鼠盡無，往史未見。官兵因糧盡，假借偸營，投賊不回；亦有將採菜難民乘無人殺死，割級報功岡賞。恐家屬識認像貌，復將面上加砍數刀，以變其形。天曉携級入城，獻功一級。常隨百人搶買，價至數兩，兵忍民寃，古今罕見！……」</p>
<p>這是晚明中原人民一頁血淚史，較之記張獻忠的「蜀碧」實亦有過之無不及。我時時懷疑人類的理性究竟有多少，而且到什麽限度爲止，如今很簡單的得到證明，即是到沒有吃的餓了肚皮爲止。我們看三百年前的開封城，闊人量珠買米，那時候不見得通貨膨脹也如今日，而人民亦不信任金錢者，金錢如果喪失了他的代價作用，本無使用價値之可言也！這個不知能否打動今日專囤金鈔股票的紳士們。中國百姓一似自來只有被人吃肉的資格，從納稅到被兵士殺了頭，把肉賣銀子，全是一樣。趙甌北廿二史剳記「書前後米價貴賤之數」條也說：「貞觀時，斗米三錢，玄宗東封泰山之歲，東郡米斗十錢，靑齊米斗五錢。自安史之亂，兵役不息，田土荒蕪，兼有攤戶之弊，……十家之內，五家逃亡，即令未逃之五家，均攤其稅。如石投井，不到底不止。是以逃亡愈多，耕種愈少。代宗永泰元年，京師米斗一千四百，畿甸按穗以供宮廚，至麥熟後，市有醉人，已詫爲祥瑞。較貞觀開元時，幾至數十百倍，讀史者於此可見觀世變也。至如攻戰之地，城圍糧絕，尤有不可以常理論者，魯靈守南陽，賊將武令珣，田承嗣等攻之累月，米斗至四五十千，有價無米，一鼠値錢四百。安慶緒被圍於相州，斗米錢七萬。黄巢據長安，百姓遁入山砦，累年廢耕耘，賊坐守空城，穀價湧貴，斗米三十千，官軍皆執山砦民賣於賊爲食，一人値數十萬。楊行密圍揚州，城中草根，木實，皮囊，革帶俱盡，外軍掠人來賣，人五十千，張雄有軍糧，相約交易，金一斤，通屬帶一條，得米五升。」</p>
<p>百姓之倒霉，豈不與明代如出一轍？旣是官兵與賊兵都要吃百姓，而且很合作，不知這戰爭還有什麼意義！昔讀杜老羗村詩，有「莫辭酒味薄，黍地無人耕，兵戈尙未息，兒童盡東征。」已覺其滿紙凄然，但若與此相比，那到底還是天堂。幼年讀左傳，華元與子反的故事，尤不相信，什麽易子而食之，析骸而炊之，鄭國雖是小國，何至如此！豈知文章誇大，原有極限，這種話却並不是亂扯的。譬如此刻現在，米價之匪夷所思，即使活在此時此地之人，都感到不大相信，歷史家怎樣寫得使後日的人不致以他爲胡說，我委實想不出。第一次歐洲大戰後，德國馬克的舊話，我們方且笑其荒唐，有一友人那時遊歐，據云到餐館進餐，普通均以鷄蛋計算，因按馬克計，實有不勝其煩者，如吃啤酒，第二杯之價，可能與第一杯不同，有一老太太賣了自己的住宅，得馬克數十億，心頗欣然，不料一星期後，其錢只能買一鷄蛋，</p>
<h3>貓頭鷹</h3>
<p>— 何島</p>
<p>我國有公冶長懂鳥語之說，却不料西洋古時也有人專從鳥類的行動和鳴聲來預卜吉凶的，西人稱這種「學問」爲「占鳥學」（Ornithomancy），與「鍊金術」正好遙遙相對，可說是無獨有偶。但我們一向以聞梟鳴爲不祥，而在西洋則並不盡然。</p>
<p>譬如說，古代希臘人就對貓頭鷹表示極大的敬意。在薩拉密斯大戰中，希臘海軍統帥的旗艦桅竿上突然來了一隻貓頭鷹，軍心頓時大振，認爲勝算可操，結果果然打了一個大勝仗。近代鳥類學家認爲貓頭鷹實在是一種極笨拙的鳥類，但在二千年前的希臘哲人們却以貓頭鷹爲智憲的象徵。</p>
<p>羅馬人却不然了，他們說貓頭鷹是專門吮嘬小孩的血液的，祗要屋頂上來了一貓頭鷹，這一家便一定有人死亡。有一天，羅馬人最崇信的周必得神廟的屋宇上竟發現了一隻貓頭鷹，全城的祭師卜者等等大驚失色，急將那只貓頭鷹捉住了活活燒死，將尸灰散在蒂伯河裏。祭師們一面喃喃誦經，一面趕快把全城薰香，算是讓解災厄。</p>
<p>當然，用近代人的眼光看起來，這種舉動簡直愚昧可笑。鳥類學者把貓頭鷹看作一種平凡的禽鳥，而歐美各國，竟已有許多人專門飼養了不少貓頭鷹作爲消遣的，正如有許多人喜歡養狗養貓一樣。據科學家統計，貓頭鷹的種類達三百種以上，在北極冰天雪地中，在熱帶的叢纂密林中，都有貓頭應的踪跡。科學家爲甚麽嫌貓頭鷹笨拙呢？是因爲牠的眼睛祗會向前直視，不能自由轉動之故。如果牠要看左右的東西，便非把頭頸向左右儘力扭轉不可。不過牠也有一樣絕技，就是當牠明明向前站着的時候，如果後面有人掩上去，牠會得身軀並不移動而突然扭轉兩隻脚趾，把利爪對準了身後的人或別的動物刺進去。</p>
<p>貓頭鷹吃東西的本領頗堪驚人。牠們的食物包括兎子，烏龜，老鼠，小鳥，靑蛙，，魚，蟹，蚌蛤，各種昆虫，有時還要吃蜥蜴和蛇類。牠們有時啄掉一些不易下咽的羽毛之類，接着就把那些食品扯成幾大塊，吞下肚去。容易消化的東西就到了胃腸裏去，而鱗毛羽角之類吃不下去的東西，牠會留在嘴裏，摶在一起，一口吐出來，像一個圓球。</p>
<p>然而在有許多愛好貓頭鷹的人們看來，貓頭鷹實在並不討厭，豢養稍久之後，牠們也會聽了主人的使喚飛來飛去。人們已漸漸不以牠爲不吉之鳥，因爲「占鳥學」這門「學問」早已與羅馬帝國同時成爲歷史上的名詞了。</p>
<h3>米開朗琪洛的故事</h3>
<p>— 冷冷</p>
<p>意大利著名美術彫刻家米開朗琪洛正在彫刻某大理石像的一天，有一位親友拜訪他。見米開朗琪洛專心一致地手不離像工作着，預料沒有幾天就能完工。避免打擾工作，他就匆匆吿辭。</p>
<p>此後過了幾個月，他又來拜訪米開朗琪洛，看見和前回同樣的石像，出驚地嘲笑米開朗琪洛說：</p>
<p>「老兄，幾個月之前，我來拜訪過你，你正在努力不懈地工作着，我猜想沒有幾天就能完工，但是現在所看到的石像不是和以前一樣絲毫未改的站着嗎？」</p>
<p>米開朗琪洛回答說：</p>
<p>「那裏話，我沒有懶着不動手。在幾個月中我正在修飾這裏磨琢那裏，這邊的面孔弄他柔和，那邊的筋肉使他堅强。你看口唇這地方現在稍許使他有表情，這脚邊加入力量了。」這樣詳細地說明。</p>
<p>聽了這一番說話，他不禁格格地冷笑着：</p>
<p>「誠然，那些固然很好，可是老兄，那種不是太微細嗎？這樣小事也要如此費事，大作品怎樣能產生呢？」</p>
<p>於是米開朗琪洛用極莊嚴的態度回答說：</p>
<p>「或許像你所說不能產生大作品，可是，你要知道，大凡完全無缺的作品，都是由許多小的注意和小的工作相集而成。所以完成大事者，是細心的注意和努力。」</p>
<p>米開朗琪洛在藝術上的成功，實在起因於這裏。</p>
<h3>好名</h3>
<p>— 東華</p>
<p>世界上的名人大都好名自尊，就是華盛頓也未能免俗，他曾希望人民一致稱頌他的大名，恭維他是一個世界上最有權能的偉人。</p>

<h3>閒話名字</h3>
<p>— 陳左高</p>
<p>名字之別，遠在春秋時，已有論及者在。禮記檀弓篇云：「幼名，冠字。」疏復申其義曰：「始生三月而加名，故云幼名。年二十，有爲人父之道；朋友等類，不可復呼其名，故冠而加字。」由見人之　名，自古先於取字。相距歲月之久，亦且十數年。至名與字號之關係，除馮君木（幷）姻丈外，斟有提及。雖閎通如章太炎，於茲亦未加獨斷，僅曰：「名字者，一字之殊號；名不可二，孳乳最多謂之字」而已。（見國故論衡）</p>
<p>按丈係遜淸一代名儒，才華不覊，撰回風堂文，琢句謀篇，力逼魏晋。所言字號之別，更具灼兌。據云：「人之稱字，恒與其名息息相關；號則隨欲而稱，可遞增至於無盡期也。」徵諸實例，信然。如元代著輟耕錄之陶宗儀，字九成；蓋本諸虞書「簫韶九成，鳳皇來儀」之句。又撰十七史商榷之王鳴盛，字鳳喈，亦屬名字相聯，意義昭然。至稱號則異是。若釋道濟，別號達二十餘；其最著者，如瞎尊者，苦瓜和尙，石壽等。又沈子培，除乙庵寐叟常用之號外，更稱號數十，散見於各種遣墨上。雖乃子慈護先生，亦不得審其詳也。</p>
<p>先儒稱字，輒喜摭，用「伯」「仲」「叔」「季」「孔」「孟」「公」「子」諸字。試觀歷史上人物，若龍伯高孔仲尼羊叔子吳季札諸葛孔明陳孟公沈孟淵（名淵，明詩家）等，胥嵌斯數字在。次之，姓下凡寓類似庵（陳夔龍號庸庵）齊（端方號陶齊）等字者，則大柢係別號而非字</p>
<p>我國文士，每於中歲，輒喜易名。證諸晚近，亦莫不然。黨國先進中，如胡漢民之名發變，于右任之名伯循，邵力子之名聞泰，吳稚暉之名眺，章太炎之名絳，潘公展之名有猷，陳布雷之名訓恩，邵元沖之名冀如，曾養甫之名憲浩，余井塘之名愉，程天放之名學愉，劉蘆隱之名愼德，斯皆用於早歲，而見廢於今者也。此外，書畫家類是者，據余所知，亦大有人在，如張大千之名正權，馮超然之名迥，吳湖帆之名燕翼，陳巨來之名推，趙叔孺之名時綱，王福廠之名壽祺等皆是。</p>
<h3>成功之前</h3>
<p>— 毛毅</p>
<p>假如你對你自己和你的潛在的能力有信心的話，就應該鍛鍊你自己，培植你的潛能，而不可因失敗而自暴自棄，也不可因旁人的冷嘲熟諷而灰心。多少的成功者在出人頭地之前都會被人所訕笑或者蔑視，但是，爲了他們有信心，他們終於用成功答覆了訕笑與蔑視，請看看下面的幾個例子罷：</p>
<p>「小婦人」的作者魯意莎。梅·阿爾考德在她的同鄕的眼中是一個不辨菽麥，愚閣無知的頑皮女孩。有一次，有一個出版商甚至「忠吿」她放棄寫作的念頭。</p>
<p>美國的短篇小說作家眞尼。格雷在成名之前，想將他的一篇稿子賣給一個出版商，後者却說他毫無寫小說的能力，弄得格雷窘困不堪。</p>
<p>「藍色狂想曲」的作者喬治。葛許溫第一次顯身舞台，彈奏鋼琴的時候，他被笑下了台。笑他的人不僅是同台的演員而已，還有那台下的觀衆。</p>
<p>美國的「五分一角商店」，如今業務繁昌，分支店衆多，他的創辦人華爾瓦滋曾受僱於一家零售店，店裏的老闆認爲華爾瓦滋連招待顧客的營業感都沒有，所以賦他以司關的卑職，待遇是每天五毛錢。</p>
<p>再讓我們來看看那些成功以前的大科學家捫：</p>
<p>「無綫電之父」馬可尼在初次開始硏究無綫電的時候，首先遭受他的父親的嘲笑，說馬可尼在浪費時間。</p>
<p>愛因斯坦在求學時代被他的敎師們當作笨伯，就是他的父母也認爲自己的孩子不堪造就。</p>
<p>還有愛迪生，他在學校裏每逢考試，名次總是排在後面。敎師們呌他爲「蠢貨」，醫生們說他的腦子有毛病！</p>

<p>上帝也不輕易定人善惡，必需候至末日審判才能定識；我們人類相互間，又何必憑着一時性急而即定人是非呢？（約翰遜）</p>

<p>惟有妄自尊大　　他人的鄙夫，神亦爲之流涕太息。（莎士比亞）</p>
<p>有很多的人不能成爲思想家，　因他們的記性太好了，（納契嘉）</p>
<h3>善惡之間</h3>
<p>— 仲明</p>
<p>我們有時簡直無法辨別出一個人的善惡和一件事的好壞。常常聽到甲認爲丙這個人很好而乙認爲甲的看法完全錯誤的爭執，和甲乙兩人對於同一事件所引起的「是」與「非」，「善」與「惡」這種觀念不同的辯論。所以發生這種爭執和辯論的原因，無非因爲「善」與「惡」的界綫沒有劃分淸楚，而當今日生存問題已成爲普遍性威脅的時候，每個人都在求生的唯一條件之下追逐在「利」的後面，以求生命的持續，在這裏面所發生的「善」與「惡」的問題，往往就更給人一種混淆不淸的感覺了。</p>
<p>不過如果我們仔細地想一想，一件事情的好壞固然可以判斷，一個好人和一個壞人畢竟也還是分別得出來的。譬如說一個窮人因爲生活將瀕於絕境，不得已作了一次偸竊的行爲，照理說，我們所引起的同情應該多於呵責；反之，一個有錢的人雖然以自已的資本爭取利潤，可是如果他所用的手段是有害於大衆的話，那末我們仍舊是討厭他的。再說一般志在保持幣値，不得不在物價作直綫上升的局面下買進一些日用品的升斗小民，當然也加不得「囤積」和「剝削」這許多壞的字眼。我們讚美一個用勞力來換飯吃的農夫或是工人，而我們至少不能夠去稱頌一個游手好閒使田園荒蕪的佃農或是只以他人的勞力來維持假人享受的地主，至於一個已經吃飽了飯而在無事生端尋羅罷工之流，自然也該爲我們所唾棄。再說學生罷，一個愛國的學生是可愛的，而只喊愛國的口號，下肯用功讀書，以及一部分祇是在渾渾噩噩地過着，僅布望撈得一張文憑的學生，便不應該受到我們的贊美。說到戰爭，那末爲了正義的防衛而產生的抵抗，和對方蓄意侵略的野心相比較，其「善」「惡」之分野，更是顯而易見的。</p>
<p>人是趨向於「善」的一面的，一般講起來，除非不得已，人才會選擇罪惡的一面。可是以目前的情形來看，有許多並不是出於「不得已」的，却往往走入罪惡的道路；而正有許多面臨着「不得已」的，却並不願意就此跌入罪惡和黑暗的深淵，還在聲嘶力竭地掙扎着；從這一點看，我們不得不因此特別痛惜前者的墮入罪惡，和歌頌後者的接近光一明。</p>

<p>第十三章　力圖補救　（一〇八）</p>
<p>渚齊聽了她這句話，不由怔住，知道其中一定有文章，也不便再往下追問，很失意的說道：「你允許我以後可以再來嗎？」雲卿搖一搖頭道：「最好不必見面。」渚齊伸出手來說道：「你允許我握一握手嗎？」雲卿伸出手來，握住渚齊的手，渚齊覺得她的手冰冷的，有些抖動，知道她心裏受很大刺激，說地聲再見，抹頭下樓去了。走到馬路上，心裏難過極了，覺得二十多年的膩友，一旦絕交，是自己對不住她，還是她對不住我呢？這個謎必須打破，原能痛快。她旣然去問肖柏姑丈，現在只有上他家問地問便知道，不過肖柏姑丈的脾氣很不好，怎麽樣問他才好呢？難道自己和綺紈的事，他已經知道了嗎？他向來脾氣，不齊管別人的事，就是知道，我想也不會挑撥事非。一面想着，一面走，一直走到東單脾樓，才想起僱車，來到費宅。食拍正在家裏，躺在床上休息，一見渚齋進來，點點頭，招呼他在榻邊坐下，問道：「你好久沒來了，聽說綺紈走了？」渚齋見他一見面，便問起了綺紈，不由臉上一紅，還沒答應，接着又聽肖柏道：「從她走後，我很不放心，最近得着一個好消息，我心中可痛快。我聽說最近肖鶴接了她母親柳如的電報，呌把綺紈的行頭寄上海去，這樣看來，綺紈有重理梨園生涯的志向，現在梅先生還在上海，綺紈向來是以那梅派幾齣戲號召的，現在再有梅先生在上海親自指導，我想她在舞台上一定很順利的，她本很聰明，再肯努力，一定很有成就。她這回出去，可以說是由我發動，其中原因也不必說，也許你心裏會明白，我本怕她受了激刺會走入歧途，現在又回到梨園界，我可放心了。至於你，也幾乎走入迷途，我當時不便當面指點，暗中把你們兩個調開，當時我若要告訴你，你一定恨死我了—可是今日之下，你父母夫婦“都照樣沒有一點閒話，家庭很美滿的，不能不說是我的功勞，以後你好好努力吧！」</p>

<h3>同居十四年不知情郎是盜　女方恐遭連累呼籲救濟</h3>
<p>張珍問　女友某君，十四年前與某甲同居，生有子女各一。當時祗知其在外經商，至去年始悉某甲在外曾犯盜案，且一度入獄。最近更犯案累累，某女恐被連累擬與其脫離，茲有下列諸問題，擬請貴欄解答：（一）某女士現欲與某甲脫離同居關係，朱知法律上有何問題，手續如何？（二）某女士所生子女，可否帶走？（三）某女士赴警局吿發，唯恐將來遭其毒手。若不吿發，則某女士是否成立犯罪行爲？（四）若某女十私行出走，某甲可否干涉其行動？</p>
<p>〔法律顧問唐鳴時先生答〕（一）同居關係，雖爲時久長，如來問所稱有十四年；但不能以時久而取得夫妻身份。換言之，同居終是同居，並不以時間久暫而異其關係也。若問同居之法律上關係，即合則留，不合則去而已。脫離手續，上海往往登報公吿，其實登報，不過表示之一種耳。。子女監護之戰，除別有約定外。原應由男方任之。立法保護子女，以現代男性社會，能力較充裕故也。（參酌民法離婚例）但法院得爲其子女之利益，酌定蓋護人。例如男方作盜，爲子女着想，亦爲社會着想，官歸女方敎養。（三）夫婦得互相庇護不爲罪，蓋人情之常。惟同居關係，有合夥之嫌，吿發不爲失常。脫離同居，當可免累，惟不可携取贓物。（四）脫離同居，單方面亦可行之；在法理上，不能强迫同居。</p>

Furthermore, Fu Zuoyi conducted an aerial inspection of the Southern Chahar and Northern Yanbei battlefields at 11:00 AM on the 24th and flew back to Suiyuan to arrange military affairs.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 24th] The North China Bandit Suppression Headquarters released the battle situation in Southern Chahar and Northern Shanxi: (1) The city of Weixian was once infiltrated by bandits. The military and civilians of the city fought fiercely, having endured five days. The communist bandits continued to reinforce their forces, reaching 20,000 troops. They launched a fierce attack on the city at 4:00 AM on the 24th, concentrating various artillery pieces to bombard the southeast corner of the city. The intensity of the battle was unprecedented. A breach was blasted in the eastern city wall, and the bandits infiltrated through it, but they were repelled by the defending troops. (2) The defense war of Tianzhen County has begun, and fighting in the suburbs is very fierce. (3) The 6,000+ communist bandits who attempted to attack Yangyuan are still blocked in the Chuaigutun and Quandougou areas.

(5) The defenses of Datong city are solid, and there is no fighting in the surrounding areas.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 24th] The air force here continuously dispatched aircraft last night and this morning to aid the battles in Southern Chahar and Northern Shanxi. According to reconnaissance reports, there were no battles in Tianzhen on the 24th. Sources say that the main battles in Northern Shanxi and Southern Chahar are still brewing, and the National Army is seeking a suitable opportunity to launch a large-scale encirclement and suppression operation. It is also learned that artillery fire has been heard within Datong city. The airport is unharmed. The defending troops at the Zhou Sizhuang railway station have withdrawn to Datong. The communist bandit outposts have reached 14 li (approx. 4.7 miles) from the city suburbs, and the artillery fire has reached the Kouquan area west of the city.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 24th] The war in Northern Shanxi has spread to the Datong coal mine. The Yongdingzhuang and Tongjialiang mines, as well as the Yanling power plant, were lost on the morning of the 22nd.

The machinery was destroyed during the previous battle, and since then, primitive mining methods have been used, producing more than 500 tons of coal per day, with a total of 3,000 workers and over 200 staff members. There are over 10,000 tons of coal in storage. There were plans to rush the transportation of coal before the outbreak of the war.

<p>[Central News Agency, Zhangjiakou, 24th] As the communist bandits flee north, the entire Chahar province and the Zhangjiakou city area have entered a state of military emergency. People are enthusiastically joining the security police, and morale is high. According to Provincial Government Secretary-General Zeng Houzai, the province's military and government are working closely together with ample preparation. As early as days ago, Commander-in-Chief Fu had anticipated that the communist bandits would invade, so he immediately ordered the dispatch of cadres to various counties and townships to implement a scorched-earth policy. To date, the areas south of Zhuolu in Southern Chahar, west of Huaian and Wanquan, have completed the task. Shangyi, Shangdu, and other places in Northern Chahar are also in the process of implementation. Zeng continued, "Under the call of Commander-in-Chief Fu, the people of this province have long understood the meaning of 'people suppressing bandits' and 'suppressing bandits is more important than defending against bandits.' Now, local armed security police teams and others throughout the province have been established and have considerable strength. In addition to defending strongholds, they can also conduct guerrilla warfare, allowing the National Army stationed in various strongholds to be deployed freely and flexibly, which is tantamount to increasing unlimited strength." Finally, Zeng solemnly stated, "The security of this province is guaranteed, please wait patiently for the good news in the near future."</p>

<h3>After Arriving in Nanjing, Cheng Qian and Li Zongren to Be Summoned Separately by Chairman Today; Cheng Calls for US Military Aid to China</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 24th] Chairman Chiang has scheduled separate summonses for Cheng Qian and Li Zongren on the 25th for inquiries.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 24th] Cheng Qian received reporters at Jieshou Hall at 2:00 PM on the 24th and answered their questions extensively. Cheng first said that his election platform has been scattered in his published articles and written talks, so he did not want to reiterate it. He then described the general situation of bandit suppression in the Yu area in the past two years and the current military situation in Central China, and called for US military aid to China, saying that the current situation in the Northeast is serious because the equipment of the Chinese Communist Party is all new weapons and there is a backstage boss supplying them. If the communist bandits were only Chinese bandits, led only by Mao Zedong, we would not need US aid to eliminate them. Now that the communist bandits actually have their international backing, US military and economic aid is necessary. At the same time, China's industry should increase production, agriculture should give land to the tillers, and more should be done to ensure that land has tillers, to reform politics and achieve self-reliance. The day Cheng arrived in Nanjing, the 23rd, was exactly the 20th anniversary of his recapture of Nanjing. Someone asked him about the process at the reception, and Cheng also described it in detail.

Bandit casualties are piling up. As of the morning of the 24th, the bandits drove militia to charge at the risk of death. The National Army calmly responded to the battle and is still firmly defending Luochuan city walls and surrounding outposts, engaged in intense fighting with the bandits.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Xi'an, 24th] After a large number of National Army troops arrived in Shaanxi, the bandits' momentum was thwarted. The bandits under Wang Zhen, who were entrenched in Yijun and Huangling, had a portion of about 3,000 people fleeing to the area east of the Luochuan River and north of Chengcheng on the 23rd. Yesterday, the Third Column of bandits from Zhaocheng and Huoxian, about three brigades, also clamored to cross the Yellow River to infiltrate Shaanxi. A regiment of the bandit's Sanbian Garrison Brigade also fled from Huancheng in eastern Gansu to the area west of Qingyang, with the intention of restraining the National Army in Shaanxi from fiercely suppressing them.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Xi'an, 24th] Powerful National Army units have now begun to advance westward from the outskirts of Luoyang. The bandit troops in Western Henan were forced to flee westward. Their 3rd, 9th, and 4th Columns are still lingering in the areas of Tiemen, Mianchi, Yiyang, and Yichuan. About 6,000 bandit troops from Changshui, Shizimiao, Baitou, and other places east of Lushi have a continued attempt to invade westward.</p>

<h3>Northern Figures Emphasize the Vice President's Native Place</h3>
<p>Ding Weifen Does Not Participate in the Election</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 24th] Northern figures emphasize the issue of the Vice President's native place and will recommend Mo Dehui, Yu Youren, and Ding Weifen to participate in the first Vice Presidential election. The Northern 29 Provinces and Municipalities Reconstruction Association has been meeting for days to discuss and has made this decision. On the 24th, they also sent Du Guangdi and others to visit the three individuals to urge them to participate in the election. Mo Dehui did not reject this urging. Mo said in an exclusive interview with this reporter on the 24th that he had not made any preparations for participating in the election. However, Mo admitted that Du Guangdi and other representatives had urged him. Mo avoided answering questions about how to nominate and campaign. The reporter then asked how the new government should handle national affairs after the first National Assembly completes the election work. Mo said: "I believe that local autonomy should be the top priority. According to the Draft Provincial and County Autonomy Regulations passed by the State Affairs Council, the county council has a two-year term before the popular election of provincial and county heads. Popular elections must be held only after the term of the councilors has expired, which means that popular elections for provincial and county heads can only be held after two years at the earliest. However, this draft still needs to be passed by the popularly elected Legislative Yuan and may be revised. When expressing the above opinions, Mo strongly advocated the early implementation of local autonomy. The work of suppressing the rebellion should be the work that the new government continues to complete. He made no other comments. Ding Weifen has decided not to participate in the Vice Presidential election. When representatives of the Northern Reconstruction Association visited Ding on the 24th to urge him, Ding said that he was old and sick and had no intention of participating in actual politics. Ding expressed his gratitude for the enthusiasm of the Northern people.</p>

<h3>Spokesperson of Ministry of National Defense Elaborates on New Measures in the Central China Pacification Zone: Shorten the Rebellion Suppression Time Targeting the Communist Bandits' Three-Seeking Tactics</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 24th] In order to defeat the Communist bandits' three-seeking tactics and their plan to cross the river in May, the Central China Pacification Conference decided last week on new measures, including implementing a general war in Central China, solving the land problem, and giving preferential treatment to military personnel by granting land to soldiers, etc. This will enable the National Army to win quickly, shorten the time for suppressing the rebellion, and reduce the people's panic and suffering. These new measures will be implemented gradually. The spokesperson of the Ministry of National Defense explained this when announcing this matter at a press conference on the 24th, stating:</p>
<p>General War Tactics</p>
<p>Liu bandit Bocheng's and Chen bandit Yi's "three-seeking policy" is to replenish troops locally, replenish food locally, and replenish weapons and ammunition on the battlefield front lines. The purpose of the National Army implementing a general war is to integrate military, political, and economic aspects in the pacification zone, increase the authority and responsibility of the pacification zone commander, expand local armed forces, mobilize the people to protect their homes and defend themselves, and cut off the bandit's troop and food supplies. If the National Army combines suppression, pursuit, and local interception and clearing, the situation on the Central China battlefield will be rapidly changed, and it will be difficult for the Liu bandits to gain a foothold and will be forced to flee back to the north of the Yellow River.</p>
<p>Land Problem</p>
<p>The purpose of solving the land problem is to require that those who till the land own the land. The government uses methods to regulate the maximum amount of land ownership and issue land bonds to enable farmers to acquire land, while reducing land taxes and implementing a 3-1 rent reduction. The apportionment of food is changed to fair assessment by the council and is not allowed to be directly handled by military and political agencies and troops to avoid abuses.</p>
<p>Land Grant to Soldiers</p>
<p>The purpose of giving preferential treatment to soldiers and granting land to soldiers is to reward the people for joining the army. Active military personnel can get three to five mu of land per person to boost morale. At the same time, people across the country comfort the soldiers and give preferential treatment to the soldiers' families. When morale is strong, the war will be easier to win.</p>
<h3>American Relief Rice Shipped from Bangkok to Guangzhou</h3>

This is the last batch of relief rice purchased by the United States in Siam and shipped to China.</p>
<h3>Sun Ke Decides to Participate in Vice Presidential Election; Will Hold Press Conference Tomorrow to Explain</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Office, 24th] Vice Chairman Sun Ke (pictured) has decided to participate in the vice presidential election. He is scheduled to hold a press conference on the 26th to explain the matter. Our reporter visited Mr. Sun at his official residence on the 24th and inquired about his vice-presidential candidacy and whether the first National Assembly should amend the constitution. Mr. Sun stated: "Since my time in the Legislative Yuan, presiding over the state's legislative authority, my greatest goal has been to formulate the Constitution of the Republic of China. After more than ten years of effort, it has finally come to fruition. Now that the constitution has begun to be implemented, it requires even more time and effort from more colleagues. The significance of my running for vice president lies in this, hoping to establish a better foundation for democratic politics in the next two or three decades and reap the great fruits of constitutional governance." Regarding the rumor that if the vice president also concurrently serves as the president of the Legislative Yuan, their authority would be higher than that of the president, therefore, the vice president should not concurrently serve as the president of the Legislative Yuan. When asked if Mr. Sun would need to resign from his position in the Legislative Yuan if elected, Mr. Sun replied: "The vice president has no authority in themselves, and the Legislative Yuan is the most democratic institution in the government. Any decision must be made by voting, so the power lies with the legislators, not the president." The reporter then asked if Mr. Sun would continue in his position as president. Mr. Sun only responded indirectly, saying that the president of the Legislative Yuan is elected by the legislators. Regarding how he would assist the president in promoting government affairs if elected, Mr. Sun believes that the constitution should be effectively implemented. As for fundamental national policies, they require long-term effort. The current important tasks are to complete the suppression of the rebellion and to complete democratic politics. If the constitution cannot effectively implement democratic politics, it is just empty talk. What we need is truly modern democratic politics to promote the Three Principles of the People, improve people's lives, enable people to live in peace and prosperity, and promote production and construction so that the country can progress." Regarding whether the constitution should be amended in this session of the National Assembly, Mr. Sun stated that it is not easy to formulate a constitution. If the current constitution is amended at the beginning of its implementation, it would harm the dignity of the constitution, destabilize the constitution, and may even lead to a new draft. This would be detrimental to the country. However, the constitution is not unamendable. The United States Constitution has been amended several times. However, amendments are made out of factual experience. If we were to amend it now, it would be based on subjective theory without factual basis. Therefore, I believe it should not be amended in this short period. If there are amendments in the future, they must be based on experience and must be carefully and thoroughly considered beforehand. We must not act rashly."</p>
<p>[Our Chengdu Office, 24th] The Rong Newspaper Association, the Reporters Association, the Sichuan Education Association, and the Political Science Association, a total of 28 organizations, telegraphed the entire country on the 24th, supporting Chairman Chiang as president and Yu Youren running for vice president, and publicly banqueted the National Assembly representatives from Sichuan, Kang, and Chongqing, requesting unanimous support.</p>

<h3>The Future of Chinese Academic Research – Opening Address to the Second Council of the Academia Sinica</h3>
<p>The Academia Sinica is holding its second council meeting in Nanjing today. The main task is to formally elect "Academicians" and to discuss other fundamental issues related to academic research. At a time when the country is facing many difficulties, gathering famous scholars from all over the country in the capital to engage in the establishment of a national research system and the discussion of promoting academic research is particularly worthy of cherishing by people across the country. Although the education and academic circles are now generally suffering from poverty and academic research is facing many obstacles, the grand plan of nation-building and the way scholars serve the country should be far-sighted. Here, we welcome the birth of the first Academicians who represent the authority of our country's academic community, and we wish the meeting success in advance.</p>
<p>The Academia Sinica can be said to be our country's national academy. Its ideal position should be the same as the Royal Society of the United Kingdom and the Academy of Sciences of France. However, since its establishment 20 years ago, because the conditions for scientific research in our country have not been sound, and then it was affected by the Anti-Japanese War, it has not completed the system of its basic components for a long time, so it has not yet reached the equivalent of the so-called national academy in Europe and the United States. The establishment of Academicians is to establish its foundation and complete the organization of our national academic community. This matter was brewing quite early. It was not until the annual meeting of the council in October of the 35th year of the Republic that the principle was passed. In March of last year, the organizational law of the Academy was amended and promulgated, and since then the preparatory work for the election has been carried out. First, universities, colleges, academic societies, and research institutions nominated candidates, and a preliminary list of 402 people was drawn up. Then, at the fourth council meeting in October of last year, the candidates were reviewed in groups, and the general meeting passed the list of 150 "Academicians Candidates" (49 in the mathematics and physics group, 46 in the biology group, and 55 in the humanities group). This general meeting will be held four months after the names of the candidates are announced, and 100 people (originally set from 80 to 100 people) will be selected from these 150 people as Academicians, and it is stipulated that at least four-fifths of the votes must be obtained to be elected. Its solemnity can be seen.</p>
<p>"Academician" is a new name in our country's academic community, and it cannot be said to be a new system. According to the organizational law, Academicians are qualified by "those who have special works, inventions or contributions to the academic field they specialize in" and "those who have led and presided over the organs of the academic field they specialize in for more than five years with outstanding achievements." That is, those who have made special contributions to specialized academic fields directly or indirectly can be elected. In addition to the future addition of Academicians and the election of council members, their main authority is to "deliberate on the direction of national academic research." We hope that the position of Chinese Academicians will become a symbol of the highest honor in the Chinese academic community, respected by the state and society, and an ideal goal for those engaged in academic research. In today's declining academic atmosphere, establishing such a supra-realistic standard for judging people will surely be a spiritual force for promoting the atmosphere of academic research.</p>
<p>Our country has always respected academic research, and scholars and hermits often abandoned fame and position and were admired by the government and the public. Unfortunately, the extreme abuses of the imperial examination system and the influence of politics gradually destroyed the development of pure science in China, and even ruined the general tradition of respecting teachers and valuing learning. The promotion of education since the late Qing Dynasty and the promotion of science after the May Fourth Movement only gained the superficial aspects of others, and there was almost the accusation of returning the pearls after obtaining the sandalwood box. The eight-year Anti-Japanese War was a cruel test; and the unprecedentedly fierce international war made us realize a bloody lesson, that is, modern warfare is a highly scientific war; and the profound application of national defense science must be based on the long-term "doing nothing for the sake of doing" specialized research by countless specialized scholars. In a broader sense, the strength of modern countries must be based on highly academic leadership, organized application, and cannot be achieved by narrow utilitarianism and the short-term efforts of a few people. This is true for modern national construction. For the sake of peaceful nation-building and for the ability to defend ourselves to ensure peace, China's efforts in specialized academic research should truly catch up quickly.</p>
<p>The emergence of Academicians of the Research Institute this time will surely create a new atmosphere in this sense and provide a strong encouragement to specialized research. However, this is just a good start, and more factors need to be developed for its future. We believe that to promote Chinese academic research, the government, society, and the academic community itself must jointly conduct a thorough review and make practical efforts in many aspects.</p>
<p>The first is the government's practical encouragement. During the Anti-Japanese War, the government spared no effort to maintain education at all levels, but we deeply feel that the government seems to be too biased towards quantitative expansion in maintaining higher education, and not enough attention is paid to the qualitative aspect. The number of units above specialized colleges has greatly increased, but the libraries and instruments of first-class universities have not seen much enrichment. Some universities have added research institutes, as if they have moved towards the direction of national academic independence, but some of them are actually unworthy of the name. In short, the regular school funding borne by our national finances in the past ten years is large, while the actual amount used to encourage advanced academic research is too small. In the future, the national education and cultural expenditure budget should not only increase the amount allocated to the units of the Central Research Institute and all research institutions; the treatment of research staff should be specially improved so that they can stay in their positions for a long time; and scientific groups and institutions with history and achievements should be treated equally and provided with assistance. The gentlemen of the Academia Sinica, based on the spirit of cooperation and seeking friends, will naturally be happy to support it.</p>
<p>Speaking of treatment, we believe that we can no longer say abstract things like "a gentleman worries about the way, not about poverty," because the current economic changes are too real and too serious. When Mr. Hu Shih came to Shanghai from the south to attend a meeting and answered questions from our reporter, he said at the beginning that the professors of Peking University are "so poor that they are about to die." Scholars and experts must be willing to be "indifferent," but the country must also enable them to be comfortable in "loneliness" so that they can have cumulative achievements through professionalism and perseverance. We hope that in addition to the government's overall and effective remedies for professors and education service personnel, researchers at all levels in research institutions must be given a standard of living that is no lower than that of professors, such as raising base salaries, planning for welfare, and allocating goods in kind, which must be taken care of in the same way as university professors. Those who bury themselves in laboratories and libraries to study diligently and strive for academic equality for the country deserve the most preferential treatment from the country.

<h3>Estimated Sale of State-Owned Production Enterprises to Private Ownership</h3>
<p>Valuation of China Textile Company Completed</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Office, 24th] The person in charge of the Ministry of Economic Affairs recently talked about the handling of the sale of state-owned production enterprises in accordance with the "Measures for the Discretionary Sale of State-Owned Production Enterprises to Private Ownership," stating that: (1) The valuation of China Textile Company has been completed, and various lists of goods have been reviewed and transferred to the Supervisory Committee for the Sale of State-Owned Production Enterprises for review. The estimated base price of the machines is based on the estimate of the 26th year of the Republic (1937). How to increase the value is being carefully researched by the committee to determine a reasonable standard for calculating the value increase. Once determined, a real transfer price will be obtained in a short period of time. (2) China Silk Company plans to issue shares for 50% of its total assets. The factories that can be used to issue shares include three silk factories and one spun silk factory. The total value of its assets is 6.34 billion yuan, which are all valuations at the time of takeover. The company has been ordered to re-estimate the value based on the base price at the end of the 26th year of the Republic (1937), create a list and submit it to the ministry for review and approval. It is currently being urged. (3) The valuation list of China Tobacco Company has been submitted to the ministry and reviewed and transferred to the Supervisory Committee for the Sale of State-Owned Enterprises for approval. However, the valuation of other finished products, semi-finished products, raw materials, and other means of production must also be estimated and submitted. It has been transferred and ordered to comply and is being urged to proceed.</p>
<h3>Principles and Methods for Provinces and Cities to Apply for Allocation of Reparations Goods Determined</h3>
<p>[This newspaper's news] Regarding the methods for allocating and purchasing Japanese reparations materials, the central government invited relevant ministries and commissions to discuss them in detail. As a result, it was believed that provinces and cities applying for the allocation of Japanese reparations materials could be handled in accordance with the following items: (1) Principles: The central and local finances were divided in the 35th year of the Republic (1946). The budgets of the provinces and cities are not within the central budget. If provinces and cities receive Japanese reparations materials, they should apply for price purchase in cash. (2) Methods: If the business units affiliated to the provincial and municipal governments have practical plans and appropriate [blank] and foundation, they should be allowed to apply for the purchase of Japanese reparations materials, but the application should be based on the business unit as the main body. The competent ministries and commissions should review its plan, source of funds, and business foundation. After considering it appropriate, the Ministry of Economic Affairs will apply for allocation and sale on its behalf. The purchase methods shall be handled in accordance with the methods for private enterprises to apply for price allocation of Japanese reparations materials. (3) Scope: The first batch of 480,000 tons of Japanese reparations materials has been approved by the Executive Yuan for the allocation principle (one-fourth is allocated for private sale, and the remaining three-fourths are allocated according to the original application quantity ratio of each ministry and commission). When the second batch of Japanese reparations materials is allocated, it will be allocated and sold to public business units in provinces and cities. However, if the ministries and commissions that receive the first batch of Japanese reparations materials agree to allocate the materials for purchase by public business units in provinces and cities, they can be handled in accordance with the previous methods.</p>
<h3>3,000 Tons of Japanese Reparations to Be Shipped from Nagoya</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 24th] The Yongxing Wheel will recently arrive in Nagoya, and the Liming Wheel is currently unloading soybeans, peanuts, and yellow beans transported from Hankou in Nagoya. The two wheels will load about 3,000 tons of reparations goods from Nagoya on the return trip, and the machinery of the arsenal will return to the country. By the middle of next month, the first batch of the advance allocation of 30% of the reparations goods (a total of about 7,850 machines) will be transported back to the country. Wu Bannong, the head of our reparations return delegation, said: The delegation is currently formulating a form specifying the types of ships suitable for each port for the reference of the domestic reparations transportation authorities. Wu is also making various efforts to ensure that each ship arrives strictly according to the schedule. Wu said: The delays of our country's ships have greatly affected the entire reparations transportation plan. Wu cited that on several occasions when ships arrived, they needed repairs, or lacked fuel and other food, which caused unnecessary delays in the transportation of reparations goods. Wu said: Any necessary repairs should be completed before leaving the country, and adequate food and fuel supplies should be provided.</p>

<h3>The Ministry of Food Formulates and Promulgates the Main Points of Food Market Management</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Office, 24th] At the beginning of this month, food prices in Nanjing, Shanghai, and other places rose. In order to maintain people's livelihood and rationalize food prices, the Ministry of Food sent personnel to Wuxi to investigate the reasons for the price increase and ordered the Wuxi County Government to strictly suppress prices in accordance with the main points of food market management formulated and promulgated by the ministry. Now food prices in Nanjing, Shanghai, Wuxi, and other places have become stable. The main points of the ministry's food market management are as follows: (1) Food transactions are limited to food markets. When necessary, the local government may supervise the food merchants to publicly agree on a reasonable price for the day. Once agreed, it shall not be changed on the same day. All food merchants in the city must abide by this agreed price before negotiating prices the next day. Violators will have their licenses revoked and be ordered to suspend business. (2) Strictly ban non-food merchants and unlicensed food merchants from engaging in the food business. If formal food merchants negotiate to purchase food that has been purchased and hoarded locally, they shall not refuse to sell it, but formal food merchants shall not trade it around. Violators will also have their business licenses revoked. (3) The local government shall investigate and register the food merchants' inventory and the daily sales volume of food in the city to understand the local inventory of food for reference in overall regulation. (4) Strengthen the management and price control of food merchants, strictly hold food merchant registration, and submit it to the Ministry of Food for approval and issuance of business licenses. Afterwards, they must operate legally in accordance with the food merchant registration rules of the Ministry of Food. Those with insufficient funds and those who violate the regulations shall be corrected at any time or ordered to suspend business. (5) When local food prices fluctuate sharply, in order to avoid panic buying and raise food prices, except for food merchants in Nanjing and Shanghai and those approved by the Ministry of Food to go to purchase, food merchants in other places may be stopped or temporarily suspended from purchasing food in Wuxi.</p>

<h3>War Situation Announced by the Ministry of National Defense</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Nanjing, 24th] The Political Warfare Bureau of the Ministry of National Defense announced on the 24th the war situation for the week of March 17th to 23rd. The full text is as follows:</p>
<p>During this week, after suffering significant casualties in the Northeast battlefield following the capture of Siping, the bandit army, with its main force now scattered in areas such as Changnan, Yitong, and Shuangyang, creating a threatening posture towards Changchun, is in reality, deeply wounded and intensifying replenishment efforts. On one hand, due to the National Army's proactive withdrawal from Yongji, which surprised the bandits, the defenses of Changchun have been strengthened. Although the bandits have the intention of making trouble, they are temporarily unable to do so. Therefore, the entire Liaobei area is relatively calm. As for southern Liaoning, since the National Army recaptured Liaozhong on the 15th and continued to advance southwest, progress has been rapid, and the highway from Jinzhou to Shenyang should be passable soon.</p>
<p>In the North China battlefield, after the failure of Nie Rongzhen's bandit troops to stir up trouble in the outskirts of Baoding, they were unable to continue their activities in this area. They personally led their First, Second, Third, Fourth, and Sixth Columns, a total of five columns, along with a large number of civilian laborers and stretchers, to invade the Jin-Cha-Ji Border Region, attempting to destroy the Ping-Sui Railway and isolate Datong. The bandits quickly invaded Yuxian, using the strength of two columns, hoping to use a "big fish eats small fish" strategy to capture Yuxian, but Yuxian remained steadfast. At the same time, they also used a large force to invade Taohuabao (south of Zhuolu), but were also repelled by the National Army. Currently, the National Army in that area is cooperating with the armed forces of the people to prepare to give the bandits a head-on blow.</p>
<p>In central Shandong, Chen Yi's bandit troops, consisting of the Seventh, Ninth, Thirteenth, New Eighth, and Four Columns, as well as four guard regiments, totaling approximately 40,000 bandits, vainly attempted to advance along the Jiaoji Railway, feigning a threat to Jinan. In reality, they were attempting to retreat back to their old nest in the Yimeng Mountain area. Currently, our powerful troops advancing eastward from Jinan have already approached the Zhoucun and Wangcun lines. Developments in the war in this area are expected soon.</p>
<p>In addition, in northern Jiangsu, Chen Yi's bandit troops, the Eleventh and Twelfth Columns, after their defeat at Dongtai, the Eleventh Column has been forced to the coast by the National Army, and the remnants of the Twelfth Column have been forced to flee north, attempting to join forces with the Second Column near Lianshui. They are currently being intercepted by the National Army in the Yilin area. There have been no major battles in this area recently.</p>
<p>In the Dabie Mountains, Liu's bandit troops, the Third and Sixth Columns, are still wandering in the mountainous areas. There have been no major changes this week. A part of the Second Column went to the Fangji area east of Xixian. On the 21st, the National Army completely wiped out one of their regiments. Most of them were captured. The main force of the Second Column and the First Column were in the areas north of Xincai and near Linquan, attempting to transport new recruits and supplies sent by Chen Yi's Tenth and Eleventh Columns, but so far, even the two columns of Chen Yi's bandit troops have been separated by our powerful troops from three sides to the southwest of Taihe and near Huaiyuan.</p>
<p>In Jin-Shaanxi, the bandits, with a force five times greater than that of the National Army, have been besieging Linfen in southern Shanxi and Luochuan in northern Shaanxi for more than half a month. The bandits have suffered heavy casualties and are stuck under the cities. Both cities are still in the hands of the National Army. When Peng's bandit troops in northern Shaanxi failed to capture Luochuan, they sent the Second and Fourth Columns, and even attempted to send small groups everywhere to disrupt the rear of the National Army, but ultimately, due to the close cooperation between the National Army and the people, the bandits' dreams were shattered.</p>
<p>In summary, during the week's war situation, the bandits have implemented a strategy of "three parts military, seven parts propaganda." This is true in the Northeast, and it is also true in North China. We believe that the National Army will definitely respond to the bandits' propaganda with action, and the justice of the Chinese nation will ultimately prevail.</p>

<h3>Exposing the Bandit Propaganda Offensive</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Nanjing, 24th] Deng Wenyi, Spokesman of the Ministry of National Defense, stated on the 24th: Rumors that the communist bandits in the Northeast plan to blockade Changchun and Shenyang with a certain amount of troops, and then send a large force into the pass, are actually still part of the communist bandits' propaganda offensive. The communist bandits have long advocated entering the pass from outside the pass, crossing the Yellow River from inside the pass, and crossing the Yangtze River south of the Yellow River, but it has been difficult to realize. Regarding the outbreak of the war on the Ping-Sui Railway, Deng also denied that it was related to the communist bandits entering the pass from the Northeast. Deng said: The bandits who attacked the Ping-Sui Railway are all bandit troops from the Ji-Cha-Sui Border Region.</p>
<h3>Underground Banks Sealed Off in Hankou; Manager of Xiechang Bank Arrested</h3>

<h3>Several Chinese and Foreign Factories to be Established in Kaohsiung</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Kaohsiung, 24th] Kaohsiung is an industrial city in Taiwan Province, with numerous factories. Recently, Chinese and foreign industrialists came here for investigation. It is reported that the following new factories will appear: (1) Liu Hongsheng, Chairman of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, plans to establish a chlorate factory in Kaohsiung, selecting the original land of the Taiwan Sugar Corporation in Qianzhen as the factory site, and has already signed a contract in Shanghai for a term of three years. The nitrogen required by the factory has been agreed to be supplied by the preparatory office of the Fourth Factory of the Taiwan Alkali Corporation. The price of chlorine is calculated according to one-sixteenth of the bottom price of potassium chlorate in Shanghai, converted to legal tender. (2) The DDT manufacturing plant planned to be established by the United Nations World Health Organization has recently sent another letter for more specific negotiations. The capital of the factory has been set at US$3 million, and it will be managed by an American named Randall. The factory will be built on the vacant land of the preparatory office of the Fourth Factory of Taiwan Alkali Corporation. All the required machinery has been shipped from the United States to Shanghai. Except for benzene, which will be supplied by the United States, the raw materials required will include alcohol from the sugar company, chlorine, and steam for power, all of which will be supplied by the Fourth Factory of Taiwan Alkali Corporation. The chlorine demand has also been specified as six tons per day. (3) Sichuan Jia Paper Company plans to establish a paper mill in Kaohsiung and has sent Cai Zhenying to investigate. It is reported that the factory will also be located in Qianzhen. (4) The penicillin manufacturing plant planned to be established by the United Nations World Health Organization in Taiwan is also said to have selected Qianzhen in Kaohsiung as the site for its construction, and will send personnel to survey the site soon.</p>
<h3>Preliminary Survey of the Wengjiang Hydroelectric Plant in Guangdong Completed</h3>
<p>Drilling Operations Underway at the Site</p>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Nanjing, 24th] According to the National Resources Commission: The Wengjiang Hydroelectric Plant, jointly operated by the Guangdong Provincial Government and the Commission, is located near Huanggang in northern Guangdong. The plan is to first build an arched run-of-river dam. The first phase of the project will generate 40,000 kilowatts. The second phase of the project plans to expand another 40,000 kilowatts, for a total capacity of 80,000 kilowatts. The generated electricity will be transmitted to Guangzhou and connected to the existing thermal power plant in Guangzhou for joint operation, supplying electricity to Guangzhou and the mechanical equipment along the transmission lines. The preliminary survey has been completed by the Wengjiang Survey Team of the National Hydroelectric Power Engineering Administration of the Commission. Currently, an American expert named Olson has been hired to assist in drilling operations at the site. The actual construction work in the future will require some foreign investment assistance.</p>

<h3>Widespread Tungsten Ore Smuggling in Guangdong</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Guangzhou, 24th] Tungsten ore smuggling in South China has recently become rampant again.

The authorities are currently taking strict measures to prevent it.</p>
<h3>Shanxi Party, Government, Military, and Civilians Organize Self-Defense Force</h3>
<p>Appealing to the Government to Provide Weapons</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Xi'an, 24th] More than 100,000 people from Shanxi Province, who have fled to Henan and Shaanxi due to the devastation of the communist bandits, have now risen up to prepare weapons and return to their hometowns. Recently, the Joint Working Committee of Shanxi Party, Government, Military, and Civilians was established, appealing to the government to provide weapons and equipment. They also sincerely request officials, dignitaries, wealthy merchants, and magnates from southern Shanxi residing in various places to think of their ancestral graves and provide support. The committee adopts a committee system and is jointly organized by representatives from the Party, government, military, and civilians of Gu County to form a self-defense force of the people. The expenses and supplies required are all raised locally. The chairman of the committee is Ye Zichu, an old member of the Tongmenghui, who is nearly seventy years old. To save his homeland, Ye has been traveling between Henan and Shaanxi for the past month, contacting various parties. He received the press here at noon on the 23rd to report on the communist bandits' disaster in Shanxi and the tragic situation. When he described the various atrocities of the communist bandits' liquidation, struggle, and massacre, as well as the plight of the people and young students in southern Shanxi who were displaced, without clothing or food, the old man's tears flowed freely, and he couldn't stop crying.</p>
<h3>Civil Air Transport Team Will Continue Flights to Linfen to Rescue Staff</h3>
<p>[Our Report] Schellin (an American), the Chief of the Flight Section of Chennault's Civil Air Transport Team, announced yesterday: As soon as the surface of the airport in Linfen City is expanded, and one of their L-5 two-seater aircraft is repaired, he will fly to the city (currently surrounded by the communist army) to rescue three Chinese employees of the Civil Air Transport Team.</p>
<p>Schellin served in the Flying Tigers during the war and participated in combat. On the 18th of this month, he took the risk of flying through Linfen for the first time to rescue Stewart, an American employee of the Civil Air Transport Team. Recently, he returned to Shanghai and described the trip to Linfen as very dangerous, because the communist army set up obstacles and guns at both ends of the airport.</p>
<p>The city only has an airport, which is about 4,000 meters long, but because there is a large tower at one end and buildings at the other end, only a few hundred feet of land can be used. When Schellin rescued Stewart, his skills were extremely agile. He flew straight into the airport in a sharp manner, and then immediately took off, which only took a few minutes. Currently, workers there are trying to remove one end of the airport wall to provide ample runway for the plane to land. If his rescue is successful this time, he will escort the three employees to Peiping.</p>

In 1939, the number of Japanese in the Philippines reached 29,057. As a result of being sent back to their country after the war, only 73 remain at present.

<h3>Chennault Gives a Speech in the United States, Emphasizing Effective Assistance to Our War Effort; The Soviet Union Supplies the Chinese Communists with Enough Military Supplies for One Million Troops</h3>
<p>[United Press Washington, 23rd] General Chennault believes that the Chinese Civil War is actually the beginning of World War III. He strongly urged the United States to have a military advisory group of 20,000 people to assist the Chinese government army at all levels, directly participating in combat. He strongly stated that unless there is immediate military, financial and economic assistance from the United States, as well as technical advisors on the battlefield, the Communist Party will seize the entire Northeast within three months.</p>
<p>During a banquet at the Overseas Chinese Writers Club, he strongly stated that the fall of the Northeast would soon lead to the redification of the rest of China, possibly Vietnam, Malaya, the Dutch East Indies, Siam, Burma, and India, all being redified. If the Soviet Union feels that its eastern flank is completely safe, it can go straight to the English Channel in three months. In this situation, it is foolish for the United States to only provide economic assistance to Europe; however, when a free and independent China exists, the Soviet Union cannot consider its eastern flank completely safe.</p>
<p>Chennault also stated that the United States must provide China with sufficient military assistance to offset what the Soviet Union provides to the Chinese Communists. He estimated that the Japanese weapons provided by the Soviet Union to the Communist army are enough to supply one million soldiers for ten years of combat. The United States must enable the Chinese National Army to have sufficient military strength to maintain Lanzhou and Xi'an in the Northwest because there are still usable air bases there, which the United States can use to bomb Soviet industrial centers when necessary. If the National Army can hold this area, it may be able to prevent the Soviet Union from taking direct military action in Europe. He generally said that if the United States wants to protect its economic investments in Europe, it must first strengthen the Soviet Union's eastern flank, and when the United States can use bases in China, the Soviet Union will definitely not attack in the West. On the contrary, if the Communist Party controls all of China, the Soviet Union will have no worries and will go straight to the English Channel.</p>
<p>Chennault said that although U.S. advisors should not directly command the Chinese National Army in combat, there must be U.S. advisors in the Chinese army at all lowest levels. He pointed out that the statement that the U.S. equipment for the National Army all fell into the hands of the Communist army is nonsense. He also recalled his command of the "Flying Tigers" and the U.S. Fourteenth Air Force in China, saying that during the period from 1940 to 1941, he found that the U.S. military almost completely ignored the Far East battlefield. The U.S. Army and Air Force simply did not have a strong and accurate Asian map. At that time, the only officials in Washington who recognized the importance of the Far East were Secretary of the Navy Knox and Secretary of the Treasury Morgenthau. He said that at that time, Secretary of War Stimson and officials of the Air Force Department opposed him recruiting pilots for the Flying Tigers. Later, through the persuasion of the late President Roosevelt, he was able to gather 250 pilots and mechanics, launch 100 P-40 aircraft, and finally destroy 299 Japanese aircraft. The current arrogance of the Chinese Communist army is actually due to Marshall's major mistake. Marshall's attempt to mediate the dispute between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party gave the Communist army the opportunity to strengthen its position in the Northeast. Chennault did not mention the amount of aid the United States should give to China, but previously, when presenting his opinions in Congress, he first said that if there could be 1.5 billion to 2 billion within two years, it could meet all military, economic, and financial aid to China.</p>

<h3>Administration of the German Occupation Zone Still Under the Rule of the U.S. Army; General Clay to Remain in His Current Position Indefinitely; The Soviet Union Resists the Allied Control Council in Berlin, the Three Powers Take Countermeasures</h3>
<p>[Reuters Washington, 23rd] The White House announced today that it has abandoned the plan for the State Department to take over the administration of the U.S. zone in Germany this summer. The U.S. zone government will continue to be responsible indefinitely by the U.S. Army. The White House document stated, "It has been determined that the agreement announced by the Army Department on January 27, in which the State Department takes over the responsibility for the non-military part of occupied Germany, with the planned takeover date around July 1, 1948, is not advisable after a thorough review of the recent situation. This new decision will not have any adverse impact on the progress of developing German responsibility for self-government. General Clay will continue to be the Commander-in-Chief of the U.S. Forces in Europe and the head of the U.S. military government in Germany."</p>
<p>[Associated Press Washington, 23rd] The White House announced today that President Truman has abandoned the plan to transfer the U.S. occupation zone in Germany to civilian rule. This is a measure agreed upon by the President in consultation with diplomatic and military advisors as another measure to prevent communism. According to some officials, Germany is the hub of the East-West conflict, and any changes in the competent authorities will inevitably weaken the position of the United States in Europe. Claylu expressed his intention to resign within the year a few months ago, but in view of today's announcement, it can be seen that he may remain in office indefinitely.</p>
<p>[Associated Press Berlin, 24th] U.S. military government governor Clay宜 said that military and political personnel intend to gradually change to civilian positions, and it has now been decided to implement it slowly. As for the U.S. garrison in Europe, a total of 100,000 people in Germany, Austria, and Trieste, the number is very small, but its symbolic value of not retreating is quite valuable psychologically. According to U.S. diplomats privately, this guarantee for Western Europe is even better than a formal alliance treaty in many ways.</p>
<p>[Reuters Berlin, 23rd] The British, American, and French military government chiefs met today at their headquarters in Berlin with representatives from the five countries of the Western European Union, Britain, France, the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg. Security was tight outside the headquarters, and the content of the meeting was also kept strictly confidential. Since representatives from the Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg, and senior allied economic, political, and financial advisors participated in the meeting, it can be seen that the West German tripartite merger negotiations launched in London have continued in Berlin.</p>
<p>[Reuters Berlin, 23rd] British military government chief Lieutenant General Robertson announced today that until the Four-Power Allied Control Council reconvenes, the British side will refuse to participate in any affiliated institutions of the Control Council. Although Robertson denied the earlier rumors that the chiefs of the British, American, and French military governments had notified the Soviet side, demanding an immediate explanation of the meaning of the Soviet Union's withdrawal from the Control Council, the British boycott of the affiliated institutions of the Control Council is tantamount to forcing the Soviet side to publicly explain its recent actions and intentions. According to the Allied Control Council, the four-power leadership department includes the four-power government in Berlin, totaling fourteen units, which are now chaired by the Soviet Union on a rotational basis. Although the Soviet authorities have announced that the Allied Control Council has no longer exercised its functions and announced the indefinite postponement of the Four-Power Liaison Committee, which is second only to the Allied Control Council, they still issued a notice today that some groups under the 13 leadership departments will meet tomorrow.</p>
<p>[Reuters Berlin, 23rd] The United States and France have also followed Britain's lead in declaring that they will refuse to participate in the affiliated institutions of the Control Council until the Control Council reconvenes.</p>

However, he did not reveal what the so-called decision refers to.</p>
<p>According to sources in the Department of Defense, Truman has so used the nation's military strength to support the government's position against the continued expansion of the Soviet Union. It is said that the chiefs of staff of each department have several plans, with different funding levels, ranging from 10 billion to 10 billion.</p>
<p>The Senate Military Affairs Committee is currently discussing the universal military training bill. Forrestal is scheduled to submit a detailed plan for the proposal to the committee on the 25th. After Truman issued a call for military training and conscription, it was rumored here that he would ask Congress to increase military spending. According to his previous request, the military budget for 1949 was 11 billion yuan. When reporters asked when the president would submit the new budget to Congress, Webb replied that he did not know. White House Press Secretary Ross said that the President told him, "The meeting only involved the budget issues of the military and did not involve anything else."</p>
<p>According to sources in the Department of Defense, the meeting suggested increasing the current 1,392,000 active military personnel to 1,963,000, which would increase the Army from the current 550,000 to 900,000, the Navy from the current 483,000 to 662,000, and the Air Force from the current 359,000 in 55 teams to 401,000 in 70 teams.

<p>[U.S. Information Service Washington, 23rd] The Senate Military Affairs Committee today heard testimony from former Undersecretary of State and Ambassador to Japan Grew, who supported President Truman's limited conscription and universal military training bill.</p>
<p>Grew said that at present, adopting universal military training and conscription can not only serve as a warning to countries with aggressive intentions such as the Soviet Union, but also encourage countries with peaceful intentions such as Greece, Finland, Turkey, and Italy to resist.</p>
<h3>Three-Power Foreign Ministers Meeting Possible</h3>
<p>[Reuters Washington, 23rd] A State Department spokesman commented on reports that the British, American, and French foreign ministers will hold a meeting, saying that although there are no plans to hold this meeting at present, it is hoped that the three governments will maintain the closest contact on relevant matters. As for whether to hold it in the form of a foreign ministers meeting or in other ways, it cannot be decided at present.</p>

Among the six members of the Finnish delegation, those who opposed and supported the conclusion of a military treaty with the Soviet Union were equally divided.

<h3>The U.S. House of Representatives is Expected to Pass the Unified Aid to Europe and China Bill; The Senate Approves the Aid to Greece and Turkey Bill</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency Washington, 23rd] The House of Representatives today began a scheduled 15-hour debate on the $6.205 billion "Unified" Foreign Aid Bill. The House leaders who advocate this measure most strongly urged the passage of the bill as a tool to prevent the spread of communism. When House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Eden presided over the debate on the bill providing $420 million in economic aid and $150 million in military aid to China, he accused Soviet communism of "using betrayal and infiltration when possible, and using force when necessary" in an attempt to conquer the world. Eden also said: The question is whether freedom under the leadership of the United States or slavery under the protection of the Soviet Union. The Foreign Aid Bill is the path of choice declared by the United States.</p>
<p>[U.S. Information Service Washington, 23rd] The House of Representatives is expected to take action on the $6.205 billion Foreign Aid Unified Bill on November 31. After that, the House and Senate will hold a joint conference to find a solution to the inconsistencies in the Foreign Aid legislation passed by the two houses. It is expected that Congress will take final action around April 10. Congressman Zhou Yide (Republican Congressman from Minnesota) gave a speech, warning the House of Representatives that it is also necessary to keep Asia free, "otherwise we will fail in Europe." Zhou said that the aid plan is a "sound investment" and that its purpose is to help democratic countries remain strong and free, "waiting for the world to be freed from its chains." He believes that the future trend of the 1 billion people in Asia is "the most profound question of the 20th century." After Zhou's speech, the audience applauded for nearly a minute.</p>
<p>[Associated Press Washington, 24th] The House of Representatives today urgently wanted to pass the $4.8 billion tax reduction bill and submit it to President Truman for signature and implementation before nightfall, so it temporarily shelved the $6.205 billion Aid to Europe and China General Bill.

<h3>Soviet Ambassador to the United States, Su Pan, Calls for Peaceful Cooperation Between the United States and the Soviet Union; Compulsory Military Training Canceled in Soviet Universities</h3>
<p>[Associated Press New York, 23rd] At a banquet held by the American-Soviet Friendship Association to honor Soviet Ambassador to the United States Pan Youxin, he gave a speech stating that the recent Communist coup in Czechoslovakia was a "domestic issue" of the Czech people. He called for peaceful cooperation between the United States and the Soviet Union. Pan Youxin denied that the coup in Czechoslovakia was due to the so-called "aggression" of the Soviet Union, and that the reactionaries were using the situation in Czechoslovakia to sow the "seeds of hostility" between the United States and the Soviet Union. Wallace, the vice-presidential candidate of the Third Party, also gave a speech at the banquet. Pan Youxin denounced the current world crisis as being provoked by "certain aspects" within the United States. He said that these "people from international reactionary concentration camps" put down an "iron curtain" around the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe, making it impossible for the world to know the truth about the region. He said that the United States' views on the Soviet Union are mostly "distorted information and rumors." Pan Youxin said that the Soviet Union's support for banning war propaganda, reducing armaments, and banning the use of atomic bombs can be clear evidence of the Soviet Union's desire for peace.</p>
<p>[French News Agency Moscow, 24th] According to TASS, Soviet Minister of Higher Education Kaftanov has issued an order that all compulsory military training in Soviet universities will be canceled from April 1.</p>
<h3>Freedom of Information Conference Again Rejects Soviet Amendment to the Agenda; Three Items Still Included in the Agenda</h3>
<p>[This newspaper] London 24th Broadcast: Geneva News, today the steering committee of the United Nations Freedom of Information Conference, led by Romulo, held a meeting. Soviet representative Bogomolov attempted to obstruct the discussion of the International Freedom of Information Charter, but was unsuccessful. Bogomolov believed that there were three items on the agenda that "harmed national sovereignty" and advocated that they should not be discussed, but the result was a vote of nine to two against (the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia voted against), so they were still kept on the agenda. The three points that the Soviet Union opposed discussing are as follows: (1) Consider drafting a charter on the transmission of news, stipulating its rights and obligations; (2) Consider establishing a permanent international organization to promote the free exchange of accurate information between countries and stipulate the method of issuing journalist cards; (3) Consider establishing government news agencies in various countries so that their news can be obtained abroad, and if necessary, agreements can be established to give various conveniences to this work.</p>
<p>The Steering Committee discussed the Soviet proposal for two hours. The result was that those who opposed the proposal believed that if the Soviet proposal was accepted, the purpose of the meeting would be completely lost. U.S. representative Boughton believed that the issue of establishing a permanent organization must not be canceled and insisted that all three points opposed by the Soviet Union be included in the agenda.</p>
<p>[Associated Press Geneva, 23rd] The United Nations Freedom of Information Conference opened today. The Soviet Union proposed giving non-UN member states the right to vote and inviting Outer Mongolia to participate, but was absolutely rejected. During the meeting, the Greek representative accused Albania and Bulgaria of undeclared war, and Chinese representative Zhang Pengchun accused Outer Mongolia of being an aggressor and engaging in military activities in Chinese territory.</p>
<p>[Reuters Geneva, 23rd] At the International Freedom of Information Conference attended by more than 500 representatives from 53 countries, China suggested that Romulo be the chairman of the General Assembly Legal Committee, which was unanimously passed. Dutch representative Gotteha was elected as the chairman of the drafting committee on the proposal of Norway, with the support of China, India, Belgium, the United States, France, and Greece, to draft a declaration on the basic tasks of newspapers and other news industries and the basic principles of freedom of information.</p>
<p>[French News Agency Geneva, 23rd] When the Freedom of Information Conference opened today, it elected the chairmen of four committees. The tasks of the four committees are to review the basic responsibilities of newspapers, sources of news, transmission of news, free release of news, and legal issues.</p>
<h3>Luminous Flying Saucers Appear in Swiss Sky</h3>
<p>[Reuters Geneva, 23rd] Swiss News Agency: Yesterday afternoon, a giant ball of light was discovered in the sky over the village of Weinfelden in northeastern Switzerland, flying rapidly southward. Later, a luminous flying saucer with a long tail was seen in Switzerland's central Xuza and flew straight west. A telegram came from Florence, Switzerland, saying that seven flying objects were seen there at four o'clock yesterday morning. They flew from the Adriatic Sea, and at the same time, there was thunder, and they flew rapidly southwest. A reporter from this agency took a train from Turin to Rome and also saw star-shaped objects flying in the sky. Although the train was roaring, the huge sound of the object flying could still be heard.</p>
<h3>Communist Party Activities in Various Parts of Southeast Asia</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency New York, 23rd] According to a New York Times report from New Delhi, the activities of the Asian Communist Party are linked to Moscow through agents stationed in several major cities in Asia by Moscow. Among the major cities, Bangkok and Hong Kong are the most important. The relevant countries that closely monitor the activities of well-known Communist leaders have discovered the methods of Communist intrusion in Asia by their reconnaissance personnel. According to investigations of wireless communications and the activities of some travelers, the Communist Party seems to have established a strong line of defense in various Asian countries. It is rumored that the working route of the Asian Communist Party, led by the Eastern Political Department of Moscow, is Wang Ming, who used to be the Communist leader in North China. It is heard that more internal organizations are set up in Harbin and Vladivostok. The headquarters in China used to be in Yan'an, and is currently not located with the headquarters of the Communist Army. According to well-informed sources, the Communist Party's agents and agitators (mostly Chinese) are sent to Hong Kong via Soviet ships sailing between Vladivostok, Shanghai, and Hong Kong, and then sneak into various parts of Southeast Asia. Other ships that frequently change crews in Hong Kong can also be used to carry Communist Party intruders. Informed sources in New Delhi believe that Moscow attempts to use international organizations such as the Trade Union Federation, the World Democratic Youth, and the Student Organization Alliance to influence the masses in Asia. Since the end of the war, representatives of the Communist Party in various Asian countries have held several meetings in Dalian, Bangkok, Hong Kong, and Vladivostok. The meeting held in Bangkok last September established the Southeast Asia Alliance and promoted Southeast Asian independence, promoted world peace, and promoted the Southeast Asia Alliance. Its actions are to sue for nationalism, and this nationalism is quite similar to the racialism of the "Asia for Asians" and other propaganda used by Japan before the war.</p>
<h3>Marshall Advocates Strengthening the State Department</h3>
<p>[U.S. Information Service Washington, 23rd] The House Appropriations Committee had previously cut nearly $16 million from the State Department's budget proposal. Secretary of State Marshall requested the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee today to restore it. He declared that the fiscal year 1949 would undoubtedly be an "emergency" year in world affairs. Marshall told the Senate subcommittee that the budget estimates submitted to the House of Representatives did not include some fund requests, which could be deleted and "would not actually hinder the conduct of diplomatic relations." He pointed out that the world situation concerned by the State Department has not improved in recent weeks, but has become more and more worsened. He said, "The problems of countries such as Germany, Japan, and Korea have not been resolved. The more such problems there are, the more attention and support for the United Nations will be needed."</p>

<h3>Palestine Policy Remains Unchanged; Britain Decides to Strictly Adhere to Neutrality; Jewish State to be Established on May 16</h3>
<p>[Reuters London, 23rd] During the debate on the Palestine issue in the House of Commons, Foreign Secretary Bevin emphasized that although the United States has withdrawn its support for the Palestine partition plan, the British government has not changed its policy and cannot change its policy. Colonial Minister Jones announced in the same debate that Britain will hand over the trusteeship of Palestine on May 15 as scheduled and withdraw all troops by August 1. Bevin said that although the British government has stated that it will do its best to find a solution between the Jewish and Arab communities, Britain will not participate in the implementation of any resolution. Britain will maintain a neutral position during the continued negotiations.</p>
<p>[Reuters Jerusalem, 23rd] The Jewish Labor Union Executive Committee met in Tel Aviv today and decided to announce the establishment of a Jewish state in Palestine on May 16, the day after Britain hands over the trusteeship.</p>
<h3>New Status Agreement for the Four Powers in the Trieste Free Territory; Italy Prepares to Join Negotiations; Tensions Rise Along the Trieste Border</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] London, 24th (Broadcast): Milan dispatch states the situation in Trieste is tense. British and American authorities have ordered 7,000 police officers to be on standby due to planned demonstrations by the Communist Party without authorization. Furthermore, following the Anglo-American-French proposal to return Trieste to Italy, South Slav troops have advanced several hundred yards, prompting the British and American sides to reinforce their troop presence.</p>
<p>[U.S. News Service, Washington, 23rd]: Italy has informed the United States of its readiness to participate in drafting a proposal to return Trieste to Italy, as suggested in the joint US-UK-France statement, for consideration by the United Nations Security Council. The State Department announced today that it had received the Italian notification, as well as a memorandum from Yugoslavia opposing the return of Trieste to Italy. The original proposal to return Trieste to Italy was submitted to Italy and the Soviet Union, with copies submitted to the Yugoslav representative here and by the US representative Austin to the Security Council. Although there is no official announcement, it is understood that US officials believe that Yugoslavia has no say in deciding the future of Trieste, as it is solely a matter for the Four Powers. They point out that the establishment of the Free Territory was due to the Four Powers approving the treaty, which can be changed with the consent of those countries and Italy.</p>
<h3>Yugoslavia Denies Demanding Gorizia from Italy; Communist Activities in Northern Italy</h3>
<p>[United Press, Rome, 24th]: The Yugoslav Foreign Ministry stated last night that it does not insist on ceding Gorizia, north of Trieste, to Yugoslavia as an exchange when Trieste is returned to Italy. The resulting misunderstanding abroad is regrettable, and Italy expressed satisfaction upon hearing this. The Yugoslav Foreign Ministry spokesman also hinted that other exchange methods would be considered. Meanwhile, in Milan, the Communist Party clashed with pro-government factions again last night, with police using tear gas to disperse them. The conflict is now in its third day.

<h3>United States Plans to Adopt a Lenient Policy Towards Japanese Industry</h3>
<p>Clapp Meets with Ashida</p>
<p>[United Press, Tokyo, 24th]: Sources close to the Clapp Mission told United Press on the 24th that the final US policy on handling Japanese industry may combine the "Strack Report and the most lenient proposals of Allied officials in Tokyo." They stated that if MacArthur's views on industry are generous, they may be adopted. If MacArthur's recommendations are less generous than the Strack Report, the latter is likely to be followed. However, the Japanese must first demonstrate their willingness to reform themselves and provide concrete evidence of reform before the United States can provide assistance. American investors planning to invest in Japan have expressed dissatisfaction with Japan's current economic situation and are hesitant due to Japan's current tax laws, and believe that Japan has not fully encouraged foreign investment.</p>
<p>[United Press, Tokyo, 24th]: Well-informed sources told United Press that Japanese Prime Minister Hitoshi Ashida assured the special investigation mission on the 24th that the United States plans to build Japan into a bulwark against communism in the Far East, and Japan will "do its utmost" to cooperate. The sources added that Ashida met with US Undersecretary of the Army Clapp for one hour and ten minutes at Clapp's invitation. Clapp made several direct requests to Ashida, such as requiring Ashida to concentrate his efforts on restoring Japan's economy as quickly as possible. It is reported that Clapp specifically requested an increase in coal production. United Press understands that the Japanese government will request the Clapp Mission to recommend allowing Japan to borrow surplus US ships. It is understood that Clapp will meet with Takeo Kurusu, Director of the Japanese Economic Stabilization Board, on the 25th.</p>
<h3>Far Eastern Commission Issues Policy on Japan; Thorough Disarmament of Japan; Regulations Instruct MacArthur to Implement</h3>
<p>[U.S. News Service, Washington, 23rd]: The Far Eastern Commission today issued a policy decision finalized on February 12th, aimed at preventing the revival of Japanese militarism in the future. The Commission stated that an instruction based on this policy has been sent to the Supreme Commander of the Allied Powers in Tokyo. This policy decision only concerns the prohibition of Japanese military activities and the disposal of Japanese military equipment, and is the product of the basic policy towards Japan after its surrender, which was passed by the Far Eastern Commission on June 19th last year.</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 23rd]: The eleven-nation Far Eastern Commission today announced Decision No. 47, stipulating: (1) Japan must disarm completely and may only retain rifles, pistols, shotguns, and other small arms used by the police; (2) Japan may not manufacture any aircraft of any kind during the Allied occupation period; (3) Japan may not build any warships or auxiliary ships, nor may it convert other ships for military use; (4) All Japanese military demobilization rosters should be destroyed; (5) Any military organizations, such as former officers' associations, must not be restored, and all kinds of military training should be prohibited; (6) All Japanese officers of all ranks who participated in World War II are not allowed to be employed, except those who opposed Japanese aggression, who may be designated by MacArthur as exceptions; (7) All military equipment confiscated in World War II must be destroyed, except those designated for use by the occupying forces and Japanese police, or those designated for reparations. This decision has been instructed to be implemented by MacArthur, and all actions taken by MacArthur based on the temporary instructions of the US Department of the Army must be re-specified when the peace treaty is signed to restore its pre-war sovereignty. Soviet representative Pan Youxin opposed allowing the Japanese police to use other small arms in the Commission's closed-door meeting, arguing that such regulations could be interpreted in various ways, leading to abuses.</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 23rd]: Soviet representative to the Far Eastern Commission, Pan Youxin, insisted that it would be best to stipulate a time limit for the destruction of such records, and requested the insertion of a clause stating that "the destruction must be completed within one to six months." The Far Eastern Commission ultimately did not approve this clause, but the Soviet representative also did not use his veto power. The Soviet representative also argued that all Japanese military equipment should be destroyed within six months, but this was also not accepted by the Far Eastern Commission.</p>
<p>International Court of Justice in Session (1) President Guerrero (2) British Judge McNair (3) Chinese Judge Hsu Mo (4) Albanian Ad Hoc Judge</p>
<h3>Observing the Corfu Channel Case</h3>
<p>— (Our Special Correspondent in Europe, Zhongxi)</p>
<p>The Establishment of the International Court of Justice</p>
<p>After the end of World War II, the United Nations organization was declared established. According to Article 92 of the United Nations Charter, the International Court of Justice is the main or highest judicial organ of the United Nations. Its organization is not significantly different from the Permanent Court of International Justice established under Article 14 of the Covenant of the League of Nations in 1922, and The Hague remains the seat of the International Court of Justice.</p>
<p>Looking back almost three years since the end of the war, international disputes and cases have emerged one after another. However, the International Court of Justice, which has been established for more than two years, has always been deserted. Of the fifteen judges who enjoy world renown, only President Guerrero, the judge from El Salvador, Chinese judge Hsu Mo, and a Norwegian judge and a Polish judge are permanently stationed in The Hague. The remaining eleven mostly reside in their respective countries, doing their own work. On the surface, the International Court of Justice having no cases indicates peace and tranquility, but if we pay close attention to events in international politics, we can feel that many countries after the war only know how to engage in political tactics and are unwilling to resolve issues through law. Therefore, there are many events that should have been peacefully resolved through the International Court of Justice, but now many want to evade the International Court of Justice and act expediently, so the International Court of Justice has become almost a mere formality.</p>
<p>The Origin of the Anglo-Albanian Dispute</p>
<p>On October 22, 1946, when a British destroyer fleet was passing through the Corfu Channel of Albania, two of them, the "Volage" and the "Saumarez", were successively damaged by mines, resulting in the deaths of 44 British sailors and injuries to 22 (five months earlier in the same year, a British cruiser was bombarded by the Albanian coastal artillery when passing through the above-mentioned channel). Afterwards, the British government found twelve other unexploded mines in the channel, and discovered that they were all newly laid, believing that this act was not unrelated to the Albanian government. Therefore, in January 1947, it requested the Security Council to handle the matter. The United Kingdom requested the Security Council to condemn the Albanian side, but this was vetoed by the Soviet Union. On April 9 of the same year, the Security Council resolved that "regarding the dispute between the United Kingdom and Albania caused by the mine explosion encountered by two British ships passing through the Corfu Channel on October 22, 1946, resulting in the death and injury of several British sailors, the Security Council, after considering the opinions put forward by both parties, hereby recommends that the parties concerned should submit this dispute to the International Court of Justice for legal processing."</p>
<p>Subsequently, on May 22, the British government applied to the International Court of Justice to file a lawsuit against Albania, believing that the Corfu Channel should be open to free passage for ships of all countries, and the Albanian government should be responsible for the discovery of mines in the channel. The Albanian government claimed that it did not know about the mine laying, and at the same time submitted a plea to the International Court of Justice, believing that although the Albanian government accepted the Security Council's recommendation, the British government applied to the International Court of Justice unilaterally without consulting with the Albanian government, and the procedure was actually incorrect, and the International Court of Justice should reject it.</p>
<p>After receiving the British government's application and the Albanian government's plea, the International Court of Justice scheduled a hearing for February 26 of this year to determine whether the International Court of Justice actually had jurisdiction over this case and whether it could accept it.</p>
<p>The Peace Palace Becomes Lively</p>
<p>The time for the opening of the International Court of Justice was decided by the President of the Court to be 4:00 PM on February 26. Because it was the first trial of a case after the war, the Peace Palace in The Hague, which had been deserted for nearly ten years, suddenly became lively. Cars loaded with judges, diplomats, representatives of the governments of the parties concerned, and lawyers. Journalists from various countries and ladies who came to attend the hearing and watch the excitement arrived one after another.</p>
<p>The courtroom for the trial of the International Court of Justice is in the right corner of the Peace Palace. By half-past three, the seats in the visitor's gallery were already full. Six large crystal lamps hung high in the hall, plus large electric lights for photography, illuminating the entire court as bright as day. The judges sit facing east, with the stenographer's seat in front to the right, the translator's seat in front to the left, and the press seat next to it. The podium for the plaintiff and defendant is in the center, with the representatives and lawyers of the British government on the right side of the podium, and the representatives and lawyers of the Albanian side on the left side of the podium. The audience seats face the judges. At four o'clock, the British representatives and lawyers, a total of eight people, entered the court first, wearing gray-white wigs and black long robes, which attracted the attention of the audience. The Albanian representatives and lawyers, a total of only three people, wore striped trousers and black tops, which were common daytime formal attire for Europeans, and were also very neat.</p>
<p>At exactly four o'clock, the court clerk shouted "Court is in session! Court is in session!" Sixteen judges, led by the Registrar, entered the court one after another, and all the people in the court stood up to pay their respects. The last one was the ad hoc judge from Czechoslovakia invited by Albania. According to the regulations of the International Court of Justice, if there is no judge of the nationality of the party concerned among the judges, the party concerned can select one of its own judges to jointly hear the case with the original fifteen judges of the International Court of Justice. It is said that Albania invited the president of the Slovak National Court to serve as its judge because there were no judges in Albania who were proficient in English or French. As soon as the judges were seated, journalists carrying cameras scrambled to take pictures of the judges, British and Albanian representatives, lawyers, and the visitor's gallery.

<h3>Soviet Union Behind the Scenes of the Czech Coup; United States Urges Collective Action; Security Council Scheduled to Reconvene Next Thursday</h3>
<p>[United Press, Lake Success, 23rd]: The United States on the 23rd demanded that the United Nations thoroughly investigate the behind-the-scenes events of the Communist Party's seizure of power in Czechoslovakia. US representative Austin said that if the Security Council can prove that the Soviet Union instigated the recent Czech coup, the Security Council should take "collective action" to save other people who have suffered the same fate. Austin asked the Security Council to hear all possible evidence about the Czech coup. If the condemnation of the Soviet Union is specific, then this condemnation will constitute an event of indirect aggression by the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>However, US officials are well aware that the Security Council will not go beyond the stage of empty talk, because the Soviet Union has the veto power of the five permanent members. The "collective action" mentioned by Austin refers to the measures taken by the United Nations. According to the United Nations Charter, political and military actions are allowed for "self-defense" to prevent aggression.</p>
<p>Austin's request for Security Council action was in response to the 26-page speech by Soviet representative Gromyko, who said that the Czech events were caused by the "warmongers" of Britain and the United States wanting to control Europe and expanding their military. Gromyko condemned the United States for interfering in France, Italy, Greece, and Turkey. However, Austin immediately replied that in addition to stating that this condemnation was incorrect, it could not liberate the Czech people from slavery. After Austin requested that the facts of the Czech coup be presented, the Security Council adjourned. The debate on the Czech events was adjourned until April 1, and was prepared to consider the US proposal to abandon the Palestinian partition plan in favor of a temporary trusteeship system on the 24th.</p>
<h3>British and American Figures Criticize the Korean Commission</h3>
<p>Believing That the Commission Is Handling Matters Improperly</p>
<p>[Reuters, Tokyo, 24th]: British and American figures who have just arrived in Japan from Korea told this agency that the situation in Korea is deteriorating rapidly, even more than outsiders imagine. The rumors about the Korean People's Army are true. If North Korea takes action, it can capture Seoul in one fell swoop. South Korea has almost no strength to stop it except for the police force. An American expert on Korean issues said that the United Nations Korean Commission has made the situation more chaotic. When South Korea holds elections in five days, it is feared that only Syngman Rhee's faction will participate. When the United Nations Commission first arrived in Korea, it had a very high reputation, but the Korean people lost faith in it because the commission quickly interfered in politics. The expert specifically criticized Jackson, the Australian representative on the United Nations Commission, and Patterson, the Canadian representative. Jackson immediately denounced South Korea as an American police state, and the United Nations Commission had not announced the name of any of the political prisoners arrested in South Korea three months after arriving in Korea.</p>

<h3>List of Draft-Age Men Drawn and Their Numbers Published in Huangpu District Yesterday; Difficult to Decide Order of Conscription at This Time</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] This city will conscript 6,000 soldiers this year. After the indirect lottery was held the day before yesterday, the numbers were opened and matched yesterday. However, the district heads of various districts are deeply concerned that there will be desertions of conscripts after the list is announced, and they all expressed dissent. The standing committee members of the Military Service Association convened a meeting to discuss and decided to first announce the list of conscripts drawn in Huangpu District to see the reaction.</p>
<p>The wooden cabinet containing the registers of conscripts from Huangpu District and other ten districts, which were sealed and preserved the day before yesterday, was personally unsealed by Zhang Xiaosong, Director of the Civil Affairs Bureau, at 3:15 PM yesterday. Jiang Zhaohu, Chairman of the District People's Congress of Huangpu District, Cheng Jingyuan, the District Head, and others were present to witness. After the registers were unsealed, the staff carefully checked them in order of the drawn numbers. By about 5:00 PM, the names of all the conscripts born in 1927 in that district had been matched. The names of the first drawn conscripts and their drawn numbers in each Bao (group of households) in that district are listed as follows:</p>
<p>Bao Number Conscript Name Drawn Number</p>
<p>1 Xu Depei 9</p>
<p>2 Le Junpeng 9</p>
<p>3 Wei Shuchun 125</p>
<p>4 Xu Zhiyao 9</p>
<p>5 Fan Bingquan 9</p>
<p>6 Wang Keyou 76</p>
<p>7 Zhang Genyuan 100</p>
<p>8 Yu Kang 5</p>
<p>9 Lou Chenzhang 9</p>
<p>10 Xu Yinkang 9</p>
<p>11 Chen Yunlai 9</p>
<p>12 Liu Genfa 9</p>
<p>13 Wang Defu 9</p>
<p>14 Lu Yaowen 9</p>
<p>15 Zhang Dade 9</p>
<p>16 Lu Yun 9</p>
<p>17 Fang Kechang 76</p>
<p>18 Ma Shixuan 76</p>
<p>Bao Number Conscript Name Drawn Number</p>
<p>19 Zhang Zhehua 76</p>
<p>20 Shi Jialu 9</p>
<p>21 Qian Xiangyuan 100</p>
<p>22 Qian Jie 76</p>
<p>23 Wang Yunhua 9</p>
<p>24 Wu Xinzhang 9</p>
<p>25 Zhao Rucheng 9</p>
<p>26 Yan Jihuai 9</p>
<p>27 Chen Jingcheng 9</p>
<p>28 He Datou 5</p>
<p>29 Fan Shufa 9</p>
<p>30 Wu Changsheng 9</p>
<p>31 He Hesheng 9</p>
<p>32 Liu Genfa 5</p>
<p>33 Han Longbao 5</p>
<p>34 (No Conscripts Born in 1927)</p>
<p>35 Gong Xiangxing 5</p>
<p>It is noted that there are a total of thirty-five Bao in this district, with more than 9,200 draft-age men, and an allotment of 267 people. However, because the allotment figures for each Bao have not yet been submitted, it is difficult to decide at this time who will be conscripted this year, even though the names of the conscripts have been drawn.</p>
<h3>Conscription in Order of Three Birth Years</h3>
<p>According to Yao, the section chief of the military affairs section of the Civil Affairs Bureau, the conscription quota is based on the Bao as a unit. Once the detailed quota for each Bao is submitted, a list of all conscripted men will be announced in batches. Men born in 1927 will be the first to be conscripted. However, if there are no men born in 1927 in that Bao, or if there are not enough men to meet the quota, the conscription year will still be extended, with men born in 1926 and 1925 being used to fill the gaps. As for the quota for each Bao, it is distributed based on the proportion of the number of draft-age men (excluding those deferred and exempted from service). Therefore, the first person drawn does not necessarily mean that they will be a conscript. Taking the first drawn conscripts in the thirty-five Bao of Huangpu District listed above as an example, because the number of people in each Bao is not large, all of the first name drawn “183” number of conscripts born in 1927 is completely empty. Only one person from the third Bao was drawn in the second number drawn "125". The largest number of people was the thirteenth number drawn "9", with as many as twenty-one out of thirty-five people drawn. Also, when checking the registers yesterday, citizens came to the City Council or inquired about the names of the drawn conscripts by telephone from morning to night, one after another, and their expressions were quite nervous.</p>
<h3>Collecting Subsidies for New Recruits' Family Support Rice by Dividing into Five Grades</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] The Military Service Association discussed the issue of raising funds for new recruits' family support fees at its sixth standing committee meeting the night before last.

The Bao of each district will be responsible for collecting and submitting the money to the association for unified distribution based on the rationing price of rice at the time of payment.</p>

(2) Before the operating rights are revoked, the electricity prices should be handled in the same way as in Jiangwan, Wusong, Baoshan, Yanghang and other districts. (3) The plant should be ordered not to arbitrarily use threats such as power outages in the front line. (4) Since the plant collects additional donations for public utilities, street lights should be installed. All the representatives also stated that they hope that the government can expedite the purchase of the land in front of the Dachang Airport, which was forcibly occupied by enemy troops, so as to avoid displacement of the residents. They also hope that the authorities will properly supervise the troops stationed in the district by military organs, so as to strengthen the exchange of feelings between the military and the people.</p>

<h3>New Information on the Gold Rush Case: Re-trial Possible for Defendants Yang and Zhan</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The case of Lin Fengbao, former Director of the Business Bureau of the Central Bank, Deputy Director Yang Anren, and Zhan Liansheng, Chairman of the Gold Industry Association, accused of collusion and fraud, previously resulted in the District Court sentencing Yang Anren to seven years in prison and Zhan Liansheng to four years in prison, while Lin Fengbao was found not guilty.

<h3>Mysterious Young Woman Swallows Phosphorus and is Rescued; Love Letters and Cards Found in Her Bag; Hidden Secret; Temporarily Detained Pending Investigation</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Zhou Tieping, a young woman from Hunan, alias Chen Ping, 21 years old, previously studied law at National Central University in Nanjing. She came to Shanghai about a month ago, and has been living without a fixed address. Unexpectedly, at around 4:00 PM yesterday, she went alone to the Qiujiang Road Fuxing Inn, rented a room, and attempted suicide by swallowing black-headed matches. Fortunately, the attendant discovered her and reported it to the North Station Police Bureau, which sent officers to the scene and took her to the bureau for questioning. A business card was found in her red coat pocket, belonging to Wang Hanxun, Chairman of the Shanghai Refugee Students Association. A love letter was also found, which read: "Ming: I am sorry for everything. I regret it, but it is too late. Although I can no longer be with you, I hope you can forgive me. Ming: Don't hate me! I will die in peace. Sincerely, Ping, written an hour ago." It was not until midnight that Wang Kaiming, a railway traffic police officer, arrived at the North Station Police Bureau.

<h3>Trial Opens in Murder of Director of EWO Brewery; Two Perpetrators Confess to Acting as Lookouts, Deny Participating in Tying Up and Beating</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The case of German director Lunner of the EWO Brewery at No. 350, Dihai Road, Yangshupu, who was robbed and beaten to death on the evening of February 24th, and robbed of US dollars, gold, and other items, has been investigated by the police, revealing five robbers. The main perpetrators are Wang Keming (also known as Wang Kemou) and Sun Xianglin (nicknamed "White Eyes"). The remaining three perpetrators, Chen Linfu, Wang Dongyuan, and Zhang Yongxing, are at large. The case was heard yesterday by Judge Wang Jiazhuo of the District Court. Wang and Sun were brought from the detention center. The victim's wife, Anna, was not present due to heart disease and was being treated in the hospital. According to Wang Keming's confession: Wang Dongyuan originally asked him to go to the EWO factory to transport beer. When they arrived, Wang told him he was going to rob something. He did not go in when they went inside, but acted as a lookout outside. He denied participating in the tying up and beating of Lunner. Afterwards, they sold two gold bars and divided 120 million yuan to him. He admitted that the silver dollars and gold ornaments that were found were from the robbery. Sun Xianglin confessed: Wang Dongyuan asked me to go to the EWO factory to fight, and later told me that he was going to rob Lunner's gold coins. The three of them entered through a bamboo fence. I was looking out at first, but later went in and saw Lunner handcuffed with one hand and tied up with the other, his face covered with clothes. I don't know who beat him to death. At this point, because three main perpetrators have not been caught, Judge Wang ordered that the hearing be adjourned and the defendants returned to custody. The court also found that Sun Xianglin had committed theft last year and was sentenced to five months in prison, and was released last October.</p>
<h3>Trial Opens in Embezzlement Case Involving Shortages of Materials in Enemy Warehouses</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The Ruichang Hardware Store warehouse at No. 340, Dengtu Road, was originally a secret Japanese warehouse containing a large amount of materials. After the victory, it was received by Lu Shishang, head of the Materials Group of the Third Theater, and transferred to the Enemy and Puppet Property Disposal Bureau, and then transferred by the Disposal Bureau to the Customs for auction. It was discovered that many of the materials were missing. Sun Zhuting and two others filed a complaint with the District Procuratorate. The prosecutor investigated Qian Zongqi, deputy tax commissioner of the Customs, and staff members He Hengshan, Huang Guojie, and Lin Xuequ, suspecting them of embezzlement, and filed a public prosecution. The District Court held its first public hearing yesterday, presided over by Judge Wu Xiangzu. Qian went to the United States and He went to Xiamen, and neither was present. Huang and Lin were brought in under detention. According to their confessions: there were more than 2,000 tons of pig iron and more than 20,000 water pipes when they were received. The auction was held three months after the receipt. There may have been mismanagement or theft, resulting in the shortage. However, they denied embezzlement. Because two important defendants were not present, the court ordered that the hearing be adjourned and the defendants returned to custody.</p>

<h3>Large Quantities of Military Arms Seized in Pudong</h3>
<p>The Garrison Command recently received a report that bandits were hiding a large quantity of military arms and that Japanese troops had buried a large amount of military equipment after the victory near Zhaojiazhuang, Chuansha, Pudong. The garrison brigade commander ordered Yan, the captain of the second team of the brigade, to lead a large number of armed officers to cross the river at night and search the address. They immediately seized three large boxes of hand grenades and a large amount of military arms in the residence of Gu Linhai near the village. The suspect was immediately arrested and taken to Shanghai. According to his confession, he was from Gucao Township, Chuansha, and confessed to hiding the military arms. However, he claimed that he did not know about the large quantity of military equipment buried underground by the Japanese troops.</p>

<h3>The Bureau of Commerce Decides to Increase Lines: Shanghai-Taiwan and Taiwan-Hong Kong</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Report] After Xu Xueyu, the General Manager of the state-owned Bureau of Commerce, returned from an inspection tour of Taiwan, he decided to increase the regular shipping lines from Shanghai to Kaohsiung and from Kaohsiung to Hong Kong. Because Kaohsiung is the port for Taiwan's fruit exports, currently only the British companies Jardine Matheson and Butterfield &amp; Swire have ships traveling to and from there. After the Bureau of Commerce opens these lines, it will regularly dispatch two ships to operate on them. The names of the ships are currently being decided by the bureau's business department, and the start of operations will not be far off.</p>
<h3>Shipping Industry Brewing Price Increases</h3>
<p>The shipping industry in this city relies on importing oil and various materials from foreign countries. Recently, due to repeated adjustments in foreign exchange rates, there has been a significant threat to expenditures. Therefore, freight rates are brewing to increase again, and the ratio of adjustment is currently being calculated.</p>
<h3>Security Authorities Crack Down on Communist Bandit Secret Organization, Detain Dozens of People with Conclusive Evidence; Mayor and Commander Jointly Host Reporters to Report Yesterday</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Report] Yesterday at 5:30 PM, Mayor Wu and Commander Xuan jointly hosted reporters in the City Hall conference room to report on the cracking down of a Communist bandit secret organization in Shanghai and the arrest of dozens of Communist Party's lurking members the week before. Mayor Wu first reported, saying that recently, a Communist bandit lurking in the city surrendered himself to the security authorities. Based on the information he provided, the Communist bandit's secret organization in the city was cracked down on, and a large amount of evidence of the Communist bandit's conspiracy activities was seized, including work reports, secret codes, plans to sabotage public utilities, and rosters. The municipal government and the garrison headquarters have arrested fifty-eight people according to the roster. After the investigation and trial are concluded, all the criminal acts and evidence will be announced together. Tomorrow (the 25th), representatives from the City Council, Local Association, City Federation of Trade Unions, Human Rights Protection Committee, City Education Association, City Chamber of Commerce, Local Security Promotion Association, and various circles' anti-communist and suppressing rebellion movement committees will be invited to view the conclusive evidence of the arrested criminals participating in Communist bandit activities, in order to show the government's emphasis on the people's personal freedom. If there is no reliable evidence, arrests will not be made casually. At the same time, it is hoped that all good citizens of the city will not easily believe rumors. The government will provide definite protection to people from all walks of life and law-abiding workers.</p>
<p>Infiltrating Activities, Conspiring Sabotage</p>
<p>Commander Xuan continued by reporting that the garrison headquarters had repeatedly received information that the Communist bandits planned to cause major disturbances during the National Assembly, and the Communist bandits in northern Jiangsu also planned to cross the Yangtze River in large numbers during this period to enter the Nanjing and Shanghai areas to carry out activities. The city's security authorities have paid special attention to this. Until last week, a Communist bandit came to surrender and provided the address of the secret organization in Shanghai, thus leading to a smooth crackdown. The roster of the Communist bandit's lurking members in the city was seized. The list only contained numbers, not surnames or names. Based on this clue, the security authorities have arrested fifty people, most of whom are workers. There are people from the factory areas in southern Shanghai, western Shanghai, and eastern Shanghai. In addition, there are dozens of others who need to be arrested continuously. However, the remaining Communist bandits may take this opportunity to incite and create disturbances. The authorities have already taken precautions.</p>
<p>Good Citizens Will Be Guaranteed Protection</p>
<p>In order to demonstrate the government's respect for human rights, representatives from various people's organizations are especially invited tomorrow (the 25th) to view the conclusive evidence of the arrested criminals, in order to clarify that the government will never arbitrarily infringe upon the personal freedom of law-abiding workers and citizens, and that the meaning of arresting Communist bandit elements is to protect the good people. The arrested criminals will be interrogated according to the law and dealt with according to the severity of the circumstances. This arrest of a large number of Communist bandits is different from before, because this step is to crack down on the organization first and then arrest according to the roster, so the arrest is absolutely certain. At the same time, a large amount of evidence was also seized, including the Communist bandit's plan to sabotage public utilities and the work reports of last year's labor unrest and student unrest, so there is absolutely no wrongful arrest. He continued by saying that after this crackdown, the remaining forces of the Communist bandits lurking in the city have been greatly weakened, and their plan to launch a conspiracy in April and May is impossible to realize. Five million citizens can live and work in peace. Recent rumors that Communist bandits have crossed the Yangtze River in some places are all untrue. The Jiangnan garrison forces are strong, the navy patrols the Yangtze River, and the Songhu area is closely guarded, so there is nothing to fear and no worries.</p>
<p>Strictly Punish According to Law, Never Condone</p>
<p>Finally, Mayor Wu added that the Communist Party may also use the arrested criminals' family members crying and making trouble to launch a bitter trick. However, the government will strictly handle the case according to the law and will not condone it in the slightest. As for the fugitives, it is hoped that they will come forward to surrender, and they will be given lenient treatment. Whether the arrested criminals will be transferred to a special court or other judicial organs in the future has not yet been decided, but according to their crimes, they will be dealt with in accordance with the recently promulgated "Regulations on Harming the Republic of China during the Suppression of Rebellion." Commander Xuan also added that surrender can be dealt with by reducing the sentence. In a short time, the detailed situation of the whole case can be announced.</p>

<h3>Military Vehicle Maintenance System</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Chongqing Fourteenth Dispatch] This March, military vehicles implemented a five-level maintenance system. The Automotive Repair General Factory of the Ministry of Military Administration, merged with the Yangon Body Factory, Chongqing Automotive Repair Factory, and Special Vehicle Repair and Manufacturing Factory, was reorganized into today's largest fourth-level sixth repair factory in the West China region.</p>
<p>As early as 1938, the American automotive engineering magazine had already denied repairs, emphasizing the importance of prevention and replacement. However, after visiting the automobile factory, one would know that although the General Logistics Headquarters has implemented a maintenance system of factories at all levels in various places, military vehicles are only repaired when they are damaged. If there is a problem, they must be sent to the fourth-level repair factory. Therefore, the phenomenon reflected in the repair factories at all levels across the country is: second- and third-level factories have few cars to repair, but the fourth-level factories can never finish repairing cars.</p>
<p>According to American standards: first-level maintenance is for each car driver to prepare a set of on-board tools for self-maintenance. The second level is responsible for inspecting the repairs of each fleet and adjusting the lubrication of each part. The third level is regular maintenance above 1,000 kilometers, replacing steel plates, carburetors, platinum, generators, etc. The fourth level is to set up factories in fixed areas, responsible for the complete repair of vehicles, engine, differential box and other replacements. The fifth level is the manufacturing plant, using waste car materials to manufacture parts and new cars. There are now two automobile manufacturing plants in China, one each in Qijiang and Shanghai, both of which are subordinate units of the Logistics Headquarters.</p>
<p>The car is driven by us, and often we can't even talk about first-level maintenance. Either the brake oil or lubricating oil is lacking, or there are not enough parts, so first- and second-level maintenance cannot complete the task. And various precision tools and instruments such as steam cleaning machines, generator core testers, brake lining grinders, are especially not fully equipped by the first-level repair factories. Director Zhu Heqin said it well: "The fourth-level repair factory is like an omnipotent doctor. It is necessary to apply mercurochrome to the patient, and the surgery of laparotomy is even more inevitable."</p>
<p>As far as the reporter knows, most of the transportation units in the Chongqing area are stationed in the mountains. The sixth factory in Shantongzi is forty kilometers away from Tuqiao. To save gasoline, the transportation units disassemble and collect broken car parts into one car and send it to the factory for repair. So repairing one car is more difficult than repairing ten cars. It is reported that there are currently about 3,750 vehicles driving in Sichuan, Guizhou, and Yunnan, all of which rely on the two fourth-level factories in Yu and Zhu to be responsible for maintenance. The work is indeed arduous.</p>
<p>Director Zhu Heqin graduated from the first class of Jiaotong University and participated in the transportation service in 1929. He is an experienced engineer. His slogan is: "Work is happiness, laziness is a sin." He claims to be a streetcar, and all actions follow the track, so all 300 machinists in the factory respect and fear him. Few people go out at night, and they all drink tea (100 yuan a cup) in the club, read newspapers, play chess, and listen to broadcasts. Director Zhu once frankly told the reporter: If the Sixth Factory has any achievements, it is due to the leadership of Yu Sheng, the former director of the US Transportation Office, and Qiu, the director of the Eastern Sichuan Supply Bureau.</p>
<p>However, despite this, if we do not find ways to enrich and strengthen the automobile maintenance institutions in the West China region, simply imitating the American system will still have limited results. During the war, the total number of vehicles used by the US military in China was more than 18,000, traveling on the Sichuan, Guizhou, Yunnan, and Xianggui highway lines. Although it was only equipped with two special-level factories (abbreviated as URP Unit Recor,itioning Plant, specializing in repairing waste cars and parts) three fourth-level factories, and seven third-level factories, because they were well-equipped and met the conditions for a graded maintenance system, they achieved twice the result with half the effort.

<h3>Inspecting Xuchang [The Poor Turn Over]</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Zhengzhou Seventeenth Dispatch] On some walls in Xuchang City, you can still vaguely see the slogan "Open granaries to relieve the poor." We know that the Communist bandits use fighting the rich and helping the poor as their slogan, so let's see how the Communist bandits do this work? Indeed, the Communist bandits' first contact is with the poor. At first, they said that they wanted to help the poor, but they didn't know who the poor were, so they wanted all the poor to come out. Then, on each street, they established a poor people's association, elected a poor people's leader, and divided the poor into: first-class poor, second-class poor, and third-class poor. So they inquired about some poor people, who was rich on your street, who was the richest. That night, the richest and relatively rich people became "national special agents." They arrested the rich people and asked them to hand over things. The next day, the Communist bandits led the poor people's association to fight. Some of the things that were picked up were distributed to the poor. Once, each person was given a measure of rice. After that, the poor turned over like a railroad, becoming useless. They couldn't get relief grain, and they couldn't find work to do. Finally, they followed the Communist bandits to rob a few mills. After more than 1,000 rickshaw workers were organized, they lost their jobs. People from the Hebei Xuchang Compatriots Association said: "Originally, we only had 80 unemployed people. When the Communist bandits arrived, there were 280 unemployed people, which is equal to three-tenths of the state's people unemployed." Who is to blame for this? At this time, the Communist bandits didn't care anymore. There is also a miracle of the Communist bandits, which is to ban prostitutes. However, no one could answer what work the prostitutes found.</p>
<p>In the Communist bandit newspapers collected in Xuchang, I only saw one that cared about a poor person. It was a poor person who sold fried dough sticks, and he brought a sleeper to fry dough sticks. The Communist bandit's newspaper gave him a big fanfare.</p>
<p>The poor who relied on the railroad to eat are finished, the poor who relied on pulling carts are finished, the poor who relied on washing and mending clothes are finished, and the poor who relied on selling their bodies as prostitutes are also finished. What kind of poor people are doing well? Yes, some poor people who do petty begging are doing well. Those poor people who do petty begging have to ask for 2,000 or 3,000 from this family, and they have to ask for 4,000 or 5,000 from that family. They used the money they asked for to buy firecrackers and throw them at some women, laughing and laughing for a while, which was very much favored by the Communist bandits. These petty beggars came with the Communist bandits and left with the Communist bandits, seemingly forever cared for by the Communist bandits, living a happy life. Before the Communist bandits arrived, it only cost 30,000 yuan for a dou of grain. Later, it rose to 80,000 or 100,000. The grain was taken away by the Communist bandits day by day, and the price increase was like this. If the Communist bandits were not driven away, 19 out of 10 people in Xuchang would be starving. The old people said: "If the National Army had come a few days later, we don't know how many people would have run away to wasteland." Some old people had no choice but to sell some things because the Communist bandits insisted on using the fake currency of the Jinnan Bank at 25 to 1, so selling and buying was out of the question. During the New Year, few old people went to buy meat to eat, first because they didn't have much money, and second because they were afraid of struggle. The Communist bandits were very angry and said: "We are here, and you don't celebrate the New Year?"</p>
<h3>Land Reform and Joining the Army</h3>
<p>On the propaganda materials of the Communist bandits, the words "land reform" and "joining the army" are everywhere. The work of "land reform" has also been done in the countryside of Xuchang, but it has not yet reached the stage of "joining the army." Everyone is clear that "land reform" is a means for the bandits to lure the old people to "join the army." The Communist bandits' Hebei-Lu-Yu Daily on November 2nd in Taihang, Taiyue, Jinnan, and Hebei-Lu-Yu successively launched a message of joining the army craze, which itself stated: "The children of the peasants who have turned over have poured into the Liberation Army, reaching tens of thousands of people or more." In another message on the same day about women's work, there is the phrase "to mobilize poor women to participate in land reform work." Then isn't it clearly stated that after the men go to "join the army," the women will cultivate the land? Although the Communist bandits' propaganda is full of talk about the "joining the army" craze, some places can't cover up the old people's unwillingness to "join the army." On that day's newspaper, there was the saying "Although women say they don't pull their legs in words, they are still passive and have not developed to the point of sending their husbands and sons to 'join the army,'" and there is the following record: "At the beginning, the new soldiers couldn't understand what the cadres in yellow military uniforms said, so they muttered, 'This is probably leading our new recruits. I don't know where they will take us?' Some individual soldiers said, 'No, just watch the expressions and act accordingly.' (meaning to desert)" "This place is not good, we can take the opportunity to run?" Regarding the real situation of "joining the army," every prisoner tells you the same thing: "You have to join." The fathers couldn't do anything, and the mothers couldn't do anything, so there were 5,000 here and 10,000 there who "joined the army."</p>
<p>Because of the "joining the army" of a large number of personnel, the "land reform" movement became a failure. What relying on "hiring poor peasants as the backbone to thoroughly complete land reform," "hiring poor peasants to personally do it," are all empty slogans. The so-called "eight prohibitions and ten requirements" within, such as prohibiting eating and drinking, prohibiting killing and injuring ploughing cattle, destroying agricultural tools, and eating bran and vegetables to save food, urging every household to plant spring vegetables to replace grain, preventing famine, loving Mao elm, willow, poplar trees and locust trees, and planting more spring wheat, etc., have also become empty words. The fact is that in the Communist bandits' Henan-Anhui-Jiangsu Administrative Office's instructions on the current financial work (issued on January 28, 1948), the commissioners and county heads clearly stated: "The financial and economic situation in the border area is currently facing difficulties! The main manifestation is in the old liberated area counties. In terms of finances and grain, the wheat roots are generally exhausted, and there is not much cash grain in autumn grain. In terms of regions, income and expenditure are very unbalanced, so that some regions have the phenomenon of borrowing grain from the people in terms of wheat and autumn. Also, because the war situation and war service work have not been adjusted and redeemed in time, the guarantee of financial and grain income and expenditure to the higher level is not enough. Individual units have even paid deposits, which has affected the income and expenditure of funds. Military expenditure is also greatly constrained due to overdrafts. In terms of price changes, there are contradictions between decentralized collection and centralized income and expenditure in the region, and it is slow to solve the urgent need in terms of time, and it suffers from rising prices. In terms of economy, the currency is greatly affected by the war. On the one hand, the market is shrinking and the legal currency is active. On the other hand, prices are generally soaring and the currency value is declining. The imbalance between the edge and the central area, and the area far and near the battlefield in the central area, the imbalance between prices and currency value is more disparate than before. Some cities have refused to accept the currency or have spontaneous strikes, and the phenomenon of outflow of materials and intrusion of legal currency in the edge area is still very serious. Comparing everything, it is enough to explain the difficulties, but it is only the beginning of the difficulties. The war is still going on, and a part of the enemy's main force is still entrenched in our central area and has not withdrawn, and there are still five full months before the wheat harvest (whether the harvest is good or bad is still unknown)! Therefore, this instruction requires "mastering the current situation is the most basic link in financial work." The method is to levy and borrow. "The old areas are too frequent for military use and war service, and the existing grain reserves are not enough to cover income and expenditure. We must levy and borrow." After the Communist bandits' "land reform," a serious famine occurred, which is a great irony of the "land reform" movement. Because the "land reform" movement entered the "joining the army" movement, since the "land reform" movement collapsed, the "joining the army" movement must also reach the point of collapse. This is a big contradiction that the Communist bandits have no way to eliminate. (Reporter Fan Shidong of this newspaper)</p>
<h3>Taiwan Province Uncovers Corruption, Zhang Wencheng and Others Are Accused</h3>

<h3>Risking Death to Eat Pufferfish, Two Men in Wuxi Die of Poisoning</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Wuxi Twenty-third Dispatch] Every year in February and March, a large number of "pufferfish" appear in the river between Jiangyin and Zhenjiang. Each fish weighs about one to four catties, with a small head and a large belly, and swells up like a drum. Residents along the river often catch, wash, and cook it with pork, with the reputation of "eating pufferfish and all other tastes are gone." However, the fish contains a large amount of toxins. Its eyeballs, ovaries, and blood must be specially removed and discarded, and then the fish body must be turned over and washed with clear water. When cooking, the pot should be covered with reed mats to prevent dust from floating in. If one is not careful, it will inevitably lead to disaster. Therefore, non-residents along the river dare not try it lightly without absolute certainty. Yesterday morning, Li Zhenbang, a coolie from northern Jiangsu (67 years old), and Chen Yiqing (40 years old), two men next to Huinong Bridge in this county, picked up some pufferfish intestines on the garbage dump while scavenging. Li, not knowing that this thing contained toxins, thought it was a gift from heaven, and cooked it after returning home. After eating, the toxicity broke out, vomiting non-stop, with strange pain in his stomach. After a few minutes, he fell to the ground and died. Later, the local gang leader reported to the District Prosecutor's Office to send someone to examine the body, confirming that he died from pufferfish poisoning. Because no family members claimed the body, the gang leader was ordered to prepare a coffin for burial.</p>

<h3>After the Murderer of Xu Shouchang Was Sentenced to Death, He Wrote a Big Letter of Disagreement and Appealed</h3>

<h3>Fuzhou Plans to Establish a Pulp Mill</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Fuzhou Twenty-second Telegram] The matter of Zhongyuan Company cooperating with American businessmen to open a pulp mill in Fujian has matured as a result of Manager Qian Zining coming to Fujian to negotiate. Qian has left Fuzhou and is said to be going to the United States to attend the US aid material allocation meeting to promote the American businessman Jiangnan Construction Company's $20 million investment. Construction is expected to begin this autumn. It is said that this scale is very large, and more than 100,000 workers need to be mobilized to participate in the work in the early stage of the factory.</p>
<h3>There is Actually the Smell of Gunpowder in the Buddhist Temple, Ammunition and Other Military Supplies Were Found</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Fuzhou Twenty-first Telegram] It was recently reported that Linsen County's Beiling Linyang Temple in Fujian Province is suspected of privately storing military supplies. The county police station was ordered to search the temple and found two boxes of hand grenades, containing 40 rounds of ammunition, and the offending monk Xinjing and others were detained in Fuzhou. However, it has been claimed in recent days that the bullets were actually left behind by the 80th Division of the National Army when they retreated from Jinzhou during the Anti-Japanese War in 1941 and have nothing to do with the monks in the temple. The authorities believe that since the suburbs of Fuzhou are close to Linshi and have been repeatedly unsettled recently, the hiding of this ammunition in the temple is highly suspicious. In order to thoroughly understand the situation, the case will be carefully investigated.</p>
<h3>Bengbu Wealthy Merchants Owe Unpaid Assessments, Four People Were Detained by the Police Station</h3>

It is now learned that the responsible persons of the four debtor companies, including Weida Company and Brothers Cigarette Factory, such as Wang Ziqing, were detained by the police station on the 20th and were forced to pay strictly.</p>

<h3>中國學術研究的前程　（上文接第二版社論）</h3>
<p>The Future of Chinese Academic Research (Continued from the Editorial on Page 2)</p>
<p>Second, is the sympathy and financial support of society. The traditional academic style that emphasizes "practical application to the world" seems to be both the cause and the result of our general social atmosphere of "seeking quick success and instant benefits." Therefore, the purely academic research that does not seek immediate results and fame has been despised and treated coldly by society for a long time, and this is especially true today. In today's era of drastic economic changes after the war, "strong winds" have almost bent even the "strong grasses," and it seems difficult for us to quickly reverse the declining trend. To make avaricious merchants respect scholars and donate funds to research endeavors may be too idealistic. However, things depend on human effort, and changing customs is a gradual process. We cannot but expect that the government's "respect for the virtuous and promotion of learning" and the self-respect of academic workers will gradually increase society's widespread sympathy for intellectuals. Recently, as new entrepreneurs have increased and come into contact with foreign entrepreneurs, leaders in the industrial and commercial sectors will gradually realize that supporting specialized research is beneficial to the success of their enterprises. We can also use this to encourage those with accumulated wealth and knowledge to gradually become involved in academic endeavors. Isn't it worth our best efforts to promote and try to imitate the fact that British and American capitalists use huge inheritances to support research endeavors, and that some large enterprise foundations contribute to scientific progress?</p>
<p>Third, is the self-respect of the academic community itself. If scientists in Europe and America deserve the respect of the world, I believe that scholars in China today, enduring the hardships of life, the relocation of their families, and the coldness of society, while still burying themselves in research and preserving their original selves, are truly admirable. We believe that most of the hundred academicians who are about to be born are those who have been tempered by being content with a simple life and solitude, and who still devote their remaining energy to their solitary work. The future progress of Chinese academia depends on the model set by this generation of academicians, which will create a positive atmosphere. And for those who are engaged in research work in general, including professors who are reluctant to give up research work, we earnestly hope that they will cherish themselves even more and leave more seeds for Chinese academia and plant more good causes to create a brilliant future for culture. Stabilizing their lives is a common responsibility of the government and society. The academic community "does its best" and must maintain a general sense of clarity and ease, not shifting its ambitions due to dissatisfaction with life, and not undermining its achievements due to worldly fame and fortune. In our ancient civilization, there are too few scholars who are truly accomplished and full of hope. We cannot but base ourselves on the principle of reproaching the worthy and expect them to be more modest and single-minded, cooperating with each other, and contributing their utmost to Chinese academia with a spirit of "doing nothing for oneself" and perseverance.</p>
<p>Fourth, the assistance of international academic cooperation. The progress of academic research in China today has shown more performance, which is of course an important factor in completing China's academic independence. Here, we only need to briefly mention past examples and current good trends, and there is reason to be optimistic. For example, the brilliant achievements of Chinese geology, which have been obtained through the cooperation of foreign scholars and its own efforts, have given significant encouragement to scientists and scientific organizations in various departments; and the good results obtained by Chinese scientists under difficult conditions during the war have also been well received by scholars from various countries. Dr. Joseph Needham (originally translated as Nidehan) in England, who spoke for China after returning to England, is a notable example. In the past two years, China has responded to many international scientific conferences by sending or is about to send experts to attend; this is as encouraging as the general trend of educational cooperation in the United Nations. In the future, we should not only be good at using the existing special funds for culture and accepting international spiritual and material assistance, and also plan to extend foreign experts to China to teach or assist in work, but more importantly, we should actively strengthen our own efforts by means of international sympathy and cooperation.</p>
<p>Fifth, the stability of the academic research environment. In China today, specialized research institutions are very rare, and most of the work of various specialized academic research is still carried out in ordinary universities or colleges. Most researchers can be said to be inseparable from professors in first-class universities. They engage in research with their remaining energy amidst the hardships of life and the arduousness of teaching. How can they be expected to have good results if their environment is not peaceful? However, in the past two years, university unrest has arisen one after another, strikes have been heard from time to time, and a single call has drawn a hundred responses, discarding coursework like worn-out shoes, which has become a strong satire and threat to the status and work of professors and scholars. We often see military police carrying out arrests, which sometimes involve university students and cause disturbances, or presidents dismissing some professors and causing disputes. We cannot but implore the government authorities to grant the greatest tolerance to the words of teachers and students, except for those who are indeed engaged in political conspiracies that endanger public security, under the major principle of respecting academic and freedom of thought. However, the propagation of dogma and the pursuit of truth can never coexist, and violence or the suspension of classes is certainly the enemy of science and culture. All activities that undermine stability and academic progress should be forbidden by pure scholars. Then, should the stability of the research environment in academic institutions be subject to academic public opinion sanctions, or is it merely regarded as a matter of educational administration?</p>
<p>In short, the ideal goal of Chinese academic research is of course to complete China's academic independence and to stand on an equal footing with all countries in the world academically. Although it is still far from the goal of academic independence—such as Mr. Hu Shih's advocacy of "establishing the foundation of academic independence in ten years"—but with the achievements already made and the current trend, we have indeed seen a bright future in the dawn. The birth of the "academicians" of this research institute will certainly encourage the efforts of our experts and scholars, arouse good impressions in the international academic community, and enable us to embark on a solemn journey and complete the mission of academic independence, national construction, and success in China.

<h3>上海教育界無危機可言　教局發表書面談話　駁斥搶救教育聯會</h3>
<p>No Crisis in Shanghai's Education Circles; Education Bureau Issues Written Statement Refuting the Education Rescue Federation</p>
<p>[Dahua News Agency] Yesterday's news reported on an advertisement from the so-called "Shanghai All Circles Education Crisis Rescue Federation," which defended itself against the Education Bureau's decision to deem it an illegal organization and ban it. The person in charge of the Education Bureau issued the following written statement in response: "There is currently no crisis in Shanghai's education circles at all. The bureau approves all requests for free education from needy students. Although teachers' lives are still difficult, the bureau is gradually implementing benefits. As for the parents' side, students have not dropped out of school due to tuition fees, so the burden problem does not exist. The allocation of teachers' training funds was jointly decided by representatives of schools in the city and suburban districts, and there were no objections from any party, and all funds have been distributed. All of this proves that there is no crisis in the city's education, so the so-called "rescue" is purely a baseless claim. Its intention is to create a crisis and attempt to create unrest in the education circles. In short, "The bureau is responsible for stabilizing Shanghai's education, and will, as always, strictly ban illegal organizations that are actually creating a crisis."</p>

<h3>Private Schools Overcharging Tuition; Li Ximou Personally Conducts Spot Checks</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] It has been over a month since the start of the semester for private primary and secondary schools in this city, and the Bureau of Education has received many reports from parents of students regarding schools overcharging tuition. Acting Director Li Ximou attaches great importance to this and personally went to various schools yesterday morning to conduct spot checks on the fees charged. Four schools were inspected yesterday, and he will continue to conduct spot checks at various schools in the coming days when he has time. According to Acting Director Li, he told reporters: The points of inspection at each school are: (1) Is the finances open? Is the tuition used for teacher welfare? (2) Is the free quota in line with standards or expanded as much as possible? (3) Is the number of students overcrowded? If the overcharged fees are used for public purposes and to benefit teachers, then it can be excused. Some schools issued six months' salary to teachers and staff at the beginning of the semester, and the Bureau of Education will encourage this point. Schools with particularly outstanding performance in this spot check will be rewarded. Those with poor management will also be punished, and the list of rewarded and punished schools will be made public.</p>
<h3>World Games Football Preliminary Round Full of Twists and Turns; The Problem Centers on the Xingdao Team; Rong Qizhao Consults Wang Zhengting</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] The preliminary selection of our country's football team for the World Games has been full of twists and turns and has reached a stalemate, which has not yet been resolved. Initially, there were rumors that the Xingdao team would not participate in the World Games preliminary selection and would be led by Hu Hao to South America, but the news later subsided. The Shanghai Interport team went to Hong Kong, originally intended to serve as the World Games preliminary selection, but returned north in a hurry. Dr. Rong Qizhao, chairman of the selection committee, flew between Hong Kong and Shanghai, but failed to resolve the personnel issues. When the Javanese Overseas Chinese football team arrived in Hong Kong to participate in the preliminary selection, Dong Shouyi flew to Hong Kong to participate in negotiations, and his remarks upon returning to Shanghai seemed to indicate an improvement in the situation. However, this newspaper received a telegram from Hong Kong stating that the Malayan Overseas Chinese telegraphed Hong Kong to express their opposition to selection behind closed doors, insisting on participating in the preliminary selection. There were also proposals in Hong Kong to re-conduct regional selections and reorganize the selection committee. Suddenly, there was news that the Xingdao team would join the Guangzhou Police Team to attend the National Games and not participate in the World Games preliminary selection, and so on. The matter started again with twists and turns. Yesterday, a telegram from the United Press in Hong Kong explicitly stated that Hu Hao recommended the Xingdao team representatives to attend the World Games, so the twists and turns and the truth were revealed, and it seemed that the center of all the problems was the Xingdao team. Dr. Rong Qizhao, chairman of the football selection committee, has returned to Shanghai from Hong Kong. This newspaper's reporter visited him yesterday. According to him, the Malayan telegram of opposition was indeed the case. The Ministry of Education had instructed overseas embassies to inform overseas Chinese to participate in the National Games, but it did not explain that the basketball, track and field, and swimming events in the World Games preliminary selection would be selected in the National Games, while football would be held separately in Hong Kong. Therefore, a misunderstanding occurred, thinking that they only needed to participate in the National Games and did not need to go to Hong Kong. The Javanese team also took a long time to understand clearly when they left Batavia. Since Malaya requested to participate, they should be given the opportunity. However, due to the proximity of the departure date, they were limited to arriving in Hong Kong before the end of April, otherwise, due to time constraints, it could only be regarded as a waiver. The selection committee will also not be reorganized, but only a few more people will be hired. As for all other issues, as well as the selection of the representative team, etc., a final decision will be made after consulting Dr. Wang Zhengting.</p>

<h3>Hu Shi Passes Through Shanghai to Nanjing to Attend the Academia Sinica Academician Council Meeting</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] Dr. Hu Shi came south from the northern plateau with a healthy spring spirit. After presiding over the board of directors of Peking Union Medical College yesterday, he took a train to Nanjing that night to attend the Academia Sinica Academician Council meeting held in Nanjing today. The doctor's trip is burdened with three important tasks, and it can be said that it is not in vain.</p>
<p>From several visits to the doctor, I gained a valuable experience: the doctor is most afraid of unconditionally meeting reporters and asking him to express the views of a philosopher and historian on current events. Yesterday was a big exception and it was also lucky. The old man, in his busy schedule, chatted with several reporters who visited him for more than an hour on the thirteenth floor of the International Hotel, a skyscraper. He revealed all the major decisions of the Peking Union Medical College Board of Directors. The reporters wrote down notes like they were listening to a class in a professor's home. This, to the doctor, was like a small bridge and flowing water, pouring straight down without hesitation.</p>
<p>Most of the National Medical Talents are Products of Peking Union Medical College</p>
<p>Starting from the budget of more than 680,000 US dollars for Peking Union Medical College, converted into the prevailing black market value, he used a pen to combine the two numbers into one number, which surprised him, and he repeatedly called it "envy." He said, "I am afraid that the sum of the current national university education funds is not as much as the budget of this one Peking Union Medical College." The topic naturally turned to his ten-year academic independence plan that he released to reporters last year. Although he waved his hand and did not want to read it, he could not help but use "Peking Union Medical College" as a metaphor.</p>
<p>The doctor believes that spending more than 680,000 US dollars from the Rockefeller Foundation every year to concentrate on training a Peking Union Medical College seems like a lot of money on the surface, but in fact, almost all of the medical and nursing talents with achievements in various parts of the country today are "products" of "Peking Union Medical College," thereby teaching and raising more talents. This kind of intangible gain is worth a good calculation. Therefore, he advocates that the government should concentrate its efforts to run ten good universities in a short period of time under the principle of focusing on quality rather than quantity. The Rockefeller Foundation can do "one ability," and the country should do "ten abilities." Although his plan has been published, the reactions from various parties have been different. From the perspective of the entire country, he still insists that it is necessary. Now that the country's financial resources are insufficient, this plan is just a plan.</p>
<p>I Hope the Soviet Union Today Will Not Repeat the Mistakes of History</p>
<p>From another corner, the topic was led to the edge of history. The doctor believes that in the past 20 years, two major tragedies have occurred in the world. One is the two defeats of Germany, and the other is the defeat of Japan. The two countries have worked hard for decades, accumulated a lot of effort, and established themselves as major powers. However, they were destroyed in one fell swoop due to a difference in thought. He seemed to have endless emotion in his words. He said that when Japan invaded China, I repeatedly warned Japan not to destroy the efforts they had painstakingly accumulated for decades, but the result is what it is today. With the same feeling, he also hopes that the Soviet Union today will be passively harmless to people and actively beneficial to people, and become a major power in the world, and be admired by all countries, and not repeat the mistakes of history and destroy itself. He said that in the "Hu Shi Wen Cun," "Hu Shi's Diary in the United States," and his correspondence with Xu Zhimo in the Soviet Union, he retained this kind of yearning for the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>Despises Isolationism and Despises Wallace</p>
<p>Talking about domestic affairs, the doctor reiterated his view that "peace is more difficult than war," and since peace is impossible, it is better not to talk about "peace." He is never willing to "tell fortunes" and say who will win or lose in the future. The reporter brought the question to the US election. He said that he can't see it now. According to custom, the Republican Party will hold a meeting in June and the Democratic Party will hold a meeting in July to nominate candidates before we can see the clues. He believes that Wallace, of the US Third Party, represents the revival of American isolationism. Wallace was born in Iowa, which is the agricultural society of the central United States. It is unfavorable to the world, especially to China, for an isolationist to hold office. He believes that Wallace will never be elected this year. Personally speaking, he does not want Wallace to be elected. He despises Wallace and despises the reappearance of isolationism in today's world.</p>
<p>Before he could finish speaking, a guest came to visit. Colleagues resigned and asked him, "Who will you vote for when you attend the National Congress this time?" He smiled and said, "I can't tell you. You should respect the opinions of our voters." The reporter then shook hands and said goodbye. (Its Rong)</p>

<h3>Yarn Control Committee Attaches Importance to Cotton Supply Problems; 300,000 Bales of American Cotton Have Been Ordered; The First Batch of 100,000 Bales Can Arrive by the End of Next Month</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] Chairman Yuan of the Yarn Control Committee replied to reporters' inquiries yesterday, saying: (1) The committee has recently focused on the supply of raw cotton, mainly foreign cotton, supplemented by domestic cotton. Recently, three batches of raw cotton have been ordered from the United States, totaling 300,000 bales. The first batch of 100,000 bales is expected to arrive in port in late April and early May. Regarding the purchase of domestic cotton, the Spinning Construction Company and cotton merchants have been entrusted to purchase it on behalf of the committee. Regarding the request of Hubei cotton merchants, the principle of entrusting them to purchase on behalf of the committee has been approved, and the procedures are being negotiated. (2) The detailed rules for the implementation of the entrusted spinning and weaving and the nine supplementary measures proposed by the six district guilds have been approved by the Ministry of Economic Affairs and can be implemented after the first batch of foreign cotton arrives in port. (3) It is rumored that in a month, Japanese yarn and cloth will be dumped in large quantities to Southeast Asia. Because its cost is lower, the committee will try to strengthen the export of cotton yarn in the future in order to win foreign markets and at the same time can use it to purchase raw cotton. Regarding the rumors that the committee will open up the transportation of yarn and cloth to the south, Chairman Yuan said that this is not the case. Regarding the rumors that more than a dozen Shanghai yarn factories will move to Hong Kong to set up factories, Chairman Yuan believes that although Hong Kong is a port for the import and export of goods in South China, the supply of raw materials is more convenient. However, Hong Kong's climate is not suitable for textiles, and transportation is difficult. The saying that factories will move is, in fact, still difficult and not easy to realize.</p>
<h3>Yarn Exchange for Printed Cotton: Export Association Actively Exports to China</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] Regarding the yarn exchange for printed cotton, the original exchange rate has been decided by the 12th Committee Meeting of the Export Association. Committee members Si Lu, Rong Yixin, Deputy Director Yuan Zhongkui, Chief Secretary Liu Jianhua, and Deputy Chief Secretary Song Lifeng are responsible for handling it. In order to ensure equal opportunities for all factories, it is specifically stipulated that factories that meet the export product standards should increase their exchange volume by one-third. The resulting cotton will be distributed to factories whose products do not meet export requirements, to demonstrate mutual cooperation. Secondly, each factory will exchange 10% of its total production volume with the Export Association for cotton. Because the existing cotton is not sufficient for the total exchange, it has been decided that exchanges of 500 bales or less will be honored in full, while exchanges of more than 500 bales will be allocated proportionally. In addition, the China Cotton Textile Joint Venture Company plans to exchange foreign exchange earned from exports with the Export Association for cotton yarn, and voluntarily relinquish the right to use 40% of the foreign exchange required by the Export Administration Committee to purchase raw materials. The Export Association has agreed, but the exchanged cotton yarn must be used for reproduction and limited to the equivalent raw materials required for exported finished products.</p>
<h3>Tight Credit, Stagnant Sales: Cotton Yarn Prices Steadily Decline, Fabric Sales Vigorous but Prices Continue to Fall</h3>
<p>Yesterday's cotton yarn market saw the release of yarn by the Textile Construction Company, leading to a significant increase in allocation. Credit became even tighter in the industry, and sales in the market were stagnant. Local transactions were also scarce, and market prices steadily declined.</p>
<p>The opening price of 42-count Blue Phoenix fine yarn immediately fell below the 200 million yuan mark, to 196 million yuan. Subsequently, the reproduction industry made up for the losses, and local entities also came to pull up the price, bringing it back to the 200 million yuan mark. However, it was only a fleeting moment, and the price fell again, closing at 176 million yuan, a drastic drop of 28 million yuan compared to the previous day.</p>
<p>The arbitrage trading of 21-count Double Horse yarn remained active, closing at 103 million yuan. However, actual sales of Double Horse yarn remained limited, with closing prices as low as 100.6 million yuan, a decrease of 9 million yuan compared to the previous day. In addition, 20-count yarns of various grades continued to fall by more than 10%, with most falling below the 100 million yuan mark. Coarse yarns such as 16-count and 10-count broke below the 90 million yuan mark, a drastic drop of about 12%.</p>
<p>Yesterday's cotton fabric market was affected by tight credit and lower prices in other regions, creating a price inversion. Customers frequently offered to sell, and although northern merchants were interested in purchasing, the exchange of foreign currency was slow, and remittance was difficult for financial institutions. As a result, there was a lack of momentum. Retailers and fabric merchants widely believed negative news, and competed to sell. The market was filled with selling pressure.</p>
<p>The opening price of 12-pound Dragon Head fine cloth immediately fell by 60,000 yuan, to 3.9 million yuan. Subsequently, sporadic demand improved slightly, and the market showed signs of recovery. However, the Shanxi merchants suddenly released a large amount of fabric, and merchants also sold off their holdings. Fabric stores cut prices significantly, and a selling frenzy erupted, causing the market price to fall again. Dragon Head fine cloth fell all the way to 3.83 million yuan. Around noon, northern merchants saw the low price and slightly increased their purchases, pushing the price back up to 3.95 million yuan. Later, news of the weak yarn market led to a small decline, closing at 3.89 million yuan, a decrease of 70,000 yuan compared to the previous day, but 190,000 yuan lower than the price outside the market.</p>
<p>The prices of other grades of fine cloth also declined by 20,000 to 100,000 yuan. Four Gentlemen tribute cloth and serge were sold off in large quantities, falling by about 200,000 yuan. In addition, the prices of bleached cloth, coarse cloth, colored cloth, and Shilin cloth all fell by 100,000 to 200,000 yuan.</p>
<p>In addition, it was reported that Double Flying Dragon fine cloth sold by the Textile Construction Company the day before was sold at a loss of 140,000 yuan, with a transaction price of 3.48 million yuan. The price temporarily recovered to break even, but ultimately still required a loss of 70,000 to 80,000 yuan to attract buyers. It is said that most of the buyers were arbitrageurs.</p>
<p>Textile Construction Company Sells Yarn</p>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] Yesterday, the Textile Construction Company sold 10 types of cotton yarn as usual, with a total of 239 applications for 670 pieces, equivalent to 953.5 pieces of 20-count yarn.</p>
<p>The opening prices of each yarn were as follows: 20-count Heavenly Maiden 92 million yuan, 6-count Sub-Sunlight 53 million yuan, 8-count Sunlight 55 million yuan, 10-count Yang Crane 57 million yuan, 32-count Fairy Peach 125 million yuan, 40-count Sunlight 142 million yuan, 40-count Tk Color Ball 183 million yuan, 42-count Double Strand Precious Light 166 million yuan, 60-count Sunlight 222 million yuan, 60-count Double Strand Singed 320 million yuan.</p>

<p>(2) Current Status of China's Electrochemical Industry: The electrochemical factories in China that are currently in operation include Tianyuan Electrochemical Factory, Taiwan Alkali Industry Company, Shanghai Dazhong Electrochemical Factory, Jiangnan Electrochemical Factory, Zhongguang Electrochemical Factory, Liuhe Electrochemical Factory, Huachang Electrochemical Factory, Tianjin Chemical Industry Factory, Shenyang Northeast Chemical Factory, and Qingdao Zhongfang Chemical Factory, among others. The maximum production capacity can reach 915 tons per month, and the current monthly production is about 650 tons. The alkaline water produced by the alkalization of soda ash is not included.</p>
<p>(3) Current Difficulties: (1) The electrochemical factories in Shanghai developed significantly during the Anti-Japanese War. After the victory, due to the influx of imported goods, most of them switched to other industries, and it is difficult to recover in the short term. (2) Shanghai lacks sufficient electricity, and electrodes are not easy to purchase, so it is difficult to set up electrochemical factories.</p>
<p>(4) Promotion Methods: (1) Stipulate incentives for establishing electrochemical factories in Taiwan, and allow the import of new electrochemical machinery. (2) Provide convenience for electrochemical factories in Shanghai that are preparing to resume production to connect to electricity.</p>
<p>(5) Expected Results: (1) Establish an electrochemical factory in Taiwan that can produce 2,000 tons of caustic soda per month within three years. (2) The electrochemical factories in Shanghai that have not resumed production, such as Tiantai Chemical Factory, etc., can continuously produce within one year.</p>
<h3>Approved Import Permits Announced but Goods Not Yet Picked Up After Arrival</h3>
<p>Import and Export Association Requests Early Resolution</p>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] The goods of various importers in this city, which arrived with import permits issued before the announcement, have not been picked up to this day due to problems with letters of credit and foreign exchange. The goods arrived before the end of last year, and are all domestic materials and industrial raw materials that are lacking, and already have legal pre-announcement permits. The Import and Export Association of this city believes that the importers are suffering great losses due to the long-term suspension, and has sent a telegram to the Central Bank requesting that for letters of credit with pre-announcement import permits opened by importers, the foreign exchange that has already been used should be compensated to the designated bank in legal tender at the current listed exchange rate, with the difference between the exchange rate at the time of opening the letter of credit and the exchange rate at the time the letter of credit was used, which would then be transferred to the national bank as compensation, so that they could be notified by the Alkali Administration Committee to endorse the pickup of the goods, so that the pending case could be resolved as soon as possible.</p>
<p>China Trust Business Meeting Concludes</p>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] The China Trust Bureau held a business meeting from the 19th of this month, and completed the review of proposals from various groups yesterday (the 24th) morning. At 3 p.m., Director Wu Rencang presided over the general meeting, and announced the adjournment after the proposals were passed.</p>
<h3>This Year's Agricultural Loan Quota for Zhejiang Province is 1 Trillion</h3>
<p>Guan Longsun, manager of the Zhejiang branch of the Farmers Bank, recently went to Beijing to attend a bank affairs meeting. After the meeting, he came to Shanghai and said that the agricultural loan quota for the region is 1.005 trillion yuan. The Cooperative Treasury accounts for more than 340 billion yuan, and our bank accounts for more than 650 billion yuan. Loans of 69 billion yuan were issued in March, focusing on increasing grain and cotton production. The next priorities are tea, silk, fisheries, and land finance. According to the actual needs of this region, at least 3 trillion yuan are needed this year. The current figure is only more than 600 billion yuan, which is a large discrepancy from the original plan. However, we will still do our best to implement national policies. The organizational foundation of farmers in this region is relatively solid, and there are no major difficulties in the agricultural work.</p>
<h3>Tea Market Remains Firm</h3>
<p>The tea market, which had just stabilized, once again saw a strong surge in prices yesterday. The reason for this is that after foreign tea was favored by French Belgian, the purchasing enthusiasm of exporters was strong, and they competed to purchase it. As for domestic sales of fancy teas, various parts of the country are also inquiring about them, but the market inventory has not increased, and there is still some time before the new season. Therefore, the sellers are determined to hold on to their stock and are unwilling to part with it. This creates a situation where demand exceeds supply. Although transactions are mediocre, the market sentiment is gradually improving, and the foundation is very solid.</p>
<h3>Taiwan Sugar Allocation Price Increased: Generally Increased by 550,000 per Dan</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] The sugar subgroup of the Price Evaluation Council of this city held its 24th evaluation meeting at the Social Affairs Bureau yesterday afternoon. Because Taiwan Sugar's costs have increased, the exchange rate of legal tender is frequently adjusted, and because the difference between the Taiwan Sugar allocation price and the market price is too large, merchants are competing to obtain it, resulting in fraudulent activities. Therefore, it was decided to increase the allocation price to bring it closer to the market price, so that such corrupt practices would not occur.</p>
<p>The meeting decided to increase the allocation price of Taiwan Sugar Company's 13th phase, as follows, with a general increase of 550,000 yuan per dan compared to the previous phase.</p>
<p>The allocation price per dan is: Special Grade Granulated White, 4.25 million yuan, Grade 1 Granulated White, 4.1 million yuan, Grade 2 Granulated White, 3.95 million yuan, Grade 3 Granulated White, 3.65 million yuan, Brown Sugar, 3.8 million yuan, Taiwan Green Sugar, 3.5 million yuan, Special Grade Cotton White, 4.35 million yuan, Grade 1 Cotton White, 4.2 million yuan, Grade 2 Cotton White, 4.05 million yuan, Rock Sugar, 5.8 million yuan.</p>
<p>The evaluation council also decided that the evaluation council will be changed to meet once a week in the future (previously once every two weeks), and the payment deadline for sugar allocation will also be shortened.</p>
<p>Marked Down</p>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market saw the price fixed by the Taiwan company, and they decided to adjust it. Green, red, and white sugar increased by 550,000 yuan, and rock sugar increased by 700,000 yuan. However, because the money supply was incredibly tight, and the actual sales didn't improve, the association's allocation was reduced instead of increased. For example, the current price for the 24th raw white was between 4.7 million and 4.68 million yuan, decreased by 150,000 to 160,000. The price for half white was even, the bag packaging was 5.1 million yuan, and the grass packaging was 4.9 million. The price for 20 medium granulated white was also reduced by 100,000 yuan, to between 4.17 million and 4.2 million. The direct delivery of Taiwan red was only 4 million yuan. In the afternoon, the trading price on the order form dropped by 100,000 to 200,000 yuan.</p>
<p>The volume of native sugar transactions was very low, and the price fell again. The price for Shantou green was between 2.98 million yuan and 2.96 million yuan, a small decrease of 30,000 to 40,000 yuan. The price for Xinghua white was 4.45 million yuan, and the price for Xinghua red was 3 million yuan, decreased by 50,000 each. The price for Diao green was 2.7 million yuan, a small decrease of 100,000 yuan. The price for Hainan red was 2.2 million yuan, a small decrease of 80,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>National Bank to Provide Overdrafts for Agricultural Loans This Month: One-Month Term, 4% Interest</h3>
<p>This year's agricultural loan is 15 trillion yuan, and it is decided to be issued in installments. The total amount of loans in March, excluding Taiwan, is 14.75 trillion yuan. Li Shuming, general manager of the Agricultural Bank, came to Shanghai yesterday to discuss the matter of re-mortgage with the Central Bank. It is reported that as a result of the consultation with Deputy Governor Liu, in order to save time, it was decided to allocate funds by overdraft first, and then handle the re-mortgage next month. The overdraft term is limited to one month, and the monthly interest rate is 4%. The amount allocated to each district and branch will be notified by the Central Bank to each branch for local allocation. The overdraft will be paid in full, and the re-mortgage will be processed at 90% of the value.</p>
<h3>People's Livelihood Adjustment Council Sells Rice, Applications are Scarce: Actual Rice Sales Remain Stagnant, White Japonica Rice Slightly Rises by Several Tens of Thousands of Yuan in North and South Markets Yesterday</h3>
<p>The rice market rose slightly after falling. After falling for two consecutive days, the price was already very low, and there was a price inversion with the production area. The owners were unwilling to sell at low prices due to cost considerations, so they started to hold up the prices. However, sales were still not active, so although it was said to have risen, the actual increase was very small.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the market, the owners wanted to reverse the decline and raised the price by 100,000 yuan. However, because actual sales remained stagnant, the price fell back, and the result was only an increase of 50,000 yuan. The closing price of white japonica rice in the northern market was 3.8 million yuan, and the closing price of special high japonica rice was 3.95 million yuan. The price of Bo Dao rice rose more. The People's Livelihood Adjustment Council opened the sale of early rice at 3.4 million yuan, but there were not many buyers.</p>
<p>The price of flour fell first and then rose back, and the result was a slight increase. The market continued to decline at the beginning, following the previous decline. The opening price of Lao Che flour was only 1.45 million yuan. The low price attracted purchases, and sales had been on the sidelines for many days. The closing price rose back to 1.475 million yuan, the same as the previous day. The closing price of Bingchuan was 1.165 million yuan. Hongfeng Jiancheng, under the competition of retail investors, was even higher than the previous day by 10,000 to 15,000 yuan. The price of bran rose back to 800,500 yuan.</p>
<p>For miscellaneous grains, due to the continuing tight money supply, owners were eager to sell. Actual sales and customers rarely inquired. The initial price of Hankou Zha beans was 1.8 million yuan. The closing price of slightly inferior beans was 1.75 million yuan, a decrease of 100,000 yuan. The sale of corn was stagnant, and the price of high-quality goods was weak by 30,000 to 50,000 yuan. The price of green beans continued to fall by 50,000 yuan. Customers did not inquire about red sorghum, and the price fell back by 30,000 to 40,000 yuan. The price of sesame fell by 100,000 yuan. Guangdong merchants did not purchase raw peanuts, and the price also fell by 100,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Due to the increasing tight money supply, owners of edible oil were eager to sell, and oil mills also opened sales. The opening price of soybean oil from the Dayou factory was 7.47 million yuan, and the price of recycled oil was as low as 7.45 million yuan. The prices of other soybean oils were as low as 7.4 million yuan, a decrease of 100,000 yuan each. The arrival of raw oil increased slightly, and there were many sellers. The price of Qingdao Ji barrel raw oil fell below 9 million yuan, a decrease of 200,000 yuan. The price of raw rapeseed oil fell by more than 100,000 yuan. The price of Xiaoche sesame oil initially fell slightly and then rose, and the result was an increase of 100,000 yuan. Under the excessive supply of soybean cake, the price fell by 20,000 to 30,000 yuan. The Zhongzhi factory opened many ZZZ brand cakes.</p>
<h3>England Plans to Increase Purchases of Tung Oil, Silk, Sesame and Eggs in China</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Economic Affairs recently approved a telegram from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, stating that the British Consulate in London had received a letter from Mr. Gilbert, an official of the British Ministry of Commerce: In order to balance Sino-British trade, the United Kingdom plans to increase its purchases of several commodities in China, such as eggs, oilseeds, tung oil, vegetable oil, raw silk, super waste silk, dry cocoons, and ramie. If our country can increase the export volume of the above-mentioned commodities to the United Kingdom, it will be beneficial to the development of trade between the two countries. After receiving the telegram, the Ministry of Economic Affairs immediately sent telegrams to the relevant competent authorities to investigate the possible increase in the export volume of commodities to the United Kingdom, so as to verify the reply.</p>
<p>Soap Prices Decline</p>
<p>In the daily necessities soap market, the prices opened higher in the morning, with strong purchasing interest from fellow merchants and vigorous efforts to raise prices. However, because cigarette prices fell back, floating investors sold off to take profits. As a result, Guben soap had ample supply due to distribution arrangements, and fell all the way to a low price of 5.75 million yuan at the close, a drastic drop of 130,000 yuan per box compared to the previous day. Arrow brand soap also fell by 70,000 yuan, to 5.45 million yuan. The prices of other soaps, such as Guanghua, Meili, and Xiangmao, also fell back by 100,000 to 200,000 yuan and 50,000 yuan respectively.</p>
<p>In the match market, Meili old brand matches were more actively sold and rose by 200,000 yuan. There were different opinions on new brand matches, and the prices fluctuated.</p>
<p>In the kerosene market, under the control of tight credit, wholesale transactions among fellow merchants were very limited. Those with tight funds even sold off their holdings, and the price fell again. The price of Gao Du barreled kerosene fell to 18.5 million yuan, a decrease of 500,000 yuan. Mobil canned oil was traded at around 2 million yuan, and the retail price was 45,000 to 46,000 yuan per can. The price limit was still 33,000 yuan per catty. Candles were stable, and the price did not rise or fall.</p>
<p>Cigarette Prices Weaken</p>
<p>Yesterday's cigarette market initially saw some purchases from retailers who saw low prices. The price of Ten Branches Great Britain rose to 98 million yuan, and Old Knife rose above 80 million yuan, to 80.5 million yuan. Later, it was heard that the prices of non-industry goods were still weak, and the industry's money supply was becoming increasingly tight due to the continuous distribution of goods by manufacturers. A large number of goods were sold off at high prices.</p>
<p>In the afternoon, goods from fellow merchants in other regions were continuously dumped, and the market became even weaker. At the end, the price of Ten Branches Great Britain fell back to 94 million yuan at the close, a decrease of 2.5 million yuan compared to the previous day. Old Knife closed at a low price of 76 million yuan, a decrease of 2 million yuan.</p>
<p>The sales of other Chinese merchant cigarettes were stagnant, and the prices also fell by 2,000 to 3,000 yuan to 10,000 yuan. However, brands such as "Brandy Shipowner Crusader" still felt resilient. In addition, the American goods strip cigarettes and fifty-branch cigarettes also weakened.</p>
<h3>Domestic Exchange Rate Correction</h3>
<p>The domestic exchange rates of the four banks, two bureaus, and one treasury have recently been revised as follows: Xiamen 180 yuan, Quanzhou 180 yuan, Guangzhou 180 yuan, Haikou 200 yuan, Nanchang Changsha Hengyang 100 yuan each, Zhabu 20 yuan, Hankou Wuchang 120 yuan each, Chongqing Chengdu 40 yuan each, Wanxian 150 yuan, Ganzhou 120 yuan.</p>
<h3>Chinese Stocks Weaken in the Morning Session, Slight Turnaround in the Afternoon</h3>
<p>Chinese stocks were forced to fall yesterday morning due to the expiration of contracts, the decline in non-industry prices due to excess inventory, and the rise in Hong Kong electricity. The afternoon saw a strong rebound, and prices suddenly rose near the close.</p>
<p>The market opened weakly due to the continued impact of the US loan. Yongsheng opened at 1,790 yuan and 1,760 yuan. It then fell to 1,750 yuan and 1,775 yuan, and then rose to 1,760 yuan and 1,795 yuan. At this point, there were more supplies for sale, and the price moved downward again. Before filling empty positions, it rebounded to 1,745 yuan and 1,775 yuan. Many sold at high prices. Liquidity remained tight. Non-industry materials fell. Excess holdings crashed. Xinyi was forced to stop trading. Yongsheng fell to the low prices of 1,650 yuan and 1,685 yuan. The closing price of immediate delivery shares was 1,652 yuan, and Xinyi also recovered a bit. Compared to the previous closing, Xinhua, Qinxing, Xinyi, Jinglun, Zhongsi, and Rongfeng fell by one-tenth. Yongsheng Commerce, Beihu, Tongyi, Xinguang Matches, Guohuo, Xinhua, Yonggong, Liann NeiYi, and Zhongni fell by one-half. The remaining shares fell only slightly. Transfer shares of Xinhua and Qinxing fell by one-tenth, Yongsheng Xinguang fell by one-half, and Jingfu slightly copied.</p>
<p>Subsequent futures trading was suspended, as usual. Immediate settlement shares started at 1,690 yuan, from 1,680 yuan and were then taken up to 1,720 yuan. Rumors of foreign exchange rate adjustment and industrial loans helped generate momentum, and shares rose to 1,745 yuan. Prices for Hong Kong power were high, and prices then dropped again to 1,715 yuan. No. 119 and others moved up to purchase, and the National Bank was limited in purchase. Shares rose to 1,760 yuan. No. 143, No. 156, and No. 190 were sold off but there was struggling. Many investors shorted Jingfu, and they have exceeded Xinguang. The close was 1,757 yuan. Compared to the closing in the morning, immediate delivery shares, Zhabei, Yongsheng, Rongfeng, DaTong, Xinhua, Xinguang, Yonggong, Jingfu NeiYi, and Guohuo rose by one-half. Xinhua, Qinxing, and Jingfu rose by one-tenth. Huaxin fell by one-half. Remaining stocks only rose slightly. Off-market, unlisted stocks were all listless.</p>
<h3>National Bonds Fall Back, Foreign Stocks Flat and Weak</h3>
<p>Government bonds fell quite a bit yesterday. The maintenance efforts of small investors were ineffective. The 500 office sold off. Trading totaled 3 million. Tongbing opened at 106,000 yuan, and fell to 90,000 yuan. Then it became more settled. Compared to the previous closing, A and B bonds fell by 9,000 yuan, C bonds fell by 18,000 yuan, D bonds fell by 10,000 yuan, and E bonds fell by 11,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Foreign stocks were unaffected by the stimulating effect of high Hong Kong power prices. With the exception of shipping, which held steady, all others failed to hold their ground. Security companies and small investors sold off. Foreign firms picked up a few. Yisha opened in the morning at 1.715 million yuan, and closed the day from 1.76 million, declining to within 1.7 million. Rubber stocks, steel industry and telephone all traded evenly compared to previous closings. Shipping stock was slightly higher. British Consolidated fell by one-half. Others all declined slightly.</p>
<h3>Hong Kong Gold and Exchange Rates</h3>
<p>[United Press Hong Kong, 24th] The opening prices in the Hong Kong gold and exchange open market on the 24th were as follows: Gold 330 Hong Kong dollars per tael, US dollars 5.72 Hong Kong dollars per dollar, British pounds 13 Hong Kong dollars per pound, National currency 1.0 million Hong Kong dollars 12.7 Hong Kong dollars.</p>

<h3>Authorities Strictly Prohibit Silver from Flowing into Communist Areas</h3>
<p>The Ministry of National Defense, in view of the large-scale looting of gold and silver dollars by the Communist bandits in Henan, requires all local people who have been kidnapped to be redeemed with gold and silver dollars. A month ago, each silver dollar sold for as much as 300,000 yuan in Xincai County, and the price in Xinyang, Hankou, and other places was as high as 130,000 to 140,000 yuan. Therefore, the free areas often discover smugglers transporting gold and silver dollars to the bandit areas. The ministry yesterday specifically notified the police bureau of this city to reiterate the ban (i.e., the measures for traffic and economic blockade against the bandit areas promulgated on January 9, 1947, and the measures for prohibiting the transportation of goods to the bandit areas promulgated on March 12, 1947) to strictly restrict the inflow of gold and silver into the bandit areas, and ordered that all provinces, counties, cities, townships, and towns connected to the bandit areas be prohibited from using silver dollars. Those who violate the order will be confiscated and confiscated. It is learned that the police bureau will strengthen the inspection of illegal shops selling gold and silver starting from today.</p>
<h3>Silkworm Seed Pricing and Loans: Silk Association Proposes Measures to the Ministry</h3>
<p>The Silk Association held a meeting on the 22nd to discuss the regulations for silkworm seed prices and the approval of loan methods. It was resolved to submit the following key points to the Ministry for approval and implementation:</p>
<p>(1) The amount of the loan will be approved based on the equipment of various farms and the quality of the seeds. The grading will be detailed based on the silkworm farmers' breeding performance, and will be divided into four levels. The first level of loan will be approved at 80% of the production cost. The second level will be 70%, the third level will be 60%, and the fourth level will be 50%.</p>
<p>(2) The price of seeds will be determined according to the actual production cost required at the time of pricing, excluding the increase in prices and differences obtained through loans, plus interest and profits. However, the production cost of silkworm seeds will be calculated according to the first level. The calculation of interest will be based on the actual interest rate of the loan bank for the loan portion. The working capital portion of various farms will be calculated at 15%. The profit is set at 20% of the production cost.</p>
<p>(3) The government has the right to purchase or not. The government may purchase according to the stipulated price, or not purchase. However, when purchasing, the proportion of the actual loan amount to the production cost shall not exceed the first level.</p>
<p>(4) The purchase and distribution of silkworm seeds shall be handled by the China Silkworm Company in conjunction with the China Agricultural Bank, and may entrust local governments or silkworm improvement institutions and organizations to directly distribute silkworm seeds.</p>
<p>(5) The evaluation of silkworm seeds, the investigation and calculation of silkworm seed production costs, the evaluation of the equipment of various farms, the quality of silkworm seeds, and the breeding of silkworm seeds, etc., shall be discussed by the Silk Association by inviting relevant agencies and hiring experts to form a subcommittee, and then submitted to the association for decision.</p>
<h3>Approved Import of Japanese Repatriated Goods Exempt from All Taxes and Duties</h3>
<p>The Industry and Commerce Guidance Office recently received a letter from the Japanese Reparations Committee stating that the committee had previously submitted a request to the Executive Yuan for approval to exempt all customs duties and local taxes on the import of Japanese reparations. Because Japanese repatriated goods are now being returned by ships carrying reparations, and the repatriated goods are also different from ordinary imported goods because they were robbed by Japan during the war, the committee intends to request that all taxes and duties be exempted in accordance with the import regulations for reparations, and that the general import permits for reparations be used to facilitate transportation. It is learned that the case has also been approved by the Executive Yuan and has been forwarded to the Ministry of Finance and the Export Administration Committee for compliance.</p>

<h3>A Brief Discussion of Evaluating Ancient Sounds</h3>
<p>— Yu Min</p>
<p>Authored by Lu Zhiwei, published in October of the 36th year by Harvard-Yenching Institute</p>
<p>After a field of study has reached a considerable level of development, further progress often depends on two forces: first, the discovery of new materials; second, even if the materials are the same old things, there is a new perspective or viewpoint on them. Since Bernhard Karlgren led the study of Chinese phonology, there have been criticisms and corrections of his work, but most of them are minor modifications. In terms of viewpoints, even the most absurd ones, I haven't seen anyone who doesn't follow him. For example, Lu Fayan divided many rhymes very finely and said, "Yin, Jia is the same as Zi, Yi is the same as Chou, but now they are all different." His intention was simply to divide them into three categories, allowing Jia to rhyme Zi and Yin together, and Yi to rhyme Chou and Yin together, so that anyone could use his book. This does not represent Jia's language, nor does it represent Yi's language. Although Jia and Yi's languages are different, they both have two categories. This is not difficult to understand, but I have never seen anyone challenge Karlgren's "Chang'an Mandarin of about 600 years"! The author of this book has several different viewpoints from Karlgren, so the results are not within Karlgren's scope. These points are where the author excels, and it is where he pushes phonology forward from Jiang Youhao and Bernhard Karlgren. For example, based on the Qieyun fragments where Han, Huan, Ge, and Ge do not rhyme, canceling Karlgren's distinction between the two closed-mouth rhymes is not the author's forte.</p>
<p>In Chen Feng's Qieyun Examination, in the throat, teeth, and lip sounds of the rhymes Zhi, Zhi, Ji, Zhen, Xian, Xiao, Geng, Qing, Qin, and Yan, there are repeated small rhymes, and the Rhyme Mirror and Seven Sound Chart also list them separately. However, Karlgren and Bai Dizhou, who boasted of "statistics," all dismissed this phenomenon with a single stroke. The author does not do that: he establishes his set of pure sounds and a set of labialized throat and teeth sounds based on this! (See page 10 of the original book). This not only explains the mysterious Four Tones, Five Sounds, and Nine Melodies of the anti-clockwise diagram of the "He Wo..." as throat sounds and "Geng Ying..." as teeth sounds very well, but also helps the author to derive several important results. First, from the transformation of "Xu Ju Zang" to "Xiang Chuang Zhuang" and "Yu Wu Fu" to "Wang Wang Fang," it seems like the Yu rhyme opens and closes. The author used this sharp tool to prove it (pages 59, 158). Second, he clarified the conditions for the occurrence of light lip sounds in modern dialects (page 62). Third, he explained the origins of the You rhyme, the Wu third grade, and the Dong third grade in the Zhi and Zheng divisions, which Li Fangui and Bernhard Karlgren had been arguing about, very clearly (pages 110 and following): this is the author's greatest contribution. Speaking of the author's strengths, it is simply not ignoring the phenomenon of repeated throat and teeth sounds. Previous people, except for Mr. Zhang Taiyan, who discussed it slightly from the perspective of etymology in the Theory of Sound, have all ignored it.</p>
<p>The preface to the Qieyun says, "Xian, Xian, You, and Hou are all discussed with the same cut." People have always thought that he was talking about rhymes. Zeng Yungan only began to believe that he was referring to the sound nodes. The author used statistical methods to separate the broad and narrow sounds of Qing from Xin (some exceptions are due to the characters Zi and Qi being too easy to write and having nothing to do with the sounds). Therefore, he smoothly canceled the -i- medial sound that Karlgren added to the pure fourth-grade rhyme, disregarding Japanese transliterations (page 6). He also used this method to determine the articulation position of Zhuang, Chu, Chuang, and Shan to be the same as Zhao, Chuan, Shen, and Shen, but added labialization, so he explained very clearly how the second-grade Yang rhyme changes from open to closed mouth in modern dialects (page 17).</p>
<p>The preface to the Qieyun also has the sentence "In Qin and Long, the departing tone is used for people." The author uses it to explain why Ji, Tai, and Fei do not combine with Zhi, Dai, and Shi: it is simply to allow the people of Qin and Long to still rhyme with Fang and Mo Wu! Turning magic into rottenness is quite straightforward! (Page 196)</p>
<p>The qualitative analysis of the Qieyun itself and the relationship between rhyme categories have never been thoroughly organized. The author uses qualitative research to find out that the vowels of Qin and Zheng are the same as Zhen and Yuan (page 56), and that the ancient vowels of the Xian rhyme cannot be X (page 221), which are all good examples, and future researchers can make more use of them.</p>
<p>According to the reviewer's personal opinion, there are still several areas in the author's opinions that need further discussion. First: the people of the late Zhou dynasty may have already dropped -d-g in their dialects. If this view is accepted, the discussions on pages 102, 151, and 245 of the original book can save a lot of effort.</p>
<p>Second, the author believes that the entering tones of ancient times and the Six Dynasties were all stopped without breaking the sound (page 133), but the entering tones of the Zhou and Qin people transformed with the rising tones, while the rising tones of the Six Dynasties people did not rhyme. The author did not explain this phenomenon.</p>
<p>Third, the author believes that there was a fifth tone in ancient times, which is generally credible. However, believing that the relationship between the fifth tone with tongue-end sounds and the level, rising, and departing tones is different from the relationship between the fifth tone with tongue-root sounds and the level, rising, and departing tones is purely a matter of tone shape (page 200), which is a bit dangerous. Because in that case, the level, rising, and departing tones themselves must seem very similar, so they can be separated from the fifth tone and the entering tone, but at the same time, they are clearly divided into three categories and do not mix, which is really too difficult to confirm, and it seems that we still need to consider it carefully. Any one of these points is a good topic for future discussion.</p>
<p>Finally, the author's assignment of no sounds to the repeated second-grade rhymes Shan, Shan, Xian, and Xian is determined by the proximity of harmonics. Xian and Shan are a because they are close to Tan and Han (pages 36, 40). However, compared to the Geng and Geng rhymes, Geng is still closer to Tang, but it is ordered as Geng a and Geng a (page 45), which seems inconsistent. The author also did not explain.</p>
<p>The author's corrections to Karlgren are indeed much more progressive. In particular, the absence of five types of og in ancient sounds makes people feel relieved. However, looking at the ancient sounds of the two families, they are still unlike the sound system of any living language today.</p>
<p>However, this is all limited by the materials. The vowels determined by the author, the w of the You division and the A of the Xiao division, are all limited by the surrounding divisions. The so-called "its holding is justified, its words are reasoned" is also true. Generally speaking, the materials in the books can be said to have been completely utilized by the author. The materials in the books can be used to find "categories," but it is difficult to use them to find "values." For example, in the English Vowel Shift, the categories are completely unchanged, and none of the values are unchanged. Therefore, the ancient sounds of the author and Karlgren are similar to the Qieyun sounds, which is exactly the reason. In the future, people who want to make further progress should find a way out in dialects and Tibetan-Tai languages.</p>
<p>To read this book, it is best to first compare the Qieyun Examination, Rhyme Mirror, and Chapter 3 of Volume 1 of Karlgren's book, then read Volume 3 of Karlgren's book, then read Jiang Yougao's book, then read the introduction to the categories of Chinese words, and then read this book, which can save a lot of effort, and it can be completed in just one or two months. There is nothing mysterious in it. It is simply that some people ignore this preparatory work and say that this book is difficult to understand.</p>
<h3>English Prose Since 1939</h3>
<p>— Shao Xunmei</p>
<p>Prose Literature Since 1939. By</p>
<p>John Hayward.</p>
<p>The British Council. 1947. 53. pp</p>
<p>New Writing, No. 29. Edited by</p>
<p>John Lehmann.</p>
<p>Penguin Books Ltd. 186 pp.</p>
<p>The characteristics of the British are thoroughness, composure, planning, perseverance, love of tradition, and the ability to cope with difficult environments. In World War II, they showed this significantly; strong evidence can also be found in their wartime literary scene.</p>
<p>The "British Council" sponsors many publications. The "Oxford World Affairs Pamphlets" are praised for helping their own people understand the situation of related countries; the "Britain in Pictures" series helps foreigners understand Britain; and the "British Art and Artists" series is entirely about literature and art.</p>
<p>About ten books in the last series have already been published. It divides various arts into categories and is written by famous authors or experts in each field. Except for "Scottish Art," "The Voice of Wales," and "British Architecture," the titles of several other types, such as dance, poetry, fiction, film, painting, music, and drama, all begin with the words "Since 1939." Therefore, the scope of the content is limited to the facts and circumstances of the five or six years from the outbreak of the war to the end of the war.</p>
<p>Recently, we read "Prose Since 1939." The author, John Hayward, is a famous literary critic. During the war, he was in charge of introducing new books at the British Information Service. Of course, he was more familiar with the literary scene at that time than others; therefore, it was indeed very suitable for him to write this book. The content of this book includes biographies, reviews, research, and documentary essays. The scope of novels is too broad and the number is too large, so Henry Reed wrote "Fiction Since 1939" separately and published it separately, so it is rare to mention it in this book.</p>
<p>The book has seven chapters. The first chapter is the preface. In just nine pages of text, it describes the general situation of writers and publishers during the war very clearly. Even the ideological changes at the time and possible future trends are analyzed considerably. I have said before that thoroughness, composure, planning, and the ability to cope with the environment are also characteristics of the British; therefore, when the war began, the whole country mobilized, and famous writers and scholars were conscripted. Everyone felt that this war was the final decision between justice and power, humanity and ambition—a confirmation of concepts: therefore, propaganda offensive and defensive were equally important. Some of these writers and scholars served in the Information Service or public cultural organizations, directly using the tools they were familiar with. Some also participated in the defense work in the rear. In fact, very few were on the front line.</p>
<p>However, this does not mean that they can have enough time and leisure to engage in their original writing. On the one hand, they all have designated official duties; on the other hand, it is very difficult to collect materials, and it is even more difficult to organize thoughts. Therefore, unless they have made considerable preparations in advance, they can only write some short things, occasional inspirations, or fragments of thoughts, and submit them to magazines and newspapers for publication. Pure literary magazines such as "Horizon" and "New Writing" are the two most valued publications. They maintain intellectual contact with the continent. The former tries to introduce French works as much as possible, and the latter focuses more on the translation of new works in Central Europe and the Balkan countries. British literature and art have always relied on the source of the continent for cultivation, constantly receiving the infusion of new life. They shouldered this traditional responsibility. The latest issue received is the 29th issue, which translates poems and essays from France, Poland, and the Czech Republic. There is also a comparative study of English and French painters. The most important is the analysis of T.S. Eliot's new poem "Four Quartets," which is a great help for domestic and foreign readers to understand Eliot's poems. From this, we can see how indispensable it was as a cultural medium during the war.</p>
<p>Another thing that affected the writing community was the restriction and rationing of paper. Especially publishers who were already established before the war were subject to stricter restrictions. With less paper supply, they had to consider the Zhengjun's opinions before publishing books. There must be a proper distribution of reprints of classic works and publications of modern famous writers. However, the number of readers is increasing day by day. They have more time at home; there are fewer places for entertainment outside; the satisfaction gained from movies and radio broadcasts is not as profound as that of books; therefore, the demand for books far exceeds the quantity that the publishing industry can supply. In this difficult environment, there are still some new writers who meet the world, and we have to admire the ability and hard work of the publishers.</p>
<p>Chapters 2 to 6 evaluate prose by category according to its nature. Of course, this book should focus on literature, art, and academics; however, history, politics, religion, philosophy, and science, all works that can influence the formation of thought, have accurate judgments and concise introductions.</p>
<p>Among prose works, biographies and autobiographies are the most popular. Analyzed, it is nothing more than the manifestation of their love of traditional characteristics; and most readers can temporarily escape from the iron fist of war and steal some leisure. They can long for the happy and magnificent world of the past. If it is a history of poverty and terror, then they can also use it to comfort themselves, saying that this world is inherently painful; and encourage themselves to endure and fight with courage and perseverance like our ancestors.</p>
<p>The invention of science and the application of atomic bombs have certainly affected people's religious beliefs. However, there are also many facts that cannot be explained by materialistic theories. There is indeed a superhuman will in the universe. Philosophers and writers continue to seek truth in religion. The poet Eliot, relying on the most orthodox Catholicism, pointed out common mistakes and regarded religion as a request for the extension of physical welfare in the spiritual world. The novelist Huxley, hiding in the suburbs of Hollywood, went to study esoteric teachings and even preached on the small mountain, advocating the so-called new Brahmanism.</p>
<p>The last chapter is the conclusion, pointing out the crisis in the literary and artistic circles. Because the economic power of movies and radio broadcasts will encourage popular and low-level works; profound academic pursuits will decrease with general needs, or retreat into a narrow circle. This is originally a global cultural crisis, and we can also use it as a warning.</p>
<h3>Writing Before the Publication of the [Art Yearbook]</h3>
<p>— Jiang Xiyi</p>
<p>Edited and printed by the Shanghai Art Tea Party, published in mid-April</p>
<p>China has been in a time of trouble for the past fifty years. Art is a reflection of the nation's culture and the vitality of its life, and its importance cannot be ignored. The government has always been busy saving the country, maintaining law and order, and improving people's livelihoods. Fortunately, art is not a top priority, and it seems to be irrelevant to welfare. It has always been left to its own devices, and it can be dispensable. Most people in society are immersed in wealth and profit, and they have their own views on spiritual issues. In the eyes of the general public, art is just a decoration, or even a luxury. The fate of Chinese art, which has a history of thousands of years, is almost unimaginable. I remember that Mr. Cai Yuanpei first advocated aesthetic education. After the first National Art Exhibition was held in the Republic of China in 1929, the Nanjing National Art Museum was established in 1937, and the Theater and Conservatory of Music were completed in sequence. The Ministry of Education then held the Second National Art Exhibition and published a special collection. Until now, no one has ever mentioned the Art Yearbook. A friend told me that Mr. Huang Binhong had the motivation to compile the Art Yearbook very early, but it was never realized. Someone said that it is a shame that the Chinese art world does not have an Art Yearbook! And it is also a shame for the country! If this is really the case, it is really not easy to run an Art Yearbook. If it is not compiled well, wouldn't it be adding shame to shame and humiliation to humiliation? However, it seems that knowing the difficulty and not retreating is the attitude that one should have when doing something. Otherwise, no one will ever do what is difficult, and wouldn't there be a day when there would be no success? It seems that shame and humiliation should be another matter.</p>
<p>Looking at the spirit of valuing art in countries such as ancient Greece, India, Europe, America, and Japan, and the fact that all of them have yearbooks and the like that are published regularly, their role and value in communicating culture, promoting national essence, and international cultural exchanges are undeniable. The fact that China lacks this kind of thing is also a fact. The thirty years of the Republic of China is a short process in history. We cannot have excessive expectations for art in this extremely short process, but the achievements of art works in the past thirty years are also not to be underestimated. Shanghai is the center of the country's economy and culture, and it is a gathering place for human resources. In terms of art groups alone, there are several, such as the Chinese Painting Society, the Calligraphers Association, the Women's Painting and Calligraphy Society, the Art Tea Party, and the Art Association founded by the Central Cultural Movement Committee. Among them, the Art Tea Party was established the shortest time, but it has the largest number of members, about 2,000. Although not all of them are artists, it is a fact that they are art lovers. In addition, the recent rapid development of the art world and the enthusiastic situation are unprecedented. Various art exhibitions are held continuously. If there is no systematic record, not only will they be lost without trace after a long time, but also those at home and abroad who want to understand the situation of Chinese art will not be able to obtain it. The compilation of the Art Yearbook is indeed necessary!</p>
<p>Why didn't anyone do this before? I will not elaborate on that. Under the current unstable, difficult living, and declining livelihood situation, the Art Tea Party can resolutely do this, which not only makes the art world feel great excitement, but also makes the national cultural circles cast a surprised glance. The constraints of economic and material conditions, as well as the occurrence of expected or unexpected difficulties, make people know that this is indeed a difficult job. Fortunately, on the one hand, the promotion and encouragement of Mr. Zhang Daofan, Pan Gongzhan, and Yu Wen, and on the other hand, the general director of the Art Tea Party, Wang Jingchang, can uphold his spirit of ignoring everything, working hard, and burying himself in work, day and night. From preparation to the present, in just three or four months, he has been able to get the unanimous response from more than 20 art groups across the country, and even those far away in the Philippines have come to participate. It can be seen from this whether the work is hard or not. The content of the compilation includes:</p>
<p>Precious historical materials on the rise and fall of art groups in the past fifty years.</p>
<p>Records of art movements in various places in 1947.</p>
<p>Activities of art groups in various places.</p>
<p>Art movements in art schools in various places.</p>
<p>Records of painting exhibitions in various places in 1947.</p>
<p>Activities of artists in various places. Introduction of works by artists from all over the country, divided into: epigraphy, calligraphy, Chinese painting, Western painting, sculpture, woodcut, photography, and graphic design. Among them, there are about 800 biographies of artists, 1,000 hundreds of copper plates, and more than 30 essays, with hundreds of thousands of words, which is a grand sight. I think the essence of the compilation will be commented on by experts after publication (the book will be published before about April 25, and pre-orders are now being taken). As for the quantity, it is also considerable under this environment. Because the 1947 Art Yearbook is the first Art Yearbook in our country, I am happy to introduce it. Its profound significance in helping art education and the country's literature is self-evident.</p>
<p>Today happens to be Art Festival. This journal specially selects Jiang Xiyi's article introducing the Art Yearbook recently compiled by the Shanghai Art Tea Party and Wen Zhaotong's article introducing the Compilation of Famous Paintings of Past Dynasties, to express our humble meaning of commemorating this year's Art Festival. — Editor</p>
<h3>Compilation of Famous Paintings of Past Dynasties</h3>
<p>— Wen Zhaotong</p>
<p>Compiled by Shen Zicheng, printed by World Book Company</p>
<p>Our country's painting theories are as vast as the sea. The "Art Book Series" compiled by the Shenzhou Guoguang Society has a wealth of content. Before the War of Resistance Against Japan, a friend passed on Mr. Fu Baoshi's "Chinese Painting Theory," which listed chapters such as artistic conception, charm, trees and rocks, and wrinkle methods... It was excerpted from the painting theories of various schools from Zhuang Zhou to the late Qing Dynasty, with several entries excerpted according to the chapters, annotated with sources, and occasionally added notes. It was published by the Commercial Press. However, the former is lengthy and difficult to purchase and read, while the latter, although every word is essence, readers cannot see the whole picture of famous theories.</p>
<p>The book "Compilation of Famous Paintings of Past Dynasties" has overcome this difficulty, allowing every reader to see many important painting theories since Gu Kaizhi of the Eastern Jin Dynasty. Although there are a few famous artists, such as Zhang Yanyuan of the Tang Dynasty and Yun Ge of the Qing Dynasty, whose works are only recorded as those that have a special relationship with calligraphy, such as Li Sizhen's "Supplement to the Painting Records," Monk Yanzong's "Later Painting Records," and Sheng Dashi's "Records of Lying and Traveling in Streams and Mountains" of the Qing Dynasty, have not been excerpted, but reading this book can already obtain the entire concept of Chinese painting theory.</p>
<p>This book contains famous painting theories of past dynasties, with a total of 75 famous artists and 334 volumes of painting theories, which are recorded in chronological order:</p>
<p>(1) Jin Gu Kaizhi: "Painting Criticism," "Wei and Jin Dynasties Famous Calligraphy Praise," "Records of Painting Yuntai Mountain."</p>
<p>(2) Northern and Southern Dynasties, Zong Bing: "Preface to Painting Landscapes," Wang Wei: "Introduction to Painting," Xie He: "Ancient Painting Records," Emperor Liang Yuan: "Landscape Pine and Stone Style," Yao Zui: "Continuation of Ancient Painting Records."</p>
<p>(3) Tang, Wang Wei: "Landscape Tips," "Water and Mountain Theory," Zhang Yanyuan: "On Painting."</p>
<p>(4) Five Dynasties, Jing Hao: "Book Saying," "Brushwork Records," "Landscape Tips."</p>
<p>(5) Song, Li Cheng: "Landscape Tips," Dong Yu: "Dragon Painting Compilation," Guo Xi: "Lin Quan Gao Zhi," Guo Si: "Painting Theory," Su Shi: "Dongpo Collection," Mi Fu: "Painting History," Luo Dajing: "Painting Saying," Hua Guang: "Hua Guang Plum Blossom Manual," Deng Chun: "Painting Succession," "On Boundary Calligraphy Measurement and Bending Ruler," Han Zhuo: "Complete Collection of Landscapes," Dong Zhen: "Guangchuan Painting Postscript."</p>
<p>(6) Yuan, Li Xian: "Xi Zhai Bamboo Manual," Guan Daosheng: "Ink Bamboo Manual," Huang Gongwang: "On Landscape Trees and Stones," Li Chengsou: "Painting Saying," Tao Zongyi: "Zhuo Geng Lu," etc.</p>
<p>(7) Ming, Mo Shilong: "Painting Saying," Mao Yixiang: "Painting Wonderful," Tang Zhiqie: "Zhiqie on Painting," Tang Yin: "On Painting with Brush and Ink," Tu Long: "Tu Long on Painting," etc.</p>
<p>(8) Qing, Wang Shimin: "Xilu Painting Postscript," Wang Jian: "Dyeing Fragrance Convent Painting Postscript," etc.</p>
<p>At the beginning of each era, the editor writes an overview of the painting of the era, so that readers can first understand the painting style of the era. Before each famous artist, there is also a short biography detailing their surname, narrating their titles, examining their teachers, and describing their influence. This can make readers have a clear understanding of each school. Dong Qichang said: "Reading ten thousand books and traveling ten thousand miles, the turbidity in the chest will naturally disappear, and the hill will be built in the inner camp, and Yinyue will be established immediately. Whatever you write will be a landscape that conveys the spirit." This is the golden rule followed by our country's painters. Although this book is not "ten thousand volumes," it can also be worth one in ten thousand. I hope that painters or art researchers will all read it.</p>
<h3>After Reading "The Death of a Painter"</h3>
<p>— Ji Ping</p>
<p>Truly humorous works are indeed those that make people smile through tears, a smile that is desolate and a smile that is sorrowful.</p>
<p>Mark Twain writes in "The Death of a Painter":</p>
<p>"There's a story in Hans Christian Andersen's fairy tales, which I can hardly remember. I only vaguely remember that there was a child who fed a little bird. Although the child loved this bird very much, sometimes he would forget to take care of it. The little bird did not receive his praise or his care, and sang as much as it could every day. But gradually, driven by hunger and thirst, its singing became like sobbing, and finally it stopped—it turned out that the little bird had died. This time the child ran to see and regretted it too late. So he gathered his friends, and in grief, they wholeheartedly and sincerely buried the bird. In fact, starving the poet to death and then using the money that could have made him happy for a lifetime to bury him and erect a monument is a contradiction that is not limited to children. No one has ever noticed..."</p>
<p>His novella "The Death of a Painter" vividly and profoundly reveals the situation faced by all geniuses, all genius artists in this world. It is almost their destined fate. Poverty, famine, yet still dedicated to art, continuing to create in poverty, and maintaining spiritual joy. Gradually, they feel an overwhelming sense of urgency. After all, spirit cannot fill the stomach, and their carefully crafted works of art, because they are not yet famous, are not wanted even when sold at extremely low prices. Ordinary people, those who consider themselves art connoisseurs, are often idol worshippers. They do not praise or criticize a work of art because they truly understand its true value. They often ignore, despise, and even trample on artistic talents who are not yet famous but are truly dedicated to creation. Mark Twain himself was a genius artist, and he deeply understood the sorrow of an artist. Therefore, with a humorous tone, he vividly wrote about the sorrow of thousands of art practitioners through the story of a French painter. Naturally, he further exposed the vanity and foolishness of this society. Everyone is an idol worshipper. That is truly a story that makes those who are clear-headed laugh and cry:</p>
<p>One spring, the author stayed briefly in the Mendela region and met a Mr. Smith, a "rich man" who behaved differently from others. He had been a painter engaged in artistic work. According to him, in his youth, he had two good friends, also painters, one named Fred and the other named Branjie. They painted together in the French countryside. Although they had their strengths in painting, they were both unknown and no one looked up to their works. As time went on, they could not even afford the cheapest vegetables. When they felt that they could no longer bear the hardship, a savior came, Miller. He was also a painter who had not yet enjoyed great fame, so his power was limited. After a few days, the four of them were overwhelmed by hunger.</p>
<p>Except for starving to death, they could hardly find a second way out. Even if they took a painting to exchange for a cabbage, no one would want it. Mark Twain here exhaustively writes about the tragic encounters of all the artists in the world.</p>
<p>Living is a requirement for everyone, and it is also the most basic requirement. When suffering arrives, the method of survival is forced out: that is, Branjie proposed: the four of them draw lots together, whoever is chosen dies, because the paintings after death will immediately be worth ten thousand times more. Naturally, beforehand, they must be heavily promoted, so that the friend who is chosen works hard to create, even if it is only a few strokes, the main thing is to have his signature, and the signature must be very special, so that people can know his handwriting at a glance.</p>
<p>At first, everyone was stunned, thinking he was crazy. After hearing that the chosen person would pretend to be dead, but only live in seclusion and not really die, they were overjoyed.</p>
<p>As a result, Miller was chosen. He was responsible for creating the works, and the other three went out to promote them, saying: The great painter Miller is seriously ill, and may not live long. And they tried to get newspapers to publish Miller's condition. This went on for several weeks, and it was very effective. The works of Miller they carried with them were all sold out; and the price increased each time.</p>
<p>Finally, the news of the great painter Miller's death spread, and the whole world was in mourning. The funeral was naturally grand. In order to avoid suspicion from outsiders, because the coffin contained a wax figure, it also expressed their respect. The coffin was carried by four people, naturally including Miller. In this way, a generation of great painters was mourned by millions of people in the suburbs. From then on, Miller's works became treasures, and many rich people scrambled to buy them. Therefore, the four of them, the real painters who had been forced to the brink of despair by life, not only avoided starvation, but also owned huge fortunes and became rich.</p>
<p>Yes——</p>
<p>"Are you surprised!" Mark Twain said at the end: "No wonder, only this time, the world does not starve the genius to death, but gives the rewards he deserves to others. Only this little bird does not suffer that kind of cruel treatment—singing as much as it can without any applause while alive, and receiving a grand burial after death."</p>
<p>"Because we did our 'best' to prevent him from suffering like that."</p>
<p>How much deep sadness is hidden here! The author uses a clear and humorous tone to sketch out the true state of society for us.</p>
<p>Today, in the 1950s of the 20th century, this situation still exists.</p>
<p>The living suffer hardships; the dead enjoy love and respect.</p>
<p>That day may come when artists no longer need to seek "life" through "death"; all artists who work hard in art will no longer be treated cruelly like little birds.</p>

<p>Free Talk</p>
<h3>I Also Talk About Eating</h3>
<p>— Chen Yixian</p>
<p>Recently, I saw an article about eating in "Free Talk," which was very interesting, so I came to supplement it with this one.</p>
<p>First of all, I think that paying attention to eating is not trivial; this matter is actually related to national health, and is not to be excessively criticized. Mencius said: "Food and sex are human nature." It can be seen that food is the first thing in life. Regardless of whether in China or abroad, in ancient or modern times, all revolutions and changes of dynasties have arisen because of the people's eating problems.</p>
<p>The Chinese pay attention to taste, while Westerners only talk about nutrition. In Mr. Bai Yong's article "Eating" in "Free Talk," he mentions that in the past, officials in charge of river works ate goose webs, which required the burning to death of many geese. To eat monkey brains, they would put a yoke on the neck of a live monkey, send it to the table, and break open the skull for the guests to eat with spoons. This method is too cruel and has no great nutritional value. I think what we need to study now is to combine the two issues of taste and nutrition into one, and it should not cost too much money. People who know a little about nutrition know that food contains vitamins A, B, C, etc. What they don't know is that there is also a most important element in food called Tryptophan, which is found in legumes such as cowpeas and peas, and in green leafy vegetables such as amaranth, while expensive dishes such as shark fin and abalone do not have it.</p>
<p>Every nation has its national habits, which should not and cannot be changed casually, and eating is one of them. I have a student who went to study in the United States last year, and wrote in a letter: "The food on the ship is rich and good, but after eating it for a week, I feel disgusted and very much want to eat porridge and salted vegetables." The physique of the Chinese is not as strong as that of Westerners. People often complain that eating rice is not as nourishing as bread, but Mr. Guoping's article "Rice Can Cure Disease" in "Free Talk" says: Dr. Kepner of the United States once stated in a newspaper that "rice, the food of the Chinese for thousands of years, can indeed cure high blood pressure. If you have a bowl of rice in your body, rather than a cup of milk or a steak, then you can avoid high blood pressure and increase life. Meat or fatty foods are likely to cause high blood pressure if eaten too much, while rice is a food with less protein and salt." From this, it can be seen that rice has been the food of the Chinese for thousands of years and is indeed very useful, while milk does not suit the national habits of most people. It is not necessarily a good thing for a group of people to imitate foreigners and eat Western food.</p>
<p>Western grand banquets have various kinds of wine. There is aperitif before meals, digestive wine after meals, soup wine for soup, fish wine for fish, steak wine for steak, and chicken wine for chicken, each different, it is really a grand sight. However, although foreign wines are good, the dishes are really not very good, so even with good wine, it is less appealing. Although there are not many types of wine in a Chinese meal, the best yellow wine is no less than champagne, and Moutai is as fragrant as brandy. As for the dishes, Chinese eating has dishes for drinking wine, dishes for eating rice, and dishes for eating porridge, which are really incomparable to Western food. Now I will quote two passages from "Dream of the Red Chamber" to illustrate.</p>
<p>Bao Yu and Dai Yu arrived at Aunt Xue's place. "Bao Yu praised the goose webs and duck tongues from Sister-in-law Zhen's place the other day. Aunt Xue hurriedly brought out her own pickled ones for him to enjoy. Bao Yu laughed and said, 'This is only good with wine.'" This is wine dishes. "Grandmother Jia ate wild pheasant soup and said, 'If there are any more raw ones, fry two more pieces, salty and savory, it will taste good with porridge. Although the soup is good, it is not right for porridge.'" This is the difference between porridge dishes and rice dishes.</p>
<p>Now rice is as expensive as pearls, and life is not easy. Of course, we cannot study eating to the point of eating wild pheasant soup or pickled goose webs and duck tongues. However, for those who are not in very difficult financial circumstances, it is not very expensive to pay a little attention to the taste, and it is also a kind of enjoyment in life. Apart from banquets, I think there should be five words as the standard for home-cooked meals, namely soup, braised, stir-fried, green, and pickled. Everyone knows about soup and stir-fried. Braised dishes are red-cooked dishes, such as red-cooked fish and red-braised pork. The dishes have braised sauce, which can be used to mix with rice. Green dishes refer to green vegetables, all kinds of green leafy vegetables, melons, beans, and root vegetables. Pickled dishes refer to winter pickled vegetables, fermented bean curd, and pickles. With these five or six dishes, the cost is not much, and there are dishes for wine, dishes for rice, and dishes for porridge.</p>
<p>There is a small restaurant in the old capital called Enchengju, in Shaanxi Lane. There are only two small private rooms, and not many scattered seats outside. It is full, but it can only accommodate twenty or thirty people. But there is a famous dish, which is also a very common dish—onion beef shreds. Cars often stop at the door, and many rich people come to eat it. The beef shreds are made with tenderloin, cut horizontally, fried in heavy oil over high heat, and then onion seasoning is added. There is also a shop in the old capital that sells mutton pies, in Meishi Street. Because the pies are good, the owner's surname is Zhou, and he is known as "Pie Zhou." Beef and mutton are both common foods, and a good cook can combine the two issues of taste and nutrition into one. All of this does not seem to be found in formal history, and is only used as conversation after tea and wine. At the same time, our country also shared the glory of the victorious countries, and Chinese banknotes were very popular in Germany, so it also raised our national status. Therefore, we find it particularly easy to remember those jokes built on the pain of others. The famous French journalist Cao Luo seems to have said in his book "The Fall of Paris" that after 1917, the morality of the German people deteriorated. For a small account of one US dollar, they could lose the face of the "German nation." It can be seen that the so-called integrity and shame are based on banknotes and food. Although Germany is a defeated country this time, the mark has not collapsed as it did last time. Our eastern neighbor is laughing at this victor with the arrogance of the defeated. We are reviewing "The Fate of Germany" and we really can't bear to say it!</p>
<h3>Idioms Have Origins</h3>
<p>— Jin Yuan</p>
<p>The idioms popular in today's society seem very common, but a closer examination reveals that they all have classical origins. For example, "keqi" (polite) comes from Zuo Zhuan, Duke Ding, year eight; "huangtang" (absurd) comes from Zhuangzi; "duoxie" (many thanks) comes from Biography of Li Guang in Han Shu; "dasuan" (plan) comes from Biography of Liu Bingzhong in Yuan Shi; "buzhongyong" (useless) comes from Shi Ji; "zhuoli" (exert effort) comes from Nan Qi Shu; "wurenzhen" (don't take it seriously) comes from Biography of Wang Kejing in Yuan Shi; "qiyoucili" (unreasonable) is a saying of Sima Guang; "chazui" (interrupt) comes from Wu Deng Hui Yuan; "hehe daxiao" (laughing loudly) and "yaotoubǎiwěi" (wagging head and tail) are both found in Chuan Deng Lu; "caoza" (noisy) comes from Bao Puzi; "tanherongyi" (how easy is it) comes from Biography of Dongfang Shuo in Han Shu; "benqian" (capital) comes from Food and Goods Records in Han Shu; "bunainaifan" (impatient) comes from Biography of Yu Dengzhi in Zhu Shu; "qidianbadao" (stumbling) comes from Zhu Zi Yu Lei; "sanfansifu" (repeatedly) is a saying of an old monk in Song Zhen Kong Temple; "yidaban" (dressed up) comes from Huang Gongshao's poem; "baxiu" (give up) comes from Shi Ji; "cuoda" (ignorant scholar) comes from "Quan Tang Shi Hua"; "jiaose" (role) comes from Chao Ye Lei Yao; "maobing" (problem) comes from Shan Gu Ji; "liushen" (be careful) comes from Biography of Dongfang Shuo; "zhuangju" (blindly recommend) comes from Bai Xiangshan's poem; "pianyi" (advantage) comes from Gu Xianzhi's memorial in Nan Qi Shu; "duishou" (opponent) comes from Jiu Tang Shu; "chaoliwurenmozubing" (don't be a guest if you have no one in court) is seen in Yuan people's reclusive words. Although they are words from the streets and alleys, it can also be known that no word is without an origin.</p>
<h3>A Small Record of Measuring Pearls</h3>
<p>— Ji Yong</p>
<p>First, I will copy a passage from the book: Ming Dynasty, Yu, "Record of Wet Clothes Around the City of Bian" in the third siege, below the item "A Horse Worth a Thousand Gold," it says: "Grain and grass had been cut off for a long time, and war horses were useless. The armies were short of food, and the military commissioner ordered the officers to slaughter horses to fill the coffers. Soldiers slaughtered a horse and mixed it with human flesh, selling each catty for several taels of silver. A horse could be worth a thousand gold. The ancient saying goes, 'Selling dog meat while hanging up a sheep's head,' and now we see selling human flesh while hanging up a horse's head! The people had only a grain of rice like a pearl, while the officers and soldiers still had surplus grain, which they collected from large households. Country squires and wealthy families sought to buy it, only caring about getting grain and not caring about the price, selling a liter of grain for ten thousand coins. There were pearl merchants who carried pearls to exchange for rice, but the small pearls were thrown away on the ground without being looked at, and if a grain of rice fell, they carefully picked it up. Rice was more valuable than pearls, which was indeed seen. On the day the grain ran out, every household closed its doors, resigned to waiting for death. There were no pedestrians on the streets, and if there were any lone travelers in secluded alleys, they were often dragged in and killed by the strong men at home, and the meat was divided and eaten, and no one would investigate. If anyone reported it to the officials, they would not have time to deal with it. Although proclamations were issued to prohibit and arrest, they could not stop it. There were even cases of people breaking into houses at night, secretly killing the people, and stealing the meat to take home. Residents, fearing for their own safety, first killed and ate their maids and servants. What was even more unbearable to hear was that fathers ate their children, a tragic injustice to heaven and earth, and the sun and moon were dark! When the grain ran out, the strong soldiers only ate by killing people, and the people in the secluded streets and alleys all gathered in the large markets to live together, protecting each other. They not only carved out corpses to cook, but also broke down houses to burn, and painted beams and carved rafters were turned into broken walls. The families were without smoke and cold stoves, and the birds flew far away and disappeared. In the past, Suiyang still had sparrows to catch and rats to dig up, but now there were no sparrows or rats, which had never been seen in past history. Because the officers and soldiers ran out of grain, they pretended to run the camp and defected to the rebels; there were also those who killed the refugees who were picking vegetables because it was difficult, and cut off their heads to report the merit and reward. Fearing that their families would recognize their faces, they cut several knives on their faces to change their shape. They carried the heads into the city in the morning to present the merit, and there were often hundreds of people rushing to buy them, with the price reaching several taels. Soldiers tolerated the injustice of the people, which was rarely seen in ancient and modern times!..."</p>
<p>This is a page of blood and tears in the history of the people of the Central Plains in the late Ming Dynasty, which is no less than the "Shu Bi" recording Zhang Xianzhong. I often wonder how much rationality humans actually have, and to what extent it goes. Now it is very simply proven, that is, until they have nothing to eat and their stomachs are hungry. We see in the city of Kaifeng three hundred years ago, wealthy people measuring pearls to buy rice. At that time, there was not necessarily inflation as there is today, and the people did not trust money. If money loses its value as a means of exchange, it has no use value at all! I don't know if this can move the gentlemen who are now speculating in gold and stocks. The Chinese people seem to have always only had the qualification to be eaten by others, from paying taxes to being beheaded by soldiers and selling the meat for silver, it is all the same. Zhao Ou Bei's "Notes on the Twenty-Two Histories" also says: "During the Zhenguan era, a dou of rice was three coins. In the year when Emperor Xuanzong sacrificed to Mount Tai, a dou of rice in Dongjun was ten coins, and a dou of rice in Qingqi was five coins. Since the An-Shi Rebellion, there has been no end to military service, the fields have been barren, and there has also been the abuse of spreading households... Within ten households, five have fled, and even the five who have not fled are equally burdened with taxes. It is like throwing a stone into a well, and it will not stop until it reaches the bottom. Therefore, the more people who flee, the less land is cultivated. In the first year of Yongtai during the reign of Emperor Daizong, a dou of rice in the capital was 1,400 coins, and the suburbs supplied the imperial kitchen with rice based on the ears. When the wheat ripened, there were drunkards in the market, already praising it as an auspicious sign. Compared with the Zhenguan and Kaiyuan eras, it was almost tens or hundreds of times more. Readers of history can see the changes in the world from this. As for places of attack and war, when the city is besieged and the grain is cut off, there are even more things that cannot be explained by common sense. When Lu Ling defended Nanyang, the rebel generals Wu Lingxun and Tian Chengsi attacked it for months, and a dou of rice cost forty or fifty thousand, with a price but no rice, and a rat was worth four hundred coins. When An Qingxu was besieged in Xiangzhou, a dou of rice cost seventy thousand coins. When Huang Chao occupied Chang'an, the people fled into the mountain fortresses, and for years they abandoned farming. The rebels sat and guarded the empty city, and the price of grain soared, with a dou of rice costing thirty thousand coins. The government soldiers all arrested the mountain fortress people and sold them to the rebels for food, and one person was worth hundreds of thousands. When Yang Xingmi besieged Yangzhou, the grass roots, tree fruits, leather bags, and leather belts in the city were all gone. The foreign troops plundered people to sell, and a person cost fifty thousand coins. Zhang Xiong had military rations and agreed to trade, one catty of gold and one belt could get five sheng of rice."</p>
<p>The people's bad luck, isn't it exactly the same as in the Ming Dynasty? Both the officers and soldiers and the rebels wanted to eat the people, and they cooperated very well. I don't know what the meaning of this war is! In the past, when I read Du Fu's poem "Qiang Village," which said, "Don't refuse the wine's thin taste, the millet land has no one to cultivate, the war is not yet over, and the children have all gone to the east," I already felt it was full of sadness, but compared to this, it is still heaven. When I was young, I read Zuo Zhuan, the story of Hua Yuan and Zi Fan, and I still didn't believe it. What about exchanging children for food and breaking bones to cook? Although the state of Zheng was a small country, how could it be so bad! How would I know that there is a limit to exaggeration in writing, but this kind of talk is not nonsense. For example, at this moment, the price of rice is so outrageous that even people living here and now find it hard to believe. How can historians write in such a way that people in the future will not think it is nonsense? I really can't think of it. After the First European War, we laughed at the old story of the German mark, and a friend of mine who was traveling in Europe at that time said that when eating in restaurants, it was usually calculated in eggs, because calculating in marks was really too troublesome. For example, the price of the second cup of beer may be different from the first. An old lady sold her house and got tens of billions of marks, and was quite happy, but unexpectedly, a week later, her money could only buy one egg.</p>
<h3>Owl</h3>
<p>— He Dao</p>
<p>There is a saying in our country that Gongye Chang understood the language of birds, but I did not expect that in ancient Western times, there were also people who specialized in predicting good and bad luck from the actions and calls of birds. Westerners call this "knowledge" "Ornithomancy," which is exactly opposite to "alchemy," and it can be said that there is no coincidence. But we have always considered hearing the owl's cry as ominous, while in the West it is not always the case.</p>
<p>For example, the ancient Greeks showed great respect for owls. In the Battle of Salamis, an owl suddenly came to the mast of the flagship of the Greek naval commander, and the morale of the army was greatly boosted, thinking that victory was within reach. As a result, they won a great victory. Modern ornithologists believe that owls are actually very clumsy birds, but the Greek philosophers of two thousand years ago regarded owls as symbols of wisdom.</p>
<p>The Romans, however, thought differently. They said that owls were specialized in sucking the blood of children. As long as an owl came to the roof, someone in this family was bound to die. One day, an owl was found on the roof of the Temple of Jupiter, which the Romans most believed in, and all the priests, diviners, etc. in the city were shocked. They quickly caught the owl, burned it alive, and scattered the ashes in the Tiber River. The priests chanted scriptures while quickly perfuming the entire city, considering it a way to resolve the disaster.</p>
<p>Of course, from the perspective of modern people, this kind of behavior is simply ignorant and ridiculous. Ornithologists regard owls as ordinary birds, and in various European and American countries, there are already many people who specifically raise many owls as a pastime, just as many people like to raise dogs and cats. According to scientists, there are more than 300 species of owls, and there are traces of owls in the icy and snowy Arctic and in the dense forests of the tropics. Why do scientists think owls are clumsy? It is because their eyes can only look straight ahead and cannot move freely. If they want to see things on the left and right, they must twist their heads as much as possible to the left and right. However, they also have a unique skill, which is that when they are clearly standing forward, if someone sneaks up from behind, they will suddenly twist their two toes without moving their body, and aim their sharp claws at the person or other animal behind them and stab them in.</p>
<p>Owls are quite amazing at eating. Their food includes rabbits, turtles, mice, small birds, frogs, fish, crabs, clams, various insects, and sometimes they also eat lizards and snakes. They sometimes peck off some feathers that are not easy to swallow, and then tear the food into large pieces and swallow it. Things that are easy to digest go to the stomach and intestines, while things that are not easy to eat, such as scales, fur, and feathers, they will keep in their mouths, roll them together, and spit them out in one gulp, like a round ball.</p>
<p>However, in the eyes of many people who love owls, owls are not annoying at all. After being raised for a long time, they will also fly around when their owners tell them to. People have gradually stopped regarding them as unlucky birds, because the "knowledge" of "Ornithomancy" has long become a historical term along with the Roman Empire.</p>
<h3>The Story of Michelangelo</h3>
<p>— Leng Leng</p>
<p>One day, the famous Italian art sculptor Michelangelo was sculpting a marble statue, and a relative and friend visited him. Seeing Michelangelo concentrating on his work without leaving the statue, he expected that it would be completed in a few days. To avoid disturbing his work, he hurriedly said goodbye.</p>
<p>Several months later, he visited Michelangelo again. Seeing the same statue as before, he ridiculed Michelangelo in surprise:</p>
<p>"Brother, I visited you several months ago, and you were working hard. I guessed that it would be completed in a few days, but isn't the statue that I see now standing there unchanged as before?"</p>
<p>Michelangelo replied:</p>
<p>"Not at all, I haven't been lazy. In the past few months, I have been modifying this place and polishing that place, making the face here softer and the muscles there stronger. Look, the lips here now have a slight expression, and strength has been added to the feet." He explained in such detail.</p>
<p>After hearing this, he couldn't help laughing coldly:</p>
<p>"Indeed, those are good, but brother, isn't that too subtle? It takes so much effort for such a small thing, how can a great work be produced?"</p>
<p>So Michelangelo replied with an extremely solemn attitude:</p>
<p>"Perhaps a great work cannot be produced as you said, but you must know that all perfect works are made up of many small attentions and small works. Therefore, those who accomplish great things are careful in their attention and effort."</p>
<p>Michelangelo's success in art was really due to this.</p>
<h3>Good Name</h3>
<p>— Donghua</p>
<p>Most celebrities in the world love fame and self-respect, even Washington could not avoid this. He once hoped that people would unanimously praise his great name and compliment him as the most powerful great man in the world.</p>
<p>After Columbus discovered the New World, he was already widely praised, but he still asked the Spanish government to grant him the titles of "Grand Admiral of the Sea" and "Prime Minister of India."</p>
<p>Empress Catherine of Russia would discard any letter that did not address her as "Your Majesty" without reading it.</p>
<p>Mrs. Lincoln, Mary Todd, sat proudly in the White House, looking around with self-importance. Once, Mrs. General Grant came to visit, and she sat down without being offered a seat. Mrs. Lincoln became furious and reprimanded her in person.</p>
<p>The American explorer Peary, who had explored the South Pole and other places, was sponsored by many wealthy people. The wealthy people wanted to use their own names as place names for all the places he explored.</p>
<p>The French [author] relied on Russian literature for his fame and reputation in the art world. He even hoped to change the French capital "Paris" to "嚣俄."</p>
<p>Shakespeare also hoped that the British government would grant him special titles that would be passed down through the ages.</p>
<h3>Idle Talk About Names</h3>
<p>— Chen Zuogao</p>
<p>The distinction of names was already discussed as far back as the Spring and Autumn period. The Tan Gong chapter of the Book of Rites says, "Infant name, adulthood title." The commentary further explains its meaning, saying: "A name is given three months after birth, hence it is called the infant name. At the age of twenty, one has the way of being a father; friends and the like cannot call one by their name again, so one is capped and given a title." It can be seen that a person's name has always preceded the title since ancient times. The time difference is also more than ten years. As for the relationship between the name and the title, only Feng Junmu (and) his father-in-law mentioned it. Even someone as erudite as Zhang Taiyan did not add a definitive conclusion to this, only saying, "The name and the title are different designations; one cannot have two names, and the most numerous offspring are called titles." (See Guogu Lunheng)</p>
<p>According to Father-in-law, [He] was a famous Confucian scholar of the late Qing Dynasty, with unrestrained talent. [He] wrote "Wen of Huifeng Hall," meticulously crafting sentences and writing like the Wei and Jin dynasties. What he said about the difference between names and titles is even more insightful. According to him, "A person's title is always closely related to his name; the pseudonym can be used as one pleases and can be increased to an endless number." This is indeed true when examining examples. For example, Tao Zongyi of the Yuan Dynasty, who wrote "Zhuo Geng Lu," had the title "Jiucheng"; this was based on the sentence "Xiao Shao nine-ch'eng, phoenixes come to dance" in the Book of Yu. Also, Wang Mingsheng, who wrote "Seventeen Histories Shangque," had the title "Fenghua," which is also related to his name and has a clear meaning. The pseudonym is different. For example, Shi Daoji had more than twenty pseudonyms; the most famous ones are Xia Zunzhe, Kugua Heshang, and Shishou. Also, Shen Zipei, in addition to the commonly used pseudonym Yi'an Meisou, also had dozens of pseudonyms, scattered in various ink works. Even his son, Mr. Ci Hu, could not examine them in detail.</p>
<p>Ancient Confucians often liked to pick and use the characters "Bo," "Zhong," "Shu," "Ji," "Kong," "Meng," "Gong," and "Zi" when naming. Looking at historical figures, such as Long Bogao, Kong Zhongni, Yang Shuzi, Wu Jizha, Zhuge Kongming, Chen Menggong, and Shen Mengyuan (named Yuan, a poet of the Ming Dynasty), all have these characters embedded in their names. Secondly, those whose names after the surname resemble An (Chen Kuilong, pseudonym Yong'an) or Qi (Duanfang, pseudonym Taoqi) are generally pseudonyms rather than titles.</p>
<p>Chinese literati often like to change their names in middle age. This is also true in recent times. Among the advanced members of the Party-State, such as Hu Hanmin's name being Fabian, Yu Youren's name being Boxun, Shao Lizi's name being Wentai, Wu Zhihui's name being Tiao, Zhang Taiyan's name being Jiang, Pan Gongzhan's name being Youyou, Chen Bulei's name being Xun'en, Shao Yuanchong's name being Jiru, Zeng Yangfu's name being Xianhao, Yu Jingtang's name being Yu, Cheng Tianfang's name being Xueyu, and Liu Luyin's name being Shende, all were used in their early years and are now abandoned. In addition, there are many similar cases among calligraphers and painters, as far as I know, such as Zhang Daqian's name being Zhengquan, Feng Chaoran's name being Jiong, Wu Hufan's name being Yanyi, Chen Julai's name being Tui, Zhao Shuru's name being Shigang, and Wang Fuchang's name being Shouqi.</p>
<h3>Before Success</h3>
<p>— Mao Yi</p>
<p>If you have confidence in yourself and your potential abilities, then you should exercise yourself and cultivate your potential, and you must not abandon yourself because of failure, nor be discouraged by the cold ridicule of others. Many successful people are ridiculed or despised before they become prominent, but because they have confidence, they finally answered the ridicule and contempt with success. Please look at the following examples:</p>
<p>Louisa May Alcott, the author of "Little Women," was a mischievous girl who could not tell beans from wheat and was ignorant in the eyes of her fellow villagers. Once, a publisher even "advised" her to give up writing.</p>
<p>Before she became famous, the American short story writer Jenny Gray wanted to sell one of his manuscripts to a publisher, who said that he had no ability to write novels, which made Gray very embarrassed.</p>
<p>When George Gershwin, the author of "Rhapsody in Blue," first appeared on stage to play the piano, he was laughed off the stage. Those who laughed at him were not only the actors on the same stage, but also the audience off stage.</p>
<p>The American "Five and Ten Cent Store" is now thriving and has many branches. Its founder, Woolworth, was once employed by a retail store. The boss of the store believed that Woolworth did not even have the business sense to greet customers, so he assigned him the humble position of guarding the door, with a salary of fifty cents a day.</p>
<p>Let's take a look at those great scientists before they succeeded:</p>
<p>When Marconi, the "father of wireless radio," first started researching wireless radio, he was first ridiculed by his father, who said that Marconi was wasting his time.</p>
<p>Einstein was regarded as a fool by his teachers during his school days, and even his parents believed that their child was not promising.</p>
<p>And Edison, he always ranked at the bottom in school exams. Teachers called him a "stupid fellow," and doctors said there was something wrong with his brain!</p>
<h3>Random Thoughts</h3>
<p>— Gong Hua</p>
<p>God does not easily judge people's good and evil, and must wait until the Last Judgment to make a judgment; why should we humans judge people's right and wrong based on temporary impatience? (Johnson)</p>
<p>What distinguishes man from beasts is that he has the ability to initiate self-reflection as an important human artifice. (Dewey)</p>
<p>Only a contemptible man who is conceited makes the gods weep and sigh. (Shakespeare)</p>
<p>Many people cannot become thinkers because their memory is too good. (Natchiga)</p>
<h3>Between Good and Evil</h3>
<p>— Zhongming</p>
<p>Sometimes we simply cannot distinguish between a person's good and evil and the good and bad of a thing. We often hear disputes where A thinks that person C is very good, while B thinks that A's view is completely wrong, and debates between A and B about the "right" and "wrong," "good" and "evil" caused by the same event. The reason for such disputes and debates is nothing more than the fact that the boundaries between "good" and "evil" have not been clearly defined, and when the problem of survival has become a universal threat today, everyone is pursuing "profit" under the sole condition of survival in order to sustain life. The "good" and "evil" problems that arise in this are often even more confusing.</p>
<p>However, if we think about it carefully, the good and bad of a thing can certainly be judged, and a good person and a bad person can still be distinguished after all. For example, if a poor person commits a theft because his life is on the verge of desperation, in principle, the sympathy we feel should be greater than the blame; conversely, if a rich person earns profits with his own capital, but if the means he uses are harmful to the public, then we still dislike him. Furthermore, the ordinary people who are determined to maintain the value of money and have to buy some daily necessities in the face of a straight-line rise in prices should certainly not be labeled with the many bad words "hoarding" and "exploitation." We praise a farmer or worker who exchanges labor for food, and we should at least not praise a tenant farmer who idles around and makes the fields barren or a landlord who only maintains a false life of enjoyment with the labor of others. As for those who have already eaten their fill and are instigating strikes for no reason, they should naturally be spurned by us. Speaking of students, a patriotic student is lovable, but those who only shout patriotic slogans, are unwilling to study hard, and some who are just living in a muddle-headed way, only hoping to get a diploma, should not be praised by us. Speaking of war, then the "good" and "evil" distinction between the resistance generated for the sake of righteous defense and the other side's deliberate ambition to invade is even more obvious.</p>
<p>People tend towards the "good" side. Generally speaking, people will only choose the evil side unless they have to. However, judging from the current situation, there are many who are not out of "necessity" but often go down the path of evil; and there are many who are facing "necessity" but are not willing to fall into the abyss of evil and darkness and are still struggling desperately; from this point of view, we cannot help but particularly regret the former's fall into evil and praise the latter's approach to the light.</p>
<h3>Pre-congratulatory Opening of the National Assembly</h3>
<p>— Zhang Yiqu</p>
<p>The National Assembly is scheduled to open on Youth Day this year, and the closing date is expected to be after Children's Day. Spring returns to the earth, coinciding with a glimmer of life. Human determination will conquer nature, do not say that there are many difficulties in all directions. What is hoped for is that all reforms will start anew with the people. Therefore, I have composed a poem to announce to the people of the country.</p>
<p>I worry day and night about the white grass and yellow clouds,</p>
<p>I make plans according to the Three Laws.</p>
<p>I still hope that Liao Yang will send a campaign uniform,</p>
<p>And that Northern Jiangsu will fully change flags.</p>
<p>Settling the country and settling the border is not a bad plan,</p>
<p>Unifying the people and unifying things is a new path.</p>
<p>After Youth Day is Children's Day,</p>
<p>And life will remain in the mountains and rivers.</p>
<h3>Wandering Flower</h3>
<p>— Chen Shenyan</p>
<p>Chapter 13: Attempting to Remedy (108)</p>
<p>Zhu Qi was stunned when he heard her words, knowing that there must be something behind them, and he did not want to pursue the matter further. He said dejectedly, "Will you allow me to come again in the future?" Yun Qing shook her head and said, "It's best not to meet." Zhu Qi stretched out his hand and said, "Will you allow me to shake your hand?" Yun Qing stretched out her hand and grasped Zhu Qi's hand. Zhu Qi felt that her hand was cold and trembling. He knew that she was greatly stimulated in her heart. Saying goodbye, he turned and went downstairs. Walking on the street, he felt extremely sad. He felt that if he broke off relations with a close friend of more than twenty years, would he be sorry to her or would she be sorry to him? This mystery must be broken so that he could feel relieved. She has already gone to ask Uncle Xiao Bai, so now he can only go to his house to ask so that he knows. However, Uncle Xiao Bai has a very bad temper. How can he ask him? Does he already know about himself and Qi Wan? He never meddles in other people's affairs. Even if he knows, I don't think he would stir up trouble. While thinking, he walked until he reached Dong Dan Pailou, and then he remembered to hire a car and came to the Fei residence. Uncle Xiao Bai was at home, lying in bed resting. When he saw Zhu Qi come in, he nodded, greeted him to sit on the couch, and asked, "You haven't been here for a long time. I heard that Qi Wan left?" Zhu Qi's face turned red when he saw that he asked about Qi Wan as soon as he met him. Before he could answer, he heard Uncle Xiao Bai continue, "I have been very worried since she left. I recently received good news, and I feel relieved. I heard that Xiao He recently received a telegram from her mother, Liu Ru, telling him to send Qi Wan's luggage to Shanghai. From this, it seems that Qi Wan has the ambition to revive her career in the pear garden. Mr. Mei is still in Shanghai now. Qi Wan has always been known for those few Mei-style operas. Now that Mr. Mei is in Shanghai to guide her in person, I think she will be very successful on stage. She is very smart and willing to work hard, so she will definitely be very successful. It can be said that I initiated her departure this time. I don't need to say the reason. Maybe you will understand in your heart. I was afraid that she would be stimulated and go astray. Now that she has returned to the pear garden world, I can rest assured. As for you, you almost went astray too. I didn't point it out to you in person at the time. I secretly separated the two of you. If I had told you at the time, you would have hated me to death—but today, your parents and couples are still without any complaints, and the family is very happy, which cannot but be said to be my credit. You should work hard in the future!"</p>

<p>Reader Consultation Legal Interpretation</p>
<h3>Living Together for Fourteen Years Without Knowing Her Lover Was a Thief Woman Fears Being Implicated and Appeals for Relief</h3>
<p>Zhang Zhen asks: My girlfriend, Miss So-and-so, lived with a man named A for fourteen years and had a son and a daughter. At that time, she only knew that he was doing business outside. It was not until last year that she learned that A had committed theft outside and had been in prison once. Recently, he has committed many crimes, and the woman fears being implicated and intends to break away from him. There are the following questions, and I would like to ask your column to answer: (1) Miss So-and-so now wants to break away from the cohabitation relationship with A. I don't know what legal problems there are and what procedures are required? (2) Can Miss So-and-so take away the children she gave birth to? (3) Miss So-and-so is going to the police station to report him, but she is afraid that he will harm her in the future. If she does not report him, will Miss So-and-so be considered to have committed a crime? (4) If the woman leaves in private, can A interfere with her actions?</p>
<p>[Legal Advisor Mr. Tang Mingshi Answers] (1) Cohabitation, even if it lasts for a long time, such as the fourteen years mentioned in the question, cannot obtain the status of husband and wife due to the length of time. In other words, cohabitation is still cohabitation, and its relationship does not differ depending on the length of time. If you ask about the legal relationship of cohabitation, it means that if you are compatible, you stay, and if you are not compatible, you leave. As for the separation procedures, Shanghai often publishes announcements in the newspaper. In fact, publishing in the newspaper is just a form of expression. As for the battle for custody of children, unless there is another agreement, it should originally be the responsibility of the man. The legislation protects children because modern male society has more abundant abilities (see the Divorce Example of the Civil Code). However, the court may determine the guardian for the benefit of the children. For example, if the man is a thief, for the sake of the children and for the sake of society, the official will give the woman custody. (3) Husband and wife may protect each other from committing crimes, which is human nature. However, cohabitation has the suspicion of partnership, and reporting is not abnormal. Breaking away from cohabitation can avoid being implicated, but you must not take away the stolen goods. (4) Breaking away from cohabitation can also be done unilaterally; in legal theory, cohabitation cannot be forced.</p>
