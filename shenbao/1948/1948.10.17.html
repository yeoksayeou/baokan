<p>星期論壇中國之反共戰  賴璉　　今日鐵幕後之東歐，巳爲莫斯科所控制，世界其他各國，亦無不受共產主義之威脅。中國則與共產主義作殊死之鬥爭，已逾二十五年。吾人雖歷遭共黨之破壞與災害，但自信在此二十餘年之鬥爭中，巳使中國成爲反共之先鋒，巳使蘇聯赤化亞洲之陰謀，至今未能得逞其十一。　　余今日以國民黨常委資格及代表中國人民之立塲，爲我中國及國民黨辯護，並非文過飾非，欺臨友邦。中國受帝國主義侵略，歷經變亂，已逾百年，八年抗戰之後，元氣大傷，共匪乃於此時發動大規模之軍事叛變，交通被其破壞，工礦被其毀滅，城市被其洗刦，人民被其屠殺，造成歷史上空前之悲慘與恐怖。中國政府所負荷之責任，及所遭遇之困難，（諸君指美國人，下仿此）設身處地，當可想見。　　吾人並不否認行政效能未能達到理想之期望，更不能否認生產之降落，民生之凋敝，一般經濟狀况之惡劣，但此種現象，大部份爲共匪所釀成，亦爲共產國際普遍製造貧窮，飢餓，戰爭，災害，全盤計劃之一部。此爲鐵的事實，無論共匪及其外國，如何善於宣傳，亦無法加以否定。　　一般人受共匪宣傳影響，以爲中國不應再有「內戰」。實則中國正如美國，爲一酷愛和平之民族，苟非共匪爲虎作倀，挑動戰爭，決不至同室操戈，自相殘殺。今日中國抵抗赤色帝國主義，決不能稱爲內戰。中國之奮鬥，一方面固係爲民族求生存，爲國家求獨立，同時亦卽世界反赤陣綫最重要之一環。中國若向赤色帝國主義屈服，遠東安定力量，立卽動搖，三次大戰，隨時可以爆發。諸君若明此理，卽不至再言中國之反共戰爲內載矣。　　吾人對於馬歇爾使命之失敗，固當引爲遺憾。但如當時接受共匪條件，成立聯合政府，則中國早已成爲第二波蘭或捷克。美國今日始知共黨之不可信賴，吾人則巳有二十五年之痛苦經驗矣。國民黨二十年前卽知共黨問題之嚴重性，故曾一度吸引彼等加入國民黨，以期消弭禍害於無形。不意彼等加入以後，包藏禍心，陰謀侵佔，卽以今日美國共黨所施行之滲透政策，週密計劃，按步實施。余於一九二六年自美歸國；親覩共匪先則以各種動跑之霄胞　號，表示合作，甚至公開宣餐效忠國民黨，繼則一面以其重要份子，侵入黨政機關，把握關健位濺，一面派其黨羽，普遍滲透社會各階曆，農工團體，呌囂威骨，製造恐怖，破壞秩序，以求達到奪取政權之目的。有非蔣總統具有遠見，斷然淸除共匪，則國民黨二十年前卽巳被其消滅矣！　　抗日勝利以後，美國誤以爲共匪可與妥協，故有所謂政治協商，軍事調處，甚至有聯合政府之建議。馬歇爾將軍之赴華，卽係負有此種使命者。馬氏功高望重，世人景仰，中國復正需要和平建設，故對馬氏赴華，無不熱烈歡迎，政府尤願竭誠合作，採納各種建議。　　共匪堅持世界革命之成見，永遠不與任何人眞誠妥協，當其力量微弱之時，卽以甜言蜜語，欺騙世人，一旦羽毛聯滿，卽可背秦一切信約，賣友賣國，均所不惜。蓋彼輩心目中，旣無法律觀念，更無道德標凖。是以馬氏使命之失敗，共匪應負完全實任。實則共匪亳無誠意可言，馬氏工作開始之時，莫斯科卽已決定加以破壤。彼輩之策略：（一）拖延時間，以便擴充及增强共匪之軍事地位。（二）挑撥中美情感。（三）將談判失敗之責任置諸政府。　　吾人素認羅斯福總統爲中國之友人，但渠於德國投降以後，對日估計錯誤，竟以關係中國生存之東北基本權利，作爲蘇聯出兵攻日之交換條件，並以滿足史達林帝國主義之野心。於是鐵路權利完全斷送，旅順大連名存實亡，外蒙復經正式承認獨立。蘇聯一面遷延撤兵日期，一面拆遷價值達廿億美金之工礦設備，同時武裝共匪造成無窮紛亂，不但危害中國生存，實亦威脅美國安全，破壤遠東和平，中美與全世界同受其害。余不憚煩瑣，敍述此歷史之錯誤，正欲美國知所警惕。蓋今日此項禍害，尙在日漸擴大，而美國外交政策，及其對華對蘇方針，猶在徘徊歧路，舉棋不定，余實不能不爲世界前途憂慮也。　　共匪自言與蘇聯無直接關係，又自稱爲從事土地改革之政黨，實則共匪禍國殃民，只可稱爲漢奸，叛軍，或第五縱隊，所謂土地改革云云，不過將其佔領區全部土地充公，並將不能聽命之農民加以屠殺細逐而已。　　有人以爲共匪發展迅速，似得人民贊助，實則人民在其佔領區城，全爲毫無自由，亳無保障之俘虜。彼輩隨時驅之作戰，或則加以奴役，或則藉口殺戳。彼輩旣以裹脅方法，强迫人民當兵，故可不愁兵員之缺少。彼輩復以刧掠方式，沒收人民財產，故可不愁財源之匱乏。然而人民在其鐵蹄統制之下，誠牛馬奴款之不右矣！　　余曾與共匪周旋二十餘年，其野心，其策略，其組織能力，其宣傳技術，余知之甚悉。余因多年從事敎育，又深知共匪如何麻醉青年，如何誘惑青年作奸犯土，背叛祖國。余前為國立西北大學校長，適與毛澤東之延安政府同在陜西。彼輩常派鐵羽潛入大學，挑撥情感，煽動學潮，造成學校恐怖與社會不安狀况。幸余防患未然，常於事前遏止變亂，乃得保障學生安全及學術自由。　　中國反抗極權思想之共產主義，固望友邦積極援助，但自身努力，從不懈怠。無論所遭遇之困難，如何嚴重，仍向民主憲政大道邁進。前年公佈憲章，本年成立民選政府，余卽爲此民選立法院之一員。吾人明知當前敵人實較日本尤爲凶橫，但吾人決不氣餒，且堅信共匪必歸失敗，中國前途充滿光明與希　　再就經濟方面言之。中國竟敢於此困難重重之今日，革新幣制，平抑物價，爲時不及一月，卽已顯著成效，此卽表示中國具有自力更生之決心。吾人相信從此金融可以穩定，人民生　　吾人建國計劃，均照三民主義逐步實行，尤其民生主義部份，可稱爲和平而進步之社會主義。吾人主張節制資本，同時保護私人企業。主張平均地權，同時允計私人保持地產。英國工黨之設施，正與國民黨所主張者相符。諸君固知英國工黨為歐洲抵抗共黨之强有力者，故知中國亦惟國民黨之社會主義經濟政策，可以消除共匪災害，抵抗蘇聯侵略。　　美國巳知在共產主義繼續進攻之下，不但柏林局勢，日趨緊張，且其黨徒之地下工作及滲透政策，尤使人人感覺安全與生存，均受莫大威脅，任何國不能例外。然而一般人之觀感，仍然漢視亞洲赤化之危機，甚至共黨外圍公然宣稱，縱令共黨獲得中國政權，亦對美國無影響。此實蘇聯授意之毒辣宣傳，吾人必須揭破其陰謀，以免美國再受朦蔽。　　二十餘年來，共產國際從未忽視亞洲，尤其對於多災多難之中國，處心積慮，無所不用其極。蓋亞洲久受西方帝國主義之侵略，人民生活水準，旣不甚高，而民族主喂之思想，復正蔓延各地，在朝鮮·在安南·在緬匈·在這　·在馬來亞·在印波尼西亞·甚至在印度·日本·與菲律濱，共鐵宣傳均有長足之進展。正因中國尙能剿滅共匪，抵抗蘇聯，故東南亞各國之安全，尙能賴以保持。若中國爲莫斯科所征服，則整個亞洲立卽隨之赤化，而此十萬萬以上之人口，俱可爲蘇聯所利用，一切蘇聯方式之恫嚇·欺詐·恐怖·殺戳卽將遍及全球，民主政治與現代文明，隨時可遭毀滅。不知美國又將何以自處也！　　美國不願再有戰爭，一如中國。但共產國際必欲以其極權主義之思想，奴役全世界之人民，凡不俯首聽命者，均被目爲反動，頑固，或戰爭販子。一切綏靖政策，絕對不能自共黨手中爭取和平，至多不過換得如捷克之員奈斯或馬薩克之命運而已。　　今日全世界眞有實力，能在政洽經濟軍事各方面，與蘇聯相抗衡者，惟此富强康樂之美國。但美國人民講公道，重法律，而復不願有戰爭。蘇聯利用美國此弱點，一再向歐亞各國進行突擊，或藉軍事，或用宣傳，或在聯合國遲用否決權，或指使各國共黨背叛祖國，製造紛亂；所用方式，因時因地各有不同，然最終目的乃在以蘇聨政治思想及作風，強迫其他各國接受，換言之，卽欲以以其共產主議征服世界奴役人類。迨至歐洲全部解除武裝，中國喪失抵抗能力，美國勢成孤立，蹤有豐富資源及原子武器，恐亦無能爲力。美國雖不願有職爭，而戰爭勢必逼至國門。兩次大戰之敎訓，美國豈均不記憶乎？　　蘇聯具有世界革命之野心，無論對歐·對亞·對美，均有互相聯繫之整套陰謀。美國若無一種有遠見而復堅定之世界政策，以資對抗，則一切民主自由國家，均將被其鯨吞蠶食，各個擊破，最後美國亦難倖免。今日美國之注意力，全在歐洲，實則蘇聯在歐固已爭取主動，在亞亦正積極導演逐漸擴大之人類悲劇。吾不必言亞洲重於默洲，但亞洲局勢之嚴重，實有甚於歐洲者。美國必須針對蘇聯陰謀，全盤籌算，歐亞幷重，東西兼顧，方可面對現實，挽救危機。　　要之，遠東局勢，關係世界權力均衡者甚鉅，而遠東之安全·和平·與昌盛，又有賴於中美兩國之密切合作。吾人之共同利益與相互了解，實為此種合作基礎。吾人如得諸君協助，當可使美國對中國問題，作進一步之認識，且可使中國達到，當可使美國對中國問題，作進一步之認識，且可使中國達到強盛與民主之目的、強盛的民主的中國，乃為中美黃同利益之保障，亦卽世界永久和平之基石也。市北海上民航劇減　平津糧食受影響　平即將以布至四郊易糧　　〔本報北平十六日電〕平卽開始以布五千疋至四郊易糧。南北海上民航劇减，影響平津糧價甚大。郵局宣佈海運包裹已停收，寄滬者應皆改航空。前日某輪戰麵粉到津，因急調軍用，不及卸完，載所餘四萬袋急急南返。律市府昨將物價黑市電吿翁院長，內稱平民所需玉米麵，已超過限價十倍，平亦報吿張厲生。西單商塲今午在當局派警巡邏下開門，惟顧客是否定按限價購物，商人時在戒懼中，西城錦什坊街一帶飯館，因不時有「吃完就走」之顧客光臨，乃多「堅壁淸野」，掛出「修理內部」擋箭牌。國棉南通聨處　在產區設收購站　　〔本報南通十六日電〕國棉南通聯購處今成立，江南北十六日前所收之花，一律登記，今起停止採購，該處已在南通附近產棉區設四站，卽日收購，並計劃於泰縣·海門·啓東·設立支處，祟明及常淺仍劃歸通區採購。杭物檢委會成立　十九日開始檢查　　〔本報杭州十六日電〕杭市物資檢查委會於十六日成立，並舉行首次會議，經決定首受檢查者爲米麵等十餘種主要物資，檢查方法依據登記檢查，發現未經登記之物資，一律查封，並定十九日廿日兩日檢查，市參會提供意見爲應以登記爲對象，檢查機關應力求統一，不宜按戶檢查。賴欉翰與美官員　在華府會談　　〔中央社華盛頓十五日電〕美經濟合作總署中國分署署長賴樸翰氏，今日與公共顧問委員會委員五人，曁國務院海陸軍部代表會談逾兩小時，會談詳情不悉。按霍夫曼亦曾出席此一會議。但一般預測賴氏已向各委員，國務院及海陸軍部官員，報吿中國政治經濟之現狀，尤於有關援華計劃部份，有所特別叙述，賴氏可望與霍氏晤談後，於十八日發表聲明，說明中國分署之工作進度。司徒立門等擬渝　　定今日參紗廠電廠等　　〔本報重慶十六日電〕司徒立門今起作一週之華西南旅行考查，隨來渝有飽德曼，藍士英，嚴家淦及賴樸翰葛里芬兩夫人等，據司稱目夏季以來卽往各地調查此行視察西南區，願能對中國有貢獻。渠在十一月初將返美，是否再返華，此時無法答復，十二時由盧作孚招待，卽逕百白市驛機塲赴北碚午餐，並考察天府煤礦，晚宿北碚。十七日搭民生公司專輪駛渝，參觀二四兵工廠，豫豐紗廠，電廠，民生公司。晚應楊森歡宴，十八日飛蓉轉灌縣，考察都江水利工程，二十日赴昆，二十二日返滬。　　〔合衆社華盛頓十五日電〕經合總署十五日宣佈分發援外基金一九，三二四，八四〇美元，其中中國佔四，六六九，一四三美元。各煤礦開會決定　設立聨合供應處　　〔本報南京十六日電〕開濼，華東，淮南，台灣等煤礦負責人，十六日上午舉行會議，商討各礦設立聯合供應處，供應烟煤辦法，決定總處設於上海，南京設辦事處，並在其他各要點設立供應站，以後憑烟煤調節委會核准之配煤單，卽可在供應站取煤，惟以後對於每月配煤量，將採分期交貨辦法，上項辦法，已於十六日下午送至工商部，將於十八日第二次烟煤調節委會中提出討論。疏通糧源放行米船　皖米源源運無錫　已有一百餘萬石在途　　〔本報無錫十六日電〕錫邑向爲米糧集結地，現下存糧空虛，對於江蘇軍糟民食大有關係，民食調配會錫分會有鑒及此，特赴皖疏通來源，向第八綏靖區司令部及省府請朮飭屬協助，已將巢縣，含山，盧江等縣米船放行四十餘萬石，其餘合肥舒城，無爲等縣尙有六十餘萬石運錫，巢湖中尙停有空船二千餘艘待運，查合肥之三河，舒城之桃溪，無爲之襄安，均爲大宗秈稻出產地，故疏通後尙有一二批運錫，供應民食。又食油缺乏，黃牛爭相購買，店號擁擠非常，限量出售，又戡建隊頃在南門查獲偷運糧船四艘，抄出紅糧三千餘斤，食鹽三十擔，荳餅四千餘斤，一切扣押。青市民深夜出動　持麵袋高喊購糧　天明始散去一部幸未發生意外　　〔

<p>自由談吃虧？便宜？  索貝　　近旬以來，據說市上情形大大不同了，但是我對經濟上的感覺素來遲鈍，而且口袋也極空虛，所以便沒有考慮到要不要參加「擠」的行列，來享受身份證所賦予的應有權利；人們身份證上早已印鑑累累，而我的却仍潔白如故。　　但今天偶到鬧市中區一蹓躂，我便被人羣擠得沒有容身之地；再看看路上行人儘是一大包一大包地，手無空拳，商店星比往昔利市千倍；這好像民國廿六年左右每逢過年時大家搶購年貨的情景。然而所怪者：店員們却盡屬無精打采，對顧客似有不勝其煩者，橱窗里又只剩下一點一滴的點綴，稍過一會兒，夕陽尙未西下，老闆們竟又板着面孔下逐客令了。　　我站在一家商店的門口呆住了十幾分鐘，我的腦子里開始一問一答地思量了半天。不是說多數人都窮得難以糊口嗎？但是看看今天情景，其誰信之？至少大家已有餘力藏儲非絕對必需品。你譏笑他們儂嗎？他們莫不自詡其「緊急措置」之得當與聰明，因爲他們說這樣便不吃虧了！　　「吃虧」，「便宜」，人生於世，終日忙碌着大都爲了爭取後者；有時候你到遠遠的一家店里買了一件物品，居然便宜了一角或者幾分，心中便有莫大安慰，雖不至馬上心曠體胖，至少可以增進食慾，足見「便宜」之愛好，心同此理。然而他顯然沒有知道時間，體力與車資的消耗，也足以變便宜爲吃虧！　　目前情勢，又臨到人們選擇吃虧與便宜的時候了，人們莫不以爲買進東西總不吃虧，而且人家都買我不買，豈不糟糕？於是：男女老少，闔第出動擠購，有什麽買什麼；由是，一剎那間，老闆們的神經被動地緊張起來了，橱窗里的東西絡續後門跑出去，你偏要買，我偏不願售，你偏不願售，我便非搜購，擠購不可了。如此循環，遂使供過於求的物資，一夜間變成求過於供，求旣過於供，後果就不在話下了。　　人們以爲佔便宜了，却沒想到：這個便宜，顯然將逼使限價的防綫趨於潰決，卽使說限價終須更動，那麼人們自以爲「便宜」的措置，已使限價的更動提前了若干時間。自私者的愚蠢，在這裏找到了最標準的例子！討飯共樣  宋賢　　乞丐討飯，花樣繁多，據我所知，便有「保鏢」，「秀才」，「大花臉」，「孝子」等等。　　有一種乞丐老是跟在人家背後，先生長，太太短，呌個不休，跟了幾條馬路也不罷休的，他們呌做「保鏢」。他們在大熱天便人手一扇，在路人背後搖揮不停。下雨天還會討好似的請行人留心前面的水塘。　　馬路上的吿地狀，乞丐的「同行」却呼爲「秀才先生」。而蹲在人行道上叩頭作揖，裝腔作勢，大聲呼呌的，名呌「大花臉」。他們在乞丐羣中的地位最低，被公認爲「起碼貨色」。　　「孝子」往往身邊帶着一位老態龍鐘的老父或老母，這些「父母」都是「租」來的。每天要付一筆「租金」，他便牽了或背着那老人走，惹人憐憫，因而得到大量的施捨。據說這些「孝子」如果手段高明，收入倒也不壞。　　唱道情的名曰「方卿」。來一套硬功夫的喚做「武狀元」。他們的「功夫」確實驚人：呑鐵彈，穿鍊條，或是把二尺長的鐵劍筆直插到喉嚨裏，隨便走到那一家店舖門口，隨便拿起一隻桌子椅子，都能在鼻尖上頂住，不會跌落。這些「藝術」，若非下過一番苦功，是決不能表演精彩的。　　還有一種瞎眼，爛腿，跛足，啞子等等，其做作更多，但也不容易裝像。裝爛腿的要拜師傳，要吃「生活」，要忍性讓脚上貼牢一層「爛肉」。做瞎子要閉上眼睛，嘴裏不住呼呌「救救瞎子」·能够支待到一天的，到也頗不容易。但爲了生活，也就在所不計了。　　他們的生活是够下賤的，除獲了得路人不屑的一點施捨之外，祇是社會的恥笑。但該恥笑的正是這個社會。惟有該恥笑的社會中，才有這一批「被恥笑」的可憐人！自穗入京  陳樹人遺作　　留穗兩月餘瀕行親友紛相餞別賦謝　　臨分難免重徘徊，一語仍堪慰別杯，已決故鄉終老計，不多時候却歸來。送季女眞魂入京結婚將抵下關作　　送季女眞魂入京結婚將抵下關作　　只因兒女未志情，不是公車赴上京，世態蒼黃經幾變，江山依舊笑　　　　望鍾。　　多變雲烟望眼勞，龍蟠只覺勢仍高，靑衫此日重來客，笑對山靈欲自豪。　　南京晤何邁叔　　雖非離亂話當前，今日逢君意萬千，却喜江南仍好景，舊人無恙李龜年。　　眞魂入京結婚前夕有人屬畫酬潤億金若　　文戲謂此添妝資也口占一首聊當解嘲　　蕭曹家世本寒酸，裙布釵荆儉禮存，果有添妝金一億，敎人嗤我亦豪門玻璃板下  燕支　　我國人常談「觀人於微」，說走路時脚跟不着地者必輕佻，坐時身體歪斜者必不能端謹，諸如此類，花樣繁多，而這些東西雖無科學根據，却往往仍舊在招考職員或口試學生時起着極大的作用。學校裏祗敎學生讀幾何三角之類，却從沒有敎一走相」「坐相」的，眞是一件憾事。有些靑年在找職業的時候，幸蒙公司經理召見，往往在欣喜之餘，接着就是心頭七上八下的暗暗焦急，惟恐臨時「失儀」，造成不良印象，以致使大好的希望成爲泡影——他們之所以恐慌者，一半也就爲了他們都知道社會上獨多的是這種自詡能够「觀人於微」的人。一有恐慌之心，自然到了那時變得靦覥起來，臉也漲紅了，說話也期期艾艾了，明明有能力有熱誠，別人看來却是「太嫩」——碰着不巧的時候，批語竟是「少不更事」，於是乎糟糕。　　匆匆一眼就下太早的斷語，無疑是決不會得到正確的結論的，所以，所謂「觀人於微」這句話，實在應當在被「觀」者的日常生活中下手。一個人無論是怎樣善於做作，日子一長，就不免要漏出破綻。一個賦性疎狂而人綠不好的人，儘管口碑不佳，但是，你有時倒也就在無意中會看出了他是何　　的　　　等的忠誠。　　我有一個朋友，他在某一個大公司担任着相當重要的職務，手下的職員極多，這些職員常常昇遷極速，而且都有眞才實學，沒有一個不是成績極好的。公司裏的董事長有一次就問他，何以他的幹部如此整齊。我的朋友却說，他的幹部也許並不比別人整齊了多少，衹是他喜歡和那些靑年們接近，相知較深，所以任用的時候就有把握了，那位董事長盛讀他有知人之明。　　後來，我就問那位朋友，「你平常是不是也在注意那些職員們的走相坐相之類呢？」因爲，我想讀者諸君已經知道，我是不相信這一套的。　　他說，「走相」和「坐相」倒還無足重輕的，不過公司裏當然不希望有一個時時刻刻用跳舞步伐走來走去的職員。他說，有一件東西最能表示出一個職負的性情和興趣所在。這東西就是寫字檯上的玻璃板。差不多每一個人都喜歡在那塊板下面嵌一些東西，例如：明星的照片，郵票，甚至賬單。如果一個道貌岸然不苟言笑的人，玻璃板下面却放了一張Varga　girl的畫片，那末這位先生就多多少少是苦悶的，心理上一有「化身博士」式的矛盾，他的判斷力就未必靠得住了。也有人天天把應做的事情寫在一張卡片上，做了便一一劃掉，能够每天應做的事情都做好，自然不壞，但有時公司裏蚪他做的事情，他却一再在這張卡片上漏掉了，那麽這個人的可靠的程度就有疑問。有些人在小心剪報——剪的却全是黃色文學……善於作僞的人很多，但是玻璃板下面却往往露出了本來面目。　　我的朋友看見我仍舊表示不信，不禁笑了起來，他說：　　「你放心，我不是一隻警犬。玻璃板下面的世界的確很有趣，你何妨從今天起也來注意一下？」東鱗西爪  咸斯　　最近，英國有一科學考察團，前往北部大西洋探測。他們利用了雷達，想發現一個新的洲。那個洲的名字呌阿脫闌蒂斯（Atlantis），據傳說，它是在八千年前沉到海底的。　　戰前，流行的美鈔以票面十元者最多，但是現在却是票面二十元的最多了，這也是美國通貨膨脹的表徵之一。紅佈告  東方卽白　　直到現在，我國官塲中還有這種陋習：新官上任，必須在衙門口高懸一張紅佈吿。「案奉……令……字第……號內開：茲派……爲……長，等因；奉此，遵於×月×日接印視事，除……外，合和一體週知。此佈。」下面是官銜，姓名，中華民國年月晶，等等。　　這張佈吿的用意，無非呌「一切人等」都知道這衝門的官又換了新的，就等於說：「你們大家注意呀，這裏的官是我做了！」揆之理法，本無不合；但，爲何偏偏要用紅色的？　　我國歷來以紅色象徵顯寵，表示吉慶。十年寒窗，爲的是題名金榜；一旦官運亭通，便可大發財源。威福權勢，吃喝玩樂，一生享用不盡。升官發財本是兩件事，而我國卻早就揉合在一起了。結婚時多用紅色東西作裝飾，祝賀早生貴子；過年時多用紅色東西作裝飾，祝賀日淮斗金；貴呀金的，總是忘不了升官發財。　　一且做了新官，走馬上任，眞生平一大快事，能不大喜過望？於是，第一張佈吿，是大幅紙，正楷字，尤必須採用紅色。　　然而，新時代的官乃人民公僕，一切作爲都是爲了人民。不應該有威福，更談不到發財。假如以爲這次做官，正是大展鴻圖爲民造福的好時機而値得慶賀的話，那也只好在友好打來的賀電中才有：「遙聞吾兄榮膺……大才得展，謹電申賀……」。在新官本身，應時時警惕，反省，堅守崗位，努力奉公，做一個眞正的公僕，以償「大展鴻圖」的宿願。好自爲之猶恐隕越職守，更何能於上任之初，半點政績還沒有，就沾沾自喜，大貼其紅佈告？　　新官第一張佈告用紅色，法無明文規定；爲了表示進步，是否需要等因奉此的來一番嚴令取締呢？　　商人有貨到了不願眞賣而又不得不賣的時候，其作僞取巧之法，大致不出三途：（一）變質，（二）縮量，（三）加價。　　所謂不願賣而又不得不賣的原因，一是官方旣限價，又禁其拒售，是爲被動的；二是自己的生活，原依仗做買賣，開門賠本固不可，關門坐食亦不行，還須出頭掙扎，是爲主動的。所謂變質，例如茶葉原分九等，把上三級蔽起來，而以中三級及下三級勻作九級，而下三級中雄以棗樹葉（平西有種棗葉，與茶葉極相似），紙不見加價，又無觀於門面交易，買賣但　茶味之劣下，不能究其所以然，官方更無法查驗。他如酒內攙水，鷄鴨則宰老瘦者刷洗裝新（但尙無塡水泥之事），皆變其質以充塲。所謂减量，例如賣油條者由「肥腸式」縮爲「麻繩式」，由肥大而細弱，雖賣原價，而量則遞减至三四分之一。麵製品則可用蒸發料使之龐大而虛空，體積照常，而本質大减。至於加價，乃顯然與限價抵觸，不能明加，而偸工减料，卽無異於加價矣。　　卽如牛肉小攤，又充滿街頭，每斤公然大喊「一塊大」，而八一九之原價則法幣「一百六』，以百萬升為一元，十萬　寫一角（伶倡三倍）。　肉鐵歸已久，前　亦在小攤上漸漸出頭，其賣法甚爲奇詭，乃將肉切成碎塊碎片，分爲若干堆（像賣花生及山果一樣），每堆呌賣一元，不論斤，不帶秤，買者若問一堆有幾兩，則笑而不答，只云：這是「堆兒賣」，願買就花一塊錢，包一堆去。有買而回家過秤者，僅五兩之肉，三堆乃够一斤。此等「掩耳盜鈴」，本不難於察辨，但官方似不肯過於認眞。　　糧食無市依然，大多數民衆所恃以餬口之雜合麵，求之於黑市，價格繼漲增高，方興未艾，而供不應求，購買困難·於是白薯（一名地瓜）大走亭運。此物向有糖煮與乾烤兩法，原是一種消閒食品，近則平民購以代糧，三日間價漲數倍，由此想像民生之艱困，不待　言矣。</p>

<h3>Legislative Yuan's Legal Committee Reviews the Civil Servants' Salary Law</h3>
<h3>Relevant Departments to Send Personnel to Attend and Explain</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 16th] The Legislative Yuan committees convened separately on the 16th to handle cases. In the morning, the Legal Committee initially reviewed the draft Civil Servants' Salary Law. The Ministry of Personnel of the Examination Yuan and the Ministry of Interior and Ministry of Finance of the Executive Yuan sent personnel to attend, explain, and answer questions. The committee members expressed dissatisfaction with the fact that our country's official system has not yet been established and that civil servants are both extremely hardworking and have no guarantee of security. They also put forward supplementary and amending opinions on the content of the draft law. The joint group of the Agriculture and Forestry Committee, the Water Conservancy Committee, and the Legal Committee initially reviewed the draft organizational regulations of the Agricultural Census Committee of the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry. Ye Qianji, the director of the Agricultural Economics Department of the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, attended and explained that the establishment of the committee was to prepare for the worldwide agricultural census to be held by the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization in 1950. However, after discussion by the committee members, it was unanimously agreed that the responsibilities of the Agricultural Census Committee listed in the draft organizational regulations could be handled by the original competent departments of the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry. The funding for the census could be obtained after the completion of the legislative process of the Census Regulations. Therefore, it was decided that the draft organizational regulations should not be reviewed. As for the agricultural census work, it is a national matter and should be discussed after the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry has drafted the Census Regulations and sent them to the Legislative Yuan by the Executive Yuan. In the afternoon, the joint meeting of the Criminal Law Committee and the Grain Committee reviewed the draft regulations on punishing crimes against grain management. According to the preliminary review amendments, it was discussed and revised item by item, and passed. It will be submitted to the Legislative Yuan for a public decision.

Some committee members supported the proposal, while others advocated increasing the current land appreciation tax rate and opposed the separate proposal. Finally, it was decided to report to the Legislative Yuan that there are many cases related to land issues, and this case should also be handled together. The two opinions, both supporting and opposing, should be submitted at the same time for the Legislative Yuan to consider.</p>

<h3>China's Anti-Communist War</h3>
<p>By Lai Lian</p>
<p>Today, Eastern Europe behind the Iron Curtain has been controlled by Moscow, and other countries in the world are also under the threat of communism. China has been engaged in a life-and-death struggle with communism for over twenty-five years. Although we have suffered the destruction and disasters caused by the Communist Party, we are confident that in these twenty-odd years of struggle, China has become the vanguard of anti-communism, and the Soviet Union's conspiracy to communize Asia has not yet succeeded in its entirety.</p>
<p>Today, in my capacity as a member of the Standing Committee of the Kuomintang and representing the Chinese people, my defense of China and the Kuomintang is not an attempt to gloss over our faults or deceive friendly nations. China has been invaded by imperialism and has experienced turmoil for over a century. After the eight-year War of Resistance, it suffered a great loss of vitality. The Communist bandits then launched a large-scale military rebellion at this time. Transportation was destroyed, industry and mining were destroyed, cities were looted, and people were massacred, creating unprecedented tragedy and terror in history. The responsibilities borne by the Chinese government and the difficulties it has encountered (as you Americans can imagine if you put yourself in our shoes).</p>
<p>We do not deny that administrative efficiency has not reached the ideal expectations, nor can we deny the decline in production, the withering of people's livelihood, and the general deterioration of the economic situation. However, most of these phenomena were caused by the Communist bandits and are part of the overall plan of Communist International to create poverty, hunger, war, and disaster. This is an ironclad fact, and no matter how good the Communist bandits and their foreign supporters are at propaganda, they cannot deny it.</p>
<p>Some people have been influenced by the Communist bandits' propaganda and think that there should be no more "civil war" in China. In fact, China, like the United States, is a nation that loves peace. If it were not for the Communist bandits acting as accomplices and instigating war, we would never have turned against each other and killed each other. Today, China's resistance to red imperialism cannot be called a civil war. China's struggle is, on the one hand, to seek survival for the nation and independence for the country, and at the same time, it is the most important link in the world's anti-red front. If China were to succumb to red imperialism, the stabilizing force in the Far East would immediately be shaken, and a third world war could break out at any time. If you understand this principle, you will no longer say that China's anti-communist war is a civil war.</p>
<p>We regret the failure of the Marshall Mission. However, if we had accepted the Communist bandits' conditions at that time and established a coalition government, China would have become a second Poland or Czech Republic long ago. The United States now knows that the Communist Party cannot be trusted, but we have had twenty-five years of painful experience. The Kuomintang knew the seriousness of the Communist Party problem twenty years ago, so it once attracted them to join the Kuomintang in order to eliminate the scourge in its infancy. Unexpectedly, after they joined, they harbored evil intentions and conspired to seize power. They implemented the infiltration policy implemented by the American Communist Party today in a meticulous and step-by-step manner. I returned to China from the United States in 1926 and personally witnessed the Communist bandits first expressing cooperation with various moving slogans, and even publicly pledging allegiance to the Kuomintang. Then, on the one hand, they infiltrated party and government agencies with their important members, seized key positions, and on the other hand, they sent their party members to infiltrate all levels of society, farmers, workers, and other groups, clamoring wildly, creating terror, and disrupting order in order to achieve the goal of seizing power. If it were not for President Chiang's foresight and decisive elimination of the Communist bandits, the Kuomintang would have been wiped out twenty years ago!</p>
<p>After the victory of the War of Resistance Against Japan, the United States mistakenly believed that the Communist bandits could be compromised, so there were suggestions of political consultation, military mediation, and even a coalition government. General Marshall's visit to China was to carry out this mission. Marshall was highly respected and admired by the world, and China needed peace and construction, so everyone warmly welcomed Marshall's visit to China, and the government was especially willing to cooperate sincerely and adopt various suggestions.</p>
<p>The Communist bandits insist on the established view of world revolution and will never sincerely compromise with anyone. When their power is weak, they use sweet words to deceive the world. Once their feathers are full, they can betray all promises, sell friends, and sell the country without hesitation. In their minds, there is no concept of law, let alone moral standards. Therefore, the Communist bandits should bear full responsibility for the failure of the Marshall Mission. In fact, the Communist bandits have no sincerity to speak of. Moscow had already decided to undermine it when Marshall's work began. Their strategy: (1) To delay time in order to expand and strengthen the Communist bandits' military position. (2) To provoke the relationship between China and the United States. (3) To place the responsibility for the failure of the negotiations on the government.</p>
<p>We have always regarded President Roosevelt as a friend of China. However, after Germany surrendered, he made a misjudgment on Japan and used the basic rights and interests of the Northeast, which are related to China's survival, as exchange conditions for the Soviet Union to send troops to attack Japan, and satisfied Stalin's imperialist ambitions. As a result, the railway rights were completely lost, and Lushun and Dalian existed in name only. Outer Mongolia was formally recognized as independent. On the one hand, the Soviet Union delayed the date of troop withdrawal, and on the other hand, it dismantled industrial and mining equipment worth US$2 billion. At the same time, it armed the Communist bandits and caused endless chaos, which not only harmed China's survival, but also threatened the security of the United States, destroyed peace in the Far East, and harmed China, the United States, and the whole world. I am not afraid of being verbose and describe this historical error because I want the United States to be vigilant. Today, this scourge is still expanding, and the United States' foreign policy and its policies towards China and the Soviet Union are still hesitating and undecided. I really cannot but worry about the future of the world.</p>
<p>The Communist bandits themselves say that they have no direct relationship with the Soviet Union, and they also claim to be a political party engaged in land reform. In fact, the Communist bandits are a disaster for the country and the people, and can only be called traitors, rebels, or the fifth column. The so-called land reform is nothing more than confiscating all the land in their occupied areas and massacring the peasants who cannot obey them.</p>
<p>Some people think that the Communist bandits have developed rapidly and seem to have gained the support of the people. In fact, the people in their occupied areas are all prisoners without freedom or security. They are driven to fight at any time, or they are enslaved, or they are massacred on the pretext. They use coercion to force people to become soldiers, so they do not have to worry about the lack of soldiers. They also use looting to confiscate people's property, so they do not have to worry about the lack of financial resources. However, the people under their iron-fisted rule are no better than cattle and horses!</p>
<p>I have dealt with the Communist bandits for more than twenty years, and I know their ambitions, strategies, organizational abilities, and propaganda techniques very well. Because I have been engaged in education for many years, I also know how the Communist bandits anesthetize young people and how they tempt young people to commit crimes and betray their motherland. I was the president of National Northwest University, which happened to be in Shaanxi with Mao Zedong's Yan'an government. They often sent party members to infiltrate the university, provoking emotions, inciting student unrest, and creating an atmosphere of terror and social unrest in the school. Fortunately, I took precautions and often stopped the turmoil in advance, so I was able to protect the safety of students and academic freedom.</p>
<p>China's resistance to the totalitarian ideology of communism hopes for the active assistance of friendly countries, but it never slackens its own efforts. No matter how serious the difficulties it encounters, it still moves towards the road of democracy and constitutionalism. The constitution was promulgated the year before last, and a popularly elected government was established this year. I am a member of this popularly elected Legislative Yuan. We know that the current enemy is even more ferocious than Japan, but we will never be discouraged, and we firmly believe that the Communist bandits will fail and China's future is full of light and hope.</p>
<p>In terms of economics, China dares to innovate its monetary system and suppress prices in this difficult time. In less than a month, it has achieved remarkable results. This shows that China is determined to be self-reliant. We believe that from now on, finance can be stabilized and people can live in peace.</p>
<p>Our national construction plan is being implemented step by step in accordance with the Three Principles of the People, especially the Principle of People's Livelihood, which can be called a peaceful and progressive socialism. We advocate restricting capital while protecting private enterprises. We advocate equalizing land rights while allowing private individuals to retain land. The facilities of the British Labour Party are in line with what the Kuomintang advocates. You know that the British Labour Party is a strong force in Europe resisting the Communist Party, so you know that only the Kuomintang's socialist economic policy can eliminate the scourge of the Communist bandits and resist Soviet aggression.</p>
<p>The United States has learned that under the continued offensive of communism, not only is the situation in Berlin becoming increasingly tense, but also the underground work and infiltration policies of its party members make everyone feel that their safety and survival are greatly threatened, and no country is exempt. However, the general perception is still to belittle the crisis of the redization of Asia. Even the peripheral organizations of the Communist Party openly declare that even if the Communist Party obtains political power in China, it will not affect the United States. This is a vicious propaganda instructed by the Soviet Union, and we must expose its conspiracy so that the United States will not be deceived again.</p>
<p>For more than twenty years, the Communist International has never neglected Asia, especially China, which has been plagued by disasters. It has been painstakingly planning and doing everything possible. Asia has long been invaded by Western imperialism, and the living standards of the people are not very high, while the ideology of nationalism is spreading everywhere. In Korea, in Annam, in Burma, in Thailand, in Malaysia, in Indonesia, and even in India, Japan, and the Philippines, Communist propaganda has made considerable progress. It is precisely because China is still able to annihilate the Communist bandits and resist the Soviet Union that the security of Southeast Asian countries can still be maintained. If China is conquered by Moscow, the entire Asia will immediately be redized, and this population of more than 1 billion can be used by the Soviet Union. All Soviet-style intimidation, fraud, terror, and massacres will spread around the world, and democratic politics and modern civilization may be destroyed at any time. I don't know what the United States will do then!</p>
<p>The United States does not want another war, just like China. However, the Communist International insists on enslaving the people of the world with its totalitarian ideology. Anyone who does not bow to its will is regarded as reactionary, stubborn, or a war profiteer. Any appeasement policy can never win peace from the hands of the Communist Party, and at most can only exchange it for the fate of a Beneš or a Masaryk of the Czech Republic.</p>
<p>Today, the only country in the world that truly has the strength to confront the Soviet Union in politics, economics, and military affairs is this wealthy and prosperous United States. However, the American people are fair, respect the law, and do not want war. The Soviet Union uses this weakness of the United States to repeatedly launch attacks on European and Asian countries, either through military force or through propaganda, or by using the veto power in the United Nations, or by instructing the Communist Parties of various countries to betray their motherland and create chaos. The methods used vary from time to time and from place to place, but the ultimate goal is to force other countries to accept the political ideology and style of the Soviet Union. In other words, it wants to conquer the world and enslave mankind with its communism. When the whole of Europe is disarmed and China loses its ability to resist, the United States will be isolated. Even if it has abundant resources and atomic weapons, it may be unable to do anything. Although the United States does not want war, war will inevitably be forced to its doorstep. Has the United States forgotten the lessons of the two world wars?</p>
<p>The Soviet Union has the ambition of world revolution and has a set of interconnected conspiracies against Europe, Asia, and the United States. If the United States does not have a far-sighted and firm world policy to counter it, all democratic and free countries will be swallowed up and defeated one by one, and the United States will not be spared in the end. Today, the United States' attention is entirely on Europe. In fact, the Soviet Union has already taken the initiative in Europe, and is also actively directing a gradually expanding human tragedy in Asia. I don't have to say that Asia is more important than Europe, but the seriousness of the situation in Asia is even greater than that in Europe. The United States must have a comprehensive plan to counter the Soviet Union's conspiracy, and give equal importance to Europe and Asia, and balance East and West in order to face reality and save the crisis.</p>
<p>In short, the situation in the Far East is of great importance to the balance of world power, and the security, peace, and prosperity of the Far East depend on the close cooperation between China and the United States. Our common interests and mutual understanding are the basis of this cooperation. If we can get your help, we can make the United States have a deeper understanding of the Chinese problem, and we can enable China to achieve the goal of strength and democracy. A strong and democratic China is a guarantee of the common interests of China and the United States, and it is also the cornerstone of lasting world peace.</p>
<h3>Sharp Reduction in Maritime Civil Aviation in Northern Jiangsu and Shanghai, Grain Supply in Peiping and Tianjin Affected, Peiping to Exchange Cloth for Grain in the Suburbs</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Peiping, 16th] Peiping has started exchanging 5,000 bolts of cloth for grain in the suburbs. The sharp reduction in maritime civil aviation in the north and south has greatly affected grain prices in Peiping and Tianjin. The post office has announced that it has stopped accepting sea freight parcels, and those to Shanghai should all be changed to air freight. The other day, a ship carrying flour arrived in Tianjin, but because it was urgently needed for military use, it was unable to unload completely, and loaded the remaining 40,000 bags and hurriedly returned south. The Tianjin Municipal Government yesterday telegraphed Director Weng about the black market prices, stating that the price of cornmeal needed by the people of Peiping has exceeded the price limit tenfold. Peiping also reported to Zhang Lisheng. The Xidan Shopping Mall opened its doors this afternoon under police patrol, but it is uncertain whether customers will buy goods at the price limit. Merchants are in a state of fear. Restaurants in the Jinshifang Street area of Xicheng have mostly "fortified themselves" and put up "internal repairs" signs as a shield because they are often visited by customers who "eat and leave."</p>
<h3>Nantong Joint Office of National Cotton Establishes Purchasing Stations in Production Areas</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nantong, 16th] The Nantong Joint Purchasing Office of National Cotton was established today. All</p>
<p>Page 5</p>
<p>National banks are promoting the sale of state-owned enterprise stocks in Hankou, Chongqing, Xiamen, and Xi'an.</p>
<p>〔Report from our newspaper〕The voting for state-owned enterprises has already been issued and sold in the five major cities of Beijing, Tianjin, and Pingjin. As of the 15th of this month, a total of 4,209,100 shares have been sold. It is learned that in order to promote sales, the Central Bank's Treasury Department has also handed over the voting and receipt data for the five regions to China National Aviation Corporation for distribution to its branches in Qingdao, Hankou, Chongqing, Fuzhou, Xiamen, Kunming, and Xi'an, and will also dispatch personnel to Chengdu and Shenyang in the near future for distribution.</p>
<p>It is also learned that the Taiwan Bank, entrusted by the Central Bank to sell the stocks of Taiwan Sugar and Taiwan Paper companies in the province, has reported that sales in Taipei began on the 13th. Sales in Hsinchu, Taichung, Tainan, and Kaohsiung are scheduled to begin on the 18th, and in Hualien and Keelung on the 22nd.</p>
<h3>Export of goods from this city can be applied for legally, but price increases or hoarding are not allowed.</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the responsible persons of the cotton cloth, cotton yarn, oil, sugar, and other trade associations in Beijing and Shanghai held a joint meeting at the Central Bank, presided over by Secretary Cai of the Economic Supervision Office. Mr. Cai stated that the transportation of goods from this city to other areas can be applied for according to the "Measures for Applying for the Export of Prohibited Goods." However, there is one principle: after the transported goods arrive at their destination, they must absolutely comply with the price limits of August 19 and are not allowed to exceed them or hoard them for resale.</p>
<p>Furthermore, according to Mr. Dong Jiufeng, Chairman of the Cotton Cloth Trade Association, the inventory of cotton cloth in Shanghai is very large, with over 7 million bolts currently under investigation by various factories and cloth shops. At present, the Shanghai cotton cloth industry can still produce up to 4 million bolts per month. The supervisors have now decided to allow the cotton cloth industry to export between 2 million and 3 million bolts per month to meet the needs of various regions.</p>
<h3>Export industry faces many difficulties; regular membership meetings will be convened to collect opinions and find ways to improve.</h3>
<p>After the implementation of the new economic policy, the export of goods has become difficult due to loose credit and speculative purchases, resulting in market prices that are ostensibly stable but actually firm. In order to broadly solicit the difficulties encountered by colleagues in the import and export industry in their business operations and find ways to overcome them, it has been decided to convene a membership meeting next Tuesday. After collecting the opinions of all members, improvement measures will be formulated and submitted to the relevant authorities for reference and implementation.</p>
<p>Since the currency reform, due to the failure to thoroughly implement management work in the interior, the export prices of commodities in various production areas have risen, and the export industry has been observing from the sidelines due to high costs, resulting in a recent decline in exports. The Export Management Committee has been closely monitoring this situation and has convened meetings with various export industries in this city to inquire about the difficulties encountered and resolve them individually. Those that cannot be resolved will be submitted to the Executive Yuan for reference.</p>
<h3>"Foreign Exchange" Connotation: Detailed Explanation by National Banks</h3>

<h3>Joint Allocation of Yarn to Private Factories in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, Beijing, and Shanghai</h3>
<p>〔Report from our newspaper〕The cotton spinning associations of private factories in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, Beijing, and Shanghai yesterday conducted the third joint allocation of yarn for the sixth period, allocating 1,025 bales of 20-count yarn. The total amount of cotton cloth opened for sale by various factories was 9,675 bolts, equivalent to 205 bales of 20-count yarn.</p>
<h3>The Textile Construction Company Distributes Cloth as Usual</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the yarn market remained suspended, but retail sales of yarn in the Jinling Road area were still booming. Due to the scarcity of inventory, each person was allowed to purchase only half a bale upon presentation of their identification card. Yesterday, the Textile Construction Company distributed cotton cloth as usual, a total of seven types. Those who applied for (dyed fine cloth) were limited to 38.5-inch 12-pound fine cloth and two types of vice-brand serge. (Price listed in the market price list) Those who (cloth shops at the door) were allocated 12-pound B fine cloth, Taoyuan Garden fine cloth, second-grade 42-inch Four Gentlemen bleached cloth, and five types of plain serge and plain straight tribute cloth. There was also American 001 printed cloth priced at one yuan per meter, 003-014 four-color poplin priced at one yuan per meter, and 003-022 dotted printed cloth priced at 90 cents per foot (limited to one type per household). Many people applied.</p>
<h3>Food Rice Arrives Continuously; Trading Method Is No Longer Based on Viewing Samples and Negotiating Prices</h3>
<p>Yesterday, a total of 1,925.15 dan (石) of food rice arrived in the North and South markets, including 840.65 dan handled by brokers in the South Market, 147.5 dan by rice shops, 513 dan handled by brokers in the North Market, 83 dan by rice shops, and 340 dan by rice mills. The food rice that arrived was either sold directly in stores (shops and mills) or sold on the market. Rice shops could only purchase goods from suppliers with whom they had close relationships, so transactions were not based on viewing samples and negotiating prices as before.</p>
<p>The miscellaneous grains market was almost completely inactive yesterday. Finally, 40 bags of Nanjing snow sesame were purchased by this street, with two bags per household, priced at 30 yuan. Some people in this street were unable to purchase any and left disappointed. Corn, naked barley, and shelled peanuts were not available at all. The second registration for soybeans began yesterday, so there were also no sales.</p>
<h3>Silk Trading Is Quiet</h3>
<p>The raw silk market situation remains very quiet. The quantity distributed by the guild is decreasing daily, and journalists feel that it is insufficient. Due to restrictions at silk shops, there is no way to expand sales, and the market sentiment is firm. Under the price limit, there is no raw silk available on the market. Foreign firms and silk manufacturers have a strong desire to purchase, but holders are watching from the sidelines and not taking action, resulting in no transactions for either domestic or export goods.</p>
<p>In recent days, customer sales have been active, but silk factories are mostly not producing due to difficulties in obtaining raw materials. However, due to the strict inspections by the authorities in recent days, holders are uneasy and selling off goods in the market, mostly unpopular items.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market Is Firm</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market softened slightly because the Taiwan Sugar Company distributed the 23rd batch of box sugar. Sales in this street have been active in recent days, and demand is high, but the quota is limited, so many people are applying. Although the market trading has been changed to a public sales system, people in the industry are still uneasy.</p>
<h3>Cotton Market Is Stable</h3>
<p>There were slightly more cotton transactions yesterday, and some new cotton from the suburbs also arrived. Small-scale yarn factories with low inventories are in great need. There were a few transactions of Zhoupu seed cotton in accordance with the limits.</p>
<h3>Tea Market Trading Is Limited</h3>
<p>Domestic tea trading remained limited yesterday because, in addition to this street and the Suzhou-Wuxi-Changzhou area, there were still purchases, but transportation to Tianjin and other areas in the north was difficult, and Shenzhuang had long since stopped trading. Therefore, the rate of sales has slowed. However, current holders still have some inventory, so supply and sales are fairly average, and the process is still strong. As for the foreign tea market, both imports and exports are rare, and the market is quiet. It is reported that exporters are currently examining the Qimen black tea, which is most loved by the British, and will likely negotiate with sellers next Monday.</p>
<h3>Statistics on Paper Inventory in Shanghai</h3>
<p>According to the Shanghai Paper Trade Association registration office, as of October 12, the actual inventory of paper was as follows: 27,918 reams and 340 sheets of newspaper, 428 rolls of rolled newspaper, 221 reams and 85 sheets of waste newspaper, 770 reams and 163 sheets of domestic newspaper, 1,156 reams of 24x36 newspaper, 11 reams of 25x44 newspaper, 10,599 bundles, 5 knives, and 183 sheets of domestic native-made rough-edged paper, and 18,247 reams and 90 sheets of domestic machine-made rough-edged paper.</p>
<h3>Social Service: Unemployed for Three Years, Livelihood in Despair; Urgently Seeking Employment and Hoping for Sympathetic Assistance</h3>
<p>Dear Editor,</p>
<p>It is now one o'clock in the morning. Having been unable to eat my fill for many days, I am supporting my frail body and writing this letter to you with trembling hands. In recent months, the cold and harsh winds from relatives and friends, and the ubiquitous walls in society, have driven me to the brink of life. What else do I have to be nostalgic for in this world? Now I am placing all my hope in you. I hope to receive assistance from you so that I can continue to struggle on the journey of life.</p>
<p>I have been a loyal reader of your newspaper for more than ten years. Before the war, I was a civil servant. During the war of resistance, I followed the government westward. I endured all kinds of hardships and always adhered to my position, fulfilling my duty as a citizen.</p>
<p>Because I am not good at flattery and bootlicking, I finally suffered the misfortune of unemployment due to the reorganization of the agency in the year of victory.</p>
<p>Three years have passed quickly, and I have not yet found a place to settle down. As I write this, my young child is crying because he cannot suck milk from his mother's shriveled breasts. My heart is about to burst, and I feel a surge of darkness before my eyes.</p>
<p>I can type in English, write in Chinese, and have a basic understanding of accounting. I hope to find a job to support my wife and children.</p>
<p>I await your reply with the utmost urgency. Wishing you peace.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Zou Honglie</p>

<h3>Postal Q&amp;A</h3>
<p>We have received inquiries from (1) Mr. Jiang Zihua, (2) "A Citizen" of this city (21), and (3) Mr. Lou Yongda. We provide brief answers to the points raised below:</p>
<p>Answer: (1) (2) (A) Due to the vastness of the urban area of this city, the same-day delivery area for letters does not yet include Nanshi, Zhabei, and remote areas. Your residence at Xietu Road (from Luban Road to Xinqiao Road) in this city (21) is located in the Nanshi area, so it is not within the current delivery area, which is still to be expanded. (B) Mail is delivered there twice a day, at 8:30 AM and 2:00 PM. Because that location is at the end of the relevant delivery section, the mail arrives later, around 11:00 AM in the morning and around 4:00 PM in the afternoon. (3) After the postal box at the bridge approach on North Tibet Road was damaged, a new box is being manufactured to replace it. However, because the structure of the box is not simple, it will take some time to complete, and it is expected that it will be installed soon.

<h3>Reorganization of Zhongyuan Institute of Technology: Students Petition the Ministry of Education Again; Vice Minister Hang Says Assistance Will Be Provided if Procedures Are Followed</h3>
<p>〔Report from our newspaper, Nanjing, 16th〕Over sixty students from the private Henan Zhongyuan Institute of Technology, including Zheng Heguang, again petitioned the Ministry of Education on the morning of the 16th.</p>
<p>Upon hearing the news, the Eastern District Police Department of the Capital Police Department dispatched police officers to post a notice from the police department in front of the Ministry of Education building, stating that the students had repeatedly gathered to petition in a coercive manner, and that the department could not remain silent in its official capacity and ordered the students to immediately disperse in accordance with Article 149 of the Criminal Law. At the same time, eight legislators from Henan, including Yang Yifeng, were elected by all the legislators from Henan Province to come to the ministry to discuss important matters. They discussed the matter with the Ministry of Education and requested that Vice Minister Hang address the students at 5:00 PM. Vice Minister Hang stated that the Zhongyuan Institute of Technology had not been registered, and the students' academic status was problematic. Considering that they were displaced and out of school, the ministry set up a tutoring class in Zhenjiang to provide relief tutoring. They could take the university entrance examination themselves during the winter vacation, and if admitted, they would be given convenience and their academic status would be recognized. For the remaining students who were not admitted during the winter vacation, tutoring would be extended within a possible range so that they would have the opportunity to take the entrance examination after the summer vacation. Furthermore, the Henan Provincial Government had previously proposed to convert the school into a provincial school. As long as the reorganization plan and budget were processed according to the procedures, the Ministry of Education would provide convenience and assistance. Legislator Yang Yifeng then explained the position of the Ministry of Education to the students, advising them to return and ask Chen Zhiling, a director of the school who came to Beijing, to promote the conversion to a provincial school as soon as possible through proper channels. The students dispersed in the evening.</p>
<h3>National Education Office Inspects National Schools</h3>
<p>〔Report from our newspaper〕Mr. Zhu Junti, Director of the National Education Office of the Municipal Education Bureau, and Mr. Lu Guanliu, Director of the Municipal School Section, departed yesterday to inspect the operations of the national schools in this city. In the morning, they first went to the Hengfeng Road Central National School in the Zhabei District, then to the newly established Jinling National School, and spoke to the students, offering much encouragement. They then went to the Sheng Hui National School to inspect it, giving some instructions on the school environment. They then went to the Song Park National School to inspect the newly built school buildings, and then to the Cao Yuan and Yude No. 2 National Schools to check the number of students, giving detailed instructions on the teaching work. In the afternoon, they went to the Macau Road National School in the Putuo District and the National School in the Old Zha District, as well as the Central National School and the Jin Yuan National School in the Twelfth District. According to Director Zhu, he plans to continue to personally inspect the national schools in the urban area in the coming days.</p>
<h3>Normal College in Beiping Reverted to University: Approved by the Political Affairs Conference</h3>
<p>〔Report from our newspaper, Nanjing, 16th〕Regarding the restoration of the Beiping Normal College to a normal university, Vice Minister Hang told reporters that it was carefully discussed at the Political Affairs Conference on the morning of the 16th. President Weng and the Political Affairs Committee members believed that the normal university had its history and achievements in the past, and the current departments also had the scale of a university, which was different from newly established or reorganized universities. Therefore, they unanimously decided to approve the restoration of the original name. The government's decision not to establish new universities in the near future remains in effect.</p>

<p>Free Talk: Losing Out? A Bargain? Subei</p>
<p>In recent weeks, it is said that the situation on the market has changed dramatically, but my sense of economics has always been slow, and my pockets are extremely empty, so I have not considered whether to join the "squeeze" to enjoy the due rights given by the identity card; people's identity cards have long been covered with imprints, but mine is still as white as before.</p>
<p>But today, when I occasionally strolled into the bustling downtown area, I was squeezed by the crowd and had no place to stand; looking at the pedestrians on the road, they were all carrying large bags, their hands were not empty, and the stores were a thousand times more prosperous than in the past; this was like the scene of everyone rushing to buy New Year's goods around 1937. However, what is strange is that the shop assistants are all listless, as if they are overwhelmed by the customers, and the windows only have a little bit of decoration left. After a while, before the sun has set, the bosses are already wearing stern faces and issuing eviction orders.</p>
<p>I stood in front of a store for more than ten minutes, my mind beginning to think and answer myself for a long time. Isn't it said that most people are so poor that it is difficult to make a living? But looking at the scene today, who would believe it? At least everyone has the spare capacity to hoard non-essential goods. Do you ridicule them? They all boast of the appropriateness and cleverness of their "emergency measures," because they say that this way they won't lose out!</p>
<p>"Losing out," "a bargain," people are born into this world, busy all day mostly to strive for the latter; sometimes you go to a distant store to buy an item, and it turns out to be cheaper by ten cents or a few cents, and you feel greatly comforted, even if it doesn't immediately make you feel relaxed and fat, at least it can improve your appetite, which shows that the love of "a bargain" is the same for everyone. However, he obviously did not know that the consumption of time, physical strength, and transportation costs is enough to turn a bargain into a loss!</p>
<p>The current situation is once again when people choose to lose out or get a bargain. People think that buying things will never be a loss, and if everyone else buys and I don't, wouldn't that be terrible? So: men, women, old, and young, the whole family is mobilized to squeeze and buy, buying whatever they can; as a result, in an instant, the bosses' nerves are passively tensed up, and the things in the windows continuously run out the back door, you insist on buying, I refuse to sell, you refuse to sell, then I must search and buy, squeeze and buy. This cycle has caused goods that were once in excess of demand to suddenly become in short supply, and once demand exceeds supply, the consequences are obvious.</p>
<p>People think they have gotten a bargain, but they didn't think that this bargain will obviously force the price limit defense line to collapse. Even if it is said that the price limit must eventually change, then people's self-proclaimed "bargain" measures have advanced the price limit change by a certain amount of time. The foolishness of selfish people has found the most standard example here!</p>
<p>Beggars' Ways Song Xian</p>
<p>There are many tricks for beggars to beg for food. As far as I know, there are "bodyguards," "scholars," "painted faces," "filial sons," and so on.</p>
<p>There is a kind of beggar who always follows behind people, constantly calling "Mr." and "Madam," following them for several blocks without stopping. They are called "bodyguards." They hold a fan in their hands in the hot weather and wave it behind passersby. On rainy days, they will even ingratiatingly remind pedestrians to be careful of the puddles ahead.</p>
<p>The "colleagues" of beggars who prostrate on the road and lodge complaints are called "scholars." Those who squat on the sidewalk, kowtow, gesticulate, and shout loudly are called "painted faces." Their status among beggars is the lowest, and they are generally recognized as "cheap goods."</p>
<p>"Filial sons" often bring an old and frail old father or mother with them. These "parents" are all "rented." They have to pay a sum of "rent" every day, and he leads or carries the old man, arousing pity and thus receiving a lot of alms. It is said that if these "filial sons" are skilled, their income is not bad.</p>
<p>Those who sing Taoist songs are called "Fang Qing." Those who perform hard martial arts are called "Martial Scholars." Their "kung fu" is truly amazing: swallowing iron pellets, piercing chains, or inserting a two-foot-long iron sword straight into their throats. They can pick up any table or chair at the entrance of any store and balance it on the tip of their nose without it falling. These "arts" cannot be performed brilliantly without a lot of hard work.</p>
<p>There are also blind, rotten-legged, lame, and dumb people, etc., whose pretenses are even more numerous, but it is not easy to pretend to be lifelike. Those who pretend to have rotten legs have to apprentice and be taught, they have to eat "living" and endure having a layer of "rotten flesh" stuck to their feet. Those who pretend to be blind have to close their eyes and constantly shout "Save the blind." It is not easy to endure for a whole day. But for the sake of livelihood, they don't care.</p>
<p>Their lives are low enough. In addition to receiving a little alms that passersby disdain, they are only the ridicule of society. But the society that should be ridiculed is this one. Only in a society that should be ridiculed are there these "ridiculed" pitiful people!</p>
<p>From Guangzhou to Beijing: Chen Shuren's Posthumous Works</p>
<p>Leaving Guangzhou for more than two months, relatives and friends gave farewell banquets, expressing thanks</p>
<p>It is inevitable to linger and hesitate before parting, one sentence is still enough to comfort the farewell cup, I have decided to end my days in my hometown, but I will return in no more than a while.</p>
<h3>Sending My Youngest Daughter, Zhenhun, to Beijing for Marriage, Written Upon Arriving at Xiaguan</h3>
<p>Sending My Youngest Daughter, Zhenhun, to Beijing for Marriage, Written Upon Arriving at Xiaguan</p>
<p>Only because the children's aspirations are not yet fulfilled, it is not by public transport that I go to Beijing, the world situation has changed several times, the rivers and mountains still laugh at my watching.</p>
<p>Watching the ever-changing clouds and smoke is tiring, only feel that the dragon's coiled posture is still high, a guest in green robes comes again today, smiling at the mountain spirits, wanting to be proud.</p>
<p>Meeting He Maishu in Nanjing</p>
<p>Although we are not talking about the current situation of turmoil and separation, I feel countless emotions when I meet you today, but I am happy that Jiangnan is still a beautiful scene, the old people are still safe, like Li Guinian.</p>
<p>The night before Zhenhun went to Beijing to marry, someone asked for a painting and offered a reward of one hundred million gold, if it could be used as a dowry, I casually wrote a poem to relieve my self-deprecation</p>
<p>Xiao Cao's family background was originally poor, the skirt was made of cloth, and the hairpin was made of branches and thorns, frugally preserved, if there is one hundred million gold for the dowry, people will laugh at me as a rich family</p>
<h3>Under the Glass Plate Yanzhi</h3>
<p>Our people often talk about "observing people in the small," saying that those who do not touch the ground with their heels when walking are certainly frivolous, and those who sit with their bodies crooked are certainly not upright, and so on, with many tricks. Although these things have no scientific basis, they often still play a very important role in recruiting employees or interviewing students. Schools only teach students geometry and trigonometry, but never teach "walking posture" or "sitting posture," which is truly a pity. Some young people, when looking for a job, are fortunate enough to be summoned by the company manager, and often, in addition to joy, they are secretly anxious, fearing that they will temporarily "lose their manners" and create a bad impression, causing their great hopes to become a bubble - the reason why they panic is partly because they all know that there are many people in society who claim to be able to "observe people in the small." If there is a heart of panic, naturally they become shy at that time, their faces also turn red, and their speech is also hesitant, obviously having ability and enthusiasm, but others see them as "too young" - when encountering misfortune, the comment is actually "young and inexperienced," and then it's bad.</p>
<p>Making too early a judgment with a hasty glance will undoubtedly not lead to a correct conclusion. Therefore</p>

<h3>National Army in Western Liaoning Attacks Xinlitun: Jinzhou Battle Concludes</h3>
<p>[Our Shenkuo Office, 16th] The Northeast military is unfolding its operations smoothly under the established decisions. The Western Route Army, divided from Zhangwu and around Gehe, jointly attacked Xinlitun, a transportation hub of the bandits. After capturing the outer strongholds on the 15th, they launched a powerful attack on Xinlitun. The remnants of the Fifth Column of bandits, the entire Sixth Column, and part of the Tenth Column were deployed in the area between Zhangwu and Xinlitun, hoping to prevent the westward advance of the National Army. They are currently engaged in fierce battles with the National Army at Shunshanbao, Kaoshantun, and Sijianfang. Furthermore, west of Jinzhou, the bandits used the strength of two columns to block the National Army's eastward advance towards Jinzhou west of Gaoqiao. According to the Northeast Pacification Headquarters, the National Army and the bandits are currently engaged in fierce battles at Shangkanzi, north of Tashan.</p>
<p>[Our Shenyang Office, 16th] In the Jinzhou urban area, the bandits climbed onto rooftops in the moonlight on the night of the 15th and broke through the core positions of the defending troops, bringing the Jinzhou defense war to an end.
