<h3>趙炳玉談話</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十二日電〕趙炳玉博士於記者招待會中暢談中。韓關係，並答復關於韓國現狀之問題。渠首闡述此行任務爲代表李承晚總統，向蔣總統致敬，並答謝中國政府及人民四十餘年來對韓國爭取獨立之協助與同情。中國曾保護各地留華韓僑，使彼等安全過活，並從事復國工作。蔣總統在開羅會議時及中國代表在聯合國赴韓代表團中，均對韓國之獨立有決定性之支持與同情。渠稱：韓國成立獨立政府後之首要工作，爲使全國經濟復興，社會安定，並進行南北統一，以自蘇聯手中拯救北韓人民，韓政府將克服一切困難，達成此目的，盼能繼續獲得中國政府及人民之同情。至此，渠指出中國仍有少數人對南韓政府之成立有不甚了解之處，某大報且著論批評，不無微詞，實則韓國爲其自由獨立及安定復興，應有其自主之政府成立，然蘇聯拒不放棄以韓國爲其均勢據點之政策，使聯合國韓國委會亦不能完成南北韓之統一工作，南韓選舉之公開自由，爲聯合國赴韓代表團工作人員所親見，南韓政府絕非所謂傀儡政府。渠曾於一九二六年一度來華，此次再來，如覺重歸鄉里，渠幼時讀書，卽崇景孔孟先哲，來華後，名城古跡更難忘懷。渠强諷中韓有相同之文化傳統及相同之問題，兩國奮鬥之目標亦復一致，希望今後共同爲亞洲之　榮及世界之和平民主努力。渠旋於答覆記者問題時，坦白承認倘美。蘇兩國駐軍自韓國撤退，內戰可能爲難以避免者，南韓政府雖將致力於國內之統一，但決無意採用武力，但中韓共黨早已勾通，韓國內部問題之不能獲致和解，一如中國所遭遇者。蘇聯如仍繼續其征服世界企圖，前途殊難樂觀。南韓現有訓練極佳之武裝警察大萬人，北韓共黨之武力，因得蘇聯培植，較為強大。關於美國駐軍，渠謂：美國並無領土野心，駐軍不致傷及主權，韓國與美方已就駐軍事成立臨時協議，是項協議即將提出於巴黎舉行之聯大三次會討論。至日韓關係，因四十餘年之敵對仇視，韓人今日猶不免有憎惡之感，然待和約簽訂後，韓政府仍將從事兩國關係之修睦。韓人對美國扶植日本，亦具戒心，咸盼麥帥對日勿過於寬放縱容其重建武力。最後，趙氏復對祈盼中國之獲致太平般殷致意。</p>

<p>社論</p>
<h3>老百姓的上海！</h3>
<p>昨天上海區經管督導貝蔣經國氏在靑年軍聯誼會上，對數千羣衆，發表熱血沸騰的演說。他大聲疾呼地指出：上海需要變，而且正在變，相信一定可以變得通。他說，上海不是一個風平浪靜的上海，而是要經過相當時期的狂風暴雨，但老百姓必須經得起風浪，迎接這轉變。他決心爲老百姓做「當差」，剷除社會蟊賊，使這一個「冒險家的樂園」，變成老百姓的上海。</p>
<p>從幾千羣衆在一小時裹鼓掌歡呼的熱烈情緒中，我們看出老百姓的眞誠。老百姓對於這一位有勇氣來領導經濟革命運動的蔣督導員，幾乎已經把他看成傳奇小說中的人物了。不過我們要認淸：這種經濟革命的完成，不能只靠一位傳奇式的英雄，而須賴於廣大羣衆的協力。</p>
<p>的確，中國現在應該有一番大變革，不但上海而已。我們盼望上海眞能成爲老百姓的上海；我們更盼望整個中國都能成爲老百姓的中國。中華民國本來應該是老百姓的中國，可是爲什麽直至昨天我們纔聽到這一句「老百姓的上海」的呼聲呢？其故可以値得我們的深思。</p>
<p>上海，在意大利某作家的筆下。寫成了「冒險家的樂園」，一向上海彷彿瀰漫着烏烟瘴氣，漆黑一團。其實，上海如果毫無足取，那麽上海也不値得如批重視的了。政府之所以重視上海，就因爲上海有其領導的地位，有其對於國家貢獻的地位。上海有其黑暗面，也有其光明面，正如整個中國也有其黑暗面與光明面。上海所需要變革的，就是廓淸它的黑暗，發揚它的光明。我們要在狂風暴雨之中，掃盡烏烟瘴氣，還它一個光天化日。</p>
<p>同樣是上海，在「八一九」以前，常常遭受全國的唾駡，而「八一九」以後直至今天，短短三星期，却受到全國的正視。成都有「快跟上海學習」的呼聲，北平貼出「向上海看齊」的標語，廣州也有人說「上海所做到的廣州也能做到」。這都是上海的光榮！而這光榮是二十天以來蔣督導員所領導的「變」，帶給我們上海人的。老百姓眼中的上海，今天雖還在狂風暴雨的前奏時期，却相信光天化日一定快會到來。各地的政府和人民，果眞大家能向上海學習，向上海看齊，做到上海所做到的一切，那麽老百姓不但自己掌握了上海，而且老百姓也將有一天確實掌握了中國。本來，上海是有領導全國的作用的，上海老百姓以全力來支持這一變革，上海的光榮是可以長久保持下去。</p>
<p>老百姓現在用萬分的熱忱，擁護蔣督導員書厲風行的鐵腕政策，推行這一次的改革，是毫無疑問的。最天眞的是老百姓；最純潔的也是老百姓。老百姓目前心目中所希望的上海與中國，祗是一個物價穩定，民生安樂的上海與中國，並無多大的奢望，而欲求其定，求其安，尋根究底只是「法治」二字而已·無論戡亂也好，建國也好，一切政治·軍事·經濟的設施，不問其或寬或猛，或張或弛，總不能不運用法律作爲撥亂反正的工具。「治亂世，用重典」，這是人人所知道的成語，而所謂重典，還是在「法」的範圍以內·上海老百姓希望打老虎，希望捉黃牛，希望拍蒼蠅，凡一切違法犯紀之徒，不論奸商·貪官·土豪·劣紳·一槪繩之以法，必使他們伏法正刑而毫無怨言，纔是法律的勝利，纔是老百姓的勝利，要使過去，超越法外的豪門巨室，一旦須與販夫走卒同等受制於法律之前，這纔是正義，纔是公道，纔是老百姓所希望的光天化日的世界。</p>
<p>「八一九」的財政經濟緊念措施令，是中國最急切需要的經濟革命的開始，只許成功，不許失敗·老百姓一方面切望執行政策的當局，由中樞而至於地方，不僅上海一地，全站在人民大衆的家塲，嚴格的依法辦理，沒有絲毫的通融。法律本來是爲了維護大多數人的利益而制訂的，故執行法律就是保護大多數人的利益·法律應該是最公平而無私的，不能因犯者之爲販夫走卒而故重其刑，不能因犯者之爲豪門巨室而故寬其罰，反之亦復如此。老百姓今天別無奢望，只望政府當局全都根據緊急措施令內所指定的各種法律，處罰一切違法犯紀之徒，使此「胃險家的麋園」永遠變成法治的上海，老百姓的上海。我們站在老百姓的立傷，歡呼蔣督導員這一個號召，迎接着「老百姓的上海」的來臨！</p>

<h3>金門島發現鋁鑛　台鋁公司決試掘　閩粵沿海一帶必有更多鋁鑛</h3>
<p>〔中央社台北十二日電〕台灣鋁業公司近在福建金門島發現高級鋁鑛，並已決定試行採掘，運台煉鋁，該公司過去依賴南洋之鋁礦，作爲原料，去年入口一萬噸，今年七月，原擬開採福建漳浦之鋁礦，該公司所派人負及陪同赴閩之美國雷諾金屬公司地質專家史密德曼，乘機飛抵厦門附近時，俯視金門島，竟於無意中發現紅土分佈區城甚廣，且因該地氣候適宜於鋁礦之生成認爲該島有藏有鋁礦之可能，遂卽派遣工程師喬振離氏，前往該島實地測勘，採掘樣品化驗後，證明確爲鋁礦，且其品質較漳浦爲優。估計藏量約達十一萬噸。該公司頃已設立試行採掘機構。據該公司稱：金門島鋁礦品質，與南洋所產者極爲近似，適合於拜耳氏法提煉，惟氣化鋁含量稍低，矽酸（Sio2）含量則稍高，故提煉時，所用礦量較南洋礦略多，計每煉純鋁一噸，約需南洋礦砂四噸，用金門島礦砂則將需五噸，又因矽酸較高，提煉時燒碱消耗亦將較多。計煉鋁一噸約多消耗量燒碱五成，對於該公司之生產成本，不無稍增，然因可節省外匯，仍有採掘價値，按金門島距離厦門僅三十公量，往來船隻甚便，治安亦佳。由於漳浦及金門島現均先後發現鋁礦，該公司認爲閩粵沿海一帶，一定尙有其他地方藏有更多之鋁礦。</p>

<p>〔合衆社柏林十二日電〕柏林史上最偉大之紅色示威，令日在魯斯伽登廣塲舉行聲中，數百條血肉築威之長列，蠕蠕如百川朝宗，向廣塲集中。高唱共產國際歌，十一時半左右，二萬德人已抵達位於市中心區，昔日以景色幽美著稱之「菩提樹下大街北端之廣塲。</p>
<p>空際略有微風，掠人鬢鬚，巨大之紅旗卽在微風中懶洋洋舒展。紅色小棋數百面，旗上多有蘇聯之鎌鎚標誌，則擎於示威人手中。魯斯伽登廣塲在蘇佔區內，而係示威之傳統好地點。五一勞工節共黨發動八萬人大示威，亦假座該地。此次大會適與蘇聯示意之「法西斯主義下犧牲者一大會互相配合。</p>
<p>〔中央社析林十一日電〕據消自靈通人士稱：共黨所支持之羣衆大侖，雖決定係爲紀念一法西斯主義下之犧牲者一，事實上無疑將以示威之姿態出現，其用意爲針對兩日前之反共示威。此一集會或且可能卽爲奪取柏林政權之共黨政變。本日透籌渠等擬向大會提議要求取消目前社會民主黨居多數之柏林市政府，代之以「進步政權」。聞示威者於通過決議案後將列隊赴市府，民選之新市政府卽將於該處成立。觀察家認爲此類計劃有其可能性，蓋與一般共黨方式符合一致也。然渠等認爲西方佔領國仍在柏林城之四分之三，在此種情况下殊不知共黨人如何能於整個柏林奪取政權。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社柏林十一日電〕美軍政府禁止為紀念法西斯主義下犧牲者舉行任何儀式，然蘇區軍政府長官柯蒂哥夫則邀請「柏林法西斯主義下犧牲者協會」在蘇區舉行展覽會。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社柏林十一日電〕蘇軍政府情報局長杜爾巴諾夫上校今日在「法西斯主義下犧牲者」紀念會席上發表演講稱，「由於英法反動者之協助，遂使柏林有強大之反動勢力與進步力量，作頭強之鬥爭，在紐約受三K黨控制之同時，柏林法西斯份子乃可能起而撕毀蘇聯之紅旗，柏林之事件實僅爲世界各地所發生之同類事件之縮影。余誠非一外交家，然余爲一反法西斯戰士，蘇聯之力量已摧毀第三帝國之戰爭機構，其必能摧毀企圖組織第四帝國之勢力殆無疑義」。</p>
<h3>延緩拆卸德工廠　英表示反對</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社倫敦十一日電〕英政府已反對接受美國所提延緩拆卸西德各工廠之建議。據負責方面稱，此因（一）延緩賠償或减少拆卸工廠，似將於馬歇爾計劃受惠國發生重要之反響，因彼等依賴德賠款以供復興之用。（二）减少拆卸工廠必將因以增加德工業之潛能力，而危及諸鄰國。（三）英政府認爲德國若干工廠現所以閒閉者，因缺乏原料之故，今若移至有充足原料之各國，則能復行開工。</p>

<h3>真納傳略</h3>
<p>— 本報資料室</p>
<p>巴基斯坦國的創造者，第一任總理眞納，已於本月十日深度逝世於喀拉蚩，享年七十一歲。</p>
<p>眞納與甘地同爲印度近代史上最重要的人物，他們所代表的宗敎不同，政治主張尤相歧異，但其爲印度國家謀取獨立自由之心，則並無二致。印度脫離英國而獨立後，分成兩個國家，印度國與巴基斯坦國。巴基斯坦的分治，乃是眞納畢生努力的目標。</p>
<p>眞納於一八七六年聖誕節生於喀拉蚩，少年時赴英留學，年二十，卽執行律師業務。返印後，於一九一六年被推爲全印回敎聯盟主席，此後，他卽成爲全印回敎徒的政治領袖，曾參加一九二九年討論印度問題的英印圓桌會議。</p>
<p>眞納最重要的理想，是印度境內回敎人民的自治。他認爲，由於回敎徒和印度敎徒在宗敎及生活方式上的種種不同，若不分治，必難得到完美的結果。這點，他與甘地的主張正相反，因爲甘地是主張統一的。眞納對於印回分治的主張堅持甚力，幾經挫折，終吿成功。去年八月十五日，印度脫離英國而獨立，回敎的巴基斯坦國於是亦吿　生了。</p>
<p>眞納身材修長，面容嚴肅，一望而知爲一沉着幹課的政治家。他常服西裝，家居生活十分撲素。眞納夫人已去世多年，他的女兒因婚後信奉基督敎，已與他脫離關係。眞納暮年只與其妹同住於喀拉蚩，今年年初，卽傳聞其健康情形日見衰退，今乃溘然長逝。</p>

<h3>戡亂宣傳總隊　擴大廣播宣傳　市民還須努力　完成三項革命</h3>
<p>本市欲亂宣傳總隊，爲協助政府推行改革幣制，肅淸匪謀，厲行節約起見，特於昨日假座上海電台舉行擴大宣傳，全市各公營民營電台於下午二時至四時廣播演講時閒內，一律轉播。首由國民黨市黨部方主委廣播，略謂：（一）改革幣制，實施已有二十多天，情形頗稱良好，但我們仍須嚴防少數奸商暗中抬高物價，企圖黑市復活，現在大家都擁護蔣督導員打老虎，但蔣先生是來督導我們從事打虎工作的，實際的打虎工作，還須我們全市民衆一致在他的領導之下，共同努力。同時打老虎非爲政府打而是爲民衆自己打，而且打老虎必須要打得澈底，要打得它死，否則老虎復活，仍可吃人。</p>
<p>厲行節約貢獻戡建</p>
<p>（二）上海除奸商外，還有共匪陰謀份子潛伏市塲，興風作浪，抬高黑市，破壞幣制，今天共匪與奸商已成一片，因此必須同時肅淸匪諜，才能穩定物價，安定民生。（三）改革幣制而不厲行節約，結果仍不能成功，我們應愛惜物力，財力，人力，時間，來貢獻戡亂建國，從而充裕物資，使物價穩定。最後方氏結論，改革幣制是當前的經濟革命，肅淸匪諜，肅淸貪汚，是政治革命，全面節約是生活革命，要三點都做到成功，必須上海同胞首先澈底舉行，爲全國模範，這是上海同胞的責任，也雜上海同胞的光榮。</p>
<p>消弭亂源案定社會</p>
<p>繼由吳市長代表王兆荃播講，略謂：「天下興亡，匹夫有責」，國民不應放棄顧問國事的權利，也不應規避奉行國策的義務，改革幣制是適應時代需要，關係搬亂成敗，大家必須竭誠擁議，完全信任，使新幣制底於成功。次由中央銀行俞總裁代表范鶴言播講：我們必須肅淸共匪，以及喪心病狂私自利囤積居奇的奸商，嚴防其破　新幣制，同時要改善社會經濟，必須節約消費，以富有階級節省的物資來分配給多數無法生存的人民，這是消弭亂源，安定社會的必要條件。</p>
<p>各項節目頗多精彩</p>
<p>次再由王曉　播講，略謂：共匪是急性的殺人犯，奸商是慢性的殺人犯，我們必須除此兩大禍審，才能生存，並勸吿全市人民厲行節約。此外，金振王等亦分別播講，情飼均極懇切。至各項節目，頗多精彩，有該總隊自編各項擁護政府改幣，肅奸，節約之開　等。</p>
<h3>警權統一紀念大會　宣司令指示三點　勗勉應愛護人民</h3>

<p>〔本報訊〕青年軍聯誼會。昨晨九時假陝西南路市體育館舉行會員大會，並請經濟督導員蔣經國。國民黨市黨部主委方治，蒞會演講。到會復員靑年軍二千餘人，及聞訊自動來體育館參加之市民數千人。後來者因會塲不能容納，大部份均　集陜西南路林森中路馬路上，以聆取體育館門前擴音器中播送之演講詞。蔣氏於會中痛斥食官污吏，豪門奸商，並堅決聲述新經濟政策必能成功之信心，言詞慷慨激昂，與會軍衆，頻頻報以如雷　聲，會塲情緒之興奮熱烈，爲從來所未見。將方詞畢，大會通過組織靑年服務國草案及上總統電。十一時二十分，大會於樂聲及口號聲中結束。將經國退出會塲，聯誼會會負以導聲相送，體育館門外數千民衆更瘋狂歡呼。陜西南路交通早已阻塞，閘北區居民數百人持旗幟鑼鼓，列隊相迎，呼聲掌聲震動屋宇·蔣氏上車前復受民衆包圍，市民對蔣氏擁護愛戴之眞誠，昨晨在體育館前表現無餘。此種情况，僅於勝利後總統首次蒞滬在市府陽台上接受民衆歡呼時見之。</p>
<p>不應過份享受</p>
<p>蔣氏演講詞，首先指出我國之貧窮，人民不應作過份之享受以裝富。渠稱：我年輕時候，見人家天天吃肉，我家沒有，祖母吿訴我，人家有錢，我家沒錢。現在我們國家亦正如此，我國貧窮，大多數人衣食不足，然而却有人坐不應該坐的汽車，享受不應該享受的物質，外國香水，玻璃絲襪，這些東西，都足以破壞我們的國民經濟。我們窮，窮並不可怕，爲什麼要裝富？但現在有一班人被黃金，美鈔，外國貨所麻醉，而忘記了民族國家，就以上海來說，能窮奢極慾恣意享受的究有幾人？絕對少數，我們的國家不容讓這些少數人來破壞，此種不肖的炎黃子孫，我們要一個個殺掉。</p>
<p>中國之生存　賴民族正義</p>
<p>中國所以能生存到現在，因爲有一種潛在的民族正氣，決不屈服於敵人，麼史上不乏先例，如文天祥，史可法，岳飛。國家民族每至生死存亡最後關頭，全民奮起，把敵人打倒。「七七」事變日本以那麼大的力量，向我們挑戰，我們不顧一切的抗戰，終於把日本打倒。共匪執行他國的政策，破壞統一和平，我們亦絕不能與之妥協。有些人懷疑爲什麼我們不能組成聯合政府呢？是的，我們不會上共願的當，捷克可以變成今日的捷克，羅馬尼亞可以變成今日的羅馬尼亞，保有光榮的民族傳統精神的中國，決不能變。</p>
<p>新經濟政策　危機中轉機</p>
<p>抗戰時候我在西康省的西昌，見那裏建築着許多很好的政府機關房屋，我感到非常奇怪，後來領袖吿訴我，這些房屋備重慶撤退時用的。中國抗戰以弱禦强，我們有決心，堅持到底，卒獲勝利。自前是中華民族的危機，亦是轉機，新經濟政策的頒布是危機中的轉機，新經濟政熒是社會性的革命，是民生主義的開始，我們要集中已散漫了的力量，來完成它。上海以前是冒險家的樂園，現在已開始在變了，我們要它變下去，非變通不可。投機市塲，奸商囤積，我們都不容許在上海存在。三民主義保障私人財產，私人企業，過去如此，今天如此，將來亦如此，但是囤積，投機，剝削大衆的奸商，必須剷除。奸商曾經勾結貪官，是的，戚再玉便是一個例，今後誰貪汚，誰就得槍斃。上海是全國經濟的中心，我們必須先克服上海的反動經濟力量，才能安定全國的經濟。</p>
<p>與惡勢力　捕鬥到底</p>
<p>新經濟政策在上海已得到五百萬市民的擁護與信仰，過去三星期中，第一個星期奸商卽企圖破壞限價，第二個星期黃金，美鈔，紗布黑市出現了。我逮捕了幾個奸商，抄出了許多囤貨，第三個星期就平靜下來。足證物價高漲並非完全是經濟原因，是可以政治力量克服的，如今反動經濟主力沒有消滅，上海經濟前途正是狂風暴雨的前夕，然而我們不恐懼，不勸搖，決與惡勢力搏鬥到底。</p>
<p>民生是什麽</p>
<p>我把幾個大資本家關起來之後，有人設我不民主，民主是什麼？拿大多數人的力量把少數人壓下去才是民主。民主是爲多數人說話，不是爲少數人享受。榮鴻元被捕之後，資本家的走狗散播謠言，說五萬人靠地吃飯，今後都將失業。笑話，他才是靠五萬人發財的。政府沒收許多囤貨後又有人說政府雜强盜。我們抄獲的貨物中，有囤積了三年以上的，這些貨物已不是商品，而是他們搗亂市塲的工具，剝削人民的利器，他們一轉手間賺了幾百萬美金，搶大多數人的錢這才是强盜。又有人說我這樣下去工廠將關門，政府有的是人民的力量，爲什麼不可以接收。</p>
<p>硬幹苦幹實幹</p>
<p>最後蔣氏供獻給靑年軍聯會會員三點：（一）要硬幹不要　幹，（二）要苦幹不要瞎幹，（三）要實幹不要胡幹。又指出「無商不奸」的成語，沒殺了大多數善良的商人，不能成立。復糾正「打老虎」與「蔣靑天」兩句話，因前者是個人的英雄主義，而現在是集中大多數人的力量向惡勢力鬥爭，後者是封建思想的餘孽，官吏是百性的公僕，為民除害正是應該，並稱：現在不雜圖痛快，而是有計劃的做，我們要把冒險家的樂園，變成上海人的樂園。</p>
<h3>工礦建設協進會　茶會歡迎陳立夫</h3>

<p>「鎳禍」在成都  本報記者周學端　　〔本報成都七日航訊〕自從財政經濟緊急處分令公佈，在成都引起普遍良好一反應，全川人民，熱烈擁獲中櫃這劃時代的經濟改革。但不幸緊接改幣之後，來了新舊鎳幣通用的浪潮，激盪成都整個市塲，引起空前社會混亂，這是一般人所說的「鎳禍」，這裏面包括：主持經濟管制者的空前舞弊，投機暴發，百物搶購，市塲無價無市種種怪現象，這是經濟戡亂中最不合理現象。　　通用鎳幣　　所請新舊鎳幣，計包括中央造幣廠目民廿六年至卅年歷年所鑄銅幣（一分），鎳幣（五分，十分，廿分），合金幣（五分，十分，廿分，半圓），發行量約四億餘元，大部在成都鑄造，以是流用在蓉市附近爲最多，因係法幣輔幣，久已廢棄不用，論噸計斤購買，作爲輕金屬器皿製造之用，若干小型工廠恒多皮藏數噸。廿日新經濟政策公佈，社會卽盛傳中央銀行蓉分行已得通用通知，於是投機鍱幣交易盛行，通宵達且，數萬人聚集街頭，競作買賣，行列長達十餘里，盛况空前。這其間，以中央銀行爲據點，經常造播謠言，掀起幣價波動，投機者流，如瘋如狂，並有若干集團從中操縱。直到廿四日本報（廿一日）航郵寄到，次日有新聞記者持中央總行發行輔幣廣吿，以詢蓉央行經理楊孝慈，楊觀後面容頓然失色，連呼：「糟了，糟了，」當時始通知市府佐告，新舊鎳幣一律通月。而在這幾天的鎳潮，若干人平地致富，若干人蕩產敗家，眞是幾家歡樂幾家愁。　　搶購物資市塲混亂　　由於過去鎳幣流　量的廣大，再加以從改幣令下到公佈鎳幣通用這幾天的距離，投機者儘量在附蓉各縣收購結果，鎳幣開始通用後，鎳潮卽泛濫整個成都市，首先是投機得利者和舊藏豐富者的瘋狂搶購物資，廿五日下午，成千累萬持鎳幣擁塞繁華市區，爭先搶購貨品，三小時以內，蓉市商業中心區春熙路一帶，所有大小百貨公司，商店門市貨物卽被搶購一空，廿六日以後，全市陷入空前混亂狀態，任何大小商成啓門卽遭搶購　凈，後來變成不論貴賤，不計用途，有貨卽搶，見物必購，人心惶惶，莫知所措，少數商家乘機高抬市價，大多數則相率閉門停市。本來成都物價向較京滬爲低，幣制改革，因金銀法幣與金圓比率關係，物價已跳漲數倍。省市當局旣不能當機立斷，制物價於不漲，更未能在鎳幣公開盛行買賣之時，迅謀制止，當機處理，到了鎳潮泛濫，形成變像通貨膨脹，貨品供不應求，物價劇烈彼動，才手忙脚亂，來硬性緊急平抑，雖然市府一再宣稱：要借人頭，平物價，但市塲供需早已失調，物品避懇不出，從廿七日到今天，生活必需品的米，麵，肉，燃料等等，全部絕跡市塲，大小商店僅以極少數零星的高價貨品應市，市民大部無肉可食，懸釜待炊，若得一餐果腹，居然視爲奇運，這是蓉市數十年未有的現象。　　央行經理　難辭其咎　　造成這次蓉市鎳潮，中央銀行蓉分行實負主要責任，該行經理楊孝慈違法舞弊，實難辭其咎以致引起民怨沸騰，輿論交謫，連日向總統及翁院長聯電檢舉該行貪汚的，有留蓉全體立法委員，川康渝國大代表，川省參議會蓉市參議會，全川民衆團體，川廠　察行署及成都特福刑庭，亦提出公開檢舉。據調査央行實汚舞弊的確　經過是：財經緊急處分令自十九日晚公佈蓉央行卽於廿一日得總行謀幣通用電令，該行經理楊孝慈對記者談話，始終閃爍其詞，支吾解釋，但一方面都利用職權，以七千餘億巨額法幣，秘密派心腹赴各地賤價大肆收購，同時該行上起主任，下至公役，以及與該行關係密切的銀行商號大小經濟集團，無不聲其所有，夜以繼日，利用各種方法，在市區及附蓉各縣大量搜購，一面央行復電總行，藉解釋爲名，以拖延時日，到了最後迫不得已而公佈，使一般非法投機者，幾天之內平均獲利二十倍以上，於是鎳幣通用，便興風作浪，搶購物資，所以鍱潮之起，社會一致認爲是央行貪汚舞弊作俑，民情憒慨，咸主澈査。在鎳潮中，多少人多年私備，受人套購，以致　到知己成仇，家庭失和，兇殺自殺，一日鬧案數起，鍱潮！鎳潮！鎳潮帶來了成都市民數十年未有的苦惱。國代有殺人罪嫌　曾憲華妥贛歸案　　〔本報南京十一日訊〕有殺人及貪汚罪鎌之江西國代戡亂委員曾憲聲，十一日由赣保安處派駐省會警局督察徐明新押解歸案，曾係吉安地檢處囑託首都地檢處拘捕者，渠曾請求移轉管轄至首都地檢處偵訊，但爲司法行政部駁回，　　憲華外，上海方面尙有三人與該案有關，將一併迎提回江西偵訊。青侯聖麟暗殺案　發交京地院偵訊　　〔本報南京十一日訊〕由靑島移轉管轉來京偵訊之靑島市參議員趙世偉殺害侯聖麟嫌疑案，司法行政部已將趙案全部巻宗及罪證等物發交首都地檢處偵訊，承辦檢察官以地城過遠，偵査至爲困難，對各疑難問題已具呈司法行政部請示中。武進雪堰　橋刦案破獲　查獲匪開會密室　贓繭二十餘担悉數起出　　〔本報武進十二日電〕本月六日午夜，雪堰橋西淮莊代無錫友聲絲廠收藕之益民蘭行，突被匪徒二十餘人隨帶黃黑狼種警犬二頭，翻屋入內洗刦逾二小時，將全部乾　二十五担餘（價値三百億）分裝小船三艘逸去，嗣失主報縣，懸以失物三分之一巨價重黨緝捕，刑警隊出動，當在該處之天井橋漕家村査獲游民周榮大有重大嫌疑，經跟踪至錫密察，迨渠由錫返常轉道赴丹陽時，加以逮捕，訊得實情，並供係匪首陸道南，張濤主使，十一晨該隊率同員警四十餘名，　輪馳往漕家村王宗祠起　，又至匡家村奸匪匡漢正家抄査，經久始破獲匪陸道南等經常開奮之密室，全部贓物亦悉數起出，並將織疑犯匡志恵，匡秀，屬榮昌一併帶案，當輪　天井時，一度為距攔刦，幸回撃無事，當晚到城，人犯解縣訊辦，貨物通知具領。濟南一婦人　活埋嬰孩　　〔本報濟南十二日電〕濟市經七緯七路南　坑，於十一日午前十一時許，有一婦將出世僅月餘之嬰孩予以活埋，旋爲附近拾煤小孩發現扒出，見孩口內塞破絮，雖甫死去，但體溫尙暖。袖珍新聞　　南通　　〔本報訊〕南通城防前設有守備司令部，頃以第一組部在此間股有指揮所，乃改組爲城防指揮部，由交警十五總隊總隊長溫應冰任指揮官，國防部專員錢其琳，縣長陳賡堯任副指揮官。　　崇明　　〔本報訊〕港口船舶檢査所已在南門，堡鎭，浜鎭三港成立，由吳淞要塞司令部守備大隊長　義爲主任積極展開工作。　　崑山　　〔本報訊〕駐蘇靑年軍獨立營士兵，十日下午來　，拘獲兵販子傅榮根三名，解蘇訊辦。　　常熟　　〔本報訊〕此間民船業同業公會理事長石祖福，主任孫鵬等，被檢舉貪汚舞弊一案，經縣府澈査屬實，已移解地檢處偵辦。錢江潮頭特大　　海塘受損十八處　經搶修潮汛無處　　〔本報杭州十二日電〕今年錢江潮汛，因颶風過境，潮頭特大，沿江海塘受損者十八處，經塘工局日夜搶修，已大部修復，日內卽可全部工竣，八月份潮汛可安渡。戡亂期間都市徵兵改進意見傅  溥正模　　一，査實施徵兵，爲立國必不可少之條件，已爲不可否認之事實。惟抗戰八年，役政基礎悉遭敵人摧殘，舊有道德因亦隨之墮落，戰後雖爲整理機會，又値共匪稱兵作亂，是以保甲之調査與管制不能健全，政令之推行不能澈底，地方富豪勢力彌覺根深蒂個，故實施正規徵集，非但障礙難行，延誤兵員補充，而且頂替逃役之風瀰漫全國，至若准許志願兵入伍，則又一變而爲傭兵制度，兵販充斥，逃亡日甚，素質不佳，匪諜混跡，徒耗人力物資，削减戰鬥實力，爲害之深，不可究極。茲爲應付戡亂需要，防止富豪子弟逃役，加强兵員浴素質，確實推行徼兵制度起見，特本有錢出錢，有力出力之原則，抒供管見，俾所改進。　　乙，實施辦法　　二，調査管制之補救與役政系統之建立：　　査戶口調査不確之原因有二：（一）保甲長各有本業，能力薄弱，不能專門負責；（二）保甲長畏懼權勢，敷衍因循，不敢切實執行。茲特規定：　　（一）每一區（鎭）長兼任役齡男子大滕大隊長，其下分設若干役齡男子小隊，以保爲單位，就年滿二十歲至廿五歲之役齡男子編組之。　　（二）小隊長由保民代表召集保民大會，就同保年齡在廿一至廿五歲之富豪子弟，而又攻讀或家居本市者票選充任之，並以保長爲副隊長，保隊附與甲長爲隊附。　　（三）小隊長負調査，管制指揮之全責，一切有關役政事務，悉由隊長接受區（九）鎭）長之命令辦理，如有包庇敷衍情弊，卽首先提服兵役，並另行票選之。　　（四）保隊附負事務責任，保甲長負協助責任。　　（五）小隊編成之後，應將隊員姓名，年齡，住址，依法公吿，如有錯誤或遺漏，應獎勵檢舉或申請。　　（六）戶長（家長）負有保證本戶（家）隊員永不逃役之責任。各隊員應連環互相保證永不逃役，並於編隊之後，分別出具保證連環交隊長存執。　　三，免緩役範圍之緊縮：　　（一）「中華民國之男子，皆有服兵役之義務」，載在憲怯。至於兵役法第廿四條關於學生緩徵之規定，係爲恐妨礙大多數學生之敎育，但事實上富豪子弟多藉此逃役，此其一；在校學生數量與可能中籤之數量比較，多寡懸殊，不致妨礙整個學生之敎育，此其二；依據本條文施行之結果，所徵士兵，非但不是知識階級，抑且盡係貧苦人民，使社會造成以窮人保護富人之事實，影響軍心極巨，此其三；兵役法第廿四條後段，「學生於畢業後徵集入營，完成預備幹部敎育」一節，現在迄未實施，因學生未服兵卒役，不僅影響士兵知識水準甚大，抑且使人至生富人絕不當兵之議，此其四，因此兵役法第廿四條第二款應暫緩實施。　　（二）國家官吏，軍文軍屬，商店僱員，工廠礦塲普通員工，兵役怯原無免緩徵召之規定，惟因現役徵集年次，規定爲廿一歲，而身家調査，亦僅及於保甲，致使上述人員均少服役機會，茲應將現役年齦延伸需廿一至廿五歲之五個年次，徵集統憑籤號，不論年次，並將寄身於機關，學校，廠塲，而在當地別無戶籍之五個年次役　男子，按保役齡男子小隊之例，各就原單位編爲若干小隊，仍受區（鎭）長之指揮。　　（三）兵役法第廿六條第一款，「現任有關國肪工業之專門技術員工，經審査核定者」，曁其「適用範圍」，准予緩徵之規定過於廣泛，往往予人民以逃役之機會，此其一；證諸以往經驗，無論需兵如何衆多，每次配賦兵額，每保不過數名，今以工廠爲例，每廠技術員工至少數十人，甚且竟有數百名及達千名者，其中徵集二三名充當新兵，對於國防工業，絕無損害，此其二；因此應將兵役法第廿六條第一款暫緩實施。　　四·體格檢査與抽籤：　　（一）仍採間接抽籤辦法。　　（二）由市府或兵役協會代表抽籤或由各保小隊長互選一人抽簽均可，其餘各隊長蒞塲監視。　　（三）體格檢査在入徵集所時舉行，確有因病不堪服役者，由次號中籤役齡男子遞補。　　五·停止志願兵之徵集與遠徵罰金之規定：　　（一）絕對停止徵集志願兵，其有確屬志願從軍者，准逕向各部瞰投效，服役，但除其家屬可以依怯享受優待外，不得發給安家費，不得抵作徵額。　　（二）富豪子弟中　後，因事故不能入營者，得按上士兩年之待遇，（包括薪餉，服裝，主副食），加十倍繳納違徵罰金金圓一千元，一彙繳國防部移作搶徵匪區壯丁之用，並科罰其担任本區（鎭）十人之安家費金圓二千元，無故逃役者，得按上述罰款加一倍至兩倍繳納。　　六·安家費之發放與籌措：　　（一）安家費按直系親屬多寡，分爲兩種補助之。　　（二）家屬不超過三人者，按三人計算（每人以食米三石六斗計），至給中熟米十石男八斗，並得按限（市）價一次發放之（現以每石金圓廿元計算，合二百一十六元）　　（三）家屬在四人以上者，按五人計算（每人以三石六斗計），發給中熟米十入石，並得按限（市）價一次發給之（現以每石金圓廿元計算，合三百六十元）。　　（四）有家屬者，發給家屬，無家屬者，先發二分之一，其餘存入國家銀行，但其存摺得交新兵本人自行保存，非有特別事故，經該管最高長官證明，或非在退五後，不得支取。　　（五）安家費來源，由兵役協會按照需要數量，召集有關各機關會商籌集，由娛樂，筵席，房捐，營業，地產等各種附加稅捐由徵收機關代徵之，交兵役協會負責保管配發之。　　七·優待家屬：　　新兵家屬之優待，由兵役管區協同市府依照法令切實加强實施之。　　八，退伍轉役：　　（一）無論任何戰况之下，如果上述辦怯行之有效，得按兩年現役之規定，予以期滿退伍，轉入預備役。　　（二）新兵退伍後，除願回任原職原業者外，其餘得由政府負實安插或實施授田。　　九，都市役政主管人事之調整：　　爲使特別市之役政推行便利起見，都市團區司令職務，應由民政局長兼任（省轄市團區司令由市長兼任之），加派專任副司令一員輔助之，並取消軍事科，一切兵役行政，由團區直接指揮各區（鎭），團區仍受當地師管區司令節制指揮。</p>

<p>一般物價　管制嚴厲物資本籠　游資南流為數警人　　上週爲幣制改革後的第三週，當局感於前兩週的市塲，交易清稀，有行無市，但在暗地裏，物資却有向外逃避，造成物價蠢蠢欲漲的趨勢。爲了確保新經濟方案的成功，於是不得不採取最嚴厲的手段，來對付這些見利忘法的投機之徒。　　計陸續經逮捕的鉅商，約有申新紗廠總經理榮鴻元，紙業公會理事長詹沛霖，永泰和烟公司總經理黃以聰，棉布囤積商許文彬等。　　同時在檢査倉庫之外，復制訂「上海區禁止物資携運出境檢査辦法」，規定：（甲）食品：穀米·小麥·麵粉·食糖。食油·菜油·荳油·花生油·麻油及其原料。（乙）服用品：棉花·棉布·棉紗·及本色·漂白·印花等各種棉布。（丙）燃料：煤塊·煤末·煤球·煤炭及木炭。（丁）日用品：烟·紙·皂·鹼·皮革·人造絲·橡膠等　物資，非經由上海區物資調節委員會特許，或旅客隨時携帶者外，一律禁止運輸出境。　　在這種雷厲風行的壓力下，於是申新紗廠遵照每週配紗八百件，永安紗廠亦開始售出，市塲棉布供應亦增多，物資倒有點紛紛出籠的現象。　　上週市塲游資，前三日均有差進，後三日轉鬆，毎日差出在百萬元以上。暗息站一角上下。據稱游資大量南流，汹湧驚人。報載：「滬游資又開始汹湧南流，據穗行統計，五六兩日自滬匯穗款卽逹一六〇萬金圓。自八一九以來，滬物資·黃金·外幣·財富大量逃港，數目之大，無法估計。本港金融市塲因黃金外幣來源擁擠，連日波動甚大，金價美鈔均跌。一　　市場交易逐步做開　　商品市塲的走勢，由於當局澈底管制的結果，在限價內交易漸有做開。　紗布方面，棉紗仍以雜脾貨成交爲多，藍鳳紗仍無市，雙馬紗則間有成交，廿一支雙馬價站七八三元。棉布在當局禁止外移，與淸査囤貨之揹施下，市上頗有供應，計龍頭布由週初之廿九元四角，步降至週五之廿八元。　　人造絲由於中信局之配額增加，執戶紛紛拋售，在　價內各檔均有成交。　　糧食因產價平波，本市求供相埒，不甚興旺，價甚平穩。週末北市塲上白粳價站廿元八角，南南塲價廿元五角。食油禁止外移，市勢平穩，靑島吉桶生油週末十四元。麵粉因產地麥價轉小，價略下瀉，週末兵船粉價爲七元一角六分。　　日用品方面因答銷見暢，交易活躍，捲烟在限價內做開，但高檔貨仍在限價外徘徊，肥皂一致下降，火柴仍甚俏利。　　維持限價恢復貼補　　當局同爲澈底維特限價起見，經行政院經管會決議：（一）燃煤燃油及配售米糧價格，均維持八月十九日之標準。（小汽車所用汽油除外）。（二）公用交通事業價格，一律維持八月十九日之定價。（三）關於貼補交通部所屬鐵路郵政電信等機構事業費一案，復由政務會議決定，一次撥給總額一千五百萬金圓，並爲維持各該項事業保持八一九限價，將來或可斟酌情形，繼續按時貼補。　　專設機構　推行節約　　幣制改革後，當局對於節約消費，推行不遺餘力，八日行政院政務會議通過設置節約指導委員會，派谷正綱祖任主任委員。政院復擬定「節約汽油减少車輛辦法」，將提出政務會議討論。　據悉該辦法爲：（一）地域爲京滬津靑四市，以後再推廣至其他地區。　　（二）車輛限制分二期，第一期九月十八日起至九月廿八日止，按八月十九日車輛减少百分之十五。第二期十月二十八日止，再按八月十九日减少百分之十。　　（三）油量限制分二期，第一期按八月十九日前一個月實際用油量，减少百分之十五，第二期按八月十九日原量减少百分之十五。　　（四）自九月十八日起（或十月一日起），開微汽油消費稅，但政府機關公用交通事業及必需生產事菜用油免徽。　　（五）自十月一日起，提高牌照稅撥充修路之用。　　（六）詳細辦法由各地市府自擬。　在物資供應匱乏的狀况下，節約可以减少需求，對於物價的穩定，至少是有點消極作用的。　　國營事業正式出售　　開於出售國營事業一案，已於上週起付諸實施。其中較大單位之紡建公司，已於九月十一日起，改稱爲中國紡織建設股份有限公司，新公司目前資產，卽爲前中國紡織建設公司，除東北分公司外之全部資產，估計爲十一億四千萬元。爲便利發行股票起見，新公司資本總額定爲八億元，分八百萬股，毎股票面金圓一百元，分五股，十股，一百股，一千股等四種，內二百四十萬股，定於本月十一日起公開出售，四百二十萬股，移充金圓劵發行凖備，尙有一百四十萬股，仍由政府暫予保留。出售股票，如達到資本總額十分之一時，卽召開股東大會，商股部份，推選董監事。　　至於招商局亦進行改組爲招商局輪船股份有限公司，發行股票，全部資產金圓六億元，除三億元移充金圓劵發行凖備外，餘半數三億元出售，並硬性規定購買股票者必須爲中華民國國藉之國民。此外出售之國營事業股票，爲台糖公司四千八百萬元，台紙公司一千二百萬元，天津紙業公司四百萬元。速中紡公司，招商局共計出售股票總額金圓五億六千四百萬元。九月十日起開始發售，第一日售出各項股票共達金圓一百二十四萬二千元，計（一）中紡售出七九四，〇〇〇元。（二）合糖售出三六八，五〇〇元。（三）台紙售出六五，〇〇〇元。（四）招商局售出一四，五〇〇元。　　上週批發價指數按用途分類者如次。　　上週批發物價指數總指數較八月份第三週漲百分之一·二三　　上週批發物價指數按加工程度分類者如次：　　上週批發物價指數（按產銷國別分類者如次）貨幣·金融　　（一）銀根暗息　　上週乃改革幣制以後的第三週，雖然本市銀根已經漸漸自鬆濫走向平穩，但游資的苦無正當出路，依然如故。　　在上半週，本市資金外流，呈如火如茶之勢，按五十元與百元票面金圓券於上週問世後，卽遭受航帮的靑睞，行莊南匯的款項，再加上航帮所搜掉的鉅額金元券的南流，據說每天有達百萬元以上者，除此而外，上週流往蓉·渝·昆等地的游資，亦復不少，這固然是以上各地，經濟管制較鬆的反映，但一說與各該地鎳幣之市塲價格低於法定價格，亦不無關係。游資外流，對本市游資　積的壓力，固發生了一部份减輕的作用，此外，如行局的拋售物資，金銀外幣兌換的日見减少，均是促成上半週銀根平靜的有力因素。　　收購物資　頭寸旺盛　　但是，游資這樣的出路，並不正常，因之到了上週的下半週，銀根又漸漸自平穩轉向鬆弛了。喧傳甚久的，出售國營事業以容納游資一節，上週週五已由中央銀行，委託中國交通農民台灣四銀行開始辦理，而且據說第一天承購者卽甚踴躍，計各銀行售出各單位之股票，達一百廿四萬又二千金元，但如以此數與估計中的本市目前游資總額一億金元相較，距離仍太遙遠。同時，市間盛傳中紡公司官股與商股之比例，將改爲百分之七十與百分之三十之比，（前曾傳中紡百分之七十股票將出售），對目前與將來的民心，自亦不無影響。出售國營事業一事，對上週銀根，固尙無抽緊的作用可言，而週三以後，南流的游資，以無出路，又有回流本市之趨勢，於是行莊的存款亦吿增加了，這確是一個警吿。同時，當局繼拋售物資之後，又來幾次物資的收購，國家行局乃再見連讀巨出，市面上頭寸供源旺盛，銀根自然轉見鬆弛了。　　資金回流　匯水普降　　　（二）內外匯率　　上週本市內匯匯率，華南區穗廈匯水，週初均各創七十元與八十元之新價，當與本市資金大量南流一事有關。週三（九日）以後，據悉流穗資金有流回本市之趨勢，同時，商業行莊方面又接獲央行的通函，規定內匯最高收費額不得超過千分之二十，否則取消同業調撥頭寸的權利，於是行莊匯水，週三後普見抑低。穗匯匯水，，目週三至週五，穩定於三十元。廈門匯水，週三亦已降至三十元，週五再低見廿五元。　　渝匯匯水最稱穩定，週一至週五，均爲二十元，漢匯週二以前爲三十元，週三起改爲廿五元，津匯匯水亦續見下落週一爲二十元，週三爲肝元，週五已縮至十　　　　外匯行市，金價銀樓業飾金掛牌照舊，惟限於毎人日購一錢，交易不盛，香港申匯無市，港金毎華兩週一爲二百九十四元，至週四已升至二百九十六元。香港美鈔價格週一爲五元一角三分，週二落爲五元〇八分，週四則復升至五元一角五分。　　上週暗息，大致站一角左右，最高亦未超過一角五分，貨帮貼息，日拆在三元至五元間，合月息約九分至一角半。行莊頭寸，前半週帶斂，單子多缺互見，缺單大致以現款抵補，後半週頭寸轉弛，多單普遍，週五間接交換，且有相當差進，其鬆勢可見。同業拆放，少有做開，自週一至週五，六十號以後行莊交換結果，計共差出五百八十萬元，其間尙包括台灣銀行差進五十二萬三千元，故商業行莊間接交換之實際差出，五天內當爲六百卅二萬三千元，較前週同期內增出二百九十萬九千九百元。　　行局減進　銀根再鬆　　國家行局庫交換結果週三以前，因收進拋售物資等款項，迭有差進，週四起，收購物資，反進爲出，自週一至週五，計共差進一百〇一萬八千〇七十元，較前週同期內减進達二百五十四萬四千九百三十元。　　洋商銀行，週二監進達七十餘萬之鉅，據悉與游資南流有關，但嗣後續見差出，惟出數不大，自週一至週五，洋商銀行共尙差進五十七萬八千九百一十四元，較前週同期內减進違三百〇一萬〇三十八元。僑資輸入及外匯存款　支付辦法近訊　　在幣制改革前當局爲促進僑資及國人在外資金投資國內生產事業起見，由輸出入管理委員會呈准行政院於八月二日公布「僑資及國人在外資金投資國內生產事業申請輸入辦法」，該辦法要點爲：（一）僑資及國人在外資金，移回國內創辦新生產事業或擴充現有生產事業，須具條件：（甲）其事業確爲國內所需要或能增加輸出者。（乙）所辦事業需用之主要原料半數以上能取給於國內者。（二）至轍入物品以下列爲限：（甲）必須進口之生產器材，確爲申請人自用者。（乙）前款器材必需之附件，或裝置前款器材必需之物料。（丙）所辦事業需用之設備，國內缺乏，確須向國外購置者。（丁）所辦事業必需進口之原料，確爲申請人自用，不超過生產所需六個月之用量者。（三）僑資創辦或擴充事業，爲籌措必需之國幣資金，經事業主管機關核准，得向輸出入管理委員會申請輸入政府指定範圍以內之物資。該項物資暫規定爲米，麥，麵粉，棉花，羊毛，蔴及蔴袋，蔴草，生橡膠及汽車胎，木材及枕木，肥料，汽油，榮油，滑物油，煤，焦炭，紙及紙漿，椰子油，特效藥字肥料。　　在上項辦法公布後，輸管會又奉准制訂「僑資及國人在外資金投資國內生產事業申請輸入辦法實施細則」，於八月二十四日公布，準備施行。旋因財政經濟緊急處令頒布，其中人民所有金銀外幣處理辦法第四條第二款規定存儲於中央銀行如爲外國幣劵，谷以其原幣存儲。如爲黃金，白銀，銀幣，得依照前條各項兌換率折合美金存儲。前項存備之款，得憑輸入許可證支付輸入物品之貨價，或支付經財政部核准之其他用途。　　「人民所有金銀外幣處理辦法」頒布後，因與輸管會原制訂之辦法頗多抵觸之處。茲聞輸管會已將該項辦法改爲「　資投資國內生產事業申請輸入辦法」，內容亦略有修正，至國人在外資金回國，則按央行外幣外匯存款支付辦法辦理，其僑資實施細則，輸管會亦正修訂中，不日將呈行政院核示公佈施行。　　輸管會爲修訂僑資輸入辦法及外幣外匯又付辦法，近與央行會議商決：（一）外幣外匯支付毎期支付不得超過原存款額四分之一。（二）申請輸入附表一，毎期得支用其原存款額二分之一。（三）修訂輸入貨品類等，該會將再斷續研究，與央行配合施行。輸管會發表　重要出口貨限價　有完桐油皮毛茶葉等十種　　　輸管會劉出口外銷貨品，實行最低出口價格，頃發表猪鬃桐油等重要出口貨，詳細限價如下：　　（一）猪鬃　　（黑）上海17號配鬃百分之五十成色，毎磅（淨FOB價格，佣金在外，下同，二·四五美元。上海17號配鬃百分之七十成色，毎磅三·一五美元。重慶27號配鬃每磅二·六五美元。漢口17號配鬢，毎磅四·二五美元。天津55號長配鬃，毎磅九·四〇美元。天津55號短配鬃，毎磅六·三〇美元。　　（二）桐油　　散裝（標準品質），毎磅○。一八美元，桶裝（標準品質），毎磅〇·一九美元。　　（三）皮貨　　黑猾褥子（西路），每張五·〇〇美元，黑猾褥子（濟寗），毎張二·〇〇美元，靑猾褥子，毎張三·〇〇美元，白猾褥子毎張二·二〇美元，羊腿褥子（西路），毎張一·二五美元，羊腿褥子（南路），毎張一·七五美元，羊頭褥子，毎張一·二五美元，羊耳褥子，毎張一·二五美元，湖羊褥子毎張二·五〇美元。　　（四）毛皮　　野兎毎張〇·〇九美元，育猖皮毎張一·〇〇美元，小羔皮（甘肅），毎張一·二〇美元。小湖羊皮出胎（浙江），毎張一·六〇美元。小湖羊皮肚剝（浙江），毎張二·〇〇美元。羔羊皮（濟寗），毎張二·三〇美元。四川兎皮（毎百張

<p>自由談便宜了東條英機  劉泰　　〔譯者註：遠東國際軍事法庭開審迄今，參加渦採訪工作的各國新聞記者頗不乏人，但自始至終旁聽不懈的，却祇有美國記者弗蘭克·懷持Frank　L　White人。據他最近在紐約先鋒論壇報每週增刋發表的一篇通訊，日本戰犯的審判簡直已經失敗！我國受日本的害最烈，對比不能不加關切，因亟節譯於此，　　東京的遠東國際軍事法庭也許已在國際法上開創了許多新例，但是，以對日本人民所產生的效果而論，却實在和開審之初已經大相逕庭。　　譬如說，東條英機在這次導致日本大敗之後，日本的人民本來都預料他一定會切腹自殺，但是他竟不用匕首而用手槍，又因爲沒有瞄準，以致僅受微傷——在那個時候，他是一個被全日本所笑罵的懦夫，但是，受審以後，他和國際法庭的檢察長幾度舌劍唇槍，已經掙回了面子。他在被吿席上痛罵美國發動太平洋戰爭，而且竟再度號召遠東各民族團結一致，反抗西方國家，大言炎炎，旁若無人。日本各報都以最大的篇幅競相刋載，儼然成爲被盟軍佔領後一件最大的新聞。日本人民對他的印象顯然已經大爲轉變，無論將來法庭會判東條什麽罪刑，他在日本人民心目中的地位是已經根深蒂固，決無動搖之可能了。　　十一個盟國聯合組織的檢察團，已經遭逢了顯著的失敗，爲甚麽竟會失敗的呢？各盟國間不無妬嫉之心是其一，法官方面的無能是其二，被吿方面之狡黠善辯是其三。　　這次審判之不能順利奏功，也許還應該從頭說起。一九四五年十二月，美國若干法學家匆匆集合華府，搭乘了兩架銀光燦爛的革用機飛往日本。據他們的預料，這次去日本審判戰犯，至多半年便可竣事，因爲有人吿訴他們說一切證據都已收集齊備了，專等他們去後正式向庭上提出，一切便可解決。　　但是，他們到了東京一看，却是一點證據也沒有。鹵獲的日本官方文件堆積如山，但大多數沒有翻譯。後來譯了一部份，看看全是毫無價値的東西。事實上，自從日皇昭和在一九四五年八月十四日宣布投降，到美軍在同年八月廿七日開始登陸，其中相隔有十幾天之多，所有的機密文件已經在這一時期內差不多全部燒光！　　檢察長季楠的工作當然大不容易。最初滿心以爲六個月可以了結的審訊工作，到今年四月十七日暫吿段落——已經審了差不多整整兩年。供詞和辯論的文字達一千一百五十萬字，足可寫成一百多部小說。費用之浩大更是不可勝計，有人說，單以美國所應當負担的一部份而論，就已達七百五十萬美元。總數無從知道，因爲這是麥帥總部列入「機密」項下的，但一般估計在二千萬美元以上。　　開始審訊時，新聞檢査是很嚴格的，後來，也許因爲這件事情的新聞性已漸漸减少，檢査的尺度逐步放寬，等到主要戰犯答辯的時候，檢査差不多已經停止。麥帥總部對日本報紙的處理新聞根本沒有一個熟練的官員加以管理，結果是盟國失去了一個宣傳的絕好機會。東條受審時，各報紛紛大事揭載的，差不多全是東條的一面之辭！　　此外，至今還有一部份在日本政肘內供職的官僚，暗中在協助東條等各被吿。法庭方面到日本政府機關去調閱卷宗時，明明有的，他們也說沒有；等被吿調卷時，却就有求必應了。最近査明：日政府官員中有許多曾任高　　軍官的，竟然都是被吿方面的「　問」！　　而且，季楠和其他盟國的同僚間的感情也不大好。他曾請假回美七個月，那時他的同僚就紛紛請求麥帥撤換季楠。麥帥未准。季楠回任後就撤換了不少檢察方面的重要人員。這些被撤換的人們也非平庸之輩，等東條開審，季楠親自盤詰時，他們竟高踞棋座，高聲說：「今天看東條絞死李楠！」　　現在，大家對遠東國際軍事法庭的審判情形已經漠不關心，誰也不知道究竟要到什麼麼時候才審得完。不過，有一個人却在這一片混亂中恢復了聲譽，儼然成爲雖敗猶榮的「英雄」——這個人便是東條英機。婚姻趣話  起鳳　　近來婚姻中的許多禮儀習慣，大多為古代的迷信及宗敎儀式的遺留物；雖然已經過了幾千年歲月的流逝，它們還被沿用着，摹仿着，而且各地都有它特有的表現　　在歐美，卽使是現在，一般的人士，尤其是鄉村中的，還喜歡在五月裏行婚禮；因爲根據相傳下來的習慣，只有在五月下種的時期才能慶祝婚禮，以象徵其多產富饒之意。　　現在新婚的夫婦們很着重於蜜月的是否能渡得甜蜜和愉快，其實這實在是古代掠奪婚姻下的一個遺俗，不過其意義不同而已。古代的丈夫爲了要幽禁及保護他那位搶來的夫人，便和她選一個陌生的地方隱居起來，以避免她親友的騷擾或爭奪。　　設到親友在結婚時所送的賀禮，眞是別出心裁。在地中海有一個呌撒彼羅斯的島，每當有婚事的時候，他們把許多墊子放在公共的地方，讓親友們把賀儀塞在裏面。不過，那些錢務必要等婚後一年才能動用。在希臘，結婚喜宴用的麵包是在賀客面前揑成的，賀客們便把賀禮（金錢）拋在麵粉中。　　在南美的西南部，有一種赫羅族的土人，他們的婚姻制度更是聞所未聞：新郞不單娶他的新娘，並且，如新娘的姊姊尙未出嫁，也得一同娶去！　　做柯克島上的新娘倒不是一件容易的事，因爲在結婚的那天，島上許多的靑年的男子要將身子躺在地上，面朝地，連接在一起，做成一條「肉地毯」，從新娘的家中一直通到新郎的家。然後讓新娘在這條特製的地毯上（他們的背上）一步一步地走到新郞的身畔！　　最簡單的婚禮是在南太平洋的尼格麗吐族中。新郞和新娘只要雙雙走到族中的長老那兒，讓長老把他倆的頭互相碰一下，就算結爲夫婦了。美國點滴  蒼雨　　美國報紙的浪費，眞令人驚奇。有些報紙星期天連各種增刋特刋，每份竟有厚厚的四十大張。世界上所有的新聞用紙消費量，美國就佔百分之六十一。美國有九百多家公司是由一萬數千個從十六歲至二十一歲的男女孩子們所經營的，單是紐約就有六十餘家。從僕人到經理都由孩子們担任；他們所販賣的貨品大槪是鳥籠，花盆，手杖，裁紙刀，玩具，木碗，以及日常零星用具。　　在美國的大西洋城中，有一座世界上最大的寒暑表，其高度達五十呎，它的構造宛如電梯的昇降指示表，每昇或降一度，就有很亮的光顯出，遠在三里路之外，便可淸晰地見到。關於「賣書」  何苦　　我以　書不成，寫了一篇經過與感想，發表在本談。昨天由編者轉下三位讀者的來信，都想要買這十二冊老爺雜誌，讀者的盛情可感，不得不使我鼓一點勇氣來作一答覆。　　A君寫信來說歡喜看雜誌，但不知「老爺」雜誌之原名爲何。這是筆者沒有把英文原名Esquire註了出來之故。這是一本「男人的雜誌」，但上海的小姐們也歡喜着，因爲裏面有最流行的領帶·皮鞋·襯衫等式樣，可以作爲衡量她的「朋友」服飾之是否合乎標準也　　B君來信，也是想買下這十二冊雜誌，他說：「足下的舊書，正是鄙人的新書」。B君的來信，使我覺得一新」與「舊」的比較，便應作如是看法。所謂「日光之下，無新事物」，在奢華的環境裏常容易令人有「喜新厭舊」的習慣，其實正可體味B君的來信而「泯此一念」也。　　C君的來信寫明價格，願出五角一本的代價，全部收買我十二册雜誌　　不過我對以上三君覺得非常抱歉，當我草此「賣書」小文時，已經不預備把這十二册雜誌出售了。這在前文的結末有「溫故而知新」的意思可以看出來。我覺得編者的誠意極可尊重，當他轉下三君來信的時候，還附下一箋，殿以「然弟還是覺得賣之可惜耳」。說實話，我是很有「故劍之思」的，而况這是內容甚爲豐富的老爺雜誌。　　對於讀者惠書，祗得由衷的感謝，無法答覆你們的盛意，這是我深深地感到歉疚的。蓋章  尢墨君　　簽了字，還要蓋章，閙成疊狀架屋笑柄，這本談已有老丹先生在「簽字蓋章」一文中說得很透徹了。像我不過一窮敎員，每學期應聘書上，亦非簽字蓋章不可。每月薪金收據上亦然，據說倘僅簽名而不蓋章，校方恐要受督學先生的査詢，有所未便，故自然只好遵行了　　簽字不能假冒，圖章可以作僞，，這道理本極淺顯。人心不古，自昔已然。像米元章書史云：「王詵刻勾「德元圖書記」，亂印書畫！余辨出元氏脚，遂伏其偽。」這可證圖章可以作偽。像「德元圖書記」僞章，在元章法眼未經辨出之前，受其欺者恐不知有多少附庸風雅之士了。　　今稱私印曰圖章，宋元時概稱「圖書」。論名稱，今勝於昔，因如「某氏圖書」或「某人圖書之記」，僅不過鈐用於岡畫書籍之上，以資識別，其功用不過如此，故不能並私印而概稱圖書。然圖書旣可作偽，那末私章又怎能保得住無人偽造？故蓋章之不十分靠得住，非但於今爲烈，證以米元章書史所云，可說自昔已然了。　　印人彙集其自己所治之印或嗜印者蒐羅古今人所治之印，各成卷帙，今稱印譜，古稱「圖書譜」。蘇門四君子之一張耒柯山集中有湯克一圖書序云：「圖書之名，予不知其所起，蓋古所謂　，用以爲信者。克一旣好之，其父補之愛之尤篤，能悉取古今印法，盡錄其變，謂之岡書譜」云云。此印譜序之始見於古人文集中者。味張耒文意，似此種　印成帙，創於湯克一，那末湯克一可稱是集印成譜者之先河了。風雨中看白荷花  賀天健　　戊子八月初三日小箕山頭　　此境何曾一日忘？荷花荷葉滿池塘。十年夢斷西灣月（其地名西灣），失笑斷來秋　霜。三兩朵留如有待，絕無　染却非常。素娥偏約龍宮女，風雨迎吾綠玉牀。　　西行山壓黑雲低，萬樹乘楊大小堤。難得殘荷　雨打，何當這世結茅栖。花飛白點星稀夜，水攪狂波　擊　。畫筆　哥驚擲手，若敎見我得無詆？（黃大痴方臨　畫，聞太湖中有笳　聲，即中擊。）記呂美蓀女士  陳詒先　　本欄有陸丹林君的「記呂碧城女士」一文，余未見碧城，而曾晤其姊美蓀，碧城行三，美蓀行二，其上有一姊，忘其名，姊妹三人而無兄弟。　　當民十六至十九數年，余兄蒼虬在滬　　，先居極司非而路康家橋，後遷康腦脫路長康里，某年余自杭來滬，下榻兄處，一日，忽有以呂美蓀名片來拜訪者，蒼虬兄亦不識其人，及延入，乃一女士也，年約四十歲光景。寒暄後，始憶前曾以其詩數首寄閱者，余兄言其詩筆力頗健，無　閣氣，女子中有此才，尙所未見。以後又來數次，頗談及其家世。據言：「家爲旌德大族，其後衰落，由於遷墳一事。其父爲翰林，曾放學差。晚年在鄉購得一佳城，擬遷其祖墳，在定期下葬之前一夕，夢至一城隍廟，城隍延入坐，不久有一紅面偉丈夫者乘馬至，隨從甚盛，城隍迎接極恭，坐定，紅面者向其父言：『你所購地，我已居多年，願勿遷動。』其父醒後，以夢不足信，且卽有其事，可見其地位之佳，更不願犧牲，乃掘土二尺餘，果見下有一棺，當日雖得遷葬畢事，及夕而工人暴死一人，其父以驚慯之餘，不久亦歿。彼姊妹三人均幼，家無男丁，財產爲族人朋分竊佔以去，家遂中落。」以上話雖近於迷信，而出之於美蓀女士親口所告，亦可異也。　　美蓀女士又言：「其大姊在民前任南京女子師範學堂監督，有一生甚美，別校一男生追求之，竟以情書寄來，此生以原信呈監督，以事論理固非，然其情不無可原，乃其大姊爲永絕糾紛起見，命女生覆函約男生來校，已則坐轎往見總督張人駿，禀吿其事，以情書爲證，人駿傳上元縣立卽派差人到女子師範學校執此男生監之，不及一年，此生竟鬱死禁中，其大姊不久得神經病，終於不治。」此又一奇事也。　　美蓀女士喜作詩，旣以其詩送蒼虬兄閱看，又極佩服散原先生。散原先生某年患病，美蓀曾言願以看護之名義，照料散原先生之健康，散原感其意而婉謝之，蓋美蓀頭腦較新，本於敬老尊賢，並無他意，而散原先生則思想不能與之同也。　　近晤蔡子玉兄，言美蓀女士現居靑島，仍健在，並世必有知其人者，且三姊妹皆多才，故一記之。三十七年第二次郵政民意測騐　三二眶年第二次　（三十七年九月十三日）　　請把你認爲最適合的一項用　摘出來。　　（一）就你的經騐你覺得那一種信頂快？平信，口平快，口快信，口航平，口航平快，口航快。　　（二）就你的經騐，你覺得那一種信頂安全？平信，口　號信，口報値掛號，口保價信。　　（三）你覺得現在鄉村郵務比從前怎樣？進步，口略有進步，口沒有進步，口不如從前。　　（四）你對郵局和郵匯局的感覺怎樣？　　　，郵局：口滿意，口不滿意，口無意見。　　乙，郵匯局：口滿意，口不滿意，口無意見。　　（五）照現行郵政規則，除保價信函外，信內不能裝鈔票。就你個人的需要你認爲——　　甲，口爲了郵件安全最好除保價信函外，一律不要裝鈔票；　　乙，口一切信函內應當可以裝鈔票；　　丙，口報値掛號信函內，應當可以裝鈔票。　　（六）集郵有許多利益，請就你認爲對的答案上打一　。　　甲，口增加歷史和地理智識，乙，口養成有秩序的習慣，丙，口培養　美觀念，丁，口增加印刷鐫刻的常識，戊，口是最穩妥的投資與儲蓄，已，口是一種高尙娛樂，庚，口陶冶

<h3>National Army in Northern Jiangsu Advances on Lianshui; Over 4,000 Bandits Wounded or Killed in Shuyang Campaign; Continues to Reclaim Fanli East of Lushi in Western Henan</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Xuzhou, 12th] The National Army in Northern Jiangsu achieved a glorious victory in recovering Shuyang, killing and wounding a total of 4,270 bandits from the 2nd and 12th Columns, capturing over 200, and seizing 11 light machine guns, 2 heavy machine guns, 82 grenade launchers, 2 mortars, and 105 rifles. The Air Force also bombed and sank over 100 bandit boats. After this blow, most of the seriously wounded bandits were executed, with only the lightly wounded soldiers being transported back, a truly miserable situation.</p>
<p>[Military News Agency, Xuzhou, 12th] After the National Army recovered Shuyang, in order to thoroughly annihilate the bandit forces in Northern Jiangsu, they launched a full-scale campaign. The encirclement and suppression troops advancing north from Shuyang have already exceeded Sangdongbei by 12 kilometers and are advancing towards Fangshan Street. Another elite force is advancing from A-Hu Chengtou towards Fangshan Street. The National Army advancing from Huaiyin in two directions has already approached the suburbs of Lianshui. Another force is conducting search and suppression operations near Shuyang. Each elite force is intensifying its mopping-up operations, and the bandit suppression troops advancing south from Shuyang are coordinating with the troops advancing north from Huaiyin to jointly attack the bandits fleeing south.</p>
<p>[Military News Agency, Xuzhou, 12th] The National Army in Sixian, Northern Anhui, pursuing east, has recovered Qingyang Town and is continuing to pursue northeast.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Qingdao, 12th] Military News: Our Navy and Air Force jointly bombed the bandit maritime supply port of Lidao Bay (south of Rongcheng Bay, Shandong Peninsula) for the first time on the morning of the 10th, destroying many bandit strongholds and over ten transport steamers, inflicting a major blow on the bandits and setting a new record for joint sea and air suppression of the rebellion.</p>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Xi'an, 12th] The National Army in Western Henan continues its eastward sweep from Lushi and has now recovered Fanli. The bandit troops under Li Jingyi have collapsed and fled east. A small group of about 200 bandits who attacked Shaanxi Prefecture have infiltrated into Caiyuan, southeast of Shaanxi Prefecture, and local defense forces are intercepting them. It is reported that the bandits recently held a military conference in Guanyintang, planning to use four brigades to attack Western Henan again, eliminate the local defense forces, and invade Tongguan, coordinating with the bandits moving south from Hancheng and Heyang to threaten Guanzhong. It is reported that the bandits along the Jing River in western Guanzhong have not given up their ambition and have recently attempted to establish several underground transportation lines, namely controlling the narrow mountain paths and infiltrating the National Army's defense areas. Local garrison troops have already uncovered many cases and are maintaining strict vigilance to prevent bandit infiltration. Also, the Communist bandits' First Column in Shaanxi has moved from the Huanglong Mountain area to the Chengcheng area and engaged in fierce fighting with the local defense forces. A force of about 400 has been surrounded near Wangzhuang and is currently being annihilated.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Hankou, 12th] The bandit den near Bailu Lake in the Jianghan District has been completely destroyed by the National Army, and many important bandit warehouses have been seized. The amount of cloth for military uniforms, even those not yet made, reached over 20,000 sets.</p>
<h3>Notorious Bandit Duan Ying Captured After Sneaking into Kunming; Apprehended in a Nunnery with His Mistress</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Kunming, 12th] Duan Ying, a notorious bandit in Western Yunnan, known as "Little Fire Dragon," gathered bandits to organize the Democratic Allied Army, claiming to be the "Commander of the Western Yunnan Column." Recently, it was learned that Duan Ying had sneaked into Kunming. After careful deployment by the police and security department, Duan Ying and his mistress, Tian Julan, were finally captured at the Mingni Nunnery in the western suburbs. Duan has confessed without reservation, claiming to have joined the Communist Party in 1928 and the Democratic League in 1947. He currently has over 2,000 bandits under his command, with over 600 rifles and 3 local cannons. This time, he disguised himself and sneaked into Kunming, intending to contact accomplices in Kunming and secretly plot an uprising. Unexpectedly, he was arrested. The interrogation is still ongoing, aiming to reveal the remaining accomplices and sweep away the bandit atmosphere in Western Yunnan in one fell swoop.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Kunming, 10th] The City Police Bureau recently announced the details of Duan Ying's capture, stating that after Police Chief Wang of the City Police Bureau received a report at the beginning of the month that bandit Duan had sneaked into Kunming, he immediately made careful deployments for reconnaissance. Li Zhizheng, the chief of the 2nd Branch of the Bureau, obtained reliable information confirming that bandit Duan was indeed in Kunming. Thus, on the morning of the 4th, Duan Ying and his mistress Tian Julan, a female student from Yao'an High School, were captured in the Mingjia Di Nunnery in the city. When the police officers took action, Duan and Tian were still sound asleep. After being arrested, Duan only confessed that this time he came to Kunming, disguised as a pig butcher on a small path, changed his name to Li Ming, so he was not noticed. The purpose was to contact accomplices and plan a comeback. He joined the Communist Party as early as 1928, when he was serving in the army and was introduced by Du Tao. In June 1947, he joined the Democratic League and was always under the command of Li Yiping. In February of this year, after several secret discussions, he left Kunming for Zhenkang in March, intending to launch an uprising there. Due to insufficient environmental conditions and people's aversion to chaos, he went to Dachan. After extensive contact, he gathered over 2,000 cadres, over 200 rifles, 3 local cannons, and new weapons, and operated in various parts of Western Yunnan, such as Dayao, Yao'an, Yanfeng, Huaping, and Yongren, gradually gaining momentum. At its peak, there were 3,000 people. The bandit side provided very little supplies, all relying on robbery and apportionment to maintain their livelihood, which was extremely painful. The internal gradually dispersed. Later, after military suppression and strict searches by township security teams, they could not gain a foothold in the Dayao area and had to risk coming to Kunming to seek another development. Bandit Duan also admitted that the Communist bandits had used sweet words to incite him, saying that after his uprising, they would give him full support. Unexpectedly, after the launch, he never received any help, resulting in this tragic failure. He deeply hoped that those who were deceived into participating in the activities of the traitorous bandits could realize their past mistakes as soon as possible and return to the right path to avoid the suffering of the people and deepen the condemnation of their conscience.</p>
<h3>Situation in Baoding Increasingly Bright</h3>

<p>[Our Correspondent in Beiping, 11th] The Nie bandit's Second Column has moved to the Sanggan River area and intends to attack Yuxian County. Also, the entire Sixth Column of Teng has moved from Laishui through Zijing Pass to the Yanbei area in southern Chahar.</p>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Beiping, 12th] The North China Suppression Headquarters reports: (1) Over 100 Communist bandits attacked Yuli Dawangjing in the eastern suburbs of Beiping at 1:00 AM yesterday. After being attacked by the self-defense forces, they fought for one and a half hours and fled northeast.

<h3>Over 400 Surrendered Youths Volunteer to Suppress Bandits, Approved</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Lanzhou, 12th] The Northwest Military and Political Chief Executive Office's Patriotic Youth Training Brigade has graduated. Four hundred and three youths, including Chang Peiting, who previously surrendered to the government, volunteered to suppress bandits and have been generously approved by the authorities. They will immediately go to the front line to work and have issued a letter to the youth of the bandit army, criticizing the Communist bandits for fabricating facts and insulting the Central Government. They said: We who have surrendered already enjoy the same treatment as the National Army. We hope you will return to the fold.</p>
<h3>Deng Baoshan Visits Fu Zuoyi</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Beiping, 12th] Deng Baoshan went to the western suburbs to visit Fu Zuoyi on the 12th to discuss Northwest military affairs. It is reported that Deng's intention to resign has been dispelled. He told reporters: If there is a major war in the Northwest, it will be after the autumn harvest. Datong is the throat of northern Shanxi and eastern Suiyuan and is an important strategic stronghold that may become the target of the Communist bandits' intrusion this autumn. When reporters asked about the reaction to the currency reform in the Northwest, Deng said: As long as there is millet to eat in the Northwest, everything is no problem.</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, Beiping, 12th] Fifty residents from various districts in the suburbs of Beiping who have made contributions to assisting the military in clearing bandits (including district chiefs, members of the people's self-defense forces, women's checkpoint sentries, and young children from the railway service team, some as young as fifteen years old) received honorary awards from Commander-in-Chief Fu on the evening of the 11th. The award ceremony was extremely grand. Chairman Chu Xichun of Hebei Province, Minister of Civil Affairs Yu Chunzhai, and over 100 residents attended.

<h3>Grain Ripens and Soybeans Are Fragrant in the Northeast; Bandit Troops Stir Restlessly</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Pan Yang, 12th] As the autumn harvest approaches, grain is ripening and soybeans are fragrant in the Northeast. Bandit troops have been frequently mobilized in recent days and are actively organizing stretcher teams to transport supplies, preparing for war. The National Army is stepping up efforts to assist the people in the autumn harvest and has established a People's Self-Defense Committee. According to military assessments, there may be larger-scale battles within the month.</p>

<h3>Zhao Bingyu's Remarks</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Nanjing, 12th] Dr. Zhao Bingyu spoke freely about the relationship between China and Korea at the press conference and answered questions about the current situation in Korea. He first explained that the purpose of his trip was to represent President Syngman Rhee in paying respects to President Chiang and thanking the Chinese government and people for their assistance and sympathy to Korea's struggle for independence over the past forty years. China has protected Korean residents in China, allowing them to live safely and engage in national restoration work. President Chiang Kai-shek at the Cairo Conference and the Chinese representative in the United Nations delegation to Korea have provided decisive support and sympathy for Korea's independence. He said: The primary task of Korea after the establishment of an independent government is to revitalize the national economy, stabilize society, and unify the North and South to save the people of North Korea from the Soviet Union. The Korean government will overcome all difficulties to achieve this goal and hopes to continue to receive the sympathy of the Chinese government and people. At this point, he pointed out that there are still a few people in China who do not fully understand the establishment of the South Korean government, and a major newspaper has even published articles criticizing it. In fact, Korea should have its own autonomous government established for its freedom, independence, stability, and revitalization. However, the Soviet Union refuses to abandon its policy of using Korea as its balance of power base, so the United Nations Commission on Korea cannot complete the unification of North and South Korea. The openness and freedom of the South Korean elections were witnessed by the staff of the United Nations delegation to Korea. The South Korean government is by no means a so-called puppet government. He once came to China in 1926. This time, he feels like he has returned home. When he was studying as a child, he admired Confucius and Mencius. After coming to China, the famous cities and historical sites are even more unforgettable. He strongly believes that China and Korea have the same cultural traditions and the same problems. The goals of the two countries' struggles are also consistent. He hopes that they will work together in the future for the prosperity of Asia and the peace and democracy of the world. Then, in answering reporters' questions, he frankly admitted that if the U.S. and Soviet troops withdrew from Korea, a civil war might be inevitable. Although the South Korean government will devote itself to domestic unification, it has no intention of using force. However, the Chinese and Korean Communists have long colluded, and the inability to achieve reconciliation on internal Korean issues is just like what China is encountering. If the Soviet Union continues its attempt to conquer the world, the future is difficult to be optimistic about. South Korea currently has well-trained armed police of tens of thousands. The armed forces of the North Korean Communists are stronger because they have been cultivated by the Soviet Union. Regarding the U.S. military presence, he said: The U.S. has no territorial ambitions, and the military presence will not harm sovereignty. Korea and the U.S. have reached a temporary agreement on the military presence, and this agreement will be submitted to the Third Session of the UN General Assembly to be held in Paris. As for Japan-Korea relations, due to more than forty years of hostility, Koreans still inevitably feel disgusted today, but after the peace treaty is signed, the Korean government will still engage in repairing relations between the two countries. Koreans are also wary of the U.S. supporting Japan and hope that MacArthur will not be too lenient with Japan and allow it to rebuild its military. Finally, Zhao also sincerely wished for China to achieve peace.</p>

<h3>Guangzhou Launches Strict Anti-Smuggling and Blocking Network; Flow of Hot Money to the South Blocked; Bank Requests for Relaxation of Remittance Restrictions Denied</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Guangzhou, 12th] In order to prevent the large amount of hot money flowing from Shanghai to Guangzhou and then to Hong Kong recently, the Guangzhou Economic Supervision Office is paying full attention to anti-smuggling and blocking work. Bao'an is the first blocking line, Zhongshan is the second blocking line, and the Pearl River Delta is the sea blocking line, strengthening the anti-smuggling forces to prevent the flow of hot money.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Guangzhou, 12th] The flow of hot money from Shanghai used to be extremely turbulent for a while. These speculators used the Shanghai-Hong Kong-Guangzhou triangle to gain huge profits. In order to curb this frenzy that harms the country, the authorities have launched a close inspection network in recent days. And because of the restriction of the amount of remittances from banks, the tide of hot money flowing south has been blocked.</p>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Guangzhou, 12th] The implementation of the control of bank remittances here has had a great impact on the business of various banks. The daily remittance limit for each bank in the city is 100,000 yuan, and the average share of each of the 29 banks is only 3,400 yuan. Each remittance order must not exceed 500 yuan, which is a huge difference compared to the tens of thousands of yuan per order before the restriction. The City Banking Association recently sent a special representative to the supervisor to request that the remittance restriction be slightly relaxed. Huo Bao-shu replied that due to legal restrictions, it was not convenient to allow it and hoped that the banking community would take the overall situation into consideration and endure it temporarily. Also, the Economic Supervision Office recently ordered the Guangzhou Municipal Government to review the price limits for the public service, hotel, and film industries in Guangzhou because they were too high.</p>
<h3>The Authorities Pay Close Attention to the Results of Economic Reform; The Original Resolution of No Change in Principles but Continuous Improvement of Techniques; Investigation of Production Equipment in Tianjin, Beijing, and Hebei</h3>
<p>[Our newspaper, Nanjing, 12th] It was rumored that the authorities, to cooperate with economic reform, were working on a comprehensive political reform. According to sources, this is now a thing of the past. The authorities are currently focused on the results of economic reform. Although the party affairs reform plan is being finalized, the original political reform proposal has been temporarily suspended.</p>
<p>[Our newspaper, Nanjing, 12th] Finance Minister Wang Yun-wu paid a visit to Premier Weng on the morning of the 12th, talking for dozens of minutes. It was rumored that there was a meeting at Premier Weng's private residence on the morning of the 12th, but according to investigations, this was not true.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Beiping, 12th] Zhang Lisheng, Deputy Director of the Executive Yuan, told reporters with a firm attitude: "Please remember these two sentences: 'The government is determined to use political power to support the success of economic reform,' and 'The economic reform plan will not be revised in principle.'" Zhang went on to explain that while it is generally believed by scholars that economic problems must be solved by economic means, which has its own merits, in the current situation of our country, the thorough implementation of economic reform must be supported by political power to succeed. Although this is very unfavorable to a minority of people, we cannot sacrifice the economic lives of the majority of the people by appeasing a minority. As for the economic reform plan, the implementation techniques should be improved at any time, but in principle, there will be no change whatsoever. Zhang continued: "In order to achieve the goal of increased production, an investigation will be conducted on the existing production organization's equipment and its production capacity in Tianjin, Beijing, and Hebei, so as to provide effective assistance to their required funds, raw materials, and marketing issues. The government is particularly concerned with the appropriate coordination of three tasks: the outlet for idle funds, the source of materials, and price control. "Zhang then made a clear distinction between legitimate merchants and unscrupulous merchants. All those who have storefronts, register with the government, join trade associations, and bear various government taxes are legitimate merchants, and the government is determined to protect them, and the goods they display cannot be regarded as hoarding. On the contrary, those who have no storefront, or even no fixed address, have not registered, and do not bear national taxes, and hoard materials with large amounts of funds to speculate for profit are unscrupulous merchants, and everyone is entitled to report them. When asked by reporters about the large-scale hoarding cases uncovered in recent days, and how they would be handled if their status was special, Zhang replied: "Before the law, no matter what status or identity, there are no exceptions. If I (Zhang Lisheng referring to himself) have hoarding and speculation behavior, others can report me, and I will be severely punished according to the law."</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>The Common People's Shanghai!</h3>
<p>Yesterday, Chiang Ching-kuo, the Economic Control Supervisor of the Shanghai District, delivered a passionate speech to thousands of people at the Youth Army Friendship Association. He loudly pointed out: Shanghai needs to change, and it is changing, and he believes that it can definitely become passable. He said that Shanghai is not a calm Shanghai, but it will have to go through a considerable period of storms, but the common people must be able to withstand the storms and welcome this change. He is determined to be a "servant" for the common people, to eradicate social vermin, and to turn this "paradise of adventurers" into the Shanghai of the common people.</p>
<p>From the enthusiastic emotions of thousands of people applauding and cheering for an hour, we can see the sincerity of the common people. The common people almost regarded Supervisor Chiang, who had the courage to lead the economic revolution movement, as a character in a legendary novel. However, we must recognize that the completion of this economic revolution cannot rely solely on a legendary hero, but must depend on the cooperation of the broad masses of the people.</p>
<p>Indeed, China should have a major transformation now, not just Shanghai. We hope that Shanghai can truly become the Shanghai of the common people; we hope even more that the entire China can become the China of the common people. The Republic of China should have been the China of the common people, but why is it that we only heard the call for "the Shanghai of the common people" yesterday? The reason can be worth our deep thought.</p>
<p>Shanghai, in the writing of an Italian writer, has been written as a "paradise of adventurers." Shanghai has always seemed to be filled with a miasma, a complete darkness. In fact, if Shanghai had nothing to recommend it, then Shanghai would not be worth such attention. The reason why the government attaches importance to Shanghai is because Shanghai has its leading position, and its position of contributing to the country. Shanghai has its dark side, and it also has its bright side, just as the whole of China also has its dark side and bright side. What Shanghai needs to change is to clear away its darkness and promote its brightness. We must sweep away the miasma in the midst of storms and return it to a bright world.</p>
<p>It is still Shanghai, before "August 19," it was often cursed by the whole country, but after "August 19" until today, in just three weeks, it has received the attention of the whole country. Chengdu has the call to "quickly learn from Shanghai," Beiping posted the slogan "Learn from Shanghai," and Guangzhou also said that "Guangzhou can also do what Shanghai has done." This is all the glory of Shanghai! And this glory is brought to us Shanghai people by the "change" led by Supervisor Chiang in the past twenty days. The Shanghai in the eyes of the common people, although still in the prelude period of storms, believes that the bright world will definitely come soon. If the governments and people of all regions can truly learn from Shanghai, learn from Shanghai, and do everything that Shanghai has done, then the common people will not only control Shanghai themselves, but the common people will also one day truly control China. Originally, Shanghai had a leading role in the country, and the common people of Shanghai supported this change with all their strength, and the glory of Shanghai can be maintained for a long time.</p>
<p>There is no doubt that the common people are now using their utmost enthusiasm to support Supervisor Chiang's strict and vigorous iron-fisted policy to promote this reform. The most innocent are the common people; the most pure are also the common people. The Shanghai and China that the common people currently hope for in their hearts is only a Shanghai and China with stable prices and a happy and peaceful life, without much extravagance, and to seek its stability and its peace, the root cause is only the word "rule of law". Whether it is suppressing chaos or building the country, all political, military, and economic measures, whether they are lenient or fierce, or relaxed or tense, cannot but use the law as a tool to correct chaos and restore order. "In times of chaos, use severe penalties," this is a well-known saying, and the so-called severe penalties are still within the scope of "law". The common people of Shanghai hope to beat tigers, catch scalpers, and swat flies. All those who violate laws and regulations, regardless of unscrupulous merchants, corrupt officials, local tyrants, or evil gentry, should be brought to justice and made to submit to the law without any complaint. This is the victory of the law, the victory of the common people. It is necessary to make the wealthy families and giants who were beyond the law in the past subject to the same laws as peddlers and hawkers. This is justice, this is fairness, this is the bright world that the common people hope for.</p>
<p>The financial and economic emergency measures order of "August 19" is the beginning of China's most urgent economic revolution, and it is only allowed to succeed, not allowed to fail. On the one hand, the common people are eagerly hoping that the authorities implementing the policy, from the central government to the local government, not just in Shanghai, will all stand in the homes of the people, strictly handle matters according to the law, without any accommodation. The law was originally formulated to protect the interests of the majority of the people, so enforcing the law is protecting the interests of the majority of the people. The law should be the fairest and most impartial. The punishment should not be heavier because the offender is a peddler or hawker, nor should the penalty be lighter because the offender is a wealthy family or giant, and vice versa. The common people have no extravagant hopes today. They only hope that the government authorities will all punish all those who violate laws and regulations based on the various laws specified in the emergency measures order, so that this "paradise of adventurers" will forever become the Shanghai of the rule of law, the Shanghai of the common people. Standing on the position of the common people, we applaud Supervisor Chiang's call and welcome the arrival of "the Shanghai of the common people!"</p>

<h3>Abundant Harvest from Blasting the Tiandu Iron Mine on Hainan Island</h3>
<p>[Our newspaper, Haikou, 12th] A telegram from Yulin Port: The Tiandu Iron Mine of the Hainan Iron Mine Bureau successfully blasted the mine with explosives for the first time on the 10th, yielding approximately 100,000 dan of ore.</p>
<h3>Aluminum Mine Discovered on Kinmen Island; Taiwan Aluminum Company Decides to Trial Mine; There Must Be More Aluminum Mines Along the Coastal Areas of Fujian and Guangdong</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Taipei, 12th] Taiwan Aluminum Corporation recently discovered a high-grade aluminum mine on Kinmen Island, Fujian, and has decided to trial mine it and transport it to Taiwan for aluminum smelting. In the past, the company relied on aluminum mines in Southeast Asia as raw materials, importing 10,000 tons last year. In July this year, it originally planned to mine the aluminum mine in Zhangpu, Fujian. The geological expert Smithman of the American Reynolds Metals Company, who was sent by the company to take charge and accompany him to Fujian, accidentally discovered a wide distribution of laterite areas when he flew near Xiamen, overlooking Kinmen Island. Moreover, because the climate there is suitable for the formation of aluminum mines, he believed that the island might contain aluminum mines, so he immediately dispatched engineer Qiao Zhenli to conduct on-site survey and excavation. After testing the samples, it was proved to be aluminum ore, and its quality was better than that of Zhangpu. The estimated reserves are about 110,000 tons. The company has now established a trial mining institution. According to the company, the quality of the aluminum mine on Kinmen Island is very similar to that produced in Southeast Asia and is suitable for Bayer's method of extraction. However, the content of vaporized aluminum is slightly lower, and the content of silicate (SiO2) is slightly higher. Therefore, the amount of ore used in extraction will be slightly more than that of Southeast Asian ore. It is estimated that it takes about four tons of Southeast Asian ore to smelt one ton of pure aluminum, and five tons of Kinmen Island ore will be needed. Also, because the silicate is higher, the consumption of caustic soda during extraction will also be higher. It is estimated that the consumption of caustic soda will increase by about 50% per ton of aluminum smelted, which will slightly increase the company's production costs. However, because foreign exchange can be saved, it is still worth mining. Kinmen Island is only 30 kilometers away from Xiamen, and the ships are very convenient, and the public security is good. Because aluminum mines have now been discovered in Zhangpu and Kinmen Island one after another, the company believes that there must be other places along the coastal areas of Fujian and Guangdong that contain more aluminum mines.</p>
<h3>Fujian Provincial Assembly Cables the President Requesting Fujianese to Govern Fujian</h3>
<p>[Our newspaper, Xiamen, 12th] The Fujian Provincial Assembly recently convened a resident committee because of a report that the provincial government was about to be reorganized, and firmly advocated that Fujianese should govern Fujian. On the 10th, it telegraphed the President, saying: "According to reports, the Fujian province will be reorganized soon. The rule of Fujianese by Fujianese is the unanimous demand of the people. I implore you to adopt it and follow the trend."</p>
<h3>Yan Guofu's Conversation</h3>
<p>Excess goods are related to tonnage; no suspicion of malpractice can be assumed.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 12th] Yan Guofu, former director of the Shandong-Qingdao branch of the Executive Yuan, stated in a conversation with Wang Pingyi, director of the Shandong Social Affairs Department, on the 13th that the discovery of excess goods in the warehouse during the handover of the Shandong-Qingdao branch and the suspicion of malpractice was defended. It is said that the tonnage listed in the handover list was based on the long ton figures allocated by the head office with the personnel of the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA), and the long ton was slightly longer than the metric ton. When distributing goods, this situation was included in the material overage account and reported to the head office. Therefore, the quantity of materials handed over exceeded the quantity recorded in the list, and this cannot be considered as malpractice.</p>
<h3>Zhenjiang Establishes a Branch Station to Recruit Youth for Military Service</h3>
<p>[Our newspaper, Zhenjiang, 12th] Cheng Jianzhang, director of the second branch station of the Youth Army Jiangsu-Zhejiang-Henan-Lu-Anhui Recruitment Headquarters of the First Training Office of the Army, led cadres to Zhenjiang on the 12th to establish a station to recruit out-of-school and unemployed youths who aspire to join the army, and found Jingjiang Middle School as the recruitment office. It is heard that the branch station has also established branch stations in various counties in northern Jiangsu.</p>
<p>[Another Telegram] Zhou Huanan, commander of the two Jiangsu garrison districts, arrived in Zhenjiang from Changzhou on the 12th to supervise the conscription in Zhenjiang County.

<h3>Changchun Prices Generally Stable</h3>
<p>Rescuing the Dying Movement Saves More Than 8,000 People</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Changchun, 11th] Our military and civilians have been defending Changchun arduously for nearly four months. Due to the entry of airdrop supplies into a fixed-time and fixed-quantity schedule, and the completion of defense works on all lines, the hardships of the military and civilians for four months have been greatly comforted. Even this important town in the northeast has always stood tall with the heroic posture of being unbreakable by attack and indestructible by siege. The withered grass and fallen leaves here have reported that autumn is deep, and the cold frost is urging people to prepare to welcome the arrival of winter. The news of currency system reform seems to have given this isolated city, separated by land and air, a good impression. Over the past two weeks, prices have obviously been generally stable, and the upsurge of food prices has also stopped. The anxiety and tension of Changchun citizens for several months have been alleviated due to the stability of prices. Except for the occasional faint sound of gunfire, no one can directly feel that they are under siege by bandit troops. If the Changchun airport can safely receive aircraft landings at present, and the bank resumes opening internal remittances, Changchun can obtain full stability.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Changchun, 12th] According to statistics from the Civil Affairs Bureau of the city government, since the garrison launched the rescue-the-dying movement, as of the 12th of this month, more than 22.2 billion yuan of circulating notes have been issued for emergency relief, saving 8,520 poor people.</p>

<h3>Surprising Coal Mine Discovery in Hubei Province; Reserves Reach 3.5 Billion Edible Tons</h3>

<h3>Wuhu's Grain Market is Facing a Crisis; Yuxi Dongba Has a Tendency to Replace It; Rice Industry Giants and Opinion Leaders Call for Self-Reliance</h3>
<p>[Our newspaper, Wuhu, 12th] The new building of the Wuhu Grain Market opened at No. 16 Huasheng Street on the 12th. Hundreds of members of the rice and transportation industries attended. Lü Shaohua presided over the ceremony. Members of the two industries expressed that the Wuhu Rice Market has been facing high labor costs recently. Grain imports and exports pass through Yuxi on the north bank of the Yangtze River and Dongba on the south bank, and are taxed and transshipped without passing through Wuhu. This crisis is still continuing. It costs 3.40 Jin Yuan for every stone of rice to move up and down, and there are other demands. Bao Cang, publisher of Wuhu Edition of the Grain Daily, believes that the 6% ad valorem self-defense special tax on grain in Anhui Province should be abolished, which is also a good medicine to reduce the export price of rice in Wuhu. Today, the four giants of the Wuhu rice industry, Li Nianci, Cai Yushu, Wang Zhupu, and Tao Yinhuai, did not attend the meeting. It is heard that they are dissatisfied with people outside the rice industry trying to control the grain market. The Wuhu Rice Market was originally formed by the division of the Zhenjiang Xiashi Rice Market. For decades, it has been engaged in collecting and distributing grain on both sides of the Yangtze River. Now, it is facing crises such as high expenses and uncoordinated personnel. The guidance and correction in the future depend on the efforts of the two departments of the Grain and Social Affairs and the self-reliance of the Wuhu rice industry. Otherwise, small rice markets such as Yuxi and Dongba will replace the ancient market opened by Li Hongzhang.</p>

<h3>Haikou Lacks Subsidiary Currency; Difficult Trade in the Market</h3>
<p>[Our newspaper, Haikou, 11th] Since the issuance of the Gold Yuan Coupons here, prices have stabilized and people's hearts have settled. However, most of the new banknotes issued by various banks are in denominations of five yuan and ten yuan, and there are very few subsidiary currencies of one yuan and below, making it difficult to make change, and trade in the market is almost at a standstill. Everyone hopes that subsidiary currencies of one corner and below can be transported here as soon as possible.</p>

<p>The People of Kang and Tibet Believe in the Gold Yuan and Support the Government's Currency System Reform</p>
<p>[Our newspaper, Ya'an, 11th] Wang Yaokun, the Kangding city defense commander, came here on official business. According to him, since the central government changed the currency, the provincial government immediately implemented the implementation measures. All commodity prices are sold at the August 19 prices, and have not fluctuated so far, which is very good. The people of Kang and Tibet have great confidence in the new currency and strongly support the government's move.

<h3>Nine Movie Theaters in the Capital Closed Yesterday to Protest the National Theater Tragedy; Commander-in-Chief Sun Expresses Determination to Punish the Culprits Severely</h3>
<p>[This newspaper, Nanjing, 12th dispatch] Nine movie theaters in the capital city were all closed on the 12th to protest the tragedy that occurred at the National Grand Theater on the evening of the 11th. The 12th was a Sunday, and movie theaters in Nanjing were required to screen a free show for soldiers. The employees of the movie theaters still worked as usual.

<h3>The Evins Embezzlement of Taiwan Gold Case; The U.S. Department of Justice Withdraws the Original Lawsuit; Legal Procedures Have Ended, Pending Diplomatic Negotiations</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Taipei, 12th dispatch] The major case of U.S. Army officer Lieutenant Colonel Evins, who entered Taiwan with the Nationalist army at the time of Taiwan's recovery, embezzling a large amount of gold in Taiwan, although it has been publicly tried twice in the United States, was subsequently withdrawn by the U.S. Department of Justice and has now become an outstanding issue between China and the United States. It was recently learned from the Taiwan Provincial Government that when Evins arrived in Taiwan in October of the 34th year of the Republic, he learned from Japanese officer Harada Zuo that there were 120 kilograms of gold in Taiwan and secretly embezzled 60 kilograms, delivering only half of the remaining 60 kilograms to the former Taiwan Provincial Government for receipt. Evins subsequently sold the embezzled gold in Shanghai in November and then retired and returned to the United States. After the case was confirmed by Chinese and American personnel in the 35th year of the Republic, the U.S. Department of Justice filed a lawsuit and held two public trials in Los Angeles, but both failed to reach a verdict due to the jury's inability to agree. The reporter recently learned from the Taiwan Provincial Government that the U.S. Department of Justice has withdrawn the original lawsuit. This case was once widely reported in Chinese and American newspapers and was closely watched by people in both countries. Now that the legal proceedings have ended, it will depend on diplomatic negotiations.</p>

<h3>Foreign Ministers' Representatives to Meet Today to Discuss the Issue of Italian Territories; Great Differences of Opinion Make Achievement Difficult</h3>
<p>[United Press, Paris, 12th dispatch] The French Foreign Ministry announced on the 12th that the new Foreign Minister Schuman of the Guy Cabinet will lead the French delegation to the Foreign Ministers' meeting on the 13th. The Foreign Ministry also confirmed that Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Zixin Shen will represent the Soviet Union. The meeting will be held at the Foreign Ministry at 3:30 p.m. to discuss the guiding principles for the disposition of former Italian colonies. It has not yet been decided who will replace Secretary of State Marshall to attend on behalf of the United States.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 11th dispatch] The U.S. State Department's note to the Soviet Union was quickly answered tonight, rejecting the Soviet claim that the United States had violated the Treaty of Peace with Italy. This afternoon, the Soviet Union accused the U.S. suggestion that each country send only one Foreign Minister representative to participate in the Foreign Ministers' meeting as a violation of the Treaty of Peace with Italy. Tonight, the U.S. State Department delivered a note to the Soviet Embassy, stating that the dispatch of only one Foreign Minister representative to participate in the Foreign Ministers' meeting is a procedure that has precedents in previous Foreign Ministers' meetings. The note also pointed out that the United States cannot accept the Soviet claim that the meeting will be impossible to convene because only Marshall's representative is participating. The State Department stated that the United States has sent copies of its note to the Soviet Union to both Britain and France simultaneously.</p>
<p>According to the U.S. in a previous note to the Soviet Union, unless the Soviet Union offers new suggestions, the meeting will likely be unsuccessful.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Moscow, 12th dispatch] Judging from the tone of the Soviet newspapers, the Soviet government is quite dissatisfied with Britain's dispatch of McNeil to participate in the Foreign Ministers' meeting instead of Bevin. The Soviet Union believes that this will make the progress of the meeting impossible.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, London, 11th dispatch] Well-informed sources say that British representative to the United Nations General Assembly McNeil will take the following positions in Paris on Italy's five colonies in Africa: (1) Somalia: Britain does not object to placing the area under Italian trusteeship. (2) Eritrea: Britain advocates making it an autonomous territory under the government of Abyssinia. (3) Cyrenaica: Britain will maintain the promise made by British Foreign Secretary Eden to the Arab Chief Al-Khoulyusi in 1942 and will never return the area to Italy. (4) Tripolitania: Britain is inclined to follow the wishes of the 45,000 Italian residents. If they advocate returning to Italy, Britain will propose a plan to transfer the area to Italy. (5) Fezzan in Southern Tripolitania: The area was liberated by French General Leclerc's army, and the other residents have expressed dissatisfaction with French rule, so Britain intends to maintain the status quo of the area.</p>
<h3>Berlin Communist Mass Rally Appears in a Demonstrative Manner; Lustgarten Square Turns Red</h3>
<p>[United Press, Berlin, 12th dispatch] Berlin's greatest red demonstration in history was held in Lustgarten Square today. Hundreds of long lines built of flesh and blood converged on the square like hundreds of rivers flowing to the sea. Singing The Internationale, around 11:30 a.m., 20,000 Germans had arrived at the square, which is located in the city center and was once known for its beautiful scenery at the northern end of "Unter den Linden" Avenue.</p>
<p>A slight breeze swept across people's temples, and huge red flags lazily stretched out in the breeze. Hundreds of small red flags, many with the Soviet hammer and sickle symbol, were held by the demonstrators. Lustgarten Square is located in the Soviet-occupied zone and is a traditional good location for demonstrations. The Communist Party launched a demonstration of 80,000 people on May Day, also held there. This conference coincides with the Soviet-proposed "Conference of Victims Under Fascism."</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Berlin, 11th dispatch] According to sources close to well-informed individuals: Although the mass rally supported by the Communist Party has been determined to be a memorial for "victims under fascism," it will undoubtedly appear in a demonstrative manner. Its intention is to target the anti-communist demonstration two days ago. This meeting may even be a communist coup to seize power in Berlin. Today, the insurgents intend to propose to the conference a request to abolish the current Berlin municipal government, which is dominated by the Social Democratic Party, and replace it with a "progressive regime." It is rumored that after the demonstrators pass the resolution, they will march to the city government, where the newly elected municipal government will be established. Observers believe that this type of plan has its possibilities because it is consistent with the general communist methods. However, they believe that the Western occupying powers still occupy three-quarters of the city of Berlin. Under these circumstances, it is unknown how the communists can seize power in the entire Berlin.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Berlin, 11th dispatch] The U.S. military government has prohibited any ceremonies to commemorate the victims under fascism, but Colonel Turbanov, head of the Soviet zone military government, has invited the "Berlin Association of Victims Under Fascism" to hold an exhibition in the Soviet zone.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Berlin, 11th dispatch] Colonel Turbanov, head of the Information Bureau of the Soviet Military Government, delivered a speech at the "Memorial Meeting for Victims Under Fascism" today, stating, "Due to the assistance of British and French reactionaries, Berlin has powerful reactionary forces fighting strongly against progressive forces. At the same time that the Ku Klux Klan is in control in New York, the fascist elements in Berlin were able to tear up the Soviet red flag. The events in Berlin are merely a microcosm of similar events occurring around the world. I am sincerely not a diplomat, but I am an anti-fascist fighter. The power of the Soviet Union has destroyed the war machine of the Third Reich, and it will undoubtedly be able to destroy the forces attempting to organize the Fourth Reich."</p>
<h3>Britain Expresses Opposition to Delaying the Dismantling of German Factories</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, London, 11th dispatch] The British government has opposed accepting the U.S. suggestion to delay the dismantling of factories in West Germany. According to responsible parties, this is because (1) delaying compensation or reducing the dismantling of factories seems likely to have a major reaction in the countries benefiting from the Marshall Plan, because they rely on German reparations for reconstruction. (2) Reducing the dismantling of factories will inevitably endanger neighboring countries by increasing Germany's industrial potential. (3) The British government believes that some German factories are currently idle due to a lack of raw materials. If they are moved to countries with sufficient raw materials, they can resume operation.</p>

<h3>Soviet Embassy in the United States Releases Statement Urging Speedy Conclusion of Peace Treaty with Japan and Demanding that Allied Nations Withdraw Occupying Forces from Japan</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 11th dispatch] In the "Soviet News Bulletin" issued by the Soviet Embassy here on the 11th, there is an article written by Soviet journalist Garinov, claiming that the Soviet Union was the protagonist in defeating Germany and Japan.

The article also criticized the United States for refusing the Soviet Union, Britain, China and other countries the right of veto in the Japanese peace conference.</p>
<p>[United Press, Tokyo, 12th dispatch] Following the Soviet Union's sudden suggestion to conclude a peace treaty with Japan as soon as possible and "quickly" withdraw the occupying forces, qualified Japanese observers stated: If the United States withdraws from Japan in the near future, it will be harmful rather than beneficial to Japan, because the Communist Party can arbitrarily stir up trouble and plunge the country into trouble. A senior Japanese official said: "The withdrawal of troops is a very dangerous attempt and is exactly what the Soviet Union wants.</p>
<p>[United Press, Paris, 11th dispatch] Guy's financial plan, apart from the details, is nothing more than a reprise of the financial plan that Marie and Schuman twice submitted to Congress earlier this month. Both Marie and Schuman resigned because the plan failed to pass Congress. But at this time, all parties are well aware that other plans for financial reform have failed, and at the same time, it may even end the "Third Force" centrist regime in France.</p>

<p>Many Young Students Tend to Lean Left</p>
<p>[United Press, Tokyo, 12th dispatch] Japanese lawmakers are planning to form a committee in the Diet to investigate "anti-Japanese activities." The planned committee will investigate the activities of the Japanese Communist Party, as it is generally criticized for obstructing Japan's industrial reconstruction.

The initiators of this movement declined to discuss the scope of the committee, but said that the entire discussion will be held at a special session of the Diet next month. Kobayashi, the Secretary-General of the Upper House and one of the initiators, said that he favored setting up the committee in the Upper House rather than in the Lower House, as in the United States.

<p>[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 12th dispatch] In the three years since the war, Japanese politics has become increasingly conservative, even to the point of exceeding the pre-war level. This is because political power is still in the hands of general old bureaucrats and politicians. Therefore, after suffering, Japanese youths have mostly joined various anti-government groups. According to a report from the Ministry of Education instructing all 405 national, public, and private universities and junior colleges to investigate the situation of student groups, the vast majority of students belong to left-leaning groups such as "Communist Party cells," "Young Communist League," and "Social Science Research Association." This tendency is especially prevalent in national schools. Politicians with general foresight are deeply worried about this phenomenon.</p>

<p>A Reader of This Newspaper Generously Donates One Thousand Yuan for Maternity and Education Assistance</p>
<p>Our long-time reader, Mr. Le Sifu, recently came to Shanghai from his hometown for business. He took the opportunity to donate one thousand gold yuan to this newspaper, half of which will be used for the "Reader's Education Assistance Fund" and the remainder for the "Reader's Maternity Assistance Fund." According to Mr. Le, his ancestral home is in Zhejiang, but his great-grandfather moved to Hunan for business. He has been reading this newspaper for over twenty years without interruption. Upon arriving in Shanghai for business, he noticed the large number of out-of-school youth and impoverished pregnant women and decided to donate this sum to fulfill his civic duty.</p>
<p>Note: Although the fundraising for this year's "Reader's Education Assistance Fund" has exceeded the target, the high tuition fees of various schools still leave many applicants unassisted. We hope readers from all walks of life will generously donate to provide timely assistance to these impoverished youth.</p>

<p>仁濟醫院擴充病舍　昨招待各界參觀</p>
<p>Renji Hospital's Expanded Wards Open for Public Viewing Yesterday</p>
<p>[Report from this Newspaper]</p>
<p>Renji Hospital, located at 145 Shandong Middle Road, received a substantial donation from the China Relief Organization and funds allocated by the hospital's board of directors. The hospital has built new rooms in all available spaces on the balconies of various floors to expand the wards. This project has been completed, and the hospital hosted a public viewing for all sectors of society yesterday from 3:00 PM to 5:00 PM. Yesterday, this reporter was guided by Zang Tongchang, the hospital's chief accountant, to visit various departments. The newly built rooms were still wet with paint and will be used as nurses' dormitories, first-class maternity rooms, and special-class patient rooms. The best of the special-class rooms cost approximately ten gold yuan per day, while the ordinary wards are spacious and well-lit, costing only eight jiao of gold yuan per day. The hospital previously had eleven special-class beds, ten first-class beds, forty-three second-class beds, and two hundred and sixty third-class beds. The new building adds ten special-class beds, seventeen first-class beds, thirty-three second-class beds, and forty third-class beds. The hospital is well-equipped, with some injections and medications made in-house at lower prices than those on the market, with specialized pharmacists in charge. The X-ray department already had several X-ray machines, and recently, the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) donated a large X-ray machine, estimated to be worth $40,000 USD. One of the bulbs was damaged during transportation but has been replaced from the United States and will be available for use soon. The hospital has fifty-nine doctors, all graduates of reputable domestic universities such as St. John's, Shanghai Medical College, Tongji, and Tongde, as well as those who have studied abroad. Yesterday was Sunday, and outpatient services were suspended, but many emergency patients arrived and were treated immediately, which was convenient for the patients' families.</p>
<p>冒充經濟警察　意圖索詐被拘</p>
<p>Impersonating Economic Police, Attempting Extortion, Arrested</p>
<p>[Report from this Newspaper]</p>
<p>Yesterday morning at 9:00 AM, a man in civilian clothes, about thirty years old, came to the China Confectionery Company at 165 Honggong Tanggu Road. He pointed to the wine in the display window and claimed that it was being sold above the price limit. He identified himself as an economic investigator from the police station and stated that selling above the price limit would result in a two-day suspension of business. Only the housewife and some apprentices were in the store at the time, and in her panic, she pleaded to avoid the penalty. Seeing that she was an easy target, the man said he would return at 8:00 PM to enforce the penalty.</p>
<p>When the store owner returned and learned what had happened, he knew that the wine was being sold in compliance with the law and that he had records to prove it. Instead of waiting for the man to return, he went to the Hongkou Police Station to explain the situation. Section Chief Xu Shibin, after investigating the incident, ordered officer Song Hanshui and auxiliary police officer Zhang Kunyuan to go to the store to verify the facts.</p>
<p>At 8:00 PM, the man arrived as promised. Officer Song confronted him and quickly realized that his statements were evasive. When asked for identification, it was discovered that he was an impostor attempting extortion. He was immediately arrested. The man's name is Huang A'gen, and he is currently being interrogated by the Hongkou Police Station.</p>

<p>Transportation Company Adopts Fuel Savers to Improve Operations</p>
<p>In order to save gasoline, maintain operations, and conserve foreign exchange, the Preparatory Committee of the Public Utilities Bureau's Public Transportation Company, under the direction of Zhao Zengjue, the concurrent chairman, instructed the committee's technical team leader, Miao Ji, to actively research the installation of fuel savers. He also collaborated with Xu Mingcai, the director of the Central Chemical Factory Preparatory Office of the Resources Committee, to research and manufacture carbon-clearance crystals needed to save gasoline. Practical experiments were conducted in July and August, showing particularly positive results for buses traveling through busy urban areas. The Transportation Company is now manufacturing its own fuel savers and will begin testing them on the Route 3 bus line starting next week. It is reported that these fuel savers can save about one-tenth of the gasoline in areas with many traffic lights. If successful on Route 3, they will be tested on busy routes such as Routes 10 and 14. However, the fuel-saving effect of these fuel savers is not significant in areas with few traffic lights.</p>

<p>Citywide People's Service Stations Convene Letter-Box Chiefs' Meeting Yesterday, Urging Citizens to Report Illegal Merchants</p>
<p>In order to implement the new economic decrees, Economic Supervisor Jiang Jingguo specifically ordered the People's Service Stations in each district of the Suppression Banditry Brigade to convene letter-box chiefs' meetings. The ten service stations throughout the city convened letter-box chiefs' meetings in the morning and afternoon yesterday. The station chiefs, representing Jiang Jingguo, declared the government's determination to implement economic reforms. They urged citizens to cooperate closely with the government to achieve success. They stated that if the economic policies were obstructed and failed, the foundation would collapse, and the people would suffer the most. Therefore, they urged citizens to assist the government in promoting economic inspection at the grassroots level by "focusing on small matters" and reporting merchants who illegally raise retail prices. The station chiefs also stated that the government has absolute control over resources, and this is not just empty talk to stabilize public morale. Facts will soon demonstrate this, and they hope that citizens will adopt a calm and composed attitude and endure this transitional period with perseverance.</p>
<p>鎮壓物價的蔣經國　並非是傳奇中人物　昨應漁管處邀與記者羣同作浦江之遊</p>
<p>Jiang Jingguo, Who Suppresses Prices, Is Not a Legendary Figure; Yesterday, He Accepted an Invitation from the Fisheries Administration to Cruise the Huangpu River with a Group of Reporters</p>
<p>[Special Report from This Newspaper]</p>
<p>In recent years in Shanghai, whenever prices rose or the economy and finance fluctuated, rumors would circulate that the central government had sent a high-ranking official to Shanghai to investigate and supervise. As a result, the rising tide of prices would gradually recede. Everyone was curious about who this high-ranking official was who possessed the "power" to suppress prices. No one could say for sure, but it was always said to be Jiang Jingguo.</p>
<p>After the August 19th currency reform, Jiang Jingguo finally appeared before the people of Shanghai as the Economic Supervisor of the Executive Yuan. In the two weeks since his office was established, he has rarely made any public statements, and his photos have not been seen in newspapers. However, the "tigers" whom no one dared to offend in the past are being taken down one by one without any favoritism. Warehouses filled with three months' worth of gauze are being confiscated, regardless of the owners' backgrounds. Anyone who raises prices is being investigated and arrested. This unprecedented, radical approach has finally anchored the Shanghai price market, which was accustomed to causing trouble. In the month since August 19th, price fluctuations have been kept to a minimum. The general public is celebrating and relieved. However, people on the streets are still talking about Jiang Jingguo, even regarding him as a legendary figure.</p>
<p>Hair Tousled, He Steps Onto the Boat</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon, Director Zhao of the Fisheries Administration prepared a fishing boat and invited the press to cruise the Huangpu River. Jiang Jingguo gladly accepted the invitation. The three or four hours of contact deeply impressed people that he is not a legendary figure. On the contrary, he is unpretentious, down-to-earth, and knows how to get things done.</p>
<p>Most of the journalists were dressed impeccably, as they were invited for a holiday outing. However, Jiang Jingguo stepped onto the boat wearing a white short-sleeved Hong Kong shirt, yellow woolen army pants, and black leather shoes. His hair was ungreased and tousled by the wind. He is not very tall, but his sturdy physique and strong hands gave the impression of a man full of perseverance and determination. He brought an older-style reflex camera and chatted and joked with the reporters, eagerly taking photos of them.</p>
<p>Answering Everything with Laughter</p>
<p>The slightly nervous reporters, encountering such a topical news subject, were eager to ask questions. One asked about his impressions of Shanghai, another about his determination to fight "tigers," and another about the need for connections to get housing and telephones, and the exorbitant prices charged by rickshaw pullers. One reporter even said that he had heard that a powerful group in Shanghai was planning to fight against him and bring him down in two months. Everything was discussed, from the trivial to the important, from the past to the present, the lighthearted and the provocative. Jiang Jingguo responded to everything with a laugh. After all, this was a leisurely river cruise, and why should these questions spoil the mood?</p>
<p>Spending Most of the Time Sunbathing</p>
<p>On the boat, everyone was afraid of the sun and tried to find seats in the shade of the canopy. Jiang Jingguo, however, found a chair in the full sunlight. After sitting for a while, he took off his short-sleeved Hong Kong shirt, leaving only a tank top. For most of the time on the boat, he was seen sunbathing. Perhaps this demonstrated his disdain for hypocrisy, his pursuit of practicality, and his spirit of facing the light and seeking the truth.</p>
<p>Director Gao of the Supervisor's Office said: "Mr. Jiang is thirty-nine years old this year. He attended Wan Bamboo Elementary School and Pudong High School. Afterwards, he went to Moscow's Sun Yat-sen University to major in mechanical engineering and study political economics, graduating with honors. During his internship in a Moscow factory, he met a Russian colleague, fell in love, and married. He is now the father of three children."</p>
<p>Doing What Is Beneficial to the Public Before Anything Else</p>
<p>This experience, in terms of innate conditions, is not particularly special. Almost any child from a middle-class family, or even a diligent scholar from a poor family, could complete this experience. Whether or not they are diligent and practical is the key to success. What makes him different is perhaps that he can disregard everything and do what is beneficial to the public before anything else. However, Director Gao humbly said in his brief speech on the boat yesterday: "The work of the Economic Supervisor's Office is social work and requires the power of public opinion to mobilize all levels of society to participate in this arduous task to achieve success."</p>
<p>Director Zhao Junmai of the Fisheries Administration said it well: "Mr. Jiang Jingguo is a master of magic. It's a pity that we didn't bring any props on the boat yesterday; otherwise, he could have shown off his skills on the spot." But perhaps he has a set of endless magic tricks for Shanghai's prices and economy, and will always keep them as calm as the waves on the river yesterday!</p>

<p>「鎳禍」在成都</p>
<p>"The Nickel Disaster" in Chengdu</p>
<p>本報記者周學端</p>
<p>By Our Reporter Zhou Xueduan</p>
<p>〔本報成都七日航訊〕</p>
<p>[Airlifted Report from Chengdu, This Newspaper, 7th]</p>
<p>Since the promulgation of the Emergency Financial and Economic Measures, it has caused a generally positive response in Chengdu, with the people of all of Sichuan enthusiastically embracing this epoch-making economic reform. Unfortunately, immediately following the currency reform, a wave of universally accepting new and old nickel coins swept through Chengdu, agitating the entire market and causing unprecedented social chaos. This is what people call the "Nickel Disaster," which includes: unprecedented corruption by those in charge of economic controls, speculative profiteering, panic buying of all goods, and various strange phenomena such as the market being without prices or trade. This is the most unreasonable phenomenon in the economic suppression of banditry.</p>
<p>通用鎳幣</p>
<p>General Use of Nickel Coins</p>
<p>The so-called new and old nickel coins include copper coins (1 fen), nickel coins (5 fen, 10 fen, 20 fen), and alloy coins (5 fen, 10 fen, 20 fen, half-yuan) minted by the Central Mint from 1937 to 1941, with a total发行amount of approximately over 400 million yuan. Most of them were minted in Chengdu, so they were mostly used near Chengdu. Because they were legal tender auxiliary coins, they had long been abandoned and unused, purchased by the ton for the manufacture of light metal utensils. Some small factories have secretly hoarded several tons. On the 20th, when the new economic policy was announced, it was widely rumored that the Chengdu branch of the Central Bank had received a notice to universally accept them. As a result, speculative trading of nickel coins became rampant, lasting all night, with tens of thousands of people gathered on the streets competing to buy and sell, forming lines more than ten miles long, an unprecedented scene. In the meantime, the Central Bank was used as a base, constantly spreading rumors, causing fluctuations in coin prices, and making speculators go crazy, with some groups manipulating the market from behind the scenes. It wasn't until the航郵copy of this newspaper (dated the 21st) arrived on the 24th, and a news reporter showed the Central Bank's advertisement for the issuance of auxiliary coins to Yang Xiaoci, the manager of the Chengdu Central Bank, that Yang's face suddenly turned pale, and he repeatedly exclaimed, "Oh no, oh no!" At that time, he began to notify the municipal government to announce that all new and old nickel coins would be universally accepted. In those few days of the nickel rush, some people became wealthy overnight, while others were ruined, truly a case of some rejoicing while others grieving.</p>
<p>搶購物資市塲混亂</p>
<p>Panic Buying and Market Chaos</p>
<p>Due to the wide circulation of nickel coins in the past, coupled with the time difference between the issuance of the currency reform order and the announcement of the universal acceptance of nickel coins, speculators tried their best to purchase them in the counties surrounding Chengdu. As a result, the nickel rush flooded the entire city of Chengdu as soon as the nickel coins began to be universally accepted. First, speculators and those with abundant old hoards frantically bought up goods. On the afternoon of the 25th, tens of thousands of people holding nickel coins crowded the prosperous urban areas, scrambling to buy goods. Within three hours, all the goods in department stores and shops in the commercial center of Chengdu, Chunxi Road, were completely bought up. After the 26th, the entire city fell into unprecedented chaos. Any shop that opened its doors was immediately looted. Later, it became a case of buying everything regardless of price or use, with everyone panicking and not knowing what to do. A few merchants took the opportunity to raise prices, while most closed their doors and suspended business. Originally, prices in Chengdu were lower than those in Beijing and Shanghai. Due to the ratio between gold, silver, legal tender, and gold yuan in the currency reform, prices had already jumped several times. The provincial and municipal authorities were unable to decisively control prices when they did not rise, and they also failed to quickly prevent and deal with the situation when nickel coins were openly traded. By the time the nickel rush flooded the market, forming a distorted currency inflation, with the supply of goods unable to meet demand, and prices fluctuating drastically, they were in a rush to artificially suppress prices. Although the municipal government repeatedly declared that it would "borrow heads" to stabilize prices, the market supply and demand had already been out of balance. Goods were being hoarded and not sold. From the 27th to today, daily necessities such as rice, flour, meat, and fuel have completely disappeared from the market. Most citizens have no meat to eat and are waiting for food to cook, with getting a meal considered a rare fortune. This is a phenomenon that has not been seen in Chengdu for decades.</p>
<p>央行經理　難辭其咎</p>
<p>Central Bank Manager Cannot Evade Responsibility</p>
<p>The Chengdu branch of the Central Bank bears the main responsibility for causing this nickel rush in Chengdu. The illegal corruption of Yang Xiaoci, the manager of the bank, is difficult to excuse, leading to popular resentment and public criticism. For days, telegrams denouncing the bank's corruption have been sent to the President and Premier Weng by all the legislators residing in Chengdu, representatives of the National Assembly from Sichuan, Kang, and Chongqing, the Sichuan Provincial Assembly, the Chengdu Municipal Assembly, mass organizations throughout Sichuan, the Sichuan Supervision Office, and the Chengdu Special Criminal Court, who have also filed public denunciations. According to the investigation, the truth about the Central Bank's corruption is as follows: After the Emergency Financial and Economic Measures were announced on the evening of the 19th, the Chengdu Central Bank received an电order from the head office on the 21st to universally accept the coins. Yang Xiaoci, the manager of the bank, was vague and evasive in his talks with reporters, but on the one hand, he secretly dispatched confidants with more than 700 billion legal tender to various places to purchase large quantities of coins at low prices, using his authority. At the same time, from directors to servants, as well as small and large economic groups of banks and commercial firms closely related to the bank, all made claims for all their holdings, day and night, and used various methods to search for large quantities in the urban area and the counties surrounding Chengdu. On the other hand, the Central Bank telegraphed the head office, using explanation as a pretext, to delay the situation. By the time it was forced to announce the policy, the average profit of general illegal speculators within a few days was more than twenty times. Therefore, the universal acceptance of nickel coins led to the nickel rush, panic buying of goods. So the rise of the nickel rush is universally recognized as being caused by the corruption of the Central Bank, with popular sentiment indignant, and everyone calling for a thorough investigation. In the nickel rush, many people's long-term private preparations were purchased by others, leading to friends becoming enemies, families becoming discordant, and several cases of murder and suicide occurring in a single day. Nickel rush! Nickel rush! The nickel rush brought decades of unprecedented suffering to the citizens of Chengdu.</p>

<p>Wujin Xueyan Bridge Robbery Case Solved, Secret Meeting Room of Bandits Discovered, More Than Twenty Loads of Stolen Cocoons Recovered</p>
<p>[Report from This Newspaper, Wujin, 12th]</p>
<p>At midnight on the 6th of this month, the Yimin Lan Firm in Xihuai Village, west of Xueyan Bridge, which collects cocoons for the Yousheng Silk Factory in Wuxi, was suddenly robbed by more than twenty bandits accompanied by two yellow and black German shepherd dogs. They broke into the house and looted for more than two hours, taking away more than twenty-five loads of dry cocoons (worth 30 billion yuan) packed in three small boats. Afterwards, the owner reported the incident to the county, offering a reward of one-third of the value of the stolen goods for information leading to the arrest of the bandits. The criminal police team was dispatched and found that Zhou Rongda, a vagrant in Caojia Village near Tianjing Bridge, was highly suspicious. After跟踪him to Wuxi and observing him secretly, he was arrested when he returned from Wuxi to Changzhou via Danyang. He confessed to the crime and implicated the bandit leaders Lu Daonan and Zhang Tao. On the morning of the 11th, the team led more than forty police officers and drove to Wang Zong祠in Caojia Village to search for the stolen goods. They also searched the house of traitorous bandit Kuang Hanzheng in Kuangjia Village. After a long search, they discovered the secret room where the bandits Lu Daonan and others regularly held meetings, and all the stolen goods were recovered. The suspects Kuang Zhihui, Kuang Xiu, and Shu Rongchang were also taken into custody. When the boat was passing through Tianjing, it was intercepted, but fortunately, there were no casualties in the counterattack. They arrived in the city that night, and the criminals were handed over to the county for interrogation, and the goods were notified to be claimed.</p>

<p>戡亂期間都市徵兵改進意見</p>
<p>Suggestions for Improving Urban Conscription During the Bandit Suppression Period</p>
<p>傅  溥正模</p>
<p>Fu Puzhengmo</p>
<p>A. Investigating and implementing conscription is an indispensable condition for establishing a country, which is an undeniable fact. However, during the eight years of the War of Resistance, the foundation of military administration was destroyed by the enemy, and the old morals also declined. Although there was an opportunity for reorganization after the war, the communist bandits also launched a rebellion, so the investigation and control of保甲cannot be sound, the implementation of government orders cannot be thorough, and the local wealthy and powerful forces have become deeply rooted. Therefore, the implementation of regular conscription is not only difficult to carry out, delaying the replenishment of soldiers, but also the practice of substitution and evasion of military service has spread throughout the country. As for allowing volunteers to enlist, it has become a mercenary system, with soldier brokers rampant, desertion increasing, poor quality of soldiers, and spies mixing in, which wastes manpower and resources and weakens combat strength, with extremely deep harm. In order to cope with the needs of bandit suppression, prevent the wealthy from evading military service, strengthen the quality of soldiers, and truly promote the military system, I would like to offer my humble opinion based on the principle of those who have money contributing money and those who have strength contributing strength, so that it can be improved.</p>
<p>B. Implementation methods</p>
<p>2. Remedying Investigation and Control and Establishing a Military Administration System:</p>
<p>The reasons for inaccurate household registration investigations are twofold: (1) 保甲chiefs each have their own occupation, are weak in ability, and cannot be dedicated to their responsibilities; (2) 保甲chiefs fear power and influence, act perfunctorily, and dare not implement the system effectively. Therefore, it is specifically stipulated that:</p>
<p>(1) The head of each district (town) shall concurrently serve as the commander of the large militia battalion for men of conscription age, under which there shall be several militia platoons for men of conscription age, organized by保. The unit should be composed of men of conscription age from the age of twenty to twenty-five.</p>
<p>(2) The platoon leader shall be elected by the保民 representative at the保民 conference from among the sons of wealthy people between the ages of twenty-one and twenty-five who are studying or living in the city. The保chief shall serve as the deputy platoon leader, and the保team deputy and甲chief shall serve as the platoon deputies.</p>
<p>(3) The platoon leader shall be fully responsible for investigation, control, and command. All matters related to military administration shall be handled by the platoon leader in accordance with the orders of the district (9) town leader. If there is any concealment or dereliction of duty, they shall be the first to be called to military service and shall be re-elected.</p>
<p>(4) The保team deputy shall be responsible for administrative affairs, and the保甲chief shall be responsible for assisting.</p>
<p>(5) After the formation of the platoon, the names, ages, and addresses of the members shall be publicly announced in accordance with the law. If there are any errors or omissions, rewards shall be given for reporting or applying.</p>
<p>(6) The head of the household (guardian) shall be responsible for ensuring that the members of their household (family) never evade military service. Each member shall guarantee each other that they will never evade military service and shall provide a joint guarantee to the platoon leader for safekeeping after the formation of the platoon.</p>
<p>3. Tightening the Scope of Exemption from Military Service:</p>
<p>(1) "Men of the Republic of China have an obligation to serve in the military," as stated in the Constitution. As for the provisions of Article 24 of the Military Service Law regarding the deferment of students, it is to avoid hindering the education of the majority of students, but in fact, the sons of wealthy people often use this to evade military service; secondly, the number of students in school and the number of potential draftees are vastly different, which will not hinder the education of the entire student body; thirdly, according to the implementation of this article, the soldiers recruited are not only not intellectuals, but also poor people, creating a situation in which the poor protect the rich, which greatly affects the morale of the military; fourthly, the second paragraph of Article 24 of the Military Service Law, "Students who are recruited into the army after graduation shall complete reserve cadre education," has not yet been implemented. Because students have not served as soldiers, it not only greatly affects the knowledge level of soldiers, but also gives rise to the notion that the rich never serve in the military. Therefore, the second paragraph of Article 24 of the Military Service Law should be temporarily suspended.</p>
<p>(2) National officials, military officers, military dependents, shop employees, and ordinary employees of factories and mines</p>
<h3>First Prime Minister of Palestine, Jinnah, Dies in Karachi; Foreign Minister Wang Shijie Sends Condolences by Telegram</h3>
<p>[United Press, Bombay, 11th] India News Agency, 11th dispatch: Jinnah, the creator of Pakistan and its first prime minister, died of illness in Karachi late on the 10th, at the age of 71. The news agency quoted a Pakistani public announcement as saying that Jinnah died at 10:25 pm on the 10th in the capital of Pakistan, which is currently celebrating its first anniversary. This "Great Leader" of tens of millions of Muslims in Pakistan and other parts of the Indian peninsula had been ill for some time.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 12th] Prime Minister of Pakistan Jinnah passed away on the 7th. Foreign Minister Wang Shijie sent a telegram on the 12th to the Foreign Minister of Pakistan, expressing deep condolences.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, New Delhi, 12th] Pakistan will declare a 40-day national mourning period to commemorate its founding father and first Governor-General, Jinnah. Jinnah's position in Pakistan was more than that of a constitutional head of state. His death leaves a difficult-to-fill rift in the politics of the newly established Pakistan. Observers here predict that there will be no adverse political developments in Pakistan in the near future. Current Prime Minister Ali Khan will continue to lead the country. The impact of Jinnah's death on Pakistan's future cannot be determined at this time. Whether political forces will tend towards progress or reaction will become more apparent in the future.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, New Delhi, 12th] Governor-General of India Rajagopalachari and Prime Minister Nehru, on behalf of the Indian government and people, offered condolences for Jinnah's death. The Pakistani government said: "We express our deepest condolences for the death of His Excellency Governor-General Jinnah, and to commemorate Jinnah's death, all Indian government offices will fly flags at half-mast." The Indian Governor-General also cancelled all receptions for diplomatic envoys today.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Deccan, 12th] When Pakistan Radio broadcast the news of Jinnah's death this morning, the people here were stunned. The radio station immediately canceled all its daily programs and only broadcast elegies and the Quran. All private social banquets were also canceled, and people went to mosques to hold mourning ceremonies for their leader. It is not yet known when Jinnah's funeral will be held, but the three ministers of Pakistan here have already hired a special plane to go to Karachi to attend Jinnah's funeral.</p>
<h3>Jinnah's Biography</h3>
<p>— From our newspaper's data room</p>
<p>Jinnah, the creator of Pakistan and its first Prime Minister, passed away in Karachi on the 10th of this month at the age of 71.</p>
<p>Jinnah and Gandhi were both the most important figures in modern Indian history. They represented different religions and had particularly divergent political views, but they shared the same desire to seek independence and freedom for India. After India broke away from British rule and became independent, it was divided into two countries: India and Pakistan. The partition of Pakistan was the goal of Jinnah's lifelong efforts.</p>
<p>Jinnah was born in Karachi on Christmas in 1876. He went to England to study in his youth and began practicing law at the age of 20. After returning to India, he was elected chairman of the All-India Muslim League in 1916. After that, he became the political leader of all the Muslims in India and participated in the Anglo-Indian Round Table Conference to discuss the Indian question in 1929.</p>
<p>Jinnah's most important ideal was the autonomy of the Muslim people within India. He believed that due to the various differences between Muslims and Hindus in religion and lifestyle, a perfect result would be difficult to achieve without partition. This was the opposite of Gandhi's idea, because Gandhi advocated unity. Jinnah insisted strongly on the separation of India and Pakistan, and after many setbacks, he finally succeeded. On August 15 last year, India broke away from British rule and became independent, and the Muslim state of Pakistan was born.</p>
<p>Jinnah was tall and serious, and he looked like a calm and capable politician. He often wore a suit, and his home life was very simple. Jinnah's wife passed away many years ago, and his daughter became estranged from him after she converted to Christianity after marriage. In his later years, Jinnah lived with his sister in Karachi. At the beginning of this year, there were rumors that his health was deteriorating, and now he has suddenly passed away.</p>

<h3>Establish a Station at the Mouth of the Wusong River to Inspect Motorized Sailing Vessels</h3>
<p>Since the implementation of economic control in the Shanghai area, Shao Baichang, commander of the Wusong Fortress, in order to prevent the smuggling of materials by boat and to privately go to the bandit area, strengthened the inspection and suppression, and specially united the water, land, military and police agencies to establish a unified inspection station for motorized sailing vessels at the intersection of Songhongyuan Road. It was officially established yesterday, and began office work, and notified all customs brokers that all import and export ships must be inspected.</p>
<h3>The Suppression and Propaganda Task Force Expands Broadcasting Propaganda; Citizens Must Still Work Hard to Complete Three Revolutions</h3>
<p>In order to assist the government in promoting currency system reform, eliminating bandit plots, and practicing economy, the Shanghai Suppression and Propaganda Task Force held an expanded publicity campaign yesterday at the Shanghai Radio Station. All public and private radio stations in the city rebroadcast the lectures from 2:00 pm to 4:00 pm. First, Fang, director of the Municipal Party Department of the Kuomintang, broadcast, saying: (1) The currency system reform has been implemented for more than 20 days, and the situation is quite good, but we must still strictly prevent a small number of unscrupulous merchants from secretly raising prices and trying to revive the black market. Everyone is now supporting Inspector Jiang in fighting tigers, but Mr. Jiang is here to supervise us in fighting tigers. The actual tiger fighting work still requires all citizens to work together under his leadership. At the same time, fighting tigers is not for the government, but for the citizens themselves, and fighting tigers must be thorough and deadly, otherwise the tiger will revive and still eat people.</p>
<p>Practicing Economy and Contributing to Suppression and Reconstruction</p>
<p>(2) In addition to unscrupulous merchants in Shanghai, there are also Communist spies lurking in the market, causing trouble, raising the black market, and undermining the currency system. Today, the Communists and unscrupulous merchants have become one. Therefore, we must eliminate Communist spies at the same time to stabilize prices and stabilize people's livelihood. (3) Reforming the currency system without practicing economy will still not succeed. We should cherish material resources, financial resources, human resources, and time to contribute to the suppression of chaos and national construction, thereby enriching materials and stabilizing prices. Finally, Fang concluded that currency system reform is the current economic revolution, eliminating Communist spies and eliminating corruption is a political revolution, and comprehensive economy is a lifestyle revolution. To make all three points successful, the Shanghai compatriots must first carry them out thoroughly as a model for the whole country. This is the responsibility of the Shanghai compatriots and also the glory of the Shanghai compatriots.</p>
<p>Eliminating the Source of Chaos and Stabilizing Society</p>
<p>Then, Mayor Wu, representing Wang Zhaoquan, broadcasted, saying: "The rise and fall of the world is the responsibility of every citizen." Citizens should not give up the right to advise on national affairs, nor should they evade the obligation to implement national policies. Currency system reform is to adapt to the needs of the times and is related to the success or failure of the suppression of chaos. Everyone must sincerely support it and trust it completely so that the new currency system will be successful. Next, Fan Heyan, representing President Yu of the Central Bank, broadcasted: We must eliminate the Communists and the unscrupulous merchants who are insane and hoard for their own benefit, and strictly prevent them from undermining the new currency system. At the same time, to improve the social economy, we must save consumption and distribute the materials saved by the wealthy class to the majority of people who cannot survive. This is a necessary condition for eliminating the source of chaos and stabilizing society.</p>
<p>Many Programs are Quite Exciting</p>
<p>Next, Wang Xiaozhu broadcasted, saying: Communist bandits are acute murderers, and unscrupulous merchants are chronic murderers. We must eliminate these two major evils to survive, and advise the people of the city to practice economy. In addition, Jin Zhenwang and others also broadcasted separately, and their feelings were very sincere. The programs were quite exciting, including various songs and operas compiled by the task force to support the government's currency reform, elimination of traitors, and economy.</p>
<h3>Police Power Unification Commemoration Conference Commander Xuan Instructs Three Points; Encourage to Love the People</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] Yesterday was the third anniversary of the unification of police power in the city. The Municipal Police Bureau held a simple and solemn ceremony at 9:00 am in the square of the bureau. Director Yu presided over the ceremony. More than 500 officers and police officers and persons in charge of various sub-bureaus attended. Former Director Xuan was also invited to attend and give instructions on three points: (1) After the unification of police power, the work should reverse the past style of the patrol room in the concession era, assist the people, love the people, and truly become the nanny of the people. (2) Persist in a consistent firm style and continue to work hard to eliminate all the stains in Shanghai society without any slackness. Especially when the government promulgates a new economic reform plan, the mission of the police officers is even more important, and they must fully assist in promoting this work to achieve the goal of "only success is allowed, no failure is allowed" instructed by the President. (3) Review the police administration in the past three years. Although great gains and achievements have been made in public security, the work of road police still needs to be strengthened.</p>
<h3>Those Who Love the People are Supported by the People</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] The Youth Army Friendship Association held a members' meeting at the Municipal Gymnasium on South Shanxi Road at 9:00 am yesterday, and invited Economic Supervisor Jiang Jingguo and Fang Zhi, director of the Municipal Party Department of the Kuomintang, to give speeches. More than 2,000 demobilized youth soldiers and thousands of citizens who automatically came to the gymnasium to participate attended the meeting. Later arrivals could not be accommodated in the meeting place, and most of them gathered on the roads of South Shanxi Road and Central Linsen Road to listen to the speeches broadcast from the loudspeakers in front of the gymnasium. In his speech, Jiang vehemently criticized corrupt officials, wealthy and unscrupulous merchants, and firmly stated his confidence that the new economic policy would succeed. His words were passionate and aroused thunderous applause from the military and the masses attending the meeting. The excitement and enthusiasm of the meeting were unprecedented. After Jiang finished his speech, the meeting passed a draft of the Youth Service National Plan and a telegram to the President. At 11:20 am, the meeting ended in music and slogans. Jiang Jingguo left the meeting place, and the Friendship Association led the way with a guide. Thousands of people outside the gymnasium cheered wildly. Traffic on South Shanxi Road was already blocked. Hundreds of residents in the Zhabei District welcomed him in a procession with flags and gongs. The cheers and applause shook the buildings. Before Jiang got into the car, he was surrounded by the people again. The sincerity of the citizens' support and love for Jiang was fully demonstrated in front of the gymnasium yesterday morning. This situation was only seen after the victory when the President first came to Shanghai and accepted the cheers of the people on the balcony of the Municipal Government.</p>
<p>Should Not Over-Enjoy</p>
<p>Jiang's speech first pointed out the poverty of our country, and people should not enjoy too much to pretend to be rich. He said: When I was young, I saw people eating meat every day, but my family didn't have it. My grandmother told me that people had money, but my family didn't have money. Now our country is the same. Our country is poor, and most people don't have enough food and clothing, but some people are sitting in cars that they shouldn't be sitting in and enjoying materials that they shouldn't be enjoying, foreign perfumes, and silk stockings. These things are enough to destroy our national economy. We are poor, and being poor is not terrible. Why do we want to pretend to be rich? But now there is a group of people who are anesthetized by gold, US dollars, and foreign goods, and forget about the nation and the country. Taking Shanghai as an example, how many people can indulge in extravagance? Absolutely a minority. Our country will not allow these minorities to destroy it. We must kill these unfilial descendants of the Yellow Emperor one by one.</p>
<p>China's Survival Depends on National Justice</p>
<p>The reason why China can survive to this day is because there is an underlying national integrity that will never succumb to the enemy. There are many precedents in history, such as Wen Tianxiang, Shi Kefa, and Yue Fei. Whenever the nation is at the final moment of life and death, the whole people rise up and defeat the enemy. During the "July 7th" Incident, Japan challenged us with such a great force. We disregarded everything and resisted the war, and finally defeated Japan. The Communists are implementing the policies of other countries and undermining unity and peace. We must never compromise with them. Some people doubt why we cannot form a coalition government? Yes, we will not be fooled by the Communists. Czechoslovakia can become today's Czechoslovakia, and Romania can become today's Romania. China, which has a glorious national tradition and spirit, must not change.</p>
<p>New Economic Policy is a Turning Point in the Crisis</p>
<p>During the War of Resistance Against Japan, I was in Xichang, Xikang Province, and saw many well-built government office buildings there. I felt very strange. Later, the leader told me that these houses were prepared for the retreat from Chongqing. China resisted the war with weakness against strength. We had the determination to persevere to the end and finally won the victory. The current situation is a crisis and a turning point for the Chinese nation. The promulgation of the new economic policy is a turning point in the crisis. The new economic policy is a social revolution and the beginning of the Three People's Principles. We must concentrate the scattered forces to complete it. Shanghai used to be a paradise for adventurers, but it has begun to change. We want it to continue to change. It must be changed. Speculative markets and unscrupulous merchants hoarding are not allowed to exist in Shanghai. The Three People's Principles guarantee private property and private enterprises. It has been so in the past, it is so today, and it will be so in the future, but unscrupulous merchants who hoard, speculate, and exploit the masses must be eliminated. Unscrupulous merchants have colluded with corrupt officials. Yes, Qi Zaiyu is an example. In the future, whoever is corrupt will be shot. Shanghai is the economic center of the country. We must first overcome the reactionary economic forces in Shanghai to stabilize the country's economy.</p>
<p>Fight to the End with Evil Forces</p>
<p>The new economic policy in Shanghai has been supported and believed in by 5 million citizens. In the past three weeks, in the first week, unscrupulous merchants tried to undermine the price limit. In the second week, black markets for gold, US dollars, and cotton cloth appeared. I arrested a few unscrupulous merchants and confiscated a lot of hoarded goods. In the third week, it calmed down. This proves that the rise in prices is not entirely due to economic reasons and can be overcome by political forces. Now that the main force of reactionary economics has not been eliminated, the economic future of Shanghai is the eve of a storm, but we are not afraid and do not shake, and are determined to fight to the end with evil forces.</p>
<p>What is People's Livelihood?</p>
<p>After I locked up a few big capitalists, some people thought that I was not democratic. What is democracy? It is democracy to use the power of the majority to suppress the minority. Democracy is speaking for the majority, not for the enjoyment of the minority. After Rong Hongyuan was arrested, the capitalists' lackeys spread rumors, saying that 50,000 people relied on him for food and that they would all lose their jobs in the future. What a joke! He is the one who makes money from 50,000 people. After the government confiscated a lot of hoarded goods, some people said that the government was a robber. Among the goods we confiscated, some had been hoarded for more than three years. These goods were no longer commodities, but tools for them to disrupt the market and weapons to exploit the people. They made millions of US dollars in a turn, robbing the money of the majority. This is a robber. Some people also said that if I continue like this, the factories will close. The government has the power of the people. Why can't it take over?</p>
<p>Hard Work, Hard Work, Practical Work</p>
<p>Finally, Jiang offered three points to the members of the Youth Army Friendship Association: (1) Work hard, don't work casually, (2) Work hard, don't work blindly, (3) Work practically, don't work nonsense. He also pointed out that the saying "No merchant is not a traitor" cannot be established if most good merchants are killed. He also corrected the two phrases "Fight the Tiger" and "Justice Jiang", because the former is individual heroism, and now it is concentrating the power of the majority to fight against evil forces, and the latter is the remnant of feudal ideology. Officials are public servants of the people, and it is their duty to eliminate harm for the people. He also said: We are not trying to be happy now, but doing it in a planned way. We want to turn the paradise of adventurers into the paradise of the people of Shanghai.</p>
<h3>Industrial and Mining Construction Promotion Association Teas to Welcome Chen Lifu</h3>
<p>The Chinese Industrial and Mining Construction Promotion Association held a tea party at 3:30 pm yesterday in the meeting room of the Shanghai Sixth District Textile Industry Association in the Yong'an Company's new building to welcome Chen Lifu, deputy speaker of the Legislative Yuan, back to China. More than 50 people attended, including Councillor Chen, Liu Gongyun, Fan Heyan, Xu Guomao, and Zhu Zhuyi. After Chen Zhengshi, chairman of the association, delivered a welcome speech, Deputy Speaker Chen delivered a speech. Chen expounded in detail the ways China should take for economic reform and economic construction. The main points were: (1) Absorb as much foreign capital and production tools as possible to assist China's industrial construction. (2) Private industrial groups can have more contact with foreign industrial circles. (3) In addition to the United Kingdom and the United States, Canada is an emerging industrial country and can be a new friend of China's industrial circles. (4) China's economic construction should pay equal attention to industry and agriculture, and should pay attention to the interests of the majority of the people. After Chen finished his speech, he also answered many questions raised by the members of the association. The tea party did not disperse until about 6:00 pm.</p>
<h3>Dunhuang Art Exhibition Opens Tomorrow</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] The Dunhuang Art Exhibition of the Dunhuang Art Research Institute, sponsored by the Ministry of Education, is scheduled to open tomorrow (the 14th) at the Dasing Company Gallery on Nanjing Road, with more than 700 exhibits. The Institute is also scheduled to entertain all sectors of society this afternoon.</p>
<h3>Director Yu Addresses Encouragement to Double Efforts</h3>
<p>Next, Director Yu Shuping delivered a speech, encouraging the police to humbly accept Commander Xuan's instructions, redouble their efforts, and show their achievements with concrete facts. He also instructed all police officers that in this extraordinary era, police personnel should have the spirit of going against the current and possess revolutionary spirit to be the pillars of society. Then, Commander Xuan personally presided over the awarding of prizes for the Weaver Cup basketball game. The meeting was adjourned at 10:30 am, and the whole group took cars to the Huangpu Branch Bureau Square for a group photo.
