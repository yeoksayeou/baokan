<p>〔本報南京廿五日電〕翁文灝之新行政院，廿五日竟日洽商籌組中。翁氏。五日晨九時晋謁總統，長談四小時，至下午一時始行辭出，翁氏係就政院副院長，各部會首長及正副秘書長名單有所請示，午後即據以分別進行接洽，在洽商確定前，此項名單不致發表。據悉：翁氏新閣人選，經向總統請示後，其遂選原則已定，凡再任無特殊情形者，仍商請留任，以資熟手。靑年黨保留二部長，二政委。民社黨保留一部長，二政委。社會賢達亦有數人任部長及政委。迄廿五日午夜止，新閣名單士部確定，衆料如經其他變化，廿六日有發表之可能。記者廿五日晚向可靠方面探詢，獲悉副院長王雲五將不再蟬聯，其繼任人選尚未擬定，惟原則上必爲北方人士，巳無疑問。秘書長一職，內定李惟果，李現在京臥病，李是否允任尚無所悉。副秘書長人選未定，一般相信顧毓瑔，吳兆棠，均有可能。部會方面，聞外交，交通，地政，工商（即經部），農林，司法行政，衛生，僑務，蒙藏等均將由舊任蟬聯。主計部係新設，將由主計長徐堪出任，翁本人所遺資委會缺，將以孫越崎繼任，國陸部以何應欽代白崇禧，財長會鴻鈞改任央行總裁，將另行遴選，聞蔣廷繼極有可能。外傳爲吳國楨，徐堪等，均不足馮信。水利薛寫弼堅決辭職，聞將留待民社黨保薦。此外，內敦·教育·社會·糧食四部原任均表堅辭，現正洽商挽留中。聞洪蘭友可能繼張厲生出長內政，而谷正綱之社會部畏可望打銷辭意，至政委方面仍將爲七人，國民·靑年·民社三黨各二人，社會賢達一人或均不致有所變動，惟繆嘉銘巳當選立委，其遺缺將就社會賢達中另行遴選一人繼任。</p>
<p>〔本報南京廿五日電〕翁文灝爲繼續三黨合作政策，在籌組新閣之初，特邀同雷於廿五日下午三時分訪民·靑兩黨負責人徐傳霖。曾琦等，請提各參加新閣。惟聞兩黨之表示，認爲應俟立委問題解決後，再談組閣。旋雷震表示，立委問題必逐步解決，而組閣問題則必須首先決定，彼等亦允研商後再行決定·現悉：民社黨徐傳霖等已於廿五日夜車赴滬，召開該黨中常會，討論是否參加政院問題。</p>

<p>〔本報南京廿日電〕新任行政院長翁文灝廿五日宣稱：新政院各部會首長人選，廿五日正在積極進行接洽，須俟獲有結果後始克公布。新政院集會日期，亦將佚人選確定由總統任命後始能確定。翁氏並申述新政院將繼續三黨合作之方針，其人選仍包括民·靑兩黨及無黨派人士，現正與民·靑兩黨積極商治。</p>
<p>翁氏任行政院長命令，廿五日公布後，即於下午四時半在資委會大禮堂舉行記者招待會，以新任院長身份與記者晤談，並答覆詢問。翁氏首稱：值茲國內外局勢多艱，本人受命爲行為第一屆行政院院長，深感才力短絀，職責過鉅，至爲惶懼。惟旣承總統提名，立院同意，衡以匹夫有責之義，不客再爲堅辭。翁氏指出，目前一面實行總政，須依照憲法規定，成立新政府機構，提高其工作效率，俾對國家有所貢獻。同時雖須動員戡亂，不能不特別加緊進行，此兩項工作分頭並進，責任甚重，必須公正積極，認眞革新。翁氏認爲當前最大之困難爲通貨膨脹，物價上升，交通不便，生產减少，致人民生計困難，其原因爲我國八年抗戰之後，未遑生息，即遭共匪叛亂，致成今日形勢。今後政府當針對其原因，對症下藥，儘量設法减少此種困難，早日恢復社會秩序，改善人民生活。關於美援問題，翁氏說明美國鑒於中國经濟上之困難，故盡最大力量，以物資援華，此項援華物資，本人以行政院長地位，當督飭所屬羔爲運用，充份發揮其效果，以减輕經濟危機，解除人民痛苦，並藉此機會以謀國家之復興。翁氏並謂，關於重大方針，總統已於就任時明白指示，今後當與政府同仁共爲推進，目前吾人任務旣建且鉅，待決之問題極多，可能之困難亦復不少，行政院責無旁貸，本人當不顧困難，不計利鈍，勉力從事，藉副全國人民之期望，如不能達成任務時，則當毅然引退，以符憲政精神，所望政府同人開誠合作，社會賢雋及輿論方而多予指教。至具體施政意見，當俟政院組成後再行發表。</p>
<p>翁氏旋答復中外記者之詢問，凡關於新政院人選之問題，翁氏均避作正面回答，惟稱：俟新閣名單公布後，一切均可明瞭。某記渚詢以所謂革新其內容如何？翁氏謂：此際談到內容，爲時尚早。某記者詢問翁氏對過去之外交政策是否滿意，今後翁氏是否仍繼續維持過去政策抑另有所更張？翁氏答稱：外交基本原則，爲誰持國家領士主權之完整至具體辦法，則以國際局勢變化莫定，當隨時注意，並決定應付之策。</p>

<p>〔中央社北平廿五日電〕胡適校長今在平評翁文激氏出長行政院事稱：「我以老朋友身份，希望翁先生用多年來科學的精神和方法，開中國政治上的新風叛，打倒空談，不科學的空談；他有勇氣擔負起政治的責任，我們很高興。」胡氏又翻出民二十一年六月出版的獨立評論三·四兩期，指翁氏所寫「中國人口分布與土地利用」說：「以所知道的中國地下富源和地上的生產力，中國人很少知道他研究中國土地上的人口分布，懂得在工業與生產上着手。」胡氏又說：「他兼有科學知識與行政經騐，我們很希望在他領導下對專家的政治得到特別的注意與提高。」</p>

<p>〔中央社華盛頓廿四日合衆電〕此間官方及外交界人士，對於蔣總統之任命翁文灝爲行政院畏反響至爲良好。彼等咸認爲翁氏倘獲有充分之權力，則定能勝任愉快，而對中國作甚大貢獻。官方人士咸悉彼思想自由，旅華或在華服務與翁氏相識之甚多美國及其他國家官員，對彼均有最佳印象。咸認爲翁氏不但忠於國家，且熟諳外國語言，與其他國家代表頗能相處。外交人士則認爲翁文灝對於工程及經濟情形至爲熟諳，蔣總統所以遴選其爲行政院長者，蓋一部份由於認爲渠具有資格，足以與美國對華援助計對合作。</p>
<p>〔聯合社南京廿五日電〕新任行政院長翁文灝，殆爲世界各國總理中最矮小之一人，長億五呎，體育祇九十磅，但其精力過人，可每日治事十五小時不倦，一部份由於血壓低至九十度，一部份由於其生活簡單，蔣德統此次選擇翁氏出長政院，乃因其具有卓越之行政才能，十六年來，使全國資源委員會由草創而發展爲一強有力之機關，雇員人數達卅萬，控制全國鋼鐵生產百分之九十八，煤斤生產百分之卅五，電力生產百分之六十五，重要金屬如錦鐵等，則達百分之一百。翁之記憶力甚強，能隨意想起某讀某廠之生產噸位。爲人沉靜，超然，不喜熱鬧，但喜與少數人聚談。翁氏在職務上洽事謹嚴，不喜舞文弄墨，但以效能爲主，且不願人藉口推諉。</p>

<p>〔中央社紐約廿四日電〕我出席聯合國安理代表蔣廷黻，告此間美國後備軍官稱：中國政府刻在採取具體步驟，實行土地改革，俾改善中國農民生活標準。以一九一七年之俄國與一九四八年之中國兩相比較，蔣氏稱：此二國均擁有大量之無知識窮苦人民，彼等主要關心者爲窮困與飢餓，彼等需要麵包之迫切，遠在彼等需要自由之上。就兩國間土地改革之異點，蔣氏繼稱：俄國當時有大地主，大產業均爲貴族所擁有，但目前中國則僅有擁有小產業之小地主，故土地擁有權，在中國並不像前在俄國可作爲革命之對象。蔣民繼稱：中國共產黨所實行之土地改革，甚難行通，蓋所分配之地畝，甚屬微小，故農民受惠甚微。蔣氏指出美國報張雜誌上所登載關於中國之消息，多係聳人聽聞者，而幾非對中國之成就及失敗處作一公正之報導。中國最大成就之一，當爲在中國政府領導下，外國治外法權在中國境內之廢除，此一步驟，已實現所有中國人之期望與志向。聽衆對中國問題，咸感興趣，曾當塲提出若千問題，計爲：（一）中國通貨膨脹，將如何予以遏止？（二）剷除共產黨威脅之趨勢如何？（三）中國工業化前途又如何？蔣氏對上述每一問題，均以堅決熱誠之態度，予以答覆，羣衆報以熱烈鼓掌。蔣氏之中心理論，爲解決中國多種問題之最佳方法，厥自經濟方而入手，美國實不應以爲中國進步遲慢而致有所不耐，蓋一國之問題，實與另一國之問題迥然不同也。</p>

<h3 id="c25">美蘇外交之前途 <a href="#c25" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e25" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">25</a></h3>
<p>— 王成組</p>
<p>自從蘇聯了表美國駐蘇大使史密斯與蘇外長莫洛托夫的換文以來，各國的反應，初而　　，鐺以失　，短短的幾天之內，巳經變化多端。交際上當轉的國際局勢，決來　　　　之間一變而為使我們宜於樂觀，也未必就是一成不變的使我們只能悲觀。個人之間發生意見，尚且難以立刻業據修好，何况是在國際舞台上爭羈的兩大強權？然而國際間的「冷戰」，也不至於像個人間的暗鬥一樣，輕易會演成全武行。</p>
<p>一般的反惠，這一次執烈贊許蘇聯當局的愛好和平的表示，而異常苛責美國當局保持現行外交政策，拒絕兩國直接談判的聲明，足見大家對於戰後的眞正和平，渴望得異常殷切。但是我們必須瞭解，在蘇聯的愛好和平的表示沒有在行動方面具體證實之前，美國的現行政策自然不能極易動搖，正因爲美國的政體與蘇聯的政體根本不同。實際上蘇聯的政策，在這一次的換文之後，何嘗不是依然保持着原來，　　，曾運的是在乎他們並不需要對於這一點另行聲明。</p>
<p>美國的拒絕繼續直接談判，決不是不願意進行合作，否則何必有以前的換文？馬歇爾所聲明的恐怕兩國直接談判徒然耗費時日，躭誤時機，確是一種值得原諒的理由。正像英外相貝文所指出的，蘇聯突然經由塔斯社把兩國換文宣佈，巳經違背外交上的似例，而是一種獵取世界同情的手段。然而美國並不是忽而向蘇聯要求彼此重行坦白商討國際爭端，忽而又拒絕商討，美國所拒絕的只是以業蘇兩國爲限的交涉方式。蘇聯是否主張要先由兩國繼續交涉，似乎也沒有正式表示過。　　　　由　蘇兩國在會議室裏面決定世界的命運，正盤在戰塲上一樣，不容易得到效果。現今的爭執，根本上並非限於兩國自身的利益，而牽涉許多其他國家。如果美國毅然舉蘇聯鎚行單獨交涉，而蘇聯也竟然同意，恐怕現今在諷諷美國沒有勇氣的批評家，早已羣起反對他們私相授受，以他國的利益為孤注。我們旣不贊成雅爾還會議的重見於今日，何必又責雖美國首爾兩端？</p>
<p>然而美國當局這一種的聲明，並不關閉國際局勢轉變的門戶。聯合國的各種會議以及外長會議，儘　雙方表示妥協合作的機會。非但蘇聯，任何一國愛好和平的表示，唯有在這些場合能有具體的表現。國際局勢的劍拔緊張，由原子彈問題以至於柏林的交通管制，都是那些會議失敗所種的惡果。因此前途的重要關鍵之一，還是這些會議的順利進行。</p>
<p>在美蘇兩國換文之後，最近的有關蘇聯的重要消息，是將要更動駐聯合國會議的代表葛羅米柯的職務，而以罵立克承繼。不論葛氏將如何升調，在此時另換新人接替，很可能是蘇聯政策確有改絃易轍的準備的進一步表示。在新代表的言動趨向未證實之前，我們對於這一種的人事更動，不宜貿然寄予過高的期望。但是今後的趨向，在短時期內應當可以稍露形跡。</p>
<p>需要陸續舉行的國際會議，還有好幾種。為着確定戰敗各國今後的地位與戰勝各國對於他們的權益，已經成立的只有對意和的較爲重要，也還剩不許多問題，例如意國舊屬地的處置，特里雅斯脫港共管新體例的建立或修改。對奧和約曾經草擬而未完成。對於結東第二次世界大戰最關重要的對德對日兩和約的會議，更是諸多廷攔，茫無頭緒。這些都是在羅緬保芬諸約成立之後，蘇聯態度更其強硬，英美等國不　再行讓步，以至久懸不決的要案。此外像多惱河航權會議之類，範圍較爲狹小，却是牽涉的問題也相當複雜。</p>
<p>在每一次大戰之後，交戰勝利的各國，因分贓不勻而發生爭執，本是當事。參加戰爭之目標，根本上就不是單純的羈着自衛，凡是力之所及，總希望着能有新的收穫增強自身的地位，以免重蹈遭受侵犯的覆轍。蘇聯竭力擴充在東歐各國的控制權，不肯放鬆捷克，拒絕退出旅大，加強北韓的佔領，是以保障安全為藉口。美國的努力促進西歐各國的復興與團結，援助希土等國的設施，也是以保障和平爲理由。不過美蘇兩國由於政治社會體制的根本不同，彼此更多一種深刻的猜忌。蘇聯可以體資美國有包圍她的陰謀，美國也可以譴責蘇聯有破壤她的市塲與爐動工潮等的陰謀。</p>
<p>這一次大戰的結局更有一種特點，是戰敗國己經被戰勝國分區佔領。因此對於戒備戰敗國的重新成爲破壞世界和平的勢力，已經不成其爲戰勝國共同協力的目標。戰勝國之間反而增加許多猜疑，對於搬得動的工廠設備之類，遷動數量不盡公開；對於搬不動的資源，運用方式互相攻計。甚至蘇聯疑慮美國扶植日本的工商業，別有野心；而美國也疑虜蘇聯將要利用共黨組織，控制德國全境。在這一種空前的新局面之下，勝利國之問，自然一變而爲以自相傾軋，代替協力制數。</p>
<p>然而在這一種緊張的局面之下，如果就認爲第三次世界大戰竟會一觸即發，未免過慮。現代國際關係廣戰爭工具的進步，旣已使得大戰的世界性愈趨擴大，第三次世界大戰誠然難免終於爆發，却是決不會就在第二次大發的之後的　　未復的呈期。雖然蘇聯在　　大　　使之　　　　　　　　　上　　　持着最強犬的陸軍，美國在復員完成之後重又擴充軍備，都不足以作為開發的預兆，她們無非是要借重武力來爭強外交上的力量。</p>
<p>我們相信美蘇兩國都　還是渴望着和平，不過任何一方面都不願意輕易讓步。蘇聯旣已獲得控制東歐各國的優勢，以各地物資的供求情形而論，採取孤立政策，決不能支持長久。美國以大量物資籠絡東西各國，而同時處處防範蘇聯的行動，也不能支持長久。後者的當局，爲着爭取國內民衆的擁護，尤其需要和平的保證。因此最近兩國的換文，與蘇聯駐聯合國代表調動之後，兩國的外交立塲，漸趨轉變，以便進行上述各種重要會議，是很有可能的發展。如果這些會議能在相當和洽的情緒之下獲得較爲妥善的決策，國際關係也就可以重見安定。這一種轉帝，在短時期之內就有具體的表現，看來很有可能。</p>
<p>至於美蘇兩國僵局打開的方式，並不一定須要兩國首領會晤，最方便的是外長會議的復會。美國援助西歐復興的計劃，實際上不至於因美蘇關係的改善而動搖，但是勢必推廣到東歐。援助希土兩國以及中國的方案，也不至於全部動搖，但是勢必修改。美蘇的世界和平，未必就能跟着實現，然而我們總希望由於美蘇僵局的打開，世界和平的來臨可以更近一程。</p>

<p>— 杜韋明</p>
<p>太平洋上的風雲，燃起了遠征緬甸的炸火，我中華健兒，以英勇姿態，出現於從未經歷的變荒戰場，國軍仗義伸援，與盟軍駢肩作戰，這可以說是有史以來的一們壯舉！戴安瀾將軍，率領著陸軍第二百師，作國軍的先鋒，首先開關這遠征的途徑，發揮了能攻能守的戰續，使十萬遠征軍得著安全而有力的掩護，深入異國，以達到戰略上最大的目的，解除了盟軍的危機，也可以說是我們陸軍抗戰期間，在一切困難條件下，所完成戰史上最輝煌的一頁！可是不幸，他於轉戰期間，却因突敵重圍而負傷，而殉國。時光似風馳電閃般的迅速，轉瞬已到了戴將軍殉國六週年的紀念日，使我們於紀念他的今天，低徊前塵往事，有無限悲涼沈痛之感！</p>
<p>戴安瀾將軍的壯烈殉國，是民國三十一年五月二十六日。他在遠征期問，曾經固守同古，馳援巧克巴塘，攻克棠吉。正在準備參德勒會戰的時候，不料英軍突然自動撤退，左翼的後路又被　斷，將軍奉命轉進，星夜急馳，原擬先入國境守備，而經過的地區，都是祟山峻嶺，變荒之區，旣無人煙，也沒有食糧，凡屬公路河流山隘要道，都爲日寇先期扼守，將軍奮不顧身，負傷力戰，全師萬衆一心，誓滅倭寇，先後突破了五道重關，完成了全師而返的使命，但他却在緬甸的毛邦村，因傷重不治而逝世。當我聽到他殉國的噩耗，正在緬北亙古無人的野人山麓側敵行軍，一面與敵人奮鬥，一面受變烟瘴雨的侵襲，雖然沒有遇到大敵和猛獸毒蛇的侵襲，而在原始森林內，却有不可勝數的蟻蚊螞蝗，足以殺人，眼看著成千累萬的將士，因爲飢餓的掙扎，惡瘧的傳染，螞蝗的吮血，更有蠅蚋螞蟻的攢集咕嘬，使英勇的將士束手無策，甚至一經倒地，在幾小時以內，受了這些小昆虫的吮吸，就會變成枯骨，此種慘酷的情景，簡直無法形容，想到將軍負傷前後的歷境，正同這是一樣，眞是慘絕人寰，欲哭無淚，兼以在荒山幽谷原始森林露營，絕無招魂設祭的可能，更使人欺疚於懷，無以自解！</p>
<p>我和戰將軍共事最久，相知最深，他有著雄偉的儀表，和剛毅的個性，他的態度似乎孤傲而不受繫羈，但他內心，却是極度敏感而熟情奔放，在他與我相處的過程中，我認爲他是一個相互攻錯的益友，也是一個可共患難的戰友。遠在我們軍校同事的時候，那時還都是少年，他那脾睨羣倫的氣槪，和精明幹練的才華巳竟在我腦際留下很深刻的印象，覺得他是一個不平凡的人才，有時抵掌談論上下古今，他對於人物很少許可，不過他却有負責知恥和不避勞怨的風格，現出他那任重致遠的志向。軍校以後，我們各自踏上了征途，他在豫皖剿匪，長城抗日，和抗戰初期，台兒莊會戰等役，都表現了驚人的成績。當調他到二百師來的時候，老友相見，歡若平生，在我旣有繼往得人之變，而戴將軍亦以重得共事爲喜，彼此更增加了勇往前進的精神，和殺敵報國的信念。直到後來看到他出師緬甸的詩一揚鞭遙指花如許，諸葛前身今又來」，纔知道這才氣奮發勇於事功的人，竟是諸葛武侯的崇拜者，但是他的遭際，也正同於諸葛武侯，而使人有出師未捷身先死，長使英雄淚滿襟之慨了！</p>
<p>戴將軍的治軍嚴明，訓練有方，他能够實踐委員長「技高阻大」的訓示，精研典則，且戰且教，使二百師上下輯睦，萬衆一心，技術嫻熟，官乒一體，不但軍委會校閱認爲全國第一，而在崑崙關的會戰，尤其表現其訓練的成就，開抗戰以來轉守爲攻的先例，收攻堅克險聚殲頑敵的效果。在緬甸戰塲上冒署遠征，他在東湯西馳，轉戰數月，攻必克，守必固，力行任務，不辭艱險，更發揮了他軍事上的天才，表現了他軍人的武德，這不是將在「阿其所好」，凡是熟習我軍戰績的人，大約都有同感。將軍殉國的時期，年僅三十八歲，旣未睹抗戰的勝利，又未竟建國的偉業，實使我們在欽敬之餘，有不盡的悼惜。而我和將軍十餘年相處，水乳交融，情同手足，而竟中途折傷，這是一個如何的創痛。再環顧今日，中原鼎沸，戰亂正急，「聞擊鼓而思將帥」，對於將軍的早逝，更覺是國家一個無可補償的損失。民族的英雄已竟隨着時代巨輪而俱逝，在悼念逝者，顧念將來，固然不勝其蒼茫獨立之感，然而戴將軍的忠勇綱績，亭峙河山，昭垂日月，其光芒焜耀，爍古震今，更足以堅定我們的信心，和鼓勵我們的勇氣，我們以汗與徊繼續戴將軍的步伐，進而完成戡亂建國的使命。</p>

<p>〔合衆社社爾　基廿四日電〕芬蘭各地工人廿四日舉行罷工，以抗議政府府　　共黨內長萊諾。共黨此種虎術，與三月前捷克政變中所採取者完全相同。當芬蘭首都震懾於共黨戰術之發動下，芬內閣舉行緊急會議，情勢之嚴重爲空前未有，且有演變爲共黨全力企圖攫取政權及迫使芬蘭加人蘇聯「鐵幕」集團之虞。</p>

<p>人民民主黨巳於今日令全國該黨黨員發動罷工，以爲廿五日總罷工之先聲。海爾辛基碼頭工人怠工後，已使原定今晨出口之船舶卅四艘無法出口，其他各港亦受同樣影響。同時社民黨佔有多數優勢之「工聯協會」，則以一六二對一四一票通過一項決議案，宣布今日發生之罷工，爲不顧工會職權，意在引起政治動亂，顯與民主程序有背。行動委會之組織，係於今日經人民民主黨主席柯洛宣布。該黨機關報『伐巴薩那報』謂巴錫基之拒絕恢復萊諾之職，係襲用捷克反動派之方法。萊諾本人今日在三萬人出席之人民民主黨大會由致辭，謂渠之被免職以及因此而引起之事件，乃反動派攻擊民主的結果，渠堅決要求以人民民主黨負担任內長之職。在場聽衆即大呼要求萊諾之復職，並聲言不惜以武力達到此一目的。最近消息，謂社民黨正在各工廠商店施用壓力，使工人復工。</p>

<p>〔美國新聞處華盛頓電〕三月三十日參院外交委會發表已修正　華報告，其摘要如下：</p>
<p>整　亞之前途，與中國之發展具有密切之關係。</p>
<p>由於我兩國民族傳統之友誼，中國之困難引起美國深切之同情，尤其在此緊急關頭，中國爲反共陣綫之重要部份。</p>
<p>有若于　利之因素。中國在糧食與原料方面，尚能自給自足。中國擁有廣大而有價值之勞工實力。在政治意識濃厚之人民中，有贊成民主政府之強烈情緒。對於文明之建設價值，具有偉大之成績與尊重。</p>
<p>在另一方面，中國之經濟，巳因八年對日抗戰及勝利後之內戰而大受損害，內戰中又包括共黨　用之破壞戰術。中國從未展開一有利之貿易均勢，而在過去數年內，不利之貿易均勢，顯然每况愈下。中國面臨極困難與極複雜之任務，而美國之合作地位不易確定。但目前之建議，顯然由當前各種事實證明爲合理，而國民政府所提之自助建議（見第十八節），值得吾人之合作。</p>
<p>（甲）政治環境</p>
<p>自一九二八年以來，國民政府向由國民黨控制。該黨已採取初步步驟，宣佈憲法與選舉國民大會，向民主之途前進。同時，中國共產黨之目標，則以極權政府爲對象。中共之穴傳竭力反美，不顧美國之一切政策，而遵循莫斯科之路綫。中國目下似有社會與政治因素及理想存在之希望，此等因素與理想，能擴大及增加國民政府之政治吸引力與領袖資格，藉以向公然叛變之共產黨作戰。</p>
<p>在一九四五年八月之中蘇條約中，蘇聯自承僅支持國民政府，該政府由各國承認爲中國之合法政府。蘇聯並未以該條約所規定之「物質資源」援助國民政府。反之，蘇聯將大批工業設備，由東北各工廠中搬走，其價值恐達二十億美元之鉅。（見附録C）</p>
<p>（乙）經濟危機</p>
<p>自日本戰敗以來，中國之經濟巳漸趨惡化。交通之破壞，已使物資與消耗中心及各口岸隔離。來年糧食缺乏二百萬噸，大半出於內戰之結果。內戰之費用，使政府之支細日高，通貨膨脹之奔跑，阻礙生產與分配，並刺激投積與囤積。發行之紙幣較一九四七年增加八倍以上，在三月中旬美金在黑市之價值每年約合法幣四十五萬元，政府之支出百分之七十用於軍事方面，稅收不到政府全部支出三分之一。　中國私人所有之黄金，外匯與各國外幣，約合五億美元，但中國政府感覺極難動用此等資源。海外華人之僑匯大見减少，中國官方之外匯存底日形枯竭，以致不久將無力購買基本平民經濟所必需之輸入品。</p>
<p>有價值之資源，如煤斤及農村區之糧食一點，在共黨控制之下，中共所宣佈之目標，爲造成中國之經濟崩潰。</p>
<p>（丙）中共控制下之人口與地區</p>
<p>據約略之估計，至一九四八年三月十五日爲止，中共所控制之區域佔全中國百分之廿五，所控制之人口佔全中國百分之卅三，約一億五千萬人，</p>
<p>因軍事作戰之流動性質，及中國政府與中，共控制區之時時變動，故無法提出精確之估計。中共武裝部隊之實力估計如下：正規軍一百十五萬人，地方民團二百萬人。大約六個月以前，中國政府公開宣佈其武裝部隊之實力爲三百八十萬人。</p>
<p>以前之援華</p>
<p>國務院向委員會提出以前援華之估計如下：</p>
<p>自一九三七年以來，美國對華之經濟，財政與軍事援助如下：</p>
<p>對日勝利日以前</p>
<p>進出口銀行貸款一億二千萬美元，一九四二年國會貸款五億美元，租借物資八億四千九百四十萬美元，共十四億六千九百四十萬美元。</p>
<p>對日勝利日以後：（租借）軍事七億二千八百萬美元，民用物資貸款四千九百六十萬美元，海軍援助一千七百七十萬美元，（剩餘物資貸款）國外淸算專員辦事處船塢貸款四百萬美元，華西貸款二千萬美元，海事委員會貸款核准一千六百五十萬美元，進出口銀行貸款八千二百八十萬美元。（聯總）美國捐款百分之七十二運用於援華者，（另外運費及保險費）四億六千五百八十萬美元，捐助聯總保管委員會之物資與基金四百七十萬美元，美國對外救濟計劃四千五百七十萬美元，聯合國國際兒童緊急基金二百十萬美元，共十四億三千六百九十萬美元，總計二十九億零六百三十萬美元。</p>
<p>由於若干剩餘物資之出售，並不包括於上述總額中之故，國務院復　其二月十九日致主席之書函中，以下列補充數字提供予委員會：</p>
<p>國務院力言欲求結出剩餘物資交易之總額，實不可能，因在若干方面，餘物品仍在移交之中，而在此種移交工作完成之　，該項物資之全部價值無法確知，職是之故　上述數字，在若干方面僅屬估計性質。</p>
<p>委員會同意此種援助情形，再度證實美國對中國利之基本的與傳統的關切。（未完）</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕楊樹浦定海路平凉路口，昨晚七時半，發生榮軍與警察衝突事件，一時形勢嚴重，附近居民鮑受虛驚，當塲有楊樹浦警察分局警士三人，保警中隊警員五人，及路過該處之海軍士兵一人受傷，同時保警中隊部門窗　椅等亦被搗毀，事後更查悉保警有步槍四支手槍一支·於泥亂中遺失，警局崗警兩人失蹤。此不幸事件之起因，實由於四傷兵於問路時，不滿警士所答，引起衝突。後有　州路第二十傷兵醫院熒軍二百餘人到來，將保警中隊部加以搗毀，以致造成軒然大波。至善後問題，巳連夜由警備部派少校周副官，憲兵隊王連長，聯勤供應局葉秋審，保警中隊王中隊長，傷兵醫院丁訓導員，及楊樹浦警分局長王渭周，副分高長　　標，會商處理辦法中。</p>
<p>事緣有榮軍王鳳鳴者於昨日下午六時許，在大中華飯店晚飯後，徵有洒意，路經定海路建國大戯院時，乘興入內觀劇，適遇同伴羅金堂·紀德昌·韓昌德三人，稍坐離座，四人擬相偕同返眉州路第二十傷兵醫院，當行至定海路平凉路口，途遇警員張清濤，詢問何處可搭電車前往眉州路·張答以因非崗亭警士·故不知其詳。榮軍以所問不得要領，誤爲有意刁難，初則言語間發生衝突，繼即以手特之鐵杖將張淌濤毆打，時有附近警亭中李鈞·趙子英兩警員，目睹此情，出而調解，但亦爲榮軍所襲擊，李之左額角當被擊裂一寸餘長，受創倒地，趙則　部受傷。時路人圍觀者甚衆，成抱不平，乃協助警員將肇事榮軍四人帶往楊樹浦警局。不料此時第二十傷乒醫院得悉有榮軍四人被扣警局，乃糾集榮軍二百餘人，集國出發擬加營救，當十隊浩浩蕩蕩，行經平涼路寧武路保警第二總隊第一大隊第一中隊部　，榮軍誤爲警局派出所，乃即蜂涌衝入，門崗李國美首當其衝，先被打傷，保警以事出意外，尚不知禍從何來。不旋踵間，門窗桌椅早己搗毀無遺。分隊長周桂勝爲避免事態擴大，當即一面禁止警士開槍，一面則出外擬向熒軍詢問原由，但在混亂中與警士賈洪紀·王志高·姚杰三人同遭毆傷。至斯，榮軍乃一哄而散。臨行時復將周賈王三人一併架走。事後保警整理內部，始又發現短少步槍四枝及手槍一枝，同時楊樹浦警局方面亦於熒軍返歸醫院後，發覺寗國路崗警呂浩及眉州路派出所門崗卡金康兩人同告失蹤。此外尚有一不幸者，遭遇誤傷，當熒軍滋事時，有海軍士兵蔣勇忠途經該處，因身穿黃色制服，亦被榮軍誤為警員，頭胸均遭毆傷。以上受傷者均經送入警察醫院醫療，惟警員李鈞傷勢甚重，有性命之憂。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕記者爲明瞭本市財政收支情形，昨特趨訪市財政局　局長，承告：自四月份起，公務員生活指數，自每季調整，改爲逐月調整，支出遂驟形增加，五月份支出總額約六千三百億元，惟近月來，已就各項可征之稅，加緊征收，故五月難關，亦勉可渡過，惟六月份之收支，則恐無法平衡，唯一之補救辦法，勢將同有關金融機構，告貸彌補。</p>
<p>處茲艱困之局面下，惟有一方面督促加速征收應征之各稅，例如佔稅收總額百分之四十之營業稅，屬於春季者，已收足十之七八。另方面，整飭稅收，擬試簡化稽征辦法。現有稽征辦法，須經商戶申報營業額稅，局複查後塡發繳款書，商戶憑以繳稅。時間，手續，人力，無法避免浪費。簡化辦法，在先確定全市七萬餘稽征對象一季之標準營業額，即以此爲基數，以後各季，即按各季物價昇降比率，計算其應繳之稅額，母勞由報複查等手續。標準營業額之確定，將由財局參考各商戶過去之申報額，分定各業之總營業額後，再由各業公會，負責分定所屬會員商戶逐戶之營業額，編製分戶基數表送局，財局即以此爲稽征各季營業稅額之依據。該項簡化稽征原則，曾一度由市府，財局，市參議會，市商會四機構所組之小組審查會，研討一過，二次小組會召開在即，會後當有若干結論。簡化稽征後，相信確能整飭稅收，惟仍採試辦性質，各業對新辦法不滿意者，仍可就原有稽征辦法，申報納稅云。</p>

<p>〔本報特寫〕江產路警察分局後面，有一所「狗牢」，裏面囚狗一百餘隻，都是警察局捕犬隊在馬路上捉來的，等待着失主認領，無照的野狗，則一律以煤氣處死。</p>
<p>記者昨往「狗牢」作一番巡視，一間陰暗，潮濕，骯體，狹窄的小房間裏，關了一百多條狗，一踏進牢門，就有一股具氣，那些狗被裝在畏方形的鐵絲籠裏，看見有人進去，便狂吠一陣。許多失主往往可以憑着呌聲，很快地辨認自己的愛犬。</p>
<p>監獄裏的狗，每天可以吃到一頓牛肉薄粥，「狗牢」當局每天買一一十萬元鐵牛肉，燒成兩大鍋薄粥，於上午九時，供各犬分食。下午四時再供給自來水一次，籠中狗因爲營養不　，大都骨瘦如豺。好在家犬於短期內必由。主領回，而野犬反正遲早難免一死。</p>
<p>標賣狗皮貼補伙食　一雙狗在捉到以後，有照會的飼養七天，無照會的飼養四天，限期以內無人往領的，便視作野犬，處死或者送人。野犬處死的刑塲，是個畏約五尺、　約二尺的鐵箱，每次可容狗十餘隻，內裝有煤氣管，三分鐘內可以處死·狗於中煤毒後，全身發黑·其肉絕對不能取食，但是狗皮却可賣錢，每張狗皮的價格，約合食米升餘，狗皮收入用來貼補捕大隊員的伙食費。</p>
<p>「狗牢」中有工作人員二十名，負責人是張鏡，捕犬隊計四組，每組四人，每天必全體出動，平均每天可捕犬四五十隻。此外尚有內勤二人，是專門負責「狗牢」淸潔工作的，「狗牢」每天必須洗刷兩次，並澆以大量臭藥水，否則簡直無法入內。</p>
<p>頭錯眼花俯首就縛　捕犬領隊王金友，捕犬已有四十餘年歷史了。他對記者發表经驗談：「捕犬最好提住牠的後腿，然後把狗拾起來，使勁地讓牠轉圈子，這樣牠就頭昏眼花，俯首就縛了。」據告他們捕犬都用手，有時候稍不小心就會被咬的危險，數十年來，且就　　了，簡直就不當一同事，他伸手給記者看，手上傷痕斑斑，他說迪一二天就自己會好的，可是就怕瘋狗，瘋狗咬了就必須去打針。</p>
<p>具有一份菩薩心腸</p>
<p>捕犬在他們，早已成為家常便飯了，然而捕犬者却具有一份菩薩慈悲心腸。他們希望每條狗都能有牠的生路。現時失主前往認領的，每天必有二三十人。同時有許多醫院寫信向他們索狗作爲試驗之用，如巴士德研究院，東南警學院，及聖約翰學院等，每星期約需狗十雙。此外，到「狗牢」討狗的人也不少，凡是過了期無人認領的野犬，他們願意無條件地送人。他們說：「爲野犬找一條活路，就等於做好事。非到最徒關頭（那就是野犬太多，狗牢客納不下了），決不利用煤氣。」</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕連日米價暴漲原因，據有關當局分析係受產地高漲，農忙，湖南水災現象，內閣改組等影響。本市門售價經吳市長嚴限不得過六百萬元普每日在市場拋售六千石後，前昨二日巳稍回落。昨無錫等地亦巳回跌至六百一二十萬，加以湖南湖水水位已開始低落，人心安定，待新內閣正式成立後，一般觀察，更可回小。</p>
<p>本市計口配米價格，按中美協定須按上月份最後五天之平均市價，九五折計算。本月份米價暴漲劇烈，如按此一公式計算，則六月份配米價格必較五月份之每石三百五十萬元上漲甚多，刺激市場，必將浩成嚴重後果。當局對此已予密切注教，正與美方中美救濟團洽商中。</p>
<p>昨日米市在當局嚴厲執行限價及及調會繼續拋售下，場外價格巳開始回跌。業外各物一致報疲，貨主心軟，脫意頓濃。且因格於限價，出路不易，問津寥寥，自粳薄稻初喊六百五十萬，旋以銷淡，更退爲六百四十萬元，早稻六百三十萬，各降三十及三十五萬元，交易殊稀。昨日拋米數量仍爲六千石，二市到貨登記三千八百三十四石。</p>

<p>前任中央銀行總裁張嘉璈氏，昨午於私邸設宴招待外匯基金平衡委員會主委陳光甫，委員沈熙瑞孔士諤及新兼央行總裁兪鴻鈞副總裁劉攻芸氏。席間陳沈兩氏曾就張嘉璈氏擔任總裁期間之外匯收支及年來進出口貿易情形，向俞鴻鈞氏提出報告。兪氏對陳沈兩氏之請辭一點，亦表示堅決挽留。兪氏幷認爲目前一切，因政府改組尚未完成，嚴格而論，均屬過渡性質。外匯基金平衡委會之存廢，亦有待新閣成立後，始能確定。故對兩氏之辭職要求，表示堅決挽留。據一般觀測，陳光甫氏如辭去平衡會主委，則此一工作可能再由兪氏兼理，或由央行兩副總裁中之一兼任。沈熙瑞氏業務局長一職，則暫時不致更動。至撤銷外匯基金平衡委會一點，外間雖有傳說，惟在政府改組完成前，此說未免過早。但兪氏今後對外匯之管制政策，在細節上將有部份變更，殆已無問題。蓋兪氏於前日之記者招待會中，已公開表示，此一問題，將視事實需要、隨時改進云。</p>

<p>英海軍首仗之敗，列爲可惜，蓋一路領先，而受挫於臨了數分鐘，勝負非戰之罪也。全隊技術雖未見十分純熟，然身高力大，脚頭堅强，有目共賞。中堅薛格恩，門將魏格詩，均稱穩健，中鋒莫利　異常剽悍，威脅力强大，東華不可不防。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕此次雲南省全運代表隊，僅女籃球隊一隊參加，且經過甚多困難，初因　教廳經費無着，遲遲未能選拔代表，故意延宕至臨近會期，方宣佈不擬參加。水眞隊乃自行募集經費，趕飛來滬，而大會註册期已於前一日截止，絕無通融，致未克參加歸標賽。千里迢迢虛此一行，其情頗使這班女孩子難堪。抵滬後，先住運動塲內東亞體專女生宿舍，全體隊員席地蜷臥於一小角落，大會閉幕後，即要遷讓，幸得同鄉介紹，搬至泰興路婦女數養院居住，形同難民。該隊隊員均爲昆市教員，此番來滬，假期將滿，且經費行將用罄，急欲賦歸，但最近滬昆班機客位，均巳留待國大代表搭乘，普通旅客，至早亦須於下月八日至十五，始可載搭，在此空閒時間，水眞甚希能與留滬各球隊作友誼賽數塲，互相觀摩請益。但最使雲南姑娘們難受的，英雌無用武之地，竟找不到打球的對象。水眞隊此次在滬，共作過友誼賽四塲，首對湖北代表隊，次對南京代表隊·第三次對上海女籃勁旅前綫隊，前日仁餘對天津賽前一塲，本約定全運女籃冠軍緣隊比賽，結果緣隊因隊只需要休息，臨時拉了民立女中替代。水眞雖然每戰皆捷，但她們不敢自滿，一般認爲邊疆隊，能有如此身手，洵爲難能可貴，她們最希望能與她們久巳欽仰的綠隊比賽一塲，無論勝負總想在球藝上得到更多的經驗。但綠隊遲遲不肯答應，也許在她們的意思，假如比賽勝利，固然應該，失敗則恐爲盛名之累。其他如菲列濱·福建·印尼等，亦不肯屈就。此次水眞隊來滬，該隊之不顧一切困難，如此毅力精神，均極可佩，希望錄隊以及留滬勁旅，能本體育一家爲運動而運動的精神，給予她們同情，給與她們難得的比賽機會，我們在球迷立塲，也極希望早日能欣賞到精采的會戰。本報駐英記者</p>
<h3 id="c136">倫敦政經學院巡禮 <a href="#c136" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e136" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">136</a></h3>
<p>— 本報駐英記者　薩本耿</p>
<p>這篇通訊的目的，在於向國人介紹一下這裏一個研究社會科學的重要學校——倫敦政治經濟學院。但是在沒有介紹這個學校以前，我想先就英國大學的若干特殊情形說一說。</p>
<p>英國的大學與中國有若干基本的歧異。第一，這裏的大學，都是私立的而沒有國立的，雖則私立大學也接受國家的經濟協助，但是究竟與國立的性質不同。第二，英國不但沒有國立大學，並且教育部並不過問大學內部的事情，大學自身成爲一個自治的法人，因此既沒有「大學法」一類的法規；經濟協助是由財政部發給，並不因協助而構成一種「干涉」。英國的「教育法」只是規定大學以外的各級各種教育的「法」。第三，所有的大學，都是逐漸發展而成的，因此，各校有各校的「傳統」，甚至於各院有各院的「傳統」，注重自身的「傳統」，而不講求劃一。雖則各校的情形，有若干相同之處，但是它的出入也很大。</p>
<p>倫敦政治經濟學院的英文原名，呌做Llindon　School　of　Economicsand　Political　Science。它是倫敦大學的若干學院之一。倫敦大學成立於一八〇〇年，目前倫敦大學包括有幾十個不同的單位。這些單位的成立時期不同，逐漸加入倫敦大學的。所以各單位的名稱，雖則在中文裏可以稱爲「學院」，而實際上，各單位的英文原名，都保留它原有的名稱，或稱College，或稱School，或稱Institnete。有的單位，雖稱學院，而其內部又分為若干學院。各學院的名稱也沒有同一的標準，有的顧名思義，一望而知其爲　何學科，例如倫敦政治經濟學院，倫敦教育學院。也有的是另有名稱，例如「國王學院」（King's　College）王后學院（Oueen'sCollege）之類。各學院的科系，可能相同的，例如倫敦政治經濟學院，國王學院，以及「大學學院」（University　College）這三院都有法律學部份。各學院並不在同一地址，倫敦大學對於若千辦法雖有統一的規定，但是也許可以說有更多的事情，各院保留其自身的「傳統」。附帶說明的，「學院」在倫敦大學，還多少帶有中國大學「學院」的性質，在牛津劍橋，學院只是宿舍或說「生活單位」，與中國大學「學院」完全異趣。</p>
<p>學校的組織，縱的方面包括大學本科與研究院兩部份。橫的方面，包括政治，經濟，社會，人類，法律等學科。但是並不像中國大學那樣的有顯著的系別。現在將它的主要內容，作一簡述，也許多少也可以由此而知英國大學之梗概。先由大學本科說起。</p>
<p>每年上課廿八星期並無學分行導師制</p>
<p>大學本科三年畢業，與其說是分系，母寗說是分爲若干種學士學位。三年之間，一共只考三次。第一次是入學考試，第二次可以說是期中考試，舉行於第一學年結束，第三次是畢業考行於第三學年結束之時。每一學年分爲三個學期，第一學期爲十月至十二月，第二學期爲正月至三月，第三學期爲四月至六月。這一種一年分爲三學期制，英國各大學相同，不過每學期的起始與結束日期，並不完全一致。大概倫敦大學各學院，一年約上課二十八星期，每學期平均約爲九星期左右。（劍橋牛津每年上課約爲二十四星期左右）是以每年假期頗多。入學的第一件事，自然是繳費，學校只收學費，（膳宿自理），每年約繳三十磅左右。學校雖有少數宿舍以及供全校師生聚餐用之膳廳，那是「另繳」的，由於宿舍少學生多，多數學生住在校外。這一點也是英國大學很普遍的情形。牛津劍橋雖有宿舍，但是因爲收費並不比校外低，所以仍有不少學生住在校外。進了學校之後，自然就是上課。上課並沒有什麼「學分」這一類的制度，每一學生都有一位導師。你打算研究什麼，該上什麼課，可以找導師請教。當然，因爲有期中考試與畢業考試的關係，各人所上的課，大致與他所考的有關。考試的課目，視你所讀的學位而定。有的必試，有的選試，所考的課目在名稱上未必與所上的課完全相同，通常是考的課目比較範圍大些，一門考的課目，有時可包括好幾門應上的課。期中考試的淘汰甚嚴，不及格者非特許即須退學。</p>

<h3 id="c137">一個兵士 <a href="#c137" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e137" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">137</a></h3>
<p>— 新疆·穆提義著　史天行譯</p>
<p>日前新疆歌舞團總幹事海比爾先生來上海，在一次談話中會經提到一位譯名穆提議的維族作家，當時我們就很想找機會讀到這位作家的著作；後來聽說穆提義先生當選了新疆出席國民大會的代表，並曾來京開會。可是南京方面究竟是政治中心，似乎很少有人注意到這位聞名蘇聯和我國邊疆的作家。</p>
<p>此次承史天行先生從蘇聯出版的世界語本「新羣衆」中譯出這篇「一個兵士」，使我們能够讀到這位國大代表，新疆作家的一篇短篇小說，眞是一件高興的事。</p>
<p>據說穆提義先生是工人出身，游歷過很多地方，本篇大概是他參加第二次大戰，從軍生活期間的作品。（編者）</p>
<p>夜幕漸漸展開了。當這兵十依上森林中的小徑，走向一片廣闊的墾地時，風雨將臨的景象，更增添了森林的黑暗可怖—他立即想起他所聽得的描幕叙述，他記得長春藤　上屋頂的房屋，便是他所要尋找的。他迅速地走過墾地；當第一滴雨，印入路上的灰塵中時，他敲起大門。門隨即開了。</p>
<p>『瑪萊先生是這裏嗎？』他詢問上。</p>
<p>『爸爸不在家，他往鎭上去了。』活潑的聲音應答上：『你如果願意會他的助理，他倒就住在附近。』</p>
<p>門階上現出一個年靑的少女，在她的身後，跟隨上一隻大狗，狺狺地呌個不休，她隨即命令牠止住了吠聲。從外表看來，她的芳齡，大概是十六七歲的光眾。在灰白的衣服裏，可以看出她的身體顯上高大且發育完全。她聰慧的臉上，猶帶上兒時的天眞。但是她的眸子，異常的端莊，安定，靜默。她用纖細的手，從眉間，理拂上黑色的蓬鬆的鬈髮</p>
<p>『我原擬和瑪萊先生晤談』。這個兵士口吃地說。</p>
<p>瞧了她一眼，他不覺畏怯起來。她驚訝地注視上他，覺得他那種顯然怕羞的神情，與他高大的體軀活潑的姿態及他豪爽磊落的風格，不相適應。</p>
<p>『如果我還能再來的話…………』他喃喃地說：『但這是不可能的，今晚我就將搭車。然而呀，僅爲了你，——唯有對你，我有一句話要說』。</p>
<p>當少女聰到最後的一句話，雨下得更大了。她於是請他走進屋內，隨後就把門關上。他們彼此存留在一間宏大而黯淡的室內</p>
<p>『我想你不見得知道，』他開始考慮上說：『我想你也許巳經得上了些消息。我原擬在令尊前詳細地告陳，可是我又不得不匆匆回去，同時我又必得遵守我的允諾。你當知道我從前綫回來。我的名字是善望弗替安，我是某君的朋友，關於某君，你是深切明瞭的。是的——而託里安。他受了傷，——沉重，異常的沉重——</p>
<p>『我的上帝』！她呼號了起來：『他不曾—請把眞實消息告我』！</p>
<p>他默默不語，他料想她必已領悟。當他注意到應該很周密而迂緩地說出時，他深悔不應該把這不幸的消息，告訴得太急迫。他預計必可見到她的臉色變白，她的面頰上懸上眼淚。出乎他意料之外，因爲在那裏並沒有一點可怕的失望的痕跡，爲他預料中所不忍目睹的。他又重複低聲說：</p>
<p>『我允諾他這些—他的所有，如紀忿品等—帶到此地來，如果他有不測的話。這些便是』。</p>
<p>他把一個黑帶捆紮上小包裹，放在介於他們中間的一張桌子上。</p>
<p>「我的上帝—我的上帝！可憐的露依斯—這是何等的不幸呵』—少女喃喃地呼號。</p>
<p>『露依斯？你不是露依斯嗎？你不是保羅的未婚妻嗎』？</p>
<p>『不，不』。她紊亂地苦痛地　上雙肩答適：『露依斯是我的姊姊。她已是二十二歲了。他們訂婚時，是在這次戰爭之前。我那時只有十四歲，可憐的露依斯—她眞愛他，那般熱烈地愛他。前幾天，她感上非常的不舒服。她好久不曾接到他的信了。她和父親到鎭上去想探得些消息』。</p>
<p>『那末你是爱彌莉了』—兵士說：「他奮和我談及你—不過在那時你還不過是一個孩子呢」！</p>
<p>「是的，我是愛彌莉」。她回答上說。</p>
<p>經渦了半晌的靜寂，他心向上小包裹，又復開始說：</p>
<p>『那是為了你的姊姊。他呌我必得把這些帶到此地，如果萬一的不幸光顧了他。他在我的身旁倒下，當塲就死了。我迅速地盡我的能力所及，遵守我的允諾。他託託里安—是我的朋友，我們相聚有數月的光陰。當他促使我發誓，允諾到此地來；他亦會伸述過當為我畫同樣的義務，如果我有不測的話。不過，對於我呢，那是亳無所得的』。</p>
<p>『為什麼呢』？愛彌莉問上，她的眼睛浮動了起來。</p>
<p>『為什麼呢』？勉强地一笑，他回答道：「因為我在這個世界上是個孤獨者—絕對的孤獨。我既無父母，又無親戚，亦無愛人—沒有一個人照顧我。總之，簡直沒有任何人給予我以情愛。你知道，雖在戰塲上，在那種時候，我都不忍說到這些。我說了許多引不起你興趣的事』。</p>
<p>她溫柔地視上，那些巳感動了她。這個兵士經過了片刻的遲疑，終於很勇敢地發出了一個問題：</p>
<p>『你可有一個愛人在戰塲上嗎？』</p>
<p>她搖上她的頭，她的脸紅得發熱。她們很安靜地站在那裏，彼此都浸浴在嬌柔的曖昧的情緒裏，他們被介在他們中間桌子上可憐的紀念物，引起了紊亂的悲痛的哀愁。兵士混亂地想到他很僥倖地從死機下遁出，同時他急切地渴望上生存與戀愛。他願望發生的對象，轉注上一個活潑的黑色頭髮的少女。但他沒有勇氣把他的思想放人語句裏，他僅僅說道：</p>
<p>『我將走了。但是在我臨走之前，我將一度徴求你的同意，你能不能允諾我關照一個同伴，當任何關於我的事發生時把我所願留下的物件帶來送給你？這也許使你感着不快？』</p>
<p>她凝視上他。她灰色的眼裏，飽含了憫憐與同情心，同時她微微噸抖地說；</p>
<p>『你會回來的——我深信你會回轉來的。』</p>
<p>他翻覆默念上領悟上她的眞意，他和諧地說。</p>
<p>『我將回到——此地嗎？』</p>
<p>她點點頭，表示允諾的意思。他握上她的手，彎過腰來，隔上介在他們問的小包裹，很不靈便地吻上她的面額。他終於在朦朧中，順上小徑，穿過森林走去了。最後他在靑翠草木中，在雨後潮濕的大地中漸漸隐沒了。</p>

<p>— 雨琴</p>
<p>『你自己聽上雨，發出那樣　瑟底哀嘆，要是別人聽上雨時，你知道他們的心裏，是否也作你那樣蕭瑟底哀嘆呢？在不同的環境中，下上相同的雨，但在不同的人羣中，却不會有相同的心情，你能够略略道出一些他們的心情来吗？』</p>
<p>「我覺得：有的人在高山古一廟中聽雨，那雨有如高齡的長老在婆心苦心的說法；有的人在江岸舟艙中聽雨，那雨有如跋踄的旅行者在述苦般的嗟嘆；有的人在紅樓夢醒時聽雨，那雨有如夢中與情人般的軟語綿綿；有的人在茅屋漏室中聽雨，那雨有如輾轉床第的病人般的刺耳呻吟；有的人在書齊文案邊聽雨，那雨有如诗朋的吟唔互答……</p>
<p>『你说在高山古廟中听雨，不是那『細雨歸鴻，孤山無限春寒』和那『幾思同靜話，夜雨坐禪牀』的情景麼？江岸舟艙中聽雨，不是那『客夢不禁蓬背雨』和那『小窗風雨碎人腸，更在孤舟枕上』的情景麼？紅樓夢醒時聽雨，不是那『聽夜雨，冷滴芭蕉，驚斷紅窗好夢』的情景麼？茅屋漏室中聽雨，不是那『長夜沾濕何由徹』的情景麼？書齐文案邊聽雨，不是那『恨剪鐙聽雨，誰伴孤吟』的情眾麼？……</p>
<p>『你一定喜歡聽花間的雨，有花而著雨，那不更好看麼？，當桃花初開，嫩紅的花瓣正呈放上無比的嬌艷，一陣小雨經過，你難道不由人面桃花而憶起『臉似桃花初經雨』的伊人麼？要是略帶日色，又時當雨漸殘餘的天氣，你想到伊人的艷美，你是會憶起『日氣含殘雨，桃花帶雨濃』的麗句來的；要是你看見花落了，瓣兒殘了，不禁想到伊人是否瘦損了，憔悴了時，因而也會想到『桃花一簇春無主，儘著風吹雨打休』的紅顏是如何的薄命！當梅子初放，黃色的梅子，被如霧的雨潤上，你難道不吟幾句：『梅子黃時雨』，『梅子黃時雨如霧』，或是『何處半黃梅子，向晚一簾風雨』來讚賞麼？『恰是梨花春帶雨』，『雨洗梨花玉有香』，這是梨花的著雨。上句是形容人的，這個人的樣兒，大可以從這句子中去玩味，下句就好像聞到梨花被雨洗後的香氣一樣。所以著雨的梨花也是很美的，但這只是『素』的美；不是桃花那樣『艷』的美；『杏花微雨濕輕綃』，『有時經雨自凄凉』，這是杏花的著雨。前句的微字和輕字，巳把雨和綃形容得很細緻，加上一個濕字，就好像看見杏花被雨打濕了一樣；後句是說在零落的雨後，杏花被打得飄散了，不免有一種凄凉之感，但這只是自傷身世的不幸的凄凉之感而已，『牡丹經雨泣殘陽』，『菊為重陽冒雨來』，『一片暈紅疑著雨』，可以君出牡丹的悲壯，菊的勇敢，海棠的婉麗』。</p>
<p>『我並不喜歡聽雨，尤其是不喜歡聽花間的雨。著雨的花固然好看，但正因為好看我才不願聽花間的雨，至於『梧桐雨』或是「芭蕉雨』，那更是聽不得的雨。『疎雨滴梧桐』，都還勉强可聽，『梧桐樹，三更雨，不道離情正苦，一葉葉，一聲聲，空階滴到明』，就聽不得了，『梧桐夜雨，幾回無寐』，更可以看出這種雨的利害，連寐也不能够，怎麼還可以去聽呢？但由此也就知道這種令人心碎的東西具有如何的威力了！</p>
<p>『難聽的是雨，最難聽的是夜雨，張玉田早就高聲說過：『第一是難聽夜雨』，所以聽雨並不是好玩的，也不是雅事，實在是痛苦的事；但外面下上雨，總不能不聽，我有我的聽，無端的淚點聽上我胸間起伏的愛泉，我胸間起伏的愛泉又聰上濛迷的雨點，我不辨甚麼是淚？其麼是雨？只覺得相混　的愛與痛苦從我底溶溶的泉心脈脈地流過……』</p>
<p>我對於雨，不能說沒有深深地愛好，但我所深深地愛好的雨，實在是孤獨的漫奏上凄淸的曲調底一把琴。在琴心裏，一片蕭瑟的琴韻時時從凄淸的曲調裏傳出來</p>

<p>— 趙景深</p>
<p>普希金紀念館</p>
<p>列寗格勒的文學館現巳屬於蘇聯科學院，那是從普希金紀念館發展出來的，改變是從這一九〇五年開始的。</p>
<p>普希金紀念館是普希金手稿的極大實庫，大部分是有名的奧尼金（A．F．Onegin）和詩人自己的圖書館裏所採集到的，後者的材料由詩人的兒子A．Pushkin在一九〇六年供給。</p>
<p>普希金紀念館除普希金自己的手稿和著作以外，也開始搜集別的俄國詩人，作家和名人的手稿與文學資料。</p>
<p>在十月革命以後普希金紀念館從文學館的檔案保存所的形式變而為科學院的文學館，已成為蘇聯文學研討的中心。</p>
<p>現在這學術機關已有好幾個文學研討的部門：舊俄文學·新俄文學·西方文學·民俗學和民俗的文件·圖片·錄音片·模型等等。科學院的普希金·高爾基·布洛克等委員會都屬於這個文學館的權限以內。</p>
<p>手　的部門已達五十萬頁，可說是蘇聯最重要的手稿收藏。還有一個文學博物館的部門，主要的結集約計五萬點。這些寢堂裏有俄國大作家生活與作品的永久麼暨。諸如普希金最後的住所，所謂普希金博物館（莫衣卡街十二號），尼克拉莎夫的紀念博物館·米海羅夫斯柯伊（Mikhailovskoye）村的普希金的紀念公園等，都歸文學館管轄。文學館所藏的文學專書約三十萬冊。</p>
<p>現在文學館主要的工作就是出版一部「俄國文學史」，共十卷，從古代敘到文學革命。一九三五年館畏是高爾基。編纂部著名的學者有坡倫斯基（P．Lebedev-Ｐolyansky）·阿爾羅夫（A．Orlov）·梭羅訶夫（M．Sholokhov）等，他們都是科學院的院士。這部豐富的文學史第一二三五卷已出版，第六八兩卷正在印刷中</p>
<p>另外一個學者的主要工作就是四卷本的「俄國文學批評史」在戰時（一九四三）開始，這部書從十八世紀叙到十月革命。第一卷「十八世紀俄國文學批評的誕生一已經寫好，約計今年年底以前可以全部脫稿。</p>
<p>西歐文學史也在開始工作。前年「法國文學史」的上卷出版，從古代一直叙到一七八九年的革命。下卷將從一七八九年的革命叙到最近，也快要付印了。</p>
<p>「俄國民俗學」凡三卷，則由該館民俗部門主編。此外，該館還出版了許多事門諭文，談到重要的文學史問題。其中最著名的有哲學博士梅拉克（B．Mellakh）的「伊里支與十九世紀轉換期俄國文學問題」，坡倫斯基的「文學批評家的倍林斯基」，阿爾羅夫的「卡蕯克的英雄史詩，俄國古文學的英雄題林」，科學院的通信員皮里茲（V．Adrianova-Peretz）的「古俄國詩作風研究」。</p>
<p>值得嚴肅注意的是「莎士比亞作品集」的翻譯。語言學博士史麥爾諾夫（A．Smirnov）寫了一篇綸文，說莎士比亞是當時最崇高的人文思想的代表。他又分析莎士比亞的作風和技巧。最後一章是歷來各家對於莎士比亞的解釋。</p>
<p>語言學博士德爾沙文（C．Derzhavin）對於服爾太（Voltaire）的研究也是極有興趣的。</p>
<p>這機關對於文學的研討時常有定期刊物和雜誌出版，例如「普希金委員會雜誌」，「西方文學報」，「文學遺產」，「文學館手稿門報告」等。「西方文學報」的第二卷是前年出版的，其中有史麥爾諾夫的「莎士比亞的藝術」，愛力克賽夫（T．Alexeyey的「狄福與歷史小說問題」等等。</p>
<p>這個組織另一重要的工作是出版學院版本的俄國文學全集，如：普希金，哥郭爾，萊芒托夫，倍林斯基等人。</p>

<h3 id="c144">再訪梅蘭芳（下） <a href="#c144" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e144" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">144</a></h3>
<p>— 曹子愷</p>
<p>想起他晚上的販馬記，我覺得要讓他休息，不該多煩擾他了，就起身告辭。但照一個相是少不得的。我就請他，依舊到外面的空地上去。這空地也與去年一樣，不過多了一隻小山羊。這小山羊向人依依，怪可愛的。因為不邀攝影記者，由陳寶一吟自己來拍。因為不帶三脚架，不能用自動開關，只得由二人輪流司機，各人分別與伶王合攝一影。這兩個戲迷的女孩子，不能同時與伶王合攝一影，渦後她們引為憾事。在辭別出門的路上，她們絮絮叨叨的說了許多「悔不該」。〔编者按：為了想彌補這個「悔不該」，我躊躇了好久。豐先生寄給我的兩張照片，章法全同，實在無法全登，登一張又覺得不痛快，於是和本報負責製版的陸先生（豐先生的學生）商量，結果是現在刊出的一張。為Pootic　ju　tice上想，我看這樣也不要緊罷？）</p>
<p>我却耽入沈思。我這樣想:</p>
<p>我去春帶了宗教的心情而去訪梅蘭芳，覺得在無常的人生中，他的事業是戲裏戲，夢中夢；曇花一現，可惜得很！今春我帶了藝術的心情而去訪梅蘭芳，又覺得他的藝術具有最高的社會的價值，是最應該提倡的。藝術種類繁多，不下一打：繪畫，醫法，金石，彫塑，建築，工藝，音樂，舞蹈，文學，戲劇，電影，照相。這一打藝術之中最深入民間的，莫如戲劇中的平劇—山農野老，　子村童，字都不識，畫都不懂，電影都沒有看見過的，却都會哼幾聲皮簧，都懂得曹操的奸，關公的忠，三娘的貞，竇娥的冤……而出神地欣賞，熱誠地評論。足證平劇（或類似平劇的地方劇）在我國歷史悠久，根深柢固，無孔不入，故其社會的效果最高。書畫也是具有數千年歷史的古藝術，何以遠不及平劇的普遍呢？這又足證平劇不但歷史悠久，而且在其本質上具有一種吸引人情，深入人心的魔力，故能如此普遍，如此大衆化的。只可惜過去流傳的平劇，有幾齣在內容意義上不無含有毒素，例如封建思想，重男輕女，迷信鬼神等。誠能取去這種毒素，而易以增進人心健康的維他命，則平劇的社會的效能，不可限量，拿牠來治國平天下，也是容易的事。那時我們的伶王，就成為王天下的明王了！</p>
<p>前面忘記講了：我去訪梅先生的時候，還送他一把親自書畫的扇子。畫的是曼殊上人的詩句「滿山紅葉女郎樵」。寫的是弘一上人在俗時贈歌郎金娃娃的金縷曲。其詞曰：一秋到江南矣。忒匆匆，春餘夢影，樽前眉底。陶寫中年絲竹耳，走馬胭脂隊裘。怎到眼都成餘子？片玉崑山神朗期，紫櫻桃漫把紅情繫。愁萬斛，來收起。泥他粉墨登塲地。領略那英雄氣宇，秋娘情味。雛風聲淸淸幾許，銷盡填胸　氣。笑我亦布衣而已。奔走天涯無一事，問何如聲色將情寄？愁萬斛，來收起。一醫畫都是在一個精神很飽滿的淸晨用心寫成的。因為這個人對於這樣廣大普遍的藝術負有這樣鹽富的天才，又在抗戰時代表示這樣高尚的人格，——我對他眞心的敬愛，不得不「拜倒石榴裙下」。（別人譏笑我的話。）我其實應該拜倒。「名滿天下」，「婦孺皆知」（別人誇獎我的話）的　子愷，振華旅館的茶房和賬房就不認識。直到第二天梅先生到旅館來還訪了我，茶房和賬房們吃驚之下，方始紛紛去買紀念册來求我題字。（卅七年五月二十二日，梅蘭芳停演之日，作於杭州。</p>
<h3 id="c145">注意楊妹 <a href="#c145" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e145" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">145</a></h3>
<p>— 繆文瑞</p>
<p>四川楊妹九年不食的新聞，自本報連日報道以來，已引起不少讀者的好奇，有多數科學家認為荒誕無稽，不足重視，更多的讀者則以好奇的心理，視同花邊新聞以供茶餘酒後談助。但自五月十五及十六兩日本報報道楊妹不食為事實後，吾人已不能等閑視之，若干有遠識的科學家已俄然緊張起來。假使全球的人類都和楊妹一樣，終年不食，則土地改革或土地革命均將失其論據，農業農政將失其重要，大多數的農民亦將轉變其職業，政治及生活均將大大變革！</p>
<p>李之郁局長巳用科學方法證實楊妹不食爲千眞萬確之事實。據本報報道其次一步工作，將邀華西大學醫學院院長研究其新陳代謝。任何生物皆有新陳代謝，無此作用便無生命，楊妹既能生活，必有新陳代謝無疑，不過其性質與植物相似，祗要吸取空氣與泉水，便可在體內直接製造物質，產生熱源，藉以維持生命。楊妹的生理狀態可能有下列兩種塲合：第一塲合，楊妹體內的血紅素或已變質而和植物的葉綠素相似，有了二氧化炭及水，便能生產炭水化物，不必攝取其他食品。第二塲合，楊妹血內或有特殊細菌，能分泌一種酵素，可使血紅素的機能和葉綠素相似，直接在體內製造炭水化物。假使楊妹屬於第一塲合，則世上有一「植物人」，多一奇蹟，茍能發現其原因，則人人可使自己的血紅素變質而終年不食；假使屬於第二塲合，吾人可將楊妹的血液取出少許，用人工培養該種細菌，然後以該細菌移植於人體，則全世界之人類皆可不食。憑這些見解，作者希望李之郁局長注意楊妹的血液性狀及其生理。楊妹既可不食，必　其原因，吾人倘能完全知其秘奧，則人人皆可不食而成所謂「地仙」。楊妹是千載難逢的研究資料，希望全國科學家注意此一資料而愼重研究！</p>

<p>— 雷紅</p>
<p>美國招待國外貴賓的行館在白宮斜對面，被稱爲布藍大廈。政府買受這所大廈是在一九四〇年，主持大廈者是琪恩奈夫人，說她是女主人也好，主婦也好，經理也好，總之她的工作不止冲茶，燒咖啡，她要管理傭僕，書籍，和購買東西。</p>
<p>她曾經招待過中南美洲每一國家的總統。其他如巨哥斯拉夫的彼得王，沙地阿拉伯斐塞爾王子，加拿大總理，以及無數外國大使，公使——莫洛托夫就來過兩次，都到此行館裏來住過。羅斯福總統為了靜養起見，住渦布藍大廈，杜魯門未入白宮前，也住過三星期。</p>
<p>據琪恩奈夫人說，國家領袖是世界最容易招待的人們，因為他們都謙謙有禮。「我總是讓來客靜居室中，不去打攪，」她說，「他們到美國來都有重要任務，他們的心緒不寗。此地是唯一可資休養身心之處，因此我總避不見面。我從不和他們一起用餐，但如要求和我一起喝茶，我也參加　。</p>
<p>人們以為琪恩奈夫人的工作非常輕鬆，事實上她沒有署假寒似，而每天工作總在十二小時至十八小時。如其沒有外國使節招待，闕務卿便利用布藍大廈招待外國大使聚餐，茶點，或晚餐。一旦逢貴賓借宿，則自早餐以至睡眠，都要照料，查看是否一切順利。而伺候貴賓睡眠，總要到午夜三時才可你息下來。</p>
<p>貴賓們時常在離美回國之後，寫信給琪恩奈夫人，充滿上愉快的回憶。每當歲時令節，王公巨卿，都向琪恩奈夫人函電馳賀。</p>
<p>琪恩奈夫人生於華盛頓，二十八年前，她在一次園遊會中遇到布藍夫人，後來布藍夫人請她去主持這所本雪文尼亞街上的貴族大廈，於是即成為大廈的管家，繼續至今，有二十年之久。</p>
<p>後來美國政府買下了這所大廈，等於連琪恩奈夫人也買了過來。她第一次招待政府官吏，博得一致好評，因此國務部請她以服務布藍大廈為終身職業。</p>
<p>沙地阿拉伯王子的拜訪布藍大廈要算最具異國風味的色彩。在王子們居住的一星期中，好像把這所大廈轉成另外一個世界。他們個個是六呎高下，都穿上漂亮的長袍。他們走路沒有聲音。事實上他們在屋子裏，你的確聽不到一點聲音。他們信　宗教極為虔誠，室中香烟繚繞，氤氳可達室外云。</p>

<p>— 雨窗</p>
<p>最近自殺殞命的捷克斯拉夫前外長　瑪薩里克，生前是一個非常風趣的人物</p>
<p>有一次，一位外交官和他談起了美國。那位外交官說：美國的大菜倒不壞，祗是在宴會中你的左右和對面的那些女賓們好像天天有問不完的問題，使你忙於應對，簡直沒有空閒吃東西。</p>

<p>他的方法是：一我先問坐在右面的女客：『您已經結婚了罷？』如果她的回答是『是的』，我就再問她有沒有孩子。似定她回答說：『有兩個。』我就說：『何必？』她就不嚮了……於是我再問坐在我左面的那位女客，原來她也巳經結婚了。我再問她有沒有孩子，她說：『沒有。』我就問：『怎麼會的？』她就不再理我了……我然後再問坐在我對面那位女客：『您結婚沒有？』她說『沒有。』我就再問：『那麼有沒有孩子呢？』——這樣一套問答之後，我就可以安心吃飯，不怕別人打擾了。』</p>

<h3 id="c152">一個奇蹟 <a href="#c152" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e152" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">152</a></h3>
<p>— 津津</p>
<p>一天，筆者因爲職務關係，途經虹口公平路一隅，一眼瞥見路旁一個舊貨攤上，放上一疊用繩索紥在一起的簇新的西文雜誌，我屈下身軀一看，其中有的是法文戲劇雜誌，有的是英國出版的刊物，其中以美國刊行的化學，數學，經濟，社會，新聞學，藝術等雜誌佔大半。經我隨意挑選了五六種，舊貨攤主係論斤計值，結果我花了法幣十九萬元，買到了價值天金二元一角五分的一九四八年四月份至五月份的最新出版的期刊，其中還包括一本今年五月份的讀者文摘在內，在這百物飛漲聲中，不可不說是一個一奇蹟。</p>
<p>筆者震於這奇蹟之餘，却免不了幾點感慨。第一，說來說去，書籍的命遝終是不濟，如果這一些不是書，而是尼隆絲襪，唇膏，鋼筆，或是領帶，也許早巳得善價而沽了。我想肯花錢買價值美金一元的領帶的，總比購買同值的書籍的人，來得多吧。且不要說學以致用，這時代似乎以知識為裝飾品的人，也愈來愈少了。現在我們的耳旁似乎只聽到數字的誇炫，譬如說某甲花七千萬元定製一套西服等等，反之，縱使是附庸風雅之徒，也似乎不合時宜了。</p>
<p>其次，我是一個相信「機會可遇而不可求」的人。什麼時候，我再能買到類似這一次的便宜書，就很難說。我的一位學音樂的朋友，嘗在一家寄售商店內發現某大作曲家的整套唱片，當時以相差數萬元，未能成交，等他帶了錢再去買時，已遭別人捷足先得了。其實，買唱片如此，買書如此，人生的機遇何嘗不然，只是光有機遇，而不知如何運用，依舊無濟於事。這裏常常使我記起某期Flrtune中一篇傳記內的警句云：「機會是給有準備的人支使的。」</p>

<h3 id="e1">The New Executive Yuan is Being Organized; Most Ministerial Heads Confirmed; Weng Wenhao Visits President for Instructions on the List; Likely to be Announced Today; Both the Democratic Socialist and Youth Parties Invited to Nominate Participants <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch of the 25th] Weng Wenhao's new Executive Yuan was being negotiated and organized all day on the 25th. Weng visited the President at nine o'clock in the morning, engaging in a long talk for four hours, finally departing at one o'clock in the afternoon. Weng sought instructions regarding the list of the Deputy Premier, heads of various ministries, and the chief and deputy secretaries-general. He then proceeded to make separate contacts based on these instructions. This list will not be announced until after confirmation through these contacts. It is understood that after consulting with the President, the principles for selecting Weng's new cabinet have been decided. Those who are reappointed without special circumstances will be asked to remain in their positions to leverage their experience. The Youth Party will retain two ministers and two political councilors. The Democratic Socialist Party will retain one minister and two political councilors. Several prominent members of society will also be appointed as ministers and political councilors. As of midnight on the 25th, the list of the new cabinet was largely finalized, and it is expected that it may be announced on the 26th unless other changes occur. This reporter inquired with reliable sources on the evening of the 25th and learned that Deputy Premier Wang Yunwu will not be reappointed. His successor has not yet been determined, but it is certain that the replacement will be a Northerner. Li Weiguo has been internally appointed as the Secretary-General, but he is currently ill in Nanjing and it is not yet known whether he will accept the position. The deputy secretary-general has not been decided, but it is generally believed that Gu Yuquan and Wu Zhaotang are both possibilities. Regarding the ministries, it is said that Foreign Affairs, Transportation, Land Administration, Industry and Commerce (i.e., the Ministry of Economic Affairs), Agriculture and Forestry, Judicial Administration, Health, Overseas Chinese Affairs, and Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs will all be retained by their current occupants. The Directorate-General of Budgets, Accounts and Statistics is newly established and will be headed by Director-General Xu Kan. Sun Yueqi will succeed Weng himself as the head of the National Resources Commission. He Yingqin will replace Bai Chongxi as the Minister of National Defense. Minister of Finance Yu Hongjun will be reassigned as the Governor of the Central Bank, and a replacement will be selected separately; Jiang Tingfu is considered highly likely. Rumors about Wu Guozhen and Xu Kan are unfounded. Xue Xueshi, the Director of Water Resources, has firmly resigned, and it is said that the position will be held for a recommendation from the Democratic Socialist Party. In addition, the incumbents of the Ministries of Interior, Education, Social Affairs, and Food have all expressed their firm intention to resign and are currently being persuaded to stay. It is said that Hong Lanyou may succeed Zhang Lisheng as Minister of Interior, while Gu Zhenggang's resignation from the Ministry of Social Affairs may be withdrawn. There will still be seven political councilors, with the Nationalist, Youth, and Democratic Socialist parties each having two members and one member from among prominent members of society, or no changes are expected. However, Miao Jiaming has been elected as a legislator, and his vacancy will be filled by selecting another person from among prominent members of society.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch of the 25th] In order to continue the policy of cooperation between the three parties, Weng Wenhao, at the beginning of organizing the new cabinet, especially invited Xu Chuanlin, Zeng Qi, and other responsible persons from the Democratic Socialist and Youth parties for a meeting at 3 PM on the 25th, requesting them to nominate participants for the new cabinet. However, it is reported that the two parties expressed that the cabinet formation should wait until the legislator issue is resolved. Subsequently, Lei Zhen stated that the legislator issue will be gradually resolved, while the cabinet formation must be decided first, and they also agreed to discuss and decide later. It is now known that Xu Chuanlin and others from the Democratic Socialist Party have left for Shanghai on the night train on the 25th to convene a meeting of the party's Central Standing Committee to discuss whether to participate in the Executive Yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e2">Premier Weng Issues a Statement; The New Executive Yuan Will Continue the Three-Party Cooperation Policy; Restore Social Order and Stabilize People's Livelihoods; Supervise Subordinates to Make Good Use of US Aid <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch of the 20th] The newly appointed Premier of the Executive Yuan, Weng Wenhao, declared on the 25th that the selection of heads for the various ministries of the new Executive Yuan is actively underway on the 25th, and the announcement will only be made after results have been obtained. The date of the new Executive Yuan's first meeting will also only be determined after the selection of personnel and their appointment by the President. Weng also stated that the new Executive Yuan will continue the three-party cooperation policy, and its personnel will still include members from the Democratic Socialist and Youth parties, as well as non-party individuals. Active consultations are currently being held with the Democratic Socialist and Youth parties.</p>
<p>After the order appointing Weng Wenhao as Premier of the Executive Yuan was announced on the 25th, he held a press conference at the auditorium of the National Resources Commission at 4:30 PM to meet with reporters in his capacity as the new Premier and answer questions. Weng began by saying that in light of the current difficult domestic and international situation, he felt deeply inadequate in talent and overwhelmed by responsibility as he accepted the appointment as the first Premier of the Executive Yuan under the Constitution. However, having been nominated by the President and approved by the Legislative Yuan, he felt a sense of duty and could not decline the appointment. Weng pointed out that at present, while implementing constitutional governance, it is necessary to establish a new government structure in accordance with the Constitution and improve its work efficiency so that it can contribute to the country. At the same time, while it is necessary to mobilize to suppress the rebellion, special efforts must be made to accelerate progress. These two tasks must be carried out in parallel, and responsibility is heavy, requiring fairness, proactivity, and genuine reform. Weng believes that the biggest difficulties at present are currency inflation, rising prices, inconvenient transportation, and reduced production, which have led to difficulties in people's livelihoods. The reason for this is that after eight years of resistance against Japan, the country has not had time to recover and was immediately confronted with the communist rebellion, leading to the current situation. In the future, the government will address these causes, prescribe the right medicine, and try its best to alleviate these difficulties, restore social order as soon as possible, and improve people's lives. Regarding the issue of US aid, Weng explained that the United States, in view of China's economic difficulties, is making its best effort to provide material assistance to China. In his position as Premier of the Executive Yuan, he will supervise his subordinates to make good use of this aid, fully leveraging its effectiveness to alleviate the economic crisis, relieve the people's suffering, and seize this opportunity to seek the country's revival. Weng also said that the President has clearly indicated the major policies upon taking office, and he will work with his colleagues in the government to promote them in the future. At present, our tasks are both numerous and significant, and there are many problems to be solved and many possible difficulties. The Executive Yuan has an unshirkable responsibility, and he will work diligently, regardless of difficulties or personal gain, to live up to the expectations of the people of the country. If he fails to accomplish his mission, he will resolutely step down to conform to the spirit of constitutional government. He hopes that his colleagues in the government will cooperate sincerely and that prominent members of society and public opinion will provide guidance. Specific policy proposals will be announced after the Executive Yuan is formed.</p>
<p>Weng then answered questions from Chinese and foreign reporters. Weng avoided giving direct answers to questions about the selection of personnel for the new Executive Yuan, saying only that everything would be clear after the list of the new cabinet is announced. One reporter asked what the content of the so-called reform was. Weng said that it was too early to talk about the content at this time. One reporter asked whether Weng was satisfied with the previous foreign policy and whether Weng would continue to maintain the past policy or make changes in the future. Weng replied that the basic principle of diplomacy is to safeguard the integrity of national territory and sovereignty. As for specific methods, the international situation is constantly changing, so attention should be paid at all times, and countermeasures should be decided.</p>

<p>[Our Chongqing Dispatch of the 25th] Zhang Qun sent a telegram this morning to congratulate Weng Wenhao, saying: "Premier Weng Yongni of the Executive Yuan in Nanjing: Having read the newspaper and learned that you have been appointed as Premier of the Executive Yuan, I am deeply relieved to be relieved of my duties. You have achieved great academic accomplishments and high moral character, and your appointment to this difficult task is celebrated by the people of the country. I extend my congratulations and wish you well in your new role."</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 25th] Wu Tiecheng sent a telegram to congratulate Weng Wenhao, saying: "I am delighted to hear that you have been honored as the first Premier of the Executive Yuan under the Constitution, overseeing the administration of state affairs, and assisting the central government. I look forward to the spirit of harmony in the times. Congratulations."</p>
<h3 id="e4">"Bread is More Important Than Freedom" Jiang Tingfu Discusses the China Problem in New York; Solutions Should Start with Economics <a href="#e4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, New York, 24th] Jiang Tingfu, our representative to the UN Security Council, told US reserve officers here that the Chinese government is taking concrete steps to implement land reform to improve the living standards of Chinese farmers. Comparing Russia in 1917 and China in 1948, Jiang said that both countries had a large number of uneducated and poor people, whose primary concern was poverty and hunger, and their need for bread was far greater than their need for freedom. Regarding the differences in land reform between the two countries, Jiang continued, "Russia had large landlords and large industries owned by the aristocracy, but currently China only has small landlords with small properties, so land ownership in China cannot be used as a target of revolution as it was in Russia." Jiang continued that the land reform implemented by the Chinese Communist Party is difficult to implement because the land allocated is very small, so farmers benefit very little. Jiang pointed out that the news about China published in American newspapers and magazines is mostly sensational and rarely gives a fair report on China's achievements and failures. One of China's greatest achievements is the abolition of foreign extraterritoriality in China under the leadership of the Chinese government, a step that has fulfilled the expectations and aspirations of all Chinese people. The audience was very interested in the China problem and asked several questions on the spot, including: (1) How will China's inflation be curbed? (2) What is the trend of eliminating the Communist Party's threat? (3) What is the future of China's industrialization? Jiang answered each of the above questions with a firm and enthusiastic attitude, and the crowd applauded warmly. Jiang's central theory is that the best way to solve China's many problems is to start with economics, and the United States should not be impatient with China's slow progress, because the problems of one country are very different from those of another.</p>

<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch of the 25th] It is learned that Jiang Tingfu, our representative to the UN Security Council, will return home in the near future. In Weng Wenhao's new Executive Yuan, it is planned to ask Jiang to serve as Minister of Finance, and Jiang's return home is related to this matter.</p>
<h3 id="e6">Mo Dehui Tours Scenic Spots; Saying He Will be Appointed Deputy Premier is Inaccurate <a href="#e6" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c6" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">6</a></h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch of the 25th] Mo Dehui took the Jinghu train from Nanjing to Zhenjiang at 8 AM on the 25th to tour Jinshan and Jiaoshan, and it is said that he will continue to travel to scenic spots along the Jinghu Railway. Political circles here speculate that Mo may be appointed as Deputy Premier of the Executive Yuan, as the President has announced that if the Premier of the Executive Yuan is from the South, the Deputy Premier must be from the North. However, according to reliable sources, this statement is absolutely inaccurate. Mo's trip to scenic spots along the Jinghu Line is likely to indicate that he has not participated in Weng Wenhao's cabinet formation.</p>
<h3 id="e7">Zhang Qun Flies to Chengdu Today <a href="#e7" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c7" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">7</a></h3>

<h3 id="e8">The Legislative Yuan Accepted the First Petition Yesterday; Anhui Students Oppose Li Pinxian <a href="#e8" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c8" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">8</a></h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch of the 25th] The first Legislative Yuan under the Constitution accepted its first petition on the 25th. In the morning, a large number of slogans against Li Pinxian were found on Linsen Road, where the National Assembly Hall of the Legislative Yuan is located. At 9 AM, dozens of Anhui students gathered at the entrance of the hall to petition. The Legislative Yuan appointed four members, including Li Yingsheng, Chen Zifeng, Wu Yunpeng, and Cheng Qibao, to receive them during the meeting, and Cheng reported on the process at 11 AM, stating that the students submitted a petition listing twelve "crimes against Anhui" by Chairman Li Pinxian and requested the Legislative Yuan to forward it to the government for sanctions. A student representative also reported verbally that they had repeatedly voiced their grievances against Li's harsh rule in Anhui to the government and the National Assembly, but the government had never given a clear and concrete response. Today, they specifically petition the Legislative Yuan in accordance with the Constitution, requesting that it uphold justice and forward it to the government for attention. Cheng et al. also believed that the number of petition cases would inevitably increase day by day and suggested appointing someone specifically responsible for receiving petitioners and collecting petitions.</p>
<h3 id="e9">Fourth Meeting of the Legislative Yuan; Discussing Amendments to the Organization Law; Establishing a Special Committee to Conduct Review <a href="#e9" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c9" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">9</a></h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch of the 25th] The fourth meeting of the first session of the Legislative Yuan was held on the 25th. President Sun presided over the meeting at 9:35 AM. After passing the minutes of the third meeting, four members, including Li Yingsheng, Chen Ziji, Wu Yunpeng, and Cheng Qibao, were elected to represent the Legislative Yuan in receiving Anhui students who were petitioning outside the meeting. Then, they proceeded to discuss agenda items. The meeting agenda listed three proposals from various members: (1) Chen Guyuan et al. proposed amending Articles 4 and 5 of the Legislative Yuan Organization Law regarding the organization of various committees. (2) Xu Panjun et al. proposed establishing a Maritime Affairs Committee in accordance with Article 3 of the Legislative Yuan Organization Law. (3) Tian Yushi et al. proposed amending Article 19 of the Legislative Yuan Organization Law. Then, according to the order of the proposals, the agenda was changed, and Tian's proposal was discussed first. When presenting his proposal, the proposer Tian Yushi first stated that the motivation for the proposal was directed at the law and at the matter, and definitely not at any person. He believed that the Secretary-General of the Legislative Yuan serves the entire Yuan and is responsible to the entire Yuan. The original Organization Law stipulated that the appointment should be made after the President of the Yuan submits it to the Yuan for decision. The current Organization Law cancels this procedure. According to the custom of various countries and parliamentary procedures, the Secretary-General is elected by the meeting, but now the Legislative Yuan meeting cannot even obtain a resolution of consent, which is inappropriate. In order to ensure that the opinions of the President of the Yuan are respected by the consensus of the members and that the duties of the Secretary-General are fully guaranteed, he proposed restoring the provisions of the original Organization Law. After Tian's explanation, a heated debate arose, and members spoke one after another. At 10:40 AM, the discussion was stopped, and a vote was taken to refer it for review first with the approval of 383 out of 514 members present. Jian Guansan then proposed that each unit nominate one person to form a temporary review committee to summarize everyone's opinions within two days and present them at the Friday regular meeting. However, President Sun's proposal was ultimately adopted to leave this case to the Legislative System Committee for review after its establishment. After a break, the meeting continued, and after listening to Cheng Qibao report on their reception of the petitioning students from Anhui, the discussion of Chen's proposal began. Chen Guyuan explained that the focus of his proposal was to dilute the special status and power of the conveners of the various committees and to prevent the various committees from being difficult to convene due to the excessive number of participants. The members put forward their opinions one after another. As the adjournment time was approaching, President Sun asked whether a special committee could be formed to specifically review matters related to amendments to the Organization Law. This was agreed upon by the members, and it was decided that the organization of the special committee would be discussed at the afternoon meeting. The meeting adjourned at 12:00 noon.</p>
<p>At 3:35 PM in the afternoon, the meeting continued to discuss matters regarding the organization of the special review committee. Zheng Jiajun and others spoke in succession. Finally, President Sun sought the consent of the assembly, stopped the discussion, and summarized the opinions of the various members. Regarding the organization of the special review committee, in addition to the speakers and proposers from the Drafting Committee on the Rules of Procedure at today's meeting, all members can participate freely. The special review committee is scheduled to conduct the review on the afternoons of the 26th and 27th, and the review results will be presented for discussion at the regular meeting on the 28th. This was passed by the Legislative Yuan members present without objection, and all proposals were submitted to the special review committee for review first. The meeting adjourned at 4:20 PM in the afternoon.</p>

<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch of the 25th] The National Grain Association called on the entire country to exempt grain from business tax.

The secretariat of the preparatory committee also received a notice from the Secretary-General of the Presidential Office on the 23rd. However, because the production of the first Premier of the Executive Yuan under the Constitution was somewhat later than expected, the meeting convening order was only issued on the 26th. To allow Control Yuan members from afar to arrive in Nanjing in time for the meeting, the President changed the meeting date to June 5th).</p>

Hu said, "He has both scientific knowledge and administrative experience, and we very much hope that under his leadership, special attention and improvement will be given to the politics of experts."</p>

<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch of the 25th] The Executive Yuan recently sent President's Directive No. 6 Tong (1) issued on May 24, 37th year of the Republic of China, which reads: The President took office on the 20th of this month, all civil and military officials at all levels throughout the country, those entrusted by the Chairman of the former National Government, should continue to serve in their original positions as usual until the President makes other appointments and removals. After the Executive Yuan sent the directive, it specially telegraphed all ministries, commissions, bureaus, and provincial and municipal governments to follow suit.</p>
<h3 id="e19">Washington Praises Premier Weng; Officials Believe He Will Be Able to Fulfill His Responsibilities Pleasantly; Sufficient to Cooperate with the US Aid to China Plan <a href="#e19" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c19" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">19</a></h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 24th, Associated Press] Here, officials and diplomatic figures have reacted very favorably to President Jiang's appointment of Weng Wen-hao as Premier of the Executive Yuan. They all believe that if Mr. Weng is granted sufficient power, he will certainly be able to fulfill his responsibilities pleasantly and make a great contribution to China. Officials here all know that he is a free-thinking individual, and many American and other national officials who have traveled to China or served in China are very impressed with him. They all believe that Mr. Weng is not only loyal to his country but also proficient in foreign languages and able to get along well with representatives from other countries. Diplomatic figures believe that Weng Wenhao is very familiar with engineering and economic conditions, and the reason why President Jiang selected him as Premier of the Executive Yuan is partly because he believes that he is qualified to cooperate with the US aid to China plan.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Nanjing, 25th] The new Premier of the Executive Yuan, Weng Wenhao, is probably one of the shortest prime ministers in the world, standing 5 feet tall and weighing only 90 pounds, but his energy is extraordinary, and he can work 15 hours a day without getting tired, partly due to his low blood pressure of 90 degrees and partly due to his simple life. President Jiang's selection of Weng as Premier of the Executive Yuan this time is due to his outstanding administrative talent. For 16 years, he has led the National Resources Commission from its inception to its development into a powerful agency, employing 300,000 people, controlling 98 percent of the country's steel production, 35 percent of coal production, and 65 percent of electricity production, as well as 100 percent of important metals such as tin and iron. Weng has a strong memory and can recall the production tonnage of a certain mine or factory at will. He is quiet, detached, and does not like crowds, but he likes to talk with a few people. Weng is meticulous in handling official affairs, does not like to write flowery prose, but focuses on effectiveness and does not want people to make excuses for shirking responsibility.</p>

<h3 id="e25">The Future of US-Soviet Diplomacy <a href="#e25" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c25" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">25</a></h3>
<p>— Wang Chengzhu</p>
<p>Since the Soviet Union disclosed the exchange of letters between the US Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Smith, and the Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov, the reactions of various countries have been initially shocked, then disappointed. Within a short period of several days, many changes have occurred.</p>
<p>The complex international situation has shifted quickly, making it difficult to determine whether we should be optimistic or pessimistic. Even personal disagreements are difficult to resolve immediately, let alone conflicts between two major powers on the international stage. However, the international "Cold War" is unlikely to escalate into all-out warfare as easily as a personal feud.</p>
<p>General reactions have been extremely praiseworthy of the Soviet authorities' expressions of their love for peace, while severely criticizing the American authorities for maintaining their current foreign policy and refusing direct negotiations between the two countries, demonstrating that everyone is deeply eager for genuine post-war peace. However, we must understand that before the Soviet Union's expressions of love for peace are concretely demonstrated in action, the current American policy cannot easily be shaken, precisely because the American political system is fundamentally different from that of the Soviet Union. In fact, the Soviet Union's policy has not changed after this exchange of letters; they simply did not need to issue another statement on this point.</p>
<p>America's refusal to continue direct negotiations does not mean that it is unwilling to cooperate; otherwise, why would there have been an exchange of letters in the first place? Marshall's statement that direct negotiations between the two countries would only waste time and delay opportunities is a justifiable reason. As British Foreign Secretary Bevin pointed out, the Soviet Union's sudden announcement of the exchange of letters through TASS has already violated diplomatic precedent and is a means of seeking world sympathy. However, the United States is not suddenly asking the Soviet Union to openly discuss international disputes, only to then refuse to discuss them. The United States is only refusing a negotiating format limited to the US and the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union does not seem to have formally stated that it insists on continued negotiations between the two countries.</p>
<p>Allowing the US and the Soviet Union to determine the fate of the world in a conference room is unlikely to be effective, just as it was on the battlefield. The current disputes are not limited to the interests of the two countries themselves, but involve many other countries. If the United States resolutely engaged in individual negotiations with the Soviet Union, and the Soviet Union actually agreed, critics who are now satirizing the United States for lacking courage would have already risen up in opposition to their collusion and used the interests of other countries as a gamble. We do not support a repetition of the Yalta Conference today, so why criticize the United States for being inconsistent?</p>
<p>However, this statement by the American authorities does not close the door to changes in the international situation. Various United Nations conferences and foreign ministers' conferences provide opportunities for both sides to express compromise and cooperation. Not only the Soviet Union, but any country's expression of love for peace can only be concretely demonstrated in these venues. The tense international situation, from the atomic bomb issue to the Berlin traffic control, are all the evil consequences of the failure of those conferences. Therefore, one of the key factors for the future is the smooth progress of these conferences.</p>
<p>After the exchange of letters between the United States and the Soviet Union, the most recent important news about the Soviet Union is the upcoming change in the duties of Gromyko, the representative to the United Nations, with Malik succeeding him. Regardless of how Gromyko will be promoted or transferred, replacing him with a new person at this time is likely to be a further indication that Soviet policy is indeed preparing for a change of course. Before the new representative's words and actions are confirmed, we should not rashly place too high expectations on this personnel change. However, the future trends should be slightly revealed in the short term.</p>
<p>Several international conferences need to be held successively. In order to determine the future status of the defeated countries and the rights and interests of the victorious countries towards them, only the peace treaty with Italy has been established to be relatively important, and there are still many remaining issues, such as the disposition of Italy's former territories and the establishment or modification of the new system of joint management of the Port of Trieste. A peace treaty with Austria has been drafted but not completed. The conferences on the peace treaties with Germany and Japan, which are most crucial to ending World War II, have been repeatedly delayed and are nowhere in sight. These are important cases that have been suspended for a long time due to the Soviet Union's tougher stance after the establishment of the Romanian and Bulgarian treaties, and the unwillingness of the United Kingdom, the United States, and other countries to make further concessions. In addition, conferences such as the Danube River Navigation Rights Conference are narrower in scope, but the issues involved are also quite complex.</p>
<p>After every major war, it is normal for the victorious countries to quarrel due to the uneven distribution of spoils. The fundamental goal of participating in a war is not simply self-defense; as far as possible, one always hopes to gain new harvests and strengthen one's own position in order to avoid repeating the mistakes of being invaded. The Soviet Union's efforts to expand its control over Eastern European countries, its refusal to let go of Czechoslovakia, its refusal to withdraw from Lushun and Dalian, and its strengthening of the occupation of North Korea are all under the pretext of safeguarding security. The United States' efforts to promote the reconstruction and unity of Western European countries and its aid to countries such as Greece and Turkey are also under the pretext of safeguarding peace. However, due to the fundamental differences in the political and social systems of the United States and the Soviet Union, there is a deeper level of mutual suspicion. The Soviet Union can suspect that the United States has a conspiracy to encircle it, and the United States can condemn the Soviet Union for having a conspiracy to undermine its markets and incite labor unrest.</p>
<p>The outcome of this war has another characteristic, which is that the defeated countries have already been divided and occupied by the victorious countries. Therefore, preventing the defeated countries from becoming a force that disrupts world peace has ceased to be a common goal for the victorious countries to cooperate. Instead, the victorious countries have increased many suspicions among themselves. The quantity of movable factory equipment that is moved is not fully disclosed; they mutually criticize each other's methods of utilizing immovable resources. Even the Soviet Union suspects that the United States is supporting the industry and commerce of Japan with ulterior motives; and the United States also suspects that the Soviet Union is going to use communist organizations to control the entire territory of Germany. Under this unprecedented new situation, the victorious countries have naturally transformed into mutual infighting, replacing cooperation.</p>
<p>However, under this tense situation, it would be an overestimation to believe that World War III is on the verge of breaking out. The progress of modern international relations and war tools has already made the world nature of major wars more and more extensive. World War III will indeed inevitably break out in the end, but it will certainly not happen in the period after World War II when reconstruction has not yet been completed. Although the Soviet Union maintains the strongest army on the continent and the United States has re-expanded its military after completing demobilization, these are not enough to serve as a harbinger of development; they are merely using military force to strengthen their diplomatic power.</p>
<p>We believe that both the United States and the Soviet Union still yearn for peace, but neither side is willing to easily concede. The Soviet Union has already gained an advantage in controlling Eastern European countries, and in terms of the supply and demand situation of materials in various regions, it cannot support a policy of isolation for long. The United States is using large amounts of materials to win over countries in the East and the West, while at the same time preventing the actions of the Soviet Union everywhere, but it cannot support this for long either. The latter's authorities, in order to win the support of the domestic people, especially need a guarantee of peace. Therefore, the recent exchange of letters between the two countries, and the change in the Soviet Union's representative to the United Nations, have gradually shifted the diplomatic positions of the two countries in order to conduct the above-mentioned important conferences. This is a very possible development. If these conferences can reach more appropriate decisions in a relatively harmonious atmosphere, international relations can regain stability. This change is likely to have concrete manifestations in the short term.</p>
<p>As for the way to break the deadlock between the United States and the Soviet Union, it does not necessarily require a meeting between the leaders of the two countries. The most convenient way is the resumption of the foreign ministers' conference. The United States' plan to aid the reconstruction of Western Europe is unlikely to be shaken due to the improvement of US-Soviet relations, but it will inevitably be extended to Eastern Europe. The plans to aid Greece, Turkey, and China will also not be entirely shaken, but they will inevitably be modified. World peace between the United States and the Soviet Union may not be realized following this, but we always hope that the coming of world peace can be brought closer as a result of the opening of the US-Soviet deadlock.</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, Chengde, 24th] A heroic story of collective suicide by forty people was staged in the defense of Chengde. This story can shock heaven and earth. Two battalions of the light and heavy troops of the National Army stationed at Elephant Nose Mountain were attacked by at least six times their force starting on the 14th of this month. They fought fiercely for three days and nights, killing more than 400 bandits and wounding twice as many. By the 19th, in order to concentrate their forces, they were ordered to transfer their positions. At that time, Sergeant Squad Leader Yan Daozong, Corporal Guo Zhifu, Private Liu Dunmin, and forty soldiers refused to withdraw, willing to stay in place and resist alone, and to lay the groundwork for a counterattack in the future. From then on, they launched a miserable and heroic struggle with the bandits, which lasted for four days. Countless bandits were killed, and their own losses increased daily. No one was slightly afraid. Until the night of the 19th, because of more and more casualties and the exhaustion of ammunition, all the soldiers committed suicide after shouting "Long live the Republic of China!" No one survived intact. After receiving the report, Commander Shi believed that the soldiers' loyal and brave performance of regarding death as home was sufficient to be the light of the country and the glory of the army. In addition to submitting a special case to the Central District for preferential treatment, he also ordered all officers and soldiers of the army to pay the highest respect to the forty warriors, and the whole city flew flags at half-mast to mourn them.

The evening newspapers of the 25th all published the news of this "Police Chief's Son Becomes a Thief" in a prominent position. Those familiar with the Wang family, including security personnel, were all saddened by the only adopted son's deviation. According to police personnel, Wang Kejia's fraudulent and thieving behavior has become an incorrigible habit for several years. In Chongqing, in addition to habitually "breaking in" and stealing in the hallways, he has also repeatedly used his skills in the Lianglukou highway station area to abduct the travel expenses and baggage of passengers between Chongqing and Chengdu. He was arrested and detained by the detective team for half a year. His adoptive father in Chongqing had long stated that he knew nothing about his reckless behavior and did not care about it. Although he did not publish a statement in the newspaper, there was really no relationship. After the victory, police officers thought that his family environment was wealthy after the restoration, so he would not commit crimes again. Wang Kejia was also introduced by his brother-in-law, Du Zui, the current chief of the Huangpu Branch of the Shanghai Police Department, to work in the East District Cleaning Team. Later, he left after eating empty names. He roamed the capital, once wearing the uniform of Officer Liu of the South District Bureau. Later, he was spotted by Liu in the Dahua Cinema and taken to the West District Police Department, where he was released after being admonished. This spring, he caused trouble at the home of dancer Xiao Jinyu, impersonating an inspector from the Garrison Headquarters. However, he revealed his identity when the badge he wore turned out to be from the 36th year. He took advantage of his escape. Later, the East District Police Department arrested a thief in the Central Hospital, but before he could be interrogated, he escaped. Among the belongings left by the fugitive was a piece of paper with Wang Kejia's handwriting and address. The guard police Tao Kun was held in custody at the Capital District Court for failing to guard the convenience of the late escape. On the morning of the 24th, Wang Kejia and a partner, Chen Songlin, went to the dormitory of the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry to "break in." Unexpectedly, when they stole a raincoat and shook it out, they were recognized by the guard, arrested together, and sent to the Internal Police Headquarters for temporary custody. Upon hearing the news, the East District Bureau prepared a document on the morning of the 25th to bring them in for questioning without error, and decided to send them to the Capital Police Department on the morning of the 26th for transfer to the District Court for trial. The police were confused as to the reasons for Wang Kejia's lack of proper employment. Wang</p>
<h3 id="e39">Transporting Metal Subsidiary Coins: Ministry of Finance Grants Freedom <a href="#e39" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c39" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">39</a></h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 25th] During the War of Resistance, the Japanese enemy redeemed and purchased metal subsidiary coins within our territory to use as ordnance materials. To prevent assisting the enemy, the Ministry of Finance stipulated: "Travelers carrying various subsidiary coins and old copper coins within the mainland are strictly prohibited from carrying them privately unless they hold a transport permit issued by the Ministry or a remittance certificate from the Central Bank. Violators, regardless of the quantity, will be treated as contraband." This was telegraphed and announced in February of the 35th year [of the Republic]. Now, due to changing circumstances, the Ministry has decided to abolish the aforementioned telegraph regulations and stipulates that henceforth, people carrying copper coins, cash coins, or other metal subsidiary coins will be allowed to transport them freely, without requiring verification of the Ministry's transport permit or the Central Bank's remittance certificate, unless they intend to destroy them for profit or smuggle them abroad, in which case they will still be punished according to Article 1 of the "Regulations for the Punishment of Offenses Against National Currency." This measure has been reported to the Executive Yuan by the Ministry of Finance for record and telegraphed to relevant agencies for implementation.</p>
<p>Gu Pan's former wife did not bear a son, so Wang City's family adopted him from a young age. He was quite intelligent, but unexpectedly became so depraved, which is attributed to inherited nature. After the newspaper reporter investigated the facts and circumstances, they visited Wang Kejia and Chen Songlin in the detention room. Wang Kejia was very eloquent and articulate, with a very organized train of thought. He did not deny the crime and had repeatedly wondered if he had a mental illness. However, his conclusion was that the formation of habits and the influence of the environment accounted for a larger proportion. He said that his father had always adopted a laissez-faire attitude towards him, and the security authorities often indulged him because of his father's connections, leading to the present situation. Holding newspaper clippings from various evening papers, he wiped away tears and said that he had caused his father another loss of reputation, expressing extreme remorse. He vowed not to complain about his father anymore. He had gone to Shanghai when his father remarried, intending to repent and start anew, but the family was too busy at the time to allow him to speak, so he returned dejectedly. His cousin intended to help him engage in journalism in Beijing, and the establishment of the "China News Agency" was already on file with the News Bureau of the Ministry of Interior, yet this incident occurred. Chen Songlin, from Changsha, claimed that his brother was currently a battalion commander in the 71st Division. He had studied at the Hunan Provincial Xiangtan Normal School and joined the Youth Expeditionary Force 205th Division. After the victory, he was recommended by the demobilization bureau to the Wuhan University preparatory class, but was later expelled. He drifted to Beijing and went astray due to the pressure of life. Wang Kejia said that he had not eaten for two days. He never stopped wanting to change, but society had no place to accommodate him, and the pressure of life became deeper and deeper. He expressed deep regret and shame towards his father, but eagerly wanted to suffer the punishment he deserved and did not want anyone to be lenient again. He also said: "Please tell all young people in the world, never make a mistake, one wrong step and you can't go back." He felt quite lost about his future after being released from prison.</p>

Liu Aishan and others from the Xiangyin petition group arrived on foot in the middle of the night on the 24th and attended the farewell meeting to report on the disaster situation in the county. They said that the entire county had become a swamp, and the early rice was completely hopeless. The late rice also needs to be judged based on the receding of the river water. If it cannot recede by one zhang within ten days, there is no hope for planting late rice. At present, the poor people in Binhu are all empty-handed. Not only is there no rice flour to cook, but there is also a shortage of rice seeds. They hope that Mao will investigate the disaster and give a light loan of seeds to seek the remediation of late rice under the possible situation.</p>

<h3 id="e48">In Memory of General Dai Anlan <a href="#e48" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c48" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">48</a></h3>
<p>— Du Weiming</p>
<p>The winds and clouds over the Pacific ignited the flames of the expedition to Burma. Our Chinese heroes, in a heroic posture, appeared on the unprecedented battlefield. The National Army extended assistance righteously, fighting alongside the Allied forces. This can be said to be a historic feat! General Dai Anlan led the 200th Division of the Army as the vanguard of the National Army, opening the way for this expedition and displaying the ability to attack and defend, providing safe and powerful cover for the 100,000-strong expeditionary force, allowing them to penetrate into foreign countries to achieve the greatest strategic objective and alleviate the crisis of the Allied forces. It can also be said that it was the most glorious page in the history of our army's resistance against Japan, completed under all difficult conditions! But unfortunately, during the transfer of battles, he was wounded and died heroically while breaking through the enemy's encirclement. Time is as fast as lightning, and in the blink of an eye, it has come to the sixth anniversary of General Dai's heroic death, which makes us, on this day of commemoration, recall the past with endless sadness and pain!</p>
<p>General Dai Anlan's heroic sacrifice occurred on May 26, 1942 [Gregorian calendar]. During the expedition, he resolutely defended Toungoo, rushed to the aid of Chokepaduang, and captured Taunggyi. Just as he was preparing to participate in the Battle of Debre, the British army unexpectedly withdrew automatically, and the rear route on the left flank was cut off. The General was ordered to retreat and rushed overnight. The areas he passed through were all towering mountains and desolate areas. There were no people and no food. All highways, rivers, mountain passes, and key roads were guarded by the Japanese in advance. The General disregarded his own safety, fought bravely while wounded, and the entire division was of one mind, vowing to destroy the Japanese pirates. They broke through five heavily guarded passes one after another, completing the mission of returning the entire division, but he died of his wounds in Mao Bang Village, Burma. When I heard the news of his heroic death, I was marching in the foothills of the uninhabited Hukawng Valley in northern Burma, fighting the enemy while suffering from the encroachment of miasma and rain. Although I did not encounter large enemies or fierce beasts and poisonous snakes, there were countless ants, mosquitoes, and leeches in the primeval forest, enough to kill people. I watched thousands upon thousands of soldiers struggling with hunger, suffering from malaria, and being sucked dry by leeches. What's more, flies, gnats, and ants gathered and sucked, leaving the heroic soldiers helpless. Even if they fell to the ground, they would be turned into withered bones within a few hours after being sucked by these small insects. This kind of tragic scene is simply indescribable. Thinking of the General's experiences before and after his injury, it was the same as this, truly tragic and heartbreaking, leaving me wanting to cry but having no tears. In addition, camping in desolate mountains, secluded valleys, and primeval forests made it impossible to summon his soul and hold a memorial ceremony, making me feel even more guilty and unable to excuse myself!</p>
<p>I worked with General Zhan for the longest time and knew him the deepest. He had a majestic appearance and a resolute personality. His attitude seemed aloof and unrestrained, but his heart was extremely sensitive and full of affection. In the process of interacting with him, I regarded him as a beneficial friend who could correct each other's mistakes and a comrade-in-arms who could share weal and woe. As early as when we were colleagues at the military academy, we were still young. His aura of looking down on the crowd and his shrewd and capable talent had already left a very deep impression on my mind. I felt that he was an extraordinary talent. Sometimes, when we discussed ancient and modern times, he rarely approved of people, but he had a style of taking responsibility, knowing shame, and not avoiding labor and resentment, showing his ambition to shoulder heavy responsibilities and go far. After the military academy, we each embarked on our respective journeys. He showed amazing achievements in suppressing bandits in Henan and Anhui, resisting Japan at the Great Wall, and in the early stages of the War of Resistance, such as the Battle of Taierzhuang. When he was transferred to the 200th Division, the reunion of old friends was like a new life. I was happy to have someone who could carry on the past, and General Dai was also happy to have the opportunity to work together again, which further increased our spirit of moving forward bravely and our belief in killing enemies and serving the country. It was not until later that I saw his poem when he set out for Burma, "A whip points to flowers like promised, Zhuge's past life is coming again," that I knew that this talented and courageous person was a worshiper of Zhuge Wuhou, but his fate was the same as Zhuge Wuhou, and it made people feel the sigh of "he died before he could accomplish his mission, and it made heroes' tears fill their clothes!"</p>
<p>General Dai's management of the army was strict and his training was effective. He was able to put into practice Chairman Chiang's instructions of "high skills and great resistance," studying the codes carefully and teaching while fighting, making the 200th Division harmonious and united, with everyone of one mind. The technology was skilled, and officers and soldiers were integrated. Not only did the Military Affairs Commission inspection consider it the best in the country, but the Battle of Kunlun Pass especially demonstrated the achievements of its training, setting a precedent for turning from defense to offense since the War of Resistance, and achieving the effect of attacking strongholds, overcoming dangers, and gathering and annihilating stubborn enemies. He braved the summer heat to go on an expedition to Burma. He traveled east and west for several months, conquering every attack and solidifying every defense, carrying out his tasks and not shirking from difficulties, further displaying his military genius and showing his military virtue. This is not "catering to his preferences." Anyone familiar with the achievements of our army probably feels the same. General died at the young age of 38, he had not yet seen the victory of the War of Resistance, nor had he completed the great cause of national construction, which makes us feel endless sorrow in addition to admiration. And I and the General have been together for more than ten years, like milk and water, with feelings like brothers, but we were broken halfway through. What a trauma this is. Looking around today, the Central Plains is boiling and the war is urgent. "Hearing the drums makes me think of generals and commanders." General's early death feels like an irreparable loss to the country. The heroes of the nation have passed away with the wheels of the times. In mourning the dead and considering the future, I cannot help but feel a sense of independence. However, General Dai's loyalty and achievements stand tall in the mountains and rivers, shining on the sun and the moon. Their brilliance is dazzling, shocking the past and shaking the present, and it is enough to strengthen our confidence and encourage our courage. We will continue to follow in General Dai's footsteps with sweat and hesitation, and then complete the mission of suppressing the rebellion and building the country.</p>
<p>Dai's Coffin Buried in Wu</p>
<p>[This newspaper Wuhu 25th dispatch] Dai Anlan, the late division commander, was originally scheduled to be buried on May 26, the sixth anniversary of his heroic death in Burma, but because the state funeral had not yet been approved, Generals Du Yuming and Xu Tingyao will not come to Wu for the time being. His family members were afraid that the coffin would be left unattended for too long, so they hastily buried it a few days ago, and will hold a ceremony later after the government approves the funeral.</p>

<h3 id="e49">Just Like the Czech Incident: Finnish Communists Brew Coup: Announce the Establishment of the National Action Committee: Inciting a General Strike Under the Pretext of Dismissing the Interior Minister <a href="#e49" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c49" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">49</a></h3>
<p>[United Press International, Helsinki, 24th] Workers across Finland went on strike on the 24th to protest the government's decision to remove the communist interior minister, Laine. This communist tactic is exactly the same as that adopted in the Czech coup three months ago. As the Finnish capital was shocked by the launch of communist tactics, the Finnish cabinet held an emergency meeting. The seriousness of the situation was unprecedented, and there was a risk of it evolving into a full-scale communist attempt to seize power and force Finland to join the Soviet "Iron Curtain" group.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Helsinki, 24th] The Finnish People's Democratic Party, formed by the merger of the Finnish Communist Party and the left-wing Social Democratic Party, brewed a general strike to coerce the government into appointing a member of the People's Democratic Party to succeed the Interior Minister before the party formed an "Action Committee" today to "lead and unify national actions to ensure that the government's lineup does not change before the general election." A non-communist cabinet member told this agency that "We know what the Communist Party's plan is and will never allow it to be implemented. The police have been ordered to be on alert, and the army is also staying in the barracks." Due to the stalemate between President Paasikivi and the People's Democratic Party over the selection of the Interior Minister, Helsinki is on the eve of a storm tonight, and there is a risk of open unrest and street fighting breaking out. The People's Democratic Party has organized strikes across the country, saying that if the President does not appoint a member of the People's Democratic Party to replace the current Interior Minister Kirpil of the Democratic Social Party and fill the currently vacant post of Foreign Vice Minister, they will launch a nationwide general strike tomorrow. They also threatened to "surround" the government building on the 25th when the President convenes the cabinet to decide on the candidates for Interior Minister and Foreign Vice Minister. The immediate cause of the crisis was the dismissal of Communist Interior Minister Laine after being impeached by the parliament. When the parliament met last week, it confirmed that Laine had illegally extradited two Finnish nationals and ten stateless people to the Soviet Union in 1945, and passed a motion to impeach Laine.</p>
<p>The People's Democratic Party ordered its members across the country to launch strikes today as a prelude to the general strike on the 25th. The strike by dockworkers in Helsinki has prevented 34 ships scheduled to be exported this morning from being exported, and other ports have also been affected. At the same time, the "Trade Union Association," which is dominated by the Social Democratic Party, passed a resolution with 162 votes against 141, declaring that the strikes that occurred today disregarded the authority of the trade union, intended to cause political unrest, and were clearly contrary to democratic procedures. The organization of the Action Committee was announced today by Koro, Chairman of the People's Democratic Party. The party's newspaper, "Vapaa Sana," said that Paasikivi's refusal to restore Laine to his post was using the methods of the Czech reactionaries. Laine himself addressed a People's Democratic Party conference attended by 30,000 people today, saying that his dismissal and the events caused by it were the result of the reactionary forces' attack on democracy. He firmly demanded that the People's Democratic Party take over the post of Interior Minister. The audience at the scene shouted for Laine's reinstatement and vowed to achieve this goal by force. According to recent news, the Social Democratic Party is putting pressure on workers in various factories and shops to resume work.</p>
<h3 id="e50">The U.S. Ignores the Soviet Union's Use of Veto Power and Still Investigates the Czech Coup <a href="#e50" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c50" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">50</a></h3>
<p>[Reuters Lake Success 25th dispatch] U.S. Representative to the Security Council Austin issued a statement today, stating that the United States will not heed the 24th and 25th vetoes used by the Soviet Union in the Security Council, but will obtain testimony from Czech politicians in exile in the United States to assist the United Nations organization in investigating the Czech coup in February of this year.</p>
<p>Soviet Representative Gromyko used the veto power twice in the Security Council yesterday to prevent the United Nations investigation. Austin's statement emphasized that Wan Romico's use of the veto power was not enough to eliminate the cause of the investigation and was a complete abuse of the veto power. It pointed out that such investigations were essential, and the United States would not stop providing support for investigations due to Gromyko's opposition. His statement "We will obtain the testimony of Czech politicians in exile in the United States after the February coup in the Czech Republic, and we hope that other governments can do the same." Gromyko used the veto power twice in the Security Council yesterday. The first time was when the Chilean proposal to the Security Council to investigate the Czech coup was voted on. Nine votes were in favor, and two votes were against (the Soviet Union and Ukraine). The Soviet Union's vote against was a veto. The second time was when the vote on whether the Chilean case was applicable to the veto power. Eight votes were in favor of the inapplicability, and the Soviet Union overturned it with the veto power. This was the first time Gromyko had used the veto power since he vetoed Italy's accession to the United Nations on April 30. After Gromyko used the veto power for the second time, Austin stood up and condemned the Soviet Union's attitude in strong terms, and British Representative Cadgan also expressed that Gromyko's two uses of the veto power were making a joke of the San Francisco Charter.</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 24th] Would you like to buy an empire for 500,000 yen? Japan is currently selling one such empire. This tiny country is Higashi-Mazushima Island, which covers an area of one square mile. The island is located one mile north of Rebun Island, where Japanese and American scientists recently observed the solar eclipse. The island's owner, Juichi Fukui, said that countless sea elephants gather near the island every autumn and winter, and the waters around it are rich in herring roe. One of the reasons why the island's owner wants to sell the island at a low price of 500,000 yen is that it is very close to Sakhalin Island in Soviet Russia.</p>

<p>[United Press, Tokyo, 25th] The U.S. Far East Air Forces Command announced today that last Saturday, a four-engine aircraft of British Overseas Airways, flying from Japan to Hong Kong, deviated from its route and was discovered by U.S. fighter planes near Ryukyu Island. Considering it a plane of unknown nationality, it was ordered to change course. The British plane did not comply, so several bursts of machine-gun fire were used to urge its attention. The British plane then turned towards Ryukyu and contacted the U.S. Air Forces Command by radio, proving its nationality, after which it continued flying to Hong Kong. The acting commander of the U.S. Far East Air Forces, Wylde, has formally expressed his apology to the head of the British Liaison Mission in Japan.</p>
<h3 id="e56">Six-Nation Negotiations on the German Question to Face Final Stage; France Intends to Request Military Guarantees from the U.S. <a href="#e56" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c56" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">56</a></h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, London, 25th] The French representative attending the Six-Nation Conference returned to Paris last weekend to confer with French Foreign Minister Bidault and returned to London this morning at 11:00 a.m. to continue discussions on the German question. It is reported that the final stage of the negotiations will begin tomorrow.</p>
<p>[United Press, London, 24th] It is heard that France will request the United States to guarantee military assistance to the Western European Union as a condition for supporting the American reconstruction of German industry. It is heard that the French delegation participating in the Six-Nation Conference has obtained the support of Belgium, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg, and has agreed in principle to the establishment of an independent government in West Germany and the expansion of its economic autonomy. However, it also requests the United States to guarantee military assistance in the event that any country in the Western European Alliance is attacked.</p>
<h3 id="e57">Soviet Union Closely Watches Developments of the Conference <a href="#e57" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c57" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">57</a></h3>
<p>[Reuters, Berlin, 24th] German political figures close to the Soviet military government stated that Soviet Army Commander-in-Chief in Germany Sokolovsky will return to Moscow with his main advisors to consult with the Soviet government after the results of the Six-Nation Conference in London discussing the German question are announced. Marshal Sokolovsky has been in contact with Moscow regarding the daily announcements of the conference since its beginning. Sources familiar with German affairs believe that if the communique of the London Conference to be issued this weekend contains an indication that a West German government will be established, the Soviet Union will most likely reapply great pressure in Berlin, forcing Britain, the United States, and France to withdraw from Berlin and preparing for the establishment of an East German state. These sources point out that the so-called Berlin Crisis has not ended, and the current lull in Soviet pressure is due to the ambiguity of the resolutions of the London Conference. If Sokolovsky's departure for Moscow closely follows the publication of the London Conference communique, the most serious tensions between the Eastern and Western powers regarding the German question are expected to be revealed.</p>

<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] London, 25th Broadcast. Today, British Foreign Secretary Bevin met with U.S. Ambassador to Britain Douglas for the third time in four days to discuss the Palestine issue. A spokesman for the British Foreign Office told reporters that Britain and the United States are discussing common steps to seek a solution to the Palestine issue. It is expected that Bevin will soon return to the House of Commons to issue a statement.</p>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] London, 25th Broadcast: Cairo news. Today, representatives of five Arab countries held a meeting to discuss the UN's ceasefire appeal. It is generally believed that the possibility of Arab countries accepting this appeal is very small. The fate of Jerusalem is still undecided. The New City is still in the hands of Jewish forces. Jordanian troops launched a fierce attack today, but were repelled. If there is a ceasefire at the present time, the Jewish side will still be able to retain the New City of Jerusalem. The Arab side's demand is that the Jewish army lay down its arms and surrender unconditionally.</p>
<p>[U.S. Information Service, Lake Success, 24th] At the request of the Arab countries, the United Nations Security Council tonight extended the deadline for the ceasefire appeal in Palestine by 48 hours. Representatives of Syria, Egypt, and Lebanon notified the Security Council that the Arab countries involved in the Jewish-Arab conflict in the Holy Land needed more time to consider the ceasefire appeal. The Security Council did not oppose the extension. This request was approved approximately seven hours after the original ceasefire deadline set by the Security Council expired. The new deadline is 4:00 p.m. Greenwich Mean Time on Wednesday (the 26th) (1:00 a.m. on Thursday, China Coastal Summer Time). Israel has accepted the original ceasefire appeal and is only awaiting the agreement of the Arab side. Syrian representative El-Khouri told the Security Council that the Political Committee of the Arab League would meet in Amman (Transjordan) on the 25th to discuss the UN's ceasefire appeal. He hoped that the Arab side's response would arrive at Lake Success by noon on Wednesday (the 26th). France once again requested the Security Council to take steps to protect the holy sites of Jerusalem from destruction.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 24th] A British Foreign Office spokesman said that Britain has decided to support the Arab countries' request to the Security Council for a 48-hour extension of the ceasefire deadline in Palestine. Britain has strongly urged the Arab countries to accept the ceasefire proposal, but believes that the Arab countries should be given more time for consideration.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 24th] The State Department recently announced that the United States has formally notified all Arab countries, stating that the United States is deeply troubled by the situation in Palestine and earnestly hopes that all Arab countries will accept the Security Council's ceasefire order.</p>

<p>[United Press, Washington, 24th] Lebanon's refusal to release 41 Americans arrested last week while en route to Palestine has caused the State Department to hold meetings all day, but no quick solution has been reached.

The United States will issue a warning and, if necessary, accuse Lebanon before the Security Council, urging it to release the American people. Congressman Seller told the House of Representatives that what is needed is military action rather than diplomatic action. Seller requested the Navy Department to send warships and Marines to Lebanon to urge Lebanon to release the Americans.</p>

As for lifting the arms embargo, the President did not state a definite date, but Weizmann pointed out its urgency, and the President indicated that he shared the same view. Weizmann acknowledged that part of the loan would be used for military purposes, as the Jewish side lacks arms.</p>

<p>[United Press, Cairo, 24th] There were still battles in Jerusalem and other parts of Palestine today, but generally speaking, the scale is gradually decreasing.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 25th] The latest battle situation on the Palestinian fronts is as follows: Jerusalem: More than 1,000 Jews trapped in the Old City of Jerusalem, with 600 killed in the civil war, are still fighting to the death from ruins and underground passages. The Arab forces intend to starve them out, so their advance is very slow.</p>
<p>Jewish forces in the New City of Jerusalem tried again to break into the Old City but failed. In the New City, Arab forces have surrounded the Notre Dame Monastery and are advancing and retreating from the Barklay's Bank under heavy fire. The area around Hebrew University and Hadassah Hospital is very quiet. The Haganah said that the Arab forces have made no progress in the New City. In the village of Rachel, five miles southeast of Jerusalem, Jewish forces repelled a fierce Arab attack and captured a large amount of military supplies. Southern Front: The Haganah admitted that the Jewish area of Yad Mordechai, north of Gaza, was occupied by Egyptian forces after a day of fierce fighting. Jewish planes raided military targets in Majdal, north of Gaza. A Tel Aviv bulletin announced that the city of Jaffa was bombed by Egyptian planes for the first time, and a mosque was hit.

<h3 id="e66">Report on Aid to China by the U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee <a href="#e66" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c66" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">66</a></h3>
<p>[U.S. Information Service, Washington News] The Senate Foreign Relations Committee released its revised report on China on March 30. The summary is as follows:</p>
<p>The future of Asia is closely related to the development of China.</p>
<p>Due to the traditional friendship between our two nations, China's difficulties evoke deep sympathy in the United States, especially at this critical juncture when China is an important part of the anti-communist front.</p>
<p>There are several favorable factors. China is still able to be self-sufficient in food and raw materials. China has a large and valuable labor force. Among the politically conscious people, there is a strong sentiment in favor of a democratic government. China has great achievements and respect for the constructive values of civilization.</p>
<p>On the other hand, China's economy has been greatly damaged by eight years of war against Japan and the subsequent civil war, including the destructive tactics used by the communists. China has never developed a favorable trade balance, and in the past few years, the unfavorable trade balance has clearly worsened. China faces extremely difficult and complex tasks, and the position of American cooperation is not easy to determine. However, the current recommendations are clearly justified by the current facts, and the self-help proposals made by the National Government (see Section 18) are worthy of our cooperation.</p>
<p>(A) Political Environment</p>
<p>Since 1928, the National Government has been controlled by the Kuomintang (Nationalist Party). The party has taken preliminary steps, announcing a constitution and electing a National Assembly, moving towards democracy. At the same time, the goal of the Chinese Communist Party is a totalitarian government. The CCP's propaganda is strongly anti-American, disregarding all American policies and following the Moscow line. China currently seems to have social and political factors and ideals that can expand and increase the political appeal and leadership of the National Government, thereby combating the openly rebellious Communist Party.</p>
<p>In the Sino-Soviet Treaty of August 1945, the Soviet Union pledged to support only the National Government, which is recognized by all countries as the legitimate government of China. The Soviet Union has not provided the National Government with the "material resources" stipulated in the treaty. On the contrary, the Soviet Union removed a large amount of industrial equipment from factories in the Northeast, the value of which is feared to reach as much as 2 billion U.S. dollars. (See Appendix C)</p>
<p>(B) Economic Crisis</p>
<p>Since the defeat of Japan, China's economy has gradually deteriorated. The destruction of transportation has isolated material and consumer centers and ports. There is a food shortage of 2 million tons next year, mostly due to the civil war. The cost of the civil war has increased the government's expenditures, and the rapid inflation hinders production and distribution, and stimulates speculation and hoarding. The amount of paper money issued has increased more than eight times since 1947. In mid-March, the value of the U.S. dollar on the black market was about 450,000 legal tender annually. Seventy percent of the government's expenditures are used for military purposes, and tax revenue is less than one-third of the government's total expenditures. Private individuals in China own about $500 million in gold, foreign exchange, and foreign currency, but the Chinese government finds it extremely difficult to mobilize these resources. Overseas remittances from overseas Chinese have decreased significantly, and China's official foreign exchange reserves are dwindling, so that it will soon be unable to purchase the imports necessary for the basic civilian economy.</p>
<p>Valuable resources, such as coal and food in rural areas, are under Communist control. The stated goal of the CCP is to cause China's economic collapse.</p>
<p>(C) Population and Regions Under CCP Control</p>
<p>According to rough estimates, as of March 15, 1948, the area controlled by the CCP accounted for 25% of the entire China, and the population controlled accounted for 33% of the entire China, about 150 million people.</p>
<p>Due to the fluid nature of military operations and the constant changes in the areas controlled by the Chinese government and the CCP, it is impossible to provide accurate estimates. The strength of the CCP armed forces is estimated as follows: 1.15 million regular troops, 2 million local militia. Approximately six months ago, the Chinese government publicly announced the strength of its armed forces as 3.8 million people.</p>
<p>Previous Aid to China</p>
<p>The State Department submitted the following estimates of previous aid to China to the committee:</p>
<p>Since 1937, U.S. economic, financial, and military assistance to China has been as follows:</p>
<p>Before the Victory over Japan</p>
<p>Export-Import Bank loan of $120 million, 1942 Congressional loan of $500 million, Lend-Lease materials of $849.4 million, totaling $1.4694 billion.</p>
<p>After the Victory over Japan: (Lend-Lease) Military $728 million, Civilian goods loan of $49.6 million, Naval aid $17.7 million, (Surplus materials loan) Foreign Liquidation Commissioner's Office dockyard loan of $4 million, Huaxi loan of $20 million, Maritime Commission loan approved for $16.5 million, Export-Import Bank loan of $82.8 million. (UNRRA) 72% of the American donations used for aid to China (plus freight and insurance) $465.8 million, donations to the UNRRA Custodial Committee materials and funds $4.7 million, American Relief for Foreign Countries program $45.7 million, United Nations International Children's Emergency Fund $2.1 million, totaling $1.4369 billion, total of $2.9063 billion.</p>
<p>Since the sale of some surplus materials is not included in the above total, the State Department supplemented the committee with the following additional figures in its February 19 letter to the Chairman:</p>
<p>The State Department insisted that it was impossible to obtain the total amount of surplus materials transactions, because in some respects, surplus items are still being transferred, and before the transfer work is completed, the total value of the items cannot be accurately determined. Therefore, the above figures are only estimates in some respects.</p>
<p>The Committee agrees that this aid situation further confirms America's fundamental and traditional concern for China's interests. (To be continued)</p>

<h3 id="e67">A Disturbance Caused by Rongjun in Eastern Shanghai; More Than a Dozen Soldiers and Police Wounded or Missing; Police Squad Headquarters Smashed, Losing Five Firearms; Relevant Authorities Conferred All Night on Handling the Aftermath <a href="#e67" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c67" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">67</a></h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] At 7:30 p.m. last night at the intersection of Dinghai Road and Pingliang Road in Yangshupu, a conflict occurred between Rongjun and the police. The situation was serious for a time, causing the surrounding residents to panic. Three police officers from the Yangshupu Police Station, five police officers from the Police Squad, and one naval soldier passing by were injured on the spot. At the same time, the doors, windows, and chairs of the Police Squad headquarters were also smashed. It was later discovered that the police lost four rifles and one handgun during the chaos, and two police officers on duty at the police station were missing. The cause of this unfortunate incident was that four wounded soldiers were dissatisfied with the answers given by the police officers when they asked for directions, which led to the conflict. Later, more than 200 Rongjun from the 20th Wounded Soldiers Hospital on Meizhou Road arrived and smashed the Police Squad headquarters, causing a great uproar. As for the aftermath, a major Zhou, deputy adjutant from the Garrison Headquarters, Wang, company commander of the Military Police, Ye Qiu-shen from the Joint Logistics Supply Bureau, Wang, squad leader of the Police Squad, Ding, instructor of the Wounded Soldiers Hospital, and Wang Wei-zhou, chief of the Yangshupu Police Station, and Gao, deputy chief, conferred all night on how to handle the situation.</p>
<p>The incident originated when Rongjun Wang Feng-ming, after having dinner at the Da Zhonghua Hotel at about 6 p.m. yesterday, was slightly intoxicated and, while passing the Jianguo Theater on Dinghai Road, entered the theater on a whim. He happened to meet his companions Luo Jin-tang, Ji De-chang, and Han Chang-de. After sitting for a while, the four of them got up to return to the 20th Wounded Soldiers Hospital on Meizhou Road. When they arrived at the intersection of Dinghai Road and Pingliang Road, they met police officer Zhang Qing-tao and asked where they could take a streetcar to Meizhou Road. Zhang replied that because he was not a police officer on duty at the police station, he did not know the details. The Rongjun thought that the answer was unhelpful and deliberately made things difficult, and a conflict arose in the language. Then, they used their iron canes to beat Zhang Qing-tao. At that time, police officers Li Jun and Zhao Zi-ying from a nearby police booth witnessed this and came out to mediate, but they were also attacked by the Rongjun. Li's left forehead was cracked for more than an inch and he fell to the ground injured, while Zhao was injured in the waist. Many passersby who were watching felt indignant and helped the police officers take the four Rongjun who caused the trouble to the Yangshupu Police Station. Unexpectedly, at this time, the 20th Wounded Soldiers Hospital learned that four Rongjun had been detained by the police station, so they gathered more than 200 Rongjun and set off to rescue them. The team marched mightily and aggressively. When passing the headquarters of the First Squad of the First Battalion of the Second Police Brigade on Pingliang Road and Ningwu Road, the Rongjun mistook it for a police station and rushed in. Li Guo-mei, the guard on duty at the gate, was the first to bear the brunt and was beaten and injured. The police were caught off guard and did not know where the disaster came from. In a short time, doors, windows, tables, and chairs had been destroyed. Squad leader Zhou Gui-sheng, in order to prevent the situation from escalating, immediately ordered the police officers not to fire and went out to inquire about the reason from the Rongjun. However, in the chaos, he and police officers Jia Hong-ji, Wang Zhi-gao, and Yao Jie were also beaten and injured. At this point, the Rongjun dispersed in a hubbub. Before leaving, they kidnapped Zhou, Jia, and Wang. Afterwards, the police整理內部始又發現短少步槍四枝及手槍一枝, At the same time, the Yangshupu Police Station also found that Lu Hao, the police officer on duty at the Ningguo Road station, and Ka Jin-kang, the guard on duty at the Meizhou Road police station, were missing after the Rongjun returned to the hospital. In addition, one unfortunate person was accidentally injured. When the Rongjun were causing trouble, naval soldier Jiang Yong-zhong happened to be passing by. Because he was wearing a yellow uniform, he was mistaken for a police officer by the Rongjun, and his head and chest were beaten. All the injured were sent to the Police Hospital for treatment, but police officer Li Jun's injuries were so severe that his life was in danger.</p>
<h3 id="e68">City Finances Approaching Serious Stage; Accelerating Tax Collection; Piloting Simplified Tax Collection <a href="#e68" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c68" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">68</a></h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] To understand the city's financial revenue and expenditure situation, the reporter visited the director of the Municipal Finance Bureau yesterday. He was told that since April, the cost of living index for civil servants has been adjusted monthly instead of quarterly, and expenditures have suddenly increased sharply. The total expenditure for May was about 630 billion yuan. However, in recent months, the collection of all taxable taxes has been stepped up, so the difficult situation in May can be barely overcome. However, the revenue and expenditure for June are feared to be impossible to balance. The only remedy is to borrow funds from relevant financial institutions to make up for the deficit.</p>
<p>In the face of the current difficult situation, the only way is to urge and accelerate the collection of all taxable taxes. For example, the business tax, which accounts for 40% of the total tax revenue, has collected 70-80% of the amount due in spring. On the other hand, tax revenue is being rectified, and simplified tax collection methods are planned to be piloted. Under the existing tax collection method, merchants must declare their business turnover tax. After the bureau reviews it, it issues a payment slip, and merchants pay taxes based on it. Time, procedures, and manpower cannot avoid waste. The simplified method is to first determine the standard quarterly business turnover of the city's 70,000 tax collection targets. This will be used as the base, and the tax payable in each subsequent quarter will be calculated based on the rate of increase or decrease in prices in each quarter, without the need for review and other procedures. The determination of the standard business turnover will be done by the Finance Bureau with reference to the past declarations of each merchant. After dividing the total business turnover of each industry, the trade associations will be responsible for dividing the business turnover of each member merchant and sending a list of base numbers to the bureau. The Finance Bureau will use this as the basis for collecting the quarterly business tax. This simplified tax collection principle was once discussed by a small review committee composed of four institutions: the Municipal Government, the Finance Bureau, the Municipal Council, and the Municipal Chamber of Commerce. The second small group meeting will be held soon, and there will be some conclusions after the meeting. It is believed that simplified tax collection can rectify tax revenue, but it is still being piloted. Those in various industries who are dissatisfied with the new method can still declare and pay taxes according to the original tax collection method.</p>
<h3 id="e69">Estimated Increase in This Month's Index by About 40% <a href="#e69" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c69" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">69</a></h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The Municipal Government will finalize the price survey for the last week of May for the cost of living index for workers and staff members in this city, and then begin statistical compilation. It will be released after the review committee is convened at 10:00 a.m. on May 31. According to Zhang Zong-meng, director of statistics of the Municipal Government, who is responsible for the compilation, the increase in the staff member index will be greater than that of workers this month because of the large increase in the price of movies, public utilities, and cigarettes. According to relevant estimates, the cost of living index for this month will increase by about 40% compared to last month. Estimated to be nine permanent directors.</p>

<h3 id="e79">Stall Vendors at Four Major Railway Stations Petition to Overturn Negotiation Records; Railway Bureau Expresses Determination Not to Accept <a href="#e79" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c79" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">79</a></h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper News] The Railway Bureau decided last year to take back the stalls at the four major railway stations of Suzhou, Wuxi, Changzhou, and Zhenjiang and operate them itself. It has repeatedly consulted with representatives of the stall vendors at each station, and on March 5th of this year, both parties agreed to record stipulations that the vendors would be transferred to other smaller stations or reassigned as railway bureau cleaners. Those who were young and met the railway's standards were selected to become service staff at the stations, and were required to cease operations by March 15th. The Railway Bureau also dispatched trained service staff to the four stations to replace them. On the 22nd of this month, over thirty representatives of stall vendors from the four stations suddenly came to Shanghai to petition the Railway Bureau, requesting permission to maintain the current system and continue operations, and their attitude was firm. The Railway Bureau believed that someone must be directing them from behind the scenes. In order to maintain railway order and prevent the situation from escalating, the Police Department temporarily detained Tang Guoan and 17 others who were leading the petition. The issue was later resolved through the guidance of Huang Dexi, section chief of the Police Department. The Railway Bureau issued a statement yesterday regarding this incident, stating that the bureau has been considerate of the vendors' livelihoods during the business restructuring, and has made appropriate arrangements. The vendors' livelihoods are no longer an issue. If they do not comply with the decision recorded, they will be removed from the roster and dismissed, and no leniency will be shown.</p>

<h3 id="e98">Stray Dogs in Cages Await Their Final Fate; Those Unclaimed by the Deadline Will Be Put to Death by Gas <a href="#e98" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c98" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">98</a></h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Special] Behind the Jiangxi Road Police Precinct is a "dog prison," where over a hundred dogs are kept. They were captured on the streets by the police's dog-catching team and are awaiting their owners to claim them. Stray dogs without licenses are put to death by gas.</p>
<p>A reporter visited the "dog prison" yesterday. In a dark, damp, dirty, and narrow little room, over a hundred dogs were locked up. As soon as you stepped through the door, there was a foul odor. The dogs were kept in square wire cages and barked wildly when they saw someone enter. Many owners can quickly identify their beloved dogs by their barks.</p>
<p>The dogs in the prison are fed a thin beef porridge once a day. The "dog prison" authorities buy 1.1 million yuan worth of beef every day and cook it into two large pots of thin porridge, which is fed to the dogs at 9:00 AM. They are given tap water once at 4:00 PM. The caged dogs are mostly thin and bony due to malnutrition. Fortunately, domestic dogs are sure to be reclaimed by their owners in a short period of time, while stray dogs are destined to die sooner or later.</p>
<p>Selling Dog Skin To Subsidize Food Costs Once a dog is captured, licensed dogs are kept for seven days, and unlicensed dogs are kept for four days. If no one claims them within the deadline, they are considered stray dogs and are either put to death or given away. The place where stray dogs are put to death is a metal box about five feet wide and two feet deep, which can hold over ten dogs at a time. It is equipped with a gas pipe and can kill the dogs within three minutes. After being poisoned by the gas, the dog's entire body turns black. The meat cannot be eaten, but the dog skin can be sold for money. The price of each dog skin is equivalent to about one sheng of rice, and the income from the dog skins is used to subsidize the food costs of the dog-catching team members.</p>
<p>There are twenty staff members at the "dog prison," and the person in charge is Zhang Jing. The dog-catching team has four groups, each with four people. They all go out every day and catch an average of forty to fifty dogs per day. There are also two clerical staff who are responsible for cleaning the "dog prison." The "dog prison" must be scrubbed twice a day and sprayed with a large amount of disinfectant, otherwise it is simply impossible to enter.</p>
<p>Dizzy and Head Spinning, They Surrender</p>
<p>Wang Jinyou, the leader of the dog-catching team, has been catching dogs for over forty years. He shared his experience with reporters: "The best way to catch a dog is to grab its hind legs, then pick it up and make it spin around vigorously. This will make it dizzy and head spinning, and it will surrender." He said that they catch dogs by hand, and sometimes they are bitten if they are not careful. Over the decades, they have gotten used to it and don't even consider it an issue. He held out his hand to show the reporter, covered with scars. He said that it would heal on its own in a day or two, but he was afraid of rabid dogs, which required injections if they bit.</p>
<p>With a Compassionate Heart</p>
<p>For them, catching dogs has long become commonplace, but the dog catchers have a compassionate heart. They hope that every dog can have a way out. There are always twenty or thirty owners going to claim their dogs every day. At the same time, many hospitals write to them asking for dogs for experimentation, such as the Pasteur Institute, the Southeast Police Academy, and St. John's University, which need about twenty dogs per week. In addition, there are many people who come to the "dog prison" to beg for dogs. They are willing to give away the overdue stray dogs without any conditions. They said, "Finding a way to live for stray dogs is like doing a good deed. We will never use gas unless we have no other choice (that is, when there are too many stray dogs and the dog prison can't hold them)."</p>

<h3 id="e104">Price Limits and Collection Efforts Combined, Rice Prices Started to Fall Yesterday, Edible Oil, Flour, Staple Foods, and Miscellaneous Grains Also Experienced a Consistent Decline <a href="#e104" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c104" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">104</a></h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] According to relevant authorities, the reasons for the soaring rice prices in recent days are due to rising prices in the production areas, the busy farming season, the floods in Hunan, and the cabinet reshuffle. After Mayor Wu strictly limited the retail price to no more than 6 million yuan per stone and sold 6,000 stones in the market every day, the prices had slightly fallen on the day before yesterday. Yesterday, Wuxi and other places also fell back to 6.12 million yuan. In addition, the water level in Hunan has begun to fall, people's minds are stable, and it is generally observed that after the new cabinet is formally established, prices may fall further.</p>
<p>The price of rice distributed to each person in this city must be calculated at 95% of the average market price of the last five days of the previous month, according to the Sino-US agreement. The price of rice rose sharply this month. If calculated according to this formula, the price of rice distributed in June will be much higher than the 3.5 million yuan per stone in May, which will stimulate the market and will inevitably cause serious consequences. The authorities are paying close attention to this and are in consultation with the US-China Relief Team.</p>
<p>Yesterday, under the strict enforcement of price limits by the authorities and the continued sale of rice by the Regulation Committee, the off-market price began to fall. The prices of all other commodities consistently weakened, and the cargo owners became more willing to sell. Moreover, due to the price limit, sales were difficult, and few people inquired. The initial asking price for early japonica rice was 6.5 million yuan, but due to slow sales, it was further reduced to 6.4 million yuan. The price of early rice was 6.3 million yuan, a decrease of 300,000 and 350,000 yuan, respectively, and transactions were very rare. The amount of rice sold yesterday was still 6,000 stones, and the registered arrival of goods in the two markets was 3,834 stones.</p>
<p>Due to the excessive rise in flour prices in recent days, the news of the fall in rice prices spread, and people became uneasy. Cargo owners were eager to sell, and there was a chorus of selling. Buyers dared not enter the market rashly, and for a time, there were few sellers. Old "Che Bing Chuan" flour fell from 2.18 million to 2.1 million yuan. The price of flour sold by the China Trust Bureau actually increased by 100,000 yuan to 2.05 million yuan, which had no stimulation to people's minds. "Hong Feng" flour fell into the price range of the flour sold, at 2.03 million yuan, and "Yun Cheng" flour was at 2.05 million yuan. Iron skin was down by 130,000 yuan, and wheat fell sharply by 400,000 yuan.</p>
<p>The price of miscellaneous grains fell like dragons without a leader, all heading down. Buyers were disinterested, while cargo owners were eager to sell at high prices, but there were few buyers. The initial price of yellow beans fell by 200,000 yuan, and the final price of broad beans was 3.35 million yuan, a decrease of 350,000 yuan. Corn was available for sale but lacked buyers, falling by 200,000 yuan. Red sorghum fell by 100,000 yuan. There were few transactions in selected green sorghum, and the market also fell by 100,000 yuan. The bean brokers were hesitant, with prices falling by 200,000 to 300,000 yuan. Sesame fell by about 300,000 yuan, and raw peanuts fell sharply by 2 million yuan.</p>
<p>Edible oil fell from its peak, and cargo owners, aware that various grains had fallen, also competed to sell. Oil factories also offered oil, and the prices of various off-market goods were low, with few buyers. "Ji Tong" raw oil was 16.05 million yuan, a sharp drop of 1.5 million yuan. "Da You" bean oil opened at 15 million yuan and fell to 14.75 million yuan, also down by 1.45 million yuan. Raw vegetable oil and other oils fell by 1.5 million yuan across the board, reaching about 10%. Small "Che" sesame oil was down by 1.2 million yuan, and the initial price of bean cakes was the most chaotic, with many buyers at 1.5 million yuan. The market later rebounded slightly, to 1.52 million yuan, a decrease of about 130,000 to 140,000 yuan.</p>

<p>Remarks from person in charge of the Gold Control Bureau.</p>
<p>[Ta Kung Pao News] The decision to restrict the use of same-day checks will be implemented on June 1, in accordance with the regulations of the Ministry of Finance.</p>
<p>It is learned that the Shanghai Industrial Association sent representatives to the Gold Control Bureau yesterday morning, requesting that the restrictions on the use of checks be relaxed for legitimate factories. To this end, the reporter specially visited the person in charge of the bureau. According to him, prohibiting the use of checks on the same day is intended to prevent customers from issuing blank checks indiscriminately, which is actually beneficial to the industrial sector. Moreover, promissory notes, certified checks, and bills of exchange can all be used. It is not difficult for the industrial sector to use its funds on the same day. In addition, the industrial sector can enter into overdraft or pledge agreements with banks. Those who have such agreements will not be subject to the restriction that same-day checks cannot be used. Banks may not use this as an excuse to reject checks.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper, Wuxi, 25th] The County Council believes that the price of mulberry leaves has soared to 2.2 million per load, while the price of fresh cocoons is only 21 million.

<p>The firewood market situation is that there is a shortage of goods in the producing areas, the supply is not abundant, and the expenses such as transportation costs are huge, which increases the cost. People are excited, and trading is not weak. The opening market price of the association is very popular. Chestnut firewood jumps up by 130,000 per load, rising to 480,000 yuan. Miscellaneous firewood rises by 120,000, pushing up to 400,000 yuan. Pine firewood is 320,000 yuan, and dry firewood is 480,000 yuan, a sharp increase of 35% compared to the end of last week.</p>
<p>The charcoal market is selling well because the price of coal balls has risen and the price of kerosene is expensive, so the market is also rising.

<h3 id="e115">Stabilization Fund Remains Temporarily Unchanged, The Issue of Retention and Abolition is Currently Out of the Question, A Decision Can Only be Made After the New Cabinet is Formed <a href="#e115" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c115" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">115</a></h3>
<p>The former Governor of the Central Bank, Mr. Zhang Jia'ao, hosted a banquet at his private residence yesterday afternoon to entertain Mr. Chen Guangfu, Chairman of the Foreign Exchange Fund Stabilization Committee, and members Mr. Shen Xirui, Mr. Kong Shi'e, and the newly appointed Governor of the Central Bank, Mr. Yu Hongjun, and Deputy Governor Mr. Liu Gongyun. During the banquet, Mr. Chen and Mr. Shen reported to Mr. Yu Hongjun on the foreign exchange income and expenditure during Mr. Zhang Jia'ao's tenure as Governor, as well as the import and export trade situation in recent years. Mr. Yu also expressed his firm retention of Mr. Chen and Mr. Shen's resignation. Mr. Yu also believes that everything at present is of a transitional nature, strictly speaking, because the government reorganization has not yet been completed. The retention or abolition of the Foreign Exchange Fund Stabilization Committee can only be determined after the new cabinet is formed. Therefore, he expressed his firm retention of the two gentlemen's request for resignation. According to general observation, if Mr. Chen Guangfu resigns as Chairman of the Stabilization Committee, this task may be taken over by Mr. Yu himself, or by one of the two Deputy Governors of the Central Bank. Mr. Shen Xirui's position as Director of the Business Bureau will not be changed for the time being. As for the abolition of the Foreign Exchange Fund Stabilization Committee, although there are rumors outside, this saying is premature before the government reorganization is completed. However, there is probably no problem that Mr. Yu will make some changes in detail in the future regarding the foreign exchange control policy. Mr. Yu has publicly stated at a press conference the day before that this issue will be improved at any time as needed.</p>
<p>It was also reported that Mr. Yu Hongjun, Minister of Finance and Governor of the National Bank, spent the entire morning at the National Bank dealing with official business, meeting with the heads of various departments, listening to the progress of the work and its overview, and also meeting with Mr. Li Du, Director General of the Customs Administration, because Mr. Li had recently been sent to Macau and signed the Sino-Macau Customs Agreement with the authorities on the 20th. In the afternoon, Mr. Yu attended the Board of Directors meeting of the Bank of Communications, and took a trip to Jinjing in the evening to report to the Central Government on the transition process.</p>

<h3 id="e117">Final Meeting of the National Games Organizing Group. Preparatory Committee Scheduled to Conclude on the 10th. Advertising Results Disappointingly Poor, Causing Great Disappointment to Hao Gengsheng. <a href="#e117" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c117" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">117</a></h3>
<p>The Seventh National Games Preparatory Committee, as the Games have been closed for ten days, urgently needs to be sorted out and concluded. A final joint meeting of all groups was held yesterday (the 25th) from 9:00 AM at the City Stadium on Shaanxi South Road to discuss various outstanding matters. More than 30 group leaders and deputy leaders attended, chaired by Chief Secretary Hao. Each group reported on the income and expenditure of funds and the general situation of the work. The main points are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Report from the Accounting Group: As of the 24th, the Sanitation, Propaganda, and Accounting groups had completed the reimbursement procedures with the Accounting Division. The Sanitation Group's expenditures were more than 300 million yuan less than the budget, and the Propaganda Group's expenditures were more than 540 million yuan less than the budget, returning a surplus of more than 158.9 million yuan. The Accounting Group's expenditures were also less than the budget. The reimbursement of other groups has not yet been completed. As of the 24th, the total income of the Games was 37.006468485 billion yuan, including 31.006427 billion yuan in ticket revenue (payment for long-term tickets has not yet been received), 4 billion yuan in subsidies from the Ministry of Education, and 2 billion yuan in stall rental fees. Total expenditures were 46.002660075 billion yuan, resulting in a deficit of 8.99619159 billion yuan. The above figures are calculated based on the income and expenditure reported by each group. The total income and expenditure must be settled after the reimbursements from each group are collected.</p>
<p>(2) Report from the Transportation Group: Vehicle ticket revenue is approximately 3 billion to 3.3 billion yuan. Once the settlement is cleared, it can be reported to the Games.</p>
<p>(3) Report from the Sanitation Group: There are still a large number of surplus medicines, which are currently stored in the Municipal Fourth Hospital and will be handed over to the person in charge of the Games for receipt.</p>
<p>(4) Reports from other groups: In addition to the Guard Group returning a surplus of more than 1 million yuan to the Games, most expenditures exceeded the budget. The exact figures have not yet been reimbursed to the Accounting Group.</p>
<p>(5) Report from the Advertising Committee: The total advertising revenue was 4.9 billion yuan. After deducting various expenses and advertising commissions totaling 2.2 billion yuan, the net income was 2.7 billion yuan. Once collected, it will be reported to the Games. Advertising revenue is divided into the following categories: (1) Advertising board revenue of 3 billion yuan, (2) Special advertising revenue of 1.1 billion yuan, including 100 million yuan for the Xinwen Bao balloon and 1 billion yuan for Coca-Cola advertising (the four-sided Coca-Cola advertising flags most noticeable in the stadium, along with Coca-Cola advertising in the swimming pool and gymnasium, cost a total of 650 million yuan, and the remaining 350 million yuan was for radio broadcasting fees), (3) Radio broadcasting report revenue of 500 million yuan (excluding 350 million yuan for Coca-Cola), (4) Advertising revenue published in the Games program of 300 million yuan, totaling 4.9 billion yuan. Finally, Chief Secretary Hao stated in a painful tone: "The most criticized aspect of this Games by all parties was the four-sided Coca-Cola advertising flags hanging high in the four corners of the track and field stadium. However, I was not aware of this advertisement beforehand. Until the day before the opening of the Games, I did not know that the tower-shaped flagpole frame was used to hang Coca-Cola advertising flags, and mistakenly thought it was built by the radio station. Regarding this matter, I have been deeply stimulated spiritually. During the Games, I have endured it all along because I did not want to shirk responsibility, but today I must solemnly declare this to everyone." Finally, he expressed his deep gratitude to all parties and colleagues in the preparatory committee for their enthusiastic assistance during the preparation and holding of the Games.</p>
<p>At yesterday's meeting, two items were also decided regarding the expedited conclusion of the preparatory committee: (1) The committee must be fully concluded by June 10th, and the reimbursement of each group must be completed as soon as possible. (2) The remaining materials handled and received by each group must be returned to the Games before June 10th, and the handling method will be submitted to the Standing Committee for decision.</p>
<h3 id="e118">British Naval Football Team to Play Donghua Again Today at 5 PM at Yiyuan Stadium <a href="#e118" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c118" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">118</a></h3>
<p>The joint football team of the British Navy's London and Alert ships made their debut a few days ago, defeating the Qingbai team 2-1 at Yiyuan. However, in the last seven minutes, they were penalized with two penalty kicks in a row, resulting in a 2-3 defeat. The team's second match will be against Donghua at Yiyuan at 5 PM today. Tickets are still available in two categories: 60,000 yuan and 100,000 yuan, and will be sold at the City Stadium from 3 PM.</p>
<p>The British Navy's first defeat was a pity, as they led all the way but were defeated in the last few minutes, and the victory or defeat was not due to the game. Although the team's skills are not very refined, their height and strength are great, and their footwork is strong, which is appreciated by all. Central defender Skagen and goalkeeper Weeks are both considered solid. Center forward Morley is exceptionally fierce and a powerful threat, which Donghua must guard against.</p>
<p>Since the departure of Bonnie from Donghua, the last line of defense has felt insecure, and Lin Gen's recent situation is also not good. Chen Jiawan alone seems to be carrying a heavy burden. The stability of the veteran Tan in the central defense line, the ruthlessness of Hannibal, coupled with the assistance of Yu Qia and others, should be able to hold firm. If Sun Laojin can play in the front line, with Gai Xiatixian on the right wing, Han Longhai in the center, and Li "Nephew" on the left and right wings, the five tigers will come out together, and the offensive will be strong. It is expected that they will directly attack the yellow dragon. The lineups of both sides are as follows:</p>
<p>British Navy</p>
<p>Weeks, Mao Shiman, Tan Yiti, Mei Quishi, Skagens, Lin Mann, Ford, Xia Shiqi, Morleyfen, Nolan, Evans</p>
<p>Donghua</p>
<p>Chen Huimin, Chen Jiawan, Zhang Lin'gen, Hannibal, Yu Qiaxing, Li Yao, Sun Jinshun, Han Longhai, Xia Tixian, Chen Mingzhe</p>
<p>The Black and White Third Game Tonight Meets Renyu</p>
<p>7 PM at the City Stadium</p>
<p>The Philippine Black and White basketball team has won two consecutive games since arriving in Shanghai. They will play their third game tonight against the Renyu team of this city. It will be held at the City Stadium on Shaanxi South Road at 7 PM. Tickets are 100,000 yuan upstairs and 200,000 yuan downstairs. The Siwei Boy Scouts will continue to maintain order.</p>
<p>The Black and White team has returned this time, first defeating the Tianjin District and then defeating the Oil Team. All the players can exert their excellent skills. In order to maintain their winning streak, they will be able to cooperate and perform wonderfully.</p>
<p>[Black and White] Cai Lianfa, Wang Yiyuan (leader), Qiu Qinghai (secretary), Fu Yongxin (captain), Qiu Qingtong, Guo Guoye, Shi Rongrui, Xu Yinzhen, Ye Kexi, Zhuang Yusheng, Shen Renshou, You Liangtan, Lin Ziyi, Xiao Huatuo, Lin Zhude.</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, Hong Kong, 25th] After the frequent occurrence of missing schoolchildren, although the education and police authorities here have conducted investigations, the reunion of missing schoolchildren with their parents has not yet been realized.

It is said that all the missing students were deceived by communist bandits active here, left their families, and went to the communist-occupied areas near the border to participate in "Little Devil Team" training. According to reports here, the mother of one of the missing students, Pan Shuliang, sent someone to venture into the communist-occupied area of Wushiyan in Bao'an County to investigate and found Pan Shuzhen mixed in the so-called "Little Devil Team" receiving training such as mountain climbing and maneuvering.

<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] This time, the Yunnan Province delegation to the National Games includes only the women's basketball team. They faced many difficulties: initially, the Department of Education lacked funds, delaying the selection of representatives. They intentionally postponed it until close to the Games' opening, then announced they did not plan to participate. The Shui Zhen team raised funds themselves and rushed to Shanghai by plane. However, the registration deadline had passed the day before, leaving no room for flexibility, so they were unable to participate in the competition. This long journey was in vain, which was quite embarrassing for these girls. After arriving in Shanghai, they first stayed in the East Asia Physical Education School girls' dormitory inside the sports field. The entire team huddled on the floor in a small corner. After the closing ceremony, they had to move out. Fortunately, they were introduced by a fellow townsman and moved to the Taixing Road Women's Rehabilitation Center, living like refugees. The team members are all teachers from Kunming City. Their vacation is coming to an end, and their funds are almost exhausted. They urgently want to return home, but recently, plane tickets from Shanghai to Kunming have been reserved for National Assembly representatives. Ordinary passengers will not be able to board until the 8th to 15th of next month at the earliest. During this free time, Shui Zhen hopes to play several friendly matches with the various teams staying in Shanghai for mutual learning and benefit. However, what makes the Yunnan girls most uncomfortable is that their heroic skills have no place to be used, and they cannot find anyone to play against. The Shui Zhen team has played four friendly matches in Shanghai this time. The first was against the Hubei representative team, the second was against the Nanjing representative team, the third was against the Shanghai women's basketball powerhouse, the Frontline Team, and the day before yesterday, they played a warm-up match against Tianjin before their game. They had originally arranged to play against the Green Team, the women's basketball champion of the National Games, but the Green Team said they needed to rest, so they temporarily replaced them with the Minli Girls' High School. Although Shui Zhen won every game, they dare not be complacent. It is generally believed that it is commendable for a frontier team to have such skills. They most want to play a game with the Green Team, whom they have long admired, regardless of winning or losing, they always want to gain more experience in basketball skills. However, the Green Team has been slow to agree, perhaps because they think that if they win, it is to be expected, but if they lose, it would damage their reputation. Others such as the Philippines, Fujian, and Indonesia are also unwilling to condescend. The Shui Zhen team's disregard for difficulties and their perseverance and spirit this time in Shanghai are all admirable. We hope that the Green Team and other strong teams staying in Shanghai can, in the spirit of sportsmanship, give them sympathy and give them a rare opportunity to compete. We, as fans, also hope to be able to enjoy an exciting match as soon as possible. Our correspondent in England.</p>

<p>The purpose of this dispatch is to introduce to the people of our country an important school for the study of social sciences: the London School of Economics. But before introducing this school, I would like to say a few words about some of the special circumstances of British universities.</p>
<p>British universities have several fundamental differences from those in China. First, the universities here are all private and there are no national universities, although private universities also receive economic assistance from the state, but in the end, their nature is different from that of national universities. Second, not only does Britain not have national universities, but also the Ministry of Education does not interfere with the internal affairs of universities. The universities themselves become autonomous legal entities, so there are no regulations such as "University Laws." Economic assistance is issued by the Ministry of Finance, and does not constitute a kind of "interference" because of the assistance. The British "Education Act" only stipulates the "laws" for education at all levels and types other than universities. Third, all universities have gradually developed, so each school has its own "tradition," and even each college has its own "tradition," emphasizing its own "tradition" rather than uniformity. Although the situations of the various schools have some similarities, their differences are also very large.</p>
<p>The original English name of the London School of Economics is London School of Economics and Political Science. It is one of the several colleges of the University of London. The University of London was established in 1800, and currently the University of London includes dozens of different units. These units were established at different times and gradually joined the University of London. Therefore, although the names of the various units can be called "colleges" in Chinese, in fact, the original English names of the various units all retain their original names, either called College, or School, or Institute. Some units, although called colleges, are internally divided into several colleges. The names of the various colleges also do not have a uniform standard. Some are self-explanatory and one can tell what discipline they are, such as the London School of Economics and the London School of Education. Others have different names, such as "King's College" and "Queen's College." The departments of the various colleges may be the same, for example, the London School of Economics, King's College, and "University College" all have law departments. The various colleges are not at the same address. Although the University of London has uniform regulations for certain methods, it may be said that the various colleges retain their own "tradition" in many more matters. By the way, "college" at the University of London still has somewhat the nature of a "college" in a Chinese university. At Oxford and Cambridge, the college is just a dormitory or a "living unit," which is completely different from a "college" in a Chinese university.</p>
<p>The organization of the school, in terms of vertical organization, includes both undergraduate and graduate programs. In terms of horizontal organization, it includes disciplines such as politics, economics, society, humanities, and law. However, it does not have the distinct departments like Chinese universities. Now I will give a brief description of its main content, which may also give some idea of the general situation of British universities. First, let's talk about the undergraduate program.</p>
<p>Twenty-Eight Weeks of Classes Per Year with No Credit System or Guidance Counselor System</p>
<p>The undergraduate program takes three years to complete. Rather than saying it is divided into departments, it is better to say it is divided into several types of bachelor's degrees. There are only three exams in three years. The first is the entrance exam, the second can be said to be the mid-term exam, held at the end of the first academic year, and the third is the graduation exam, held at the end of the third academic year. Each academic year is divided into three terms. The first term is from October to December, the second term is from January to March, and the third term is from April to June. This system of dividing the year into three terms is the same for all British universities, but the start and end dates of each term are not exactly the same. Generally, the various colleges of the University of London have about twenty-eight weeks of classes per year, with each term averaging about nine weeks. (Cambridge and Oxford have about twenty-four weeks of classes per year.) Therefore, there are many holidays each year. The first thing to do upon entering school is naturally to pay tuition. The school only charges tuition (room and board are self-funded), which costs about 30 pounds per year. Although the school has a small number of dormitories and a dining hall for all teachers and students, these are "paid separately." Because there are few dormitories and many students, most students live off-campus. This is also a very common situation in British universities. Although Oxford and Cambridge have dormitories, they are not cheaper than off-campus housing, so many students still live off-campus. After entering school, naturally, it is time for classes. There is no system of "credits" in classes. Each student has a guidance counselor. You can consult your guidance counselor about what you plan to study and what classes to take. Of course, because of the mid-term and graduation exams, the classes that each person takes are generally related to what they are tested on. The subjects of the exam depend on the degree you are pursuing. Some are required, some are elective. The subjects tested may not be exactly the same as the classes taken in terms of name. Usually, the subjects tested have a wider scope. One subject tested can sometimes include several classes that should be taken. The mid-term exam is very selective. Those who fail will be expelled unless they have special permission.</p>

<h3 id="e137">A Soldier <a href="#e137" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c137" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">137</a></h3>
<p>— By Mu Tiyi, Xinjiang; Translated by Shi Tianxing</p>
<p>Mr. Hai Bi'er, the director-general of the Xinjiang Song and Dance Troupe, came to Shanghai a few days ago. In a conversation, he mentioned a Uyghur writer named Mu Tiyi. At that time, we wanted to find an opportunity to read this writer's works. Later, we heard that Mr. Mu Tiyi was elected as a representative from Xinjiang to the National Assembly and had come to Beijing for a meeting. However, Nanjing is, after all, the political center, and few people seem to have noticed this writer who is famous in the Soviet Union and our country's border regions.</p>
<p>This time, Mr. Shi Tianxing translated this "A Soldier" from the Esperanto version of "New Masses" published in the Soviet Union, allowing us to read a short story by this National Assembly representative and Xinjiang writer. This is truly a happy event.</p>
<p>It is said that Mr. Mu Tiyi came from a working-class background and has traveled to many places. This article is probably a work from his time in the military during World War II. (Editor)</p>
<p>Night was gradually unfolding. As this soldier followed the small path in the forest, walking towards a vast cultivated field, the scene of an approaching storm added to the darkness and horror of the forest—he immediately thought of the descriptions he had heard, and he remembered that the house with ivy climbing on the roof was the one he was looking for. He quickly walked across the cultivated field; as the first drops of rain imprinted themselves in the dust on the road, he knocked on the door. The door opened immediately.</p>
<p>"Is Mr. Malai here?" he asked.</p>
<p>"Dad is not home; he went to town." A lively voice answered, "If you want to see his assistant, he lives nearby."</p>
<p>A young girl appeared on the doorstep, followed by a large dog that barked incessantly. She immediately ordered it to stop barking. Judging from her appearance, she was probably sixteen or seventeen years old. In her gray clothes, her tall and fully developed body could be seen. Her intelligent face still retained her childhood innocence. But her eyes were unusually dignified, steady, and silent. With delicate hands, she smoothed the black, fluffy curly hair from her brow.</p>
<p>"I originally intended to speak with Mr. Malai," the soldier stammered.</p>
<p>Glancing at her, he couldn't help but feel shy. She looked at him in surprise, finding that his apparent shyness was inconsistent with his tall stature, lively manner, and bold, straightforward style.</p>
<p>"If I could come again..." he murmured, "But that is impossible. I will be taking the train tonight. However, just for you—only to you, I have something to say."</p>
<p>As the girl listened to the last sentence, the rain fell even harder. She then invited him into the house and closed the door behind him. They remained in a large, dim room.</p>
<p>"I don't think you know," he began hesitantly, "I think you may have already heard some news. I originally intended to tell your father in detail, but I have to go back quickly, and I must also keep my promise. You should know that I have returned from the front line. My name is Shan Wangfu Ti'an, and I am a friend of someone about whom you are deeply aware. Yes—Tuo Li'an. He was injured—heavily, very heavily—"</p>
<p>"My God!" she cried out, "He hasn't—please tell me the truth!"</p>
<p>He was silent; he assumed she must have understood. When he realized that he should have told her more carefully and slowly, he deeply regretted telling her the unfortunate news too hastily. He expected to see her face turn pale and tears hang on her cheeks. Unexpectedly, there was no trace of the terrible disappointment that he dreaded to see. He repeated softly:</p>
<p>"I promised him these—all of his things, like souvenirs, etc.—to bring here, in case something happened to him. These are them."</p>
<p>He placed a small package tied with a black band on a table between them.</p>
<p>"My God—my God! Poor Luyisi—what a misfortune!" the girl murmured.</p>
<p>"Luyisi? Aren't you Luyisi? Aren't you Bao Lu's fiancée?"</p>
<p>"No, no." She shook her shoulders confusedly and painfully, "Luyisi is my sister. She is already twenty-two years old. They were engaged before this war. I was only fourteen years old then. Poor Luyisi—she truly loved him, so passionately. A few days ago, she felt very unwell. She hasn't received a letter from him in a long time. She and Father went to town to try to find out some news."</p>
<p>"Then you are Aimi Li," the soldier said, "He often talked to me about you—but at that time you were just a child!"</p>
<p>"Yes, I am Aimi Li," she replied.</p>
<p>After a moment of silence, he looked at the small package and began again:</p>
<p>"This is for your sister. He told me that I must bring these here if, in the unlikely event, misfortune befell him. He fell beside me and died on the spot. I quickly did my best to keep my promise. He—Tuo Li'an—is my friend; we spent several months together. When he urged me to swear an oath to come here, he also stated that he would have the same obligation drawn for me, if something happened to me. However, for me, there is nothing to gain."</p>
<p>"Why?" Aimi Li asked, her eyes flickering.</p>
<p>"Why?" Forcing a smile, he replied, "Because I am a lonely person in this world—absolutely lonely. I have no parents, no relatives, no lover—no one cares about me. In short, almost no one gives me love. You know, even on the battlefield, at that time, I couldn't bear to say these things. I said many things that wouldn't interest you."</p>
<p>She looked at him tenderly; she was touched. After a moment of hesitation, the soldier finally asked a question very bravely:</p>
<p>"Do you have a lover on the battlefield?"</p>
<p>She shook her head, her face flushed. They stood there quietly, both bathed in a delicate, ambiguous emotion. They were overwhelmed by the sorrowful grief caused by the pitiful mementos on the table between them. The soldier confusedly thought about how he had been lucky enough to escape from death, and at the same time, he eagerly longed for survival and love. He wanted the object of his feelings to be this lively, black-haired girl. But he didn't have the courage to put his thoughts into words; he merely said:</p>
<p>"I will be leaving. But before I leave, I will ask for your consent one last time. Could you promise me to take care of a companion, so that when anything happens to me, they can bring what I want to leave to you? Would that make you uncomfortable?"</p>
<p>She stared at him. Her gray eyes were full of pity and sympathy, and she trembled slightly as she said:</p>
<p>"You will come back—I believe you will come back."</p>
<p>He repeated silently, understanding her true meaning, and he said harmoniously.</p>
<p>"I will return—here?"</p>
<p>She nodded, indicating her agreement. He took her hand, bent down, reached over the small package between them, and awkwardly kissed her forehead. Finally, in the dim light, he followed the path and walked through the forest. Finally, he gradually disappeared into the lush greenery, into the rain-soaked earth.</p>
<h3 id="e138">Listening to the Rain with a Snuffed Candle <a href="#e138" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c138" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">138</a></h3>
<p>— Yu Qin</p>
<p>"You listen to the rain yourself, making such rustling sighs. When other people listen to the rain, do you know if their hearts also make such desolate sighs? In different environments, the same rain falls, but among different people, there will not be the same mood. Can you vaguely tell me some of their moods?"</p>
<p>"I feel: some people listen to the rain in an ancient temple on a high mountain, that rain is like an elderly elder speaking with earnest and painstaking advice; some people listen to the rain in a boat cabin on the riverbank, that rain is like a weary traveler sighing with complaint; some people listen to the rain when they wake up from a Red Chamber dream, that rain is like lovers' soft and continuous whispers in a dream; some people listen to the rain in a leaky hut, that rain is like the grating groans of a patient tossing and turning in bed; some people listen to the rain by the desk in a study, that rain is like poets murmuring and answering each other..."</p>
<p>"When you say listening to the rain in an ancient temple on a high mountain, isn't that the scene of 'fine rain returning geese, lonely mountain boundless spring cold' and 'several thoughts of quiet talk together, night rain sitting on a meditation bed'? Listening to the rain in a boat cabin on the riverbank, isn't that the scene of 'a traveler's dream cannot help but be the rain on the back of the boat' and 'a small window, wind and rain break the heart, even more so on a lone boat pillow'? Listening to the rain when waking up from a Red Chamber dream, isn't that the scene of 'listening to the night rain, cold drops on the banana leaves, startling a good dream in the red window'? Listening to the rain in a leaky hut, isn't that the scene of 'how can one get through the long night of soaking wet'? Listening to the rain by the desk in a study, isn't that the scene of 'hating to listen to the rain with a snuffed candle, who accompanies lonely singing'?"</p>
<p>"You must like listening to the rain among the flowers. Isn't it even more beautiful to have flowers and rain? When peach blossoms first bloom, the tender red petals are displaying unparalleled beauty. After a shower, how can you not recall the beauty of a woman's face and peach blossoms and remember the words 'a face like peach blossoms newly wet with rain'? If there is a little sunlight, and the weather is such that the rain is gradually ceasing, and you think of the beauty of the woman, you will remember the beautiful line 'the sun's energy contains lingering rain, the peach blossoms are heavy with rain'; if you see the flowers falling, the petals withering, and you can't help but wonder if the woman has become thin and haggard, you will also think of how the red beauty of 'a cluster of peach blossoms, spring has no owner, left to the wind to blow and rain to beat' is so short-lived! When the plum blossoms first bloom, the yellow plums are moistened by the misty rain, how can you not chant a few lines: 'the plum is yellow, the rain is in season', 'the plum is yellow, the rain is misty', or 'where are the half-yellow plums, towards evening, a curtain of wind and rain', to praise them? 'Just like pear blossoms, spring brings rain', 'rain washes pear blossoms, jade has fragrance', this is the pear blossom covered with rain. The former sentence describes a person, and you can savor this person's appearance from this sentence. The latter sentence is like smelling the fragrance of pear blossoms after being washed by the rain. So the pear blossom covered with rain is also very beautiful, but this is only the beauty of 'plain'; not the 'bright' beauty like peach blossoms; 'apricot blossoms, light silk wet with drizzling rain', 'sometimes feeling desolate after the rain', this is the apricot blossom covered with rain. The words 'drizzling' and 'light' in the former sentence have already described the rain and silk very delicately, and adding the word 'wet' is like seeing the apricot blossoms being wet with rain; the latter sentence says that after the scattered rain, the apricot blossoms are scattered by the rain, and there is bound to be a feeling of desolation, but this is only the desolation of self-pity for one's unfortunate fate. 'Peonies cry in the lingering sun after the rain', 'chrysanthemums brave the rain for the Double Ninth Festival', 'a patch of rouge seems to be wet with rain', you can see the peony's tragic, the chrysanthemum's brave, and the begonia's graceful beauty."</p>
<p>"I don't like listening to the rain, especially not listening to the rain among the flowers. Flowers covered with rain are certainly beautiful, but precisely because they are beautiful, I don't want to listen to the rain among the flowers. As for 'wutong rain' or 'banana rain', those are even more unbearable rains. 'Sparse rain drips on the wutong tree' is still barely bearable to listen to, but 'wutong tree, midnight rain, I don't say the pain of parting is bitter, one leaf, one sound, dripping into the empty courtyard until dawn' is unbearable to listen to. 'Wutong night rain, how many times sleepless' even more shows the harm of this kind of rain, not even being able to sleep, how can one still listen to it? But from this, one also knows how powerful this heart-wrenching thing is!"</p>
<p>"The most difficult rain to listen to is the night rain. Zhang Yutian has long shouted out: 'The first is the difficult night rain.' So listening to the rain is not fun, nor is it an elegant matter; it is really a painful thing. But when it rains outside, one can't help but listen. I have my own way of listening. Pointless tears listen to the rising love spring in my chest, and the rising love spring in my chest listens to the misty raindrops. I can't tell what is a tear? What is rain? I only feel that the mixed love and pain flow gently from the molten spring in my heart..."</p>
<p>I can't say that I don't have a deep love for rain, but the rain that I deeply love is really a zither that plays a desolate melody in solitude. In the heart of the zither, a desolate rhyme from the zither is constantly transmitted from the desolate melody.</p>

<p>— Sun Yang</p>
<p>Curled up in this city for too long,</p>
<p>I crave the sea,</p>
<p>I came from the seaside,</p>
<p>I saw the sea's leap,</p>
<p>One wave swallowing another;</p>
<p>It is like an angry giant beast,</p>
<p>Madly wanting to devour everything, tear everything to pieces,</p>
<p>Singing the song of battle with a rain-like melody: …</p>
<p>Yet when the sea is at rest,</p>
<p>It is quieter than any creature;</p>
<p>Under the blue sky's benevolent gaze,</p>
<p>Under the sun's gentle caress,</p>
<p>It is like a newborn infant,</p>
<p>Making even snores,</p>
<p>Cheeks like April's roses,</p>
<p>Or like a ripe apple,</p>
<p>In Nature's cradle,</p>
<p>It dreams golden-green dreams,</p>
<p>In its dreams, white teeth occasionally flash as it laughs: …</p>
<p>It has been a long time since I saw the sea,</p>
<p>But the sea water is already a part of my blood,</p>
<p>When it surges in my veins,</p>
<p>I crave the sea,</p>
<p>I crave the wild sea of ten thousand horses galloping,</p>
<p>I crave the quiet sea like a blue ribbon,</p>
<p>Sea,</p>
<p>Breathing with a broad chest,</p>
<p>Sea,</p>
<p>Singing with a strong life force,</p>
<p>Sea,</p>
<p>Laden with huge ships and feather-like small sailboats,</p>
<p>Filled with food, machinery, civilization, love,</p>
<p>From one pole of the earth to the other …</p>
<p>On the other side of the sea,</p>
<p>In the distant places unreachable by human sight,</p>
<p>There are islands, there are continents, and the people who live on them,</p>
<p>You might think like this:</p>
<p>There are trees that are green all year round, there are red corals,</p>
<p>There is no deception, murder, oppression, fear,</p>
<p>People live freely, loving each other with a true heart …</p>
<p>Sea,</p>
<p>I want to rush towards you,</p>
<p>Leap into your embrace,</p>
<p>Washing away the dirt accumulated in my heart and on my body,</p>
<p>In your impact,</p>
<p>I will begin to laugh loudly,</p>
<p>With agile skill,</p>
<p>Striving to swim to the other shore.</p>

<h3 id="e140">Reader Consultation Legal Interpretation An Old Incident from Seven Years Ago A Dispute Over Mortgaged Housing <a href="#e140" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c140" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">140</a></h3>
<p>Mr. Huang Jianming asks: I have several questions regarding a housing dispute and hope to receive answers in the consultation column. My ancestral home is in Chongde County, Zhejiang. I came to Shanghai to study at a young age. In the 31st year of the Republic [1942], my mother mortgaged a house to a Mr. Lu from the same village. A contract was drawn up, with a term of five years. At the time, I was away and unaware of this. Two years ago, Mr. Lu passed away, and the house is now occupied by his nephew and son. Recently, I returned home on business and was shocked to learn that his nephew suddenly declared that, as the term had expired, the mortgage should be considered a final sale and the house could not be redeemed. I would like to ask: (1) As I was unaware when my mother mortgaged the house to Mr. Lu, is this mortgage legally valid? (2) The mortgage contract was drafted by Mr. Lu's relative, and neither my mother nor the intermediaries were literate and did not understand its contents. Is this type of mortgage contract valid? (3) Does Mr. Lu's nephew have the right to interfere in this matter? (4) As the mortgage term expired two years ago, can the house still be redeemed?</p>
<p>[Lawyer Tang Wushi's Answer] (1) According to inheritance laws, spouses inherit from each other. Therefore, if your father passed away after the implementation of the Civil Code, your mother and you jointly inherited the property. If the house is considered your exclusive property, then according to Article 1088, Paragraph 2 of the Civil Code, your mother also has the right to use and benefit from it. Based on this, the contract cannot be deemed invalid. (2) If the contract is solely a mortgage (known as "Dian Quan" in the Civil Code) and your mother received the mortgage money, it constitutes a mutual agreement and should be considered valid. If the content exceeds the scope of a mortgage, then it should be discussed separately. (3) Mr. Lu's nephew has no right to interfere. Mr. Lu's son is a minor and should be represented by his guardian. (4) You can request redemption.</p>

<h3 id="e143">Recent World Literary Scene <a href="#e143" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c143" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">143</a></h3>
<p>— Zhao Jingshen</p>
<p>Pushkin Museum</p>
<p>The Literary Museum in Leningrad, now belonging to the Soviet Academy of Sciences, developed from the Pushkin Museum, starting in 1905.</p>
<p>The Pushkin Museum is a vast repository of Pushkin's manuscripts, mostly collected from the famous Onegin (A. F. Onegin) and the poet's own library. The latter materials were provided by Pushkin's son, A. Pushkin, in 1906.</p>
<p>Besides Pushkin's own manuscripts and works, the Pushkin Museum began collecting manuscripts and literary materials from other Russian poets, writers, and celebrities.</p>
<p>After the October Revolution, the Pushkin Museum transformed from a literary archive into the Literary Museum of the Academy of Sciences, becoming a center for Soviet literary research.</p>
<p>Now this academic institution has several departments for literary research: Old Russian Literature, New Russian Literature, Western Literature, Folklore and Folk Documents, Images, Audio Recordings, Models, and so on. The Pushkin, Gorky, Blok, and other committees of the Academy of Sciences all fall under the jurisdiction of this Literary Museum.</p>
<p>The manuscript department holds up to 500,000 pages, making it the most important manuscript collection in the Soviet Union. There is also a literary museum department, with about 50,000 items. These exhibition halls feature permanent displays of the lives and works of great Russian writers. For example, Pushkin's last residence, the so-called Pushkin Museum (12 Moika Street), the Nikolai Nekrasov Memorial Museum, and the Pushkin Memorial Park in Mikhailovskoye village are all under the Literary Museum's jurisdiction. The Literary Museum holds about 300,000 literary books.</p>
<p>The main task of the Literary Museum now is to publish a "History of Russian Literature" in ten volumes, from ancient times to the literary revolution. Gorky was the museum director in 1935. The famous scholars on the editorial board include P. Lebedev-Polyansky, A. Orlov, and M. Sholokhov, all members of the Academy of Sciences. Volumes 1, 2, 3, and 5 of this rich literary history have been published, and Volumes 6 and 8 are in print.</p>
<p>Another major task for scholars is the four-volume "History of Russian Literary Criticism," which began during the war (1943). This book narrates from the 18th century to the October Revolution. The first volume, "The Birth of 18th-Century Russian Literary Criticism," has been written and is expected to be completed by the end of this year.</p>
<p>Work on the History of Western European Literature has also begun. Last year, the first volume of the "History of French Literature" was published, from ancient times to the revolution of 1789. The second volume, from the revolution of 1789 to the present, is also about to go to print.</p>
<p>"Russian Folklore" in three volumes, is edited by the museum's folklore department. In addition, the museum has published many academic papers discussing important literary history issues. Among the most famous are B. Mellakh's "Ilyich and Problems of Russian Literature in the Transition Period of the 19th Century," P. Lebedev-Polyansky's "Belinsky, the Literary Critic," A. Orlov's "Cossack Heroic Epics, Heroic Themes of Ancient Russian Literature," and V. Adrianova-Peretz's "Studies on the Style of Ancient Russian Poetry."</p>
<p>Of particular note is the translation of "Shakespeare's Complete Works." A. Smirnov, Doctor of Linguistics, wrote a thesis arguing that Shakespeare was the representative of the most sublime humanistic thought of his time. He also analyzed Shakespeare's style and technique. The final chapter covers various historical interpretations of Shakespeare.</p>
<p>C. Derzhavin, Doctor of Linguistics, is also very interested in his research on Voltaire.</p>
<p>This institution publishes regular periodicals and magazines on literary research, such as "Journal of the Pushkin Committee," "Western Literature Report," "Literary Heritage," and "Report of the Manuscript Department of the Literary Museum." The second volume of "Western Literature Report" was published last year, featuring A. Smirnov's "The Art of Shakespeare," and T. Alexeyey's "Defoe and the Problem of Historical Novels," among others.</p>
<p>Another important task of this organization is to publish academic versions of the complete works of Russian literature, such as those of Pushkin, Gogol, Lermontov, and Belinsky.</p>

<h3 id="e144">Re-visiting Mei Lanfang (Part 2) <a href="#e144" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c144" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">144</a></h3>
<p>— Cao Zikai</p>
<p>Thinking about his evening performance of "Selling the Horse," I felt that I should let him rest and not bother him any further, so I got up to say goodbye. But taking a photo was a must. I asked him to go to the open space outside as before. This open space was the same as last year, except for the addition of a small goat. This little goat was affectionate and very cute. Because I didn't invite a photographer, Chen Baoyi and I took turns taking the pictures. Because I didn't bring a tripod, I couldn't use the self-timer, so the two of us took turns operating the camera, each taking a photo with the Peking Opera King. These two fan girls regretted that they couldn't take a photo with the Peking Opera King at the same time. On the way out after saying goodbye, they kept muttering many "I shouldn't haves." [Editor's note: In order to make up for this "I shouldn't have," I hesitated for a long time. The two photos that Mr. Feng sent me were identical in composition, and it was impossible to publish them both. Publishing just one would be unsatisfactory, so I discussed it with Mr. Lu, the person in charge of typesetting at the newspaper (Mr. Feng's student). The result is the photo now published. For poetic justice, I don't think there's any problem with this, right?]</p>
<p>But I fell into deep thought. This is what I thought:</p>
<p>Last spring, I visited Mei Lanfang with a religious state of mind, feeling that in the impermanent life, his career was a play within a play, a dream within a dream; a fleeting moment, a pity! This spring, I visited Mei Lanfang with an artistic state of mind, and I felt that his art had the highest social value and was most worthy of promotion. There are many kinds of art, no less than a dozen: painting, medicine, epigraphy, sculpture, architecture, crafts, music, dance, literature, drama, film, photography. Among these dozen arts, the most deeply rooted in the people is Peking Opera in drama—farmers and old men, village children, who don't know a word or understand painting, and have never seen a movie, but they can all hum a few Peking Opera tunes, and they all understand Cao Cao's treachery, Guan Gong's loyalty, Third Lady's chastity, and Dou E's injustice…and appreciate with fascination, and comment with enthusiasm. This proves that Peking Opera (or local dramas similar to Peking Opera) has a long history in our country, is deeply rooted, and penetrates everywhere, so its social effect is the highest. Calligraphy and painting are also ancient arts with thousands of years of history, why are they far less popular than Peking Opera? This further proves that Peking Opera not only has a long history, but also has a kind of magic in its essence that attracts human feelings and goes deep into people's hearts, so it can be so popular, so popular with the masses. It's just a pity that some of the Peking Opera that has been passed down in the past contain toxins in terms of content and meaning, such as feudal ideology, male chauvinism, and superstitious ghosts and gods. If this kind of toxin can be removed and replaced with vitamins that enhance people's health, then the social effect of Peking Opera is limitless, and it is easy to use it to govern the country and pacify the world. At that time, our Peking Opera King will become a wise king of the world!</p>
<p>I forgot to mention earlier: when I visited Mr. Mei, I also gave him a fan painted and calligraphed by myself. What I painted was the monk Manshu's poem "Maids Gathering Firewood Amidst Mountains of Red Leaves." What I wrote was the song "Golden Thread Song" that Hongyi, when he was still a layman, gave to the singing boy Jinwawa. The words said: Autumn has arrived in Jiangnan. Too hastily, spring's remaining dream shadows, before the cup, under the brows. Indulge in the music of middle age, racing through rouge-painted troops in fur. How did it all come to be remnants? A pure jade from Kunlun, a clear god, purple cherries freely tying red affections. Ten thousand measures of sorrow, come, put it away. Meddle with the painted faces on the stage. Experience the heroism, the autumn lady's feelings. The sounds of the young phoenix are clear, dissolving the anger that fills the chest. I laugh at myself as just a commoner. Running around the world without achieving anything, I ask, how is it that I entrust my feelings to sights and sounds? Ten thousand measures of sorrow, come, put it away. Both painting and medicine were written with a very full spirit on a clear morning. Because this person has such a vast and universal artistic genius, and has shown such a noble personality in the anti-Japanese war period—I sincerely love him, and I have to "bow down at his pomegranate skirt." (Others ridicule my words.) I should actually bow down. Feng Zikai, "famous throughout the world," "known to women and children" (others praise my words), the teahouse and the bookkeeper of the Zhenhua Hotel did not recognize. It was not until the next day that Mr. Mei came to the hotel to visit me in return, and the teahouse and bookkeepers were surprised, and then they went to buy commemorative albums to ask me to write inscriptions. (Written in Hangzhou on May 22nd of the 37th year of the Republic [1948], the day Mei Lanfang stopped performing.)</p>
<h3 id="e145">Pay Attention to Yang Mei <a href="#e145" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c145" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">145</a></h3>
<p>— Miao Wenrui</p>
<p>The news of Yang Mei in Sichuan not eating for nine years, as reported by this newspaper for several days, has aroused the curiosity of many readers. Most scientists believe it is absurd and unworthy of attention, and more readers regard it as gossip for after-dinner conversation. But since the report in this newspaper on May 15th and 16th that Yang Mei's not eating is a fact, we can no longer regard it lightly, and some visionary scientists have become nervous. If all human beings in the world were like Yang Mei and did not eat all year round, then land reform or land revolution would lose their arguments, agriculture and agricultural administration would lose their importance, and most farmers would change their occupations, and politics and life would undergo great changes!</p>
<p>Director Li Zhiyu has used scientific methods to confirm that Yang Mei's not eating is a true fact. According to the report in this newspaper, the next step will be to invite the Dean of the West China University Medical School to study her metabolism. All living things have metabolism, and without this function there is no life. Since Yang Mei can live, there must be metabolism, no doubt, but its nature is similar to that of plants, as long as it absorbs air and spring water, it can directly manufacture substances in the body and generate heat to maintain life. Yang Mei's physiological state may have the following two scenarios: In the first scenario, the hemoglobin in Yang Mei's body may have deteriorated and is similar to the chlorophyll of plants, and with carbon dioxide and water, it can produce carbohydrates without having to ingest other foods. In the second scenario, Yang Mei's blood may contain special bacteria that secrete an enzyme that makes the function of hemoglobin similar to that of chlorophyll, directly manufacturing carbohydrates in the body. If Yang Mei belongs to the first scenario, then there is a "vegetable person" in the world, one more miracle, if we can find the reason, then everyone can make their own hemoglobin deteriorate and not eat all year round; if it belongs to the second scenario, we can take a small amount of Yang Mei's blood, use artificial culture to cultivate the bacteria, and then transplant the bacteria into the human body, then all humans in the world can not eat. Based on these views, the author hopes that Director Li Zhiyu will pay attention to Yang Mei's blood properties and physiology. Since Yang Mei can not eat, there must be a reason, if we can fully know the secret, then everyone can not eat and become the so-called "earthly immortal." Yang Mei is a research material that is hard to come by in a thousand years, I hope that scientists across the country will pay attention to this material and study it carefully!</p>

<p>— Chen Meng'an</p>
<p>How many more winds and rains can be endured? How much sorrow is added? Years are spent growing old by sorrow, and it has nothing to do with the end of spring; the flowers understand language, and they are already filled with hatred, scattered and becoming fragrant soil; swallows dance, counting the embellishments of good times, dreams are confused and drunk, the taste is not as before. Jiangnan is good, do not grieve over the past, fragrant grass on the southern shore, China only has tears at the New Pavilion, a broken heart like Pan Lang's poems, you and I should cherish it, moving the palace and changing the tune on the perilous strings, a thousand threads, looking at the slanting intestines outside the willows, the vast river water silently flows eastward.</p>
<h3 id="e147">Water Dragon Chant <a href="#e147" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c147" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">147</a></h3>
<p>In early spring, I once obtained a sentence: "Do not say that injuries cannot be expected, the grass grows in Jiangnan again at this time, the scenery before me surrounds my heart, I am too lazy to learn to write poetry." The meaning touched me, and I created it casually, not knowing what it was referring to. Sitting silently on a clear night, I found it in scattered books, and developed it into this tune, still with the same meaning.</p>
<p>Heartbreaking smoke and willows slanting in the sun, spring has passed two-thirds, red is sparse and green is dark, swallows are busy and orioles are tender, what does it have to do with people! Spring is pitiful enough, spring still has a way, thousands of miles of Jiangnan, I ask the long pavilions and short mounds, coming south and going north, how much sorrow do you taste? Counting with my fingers, how many happy moments can there be? Just sing wildly, smashing the jade pot; the emotions in my heart, the scenery before me, are still the same today, do not ascend the tower lightly, you must drink wine, exhaust your heroic spirit, let the unsatisfactory things, eight or nine times out of ten, entrust to deep drunkenness.</p>
<h3 id="e148">America's Guest House <a href="#e148" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c148" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">148</a></h3>
<p>— Lei Hong</p>
<p>America's guest house for foreign dignitaries is across from the White House, known as Blair House. The government purchased this building in 1940. The hostess of the mansion is Mrs. Kinnane. Whether she's called the hostess, housewife, or manager, her work is more than just making tea and coffee. She manages servants, books, and shopping.</p>
<p>She has hosted presidents from every country in Central and South America. Others, such as King Peter of Yugoslavia, Prince Faisal of Saudi Arabia, the Prime Minister of Canada, and countless foreign ambassadors and ministers—Molotov has visited twice—have all stayed at this mansion. President Roosevelt, for the sake of rest, lived at Blair House. Truman also lived there for three weeks before entering the White House.</p>
<p>According to Mrs. Kinnane, national leaders are the easiest people in the world to host because they are all humble and polite. "I always let guests stay quietly in their rooms and don't disturb them," she said. "They come to America with important missions, and they are not at peace. This is the only place where they can rest and relax, so I always avoid meeting them. I never eat with them, but if they ask me to have tea with them, I will."</p>
<p>People think that Mrs. Kinnane's job is very easy, but in fact, she has no summer or winter vacation and works 12 to 18 hours a day. If there are no foreign envoys to host, the Secretary of State uses Blair House to host foreign ambassadors for meals, tea, or dinners. Once a distinguished guest is lodging, everything from breakfast to sleep must be taken care of, to check whether everything goes smoothly. And serving guests sleep usually takes until 3:00 a.m. to rest.</p>
<p>Guests often write to Mrs. Kinnane after leaving America and returning home, full of pleasant memories. At every festival, kings and magnates send Mrs. Kinnane congratulatory letters and telegrams.</p>
<p>Mrs. Kinnane was born in Washington. Twenty-eight years ago, she met Mrs. Blair at a picnic. Later, Mrs. Blair asked her to host this aristocratic mansion on Pennsylvania Avenue, and so she became the housekeeper of the mansion and has continued to this day for 20 years.</p>
<p>Later, the American government bought the mansion, which was like buying Mrs. Kinnane as well. Her first hosting of government officials won unanimous praise, so the State Department asked her to serve Blair House as a lifelong career.</p>
<p>The visit of the Saudi Arabian princes to Blair House can be regarded as the most exotic. During the week that the princes lived there, it was as if they had transformed the mansion into another world. They were all six feet tall and wore beautiful robes. They walked without a sound. In fact, you really couldn't hear a sound from them in the house. They were extremely devout in their religion, and the incense in the room swirled, reaching outside the room.</p>

<p>— Dongfang Mengwu</p>
<p>The road to the court is wide, but the road back is narrow.</p>
<p>A bad peace is better than a good fight.</p>
<p>Poverty is not a sin, but it is worse than a sin.</p>
<p>In the storm, it is okay to pray to God, but you still have to try your best to move forward.</p>

<h3 id="e150">Masaryk's Humor <a href="#e150" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c150" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">150</a></h3>
<p>— Yuchuang</p>
<p>The former Czechoslovak Foreign Minister Jan Masaryk, who recently committed suicide, was a very humorous figure during his lifetime.</p>
<p>Once, a diplomat talked to him about the United States. The diplomat said: The food in America is not bad, but at banquets, the female guests on your left, right, and across from you seem to have endless questions every day, making you busy answering and simply not having time to eat.</p>
<p>Masaryk was naturally an old hand at attending such banquets. He said that he had a wonderful method for eating safely at banquets.</p>
<p>His method was: "I first ask the female guest sitting on my right: 'Are you married?' If her answer is 'yes', I ask her again if she has any children. If she answers, 'yes, two,' I say, 'Why bother?' She will no longer bother me... Then I ask the female guest sitting on my left, and it turns out that she is also married. I ask her again if she has any children, and she says, 'No.' I ask, 'How is that possible?' She will no longer pay attention to me... Then I ask the female guest sitting across from me: 'Are you married?' She says, 'No.' I ask again: 'Then do you have any children?'—After this set of questions and answers, I can eat with peace of mind, without fear of being disturbed by others."</p>
<h3 id="e151">Vegetarianism <a href="#e151" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c151" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">151</a></h3>
<p>— Ruyi</p>
<p>According to recent scientific research, the only animals that live longer than humans are a species that grows on the Seychelles Islands. This species is vegetarian.</p>
<p>The longest-lived mammal besides humans is the elephant, and the elephant is vegetarian.</p>
<p>The longest-lived member of the bird family is the parrot, and the parrot is vegetarian.</p>
<p>Apes, the "close relatives" of humans in the animal world, are also vegetarian.</p>
<h3 id="e152">A Miracle <a href="#e152" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c152" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">152</a></h3>
<p>— Jin Jin</p>
<p>One day, due to my work, I was passing a corner of Gongping Road in Hongkou when I caught sight of a stack of brand-new Western magazines tied together with rope at a secondhand stall. I bent down to take a look and saw that some were French drama magazines and others were British publications. The majority were American magazines on subjects such as chemistry, mathematics, economics, sociology, journalism, and art. After casually selecting five or six, the stall owner priced them by weight. In the end, I spent 190,000 Legal Tender to buy the latest April to May 1948 publications, worth two dollars and fifteen cents in gold bullion. This even included a May issue of Reader's Digest from this year. Amidst this rampant inflation, it must be said, this is nothing short of a miracle.</p>
<p>While I was astonished by this miracle, I couldn't help but feel a few emotions. Firstly, when all is said and done, the fate of books is always unfortunate. If these were not books, but nylon stockings, lipstick, pens, or ties, they would probably have been sold at a good price long ago. I think there are more people willing to spend money on a tie worth one US dollar than on a book of the same value. Not to mention learning for practical use, it seems that fewer and fewer people regard knowledge as an adornment in this era. Now, we seem to only hear the boasting of numbers, such as Mr. A spending 70 million on a custom-made suit, etc. On the other hand, even those who pretend to be refined seem out of touch with the times.</p>
<p>Secondly, I am someone who believes that "opportunity knocks but once." It is hard to say when I will be able to buy similar inexpensive books again. A friend of mine who studies music once discovered a complete set of recordings by a major composer in a consignment store. At the time, they couldn't close the deal due to a difference of several tens of thousands of dollars. By the time he brought the money back to buy them, someone else had already beaten him to it. In reality, buying records is like this, buying books is like this, and so too is life's fortune. It's just that merely having opportunity, without knowing how to use it, is still useless. Here, I am often reminded of a saying in a biography from a certain issue of Fortune: "Opportunity is at the disposal of those who are prepared."</p>
