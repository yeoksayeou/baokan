<h3>報到代表足法定人數國民大會今晨開幕會期定廿二日明舉行首次預備會　總統四月十二日可選出</h3>

<p>〔合衆社南京廿八日電〕蔣主席發表措詞嚴正之聲明後，民主社會黨發言。人廿八日稱：該黨對蔣主席之決定，認爲「非常合理而優良」，表示該黨對此全部滿意。</p>
<h3>民靑國代問題解決青年黨聲明決參加大會</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿八日電〕行憲國大召開前夕，參政十載之國民參政會，廿八日依法正式宣吿結束。　顧十年輝煌史實，各參政員一面慶祝鉅責完成，同時依依於十載相聚，特鄭重舉行結束茶會，敦請蔣主席蒞臨致訓。而歷届參政員，尤以參政會雖吿結束，本身對國家責任並未隨而消逝，特組歷屆參政員聯誼會，以十年經驗，繼續爲完成民主政治而奮鬥。聯誼會於廿八日晨正式成立，並發表宣言，選出莫德惠等五十一人爲理事，胡適等三十一人爲監事。</p>
<p>結東茶會廿八日下午舉行，出席歷届參政員百餘人，政府自長參加者有孫科，于右任，張羣，王雲五，鮑爾漢，王世杰，兪鴻鈞，朱家　，許世英，薛篤弼，杭立武，徐柏園，謝冠生，李惟果等。參政會主席團張伯苓，莫德惠，吳貽芳，江庸等亦均出席。蔣主席於下午三時五十五分蒞會塲，着戎裝，神采奕奕。</p>

<h3>白部長返京</h3>
<p>對大別山戰局樂觀</p>
<p>〔本報南京廿八日電〕國防部長白崇禧，日前飛漢巡視，已於廿八日下午公畢飛返百都。記者特往訪，詢其關於大別山區之戰况。承稱：大別山匪區目前已進入淸剿散匪階段，共匪主力已全部被擊破，共匪對各縣鄕鎭間實已失却面的控制，國軍則在軍事之掩護下發展對政治機構之親織。故目前各縣鄕鎭之保甲均已建立，共匪糧食已無來源，壯丁亦抽不着，情報工作更感困難，計九江前進指揮部自去歲十月廿七日成立迄今，爲期計四個月，其原擬各項工作均已大致獲得完成，目前如軍政能充分合作，大別山區之剿匪工作可無問題。白氏談話充分自信，頗顯示戰局之樂觀。</p>
<h3>蔣主席訓詞全文政府必負責肅清匪禍信心堅定可克服困難</h3>
<p>蔣主席在國民參政會結束茶會上致詞全文如次：</p>
<p>參政會成立迄今，已歷十年，此十年中各位同仁，團結一致，協助政府，以完成抗戰使命，實爲本會對於國家民族不朽之貢獻，而尤爲本人所時刻　念不忘者。今當本會結束之際，個人回想十年以前政府有一決策，至今引爲遺憾者，即對於共產黨仇計的錯誤。政府當時以爲共產黨在民族大義之前，必能放棄其推翻政府，破壞統一之陰謀，而與全國同胞共同戮力於抗戰建國之大業，故容納其參加本會；不料此一錯誤之決定，乃釀成今日之惡果，現在共匪公開叛變，使國家領土不能收復，人民痛苦日益加深，此政府所應負責者，然政府必負責到底，徹底肅清匪禍，拯救人民，收復失地，確保我國家之統一與獨立。</p>
<p>現在一般人以爲國家目前的形勢，較之抗戰初期更爲嚴重，此實爲一種表面的看法；吾人觀察國家民族之安危，必見其大者遠</p>
<h3>主席告全國青年書勉認識國家危機自己責任剷除革命障礙奠國家基礎</h3>
<p>〔中央社南京廿八日電〕廿儿日爲黃花崗紀念日，亦爲第五届靑年節，蔣主席特設表吿全國青年　，全文如下：</p>
<p>今天是貢花　七十二烈士殉國的紀念日，也是我們第五届的青年節，又正是我　民主憲政開始的時期，這一個　　的節目，更有其偉大的意議，我全國青年必須追念先烈的前緒，繼承先烈的志業，以求無媿爲我中華民族繼往開來的優秀靑年。</p>
<p>我們五十年來國民革命的目的，在拯救國家的危亡，建立我中華民國爲獨立自由統一民主的新國家，而黃花崗一役，發揚了革命青年獻身於國至大至剛的犧牲精神、喚醒了當時一般社會奄奄　盡的民族意識，　來　亥革命的成功，北伐統一的完成以及抗戰時期知　靑年從軍運動的成就，都是　承這一個光榮傳統而來。現在我們抗戰勝利已逾兩年，在勝利之始，由於共黨阻撓受降，阻　復員，堅持武力割據，破壞國家統一，使我們中國失去了戰後建國千載一時的良機，政府爲求取和平建設，不惜一再忍讓，而共匪則利用商談調處的機會，以擴大其侵佔　域與叛變武力，最後揭開其僞裝的假面具，實行全面叛亂，不惜毀滅國家，斷送民族，破壞社會經濟，危害國民生計。共匪竄擾所至，生產交通全被破壤，糧食物資悉被掠奪，匪區民衆遭受慘無人道的蹂躪屠戳，後方同胞同受貧困　寒的生活苦痛，我們國家民族到了今天，又臨到一個生死存亡的嚴重時期，爲了保持我革命先烈與抗戰軍民所犧牲而得的獨立自由的光榮，我們必須繼承他們的事業，殊死奮鬥，以完成救國的偉大任務。青年是國家　起的生命，我首先要喚醒我全國青年們認織國家危機，認識自己的責任，及時　發，來剷除我們革命建國的最大障礙，來奠定我們國家獨立自由的基礎，來保證我們民主憲政與三民主義的實現。</p>
<p>我全國靑年們，要知道我們過去八年抗戰是爲了保障國家的獨立生存，恢復領土主權的完整，以求得經濟建設與民主憲政的完成，但是這一切的前提都寄於國家的統一，世界上任何民族獨立運勸或民族復興運動，同時必就是國家統一運動，惟有國家得到統一，而後民族　能確保其獨立。就美國來說，美國　國運動肇始於一七七五年的獨立戰爭，但是美國國基的奠定，則在七十餘年後，南北戰爭林肯總統撃退了南方分離運動，方始得到長治久安的保陣，由此可知建國工作決非一蹴可成，而統一事業更必須經過戡平叛亂的長期奮鬥，方能從艱險苦痛中獲得成功。國家沒有統一，就不能保持獨立平等的地位，國家沒有統一，就不能保障人民的自由，以推行民主憲政，國家沒有統一，就不能進行經濟建設，以增進人民生活。我們國家今天所遭受的困難，人民所忍受的　　，都是共匪叛亂所造成。共匪一天　有剿滅，國家就一天不能統一，不但人民困苦無法解除，經濟危機無法挽救，而整個民族的獨立生存就沒有保障，最後勢必趨於整個的滅亡。觀於共匪這一年來叛亂的蔓延和陰謀的擴大，很明顯的他終極目的必欲淪我中國爲附庸，陷我同胞爲奴隸，然後舉我中國的領土人民和一切物力資源作爲危害世界和平的工具，明瞭這一個意義，就可知道我們國家爲什麼在八年苦戰元氣未復的時候，不得不忍痛犧牲，而從事於動員戡亂，要可以知道，動員戡亂是我們全中國愛國同胞與愛國青年無可旁貸的責任了。</p>
<p>我們革命建國的事業，不知遭遇了多少次的挫折，多少次的陣碳，多少次的難關，自袁世凱帝制，張勳復辟，軍閥割據以迄於日本帝國主義的侵略，無不一一爲我民族精神和三民主義的革命　力所摧毀，而今日的共匪叛亂，則是承襲了一切反革命的衣　缽，集流冠·漢奸·反動軍閥和帝國主義侵略勢力的大成，這種具有國　性的內亂，可以說是革命以來第一次遭受到最大的難關，也可以說今天總是國民革命和反革命勢力最後的決戰。唯有這一次決戰的勝利，纔可以　固國家統一，確保民族獨立，纔可以完成政治民主，進行經濟建設，纔可以發揮我中華民族愛好和平獨立自主的、精神，消弭世界和平人類安全的咸脅。我個人自從廿二歲參加同盟會，追隨國父革命，到今年正滿四十年，我覺得這一次眞是我們革命以來生死存亡最危險嚴重的戰鬥，但以我四十年來參加革命的經驗，我可以斷定這次戡亂的勝利，比之以往任何時期革命戰爭的收穫更爲偉大，更有意義。國父有言「凡事之順乎天理，應乎人心，合乎世界潮流者，無不成」。我全國同胞誠能秉持抗戰時期一貫的精神，認識正羲，必能戰勝暴力，人性必能克服獸性的眞理，萬衆一心，協同一致，同舟共濟，努力奮鬥，則今日最後的難關即是不久獎來最後成功的基礎。無論中外古今，凡是悖逆天理，違反潮流的匪寇，決沒有不被消滅的，革命建國和民主自由的陣礙，決沒有不被　除的。靑年們是國家命運所託命，祇要我全國靑年確立報國的志願，充實報國的休養，明是非，辨順逆，發揮奮鬥精神，承當時代使命，則國家前途始終是光明的，國民革命事業必然是成功的，我在今天要以下列各點，鄭重　勉我全國愛國有志的青年·（下接第二版左角）</p>
<h3>莫德惠的競選實力</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿八日航訊〕在競選副總統候選人的陣容裏，莫德惠先生，無疑的是　樹一幟。他不是握有實權的官吏，也不擁有廣大陣容的武帥。他，只不過是一個沒有機構　無黨派者。那麽，他靠什麼競選？其實話說回來，他就沒有決定要參加競選。當旅京東北人士已經給他組織了助選會的時候，記者去訪他，他就這麽顫着聲浪說：「我還有什麽心來競選什麽副總統？我的家都破碎了，我還談競選？」柳老眞是一副慈腸，當這個幾乎是人吃人的世界，他還仁慈心腸的直念國破家亡之痛。他這份心慈，尤其說明了，他並不是只爲了他是出身在吉林，而更爲了「　」可是，也就爲了這樣，東北人士個個料自動的擁護他，幾次三番的敦勸他參加競選，的確，他是在「盛情難却」的情况下，開始透露他已應允參加競選的消息的。</p>
<p>他是人盡皆知的社會賢達。在參政會，他永遠像一個專門做緩衝的溫和派。在國民黨共產黨由合而分由分而合，幾度折衝，那一次沒有柳老的奔波！但是，對貪官他要抨擊，對劣政他要檢舉；他並非眞正的溫和派。只不過他的溫和是對人，對事則必求曲直。</p>
<p>在東北人士的心裏，他是深深的種下了根，他們永遠惦念着柳老·這兩年來，東北宣勞，慰問，以及救濟，募款，幾乎每一次都是他領導，只要他登高一呼，沒有不可辦的。不過，說這些，還只在情感。事實上，他對東北人士所做的，等於把中央政府和東北地方政府連貫一氣了。沒有他的周旋，東北人士誰個不說：「中央根本忘記我們了！「誰又不說：「政府已決心放棄東北了」因此，有人認爲：一柳老幾乎抵上中央對東北全局的政治力量，現在大總統已經是　衆一心的擁護蔣主席了。蔣主席是南方人，如果副總統再來一個南方人，恐怕北方人的心要冷下去，中央的政治還是這麽偏桔！還是用這種偏桔的政策」！因此如果能讓莫先生出任副總統，多少給東北人一些安慰。</p>
<p>他在這競選陣營裏，是獨樹一織的，可是他決不利用任何一點機會來强姦民意，他要客客氣氣的讓人心悅誠服的投他一票。可是他顯然是沒有一個有組織的　　的，難說他就連一點實力都沒有？錯了，一位旁面的觀察家就這麼對我說：「他是超黨派的，因此參政會這個集幽有一部份人會支持他。他是北方人，因此華北二十九省市，和東北九省三市的人士無疑的會支持他。他不是國民黨，尤其他是與各黨相折衝的調解人，所以如果民社黨靑年黨自己不提候選人的時候，一定會支持他。還有另外一個不小的力量，就是天主敎。「這麽說來，莫德惠的競選實力是相當龐大的。</p>
<h3>錦義間國軍會師瀋陽民眾徒步遷徒入關</h3>
<p>〔本報潘陽廿八日電〕錦州義縣間國軍，於廿七日在錦北廿五公里之七里河子會師，空軍協同　淸殘匪·潘南太子河兩岸散匪肅淸，各渡口完全爲國軍控制，正安撫流亡中。空軍活躍，連日轟炸平梅綫各城鎭，匪軍補給交通受嚴重打擊。</p>
<p>〔本報潘陽廿八日電〕連日由　徒步赴錦轉往關內民衆，約五六百人，彼等隨身携帶小包裏，約七日可達，成爲絡譯不絕之遷徙行列。者，苟能於遠大處着眼，則今日國家之形藝，遠勝於抗戰初期。回憶本會第一次集會於武漢，其時首都尚在敵寇佔領之下，至於軍事政治外交情形，皆無確切之把握，所恃以奮鬥者，惟吾人一片爲國爲民之赤忱與對於國家民族之信心耳。今則，國家一切基礎已由各位同仁過去十年之奮門，健全確立，吾人苟有堅定之信心，則國家民族之前途，決無危險，一切困難　可克服。現在本會雖已結束，而諸君對於國家民族所負之責任，依然存在，故望諸君仍本十年前共赴國難之決心，繼續過去十年如一日之努力，協助政府，同舟共濟，以完成戡亂建國之使命。</p>

<h3>社論　走上民主憲政的第一布</h3>
<p>——紀念革命先烈並慶祝第五屆青年節</p>
<p>今天是革命先烈紀念日，同時也是第五　靑年節：而行憲的第一屆國民大會，也定於今天在首都開幕，更加重了今天紀念革命先烈及慶祝靑年節的意義。這次國民大會的基本任務，乃在行使憲法所賦予之職權，完成民選政府之組織，從而結束一黨負責的政制，使全國所有和平合法的政黨，均可循憲法所規定之軌道，共負政治責任。所以今天是爲我國足踏實地走上民主憲政的第一步；同時也是我國和平，統一，民主，强大的重大關鍵。我們緬懷過去革命先烈犧牲的壯烈，正視當前所面臨的種種危機，再瞻望民族國家的前途，不得不將我們所有的希望，完全寄托在今日的靑年身上，更加盼望這次召開的行憲國大能爲我國民主憲政奠定一個鞏固的始某。</p>
<p>回憶民國紀元以前的革命運動，先後不知經過多少次的義舉，前仆後繼，再接再厲，不知流了多少鮮血，也不知拋了多少頭顱！誰都知道，這些都是我們中華兒女革命靑年轟轟烈烈以自己的鮮血寫成的光榮史蹟：不論是集體的行動，或是單獨的「殺身成仁」「捨身取義」，無不令人痛哭流涕：尤其是三十七年前的今天，黃花崗七十二烈士向時作壯烈的犧牲，實足以動天地而泣鬼神。這一次的革命運動雖然失敗，但是七十二烈士的鮮血並未白流，他們偉大的犧牲精神，不特喚醒了沉睡着的國魂，而且給國人一個精神上的偉大感召，奠定了革命成功的基礎。所以我國的革命運動，自始至終，都是建某於革命靑年的身上的。</p>
<p>從黃花崗七十二烈士犧牲到今天，已經三十七年了。在此期間，我們靠了先烈的鮮血與頭顱，雖然推翻了腐敗專制的滿淸，雖然鏟除了內戰不已的軍閥，雖然打倒了侵略的日本帝國主義，取消了一切不平等條約，但是離開國民革命的最後目標，還有一段遙遠的距程，民族主義尚未澈底完成，民權主義剛剛開始，民生主義根本未實行；而且在我國建國復興的途中，依然滿佈了障礙和荊棘。今天紀念先烈慶祝靑年節，行憲首屆國大開幕，凡我同人都應該正視現實，深切反省，以求全國朝野的大徹大悟，速謀革新更生的大計。</p>
<p>第一，今日政府最重要的工作，是戡亂建國，將來的民選政府，其唯一的基本任務，也是　亂建國：而且共匪在國內所散播的亂源，如若不能戡平及根除，則建國工作也就無從進行。但是怎樣戡亂始不致愈戡愈亂？蔣主席於廿七日發表聲明稱：「今日國家局勢，至爲嚴重：共匪毒燄，如此囂張。唯有我全國仁人志士共同維護憲法之尊嚴，確立民主政治之基礎。亦唯有我全國愛國民主黨派共同遵循政黨政治之軌轍，互讓互諒，通力合作，成立憲政政府，遵守憲法，負起保障入民自由，執行基本國策，保持國家領土主權之重責，始能克服艱危，完成戡亂建國之使命」·從蔣主席這個昭示看來，也可以知道，政洽民主化，實爲我國戡亂建國唯一的康莊大道。目前我國政治的「貪汚無能」，爲「豪門」「官僚」所操蹤，已成爲不可否認的事實，人人都　覺到有澈底改革的必要·依照民主國家的辦法，改革政治的步驟；第一是開放言論，廣徵民意，致府對內對外不論採取何　措置，都要以民意爲依歸；第二是擴大民主某礎，羅致國內賢能，不論是中央政府或是地方政府，都要實行「用人唯賢」的最高原則，澈底排除官僚政治；第三是行政制度化，不僅要實行分層負責，而且也要確立文官制，以增進行政率。誰都知道剿匪戡亂，是三分軍事七分政治，政治的澈底革新，實爲完成戡亂的必要條件，但願此次國大閉幕民選政府成立後，卽能大刀闊斧，改革政治，面目一新，與民更始。</p>
<p>第二，戡亂必先研究亂源的由來，共匪氣燄的高漲，固然由於政府在勝利之初誤於和談，坐失時機，聽任共匪的擴張勢力與地盤，但自政府明令戡亂以來，也將近一年，可是共匪的實力未見削弱，而其作亂的區域反見擴大，目前國內頗有愈戡愈亂的現象，其癥結何在？實在值得我們的重視。今日中國好像患着一身毛病，我們千萬不能「諱疾忌醫」，而應該潛心診斷，以根究其病源何在？然後飴可對症發藥。據我們深切反省所得，造成目前嚴重局勢，除了政治的貪汚無能而外，最重要的因素，乃在國民黨的政府雖然信奉國父的三民主義，但只知坐而言，不知起而行，尤其是國父的民生主義，對於都布經濟旣有節制資本的辦法，對於農村社會又有平均地權的主張，以達到「耕者有其田」的理想。這些有利於國針民生的經濟改革方案，都未能切實施行，反而被共匪所竊取，以「小資本主義」和「土地改革」相號召，不要說一般無知的農民會盲從，就是外國的記者也誤信共匪是一個主張「士地改革」的政黨。國民黨的這一失策，是不能不承認的，而且也不能不深切反省的。爲今之計，唯有急起直追。痛下決心，立卽實行國父的民生主義，以解除大多數人民的痛苦。全國各地，不論在緩靖區或在後方，甚至在京滬區，都已到了「民不聊生」的階段，民生的安定及改善，早已刻不容緩的了，好在「饑者易爲食，渴者易爲飲」，只要政府能痛下決心，不顧一切障礙，實行民生主義，是非常容易見效的·</p>
<p>第三，戡亂建國固然要靠政府的努力，但是如若沒有人民的協助，也是不易成功的。誰都知道中國是一個農業社會，老百姓大多數沒有知識；根本不知政治爲何物，卽使自己的生活痛苦，對於國是有意見，也不知道如何表達。所以中國的民主政治與其他各國的情形，逈然不同，目前我國需要無我無私的知識靑年，能够體念大多數人民的疾苦，替他們設想，替他們說話，一方面表達民意，爲政府施政的依歸，另一方面，團結而成一種力量，促督政府，革新進步，使政府官吏眞正能成爲人民的公僕。所以我們瞻望這次國大開幕之後，依照憲法民選的政府即將成立，我們一方面預祝國大成功，另一方面並希望全國的知識青年，大家站起來，檢討國是，　察民情，代表人民說話，督促政府，澈底革新，實行政治的民主化，經濟的社會化，早日完成戡亂建國的任務！</p>

<h3>主席告全國青年書</h3>
<p>審思明辨　認清國家敵人</p>
<p>（上接一版）第一，靑年們應審思明辨，認淸國家敵人，青年應當有熱烈的情感，同時應當有豐富的理智，今天靑年們悲憤煩悶的原因，誠然不止一端，有的爲國家多災多難而煩悶，有的爲經濟失調而煩悶，有的爲政治不合理想而煩悶，有的爲社會惡　與個人前途而煩悶，實際上我們當前主要的急務，無過於肅淸共匪，　滅共匪。因爲共匪是阻礙國家復興，擾亂社會秩序，斷絕人民生計，妨害政治革新的最大阻力。共匪一天不勦滅，靑年們就一天沒有光明的出路，共匪是國家的敵人，也就是你們靑年的敵人，共匪和共匪的工具利用你們，欺騙你們，斷送你們的種種鬼蜮技倆，在去年一年各種學潮中，表現得也够深刻了，誰造成你們生活的艱困，誰挑撥你　　生的情感，誰脅制你們不許有表達意見和個人行動的自由，　　送你們大好的光陰，破壞你們求學的環境，我想你們自己應該有淸楚的判斷，所謂「職業學生」，整年整月不上課，永遠不畢業，混入你們的　伍以內，盜竊你們的名義，迷惑你們的視聽，强制你們的行動，擾亂你們的秩序，你們對之應該有明晰的認識。我愛國青年們，國家是如何培育你們，社會是如何期望你們，而共匪却不承認你們有獨立的人格，　把你們當作物，不把你們當作人，要利用你們做他叛國害民的工具，這是何等不可忍受的侮辱·你們若是漢視了共匪的罪惡，寬容了共匪的存在，那就是中國革命靑年光榮歷史的汚點，因之，我喚起你們務必審思明辨，認淸共匪就是你們自己的敵人，爲了國家，爲了被殘害的同胞，你們應該擁　　　，剷除共　，爲了保持你們的純潔，洗霉你們的恥辱，表示你們　年人的勇敢，你們更應該團結奮起，在你們隊伍中肅清共匪。</p>
<p>刻苦勤勞　力求學業進步</p>
<p>第二，靑年們要刻苦勤勞，力求學業進步，我們中國要立國於現代國際社會，必須完成各種的建設，求取學術文化的向上，現在是科學的時代，科學改變了自然，科學增進了人類的福利，這次大戰以後，科學對於人類命運的關係，更是重大，但是科學的發達，都是從一點一滴不斷研究中得來，絕不是一朝一夕可以徼倖而致的。道十年以來，我們在抗戰艱苦之中，學術研究的工作，仍然有相當的成績，這不能不歸功於學術界的努力，然而我們要發達產業，完成建設，充裕國計民生，則在科學研究方面不僅是水準太低，而且是數量太少，我全國靑年必須有迎頭趕上的決心，孜孜兀兀，心不旁驚，在敎室，在實臉室，在圖書室，在工廠，在　　專心致志於科學的研求　技　的改　，　　儘管困難，我們總要努力不　，追上時代，求取進步，這是福國利民的偉大職責，希望有志青年們毅然承當起來。</p>
<p>守法崇紀　樹立民主楷模</p>
<p>第三，靑年們要守法崇紀，樹立民主楷模，我國現在已進入民主憲政的階段，民主的具體實現，不是只靠一套制度或形式，主要的還在全國都能具有法治的習慣，瞭解自由的分際，自政府以至於社會，人人守法，事事守法，乃可以達成完美的憲政，使全國同胞受到眞正的福利。我全國靑年是領導改革的先鋒，是國家未來的基幹，更應該有守法祟紀的精神與尊重他人自由的民主風度，像去年一年學潮中所表現的，則是學校比之社會更混亂，若千存心搗亂的共匪分子和甘心受人指使的靑年，自居於特殊的階級，自外於國家的法紀，師長可以侮辱，校規可以破壞，同學可以脅迫，甚至他人和他校的自由可以橫加干涉，這種現象，幾乎要使廿世紀向民主大道違進的中國拉回到原始肚會，專尚暴力的時代，實在不是現代中國靑年所宜有，切望我靑年猛省自身對國家對民族神聖的責任，改正觀念，革新生活，祟尚理智，尊重秩序，樹立起整然不　的學風，然後社會的風習得以轉移，眞正的民主纔可實現。</p>
<p>正視現實　繼承先烈精神</p>
<p>全國靑年們，現在我們的國家和國民又面臨着一個大考驗的時代，我們的國家能否獨立自存，我們的民族能否繁榮滋長，都要看我們能不能團結全國愛國人民的力量，能不能掃除統一建國的障礙，能不能勦滅共匪的叛亂，能不能實行我們立國原則的三民主義，證之過去歷史，凡是靑年們信仰一致，行動一致，意志集中，力量集中的時候，就是我們國家戰勝艱難，開闢光明的時候。祇要我們能繼承革命先烈爲國獻身的精神，體會靑年節偉大的意義，正視現實，負荷艱鉅，忍勞耐苦，積極奮鬥，那我們就不僅能保持先烈們艱難　造的光榮史續，更必能消除匪患，　　障碍，建造一個三民主義富强康樂的新中國。</p>

<h3>馬卿率代表團赴波哥大　泛美會議明啓幕　將討論西半球反共條約</h3>
<p>〔路透社波哥大廿八日電〕泛美會議定於下星期二在此由哥倫比亞總統貝萊士正式揭幕。美國代表團除由馬歇爾親自率領外，並有財長史奈德，商長哈里　，進出口銀行會計長馬丁，駐巴西大使保萊等陣容堅强無匹。危地瑪拉所提要求結束英·法·荷·　在中南美洲殖民地之案，將在會中提出討論。惟關係方面預料，美國，阿根廷，　利，委內瑞拉等均將反對此議，認爲不宜於國際局勢緊張之今日，因此防　西方盟國與西半球之團結。　西哥，巴西，哥倫比亞及大部份中美國家，對於危地　拉，阿拉維洛總統之政府有　疑者，預料亦可支持美國。此外美國之政策，可能爲要求大會成立廣泛的經濟憲　，以減輕貿易的限制，開放私人投資途徑</p>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓廿七日電〕美國帮辦國務卿亞　爾今日飛往哥倫比亞城　　大，參加　美會議。高級美國代表之先　部隊亦已離此　，國務卿馬歇爾，商長哈　受今日午　亦　此問。馬歇爾表示，雖國際局勢緊張，渠仍計　出席整個會議，會議期　爲六星期至兩個月，然馬氏亦計劃必要時飛返華府。</p>
<p>〔合衆社　哥大廿八日電〕汎美會議將於三十日啓幕，籌備人員因哥倫比亞缺乏電力，而此間電訊設備又部份失效，因此大感　躇。哥國發生六個月之酷羊，致以料供應已近　竭，而水力　電力　減，致會議舉行時恐將借用美國陸軍之趨托發當機。此間與北美中美　報僅一綫，最近毀損，電訊僅賴無綫電機三架維持。</p>
<h3>美三軍職權確定　陸軍後備官佐奉命保留　勃蕾特萊今夏出巡太平洋區</h3>

<p>〔路透社華盛頓廿七日電〕陸軍部今日透露：後備現役官佐二萬名，原已圈定將行復員者，將繼續其職位，以待國會之議決征兵。各就原位：秘密命令，係於本週初頒發。</p>

<h3>距金門六十哩處　發現怪潛艇</h3>
<p>〔聯合社舊金山廿七日電〕海軍當局今日宣稱：茲據泛美航空公司飛剪號駕駛員梅友報吿，謂於今日拂曉前在舊金山在距金門（美國最大海軍基地之入口）西南約六十哩之海面，發現國籍不明之潛水艇一艇，旋即下沉，海軍已派　多架出動搜索。該區並無　　水艇駐留，報吿如果　實，此項潛水艇決非美國所有。先是，海軍界人士雖曾猜測或係正在演習之美潛水艇「鯉魚」號，但「鯉魚」號現仍停泊於蒙特灣內。</p>
<h3>美專家分析　蘇實力雄厚</h3>
<p>〔中央社紐約廿七日電〕紐約時報軍事分析家鮑爾汶稱，蘇聯之陸軍優越，且其領土毘西歐東亞，故一旦戰事發生時，蘇聯可迅速席　歐洲。朝鮮·中東，東北與華北。據紫對蘇聯軍力有研究之鮑氏稱。若蘇軍與其附庸國家軍隊於明日發動政勢，則彼等可於數日內或數週內佔領朝鮮，三月內可達黃河流域，四十五日內可佔領奧·魏·法·德·丹·荷·比·嗷等國。鮑氏稱，雖然蘇聯陸軍强大，其數量達九十四帥，但其裝配則較遜，尤其缺乏飛機與船隻。蘇聯刻正協助改善其附庸過之軍隊，使其標準化。彼認爲蘇方確在準備未來之大戰，但其是否將發動實際侵略乎？鮑氏認爲蘇方經濟工業計劃表示長期準備，而非爲緊急準備。且蘇方以政治主義經濟與煽動叛亂之方法，刻正獲得車大成就，故在蘇聯以上術方法大獲其利時，將不致　戰爭之危險。</p>
<h3>蘇聯態度難捉摸　芬人感詫異　疑尚有錦囊妙計</h3>
<p>〔路透社海爾辛基廿八日電〕莫斯科在蘇分條約談判中所取之政策，尚難令芬蘭方面捉摸。蘇聯方面行動之遲緩，已使芬人感覺詫異，然蘇聯袖中之尚有妙計，殆己無所疑義。視察家已有相信一週來華盛頓方面之堅强表示已產生若干作用者。彼等相信蘇聯可能將因此調整其在北歐之政治戰略，以應付在警戒狀態中之美國。同時芬蘭消息靈通方面人士頃否認芬蘭已减少其對蘇聯壓力的抵抗之說。芬政府今日曾打破復活節休息之傳統習慣，舉行非正式會議，討論莫斯科方面可能的發展。芬政界人士相信蘇聯迄尚未曾將其要求攤明桌上，此等現　反使芬人感覺詫異。預料莫斯科之談判或將隨時有新發展。</p>
<h3>邊境軍事活動事　蘇拒伊抗議</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕舊金山廿八日廣播：關於蘇軍在伊朗邊境活動事，伊政府曾向蘇万提出抗議。現據悉，蘇聯已答復伊方，對於伊朗抗議予以拒絕，謂所稱蘇聯軍事活動一節，純係神怪故事。</p>

<h3>捷克斯洛伐克軍火工業　全部入蘇聯掌握　使與羅保等國聯成一經濟單位</h3>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓廿七日電〕共產在捷克發動政變以後，使蘇聯緊握兩次世界大戰作爲歐洲兵工廠之規模龐大的斯柯達軍火工業。軍事尃家稱，蘇聯於紅軍開入捷克之時，業已獲得其對斯柯達軍火工廠所欲達到之實際目的。此間從事佔計共黨及反共然勢力範圍內之戰爭　力之人，早已不視斯柯達爲西方國家可能之戰爭潛力之資產。共黨兩週以前之奪取政權，更使渠等之估計確切不移。</p>
<p>按斯柯達工廠包括卅五大廠，生產一切器械，自犂頭·曳引機起直至小型武器及大砲爲止。自一九三二年至三七年希特勒接收以前，斯柯達廠生產世界百分之十四軍火輸出，希特勒後更加以擴充。斯柯達目前並未完全改變爲平時之農具·鐵道及工業器材之生產，該廠現仍接受蘇聯·伊朋·瑞典·阿根廷·南斯拉夫及瑞士等國之軍備定單。據消息靈通軍界人士稱，佛塞丁柴伯羅國夫卡工廠單獨一家每月生產二千五百萬發之七·九二　口徑子彈·五百萬枚雷管·卅萬發之二十糎砲彈·二萬枚火箭彈及一千枝向倫式步槍。斯柯達之工業生產包括農業機器·鐵路車頭及車輛，自戰後以來，大部份皆運往蘇聯者。捷克之第一項軍略重要性，即爲其工業及礦產資源。該國有基本原料及動力資源，可供無限工業開發之用。除開其豐富之鐵礦貯存量及鋼鐵工業可與薩爾河流域相比擬以外，捷克尚有供原子能及原子彈生產用之重要原素　礦貯藏，捷克鈾井之一切生產皆輸入蘇聯。據消息靈通方面稱，蘇聯欲將捷克之工業潛力，與波蘭·匈牙利及羅馬尼亞·南斯拉夫·阿爾巴尼亞及保加利亞等國發生聯繫，成功一經濟單位，不再依賴於西歐。</p>

<p>〔路透社日內瓦廿七日電〕美國代表頃向國際新聞自由大會提出，使新聞不受國家限制，並便利外國記者活動之國際公約。全文約共十六條，要點包括：（一）每一簽字國應准許其他簽字國之新聞，依最惠國基礎傅入本國，（二）非有軍事安全必要時，不得實施檢査延擱修改等措施；（三）任何一簽約國，得請另一簽約國以各種方法宣布事實眞相，以糾正外國記者錯誤的報道；（四）各外國記者對於新聞來源及各種處所，應有平等權利；（五）外國記者之出入，不得予以特別限制。美國此一建議將交大會之四委員會詳細研究。</p>
<p>蘇聯代表團不致提出關於整個新問自由問題之建議案，但蘇代表洛馬金今日表示，渠當提出建議以消滅隱匿狀態下之新聞檢査制。蘇代表團此外將建議制定取締戰販行爲之法律。法代表亦提出防止對外國記者歧視之公約，此外並建議設立世界新聞記者會，發給國際新聞記者證明文件。</p>
<p>〔中央社日內瓦廿七日合衆電〕菲代表波羅米歐吿新聞發表及採用自由委員會謂：菲決支持不顧種族國　，宗敎或政治關係，對新聞及言論自由，加以保陣之任何建議。渠謂吾人深知此種自由曾遭不負責人士所濫用。惟此種性質之濫用，已及時由與論本身予以矯正。惟有在管制輿論之制度下人民不擇自由思想，或暢所欲言，而亦即受管制之與論，始不能主動採取必需之矯正措施也。</p>
<p>〔聯合社日內瓦廿七日電〕聯合國新聞自由會議中，蘇聯，波蘭與匈牙利代表即席發言，猛烈攻擊美國報紙。匈代表引述美國參議員勃里奇之言，謂美國擬支援東歐之地下反共運動。</p>

<p>〔路透社　馬廿七日電〕義　領袖托格里亞蒂在此間向七萬民衆發表演說，指西方國家欲使義大利被拖入另一戰爭，以對抗蘇聯及東歐。渠請義人在四月十八日以選票制止美國及西方國家之此一政策，使其了解義大利決不依附戰爭的政策及不屬於義大利人民的利益。托氏堅決表示，人民民主陣綫必須以任何代價獲得勝利，蓋唯人民民主陣綫得以建立阻止出賣祖國者之堅固壁壘。托氏並提及特港問題，他說西方國家正力圖顯示共黨及社會黨之反對特港歸還義國，以痛起義人之民族運動，而使反動派得以戰勝民主勢力。然南斯拉夫已聲明願與民主的義大利檢討和約關於特港的絛款，英美法之不向南斯拉夫徵求意見，意欲保存義東疆問題，使其成爲大戰的導火綫耳</p>

<h3>迢迢長途眠不食　信鴿飛翔能力驚人</h3>
<p>天津飛返上海最高紀錄卅餘小時　每年選擇名門配偶強迫結婚數次</p>
<p>〔本報特寫〕兩次世界大戰中，在數不淸的戰役裏面，信鴿曾經克盡了最大的功能；圍剿丁鍚山一役，淞滬間的情報聯絡，也部份地依賴過信鴿。上海的信鴿數不在少，但除了軍用的以外，大多數還在充任着競賽的「職業選手」。儘管信鴿是不能生產的動物，民間飼養信鴿的人仍然興趣極濃，據說此中樂趣，遠勝欣賞蟋蟀相門，或是鳴禽獻唱多多。　判斷信鴿不能單純依靠外形，羽毛　美，氣宇軒昂，常是最不中用的東西，像名種「史太斯」，「比里金」等屬於比利時原始種的信鴿，外觀樸實無華，沉默少動，倒常能一飛驚人。這些「名鴿」現在從國外進口，時值是美金百元一對，賣主出售時必附贈「鴿子家譜」一張，曾高祖考，叔伯兄弟，備載無遺，飼養者一方面須爲它選擇系出名門的配偶，一年中强迫結婚數次，他方面更要爲它按代續譜，旁支正統，不能或誤，直至於老死。</p>
<p>保持　種　重視血統</p>
<p>信鴿的婚姻是　　者最為車視的，因爲要使優秀血統繼續保持，他們對鴿子的門閥族系，經常區分極　，族系不同的不能結合，族系太近而有血統關係的又不能結合，否則品種繁衍混雜，次代鴿子的智慧與飛翔力便要顯著减退。戰後日軍軍用信鴿在移交前把育種紀錄表燒燬，後來一部份優秀的信鴿轉輾流落民間，因爲無法査考它的祖先源流，飼養者祗能爲其草草成婚，經過這種「自由結合」後所孵出來的幼鴿，據統計在任何一方面，幾乎沒有一只能超越它上代的標準。</p>
<p>稟　不凡　建立　動</p>
<p>信鴿的出身在正式飛行時立可看出·信鴿協會理事奚葆儒有一只幼鴿，出生未到五個月，就從蕪湖一　飛返上海，後來放到京滬杭兩路沿綫　埠起飛，歷次都成績優異，並且從未迷途。翻着它的身世，原來父親是SHC（戰前上海信鴿協會簡稱）從溫州飛返上海的選手,母親更偉大了，民國二十六年會在SHC麾下從鳳陽飛返過上海，禀賦不凡，所以纔建立殊勳。還有勝利後一次信鴿競賽，從無錫飛出獲得亞軍的一只幼鴿，它的父親曾由海門飛返上海，母親據說也是長飛能手，一門數傑，在鴿子的家庭裏是會經常發現的。　中國信鴿長途飛行的最高紀錄，是李梅齡的一只鴿子，在戰前曾由天津飛返上海，時間是三十餘小時，到現在止，尚未有任何鴿子擊破這個紀錄·現在上海共有老鴿八千餘只，幼鴿近四千，其中一部份具有水準以上成績的，都曾在標準時間三時半以內從南京飛返上海，並不比飛機航行速率遜色。</p>
<p>由燕湖放歸之五個　幼鴿</p>
<p>蘇洲崑山　最難辦認</p>
<p>幼鴿孵出需十八日，一月半以後就能訓練飛行，訓練方法是由近而遠，普通先放它在市區上空觀察一番，據說鴿子在這時候就能辨定窠的方位，距黃浦江幾何，離國際飯店若干，一　以後，永不忘記：接着飼養者便把它帶赴南翔，崑山，沿京滬，津浦各站北上，或是順嘉，杭，溫，厦南下，愈去愈遠。這當中京滬綫上蘇州和　山兩站，是鴿子智慧能力的最大考驗地，因爲湖沼密佈，地形難認，較為低能一點的信鴿是十分之十難向老巢的，倘是逾此而上，飛翔點能到達無錫，那麼不帝選手資格已經獲得，在正式競賽中就可參預一顯身手了。</p>
<p>疾趨而下　宛如轟炸</p>
<p>信鴿的堅毅耐苦和忠誠，是小動物最值得稱道的，任它多麼遼遠的長途，它總是不食，不眠，不休，途中有風雨，它就低飛，遇到　隼，它就避　，不分畫夜，終至扺達故巢而後已。有人曾經用望遠鏡觀察信鴿長途歸來的姿態，它　翔在雲層之上，一旦發現目標，就兩翅收攏，疾趨而下，宛如俯衝轟炸，英勇而又沉着。</p>
<p>養尊處　　備受殊榮</p>
<p>戰前上海信鴿協會以及標準信鴿會的鴿子，對抗戰中傳遞情報，都曾有過不少　獻，勝利後信鴿協會改組成立，一百餘會員幾乎全是數　來寢饋於飼養鴿子的人，他們在家中大都建有　備相當富麗的鴿棚，衛生設備　自動開閉門窗之外，還有電　板一方，是專供競賽時作紀錄時間之用的·這些鴿子在僅有的十五年壽命中，飲貪有節，運動有時，平時養尊處優，等到展翼　　宵，記錄吿成，還要承受一塲榮譽的獎　，這在大多數辛勞一生，終日爲衣食奔走的人類看來，這種幸福　直是有點近乎　侈了。</p>
<p>由蕪湖放歸之五個月幼鴿</p>
<h3>可疑金融機構　實施突擊檢查</h3>
<p>金融局會同警局即日展開工作</p>

<h3>捕二百餘人　將解特刑庭</h3>
<p>此次軍警當局在滬破獲大規模之共匪機關，被捕已達二百餘人，當局日內　將公布經過詳情。被捕各人，並擬送特種刑庭審理。據大公社記者探悉：共匪本擬於本年五一勞動節，在滬發動五罷一難運動（罷工·罷課·罷市·罷敎·罷崗·及難民暴動），以配合蘇北共匪軍事行動之開展。是以蘇北共匪高倡「五月渡江」之口號，即爲與上海共匪之陰謀遙相呼應，現在其首腦組織旣經當局破獲，五罷一難之夢想，亦吿粉碎。茲特將共匪之五罷一難計劃，揭　於後：</p>
<p>罷工</p>
<p>自申九慘案發生後，共匪即利用該案，策動其市委會下之勞工幹部，四出以募捐慰勞申九死傷工人爲名，作反政府之宣傳，並再提出取消工資折扣之口號。自首之三區絲織業工會理事長陶雲山，及該會之共黨分子沈默，泰康罐頭食品公司工人楊明（女性），二區針織業光華廠胡秀娟，康福廠潘雪珍，陸秀英等（以上各人均被捕）及公用事業機器業中之若干份子，對此事活動甚力，擬擴大搗亂，造成全市總罷工。罷課在學運方面，擬繼續製造九龍事件之空氣，再策動大中學生及其家屬，以不堪負担學費爲名，發動請　威運動，最後　到　課目的．</p>
<p>罷市</p>
<p>今春共匪曾頒發所謂中共民運工作指示，其中對於商運万面，指示其在滬之　伏幹部，應配合工運　運，重建核心，並以「抵制美貨」，「發動拉稅」二口號，作爲活動中心，藉以實現聯合罷市運動。</p>

<h3>陳納德將軍　論美國對華政策</h3>
<p>克里浦斯霍華特系報業聯合會版權所有　本報編譯室譯</p>
<p>（二）兩種相互呼應的特點</p>
<p>中國目前政治與軍事局勢，大部份是由美國官方鼓勵中國共黨和妨碍中國中央政府所促成。</p>
<p>在我們戰時與中國中央政府聯盟的四年中，這種現象到了中葉的時候，如同奇葩怒茁，而從此盛開甚久—我以爲是太久了。</p>
<p>我們對武裝反叛衆所承認的政府的鼓勵，以及我們對該政府的吹毛求疵運動，也是同樣奇突的遙相呼應，這種吹毛求疵運動，始于有益批評的錯誤，一方面，轉而降爲直率的誹謗。</p>
<p>我們政策上這兩種相互呼應的特點，很明白是符合了共黨同路人的意願，即使事實上這並不是他們在戰時重慶和其他地方活動的結果。</p>
<p>我們政策直接受到同路人的淆惑已至什麽程度，我現在不能說。我旣然對結果比動機更爲關心，無論如何我認爲這是一個理論的問題。事實上，中美合作的破壞者所期望到的成功，已比他們本身能够達成的更大。滿足此一期望的美國官員，已做了同路人的工具。</p>
<p>我並不是說負責的美國官員故意的在重慶玩着共黨把戲，但是我的確指責他們已進了共黨的圈套，而且因爲這樣的做，曾經中傷了我們與中國中央政府在戰爭危急階段的合作，而幾乎要永遠中傷下去。</p>
<p>對于戰時與戰後美國政策與中共妥協和綏靖的傾向，我祗能這樣的寫—關于綏靖中國共黨這一目標，現在很愉快的由杜魯門總統和馬歇爾國務卿予以否認，雖然這是最近才聽到的。</p>
<p>一方面在背後說中央政府的壞話，另一方面却拍着共黨的背，這種雙管齊下的玩意，符合了而且帮助促成一九四四年自由中國的政治危機。假使在那時候不是蔣委員長把史迪威將軍驅逐出去，這種危機幾乎必定終于摧毀了那時候的中美共同努力。</p>
<p>我們現在逐一討論那時候美國政策的爾種情形—其一是美官万對戰時盟友不同情的奇觀，其二是我們與中國赤色者「公開談愛」的相互因素。</p>
<p>在魏德邁將軍于一九四四年接替史迪威將軍之前，美方與中國政府的參謀諮商，幾乎繼續是過度的壓力和恫嚇，事實上，這祗是象徵史迪威和他的幹部對一位中國領袖的過低的估計，而這位領袖，在珍珠港事件以前，已經抵抗日本四年之久。</p>
<p>那時候，我們對華的軍事與外交關係的類似，是很明顯的，即使軍事的一方面並沒有那樣奇突，這一種的雷同，也是可以預料到的。在這部回憶錄中，就直接討論後者而言，我是比較的有準備。</p>
<p>美國領袖似乎不能在互想諒解，互相協助與互相尊敬的基礎上與中國人民相處。「一個中國士兵，假使給予適當的訓練，配備與供養，是能够打仗的」，—這種見解，說了又說，也就是史迪威及其部下對中國人民信心所能表達的最大的徵象。</p>
<p>這種於事無補的說法，疊惑了許多美國戰地記者，而且好像把史迪　當做了中國的恩人。事實上，這種說法，已低估了中國的潛力，幾乎是一種誹謗。</p>
<p>好像是有計劃的策謀一樣，美國對中國中央政府及其附屬機構，（包括軍隊）的估計，在凡是美國人士集會的地方，都已成爲話柄。一方面，在其他地方的美國士兵都奉令避免談論中國政府，但在另一方面，在重慶的美軍官對於中國政府的實際或是莫須有的缺點，却絲毫不放鬆的背誦出來，而成了一種被核准的習慣。</p>
<p>即使所說的是事實，這些唸唸有詞，已經超過了普通任意說話的範圍，何况並不是事實，所以這已够說明他們不謹愼與毫無思慮的至深且鉅。</p>
<p>司令部人員與美國戰地記者的接觸頻繁，（大部份是非正式的）增加了這種大量生產的對華批評。不僅是美軍，而且連同記者在內，他們在中國都是中國政府的賓客，而這一政府却時常被抨擊，對於這一點，他們好像很少介意。</p>
<p>我的空軍司令部在昆明，但時常都到重慶的戰區司令部去。每一次赴渝，如果我要聽，我總是可以聽到這種運動的回聲。這不能被視爲一種竊竊私語運動——它是太過響亮了。</p>
<p>史迪威在重慶從不接見美國記者，但是他的不恭敬意見，總是在私人談話　是新聞會議中以「不得發表」的名目供給記者。從一位於一九四三年末到渝的記者那裏，我得到一個例子。他在「不得對外發表」的談話中，詢問史迪威，中國那時候最需要些什麽去繼續作戰。</p>
<p>對於這一問題，史迪咸簡單的答稱：「嚴密撰擇一百個頭顱，把它們殺光」。</p>
<p>史迪威將軍對蔣委員長的低微估計，時常都表露出來。我想起其中最重要的一個例子。</p>
<p>一九四三年春天，羅斯福總統在華府召開參謀聯席會議，我奉命出席，邱吉爾亦在塲，羅斯福總統要求史迪威對中國局勢，作一概述。史起立猛烈抨擊蔣委員長，說委員長不可靠，不知感恩，不誠摯，而不忠實。羅斯福先生打斷了他的演說，問道：「陳納德，你對此有何感想？」我立起來吿訴他們說：在我留華這許多年，委員長從未在任何方式下對我失信。我認爲他是一個偉人，也是能使中國團結的唯一領袖。」</p>
<p>這一次，史迪威將軍與我的評語，都在白宮筆錄之內。</p>
<h3>興安號　接艦啓示</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿六日訊〕美國的人工是貴的，在「加工加錢（More　work，more　pay）」的口號下，兩天工錢相當我們接艦士兵一月薪餉的包工的效率大可懷疑，而承修包商的成績更難提起。十一月七日「興安號」從新奧爾良港駛出，約計一週過了巴拿馬運河，發現左主機有一個裂口漏水，每天要滲進來九百多加侖的水，沒辦法只好一面排水一面走，靠近聖誕節到了舊金山焊修了兩星期，但駛出去不過一畫夜又漏水，再度駛回舊金山重修後續航，可是，無論如何，年邁的引擎是應該大修的了，不上三天，左主機繼續漏水，美方知道不能再對付，才在珍珠港進行大修，停留了四十天，替左主機換了個外套，到今年二月十八日離開了珍珠港，經橫須賀駛回國門。</p>
<p>「興安號」的滿載噸位是三九一九噸，艦身長三二八呎，寬五十　，髹成銀灰色，巍巍的椗泊在下　江面。站在上面除了船頭甲板崎嶇不平創痕宛然外，我們很難想像它以前破舊的模樣，但上面所叙述的修理經過舉竟是眞實的。當桂永淸將軍從徐艦長手中接過那厚厚一本接收報吿時，無疑的他也接受了那九十九員官兵九個月身歷的種種辛勞和痛苦；同時爲了中國新海軍又多一粒新棋子，他對他們的卓越成績衷心表示佩慰。</p>
<p>返國途中　處處歡迎</p>
<p>「興安號」返國途中，從新奧爾良出發，經過古巴京城哈瓦那（Habna），巴拿馬運河區的科倫（Colon）和巴爾波亞（Bolboa），墨西哥的阿卡浦爾柯（Acapulco），美國的舊金山，珍珠港和日本的橫須賀等共處港埠。沿途雖因爲不是正式訪問不曾預先通知華僑，但臨時所受到的歡迎情况依然盛大熱烈。接艦官佐多是三十五年太康等八艦的舊人，兩年前的情况，再次展開在他們眼前，各地僑胞發現了　着祖國旗幟的軍艦停泊在港灣里，會自動的駕舢舨登艦參觀，絡繹不絕，流迎忘返，艦上來賓簽名册上已寫上了成千谷地僑胞的名字。</p>
<p>華僑在各地仗着他們堅强的生活力，多半白手起家動謹度日，但在祖國軍艦訪臨他們居留地時，不惜傾　出炎開盛大的歡迎會，甚至拍攝電影留念。這充分表示他們眷念祖國的赤誠，祖國軍艦帶給他們溫暖和驕傲，他們很少回國機會，登臨懸有靑天白日滿地紅旗幟的軍艦便好似登臨國土，所以他們感激中國海軍，愛護中國海軍。這次「興安號」的官佐常被華僑問起前年關於太康等八艦走私的謠言的事，當他們知道謠言全屬子處，被中傷的軍官都是無辜的而且仍繼續在海軍光榮的服役時，他們吐了一口悶氣。所以說到那些無的放矢惡意中傷的謠言時，徐艦長認爲：</p>
<p>「這不僅是一兩個海軍官員或一兩條軍艦的淸白問題而已，這關係到整個國家的榮辱。」</p>
<p>在「興安號一駛近國門的時候，我們的海關通知海軍總司令部說：「據報：興安軍艦自美携來大批私貨，請密切注意檢査。」桂永淸將軍便命令「興安號」直駛南京椗泊下關江心，未經他檢閱不得靠岸，結果「興安號」是全然淸白的。</p>
<p>一個啓示　人必自助</p>
<p>「興安號」是美援中的一小部分，但在以目前美國援華時勢作背景看來，「興安號」的獲得，修理與運用，正啓示着一個不移的道理，就是：</p>
<p>「人必自助！」</p>
<p>「興安號」不過是一艘美國海軍業已報廢了的製作粗陋的中型以下的舊戰車登陸艦改裝成的登陸修理艦，但對於我們仍是大有用處，船上修理艙里的工具機包括鑽床，鐵床，刨床和焊接設備，修理普通船隻是綽有餘力，這筆財產估起價來也是相當可觀。美國憑一紙協定就把它還有和它類似的大大小小，新新舊舊的船艦一共二百七十一艘慷慨讓贈給我們，無論如何總是高情厚誼。所以，即使「興安號」再破些，中國人不能說有甚麼不應該，中美海軍協定里對　贈船艦加一句形容詞，就是說就簽約時船停的地方與存毀的情况交接，說不定現在還有些破船等不到接收就已沈到海底去了，隨便我們把它如何處現都好。</p>
<p>「興安號」在新奥爾良港修理的時候，美國海軍曾經給予種稱修理，補給和航行方面的協助，徐艦長在記者招待會報告時曾特別提出申謝。但實際上美國人一直認爲中國的窮海軍對這條破船期望太高，冷眼比熱心似乎還多些，借用工具，添置器材，遭受的困難，實在難以罄述。同時，正趕上魏德邁將軍以特使身份來華調査的前後，美國輿論雖有一小部分主張援華，大部分仍是反對的，接艦官兵恰好聽到美國朝野對援華的爭辯，保守性的美國南部各州把聯邦政府的援華措施大肆責難，不但訊爲借款給中國是完全送給貪官汚吏糟塌，就是那些難望有多大用塲的待修破舊軍艦讓贈中國政府海軍也是浪費。在這種情况下，接艦人員爲了達成任務，除了要克服工具器材的短少和種種唯中國工人所能支持的勞苦外，更須忍受精神上的壓抑，接受援助本身原就是一件沉重的負祖。</p>
<p>一艘「興安號」的獲得，修理與運用，困難如是，虧賴我們新海軍九十九員接艦官兵盡心竭力，方能化腐朽爲神奇，把　　孚箱變成更能帮助別的艦隻的海上修理廠，這一事實嚴肅的昭示我們「設非自助，人助如無。」</p>

<h3>真美善教育與現代青年　為卅七年青年節作</h3>
<p>— 顧毓琇</p>
<p>在每一個文化到完成的時候，社會缺少了想像力。死板，重複，燦爛的鑑賞力逐漸减退，一切隨俗。正統的學派遏止了「冒險」。</p>
<p>在這種文化的變換裏，怎樣可以挽回文化的衰頺呢？懷悌黑敎授鄭重地預先警吿：「只有思想跑到事實前面，新文化的變換纔可以很快的到來。民族的活力推進到想像的探險，　可以預籌實際的冒險。人類夢想未來的世界，到時候也許會實現」。</p>
<p>文化（或文明）代表一種人生的理想，此種理想與個人有關，亦與人羣（人的社會）有關。以往六個世紀，歐洲的文化步着前人的後　。希臘和羅馬的盛世，便是文明的標準。現世界進向一個新的生存階段。新的知識，新的技術，把事物的比例改變了。古社會特殊的理想過於「靜止」（Static），疏忽了全行列的機會。只注意古時候最好的名言同最大的成功，是不够的。　古的結果是靜止，後退（Repressive），心理習於頺廢。其實當年的希臘人並不靜止。他們比起同時的鄰人恰是不崇拜歷史的。他們懸想，冒險，喜歡新奇。我們倘若要做一件最不合於希臘精神的事，那便是抄　希臘的一切。從前的希臘人決不是抄襲者。</p>
<p>從社會學的研究，或對於人生的了解，我們必須注意：完成（Rerfection）靠靜止的維特是不可能的。前進（Advance）或腐敗（Decarence），乃是人類唯一可選擇的途徑。</p>
<p>文化（或文明），據現代大　學家懷悌黑敎授—他也許便是這時代最偉大的哲學家，去年十二月卅日逝世，—在「思想的探險」（Adventures　of　Ideas）書裏的第四部份所說，包括「眞」，「美」，「探險」，「藝術」，與「和平」。「眞」（Truth）乃是「現象」（Appearance）與「實在」（Reality）的一致。「美」（Beauty）乃是「和諧」（Harmony）的完成，而和諧乃是「主觀形式」（Subjective　Form）細密（Detail）及綜合（Synthesis）的完成。主觀形式必須有「力」（Strength）；力的條件有二：碩大（Massiveness）與强烈（Intensity）。破壞亦有强烈的情感，但連背了和諧的原則。「美」較「眞」的觀念爲廣，但「眞」可以促進美感。「善」與「惡」不是藝術的目的，他們只與世事相關迎。世界在美的時候，亦便是善。科學與藝術，是對於「眞」與「美」有意的追求。</p>
<p>以歷代的聖哲來講，他們都追求眞善美的完全人生。他們便是眞善美敎育最好的榜樣。他們不但有豐富的知識，而且有超越的智慧。他們不但立己，而且立人；不但救人，而且救世；不但爲社會公道，而且求天下爲公；不但爲羣衆服務，而且求人類大同。「朝聞道，夕死可突」，便進於超凡入聖的境界。無論是眞理，道德，或藝術，美到極點便是聖，聖未有不至美的。至聖便是至美，便有至情。至美創造宇宙的莊嚴，至情產生人類的博愛。</p>
<p>現代靑年都應該負起挽回文化　頺的重任，眞美善的敎育是挽救世界頺風的偉大力量。</p>

<h3>一般物價　游資來源減少　物價漲風展緩</h3>
<p>陰曆年　後物價的激劇波動，到本月第二週，即三週前已達最高漸。那一週中由本會所編批發物價指數所見總指數，較前週上升百分之廿八·六，分類指數中食糧，紡織品及建築材料，均升百分之三十二以上。到前週及上週漲風已漸見展緩。前週物價總指數上升百分之六，分類指數中以進口貨扂多之化學品類上漲較多，這或許是受外匯調整的特殊影響，但亦不過百分之二十八·八。上週總指數上升僅百分之四·四，分類指數中以建築材料，金屬上升較速，餘如與民生關係較密之食料，紡織品上升較少。</p>
<p>最近二週來物價漲風之展緩原因甚多。舉其較重要者約有下列數端：第一，陰曆年關後上海物價飛漲，結果超出內地過巨，上海游資遂大量向內地流去，尤以車慶，成都，昆明爲多，造成最近二週渝昆各地物價之飛漲，而上海則因短期內游資之內流，而市塲資金較感短絀。第二，最近數週東北華北等地戰局之逆轉，促使上海工業設備及市塲資金之大量南流。資金之南逃，可由華南各地匯率最近之提高見之，此點對本市銀根之趨緊，自然亦有重要關係。第三，華北東北各地游資常由上述各地旅客携現來滬之方式流入本市。近來因以上各地戰况之轉趨激烈，而致交通受阻，近二週來南來船隻已見减少，本市游資因此又少一來源。第四，政府最近決定强迫微收救濟特捐，對一般富戶之有固定資產及囤積貨物者不無刺激，因固定資產及囤積貨物均易被檢査，故頗多售出以換取易隱匿之金融性物品者，此點對於市塲貨物供給之增加亦有相當影響。第五，陰歷年關後物價之激劇波動自然使交易中所需籌碼之墩額增加，因而相對地使銀根感覺緊促。</p>
<p>以上各種原因彙集之結果，上週銀根仍繼前週之一般　勢而有緊促之感，僅到週末略轉　和，此點與前週銀根鬆緊之變化頗相類似。上週初銀根較緊，物價較前週末普遍下跌，尤以紡織品爲甚。週三週四若干貨物皆達最低價，例如二十支雙馬紗每件低達一億元，四十二支藍鳳低達一億七千萬。白粳每石低達三百六十萬。但近週末時銀根轉鬆，貨價再見高翔，四十二支藍鳳週六再達二億一千萬。二十支雙馬高達一億二千六百萬。龍頭細布上升尤速，竟重登四百四十萬之高峯。白粳麥粉無不高翔上週與前數相同，燃料中以煤斤來源較旺及時令已過，化學品中如六九三硫化元時令關係價亦較穩。前者如焦作塊煤每噸穩定於一千四百萬，硫化元每桶穩定於五千二百萬之水準，甚少波動，爲各貨中較特殊之少數貨物。</p>

<h3>貨幣金融</h3>
<p>（一）銀根暗息</p>
<p>本市上週銀根，一般說來，異常緊　，各業缺單者，被逼紛紛出售以搜羅頭寸，致物價普見平疲而暗息亦高峯迭見。現鈔籌碼，上半週因流出者多而流入者少致枯竭非常。週一票據至深夜一時，頭寸尚未軋平，銀根之緊勢可以概見。但到了週三以後，　則因外部游資續有抵達，二則國家行局之交換差額在扣除商業銀仃的定存以後，反進爲出，致市塲　碼之供源增加，同業拆放亦因之轉見靈活，銀根緊象乃稍見和　，後半週雖銀根回緊轉鬆已微露曙光，但由於國家行局連續鉅進返物價下　未見劇烈，故頭寸仍普見吃香而證劵帮　利息甚至有高做四角以上者。</p>
<p>上週週一週二兩天，國家行局之　實　進均在二千億以上，週三以後則反進為出，週五之眞實差出，竟高達二千一百八十三億，創半月來行局實出的最高記錄。</p>
<p>洋商銀行差進之　，亦可謂前所罕見，自週一至週五五天以內，共計差進六千四百億，平均每天之差進在一千億以上，其間除一部份爲收回同業的拆放的款項外，游資南流的洶湧，亦頗堪注意。</p>
<p>商業行莊一週來之缺單頗爲普遍，六十號以後行莊自週一至週五五天內之差出高近二萬億，平均每天出數在三千億以上。一週來商業銀行繳解現鈔予央行以抵補單子者爲數甚少，每日平均不過四五百億，現鈔籌碼之桔竭，可見一二。</p>
<p>上週暗息，始終維持高盤不跌，最低爲三角三分，三角四分半最普遍，三角六分爲最高，證劵套利最高做到四角半一般則在四角左右，證劵帮多空貼息，則穩定於三角六分的永準。</p>
<p>（二）內外滙率</p>
<p>上週外匯行市基準率未變化　匯爲廿五萬五千元英鎊套匯率爲七十六萬五千元，香港申匯上半週平疲，維持在十萬法幣合港幣一元零二三分之間，週四放長爲一元二角七分，週五稍見報縮。</p>
<p>上週本市商業銀行內匯率普見降低，廣州匯水週一爲每千元三百元，至週五則已迭降至一百二十元厦門匯水之走勢亦同，週一爲三百元，週二降爲二百元，週五則再降至一百八十元。重憂匯水以週一與週三之每千元三十元最高，週五則已降至十元漢匯匯水雖自週一之一百十元一度升至週二之二百元，但此後又迭見下降，週五跌至一百元。天津貼水獨見增加週一爲每千元貼水三十元，週五則已增至五十元，資金自北方流來的　勢依萬。</p>
<p>（三）華洋股市</p>
<p>上週股市行情，在週四以前，幾呈一致　瀉局面，在金融界，一方面受了美貸可望通過的刺激，同時另一方面，市面上的銀根緊俏異常雖然有不少樂觀的人，認爲農貸發收工貸成功均在即日，而銀根不久就可轉鬆，但這樂觀的氣氛，終究敵不過眼前碼籌的如此短細，於是多方在無可奈何之下，不得不紛紛了售，換取頭寸，市上的散戶，亦寗願以頭寸參加套利，以坐收四角以上的利息，供多求少股市自然就一　不振了。不過這種現象也還是短促的，銀根的　勢到下半週已經和綏了，農貸的　放能否不變成游資呢，恐怕相當成問題加上短期庫券策二期已到結算之期了，因此週五以後股市又將回走它們好路了。華股如永紗週一以一八六〇元開盤，週四之晨盤，已瀉到一六五〇元了，同期內新光爲二四六與二二二之差別，景福爲二四四與二二一的差別，信誼爲三〇〇與二二〇的差別，但是週四午後已經由疲轉堅了，週五的午盤，永紗現期已回到過一的盤價，新光景福等週五午後收價亦已與週一的收價相差不遠，看來這局面恐又將維持一個時期了吧！</p>
<p>外股滙怡紗週一上午買價爲一百九十三萬，但週四下午已跌至一百六十五萬，會德豐同期內竟自五百萬跌至四百廿萬，英聯週一爲二百六十九萬，但週四下午不過二百三十萬，不渦週五像華股一樣，又回走高價了，怡紗下午達一百八十一萬，英聯二百四十八萬，會德應漲到四百七十五萬，似乎又將其週初之買價看齊了。銀根轉和與港匯趨緊會起了很大的影響。</p>

<p>關於輸出品原料進口事宜，輸管會曾於上月三日起分別召集有關各業，逐日會商，被召各業達卅二家，此項會議，已於本月二十日結束，據悉凡多廠商所需輸出之製造原料，即可按進口辦法開始申請，其所請求輸入製造原料之總值，未超過其製成品輸出總額百分之四十者，可先行批准，但附帶條款爲廠商在結購進口外匯時即須將輸出品總值全數結集指定銀行於此可見政府最終的目的仍在如何進一步獲得外匯頭寸。至於與外匯的獲得無關的工業，其原料的配額是否足够，或甚至完全不予配給，當局往往很少注意，這就引起了本市油脂公會國煉火油廠爲燃料柴油輸入之不敷分配而作控訴式的呼籲該會於上週二招待新聞界指責輸管會忽視提煉火油非柴油不可之事實並聲明國懷火油旣全恃柴油爲原料，柴油更爲輸管會所管理統制輸管會今不予核配，則與經濟部允予扶植之主旨相背馳云云。除此以外，上週更有搪瓷業因原料缺乏而請增加配額並低减配價以維生產的呼籲，總之，當局對於所謂不必要的進口實際即不能由此獲得更多外匯之進口，現在是盡可能加以抑阻，　　進　的物資確保民生工業所不可少者，則亦想盡種種方法，利用管制的機構去掌握這批物資或其所製成的商品，爲了達到這一目的經濟部近又飾工商輔導處擬　了一個如何控制工業品價務的意見，擬議中的意見認爲要控制成品的價格，應先設立物料總庫，由政府在國內外統購必需之原料，以備分配於民營各工業工廠，再以定貨貸款方式，貸實物收購成品，這樣，政府又可藉原料的統購而掌握一批物資了。</p>
<p>在須得指定銀行保證爲出口商及申請廠商先以總出口值之百分之四十結匯的兩原則下，輸出品製造原料的進口，已經開始申請與審査了，國際貿易促進會於是準備作進一步的打算，上週週三該會舉行座談會並擬議繕函輸管會，對原料品及農業副產品等之一般出口貨品亦按照工業品進口原料辦法，優待辦理，但據報　，當局方面認爲農業品要求與工業品原　進口辦法辦理，雖然是合理的，但目前政府情形，不能允許如此辦，問題的關鍵顯然在獎助農產品出口，是否能獲得充量之外匯，何况，政府對行將實施的收購七種出口物資的辦法，已經足够解決這個問題—獲取外匯—呢！</p>
<p>限制進口的另一例子即爲上週週四全經會所通過的限制化學產品進口的辦法，原案爲化學原料輸入限額照審査意見通過，即原則四十七類中，十九類可以自製者，將不予列入，九類可逐漸製造者，則改列附表三（甲）而减少其輸入量。</p>
<p>生產貸款的「幸」與「不幸」</p>
<p>關於本年生產貸款的數量及分配問題，本判各期，頗多綜合性的報導。本列上期曾指出在諸貸款中農貸最得天獨厚，其間糧食生產五萬億，棉花生產三萬億，竟佔貸款總額半數以上。此筆鉅大數字之農貸其　的除所謂在增加生產一　外、就怕就是掌握農產品物資了。臀如在農民銀行行務會議上，除決定本月份貸款總額爲一萬四千七百五十億而外更規定肥料種十將實物貸放辦法，其餘仍以貸現爲原則。此外據說爲代政府掌握物資起見，特在糧棉增產區，舉辦農倉，辦理農產品之儲押。又據中央合作金庫負責人談稱，該庫所分配到的三萬億農貸，令後仍邀照四聯總處核定方針，以糧食，棉花爲主，肥料，蠶絲，水利三種均擬實物貸放，肥料蠶絲兩種，並擬收回實物，肥料以豆餅貸放，收回食米，蠶絲先貸放　種，將來六成收實物，四成收現金。於此可見，這百分之六十的貸款，將來大部份要　成實物收回。這樣一個微妙與複　的貸放過程，的確如中農　總經理在其本年度農貸方針之書面文告中所說「每易受人批評」，同時除少數人以外恐怕任何人都希望此次農貸能確如李氏所申明的：「經過農民組織而達於個別農民，自不能法爲都市之　資，對物價發生不良之影響！</p>
<p>農貸雖然已經有了着落，出口貸款的細則却仍有待磋商，據進出　　會方面表示，第一，政府規定貸款數量以過去出口數量爲標準，但政府現擬擴大我國出口貿易，而貸款數量，却以過去出口數量為標準，對於出口商業務之擴大難免不無限制。第二貸款數量以一個月爲期結匯一次，並規定按月結匯貸款數量十分之一，未免缺乏彈性而且不能與出口物資外銷的季節性相配合，故希望當局加以修正云云。</p>
<p>出口　　之開放固已稍具　目，但工貸之是否開放却仍　無　訊，據工協發言人稱：自去年底迄今各業工廠除紡織業外，日益步入困難之境地中，據渠估計已有十分之三工廠工作機因種種原因在停工狀態　，致一般日用必需品之生產，較過去减少百分之四十左右，此點亦係物價狂漲之原因之一云。</p>
<p>日本的復興是中國的死敵</p>
<p>在本國的人民大部尚瀕於飢餓綫上掙扎的時候，却有大批大豆將運往日本解救日人的飢荒，據中央社束京廿二日專電，有　運大豆，豆餅，落花生三萬二千噸之中國船隻二艘，定於最近由華中及華北啓運去日，其　將載一萬四千噸雜糧（大部份係由漢口方面收購者）由上海運日，另一將載東北大豆一萬八千噸，由天津運日，這正與該社二十三日所傳，在美國政策下，再度形成農業中國，工業日本之消息相配合，據說美國方面可能於下一會計年度開始時七月間，俾於日本之借款計七億六千五百元萬美元，另悉美國現正議慮一項計劃，將日本經濟恢復至一九三四年之水準而一九四八年之生產目標，係規定達到三千六百萬噸煤斤，及一百萬噸鋼鐵，故無怪日本重要銀行聯合主席石川一郞及工業聯合會副主席佐籐喜一郞，已敢發表將來能擺脫外國資本家對日本工業之控制的言論了。</p>
<p>戰後日本的行將再度構成我國的威脅不但可見之於麥克阿瑟的政策中，而且日本近來對國際市塲的鐵隙中，亦可窺見其一二。據某出口業鉅子談及目前亞丁紗布市塲情形時稱，日本已步入國際貿易舞台，今後以大量紗布傾銷近東，恐勢所必然，據新亞社東京廿二日電訊，佔織物中大宗之紡綢之輸出，一二三三個月已逐次增加，迄今之輸出地，以紐約爲最多，次爲檀香山，最近對新嘉坡亦輸出三萬一千六百五十三匹，另據非正式統計，半年來日本運香港貨物，幾多於任何一地，與星洲相較，爲卅與一之比，此種鉅大日貨輸入，香港銷納數之限百分之八十，均係轉運往南洋各地。紗管會主委袁良於上週週三接見記者時亦曾提出一個月以後，日本紗布將向南洋一帶大量傾銷的警吿，則可知局面已經够嚴重了。</p>
<h3>北方烽火中　鋼鐵工業之透視</h3>
<p>我國鐵苗之生產量，在東北者每年達二百二十五萬七千噸之鉅，其他各省之總和，尚不逮其一半。戰前所產之鐵苗，百分之九十輸往日本。以鐵煉鋼，亦以東北爲中心，尤以東北之鞍山鋼鐵公司規模最大。戰前年產鋼五十三萬噸，淪陷時日人加緊增產，已超越百萬噸以上。其設備如四百噸之熔鐵爐，一百噸之平爐煉鋼，以及全部軋鋼配備，均極珍貴。反視其他各省之鋼鐵生產，則頗貧乏，可得而統計者如下：</p>
<p>（噸爲單位）</p>
<p>湖北　二一六、〇〇〇</p>
<p>安徽　一二〇、〇〇〇</p>
<p>湖南　二四〇、〇〇〇</p>
<p>山西　三二、〇〇〇</p>
<p>廣東　八〇、〇〇〇</p>
<p>四川　一〇八、〇〇〇</p>
<p>貴州　一二〇、〇〇〇</p>
<p>雲南　五六、〇〇〇</p>
<p>總計尚不滿一百萬噸。而今鞍山已失，亦祗有加强建設貧乏區域矣。於是華中華南，重獲靑睞，四川之綦江電化冶煉廠，將利用資渝煉鐵廠之十五噸煉鐵爐全套設備，復工產鐵。海南島鐵苗質量俱佳，去歲曾與日本訂定易貨商約，共計二十萬噸，已於月前運去。資源委員會主委翁文灝氏亦飛粤籌畫，擬即在廣州設立鋼鐵廠，俾利用海南鐵苗耳。湖北大治已成立華中鋼鐵公司籌備處，準備年內利用日本賠　設備，建立新廠，並就現有之機器設備及材料，先行裝配小規模鋼鐵設備，期於下半年開始生產，供應華中區域需要。此外，上海方面，　有上海　　公司，其煉鋼部份，自去年六月間開工，迄今已八月，聞前後生產共達一千噸云。本年度全國鋼鐵業預計產量爲鐵苗三十萬噸，生鐵四萬六千噸，鋼品一萬六千噸。產量實屬渺小，且因外匯桔竭，國外進口不易，故銷路方面，不成問題。原料亦以廢鋼棄鐵尚多，不虞匱乏，所感困難者唯燃料而已。</p>
<h3>財部訂五項辦法　防範滙疑作偽</h3>
<p>財政部爲防範各行莊辦理國內匯款，其匯款人收款人姓名住址或有假借虛列等情事，特規定辦法，通令邀行，辦法如下：</p>
<p>（一）各銀錢行莊承做國內匯款，無論係屬信匯票匯或電匯，均應洽由匯款人在匯款申請書中，塡具匯款人收款人之眞實姓名（或機關公司廠商之全名）及詳實住量、</p>
<p>（二）電匯之收款人，如以電報　號或解款行莊之往來帳號代替者，仍應洽由匯款人將收款人之原名及住址列明，以便登刋匯款帳。票匯之匯票，其匯款人請求開具空白抬頭匯票者，亦應洽由匯款人塡明收款人之姓名住址，以爲登帳之依據。</p>
<p>（三）凡屬由解款行莊留交之匯款，（包括留待收款人來取記解款行代收及旅行支票等性質之匯款）均應洽由匯款人塡明留交及收款人住址尚未確定原由，並應由承匯行將其原由一併列註帳册。</p>
<p>（四）各項匯款，除同業調撥，軍政機關公款撥匯，及土產公用交通等事業機構之款項劃款，應以機關或事業出應洽辦外，普通客戶匯款，每筆金額在二億元以上者，解付時應田收款人覓具股實保證，始准解付。倘未具保證，即行解付，經査明收款人姓名不實，住址不符者，由匯解行莊負其責任。</p>
<p>（五）銀錢行莊　反上列各條親定者，由財政部視其情節輕重依照加强金融業務管制辦法第十三條及第十四條之規定議處。</p>
<h3>自備外匯進口紙張　即將供應市需</h3>
<p>總數共達七千餘噸</p>
<p>自備外匯進口物資，當局處理已將完畢，就中有各項紙張，爲數頗巨，數達七千餘噸，什九均爲加拿大瑞典白報紙。速日已有紙商紛紛前往辦理承購手續，最短期內，即可供應市需。據紙商表示，邇來紙價回跌，即係上項刺激所致。預計供應增加後，紙價可能繼續猛跌云。</p>

<h3>對印度科學界的觀感</h3>
<p>— 楊實譯</p>
<p>印度和中國同是東方兩個古老的國家，過去都有着爍爛的文化供獻給世界。現在這兩個東方的獨立大國，都在吸收西方文明，從事科學的建設，印度因爲歷史的關係，比我們早一些，可是仍有着不少的缺點，他山之石，可以攻錯，印度科學界的情形或可供我們借鑒。本篇是美國布萊士里博士（Dr．Albet　F．Blackeslee）在印度觀光兩月後，發表的一篇最坦白，眞摯，指正印度科學界的文章。對　中國科學界，同樣具有警惕和指引的價値，特爲譯出，以稱讀者，譯者附識。</p>
<p>這是一篇我個人在一九四七年冬季（即一二兩月間）參加德里的印度科學會議後的報吿。與會的有各國科學家，美國方面有代表美國科學協進會（A．A．A．S．）的戴明博士（Dr．W．E．Deming），夏普禮博士（Dr．H．Shapley）和作者三人，此外加拿大三人，英國九人，蘇聯二人，法國一人，中國一人（陳省身博士）。除了參加德里的大會外，我們也參觀渦印度許多大城市中的大學和科學試驗室，就中如溫尼泊·拉荷爾·貝拿勒斯·加爾各答·馬德里斯·喀刺蚩·孟買諸城市，都先後到過。我不願意詳細寫這報吿，僅就個人匆忙參觀中所得的一點感想，吿訴給美國科學家們。</p>
<p>雖然我們只用了短短的三十四小時就田美國飛到印度，但他們的風俗習慣和宗敎却和我們離開的非常遙遠。在這片土地上有着許多驚人的差別存在，譬如氣候，民族，語言，宗敎及政府的形式。在我們看來，平民的貧苦和上層階級的享受和奢侈，有着絕大的懸殊。我們曾發現許多平民是在街道上或在德里最偉大的回敎堂的石級上睡覺，因爲他們窮的根本沒有其他地方可以住宿；但過後在新德里的總督府宴會席上那豪華奢侈令一個美國人吃驚。在許多富有的實業家的餐席上你可以飲到許多珍貴的名酒和香檳。事實上在大會中我們代表們所接觸的無論印度人和英國人都是學界人士和一些統治階層的人物，眞正貧苦的印度人很少機會能接觸到的。</p>
<p>這個科學會議中也分若干小組討論，一切很像美國科學協進會；會中討論之熱烈及批評之生動，使我們深深感到印度人在科學上已有長足的進展了。雖然印度有着幾百種不同的語言和方言，但整個會塲是英語控制了的，這對一些美國人一定要感到驚奇。印度北方的語言多從古阿利安語演變而來，而南方的達羅毘荼語却從另一個古語演化出來。於是英語便成了一般受良好敎育的印度人的通用語，除了兩個回敎大學外，所有的高等敎育機關都是用英語來講授的。從這裏也可以看出世界通用一種語言對科學的傳授上是有莫的裨益。雖然印度語是有一大部份的人可以說，但印度大學由不少，敎授在從事找出一種能使全印度報通行的國語來代替英語的地位；這也許是他們的民族意識的過分堅强因而想打斷一切和英國的關係。</p>
<p>印度人曾賦給我們許多新頴的試驗方法，但可惜這些都未能爲其他民族所重視。譬如一位卓越的女植物學家在討論到海藻的利用問題上，宣稱他們在這方面的努力，並不亞於美國，每一個農民都有一個魚池，投下某種化學物後就刺激海藻的生長，使魚很快的養大。這件事每一個美國科學家都聽到過，但迄今我們並沒有照他們那樣去做。印度人都相當在美國一切事都讓機械代替了人工，但他們不明白在美國人工是如何昂貴，而在印度人工却是最賤而工人是最多的地方。</p>
<p>印度的大學生和靑年科學工作者多希望能來美國留學，常常我們被包關着要求協助他們　進美國的大學。有的甚至冒失的在早餐之前就來拜訪我們，提出一些同樣的要求，一位才十五歲的學生，宣稱他希望能到美國來研究原子物理學。</p>
<p>在政治上印度人很關心美國的一切內外政策，尼赫魯在讀夏普禮博士和我參加他的夜宴上，（有兩位印度科學家作陪），曾表示極需要知道美國外交政策上的一些態度，特別是關於美蘇的關係上。他對於一九四六年共和黨在國會上的勝利，對這政策上所起的作用，更感到重大的關切。尼赫魯對其他國家有這樣熱烈的興趣和了解以及他爲了改善印度人民生活的偉大功績，是很使我們感動的。幾乎所有各階級的人都希望向美國學習，但他們不願意西方人把他們當作低等民族作施惠的對象，他們最痛恨在南非和印度的一些西方白人的「民族優越感一；爲了報復南非的歧視印度人，他們已經宣布抵制南非貨物入口，在孟買的一家飯店門口就貼着「南非人不准入內」的標語。</p>
<p>其實印度　英國人，也在依靠着美國，在一九四七年的一，二月間，英政府尙沒有決定退出印度的日期時，許多英國官員就已經着慌了，他們認爲很快印度人就會取他們而代之；有些英國人希望美國能在道義上援助印度，使她自己能站穩起來。</p>
<p>印度曾有使他們足以自豪的文化，它的古遠可以追溯到古阿利安時代，紀元前兩千年的吠陀經典，迄今仍有珍貴的文學價値。在我未到印度之前，和英國籍的官員談話，我認爲印度是一個智力低下的民族，但在我觀光以後，我完全改變了原來的看法，同時也看出英國人說印度民族低能，是別有用心的。印度學者們知道他們需要向西方學習科學和技術，不過這種學習是由於客觀環境的迫逼，而非主觀的自發性的，所以改變的相當怯。</p>
<p>在我和許多印度學者談話中我曾指出出在這世紀的前一二十年，美國必須向歐洲學習，特別向科學上居領導地位的德國學習，但不久以前，美國人已經明白這並不需要很長的時間。同樣的，今天印度是需要向西方學習，大量派遣留學生去接受科學的洗禮。不管英帝國以前在印度行使的殖民政策是否需要譴責和咒駡，他們對發展印度科學的功績，却是不可磨滅的，特別在　　上。我遇到的許多英國籍科學家確也一生的大部時間用來致力印度科學的進展，但當英國快退出印度時，有些人却不得不離開印度到旁的國家去謀職業了。我們總希望他們所致力的事業不會因此全部荒廢，而且在印度人自己致力下更能提高其水準。</p>
<p>英國人常說印度科學家在理論物理學上和數學上有極大的成功，雖然曾獲得諾貝爾物理學獎金的拉滿（Roman）實在是個卓越的實驗家，這話還是有部份眞理的。有些試驗工作，他們並不太好，但對某些試驗工作者熱烈的研究精神，却令人佩服。我發現印度科學家最大的缺點是不願意利用他們的雙手，這種缺點在其他國家裏的科學家們也常犯的。這種缺乏這對雙手操勞的神聖性的認識及森嚴的社會階級制度—現在已慢慢的在减少了—這對他們的科學和技術的進展有着極大的障礙。我曾遇到某省一個科學和工程方面的顧問，他吿訴我當他在美國一個理工大學留學時，他要比其他學生作更多的事，暑假中他去作苦工來賺學費，有時去給餐館做洗刷盆碟之類工作。但當他高興的把這些寫信吿訴他的父母時，他立即接到兩封海　電報喝令他趕快停止這樣作，因爲這樣要汚辱了他們高貴的門風。他又吿訴我他曾用每月一千二百　比（相當四百美金）去請一個工程師，但這人只願整大坐辦公桌子上，要他到工廠裏去眞正操作，他就不幹了·我在和他們談話中曾說過在家裏我也有時去帮助我的夫人洗滌盆碟，那是有價値的事，利用雙手去作實在是最好的功課，假　印度科學家來參觀美國時，他們便會從美國科學家中把這點可貴的精神學到。</p>
<p>一位美國駐在印度的副領事，吿訴我用一件事可以說明美國科學家和印度科學家的區別來。當一個美國人得到了哲學博士的學位時，那才正是他畢生事業的起點，但當一個印度人得到了哲學博士，就好像是他工作的終點，因為他感到已達到了他追求的目標了。一個印度學者一旦把大學的敎授位置握穩後，就停止了一切科學上的逍求，他們認爲一個人的地位遠較他從事的工作本身要重要的多。在大學裘那些眞正從事於最基本試驗和研究的人，是無法接近我們來討論他們的研究心得的，實事上，我發現他們是被迫遠離開我們的。在我的許多次講演中，我便提出互相交換心得是進步最需要的。</p>
<p>新近我接到一個印度學生寫來的一封信，事情是這樣，印度政府準備派遺若干名攻讀博士學位的研究生到美國史密斯學院生物研究所肄業，名單發表，他未被錄取，要求我去信給印度政府請他們重新考慮他們的決定；在信中他暗示這事對他的影響是很大而且很重要的。我們常常聽到他們抱怨因爲私人關係或者政治上原因，印度派出去的留學生多不是最優秀的學生云云，這種控訴是否眞的，抑或自己沒有被取後發出的恨憤之言，我們便無法去判斷了；但根本上我就沒有代他們寫過一封請求信。</p>
<p>我很願意成爲一個印度藩邦的酋王（Manaraja），這倒不是因爲他會有驚人的財富，數不淸的太太和高度　　的生活享受，而是由於他的權力和財力可以使印度科學和坡術有神速的進度，進　利用科學改善人民的生活水準。我們感到在印度，無論公共或者私人的關於公益事業的捐贈，非常需要提倡。很幸運的我們曾去參觀過幾個無論全部或一部是依靠私人捐助向科學機構；如加爾各的包斯植物研究所（Booe　Intitule　for　Plant　Resesrch）及孟買的達達醫院（Tata　Hospital　）在會議期中也參加過西里拉公爵工業學院的捐贈儀式，但這種事　機構是非常少。印度以大實業家本來就不比美國多，而富有向根本就沒有用金錢去捐助興辦科學和敎育事業的習慣。</p>
<p>許多顯貴　印度人都有英帝國給他們的封號，但是有一種很通行的看法，認爲這不過是用金錢去向大英皇室表示一點自己的忠誠而已。假使我是一個印度政府官員，我一定要取締這些封號和爵位，代之而起的是以印度爲主的稱呼。我建議採用「印度　主」（Inaian　Benefactor）這個封號封給那些一捐資給促進藝術，文學，科學和哲學事業的人；這和諾貝爾獎金一樣，不　　圍廣大一些。一個印度人假　在自己的名字後面加上「I．B」二字一定感到是極大的榮耀，（I．B．是Incian　Benefacor的首字母，不用B．I因爲這樣與「不列顚印度」（British　Incia）混淆不淸。）各字仍依印度習慣，那時我們聽到的是伊沙德捐主而再不是什麼約翰爵士（Sir　John）等英國名字了。用這種方法來鼓勵富人捐資以增進同胞的福利，總要比奉獻給大英皇室來得榮譽些罷！</p>
<p>我這樣坦白的批評印度科學界的許多缺點，其實美國學術界也不少是常犯的。在我旅行回國後感到我們的印度科學朋友是有着最高的熟誠和毅力，同時我堅信印度是一個具有偉大的潛在勢力的地方。他們的科學家們和大學生對我們的訪問和講演都非常重視，就我個人言，我從那裏學到的要比供獻他們的更多。像這種訪問不但有益　印美兩國的科學同志，且可增進國際間的互相了解。全世界只有一個科學，它不分國界，各國的科學家的互相觀摩，互相切磋，是最需要也是最有益的。</p>
<p>關於印度科學的狀况，我國文獻甚少，就譯者所知，本刋主編劉成敎授著有「印度科學」一書，由正中書局出版，對於印度科學發展的歷史，現在狀况，和科學機關，科學名家，分門別類，記述甚詳，可資參考。</p>
<h3>螺旋星雲及眾星</h3>
<p>—</p>
<h3>威爾遜天山天臺全景</h3>
<p>— 咸</p>
<h3>科學漫談　星空漫談</h3>
<p>— 潘承烈</p>
<p>在一個沒有月光的晴夜，抬起頭來看那滿佈羣星的蒼穹，這閃着光壯麗的奇觀，會使人悚然而恐，顯得人類是何等渺小。對星凝視的人大都爲這些羣星所啓示的機構和究竟發生疑問；更多人被它們天體的美感動了。</p>
<p>肉眼看得見的恒星似乎有百萬。實際上，因爲我們在一個時候只能見到天空的一半（還有一半在地球較遠的一面），所以不用光學儀器的幫助，我們至多只能看見三千五百顆星。</p>
<p>用一副好的雙眼望遠鏡，這數目便可增加到十二萬，威爾遜山上的一百吋大望遠鏡大約看得出十五億顆。還有更多數不盡的，遠得不是任何儀器能够探出。</p>
<p>許多年來，星一直是水手，牧羊人，和囑放駱駝者的引導及知友，於是希臘人，羅馬人，和阿拉俏人便替那些較爲顯著的星羣取了美麗的名字。北極星，購座的河鼓，牧夫座的大角是那機充滿着詩意在閃耀着。只要稍爲練習一下，並用一張星圖作爲帮助，這些以及其他數百個別的恒星便能用肉眼很容易的確定出它們在天上的位置，並且依它們顏色和大小辨認出來。</p>
<p>埃及天文學家拓理末恒星的光度分爲六等，肉眼可看到的最暗弱的星是第六等；亮二倍半的爲第五等，以此類推，直到那耀目的一等星如天狼，大角，參右足，和南河大星等。</p>
<p>星有着各種顏色的分度，我們能辨出紅色的參左　，黃色的迷拉，淺藍色的織女，星顏色的變化是因爲它們溫度變化。好像一根　棒加　後起初暗紅色，溫度漸高變黃，再變白熱。所以一顆暗紅星，如畢宿大星，是熱得最少，表面大約華氏六千度。黃色星，如天庫，就要熱二倍。天空最熱的星是藍白色的，室女座中的藍白星角宿一表面溫度達三萬六千度。</p>
<p>天文學家用抵抗微熱器（Bolomcter）來量得星的溫度，那是一種電表，把一然色白金條暴露在星的輻射熱下，用最精細的準確度來紀錄它們表面熱　。另一種星的溫度表呌熱電池，是放在望遠鏡主焦點上的一組無綫電真空管。</p>
<p>當我們看星時，它們大都好像一樣大小，不過這變化卻是很大的。有的可用一種呌呌Interfcrometer的器儀來址。一九二〇年梅格孫敎授利川光的繞射作用及複雜的數學算出參左肩的直徑是二億七千萬哩—一個比我們地球直徑大三萬倍的怪物。然而參左肩和巨大的武仙座Alpha星比起來却又顯得像侏儒，因爲後者大得那樣出奇，如果它在我們太陽的位置它將吞沒有地球並且伸展火星軌道以外！</p>
<p>天空旣有無數這類巨星，有人會懷疑空中也許太擠了吧？但如某天文學家所說：「在歐洲上空放仨個黃蜂，那麼黃蜂在歐洲空中要比恒星在空間更爲擁擠。」</p>
<p>星球間的空間廣闊得不可想像，太陽（我們太陽系中心的恒星）只離地球九千三百萬哩，而太陽系最外圈的行星冥王星，離太陽有四十億哩之多。再外面便是很大的空隙—一個空間的深淵，使我們的太陽系在宇宙裏實際上孤立着—直到二十五萬億哩外才出現了第一顆最近我們的恒星馬身人Alpha，天狼星卻還要再遠一倍。太陽光在八分鐘內達到我們，但天狼星的光到達我們要八年以上。</p>
<p>這些閃爍着一點點的光只是構成宇宙圖畫的前景吧了，在更遠的地方，我們看到一條淡淡如珠光的帶子跨越在空中好像撒了粉的半圓，這就是銀河，爲一千億顆　組合的光所構成，遙遠得看出來分不開，再加上極大量星的塵，那是在胚胎期中的物質，也就是說，尙未出生的恒星。</p>
<p>琴斯爵士（Sir　James　Jeans）描述銀河像一個大馬車輪的輪緣　着中心輪軗旋轉，輪心離地球五萬光年，我們的太陽是這系較小恒星中的一個，在這銀河系裏（宇宙內至少還有一億個同樣的銀河系）我們所引以自　的地球比起來只不過像飄浮在太平洋上的一小點花粉而已。</p>
<p>但可量得的距離遠在銀河以外，成爾遜山（Mont　Wilson）的大望遠鏡帮天文學家獲得了球狀星團的光，那是一簇蜂羣似的恒星還得光要化一萬八千年至十八萬四千年才能到達地球，例如武仙座M十三號球狀星團大約在石器時代的人類出現在地球上時所發出的光，要到今天才進入天文學家眼中。</p>
<p>假如這些球星團的遙遠引起了你幻想，那麼所謂「島狀宇宙」（＂Isand　Universe＂）的更大距離會使這幻想變得麻木，在遙遠的空間深處，這些「星雲」正以可驚的速度衝向宇宙邊緣，哈佛大學敎授夏布萊（H·Shapley）證明M八十七號星雲的光要八百萬年才能達到我們，但你別忘了光在一秒鐘就可進行十八萬六千哩啊！</p>
<p>新完成的美國加州巴洛馬山（Mont　Paroma）頂的二百吋大望遠鏡，並不如一般所說的能在各方面有新的發現，譬如用這大望遠鏡來觀月亮便是浪費，因爲研究月亮最有效的例是大小適　約六吋至二十吋的望遠鏡，這　新望遠銳主要的功用是收集宇宙裏遠得不相信的部份所來的光，使我們對於一兆光年外的空間增加不少知識。</p>
<p>宇宙是不是封閉的，有一定大小，和限定界限的呢？（這種說法是根據愛因斯坦（Einstein）說，即空間　曲到原處，有點像地　表面的曲度，）還是像愛丁頓（Eccington）所相信，這是個膨脹着的宇宙，裏面充滿了子萬個像我們　種銀河系，各自繼續不斷在難以置信的速度下奔向無邊的空間呢？目前的恒星還是在極度混亂爆裂的情况下，原子連　反應變原來的物質爲熱，光，和電磁彼，像我們的太陽（一顆小小的恒星）每一秒鐘要把四百二十萬噸的物質變爲能量，就是這種物質和能量的可能轉換性——一九〇五年愛因斯坦用理論的公式所發表——給與我們物理學家第一次確定的棧索知通地面上的原子所隱藏着可怕和無限的能力。</p>
<p>一顆恒星只不過是一大堆永久爆裂着的原子，在中心可怕的熱量襲擊下，氣體原子全部碎裂了，電子和核子的碎片混亂地衝撞，但恒星中心部的內壓力卻那樣可怕使碎裂的原十搗壓在一起形成密度大得無比的物質——大得一立方吋的這種物質會有好幾噸重。（比了這些重原子，我們這似乎很堅實的地球只是蒲公英軟毛所組成的了，）核子物理學家分裂鈾原子吋，僅把恒星中一直發生的能量創造程序取用了極小一些·</p>
<p>事實上今日的天文觀察全是用照相術：即使用最大透鏡都不能看到的暗弱恒星可以在暴露了幾小時（或幾天）的照相感光板上記錄出來，最銳利的觀察者所不能察出的變化可用望遠鏡照相機認明，羅威爾（Lowel　l）敎投　着困難的數學算出我們太陽系最外圈一定有冥工星存在着，但化了十五年功夫及無數張照相才在空中找到了這位遊蕩者的位置。</p>
<p>着人類的智慧，宇宙的神秘漸漸在我們面前揭露了，科學的進步，擴大了我們的宇宙觀，在這廣漠無比的空間，地球　　　地位，實在比淪海的一粟還小得多。</p>
<p>自由談</p>
<h3>談文化氮氛</h3>
<p>— 吳庸</p>
<p>筆者愛好讀書。不過這只是爲讀書而讀書，並無什麼目的，蓋志不在學以致用，並且也不相信讀書會有什麼不可思議的功用·筆者的讀書只是一種癖好，好比吸烟，吸烟固然沒有益處，可是不吸總覺有點心神不寗，坐立不定；書之與我，正也是這種情形。</p>
<p>只因幾年來時局動盪不安，物價高漲，一般人的生活成了問題，筆者自然也不能例外·於生活栗六之中那裏還能安享讀書的癖好。大槪是所謂「物以類聚」吧，間或也有倡然的機會與幾位有同嗜的友人聚會，不免談談古今的書藉，講講最近的出版物，看看書架上讀渦的五光十彩的圖書。於這樣的空氣中，久已减退了的讀書的興趣又油然而生，覺得閱讀中外古今文藉，確實是一種淸福，是人生一大樂事。</p>
<p>我們要引起人們對讀書的興趣，第一自然須看此人是否是讀書種子；因爲人各有其個性，倒底不易予以變更，沒有讀書性情的人，任憑你用種種方法去引他，我看總歸徒然。第二，縱令是讀書種子，若是沒有讀書的環境，沒有與士人接觸的機會，也將减少對於書藉的興趣，甚至根本不會對書藉發生好感。</p>
<p>是故讀書最須注重讀書的氣氛。養成了一般人讀書的習慣，造成了社會上濃厚的讀書氣氛，是否有益，固然難說，可是倒底也不會有消極的破壞作用。而事實上今人對於這點並不注意，很少致力。對於破壞事業却是用足了全力。但思文明如美國，人民進大學念讀，以繳費爲原則，大學敎育還沒有被定爲國家的義務敎育；而於軍事敎育方面如西點者，學生自入學至畢業，學費固然免繳，而於衣食住等項也是不取分文，可謂優待萬分。足見美國政府也是重武不重文。</p>
<p>史配林·好華德於「我的兒，我的兒」一書中有一句話，筆者認爲不失爲至理名言。他說：「人們的聯合是靠恨，不是靠愛·」此語乃是作者觀察世界古今事實的結晶。有不少人一聽得軍號，便會振臂奮起，投筆從戎。一個第三四流的演說者如果作煽動性的演講，定會使聽者痛哭流淚，或會使聽者鼓掌呌好。一個第一流的學者作學術性的演講，雖也會有人去聆聽，可是其目的恐怕爲學術者少，爲滿足其好奇心者多。又如耶穌畢生宣傳愛的哲學，其門徒也不過十餘人，而與他反對的人們却是成羣結隊；結果耶穌寡不敵衆，終於被恨的集團殺死了。</p>
<p>人們容易爲了「恨」而結合，這眞是人類的一大悲劇。只是筆者認爲這未必一定是出於人的天性，或許與後天的敎育不無關係。自古迄今，人們致力於破壞者多，將來終會有一天把目光自「恨」轉移到「愛」的上面去。只是要達到這個目的，仍有賴於人們的重視敎育，宣揚文化。</p>
<p>要宣揚文化，必須先形成一種「文化氣氛」。約翰遜行述裏有一段關於當時士人集會聚談的描寫，那個集團的文化氣氛之濃厚，眞是令人心榴往之。茲節譯之如下：「約翰遜喜歡擱起了脚把心中的話傾吐出來。可是　　位健談的友人聚在一種時，他的談話尤爲精彩。於一七六四年時，這幾位友人組織了一個會社，這個會社後來在文學界中漸漸的成了一很大的勢力。這個學會對於新書的評語會立即傳　於整個的倫敦，會使一版書立即銷完，也會使新出版　被棄而供諸製箱者及製餅者之用。這點實　足怪，因爲參加這個學會的都是第一流的轉學鴻儒。如高爾德史密斯是詩學與輕鬆文學的代表；雷諾是藝　的代表；勃克是政治哲學的代表；此外還有史學家吉龐，語言學大家襲斯。名伶茄立克與會時總帶來說不盡的笑話。班納·蘭登是希臘文學權威；托風·皮克拉以行爲風流著稱，言語機智，對於風月塲中的知識　爲　富。在這樣的集團中，要想領導羣倫，很不容易，而的輸遜却是這個集團的領袖。」</p>
<p>我國的學者才人眞也需要這麼的一個會社。這個會社一方面可以作爲士人的俱樂部，另一方面自然還可以收「集思廣益」的實　。</p>
<h3>西寺的「房」荒</h3>
<p>— 無咎</p>
<p>倫敦的西寺不但是皇室舉行大典的地方，它也還是英國的名流埋骨之所。但西寺的地皮有限，而歷代之名流無窮，於是也鬧着人滿之患。西寺當局早在一九〇七年就規定，以後下葬者每屍以骨灰一瓶爲限，省得多佔地方，然而時至今日，即使這樣辦了也還是容納不下那麼多的名流·當局焦急之餘，就把全寺所葬的「名流」名册檢視一番，準備必要時請小名流遷葬，讓大名流遞補—不想檢視的結果却頗有出人意外者，原來西寺莊嚴神聖之地，在許多豪門巨閥文人學士之中，竟也長眠着沒沒無聞的門房一人，洗衣婦一人，鉛皮匠一人，騙子一人！</p>
<h3>背字典</h3>
<p>— 念鴻</p>
<p>有一極普通的成語，這行很廣，就是：「只要工夫深，鐵杵磨成針。」它說明了持恒必成的眞理。</p>
<p>然而任何金科玉律，都要能够活用，否則即是聖經，也有被魔鬼引用的危險，如果拘泥字面，便容易鬧出笑話。記得幼時初中裏一個敎英語的先生，是個自學成功的用功苦學生，沒有進渦大學，對於英語倒頗有研究，直到如今，我對他的品格和努力，仍極欽佩。但對當時讀書時候他的敎授法，却實在不敢恭維。原來他敎學生課餘背字典，一本英漢字典，三四萬個字，據他說起來，每天記廿個，能够持之以恒，不間斷不玩忽，五六年後，便全在胸中了，而他自已就是這樣苦幹過來的，至今仍朗朗上口，大半記得。那時候學生中也有照他的話去試的，我便是其中一個，但是沒有半個月，便中道而廢，其他同學，也沒有一個不和我同樣情形的。</p>
<p>現在想起來，委實覺得可笑，自己因爲乏人指導，所以去採用這種笨法子，原也未可厚非，但敎學生都如此做，便迂得可笑。有恒而能成功，當然無可懷疑，但眞的要開一所製針廠而都用一枝枝的鐵杵來磨的話，便是大呆瓜。鐵杵固能磨成針，但如果將鐵杵分成小塊而再磨的話，豈非事半功倍了麼？</p>
<p>因爲做事喜歡貪便捷，所以一切科學方法才會發明。化最少的代價，獲最大的成果，這才是合乎經濟的原則，無論什麼情形是這樣·無謂的犧牲，是最不是爲訓的。</p>
<p>譬如以戰爲例吧，單槍匹馬或者孤軍敢死隊之類，縱然能够在敵陣中衝殺一陣，憑着勇氣能耐，東衝西撞，但結果還是不合算，不是「壯烈身殉」，便是「全軍覆沒」，二十世紀中決沒有奇蹟出現。尤其是現代戰爭，早從拳頭誰大臂脾誰粗進爲腦與腦的智力爭鬥，運籌帷幄，決勝千里，單純原始的戰圖方式，久已被淘汰掉，雖然我們不該陷於「唯武器論」的窠臼，但對一切的估計，也不能只憑機動的。</p>
<p>「血的應用正如金錢一般，吝嗇雖然是不行的，浪費也大大的失算。一我們固不能太珍視自己，但過份自已看輕自己，讓光陰儘情的虛擲在瑣事雜務上，讓生命無辜地消耗在平凡碎細上，又可嘗値得？一股傻勁當然不可或缺，但方法也要懂得運用，减少不必要的損失光陰，便是延長了自已的壽命與能力。</p>
<p>但是侈言方法而不求實際可更不行了。說理論，口若懸河；要動手，寸步難行。那末與其高談戰略形勢，還不若縛了炸藥衝上去，多少炸死幾個敵人；與其無所事事何不背背字典，對於英文究竟有些帮助的。</p>
<h3>兩門新的學科</h3>
<p>— 起鳳</p>
<p>爲了要求得高深的學識和研究的機會才使我們進大學，這是誰也不曾否認的；可是求知固然是入大學的一個最大的提，然　靑年在生活和修養上所需要　指示和討論，却也佔有同樣為要的地位，可惜這重要性被各大學所忽略了。</p>
<p>滬江大學的敎域員日前討論靑　問題，經辯論後，投票的結果是多歡　敎授贊成在原有純學術研究的課程由應添設「求婚」與「結婚」二科。這一個大胆革新而富有現實性的決議，我認爲是値得重視的。（事見廿五日本報）</p>
<p>許多學識豐富，總明智　的靑年，因戀愛的創痛和婚姻的失敗而造成瘋頓。自殺。出奔等等的悲劇，他們在學識和事業上的成就也都隨之而去。這種可怕的損失，就是因爲對於戀愛和婚姻問題缺乏眞正的理解和認識。事實上我們每人都要經過戀愛和結婚的階段，那麼爲什麼校方不把這含有如此重要性的科目成立起來，使一般的靑年們在良好教授的指導和啓　之下，去求得一個正確的認識呢？</p>
<p>在美國，由於大學靑年的需要，對於與女性的問題的討論早已成爲正式的學科，延請知名的心理學家·醫師·及研究靑年問題的專家來帮助他們解決疑難，爲什麼我們中國的靑年，在同樣的需要之下，就連戀愛和婚姻問題都不能得到一個正確的解答和誘導呢？</p>
<p>「求婚」和「結婚」是兩個切要的學科，假如　爲校方和同學重視，好好地發揮它們的功能的話，對於今日所謂戀愛或家庭的悲劇，一定能减少許多，這於社會而言，也未始不是一個進步的現象。</p>
<p>這是一個新的，現實　　　，希望能得到各方的擁護！</p>

<p>渚齋聽了這句話，不由打一個冷戰，想不到她竟怨恨到這地步，心裏所預備說的話，也說不出口了，答應一聲「好吧！」低頭喪氣，走出家門，鳳笙送他出了這門口，把門評的一聲關‘上了·渚齋回過頭來，對門口看一看，不由暗自傷心，此時好似喪家之狗，給主人打了一鞭，趕了出去。踽踽走出胡同口，　一輛三輪軍，惘然回到宿舍。一人躺在床上，把前後事情一想，覺得雲鄉和鳳笙二人舉動元全不同，一人有一人的作風，看她們情形，對於自己，都不能諒解，這事應該怎麼辦呢？原想鳳笙是一個爽直痛快的人，在她面前，求饒幾句，她一定會答應的，不想她恨我如此之深，竟說我已經死了，對我毫無一點留戀。由今晚上的情形看來，要想和她重歸於好，是不可能的，看她今晚對我的表示，可以說是完全失望了。只有　卿她雖然怨我，只蘊蓄在心頭，在她言外，仍是餘情未斷，我明天還是上　家裏去，跟她坦白的表示一番，如能得她諒解，我們最初的希望。還可以達到，從前認爲種種難關，現在給鳳笙如此一番表示，便容易解決了。渚齋這一夜，胡思亂想一陣，也沒有好睡。第二天，也懶得上班，才有九點多鐘，便趕到雲卿家裏去。據伺候雲卿的李媽說：「大小姐病了，沒有起床。」渚齋一直走到樓上　卿的臥房裏，只雲卿躺在床上，一張黃臘臘的臉，精神十分憔悴。渚齋不待招呼，便挨在她床沿坐下，問道：「怎麼不舒服？吃了藥了沒有？」雲鄕一語不答，眼角通出眼淚，把身子一轉，臉朝床裏去。渚齋用手在她被單上，輕輕的拍一拍道：「怎麼？你有什麼難渦？」雲鄕帶着哭聲答道：「我呌你別來，你怎麼又來了？我不要見你！「渚齋道：「我除你之外，沒有別的地方可走，我昨夜一晚沒睡，想了一夜，只有來這裏和你談談。」雲卿道：「我呌你回家去，你爲什麼不回去？「渚齋道：「我昨晚上已經回去了，鳳笙把我趕出來，她說我已經死了，不願再和我說話，我那能再回去？　雲鄕一聽這話，很感　異，把臉轉出來，向着渚齋問道：「怎麼把你趕出來？你回去怎麼對她說的？「渚齋就把從進門，以及被趕出來情形，細　一遍。　鄕道：「這是你的魯莽啊，怪不得鳳笙！」</p>

<h3>半內幕新聞</h3>
<p>— 調鸚</p>
<p>世人似乎都有歡探人隱私的偏愛，所以無論中外的報章刋物，祗要多多揭載內幕新聞或政治秘辛之類，總能得到讀者歡迎。前些時上海有些報紙也爭以刋載內幕新聞爲尙，而實在這些內幕也者大多已是公開的秘密，有些　直連「秘密」二字也够不上，不過是記者先生把早已零零碎碎發表過的新聞整理了一下，使讀者們容易摸淸來龍去脈，彷　印象一新罷了。</p>
<p>但在目前的美國新聞界却流行着一種新的寫法，他們以入情入理之筆，以簡潔緊俏的文字，儘量報導着謠言，猜測，幻想——有時也有一些眞的內幕新聞。這類東西多半由一些紅極一時的「專欄撰述家」和「電台評論家」天天大量傾銷出來，我因爲其「新聞」的可靠性頗有問題，「內幕」也不一定名符其實，姑稱之爲「半內幕新聞」。</p>
<p>即使如此，「半內幕新聞」的讀者是廣大的，影響是深遠的。因爲，它們的趣味性相當濃厚，相當可以滿足人們窺探隱私的欲望。最近柯里安雜誌上恢復了「華盛頓政訊」一欄，登載的東西就可說是標準的「半內幕新聞」。新聞本身的價値固有問題，但這一種表現的形式却還是値得我們注意的；若以作爲採訪新聞的綫索，更是一等材料，今擇尤譯　　則如下。</p>
<p>（一）美國大選前夕，參院議長范登堡已與總統候選人紐約州長杜威取得默契，密切合作。他們合作的基礎有二：一是二人都極力反對候選人共和黨參議員塔虎脫；一是二人都極贊成共和黨的外交顧問杜勒斯（杜勒斯與杜威的關係尤深）。據熟悉內幕情形人士稱，　城舉行共和黨大會時，范登堡將全力支持杜威，使杜咸能得到共和黨提名爲總統候選人，萬一仍遭失敗，則范登堡將參加競選，杜威將全力予以支持。</p>
<p>（二）杜魯門的全國普遍軍訓法案勢　通過之望，杜魯門雖一再强調普遍軍訓的甫要性，但議員大多不加理睬。</p>
<p>（三）四　間法國大選的結果雖尙在未定之天，但戴高樂已在美國積極活動，華府的法國大使館中，就有許多都是戴高樂的親信，他們不但爲戴氏作巧妙的宣傳，而且美國任何風吹草動，都立刻報吿戴氏知道。許曼政府明知有此情形，而無法加以制止。（譯者按：許曼總理近曾公開抨擎戴高樂的政策爲不合法國國情　。）</p>
<p>（四）美駐英大使道格拉斯被任爲馬歇爾計劃執行總監的呼聲甚高，現已有多人逐鹿駐英大使一缺，尤以現任駐澳大使勃脫勒（原係大銀行家），駐波大使葛列菲士（　爾街巨子）等二人最表關切。</p>
<p>（五）阿根廷的獨裁總統貝隆前曾宣稱願以五十億美元貸與南美各國，全係次牛。事實上阿根廷的金準備及美元準備都極感恐慌，英國前曾把在阿根廷建造的鐵路賣給貝隆，而視在向他收賬竟極感困難。貝隆祗有一點剩餘的穀類，想待善價而沽罷了。</p>

<h3>The Number of Registered Representatives Meets the Legal Quorum; The National Assembly Opens This Morning; The Session is Set for 22 Days; The First Preparatory Meeting Will Be Held Tomorrow; The President Can Be Elected on April 12th</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 28th] The first National Assembly is scheduled to open as planned on the morning of the 29th under the chairmanship of Chairman Chiang. The democratic politics of the Republic of China will enter a new stage from the 29th. The session is scheduled for 22 days, and the main theme of the assembly is the election of the President and Vice President. According to the scheduled agenda, the President is expected to be elected on April 12th, the Vice President on April 17th, and the closing ceremony will be held on the 19th. It is also heard that the inauguration date of the President has been set for May 5th. The opening ceremony is scheduled to be held at the National Assembly Hall at 11:00 AM on the 29th.

The opening ceremony will be held at the National Assembly Hall on Linsen Road, Nanjing, at 11:00 AM on the morning of that day." At the same time, it is stipulated that representatives will respectfully pay homage to the Mausoleum of Dr. Sun Yat-sen at 9:00 AM on that day. This day is also the national Spring Commemoration Day for revolutionary martyrs and fallen soldiers. It has also been decided to go to the Martyrs' Cemetery at Guling Temple at 10:00 AM to pay public tribute to the revolutionary martyrs and fallen soldiers, then return to hold the opening ceremony. The procedure will be: (1) Ceremony begins, (2) All stand at attention, (3) Chairman takes his seat, (4) Play music, (5) Sing the national anthem, (6) Bow three times to the national flag and the portrait of Dr. Sun Yat-sen, (7) Chairman delivers the opening address, (8) Representatives take the oath, (9) Play music, (10) Ceremony concludes. Rest in the afternoon. The first preparatory meeting will be held at 9:00 AM on the 30th. In addition, the preparatory work for the assembly has been completed. The reporter inspected the assembly hall on the evening of the 28th. Due to the addition of seats and the construction of side seats, the venue is now more spacious than the Constitutional National Assembly. The arrangement is as solemn as the Constitutional National Assembly, and the illumination of the fluorescent lights on the four walls is even more brilliant than last time. (Other news about the National Assembly will be published on page 2)</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 28th] The registration of National Assembly representatives was most crowded on the 28th. The staff was extremely busy. As of 12:30 AM, 661 people had registered, bringing the total to 1,694, which is more than half of the total number of representatives. Those who registered on the 28th included Wu Jingheng, Cheng Qian, Yu Bin, Zhang Qun, Bai Chongxi, Pan Gongzhan, Qian Xinzhi, Wang Xiaolai, Mo Dehui, etc. Chairman Chiang called the chief secretary of the Assembly Preparatory Office, Hong Lan You, from his official residence at about 10:00 PM on the 28th to inquire about the registration situation. Hong immediately replied that the number of registered representatives had exceeded half, meeting the legal quorum, and the opening ceremony of the first National Assembly on the morning of the 29th would be held as scheduled.</p>
<p>The Problem of the Representatives from the Democratic Socialist and Youth Parties is Resolved; The Youth Party Declares its Decision to Participate in the Assembly</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 28th] The problem of the representatives from the Democratic Socialist and Youth Parties was resolved on the 28th. They collectively went to register at about 10:00 PM on the 28th. Chairman Chiang summoned key members of the two parties, Xu Chuanbi, Yang Qiqiao, Jiang Yuntian, Yu Jiaju, Liu Dongyan, etc., on the morning of the 28th to inform them again of the decision to yield to friendly parties. The Chairman stated: The validity of signatures for nomination and election refers to within the party. For friendly parties, a decision has been made to yield. Later, at 5:00 PM, they convened a meeting at Sun Ke's residence with members of the Democratic Socialist and Youth Parties, such as Xu and Yu, to discuss details. It lasted until 9:00 PM. It is heard that the Democratic Socialist Party can obtain about 200 seats, and the Youth Party slightly more.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 28th] The spokesperson of the Chinese Youth Party issued the following statement on the 28th regarding participation in the first National Assembly: The Chinese Youth Party has been striving for democratic constitutionalism for more than 20 years. It completed the great task of constitutionalism based on its long-held aspirations. Subsequently, to prepare for the implementation of constitutionalism, it participated in the government. Now, on the eve of the convening of the National Assembly, to assist in the implementation of constitutionalism, realize democracy, and complete the great task of national construction, the participation of our party in the National Assembly is only natural. As for the supplementary regulations on party nominations by the State Council and the agreements between parties that our party has insisted on, Chairman Chiang has solemnly announced their implementation. Therefore, our party has resolutely decided to participate in the National Assembly to assist in this grand event.</p>
<p>[United Press, Nanjing, 28th] After Chairman Chiang issued a sternly worded statement, the spokesperson of the Democratic Socialist Party stated on the 28th that the party considered Chairman Chiang's decision "very reasonable and excellent" and expressed complete satisfaction with it.</p>
<h3>The Problem of the Representatives from the Democratic Socialist and Youth Parties is Resolved; The Youth Party Declares its Decision to Participate in the Assembly</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 28th] On the eve of the convocation of the National Assembly, the National Political Council, which has participated in politics for ten years, officially announced its dissolution on the 28th in accordance with the law. Reviewing the glorious history of the past ten years, the councilors celebrated the completion of their great responsibility, and at the same time, were reluctant to part after ten years of gathering. They solemnly held a closing tea party and invited Chairman Chiang to attend and give instructions. The past councilors, especially those who believed that although the Council had ended, their own responsibility to the country had not disappeared, formed a Liaison Association of Past Councilors to continue to strive for the completion of democratic politics with ten years of experience. The Liaison Association was officially established on the morning of the 28th, issued a declaration, and elected Mo Dehui and 50 others as directors, and Hu Shi and 30 others as supervisors.</p>
<p>The closing tea party was held on the afternoon of the 28th. More than a hundred past councilors attended. Government officials who participated included Sun Ke, Yu Youren, Zhang Qun, Wang Yunwu, Bao Erhan, Wang Shijie, Yu Hongjun, Zhu Jiahao, Xu Shiying, Xue Dubi, Hang Liwu, Xu Baiyuan, Xie Guansheng, and Li Weiguo. Zhang Boling, Mo Dehui, Wu Yifang, Jiang Yong, and others from the Presidium of the Political Council also attended. Chairman Chiang arrived at the venue at 3:55 PM, dressed in military uniform, looking radiant.</p>
<p>Zhang Boling, in his capacity as interim chairman, delivered a speech, first comparing the work of the Council over the past ten years to "pulling a boat". The work of pulling a boat requires everyone to unite and concentrate their strength in order to reach the destination smoothly. Fortunately, the ten years of work of the Council have enabled it to steer this boat to its destination fairly and squarely, without encountering the danger of reefs. Recalling that at the tea party at Chairman Chiang's official residence at the beginning of its establishment ten years ago, he delivered a speech with "knowing the difficulty and knowing the danger" as encouragement, which is still applicable today.</p>
<p>Mo Dehui, in his closing speech, cited three things to show the prestige of the Political Council: (1) Supporting the War of Resistance and National Construction, (2) Assisting the Government in Construction, (3) Promoting Democratic Constitutionalism. At the end, he declared: Supporting Chairman Chiang as the first President of the Republic, which was unanimously and enthusiastically applauded. Chairman Chiang was then invited to deliver instructions. The Chairman looked radiant and smiled as he spoke (the original speech is below). The whole venue expressed their support with applause.</p>
<p>In his reply speech, Zhang Boling expressed that he would invigorate his spirit and work hard, and the future would surely be bright.</p>
<p>Finally, Councilor Su Ting specially raised the importance of local self-defense forces, hoping that the central government could allocate 100,000 guns to form ten self-defense regiments. In addition, some people also suggested that the suppression of the Communists should be coordinated with military affairs politically, implement the Principle of People's Livelihood, and reform the land system. The meeting concluded satisfactorily at 5:00 PM.</p>
<h3>Minister Bai Returns to Nanjing</h3>
<p>Optimistic About the Battle Situation in the Dabie Mountains</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 28th] Minister of National Defense Bai Chongxi, who flew to Wuhan to inspect the situation a few days ago, flew back to the capital after completing his official business on the afternoon of the 28th. The reporter specially visited him to inquire about the battle situation in the Dabie Mountain area. He stated: The bandit area in the Dabie Mountains has now entered the stage of clearing out scattered bandits. The main force of the Communist bandits has been completely defeated. The Communist bandits have lost face-to-face control of various counties, townships, and towns. The National Army is developing political organizations under military cover. Therefore, the baojia system in various counties, townships, and towns has now been established. The Communist bandits have no source of food, cannot conscript young men, and are finding it more difficult to gather intelligence. It is estimated that since the establishment of the Jiujiang Forward Command on October 27th of last year, a period of four months, the various tasks originally planned have been largely completed. Currently, if the military and political sectors can fully cooperate, there should be no problem in suppressing bandits in the Dabie Mountain area. Bai's conversation was full of confidence, showing optimism about the battle situation.</p>
<h3>Full Text of Chairman Chiang's Instructions: The Government Must Be Responsible for Eliminating the Bandit Disaster, With Firm Confidence to Overcome Difficulties</h3>
<p>The full text of Chairman Chiang's address at the closing tea party of the National Political Council is as follows:</p>
<p>The National Political Council has been established for ten years. During these ten years, all colleagues have united and assisted the government to complete the mission of the War of Resistance, which is an immortal contribution of this council to the nation, and one that I will always remember. Now, on the occasion of the end of this council, I personally recall that the government made a decision ten years ago that I still regret, that is, the error in judgment regarding the Communist Party. The government at that time believed that the Communist Party, in the face of national righteousness, would abandon its conspiracy to overthrow the government and undermine unity, and would work together with compatriots across the country to strive for the great cause of the War of Resistance and national construction. Therefore, it allowed them to participate in this council. Unexpectedly, this erroneous decision led to today's evil consequences. Now, the Communist bandits have openly rebelled, making it impossible to recover national territory, and the suffering of the people is deepening day by day. This is the responsibility that the government should bear. However, the government must be responsible to the end, thoroughly eliminate the bandit disaster, save the people, recover the lost land, and ensure the unity and independence of our country.</p>
<p>Now, some people believe that the current situation of the country is more serious than the initial stage of the War of Resistance. This is actually a superficial view. When we observe the safety and danger of the country and nation, we must see the greater picture and look far ahead.</p>
<h3>Chairman Chiang's Letter to the Youth of the Nation: Encouraging Them to Recognize the National Crisis and Their Own Responsibilities, To Eradicate Obstacles to the Revolution, and To Lay the Foundation for the Nation</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 28th] The 29th is the anniversary of the Huanghuagang Uprising, also the 5th Youth Day. Chairman Chiang specially wrote a letter to the youth of the nation, the full text of which is as follows:</p>
<p>Today is the anniversary of the martyrdom of the seventy-two martyrs of Huanghuagang, and also our fifth Youth Day. It is also the beginning of our democratic constitutionalism. This triple festival has its great significance. Our youth of the nation must commemorate the deeds of the martyrs, inherit the cause of the martyrs, so as not to be unworthy of being outstanding youth who carry on the past and open up the future for our Chinese nation.</p>
<p>The purpose of our national revolution for fifty years has been to save the country from peril, and to establish our Republic of China as an independent, free, unified and democratic new country. The Battle of Huanghuagang manifested the sacrificial spirit of revolutionary youth who devoted themselves to the country with the utmost integrity and awakened the national consciousness of the general society at that time which was on the verge of extinction. The success of the Xinhai Revolution, the completion of the Northern Expedition, and the achievements of the youth joining the army movement during the War of Resistance all inherited this glorious tradition. Now, it has been more than two years since we won the War of Resistance. At the beginning of the victory, due to the Communist Party's obstruction of the surrender and demobilization, and its insistence on armed separatism and undermining national unity, our China lost the golden opportunity for post-war national construction. In order to seek peaceful construction, the government did not hesitate to make repeated concessions, while the Communist bandits used the opportunity of negotiations and mediation to expand their occupied territories and rebel forces. Finally, they revealed their disguised masks, implemented a full-scale rebellion, and did not hesitate to destroy the country, ruin the nation, damage the social economy, and endanger the people's livelihood. Wherever the Communist bandits roamed, production and transportation were completely destroyed, and food and materials were plundered. The people in the bandit areas suffered inhuman trampling and slaughter. The compatriots in the rear also suffered the bitterness of poverty and cold. Our nation has reached a critical period of life and death. In order to preserve the glory of independence and freedom sacrificed by our revolutionary martyrs and the army and people during the War of Resistance, we must inherit their cause and fight to the death to complete the great task of saving the country. Youth is the rising life of the country. First of all, I want to awaken the youth of the nation to recognize the national crisis, recognize their own responsibilities, rise up in time to eradicate the greatest obstacles to our revolution and national construction, lay the foundation for our country's independence and freedom, and guarantee the realization of our democratic constitutionalism and the Three Principles of the People.</p>
<p>The youth of the nation must know that our eight-year War of Resistance in the past was to ensure the independent survival of the country, restore the integrity of territorial sovereignty, and seek the completion of economic construction and democratic constitutionalism. But all these prerequisites are based on national unity. Any national independence movement or national renaissance movement in the world must also be a national unification movement. Only when the country is unified can the nation ensure its independence. Take the United States as an example. The American founding movement began with the War of Independence in 1775, but the foundation of the American state was laid more than seventy years later, when President Lincoln defeated the Southern secession movement in the Civil War, and then the long-term peace and stability of the country was ensured. From this, we can see that the work of national construction cannot be accomplished overnight, and the cause of unification must go through a long struggle to quell the rebellion before it can succeed from hardship and pain. If the country is not unified, it cannot maintain an independent and equal status. If the country is not unified, it cannot guarantee the people's freedom to promote democratic constitutionalism. If the country is not unified, it cannot carry out economic construction to improve people's lives. The difficulties our country is facing today and the suffering the people are enduring are all caused by the Communist bandits' rebellion. If the Communist bandits are not wiped out for a day, the country cannot be unified for a day. Not only will the people's hardships be impossible to alleviate, the economic crisis will be impossible to save, but the independent survival of the entire nation will not be guaranteed, and finally it will inevitably tend to complete destruction. Looking at the spread of the Communist bandits' rebellion and the expansion of their conspiracy in the past year, it is obvious that their ultimate goal is to reduce our China to a vassal and trap our compatriots into slavery, and then use our Chinese territory, people and all material resources as tools to endanger world peace. Understanding this meaning, we can know why our country, when its vitality had not recovered from eight years of hard fighting, had to endure the pain and engage in mobilization to quell the rebellion. We can also know that mobilization to quell the rebellion is the inescapable responsibility of all patriotic compatriots and patriotic youth in China.</p>
<p>Our revolutionary and national construction cause has encountered countless setbacks, shocks, and difficulties. From Yuan Shikai's imperial system, Zhang Xun's restoration, the warlord separatism to the Japanese imperialist aggression, all were destroyed by our national spirit and the revolutionary forces of the Three Principles of the People. The Communist bandits' rebellion today is inheriting all the clothes of the counter-revolutionaries, and gathers the great achievements of bandits, traitors, reactionary warlords, and imperialist aggressive forces. This kind of domestic turmoil with international ties can be said to be the biggest difficulty encountered since the revolution. It can also be said that today is always the final decisive battle between the national revolution and the counter-revolutionary forces. Only the victory of this decisive battle can consolidate national unity, ensure national independence, complete political democracy, carry out economic construction, and give full play to the spirit of the Chinese nation's love of peace, independence, and self-determination, and eliminate the threats to world peace and human security. I personally joined the Tongmenghui at the age of twenty-two, followed Dr. Sun Yat-sen in the revolution, and this year marks forty years. I feel that this is really the most dangerous and serious battle for life and death since our revolution. But with my forty years of experience in participating in the revolution, I can assert that the victory of this suppression of the rebellion will be more great and meaningful than the gains of any previous revolutionary war. Dr. Sun Yat-sen said, "Anything that conforms to the principles of heaven, responds to the hearts of the people, and is in line with the world trend will not fail." If our compatriots throughout the country can uphold the consistent spirit of the War of Resistance, recognize righteousness, must be able to defeat violence, the truth that human nature must overcome bestiality, unite as one, cooperate unanimously, share weal and woe, and strive hard, then today's final difficulty is the foundation for the final success in the near future. Whether in ancient or modern times, at home or abroad, any bandit or rebel who goes against the principles of heaven and violates the trend of the times will never be eliminated, and the obstacles to revolutionary nation-building and democratic freedom will never be removed. Youth are entrusted with the destiny of the country. As long as the youth of the nation establish the ambition to serve the country, enrich the cultivation of serving the country, understand what is right and wrong, distinguish between obedience and rebellion, give full play to the spirit of struggle, and shoulder the mission of the times, then the future of the country will always be bright, and the cause of the national revolution will inevitably be successful. Today, I want to solemnly encourage the patriotic and ambitious youth of the nation with the following points: (Continued on the left corner of the second page)</p>
<h3>Mo Dehui's Campaign Strength</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 28th Dispatch] In the lineup of candidates for Vice President, Mr. Mo Dehui is undoubtedly a unique banner. He is not an official with real power, nor does he possess a vast array of military commanders. He is simply a non-partisan person without an organization. So, what does he rely on to campaign? In fact, when it comes to it, he has not decided to participate in the campaign. When the Northeastern people in Beijing had already organized a campaign support association for him, the reporter visited him, and he said with a trembling voice: "How can I have the heart to campaign for any Vice President? My home is broken, how can I talk about campaigning?" Old Liu is truly a compassionate person. When this is almost a world of people eating people, he still feels the pain of the country's destruction and the family's death with a compassionate heart. This kindness of his especially shows that it is not only because he was born in Jilin, but more because of "sympathy." However, precisely because of this, the Northeastern people are all spontaneously supporting him and repeatedly urging him to participate in the campaign. Indeed, it was under the circumstances of "overwhelming kindness" that he began to reveal the news that he had agreed to participate in the campaign.</p>
<p>He is a well-known social sage. In the National Political Council, he is always like a moderate who specializes in buffering. In the Kuomintang-Communist Party's several compromises from cooperation to division and from division to cooperation, which time was there no running around by Old Liu! However, he wants to criticize corrupt officials and report inferior governance; he is not a true moderate. It's just that his moderation is towards people, while he must seek truth from facts on matters.</p>
<p>In the hearts of the Northeastern people, he has deeply planted roots, and they will always remember Old Liu. In the past two years, Northeastern condolences, consolation, and relief, fundraising, almost every time he leads, as long as he raises his arms and calls, there is nothing that cannot be done. However, saying this is only in terms of emotion. In fact, what he has done for the Northeastern people is equivalent to connecting the central government and the Northeastern local government. Without his mediation, who among the Northeastern people would not say: "The central government has completely forgotten us!" Who would not say: "The government has decided to abandon the Northeast"! Therefore, some people believe that Old Liu is almost equal to the central government's political power over the overall situation in the Northeast. Now, the President has been unanimously supported by everyone as Chairman Chiang. Chairman Chiang is a Southerner. If the Vice President is also a Southerner, I am afraid that the hearts of the Northerners will cool down, and the central government's politics is still so biased! Still using this kind of biased policy"! Therefore, if Mr. Mo can be appointed as Vice President, it will give the Northeastern people some comfort.</p>
<p>He is unique in this campaign camp, but he will never use any opportunity to rape public opinion. He wants to politely let people vote for him willingly. But he obviously does not have an organized "army." Is it hard to say that he doesn't even have a little strength? Wrong, an observer on the sidelines said to me: "He is non-partisan, so some people in the National Political Council will support him. He is a Northerner, so people from the 29 provinces and cities in North China and the 9 provinces and 3 cities in the Northeast will undoubtedly support him. He is not a member of the Kuomintang, especially since he is the mediator who compromises with various parties, so if the Democratic Socialist Party and the Youth Party do not nominate their own candidates, they will definitely support him. There is another not small force, and that is Catholicism." In this way, Mo Dehui's campaign strength is quite large.</p>
<h3>National Army Meets Between Jinzhou and Yixian; Shenyang Residents Migrate on Foot into the Pass</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Shenyang, 28th] The National Army between Jinzhou and Yixian met on the 27th at Qilihezi, 25 kilometers north of Jinzhou. The air force cooperated to clear out the remaining bandits. The scattered bandits on both sides of the Panan Taizi River have been suppressed, and all ferry crossings are completely under the control of the National Army, which is stabilizing the refugees. The air force is active, bombing cities and towns along the Pingmei Line for days, and the bandit army's supply and transportation have been severely hit.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Shenyang, 28th] For days, about five or six hundred residents have been traveling on foot from Suizhong to Jinzhou and then into the Pass. They carry small bags with them, and it takes about seven days to reach. They have become an endless stream of migrants. Those who can take a long-term view will find that today's national situation is far better than the initial stage of the War of Resistance. Recalling the first meeting of this council in Wuhan, at that time the capital was still under enemy occupation, and there was no definite certainty about the military, political, and diplomatic situation. What we relied on to fight was only our sincere dedication to the country and the people and our confidence in the country and the nation. Today, however, the foundation of the country has been soundly established by the efforts of all colleagues in the past ten years. If we have firm confidence, there is no danger for the future of the country and the nation, and all difficulties can be overcome. Now that this council has ended, your responsibilities to the country and the nation still exist. Therefore, I hope that you will still maintain the determination to go to the country's difficulties together ten years ago, continue the efforts of the past ten years as one day, assist the government, share weal and woe, and complete the mission of suppressing the rebellion and building the country.</p>

<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 27th] The Senate Foreign Relations Committee's report criticizing the Chinese government was revoked on the 27th by Senate President Vandenberg.

The report, which condemned the Chinese government's incompetence and corruption, was released simultaneously with the committee's approval of a $463 million aid package to China on the 26th. Vandenberg stated that the report was not reviewed by the committee or himself, and it does not represent the opinions of all thirteen members of the Foreign Relations Committee, of which he is the chairman.

<h3>Editorial: Taking the First Step Towards Democratic Constitutionalism</h3>
<p>—— Commemorating Revolutionary Martyrs and Celebrating the 5th Youth Day</p>
<p>Today is the Memorial Day for Revolutionary Martyrs, as well as the 5th Youth Day. The first National Assembly under the Constitution will also open today in the capital, further emphasizing the significance of commemorating the Revolutionary Martyrs and celebrating Youth Day. The fundamental task of this National Assembly is to exercise the powers vested in it by the Constitution, to complete the organization of a democratically elected government, thereby ending the one-party responsible system, and to allow all peaceful and legitimate political parties in the country to share political responsibility according to the path prescribed by the Constitution. Therefore, today marks the first step for our country to steadily embark on democratic constitutionalism; it is also a major key to our country's peace, unity, democracy, and strength. As we remember the heroic sacrifices of the revolutionary martyrs of the past, face the various crises we face today, and look forward to the future of our nation, we cannot but place all our hopes entirely on the youth of today, and further hope that the Constitutional National Assembly convened this time can lay a solid foundation for our country's democratic constitutionalism.</p>
<p>Recalling the revolutionary movements before the founding of the Republic of China, we do not know how many acts of righteousness were undertaken, with predecessors falling and successors continuing, without knowing how much blood was shed, nor how many heads were lost! Everyone knows that these are glorious historical records written in blood by our Chinese revolutionary youth: whether it is collective action or individual acts of "killing oneself to achieve benevolence" or "sacrificing oneself to take righteousness," they are all tearful; especially on this day thirty-seven years ago, the seventy-two martyrs of Huanghuagang made a heroic sacrifice, which was truly enough to move heaven and earth and weep ghosts and gods. Although this revolutionary movement failed, the blood of the seventy-two martyrs was not shed in vain. Their great spirit of sacrifice not only awakened the sleeping national soul, but also gave the Chinese people a great spiritual appeal, laying the foundation for the success of the revolution. Therefore, our country's revolutionary movement, from beginning to end, has been built on the shoulders of revolutionary youth.</p>
<p>From the sacrifice of the seventy-two martyrs of Huanghuagang to today, thirty-seven years have passed. During this period, relying on the blood and heads of the martyrs, although we overthrew the corrupt and autocratic Qing Dynasty, although we eliminated the warlords who were constantly engaged in civil war, although we defeated the invading Japanese imperialism and abolished all unequal treaties, we are still far from the ultimate goal of the National Revolution. Nationalism has not yet been thoroughly completed, democracy has just begun, and the People's Livelihood has not yet been realized; moreover, our country's founding and revitalization are still full of obstacles and thorns. Today, as we commemorate the martyrs, celebrate Youth Day, and open the first Constitutional National Assembly, all of us should face reality, deeply reflect, and seek a thorough awakening of the entire country, and quickly seek a major plan for innovation and renewal.</p>
<p>First, the most important task of the government today is to suppress the rebellion and build the country, and the only basic task of the future democratically elected government is also to quell the rebellion and build the country: and if the source of chaos spread by the communist bandits in the country cannot be suppressed and eradicated, then the work of nation-building cannot be carried out. But how can we quell the rebellion without causing it to become more chaotic? President Chiang issued a statement on the 27th stating: "Today's national situation is extremely serious: the poisonous flames of the communist bandits are so rampant. Only by jointly maintaining the dignity of the Constitution and establishing the foundation of democratic politics by all patriots and people with lofty ideals in the country, and only by jointly following the path of party politics, mutually understanding and cooperating, establishing a constitutional government, abiding by the Constitution, and assuming the heavy responsibility of guaranteeing the freedom of the people, implementing basic national policies, and maintaining national territorial sovereignty, can we overcome difficulties and complete the mission of suppressing the rebellion and building the country." From President Chiang's edict, it can also be seen that political democratization is the only broad road for our country to quell the rebellion and build the country. At present, the political "corruption and incompetence" of our country, manipulated by "powerful families" and "bureaucrats," has become an undeniable fact, and everyone is aware of the need for thorough reform. According to the methods of democratic countries, the steps to reform politics; first, open up speech, widely solicit public opinion, and the government should take public opinion as its basis for all domestic and foreign measures; second, expand the foundation of democracy, recruit domestic talents, and implement the supreme principle of "using people according to their talents" in both the central government and local governments, and thoroughly eliminate bureaucratic politics; third, institutionalize the administrative system, not only implement hierarchical responsibility, but also establish a civil service system to improve administrative efficiency. Everyone knows that suppressing bandits and quelling the rebellion is 30% military and 70% political, and the thorough reform of politics is a necessary condition for completing the suppression of the rebellion. I hope that after the closing of this National Assembly and the establishment of a democratically elected government, we can make drastic reforms in politics, renew our faces, and start afresh with the people.</p>
<p>Second, to quell the rebellion, we must first study the origin of the chaos. The surge in the communist bandits' arrogance is certainly due to the government's mistake in seeking peace at the beginning of the victory, missing the opportunity, and allowing the communist bandits to expand their power and territory. However, it has been almost a year since the government explicitly ordered the suppression of the rebellion, but the strength of the communist bandits has not weakened, and the area in which they are creating chaos has expanded. At present, there is a phenomenon in the country of quelling the rebellion but becoming more and more chaotic, and the key to this is worth our attention. Today, China seems to be suffering from a body of problems. We must not "avoid treatment for fear of disease," but should concentrate on diagnosis to investigate the source of the disease? Then, we can prescribe medicine according to the symptoms. According to our deep reflection, in addition to political corruption and incompetence, the most important factor in creating the current serious situation is that although the Kuomintang government believes in the Three People's Principles of the Founding Father, it only knows how to sit and talk, but does not know how to take action. In particular, the People's Livelihood of the Founding Father has methods for regulating capital for the economic control of the capital, and has proposals for equalizing land rights for rural society to achieve the ideal of "farmers have their land." These economic reform plans that are beneficial to national needs and people's livelihoods have not been effectively implemented, but have been stolen by the communist bandits, who use "small capitalism" and "land reform" as slogans. Not to mention that ordinary ignorant farmers will blindly follow, even foreign reporters mistakenly believe that the communist bandits are a political party that advocates "land reform." This misstep of the Kuomintang cannot be denied, and it cannot but be deeply reflected upon. For the current plan, we can only catch up quickly, make a painful determination, and immediately implement the People's Livelihood of the Founding Father to relieve the suffering of the majority of the people. All parts of the country, whether in the buffer zone or in the rear, or even in the Jinghu District, have reached the stage of "people's livelihood is difficult." The stabilization and improvement of people's livelihood is already urgent. Fortunately, "hungry people are easy to feed, and thirsty people are easy to drink." As long as the government can make a painful determination and implement the People's Livelihood regardless of all obstacles, it is very easy to see results.</p>
<p>Third, suppressing the rebellion and building the country requires the efforts of the government, but it is also difficult to succeed without the assistance of the people. Everyone knows that China is an agricultural society, and most of the people have no knowledge; they do not know what politics is at all, and even if their lives are painful, they do not know how to express their opinions on national affairs. Therefore, China's democratic politics is very different from the situation in other countries. At present, our country needs selfless knowledge and youth, who can understand the sufferings of the majority of the people, think for them, and speak for them. On the one hand, they can express public opinion as the basis for the government's policies, and on the other hand, they can unite into a force to urge the government to innovate and progress, so that government officials can truly become servants of the people. Therefore, we look forward to the establishment of the government elected in accordance with the Constitution after the opening of this National Assembly. On the one hand, we wish the National Assembly success, and on the other hand, we hope that the knowledge and youth of the whole country will stand up, review national affairs, observe the people's conditions, speak for the people, and urge the government to thoroughly reform and implement the democratization of politics and the socialization of the economy, and complete the task of suppressing the rebellion and building the country as soon as possible!</p>

<h3>Taiwan Delegates Will Request Reduction in Taxes Related to Cultural and Educational Undertakings</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 28th] Taiwan Province delegates Lin Zigui and others are planning to ask the government to reduce or exempt taxes related to education and cultural undertakings, popularize social education, and improve the people's intelligence, in order to benefit the Constitution and promote revival. Taking advantage of their visit to Nanjing to attend the meeting, they will ask delegates from various regions to co-sign the proposal and submit it to the government for review and implementation. The proposal explains that the first priority for revival and construction and the implementation of self-government should be to improve the people's intelligence and popularize social education. However, in the current various tax laws, educational and cultural undertakings such as movies, dramas, publications, bookstores, book fairs, singing venues, ballrooms, and skating rinks are all regarded as profit-making businesses and are subject to business tax, banquet and entertainment tax, stamp tax, etc., and many are taxed at a higher rate than general businesses. The tax rate for the materials needed for the newspaper industry is also the same as other industries and should also be reasonably adjusted. The measures are: (1) Theater groups, performing troupes, or song and dance visiting groups that are purely for publicity and educational purposes or contain local cultural exchange significance should be exempt from various taxes. (2) Entertainment businesses with educational properties, such as movie theaters, theaters, and film merchants, should reduce various taxes to the lowest amount. (3) Bookstores and publishing industries should also be reduced or exempted from taxes. (4) The mailing fees for newspapers and the paper fees for news telegrams and telephones should be reduced to the lowest limit. Newspapers, inks, etc. should be universally allocated by the government and distributed fairly by the county or province to the Executive Yuan and the competent authorities on a regular basis.</p>

<h3>Improving Kaohsiung Oil Refinery: Expanding Machinery and Equipment</h3>
<p>Plant Manager Talks Upon Returning from Inspection in Iran</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Kaohsiung, 28th] Bin Guo, the manager of the Kaohsiung Refinery, was sent to Iran for inspection and has recently returned to Kaohsiung. According to his remarks, the Iranian refinery is currently the largest refinery in the world. The British began developing Iran in 1901 and discovered rich oil fields in 1908. The following year, the Anglo-Persian Oil Company was established and began refining oil. It was renamed the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company in 1935. The refining business developed year by year. Last year, crude oil production reached 21 million tons, and 400,000 barrels of gasoline were refined daily. The purpose of his inspection was to find ways to improve the Kaohsiung Refinery. The plant is currently continuously supplementing a large number of machines recently shipped from the United States. Currently, it can refine 15,000 barrels of oil per day. After the new equipment is completed, the refining capacity can be increased to 50,000 barrels. The biggest problem for the plant is the unsmooth transportation of crude oil. After the expiration of the contract for 300,000 tons of crude oil signed by the Resources Commission and the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company of Iran last year, this year the contract has been changed to Texaco of Arabia, and the China Oil Tanker Company's Yonghong and Yongze vessels are responsible for transportation, but only 10,000 tons of crude oil enter the port each month, which is only enough for the plant to refine for ten days. The Yonghao, a 10,000-ton oil tanker under repair at Kaohsiung Port, will also participate in transportation in a few months. As for some technical issues, some personnel withdrawn from the Jinxi Refinery in Northeast China may be sent to Kaohsiung to assist.</p>

<h3>Chairman's Letter to the Nation's Youth</h3>
<p>Deliberate and Discern: Recognize the Enemies of the Nation</p>
<p>(Continued from Page 1) First, young people should deliberate and discern, and recognize the enemies of the nation. Young people should have ardent emotions, and at the same time, they should have rich intellect. Today, the reasons for young people's sadness, anger, and vexation are certainly not just one. Some are vexed by the country's many disasters, some are vexed by economic imbalances, some are vexed by unreasonable politics, and some are vexed by social evils and personal futures. In fact, our most urgent task at present is to eliminate the Communist bandits and eliminate the Communist bandits. Because the Communist bandits are the biggest obstacle to the country's revival, disrupting social order, cutting off people's livelihoods, and hindering political reforms. If the Communist bandits are not eliminated for a day, young people will not have a bright future for a day. The Communist bandits are the enemies of the country, and they are also the enemies of your young people. The Communist bandits and the tools of the Communist bandits use you, deceive you, and ruin you. All kinds of tricks were also deeply expressed in various student movements last year. Who caused your difficult life? Who provoked your youthful emotions? Who coerced you not to have the freedom to express your opinions and personal actions? Who ruined your good time and destroyed your learning environment? I think you should have a clear judgment. The so-called "professional students," who do not attend classes all year round, never graduate, mix into your ranks, steal your name, confuse your vision, force your actions, and disrupt your order, you should have a clear understanding of them. My patriotic youth, how does the country nurture you, how does society expect you, but the Communist bandits do not recognize that you have independent personalities, but treat you as objects, not as people, and want to use you as their tools to betray the country and harm the people. This is an intolerable insult. If you ignore the crimes of the Communist bandits and tolerate the existence of the Communist bandits, that is a stain on the glorious history of the revolutionary youth of China. Therefore, I call on you to deliberate and discern, and recognize that the Communist bandits are your own enemies. For the sake of the country, for the sake of the compatriots who have been harmed, you should support the , eradicate the Communist , in order to maintain your purity, wash away your shame, and show your courage as young people, you should unite and rise up to eliminate the Communist bandits in your ranks.</p>
<p>Work Hard and Diligently: Strive for Academic Progress</p>
<p>Second, young people must work hard and diligently and strive for academic progress. For China to stand in modern international society, it must complete various constructions and seek upward progress in academic culture. Now is the era of science. Science has changed nature and science has increased human welfare. Since this war, the relationship between science and human destiny has been even more significant. However, the development of science comes from continuous research, bit by bit, and can never be achieved overnight. For the past ten years, amidst the hardships of the War of Resistance Against Japan, the work of academic research has still achieved considerable results, which cannot but be attributed to the efforts of the academic community. However, if we want to develop industries, complete construction, and enrich the national economy and people's livelihood, not only is the level of scientific research too low, but the quantity is also too small. The youth of our country must have the determination to catch up, work diligently and diligently, and not be distracted. In the classroom, in the laboratory, in the library, in the factory, concentrate on the research of science and the improvement of technology , no matter how difficult it is, we must always work hard and not , catch up with the times, and seek progress. This is the great responsibility of benefiting the country and the people. I hope that ambitious young people will take it on resolutely.</p>
<p>Abide by the Law and Respect Discipline: Establish a Democratic Model</p>
<p>Third, young people must abide by the law and respect discipline and establish a democratic model. Our country has now entered the stage of democratic constitutionalism. The concrete realization of democracy does not only rely on a set of systems or forms. The main thing is that the whole country can have the habit of the rule of law, understand the distinction of freedom, and from the government to the society, everyone abides by the law, everything abides by the law, so that perfect constitutionalism can be achieved, and the people of the whole country can receive real welfare. The youth of our country are the vanguard leading reforms and the future backbone of the country. They should have the spirit of abiding by the law and respecting discipline and the democratic demeanor of respecting the freedom of others. What was manifested in the student movements of last year was that schools were more chaotic than society. Many Communist bandits and young people who were willing to be directed by others regarded themselves as a special class, outside the laws and disciplines of the country. Teachers can be insulted, school rules can be broken, students can be coerced, and even the freedom of others and other schools can be interfered with. This phenomenon almost wants to pull China, which is advancing to the democratic avenue in the 20th century, back to the original society, the era of exclusive violence. It is really not suitable for modern Chinese youth. I sincerely hope that my young people will reflect on their sacred responsibility to the country and the nation, correct their views, reform their lives, respect reason, respect order, and establish a neat school spirit, so that social customs can be changed, and true democracy can be realized.</p>
<p>Face Reality: Inherit the Spirit of the Martyrs</p>
<p>Youths of the country, now our country and people are facing a great test again. Whether our country can be independent and self-sufficient, whether our nation can prosper, depends on whether we can unite the power of patriotic people across the country, whether we can eliminate obstacles to unified nation-building, whether we can eliminate the rebellion of the Communist bandits, and whether we can implement the Three Principles of the People, the principles of our country. According to past history, whenever the beliefs of young people are consistent, their actions are consistent, their will is concentrated, and their strength is concentrated, it is when our country overcomes difficulties and opens up to light. As long as we can inherit the spirit of the revolutionary martyrs who sacrificed themselves for the country, understand the great significance of the Youth Day, face reality, shoulder arduous tasks, endure hardship and hard work, and actively struggle, then we will not only be able to maintain the glorious history of hard work created by the martyrs, but also be able to eliminate the bandit disaster, eliminate obstacles, and build a new China with the Three Principles of the People, prosperous, strong, and happy.</p>

<h3>Ma Qing Leads Delegation to Bogota: Pan-American Conference to Open Tomorrow; To Discuss Anti-Communist Treaty in the Western Hemisphere</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Bogota, 28th] The Pan-American Conference is scheduled to be officially opened here next Tuesday by Colombian President Velez. The U.S. delegation is led by Marshall himself, and includes Treasury Secretary Snyder, Commerce Secretary Harriman, Export-Import Bank Accountant Martin, and Ambassador to Brazil Paulley, with an unparalleled strong lineup. Guatemala's proposal to end the colonies of England, France, and the Netherlands in Central and South America will be submitted for discussion at the meeting. However, those concerned expect that the United States, Argentina, Chile, and Venezuela will oppose this proposal, believing that it is not appropriate to weaken the solidarity of Western allies and the Western Hemisphere in today's tense international situation. Mexico, Brazil, Colombia, and most Central American countries, who have doubts about the government of President Alawiro of Guatemala, are also expected to support the United States. In addition, the U.S. policy may be to require the conference to establish a broad economic constitution to reduce trade restrictions and open up channels for private investment.</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 27th] U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Yahil flew to Columbia City today to participate in the American Conference. The advance team of senior American representatives has also left here. Secretary of State Marshall and Commerce Secretary Harriman also left here this afternoon. Marshall said that despite the tense international situation, he still plans to attend the entire meeting, which is scheduled to last for six weeks to two months, but Marshall also plans to fly back to Washington when necessary.</p>
<p>[United Press, Bogota, 28th] The Pan-American Conference will open on the 30th, and the preparatory staff is feeling apprehensive due to the lack of electricity in Colombia and the partial failure of telecommunications equipment here. Colombia has experienced six months of severe sheep farming, resulting in a near-depleted supply of materials, and the reduction in hydropower electricity has led to fears that the U.S. Army's starter motor will be borrowed during the conference. There is only one line between here and North America and Central America , which was recently damaged, and telecommunications rely on only three wireless motors for maintenance.</p>
<h3>US Military Authority Defined; Army Reserve Officers Ordered to Remain; General Bradley to Tour Pacific This Summer</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 27th] Secretary of Defense Forrestal announced that disagreements among the US military branches have been resolved. Forrestal presented to the President the report of the Joint Chiefs of Staff's meeting at the Key West Naval Base in Florida from March 11th to 14th, stating that the mission of each branch has been clearly defined. The Air Force's primary mission will be strategic and tactical operations; the Navy's primary mission is to conduct aerial tactics to achieve objectives in naval warfare; and the Naval Air Force, under the command of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, may participate in air combat missions. The Navy may engage any target to fulfill its mission. The Navy's primary mission is to prevent submarine activity, while the Air Force will only provide auxiliary support. Forrestal pointed out that the most important principle is to achieve victory in any future war the United States participates in with the most economical use of time and manpower. The Marine Corps' mission is primarily amphibious warfare and its main focus will be on developing amphibious warfare techniques and equipment.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 27th] The Department of the Army revealed today that 20,000 reserve officers on active duty, originally slated for demobilization, will remain in their positions pending congressional decisions on conscription.

<h3>Strange Submarine Spotted 60 Miles from Kinmen</h3>
<p>[United Press, San Francisco, 27th] Naval authorities announced today that a Pan American Clipper pilot, Mr. Mei You, reported seeing an unidentified submarine approximately sixty miles southwest of Kinmen (the entrance to the largest US naval base) before dawn today. The submarine immediately submerged. The Navy has dispatched multiple aircraft to search for it. No submarines are stationed in that area, and if the report is accurate, the submarine is definitely not American. Previously, some in naval circles speculated it might be the US submarine "Carp," which was currently conducting exercises, but "Carp" remains docked in Monterey Bay.</p>
<h3>American Experts Analyze: Soviet Strength Immense</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, New York, 27th] New York Times military analyst Baldwin stated that the Soviet Union's army is superior and its territory spans Western Europe and East Asia. Therefore, should war occur, the Soviet Union could quickly seize Europe, Korea, the Middle East, Northeast China, and North China. According to Baldwin, who has studied Soviet military strength, if the Soviet army and its vassal states' armies launched an offensive tomorrow, they could occupy Korea within days or weeks, reach the Yellow River basin within three months, and occupy Austria, Hungary, France, Germany, Denmark, Holland, Belgium, etc., within forty-five days. Baldwin stated that although the Soviet army is strong, with 94 divisions, its equipment is inferior, especially lacking aircraft and ships. The Soviet Union is currently assisting in improving the armies of its vassal states, standardizing them. He believes the Soviets are indeed preparing for a future major war, but will they launch an actual invasion? Baldwin believes the Soviet economic and industrial plans indicate long-term preparation, not emergency preparation. Moreover, the Soviets are currently achieving great success through political ideology, economics, and fomenting rebellion. Therefore, the Soviet Union will not risk war while it is benefiting greatly from these methods.</p>
<h3>Soviet Attitude Unpredictable; Finns Surprised; Suspect More Tricks Up Their Sleeve</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Helsinki, 28th] Moscow's policy in the Soviet-Finnish treaty negotiations remains difficult for the Finnish side to grasp. The slowness of the Soviet side has surprised the Finns, but there is little doubt that the Soviets still have tricks up their sleeves. Observers already believe that the strong statements from Washington over the past week have had some effect. They believe the Soviet Union may therefore adjust its political strategy in Northern Europe to cope with a vigilant United States. Meanwhile, well-informed Finnish sources have denied that Finland has reduced its resistance to Soviet pressure. The Finnish government broke with the traditional Easter holiday to hold an informal meeting today to discuss possible developments in Moscow. Finnish political figures believe the Soviet Union has not yet laid its demands on the table, a situation that surprises the Finns. New developments are expected in the Moscow negotiations at any time.</p>
<h3>Soviet Union Rejects Iranian Protest Regarding Border Military Activities</h3>

<h3>Twenty-Nine US Merchant Ships Transferred to Italy</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Wilmington, North Carolina, 27th] The Italian government officially received twenty-nine US merchant ships today, which President Truman ordered to be transferred to Italy on March 19th.

<h3>Czechoslovak Arms Industry Entirely Under Soviet Control; Integrated with Romania, Bulgaria, and Other Countries into a Single Economic Unit</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 27th] Following the Communist coup in Czechoslovakia, the Soviet Union has seized control of the large-scale Skoda arms industry, which served as Europe's armory during both World Wars. Military experts say the Soviet Union has already achieved its actual goal of controlling the Skoda arms factory since the Red Army entered Czechoslovakia. Those engaged in assessing the war potential within the Communist and anti-Communist spheres of influence have long considered Skoda no longer an asset to the potential war efforts of Western nations. The Communist seizure of power two weeks ago has further confirmed their estimates.</p>
<p>The Skoda factory includes 35 major plants, producing everything from plowshares and tractors to small arms and artillery. From 1932 to 1937, before Hitler took over, the Skoda factory produced 14 percent of the world's arms exports, and Hitler expanded it further. Skoda has not completely converted to peacetime production of agricultural tools, railways, and industrial equipment. The factory still accepts military equipment orders from the Soviet Union, Egypt, Sweden, Argentina, Yugoslavia, and Switzerland. According to well-informed military sources, the Forestdings Chaiberro Kovka factory alone produces 25 million rounds of 7.92 caliber bullets, 5 million detonators, 300,000 rounds of 20 cm artillery shells, 20,000 rocket shells, and 1,000 Anglan-style rifles per month. Skoda's industrial production includes agricultural machinery, railway locomotives, and vehicles, most of which have been shipped to the Soviet Union since the war. Czechoslovakia's primary strategic importance lies in its industrial and mineral resources. The country has basic raw materials and power resources for unlimited industrial development. In addition to its rich iron ore deposits and steel industry comparable to the Saar River valley, Czechoslovakia also has important uranium ore deposits, essential for the production of atomic energy and atomic bombs. All production from Czech uranium mines is shipped to the Soviet Union. According to well-informed sources, the Soviet Union wants to link Czechoslovakia's industrial potential with Poland, Hungary, Romania, Yugoslavia, Albania, and Bulgaria, to create a successful economic unit no longer dependent on Western Europe.</p>

<p>[Reuters, Geneva, 27th] The US representative submitted a draft international convention to the International Conference on Freedom of the Press, aiming to make news free from national restrictions and facilitate the activities of foreign journalists. The full text contains approximately sixteen articles, with key points including: (1) Each signatory country shall allow news from other signatory countries to enter its country on a most-favored-nation basis; (2) Inspection, delays, modifications, etc., shall not be implemented unless necessary for military security; (3) Any signatory country may request another signatory country to declare the truth in various ways to correct erroneous reports by foreign journalists; (4) All foreign journalists shall have equal rights to news sources and various locations; (5) Special restrictions shall not be imposed on the entry and exit of foreign journalists.

<p>[Central News Agency, Geneva, 27th, United Press] Philippine representative Borromeo told the Committee on Freedom of News Publication and Adoption: The Philippines is determined to support any proposal that protects freedom of news and speech, regardless of race, nationality, religion, or political affiliation. He stated, "We are well aware that this freedom has been abused by irresponsible individuals. However, abuses of this nature have been corrected in a timely manner by public opinion itself. Only in a system that controls public opinion, where people do not choose to think freely or speak freely, and thus controlled public opinion, cannot actively take the necessary corrective measures."</p>
<p>[United Press, Geneva, 27th] During the United Nations Conference on Freedom of the Press, representatives from the Soviet Union, Poland, and Hungary spoke on the spot, fiercely attacking American newspapers. The Hungarian representative cited the words of US Senator Bridges, saying that the United States intends to support underground anti-communist movements in Eastern Europe.</p>
<h3>Yugoslavia Increases Defenses in Trieste; Italian Communist Leader Attacks Britain and America</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Rome, 28th] According to reports received here on the morning of the 28th: There have been significant troop movements in the Yugoslav-occupied area of ​​Trieste. The message stated that 2,000 Yugoslav troops have arrived in Zgonik, and all housing in the area has been ordered to be vacated to accommodate the troops. This incident has deeply impressed the residents. It was also reported that after the US cruiser "Tidewater" left the Port of Trieste on a ten-day cruise, the 10,000-ton cruiser "Minneapolis" immediately arrived at the Port of Trieste.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Trieste, 28th] The agreement by Britain, the United States, and France to return the Port of Trieste to Italy has been a major blow to the Communist Party in the Port of Trieste. Attendance at last week's Communist Party meeting was only two to four thousand people, whereas in past leftist demonstrations, participants often numbered over thirty thousand. Meanwhile, Major General Airey, commander of the British-American military forces in Trieste, issued a declaration today denying rumors of future British troop reinforcements, stating that the British-American zone of Trieste is very peaceful, and there is no reason to believe that this stability will not continue.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Rome, 27th] Italian Communist leader Togliatti delivered a speech to 70,000 people here, stating that Western countries want to drag Italy into another war to confront the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe. He urged Italians to use their votes on April 18 to stop this policy of the United States and Western countries, letting them understand that Italy is determined not to adhere to a policy of war and not to align with the interests of the Italian people. Togliatti firmly stated that the People's Democratic Front must achieve victory at any cost, as only the People's Democratic Front can establish a solid barrier to prevent those who would betray the country. Togliatti also mentioned the issue of the Port of Trieste, saying that Western countries are trying to show that the Communist Party and the Socialist Party oppose the return of Trieste to Italy, in order to provoke an Italian nationalist movement and allow the reactionary faction to defeat the democratic forces. However, Yugoslavia has declared its willingness to review the treaty with a democratic Italy regarding the clauses of the Port of Trieste. The fact that Britain, the United States, and France do not seek Yugoslavia's opinion is an attempt to preserve the Italian Eastern Border issue, making it a potential flashpoint for a major war.</p>
<h3>Pope's Easter Broadcast</h3>
<p>[United Press, Vatican City, 28th] Pope Pius XII delivered an Easter blessing in St. Peter's Square today and declared to the people that the time has come for Christians to be aware, to have courage, and to follow their conscience and vocation, and not to blindly follow those who deny religion and reject the sacred.

At that time, Home Minister Roy criticized the recent Communist annual conference held in Calcutta, which had approved the organization of a "People's Army."

<h3>Amazing Flying Ability of Homing Pigeons; Long Journeys Without Sleep or Food</h3>
<p>Highest Record of Over 30 Hours for Flying from Tianjin to Shanghai; Choosing Well-Bred Mates and Forcibly Mating Several Times Each Year</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Special Report] In the two World Wars, homing pigeons performed their greatest function in countless battles; in the campaign to encircle and suppress Ding Xishan, intelligence liaison between Songhu and Shanghai also relied partially on homing pigeons. There are quite a few homing pigeons in Shanghai, but apart from those for military use, most are still serving as "professional athletes" for competitions. Although homing pigeons are non-productive animals, people who raise homing pigeons still have a strong interest, and it is said that the pleasure in this is far greater than appreciating cricket fighting or listening to songbirds sing. Judging homing pigeons cannot simply rely on appearance. Beautiful feathers and imposing appearance are often the most useless things. Like the famous breeds "Stassart" and "Bricoux," which belong to the original Belgian breeds of homing pigeons, their appearance is plain and unassuming, and they are quiet and rarely move, but they can often perform amazingly in flight. These "famous pigeons" are now imported from foreign countries, and are worth 100 US dollars a pair. The seller must provide a "pigeon family tree" when selling, with great-grandparents, uncles, and brothers all recorded in detail. The breeder must choose a well-bred mate for it, forcibly marrying it several times a year, and must also continue the genealogy for it, distinguishing between collateral and orthodox lines, and must not be wrong or mistaken, until its death.</p>
<p>Maintaining the Breed; Emphasizing Lineage</p>
<p>The marriage of homing pigeons is most valued by breeders, because in order to continue to maintain excellent lineage, they often make extremely clear distinctions regarding the pigeon's noble ancestry. Pigeons from different lineages cannot be combined, and pigeons with too close a relationship and bloodline cannot be combined, otherwise the breed will be mixed and confused, and the intelligence and flying ability of the next generation of pigeons will be significantly reduced. Before the transfer of Japanese military homing pigeons after the war, the breeding record tables were burned. Later, a portion of the excellent homing pigeons were transferred and scattered among the people. Because it was impossible to investigate their ancestral origin, breeders could only hastily arrange marriages for them. According to statistics, almost none of the young pigeons hatched after this kind of "free combination" can exceed the standards of their parents in any respect.</p>
<p>Extraordinary Talent; Establishing Distinguished Service</p>
<p>The origins of homing pigeons can be immediately seen when they officially fly. Xi Baoru, director of the Homing Pigeon Association, had a young pigeon that, before it was even five months old, flew back to Shanghai from Wuhu. Later, it was released from various ports along the Beijing-Shanghai and Hangzhou lines, and achieved excellent results every time, and never got lost. Turning over its pedigree, it turned out that its father was a competitor who flew back to Shanghai from Wenzhou for the SHC (Shanghai Homing Pigeon Association before the war), and its mother was even more outstanding, having flown back to Shanghai from Fengyang under the SHC in 1937. With extraordinary talent, it established distinguished service. In addition, in a homing pigeon race after the victory, a young pigeon that flew out from Wuxi and won the second place, its father had flown back to Shanghai from Haimen, and its mother was said to be a long-distance flight expert. A family of many outstanding individuals is often discovered in the pigeon family. The highest record for long-distance flight of Chinese homing pigeons is a pigeon belonging to Li Meiling, which flew back to Shanghai from Tianjin before the war, in more than thirty hours. To date, no pigeon has broken this record. There are currently more than 8,000 old pigeons and nearly 4,000 young pigeons in Shanghai, a portion of which have achieved above-standard results, having flown back to Shanghai from Nanjing within the standard time of three and a half hours, which is not inferior to the speed of an airplane.</p>
<p>Five Young Pigeons Released from Yanhu</p>
<p>Suzhou and Kunshan are the Most Difficult to Recognize</p>
<p>Young pigeons hatch in eighteen days, and can be trained to fly after one and a half months. The training method is to go from near to far. Usually, they are first released in the city sky to observe, and it is said that pigeons can identify the location of their nest at this time, determining its distance from the Huangpu River and the International Hotel, and will never forget it after that. Then, the breeder takes it to Nanxiang, Kunshan, and heads north along the various stations of the Beijing-Shanghai and Tianjin-Pukou lines, or south along Jia, Hangzhou, Wenzhou, and Xiamen, going further and further away. Among them, the two stations of Suzhou and Kunshan on the Beijing-Shanghai line are the greatest test of the pigeon's intelligence and ability, because the area is densely covered with lakes and marshes, and the terrain is difficult to recognize. It is very difficult for ten out of ten of the slightly less capable homing pigeons to find their way back to their nest. If they can exceed this and the flying point can reach Wuxi, then the qualification for the competition has already been obtained, and they can participate and show their skills in formal competitions.</p>
<p>Swooping Down Like a Bombing</p>
<p>The perseverance, endurance, and loyalty of homing pigeons are most commendable among small animals. No matter how far the journey, they never eat, sleep, or rest. If there is wind and rain along the way, they fly low. If they encounter falcons, they avoid them. Day and night, they finally reach their nest and stop. Someone once used a telescope to observe the posture of a homing pigeon returning from a long journey. It soars above the clouds, and once it discovers its target, it folds its wings and swoops down, like a dive bomber, brave and calm.</p>
<p>Living in Luxury and Receiving Special Honors</p>
<p>The pigeons of the Shanghai Homing Pigeon Association and the Standard Homing Pigeon Association before the war made many contributions to transmitting intelligence during the War of Resistance Against Japan. After the reorganization and establishment of the Homing Pigeon Association after the victory, almost all of the more than one hundred members are people who have devoted themselves to raising pigeons. They have mostly built rather luxurious pigeon lofts at home, with sanitary facilities, automatic opening and closing doors and windows, and even an electric chronograph board, which is specially used for recording time during competitions. These pigeons live a life of luxury in their limited lifespan of fifteen years, drinking and eating with moderation, and exercising regularly. Usually living in luxury, when they spread their wings and fly all night and the record is completed, they also receive a glorious award. To most people who work hard all their lives and struggle for food and clothing all day long, this kind of happiness is indeed a bit extravagant.</p>

<h3>A Tragedy on Xiangyang South Road: Man Killed, Woman Injured</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Last night around ten o'clock, a man named Zhang Meilong and his girlfriend, Miss Chen, were leaving the public night school attached to the Haiguang Elementary School on Nangyang South Road after class. Miss Chen was riding on Zhang's bicycle when, as they were turning a corner, a ten-wheeled truck suddenly came from behind and knocked them down.

<h3>Over Two Hundred Arrested; To Be Transferred to the Special Criminal Court</h3>
<p>The military and police authorities in Shanghai have recently uncovered a large-scale Communist bandit organization, arresting over two hundred people. The authorities will release detailed information about the case in the coming days. The arrested individuals are to be transferred to the Special Criminal Court for trial. According to a reporter from the Dagong News Agency, the Communist bandits originally planned to launch a "Five Strikes and One Uprising" movement in Shanghai on Labor Day, May 1st, of this year (strikes by workers, students, merchants, teachers, and civil servants, as well as refugee riots) to coordinate with the Communist military operations in northern Jiangsu. Therefore, the Communist bandits in northern Jiangsu loudly proclaimed the slogan "Crossing the River in May" to echo the conspiracy of the Communist bandits in Shanghai. Now that their leadership organization has been uncovered by the authorities, their dream of "Five Strikes and One Uprising" has been shattered. The Communist bandits' plan for "Five Strikes and One Uprising" is hereby revealed as follows:</p>
<p>Strikes by Workers</p>
<p>Since the "September 9th Tragedy," the Communist bandits have been using the incident to mobilize their labor cadres under the city committee to go around under the guise of raising donations to console the workers injured and killed in the "September 9th" incident, conducting anti-government propaganda and raising the slogan of abolishing wage deductions. Tao Yunshan, the self-confessed chairman of the silk weaving industry union in the third district, and the Communist Party member Shen Mo in the union, Yang Ming (female) of the Taikang Canning Company, Hu Xiujuan of the Guanghua Knitting Factory in the second district, Pan Xuezhen of the Kangfu Factory, and Lu Xiuying, etc. (all of the above have been arrested), as well as certain elements in the public utility machinery industry, have been very active in this matter, attempting to expand the disturbances and create a citywide general strike.</p>
<p>Strikes by Students</p>
<p>In the student movement aspect, they plan to continue creating an atmosphere of the "Kowloon Incident," and then mobilize college and middle school students and their families to launch a petition movement under the pretext of being unable to afford tuition, with the ultimate goal of boycotting classes.</p>
<p>Strikes by Merchants</p>
<p>This spring, the Communist bandits issued a so-called "CPC Civil Movement Work Instructions," which instructed their hidden cadres in Shanghai on the commercial front to coordinate with the labor and student movements, rebuild the core, and use the slogans of "Resisting American Goods" and "Launching Tax Evasion" as the center of activity, in order to achieve a united strike by merchants.</p>
<p>Strikes by Teachers</p>
<p>They plan to intensify public school teachers' emotions regarding their personal interests, using the faculty and staff of various schools as the main force and civil servants as a shield, to launch a campaign to fight for monthly salary adjustments and maintain the original rations, and implement strikes by teachers when necessary.</p>
<p>Strikes by Civil Servants</p>
<p>They plan to mobilize the city's police force, using low income and inability to make a living as a rallying cry to start a strike. As for the above two items of teachers and civil servants, since the public school teachers have a high level of education and are aware of the Communist bandits' conspiracy, the Communist Party has no way to infiltrate. As for the police, since the organization is strict, strikes by teachers and civil servants cannot be implemented.</p>
<p>Refugee Riots</p>
<p>If the aforementioned "Five Strikes and One Uprising" occurs, they will incite the refugees from northern Jiangsu, Anhui, Shandong, and other places who have fled to Shanghai, using slogans such as soaring prices, people unable to make a living, and demanding relief, to launch citywide looting and large-scale riots, so as to cause social unrest and achieve the goal of popular rebellion.</p>
<h3>Taikang Head Factory Resumes Work Yesterday</h3>
<p>Workers at the Taikang Canning Company stopped working a few days ago due to the instigation of a few individuals because some of them, including female worker Yang Ming and Shui Zhang, were suspected of being reactionary and were arrested in the recent crackdown by the authorities. After persuasion by members of the social circles, all the workers understood the greater meaning, so they resumed work yesterday. However, since yesterday was Sunday, which was originally a day off with the power off, the factory temporarily requested the power company to connect the power, and started work at 2:00 pm. The situation in the factory is currently very good.</p>
<h3>Case of Norwegian Running Black Market for US Dollars Uncovered; Evidence and Case Files Transferred to District Procuratorate for Investigation</h3>
<p>The Garrison Headquarters recently uncovered an international financial disruption case. A Norwegian named Yingsheng, who runs the Yingsheng Foreign Firm at Room 314, Huiluo Building, 401 Sichuan Road in this city, secretly specializes in running a black market for US dollars. After being reported to the Garrison Headquarters, they immediately sent undercover agents and borrowed 10,000 US dollars from the Shanghai Financial Administration in advance. They then pretended to negotiate a transaction with the person in charge of the firm, Yingsheng, and immediately agreed to exchange 10,000 US dollars for 1,182 million legal tender. At that time, Poles Gu Bingsiji and Rosenberk were also in the firm engaging in buying and selling. The agents pre-arranged by the Garrison Headquarters suddenly rushed out and arrested Yingsheng, Gu Bingsiji, Rosenberk, and others, and searched out a large batch of documents and US dollars. After the department interrogated them, they transferred the entire case file to the District Procuratorate yesterday for investigation on the charge of disrupting finance. The case is currently being investigated by the prosecutor Quan Tao of the procuratorate.</p>
<h3>Suspicion of Embezzlement Through Sale of Stocks; Old Case Reorganized at Jiangsu Provincial Bank; Director Yan Huiyu Reported; Investigation Difficult Due to Length of Time</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Yan Huiyu, managing director of Jiangsu Provincial Bank, was reported by the Jiangsu Provincial Government and the Jiangsu Provincial Assembly for selling more than 10,000 shares of official shares of Nantong Dasheng Textile Factory without authorization. The case is currently under investigation by agencies in this city. After Jiangsu Province fell in the autumn of 1948, Yan took some of the bank's employees to take refuge in the Shanghai Concession. Due to the high expenses, he sold more than 10,000 shares of Nantong Dasheng Textile Factory, which the bank held, to Jin Cheng Bank for more than 190,000 yuan (now worth about 30 billion yuan), and telegraphed the head office for approval, but the head office did not approve. Later, due to the prolonged war, no one pursued the matter. After the victory, Jiangsu Provincial Bank resumed business and reorganized the old files, discovering that more than 10,000 shares of Dasheng Textile Factory were missing. When Yan was asked, he said that the money was used to maintain the livelihood of the Shanghai-based employees at that time and had been used up. Because it was an emergency, he did not follow the usual procedures. The Jiangsu Provincial Government and the Jiangsu Provincial Assembly believed that Yan had sold the official shares without obtaining legal procedures and could not say that there was no suspicion of embezzlement. Since the incident occurred in this city, they sent a letter to the judicial authorities of this city for handling, which also involved Lu Zidong, a member of the business community in this city. Yan and Lu were interrogated a few days ago. However, because the case occurred a long time ago, most of the Jiangsu Provincial Bank's files have been burned by the enemy and puppets, and the Dasheng stocks have also changed hands several times, making the investigation very difficult. The judicial authorities have sent letters to relevant agencies to inquire, but have not received a reply so far. The case still needs to summon the parties involved for a decision.</p>
<h3>Poor Woman Found Dead on Tianping Road</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] In front of the Lianyie Motor Company at the intersection of Tianping Road and Yuan Road, around 2:00 pm yesterday, a young woman, about twenty years old, was found lying dead on the ground, dressed in rags, looking like a beggar. After being discovered by the police on duty, the report was made to the Xujiahui Police Station. Since no family members were found, the body was sent to the Tongren Fu Yuan Hall, and the District Procuratorate was notified to send someone to examine it today.</p>
<h3>Shareholders' Meeting of China Book Company Passes Resolutions on Capital Increase, Etc.</h3>
<p>Yesterday afternoon at 2:00 pm, the China Book Company held a regular shareholders' meeting at the Bank of China to discuss the revaluation and capital increase, amendments to the articles of association, and the re-election of directors and supervisors. Because this shareholders' meeting was the company's first regular meeting after the war, there was an unusually large number of attendees and shares. By 2:30 pm, the reported shares had reached more than two-thirds. The meeting began at 3:00 pm, and the shareholders unanimously elected Du Yuesheng as the temporary chairman. General Manager Li Shuming reported on the company's progress over the past ten years, and then the proposals and amendments to the articles of association were discussed and passed. The company's revaluation and capital increase this time is 10 billion yuan. The dividends for previous terms have reached 2 billion, so the 11% cash that should be paid according to the revaluation and capital increase method can also be transferred from the previous dividends, that is, each share can get 1,250 shares without paying cash. The company also has preferential coupons and gifts for the shareholders, so all the shareholders were very happy. The election of directors and supervisors has not yet been counted, but according to the rough estimate of the vote counters, the old directors and supervisors are generally re-elected. The votes for the newly added directors are mostly cast for Du Yuesheng, Xu Shihao, Lu Fei Mingzhong, Wu Shutong, Li Changyun, Chen and Wu Mingran.</p>
<h3>Small News from the Cultural Circles</h3>
<p>According to people from Hong Kong: Guo Moruo is writing articles in Hong Kong attacking the domestic cultural circles, classifying the domestic cultural circles as pink, yellow, blue, white, and black.

<h3>Offering Ten Thousand Yuan Bribe; The Crime Is the Same Regardless of the Amount; Old Quartermaster Indicted</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The case of offering a 10,000 yuan bribe was recently filed by the District Procuratorate. The defendant, Chen Yongsheng, is an old quartermaster at the Dafeng Dyeing and Weaving Factory. On the morning of the 27th of last month, when he was supervising the unloading of goods from the factory's truck at Wufu Lane on Ningbo Road, he was seen by police officer No. 2252, who believed that the narrow road and the parking were obstructing traffic and took measures to stop it. Unexpectedly, Chen solemnly took out 10,000 yuan from his pocket to offer a bribe to avoid the penalty. The police officer believed that 10,000 yuan could only buy two sesame cakes, which was an intentional insult, so he took Chen to the police station, and then transferred him to the District Procuratorate for investigation. After investigation by the prosecutor, because the amount of the bribe was small, but the crime was the same, he was indicted for the crime of Article 122, Paragraph 3 of the Criminal Law.</p>

<h3>General Chennault Discusses US Policy Toward China</h3>
<p>Copyright, Scripps-Howard Newspaper Alliance. Translated by our Newspaper Translation Department.</p>
<p>(2) Two Interlocking Characteristics</p>
<p>The political and military situation in China today has been largely caused by the official encouragement of the Chinese Communists and the obstruction of the Chinese Central Government by the United States.</p>
<p>During the four years of our wartime alliance with the Chinese Central Government, this phenomenon blossomed like a strange flower in the middle of the war and has been blooming ever since—too long, I think.</p>
<p>Our encouragement of armed rebellion against a universally recognized government, and our carping campaign against that government, are equally peculiar interlocking factors. This carping campaign started with helpful criticism and turned into outright slander.</p>
<p>These two interlocking characteristics of our policy clearly meet the wishes of the Communist fellow travelers, even if it is not the result of their activities in wartime Chongqing and elsewhere.</p>
<p>To what extent our policy was directly confused by fellow travelers, I cannot say now. Since I am more concerned with the results than with the motives, I consider this a theoretical question anyway. In fact, the success expected by the destroyers of Sino-American cooperation has been greater than they themselves could have achieved. American officials who have fulfilled this expectation have been tools of the fellow travelers.</p>
<p>I am not saying that responsible American officials were deliberately playing Communist tricks in Chongqing, but I do accuse them of falling into the Communist trap, and by doing so, they have harmed our cooperation with the Chinese Central Government during the critical stage of the war and almost permanently.</p>
<p>Regarding the wartime and post-war US policy toward the tendency of compromise and appeasement with the Chinese Communists, I can only write this way - regarding the goal of appeasing the Chinese Communists, it is now happily denied by President Truman and Secretary of State Marshall, although this was only heard recently.</p>
<p>On the one hand, speaking ill of the Central Government behind its back, and on the other hand, patting the Communists on the back, this two-pronged trick has met and helped to promote the political crisis in Free China in 1944. If it had not been for Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek's expulsion of General Stilwell at that time, this crisis would almost certainly have ended in destroying the Sino-American joint efforts at that time.</p>
<p>We will now discuss the two situations of the American policy at that time one by one the spectacle of American officials being unsympathetic to wartime allies, and the mutual factors of our "openly talking about love" with the Chinese Reds.</p>
<p>Before General Wedemeyer replaced General Stilwell in 1944, the staff consultations between the US and the Chinese government almost continued to be excessive pressure and intimidation. In fact, this only symbolized the low estimation of a Chinese leader by Stilwell and his staff, and this leader had been resisting Japan for four years before the Pearl Harbor Incident.</p>
<p>At that time, the similarities between our military and diplomatic relations with China were obvious, even if the military aspect was not so peculiar. In this memoir, I am more prepared to directly discuss the latter.</p>
<p>American leaders seem unable to get along with the Chinese people on the basis of mutual understanding, mutual assistance, and mutual respect. "A Chinese soldier, if given proper training, equipment, and supplies, is able to fight" - this view, said again and again, is the greatest sign that Stilwell and his subordinates can express their confidence in the Chinese people.</p>
<p>This unhelpful statement has confused many American war correspondents and seems to have made Stilwell the benefactor of China. In fact, this statement has underestimated the potential of China and is almost a slander.</p>
<p>As if it were a planned scheme, the American evaluation of the Chinese Central Government and its affiliated institutions (including the military) has become the talk of the town wherever Americans gather. On the one hand, American soldiers elsewhere are ordered to avoid talking about the Chinese government, but on the other hand, the American military officers in Chongqing are constantly reciting the actual or imaginary shortcomings of the Chinese government without any slack, and have become an approved habit.</p>
<p>Even if what they said was true, these incantations have gone beyond the scope of ordinary arbitrary speech, not to mention that it is not true, so this is enough to show the depth and magnitude of their imprudence and thoughtlessness.</p>
<p>Frequent contact between headquarters personnel and American war correspondents (mostly informal) has increased this mass production of criticism of China. Not only the American military, but also the reporters, are guests of the Chinese government in China, and they seem to care little about the fact that this government is often criticized.</p>
<p>My air force headquarters was in Kunming, but I often went to the war zone headquarters in Chongqing. Every time I went to Chongqing, if I wanted to listen, I could always hear the echo of this movement. This cannot be regarded as a whispering movement it is too loud.</p>
<p>Stilwell never met with American reporters in Chongqing, but his disrespectful opinions were always provided to reporters in private talks or news conferences under the name of "not for publication." From a reporter who arrived in Chongqing at the end of 1943, I got an example. In a "not for publication" talk, he asked Stilwell what China needed most at that time to continue fighting.</p>
<p>To this question, Stilwell simply replied: "Carefully select a hundred heads and kill them all."</p>
<p>General Stilwell's low estimation of Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek is often revealed. I remember one of the most important examples.</p>
<p>In the spring of 1943, President Roosevelt convened a joint chiefs of staff meeting in Washington, and I was ordered to attend. Churchill was also present. President Roosevelt asked Stilwell to give an overview of the Chinese situation. Stilwell stood up and violently criticized Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek, saying that the Generalissimo was unreliable, ungrateful, insincere, and unfaithful. Mr. Roosevelt interrupted his speech and asked, "Chennault, what do you think of this?" I stood up and told them that in all the years I have stayed in China, the Generalissimo has never broken faith with me in any way. I think he is a great man and the only leader who can unite China."</p>
<p>This time, General Stilwell's and my comments were both recorded in the White House records.</p>
<h3>Xing'an Ship - Commissioning Announcement</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 26th] American labor is expensive. Under the slogan of "more work, more pay," the efficiency of contract workers, whose two days' wages equal a month's salary for our commissioning soldiers, is highly suspect, and the achievements of the contractors are even more difficult to mention. The "Xing'an" ship departed from the Port of New Orleans on November 7th. After about a week, it passed through the Panama Canal and discovered a crack in the left main engine, leaking more than 900 gallons of water per day. With no other choice, they had to pump water while sailing. Approaching Christmas, they welded and repaired it in San Francisco for two weeks, but after only a day and night of sailing, it leaked again. They sailed back to San Francisco for further repairs and continued sailing. However, the aging engine should have been overhauled long ago. In less than three days, the left main engine continued to leak. The Americans knew they could no longer cope with it and finally performed a major overhaul in Pearl Harbor, staying for forty days, replacing a jacket for the left main engine. They left Pearl Harbor on February 18th this year, passing through Yokosuka and sailing back to the homeland.</p>
<p>The "Xing'an" ship has a full load displacement of 3,919 tons, a length of 328 feet, and a width of 50 feet. Painted in silver-gray, it majestically docks on the Yangtze River. Standing on it, apart from the uneven and scarred deck, it is hard to imagine its previous dilapidated appearance, but the repair process described above is entirely true. When General Gui Yongqing received the thick commissioning report from Captain Xu, he undoubtedly also accepted the various hardships and pains experienced by the ninety-nine officers and soldiers over the past nine months. At the same time, for the Chinese new navy gaining another new piece, he expressed his heartfelt congratulations on their outstanding achievements.</p>
<p>Returning Home - Welcomed Everywhere</p>
<p>On the return journey of the "Xing'an" ship, departing from New Orleans, it passed through Havana (Habna), the capital of Cuba, Colon and Balboa in the Panama Canal Zone, Acapulco in Mexico, San Francisco and Pearl Harbor in the United States, and Yokosuka in Japan, totaling several ports. Although the overseas Chinese were not notified in advance because it was not an official visit, the welcome they received was still grand and enthusiastic. Most of the commissioning officers were veterans of the Taikang and other eight ships from thirty-five years ago. The situation from two years ago unfolded again before their eyes. Overseas compatriots everywhere, upon discovering warships flying the national flag of their motherland berthed in the harbor, would automatically row sampans to board the ships for visits, in an endless stream, lingering and forgetting to return. The guest signature book on the ship already had the names of thousands of overseas Chinese.</p>
<p>Overseas Chinese, relying on their strong vitality in various places, mostly started from scratch and lived frugally, but when warships from their motherland visited their residences, they spared no expense to hold grand welcome meetings, even filming movies for remembrance. This fully demonstrates their sincere love for their motherland. Warships from their motherland brought them warmth and pride. They rarely have the opportunity to return home, so boarding warships flying the flag of the Blue Sky, White Sun, and Red Earth felt like stepping onto their homeland. Therefore, they are grateful to the Chinese Navy and cherish the Chinese Navy. This time, the officers of the "Xing'an" ship were often asked by overseas Chinese about the rumors of smuggling by the Taikang and other eight ships from the previous year. When they learned that the rumors were completely unfounded, that the slandered officers were innocent, and that they were still serving honorably in the Navy, they breathed a sigh of relief. Therefore, when it comes to those unfounded and malicious rumors, Captain Xu believes:</p>
<p>"This is not just a matter of the integrity of one or two naval officers or one or two warships; it concerns the honor and disgrace of the entire nation."</p>
<p>When the "Xing'an" ship approached the homeland, our customs notified the Naval Headquarters, saying: "According to reports, the Xing'an warship is carrying a large number of smuggled goods from the United States. Please pay close attention to the inspection." General Gui Yongqing ordered the "Xing'an" ship to sail directly to Nanjing and anchor in the center of the Yangtze River off Xiaguan. It was not allowed to dock until he had inspected it. As a result, the "Xing'an" ship was completely innocent.</p>
<p>An Inspiration: People Must Help Themselves</p>
<p>The "Xing'an" ship is only a small part of American aid, but in the context of the current trend of American aid to China, the acquisition, repair, and use of the "Xing'an" ship precisely reveals an unshakeable truth:</p>
<p>"People must help themselves!"</p>
<p>The "Xing'an" ship is just a medium-sized or smaller old tank landing ship that the US Navy had already decommissioned, with crude construction, but it is still very useful to us. The machine tools in the repair bay on the ship, including drilling machines, iron beds, planers, and welding equipment, are more than capable of repairing ordinary ships. This asset is also quite considerable in terms of value. The United States, based on a single agreement, generously donated a total of 271 ships, large and small, new and old, similar to it to us. In any case, it is a great act of kindness and friendship. Therefore, even if the "Xing'an" ship is more dilapidated, the Chinese cannot say there is anything that shouldn't be. Adding an adjective to the donated ships in the Sino-US Naval Agreement, that is, handing over the ships in the condition and location they were in at the time of signing the agreement, perhaps some broken ships would have already sunk to the bottom of the sea before they could be received, and we could dispose of them however we pleased.</p>
<p>When the "Xing'an" ship was being repaired in the Port of New Orleans, the US Navy provided assistance in terms of repair, supply, and navigation. Captain Xu specifically expressed his gratitude during a press conference. But in fact, the Americans always believed that the poor Chinese Navy had too high expectations for this broken ship, and their coldness seemed to outweigh their enthusiasm. Borrowing tools and adding equipment encountered difficulties that were truly indescribable. At the same time, it coincided with General Wedemeyer's visit to China as a special envoy to investigate. Although a small part of American public opinion advocated aid to China, the majority still opposed it. The conservative southern states of the United States severely criticized the federal government's aid measures, not only believing that lending money to China was completely giving it to corrupt officials to squander, but also that donating old and dilapidated warships with little prospect of being of much use to the Chinese government was a waste. Under these circumstances, in order to accomplish the mission, the commissioning personnel, in addition to overcoming the shortage of tools and equipment and the various hardships that only Chinese workers could endure, also had to endure mental oppression. Accepting aid itself was a heavy burden on the motherland.</p>
<p>The acquisition, repair, and use of a "Xing'an" ship were so difficult. Thanks to the dedication and efforts of the ninety-nine commissioning officers and soldiers of our new navy, they were able to turn decay into magic, transforming the dilapidated fuel tank into a floating repair factory that could better help other ships. This fact solemnly shows us that "If you don't help yourself, others can't help you."</p>
<h3>Changzhou Military, Police, and Gendarmerie Conduct Surprise Household Checks</h3>
<p>[Our Wujin Dispatch, 27th] The local security agencies mobilized over a thousand armed personnel, together with town and village chiefs, to conduct surprise household checks throughout the city in groups after curfew on the night of the 26th.

All were sent to the city defense department. For a time, visitors to the city defense department came in an endless stream. The military court interrogated them one by one, dealt with them according to the circumstances, and released them separately. The interrogation is currently ongoing. The troops acted strictly and justly during this surprise check, and the public had a very good impression.</p>

<h3>Fengxian Exposes and Bans Usurious Grain Loans</h3>
<p>[Our Fengxian Dispatch, 26th] Farmers in the Touqiao Town area of Wuhua Township in this county have no choice but to resort to loans to maintain farming and daily life. Some unscrupulous people take the opportunity to exploit them by issuing usurious grain loans. For example, borrowing one stone of grain for a period of four months requires the return of two stones of grain. Moreover, when borrowing, the inferior indica rice is only 150 catties, but when returning, it must be 160 catties of superior japonica rice, and it must be clearly stated on the loan note. Farmers are drinking poison to quench their thirst and have no other choice. It is said that there are many people in the town who engage in this business. Now, it has been discovered by people from the town living abroad, who have collected the facts and reported the names to the relevant authorities in this county, requesting strict bans to benefit the rural areas. The authorities are currently dispatching personnel to secretly investigate in order to gather evidence for handling the matter.</p>

The police局 arrested two suspects in the case, Qin Deyu and Mr. Yang, who have been sent to the court for interrogation. On the same night that the case occurred, an assassination also took place in Dongguan. Zhang Aichen, who had served as the head of Xiangshan Township, was avoiding bandits and living with his family in the Cai Garden in Dongguan. That night, Zhang and his wife had a quarrel and only went to bed late at night. Suddenly, four bandits in military uniforms broke into Zhang's room, shone a flashlight, and shot Zhang several times in a row. Zhang rolled away to avoid the shots and was injured in the left rib. His wife raised her own pistol and fired back, killing one bandit in the head. The remaining bandits fled.</p>

<h3>Bandits Attack Yuci Border Area</h3>
<p>[Our Yuyao Dispatch, 26th] In the town of Lubu, at the border of Yu (Yao) and Ci (Xi), suddenly at around 11 o'clock last night (25th), a large number of bandits, more than 200 in total, wearing gray uniforms and carrying various weapons, first searched the original residence of the Zhejiang Security Team, the Dazhuang Temple in Lubu, and then fled to the Lubu Township Office (belonging to Cixi), burning all documents and equipment, and looting a telephone switchboard. They also kidnapped Zhang Jilin, a plainclothes officer of the Zhejiang Security Team stationed in Lubu, resident Zhang Jipin, as well as the town team deputy and a telephone operator. In the direction of Zhuangqi Mountain, the bandits stabbed the plainclothes officer Zhang Jilin to death with a sharp knife. The telephone operator and the town team deputy were released on the 26th.

<h3>Divine Lottery as Ballot - Yao Zhaosheng Lucky to Get the "Most Auspicious" Lottery - People's Representatives Ask for Re-election</h3>
<p>[Our Jiangyin Dispatch, 27th] Zou Zongyi, a senator of Zhongzheng Township, left his post to study in the United States. The vacancy was filled by the county government sending personnel to the township to supervise the election. Yao Zhaosheng and Yu Kuifang each received four votes, making it difficult to decide. Finally, the person in charge came up with a strange idea, taking a divine lottery that the people prayed for in the temple. The lottery was drawn with "most auspicious" being elected and "least auspicious" being eliminated. As a result of the lottery, Yao Zhaosheng got the "most auspicious" lottery.

<h3>True Beauty and Good Education and Modern Youth: In Celebration of the 37th Youth Day</h3>
<p>— Gu Yuxiu</p>
<p>When a culture reaches its completion, society lacks imagination. Rigidity, repetition, and a decline in brilliant appreciation gradually emerge, with everything conforming to convention. Orthodox schools suppress "adventure."</p>
<p>In this transformation of culture, how can we reverse its decline? Professor Whitehead solemnly warned in advance: "Only when thought runs ahead of facts can the transformation of a new culture arrive quickly. National vitality advances to the adventure of imagination, and can anticipate practical adventures. Humanity dreams of the world to come, and perhaps it will be realized in time."</p>
<p>Culture (or civilization) represents an ideal of life, which is related to the individual and also to the group (human society). For the past six centuries, European culture has followed in the footsteps of its predecessors. The golden ages of Greece and Rome have been the standards of civilization. The present world is advancing towards a new stage of existence. New knowledge and new technologies have changed the proportions of things. The ideals particular to ancient society were too "static," neglecting the opportunities of the entire series. It is not enough to pay attention only to the best famous sayings and greatest successes of ancient times. The result of imitating the ancients is stagnation, repression, and a psychological habit of decline. In fact, the Greeks of that time were not static. Compared to their contemporaries, they did not worship history. They imagined, they adventured, they loved novelty. If we were to do something most contrary to the spirit of the Greeks, it would be to copy everything Greek. The ancient Greeks were never copyists.</p>
<p>From sociological research or an understanding of life, we must note: Perfection is impossible to maintain through stasis. Advancement or decay is the only path available to humanity.</p>
<p>Culture (or civilization), according to the modern great scholar Professor Whitehead—who may be the greatest philosopher of this era, who passed away on December 30th of last year—in the fourth part of his book "Adventures of Ideas," includes "Truth," "Beauty," "Adventure," "Art," and "Peace." "Truth" is the consistency between "Appearance" and "Reality." "Beauty" is the completion of "Harmony," and harmony is the completion of the "Subjective Form" in its detail and synthesis. The subjective form must have "Strength"; there are two conditions for strength: massiveness and intensity. Destruction also has intense emotions, but it violates the principles of harmony. The concept of "Beauty" is broader than that of "Truth," but "Truth" can promote beauty. "Good" and "Evil" are not the purpose of art; they are only related to worldly affairs. When the world is beautiful, it is also good. Science and art are intentional pursuits of "Truth" and "Beauty."</p>
<p>Looking at the sages throughout history, they all pursued a complete life of truth, goodness, and beauty. They are the best examples of education in truth, goodness, and beauty. They not only had abundant knowledge but also transcendent wisdom. They not only established themselves but also established others; they not only saved people but also saved the world; they not only strived for social justice but also sought the common good of the world; they not only served the masses but also sought the great unity of mankind. "To hear the Tao in the morning, and to die in the evening, one is content," is to advance to a realm beyond the ordinary and enter the realm of sainthood. Whether it is truth, morality, or art, the extreme of beauty is holiness, and there is no holiness that is not beautiful. Supreme holiness is supreme beauty, and it possesses supreme emotion. Supreme beauty creates the solemnity of the universe, and supreme emotion gives rise to human universal love.</p>
<p>Modern youth should shoulder the important responsibility of reversing cultural decline, and education in truth, beauty, and goodness is a great force for saving the world from declining trends.</p>

<h3>General Prices: Reduced Inflow of Speculative Capital Slows Price Inflation</h3>
<p>The dramatic price fluctuations after the Lunar New Year reached their peak in the second week of this month, that is, three weeks ago. In that week, the general index seen in the wholesale price index compiled by this association rose by 28.6% compared to the previous week. Among the classified indexes, food, textiles, and building materials all rose by more than 32%. In the previous week and last week, the inflationary trend gradually slowed down. The general price index rose by 6% in the previous week. Among the classified indexes, chemical products, which are mostly imported goods, rose more, perhaps due to the special impact of foreign exchange adjustments, but it was still only 28.8%. Last week, the general index rose by only 4.4%. Among the classified indexes, building materials and metals rose faster, while food and textiles, which are more closely related to people's livelihoods, rose less.</p>
<p>There are many reasons for the slowdown in price inflation in the past two weeks. The more important ones are as follows: First, the soaring prices in Shanghai after the Lunar New Year resulted in a gap that was too large compared to the interior. As a result, a large amount of speculative capital flowed from Shanghai to the interior, especially to Chongqing, Chengdu, and Kunming, causing the soaring prices in various places in Chongqing and Kunming in the past two weeks, while Shanghai felt a shortage of funds in the market due to the outflow of speculative capital in the short term. Second, the recent reversal of the war situation in Northeast and North China has promoted a large outflow of industrial equipment and market funds from Shanghai to the south. The southward escape of funds can be seen from the recent increase in exchange rates in various parts of South China. This point naturally has an important relationship with the tightening of funds in this city. Third, speculative capital from Northeast and North China often flows into this city through the method of travelers from the above-mentioned places carrying cash to Shanghai. Recently, due to the increasingly intense war situation in the above-mentioned places, traffic has been blocked, and the number of ships coming south has decreased in the past two weeks, so there is one less source of speculative capital in this city. Fourth, the government recently decided to forcibly collect special relief donations, which has a stimulus effect on wealthy households with fixed assets and hoarding goods. Because fixed assets and hoarding goods are easily inspected, many are sold to exchange for financial items that are easy to hide. This point has a considerable impact on the increase in the supply of goods in the market. Fifth, the dramatic price fluctuations after the Lunar New Year naturally increased the amount of chips required for transactions, thus relatively making funds feel tight.</p>
<p>As a result of the combination of the above various reasons, funds continued the general trend of the previous week and felt tight last week, only slightly turning gentle at the weekend. This point is quite similar to the change in the tightness of funds in the previous week. Funds were tighter at the beginning of last week, and prices generally fell compared to the end of the previous week, especially textiles. The prices of some goods reached their lowest on Wednesday and Thursday. For example, 20-count Double Horse yarn was as low as 100 million yuan per piece, and 42-count Blue Phoenix was as low as 170 million. White japonica rice was as low as 3.6 million per stone. However, near the weekend, funds loosened, and prices rose again. 42-count Blue Phoenix reached 210 million again on Saturday. 20-count Double Horse was as high as 126 million. Longtou fine cloth rose even faster, returning to the peak of 4.4 million. White japonica wheat flour was no higher than in the previous weeks. Among fuels, the source of coal was more abundant and the season had passed. Among chemical products, such as 693 vulcanized yuan, the price was relatively stable due to seasonal reasons. The former, such as Jiaozuo lump coal, stabilized at 14 million per ton, and the latter, such as vulcanized yuan, stabilized at 52 million per barrel, with very little fluctuation, which are a small number of more special goods among all goods.</p>

<h3>Currency and Finance</h3>
<p>(1) Informal Interest Rates</p>
<p>Generally speaking, funds in this city were extremely tight last week. Businesses lacking funds were forced to sell in order to raise funds, resulting in generally weak prices and high informal interest rates. Cash chips were extremely scarce in the first half of the week due to more outflow than inflow. On Monday, bills were not cleared until 1:00 AM, which shows the tightness of funds. However, after Wednesday, first, foreign speculative funds continued to arrive, and second, the exchange difference between the national banks and bureaus turned from inflow to outflow after deducting the fixed deposits of commercial banks, which increased the supply of chips in the market, and interbank lending also became more flexible. The tight situation of funds slightly eased, and although a glimmer of hope was revealed for the return of tightness to looseness in the second half of the week, the large-scale advance of national banks and bureaus did not lead to a sharp decline in prices, so funds were still generally in demand, and the interest rates for securities intermediaries were even as high as 40% or more.</p>
<p>On Monday and Tuesday of last week, the actual inflow of funds from national banks and bureaus was more than 200 billion. After Wednesday, it turned into an outflow. The actual outflow on Friday reached 218.3 billion, setting the highest record for the outflow of national banks and bureaus in half a month.</p>
<p>The amount of difference inflow from foreign banks can also be said to be unprecedented. In the five days from Monday to Friday, the total difference inflow was 640 billion, with an average daily difference inflow of more than 100 billion. Among them, in addition to a part of the funds being recovered from interbank lending, the surging southward flow of speculative capital is also noteworthy.</p>
<p>The shortage of funds in commercial banks and firms has been quite common this week. The difference outflow of banks and firms after the 60th account was nearly 2 trillion in the five days from Monday to Friday, with an average daily outflow of more than 300 billion. The number of commercial banks turning in cash to the Central Bank to offset orders was very small this week, with an average of only 40-50 billion per day. The scarcity of cash chips can be seen from this.</p>
<p>Informal interest rates maintained a high level throughout last week and did not fall. The lowest was 33%, 34.5% was the most common, and 36% was the highest. Securities arbitrage was as high as 45%, while the general rate was around 40%. The interest rate for securities intermediaries was stable at a permanent level of 36%.</p>
<p>(2) Domestic and Foreign Exchange Rates</p>
<p>The benchmark rate for foreign exchange transactions remained unchanged last week. The exchange rate was 255,000 yuan, and the pound arbitrage rate was 765,000 yuan. The Hong Kong exchange rate was flat and weak in the first half of the week, maintaining between 1.023 yuan per Hong Kong dollar. It lengthened to 1.27 yuan on Thursday, and slightly shrank on Friday.</p>
<p>Domestic exchange rates of commercial banks in this city generally decreased last week. The Guangzhou exchange rate was 300 yuan per thousand yuan on Monday, and it has fallen to 120 yuan on Friday. The trend of the Xiamen exchange rate was also the same. It was 300 yuan on Monday, fell to 200 yuan on Tuesday, and then fell to 180 yuan on Friday. The Chongqing exchange rate was the highest at 30 yuan per thousand yuan on Monday and Wednesday, and it had fallen to 10 yuan on Friday. Although the Wuhan exchange rate once rose from 110 yuan on Monday to 200 yuan on Tuesday, it has since declined repeatedly and fell to 100 yuan on Friday. The Tianjin discount increased alone. It was 30 yuan per thousand yuan discount on Monday and had increased to 50 yuan on Friday, indicating the trend of funds flowing in from the north.</p>
<p>(3) Chinese and Foreign Stock Markets</p>
<p>Before Thursday of last week, the stock market generally showed a consistent downward trend. In the financial world, on the one hand, it was stimulated by the prospect of the US loan being passed. On the other hand, the funds in the market were extremely tight. Although many optimistic people believed that the agricultural loan issuance and industrial loan success were imminent, and that funds would soon loosen, this optimistic atmosphere ultimately could not withstand the shortness of the available chips. Therefore, under helplessness, many had to sell and exchange for funds. Retail investors in the market were also willing to participate in arbitrage in order to receive interest of 40% or more. With more supply than demand, the stock market naturally declined. However, this phenomenon was still short-lived. The trend of funds had already eased in the second half of the week. Whether the release of agricultural loans could avoid becoming speculative capital was quite questionable. In addition, the settlement period for the second phase of short-term treasury bills had arrived. Therefore, the stock market would return to its good path after Friday. Chinese stocks, such as Yongsheng, opened at 1860 yuan on Monday. By the morning session on Thursday, it had fallen to 1650 yuan. During the same period, the difference between the prices of Xinguang was 246 and 222, the difference between the prices of Jingfu was 244 and 221, and the difference between the prices of Xinyi was 300 and 220. However, the market turned from weak to strong in the afternoon of Thursday. In the afternoon session of Friday, the spot price of Yongsheng had returned to the over-1700 yuan price. The closing prices of Xinguang, Jingfu, and other stocks in the afternoon of Friday were not far from the closing prices on Monday. It seems that this situation will continue for a period of time!</p>
<p>The buying price of foreign stocks such as Huayi yarn was 1.93 million on Monday morning, but it had fallen to 1.65 million on Thursday afternoon. Jardine Matheson fell from 5 million to 4.2 million during the same period. British-American Tobacco was 2.69 million on Monday, but it was only 2.3 million on Thursday afternoon. However, like Chinese stocks, it returned to a high price on Friday. Huayi yarn reached 1.81 million in the afternoon, British-American Tobacco 2.48 million, and Jardine Matheson rose to 4.75 million, seemingly catching up with its buying price at the beginning of the week. The easing of funds and the tightening of the Hong Kong exchange rate had a great impact.</p>
<h3>Business &amp; Industry Trends</h3>
<p>Import "Relaxation" or "Restriction"</p>
<p>Regarding the import of raw materials for export products, the Export Control Board (輸管會) convened relevant industries starting from the 3rd of last month for daily consultations. A total of 32 industries were summoned, and the meetings concluded on the 20th of this month. It is understood that for the manufacturing raw materials needed by most manufacturers for export, applications can now be submitted according to import procedures. If the total value of the manufacturing raw materials requested for import does not exceed 40% of the total value of their finished product exports, it can be approved in advance. However, a condition is attached that manufacturers must settle the full amount of the total export value with designated banks when purchasing import foreign exchange. This shows that the government's ultimate goal is still to further obtain foreign exchange reserves. As for industries unrelated to foreign exchange earnings, whether their raw material quotas are sufficient, or even not allocated at all, the authorities often pay little attention. This has led to the Shanghai Oils Association (油脂公會) and the Guolian Kerosene Factory (國煉火油廠) making accusatory appeals due to the insufficient allocation of diesel fuel for refining kerosene. Last Tuesday, the Association hosted the press, criticizing the Export Control Board for neglecting the fact that diesel fuel is essential for kerosene refining, and stated that since Guolian Kerosene relies entirely on diesel fuel as raw material, and diesel fuel is managed and controlled by the Export Control Board, the failure to approve allocation contradicts the Ministry of Economic Affairs' stated policy of support. In addition to this, last week, the enamelware industry also appealed for increased quotas and reduced prices for raw materials to maintain production. In short, the authorities are now suppressing so-called unnecessary imports, which in reality are imports that cannot generate more foreign exchange. For imported materials essential for people's livelihoods and industries, they are trying every possible means to use control mechanisms to grasp these materials or the commodities made from them. To achieve this goal, the Ministry of Economic Affairs recently tasked the Industrial and Commercial Counseling Department (工商輔導處) with formulating an opinion on how to control industrial product prices. The proposed opinion believes that to control the price of finished products, a general material warehouse should be established, with the government centrally purchasing necessary raw materials domestically and abroad, to be allocated to various private industrial factories. Then, through order-based loans, physical objects would be loaned, and finished products purchased. In this way, the government can also control a batch of materials through centralized raw material purchases.</p>
<p>Under the two principles of requiring a guarantee from a designated bank for exporters and applicants to settle 40% of the total export value in advance, the import of manufacturing raw materials for export products has begun to be applied for and reviewed. The International Trade Promotion Association (國際貿易促進會) is preparing for further plans. Last Wednesday, the Association held a symposium and planned to draft a letter to the Export Control Board, requesting that general export goods such as raw materials and agricultural by-products also be handled with preferential treatment according to the industrial product raw material import method. However, according to reports, the authorities believe that although the request for agricultural products to be handled according to the industrial product raw material import method is reasonable, the current government situation does not allow it. The key issue is obviously whether subsidizing the export of agricultural products can generate sufficient foreign exchange. Moreover, the government's soon-to-be-implemented method of purchasing seven export commodities is already sufficient to solve this problem—obtaining foreign exchange!</p>
<p>Another example of import restrictions is the method of restricting the import of chemical products passed by the National Economic Council (全經會) last Thursday. The original proposal was that the import quota of chemical raw materials would be approved according to the examination opinion, that is, in principle, 19 categories that can be self-produced will not be included, and 9 categories that can be gradually manufactured will be reclassified into Appendix 3 (A) and their import volume will be reduced.</p>
<p>The "Luck" and "Misfortune" of Production Loans</p>
<p>Regarding the quantity and allocation of this year's production loans, this newspaper has provided many comprehensive reports in previous issues. This column pointed out in the last issue that among all loans, agricultural loans are the most favored, with grain production loans totaling 5 trillion and cotton production loans totaling 3 trillion, accounting for more than half of the total loan amount. The purpose of this huge amount of agricultural loans, in addition to the so-called increase in production, is probably to control agricultural product materials. For example, at the Farmers Bank of China (農民銀行) administrative meeting, in addition to deciding that the total loan amount for this month would be 1,475 billion, it was further stipulated that fertilizer and seeds would be loaned in kind, and the rest would be loaned in cash in principle. In addition, it is said that to take charge of the materials on behalf of the government, agricultural warehouses will be established in grain and cotton production areas to handle the storage and mortgage of agricultural products. According to the person in charge of the Central Cooperative Treasury (中央合作金庫), the 3 trillion agricultural loans allocated to the Treasury will still follow the guidelines approved by the United Office of the Four Banks (四聯總處), focusing on grain and cotton, and fertilizers, silk, and water conservancy will all be loaned in kind. For fertilizers and silk, it is also planned to recover the physical objects. Fertilizers will be loaned with bean cakes and rice will be recovered. Silk will be loaned seeds first, and in the future, 60% will be recovered in kind and 40% in cash. It can be seen that a large part of these 60% of loans will be recovered in kind in the future. Such a subtle and complex lending process is indeed, as the general manager of the China Farmers Bank (中農) said in his written statement on this year's agricultural loan policy, "easily criticized." At the same time, except for a few people, probably everyone hopes that this agricultural loan can indeed, as Mr. Li declared, "reach individual farmers through farmers' organizations, and cannot be like urban capital, having an adverse impact on prices!"</p>
<p>Although agricultural loans have already been settled, the detailed rules for export loans are still under discussion. According to the Import and Export Association (進出會), first, the government stipulates that the loan amount is based on the past export volume, but the government is now planning to expand my country's export trade, and the loan amount is based on the past export volume, which inevitably limits the expansion of exporters' business. Second, the loan amount is settled once a month, and it is stipulated that one-tenth of the loan amount is settled monthly, which lacks flexibility and cannot match the seasonality of export commodity sales, so it is hoped that the authorities will revise it.</p>
<p>The opening of export channels has indeed shown some promise, but whether industrial loans will be opened is still without news. According to a spokesperson for the Industrial Association (工協), since the end of last year, factories in various industries, except for the textile industry, have been increasingly entering a difficult situation. According to his estimation, about 30% of factories are in a state of shutdown for various reasons, resulting in a decrease of about 40% in the production of general daily necessities compared to the past, which is also one of the reasons for the soaring prices.</p>
<p>Japan's Revival is China's Mortal Enemy</p>
<p>While most of the people in our country are still struggling on the brink of starvation, a large amount of soybeans will be shipped to Japan to relieve the Japanese famine. According to a special dispatch from the Central News Agency (中央社) in Tokyo on the 22nd, two Chinese ships carrying 32,000 tons of soybeans, bean cakes, and peanuts are scheduled to depart from Central and North China for Japan recently. Among them, one will carry 14,000 tons of miscellaneous grains (mostly purchased from Hankou) from Shanghai to Japan, and the other will carry 18,000 tons of soybeans from Northeast China from Tianjin to Japan. This coincides with the news reported by the same agency on the 23rd that under the US policy, an agricultural China and an industrial Japan are being formed again. It is said that the United States may provide Japan with loans totaling 765 million US dollars in July when the next fiscal year begins. It is also learned that the United States is currently considering a plan to restore the Japanese economy to the level of 1934, and the production target for 1948 is set to reach 36 million tons of coal and 1 million tons of steel. Therefore, it is no wonder that Kazuo Ishikawa, chairman of the joint meeting of important Japanese banks, and Kiichiro Sato, vice chairman of the Federation of Industrial Organizations, have dared to express the opinion that they will be able to get rid of foreign capitalists' control over Japanese industry in the future.</p>
<p>That post-war Japan will once again pose a threat to our country can not only be seen in MacArthur's policies, but also in Japan's recent inroads into the international market. According to a magnate in the export industry, when talking about the current situation of the Aden cloth market, Japan has entered the international trade stage, and it is inevitable that it will dump a large amount of cloth to the Near East in the future. According to a telegram from Xinhua News Agency (新亞社) in Tokyo on the 22nd, the export of silk fabrics, which account for a large proportion of textiles, has gradually increased in January, February, and March. So far, the most export destinations are New York, followed by Honolulu. Recently, 31,653 pieces have also been exported to Singapore. According to unofficial statistics, the amount of Japanese goods shipped to Hong Kong in the past six months is more than to any other place, and the ratio compared with Singapore is 30 to 1. Of this huge amount of Japanese goods imported, Hong Kong sells only about 80%, and the rest is transshipped to various parts of Southeast Asia. Yuan Liang, chairman of the Yarn Control Board (紗管會), also pointed out when meeting with reporters last Wednesday that in a month, Japanese cloth will be massively dumped in Southeast Asia. It can be seen that the situation is already serious enough.</p>
<h3>Steel Industry's Perspective in the Northern Flames of War</h3>
<p>The production of iron ore in our country reaches a huge amount of 2,257,000 tons annually in the Northeast, and the total of other provinces is less than half of it. Before the war, 90% of the iron ore produced was exported to Japan. Steelmaking with iron is also centered in the Northeast, especially the Anshan Iron and Steel Company (鞍山鋼鐵公司) in the Northeast, which has the largest scale. Before the war, the annual steel production was 530,000 tons. During the occupation, the Japanese stepped up production and exceeded one million tons. Its equipment, such as the 400-ton smelting furnace, the 100-ton open-hearth steelmaking furnace, and all the steel rolling equipment, are extremely valuable. In contrast, the steel production of other provinces is quite poor, and the statistics that can be obtained are as follows:</p>
<p>(Unit: tons)</p>
<p>Hubei 216,000</p>
<p>Anhui 120,000</p>
<p>Hunan 240,000</p>
<p>Shanxi 32,000</p>
<p>Guangdong 80,000</p>
<p>Sichuan 108,000</p>
<p>Guizhou 120,000</p>
<p>Yunnan 56,000</p>
<p>The total is less than one million tons. Now that Anshan has been lost, we can only strengthen the construction of poor areas. Therefore, Central and South China have regained favor. The Qijiang Electrochemical Smelting Plant (綦江電化冶煉廠) in Sichuan will use the complete set of equipment of the Ziyang Iron Smelting Plant's (資渝煉鐵廠) 15-ton iron smelting furnace to resume iron production. The quality of iron ore on Hainan Island is excellent. Last year, a barter trade agreement was signed with Japan for a total of 200,000 tons, which was shipped out last month. Weng Wenhao, chairman of the Resources Committee (資源委員會), also flew to Guangdong to plan to set up a steel plant in Guangzhou to utilize the iron ore from Hainan. The Hubei Daye (湖北大治) has established the Preparatory Office of the Central China Iron and Steel Company (華中鋼鐵公司籌備處), preparing to use Japanese war reparations equipment to build a new plant within the year, and to assemble small-scale steel equipment with the existing machinery and materials, aiming to start production in the second half of the year to supply the needs of the Central China region. In addition, in Shanghai, there is the Shanghai Company, whose steelmaking part started construction in June last year. It has been eight months now, and it is said that the total production has reached 1,000 tons. The estimated national steel industry output for this year is 300,000 tons of iron ore, 46,000 tons of pig iron, and 16,000 tons of steel products. The output is very small, and because of the depletion of foreign exchange, imports from abroad are difficult, so there is no problem with sales. Raw materials are also mostly waste steel and scrap iron, so there is no shortage of them. The only difficulty is fuel.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Finance Formulates Five Measures to Prevent Suspected Fraudulent Remittances</h3>
<p>In order to prevent domestic remittances handled by various banks and firms from containing false or fictitious names and addresses of remitters and payees, the Ministry of Finance has formulated measures to be notified to various banks. The measures are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) When handling domestic remittances, whether by mail, draft, or telegraphic transfer, all banks and firms should request the remitter to fill in the true names (or the full names of institutions, companies, and manufacturers) and detailed addresses of the remitter and payee in the remittance application form.</p>
<p>(2) If the payee of a telegraphic transfer is replaced by a telegraphic code or the corresponding account number of the paying bank or firm, the remitter should still be requested to specify the original name and address of the payee so that it can be recorded in the remittance account. For drafts, if the remitter requests to issue a blank payee draft, the remitter should also be requested to fill in the name and address of the payee as the basis for accounting.</p>
<p>(3) For all remittances left for collection by the paying bank or firm (including remittances left for the payee to collect, remittances collected on behalf of the paying bank, and remittances of the nature of traveler's checks), the remitter should be requested to specify the reason why the address of the left-behind and the payee has not yet been determined, and the accepting bank should also note the reason in the account book.</p>
<p>(4) Except for interbank transfers, public fund transfers by military and government agencies, and fund transfers by local product, public utility, and transportation institutions, which should be handled by the institution or enterprise, for ordinary customer remittances, if the amount exceeds 200 million yuan per transaction, the paying bank should require the payee to provide a substantial guarantee before payment is allowed. If payment is made without a guarantee, and it is found that the name of the payee is false and the address is incorrect, the remitting and paying bank or firm shall be responsible.</p>
<p>(5) If banks and firms violate the above provisions, the Ministry of Finance will, depending on the severity of the circumstances, impose sanctions in accordance with the provisions of Articles 13 and 14 of the Measures for Strengthening the Control of Financial Business.</p>
<h3>Self-Prepared Foreign Exchange Imported Paper to be Supplied to the Market Soon</h3>
<p>Totaling More Than 7,000 Tons</p>
<p>The authorities have almost completed the processing of imported materials with self-prepared foreign exchange. Among them, there are various types of paper, which are quite large in number, reaching more than 7,000 tons, 90% of which are Canadian and Swedish newsprint. Paper merchants have already been rushing to handle purchase procedures, and the market demand can be met in the shortest time. According to paper merchants, the recent decline in paper prices is due to the above-mentioned stimulus. It is predicted that after the increase in supply, paper prices may continue to fall sharply.</p>

<h3>Observations on the Indian Scientific Community</h3>
<p>— Translated by Yang Shi</p>
<p>India and China are both ancient Eastern countries that have contributed brilliant cultures to the world in the past. Today, both of these independent Eastern powers are absorbing Western civilization and engaging in scientific development. Due to historical reasons, India started earlier than us, but it still has many shortcomings. The stones from other hills can be used to polish jade. The situation of the Indian scientific community can serve as a lesson for us. This article is the most candid and sincere critique of the Indian scientific community published by Dr. Albert F. Blackeslee after a two-month tour in India. It also has value for alerting and guiding the Chinese scientific community. It is specially translated for our readers, with notes from the translator.</p>
<p>This is a report I personally wrote after attending the Indian Science Congress in Delhi in the winter of 1947 (i.e., January and February). Scientists from various countries attended the conference. The American side included Dr. W.E. Deming, Dr. H. Shapley, representing the American Association for the Advancement of Science (A.A.A.S.), and the author. In addition, there were three representatives from Canada, nine from the United Kingdom, two from the Soviet Union, one from France, and one from China (Dr. Chen Xingshen). Besides attending the Delhi Congress, we also visited universities and scientific laboratories in many major cities in India, including Winnipeg, Lahore, Benares, Calcutta, Madras, Karachi, and Bombay. I don't want to write this report in detail, but only share some personal impressions from my hurried visits with American scientists.</p>
<p>Although it only took us a short thirty-four hours to fly from the United States to India, their customs and religions were very far from what we left behind. There are many surprising differences on this land, such as climate, ethnicity, language, religion, and the form of government. In our opinion, there is a huge disparity between the poverty of the common people and the enjoyment and luxury of the upper classes. We found many common people sleeping on the streets or on the stone steps of Delhi's greatest mosque because they were too poor to have any other place to stay; but later, the luxury of the banquet at the Governor's Mansion in New Delhi surprised an American. At the tables of many wealthy industrialists, you could drink many precious wines and champagnes. In fact, whether Indian or British, the people we representatives contacted at the conference were all academics and some members of the ruling class. The truly poor Indians had little opportunity to be contacted.</p>
<p>This science conference was also divided into several groups for discussion, much like the American Association for the Advancement of Science. The enthusiasm of the discussions and the vividness of the criticisms made us deeply feel that Indians have made great progress in science. Although India has hundreds of different languages and dialects, the entire venue was controlled by English, which must have surprised some Americans. The languages of northern India mostly evolved from ancient Aryan languages, while the Dravidian languages of southern India evolved from another ancient language. Thus, English has become the common language for educated Indians. Except for two Islamic universities, all higher education institutions teach in English. It can also be seen from here that a universal language is of great benefit to the transmission of science. Although a large proportion of people can speak Hindi, there are many Indian universities where professors are engaged in finding a national language that can be used throughout India to replace English; perhaps this is due to their excessive national consciousness and therefore want to break off all relations with Britain.</p>
<p>Indians have given us many novel experimental methods, but unfortunately, these have not been valued by other nations. For example, an outstanding female botanist, when discussing the utilization of seaweed, declared that their efforts in this area were no less than those of the United States. Every farmer has a fish pond, and after adding a certain chemical substance, it stimulates the growth of seaweed, allowing the fish to grow quickly. Every American scientist has heard of this, but so far, we have not done it that way. Indians all believe that everything in America is replaced by machines instead of manual labor, but they do not understand how expensive manual labor is in America, while in India, manual labor is the cheapest and there are the most workers.</p>
<p>Indian university students and young scientific workers mostly hope to study in the United States. We are often surrounded by requests to help them enter American universities. Some even boldly visit us before breakfast to make the same request. One student, only fifteen years old, declared that he hoped to come to the United States to study atomic physics.</p>
<p>Politically, Indians are very concerned about all of America's domestic and foreign policies. Nehru, at a dinner party he hosted for Dr. Shapley and me (accompanied by two Indian scientists), expressed a great need to know some of the attitudes of American foreign policy, especially regarding the relationship between the United States and the Soviet Union. He was even more concerned about the role of the Republican victory in Congress in 1946 on this policy. Nehru's keen interest and understanding of other countries, as well as his great achievements in improving the lives of the Indian people, were very moving to us. Almost all people of all classes want to learn from the United States, but they do not want Westerners to treat them as inferior races as objects of charity. They hate the "sense of national superiority" of some Western whites in South Africa and India the most; in retaliation for South Africa's discrimination against Indians, they have announced a boycott of South African goods imports. A sign saying "South Africans not allowed" was posted at the entrance of a hotel in Bombay.</p>
<p>In fact, both Indians and British are relying on the United States. In January and February 1947, when the British government had not yet decided on the date of withdrawal from India, many British officials were already panicking. They believed that the Indians would soon take their place; some British hoped that the United States could morally assist India so that she could stand on her own.</p>
<p>India once had a culture that made them proud, its antiquity can be traced back to the ancient Aryan era. The Vedic classics of two thousand years before the Common Era still have valuable literary value. Before I went to India, when I talked to British officials, I thought that the Indian nation was a nation of low intelligence, but after my visit, I completely changed my original view, and also saw that the British said that the Indian nation was incompetent and had ulterior motives. Indian scholars know that they need to learn science and technology from the West, but this learning is due to the compulsion of objective circumstances, not subjective initiative, so the change is quite timid.</p>
<p>In my conversations with many Indian scholars, I pointed out that in the first one or two decades of this century, the United States had to learn from Europe, especially from Germany, which was a leader in science, but not long ago, Americans had realized that this did not take much time. Similarly, today India needs to learn from the West and send a large number of students to receive the baptism of science. Regardless of whether the colonial policy that the British Empire used to implement in India should be condemned and cursed, their contribution to the development of Indian science is indelible, especially in . Many British scientists I met did devote most of their lives to the progress of Indian science, but when Britain was about to withdraw from India, some had to leave India to seek jobs in other countries. We always hope that the cause they have devoted themselves to will not be completely abandoned because of this, and that under the efforts of the Indians themselves, its level can be further improved.</p>
<p>The British often say that Indian scientists have great success in theoretical physics and mathematics. Although Raman, who won the Nobel Prize in Physics, is indeed an outstanding experimentalist, there is still some truth in this. They are not very good at some experimental work, but the enthusiastic research spirit of some experimental workers is admirable. I found that the biggest shortcoming of Indian scientists is that they are unwilling to use their hands, a shortcoming that scientists in other countries often commit. This lack of recognition of the sacredness of manual labor and the strict social class system—which is now slowly decreasing—has been a great obstacle to their scientific and technological progress. I met a consultant for science and engineering in a certain province who told me that when he was studying at a polytechnic university in the United States, he had to do more than other students. During the summer vacation, he worked hard to earn tuition, and sometimes went to restaurants to wash dishes. But when he happily wrote these things to his parents, he immediately received two sea telegrams ordering him to stop doing this, because it would insult their noble family. He also told me that he had used 1,200 rupees per month (equivalent to 400 US dollars) to hire an engineer, but this person only wanted to sit at a desk all day long. If he asked him to go to the factory to actually operate, he would refuse. In my conversation with them, I said that I sometimes helped my wife wash dishes at home, which is a valuable thing. Using your hands to work is really the best homework. If Indian scientists come to visit the United States, they will learn this valuable spirit from American scientists.</p>
<p>An American vice-consul stationed in India told me that an event can illustrate the difference between American scientists and Indian scientists. When an American receives a Doctor of Philosophy degree, that is only the starting point of his life's career, but when an Indian receives a Doctor of Philosophy degree, it seems that it is the end point of his work because he feels that he has reached the goal he has been pursuing. Once an Indian scholar has secured a university professorship, he stops all scientific pursuits. They believe that a person's position is far more important than the work itself. Those who are truly engaged in the most basic experiments and research at the university cannot approach us to discuss their research experience. In fact, I found that they were forced to stay away from us. In many of my lectures, I suggested that exchanging ideas is the most necessary for progress.</p>
<p>Recently, I received a letter from an Indian student. The matter is like this: the Indian government is preparing to send several graduate students studying for a doctorate to study at the Institute of Biology, Smith College, in the United States. The list was announced, and he was not admitted. He asked me to write a letter to the Indian government asking them to reconsider their decision; in the letter, he implied that this matter would have a great and important impact on him. We often hear them complain that because of personal relationships or political reasons, most of the students sent out by India are not the most outstanding students, etc. We cannot judge whether this accusation is true or just resentment after not being admitted; but fundamentally, I have never written a letter of request for them.</p>
<p>I would very much like to be a chieftain (Manaraja) of an Indian princely state, not because he would have amazing wealth, countless wives, and a highly life of enjoyment, but because his power and financial resources could enable Indian science and technology to make rapid progress and use science to improve people's living standards. We feel that in India, whether public or private donations for public welfare undertakings need to be promoted very much. Fortunately, we visited several scientific institutions that were either entirely or partially funded by private donations; such as the Bose Institute for Plant Research in Calcutta and the Tata Hospital in Bombay. We also attended the donation ceremony of the Sirila Duke Industrial College during the conference, but such institutions are very few. There are not many large industrialists in India to begin with, and the wealthy simply do not have the habit of donating money to start scientific and educational undertakings.</p>
<p>Many distinguished Indians have titles given to them by the British Empire, but there is a common view that this is just a way to express one's loyalty to the British royal family with money. If I were an Indian government official, I would definitely abolish these titles and peerages and replace them with Indian-based titles. I suggest adopting the title "Indian Benefactor" (Inaian Benefactor) to those who donate money to promote art, literature, science, and philosophy; this is like the Nobel Prize, not with a wider scope. An Indian would feel greatly honored to add the letters "I.B" after his name. (I.B. are the initials of Incian Benefacor, not B.I because this is confused with "British Incia.") The names still follow Indian customs, and then we hear Ishaad Benefactor instead of Sir John and other English names. It is more honorable to encourage wealthy people to donate money to improve the welfare of their compatriots than to offer it to the British royal family!</p>
<p>I am so frankly criticizing many shortcomings of the Indian scientific community, but in fact, the American academic community also often commits them. After I traveled back to China, I felt that our Indian scientific friends have the highest sincerity and perseverance, and at the same time, I firmly believe that India is a place with great potential. Their scientists and university students value our visits and lectures very much. Personally, I learned more from there than I contributed to them. This kind of visit is not only beneficial to scientific colleagues in India and the United States, but also can enhance mutual understanding between countries. There is only one science in the world, it does not distinguish national boundaries, and mutual observation and exchange between scientists from various countries is the most necessary and most beneficial.</p>
<p>Regarding the status of Indian science, there are very few documents in our country. As far as the translator knows, Professor Liu Cheng, the editor of this journal, has written a book "Indian Science," which is published by Zhengzhong Book Company. It describes the history of Indian scientific development, the current situation, and scientific institutions and famous scientists in detail, which can be used as a reference.</p>
<h3>The Spiral Nebula and the Stars</h3>
<p>—</p>
<h3>Panoramic View of Wilson Peak's Heavenly Terrace</h3>
<p>— Xian</p>
<h3>Scientific Chats Starry Sky Chats</h3>
<p>— Pan Chenglie</p>
<p>On a clear night without moonlight, looking up at the starry sky full of stars, this glittering and magnificent spectacle will make people shudder and feel how insignificant mankind is. People who gaze at the stars mostly wonder about the mechanism and what exactly is revealed by these stars; more people are moved by the beauty of these celestial bodies.</p>
<p>It seems that there are millions of stars visible to the naked eye. In fact, because we can only see half of the sky at a time (the other half is on the far side of the earth), we can only see at most 3,500 stars without the help of optical instruments.</p>
<p>With a good pair of binoculars, this number can be increased to 120,000. The 100-inch telescope on Mount Wilson can see about 1.5 billion stars. There are still countless more that are too far away to be detected by any instrument.</p>
<p>For many years, stars have been the guides and friends of sailors, shepherds, and camel herders, so the Greeks, Romans, and Arabs gave beautiful names to those more prominent constellations. Polaris, Altair in Aquila, and Arcturus in Bootes are shining poetically. With a little practice and using a star chart as a guide, these and hundreds of other individual stars can be easily identified in the sky with the naked eye and distinguished by their color and size.</p>
<p>The Egyptian astronomer Ptolemy divided the brightness of stars into six magnitudes. The faintest star visible to the naked eye is the sixth magnitude; a star 2.5 times brighter is the fifth magnitude, and so on, until the dazzling first magnitude stars such as Sirius, Arcturus, Rigel, and Procyon.</p>
<p>Stars have varying degrees of color, and we can distinguish the red Betelgeuse, the yellow Mira, and the light blue Vega. The changes in star color are due to changes in their temperature. Just like a iron rod heated up, it is initially dark red, then turns yellow as the temperature rises, and then becomes white-hot. So a dark red star, such as Aldebaran, is the least hot, with a surface of about 6,000 degrees Fahrenheit. A yellow star, such as Alpha Librae, is twice as hot. The hottest star in the sky is blue-white, and the surface temperature of Spica in Virgo reaches 36,000 degrees.</p>
<p>Astronomers use a bolometer to measure the temperature of stars, which is an electric meter that exposes a thin platinum strip to the radiant heat of the star and records their surface heat with the finest accuracy. Another type of thermometer for stars, called a thermocouple, is a set of radio vacuum tubes placed at the main focus of the telescope.</p>
<p>When we look at stars, they mostly seem to be the same size, but the variation is actually very large. Some can be measured with an instrument called an Interferometer. In 1920, Professor Megson calculated the diameter of Betelgeuse to be 270 million miles using the diffraction of light and complex mathematics—a monster 30,000 times larger than the diameter of our earth. However, Betelgeuse looks like a dwarf compared to the huge Alpha Herculis, because the latter is so incredibly large that if it were in the position of our sun, it would swallow the earth and extend beyond the orbit of Mars!</p>
<p>Since there are countless such giant stars in the sky, some people may wonder if the sky is too crowded? But as a certain astronomer said: "If you put three wasps in the sky over Europe, then the wasps will be more crowded in the sky over Europe than the stars are in space."</p>
<p>The space between stars is unimaginably vast. The sun (the star at the center of our solar system) is only 93 million miles from the earth, while Pluto, the outermost planet in the solar system, is 4 billion miles from the sun. Beyond that is a huge gap—an abyss of space that effectively isolates our solar system in the universe—until Alpha Centauri, the closest star to us, appears 25 trillion miles away. Sirius is twice as far. Sunlight reaches us in eight minutes, but the light from Sirius takes more than eight years to reach us.</p>
<p>These flickering points of light are just the foreground of the picture that constitutes the universe. Further away, we see a faint pearly band across the sky like a semicircle sprinkled with powder. This is the Milky Way, made up of the light of a trillion stars, so far away that they cannot be separated, plus a huge amount of star dust, which is matter in the embryonic stage, that is, stars that have not yet been born.</p>
<p>Sir James Jeans describes the Milky Way as like the rim of a large cartwheel rotating around a central hub. The center of the wheel is 50,000 light-years away from Earth. Our sun is one of the smaller stars in this system. In this Milky Way galaxy (there are at least 100 million similar galaxies in the universe), our Earth, which we are so proud of, is no more than a small speck of pollen floating on the Pacific Ocean.</p>
<p>But measurable distances are far beyond the Milky Way. The large telescope on Mont Wilson helped astronomers obtain the light of globular clusters, which are clusters of stars like bee swarms, and it takes 18,000 to 184,000 years for their light to reach the Earth. For example, the light emitted by the globular cluster M13 in Hercules around the time when humans first appeared on Earth in the Stone Age only enters the eyes of astronomers today.</p>
<p>If the remoteness of these globular clusters has aroused your imagination, then the greater distance of the so-called "Island Universe" will make this imagination numb. In the depths of distant space, these "nebulae" are rushing towards the edge of the universe at an alarming speed. Professor Shapley of Harvard University proved that the light of the nebula M87 takes eight million years to reach us, but don't forget that light can travel 186,000 miles in one second!</p>
<p>The newly completed 200-inch telescope on top of Mont Paroma in California, USA, cannot, as commonly said, make new discoveries in all aspects. For example, it would be a waste to use this large telescope to observe the moon, because the most effective examples for studying the moon are telescopes of appropriate size, about 6 inches to 20 inches. The main function of this new telescope is to collect light from incredibly distant parts of the universe, increasing our knowledge of space beyond a trillion light-years.</p>
<p>Is the universe closed, with a certain size and limited boundaries? (This statement is based on Einstein's (Einstein) saying that space is curved back to its original place, somewhat like the curvature of the earth's surface,) or as Eddington (Eccington) believed, is it an expanding universe, filled with tens of thousands of galaxies like ours, each continuing to rush towards boundless space at incredible speeds? Are the current stars still in a state of extreme chaos and explosion, where atomic chain reactions change the original matter into heat, light, and electromagnetism? Like our sun (a small star), every second it transforms 4.2 million tons of matter into energy. It is this possible convertibility of matter and energy—published by Einstein in 1905 using a theoretical formula—that gave our physicists the first definite way to know the terrible and infinite power hidden in atoms on the ground.</p>
<p>A star is just a large pile of perpetually exploding atoms. Under the attack of terrible heat at the center, the gas atoms are completely shattered, and the fragments of electrons and nucleons collide in a chaotic manner. But the internal pressure at the center of the star is so terrible that it crushes the shattered atoms together to form matter of incredibly high density—so large that one cubic inch of this matter would weigh several tons. (Compared to these heavy atoms, our seemingly solid earth is only composed of dandelion fluff,) When nuclear physicists split uranium atoms, they only took a tiny fraction of the energy creation process that has always been happening in stars.</p>
<p>In fact, all astronomical observations today are done using photography: faint stars that cannot be seen even with the largest lenses can be recorded on photographic plates exposed for several hours (or days). Changes that the sharpest observer cannot detect can be identified by telescope cameras. Professor Lowell calculated the existence of Pluto, the outermost planet in our solar system, using difficult mathematics, but it took fifteen years of effort and countless photos to find the wandering planet's position in the sky.</p>
<p>With human wisdom, the mystery of the universe is gradually being revealed to us. The progress of science has expanded our view of the universe. In this boundless space, the earth's position is really smaller than a drop in the ocean.</p>

<h3>On the Cultural Atmosphere</h3>
<p>— Wu Yong</p>
<p>I, the author, enjoy reading. However, this is merely reading for the sake of reading, without any particular purpose. My ambition is not in applying what I learn, nor do I believe that reading has any mysterious power. My reading is simply a hobby, like smoking. Smoking certainly has no benefits, but not smoking always makes me feel restless. Books are the same to me in this regard.</p>
<p>It's just that in recent years, the situation has been turbulent, and prices have soared, making life a problem for most people. I, naturally, am no exception. Amidst the hardships of life, how can I still enjoy the hobby of reading? Perhaps it's a case of "birds of a feather flock together." Occasionally, I have the chance to meet with a few like-minded friends. Inevitably, we talk about books old and new, discuss recent publications, and look at the colorful books we have read on our bookshelves. In such an atmosphere, my long-diminished interest in reading is rekindled. I feel that reading Chinese and foreign books, old and new, is indeed a pure joy, a great pleasure in life.</p>
<p>If we want to arouse people's interest in reading, the first thing we must consider is whether the person has a propensity for reading. Because everyone has their own personality, which is not easily changed. If someone doesn't have a reading disposition, no matter what methods you use to attract them, I think it will all be in vain. Second, even if someone has a propensity for reading, if they lack a reading environment and opportunities to interact with scholars, their interest in books will be diminished, and they may even develop no fondness for books at all.</p>
<p>Therefore, reading requires the most attention to the atmosphere of reading. Whether cultivating the habit of reading among the general population and creating a strong reading atmosphere in society is beneficial is, of course, difficult to say, but at the very least, it won't have a negative destructive effect. However, the reality is that people today don't pay attention to this point and rarely make an effort. They put all their efforts into destructive endeavors. Consider that even in a civilized country like the United States, people pay tuition to attend university, and university education is not considered compulsory national education. However, in military education, such as at West Point, students not only have their tuition waived from admission to graduation, but also receive free room and board. This shows that the American government also emphasizes military affairs over culture.</p>
<p>Stringfellow Barr, in his book "Let Us Understand Each Other," makes a statement that I consider to be a profound truth. He says, "People are united by hate, not by love." This statement is a distillation of the author's observations of facts throughout history. Many people, upon hearing a bugle call, will raise their arms and eagerly join the military. If a third- or fourth-rate speaker gives a stirring speech, it will surely move the audience to tears or make them applaud and cheer. If a first-rate scholar gives an academic lecture, although some people will go to listen, I fear that few are there for academic reasons, and most are there to satisfy their curiosity. Furthermore, Jesus spent his life preaching the philosophy of love, but he had only a dozen or so disciples, while those who opposed him were in large groups. As a result, Jesus was outnumbered and eventually killed by the group of haters.</p>
<p>It is a great tragedy of mankind that people are easily united by "hate." However, I believe that this is not necessarily due to human nature. Perhaps it has something to do with postnatal education. From ancient times to the present, people have devoted themselves more to destruction. Eventually, one day, they will shift their gaze from "hate" to "love." However, to achieve this goal, we must still rely on people's emphasis on education and the promotion of culture.</p>
<p>To promote culture, we must first create a "cultural atmosphere." There is a passage in Boswell's "Life of Johnson" describing the gatherings of scholars at that time. The strong cultural atmosphere of that group is truly enviable. An excerpt is translated below: "Johnson liked to prop up his feet and pour out his heart. But when he gathered with his articulate friends, his conversation was especially brilliant. In 1764, these friends formed a club, which gradually became a great force in the literary world. The club's reviews of new books would immediately spread throughout London, causing an edition to sell out instantly or causing new publications to be abandoned for use by box makers and pie makers. This is not surprising, as the members of this club were all first-class erudite scholars. For example, Goldsmith was a representative of poetry and light literature; Reynolds was a representative of art; Burke was a representative of political philosophy; in addition, there was the historian Gibbon and the linguistic master Harris. When the famous actor Garrick attended, he always brought endless jokes. Bennet Langton was an authority on Greek literature; Topham Beauclerk was known for his elegant behavior and witty remarks, and he was very knowledgeable about the world of romance. In such a group, it was not easy to lead the crowd, but Johnson was the leader of this group."</p>
<p>Our country's scholars and talented individuals also need such a club. This club can serve as a club for scholars on the one hand, and naturally, it can also achieve the benefits of "pooling wisdom" on the other.</p>
<h3>The "Room" Shortage at Westminster Abbey</h3>
<p>— Wu Jiu</p>
<p>Westminster Abbey in London is not only where the royal family holds grand ceremonies, but also where British celebrities are buried. However, the land of Westminster Abbey is limited, while the number of celebrities throughout the ages is endless. As a result, it is also experiencing overcrowding. As early as 1907, the Westminster Abbey authorities stipulated that in the future, each burial would be limited to a bottle of ashes to save space. However, even with this measure, it still cannot accommodate so many celebrities. Anxious, the authorities reviewed the register of "celebrities" buried throughout the abbey, preparing to relocate minor celebrities if necessary to make way for major celebrities. Unexpectedly, the review yielded quite surprising results. It turned out that in this solemn and sacred place, among many wealthy families, literary figures, and scholars, there was also a little-known gatekeeper, a laundress, a lead worker, and a swindler who had been sleeping here for a long time!</p>
<h3>Memorizing the Dictionary</h3>
<p>— Nian Hong</p>
<p>There is an extremely common idiom that is widely known: "Constant dripping wears away the stone." It illustrates the truth that perseverance leads to success.</p>
<p>However, any golden rule must be used flexibly. Otherwise, even the Bible can be quoted by the devil. If you stick to the literal meaning, you can easily make a fool of yourself. I remember when I was in middle school, there was an English teacher who was a self-taught and hardworking student. He didn't attend university, but he was quite knowledgeable in English. Even now, I still admire his character and efforts very much. However, I really couldn't praise his teaching methods at the time. It turned out that he taught students to memorize the dictionary after class. According to him, an English-Chinese dictionary with 30,000 to 40,000 words could be memorized completely in five or six years if you memorized 20 words every day, persevered, and didn't interrupt or neglect it. He had done it this way himself and still knew most of it by heart. At that time, some students tried to follow his instructions. I was one of them, but I gave up halfway in less than half a month. None of the other students did any differently than me.</p>
<p>Looking back now, I really find it ridiculous that I used such a stupid method because I lacked guidance. It wasn't entirely my fault, but it was ridiculously pedantic to teach students to do the same. There is no doubt that perseverance can lead to success, but it would be foolish to open a needle factory and use iron rods to grind them into needles. Iron rods can be ground into needles, but wouldn't it be twice as effective to divide the iron rods into small pieces and then grind them?</p>
<p>Because people like to be quick and convenient, scientific methods are invented. It is economical to get the greatest results at the lowest cost. Unnecessary sacrifices are the worst example to follow.</p>
<p>Take war as an example. Even if a lone soldier or a suicide squad can charge into the enemy ranks and strike a blow with courage and ability, the result is still not worthwhile. Either they "die gloriously" or "the entire army is annihilated." No miracles will occur in the 20th century. Especially in modern warfare, the struggle has long since evolved from who has the bigger fist and the stronger arm to a battle of wits between brains. Planning strategies and achieving victory from afar, the simple and primitive methods of battle have long been eliminated. Although we should not fall into the trap of "weapon worship," we should not rely solely on spontaneity in all our estimations.</p>
<p>"The application of blood is like money. Parsimony is unacceptable, but waste is a big miscalculation." We certainly shouldn't cherish ourselves too much, but is it worth undervaluing ourselves, letting time be wasted on trivial matters, and letting life be consumed innocently on ordinary details? A burst of recklessness is certainly indispensable, but we must also know how to use methods to reduce unnecessary losses. Saving time is prolonging one's own life and ability.</p>
<p>However, it is even worse to talk about methods without seeking practical results. If you can talk about theory eloquently but can't move a step when you need to take action, then it's better to charge forward with explosives strapped to you and kill a few enemies than to talk about strategic situations. It's better to memorize a dictionary, which will at least help with English, than to do nothing.</p>
<h3>Two New Disciplines</h3>
<p>— Qi Feng</p>
<p>Everyone agrees that we enter university to seek advanced knowledge and research opportunities. However, although the pursuit of knowledge is the biggest reason for entering university, guidance and discussion on the issues of life and cultivation that young people need are equally important. Unfortunately, universities have overlooked this importance.</p>
<p>The faculty of Shanghai University recently discussed the problem of young people. After debate, the vote resulted in a majority of professors agreeing to add "Courtship" and "Marriage" to the existing purely academic curriculum. I believe that this bold, innovative, and realistic decision is worthy of attention. (As reported in this newspaper on the 25th.)</p>
<p>Many knowledgeable and intelligent young people have suffered tragedies such as madness, suicide, and running away due to the pain of love and the failure of marriage. Their achievements in scholarship and career have also disappeared with them. This terrible loss is because they lack a true understanding and knowledge of the problems of love and marriage. In fact, we all have to go through the stages of love and marriage. So why don't schools establish these subjects that are so important, so that young people can gain a correct understanding under the guidance and enlightenment of good professors?</p>
<p>In the United States, due to the needs of university students, discussions on issues related to women have long been a formal discipline. Well-known psychologists, doctors, and experts on youth issues are invited to help them solve their problems. Why is it that we Chinese youth, with the same needs, cannot even get a correct answer and guidance on the problems of love and marriage?</p>
<p>"Courtship" and "Marriage" are two essential disciplines. If they are valued by schools and students and their functions are well developed, they will surely reduce many of today's so-called love or family tragedies. This may also be a sign of progress for society.</p>
<p>This is a new and realistic suggestion, and I hope it will receive support from all sides!</p>
<h3>Poetry Records from Sea Red Tower</h3>
<p>— Xu Banmeng</p>
<p>Harmonious Sound</p>
<p>Since Zhong Ziqi's departure, Bo Ya has grieved,</p>
<p>A generation's confidant, forever estranged.</p>
<p>Heaven and earth, full of emotion, leave me to grow old,</p>
<p>Rivers and mountains, silent, bid people farewell in haste.</p>
<p>Life's path is as narrow and treacherous as the Silkworm Thicket,</p>
<p>The sea of dust is cast off like a butterfly's dream, so cool.</p>
<p>The twelve immortal towers, with five-colored brushes,</p>
<p>Perhaps in Chengdu, there is a Manqing gone mad.</p>
<p>Hometown</p>
<p>The autumn cold in East River breaks the heart,</p>
<p>Sad clouds like the sea darken the wilderness.</p>
<p>On the eighth month's tide, white horses gallop,</p>
<p>At the end of Three Mountains and Sea, red sheep run.</p>
<p>Submergence cannot save from the pain of approaching the abyss,</p>
<p>The small sky cannot cure the blindness of sitting in a well.</p>
<p>Sadly, the mountain colors of Jingnan are dismal,</p>
<p>Red maples like blood, frost flies in the night.</p>
<p>Spring Sorrow Sent to a Friend</p>
<p>Flowers lock the green moss beside the narrow lane,</p>
<p>Sparse willows along the Wu dike carry roosting crows.</p>
<p>All spring long, I carry a staff, sorrowing for the end of spring,</p>
<p>All day long, I climb the tower, watching the setting sun.</p>
<p>The night moon over a thousand mountains obscures old forts,</p>
<p>Evening clouds in two places hear mournful horns.</p>
<p>Only the traveler's robe remains, with a thousand lines of tears,</p>
<p>Where is the home that spreads throughout China?</p>
<p>High Heaven, Great Earth, past, present, and future,</p>
<p>Ancient traces, distant, sink for ages.</p>
<p>Wealth and status are irrelevant to matters of life and death,</p>
<p>Right and wrong do not stir the ashes of the heart.</p>
<p>Carefree seagulls and herons are all my friends,</p>
<p>Pleasing moss and lichen make up appreciative sounds.</p>
<p>Let's keep the good times we have before our eyes,</p>
<p>There's no need to entrust lingering sounds to a jade zither.</p>
<h3>Wandering Flower</h3>
<p>— Chen Shenyan</p>
<p>Striving to Remedy (112)</p>
<p>When Zhu Zhai heard this, he couldn't help but shudder. He never thought she would resent him to this extent. He couldn't say the words he had prepared. He responded with a "Alright!" lowered his head dejectedly, and walked out of the house. Feng Sheng saw him out of the door and slammed it shut. Zhu Zhai turned around and looked at the door, unable to help but feel sad. At this moment, he was like a homeless dog, chased out by its master with a whip. He walked out of the alley alone and hailed a three-wheeled military vehicle, blankly returning to his dormitory. He lay on the bed, thinking about everything that had happened. He felt that Yunxiang and Feng Sheng acted completely differently. Each had her own style. Judging by their circumstances, neither could forgive him. What should he do about this? He had originally thought that Feng Sheng was a straightforward and cheerful person. If he begged her a few times in front of her, she would definitely agree. He didn't expect her to hate him so deeply, even saying that he was already dead and that she had no attachment to him at all. Judging from tonight's situation, it was impossible to reconcile with her. From what she showed him tonight, it could be said that she was completely disappointed. Only Yunxiang, although she resented him, kept it in her heart. In her words, there was still lingering affection. He would still go to her house tomorrow and express himself frankly. If he could get her understanding, their initial hope could still be achieved. He had previously thought there were all kinds of difficulties, but now, given Feng Sheng's expression, it would be easier to resolve. Zhu Zhai spent the night thinking wildly and didn't sleep well. The next day, he was too lazy to go to work. It was only after nine o'clock that he rushed to Yunqing's house. According to Li Ma, who served Yunqing, "Miss is sick and hasn't gotten out of bed." Zhu Zhai went straight to Yunqing's bedroom upstairs. Only Yunqing was lying in bed, her face sallow and her spirit very haggard. Zhu Zhai didn't wait to be greeted and sat down on the edge of her bed, asking, "What's wrong? Have you taken any medicine?" Yunxiang didn't say a word, tears welling up in her eyes. She turned her body around, facing the inside of the bed. Zhu Zhai gently patted her quilt with his hand and said, "What is it? What's bothering you?" Yunxiang replied with a sob, "I told you not to come. Why did you come again? I don't want to see you!" Zhu Zhai said, "I have nowhere else to go but you. I didn't sleep all night last night. I thought about it all night. I can only come here to talk to you." Yunqing said, "I told you to go home. Why don't you go back?" Zhu Zhai said, "I already went back last night. Feng Sheng chased me out. She said I was already dead and didn't want to talk to me anymore. How could I go back?" When Yunxiang heard this, she was very surprised. She turned her face towards Zhu Zhai and asked, "How did she chase you out? What did you say to her when you went back?" Zhu Zhai recounted in detail what happened from the moment he entered the door until he was chased out. Yunxiang said, "This is your recklessness. No wonder Feng Sheng!"</p>
<h3>Lu You's Diary</h3>
<p>— Chen Zuogao</p>
<p>After the Southern Song Dynasty, Lu You and Fan Chengda were known for their diaries. He Yu (Zi Duren) of Anlu in the Ming Dynasty said in his "Yi Bu Tan Zi," volume one: "Lu Wu-guan and Fan Shi-hu of the Song Dynasty were both masters of diary writing. One has 'Ru Shu Ji' (Entering Shu Diary), and one has 'Wu Chuan Ji' (Wu Boat Diary). They record the scenery of the Three Gorges, not different from painted pictures, and are vivid when read." It is noted that You (1125-1210), styled Wu-guan and nicknamed Fang-weng, loved the customs of Sichuan all his life, so he wrote "Jian Nan Shi Gao" (Sword South Poetry Drafts) and "Ru Shu Ji" (Entering Shu Diary). The History of the Song Dynasty says, "When Chengda was in charge of Shu, he made him a consulting official; people criticized him for being slightly uninhibited, hence the nickname Fang-weng." (Song Shi, volume 395, biography 154, biography of Lu You) This book in six volumes, is probably from the Qian Dao period; it is a record of You's journey from Shanyin, Zhejiang to Bianzhou as a deputy prefect. Fang-weng himself said, "On the sixth day of the twelfth month of the fifth year of the Qian Dao era, I received a report... I was sick for a long time, and rice was not suitable for labor." So he set off late on the eighteenth day of the intercalary fifth month of the following year, and the record began at that time and ended early on the twenty-seventh day of the tenth month of the same year when he arrived at Yaozhou. During this journey, he left the Grand Canal, crossed the Yangtze River, and entered the Three Gorges. The mountains and rivers, the favorable and unfavorable winds and waters, a single boat leisurely, living on the boat for nearly half a year. The thorny terrain and difficult roads of Shu can be imagined. Furthermore, he used a clear and elegant writing style to correct ancient sites. How could it be compared to "indulging in scenery and recording trivial details?" Zhang Peilun of the Qing Dynasty also commented on it in his "Jian Yu Diary," which will not be repeated here.</p>

<h3>Semi-Insider News</h3>
<p>— Diao Ying</p>
<p>The world seems to have a fondness for exploring people's privacy, so whether it is newspapers or magazines, both domestic and foreign, as long as they publish more insider news or political secrets, they can always be welcomed by readers. Some newspapers in Shanghai competed to publish insider news some time ago, but in reality, most of these insiders were already public secrets, and some didn't even qualify for the word "secret." It was just that the reporter had sorted out the news that had already been published in fragments, making it easier for readers to understand the ins and outs and giving them a fresh impression.</p>
<p>However, a new writing style is currently popular in the American news world. They use empathetic writing and concise, tight text to report rumors, speculations, and fantasies as much as possible—sometimes there is also some real insider news. These kinds of things are mostly churned out daily in large quantities by some "columnists" and "radio commentators" who are all the rage. Because the reliability of their "news" is quite questionable and the "insider information" is not necessarily true to its name, I will tentatively call it "semi-insider news."</p>
<p>Even so, the readership of "semi-insider news" is broad and the influence is far-reaching. Because they are quite interesting and can satisfy people's desire to snoop into privacy. Recently, "Washington Newsletter," a column in Collier's magazine, was restored. The things published can be said to be standard "semi-insider news." The value of the news itself may be questionable, but this form of expression is still worthy of our attention. If it is used as a clue to interview news, it is even first-class material. Now, I will select and translate a few excerpts below.</p>
<p>(1) On the eve of the American election, Senate Speaker Vandenberg has reached a tacit understanding and close cooperation with presidential candidate New York Governor Dewey. The basis of their cooperation is twofold: first, they both strongly oppose candidate Republican Senator Taft; and second, they both highly approve of the Republican foreign policy adviser Dulles (Dulles has an even closer relationship with Dewey). According to people familiar with the inside situation, when the Republican convention is held in Philadelphia, Vandenberg will fully support Dewey so that Dewey can get the Republican nomination for presidential candidate. If he still fails, Vandenberg will join the race, and Dewey will give him full support.</p>
<p>(2) Truman's national universal military training bill is unlikely to pass. Although Truman has repeatedly emphasized the importance of universal military training, most congressmen ignore it.</p>
<p>(3) Although the results of the French election are still undecided, de Gaulle has been actively campaigning in the United States. There are many confidants of de Gaulle in the French Embassy in Washington. They not only do clever propaganda for de Gaulle, but also immediately report any news from the United States to de Gaulle. The Schumann government is aware of this situation but cannot stop it. (Translator's note: Prime Minister Schumann recently publicly criticized de Gaulle's policies as not in line with French national conditions.)</p>
<p>(4) The call for US Ambassador to the UK Douglas to be appointed as the director of the Marshall Plan is very high. Many people are now vying for the position of Ambassador to the UK, especially the current Ambassador to Australia Butler (formerly a big banker) and Ambassador to Poland Griffiths (a giant on Wall Street).</p>
<p>(5) Argentine dictator Peron once declared that he was willing to lend 5 billion US dollars to South American countries, which is all nonsense. In fact, Argentina's gold reserves and dollar reserves are extremely alarming. The UK once sold the railway built in Argentina to Peron, but it was extremely difficult to collect the debt from him. Peron only has some surplus grains left, and he wants to wait for a good price to sell them.</p>
