<h3>五六兩季輸入減少　限額表今合併公布　此次統制純為節省外匯</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十二日電〕第五季及第六季輸入限額，將於十三日合併公布，據輸管會十二日在全經會提出報吿，此次編制限額表時，其原則純爲節省外匯。至第五·第六季同時公布理由約有四點：（一）政府外匯困難，必須節省，節省以後之限額，對於工商之需要，一定相差甚遠，訂貨困難，容易引起誤會，造成心理上之恐慌，影響物價，故採兩季合併公布。（二）合併公布，可視輕重緩急，定分配月數，使外匯調配不致困難。（三）合併公布之第五·第六兩季總額，平均較第四季减少百分之十七。（四）兩季限額合併公布以後，本會對於此種限額外匯之大部分工業原料經製成貨品行銷市塲時，其價格變動，擬令其逐步報會，以便於管制。</p>
<p>〔本報南京十二日電〕第五季第六季輸入限額分配表，輸管會業已擬訂，並提出十二日全經會討論，經一小時餘之詳細研討，限額分配均大致決定，惟尙有一小部份須略作調整，會中決定交由小組委會審查，當推定王雲五，兪鴻鈞，左舜生陳啓天，霍寳樹，簡貫三等七人爲審查委員，並推定王爲召集人，定十三日上午十時舉行小組會審查，俟審查決定後，不必再經全經會討論，即可呈請張羣院長核准，於下午三時公布。第五季及第六季限額分配特點，爲較第四季减少一千五百萬美元，第四季總額爲五千三百三十餘萬美元，第五季則僅三千餘萬美元，第六季與第五季大致相同，惟尙有棉花，小麥及汽車第五項未死分配數目。十二日認論時，各委員對於限額之分配，提供意見甚多，王雲五主張汽油進口量應予减少，因根據節約方案，對於私人汽車之使用曾有限制，規定如汽油輸入過多，將與節約方案之原則相違，故應予核減。王氏痰主張對新聞約之輸入限額應予放寬，因上海紙增產計劃援不濟急，而目前各報銷路激增，對過去新聞紙之分配常感不敷用度，政府對文化事業應扶持，關於新聞紙輸入限額實有放寬必要。簡貫三提出三點意見，甲：輸入限額之分配，應表示外匯政策之動向，並應與張院長所擬之十項自助計劃相配合。乙：限額分配表應根據輕重緩急排列，不可後先輕重倒置，增减部分應作簡單說明。丙：有五項末列數目者，仍應列入，並應規定小汽車不得進口。左舜生，陳啓天等亦各發言，左氏主張肥料輸入應予增加，陳啓天並字張應增加機器及原料之進口，討論富久，除大部分巳決定者外，餘交由十三日小組會決定。十二日確定原則兩項，甲：限額總值較第四季减少及限額分配應與節約方案及張羣所提之十項自助計劃相配合，十三日將根據上述兩項原則作具體之法定。</p>
<h3>政府將採措施　平抑各地糧價　外商投資設廠另訂詳細辦法</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十二日電〕全經會十二日下午三時舉行第卅四次例會，張羣主席，首由副秘書長顧毓瑔報吿一週來滬，漢·津三地物價情形，一般言之，三地糧價均有波動，以漢糧價上漲最甚，滬次之，津較少，其原因爲時屆年關，商人多乘機抬價，政府現正設法籌揹對策中，將採取措施，加以平抑。自三月一日起，實施配售糧食後，相信糧價當可望好轉。繼即開始討論（一）歡迎外商來華投資設廠事，交由主管機關根據第一期經建原則，公司法，鑛業法擬訂詳細辦法，其內容將重新說明歡迎外商來華投資設廠，並特別給予外商便利，此事張院長在去年八月間曾有詳明表示，歡迎外商來華投資設廠，聲明發表後，曾有外商五家來華向經部登記申請設廠，我國各地商會爲此特向政府建議，主張對於外商設廠應有若干規定，十二百全經會時因提出討論，張羣對此事亦曾發言，調過去已有說明，可無須另作規定，可由主管機關擬訂詳細辦法。（二）第五季及第六季輸入限額表（見另條）交王雲五等七人，於十三日上午十時舉行小組會審查。（三）經濟改革方案財政部分實施辦法，修正通過（實施辦法已見一月十七日·十八日本報），原方案（六）實施辦法（甲）項內債之籌募及（乙）項外債之舉借部分刪除，其實施辦法至適當時期另行規劃。原方案（七）優先准許以黃金向央行請購外匯，爲購買許可進口物品之用，其實施辦法全部刪除，因去年二月頒布之經濟緊急措施，仍繼續實行，黃金不得作貨幣流通，故不能用以購買許可之進口物資，其實施辦法改爲至適當時期另行規劃。關於穩定幣制部分，原方案（五）政府應准許人民以黃金爲購買政府出售國營生產事業及敵僞產業之用，以增加法幣之準備，其實施辦法全部刪除，至適當時期另行規劃。經濟方案實施辦法結論中之實施辦法三點，亦全部刪除。（三）國營事業管理法，推定潘序倫及顧毓瑔等擬具辦法，草擬實施細則，於一週內草擬完成。</p>
<h3>經濟改革方案</h3>

<h3>美限制出口貿易　儘先供應本國抑平物價　經部研究此舉對我影響</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十二日電〕經部近據駐美使館商務參事處呈，略以美商務部國際貿易署近曾召集駐美各國大使館，公使館之商務參事或其他代表，宣布新輸出許可政策，其目的在維特競爭的私營貿易原則，以核發輸出許可證爲手段，冀達到儘先供給本國需要，平抑國內物價及减輕國外金元需要。其所統制出口物品計：第一批有四百餘種，對於我國進出口貿易影響甚鉅，將來我國所需自美國輸入之重要物資，勢將更受限制，經部現正詳加研究，並將於日內邀集有關各部會代表籌議適當辦法。</p>

<h3>馬歇爾在記者會上宣稱　援華案待總統決定　周以德氏責馬卿阻撓援華</h3>
<p>〔美國新聞處華盛頓十一日電〕馬歇爾國務卿十一日吿記者稱：五億七千萬美元之援華計劃，已自負責研究金融問題之全國顧問委員會接到，準備由預算局及總統作最後考慮。有詢以其中是否包括軍事援助在內者，國務卿答稱，此係一經濟建議，惟渠表示，此項建議將不干涉中國政府之行動自由。</p>
<p>〔聯合社伊里諾斯州畢奧里亞十一日電〕共和黨衆議員周以德，昨夜在此間公民協會發表演說，指斥國務卿馬歇爾「阻撓」援華，並籲請立即援助中國，以免淪爲共產黨所有。據稱：「馬氏工作艱鉅，殆不可能，渠雖爲一偉大之愛國者，但非爲一偉大之國務卿，吾等需要對於外交富想與才能之人物，其智巧與軍事訓練所養成者不同。亞洲現使美·蘇兩大武裝陣營實</p>
<p>平衡，美國需要中國尤甚於中國之需要美國，中國或能在共產主義滅亡後繼續生存，但此高度組織而脆弱之西方文明則不能」。</p>
<p>〔中央社紐約十日電〕太平洋學會所主辦之「遠東觀察」雙週刊，對美國援華事，今首次刊載表示贊成之文章。該文標題爲「援華間題」爲林巴哲敎授所撰，文中提出援華四大理由，略謂：就政治關係而言，除中國政府外，別無其他合法途徑予以援助，目前中國僅有兩大集團，國民黨與共產黨，亦無第三大然出現之希望。美國之民意及政治，茲不致支特共黨，故援華之對象，必爲南京國民政府，且援華亦與羅斯福政策相符。羅斯福政策計分兩方面：（一）與反法西斯國家作外圍聯盟之範圍內，與所有之非共產主義民主國家實行內圍聯盟，此即杜魯門目前所實施者。（二）承認蘇聯之勢力範圍，一如輩萊士所云者，就實際而言，經由國民政府而援華，乃實際可行者。魏德邁較其他任何人之經騐爲多，渠本人對此種種援助之有效，深具信心。至就人道觀點言之，援華實爲結束黃河以南戰事及穩定其他各地戰事之最佳方法，否則中國內亂必將延至國外。</p>
<p>〔中央社華盛頓十日電〕美國務院今宣布：聯總結束後，對華救濟經費一千八百萬元之實施計劃即可擬訂完竣，並於本週末公布。按國會於去年十二月舉行特別會議時，曾通過聯總結束後第二次援助中國之計劃。</p>

<h3>本年度國家總預算論（中）</h3>
<p>— 張白衣</p>
<p>鋒　不紋，蓬　國家行局庫吸收定期存款　　大　如後：</p>
<p>（一）財政　四聯總處及中央銀行會同組織一吸收定期存款計劃委員會。</p>
<p>（一）財政部國庫署會同中央銀行國庫局發行特種優利短期國庫儲蓄股劵，例如英國財政部在戰時所發行之國庫儲蓄債券（Savings　Bonds）及國家儲蓄證券（National　Savings　Cartiliataes），定期一年，月息一角半；發行額至少十兆元。</p>
<p>（三）國家行局庫聯合發行特種　蓄存款證券，分三月六月及一年三種，月息分一角，一角半，及二角三種，三月及六月者可先扣利息發售，額面分一百萬，五百萬，及一千萬三種，藉以吸收小額儲蓄。其發行額為二十兆元。</p>
<p>（四）財政部委託中央信託局以敵僞產為中漢奸首飾逆產已收歸國有者以發行儲蓄獎券方式處理之，由該局中央儲蓄會及各區敵僞產業淸理處會同合作完成之，獎券每”發行一次，每次發行一千萬張，每張售價五萬元，預計全年可吸收儲蓄存款六兆元。</p>
<p>（五）中央信託局中央儲蓄會現有之團體分紅儲蓄存款繼續辦理，但存款額：及紅利額可酌加一倍至二倍，藉以增加吸收定期存款。</p>
<p>（六）中央信託局中央儲蓄會在戰時發行之特種有獎儲蓄券，戰爭結束後業已停止，但為吸收儲蓄計，亦可繼續辦理，每期發行五百萬號，每號售價十萬元，頭獎增為十億元，如此每年可吸收定期儲蓄六兆元，但還本期限似應由十年縮為三年。</p>
<p>（七）財政部在實施改革貨幣前，應有優待國家行局庫存款人之聲明；凡人民在國家行局庫普通存款在半年以上者，其存款額在一千萬元以下者，對新幣折合率比普通折合率减少百分之五〇）或三〇。如此可增加小額儲蓄，同時亦可使國民財富分配不因貨幣改革而有不平衡現象，且可加速貨幣現狀之穩定而利貨幣之改革。</p>
<p>（八）財政部國庫署及中央銀行稽核處應會同合作，加强稽核政府機關（包括一切國營事業及國立學校）庫款之出納，凡發現庫款由代庫銀行提出轉存於商業行莊而謀利者，對該機關經發即傳停止支付。</p>
<p>華者之　　如上。如政府果能如此　行，則深信國家銀行局庫之定期款及國定　蓄必能大量　加，同時國庫亦可吸收一部份儲蓄而至少可减輕一年間之若干負祖。倘國民能體諒政府而踴躍擁讓此種非常金融措施，一如戰時蘇聯與英國人民數日內購　公復之精神，則國民大部份購買力仍可一如戰前受控制於國家行局庫中，隨之物價將立即為之穩定，貨幣因物價穩定而漸趨恢復信用，國民對儲蓄興趣亦必漸吿恢復，結果則國計民生兩得其益。</p>
<p>第三問題為租稅徴收及庫款出納系統之現行制度是否健全問題。關於此點，極為重要。吾人應知，政府收入與支出若雙方均有舞弊現象發生，則收入愈小而支出愈大，結果成為赤字額之增加。吾人固不能懷疑財政部全部稅務系統之公務員個個貪污，亦不能懷疑政府各級機關及依賴國庫公款而活動之一切國營事業國立學校之庶務人員個個舞弊，但吾人亦不能保證絕對無此現象。民國二十七年國民政府公布實施公庫法之消極目的，原為防止此種現象。</p>
<p>但抗戰後期以來，因政府支出實際上步步下降，以及市塲物價受投機者之操縱日日上昇，公務人員之生活水準逐漸降低，直至今日猶未停止降低之趨勢。正因如此，公庫法遂不能達完美之目的。筆者亦不必多舉例證，即如最近上海兩大機關之貪污，已足表示此種事實之存在及其危險性。分析我國民族性，從來從政者大都廉潔自守，而人民之節儉美德，亦為數千年來之傳統精神，其所以發生此種現象者，一方面由於制度之未臻完美，他方面則為公務員生活水準之降低。所以筆者建議公務員生活待遇必須有合理之提高，已如前述，同時對於制度方面，似應有技術上之改革。</p>
<p>先述租稅徴收制度。按照公庫法所示，稅務人員可免直接收受現金，但事實上往往有徴稅員與納稅人共同舞弊，例如稅額應為一億元，徴稅員可徇納稅人要求减為三千萬元，而納稅人所漏繳之七千萬元中，一半中飽於徴稅員，結果國庫實收僅三千萬元，其餘七千萬元則已犧牲於雙方舞弊之中。吾人為防劍此糧可能發生之舞弊，必須僅力變更徵收制度。依筆者研究所得，在此非常時期，宜用非常措施，最好在中央系統粗稅上，股立一統一工商業稅，問時凡原有一切涉及工商業之課稅全部取消。依據全國各區商業景氣指標，幷規定一統一商業營業稅之定額，由財政部直接委託全國性之工商業法國，其徵收之方法僅由全國工商業法團通知各地工業會或商會，再由各地工業會成商會通知各工商業同業公會，再由各工商業同業會通知各工廠商店，自動按照規定稅額，直接繳付各地代庫銀行或代庫之金融機關。此種辦法僅限於非常時期，一俟戡亂結束，則再恢復原制。在微收此種統一工商業營業稅之優點甚多：（一）可免貪污舞弊發生；（二）市民繳納租稅一種，簡單而便利；（三）發揚納稅為國民天職之精神；（四）减少政府之徴收費用。依筆者粗枝大葉計算，政府如實行此統一工商業營業稅，國庫可年收入三十兆至五十兆元。</p>
<p>關於庫款出納系統，在制度上，因有公庫法之存在，似無問題，但事實所示，依公庫法第四·五條兩條規定，在一定的金額下政府各機關出納得自行保管及收支。是以各級機關事實上尙朱能在出納上毫無舞弊現象。但倘一切收支均須耗代庫銀行，當然亦頗困難。時至今日，各機關之庶務單位，欲期其完全廉潔自持，深信甚少。重要建築修繕支出及大宗購料支出，或大宗印刷支出，雖有投標規定及審計部派員監視，但事實上投票者往往即為一人或投標者往往祇有一人。筆者前供職於某機關時，凡關於建築修　之投標人，數十次中均為一人，此事頗為同人懷疑，但亦已為公開之秘密。故投標制度徒為形式問題。筆者深信，政府各級機關在庶務支出上，當不免有一筆可觀金額浪費於舞弊。</p>
<p>依據筆者研究所得，各級機構之總務或庶務單位主管人員，必須有深常識及革命頭腦，同時該機關主管者必須絕對避免起用親戚系統之人員任此庶務主管，如此則一日發現舞弊等情，自可立即移送法院。</p>
<p>第四關於公價政策問題。自法幣發生不安以降，銀行存款旣已大量外流，直接間接均成為投機市塲之遊資，對於公債自由購買現象可稱絕無。一方固然由於國民敎育程度及愛國心理之低下所致，他方亦為物價上昇速度超過發行增加自然率約十培所致，故人民對公債已成毫無興趣。正因公債政策之不能澈底運用，故更加深通貨膨脹之速度。因此，筆者以為，公債政策在此種困難下，必須設法繼續運用。銀行存款旣無法利用，公債政策如再不利用，則結果必致依然增加發行。為免此種　性循環之繼續，筆者建議政府應採取一種有效之公債政策。但亦不必發行美金單位或英鎊單位之公債，因此等公債旣影響法幣本身之信用，同時亦徒增政府國庫之負担，而且人民亦未必十分歡迎。筆者今建議政府發行一種有獎公債（Zinsenlotterieor　Praemienanlehen），公債單位仍為法幣，以十萬元為一分　，以百萬元為一全張，一全張有一號碼，每月開獎一次，發行每月一千萬號，即一千全張，共計金額為十兆元。其中提出百分之十爲獎金，即一兆元，其分配額如后：</p>
<p>等獎　一張　一千億元　共計　一千億元</p>
<p>二等獎　二張　五百億元　共計一千億元</p>
<p>三等獎　四張　二百五十億元　共計一千億元</p>
<p>四等獎　八張　一百二十五億　共計一千億元</p>
<p>五等獎　二十張　五十億元　共計一千億元</p>
<p>六等獎　一百張　十億元　共計一千億元</p>
<p>七等獎　一千張　一億元　共計一千億元</p>
<p>八等獎　一萬張　一千萬元　共計一千德元</p>
<p>九等獎　十萬張　二百萬元　共計二千億元</p>
<p>共計中獎獎券十一萬一千一百三十五張共計獎額一兆元</p>
<p>有獎公債為無利公債，還本期間為十年，十年中如貨幣改革時則依據新幣換算，並得與銀行存款同其優待。凡中獎獎券不再還本。政府倘接受此建議，則政府每年可由有獎公債吸收遊資一百二十兆元，除去獎金十二兆元及其他印刷紙張運輸手續成本外，尙有一百兆元。一方可因吸收大量遊資而穩定金融，他方由此亦可償淸一切戰時戰前所發行之內債（包括外幣單位公債），此點容後述之。此種有獎公債因有賭博性質，似不宜常用，但筆者認為，在此非常時期，利用此非常方法，尙不失為一優良之財政政策。蓋財政參加國民經濟金融市塲，亦為新興財政學學理上所要求者也。</p>
<p>第五關於國有財產收入問題。在戰前及戰時，國有財產收入在財政上原無足重輕，但自戰事結束後，因敵僞產業之收歸國有及美國剩餘物資之館贈及低價購入，故此項國有財產在理論上將為財政上重要財源。其中一部份敵性工廠收歸國有後改爲國營事業，故敵僞產業中主要收入當為漢奸逆產。但事實所示，漢奸逆產處理者固已不少，而大部份則均尙未處理。其原因為漢奸在普通司法機關處理程序太爲遲緩，自戰事結束後至今日已二年有半，而漢奸最後定讀者仍屬極少數，大部份漢奸罪狀至今尙未判定，結果使敵僞產業處理機關無法處理。</p>
<p>依據中央信託局蘇浙皖區敵僞產業淸理處於去年三月中發表，該處於民國三十四年十二月成立至民國三十五年十二月止，接收敵僞產業價値一兆二千〇二十四億七千萬元，其中已處理者為五千二百〇十五億五千萬元，未處理者為六千八百二十七億九千萬元。此外在於中央銀行之黃金有四十九萬八千七百卅一兩六錢九分七　．因其估價尙在民三十五年十二月，且其中若干產業物資尙係民國三十四年所估計者，故其估價問題尙有研究之必要。例如保存於中央銀行之黃金約四十九萬八千七百三十二兩，倘以今日市價換算，已値五兆元左右。據筆者所知，漢奸之寳貴首飾鑽石，翡翠，寳石，眞珠等物大部尙未處理，依照今日市價，至少比原來估價增加一百倍，故未處理敵僞產業六千八百二十七億九千萬元換算今日市價至少可升至六十八兆二千七百九十億元。去年中處理者固已不少，但尙有若干據密報後，續有發現之敵僞產業之隱匿財產。故依筆者粗枝大葉估計，今日全國敵偽產業倘能於今年中全部處理，國庫收入當可望有一百兆元，但此項國有財產却因政府各部門不能密切配合，任其擱置，且有若千重要經濟漢奸因被釋放或判無罪而或將仍由敵僞產業處理機關發還。倘依照現狀遲延下去，去年度國家總預算上國有財物之收入深恐仍將落空。蓋漢奸逆產中最多者為經濟漢奸，經濟漢奸之為漢奸，其目的原為吸收民脂民膏，恣情事受；此等漢奸不判重罪，已屬不智，倘再因少數達官之人情關係，隨便釋放，或竟宣判無罪，則更屬不可思議！曾憶國民政府蔣主席於八中全會中會有如下訓詞：「今後抗戰，軍事與經濟同時並重，今後敵我成敗之決定力，經濟七分，軍事三分」。此足證明當中日戰爭時經濟地位之重要。蓋日本資源頗缺乏，故提出「以戰養戰」之口號，其目的即利用中國經濟而侵略中國，若經濟漢奸即為其走狗，故其罪應等於軍事漢奸與政治漢奸。</p>
<p>回憶民國三十年九月三日，國民政府公布「禁運資敵物品條例，其第一條規定：「國內物品資敵，查禁及處理依本條例之規定」；第十一條規定：「偸運之物品如係售賣於敵人查有實據者，處死刑或無期徒刑」。又民國二十七年十月六日國民政府公布「非常時期農工礦工商管理條例」第二十九條亦有規定：「以原料品或物品供給敵人者處無期徒刑或七年以上有期徒刑。「可知國民政府對於經濟漢奸之處罰，早訂法律之原則，即凡為經濟漢奸至少有七年以上有期徒刑，至民國三十年時，鑑於經濟漢奸之對戰爭之重要性，故修正爲至少為無期徒刑。故此等漢奸原無須經法院長期審理，凡證據確實者，至少應判無期徒刑，即减刑亦至少應判七年以上有期徒刑。筆者建議，一切漢奸案件，務須於本年中全部判定，凡證據確實者，一律初判七年以上有期徒刑，其財產全部沒收，而敵僞產業清理機關即可查封其全部財產，立即予以標售或粕賣，其收入即為國庫國有財產收入。</p>

<h3>片山內閣提總辭職後　日本新內閣難產　首相一席各方屬目蘆田　吉田圖獨攬政權拒絕出席四黨會議</h3>
<p>〔新亞社綜合報導〕日本政潮問題，自片山氏於八日內閣會議上提出總辭職之議後，各方面活動尤見活躍。頃據東京十二日電訊稱：片山內閣已於十一日晨最後一次閣議中，決定總辭職，片山哲即於十一時半進宮向日皇提出辭呈，並於十一時四十分分別通告參衆兩院，在正式總辭職之前一日，片山首相已經發表了總辭職聲明書，大意謂「：內閣今日之總辭職，係聯合內閣必然難免的結果，余就日本民主政治之發展上未曾有一點錯誤，堪自慶幸，尤其極力避免解散衆議院，而使內閣總辭職，係對於國內外政治情勢予以公正判斷之結果。至於今後內閣，在無絕對多數黨的現狀下，余認爲組織聯合內閣較爲妥當，因聯合內閣可以增加外國對日本之信用，日本經濟乃得恢復，於今內閣雖然總辭職，然與余等之理想乃更接近。」在衆議院方面，自獲知內閣有總辭職之決議後，即於十日召開議院運用委員會，根據新憲法第六十七條討論新首相之提名問題，在該會議中，民主黨主張召開四大政黨黨首協商，小會派則羣起反對，衆議院議長松岡根據此項決議，於十一日晨分別訪晤民主黨蘆田，社會黨片山及國民協同黨三太各黨首，交換意見，一一一氏均同意召開四黨黨首會議之舉。然後松岡乃往見自由黨總裁吉田，吉田仍堅持反對，認爲自由黨旣為在野黨之第一大政然，當然應趨承政權，因此次期內閣之組織尚須數日之折衝。惟自由黨十二日舉行之幹部會議中，吉田茂氏演說似已表示對四黨聯合內閣間題可以妥協之意，惟自由黨在該項聯合內閣中應取得首相地位。在參議院方面，綠風會表示支持吉田氏，認爲吉田以在野第一大政黨之總裁資格，被提名爲下屆首相，乃「憲政當道」。一般觀察家則認爲：片山內閣之總辭職爲時過早，致使吉田之保守新黨運動未能成功，因保守新黨運動之未成熟，故民主，國協兩黨之表現，仍係支特四黨聯合內閣而不同情吉田氏之主張。截至片山內閣總辭職之日，衆議院各黨派勢力如下：社會黨一百二十三席，自由黨一百一十九席，民主黨一百零六席，國民協同黨三十二席，同志會二十二席，全農派十六席，第一議員俱樂部十五席，農民黨七席，共產黨四席，無黨派者二席，空缺二十名，在如上之勢力分配情形下，倘再加以若干之外在壓力，各黨派聯合舉國一致內閣之可能性最大，惟首相之提名問題，仍爲一重大難題，依現情勢推測，似蔗田氏膺選之可能性較大。</p>
<p>〔聯合社東京十二日電〕片山內閣因社會民主黨左右兩派內江已於十日辭職，但仍留任，以待議會任命新總理。</p>

<h3>日各黨意見紛歧　四大黨幹事長舉行會議　討論下期首相基本方針</h3>
<p>〔新亞社東京十二日電〕日衆議院議長松岡因舉行四黨黨首會議未能成功，爲從速決定下期首相問題，又於十二日下午二時十五分舉行自由，民主，社會，國協四黨幹事長會談。首由松岡報告未能召開四黨黨首會議之經過，次提出是否亦應使小會派代表參加此項會議問題，自由黨幹事長大野首先表贊成，決定自明日起，各小會派亦各派代表一人參加此項會談。</p>
<p>又在該會談中，大野曾稱：「吉田總裁之意見，希望組織以自由黨爲中心之保守聯合內閣，惟擬盡量不解散國會」。民主黨幹事長苫米地則稱：「舉國聯合內閣最屬妥當，此外任何性質之內閣殊不能贊成」，暗示與自由黨對立之意見。國協黨幹事長岡田立即表示贊成此議，顯然民主國協之共同戰綫業已成立。再社會黨幹事長淺沼則稱：「社會黨之態度，尚未決定」，保留態度。會後松岡語記者稱：「決定下期首相之基本方針，在明日之會議中，大槪可以成立，將來在國會，由議員提名而選定首相之舉不過多談而已，總之將努力從速決定之」。</p>

<h3>赫爾回憶録　（十七）</h3>
<p>— 北美報業聯合會版權所有　本報編譯室</p>
<p>戰禍蔓延訟人想起梵蒂岡</p>
<p>蘇聯與芬閘的戰事，在北部的雪中進行着。芬蘭的英勇已把蘇聯所預期的輕易進取，變成三個月的激烈戰爭。</p>
<p>這一戰爭，雖然在交戰國名單上增添了兩個，但是在一九三九年整個的最後數月中，歐洲却充滿着和平活動的謠傳。波蘭崩潰後的僵持時期，替和平謠傳與姿態造就了很好的理由。這些是我所關切的，因爲它們一致把美國與外傳進行着的和平運動聯繫在一起。</p>
<p>早在一九三九年十月二日，美國駐羅馬尼亞公使根室打電報給我說：羅外長對於美國總統發起和平運動的可能性，表示深切的興趣。翌日，我回電說明並無進行此種運動的企圖，並且也未曾接到任何交戰國請求我們發動和還的表示。　希特勒在他十月六日的演詞中，提出空洞的和平建議，——當然啦，這種和平將使他保有他在戰爭中所奪取的大部份以及捷克和奧地利。在他發表演說之後，駐比大使戴維斯致電給總統與我，說是某權威方而（後來知道是比王李奧柏）請求他說明：祗有總統才能防阻德國進攻西歐，而比利時很希望總統能够進行一種努力，和他在以前危局由所進行的一樣。</p>
<p>同日，（十月七日）我們駐柏林的參贊堪克來電稱：接近希特勒的某人士表示，總統可以利用希時勒的演詞做機會，以秘密電文致達希特勒，贊同「他的和平努力」，並請求他蘭明他對於建立和平的基本原則。兩天後，堪克電云：德方新聞發言人稱：假使總統建議休戰並談判和平，德方決可予以接受，他並且表示德方或可參加一個距離戰區很遠的會議（若干人認爲是指華盛頓而言）。翌日，美國駐芬公使桑飛爾來電，轉達芬外長的建議，說是美國可以發動試探和平的可能性。　在接到這許多同一性質的電文之後，我於十月八日星期日召集我的同事，在我的辦公室內舉行會議。我邀請戴維斯出席，當我特別需要他的高見和悠久經驗的時候，我時常都邀請他參與討論。對於美國此時是否可以在恢復歐洲和平方面進行合理的行動，我們之間已經有過很詳盡的討論。　在這星期日會議席上，我們曾審查美國可能提出的建議草案。在這裏面，我們將請求交戰國說明他們的和平條件；聲明我們願意担任中間人，把關於此問題的通訊，傳遞給交戰國的對方。在交換許多意見之後，我說明我並不以爲美國此時發起和平運動能够發生很大的作用。</p>
<p>因爲希時勒一直都是戰勝者，所以我們在和平方面所可採取的行動，祗會有利於他而使盟國沮喪。我們沒有理由去强迫英法兩國在如此條件下　和。我們一旦向英怯提出和平建議，就會使他們陷於錯誤的地位。假使他們接受，他們就必須對希特勒條件的大部份表示同意；假使他們拒絕，就會負起拒絕和平的罪名。</p>
<p>我們不採取行動的決意，並沒有阻止謠言的繼續傳播。我們似乎覺得許多此類的謠言都是來自德國，一部份目的在於使人相信希特勒一向都準備着和平，另一目的就是要把個別和平與侵略謠言使盟國迷惑。</p>
<p>十一月五日，參贊堪克自柏林來電稱：沙赫特表示，假使他獲得總統接見的保證，以便提出他對於解決歐洲糾紛的意見，他願意到美國來進行非政治性的談話。堪克並且報告說他最近注意到完全非官方性質的同樣努力，但是他警告我們不要過份重視，因爲和戰的決定，繼續是在希特勒身上。</p>
<p>在我們看來，沙赫特的行動，似乎是德國政府企圖經由非正式人員與其他政府接觸的整個努力中的一部份。這些非正式人員表面上好像是完全與德政府無關，而在若干方面講，他們還是反對德國政府。</p>
<p>當比王李奧伯突然到海牙去，與荷蘭女王威廉明娜共同斡旋結束戰爭的時候，戴維斯大使於十一月七日拍電給總統和我，說德國將於十一月九日進攻荷蘭，所以才促成他們的這種行動。荷蘭公使勞登九日來看我，他的情緒很是激動，他把他的政府的照會，　給總統和我，裏面說荷比圍國的中立，將在數天甚至數小時內遭到破讓。十一月十一日，總統電復比王李奧伯與荷蘭女王威廉明鄉，重申他的友誼，但並沒有肯定的表示。</p>
<p>十二月十四日，駐法大使浦立特自巴黎拍來法外交部李加對他講的話。據李加說：壘索里尼企圖促成時機未成熟的和平，以便維持總國的納粹政權，進而保護他木身在義大利的政權。李加以為壘索里尼是要恢復一九三三年義　理所建議的英法德義四强公約的基本原則。</p>
<p>同時，總統與我們討論和梵蒂岡建立關係的計劃。七月初，在戰事爆發前兩個月，章爾斯會與我討論我們從這種關係中所能得到的益處，我們盛覺到梵蒂岡具有許多方而的消息，尤其是關於在德·義·西（西班牙）方面所發生的事情，而這些消息，是我們所沒有的。經我建議之後，韋爾斯寫了一封私人信給駐羅馬的美大使費里浦，徴求他的意見。七月十九”費里浦的覆函建議建立外交關係，並委派新教徒擔任美方代表。韋爾斯將此函交給總統。</p>
<p>在與總統談話中，我力言我們不能遣派正式大使到梵蒂岡去，而祗能遣派總統私人代表與教皇洽商。我贊成費里浦的建議，這位代表應該是一位新教徒。英國遵循程序，委派新教徒擔任駐梵蒂岡的公使，另委天主教徒一人任公使館內的一等秘書。我又說假使他採取此一步驟，他將同時獲得其他教會美國領袖的同樣合作。　駐羅馬的費里浦大使於九月廿五日拍電給我，範是梵蒂岡「羅馬觀察報」對於總統向國會提出的中立咨文，已予以充分和客觀的紀載。我把原電送呈總統參考。</p>
<p>然後在十月二日，總統以很長的備忘錄送給我。備忘錄開頭就說：「這是本人剛剛想到的見解，沒有和別人討論過。他預料在戰爭結束之後，無論是很快，或是另一夏天，或是三年五年，將產生大量的難民，包括基督徒與猶人，來自各國，甚至於連英，法，義也在其內。</p>
<p>總統繼續說：「因爲這綠故不知你我是否應在戰爭進行時，就開始考慮到與梵蒂岡，美　教會聯合會，以及歐洲方面同樣性質的機構，討論整個問題，與猶人的接觸，業已經由密朗泰來委員會予以實現。</p>
<p>「但是與天主教的接觸，應該直接以梵蒂岡本身爲對象，因爲這一問題對歐洲天主教的重要性，要比對美國天主教的重要性要大得多了。　「因此，我以爲雖然沒有倉忙從事的特殊理由，我們或者可以考慮在以後遣派一位前赴梵蒂岡的特別公使或大使，以便我們可以對歐洲天主教難民問題，具有）種直接通訊的系統。」</p>
<p>在他的備忘錄內，總統建議遣派外交代表到教皇那裏，完全是根據難民問題。關於梵蒂岡可以成爲獲致和平的因素一點，他並沒有提及，雖然道一點以後對他是極爲重要的。</p>
<p>十月十日，他以另一備忘錄給我，內容是關於費里浦大使報告「羅馬觀察報」刊載總統致國會的中立咨文一事。羅斯福先生說：由於各種原因，我以爲你不妨依照下面的意思，拍一電報給費里浦：「閣下有便時，請向教延外交部長說明。總統對於「羅馬觀察報」用公正的態度發載美國消息，表示愉快。」我照此意於十月十一日致電給費里浦，十月二十日，即接獲他的復電稱：教察對總統的電文，表示欣慰。</p>
<p>梵蒂岡方面的宣傳進行了數星期之後，我在十二月廿三日打電報給費里浦，把總統致教皇的聖誕函件內容告訴他。此一函件將於第二天公開發表，同時並由總統宣佈戴樂被委爲遣赴梵蒂岡的代表。原函是經由紐約總主教史班爾曼（現在是紅衣主教）轉交駐在華盛頓的數宗代表。總統復以同樣的函件致給美國基督教會同盟理事會會長新教領袖白待里克，及美國猶太神學院院長艾達拉。戴樂的任命，沒有再比他更適當的了。他具有廣泛的智慧　不平凡的知識。除了梵蒂岡的工作以外，他在我們發起與推動世界和平機構大綱的工作中，也成爲一個活躍的一員。</p>
<p>戴樂於一九四〇年二月啓程赴歐，而我們與梵蒂岡的新關係，也就此開始。對於歐洲和平問題，教宗似乎與我們具有同樣的現實見解。他決心不提出解決辦法，除非可以獲致永久性的和平。在德國未瓦解前這種時機是不會到來的。</p>

<h3>客中潦倒　歲暮途窮　文化人痛名譽破產　法庭上吞毒藥求死　胡迪亞未離險境病榻上詳談經過</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕中華聯合新聞社編輯主任胡迪亞，被該社副社長朱海屛控有竊盜罪嫌，昨在地檢處開庭偵訊聘，胡因名譽方面蒙受影響，且受經濟壓迫，竟當庭吞服甘汞自殺，由地檢處念送廣慈醫院診治，經醫師用　灌救，因甘汞沉重，仍在腸中未出，截至發稿時止，尙未脫離險境。　記者昨騙車至廣慈醫院，訪問此一自殺之「同業」，渠臥於廣慈醫院三樓三等病房，着破舊之藏靑色西裝，頭髮蓬鬆，面容淸搜，見記者來，似無限興奮，強支其孱弱身軀，叙述渠被控竊盜與自殺經過。</p>
<p>首先　渠出示記者一「中華，聯合新聞社職員證」卡片，內面寫「胡迪亞，二十六歲，四川，編輯主任，社長章蒼萍」，以表明自己之身份。繼稱：「我係上海法學院報業科畢業，抗戰時該校在萬縣，去年七月來滬謀職業，因章過去在萬縣上海法學院任敎，渠此時兼任中華聯合新聞社社長，遂介紹入該社充任編輯主任，惟該社職員甚少，內中僅有編輯主任及繕寫鋼板二人，自我入該社工作迄現在爲止，約計六個月，僅僅拿到薪金四百二十六萬元，以致平常即拮据萬分。</p>
<p>其後　章蒼萍返原籍競選，社務由副社長宋海萍負責，宋亦在該社內（虬江支路十弄四十二號）居住，因發稿問題，發生誤會，宋竟對我印象不好，我亦思赴漢口另謀工作，向宋借旅費二百萬元，宋未允借，遂請將社中儲藏之舊報紙出售，以售款作爲旅費，宋亦不允。我因流落異鄉，舉目無親，吿貸無門，遂於本月三日上午趁宋不在社內時，將社內所存之舊白報紙一百零八斤，土報紙五十八斤半，裝一三輪車運出，賣得二百十三萬元，下午返社，笑着對宋說：「對不住，我巳把舊報紙賣了」。</p>
<p>豈料　宋此時板起面孔，打電話給警察局，報我竊盜，由武進路派出所將吾轉解虹口警察分局，本月四日由虹口分局移解地檢處，檢察官訊問結果，以情形並不若何餒重，准許交保。我於交保後，不能離開上海另謀工作，名譽方面受到損失，而囊空如洗，中華聯合新聞社又不能再去居住，遂假小旅社住宿，正値舊歷年關，滿街塲鼓聲喧，益增刺激，決心自殺，先乃以騐血爲由，請醫生抽血一管，作血書四封，一致新聞記者公會，三函分致申，新，大公三報，報吿事實經過，希我死後名譽能得保持，此四封血書刻存於地檢處，又買甘汞（水銀劑一塊，預備必要時作自殺之用。</p>
<p>今日　（十二日）上午地檢處復傳我及宋到庭訊問，當庭檢察官　知和解，我以縱使和解，名譽已受損失，且和解以後，生活亦無着落，頓感人生乏味，遂在地檢處吞服預購之甘汞，決心自殺，經法警發覺後，車送廣慈醫院急救，此即被控竊盜與自殺之經過。」胡因談話時間稍長，呼吸迫促，至結束時從袋中挖出法幣一萬五千元，苦笑着說：「我身上僅剩這個數目了！」記者走出廣慈醫院時，看見大上海正浴在爆竹與　鼓的新春氣氛裏，誰想到在另一角落裏，爲了「二百萬元」，正演着這一幕悲劇呢？</p>
<h3>田耕莘昨抵滬　參加公教會議</h3>

<h3>盛傳開放長江航行權　輪船業斥為無稽　目為中傷中美邦交惡意宣傳</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕日來盛傳美國援華貸款，將以開放長江航行權爲附帶條件，全國輪船業聯合會負責人談此爲無稽謠言，且斥爲中傷中美邦交之惡意宣傳。據稱：「美國對於其本國航業，向來採取高度保護政策，此項政策，在近十年中，曾迭經加强，用於造船之款項，常佔全國歲出之主要部份，其沿岸及內河航行，均限於懸掛美國旗之船舶，故美國政府及人民對於我人爲維護沿海及內河航行權，與反對長江「四口通商」之奮鬥，最能了解而贊助。此種友情與正義，早已嬴得中華民族之共鳴，現値共匪猖獗，咸脅世界和平之際，我人更亟需乎美國精神上及物質上各種援助之及時實現，以解除當前之禍患。此種援助乃出於守望相助，共策安全之立塲，必無交換條件之可言。特別是四萬萬五千萬人對於中國收回不久之航權，彌切珍愛之情。我國政府當局，亦曾屢次聲明絕無變更保護政策之可能，當爲各友邦所週知。故目前所盛傳之開放長江航行權，使懸掛外國旗之船舶，得以長驅直入一節，殊無跡象可尋，其爲少數人企圖在華重享航行特權所製造之空氣，以淆惑視聰，當可斷言，吾人惟有益加警惕，以確保航權之完整。」</p>
<h3>服用國貨協會　特約商號優待</h3>

<h3>舞國紅星　意興闌珊　孫洪元等兩理事長　農歷除夕恢復自由　涉嫌舞女等將移地檢</h3>
<p>舞女及舞業職工搗毀社會局事件警局偵訊中舞業公會理事長孫洪元及舞業職工會理事長唐宗傑經舞廳同業及陳霆銳律師之連續請求，業於十日晨前二時許（即舊曆大除夕深夜）獲警局允准，各交殷實舖保一家保出。至無業職工會另一理事胡運源及涉嫌較重之舞女七名，職工二十五名，即將移送地檢處審理，屆時交保中之孫洪元·唐宗傑。及舞女代表孫致敏·金美紅·孟燕等均將應傳到庭受審。據記者探悉，自搗毀事件發生後，各舞廳之紅星，咸有夕陽無限好之感，未返舞塲恢復其貨腰生涯者甚多，即以代表舞女請願團而馳譽舞苑如孟燕·孫致敏之流，亦咸不復原來舞廳，並秘其行跡，儼然舞國隱逸，一反過去活躍情形，故舞廳雖臨春節期中，營業並不甚盛云。</p>
<h3>申新廠被捕工人　百九十八名開釋　楊光明胡賓良　承認加入共黨　尙有卅八名嫌疑重大正繼續偵訊</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕據市政府新聞處昨日發表：本市澳門路路申新第九廠工潮發生後，當塲逮獲行跡可疑暴動工人二百餘人，其中無辜被累情節較輕之工人一百九十八名，業由申九善後會派代表於九日下午分別覓具妥保，予以開釋，尙有工人三十八名，嫌疑重大，由警察局派員繼續審訊中，其中楊光明，胡寳良兩名，經訊問結果，自認爲共產黨員。其供詞筆錄如下：</p>
<p>楊光明　楊光明於被捕後，經警察局派員訊問，茲覓錄訊間筆錄如下：　姓名：楊光明。</p>
<p>年齡：二十二歲。</p>
<p>籍貫：高郵。</p>
<p>職業：申新九廠銅匠。</p>
<p>住所：申新九廠工房四區十六號。</p>
<p>右被訊問人因申新九廠工潮一案，於本年二月八日在警察局預審庭訊問紀錄如左：</p>
<p>問：申新九廠這次工潮是誰發動的</p>
<p>答：申新九廠這次工潮，先要說發生原因就是爲了廠方有兩期的配給物品停發了，聽說各部份都曾向廠方交涉，就是我楊光明也曾向工會理事長茅玉庭要求過，並無答覆，銅匠間的朋友，都知道的。過了一個冬禮拜，工會和廠方均無答覆，所以才發生了這次風潮。申新九廠的部門太多，各部門均有代表參加，如譚錫寳，還有一位細紗間的面孔認識，名字我說不出了，差不多有代表一百多人哩。</p>
<p>問：你可知道這次工潮組緻的內容嗎？</p>
<p>答：選舉代表的是譚錫寳他們主張的，領導糾察隊的是楊長敏，我是代表說話的。這在關車以後，在準備向廠方第一次交涉談判，有一位王仲良，向大家代表要求全體去向廠方商談</p>
<p>問：爲什蠻演變到關鐵門不准出入呢？這是誰卞張　？</p>
<p>答：關車的當天晚間即是你們警察沒有到的前二天，正在我們和廠方談判的時候，忽有一位自稱新聞記者來到申新九廠，我們是非常歡迎的，結果因爲這位自稱新聞記者行動神秘，並無採訪的準備，所以大家要看他的身份證，正爭執間，後面忽有一位舉出手槍來示威，於是工友們嘩然異常，當由工友楊長敏將他的槍奪下拖到廠裏去，結果聽說楊長敏曾向普陀路分局去報過。據說這自稱新聞記者的是普陀分局派來的，所以才關了鐵門，非經查明身份不能隨便進去，這就是一位姓金的主張的，名字不十分淸楚，面孔還認得。</p>
<p>問：當天下午軍警及關係當局來和你們談話，是誰反對派代表出來談判的？</p>
<p>答：聽過各方面長官的指導，我們工方的代表楊長敏，當時曾爬越鐵門，打算出來談判的，但是人聲嘈雜，一部份工人反對，因而未果。</p>
<p>問：誰設計鄭石磚洒硝鏹水自來水打軍警呢？</p>
<p>答：這情形我不知道，也許楊長敏他們知道。</p>
<p>問：誰導演勞資戲劇敎唱歌的，你知道嗎？</p>
<p>答：這我不十分詳細。</p>
<p>問：你曾參加過什麼團體？</p>
<p>答：過去在重慶較塲口事件發生後，由一位郭楚槐先生介紹我加入中國共產黨，最近也曾和王仲良他們一百六十位結拜過弟兄，其他沒有參加過什麼團體。</p>
<p>問：你在甫慶參加共產黨，到上海來做工，是用什麼方法和他們速絡呢</p>
<p>答：我是在卅五年七月閒來上海的，是向福州路勞動協會去報到，並向勞動協會說明我是現在服務申新九廠。差不多過了一個多月，就有一位王毅明先生到申新九廠來看我，當時他（指王）指示我和工友們要和氣，在工友間如有較好的朋友，儘量發展同志關係，以後每一週見面一次。</p>
<p>問：申新九廠工潮發生，你最近一次和王毅明見面是在什麼地方，他可約你下次見面的時間和地點嗎？</p>
<p>答：最近一次是在二禮拜前，約在西摩路霞飛路口電車站頭和王毅明見面的，他約我下次見面的地點，是康腦脫路膠州路四角，時間就是明天（九號）下午三時，上下不過三分鐘，一定見面的。</p>
<p>問：王毅明的身材是什麼樣子？</p>
<p>答：身材比我矮一點，並不胖，也不瘦，不戴眼鏡。穿學生裝，講本地口音。</p>
<p>問：王毅　對你可曾指示過工作要領嗎？</p>
<p>答：工作上並沒有什麼指使，不過他向我問問，申新九廠最近的情形，並且向我談談最近共產黨軍的戰况，以及這次學生爲了港九事件的遊行，完全是愛國運動，政府這一味的壓迫實，在遺憾！</p>
<p>問：你進申新九廠做工，是誰介紹的？</p>
<p>答：我進申新九廠是我姊夫梅文奎介紹給申新廠丁部長的</p>
<p>問：妳姊夫梅文奎現在那裏？</p>
<p>答：他（指梅）也在申新九廠做銅匠，是勝利後和我一齊進廠，他（指梅）是丁部長的親戚。</p>
<p>問：你進申新九廠後，發展到幾位同志關係？</p>
<p>答：我們發展同志關係，是須要以下的條件：</p>
<p>（一）要識字，（二）要溫和，（三）要認識社會，（四）要了解國際形勢，（五）要能保守秘密，種種的條件，合乎標準的太少，所以直至最近二個月前，才發展到一位胡寳良同志。</p>
<p>問：發展到胡寳良一位同志，你可向王毅明說明過嗎？胡寳良塡過入黨書嗎？或自願書？</p>
<p>答：胡寳良寫過自願書，我巳經轉交給王毅明了。　問：王毅明可曾和胡寳良見過面嗎</p>
<p>答：還沒有見面，王毅明也沒有約過他。</p>
<p>胡賓良　姓名：胡寳良，廿四歲，無錫，申新九廠銅匠間工人。住址：四區工房十六號。</p>
<p>問：你爲什麼參加共產黨呢？</p>
<p>答：因我們銅匠間代表楊光明勸導我，呌我參加的。</p>
<p>問：你在何時參加的？</p>
<p>答：我在半個月前。</p>
<p>問：你加入共產黨時，楊光明有什麼東西交給你？</p>
<p>答：楊光明交給我自傳要點一紙，呌我在半月內寫好交給他，就可加入共產黨。</p>
<p>間：你現在有無將自傳交給楊光明呢？</p>
<p>答：我因意思不懂，由楊光明先在我自傳紙上寫好要點，我依要點寫好一篇自傳，交給楊光明，楊光明當時遂認爲可以了，故將自傳發還我。</p>
<p>問：有無其他手續？</p>
<p>答：沒有。</p>
<p>問：這里用鉗筆寫的自傳要點一張，是否是楊光明寫給你的？</p>
<p>答：是楊光明寫起交給我的。</p>
<p>問：這幾張用洋墨水寫的自傳，是你自己親手寫的嗎？</p>
<p>答：是我自己親手寫的，在半月前</p>
<p>問：你交自傳在什麼地方呢？</p>
<p>答：本廠放工後在四區工房十六號　室裏交給他看的。</p>

<h3>公共水陸交通　輸車新價核定　輸渡小火車昨日已調整　電車公共汽車定十五實行</h3>
<p>本市本月份公共交通事業電車，公共汽車，小火車及輪渡等價格，日前經市公用局趙局長曾珏暨各宇管處室科人員會同參議會公用組召集人姜豪，在竹一，唐承宗等三參議員運用公用事業自動調整公式，根據上月份各項有關指數，縝密核計，擬定應行調整價格，並由趙局長面呈市長批准，輸渡小火車重新價昨起已實行，其餘電車與公共汽車，則定於十五日起實行，茲將新價列後：</p>
<p>電車：三等二千元至七千元頭等四千元至一萬一千元較</p>

<h3>春節前奏曲　塔爾寺花燈　盛會暫停開</h3>
<p>〔本報蘭州八日航訊〕西北各地的人民，對於過廢曆新年，興趣牢不可拔，政府乃照中央農民節的規定，擴大舉行，日前已由社會處召開過一個警備會，決議各機關，學校，團體及民商各戶，於是日一律懸旗誌慶，行轅及省府放假一天，並由市農會及發動市民在二月廿四，廿五，廿六表演社火三天，由農業改進所，農校，民敎館，獸疫防治處，羊毛改進處，科學敎育館等機關，籌備農產農且展覽會，及各種耕作競賽，向各劇院，影院於廿五，廿六兩日免費招待農民觀劇等。</p>
<p>另一個意義重大的措施，便是春節勞軍，也由社會處發動，除勸募捐款外，還印製春聯義賣，每付最低三十萬元，籌募慰勞金的目標是十億元。昨日甫經議決，甘肅省銀行即首先捐獻五千萬元，甘肅貿易公司捐獻三千萬元，蘭州市銀行也捐獻二千萬元，其他工商實業銀行界，均紛紛輸將，義賣的春聯現正漏夜趕印，省農會柴理事長若愚已以一百五十萬元，預購最先出版的三付，目前勞軍工作，正如火如茶的熱烈展開。</p>
<p>提倡節約，禁止饋贈聲中，本市某報上發現了「春節大比賽」的大廣吿，細讀下去，是「本店爲謀出品精良，新近由滬聘到新型技師，專製南糖，餅乾，點心，麵包及各種年糕，新設餅乾機器，科學焙爐，耗費數億，意在達到改良成功，準備歲末食品大比賽，尙祈……」云云，早在半月之前，當局在紙面上循例的「禁止鐀贈」一番，可是表現在事實上的，不但是食品店舖的櫉窗裏，贈品高如山積，而且還有人發動製造饋贈品「大比賽」，藉示提倡，這是不是有意的諷刺？有人在報紙上主張由警憲在街頭沒收禮品，轉贈榮軍和平民，意思是蠻好的，其如「行不顧言」何？</p>
<p>花燈不舉行　祝戡亂完成</p>
<p>一年一度的塔爾寺上元花燈盛會，今年來暫停開放。據記者向有關方面獲得確息：本年元宵，轉瞬即屆，該寺活佛等按照宗敎儀式，須於事前在佛前求卦，以決定本年燈會的籌備事宜。卜卦結果，以本年燈會，須注重於祈禱諷經，至酥油燈會，不必大規模的舉辦。本此旨意，諸活佛等亦因去年該寺派僧出外化緣，所得佈施不多，且以國家連年遭受日寇及共匪戰亂影饗，國民經濟均感拮据，故遵照國家節約消費的意志，一致贊成將該寺本年上元節酥油花燈大會，予以從簡舉行。祗於是日在大經堂供奉小規模的燈會，由僧衆虔誠誦經，以祈禱戡亂早日成功，國內早日得到和平統一。至如往年擺設的酥油燈大花架，一概暫行停止，以符合國府節約的意志。該寺所派活佛代表及管家等，日前赴西寗向當局陳述一切，靑海省政府亦因該寺的花燈盛會，旣經由活佛等卜卦決定，不但於宗敎意義不背，且對此消費節約，祈禱和平統一之舉，甚表贊同。故該寺堪布廳發言人，已對外正式宣佈：「每年上元花燈，係事前在佛前虔誠禱告後卜噬決定。本年經卜卦指示：以舉行小規模燈會及擴大諷經祈禱爲原則，當經大衆遵奉佛旨，擬自古正月初四起，在本寺大經堂舉行佛事，謂講經典　，祈禱戡亂成功，按之教規，其意義尤勝於大設花燈。」</p>
<p>欲遊塔爾寺　須知宗喀巴</p>
<p>凡到過西北的人，必以一臨塔爾寺爲榮，而每年上元節的酥油花燈大會，尤爲盛大，且名震遐邇，所以每屆會期，凡屬信仰人士，多自數千里外，前往膜拜，以表虔誠，而國內外羨慕該寺建築的壯麗宏偉，響往酥油花燈的製造精巧的，亦不惜遠道跋涉，以一覩斯盛爲快。</p>
<p>塔爾寺是什麼時候落成的？它何以有這樣大的魔力能吸收千千萬萬的人？要解答這些問題，不能不從宗喀巴大師的生平說起。</p>
<p>宗喀巴大師，於明洪武廿六年（癸酉）十月二十五日，誕生於靑海西寗城西南二十九公里的塔爾寺原址，其時此處是宗喀巴家庭的游牧駐地，其父利本格，母名香沙阿切，大師降生後，剪臍的血滴在地上，次年便生出紫檀樹一株，各葉顯有獅子吼佛像，計有十萬。（藏名貢本）於是遠近人士，以爲非凡，前來朝拜的，日益衆多。因湟水藏名宗曲，遂將大師命名為宗喀巴。</p>
<p>大師在三歲時，便異常靈慧，就師於朶麻繞耶多結。七歲時，又從多任寳切爲師，並出家受沙彌戒，深研佛法。十七歲時，大師因鑒於當時佛敎僧徒，漸趨異端，且敎律腐敗，敎規蕩然，乃具改革的決心，毅然以佛敎的馬丁路　爲已任，遂赴西藏深造，在藏親建朶丹寺一座，改創新敎，佾徒均著黃衣黃冠，於是人即稱爲黃敎。大師在藏宣揚佛法，至成化十五年（己亥）十月二十五日圓寂，享年七十有五。</p>
<p>感於大師恩　興建塔爾寺</p>
<p>自宗喀巴大師赴藏後，至明永樂年間，地方人士，爲感念大師，在紫檀樹旁，建立寳塔一座，上設佛龕，內供大師金像，以作遠近人士朝拜之所，即今之大金瓦寺。其後逐漸擴充，計有小金瓦寺，大小經堂等一百零八寺，及無數僧寮佛舍，櫛比山溝，至爲整潔，靑海白各大呼圖，均建有駐錫之尕日瓦，靑海省政府，也設有招待遊客的館舍，第十世班禪大師，也駐錫在半山坡的「昂謙院」裏。</p>
<p>酥油燈齊放　信徒皆膜拜</p>
<p>每年上元節之夜，塔爾寺必獻放酥油花燈一次，以酥油（Butter）彫塑出佛像，山水，宮殿，花卉，飛禽，走獸等，加上顏色，栩栩如生。於每年中秋節後即開始塑造，其方法秘不示人，待至上元節黃昏，分數處展出，以爲競賽，燈棚搭於大經堂附近，高達三丈餘，兩邊均爲五彩絲繡的各種佛敎故事和岡案，綴以瓔珞流蘇，極爲燦爛。棚頂上懸掛着數十盞玻璃花燈，棚的前方設木架二個，矗起三角形的大牌坊，酥油彫塑的佛像物品，都嵌在牌坊上。其下排成三列黃銅小燈，約二三百盞。明月初升後，數百盞油燈燃着，發出淡黃的光熖，映照着上邊彩色酥油塑成的物品，宛如一幅富麗堂皇的立體風景畫，生動異常，使看的人如夢如幻，信徒們則五體投地，頂禮膜拜。</p>
<p>過了子夜，酥油像和燈統統撤去，次日天明，不留一點燈會的痕跡。據傳獻放花燈的意義，是宗喀巴大師一個夢境的再現，所以天明後空無所有。也有人說是大師顯示極樂世界的景况，以堅定信徒們的虔誠信心。但據敎中人的解釋，是紀念釋迦牟尼佛，當年與婆羅門敎，爲爭信仰而彼此鬥法，自正月初一日起，至正月十五日止，將婆羅門敎鬥勝，所以後來的徒弟們，便在每年正月十五日獻放花燈一次，以紀念最後的勝利。（本報記者宋麟）</p>

<h3>春節在杭州　卜命運？遊山水？</h3>
<p>〔本報杭州十一日訊〕春節前，從上海開到杭州來的車子，車廂裏擠得水洩不通，有的人竟從車窗裏爬進去？有的竟爬在車皮上，小小的車中厠所也擠滿了人，路局雖然加了還鄉專車，但還是沒有辦法疏散這樣多的人口。機杭州車站的站長潘銘兄吿訴我，春節前幾天，每天由上海到杭州來的客人總有四萬人，每天由杭州到上海的不過四千人，車上的查票員也無法挿足，三等的跑入了頭等，頭等的客人反在三等裏容身也覺滿意了。記得去年杭州春季香汛，，空前的熱閙，得天由上海到杭州來的不過一萬一千多人，前年的還鄕車也不過每天兩萬多人，今年却擊破了以往的紀錄。這爲什麼？這是艱難的歲月折磨着在外鄕奮鬥的遊子，他們祈求着片刻的安慰，須臾的溫暖，在舉世茫茫遍地冷酷的今天，只有回到家裏，吻吻慈母的白髮，抱抱年幼的孩子，親親熟悉的鄉土，這才算是唯一的慰藉了。</p>
<p>一天好太陽　普照西子湖</p>
<p>春節到了，難得一天好太陽普照在西子湖演，從早上六點鐘開始到晚上九點鐘，各條馬路上，尤其是湖濱路上的男男女女，熙熙攘攘，眞是肩摩踵接，脚踏車行裏的脚踏車租光了，出差汽車一車車的載着人到靈隱或是南山去，有些卡車，臨時擺了幾條板櫈，兜搭着人們環湖遊覽。人羣中，一半以上是從鄕下來的，他們穿得紅紅綠綠，新的衣裳和新的鞋襪，他們虔誠地度着這農曆的新歲。賣玩具的人沿街兜賣，價錢要比平時高出兩倍，黃包車，三輪車的價錢也要高出一倍，西子湖裏的划子，由湖濱載到中山公園，每人要兩萬元，這些買買只要在嘴裏「發財發福」的口彩下，雇主是毫無考盧的樂予接受的。</p>
<p>北山岵天竺爭着烧頭香</p>
<p>在這個年頭，「發財」，當然還是一件了不起的喜事，在世事，國事，家事，人事紛紛動亂下，艱難困苦緊壓在每一個人的心頭，只有祈求着神靈的庇佑。北山的三天竺，春節中熱閙的情形，遠勝於去年的春訊，單談燒頭香，就有幾百個人，以後天竺道上，車馬紛紛，天竺寺裏的香烟繚繞過了屋頂。燒香的人，他們默默地禱吿，企求着有求必應，大慈大悲的觀世音菩薩降福於他們！他們求着籤，每個人都希望得一個「上上」。</p>
<p>上天竺的本院，山門外的彌陀在不甚輝煌的屋子裏，和尙們趁着人們有求於菩薩的時候，他們也伸出手來，向善男信女們有所要求。因着希望菩薩多賜宏福，所以也就樂善好施了。</p>
<p>金華將軍廟　蠟燭拔不盡</p>
<p>湧金門金華將軍廟更甚熱閙，在廟裏擠得無以復加，香客們還　向廟裏擁着，剛剛挿上去的蠟燭，爲了另一個人。又來朝拜而拔了卞來，另一個人又因爲如此而又拔了下來，七八對斗圍的大蠟燭燒燃得通明光亮。道士們想出了方法，臨時在馬路上把香燭，紙元寳等堆成一個十攤十，點燃了起來，火光融融，兩旁圍觀與燒香的人擠寒了這一條偌大的馬路。據傳金　將軍爲明代大將，因守城殉難，後人崇爲夭神，據謂是執掌財源的，所以求財的爭先恐後，又傳金華將軍穎異非凡，右求必應。春節中去求金華將軍的，有鄉村中的男女，右城市中時髦的姑娘，都要求賜財福於他們。城隍山上，也是最爲熱鬧的，那裏有十殿閣羅，　管着每一個人的命運，所以每個人都得到閻羅那裏去膜拜，尤其對那閻羅旁邊的小鬼，更要小心伺候，隨便人世是如何的悲涼，但終究迷戀這人世的人多於厭惡這人世的人，在換天乏術之下，用神怪玄秘來寄托自己的身世。雖然這已是千百年來的產物，但戰亂不已的中國，又有什麼方法可以使他們趨於別途呢？　城隍山上的相士，也乘機而動，用可以斷定你的一身禍福爲號召，果然來求敎的人趨之　驚。</p>
<p>玉皇山等處遊人亦如鯽</p>
<p>其他如王　山，六和塔，虎跑泉等地，亦是遊人如鯽，但總不及天竺，金華將軍廟，城隍山之盛。在這新春時節，到底卜命運的人，要比遊山射水的人多得多了。一位杭州老鄕笑着吿訴我說：「你看，春天已經來了，楊柳梢頭已經在綠了，春梅已經在開了，桃花已經有花朶了，今年的香汎由於春節還鄕的啓示，要比去年更熱鬧。」是的，你看那名勝區的寺院，湖濱的商店，都正在抖擻起精神，迎接他們愉快而做好生意的日子。（本報特派員儲裕生）</p>

<h3>赫爾回憶錄　（十八）</h3>
<p>— 北美報業聯合會版權所有　本報編譯室</p>
<p>此　此刻談和平等於自殺</p>
<p>一九四〇年夜十時五十分，我公寓中的電話　了，駐布魯塞爾大使柯達希，用激動動　聲音吿訴我說，大批德國空軍正越過盧森堡，飛到比利時來，據說荷蘭上空也右出現。柯達希還吿訴我說，太批德軍正在比利時·盧森堡和荷蘭邊境集中，比利時方面預料德軍大致將於黎明進攻。</p>
<p>我打電話給總統，吿訴他柯達希給我的消息，其後再打電話給國務院中的幾個同僚。我在剛過十一點鐘不久之後到辦公室，比共他的人稍早一些。我立即打電話到歐洲幾個重要首都去。當我和柯達希接通時，他吿訴我盧森堡已被侵入，德國飛機正在轟炸布魯寒爾附近的飛機塲，德軍似乎準備同時進攻，比利時·荷蘭和盧森堡。</p>
<p>但是比德軍進攻比·荷·盧成功更凶險的消息，就是蒲立特大使在五月十五日打給總統和我的電報，其中說，德軍以大量的坦克部隊和俯衝轟炸機爲前導，業已在色當突破法軍防綫。雷諾總理打電話給邱吉爾說，德軍旣已突入，戰爭在幾天之中則將無可挽救。照雷諾的意思，除非英國立即派它的戰鬥機隊從聯合王國到法國來戰爭　完了。邱吉爾答應把這個遠見戰內時內閣提出，但是堅決向電　說，戰爭不會無可挽救。雷諾回答說，邱吉爾應該知道，在雷諾担任總理的時候，法　是誓必作戰到底的。</p>
<p>同日，五月十五日，肯奈蒂大使打電報給總統和我，吿訴我們他剛才和邱吉爾所作的一次聳人聽聞的談話。首相說，假如義大利參戰，他認爲協約國獲勝　機會是微乎其微的了。邱吉爾說法國正在要求派更多　軍隊去，但是他不願意在此時此亥從英國派人出去，因爲他深信在一個月之內英國即將，　受激烈的進攻了。邱吉爾還說他想要我們出借舊驅逐艦三四十艘，以及我們可以多餘下來的任何飛機。</p>
<p>總統和我對這一點毫無疑義，就是協約國的勝利，對於美國的安全係屬必要。　總統就此項問題迅速加以檢討，當即決定收集每一架可以動用的戰機運到法國去。五月十四日，蒲立特打電報給我，獻議由法國派遣航空母艦一艘前來載運。我和總統商談之後，即於次日回電說，由於國際公法的規定以及美國的地位，在紐約裝運這些飛機勢不可能，但是可以先把它們飛到加拿大的東海岸某港，可能是哈里法克斯，然後再在那裏裝運。這一點是照辦了——但是已經來不及運到法國了。</p>
<p>總統知我並且充份明瞭了一點，就是德軍在以閃電姿態佔領荷蘭和突破色當中所表示的優勢，需要我們在重振美國武裝方面　正全部估計。總統和我商量向國會提出一個特別咨文的計劃，要求將該年份的軍用撥款事實上增加一倍，此點我完全贊同。五月十三日，蒲立特打電　給我，要求轉給總統，其中力言由於飛機在德軍推進，所起的重要作用，實有增加飛機　產必要。於是我就向總統建議美國應以每年生產飛機五萬架為目標。其前，我已向我的同僚提起過這個數字。細斯福先生的反應和我同僚的反應相同—他節直默然無言，因五萬架飛機比諸目前每年的生產量，達十倍之多。、但是我力爭說，如能定一個較大的數字和遠大的目標，最爲相宜。這樣的生產量，在我看來並不像對於其他人看來那樣不可能。我覺得單是提起這個數字再加上我國舉世所知的龐大生產能力，對於激發我國自己的人民，安慰協約國以及使軸心國有所顧慮，已足以產生良好的影響。</p>
<p>總統繼即表示同意。五月十六日，在致國會的咨文中，他說他希望全國加緊生產，以期每年生產飛機五萬架。他要求追加武裝部隊各部門的撥款，總額達十一億八千二百萬美元　繼而，雷諾總理開始向總統發出一連串異乎尋常的，幾乎是歇斯的里性的呼籲法總狎顯然爲德軍驚人的勝利所震驚和激動，此點頗易設想。但是他要求的是不可能的。　五月十八日，法國外交部秘書長萊傑通知蒲立特大使說，雷諾擬於那天晚上向總統提出個人的呼籲，詢問羅福先生是否可能從國會得到對德宣戰。蒲立特打電報給總統和我說，他曾答覆萊傑，認爲這種呼籲不惟無用，抑且有更惡劣的結果，總統不會要求國會對德宣戰，國會幾乎會）致反對宣戰的。蒲立特率直地指出，假如雷諾一定要提出這樣一個呼籲，也不過純粹是記錄性質的束西，將來有一夭雷諾希望可以表明他曾向美國總統提出呼籲，一向總統則加以拒絕而已。蒲立特向萊傑說，這種辦法，在他看來不但對英法甚至對美國都太不値得，而當前的情形又太嚴重，三國政府間除了坦白相處之外，實不宜從事徒有其表的事情。</p>
<p>總統和我同意蒲立特向萊傑所作的答覆，是反映我們的見解的。</p>
<p>那天晚上，蒲立特親自去見雷諾，雷氏說他想向我們提出一個正式的照會。</p>
<p>蒲立特把他的意見吿訴我們，認為雷諾並沒有把這樁事情想出一個辦法，已經決定送一假照會來作爲一種記錄。這個決定，曾因那天下午蒲立特和萊傑的談話而加以阻止的。　在總統和我討論雷諾和蒲立特的談話之後，總統就和蒲立特通電話，吿訴他說這一類性質的事情是談不到的。蒲立特當即向雷諾轉達。</p>
<p>五月二十二日，蒲立特再打電報給總統和我，說雷諾吿訴他他不　讓這樁事情擱置不管。這在現在，已較四日前他最後一次討論這件事情的時候，更有重大關係了。法國已從義大利和瑞典接到消息說，假如德國在法國北部的現行戰役中再獲得一次重大的勝利，希特勒擬向法國提出一個單獨的和寬大的和平。</p>
<p>雷諾說，假如希特勒在法國國內極度失望之時提出這樣一個建議，法國大衆傾向於接受的危險性極大。雷諾本人承認·這種接受等於自殺，猶如一九三八年捷克斯洛伐克放棄蘇台德區一般。從那時候起，法國將生活在德國的鐵蹄之下，一俟希特勒認爲便當的時候，他就會佔領整個法國猶如他佔領整個捷克斯洛伐克一樣。再者，德國戰勝英國的事情，也將在幾星期內隨之發生。於是雷諾相信在幾個月之中德國兵土和幾千架飛機將到南美洲，巴拿馬運河將遭轟炸，美國軍隊將不能作多少抵抗了。</p>
<p>除了宣戰以外，他認爲美國其他的援助均不足以挽救法國和英國。假如我們不能超過宣戰限度給予軍事援助，我們勢必要在美國對付德國人了。　法國的軍事局勢在迅速惡化中。在法國顯然而互解的情形之下，我在我的辦公室中和同僚舉行了好多次會議，要他們考慮歐洲戰局發展的各種可能性，特別重視它們對美國和西半球的影響。我們得到一個一般的結論，就是協約軍的地位，已經艱難不堪，我們的注意力應集中於保全英法的艦隊，使其不致落入希特勒之手。</p>
<p>總統同意就海軍問題回英法政府提出一個直接呼籲。我們當即起草電報，而於五月二十六日發出。我在致蒲立特的一個電報中說，總統希望他立即向雷諾和達拉第說明一點，就是一方面我們依然希望德軍的侵入能予阻止，但是假如情勢愈演愈劣，我們認爲法國艦隊的保持，對於法國和它殖民地的恢復和海洋的控制，實屬重要，而對於法國獲得較緩和的和平條件，也有重大影響。　我們在致英政府的文吿中，就英國艦隊問題也表示同樣的見解。五月二十日，邱吉爾發電給總統，力言英國所面臨的危險，並且說，假如聯合王國爲希特勒所征服，那麼唯一可以和德國作談判條約就是艦隊。總統在他致邱吉爾的電報中也提及了這一點。他向邱吉爾建議說，假如情勢愈演愈劣，英國艦隊可退至加拿大，並且保證他美國決不准德國或其他任何非美洲國家奪取加拿大或英國其他西半球屬地。祇要英法艦隊能保持完整，德國除了在歐洲境內之外，不能贏得戰爭。</p>
<p>雷諾的呼籲現在變得愈劇烈了。蒲立特於五月二十八日打電報給我們，說明雷諾建議由法國共和國總統和英王向總統發出聯合呼籲。　浦立特看見雷諾的時候，他已經寫好了一句，說：「爲世界向由而作戰的軍隊，已在背上被刺。」</p>
<p>雷諾說，他深知縱使我們於明日向德國宣戰，我們也不能把軍隊空還到法國來，因爲並沒右這種飛機存在。但是我們有艦隊在。大西洋艦隊應立即派到地中海。此一行動至少可以防止另一刺人之背的行動，這一次是從墨索里尼來的·</p>
<p>在英國完成其鄧扣克撤退之後，它向法國表明它不能再派飛機到大陸上來了。英駐法大使對蒲立特說，作戰時飛機的破壞率是如此之高，假如英國派它尙餘的飛機過去，兩星期內將一無所留。目下旣不再有挽救法國甚或法國軍隊的任何希望，似乎還是保留飛機在英國以備應付即將發生的英倫之戰爲上策。　爲響應雷諾幾乎是可憐的呼籲起見，總統敦促邱吉爾派飛機到法國去，但是首相拒絕了。蒲立特對此項決定憤慨異常，而於六月五日向總統和我報吿說，英國可能在保存其空軍和海軍，以謀在和希特勒談判時作爲討價還價的張本。</p>
<p>但是總統和我不以爲然。我們知道法國已經完了，但是我們相信英國在邱吉爾不屈不撓的領導之下，是想繼續作戰的</p>
<p>對德和平條件的思想現在佔據了法國內閣的注意。從蒲立特那裏來的電報愈來愈反映出法國的投降祇是幾天的事了。德軍正向巴黎猛進。六月十日，法國政府遷都多爾。</p>
<p>就在那天，墨索里尼向法國和英國宣戰。</p>

<h3>學齡兒童五千萬　須辦小學百萬班　改善全國師範教育　教部定施政原則</h3>
<p>〔大華社南京訊〕自推行國民教育以後，最感困難者即爲師資缺乏，估計全國共有學齡兒童約五千萬人，如以每班五十人計，至少須辦小學班一百萬班，方可普遍收容。如每班以須用一個半教師計算，至少需教師一百五十萬人，（如兼辦民教班每班以二人計，則須二百萬人）。頃據教育部統計，全國現有國民教師六十五萬人，不論現任教師是否合格，欲普及國民教育，至少補充教師一百萬人。又據教育部統計，如由現有師範學校完成一百萬教師之訓練，則需時三千餘年。積極發展師範教育，並改善其設施，以應實際之需要，實為當前首要之圖。教育部有　於此，特訂定施政原則如左：</p>
<p>畢業師範生　每年五萬人</p>
<p>（一）中央及各省市政府對於中等教育之設施，應時別注重發展師範教育，在師範教育未發展至相當數量時，可暫時限制普通中學之發展。至師範學校發展之數量，至少須使在校師範生與學齡兒童之比例爲一比一百，如全國有學齡兒童五千萬人，則師範生至少須有五十萬人，如每年畢業五萬人，佔所需教師總數百分之十，以之供應新設學校之需要及補充退休死亡教師之缺額，或可免强　角，如此則十年之後國民教師之素質，即可普遍提高。（二）發展師範教育，以廣設師範學校及女子師範學校爲原則，在目前簡易師範仍可普遍設立，至每縣設立一所，以後並逐漸於三年間設法改爲師範學校或女子師範學校，簡易師範修業年限不能短於四年，入學年齡不得小於十五歲。</p>
<p>師生同經營　國教示範區</p>
<p>（三）師範學校及簡易師範課程，仍應斟酌實際需要，加以修訂，師範學校各科教學，均應注重教材教法之研究，及寶習之指導，對於實習尤應特別注重。各師範學校並應劃定區域，作為國民教育實習或示範區，由師生共同經營，藉以增加學生實際辦理國民教育之經驗。（四）師範生在校之特遇，必須改善，除伙食應力求滿足其營義之需要外，並須供給書籍用品制服及其他必要之開支。（五）師範畢業生　一戰前法國之例，至少服務教育十年，不得持任何理由展緩服務。在服務期間，應支國民教育較高之　給，服務至相當年代，如有志　教育行政工作，亦得選拔叙用。</p>
<p>服務五年後　准休假旅行</p>
<p>（六）師範畢業生服務期滿，其服務成績優良有志升學者，得於服務滿五年後免試免費保送升入師範學院，專攻國民教育，畢業後仍限制從事國民教育行政或國民教育事業，但必須比照教育行政人員及中等學校教師支較高　給。其不升學者，於服務滿五年後，准予休假一年，往省外或國外考察研究，休假期間除仍支原薪外，並酌量補助旅費，休假期滿仍回任原職，以後繼續服務，仍每五年休假一年。</p>

<h3>五比一　香港隊大勝利　埠際足球比賽　上海隊遭慘敗　黃毛關熬嚴士鑫失常　陣容散漫張陳邦綸最佳</h3>
<p>〔路透社香港十日電〕今日滬港埠際足球賽，港隊以五比一大勝滬除，上半時港隊以二對一勝，下半時港隊又迎中三球，滬隊缺乏連絡及港方防衛週密爲滬隊失敗主因。張邦綸爲全隊最出色之人，黃毛勞勃斯托夫被港方釘牢，無法施展，孫錦順腿部受傷，下半時甚少活動，港方以鄒文治最爲活躍，滬隊所獲一球，係費春　所中。</p>
<p>〔國光社香港十日電〕港滬埠際足球隊大賽，上海代表隊一行，分別搭乖輪船及飛機分四批來港後，本日在此間舉行，球塲情形，相當熱烈，結果上海隊以一對五受挫，上半時一比二港隊佔先</p>
<p>港隊擁有無將八人，番兵三人，滬隊爲九員　籍戰士，二員番將。鄒文治奪得首功，港隊先報捷音，繼之鄧宜杰亦告命中，至上半時完畢前十分鐘，滬隊由費春華扳回一球，上半時二對一，港除領先。易地後，滬隊全力反攻，奈港隊防禦嚴密，無法深入。八分鐘後，港隊左鋒基尼能冷箭一支，又告中的。未幾吳祺祥禁區闖禍，十二碼由朱永强蹴入，距終塲前五分錡，鄒文洽再建大功，　隊　三對一大勝，奪回埠際大賽銀盃。</p>
<p>是賽港隊控制全局，　聯絡默契，進退快速。上海隊之演出，令人大失所望，動作迂緩，陣容散漫，張邦綸因嚴士　之失常，吳祺祥之大意，門前生意興隆，表演最佳者，僅高保正，韓尼波，及費春華三人而已。</p>
<h3>調整陣容　擊敗華聯</h3>
<p>〔國光社香港十一日電〕上海埠際足球隊，今日來港第二戰，下午與香港聯隊對壘，球迷因滬隊於昨賽演出不够理想，球塲情形，不如第一日之熱鬧。且大部份球迷，於賽前對港隊寄必勝之心，但事實相反。滬隊陣容大加調整，孟義良出任中堅，與高保正競尼波等，搭配默契，嚴士鑫被關熬，以李義臣出任右後衛，祺祥左移，邦綸救出十二碼，咸風八面，前鋒綫上，孫老錦名落深山，夏體先與李垚尚稱默契，費春華活潑玲瓏，表演出色，港隊自調出兩將後，反見陣容散漫，費春華開賽不久，即告中的，滬隊以一對〇佔先於上半時。下半時費春華得李垚之勾球，於門前頭頂中的，以二對〇前導，未幾保正於禁區手球，李碩友主罰十二碼，爲邦綸撲救出險，越十分鏡後，馮景祥不負衆望，扳回一球，茲後雙方陷入拉鋸局面，終塲上海隊以二對一力勝港華聯。滬隊十三日與港西聯隊對壘。</p>

<h3>甲組籃球聯賽　第二循環開始　大公再勝美空軍　六比二九形勢一面倒</h3>
<p>三屆籃球聯賽，自農曆新春休假以來，昨晚仍在市體育館健身房舉行賡續比賽，昨晚天雨，且以農曆新年關係，球迷未見踴躍。三賽結果，首塲甲二組Ｂ億中以五一比卅五輕取Ｖ隊，次幕甲二組Ａ同仁對新生之役，雙方戰來緊張萬分，結果新生賴最後努力，以四七比四六倖勝同仁。末塲甲一組第二循環，大公對美空軍之戰，大公六十二比廿九再勝美空軍。</p>
<p>億中大勝Ｖ</p>
<p>首塲Ｖ隊對億中，Ｖ隊僅到四人，臨時拉舊侶夏厲助陣，勉湊成軍，接觸後，程宣犯規，莊逸榮夏厲相網罰中Ｖ隊即以二比〇前導，億　反攻，董紹唐遠擲近探，先後破籃，金希偉罰球得點，李嘉植董紹唐獲分累累，Ｖ隊頓呈不支，至九比二後，Ｖ隊全力反攻，稍見得手，奈億中緊迫不捨，上半時完畢，億中以廿二比十六領前。易籃再戰，億中節節進退，金希偉董紹唐李嘉植等，迭有破籃，Ｖ隊猶圖反抗，終因億中緊迫不捨，無法深入，僅賴莊逸凱聊以點綴而已。時間終了，億中以五一比卅五輕取Ｖ隊。</p>
<p>同仁負於新生</p>
<p>第二塲伺仁對新生，繼之登塲，新生正規軍未能全部到齊，乃臨時拉雜成軍，接觸後，凌克誠籃下鵠中，同仁首開紀錄，未幾新生徐成富扳成平手，一來一往，相當緊凑，至九比八時，同仁領前，新生緊隨不捨，相差僅一分而已，前半時完畢，同仁以廿二比廿領前一球。休息過後，易地再戰，同仁穩紮穩打，凌克誠連擲帶罰，驟增三分，童延煊兩罰俱入，新生仍然緊迫不捨，同仁全力反抗，一度以廿九比廿二領前，旋又成廿九比廿八接近局面，入後同仁雖全力奮戰，但新生着着緊逼，結果同仁竟以四六比四七負於新生。</p>
<p>大公敗美空軍</p>
<p>末場甲一組第二循環，大公再遇美空軍，大公　文章返厦門未回，由蔡文華　忠强黃柏齡屠文文龍蔡連科出塲，接觸後，忠强罰球開紀錄，美空軍埃力奧擲入，忠强與文華雙管齊下，海克亦告命中，四比五後，空軍一　不振，大公忠強柏齡連科文龍，獲分櫐櫐，空軍雖二度呼停，未見效果，大公乃以廿四對四遙領。空軍鮑勒於千辛萬苦中，獲中一球，大公柏齡忠强雙雙建功，海克一氣呵成五分，前半時適告終了，大公以廿八對十二佔絕對優勢。　易籃後，大公以詹琛調出蔡文華，屠文龍先中，空軍亦有所獲，卅五比十七時，大公首次呼停，雙方形成拉鋸局面，四十比廿四時，空軍調兵遣將，鮑勒海克相當活躍，四十四對廿四時，蔡連科受傷離塲，蔡文華再度出山，此後空軍二次呌停，但難過大公鋒芒，五十一對廿九後，大公連取十一分，結束戰事。笛聲長鳴，大公以六十二比廿九，再克美空軍。</p>

<h3>銀樓恢復飾金賈賣後　金管局將加強管理　飾金價格每兩約一千萬元</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕關於州銀樓業恢復飾金買賣問題，連日報紙均有記載，據金管局方面消息：飾金價格依　　中央規定，係按國行黃金牌價（每兩合美金四十元），加營業費用百分之四十，合法利潤百分之二十，目前綜計每兩値法幣八百六十萬元。工資一項，金管局正與社會局商討中，大約爲按總數再加百分之二十，合計每國約一千萬元。據　管負責人談：銀樓飾金恢復買賣後，將加强對於銀樓業之管理，所有該　帳册，均須於　前　往社會局查核　　，每日庫存及買賣數額，並須報告金管局備查。今後黃金黑市，可望一舉消滅，在嚴格管理政策之下，金價當可獲得合理之安定云。</p>
<h3>新春銀跟過剩　華故由疲轉穩</h3>
<p>款可能拖延至六月中解決之說，人心已反疲回穩。小型股興趣遭銀樓復業所分散，勢甚平庸。銀根過剩，白紗交易多於紅紗，貼價亦步降至一角半，晨開稍穩，永紗以七〇五元及七三五元上塲，一八五號一三七號一八三號一六〇號七一號一八六號八九號進即交，九七號二三二二號一八八號七一號一三四號一六九號進遞交，升至七二五元及七五六元。塲外息價開出仍須三角一分半及三角六，九六號一〇三號二四號一五五號逢高脫手，降爲七二〇元及七五〇元光景。掉期貼便步降，大戶及亨鼠等成向即交中活動。一五七號一六號六九號六五號三五號三六號一七六號一三〇號紛買，漲到即交七三六元，遞交七六五元高價。一八〇號一八五號一〇三號一九七號咸出即交，二二號亦供遞交，午收降爲七二八元及七五六元。小股沉靜如故，套利價退至二五元，僅有一角半鈿，結果較農曆年尾最後收市價計即交股勤興新　商務尚平，中絲中紡微降，信和華　新光景福中怯內衣火柴榮　微升，永紗美亞國貨　安信誼閘北統益各漲半成。遞交股永紗漲半成，新光亦升半成弱，餘均微漲。塲外各未上市股票除公用股稍升外，不過平疲而已。</p>
<h3>套利交易</h3>
<p>昨銀根大爲過剩，有供少求，套利價步降，貼進者由二角二分起，退至一角三分。一部份套利頭寸，被迫移往塲外活動，亨鼠等亦在塲內進白紗，套往塲外。貼價計永妙最爲便宜，自三五元開後，降至二五元收市，新光轉貴，在五元至五元半，美亞等成交少，高價五五元，開收均爲五〇元。信和初開一六華股昨爲春節第二天交易，仍做上午半天。公用事業行將調整價格，西報又有美貸元，自一六元半退至一四元收市</p>
<h3>紅盤補記</h3>
<p>股市春節紅盤開來先堅後疲，九日外匯調整，引起　外刺激，並以銀根過剩而開高盤。永紗以即交七〇〇元，遞交七一七元登傷。內衣中泥且達漲限，塲外開出，高起三十多元。開後九七號三六號七四　進至七一四元及七一二二高價，不久一九一號一五一號一五四號七六號二〇七號九〇號七六號三一號七一號六五號一五二號一五七號連袂供給，塲內爆竹聲聲，交易有限，時斷時續，步降至六九七元及六九八元低價，而後以七〇〇元及七〇二元收市。餘股亦告回落，塲外交易喊價軋攏，相離僅十餘元而已。結果較農曆年尾即交股中泥成交少而漲停，內衣漲停後有回，只升少許。永紗美亞麗安國貨榮盟統益火柴永公微升，信和景福中法新華閘北微挫，華盟新光信誼商務中絲均平。遞交股勤興跌半成，餘均微挫。塲外各未上市股票十九未見做開，勢亦平淡，</p>
<h3>公債外股</h3>
<p>仍在休假中，尚無集會。</p>
<p>昨成交極少，除熱股較爲熱鬧外，雜股寂然無做開人心被圈外刺激所振動，怡紗晨開即躍至六二萬，步升至六五萬收市，較　股見倘甚多。結果較封關前計怡紗漲成半，英聯升一成，怡啤紙版業廣船業各好半成，會德盟鋼業僅告微升。</p>
<h3>商行休假期中　銀根大為鬆動</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕舊曆新年前後，本市銀根先緊後鬆。除夕前國行會大量發出關金及現鈔，爲數約在二萬億左右，市面賴以週轉　活。前昨日銀錢葉仍照常營業，大部份商行則依慣例休假。票據交換數額，爲之銳减，約僅爲平日十分之一，整個金融業入於靜止狀態。昨日銀根仍鬆，現鈔一部份流回國行。計十一日國行差進八十五億，國家行局　進三百三十七億。十二日國行　進六百六十九億，國家行局　進六百五十七億。同業存款以浙江實業與花旗銀行爲多，約爲五百餘億。</p>
<h3>收購廠商物品　約公一千四百餘億</h3>
<p>國家行局代政府收購廠商貨物，自七日截止申請後，所有案件，四聯分處已於八日全部審查竣事，宣告結束。該處正擬具報告中，共核准一百餘件，收購款項共一千四百餘億，各行局已大部放出。九日收購手續，全部辦理完畢。此次收購含有救濟性質，因若千物資，並非政府需要，且不易標售者。標售辦法，四聯總處將另有規定，由中信局經辦，何時標售亦未決定。</p>
<h3>出售政法物資　將另設新機</h3>
<p>關於出售政府物資事，據有關方面悉，無論工業晨　成品或政府產業等，今後不再委託代售。短期內將將成一　機構，以統　辦理出　物資事宜，至人選問題及成立日期，目前尚未確定。</p>
<h3>假期中美匯掛高　場外紗市挺俏</h3>
<p>九日棉紗市塲已正式休業，惟塲外有零邑做開。初做市尚穩定，後聞美匯再度掛高四千，人心頓轉堅俏，四十二支藍　細紗，做高至六千一百五十萬元，較之八日軋升一百萬元。卅二支藍鳳銀月兩牌，亦升二百餘萬。廿支粗紗交易淸稀，十六支光明高喊三千六百萬元，好起一百五十萬元。</p>

<p>中央銀行業務局沈　局長，輸管會輸出推廣處長陳雋人，日前奉命赴平津，解救華北工商業之困難，已於八日公畢返滬。據陳雋人氏語記者：此次同沈局長赴業北，全爲解決平津工商業如何渡過年關問題。廠商成品之收購，係照四聯總處核定辦法辦理，含有救濟性質。但出口物資情形不同，單憑收購，不能解決出口之問題。天津方面，出口業卓具遠見，特集議建議政府四點：作澈底之解決，（一）結匯時間放長，（二）辦理出口物資押款，出口物資可作抵押貸款（三）辦理出口物資押匯，包括由產地運至出口口岸押款，及出口打包放款，（四）寄售出口物資時間放長，以上四點，爲其重要之建議。實則本會對此，已有通盤之籌劃，且一部已分別實行。最近因停止貸款，致未舉辦。前三項均無問題，第四項則有考慮之必要。北平方面，能出口物資，多屬工業產品，如刺繡，雕漆等，過去曾暢銷國外，現當另設辦法，擬分三方面辦理，（一）信用，（二）押款，（三）收購。已決定先貸款三億元，俾渡過年關。今後應先求有出路，確定國外市塲，再組織合作社，將此等分散之手工業，均加入合作社，作爲辦理之對象，決於六個月內分別推動。</p>

<p>（一）嚴格執行政府旣定政策，不予變更。（二）羊毛一項，於六十日期滿以後，絕對不准重運出口。（三）六十天期滿，適値農曆年關，姑念情形特殊，准再予寬限十天，十天期內，仍准原進口商申請政府收購。（四）如十天期限內，進口商仍不辦理申請收購手續，貨物予以沒收，由中信局公開標售。（五）以上各節，一面由會呈院核備，一面登記公告，預先　告商人，逾期如不辦理申請收購手續，政府決依照規定嚴予處置，俟院令到後，再行八告週知。</p>

<p>新醫與新藥</p>
<h3>談傷風咳嗽</h3>
<p>— 胡嘉言</p>
<p>今年的冬天似乎較往年寒冷得多，因此傷風咳嗽的人非常之多，眞是給予不少人的麻煩。其實傷風咳嗽是　人皆知的一種小疾病，在人生數十年過程中，是差不多無人能避免的。它是大半皆能自愈，祗須攝生有道，並用不着就醫服藥，這一種常識，也被一般人士所了解的。它的發生，　在氣候突變寒冷之際，故由炎熱而秋凉，由溫暖而酷冷，最易流行；尤以最近一月中的氣候，　次降至冰點以下，故　此者特多。關於本症之眞相究竟，以及如何即能避免發生，假如發生，如何即不能構成大患等種種；借本刋　地位一爲　露，我想對於一般民衆，無論已患未患，總不無小補罷！</p>
<p>什麼是傷風咳嗽症呢？這是過俗上　人皆知的名詞，並非　學上專門病名，咳嗽還可算一症　，傷風二字更談不到。原來醫學上的病名，乃係根據其發生的病因，或身體中任何部分之病理　化而定的；根據此點，所謂傷　咳嗽者，在醫學上，如（一）急性　　膜炎（鼻感冒），（二）急性喉　膜炎，（三）急性氣管及氣管枝炎　，都廊可能的。此三者雖單獨　　一症，其屬係有交互之關係　，因爲喉黏膜炎及氣管枝炎症　多係由鼻黏膜炎蔓延而致的·　於他們的大致情形，現在且一一述於下面。</p>
<p>鼻黏膜炎之初起，大半在咽　，初覺灼熱乾燥，輕度之嚥下困難，稍進則由咽入鼻腔，下至　喉，以及氣管氣管枝。其侵入　腔，則時作噴　，黏膜紅腫，　管狹窄，甚至有閉塞者，因是　吸發音俱起障礙；，其黏膜分泌吐盛，涕泗交流，初時薄如水漿，繼作厚黃，呈黏液化膿性；嗅　味覺均受障礙，間作頭度及輕　之溫度增高。—此現象大抵不出數日即告平復，惟發生鼻副腔炎中耳炎及氣管枝炎等合併症　，則屬例外。</p>
<p>其患黏黏膜炎者，則頸部喉　有奇癢及刺痛之感覺，咳嗽嘶嗄，最後幾成喑啞，大抵乾咳無痰，間呈黏液性。其黏膜腫脹發赤，惟須用喉鏡方可檢得。小兒之喉，每較成人爲　窄，故常呈劇重狀態，夜間驚醒，呼吸困難，　以喘鳴，咳聲粗大，面色蒼白，所謂假性白喉是；但如用溫蒸氣吸入，則短時內諸症輕快，且鼾然重睡，安靜如恒矣。——本症經渦約自三四日至一二星期，如咳嗽减輕，則其他症象亦以次消退。</p>
<p>氣管枝炎之發生，大抵始於咽部，及鼻感冒，漸漸越　部侵入氣管，而下及於左右兩肺氣管枝，故不僅限於氣管枝內；其病勢劇烈者，乃進犯小氣管及毛細氣管枝，所謂毛細氣管枝炎是。其諸症象中以咳嗽爲主，初發時爲頑固性之乾咳，咳時微痛，稍稍得透明無色之黏液痰，二三日後乃覺咳嗽輕鬆，咯痰漸易，痰呈黃色膿狀；體溫大抵無甚變化，初發時或微覺有熱，後即平復·若炎症侵入毛細氣管枝，則呈呼吸困難，脈膊加速，尤以小兒爲多，且不無危險。—本症預後尚良，大抵一一星期即可平復；惟小兒則易構成氣管枝肺炎症，老人則惹起心臟衰弱，陷於重篤，係屬例外。</p>
<p>上列諸症發生之原因，大抵多在感冒之後，此外若汚穢塵埃以及刺激性氣體之吸入，器械和化學的刺邀，均易構成。帶傳染性，往往一人患此，家族同伴相繼發生；其病原體未確定，大抵葡萄球菌，連鎖球菌，肺炎重球菌，流行性感冒桿萬，均屬混合傳染之一部分。其鼻甲及扁桃腺呈肥大者，亦爲易罹此症之素因。急性傳染病如麻疹，百日咳，流行性感冒等，均可併發此症，所謂續發性是。肺結核患者　此，使病勢趨於惡劣，尤宜防備。</p>
<p>關於本症之處理，因大半能自愈，藥劑上之助力不多，故預防上之注意，殊較治療爲重要；像戒除吸烟飲酒，省談話，禁忌辛辣食品，避免穢濁空氣及有害氣體之吸入等是。此外，在一般人士個人及家庭生活中，有幾種習慣，我覺得狠有矯正的必要；現在且分述於伶下，以作本文之結束。</p>
<p>（一）口呼吸之儘量避免　尋常用鼻呼吸，能使吸入之空氣，乾燥者濕潤，寒冷者溫暖，其空氣中之細菌塵埃，皆勾留於凹凸不平之鼻腔黏膜，使吸入之空氣淸凈無毒，入肺而不爲禍害。但人們對此並不加注意；尤在天以氣突冷多風之除，　友朋三五，閉步街頭，談笑無禁，結果吸氣由口而入，鼻道防禦機能完全廢絕，以致上述鼻感冒氣管枝炎等症之構成者殊夥，須加以檢點。萬一因習慣一時不易矯正，則可用口罩，俾可减少危險。</p>
<p>（二）嬰孩須分睡　我國家庭習慣，嬰孩每與其母共被同睡，此由於極端愛護之關係，及夜間哺乳之方便計；其實被內空氣之汚濁，係無疑問的，與嬰孩極不相宜。結果未病則易病，已病則易構成合併症，致遷延不易痊愈，殊不値得。</p>
<p>（三）小孩須養成呼吸新鮮空氣之</p>
<p>習慣　許多人家之小孩，其父母每禁彼出戶外遊戲，嬰孩則終朝處斗室中，緊閉窗戶，甚至陽光亦罕接觸，其目的云係避風，其實戶外之空氣，總較室內爲新鮮些。結果抵抗力愈弱，偶一至戶外，其感冒之構成，係遠較其他小孩爲易的。</p>
<p>（四）嚴冬之際的預防　在都市方面，很多有禦寒設備的；此設備旣精粗不一，且係人自爲政，各個不同的。假如從毫無設備的處所，而到溫度調節的地方去，每日往來迴覆，結果也易罹感冒的；故在可能範圍內，應儘量减少　好。</p>
<p>當鼻黏膜炎症分泌旺盛涕泗交流之際，人們排除鼻涕工作，每以兩指塲鼻，俾使外出；結果一部份分泌物每被吸入，而易惹起鼻副腔炎的。如果只用一指握一側之鼻，則可免此弊。</p>
<h3>編者的話</h3>
<p>有許多讀者寫信間各種病症的治法，並希望我們把答題登載在本報。這是我們所應當做而且也樂意做的·但是事實上也有許多麻煩，使我們力不從心。譬如說吧，時間上就不許我們這樣做，因爲我們都有各人的職業，除了勉强在本刊報道些新醫與新華的知識之外，那裏還有時間去答覆讀者呢？而且用通信方法去問病給藥，實在有很大的流弊。以前各報也曾有很嚴厲的批評。所以我們除了在某種情形中給予相當的指示外，就不願意寫出來登載在本刊，以免增加意外爲麻煩。這其中的苦衷諒必讀者也可以原諒吧！不過，我們得加聲明如果讀者附有地址及郵票，那末我們總希望抽出時間來直接答覆的。</p>
<p>有許多人來信詢問關於風濕症的特效　何處可以購買，可見此種病一定很多，可惜此　在滬尚無出售。惟此藥之合成亦不甚困難，目下正有細菌學專家正在研究製造，如有成績，當再報告。</p>
<p>有人寫信來指摘本刋過圍的醫藥廣告，問它是否與上海醫師公會及本刋有連帶關係，其實本會只負責本刋的文稿，所有一切的廣告皆與本刋編輯會無關。敬祈讀者注意！</p>
<h3>中醫史上之噴霧療法</h3>
<p>— 楊文漁</p>
<p>上月　七日申　康　　　　，有噴霧療法治氣喘新聞一則，並載明上海由醫院並特備器械供病家應用，此爲西醫之一種治療方法，而爲上海中醫院所採用者，然我在中國古史由亦曾見有著名醫生採用此怯治病，如　店書卷一百九十一許胤宗列傳，曾有這一段記戰，錄於下：</p>
<p>許胤宗常州義　人也，初事陳，為　　王外兵參軍，時柳太后病風不言，名醫治皆不愈，脈益沉而噤，胤宗曰，口不可下藥，宜以湯氣黨之，令　入　理，周理即　，乃造黃　防風湯數十斛，置於牀下，氣如烟霧，其夜便得語，由是超拜義興太守，陳亡入隋，歷尚藥奉御，武德初累授散騎侍郎，時關中多骨蒸病，得之必死，遞相連染，諸醫無能療者，胤宗每療無不愈。』（下略）新店　方伎傳亦載其事，附甄權傳中，大略相同，不復贅敍，此其所治之病及治病的方怯，與報端所述不同，且不言及用何種器械，然明明爲噴霧療怯，顯然無稽，今日西醫之噴霧療法，或即由中醫舊法，脫胎變化而出，不過中國人對於醫學，向來不甚研究，甚或有許多秘方，私相授受，不肯公開宣布，以致失傳，雖世所共知的「神農本草」，「黃帝紫問」，亦大多流傳失眞，且亦置之高閣，經過數千年來，並沒有新發明的醫万與醫藥，即如這種暗霧療法，兩見於正史文傳，然試問諸中醫先生，簡直少有知者，由此類推，吾國古時有效的醫方與醫藥，其淹沒不傳者殆不可勝數，中醫不能與西醫並駕齊訊，其大原因就在乎此，予因讀報有感，略爲論述，深望全國中醫先生，不要「數典忘祖」，速即搜採歷代古史及省縣志乘　的名醫，及其　效的方渠，編輯成醫，以資研究，再參以西醫之科學試騐，期合實用，不特可以保　國粹，且於人民生命　康，似亦不　裨　，敢質之　　代醫家以爲何如·</p>
<p>：先　此　係外來稿件，本　　在　進　醫　之　發，未可厚非。其實醫藥　　所　　中西之分，只有　　舊之別。漢唐時代有無數之西療方法自西域傳來，於今竟成爲　醫方面之國粹。近數十年來我國之　物被歐美各國採用者爲數亦不在少。可見中西醫藥原無牴觸，實可互相爲用。近年來之消治龍藥片以及白喉血淸之類且爲一部份之中醫所採用。更可知「無所謂中西之分，只有新舊之別」之爲不誣也。方今科學萬能，已不以原子彈爲滿足，若其株守於舊式之火藥火器（按火藥爲我國所發明）則其不爲他人所宰割所滅亡者無是理也。</p>
<p>楊君文內又曾力勸中醫「速即採搜歷代古史及省縣志乘中的名醫及其有效方　編輯成醫，口　研究，再參以西醫之科學試騐，期合實用，不特可以保存國粹，且於人民生命健康，似亦不無裨益」。其實不止中醫應適合潮流吸收新醫學識（漢唐時代之人士尚且能吸收西城醫學成爲國粹，何以今日便須抱殘守闕），即如現今之西醫亦應繼續研究，切勿夜郎自大，以爲掛起西醫招牌便有萬能之術。方今醫學日新月異，轉瞬間已成陳腐之學，爲人淘汰，惟有順應潮流繼續精進者，方能永立於顛撲不破之地位耳。</p>
<h3>戒酒新法</h3>
<p>— 梁俊靑</p>
<p>予曾在本刊介紹解除酒醉之法，頗有人以爲不很澈底，認爲以其醉後求解，何不將　酒癖戒除。其實偶爾一醉，庸有何傷？是故醉後求解，　亦不可或少者耳。雖然，酒能亂性，且傷身體，若能率性將　癖戒除，則其意義之重大，覺止延年　壽而已哉！用特草此一篇，以告讀者。</p>
<p>據美國史卡拉氏（Skala）報告，彼曾根據蒂曼氏法（Method　nach　J．Thiman）爲人戒除酒癖結果成績非常完　値得介紹。茲特摘譯如下：</p>
<p>戒酒者於早上空肚時皮下注射Stryclnin　lmg，同時則服Benzedrin或Percitin片5－10mg，於相隔二小時後則內服0.07之Emtin。約俟十五分鐘或廿分鍗後，則領病者至一半明半暗而設備完美且有飲料陳設之房間內。此時即爲其注射一種　合製齊於皮下。其混合製齊爲吐根素Emeti　0.05與縮瞳發汗劑Piocarpin　0．012－0.024及麻黃素Eohedrin　0.02-0.06，蓋含有催吐，發汗及推動全身血液循環之三種意義也。此種注射劑在初起時須用小量，其後則可酌奪情形，逐漸增加份量.俟戒酒者於注射此種混合劑後即選最好之酒約卅格蘭傾於一小酒杯內，冷戒酒者詳細觀察此酒之色澤，聞嗅此酒之香味，然後令其當試其味道而令其飲完此酒。相隔若干分鐘後，又令戒酒者於同一情形中飲完第二次之卅格蘭好酒。此時戒酒者即覺頭暈惡心。繼則發生嘔吐。每次飲酒一回之後即有二三次之嘔吐，將　所飲之酒完全吐出。最後則令戒酒者飲下一百西西啤酒而雜以0.015之Kalium　stiotaricum，使其飲酒時之惡心作用可以長久維持。此種戒酒法絕對安全可靠，惟戒酒者之脈搏若加速至於每分鐘一百四十跳時，則須立即停止使用。</p>
<p>照例使用上述方法四次或至八次時，則於意中形成一種下意識作用，自動竣生一種飲酒時惡心及嘔吐之聯想。此種聯想可使戒酒者見酒即厭，聞酒惡心，飲酒則吐，甚至想起酒類亦覺心煩。誠妙怯也。惟須注意者則爲此種注射後發生嘔吐之手術每次約在廿分鐘至卅五分鐘之間，不能超過卅五分鐘以上以免心臟方面發生影響。又在戒酒者應服之卅格蘭好酒時，起初最好選取上好之酒（如老白蘭地或威司基之類）。其後則逐漸改用啤酒或葡萄酒之類。在戒酒期間絕對不宜使用麻醉劑或鎭靜劑。若戒酒已經成功，則於相隔二月，四月以及八個月間尚須繼續使用上述方法三次，務使其對酒生厭之聯想作用永遠可以存在，則戒酒者方能根本戒絕。此種方怯雖覺令戒酒者一時不快，但爲時甚暫，（至多二足月）因不若老方法至少需時半年以上也。</p>
<p>戒酒時偶亦發生膀胱　攣及尿急便急等現象，但爲時不久即行消失，不必顧忌。若戒酒者患有心臟病，小腸疝氣，胃腸潰瘍，肺結核，肝臟萎縮以及急性之精神病等則萬萬不能使用此法，以免發生危險。（此文請參閱一九四七年份第十五册之Prakticky　lekar）。</p>

<h3>「新年來到」</h3>
<p>— 李振平</p>
<p>講風土的書是很有趣的，特別是自己住得久了的所在。小但可以知道先民的生活狀况，而且得能知道一種事情變化　淵源，好像小孩子打破沙鍋問到底，乃是一種求知慾滿足的暢快。若在這個歲月，就更可以當作渦屠門而大嚼，雖不得肉，聊以快意也。</p>
<p>近見報載，教育部特撥北京大學十億元，作爲收買舊書之用，不然將有全數賣給紙坊，改製還魂紙之厄，這種消息，給我們的刺激正不下於九龍事件。前些時，北方幾位議長南來請願說南方麵粉五十萬元，到北平就變成一百萬，原因是加了五十萬元一包的許可證費，—近日又證明是上海商人幹的，不與政府相干，我們且不去管這些事的主名，反正我們心頭已竟浮起了那風雪中古城所受的災難，城內城外，難民充斥，麵粉在年底，大約總得漲到一百五十萬了罷？連京滬都已超過七八十了呀！我自己生長北邦，且又稍知其歷史，對於這許多冰冷的事實，比一般人當然更有　測憤懣。</p>
<p>對於舊俗，北平是頑固者，爲了他是北平，是七百年帝都之遺的北平，我們對於這些舊俗，寗可有着傾愛與留戀，而絕不覺得其不合理，甚至正月初二起大早爭先到彰義門外趕財神廟，借回兩個紙元實，挿上兩朶紅絨花，亦復覺得不惡，一個民族有一個民族的傳統，一個地方有一個地方的Local　Colour，絕不當淺薄的加以唯物論式的非議的。美國是多麼先進和科學的國家，可是在Utah省照樣有本兒門教派，Mormonism日說他們的聖經定金色聖經，得自上帝秘傳，別八所傳，都是假的，這與宋江夢兄儿天玄女有何不同？而坎拿大Ouebec之聖安廟St.　Annalemple也有聖安娜的指骨一節，許人膜拜親吻，這不又是洋舍利子嗎？這意思並不是引外人以自重，Santa　Claus自烟囱而下，其意與財神爺之借元寳固無不同，則Evergreentree下之跳　何嘗不可改爲夜半燒香乎？</p>
<p>我在上海住了二年，南京也任了一年多，看不出多麼濃重的舊年風俗氣氛，除去東西拚命漲價和工人罷工餓工之外。不像北十一入臘月就有沿胡同賣松柏枝的，賣紙花及年晝的，大小孩子以及老頭子老太太，皆有一番新的心情，新的氣象，正如童諺所云：「糖瓜祭灶，新年來到，姑娘要花，小子要砲……」所云云也。劉同人「帝京景物略」中所記之風習，頗資觀覽，可惜手頭無書，不能抄其一二以嘗鼎一　，只記得說歲朝至正月底各種民間習尚極詳盡而已，士大夫身分多是衛道觀念者多，常把民間的故事平白詆訶一頓，劉君乃能超出此障，爲客觀的記叙，使三百年後，猶可有所印證，此其功殊不在小，蓋非普通文學史之類可以包拈。閒園鞠農「一歲貨聲」記歲末年初街頭食物玩具，尤爲只體明白，雖其文章不成話，却炒在着實地說，有如我們看見那些穿着老布棉襖，大年初一就擔了兩個甕子沿胡同呌賣「哎，辣菜！」（一種醃製之大頭菜，而有辣味者，殊鮮，專在正月初五以前食之。）的鄉下老農一樣，他們一見你淸早走出，必先向你這一聲「恭喜發財」，在質樸之外，又有）種說不出的禮意，此其爲可愛，何嘗在預定要整理的文物如故宮，萬壽山之下？老實說，我以爲北平喪失了他的都城資格或端門午門失修全不要緊，把那溫暖的人情喪失了才是莫大的損失。可是在一百五十萬塊錢一袋「洋麵」之下，人情怎麼能够不變質呢？按照老規矩，從除夕到初五，都是要吃「煮餑餑」的，「餑餑」即是水餃子，要用上好的麵粉及猪肉製造者也！連窩頭都得打算盤，這個還用談嗎？昔在北平，起初，教化子到各家「送財神爺」照例是從晚上起，可是到後來就不行了，帶着太陽就有人送，隔着板門在呌：「送財神爺來啦！」如果不接，必說幾句費話，所謂「駡駡咧咧」，如果接呢，又不勝其煩；到蘆溝橋戰起以來，剛吃過中午飯就有此輩來胡同攪人，那時候也不過慨嘆洋麵從三元漲到七元罷了，如今呢，也許，更節捷些，紙張這麼貴，連財神也迴避了吧？</p>
<p>黯淡的歲月，黯淡的心情，而又逢着這個不能不度的節日！</p>
<h3>一字萬金</h3>
<p>— 津津</p>
<p>數年以前，我在某刊物上，讀到一位作者的牢騷，對於當時稿費待遇之低，深致感慨，因此提出一字千金的口號，雖係一種空中樓閣的幻想，慰情聊勝於無。當時的「千金」，自然非現在的「千金』可比，而且所說的「金」字，其實是『『元」字的代名詞。不過，就是那時的千元，爲數亦頗可觀了。</p>
<p>這些時，一字千金的那句話，彷彿已離兌現之期不遠。水準以上的稿費，似乎至少概照一字百金（元）計算。再說如以最平民化的幣値單位——大餅油條來計算，目前一付大餅油條的代價，與戰前比較，係四千元與二分之比，即十十足足的漲了二十萬倍。那末，稿費照一字千金計算，相當於千字百萬金之數，聽聽數目有些嚇唬人，實際上還不是等於戰前的千字五元。彼時的第一流作家拿千字十元的，也很稀鬆平常。這裏也可反映我國通貨價値波動的劇烈，幾有一落千丈之勢了。</p>
<p>大槪一般的作者，搜索枯腸，暫時沒有題材可寫時，或是要處理一些柴米油鹽等「俗務」時，不禁就要寫到與他們有「切膚之痛」的稿費上去。本談日前曾經刋登過一篇有關稿費的文章（似乎寫這類文章，終要發些感慨似的），筆者覺得意猶未盡，故再在這裏來續贅幾句。</p>
<p>不佞常覺得文化人收入之菲薄，其咎似乎不在文化人本身，而在客觀環境的先天不足。</p>
<p>說到文化事業環境的先天不足，自以我國教育未能普遍，一般人不能嗜書報若命爲最大癥結。本來文化事業可以與工商業相一依爲命，工商業愈發達，則愈注重書報廣告的效力，間接即可使刊登廣告的各書報雜誌，得到有力的支持。試以美國爲例，儘管文化事業可能是一項淸高的事業，然而商業的氣氛極濃厚。有幾位紅作家聘有報紙代言人（PressAgent），代他盡宣揚之責。又如逢到出版一本新書時，出版家更率先在紐約時報圖書增刊等書報上，刋登全頁廣告，列載作者照片及各家好評，其情况的熱烈，不亞於捧一位舞台新角登塲的大吹大擂。</p>
<p>而且美國的作家，比我國的那些筆墨同志，似乎有辦怯得多，除掉稿費以外，還可收取撰寫長短篇定洋，出讓各報轉載權，電台廣播權，編製電影劇本權等，閑來還可上各地演說，出售聽講劵或者出席名流富戶主辦的派對，而爲會中的上賓，正是名利雙收，不啻爲最理想的職棄。</p>
<p>因此，美國作者旣有這麼多的生財法門，一字的代價，自屬可觀。例如號稱爲現代奧亨利及百老匯中家的代蒙。倫揚氏，平均寫一千字可購新汽車一輛，這比我國數年前作者們夢寐求之而不得的一字千金，更要値錢得多了。在本文臨末，筆者不禁要喊出一字萬金（元）的口號，也算是春節聲中，爲職業文人善頌善禱的微意。如果客觀的情形及條件沒有改變，明年今日，也許有實現的一天，雖然那時候的一萬元，是否能够買一枚郵票，一隻鷄蛋，或是幾分之一盒的火柴，却誰也不敢說了。</p>
<h3>買書難</h3>
<p>— 芒</p>
<p>在本刋有過一篇「著書難」，不但著書難，現在連買書也難。不是買不起，便是買不到，眞令人有爲「難」之感。</p>
<p>買書在目前確是一件難事。首先使買書的人感到爲難的是『『買不起」，價錢太貴，一般人都沒有能力購買。目前，一般人的購買力都很薄弱，普通日用品已無力購買，何况是被人目爲無關緊要的書籍呢？而且書價太昂，稍有購買力的人也無能爲力，都是嫌書價太「貴」。</p>
<p>然而，書店老板又是振振有詞，他們說：紙價太貴，排印工本高，售價也不能不予以提高，否則自己就要蝕本。這是很充分的一個理由，開書店的人也是有本錢的，你能呌他减低售價嗎？</p>
<p>第二個使人感到困難的是「買不到」。有人要這樣說：書店裏不是放了這麼許多書，儘你去買好了，誰說買不到書？書店裏確是放滿了書，但合於標準和要求的能有幾何？只要你跑到書店裏看看，大多數的書店裏都是賣的色情小說之類的書，眞正爲學術上的專著可算是寥寥無幾。因此，使買書的人第二個惑到困難的便是買不到所需要的書，即使有也是難副理想，買書的人便不得不下一番選擇的功夫，一般人提到選擇時，又是惑到非常困難的。</p>
<p>最後的一個買書的難題是到那一家書店去買。各個店家有各人的見解，有的希望薄利多賣，有的希望厚利少賣，買書的人便要先明白書店的作風。而且，有些書店的店員待人和氣，有的書店的店員則待人毫不客氣，我們當然要到前一種店裏去。旣然出了錢去買書，何必受別人的聞氣，這是誰也不能忍耐的吧。有時，你在書店裏稍微站立一刻，店員便會給你一個「沒趣」，說你妨害了他們的營業，這種情形給人實是難堪的，然而不明白的人就要受到這種待遇，也是買書的人的一「難」。</p>
<p>總之，一切的一切給買書的人都是一個「難」字，我們要解決這種困難，只有讀書的人和出版家密切聯繫起來，共同努力，這種種因難才有迎刃而解的希望</p>
<h3>逍遙花</h3>
<p>— 陳慎言</p>
<p>第十章　自願犧牲　（六八）</p>
<p>鏡如見她說得如此懇切，心裏如此懇切，心裏感助已極，不由又在錡紈肩上拍一拍道：「你這人太好了！你自己願意犧牲，可是我心裏不忍，並且諸　愛你已深，你也不能把他拒絕，他受了重大的刺激，很可以變生意外，那我老境更慘了！」綺紈遲疑了好一會道：「這個沒問題，我也承認，渚齊確是愛我，是眞心愛我的，我傾心他，就在這一點。我自有辦法應付他，不用我拒絕他，呌他自己會恨我，自會拒絕我，到那時侯，不脫離而自然脫離。但是我這種幹法，不明白我的人，一定要把許多難甚卑劣的批評，加到我身上，到那時老先生是聽得到的，老先生你知道我的苦衷，或者能原諒我……」綺紈說到這裏，容顏慘淡，淚珠滿面，巳鳴咽不能成聲，又哭起來。毓如點點頭道「願小姐，你如此苦心，來顧全我一家，呌我如何報答你。」绮紈道：「不！造此因才有此果，我當日本不該種情禇齊，渚是娶過太太的，但我一鍾情；一輩子便不能磨滅，我祗有把我這一顆心，帶到墳墓去。』說着又哭。毓如知道她心裏理欲交戰，難過已極，便道：「顯小姐，你的用心太苦了。這都是我今天冒昧前來，才使你受了這重大刺激！你且鎮一鎭神，這事不妨細加考慮。」綺紈道：「我已決定這樣辦，無須考慮，趁我此時理智清明，還能選擇一條道路走，不至害了他人，若等我理智湮沒，腦中完全爲愛情私意包圍，到那時要擺脫也擺脫不了，也許會幹出利己損人的事。我只希望老先生原諒我，我雖然在梨園界，我的家世是和一般人不同的，我最好面子，我絕不願幹出事來，落人家一個不好的批評。我已決全了，我要保全我自己的名譽，我要保全渚齊的全家，這就是我尊重我自己，並報答老先生教誨。我今天旣在你老先生面前說過，我就循着我主張，一步一步幹去，老先生你請放心好了。並且希望你回去對老太太說，我姓顧的，不會到她家裏來！」</p>
<h3>論文明國家</h3>
<p>— 晏如</p>
<p>前幾天有人在報上爲「文明國家」加上了一條定義：「文明國家便是其國內必容許反對份子或集團存在的國家」。又說：「一個國家裏有反對派在議會拍案痛駡，甚而遊行示咸，這個國家一定是生氣蓬勃的。這裏所謂文明，听謂生氣蓬勃，想必指英美兩國而言。惜乎現在的美國（英國我不淸楚）已經從生氣蓬勃到萎靡不振了。</p>
<p>據美國歷史書上說，距今約九十年前，該國的參議名Summr者，對南卡羅林那州的參議員Butter大駡山門（拍案與否不詳），激得同爲南卡羅林那州的議員又與Butter非親即眷的Brooks大怒，拿起極粗的司的克對Smmer頭一棒，把他打得昏倒不省人事，雖然出其不意，使對方猝不及防，殊失騎士風度，但南卡羅林那州人却佩服不已，除以盛筵款待Brooks外，並奉贈一枝新司的克，上面刻以妙文，日：「用以擊倒鼓舌如簧者」。當時的衆議院生氣尤為蓬勃，出席的議員須執槍備刀，以防萬一。爲了防止大動干戈，有二位賓夕凡尼亞州與北卡羅林那州的議員竟至被置於監禁之下，大槪這兩位議員先生頗有一言不合拔槍而放之概。這樣的生氣愈來愈見蓬勃，卒至爆發南北戰爭，死人用錢，不計其數。到現在盛極而衰，已到了拍案痛駡的地步，雖尚爲我國報人所歎賞，在美國人恐已大有今不如昔之感矣。</p>
<p>據此而論眼前世界各國的文明與野蠻，蓬勃與消沉，當首推英美最文明最生氣蓬勃，而以蘇聯爲最野蠻最消沉：蘇聯國內是絕不容許反對份子與集團，最高蘇維埃與最低蘇維埃也決無反對派拍案痛駡甚而遊行示威的。然而這種文明國定義與生氣蓬勃說是大有問題的。我不明白容許國內有反對份子或集團何以即爲文明國家。假各執政者常常下令從某月某日起全國人民一律絕食半個月而不許反對份子或集團拍案痛駡甚至遊行示盃威，的確大欠文明，殊乏生氣，但若執政者天天以人民的凍餒爲念，時時摸摸人民的肚子飽了沒有，手冷不冷，，餓了以食，冷了以手套，是不是還必須聘請點反對份子或集團，拍案痛駡一番，遊行示威一陣，才算足當文明之稱，於有蓬勃之氣呢？</p>
<p>老實說，寫文章容易，下定義大難，所以我決不下此定義：鄉原，德之賊也。</p>
<h3>連環偵探</h3>
<p>— 駝</p>
<p>私家偵探：我跟蹤你的丈夫，發現他到過三個夜總會，兩處單身公寓裏去。</p>
<p>懷疑的妻子：啊呀！他在幹什麼呀？</p>
<p>偵探：跟蹤着偵察你的行動！</p>
<h3>進步</h3>
<p>— 芳濟</p>
<p>一個宣傳家站在講壇上起勁的說道：「莫斯科的經濟建設是較前進步得多了，但看馬克思街上聳立着的二十層大厦就是一例。」一個熱心的聽衆便立起來校正他的錯誤說道：「我天天在馬克思街上走，並沒有看見過二十層的大厦呀！」宜傳家立刻　通：「你眞是太愚笨了。你爲什麼要妄費了時間到街上去走，你不會看看報紙上登着的國家建設的消息嗎？」</p>
<h3>舊京的食與住</h3>
<p>物價昂騰，生活不易，八方同慨，雖盡一言。「衣食住行」四大要素中，以「住」一端而論，古老的北平，似比滬漢各埠容易解決，一因地勢寬展，內外城周各四十餘里，大小人家，各有庭有院，很少「屋上加屋」，從外埠來者，每作花園之想。一因政府南遷以來，早失政治中心，又非通商口岸，衙門非昔北京部院之比，求名求利之旅客無復「百海朝宗」。則人口與地面之比例，自不致有太高之密度。大體說來，北平的房荒，還不至「頂」「搶」不堪。</p>
<p>但現在此古城仍能維持相當之大都市的景象，學界人多，應爲重要原因。究竟是「文化城」，最高學府所在地，幾個大學，北大，淸華，燕京，中怯及私立各學院，歷史悠長，規模宏整，能吸收全國各地士子，不遠千里負笈而來。政界則中央機關自行轅以下，地方機關自市府以次，亦應有盡有。至於商工界，如書業古玩，多河北人（保定以南，至冀州南宮等處）；匯兌莊，顏料店，乾菓店多山西人；綢縀業，飯莊，肉舖，米糧店，水夫冀夫等多山東人；是爲構成北平市面之三大宗。他們因交通阻隔，家鄉房田又被「淸算」，以致無家可歸，而淹滯於古城。其鄉人子弟爲避「鬥爭』或畏兵役而奔集，於是鄉村之眞凋敝，與都市之假繁榮，成互相依倚之勢。</p>
<p>房的買賣，房的典捐，房　租賃，此三項中，最麻煩者爲典押。十年以前，用一兩千塊錢能典四合小房一所，如當初契約訂明，十年期滿，原價收贖，則今日之一兩千元，買不到半個麵餅。即兩三年前，以房契或他物抵借現款者，今欲原價取贖，而幣値相差已巨。因此發生糾紛，互執一詞之告白，每見於報紙，閱之不禁失笑。</p>
<p>粗房之事，自淪陷時期，因僞幣之膨脹，已演出許多怪劇。房東不收房租，房客將租資存放銀行或郵局，登報聲明不負欠租責任，遂使銀行添了許多存款，而報紙則增加大量之廣告收入，坐收漁人之利。雙方爭論幣値，計較今昔之詞，令旁觀者無從斷其是非，而祗能認爲時代經濟變遷演成趣劇的悲劇。</p>
<p>但近來房租以「麵」爲標準，已成極普遍極公開的事實。衝要之區有每間每月索一兩袋者，偏僻地方十間以下之小宅亦需此數。因之「一袋麵一所房一個月』之「三一主義」之口號，最爲流行。麵價照年前行市，平均百萬一袋，則入口之家。小房一所，所負擔只房租一項，以法幣計數，大可驚人。但以麵為標準後，倒可省却月月重估幣値之麻煩。房客雖感代價過重之壓迫，亦因有標準省口舌而便之。</p>
<p>房東雖似處於高壓之有產地　，然亦呌苦不絕。因租出一房不論大小。依向例而言：決不專爲一袋麵。而今不得已，只求一袋麵，尚且挨駡。而收租不到，轉租舞弊之房客，迭次增加房捐調整地價之官府，處處需要應付，則謂有產可樂者，亦未免「一家不知一家難」。</p>
<p>因房租以「麫」爲標準，則「住」的問題，仍須仗「食物」來解決，可見生活四要素還以「食」爲第一位。「國以民爲本，民以食爲天」，自是顧撲不破之言。「衣食住」之序，乃平仄字音習慣自然，非謂「食」居『衣」次也。證之「饑寒」「飽暖」之「饑」「飽」在「寒」「暖」之上可知矣。</p>
<p>北方以麵爲標準，乃因北人大多數習慣麵食，而麵袋又比較易計也。南方不習麵，或以「米」乎？論「包」乎，「斤」乎？「斗」乎？「間」乎？幢乎？抑不用實物論乎？</p>
<p>編老案：前日深宵歸去，偶與車夫閒談，車夫告我曰：鄉人來滬者如潮湧，得一蔽風雨之地則大喜，因之近郊搭草棚出租之生涯極盛，每一間月案米四斗六斗不等云。</p>

<h3>Reduced Imports in the Fifth and Sixth Seasons: Quota Schedule to be Announced Together Today; This Unified Control is Solely for Saving Foreign Exchange</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 12th] The import quotas for the fifth and sixth seasons will be announced together on the 13th. According to a report submitted by the Import Control Committee to the National Economic Council on the 12th, the principle behind compiling this quota schedule is purely to save foreign exchange. There are four reasons for announcing the fifth and sixth seasons simultaneously: (1) The government faces foreign exchange difficulties and must conserve it. The quotas after conservation will undoubtedly fall far short of the needs of industry and commerce, making ordering difficult and easily leading to misunderstandings, creating psychological panic, and affecting prices. Therefore, the two seasons are being announced together. (2) Announcing them together allows for the allocation of months based on priority, preventing difficulties in foreign exchange allocation. (3) The combined total for the fifth and sixth seasons is on average 17% lower than that of the fourth season. (4) After the combined announcement of the two-season quotas, the committee plans to require gradual reporting of price fluctuations when most industrial raw materials obtained through these quota foreign exchanges are processed into goods and sold in the market, in order to facilitate control.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 12th] The Import Control Committee has already drafted the allocation schedule for the fifth and sixth season import quotas and submitted it to the National Economic Council for discussion on the 12th. After over an hour of detailed deliberation, the quota allocations have been largely determined, but a small portion still needs slight adjustments. The meeting decided to hand it over to a subcommittee for review. Wang Yunwu, Yu Hongjun, Zuo Shunsheng, Chen Qitian, Huo Baoshu, Jian Guansan, and others, seven in total, were appointed as review committee members, with Wang Yunwu appointed as convener. A subcommittee meeting is scheduled for 10:00 AM on the 13th for review. Once the review decision is made, it will not need to go through the National Economic Council again and can be submitted to President Zhang Qun for approval, with announcement at 3:00 PM. A key feature of the fifth and sixth season quota allocation is that it is reduced by 15 million US dollars compared to the fourth season. The total for the fourth season was over 53.3 million US dollars, while the fifth season is only over 30 million US dollars. The sixth season is roughly the same as the fifth, but the allocation numbers for cotton, wheat, and automobiles are still undetermined. During the discussion on the 12th, committee members offered many opinions on the quota allocation. Wang Yunwu advocated for a reduction in gasoline imports because, based on the conservation plan, there were restrictions on the use of private cars. He stated that if gasoline imports were too high, it would contradict the principles of the conservation plan and should therefore be reduced. Wang also advocated for relaxing the import quota for newsprint because Shanghai's paper production increase plan was not providing immediate relief, and current newspaper sales were soaring, often making past newsprint allocations insufficient. He argued that the government should support cultural undertakings and that relaxing the newsprint import quota was necessary. Jian Guansan put forward three points: A: The allocation of import quotas should reflect the direction of foreign exchange policy and should align with the ten self-help plans proposed by President Zhang. B: The quota allocation schedule should be arranged according to priority, without inverting the order of importance. Additions and reductions should be explained simply. C: The five items with unspecified numbers should still be listed, and it should be stipulated that cars cannot be imported. Zuo Shunsheng, Chen Qitian, and others also spoke. Zuo advocated for increasing fertilizer imports, and Chen also stressed increasing the import of machinery and raw materials. After lengthy discussion, apart from the majority that had been decided, the remainder was handed over to the subcommittee for decision on the 13th. Two principles were finalized on the 12th: A: The total value of quotas should be reduced compared to the fourth season, and the allocation of quotas should align with the conservation plan and the ten self-help plans proposed by Zhang Qun. On the 13th, concrete measures will be formulated based on the above two principles.</p>
<h3>Government to Adopt Measures to Stabilize Grain Prices in Various Regions; Separate Detailed Regulations to be Formulated for Foreign Investment in Factories</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 12th] The National Economic Council held its 34th regular meeting at 3:00 PM on the 12th. Chairman Zhang Qun began with a report by Deputy Secretary-General Gu Yuqun on the price situation in Shanghai, Hankou, and Tianjin over the past week. Generally speaking, grain prices in all three locations have fluctuated, with the sharpest price increase in Hankou, followed by Shanghai, and the least in Tianjin. The reason is that it is the end of the year, and merchants are taking the opportunity to raise prices. The government is currently working on countermeasures and will take measures to stabilize prices. It is believed that after the implementation of rationed grain sales starting on March 1st, grain prices can be expected to improve. The discussion then began on (1) the matter of welcoming foreign investment in China to establish factories, which was handed over to the competent authorities to formulate detailed regulations based on the first phase of economic construction principles, the Company Law, and the Mining Law. The content will re-explain the welcome for foreign investment in China to establish factories and provide special convenience to foreign businesses. President Zhang had previously expressed this in detail in August of last year. After the statement welcoming foreign investment in China to establish factories was released, five foreign companies came to China to register with the Ministry of Economic Affairs and apply to establish factories. Chambers of Commerce in various parts of China have suggested to the government that there should be certain regulations regarding foreign investment in factories. This was brought up for discussion at the National Economic Council on the 12th. Zhang Qun also spoke on this matter, saying that there had already been an explanation in the past, and there was no need to make separate regulations. Detailed regulations could be formulated by the competent authorities. (2) The fifth and sixth season import quota schedule (see separate article) was handed over to Wang Yunwu and the other seven people to convene a subcommittee meeting at 10:00 AM on the 13th for review. (3) The implementation measures for the financial portion of the economic reform plan were amended and passed (implementation measures were already reported in this newspaper on January 17th and 18th). In the original plan, sections (A) regarding the raising of domestic debt and (B) regarding the borrowing of foreign debt in the sixth implementation measure were deleted, and their implementation measures will be planned separately at an appropriate time. The original plan (7), which prioritized allowing people to purchase foreign exchange from the Central Bank with gold for the purpose of buying permitted imported goods, was entirely deleted. This is because the emergency economic measures promulgated in February of last year are still being implemented, and gold cannot be used as currency, so it cannot be used to purchase permitted imported goods. These implementation measures were changed to be planned separately at an appropriate time. Regarding the stabilization of the monetary system, the original plan (5) stated that the government should allow people to use gold to purchase government-sold state-owned production enterprises and enemy and puppet industries in order to increase the reserve of legal tender, but these implementation measures were entirely deleted and will be planned separately at an appropriate time. The three points in the implementation measures at the conclusion of the economic plan's implementation measures were also entirely deleted. (3) The State-Owned Enterprise Management Law was entrusted to Pan Xulun and Gu Yuqun to formulate measures and draft implementation details, which will be completed within a week.</p>
<h3>Economic Reform Plan</h3>
<p>Implementation Measures Fully Discussed</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 12th] The implementation measures for the economic reform plan were fully discussed by the National Economic Council on the 12th. The entire economic reform plan and implementation measures have been completed and will be sent by the National Economic Council to the Executive Yuan after the text is finalized, and then submitted by the Executive Yuan to the State Council for approval, after which they can be implemented. When the National Economic Council completed the discussion of the implementation measures on the 12th, President Zhang Qun stood up and spoke, narrating the process of drafting the economic reform plan and emphasizing that it should be implemented as soon as possible. President Zhang said that the economic reform plan was originally proposed by the Kuomintang, but after he took over the Executive Yuan, feeling the importance of economic reform, he modified the plan proposed by the Kuomintang and submitted it to the State Council for instructions. First, the State Council handed it over to the National Economic Council for review, and after the review, it was passed by the State Council. After much effort, there is now the entire plan and implementation measures. Currently, due to military and other reasons, the internal implementation of the economic plan is not without difficulties, but anything that can be implemented will be implemented as soon as possible. Zhang also specifically instructed that the self-help plans he proposed are all interconnected with the economic reform plan's implementation measures. The implementation of the ten self-help plans is achieved through the economic reform plan's implementation measures. Therefore, after the entire plan and implementation measures are presented to the State Council for review, they will be implemented as soon as possible.</p>
<h3>Election of National Assembly Delegates; Announcement Coming Soon</h3>
<p>The Withdrawal Method to be Implemented</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 12th] Regarding the issue of National Assembly delegate candidates, the Kuomintang Central Standing Committee decided to send important officials to various regions to persuade party members to concede to members of friendly parties. These officials have now returned to Nanjing, and the original deadline for withdrawal was the 12th, which has now passed. According to authoritative sources, the Central Standing Committee has decided to proceed according to the originally passed withdrawal method. Those who do not comply with this method can deny it by publishing a statement in the newspaper, and the Central Standing Committee will decide to expel them from the party and revoke their nominations according to the original method. Furthermore, the list is expected to be announced on the 19th of this month after further sorting in the coming days. In addition, the National Assembly Preparatory Committee has officially announced the registration date for the National Assembly delegates, and preparations are being actively made for the accommodation of the delegates.</p>
<h3>Yu Youren Acknowledges Considering Running for Vice President</h3>
<p>No Intention to Continue as President of the Control Yuan</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 12th] Regarding the issue of the current President of the Control Yuan, Yu Youren, considering running for Vice President, he has been considering it. When Yu was asked about this by reporters, he answered with an extremely open attitude, saying, "I absolutely do not want others to fail in their election, but I hope even more that I will succeed in my election." This was because someone mentioned that Li Zongren would also be participating in the Vice Presidential election. Yu expressed that he does not intend to continue in the position of President of the Control Yuan, saying, "After the implementation of the Constitution, the number of members of the Control Yuan will increase, and their powers will be strengthened, which will further deepen the influence on politics. I have led the Control Yuan for seventeen years, and I will definitely not want to continue in the position of President of the Control Yuan in the future." Yu also plans to visit England, the United States, the Soviet Union, France, and other countries after the National Assembly to increase mutual understanding.</p>

<h3>Kangding-Yanyuan Border Remains Unstable; Local Chieftain Leading Tribal Soldiers to Harass the People</h3>
<p>Miyi of Yanyuan Once Held the County Magistrate Hostage</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Chongqing, 12th] Yanyuan and Yanbian counties, located in the southeast of Ning County, Kang Province, have recently reported unrest. The great chieftains Zhuge Shaowu and Zhuge Shihai, father and son, assisted Ba Chengji, the chieftain of the Right Garrison of Yanyuan, in leading tribal soldiers to attack the Jiwa River border, causing great losses to the people. It is reported that Zhuge Shaowu came to Chongqing in the 30th year as a representative of the chieftains of Liangyan and Jiushuo and paid respects to the central government. He was also given an advisory title by the former Military Affairs Commission. Shihai once served as the Yi Affairs Commander of the Reclamation Committee and the Brigade Commander of the Kang Province Special Security Command, and is currently an alternate representative to the National Assembly.</p>

<h3>US Restricts Export Trade, Prioritizing Domestic Supply to Stabilize Prices; Ministry of Economic Affairs Studies Impact on China</h3>
<p>[Report from our Nanjing office, 12th] The Ministry of Economic Affairs recently received a report from the commercial counselor's office at our embassy in the United States, stating that the US Department of Commerce's Office of International Trade recently convened commercial counselors or other representatives from embassies and legations of various countries in the United States to announce a new export licensing policy. The purpose of this policy is to uphold the principle of competitive private trade by issuing export licenses as a means to prioritize domestic needs, stabilize domestic prices, and reduce foreign exchange demands. The controlled export items include over 400 types in the first batch. This will have a significant impact on China's import and export trade. In the future, China's import of essential materials from the United States will be further restricted. The Ministry of Economic Affairs is currently studying the matter in detail and will soon convene representatives from relevant ministries to discuss appropriate measures.</p>
<p>[Report from our Nanjing office, 12th] Regarding the accusations from tung oil manufacturers in the southern United States that Chinese merchants are dumping tung oil in the US at prices far below actual production costs, and reports that US customs will investigate Chinese tung oil prices, import methods, and production conditions, the Ministry of Economic Affairs has made a defense. It is indeed true that due to exchange rate issues, the legal tender (fabi) obtained by general exporters after settlement is often lower than the fabi cost. However, this is a temporary and exceptional situation under foreign exchange policies, and not something that merchants desire, especially not limited to tung oil alone. As for the supply of tung oil, China is virtually the only major exporting country in the world and does not face fierce competition from other countries. If conditions allow, China only wishes to see international tung oil prices rise; why would we engage in dumping? Furthermore, tung oil exporters rarely engage in domestic sales, making it difficult to constitute dumping. The foreign accusations are purely based on their own private interests and a lack of understanding of China's current foreign exchange management and foreign trade regulations, resulting in a case of putting the cart before the horse.</p>
<h3>Marshall Declares at Press Conference that Aid to China Awaits Presidential Decision; Representative Judd Accuses Secretary Marshall of Obstructing Aid to China</h3>
<p>[US Information Service, Washington, 11th] Secretary of State Marshall told reporters on the 11th that the $570 million aid-to-China plan has been received from the National Advisory Council, which is responsible for studying financial issues, and is ready for final consideration by the Bureau of the Budget and the President. When asked if this included military aid, the Secretary of State replied that it was an economic proposal, but stated that the proposal would not interfere with the Chinese government's freedom of action.</p>
<p>[United Press, Peoria, Illinois, 11th] Republican Congressman Judd, speaking last night at the Citizens Association, accused Secretary of State Marshall of "obstructing" aid to China and urged immediate aid to China to prevent it from falling into communist hands. He stated: "Mr. Marshall's job is difficult, almost impossible. He is a great patriot, but not a great Secretary of State. We need someone with foresight and talent in diplomacy, different from what is cultivated by intelligence and military training. Asia now balances the two major armed camps of the US and the USSR. The United States needs China more than China needs the United States. China may be able to survive after the demise of communism, but this highly organized and fragile Western civilization cannot."</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, New York, 10th] The Pacific Affairs' bi-weekly "Far Eastern Survey" published for the first time an article expressing support for US aid to China. The article, titled "The Issue of Aid to China," was written by Professor Lindbergh, who presented four major reasons for aid: Politically, there is no other legitimate channel to provide aid besides the Chinese government. Currently, there are only two major groups in China, the Kuomintang and the Communist Party, with no hope for a third force to emerge. US public opinion and politics would not support the Communist Party, so the target of aid must be the Nanjing Nationalist government, and aid to China is also consistent with Roosevelt's policies. Roosevelt's policies are divided into two aspects: (1) An inner circle alliance with all non-communist democratic countries within the outer circle alliance with anti-fascist countries, which is what Truman is currently implementing. (2) Recognizing the Soviet sphere of influence, as Lippmann said. Practically speaking, providing aid through the Nationalist government is feasible. Wedemeyer has more experience than anyone else and is confident in the effectiveness of this aid. From a humanitarian perspective, aid to China is the best way to end the war south of the Yellow River and stabilize wars in other regions; otherwise, the Chinese civil strife will inevitably extend abroad.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 10th] The State Department announced today that the implementation plan for the $18 million relief fund for China after the end of UNRRA will be finalized soon and announced this weekend. Congress passed the second aid-to-China plan after the end of UNRRA during a special session last December.</p>

<p>Weekly Forum</p>
<h3>On This Year's National Budget (Part Two)</h3>
<p>— Zhang Baiyi</p>
<p>Not patterned, overgrown  The national banking system absorbs fixed deposits The greater such as follows:</p>
<p>(1) The Ministry of Finance and the Four Allied Banking Organizations and the Central Bank will jointly form a fixed deposit absorption planning committee.</p>
<p>(2) The Treasury Department of the Ministry of Finance, together with the Treasury Bureau of the Central Bank, will issue special preferential short-term national treasury savings bonds, such as the Savings Bonds and National Savings Certificates issued by the British Treasury during the war, with a term of one year and a monthly interest rate of 1.5%. The issuance amount will be at least 10 trillion yuan.</p>
<p>(3) National banks and treasury departments will jointly issue special savings deposit certificates, divided into three-month, six-month, and one-year terms, with monthly interest rates of 10%, 1.5%, and 20% respectively. For three-month and six-month terms, interest can be deducted in advance. The face value will be divided into 1 million, 5 million, and 10 million yuan, thereby absorbing small savings. The issuance amount will be 20 trillion yuan.</p>
<p>(4) The Ministry of Finance will entrust the Central Trust Bureau to handle enemy and puppet properties, including jewelry and illicit assets of Chinese traitors that have been confiscated by the state, by issuing savings lottery tickets. This will be completed in cooperation with the Central Savings Association of the Bureau and the enemy and puppet property liquidation offices in various regions. Each time lottery tickets are issued, 10 million tickets will be issued, with each ticket priced at 50,000 yuan. It is estimated that savings deposits of 6 trillion yuan can be absorbed throughout the year.</p>
<p>(5) The existing group profit-sharing savings deposits of the Central Savings Association of the Central Trust Bureau will continue to be processed, but the deposit amount and bonus amount can be appropriately increased by one to two times to increase the absorption of fixed deposits.</p>
<p>(6) The special prize-winning savings bonds issued by the Central Savings Association of the Central Trust Bureau during the war have been discontinued after the end of the war. However, in order to absorb savings, they can also continue to be processed, with 5 million numbers issued each period and each number priced at 100,000 yuan. The top prize will be increased to 1 billion yuan. In this way, 6 trillion yuan in fixed savings can be absorbed each year. However, the principal repayment period should be shortened from ten years to three years.</p>
<p>(7) Before implementing currency reform, the Ministry of Finance should make a statement of preferential treatment for depositors in national banks and treasury departments; for ordinary deposits in national banks and treasury departments held by the people for more than six months, the exchange rate to the new currency will be reduced by 50% or 30% for deposit amounts below 10 million yuan compared to the ordinary exchange rate. This can increase small savings and also prevent imbalances in the distribution of national wealth due to currency reform, and can accelerate the stabilization of the current currency situation and facilitate currency reform.</p>
<p>(8) The Treasury Department of the Ministry of Finance and the Audit Office of the Central Bank should cooperate to strengthen the audit of the receipts and disbursements of funds of government agencies (including all state-owned enterprises and national schools). If it is discovered that funds are withdrawn from the depository bank and transferred to commercial banks for profit, payment will be immediately suspended to the agency in question.</p>
<p>China's Such as above. If the government can truly act in this way, then it is deeply believed that the fixed deposits and national savings of national banks and treasury departments will be greatly increased. At the same time, the national treasury can also absorb a portion of savings and at least reduce some of the annual debt. If the people can understand the government and actively support these extraordinary financial measures, just like the spirit of the Soviet and British people buying public bonds in large quantities within a few days during the war, then most of the people's purchasing power can still be controlled by national banks and treasury departments as before the war. Prices will immediately stabilize, the currency will gradually restore its credit due to price stability, and the people's interest in saving will gradually be restored. As a result, both the national economy and the people's livelihood will benefit.</p>
<p>The third question is whether the current system for tax collection and treasury fund receipts and disbursements is sound. This point is extremely important. We should know that if both government revenue and expenditure are subject to corruption, then revenue will be smaller and expenditure will be greater, resulting in an increase in the deficit. We certainly cannot suspect that all the civil servants in the entire tax system of the Ministry of Finance are corrupt, nor can we suspect that all the clerical staff in government agencies at all levels and all state-owned enterprises and national schools that rely on national treasury funds are corrupt, but we also cannot guarantee that there is absolutely no such phenomenon. The passive purpose of the Public Treasury Law promulgated and implemented by the National Government in 1938 was to prevent this phenomenon.</p>
<p>However, since the later period of the War of Resistance, government expenditures have actually been declining step by step, and market prices have been rising daily under the manipulation of speculators. The living standards of civil servants have gradually declined, and the trend of decline has not stopped even today. Precisely because of this, the Public Treasury Law cannot achieve its perfect purpose. The author does not need to cite many examples. The recent corruption in two major agencies in Shanghai is enough to show the existence and danger of this fact. Analyzing our national character, most politicians have always been honest and self-disciplined, and the virtue of thrift among the people has also been a traditional spirit for thousands of years. The reason why this phenomenon occurs is, on the one hand, due to the imperfection of the system, and on the other hand, the decline in the living standards of civil servants. Therefore, the author suggests that the living treatment of civil servants must be reasonably improved, as mentioned earlier. At the same time, there should be technical reforms in the system.</p>
<p>First, let's discuss the tax collection system. According to the Public Treasury Law, tax officials can avoid directly receiving cash, but in reality, tax collectors and taxpayers often collude in corruption. For example, if the tax amount should be 100 million yuan, the tax collector can reduce it to 30 million yuan at the request of the taxpayer, and half of the 70 million yuan not paid by the taxpayer is pocketed by the tax collector. As a result, the national treasury actually receives only 30 million yuan, while the remaining 70 million yuan is sacrificed to the corruption of both parties. In order to prevent the corruption that may occur, we must strive to change the collection system. According to the author's research, during this extraordinary period, extraordinary measures should be used. It is best to establish a unified industrial and commercial tax on the central system of coarse taxes and abolish all existing taxes involving industry and commerce at the same time. Based on the commercial prosperity index of various regions across the country, and stipulate a fixed amount of unified commercial business tax, directly entrusted by the Ministry of Finance to the national industrial and commercial law firms. The method of collection is only to notify local industrial associations or chambers of commerce by the national industrial and commercial law firms, and then local industrial associations or chambers of commerce will notify various industrial and commercial trade associations, and then various industrial and commercial trade associations will notify various factories and shops to automatically pay the prescribed tax amount directly to the local depository banks or financial institutions acting as depositories. This method is limited to extraordinary periods. Once the suppression of the rebellion is over, the original system will be restored. There are many advantages to collecting this unified industrial and commercial business tax: (1) It can avoid corruption; (2) It is simple and convenient for citizens to pay taxes; (3) It promotes the spirit of paying taxes as a national duty; (4) It reduces government collection costs. According to the author's rough calculation, if the government implements this unified industrial and commercial business tax, the national treasury can receive an annual income of 30 trillion to 50 trillion yuan.</p>
<p>Regarding the system of treasury fund receipts and disbursements, in terms of the system, there seems to be no problem due to the existence of the Public Treasury Law. However, in fact, according to Articles 4 and 5 of the Public Treasury Law, government agencies at all levels can independently manage and receive and disburse funds within a certain amount. Therefore, in fact, agencies at all levels have not been able to eliminate all corruption in receipts and disbursements. However, it would certainly be difficult if all receipts and disbursements had to go through the depository bank. As of today, it is believed that very few clerical units of various agencies are completely honest and self-disciplined. For major building repairs and large-scale material purchases, or large-scale printing expenditures, although there are bidding regulations and auditors dispatched by the Audit Department to supervise, in fact, the bidders are often the same person or there is only one bidder. When the author worked in a certain agency, the bidders for building repairs were the same person dozens of times, which was suspected by colleagues but was also an open secret. Therefore, the bidding system is merely a formality. The author firmly believes that a considerable amount of money is inevitably wasted on corruption in the clerical expenditures of government agencies at all levels.</p>
<p>According to the author's research, the persons in charge of general affairs or clerical units of agencies at all levels must have profound knowledge and a revolutionary mindset. At the same time, the person in charge of the agency must absolutely avoid employing relatives as the head of clerical affairs. In this way, if corruption or other matters are discovered one day, they can be immediately transferred to the court.</p>
<p>Fourth, regarding public debt policy. Since the legal tender (fabi) became unstable, bank deposits have flowed out in large quantities and directly or indirectly become speculative funds in the market. The phenomenon of freely purchasing public bonds can be said to be non-existent. On the one hand, this is due to the low level of national education and patriotism, and on the other hand, it is because the rate of price increases exceeds the natural rate of issuance increases by about ten times. Therefore, people have become uninterested in public bonds. Precisely because the public bond policy cannot be thoroughly used, the speed of inflation is further deepened. Therefore, the author believes that the public bond policy must be continued to be used under these difficulties. However, there is no need to issue public bonds in US dollar or British pound units, because these public bonds affect the credit of the fabi itself and also increase the burden on the government's treasury, and the people may not welcome them very much. The author now suggests that the government issue a type of prize-winning public bond (Zinsenlotterie or Praemienanlehen). The unit of the public bond is still the fabi, with 100,000 yuan as one share and 1 million yuan as one full sheet. Each full sheet has a number. Drawings are held once a month, with 10 million numbers issued each month, or 10,000 full sheets, totaling 10 trillion yuan. Ten percent of this is set aside for prize money, which is 1 trillion yuan. The distribution is as follows:</p>
<p>First prize One ticket 100 billion yuan Total 100 billion yuan</p>
<p>Second prize Two tickets 50 billion yuan Total 100 billion yuan</p>
<p>Third prize Four tickets 25 billion yuan Total 100 billion yuan</p>
<p>Fourth prize Eight tickets 12.5 billion yuan Total 100 billion yuan</p>
<p>Fifth prize Twenty tickets 5 billion yuan Total 100 billion yuan</p>
<p>Sixth prize One hundred tickets 1 billion yuan Total 100 billion yuan</p>
<p>Seventh prize One thousand tickets 100 million yuan Total 100 billion yuan</p>
<p>Eighth prize Ten thousand tickets 10 million yuan Total 100 billion yuan</p>
<p>Ninth prize One hundred thousand tickets 2 million yuan Total 200 billion yuan</p>
<p>Total number of winning tickets: 111,135 Total prize amount: 1 trillion yuan</p>
<p>The prize-winning public bond is an interest-free public bond. The principal repayment period is ten years. If currency reform occurs during the ten years, it will be converted according to the new currency and will receive the same preferential treatment as bank deposits. Winning lottery tickets will no longer be repaid. If the government accepts this suggestion, the government can absorb 120 trillion yuan of idle funds annually through prize-winning public bonds. After deducting prize money of 12 trillion yuan and other printing, paper, transportation, and handling costs, there will still be 100 trillion yuan left. On the one hand, it can stabilize finance by absorbing a large amount of idle funds, and on the other hand, it can also repay all the domestic debts issued during and before the war (including public bonds in foreign currency units), which will be discussed later. Because this type of prize-winning public bond has a gambling nature, it should not be used frequently. However, the author believes that during this extraordinary period, using this extraordinary method is still a good fiscal policy. The participation of finance in the national economy and financial market is also required by the emerging theory of fiscal science.</p>
<p>Fifth, regarding income from state-owned property. Before and during the war, income from state-owned property was originally insignificant in terms of finance. However, since the end of the war, due to the confiscation of enemy and puppet property and the donation and low-price purchase of US surplus materials, this state-owned property will theoretically be an important source of revenue in finance. A portion of the enemy factories was nationalized and converted into state-owned enterprises. Therefore, the main income from enemy and puppet property should be the illicit assets of Chinese traitors. However, in fact, many Chinese traitors have been dealt with, but most have not yet been dealt with. The reason for this is that the procedures for dealing with Chinese traitors in ordinary judicial organs are too slow. Two and a half years have passed since the end of the war, but very few Chinese traitors have been finally sentenced. The crimes of most Chinese traitors have not yet been determined, resulting in the inability of enemy and puppet property handling agencies to handle them.</p>
<p>According to the Central Trust Bureau's enemy and puppet property liquidation office in the Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui regions, the office was established in December 1945 and received enemy and puppet property worth 1,202.477 billion yuan from its inception to December 1946, of which 520.155 billion yuan has been processed and 682.79 billion yuan has not been processed. In addition, there are 498,731 liang, 6 qian, 9 fen, and 7 li of gold in the Central Bank. Because its valuation is still in December 1946, and some of the property and materials were estimated in 1945, there is a need to study its valuation. For example, the approximately 498,732 liang of gold stored in the Central Bank is worth about 5 trillion yuan at today's market price. As far as the author knows, most of the precious jewelry, diamonds, jade, gems, pearls, etc. of Chinese traitors have not yet been processed. According to today's market price, it has increased at least 100 times compared to the original valuation. Therefore, the unprocessed enemy and puppet property of 682.79 billion yuan can be increased to at least 68.279 trillion yuan at today's market price. Many have been processed in the middle of last year, but there are still some hidden properties of enemy and puppet properties that have been discovered after being reported confidentially. Therefore, according to the author's rough estimate, if all enemy and puppet properties nationwide can be processed this year, the national treasury's income can be expected to be 100 trillion yuan. However, this state-owned property is being shelved due to the government's various departments not being able to closely cooperate, and some important economic traitors are being released or acquitted, or will still be returned by the enemy and puppet property handling agencies. If the current situation continues to be delayed, the income from state-owned property in last year's national budget is feared to still fall short. The most numerous among Chinese traitors are economic traitors. The purpose of economic traitors is to absorb the people's wealth and indulge in enjoyment. It is unwise not to sentence these traitors severely, and it is even more inconceivable to release them casually or even acquit them due to the personal relationships of a few high-ranking officials! I recall that Chairman Jiang of the National Government had the following instructions at the Eighth Plenary Session of the Central Committee: "In the future, the War of Resistance will emphasize both military and economic aspects. The decisive force of the future success or failure of the enemy and us will be 70% economic and 30% military." This is enough to prove the importance of the economic position during the Sino-Japanese War. Japan is quite lacking in resources, so it proposed the slogan of "using war to support war," the purpose of which is to use the Chinese economy to invade China. If economic traitors are its pawns, then their crime should be equal to military traitors and political traitors.</p>
<p>Recalling that on September 3, 1941, the National Government promulgated the "Regulations on Prohibiting the Transportation of Materials to the Enemy," which stipulates in Article 1: "The investigation, prohibition, and handling of domestic materials transported to the enemy shall be governed by the provisions of these Regulations"; Article 11 stipulates: "If the smuggled goods are sold to the enemy and the facts are verified, the penalty shall be death or life imprisonment." Also, Article 29 of the "Regulations on the Management of Agriculture, Industry, Mining, and Commerce in Extraordinary Times" promulgated by the National Government on October 6, 1938, also stipulates: "Those who supply raw materials or goods to the enemy shall be sentenced to life imprisonment or imprisonment for seven years or more." It can be seen that the National Government had already established the principle of law for punishing economic traitors, that is, all economic traitors should be sentenced to at least seven years of imprisonment. By 1941, in view of the importance of economic traitors to the war, it was amended to at least life imprisonment. Therefore, these traitors do not need to be tried by the court for a long time. Those with solid evidence should be sentenced to at least life imprisonment in the first instance, and even if the sentence is reduced, it should be at least seven years of imprisonment. The author suggests that all traitor cases must be judged in full this year. Those with solid evidence shall be sentenced to imprisonment for seven years or more in the first instance, and all their property shall be confiscated. The enemy and puppet property liquidation agencies can then seal up all their property and immediately put it up for auction or sale. The income will be the national treasury's state-owned property income.</p>
<h3>Central Government Agency Civil Servants Food Rice Distribution Measures The Executive Yuan Announces Implementation from This Month</h3>
<p>[Report from our Nanjing office, 12th] The Executive Yuan recently announced four measures for the distribution of food rice to civil servants in central government agencies, which will be implemented from February. The original articles are as follows: (1) From February 1948, central government agency civil servants will be provided with 3 shi dou of medium-quality food rice per person per month free of charge. Technicians and laborers will be provided with 2 shi dou of medium-quality food rice per person per month free of charge. Police officers and police officers of police agencies who have not received food rice will be handled in accordance with the regulations for staff members. The central government agencies mentioned in the preceding paragraph are limited to those listed in the annual national budget as having living subsidies for Xuan Tong government agencies, public opinion agencies, and national schools. Military agencies, troops, publicly owned operating agencies, and business agencies whose living subsidies are included in the business expenses will not be issued. (2) Beijing, Shanghai, Pingjin uniformly distribute physical objects as before. Other regions temporarily distribute cash according to the prescribed amount of food rice due to food shortages. The standard for the food rice substitute in the preceding paragraph is one province (city) as one region, which is determined by the Ministry of Food each month based on the average retail food price in each region in the previous month, and notified to the Ministry of Finance and submitted to the Executive Yuan for record. (3) The food rice substitute to be received by the employees of each agency shall be strictly drawn from the reserve for living subsidies in the national budget in accordance with the standard of food rice substitute in each region and each month determined by the Ministry of Food and the number of employees who actually have monthly living subsidies, and allocated by each agency according to the actual number of employees. If the aforementioned reserve is insufficient, the Ministry of Finance may first make a mechanical allocation and then complete the formalities afterwards. (4) Ping is mainly based on pasta. Each staff member will be changed to 33 jin of No. 2 flour per month (equal to 3 shi dou of food rice converted into three-quarters of a bag of flour), and technicians and laborers will receive 22 jin of flour per month (equal to 2 shi dou of food rice converted into half a bag of flour). Beijing and Shanghai will be issued food rice or equivalent flour in accordance with the provisions of item 1. The procedures for receiving rice and flour shall be carried out by each agency with the purchase certificates issued by the distribution agencies, and the grain distribution agencies shall be required to collect the physical objects. Those who do not need physical objects shall be recovered by the Ministry of Food at a price. The original food rice or flour distributed in Beijing, Shanghai, and Pingjin in accordance with the regulations on the supply of daily necessities will be cancelled from February.</p>
<h3>Mayors of Beiping and Tianjin Fly to Beijing to Attend Food Rationing Conference</h3>
<p>[Our Beiping Office, 12th] The Five Major Cities Food Conference is scheduled to convene in Beijing on the 15th. He Siyuan, the Mayor of Beiping, Wen Chongxin, the Director of the Social Affairs Bureau, Du Jianshi, the Mayor of Tianjin, and Hu Meng, the Director of the Social Affairs Bureau, are scheduled to fly to Beijing tomorrow.

The departments of civil affairs, finance, construction, and education are also planning to work together in one office. This can be legally implemented after Wang Lingji returns to the province from Gu.</p>
<h3>Registration of Naturalized Citizens: Internal Order for Implementation</h3>

The Ministry of the Interior has recently issued an order to the provincial and municipal governments to thoroughly investigate the situation through the household registration authorities from this year onwards and order the naturalized citizens to complete the various registration procedures to comply with legal requirements.</p>

<h3>Price Increases Reported in Various Places During the Spring Festival</h3>
<p>[Our Zhenjiang Office, 12th] The Zhenjiang business community has safely passed the Lunar New Year. Most stores in the market, except rice shops, are still closed today to celebrate the Spring Festival. Currently, the price of rice in Zhenjiang is 1.55 million yuan per shi.</p>
<p>[Our Xuzhou Office, 12th] During the Spring Festival, prices in this city skyrocketed. Fine flour is 1.1 million per bag, white japonica rice is 2.8 million per shi, and other daily necessities have increased by one-third.</p>
<p>[Our Nanchang Office, 12th] The Nanchang market after the Spring Festival is still in a "spring sleep." The rice market rose sharply on New Year's Eve, breaking the one million mark, keeping pace with gold and silver. Most industries hoard goods and do not sell them, and they are still expecting prices to rise, but there is still no market.</p>
<p>[Our Fuzhou Office, 12th] The Spring Festival prices in Rong City have been relatively quiet. Rice has fallen back to the 2.2 million level (it had risen to 2.4 million before New Year's Eve). Oil prices are soaring at around 7 million. There is no market for cotton cloth, and local specialties are sluggish. Fuzhou oranges are expensive due to low production, with prices reaching over 20,000 per catty.</p>
<p>[Our Pan Yang Office, 12th] The Pan Yang market fluctuated after the Spring Festival, and daily necessities rose by another 20%. Commercial banks barely survived the old year.

<h3>North China Campaign to Suppress Rebellion and Nation-Building Joint Committee to be Established in Beiping This Month</h3>

<h3>Five Arrested Students in Beiping Sent to Court for Trial; Police Department Also Issues Written Statement</h3>
<p>[Our Beiping Office, 12th] The five students from Peking University, Tsinghua University, and Fu Jen Catholic University who were arrested, Song Guozhu, Zheng Xuechun, Fan Guangdou, Gao Tongqing, and Deng Teqian, were sent to the court by the Garrison Headquarters yesterday. The Garrison Headquarters issued a written statement in response to the criticism from the outside world regarding whether the arrest and trial violated the Constitution, stating: Article 8 of the Constitution clearly stipulates that, except for the exception that "the arrest of a flagrant offender shall be otherwise determined by law...", the Garrison Headquarters arrested them based on the Measures for Handling Communist Party Members in the Rear Areas. Because they were all committing crimes, they were all flagrant offenders according to the Criminal Procedure Law, so the Garrison Headquarters had the right to arrest them. Regarding the issue of whether the interrogation by the Garrison Headquarters was legal, the National Government instructed on November 29, 1947, to change the phrase "transfer to a judicial organ with jurisdiction within the statutory time" in Article 8 of the Measures for Handling Communist Party Members in the Rear Areas to "transfer to a military law organ within the statutory time." However, in order to take care of the students, there was also an order instructing: "Students in schools who are suspected of being Communist Party members should first be sent to the judicial organs for trial." Since the Garrison Headquarters has the power of military law trial, it is not subject to the restriction of transferring to the court within 24 hours at the latest.</p>
<h3>The Weather in Shenyang is Warming Up</h3>

<h3>Repatriation of Returned Overseas Chinese from the Dutch East Indies; Registration to be Processed on Schedule</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Guangzhou, 12th] The repatriation of returned overseas Chinese from the Dutch East Indies was previously unable to be carried out due to the impact of the war in that area. Now that the war in the Dutch East Indies has ended, the Guangzhou Office of the Far East Bureau of the United Nations International Refugee Organization has been ordered to start registration in order to transfer the number of repatriated people and locations to the Dutch East Indies for negotiation. The date of departure will still have to wait until the Dutch East Indies government confirms it before a public announcement can be made. In Guangzhou and the Siyi area, registration will be held at the Guangzhou Overseas Chinese Affairs Office on February 23. In Qiongyai, it will be handled by the Haikou Overseas Chinese Affairs Office. Overseas Chinese who register for repatriation must have returned to China during World War II and hold valid documents issued by the local government in order to be valid.</p>
<h3>Han Chinese Merchants Persecuted in Tibet</h3>
<p>[Our Chongqing Office, 12th] It is reported that Han Chinese merchants Ji Junxian, Lü Da, and Li Xumin in Qamdo were recently poisoned and beaten by subordinates of Lhalu Galun, the chief administrator of Tibet in Qamdo, and were forced to leave the country.

<h3>Two Main Culprits in the Armed Drug Trafficking Case in Xichang Sentenced to Death</h3>
<p>[Our Chongqing Office, 12th] The armed drug trafficking case in Xichang, which caused a sensation, was solved by the Xichang Garrison Headquarters after several months of investigation. The Xing Yuan specially sent cadres to conduct a joint trial. It has been learned that the main culprits Peng Kaihua and Li Yaoqing were sentenced to death, and Yang Junqing was sentenced to life imprisonment. The Xing Yuan has telegraphed the Xichang Garrison Headquarters to execute them on the spot.</p>
<h3>Jiangxi Province Requests Industrial Loans to Save the Industrial Crisis</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanchang, 12th] Jiangxi Province's industry, whose foundation was not stable before the war, has been affected by price and financial fluctuations in recent years, and 93 factories have closed down one after another. Only 72 factories remain to date. In order to save the industrial crisis, the Jiangxi Construction Department is consulting with the Four Banks Branch to hold industrial loans in order.</p>
<h3>Civil Service Evaluation and Selection to Continue Under Existing Laws and Regulations; Registration Deadline Rumor is Inaccurate</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Office, 12th] Regarding the recent rumor that the registration method for civil service evaluation and selection ended at the end of last year, a person in charge of the Civil Service Evaluation and Selection Department stated: "The rumor does not correspond to the facts." However, the qualifications stipulated in the current laws and regulations on civil service appointment, grade selection, and registration, except for passing the examination, are in conflict with the second half of Article 85 of this law, which stipulates that those who have not passed the examination shall not be appointed. Previously, amendments have been drafted separately and submitted to the Examination Yuan, which is being reviewed in accordance with the Constitution. All evaluation and selection laws and regulations that conflict with the Constitution should have been submitted separately for amendment or repeal before the implementation of the Constitution. However, because some are closely related to the Civil Service Appointment Law, they cannot be amended or repealed until the amendment to the Civil Service Appointment Law is promulgated. Some also need to wait until the new law is promulgated before they can be repealed. There are also cases where it seems that they should be repealed immediately, but they cannot be temporarily applied due to factual needs. The circumstances are different, and they should be handled separately. According to Item 1 of the Program Law for the End of Political Tutelage, the powers prescribed by the original laws and regulations exercised by the National Government shall cease on the day the president elected in accordance with the Constitution takes office. Therefore, in the period after the implementation of the Constitution and before the president takes office, the old law is still effective if the new law has not been promulgated. Based on the above principles, this city has already listed and submitted for approval the existing various evaluation and selection laws and regulations that conflict with the Constitution and should be amended or repealed, as well as the handling situation. Instructions have not yet been received. Before various laws and regulations have been ordered to be repealed or amended, they will continue to be applied temporarily.</p>

<h3>After the Katayama Cabinet Resigns En Masse, the New Cabinet in Japan is Stillborn; Ashida is the Focus of Attention for the Prime Minister's Seat; Yoshida Attempts to Monopolize Power and Refuses to Attend the Four-Party Meeting</h3>
<p>[New Asia News Agency Comprehensive Report] Since Mr. Katayama proposed the resignation en masse at the cabinet meeting on the 8th, activities in various aspects have been particularly active. According to a Tokyo dispatch on the 12th, the Katayama cabinet decided to resign en masse in the last cabinet meeting on the morning of the 11th, and Katayama Tetsuji submitted his resignation to the Emperor at 11:30 a.m. and notified the two houses of the Senate and the House of Representatives at 11:40 a.m. Before the formal resignation en masse, Prime Minister Katayama had already issued a statement on the resignation en masse, the gist of which was: "The resignation en masse of the cabinet today is the inevitable result of the united cabinet. I am fortunate that I have not made any mistakes in the development of Japanese democracy. In particular, I have tried my best to avoid dissolving the House of Representatives and causing the cabinet to resign en masse, which is the result of a fair judgment on the domestic and foreign political situation. As for the future cabinet, in the current situation where there is no absolute majority party, I think it is more appropriate to organize a united cabinet, because a united cabinet can increase foreign confidence in Japan, and Japan's economy can be restored. Although the cabinet has resigned en masse today, it is closer to the ideals of us and others." In the House of Representatives, after learning of the cabinet's decision to resign en masse, it convened a parliamentary management committee on the 10th to discuss the nomination of the new prime minister in accordance with Article 67 of the new constitution. In the meeting, the Democratic Party advocated convening a consultation between the leaders of the four major political parties, while the small faction rose up in opposition. Based on this resolution, the Speaker of the House of Representatives, Matsuoka, visited the leaders of the Democratic Party, Ashida, the Socialist Party, Katayama, and the National Cooperative Party, Sanda, respectively on the morning of the 11th to exchange views. The three people agreed to convene a meeting of the leaders of the four parties. Then Matsuoka went to see Yoshida, the president of the Liberal Party, but Yoshida still insisted on opposing it, believing that since the Liberal Party is the largest opposition party, it should naturally tend to the regime. Therefore, the organization of the next cabinet still needs several days of compromise. However, in a speech at the cadre meeting held by the Liberal Party on the 12th, Yoshida Shigeru seemed to have expressed his willingness to compromise on the issue of the four-party coalition cabinet, but the Liberal Party should obtain the position of prime minister in the coalition cabinet. In the House of Councilors, the Green Breeze Society expressed its support for Mr. Yoshida, believing that Mr. Yoshida was nominated as the next prime minister with the qualifications of the president of the largest opposition party, which is "the constitutional path." General observers believe that the resignation en masse of the Katayama cabinet was premature, which caused Yoshida's conservative new party movement to fail to succeed. Because the conservative new party movement was not mature, the performance of the Democratic and National Cooperative parties is still to support the four-party coalition cabinet and not sympathize with Mr. Yoshida's proposal. As of the date of the Katayama cabinet's resignation en masse, the power of the various parties in the House of Representatives is as follows: 123 seats for the Socialist Party, 119 seats for the Liberal Party, 106 seats for the Democratic Party, 32 seats for the National Cooperative Party, 22 seats for the Comrade Association, 16 seats for the All-Farmers' Party, 15 seats for the First Member Club, 7 seats for the Farmers' Party, 4 seats for the Communist Party, 2 seats for independents, and 20 vacancies. Under the above-mentioned distribution of power, if some external pressure is added, the possibility of a coalition cabinet of all parties uniting the country is the greatest, but the nomination of the prime minister is still a major problem. According to the current situation, it seems that Mr. Keda has a greater chance of being elected.</p>
<p>[United News Agency, Tokyo, 12th] The Katayama cabinet resigned because the left and right wings of the Social Democratic Party had already resigned on the 10th, but they remained in office to await the parliament's appointment of a new prime minister.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 11th] The future cabinet may still be composed of parties that organize a coalition government, and the prime minister will be Ashida Hitoshi.</p>
<h3>The Opinions of the Various Parties in Japan are Divided; The Secretaries-General of the Four Major Parties Hold a Meeting to Discuss the Basic Policy for the Next Prime Minister</h3>
<p>[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 12th] Because Matsuoka, the Speaker of the Japanese House of Representatives, failed to convene a meeting of the leaders of the four parties, in order to quickly decide the issue of the next prime minister, he held a meeting of the secretaries-general of the Liberal, Democratic, Socialist, and National Cooperative parties at 2:15 p.m. on the 12th. First, Matsuoka reported on the process of failing to convene a meeting of the leaders of the four parties, and then proposed whether representatives of small factions should also participate in the meeting. Ohno, the secretary-general of the Liberal Party, was the first to express his approval and decided that from tomorrow onwards, each small faction should also send one representative to participate in the talks.</p>
<p>Also in the meeting, Ohno said: "President Yoshida's opinion is to hope to organize a conservative coalition cabinet centered on the Liberal Party, but intends not to dissolve the parliament as much as possible." Tomibechi, the secretary-general of the Democratic Party, said: "A national coalition cabinet is the most appropriate, and any other cabinet cannot be approved," implying an opinion against the Liberal Party. Okada, the secretary-general of the National Cooperative Party, immediately expressed his support for the proposal, and it is clear that a common front between the Democratic and National Cooperative parties has been established. Asanuma, the secretary-general of the Socialist Party, said: "The attitude of the Socialist Party has not yet been decided," reserving its attitude. After the meeting, Matsuoka told reporters: "The basic policy for the next prime minister has been decided. In tomorrow's meeting, it can probably be established. In the future, the act of nominating and electing the prime minister by the members of the parliament is just a lot of talk. In short, we will work hard to decide it as soon as possible."</p>
<h3>Britain Will Reduce Its Occupation Forces in Japan</h3>
<p>[Report] London, 12th broadcast: Tonight, the three ministries of the Army, Navy, and Air Force announced that Britain will greatly reduce the United Kingdom's occupation forces in Japan.

According to a spokesman for the Army Department, the current United Kingdom troops stationed in Japan are about 2,000 to 3,000 people. As for how many will be left after the reduction, it was not mentioned.</p>
<p>Collecting evidence of Japan's poisoning of China</p>
<h3>Ji Nan Demands Judgment: Tojo and Others Should Be Sentenced to Death; Collecting Evidence of Japanese Poisoning of China</h3>
<p>[United Press Tokyo, 12th] The prosecution of the Far East International Military Tribunal on the 12th continued to present evidence point by point to demonstrate the crimes of Tojo and his accomplices. The prosecution stated: Japan presided over the sale of narcotics in China to weaken Chinese resistance and used the profits to conquer the world. The profits from narcotics were so substantial that the puppet Manchukuo claimed that this income was second only to customs revenue. "Young female attendants were employed in 'swallows' nests,' and narcotics were sold in brothels to make opium and narcotics consumption more attractive." Japan implemented aggressive economic policies in China, shamelessly claiming that it would use the surplus to support the Japanese army. Chief Prosecutor Ji Nan requested the court on the morning of the 11th to sentence all defendants to the most severe punishment.</p>
<h3>Kashmir Case: India Requests Postponement of Discussion</h3>

<h3>Two Million People Participate in Grand Ceremony; Mahatma's Ashes Scattered in Ganges River; 79 Cannons Fired in Salute</h3>
<p>[United Press Allahabad, India, 12th] Two million Indians stood on the banks of the sacred Ganges River on the 12th, tearfully watching the ashes of their martyred leader, Gandhi, being scattered on the water to attain immortal fame. The special train carrying the ashes arrived in the holy city of Allahabad from New Delhi at exactly 9:00 AM. Indians lined both sides of the railway tracks for miles to welcome it. At the same time, several planes flew back and forth in the sky, scattering flowers. Gandhi's ashes were stored in a bronze urn, which was then taken from the train and placed on a three-colored flower bed on a funeral boat, which sailed towards the riverbank.</p>
<p>The ceremony lasted for one hour. It was originally planned to scatter the ashes at the confluence of the Ganges and Yamuna Rivers at 12:30 AM, but it was slightly delayed due to the large crowd. Indian Prime Minister Nehru and Home Minister Patel had arrived earlier to welcome the special train. Nehru looked somber, his face filled with sorrow. He personally led many cabinet ministers onto the funeral boat and proceeded to the riverbank. As the train entered the station, Gandhi's granddaughters sang Indian elegies. When the urn of ashes was moved into the boat, dignitaries stood by with their heads bowed, and the military saluted. Before the special train arrived at this location, it had stopped for ten hours at the small station of Rosa Rabad because there were no guards on the train, fearing a rush by the crowds. Although the guards arrived later, the surging crowds could not be stopped. Many people paid their respects with their hands clasped together in the Indian custom, and some cried aloud. At 9:45 AM, led by five armored vehicles, the procession slowly advanced towards the Ganges River. A monk sang elegies at the head of the procession, followed by mounted police and Gurkha infantry, with their guns held downward. As far as the eye could see, the fields to the left were filled with Indians like mountains and seas, with thousands of bonfires and swirling smoke, making the sky above the holy city look like a dense accumulation of clouds.</p>
<p>[Reuters New Delhi, 11th] Gandhi's ashes were transported today by a special army train to Allahabad, where they will be scattered at the confluence of the Ganges and Yamuna Rivers. At that time, 79 cannons, representing Gandhi's 79 years of age, will fire a salute every two minutes. Simultaneously, ceremonies will be held at 50 Hindu holy sites across the country, with an estimated participation of over ten million people from various religious backgrounds.</p>

<p>The Spread of War Made One Think of the Vatican</p>
<p>The war between the Soviet Union and Finland was being waged in the snows of the north. Finnish heroism had turned the easy conquest expected by the Soviet Union into a fierce three-month war.</p>
<p>Although this war added two to the list of belligerent countries, Europe was filled with rumors of peace activities throughout the last months of 1939. The stalemate period after the collapse of Poland created a good reason for peace rumors and gestures. These concerned me because they consistently linked the United States with ongoing peace movements.</p>
<p>As early as October 2, 1939, the US Minister to Romania, Gunther, telegraphed me that the Romanian Foreign Minister expressed deep interest in the possibility of the US President launching a peace movement. The next day, I telegraphed back that there was no intention to carry out such a movement, and that we had not received any indication from any belligerent country requesting us to launch a peace initiative. Hitler, in his speech on October 6, put forward empty peace proposals—of course, this peace would allow him to retain most of what he had seized in the war, as well as Czechoslovakia and Austria. After he delivered his speech, Ambassador to Belgium Davis cabled the President and me, saying that a certain authoritative source (later learned to be King Leopold of Belgium) requested him to state: Only the President could prevent Germany from attacking Western Europe, and Belgium very much hoped that the President could make an effort, as he had done in previous crises.</p>
<p>On the same day (October 7), our Counselor in Berlin, Kirk, cabled that a certain person close to Hitler suggested that the President could use Hitler's speech as an opportunity to send a secret message to Hitler, agreeing with "his peace efforts" and requesting him to clarify his basic principles for establishing peace. Two days later, Kirk cabled that the German spokesman said that if the President suggested a truce and negotiated peace, the German side could accept it, and he also indicated that the German side could participate in a conference far from the war zone (some people thought this referred to Washington). The next day, US Minister to Finland Schoenfeld cabled, conveying the Finnish Foreign Minister's suggestion that the United States could initiate an exploration of the possibility of peace. After receiving so many cables of the same nature, I convened my colleagues on Sunday, October 8, and held a meeting in my office. I invited Davis to attend, as I often invited him to participate in discussions when I especially needed his insights and long experience. We had already had a very detailed discussion on whether the United States could take reasonable action to restore peace in Europe at this time.</p>
<p>At this Sunday meeting, we reviewed a draft of suggestions that the United States might make. In it, we would ask the belligerent countries to state their peace terms; declare our willingness to act as an intermediary, passing on communications on this issue to the opposing belligerent countries. After exchanging many opinions, I stated that I did not think that the United States launching a peace movement at this time could have a significant effect.</p>
<p>Because Hitler had always been the victor, any action we could take in terms of peace would only benefit him and discourage the Allies. We had no reason to force Britain and France to make peace under such conditions. Once we made a peace proposal to Britain and France, it would put them in the wrong position. If they accepted, they would have to agree to most of Hitler's terms; if they refused, they would bear the blame for rejecting peace.</p>
<p>Our decision not to take action did not prevent the continued spread of rumors. We seemed to feel that many of these rumors came from Germany, partly to make people believe that Hitler had always been ready for peace, and another purpose was to confuse the Allies with rumors of separate peace and aggression.</p>
<p>On November 5, Counselor Kirk cabled from Berlin that Schacht said that if he received a guarantee of an audience with the President to present his views on resolving the European dispute, he would be willing to come to the United States for non-political talks. Kirk also reported that he had recently noticed the same efforts of a completely unofficial nature, but he warned us not to attach too much importance to them because the decision on war and peace continued to rest with Hitler.</p>
<p>In our view, Schacht's actions seemed to be part of the German government's overall effort to contact other governments through unofficial personnel. These unofficial personnel appeared to be completely unrelated to the German government, and in some ways, they were even opposed to the German government.</p>
<p>When King Leopold of Belgium suddenly went to The Hague to jointly mediate an end to the war with Queen Wilhelmina of the Netherlands, Ambassador Davis telegraphed the President and me on November 7 that Germany would attack the Netherlands on November 9, which prompted their action. The Dutch Minister, Loudon, came to see me on the 9th, his emotions very agitated. He gave a note from his government to the President and me, which said that the neutrality of Belgium and the Netherlands would be violated in a few days or even hours. On November 11, the President replied by telegram to King Leopold of Belgium and Queen Wilhelmina of the Netherlands, reiterating his friendship but without making any firm statement.</p>
<p>On December 14, Ambassador to France Bullitt cabled from Paris about what the French Foreign Minister, Li Jia, had told him. According to Li Jia, Mussolini was trying to promote a premature peace in order to maintain the Nazi regime of the Axis powers and to protect his own regime in Italy. Li Jia believed that Mussolini wanted to restore the basic principles of the Four-Power Pact of Britain, France, Germany, and Italy that Italy had proposed in 1933.</p>
<p>At the same time, the President and we discussed plans to establish relations with the Vatican. In early July, two months before the outbreak of war, Charmers discussed with me the benefits we could obtain from such a relationship. We felt that the Vatican had information in many areas, especially about what was happening in Germany, Italy, and Spain, which we did not have. At my suggestion, Welles wrote a private letter to US Ambassador to Rome, Phillips, seeking his opinion. On July 19, Phillips' reply suggested establishing diplomatic relations and appointing a Protestant as the US representative. Welles gave this letter to the President.</p>
<p>In conversations with the President, I argued that we could not send a formal ambassador to the Vatican, but only a personal representative of the President to negotiate with the Pope. I agreed with Phillips' suggestion that this representative should be a Protestant. Britain followed this procedure, appointing a Protestant as the Minister to the Vatican and another Catholic as the First Secretary in the Ministry. I also said that if he took this step, he would receive the same cooperation from other church leaders in America. Ambassador Phillips in Rome telegraphed me on September 25 that the Vatican's "Osservatore Romano" had given full and objective coverage to the President's neutrality message to Congress. I sent the original telegram to the President for reference.</p>
<p>Then on October 2, the President sent me a very long memorandum. The memorandum began by saying: "This is an idea that I just thought of, and I haven't discussed it with anyone else." He anticipated that after the end of the war, whether it was soon, or another summer, or three, five years, there would be a large number of refugees, including Christians and Jews, from various countries, even Britain, France, and Italy.</p>
<p>The President continued: "For this reason, I wonder if you and I should start considering discussing the whole issue with the Vatican, the American Council of Churches, and similar institutions in Europe while the war is going on. Contact with the Jews has already been achieved through the Myron Taylor Committee.</p>
<p>"But contact with the Catholics should be directly with the Vatican itself, because this issue is more important to the Catholic Church in Europe than to the Catholic Church in the United States.</p>
<p>"Therefore, I think that although there is no special reason to rush, we might consider sending a special envoy or ambassador to the Vatican in the future so that we can have a direct communication system on the European Catholic refugee problem."</p>
<p>In his memorandum, the President suggested sending a diplomatic representative to the Pope entirely on the basis of the refugee problem. He did not mention the point that the Vatican could be a factor in achieving peace, although that point was extremely important to him later.</p>
<p>On October 10, he sent me another memorandum about Ambassador Phillips' report that the "Osservatore Romano" had published the President's neutrality message to Congress. Mr. Roosevelt said: "For various reasons, I think you might as well send a telegram to Phillips along the following lines: 'Please explain to the Papal Foreign Minister when it is convenient for you. The President is pleased that the "Osservatore Romano" has published American news in an impartial manner.'" I sent a telegram to Phillips on October 11 as directed, and on October 20, I received his reply that the Pope was pleased with the President's telegram.</p>
<p>After weeks of propaganda on the Vatican's side, I telegraphed Phillips on December 23, telling him the content of the President's Christmas letter to the Pope. This letter would be made public the next day, and the President would also announce that Myron Taylor had been appointed as the envoy to the Vatican. The original letter was sent through Archbishop Spellman of New York (now a Cardinal) to representatives of several denominations in Washington. The President also sent the same letter to Dr. White Patrick, President of the Federal Council of Churches of Christ in America, a Protestant leader, and Dr. Adler, President of the Jewish Theological Seminary of America. No one could have been more suitable for Taylor's appointment than he was. He had broad wisdom and extraordinary knowledge. In addition to his work at the Vatican, he also became an active member in our work to initiate and promote the outline of a world peace organization.</p>
<p>Taylor set out for Europe in February 1940, and our new relationship with the Vatican began. The Pope seemed to have the same realistic view of the European peace issue as we did. He was determined not to propose a solution unless a lasting peace could be achieved. This opportunity would not come until Germany was disintegrated.</p>
<h3>Turkey Determined to Resist Aggression; US Considering Increasing Aid to Greece and Turkey</h3>

<h3>This City's Conscription for This Year is Six Thousand - Ordered to be Completed Before the End of June - The Garrison District is Actively Carrying Out Preparatory Work - Over Two Thousand Veterans Arrive in Shanghai from Tianjin</h3>
<p>This city's conscription for this year was originally planned to be carried out in two phases. The first phase had a quota of three thousand six hundred men, to be completed before the end of March, and the second phase had a quota of two thousand four hundred men, to be completed before the end of September. The authorities, in order to simplify procedures, have now combined the two phases into one, that is, a total of six thousand men are to be conscripted, to be completed before the end of June. The Shanghai Garrison District has already received this order, and preparatory work is actively underway.</p>
<p>Furthermore, over two thousand veterans from the Fifth Provisional Rehabilitation Institute for Veterans under the Joint Logistics Headquarters, led by Director Liu Fusheng, arrived in Shanghai from Tianjin on the Haili ship at 5 PM on the 11th. Party Chief Fang of the Kuomintang City Party Committee, as well as You Ziqing from the representative comfort delegation, Zhao Xiangchu and Luo Zhenglun from the Encouragement Society, and many others, including Lu Huimin and Xie Yonghua from the Women's Association, went to the pier to greet them. When the Haili ship docked, cannons were fired and music was played to welcome them. Chief Fang delivered a brief welcoming speech on behalf of all sectors, with many words of encouragement. Then, the Big Baby Drama Troupe performed various entertainment acts, which were extremely wonderful. The committee of all sectors in this city for receiving and comforting soldiers passing through on their way to the front also presented comfort items and a large number of books and periodicals. It is heard that after this batch of veterans disembarks, they will transfer to a train to go to a certain place for recuperation.</p>
<p>Director Fang of the Kuomintang City Party Committee, who previously accepted the invitation of Commander-in-Chief Guo of the Joint Logistics Headquarters and Colonel Boben, Advisor to the US Military in China, to go to Beijing to visit the barracks of new recruits passing through the capital, has already completed his mission and returned to Shanghai on the night train on the 9th to preside over the Spring Festival celebration for comforting the troops. Fang stated to reporters yesterday: "I felt very pleased to be invited to visit the barracks for new recruits passing through the capital this time. On the morning of the 9th, I was accompanied by senior officials of the Joint Logistics Headquarters to visit the barracks in the Xiaguan Pukou area. The facilities in the barracks everywhere are very complete, and the surrounding environment is also very beautiful. The new recruits all expressed their satisfaction with the warm reception from all sectors in the capital, and their morale was also boosted." Fang also said that Shanghai was the first in the country to initiate the reception of new recruits passing through, and with the support of enthusiastic people in recent months, it has been quite successful and has been highly praised by Chairman Chiang and central figures. He hopes that enthusiastic people will continue to support it in the future, and strive to improve the accommodation of new recruits in order to increase the strength to quell the rebellion. It is also learned that Fang plans to invite Mayor Wu and leaders from all sectors in the near future to discuss matters related to the reception of new recruits.</p>
<h3>Spring Festival Comfort for New Recruits - Chief Fang Encourages Efforts to Suppress Bandits - Gifts Distributed and Emotions are High</h3>
<p>The Spring Festival troop comfort movement in this city was held in districts on the morning of the 10th, and the atmosphere was extremely enthusiastic. In Jiangwan, under the leadership of Director Fang of the Kuomintang City Party Committee, a comfort rally was held at the New Recruit Model Camp in the sports field at 9 AM, attended by more than four thousand new recruits. Chief Fang presided over the meeting and delivered an impromptu speech entitled "Knowing Shame, Teaching War, Welcoming the Spring Festival." Fang briefly stated: "Last year can be considered the most difficult year since the victory of the Anti-Japanese War. The flames of war have not been extinguished, and prices have soared. After eight years of arduous resistance against Japan, with heavy sacrifices, the country could have been restored and built, and the people could have lived and worked in peace, but due to the trouble and destruction caused by the Communist bandits, the work of restoration and construction cannot be carried out, and the people's lives are miserable, living in deep water and scorching fire. In the places where the bandit troops arrive, they universally launch struggles and liquidations, create class hatred, promote 'land revolution', instruct unemployed vagrants and hooligans to control the countryside, oppress good peasants, and make everyone have no food to eat, and encourage siblings to kill each other, forcing women to serve as comfort troupe members, implementing the so-called 'public wife system' for the lust of the bandit army cadres. Intellectuals are labeled as 'cultural landlords' and also suffer tragic killings. After the victory, we have already become one of the five great powers, but now our international status has plummeted. It can be said that this kind of pain and shame are all inflicted on us by the Communist bandits. We must 'know shame', recognize that the Communist bandits' rebellion is a great shame and humiliation for the country. After knowing shame, we must be brave to 'avenge shame', use our blood and flesh to wash away the shame and strive for glory. How can we 'avenge shame'? We must 'teach war', fight for saving the country and the people, fight for construction and revitalization, fight for freedom and light, fight for democracy and constitutional government. Everyone must have the determination to fight, take on the responsibility of fighting, work hard to suppress bandits and kill thieves, and complete the task of quelling the rebellion and saving the country," and so on. After the speech, various wonderful entertainment acts were performed, and each person was given a bar of soap, a box of sweets, a pack of cigarettes, and pork. The new recruits were all very happy and dispersed at 1 PM.</p>
<h3>The Eighth Comfort Team Comforts Troops at Longhua Temple</h3>
<p>Also on this day, all sectors of Shanghai organized a comfort team to comfort the wounded soldiers in the local wounded soldiers' hospital and the soldiers in the new recruit camps passing through. The leader of the Eighth Comfort Team, Wan Molin, led all the members of the Brothers Technical Troupe to the garrison site of Longhua Temple at 9:30 AM to comfort the new recruits passing through the area. The Brothers Technical Troupe performed technical skills and distributed comfort items, with each person receiving four taels of pork, a bar of soap, a pack of cigarettes, and a bag of sweets. All the soldiers were extremely excited. They did not disperse until 1 PM.</p>
<h3>The Quelling Rebellion Propaganda Team Gives Speeches for Days</h3>

<h3>Destitute in a Foreign Land, Impoverished at the End of the Year, Intellectual Laments Bankruptcy of Reputation, Swallows Poison in Court Seeking Death, Hu Diya Not Out of Danger, Details the Ordeal on His Sickbed</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper News] Hu Diya, the editing director of the China United News Agency, was accused of theft by Zhu Haiping, the vice president of the agency. Yesterday, when the court opened for interrogation, Hu, due to the impact on his reputation and under economic pressure, swallowed mercury cyanide in court and committed suicide. The court sent him to Guangci Hospital for treatment. After the doctor's stomach pumping, the cyanide was still in his intestines, and as of press time, he had not yet escaped danger. Yesterday, the reporter rode in a rickshaw to Guangci Hospital and visited this "colleague" who attempted suicide. He was lying in a third-class ward on the third floor of Guangci Hospital, wearing an old navy blue suit, with disheveled hair and a haggard face. Seeing the reporter come, he seemed extremely excited and struggled to support his frail body to describe the theft accusation and the suicide attempt.</p>
<p>First, he showed the reporter a card, "China United News Agency Employee Certificate," with "Hu Diya, 26 years old, Sichuan, Editing Director, President Zhang Cangping" written on the inside, to prove his identity. He continued, "I graduated from the journalism department of Shanghai Law College. During the Anti-Japanese War, the school was in Wanxian. I came to Shanghai last July to find a job. Because Zhang used to teach at Shanghai Law College in Wanxian, he was now also the president of China United News Agency, so he introduced me to the agency to serve as the editing director. However, there were very few staff members in the agency, with only the editing director and two stencil writers. Since I started working in the agency until now, for about six months, I have only received a salary of 4.26 million yuan, which has made me extremely poor."</p>
<p>After that, Zhang Cangping returned to his hometown to run for election, and the agency's affairs were handled by Vice President Song Haiping, who also lived in the agency (No. 42, Lane 10, Qiujiang Branch Road). Due to a misunderstanding over the issue of sending out manuscripts, Song developed a bad impression of me. I also thought about going to Hankou to find another job and borrowed 2 million yuan from Song for travel expenses. Song did not agree to lend it, so I asked to sell the old newspapers stored in the agency to use the proceeds as travel expenses, but Song also refused. Because I was stranded in a foreign land with no relatives or friends to turn to, I borrowed nothing. On the morning of the 3rd of this month, taking advantage of Song's absence from the agency, I loaded 108 catties of old newsprint and 58.5 catties of local newspapers stored in the agency onto a rickshaw and sold them for 2.13 million yuan. In the afternoon, I returned to the agency and said to Song with a smile, 'I'm sorry, I've sold the old newspapers.'"</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, Song put on a stern face at this time and called the police station, reporting me for theft. The Wujin Road Police Station transferred me to the Hongkou Police Branch. On the 4th of this month, the Hongkou Branch transferred me to the procuratorate. After questioning, the prosecutor found that the situation was not very serious and allowed bail. After being released on bail, I could not leave Shanghai to find another job, my reputation was damaged, and my pockets were empty. I could no longer live in the China United News Agency, so I stayed in a small inn. It was right during the Lunar New Year, and the drums were noisy in the streets, which increased the stimulation. I decided to commit suicide. First, under the pretext of a blood test, I asked the doctor to draw a tube of blood to write four letters in blood, one to the Journalists Association and three letters separately to Shen Bao, Xinwen Bao, and Da Gong Bao, reporting the facts, hoping that my reputation could be maintained after my death. These four blood letters are currently stored in the procuratorate. I also bought a piece of mercury cyanide (mercurial agent), prepared for suicide when necessary.</p>
<p>Today (the 12th), the procuratorate summoned me and Song to court for questioning again in the morning. In court, the prosecutor advocated reconciliation. I felt that even if reconciliation, my reputation had been damaged, and after reconciliation, my life would have no sustenance. I suddenly felt that life was meaningless, so I swallowed the pre-purchased cyanide in the procuratorate, determined to commit suicide. After being discovered by the bailiffs, I was rushed to Guangci Hospital for emergency treatment. This is the story of being accused of theft and attempting suicide." Because Hu had been talking for a long time, his breathing was rapid. At the end, he dug out 15,000 yuan in legal tender from his pocket and said with a bitter smile, "This is all I have left!" When the reporter walked out of Guangci Hospital, he saw that Shanghai was bathed in the New Year atmosphere of firecrackers and drums. Who would have thought that in another corner, this tragedy was being played out for "2 million yuan"?</p>

<h3>Rumors of Opening Up Navigation Rights on the Yangtze River - Shipping Industry Rejects it as Absurd - Sees it as Malicious Propaganda Damaging Sino-US Relations</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper News] In recent days, it has been rumored that US aid to China will have the opening up of navigation rights on the Yangtze River as an attached condition. The person in charge of the National Federation of Shipping Industries said that this is an absurd rumor and denounced it as malicious propaganda damaging Sino-US relations. It is said that "The United States has always adopted a highly protective policy for its own shipping industry. This policy has been strengthened repeatedly in the past ten years. The funds used for shipbuilding often account for a major part of the national expenditure. Coastal and inland river navigation is limited to ships flying the American flag. Therefore, the American government and people can understand and support our people's struggle to maintain coastal and inland river navigation rights and oppose 'four-port trade' on the Yangtze River. This kind of friendship and justice has long won the resonance of the Chinese nation. Now, at a time when the Communist bandits are rampant and threatening world peace, we are in even more urgent need of the timely realization of various American spiritual and material assistance to alleviate the current scourge. This kind of assistance is based on standing together in times of trouble and jointly planning for security. There must be no conditions for exchange. In particular, 450 million people cherish the navigation rights that China has only recently recovered. The Chinese government authorities have also repeatedly stated that there is no possibility of changing the protection policy, which should be known to all friendly countries. Therefore, the current widespread rumors of opening up navigation rights on the Yangtze River, allowing ships flying foreign flags to enter unimpeded, have no signs to be found. It can be asserted that it is an atmosphere created by a few people who attempt to re-enjoy navigation privileges in China to confuse the public. We can only be more vigilant to ensure the integrity of navigation rights."</p>

<h3>A Dancehall Star's Enthusiasm Wanes - Two Chairmen Sun Hongyuan et al. Regain Freedom on Lunar New Year's Eve - Dance Hostesses Involved to be Transferred to the Procuratorate</h3>
<p>The industry association chairman Sun Hongyuan and the labor union chairman Tang Zongjie (in relation to the dance hostesses and dance industry workers who destroyed the Social Affairs Bureau incident) were released on bail around 2 am on the 10th morning (i.e. late on New Year's Eve in the lunar calendar) with the approval of the police bureau, after continuous requests from dancehall peers and lawyer Chen Tingrui, each putting up a reputable shop as a guarantor. As for another director of the independent labor union, Hu Yunyuan, and seven dance hostesses and 25 workers with more serious allegations, they are to be transferred to the procuratorate for trial. At that time, Sun Hongyuan and Tang Zongjie, who are out on bail, and dance hostess representatives Sun Zhimin, Jin Meihong, and Meng Yan will all be summoned to appear in court. According to reporters, since the incident of destruction occurred, the stars of each dancehall have felt a sense of decline, and many have not returned to the dance floor to resume their livelihood. Even those famous figures in the dance industry such as Meng Yan and Sun Zhimin, who represented the dance hostess petitioning group, have not returned to their original dancehalls and have secretly hidden their whereabouts, as if they were recluses in the dance world, reversing their past active situation. Therefore, although dancehalls are approaching the Spring Festival, business is not very prosperous.</p>
<h3>Workers Arrested at Shenxin Factory: 198 Released, Yang Guangming and Hu Binliang Admit to Joining the Communist Party, 38 Others Suspected of Serious Crimes Under Continued Interrogation</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch] According to yesterday's announcement by the Municipal Government Information Office: Following the labor strike at Shenxin No. 9 Factory on Macau Road, this city, over two hundred workers with suspicious behavior were arrested on the spot. Among them, 198 workers who were implicated innocently and whose offenses were relatively minor, have been released after representatives from the Shenxin No. 9 Aftermath Committee provided bail for them separately on the afternoon of the 9th. There are still 38 workers suspected of serious crimes who are being continuously interrogated by the police bureau. Among them, Yang Guangming and Hu Baoliang have admitted to being members of the Communist Party after interrogation. Their written confessions are as follows:</p>
<p>Yang Guangming: After Yang Guangming was arrested, the police bureau sent officers to interrogate him. The recorded transcript of the interrogation is as follows:</p>
<p>Name: Yang Guangming.</p>
<p>Age: 22 years old.</p>
<p>Hometown: Gaoyou.</p>
<p>Occupation: Coppersmith at Shenxin No. 9 Factory.</p>
<p>Residence: No. 16, Zone 4, Shenxin No. 9 Factory Workshop.</p>
<p>The person being interrogated was questioned by the preliminary hearing court of the Police Bureau on February 8th of this year regarding the Shenxin No. 9 Factory labor strike. The record is as follows:</p>
<p>Q: Who initiated the Shenxin No. 9 Factory labor strike?</p>
<p>A: To explain the reason for the Shenxin No. 9 Factory labor strike, it was because the factory stopped distributing two installments of rations. I heard that various departments had negotiated with the factory, and I, Yang Guangming, had also requested this from the chairman of the union, Mao Yuting, but there was no response. The coppersmiths all knew about this. After a week, the union and the factory had not responded, so this strike happened. There are too many departments in Shenxin No. 9 Factory, and each department had representatives participating. For example, there was Tan Xibao, and I recognize a face from the fine yarn department, but I can't say his name. There were almost more than one hundred representatives.</p>
<p>Q: Do you know the details of the organization of this strike?</p>
<p>A: Tan Xibao and others advocated for the election of representatives, Yang Changmin was in charge of leading the pickets, and I was the representative who spoke. After the machines were shut down, while preparing for the first negotiation with the factory, a Wang Zhongliang requested all the representatives to negotiate with the factory.</p>
<p>Q: Why did it escalate to closing the iron gates and preventing entry and exit? Who advocated this?</p>
<p>A: On the evening of the day the machines were shut down, which was two days before your police arrived, while we were negotiating with the factory, suddenly a person claiming to be a newspaper reporter came to Shenxin No. 9 Factory. We welcomed him very much. However, because this self-proclaimed newspaper reporter was acting mysteriously and was not prepared to conduct an interview, everyone wanted to see his identification. During the dispute, suddenly someone raised a pistol to demonstrate, so the workers were very surprised. Then, a worker named Yang Changmin snatched the gun and dragged him into the factory. I heard that Yang Changmin reported this to the Putuo Road branch office. It is said that this self-proclaimed newspaper reporter was sent by the Putuo branch office, so the iron gates were closed, and no one was allowed to enter without verifying their identity. This was advocated by someone surnamed Jin, whose name is not very clear, but I recognize his face.</p>
<p>Q: On the afternoon of that day, the military police and relevant authorities came to talk to you. Who opposed sending representatives out to negotiate?</p>
<p>A: After listening to the guidance of the officials from all sides, our worker representative, Yang Changmin, climbed over the iron gate at that time, intending to come out to negotiate, but the crowd was noisy, and some workers opposed it, so it was unsuccessful.</p>
<p>Q: Who designed the throwing of bricks, sprinkling nitric acid, and using tap water to attack the military police?</p>
<p>A: I don't know about this situation. Maybe Yang Changmin and the others know.</p>
<p>Q: Who directed the labor-management drama and taught the songs? Do you know?</p>
<p>A: I don't know this very well.</p>
<p>Q: What organizations have you participated in?</p>
<p>A: In the past, after the Chongqing Jiaochangkou incident, I was introduced by a Mr. Guo Chuhuai to join the Chinese Communist Party. Recently, I also became sworn brothers with Wang Zhongliang and 160 others. I have not participated in any other organizations.</p>
<p>Q: You joined the Communist Party in Chongqing and came to Shanghai to work. How did you contact them?</p>
<p>A: I came to Shanghai in July of 1946. I reported to the Fuzhou Road Labor Association and explained to the Labor Association that I was now working at Shenxin No. 9 Factory. After about a month, a Mr. Wang Yiming came to see me at Shenxin No. 9 Factory. At that time, he (referring to Wang) instructed me to be friendly with the workers, and if there were any good friends among the workers, to develop comrade relations as much as possible. After that, we met once a week.</p>
<p>Q: When was the last time you met with Wang Yiming before the Shenxin No. 9 Factory labor strike? Where did you meet him? Did he make an appointment with you for the next meeting, including the time and location?</p>
<p>A: The last time was two weeks ago, and I met Wang Yiming at the tram stop at the intersection of Seymour Road and Avenue Joffre. He made an appointment for me to meet him next time at the corner of Connaught Road and Jiaozhou Road, at 3 PM tomorrow (the 9th), for no more than three minutes. We will definitely meet.</p>
<p>Q: What does Wang Yiming look like?</p>
<p>A: He is a little shorter than me, not fat, not thin, and does not wear glasses. He wears student clothes and speaks with a local accent.</p>
<p>Q: Has Wang Yiming ever given you any instructions on how to work?</p>
<p>A: There were no specific instructions on work, but he asked me about the recent situation at Shenxin No. 9 Factory, and talked to me about the recent battles of the Communist army, as well as the recent student parades for the Hong Kong and Kowloon incident, which were completely patriotic movements, and that the government's repression was regrettable!</p>
<p>Q: Who introduced you to work at Shenxin No. 9 Factory?</p>
<p>A: My brother-in-law, Mei Wenkui, introduced me to Minister Ding of the Shenxin Factory.</p>
<p>Q: Where is your brother-in-law Mei Wenkui now?</p>
<p>A: He (referring to Mei) is also a coppersmith at Shenxin No. 9 Factory. He entered the factory with me after the victory. He (referring to Mei) is a relative of Minister Ding.</p>
<p>Q: After you entered Shenxin No. 9 Factory, how many comrade relations did you develop?</p>
<p>A: We need the following conditions to develop comrade relations:</p>
<p>(1) Must be literate, (2) Must be gentle, (3) Must have social awareness, (4) Must understand the international situation, (5) Must be able to keep secrets. There are too few people who meet the standards, so it was not until two months ago that I developed a comrade relationship with Hu Baoliang.</p>
<p>Q: Have you ever informed Wang Yiming that you developed a comrade with Hu Baoliang? Did Hu Baoliang fill out an application to join the party? Or a voluntary statement?</p>
<p>A: Hu Baoliang wrote a voluntary statement, which I have already handed over to Wang Yiming.</p>
<p>Q: Has Wang Yiming met with Hu Baoliang?</p>
<p>A: Not yet. Wang Yiming has not made an appointment with him.</p>
<p>Hu Binliang: Name: Hu Baoliang, 24 years old, Wuxi, worker in the coppersmith department of Shenxin No. 9 Factory. Address: No. 16, Zone 4 Workshop.</p>
<p>Q: Why did you join the Communist Party?</p>
<p>A: Because Yang Guangming, the representative of our coppersmiths, persuaded me to join.</p>
<p>Q: When did you join?</p>
<p>A: Half a month ago.</p>
<p>Q: When you joined the Communist Party, what did Yang Guangming give you?</p>
<p>A: Yang Guangming gave me a piece of paper with the main points of an autobiography, and told me to write it well within half a month and hand it to him, so I could join the Communist Party.</p>
<p>Q: Have you now handed over your autobiography to Yang Guangming?</p>
<p>A: Because I didn’t understand the meaning, Yang Guangming first wrote the main points on my autobiography paper, and I wrote an autobiography according to the main points and handed it to Yang Guangming. Yang Guangming then thought it was okay, so he returned the autobiography to me.</p>
<p>Q: Are there any other procedures?</p>
<p>A: No.</p>
<p>Q: Is this sheet of autobiography main points written with a pencil, which is Yang Guangming written for you?</p>
<p>A: Yes, Yang Guangming wrote it and handed it to me.</p>
<p>Q: Are these few sheets of autobiography written with foreign ink, written by you personally?</p>
<p>A: I wrote it myself, half a month ago.</p>
<p>Q: Where did you hand over your autobiography?</p>
<p>A: I handed it to him in Room 16, Zone 4 Workshop, after work in the factory.</p>

Other industrial and commercial banks are also contributing enthusiastically. The Spring Festival couplets for charity sale are currently being printed overnight. Chai Ruoyu, Chairman of the Provincial Farmers' Association, has already pre-purchased the first three pairs for 1.5 million yuan. Currently, the troop support work is in full swing.</p>
<p>Amid the promotion of frugality and the prohibition of gift-giving, a large advertisement for a "Spring Festival Grand Competition" was found in a local newspaper in the city. Upon closer reading, it stated, "In order to improve the quality of our products, our store has recently hired a new type of technician from Shanghai, specializing in the production of Southern candies, biscuits, pastries, bread, and various New Year cakes. We have newly installed biscuit machines and scientific baking ovens, spending hundreds of millions, with the intention of achieving successful improvements. We are preparing for a year-end food grand competition. We humbly request..." As early as half a month ago, the authorities routinely "prohibited gift-giving" on paper. However, in reality, not only are the display windows of food stores piled high with gifts, but some people are also launching a "grand competition" for manufacturing gifts, ostensibly to promote it. Is this intentional irony? Someone suggested in the newspaper that the police and military should confiscate gifts on the streets and donate them to veterans and civilians. The idea is good, but what about "actions not matching words"?</p>
<p>Lantern Festival Not Held to Celebrate the Completion of Suppressing the Rebellion</p>
<p>The annual Shangyuan Lantern Festival at Tārā Monastery will be temporarily suspended this year. According to reliable information obtained by reporters from relevant parties: the Lantern Festival this year is approaching rapidly. According to religious rituals, the Living Buddhas of the monastery must perform divination before the Buddha to determine the preparations for this year's Lantern Festival. The divination results indicate that this year's Lantern Festival should focus on praying and chanting scriptures, and the butter lamp festival need not be held on a large scale. Based on this instruction, the Living Buddhas also considered that the monastery sent monks out to solicit donations last year, and the amount of alms received was not significant. Furthermore, the country has suffered from the war with the Japanese invaders and the communist bandits for many years, and the national economy is strained. Therefore, in accordance with the state's will to conserve consumption, they unanimously agreed to simplify this year's Shangyuan Festival butter lamp festival at the monastery. Only a small-scale lantern festival will be held in the Grand Sutra Hall on that day, with monks sincerely chanting scriptures to pray for the early success of suppressing the rebellion and the early achievement of peace and unification in the country. The large butter lamp racks that were set up in previous years will be temporarily suspended to comply with the state's will for frugality. The Living Buddha representatives and stewards sent by the monastery recently went to Xining to report everything to the authorities. The Qinghai Provincial Government also believes that the monastery's Lantern Festival has already been determined by the Living Buddhas' divination, which not only does not contradict the religious significance but also greatly supports this act of saving consumption and praying for peace and unification. Therefore, the spokesman for the monastery's Khenpo Office has officially announced to the public: "The annual Shangyuan Lantern Festival is determined by sincere prayer before the Buddha in advance. This year, the divination indicates that a small-scale lantern festival and expanded chanting of scriptures should be the principle. The public has followed the Buddha's will and plans to hold Buddhist events in the Grand Sutra Hall of the monastery from the fourth day of the first lunar month, which means lecturing on scriptures and praying for the success of suppressing the rebellion. According to the religious rules, its significance is even greater than holding a large-scale lantern festival."</p>
<p>To Visit Tārā Monastery, You Must Know Tsongkhapa</p>
<p>Anyone who has been to the Northwest must consider it an honor to visit Tārā Monastery. The annual Shangyuan Festival butter lamp festival is particularly grand and famous. Therefore, every festival season, all believers travel thousands of miles to worship and express their piety. People at home and abroad who admire the magnificent architecture of the monastery and yearn for the exquisite craftsmanship of the butter lamps also travel long distances to witness this grand event.</p>
<p>When was Tārā Monastery completed? How does it have such great magic to attract millions of people? To answer these questions, one must start with the life story of the Great Master Tsongkhapa.</p>
<p>The Great Master Tsongkhapa was born on the 25th day of the tenth month of the 26th year of the Ming Dynasty's Hongwu reign (Guiyou year) at the original site of Tārā Monastery, 29 kilometers southwest of Xining City, Qinghai. At that time, this place was the nomadic residence of the Tsongkhapa family. His father was Lubumge, and his mother was named Xiangsha Ache. After the master was born, the blood from cutting the umbilical cord dripped on the ground, and the next year, a sandalwood tree grew, with images of the lion's roar Buddha on each leaf, totaling ten thousand. (Tibetan name: Kumbum) Therefore, people from far and near thought it was extraordinary, and more and more people came to worship. Because the Tibetan name for the Huangshui River is Zongqu, the master was named Tsongkhapa.</p>
<p>The master was exceptionally intelligent at the age of three and studied with Domarawa Yedoje. At the age of seven, he took Dorje Rinchen as his teacher, became a monk, received novice vows, and deeply studied Buddhism. At the age of seventeen, the master, seeing that the Buddhist monks at that time were gradually becoming heretical, and the precepts were corrupt, and the rules were gone, resolutely resolved to reform. He took the role of Buddhism's Martin Luther as his own and went to Tibet for further study. In Tibet, he personally built Dadeng Temple, reformed and innovated the new religion, and his followers wore yellow robes and yellow hats, so people called it the Yellow Sect. The master promoted Buddhism in Tibet and passed away on the 25th day of the tenth month of the 15th year of the Chenghua reign (Jihai year), at the age of seventy-five.</p>
<p>Grateful for the Master's Grace, Build Tārā Monastery</p>
<p>After the Great Master Tsongkhapa went to Tibet, during the Yongle period of the Ming Dynasty, local people, to commemorate the master, built a pagoda next to the sandalwood tree, with a Buddhist niche above, and enshrined a golden statue of the master inside, as a place for people from far and near to worship. This is the current Great Golden Tile Temple. Later, it gradually expanded, including the Small Golden Tile Temple, large and small scripture halls, and other one hundred and eight temples, as well as countless monks' residences and Buddhist houses, lining the mountain gully, very clean. The Living Buddhas of Qinghai each have their own Gariva. The Qinghai Provincial Government also has guest houses for receiving tourists. The Tenth Panchen Lama also resides in the "Angqian Courtyard" on the hillside.</p>
<p>Butter Lamps Lit Together, Believers All Worship</p>
<p>Every year on the night of the Shangyuan Festival, Tārā Monastery must present butter lamps, sculpting Buddha statues, landscapes, palaces, flowers, birds, and animals out of butter, adding colors to make them lifelike. Sculpting begins after the Mid-Autumn Festival each year, and the method is kept secret. On the evening of the Shangyuan Festival, they are displayed in several places for competition. The lamp sheds are built near the Grand Sutra Hall, reaching more than three zhang (about 10 meters) in height. Both sides are decorated with colorful silk embroidery of various Buddhist stories and patterns, adorned with pendants and tassels, which are extremely splendid. Dozens of glass lanterns hang from the top of the shed. In front of the shed, two wooden frames are set up, erecting triangular arches. Butter sculptures of Buddha statues and objects are embedded on the arches. Below, three rows of small brass lamps are arranged, about two or three hundred lamps. After the bright moon rises, hundreds of oil lamps are lit, emitting a faint yellow flame, illuminating the colored butter sculptures above, like a magnificent three-dimensional landscape painting, vivid and unusual, making the viewers feel like they are in a dream. The believers prostrate themselves and worship.</p>
<p>After midnight, the butter statues and lamps are all removed. The next day, at dawn, there is no trace of the lantern festival left. It is said that the meaning of presenting the lanterns is a reproduction of a dream of the Great Master Tsongkhapa, so there is nothing left after dawn. Some people also say that the master shows the scenery of the Western Paradise to strengthen the piety of the believers. However, according to the explanation of people in the religion, it is to commemorate Shakyamuni Buddha, who fought against the Brahmins for faith in the past, from the first day of the first lunar month to the fifteenth day of the first lunar month, and defeated the Brahmins. Therefore, later disciples presented lanterns once every year on the fifteenth day of the first lunar month to commemorate the final victory. (Our reporter Song Lin)</p>

<h3>Spring Festival in Hangzhou: Divining Fate? Sightseeing?</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Hangzhou, 11th of the Month] Before the Spring Festival, the trains from Shanghai to Hangzhou were packed like sardines. Some people even climbed in through the windows? Some even climbed on the train skin, and even the small train toilets were full of people. Although the railway bureau added special trains for returning home, it still could not disperse such a large population. Pan Ming, the stationmaster of Hangzhou Railway Station, told me that in the few days before the Spring Festival, there were always 40,000 passengers from Shanghai to Hangzhou every day, but only 4,000 from Hangzhou to Shanghai. The ticket inspectors on the train could not even find a place to stand. Third-class passengers ran into first class, and first-class passengers were satisfied even if they found a place to stay in third class. I remember last year's Hangzhou Spring Incense Pilgrimage was unprecedentedly lively, with only 11,000 passengers from Shanghai to Hangzhou. The returning home trains the year before last were only 20,000 passengers per day. This year, it broke all previous records. Why is this? These are difficult years tormenting the wanderers struggling in foreign lands. They are seeking a moment of comfort, a moment of warmth. In today's world, where everywhere is cold and bleak, only returning home, kissing the white hair of their kind mothers, hugging their young children, and kissing the familiar hometown can be considered the only comfort.</p>
<p>A Day of Good Sunshine Shines on West Lake</p>
<p>The Spring Festival has arrived. A rare day of good sunshine shines on West Lake. From 6:00 AM to 9:00 PM, the roads, especially Hubin Road, are crowded with men and women. The bicycles in the bicycle shops are all rented out. Chartered buses carry people to Lingyin or Nanshan. Some trucks temporarily put up a few benches, carrying people for sightseeing around the lake. More than half of the crowd are from the countryside. They wear red and green, new clothes and new socks. They devoutly celebrate this Lunar New Year. Toy vendors sell toys along the street, and the prices are twice as high as usual. The prices of rickshaws and tricycles are also twice as high. The boats in West Lake charge 20,000 yuan per person from Hubin to Zhongshan Park. As long as the buyers say "Get rich, get blessed," the employers are happy to accept without hesitation.</p>
<p>Beishan and Tianzhu Compete to Burn the First Incense</p>
<p>In this year, "getting rich" is still a great joy. Under the turmoil of world affairs, national affairs, family affairs, and personal affairs, hardship and difficulty are pressing on everyone's heart. They can only pray for the blessing of the gods. The lively situation in the three Tianzhu temples in Beishan during the Spring Festival far exceeds last year's spring pilgrimage. Just talking about burning the first incense, there are hundreds of people. Afterwards, the Tianzhu Road is full of traffic, and the incense smoke in the Tianzhu Temple surrounds the roof. People who burn incense silently pray, hoping that the merciful and compassionate Guanyin Bodhisattva will bless them! They seek lottery and hope to get a "superior" one.</p>
<p>In the main hall of Shangtianzhu, Maitreya outside the mountain gate is in a not-so-glorious house. The monks take advantage of people's requests from the Bodhisattva, and they also reach out to the pious men and women. Because they hope the Bodhisattva will bestow more blessings, they are also happy to donate generously.</p>
<p>Jinhua General Temple: Candles Cannot Be Pulled Out</p>
<p>The Jinhua General Temple in Yongjinmen is even more lively. It is so crowded that there is no way to add more people in the temple. Pilgrims are still crowding into the temple. The candles that have just been inserted are pulled out by another person who comes to worship. Another person pulls them out again for the same reason. Seven or eight pairs of large candles are burning brightly. The Taoists came up with a method and temporarily piled incense, candles, paper ingots, etc. on the street into ten stalls, lit them up, and the fire was warm. The people watching and burning incense crowded this large road. It is said that General Jinhua was a great general of the Ming Dynasty who died for defending the city. Later generations respected him as a god, and it is said that he is in charge of wealth. Therefore, those seeking wealth are eager to be the first. It is also said that General Jinhua is extraordinarily intelligent and answers all requests. During the Spring Festival, those who go to ask General Jinhua include men and women from the countryside and fashionable girls from the city, all asking to be blessed with wealth. Chenghuang Mountain is also the most lively, where there are ten palaces of Yama, in charge of everyone's fate. Therefore, everyone has to worship Yama, especially the little devils next to Yama, who need to be carefully served. No matter how sad the world is, there are always more people who are fascinated by this world than those who hate this world. Without the means to change the world, they use gods and mysteries to entrust their own life experiences. Although this has been a product of thousands of years, what method can China, which is constantly in turmoil, use to lead them to a different path? The fortune tellers on Chenghuang Mountain also seized the opportunity, using the slogan of being able to determine your life's fortune and misfortune, and sure enough, those who came to ask for advice flocked to them.</p>
<p>Tourists are also Crowded at Jade Emperor Mountain</p>
<p>Other places such as Wangshan, Liuhe Pagoda, and Hupao Spring are also crowded with tourists, but not as prosperous as Tianzhu, Jinhua General Temple, and Chenghuang Mountain. During this Spring Festival season, there are definitely more people who divine their fate than those who go sightseeing. An old Hangzhou native smiled and told me: "Look, spring has already come. The willow tips are already turning green, the spring plum blossoms are already blooming, and the peach blossoms already have buds. This year's incense pilgrimage will be even more lively than last year due to the inspiration of the Spring Festival homecoming." Yes, look at the temples in the scenic area and the shops by the lake. They are all shaking off their spirits to welcome their happy and good business days.

<h3>Spring Festival Troop Support</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Fengxian, 7th of the Month] The County Chamber of Commerce and the Nanqiao Town Office, because the Spring Festival has arrived, in order to comfort the national troops stationed in the county and the county security, police, and self-defense teams, on the morning of the 7th, Chairman Ma and Mayor Li, representing local gentry, merchants, and all sectors of society, presented gifts such as pork, Shaoxing wine, cigarettes, and Jiaobai in separate gifts, and personally sent them to the respective units to reward and comfort them.</p>

<h3>Sun Jiaxiang Shot and Killed His Wife, Sentenced to Ten Years</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Chongqing, 9th of the Month] Sun Jiaxiang, former Major General of the Inspection Team of the Qianzhou Security Department, was sentenced to ten years in prison by the Executive Headquarters for the case of living with the famous Zhu opera singer Mao Yanfang and shooting and killing his legal wife Peng Junzhu.</p>
<h3>Famous Guangzhou Flowers Without Owners, Prices are Doubled</h3>
<p>[Air Dispatch from Guangzhou, 7th of the Month] The situation in Guangzhou is deteriorating rapidly. According to a business leader: "Out of the 24,430 stores in Guangzhou, about 5,000 are closing down or selling due to their inability to survive the New Year, accounting for one-fifth of the total." The tragic situation can be imagined.</p>
<p>The first graduates of the Guangzhou dance girl retraining class have no jobs to switch to. Since it happens to be the festive season, the dance halls "urgently need talent," so they have "switched" back to the fiery scene to be active. In recent days, Shanghai and Hong Kong dance girls have come to Guangzhou one after another, and the dance hall scene here is booming. With the Spring Festival approaching, all industries are depressed, but street flowers alone have doubled in price. Each large peach blossom branch is priced at 18 million yuan, each peony pot at 3 million yuan, and narcissus at 200,000 yuan. Flower sellers fill the streets, and flower buyers also fill the streets. Famous flowers and dance girls each have their own value. The authorities are determined to crack down on smugglers on the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway, especially with the New Year approaching and smuggling being the most rampant. A large number of military police have been dispatched to increase the number of personnel stationed in Shiling Shenzhen, the channel for smugglers to enter and exit. More than a thousand smugglers have been arrested in recent days and will be sent to Hainan Island and the Northeast to "develop the border." Also, because smugglers take the train and often climb on top of the cars without buying tickets, in order to eliminate these people, it has been decided to install water dragons on the water towers at major stations along the route. When the trains arrive at the station, if people are found on the roof, they will be sprayed with water. It has also been decided to "try the new method" on the Lunar New Year. Many of these smugglers are unemployed soldiers who take risks to make a living. There have been repeated reports of suicides due to the loss of their capital and the inability to make a living.

<h3>Hull's Memoirs (18)</h3>
<p>— Copyright by North American Newspaper Alliance. Translated by this newspaper's translation department.</p>
<p>This: Talking Peace Now is Suicide</p>
<p>At 10:50 p.m. in 1940, the telephone in my apartment rang. It was Ambassador Cudahy in Brussels, telling me in an agitated voice that a large number of German aircraft were crossing Luxembourg and flying towards Belgium, and that they also seemed to be appearing over the Netherlands. Cudahy also told me that a large number of German troops were massing on the borders of Belgium, Luxembourg, and the Netherlands, and that the Belgian side expected the German army to attack around dawn.</p>
<p>I called the President and told him the news Cudahy had given me, and then called several colleagues in the State Department. I arrived at the office a little after eleven o'clock, a little earlier than everyone else. I immediately called several important capitals in Europe. When I got through to Cudahy, he told me that Luxembourg had been invaded, that German planes were bombing the airfield near Bruxelles, and that German forces seemed ready to attack Belgium, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg simultaneously.</p>
<p>But more dangerous than the successful German attack on Belgium, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg was the telegram that Ambassador Bullitt sent to the President and me on May 15th, which said that the German army, led by a large number of tank units and dive bombers, had already broken through the French lines at Sedan. Prime Minister Reynaud called Churchill and said that once the German army had broken through, the war would be beyond salvation in a few days. According to Reynaud, unless Britain immediately sent its fighter squadrons from the United Kingdom to France, the war was over. Churchill promised to raise this prescient matter within the war cabinet, but resolutely said over the phone that the war was not beyond salvation. Reynaud replied that Churchill should know that when Reynaud was Prime Minister, France was determined to fight to the end.</p>
<p>On the same day, May 15th, Ambassador Kennedy sent a telegram to the President and me, telling us about a sensational conversation he had just had with Churchill. The Prime Minister said that if Italy entered the war, he thought the chances of the Allies winning were slim. Churchill said that France was asking for more troops to be sent, but he was unwilling to send people out of Britain at this time, because he firmly believed that Britain would soon be subject to fierce attack within a month. Churchill also said he wanted us to lend him thirty or forty old destroyers, as well as any planes we could spare.</p>
<p>The President and I had no doubt that the victory of the Allied powers was necessary for the security of the United States. The President quickly reviewed this issue and immediately decided to collect every available warplane and transport it to France. On May 14th, Bullitt telegraphed me, suggesting that France send an aircraft carrier to transport them. After consulting with the President, I replied the next day that due to the provisions of international law and the status of the United States, it was impossible to load these planes in New York, but they could be flown to a port on the east coast of Canada first, possibly Halifax, and then loaded there. This was done—but it was too late to transport them to France.</p>
<p>The President knew and fully understood that the advantage shown by the German army in occupying the Netherlands and breaking through Sedan in a blitzkrieg required us to fully estimate the task of revitalizing American armaments. The President and I discussed a plan to submit a special message to Congress, requesting that military appropriations for that year be effectively doubled, a point I fully agreed with. On May 13th, Bullitt sent a telegram to me, asking it to be forwarded to the President, which strongly argued that, due to the important role played by aircraft in the German advance, it was necessary to increase aircraft production. So I suggested to the President that the United States should aim to produce 50,000 aircraft per year. Before that, I had mentioned this number to my colleagues. Mr. Stettinius's reaction was the same as my colleagues'—he was speechless, because 50,000 aircraft was ten times the current annual production. But I argued that it would be most appropriate to set a larger number and a far-reaching goal. Such a production volume did not seem as impossible to me as it did to others. I felt that simply raising this number, coupled with our country's vast production capacity known throughout the world, would have a good effect in inspiring our own people, comforting the Allies, and making the Axis powers wary.</p>
<p>The President then expressed his agreement. On May 16th, in a message to Congress, he said he hoped the country would step up production to produce 50,000 aircraft per year. He requested additional appropriations for the various departments of the armed forces, totaling $1.182 billion. Subsequently, Prime Minister Reynaud began to send the President a series of extraordinary, almost hysterical appeals. The French Prime Minister was obviously shocked and agitated by the German army's astonishing victory, which is quite understandable. But what he was asking for was impossible. On May 18th, the Secretary-General of the French Foreign Ministry, Léger, notified Ambassador Bullitt that Reynaud intended to make a personal appeal to the President that night, asking whether Mr. Roosevelt could obtain a declaration of war against Germany from Congress. Bullitt telegraphed the President and me, saying that he had replied to Léger that such an appeal would not only be useless, but would have even worse consequences. The President would not ask Congress to declare war against Germany, and Congress would almost certainly oppose a declaration of war. Bullitt frankly pointed out that if Reynaud had to make such an appeal, it would only be a matter of record, so that one day Reynaud could show that he had appealed to the President of the United States, and the President had refused. Bullitt said to Léger that this approach, in his view, was not only unworthy of Britain, France, and even the United States, but that the current situation was too serious for the three governments to engage in anything other than frank dealings.</p>
<p>The President and I agreed that Bullitt's reply to Léger reflected our views.</p>
<p>That night, Bullitt went to see Reynaud in person, who said he wanted to send us a formal note.</p>
<p>Bullitt told us his opinion that Reynaud had not come up with a solution to the matter and had decided to send a fake note as a record. This decision had been prevented by Bullitt's conversation with Léger that afternoon. After the President and I discussed Reynaud and Bullitt's conversation, the President called Bullitt and told him that things of this nature were out of the question. Bullitt immediately conveyed this to Reynaud.</p>
<p>On May 22nd, Bullitt telegraphed the President and me again, saying that Reynaud told him that he would not let the matter drop. This was now of greater importance than it had been four days earlier when he had last discussed the matter. France had received news from Italy and Sweden that if Germany won another major victory in the current battle in northern France, Hitler intended to offer France a separate and generous peace.</p>
<p>Reynaud said that if Hitler made such a suggestion at a time of extreme despair in France, there was a great danger that the French public would tend to accept it. Reynaud himself admitted that such acceptance was tantamount to suicide, just as Czechoslovakia had given up the Sudetenland in 1938. From then on, France would live under the German iron heel, and as soon as Hitler deemed it convenient, he would occupy all of France just as he had occupied all of Czechoslovakia. Furthermore, Germany's victory over Britain would follow in a few weeks. Then Reynaud believed that within a few months German soldiers and thousands of planes would arrive in South America, the Panama Canal would be bombed, and American troops would not be able to put up much resistance.</p>
<p>He believed that no American aid other than a declaration of war would be sufficient to save France and Britain. If we could not give military aid beyond the limits of a declaration of war, we would have to deal with the Germans in America. The military situation in France was rapidly deteriorating. In the face of the obvious and understandable situation in France, I held many meetings in my office with my colleagues, asking them to consider the various possibilities of the development of the European war, paying particular attention to their impact on the United States and the Western Hemisphere. We reached a general conclusion that the position of the Allied forces was already extremely difficult, and that our attention should be focused on preserving the British and French fleets so that they would not fall into Hitler's hands.</p>
<p>The President agreed to make a direct appeal to the British and French governments on the naval issue. We immediately drafted a telegram, which was sent on May 26th. In a telegram to Bullitt, I said that the President wanted him to explain to Reynaud and Daladier that while we still hoped that the German invasion could be prevented, if the situation deteriorated, we believed that the preservation of the French fleet was important for the restoration of France and its colonies, for the control of the seas, and for France to obtain more lenient peace terms. We expressed the same view on the issue of the British fleet in our communication to the British government. On May 20th, Churchill telegraphed the President, emphasizing the danger faced by Britain, and saying that if the United Kingdom were conquered by Hitler, the only thing with which to negotiate a treaty with Germany would be the fleet. The President also mentioned this point in his telegram to Churchill. He suggested to Churchill that if the situation deteriorated, the British fleet could retreat to Canada, and guaranteed that the United States would never allow Germany or any other non-American country to seize Canada or other British possessions in the Western Hemisphere. As long as the British and French fleets could be kept intact, Germany could not win the war except within Europe.</p>
<p>Reynaud's appeals were now becoming more intense. Bullitt telegraphed us on May 28th, stating that Reynaud proposed that the President of the French Republic and the King of England issue a joint appeal to the President. When Bullitt saw Reynaud, he had already written a sentence, saying: "The army fighting for the world is being stabbed in the back."</p>
<p>Reynaud said that he knew that even if we declared war on Germany tomorrow, we would not be able to airlift troops to France, because such aircraft did not exist. But we had a fleet. The Atlantic Fleet should be sent to the Mediterranean immediately. This action could at least prevent another stabbing in the back, this time from Mussolini.</p>
<p>After completing its Dunkirk evacuation, Britain indicated to France that it could no longer send aircraft to the continent. The British Ambassador to France told Bullitt that the destruction rate of aircraft in combat was so high that if Britain sent its remaining aircraft over, there would be nothing left in two weeks. Since there no longer seemed to be any hope of saving France or even the French army, it seemed better to keep the aircraft in Britain in preparation for the impending Battle of Britain. In response to Reynaud's almost pitiful appeal, the President urged Churchill to send aircraft to France, but the Prime Minister refused. Bullitt was outraged by this decision, and reported to the President and me on June 5th that Britain might be preserving its air force and navy as bargaining chips in negotiations with Hitler.</p>
<p>But the President and I did not think so. We knew that France was finished, but we believed that Britain, under Churchill's indomitable leadership, wanted to continue fighting.</p>
<p>The idea of ​​peace terms with Germany now occupied the attention of the French cabinet. Telegrams from Bullitt increasingly reflected that France's surrender was only a matter of days away. The German army was advancing rapidly towards Paris. On June 10th, the French government moved to Tours.</p>
<p>On that day, Mussolini declared war on France and Britain.</p>

<h3>Five Million School-Age Children Need One Million Elementary School Classes: Ministry of Education Establishes Policy Principles to Improve National Normal School Education</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Dahua News Agency, Nanjing] Since the implementation of national education, the most challenging issue has been the lack of teachers. It is estimated that there are approximately 50 million school-age children nationwide. Assuming 50 students per class, at least one million elementary school classes are needed to accommodate everyone. If each class requires 1.5 teachers, at least 1.5 million teachers are needed (or 2 million if folk education classes are also run, with 2 teachers per class). According to statistics from the Ministry of Education, there are currently 650,000 national teachers nationwide. Regardless of whether current teachers are qualified, at least one million additional teachers are needed to popularize national education. Furthermore, according to Ministry of Education statistics, it would take over 3,000 years for existing normal schools to train one million teachers. Actively developing normal education and improving its facilities to meet practical needs is currently the most important task. To this end, the Ministry of Education has formulated the following policy principles:</p>
<p>50,000 Normal School Graduates Annually</p>
<p>(1) Central and provincial/municipal governments should pay special attention to the development of normal education when developing secondary education. Until normal education has developed to a substantial level, the development of ordinary middle schools can be temporarily restricted. The scale of normal school development should ensure a ratio of at least one normal school student for every one hundred school-age children. If there are 50 million school-age children nationwide, there should be at least 500,000 normal school students. If 50,000 graduate annually, accounting for 10% of the total number of teachers needed, it may barely meet the needs of newly established schools and fill vacancies due to retirement and death. In this way, the quality of national teachers can be generally improved after ten years. (2) The development of normal education should prioritize establishing more normal schools and women's normal schools. Currently, simplified normal schools can still be widely established, with at least one in each county. In the future, efforts should be made to gradually convert them into normal schools or women's normal schools within three years. The duration of study in simplified normal schools cannot be less than four years, and the minimum admission age is fifteen.</p>
<p>Teachers and Students Jointly Operate National Education Demonstration Zones</p>
<p>(3) The curriculum of normal schools and simplified normal schools should be revised in consideration of actual needs. Teaching in all subjects in normal schools should focus on the research of teaching materials and methods, as well as guidance in practical exercises. Special attention should be paid to internships. Each normal school should also designate an area as a national education internship or demonstration zone, operated jointly by teachers and students, to increase students' practical experience in national education. (4) The treatment of normal school students in school must be improved. In addition to ensuring that food meets their nutritional needs, books, supplies, uniforms, and other necessary expenses must also be provided. (5) Following the example of France before the war, normal school graduates should serve in education for at least ten years and should not be allowed to delay service for any reason. During their service, they should receive higher salaries in national education. After serving for a certain period, those who aspire to educational administrative work may also be selected and appointed.</p>
<p>Vacation Travel Allowed After Five Years of Service</p>
<p>(6) Normal school graduates who have completed their service period and have excellent service records and aspire to further education may be recommended to normal colleges for further study in national education, tuition-free and without examination, after completing five years of service. After graduation, they must still engage in national education administration or national education undertakings, but they must receive higher salaries compared to educational administrators and secondary school teachers. Those who do not pursue further education will be granted a one-year sabbatical after five years of service to conduct research and study outside the province or abroad. During the sabbatical, they will continue to receive their original salary and receive a travel allowance. After the sabbatical, they will return to their original positions and continue to serve, with a sabbatical of one year every five years.</p>

<h3>End of Tongji University Student Unrest: Ministry of Education Cables Thanks to Senators, Orders Expulsion of One Hundred Students; Transferring to Other Schools Encounters Difficulties</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] Twenty-four institutions and organizations, including the Shanghai Municipal Senate, previously sent telegrams to the Chairman of the National Government, the Premier of the Executive Yuan, and the Minister of Education regarding the Tongji University student unrest and the case of Mayor Wu being insulted, requesting that the school's atmosphere be rectified and the perpetrators severely punished. It is now learned that Minister of Education Zhu Jiahua replied a few days ago, saying: "Your telegram has been respectfully received. Your concern for education is deeply appreciated! This time, Tongji University students, disregarding the student union rules promulgated by the Ministry, arbitrarily established an illegal department representative assembly. Initially, they insulted teachers, and then threatened to strike. Principal Ding of the school had no choice but to expel the ringleaders in order to rectify school discipline. However, these students became even more arrogant and intensified their actions, attempting to collectively petition in Nanjing. Mayor Wu personally went to dissuade them, but was instead beaten and insulted. Such blatant disregard for the law is extremely distressing! After receiving the report, the Ministry immediately dispatched Vice Minister Hang Liewu to Shanghai to personally express condolences to Mayor Wu, and to carry a dissolution order. The original intention was to dissolve the assembly immediately, but after consulting with Mayor Wu, although Mayor Wu initially agreed, he later stated that there were practical difficulties in its implementation, and strongly advocated for continued guidance. Therefore, the school's prepared announcement had to be halted from being posted, and the Ministry's order could not be carried out. The Ministry could only respect the opinions of the local authorities. Therefore, the school was ordered to thoroughly reorganize, investigate the students who caused trouble, and severely punish them accordingly. Those whose circumstances were serious were to be expelled from school, and those who violated criminal law were to be handed over to the court for separate handling. It was also found that students from other schools participated in the incident, which was obviously a consistent conspiracy by traitors and bandits to instigate strikes and market closures in order to expand the incident, deliberately disrupting the measures to maintain social order during the suppression of rebellion, and ultimately opposing the government. Their ulterior motives are clear and not comparable to ordinary student unrest. The Ministry immediately issued a notice to all colleges and universities that evening, instructing them to pay attention to the facts of the incident, investigate and strictly restrain them to prevent any disturbance, and ordered Shanghai colleges and universities to thoroughly investigate and severely punish the perpetrators. Your council and others have upheld justice and are enthusiastic about education. Thank you again for your cooperation and please continue to support and provide guidance."</p>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] One hundred students who were ordered to withdraw from Tongji University a few days ago have not yet completely left the school. It is reported that many of these one hundred students are from bandit areas, and there is currently no suitable place for them to go. The certificates of study issued to each student by the school indicate that the main foreign language studied at the school is German, while other universities in the country study English textbooks, making it extremely difficult to transfer. They plan to orally request the Ministry of Education to provide relief.</p>

<h3>5-1: Hong Kong Team Wins Big: Inter-Port Football Match, Shanghai Team Suffers Crushing Defeat, Huang Mao Guan Ao and Yan Shixin Underperform, Disorganized Formation, Zhang Chenbang Best</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Hong Kong, 10th] In today's Shanghai-Hong Kong inter-port football match, the Hong Kong team defeated the Shanghai team by a score of 5-1. The Hong Kong team won 2-1 in the first half, and scored three more goals in the second half. The Shanghai team's lack of coordination and the Hong Kong team's tight defense were the main reasons for the Shanghai team's defeat. Zhang Banglun was the best player on the team. Huang Mao Roberts was tightly marked by the Hong Kong team and could not perform to his best. Sun Jinshun injured his leg and was less active in the second half. Zou Wenzhi was the most active for the Hong Kong team. The Shanghai team's only goal was scored by Fei Chunhua.</p>
<p>[Guoguang Agency, Hong Kong, 10th] The Shanghai representative team arrived in Hong Kong in four batches by ship and plane. The game was held here today, and the atmosphere at the stadium was very lively. As a result, the Shanghai team was defeated 1-5. The Hong Kong team led 2-1 in the first half.</p>
<p>The Hong Kong team had eight local players and three foreign players, while the Shanghai team had nine native-born warriors and two foreign generals. Zou Wenzhi scored the first goal for the Hong Kong team. Deng Yijie also scored. Ten minutes before the end of the first half, Fei Chunhua scored a goal for the Shanghai team, making it 2-1, Hong Kong leading. After switching sides, the Shanghai team launched a full-scale counterattack, but the Hong Kong team's defense was tight and they could not penetrate. Eight minutes later, Kini, the left forward for the Hong Kong team, scored another goal. Shortly after, Wu Qixiang caused trouble in the penalty area, and Zhu Yongqiang scored a penalty. Five minutes before the end of the game, Zou Wenzhi scored another goal, leading the Hong Kong team to a 5-1 victory and winning back the Inter-Port Silver Cup.</p>
<p>In this game, the Hong Kong team controlled the overall situation, with good coordination and quick advances and retreats. The Shanghai team's performance was disappointing, with slow movements and a disorganized formation. Zhang Banglun saved a penalty due to Yan Shixin's poor performance and Wu Qixiang's carelessness. The best performers were only Gao Baozheng, Hanni Bo, and Fei Chunhua.</p>
<h3>Adjusting the Formation, Defeating the Hualian Team</h3>
<p>[Guoguang Agency, Hong Kong, 11th] The Shanghai Inter-Port Football Team played its second game in Hong Kong today, playing against the Hong Kong United Team in the afternoon. Because the Shanghai team's performance in yesterday's game was not ideal, the atmosphere at the stadium was not as lively as on the first day. Moreover, most fans had high expectations for the Hong Kong team to win before the game, but the reality was the opposite. The Shanghai team made major adjustments to its formation. Meng Yiliang played as center back, and partnered well with Gao Baozheng and Jing Nibo. Yan Shixin was replaced by Guan Ao, Li Yichen played as right back, and Qixiang moved to the left. Banglun saved a penalty, and the defense was solid. On the forward line, Sun Lao Jin was replaced, and Xia Tixian and Li Yao had good coordination. Fei Chunhua was lively and exquisite, and performed well. After the Hong Kong team replaced two players, their formation became disorganized. Fei Chunhua scored not long after the start of the game, giving the Shanghai team a 1-0 lead in the first half. In the second half, Fei Chunhua received a pass from Li Yao and headed the ball into the goal, leading 2-0. Shortly after, Baozheng committed a handball in the penalty area. Li Shuoyou took the penalty, but Banglun saved it. After another ten minutes, Feng Jingxiang lived up to expectations and scored a goal. After that, the two sides fell into a stalemate. In the end, the Shanghai team defeated the Hong Kong Hualian team 2-1. The Shanghai team will play against the Hong Kong West United Team on the 13th.</p>

According to sources from the Gold Control Bureau: The price of gold ornaments is determined by the central government, based on the national bank's gold price (40 US dollars per tael), plus 40% for operating expenses and 20% for legitimate profit. Currently, the total value is 8.6 million yuan in legal tender per tael. The Gold Control Bureau is discussing the labor cost item with the Social Affairs Bureau, which is approximately an additional 20% of the total amount, for a total of approximately 10 million yuan per tael. According to the person in charge of the Gold Control: After jewelers resume selling gold ornaments, management of the jewelry industry will be strengthened. All relevant account books must be submitted to the Social Affairs Bureau for verification in advance, and the daily inventory and sales volume must be reported to the Gold Control Bureau for record. It is hoped that the black market for gold can be eliminated in one fell swoop. Under a strict management policy, the price of gold can be reasonably stabilized.</p>
<h3>Excess Silver Supply After New Year: Shanghai Stocks Turn from Weak to Stable</h3>
<p>The rumor that the silver loan might be delayed until mid-June to resolve has caused people's hearts to rebound from fatigue to stability. Small-cap stocks have been distracted by the resumption of the jewelry industry and are very mediocre. With an oversupply of silver, white yarn transactions exceeded red yarn transactions, and the premium gradually dropped to 1.5 jiao. The morning opened slightly stable, and Yong Yarn was listed at 705 yuan and 735 yuan. Numbers 185, 137, 183, 160, 71, 186, and 89 were delivered immediately upon entry. Numbers 97, 2322, 188, 71, 134, and 169 were submitted in succession, rising to 725 yuan and 756 yuan. The off-market interest rate was still 3 jiao 1.5 fen and 3 jiao 6 fen. Numbers 96, 103, 24, and 155 were sold at high prices, dropping to around 720 yuan and 750 yuan. The swap premium gradually decreased, and large investors and brokers were active in immediate delivery. Numbers 157, 16, 69, 65, 35, 36, 176, and 130 were bought one after another, rising to a high price of 736 yuan for immediate delivery and 765 yuan for forward delivery. Numbers 180, 185, 103, and 197 all exited immediate delivery, and Number 22 also offered forward delivery. The afternoon closing dropped to 728 yuan and 756 yuan. Small stocks remained quiet as before, and the arbitrage price retreated to 25 yuan, with only 1.5 jiao of interest. As a result, compared to the last closing price at the end of the Lunar New Year, immediate delivery stocks Qinxing, Xinhua, Commerce, and Shangping, Zhongsi and Zhongfang slightly decreased, and Xinhuo, Huaguang, Xinguang, Jingfu, Zhongqie, Neiyi, Match, and Rongde slightly increased. Yong Yarn, Maya, Guohuo, Huian, Xinyi, and Zhabei Tongyi each rose by half a percent for forward delivery stocks. Yong Yarn rose by half a percent for forward delivery stocks, and Xinguang also rose by slightly less than half a percent. All others rose slightly. Except for public utilities stocks, which rose slightly, all off-market unlisted stocks were flat or weak.</p>
<h3>Arbitrage Trading</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the silver supply was greatly excessive, with less demand, and the arbitrage price gradually decreased, with the premium dropping from 2 jiao 2 fen to 1 jiao 3 fen. A portion of the arbitrage positions were forced to move off-market, and brokers also bought white yarn on-market to move off-market. Calculating the premium, Yongmiao was the cheapest, opening at 35 yuan and closing at 25 yuan. Xinguang became more expensive, at 5 yuan to 5.5 yuan. Maya had few transactions, with a high price of 5.5 yuan. The opening and closing prices were both 5.0 yuan. Xinhuo opened at 1.6 yuan. Shanghai stocks were traded for half a day yesterday, the second day of the Spring Festival. Public utilities are about to adjust prices, and Western newspapers also mentioned a US loan of yuan, retreating from 1.65 yuan to 1.4 yuan at closing.</p>
<h3>Post-Holiday Stock Market Notes</h3>
<p>The stock market opened after the Spring Festival with initial strength followed by fatigue. The foreign exchange adjustment on the 9th caused external stimulus and opened high due to excess capital. Eternal Cotton Yarn reached 700 yuan for immediate delivery and rose to 717 yuan for future delivery. Innerwear China Mud even reached the limit up, with off-market trading opening more than 30 yuan higher. After opening, numbers 97, 36, and 74 advanced to high prices of 714 yuan and 7122 yuan, but soon numbers 191, 151, 154, 76, 207, 90, 76, 31, 71, 65, 152, and 157 collectively supplied, resulting in limited trading and intermittent activity amid firecracker sounds. The price gradually decreased to lows of 697 yuan and 698 yuan before closing at 700 yuan and 702 yuan. Other stocks also declined. Off-market trading bids were close, with only a difference of about ten yuan. As a result, compared to the end of the lunar year, immediate delivery of China Mud had less trading but reached the limit up, and innerwear rose slightly after reaching the limit up. Eternal Cotton Yarn, Mayer, Lih An, National Goods, Rong Meng, Tong Yi, Match, and Yong Gong rose slightly. Xin He, Jing Fu, French, Xin Hua, and Zha Bei declined slightly. Hua Meng, Xin Guang, Xin Yi, Commerce, and China Silk remained unchanged. Future delivery stocks Qin Xing fell by half a percent, and the rest declined slightly. Off-market trading of unlisted stocks showed no activity for number 19, indicating a flat trend.</p>
<h3>Government Bonds and Foreign Stocks</h3>
<p>Still on holiday, with no gatherings yet.</p>
<p>Trading yesterday was extremely low. Except for a few popular stocks, miscellaneous stocks were inactive. People's minds were stimulated by external factors. Jardine Matheson opened high at 620,000 yuan and rose to close at 650,000 yuan, showing a much better performance than A stocks. As a result, compared to before the holiday closure, Jardine Matheson rose by half, British American Tobacco rose by 10%, and Jardine Brewery, Paper Edition Industry, and Guangzhou Shipyard each rose by half a percent. Hode Malleable Industries only rose slightly.</p>
<h3>Business Houses on Holiday, Capital Fund Greatly Eased</h3>
<p>[Our Reporter] Before and after the Lunar New Year, capital in the city first tightened and then eased. Before New Year's Eve, the National Bank issued a large amount of Customs Gold Units and cash, amounting to about two trillion, to facilitate market turnover. Yesterday, money shops still operated as usual, while most commercial firms took a holiday as usual. The amount of bill exchange decreased sharply, only about one-tenth of the usual volume, and the entire financial industry entered a state of standstill. Capital remained loose yesterday, with some cash flowing back to the National Bank. On the 11th, the National Bank had a net inflow of 8.5 billion, and the National Bank Bureaus had a net inflow of 33.7 billion. On the 12th, the National Bank had a net inflow of 66.9 billion, and the National Bank Bureaus had a net inflow of 65.7 billion.

The office is preparing a report, which approved more than 100 cases, with a total acquisition amount of more than 140 billion. Most of the funds have been released by various bank bureaus. The acquisition procedures were completed on the 9th. This acquisition had a relief nature because some materials were not needed by the government and were not easy to sell at auction. The General Office of the Four Banks will have separate regulations for the auction method, which will be handled by the China Trust Bureau. The timing of the auction has not yet been determined.</p>
<h3>Sales of Political and Legal Materials, A New Organization Will Be Established</h3>
<p>Regarding the sale of government materials, according to relevant sources, sales will no longer be entrusted to agents, whether they are industrial and morning finished products or government properties. An organization will be formed in the short term to uniformly handle the sale of materials. The selection of personnel and the establishment date have not yet been determined.</p>
<h3>US Dollar Exchange Rate Rises During Holiday, Off-Market Cotton Yarn Market Strengthens</h3>
<p>The cotton yarn market officially closed on the 9th, but some trading took place off-market. The initial market was stable, but after hearing that the US dollar exchange rate had risen by another 4,000, sentiment suddenly turned strong. 42-count Blue Bell fine yarn rose to 61.5 million yuan, an increase of one million yuan compared to the 8th. 32-count Blue Phoenix and Silver Moon brands also rose by more than 2 million. Trading of 20-count coarse yarn was scarce. 16-count Guang Ming was quoted at 36 million yuan, an increase of 1.5 million yuan.</p>

<p>The Committee for Handling Unlicensed Foreign Exchange Goods Arriving in Port held its 23rd meeting at the China Trust Bureau at 3:00 PM on the 12th to discuss the handling of galvanized lead wire (numbers 12 to 16). For the above-mentioned goods, the review committee recently received a clear order from the Executive Yuan that they must be acquired by the China Trust Bureau and are not allowed to be exported. At the time of acquisition, special foreign currency deposit certificates will be paid in accordance with regulations as the acquisition price, plus 10% of the cost and profit.

<h3>North China Material Export Problem, Export Promotion Office Plans to Find a Thorough Solution</h3>
<p>Shen Zhong, Director of the Business Bureau of the Central Bank, and Chen Junren, Director of the Export Promotion Office of the Import Control Committee, were recently ordered to go to Beijing and Tianjin to resolve the difficulties of industry and commerce in North China. They returned to Shanghai after completing their work on the 8th. According to Mr. Chen Junren, who told reporters: This time, Director Shen and I went to North China to solve the problem of how industry and commerce in Beijing and Tianjin can survive the New Year. The acquisition of finished products by manufacturers is handled according to the methods approved by the General Office of the Four Banks and has a relief nature. However, the situation of export materials is different. Simply acquiring them cannot solve the export problem. The export industry in Tianjin has foresight and specially convened a meeting to suggest four points to the government: to find a thorough solution, (1) extend the settlement time, (2) handle export material mortgages, and export materials can be used as collateral for loans, (3) handle export material financing, including financing from the place of production to the export port, and export packing loans, (4) extend the time for consignment export materials. The above four points are their important suggestions. In fact, the committee has a comprehensive plan for this, and some of it has been implemented separately. Recently, it was not held due to the suspension of loans. There is no problem with the first three items, and the fourth item needs to be considered. In Beijing, most of the exportable materials are industrial products, such as embroidery and lacquerware, which were once popular abroad. Now, other methods will be set up and are planned to be handled in three aspects: (1) credit, (2) mortgage, (3) acquisition. It has been decided to lend 300 million yuan first to survive the New Year. In the future, a way out should be found first, the foreign market should be determined, and then a cooperative should be organized to include these scattered handicrafts into the cooperative as the object of handling, which will be promoted separately within six months.</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 11th] The Import and Export Management Committee announced the handling measures for goods arriving in port with unlicensed self-provided foreign exchange through the Central Trust Bureau, including wool, cotton, and other items. Among them, the 60-day deadline for wool, from the date the Central Trust Bureau announced the wool handling measures, expired on February 9. According to law, if importers are unwilling to apply for government acquisition, they must re-export the goods.

(5) Each of the above sections will be submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval and registered for public announcement in order to inform merchants in advance. If they fail to apply for acquisition after the deadline, the government will strictly deal with them in accordance with regulations.

<h3>Talking About Colds and Coughs</h3>
<p>— Hu Jiayan</p>
<p>This winter seems to be much colder than in previous years, so there are many people with colds and coughs, which really causes a lot of trouble. In fact, colds and coughs are a common disease that everyone knows, and in the decades of life, almost no one can avoid it. It can mostly heal itself, as long as you take care of yourself, and there is no need to see a doctor or take medicine. This common sense is also understood by the general public. Its occurrence is mostly at times when the climate suddenly changes to cold, so it is easiest to spread from hot to autumn cool, and from warm to severe cold; especially in the climate of the last month, which has dropped to below freezing several times, so there are especially many people with it. Regarding the true nature of this disease, how to avoid its occurrence, and how to prevent it from becoming a major problem if it does occur, I would like to reveal it in this publication, and I think it will be of some benefit to the general public, whether they are already suffering from it or not!</p>
<p>What is a cold and cough? This is a well-known term to everyone in the vernacular, not a specialized medical term. Cough can be considered a symptom, but the term "cold" is not even close. Originally, medical terms are based on the cause of their occurrence or the pathological changes in any part of the body; according to this point, the so-called cold and cough, in medicine, such as (1) acute rhinitis (nasal cold), (2) acute laryngitis, (3) acute bronchitis, are all possible. Although these three are individually a symptom, their relationship is interactive, because laryngitis and bronchitis are mostly caused by the spread of rhinitis. Regarding their general situation, I will now describe them one by one below.</p>
<p>The onset of rhinitis is mostly in the pharynx, initially feeling hot and dry, with slight difficulty swallowing, and gradually entering the nasal cavity from the pharynx, down to the larynx and trachea. When it invades the nasal cavity, there are frequent sneezes, the mucous membrane is red and swollen, the nasal passages are narrowed, and even some are blocked, causing obstacles to breathing and pronunciation; the secretion of the mucous membrane is abundant, with runny nose, initially as thin as water, and then thick and yellow, becoming mucous purulent; the sense of smell and taste are impaired, and occasionally there is a headache and a slight increase in temperature. — This phenomenon generally subsides within a few days, except for cases of complications such as paranasal sinusitis, otitis media, and bronchitis.</p>
<p>Those suffering from laryngitis will have an itchy and stinging sensation in the neck and throat, coughing and hoarseness, and finally almost becoming mute, mostly dry cough without phlegm, occasionally with mucous. The mucous membrane is swollen and red, but it can only be detected with a laryngoscope. The larynx of children is narrower than that of adults, so it often presents a severe state, waking up in shock at night, having difficulty breathing, with wheezing, a loud cough, and a pale face, which is called pseudo-diphtheria; but if warm steam is inhaled, the symptoms will quickly alleviate, and they will snore and sleep soundly, as quiet as ever. — This disease usually subsides in about three or four days to one or two weeks, and as the cough decreases, the other symptoms also gradually subside.</p>
<p>The occurrence of bronchitis mostly starts in the pharynx and nasal cold, gradually spreading from the pharynx to the trachea, and down to the left and right bronchial tubes, so it is not limited to the bronchial tubes; in severe cases, it invades the small bronchioles and capillary bronchioles, which is called capillary bronchitis. Among the symptoms, cough is the main one. At the beginning, it is a stubborn dry cough, with slight pain when coughing, and gradually getting transparent, colorless mucous sputum. After two or three days, the cough feels easier, and the sputum is gradually easier to cough up, and the sputum is yellow and purulent; the body temperature generally does not change much, or there may be a slight fever at the beginning, and then it subsides. If the inflammation invades the capillary bronchioles, there will be difficulty breathing and an accelerated pulse, especially in children, and it is not without danger. — The prognosis of this disease is still good, and it generally subsides in one to two weeks; however, children are prone to developing bronchopneumonia, and the elderly are prone to heart failure, falling into critical condition, which is an exception.</p>
<p>The causes of the above diseases are mostly after a cold. In addition, the inhalation of dirty dust and irritating gases, and mechanical and chemical stimulation, are all easy to cause. It is contagious, and often when one person suffers from it, family members and companions develop it one after another; the pathogen has not been determined, but mostly Staphylococcus, Streptococcus, Pneumococcus, and influenza bacilli are all part of a mixed infection. Those with hypertrophy of the nasal turbinates and tonsils are also predisposing factors for this disease. Acute infectious diseases such as measles, pertussis, and influenza can all be complicated by this disease, which is called secondary. Tuberculosis patients with this disease make the condition worse, and it is especially important to prevent it.</p>
<p>Regarding the treatment of this disease, because it can mostly heal itself, there is not much help from medications, so attention to prevention is more important than treatment; such as quitting smoking and drinking, avoiding talking too much, avoiding spicy foods, and avoiding the inhalation of dirty air and harmful gases. In addition, in the personal and family life of the general public, there are several habits that I think need to be corrected; I will now describe them separately below to conclude this article.</p>
<p>(1) Minimize mouth breathing. Usually, breathing through the nose can moisten dry air and warm cold air, and the bacteria and dust in the air are retained in the uneven mucous membrane of the nasal cavity, so that the inhaled air is clean and non-toxic, and does not cause harm to the lungs. But people do not pay attention to this; especially when the weather is suddenly cold and windy, friends gather in the streets, talking and laughing without restraint, resulting in breathing through the mouth, the nasal defense function is completely abolished, leading to the formation of the above-mentioned nasal cold and bronchitis, which must be reviewed. If it is not easy to correct the habit for a while, a mask can be used to reduce the risk.</p>
<p>(2) Infants must sleep separately. In Chinese families, it is customary for infants to sleep in the same bed with their mothers, which is due to extreme care and the convenience of breastfeeding at night; in fact, the pollution of the air inside the quilt is undoubtedly unsuitable for infants. As a result, those who are not sick are prone to sickness, and those who are already sick are prone to complications, leading to prolonged difficulty in recovery, which is not worth it.</p>
<p>(3) Children must develop the habit of breathing fresh air. In many families, parents often forbid their children to play outdoors, and infants stay in small rooms all day long, with windows tightly closed, and even rarely exposed to sunlight, the purpose of which is to avoid the wind. In fact, the air outdoors is always fresher than indoors. As a result, their resistance becomes weaker, and when they go outdoors, they are far more likely to catch a cold than other children.</p>
<p>(4) Prevention in severe winter. In urban areas, many have cold protection equipment; this equipment varies in sophistication and is managed by individuals, each different. If you go from a place with no equipment to a place with temperature regulation, going back and forth every day, it is also easy to catch a cold; therefore, it should be minimized as much as possible within the scope of possibility.</p>
<p>When the nasal mucosa is inflamed and the secretions are abundant, and the nose is runny, people often squeeze the nose with two fingers to expel the mucus; as a result, part of the secretion is often sucked in, which is easy to cause paranasal sinusitis. If you only use one finger to hold one side of the nose, you can avoid this drawback.</p>
<h3>Editor's Note</h3>
<p>Many readers write to ask about the treatment of various diseases and hope that we will publish the answers in this newspaper. This is what we should do and are happy to do. But in fact, there are many troubles that make us unable to do so. For example, time does not allow us to do so, because we all have our own professions. In addition to reluctantly reporting some new medical and new Chinese knowledge in this publication, where is there time to answer readers? Moreover, there are great drawbacks to asking about diseases and prescribing medicine by mail. Previously, various newspapers also had very severe criticisms. Therefore, except in certain circumstances where we give appropriate instructions, we are unwilling to write them out and publish them in this publication, so as not to increase unexpected troubles. I hope that readers can forgive this difficulty! However, we must state that if readers attach an address and postage, then we always hope to take the time to answer directly.</p>
<p>Many people write to inquire about the efficacy of rheumatism and where to buy it, which shows that this disease must be very common. Unfortunately, this medicine is not yet sold in Shanghai. However, the synthesis of this medicine is not very difficult, and at present, there are bacteriology experts who are studying and manufacturing it, and we will report again if there are results.</p>
<p>Some people write to criticize the excessive medical advertisements in this publication and ask whether it is related to the Shanghai Medical Association and this publication. In fact, this association is only responsible for the manuscripts of this publication, and all advertisements are unrelated to the editorial board of this publication. Please pay attention to readers!</p>
<h3>Spray Therapy in the History of Traditional Chinese Medicine</h3>
<p>— Yang Wenyu</p>
<p>Last month, on the 7th, the Shen Kang newspaper published a news article about using spray therapy to treat asthma. It mentioned that hospitals in Shanghai have specially equipped devices for patients to use. This is a type of Western medicine treatment adopted by traditional Chinese medicine hospitals in Shanghai. However, I have also seen records in ancient Chinese history of famous doctors using this method to treat diseases. For example, in the "Biography of Xu Yinzhong" in the Book of Sui, Volume 191, there is the following passage:</p>
<p>"Xu Yinzhong was from Changzhou Yixing. He initially served in the Chen dynasty as a military advisor to the King of Jian'an. At that time, Empress Liu suffered from wind disease and could not speak. Famous doctors treated her without success, and her pulse became increasingly deep and she remained silent. Yinzhong said, 'Medicine cannot be administered through the mouth, it is better to fumigate her with medicinal vapor, allowing it to enter the acupoints. When the circulation is restored, she will recover.' He then prepared dozens of shi (a unit of dry volume) of Astragalus and Saposhnikovia Decoction and placed it under the bed, creating a vapor like smoke. That night, she was able to speak. As a result, he was promoted to Prefect of Yixing. After the fall of Chen, he entered the Sui dynasty and successively served as Attendant of the Imperial Pharmacy. In the early years of the Wude era of the Tang dynasty, bone steaming disease was prevalent in Guanzhong, and those who contracted it were sure to die, spreading from person to person. No doctor was able to cure it, but Yinzhong cured every patient he treated.'" (Omitted below) The "Biographies of Fangji" in the New Book of Tang also records this matter, attached to the biography of Zhen Quan, with similar content, so I will not repeat it. The diseases treated and the treatment methods described there are different from those mentioned in the newspaper, and it does not mention the use of any devices. However, it is clearly a form of spray therapy, which is undoubtedly true. Today's Western medicine spray therapy may have evolved from old Chinese medicine methods. However, the Chinese have never been very interested in medical research, and many secret formulas are passed down privately, refusing to be made public, leading to their loss. Even the widely known "Shen Nong's Herbal Classic" and "Yellow Emperor's Inner Classic" have mostly been distorted in transmission and placed on high shelves. Over thousands of years, there have been no new medical inventions or medicines. Even this type of vapor therapy, which appears twice in official historical biographies, is hardly known by traditional Chinese medicine practitioners. By analogy, countless effective medical prescriptions and medicines from ancient China have been lost. This is a major reason why traditional Chinese medicine cannot compete with Western medicine. I was moved by reading the newspaper and wrote this brief discussion, hoping that traditional Chinese medicine practitioners across the country will not "forget their ancestors" but quickly search through historical records and local chronicles for famous doctors and their effective prescriptions, compile them into medical books for research, and then combine them with Western medicine's scientific experiments to ensure practical application. This would not only preserve national essence but also benefit the health and well-being of the people. I dare to ask contemporary medical experts for their opinions.</p>
<p>: The above article is a submission from an outside source. Our newspaper's aim is to promote the development of medicine, which is blameless. In reality, there is no distinction between Chinese and Western medicine, only between new and old. During the Han and Tang dynasties, countless Western treatment methods were introduced from the Western Regions and have now become part of the national essence of Chinese medicine. In recent decades, many Chinese medicinal materials have been adopted by European and American countries. This shows that there is no conflict between Chinese and Western medicine, and they can indeed complement each other. In recent years, medicines like Xiaozhi Long tablets and diphtheria antitoxin have even been adopted by some traditional Chinese medicine practitioners. This further proves that "there is no such thing as Chinese or Western medicine, only new and old" is true. Today, science is all-powerful and not satisfied with just the atomic bomb. If one stubbornly clings to old-fashioned gunpowder weapons (note that gunpowder was invented in China), then it is inevitable that one will be dominated and destroyed by others.</p>
<p>Mr. Yang's article also strongly encourages traditional Chinese medicine practitioners to "quickly search through historical records and local chronicles for famous doctors and their effective prescriptions, compile them into medical books for research, and then combine them with Western medicine's scientific experiments to ensure practical application. This would not only preserve national essence but also benefit the health and well-being of the people." In fact, not only should traditional Chinese medicine adapt to the times and absorb new medical knowledge (people during the Han and Tang dynasties were even able to absorb Western Region medicine and turn it into national essence, why should we cling to outdated practices today?), but also modern Western medicine should continue to research and avoid being arrogant and thinking that simply putting up a Western medicine sign means having omnipotent skills. Today, medical science is advancing rapidly, and in a blink of an eye, yesterday's knowledge becomes outdated and is eliminated. Only those who adapt to the times and continue to improve can maintain an unshakable position.</p>
<h3>A New Method for Quitting Alcohol</h3>
<p>— Liang Junqing</p>
<p>I have previously introduced methods for relieving drunkenness in this publication, but some people think they are not thorough enough, believing that instead of seeking solutions after getting drunk, why not simply quit the habit altogether? In reality, occasional drunkenness is not harmful. Therefore, seeking solutions after getting drunk is still indispensable. However, alcohol can cloud one's judgment and harm the body. If one can naturally quit the habit, the significance would be more than just extending life! Therefore, I have written this article specifically to inform readers.</p>
<p>According to a report by Mr. Skala in America, he has used the Thiman method (Method nach J. Thiman) to help people quit alcohol with great success, which is worth introducing. Here is an excerpt translated below:</p>
<p>In the morning on an empty stomach, inject Strychnine 1mg subcutaneously into the person trying to quit alcohol. At the same time, administer a Benzedrine or Percitin tablet of 5-10mg. Two hours later, orally administer 0.07 of Emtin. After about 15 to 20 minutes, take the patient to a dimly lit, well-equipped room with beverages on display. At this time, inject a mixed preparation subcutaneously. The mixed preparation consists of Ipecac Emeti 0.05, a miotic and sudorific agent Piocarpin 0.012-0.024, and Ephedrine 0.02-0.06, which has three meanings: inducing vomiting, promoting sweating, and promoting blood circulation throughout the body. A small dose of this injectable should be used initially, and the dosage can be gradually increased depending on the situation. After injecting this mixture, have the person trying to quit alcohol select the best liquor, about 30 grams, and pour it into a small glass. Have the person carefully observe the color of the liquor, smell its aroma, and then taste it and drink it all. After several minutes, have the person drink a second 30 grams of good liquor in the same situation. At this time, the person will feel dizzy and nauseous. Then vomiting will occur. After each time they drink liquor, there will be two or three times of vomiting, completely expelling the liquor. Finally, have the person drink 100 cc of beer mixed with 0.015 of Kalium stiotaricum, so that the feeling of nausea while drinking can be maintained for a long time. This method of quitting alcohol is absolutely safe and reliable. However, if the person's pulse accelerates to 140 beats per minute, it must be stopped immediately.</p>
<p>Typically, after using the above method four to eight times, it will subconsciously form an association between drinking and nausea and vomiting. This association can make the person abhor the sight of alcohol, feel nauseous smelling alcohol, vomit when drinking alcohol, and even feel upset when thinking about alcohol. It is truly a wonderful method. However, it should be noted that the vomiting procedure after the injection should last between 20 and 35 minutes each time, and should not exceed 35 minutes to avoid affecting the heart. Also, when the person is about to drink the 30 grams of good liquor, it is best to choose high-quality liquor (such as old brandy or whiskey) at first. Then gradually switch to beer or wine. During the period of quitting alcohol, it is absolutely inappropriate to use anesthetics or sedatives. If quitting alcohol has been successful, the above method should be continued three times at intervals of two months, four months, and eight months, so that the association of aversion to alcohol can exist forever, then the person can quit alcohol completely. Although this method may cause temporary discomfort to the person, it is only temporary (at most two months), because it does not take as long as the old method, which takes at least six months.</p>
<p>Occasionally, bladder spasms, urinary urgency, and bowel urgency may occur when quitting alcohol, but they will disappear soon and there is no need to worry. If the person trying to quit alcohol has heart disease, inguinal hernia, stomach ulcers, tuberculosis, cirrhosis of the liver, or acute mental illness, this method must not be used to avoid danger.

<h3>"The New Year is Coming"</h3>
<p>— Li Zhenping</p>
<p>Books about local customs are very interesting, especially those about places where one has lived for a long time. They can reveal the lives of early settlers and the origins of certain changes. It is like a child breaking a clay pot to get to the bottom of things, which is a satisfying release of the desire for knowledge. During this time of year, it can be especially enjoyable to read them as one would feast on a roast pig, even if one cannot get the meat, it is still satisfying.</p>
<p>Recently, I saw a news report that the Ministry of Education has allocated 1 billion yuan to Peking University to purchase old books, otherwise they will all be sold to paper mills and turned into recycled paper. This news is no less shocking than the Kowloon incident. Some time ago, several speakers from the north came south to petition, saying that 500,000 yuan worth of flour in the south became 1 million yuan in Beiping, because of the 500,000 yuan per bag permit fee. Recently, it has been proven that this was done by Shanghai merchants and has nothing to do with the government. We will not concern ourselves with the specifics of these events, but the disasters that the ancient city in the snowy landscape has suffered have already surfaced in our minds. Inside and outside the city, there are refugees everywhere. At the end of the year, the price of flour will probably rise to 1.5 million yuan, right? Even Beijing and Shanghai have already exceeded 700,000 or 800,000! I myself was born in the north and know its history somewhat, so I naturally feel more sorrow and indignation about these cold facts than the average person.</p>
<p>Beiping is stubborn about old customs. Because it is Beiping, it is Beiping, the remnant of a 700-year-old imperial capital. We have only love and nostalgia for these old customs, and we never find them unreasonable. Even on the second day of the Lunar New Year, getting up early to rush to the Temple of the God of Wealth outside Zhangyi Gate to borrow two paper ingots and insert two red velvet flowers, we do not find it unpleasant. A nation has its own traditions, and a place has its own local color. We should never shallowly criticize them with materialism. The United States is such an advanced and scientific country, but in Utah, there is still the Mormon sect, Mormonism, saying that their golden Bible is secretly passed down from God, and that what others have passed down is false. How is this different from Song Jiang dreaming of the Heavenly Maiden? And St. Anne's Temple in Quebec, Canada, also has a finger bone of Saint Anne, which people worship and kiss. Isn't this just a foreign relic? The meaning is not to use foreigners to value ourselves. Santa Claus comes down the chimney, and his meaning is no different from the God of Wealth borrowing ingots. Then why can't the jumping at the Evergreen tree be changed to burning incense at midnight?</p>
<p>I have lived in Shanghai for two years and in Nanjing for more than a year. I do not see such a strong atmosphere of old New Year customs, except for the frantic price increases and workers' strikes. Unlike in the north, where in the eleventh lunar month, there are people selling pine and cypress branches, paper flowers, and New Year's pictures along the alleys, and children and old people all have a new mood and a new atmosphere, as the children's rhyme says: "Offer candy to the Stove God, the New Year is coming, girls want flowers, boys want cannons..." The customs recorded in Liu Tongren's "A Brief Record of the Scenery of the Imperial Capital" are quite worth reading, but unfortunately I do not have the book at hand, so I cannot copy some of it to give a taste of the whole. I only remember that it describes various folk customs in great detail from the beginning of the Lunar New Year to the end of the first month. Scholars and officials are mostly those who uphold tradition and often slander folk stories in vain. Liu Jun was able to overcome this obstacle and provide an objective account, so that even three hundred years later, it can still be verified. His contribution is by no means small, and it cannot be encompassed by ordinary literary history. Ju Nong of Xian Yuan's "Sounds of the Year" records the street food and toys at the end and beginning of the year, and is especially clear and understandable. Although his writing is not refined, he is telling the truth in a practical way, like seeing those old farmers wearing old cloth cotton-padded jackets, carrying two urns along the alleys on the first day of the Lunar New Year, calling out "Hey, spicy vegetables!" (a kind of pickled mustard tuber with a spicy taste, very fresh, eaten specifically before the fifth day of the Lunar New Year). As soon as they see you walking out early in the morning, they will first say "Congratulations on getting rich" to you, which, in addition to its simplicity, also has a kind of indescribable politeness. Its loveliness is no less than that of cultural relics such as the Forbidden City and Longevity Hill that are scheduled to be renovated. To be honest, I think it does not matter at all if Beiping loses its status as a capital city or if Duan Gate and Meridian Gate are in disrepair. Losing that warm human touch is the greatest loss. But with "foreign flour" costing 1.5 million yuan a bag, how can human feelings not change? According to the old rules, from New Year's Eve to the fifth day of the Lunar New Year, we must eat "boiled dumplings," which are dumplings made with the best flour and pork! Even cornbread needs to be budgeted for, so what else is there to talk about? When I was in Beiping, at first, the beggars who "delivered the God of Wealth" to each house usually started in the evening, but later it was no longer possible. People would deliver them in broad daylight, calling out "The God of Wealth is here!" across the door. If you did not accept them, they would say some nonsense, so-called "scolding and scolding." If you did accept them, it would be endlessly annoying. Since the Marco Polo Bridge Incident, these people came to bother people in the alley just after lunch. At that time, we only sighed that the price of foreign flour had risen from three yuan to seven yuan. What about now? Perhaps it is even more frugal. With paper so expensive, even the God of Wealth is avoiding it, right?</p>
<p>Dim years, dim mood, and yet encountering this holiday that cannot be avoided!</p>
<h3>A Word Worth Ten Thousand Gold</h3>
<p>— Jinjin</p>
<p>Several years ago, I read a complaint from an author in a certain publication, who deeply lamented the low rates of pay for contributions at the time. Therefore, he put forward the slogan "a word worth a thousand gold," although it was an unrealistic fantasy, it was still better than nothing. The "thousand gold" at that time was naturally incomparable to the "thousand gold" now, and the "gold" he spoke of was actually a euphemism for "yuan." However, even the thousand yuan at that time was quite a considerable amount.</p>
<p>In these times, the saying "a word worth a thousand gold" seems to be approaching its realization. Contribution fees above a certain standard seem to be generally calculated at at least one hundred gold (yuan) per word. Furthermore, if we use the most grassroots monetary unit—pancakes and fried dough sticks—for calculation, the current price of one serving of pancakes and fried dough sticks, compared with before the war, is a ratio of 4,000 yuan to 0.02 yuan, which is a full 200,000-fold increase. Then, calculating contribution fees at one thousand gold per word is equivalent to a million gold per thousand words. The number sounds a bit frightening, but in reality, it is not equivalent to five yuan per thousand words before the war. At that time, it was very common for first-class writers to earn ten yuan per thousand words. This also reflects the drastic fluctuations in the value of our country's currency, which has almost fallen sharply.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, when authors rack their brains and temporarily have no subject matter to write about, or when they have to deal with some "mundane matters" such as firewood, rice, oil, and salt, they cannot help but write about the contribution fees that they have a "visceral connection" with. This column has previously published an article about contribution fees (it seems that writing this kind of article always involves some lamentations). The author feels that his ideas are not yet fully expressed, so he will continue to add a few words here.</p>
<p>I often feel that the meager income of cultural people is not the fault of the cultural people themselves, but is due to the inherent inadequacy of the objective environment.</p>
<p>Speaking of the inherent inadequacy of the cultural industry environment, the biggest problem is that education in our country has not been universal, and most people cannot be as addicted to books and newspapers as their lives. Originally, the cultural industry could depend on industry and commerce for its survival. The more developed industry and commerce are, the more attention is paid to the effectiveness of book and newspaper advertising, which can indirectly provide strong support for the various books, newspapers, and magazines that publish advertisements. Take the United States as an example. Although the cultural industry may be a noble undertaking, the atmosphere of commerce is very strong. Several popular writers hire Press Agents to take full responsibility for publicizing them. Also, when a new book is published, the publishers take the lead in publishing full-page advertisements in newspapers such as the New York Times Book Review, listing the author's photo and various favorable comments. The situation is as lively as the fanfare for a new stage star.</p>
<p>Moreover, American writers seem to have more ways to make money than our fellow ink enthusiasts. In addition to contribution fees, they can also charge for writing short stories and novels, selling the right to reprint in various newspapers, the right to broadcast on the radio, and the right to adapt into movie scripts. In their free time, they can also give speeches in various places, sell tickets for listening to lectures, or attend parties hosted by celebrities and wealthy households, and be the honored guests at the party, truly earning both fame and wealth, no less than the most ideal occupation.</p>
<p>Therefore, since American writers have so many ways to make money, the price of a word is naturally considerable. For example, Damon Runyon, who is known as the modern O. Henry and a master of Broadway, can buy a new car for every thousand words he writes. This is much more valuable than the "a word worth a thousand gold" that our country's authors dreamed of for many years. At the end of this article, I cannot help but shout out the slogan "a word worth ten thousand gold (yuan)," which can also be regarded as a slight expression of good wishes and prayers for professional writers in the sound of the Spring Festival. If the objective situation and conditions do not change, perhaps there will be a day when it is realized next year, although no one dares to say whether ten thousand yuan at that time will be able to buy a stamp, an egg, or a fraction of a box of matches.</p>
<h3>It's Hard to Buy Books</h3>
<p>— Mang</p>
<p>There was an article in this publication about "It's Hard to Write Books." Not only is it hard to write books, but now it is also hard to buy books. It's not that you can't afford to buy them, but you can't find them, which really makes people feel like it's "hard."</p>
<p>Buying books is indeed a difficult task at present. The first thing that makes book buyers feel difficult is "can't afford it." The prices are too expensive, and most people do not have the ability to buy them. At present, the purchasing power of most people is very weak, and they cannot afford to buy ordinary daily necessities, let alone books that are considered unimportant? Moreover, book prices are too high, and even people with some purchasing power cannot afford it because they think book prices are too "expensive."</p>
<p>However, bookstore owners also have their reasons. They say: The price of paper is too expensive, and the cost of typesetting and printing is high, so the selling price cannot but be increased, otherwise they will lose money. This is a very sufficient reason. People who open bookstores also have capital, so can you ask him to lower the selling price?</p>
<p>The second difficulty people feel is "can't find it." Some people will say this: Aren't there so many books placed in bookstores, just go and buy them, who says you can't buy books? Bookstores are indeed full of books, but how many of them meet the standards and requirements? As long as you go to bookstores to take a look, most of the bookstores sell erotic novels and the like, and truly academic monographs can be said to be very few. Therefore, the second difficulty that book buyers feel is that they cannot buy the books they need. Even if there are any, they are difficult to meet their ideals, and book buyers have to spend some effort to choose. When people mention selection, they feel very difficult.</p>
<p>The last difficulty in buying books is which bookstore to go to buy from. Each store has its own views. Some hope to sell more at a lower profit, while others hope to sell less at a higher profit. Book buyers must first understand the style of the bookstore. Moreover, some bookstore clerks are friendly to people, while some bookstore clerks are not polite to people at all. Of course, we have to go to the former type of store. Since we are spending money to buy books, why should we suffer other people's ill temper? This is something that no one can tolerate, right? Sometimes, if you stand in a bookstore for a moment, the clerk will give you a "displeased look," saying that you are hindering their business. This situation is really embarrassing, but people who don't understand will be subjected to this treatment, which is also a "difficulty" for book buyers.</p>
<p>In short, everything is a "difficulty" for book buyers. If we want to solve this difficulty, we can only have readers and publishers closely linked and work together, and then there will be hope for solving these difficulties.</p>
<h3>Leisurely Flowers</h3>
<p>— Chen Shenyan</p>
<p>Chapter 10 Voluntary Sacrifice (68)</p>
<p>When Jingru saw that she spoke so sincerely and felt so earnestly, she was extremely moved. She could not help but pat Qiyun on the shoulder again and say, "You are too good! You yourself are willing to sacrifice, but my heart cannot bear it, and furthermore, Zhuji loves you deeply. You cannot reject him either. He has suffered a major stimulus, and something unexpected could happen, then my old age would be even more miserable!" Qiyun hesitated for a long time and said, "This is not a problem. I also admit that Zhuji does love me, he loves me sincerely, and that is what I admire about him. I have my own way of dealing with him. I don't need to reject him, I can make him hate me himself, and he will reject me himself. At that time, I will separate naturally without breaking up. But people who don't understand my way of doing things will definitely heap many harsh and contemptible criticisms on me. At that time, you, old sir, will hear them. You, old sir, know my difficulties, perhaps you can forgive me..." As Qiyun spoke, her face turned pale, tears filled her eyes, and she sobbed and could not speak, and she cried again. Yuru nodded and said, "Miss Gu, you are so kind to take care of my family, how can I repay you." Qiyun said, "No! It is because of this cause that there is this effect. I should not have become enamored with Zhuqi in the first place. Zhu has been married before, but once I am in love, it cannot be erased for a lifetime. I can only take this heart with me to the grave." As she spoke, she cried again. Yuru knew that her heart was struggling between reason and desire, and she was extremely sad, so she said, "Miss Gu, you are too kind. It is all because of my presumptuous visit today that you have suffered this major stimulus! You should calm down, and this matter may be carefully considered." Qiyun said, "I have already decided to do this, there is no need to consider it. While my reason is clear at this time, I can still choose a path to take, so as not to harm others. If I wait until my reason is submerged and my mind is completely surrounded by love and selfishness, then I will not be able to get rid of it, and perhaps I will do things that benefit myself and harm others. I only hope that you, old sir, will forgive me. Although I am in the pear garden circle, my family background is different from ordinary people. I value my reputation the most. I never want to do anything that would lead to bad criticism. I have decided everything, I want to protect my own reputation, and I want to protect Zhuqi's whole family. This is how I respect myself and repay you, old sir, for your teaching. Now that I have said it in front of you, old sir, I will follow my plan and go step by step. You, old sir, please rest assured. And I hope you will go back and tell the old lady that I, surnamed Gu, will not come to her house!"</p>
<h3>On Civilized Nations</h3>
<p>— Yanru</p>
<p>A few days ago, someone added a definition to "civilized nation" in the newspaper: "A civilized nation is one that necessarily allows the existence of opposing elements or groups within its borders." It was also said: "A country where the opposition slams the table and vehemently scolds in parliament, and even holds demonstrations, must be a vibrant country." This so-called civilization and vibrancy presumably refer to the United Kingdom and the United States. It is a pity that the current United States (I am not clear about the United Kingdom) has already gone from vibrancy to decline.</p>
<p>According to American history books, about ninety years ago, a senator named Sumner in that country vehemently scolded Senator Butler from South Carolina (whether he slammed the table is unknown), which enraged Brooks, a fellow senator from South Carolina and either a relative or friend of Butler. Brooks picked up a very thick cane and struck Sumner on the head, knocking him unconscious. Although it was unexpected and caught the opponent off guard, lacking chivalry, the people of South Carolina admired it greatly. In addition to treating Brooks to a grand feast, they also presented him with a new cane inscribed with exquisite words, saying: "Used to knock down those with glib tongues." The House of Representatives at that time was even more vibrant, and the attending members had to carry guns and knives to guard against any eventuality. In order to prevent a major conflict, two members from Pennsylvania and North Carolina were even placed under imprisonment, probably because these two gentlemen were prone to drawing their guns at the slightest disagreement. Such vibrancy became increasingly pronounced, eventually erupting into the Civil War, with countless deaths and immense financial cost. Now, from a peak to decline, it has reached the point of slamming tables and vehemently scolding, although it is still admired by our country's journalists, Americans probably feel that things are not as good as they used to be.</p>
<p>Based on this, when discussing the civilization and barbarity, vibrancy and decline of various countries in the world today, the United Kingdom and the United States should be considered the most civilized and vibrant, while the Soviet Union is the most barbaric and declining. The Soviet Union absolutely does not allow the existence of opposing elements or groups within its borders, and there is absolutely no opposition in the Supreme Soviet or the lowest Soviet to slam the table and vehemently scold, let alone hold demonstrations. However, this definition of a civilized nation and the notion of vibrancy are highly problematic. I do not understand why allowing opposing elements or groups within a country makes it a civilized nation. If the rulers often order the people to fast for half a month from a certain date without allowing opposing elements or groups to slam the table and vehemently scold, or even hold demonstrations, it is indeed uncivilized and lacks vitality. But if the rulers are always mindful of the people's hunger and cold, constantly checking if the people's bellies are full and if their hands are cold, providing food when they are hungry and gloves when they are cold, is it still necessary to hire some opposing elements or groups to slam the table, vehemently scold, and hold demonstrations before it can be considered truly civilized and have a vibrant atmosphere?</p>
<p>Frankly speaking, writing articles is easy, but giving definitions is very difficult, so I will not give this definition: A sycophant is a thief of virtue.</p>
<h3>Serial Detective</h3>
<p>— Tuo</p>
<p>Private Detective: I followed your husband and found him going to three nightclubs and two bachelor apartments.</p>
<p>Suspicious Wife: Oh my! What was he doing?</p>
<p>Detective: Following and investigating your actions!</p>
<h3>Progress</h3>
<p>— Fangji</p>
<p>A propagandist stood on the podium and enthusiastically said: "Moscow's economic construction has progressed much more than before. The twenty-story building standing on Marx Street is one example." An enthusiastic listener immediately stood up to correct his mistake, saying: "I walk on Marx Street every day, and I haven't seen a twenty-story building!" The propagandist immediately retorted: "You are really too stupid. Why do you waste your time walking on the street? Can't you read the news about national construction in the newspaper?"</p>
<h3>Food and Housing in Old Beijing</h3>
<p>High prices and the difficulty of living are a common lament everywhere, even if expressed in a single word. Among the four essential elements of "clothing, food, housing, and transportation," the "housing" aspect seems easier to solve in old Beijing than in Shanghai and Hankou. This is partly because of the wide-open space, with the inner and outer cities stretching over forty miles, and families of all sizes having their own courtyards and gardens, rarely with "houses on top of houses," often giving visitors from other places the impression of a garden. It is also because, since the government moved south, Beijing has long lost its political center and is not a trading port, with government offices no longer comparable to the former ministries and departments in Beijing. Travelers seeking fame and fortune no longer "flock from all over the country." Therefore, the ratio of population to land area is naturally not too high. In general, the housing shortage in Beijing is not so severe that people have to "pile on" or "scramble" to live in the same place.</p>
<p>However, the fact that this ancient city can still maintain the appearance of a considerable metropolis is largely due to the large number of academics. After all, it is a "cultural city" and the location of the highest institutions of learning. Several universities, including Peking University, Tsinghua University, Yenching University, Sino-French University, and various private colleges, have a long history and a large scale, attracting scholars from all over the country who travel thousands of miles to study. In the political circles, from the central government agencies to the local government agencies, there are also all kinds of positions. As for the business and industrial sectors, the book and antique businesses are mostly run by people from Hebei (south of Baoding, to Jizhou, Nangong, etc.); the exchange houses, paint shops, and dried fruit shops are mostly run by people from Shanxi; the silk and satin businesses, restaurants, meat shops, grain shops, and coolies are mostly run by people from Shandong. These are the three major components of Beijing's market. Because of transportation obstacles, their hometown houses and fields have been "liquidated," leaving them homeless and stranded in the ancient city. Their fellow villagers and children flock to Beijing to avoid "struggle" or conscription, thus creating a situation where the true desolation of the countryside and the false prosperity of the city are mutually dependent.</p>
<p>Among the three aspects of housing—buying and selling, mortgaging, and renting—the most troublesome is mortgaging. Ten years ago, one or two thousand yuan could mortgage a small courtyard house. If the original contract stipulated that it could be redeemed at the original price after ten years, then today's one or two thousand yuan cannot even buy half a steamed bun. Even two or three years ago, those who borrowed cash by mortgaging their house deeds or other items now want to redeem them at the original price, but the currency value has changed greatly. As a result, disputes arise, with each party sticking to its own version of the story, which is often seen in newspapers, causing readers to smile wryly.</p>
<p>The matter of renting simple houses has already led to many strange dramas since the period of occupation, due to the inflation of counterfeit currency. Landlords do not collect rent, and tenants deposit the rent in banks or post offices, publishing notices in newspapers stating that they are not responsible for owing rent, which has added many deposits to banks, while newspapers have increased a large amount of advertising revenue, reaping the benefits of both sides. The two sides argue over the value of the currency, calculating the past and present, leaving onlookers unable to judge who is right or wrong, and only able to recognize it as a tragicomedy caused by economic changes of the times.</p>
<p>However, recently, the practice of using "flour" as the standard for rent has become a very common and open fact. In important areas, some people demand one or two bags per room per month, while even small houses with fewer than ten rooms in remote areas require this amount. As a result, the slogan of "one bag of flour, one house, one month" or the "Three Ones Doctrine" is the most popular. With the price of flour averaging one million yuan per bag according to the market price of previous years, a family living in a small house would have to bear a staggering amount of legal tender for rent alone. However, using flour as a standard can save the trouble of re-evaluating the currency value every month. Although tenants feel oppressed by the excessive price, they also find it convenient because there is a standard to avoid haggling.</p>
<p>Although landlords seem to be in a high-pressure situation of owning property, they also complain endlessly. Because renting out a house, regardless of its size, does not necessarily mean getting just one bag of flour according to the usual practice. Now, they have no choice but to ask for one bag of flour and are still scolded. And with the repeated increases in tenants who do not pay rent or who sublet fraudulently, and with the government adjusting land prices and imposing house taxes everywhere, those who say that owning property is enjoyable may be unaware of "one family's troubles."</p>
<p>Because rent is based on "flour," the problem of "housing" still needs to be solved by "food." It can be seen that among the four essential elements of life, "food" is still the most important. "The country takes the people as its foundation, and the people take food as their heaven" is a statement that cannot be refuted. The order of "clothing, food, and housing" is a natural habit of the sound and tone of the words, not that "food" is ranked after "clothing." This can be proven by the fact that "hunger" and "satisfaction" are above "cold" and "warm" in the phrases "hunger and cold" and "satisfaction and warmth."</p>
<p>The North uses flour as the standard because most northerners are accustomed to eating flour, and flour bags are relatively easy to count. In the South, which is not accustomed to flour, should it be based on "rice"? Should it be discussed in terms of "packages," "pounds," "pecks," or "rooms"? Should it be a building? Or should we not use real objects at all?</p>
<p>Editor's note: The other day, I returned late at night and chatted with a rickshaw puller, who told me that villagers are flocking to Shanghai like a tide, overjoyed to have a place to shelter from the wind and rain. As a result, the business of building straw sheds for rent in the suburbs is very prosperous, with each shed costing four to six pecks of rice per month.</p>
