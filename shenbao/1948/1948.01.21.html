<h3>選舉首屆立法委員　全國各地今日開始　主席曁夫人將親行投票</h3>
<p>〔中央社南京廿日電〕立法委員選舉，自廿一日起在全國四十七省市，蒙古十八盟旗，西藏三選區，邊疆民族穴省，僑民十五選區同時舉行投票。凡年滿廿歲而具右選權之男女公民，均將按規定程序參加投票。據悉：業經辦理選舉人登記之選民數約二億五千萬人，而全國各地參加立委競選之候選人亦在二千人以上，本屆應產生之立委，則應爲七百七十三人。</p>
<p>〔本報南京廿日電〕我國第一屆立法委員選舉，定廿一日起在全國各地投票，迎續三日，共將選出立委總額七七三名，其中男性六九一名，女八十二人，京市選舉共分十三區，設九十五個投票所，蔣主席暨夫人均將以公民資格親往投票。京市各立委候選人之競選活動，已至白熱化階段。又京市女立委候選人黎劍虹前經國民黨中常會通渦爲候補候選人後，聞頃經蔣總裁之核定，決仍維原　，在劉蘅　外，不增女性候選人名額，中常會已通知選　取消。</p>
<p>〔中央社開封廿日電〕豫立委選舉，以匪擾縣份交通梗限，選民數　尚未　齊，同時政黨提名立委名單，中央頒到省過晚，選票印製不及，勢難加期舉行。省選所昨臨時會，經愼重硏討後，決定本省立委選舉，俟一切準備就緒後再另定選期。</p>
<p>〔中央社長春廿日電〕全國性職業團體立法委員選舉東北區候選人名單，已全部到長，市選所今正式公告。其他所有一切選舉事宜，亦均己準備就緒，候省選所電　確定選舉日期後，即可公告選舉。</p>
<p>〔中央社南京廿日電〕總選所主席委員張厲生於立委選舉前夕答覆記者詢問稱：立委選舉，其進行步驟與國代選舉並無不同，惟立委選舉投票係用圈選法，各區候選人名單已印列選舉票上，選舉人僅須憑其自由之選擇，圈定其理想中之一人，即已完成選舉任務，惟可注意者，端在「自由投選意志」。按選舉習慣，吾人舉行任何投票，均應恪守秘密塡票之法則，投票人無須將被選人姓名示知他人，而外人亦不應獲悉其投選者之姓名，蓋在民主政治中，應以尊重他人之自由爲最高之道德，探知他人投選之對象，實有妨害其自由選權之嫌。張氏復稱：總選所刻已通令各選所，切實遵照選舉程序及總所指示改進各點，如期進行辦理，不得稍　時限及與法規不合之處，對全國選民於國代選舉期　之執列情緒，張氏極感欣慰。氏繼　：根據目前各地選所對選務甚多之改進，本屆立委選舉自當較前屆國代票選尤爲進步，參加投票選民，亦必更形踴躍。（各地競選情形刋二版一欄）</p>
<h3>我技術代表團　會晤美方官員　對援華計畫開始討論</h3>
<p>〔中央社華盛頓十九日電〕我國赴美技術代表團，十九日晚在此與美國務院官員及經濟專家若干人會晤，美國援華之正式討論，於焉開始。馬歇兒未在塲，顧大使於十九日短促之會議後稱：　助理國務卿索普領導之國務院官員，已完全同意我代表團之意兄，即擬議中之援助計劃必須儘　推行，以適應中國嚴重之局勢。十九日之會議，係「拜會」性質，俾便交歡與互換意見。我代表　　長貝祖詒稱：關於我技術方　立即開會討論援助計劃之準備，今已告竣，此間據悉：早由國務院擬就之援助計劃，在經與中國代表國商討後，即將提送國會，至美援華之確切範圍與性質，非至國會接獲國務院之要求後，不致發表。據以往消息，該項要求總數，將約及三億美元，顧大使出席今日之會議，與會者有我國代表團團員五人，即貝祖詒，李　，洪紳，陳良輔與朱葆眞，　方人員除索普外，其他國務院官員與會者爲遠東司司長白德華，投資及經濟開發司司長海佛立克及中國科助理科長斯數魯斯，十九日中午我代表團由索普招待，在政府賓館午宴，顧大使，證紹華與陳之邁亦在座，半小時前，在對街之白宮與杜魯門總統晤談之馬歇爾國務卿未參加，雖我代表團已準備訪晤馬卿，惟確切日期尚未確定，惟預料不入即可曾晤，此間傳聞中國代表將得事先研究國務院之援華計劃，該計劃自去年四月以來，即在研究中，且料不數日即可提交國會矣。</p>
<h3>孔祥熙發表談話　美援華即係自助　對改革幣制主採金本位</h3>
<p>〔中央社紐約十九日合衆電〕孔祥熙告合衆社　稱：渠相信十億美元貸款，將足可充作穩定中國新貨幣之準備金，而貨幣之穩定，則爲中國復興之基礎。渠稱：此項貸款可於十五年至二十年間償還，此爲振興中國經濟萎頹之一步驟。孔氏闡釋謂：過去中國可靠輸出及海外僑匯方面，維特其貨幣之穩定，此種海外僑匯，每年總數達二億美元，然今日中國國內商品貨物旣形稀少，結果遂有囤積與通貨膨脹之情事發生，通貨膨脹，致使國家預算增加，其結果復使通貨益形膨脹，此問題之唯一解決方案，厥爲收回舊貨幣，而以黃金爲穩固基礎，發行新貨幣。此十億美元，又將自何處借得，孔氏稱：「就余所知，中國官員在此方面尚未有所討論，蓋中國尚未準備提出適當之理由」。然孔氏繼警告稱：「目前犬國援華空氣甚囂塵上，吾人歡迎此項友誼表示，其簡單原因，係在今日中國正傾力撲滅禍患，此患並即將威脅美國。在戰時，中國曾　美國獲得軍事援助，今日中國實需要彈藥，以繼續執行戡亂工作，美國或可覺察其在避免此種威脅方面之利益，蓋美國之援華，實係自助也」。孔氏並引據中國諺語云：「拔一髮面牽動全身」。渠繼稱：中國情勢與此類似，蓋世界　天下一家也。中國內亂影響全世界，故爲世界利益計，而尤爲美國利益計（因美國在此方面得失甚大），中國之內亂，當應戡平。</p>
<h3>魯克斯力促援華　主張擴大訓練新軍計畫　巴爾定明自美啟程來華</h3>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓廿日電〕前駐華美軍事顧問團長魯克斯少將，廿日在此問宣稱：「中國國民政府爲生存而作戰，力促擴大美國軍事代表團，對蔣主席之士兵，施以實際戰鬥技術之訓練。」魯氏繼稱：「巾共並非」政黨，而係擁有武裝之「國家」，在與國軍作戰中，每能繫中國軍之要害」。魯克斯力斥關於國民政府官史貪汚之報告，係「誇大其辭」與「一知半解」，力促援助國民政府，不問其在內戰解決前進行改革與否。魯氏不願詳論援華計　，　：「此係高於吾之地位者之事」。惟就軍事方面言之，渠稱：渠贊同擴大開始於台灣訓練中國師團之計劃。並稱：目前所需者，係一新兵輪　訓練計劃，敎練中國士兵如何射擊與開步走。渠主張擴大此項現在最高當局考慮下之計劃，魯氏警告稱：中國軍事局勢迅速趨向惡劣，中共裝備，較日軍爲　。魯氏指出，美國務部目前政策，限於美國爲中國所提出之計劃範圍以內，祇在訓練中國敎官。但渠極力表示，認爲美國陸軍人員，應　接監督中國在戰塲上之軍隊，魯克斯稱。渠並未見到中共由蘇供給裝備之直接證據，但稱：共軍領袖，係同一類受訓於同一學校之共黨。按魯克斯在　約近兩年，將由巴爾少將代替渠在華之職，巴爾定於廿二日乘機飛華履新。</p>
<h3>台灣練兵　成績良好</h3>
<p>〔合衆社台灣鳳山電〕台灣中。美兩國軍事當局均稱，在美國第廿六軍　顯問　顧問之下孫立人將軍主持下中國訓練新兵計劃非常成功。是項成就均由於中國人本身之努力，美國方面僅作證問耳。</p>
<p>訓練新兵之規模究有多大，目前尚未知悉，然據美軍發　人估計，如日軍原有之一切設施能得充分利用，則台灣可訓練新兵二十萬名，而目前僅有第二百十五師之靑年軍二萬人在訓練中，訓練基地在台南鳳山附近，爲日本第九十八軍之根據地。</p>
<p>美國顧問有鮑林上校領導下之軍官十七人及美兵九人，美方對華方之合作精神頗加贊許。某高級美軍軍官評論一一五師之軍氣稱：該師之紀律，可與世界任何優秀之軍隊媲美。</p>
<p>孫立人屬下之助手，均爲著名新一軍之軍官，雖在物資甚爲缺乏之下，仍能在逼眞之作戰狀况下受訓，騎兵訓練亦將於本月份開始。</p>
<p>軍訓中心有其自己之工業給養，訓練時對個別兵士之體格尤爲注意，彼等受與一般美國兵同樣之體育訓練。</p>

<p>〔本　南京二十日電〕東北剿匪總司令衛立煌，定廿一日專機飛　赴任，廿日晚六時許應張　晚宴，並於九時三度晋謁蔣主席，主席就東北　　軍事詳細指示。據　氏廿日晚六時語本　詎者，　於東北剿匪計劃、俟本人抵　與陳兼主任及東北將領會　　始可決定，外傳已決定若干計劃說不確，至　　總部副總司令及參謀長人選。亦尚未決定，郭寄　將出任剿匪總部參謀長說，純系謠言。衛氏主張一切應做後再說，在未抵東北前，一切情形尚未明瞭，故不願多發表意見。　衛氏對外間所傳今後東北剿匪軍事，將採重點主義，撤出若千凸出地區說，已予否認。（東北及皖省旅京同鄉歡迎衛氏消息刋版三欄）</p>

<h3>社論　亞洲和平的新曙光</h3>
<p>在動　不　的目前世界局勢下，從亞洲若干地　傳來的消息，告訴我們在那些地區茲已獲得和平合作的新基礎，實在使我們感到非常欣慰。亞洲的若干地區當然不是指亞洲的全部；但當我們想到這些地區因其背景的複雜，鬥爭的深刻，如今竟能獲得和平合作的基礎。益使我們對於這些喜訊的傳來，寄予股切的期望。所謂道些地區傳來的喜訊，不用說，第一是甘地的絕食因而獲得印回錫克三族問的和平合作基礎；第二便是印度尼西亞與荷蘭間協定的成立。印度尼西亞問題及印度和巴基斯坦間的爭執，並由此爭執而引起　印回錫克問的大屠殺，誰都知道是不易解決的問題：如今各方却已成立協議，此後不僅有解決途徑可循，而且還可以看到亞洲和平的遠景。在規在這種國際形勢下，此項消息的傳來，實　　該具有一種安定的作用。</p>
<p>關於印度，自英國撤回印度，乃印度聯邦和巴基斯坦「道米寗」成立以米，世人對於這兩新邦的期望，無可諱言的，因了彼此間的屠殺而瀕於幻滅。此兩新邦誕生不久，即掀起了暴動屠殺，印回人民之流血以死者，數以萬計；田園荒蕪，生靈　炭。近自喀什米爾事變以來，印度與巴基斯坦間已臨吟戰爭的邊緣，雙方向聯合國呼籲調停，而雙方却各在其境內進行無辜人民的屠殺，情形之慘，世所罕見。在此情形之下，七十八歲的老翁聖雄甘地，於是復以絕食，呼籲和平，並提出合作計劃七點：　允許　敎徒在德里附近每年舉行的宗敎賽會；　逃亡到巴基斯坦的回敎徒應該允許他們安全返回德里；　在九月暴動期間　印度敎徒所占用的回數　拜寺一百一十七所應該返還回方；　保證德里各處回敎徒的安全；　取消錫克族對回方的抵制運動；　保證回敎徒可以在火軍上安全旅行；和　印度和錫克難民不得侵占德里冋敎徒的區械。</p>
<p>甘地於提出此項合作計劃後。隨即於十二日開始絕食，過了六日，此一計劃即爲各方所接受，聖雄亦即於十八日下午十二時四十五分停止絕食。這一百二十二小時的絕食。據報傳消息已獲得下列數種勝利：　印度同意對巴基斯坦恢復財政付款；　印度各官員皆允諾推進　自治領問之良好關係；　新德里居民自去年九月以後首次允許大批回敎徒在街上行走；　新德里被錫克敎　印度敎難民所侵占之一百十七所回教堂已自行撤讓；　在巴基斯坦辛德城之議會，允諾改善印回　係；　印度敎極端派領袖西伐克辛，爲新德里引起反回敎糾紛主要人物之一，允許遵守甘地之和平建議。同時，據成功湖方而傳來消息，印度與巴基斯坦，關於喀什米爾問題，亦　接受聯今國調解，雙方不得有足以使局勢更趨惡化的談話和措施。是由於甘地的絕食，對印度局勢顯已產生安定的效果。</p>
<p>至於印度尼西亞局勢，自日本投降以來，　未獲致解決，其間雖有林加椰帶協定，然協定之墨瀋未乾，而流血事件又起。荷蘭軍隊對於　印尼軍隊曾加　伐。可是荷關常局觀乎目前國際局勢的動盪。自獲　若干勝利以後，深知善用兵者以不用兵爲上之兵法，迄未　進，加以窮追。一面又利用聯合國這一組織，經由聯合國委員會，提出和解條款六點，業於本月十九日爲印荷雙方所接受。此一協定規定　權生　　的印尼土坦以全民投票來決定；雖此項投票未必能於今年舉行，但由於此一協定的簽立，無疑地，已獲致了澄清印度尼西亞局勢　基礎；此　循此基　而進行，印度尼西亞問題　必能　致　滿解決　。</p>
<p>由於此　消息的傳來，我們除　印度，巴基斯坦　印度尼西亞深致慶宰外，誠不免感觸多端。第一，印回　　　　三家，祗以彼此積年的猜忌，彼此未能相　以誠，　是　接　　兩新邦的　生，便有　動流血　件的發生。甘地絕食，使三方面能够拋棄疑猜，重歸於好，是　　於甘　精　感召力的偉大，亦爲三方能以人民福利爲重，顯仝大局，拋棄成見的表微。須知印回錫克之間不特宗敎信仰不同，抑且生活習慣大相縣殊，猜疑嫉恨，由來己久。如今　能重歸　好，就是他們深明大志，能以民獻利　爲上；由於此一協定　成立，頓使暗澹前　變爲光明。第二，講到印度尼西亞與荷蘭之間，原本存着統治與被統治的關係；如今荷蘭政府　　時艱，不爲已甚，此固足以表示海牙政府所抱政策的開明，而印尼共和國當局的能以大局爲重，卒能獲致　議，尤足爲世人稱道。第二，由於印度及印度尼西亞局勢。重新獲得了安定的基礎。回顯我國內局勢，益使我們認識我國局勢之所以迄未能獲得安定的基礎者，實由於我們有不以民族利益爲重，不顧大局　此匪在作亂。印回錫克有宗敎信仰上及生活習慣上的不冋，印尼和荷蘭有種族文化上的不同，但他們郤都能成立協議，奠定了此後合作的新基礎；獨有我們的共匪旣沒有種族文化上的不同，也沒有生活習慣上的不同，而他們郤不顯大局興兵作亂。我們爲了我們民族的生存，應使戡亂及早完成；是則每個國民的責住，都應就其本位，積極動員參加。等到戡亂勝利完成以後，我們纔能有安定的新基礎。</p>

<h3>社會黨大會結束片山繼任委員長　內部勢力可免重大變化</h3>
<p>〔新亞社東京廿日電〕日社會黨大會最後一日選舉最高人員節目，舉行頗為順利，黨首問題左右兩派似已呢妥協，左派并未將松本提名競選，故片山哲安然繼任委員長。書記長一職雖有加藤十與淺沼稽次郎競選，然因四黨黨政策協定旣已通過廢除，左右在人事方面亦表示讓步，故淺沼以中間派身份代西尾任書記長。由此人事選任之結果，社黨內部勢力免重大變化。</p>
<h3>美國絕對安全唯有廢止戰爭　美軍政各領袖所獲結論</h3>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓十九日電〕華盛頓官方對於今日世界危機之觀察，明白反映美國安全寄於非軍事措施以防止另一次戰爭之信念，此乃政府各領袖與各專家意見之結論。數日以來，國會各委員會會聽取國務部長馬歇爾，國防部長福萊斯泰及陸軍部長羅雅爾之嚴重報告，總統且接得航空政策委員會之報告。此種報告，綜合觀之，可得一致結論，即戰爭有可能必，美國之眞正安全繫於用政治與經濟行動加以防止。但航空政策委員會亦稱：「據最初印象，大戰似不致在今後五年內發生。最高軍事當局已向本會表示此種見解。」美國建國以來任何承平時代，甚至在珍珠港事變前數星期，華盛頓方面對於戰爭危機之關切，無如今日之甚。防止戰爭之方法，尤其是假定美國不能防止戰爭所受之影響，正使政府中人及接近政府人士煞費時間與思索，較其他任何問題為甚。航空政策委員會之報告稱：「自身軍備之保護，僅能使美國獲得比較的安全。第二良策在於獲得條約上的安全，美國之絕對安全，唯有廢止戰爭。」福萊斯泰向衆院委員會稱：建立强大的防軍以代替對歐濟援助，實屬謬誤，徒然形成「武裝的休戰」。羅斯福夫人新近遊歐返國，向全國女記者協會稱，蘇聯一俟吾人有隙可乘，即將攻擊美國各種政策。蘇聯僅崇尚力量，美國必須强盛。但羅夫人亦强調避免戰爭一點，謂此乃美國安全之眞正保障。綜上所述，可見能再希望逃避戰爭之物質的影響，甚至不能在另一次戰爭的中獲勝。航空政策委員會之報告並稱：「吾人必須計及本國可能遭受攻擊。吾人必須假定未來侵略者決不使美國能發動工業力量。如欲取勝，必須於閒戰一擊加以毀滅。」該委會預料一九五二年底美國將不能趕上時代。一九五二年後，美國人必須假定他國已造成原子彈武器，可向美國使用。馬歇爾·福萊斯泰與羅雅爾之意見，均係在國會討論馬歇爾援歐計劃時提出。</p>
<h3>分配義艦成立協議　蘇聯得三分之一</h3>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓十九日電〕今日確悉：明國對於義大利兵艦分配問題，現已成立協議。其詳細辦法，官方雖尚保守秘密，但聞其中三分之一將給予蘇聯。依照該項協議規定，蘇聯可分得二萬三千噸戰鬥艦「西薩勒」號一艘，巡洋艦「奧斯泰」號一艘及其他艦船三十七艘。</p>

<h3>節省美元開拓市塲　英確定貿易政策　現與歐洲七國談判商約</h3>
<p>〔路透社倫敦十九日電〕英商務部長威爾遜今日在記者招待會上，報告英國與丹，比，荷，捷，芬，南斯拉，瑞士等歐洲七國之貿易關係，茲分誌如下：丹麥：英丹貿易談判繼續進行中，英已能以煤斤供給丹麥，當以一部份次要物品，與丹交換英國所需之物。</p>
<p>關於價格方面，雙方距離已近，談判結果殊可樂觀。荷蘭：荷英於上月曾在倫敦舉行貿易談判，雙方所開貨品名單在審查中，二月初可在海牙恢復談判。比利時：英比談判正在倫敦舉行，兩國貿易年內可望激增。瑞士：英國最近已與瑞士開始談判，英國對瑞輸出約三倍於自瑞士之輸入。南斯拉夫：英國對南談判始於去年八月，南代表團領袖柯浦柯克返貝爾格萊德請示後，尚未返倫敦，英方預料不久終能成立若干協定。捷克：英國希望不久能與捷克決定開始貿易談判之日期，惟雙方對於必需要及可能供給之物已在計議之中。芬蘭：芬貿易代表團定二月十六日來英檢討兩國間貿易支付之整個問題。威爾遜繼曰：英政府最重視之市塲為加拿大，美國及阿根廷，政府已令出口商特別注意對該三國之發展，以爭取美元。以言英國對外貿易談判之目標，在儘可能少用英國之黃金及美元資源，而獲得必需品之輸入。國際貿易全以交換主要物品目標之觀念，對於英國有極大不利，同時英國並將企求移除他國對於輸入英貨之限制。</p>
<h3>調處喀什米爾糾紛　印馬代表獲協議　安理會兒三國委會參加調停</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕紐約廿日廣播：成功湖訊，今日安理會通過決議，派三國委員會前往喀什米爾，調處印巴爭端在表決時計有九票贊成，蘇聯與烏克蘭棄權。</p>
<p>〔路透社成功湖廿日日電〕安全理事會於廿日標準時間下午三時三十分開會繼續討論喀什米爾問題時，將審查印度與巴基斯坦代表週末舉行秘密圓桌會議後所成立之妥協方案。</p>
<p>〔美國新聞處成功湖十九日電〕駐聯合國之印度與巴基斯坦代表，十九日正在考慮安理會之建議，即設立三人調處委員會，協助調解喀什米爾糾紛。此項建議，係由安理會主席比利時代表蘭根霍夫所提出，其形成將與調處印荷糾紛之三國委員會相似。</p>
<p>〔聯合社新德里十九日電〕甘地今日表示，對於終止絕食後世界各國發來之電報，感激良深，永銘心版。</p>
<h3>英經濟危機　局勢已趨嚴重　美援歐計劃似已過遲</h3>
<p>〔合衆社倫敦廿日電〕英高級政府方面廿日警告，英國之黃金及美元準備在七月以前，將達「危險階段」，且生活水凖將不得不「可怕地緊縮」。若馬歇爾之援助不降臨。美元及黃金之枯竭，乃「極危險」，雖則上月起努力遏制外幣之費用。收入與支出之豁裂縮短，但除非「吾人能採取步驟遏制再縮小吾人之黃金及美元準備，最嚴重之局勢似將發展。」若干方面相信，馬歇爾計劃對直接援助英國之一九四八年度經濟計劃之遲矣。</p>
<h3>義瑞簽訂　貿易協定</h3>

<h3>改善公務員生活　指數怎樣編造</h3>
<p>〔中央社南京十九〕文武職人員依照生活費指數發薪的辦法，經立法院建織，監察院和參政會之一再呼籲，主計處主持之公敎人員待遇調整計劃委員會及國務委員會所指定之特種審査委員會，不少次歡之集會商討，其中經過幾許波折，始於本月十三日行政院例會中通過，由一有份實行，雖然是依照十二月份的生活費指數試辦，及每三個月才調整一次，但能依照生活費指數之升降而調整，總較過去加百分之幾之辦法，來得合理，而且依照生活費指數調整之法，試辦以後，總可望逐漸改善。關於公務員生活費指數的意義及其編造經過，記者今日往訪主計處主計長徐堪，及該處統計局副局長趙章　，暢談二小時後才透澈了解。</p>
<p>生活費指數　國民政府主計處所線的却在公務員生活必需品中選出二十八種爲代表，調査其價格，再參考家計調査和衛生營養的標準，確定一個成年男性公務員，他每月所需要的各項生活必需品的最低數量，例如米兩斗啦，布三尺啦等等，這些則稱爲權數，均各乘其價格，相加之後，而得總消費値，依照加權總値式之方式，以道一期的總消費値除基期，總消費値，即得到總比率，這就是公務員生活費指數了。</p>
<p>今舉一個實例來說：民國二十六年上半年南京每個成年男子，平均每個月總消費値爲十五元零四分，卅六年九月時的南京總消費値增加到五十四萬三千三百五十元一角九分，生活費指數則爲三萬六千一百廿七小數點零一倍。</p>
<p>採用之物品　公務員生活費指數所名稱，品質，計算單位，及其權數如下：</p>
<p>「非常時期改善公務員生活辦法」中所選定之物品與數量，僅就一般必需而言，却爲公務員之生活最低限度，但其標準，均有所根據。如食物類言：這和中央衛生實騐院所擬公務員營養素所需食物標準，相去無幾。該院所擬者，計榖類二十九斤，蔬菜三十七斤半，豆腐十五斤，肉類五斤半，鷄蛋三十個，油脂四十五兩。</p>
<p>依照公務員　生活費指數查經辦法，據主計處所編出的公務員生活費指數的結果，均較同月同地之躉售或零售物價指數都低。舉個例來說：</p>
<p>由前面的例十來看，三十六年九月份南京的零售物價指數，爲戰前四萬三千九百多倍，　售，物價指數亦在四萬三千多倍，但公務員生活費指數却僅有三萬六千多倍·三者相去很遠，這裏的理由，據編公務員生活費指數的人解釋，謂：　售物價指數，包含五　及建築材料之價格，零售物價指數則包含一部份嗜好品或奢侈品，且物品之種類亦較多，代表範圍較廣，蕪公務員生活費指數僅包含最倫約的生活必需品廿八種，月受加權之限制，如衣着類較各類價格選價均高，但每月需量只有三尺，這種影響生活費指數不大，這就是公務員生活費指數比　售或者零售物價指數低的現由·（記者鄒克定）</p>

<p>〔本報蘭州十四日航訊〕抗戰期中，許多足不出戶的人們，曾做了長途的旅行家，見多識廣，得到了許多的閱歷，不能不算是一種意外的收穫。就拿記者作比吧，這八年中，雖然完全是在西南　省兜圈子，確也增進了不少的知識，可惜竟莫有機會到西北，不免心　往之然而對於這些邊遠的區域，也不過以爲是風沙荒凉而在這交通如此的困難，生活又如此的鬧人，最近竟因爲一種突然的事情，居然得到過一趙蘭州，住在新型的西北大厦內，蹓養在中山，中正，左公等馬路上，一切的觀感，都與我想像的適成相反，眞可算得是我一種稀有的機遇。</p>
<p>甘肅是貧瘠的省份，土地遼闊，人口稀少，生產也並不豐富。省會蘭州市居然建設到已可配合時代的地步，省立機器廠，化工材料廠，煤礦廠，水利局，運輸處，自來水廠，都陸續的建立成功了。這很可證明負責者確有埋頭苦幹的精神。甘省主席郭寄　將軍，安徽合肥人，時代需要他在這裏努力。地大人少的地方，最適當的工作，莫如生產建設，郭將軍看準了這一點，埋顯苦幹。他說政治，文化，心理等各部門的建設，非從民生的經濟建設入手不可，非此也談不上和國防建設相配合。郭將軍對此，感到甚大的興趣，也有最大決心和信心·整個的甘肅省的生產建設，他已擬定了很周密的計劃，並且準備着在一年之內要完成下面的經濟建設方案，我相信國人一定能給以觀麼與支援。</p>
<p>總的原則　（一）本省經濟建設，以　展民生建設，達成國防需要爲方針。　農收與工礦並重——以農牧生產之增加，農村經濟之繁榮，爲工礦事業之基礎；以工礦事業之進步，爲改善農經營，提高人民生活之手段。　基本工業與民生工業相輔並進——以民生工業（衣食住及日常交通敎育文化之所需）之發展保障基本工業（礦業，機械，動力）之奠立：以基本工業之擴張，爲增進生產充實國防之根本。　公營民營及合作方式密切配合——以大規模之公營事業，爲提高技術水準，開拓省外市塲之示範，同時輔　奬助民營事業之發展。更積極促進合作一組織，使大多數農民及小手工業一者，能直接經營產銷分配等業務</p>
<p>（二）本省經濟建設，應動員全省人力物力財力，按一定計劃，循序推進。並力求利用外來助力，以期連效·　財政金融經濟之措施統一化—以財政輔助金融，以金融促進經濟，以經濟充實財政，庶收　絡一貫，活　運用之功，　分層負責，逐級協助輔導—各區各縣，應根據建設工作綱領之規定，因地制宜，擬訂以區縣爲單位之建設計劃，在省之審議考核下，負責完成，其不能自行籌劃之人才或資力由省予以輔助。　配合國家機關增强推動力量—在省政府主管部門應硏究與中央技術機關連繫合作，以期能切實輔導本建設事業；並與國家金融機關及經濟建設主管部門，詳密研討投資貸款或協助設備之方式以充裕資金擴大規模。（四）號召國外投資及技術指導——依據中央規定，參酌本省需要，數迎國際投資及技術人才。　奬勵私人從事建設——政府認爲必要之事業，而宜於由私人經營者，得予以購取土地，充實設備，及採購運銷之便利。並可視省之財力酌予保付最低股息及利潤，私人之發明，應予以保障及獎勵。（三）建設事業需要人才：應逐漸培育，以充實本省建設之領導人才及中級幹部——力謀教育與建設配合，獎助小學生並酌行考送大學生或資送專門人員出國留學實習，以培植高級專門人才，發展職業敎育，儲備經濟建設各部門之實用技術人才。尤注重交通·水利。農林。畜牧·獸醫·化工及紡織專門人才之培養。</p>
<p>一般建設　（一）交通建設爲發展農工業之前提，除協助中央興修隴海鐵路，天蘭及蘭安兩段外，並完成標進公路二千公里，全省主要大車道及重要水道，亦分別興修整理完竣。（二）水利建設完成五十萬畝灌溉工程，河西部份仍照十二年計劃繼續進行，同時完成保持水土之水平溝二萬五千萬立方尺，以免除約三千方公里之山洪，幷完成五十萬畝農田鋪砂，計劃繼進行全省水利調査。（三）農林建設，注重農業技術之改進，舉凡土壤及肥料之改良，農業品種之檢定培育，病蟲害之防治，農具之改善，必須兼籌幷　，期能增加主要食糧產量百分之十五，同時完成全省天然林調査，實行收歸國有，并獎勵人民造林一千方里，另於全省農村植樹二萬萬株，以上　着重於荒山造林。（四）改良畜牧，從防治獸疫改良品種改善營養三方面人手。擴大注射山羊血毒，防治牛瘟，幷舉辦畜類寄生蟲及傳染病硏究，同時辦理各種家畜引種實騐，與推廣，一面保護草原，以山坡蓄水方法，增加收草產量百分之十，并籌設或充實畜牧　醫硏究機構。（五）丫業以建立毛紡織工業與化學工業爲重點，使能逐漸完成粗呢與　嘰乳品及乾肉之生產，同時推廣硏究皮毛，藥材，石油附產，及　　等工業原料之產製　運等方法，他如造紙，造糖，水電，製造肥料，農具製造等工業亦應分別緩急，次第進行·（文俠）</p>

<h3>台省首屆敎育會議　羅致全省中敎專家　研討質的改善充實</h3>
<p>〔本報台中廿日電〕檢討兩年來施敎的得失，作爲未來改進標準的台省首屆敎育行政會議，在台巾文化城揭幕。主持者至少存有希望這個會作爲全國示範的作用的。</p>
<p>朱部長家驊，以各級敎育配合爲主題，向出席二百多的會員作一臨別贈言」，他感謝欽佩於兩年來爲改變台灣敎育的方式，精神而工作羨的敎育工作者。他提及日本在台灣時期所施展的敎育說：日人採取的壓榨，奴役底敎育，像這樣貽害國人的敎育，固須快刀斬亂麻的去掉，但有用的我們仍須保留，配合，發揚光大。日人半世紀在安定中求得規模，具有基礎之點，是不可以抹煞的。他最後希望本省的各級敎育配合起來，使國家得其用，社會受其利。</p>
<p>朱氏叙述五日來在台省之印象，他說，在內地喊了十多年新生活運動，排隊買票上車的習慣沒有弄好，而台胞則早具有這種習慣，他說內地各種不合理的現象，都是不安定之故，而要改正的。</p>
<p>楊監察使亮功，則大聲地呼喊着，敎育不是造就做官，要造就與工礦生產事業配合的專家！技術人員！</p>
<p>敎育會議羅致了全省中等學校以上的校長，和來賓及專家，他們來自全省各地，其中五分之四是內地人，朱部長更希望他們以台灣的敎育和內地作一比較，求改進。會議中有提案四十五件，其中多數是經費和行政問題。</p>
<p>經費，待遇，生活，在台灣一樣需要急於解決！</p>
<p>目前台灣有國立大學一，省立學院三，省立中等學校六十八，縣立中學一三二，加入私立中學校，共二一六所。全省敎負：專科以上二百四十人，省中敎一千九百零六人，國民學校敎單一萬五千七百六十三人。學生：專科以上一千三百七十五人，中學五萬九千六百零五人，小學生八十四萬三千人。</p>
<p>的方面已發展得相當階段，祗有待於質的改善充實。在質上也確實需要改善！因爲目前量的發展，非但不能掩飾質的貧乏，却顯得具有危機！</p>
<p>一般都確信首屆敎育會議，只不渦集全省敎育工作者於一堂的集會，不會有好效果，或許以所費充實設備和饑器，比較的更有成效，更實際；但敎育常局却寄予期待的，因爲這畢竟是兩年餘來首屆會議。</p>
<p>台中是全省最靜謐美麗的文化都市，日來正是風和日麗，一如初春。繼全省運動大會之後，又在這裏召開三天的敎育會議，並陳列各單位的展覽品，合中是光榮的。（本報特派員暮雲寄）</p>

<h3>昨晚籃球聯賽　青白長力不濟受挫於恩卡斯　仁餘大勝美憲兵春茂力戰克億中</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕籃球聯賽，昨晚三塲，市體育館觀衆雖不擁擠，然三塲比賽，過程均相當緊張。甲組靑白以後勁不濟，長力不足，三十五比四十七敗於恩卡斯，深爲可惜，上半時靑白尚以二十二比十九，領前三分。首塲甲二Ｂ，億中一路領先，上半時十九比十七多二分，然結果爲四三比三十二，億中敗於春茂。次幕甲一組，仁餘大勝美憲兵，實力懸殊一面倒局勢，上半時三十九比十四，結果七十二比三十四，仁餘大勝</p>
<p>春茂反勝億中</p>
<p>甲二B春茂以四十三比三十三勝億中，上半時二十六比十四，雙方均人材濟濟，春茂以何金貴黃天烈得分最多。</p>
<p>仁餘克美憲兵</p>
<p>甲一仁餘大勝美憲兵，吳新運姚文　王槐庭等，對方目爲危險人物，美憲兵　氏亦身手靈活，堪稱庸中佼佼，上半時三十九比十四，下半時形勢趨於平均，爲三十三比二十，結果七十二比三十四。</p>
<p>恩卡斯敗靑白</p>
<p>恩卡斯上場施威，連中兩球，青白諸將　起，拼成各七平手。周達雲空心球一中再中，頓以十五比十一超出。恩隊暫停，二十比十七時，恩隊健將格朋乞谷夫眼镜打碎離場，上半時二十二比十九，靑白領前三分。</p>
<p>下半時詔寶堃與張少卿會有極佳傳球，出其不意，但恩卡斯硬攻可畏，猛追不已，迨Ｖ開羅斯基中籃時，二十六比二十七，反以一分超越。馬漢更增一球，少卿擲中，徐亭罰入，三十平手形勢吃緊。恩卡斯命運較佳，一連得中數球，青白大受打撀，雖經調動陣綫，依然無效，四十七比三十五，青白差十二分敗北。</p>

<h3>華同金鈔黑市仍盛　僑匯收入日見减少　最低外匯調整後僑匯毫無增加</h3>
<p>據中國銀行國外部負責人談稱，新年以來，僑匯收入益見减少，上星期內，該行所收入之僑匯，僅五千一百餘美金，及三百二十餘英鎊，較去年年尾更少。上海之業鈔黑市，自經金融管理局二次破壞其經售之秘密機構後，美鈔黑市價格，已見絕跡，但目前僑匯黑市改以廣州黑市之便利核稅爲根據，廣州金鈔黑市，仍極猖獗，若廣州之金鈔黑市，亦能予以迎頭打擊，則僑匯可能逐漸增加。至僑匯與外匯市價之關係，根本均已脫節，過去外匯匯率每調整一次，僑匯尚能增加少許，此次外匯調整至十二萬三千五百元，僑匯毫無增加。在外匯黑市仍然猖獗聲中，僑匯收入之前途實未可樂觀云。</p>
<h3>廣帮不時傾售　華股終被迫低</h3>
<p>華股昨廣帮不時傾售，人心屢遭阻遏，漲風雖有掀動，仍被迫低。交易少，浮空多，但銀根終助實氣，大勢仍屬盤　。晨開趨昂，永紗以七三五元及七五二元之價開市，旋即升至七三八元及七五八元高價，脫手者多，又回跌至七二〇元及七三九元。塲外息價開三角三及三角七分半，再跌至七〇八元及七二一元低價，十一時後轉穩，回風一起，步昂不已，近午漲到七四六元及七七一元高價，而後以七四五元及七七〇元收市。較前收即交股計新華閘北美亞回升半成，中泥跌半成，商務尚平，餘均微升。遞交股勤興獨平，美亞升一成，餘均徵升。</p>
<p>後市開出雖高，自七六二元及七七六元起，經廣帮二〇二號一賣，立告下游。國行差進不少，銀根恐慌又起，跌至七三八元及七四四元。雖外喊高三十餘元，塲內亦進至七五〇元及七六〇元外，但終被迫低至七三五元及七四二元收市。結果較晨收即交股新華美亞信誼跌半成，中絲低一成弱，中紡中泥尚平，永紗閘北華新信和統益商務華豐火些新光麗安景福勤興內衣中法微降，餘均小升。遞交股信和景福跌半成，餘均微挫、塲外各未上市股票，均無特變。</p>
<h3>統債轉疲　外股平穩</h3>
<p>公債昨不支而疲，祇統戊稍升，成交五百萬元。統丙晨開八萬元，低價七萬七，高價八萬二，而後轉定。較前收計甲乙低二千元，丙丁尚平，戊種則升一千元。外股昨熱股頗有彈性，冷股則告軋低。洋商賣出，證券帮錢兌業均進。怡紗晨開五二萬，低價五〇萬，高價五八萬左右，而後略盤低至五五萬結束。結果較前收計紙版漲一成，業廣升半成，懇植軋低一成，怡啤鋼業均平，餘股榮辱俱微。</p>
<h3>人造絲略升　綢貨市况堅穩</h3>
<p>人造絲昨市被疲後堅，結果微升二百萬元弱。一二〇號旭字有光，開盤價只九千萬元，供求甚平，迄中午升至一百五十萬收元盤，下午再告堅升，最後賣出價爲二百五十萬元，東洋及天橋等均隨之而高、</p>
<p>廠經昨市平穩，交易仍稀，只有零擔交易，高零擔在四百萬元左右，中級零擔在二百萬元左右。老虎灶絲在九千萬元關內，各級五擔頭及干經均乏成交，喊價並無變化。</p>
<p>綢貨昨市堅穩，眞絲被面　升二十萬元，華强貨開市一百二十萬元有成交，買興甚濃，傾刻間哄至五十萬元即期價。旋因多方獲利吐售，漸呈疲落，收市降至一百二十萬元即期價，隔日期微五十五萬至六十萬元，其他各貨，均呈堅定。</p>
<h3>棉花商同業公會　會議中止舉行</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕本市棉花商業同業公會，本定昨下午二時，舉行小組會議，商討紗管會委託購棉合同事。旋以紗管會合同，迄未送到，故會議中止舉行，旋四時卅分許，該會理事長劉屏蓀，曾由紗管會採運處副處長朱蘇吾約見，聞對合同之擬訂，曾交換意見，今日可望將合同送到棉商公會，繼續提付商討云。</p>
<p>收棉統計</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕據悉：中國紡建公司自去年九月起，迄目前止，業已收購進倉之新棉，共達六五二，九七六市担。各地存棉總額，迄共達一，〇〇九，四四九市担云。</p>
<p>印棉到埠</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕大英公司澳若陀號，昨日自孟買抵滬，運來棉花三萬件，現泊公和祥碼頭起卸。</p>
<h3>棉紗複製業登記　廠商共千戶</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕紗管會連日起趕辦本市複製業登記，截至昨（廿日）爲止，機器染織·毛巾被單·織帶·手工棉織·針織·毛紡織·紡綫·等十一單位，已送登記表格，約爲六千戶。紗商存商申請登記者約三千戶以上。廠商合計約爲九千戶。又襯衫製造業申請登記，已經該會核准，正辦理登記中。所有登記廠商表格，該會在加緊審核中。</p>
<h3>棉紗布價均盤低　四支藍鳳比上日續見低跌</h3>
<p>昨日棉紗市况，晨開市氣依然萎蘼，客帮納意甚懈，本街同業亦鮮採納，喊價盤低。四十二支藍鳳細紗曾小見五千六百八十萬元，嗣以銀根略鬆，莠戶拉提，複製廠見小收吸。迨至收市，回升至五千七百八十萬元，終比上日績跌七十萬元。其餘各支粗細紗，亦均步降一·二十萬至一百七·八十萬元不等，惟二十一支雙馬，及廿支金城，去化較多，價獨告軋升一·二十萬元。</p>
<p>昨日棉布市面，初開似見堅俏，旋因隔夜浮多了吐，行情疲挫。至十時許，揚子公司代客帮收進元嗶嘰三四件之譜，同時長江帮客人亦有少數吸納，市氣復告回振。近午因紡建公司照例開市，業中以晨歷年關日近，走銷漸走錯清淡，進意甚懈，而塲內祇見套買交易，價盤再告軋低。迨至午收，十二磅各檔細布大都平疲，嗶嘰直貢及漂布較秀，色布及士林布市仍堅穩，其他粗布斜紋等，絕少精彩。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕中國紡建公司昨循例售布，共售四五〇〇疋，申購單一〇六張，內廠商三張，購布三六〇疋外，餘悉屬布號所購。</p>
<p>現棉稍堅</p>
<p>昨日現棉市况疲中帶堅，同業銀根稍寬，微有吸胃，人心轉穩。更以花紗布統購統配原則下，棉商仍有出路，故執貨者尚不願　行急售。同時紡建收購，開價已稍高，因之趨勢不弱。今日成交四九五包，送廠價做開漢細五二九萬一千，成交二三四包。棧交價做開漢細五一六萬七千，靈實五八八萬六千，六〇三萬五千，成交二六一包，周浦籽花一一三萬五千</p>
<h3>紅綠茶喊價高</h3>
<p>紅綠茶，自產存趨縮後，執貨者居奇扳售之念，莫不倍於往昔，喊價迭向前進。惟外銷花色，出口商畏高，態度咸取觀望，是以過程僅能靜中帶俏，至於內銷茶，因本街與客帮各有去化，買戶已不顧高價，續吸甚勁，情勢遂告猛晋，脚地亦頗穩固。</p>
<p>糖市初疲後回　青赤糖依然疲跌</p>
<p>昨糖市初疲後回，結果白糖比前日升五六萬元不一，青赤糖依然疲跌。公會劃盤現貨二四粗白為一百七十六萬元至七十二萬元，四半白為一百六十九萬元至七十一二萬元，草包一百六十六萬元，二〇中砂白為二百七十三萬元至六十九萬元，台赤二百十萬元，號貨汕提青一百五十五萬元至五十二萬元，小六七萬元，汕赤一百六十二萬元，興化白袋裝高化一百六十七萬元至七十一萬元，升一二萬元，興赤一百五十七萬元至六十萬元，小五六萬元，刁青一百四十五萬元，小十餘萬元，海南赤一百五十五元至六十萬元，小五萬元，新順德青一百五十萬元。期貨棧單二四粗白，明日交割，有七八萬上落。下午照加，為十二萬五千元，升六七萬元。四半白週四期，和為三萬五千元，曾步升至十一二萬元，後為八萬五千元，升六七萬元。</p>
<h3>上月麵粉轉口額　糧部核增二萬袋</h3>
<p>東北烟青地區亦令准開放</p>
<p>十二月份麵粉轉口限額，報運分配數量，四區麵粉公會，業已分配就緒，適又奉糧食部電知，增加轉口限額二萬袋，共四十二萬袋。</p>
<p>該項麵粉，因啓運限期迫切，尤以陰　在　，各審核委員，散居各主，召集需時，為簡化手續起見，按各廠十一月份實際總產量一，四三七，四七〇袋，（五大廠不包括在內，除以總限額內二十萬袋，歸該五廠自行分配外。其餘按四六廠以8.348%比例分配，其問運銷天津半數，已專案申請，毋庸再行塡報外，其餘運銷各地（除台灣外），均限於一月二十五日前送會轉部，逾期决不補報。</p>
<p>又東北禁止轉口，茲奉令開放，各廠均可報運。</p>
<p>木材疲輭</p>
<p>昨木材市况，洋松因到貨尚有，且受銀根奇緊影響，市氣仍疲，現各檔木材均見疲軟</p>
<h3>四聯對於生產貸款　擬採定貨押匯方式</h3>
<p>四聯總處為今後貸款問題，已函各行局迅速草擬方針及業務計劃，關於本年度生產貸款，凡屬民生日用必需品，將採定貨方式，運銷將採押匯方式，俾與定貨貸款相配合。茲將該處所擬之民生日用必需品定貨貸款綱要摘錄如下：（一）為配合合國策，增加生產，並協助政府掌握物資，穩定物價起見，除依照原訂方針，核辦生產貸款外，對民生日用必需呂生產事業，特採用定貨貸款方式，予以協助。（二）辦理定貨貸款之對象及實施地點，參照實際需要，分案規定之。凡憶由四聯總處核定專案貸助辦法，或已由政府規定統籌管制辦法者，應與原規定辦法配合辦理。（三）凡適合辦理定貨貸款之生產事業，由主管機關向四聯總處申請核轉各國家行局，分別就專業範圍內，單獨或聯合承辦定貨貸款業務。（四）辦理定貨貸款之方式，規定（一）貸款數額，視各業週轉性質及生產成本核定之，（二）貸款期限，視各業之生產過程，核實訂定，（三）定貨貸款到期時，即以所產成品，按原訂合約所規定之各數量交貨清償，（四）定貨價格，應保障各業之合法利益，（五）定貨貸款所需資金，由中央銀行墊撥，（六）定貨貸款業務所得之物資，應售給政府主管機關，統籌處理，（七）承受定貨貸款各業之工作進度，開支成本，原料·品質·及製造技術等，應隨時攷核，並得派員隨時稽核之。（八）本貸款合約格式及實施細則，另訂之。（九）凡經核定辦理定貨貸款之生產事業，以運銷需資，各行局得以押匯方式配合貸助，但不得另以押款及貼現方式貸予資金。本綱要經四聯總處理事會核定施行云。</p>
<h3>食米去化呆滯　油市起伏狹隘</h3>
<p>昨日南北兩市共到米糧二萬零三百餘石，到源湧旺，店胃清懈，市化呆滯，續見低落，粳米早薄稻步削萬餘元，無錫白粳退入一百四十大關，秈米隨之軟化。白元陰元依然提高殺低甚列。</p>
<p>麵粉略有參差，廠粉存貨不多，挺升二三千元，雜牌及內地客粉源源到申，暫無波動。麩皮鄉銷轉呆，再入疲途，挫落六七千元，形成兔起鵲落。</p>
<p>豆餅閩胃清懈，挫跌五六千至抵申，人心不振，挫跌五六千至萬元。黃豆銷路呆木，續跌二三萬元。菉豆北方去胃不多，萎靡不振。赤豆交淡少神。蠶豆另化不强，疲中徘徊。豇豆成交寥寥，回跌萬元。</p>
<p>紅糧去化閒散，脩削萬餘元。苞米北洋納胃清懈，猛跌三四萬元。芝蔴供求兩少，亦難生色。生仁廣胃不爽，本街不前，步跌五六萬元。</p>
<p>油市起伏狹隘，豆油廠方供源充沛，回小二三萬元。菜油亦疲二三萬元，清油去路甚細，挫跌三五萬元。生油交易活絡，堅挺之絡，蔴油過於供，由疲轉挺，回高三五萬元。</p>
<h3>無證到埠染料　規定加成辦法</h3>
<p>處理無證上自備外匯到埠物品審議會，廿日下午在中信局開第十八次會議，討論對染料照起岸價格如何加成配售事宜。結果决定：（一）錠藍分三種，計百分之廿五，百分之六十七，及百分之一百五十。（二）人造錠為分三種，計百分之二十，百分之一百，及百分之一百八十。（三）硫化元分三種，計百分之二十，百分之二百，及百分之五百云。</p>
<p>又悉：本週四之會議停開，本週六會議將對西藥及化學原料之加成，加以討論云。</p>
<h3>捲菸燭皂均疲</h3>
<p>昨日捲菸市况，初開交易閒散，旋以實銷尚佳，同業抵補甚殷，行情見昂。詎至近收，頤中公司開派大南未三砲台前門等烟，同業頭寸又告軋緊，乘高轉賣甚夥，價又趨疲。結果除三星全祿，因逢低有吸，稍見軋升，十支大英老刀續挫十萬至五萬元，其餘中外各烟則均步降。</p>
<p>日用品肥皂市面，以黃祥茂將辦理派貨，每箱配價為一百十萬元，買戶遜色，結果固本皂回小五千元，箭刀步挫一萬元，祥茂獨跌二萬元，牛牌美麗等皂則升一萬，火柴銷淡，軋落十左右。</p>
<p>火油市氣仍見挺秀，同業互做高度桶貨七百二·三十萬元，美孚聽裝八十四萬元，洋燭站定。</p>
<h3>外匯提高後　出口業好轉</h3>
<p>自外匯提高百分之二十七後，出口業方面，已見好轉。近日出口最多者為皮毛，歐洲各國日前均甚需皮毛，且值皮毛銷售旺季，故銷路增加。其他如桐油·豬鬃·茶葉·蛋類·因國內外價格相差仍多，故雖有銷路，但出口數字並不多。至出口押匯方面，中國銀行等並未因國家行局之貸款停止而同時停止，目前出口商仍可請做押匯，以作週轉之資金。惟該項押匯，僅以三十日為限，在限期以內，必需歸還云。</p>
<h3>柴爿到希價貴</h3>
<p>時值隆冬，天氣嚴寒，煤斤因來源不繼上漲，柴爿亦以溫州等地到貨稀少，本街門莊去胃甚健，現貨供不應求，行情奇俏。栗柴上週間每擔十三萬五千，昨喊價漲至十四五萬。雜柴十二·三萬，松柴十一·二萬，乾燥售十五萬之譜，約昂一成有餘。</p>

<h3>志摩雜記（一）</h3>
<p>— 徐志摩遺著　陳從周輯</p>
<p>志摩雜記數則，是詩人徐志摩遊學新大陸與英倫時的作品，都是信手寫來，隨記隨　的文章；有些類似日記，有些類似雜感，寫得非常零亂，頗費爬梳。　珊主　囑為輯錄，現在特地將牠排比起來，姑名其曰「志摩雜記」。這些零錦碎王中，依稀可以想像到徐氏當年的氣概風度，引起讀者無限的回憶。卅七年一月十五日陳從周記</p>
<p>十月十五日起，同居四人一隨遵守協定章程，大目如六時起身，七時朝會（激恥發心），晚　國歌，十時半歸寢，日間勸學　外，運動散步閱報。</p>
<p>雄心已蓬勃，懶骨尙支離；日者晚間入寢將十一時，早六時起身，畏冷，口膩，必　洗後始神氣清爽，每餐後輒遲凝欲睡，在圖書館中過於溫暖，尤令懶氣外洩，睡魔內侵；惟晚上讀書最為　意，亦二十年來習慣之果。生平病一懶字。母親無日不以為　，幾乎把一生懶了過去，從今打起精神，以殺懶虫，滅懶氣為第一椿要事。</p>
<p>因懶而散漫，美其稱曰落拓，余父母皆勤而能勵，兒子何以　散若是，豈查桐蓀先生之遺敎　！志摩目是血性大，奈何幼時友　人，遂不聞絲毫激刺語；長　　社會之　　，養成一種惡觀　，惡習氣，散漫無紀至於如此。從今起事事從秩序着手，頭頭是道，再要亂七八糟，難了難了。</p>
<p>可憐志摩失其性靈者二十餘　矣！天不忍志摩以　闊終其身也，幸得騰翻北遊，　羽青　，　視下界，乃知所目從來者，其　　醜陋鄙塞齷齪，安足如是！反顧我身則猶是黑　醜陋鄙塞齷齪之團體中之分子耳。其所有之特質未嘗或缺，平日同在鮑魚肆中，故習於臭，今忽到芝蘭世界，始自慚形穢（以人性本善也）陋，嗣其鄙塞，洗其齷齪，朝夕兢兢焉，而猶　不逮知矣，而行未從也；立矣而未能前也。即使於此能行矣前矣，而難保他日之投身昔所從來之社會，雖有　剝　洗之心，而物欲腐於外，根性（惡根性）突於　，其不喪元常者幾希焉！望磨剝　洗之功也乎？摩以是戰　咒想，戴髪　股勿能自己也。</p>
<p>日者思想之英銳透　，殆有生以來未嘗有也，無論在昔混濁之社會中未嘗思念及此，即自出海以來，至於距今十餘日前，其　預　塞，曾未嘗一見天日之光也，請言今日之所思。</p>
<p>梁先生之意大利三傑傳，而志摩血氣之勇始見。三傑之行狀固極壯快之致，而先生之文筆亦天矯若神龍之盤空，力可拔山，氣可蓋世，淋漓沉痛，固不獨志摩為之低昂慷慨，舉凡天下有血性人，無不騰攘激發有不能自己者矣！昔以為英雄者，資自天也，不可得而冀也；今以為英雄之所以異於人者，以其能持一往之氣，　迅直前而無所阻　也。孔子曰：「我欲仁斯仁至矣」！至於自貶其志氣拘子庸凡，斯其自求為庸凡。而不可得耳，况于非常哉。向使志摩能持　三傑之意氣，而　迅直前也：則瑪志尼志摩也，加里保的志摩也，加富　志摩也。惟其勢有所外壓而氣有所中衰，則九　之功或虧一　。夫千古　仰事變，懷彼三傑之意氣者，不知其幾千萬也！彼其不成者，氣有所衰而意有所奪也</p>
<p>志摩意氣方新，桓桓如出柵之虎，以為天下事不足治也。雖然此浮氣也，請循其本，志摩以為千古英雄聖賢之能竟治其業也，必有所藉。所藉者何？才乎，學乎，運乎，皆其旁支而非正幹也。正幹者何？至誠而已矣。天之能化，地之能造，無他，亦至誠而已矣。夫至誠然後幾干神之所運金石穿焉；故身然後能成，志摩不　，請致其誠。誠者本也。本立而道生，本之不立，則其　其識皆如陸子所謂藉寇兵　盜糧者也。故　于此滄海　流之日而　揭致良知之說，以為萬物先。世有君子，其予諒乎？（待續）</p>
<h3>小說技術談</h3>
<p>— 逸</p>
<p>心理的描寫</p>
<p>心理描寫為作者自己在故事中「漏臉」的一種原因，而心理描寫，除非極簡單的故事，又是必不可少的。</p>
<p>小說以敘述情節，描寫人物為主。但　還不夠，讀者更要知道書中人物在想些什麽，對於他們的遭遇，作何反應，心中有無矛盾的地方，言行的動機何在。把這種思想上的過程，逐一寫下，在小說中稱為心理描寫。這心理兩字，與科學家所謂心理，略有不同的地方。小說中所謂心理描寫，乃指主觀的經歷而言。</p>
<p>描寫心理上的經歷，自十九世紀中葉以來，盛行一時，到詹母士（Henry　James）還是如此。曲華之（Joyce）吳爾富（Virginia　Woolf）兩人，都較詹母士更側重心理描寫，有時竟置布局於不顧。但心理描寫中有幾種方法為詹母士所不用，即曲華之派亦不多用，心理分析，即其一也。</p>
<p>心理分析者，小說家解釋人物行為的動機，尤其在動機不甚顯著的時候。此法不始於十九世紀，在十八世紀時已有之，費爾鈍便是其中一人。他把小說當作哲學論文，寫人物　感想與心境，全不「戲劇化」，而只諷刺似地討論着他們。他用「概論化」的方法來討論人物的心理，以求適合其道德標準。這種哲學式的論調，可說是費爾鈍的特長。</p>
<p>伊　德·梅理迪的小說，都含有哲學意味。心理分析，常妨碍了故事的進展，甚不自然，比費爾鈍更來得討厭。費爾鈍有時還簡單明顯地在敘述行動，而伊麗德竟常出乎表面動機之外，討論到意識深處，很近於佛洛特（Freudian）的下意識論調，梅理迪及白杜路（Butler）都有此趨向。白杜路的論調，未免帶有十八世紀氣息，枯燥無味。本來維多利亞時代的小說，大都理智與感情並重。伊麗德的心理描寫，有時也不很錯，其所以討人厭者，她自己要上塲「漏臉」，月旦人物。她對於讀者，有似敎師一般，口講指劃，在那裏訓誨，　　；而對於人物，又如「母雞將雛」，只怕他們鬧出岔子來。</p>
<p>梅理迪的心理描寫，與伊麗德的又略有不同。伊麗德好寫自私自利之心，而梅　迪　寫　則較為複　，乃一　主　　道德　榮心。梅理迪的　　比費爾鈍和伊麗德來得多，很有特點，有時也近於　劇化，但　　意味，敎訓口吻，卻更比他們顯著。小說至此，與歷史哲學無甚區別，像做　　一般，去分析人物　感情，建立他的人性哲學。嚴格　說，梅理迪簡直不是一位小說家。所謂小說家，本　確定範圍，翔梅理迪這樣一位人才，又未　　諸小說家之外，看他的小說，也不能說是無益，然而技術是另一問題，只　得他抽象的閑話太多具體的描寫太少，不給我們想像的餘地。他的人物，從不曾有過插嘴的機會。此外還有一個大毛病是雜。爲什麽說他雜呢？譬如分析心理，寫來確有點戲劇化了可是一而他正讓書中人物自己來表演，一面他又插了進來說幾句話，便　得非常的不調和，不調和也罷了，他又自己常在打自己的嘴巴，其所以略勝於伊麗德者，則因寫來尙戲劇化耳。</p>
<p>法國作家，也好分析情感，像卜羅士（MarcelProust）便是一例。卜羅士的回憶錄（AlaRecherche　du　temps　perdu）是部名著，因為不是小說，所以不妨跑野馬，東談談，西說說，看去便不像梅理迪的作品那樣的不順眼。法國作家還有一點與英國作家不同的地方。法國作家多持宿命論，而英國作家則持自由意志論。敎訓的話，到處皆是。此又是卜羅士的　略佔便宜的地方。</p>

<h3>評話小識</h3>
<p>— 戴不凡</p>
<p>雙漸和蘇　的故事</p>
<p>雙漸和蘇　的故事，在宋　　時　　　張　，　　　故事一般膾炙人口，　　戲曲和小說　的引　可以　　　來。不　道　故事年久　　，我　已　　　其　來　情節了。近來　有趙景　把這位「失落了的小姑娘」從許多書中　　　來，　我　能知道一點廬山真面目。「趙　見「小說戲曲新考」兩二　三——三〇八）但趙先　似乎遺漏了一點現成的資料，那也是「石　　」中的：——卷二「　夢仙江上尋妻」。「　夢仙江上尋妻」中雖然有「如馮商還妾故事」一　，但　夢仙　其　　　　　　經過，實際上，和蘇　嫁給馮生，蘇　去尋　　　，多少有相似之處。而且嗎，　　嫁的也是一位江西商人（鹽商）。而蘇　嫁　也是一位江西商人（茶商）至於蘇卿和　惠在金山寺所題的詩，也僅有數字之　　。現在把它不同之處比勘如下：（詩錄自趙書，括弧中的是「石點頭」上的。）</p>
<p>「憶昔（一自）當年折鳳凰，至今消息兩茫茫，蓋棺不作　金婦，入地當尋（還從）折桂郎。彭　　烟　（歸）　夢，　　夜雨斷　腸。新詩寫記（向）金山寺，高掛雲帆上（過）豫章。」</p>
<p>這當然不是偶然的巧合。水滸傳第五十回有白秀英說書：「魯　城　漸趕蘇卿」，說不定「石點頭」的作者天然痴叟是曾見過這回話本，而　新　名，改　以為已作的。</p>
<h3>冬晨散記</h3>
<p>— 陳履明</p>
<p>隔着眼皮，天朦朧地亮了。</p>
<p>昨日不快意的貼附在心上的陰影，尾隨在夜的黑流消失，新的希冀漾着燦爛的笑，踏在曙光里落在還是十分靜寂的地球上。</p>
<p>太陽開始給冬天帶來了可貴的溫暖，明朗的淡清的天際，一　白雲在冉冉的　　着，像一個披了白紗的修道女，在雲　的純潔里默默地向晨光祈禱。詩人們在美麗的詩章裏，常歡喜寄琦瑰的晚霞的，假使把落日時的天　，比做繁華而熱鬧的奏着醉人的爵士音樂的舞廳，那末讓我把晨曦里的長空，說成是一座莊嚴肅穆充滿光亮的聖所吧。在十字架前使犯罪者反省懺悔，使　武的野心者慢慢垂下頭來，而從良心深處開始讚頌安樂與和平。但是，這里是沒有一個偽善的傳敎者，祗有尖屋頂里的那口古銅鐘，在作一分鐘間息的，使人們空虛的心靈充實起來的鳴聲。</p>
<p>小鳥是清晨最活潑的歌手，即使是在這樣嚴冬的封閉裏，給她們顫抖的脆越的童聲，在人們的心底里喚回了春天，喚回了童年溪語里的夢景。對着這樣小巧的歌手，再望望這山之國里一匹匹呆笨光禿的大山，我感到非常滑稽地笑了。</p>
<p>枯草上，隱伏着昨夜偷偷地凝成了的嬌嫩的露珠，她們像玩皮的小孩般濡進人們的鞋底，或者憑着地勢灌飽了褲腳　維的肚子，胆大的就站在茅草花的頂端，對着朝陽作閃閃的媚笑，陽光就把她們變成了小得怕人看見的體質，帶到高空中，於是空氣里就混合着一種健康的泥土香。能夠在這氣息里長時操勞的人，就祗是為了營養他人終年辛勤的莊稼漢，讓我們祝福這些　質的生命吧，他們平安和快樂，全人類社會也就有福了。</p>
<p>對於愛與憎的訣　，我們當如何慎重呵！</p>
<p>經過清晨原野的洗滌，一個人的思慮就完全會淨化了。且讓我們的心靈，向自然開放而歌唱吧。</p>
<h3>最近的世界文壇</h3>
<p>— 趙景深</p>
<p>紀德的日記</p>
<p>法國紀德（Ancre　Gide）去年年底曾獲得諾貝爾文學獎金，現在他的早期日記已有英譯出版，可說是文壇上的一件可喜的事情。</p>
<p>紀德在二十歲的時候就開始寫日記；完全的法文本有一千三百　。美國版的第一卷是阿伯林（J．O　Brien）所翻譯的，從紀德開始文學工作起，一直到第一次世界大戰的邊　上，因此對於那一次戰爭很少敘述。</p>
<p>這一卷所敘的人物幾包括歐洲所有的大作家，如丹　　　，梅特林克，王爾德，羅丹，　加斯（Degas）等。背景則從巴黎到聖宅芒　雷（	St　Germain），羅馬，突尼斯和塞維爾。阿伯林在序言中說，紀德的早期日記主要的是講到他自己，他忠心於自己的考察和夢想，哲理的凝思和感情的無休止。</p>
<p>這日記的年代是從一八八九到一九〇六年。其中一九〇一到一九〇六年的部分是最使人感到興趣的，所謂自己的考察和哲理的凝思全都在這一段時間裏表現出來。紀德在一九〇四年寫到：「從一九〇一年十月二十五日我寫完「　反道德者」（L　Immoralite）以後，就不會　肅的工作過」。在這沉默期間，充滿日記的都是（可怕的失眠症），繼續的掙扎防止「思想的散裂」。</p>
<p>一年以後紀德在他鄉間住屋中寫道：「難道不能使我那可怕的跳動的心平靜下去麼？我像瘋人似的在沙漠上奔跑着」。紀德在青年時代所受的天主敎敎育的確是他成人時代危機的因素。他又說：「主呵，讓這個太狹隘的倫理爆發吧……」他所選擇的道路是不要榮譽的，嚴肅的文藝工作。「在我四周，我是創造沉默的人。」紀德雖是一個講道德的人，卻也公開地承認他自己的性衝動。他一方面相信他自己非常聖潔，一方面又說他自己非常腐敗。</p>
<p>總之，就是這感情的鬥爭，這個創傷，這個可怕的心的跳動，使得紀德成為藝術家，使得他逃避了斯坦達爾（Stendhal）的虛榮或福羅貝爾的易怒，又不像阿哈貢（Aragon），或沙爾德（Sartre）那樣的缺乏心理描寫，他在法國現代作家中是唯一屬於柏洛司特（Proust）一派的。</p>
<p>這本早期日記裏還敘到他個人的生活·例如，他曾受過宗教強迫敎育，他是被母親和姑母們養大的，他在諾曼第（Normandy）有兩所房屋，他有花園，他奏銅琴，甚至連他在家中用午餐這樣瑣細的事也寫在裏面。</p>
<h3>新詩人李勞禮</h3>
<p>在大戰期間，英國產生了許多小刊物，特別市在澳洲，其　康諾萊（Cyril　Connolly）的「地平綫」（Horizon）和李曼的「企鵝新作」（Penguin　New　Writing）是最著名的。李勞禮（Laurie　Lee）就在這兩種刊物上發表詩歌，至少還有兩種詩選採用了他的作品。「太陽我的紀念碑」（The　Sun　My　Monument）是他的第一本詩集。</p>
<p>他寫鄉村和戰爭都很當行。他的詩淺顯易懂，因為戰時的英國人不耐煩詩人的想像。</p>
<p>他不愧為浪漫主義者，帶一點感傷。他除了歌唱牧歌的調子和废墟的慨歎以外，還寫情詩。</p>
<p>他也常用比喻，這雖是在詩中極常見的，卻也每每容易寫得雜亂，但他卻能把不同的事物連接得很是和諧。</p>
<p>倘若李勞禮生在以前的時代，也許不妨僅僅做一個愉快的牧歌詩人，寫一些幻想的詩。無如他是活在現代這鬥爭的世界，所以他也時時感到時代的脈搏，他完全看出世界的不調諧，要想求一個解決之道。</p>

<p>自由談</p>
<h3>枯黃了的葉子</h3>
<p>— 靖文</p>
<p>偶在某報上看到轉載蘇聯「文學報」的一篇文章，題目是「葉十離開樹就枯黃了」·題目旣是這樣的寓於詩意，而又刋載於「文學報」，想必是一篇詩或文藝作品了。可是仔細一讀，却是一篇選道地地的政治宣傳文章，內容是批評法國的戴高樂將軍的，大意是說載高變將軍離開了人民，好比葉子離開了樹，就變得枯黃了。</p>
<p>這裏不想談戴高樂，因爲我對於政治舞台上的人物一向不感興趣。大概讀過一些歷史的人，都有這樣的同感，即是無論怎樣風雲叱咤不可一世的人物，就歷史的眼光看，也不過是森林中的一片枯葉而已。世事滄桑，過眼烟雲，今日認爲了不得的事，了不起的人，在歷史—應該說是時問—的無情輪子下，又誰能逃過枯葉的命運。</p>
<p>我的興趣，倒是在於「葉子離開樹就枯黃了」這個標題。這和「物必自腐而後蟲生」這句俗語有界曲同工之妙。無論寫文章或說話，引用比喩最難，因爲比喩的功用，是在以最簡明易解而又富有暗示作用的語句來表達出一個複雜的意念·一個好的比喩，必須具備常識性，亦即通俗性的基本條件。通俗的常識雖不一定就是眞理—有許多塲合且恰和眞理相反，但旣因是常識，就容易使人理解與接受。</p>
<p>例如像「葉子離開樹就枯黃了」或「物必自腐而後蟲生」等說法，若嚴格說起來，並不一定就是眞理。因爲葉子離開了樹固然會枯黃，物腐後也難免要生蟲，然而正確一些說，則實在是因爲葉子已枯黃或將枯黃才離開了樹，物生了蟲才會腐敗。但在常識觀念上，大家都不計較及此，因爲反正意思總是明白的。</p>
<p>可是常識的可怕處却正就在道種地方。你固不妨說常識是人生經騐的積聚，但你也可以說常識是人智進步的一個阻碍。因爲有許多常識雖包含憲一部份的眞理，惟多數所調常識，祗是引人走向不求甚解途上去的一服蒙汗藥而已。坊間有許多所謂「常識指南」，「常識問答」等一類書刊，大多就是這種東西。</p>
<p>現代國際間有所謂「神經戰」的一種戰術，以文字或圖畫所表達的宣傳，即是「神經戰」的一種。而且，據說宣傳也有技巧，其要點即在通俗而易解，使人容易發生印象，能使人發生印象，在宣傳「術語」上講就是達到了效果。因此深懂宣傳技巧的人，不僅自己應具備豐富的常識，且亦須懂得怎樣去利用他人的常識觀念。因爲理論與主義不是人人所能盡解，唯常識則可獲得人人視若當然的功效。</p>
<p>像「文學報」上的那篇文章，如果祗在正面敷說戴高樂將軍如何如何的不是，則無論說得怎樣的頭顯是這，合情合理，對於一般置身局外的人，是決不會留下甚麼印象的。但現在輕描淡寫的用了「葉子離開樹就枯黃」九個字，不僅標題的本身具有相當的吸引力，就以「宣傳效果」講，也毫無疑問的勝過一篇洋洋灑灑的政治理論。因爲對於一般不求甚解的人，單看了這樣的標題，也多少留下了一些印象。</p>
<p>不過話得說回來，能善用人們的常識觀念，雖可達到宣傳技巧上的目的，但這也使限於以常識爲眞理的一部份人而已，對於發揚眞理，啓迪人智，這種手段就不可取了，因爲其所利用的常識觀念，實不渦是利用了人類的弱點而已。等到日子久了，這種宣傳技巧的本身，也難免要像葉子一樣的枯黃的，到這個時候，人們的邏輯將不再是「葉子離了樹就枯黃」，而是桔黃了的葉子一定要離樹。</p>
<h3>貓的歸宿</h3>
<p>— 雷紅</p>
<p>山姆·高爾溫爲一部必片上的需要，要用一百五十頭貓。影片道具人接到了這個緊急通知，毫無辦法，後來他想起了城市裂的獸苑。</p>
<p>總算幸運，獸苑主人正好收集到大批人家不要而放生的貓。他就交出了一百五十頭。</p>
<p>道具人向公司當局黴　費用，每隻貓每天二元五角。但是有一天公司方面已經把戲拍好，不需用貓了。沒有人去收留這許多小家畜。獸苑主人把牠們領回去，而道具人爲他想出了一個出淸小貓的妙計。</p>
<p>明天報上刋出了一個廣告。上面說獸苑主人有一批「上過銀幕」的貓，　顯售價大金一元。</p>
<p>獸苑裏的每一隻小貓在一天之中都獲得了新的歸宿。</p>
<h3>雷諾的壯舉</h3>
<p>— 何苦</p>
<p>第二次大戰之後，美國至少出了一個奇人，這一個人便是雷諾。雷諾的球體筆尖鋼筆，以不用墨水的鋼筆爲號召，震驚了愛好新奇的美國人，因此使雷諾以球體筆尖起家。</p>
<p>但球體筆尖並不是雷諾的創造，他從異國人方面獲得了這個製造權，又推翻了別家鋼筆公司如犀飛利廠等的球體筆尖，打過官司，終於把這種鋼筆推銷到美國市塲。現在經銷於美國市塲上的球體筆尖鋼筆，雖然有好幾種牌子，當然以雷諾鋼筆公司的球體筆尖鋼筆爲老牌，不但是美國人手中都有了一枝，連歐洲亞洲諸國，都可以見到這種鋼筆。</p>
<p>其實球體筆尖鋼筆在制作上是新異的，在實用上說未必一定能打倒已有百餘年歷史的自來水筆·這在用過的人就有此經騐，理由不待說明，一比較便知，因此還有待於改善，這是雷諾公司在要打倒現在自來水筆的暢銷所必須考慮　點。</p>
<p>因此雷的不惜以鉅額經費，作爲他自己的球體筆尖鋼筆宣傳。他僱用飛行員乘了他自備的「雷諾炸彈號」，作環球飛行，藉以打破環球飛行的世界紀錄。所謂環球飛行，便是環繞經銷他的雷諾筆的城市作一巡行，籍以收宣傳之效。去年曾兩度來抵我國，「雷諾炸彈」號成爲我國報紙上的引人注目的新聞。</p>
<p>現在他又要來上海了，這一次不是環球飛行，而是到中國來探險，測量高山大川，又作另一種宣傳雷諾筆的方法。他在廣告方面之別出蹊經，用費浩大，實令人歎爲觀止。</p>
<p>但是雷諾的廣告術我承認比了他的雷諾筆更其成功！他的廣告具有積極性意義，如環球飛行之圖打破世界紀錄，探險飛行之深入蠻荒，都是手筆浩大的作爲，宣傳僅成爲目的之一種，造成他的雄偉的計劃，把雷諾的名字，使世界聞名，間接使新筆暢銷，才是他最後目的。他用特種貢獻的任務，爲今日以論爭，戰火瀰漫於全世界的大偉人們所不屑爲者，雷諾願以他的事業的盈餘來完成之，這是値得重視的。</p>
<p>我國不是沒有用其「取之於社會，還之於社會」的急公好義的事業家，但這是少數之又少數，以視雷諾的壯舉，不免又有天壞之別·大部份企業上獲得暴利的老板，無非極盡奢侈，裝點私人的享受而已，與雷諾較，其賢不肖又相去矣。</p>
<h3>美國貨的牌子</h3>
<p>— 道先</p>
<p>買東西的人喜歡講究牌子，造東西的人更是不惜花費龐大的廣告費來創造牌子，以求給購買者一個深刻　印象。</p>
<p>貨物的牌子，也就是所謂商標，總不外乎兩大原則，第一順口，容易念；第一簡單，容易記。有的人喜歡起拗口的，古怪的名字，但商標的取擇，却決不走此下策。</p>
<p>許多大家熟知的脾子，對於它們的典故，就不大淸楚了。</p>
<p>比如說香烟吧，勝利後首先來華傾銷的是「馬力斯」。它不　馬克斯，當然有其這理。原來有個烟草商，名呌菲力浦馬力斯，他在一八四七年自製香烟，賣給牛津大學　顧客們。不久，他又在劍橋大學附近設了一處分店。一處是馬力斯牛津，一處是馬力斯劍橋。後來給美國人收買，他們殊不喜拖一根牛津或劍橋的尾巴，就乾脆呌它爲菲力浦馬力斯。</p>
<p>還有一種薄荷烟，呌斯巴德（Spud），也是一個人名。此人一向自已捲香烟抽。某次稍感不適，醫師呌他吃點簿荷腦，他放了一點在烟葉中，覺得味選很好，就自製出售了。後來他把生財商標都賣給別的烟草公司了。</p>
<p>駱駝牌的名字是取其好念。至於那隻駱駝懺，是某馬戲班中的一隻呌做「老容易」的駱駝。</p>
<p>洗臉香皂，有一種棕　皂，和埃及尤物克麗奧帕特拉有關。因爲據說這位女王爲使皮膚美麗，每天用棕欖油洗面。該公司就將這段掌故大大地宣傳，棕欖皂也就名傳天下了。</p>
<p>北極冰箱（Norge）原名「極冷冰箱」，該公司老　在一九二六年時想換一個新商標，結果採用這個挪威字。它同時含有北方和寒冷的意思，頗合冰箱商標之用。但由於該公司常局深喜這個商標名字，迎他們後來出品的爐子，也用這個牌子了。</p>
<p>美國汽車的牌子，普通有兩種來源，一種是取自歷史名人，如林肯，Cadillac（法國貴族，後赴新大陸，創建德屈特州）等。還有一種是取自汽車製造業中的名人，如福特，別克，史杜培克（Studebaker）和克萊斯勒（Chrysler）等。</p>
<h3>美國捐稅重</h3>
<p>—</p>
<p>美國目前生活的高漲，政府開銷的龐大，也是主要原因之一。美國人民，現在一年中所付的稅，總額達五百億元美金·這雖然包括州稅和地方稅，但聯邦政府所徵取的佔四百億元以上。</p>
<p>據聯邦政府某機關的估計，一九四六年中，美國人所消耗的食物，約值三百九十億元。</p>
<p>這樣一比，就更見出美國政府開銷的浩大了。美國人民付給政府的管理費，比他們花在吃飯上的錢還要多。</p>
<p>總計美國人民全年的收入，有三分之一到四分之一，是流入捐稅的死巷中。杜魯門所提的本年度預算，比過去和平時期最高的預算，要高出四倍。</p>
<p>小小一隻麵包，到市上出售，早已付過好幾道稅了。種委的農人要付稅，代農人把麥子出售的中間商要付稅，磨麥成粉的　粉商要付稅，烘麵包的要付稅，賣麵包的雜貨商要付稅。一個主婦拿出來的買麵包的錢也是扣掉所得稅的刦餘。</p>
<h3>著書難</h3>
<p>— 津津</p>
<p>最近承某書局不棄，寫了一本關於經濟學入門之類的書，業已脫稿，在付排中。因此很讀了一些有關經濟，貨幣，銀行，經濟學史等的著作。偶然在一位經濟學前輩所寫的一本專著（此公的大名和書名，恕不舉出，因爲至目前止，他依舊是筆者最崇仰的一位學者）中記述貨幣的起源時，讀到一節云：「古希臘時曾以牛爲貨幣。荷莫之伊里亞特史劇第二十三章載某次武力競賽，勝者得一三脚鐵架，價値十二頭牛。負者得一婦人，枯價値四頭牛·」當時就覺得很奇怪，勝者得獎，固然在情理之中。負者却可得到一個婦人，從潛意識看來，多少是一件不壞的獎品，似頗令人費解。</p>
<p>隔了一些時，我在美國魯德格斯大學敎授友琴·亞格博士所著的一九四〇年版的貨幣與銀行第二十一頁上，亦讀到一節，所指的殆爲同一事實。原文譯成中文時，是這樣的：</p>
<p>「狄亞米突的手臂價値九牛，格勞格斯的手臂價値一百牛。在伊里亞特第二十三首詩篇中提起的角力者所得首獎三角架價値十二牛，女俘一名價値四頭牛。奴隸雖亦用牛計算，它却是一項比牛價値較高的（交易）單位。</p>
<p>這一節原文中標點分明，旣未將女俘列爲獎品的一種，更絕未提起是負者所得的獎賞。以前我發生的疑團，就渙然消釋了。</p>
<p>因此，我深覺著書的不易，一管在手，不禁戰戰兢兢，偶有筆誤，尚可原宥，倘使牛頭不對馬嘴，豈不貽笑大方。何况新學說層出不窮，昨日的眞知灼見，在今日儘有商榷餘地，例如我讀到貨幣數量學說，大意謂貨幣價　受貨幣數量（包括支票頭寸）流通　率及貨品供求數量等的支配，正覺得津津有味，言之成理，然而接着就讀到拉甫林諸氏的抨擊，以爲金銀幣自有金銀幣的價値，與流通數量等無關。近代學者的見解，亦謂政府開支，稅率高下，工資增减，心理向背，對於幣値的影響更大，遠在貨幣流通數量一端以上。頓時覺得在白紙上寫成黑字，欲成千古不易之論，正是憂憂乎其難了。</p>
<h3>傳奇人物</h3>
<p>— 寄漠</p>
<p>我們在若干情節曲折或好萊塢的電影中，往往可以看到許冬傳奇式的人物，不是身懷絕技，就是行事不同凡響，他們或者担任機密的工作，出生八死，或者胆大心細，臨難不茍，卒能化險爲夷，他們不僅是我們心目中的英雄，同時我們注視故事的發展，看到他們施展身手，大有作爲時，不禁爲他們浮一大白。我的一位朋友，統稱這些人物爲「獷悍的傢伙」（Toughguys），未嘗不是有所感而發的。</p>
<p>不過，筆者在實際生活中，跟這些具有「傳奇性」人物發生接觸時，似乎極少小說中的那種誇大氣氛。舍親某君，曾在敵僞時期，担任地下悄報工作，某次爲日軍破獲，某君穿短衣自後門遁出，僅以身免，他的同事，不幸均遭日軍槍決。某君痛定思痛尚有餘悸，雖然他以機警著稱，却是一個心臟病患者，他在緊要關頭，能够鎭靜自處，然而在穿馬路時，聽到汽車的喇叭聲，就要心跳！</p>
<p>又有某乙，一度在抗戰期間，在日軍後方作游擊戰，能够雙手發槍，十有九中，歷在前綫與日軍發生正面接觸，手刃日軍多人。戰後退伍，重度莊稼人的生活，看着他黝黑的皮膚，太訥的儀表，穿了一件靑布大掛，誰知道他的行徑，可以與「英雄們」</p>
<h3>禁酒</h3>
<p>— 平公</p>
<p>據中央社澎湖十八日電，澎湖人民嗜酒成癖，漁民因醉而喪身魚腹者常有所聞，縣府因決議週二及週五强制禁止，其他各日飲酒亦限自下午五時至十時止。據云，實行後可每日節省酒資五百餘萬元（台幣）。</p>
<p>我雖不是澎湖漁父，然而却也很有嗜酒成癖之勢。前講飲水氏（Drinkwater）作「林肯」劇本，寫林肯太太痛恨別人吸烟，每遇犯者，輒致呵責，當時我就暗想林太太未免太不留人餘地；但默察近來的情形，却見中外淸敎徒們方向一變，又在向禁酒的一條路上走去。電影一失去獻週末」所表現的酒徒，在飲酒同志固知其完全是誇張（而且中國人飲酒也從沒有這樣渾頭渾腦的），而不飲酒的人見之，自然難怪要觸目驚心，視爲魔鬼。今日讀到澎湖縣府禁令，甚有桴鼔相應之感—而且同樣的有些滑稽。</p>
<p>我說，酒是千萬不能「禁」的。爲甚麼呢？因爲，一「禁」之後，你的「癖」就反而愈來俞深，而且一發不可收拾。每一個好酒之徒都有過這樣的經騐：愈是別人不許你喝，你愈想喝。反之，如果你的量不過一斤，而別人每餐給你兩斤三斤時，你第一頓固會欣然喝一斤半，而舌麻心煩（若壞酒則再加上頭痛目昏），第二頓就是勉强喝了也是「食而不知其味」，到明天便必須稍休，至多每頓祇喝半斤了。但若你能喝一斤，而皇皇禁令，祗許你喝半斤，那麼這半斤下肚之後，其「酒渴」之利害，簡直使你無法自制，冬夜冒大雪去叩酒店的門，就在這種時候，此理蓋與「齋僧不飽，不如活埋」相同。</p>
<p>所以，假使我是澎湖一漁民，那麼澎湖縣府這個禁酒辦法實施之後，最想喝酒的時候必然就是星期二和星期五兩天，而且如果有「機會」喝的時候，定必比平時喝得更多。記得上海在淪陷時期，敵僞當局也禁止中午飮酒，結果是大家到了菜館裏用茶壺茶杯盛酒，經此偽裝，便大家心安理得了—而至今在我記憶中最深的一點，却是在那時酒喝得比平時特別多，而事實上酒味往往不佳，因爲菜館裏給你喝已是你的面子，你實在也不能再加挑剔</p>
<p>故禁酒令下，偷喝者必多　惟其是「偷」喝，故喝得匆忙，喝得草率，喝得隨便，因之也就　喪了身體。須知十個吃酒的人中，本來總有一二個還是懂一點酒趣的，等到一頒禁令，則十僩酒徒就是十個酒徒，那時候的飲酒才真的成爲痢疾</p>
<h3>逍遙花</h3>
<p>— 陳慎言</p>
<p>第八章　功敗垂成（四八）</p>
<p>雲卿道：「他不能答應也好，從此以後，不許他再生異心！」鳳笙嘆口氣道：「你說的都不錯，人可以管·人心是管不了的，我早就知道，齋會生異心，祗想不到他會變得道麼快！我想這條件不妨提出，至於俗呌我找對象，呌我再嫁別人，這一輩子不會有的。」說着又流下淚來。雲卿看了，心裏也有些難過·後來一想，這是一個機會，我不能爲了一點不忍人的心，放手不幹，並且替她出這種主意，很可伸縮操縱，事情能順利，利益決不讓人，事情若有周折，鳳笙的權利仍然存在，渚齋心意旣已變更，我爲安慰他情緒，也不能破壞他;縱使破壞，也未必能成功，並且徒添糾紛，不能安慰渚齋，連鳳笙也徒增加她的苦惱，又於事何益。雲卿在這一剎那間，腦筋轉動，便下了決心說道：「這是你存心忠厚多情處，祗怕渚齋不能像你這樣眞情眞意吧？」鳳笙道：「他對我當然沒有情意，果有情意，何至出　舉動。一錯百錯，就是我母親爲顧面子，把我嫁他嫁錯了，現在也不須追悔，祗有這一條路可走，若是等他發動，我更無立足之地了！」雲卿道：「不，我今天得到這消息，氣忿不過，才來告訴你，我所出主意，也許不妥，你再考慮考慮！」鳳笙道「沒有什麼考慮的，我就這樣辦。」雲鄉道：「我希望你考慮考慮！」鳳笙道：「你的主意，與我大有利益，舍此之外，我也想不出其他好法子。」雲卿道：「那末，你也得察看情形，不要見面就衝突起來。」鳳笙道：「我們那一天不衝突呢！這個你不必顧慮，我早看透了，我們兩口子，非閙過一塲大風波，不會和好的。」雲卿聽聽這話，不由心裏一動，這話大有見解，其中大有文章，不要利用她不成，反爲她所利用，弄得兩方面都落空，鄉才不値呢。雲卿這種觀念，祇在腦中稍一萌芽，一瞥就過去，當下祗點點顯道：「我希望你一切謹愼，別因爲我多嘴，弄出一塲是非。」鳳笙道：「我和渚齋離婚，終久不能避免，祇要所提條件他能一一答應，便是我的勝利，萬一其中有發生什麼周折，我希望你再帮忙，再替我出個好主意。」雲鄉連述應道：「是的，是的，我決不抽身事外，我隨時都可以帮忙」二人又談一會，雲卿便行回去。到第二日渚齋來時，雲卿把和鳳笙所討論情形，述了一遍，喜得渚齋連連鞠躬竹揖。雲卿道：「你不要得意，事情正開始，還沒完呢！我是盡力帮你的忙，以後要看你良心如何。你萬一別有作用，來欺騙我，我可要不擇手段報復！」</p>

<h3>Election of the First Legislative Yuan Members Begins Today Across the Country; President and Madame to Personally Vote</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 20th] The election of Legislative Yuan members will commence simultaneously on the 21st in 47 provinces and cities across the country, 18 leagues and banners in Mongolia, 3 electoral districts in Tibet, ethnic minority areas in special provinces, and 15 electoral districts for overseas Chinese. All male and female citizens aged 20 and above with the right to vote will participate in the voting process according to regulations. It is reported that the number of registered voters is approximately 250 million, and there are over 2,000 candidates nationwide competing for seats in the Legislative Yuan. A total of 773 Legislative Yuan members are to be elected this session.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 20th] The election of the first Legislative Yuan members of our country is scheduled to begin nationwide on the 21st and will last for three days. A total of 773 Legislative Yuan members will be elected, including 691 men and 82 women. The election in the capital city is divided into 13 districts with 95 polling stations. President Chiang and his wife will personally vote as citizens. The campaign activities of the Legislative Yuan candidates in the capital have reached a fever pitch. Furthermore, regarding Ms. Li Jianhong, a female Legislative Yuan candidate in the capital, after the Kuomintang Central Standing Committee provisionally approved her as a substitute candidate, it is reported that President Chiang has reviewed and decided to maintain the original status, not increasing the number of female candidates beyond Liu Heng. The Central Standing Committee has already notified the election committee to cancel the change.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Kaifeng, 20th] Due to bandit disturbances and transportation obstructions in certain counties in Henan, the number of voters has not been fully ascertained. Moreover, the list of Legislative Yuan nominees from political parties arrived late from the Central Government to the province, and there was insufficient time to print ballots, making it difficult to postpone the election. The provincial election committee held an emergency meeting yesterday and, after careful discussion, decided that the Legislative Yuan election in this province will be rescheduled after all preparations are completed.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Changchun, 20th] The list of candidates for the national professional organizations' Legislative Yuan election in the Northeast region has been fully received in Changchun. The city election committee has formally announced it today. All other election matters have also been fully prepared. The election date will be announced after receiving a telegram from the provincial election committee confirming it.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 20th] On the eve of the Legislative Yuan election, Zhang Lisheng, Chairman of the General Election Committee, stated in response to reporters' inquiries that the procedures for the Legislative Yuan election are no different from those of the National Assembly election. However, voting in the Legislative Yuan election uses a circle-marking method. The list of candidates for each district has been printed on the ballot. Voters only need to circle one person they deem ideal based on their free choice to complete the election task. However, it is important to note the "freedom to choose." According to electoral custom, we should adhere to the principle of secret ballot in any voting we conduct. Voters do not need to reveal the names of their chosen candidates to others, and outsiders should not be able to find out the names of those they voted for. In a democratic political system, respecting the freedom of others should be the highest morality, and inquiring about the candidate someone voted for is suspected of hindering their freedom of choice. Zhang further stated that the General Election Committee has instructed all election committees to strictly adhere to the election procedures and the points for improvement indicated by the General Committee, to proceed on schedule, and to avoid any deviations from the time limits and regulations. Zhang expressed great satisfaction with the enthusiastic attitude of voters nationwide during the National Assembly election. He continued: Based on the significant improvements made by various local election committees in election affairs, this Legislative Yuan election will undoubtedly be more advanced than the previous National Assembly election, and voter participation will be even more enthusiastic.

<h3>Our Technical Delegation Meets with U.S. Officials to Begin Discussions on Aid to China Plan</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 19th] The Chinese technical delegation to the United States met with officials from the U.S. State Department and several economic experts here tonight, officially commencing discussions on U.S. aid to China. Marshall was not present. After the brief meeting on the 19th, Ambassador Gu stated: Officials from the State Department, led by Assistant Secretary of State Thorp, have fully agreed with the delegation's opinion that the proposed aid plan must be implemented as soon as possible to address the serious situation in China. The meeting on the 19th was a "courtesy call" for exchanging greetings and opinions. Pei Tsu-yi, the head of our delegation, stated that preparations for our technical side to immediately meet and discuss the aid plan have now been completed. It is reported here that the aid plan, drafted earlier by the State Department, will be submitted to Congress after discussions with the Chinese delegation. The exact scope and nature of U.S. aid to China will not be announced until Congress receives the State Department's request. According to previous reports, the total amount of the request will be approximately $300 million. Ambassador Gu attended today's meeting, along with five members of our delegation: Pei Tsu-yi, Li Choh-ming, Hong Shen, Chen Liangfu, and Zhu Baozhen. In addition to Thorp, the U.S. officials present included Walter Butterworth, Director of the Office of Far Eastern Affairs, Haldore Hanson, Director of the Office of Investments and Economic Development, and Sloss, Assistant Chief of the China Desk. The Chinese delegation was hosted for lunch at the government guesthouse by Thorp on the 19th. Ambassador Gu, Zheng Shaohua, and Chen Zhi-mai were also present. Secretary of State Marshall, who met with President Truman at the White House across the street half an hour earlier, did not attend. Although our delegation is prepared to visit Secretary Marshall, the exact date has not yet been confirmed, but it is expected to occur soon. It is rumored here that the Chinese representatives will have the opportunity to study the State Department's aid to China plan in advance. The plan has been under study since last April and is expected to be submitted to Congress in a few days.</p>
<h3>Kung Hsiang-hsi Issues Statement: U.S. Aid to China is Self-Help; Adopts Gold Standard for Currency Reform</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, New York, 19th, United Press] Kung Hsiang-hsi told United Press that he believes a $1 billion loan will be sufficient as a reserve for stabilizing China's new currency, and currency stability is the foundation for China's recovery. He stated that the loan can be repaid over 15 to 20 years, which is a step towards revitalizing China's ailing economy. Kung explained that in the past, China could rely on exports and remittances from overseas Chinese to maintain its currency stability. These overseas remittances totaled $200 million annually. However, today, there is a scarcity of goods and commodities in China, resulting in hoarding and inflation. Inflation has increased the national budget, which in turn has further inflated the currency. The only solution to this problem is to recall the old currency and issue a new currency with gold as a solid foundation. Regarding where this $1 billion will be borrowed from, Kung stated, "As far as I know, Chinese officials have not yet discussed this matter because China is not yet prepared to present adequate reasons." However, Kung continued to warn: "Currently, there is much talk about U.S. aid to China. We welcome this expression of friendship simply because China is currently exerting all its efforts to eradicate a scourge that will soon threaten the United States. During the war, China received military assistance from the United States. Today, China needs ammunition to continue its suppression campaign. The United States may recognize its interest in avoiding this threat because U.S. aid to China is actually self-help." Kung also quoted a Chinese proverb, "Pulling one hair affects the whole body." He continued: "The situation in China is similar because the world is one family. Internal turmoil in China affects the entire world. Therefore, for the benefit of the world, and especially for the benefit of the United States (because the United States has much to gain or lose in this regard), the internal turmoil in China should be quelled."</p>
<h3>Lucas Urges Aid to China; Advocates Expanding New Army Training Plan; Barr Scheduled to Depart from the U.S. for China</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 20th] Major General Lucas, former head of the U.S. Military Advisory Group in China, declared here on the 20th: "The Chinese National Government is fighting for survival. He strongly urges expanding the U.S. military delegation to provide practical combat skills training to President Chiang's soldiers." Lucas continued, "The Chinese Communists are not a 'political party' but an armed 'nation' that often strikes at the vital points of the Chinese army in battles against the National Army." Lucas strongly refuted reports of corruption among officials in the National Government as "exaggerated" and "superficial," urging aid to the National Government regardless of whether it undertakes reforms before resolving the civil war. Lucas declined to elaborate on the aid to China plan, saying, "This is a matter for those above my position." However, in military terms, he said that he supports expanding the plan to train Chinese divisions, which began in Taiwan. He also stated that what is currently needed is a new soldier rotation training program to teach Chinese soldiers how to shoot and march. He advocates expanding this plan, which is currently under consideration by the highest authorities. Lucas warned that the military situation in China is rapidly deteriorating, and the equipment of the Chinese Communists is superior to that of the Japanese army. Lucas pointed out that the current policy of the U.S. State Department is limited to the scope of the plan proposed by the U.S. for China, which is only to train Chinese instructors. However, he strongly expressed his belief that U.S. Army personnel should directly supervise Chinese troops on the battlefield. Lucas said he has not seen direct evidence that the Chinese Communists are supplied with equipment by the Soviet Union, but he stated that the Communist leaders are the same type of people trained in the same schools. It is noted that Lucas, who has been in China for nearly two years, will be replaced by Major General Barr in his position in China. Barr is scheduled to fly to China on the 22nd to take up his new post.</p>
<h3>Troop Training in Taiwan Yields Excellent Results</h3>
<p>[United Press, Fengshan, Taiwan] Both the Chinese and American military authorities in Taiwan say that the Chinese troop training program under General Sun Liren, with the advice of the U.S. 26th Military Command, is very successful. This achievement is due to the efforts of the Chinese themselves, with the Americans only acting as advisors.</p>
<p>The scale of the new troop training program is not yet known, but U.S. military spokesmen estimate that Taiwan can train 200,000 new troops if all the original Japanese facilities are fully utilized. Currently, only 20,000 young soldiers from the 215th Division are being trained at the training base near Fengshan, Tainan, which was the base of the Japanese 98th Army.</p>
<p>The American advisors consist of 17 officers and 9 soldiers, led by Colonel Bowling. The American side praised the cooperative spirit of the Chinese side. A high-ranking American military officer commented on the morale of the 115th Division, saying: "The discipline of this division can be compared with that of any excellent army in the world."</p>
<p>Sun Liren's assistants are all officers from the famous New 1st Army. Despite the scarcity of materials, they are training under realistic combat conditions. Cavalry training will also begin this month.</p>
<p>The military training center has its own industrial support. The physical fitness of individual soldiers is especially emphasized during training, and they receive the same physical training as regular American soldiers.</p>
<h3>Radford Succeeds Badger as Commander of U.S. Pacific Fleet; Cooke Scheduled to Return to U.S. via Shanghai in Early February</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 19th] The Navy Department announced today that Badger has been appointed commander of the U.S. Pacific Fleet (i.e., the Seventh Fleet) to succeed Cooke. President Truman has already requested Senate approval, but the exact date of the transfer has not yet been confirmed. Cooke has not been assigned a new post. The headquarters is currently located in Qingdao. Cooke, who is 62 years old, has reached the retirement age. Navy Department officials clearly expect Cooke to retire soon.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Report] Admiral Cooke, commander of the U.S. Seventh Fleet, was recalled to the United States. He came to Shanghai from Nanjing the day before yesterday to visit old friends and purchase Chinese goods as souvenirs. Cooke left Shanghai for Qingdao at 2:00 PM on the 20th to handle official business. He will come to Shanghai again in early February and then fly directly back to the United States.</p>
<h3>Wei Lihuang Flies to Shenyang Today; Visited the President Three Times Yesterday for Instructions</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 20th] Wei Lihuang, Commander-in-Chief of the Northeast Suppression of Bandits, is scheduled to fly to Shenyang on the 21st by special plane to take up his post. He attended a dinner hosted by Zhang Qun at around 6:00 PM on the 20th and paid his respects to President Chiang three times at 9:00 PM, during which the President gave detailed instructions on the military situation in the Northeast. According to what Wei told our reporter at around 6:00 PM on the 20th, the Northeast suppression of bandits plan will only be finalized after he arrives in Shenyang and meets with Director Chen Cheng and Northeast generals. The rumors that some plans have already been decided are inaccurate. The selection of the Deputy Commander-in-Chief and Chief of Staff of the Headquarters is also not yet decided. The claim that Guo Jiziao will be appointed as Chief of Staff of the Suppression of Bandits Headquarters is purely a rumor. Wei advocates doing first and then speaking. Before arriving in the Northeast, the situation is not yet clear, so he is reluctant to express more opinions. Wei denied the rumors circulating outside that the Northeast suppression of bandits military operations will adopt a point-based approach in the future, withdrawing from some prominent areas. (News of welcome for Wei from fellow villagers in Beijing and Anhui provinces is on page 3)</p>

<h3>Five Major Cities Expand Food Rationing; Executive Yuan Maintains Original Plan; Preliminary Decision on Purchasing Foreign Rice</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 20th] The issue of expanding food rationing in the five major cities of Nanjing, Shanghai, Beiping, Tianjin, and Guangzhou was raised for discussion at the Executive Yuan meeting on the 20th. Two differing opinions were expressed during the meeting. One side advocated maintaining the original plan, while the other side opposed it. Since the treatment of civil and military personnel has been equalized, but the rationing of food has not mentioned military personnel, it is somewhat unfair. At the same time, after the expansion of rationing in the five cities, will the rest of the country also implement it? Otherwise, it would not be universal. If all were to be rationed, could the food source be resolved? Their intention was to delay the implementation.

<h3>North China Petition Delegation Busy Negotiating in Nanjing; Will Attend Central Standing Committee Meeting to Report Today</h3>

Liu Yaozhang, Speaker of the Hebei Provincial Assembly; Xu Huidong, Speaker of the Pingyuan Provincial Assembly; Shi Zizhou, Speaker of the Tianjin Provincial Assembly, and three others visited Chen Lifu, Secretary-General of the Kuomintang Central Political Committee, at 10:00 AM to give a detailed account of the current situation in the North. Chen invited the delegation to attend the Central Standing Committee meeting on the 21st to give a report. In addition, industry and commerce representatives Li Zhuchen and Ji Dianchuan went to the United Relief Headquarters.

At noon, the delegation attended a joint banquet hosted by the Northern Nine Provinces and Cities Relief and Reconstruction Association and the Northern Problem Research Association. At 3:30 PM, the delegation went to the Ministry of Food to discuss the supply of food. Regarding the issue of food transportation permits and money, Minister Yu Feipeng promised to investigate thoroughly and eliminate malpractices. Regarding food production and consumption, after studying the number of food shipments to the North since August last year, based on the December standard, the Ministry of Food estimated that 500,000 bags of flour and 30,000 shi of rice could be shipped to Tianjin per month. However, this amount is far from meeting the needs of the North. The Ministry of Food will propose that the Tianjin-Beijing Allocation Committee should be established immediately to investigate the quantity of food required and prepare for allocation based on certificates. The Northern representatives believe that no matter how the Northern food problem is solved, the source of food must be guaranteed without depletion or interruption, and they requested attention to the regularity of the supply. As for importing foreign grain with foreign exchange earned from exports, it involves the entire foreign exchange policy and remains to be discussed with the financial authorities. They were quite busy on the 20th. The planned talks with the Ministries of Finance and Economics could not be held due to time constraints. They will visit the relevant authorities for consultation on the afternoon of the 21st.</p>

<h3>Hong Kong Government Denies Forced Eviction of Chinese Residents in Kowloon City</h3>
<p>[Reuters News Agency, Hong Kong Dispatch of the 20th] If the Kowloon City problem is not resolved quickly, Xiamen and Shantou may also see demonstrations against Britain. Guangzhou sailors have decided to boycott British ships if the Hong Kong side evicts Chinese residents staying in Kowloon City again. Similar resolutions may also be made in Shantou and other ports. The British Douglas Steamship Company has ships regularly traveling between Hong Kong, Shantou, and Xiamen, and Taikoo and Jardine Matheson ships also frequently dock at these two ports. However, Hong Kong officials have denied that they will forcibly evict residents staying in Kowloon City on the 21st.

It is reported that only about 300 Chinese people remain in the old city of Kowloon, only half of the original number. The rest have voluntarily moved elsewhere, but due to the large number of Chinese visitors, the exact number is difficult to estimate.</p>

<h3>Joint Logistics Headquarters Plans to Improve Military Food; Maintaining the Same Quality and Quantity</h3>

<h3>Editorial: A New Dawn of Peace in Asia</h3>
<p>In the current turbulent world situation, the news from some parts of Asia that a new basis for peaceful cooperation has been achieved in those regions is very gratifying. These regions of Asia certainly do not refer to all of Asia; but when we think of these regions, due to the complexity of their background and the depth of their struggles, they can now obtain a basis for peaceful cooperation. This makes us place our earnest expectations on the arrival of these good news. Needless to say, the good news from these regions is, first, that Gandhi's hunger strike has resulted in a basis for peaceful cooperation among the Indian, Muslim, and Sikh communities; and second, the agreement between Indonesia and the Netherlands. The Indonesian question and the dispute between India and Pakistan, and the resulting massacre of Indians, Muslims, and Sikhs, are known to be difficult problems to solve: Now all parties have reached an agreement, and there is not only a way to solve them, but also a vision of peace in Asia. In this international situation, the arrival of this news has a stabilizing effect.</p>
<p>Regarding India, since the British withdrew from India and the establishment of the "Dominions" of the Indian Federation and Pakistan, the world's expectations for these two new states have, undeniably, been close to disillusionment due to the massacres between them. Not long after the birth of these two new states, riots and massacres broke out, and tens of thousands of Indians and Muslims bled to death; fields were barren, and people were plunged into misery. Since the Kashmir incident, India and Pakistan have been on the verge of war, appealing to the United Nations for mediation, while both sides are carrying out the massacre of innocent people within their borders. The situation is unprecedentedly tragic. In this situation, the 78-year-old Mahatma Gandhi resumed his hunger strike to call for peace and proposed a seven-point cooperation plan: 1. Allow Muslims to hold religious festivals near Delhi every year; 2. Muslims who fled to Pakistan should be allowed to return to Delhi safely; 3. The 117 mosques occupied by Hindus during the September riots should be returned to the Muslims; 4. Guarantee the safety of Muslims everywhere in Delhi; 5. Cancel the Sikh boycott of Muslims; 6. Guarantee that Muslims can travel safely on trains; and 7. Indian and Sikh refugees must not occupy the Muslim areas of Delhi.</p>
<p>After Gandhi proposed this cooperation plan, he immediately began his hunger strike on the 12th. After six days, this plan was accepted by all parties, and the Mahatma stopped his hunger strike at 12:45 PM on the 18th. This 122-hour hunger strike is reported to have achieved the following victories: 1. India agreed to restore financial payments to Pakistan; 2. Indian officials all promised to promote good relations between the dominions; 3. For the first time since September last year, residents of New Delhi allowed a large number of Muslims to walk on the streets; 4. The 117 mosques in New Delhi occupied by Sikh and Hindu refugees have been voluntarily returned; 5. The Sindh City Council in Pakistan promised to improve relations between India and Muslims; and 6. Shivaksha Singh, the leader of the Hindu extremist faction, one of the main figures who caused anti-Muslim disputes in New Delhi, agreed to abide by Gandhi's peace proposal. At the same time, according to news from Lake Success, India and Pakistan have also accepted the mediation of the United Nations on the Kashmir issue, and neither side shall have talks or measures that could make the situation worse. It is due to Gandhi's hunger strike that a stabilizing effect has been produced on the Indian situation.</p>
<p>As for the situation in Indonesia, it has not been resolved since the Japanese surrender. Although there was the Linggadjati Agreement, the ink of the agreement was not dry, and the bloodshed occurred again. Dutch troops have attacked Indonesian troops. However, the Dutch authorities, observing the current turbulent international situation, and knowing that the best use of soldiers is not to use them, have not pressed on after obtaining some victories. On the one hand, they used the United Nations organization, and through the United Nations Commission, proposed six reconciliation clauses, which were accepted by both Indonesia and the Netherlands on the 19th of this month. This agreement stipulates that the future of the Indonesian Sultanate will be determined by a national referendum. Although this vote may not be held this year, the signing of this agreement undoubtedly has established a foundation for clarifying the situation in Indonesia; from this foundation, the Indonesian question will surely be fully resolved.</p>
<p>Due to the arrival of this news, in addition to expressing our congratulations to India, Pakistan, and Indonesia, we cannot help but feel many emotions. First, the Indian, Muslim, and Sikh families only failed to treat each other with sincerity due to years of suspicion between them. As a result, the birth of the two new states was followed by bloodshed. Gandhi's hunger strike enabled the three parties to abandon suspicion, return to good terms. This shows the greatness of Gandhi's spiritual appeal, and also the ability of the three parties to prioritize the welfare of the people, show attention to the overall situation, and abandon prejudices. It must be known that the Indian, Muslim, and Sikh people not only have different religious beliefs, but also have very different lifestyles. Suspicion and jealousy have been around for a long time. Now that they can return to good terms, it is because they understand their great ambitions and can put the people's interests first; due to the establishment of this agreement, the dark future has turned into light. Second, when it comes to Indonesia and the Netherlands, there was originally a relationship between ruler and ruled; now, the Dutch government, knowing the difficulties of the times, does not go too far. This is enough to show the enlightened policy of the Hague government, and the ability of the Indonesian Republic authorities to prioritize the overall situation and finally reach an agreement is commendable. Third, due to the renewed stability in India and Indonesia, reflecting on our domestic situation, it makes us realize that the reason why our country's situation has not yet achieved a stable foundation is that we have bandits who do not prioritize national interests and do not care about the overall situation who are creating chaos. The Indian, Muslim, and Sikh people have differences in religious beliefs and lifestyles, and Indonesia and the Netherlands have differences in race and culture, but they can all reach an agreement and lay a new foundation for future cooperation; only our Communists have no differences in race, culture, or lifestyle, but they do not care about the overall situation and raise troops to create chaos. For the sake of our nation's survival, we should make the suppression of the rebellion complete as soon as possible; then it is the responsibility of every citizen to actively mobilize and participate in their respective positions. Only after the suppression of the rebellion is successfully completed can we have a stable new foundation.</p>

<h3>U.S. State Department Officially Announces Aid to Europe Fund Allocation Table: Numbers Listed Still Need to be Reconfirmed</h3>
<p>[U.S. News Service Washington Dispatch on the 20th] The State Department today released a statement on the allocation of funds for the 15-month fund under the European Recovery Program from April 1, but pointed out that the final decision will be made by the executor of the program. This statement was prepared by U.S. Ambassador to the United Kingdom Douglas in his testimony to the House Foreign Affairs Committee today for submission to Congress. The State Department explained that the numbers in the table refer to the plans of various countries, or will be decided by the executors after considering all relevant factors. The table shows that the total needs of 16 European countries and the western United States are US$12.9 billion. U.S. dollar income is estimated at US$4.9 billion, and income that may be obtained from outside the United States is US$200 million. In addition, the estimated total amount of new U.S. funds is US$6.8 billion. A statement is also attached to the table, stating that it is currently impossible to complete an accurate representation of each plan. This representation reflects the inputs that need to be obtained from the Western Hemisphere, and the sources of funds required for these inputs. The statement said: Constant adjustments are necessary to take into account factors such as the degree of success of each country's production efforts, changes in the supply of world materials, price dynamics, financial measures of countries that do not participate in the European Recovery Program, and the amount of loans lent by institutions such as the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development. Below is the distribution of economic assistance to each country participating in the European Recovery Program based on the price estimate on July 1, 1947:</p>

He estimates that the basis of economic stability can be established within two years, provided that: production efforts similar to those during wartime are implemented in peacetime. The eleven points in the plan are as follows: (1) In the next five years, the United States should purchase all raw materials produced by anyone anywhere in the world that cannot be sold in the normal commercial market without spoiling. (2) Extend the President's current powers related to tariffs for three years. (3) European countries should unite under the United Nations to form a political and economic union. (4) The United States and other countries that will participate should mutually guarantee that countries participating in this alliance will resist aggression. (5) European countries should organize, develop, and utilize all European production resources, and the resources in the Ruhr region should be regulated with priority and international control. (6) Stabilize the currency of all of Europe and establish practical exchange rates. (7) Promote a two-year production movement in the United States, and overcome the slowdown in production with longer working hours. (8) The United States should implement an anti-inflation plan, which will include restoring excess profits tax, delaying tax reductions, and giving priority to construction that will increase production. (9) Actually clear all pre-war and wartime intergovernmental debts. (10) The United Kingdom and other countries should continue to retain imperial priority for three years. (11) Establish a headquarters for peace work to formulate a global strategy that transcends everything.</p>

<h3>Aid to Europe is a Step Towards Peace: The United States is Helping Europe Regain Health, Dulles Said to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee</h3>
<p>[United Press Washington Dispatch on the 20th] John Foster Dulles, U.S. Representative to the United Nations and Republican foreign policy expert, declared to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee today that the Marshall Plan for European Recovery is a step towards peace. The United States cannot survive permanently if it merely adheres to its privileges in an environment of human suffering. The wartime wounds of the free countries of Europe are now gradually healing, but the Soviet leaders are trying to make them fatally wounded by all methods other than war. Unless the United States helps these countries regain their health, the Soviet leaders' attempts may succeed. The purpose of the Marshall Plan is to do just that.</p>

<h3>Socialist Party Congress Ends: Katayama Succeeds as Chairman: Major Changes in Internal Forces Can Be Avoided</h3>
<p>[New Asia News Agency Tokyo Dispatch on the 20th] The final day of the Japanese Socialist Party Congress went smoothly in the program of electing the highest personnel. On the issue of the party leader, the left and right factions seemed to have reached a compromise. The left wing did not nominate Matsumoto to run for election, so Tetsu Katayama safely succeeded as chairman. Although Kato Juji and Asanuma Inejiro competed for the position of Secretary-General, because the four-party policy agreement had been abolished, the left and right also expressed concessions in personnel matters, so Asanuma, as a centrist, replaced Nishio as Secretary-General. From the results of this personnel election, major changes in the internal forces of the Socialist Party were avoided.</p>
<h3>U.S. Absolute Security Only Achieved by Abolishing War: Conclusions Reached by U.S. Military and Political Leaders</h3>
<p>[United Press International, Washington, 19th] Washington officials' observations on the current world crisis clearly reflect the belief that U.S. security depends on non-military measures to prevent another war. This is the conclusion reached by government leaders and experts. For several days, congressional committees have been listening to serious reports from Secretary of State Marshall, Secretary of Defense Forrestal, and Secretary of the Army Royal. The President has also received a report from the Aviation Policy Board. These reports, taken together, lead to the unanimous conclusion that war is possible, and the true security of the United States lies in preventing it through political and economic actions. However, the Aviation Policy Board also stated: "Based on initial impressions, a major war is unlikely to occur within the next five years. The highest military authorities have expressed this view to the Board." At no time in American history during peacetime, not even in the weeks before the Pearl Harbor attack, has Washington been so concerned about the crisis of war as it is today. Ways to prevent war, especially the impact if the U.S. cannot prevent war, are preoccupying government officials and those close to the government more than any other issue. The Aviation Policy Board's report stated: "Protecting ourselves through military armaments can only provide the United States with relative security. The second best option is to obtain security through treaties. The absolute security of the United States can only be achieved by abolishing war." Forrestal told the House Committee that it would be a mistake to build a strong defense force to replace aid to Europe, as it would only create an "armed truce." Eleanor Roosevelt, recently returned from a trip to Europe, told the National Women's Press Club that the Soviet Union would attack the United States' policies as soon as they found an opportunity. The Soviet Union only respects strength, and the United States must be strong. However, Mrs. Roosevelt also emphasized the importance of avoiding war, stating that this is the true guarantee of U.S. security. In summary, one can no longer hope to escape the material effects of war, or even win in another war. The Aviation Policy Board's report also stated: "We must consider the possibility that our country may be attacked. We must assume that future aggressors will not allow the United States to mobilize its industrial power. To win, we must destroy them with a preemptive strike." The board expects that the United States will not be able to catch up by the end of 1952. After 1952, Americans must assume that other countries have created atomic weapons that can be used against the United States. The opinions of Marshall, Forrestal, and Royal were all presented during the congressional debate on the Marshall Plan for aid to Europe.</p>
<h3>Agreement Reached on Distribution of Italian Ships: Soviet Union to Receive One-Third</h3>

<h3>Bomb Thrown During Gandhi's Speech: Homemade Bomb Causes No Injuries</h3>

<h3>Britain Establishes Trade Policy to Save Dollars and Expand Markets: Currently Negotiating Trade Agreements with Seven European Countries</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 19th] British Trade Minister Wilson reported today at a press conference on Britain's trade relations with seven European countries: Denmark, Belgium, the Netherlands, Czechoslovakia, Finland, Yugoslavia, and Switzerland. Details are as follows: Denmark: British-Danish trade negotiations are continuing. Britain has been able to supply coal to Denmark, and will exchange it for some minor items needed by Britain.</p>
<p>The price difference between the two parties is close, and the negotiations are expected to be optimistic. Netherlands: Dutch and British trade negotiations were held in London last month. The lists of goods offered by both sides are under review, and negotiations can resume in The Hague in early February. Belgium: British-Belgian negotiations are currently being held in London. Trade between the two countries is expected to increase significantly this year. Switzerland: Britain has recently begun negotiations with Switzerland. British exports to Switzerland are about three times the imports from Switzerland. Yugoslavia: British negotiations with Yugoslavia began in August last year. The leader of the Yugoslav delegation, Kop Kopke, has not returned to London after returning to Belgrade for instructions. The British side expects that some agreements can be reached soon. Czechoslovakia: Britain hopes to determine the date for the start of trade negotiations with Czechoslovakia soon, but the two sides are already discussing the necessities and possible supplies. Finland: The Finnish trade delegation is scheduled to come to Britain on February 16 to review the entire issue of trade payments between the two countries. Wilson continued: The most important markets for the British government are Canada, the United States, and Argentina. The government has ordered exporters to pay special attention to the development of these three countries in order to earn U.S. dollars. The goal of Britain's foreign trade negotiations is to obtain the necessary imports while using as little of Britain's gold and dollar reserves as possible. The concept of international trade based solely on the exchange of major commodities is extremely disadvantageous to Britain. At the same time, Britain will seek to remove restrictions imposed by other countries on British imports.</p>
<h3>Mediation of Kashmir Dispute: Agreement Reached by Indian and Pakistani Representatives; Security Council's Tripartite Commission to Participate in Mediation</h3>
<p>[This newspaper's report] New York, 20th Broadcast: Lake Success Report, The Security Council today passed a resolution to send a tripartite commission to Kashmir to mediate the India-Pakistan dispute. Nine votes were in favor, with the Soviet Union and Ukraine abstaining.</p>

<p>[U.S. News Agency, Lake Success, 19th] The representatives of India and Pakistan to the United Nations are considering the Security Council's proposal on the 19th to establish a three-person mediation commission to help resolve the Kashmir dispute. This proposal was put forward by the President of the Security Council, Belgian representative Langenhove, and its formation will be similar to the tripartite commission mediating the India-Netherlands dispute.</p>
<p>[United Press International, New Delhi, 19th] Gandhi said today that he was deeply grateful for the telegrams sent by various countries around the world after he ended his hunger strike, and would always remember them.</p>
<h3>British Economic Crisis: Situation Becomes Severe; U.S. Aid to Europe Seems Too Late</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, London, 20th] Senior British government officials warned on the 20th that Britain's gold and dollar reserves will reach a "dangerous stage" before July, and the standard of living will have to be "terribly curtailed" if Marshall's aid does not arrive. The depletion of dollars and gold is "extremely dangerous," despite efforts to curb foreign exchange expenditures since last month. The gap between income and expenditure has narrowed, but unless "we can take steps to curb and further reduce our gold and dollar reserves, the most serious situation seems likely to develop." Some believe that the Marshall Plan is too late for the 1948 economic plan to directly aid Britain.</p>
<h3>Italy and Switzerland Sign Trade Agreement</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Rome, 20th] It was officially announced that the Italian-Swedish trade agreement will be signed on the 20th at the Italian Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The representatives of both sides signing the agreement will be Italian Foreign Minister Sforza and Swedish Envoy to Italy Gengde.</p>

<h3>Legislative Elections Begin Today: Starting and Ending Whistles Sound; Chief Wu of the Election Committee Solemnly Casts the First Vote; General Speculation is That Yen Hui-Ching Will Be Elected</h3>
<p>"Report from Our Newspaper" The city's first legislative election is scheduled to begin simultaneously at 8:00 a.m. today at 156 polling stations. The voting time is set for three days. On the first and second days, the voting will be from 8:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m. On the third day, it will be half a day, from 8:00 a.m. to 12:00 p.m. If there are special reasons, the director of the polling station may change the time with the consent of the supervisor, but the voting time must not be less than ten hours on the first and second days, and not less than four hours on the third day. Each factory will sound its whistle at the same time at the beginning and end of each day to ensure uniformity. During the voting, committee members Guo Zhen, Wu Kaixian, and Chen Baotai will personally inspect the polling stations, and dispatch a general supervisor, inspectors, polling station directors, and staff to manage the various duties. The police bureau will also send police officers to assist in maintaining order and protecting the ballots. Chief Wu Guozhen will personally cast the first vote at the Zhaoguang Middle School, the third polling station in the Changshu District, at 8:00 a.m. today.

<h3>Election Preparation Work Intense: Three Methods Decided for Troop Voting</h3>
<p>The election affairs office in this city is working intensely to prepare for the general election. This morning at 9:00 a.m., a discussion meeting was held with the organizers of the legislative elections in various districts. More than ten organizers from Hongkou, Gaoqiao, and other districts attended. Zhang Xiaosong presided over the meeting, and Bao Lie, chief of staff of the garrison headquarters, attended to discuss the issue of troop voting. The following three points were decided: 1. Soldiers voting in the troops originally needed to affix a photo to their election certificates. Now, due to the actual difficulties in obtaining photos, if there is no photo, an election certificate will be issued after verifying the symbol. 2. Except for the officers and soldiers of the garrison headquarters who will vote at the Shanyin Road 17th District Central National School polling station in the Zhongbei Sichuan Road District, the remaining troops will vote at their garrison. 3. The voting of security police will be handled in the same way as troop voting, verifying the election right certificate photo or symbol. Administrative police and voluntary police still need to have both an election right certificate and a national identity card, neither of which can be missing. Polling stations for troops in various districts have also been designated.</p>
<p>"Another Report" In order to strictly handle the legislative elections in various districts and occupational groups, Mayor Wu has specially dispatched four chief advisors: Wang Zhaoyu, Wang Guanting, Shen Naizheng, and Lin Kexin, to patrol and supervise the voting areas.</p>
<p>Meticulous Voting Procedures</p>
<p>Each polling station is marked with the words "Shanghai City, Legislative Yuan Legislator, Polling Station for District X, Bao X (or Group X)," and the implementation rules are posted in large characters inside the station. On both sides of the entrance, depending on the number of voters, there are several ballot issuing stations. Voters line up in order of arrival and verify their election right certificates and national identity cards (group elections do not need verification), and sign, stamp, or press their thumbprint on the voter list. After the administrator verifies that there are no discrepancies, the ballot, election right certificate, and national identity card are returned.</p>
<p>Those Who Cannot Read May Ask Someone to Mark on Their Behalf</p>
<p>The ballot writing station is equipped with multiple sets of pens and inkstones, and the names of the candidates and the standards for recognizing factory votes are posted in large characters.

<h3>Actual Municipal Finances Have Shrunk More Than Before the War in the Last Two Years</h3>
<p>"Report from Our Newspaper" The local financial situation of the city in the two years before and after the war has been compared by the Finance Bureau using the devaluation method in statistics, comparing the income and expenditure figures with the wholesale price index, in order to understand the actual increase or decrease in income and expenditure. The prices of various commodities in the city have increased significantly in the past ten years, and the financial income and expenditure figures are closely related to prices, because some taxes are calculated ad valorem, and expenditures are of course affected by prices and wages. According to the analysis results, if the income and expenditure of the 25th year are set as 100, then the devaluation number of the income ratio in the 35th year is 30, and the devaluation number of the expenditure ratio is 33. The devaluation number of the income ratio in the 36th year is 39, and the devaluation number of the expenditure ratio is 36. It can be seen that the actual value of the current income and expenditure is much less than before the war. However, the income and expenditure in the 36th year have made considerable progress compared to the previous year. Throughout the 36th year, the monthly income and expenditure situation was able to keep pace with prices, which should be attributed to the positive consolidation of taxation. If the annual average of the 35th year is set as 100, then the best month for income in the 36th year was October, with 147, and the lowest was June, with 71. For expenditures, the highest was January, with 168, and the lowest was June, with 64.</p>

<h3>Improving Civil Servants' Living Standards; How is the Index Compiled?</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 19th] After repeated appeals from the Legislative Yuan, the Control Yuan, and the Senate, the method of paying civil and military officials based on the cost of living index, the adjustment plan of the Public Education Personnel Treatment Committee under the direction of the Accounting Office and the Special Review Committee designated by the State Council, has met and discussed many times, and after many twists and turns, it was approved at the regular meeting of the Executive Yuan on the 13th of this month and is being implemented. Although it is being piloted based on the December cost of living index and is only adjusted every three months, it is generally more reasonable to adjust according to the rise and fall of the cost of living index than the previous method of adding a few percentage points, and it is hoped that it will gradually improve after the trial of adjusting according to the cost of living index. Regarding the meaning of the civil servants' cost of living index and its compilation process, the reporter visited Xu Kan, the chief of the Accounting Office, and Zhao Zhang[blank], the deputy director of the Statistics Bureau, and only after two hours of talk did they thoroughly understand.</p>
<p>Cost of Living Index: The National Government's Accounting Office selects 28 kinds of daily necessities required for civil servants and investigates their prices. Then, with reference to the household survey and the standards of health and nutrition, it determines the minimum quantity of various daily necessities required by an adult male civil servant each month, such as two dou of rice, three feet of cloth, etc. These are called weights, which are multiplied by their respective prices and added together to obtain the total consumption value. According to the weighted total value formula, the total consumption value of the current period is divided by the total consumption value of the base period to obtain the total ratio, which is the civil servants' cost of living index.</p>
<p>For example: In the first half of 1937, the average total consumption value of each adult male in Nanjing was 15 yuan and 4 cents per month. In September 1947, the total consumption value in Nanjing increased to 543,350 yuan and 19 cents, and the cost of living index was 36,127.01 times.</p>
<p>Items Adopted: The names, qualities, units of calculation, and weights of the civil servants' cost of living index are as follows:</p>
<p>The items and quantities selected in the "Measures to Improve the Living Standards of Civil Servants in Extraordinary Times" are only general necessities and represent the minimum living standards for civil servants, but their standards are based on something. For example, in terms of food: This is similar to the food standards required for the nutrients of civil servants proposed by the Central Health Experiment Institute. The Institute proposed 29 catties of grains, 37.5 catties of vegetables, 15 catties of tofu, 5.5 catties of meat, 30 eggs, and 45 taels of oil.</p>
<p>According to the method of investigating the cost of living index of civil servants, the results of the cost of living index of civil servants compiled by the Accounting Office are generally lower than the wholesale or retail price index of the same month and place. For example:</p>
<p>From the example above, the retail price index in Nanjing in September 1947 was more than 43,900 times that before the war, and the [blank] wholesale price index was also more than 43,000 times that before the war, but the civil servants' cost of living index was only more than 36,000 times. The reason for the difference here, according to the people who compiled the civil servants' cost of living index, is that the [blank] wholesale price index includes the prices of five [blank] and construction materials, and the retail price index includes some recreational or luxury goods, and the types of goods are also more numerous, representing a wider range, while the civil servants' cost of living index only includes 28 kinds of the most frugal necessities, and is subject to weighted restrictions. For example, the prices of clothing are higher than those of other categories, but the monthly demand is only three feet, which does not have a great impact on the cost of living index. This is why the civil servants' cost of living index is lower than the [blank] wholesale or retail price index. (Reporter Zou Keding)</p>

<h3>Full Picture of Gansu's Economic Development</h3>
<p>[Our Lanzhou Dispatch, 14th] During the War of Resistance, many people who rarely left their homes became long-distance travelers, gaining much knowledge and experience, which could be considered an unexpected gain. Take reporters as an example. Although I spent the past eight years circling around the southwestern provinces, I have indeed increased a lot of knowledge. Unfortunately, I never had the opportunity to go to the Northwest, which I could not help but yearn for. However, I always thought of these remote areas as windy and barren. With such difficult transportation and such a bustling life, I recently had the opportunity to visit Lanzhou due to a sudden event. I stayed in the new-style Northwest Building and strolled around Zhongshan, Zhongzheng, Zuo Gong Roads. All my feelings were the opposite of what I had imagined, which can be considered a rare opportunity for me.</p>
<p>Gansu is a poor province with vast land, sparse population, and limited production. However, the provincial capital of Lanzhou has been developed to the point where it can keep pace with the times. The Provincial Machinery Factory, Chemical Materials Factory, Coal Mine, Water Conservancy Bureau, Transportation Office, and Waterworks have all been successfully established one after another. This proves that those in charge have a spirit of hard work. General Guo Jijiang, the chairman of Gansu Province, is from Hefei, Anhui. The times require him to work hard here. The most appropriate work in a place with a large land and a small population is production and construction. General Guo has recognized this point and is working hard. He said that the construction of political, cultural, psychological and other departments must start with the economic construction of people's livelihood. Otherwise, it is impossible to talk about coordination with national defense construction. General Guo is very interested in this and has the greatest determination and confidence. He has formulated a very detailed plan for the entire Gansu Province's production and construction, and is preparing to complete the following economic construction plan within one year. I believe that the people of the country will definitely give it attention and support.</p>
<p>General Principles (1) The economic construction of this province aims to develop people's livelihood and meet national defense needs. Equal emphasis is placed on agricultural income and industrial and mining industries - increasing agricultural and animal husbandry production and promoting the prosperity of the rural economy as the foundation of industrial and mining enterprises; and advancing industrial and mining enterprises as a means of improving agricultural management and improving people's lives. The basic industry and people's livelihood industries complement each other and progress simultaneously - the development of people's livelihood industries (clothing, food, housing, daily transportation, education, and culture) guarantees the establishment of basic industries (mining, machinery, power); and the expansion of basic industries is fundamental to increasing production and enriching national defense. Close cooperation between public, private and cooperative methods - large-scale public enterprises serve as a model for improving technical standards and developing markets outside the province, while assisting and encouraging the development of private enterprises. Actively promote cooperation to enable the majority of farmers and small handicraftsmen to directly manage production, sales, distribution and other businesses.</p>
<p>(2) The economic construction of this province should mobilize the province's human, material and financial resources, advance in an orderly manner according to a certain plan, and strive to use external assistance to achieve continuous results. The unification of financial, monetary and economic measures - finance assists finance, finance promotes the economy, and the economy enriches finance. The aim is to achieve a consistent and flexible application, with responsible at each level and assistance and guidance at each level - each district and county should formulate construction plans based on the construction program, adapt to local conditions, and take the district and county as a unit. The provincial government will review and assess the plans and be responsible for completing them. The province will provide assistance for talents or resources that cannot be planned independently. Coordinating with national agencies to enhance driving force - relevant departments of the provincial government should study and cooperate with central technical agencies to effectively guide this construction cause; and conduct detailed discussions with national financial institutions and economic construction authorities on investment loans or assistance equipment to increase capital and expand scale. (4) Appeal for foreign investment and technical guidance - In accordance with central government regulations and with reference to the needs of this province, we should welcome international investment and technical talents. Encouraging private individuals to engage in construction - If the government considers a cause necessary and suitable for private operation, it may provide convenience for purchasing land, supplementing equipment, and purchasing, transporting, and selling. The government may also provide the minimum dividend and profit, depending on the province's financial resources. Private inventions should be protected and rewarded. (3) The construction cause needs talents: they should be gradually cultivated to enrich the province's leading talents and middle-level cadres in construction - strive to coordinate education with construction, reward primary school students, send university students to study abroad or fund specialists to study abroad and practice, to cultivate high-level professionals and develop vocational education, and reserve practical technical talents for various departments of economic construction. Special attention should be paid to the training of professionals in transportation, water conservancy, agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, veterinary medicine, chemical engineering, and textiles.</p>
<p>General Construction (1) Transportation construction is a prerequisite for the development of agriculture and industry. In addition to assisting the central government in building the Longhai Railway and the Tianlan and Lan'an sections, 2,000 kilometers of Biao Jin Highway will be completed. The province's major roadways and important waterways will also be repaired and renovated. (2) Water conservancy construction will complete 500,000 mu of irrigation projects. The Hexi section will continue to be carried out according to the 12-year plan. At the same time, 250 million cubic feet of contour trenches will be completed to prevent mountain floods of approximately 3,000 square kilometers. In addition, 500,000 mu of farmland will be covered with sand, and a survey of water conservancy throughout the province will be planned. (3) Agricultural and forestry construction will focus on improving agricultural techniques, including soil and fertilizer improvement, agricultural variety testing and cultivation, pest control, and agricultural tool improvement. We must plan and act simultaneously to increase the yield of major food crops by 15%. At the same time, we will complete the survey of natural forests throughout the province, implement nationalization, and encourage the people to afforest 1,000 square li. In addition, 200 million trees will be planted in rural areas throughout the province, focusing on afforestation of barren mountains. (4) Improve animal husbandry, starting from three aspects: preventing animal diseases, improving breeds, and improving nutrition. Expand the injection of goat blood toxin to prevent rinderpest, and conduct research on livestock parasites and infectious diseases. At the same time, carry out the introduction, experimentation, and promotion of various livestock breeds, protect grasslands, and increase grass production by 10% by using hillside water storage methods, and plan to establish or supplement animal husbandry and medical research institutions. (5) Industry focuses on the establishment of the wool textile industry and the chemical industry, so that it can gradually complete the production of coarse woolen cloth, dairy products, and dried meat. At the same time, promote research on the production and transportation methods of industrial raw materials such as hides, medicinal materials, petroleum by-products, and wild silk. Industries such as papermaking, sugar making, hydropower, fertilizer production, and agricultural tool manufacturing should also be carried out step by step, depending on their urgency. (Wen Xia)</p>

<h3>President Ding of Tongji University Orders Students to Resume Classes This Morning</h3>
<p>[Our Report] Regarding the indefinite strike by students at Tongji University, the school held an emergency administrative meeting the day before yesterday and decided on the following measures: Before the school order is stabilized, any activities of the student self-government association of this school are strictly prohibited. All students who are temporarily elected as so-called standing committee members and so-called directors should realize that this move is illegal and voluntarily withdraw from participation. If they do not consider it and continue to accept, it will be a violation of school regulations. The school authorities cannot tolerate it. In order to avoid implicating too many people, we hereby reiterate the previous purpose and issue a final warning, hoping that the so-called standing committee members and directors will seriously consider it and not take any illegal actions again. If they dare to violate it, the school will never tolerate it. During the period when the student self-government association stops activities, if the students have any requests to make to the school authorities, they may be received, but there must be no more acts of coercion and resistance in the form of class boycotts. Each college can send up to one or two representatives, and first submit a written request to the dean's office before arranging a meeting.

If they still insist on being stubborn and continue to strike before 8 am this morning, four more students who took the lead in advocating this strike will be expelled today, and thirteen others will be placed on probation, and seventeen others will be given two major demerits.</p>

<h3>Taiwan Province's First Education Conference: Gathering Education Experts from Across the Province to Discuss Qualitative Improvement and Enrichment</h3>
<p>[Our Taichung Dispatch, 20th] The first education administration conference of Taiwan Province, aimed at reviewing the successes and failures of the past two years of education and setting standards for future improvement, opened at the Taichung Cultural City. The organizers at least hope that this conference will serve as a national model.</p>
<p>Minister of Education Zhu Jia-hua, focusing on the coordination of education at all levels, delivered a "farewell address" to the more than 200 attendees. He expressed his gratitude and admiration for the dedication of educators who have worked to change the face of education in Taiwan over the past two years. He mentioned the education implemented by the Japanese during their rule in Taiwan, saying: "The oppressive, enslaving education adopted by the Japanese, which harmed our people, must be swiftly cut away. However, we must retain what is useful, incorporate it, and carry it forward." He added that the Japanese achieved a certain scale and foundation during their half-century of stability, which cannot be ignored. He concluded by hoping that the province's education at all levels would be coordinated to serve the country and benefit society.</p>
<p>Zhu recounted his impressions of Taiwan Province over the past five days, saying that while the New Life Movement had been promoted for over a decade in the mainland, the habit of queuing for tickets and boarding vehicles had not been well established. In contrast, the people of Taiwan already had this habit. He said that the various unreasonable phenomena in the mainland were due to instability and needed to be corrected.</p>
<p>Supervisory Commissioner Yang Liang-gong loudly proclaimed that education should not be about producing officials but about cultivating experts and technicians who can contribute to industrial and mining production!</p>
<p>The education conference brought together principals of secondary schools and above from across the province, as well as guests and experts. They came from all over the province, with four-fifths being from the mainland. Minister Zhu expressed his hope that they would compare education in Taiwan with that in the mainland and seek improvements. The conference had 45 proposals, mostly concerning funding and administrative issues.</p>
<p>Funding, salaries, and living conditions also need urgent solutions in Taiwan!</p>
<p>Currently, Taiwan has one national university, three provincial colleges, sixty-eight provincial secondary schools, and one hundred and thirty-two county secondary schools, plus private secondary schools, totaling two hundred and sixteen. The province has: over 240 higher education instructors; 1,906 provincial secondary school instructors; and 15,763 elementary school teachers. There are: over 1,375 higher education students; 59,605 secondary school students; and 843,000 elementary school students.</p>
<p>In terms of quantity, development has reached a considerable stage, with only qualitative improvement and enrichment needed. Indeed, qualitative improvement is urgently needed! The current quantitative development not only fails to conceal the qualitative poverty but also reveals a crisis!</p>
<p>Generally, it is believed that the first education conference will only be a gathering of educators from across the province and will not have good results. Perhaps spending on equipment and facilities would be more effective and practical. However, the Education Bureau has high expectations, as this is, after all, the first conference in more than two years.</p>
<p>Taichung is the most tranquil and beautiful cultural city in the province. The weather these days is mild and sunny, like early spring. Following the provincial games, a three-day education conference is being held here, with displays from various units, making Taichung proud. (Reported by our Special Correspondent, Mu Yun)</p>

<h3>Basketball League Results from Last Night: Qingbai and Changli Succumb to Encas Due to Lack of Endurance; Renyu Overwhelms US Military Police; Chunmao Overcomes Yizhong After Fierce Battle</h3>
<p>[Reported by Our Newspaper] There were three matches in the basketball league last night. Although the audience at the Municipal Gymnasium was not crowded, the matches were all quite intense. In Group A, Qingbai lost to Encas 35-47 due to a lack of endurance in the later stages, which was a pity, as Qingbai was leading 22-19 in the first half. In the first match in Group A2B, Yizhong led all the way, leading by two points, 19-17, in the first half, but the result was 43-32, with Yizhong losing to Chunmao. In the second match in Group A1, Renyu overwhelmed the US Military Police due to the disparity in strength, with a one-sided situation. The score in the first half was 39-14, and the result was 72-34, with Renyu winning decisively.</p>
<p>Chunmao Defeats Yizhong</p>
<p>In Group A2B, Chunmao defeated Yizhong 43-33. The score in the first half was 26-14. Both sides had talented players, with He Jingui and Huang Tianlie scoring the most points for Chunmao.</p>
<p>Renyu Defeats US Military Police</p>
<p>In Group A1, Renyu decisively defeated the US Military Police. Wu Xinyun, Yao Wen, Wang Huaiting, and others were considered dangerous players by the opposing team. Mr. of the US Military Police was also agile and a standout player. The score in the first half was 39-14, and the situation was more balanced in the second half, with a score of 33-20, resulting in a final score of 72-34.</p>
<p>Encas Defeats Qingbai</p>
<p>Encas took the stage with authority, scoring two consecutive baskets. The Qingbai players rose up and tied the score at seven each. Zhou Dayun scored two consecutive hollow shots, taking the lead 15-11. Encas called a timeout. At 20-17, Encas's player, Ge Peng, broke his glasses and left the game. The score in the first half was 22-19, with Qingbai leading by three points.</p>
<p>In the second half, Zhao Baokun and Zhang Shaoqing had excellent passes, but Encas's aggressive attacks were formidable and continued to close the gap. When V. Kairos scored a basket, the score was 26-27, with Encas taking the lead by one point. Ma Han added another basket, Shaoqing scored, and Xu Ting made a free throw, tying the score at 30. Encas had better luck, scoring several consecutive baskets. Qingbai was greatly affected and, despite adjusting the lineup, it was ineffective. The final score was 47-35, with Qingbai losing by twelve points.</p>

<h3>Flourishing Black Market for Gold and US Dollars; Remittance Income Continues to Decrease; No Increase in Remittances After Adjustment of Minimum Foreign Exchange Rate</h3>
<p>According to the person in charge of the International Department of the Bank of China, since the new year, remittance income has further decreased. In the past week, the remittances received by the bank were only slightly over 5,100 US dollars and slightly over 320 British pounds, which is even less than at the end of last year. After the Financial Management Bureau twice disrupted the secret mechanisms for trading US dollars in Shanghai's black market, the black market price of US dollars has disappeared. However, the current black market for remittances is now based on the convenience of tax verification in the Guangzhou black market. The black market for gold and US dollars in Guangzhou is still extremely rampant. If the black market for gold and US dollars in Guangzhou can also be hit head-on, then remittances may gradually increase. As for the relationship between remittances and foreign exchange market prices, they have fundamentally decoupled. In the past, each adjustment of the foreign exchange rate could increase remittances slightly, but this time, even with the foreign exchange rate adjusted to 123,500 yuan, there was no increase in remittances. With the black market for foreign exchange still rampant, the future of remittance income is not optimistic.</p>
<h3>Frequent Dumping by Guangdong Merchants Forces Hua Shares Lower</h3>
<p>Yesterday, Hua shares were frequently dumped by Guangdong merchants, repeatedly undermining investor confidence. Although there was some upward momentum, they were still forced lower. Trading volume was low, with many short positions, but the cash supply ultimately helped support actual values, so the overall trend was still consolidation. The morning opening was upward, with Yong Yarn opening at 735 yuan and 752 yuan, then rising to highs of 738 yuan and 758 yuan. After much selling, prices fell back to 720 yuan and 739 yuan. Spot interest rates outside the exchange opened at 0.33 yuan and 0.375 yuan, then fell further to lows of 708 yuan and 721 yuan. After 11:00 AM, prices stabilized and began to rise again, reaching highs of 746 yuan and 771 yuan near noon, before closing at 745 yuan and 770 yuan. Compared to the previous close, cash shares of Xinhua, Zhabei, and Beimei rose by 0.5%, Zhongni fell by 0.5%, Shangwu was unchanged, and the rest rose slightly. For forward shares, Qinxing was unchanged, Meiya rose by 10%, and the rest rose slightly.</p>
<p>Although the forward market opened high, starting at 762 yuan and 776 yuan, selling by Guangdong merchant No. 202 immediately pushed prices down. There was significant intervention by the Bank of China, and fears of a cash shortage resurfaced, pushing prices down to 738 yuan and 744 yuan. Although external prices were quoted over 30 yuan higher, and the internal market also rose to 750 yuan and 760 yuan, prices were ultimately forced down to close at 735 yuan and 742 yuan. Compared to the morning close for cash shares, Xinhua, Meiya, and Xinyi fell by 0.5%, Zhongsi fell slightly by 10%, Zhongfang and Zhongni were unchanged, Yongsha, Zhabei, Huaxin, Xinhe, Tongyi, Shangwu, Huafeng, Huoshe, Xinguang, Lianan, Jingfu, Qinxing, Neiyi, and Zhongfa fell slightly, and the rest rose slightly. For forward shares, Xinhe and Jingfu fell by 0.5%, and the rest fell slightly. There were no significant changes in unlisted shares traded outside the exchange.</p>
<h3>Government Bonds Weaken, Foreign Shares Steady</h3>
<p>Government bonds weakened yesterday, with only Tong-wu rising slightly, with a turnover of 5 million yuan. Tong-bing opened in the morning at 80,000 yuan, with a low of 77,000 yuan, a high of 82,000 yuan, and then stabilized. Compared to the previous close, Jia-yi fell by 2,000 yuan, Bing-ding was unchanged, and Wu rose by 1,000 yuan. There was some elasticity in yesterday's popular foreign shares, while less popular shares fell. Foreign merchants were selling, and securities and currency dealers were buying. Yi-sha opened in the morning at 520,000 yuan, with a low of 500,000 yuan and a high of around 580,000 yuan, and then fell slightly to close at 550,000 yuan. Compared to the previous close, paper stock rose by 10%, Yeguang rose by 0.5%, Kan-zhi fell by 10%, Yipi and Gangye were unchanged, and the rest had minor changes.</p>
<h3>Rayon Slightly Higher, Silk Market Situation Stable</h3>
<p>The rayon market was initially weak but then strengthened, resulting in a slight increase of less than 2 million yuan. No. 120 Xuzi silk opened at only 90 million yuan, with a very balanced supply and demand. By noon, it had risen to 1.5 million yuan. In the afternoon, it continued to strengthen, with the final selling price being 2.5 million yuan. Dongyang and Tianqiao also followed suit.</p>
<p>Yesterday's factory silk market was stable, with trading still sparse. There was only spot trading, with high-quality spot trading around 4 million yuan and mid-quality spot trading around 2 million yuan. Tiger Stove Silk was at 90 million yuan. There were no transactions for all grades of five-lot heads and dry silk, and there was no change in asking prices.</p>
<p>The silk market was stable yesterday, with silk quilt covers rising by 200,000 yuan. Huaqiang goods opened at 1.2 million yuan with transactions, and buying interest was strong, immediately pushing it to 500,000 yuan for the spot price. Then, due to profitable selling, it gradually weakened, closing at 1.2 million yuan for the spot price, and 550,000 yuan to 600,000 yuan for the next-day spot price. Other goods were firm.</p>
<h3>Cotton Merchant Association Meeting Suspended</h3>
<p>[Reported by Our Newspaper] The Cotton Merchant Association of this city was scheduled to hold a subcommittee meeting at 2:00 PM yesterday to discuss the purchase contract entrusted by the Yarn Control Committee. However, as the contract from the Yarn Control Committee had not yet arrived, the meeting was suspended. Around 4:30 PM, the chairman of the association, Liu Pingsun, was met by Zhu Suwu, deputy director of the Procurement and Transportation Department of the Yarn Control Committee. It is reported that they exchanged views on the drafting of the contract. It is expected that the contract will be sent to the Cotton Merchant Association today for further discussion.</p>
<p>Cotton Collection Statistics</p>
<p>[Reported by Our Newspaper] It is reported that since September of last year, the China Textile Construction Company has collected and stored a total of 652,976 dan of new cotton. The total amount of cotton stored in various regions is 1,009,449 dan.</p>
<p>Indian Cotton Arrives</p>
<p>[Reported by Our Newspaper] The British company's "Odessa" arrived in Shanghai from Bombay yesterday, carrying 30,000 bales of cotton, which are currently being unloaded at the Gonghexiang Wharf.</p>
<h3>Registration of Cotton Yarn Reproduction Industry: Total of 1,000 Manufacturers</h3>
<p>[Reported by Our Newspaper] The Yarn Control Committee has been rushing to register the reproduction industry in the city for several days. As of yesterday (20th), approximately 6,000 registration forms have been submitted by 11 units, including machine dyeing and weaving, towels and bedsheets, woven belts, handmade cotton weaving, knitting, wool textile, and spinning. Approximately 3,000 or more yarn merchants and storage merchants have applied for registration. In total, there are approximately 9,000 manufacturers. The application for registration by shirt manufacturers has been approved by the committee and is currently being processed. The committee is expediting the review of all registration forms submitted by manufacturers.</p>
<h3>Prices of Cotton Yarn and Cloth Fall: 4-Count Blue Phoenix Continues to Decline Compared to the Previous Day</h3>
<p>Yesterday's cotton yarn market opened weak, with buyers showing little interest and traders offering lower prices. 42-count Blue Phoenix fine yarn was briefly seen at 56.8 million yuan. Then, as the cash supply eased slightly, speculators pushed prices up, and reproduction factories saw some buying. By the close of the market, the price had rebounded to 57.8 million yuan, but it was still 700,000 yuan lower than the previous day. The prices of other counts of coarse and fine yarn also fell by 1.2 million to 1.8 million yuan. However, 21-count Double Horse and 20-count Jincheng yarn saw more sales, and their prices rose by 1.2 million yuan.</p>
<p>Yesterday's cotton cloth market initially appeared strong, but then it weakened due to overnight short selling, and prices fell. Around 10:00 AM, Yangzi Company purchased three or four pieces of Yuan Bijie on behalf of its customers, and at the same time, customers from Changjiang also made some purchases, and the market rebounded. Near noon, as the Textile Construction Company opened as usual, traders, believing that the end of the year was approaching and sales were becoming sluggish, showed little interest. Only speculative buying was seen in the market, and prices fell again. By the noon close, most grades of 12-pound fine cloth were flat or weak. Bijie, Zhigong, and bleached cloth were relatively strong. Colored cloth and Shilin cloth remained stable. Other coarse cloth, twill, etc., were uninspired.</p>
<p>[Reported by Our Newspaper] Yesterday, the China Textile Construction Company sold cloth as usual, selling a total of 4,500 pieces. 106 applications were submitted, with manufacturers purchasing 360 pieces and cloth dealers purchasing the rest.</p>
<p>Raw Cotton Slightly Firmer</p>
<p>Yesterday's raw cotton market was firm amidst weakness. Traders had slightly more cash and showed some buying interest, and investor confidence stabilized. Furthermore, under the principle of unified purchase and distribution of cotton yarn and cloth, cotton merchants still had a way out, so those holding goods were reluctant to sell quickly. At the same time, the purchase price offered by the Textile Construction Company was slightly higher, so the trend was not weak. Today, 495 bales were traded. The factory price for Open Han fine cotton was 5,291,000 yuan, with 234 bales traded. The warehouse price for Open Han fine cotton was 5,167,000 yuan, Lingshi was 5,886,000 yuan and 6,035,000 yuan, with 261 bales traded. Zhoupu seed cotton was 1,135,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>High Asking Prices for Red and Green Tea</h3>
<p>Since the stock of red and green tea has decreased, those holding goods are more eager to sell at high prices than in the past, and asking prices have been rising steadily. However, export traders are wary of high prices and are taking a wait-and-see attitude, so the process can only be described as quietly strong. As for domestic tea, since local traders and buyers each have their own sales channels, buyers are continuing to buy strongly regardless of the high prices, and the situation is fierce, with solid footing.</p>
<p>Sugar Market Initially Weak, Then Rebounded: Green and Red Sugar Still Weak</p>
<p>Yesterday's sugar market was initially weak, then rebounded. White sugar rose by varying amounts of 50,000 to 60,000 yuan compared to the previous day. Green and red sugar continued to fall.

<h3>Grain Department Approves Additional 20,000 Bags of Flour for Re-export Last Month</h3>
<p>Northeast Yanging Area Also Approved for Opening</p>
<p>The four flour associations have already allocated the re-export quota for flour in December. The Ministry of Food telegraphed to inform them that the re-export quota has been increased by 20,000 bags, for a total of 420,000 bags.</p>
<p>Because the deadline for shipment is urgent, especially due to the presence of Yin in , the reviewing committee members are scattered in different locations, and it takes time to convene them. To simplify procedures, the quota has been allocated proportionally based on each factory's actual total production in November, which was 1,437,470 bags (the five major factories are not included; their 200,000 bags have been allocated separately). The remaining 8.348% quota is distributed to the 46 factories. Half of the flour destined for Tianjin has already been specially applied for and does not need to be reported again. The remaining flour destined for other regions (excluding Taiwan) must be submitted to the association for transfer to the ministry by January 25. Late submissions will not be accepted.</p>
<p>The ban on re-exports from the Northeast has been lifted, and all factories can now report for re-export.</p>
<p>Lumber Weak</p>
<p>Yesterday's lumber market was weak due to the arrival of foreign pine and the impact of the tight cash supply. All grades of lumber were weak.</p>

<p>The Four Joint Offices' headquarters, regarding future loan issues, has already sent letters to various banks and bureaus to quickly draft guidelines and business plans. Concerning this year's production loans, for all necessities for people's livelihoods, a fixed-order method will be adopted, and for transportation and sales, a mortgage method will be adopted to coordinate with the fixed-order loans. The following is an excerpt of the main points of the fixed-order loan guidelines for necessities for people's livelihoods drafted by the headquarters: (1) In order to cooperate with national policies, increase production, assist the government in controlling materials, and stabilize prices, in addition to handling production loans in accordance with the original guidelines, special fixed-order loans will be adopted to assist the production of necessities for people's livelihoods. (2) The targets and implementation locations for handling fixed-order loans will be determined separately according to actual needs. For those cases that have been approved by the Four Joint Offices' headquarters for special loan assistance or have been stipulated by the government for unified control, they should be handled in coordination with the original regulations. (3) For production businesses suitable for handling fixed-order loans, the competent authorities should apply to the Four Joint Offices' headquarters and forward them to various national banks and bureaus, which will individually or jointly undertake fixed-order loan businesses within their professional scope. (4) The methods for handling fixed-order loans are stipulated as follows: (1) The loan amount will be determined based on the turnover nature and production costs of each industry; (2) The loan term will be determined based on the production process of each industry; (3) When the fixed-order loan matures, the produced finished products will be delivered to repay the loan according to the quantity stipulated in the original contract; (4) The fixed-order price should protect the legitimate interests of each industry; (5) The funds required for fixed-order loans will be advanced by the Central Bank; (6) The materials obtained from the fixed-order loan business should be sold to the government's competent authorities for unified handling; (7) The progress of work, expenditure costs, raw materials, quality, and manufacturing technology of each industry receiving fixed-order loans should be reviewed at any time, and personnel may be dispatched to audit them at any time. (8) The format of this loan contract and implementation rules will be formulated separately. (9) For production businesses that have been approved to handle fixed-order loans, if they need funds for transportation and sales, various banks and bureaus may provide loan assistance in coordination with the mortgage method, but they must not lend funds in the form of other pledges and discounts. It is said that these guidelines have been approved and implemented by the board of directors of the Four Joint Offices' headquarters.</p>

Recently, the most exports have been furs, and various European countries have been in great need of furs these days, and it is also the peak season for fur sales, so sales have increased. Other items such as tung oil, bristles, tea, and eggs still have large differences in domestic and foreign prices, so although there are sales, the export figures are not many. As for export mortgage financing, the Bank of China and other banks have not stopped at the same time due to the suspension of loans from national banks and bureaus. At present, exporters can still ask to do mortgage financing to use as working capital. However, this mortgage financing is limited to 30 days, and it must be returned within the time limit.</p>

Chestnut firewood was 135,000 yuan per load last week, and yesterday's asking price rose to 145,000 yuan. Miscellaneous firewood was 123,000, pine firewood was 112,000, and dry firewood was sold for 150,000, an increase of more than 10%.</p>

<h3>Random Notes by Zhimo (1)</h3>
<p>— Posthumous Works of Xu Zhimo, Edited by Chen Congzhou</p>
<p>These random notes by Zhimo are works by the poet Xu Zhimo during his studies in the New World and England. They are all written casually, as records; some are similar to diaries, some are similar to essays, written in a very scattered manner, requiring much sorting. Ms. Shan instructed me to compile them, and now I have arranged them and tentatively named them "Random Notes by Zhimo". From these scattered fragments, one can vaguely imagine Xu's spirit and demeanor in those years, evoking endless memories for the reader. Recorded by Chen Congzhou on January 15th, 37th year.</p>
<p>From October 15th, the four of us living together will abide by the agreed rules, such as getting up at six o'clock, morning meeting at seven o'clock (inspiring shame and motivation), singing the national anthem in the evening, and going to bed at half past ten. During the day, in addition to encouraging study, we exercise, take walks, and read newspapers.</p>
<p>Ambitious but lazy; going to bed around eleven o'clock, getting up at six o'clock, afraid of the cold, mouth feels greasy, must wash before feeling refreshed, often feel sluggish after meals and want to sleep, especially in the warm library, which makes laziness escape and sleep demons invade; but I enjoy reading at night the most, which is the result of twenty years of habit. Lifelong illness is laziness. My mother never stopped thinking it was terrible, and I almost lived my entire life lazy. From now on, I will cheer up and make killing laziness my top priority.</p>
<p>Because of laziness, I am scattered and call it unconventional. My parents are both diligent and able to encourage, why is their son so scattered? Could it be the legacy of Teacher Cha Tongsun! Zhimo thinks he has a lot of blood, but he made friends with the wrong people when he was young, so he never heard any stimulating words; growing up in society, he developed a bad view and bad habits, and was so scattered and undisciplined. From now on, I will start everything in order, in a proper manner, and it will be difficult to be chaotic again.</p>
<p>Poor Zhimo has lost his spirituality for more than twenty years! Heaven cannot bear for Zhimo to end his life in such a broad way. Fortunately, he was able to travel north and his wings were refined. Looking down at the lower realm, he realized that what he had seen before was so ugly, vulgar, narrow, and filthy, how could he be like that! Looking back at myself, I am still a member of the black, ugly, vulgar, narrow, and filthy group. All of its characteristics have not been missing. Usually in the abalone shop, so used to the stink, now suddenly came to the iris world, began to feel ashamed (because human nature is good) ugly, and then its vulgarity, wash its filth, morning and evening, carefully, and still feel not up to know it, and the line has not followed; stand, but can not before also. Even if here can go before also, and difficult to protect the day after the investment in the society that has been from, although there is a peeling wash of the heart, and material desires rot outside, the roots (evil roots) sudden in the , its not lose yuan Chang who few hope! Hope grinding peeling wash of the power also? Mo to this war curse thought, wearing hair shares cannot be themselves also.</p>
<p>The other day, the English sharpness of thought , almost there has been no birth to also, whether in the past muddy society never think of this, that is, since the sea, until more than ten days ago, its pre-plug congestion, never seen the light of day also, please say the thought of today.</p>
<p>Mr. Liang's biography of the three Italian heroes, and Zhimo's blood courage began to appear. The actions of the three heroes are indeed extremely grand and delightful, and Mr. Liang's writing is also naturally strong and like a dragon soaring in the air, with the power to pull mountains and cover the world, dripping and painful, it is not only Zhimo who is low and generous, all the people in the world with blood are unable to stop the excitement! In the past, it was thought that heroes were born from heaven and could not be hoped for; now it is thought that the reason why heroes are different from others is that they can hold on to a breath of energy, quickly and directly without obstruction also. Confucius said: "I want benevolence, and benevolence is here!" As for self-deprecating their ambition to confine Ziyong and the ordinary, it is their self-seeking for the ordinary. And can not be obtained ear, Moreover in the extraordinary. To make Zhimo can hold the three masters of the meaning and spirit, and fast and straight forward also: then Mazzini Zhimo also, Garibaldi Zhimo also, Cavour Zhimo also. Only its potential has external pressure and the air has a middle decline, then nine of the power or loss of one . Ancient admiration event, Huai their three masters of the intention and spirit who, do not know its several thousands also! They who do not become, the air is weak and the intention is taken away</p>
<p>Zhimo is new in spirit, Huanhuan is like a tiger coming out of a fence, thinking that the world's affairs are not enough to be governed. Although this is floating air, please follow its origin, Zhimo thought that the ability of the ancient heroes and sages to achieve their careers must be based on something. What is it based on? Talent, learning, luck, are all its branches and not the main trunk. What is the main trunk? Only sincerity. The ability of heaven to transform, the ability of earth to create, nothing else, is only sincerity. Husband sincere then a few do God's movement of gold and stone wear yan; Therefore body then can become, Zhimo not please to its sincerity. Sincerity is the foundation. The foundation is established and the Tao is born, if the foundation is not established, then its its knowledge are like Lu Zi said by borrowing Kou soldiers steal food also. Therefore Yu Yu this Canghai flow of the day and revealed to the good knowledge, to be the first of all things. The world has gentleman, its Yu Liang also? (To be continued)</p>
<h3>On the Technique of Fiction</h3>
<p>— Yi</p>
<p>Psychological Description</p>
<p>Psychological description is one of the reasons why the author "shows his face" in the story, and psychological description is indispensable except for extremely simple stories.</p>
<p>Novels are mainly about narrating plots and describing characters. But it's not enough, the reader also needs to know what the characters in the book are thinking, how they react to their encounters, whether there are contradictions in their hearts, and what the motives for their words and deeds are. Writing down this process of thought one by one is called psychological description in the novel. The two words "psychological" are slightly different from what scientists call psychology. Psychological description in novels refers to subjective experience.</p>
<p>Describing psychological experiences has been popular since the mid-nineteenth century, and it was still the case with Henry James. Both Joyce and Virginia Woolf placed more emphasis on psychological description than James, sometimes even neglecting the layout. But there are several methods of psychological description that James did not use, and the Joyce school rarely used them, psychological analysis being one of them.</p>
<p>Psychological analysts are novelists who explain the motives of characters' behavior, especially when the motives are not very obvious. This method did not begin in the nineteenth century, it already existed in the eighteenth century, and Fielding was one of them. He treated the novel as a philosophical essay, writing about people's feelings and moods, without "dramatization" at all, but only discussing them satirically. He used a "generalized" method to discuss the psychology of characters in order to suit his moral standards. This philosophical argument can be said to be Fielding's specialty.</p>
<p>The novels of George Meredith all contain philosophical meaning. Psychological analysis often hinders the progress of the story, and is very unnatural, even more annoying than Fielding. Fielding sometimes simply and clearly narrates the action, while Eliot often discusses the depths of consciousness beyond the superficial motives, which is very close to Freud's theory of the subconscious, Meredith and Butler both have this tendency. Butler's argument is inevitably filled with the atmosphere of the eighteenth century, dry and tasteless. Originally, Victorian novels mostly emphasized both reason and emotion. Eliot's psychological description is sometimes not very wrong, but what is annoying is that she herself wants to go on stage to "show her face" and comment on the characters. She is like a teacher to the readers, lecturing and pointing, teaching there, ; and to the characters, she is like a "hen protecting her chicks", just afraid that they will make mistakes.</p>
<p>Meredith's psychological description is slightly different from Eliot's. Eliot is good at writing selfish and self-interested hearts, while Meredith's writing is more complex, is a moral and glorious heart. Meredith's is more than Fielding and Eliot, is very distinctive, and is sometimes close to dramatization, but the meaning, the tone of teaching, is even more obvious than them. At this point, the novel is not much different from historical philosophy, like doing , analyzing the characters' feelings, and establishing his philosophy of human nature. Strictly speaking, Meredith is simply not a novelist. The so-called novelist has a certain range, and a talent like Xiang Meredith has not been excluded from the novelists, and it cannot be said that it is useless to read his novels, but technique is another matter, only that he has too much abstract gossip and too little concrete description, not giving us room for imagination. His characters never had a chance to interrupt. In addition, there is a big problem is miscellaneous. Why do you say he is miscellaneous? For example, analyzing psychology, writing is indeed a bit dramatized, but he is letting the characters in the book perform themselves, and he also interjected to say a few words, which makes it very disharmonious, disharmonious is also, he himself often slaps himself in the mouth, the reason why he is slightly better than Eliot is because the writing is still dramatized.</p>
<p>French writers are also good at analyzing emotions, such as Marcel Proust. Proust's Remembrance of Things Past (Ala Recherche du temps perdu) is a masterpiece, because it is not a novel, so it may be a wild horse, talking about this and that, and it does not look as unpleasant as Meredith's work. There is also a difference between French writers and English writers. French writers mostly hold a fatalistic view, while English writers hold a free will theory. Words of teaching are everywhere. This is also where Proust has a slight advantage.</p>
<h3>Novel Quotes</h3>
<p>— Wang Yang</p>
<p>When a novelist encounters a situation where he doesn't know how to describe the characters in his work, the best way is to assume himself to be the character in the work and imagine his way out. — Blake</p>
<p>The novelist has created the "psychological destiny" of mankind, while reportage cannot but expose, sort out, and grasp the destiny that heavily covers mankind. — Malraux</p>
<h3>A Little Knowledge of Storytelling</h3>
<p>— Dai Bufan</p>
<p>The story of Shuang Jian and Su Qing</p>
<p>The story of Shuang Jian and Su Qing, in the Song dynasty, was as popular as Zhang story, and the story was often cited in operas and novels. I don't know, but the story has been around for a long time, and I have lost the plot. Recently, Zhao Jingshen has "lost the little girl" from many books, so I can know a little bit about her true face. Zhao See "New Examination of Novels and Operas" two two three-three zero eight) But Zhao seems to have missed a little ready-made information, that is also in "Stone ":" - Volume II "Mengxian Xunqiang Jiang". In "Mengxian Jiang Xunqiang", although there is a "such as Feng Shang still concubine story", Mengxian Its The actual experience is somewhat similar to Su Qing marrying Feng Sheng and Su Qing going to find . And is she married a Jiangxi merchant (salt merchant). Su Qing also married a Jiangxi merchant (tea merchant). As for the poems inscribed by Su Qing and Huizhen in Jinshan Temple, there are only a few . Now compare their differences as follows: (The poem is recorded from Zhao's book, and the ones in parentheses are from "Shi Dian Tou".)</p>
<p>"Remembering the past (since) when breaking the phoenix, so far the news is both vast, not to make a Jin wife in the coffin, into the ground should look for (still from) folding laurel lang. Peng Yanmeng (return), night rain breaking the intestine. New poetry writing (to) Jinshan Temple, hanging high the cloud sail on (over) Yuzhang."</p>
<p>This is certainly not a coincidence. In the fiftieth chapter of Water Margin, Bai Xiuying said the story: "Lu Chengjian chased Su Qing", perhaps the author of "Stone", Tian Ran Chi, had seen this story and gave it a new name, changing to to think it was already made.</p>
<h3>Random Notes on a Winter Morning</h3>
<p>— Chen Luming</p>
<p>Through my eyelids, the sky is dimly bright.</p>
<p>The shadows of yesterday's displeasure clinging to my heart disappear in the black stream of night. New hopes, radiant with smiles, step into the dawn and fall on the still silent earth.</p>
<p>The sun begins to bring precious warmth to winter. In the clear and bright sky, a white cloud slowly drifts, like a nun draped in a white veil, silently praying to the morning light in the purity of the clouds. Poets often like to entrust strange beauty to the sunset in beautiful poems. If we compare the sky at sunset to a bustling dance hall playing intoxicating jazz music, then let me describe the long sky in the morning light as a solemn and luminous sanctuary. In front of the cross, it makes the sinner reflect and repent, and the fierce ambitious person slowly lower his head, and from the depths of his conscience, he begins to praise peace and harmony. However, there is no hypocritical preacher here, only the ancient bronze bell in the spire, making a minute's respite, filling people's empty hearts with sound.</p>
<p>Birds are the most lively singers in the morning. Even in such a closed winter, their trembling, crisp, and transgressive voices bring back spring and childhood dreamscapes from the creek to people's hearts. Looking at such a small singer, and looking at the clumsy, bare mountains in this mountainous country, I laughed very comically.</p>
<p>On the withered grass, there are delicate dewdrops that have secretly condensed last night. Like playful children, they soak into people's soles, or, by the terrain, fill the stomachs of the trousers' fibers. The bold ones stand on the tops of the thatch flowers, making dazzling smiles at the morning sun. The sunlight turns them into small, frighteningly visible substances and brings them to the high sky, so the air is mixed with a healthy aroma of soil. Those who can work in this breath for a long time are just hard-working farmers who work hard all year round to nourish others. Let us bless these elemental lives. If they are safe and happy, then the entire human society will be blessed.</p>
<p>How careful should we be about the farewell of love and hate!</p>
<p>After being washed by the morning wilderness, a person's thoughts will be completely purified. Let our hearts open to nature and sing.</p>
<h3>Recent World Literary Scene</h3>
<p>— Zhao Jingshen</p>
<p>Gide's Diary</p>
<p>Andre Gide of France won the Nobel Prize for Literature at the end of last year, and now his early diary has been published in English translation, which can be said to be a gratifying event in the literary world.</p>
<p>Gide began writing a diary at the age of twenty; the complete French text is one thousand three hundred . The first volume of the American edition was translated by Albring (J. O'Brien), from the time Gide began his literary work until the edge of the First World War, so there is little narration about that war.</p>
<p>The characters narrated in this volume include almost all the great writers in Europe, such as Dandan , Maeterlinck, Wilde, Rodin, Degas, etc. The background ranges from Paris to St Germain, Rome, Tunis and Seville. Albring said in the preface that Gide's early diary mainly talked about himself, he was loyal to his own examination and dreams, philosophical contemplation and the endlessness of emotions.</p>
<p>The date of this diary is from 1889 to 1906. The part from 1901 to 1906 is the most interesting, and his own examination and philosophical contemplation are all expressed in this period. Gide wrote in 1904: "Since I finished "The Immoralist" (L Immoralite) on October 25, 1901, I have not been able to work solemnly." During this silent period, the diary was filled with (terrible insomnia), the continued struggle to prevent "the disintegration of thought".</p>
<p>A year later, Gide wrote in his country house: "Can't I calm my terrible throbbing heart? I run in the desert like a madman." The Catholic education Gide received in his youth was indeed a factor in his adult crisis. He also said: "Lord, let this too narrow ethics explode..." The path he chose was not to be honored, solemn literary work. "Around me, I am the one who creates silence." Although Gide is a moral person, he also openly admits his own sexual impulses. He believes on the one hand that he is very holy, and on the other hand he says that he is very corrupt.</p>
<p>In short, it is this struggle of emotions, this trauma, this terrible throbbing of the heart, that makes Gide an artist, that makes him escape the vanity of Stendhal or the irritability of Flaubert, and that he is not as lacking in psychological description as Aragon or Sartre. He is the only one among French modern writers who belongs to the Proust school.</p>
<p>This early diary also describes his personal life, such as the fact that he received religious forced education, he was raised by his mother and aunts, he has two houses in Normandy, he has a garden, he plays the organ, and even such trivial things as having lunch at home are written inside.</p>
<h3>The New Poet Laurie Lee</h3>
<p>During the Great War, England produced many small publications, especially in Australia, where Cyril Connolly's "Horizon" and Lehman's "Penguin New Writing" were the most famous. Laurie Lee published poems in these two publications, and at least two other poetry anthologies used his work. "The Sun My Monument" was his first collection of poems.</p>
<p>He writes well about both the countryside and war. His poems are simple and easy to understand, because the British people during the war were impatient with poets' imaginations.</p>
<p>He is worthy of being called a romantic, with a touch of sentimentality. In addition to singing pastoral tunes and lamenting ruins, he also writes love poems.</p>
<p>He also often uses metaphors, which although very common in poetry, are often easily written in a messy way, but he is able to connect different things in a very harmonious way.</p>
<p>If Laurie Lee had been born in an earlier era, he might as well have been just a happy pastoral poet, writing some fantasy poems. However, he lives in this modern world of struggle, so he is also constantly aware of the pulse of the times, and he fully sees the disharmony of the world, and wants to seek a solution.</p>

<h3>Yellowed Leaves</h3>
<p>— Jingwen</p>
<p>I happened to see in a certain newspaper a reprint of an article from the Soviet "Literary Gazette" entitled "Leaves Turn Yellow When They Leave the Tree." The title itself is poetic, and since it was published in the "Literary Gazette," it must be a poem or literary work. But after careful reading, it turned out to be a pure political propaganda article, criticizing French General de Gaulle, saying that General de Gaulle had left the people, just like leaves leaving the tree, and became yellowed.</p>
<p>I don't want to talk about de Gaulle here, because I have never been interested in figures on the political stage. People who have read some history probably have the same feeling, that no matter how turbulent and invincible a person is, from a historical perspective, he is just a fallen leaf in the forest. The world is constantly changing, and everything is like passing clouds. Who can escape the fate of being a fallen leaf under the ruthless wheels of history—or rather, time—regarding things and people that are considered great today?</p>
<p>My interest lies in the title "Leaves Turn Yellow When They Leave the Tree." This and the saying "Things must rot before worms grow in them" have the same subtle effect. It is most difficult to use metaphors when writing articles or speaking, because the function of metaphors is to express a complex idea in the most concise, easy-to-understand, and suggestive language. A good metaphor must have the basic conditions of common sense, that is, popularity. Although popular common sense is not necessarily the truth—and in many cases, it is the opposite of the truth—because it is common sense, it is easy for people to understand and accept.</p>
<p>For example, sayings like "Leaves Turn Yellow When They Leave the Tree" or "Things Must Rot Before Worms Grow in Them" are not necessarily the truth if you are strict about it. Because although leaves will turn yellow when they leave the tree, and things will inevitably breed worms after they rot, more accurately, it is really because the leaves have yellowed or are about to yellow that they leave the tree, and things will rot after they breed worms. However, in terms of common sense, everyone doesn't care about this, because the meaning is always clear anyway.</p>
<p>But the terrible thing about common sense is precisely in this place. You might as well say that common sense is the accumulation of life experiences, but you can also say that common sense is an obstacle to the progress of human intelligence. Because although many common sense ideas contain some truth, most of what is called common sense is just a soporific that leads people to go down the path of not seeking thorough understanding. There are many so-called "Common Sense Guides" and "Common Sense Q&amp;A" and other books and publications on the market, most of which are this kind of thing.</p>
<p>There is a so-called "nerve warfare" tactic in modern international relations. Propaganda expressed in words or pictures is a type of "nerve warfare." Moreover, it is said that propaganda also has techniques, the main point of which is that it should be popular and easy to understand, so that people can easily be impressed. Being able to impress people is called achieving an effect in propaganda "terminology." Therefore, people who deeply understand propaganda techniques should not only have a wealth of common sense themselves, but also understand how to use other people's common sense concepts. Because theories and doctrines cannot be fully understood by everyone, but common sense can achieve the effect of being taken for granted by everyone.</p>
<p>The article in the "Literary Gazette," if it only spoke about how General de Gaulle was wrong in the front, no matter how clear and reasonable it was, it would not leave any impression on people who were not involved. But now, by lightly using the nine characters "Leaves Turn Yellow When They Leave the Tree," not only does the title itself have considerable appeal, but in terms of "propaganda effect," it is undoubtedly better than a long political theory. Because for people who don't seek thorough understanding, just reading such a title will leave some impression.</p>
<p>However, I have to say that being able to make good use of people's common sense concepts can achieve the purpose of propaganda techniques, but this is also limited to a part of people who regard common sense as truth. For promoting truth and enlightening human intelligence, this method is not advisable, because the common sense concepts it uses are really just using human weaknesses. After a long time, the propaganda technique itself will inevitably wither like a leaf. At that time, people's logic will no longer be "Leaves Turn Yellow When They Leave the Tree," but the yellowed leaves must leave the tree.</p>
<h3>The Cat's Home</h3>
<p>— Leihong</p>
<p>Sam Goldwyn needed one hundred and fifty cats for a scene in a film. The film's props person received this urgent notice and had no choice, so he thought of the city's animal sanctuary.</p>
<p>Luckily, the owner of the animal sanctuary had just collected a large number of cats that people didn't want and had abandoned. So he handed over one hundred and fifty cats.</p>
<p>The props person asked the company authorities to reimburse the costs, at $2.50 per cat per day. But one day the company had finished filming the scene and no longer needed the cats. No one was going to take in so many little animals. The owner of the animal sanctuary took them back, and the props person came up with a great plan to clear out the kittens.</p>
<p>The next day, an advertisement appeared in the newspaper. It said that the owner of the animal sanctuary had a batch of cats that had "appeared on the silver screen," and the price was only one dollar each.</p>
<p>Every kitten in the animal sanctuary found a new home in one day.</p>
<h3>Reynolds' Feat</h3>
<p>— Heku</p>
<p>Since the end of World War II, the United States has produced at least one extraordinary person, and that person is Reynolds. Reynolds' ballpoint pen, with its appeal as a pen that doesn't use ink, shocked novelty-loving Americans, thus allowing Reynolds to start his business with ballpoint pens.</p>
<p>But the ballpoint pen was not Reynolds' invention. He obtained the manufacturing rights from foreigners, and overturned the ballpoint pens of other pen companies such as Sheaffer, fought lawsuits, and finally promoted this type of pen to the American market. Although there are several brands of ballpoint pens sold on the American market now, the Reynolds Pen Company's ballpoint pens are of course the oldest brand. Not only do Americans have one in their hands, but this type of pen can also be seen in various countries in Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>In fact, ballpoint pens are novel in their construction, but in practical terms, they may not necessarily be able to defeat fountain pens, which have a history of more than a hundred years. People who have used them have this experience, and the reason does not need to be explained. It is obvious after a comparison. Therefore, there is still room for improvement. This is a point that the Reynolds Company must consider in order to defeat the current best-selling fountain pens.</p>
<p>Therefore, Reynolds does not hesitate to spend huge sums of money to promote his own ballpoint pens. He hired pilots to fly his own "Reynolds Bomber" on a round-the-world flight, in order to break the world record for round-the-world flights. The so-called round-the-world flight is to tour around the cities that sell his Reynolds pens, in order to achieve publicity. He came to our country twice last year, and the "Reynolds Bomber" became eye-catching news in our country's newspapers.</p>
<p>Now he is coming to Shanghai again. This time it is not a round-the-world flight, but to explore China, measure high mountains and great rivers, and use another method to promote Reynolds pens. His ingenuity in advertising and the huge expenses involved are truly astonishing.</p>
<p>But I admit that Reynolds' advertising skills are more successful than his Reynolds pens! His advertising has positive significance, such as the round-the-world flight breaking the world record, and the exploration flight delving into the wilderness. These are all large-scale actions, and publicity is only one of the goals. Creating his magnificent plan and making Reynolds' name world-famous, indirectly making the new pens sell well, is his ultimate goal. He uses the task of special contribution, which is disdained by today's great men who are arguing and engulfed in war all over the world. Reynolds is willing to use the surplus of his business to complete it, which is worth paying attention to.</p>
<p>Our country is not without public-spirited entrepreneurs who "take from society and give back to society," but these are few and far between. Compared with Reynolds' feats, there is an enormous difference. Most of the bosses who make huge profits in business do nothing but extreme extravagance and embellish their personal enjoyment. Compared with Reynolds, their virtue and lack thereof are vastly different.</p>
<h3>Brands of American Goods</h3>
<p>— Daoxian</p>
<p>People who buy things like to pay attention to brands, and people who make things don't hesitate to spend huge advertising fees to create brands, in order to give buyers a deep impression.</p>
<p>The brand of goods, which is also called a trademark, always follows two major principles: first, it is easy to pronounce; second, it is simple and easy to remember. Some people like to come up with awkward and strange names, but the choice of a trademark never takes this inferior approach.</p>
<p>Many well-known brands are not very clear about their stories.</p>
<p>For example, let's talk about cigarettes. The first one to be sold in China after the victory was "Marlboro." It is not "Marx," of course, there is a reason for this. It turns out that there was a tobacco merchant named Philip Morris, who made his own cigarettes in 1847 and sold them to customers at Oxford University. Soon, he opened a branch near Cambridge University. One was Morris Oxford, and the other was Morris Cambridge. Later, it was bought by Americans, and they did not like dragging an Oxford or Cambridge tail, so they simply called it Philip Morris.</p>
<p>There is also a type of mint cigarette called Spud, which is also a person's name. This person has always rolled his own cigarettes. Once he felt a little unwell, the doctor told him to eat some menthol. He put a little in the tobacco leaves and found the taste very good, so he made and sold it himself. Later, he sold all the trademarks to other tobacco companies.</p>
<p>The name Camel was chosen because it is easy to pronounce. As for that camel picture, it is a camel from a certain circus called "Old Easy."</p>
<p>For facial soap, there is a type of palm soap related to the Egyptian beauty Cleopatra. Because it is said that this queen used palm oil to wash her face every day to make her skin beautiful. The company publicized this anecdote greatly, and palm soap became famous all over the world.</p>
<p>The original name of Norge refrigerators was "Extremely Cold Refrigerators." The company's boss wanted to change to a new trademark in 1926, and as a result, they adopted this Norwegian word. It simultaneously contains the meanings of north and cold, which is quite suitable for a refrigerator trademark. But because the company executives deeply liked this trademark name, they later used this brand for the stoves they produced.</p>
<p>The brands of American cars generally come from two sources: one is taken from historical figures, such as Lincoln and Cadillac (a French nobleman who later went to the New World and founded Detroit), etc. The other is taken from famous people in the automobile manufacturing industry, such as Ford, Buick, Studebaker, and Chrysler, etc.</p>
<h3>Heavy American Taxes</h3>
<p>—</p>
<p>The current rise in the cost of living in the United States and the huge government spending are also major reasons. The total amount of taxes paid by the American people in one year now reaches 50 billion US dollars. Although this includes state and local taxes, the federal government collects more than 40 billion yuan.</p>
<p>According to estimates by a certain agency of the federal government, the food consumed by Americans in 1946 was worth about 39 billion yuan.</p>
<p>Compared in this way, the huge government spending in the United States is even more apparent. The management fees paid by the American people to the government are more than the money they spend on food.</p>
<p>In total, one-third to one-quarter of the American people's annual income flows into the dead end of taxes. Truman's proposed budget for this year is four times higher than the highest budget in peacetime.</p>
<p>A small loaf of bread has already paid several taxes by the time it is sold on the market. Farmers who grow wheat have to pay taxes, middlemen who sell wheat on behalf of farmers have to pay taxes, millers who grind wheat into flour have to pay taxes, bakers who bake bread have to pay taxes, and grocers who sell bread have to pay taxes. The money that a housewife takes out to buy bread is also the surplus after deducting income tax.</p>
<h3>Writing a Book Is Difficult</h3>
<p>— Jinjin</p>
<p>Recently, I was honored to have a certain bookstore not abandon me and asked me to write a book about an introduction to economics, etc. It has been completed and is in the process of being typeset. Therefore, I have read a lot of books on economics, currency, banking, and the history of economics. I happened to read a passage in a monograph written by a predecessor in economics (I will not mention the great name and title of this gentleman, because he is still the scholar I admire most so far) when describing the origin of currency, which said: "In ancient Greece, cattle were used as currency. Chapter 23 of Homer's Iliad states that in a certain martial arts competition, the winner received a three-legged iron frame worth twelve head of cattle. The loser received a woman whose value was four head of cattle." At that time, I felt very strange. It is reasonable for the winner to receive a prize. But the loser can get a woman, which from a subconscious point of view, is somewhat of a good prize and seems quite incomprehensible.</p>
<p>Some time later, I also read a passage on page 21 of the 1940 edition of Money and Banking written by Professor Eujeniaglag of Rutgers University in the United States, which referred to the same fact. The original text when translated into Chinese is like this:</p>
<p>"Diomedes' arm was worth nine cattle, and Glaucus' arm was worth one hundred cattle. In the twenty-third poem of the Iliad, the first prize awarded to the wrestlers, a tripod, was worth twelve cattle, and a female captive was worth four head of cattle. Although slaves were also calculated in cattle, it was a (transaction) unit with a higher value than cattle."</p>
<p>The original text of this section has clear punctuation and does not list female captives as a type of prize, and never mentioned that it was a reward obtained by the loser. The doubts I had before disappeared.</p>
<p>Therefore, I deeply feel the difficulty of writing a book. With a pen in hand, I can't help but be cautious. Occasional errors in writing can be forgiven, but if the cattle head doesn't match the horse's mouth, wouldn't it be a laughingstock? What's more, new theories are emerging one after another. Yesterday's insights may have room for discussion today. For example, when I read the quantity theory of money, which roughly means that the value of currency is governed by the quantity of currency (including checking account balances), the rate of circulation, and the quantity of supply and demand of goods, I felt very interested and thought it made sense. However, I then read the criticism of Laughlin and others, who believed that gold and silver coins had their own value and had nothing to do with the amount in circulation. Modern scholars also believe that government spending, tax rates, wage increases and decreases, and psychological support have a greater impact on the value of currency, far above the amount of currency in circulation. I suddenly felt that writing black characters on white paper to create an eternal theory is really difficult.</p>
<h3>Legendary Figures</h3>
<p>— Jimo</p>
<p>In some convoluted or Hollywood movies, we can often see some legendary figures who either have unique skills or act extraordinarily. They either take on secret tasks, are born to die, or are bold and careful, and are not cowardly in the face of adversity, and are finally able to turn danger into safety. They are not only heroes in our minds, but also when we watch the development of the story and see them show off their skills and accomplish great things, we can't help but raise a glass to them. A friend of mine collectively calls these characters "Tough Guys," which is not without feeling.</p>
<p>However, when the author comes into contact with these "legendary" figures in real life, there seems to be very little of the exaggerated atmosphere in novels. A relative of mine once worked as an underground intelligence officer during the enemy and puppet period. Once, he was discovered by the Japanese army. My relative ran out of the back door in short clothes and barely escaped. His colleagues, unfortunately, were all executed by the Japanese army. My relative was still frightened after the pain, and although he was known for his alertness, he was a heart patient. He was able to remain calm in times of crisis, but his heart would beat faster when he heard a car horn while crossing the road!</p>
<p>There is also someone named Yi, who once fought as a guerrilla behind the Japanese army during the War of Resistance Against Japan, and was able to fire guns with both hands, hitting the target nine times out of ten. He had been in direct contact with the Japanese army on the front line and had personally killed many Japanese soldiers. After retiring from the army after the war, he resumed the life of a farmer. Looking at his dark skin and shy demeanor, wearing a blue cloth gown, who would know that his actions could be compared with those of "heroes"?</p>
<h3>Prohibition</h3>
<p>— Pinggong</p>
<p>According to a Central News Agency report from Penghu on the 18th, the people of Penghu are addicted to alcohol, and fishermen who die in the belly of fish due to drunkenness are often heard of. The county government has therefore decided to enforce prohibition on Tuesdays and Fridays, and drinking on other days is also limited from 5:00 pm to 10:00 pm. It is said that after implementation, more than 5 million yuan (Taiwan dollars) in alcohol expenses can be saved every day.</p>
<p>Although I am not a fisherman from Penghu, I also have a strong tendency to be addicted to alcohol. When Drinkwater wrote the script for "Lincoln," he wrote that Mrs. Lincoln hated others smoking, and would reprimand anyone who violated the rule. At that time, I secretly thought that Mrs. Lincoln was too unforgiving; but observing the recent situation, I saw that Puritans at home and abroad had changed direction and were once again embarking on the road to prohibition. The drunkards shown in the film "Lost Weekend" are known to drinking comrades to be completely exaggerated (and the Chinese have never drunk so messily), and people who do not drink naturally cannot be blamed for being shocked and regarding them as demons. Today, reading the Penghu County Government's ban gives me a sense of resonance—and it is equally comical.</p>
<p>I say that alcohol must never be "prohibited." Why? Because after it is "prohibited," your "addiction" will become deeper and deeper, and it will be uncontrollable. Every good drinker has had such an experience: the more others forbid you to drink, the more you want to drink. Conversely, if your capacity is only half a liter, and others give you one and a half liters at every meal, you will happily drink half a liter at the first meal, but your tongue will be numb and your heart will be upset (and if the wine is bad, you will also have a headache and dizziness). At the second meal, even if you force yourself to drink it, you will "eat but not know its taste." By tomorrow, you will have to rest a little, and at most drink a quarter of a liter at each meal. But if you can drink half a liter, and the imperial decree only allows you to drink a quarter of a liter, then the severity of this "thirst for alcohol" is simply unbearable. Going to knock on the door of a hotel in the snowy winter night is at this time. This reason is similar to "It is better to bury a monk alive than to starve him."</p>
<p>Therefore, if I were a fisherman from Penghu, then after the Penghu County Government's prohibition measure is implemented, the time when I would most want to drink would definitely be Tuesday and Friday, and if there is an "opportunity" to drink, I would definitely drink more than usual. I remember that during the period when Shanghai was occupied, the enemy and puppet authorities also prohibited drinking at noon. As a result, everyone used teapots and teacups to hold wine in restaurants. With this disguise, everyone felt at ease—and the point that I remember most deeply so far is that I drank more wine than usual at that time, and in fact, the taste of the wine was often not good, because it was already giving you face for the restaurant to let you drink, and you really couldn't be too picky.</p>
<p>Therefore, after the prohibition order is issued, there will inevitably be many who drink secretly. Because it is "secret" drinking, they drink hastily, carelessly, and casually, and therefore lose their health. It should be known that among ten people who drink alcohol, there are always one or two who still understand a little about the fun of drinking. But after a prohibition order is issued, ten drinkers are ten drunkards, and drinking at that time will really become dysentery.</p>
<h3>Carefree Flower</h3>
<p>— Chen Shenyan</p>
<p>Chapter Eight: Success Within Reach (48)</p>
<p>Yunqing said, "It's good even if he can't agree, from now on, he's not allowed to have any more ulterior motives!" Fengsheng sighed, "What you're saying is all correct, you can control people, but you can't control hearts. I knew long ago that Zhuzhai had ulterior motives, I just didn't expect him to change so quickly! I think this condition is worth putting forward, as for the vulgar urging me to find someone else, urging me to remarry, that will never happen in this lifetime." As she spoke, she shed tears again. Yunqing saw this and felt somewhat sad inside. But then she thought, this is an opportunity, I can't let it go because of a little bit of compassion, and give up on doing it. Furthermore, suggesting this idea to her is very flexible and controllable. If things go smoothly, I won't let anyone take the benefits. If there are any setbacks, Fengsheng's rights still exist. Since Zhuzhai's intentions have already changed, I can't ruin him to comfort his emotions. Even if I ruin him, I might not succeed and it would only add to the disputes. Not being able to comfort Zhuzhai would only add to Fengsheng's suffering, so what good would it do? In that instant, Yunqing's mind raced, and she made up her mind, saying, "This is where your inherent kindness and affection lie, I'm afraid Zhuzhai can't be as sincere as you are, right?" Fengsheng said, "Of course he has no affection for me, if he did, he wouldn't have taken such actions. One wrong step leads to a hundred wrong steps, it was my mother who married me to him for the sake of appearances, there's no point in regretting it now, there's only this one path to take. If I wait for him to initiate it, I'll have no foothold!" Yunqing said, "No, I only came to tell you today because I was so angry when I heard the news. The idea I came up with might not be appropriate, think about it some more!" Fengsheng said, "There's nothing to think about, I'll do it this way." Yunqing said, "I hope you'll think about it some more!" Fengsheng said, "Your idea is very beneficial to me, apart from this, I can't think of any other good solution." Yunqing said, "Then, you also have to observe the situation, don't start clashing as soon as you meet." Fengsheng said, "When do we not clash! You don't have to worry about that, I saw through it a long time ago. The two of us, husband and wife, won't be able to reconcile without going through a big storm." Hearing these words, Yunqing couldn't help but feel a stirring in her heart. These words have great insight, there's a lot to them. If I don't take advantage of her, I might be taken advantage of by her, and both sides will end up with nothing, then it wouldn't be worth it. This idea only sprouted in Yunqing's mind for a moment, and then passed. She immediately nodded and said, "I hope you'll be careful in everything, don't create trouble because of my being talkative." Fengsheng said, "Divorce between me and Zhuzhai is ultimately unavoidable, as long as he can agree to each and every condition I propose, it will be my victory. In the event that there are any twists and turns, I hope you can help again and give me a good idea." Yunqing repeatedly responded, "Yes, yes, I will definitely not withdraw from this, I can help at any time." The two talked for a while, and then Yunqing left. The next day when Zhuzhai came, Yunqing told him about the situation she had discussed with Fengsheng, which made Zhuzhai so happy that he bowed repeatedly. Yunqing said, "Don't be complacent, things are just starting, it's not over yet! I'm doing my best to help you, later on it will depend on your conscience. If you have other intentions and deceive me, I will retaliate by any means necessary!"</p>

<h3>Suburban Female Workers Respond to Group Scholarship Aid, Hoping to Inspire Compassion in Workers in All Cotton Mills</h3>
<p>To the Editor: We are a group of female workers in a cotton mill, and we are fortunate to have the opportunity to study for free in the supplementary school attached to our factory. Seeing the proposal for the "Group Scholarship Aid" in your newspaper aroused our compassion, so we gathered the savings we had accumulated over time, raising one million yuan (sent by post, with a bank draft attached) to donate to the scholarship aid fund. We hope this will serve as a modest contribution to inspire resonance among the workers in the major cotton mills in Shanghai, and to jointly support this righteous cause. We sincerely wish you well. Respectfully, All the workers of Class B of the Huimin Workers' Supplementary School</p>
<p>Lost and Found Items: The museum lost the following items when giving away gifts the other day. It is hoped that the owners will recognize them with the Social Service Department within three days. One pair of leather gloves, One Kuomintang party certificate in the name of Yong Youjun, and two cards. More than 50,000 yuan in currency. If this money is not claimed after the deadline, it will be transferred to the scholarship fund to benefit the loser.</p>
