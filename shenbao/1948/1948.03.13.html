<h3>美總統重申對華立塲　助我政府維持和平　擴大基礎並不包括中共</h3>
<p>〔美國新聞處華盛頓十一日電〕杜魯鬥總統十一日在記者招待會上重申美國對華政策，猶如渠在一九四五年十二月十五日之聲明中所表明者，即建議中國政府之基礎應予擴大。袱渠竭力說明此項政策並非共產黨應予包括在內之謂。在答覆有關中國之問題時，總統承認在中國「共產黨」與「自由份子」兩名稱之間具有若干混淆，渠解釋共產黨員爲相信自上級經由極權政府治理國家者。渠指出，中國頗多自由份子，其中許多人曾在美國受敎育，而形成一種知識階級，渠希望此輩人士能在中國政府擴大之基礎中包括在內。此一題目，係於某新聞記者詢問總統一點，即美國政策是否依然贊成將共產黨包括在中國政府之內而提及者。總統答稱：渠不知此曾爲美國之政策。渠指出，美國已與中國政府處於友好關係之中，刻正設法帮助為衆所承認之政府，維持和平。或問擴大中國政府一語，其意義是否為將共產黨列入在內，杜魯門答稱：「否」並重述其答語。或問總統能否說明一九四六年馬歇爾將軍使華之目標，總統稱：此爲一種努力，擬協助政府應付當時之局勢。於是某一記者指川，馬歇爾在由中國歸來後之報吿內，曾建議將共產黨列入政府中。總統答稱：渠並不以爲馬歇爾將軍需要共產黨加入中國政府。總統又稱：渠不要共產黨加入中國政府或任何其他國家之政府（按馬歇爾在其關於中國之報吿中，表示希望在中國政府進行改組之過渡時期內「將開放門戶容納共產黨或其他集團加入，如果彼等能共同負担對中國前途責任）。（國務卿進一步追述在總統發表政策聲明之前，中國人自已曾同意舉行政治協商會議，包括各黨各派之代表，但會議中所完成之協定並未履行）。</p>
<p>美國務院發表聲明　解釋馬卿對華政策</p>
<p>〔中央社華盛頓十一日電〕美國務院十一日下午發表一項正式聲明，將馬歇爾昨在記者招待會所作關於美國對華政策之叙述加以說明，因國務卿關於中國問題之意見已引起誤會。國務院遂指陳稱：馬歇爾之引述杜魯門總統一九四五年十二月十五日之對華聲明，乃所以表示美國相信「如中國政府之基礎予以擴大，以容納該國之其他政治份子，則對中國之和平統一與民主改革自有裨益。」國務院稱，馬氏堅認杜魯門之聲明仍屬有效。國務院之聲明繼稱：「昨有人特別詢問馬卿，擴大中國政府之基礎，是否即須容納中共之謂？」馬氏當答稱：共黨現已公開背叛政府，故此事「即是否決心容許共黨參加政府」並由中國政府決定之，美國政府不能越俎代庖。緣馬歇爾對上述問題之答覆，原先僅係一「然」字，而各記者即誤加解釋，謂美國務院仍堅持中共必須參加一聯合之中央政府，國務院今之解釋，一般皆認爲與報章對馬氏意見之解釋根本不合，對於國務院之解釋，僉信馬歇爾已撤回其前所作中共必須參加改組後之中國聯合政府之主張，國務院今之發表正式聲明，可能係因報　對馬歇爾之答話解釋各有不同有以促成之。</p>
<h3>美衆院外委會決定　草統一外援方案　經濟援華併入援歐計劃</h3>
<p>〔美國新聞處華盛頓十一日電〕衆院外委會共和黨議員十一日與衆院議長馬丁及多數黨領袖海洛克會談，決定支持一整個之外援方案，再在此方案下分爲兩種，其一爲對歐洲復興計劃及中國之經濟及救濟援助，另一則爲包括中·希·土三國之軍事援助。此事將於週五繼續討論，悉員會並定週一開始擬定法案。關於衆院方案經濟之部份，與目前參院所討論之歐洲復興案相似，但將包括對華之五億七千萬美元經濟援助在內。參院外委會並未草擬關於對希·土與對中國軍事援助之任何立法案，行政當局並未請求軍事援軍。參衆兩院最後所通過之任何援外談案，其間如有任何異議，須在會議中解決之。</p>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓十一日電〕衆院外委會不顧行政當局之反對，十一日將援軍包括於歐洲復興計劃法案內。該會主席伊頓稱：季員　將，於十二日開始草訂二部份之法案，規定以經濟援助給予中國及西歐十六國。此項法案並將包括以正確之軍事援助予中國，希臘及土耳其。伊頓並未表示此項法案將於何時到達衆院。</p>
<h3>外會人士預示　軍援三項要點</h3>
<p>旨在保證我剿共獲勝</p>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓十一日電〕據衆院外委會方面人士十一日夜預測稱：渠等以前決定列入歐洲復興總案及中國援助案之軍事援華，將包括一項三點計劃，目的在保證蔣主席在剿共戰中獲得勝利。迄今爲止，據悉：軍事援助將包括下列三點：</p>
<p>（一）供給剩餘軍火及他種戰爭配備。</p>
<p>（二）撥給現款，以供中國在美採購所需要兵工廠機器，化學用品及礦產品，供中國製造軍火之用</p>
<p>（三）南京美國軍事代表團加以改變，以便該團能直接至戰塲作戰</p>
<p>渠等稱：該會委員實際所認爲中國軍事援助所需之現款撥給，將　所揣測者爲少。渠等指出，　餘資產費用在撥款案中所費不大，而軍　代表團亦早已在中國，唯一所需要之現款，祇爲採購在中國不能獲得之機器，化學用品及礦產品，以供中國建設該國軍火工業之用。該會委員稱；渠等希望美國在南京之軍事顧間團不再受國務部之節制。渠等力稱：由於國務部之反對軍事援華，此當爲必然途徑。若干國會方面人士認爲，下年度軍事援華之實際費用，由於該委員會相信大部份物資可由剩餘物資中取得，將不致超過一億元。</p>
<h3>民航隊駕駛員談　遭蘇機襲擊經過</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕民航空運大隊第五二四號運輸機，日前在靑島附近上空遭蘇聯P—39型戰鬥機兩架追逐，並開機槍掃射。昨日該機正駕駛員鮑爾·副駕駛員詹姆斯麥克與電報員姚昌植由靑島來滬，特於下午四時邀本市新聞界報吿事實經過。略謂：「是日機中載有乘客三十五人，於　陽起飛，目的地為青島，至離靑島百餘里上空，突遭遇P—39型戰鬥機兩架，機身　有五角紅星（蘇聯飛機之標機）追逐盤旋，並示意我機令隨　機飛行。我機未置理，仍照　綫飛航，該兩機即開機槍掃射，惟係警吿性質，並無意擊落我機，故未中彈。又謂「我機在靑島安全降陸後，即將經過情形報吿當局，美駐靑美軍當局曾派機兩架升空搜尋，但未有所發現。最後，鮑氏並出示渠在「紅星」機追襲時所攝之照片三幀。</p>
<p>另訊，鮑爾稱：渠信蘇機目的在迫令該民航機在旅順或其他共區降落，搜尋情報。</p>
<h3>白吉爾飛抵故都</h3>

<h3>兩救濟機構聯席會　請美方加速運糧　並討論農業復員等問題</h3>
<p>〔中央社南京十二日電〕政院處理美國救濟物資委會　美國政府中華救濟國，於十二日晨十時舉行聯席會議，由繆嘉銘主席，中華救濟團長吉爾白瑞克及莫德氏，曁處委會各委員均出席。會中各委員除請美代表即轉美政府從速將救濟食糧運華外，並曾就本年度農業復員，廣州復堤，浙江錢塘及海堆工程經費是否繼續向中央銀行透支撥助，抑變賣物資充作補助經費等問題，交換意見。據處委會負責方面接見中央社記者時稱：該委會根據中美救濟協定，所能處理者即美國援助我國約値四千八百萬美元之救濟物資，其中以糧食爲主，四千八百萬美元中三千萬美元係美國對外援助計劃中分配我國者，其他一千八百萬美元乃美國又一次緊急貸款，除去各項開支，總計約爲四千四百五十萬美元，約合糧食十為萬五千噸。依據中美協定，此項物資美國代表可協助我政府辦理。全國配售事宜，變賣之款項可直接充作救濟經費；同時規定我國亦應籌足同等數量之食糧。是以此項救濟食糧共爲二十五萬噸，嗣經中美雙方商定先試辦四個月，並暫時以京，滬，平，津，橞五大都巿爲主，經商定三月份由糧食部　糧配售，四月份由美糧配售，五月份由巿政府籌糧配售，六月份由美糧配售。現糧食部及各巿府應籌之糧，均經籌足，美糧亦正在陸續運華中。至於美國政府中華救濟團總辦公處，在上海，靑島，南京，天津，廣州均有辦事處。依據中美救濟協定，美代表係與我政府隨時取得聯絡，如對我國政府處理該項救濟物資之辦法不同意時，有權扣發美國救濟食糧，該團切開支均另由美國救濟物資變賣所得充用。</p>

<h3>美蘇工業生產的速率比較</h3>
<p>— 吳景超</p>
<p>比較美蘇工業生產的速率，有一個困難的問題，就是時期的選擇。假如我們比較一九一七年以後兩個國家生產的速率，對於美國似欠公平，因爲一九一七年以後，美國工業化已達相當的程度，而蘇聯可以說是正在開始·一個正在開始工業化的國家，其工業生產的速率，總是比較高的，正如一個嬰孩，其上長的速率，決非成年的人所可比。舉一個例來說，一個每年只生產十部汽軍的國家，第二年如產生二十部，其速率是加了一倍。另外一個國家，如第一年已能產生一千部汽車，第二年卽使加產二百部，其速率也只加了百分之二十。所以我們比較兩國工業生產的速率，不能以蘇聯建國後的情形，與美國同時期的情形相比。另外一個辦法，便是以一八七〇年至一九〇〇年的美國工業生產速率，與蘇聯自一九一八至一九四八的工業生產速率相比·這兩個時期的長短是相同的，都是三十年。美國在一八七〇年的生產設備，與蘇聯在一九一八年的生產設備相彷彿。我們如把這兩個時期的生產速率比較，也許可以給我們一個答案，吿訴我們資本主義的國家，其發展的速率，是否能够趕得上社會主義的國家。不過這種比較，對美國與蘇聯，都有欠公平的地方。對美國欠公平的，就是十九世紀的生產技術，遠不如二十世紀。美國在一八七〇年以後三十年所能够利用的生產技術，遠不如蘇聯在一九一八年以後三十年所能够利用的。對蘇聯欠公平的，就是美國那三十年，都是太平日子，美國人可以在無外患內發的狀態下，發展其國內的經濟，而蘇聯在這三十年內，有兩三年的內憂，有五六年的外患，建設的力量，有時給破壞的力量抵消了。所以這糧比較，也有困難。</p>
<p>我在採用了各種比較方法之後，覺得有一個方法是比較妥當的。這個方法，就是在蘇聯的發展期內，選擇一個最有利的發展時期。這個時期，我選定自一九二八年起，至一九四〇年止。一九二八年，是蘇聯開始實行第一個五年計劃的日期。一九四〇年，是蘇聯加入歐洲大戰的前一年。在這個十二年內，蘇聯實行計劃經濟，動員全國的力量，在和平的狀態之下，發展他的國力。蘇聯的發展計劃，是工重於農，而重工業父重於輕工業。我們從各種工業生產統計中，特別選出重工業中的煤，鋼及石油的生產，來與美國比較。這三種物資，是工業化的基礙，也是蘇聯所最注重的。</p>
<p>我們先找出蘇聯在一九二八年這三種物資的生產量，又找出蘇聯在十二年之後，便是一九四的經濟史，看看每一種物資，那一年的生產量，與蘇聯一九二八年的生產量相似，那一年的生產量，又與蘇聯一九四〇年的生產量相似。我說相似而不說相等，因爲以年份爲單位的生產統計，很難找出兩國產量相等的年份來。</p>
<p>茲先將蘇聯一九二八及一九四〇年的三種物資牛產量列表如下：</p>
<p>物資　單位　一九二八產量　一九四〇產量</p>
<p>煤　百萬噸　二九·一　一六四·七</p>
<p>鋼　同上　四二　二一·八</p>
<p>石油　同上　九·二　三四·二</p>
<p>美國這三種物資的生產，可與蘇聯比較的年份及其產量，列表如下：</p>
<p>美國媒的生產，自與蘇聯一九二八年的產量相似的時期開始，經過了二十一年，才達到與蘇聯一九四〇年相似的產量。同樣的算法，表示鋼的增產，經過了十五年，石油的增產，經過了十三年。此處尙須補充的一點，就是關於鋼的生產，蘇聯一九四〇年的產量，有兩個說法，一爲二一·八百萬噸，一爲一八·四百萬噸，我這兒採取了較高的統計。假如採取較低的統計，則美國自與蘇聯一九二八年鋼的產量相似的時期開始，不必經過十五年，便可達到一九四〇年蘇聯的產量。平均的說：美國這三樣物資的生產，自與蘇聯一九二八年產量相似的時期開始，須經過一六·三年，才達到與蘇聯一九四〇年相似的產量。</p>
<p>十二年與十六年有奇比較，似乎資本主義下的生產速率，不如社會主義下的生產速率。但是我們很難作這種斷定。第一，我們現在只比較了三種物資的生產速率，假如我們把物資的種類加增，特別是把消費物也選幾項一併加入計算，結果一定不同。可惜這一類的統計資料，不易搜集。其次，我們要注意的，就是美國生產上列的三項物資，都是在第一次大戰以前，便達到蘇聯一九四〇年的牛產量了。在第一次大戰以前，生產的技術，遠不如第一次大戰以後的進步·美國在一八九〇年至一九〇五年間煉鋼的方法，決不如蘇聯在一九二八年至一九四〇年間所用方法的新穎。所以我所採用的比較方法，大體上對於美國是欠公平的。但是就在　種不大公平的比較方法之下，美國所表現的成績，與蘇聯相差無幾。因此這種比較，對於我們判斷兩個制度的優劣，是很有價値的參考資料。</p>
<h3>蔣主席植樹節訓詞　勉全民造林保林　各級政府予以技術協助</h3>
<p>〔中央社南京十二日電〕首都各界植樹節紀念大會，十二日晨十時在中央林業實驗所禮堂舉行，到各機關代表七十餘人，農部美籍顧問王特等三人亦參加，會中曾宣讀蔣主席所頒訓詞，左部長舜生主席致詞，謂：森林之密茂，頗足象徵一國之興盛與進步，沈市長怡致詞時，對京市近郊尙多濯濯童山，深致悠慨，並同意左部長之意見，認植樹節應為吾人警惕振奮之日，不能虛應故事而已。又京市園林建設委會，由農林部及市政府合作，計劃於本年內栽植樹苗八百萬棵，該委會於植樹節紀念會後，即假中林所召開成立大會。</p>
<p>蔣主席訓詞森林對於人類生活，影響極大，我國以農立國，發展林業，尤爲國家經濟建設急要之務，向以國民未能深切認識森林之利益，故造林事業雖已多歷年所，而造林之後，未曾注意保林，致成效不能顯著，良可惋惜。植樹節之舉行，其目的即在藉以形成一種行動，喚起人民逐漸養成自動造林·保林之風氣，蓋必有此一良好風氣，普及全國，然後造林乃能成功。政府對於此事，祗能盡選種育苗，推動指導之責，而種植保護之執行，則有賴於全民之力量。今後各級政府，務須積極推行造林運動，並大量儲備樹苗，免費供給人民，予以種植技術上之協助，而保護一項，則應督促鄉鎭保甲，自動建立森林保護之組織，庶幾十年樹木翳然成林，利用厚生，拭目可俟。南京苜善之區，具有天時地利之優良條件，尤盼主管機關按照前所飭擬之首都十年造林計劃，加緊進行，俾資式範全國，企予望之。</p>

<h3>比京五國會議通過　五十年聯防公約　下週三簽字後全文發表</h3>
<p>〔合衆社白魯　爾十二日電〕西歐五國在英法　　下十二日通過空前之五十年軍事同盟章約，以阻遏共產主義之西進。（莫斯科電台立即攻擊該約稱，由於五國人民未被諮詢，故該約缺乏法理力量或國際性戚權）該約決定如英法荷比盧五國中任何一國遭受外力攻擊，認此約爲日後北起北極洋南迄地中海之西歐聯盟之基礎。一般希望馬歇爾計劃十六國下星期一在巴黎會議時多國將參加軍事盟約。會議終了時，五國代表步出會塲，態度愉快，談笑風生。英代表賈勃稱，將於十二日飛返倫敦，其他代表亦稱將即速於十二日歸國，將草約遞呈各該國政府。僉信五國外長計劃於週三在白魯　爾會議簽署該約。可靠方而稱，條約中互助條款規定如遇侵略，五國應自動作軍事援助。締約國問如有糾紛，應向海牙國際法庭上訴。新約之正式條文尙未公佈，公報僅稱約中包括經濟，社會，文化及互助各　條款。五國外長下週簽署盟約後，預料各國政府將公佈其內容。五國會議受捷克政變及芬蘭事件之刺激，在九日內即協議成立草約，僉信此乃性質重要條約產生速度之新紀錄。據悉，通過該約之經濟條款，五國之海外屬地將結合成一集團，預料推行條款之工作將由一永久協商委員會負責，該會恐將設於倫敦。</p>
<p>〔路透社倫敦十一日電〕五國西歐聯盟條約可望於下期三在比京簽字，届時英外相貝文或當親自前往。暫定時間表乃爲貝文將於星期日離倫敦赴巴黎，參加下星期一在法國外交部揭幕之歐洲十六國復興計劃會議，渠將以英代表團團長之資格，向週一下午或週二之全體會議發表演說。星期二晚渠將自巴黎乘車赴比京，翌日簽訂五國西歐聯盟條約，至星期四返歸倫敦·　據比京大會人士透露，五國西歐聯盟公約有效期五十年，全文包括一總則及十章，總則內當包括若干條文，聲明本約主要目的，在維護自由及民主。倫敦人士對於五國盟約中安全條款之確式如何，感覺特別興趣，蓋英美法荷比　於四月中旬在倫敦討論德國問題之安全部份時，泰半當視西歐聯盟公約中之安全條款而定。此間認比京之會議，乃倫敦六國德國問題會議先後兩次會議問，及六國會議與歐洲十六國會議間之聯繫。例如比京公約關於准許新國參加西歐聯盟之條文，必將引起巴黎十六國會議之予以討論，如果五國西歐聯盟公約中之經濟聯繫，有較詳細的規定，則必將遲延其他國家之依照平等條件　加聯盟。荷比盧集團在比京會議中己曾主張，由五原來簽字國保持最可能高度之經濟合作，故料彼等在西歐聯盟已能眞正論明其經濟價値前，尙不甚歡迎他國之參加此等密切經濟聯繫。五國西歐聯盟條約中之互助條文，當以儘量避免蘇聯之反感爲宗旨，其中之防務規定亦當儘可能以歐洲爲基礎，以避免結黨反蘇之印象，而符聯合國憲章之宗義及精神。</p>

<p>〔法國新聞社華盛頓十一日電〕杜魯門總統今日招待記者稱，最近歐洲所發生之事件，已使其對世界和平之信心爲之動搖，但渠仍信和平可以維持，且必如此方能避免世界陷於破滅。繼解釋杜魯門主義稱，此主義之目的爲欲阻遏共產主義之擴張，此將仍爲美國外交政策之主要部分，並爲歐洲復興計劃之先決條件。總統又答　關於外傳渠將與史達林元帥會晤之詢問稱，「此種謠傳並無根據，迄未有人向余接洽此種約會」。</p>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓十一日電〕馬歇爾在有杜魯門總統等人列席之美國敎會聯合會議中發表談話稱，目前之世界在「極大之危機」中，美國人應以冷靜之判斷力處理之。此前數小時杜魯門總統亦曾在記者招待會中稱，最近歐洲局勢之發展已使渠早日獲得世界和平之信念動搖矣。</p>
<p>馬歇爾稱，「全世界已在互相攻計與疑懼不諒解之極大危機中，在此騷動中局勢又因競　運動而益趨複雜，此時各人應以溫和之詞句表達其意見實甚重要也」。渠稱，以前從未有目前之更需要冷靜之判斷力者，每人應認淸世界他各地之物質精神與政治之情形，以良知判斷一切。馬歇爾稱，渠對美國人士僅有一項正面之要求，立及執行歐洲付與計　。渠指斥國內外之空氣稍，「若干外國人士對我人每一項對外國幾全予誤解，我人惟有忍耐，否則即將由於疑懼而在行動上失敗」。馬氏並對英法比荷盧五國在比京議訂西歐同盟備致讚推，渠稱此爲實現許多偉大夢想之初步。</p>

<h3>英國的憲法</h3>
<p>— （英國愛梅立著匹夫譯）</p>
<p>英國的憲法，至今沒有寫成一種文讞，它毋寗是包含　歷史的經驗，被傳統所接受的一個有生命的綱領。雖然經過一再的發展，它仍保有它的許多特性。憲法的所以能兀立至今，可以說由於保留着憲法裏的若干基本精神。</p>
<p>其實只有兩大原則，確定了英國憲法發展的方向：其一是「法治」，另一便是承認中央政府受制於法律，但賦有最高的權力。英國應當感謝威廉大帝及他的繼承者，使它比歐洲任何別的國家早先享有一個强有力的中央集權政府，同時因此在英王與他的大小屬民之間，產生了一個顯著的鴻溝。這一鴻溝將所有不列顚的屬民，聯合在一起，防止王權的任意施用，並保護國家已經確立的法律。歷史上的馬搿拿卡泰大憲章，是發展中最足稱道的一頁，它的成功完全由於英王與人民間的合作與協議。前者代表國家生命中統治·指揮·及主動的一環，而後者變成了國家法律的保護人。</p>
<p>王室的開支爲國會—進行協議的所在地—大大增加它權力的主要關鍵。往往就在進行討論與談判之際，促成了別方面的改革，或是法律上的增删。另一種發展亦是相當重要的，即從前國會對英王御用的僕臣有所不滿時，往往出之於審問或貶職的方式，現在已變成爲經常向這批閣員大臣們，作比較溫和的質詢與批評。由於這一發展，再加上英王不能横行的信念，使英王個人的地位和他的行政權劃分爲二，於是形成了當今英國憲法上最主要的特點。</p>
<p>一個帝國一旦解除了個人的獨權後，在本質上已漸漸變爲帝國生命生存與統一的一種象徵，由於這種權位分化的程序，才能使英王變成全國上下效忠的中心，使對英王的忠心，超過了其他的一切。像英國這樣一個政體與社會都非常複雜的國家，除了英王以外，實在找不出別的滿意的共同中心。</p>
<p>事實上，不列顚的王座始終維持着行政與指導的權力，這種權力非但沒有削弱，而且大大的增强了。試看英國憲法上最重要的改革，莫如由國會議員中挑選一批人來任命爲閣員這一件大事。它的意義一方而好像把英王的政策，放在政黨政策之下，可是另一方面，政府因此獲得了一種控制國會的法寳，無異把國會的幾個首腦，變成了御用德看家人。</p>
<p>因為這批閣員是出身於國會的議員，而且他們以議員爲他們終身的事業，故能使國會成爲全國政治的中心及焦點。英國德政治所以能保持統一與諧和，完全由於存在於國會與政府間德人事關聯。不論憲法在演進中有多大的改革，英國在政治上德兩大精神，一直保持着它的光輝，因爲我們知道英國的憲法，歸根結底是立足於政府與人民代表。在國會裏不斷的磋商與接觸上，政府代表着指導及執行的一面，但必須得到人民的同意。爲獲得人民的同意，就必須在國會內從長計議。白格旭氏（BAGSHOT）說得好：「內閣與國會之間的作用與反作用，就是不列顚的政治生命。「在今天我們亦可說「在內閣與反對黨之間」，因爲國會內大部份的批評工作漸漸爲反對黨包辦了。</p>
<p>英國的憲法，從沒有認選民爲政治活動的原始份子，由他來選一個代表到國會裏表達他的意思，或選擇一個合乎他意思的行政機關。要知道出發點和原動力，總是操在政府手裘。英國政治生命的活動，是以政府爲中心的。談起兩黨制度，我們常認爲是歷史演變中偶然獲得的愉快結果，或者認爲是代表兩種不同思想的自然結果。這兩種說法，都有道理，但要知道英國政治的傳統是政府第一，選民的意見或國會議員的意見，只限於在贊成或反對之間擇其一而已矣。在這種傳統之下，兩黨制的產生，爲當然的道理。仔細硏究起來，還得歸功於道種傳統，才能使漸漸靠國會的多數來支持的政府，獲得其種程度的穩定性　外國的憲法模仿渚，往往在這一點上，迷失了方向，他們的想法是以一個選民的代表，經過立法的程序，以達到行政的階段，作爲政權的整個觀念，而且認爲這種觀念，是可以和憲法的外在機構連合在一起的。因爲有了這種觀念，不免抬高了選民選擇政黨的權利，幷且使選民認此爲最終的目標，因此弄得黨派紛歧，政府不再是國會的主人，而變成了國會的尾巴。獨裁與官僚政治的形成，大都由於只知道模仿英國憲法的軀売，而忽略了它的要義，忽略了必須有一個强力有及穩定的政府德傳統。在任何情形下，凡着眼於選舉代表的憲法，決不是英國的憲法，英國的制度是民主的制度，一種默契的民主，幷不是通過選舉或委任制的民主，英國的政府是和人民在一起的，可不是人民的，亦不是國會的，借用冠冕堂的口吻，是英王在國會裏組成的。（未完）</p>
<h3>防止國內共黨活動各國採取戒備措施</h3>
<p>〔聯合社倫敦十一日電〕捷克外長馬薩里克之暴卒，與該國其他種種事變，今日已在歐洲各國引起反響。瑞士國會以一百八十七票對七票通過讉責瑞士共黨，並要求政府採取警戒行動，保衛國家。除共黨外，各黨一致　贊成票，該案內稱「過去數星期昭示民主國家若無防止內部製擊之決心，將有何種危險」。</p>
<p>海牙方面，荷蘭司法部長尼亞西文穴稱，政府將於兩日內公布組織特務警察，遏制各方極端之活動。政府籌組特務警察已有相當時期，茲因捷克政變始吿從速決定。</p>
<p>巴黎方面，法外長皮杜爾亦在國會發表演說，提及最近數月羅保匈波及捷克等國共黨之行動，據稱，此種行動不能使法國合意。法國將加緊組織歐洲其餘部份，西歐五國在比京即將完成之同盟條約實屬必要。</p>
<p>同時捷克駐外使節又有數人辭職，社會民主黨議員諾伏特尼自印度返國，道出羅馬談稱，本人已辭職。共黨此次奪取政權，事先曾有長期準備。余將設法組織一團體協助逃出本國之捷克人十</p>
<p>丹麥京城力面，國王腓烈特立克九世向歡呼　衆致詞稱，余決以全力保護丹麥爲一自由國。</p>
<p>康白拉方面，澳洲反對黨領袖孟齊斯稱，渠所領導之自由黨將提議並擁護完全禁止澳洲共黨及其他一切以共產爲目的及手段或爲共黨所控制之團體。總理齊弗萊前曾反對此舉。</p>
<h3>皮杜爾報告外交獲國會擁護</h3>
<p>〔路透社巴黎十一日電〕皮杜爾外長今日在國民議會中報吿外交政策，博得全體議員除共黨以外之擁護。皮杜爾稱：「東歐每一國內最近之發展，極相近似，此種發展之性質使否人感覺不快。西歐國家已至必須結成聯盟之時期，吾人必須以自由之原則爲基礎，團結一致。」皮杜爾於論及希臘問題時，謂希臘政府雖有缺　，然自由國家內根本不能有盡善盡美的政府，希臘政府固爲在國際監督下舉行自由選舉而產生的政府。述及法義　稅同盟時，他說，談判在繼續進行中，尙無協定成立。皮杜爾　答覆關於組織西歐集團的批評時，特列舉自一九四三年至四八年東歐國家問所簽訂之互助條約計十五組，他說歐洲有權做他處所已做的事。議員除共黨外，旋以二百卅六票多數通過擁護政府之外交政策，並以舉手通過對馬薩里　致敬</p>

<p>〔新亞社東京十二日電〕李承晚本日代表南韓民主統一總部，致函聯合　朝鮮委員會，表示贊問舉行普選。該函大意謂：「民主統一總本部係由七十個政黨社團所組成，一致贊同普選，因認普選在日前甚有必要也，並請朝鮮委員會召集各政黨社團代表，直接徵詢關於普遇之意見」。</p>
<h3>美扶植日本經濟政策將使日帝國復活中印菲諸國對此加以激烈攻擊</h3>
<p>〔中央社華盛頓十一日合衆電〕消息靈通人士稱：如東方國家仕遠東委員會，曾激烈攻擊美國扶植日本經濟之政策，並發出警吿稱：美國人正爲日本帝國主義在奠立復活之茶礎。據稱：在遠東委員會指導委員會之曾務中，曁在與美國官員交談之際，東方各國代表，對於美國去年經由國務院與陸海軍部連絡委員會所提關於日本工業永久水準之建議，皆曾發言抗議·按上項建議，仍在遠東委員會討論中。</p>
<p>消息靈通人士繼稱：各東方國家尤其憂慮者，爲美國晨後或竟根據最近發表之斯揣克報吿，將建議中之日本工業水準更予放寬。中國出席遠東委員會之代表，迄爲攻擊美國對日本工業水準之此種態度之領導人。中國代表在指導委員會上，曾發表該國對此事之意見。而印度代表與菲律賓代表，亦聲言對美國之此種能　度，不能滿意。美國現於遠東委員會指導委員會所提之建議，將對日本主要工業，許以如下之水準：年產生鐵二百萬噸，鋼塊三百五十萬噸，製鋼板二百五十萬噸，工具機廿五萬部，以及値價三千二百五十萬日元之球軸承。此外尙許其每年造船十五萬噸，保有船隻修理設備萬噸，使日本之商船隊保特兩百萬噸之噸位。但美國表示爲使日本至一九五三年時，可以自給自足計，凡此水準，相信尙須提高。現因各國在指導委員會方面正從事反對美國對日本工業水準之態度，故今日舉行之遠東委員會每週例會，在其議程上，並無進展，今日會議曾討論美國所提許日人出席國際會議，以備咨詢之建議。中國與印度代表，皆堅決反對許日人出國參加各國政政府間之會議，與會其餘各國代表，則認爲每一提案，皆應衡其利弊，予以決定，不能盲目通過，美國所有之建議，有關日本工業問題，蘇聯則未表明其立塲。</p>

<p>〔路透社華盛頓十一日電〕社魯門總統今日請國會續撥五千五百萬元，以助西歐渡過歐洲復興方案施行以前的時期，以訂購過渡期內所必需的物品。總統强調此款僅係爲援助一延長的極短過渡時期所需，蓋國會於去秋通渦對法義奧之渦渡援助案，原期得維持至馬歇爾方案實施時爲止，然就目前徵象觀，該項過渡援助於馬歇爾方案實施前，似已將用罄，故須加撥過渡援助。杜魯門致衆院議長馬丁之函內，力言最近數星期來歐洲之事件，尤不允美國甘冒於此時斷絕供應之危險，故盼國會於四月一日前，能續撥過渡期內所需之款。</p>

<h3>對收購臺煤及折耗問題燃管會解釋兩點　配售公用事業煤價低於成本議定承運時折耗非別有陋規</h3>
<p>〔中央社訊〕關於本月七日孫副主席談話中「經濟部以法幣一百五十萬萬元一噸收購合煤，而以數倍於此之價格出售」，及最近監察院報吿中稱：「開　煤到滬，碼頭工人卸煤習慣，上海千分之二十之折耗，多年陋規，一時無法革除，實際耗數，並不如此之大，此項煤斤多入黑市，抬價出售」兩點。經濟部燃管會昨特發表聲明如下：</p>
<p>斟酌需要規定配價</p>
<p>查台灣產煤除供應該省公私各項用途外，所有　出煤斤，均經該省石炭調整委員會交由本會收購運滬配售，其收購價格，則與開　在秦皇島船上交貨之價格相同，但以煤質言之，則台煤較遜於開　煤，故實際上合煤價格高於開　煤·本會於收購價格之外，再加運費，保險費，缺耗及到滬後之上下脚力等等合計，即爲本會實際收購之成本，依此成本，斟酌公私需要，分別規定配售價格，蓋因本會配售上海公用事業之煤價，尙低於收購之成本，虧折甚大，故對其他工廠配煤價格不得不略予提高，即以此項收益，彌捕上項虧折。</p>
<p>高價出售並無其事</p>
<p>孫副主席所謂「以法幣一百五十萬元一噸收購」，想係指本年一月份之煤價而言，實則該月份本會在台收購價格爲每噸一，五三〇，〇〇〇元，外加運費四五〇，〇〇〇元，延船費六七，五〇〇元，引水碼頭各費四六，八〇〇元，保險費一八，二〇〇元，缺耗六四，〇〇〇元，及上海碼頭費用（包括上下力起艙棧租碼頭設備管理等費）二一三，二〇〇元，總計每噸收購成本爲二，三八九，七〇〇元，而配售價格上海公用事業每噸爲二，一八〇，〇〇〇元，工廠每噸爲三，一四〇，〇〇〇元至於鐵路，軍遝，海車，濬浦，外埠電廠及本巿公用局所轄各機關，均係照收購成本配售，並無以數倍　此之價格出售情事。</p>
<p>卸煤折耗九八交貨</p>
<p>關於監察院發表之　委于樹德，苗培成，李肖庭等來滬調查政府對華北經濟措施之報吿要點第四一，有「開　煤，到滬碉頭工人卸煤習慣，上海十分之二十之折耗，多年陋規，一時無法革除，實際耗數並不如此之大，此項煤斤多入黑巿抬價出售」云云。與事實略有不符。查上海用煤各戶，向該會棧房或其他碼頭棧房起煤，大都委託承運車駁行辦理，自浦東棧房下船至浦西碼頭上岸，再由卡車運　到廠，一路水陸運送損耗，向　承運行包辦，視路途之遠近與廠方協議以百分之九九或百分之九八交貨。此種辦法原爲　補運送時之實際損耗，且係雙方同意者，而非別有所謂千分之二十陋規云。</p>

<h3>浙贛鐡路　杭南段通車後　西段修復　工程現狀</h3>
<p>〔本報南昌十日航訊〕浙贛鐵路杭南段通車後，西段的修復工程，更爲一般人士所重視。該路局長侯家源前在南昌召開趕工會議決定，南昌到萍鄕段的工程，決定本年六月底完成。但是，這次趕工會議決定的工程計劃，有關舖軌與橋工的負責人認爲時間短促，更須加緊趕工，問題的重心，還是在工款與材料。譬如：全綫唯一大工程的樟樹贛江大橋急需的鋼樑，還在加拿大的訂貨單上，恐怕承辦工廠，對此一批材料，根本就無法交貨，因爲梁家渡大橋的鋼樑，亦同樣訂的是加拿大貨，預定時間，是去年六月交貨，但是，梁家渡大橋現在配用的鋼樑，事實上是東拚西淡而成，那末，今日贛江大橋的材料，　路局或是交通部不另想辦法，這個「趕工」，恐怕就成問題。　現在，從南昌到萍鄕的一段路基土方工程，正在分段加緊進行假若鋼軌能够按照預定時間趕到，工程處地備從樟樹起向束向西分段開始舖軌，天　與材料如無大阻碍，釘道工程，可能在本年六月底完成，南昌到萍鄕的通車，還得看橋工的進度怎樣。記者於四日晨由南昌</p>
<p>赴樟樹　參觀　江大橋工程，並訪問負責主持該路第三區橋樑工程處長歐陽誠，對於南昌到萍鄉的五座大橋工程進度，這裏有一個記錄報導。</p>
<p>第三區橋工處主辦的五座大橋，是：南昌縣境的浹溪橋，南昌與豐城交界的山前橋，樟樹境的贛江橋，贛江支流橋和宜春萍鄉間的袁水橋。</p>
<p>溪的全長，計一一〇公尺分十孔，現用的鋼樑，除去　在原橋基河底打撈一孔外，其餘的鋼樑，都是用山前橋的舊料。自去年三月十五日開工，現在已完成全部工程的百分之九十。預定在本月十日左右，即可全部完成。</p>
<p>山前離南昌四十四公里，橋跨在山前河上，從北岸跨進　岸，就進人城縣境，公路的一座大太橋，就在鐵橋的下游，不到五百公尺。這座橋亦是去年三月二十日開工，迨至去年底止，打撈鋼樑殘軌五十四公噸多，橋長一七六公尺，施工的進度，在去年底完成下部工程，百分之五三·五，全橋工程完成百分之四九·九，這座十六孔鋼筋混凝土墩架式的大橋，在小河流上架設　橋，算是很經濟的一種工程。浙贛路沿綫，此型橋工，亦頗不少，這座橋全長一七六公尺，在第三區　工，算是第二座，工程方面，是次於贛江與哀水大橋，「山前」的十六孔鋼樑，有十一孔是準備利用贛江大橋打撈出來的材料，東拚西配的免强可以對付，還有五孔的鋼樑沒有著落，可能希望交通部撥一部份英國的軍用鋼樑，山前橋的工程，去年年底已是完成下部工程百分五三·五，全橋工程完成百分之四九·九，全部工程完成，現在預定是本月底。　贛江大橋，就是樟樹大橋，一座是跨在贛江正流，另外的一座，却是與正流大橋隔着一塊</p>
<p>小沙洲所以稱之爲江支流大橋。贛江正流大橋的工程，在浙贛路全綫，是唯一的大橋，全長五四九公尺，共分九孔，每孔六十公尺，戰時破壞時，有一個機車，掛着廿五輛不同形式的貨車車箱，在橋的中部，隨着炸藥的爆炸，例在河底的深處，所以重建工程，打撈的工作，因爲時隔數年，倒在河底的車箱，鋼軌·和戰時加　障礙物，被沙埋中冲，有的祇顯一點痕蹟，有的移動位置，工程處的估計，必需打撈出永的破舊材料，在贛江大橋的河底就有二五六〇公噸，爲了打撈工作　進行順利，他們曾經與海軍部合作，請海部派了一部份打撈人員協助進行，並且從外地僱來一批「水鬼」，作水底工作。參加水底工作的</p>
<p>水鬼現在有三組，每組五人，他們不分寒冬雨雪，穿着一套橡皮防水衣褲，頭頂着不透空氣的銅帽，在水底偵察破舊材料的位置與形態，陸上的工程人員，就是憑着他們的水底工作報吿，繪製打撈藍岡，擬訂打撈計劃，「水鬼」的工作是艱鉅，却是工價亦相當的高昂，據工程處的人說：每組五個人工作一天的工價，是四百萬元，現在贛江大橋的打撈工程，據「水鬼」的報吿，倒在水底的廿五輛車箱位置：第三孔水底有四輛，第四孔有六輛，第五孔有五輛，第六孔有四輛，第七孔有二輛，第八孔有四輛，和一部機車，已經打撈出水的有九輛，截至本年一月份止，贛江大橋的打撈紀錄是：第二孔鋼樑出水部份，打撈百分之七十，第四孔百分之四六·七，第五孔百分之四八，第七孔水中部份打撈百分之一五，合計打撈舊鋼樑九五·五公噸，佔總數百分之三七。</p>
<p>現在贛江大橋的工程，下部已完成百分之五六·五，全橋完成百分之二八·八。</p>
<p>贛江支流大橋的全長一四二·九公尺，計四孔，每孔三九公尺，自去年三月十日開工，迄年底止，完成第二墩大沉箱防水一座，抽水一座，淸鑿各墩座的破壞混凝土五九三立公方，挖基土三四〇〇立公方，除東西座外，全部接高出</p>
<p>洪水位並完成第一三兩墩，規在完成全橋下部建築工程百分之五〇·三。</p>
<p>袁水大橋，是浙贛路西段最後的一座大橋，全長一八〇公尺，分七孔，每孔寬二五公尺。自去年四月十六日開工，迄年底止，打撈鋼　全部完成，實重三七·八公噸，截至一月份止，第四，五兩墩抽水工程次第完成，佔全部抽水防水工程之百分之一四·三，淸　破壞混凝土三九四·七五立公方，挖基土一〇八公方，淸鑿及挖除工程全部完竣，第一，三，四，五，六各墩共灌混凝土二八三公方，佔全部灌注工程之百分之一四·六，全橋的下部工程，一月底止，已完成百分五六·〇二·全部需用的鋼樑，已經有五孔運到了株州，二孔還在杭州，以目前的工論，袁水大橋，到六月通車，大約可以如期完成。</p>
<p>浙贛路第三區的橋工，上年完成百分之二六·一二，截至二月底止，以上五座大橋的全部工程，已是完成百分之四二。假若舖軌工程，能够在六月底以前趕成，那末，贛江大橋的工程，若一時不能完成，路局現在預備的計劃，可能長在那　擺渡。（本報記者劉藻）</p>
<h3>空中霸王機踏上仰光大地</h3>
<p>〔本報仰光十日航訊〕空中霸王機於夕陽光輝中在仰光機塲的鋼骨跑道上降落，像跌進了宇宙的火爐間，熱辣辣的空氣，從四周向身上襲來，使人難受到近乎窒息。晚上住旅館裏，蚊蟲飛翔於帳外，電扇在頭頂整夜不停的盤旋，雖然汗是停了，心頭可還是煩燥，不安。這季節，在江南正是　飛草長的黄金日子；在仰光則正在爬向溫度記錄的最高峯。仰光　海，然而吹不到海風，所以不僅是熱，而且悶；不　悶，而且潮濕。這幾天中午普通在儿十度以上，　熱的日子可還在後而。</p>
<p>羅比身價</p>
<p>疲乏的身體　從凉水浴中獲得解放，却立刻被高物價駭了一大跳。當我們把換下的衣服交給印度侍者拿去洗時，他吿訴我們：一件襯衫的洗費是兩個羅比，一件內衣是一個羅比，羅比與國幣的比率是多少呢？在仰光，外幣可以說毫無巿面，即使是到處吃香的美金，到了此地可也如英雄末路，唯有向中國銀行按照官價去調換了。一元美金所能換到的僅是三分之一羅比。這樣算來，如洗一件襯衫與一件內衣，其代價約達美金一元之多！其他的物價亦無一不貴，如我們所住旅館，房間用木板隔開，方寬不滿兩丈（雖然這已是仰光戰後最大的旅館了），兩人一間，連三餐伙食，每天是三十五個羅比，合美金約十元。又如當地一位華僑帶我們去一家酒吧式的舞塲觀光，進去的門票是每人一個羅比，六個人在裏面坐一刻鐘，飲啤酒三瓶，連門票一共化了二十個羅比，合美金六元有餘。</p>
<p>街頭漫步</p>
<p>在仰光街頭　躂，所看到的是一幅色彩紛雜而並不調和的畫面，柏油鋪的街道雖然平滑，塵沙與垃圾却掩蓋了它的美質。戰時的創痍至今尙存，雖在鬧區也可看到瓦礫堆或僅剩了骨骼的建筑。高大洋樓的近旁往往搭着低矮烏黑的蓆棚，街頭的攤戶到處都是，賣吃食的尤其多，桌椅都放在　天，各式各樣粗糙的食物陳列於桌上，蒼蠅在與顧客搶先吮吸。裏着紅紅綠綠紗籠的緬甸人，赤足短褲的印度黑炭，在街頭混合成複雜的一片，雖然是五彩繽紛，可消除不了那根本上灰暗的膚色，灰暗的情調。</p>

<h3>植樹節　各地零訊</h3>
<p>〔本報上饒十日訊〕植樹節届，本巿各機關　體學校等，定是日晨齊集北鬥村山地集體造林，縣府正準備馬尾松苗一　株，以資應用。</p>

<h3>巡視許昌　破壞搶劫　滿目凄</h3>
<p>〔本報鄭州八日航訊〕到了許昌，先得經過車站。克復後，一去看，第一個給你的印象，破壞得太慘了。車站原像有上海北火車站的樣子，現在票房一帶，是斷壁殘瓦，一如廢城了；火車雖然還是一列一列的擺着，只是一些空架子，從任何一面看過來，都能看得穿的。近處的鐵軌，還整齊放着，遠處就一連串的，被翻在一旁了，枕木是一根看不到。一些橋梁，部是倒塌了的，有些地方還能看到幾根鋼條横七豎八的掛着。這次共匪把鐵路大翻身，認爲。於是有的人親他們破壞鐵路，有特種工具，這種特種工具是從蘇聯供給的，蘇聯在保衛列寗格拉的時候，曾經利用這種特種工具，破壞鐵路，切斷了德國的部隊·其實調查起來，並不是如此。只是共匪先把鐵路螺釘掘了以後，然后逼着五百人一組或者一千人一組的老百姓，用著木棍，組繩把鐵路一起扳了過來。共匪逼老百姓去拆大房子的柱樑，也是用着同　辦法。這樣破壞以後，再要老百姓拍拍手，於是共匪就問老百姓：『毀了，有趣嗎？』</p>
<p>城　，一些天房子，其中包括幾家銀行，參議會，以及像被共匪鬥爭的廣文書店等，除了還有四壁留着外，什麼都是光光如也。共匪把交通銀行的傢俱，在地板上點着火取煖，結果把地板也燒得光光的。西關一個敎堂和醫院，雖然被破壞程度好些，可是要揀出一件完全的東西，也是不可能了。許昌是過去曹操贈袍關公的地方，當地老百姓特別敬仰；然而關帝廟的老爺也被共匪鬥爭了，砍斷了頭。在我進去的第一天，老百姓正在重塑着。</p>
<p>所有學校都是完整的，於是有人說：這是共匪對於敎育界特別『優待」。這『優待』兩字是含着幽默口吻說的，我思索了一下，才得到『陰謀」兩個字的解釋。建國日報，許都日報，許昌日報却都被匪破壞了，在匪的看法，這些新聞事業，也許不列入文化之列了。</p>
<p>出產煙葉</p>
<p>這次許昌烟葉廠家八十二家，是被加上「官僚資本」的罪被匪刧去，但究竟多少，還是沒有一佩確數。據估計大槪集中許昌的五縣出產十分之七的烟葉，都被匪刧去。五縣出產烟葉至少有一五〇·〇〇〇·〇〇〇斤，今年烟葉收成只四成，那末是六〇·〇〇〇·〇〇〇斤，七成便是四二·〇〇〇·〇〇〇斤。這數目當然也很可觀，不過其中還應該除了在當時車站作戰被火燒去一部份。糧食一面被吃干隊吃了，一面被刧去六十輛牛車損失也是極大。</p>
<p>共匪在許昌搶刧，冬半用着「國特」的罪名臨於老百姓頭上。譬如共濟醫院，廣文書店以及一切合作社，都是這樣的被搶刧了。其次就是用就「官僚資本」的罪名，不是說你的資本是　軍長，就是說你的資本是某主席的這樣也被擄掠了好幾家。有家泰和烟廠，共匪己經把汽車開上門，預備搬廠裏的機器，並且要把廠裏的技工一起載去。廠主李掌櫃向匪講道理。匪說：是得了報吿，是劉汝明的烟廠。李掌柜就追問有什麽證據，匪說還是</p>
<p>得到報告</p>
<p>一句話。於是李掌櫃不客氣地和匪死爭，結果匪把空汽車開回去了，因爲這個廠主經了許多老百姓的證實，確實是由長垣逃難來，從擺烟攤，捲土烟起，一步一步得發起來，弄到一個烟廠。我到了許昌第二天去參觀這個烟廠，正在蒸烟的蒸烟，烤煙的烤烟，捲烟的捲烟，有三四十個工人。據說，該廠自從匪盤踞後，沒有開個一天工，國軍一進城，他們才又動工的。　差不多的交通工具，都被搶走了，黄包車君不到一輛。我聽老百姓說：「八路」禁止拉黄包車，因爲這是人拉人的事情，很不人道。我非常驚奇共匪這個奇蹟，後米消問一下，知道共匪禁絕黄包車的辦法，是第一步要他們把車子改爲架子車，第二步要他們送搶刧的物資運到豫東去，以後就不見那些車子和人了。　在鄉下，問一個牽驢的老百姓：「爲什麽你還有一只驢？」那老百姓回答說：「還不是老八嫌它又瘦又有病嗎？」他接着吿訴我，共匪在村莊，又要糧，又要人，還要槍（本報記者范世勤）</p>

<h3>徐屬的春荒</h3>
<p>〔本報徐州九日訊〕嚴重的春荒，已經沈重的壓在徐屬四百餘萬人的頭上，計算起來，到吃今夏的新麥子尙須三個月，這苦難的日子和這生死的關頭，將如何渡過？實在是徐屬九縣市的全體飢民和關心這飢民羣人的一個　　　題。</p>
<p>隴海車上</p>
<p>爲了了解徐西的豐蕭　銅等縣的春荒情形，上星期四記者曾在早晨九時搭徐商段混合車西行，到徐州北站時，那一長列混合車上，早經黑黝黝的擠滿了人，連車橙上，掛鈎上，車脊上，凡是　站人的地方都擠滿了人，我從車頭　到車尾，仔細的尋找可　容足之地，始終找不到，最後只有和守車上商量，才擠上守車，但守車上也已擠滿乘客，只好硬塞在車廂裏。據車上人說：因爲徐商間剛恢復通車，到商邱一帶逃荒的（商邱去秋收成較好，比此地糧價低三分之一），做小生意的，販糧食的人太多了，而且每天只有這一次車，當然是擠得厲害，車開了，從窗口外望，還有不少乘客被遺棄月台上。</p>
<p>黃口站上</p>
<p>三個鐘頭車抵黄口車站後，我從車廂裏爬出來，道時月台上已被上車的，下車的，買賣零食的人擠成一團。我站立在月台上，等車開出站後方始步出站後，這時發現黄口車站還有三百多人要西去沒有爬上車，手裏多拿着破棉絮行李及筐籃，人羣裏有八九十歲　老太婆，有吃奶的嬰兒，婦女占有半數，據說這都是黄口附近鄕間的災民，想搭車到民權商邱去逃荒，一個站務貝吿訴我說：這月台上每天總有三五百人搭車向西去逃荒，今春已走了兩萬多人，多半是蕭縣，豐縣，銅山的居民，這幾縣去秋遭到大水災，又加共匪不時竄擾燒殺搶刧，弄得農民十室十空，破敝不堪，黃口車站這個小鎭，從勝利到現在，已被匪刧掠三次，這個小鎭，原有五千多人口，相當繁榮，去年十一月間陳匪竄擾徐州外圍時，曾遭到空前浩刧，東半部民房商店全燬，今餘頹垣敗瓦，半城廢墟，黄口經過水災，匪災的雙重災難，而今便變成滿目荒涼了。</p>
<p>飯後到蕭縣八區區公所去訪問，區長適巧下鄕去催糧，一位姓李的助理員說：蕭縣一共有六十七萬多人口，這次水災匪災後釀成的春荒，嗷嗷待哺的就有五〇二九九三人，其中需要急賑的有二一〇三六九人，而八區十區的災情較重。據說黄口車站以北十餘里的塘沃，黑樓子等村的飢民，己經有十分之八的居民棄家逃荒去了，現在鄕間十家幾乎九家沒糧吃，紅薯葉，豆餅，麥苗，樹皮都成了普遍的大衆食品。</p>
<p>嚐麥苗飯</p>
<p>辭出區公所到街上　　，見到一個多年不見的好友王玉琳，他凄然的說：「災情已經是看不得了」，接着說：鄕間的親戚，誰家逃荒去了，誰家的女兒送給南京的親戚作養女去了，誰家的小孩子吃麥苗樹皮　臉　脚病死了，……。正說着的時候，他家的飯端出來了，他一定要我陪他吃，飯是用豆餅要苗蒸的窩窩頭，我吃了一個窩窩頭就够了，王玉琳是中產人家，飯食是如此，怎不使人望而傷感呢？飯後，我們一同到附近鄉間去玩玩，到野外隨處可見到三三兩兩剜麥苗的飢民，和剝樹皮的婦女小孩，我走近時，他（她）們都嚇跑了說是官上派來禁止剜麥苗的大員，有的孩子們喊着說：我剜的是野菜呀！我們看了孩子的背影，嘆了口氣，想到今春的麥苗被剜掉了，今夏的麥收便絕望，關係一整年的民食問題。</p>

<h3>學校行政棘手的問題　今日大學訓導　（續昨）</h3>
<p>— 孫道遠</p>
<p>現在大學訓導組織的規定，已將一般訓導人員的資格提高（各組主任要副敎授以上，訓導員要講師以上），並設訓育委員會，以羅致敎授，參議訓導，但是這些負有美名而多未授學生正課的空頭敎授與講師們，在學生的眼光裏，依然是不値得他們重視。實際上在大學裏學生們所最尊敬的，並不是負有行政大權的「長」「任」之流，而是些德高學博的敎授們。所以一個大學裏敎授們在眞正積極訓導方面實佔有決定性的作用，一般授們日常的「言行」與「傾向」，無形中是一校學生的先導與榜樣。因之，大學訓導不是一個形式的訓練，而確是一種和諧的集體生活的陶冶，以使自然形成一種優美的「習尙」與「風氣」。這種「習尙」與「風氣」就是通常所稱的「校風」。所謂「校風」，較具體的說就是一個大學裏全體共同生活的習慣。這種「習慣」也就是一個大學裏訓導學生相沿成習的不成文法；換言之，它是這個大學社會裏所自然形成的最完美的社會立法，不但學生要遵守它，而敎授們更要遵守它，它就是這個團體的紀律。所以「大學生活」，問接說，就是積極的大學訓導。杜威嘗言：「生活　敎育；敎育即生活」。生活做錯了，敎育也就錯了。因之，大學訓導的積極作川就是指導怎樣過「大學生活」。對於這個問題，常代敎育家們應該費心去切實考慮，絕非熒句抽象的話就可概括得了的。舉如大學生的意識形態和生活方式，以及師生間的協調，在在都要有個很具體而又很自然的啓示。使得每個靑年方踏入大學之門，就能欣然接受這一番新生活的陶冶，以至變成他生活上不　或離的習慣。這樣接受了四年高等敎育的大學畢業生，離川校門，庶幾才是爲國家添了一個有活力的新細胞。</p>
<p>再談到大學訓導實施的技術問題，不單是執行與受導者雙方的問題，而是一校全體的問題。所謂「訓導」，應該是全校上下一致遵行的事，誰不奉行，誰就是全體共棄的敗類。這樣共信共行，習以爲常，自可成爲大家所共守的生活習慣。因之，一校所有訓導設旅，不但要給學生暸解，更應該給每一位敎職員全盤知道，俾能隨時隨地，使自覺自動的對學生宣導。並不要他們特別抽出時間，去協助「訓導」，只要他們能在言行一致中，都能保持着「訓導」的意義。這樣「訓導」與「生活」打成一片，敎與訓合在一起，潛移默化，使得每個大學生在不知不覺中走上正規。</p>
<p>訓導的責任</p>
<p>我想自由主義的大學敎育必要有自治精神的大學訓導才能配合起來。但像今日一般大學　　將全盤訓導的責任放在一個訓導處裏幾位訓導人員的身上，而使一般敎職員們都變爲局外無關的旁觀者，以致敎歸敎，訓由訓，各自爲政。雖然各大學爲彌補這個缺陷，已設有學生導師制，但因受環境與事實的阻碍，結果仍然等於　設。最後我對今日大學訓導再提供兩個實施的原則：</p>
<p>「提倡敎訓合一」，</p>
<p>「實行生活訓導」。</p>
<p>我所提的「敎訓合一」，並不長將一個學裏敎訓兩處形式合併，而是寄「訓」於「敎」，使一般敎授們除敎書而外，還不要忘記「爲人師表」，應該誨人不倦。其次所謂「生活敎導」，就是具有「示範」作用的敎授　，生活要能與學生生活融合，以實行「身」「心」一致的敎導，打破過去一切言行不符的空泛的訓導方式。所謂身敎者，就是有形的敎導；心敎者，就是無形的敎導。有形的敎導，凡爲人師者，應該「以身作則」，事事能在前領導，樣樣能做學生的榜樣；無形的敎導，就是每個敎授，不但要能做「行」的南針，並且要能「言」「行」一致，能講能行，說到做到，才配　爲「良師」。</p>
<p>請敎授協助</p>
<p>然而我們要想實踐這個普遍的「生活訓導」，不是單靠一校訓導人員的努力，必賴全體敎授協訓助導，羣策羣力，始可奏效。所以提倡「敎訓合一」，確是實施「生活訓導」的前奏。我們從近年部令各大學將「倫理學」改爲學生共同必修科目的意義上看，便可了解今日敎育當局對於「敎訓合一」，已在逐漸加强了。但是檢討今日大學學程裏所設最有關學生思想行爲的「倫理學」與「黨義」，並沒有收到預期的效果。推究其因，一校「訓導實施」與「倫理學」及「黨義」的教授，各行其事，素無聯繫。以致「理論」與「實踐」，不但不能配合，且甚至有抵觸背謬者。這樣「知」「行」不能合一的訓導，怎能呌人心悅誠服呢？我們所認爲理想的大學訓導，就是「理論」與「實踐」要能一致；我們所談到大學訓道實施的技術，就是「理論」與「實踐」要能配合。（完）</p>

<p>五，出口商如不履行按月結售出口匯票條件，貸款行局得按政府出口物資收購辦法，照貸款佔價收購押品，即以收購之價款，淸償貸款本息。</p>

<h3>絲綢價均回瀉</h3>
<p>人造絲昨市直綫下降，一二〇號　字有光，上午開盤即期價爲二億二千四百萬元，隔日期二千九百五十萬元，賣多於買，喊價頻降。午收隔日期做一千七百萬元，下午續吿下瀉，由一千五百萬元挫至二億〇六百萬元賣出價，較上日跌落二千七百萬元。</p>
<p>廠經昨巿亦告低回，上午Ｃ字等級有成交，價做二億九千萬元，高零担八千五百萬元，均係即期票，千經高零担，喊價在二億四千萬元左右，並未做開。下午因人造絲銳落，人心漸虛，交易甚少，各級喊價，均比上午稍露軟意。</p>
<h3>銀根雖緊　産價報升　白粳又見新高價</h3>
<p>米市前日雖見小回，乃屬曇花一現，昨北市塲白粳又高至三百八十八萬元，特高粳見三百九十八萬元新高價，距四百萬大關僅二萬元之差。各較上日猛漲十萬及十二萬元。蒲稻爲三百八十萬元，羊秈高貨以三百九十萬成交，高於上日十萬元。其他如秈米陰白元，各加約十萬元。南市場巿勢，早巿上升最力，白粳早開爲三百八十五萬，提高達廿萬元。薄稻等均同，惟因銀根緊俏，及戶口米之影響，鈉路奇淡，乃吿回下。白粳終做三百七十五萬，薄稻同價，升十萬及五萬元。昨日之上漲，實仍因無錫挺升之故。又業外各物之猛升，亦爲上漲之一原因也。昨到貨南市二千五百十四石，北市六千八百〇二石，合計九千三百十六石。</p>
<h3>呢絨交易清淡　凡立頂市貨充斥</h3>
<p>昨巡視茶會上，呢羢蔓批交易不多。棋盤街門莊零剪，生意亦見淸淡。各區男女服奘店，現定衣着均有限。蓋在高物價下，購買力莫不相繼减弱矣。凡立頂呢最近來續見上巿，頭號每碼喊沽二百五六十萬元，二號二百一二十萬元，三號一百六七十萬元。條子素色，花樣衆多，實地成交無幾，因大小各廠出品充斥，托怡和廠整理者，堆積如山。現定籌碼旣夥，賣買雙方人心虛畏，大半均採從緩　進之意，以免徒耗利息云。</p>
<h3>統債續漲　外股步降</h3>
<p>公債昨再創新高價，過程穩定逾恒，成交增至六百餘萬。統丙盛開一二萬，盤升至一三萬，而後稍定。五五五室五〇〇室六一四室均進，五〇三室五五二室及承德則出。較前收計甲乙戊各升四千元，統丙漲起八千元，統丁升七千元。</p>
<p>外股昨跌風驟起，所降甚多。證券帮及廣帮紛紛　多，洋商納胃大减，除英　華及電話所跌尙微外，均見無力。怡紗晨開一九〇萬，自一九一萬起，步降至一七三萬左右而止。較前收計航業跌二成，怡紗業廣怡　鋼業藍格志各跌一成及成半，英聯會德豐跌半成，電話英　　　挫。</p>
<h3>自備外匯到埠貨物中　鍍鋅鐵絲　不準重運出口　收購期限延長</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕收購無證自備外匯到埠貨物審議會，於十一日舉行例會，以自備外匯到埠及已裝運之鍍鋅鐵絲，前曾由中信局以無字第十一號公吿由該局代政府收購，不准重運出口，惟因此項鐵絲原發票對鐵絲號數每不註明，且英美標準不「，輸出入管理委員會在核發輸入許可證時，殊難事先聲明，經決定爲便利簽發許可證及收購工作之進行起見，所有自備外匯到埠稅則第二○五號鍍鋅鐵絲，應不分號數，一律不准重運出口，統由中信局先代政府收購後將副提單·發票等交國防部派口前往倉庫實地檢查貨品，就需要領用，不合者仍交該局照章由原定貨之直接用戶優先承購，並爲便利進口商申請收購起見，將收購期限予以延長，即自二月十四該局無字第十一號公吿之日起，以七十天爲收購限期，各原進口商應在此限期內迅依規定程序向輸管會輸入限額分配處申請收購。</p>
<h3>多頭全部出籠　華股逐步回跌</h3>
<p>華股昨俏後驟回，泰半時間在疲態中過去。證券帮中多頭全部出籠，圈外刺激大减，暗息增至三角以外，逐步回跌，臨收以低價結束。</p>
<p>晨開時以報載四聯總處舉辦生產貸款之訊而見昂，永紗以五一〇〇元及一六〇〇元之價上塲，開後升爲一五〇八元及一六〇三元。銀根大緊，暗息昂至三角半，證劵帮紛紛斬多，除信誼漲停外，都見回落，中間雖時有升降，無奈散多迫於時間，業中又不加襯托，近午退至一四二〇元及一五二三元低價。午收爲一四三二元及一五三二元。結果較前收即交股除信誼漲停，，永紗華新中絲微降，內衣中紡永公各低一成迄成半不等，餘均跌半成左右。遞交股美亞信和跌半成，餘均跌落少許。</p>
<p>後巿自一四五〇元及一五三〇元起，又被逐步賣到一四二〇元及一五〇五元。夜報均有援華加緊之訊，又退至一四一二元及一四九〇元。一九〇號一八三號雖進，一四五號七一號一五四號仍售，再退至一四〇八元及一四九〇元低價。收市爲一四一〇元及一四九三元。除信誼仍站漲停外，均吿下落。較晨收即交股計信誼漲停，火柴景綸平平，中紡內衣微升，餘均微挫。遞交股華豐跌半成，餘均微降。塲外各未上巿股票仍吿穩定，交通華商南洋大生冠生園等各昂半成。</p>
<h3>中央銀行發　取締金鈔獎金</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕頃自中央銀行獲悉：上海方而取締金鈔非法買賣，凡經軍警機關破獲，將實物移送該行保管，並確定沒收處分後，即由該行墊發緝獲機關及吿密人獎金。實施以來，對獎　告密，頗收實效。茲關於天津漢口廣州及共他等地取締金鈔非法買賣之應給獎金，亦准援照上海巿例，由該行　發云。</p>
<h3>茶行電請四聯　指撥毛茶貸款</h3>
<p>本市茶行商業同業公會，爲申請毛茶貸款昨特電呈南京四聯總處，略謂該會同業以採購運銷茶葉爲業務，每届茶季，紛往產區設莊採購。所收茶業，除供應內銷外，並以毛茶原料供給申地三十餘家製茶廠，製成箱茶輸出。即以去年而論，輸出箱茶總額廿六萬餘市擔，其中得自貸款者半數，其原料一部份即由茶行供給。故茶行·製茶·輸出三業，實唇齒相依。該會同業，前年曾蒙四聯總處貸款，得以發揮收購成效。去年則以申請較遲，奉示茶貸已逐步結束，　難照辦等語。按茶葉生產，最富伸縮性，收購者愈多，茶農興趣高，而生產亦愈多。倘得海外暢銷，茶行毛茶，可悉舉以供出口原料。邇者，本年新茶，瞬將登塲，如何貸款以勵增產，定在總處統籌規　之中。惟是產區工資高昂，毛茶成本激增，以茶商資力，勢難展開收購工作。爲此擬請依照往年成例，就整個茶貸項下，指撥毛茶貸款若干，以供該會六十餘家會員收購箱茶原料之需云。</p>
<h3>紗布漲風稍戢　喊價均告下游</h3>
<p>昨日棉紗巿况，晨開時因外埠行情報升本客兩帮納意仍濃，喊價堅穩。旋以業內外銀根緊迫，更逢紡建公司配紗之期，且連日漲風過暴，價站高峯，人心忐忑，浮戶細於頭寸者，首先乘高出檔，市氣頓告松弛，各方均止進轉出　，空方趁勢活動，客胃亦呈呆鈍一，獲利多頭紛紛吐售，喊價漸吿一下游。迨至最後四十二支藍鳳細一紗低價以一億七千七百萬元收市，較之上日回跌三百萬元。賓光金城兩牌亦瀉三四百萬元，廿支各檔，因客帮見低有吸，微挫五十萬至一百餘萬。其他十支十六支及卅二支等粗細紗，亦均回降一百四五十萬至二三百萬元不等</p>
<p>棉布巿况初開時，散戶進提尙勁，大戶亦有少數收取，價又挺升。龍頭細布竟猛竄至四百萬大關，旋因漢口帮及北帮對現貨套出甚多，同時浮戶見去化轉滯，賣出亦夥。且紡建公司有大量籌碼開出，同業銀根軋緊，布商以價高思危，競相拋售。客帮均抱觀望，塲內一片喊賣之聲，行情始吿下游。十二磅龍頭細布直瀉至三百七十三萬元收市，但比之上日仍軋升一萬元。五福陽鶴兩　，亦好二·五萬元。共他藍鶴彩球，升沉互見。此外粗布漂布細斜及色布去化尙活，巿尙挺秀·士林布因廠家供應不充，步升三四十萬至六七十萬元。其餘嗶嘰直貢納夫妥等，則趨疲憊狀態</p>
<h3>火油洋燭迭升</h3>
<p>火油巿面，因受港電一再報縮影響，並　同業批發交易頗繁，市勢賡續上展·高度桶貨做一千六七百萬元，美孚及亞細亞聽油挺升至二百萬元，零沽每提增至四萬五千元，限偎每斤仍爲二萬五千元。</p>
<p>洋燭以原料油脂貨稀價昂，成本增加，且走銷不弱，業外亦有收吸，致行情迭升不已。白禮氏船牌批發每箱做高至二百七十萬元，僧帽二百八十萬元，鷄牌二百萬，駱駝紅福等一百七八十萬元。</p>
<p>油脂上漲</p>
<p>工業繁　之油脂，因工商輔導處，將四區肥皂工業廠商等四季之油脂蠟類配額予以减少，致原料供應缺乏，皂業大起恐慌，該業以牛油原料需要甚殷，除由公會備文向當局申訴外，另向市塲搜求，吸納甚强，喊價以靑島及蚱埠來貨不繼，市存薄弱，牛油高價見一千五百萬元，近午做四百萬。椰子油每担狂竄至二千四百萬，柏汕禾本一千一百萬，拆雪及蘭油等一千〇三五十萬元，各油續升有一二成之譜。</p>
<p>國藥步升</p>
<p>自運費增加後，國藥一再上升。一號老揀香，竟創新高價，爲七十萬元。泰昌藿香，廿四萬元，淸甲片廿六萬元。撫極芎十二萬元，芎王十一萬元，刁芎十萬元，生地八萬五千元，津防楓十八萬元，漲勢頗勁。俱因匯水波動，運費增加，外匯提高所致云。</p>
<h3>臺幣匯率提升　一比一八九元</h3>
<p>〔中央社台北十二日電〕合幣與法幣匯率十二日起，提升爲一比一八九元。</p>
<h3>中農將召集分支行會議　商討推動農貸計劃</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕自本年度農業及土地金融貸款總額計十五萬億元，於十一日由四聯總處理事會正式通過後，參加出席該會議之中國農民銀行總經理李叔明氏，已於十二日晨由京返滬。據李氏談稱：今後農行工作推動之重心及經濟前途，注重農業增產，運用有效方法，使資金直達農民之手。並對農貸方法，作更進一步之改善，以期妥善。其實施步驟，日內即召集全國各地分支行經理及管理農貸人員會議，公佈本行業已擬定之推動計劃，並採納意見，作有系統之商討，以資貫澈任務，而收宏效。李氏對農貸實施後，是否影響市面一點。則强調此項貸款，須分月分省舉行，時問較久，地區遼闊，實際獲得者，必爲農村，自與市塲隔絕。即農貸旺季，每月不過約三萬億。最後渠並追溯此項計劃之草擬，係於去年十一月份開始，經十餘次修正，方吿脫稿。內容之重要點，包括實施期間，顧及國行頭寸之供應，及如何使農民身受實惠等等。</p>
<h3>防止進出口走私　中澳協定今日實施　輸管會公告七纇貨物　進出口須呈驗證明書</h3>
<p>據中央銀行發言人吿稱，自中港金融協定訂立以後，中央銀行代表與澳門政府已完成協商，雙方本合作及善意之精神，經過慎重及精密之商討後，同意實施下列與中港協定相類似之辦法。自本日起，我國主要出口貨如銻，猪鬃，棉紗，，茶葉，錫，鎢及多種植物油，包括桐油，菜油在內，運澳轉口，須呈繳證明書，證明該貨由中國出口所得之外匯，業經售結或訂明將售結與中國境內之指定銀行。否則澳門政府不准轉運出口。自同日起，貨物由澳運至中國，如其價値超過葡幣二百元，或其等値者，必須先呈臉我國輸出入管理委員會簽發之輸入許可證，否則澳門政府不准其出口。澳門政府並禁止携帶國幣五百萬元以上之現鈔進山，此舉與中國及香港政府現行限制裝運現鈔辦法相同。上列辦法，對於中國外匯及進出口貿易之管理，均爲有價値之幫助，使中港金融協定之實施，更臻嚴密，藉此中國政府可防制由於出口走私所蒙外匯之損失。</p>
<p>輸出入管理委員會昨爲中澳協定發出第二十五號及二十六號公吿如下：查我國與澳門當局業經商定自民國卅七年三月十三日起，（一）銻（二）猪鬃（三）棉紗（四）茶葉（五）錫（六）鎢砂以及（七）各種植物油（即桐油菜油桂皮油八角油，萆　油棉籽油蔴籽油胡蔴籽油蘇籽油茶油）等七類貨物，由澳門複出口轉口或轉運者，須向澳門當局呈繳（C.BC.8a修正式）證明書，證明該貨由我國裝遝澳門所得之外匯已售結或訂明將售結與在國內之指定銀行。出口商今後由國內裝運上列貨物至澳門或由澳門轉口均須塡繳「C.B.C.8a修正式」證明書一式五份，俟在國內之指定銀行簽證後，仍照向例手續呈送海關，以一份由海關蓋章退還原申請人存執，隨貨裝運至澳門，呈由拱北關稅務司查核。如該貨將來須由澳門轉運出口時，並應呈送澳門當局查驗。</p>
<p>「查我國與澳門常局業經商定，凡由澳門裝運我國境內之貨物，其價値超過二百澳門幣（或相等幣値）以上者，必須先向澳門當局呈驗本會對於該貨所簽發之輸入許可證正本，否則澳門當局均不予放行。上項規定之必要手續辦理完畢後，其輸入許可證之正本，即由澳門當局發還出口商。</p>

<h3>試考水經注寫成的年歲</h3>
<p>— 胡適</p>
<p>水經注的作者　道元死在拓拔魏孝　三年（西曆五二七），即梁武帝大通元年。水經注成書不知在何年，但書中有時提及作者同時的史事與人物。這種材料應該可以帮助我們考定　道元著書的年歲。不料舊時學者反倒懷疑這種同時史實，說他是後人　進去的．何焯趙一淸諸公都曾有這種懷疑，其實都是他們自已偶然考證錯了。</p>
<p>例如水經注卷廿八引吳均的劍　詩一句。何焯說：</p>
<p>「道元與吳均同時，安得引用其詩？疑此書後人附益者多矣。」趙一淸水經汴釋（二十八，葉二）說：</p>
<p>「按南史吳均傳，天監初，柳惲爲吳興，召補主薄·當道元之時，均名位尙輕，文字未必遂行江外。義門之言可謂精審矣。」</p>
<p>這兩條考證都不算「精審」。梁書吳均傳記他死在梁武帝普通元年（五二〇），年五十二，那是在酈道元死之前七年。梁　南史都說吳均的詩在當時「好事者或效之，謂爲吳均體」·可見他的詩很流行。當時南北朝的文籍互相流通很容易，故水經注裏常引沈約的宋書，又引王智深的宋史（卷廿五）·史籍尙可流傳江外，何况詩歌？故酈氏引吳均的詩句，毫不足奇怪。</p>
<p>又如水經注卷二十八居巢縣下注文有「趙祖　城」，又有「胡景城」。趙一淸水經注箋刊誤十，葉廿五說「胡　城」應該是「胡景　城一。又說：</p>
<p>「梁天監四年侵魏合肥。胡景　與趙祖悅同軍交惡，而韋　解之·事見南　史　傳。然有大可疑者。梁天監四年是　孝昌元年。明年道元被害於陰槃。其成書又知在何時。安得據取胡趙築城以相證？……此與……引吳均詩同一蔽也。</p>
<p>這一段有三大錯。（一）梁天監四年是西曆五〇五，魏孝昌元年是西曆五二五，相去二十年，怎麼可說天監四年就是孝昌元年！（二）酈道元死在孝昌三年（五二七），不能說是「明年」。（三）趙　悅胡景略　城不知確在何年。如果築城　　大監四年，那就是道元死之前二十二年。水經注提到這些地名，也毫不足奇怪。</p>
<p>又如水經注卷三十二注文有江夏惠懷縣」，趙一淸說：</p>
<p>「按隋書地理志，梁置　沔陽，營陽，州城三郡，及州陵，惠　二縣。……道元卒于孝昌二年，上距兩天　元年僅五年耳。其成書不知在何時，而遽稱江表新朝之建乎？此　後人所增入，與沔水注引吳均詩可互證也。」（水經注釋三十二，葉十五）</p>
<p>這裏又有三大錯。（一）道元死在孝昌三年，不是二年，說已見前。（二）天監元年（五〇二）杜孝昌三年之前二十五年，並非相去僅五年！（三）趙氏偶然誤引了隋書地理志，而沒有比勘更早的諸史。如宋書州郡志郢州刺史下，就有</p>
<p>江夏太守</p>
<p>惠　十相，江左之。</p>
<p>巴陵太守</p>
<p>州陵　相，漢舊縣。</p>
<p>又如南　書州郡志郢州的江夏郡有惠　縣，巴陵郡有州陵縣。故　道元提及惠陵縣，毫不足奇怪．</p>
<p>我現在要指出水經注記載的最晚的歷史事實，使大家知道酈道元這部不朽的大著作的寫定大概已在作者晚年，離他死時大概不遠，—也許他被害時這書還沒有完全寫定呢。</p>
<p>酈道元在他　裏往往吿訴我們一些關於他自己的傳記材料。例如他在汝水篇說：</p>
<p>「余以延昌四年蒙除東荆州</p>
<p>刺史」。</p>
<p>延昌四年等　天監十四年（五一五），距道元死時，止有十二年了。</p>
<p>水經注卷廿六沭水篇：</p>
<p>「沭水又南，逕建陵山西。魏正光中，齊王之鎭徐州也，立大堨，遏水西流。兩瀆之曾，置城防之，　曲沭戍。自堨流三十里，西注沭水舊瀆，謂之新渠．」這裏「建陵山」舊本作「陵山」，「正光」作「正完」。趙載兩本都改作「建陵山」「正光」·趙氏朱箋刊誤九，葉卅五云：</p>
<p>「此是拓跋魏孝明帝正光年中事也。齊王即蕭寰筑·魏書蕭賓　傳云：『神龜中（五一八至五一九）出爲都　　徐南兗二州諸軍事，車騎將軍，徐州刺史。……正光二年（五二一）徵　　騎大將車。　」蕭　　傳　也說起立堨的事，但不在正光時。傳文說：</p>
<p>「靈太后臨朝（正昌四年，即　天　十四年，五一五），〔　　〕還京師。蕭衍（梁武帝）　其將康絢　浮山堰淮，以灌揚徐。除賓夤使持節，都　　東討諸軍事，鎭　將　，以討之。熈平初，城　旣成，淮水濫溢，將爲　　之患．賓　於堰上流更　新渠，引　淮澤，水乃小减。</p>
<p>據梁書康　傳，浮山堰的工程開始在天監十二年（魏延昌三年，五一四），到天監十五年四月（魏熈平元年，五一六）才造成。那年「秋八刀，淮水暴長，　悉壞決，奔流　海。」</p>
<p>魏書九，孝明帝記　的　分明二</p>
<p>「延昌四年（五一五）正月，孝明帝即位。九月皇太后親　　　機。九月癸亥，詔……冀州刺史蕭賓　爲鎭東將軍，次淮堰。</p>
<p>熈平元年（五一六）二月乙已，鎭東蕭賓夤大　蕭衍將於淮北。……九月丁丑，淮堰破，蕭衍緣淮城戍村落十餘萬口皆漂入於海。」道元是同時的證見，又是地理學者，故我們應該相信他的記載，訂定蕭賓　作堰不在　山堰　壞之前，而在其後；其事是在「正光中，齊工之鎭徐州，約在正光元年（五二〇）。　是水經注　最晚的一件史事。七年之後，　道元就被害死了。</p>
<p>蕭　　殺害　道元全家，是在孝昌三年（五二七）。水經注淮水篇設浮山堰事：</p>
<p>「淮水又東，逕浮山，山北對巉石山。梁　天　中，立堰於二山之間，　天地之心，乖民神之望，自然水　壞矣·」</p>
<p>此事在躑氏死之前十一年。水經注沭水篇記「正光中，齊王之鎭徐州」，此事在　氏死之前六七年，酈氏把這兩件事記得很分明。魏書把相隔四五年的兩件事誤記在同一個時期了。</p>
<p>水經注卷三十五，注云：</p>
<p>「舉水出龜頭山，西北流逕　籠戍南，梁定州治，蠻出超秀爲刺史。……舉水又西南，逕梁司豫二州東，蠻魯魯生爲　史，治湖陂城，亦謂之水城也。」</p>
<p>按梁書廿二，安成王秀傳，天監十三年（五一四），秀爲使特節，散騎常侍，都督郢司霍三州諸軍事，安西將軍，郢州刺史。傳　說：</p>
<p>「時司州叛蠻　魯　，弟魯賢，超秀據　來降。高祖以魯生爲北司州刺史，魯賢北豫州刺史，超秀定州刺史，爲北境捍蔽。而魯生超秀互相纔毀，有去就心。秀（蕭秀）撫　懷納，各得其用，常時賴之。」魏書九，孝明帝紀，延昌四年（即天　十四年，五一五）有這一條：</p>
<p>「八月……庚辰，蕭衍定州刺史出超秀　衆三千請降。」</p>
<p>這就是梁書說的「有去就心」。田魯生兄弟歸降　　，作三州刺史，是酈道元死之前十二三年的事。</p>
<p>酈道元一生最閑暇的時期，好像是地從東荆州刺史任上還京被免官，到他做河南尹的時期。他做東荆州是在延昌四年（五一五）；他做河南　，據北周書趙肅傳，是在正光五年（五二四）。水經注裏沒有在正光初年以後的史事。也許這部大書是他免官之後，起復之前，發憤寫成的。（卅七，三，四夜改稿）</p>

<p>宋寗宗嘉泰四年（西曆一二〇四年），正是韓侂　當權的時代。爲了鞏固其在朝廷上的權勢，韓氏頗想發動對外的戰爭，希圖建立一番功業·這時候，南宋立國於江左已經七十餘年，軍事力量始終不足以抵　外族其　當孝宗即位之初，本是有意於恢復之業的，但在隆興元年（一一六三）張浚李顯忠等人被金人大敗於苻離之後，舉國上下　全不敢再提議對金用兵的事，從此士氣日以銷沉，社曾風習也日益萎靡。由孝宗隆興到寗宗嘉泰，蹉跎因循，爲時也已三十年以上，一般奮發有爲，志切恢復的人，長時期處在這種低沉的氣壓之下，實在不勝其躁急苦悶，巴不得操持軍政大權的人出而把局勢改換一下，旣然知道韓侂胄躍躍欲試，遂也大都樂意與之同心協力，趨赴事功，以期民族　恨稍得伸雪，個人的鬱悶，情懷也稍得發抒。那時候的公私記載當中（如慶元黨禁和建炎以來朝野　　記諸書），都載　稼軒於嘉泰四年過關入見寗宗，陳用兵之利，並且說金國必亂必亡，願付之元老大臣，務爲倉猝可以應變之計。稼軒之所以這樣積極主張對金用兵，必即出於如上所述的那種心情的。</p>
<p>稼軒的這項建議，因爲是在適當的時機之下提出的，遂乃發生了極大的效果，據史書所載，韓侂　　之大喜，遂決意出兵向金人挑戰。</p>
<p>在過闕入見之前，稼軒是以紹興知府而兼任浙江東路安撫使的，入見之後不久，便改爲鎭江府的知府，其更　的用意，想是如當時劉致稼軒的賀啓所說：「眷惟京口，實　邊頭」之故。</p>
<p>常赴任鎭江之先，稼軒的「官」階剛由朝請大夫轉爲朝議大夫，他的貼職，也剛由集英殿修撰進　賓　閣待制。這一年稼軒已是六十五歲的人了。</p>
<p>嘉泰四年三月稼軒到鎭江去上任，過了整整一年，到開禧元年（一二〇五）三月，因爲所薦非人的一件事，稼軒竟至「坐謬舉」而降了兩官，即由朝議大夫降爲朝散大夫了·（宋制：朝議大夫之下爲朝請大夫，朝請大夫之下爲朝散大夫）。爲</p>
<p>宋史稼軒本傳中對於這件事情的記載很簡略，只有「坐謬舉降朝散大夫」八個字，不能使我們知道究竟是怎樣的一件事。在徐松輯本宋會要黜降第十一記及比　云：</p>
<p>〔開禧元年〕三月二日，　謨閣待制知鎭江府辛棄疾降兩官，以通直郎張　不法，棄疾坐謬舉之責也。這里所記的雖稍微詳細了些，而張　究竟做了何等不洗事體，致便當時極爲朝廷上所倚重的人物如稼軒者也竟受到責罰，却依然無法知道。特別爲我們所要知道的，是稼軒這次降了兩官之後，究竟又敍復了原官沒有？這一問題，在宋史，宋會要，以及宋人所有的雜史和筆記當中，全都不能找得一偶答案出來。因而當我寫「辛稼軒年譜」的時候（此書雖新近才由商務印　館出版，却是我十年前的舊作）．對這問題便未予解答。近日得讀蔡幼學（行之）的育德堂外制集，才發現這問題的答案，知道稼軒後來又敍復了朝議大夫，而前後的幾道制命，全是出於蔡幼學的手筆的。</p>
<p>今將與稼軒復官　關的兩道制詞抄錄於後，並稍稍推者其年月。</p>
<p>一，辛棄疾敍朝請大夫：「推賢達能，士之素志；失舉連坐，國之舊章。法雖必行，情或可亮。具官某夙　　，自許攻名，被器使於　期，縣　宣於數路。更事旣久，閱人亦多。胡決　、之未精，以薦揚而自累？爰因　宥，浸　前官。觀過知仁，朕豈追尤於旣往；惟善舉類，卿其益謹於將來』。　（育德堂外制卷一，葉二）。</p>
<p>這制詞是編置在「吳揔落　謨閣直學士」的制詞之後，「程松　州安置」的制詞之前。吳揔之所以落　謨閣直學士，是因爲吳曦叛變的關係，宋會要刑法門（六）載：</p>
<p>〔開禧三年三月〕廿七日四川都大茶馬吳揔言：「逆賊吳曦，不　臣節，上負國恩，下　家世，臣與　室，罪當萬坐，謹同男昭等伏闕待罪。」詔吳揔落職放罪。</p>
<p>蔡氏的制詞當中有「屬大憝之就誅，瀝忱誠結引咎」等語，，正是針對吳揔自請處分的奏　而說的，可知這制詞就是在三月廿七日行下的。另據宋史寗宗本紀，程松是在開禧三年三月壬寅責授順昌軍節度副使澧州安置的，是年三月朔日爲丙子，壬寅也正是廿七日。稼軒叙復朝請大夫的制詞旣介居於二者之間，可知其與上二事必是在同一天內。</p>
<p>二，辛棄疾叙朝議大夫：「侍從之臣，朕所望以汲引人物，共濟事功，然人之難知或至於失舉，而其心可察也。具官某材高一世，名在累朝，方乍去於論思，固尙深於簡注。乃以微累，未復前階，甄滌之常，朕亦何吝。爾其勉思報國，益務進賢，毋懲創於一人，而自沮其推轂之志，斯朕之所以望爾者，尙念之哉·（育德堂外制券一，葉十二。）」</p>
<p>這制詞編置在一趙淳江淮制置使」的制詞之後，「項安世落直龍岡閣」的制詞之前。今查宋史寗宗紀，以趙淳爲殿前副都指揮使兼江淮制置使，乃開禧三年九月辛卯日事；而項安世之落直龍圖閣，宋會要黜降官十一謂在是年　月廿二日。宋史與會要此兩條記事均明確無可疑，因而我認爲育德堂外制中這幾道制詞的排列，必有顚倒失序之處。今姑依項安世落職的時日以定稼軒叙復朝議大夫的時日，則最晚也當是七月廿二日。是年八月稼軒已在家得了病，九月初十日即逝世，他是否曾在病榻上看到這項詔命，我們是無從考知的了。</p>
<p>爲了張　的不法事件，稼軒雖降了兩官，却依舊在作鎭江的知府而未被罷免，他的貼職，也還照舊是　待制。開禧元年六月十九日改知隆興府，未　到任，即因遭受到　官的論列，罷免了新任而改爲「提舉冲佑觀」，遂於秋間歸鉛山家居。</p>
<p>宋史稼　傳於「提舉冲佑觀」之下，接　「差知紹興府，兩浙東路安撫，辭免。進　文閣待制，　進　圖　。知江　府，令赴行在　于事，試兵部侍郎，辭免。」雖則這幾次所差授的任務稼軒全都沒有到任，却也可見朝廷上對於他還是倚仗　股，所以他的職名也次第而進爲龍圖閣待制了。然而就在這樣倚重他的時候，對於他所降的兩官却遲遲不予叙復，這究竟是因爲張　所犯的不法之罪太重大呢，抑是因爲宋代士人只「以登臺閣，升禁從爲顯宦，而不以官之遲速爲榮滯」，而朝堂中人也懷了這樣的觀念，遂把稼軒復官的事認爲無足輕重而致遲誤如是其久的呢？這問題我們也是無從解答的。</p>
<p>在育德堂外制中還有一道「辛棄疾待制致　」的制詞，其時間是更在以後了．今也抄在這里：</p>
<p>「下賜環之詔，正切須材；慕埀車之榮，據聞謝事。勉從忱悃，載錫寵章。具官某蘊識疏明，臨機果毅，功名自許，早已負於奇材；險阻備嘗，晚益堅於壯志。事我烈祖，逮於冲人，疇其外庸，登之法從。顧蹄休之未久，曾眷注之不忘。念熟贊於邊籌，俾入承於密旨。胡然抱病，返此乞身。即次對之舊班，疏文階之新渥，以崇禮貌，以責丘園。無競維人，方緬懷於故老；勿藥有喜，尙永介於壽祺。」（卷三，葉十。）</p>
<p>這制詞編置在「趙善宣知臨安府」的制詞之後，「趙師　知鎭江府」的制詞之前。咸淳臨安志秩官門載趙善宣於開禧三年十二月二十六日以叙朝請大夫工部郎中除直華文閣權知臨安府事；嘉定鎭江志宋代太守門載趙師　於嘉定元年·（一二〇八）正月初五日到任。稼軒的致仕　介居於二者之間，藉知其事若不在開禧三年的歲杪，便在嘉定元年的歲初，於時稼軒逝世已逾百日了·大槪是稼軒於病重時候曾上表陳乞致　，表文送達朝廷之時，也許已在稼軒逝世之後，中間再經過一番「公文旅行」的長久過程，遂不免遲延到三四個月的時光了。</p>

<h3>論南傅大藏經的翻譯</h3>
<p>— 季羡林</p>
<p>前　天一位朋友從上海寄給我六册普　大藏經刋行會印的南傳大藏經。其中兩　是　部經典，原名Dighanikaya，相　中譯大藏裏而的長阿　經（Dirghagama）。譯者江　百，是根據日譯本市譯的。一册是中部經典，原名Majjhimaikaya，相當中譯大藏經　面的中阿含經（Madhyamagama）。譯者沙門芝峯，也是根據日譯本市譯的。兩册是小部經典（Khuddakanikaya）裏的本生經（Joaka）。譯者夏丐尊，也是根據日譯本市譯的。最後一册是論部（Abhidammapitaka）的發趣論（Patthanapakarana或Mfahapakrana），論題雖然同北傳的發智論（火正藏一五四四）相似；但內容同形式都不一樣。譯者范寄東，仍然是根據日譯本軍譯的。據說普　一大藏經刋行會原來的計劃是把全部的南傳大藏經都從“譯本市譯過來；不過因爲種種原因，這偉大的計劃到現在只實現了很小很小一部分：印出來的書似乎就只有這六册。出來的書雖然不多；但這計劃是很有意義的，只是這勇氣就値得我們佩服。對這書的出版我在欽佩之餘還有點意見，現在就拉雜寫在下面。</p>
<p>我們先談「南傳」這兩個字。所謂「南」者是對「北」而言。「北」是指的梵文或混合文的大藏經。「南」就是指的巴利文的大藏經。不但我們中國學者這樣分，連外國學者也一樣。現在的巴利文大藏經的確琉行在南方的錫蘭島上，述暹羅字母的大藏經也是從錫蘭島流傳過去的。我們似乎沒有理由來否認「南傳」兩個字的正確性·但倘若我們回到歷史面硏究一下巴利文大藏經流佈的情形，我們立刻就會覺得「南傳」這兩個字有問題了。先說巴利文就不是南部的方言。巴利文的成因非常複雜，我們現在還不敢說已經把與巴利文有關的　　學上的問題都解決了；但大體我們總可以說，巴利文是一個西部的方言，因爲有許多文法上的特點都同阿育王碑刻裏的（Giroar）方言相似　學者由碑刻方面著手硏究的結果也可以證明巴利文的老家是在Vindhya山脈中部至西部一帶地方。裏面雖然有不少東部方言的痕迹；但這都是從原始的摩揭陀文（Magadhi）的經典裏保留下來的。這樣一部西部方　經典怎樣會流到南方的錫蘭島去呢？我們沒有歷史的材料作根據來解釋這事情，我們只好乞靈於傳說·據傳說阿育王的弟弟或兒子Mahinda把這部巴利文的大藏經帶到錫蘭島去，而且是從空中飛去的。這樣的傳說我們當然不能信；但這傳說也許可以暗示我們一個歷史事實，就是，這都經是在佛教法大王阿育王時代由到南方去傳敎的高僧帶到錫蘭島去的。不管這部經是怎樣傳過去的，它的老家反正不是南方。所以我覺得「南傳」這兩個字不很妥當，我們應該換一換，或者乾脆就呌做巴利文大藏經。</p>
<p>我們規在再談翻譯的問題·這幾册已經印出來的書都是從日文譯本重譯過來的·我向來就反對重譯，因爲我覺得翻譯已經是不得已的辦法，無論從什麼文字譯成什麼文字，無論譯者的本領怎樣高，原文的風格韻味甚至涵義也不能完全保存在譯文裏，何况是重譯？世界上儘有非常　著名的翻譯，像Fitzgeralcl譯的魯拜集，Shlegl和Tieck的德譯莎士比亞；但倘若仔細硏究起來，這些譯本之所以出名，完全因爲譯文的精美，並不不是因爲　譯文捉住了原文的韻味和風格格。這些譯文實際上就是創作，原文只供給了創作的靈感。現在從日文重譯巴利文大藏經我也不敢贊成。日文同巴利文在句子的構造上相差非常遠。連與巴利文同屬於一個語系的英文德文法文都不能把原文的風格和句子的構造忠實的保留住，何况日文？現在我們隨便舉一個例子：本生經第三十八原名Baka-Jataka（鷺本生），裏面有一首詩，我現在把原文寫在下面：</p>
<p>Naccanta　nikatippannonikatya　sukham　edhati</p>
<p>Aradhe　nikatippanno　bako　kakkata-m-iva＇ti直譯出來就是：</p>
<p>長於奸詐者不能永遠因了奸詐獲得利益，</p>
<p>就像奸詐的鷺從蟹那裏受到的。</p>
<p>意思是，長於奸詐人雖然有時候利用奸詐可以得到好處；但總有一天會受到惡報，奸詐的鷺讓蟹懲罰了一下，就是個例子。原文兩行，每行十六個音節·每行又可以分成兩半（Pada），每個Pada八個音節。第二行文法上有點問題，似乎應該補充一下纔能淸楚。</p>
<p>我們現在來看譯文。我手邊沒有日譯本，只能根據從日譯文市譯過來的中譯文來看：</p>
<p>長於奸詐者以奸詐之故</p>
<p>不能永久　策　如奸詐　因　受到（　　）</p>
<p>每行分成兩段，大槪是要表示出原文的Pada·不過却失敗了，因爲原文的第一第二Pada在這裏變成了三段，最後兩個Pada却縮成一段·再就意義上說似乎也有點錯誤：譯者好像要說，因了奸詐的緣故纔不能永久繁榮，與原文的涵義不符。我們再看英譯本：</p>
<p>Guiile　profits　not　you　very　guileful　folk</p>
<p>Mark　what　the　guilefulcrane　got　from　the　crabf　1這樣譯未免太自由了，無端加添了幾個字都是原文沒有的，口氣也同原文完全不同。英譯本同日譯本比，我看還是日譯本比較忠實於原文·倘若有人從英譯本裏把本生經譯出來，那就恐怕離原文更遠了。</p>
<p>我上面說到第二行似乎有點問題。係這樣有問題的地方在巴利文大藏經還很多，多半是因爲流傳時間過久，難免有傳寫錯誤的地方。就拿本生經來說，裏面就不少間題。Fausboll校刋的本子，固然都公認是一個傑作；但也還留下許多困難問題沒有解決。英國名梵文學家Cuwell領了一大羣梵文學者評成的英文本和Dutrroit譯成的被文本都不能令我們十分滿意，有些地方常常牽强附會。所以無論誰只要想翻譯巴利文經典，就要對原文加以精密的硏究，他的譯文就代表他在巴利文研究上的造詣。在翻譯的時候，除了最通行的、Pali　Text　Society的刋本以外，還應該參閱暹羅字母的大藏經，因爲暹羅字母的大藏經有的時候比通行刋本好，字句有些地方更與古本接近·日本學者雖然已經知道利用遇羅字母的大藏經了，但日本學者對巴利文的硏究成績並不特別出色。以不太出色的成績來作這樣艱鉅的工作，有些地方難免勉强，自然也是意中事了。所以我相信，巴利文大藏經裏面許多字句方面的困難，在日譯本裏不見得都能得到滿意的解決·我們現在竟然想把這樣一部書全部車譯過來，豈不有點費力不討好麽？我們現在在這方面工作的專家還不多，當然還談不到能直接從巴利文裏把全部大藏經譯過來；但是我們不妨先從小處着手，有幾個人算幾個人，能譯多少就譯多少，慢慢加添上去，多少年後，說不定我們也能把全部巴利文大藏經直接譯過來·即便我們目前只能譯出一本來；但道一本也能表示我們眞正的本領，總比重譯外國文譯本好·也許有人會說：這樣一來，我們不知道要等多麽久纔能看到全部巴利文大藏經的譯本。但那又有什麼關係呢？我一直到現在還相信，作學問應該抱定寗闕勿濫的精神。</p>
<p>我上面說了很多話，似乎對普慧大藏經刋行會　印的巴利文大藏經不滿意。其實不然，我非常欽佩這種精神。我只希望中國學者們能够百尺竿頭，　進一步，所以纔說了多話。我的川意是給學者們以鼓勵，讓他們不要浪費精力，如此而已·（三月四日晚於北京大學）</p>

<p>自由談</p>
<h3>談錯覺</h3>
<p>— 史郁</p>
<p>你將食指放在額角上，然後閉着眼搖動你的頭部，你會覺得這是你的手指在動。你透過了折光的玻璃，將一根筆直的棒看成彎曲時，用手摸起來，也會覺得彎曲的。你坐在京滬車的特快車中，若閉着眼背着車行的方向坐，你會覺得車子是在相反的方向進行着。一個眞眞的正方形看起來並不頂方，若闊度稍寬，會更像正方形的。二根等長的直綫，看起來豎放曾較横放更長。</p>
<p>狗對着水中自己的倒影而狂吠；麻雀看着田中的草人而高飛。人類也是這個樣子，我們是生活在錯覺中。地球不息地轉動，但我們却未嘗或覺；江河裘行舟，景物動而船不動，即是這個道理。色盲的人可以將紅色的花看成藍色。善感的人可以將天上的白雲看成蒼狗。舊俄女皇凱塞玲在巡遊西伯利亞時，地方官用紙糊的房子粉飾沿途。女皇歡忻若在，說：「西伯利亞竟這樣的美麗嗎？」女皇生活在錯覺中。</p>
<p>不曉得典從何出，說花生米與豆腐乾同吃有火腿味。但心理學家確曾吿訴我們，說味覺是最容易引起錯覺的。你若捏住你的鼻孔；閉起你的眼睛，則麥其淋與牛油同味，且你休想辨出鷄肉，牛肉，猪肉有什麼異味·你甚至述蕃　湯與洋葱湯也無法辨別。</p>
<p>商人是最恤得利用錯覺的·你在靜安寺路閒步，試　意兩旁橱窗的標價，很少會有整數的·皮鞋店的老闆將一雙皮鞋　「87，975，000」，而不願直捷了當的標「＄2,000,000」·因爲顧客的錯覺，覺得九角九分比一元便宜不至一分。整數足以產生「關」的感覺。米價從二百五十萬漲到二百九十萬，並不若何激動，但當漲至三百零一萬時，我們就跳了起來：一破了三百大關——」</p>
<p>心理學家吿訴我們：我們日常的觀察，幾乎常常是錯誤的。一紙從正面看是方形；從側面看是一綫。我們觀察一般的事物往往只看得事物的一面，而忽視了其他的方面。一個有名的瞎子摸象的故事：說瞎子摸着象的背部，就以爲象是一　牆；摸着象的鼻子，就以爲家是一條蛇；摸着象的腿，就以爲象是一根柱。抽象的東西是最易引起錯覺的。一個孩子在問他的父親：</p>
<p>「什麼呌空氣？」</p>
<p>「空氣是無，無臭，無味，看不見的東西。」</p>
<p>「怎樣無色，無臭，無味呢？」</p>
<p>「與玻璃一樣的無色，與白開水一樣的無臭無味！」</p>
<p>「我曉得了！空氣是玻璃杯一樣的！」</p>
<p>觀察的錯誤是可以部份的歸罪於「情感」的。人們說：「你是太富情感了！「人類的素性，恒將喜愛者估高，討厭者估低。黛　的肺癆在實王看來是一種美麗，黄種人的聰明在白種人看來是一種浪費。你覺得這件事是對的，因爲你崇拜或敬仰的人覺得道件事是對的。當蕭伯納覺得不應該廢除死刑的時候，很多的英國人也就覺得不應該廢除死刑了。古代的執政者假如要吃鳳肝，吃就是了；現代的執政者假如要吃鳳肚，先得製造一套輿論，使人民有「執政者非吃鳳肝不可」的錯誤觀念，然後不得已而食之，正如一個　玩牌的人，能將最後一張「愛司」發給自己，而將人們蒙在鼓裏。</p>
<p>偏見與迷信即是一種錯覺，至少是一種部份的錯覺。星相家爲你的前程祝福　，因爲你生的能眉鳳眼，印當寬闊，準頭豐滿。但假如你生的鮎魚口，扇風耳，或三停不勻，五嶽不豐，你就侖途多舛了。據說看見人家出殯是不吉利的。夢見棺材，在屋子裏打傘，看見水退下去，太陽落下去，或最後的半個月亮，都是不吉利的。婚禮時鳥從敎堂飛走，不祥之兆；生病時狗低頭呌喚，厄運將臨·心理學家曾將此種偏見與迷信硏究過，發覺完全是人類的錯覺。這種錯誤的邏輯往往是因爲某幾件事情偶然的聯想而形成的。我們覺得十三是一個不吉的數字，因爲基督最後一餐是十三個人，而基基督是被釘死在十字架上的。明太祖是尖下巴的，於是人們說尖下巴有帝王之相。很久以前，一個病人恰恰在貓頭　悲鳴的時候死去，於是人們就說生病時　　馴呌是不吉之兆·這些就是巧合　　了人類的錯覺。愛默生說：「　　生於無知·」假如我們生活在錯覺中，我們也生活在無知中！</p>
<h3>早餐</h3>
<p>— 于文</p>
<p>一九三八年來到上海，住在設於某一大樓的畫室附帶的小房間裏，因爲早晨必須出去授課，下午還得趕回來從事自己的工作，故一早起來最　要的事就是吃。當時最理想的早餐是一角大洋買十隻的葱油蟹壳黄或是熱騰騰的生前　頭，價廉物美，無可比擬。吃過之後不禁心滿意足，對人生大感興趣。</p>
<p>前幾天因事經過一條難得走過的石子街道，看見餅攤上剛出爐的蟹壳黄，忽覺肚餓，乃詢其價，攤主伸出五指一揚，說聲「五千一隻」，祗好量力買了兩枚，且行且啖。此餅風雖不减於當年，但我總覺得透過一層酥香的實在是一種苦澀刻骨的滋味。至於十年前吃最起碼早餐時那種「對人生大感興趣」的心情，再也無從捉摸了。</p>
<p>我的早餐究竟在何時開始向我吿別，詳細日子已記不淸，含糊些說，大概是在身任一名日報編輯的時候。此後便一直領略不到畫室「寓公」期間的小貧困中的小美麗了。</p>
<h3>跳樓論</h3>
<p>— 何苦</p>
<p>中國傳統的自殺方法極多，如自刎，自經，跳井，跳樓，要以跳樓自殺最爲悲慘，這一種慘死腦漿迸裂，血肉糢糊，千古艱難惟一死，跳樓白殺是艱難之中的艱難者。中國歷史上有一女子以墜樓著名，　是晋石崇的姬妾綠珠。綠珠的美色引起了孫秀覬覦，不惜假造皇帝老頭子的聖旨，收崇於獄，以爲奪得美人的手段，結果綠珠不願屈服於暴力之下，墮樓自殺。</p>
<p>因政治失敗而自殺的人　多，納粹政權傾覆以後，希特勒的生死還是一個謎，謠傳是服毒之後再加　屍滅跡，因無事實佐證，迄成疑案，姑置不論。戈林在被判決絞刑之前夕，服　錆化鉀自殺，可算是最最懦怯的從容自殺，與他當時的叱咤風雲，相去未免太遠。日本前首相東條老頭子的用手槍自殺，只是一種作態，近於婦人的披髮哭泣，呼喊駡街，藉爲今日遠東法庭審詢時大言不慚的張本而已。至於以政見不合，用跳樓自殺來作爲急流勇退者，當然要推到前日電傳捷克斯拉夫外長馬蕯里克的跳樓自殺了。倫敦所傳路透社電文，當然對馬氏大爲歌頌，「此間民主人士僉認馬氏之死，不啻已對二十一天前之捷克政變，提出最後抗議。」鄙人的看法則要拋棄政治上的複雜因素，　其臨命的果敢壯烈而言，値得世人一致頌揚。馬氏的政見容與政變後的捷克政府背道，爲了避免內心痛苦，願以身殉道，這一行徑，便接近佛敎「捨身飼餓虎」的精神；當然，我說是「接近」這種精神，並非眞的與捨身飼虎完全符合。</p>
<p>中國人對於政見異同，一向是遵守儒家的中　說數：「道不行，乘桴浮　海。」所請　跡山林是也。這是從入世轉爲出世的一條途徑。西洋人則願以身殉，身殉而至於墮樓，那是從入世還於入世。何以呢？他不願向新的環境屈服，在他的靈魂中只是遵守舊的傳統，旣不能反抗潮流，祗有「抱明月而長終」的一途，爲了自己的信仰而隱蔽於無形，所以還是入世的。</p>
<p>這種慘烈的死法，也許並不足以勵末俗，但可以說明的是一點，馬氏是爲了自己的思想自由，信仰自由而犧牲了。</p>
<h3>一個警喻</h3>
<p>— 冉冉</p>
<p>這幾天的情形，我們彷彿在看一塲電影。。</p>
<p>第一個　頭是一個很大的＄字，接着銀幕上發出一聲巨饗，這一個＄字裂爲許多碎片，一會兒，又凑合成爲整體，不過要比起初那個＄字小得多了。我這個譬喻，說得很粗淺，但是大家對於它的涵義，一定知之有素，因爲事實上可以說，我們是觀衆兼主角，除掉少數的幸運兒以外，一般人的處境，尤其是薪水階級者顯得很狼狽。我們袋中的鈔票或按月收入，平白的打了七折，六折……了。</p>
<p>丟開經濟上的損失不談，我認爲在心理上予人的打擊一定很大，頗足以影饗一般人的工作情緒。試問對街的某甲，在二三天前，買了五箱固本肥皂，每箱四百餘萬元，現在已漲到四百六十餘萬元一箱，一轉手之間；不要他費去半絲的腦力，或者化去分毫的體力，坐享二百餘萬元的利益。反觀某乙在某機關內當一份小差使，終日孜孜矻矻，每日所得平均祗有二十萬至三十萬元。在這種情形之下，豈非使其正在埋頭工作的人「氣沮」，而羣趨於「囤戶」的一途！買不了整」箱」整一包」的，就是置幾塊肥皂和幾盒火柴也行。結果，也許用不到發生「經濟的危機」，人心的癱瘓，也足以破壞建設的情緒而有餘了。</p>
<p>其實，事在人爲。美國通貨膨脹的情形，也很糟。他們却有他們的應付方法。</p>
<p>第一是抽　銀根，銀行限制貸款。買貨物的頭寸，無從挪移，物價勢必欲漲乏力。問題在於銀行限制貸款後，多餘的存款如何運用，倒是頗費斟酌的。</p>
<p>其次是貨物的供給量，短期內不易提高，祗有從管制市上買戶入手。</p>
<p>以上是他山之石，或者可攻目前之「錯」吧·</p>
<h3>凍餅</h3>
<p>— 毛毅</p>
<p>自從戈登·　爾在二十二歲投身糕餅業以來，他一直夢想着開設一家沒有　子的糕餅店。今天，他正是美國最異常的糕餅店的老闆，他的出品不是烘的，却是凍的！</p>
<p>全美國有兩百家店鋪經售他所製造的凍的饅頭，餅，　包卷和餅　。顧客們買回家去秖要在　子上烘一烘就可以吃了。</p>
<p>這種新法製造的糕餅替近代的主婦們解決了如何自己烘焙而麻煩最小的問題。一塊「凍餅」可以在家用的冰箱中放　天，沒有走味，僵硬，或變　的危險。</p>
<p>梅爾自信他所主持的是全世界第一家並且獨一無二的沒有爐子的糕餅店。這家舖子開設在支加哥西邊的橡樹園村。村中人口近七萬名，是美國最大的村莊。</p>
<p>梅爾的凍餅現在已暢售全美。這些糕餅全是由專門的師傅製造的，放在紙盒子裏，份量適於家用，凍在零下十度的冰箱中·像運送冰淇淋一樣，它們被用冰箱車送到零售商的冰箱中，然後賣給主顧。</p>
<p>餅的所以受到主婦的歡迎，主要的原因之一是它們的新鮮·一般店舖裏所賣　糕餅至少要離出爐時間有數小時之久，陳到一兩天的也有。如果把凍餅買回家去，　要在　上一烘，就同新鮮的一樣。另一種優點是節省精力和時間。主婦用不到攪拌麵粉，加調味品和發酵，祗需烘焙一下就行了。凍麵包卷烘好之後，體積可以膨大一倍，發酵的性能毫不因冰凍而受損。</p>
<p>梅爾因痛恨每天淸晨三點半起身工作和不分冬夏的長時間的站在酷熱的爐子前工作，就想起製造凍餅·而他的創造的確便利了不少主婦。</p>

<h3>林肯的鬍鬚</h3>
<p>— 雷嬰</p>
<p>我們所見的林肯畫像或照片，沒有一張不是　　繞頰的，加上了他的蓬鬆的頭髮，淸癯的面容，仁慈而又帶一點憂鬱的眼神，給我們整個的印象是　一種莊嚴與平易的混合。</p>
<p>但是，當他在一八六〇年由共和黨提名爲大總統候選人的時候，他的頷下却還是牛山濯濯的一片乾凈土。</p>
<p>使他留起　　來的，是一個十一歲的女孩子。</p>
<p>那時，林肯被提名爲候選人的消息到達了紐約。紐約的出版家旭斯立刻就派了一個名呌希斯的畫家，到伊里諾愛士州拜訪林肯，爲林肯畫了一張半身側面的油畫像。這是林肯生平第一張畫像，穿着深黑的禮服，在藍灰色的背景前，神情肅穆，如有所思—而頷下光光的毫無茂林豐置之美。</p>
<p>這張畫像被製版傳佈，供林肯競選之用。那一年的競選是非常熱烈的，連小孩子們也各分黨派，熱心地討論競選人的優劣。在紐約州的西用城，十一歲的女孩子格蘭絲·比黛兒（Grace　Bedell）是贊成林肯做大總統的，但當她把林肯的像片仔細硏究之後，她忽然發現了林肯的缺點……</p>
<p>那年秋天，林肯正忙於競選，每天收到了無數的信件，突然，一封信引起了他的注意。這封信的文法很多錯誤，甚至把林背的名字也弄錯了一點，但信的內容却充滿了懇　的關切。那封信說:</p>
<p>「林肯先生：我的父親剛從巿塲回家，帶回了你的像片。我是一個十一歲的小女孩子，但是我非常之希望你能够做美國的大總統，所以我現在寫信給你，想來你不會見怪罷？我不知道你有沒有像我這樣年紀的女見，如果有的，就請你代我向她問候，假使你沒有工夫寫回信給我，就請她代意給我。我有四個哥哥，他們之中有幾個都想選你，如果你肯留一點鬍鬚，那麼我一定勸他們一致選你了。你的臉很瘦，留了鬍鬚一定比現在更好看得多。女人都是喜歡男人留鬍鬚的，你留了鬍鬚後，她們就一定會逼她們的丈夫來選舉你了。我的父親一定也會選你，我如果是男人，也一定要選你……」</p>
<p>這封信的署是「格關係。比黛兒」。</p>
<p>實在，那時候的時髦人物是不　　子的，但這封信的關切使林肯深深感動了。三天之後，林肯寫了一對回信給格蘭絲：</p>
<p>「親愛的小姑娘：你的可愛的信已經收到了。可惜，我沒有女兒。我有三個兒子—一個十七歲，一個九歲，一個七歲。加上我和他們的母親，就是我們全家了。至於鬍鬚呢，我從來沒有留過，如果現在留起來，你想人家會不會說我裝腔做　呢？」</p>
<p>然而，林肯竟然　起鬍鬚來了，等到他在下一年自伊里諾愛士州故鄕到華戚頓去就任總統的時候，已經于思于思，大有可觀。</p>
<p>林肯沒有忘掉那個小女孩子。當他的專車行經紐約州西用城時，火車站上照例擠滿了歡迎他的羣衆。格蘭絲一淸早就到了車站，頭髮束得整整齊齊的，穿了她的最漂亮的衣服，手裏緊握着一束鮮花。但是，人愈來愈多，她漸漸地被人擠到了極遠的地方。她能够聽見林肯的演說，但她的前面全是大人，她再三想看一看那位偉人有沒有　鬍鬚，然而竟無法看見林肯的面目。</p>
<p>林肯的演說漸漸吿終，格蘭絲的心有些沉重：也許，他就此跳上了火車，就這樣離開了西田，她就很難再見到他了</p>
<p>但林肯突然高聲發問：「此地有一位和我會通過信的朋友，如果她也在這裏，我　　見一見她。」</p>
<p>沒有人站出來回答他。</p>
<p>羣衆中傳出了呼聲：「誰？誰？她呌什麽名字？」　「她的名字呌格蘭絲·比黛兒。她曾寫信給我，說我留了鬍鬚可以好看一些·」</p>
<p>在一片笑聲中，格蘭絲被他們引到了林肯面前。林肯從講台上走了下來，和那個小女孩子握手。然後，他吻了她。</p>
<p>她指着自己的鬍鬚對他說：「格　絲，我　了你的話，留了鬍鬚了。」</p>
<p>當年的小格蘭絲後來成爲喬治。畢靈士夫人，她回憶這一天的情形時說：「總統的舉動太意外了，我窘得儘快的逃回家去，一路上儘量地避開路上的車馬，有一回還從一輛馬車的下面鑽了過去。到了家才突然想起，手裏的那束玫瑰花本來是預備獻給他的，見了他竟完全忘記了這回事。再仔細看看，手裏緊握着的已祗剩幾根花莖了。」</p>
<p>當時的報紙上曾把這件事大爲宣傳，紐約論壇報的大標題是「美麗少女吻總統」；聖路易共和日報上更開玩笑說，如果和少女接吻也是大總統的特權之一，那麽林肯夫人爲維　本身權益起見，應該力爭這一方面的否決權了。</p>

<h3>U.S. President Reiterates Stance on China: Helping Our Government Maintain Peace, Expanding the Foundation Does Not Include the CCP</h3>
<p>[U.S. News Service, Washington, 11th] President Truman reiterated the U.S. policy toward China at a press conference on the 11th, as stated in his December 15, 1945 declaration, which suggests that the foundation of the Chinese government should be expanded. He painstakingly explained that this policy does not mean that the Communist Party should be included. In answering questions about China, the President acknowledged some confusion between the terms "Communist Party" and "free individuals" in China. He explained that communists are those who believe in governing the country from the top down through a totalitarian government. He pointed out that there are many free individuals in China, many of whom have been educated in the United States, forming an intellectual class. He hopes that these people can be included in the expanded foundation of the Chinese government. This topic was raised when a journalist asked the President if U.S. policy still favored including the Communist Party in the Chinese government. The President replied that he was not aware that this had ever been U.S. policy. He pointed out that the United States has been on friendly terms with the Chinese government and is currently trying to help the recognized government maintain peace. When asked if expanding the Chinese government meant including the Communist Party, Truman replied, "No," and reiterated his answer. When asked if the President could explain General Marshall's mission to China in 1946, the President said it was an effort to help the government cope with the situation at the time. Then a reporter pointed out that Marshall, in his report after returning from China, had suggested including the Communist Party in the government. The President replied that he did not think General Marshall needed the Communist Party to join the Chinese government. The President also said that he did not want the Communist Party to join the government of China or any other country. (Note: In his report on China, Marshall expressed the hope that during the transitional period of government reorganization in China, "the door will be open to the Communist Party or other groups to join if they can jointly bear responsibility for the future of China.") (The Secretary of State further recounted that before the President issued the policy statement, the Chinese themselves had agreed to hold a political consultative conference, including representatives from all parties and factions, but the agreement reached at the meeting was not fulfilled.)</p>
<p>U.S. State Department Issues Statement Explaining Secretary Marshall's Policy on China</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 11th] The U.S. State Department issued a formal statement on the afternoon of the 11th to clarify Secretary Marshall's description of U.S. policy toward China at a press conference yesterday, as the Secretary of State's views on the China issue have caused misunderstandings. The State Department pointed out that Marshall's reference to President Truman's December 15, 1945 statement on China was to indicate that the United States believes that "if the foundation of the Chinese government is expanded to accommodate other political elements in the country, it will be beneficial to China's peaceful unification and democratic reform." The State Department stated that Marshall firmly believes that Truman's statement is still valid. The State Department's statement continued: "Yesterday, Secretary Marshall was specifically asked whether expanding the foundation of the Chinese government necessarily meant accommodating the CCP?" Marshall replied that the Communist Party has now openly betrayed the government, so this matter "is whether or not to resolutely allow the Communist Party to participate in the government" and is for the Chinese government to decide; the U.S. government cannot overstep its bounds. Because Marshall's answer to the above question was originally just a "yes," the reporters misinterpreted it to mean that the U.S. State Department still insisted that the CCP must participate in a united central government. The State Department's explanation today is generally considered to be fundamentally inconsistent with the newspaper's interpretation of Marshall's views. Regarding the State Department's explanation, it is generally believed that Marshall has withdrawn his previous claim that the CCP must participate in the reorganized united government of China. The State Department's formal statement today may have been prompted by the differing interpretations of Marshall's remarks in the newspapers.</p>
<h3>U.S. House Foreign Affairs Committee Decides to Draft Unified Foreign Aid Plan: Economic Aid to China Included in Aid to Europe Plan</h3>
<p>[U.S. News Service, Washington, 11th] Republican members of the House Foreign Affairs Committee met with House Speaker Martin and Majority Leader Halleck on the 11th and decided to support an overall foreign aid plan, which will then be divided into two categories: one for the European Recovery Program and economic and relief assistance to China, and the other for military assistance to China, Greece, and Turkey. This matter will continue to be discussed on Friday, and the committee is scheduled to begin drafting legislation on Monday. The economic portion of the House plan is similar to the European Recovery Act currently being discussed in the Senate but will include $570 million in economic aid to China. The Senate Foreign Affairs Committee has not drafted any legislation on military assistance to Greece, Turkey, and China, and the administration has not requested military assistance. Any foreign aid agreement finally passed by the House and Senate must resolve any differences in a conference.</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 11th] The House Foreign Affairs Committee, despite opposition from the administration, included military assistance in the European Recovery Program bill on the 11th. Committee Chairman Eaton said that the committee will begin drafting a two-part bill on the 12th, providing economic assistance to China and the sixteen countries of Western Europe. This bill will also include providing appropriate military assistance to China, Greece, and Turkey. Eaton did not indicate when this bill would reach the House.</p>
<h3>Foreign Affairs Personnel Foreshadow: Three Key Points of Military Assistance Aimed at Ensuring Our Victory in Suppressing Communists</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 11th] According to sources in the House Foreign Affairs Committee on the night of the 11th, the military assistance to China, which they previously decided to include in the overall European Recovery and China Assistance package, will include a three-point plan aimed at ensuring President Chiang's victory in the war against the Communists. So far, it is understood that military assistance will include the following three points:</p>
<p>(1) Supplying surplus ammunition and other war equipment.</p>
<p>(2) Allocating cash for China to purchase necessary armaments factory machinery, chemicals, and mineral products in the United States for China to manufacture ammunition.</p>
<p>(3) Changing the U.S. military delegation in Nanjing so that the delegation can directly fight on the battlefield.</p>
<p>They said that the actual cash allocation required for military assistance to China that the committee members believed was necessary would be less than what was speculated. They pointed out that the cost of surplus assets would not be high in the appropriation bill, and the military delegation was already in China. The only cash needed would be for purchasing machinery, chemicals, and mineral products that cannot be obtained in China for China to build its own armaments industry. The committee members said that they hope that the U.S. military advisory group in Nanjing will no longer be subject to the control of the State Department. They stressed that this would be a necessary route due to the State Department's opposition to military assistance to China. Some congressional figures believe that the actual cost of military assistance to China in the coming year will not exceed $100 million because the committee believes that most of the materials can be obtained from surplus materials.</p>
<h3>Civil Aviation Pilot Talks About Encounter with Soviet Aircraft Attack</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper News] Civil Aviation Transport Corps transport plane number 524 was pursued by two Soviet P-39 fighter planes near Qingdao recently and was strafed with machine guns. Yesterday, the plane's pilot Bauer, co-pilot James Mack, and telegraph operator Yao Changzhi came to Shanghai from Qingdao and especially invited the city's press to report the facts at 4 pm. They said: "The plane was carrying 35 passengers, taking off from 　Yang, destination Qingdao. When it reached more than a hundred miles above Qingdao, it suddenly encountered two P-39 fighter planes, the fuselage 　with a five-pointed red star (the identification mark of Soviet aircraft) pursuing and circling, and signaling our plane to follow 　plane to fly. Our plane ignored it and still flew according to 　line, and the two planes strafed with machine guns, but it was a warning and did not intend to shoot down our plane, so it was not hit. "Also said, "After our plane landed safely in Qingdao, the situation was reported to the authorities, and the US military authorities stationed in Qingdao sent two planes to search, but nothing was found. "Finally, Bauer showed three photos he took when the "Red Star" plane was pursuing.</p>
<p>In other news, Bauer said: He believed that the purpose of the Soviet plane was to force the civil aviation plane to land in Lushun or other communist areas to search for information.</p>

<h3>Joint Meeting of Two Relief Organizations: Requesting the U.S. to Expedite Food Transport and Discussing Agricultural Rehabilitation and Other Issues</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency Nanjing 12th] The Executive Yuan Committee for Handling U.S. Relief Supplies and the American Government's China Relief Association held a joint meeting at 10 am on the 12th, chaired by Miao Jiaming, with China Relief Corps leaders Gilbert Birk and Mod, and all members of the Committee attending. In the meeting, in addition to asking the U.S. representatives to immediately transfer to the U.S. government to expedite the shipment of relief food to China, the members also exchanged opinions on whether the agricultural rehabilitation this year, Guangzhou levee restoration, Zhejiang Qiantang and sea embankment project expenses should continue to be overdrawn from the Central Bank, or sell supplies to supplement expenses. According to the person in charge of the Committee when meeting with the Central News Agency reporter: The committee, according to the Sino-U.S. relief agreement, can handle about $48 million worth of relief supplies aided to China by the United States, mainly food. Of the $48 million, $30 million is allocated to China in the U.S. foreign aid plan, and the other $18 million is another emergency loan from the United States. After deducting various expenses, the total is about $44.5 million, equivalent to 150,000 tons of food. According to the Sino-U.S. agreement, U.S. representatives can assist our government in handling it. National distribution matters, the proceeds from the sale can be directly used for relief expenses; at the same time, it is stipulated that our country should also raise the same amount of food. Therefore, this relief food is a total of 250,000 tons. After consultation between China and the United States, a four-month trial run was first conducted, and Beijing, Shanghai, Ping, Tianjin, and 　were temporarily the main five metropolitan cities. It was agreed that the Food Department would 　the grain distribution in March, the U.S. grain distribution in April, the municipal government grain distribution in May, and the U.S. grain distribution in June. Currently, the grain to be raised by the Food Department and various municipal governments has been raised, and the U.S. grain is also being shipped to China one after another. As for the general office of the U.S. government's China Relief Corps, there are offices in Shanghai, Qingdao, Nanjing, Tianjin, and Guangzhou. According to the Sino-U.S. relief agreement, U.S. representatives are in contact with our government at any time. If they disagree with our government's handling of the relief supplies, they have the right to withhold U.S. relief food. The expenses of the group are separately used from the proceeds from the sale of U.S. relief supplies.</p>
<h3>Song Xilian and Chen Xihao Report Duties in Capital After Flying from Lanzhou</h3>
<p>[This newspaper Lanzhou 12th] Liu Mengchun, Song Xilian, Chen Xihao, Liu Zerong, Qu Wu, etc., who flew from 　to Lanzhou, held a meeting in the officers' assembly hall last night, chaired by Zhang Zhizhong, which did not end until midnight.

Last year, more than 10,000 　of military reclamation farmland in northern Xinjiang, and this year it is planned to reclaim 30,000 mu, and next year to reclaim 60,000 mu. This kind of military reclamation and increased food production is enough to meet the needs of the entire Xinjiang military grain and more. The national army stationed in Xinjiang has strict training and high morale, but transportation is extremely difficult.</p>
<h3>Former Siamese Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs, Yunkim Phok, Will Be New Ambassador to China</h3>
<p>Dullar Scheduled to Leave Capital for Shanghai</p>
<p>[Central News Agency Nanjing 12th] After the resumption of diplomatic relations between China and Siam, the new Siamese ambassador to China will soon be decided.

According to news from the Ministry of Finance: This suggestion is inconsistent with the provisions of Article 5 of the Management Measures for the Redemption and Manufacturing of Gold Jewelry by Silver Shops (Silver shops cannot redeem gold bars and must not melt gold jewelry into bars for sale). If silver shops are allowed to redeem gold bars, the gold 　road　will be wide, corresponding to the drumbeat of the gold black market, which will help to increase the fluctuation of gold prices. It was not approved. In addition, after the revision and announcement of Article 4 of the Management Measures for the Redemption and Manufacturing of Gold Jewelry by Silver Shops, silver shops in various places have gradually resumed the sale of jewelry gold. In order to prevent and control the fluctuation of gold prices, the Ministry of Finance 　has telegraphed the provincial and municipal governments, gold control bureaus and relevant agencies in various places. In addition to strictly controlling the business of silver shops, it has strengthened the investigation and crackdown on the black market for gold.</p>

A person in charge told reporters on the 12th: Applications for production business loans can now begin, but they must comply with the provisions of the production business loan policy. Within the scope of this policy, if each factory believes that it is necessary to apply for a loan, it can apply to each bank.

<p>Commentary</p>
<h3>A Comparison of the Rate of Industrial Production in the United States and the Soviet Union</h3>
<p>— Wu Jingchao</p>
<p>When comparing the rate of industrial production in the United States and the Soviet Union, there is a difficult problem: the choice of time period. If we compare the rate of production in the two countries after 1917, it seems unfair to the United States, because after 1917, the industrialization of the United States had reached a considerable level, while the Soviet Union can be said to have just begun. The rate of industrial production in a country that is just beginning to industrialize is always higher, just as a baby's growth rate cannot be compared with that of an adult. To give an example, a country that only produces ten cars a year, if it produces twenty cars the second year, its rate has doubled. Another country, if it can already produce a thousand cars in the first year, even if it increases production by two hundred cars in the second year, its rate will only increase by 20%. Therefore, when we compare the rate of industrial production in the two countries, we cannot compare the situation after the founding of the Soviet Union with the situation in the United States during the same period. Another method is to compare the rate of industrial production in the United States from 1870 to 1900 with the rate of industrial production in the Soviet Union from 1918 to 1948. The length of these two periods is the same, both thirty years. The production equipment in the United States in 1870 was彷彿 to the production equipment in the Soviet Union in 1918. If we compare the production rates of these two periods, it may give us an answer, telling us whether the rate of development in a capitalist country can keep up with that of a socialist country. However, this kind of comparison is unfair to both the United States and the Soviet Union. It is unfair to the United States because the production technology of the 19th century was far inferior to that of the 20th century. The production technology that the United States was able to use in the thirty years after 1870 was far inferior to that which the Soviet Union was able to use in the thirty years after 1918. It is unfair to the Soviet Union because those thirty years for the United States were太平日子. Americans could develop their domestic economy in a state of无外患内发, while the Soviet Union had two or three years of内忧 and five or six years of外患 in those thirty years. The strength of construction was sometimes offset by the strength of destruction. Therefore, this comparison also has difficulties.</p>
<p>After adopting various comparison methods, I feel that one method is more appropriate. This method is to choose the most favorable period of development within the development period of the Soviet Union. I have selected the period from 1928 to 1940. 1928 was the date the Soviet Union began implementing its first five-year plan. 1940 was the year before the Soviet Union joined the European War. During these twelve years, the Soviet Union implemented a planned economy, mobilizing the strength of the whole country to develop its national power in a state of peace. The Soviet Union's development plan emphasized industry over agriculture, and heavy industry over light industry. From various industrial production statistics, we have specifically selected the production of coal, steel, and oil in heavy industry to compare with the United States. These three materials are the foundation of industrialization and are also what the Soviet Union valued most.</p>
<p>We first find out the production of these three materials in the Soviet Union in 1928, and then find out the economic history of the Soviet Union twelve years later, that is, 1940, to see which year's production of each material was similar to the Soviet Union's production in 1928, and which year's production was similar to the Soviet Union's production in 1940. I say similar instead of equal, because it is difficult to find years with equal output in the production statistics, which are based on years.</p>
<p>The production of the three materials in the Soviet Union in 1928 and 1940 is listed below:</p>
<p>Material Unit 1928 Production 1940 Production</p>
<p>Coal Million tons 29.1 164.7</p>
<p>Steel Same as above 4.2 21.8</p>
<p>Oil Same as above 9.2 34.2</p>
<p>The years and production of these three materials in the United States that can be compared with the Soviet Union are listed below:</p>
<p>Starting from the period when the production of coal in the United States was similar to that of the Soviet Union in 1928, it took 21 years to reach a production similar to that of the Soviet Union in 1940. Using the same method, it shows that the increase in steel production took 15 years, and the increase in oil production took 13 years. One point that needs to be added here is that regarding steel production, there are two statements about the Soviet Union's production in 1940, one is 21.8 million tons and the other is 18.4 million tons. I have adopted the higher statistics here. If the lower statistics are adopted, then starting from the period when the steel production of the United States was similar to that of the Soviet Union in 1928, it would not take 15 years to reach the Soviet Union's production in 1940. On average: it took 16.3 years for the production of these three materials in the United States, starting from the period when the production was similar to that of the Soviet Union in 1928, to reach a production similar to that of the Soviet Union in 1940.</p>
<p>Comparing twelve years with sixteen years and some months, it seems that the rate of production under capitalism is not as good as the rate of production under socialism. But it is difficult to make this kind of determination. First, we have only compared the rate of production of three materials. If we increase the types of materials, especially if we also select a few consumer goods and include them in the calculation, the result will definitely be different. Unfortunately, this kind of statistical data is not easy to collect. Secondly, we must pay attention to the fact that the United States had already reached the production of the Soviet Union in 1940 for the above three materials before World War I. Before World War I, the technology of production was far less advanced than after World War I. The method of steelmaking used in the United States between 1890 and 1905 was definitely not as new as the method used in the Soviet Union between 1928 and 1940. Therefore, the comparison method I adopted is generally unfair to the United States. But even under this kind of not very fair comparison method, the performance of the United States is not much different from that of the Soviet Union. Therefore, this kind of comparison is a very valuable reference material for us to judge the merits of the two systems.</p>
<h3>Chairman Chiang's Arbor Day Address: Encouraging National Afforestation and Forest Protection; Governments at All Levels to Provide Technical Assistance</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency Dispatch from Nanjing, 12th] The Capital's Arbor Day Commemoration Conference was held at 10 a.m. on the 12th in the auditorium of the Central Forestry Experimental Institute. More than 70 representatives from various agencies attended, and Mr. Wang, an American advisor to the Ministry of Agriculture, and two others also participated. At the meeting, Chairman Chiang's instruction was read out. Minister Zuo Shunsheng presided over the meeting and said: the密茂 of forests is quite enough to symbolize the興盛 and 進步 of a country. Mayor Shen Yi said in his speech that he was deeply悠慨 that there are still many濯濯童山 in the suburbs of Beijing. He agreed with Minister Zuo's opinion that Arbor Day should be a day for us to警惕振奋, not just虛應故事. In addition, the Beijing Municipal Garden Construction Committee, in cooperation with the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry and the Municipal Government, plans to plant 8 million seedlings this year. The committee convened its inaugural meeting at Zhonglin Institute immediately after the Arbor Day Commemoration Conference.</p>
<p>Chairman Chiang's instruction: Forests have a great impact on human life. Our country is based on agriculture, and developing forestry is especially an urgent task for national economic construction. In the past, the people have not deeply understood the benefits of forests, so although afforestation has been carried out for many years, after afforestation, no attention has been paid to forest protection, resulting in insignificant results, which is regrettable. The purpose of holding Arbor Day is to form an action to awaken the people and gradually develop the habit of automatic afforestation and forest protection. Only when this good atmosphere is普及全國 can afforestation be successful. The government can only do its best to select seeds, cultivate seedlings, and promote guidance, while the implementation of planting and protection relies on the power of the whole people. In the future, governments at all levels must actively promote the afforestation movement, store large quantities of seedlings, provide them to the people free of charge, provide assistance in planting technology, and supervise townships, towns, and Baojia to automatically establish forest protection organizations. After ten years, the trees will become a forest, and the utilization will be 厚生, which can be拭目可俟. The Mushan area of Nanjing has 天時地利's excellent conditions, and I hope that the competent authorities will speed up the implementation of the Capital's Ten-Year Afforestation Plan, which was previously ordered, to provide a model for the whole country, and I hope for it.</p>

<h3>Relieving Northeastern Refugees: Adopting Agriculture and Industry Relief Methods</h3>
<p>Petition Group Makes Suggestions to the Social Department</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Nanjing, 12th] The Northeast Petition Group was invited by Minister Gu of the Ministry of Social Affairs for a banquet at 7:00 p.m. on the 12th and put forward specific opinions on the Northeast relief issue. It is roughly estimated that the number of refugees in various parts of Northeast China who are currently流亡集於 Shenyang has reached 1.2 million, 70,000 in Jilin and Changchun, about 10,000 in Jinzhou, and about 100,000 in Xinmin, Fushun, and Tieling combined, of which about 300,000 rely on粥厂s for their livelihoods. The emergency relief funds issued by the Ministry of Social Affairs and the relief funds raised by Madam Chiang last winter were barely enough to get them through. By February of this year, they had almost all been停顿. At present, it is urgent to continue maintaining the 粥厂s. However, based on one catty of Gaoliang rice per person per day, the minimum price of each catty is 4,000 circulation coupons, and 36 billion circulation coupons are needed each month. Please allocate emergency relief funds immediately to handle this. However, it is not a long-term solution for refugees to rely on 粥厂s for their livelihoods, so it is recommended to adopt 농赈 and 工赈 methods to seek a long-term solution. The delegation is scheduled to send Zhang Binci and Tian Yushi to attend the Resident Committee of the参政会 on the 13th to report on the situation in the Northeast, and is scheduled to hold a press conference at 3:00 p.m. on the 13th to report on the petition process. It is scheduled to go to Shanghai by night train on the 13th. When passing through Shanghai, it will appeal to the Shanghai Municipal Council. However, if the circulation coupon issue is not fully resolved, the departure will be postponed.</p>
<h3>Reforming Northeastern Circulation Coupons: Decision Reached in Principle</h3>
<p>Ratio Issue Under Study</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Nanjing, 12th] The Northeast circulation coupon issue was decided in principle on the 12th, namely (A) circulation coupons can be freely exchanged inside and outside the customs, (B) 法币 circulates out of the customs, and is used in parallel inside and outside the customs, and it is stipulated that it can be arbitrarily exchanged in banks. (C) Determine the ratio between 法币 and circulation coupons. The above three decisions were reported by Zhang Jia'ao, President of the National Bank, when he visited the Northeast Petition Group at 10:00 a.m. on the 12th. Zhang also told him that he had been summoned by the President on the evening of the 11th, and the President had given instructions on this matter. Then Zhang et al. conducted detailed talks for more than an hour. There are no problems in principle at present, only technical research. At the same time, after the issue of exchange is resolved, the most important thing is to determine the ratio. According to the wishes of the Petition Group and the opinions of the Ministry of Finance and the Central Bank, the standard is generally no lower than a ratio of one to ten. The Ministry of Finance is currently studying a solution with the Central Bank.</p>

<h3>Agricultural Bank of China's Third Land Bond Issuance Plan and Measures</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Nanjing, 12th] The plan and measures for the issuance of the Agricultural Bank of China's Third Land Bond were approved at the State Council meeting on the 12th. The original plan listed (A) the total amount of issuance as 50 billion yuan, (B) the issuance method as follows: it will be issued concurrently when handling land loans for purchasing land at appraised value, land requisition loans, and supporting self-cultivating farmers.

It will also be issued at the discretion of the municipal improvement loan, or it will be publicly sold to absorb cash according to the financial market situation for land improvement and land consolidation loans. (C) The interest rate is still set at 6% per annum. (D) For the repayment period, in order to protect the interests of bondholders, the repayment period is shortened by two years compared to the second period and set at five years. (E) Repayment method: Most land mortgage loans are of an amortized nature, so this bond also adopts an equal installment repayment method for both principal and interest, repaying principal and interest once a year. However, if necessary, it may be repaid early at any time after two years from the date of issuance. (F) This bond is divided into four types: 100,000 yuan, 250,000 yuan, 500,000 yuan, and 1 million yuan. It is reported that the bond is registered, and an impression or signature must be left when receiving the bond for verification.

The bond will begin to repay principal and interest after one full year from the date of issuance, and will be repaid in one payment of principal and interest each year thereafter, and will be cleared in five years, but may be repaid early at any time after two years from the date of issuance. The bond is secured by all the assets of the China Farmers Bank and its Land Finance Office and the land mortgage rights obtained from its loans. Bondholders must redeem the principal and interest at maturity within ten years with the bond, otherwise it will be invalid. If it is lost, the bondholder shall immediately report the loss to the China Farmers Bank and publish a statement declaring it invalid. After two months, if there is no dispute, the China Farmers Bank will reissue a new bond.</p>

<h3>Five-Nation Conference in Brussels Passes 50-Year Mutual Defense Treaty; Full Text to be Published After Signing Next Wednesday</h3>
<p>[United Press, Beirut, 12th] The five Western European nations, under the leadership of the United Kingdom and France, passed an unprecedented 50-year military alliance charter on the 12th to stem the westward advance of communism. (Moscow Radio immediately attacked the treaty, saying that it lacked legal force or international authority because the people of the five countries were not consulted.) The treaty stipulates that if any of the five countries, the United Kingdom, France, the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg, is subjected to external attack, this treaty is considered the basis for a Western European alliance that stretches from the Arctic Ocean in the north to the Mediterranean Sea in the south. It is generally hoped that many countries will participate in the military alliance when the 16 countries of the Marshall Plan meet in Paris next Monday. At the end of the meeting, the representatives of the five countries walked out of the venue, in a pleasant mood, talking and laughing. British representative Jebb said that he would fly back to London on the 12th, and other representatives also said that they would return to their countries as soon as possible on the 12th to submit the draft treaty to their respective governments. It is believed that the foreign ministers of the five countries plan to sign the treaty at the Brussels conference on Wednesday. Reliable sources said that the mutual assistance clause in the treaty stipulates that in the event of aggression, the five countries should automatically provide military assistance. If there are disputes between the contracting parties, they should appeal to the International Court of Justice in The Hague. The official text of the new treaty has not yet been published, and the communiqué only states that the treaty includes economic, social, cultural, and mutual assistance clauses. After the foreign ministers of the five countries sign the alliance treaty next week, it is expected that the governments of each country will publish its contents. The Five-Nation Conference was stimulated by the Czech coup and the Finnish incident and agreed to establish a draft treaty within nine days. It is believed that this is a new record for the speed of the creation of an important treaty. It is reported that with the passage of the economic clauses of the treaty, the overseas territories of the five countries will form a group, and it is expected that the implementation of the clauses will be the responsibility of a permanent consultative committee, which may be established in London.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 11th] The Five-Nation Western European Alliance Treaty is expected to be signed in Brussels next Wednesday, and British Foreign Secretary Bevin may personally attend. The tentative timetable is that Bevin will leave London for Paris on Sunday to participate in the European Sixteen-Nation Reconstruction Plan Conference, which will open at the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs next Monday. In his capacity as the head of the British delegation, he will deliver a speech to the plenary meeting on Monday afternoon or Tuesday. On Tuesday evening, he will travel by train from Paris to Brussels and sign the Five-Nation Western European Alliance Treaty the next day, returning to London on Thursday. According to people at the Brussels Conference, the Five-Nation Western European Alliance Treaty has a validity period of 50 years, and the full text includes a general outline and ten chapters. The general outline should include several clauses, stating that the main purpose of the treaty is to maintain freedom and democracy. People in London are particularly interested in the exact form of the security clause in the Five-Nation Alliance, because most of the security portion of the German issue discussed by the United Kingdom, the United States, France, the Netherlands, and Belgium in London in mid-April depends on the security clause in the Western European Alliance. It is believed here that the Brussels meeting is the link between the two meetings of the Six-Nation German Issue Conference in London and the European Sixteen-Nation Conference. For example, the clause in the Brussels Convention regarding allowing new countries to join the Western European Alliance will inevitably be discussed at the Paris Sixteen-Nation Conference. If the economic connections in the Five-Nation Western European Alliance Treaty are more detailed, it will delay other countries from joining the alliance under equal conditions. The Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg group had already advocated at the Brussels meeting that the five original signatory countries maintain the highest possible level of economic cooperation, so it is expected that they will not welcome other countries to participate in such close economic ties until the economic value of the Western European Alliance can be truly explained. The mutual assistance clause in the Five-Nation Western European Alliance Treaty should aim to avoid the resentment of the Soviet Union as much as possible, and the defense provisions therein should also be based on Europe as much as possible to avoid the impression of forming a anti-Soviet alliance and conform to the purpose and spirit of the United Nations Charter.</p>
<h3>The United States Pours All Political Forces to Prevent the Spread of Communist Forces; Truman Emphasizes That the Belief in Peace Has Been Shaken; Marshall Urges People to Maintain a Calm Attitude</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 12th] President Truman has today poured all of America's prestige and political power to curb the spread of communism throughout the world, while the government has begun to draft five plans to cope with what Secretary of State Marshall calls a major world crisis, including the Marshall European Recovery Plan, encouraging the organization of a Western European alliance, opposing the spread of communism in China and other places, continuing to work for peace despite difficulties, and striving to restrain the emotionalism of the American people. Both Truman and Marshall made statements in a very frank manner about the situation caused by the fierce conflict between the United States and the Soviet Union. The president openly admitted that his belief in achieving true world peace had been shaken, which was a first.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 11th] President Truman told reporters today that recent events in Europe have shaken his confidence in world peace, but he still believes that peace can be maintained and must be so in order to avoid the destruction of the world. He went on to explain the Truman Doctrine, saying that the purpose of this doctrine is to curb the expansion of communism, which will remain the main part of American foreign policy and a prerequisite for the European Reconstruction Plan. The president also answered inquiries about rumors that he would meet with Marshal Stalin, saying, "There is no basis for such rumors, and no one has contacted me about such a meeting."</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 11th] Marshall said in a speech at the United American Church Joint Conference, attended by President Truman and others, that the current world is in a "great crisis" and that Americans should handle it with calm judgment. A few hours earlier, President Truman had also said at a press conference that the recent developments in Europe have shaken his long-held belief in world peace.</p>
<p>Marshall said, "The whole world is in a great crisis of mutual accusation, suspicion, and misunderstanding. In this turmoil, the situation has been further complicated by the competitive movement. At this time, it is very important for everyone to express their opinions in moderate terms." He said that there has never been a greater need for calm judgment than now, and everyone should recognize the material, spiritual, and political conditions of other parts of the world and judge everything with conscience. Marshall said that he has only one positive request to the American people, which is to enact and implement the European payment plan. He criticized the domestic and foreign atmosphere slightly, saying, "Some foreigners misunderstand almost every foreign country, and we can only be patient, otherwise we will fail in action due to fear." Marshall also praised the five countries, the United Kingdom, France, Belgium, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg, for their discussion of the Western European Alliance in Brussels, saying that this is the first step in realizing many great dreams.</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, London, 11th] The News Communications Magazine yesterday published a letter from Churchill initiating the United States of Europe movement, and Churchill also called on all sectors to support it. The purpose of this movement is to create a common and consistent opinion. If there is a concept that everyone is European in the minds of the general public, governments will quickly take practical action.

If it encounters these two crises, Europe will be easily swallowed up by aggression, so the United States of Europe must be organized.</p>

<h3>French Special Tax Bill Becomes Law</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Paris, 11th] France's amended special tax law against inflation was passed on its second reading by the National Assembly today and has now become law. The original bill called for a total special tax collection of 130 billion francs, but this has been reduced to 118 billion francs after the amendment.</p>
<h3>The Constitution of England</h3>
<p>— (Written by Aemilius of England, Translated by Pifu)</p>
<p>The constitution of England has never been written into a single document; rather, it is a living framework containing historical experience and accepted by tradition. Although it has undergone repeated development, it still retains many of its characteristics. The reason why the constitution can stand to this day is due to the retention of certain fundamental spirits within the constitution.</p>
<p>In fact, only two major principles determine the direction of the development of the English constitution: one is the "rule of law," and the other is the recognition that the central government is subject to the law but endowed with supreme power. England should thank William the Conqueror and his successors for giving it a strong centralized government earlier than any other country in Europe, and thus creating a significant divide between the King and his subjects, great and small. This divide united all British subjects, prevented the arbitrary exercise of royal power, and protected the established laws of the country. The Magna Carta in history is the most commendable page in its development, and its success was entirely due to the cooperation and agreement between the King and the people. The former represents the governing, commanding, and proactive aspect of the national life, while the latter becomes the protector of the national law.</p>
<p>The royal expenditures for Parliament—the place for reaching agreements—greatly increased its power's primary key. Often, during discussions and negotiations, reforms are promoted in other areas, or legal additions and deletions are made. Another development is also quite important: formerly, when Parliament was dissatisfied with the King's appointed servants, it often resorted to methods of interrogation or demotion, but now it has become a regular practice to make more moderate inquiries and criticisms of these cabinet ministers. Due to this development, coupled with the belief that the King cannot act arbitrarily, the King's personal position and his administrative power have been divided into two, thus forming the most important feature of the current British constitution.</p>
<p>Once an empire has removed the individual's autocratic power, it essentially gradually becomes a symbol of the empire's life, survival, and unity. It is through this process of power separation that the King can become the center of loyalty for the entire nation, making loyalty to the King surpass everything else. In a country as complex as England in terms of both political system and society, there is really no other satisfactory common center other than the King.</p>
<p>In fact, the British throne has always maintained the power of administration and guidance, and this power has not only not been weakened but has also been greatly enhanced. Consider the most important reform in the British constitution, which is the major event of selecting a group of people from the members of Parliament to be appointed as cabinet members. Its significance seems to put the King's policy under the party's policy, but on the other hand, the government has therefore gained a magic weapon to control Parliament, which is tantamount to turning several heads of Parliament into the King's housekeepers.</p>
<p>Because these cabinet members are from the members of Parliament, and they take being members of Parliament as their lifelong career, they can make Parliament the center and focus of national politics. The reason why British politics can maintain unity and harmony is entirely due to the personal relationship between Parliament and the government. No matter how much reform there is in the evolution of the constitution, the two major spirits of British politics have always maintained their brilliance, because we know that the British constitution is ultimately based on the government and the representatives of the people. In the constant consultation and contact in Parliament, the government represents the guiding and executing side, but it must obtain the consent of the people. To obtain the consent of the people, there must be lengthy deliberations in Parliament. Mr. Bagehot said it well: "The action and reaction between the cabinet and Parliament is the life of Britain." Today we can also say "between the cabinet and the opposition party," because most of the criticism work in Parliament has gradually been taken over by the opposition party.</p>
<p>The British constitution has never recognized voters as the original elements of political activity, allowing him to elect a representative to Parliament to express his opinion, or to choose an administrative organ that meets his wishes. It must be known that the starting point and driving force are always in the hands of the government. The activity of British political life is centered on the government. When it comes to the two-party system, we often think that it is a pleasant result accidentally obtained in the historical evolution, or that it is a natural result representing two different ideas. Both of these statements are reasonable, but it must be known that the tradition of British politics is government first, and the opinions of voters or members of Parliament are limited to choosing between agreeing or disagreeing. Under this tradition, the emergence of a two-party system is a natural reason. On closer examination, it must also be attributed to this tradition, which enables the government, which is gradually supported by the majority in Parliament, to obtain a certain degree of stability. Foreign constitution imitators often lose their way on this point. Their idea is to take a voter's representative, through the legislative process, to reach the administrative stage, as the entire concept of political power, and they believe that this concept can be united with the external structure of the constitution. Because of this concept, the voter's right to choose a political party is inevitably elevated, and the voter is made to recognize this as the ultimate goal, thus causing party divisions, and the government is no longer the master of Parliament, but becomes the tail of Parliament. The formation of dictatorship and bureaucracy is mostly due to only knowing how to imitate the shell of the British constitution, while ignoring its essence, ignoring the tradition that there must be a strong and stable government. In any case, any constitution that focuses on electing representatives is not the British constitution. The British system is a democratic system, a tacit democracy, not a democracy through elections or appointments. The British government is with the people, but it is not the people's, nor is it Parliament's. To borrow a grandiose phrase, it is the King in Parliament. (To be continued)</p>
<h3>Countries Take Precautionary Measures to Prevent Domestic Communist Activities</h3>
<p>[United Press, London, 11th] The sudden death of Czech Foreign Minister Masaryk and other events in that country have caused repercussions in various European countries today. The Swiss Parliament passed a resolution condemning the Swiss Communist Party by a vote of 187 to 7 and called on the government to take precautionary action to defend the country. All parties except the Communist Party voted in favor, and the motion stated, "The past few weeks have shown the danger to democratic countries if they do not have the determination to prevent internal attacks."</p>
<p>In The Hague, Dutch Justice Minister Nyasiven stated that the government would announce the organization of special police within two days to curb extremist activities from all sides. The government has been preparing to form special police for some time, and the decision was made quickly due to the Czech coup.</p>
<p>In Paris, French Foreign Minister Bidault also delivered a speech in Parliament, mentioning the actions of the Communist Party in Romania, Bulgaria, Hungary, Poland, and the Czech Republic in recent months. He said that such actions could not be agreed to by France. France will step up the organization of the rest of Europe, and the alliance treaty to be completed in Brussels by the five Western European countries is essential.</p>
<p>At the same time, several Czech ambassadors stationed abroad have resigned. Social Democratic Party member Novotny returned to China from India and said in Rome that he had resigned. The Communist Party's seizure of power this time had been prepared for a long time in advance. I will try to organize a group to help Czechs escape from this country.</p>
<p>In Copenhagen, the capital of Denmark, King Frederick IX addressed the cheering crowd and said, "I am determined to protect Denmark as a free country with all my strength."</p>
<p>In Canberra, Australian opposition leader Menzies said that the Liberal Party he leads would propose and support a complete ban on the Australian Communist Party and all other groups that have communist goals and means or are controlled by the Communist Party. Prime Minister Chifley had previously opposed this move.</p>
<h3>Bidault's Report on Diplomacy Supported by Parliament</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Paris, 11th] Foreign Minister Bidault reported on foreign policy in the National Assembly today, winning the support of all members except the Communist Party. Bidault said: "Recent developments in every country in Eastern Europe are very similar, and the nature of these developments makes people feel uncomfortable. The time has come for Western European countries to form an alliance. We must unite on the basis of the principles of freedom." When discussing the Greek problem, Bidault said that although the Greek government has shortcomings, there cannot be perfect governments in free countries at all. The Greek government was indeed a government produced by free elections held under international supervision. Referring to the Franco-Italian customs union, he said that negotiations were continuing and no agreement had been reached. Bidault, in response to criticisms about the organization of the Western European bloc, specifically listed fifteen mutual assistance treaties signed between Eastern European countries from 1943 to 1948. He said that Europe has the right to do what has already been done elsewhere. Members, except for the Communist Party, then passed the government's foreign policy with a majority of 236 votes and raised their hands to pay tribute to Masaryk.</p>
<h3>Korean Committee Resolves to Monitor South Korean Elections</h3>
<p>The US Occupation Authorities Should Be Reorganized</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Seoul, 12th] The United Nations Special Committee on Korea voted four to one on the 12th to monitor the South Korean elections on May 9th. The US occupation authorities should implement some reorganization to ensure an atmosphere of freedom. Canada and Australia voted against, and France and Syria abstained.</p>
<p>[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 12th] Syngman Rhee, representing the South Korean Democratic Unification Headquarters, sent a letter to the United Nations Korean Committee today, expressing his support for holding a general election. The letter stated: "The Democratic Unification Headquarters is composed of 70 political parties and groups, and unanimously supports the general election, because it believes that the general election is very necessary at present, and asks the Korean Committee to convene representatives of various political parties and groups to directly solicit opinions on the general election."</p>
<h3>US Policy of Fostering the Japanese Economy Will Revive Japanese Imperialism China, India, and the Philippines Vigorously Attack This</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 11th, Associated Press] Well-informed sources said: As Eastern countries in the Far Eastern Commission, they have vigorously attacked the US policy of fostering the Japanese economy and issued warnings that the Americans are laying the foundation for the revival of Japanese imperialism. It is said that in the work of the steering committee of the Far Eastern Commission, and in talks with American officials, representatives of the Eastern countries have protested against the US suggestions, made last year by the State Department and the Army-Navy Liaison Committee, regarding the permanent level of Japanese industry. According to the above suggestions, they are still under discussion in the Far Eastern Commission.</p>
<p>Well-informed sources continued: The Eastern countries are especially worried that the US may even relax the suggested level of Japanese industry further, according to the recently published Strike Report. The Chinese representative to the Far Eastern Commission has been the leader in attacking the US for this attitude to the level of Japanese industry. The Chinese representative has expressed his country's views on this matter in the steering committee. And the Indian and Philippine representatives have also stated that they are not satisfied with the US's ability to do this. The suggestions that the US is currently making in the steering committee of the Far Eastern Commission will allow the following levels for Japan's main industries: an annual production of two million tons of pig iron, three million five hundred thousand tons of steel ingots, two million five hundred thousand tons of steel plates, two hundred and fifty thousand machine tools, and ball bearings worth three thousand two hundred and fifty million yen. In addition, it will be allowed to build 150,000 tons of ships per year, maintain ship repair equipment of 10,000 tons, and maintain a merchant fleet of two million tons. But the US has stated that in order for Japan to be self-sufficient by 1953, these levels will need to be increased. Because various countries are currently opposing the US's attitude towards the level of Japanese industry in the steering committee, today's weekly meeting of the Far Eastern Commission had no progress on its agenda. Today's meeting discussed the US's suggestion to allow Japanese to attend international conferences for consultation. The representatives of China and India firmly opposed allowing Japanese to go abroad to participate in intergovernmental meetings with various countries' governments. The remaining representatives of the participating countries believed that each proposal should be weighed for its advantages and disadvantages and decided accordingly, and should not be blindly passed. The Soviet Union has not stated its position on all of the US's suggestions regarding Japanese industrial issues.</p>
<h3>Four Powers Reconvene to Discuss the Holy Land Problem The Soviet Union Suddenly Refuses to Participate The Security Council's Suggestions Have Apparently Failed</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Lake Success, 11th] Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Gromyko today threatened to refuse to participate in discussions with various countries on Palestine. Gromyko opposed countries directly negotiating any method to calm the dispute between the Arabs and Jews. The Soviet Union's warning was issued when the Security Council invited the chief representatives of China, France, the United States, and the Soviet Union to continue informal discussions on the Palestinian problem.</p>
<p>[Reuters, New York, 11th] In today's four-power Palestine conference, Soviet representative Gromyko solemnly refused to seek further opinions on the Palestine issue from the Jewish and Arab people, saying that the Soviet Union's position on the partition plan was extremely clear and would not allow any change. US representative Austin asked Gromyko to be flexible, but Gromyko replied, "I'm sorry, Russians never change their minds." Austin then said: "Then this meeting may inevitably fail." Gromyko did not answer, but only shrugged his shoulders. Austin then asked British representative Cadogan whether Britain could revise its timetable for withdrawing from Palestine if the Jewish and Arab sides could agree to some solution, but Cadogan replied: He could not answer "yes." Austin then asked if his intention was "no"? Cadogan replied: The withdrawal date has already been decided, and he has not received other instructions, but he also stated that British Colonial Secretary Jones recently stated that Britain would welcome any effort to find a bridge between the Jewish and Arab people, and this statement still applies today.</p>
<h3>Truman Asks Congress to Allocate Funds for Temporary Aid to France, Italy, and Austria Needs $55 Million to Purchase Goods</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 11th] President Truman today asked Congress to continue allocating $55 million to help Western Europe get through the period before the European Recovery Program is implemented, in order to order the goods necessary for the transition period. The president stressed that this amount is only needed to assist a very short transitional period extension, as Congress passed the transitional aid bill for France, Italy, and Austria last autumn, originally hoping to maintain it until the Marshall Plan was implemented, but judging from current signs, the transitional aid seems to be used up before the Marshall Plan is implemented, so transitional aid must be increased. In Truman's letter to House Speaker Martin, he strongly stated that the events in Europe in recent weeks do not allow the United States to risk cutting off supplies at this time, so he hopes that Congress can continue to allocate the funds needed for the transitional period before April 1st.</p>

<h3>Rice Supply Improves More Than 1,900 Resale Points Will Have Rice Delivered by Tonight at the Latest</h3>
<p>[Reported by Our Newspaper] Recently, citizens have been very crowded to buy rationed rice due to soaring rice prices. Warehouses have been unable to ship goods in time, and rice shops have been unable to distribute enough, resulting in people having to travel back and forth in vain. Rice shops that have rice for sale have lines of people queuing up to buy first, and the order is not good. The authorities are paying close attention to this and are working hard to improve it. Ren [Name], Chairman of the Civil Food Allocation Committee, visited Ruan Guangming, Director of the Administrative Office of the Police Bureau, yesterday to discuss asking the branch bureaus to assist in strengthening the supervision of the district intermediary warehouses to increase rice shipments. As for the allocation of rice to foreigners in the city, the Allocation Committee has started issuing certificates from yesterday.</p>
<p>[Another report] The Civil Food Allocation Committee announced that the rice shipment situation from various warehouses yesterday was good, and the most satisfactory was the First Warehouse of the China Trust Bureau. All the rice stored in the warehouse was completely shipped out yesterday. The East Warehouse and Lanlu Warehouse shipped rice overnight, and the rice stored in each warehouse can be shipped out today. The Gongyi and Taikoo warehouses each shipped 10,000 bags, and more can be shipped out today. In addition, the Yong'an Warehouse has been added as a distribution point for rationed rice. Taikoo Village will start meeting at 7:00 AM starting today, and the Customs will also send personnel to take turns. The foremen of each warehouse have also added porters. The 1,935 rice shops, district cooperatives, and social service centers throughout the city can have rationed rice delivered by tonight at the latest. Yesterday afternoon, each rice shop posted advertisements that the rationed rice had arrived, which was convenient for the citizens. In addition, since the China Trust Bureau started distributing rice on February 29th, the staff at all levels have indeed worked hard and there have been no delays. However, it is also a fact that the coordination of the Civil Food Allocation Committee's rice shops and vehicles has not been adequate, and improvements are being sought.</p>
<h3>Police Officers, Road Workers, and Street Cleaners to Receive an Additional Two Dou of Low-Priced Rice</h3>
<p>The Principle Has Been Determined and Will Be Implemented This Month</p>
<p>In view of the recent high prices and the fact that the living standards of general public education and treatment personnel are difficult to maintain, and the income of police officers, street cleaners, and road workers is even more meager, the city government authorities have decided to first request the Civil Food Allocation Committee to increase the allocation of low-priced rice by two dou per month in order to achieve reasonable improvement. Yesterday, the reporter specially visited Shen Zonglian, Secretary-General of the City Government, and asked about the results. Shen said: "At present, prices are soaring and the lives of civil servants are indeed difficult. The government hopes to improve them reasonably at all times. However, the Shanghai City Government is a local institution and can only follow the regulations of the central government in everything. Therefore, we can only help the poorest police officers, street cleaners, and road workers first, and request the Civil Food Allocation Committee to increase the allocation of rice by two dou. The principle has been approved, and the price of each dou is tentatively set at 80,000 yuan, which can be implemented this month. We hope that they can work with peace of mind as soon as possible."</p>

<h3>Continuous Heavy Fog Disrupts Air and Sea Navigation</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] Due to recent severe weather and heavy fog, navigation has been difficult, causing slight delays in the arrival and departure of ships. The Shanghai-Ningbo line Jiangjing Wheel was supposed to arrive in Shanghai from Ningbo yesterday, but had not been seen entering port by evening. The Jiangjin and Jiangyun Wheels, which were supposed to come to Shanghai from Ningbo yesterday, also had no news of leaving Ningbo by evening. Therefore, whether the ships sailing to Ningbo today can depart as scheduled is still uncertain. In addition, both China and Central Airlines have announced the suspension of flights on the Shanghai-Beijing and Shanghai-Chongqing routes for northern and central China, as the weather in the lower reaches of the Yangtze River and the Yellow River basin is exceptionally severe, and high-altitude "visibility" is extremely low, greatly affecting flight safety.

<h3>Smuggled Goods Seized in the Coal Bunker of a British Ship Arriving from Hong Kong</h3>
<p>According to the Jianghai Customs, on the 6th of this month, the British ship S/S Alipur arrived in Shanghai from Hong Kong. Upon arrival at the Wusongkou port, the Jianghai Customs, based on a confidential report, dispatched investigators in advance to intercept the ship. As a result of boarding and searching, smuggled goods were found hidden in the coal bunker on the port side, in the space behind the iron wall separating the large steam pipe above the boiler. The smuggled goods included dozens of items such as cigarette paper, steel files, belt buckles, shoe polish, playing cards, and Western medicine, with a total value of approximately 500 million yuan. The goods were immediately seized and handled according to regulations.</p>
<h3>Two Foreign Merchants Arrested for Operating in the Black Market for Gold and Currency; The Scale is Comparable to the Mesber Case</h3>
<p>The Economic Section of the Investigation Department of the Songhu Garrison Command has recently uncovered an organization run by foreign merchants involved in the black market for gold and currency. The scale of the case is comparable to the "Foreign Tiger" Mesber case uncovered by the department last spring. The main culprit in this case is a citizen of a certain country, who has now been apprehended. Zheng Zhongwei, the director of the Investigation Department, Zhang Yangmin, the deputy director, and Zhang Yamin, the chief of the Economic Section, received a confidential report at the end of last month, learning that a large-scale gold and currency black market organization was operating in a certain building in the city, and the person in charge was a certain foreign merchant. At that time, because the case involved foreign affairs, it was not convenient to launch an immediate operation. To avoid alarming the suspects, they remained low-key. Zhang, the chief of the Economic Section, dispatched Chen Mo, the leader of the Economic Group, leading a large number of officers, disguised as customers, to infiltrate the premises, investigate the situation, and monitor the suspects' actions. On the 7th of this month, after confirming that the operation was indeed a private gold and currency black market, they immediately reported to Commander Xuan and obtained his approval to proceed to the location together with the financial management authorities. Two foreign merchants, Qinsheng and Ketesiji, the main culprits, were captured on the spot, along with a number of accomplices. A large number of gold and currency transaction ledgers were also seized. All the suspects are currently detained at the Garrison Command and will be transferred to the court for interrogation within a few days. All files and gold currency were sent to the Financial Management Bureau yesterday for safekeeping.</p>
<h3>Two Customs Officers Sentenced for Accepting Bribes in the Hanyang Wheel Case</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] Yang Zhicai and Jin Qingliang, investigators from the Jianghai Customs, were sentenced yesterday to ten years of imprisonment by the local court for accepting bribes and dereliction of duty for personal gain. The cook Xin Afu was deemed not to be a civil servant and therefore could not be tried in criminal court, and the prosecutor was instructed to conduct a separate investigation. According to the case, on January 7th of this year, Yang and Jin were searching for smuggled goods on the Hanyang Wheel, which had arrived in Shanghai from Hong Kong. They discovered 31 gold bars of various sizes in the engine room of Xin Afu, the cook. They should have reported it to the customs for confiscation, but Yang and Jin accepted bribes of nine gold bars from the owner, Wu Guo, and let him go. Later, they regretted it and reported the incident to the customs, leading to the arrest of Yang, Jin, and Xin, and their transfer to the court for trial.</p>
<h3>Homicide on Shandong Road; Wife of a Worker at the Xinwen Bao Newspaper Strangled; The Murderer Was an Acquaintance and is at Large; Search Underway</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] Wu Dalin, 52, the wife of Fang Jinyuan, 50, a worker in the lead plate room of the Xinwen Bao at 264 Shandong Road, 3rd floor, was tragically strangled to death by a young man named Zhang Xiaoshan (nicknamed "Little Pudong," around 20 years old) at around 3:30 p.m. yesterday while she was alone at home. The victim and the murderer were acquaintances. In 1934, when Fang was responsible for the meals at the Xinwen Bao's colleagues' cooperative, a caterer from a place on Shanxi Road introduced Zhang Xiaoshan to Fang's service. After less than two months, he was dismissed. Later, Zhang often came to Fang's residence to chat. Fang had no children of his own but had an adopted daughter named Juzhen. Zhang admired her and expressed his desire to marry her, but Wu refused. Last year, the daughter married Zhang Kentang, a fellow worker at the newspaper, and Xiaoshan harbored a grudge. Recently, he had asked Fang for a loan of 200,000 yuan, but Fang only lent him 40,000 yuan, causing him to be dissatisfied. For the past week, he had been lingering at Fang's home, discovering that Fang always went to the City Temple to listen to stories after lunch. Fang had a nephew named Xuanlu, only eleven years old, who had come to Shanghai from his hometown less than two years ago and was currently studying at the newspaper's labor union children's school. Therefore, only Wu was left alone at home every afternoon. Yesterday afternoon, Zhang Xiaoshan went upstairs alone. Seeing Wu, he took out a hemp rope, looped it around her neck, and dragged her to the floor, stepping on her abdomen with both feet for more than ten minutes until she suffocated and died. Xuanlu, his nephew, returned home from school and witnessed Zhang Xiaoshan pressing down on his aunt. Not knowing what was happening, he mistakenly thought they were fighting and repeatedly called out, "Don't do this, let's talk things over!" Zhang replied, "Your mother hit me first, so I'm hitting her." He said he was extremely thirsty and ordered the child to pour a cup of tea. Xuanlu poured boiling water from the hot water bottle and handed it to Xiaoshan. At that time, both of Wu's hands had a gold ring. One ring on her right hand had already been robbed. Just as he was about to rob the gold ring on her left hand, he was seen by Xuanlu, who shouted "No!". Zhang knew he had been exposed, so he ran downstairs and fled. Xuanlu then went forward and called "Auntie" three times, but she could not be revived. He turned back and chased after him, but Zhang had disappeared. He ran to tell Cao Yumei, the pancake vendor at the entrance of the alley, and then went to the newspaper to call for help. Fang's colleagues arrived one after another to investigate and found that she had died tragically. A gold earring and gold chain were still on her neck. They immediately reported to the City Police Bureau and the Huangpu Branch Bureau. Kou Junhou, the chief of the Criminal Investigation Section of the General Bureau, arrived first with his staff, took photos of the deceased, and then Li Yinmin, the head of the Criminal Division of the Huangpu Branch Bureau, led his officers, Ren Fengwu, etc., to investigate the details of the victim. They immediately sent out detectives to search for the murderer. It is reported that Zhang Xiaoshan had a "flyer" haircut and was wearing a blue cloth shirt and trousers when he escaped. The body was sent to Renji Hospital and then transferred to the Changde Road autopsy room for examination.</p>
<h3>Police Bureau Accepts Migration Registration; Director Yu Explains the Truth</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] Recently, the central government stipulated that the police bureau will handle household migration registration. The outside world does not understand the truth and believes that the civil affairs bureau's household administration work will be handled by the police bureau. The council even requested the central government to withdraw its order, and the rumors varied. Director Yu of the Police Bureau made a special statement on this matter yesterday: The fact that this bureau will handle citizen migration and flow registration is in accordance with the regulations of the Ministry of Interior forwarded by the municipal government regarding the police and household administration agencies' investigation and reporting of household matters. Only the two items of moving in and moving out in the household registration law and household registration will be handled by the police agency during the period of suppression of rebellion in order to control changes and ensure social order. It is not the case that all household administration work will be handed over to the police bureau. Furthermore, the materials for migration registration handled by this bureau and various branch bureaus must still be sent to the civil affairs bureau and district offices for legal registration. It is purely a matter of using the police's manpower to assist the civil affairs bureau in promoting household administration work. There is no conflict between the work of the two parties. In addition, various simplified procedures have been established, such as citizens being able to use mail to handle move-in registration, or citizens can make their own appointments for re-inspection. These are simpler than the current registration methods stipulated by the Ministry of Interior. This matter concerns the safety and security of the city's citizens, and it is hoped that all sectors of society will continue to cooperate with the bureau's work with the same enthusiasm as in the past.</p>

<h3>On the Issue of Purchasing Taiwanese Coal and Depreciation, the Fuel Management Committee Explains Two Points: The Price of Coal Distributed to Public Utilities is Lower Than the Cost; Depreciation During Transportation Was Agreed Upon and Not a Corrupt Practice</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency] Regarding the two points made by Vice Chairman Sun in his speech on the 7th of this month, "The Ministry of Economic Affairs purchases He Coal at 1,500,000 yuan per ton of legal tender and sells it at several times this price," and in the recent report of the Control Yuan, "The habit of dock workers unloading coal in Shanghai results in a depreciation of 20/1000, which is a long-standing corrupt practice that cannot be eliminated in a short time. The actual amount of depreciation is not that great, and most of this coal enters the black market and is sold at inflated prices," the Fuel Management Committee of the Ministry of Economic Affairs issued the following statement yesterday:</p>
<p>Setting Distribution Prices Based on Needs</p>
<p>All coal produced in Taiwan, in addition to supplying various public and private uses in the province, is purchased and transported to Shanghai for distribution by the Provincial Coal Adjustment Committee and this committee. The purchase price is the same as the price of Kailuan coal delivered on board ships in Qinhuangdao. However, in terms of coal quality, Taiwanese coal is inferior to Kailuan coal, so the actual price of Taiwanese coal is higher than that of Kailuan coal. This committee adds transportation costs, insurance fees, shortages, and loading and unloading costs in Shanghai to the purchase price to arrive at the actual cost of purchasing the coal. Based on this cost, distribution prices are set separately based on public and private needs. Because the price of coal distributed by this committee to public utilities in Shanghai is still lower than the purchase cost, resulting in a large loss, it is necessary to slightly increase the price of coal distributed to other factories in order to make up for the loss.</p>
<p>Selling at High Prices is Not the Case</p>
<p>Vice Chairman Sun's statement that "purchasing at 1,500,000 yuan per ton of legal tender" likely refers to the coal price in January of this year. In fact, the purchase price of this committee in Taiwan in January was 1,530,000 yuan per ton, plus transportation costs of 450,000 yuan, ship delay fees of 67,500 yuan, pilot and dock fees of 46,800 yuan, insurance fees of 18,200 yuan, shortages of 64,000 yuan, and Shanghai dock fees (including loading and unloading, warehouse rent, dock equipment management fees, etc.) of 213,200 yuan, totaling 2,389,700 yuan per ton. The distribution price to public utilities in Shanghai was 2,180,000 yuan per ton, and the price to factories was 3,140,000 yuan. As for railways, military supplies, sea transport, harbor dredging, power plants in other cities, and various agencies under the jurisdiction of the Shanghai Public Utilities Bureau, they were all distributed at the purchase cost, and there was no selling at several times the price.</p>
<p>98% Delivery after Coal Unloading</p>
<p>Regarding the 41st point of the key points of the report on government economic measures in North China, published by the Control Yuan's delegates Yu Shude, Miao Peicheng, and Li Xiaoting, "The habit of dock workers unloading coal results in a depreciation of 20/1000, which is a long-standing corrupt practice that cannot be eliminated in a short time. The actual amount of depreciation is not that great, and most of this coal enters the black market and is sold at inflated prices," is slightly inconsistent with the facts. Shanghai coal users usually entrust the transportation of coal from the committee's warehouse or other dock warehouses to the factory to transportation companies. From the ship unloading at the Pudong warehouse to the landing at the Puxi dock, and then transported to the factory by truck, the losses during the whole transportation are usually contracted to the transportation companies, who agree with the factory on delivering at 99% or 98% of the coal amount depending on the distance. This method was originally to compensate for the actual losses during transportation, and it was agreed upon by both parties. There is no so-called 20/1000 corrupt practice.</p>

<h3>Tree Planting Day Commemorative Meeting Held at Zhongshan Park, Representatives from All Sectors Plant 200 Trees</h3>
<p>[Report from This Newspaper] The 37th Annual Tree Planting Day Commemorative Meeting of all sectors of the city was held at the Zhongshan Park Concert Hall at 3:00 PM yesterday. Attendees included City Government Secretary-General Shen Zongtan, Police Chief Yu Shuping, Social Affairs Bureau representative Wang Jiashu, Municipal Farmers' Association representative Lin, Municipal Women's Association representative Qian Jianqiu, as well as students from Yucai and Municipal West schools, and hundreds of citizens. After the Municipal Children's Education Center band played music, Chairman Shen, the Secretary-General, delivered a speech, explaining the significance of Tree Planting Day. He stated that Sun Yat-sen's creation of China was like cultivating trees, and today it has gradually grown. National reconstruction requires pillars of support, and as we commemorate the anniversary of Sun Yat-sen's death today, we must continue to work hard, and so on. Following Wan Molin's speech, Secretary-General Shen, representing Mayor Wu, planted the first tree beside the main road in the botanical garden. Leaders from various municipal agencies, prominent social figures, and organizations also planted a tree each, totaling 200 trees.</p>
<p>Director Zhao Calls for Greening of Shanghai</p>
<p>Furthermore, Public Works Bureau Director Zhao Zukang, and Zhu Guoxi, the bureau's structural division chief, went to the Gaoqiao seaside at 1:00 PM yesterday to personally plant trees. The trees were of two types: weeping willows and willow trees. It was decided that 15,000 trees will be planted along the Gaoqiao seawall this year, with Director Zhao planting the first weeping willow yesterday. Mr. Zhao also proclaimed the slogan "Greening Shanghai" on Tree Planting Day, declaring that efforts must be made to ensure that Shanghai has parks, street trees, and plazas everywhere. "Greening Shanghai" does not cost much money and is of great practical benefit, making it "economical and practical." Mr. Zhao then reported on the progress of the bureau's landscaping work over the past year, briefly stating that the city has more than 20,000 street trees. In addition, Zhongshan Park Botanical Garden has 407 species of famous trees, totaling more than 1,500 trees. The total number of trees in the city's parks is approximately 10,000. This year, on Tree Planting Day, we are planting trees on the seawall, hoping to enhance the beauty of Gaoqiao and to achieve the effect of protecting the seawall.</p>
<p>Beautifying and Protecting the Seawall</p>
<p>Subsequently, Zhu Guoxi, the chief of the structural division, reported on the construction and repair of the seawall, stating that the Public Works Bureau has been actively repairing it for the past two years, and the major gaps have been gradually repaired. A total of more than 5.7 billion yuan has been spent, of which 1.3 billion yuan was allocated by the Executive Yuan. Now that the safety problem of the Gaoqiao seawall has been resolved, the Public Works Bureau's second step will focus on two points: (1) Beautifying the seawall: making it as beautiful as possible for public appreciation. (2) Protecting the seawall: in the past, the seawall embankment was protected, but in the future, the seawall beach will be protected. Chief Zhu continued by saying that planting trees can increase the soil's cohesion and reduce seawater erosion, which can effectively protect the seawall.</p>
<p>Planting Trees by the Seaside in Misty Rain</p>
<p>The Public Works Bureau specially prepared a "Tree Planting Bus," which departed at about 1:00 PM for the Luzupu Rutgers Crossing pier in Rongpu, and crossed the river by truck. The bus arrived at the seaside at about 2:00 PM, when it was drizzling, and the seawall was shrouded in mist. The local gardeners had already dug holes at fixed intervals in the soil. Director Zhao and his party, with smiles on their faces, placed the willow trees into the holes, and then covered them with mud. After the gardeners watered them, the tree planting was completed. The bus then drove along the seawall to inspect the construction and repair work, and returned to Shanghai at 5:00 PM.</p>
<p>Railway Bureau Employees Plant Trees in Nanxiang</p>
<p>In addition, more than 200 representatives from various units of the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway Bureau, including the bureau, special party headquarters, labor union, and colleagues' association, took the No. 76 attached "Tree Planting Bus" to Nanxiang Station at 7:20 AM yesterday to hold a Tree Planting Day Commemorative Meeting.</p>

<h3>One Bowl of Poisoned Noodles Kills Husband: Three Defendants Indicted for Conspiracy to Murder</h3>
<p>[Report from This Newspaper] The case of Wang Zhengsheng, Yang Miaoguiying, and Yuan Jincai being accused of murder was prosecuted by the District Attorney's Office yesterday. Wang Zhengsheng worked as a chef in the kitchen of the No. 15 Cotton Textile Factory in Qiqihar Road, and the female worker Yang Miaoguiying packed meals in the common kitchen. They had an affair, and Yang Miaoguiying had a poor relationship with her husband, Yang Haishu, so they conspired to harm him. On January 6 of this year, Wang asked Yuan Jincai, a cart driver in the workshop, to buy red arsenic and put it in the noodles. Yang ate the noodles and felt abdominal pain when she returned home, and died of poisoning on the 10th. The Yangshupu Police Station transported the body to the autopsy center on Changde Road for examination. The examination confirmed that she had been poisoned. After the prosecutor's investigation, the above three defendants were indicted on suspicion of conspiracy to murder.</p>
<h3>Owner of Yue Opera Theater Commits Suicide Due to Economic Pressure</h3>
<p>[Report from This Newspaper] Yu Xingen, the backstage owner of the Cathay and Empire Yue Opera Theaters, (residence) No. 14 Ximen Lane, Simen Road. At 1:00 PM the day before yesterday, his wife saw that Yu had not yet gotten up and thought he was just sleeping in. She went to the room to urge him to get up, but found him unconscious. She was shocked and immediately flew to Nanyang Hospital, where it was found that Yu had taken poison. Due to prolonged poisoning, there was no way to save him. He died at 4:10 PM. Afterward, the Huashan Road Police Station sent personnel to investigate, and no traces of poisoning were found. The body has now been sent to Tongren Fuyuantang, awaiting inspection by the court. It is reported that Yu Xingen's sudden suicide was due to the sluggish business of the Cathay and Empire theaters, as well as the high contract fees and the sharp increase in venue and performance expenses, resulting in insufficient revenue to cover expenses. Yu owed high-interest loans, accumulating a large debt and lacking the ability to turn the situation around, leading him to resort to this desperate measure.</p>

<h3>Current Status of the West Section Restoration Project After the Opening of the Hangzhou-Southern Section of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Nanchang Correspondent, 10th] After the opening of the Hangzhou-Southern section of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway, the restoration project of the western section has gained more attention from the public. The director of the railway bureau, Hou Jiayuan, previously held an expedited work meeting in Nanchang and decided that the Nanchang to Pingxiang section of the project would be completed by the end of June this year. However, those responsible for track laying and bridge construction believe that the time is short and that the work must be expedited even more. The focus of the problem is still on funding and materials. For example, the steel beams urgently needed for the Zhangshu Ganjiang Bridge, the only large-scale project on the entire line, are still on order from Canada. It is feared that the contracting factory will not be able to deliver this batch of materials at all, because the steel beams for the Liangjiadu Bridge were also ordered from Canada, with the scheduled delivery time being June of last year. However, the steel beams currently used for the Liangjiadu Bridge were in fact pieced together. If the railway bureau or the Ministry of Transportation does not come up with another solution for the materials for the Ganjiang Bridge, this "expedited work" will likely become a problem. Currently, the earthwork project for the roadbed of the Nanchang to Pingxiang section is being carried out in segments. If the steel rails can arrive on schedule, the engineering department plans to start laying the tracks segment by segment from Zhangshu to the east and west. If there are no major obstacles in terms of weather and materials, the track laying project may be completed by the end of June this year, and the opening of the Nanchang to Pingxiang section will depend on the progress of the bridge construction. This reporter departed from Nanchang on the morning of the 4th to visit the Ganjiang Bridge project in Zhangshu and interview Ouyang Cheng, the chief of the third bridge engineering office responsible for the railway, and here is a recorded report on the progress of the five major bridge projects from Nanchang to Pingxiang.</p>
<p>The five major bridges managed by the third bridge engineering office are: Jiaxi Bridge in Nanchang County, Shanqian Bridge on the border of Nanchang and Fengcheng, Ganjiang Bridge in Zhangshu, Ganjiang tributary bridge, and Yuanshui Bridge between Yichun and Pingxiang.</p>
<p>The total length of the creek is 110 meters, divided into ten spans. Except for the steel beams salvaged from the riverbed of the original bridge pier, the remaining steel beams are all old materials from the Shanqian Bridge. Construction started on March 15 of last year, and now 90% of the entire project has been completed. It is expected that it will be fully completed around the 10th of this month.</p>
<p>Shanqian is 44 kilometers from Nanchang, and the bridge crosses the Shanqian River. Crossing from the north bank to the south bank enters Cheng County. A large highway bridge is less than 500 meters downstream from the railway bridge. Construction of this bridge also started on March 20 of last year. By the end of last year, more than 54 tons of salvaged steel beams and rail remnants had been salvaged. The bridge is 176 meters long, and the progress of the project was that the lower part of the project was completed by the end of last year, accounting for 53.5%, and the entire bridge project accounted for 49.9%. This sixteen-span reinforced concrete pier frame bridge is considered a very economical type of project to build a bridge over a small river. There are also quite a few bridges of this type along the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway. This bridge is 176 meters long and is the second largest project in the third district, second only to the Ganjiang and Yuanshui bridges. Eleven spans of the sixteen spans of the "Shanqian" bridge are prepared to use the materials salvaged from the Ganjiang Bridge, which can be barely dealt with by patching together. There are still five spans of steel beams that have not been settled, and it is possible to hope that the Ministry of Transportation will allocate a part of the British military steel beams. The lower part of the Shanqian Bridge was completed by the end of last year, accounting for 53.5%, and the entire bridge project was 49.9%. The entire project is now scheduled to be completed by the end of this month. The Ganjiang Bridge is the Zhangshu Bridge. One is across the main stream of the Ganjiang River, and the other is separated from the main stream bridge by a</p>
<p>small sandbar, so it is called the Ganjiang tributary bridge. The Ganjiang main stream bridge project is the only large bridge on the entire Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway line, with a total length of 549 meters, divided into nine spans, each 60 meters long. During the wartime destruction, there was a locomotive with 25 different types of freight car boxes, in the middle of the bridge. Along with the explosion of the explosives, they fell into the depths of the riverbed, so the reconstruction project, the salvage work, because several years have passed, the car boxes lying at the bottom of the river, steel rails and wartime obstacles, were buried and washed away by sand, some only showed a trace, and some moved their positions. The engineering department estimates that it is necessary to salvage the damaged materials for Yong. There are 2,560 tons of materials in the riverbed of the Ganjiang Bridge. In order to smoothly carry out the salvage work, they cooperated with the Navy Department and asked the Navy to send a part of the salvage personnel to assist in the operation, and hired a batch of "water ghosts" from other places to work underwater. Participate in underwater work</p>
<p>There are now three groups of water ghosts, five people in each group. Regardless of the cold winter rain and snow, they wear a set of rubber waterproof clothing, with an airtight copper hat on their heads, and detect the location and shape of the damaged materials underwater. The land engineering personnel draw salvage blueprints and formulate salvage plans based on their underwater work reports. The work of the "water ghosts" is arduous, but the wages are also quite high. According to the engineering department, the daily wage of each group of five people is 4 million yuan. According to the "water ghosts" report, the salvage project of the Ganjiang Bridge currently has the following positions of the 25 car boxes lying at the bottom of the water: there are four in the third span, six in the fourth span, five in the fifth span, four in the sixth span, two in the seventh span, four in the eighth span, and a locomotive. Nine of them have been salvaged. As of January of this year, the salvage record of the Ganjiang Bridge is: The salvage of the steel beams in the second span is 70%, the fourth span is 46.7%, the fifth span is 48%, and the seventh span is 15%, totaling 95.5 tons of old steel beams salvaged, accounting for 37% of the total. Now the Ganjiang Bridge project has completed 56.5% of the lower part, and the entire bridge has completed 28.8%. The Ganjiang tributary bridge has a total length of 142.9 meters, with four spans, each 39 meters long. Construction started on March 10 of last year, and by the end of the year, the second pier of the large caisson waterproof was completed, one pumping was completed, and 593 cubic meters of damaged concrete were cleared and chiseled from each pier base. 3,400 cubic meters of foundation soil were excavated. In addition to the east and west seats, all were raised above</p>
<p>flood level and the first, third, and second piers were completed, regulating the completion of 50.3% of the lower building project of the entire bridge. The Yuanshui Bridge is the last large bridge in the western section of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway, with a total length of 180 meters, divided into seven spans, each span 25 meters wide. Construction started on April 16 of last year, and by the end of the year, the salvage of all the steel had been completed, with an actual weight of 37.8 tons. As of January, the pumping projects for the fourth and fifth piers had been completed in order, accounting for 14.3% of the total pumping and waterproofing projects. 394.75 cubic meters of damaged concrete were cleared, and 108 cubic meters of foundation soil were excavated. All the clearing and excavation projects were completed. 283 cubic meters of concrete were poured for the first, third, fourth, fifth, and sixth piers, accounting for 14.6% of the total pouring project. At the end of January, 56.02% of the lower part of the entire bridge had been completed. Five spans of the steel beams required for the entire building have been transported to Zhuzhou, and two spans are still in Hangzhou. Based on the current work theory, the Yuanshui Bridge can be completed as scheduled by June. Last year, the third district of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway completed 26.12%. As of the end of February, 42% of the entire project of the above five bridges had been completed. If the track laying project can be completed by the end of June, then if the Ganjiang Bridge project cannot be completed temporarily, the railway bureau is now preparing a plan to possibly use ferries.

<h3>The Aerial Overlord Lands on the Soil of Yangon</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Yangon Correspondent, 10th] The Aerial Overlord landed on the steel-boned runway of the Yangon Airport in the glow of the setting sun, like falling into the furnace of the universe. The hot air swept over the body from all around, making people feel suffocated. Staying in a hotel at night, mosquitoes flew outside the tent, and the electric fan whirred incessantly overhead all night. Although the sweating stopped, the heart was still irritable and uneasy. This season, the golden days of lush grass are flying in Jiangnan; in Yangon, it is climbing towards the peak of the temperature record. Yangon is near the sea, but the sea breeze cannot be blown, so it is not only hot, but also stuffy; not only stuffy, but also humid. These few days are generally above 儿十 degrees at noon, and the hottest days are still to come.</p>
<p>The Price of the Rupee</p>
<p>The tired body was liberated from the cold bath, but was immediately shocked by the high prices. When we handed the clothes we took off to the Indian waiter to wash, he told us: the washing fee for a shirt is two rupees, and the washing fee for underwear is one rupee. What is the ratio of the rupee to the national currency? In Yangon, foreign currency can be said to be completely non-existent. Even the US dollar, which is popular everywhere, is like a hero's end here. The only way is to exchange it at the Bank of China at the official price. One US dollar can only be exchanged for one-third of a rupee. Calculated in this way, the price of washing a shirt and a piece of underwear is about one US dollar! All other prices are also expensive. For example, the hotel we stayed in, the rooms are separated by wooden boards, and the width is less than two zhang (although this is already the largest hotel in Yangon after the war). A room for two people, including three meals, is 35 rupees per day, which is about 10 US dollars. For example, a local overseas Chinese took us to a bar-style dance hall for sightseeing. The entrance ticket was one rupee per person. Six people sat inside for a quarter of an hour and drank three bottles of beer, costing a total of 20 rupees, which is more than six US dollars.</p>
<p>Wandering in the Streets</p>
<p>Walking in the streets of Yangon, what you see is a colorful and unharmonious picture. Although the asphalt-paved streets are smooth, dust and garbage cover its beauty. The wounds of the war still exist. Even in the downtown area, you can see piles of rubble or buildings with only skeletons left. Tall foreign buildings are often next to low, dark mat sheds. There are street stalls everywhere, especially those selling food. Tables and chairs are placed in the open air, and all kinds of rough food are displayed on the tables. Flies are vying with customers to suck. Burmese people wearing red and green sarongs and Indian black charcoal people wearing bare feet and shorts mix into a complicated scene in the street. Although it is colorful, it cannot eliminate the fundamentally gray skin color and gray mood.</p>
<p>At night, the city is sparsely lit, and the dimness is even worse than the South City of Shanghai. We took a car around the city in the sultry air, and couldn't help but miss the trip to Hong Kong the night before. (Reported by Our Reporter Yuan Wenzhong)</p>
<h3>Tree Planting Day: News from Various Places</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Shangrao Correspondent, 10th] On the occasion of Tree Planting Day, various agencies, organizations, schools, etc. of the city are scheduled to gather at Beitoucun Mountain to collectively afforest the land on the morning of this day. The county government is preparing 10,000 seedlings of masson pine for application.</p>
<p>[Report from Our Taixian Correspondent, 10th] To green Taixian County, the county construction section has formulated measures: (1) Mass planting of seedlings in Phoenix Mound and other places near the city; (2) Planting trees on both sides of the highway; (3) Each township will plant a minimum of 5,000 trees, and the seedlings required will be supplied by the county agricultural extension office.</p>
<h3>Inspecting Xuchang: Destruction and Robbery, a Scene of Desolation</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Zhengzhou Correspondent, 8th] Upon arriving in Xuchang, one must first pass through the train station. After its recapture, the first impression upon inspection is the sheer devastation. The station once resembled Shanghai's North Railway Station, but now, the ticket office area is a scene of broken walls and rubble, akin to a deserted city. Although trains still stand in rows, they are mere empty shells, penetrable from any angle. Nearby tracks remain neatly laid, but farther out, they are twisted aside in a series, with no sleepers to be seen. Bridges are collapsed, some with steel bars hanging haphazardly. The Communist bandits thoroughly overturned the railway, deeming it necessary. Some people claim they had specialized tools for railway destruction, supplied by the Soviet Union, which used similar tools to disrupt railways and sever German troops during the defense of Leningrad. However, investigation reveals this is untrue. The bandits merely unscrewed the railway bolts and forced groups of 500 or 1000 civilians to use wooden sticks and ropes to overturn the tracks. They also used similar methods to force civilians to dismantle large houses' pillars and beams. After such destruction, the bandits would have the civilians clap and ask, "Destroyed, isn't it fun?" Within the city, numerous buildings, including several banks, the Senate, and the Guangwen Bookstore, which was targeted by the bandits, were left with only bare walls. The Communist bandits burned the Bank of Communications' furniture on the floor for warmth, resulting in a scorched floor. A church and hospital in Xiguan, while less severely damaged, made it impossible to salvage anything intact. Xuchang, where Cao Cao presented a robe to Guan Yu, is a place where locals hold him in high esteem; however, the statue of Guan Yu in the Guan Emperor Temple was also targeted by the Communist bandits and had its head cut off. On my first day, locals were already reconstructing it. All schools remained intact, leading some to remark that the Communist bandits showed "special favor" to the education sector. This "favor" was spoken with a hint of humor, and after reflection, I interpreted it as "conspiracy." The Communist bandits destroyed the Jianguo Daily, Xudu Daily, and Xuchang Daily, perhaps deeming these news enterprises as not belonging to the realm of culture.</p>
<p>Tobacco Production</p>
<p>During this period, the Communist bandits, under the guise of "bureaucratic capital," seized 82 tobacco factories in Xuchang, though the exact amount remains unconfirmed. It is estimated that the bandits seized 70% of the tobacco leaves produced in the five counties centered around Xuchang. These counties produce at least 150,000,000 catties of tobacco leaves. This year's tobacco harvest is only 40% of the normal yield, which would be 60,000,000 catties, with 70% being 42,000,000 catties. This is, of course, a considerable amount, although a portion was destroyed by fire during the battle at the train station. Food was consumed by the "eating-dry squads" and 60 cartloads were seized, resulting in significant losses. In Xuchang, the Communist bandits robbed under the pretext of "National Traitors." This was the reason used to loot places like the Gongji Hospital, Guangwen Bookstore, and all cooperatives. They also plundered under the guise of "bureaucratic capital," claiming that the capital belonged to a certain army commander or chairman. In one instance, the Taihe Tobacco Factory, the Communist bandits had already driven their vehicles to the door, prepared to move the factory's machinery and transport its technicians. The factory owner, Manager Li, argued with the bandits, who claimed they had received a report stating it was Liu Ruming's tobacco factory. Manager Li demanded evidence, but the bandits only repeated that they had</p>
<p>received a report. As a result, Manager Li argued fiercely with the bandits, who eventually drove their empty vehicles back, because many locals testified that he was a refugee from Changyuan who had started from selling tobacco at a street stall, working his way up to owning a tobacco factory. I visited the factory on my second day in Xuchang, and workers were steaming, curing, and rolling tobacco, with about 30 or 40 workers in total. It is said that the factory had not operated for a single day while the Communist bandits occupied the city. They only resumed operations after the National Army entered the city. Almost all means of transportation were looted, not even a single rickshaw remained. I heard locals say that "The Eighth Route Army" prohibited rickshaw pulling because it involved people pulling people, which was inhumane. I was surprised by this Communist miracle, but after inquiring, I learned that the Communist bandits' method of eliminating rickshaws was to first force them to convert their rickshaws into handcarts, and then order them to transport looted goods to eastern Henan, after which those carts and people disappeared. In the countryside, I asked a donkey owner, "Why do you still have a donkey?" The donkey owner replied, "Isn't it because the 'old eight'嫌(xián - dislike or suspect) it is skinny and sick?" He then told me that the Communist bandits in the villages demanded grain, people, and guns. (Reported by Our Reporter Fan Shiqin)</p>

<h3>Spring Famine in Xuzhou Area</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from our Xuzhou Correspondent, 9th] The severe spring famine is already heavily weighing on the heads of more than four million people in the Xuzhou area. Calculating that it will take another three months until the new wheat of this summer can be eaten, how will these days of suffering and this critical juncture of life and death be overcome? This is truly a critical question for all the starving people in the nine counties and cities of the Xuzhou area and for those who care about this starving population.</p>
<p>On the Longhai Train</p>
<p>In order to understand the spring famine situation in the Fengxiao-Tongshan counties west of Xuzhou, last Thursday, I took a mixed train heading west from Xuzhou-Shangqiu section at 9:00 in the morning. When arriving at Xuzhou North Station, that long train was already crowded with dark-skinned people. Even the carriage steps, hooks, and car roofs were full of people, those places capable of standing. I searched carefully from the front to the back of the train, but could not find any room to stand. Finally, I squeezed onto the guard car after negotiating with the guard. However, the guard car was already full of passengers, so I had to squeeze myself into the compartment. According to people on the train, because the Xuzhou-Shangqiu section had just resumed traffic, there were too many people fleeing to Shangqiu (Shangqiu had a better harvest last fall, with grain prices one-third lower than here), doing small business, and trafficking in grain. Moreover, there was only one train a day, so it was of course extremely crowded, and many passengers were left behind on the platform outside the window as the train departed.</p>
<p>At the Huangkou Station</p>
<p>Three hours later, the train arrived at Huangkou Station. I climbed out of the carriage. At that time, the platform was crowded with people boarding, disembarking, and buying and selling snacks. I stood on the platform and waited for the train to leave the station before walking out of the station. At this time, I discovered that there were more than 300 people at Huangkou Station who wanted to go west but could not get on the train. They were carrying broken cotton wadding luggage and baskets. Among the crowd were elderly women in their eighties and nineties, infants, and women accounting for half of the number. It is said that these are all famine victims from the countryside near Huangkou who want to take the train to Minquan and Shangqiu to escape the famine. A station attendant told me that there are always three to five hundred people on this platform every day taking the train west to escape the famine. More than 20,000 people have left this spring, mostly residents of Xiao County, Feng County, and Tongshan County. These counties suffered severe floods last fall, plus the constant harassment of communist bandits burning, killing, and robbing, leaving the farmers almost destitute. Huangkou Station, this small town, has been robbed three times since the victory. This small town, which originally had a population of more than 5,000 and was quite prosperous, suffered an unprecedented disaster when the Chen bandits harassed the outskirts of Xuzhou in November last year. The eastern half of the residential houses and shops were completely destroyed. Today, only dilapidated walls and half of the town are ruins. Huangkou, after suffering the double disaster of floods and bandits, has now become a desolate scene.</p>
<p>Visiting the District Office</p>
<p>After lunch, I went to visit the District Office of the Eighth District of Xiao County. The District Chief happened to be out in the countryside collecting grain. An assistant named Li said: Xiao County has a total population of more than 670,000. The spring famine caused by this flood and bandit disaster has left 502,993 people in dire need of food, of which 210,369 people are in urgent need of relief, and the disaster situation in the Eighth and Tenth Districts is relatively severe. It is said that in Tangwo, Heilouzi, and other villages more than ten li north of Huangkou Station, eight out of ten residents have abandoned their homes and fled the famine. Now, almost nine out of ten families in the countryside have no grain to eat. Sweet potato leaves, bean cakes, wheat seedlings, and tree bark have become common foods for the masses.</p>
<p>Tasting Wheat Seedling Meal</p>
<p>After leaving the District Office and walking down the street, I met a good friend, Wang Yulin, whom I had not seen for many years. He said sadly, "The disaster situation is already unbearable to see." Then he said: "Relatives in the countryside, whose family has fled the famine, whose daughter has been sent to relatives in Nanjing to be raised as an adopted daughter, whose children have died from eating wheat seedlings and tree bark, and suffering from edema…" As he was speaking, his family's meal was brought out. He insisted that I join him. The meal was corn bread made from bean cake and wheat seedlings. One corn bread was enough for me. Wang Yulin is a middle-class family, and if their meal is like this, how can one not feel sad? After the meal, we went to the nearby countryside to take a walk. In the fields, we could see famine victims digging up wheat seedlings in twos and threes, and women and children peeling tree bark everywhere. When I approached, they all ran away, saying that officials had been sent to ban the digging of wheat seedlings. Some of the children shouted: "I'm digging up wild vegetables!" We looked at the children's backs and sighed, thinking that the wheat seedlings had been dug up this spring, so the wheat harvest this summer would be hopeless, affecting the food supply for the whole year.</p>
<p>Taking the train back to Xuzhou in the evening, my mind was filled with tragic images of refugees. (Special Correspondent for this Newspaper, Zong Chunlin)</p>

<h3>International Exchange of Publications: Fourteen Large Boxes of Chinese Publications Shipped to Europe and America</h3>
<p>[Shenzhou News Agency] The International Exchange Office of Publications of the National Central Library has recently received 42 boxes of books shipped to China by the American Book Center, and another ten boxes are on the way and will arrive soon. In addition, the Belgian government will also ship eight boxes of books to China. These books will be used to exchange for Chinese publications. According to the office, as of the beginning of February this year, 14 large boxes of Chinese books had been packed and shipped abroad, distributed as follows: Denmark one box, Belgium one box, the Netherlands one box, Czechoslovakia two boxes, France one box, the Soviet Union four boxes, and the United States four boxes. Recently, a box of books being shipped to Argentina, containing more than 200 volumes, is undergoing export procedures. The contents include "Interpretations of the Book of Poetry," "Bibliographies of Ming and Qing Dynasty Writings," "Yellow River Flood Control Project," and "Research from the Geological Survey of China." International publication exchange began in 1886, and an international publication exchange convention was established. China joined this convention in 1925, when the Ministry of Education established the "International Exchange Bureau of Publications" in Beijing. Later, it was transferred to the Central Research Institute and then to the Ministry of Education. In August 1945, when the government returned to Nanjing, the Ministry of Education, recognizing the importance of communication between international cultures, directly affiliated the bureau to the Central Library and formally established organizational regulations in July 1946. In addition to fulfilling the international exchange convention, representing the Chinese government in accepting publications from covenant governments, cataloging and storing them in the National Central Library for public viewing, it also collected publications from various government agencies in China and distributed them to covenant countries for exchange.</p>
<h3>American Atomic Scientists Announce New Metal Uranium-233</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, New York, 11th] Atomic scientist Seaborg announced today that the chain reaction of graphite containing graphite in Hanford, Washington, transformed the heavy metal needle into tungsten, initially producing a new metal that can be used for atomic bombs and fuel. This new metal is an isotope of uranium, named "Uranium-233," and is produced in extremely small quantities. Only a few hundred cubic centimeters have been manufactured, and it has no natural source on Earth. It is unknown whether it exists on planets. Currently, extracting the atomic uranium of tungsten may therefore produce more than one type of atomic energy metal, and the application of larger amounts of tungsten metal to atomic bombs is unrealistic.</p>

<h3>Hangzhou Air Force School Basketball Team to Conquer Shanghai – First Battle Tonight Against the U.S. Air Force at 7:30 PM in the Gymnasium</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The Hangzhou Basketball Champion, the Qiao Air Force Officer School basketball team, in order to explore their strength, recently dispatched instructor Yao Zhi to Shanghai to connect with the Basketball Committee, planning to come to Shanghai for an expedition. After proper consultation, the team arrived in Shanghai by train from Hangzhou yesterday and is scheduled to show their skills for the first time tonight at the City Gymnasium. Their first battle will be against the U.S. Air Force, commencing at 6:30 PM at the City Gymnasium. The school's Shanghai match schedule is arranged as follows: 13th against the U.S. Air Force at 6:30 PM, 14th against Encas at 7:30 PM, 15th against a mixed team at 8:30 PM.</p>
<p>The Air Force School is the Wulin champion, with formidable strength. In the Hangzhou Winter Charity Games, they successively defeated strong local teams Qingbai and Chenyou. Although they were defeated by Hualian Dagong, their overall performance is said to be quite remarkable and will be a strong rival in this city. This expedition to Shanghai aims to learn from each other and provide excellent performances.</p>
<p>[Air Force School] Wu Xihong (leader), Shu Hong (advisor), Yao Zhizhong (instructor), Xu Weiyuan (captain) (No. 2), Lu Qing (No. 4), Yuan Shixian (No. 6), You Jianxing (No. 5), Liao Xuewen (No. 2), Sun Huanting (No. 9), Zhu Zhen (No. 7), Zhu Shengyi (No. 8), Qiu Zhongwen (No. 10), Liao Shiwei (No. 11), Lü Huaimin (No. 12).</p>
<p>[U.S. Air Force] Matusky, Palosky, Oer, Lehman, Laquist, Haick, Elit, Pagan, Bowler, Baker-Wheeler. Tonight's basketball league schedule has been slightly changed due to the Hangzhou Air Force School's arrival in Shanghai. The original U.S. Air Force vs. Encas game has been rescheduled with Encas's consent. Admission tickets remain at $30,000/$60,000, with reserved seating inside the venue costing $100,000. The lineup is as follows:</p>
<p>Donghua vs. Yanghang (Division Two B) at 5:30 PM</p>
<p>Air Force School vs. U.S. Air Force (Friendship Match) at 6:30 PM</p>
<p>Hualian vs. Chenyou (Division One A) at 7:30 PM</p>
<p>The first game is Donghua vs. Yanghang. Donghua has won every game in Division Two B, and tonight is their last battle. The whole team has abundant stamina. Yanghang has given up hope for the championship, but their fighting spirit is also strong, and tonight is also their last game.</p>
<p>The second act is the friendship match between the Hangzhou Air Force School and the U.S. Air Force. The visiting team is the Wulin champion, with formidable strength. Liao Xuewen, Xu Weiyuan, You Jianxing, and others are all key players for the team. This expedition to Shanghai was originally intended for further exchanges with Hualian Dagong, but due to the league schedule, the two Hualian teams cannot participate, so they will face the U.S. Air Force instead. The meeting of the Chinese and American Air Forces will be quite a spectacle.</p>
<p>The final act is the Division One A rematch between Hualian and Chenyou. Hualian is undefeated and the championship is almost certainly theirs. However, in the first round, they narrowly defeated Chenyou by one point. Tonight, they meet again, and Chenyou still intends to try again, so there should be a fierce performance.</p>
<h3>Thorny Issues in School Administration – Today's University Guidance (Continued from Yesterday)</h3>
<p>— Sun Daoyuan</p>
<p>The current regulations for the organization of university guidance have raised the qualifications of general guidance personnel (department directors must be associate professors or above, and counselors must be lecturers or above). They have also established Guidance Committees to gather professors to discuss guidance matters. However, these titular professors and lecturers, who have fine reputations but often do not teach students regular courses, are still not valued by students. In reality, the people most respected by students in universities are not the "heads" and "officials" who wield administrative power, but rather professors who possess high moral character and extensive knowledge. Therefore, professors play a decisive role in genuinely proactive guidance in universities. Their daily "words and deeds" and "tendencies" unconsciously serve as guides and role models for the students in the school. Therefore, university guidance is not a formal training, but rather a cultivation of a harmonious collective life, so that it naturally forms an elegant "custom" and "atmosphere." This "custom" and "atmosphere" is what is commonly called "school spirit." "School spirit," more concretely speaking, is the habit of collective living of the entire university. This "habit" is also the unwritten law that university guidance of students follows as a custom; in other words, it is the most perfect social legislation naturally formed in this university society. Not only students must abide by it, but professors must also abide by it. It is the discipline of this group. Therefore, "university life," indirectly speaking, is proactive university guidance. Dewey once said: "Life is education; education is life." If life is done wrong, education is also wrong. Therefore, the proactive role of university guidance is to guide how to live "university life." Contemporary educators should put their minds to practical consideration of this issue, which cannot be summarized by empty abstract words. For example, the ideologies and lifestyles of university students, as well as the coordination between teachers and students, all require very concrete and natural inspiration, so that every young person who steps into the door of the university can gladly accept this new life's cultivation and turn it into a habit that cannot be parted from their lives. Thus, university graduates who have received four years of higher education will almost certainly add a new and vibrant cell to the country when they leave school.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the technical problems in the implementation of university guidance are not merely the problems of the executor and the guided, but rather the problems of the entire school. "Guidance" should be something that the entire school, from top to bottom, consistently follows. Whoever does not abide by it is a degenerate whom everyone abandons. Believing in and acting upon this together, as a matter of habit, will naturally become a life habit that everyone abides by together. Therefore, all guidance facilities in a school should not only be understood by students, but also should be fully known to every faculty and staff member, so that they can consciously and automatically promote it to students anytime and anywhere. They do not need to specially set aside time to assist in "guidance"; as long as they can maintain the meaning of "guidance" in their consistent words and deeds. In this way, "guidance" and "life" are integrated, and teaching and guidance are combined, subtly influencing each university student to embark on the right path without realizing it.</p>
<p>The Responsibility of Guidance</p>
<p>I think that the liberal university education must be matched with the university guidance with the spirit of autonomy. However, in today's universities, the entire responsibility of guidance is placed on a few guidance personnel in a guidance office, and most faculty and staff members are turned into outsiders who are irrelevant bystanders, so that teaching and guidance go their own ways and govern themselves. Although universities have established a student advisor system to make up for this deficiency, the result is still equivalent to a formality due to environmental and factual obstacles. Finally, I offer two principles for the implementation of university guidance today:</p>
<p>"Advocate the Integration of Teaching and Guidance,"</p>
<p>"Implement Life Guidance."</p>
<p>The "Integration of Teaching and Guidance" that I am advocating does not literally mean merging the two departments of teaching and guidance in a school, but rather entrusting "guidance" to "teaching," so that most professors, in addition to teaching, should not forget to "be a teacher and a role model," and should teach tirelessly. Secondly, the so-called "Life Guidance" is that professors with a "demonstration" effect should be able to integrate their lives with the lives of students, in order to implement teaching that is consistent in "body" and "mind," and to break away from all the empty guidance methods of the past where words and deeds did not match. The so-called bodily teaching is tangible teaching; the so-called mental teaching is intangible teaching. Tangible teaching means that all teachers should "lead by example" and be able to lead from the front in everything and be a role model for students in everything. Intangible teaching means that every professor should not only be able to be a compass for "action," but also be able to be consistent in "word" and "deed," and be able to speak and act, and be able to do what they say, to be worthy of being a "good teacher."</p>
<p>Ask Professors for Assistance</p>
<p>However, if we want to practice this universal "Life Guidance," we cannot rely solely on the efforts of the guidance personnel of a school, but must rely on the joint guidance and assistance of all professors, pooling our wisdom and efforts, to achieve effective results. Therefore, advocating "Integration of Teaching and Guidance" is indeed the prelude to implementing "Life Guidance." From the significance of the recent order from the ministry requiring all universities to change "Ethics" to a required course for all students, we can understand that today's education authorities are gradually strengthening the "Integration of Teaching and Guidance." However, reviewing the "Ethics" and "Party Principles" courses, which are most relevant to students' thoughts and behaviors, in today's university curriculum has not achieved the desired effect. The reason for this is that the "implementation of guidance" and the teaching of "Ethics" and "Party Principles" in a school each go their own way and have no connection at all, so that "theory" and "practice" not only cannot be coordinated, but even contradict and contradict each other. How can such guidance, where "knowledge" and "action" cannot be unified, be convincing? The ideal university guidance that we believe in is that "theory" and "practice" must be consistent; the technique for implementing university guidance that we are talking about is that "theory" and "practice" must be coordinated.

<h3>Four Joint Offices Approve Summary of Exchange Settlement for Export Goods – Taking 10% of Total Export Exchange Settlement as the Loan Standard</h3>
<p>In order to promote export trade and increase foreign exchange income, the government, through the foreign exchange bank, the Bank of China, formulated the Summary of Fixed Exchange Settlement Quotas for National Bank Export Goods in the 37th year of the Republic of China, which was submitted to the Four Joint Offices for approval. The main points are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>1. The loan target is limited to export goods that have a definite market abroad, and the types of loan goods may be increased or decreased at any time depending on overseas market conditions.</p>
<p>2. When exporters of the above-mentioned goods apply for loans, they must provide the quantity of export goods and exchange settlement records for the previous year for verification.</p>
<p>3. The loan banks will refer to the exporter's export exchange settlement records for the previous year and determine the estimated total amount of foreign exchange settlement for this year. One-tenth of this estimated exchange settlement amount will be used as the loan standard. Then, it will be converted into the number of national currency according to the benchmark market price of the Balancing Fund at the time of the loan, which will be used as the working capital loan for each bank.</p>
<p>4. The above-mentioned working capital loan is tentatively set for a valid period of six months. The maximum loan period is one month each time, and it can be done repeatedly. However, the exporter must sell the export bill of exchange to the loan bank to repay the loan every month when it is due. The export bill of exchange sold shall be no less than one-tenth of the estimated total amount of foreign exchange sold for this year.</p>
<p>5. If the exporter fails to fulfill the monthly exchange settlement conditions for the export bill of exchange, the loan bank may purchase the collateral at the loan price in accordance with the government's export goods purchase measures, and use the purchase price to pay off the loan principal and interest.</p>

The proposals discussed included: (A) the draft implementation plan for manufacturing 100,000 spindles formulated by the National Cotton Yarn and Cloth Management Committee of the Ministry of Economic Affairs. The plan is as follows: (1) the number of spindles to be manufactured (100,000 spindles, with 20-count yarn as the standard); (2) the completion deadline is one year (from June 1948 to May 1949); (3) the selection of the 10,000 spindles of textile machinery to be matched, and the style; (4) the grouping and division of labor for machinery manufacturing [100,000 spindles will be divided into ten groups, each group with 10,000 spindles as a unit, to be contracted by dividing the work; it is planned to entrust 18 companies such as Shengsheng Ironworks]; (5) the accounting of labor and materials; (6) the acceptance of the machinery; (7) the supply of power, etc.  (B) The Central Machinery Corporation of the Resources Committee proposed that the Ministry of Economic Affairs apply to the Four Banks Joint Office for a special loan to order 100,000 spindles of spinning machines and 3,000 looms annually to promote the industry, and to stipulate important dimensions of textile machinery to meet standards and facilitate manufacturing.  (C) Pan Yangshan, Chairman of the Chongqing Industrial Association, proposed to seize the time to increase cotton yarn production as early as possible, and to order the entire output for two to three years from domestic manufacturers who are already capable of manufacturing complete sets of yarn mill machinery.  (D) Zhu Xianfang proposed to organize a joint venture textile machinery manufacturing company.  (E) Gu Yaoqiu proposed, in order to promote the realization of the textile industry construction plan and save the crisis of private mechanical industry, to request the government to allocate special funds, or take 10% of the proceeds from the sale of the China Textile Company as special funds, and use the form of order loans to entrust private machinery factories to manufacture textile machinery, etc., totaling six items. The Ministry of Economic Affairs proposed eight items, as follows: (1) to stipulate the style and dimensions of textile machinery in China, make blueprints, and require all factories manufacturing textile machinery in the country to uniformly follow and adopt them; (2) to formulate the standards for textile machine parts and unify their names; (3) to determine the conditions that textile machinery manufacturing factories should possess; (4) to review the manufacturing capabilities of existing domestic textile machinery manufacturing factories, and divide the total quantity of textile machinery listed in the textile machinery construction plan agreed upon at the National Textile Industry Production Conference to be contracted by each factory; (5) to discuss the types and quantities of textile machinery to be imported from abroad; (6) to coordinate the raw materials for manufacturing textile machinery; (7) to define the inspection standards for textile machinery manufactured in China. Due to the large number of proposals, the conference will be extended for one day today (the 13th).</p>
<p>Yesterday, at the textile machinery manufacturing conference convened by the Ministry of Economic Affairs, the reporter met Minister of Economic Affairs Chen Qitian and inquired about the progress of the ministry's five-year plan for the textile industry in the past six months. Mr. Chen replied that there are currently no concrete facts to report, and everything is still in the preparation stage. Promoting the textile industry, the preparation work in the preparation period is the most important. If all relevant issues can be resolved during the preparation period, it will be very easy to achieve good results when promoting. The textile machinery conference convened this time is one of the preparation works. In short, the Ministry of Economic Affairs will spare no effort to promote this plan and strive to gradually realize it within five years.</p>
<h3>Silk Prices All Retreat</h3>

Selling was greater than buying, and asking prices frequently decreased. At the noon close, forward delivery was trading at 17 million yuan. The afternoon continued the downward trend, dropping from 15 million yuan to a selling price of 20.06 million yuan, a drop of 27 million yuan compared to the previous day.</p>
<p>Factory-reeled silk also declined yesterday. In the morning, C-grade transactions occurred at a price of 290 million yuan, a premium of 8.5 million yuan over high-grade short-term tickets. High-grade short-term tickets were offered at around 240 million yuan, but no transactions took place. In the afternoon, due to the sharp fall in artificial silk, market sentiment weakened, and transactions were very few. Asking prices for all grades were slightly softer than in the morning.</p>
<h3>Tight Money, Rising Prices;  White Rice Sees New High</h3>
<p>Although the rice market saw a slight recovery the day before yesterday, it was only a flash in the pan. Yesterday, the price of white rice in the North Market rose to 3.88 million yuan, and the price of premium rice reached a new high of 3.98 million yuan, only 20,000 yuan away from the 4 million yuan mark. Each rose sharply by 100,000 and 120,000 yuan compared to the previous day. Pu rice was 3.8 million yuan, and high-quality sheep rice traded at 3.9 million yuan, higher than the previous day by 100,000 yuan. Other varieties such as fragrant rice and white rice also increased by about 100,000 yuan each. In the South Market, the morning market saw the strongest rise. White rice opened at 3.85 million yuan, an increase of 200,000 yuan. Thin rice and other varieties also followed. However, due to the tight money supply and the impact of household rice, "Naluqi" was weak and then declined. White rice finally traded at 3.75 million yuan, the same price as thin rice, an increase of 100,000 and 50,000 yuan respectively. Yesterday's rise was still due to the rise in Wuxi. Also, the sharp rise in various non-agricultural products was also a reason for the rise. Yesterday, 2,514 piculs arrived in the South Market and 6,802 piculs in the North Market, totaling 9,316 piculs.</p>
<h3>Woolen Cloth Trading Quiet, "Van Lidding" Goods Flood the Market</h3>
<p>Yesterday, there were not many wholesale transactions of woolen cloth at the inspection tea party. Retail business in the Qipan Street shops was also quiet. The number of clothes currently being made in men's and women's clothing stores in various districts is limited. Under high prices, purchasing power is weakening one after another. "Van Lidding" woolens have recently continued to appear on the market. First-grade is offered at 2.56 million yuan per yard, second-grade at 2.12 million yuan, and third-grade at 1.67 million yuan. There are many patterns of striped and solid colors, but very few actual transactions, because the products of large and small factories are flooding the market, and those processed by Yihe Factory are piled up like mountains. With a large number of chips currently being prepared, both buyers and sellers are apprehensive, and most are adopting a slow-paced approach to avoid wasting interest in vain.</p>
<h3>Consolidated Bonds Continue to Rise, Foreign Stocks Step Down</h3>
<p>Government bonds reached new highs again yesterday, with a stable and consistent process, and trading increased to more than six million. Consolidated Bonds C opened strongly at 12,000, rising to 13,000 before settling slightly. 555, 500, and 614 rose, while 503, 552, and Chengde declined. Compared to the previous close, A, B, and E each rose 4,000 yuan, Consolidated Bonds C rose 8,000 yuan, and Consolidated Bonds D rose 7,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Foreign stocks suddenly fell sharply yesterday, with many significant declines. Securities firms and Guangdong firms were selling heavily, foreign merchants' profits were greatly reduced, and except for British-China and Telephone, which fell slightly, all were weak. Yi Yarn opened in the morning at 1.9 million, rising from 1.91 million, gradually declining to around 1.73 million before stopping. Compared to the previous close, Shipping fell 20%, Yi Yarn, Guangyi, Steel Industry, and Langel's each fell 10% to 15%, British Federation and Jardine Matheson fell 5%, and Telephone British-China declined.</p>
<h3>Galvanized Iron Wire in Imported Goods with Self-Provided Foreign Exchange Not Allowed to be Re-exported; Collection Deadline Extended</h3>
<p>[This newspaper's report] The Review Committee for the Purchase of Goods Arriving with Uncertified Self-Provided Foreign Exchange held a routine meeting on the 11th. The China Trust Bureau had previously issued Public Notice No. 11, stating that galvanized iron wire arriving and already shipped with self-provided foreign exchange would be purchased by the bureau on behalf of the government and would not be allowed to be re-exported. However, because the original invoices for this iron wire often do not specify the wire gauge, and the British and American standards are not, it is difficult for the Export-Import Management Committee to make prior statements when issuing import licenses. It was decided that in order to facilitate the issuance of licenses and the progress of the purchase work, all galvanized iron wire under Customs Tariff No. 205 arriving with self-provided foreign exchange, regardless of gauge, would not be allowed to be re-exported and would be purchased by the China Trust Bureau on behalf of the government.  The duplicate bill of lading and invoice would then be submitted to the Ministry of National Defense, which would send personnel to the warehouse to physically inspect the goods. If they were needed, they would be issued; if not, they would still be handed over to the bureau for priority purchase by the direct users of the original orders, and to facilitate importers' applications for purchase, the purchase deadline would be extended to 70 days from the date of the bureau's Public Notice No. 11 on February 14.  All original importers should promptly apply to the Export-Import Management Committee's Import Quota Allocation Office for purchase in accordance with the prescribed procedures within this deadline.</p>
<h3>Bulls All Emerge, Chinese Stocks Gradually Decline</h3>
<p>Chinese stocks retreated sharply yesterday after being bullish, spending most of the time in a sluggish state. All the bulls in the securities firms emerged, external stimulation was greatly reduced, the dark interest rate increased to beyond three corners, and gradually declined, ending the close at a low price.</p>
<p>At the morning opening, the news of the Four Banks Joint Office's production loans caused prices to rise, and Yong Yarn went on the market at prices of 5,100 yuan and 1,600 yuan, rising to 1,508 yuan and 1,603 yuan after the opening. With tight money and dark interest rates rising to three and a half corners, securities firms were actively cutting long positions. Except for Xinyi, which rose to the limit, all saw declines. Although there were occasional rises and falls in the middle, individual investors were pressed for time, and the industry did not add support, falling to low prices of 1,420 yuan and 1,523 yuan near noon. The noon close was 1,432 yuan and 1,532 yuan. As a result, compared to the previous close, except for Xinyi, which rose to the limit, the spot delivery stocks of Yong Yarn, Huaxin, and China Silk fell slightly. Underwear, China Textile, and Yonggong were each lower by 10% to 15%, and the rest fell by about 5%. Forward delivery stocks, Meyer and Xinhuo, fell by 5%, and the rest fell slightly.</p>
<p>After the market opened from 1,450 yuan and 1,530 yuan, they were gradually sold to 1,420 yuan and 1,505 yuan. News reports mentioned the intensification of aid to China, and they retreated to 1,412 yuan and 1,490 yuan. Although 190 and 183 rose, 145, 71, and 154 were still sold, retreating further to low prices of 1,408 yuan and 1,490 yuan. The closing price was 1,410 yuan and 1,493 yuan. Except for Xinyi, which still stood at the limit, all declined. Compared with the morning close, Xinyi rose to the limit, Firecracker and Jinglun were flat, China Textile and Underwear rose slightly, and the rest declined slightly. Forward delivery stocks, Huafeng, fell by 5%, and the rest fell slightly. Various unlisted stocks outside the market remained stable, with Jiaotong, Huashang, Nanyang, Dasheng, and Guanshengyuan each rising by 5%.</p>
<h3>Central Bank Issues Bonuses for Cracking Down on Gold Speculation</h3>
<p>[This newspaper's report] It was recently learned from the Central Bank that in Shanghai, in order to crack down on the illegal trading of gold, all physical objects seized by military and police agencies will be transferred to the bank for safekeeping. After the confiscation is confirmed, the bank will advance the bonus to the seizing agencies and informants. Since its implementation, rewarding informants has been effective. Regarding the bonuses to be awarded for cracking down on the illegal trading of gold in Tianjin, Hankou, Guangzhou, and other places, the bank will also be allowed to issue them according to the Shanghai regulations.</p>
<h3>Tea Firms Telegraph Four Banks Joint Office to Allocate Loans for Crude Tea</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Tea Trade Association telegraphed the Nanjing Four Banks Joint Office yesterday to apply for loans for crude tea, stating that the association's members engage in the business of purchasing, transporting, and selling tea. Every tea season, they go to the producing areas to set up purchasing stations. The tea they collect, in addition to supplying domestic sales, also provides crude tea raw materials to more than 30 tea factories in Shanghai, which are made into boxed tea for export. Taking last year as an example, the total amount of boxed tea exported was more than 260,000 piculs, half of which came from loans, and a part of the raw materials was supplied by tea firms. Therefore, the tea firms, tea manufacturing, and export industries are interdependent. The association's members received loans from the Four Banks Joint Office the year before last, which enabled them to maximize the effectiveness of their purchases. Last year, however, due to a late application, they were informed that tea loans had been gradually terminated and it was difficult to comply, etc. Tea production is most elastic; the more purchasers there are, the higher the tea farmers' interest, and the more production there is. If overseas sales are brisk, tea firms' crude tea can be used entirely as raw materials for export. Recently, this year's new tea will soon be on the market. How to provide loans to encourage increased production must be within the overall planning of the head office. However, wages in the producing areas are high, and the cost of crude tea has increased sharply. With tea merchants' financial resources, it is difficult to carry out purchasing work. Therefore, it is proposed to allocate some crude tea loans under the entire tea loan item in accordance with previous precedents to meet the needs of the association's more than 60 members for purchasing raw materials for boxed tea.</p>
<h3>Yarn and Cloth Price Increase Slightly Eased; Asking Prices All Fall</h3>
<p>Yesterday's cotton yarn market saw prices rising in the morning due to rising external market reports and strong interest from both local and external buyers, with asking prices remaining firm. However, as the monetary situation tightened both inside and outside the industry and the distribution period for yarn from the Textile Construction Company approached, and prices had been rising sharply for several days, people were uneasy. Short-term traders sensitive to their cash positions were the first to take advantage of the high prices and sell, causing the market atmosphere to relax. All parties stopped advancing and turned to selling, and short-sellers took the opportunity to become active. Buyers also became sluggish. Many profitable bulls sold off one after another, and asking prices gradually fell. Finally, 42-count Blue Phoenix yarn closed at a low price of 177 million yuan, a decrease of 3 million yuan compared to the previous day. Bingguang and Jincheng brands also dropped by 3 to 4 million yuan. For 20-count yarns, prices declined slightly from 500,000 to over 1 million yuan, because buyers were willing to absorb at low prices. Other coarse and fine yarns such as 10-count, 16-count, and 32-count also declined by 1.4 to 1.5 million yuan to 2 to 3 million yuan.</p>
<p>The cotton cloth market saw strong demand from individual traders and a few purchases from large traders at the opening, and prices rose again. Longtou fine cloth even surged to the 4 million yuan mark. However, due to a large number of spot sales from Hankou and Northern traders, and as individual traders saw that sales were turning sluggish, many also sold. Furthermore, the Textile Construction Company released a large number of chips, and cloth merchants competed to sell due to tight credit conditions in the industry and concerns about high prices. Buyers adopted a wait-and-see attitude, and the market was filled with cries of "sell," so prices began to fall. 12-pound Longtou fine cloth fell straight to a closing price of 3.73 million yuan, but it was still an increase of 10,000 yuan compared to the previous day. Wufu and Yanghe brands also rose by 25,000 yuan. Blue Crane and Caiqiu saw mixed rises and falls. In addition, coarse cloth, bleached cloth, fine twill, and colored cloth were still selling actively, and the market was still bullish. Due to insufficient supply from manufacturers, Shilin cloth rose gradually by 300,000 to 400,000 yuan to 600,000 to 700,000 yuan. Other varieties such as broadcloth, Zhigong, and Nafuto were trending in a sluggish state.</p>
<h3>Kerosene and Candles Rise Repeatedly</h3>
<p>The kerosene market continued to rise due to the continuous reports of shrinking supply from Hong Kong, and wholesale transactions among traders were frequent. High-grade barrel goods traded at 16.7 million yuan, and Mobil and Asia Oil in tins rose to 2 million yuan. Retail prices increased to 45,000 yuan per can, and limited-price oil remained at 25,000 yuan per catty.</p>
<p>Candles, due to the scarcity and high price of raw material oils and fats, increased costs, and strong sales, with external parties also absorbing supplies, caused prices to rise repeatedly. Wholesale prices for Whiteley's Ship brand rose to 2.7 million yuan per case, Monk's Hat to 2.8 million yuan, Chicken brand to 2 million yuan, and Camel and Red Fortune to 1.78 million yuan.</p>
<h3>Oils and Fats Rise</h3>
<p>Oils and fats, which are used extensively in industry, saw reduced allocations of oils, fats, and waxes to soap manufacturers in the Fourth District by the Industry and Commerce Guidance Office, resulting in a shortage of raw materials and a panic in the soap industry. The industry has a strong need for tallow raw materials. In addition to the association submitting a document to the authorities to appeal, it is also searching the market and absorbing supplies strongly. Asking prices have risen, with Qingdao and Zhapu sources of supply unable to keep up, and market inventories are weak. Tallow is priced as high as 15 million yuan, with recent noon prices being 4 million yuan. Coconut oil soared to 24 million yuan per dan, Boshan Wo Ben to 11 million yuan, and snow-melt and orchid oil to 10.35 million yuan. All oils continued to rise by 10% to 20%.</p>
<h3>Chinese Medicine Gradually Rises</h3>
<p>Since the increase in freight, Chinese medicine has risen repeatedly. Grade 1 old-picked frankincense has reached a new high of 700,000 yuan. Taichang agastache is 240,000 yuan, Qingjia slices are 260,000 yuan, Fuji chuanxiong is 120,000 yuan, Chuanxiong King is 110,000 yuan, Diaochuanxiong is 100,000 yuan, Rehmannia root is 85,000 yuan, and Tianjin Fangfeng is 180,000 yuan, with a strong upward trend. All are due to exchange rate fluctuations, increased freight costs, and higher foreign exchange rates.</p>
<h3>Taiwanese Dollar Exchange Rate Increased to 1:189 Yuan</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Taipei, 12th] The exchange rate between the Taiwanese dollar and the legal tender will be increased to 1:189 yuan starting from the 12th.</p>
<h3>China Farmers' Bank Will Convene Branch Meeting to Discuss Promoting Agricultural Loan Program</h3>
<p>[This newspaper's report] After the total agricultural and land finance loan amount for this year, totaling 15 trillion yuan, was formally approved by the board of directors of the Four Banks Joint Office on the 11th, Mr. Li Shuming, General Manager of the China Farmers Bank, who attended the meeting, returned to Shanghai from Nanjing on the morning of the 12th. According to Mr. Li, the focus of the Farmers Bank's work and the economic future will be on increasing agricultural production, using effective methods to ensure that funds reach the hands of farmers directly, and further improving agricultural loan methods to ensure they are sound. The implementation steps will be to convene a meeting of branch managers and agricultural loan management personnel from all over the country in the coming days to announce the industry's planned promotion plan and adopt opinions for a systematic discussion in order to implement the task and achieve significant results. Mr. Li emphasized whether the implementation of agricultural loans would affect the market. He emphasized that these loans must be carried out by month and province, with a longer time frame and a vast area. The actual recipients will be in rural areas, and they will be isolated from the market. Even in the peak season for agricultural loans, it will be no more than about 3 trillion per month. Finally, he traced the drafting of this plan to its beginning in November of last year, with more than ten revisions before the final draft was completed. The important points of the content include the implementation period, taking into account the supply of funds from the National Bank, and how to ensure that farmers benefit directly.</p>
<h3>To Prevent Import and Export Smuggling; China-Macau Agreement Implemented Today; Export-Import Management Committee Announces Seven Categories of Goods for Which Import and Export Certificates Must Be Submitted</h3>
<p>According to a spokesman for the Central Bank, since the Sino-Hong Kong Financial Agreement was signed, representatives of the Central Bank and the Macao government have completed consultations. In the spirit of cooperation and goodwill, after careful and precise discussions, they agreed to implement the following measures similar to the Sino-Hong Kong Agreement. Starting today, major export goods from China, such as antimony, bristles, cotton yarn, tea, tin, tungsten, and various vegetable oils, including tung oil and rapeseed oil, transported through Macao for re-export must be submitted with a certificate proving that the foreign exchange earned from the export of the goods from China has been sold or agreed to be sold to designated banks within China. Otherwise, the Macao government will not allow re-export. Starting from the same date, goods transported from Macao to China, if their value exceeds 200 patacas or its equivalent, must first present an import license issued by the Export-Import Management Committee of China. Otherwise, the Macao government will not allow its export. The Macao government also prohibits carrying more than 5 million yuan of national currency in cash into the mountains. This measure is the same as the current restrictions on the shipment of cash by the Chinese and Hong Kong governments. The above measures provide valuable assistance to the management of China's foreign exchange and import and export trade, making the implementation of the Sino-Hong Kong Financial Agreement more stringent. The Chinese government can prevent the loss of foreign exchange due to export smuggling.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Export-Import Management Committee issued Public Notices No. 25 and 26 for the China-Macau Agreement as follows: "It has been determined that the authorities in China and Macau have agreed that starting from March 13, 1948 (1) antimony, (2) bristles, (3) cotton yarn, (4) tea, (5) tin, (6) tungsten ore, and (7) various vegetable oils (i.e., tung oil, rapeseed oil, cinnamon oil, star anise oil, castor oil, cottonseed oil, sesame oil, perilla oil, tea oil), etc., of these seven categories of goods, those re-exported, transshipped, or transported from Macao must submit a (C.BC.8a revised) certificate to the Macao authorities proving that the foreign exchange obtained from the loading of the goods from our country to Macao has been sold or agreed to be sold to the designated banks in the country. In the future, exporters must fill out the 'C.B.C.8a revised' certificate in five copies for the above-mentioned goods shipped from the country to Macau or transshipped through Macau. After the certificate is certified by the designated bank in the country, it will still be submitted to the customs in accordance with the usual procedures, and one copy will be stamped by the customs and returned to the original applicant for safekeeping and shipped with the goods to Macau for verification by the Commissioner of Customs of Gongbei. If the goods need to be transshipped from Macau in the future, they should also be submitted to the Macau authorities for inspection.</p>
<p>"It has been determined that the authorities in China and Macau have agreed that for goods shipped from Macao to our country, if their value exceeds 200 Macao patacas (or the equivalent in other currencies), the original import license issued by this committee for the goods must first be presented to the Macao authorities; otherwise, the Macao authorities will not release them. After the necessary procedures for the above regulations have been completed, the original of the import license will be returned to the exporter by the Macao authorities.</p>

<p>Cultural History</p>
<h3>Examining the Age of Completion of the *Shui Jing Zhu*</h3>
<p>— Hu Shi</p>
<p>The author of the *Shui Jing Zhu*, Li Daoyuan, died in the third year of Tuoba Wei Xiaochang (527 AD), which was the first year of the Datong era of Emperor Wu of Liang. The year in which the *Shui Jing Zhu* was completed is unknown, but the book occasionally mentions contemporary historical events and figures related to the author. This kind of material should help us determine the year in which Li Daoyuan wrote the book. Unexpectedly, scholars of the past instead suspected these contemporary historical facts, saying that they were added in by later generations. He Zhuo, Zhao Yiqing, and others all held such suspicions, but in fact, these were all due to their own occasional erroneous research.</p>
<p>For example, Volume 28 of the *Shui Jing Zhu* quotes a line from Wu Jun's poem "Sword." He Zhuo said:</p>
<p>"Daoyuan and Wu Jun were contemporaries, how could he quote his poem? I suspect that this book has many additions by later generations." Zhao Yiqing's *Shui Jing Bian Shi* (28, leaf 2) says:</p>
<p>"According to the *History of the Southern Dynasties*, Wu Jun was appointed as a registrar by Liu Yun, who was serving as the governor of Wuxing during the early years of the Tianjian era. At the time of Daoyuan, Wu Jun's position and reputation were still low, and his writings may not have circulated outside of the Jiangnan region. Yi Men's words can be considered insightful."</p>
<p>Neither of these two pieces of research can be considered "insightful." The *Book of Liang*, in its biography of Wu Jun, records that he died in the first year of the Putong era of Emperor Wu of Liang (520 AD) at the age of fifty-two, which was seven years before Li Daoyuan's death. Both the *Book of Liang* and the *History of the Southern Dynasties* say that Wu Jun's poems were "imitated by enthusiasts at the time, and called the Wu Jun style," indicating that his poems were very popular. At that time, the literary works of the Northern and Southern Dynasties circulated easily between each other, so the *Shui Jing Zhu* often quotes Shen Yue's *History of the Song Dynasty*, and also quotes Wang Zhishen's *History of the Song Dynasty* (Volume 25). Even historical records could circulate outside of the Jiangnan region, let alone poems? Therefore, it is not at all strange that Li Daoyuan quoted Wu Jun's line of poetry.</p>
<p>Another example is in Volume 28 of the *Shui Jing Zhu*, under the entry for Juchao County, there is a note about "Zhao Zu's City" and "Hu Jing's City." Zhao Yiqing's *Shui Jing Zhu Jian Kan Wu* 10, leaf 25, says that "Hu City" should be "Hu Jing City." He also says:</p>
<p>"In the fourth year of the Tianjian era of the Liang Dynasty, the Liang Dynasty invaded Wei's Hefei. Hu Jing and Zhao Zuyue were in the same army and had a feud, which Wei Dan resolved. This matter is recorded in the biography of Wei Dan in the *History of the Southern Dynasties*. However, there is a great deal of doubt about this. The fourth year of the Tianjian era of the Liang Dynasty was the first year of the Xiaochang era. The following year, Daoyuan was murdered in Yinpan. Who knows when the book was completed? How could he take the building of cities by Hu and Zhao as evidence?… This is the same mistake as… quoting Wu Jun's poetry."</p>
<p>This passage has three major errors. (1) The fourth year of the Tianjian era of the Liang Dynasty was 505 AD, while the first year of the Xiaochang era of the Wei Dynasty was 525 AD, a difference of twenty years. How can it be said that the fourth year of the Tianjian era was the first year of the Xiaochang era! (2) Li Daoyuan died in the third year of the Xiaochang era (527 AD), so it cannot be said that it was "the following year." (3) The exact year in which Zhao Zuyue and Hu Jing built their cities is unknown. If they built the cities in the fourth year of the Tianjian era, then that would be twenty-two years before Daoyuan's death. It is not at all strange that the *Shui Jing Zhu* mentions these place names.</p>
<p>Another example is in Volume 32 of the *Shui Jing Zhu*, in the note for "Huai County, Jiangxia," Zhao Yiqing says:</p>
<p>"According to the *Book of Sui Geography*, the Liang Dynasty established the three prefectures of Mianyang, Yingyang, and Zhoucheng, and the two counties of Zhouling and Huiwan. … Daoyuan died in the second year of the Xiaochang era, only five years after the first year of the Tianjian era! Who knows when the book was completed, but how could he suddenly mention the establishment of the new dynasty in Jiangnan? This was added in by later generations, which can be mutually verified with the quote of Wu Jun's poetry in the note on the Mian River." (*Shui Jing Zhu Shi* 32, leaf 15)</p>
<p>Here, there are three more major errors. (1) Daoyuan died in the third year of the Xiaochang era, not the second year, as mentioned earlier. (2) The first year of the Tianjian era (502) was twenty-five years before the third year of the Xiaochang era, not just five years apart! (3) Zhao accidentally misquoted the *Book of Sui Geography* and did not compare it with earlier histories. For example, under the entry for the governor of Yingzhou in the *Book of Song Geography*, there is</p>
<p>"Grand Administrator of Jiangxia"</p>
<p>"Huiwan, Xiang of the tenth, Jiangzuo's."</p>
<p>"Grand Administrator of Baling"</p>
<p>"Zhouling, Xiang of the state, old county of the Han."</p>
<p>Similarly, in the *History of the Southern Dynasties Geography*, the Jiangxia Prefecture of Yingzhou has Huiwan County, and the Baling Prefecture has Zhouling County. Therefore, it is not at all strange that Daoyuan mentioned the Huiwan and Zhouling counties.</p>
<p>I now want to point out the latest historical fact recorded in the *Shui Jing Zhu* so that everyone knows that the writing of this immortal work by Li Daoyuan was probably completed in the author's later years, not far from his death—perhaps the book was not completely finished when he was murdered.</p>
<p>Li Daoyuan often tells us some biographical material about himself in his book. For example, in the Ru River section, he says:</p>
<p>"In the fourth year of the Yanchang era, I was appointed as the governor of Eastern Jingzhou."</p>
<p>The fourth year of the Yanchang era is equivalent to the fourteenth year of the Tianjian era (515), only twelve years before Daoyuan's death.</p>
<p>*Shui Jing Zhu* Volume 26, Shu River section:</p>
<p>"The Shu River flows south again, passing west of Jianling Mountain. During the Zhengguang era of the Wei Dynasty, when the King of Qi was stationed in Xuzhou, he built a large dam to divert the water westward. The Two Canals, where cities were established for defense, curved around Shushui. From the dam, it flows thirty li westward, pouring into the old course of the Shu River, which is called the New Canal." Here, "Jianling Mountain" was originally written as "Lingshan," and "Zhengguang" was written as "Zhengwan." Zhao Zai changed both of them to "Jianling Mountain" and "Zhengguang." Zhao's Zhu Jian Kan Wu 9, leaf 35, says:</p>
<p>"This is an event from the Zhengguang era of Emperor Xiaoming of the Tuoba Wei Dynasty. The King of Qi was Xiao Huan. The biography of Xiao Bin in the *History of Wei* says: 'During the Shengui era (518-519), he was appointed as the commander of military affairs for the two prefectures of Xu and Southern Yan, General of Chariots and Cavalry, and Governor of Xuzhou… In the second year of the Zhengguang era (521), he was summoned as the Grand General of Cavalry.'" The biography of Xiao Hui also mentions the construction of the dam, but not during the Zhengguang era. The biography says:</p>
<p>"When the Empress Dowager Ling came to power (the fourth year of the Zhengchang era, which is the fourteenth year of the Tianjian era, 515), [Xiao Bin] returned to the capital. Xiao Yan (Emperor Wu of Liang) sent his general Kang Xuan to dam the Huai River at Fushan to irrigate Yang and Xu. Xiao Bin was appointed as an imperial envoy, commander of all military affairs for the Eastern Expedition, and stationed in Pengcheng to attack him. At the beginning of the Xiping era, after the city was completed, the Huai River overflowed, causing a disaster for Pengcheng. Xiao Bin diverted the Huai River above the dam, and the water was slightly reduced."</p>
<p>According to Kang Xuan's biography in the *Book of Liang*, the Fushan dam project began in the twelfth year of the Tianjian era (the third year of the Yanchang era of the Wei Dynasty, 514) and was completed in the fourth month of the fifteenth year of the Tianjian era (the first year of the Xiping era, 516). That year, "in the autumn, in the eighth month, the Huai River flooded, and the dam was completely destroyed, flowing into the sea."</p>
<p>The record of the ninth year of the *History of Wei*, the Xiaoming Emperor's chronicle, clearly distinguishes two matters.</p>
<p>"In the fourth year of the Yanchang era (515), in the first month, Emperor Xiaoming ascended the throne. In the ninth month, the Empress Dowager personally took control of the government. In the ninth month, on the day of Guihai, an edict was issued… appointing Xiao Bin, the governor of Jizhou, as General Zhen Dong to dam the Huai River."</p>
<p>"In the first year of the Xiping era (516), in the second month, on the day of Yiwei, Zhen Dong Xiao Bin greatly defeated Xiao Yan's generals north of the Huai River… In the ninth month, on the day of Dingchou, the Huai dam broke, and over one hundred thousand people in the cities, garrisons, villages, and settlements along the Huai River were swept into the sea." Daoyuan was a contemporary witness and a geographer, so we should believe his record and determine that Xiao Bin's construction of the dam was not before the Fushan dam was destroyed, but after it; the event took place "during the Zhengguang era, when the King of Qi was stationed in Xuzhou," around the first year of the Zhengguang era (520). This is the latest historical event recorded in the *Shui Jing Zhu*. Seven years later, Li Daoyuan was murdered.</p>
<p>Xiao Hui murdered Li Daoyuan's entire family in the third year of the Xiaochang era (527). The *Shui Jing Zhu*, Huai River section, mentions the Fushan dam:</p>
<p>"The Huai River flows east again, passing Fushan, with the steep Stone Mountain facing it to the north. During the Tianjian era of the Liang Dynasty, a dam was built between the two mountains, violating the heart of heaven and the hopes of the people and gods, so it naturally collapsed."</p>
<p>This event was eleven years before Li Daoyuan's death. The *Shui Jing Zhu*, Shu River section, records "during the Zhengguang era, when the King of Qi was stationed in Xuzhou," which was six or seven years before Li Daoyuan's death. Li Daoyuan recorded these two events very clearly. The *History of Wei* mistakenly records two events that were four or five years apart as happening in the same period.</p>
<p>*Shui Jing Zhu* Volume 35, note says:</p>
<p>"The Ju River originates from Turtle Head Mountain and flows northwest, passing south of Yilong Garrison, the seat of Liang Dynasty's Ding Prefecture, where the barbarian chief Chu Xiu served as governor… The Ju River flows southwest again, passing east of the two prefectures of Si and Yu in the Liang Dynasty, where the barbarian chief Lu Lusheng served as governor, governing the Lake Slope City, also called the Water City."</p>
<p>According to the *Book of Liang* 22, biography of Xiao Xiu, Prince of Ancheng, in the thirteenth year of the Tianjian era (514), Xiao Xiu was appointed as an imperial envoy, attendant in ordinary service, commander of the military affairs of the three prefectures of Ying, Si, and Huo, General of the Western Pacification, and Governor of Ying Prefecture. The biography says:</p>
<p>"At that time, the barbarian chief Lu Lu rebelled in Si Prefecture, and his younger brother, Lu Xian, and Chao Xiu surrendered. Emperor Gaozu appointed Lu Lusheng as the governor of Northern Si Prefecture, Lu Xian as the governor of Northern Yu Prefecture, and Chao Xiu as the governor of Ding Prefecture, to defend the northern border. However, Lu Sheng and Chao Xiu slandered each other and had thoughts of leaving. Xiao Xiu soothed and accepted them, making use of their talents, and often relied on them." The *History of Wei* 9, Xiaoming Emperor's chronicle, has this entry for the fourth year of the Yanchang era (the fourteenth year of the Tianjian era, 515):</p>
<p>"In the eighth month… on the day of Gengchen, Xiao Yan's governor of Ding Prefecture, Chao Xiu, led three thousand followers to surrender."</p>
<p>This is what the *Book of Liang* refers to as "thoughts of leaving." The surrender of the Tian brothers, Lu Sheng and Lu Xian, and their appointment as governors of the three prefectures, was twelve or thirteen years before Li Daoyuan's death.</p>
<p>Li Daoyuan's most leisurely period seems to have been the time between when he was dismissed from his position as the governor of Eastern Jingzhou and returned to the capital and when he became the prefect of Henan. He served as the governor of Eastern Jingzhou in the fourth year of the Yanchang era (515); according to the biography of Zhao Su in the *Book of the Northern Zhou*, he became the prefect of Henan in the fifth year of the Zhengguang era (524). The *Shui Jing Zhu* does not contain any historical events after the beginning of the Zhengguang era. Perhaps this great book was written in a fit of passion after his dismissal and before his reappointment. (Revised draft on the nights of 3/7/3/8/3/9)</p>
<h3>Xin Jiaxuan's Demotion and Reinstatement in His Later Years</h3>
<p>— Deng Guangming</p>
<p>—Supplement to the Chronological Biography of Jiaxuan—</p>
<p>The fourth year of the Jiatai era of Emperor Ningzong of Song (1204 AD) was precisely the era when Han Tuozhou was in power. In order to consolidate his power in the court, Han Tuozhou was eager to launch a war against foreign powers, hoping to establish a great achievement. At this time, the Southern Song Dynasty had been established in Jiangzuo for more than seventy years, and its military strength had always been insufficient to resist foreign tribes. When Emperor Xiaozong first ascended the throne, he had intended to restore the lost territories, but after Zhang Jun, Li Xianzong, and others were defeated by the Jin army at Fuliji in the first year of the Longxing era (1163), the entire country dared not propose the use of force against the Jin again. From then on, morale declined daily, and social customs became increasingly decadent. From the Longxing era of Emperor Xiaozong to the Jiatai era of Emperor Ningzong, procrastination and inertia had lasted for more than thirty years. People of ambition and determination who were eager to restore the lost territories were under this low-pressure atmosphere for a long time, and they could not bear their impatience and frustration. They desperately hoped that those in control of military and political power would come forward to change the situation. Since they knew that Han Tuozhou was eager to try, they were mostly willing to cooperate with him, rush to achieve success, so that national hatred could be slightly vented, and personal depression and feelings could be slightly expressed. At that time, public and private records (such as the Qingyuan Party Ban and the *Records of the Court and the Public Since the Jianyan Era*) all record that Jiaxuan entered the palace in the fourth year of the Jiatai era to meet Emperor Ningzong, presenting the benefits of using force, and also said that the Jin state would surely be in chaos and perish. He wished to entrust this matter to veteran ministers and strive to have a plan that could respond to sudden changes. Jiaxuan's active advocacy for the use of force against the Jin must have been out of the aforementioned state of mind.</p>
<p>Jiaxuan's proposal, because it was put forward at an appropriate time, had a great effect. According to historical records, Han Tuozhou was overjoyed and decided to challenge the Jin with force.</p>
<p>Before entering the palace to meet the emperor, Jiaxuan was serving as the prefect of Shaoxing and concurrently as the Pacification Commissioner of Zhejiang East Road. Shortly after the audience, he was changed to the prefect of Zhenjiang, and the purpose of this change was probably, as Liu Zhi said in his congratulatory letter to Jiaxuan, "Considering Jingkou, it is truly a border town."</p>
<p>Before taking office in Zhenjiang, Jiaxuan's official rank had just been promoted from Grand Master of the Court of Imperial Sacrifices to Grand Master of the Court of Imperial Counsel. His additional post had also just been promoted from Compiler of the Jiying Hall to Attendant-in-Waiting of the Binge Pavilion. Jiaxuan was already sixty-five years old that year.</p>
<p>In the third month of the fourth year of the Jiatai era, Jiaxuan went to Zhenjiang to take office. After a full year, in the third month of the first year of the Kaixi era (1205), because of an incident of recommending the wrong person, Jiaxuan was "demoted for mistakenly recommending" and lost two ranks, from Grand Master of the Court of Imperial Counsel to Grand Master of the Court for Leisure. (According to the Song system: below Grand Master of the Court of Imperial Counsel was Grand Master of the Court of Imperial Sacrifices, and below Grand Master of the Court of Imperial Sacrifices was Grand Master of the Court for Leisure).</p>
<p>The record of this matter in the biography of Jiaxuan in the *History of the Song Dynasty* is very brief, with only the eight characters "demoted to Grand Master of the Court for Leisure for mistakenly recommending," which does not allow us to know exactly what happened. In the eleventh record of Dismissals and Demotions in the *Song Huiyao* compiled by Xu Song, it is compared and said:</p>
<p>"[In the first year of the Kaixi era] On the second day of the third month, Xin Qiji, Attendant-in-Waiting of the Longtu Pavilion and prefect of Zhenjiang, was demoted by two ranks because Zhang Jing, a Secretarial Drafter, was illegal, and Qiji was responsible for mistakenly recommending him." Although the record here is slightly more detailed, the exact nature of Zhang Jing's illegal actions, which caused such an important figure as Jiaxuan, who was heavily relied upon by the court at the time, to be punished, remains unknown. What we particularly want to know is whether Jiaxuan was reinstated to his original rank after this demotion of two ranks. This question cannot be answered in the *History of the Song Dynasty*, the *Song Huiyao*, or in any of the miscellaneous histories and notes of the Song people. Therefore, when I wrote the "Chronological Biography of Xin Jiaxuan" (although this book was recently published by the Commercial Press, it is an old work of mine from ten years ago), I did not provide an answer to this question. Recently, after reading Cai Youxue's (Xingzhi) *Collected Works of the Yudetang Outer Edicts*, I finally found the answer to this question and learned that Jiaxuan was later reinstated as Grand Master of the Court of Imperial Counsel, and all of the edicts before and after were written by Cai Youxue.</p>
<p>I will now transcribe the two edicts related to Jiaxuan's reinstatement and roughly estimate their dates.</p>
<p>1. Edict reinstating Xin Qiji as Grand Master of the Court of Imperial Sacrifices: "Recommending the virtuous and capable is the ambition of scholars; being held jointly liable for mistaken recommendations is an old law of the state. Although the law must be enforced, the circumstances may be understood. Official so-and-so has long been known for his outstanding qualities and has aspired to achieve fame. He was entrusted with important tasks during his tenure and was widely praised in several circuits. Having served for a long time, he has seen many people. How could his judgment have been so imprecise that he implicated himself in his recommendations? Therefore, he is granted amnesty and gradually restored to his previous official position. Knowing a person's benevolence through his mistakes, how can We continue to blame the past? Only by promoting the good will you be able to learn from the past. You must be more careful in the future." (Collected Works of the Yudetang Outer Edicts, Volume 1, leaf 2).</p>
<p>This edict is placed after the edict "Wu Zong Dismissed from Academician Expositor of the Longtu Pavilion" and before the edict "Cheng Song Settled in Lizhou". Wu Zong was dismissed from the Academician Expositorship of the Longtu Pavilion because of Wu Xi's rebellion. The *Song Huiyao* (6) under Penal Law records:</p>
<p>"[In the third year of the Kaixi era, third month] Twenty-seventh day, the Sichuan Capital Grand Tea and Horse Official Wu Zong said: 'The rebel Wu Xi did not fulfill his duties as a subject, betrayed the kindness of the country above, and betrayed his family below. I am related to his family and deserve to be punished ten thousand times. I respectfully await punishment at the palace gate with my son Zhao and others.' An edict ordered Wu Zong to be dismissed and released."</p>
<p>Cai's edict has phrases such as "Attaching to the execution of the great villain, pouring out sincerity and confessing guilt", which is aimed at Wu Zong's memorial requesting punishment. It can be seen that this edict was issued on the twenty-seventh day of the third month. According to the *History of the Song Dynasty* - Emperor Ningzong's Annals, Cheng Song was ordered to be the vice military commissioner of Shun Chang and settled in Lizhou on the Renyin day of the third month of the Kaixi era, The first day of the third month of this year was Bingzi, and Renyin was exactly the twenty-seventh day. Since Jiaxuan's edict reinstating Grand Master of the Court of Imperial Sacrifices is located between the two, it can be known that it and the above two events must have been on the same day.</p>
<p>2. Edict reinstating Xin Qiji as Grand Master of the Court of Imperial Counsel: "We hope that the ministers in attendance will promote talents and work together to achieve great things. However, it is difficult to know a person, and there may be cases of mistaken recommendations, but their intentions can be discerned. Official so-and-so is highly talented and has been famous for generations. He was recently removed from his position of deliberation and is still under careful consideration. Due to a minor mistake, he has not yet been restored to his previous rank. However, We will not withhold the usual review. Strive to repay the country, and strive to promote the virtuous. Do not be discouraged by the punishment of one person, and do not hinder your ambition to promote talents. This is what We expect of you, please remember it." (Collected Works of the Yudetang Outer Edicts, Volume 1, leaf 12).</p>
<p>This edict is placed after the edict of "Zhao Chun appointed as the Jianghuai Pacification Commissioner" and before the edict of "Xiang Anshi removed from the post of Academician of the Longtu Pavilion". Now, according to the *History of the Song Dynasty* - Emperor Ningzong's Annals, Zhao Chun was appointed as the Deputy Commander of the Palace Guards and concurrently as the Jianghuai Pacification Commissioner on the Xinmao day of the ninth month of the third year of the Kaixi era; and according to the *Song Huiyao* (11) under Dismissals and Demotions of Officials, Xiang Anshi's removal from the post of Academician of the Longtu Pavilion was on the twenty-second day of the seventh month of this year. These two records in the *History of the Song Dynasty* and the *Song Huiyao* are clear and unambiguous, so I believe that the arrangement of these edicts in the *Collected Works of the Yudetang Outer Edicts* must have some inversions and omissions. Now, I will tentatively determine the date of Jiaxuan's reinstatement as Grand Master of the Court of Imperial Counsel based on the date of Xiang Anshi's removal from office, so the latest it should be is the twenty-second day of the seventh month. In the eighth month of this year, Jiaxuan had already fallen ill at home, and he passed away on the tenth day of the ninth month. We have no way of knowing whether he ever saw this edict while lying on his sickbed.</p>
<p>Although Jiaxuan was demoted by two ranks due to Zhang Jing's illegal actions, he continued to serve as the prefect of Zhenjiang and was not dismissed. His additional post was still Attendant-in-Waiting. On the nineteenth day of the sixth month of the first year of the Kaixi era, he was reassigned as the prefect of Longxing, but before he took office, he was impeached by an official and removed from his new post, changed to "Promoter of the Chongyou Taoist Temple," and returned to live in Qianshan in the autumn.</p>
<p>In the *History of the Song Dynasty* - Jiaxuan's Biography, after "Promoter of the Chongyou Taoist Temple," it continues, "Appointed as the prefect of Shaoxing, Pacification Commissioner of Zhejiang East Road, he declined the appointment. Promoted to Attendant-in-Waiting of the Huawen Pavilion, then promoted to Attendant-in-Waiting of the Longtu Pavilion. Appointed as the prefect of Jiangzhou, ordered to go to the imperial court for an interview, tried as Vice Minister of the Ministry of War, he declined the appointment." Although Jiaxuan did not take office in any of these appointments, it can be seen that the imperial court still relied heavily on him, so his official titles were gradually promoted to Attendant-in-Waiting of the Longtu Pavilion. However, even as they relied on him so heavily, they delayed in reinstating his demoted ranks. Was this because Zhang Jing's illegal actions were too serious, or was it because Song dynasty scholars only "regarded ascending to the cabinet and being promoted to the imperial guard as high-ranking officials, and did not regard the speed of promotion as honor or stagnation," and people in the court held this view, so they thought that Jiaxuan's reinstatement was insignificant and caused such a long delay? We have no way of answering this question either.</p>
<p>In the *Collected Works of the Yudetang Outer Edicts*, there is also an edict for "Jiaxuan Xin, Attendant-in-Waiting, to retire," which is even later. I will also transcribe it here:</p>
<p>"The edict granting the return of the ring is precisely for the need of talents; admiring the honor of the chariot, it is heard that he has resigned. Strive to follow your sincerity, and grant you special honors. Official so-and-so has keen insight and decisive action, and has long been known for his extraordinary talents; he has experienced hardships and has become more determined in his ambitions in his later years. He served Our ancestors with loyalty, and during Our reign, We entrusted him with important tasks and appointed him to high positions. Considering that his rest was not long ago, We still have great regard for him. We want him to be familiar with the border plans and enter the inner circle to receive confidential orders. How could he suddenly fall ill and request to resign? Therefore, We grant him the old rank and increase his new rank, to honor him and to give him rest. Without competition, We cherish the old minister; without medicine, We have joy, may he have longevity." (Volume 3, leaf 10.)</p>
<p>This edict is placed after the edict of "Zhao Shanxuan appointed as the prefect of Lin'an" and before the edict of "Zhao Shiheng appointed as the prefect of Zhenjiang". According to the *Chunxi Lin'an Zhi* - Rank of Officials, Zhao Shanxuan was appointed as the acting prefect of Lin'an with the title of Compiler of the Huawen Pavilion and the rank of Grand Master of the Court of Imperial Sacrifices and Assistant Minister of the Ministry of Works on the twenty-sixth day of the twelfth month of the third year of the Kaixi era; according to the *Jiading Zhenjiang Zhi* - Song Dynasty Prefects, Zhao Shiheng took office on the fifth day of the first month of the first year of the Jiading era (1208). Jiaxuan's retirement is located between the two, so it is known that the event was either at the end of the third year of the Kaixi era or at the beginning of the first year of the Jiading era, when Jiaxuan had passed away for more than one hundred days. It is likely that Jiaxuan had submitted a memorial requesting retirement when he was seriously ill, and by the time the memorial reached the court, he may have already passed away. After a long process of "official document travel" in between, it was inevitably delayed for three or four months.</p>

<h3>On the Translation of the Southern Transmission Tripitaka</h3>
<p>— Ji Xianlin</p>
<p>A few days ago, a friend sent me from Shanghai six volumes of the Southern Transmission Tripitaka, printed by the Universal Buddhist Tripitaka Publication Society. Two of them are the Long Discourses, originally named Dighanikaya, equivalent to the Dirghagama in the Chinese Tripitaka. The translator, Jiang Baibo, translated it based on a Japanese translation. One volume is the Middle Length Discourses, originally named Majjhimaikaya, equivalent to the Madhyamagama in the Chinese Tripitaka. The translator, Shramana Zhifeng, also translated it based on a Japanese translation. Two volumes are the Jataka tales from the Minor Collection (Khuddakanikaya). The translator, Xia Gaizun, also translated it based on a Japanese translation. The last volume is the Conditional Relations (Patthanapakarana or Mfahapakrana) of the Abhidhamma Pitaka (Book of Analysis), the topic is similar to the Northern Transmission's Jñānaprasthāna (Taishō Tripiṭaka No. 1544); however, the content and form are different. The translator, Fan Jidong, still translated it based on a Japanese translation. It is said that the original plan of the Universal Buddhist Tripitaka Publication Society was to translate the entire Southern Transmission Tripitaka from Japanese translations. However, due to various reasons, this great plan has only realized a very small portion to date: it seems that only these six volumes have been printed. Although not many books have been published, this plan is very meaningful, and the courage alone is worthy of our admiration. In addition to admiration for the publication of this book, I also have some opinions, which I will now write down in a rambling manner.</p>
<p>Let's first talk about the term "Southern Transmission". "Southern" is in contrast to "Northern". "Northern" refers to the Sanskrit or mixed-text Tripitaka. "Southern" refers to the Pali Tripitaka. Not only do Chinese scholars divide it this way, but foreign scholars do as well. The current Pali Tripitaka is indeed prevalent in Sri Lanka in the South, and the Tripitaka written in Siamese script also spread from Sri Lanka. It seems that we have no reason to deny the correctness of the term "Southern Transmission". However, if we return to history and study the distribution of the Pali Tripitaka, we will immediately feel that the term "Southern Transmission" is problematic. First of all, Pali is not a southern dialect. The origin of Pali is very complex, and we still dare not say that we have solved all the linguistic problems related to Pali. But in general, we can say that Pali is a western dialect, because many grammatical features are similar to the (Girnar) dialect in the Edicts of Ashoka. Scholars researching from the perspective of the inscriptions can also prove that the old home of Pali is in the central to western part of the Vindhya Mountains. Although there are many traces of eastern dialects in it, these are all preserved from the original Magadhi scriptures. How could such a western dialect scripture flow to Sri Lanka in the South? We have no historical materials to explain this matter, so we have to resort to legends. According to legend, Ashoka's younger brother or son, Mahinda, brought this Pali Tripitaka to Sri Lanka, and flew there from the air. We certainly cannot believe such legends; however, this legend may suggest a historical fact: that this scripture was brought to Sri Lanka by eminent monks who went south to preach during the reign of the Buddhist Dharma King Ashoka. Regardless of how the scripture was transmitted, its original home was definitely not in the South. Therefore, I feel that the term "Southern Transmission" is not very appropriate, and we should change it, or simply call it the Pali Tripitaka.</p>
<p>Now let's talk about the issue of translation. These volumes that have already been printed are all re-translated from Japanese translations. I have always opposed re-translation, because I feel that translation is already a last resort. No matter what language is translated into what language, no matter how high the translator's skills are, the style, charm, and even the meaning of the original text cannot be completely preserved in the translation, let alone re-translation? There are many very famous translations in the world, such as Fitzgeralcl's translation of the Rubaiyat, and Shlegl and Tieck's German translations of Shakespeare; however, if you study them carefully, these translations are famous entirely because of the exquisiteness of the translation, not because the translation captures the charm and style of the original text. These translations are actually creations, and the original text only provides the inspiration for creation. I also dare not approve of re-translating the Pali Tripitaka from Japanese. Japanese and Pali are very different in sentence structure. Even English, German, and French, which belong to the same language family as Pali, cannot faithfully retain the style and sentence structure of the original text, let alone Japanese? Now let's just give one example: Jataka No. 38, originally named Baka-Jataka (Heron Jataka), contains a poem. I will now write the original text below:</p>
<p>Naccanta nikatippannonikatya sukham edhati</p>
<p>Aradhe nikatippanno bako kakkata-m-iva'ti</p>
<p>The direct translation is:</p>
<p>One skilled in deceit cannot always benefit from deceit,</p>
<p>Just like the deceitful heron received from the crab.</p>
<p>The meaning is that although a person skilled in deceit can sometimes benefit from deceit, there will always be retribution one day. The deceitful heron being punished by the crab is an example. The original text has two lines, each with sixteen syllables. Each line can be divided into two halves (Pada), each Pada with eight syllables. There is a bit of a grammatical problem in the second line, and it seems that it needs to be supplemented to be clear.</p>
<p>Let's look at the translation now. I don't have the Japanese translation at hand, so I can only look at the Chinese translation translated from the Japanese translation:</p>
<p>One skilled in deceit, because of deceit</p>
<p>Cannot permanently plan, like deceit to receive ( ).</p>
<p>Each line is divided into two sections, probably to represent the Pada of the original text. However, it failed, because the first and second Pada of the original text have become three sections here, and the last two Pada have been reduced to one section. Furthermore, in terms of meaning, there also seems to be a mistake: the translator seems to be saying that it is because of deceit that one cannot prosper permanently, which does not match the meaning of the original text. Let's look at the English translation:</p>
<p>Guile profits not you very guileful folk</p>
<p>Mark what the guilefulcrane got from the crabf 1</p>
<p>This translation is too free, adding several words for no reason that are not in the original text, and the tone is completely different from the original text. Compared with the English translation and the Japanese translation, I think the Japanese translation is more faithful to the original text. If someone translates the Jataka from the English translation, I am afraid it will be even further from the original text.</p>
<p>I said above that the second line seems to have some problems. There are many places like this with problems in the Pali Tripitaka, mostly because the transmission time has been too long, and there are bound to be errors in transcription. Take the Jataka for example, there are many problems inside. The edition collated and printed by Fausboll is recognized as a masterpiece; however, it still leaves many difficult problems unresolved. The English version evaluated by the famous British Sanskrit scholar Cuwell and a large group of Sanskrit scholars, and the text version translated by Dutrroit, cannot fully satisfy us, and some places are often far-fetched. Therefore, whoever wants to translate the Pali scriptures must conduct precise research on the original text, and his translation will represent his attainments in Pali research. When translating, in addition to the most common publication of the Pali Text Society, one should also consult the Tripitaka in Siamese script, because the Tripitaka in Siamese script is sometimes better than the commonly published edition, and the wording is closer to the ancient version in some places. Although Japanese scholars already know how to use the Tripitaka in Siamese script, Japanese scholars' research achievements in Pali are not particularly outstanding. Using not-so-outstanding achievements to do such a difficult work, some places are inevitably far-fetched, which is also expected. Therefore, I believe that many difficulties in wording in the Pali Tripitaka may not all be satisfactorily resolved in the Japanese translation. Now we actually want to re-translate such a book in its entirety, isn't it a bit of a thankless task? We don't have many experts working in this area right now, so of course we can't talk about being able to directly translate the entire Tripitaka from Pali; however, we might as well start with small things, as many people as we have, translate as much as we can, and slowly add to it. Many years later, maybe we can directly translate the entire Pali Tripitaka. Even if we can only translate one volume right now, that one volume can also represent our true ability, which is always better than re-translating a foreign language translation. Perhaps some people will say: if we do this, we don't know how long we will have to wait to see the translation of the entire Pali Tripitaka. But what does that matter? I still believe to this day that one should adhere to the spirit of "rather have quality over quantity" when doing scholarship.</p>
<p>I have said a lot above, and it seems that I am not satisfied with the Pali Tripitaka printed by the Universal Wisdom Tripitaka Publication Society. Actually, it's not like that, I very much admire this spirit. I only hope that Chinese scholars can go further, so I said a lot. My intention is to give encouragement to scholars, so that they do not waste their energy, that's all. (Evening of March 4th, at Peking University)</p>

<h3>Talking About Illusions</h3>
<p>— Shi Yu</p>
<p>If you put your index finger on your forehead and then shake your head with your eyes closed, you will feel that it is your finger that is moving. If you look at a straight stick as bent through a refractive glass, when you touch it with your hand, you will also feel that it is bent. If you are sitting in the express train of the Beijing-Shanghai Railway, if you close your eyes and sit facing away from the direction the train is traveling, you will feel that the train is moving in the opposite direction. A truly perfect square does not look very square, and if the width is slightly wider, it will look more like a square. Two straight lines of equal length look longer when placed vertically than when placed horizontally.</p>
<p>A dog barks wildly at its own reflection in the water; a sparrow flies high when it sees a scarecrow in the field. Humans are also like this, we live in illusions. The earth is constantly rotating, but we never feel it; the river flows, the scenery moves but the boat does not, that is the same principle. A color-blind person can see a red flower as blue. A sensitive person can see the white clouds in the sky as a grey dog. When the old Russian Empress Catherine was touring Siberia, local officials used paper houses to decorate the roadside. The Empress rejoiced, saying: "Is Siberia so beautiful?" The Empress lived in an illusion.</p>
<p>I don't know where the saying comes from that peanuts and dried tofu taste like ham when eaten together. But psychologists have indeed told us that the sense of taste is the easiest to cause illusions. If you pinch your nostrils and close your eyes, then margarine and butter taste the same, and you can't even tell the difference between chicken, beef, and pork. You can't even tell the difference between tomato soup and onion soup.</p>
<p>Merchants are the most adept at using illusions. If you stroll on Jing'an Temple Road, try to pay attention to the prices marked in the windows on both sides, and you will rarely see whole numbers. The owner of a shoe store will mark a pair of leather shoes at "$87,975,000" instead of directly marking "$2,000,000". Because of the customer's illusion, they feel that nine dimes and nine cents is cheaper than one dollar by less than one cent. Whole numbers are enough to create a "hurdle" feeling. When the price of rice rises from 2.5 million to 2.9 million, it is not very exciting, but when it rises to 3.01 million, we jump up: "We broke the 3 million mark--"</p>
<p>Psychologists tell us that our daily observations are almost always wrong. A piece of paper looks square from the front; from the side it looks like a line. We often only see one side of things when we observe general things, and ignore the other aspects. There is a famous story of a blind man touching an elephant: it says that when the blind man touched the back of the elephant, he thought the elephant was a wall; when he touched the elephant's nose, he thought it was a snake; when he touched the elephant's leg, he thought the elephant was a pillar. Abstract things are the easiest to cause illusions. A child asked his father:</p>
<p>"What is air?"</p>
<p>"Air is something that is invisible, odorless, and tasteless."</p>
<p>"How is it colorless, odorless, and tasteless?"</p>
<p>"It's as colorless as glass, as odorless and tasteless as plain boiled water!"</p>
<p>"I see! Air is like a glass cup!"</p>
<p>Errors in observation can be partly attributed to "emotion". People say: "You are too emotional!" Human nature always overestimates what it likes and underestimates what it dislikes. Daiyu's tuberculosis is seen as a kind of beauty by Baoyu, and the intelligence of yellow people is seen as a waste by white people. You feel that this thing is right because the person you admire or respect feels that the thing is right. When George Bernard Shaw felt that the death penalty should not be abolished, many British people also felt that the death penalty should not be abolished. If ancient rulers wanted to eat phoenix livers, they would just eat them; if modern rulers want to eat phoenix stomachs, they must first create a set of public opinions to make people have the mistaken idea that "rulers must eat phoenix livers", and then eat them out of necessity, just like a gambler who can deal himself the last ace while keeping people in the dark.</p>
<p>Prejudice and superstition are a kind of illusion, or at least a partial illusion. Astrologers bless your future because you are born with phoenix eyes and broad forehead, and a full tip of the nose. But if you are born with a catfish mouth, bat ears, or uneven face, or a face with five peaks that are not full, then your future will be full of twists and turns. It is said that seeing someone's funeral is unlucky. Dreaming of a coffin, holding an umbrella in the house, seeing the water receding, the sun setting, or the last half moon, are all unlucky. When a bird flies away from the church during a wedding, it is a bad omen; when a dog cries with its head down when someone is sick, misfortune is coming. Psychologists have studied this kind of prejudice and superstition and found that it is completely a human illusion. This kind of faulty logic is often formed because of the accidental association of certain things. We feel that thirteen is an unlucky number because Christ's last supper was with thirteen people, and Christ was crucified on the cross. Emperor Taizu of Ming had a pointed chin, so people said that pointed chins have the appearance of emperors. A long time ago, a patient happened to die when an owl was hooting sadly, so people said that an owl hooting when someone is sick is an unlucky omen. These are coincidences that create human illusions. Emerson said: "Superstition is born of ignorance." If we live in illusion, we also live in ignorance!</p>
<h3>Breakfast</h3>
<p>— Yu Wen</p>
<p>I came to Shanghai in 1938 and lived in a small room attached to a studio in a large building. Because I had to go out to teach in the morning and rush back to do my own work in the afternoon, the most important thing to do in the morning was to eat. At that time, the most ideal breakfast was ten scallion oil crab shell pastries for one dime or hot steamed meat buns, which were cheap and delicious, and incomparable. After eating, I couldn't help but feel satisfied and greatly interested in life.</p>
<p>A few days ago, I passed by a rarely walked stone street because of something, and saw freshly baked crab shell pastries on a pancake stall. I suddenly felt hungry, so I asked the price. The stall owner raised five fingers and said, "Five thousand each". I had to buy two within my means and ate them as I walked. Although the flavor of this pastry has not diminished compared to those days, I always feel that what comes through the layer of crisp fragrance is a kind of bitter, deep-seated taste. As for the feeling of being "greatly interested in life" when eating the most basic breakfast ten years ago, it is no longer possible to grasp.</p>
<p>I don't remember the exact date when my breakfast started to say goodbye to me. To put it vaguely, it was probably when I was working as a daily newspaper editor. Since then, I have never been able to appreciate the little beauty in the little poverty of the "lodger" period in the studio.</p>
<h3>On Jumping Off Buildings</h3>
<p>— He Ku</p>
<p>There are many traditional Chinese methods of suicide, such as slitting one's throat, hanging oneself, jumping into a well, and jumping off a building. Jumping off a building is the most tragic suicide method. This kind of tragic death involves brains splattered and flesh blurred. "It is difficult throughout the ages to die only once", jumping off a building to die is the most difficult of the difficult. There was a woman in Chinese history who was famous for falling from a building, she was Green Pearl, the concubine of Shi Chong of Jin Dynasty. Green Pearl's beauty aroused Sun Xiu's covetousness, and he did not hesitate to falsely create an imperial edict from the old emperor to imprison Chong in order to seize the beauty. As a result, Green Pearl was unwilling to succumb to violence and committed suicide by jumping off the building.</p>
<p>There are many people who commit suicide due to political failure. After the collapse of the Nazi regime, Hitler's whereabouts are still a mystery. Rumors say that he took poison and then destroyed the body to eliminate traces. Since there is no factual evidence, it has become a mystery, so let's leave it aside. Göring committed suicide by taking potassium cyanide on the eve of being sentenced to hanging, which can be regarded as the most cowardly suicide, which is too far removed from his style when he was a powerful figure. The Japanese former Prime Minister Tojo's suicide with a pistol was just a pose, close to a woman's disheveled hair and weeping, shouting and scolding in the street, used as a basis for shamelessness when the Far East Court interrogated him today. As for those who use jumping off a building to commit suicide as a way to retire bravely due to political disagreements, of course we have to refer to the reported suicide of the Czechoslovak Foreign Minister Masaryk the day before yesterday. The Reuters telegram reported from London, of course, greatly praised Masaryk, "Democratic people here believe that Masaryk's death is tantamount to making the final protest against the Czech coup d'état twenty-one days ago." My personal view is to abandon the complex political factors and praise his decisive and heroic act on the eve of his death, which is worthy of unanimous praise by the world. Masaryk's political views were contrary to those of the Czech government after the coup. In order to avoid inner pain, he was willing to sacrifice his life for the cause. This act is close to the Buddhist spirit of "sacrificing oneself to feed a hungry tiger"; of course, I say it is "close to" this spirit, and it is not really completely in line with sacrificing oneself to feed a tiger.</p>
<p>Chinese people have always followed the Confucian doctrine of the golden mean on the issue of different political views: "If the Way is not practiced, take a raft and float on the sea." What is meant is to disappear into the mountains and forests. This is a path from engaging in the world to leaving the world. Westerners are willing to sacrifice themselves, and sacrificing oneself to the point of falling from a building is to return to the world from engaging in the world. Why is that? He is unwilling to succumb to the new environment, and in his soul he only adheres to the old traditions. Since he cannot resist the trend, he only has the path of "embracing the bright moon and ending his life", concealing himself in the invisible for the sake of his faith, so he is still engaged in the world.</p>
<p>This tragic method of death may not be enough to encourage the decadent customs, but what can be explained is that Masaryk sacrificed himself for his freedom of thought and freedom of belief.</p>
<h3>A Warning</h3>
<p>— Ran Ran</p>
<p>The situation these days, we seem to be watching a movie.</p>
<p>The first shot is a large $ sign, followed by a loud noise on the screen, and the $ sign is broken into many pieces. After a while, it is put together again to form a whole, but it is much smaller than the original $ sign. My metaphor is very superficial, but everyone must know its meaning, because in fact, it can be said that we are both the audience and the protagonist. Except for a few lucky ones, the situation of ordinary people, especially salaried workers, is very embarrassing. The banknotes in our pockets or the monthly income have been reduced by 30%, 40%...for no reason.</p>
<p>Leaving aside the economic losses, I think the psychological impact must be great, and it is enough to affect the working mood of ordinary people. May I ask someone across the street, two or three days ago, bought five boxes of solid soap, each box costing more than four million yuan, and now it has risen to more than four million six hundred thousand yuan per box. In one turn of the hand, without spending half a bit of brainpower or spending a cent of physical strength, he enjoys a profit of more than two million yuan. On the other hand, someone is working a small job in a certain organization, working hard all day long, and the average daily income is only 200,000 to 300,000 yuan. Under such circumstances, wouldn't it make those who are burying their heads in work "discouraged" and flock to the path of "hoarders"! If you can't buy whole boxes or whole packages, then just buy a few pieces of soap and a few boxes of matches. As a result, perhaps before an "economic crisis" occurs, the paralysis of people's hearts is enough to destroy the mood for construction.</p>
<p>In fact, it depends on people. The situation of inflation in the United States is also very bad. But they have their own coping methods.</p>
<p>The first is to withdraw funds from circulation, and banks restrict loans. There is no way to transfer funds to buy goods, and prices are bound to be unable to rise. The question is how to use the surplus deposits after banks restrict loans, which requires careful consideration.</p>
<p>The second is that the supply of goods is not easy to increase in the short term, so we can only start with controlling the market and buying households.</p>
<p>The above is a lesson from other countries, or it can be used to attack the current "mistakes".</p>
<h3>Frozen Cake</h3>
<p>— Mao Yi</p>
<p>Ever since Gordon Merl entered the pastry industry at the age of twenty-two, he has been dreaming of opening a pastry shop without ovens. Today, he is the owner of the most unusual pastry shop in the United States, his products are not baked, but frozen!</p>
<p>There are two hundred stores across the United States that sell the frozen steamed buns, cakes, rolls, and pastries he makes. Customers only need to bake them in the oven when they buy them home.</p>
<p>This new method of making pastries solves the problem of how modern housewives can bake themselves with the least amount of trouble. A "frozen cake" can be kept in a household refrigerator for several days without the risk of losing its flavor, becoming hard, or spoiling.</p>
<p>Merl is confident that he runs the world's first and only pastry shop without ovens. This shop is located in Oak Park Village, west of Chicago. The village has a population of nearly 70,000 and is the largest village in the United States.</p>
<p>Merl's frozen cakes are now selling well all over the United States. These pastries are all made by specialized chefs, placed in cardboard boxes, in portions suitable for household use, and frozen in refrigerators at minus ten degrees. Like transporting ice cream, they are transported in refrigerator trucks to the refrigerators of retailers, and then sold to customers.</p>
<p>One of the main reasons why cakes are popular with housewives is their freshness. Pastries sold in general stores have been out of the oven for at least several hours, and some have been out of the oven for a day or two. If you buy a frozen cake and bake it in the oven, it will be the same as a fresh one. Another advantage is saving energy and time. Housewives don't need to mix flour, add seasonings, or ferment, they only need to bake it. After the frozen bread rolls are baked, their volume can double, and the fermentation performance is not damaged by freezing at all.</p>
<p>Merl hated getting up to work at 3:30 every morning and standing in front of a hot oven for long periods of time, regardless of winter or summer, so he thought of making frozen cakes, and his creation has indeed made it easier for many housewives.</p>
<h3>Poetry Records of Haihong Building</h3>
<p>— Xu Banmeng</p>
<p>Untitled</p>
<p>Coming is yearning, going is sorrow, riding a crane to Yangzhou in light clothes, red cotton fine frames lock spring, green powder secluded branches hook butterflies at noon, in vain I am sad and throw away the brocade zither, I push him to repeatedly kick the fragrant swing, the fairy spring has no news after all, surpassing the twelve buildings of Jiangnan.</p>
<p>Clouds stretch across the northern border, rain falls in the south, phoenixes fly together, pulling at parting thoughts, I can offer red butter to tease the jade rabbit, I am ashamed that I have no white dregs to pour for the golden cicada, the deep love that crosses the sea is hard to fill, the tears that have dried up in the Xiang River cannot be expressed, when I suddenly meet an envoy from Qingdao, I earnestly persuade him to pluck the seven strings.</p>
<p>Parting Thoughts</p>
<p>Morning makeup opens by the tulip hall, disorderly and numerous flowers are planted in order, the Chang'e who enters the moon falsely occupies the round palace, carrying the rain the goddess mistakenly ascends the Yangtai; I hate the leaf-healing hibiscus mirror, I hug the fragrant cardamom bud in death, I do not believe that there is parting in the world, I invite you to drink a cup together on horseback.</p>

<h3>Lincoln's Beard</h3>
<p>— Lei Ying</p>
<p>Of all the portraits or photographs we see of Lincoln, none are without a beard encircling his cheeks. Coupled with his voluminous hair, gaunt face, and kind yet slightly melancholic gaze, the overall impression he gives us is a blend of solemnity and approachability.</p>
<p>However, when he was nominated as the Republican candidate for president in 1860, his chin was still a barren expanse of bare skin.</p>
<p>What prompted him to grow a beard was an eleven-year-old girl.</p>
<p>At that time, the news of Lincoln's nomination reached New York. The New York publisher, Hus, immediately sent a painter named Shes to visit Lincoln in Illinois to paint a half-length, side-view portrait of him. This was the first portrait of Lincoln's life, showing him wearing a dark black formal suit, set against a blue-gray background, his expression solemn and pensive – but his chin was bare, lacking any flourish.</p>
<p>This portrait was reproduced and distributed for Lincoln's campaign. That year's election was extremely heated, with even children dividing into parties and enthusiastically discussing the merits of the candidates. In Westfield, New York, an eleven-year-old girl named Grace Bedell supported Lincoln for president, but after carefully studying Lincoln's portrait, she suddenly noticed Lincoln's flaw...</p>
<p>That autumn, Lincoln was busy with his campaign, receiving countless letters every day. Suddenly, one letter caught his attention. The letter contained many grammatical errors, and even slightly misspelled Lincoln's name, but the content was filled with earnest concern. The letter said:</p>
<p>"Mr. Lincoln: My father just came home from the market and brought back your portrait. I am an eleven-year-old girl, but I really hope you can be the President of the United States, so I am writing to you now, hoping you won't mind? I don't know if you have a daughter the same age as me, if you do, please send my regards to her on my behalf. If you don't have time to write back to me, please have her do it for you. I have four brothers, some of whom want to vote for you, but if you would grow a little beard, then I will definitely persuade them to vote for you unanimously. Your face is very thin, growing a beard would definitely make you look better than you do now. Women all like men with beards, and if you grow a beard, they will definitely pressure their husbands to vote for you. My father will definitely vote for you, and if I were a man, I would definitely vote for you..."</p>
<p>The letter was signed "Grace Bedell".</p>
<p>In reality, fashionable people at that time did not wear beards, but the concern in this letter deeply moved Lincoln. Three days later, Lincoln wrote a reply to Grace:</p>
<p>"Dear little girl: Your lovely letter has been received. Unfortunately, I don't have a daughter. I have three sons – one seventeen, one nine, and one seven. Including me and their mother, that's my whole family. As for the beard, I have never grown one before. If I were to grow one now, do you think people would say I'm being pretentious?"</p>
<p>However, Lincoln actually grew a beard. By the time he traveled from his hometown in Illinois to Washington to take office as president the following year, his beard was already quite impressive.</p>
<p>Lincoln did not forget the little girl. When his special train passed through Westfield, New York, the train station was as usual, crowded with people welcoming him. Grace arrived at the station early in the morning, her hair neatly done, wearing her prettiest clothes, and holding a bouquet of flowers tightly in her hand. However, as more and more people arrived, she was gradually pushed far away. She could hear Lincoln's speech, but her view was blocked by adults, and no matter how hard she tried to see if the great man had grown a beard, she couldn't see Lincoln's face.</p>
<p>As Lincoln's speech gradually drew to a close, Grace's heart grew heavy: perhaps he would just hop on the train and leave Westfield like this, and it would be difficult for her to see him again.</p>
<p>But Lincoln suddenly asked loudly, "There is a friend here who I have corresponded with. If she is here, I would like to meet her."</p>
<p>No one stood up to answer him.</p>
<p>A voice rose from the crowd: "Who? Who? What's her name?" "Her name is Grace Bedell. She wrote to me and said that I would look better if I grew a beard."</p>
<p>Amidst laughter, Grace was led to Lincoln. Lincoln stepped down from the platform and shook hands with the little girl. Then, he kissed her.</p>
<p>Pointing to his beard, he said to her, "Grace, I took your advice and grew a beard."</p>
<p>The Grace of that time later became Mrs. George Billings. Recalling the events of that day, she said, "The president's actions were so unexpected that I was embarrassed and quickly ran home, avoiding carriages on the road as much as possible. At one point, I even crawled under a carriage. When I got home, I suddenly remembered that the bouquet of roses in my hand was originally meant to be presented to him, but I had completely forgotten about it when I saw him. Looking closely, I realized that all that remained in my hand were a few flower stems."</p>
<p>The newspapers at the time widely publicized this event, with The New York Tribune running the headline "Beautiful Girl Kisses President"; The St. Louis Republican jokingly said that if kissing girls was one of the president's privileges, then Mrs. Lincoln, in order to safeguard her own rights, should strive for a veto in this regard.</p>
<h3>Carefree Flower</h3>
<p>— Chen Shenyan</p>
<p>Chapter 12: A Chance Encounter (96)</p>
<p>Qi Wan quickly turned her head and saw Niao Yun wearing an overcoat, holding a cane in one hand, walking over from the east side. Qi Wan was delighted to see him, as if she had something to ask him, but when Niao Yun stood in front of her, she felt unable to say anything, and only blankly asked: "Where is Mr. Liu going?" Niao Yun took off his otter fur hat, saying, "I've been running around all day, but I haven't achieved anything. It's infuriating!" Qi Wan said, "What are you so busy with, Mr. Liu? Can you tell me?" Chun Yun said, "The main reason for my coming to Beiping this time is to find a few good actors to cooperate with my upcoming film. Before I came to Beiping, I had already contacted a few friends in Beiping, and there were a few young ladies who seemed interested in joining the silver screen and showing off their talents. But not long after I arrived in Beiping, I fell ill and stayed in this hospital for more than half a month. Now that I've recovered, the hospital has allowed me to go out and walk around. Today I went to find the friends who originally introduced me to these young ladies and contacted them, but some of them were in school, and others had already been hired by theater groups. Judging from this situation, I'm afraid my plans will fall through." As he spoke, he looked very disappointed. Qi Wan heard this and couldn't help but feel a stir in her heart, asking, "What are you going to do now?" Niao Yun said, "I'll have to find another way!" Qi Wan said, "Are you looking for these young ladies to play the lead roles in the film?" Dao Yun said, "I can't say for sure yet, it will depend on meeting them first. It's really not easy to find a suitable talent." Qi Wan said, "Can someone with my qualifications appear on the silver screen?" Wu Yun heard this and said with surprise and joy, "It would be wonderful if Miss Gu would appear on the silver screen!" Qi Wan said, "Really?" Dao Yun said, "With Miss Gu's dancing experience, she's more than qualified to be under the spotlight. Besides, as long as the name Gu Qi Wan appears on the film, it will shake society!" As he spoke, he smiled slightly. Qi Wan lowered her head and said nothing. Niao Yun took a step closer and said, "It's too windy here, Miss Gu has just recovered, please come inside and let's discuss it further." Qi Wan nodded and went to the room with Dao Yun. Niao Yun said, "Just now Miss Gu said she wanted to dedicate herself to the silver screen, I wonder if she really has this plan?" Qi Wan said, "This is my hope, but I'm afraid my abilities aren't up to par." Dao Yun said, "As long as Miss Gu is interested in this path, there's no way she won't succeed." Qi Wan said, "If Mr. Liu thinks it's possible, I must give it a try." Dao Yun said, "I am very grateful for Miss Gu's help. What I mean is, I want to further cooperate with each other." Qi Wan was stunned when she suddenly heard this sentence.</p>

<h3>Mother is Old, Son is Young, Livelihood is Gone – Introduction to Mrs. Wang</h3>
<p>To the esteemed editor: My husband, Wang Shiqing, is thirty-four years old this year. He left home for Shanghai in the early stages of the War of Resistance to make a living, and has never returned since. However, he used to correspond by letter, but in 1941, all communication suddenly ceased. Some say he is wandering in other provinces, others say his whereabouts are unknown. In short, it has been seven years, and there has been no news. Although we have searched in many ways, we do not know his whereabouts, and it is difficult to determine whether he is alive or dead. At home, there is an elderly mother above and a weak wife and young children below. Amidst this high cost of living, the family's livelihood is cut off, and we live each day like a year, feeling lonely and miserable. The mother grieves for her son, the wife yearns for her husband, and the mother-in-law and child weep with tears all day long. We have long admired your newspaper for serving the public, and we earnestly request that you lend us a corner of your social services column to publish this information, so that we may be able to reunite our family and be grateful forever! With this request, Shou Wangshi of Huashe Town, Shaoxing, respectfully presents.</p>
<h3>Forwarded Mail</h3>
<p>To Mr. Ma Peiyuan: This column received a letter from reader Ma Peidi, which states: "I read the marriage announcement advertisement in the Shen Bao on December 21, 1947, and the person involved is Mr. Ma Peiyuan. I am originally from Sui County and a follower of Islam. When my sixth paternal uncle, Fo Qiao, compiled the family genealogy in 1941, the name of my cousin Peiyuan was printed on it, as the eldest son of my distant uncle Zhen He (Zhen Hai). It was also noted that he had moved to Qingjiangpu, Jiangsu Province, so this Mr. Ma may be my cousin. My mailing address is 50 Xishi Street, Kaifeng City. Please ask your newspaper to find a way to inform him." We are forwarding this notification to you, hoping you will investigate. (Editor)</p>
