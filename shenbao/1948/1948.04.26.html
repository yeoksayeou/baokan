<h3>副總統選舉發生波折　國大休會進行勸解　主席表示尊重大會意見</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿五日電〕國大主席團廿五日晚舉行第卅六次會議，討論程潛，李宗仁，孫科表示放棄副總統競選問題，胡適主席，首由秘書長洪蘭友報吿收到程·李·孫三氏之放棄競選聲明，繼即討論是否接受問題，經二小時餘之研究，咸認爲主席團無權接受，決議仍勸程潛·李宗仁·孫科三氏繼續競選，當推定胡適，于斌，曾寳蓀，陳啓天，孫亞夫等五人進行勸解工作，定廿六日上午往訪李宗仁，孫科，程潛，勸渠等撤回放棄競選之聲明，並決定廿六日休會一日，以便進行會外協商，俾副總統可以早日順利選出，而利大會之進行。主席團定於廿六日下午四時再舉行會議，研討胡·于等五人勸慰程·李·孫之結果，再決定廿七日大會之議程。又主席團廿五日晚舉行會議時，王寵惠，白崇禧於勸慰程·李·孫三人後，曾於晚十時半蒞會，報吿奉中常會命與張羣，張厲生，陳布雷，張知本等勸程·李·孫繼續競選之經過。據白及王報吿稱：孫程二氏均表示，聲明放棄競選書已送至主席團，留待大會之決定，不擬撤回，惟在大會未決定前，爲接受各方之勸促，可不另繼續作放棄競選之表示。李宗仁氏則表示熊度堅決，仍堅持放棄，尙待繼續勸促。李並表示其放棄競選之聲明不擬撤回。</p>
<p>〔中央社南京廿五日電〕國民黨中常會廿五日下午四時舉行臨時會議，出席中央執監常務委員居正，李文範，吳忠信，吳敬恒，王寵惠，邵力子等五十人，蔣總裁親臨主席，首由蔣總裁說明副總統候選人程潛，李宗仁，孫科三同志，相繼聲明放棄競選，本黨對此問題，應有何決定，請各委員討論。旋由各委員相繼發言，經一小時半之討論，蔣總裁歸納各委員之意見，並作指示如下：（一）國民大會本屆選舉副總統，係根據選舉罷免法進行，本黨唯有尊重大會代表之公意，不應另作決定。（二）程·李·孫三同志，放棄競選聲明之法律解釋，亦應由大會主席團作成報吿，提出大會。（三）爲解除本黨同志間之誤會，並促進團結起見，希望競選同志，能即時停止宣傳，此項工作，推定由王寵惠·張羣·白崇禧·張知本·陳布雷·張厲生六同志負責進行</p>
<p>〔本報南京廿五日電〕副總統候選人之一孫科，廿五日晨放棄參加副總統競選後，蔣主席於十二時曾召見孫氏，就渠之放棄問題有所垂詢，談話達一小時，孫氏始辭出。</p>
<h3>程潛李宗仁孫科　均宣布放棄竸選　澄清謠諑樹立民主模範</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿五日電〕副總統選舉突生波折，獲票最多之三候選人已先後宣布放棄競選，程潛係國大第二次選舉副總統大會獲票最少者，渠於廿四日下午曾晋謁蔣主席，當晚八時，程氏在中央飯店招待其助選團，表示即向國大主席團聲明放棄副總統候選人之資格。廿五日淸晨二時，李宗仁氏亦決定放棄競選，其助選會當夜向新民報發出放棄競選之啓事，謂有人散發傳單，公開攻擊李氏，李氏爲表示其光明磊落之態度，已向國大主席團聲明放棄副總統競選，另一候選人孫科，廿五日晨獲悉程。李兩氏相繼放棄競選後，亦立即決定向國大主席團聲明放棄候選人資格。廿五日午此項消息證實後，京中央日報於下午一時半發出號外，除刊載上項消息外，並載有「本報訊」，據稱：「孫科放棄競選之決定，係爲澄淸謠諑，解除誤會，促進團結，樹立良好民主模範」。中央日報記者並附加按語云：「中國國民黨在國民大會　佔有多數議席，惟對於首任謂總統候選人，在大選之前未經決定。中央臨時全會對於孫·于·李·程四氏已許可其自由競選。本黨亦從未有假借任何名義操縱選票之事，因此國民大會選舉副總統時，兩次投票均無人能超渦代表總額之半數。代表在會塲內外之活動至爲熱烈，充分表現民主自由之精神。惜若干報紙竟有互相攻擊之言論與新聞，致令謠言蜂起。其最足以引起誤會者，爲本月廿三日新民報所載南京交通服務社啓事，其中竟謂：「有人認爲大總統蔣公與李先生曾有一度因政見不合，難免彼此心理不相調和，蔣公因而不願支持李氏。」又謂「國民黨某有力人士欲以黨之全力使某公競選成功」，並指某有力人士爲陳立夫先生，更有一段竟稱「蔣公應利用其國際成望，不時歐遊訪問，籍以增進國際對我諒解，李先生倘能膺選，對於安定時局勝任有餘，對外亦足具條件」。此種幼稚宣傳，原可付諸一笑，不料即由此而引起國大代表及一般社會之謠諑。在各種謠言傳布之中，報紙及傳單之互相攻擊，遂使各候選人之間發生誤會。於是孫科乃繼程，李兩氏之後，亦聲明放棄競選，一切謠言與誤會諒可爲之澄淸」。</p>
<p>〔本報南京廿五日電〕副總統之選舉，於進行至第三次會時，已遭遇阻碍，第三次選舉副總統大會，廿五日晨臨時決定停開。廿五日晨九時，各代表仍赴國大會堂集會，惟若干代表未簽到，九時五十分，秘書長洪蘭友報吿，已簽到代表爲一八七五人，惟在塲人數當較此數爲多。當洪氏報吿時，若干代表紛紛起立，人聲嘈雜，其報告曾數次爲會塲中之呌囂所阻。本日大會主席李文範當報吿主席團所接李代表宏毅等三百卅二人之臨時動議一件，略謂，査本會連日大會進行選舉，代表等精神疲倦，今日適爲星期，擬請大會休息一天，於下星期一進行複選，選舉爲國家大典，甚望能從容鄭重，所請休息一日，擬請交大會討論。經主席徵詢大會無異議通過，即宣布散會，各代表乃於嘈雜聲中紛紛離塲。</p>
<p>〔中央社南京廿五日電〕副總統候選人程潛，廿四日晚八時假中央飯店孔雀餐廳，約集支持渠競選之國大代表及助選委員會主持人茶話，渠即席表示，本謙讓克己之旨，放棄副總統被選舉權，對支持渠競選者，並誌謝忱。程氏今復發表書面談話，原文如次：</p>
<p>「本人此次參加副總統競選，原冀爲民主憲政而努力，承代表諸公，鑒其拙誠·力予支持，感荷無量。現已投票兩次，仍無人當選，而競選者，固管本黨同志，無論何人當選，均足欣慰，國家多事，團結至要，和諧爲團結之基，克己爲民主之本，爰本此旨，放棄被選舉權，敬請愛我之諸位代表先生，於其餘兩位候選人中，另擇一位接近諸公理想者，谷投下神聖的一票，本人但願副總統提前選出，大會圓滿閉幕，新政府早一日成立，即人民早一日蘇息，個人進退，不足介懷，諸友隆誼，永誌弗忘」。</p>
<p>〔又電〕副總統候選人之一李宗仁氏，廿五日突繼另一候選人程潛氏之綫宣布放棄競選。李氏於渠致國民大會主席團之函中表示，渠此次競選動機，原爲效忠黨國，個人得失，在所不計，鑒於日前選舉情形「競選已失其意義」，用特正式聲明放棄競選。</p>
<p>〔又電〕頃據孫副主席競選副總統助選委員會發表：「孫副主席爲肅淸外間流言，並加强團結力量起見，於廿五日晨聲明自動放棄競選副總統，聽候國民黨的決定」。</p>
<h3>民社黨將表明態度</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿五日電〕國民大會因選舉副總統而受阻礙，致有休會等情事　發生。民社黨將於廿六日午發表該黨對此態度之聲明。又該黨領袖張君勸已抵京，據悉：該黨對廿二日國務會議中所通過增加立委名額一事表示反對，已致書蔣主席，說明不同意之理由，現尙未獲覆函。</p>
<h3>臺灣人民團體聲明　要求「自治」眞相　促進國家富強並非與祖國脫離</h3>
<p>〔中央社台北廿五日電〕台省國大代表在國民大會提出要求實施地方自治後，外間傳說紛紜，報紙且以大字標題，謂為「臺灣要求目治」，現為避免國內外誤會起見，台省各人民及文化團體，特作聲明如下：自治決非脫離，我們是要求根據憲法而實施的甸未獨立以前向美英所要求的自治，尤非台省在日人統治時代，向日人要求的自治，因爲台灣的人民，是大中華的民族，台灣的土地是大中華民國的國土，我們是國家的主人翁，而不是殖民地的人民，此其一；我們的所謂「自治」是地方自治，是眞正的民主政治，絕對不許可少數野心份了，利用這機會，作官發財，此其二；台灣之作爲實施自治示範區，是要促成全國地方自治的實現，故其目的，在積極參加國家政治，貢獻合灣一切力量，達成國家的富强康樂，而非與祖國分離，此其三。以上所述，爲我全合各人民及文化團體之公意，亦爲提出台省實施地方自治之眞正動機，須用以正告國內外者也。</p>
<h3>簽署當選國代　今日發給證書</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿五日電〕簽署代表發給當選證書問題，廿五日經陳立夫與張厲生商洽結果，已有所決定，將於廿六日上午十一時由選總所發給，如證書一時印製不齊，亦先發給一臨時證明文件。簽署代表領得當選證書後，原規定應寫一退　書，現決定已可不用退議字樣，而僅由簽署代表寫一本次不出席大會之聲明，其聲明書中除說明其得票最多已依法當選外，並說明茲遵奉總裁歷次勸諭及國大主席團于斌·王雲五等諸先生之說明，依照選舉結果發給當選證書，為頭全事實困難，本屆第一次國民大會願不出席，嗣後本黨允予補辦職婦團體增加名額選舉時，即以此次之當選證書換領新證書，否則即以原證書出席下次國民大會，而將同一地區之友黨叧行設法。</p>

<p>廿五日是星期休假日，首都市民淸早起來都準備中午聽副總統選舉情形的廣播，下午郊遊，晚上看電影，但祗有和國民大會有直接關係的人才沒有這種逸緻閑情，上午八時多，但李宗仁助選會關於李氏放棄競選的鄭重聲明，震驚了會塲內外，隨後程潛放棄競選的消息也經證實，一時揣猜紛紜，大門口的憲兵仍舊向到會代表高叫：「請攜帶代表出席證」，但在人叢裏再不見競選人和他們夫人的身影了，等一等，孫科競選廣播車上也悄然無聲，會堂裏外一片陰沉景象</p>
<p>時間迂緩的在人們心上爬行，到上午九時半，會塲里已是滿坑滿谷，代表們有的議論哄哄，有的則靜坐觀看文件，有李宗仁的鄭重聲明，有孫科的强調文人政治家與東北重要性，有兩人對各代表　意支持之謝函，也有成爲學氏放棄競選起因的反面的宣傳品。新聞記者們更是神情緊張，東奔西尋，包圍各方面的關係人，窮究細問，但除了知這主席團正在後台開會討論李程兩人關於放棄競選的聲明函件外，大家都在等待，有的等着畫圈圈投票，有的等着看究竟，直到上午九時四十五分，會塲後排四川代表席問響起了當聲，原來是于右老經過那裏往外走，過一會他又在掌聲裏走進來，走到第一排他的席次前，掌聲越來越響，最後全塲竟都歡呼，右老一面點頭道謝，一面直擺兩手，請大家安靜。在水銀燈下面孔興意而通紅，銀　也格外傷逸，兩眼裏內着　潤的感激光芒，着裏說不出話來。這掌聲與歡呼足響了一分鐘，會塲裏話題都轉到右老身上，沒有誰不在說：「老人風度的是第一，便是勝利者也難獲得如此光榮。」十分鐘以後，一個新疆代表說：「爲甚麼到今天大家才認識了于先生的風度！」</p>
<p>到了九時五十分，大會主席李文範剛剛就位，樓上下便開始了呌　，雖在混亂裏，誰也聽不淸吵些甚麽，從方位看，顯然的是北方，華中和西南的代表們反對李宗仁和程濳的放棄競選。好容易洪　友才得到　會報吿人數：他說「……出席簽到代表一八七五人，不過看會塲的人數決不止這個數目，一定還有很多位代表出席了而不曾簽到」，而接着李主席便請洪秘書長宣讀河南李宏毅等三百五十二人的臨時動議，說是選舉已　運續進行了兩天，大家都因為緊張以致疲乏，廿五日又是禮拜天，應當休息休息。這動議立即在無異議情形下通過。主席連說：「本日休會，散會·散會」</p>
<p>這個臨時動議暫時解決了好多難題，答　了好多疑盧，沖淡了幾許險沉，甚至救了不少心膝病患者的性命。代表們散去，有的到燕子　看大江東去，瞻仰一下乾隆發抒愛民之情的御碑，有的再去陵園靈谷寺追念先烈，默賞殘春，有的在玄武公園參加紅十字會的遊園會，盪舟吃櫻桃，也有看電影，　馬路，消磨假期的，但繼續緊張集會商量辦法等待消息的，却佔絕大多數。</p>
<p>事情原委是這樣的：程潛在廿四日複選裏，票數落後很多，事後爲了使選舉早日有結果，爲了競爭者的友誼，他當晚便向主席團聲明放棄競選，廿五日休會後，他和他的助選會的人員都對往訪記者說：「放棄競選全是自動，旣然自己德　能鮮，常然知難而退」。李宗仁本是兩次選舉的第一名，得票獨多，但在廿五日晨三時突然的新民報接到了他的助選團鄭重聲明的廣吿稿。裏面說因爲最近有人散發傳單。公開攻擊他，說他「當選副總統就要逼宮，或三個月後就逼迫領袖出國」，爲了抗議這種「誣衊侮辱」的打擊，他決定放棄競選，「表其光明磊落之態度」。但在他廿五日晨送致大會主席團的正式聲明裏則說：「邇來忽發覺有人以黨之名義壓迫統制，使各代表無怯行使其自由投票之職權」，認爲「競選已失其意義」。廿五日休息後，記者們全找不到李的踪跡，李夫人也不發一語，這是廿五日會前不安情緒的根源，但主席團緊急會議的決定，却是在選舉過程中宣吿放棄於法無據，主席團無權受理。上午十時半孫科夫人出現於空蕩的大會堂中，再過一個鐘頭孫科的自動放棄競選聲明也送到了主席團辦公室裏。他的助選會的聲明裏說，這是爲了肅淸外面流言，一切聽候國民黨決定。廿五日中午擺在人們面前的是一個冷塲，冷得使人幾乎停止呼吸。</p>
<p>午後，國民黨中常會開臨時會，直到傍晚決定，仍然維持自由競選的原則，國民黨中常會和大會主席團都推出了德高望重的人轉寰僵局，並且主席團還決定了廿六日再休會一天，好使這重要的努力有充分的時間進行。廿五日的休會壓平了虛驚，廿六日的休會，也許會把死棋挽回。（四月廿五日於南京）</p>

<h3>社論　學潮中教授的地位</h3>
<p>最近一月以來，　國又有許多大學學生發生學潮，其導因各不　　，其所表現的共同行動則是　課。事態複雜，傳聞難詳，波們於此殊不易槪括實論。可是我們一念高等敎育關係國家前論之　，卻不能不就此說幾句話。</p>
<p>當此大局多事人心浮動之秋，尤其在目前學潮中感情意氣激　之中，我們很難實　靑年能平情靜氣來審察事理，以發揮多數人的意志，或　取社會的忠吿；但是我們最關心的，還是這許參大學生的寶貴　業的損失。我們相信最關念學生學業的，當然是他們的家長，其次則莫過於躬親敎導他們的敎授，而家長對於平息學潮與他們子女的善導，還是屬望於敎授，</p>
<p>歐　年來許多學校罷課風潮之中，我們不能諱言多數敎授往往抱着任其自然的靜觀態度。他們在理論上不會贊成罷課的手段，但不曾有集體的力量來阻止，甚至有人好似自處於客體而以爲這是學生與政府間的間題。靜觀放任的的態度，使交長的決策减少力量，使多數好學的學生表示意見失其鼓勵，而使少數控制操縱的企圖更無顧忌！這種事實和意識，我們以爲多少是受了生活艱苦與對現實政治反感的影響。因此我們深感從精神上和物質上改進敎授的生活，不僅是發揮敎授在學校中道義力量的前提，而且實爲政府與社會共應肩負的嚴肅責任。要知道大學敎授負責下一代社會幹部人才的作育，而其今日的生活與處境較戰時更爲艱苦。所以今後除薪俸已確定指數調整之原則外，對於分發的迅速，研究獎金的提高，以及福利事業的多方籌劃，敎育行政當局必須切實負起責任，從改進敎育人員待遇上作鍛大的努力。</p>
<p>敎授的生活必須保障，而敎授的地位尤須尊重。衣食住行種種條件是生活，而硏究學問，傳授知識，或昔賢所謂「傳道解惑」，則是代表敎師的生存或生命。而在現行學校制度中，這傳授培育的任務，其主要方式就是上課。所以　業的繼續，是敎擾眞正生命之所寄；而使課業停輟的行爲，就是蔑視乃至否定敎授地位和存在。所以學生之任意罷課，不論其所援理由何在，也不提他們違犯校紀的責任，對敎授絕對是一種漠視譏刺和侮辱。試想一位誨人不倦的博學敎授，挾着書上課堂而發現沒有一個學生來到時，其心情將如何難堪？又假定若干住所甚遠的敎授，僕僕來往以從學生自治會消息中探問是否復課或什麼「休罷」之時，其地位又何等可憐？此在二三年來身厥其境的敎授感之最切，不容我們饒舌了。</p>
<p>學校行政的瑣節，一般敎授因專志敎學，厭於與聞；就是訓導方面如兼任導師，敎授亦多不樂分心，這是專科以上學校的常情。可是現在對於威脅敎授本身生存之動輒罷課的行爲。敎授爲人爲己，都不容再置身事外了。大學的基本使命是培養理知，育成專材。罷課雖不必與暴力偕進，至少是反於「訴之於理知」的。此種消極方式，只是毀滅學生自已的學業，否定敎授的地位，同時即窒息敎育的功用。尤其近年所在輕易使用，誠所謂失去警惕的作用，徒喪社會的同情，實際就等於自殺。此在血氣方　之靑年，理性或有所蔽；若以敎授學者之智。與其愛護學生之切，豈有不辦之甚明？　前毖後，有心的敎授應不甘長此旁觀，任學生憲氣爲進退，以毁滅自已紳聖的使命。</p>
<p>從前有人對大學敎育有「多涵育，少干涉」的建議，時至今日，政府對於大學，大學當局對於學生，已可謂盡不干涉的極政。針對現實情形，體察與情要求，我們所願大舉校長與敎授致力者，却是「多負責，少放任」。所謂負責，在敎授不僅限於敎書分內之事，而首在確立敎育與敎授的尊嚴，共謀安定講學的環境。大學行政當局，於學生合理的要求，當負責解決，或轉呈政府力爭；於超出情理之外者，必負責糾正。敎授於此，當輔助校長，通過校務會議與敎授會職權的運用，以雜護學校的安定與風氣的改善。世局之嚴重如彼，國家科學之落後如此，最須急起直追的正是大學敎育；這不是放任因循的時候了。</p>
<p>記得戰時重慶大學會發生拒絕校長的風潮，大公報故總主筆張季鸞先生慨論學風，對大學生之誤解自由與『一部份敎授之容悅求安」，正言糾彈，以爲「敎授對政府之對立鳴高，與對學生之縱容姑息，智是害及國家」。春秋責備之旨，老成憂國之心，眞所謂言者無罪，聞者足戒。我們鑒於學潮之各種起因，敎育行政當局固當負責處理，惟罷課實戕賊靑年敎育與國脈，敎授在道義上，職責上都不能辭其疏導防弭的責任。</p>
<h3>中美對執行援華方案　原則上獲致協議　貝祖詒離美返國卅日可抵京</h3>

<p>〔本報錦州廿日航訊〕北辨路，是關內外的轍血管，自從這條轍血管患着血管破裂症後，因爲阻塞破裂，幾致脈斷窒息，幸賴千百個醫生般的熟練工人，熱情耐心的醫治接補，復得有像今天的通順和活力！</p>
<p>兩個機構　這條輪血管，有兩個控制它的機關，關內平褕間，屬於「平津區　路管理局」，楡瀋段屬於「錦州區鐵路管理局」，平津區局轄界內，平津間完好，津楡間創傷頗大，出了山海關，滿目狼煙，不忍卒睹。</p>
<p>火車開出了北平，可以快速的奔馳，沒有什麽阻碍，過了天津，起先還好，走近「蘆台」，破壞的痕跡，逐漸的呈現在眼前，唐山到山海關間有幾段比較最慘烈，「石門」，「朱莊」各「留守營」，燒的好苦，站房，電桿，都還擺着共匪火攻的兇殘塲面</p>
<p>坐着　州鐵路管理局的客車，出關東進，駛向萬家屯，在這一段裏，還保留着雙軌，接着是「前所」「高嶺」「前衛」「荒地」「沙後所」「白廟子」等站，過去大家都常在報上看見這些一迎串的地名，這都是被破壞得最厲害的地方。</p>
<p>殘餘電桿　路旁的電桿，鋸的鋸，燒的燒，電桿上的自磁瓶，成了渣片，一堆堆的棄置電桿附近，聽說這是共匪把它一個個敲碎的，路局爲了急於通車，有的把剩餘的桿頭，繼上了桿座，有的換上了細弱的木桿，也有的把剩下較長的桿頭，直接揷在地裏，高高低低，歪歪斜斜，電綫總算連在了一起。</p>
<p>站房沒有的，搭架了板棚，站長和站員多有在露天辦公的，他們旣須全力工作，又得防備着突然來的災難，有些站員被擄去而又輾轉的跑回來繼續他們的工作，他們拿着小教的薪金，艱辛拼命爲着交通堅守崗位。</p>
<p>鐵道被翻身或是燒拆的破壞，如情形許可，都得立刻搶修，有時白天搶修，夜裏又遭到破壞，搶修，破壞，破壞，搶修，這樣的經過了很久的時候，搶修終於勝過了破壞，這些無名英雄的精神，使人萬分的欽佩，可是他們所得的報酬却是冰冷和低微。</p>
<p>整修橋樑　橋樑，幾乎沒有一座是完整無缺的，好多的還擺着坍毁的橋樑，伴着摔下的機車和車皮，錦局現正以最大的努力，整修大小橋樑，記者看到已經恢復了好些座大橋，有的則正在灈水泥或架鐵架。</p>
<p>路旁時常有警吿司機「一停再開」减爲每小時五公里速度的標牌，那都是說明前面的橋樑有問題，火車走起來很吃力，今後如得喘息，在大水期以前，　致可以把錦楡間的橋樑，恢復到和從前差不多的情勢，至於其餘像號誌，電訊，站房等，那還得長久的時期。</p>
<p>先修便橋　目前，關外錦瀋段，是在匪軍的控制區域，僅濟陽至新民間五十多公里的地方在通車，錦局面臨着第一關是大凌河橋，上下綫經過共匪兩次的玻璃，已經無一完整橋墩。</p>
<p>若軍事開展，得先修便橋，所需木椿極多，聽說錦局已做了準備，當路局和軍方去視察的時候，都遭到了對岸的射擊，匪軍經常派有騎哨監視國軍和路局修橋的動態，但，遲早是要修的。</p>
<p>佈八卦陣　軍事當局，爲了保護這條命脈，已下了決心，同時也要打開北寗路的整個交通，我們看到了關內唐山榆關間的戒備森嚴，同時更看到了關外段的更爲週密，都是在表示不能讓共匪再破壞了。</p>
<p>看，村鎭，車站，到處在掘戰壕，作工事，好多的車站附近，裏三層外三層的斜插削尖木樁柵欄，裏面又有　溝，鐵蒺　，有梅花椿般的「鹿砦」，此外則是地上的地下的各式的　堡，地上地下相連，母　，子碉，形成一個碉堡羣，聲息相通，緊密連繫，眞是佈好了八卦陣，專等敵人來！</p>
<p>北寗路的員工，爲着這條交通命脈努力，國軍也在處處佈置強大火網，看情形已通的不能呌它再出大毛病，沒通的軍事當局正在趕做「打通」的準備！</p>

<h3>巴勒斯坦戰火蔓延　猶軍猛攻雅法城　該城市長已電克銀漢請派英軍干涉　預料阿拉伯軍無法久守</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕倫敦廿五日廣播：阿拉伯領袖今日同意中止自海發撤退阿拉伯居民。猶太方面允派警察保護，並成立阿猶委負會仲裁糾紛。</p>
<p>〔路透社台拉維夫廿五日電〕猶太地下團體伊爾根軍業於廿五日淸晨開始總攻台拉維夫毗鄰之阿拉伯城雅法，猶太自衛軍哈迦那駐守雅法合拉維夫交界處袖手作壁上觀。伊爾根軍三千名經竟夜之籌備後，於夜間越界侵雅法。猶方初步報吿謂雅法之孟辛警察局及火車站已爲伊爾根軍所佔。雅法阿拉伯方面之報吿，承認猶太軍以波浪形向阿拉伯防綫作空前猛烈的衝撲，雅法之阿拉伯首腦部已令全城居民保持鎭定，團結保衛。台拉維夫猶人估計可供防衛雅法之阿拉伯軍約一萬餘人，但相信阿拉伯人必無法久守。耶城英方人十證實雅法市長已急電　銀漢高級專員，請派英軍干涉。雅法爲淸一色之阿拉伯城市，依分治計劃應屬阿拉伯國。耶城阿拉伯人士堅決表示阿拉伯人決不放棄雅法，決當戰至最後一人。猶太方面之戰報指雅法阿拉伯防禦工程已趨崩潰，巷戰正擴大中。外約但王阿勃杜拉頃於該國首都阿曼發表緊急宣言，指伊爾根之進攻雅法並無戰略上的藉口，渠並鼓勵阿拉伯人繼續戰鬥，不可放棄，蓋援軍已在途中。同時台拉維夫城內局勢亦欠明朗，若干房屋起火焚燒中，交通制度呈完全紊亂狀態。</p>
<p>〔路透社耶路撒冷廿五日電〕猶太公會人士稱，進攻雅法之伊爾根軍愈戰愈勇，阿拉伯軍向郊外村莊潰逃，預料廿六日破曉，伊爾根軍即可完全佔領雅法。</p>
<p>〔合衆社貝魯特廿四日電〕權威人士廿四日稱，阿拉伯聯盟業已決議不派正規軍進入巴勒斯坦。阿盟本週曾在亞曼舉行一連串會議，決議將阿拉伯解放軍歸外約但國王阿勃杜拉統率，其麾下之阿拉伯外籍軍將在各國阿非正規軍之協助下，展開攻擊。阿盟之所以作出決定，蓋外約但爲唯一不受聯合國拘束之阿拉伯國家，而其他國家悉爲聯合國會員國。阿盟計劃暫時由阿拉伯外籍軍佔領巴勒斯坦一部份，一俟英軍撤退，即開始行動，而由阿勃杜拉保證將來撤軍由巴勒斯坦人民自行決定其政體。</p>
<p>〔聯合社耶路撒冷廿四日電〕海發今日來電稱，猶太當局現擬阻止阿拉伯人三萬七千名撤退，認爲此種撤退乃政治上之反抗，故要求阿方留居該地藉以證明可與猶太人共同生活。猶方並願合作解決糧食供應問題。但阿拉伯領袖答稱「不能爲征服者之順民」。</p>

<p>〔合衆社成功湖廿四日電〕中國駐聯合國代表團廿四日發表正式文告，否認曾在紐約舉行談判，商討派遣中國電隊執行巴勒斯坦托管事之可能性。然此文吿並未否認在他處或有是項談判舉行。（南京外交部發言人對此報吿拒絕批評，觀察家乃認爲談判或在他處舉行）。</p>
<p>〔路透社成功湖廿四日電〕英美法代表今日曾討論簡化的巴勒斯坦托管計劃，俾得由聯大迅速通過作爲過渡措施。簡化計劃的內容與美國所提原案無根本上的不同，僅使設立巴勒斯坦臨時政府之程序爲之簡化。在此計劃下，巴勒斯坦過渡政府僅設總督一人輔以行政委員會，總督有權於必要時得不問託管協定中有無規定，自行添設其他政府機構，此一簡化計劃得在託管協定中予以修正。</p>
<h3>我與沙地阿拉伯　交換條約批準書</h3>
<p>〔聯合社開羅廿四日電〕此間今日宣佈，中國與沙地阿拉伯已交換友誼條約之批准書，該條約於十七個月前在吉達簽字。</p>

<p>〔路透社倫敦廿五日電〕政界人士相信，自義大利投入西方陣綫後，東西奪取在歐優勢的鬥爭，將在德國演出下一幕。西方國家在歐洲的政治設計中，已獲重大進展，今祗待美國肯定表示對鞏固西歐的努力，擬作如何具體的支援，尤其是在軍事方面。</p>
<p>華盛頓與西歐國家的聯繫，至今尙付缺如，就比總理史巴克自美歸來後之談話觀，美國雖同情西歐公約之防務條款，然尙不欲公開聲明對之作任何具體保證。傳美國在倫敦會議中，要求西德三區合併，迄尙未獲法方之首肯，法國在美國得以提供安全保證前，殊不願西德之參加西歐集團。由於歐洲下一鬥爭序幕之即將揭開，局勢顯基急迫，馬歡爾之匆遽自波哥大趕回，即與打破西歐本身之僵局有關。</p>

<p>〔聯合社華盛頓廿四日電〕國務卿馬歇爾今日自波哥大返此，匆遽結束泛美會塲之「熱戰」，將恢復寰球「對蘇」冷戰中之美國策略指揮。馬氏之返京，引起一般揣測，認爲美當局與西方各國領袖間將及早舉行會議，計劃朮新努力制止蘇聯支持下的歐洲共產主義。但此種會議是否爲馬歇爾與西歐要人如英外長貝文與法外長皮杜爾等之聚首，及會議是否依外交路綫進行，則尙不可知。預料馬歇爾本人將檢討局勢而奠定下星期行動路綫。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕閘北區第八保因地面遼闊，不易管理，區公所奉命將八保劃分為第八保及卅二保，因保長人選問題，發生巨大風波。按該區居民大都係山東，蘇北，安徽等客籍住戶，昨晨八時許，羣衆集合在麥根路難民收容所投票，山東帮選周奇為保長，蘇北帮選戴錦標為保長，雙方選民成立對峙陳線，至十一時左右，山東帮見周奇當選保長無望，即禁止投戴錦標之票，因此引起羣衆不滿，一度人聲鼎沸後，乃展開血戰，千餘選民手持木棍磚石等混戰，旋閘北警分局據報，當由分局長周泗安偕石股長督率制服警便衣警數十名，及保警總隊大批警察，乘車馳往彈壓，一塲風波始逐漸平息。聞雙方受傷者計有汪干文，陶慶奎等卅餘名，均經警舁送醫院療治，至保長則迄至傍晚仍未選出。</p>
<h3>逼供？索賄？　文光廷控拆案　地檢處今偵訊</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕被警局控吿竊盜嫌疑，經法院宣判無罪，繼續覊押多時，始獲保釋之翻砂廠工人文光廷，前曾具函向參議會控訴警員非刑逼供，法警索賄等情，地方法院査良鑑院長對此至為注意，日前特將文之全卷移送地檢處偵査，以明眞相。今日上午將由梁賡舜檢察官開庭，傳文光廷，法警徐敬寬，保人合興翻砂廠主田阿炳等訊問。</p>
<p>文光廷稱　曾遭踢打灌水</p>
<p>關於警局人員濫施酷刑及法警索賄各節，昨據文光廷語上海通訊社記者稱，渠被捕後，曾被關入一狹長之鐵籠子。渠曾要求向外通電話，促友人前來證明其身份，迄未見允。濫施刑罰，係於被捕後翌晨八時開始。審問時因拒絕承認盜匪，曾被摑堂及拳打足踢，繼則縛上一長約五六尺之特製櫈子。灌水時先朦住雙眼，再曚住其嘴，用水向鼻內猛灌，在警局先後被灌五六次。渠憶及在塲之警局人員約三四人，一身穿藏靑中裝，一着靑呢外套，被灌水時，並曾用帆布帶子鞭撻。。關於竊盜案曾開庭四次，均未見原吿出庭。自宣判交保釋放後，其友人德泰鐵工廠工人田良泉持保結前往法院時，因不明手續及漏書刑特字第九九號之文號，有一法警向田表示，如肯出「香烟錢」，當可為之設法査出文號。田先願給四萬元，後加至六萬元。於對保時會有人謂，如願出二三十萬元，可立時前往。對於另復需要五百萬元，係又馬一事。對胡興　翻砂廠聲明於渠被捕前三日業將其解雇一事，文謂：渠被捕係一月十四日，十三日尙由廠方發給工資。此次廠方因懼生意外，為免連累，始出此語。另悉：據警局發表曾被文光廷竊去套鞋，脚盆，火油爐之朱巧賓，日昨語記者：渠確曾被竊上項諸物，茲根據警局來人吿訴，業由文光廷供認為渠所竊云。</p>
<h3>楊景周失蹤前言行奇特　臺警務處踏勘民眾輪　大副旅客述目睹情形</h3>
<p>〔報台北廿五日電〕楊景周失踪案，記者今隨省警務處刑事大隊附林元龍及刑室陳建康，同赴基隆，訪民衆輪，實地査勘。由大副黃豪伯答復各項訊問。據渠稱：楊係購統艙票，因駛出基隆即遇大風浪，統艙無法存身，楊乃與衆旅客雜坐大餐間·至十日午夜二時，有旅客多人曾見其外出，未以為意。時船尙駛於台灣海面。迨十一日午前發覺其仍未歸，而皮包則遣於餐桌上，乃報吿大副，動員搜索，已失蹤跡。時船正駛於浙江海面，撿視皮包內有聖經日記及名片數張，台幣九百元，日記上則有恐怖之記載。至楊上船後因船處險境，無暇查票，幷無補票情事等語。記者曾詢有否藏匿可能，唐稱絕對無此可能，幷曾巡視甲板及厠所等處安全設備，均頗完善，似亦無失足可能。</p>
<p>自稱船票被撕</p>
<p>此時適遇出事前與楊相處最近之旅客鄔鶴鳴，據渠稱，楊上船時曾見船員於入口處査票，因楊無票，阻其上船，經楊說明船票為糖菓廠內人撕去，願再補票，始准上船。且楊當時似神經失常，曾頻呼我是好人，及回岸亦死上船亦死等語。惟此項情形，民衆輪方面未予說實。興合公司亦否認撕楊船票。至楊在碼頭遭包圍事，鄥亦稱未見。</p>
<p>因提指數遭受指責</p>
<p>鄥並詳　楊上船後動態稱，楊向衆宣佈，抵台後曾與糖菓廠工人言及滬地工人待遇係按生活指數計算，致受公司指資不當。渠宣佈此事時，並頻頻聲言：我是基督徒，不是共產黨。當時衆旅客均覺楊言語離奇而竊異之。楊且曾因坐錯座位，受一軍人干涉，楊答稱，縱使我坐，亦坐不久了等語。綜合調査情形，楊景周死亡似已無疑，惟究屬自殺或謀殺，則尙須研究。茲省警務處已決心澈査此案。</p>

<h3>復興公園看農展　陰黯茅屋古老農具　農業危機值得正視</h3>
<p>〔本報特寫〕中國一向號稱以農立國，全國人民有百分之八十務農，但今天國內糧食不能自給自足而尙需依賴國外大量輸入，就可見農業生產的情形如何了。　生長在都市裏的人，大多對農村的一切隔膜得很，這次中國農業科學研究社在復興公園舉行首次農業展覽會，給上海的市民知道一點過去所不知道的事情。正如會塲門口木脾上寫的：『從農展看農村，從農村想農業，從農業念農民，粒粒辛苦，滴滴血汗」！</p>
<p>展覽會的內容說得上豐富，分食，衣，住，行，活的家畜家禽，農業與科學，農業與工業，農業機械，農業照片，農村情况，花卉園藝，熱帶植物等部分。在許多實物，岡表，模型和說明，有系統的組織之下，可使觀衆得到許多農業知識。如果細心地從頭到尾系統地參觀，眞覺得比在大學裏讀一年農學概論還要得益。</p>
<p>會塲義陳列的農貝，從古舊的戽水用的牛車棚，運輸用的獨輪車，到美國新式的帮浦抽水機，掘幷穩，曳引機，磨粉機等，這些在上海市民都感到興趣，雖然其間相差了幾個世紀。牛車胡上寫着「我們祖先偉大的發明，可惜子　一直沒有改進』，今天中國農民戽水灌田時還在應用着它，和那些事國農具相較之下，就知道中國的農業生產為什麽落後了。</p>
<p>今日中國的農民生活怎樣呢？會塲中有一間低陋草屋，屋裏景象陰　陳設簡單，一個紙做的老農正因病躺臥在破絮稻草中，一個年輕的則正獨自倚桌吃飯，吃的是黃米結糠和一碗靑菜，桌上還攤一張高利貸的借據，這景象活描出今日大多數農民悽慘的生活，參觀者對這間茅屋都發生極大興趣：「這是三萬萬五千萬同胞的家」啊！</p>
<p>今日中國農民全仗自己與生俱來的體力，使用初民時代的工具，水旱，虫災，惟大是靠；安危，剝削，時壞恐懼，中國的農業生產非似不科學化，就是原始的生產，也在　退下去，多少田地在荒蕪，多少河道在淤塞，多少役畜被宰殺而沒有補充。從學校裏出來的農科靑年，則非但在農村中沒有他們工作，就是在都市農業機關中也沒有工作可做，普遍的學非所用和不能安心研究，將使中國農業無法進步。</p>
<p>中國農業科學研究社這次在經濟困難條件下，化了十億餘元，辦這樣一個展覽會的目的和意義，是在希望社會人上注意農業的重要，認識今日農業的危機，從而積極的謀求改進之道，「正視農業危機」！希望去參觀過的市民，都能有所警惕。</p>

<h3>司法官應否有黨籍　聯名呈陪轉院請示</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕國民黨各地黨部頃對黨員總登記敦促甚力，各地司法官屬國民黨籍者甚多，照理應即登記。惟依憲法第八十條規定：「法官須超出黨派以外，依據法律獨立審判，不受任何千涉』，是以憲法施行後，司法官不能有黨籍，以便辦案時不偏不倚，公正無私，對於黨員總登記事遂發生疑問。蓋登記則與憲法規定不合，不辦登記則又有違反黨紀之嫌，有無所適從之感。本市司法官曾聯名呈請司法行政部核示，司法行政部對此事亦不能決定，正轉呈行政院請示中。</p>

<p>一般物價</p>
<h3>週初走勢挺秀　入後盤趨下游</h3>
<p>上週物價，承前週疲勞之後，週一開聲靜極思動，在利多消息頻傳之下，一般趨勞，均極挺秀，尤以股票與一般金融性商品為甚。自週二起，利多消息，未能證實，浮多護利吐售，幾又一致回跌，以後漸成盤局，迨至週末，又多接近前週末之原盤。上週銀根仍甚鬆動，國行票據交換情形，差進差出互見，暗息除週五降至二角五分半外，始終站定二角六七分之間。　通貨膨脹後期，人民心理極度脆弱，物價漲跌，最易受外來因素之影響，反應特別靈敏，此種特徽，本刋前已一再述之。上週物價，週一猛漲，週二回跌，一日之隔，趨勢迴異，此種走勢，充實分表現前述特徽之作用及投機動機之顯著，茲將造成此種念促漲落之原因，分列如後：</p>
<p>關於週一物價猛漲方面：（一）最近一次外匯率的調整，始自四月六日，即上週前之第二週，當時外匯平衡基金委員會將各種外匯提高百分之廿五至廿七，美匯基準價升為三十二萬四千元，計漲六萬九千元，英匯九十七萬二千元，計漲二十萬七千元，港匯印匯亦均提升。自去年下半年起，物價漲風週期縮短，速度累進，故政府外匯牌價，亦須不時調整，差堪配合。截至上週一止，政府外匯牌價，已穩定兩週有餘，比之黑市匯率，自然相差日鉅，調整之說，起於前週，及延至上週一，一般揣測，勢在必行，傳說旣盛，刺激價物上漲；（二）香港金匯行市，不啻為法幣價値之指標，且洋股價値，與港幣息息相關，故港匯之伸縮，影響物價起伏極為靈敏，上週一港金匯市塲開盤，法幣百萬元由前週末合港匯八元六七的行盤猛縮至八元，消息傳來為刺激物價上漲之有力因素；（三）最近物價自三月份第二週大漲風後，漸趨平穩，四月份第一二兩週批發物價總指數上升均不及百分之四，在此平疲之局勢下，工商業万面，實銷清淡，而開支並不能因此縮减，且工人工資尙須按生活費指　計算，有不得不靠漲價維持之苦，　勢如此，一旦時機成熟，再加以　機者之推波助瀾，故意拉抬，造成漲風，（四）紗布万面，在上述刺激下，週一又有津粵及漢帮之採辦，納胃甚大，不啻為虎添翼。　自週二起，一般物價，又急劇回落，其原因可得而述者：（一）外匯放長之說未　實現，關於此點，最近外匯管理當局，確甚苦悶，掛高則刺激物價，遭各方之指責，低價則無法吸收外匯資金，僑匯逃避，出口　碍，走私猖獗，頗有進退維谷之苦，（二）在週一之拉抬猛漲情形下，多方旣經獲利，返思吐售，（三）在通貨膨脹日漸惡化的情形下，通貨發行數字愈多，購買力愈降，商品銷路不振，欲購無力，（四）短期國庫券發行條例，已於上週一由國府正式公佈，並傳國行即組織一專門委員會統辦其事，準備委託經紀人於證交以八五折開拍，出現似在目前，投資目標分散，賣方意氣轉盛；（五）紗布方面，因中紡公司照倒配售布疋四十種之多，較上期無增减，以致多頭轉賣蠢起，價趨下游。　此外在上週政府有關物價措施方面可述者有：第一，外交部情報司長時昭瀛週在三行政院新聞局記者招待會聲稱，中國政府對於美援問題已考慮在行政院之下，成立一決定政策之機關，同時，對於現有處理都市糧食供應棉花與石油之各種機構，將充分運用，援華計劃之實際行政工作。第二，財政部對滬穗兩地匯款及運現管理前曾頒實施辦法，近對該辦法第四項內運現用途之範圍復規定兩點，用意在使商業行莊因運現而調　頭寸，必須證明確實，以免蒙混投機。第三，自華股遞延交割奉令停做後，各法人經紀人之銀行及信託公司經營集團套利者，就原有之套利改為星期存款，據調査估計，吸收金額約有二萬億之鉅，此項星期儲蓄存款，各行作何運用，除將該項資金轉放工商業及轉在國行外，是否有琉入投機之行為，金融管理局極為注意，現正派員密査云。第四，食米市塲價格之起伏，以民食調配委員會是否決定收購為轉移，聞收則漲，聞止則平，據該會當局聲稱，計口配糧，原為試辦，四五六三個月之糧食業已籌妥，下一期即七八九三個月之糧食，似尙無着落，祇有向市塲收購一途，但環境如此，茲事體大，該會亦不能貿然從事。日前社會局長吳開先氏曾為此事晋京示，據稱已有結果。再者該會配售工作，繼配米之後，復施行配油，現擬自五月份起，更推廣配售煤斤，其領購手續與配米同。第五，過去國家行局在存放款項方面，向維持低利率政策，此舉已早為多數經　學家所指摘，弊多利少，無庸　述。常局亦已　然於此項傳統作風之不當，圖謀改革，近傳四聯總處已決定採漸進方式調整利率，期在相當時期，能與塲暗息接近。</p>
<p>上週物價之走　，在前述的情形下，起伏鉅而急，但週二以後，則漸形穩定，　趨下游·股市方面，週一開盤，在利多謠　紛傳下，市勢異當堅挺，華股市塲永紗破二千一百關，中泥勤興等十種均達漲限，詳情於本刊下節股市述之。紗布在此種情形下，人心亦大為激動，買氣蓬勃，四十二支藍鳯叩二億四千萬關，較上週末市漲六百萬，二十支雙馬達一億四千四百萬，較上週末市漲九百萬，龍頭細布挺至五百一十六萬，結果以五百零二萬收市。週二起則好景不常，除龍頭細布曾昂達五百二十萬，以四百九十四萬收市外，四十二支藍鳯回落至二億三千五百萬，二十支雙馬回至一億三千八百萬，以後則趨下游，較之前週末收市，榮辱互見，相左無多。食米週一開盤，聞無錫產地米價下洛，兼之到貨有多，實銷不振，價微落，南市塲上白粳每石較上週末回落五萬元為三百七十萬，週二則因無錫米價報漲，民調會又有收購餘米之說，價問升至三百八十萬，以後無錫米價漸平，民調會幷在市塲担售變質白粳，週四又回至三百七十萬，波動幅度尙不算大，始終不出十餘萬元。雜糧食油追隨米糧之後，走勢略同。日用品方面如肥皂火柴等，均以實銷不振，僅微有漲跌。餘如建築材料，化學品，五金等，亦多站盤局，起伏甚微。</p>

<p>上週本市銀根，本可望自鬆轉緊，但由於下列諸因，未能實現。第一，短期國庫券遲遲未見發出；第二，中信局收購之廠商成品雖有標售，但尙未屆收款之期；第三，北方游資，南洗依舊，據報載日本東北游資流入關內者已達萬億以上，其途徑大抵是先到天津再來上海。第四，廣州金融性物品因一時較本市為高，故一部份資金於上週有倒洗入本市的現象；第五，一般物價因實銷呆滯而呈露平疲景象，貨帮旣多觀望，搜求頭寸者自不踴躍；第六，國庫支出浩繁如舊，國家行局自週二以後即見通續寳出。此數因素都是決定上週銀根續見鬆弛的主因。本週以後，如果短期庫券即能如期洗行市面，而成品標售的價款能絡續收回，則銀根可能全面轉緊。</p>
<p>上週自週一至週五，國家行局的交換結果，雖表現為四千八百〇七億的　進，但如扣除五天內商業銀行於國行共九千二百億的定存則國家行局實際尙着出四千三百九十三億。</p>
<p>在商業行莊方面，因需單者少而頭寸供源頗見旺盛，故同業拆放頗見　裁落，求拆自甚為便利，暗息大致站定二角七分，其間週一二天雖曾一度昂達三角，但未幾即又見回降原盤。六十號以後行莊交換結果，自週一至週五共差出一萬〇五百三十九億，差出雖鉅，但行莊方面五天內尙有四千餘億的現鈔解繳國行，頭寸供源之旺可見一般。上週證券帮外貼息，自週一至週三，多方每股貼出自二十二元增至三十三元，空方每股貼進自十九元增至二十元，但週三以後，迭見减少，週五多方僅做二十一元，空方低至十八元。</p>
<p>洋商銀行五天內共差進八千四百三十八億，週二一天之差進，竟創二千八百九十四億之空前高額，上週穗匯匯水雖跌而洋商鉅進有增無减，由此所表現之游資南流之劇烈及其所取之途徑，均堪注目。</p>
<p>（內外匯率）</p>
<p>上週內匯行市，穗匯匯水屢見下落，週二一天竟落至每千元二十元之匯水，其他幾天，亦不過為三四十元之譜，據說係因廣州金融性物品價高，資金倒洗所引起。此外與洋商銀行之增進及美金短期庫券之南洗亦不無關係。資金南逃的途徑雖異，但數額之鉅，仍堪注目。慶匯匯水上週亦自週一的每千元一百五十元續减至週五之一百二十元，渝匯五天內穩站於十元的水準，漢匯亦自四十元减至二十元，津匯貼水一度高遂週一週二的一百三十元，據說與東北萬億以上的資金取道天津南來一事有關。</p>
<p>上週外匯基準來　未見掛高。但香港申匯仍見回縮，週二一天，一度猛縮至港幣七角三分，介法幣十萬元。週三以後，雖稍見放長，但仍較前週軋短，香港　鈔市價約香港幣五元七角左右。波動之輻度在港幣五分之問。</p>
<p>（三）華洋股市</p>
<p>週來華股的行情始終　平疲的局面下徘徊。上週銀根　見鬆馳，港匯亦見報縮，但終以外象平疲，市塲少利買之刺激，加上盛傳國庫券即可洗行市面，銀根可望抽緊，新買多呈觀望，浮多亦願了售，致一週來各股普現疲局，交易亦甚淸淡，其間永紗雖於週初再出二千元關，但嗣後復走疲勢，如此上週週五收價與前週週末開價相比，永紗的軋漲一成，景綸無變化，中絲中泥不過軋漲百分之三，信誼助反見跌落至百分之七，如以上週週五收價與週一收傳始比，則各股普見軋跌一成左右。</p>
<p>於週一突見堅挺，怡紗漲達二九六萬元，較上週六計升二五萬元，其原因為港匯報縮及謠傳外匯開放，　致人心　好，　面籌碼枯竭，市價飛升。英聯則為三四五萬元，會德數為六七〇萬元，俱見償　，但至週三，忽以銀根報緊，紗布回及金融性物品跌，怡紗亦自高價回落，至二七五萬元收　。英聯為三二八萬元，會德豐為六四八萬元。週三因外匯並未掛高，故市價盤旋待徊，漲落甚微。迨週四因散戶略有吸進，稍形堅挺，怡紗復竄出二八〇萬元。英聯在三三〇萬元左右，會德豐為六四〇萬元。週五已成盤局，洗動甚微。週末亦形平疲。總之，此一週末，因外匯掛牌下動，人心黯淡，成交稀少，市價亦難振作。</p>
<h3>工商動態</h3>
<p>（一）中日貿易的「僵局」打　後如何？</p>
<p>陷入僵局已久之中日私人貿易，上週以來頗多重趨活躍的消息，據中央社東京十九日電訊，中國赴日代表團貿易組代表唐菊生氏認為中信局在對日貿易之所欠法幣一百億元之債務乃使中日貿易陷入僵局之主因，而盟總當局更反對以是項債務與對華賠償物資相抵銷的建議，是則在中信局本年度計劃輸日大豆二萬噸豆油五千噸，豆餅五十萬公担花生米三萬公担鹽五十公担生皮一萬公祖之內，必須扣除一部份作為償債之用，在政府貿易範圍以外，私人准許經營者僅麻，桐油麩皮，生鐵，藥材數種，而其貿易量據估計尙不到總貿易額的十分之一，貿易的方式係通過管制機構採取記賬簽設的辦法，亦即如盟總經濟科學組長馬德貴所同意者，採以物易物的方式來彌補外匯的短少，據報載第二批對日私人貿易代表共十二人將於日內分批赴日，廿一日該代表等在本市舉行會議，決定以合作替代競爭，並且計劃輸出大宗農產品。</p>
<p>從種種跡象觀察，假如對日貿易今後將逐漸活躍，則在美國蓄意扶植日本政策下，一工業日本農業中國」的形勢恐依舊仍在，不但如此，中國在風雨飄搖中的民族工業勢必遭受日本工業進一步的摧殘。先就雙方的政府當局說，中國中信局本年度固計劃以大批農產品輪往日本而日本貿易廳亦正計劃以一百萬噸鋼鐵與我等値的錳苗與矽石交換（中央社十五日東京電），另據法國新聞社廿三日東京電，中國海南島再輸出鐵苗八千餘噸供八幡鍊鋼，至於一般所期望的生產器材，如建築用鋼管，鋼板，紡織用鋼絲布業，據報載「日方尙無輸出能力」，由此亦可見中國輸日者仍以原料為主，而日本輸華者，充其量不過直接消費的製成品，無疑的中國工業界將遭到嚴重的打擊！</p>
<p>從華盛頓廿一日的電報中，得悉美國進出口銀行已宣佈該行將聯合商業銀行三家放款六六萬美元以資助日本採購美國棉花。倫敦方面雖一度傳說英美紡織界最近贊同縮减日本棉織業的政策，但美國陸軍部却認為沒有理由，在軍人把持政治的今日之美國，日本之命運當然是決之於美軍部之手，日本紡織業臻臻日上了，據日本紡業協會最近報吿，五月份日本棉紡業達三百十萬紡錠，較二月份增加二萬六千多紡錠（路透社十九日東京電）紡錠增加金元輸入的結局如何呢？結局是至本年一月末日本棉布滯貨已達三億一千二百萬平方碼，價値約一億五千萬美元，同時日本紡織界因外傳本年七月以降之美國會計年度內可輸入美棉一百三十萬包以促進增進工作，故現對於些三億一千二百萬平方碼之滯貨，正考慮其如何處理。中國，由於她的廣大與貧窮，確是處理這筆滯貨的好對象，在對日貿易的「僵局」行將「軟化」之際，倒是値得國人尤其是中國的紡織界警惕。</p>
<p>（二）公用事業價格能穩定嗎？</p>
<p>公用事業的「領導漲價」似亦已激起了參議會袞袞話公的垂注，該會曾於十七日正式電呈行政院，要求迅速考慮停止公用事業價格計算公式之繼續適用，恢復貼補政策，並呈請當局在未決定適當辦法前自五月份起此項公式即應停止適用，以免造成社會不安之嚴重後果。參會除電呈上峯以表示「民意」外，更決定分組調査，以明責任。這可忙壞了本市行政當局，公用局長特於十六日訪晤央行張總裁，十九日上午更有張總裁與吳市長的晤談，據說莫不一致以如何使公用事業價格不劇漲為話題。　市政當局認識所以漲價的邏輯似乎是如此，公用事業之成本主要係外匯，五金原料，燃料，生活指數等，故如政府對公用事業能續採貼補政策，則今後不至再有劇漲，因此公用局長與央行總裁的磋商點，主要在如何提前燃料油及汽油的結匯，燃管會方面亦認為提前撥付公用事業所需煤斤，對公用事業價格的穩定亦有裨益，而公用事業因提前結匯等等所需之款項，央行在原則上據說亦已准允貸借，那末，「五月之穩定」自可以不成問題，這一切措施與理論顯然是根據「一物漲價因為是另一物漲價」的公式訂立的，但常識可以說明，這是一個循環的公式公用事業的漲價固然一部份是由於受生活指數上升的刺激，但生活指數激升又安見不受公用事業漲價的影響呢！貼補政策固然可以穩定公用事業價格於一時，但因貼補而增加的財政上的赤字，仍不能不是一般物價上漲的主要因素，循環的公式仍舊會帶來循環的作用，反正事實會給以最無情的攷驗的！</p>

<h3>生物科學在上海</h3>
<p>— 景一</p>
<p>生物學是二十世紀發展得最迅速的一門科學，除了研究生命問題之外，就是對於農·工·醫學也開關了新的大道，近廿年來它和物理化學發生了聯繫，彼此相携並進，更是一條可貴的途徑。我國從事生物科學研究的人，並不算少，專門的研究機關像北平的靜生生物調査所北平研究院，中國科學社生物研究所，和中央研究院的動植物研究所等都很有，一般大學大都也設有生牧學系，每年派到國外從事專門研究的人也很多，生物學在中國應該有一個蓬勃而希望無窮的將來。的確，這門科學和每個人的生活太接近了，它跟國計民生發生了直接關係，可是事實上一般人還沒有深切認識它的重要，以為花鳥虫魚的研究，只不渦是學問上的點綴，所以生物學在中國還祗在萌芽時期，到今天只不過是學校敎育中的「一個學科」而已。有人以為目下生物學研究不能影響人羣，同時社會上也見不到它，處在這樣的情况下，我們覺得一個學會的誕生，是刻不容緩的，所以我們就成立了「上海市生物學會」，以應此時此地的需求，並得到本市敎育界的贊助，定下了工作計劃，兩個月來，積極推動了會務，（會址在永康路二百號），本着科學的嚴肅態度，以及求眞理的精神，努力向前邁進。</p>
<p>生物學會的基本會員大都是各中學的生物學敎師，所以在敎學改進和普及生物學知識方面，可以有較大的收穫。我們知道，專家們是深　的探討，重在新知學理的發掘，同時要把這些學問傳給多數人知道而且去實踐，這也是不可忽視或許比高深研究更重要，我們的主要任務是：（一）關於生物科學之學說及其技術的研究事項；（二）關於介紹各國生物科學之發展及其敎學情况事項；（三）關於生物學科敎學與實險等敎材之收集與編訂以及改進方法之研究等事項；（四）關於生物科學圖書標本及研究材料等的收集事項；（五）關於生物科學之編輯及出版事項。這五項要目，不僅直接有助於敎學上的改良，同時更影饗於生物科學的推行，至少可以提高一般人對於生物學科的注意和興趣。</p>
<p>今日從事文化工作者，人人給生活壓迫得透不渦氣來，但是生物學會的幾個負責人，他們似乎忘却了這些，很起勁而且熱烈的幹着，一方面得到敎育當局給他們有力的鼓勵，一方面生物學界的先進也特別伸出手來提携他們，因此這學會裏的每個會員都像蜜蜂在薔薇花上忙於工作，傳粉製蜜，造福於社會，這個象徵的確是很有意義的，聽說他們就把這層深意刻進了他們的會徽，作為學會的標記，該會加入了中國科學社為團體社員，這來更得到了實際方面的帮助，他們曾聘請了秉志，盧于道，劉成，王志稼，王家楫諸氏為名譽理事，盼切他們隨時給以指導。同時還希望和各校取得聯絡，這樣範圍更可以擴大。</p>
<p>他們正在計劃編輯一套叢書，內容分生物學通論，人生問題，人體生理，增產技術幾僩重點，學術演講已經請過秉志先生在光華大學講過，現在仍舊繼續舉辦，他們不想向大衆方面作生物知識灌輸的工作，預備和民衆敎育實驗學校取得合作，或者用廣播的方式去推行。這些工作，至少要用時間和精神才能換得到，可是他們只問耕耘，並未計及如何的收穫。</p>
<p>生物敎學的改進，這是一件急不待緩的事，生物學會另組織了一個委員會從事研討，祗有從實地施敎者才能獲得應該注意的各點，將來對於謀程敎材設備都有研究的心得可以發表出來。更可以改進整個科學敎學。來補救目前的缺陷。</p>
<p>生物學會是困於經費，會訊方面已在竭力設法編印中，這一個新生的學術團體，我們希望它滋長起來，由上海而推及全國，研究生物學的同　一定很願意知道這樣的消息。在現在科學在中國處於不安定的現狀下，我們大家應該拿出力量來，促進　國科學化，無論在縱的或是橫的方面。都需要把它發揚起　。上海市生物學會是一粒有活力的稱子　　在萌芽，或許這顆可愛的嫩芽，會欣欣向榮，枝葉茂盛，我們都抱有重樣熱切的　望！</p>
<h3>固體水</h3>
<p>— 葉舖</p>
<p>冰是大家所熟話的，然而對於「固體水」（Solidwater），知道的人就很少了。或許有人認為這就是冰，其實決不是的。雖然它有冰一樣的冷和硬的性質，但是因為冰是結晶體，固體水不是結晶體，所以兩者完全不同。這種新物質，是在一九四〇年由美國聖路易大學（St，Luis　Univessity）的盧義特博士（Dr．B．J．Luyet）發明的。</p>
<p>固體水的製造，並不怎樣繁難。主要的工具，就是孩子們玩的手槍和兩個金屬質的冷凝器。因為在這于槍裏面，裝有彈簧和往復塞（Pludger）等的機件；當把板機扣緊的時候，一洗尋常的水，便從其中射出，平臥在兩個黃銅的圓盤中間。這兩個黃銅的圓盤，是事前準備好的，並且已用液態的空氣，把它的溫度降得很低。射人其間的水，猛然受到了這嚴寒冷却，來不及凍結成冰的結晶，便凝同為玻璃狀的薄膜，附在黃銅的圓盤上，這便是固體水了。</p>
<p>固體水是罕有的，為了要證明它和冰的區別，盧義特博士特地取了一片，放在極冷的玻璃上，置於一具顯微鏡前，和一個交又的起偏極光鏡的活門（Crossed　Polasezersoptical　Valves）配合好；籍着一偏極化光（Polarized—light）的啓示，吿訴我們，除了那放的是結晶體外，絕對沒有光綫透過。在這顯一微鏡的後方，接着一架照相機，靠着照片士所攝下的像，證明了全部是黑暗的，沒有受到感光。這的確是非結晶體的固體水了。接着，這片固體水慢慢地吸收附近的熟度，開始融解，漸次產生結晶，轉變為冰，因此照片感光了，逐漸明亮起來。最後仍舊融化成液體的水。</p>
<h3>愛因斯坦教授</h3>
<p>— 王乾德</p>
<p>相對論創立者愛因期坦敎授（Prol．Albert　Einstein)當希特勒在德國執政時，以猶太族關係，被放逐赴美，在百靈斯墩大學（Princeton　University）高等學術研究所任敎授，繼入美國籍，戰時參與原子彈之研究，大戰吿終，本學者立塲，主張公開原子彈之務密，不贊成管制辦法，惟未為許多美國同道所贊可，近復宣稱，如不利用原子能為人羣造福，彼將停止研究原子能之工作。（或）</p>
<h3>延年有術</h3>
<p>— 王</p>
<p>關於延年益壽工作的首創者，是波哥摩利薩（Bogomolelaz），他那時所採用的方法；是川一種特製的血淸（Serum日），去防止老年的病痛，雖然這方法不能說無效，但至少不是一種長壽的特效藥；而所用的方法只是山一種長物的原理去延長人的生命，所以他的，創造就在不聲不響中消減了，沒有被人大量的採用。</p>
<p>現在蘇聯醫學博士蘇利科夫（Surikov）在莫斯科的第</p>
<p>一華物研究所的生物實驗室衷重新開始他的研究，結果給他發現了，也可以說是成就了，他能用一種方法隔絕「年老的色素」（Pigment　of　old　age）這樣可以延長老年的時日，也就是延長人的壽命。</p>
<p>但什麽是「年老的色素」呢？蘇利科夫只簡單的加以解釋：「它是一種純物質，這種物質在兒童及靑年的身體內是不易找到的，甚至完全沒有我到的可能。</p>
<p>同時實驗室的主任伊林（N．A．Ilyin）博士也發現了一種新法，他在「蘇聯婦女」二月刋上宣佈，一種田腦質物體內榨取而得的粉狀物質，它對於延年益壽也有相當的功效，這種物質就叫做「老年的物質」（Substance　of　old　age）．</p>
<p>這「老年的物質」在那裏找到的呢？它是在活的細胞中找到的，由於這物質的發現與應用，人生的延長就是更多了</p>
<p>一層保障。</p>
<p>雖然生命的延長是有了相當的把握，不過保護自己的身體還是最重要的；你不能吸烟，因為吸烟對於你身體有極大的損害，過度的吸烟會喪失了你的生命，你應當有適當時間的工作和休息，過多的工作和過多的休息也會把你的身體弄壞，並且還得多做體育的練習；所謂體育的練習，就是像多打球，做早操等;這些事尤其是在婦女們應當更進一步的注意，因為疾病給婦女的打擊比男子大得多了。</p>
<p>最後由於引用蒲芳·富魯蘭斯發育定律（Buffon　Furance　Rule）而知道人的生命可以延長到六七倍的靑年發育週期那麼長。換句話說。也就是可延長到一百七十五歲，因為人的靑春發育週期是由二十歲至二十五歲。</p>
<h3>機器怎樣種稻碾米</h3>
<p>向來產米和食米的我國，由於戰災頻仍，居然問向來吃麥的美國人民討米來吃了！據統計：一九四七年由美國裝運到東亞的食米已超過十二萬萬磅。</p>
<p>全世界一半以上的人口是食米的，而且什九都是東方人。可是美國由於機械耕種播植的關係，現在已經成為全世界第二產米國了，我國雖然依舊還是第一產米國，但是單以湖南和廣西兩省計算，已有一千六百萬人口遭受飢饉之災。</p>
<p>一九四六年美國共產米二十一萬萬磅，其中三分之二便是多餘的。米並不是美國的土產，為什麼美國人會這樣的精於種植呢？他們是怎樣種植的？</p>
<p>加里福尼亞的農民用飛機播種穀子在水面上，然後用共乾法（Combinedrie—rmethod）收穫，所以成了全世界機器種米的第一位。他們用曳引機牽動一排闊達三十呎的釘齒耙，佈置苗牀，比較東方用牛來牽引的原始式釘耙，當然不可同日而語。</p>
<p>更重要的是灌溉問題，在東方是用牛馬或人力戽水入田；但在加里福尼亞，農民祇要像旋動自來水管一樣的便利，旋開灌溉水管，水便浩浩蕩蕩的滾流而下，同時對於野草和莠株的刈除，在東方除了用人工遂步拔掉以外，毫無他法，但是在加里福尼亞，農民在收穫以前不久，才把農田去水，餘時則永久浸在水中。因此莠草無由生長，更無除莠必要，此法係二十年前美國農部專家瓊納氏發明，因為稻種能在水中出芽生根土內，而把它第一個葉子伸出水面；但是莠草不能伸出水面，因此死亡。（未完）</p>
<h3>過失心理</h3>
<p>— 黃寶端</p>
<p>過失心理很有研究的價値存在，同時也很有趣味。知道了一些學理以後，對於　將來的事業多少總有一點益處。</p>
<p>先要問你有沒有犯過像下面的幾種種錯誤，或類似的笑話：</p>
<p>（A）明明是你自己把兩柄傘放在室外，但你却在室內東找西找。明明是把東西放在甲處，却在乙處找了半天。</p>
<p>（B）明明你的朋友是「張三，而你却叫錯他是「李四」。有時：竟一時呌不出站在你面前的那一位天天見面的老朋友或同事的名字，但過了一些時候自然而然地又能記起了。</p>
<p>（C）你有時會將「李」和「李」，「端」和「瑞」，＂Bady＂和＂Baby＂或＂bady＂和＂Baby＂或＂Quiet＂和＂Quite＂……等字相互地　錯或是寫錯了。</p>
<p>（D）汽車的聲音，聽錯是飛機的聲音。（這種情形在中日戰爭時，多數的人都曾犯過）</p>
<p>我相信犯過像這種類似的錯誤（或過失）的人一定很多，看起來這些小過失是不値得注意的，其實這些小過失無論是間接或直接都會影響到一個人的事業和生命，像這種情形（很多同時也很複雜）。在心理學上都上都呌做「過</p>
<p>我們把這些過失分為：（一）舌誤，（二）筆誤，（三）視誤，（四）聽誤，和（五）遺忘和放錯五類。</p>
<p>（一）舌誤—例如：你明知道這個同事或同學的名字，但當你叫他的時候却叫出其他一個人的名字來，本來應該說「甲」：而說出「乙」來……等說出與意念相異的話都是屬於這一類。</p>
<p>（二）領誤—這種情形很普遍，從別人和自己的信中或文章中時常可以看到，有一次我在一位親戚的信上看到：「故父大人……這麽一句，使我驚訝到極點，因為他是個高中的學生，到後來纔知道他平常討厭「尼姑」「三姑六婆」這一種人，他認為「姑」字是不祥的字，但他又說明明是寫「姑」字，怎麽又會變成「故」呢……像（C）等都屬於這一類。</p>
<p>（三）視誤例如在白天認錯了人，或看錯了事物等都屬於這一類。視誤常引起讀誤，但讀誤不一定是起因於視誤如（A）</p>
<p>（四）聽誤—這不能指因相類似的聲聲音而引起的錯誤，應該是指雨種相異的聲音而有人竟以乙代甲所引起的錯誤。例如：軍隊裏的士兵把鳴蟬的聲音聽錯是哨子的聲音，抗戰還沒有結束，我鄰家的一位老伯竟被十輪卡的聲音嚇死，這些類似的情形都是聽誤的結果。</p>
<p>（五）遺忘和放錯——你的剪刀剛沒有離手多久，突然間不見了，但過了某些時無意中又找到了，這也是遺忘和放錯的結果。大家都知道某發明家竟將錶當作鷄蛋放進鍋裏煮的故事。如（A）（B）等都是屬這一類。</p>
<p>那麼；為什麼會有上述的種種情形產生呢？</p>
<p>在這裏我們先要知道我們人都具有意念（意義）的能力，但意念有時現於意識界或隱於潛意識界。它的活動以意識來顯示，或用種種具有「情緒分子」的意念，時殊結合來顯示，此等意念的特殊結合呌做「隱機」（Complexes）或謂「潛意識」（Uncomscious），隱機和意識不相容，又時常衝突，但又常為意識所抑制，不能直接現於意識界中；故此等隱機，常遭遺忘。例如：某人討厭一件事或對於過去曾經作過一件，現在認為可羞恥的事，故目前每想到這事，就感到不安或慚愧，這樣，某人對於這件事的記憶已成為一隱機，而此「隱機」為整個人格所不容，因隱機具有發動力（Dynamogenic）故常與人格（意識）相衝突，如果後者的勢力大於前者的時候—隱機常被抑厭—面即某人「抑制」這可厭或可羞恥的隱機，以避免衝突，使它不能侵入意識範圍內，以求得心理的安靜，結果常發生「遺忘」，造成第（五）類的現象。</p>
<p>但「隱機」所具「能」（Energy）的分量是和情緒的分子的强度成比例。所以當此隱機附有的多量情緒的內容被抑制時就和精神生活中其他事實的聯念分解而離柝，因此這種「能「就不容易發洩，而却時常在謀一發洩的機會，或改變形式向抵抗力最少之途徑呈顯於意識界；或待充分的「能」聚積超過阻力（抑制力）時，則發生爆發或襲擊（Explosion　or　attack）作用。此能一且得到自由，同樣也呈顯於意識界，因此；在醒覺時便發生笑話，過失（如（一）—（五）等情形尤以（一），（二）最普遍），瘋狂……等；在睡眠時就以夢境來顯示（如本刋二十五期拙著「夢」裏所說）</p>
<p>所以有人忘記了或是呌錯了你的名字的時候，那你就要特別地留心了，假使你也呌錯了別久的名字或寫錯了人家的通訊處時，也會引起對方的惡感的……。</p>
<p>上面雖然都是些淺近的舉例，但為的是給讀者一個簡單的概念，使讀者有所心得或知道這些「過失」的主因；减少一點因『過失』而引起的損失。（完），</p>
<p>自由談</p>
<h3>君子自重</h3>
<p>— 平齋</p>
<p>時局到了今天，不可謂不嚴重。在這樣嚴重的局面下召開了行憲的國大，意義更不可謂為不重火。然而，國大開幕迄今，若干代表們表現出來的行為，　實在使我們老百姓痛心萬分，欲哭無淚—先是在會塲中造成了一片「噓！」的世界，甚至凌霄漢閣主人有「開噓之新紀錄」之妙語；繼之又是代表要打大會主席，據二十三日本報載南京電：「大會胡主席（靖安）……本擬聲辯，旣見形勢不佳，乃掙出重圍，向台後右角小門逃避。十數代表由雲南順寗代表曾作大理縣長之張廷勛，及本為退讓簽署代表經奔走後始獲出席之工會李鴻儒等，領先咆哮迫逐，滿台鬧成一團。若千新聞記者詢張姓名，張拒不作答，反將其書有姓名號碼之佩條密藏袋中，並繼績向胡追擊，各記者堅欲紫看佩條，於爭持問將其佩條扯下，始知乃張廷勛，時胡已乘間隱去，張乃轉移目標，對各記者橫眉豎目，幾欲動武……」</p>
<p>而二十四日的報上，又登載着「廣東代表及粵籍華僑代表竟將南京救國日報搗毀，且有數人負傷」的消息！政府每天化了幾十億召開的國大，竟留下了這些遺臭萬年的汚點，而外國記者們更是專電四出，傳為國際間的笑柄—國大代表應當是代表全國老百姓的，今天弄出這些花樣來，我們老百姓實在覺得有些意外，因為我們始終以為這些代表們即使不能全部都彬彬有禮，至少總不會有那種「橫眉豎目」的打手們的—代表們儘管仍舊意氣揚揚，我們老百姓倒代他們覺得羞慚無地了！</p>
<p>論理，民主制度之所以値得贊美，最主要的一個原因就在於能够使少數派也有一個陳述意見的機會。美國的開國元勛傑弗遜曾對其某政敵言：「我堅決反對你的意見；但是我將拚命力爭—使你有發言的機會。「行憲的使命並不輕，每一個代表應當知道這是中國跨上民主之道的一大步，而國大會塲上的一片「噓」聲，就根本上粉碎了「民主」兩個字！至於「咆哮追逐」主席的「英雄」們張廷勛李鴻儒之洗，其狂妄卑劣固不値得汚我的筆墨，但我所要問的是：國大塲中難追竟無別的深明大義的代表—何以竟讓一二害羣之馬這樣建無忌憚的造成了天下的大不韙？何以大會塲中幾位新聞記者義正辭嚴的責備，能使這些「追攻」國民大會主席的暴徒們慴服，而代表們本身竟目覩了這幕醜劇，而祇是袖手旁觀，不贊一辭？你們倒底是「姑息養奸」呢，還是「同洗合汚」？</p>
<p>最近的搗毀救國日報，更是荒謬絕倫，目無法紀！做了國大代表，便可以這樣在國都首善之區，胡亂打人，胡亂犯法的喝？國大代表而行凶打人，就是現行犯，司法當局就該立即予以逮捕，從重處刑，除掉治他們傷害等刑事罪責外，還應該治他們在戡亂期間集衆搗亂後方秩序之罪，籍以稍正國際視聽，稍伸民族正氣！筆者並不認識龔德柏其人，而且對救國日報的言論也一向頗多不能贊同之處，但憲法旣賦人民以言論之自由，那麽負責實行憲法的那些代表們就更應當尊重龔德柏暢所欲言的自由。如果龔德柏的言論有公然誹謗等違反法律的地方，關係人正可堂堂正正的向法院吿訴，要求治龔德柏以應得之罪。為什麼以堂堂國天代表之尊，竟不敢光明磊落的訴之法律，而偏要採取洗氓打手的手段？當然，這些人甘趨下洗，我們也就無話可設，但是我們不得不向奉公守法的大多數代表們呼籲：諸公應知自重，你們不能讓這些少數的害羣之馬繼續玷汚全體代表的名譽，如界今天你們的腦筋裏還有一點點當日選舉你們的老百姓的影子，你們就應當採取行動，分淸涇渭。否則，悠悠之口難防，中外史家之筆是不肯輕饒人的！</p>
<h3>也談婚姻教育</h3>
<p>— 翼君</p>
<p>關於滬江大學下學期擬增設婚姻的科目一件事，已有很多人加以諭列了，而且大家的意見都是一致的贊同，本來不必再談。但筆者係一未婚靑年，馬上就要大學畢業，已屆「今年二十五，衣破無人補」的高齡，深恐「若要有人補，再守二十五」的命運落在自已頭上，那可眞不得了！自己切身的問題，不嫌詞費，也來談談。</p>
<p>首先坦白告訴你。（其實你已知道）平常課餘之暇，男同學們聚在一起，最所津津樂道的，第一是女人，第二是女人，第三還是女人；我想，女同學的課餘消遣或工作，自然是談談男人，論論丈夫了。</p>
<p>消種注意異性的傾向，原是人類的强烈本能，跟飢欲食，渴欲飮是一樣的重要·就學校學生而言，大概小學中高年級時代即已意識到男女性的分別，初中便開始互相愛慕，高中已達乾柴烈火之勢，大學則可為愛人赴湯蹈火，雖死不懼了，追求可以瘋狂，失戀情願自殺、偉大極矣！所以婚姻的意義，豈傳宗接代而已邪？這是生活的一極重要部分，不結婚即缺少生活上一極精彩的節目，即為生活的不完全。</p>
<p>舊式的婚姻，但憑父母之命，媒妁之言，作硬性的配合，無選擇之餘地，碰得好，是運氣，碰得不好，是活該，所幸這樣的時代差不多已過去了。</p>
<p>可是，新式婚姻的成果又如何？婚姻美滿者，固然很多，因而造成悲劇的，也大有人在。某些有情人未能成眷屬，多少結合者不能偕老，以致結了又離，合了復分，婚事的糾紛不絕，家庭的悲劇常演，這都是亟待解決的問題。更擴而言之，欲治其國者，必先齊其家，夫婦不和，家何以齊？所以這是關係個人禍福，和國家民族興衰的一個大問題。大學中列為課程，訂為科目，以指導靑年男女如何追求適宜的對象，建立美滿的家庭，避免生活的悲劇，事受甜蜜的　情，眞是萬分必要！選修同學之必然踴躍，而且考試成績在八十分以上，可斷言也。</p>
<h3>加斯貝里</h3>
<p>— 道先</p>
<p>義大利總理加斯貝里，戰前因為領導基敎民主黨兩度被墨索里尼下獄，後來洗亡到梵諦岡，當一名圖書館管理員，月薪八十元。為了彌補收入的不足，他敎授外國語，及替外國記者捉刀寫通訊。</p>
<p>戰時，他和友人潛返義大利，組織遊擊除，對抗納粹。在一九四六年的大選中，出乎他自己的意外，基督敎民主黨竟獲八百萬票，而為義大利的第一大黨。這次大選，加斯貝里又獲優勝，但，心情是緊一張得多了。</p>
<p>加斯貝里生活　單樸素，住在一個小公寓中，傢具還是他在梵諦岡當岡書館管理員時，分期付款買來的那一套。他睡的是一張小硬木床。白牆上的僅有裝飾，是十字架和聖母像。</p>
<p>他在任總理之初，第一件事，是預支薪水，去買一套藍色的新衣服。貝氏極節儉，常把不需要的電燈關上。他的決人是一位農家婧，為他生了四個女兒，其中有一個嫁給米關的一位屠夫，還有一個當了女尼。</p>
<p>加斯貝　最敬佩的是專家，團結在他四周的，有許多幹才，帮助他對抗義共。有人說，加斯　在今日歐洲最　的成就，是他不靠共產黨的「帮助」治理國事。</p>
<h3>馬泳齊</h3>
<p>— 錢大成</p>
<p>至常熟遊虞山者，皆知有王四酒家，亦莫不知有馬泳齋。馬泳齋者，一熟肉舖也。上海蘇州皆有分店，故尤馳名遠近。此店主人馬姓，創始於淸季，其家舊居東鄉古里村，家道小康，有田數頃。常熟人素重口腹之慾，其家尤甚，竟以老鑒盡喪其家資。然烹調之術，由是而益精。迨飢寒驅迫，遂以肴羞置入考籃，（足徵彼亦士人）兜售於茶坊酒肆，（今蘇州破落戶業是者亦衆）衆嘗其味而大好之，稱其紅燒肉曰「馬肉」，紅燒鷄日「馬鷄」，非其手製不足壓其口慾。而鷄肉鬆及爊鷄尤其拿手傑作也。（更有靑魚鬆味至精妙，今不復有矣。）所謂爊者，先設一鍋，中置菜油醬油若干斤，及茴香等燃料，（燃料藥材有定方）將油熬熟，而後以白熟鷄置入鍋中一夜，其味鮮美絕倫，其色亦黃嫩可愛。豬肉鷄鴨蛋豆腐乾等，亦可置入；此鍋愈陳則愈妙。「漢書注」以　羊炙肉即今之所謂爊，實臆測之詞，不足信也。馬姓不數年而重振其家業，遂設馬泳齋於憲日寺前，門面極狹窄，數十年如一日，未嘗改變。然其生涯鼎盛，邑人出門饋送土產，外來人士欲嘗虞山名產者，羣趨此店。他家雖竭力效法，衡宇相對，若龍泳齋鳯泳齊相繼興起，與之爭長，終望塵莫及。每年所殺鷄鴨，輒以萬計。然其味終以常熟本店為最雋妙；蘇滬分店則不無迎合其地人士之口味，失其本眞。然其家食而知味，獗而復起，竟成素封，抑亦貨殖之雄者已！</p>
<h3>小雨點</h3>
<p>— 施濟美</p>
<p>信心，愛心，恒心是思想之樹的空氣，陽光；　水。</p>
<p>美麗的桃花，被人採下，插在瓶裏欣賞，點綴暖室裏的春天，沒有幾天，枯了，萎了，……再美麗的生命也完了。</p>
<p>不好看的花，沒有人注意和欣賞，在樹上結成了桃子。</p>
<p>『天上一日，人間千年。」—這是「時間市塲」的官價掛牌。人間的日子越來越不好過了，如今，不知該用多少億萬個春秋，才能換得天上的一個晨昏？</p>
<p>時間這樣　西，一小時比一天長，一天比一年長，一年又比一生長，……</p>
<p>我們能將幾十年沒有人跡的古屋收拾得一塵不染，但是，誰又能够拭去記憶裏的塵埃呢？即使那記憶還是昨宵夢魂中的，即使那塵埃只不過一星半點。</p>
<h3>談硯</h3>
<p>— 半夢</p>
<p>古來談硯者衆矣，李之彥有硯譜，米南宮有硯史，曹繼善有硯說，遜淸時代，施愚山有硯林拾遺，計壽喬有端溪硯坑考。硯說頗多，不勝枚舉，端出固甚佳，歙出亦有良者，未可執一而論。</p>
<p>端硯始於唐武德之世，至五代宋初，發見端溪下巖南北兩壁，北浸泉水內，南則半浸，北石潤澤，略勝於南。自治平迄宣和，取石愈多，壁皆　為洞，於是有上巖中巖下巖之異，東洞正洞西洞之分。元時禁閉之，明永樂宣德間，開閉無常，崇禎末年，熊文燦復開一坑，所得石，駕宋坑上。遜淸時，各坑不禁，取石更多，然佳石絕少，洗傳於世而有名者，均係舊物，大都以能發墨能脫墨者為上品也。</p>
<p>藏硯之人，視石之出產地而分別其色澤之良否。龍巖將軍坑，下巖舊坑，水巖舊坑等，皆有佳石。永樂中，以水嚴西洞石為細潤發墨，取之者不職，洞遂鑒穿。水巖石無紫赤如猪肝者。紫中微帶淡白淺靑之色，其紫處中濃外淡，或圓如錢，或散成片，俗謂之火捺。淡白處如烟如雲，亳無定形者，俗謂之蕉白。又有靑花黃龍等紋者，總以石質膩滑淸潤，撫不留手，可以暗中摸索而得為佳。</p>
<p>關於硯眼，尤須辨其死話。眼不活，則混雜蕪光采。活眼黑白明潤，有八九重暈，瞭然瞳子，龍在硯之眉額間流盼如水者，尤有趣。若梅花坑石，通體皆豆瓣眼者，亦不易得。石雖端，而新之不佳，琢為龍虎風雲三台獨柱人物山水等等工細象形，俗惡而失雅觀，亦不稱石質之佳美，收藏家尤不取之。一</p>
<p>至於靑花，若組點叢雜，便非貴品。惟浮沉石面，零星隱現，諦視之，如髮絲鼠跡蠅翅等，間錯威文，或如澗沚細藻浮動，或如魚隊游泳水中，或如秋雲棉密，或如水面微塵，皆為上品。石紋分別尤多，如火捺，金錢，鐵捺，鳯涎，翡翠，王帶，黃龍，金綫，鷓鴣斑，硃砂斑，古斑等，種種不同，辨審良難，非精於此道者，不能條分縷晰也。</p>
<p>硯之佳者，不第端溪，宋人刷絲羅絞硯，即係歙州棗心坑石，色異而製美，亦古所　稱。余友儲簡翁，曾藏有東坡先生大圓硯，直徑約二尺，刻有東坡手書頗多，其石非端溪，似係歙出，寇亂以後，未知尙存否。我輩用硯，以能發墨為第一，表面花紋如何，是藏硯家所有事，可以不問。至於名人手跋，良工雕琢，雖極精美，與耕種硯田者無關。近日凌霄漢閣主人得古硯一方，邊跋書法蒼勁，不知係何代物，尙在考訂中也。施叙範</p>
<h3>遙祭茲親</h3>
<p>— 施叔範</p>
<p>生前命苦不曾歡，死後猶難入土安，老眼臨終兒未送，繁霜浮厝骨長寒；兩周歲月吞聲記，一慟幽冥扶夢看，母子恩情何世續？紙灰燒海海應乾。</p>
<p>流亡骨肉乞慈憐，薄薄麻衣未得穿，自共乳烏啼歲尾，料無臘粥供靈前，闔棺定積思兒淚，乘月便當上塚船，凄絕此心　鼓裏，望中歸祭是何年？</p>
<p>生子如吾死不瞑，殯宮未掃尙浮萍，三年無母終疑夢，一繳供香可有靈！屠狗寗忘當日誓，呵冰怎洗故山腥？租刀買馬貧難補，敢說歸旌墓上銘。</p>
<p>兒力雖殫血尙紅，兒心極苦為微忠，原知不葬通天罪，已到賣文刻骨窮！子弟三呼終識我，江洗萬折必歸東，春前祭吿殘冬雪，先著麻衣拜雪中。孺子</p>
<h3>蘇格接底的小屋</h3>
<p>— 孺子</p>
<p>希臘大哲學家蘇格拉底，有一次築了一所狹小的房子，大家都覺得非常奇怪。他的鄰人就問他道：</p>
<p>「先生名滿天下，為什麼倒築了一間鴿棚似的小房子來住呢？」</p>
<p>蘇格拉底說：「這也許沒有什麽理由。但是這屋子雖小，要是我能使良朋好友坐滿，我也就很快樂了。」</p>
<p>—朋友滿天下，知心能幾人？</p>
<h3>談鷄尾酒會</h3>
<p>— 寄漠</p>
<p>美國的鷄尾酒會，本來是幾位知友在餐前的小叙，現在却成為宣傳一位新影星，推銷某種化妝品或某一型新汽車等必不可缺的一種儀式了。</p>
<p>在紐約成百萬的居民中，經常出席鷄尾酒會的，也許只有數千人，而這數千人中，有的每天要參加一二個酒會，其中包括專欄作家，美容及時裝雜誌編輯和新聞記者等。</p>
<p>紐約市中比較重要的鷄尾酒會，均有一定的用意，例如介紹到紐約來的、影星，介紹上映的新影片，新製的時裝，以及出版的新書等。這些酒會的規模，大小不一，少則借用旅館內的一個小房間，到會者五六十人，多則租用寬大豪華的跳　塲，參加者也許有數百人之多。</p>
<p>鷄尾酒會的情形，大致相仿。三五人集在一起談話，壓低着喉嚨，表示他們的彬彬有禮。進食的時候，也淺嚐即止，與上餐館儘量大嚼者不同。</p>
<p>鷄尾酒會也有幾項規則。其中之一，便是儘可能避免與應邀赴會的貴賓晤談。有些慣常參加酒會的人，若干年來，始終沒有和那些貴賓交談過。</p>
<p>文藝性的鷄尾酒會，頗受人重視。與會的紳士淑女，執着茶杯，談笑風生，雋語疊出，參加者有出版商，作家和一般鷄尾酒會中常見的客人。他們　着鷄尾酒，互道家常的瑣事。</p>
<p>現在差不多美國每一行商業的負責人都已發現舉辦鷄尾酒會是聯絡感情和對外宣傳的絕妙手腕。有的是介紹廚房設備，電汽冰箱或珠寳首飾等各式各樣的酒會。至於介紹時裝和美容品的酒會，更天天舉行。工業設計家也在酒會中陳列雕型的產品，配合着音樂和專家的說明，闡述產品的特性和優點</p>
<p>鷄尾酒會的開支，往往使許多人望而却步。在大半的情形下，旅館的房間，免費供給，主人祇須付出酒及食物等費用。至於每星期約舉行二十次酒會的華爾道孚飯店，及每天有二三次鷄尾酒「派對」的施道克及聖里奇飯店，其收賣標準視主人愛好舖張的程度及客人消耗的多寡而不同。</p>
<p>鷄尾酒每杯取費美金五角五分至八角八分不等。三明治及點心每份取費一元至一元五角。花去五元可以吃到放在活動玻璃櫃內的火鷄，火腿，或基他熱菜。</p>
<p>舉行一次鷄尾酒會，平均每客須花去三元或三元以上。不久以前，從加里福尼亞來的某甲在華爾道孚飯店訂期宴客，他堅持要某某等著名歌星唱歌，計花去三千元。他又定購各種花卉，花去二千元。他在酒會中分設香檳酒櫃及混合酒櫃二種。貴客席中，另外供應昂貴的魚子醬。此次他宴請一百參位朋友，共花去一萬元。普通的酒會，則花去一千元也够了。</p>
<p>總之，鷄尾酒時間是介於辦公時間及進餐時間的有趣的插曲，頗與英國的喝茶時間相仿。它是道地的美國社會習尙的產物。有人說它適應美國工商業需要，應運而生；但是，也有人說，這是美國人患的一種「時電病」。</p>

<h3>Vice Presidential Election Experiences Twists and Turns, National Assembly Adjourns for Persuasion, Chairman Expresses Respect for the Assembly's Opinion</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 25th] The Presidium of the National Assembly held its 36th meeting on the evening of the 25th to discuss the issue of Cheng Qian, Li Zongren, and Sun Ke expressing their intention to withdraw from the vice presidential election. Chairman Hu Shih first had Secretary-General Hong Lanyou report the receipt of the declarations of withdrawal from the election by Cheng, Li, and Sun. Then, they discussed whether to accept the withdrawals. After more than two hours of deliberation, it was generally agreed that the Presidium did not have the authority to accept them. It was resolved to continue persuading Cheng Qian, Li Zongren, and Sun Ke to continue in the election. Hu Shih, Yu Bin, Zeng Baosun, Chen Qitian, Sun Yaofu, and five others were designated to carry out the persuasion work, with plans to visit Li Zongren, Sun Ke, and Cheng Qian on the morning of the 26th to urge them to withdraw their declarations of withdrawal. It was also decided that the Assembly would adjourn for one day on the 26th to facilitate off-site consultations so that the vice president could be smoothly elected as soon as possible, which would benefit the progress of the Assembly. The Presidium is scheduled to meet again at 4 p.m. on the 26th to study the results of the persuasion of Cheng, Li, and Sun by Hu, Yu, and the other four, and then decide on the agenda of the Assembly on the 27th. Furthermore, when the Presidium held its meeting on the evening of the 25th, Wang Chonghui and Bai Chongxi, after persuading Cheng, Li, and Sun, arrived at the meeting at 10:30 p.m. to report on the process of Zhang Qun, Zhang Lisheng, Chen Bulei, and Zhang Zhiben, under the orders of the Central Executive Committee, persuading Cheng, Li, and Sun to continue in the election. According to Bai and Wang's report, both Sun and Cheng stated that their declarations of withdrawal had been sent to the Presidium to await the decision of the Assembly and that they did not intend to withdraw them. However, before the Assembly made a decision, they could refrain from making further declarations of withdrawal in order to accept the persuasion from all parties. Li Zongren, on the other hand, expressed a firm attitude, insisting on withdrawing from the election, and further persuasion was needed. Li also stated that he did not intend to withdraw his declaration of withdrawal.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 25th] The Central Executive Committee of the Kuomintang held an extraordinary meeting at 4 p.m. on the 25th. The attending members of the Standing Committee of the Central Executive and Supervisory Committees included Ju Zheng, Li Wenfan, Wu Zhongxin, Wu Jingheng, Wang Chonghui, Shao Lizi, and fifty others. President Chiang personally presided over the meeting. First, President Chiang explained that the three comrades Cheng Qian, Li Zongren, and Sun Ke, candidates for vice president, had successively declared their withdrawal from the election. He asked the members to discuss what decision the party should make on this issue. Subsequently, the members spoke one after another. After an hour and a half of discussion, President Chiang summarized the opinions of the members and gave the following instructions: (1) The National Assembly's election of the vice president in this session is being conducted in accordance with the Election and Recall Law. The party can only respect the public opinion of the Assembly representatives and should not make any other decisions. (2) The legal interpretation of the declarations of withdrawal from the election by Cheng, Li, and Sun should also be made by the Presidium of the Assembly and submitted to the Assembly. (3) In order to dispel misunderstandings among party comrades and promote unity, it is hoped that the candidates will immediately cease campaigning. Wang Chonghui, Zhang Qun, Bai Chongxi, Zhang Zhiben, Chen Bulei, and Zhang Lisheng were designated to be responsible for this task.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 25th] After Sun Ke, one of the candidates for vice president, withdrew from the vice presidential election on the morning of the 25th, President Chiang summoned Sun at 12 o'clock to inquire about his withdrawal. The conversation lasted for an hour before Sun left.</p>
<h3>Cheng Qian, Li Zongren, and Sun Ke All Announce Withdrawal from the Election, Clarifying Rumors and Setting a Democratic Example</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 25th] The vice presidential election has taken a sudden turn. The three candidates with the most votes have successively announced their withdrawal from the election. Cheng Qian, who received the fewest votes in the second vice presidential election of the National Assembly, had an audience with President Chiang on the afternoon of the 24th. That evening at 8 p.m., Cheng hosted his campaign team at the Central Hotel, stating that he would declare to the Presidium of the National Assembly that he was withdrawing his candidacy for vice president. At 2 a.m. on the 25th, Li Zongren also decided to withdraw from the election. His campaign committee issued a notice of withdrawal to the Xinmin Bao that night, stating that someone was distributing leaflets openly attacking Li. In order to express his upright and forthright attitude, Li had declared to the Presidium of the National Assembly that he was withdrawing from the vice presidential election. After learning that Cheng and Li had successively withdrawn from the election on the morning of the 25th, Sun Ke, another candidate, also immediately decided to declare to the Presidium of the National Assembly that he was withdrawing his candidacy. After this news was confirmed at noon on the 25th, the Jing Central Daily issued a special edition at 1:30 p.m., which, in addition to publishing the above news, also contained a "report from this newspaper," stating: "Sun Ke's decision to withdraw from the election is to clarify rumors, dispel misunderstandings, promote unity, and set a good democratic example." The Central Daily reporter also added a note, saying: "The Kuomintang has a majority of seats in the National Assembly, but no decision was made on the candidate for president before the general election. The Central Provisional Plenary Session has allowed Sun, Yu, Li, and Cheng to compete freely. The party has never manipulated votes in any name. Therefore, in the vice presidential election of the National Assembly, no one was able to exceed half of the total number of representatives in the two rounds of voting. The activities of the representatives inside and outside the venue were very enthusiastic, fully demonstrating the spirit of democracy and freedom. Unfortunately, some newspapers have made mutually attacking remarks and news, which has led to a surge of rumors. The most likely to cause misunderstandings is the notice of the Nanjing Traffic Service Agency published in the Xinmin Bao on the 23rd of this month, which stated: 'Some people believe that President Chiang and Mr. Li once had disagreements due to political differences, and it is inevitable that they are psychologically incompatible. President Chiang is therefore unwilling to support Mr. Li.' It also stated that 'a powerful figure in the Kuomintang wants to use the full power of the party to make a certain person succeed in the election,' and pointed out that the powerful figure is Mr. Chen Lifu. There is also a paragraph that says 'President Chiang should use his international reputation to visit Europe from time to time in order to enhance international understanding of us. If Mr. Li can be elected, he will be more than competent to stabilize the situation, and he will also be qualified to deal with foreign affairs.' This kind of naive propaganda could have been dismissed with a laugh, but unexpectedly, it caused rumors among the National Assembly representatives and the general public. Among the spread of various rumors, the mutual attacks of newspapers and leaflets caused misunderstandings among the candidates. Therefore, Sun Ke, following Cheng and Li, also declared his withdrawal from the election, and all rumors and misunderstandings can be clarified."</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 25th] The vice presidential election has encountered obstacles when it came to the third meeting. The third vice presidential election assembly, which was scheduled to take place on the morning of the 25th, was temporarily decided to be suspended. At 9 a.m. on the 25th, the representatives still went to the National Assembly Hall for a meeting. However, some representatives did not sign in. At 9:50 a.m., Secretary-General Hong Lanyou reported that 1,875 representatives had signed in, but the number of people present was actually more than this. When Hong reported, some representatives stood up and made a lot of noise. His report was interrupted several times by the noise in the venue. Li Wenfan, the chairman of the assembly today, reported a temporary motion from 332 representatives, including Representative Li Hongyi, which stated: "This assembly has been holding elections for days, and the representatives are mentally exhausted. Today happens to be a Sunday, and it is proposed that the assembly take a day off and conduct a runoff election next Monday. The election is a major national event, and it is hoped that it can be carried out in a calm and solemn manner. It is proposed to take a day off and submit the proposal to the assembly for discussion." After the chairman consulted the assembly and there was no objection, he announced the adjournment of the meeting, and the representatives left the venue amidst the noise.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 25th] Cheng Qian, a candidate for vice president, held a tea party at the Peacock Restaurant of the Central Hotel at 8 p.m. on the 24th, inviting the National Assembly representatives who supported his election and the heads of the campaign committee. He expressed on the spot that, in accordance with the principle of humility and self-restraint, he would give up his right to be elected as vice president, and expressed his gratitude to those who supported his election. Cheng then issued a written statement, the original text of which is as follows:</p>
<p>"I originally participated in the vice presidential election, hoping to work for democratic constitutionalism. I am immensely grateful to the representatives for appreciating my humble sincerity and giving me their support. Now that there have been two rounds of voting and no one has been elected, and the candidates are all comrades of our party, I would be happy no matter who is elected. Unity is of utmost importance to the country, which is facing many difficulties, and harmony is the foundation of unity, and self-restraint is the essence of democracy. Therefore, based on this principle, I give up my right to be elected. I respectfully ask the representatives who love me to choose another candidate among the remaining two who is closer to their ideals and cast their sacred vote. I only hope that the vice president will be elected early, the assembly will close successfully, and the new government will be established as soon as possible, so that the people can have a day of rest. My personal advancement or retreat is not worth mentioning, and I will never forget the friendship of my friends."</p>
<p>[Another Telegram] Li Zongren, one of the candidates for vice president, suddenly announced on the 25th, following the lead of another candidate, Cheng Qian, that he was withdrawing from the election. In his letter to the Presidium of the National Assembly, Li stated that his motivation for participating in this election was to serve the party and the country, and that personal gains and losses were not a consideration. In view of the election situation in recent days, "the election has lost its meaning," he hereby formally declared his withdrawal from the election.</p>
<p>[Another Telegram] According to the Sun Ke Vice Presidential Campaign Committee, "In order to eliminate external rumors and strengthen unity, Vice President Sun declared on the morning of the 25th that he would voluntarily withdraw from the vice presidential election and await the decision of the Kuomintang."</p>
<h3>The Democratic Socialist Party Will Express Its Position</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 25th] The National Assembly was obstructed due to the vice presidential election, resulting in events such as adjournment. The Democratic Socialist Party will issue a statement on its attitude towards this matter at noon on the 26th. In addition, the party leader Zhang Junmai has arrived in Beijing. It is reported that the party opposes the increase in the number of legislators passed by the State Council on the 22nd. It has sent a letter to President Chiang, explaining the reasons for its disagreement, but has not yet received a reply.</p>
<h3>Taiwanese People's Organizations Issue Statement Demanding the Truth About "Autonomy," Promoting National Prosperity and Not Separating from the Motherland</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Taipei, 25th] After the Taiwanese National Assembly representatives submitted a proposal to the National Assembly requesting the implementation of local autonomy, there have been various rumors circulating outside. Newspapers have even used large headlines saying "Taiwan Demands Self-Government." Now, in order to avoid misunderstandings at home and abroad, various people's and cultural organizations in Taiwan Province have issued the following statement: Autonomy is by no means separation. We are demanding autonomy based on the Constitution. This is not the autonomy that Taiwan sought from the United States and the United Kingdom before independence, nor is it the autonomy that Taiwan sought from the Japanese during the Japanese rule, because the people of Taiwan are of the Chinese nation, and the land of Taiwan is the territory of the Republic of China. We are the masters of the country, not the people of a colony, this is the first point; Our so-called "autonomy" is local autonomy, it is true democratic politics, and it is absolutely not allowed for a few ambitious people to take this opportunity to become officials and make a fortune, this is the second point; Taiwan's role as a demonstration zone for the implementation of autonomy is to promote the realization of local autonomy throughout the country, so its purpose is to actively participate in national politics and contribute all of Taiwan's strength to achieve national prosperity, strength, and happiness, rather than to separate from the motherland, this is the third point. The above is the common will of all the people and cultural organizations in Taiwan, and it is also the true motivation for proposing the implementation of local autonomy in Taiwan Province. It must be used to inform people at home and abroad.</p>
<h3>Certificates to Be Issued Today to Elected National Assembly Representatives</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 25th] The issue of issuing certificates to the signed representatives was decided on the 25th after consultations between Chen Lifu and Zhang Lisheng. The certificates will be issued by the Election Headquarters at 11 a.m. on the 26th. If the certificates are not printed in time, a temporary proof of document will be issued first. After the signed representatives receive the election certificate, it was originally stipulated that they should write a letter of resignation. Now it has been decided that it is no longer necessary to use the word "resignation." Instead, the signed representatives only need to write a statement that they will not attend this National Assembly. The statement should state that they have been legally elected with the most votes and that they are following the repeated exhortations of the President and the explanations of Mr. Yu Bin and Mr. Wang Yunwu of the National Assembly Presidium, that the election certificate is issued in accordance with the election results, and that due to factual difficulties, they are willing not to attend the first National Assembly. The party will allow them to replace the certificate with a new certificate when the supplementary elections for occupational and women's groups are held in the future. Otherwise, they will attend the next National Assembly with the original certificate, and the party will find other ways to deal with the friendly parties in the same region.</p>

<p>[Our Hankou Dispatch on the 25th] Part of the 11th Column of the Communist bandits and four regiments of Zhang Jian's Independent Brigade attacked Jingshan in separate directions starting on the 22nd. After the National Army met the main force of the bandit army head-on in the southeast of the county seat and inflicted heavy blows, the bandits suffered more than a thousand casualties and continued to attack in full force. Subsequently, another unit of the National Army rushed from the south to attack them from both sides, and the air force also dispatched planes to assist in the battle. The bandits were unable to resist and fled northwest. Jingshan was relieved on the evening of the 24th. The rumor that Jingshan had fallen is unfounded.</p>

<h3>National Assembly Proceedings: Adjournment Suppresses a Potential Crisis</h3>
<p>[Special Report from Our Newspaper] With the Vice-Presidential election reaching a fever pitch, everyone was concerned about who among Li Zongren, Sun Ke, and Cheng Qian would emerge victorious in this fierce competition. However, unexpected complications arose overnight. Adjournment proved to be the most skillful method, suppressing a potential crisis.</p>
<p>The 25th was a Sunday holiday. Citizens of the capital prepared to listen to the Vice-Presidential election broadcast at noon, go on suburban outings in the afternoon, and watch movies in the evening. However, only those directly involved with the National Assembly lacked such leisure and carefree spirit. Early in the morning, news of the Li Zongren campaign's solemn declaration regarding Li's withdrawal from the election shocked those inside and outside the assembly hall. Subsequently, the news of Cheng Qian's withdrawal was also confirmed. Speculation abounded. The military police at the entrance continued to shout to the attending representatives: "Please carry your representative attendance cards." However, the figures of the candidates and their wives were no longer seen in the crowd. After a while, even the Sun Ke campaign broadcasting vehicle fell silent. A somber atmosphere enveloped the inside and outside of the assembly hall.</p>
<p>Time crawled slowly in people's hearts. By 9:30 AM, the assembly hall was packed. Some representatives were discussing animatedly, while others sat quietly, reviewing documents. There was Li Zongren's solemn declaration, Sun Ke's emphasis on civilian politicians and the importance of the Northeast, thank-you notes from both to representatives for their intended support, and propaganda pieces presenting the opposite perspective on the reasons for Cheng Qian's withdrawal. News reporters were even more nervous, running around, surrounding people related to all sides, probing and questioning relentlessly. However, besides knowing that the presidium was meeting backstage to discuss the letters from Li and Cheng regarding their withdrawal from the election, everyone was waiting. Some were waiting to cast their ballots, while others were waiting to see what would happen. Until, at 9:45 AM, applause resounded from the Sichuan representative section in the back of the assembly hall. It turned out that Yu Youren was passing through there on his way out. After a while, he walked back in amid applause, walking to his seat in the front row. The applause grew louder and louder, and finally, the entire hall cheered. Yu Youren nodded and thanked everyone, while repeatedly waving his hands to ask everyone to be quiet. Under the mercury lights, his face was flushed with excitement, and his silver beard was particularly striking. His eyes contained a moist, grateful glow. He was speechless. The applause and cheers lasted for a full minute. The topic of conversation in the assembly hall shifted to Yu Youren. Everyone was saying, "The Elder's demeanor is unmatched. Even the victor would find it difficult to achieve such glory." Ten minutes later, a Xinjiang representative said, "Why is it only today that everyone recognizes Mr. Yu's demeanor!"</p>
<p>At 9:50 AM, the chairman of the assembly, Li Wenfan, had just taken his seat when shouts began to erupt from upstairs and downstairs. Although amidst the chaos, no one could hear clearly what they were shouting. Judging from the location, it was clearly representatives from the North, Central China, and the Southwest who were opposing Li Zongren and Cheng Qian's withdrawal from the election. With great difficulty, Hong Liyou managed to get the tally and reported the number of attendees: he said, "...1,875 representatives have signed in, but the number of people in the assembly hall is definitely more than that. There must be many representatives who attended but did not sign in." Following that, Chairman Li asked Secretary-General Hong to read out the temporary motion from Li Hongyi of Henan and 352 others, saying that the election had been going on for two days, and everyone was exhausted due to the tension. The 25th was also Sunday, so they should take a break. This motion was immediately passed without objection. The chairman said repeatedly, "Today's session is adjourned. Adjourned. Adjourned."</p>
<p>This temporary motion temporarily solved many difficult problems, answered many doubts, diluted some dangerous situations, and even saved the lives of many patients with heart disease. The representatives dispersed. Some went to Yanzi Rock to see the Yangtze River flowing eastward, admiring the imperial stele where Emperor Qianlong expressed his love for the people. Some went to the Martyrs' Shrine and Linggu Temple to commemorate the martyrs, silently appreciating the lingering spring. Some participated in the Red Cross Garden Party at Xuanwu Lake, boating and eating cherries. Some watched movies, strolled along the streets, and passed the holiday. However, the vast majority continued to gather nervously to discuss solutions and await news.</p>
<p>The whole story is this: Cheng Qian's vote count lagged far behind in the re-election on the 24th. Afterwards, in order to expedite the results of the election and out of friendship with the competitors, he declared his withdrawal from the election to the presidium that evening. After the adjournment on the 25th, he and his campaign staff told visiting reporters: "The withdrawal from the election was entirely voluntary. Since one's virtue and ability are lacking, it is natural to know when to retreat." Li Zongren was the top vote-getter in both elections and had a clear lead, but at 3:00 AM on the 25th, the Xinmin Daily suddenly received his campaign's solemn declaration ad. It stated that because someone had recently been distributing leaflets, publicly attacking him, saying that "if he is elected Vice-President, he will force the palace, or force the leader to go abroad in three months." To protest this "slanderous and insulting" attack, he decided to withdraw from the election, "to show his upright attitude." However, in his formal statement sent to the presidium of the assembly on the morning of the 25th, he said: "Recently, I suddenly discovered that someone is using the name of the party to oppress and control, so that the representatives are unable to exercise their right to vote freely," believing that "the election has lost its meaning." After the recess on the 25th, reporters could not find any trace of Li. Mrs. Li did not say a word. This was the root of the uneasy mood before the meeting on the 25th. However, the presidium's decision at the emergency meeting was that there was no legal basis for declaring withdrawal during the election process, and the presidium had no right to accept it. At 10:30 AM, Mrs. Sun Ke appeared in the empty assembly hall. An hour later, Sun Ke's voluntary withdrawal statement was also sent to the presidium office. His campaign's statement said that this was to clear up outside rumors and that everything would be decided by the Kuomintang. What was presented to people at noon on the 25th was a cold scene, so cold that it almost stopped people from breathing.</p>
<p>In the afternoon, the Kuomintang Central Standing Committee held an emergency meeting. Until the evening, it decided to maintain the principle of free elections. The Kuomintang Central Standing Committee and the presidium of the assembly both put forward people of high moral standing and reputation to resolve the deadlock. Furthermore, the presidium also decided to adjourn the session for another day on the 26th, so that this important effort would have sufficient time to proceed. The adjournment on the 25th suppressed the potential crisis, and the adjournment on the 26th might reverse a losing game. (April 25, Nanjing)</p>

<h3>Editorial: The Status of Professors Amidst Student Protests</h3>
<p>In the past month, student protests have broken out in many universities in our country. The causes vary, but the common action they exhibit is boycotting classes. The situation is complex, and rumors are difficult to verify. It is not easy for us to provide a comprehensive and accurate discussion here. However, considering that higher education is related to the nation's future, we cannot help but say a few words on this matter.</p>
<p>During this eventful and turbulent period, especially amidst the emotional intensity of current student protests, it is difficult for us to expect young people to calmly examine the situation, express the will of the majority, or heed the advice of society. However, we are most concerned about the loss of valuable studies for these university students. We believe that those who care most about the students' studies are, of course, their parents, followed by the professors who personally teach them. And parents still rely on professors to calm the student protests and guide their children.</p>
<p>In many school strike waves in Europe and America in recent years, we cannot deny that the majority of professors often adopt a laissez-faire, wait-and-see attitude. In theory, they do not agree with the means of boycotting classes, but they have not had the collective power to stop them. Some even seem to regard themselves as outsiders, thinking that this is an issue between the students and the government. The attitude of waiting and seeing and letting things go reduces the power of parental decisions, discourages the majority of hard-working students from expressing their opinions, and allows the minority who control and manipulate to be even more reckless! We believe that this fact and awareness are, to some extent, influenced by the hardship of life and the antipathy towards the reality of politics. Therefore, we deeply feel that improving the lives of professors, both spiritually and materially, is not only a prerequisite for exerting the moral power of professors in schools, but also a solemn responsibility that the government and society should jointly shoulder. It must be known that university professors are responsible for cultivating talented people who will be the backbone of the next generation of society, and their lives and situations today are even more difficult than during the war. Therefore, in the future, in addition to the already established principle of adjusting salaries according to the index, educational administrative authorities must earnestly take responsibility for the prompt distribution of salaries, the increase of research grants, and the multi-faceted planning of welfare undertakings, and make great efforts to improve the treatment of educational personnel.</p>
<p>The lives of professors must be guaranteed, and the status of professors must be respected. Conditions such as food, clothing, housing, and transportation are life, while studying knowledge, imparting knowledge, or what the ancients called "transmitting the Way and resolving doubts," represent the existence or life of teachers. In the current school system, the main way to carry out this task of imparting knowledge and cultivation is through attending classes. Therefore, the continuation of studies is where the true life of teachers lies, and the act of stopping classes is to despise and even deny the status and existence of professors. Therefore, the arbitrary boycott of classes by students, no matter what reasons they cite, not to mention their responsibility for violating school discipline, is absolutely a disregard, ridicule, and insult to professors. Imagine how embarrassing it would be for a learned professor who tirelessly teaches people, carrying books to the classroom, to find that not a single student has come? And suppose that some professors who live far away come and go, trying to find out from student union news whether classes will resume or what kind of "strike" is in place, how pitiful is their status? This is felt most deeply by professors who have personally experienced it in the past two or three years, and we need not say more.</p>
<p>The trivial matters of school administration are generally disliked by professors because they are dedicated to teaching. Even in matters of student guidance, such as serving as a tutor, professors are often unwilling to be distracted. This is the norm in colleges and above. However, now, towards the act of boycotting classes, which threatens the very survival of professors, professors can no longer stand idly by for the sake of themselves and others. The basic mission of a university is to cultivate reason and develop specialized talents. Although boycotting classes does not necessarily go hand in hand with violence, it is at least contrary to "appealing to reason." This passive approach only destroys students' own studies and denies the status of professors, while also stifling the function of education. Especially in recent years, it has been used so lightly that it has lost its function of warning, only losing social sympathy, and is actually equivalent to suicide. Young people who are full of vigor may have their reason obscured, but with the wisdom of professors and scholars and their concern for students, how can they not see this very clearly? Learning from the past to avoid future mistakes, intentional professors should not be willing to continue to stand by and let students act rashly, destroying their own sacred mission.</p>
<p>In the past, someone suggested "more cultivation and less intervention" for university education. Today, the government's attitude towards universities and the universities' attitude towards students can be said to be the extreme of non-interference. In response to the current situation, understanding and demanding with empathy, what we hope that university presidents and professors will devote themselves to is "more responsibility and less laissez-faire." The so-called responsibility, for professors, is not limited to teaching, but first lies in establishing the dignity of education and professors, and jointly seeking a stable environment for teaching. University administrators should be responsible for resolving reasonable demands from students or reporting them to the government for forceful advocacy; those that go beyond reason must be responsible for correcting them. In this regard, professors should assist the principals and use the powers of the school affairs meeting and the professors' meeting to protect the stability of the school and improve the atmosphere. The situation in the world is so serious, and the nation's science is so backward. What must be urgently caught up is university education; this is not a time for laissez-faire and inaction.</p>
<p>I remember that during the war, Chongqing University experienced a wave of rejecting the president. Mr. Zhang Jiluan, the former chief editor of the Ta Kung Pao, gave a passionate commentary on the academic atmosphere, criticizing the university students' misunderstanding of freedom and "the indulgence and complacency of some professors," believing that "the opposition of professors to the government and the connivance and indulgence towards students are harming the country." The meaning of reprimanding in the Spring and Autumn Annals and the heart of an experienced person worrying about the country is truly what is meant by "the speaker is not guilty, and the listener should take warning." In view of the various causes of student protests, educational administrative authorities should of course be responsible for handling them, but boycotting classes actually harms youth education and the national foundation, and professors cannot shirk their responsibility for guiding and preventing them in terms of morality and duty.</p>

<h3>100,000 People in Tumote Banner, Rehe Province, Collectively Attempt to Escape Communist Areas; Unfortunately, They are Attacked by Communists, and Deaths Pile Up Along the Way</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Beiping, 25th] 100,000 men, women, and children in Inner Mongolia, unable to bear the tyranny of the Communists, collectively fled. The Communists relentlessly pursued them, causing numerous deaths. Corpses were piled up along the road. Only 91 people were able to escape the Communist areas and reach Beiping. According to the survivors, five weeks ago, when the Nationalist army withdrew from Fuxin County in Rehe Province, almost all the Mongol and Han residents of the area fled. 20,000 people arrived in Yixian, while the remaining 80,000 were either cut off and driven back by the Communists or scattered along the way. Leading the emigrants were 4,000 Mongol banner soldiers who fought as they marched south for fifty miles, with several thousand killed in action. 70,000 people returned to the Communist Party, where they were either executed or imprisoned for forced labor.</p>
<p>Survivors Recount Communist Tyranny</p>
<p>Wu Ziqing, the judicial team leader of the Fuxin police station in Tumote Banner, said that when they were approaching the outskirts of Yixian and crossing a small bridge, the Communist army fired with machine guns, killing hundreds of people. After a melee, the refugees approached the river, at which time the team suddenly panicked, and only among the Mongols, 400 people drowned. Several thousand Mongols are still trying to reach Yixian, but there is little hope of arriving safely. It is reported that in December 1945, the Communists once occupied Fuxin. In the beginning, the poor people received some small favors, but after the Communist position was consolidated, the people fell into misery. This time, when the Nationalist army withdrew, the residents planned to escape. Under Communist rule, all men over the age of fourteen were forced to join the army, taxes increased daily, requisitions were frequent, and restrictions were extremely strict. Wu Ziqing said that his brother and ten relatives were subjected to torture, and most of them either died or were lost along the way. Refugees said that the most common punishment used by the Communists was to tie the feet of prisoners to horses, drag them through the streets, and call on residents to trample them to death.</p>

<h3>Persuasion Proves Ineffective: Baoding Court Rules for Divorce of a Father and His Two Sons as a Group</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Baoding, 25th] Recently in Baoding, a case occurred involving the divorce of a father and his two sons as a group. Yang Lin, a pseudo-village head in Xiguan, had sons named Yang Qing and Yang Zaisheng who were studying at Baoding Middle School and were not yet twenty years old.

The two young couples had been married for more than half a year, but their relationship was always discordant, and they quarreled day and night. Recently, Ms. Wang and Ms. Zhao filed a lawsuit with the court, accusing their mother-in-law of abuse and their husbands of being young and inexperienced in human affairs, requesting a divorce. At the same time, their mother-in-law also submitted a petition stating that her husband had been detained for two years for being a traitor, and that her daughters-in-law were unfilial and life was difficult, requesting a divorce so that she could remarry. On the 23rd, the court summoned the three couples of old and young to court at the same time. Because their opinions were far apart, persuasion was ineffective, and they were all sentenced to unconditional divorce.</p>

<h3>Representatives of Two Xinjiang National Assembly Members Cause a Scene After Drinking at the Jinghua Grand Theater; Fixtures Damaged</h3>
<p>Settled After Mediation</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 25th] At about 10 PM on the 25th, an amusing incident occurred at the Jinghua Grand Theater. Luo Sang and Dan Tuke, two representatives of the National Assembly from Xinjiang, broke into the manager's office upstairs at the Jinghua after drinking. Due to a language barrier, a conflict arose with the theater staff, and they smashed tables, glass panels, utensils, and other items. The two were extraordinarily strong and were not wearing representative badges, so the theater staff did not know their identities and could not handle them. They locked the two in the room and called the police. When the police arrived, the two suddenly disappeared. After searching everywhere, they were finally found in the theater after the show had ended. However, the two resisted arrest and no one could get close to them. After a long standoff, one person was finally apprehended, but he soon broke free. By 12:30 AM, personnel from the National Assembly Secretariat had heard the news and rushed to the scene. The matter was settled after mediation.</p>

<h3>The Arteries of Railways Inside and Outside the Pass</h3>
<p>—Special Correspondent of this Newspaper Han Qingtao</p>
<p>[This Newspaper Dispatch from Jinzhou, 20th] The Beining Railway is the arterial railway inside and outside the Pass. Since this arterial railway suffered from vascular rupture, it was almost cut off and suffocated due to obstruction and rupture. Fortunately, thousands of skilled workers, like doctors, diligently and patiently treated and repaired it, restoring its current smoothness and vitality!</p>
<p>Two Organizations This arterial railway has two organizations controlling it. The section inside the Pass, between Peiping and Shanhaiguan, belongs to the "Peiping-Tianjin Railway Administration." The section between Shanhaiguan and Shenyang belongs to the "Jinzhou Railway Administration." The section within the jurisdiction of the Peiping-Tianjin Railway Administration, between Peiping and Tianjin, is in good condition, while the section between Tianjin and Shanhaiguan has suffered considerable damage. Outside Shanhaiguan, the scene of devastation is unbearable to witness.</p>
<p>The train departs from Peiping and can run quickly without any obstacles. After passing Tianjin, it is still good at first. As it approaches "Lutai," the traces of destruction gradually appear before the eyes. Several sections between Tangshan and Shanhaiguan are the most tragic. "Shimen," "Zhuzhuang," and "Liushouying" were burned badly. The station buildings and telegraph poles still bear the brutal scene of the communist bandits' fire attacks.</p>
<p>Sitting in the Jinzhou Railway Administration's passenger car, going out of the Pass and heading towards Wanjialing. In this section, the double tracks are still preserved. Then come the stations of "Qiansuo," "Gaoling," "Qianwei," "Huangdi," "Shahousuo," "Baimiaozi," and others. In the past, everyone often saw these strings of place names in newspapers. These are the places that have been most severely damaged.</p>
<p>Remaining Telegraph Poles The telegraph poles along the road were sawn off or burned. The porcelain insulators on the telegraph poles have become fragments. Piles of discarded telegraph poles are piled near the poles. It is said that the communist bandits shattered them one by one. In order to resume traffic as quickly as possible, the railway administration has either continued the remaining pole tops with pole bases, replaced them with thin wooden poles, or directly inserted the remaining longer pole tops into the ground. High and low, crooked and slanted, the wires are finally connected together.</p>
<p>Where there are no station buildings, sheds have been built. Many station masters and station staff work in the open air. They must work hard while guarding against sudden disasters. Some station staff have been kidnapped and then struggled to run back and continue their work. They receive small salaries and work hard to maintain their positions for the sake of transportation.</p>
<p>The destruction of the railway by overturning or burning is repaired immediately if conditions permit. Sometimes it is repaired during the day, and then destroyed again at night. Repair, destroy, destroy, repair. This went on for a long time. Repair finally prevailed over destruction. The spirit of these unsung heroes is admirable, but the reward they receive is cold and meager.</p>
<p>Repairing Bridges Almost none of the bridges is intact. Many collapsed bridges remain, accompanied by derailed locomotives and carriages. The Jinzhou Railway Administration is currently making the greatest efforts to repair bridges of all sizes. The reporter saw that several large bridges have been restored, while some are being poured with cement or erecting iron frames.</p>
<p>There are often signs along the road warning drivers to "stop and start again," reducing the speed to 5 kilometers per hour. This indicates that there are problems with the bridge ahead. The train is very difficult to travel on. If it can get a breather, it may be possible to restore the bridges between Jinzhou and Shanhaiguan to almost the same condition as before before the flood season. As for the rest, such as signals, communications, and station buildings, that will take a long time.</p>
<p>First Repair Temporary Bridges Currently, the Jinzhou-Shenyang section outside the Pass is in the control area of the communist army. Only more than 50 kilometers of the area between Jiyang and Xinmin are open to traffic. The first hurdle facing the Jinzhou Railway Administration is the Daling River Bridge. The upper and lower lines have been shelled twice by the communist bandits, and none of the bridge piers are intact.</p>
<p>If the military expands, temporary bridges must be repaired first. A large number of wooden piles are needed. It is said that the Jinzhou Railway Administration has made preparations. When the railway administration and the military went to inspect, they were shot at by the opposite bank. The communist army often sends mounted sentries to monitor the movements of the National Army and the railway administration in repairing the bridge. However, it will be repaired sooner or later.</p>
<p>Deploying the Bagua Formation The military authorities have made up their minds to protect this lifeline and at the same time open up the entire traffic on the Beining Road. We saw the strict precautions between Tangshan and Shanhaiguan inside the Pass, and at the same time we saw the more thorough precautions in the section outside the Pass. They are all indicating that the communist bandits cannot be allowed to destroy it again.</p>
<p>Look, trenches and fortifications are being dug everywhere in villages, towns, and stations. Near many stations, there are three layers inside and three layers outside of sloping and sharpened wooden stake fences. Inside, there are also trenches, barbed wire, and "deer fences" like plum blossom piles. In addition, there are various types of bunkers above and below ground, connected above and below ground, mother bunkers and child bunkers, forming a bunker group, communicating with each other and closely linked. It is really a Bagua Formation deployed, waiting for the enemy to come!</p>
<p>The employees of the Beining Road are working hard for this transportation lifeline, and the National Army is also deploying a strong firepower network everywhere. It looks like the opened section cannot be allowed to have major problems again, and the military authorities are rushing to make preparations to "open up" the unopened section!</p>

<h3>The Flames of War Spread in Palestine; Jewish Forces Fiercely Attack the City of Jaffa; The Mayor of the City Has Telegraphed Cunningham Asking for British Troops to Intervene; It is Expected That the Arab Forces Will Not Be Able to Hold Out for Long</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Report] London, 25th Broadcast: Arab leaders today agreed to suspend the withdrawal of Arab residents from Haifa. The Jewish side promised to send police to protect them and establish an Arab-Jewish committee to arbitrate disputes.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Tel Aviv, 25th] The Irgun, a Jewish underground group, began a general offensive on the Arab city of Jaffa, adjacent to Tel Aviv, on the morning of the 25th. The Jewish self-defense force, Haganah, stationed at the border between Jaffa and Tel Aviv, stood by and watched. After preparing all night, 3,000 Irgun troops crossed the border into Jaffa at night. Initial reports from the Jewish side stated that the Mensing Police Station and the railway station in Jaffa had been occupied by Irgun troops. Reports from the Arab side in Jaffa acknowledged that the Jewish army was launching unprecedentedly fierce wave-like attacks on the Arab defense lines. The Arab headquarters in Jaffa ordered all residents of the city to remain calm and unite to defend themselves. Jews in Tel Aviv estimated that there were about 10,000 Arab troops available to defend Jaffa, but believed that the Arabs would not be able to hold out for long. British officials in Jerusalem confirmed that the mayor of Jaffa had telegraphed High Commissioner Cunningham, asking for British troops to intervene. Jaffa is a purely Arab city and should belong to the Arab state according to the partition plan. Arab figures in Jerusalem firmly stated that the Arabs would never give up Jaffa and would fight to the last man. Jewish war reports indicated that the Arab defense works in Jaffa were on the verge of collapse and street fighting was expanding. King Abdullah of Jordan issued an emergency declaration in the country's capital, Amman, stating that the Irgun's attack on Jaffa had no strategic justification. He encouraged the Arabs to continue fighting and not to give up, as reinforcements were on the way. At the same time, the situation in Tel Aviv was also unclear. Some houses caught fire and were burning, and the transportation system was in complete chaos.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Jerusalem, 25th] Jewish Agency officials said that the Irgun forces attacking Jaffa were becoming more and more courageous in battle, and the Arab army was fleeing to the suburban villages. It is expected that the Irgun forces will be able to completely occupy Jaffa by dawn on the 26th.</p>
<p>[United Press, Beirut, 24th] Authoritative sources said on the 24th that the Arab League had decided not to send regular troops into Palestine. The Arab League held a series of meetings in Amman this week and decided to place the Arab Liberation Army under the command of King Abdullah of Jordan. The Arab foreign legion under his command will launch attacks with the assistance of non-regular Arab forces from various countries. The reason the Arab League made this decision is that Jordan is the only Arab country not bound by the United Nations, while all other countries are members of the United Nations. The Arab League plans to temporarily occupy part of Palestine with the Arab foreign legion, and will begin action as soon as the British troops withdraw. Abdullah guarantees that the future withdrawal of troops will be decided by the Palestinian people themselves.</p>
<p>[United Press, Jerusalem, 24th] A dispatch from Haifa today said that the Jewish authorities are now planning to prevent 37,000 Arabs from withdrawing, believing that this withdrawal is a political rebellion. They have requested that the Arabs remain in the area to prove that they can live together with the Jews. The Jewish side is willing to cooperate in solving the food supply problem. However, Arab leaders replied, "We cannot be obedient citizens of the conquerors."</p>
<h3>I Deny Negotiating with the United States Regarding Sending Troops to the Holy Land; Britain, the United States, and France Discuss Simplifying the Holy Land Trusteeship Plan</h3>
<p>[United Press, Lake Success, 24th] The Chinese delegation to the United Nations issued a formal statement on the 24th, denying that negotiations had been held in New York to discuss the possibility of sending a Chinese contingent to carry out the trusteeship of Palestine. However, this statement did not deny that such negotiations might have taken place elsewhere. (A spokesman for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Nanjing refused to comment on this report, and observers believe that the negotiations may have taken place elsewhere).</p>
<p>[Reuters, Lake Success, 24th] British, American, and French representatives today discussed a simplified plan for the trusteeship of Palestine, so that it could be quickly adopted by the General Assembly as a transitional measure. The content of the simplified plan is not fundamentally different from the original plan proposed by the United States, only simplifying the procedure for establishing a provisional government in Palestine. Under this plan, the provisional government of Palestine will only have a governor assisted by an administrative committee. The governor has the right to establish other government agencies on his own if necessary, regardless of whether there are provisions in the trusteeship agreement. This simplified plan can be amended in the trusteeship agreement.</p>

<h3>Council of the Western European Union Holds Weekly Meeting; France and the Netherlands Discuss Military Cooperation</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 24th] After holding its first meeting in London today, the permanent body of the Western European Union issued a communique announcing that the meeting had decided that the permanent body should hold a regular meeting once a week, and that extraordinary meetings should be held at any time if necessary. Today's meeting lasted less than an hour and discussed procedural issues. British Under-Secretary of State for War and Chief of Staff of the Ministry of Defense Hollis also attended the meeting.

<h3>Trial of Major Japanese War Criminals Concluded; Xiang Zhe Returns Home</h3>
<p>Will Submit a Report to the Government</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 25th] Xiang Zhejiong, the prosecutor of our country's prosecution office participating in the Far East International Military Tribunal for War Crimes, is scheduled to leave here by plane this evening and return to Shanghai and then to Nanjing, as the process of trying war criminals has come to an end.

<h3>East-West Blocs Compete for Dominance in Europe; A New Struggle Will Begin; Secretary Marshall Meets with the President to Discuss the International Situation</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 25th] Secretary of State Marshall met with President Truman yesterday after returning to Washington from Bogota to review the current international situation. He will travel to his hometown in North Carolina for a short break this weekend.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 25th] Political figures believe that since Italy has joined the Western camp, the struggle between East and West for dominance in Europe will play out the next act in Germany. The Western countries have made significant progress in their political design in Europe. Now it is only waiting for the United States to clearly express its commitment to the efforts to consolidate Western Europe and how it intends to provide concrete support, especially in the military field.</p>
<p>The connection between Washington and the countries of Western Europe is still lacking. Judging from the remarks made by Prime Minister Spaak after returning from the United States, the United States sympathizes with the defense provisions of the Western European pact, but is not yet willing to publicly declare any concrete guarantees for it. It is reported that the United States requested the merger of the three Western German zones at the London Conference, but has not yet obtained the approval of France. France is unwilling for West Germany to join the Western European bloc until the United States can provide security guarantees. As the curtain is about to rise on the next struggle in Europe, the situation is clearly urgent. Marshall's hurried return from Bogota is related to breaking the stalemate in Western Europe itself.</p>
<h3>Three Foreign Ministers Meeting: Possible Convening</h3>
<p>[United Press International, Washington, 24th] Secretary of State Marshall returned here today from Bogotá, hastily ending the "hot war" of the Pan-American Conference, to resume directing the American strategy in the global "anti-Soviet" Cold War. Marshall's return to the capital has led to general speculation that the US authorities will hold a meeting with Western leaders as soon as possible to plan new efforts to curb European communism backed by the Soviet Union. However, it is still unknown whether this meeting will be a gathering of Marshall and Western European figures such as British Foreign Secretary Bevin and French Foreign Minister Bidault, and whether the meeting will proceed along diplomatic lines. It is expected that Marshall himself will review the situation and lay down the course of action for next week.</p>

<h3>Italian Cabinet Prepares for Reorganization: De Gasperi to Consult with Party Leaders; General Labor Confederation Calls for May Day Parade</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Rome, 24th] Political sources say: Prime Minister De Gasperi will begin talks with party leaders on Tuesday to organize a new government. De Gasperi has gone to his country villa in Gondolfo to study the cabinet reorganization issue diligently over the weekend. According to the right-wing Milan Evening Post, De Gasperi will soon resign as leader of the Christian Democratic Party, and a new party leader will be elected when the party holds its next executive committee meeting. However, the Christian Democratic Party headquarters has officially denied this claim, stating that it will not allow De Gasperi to resign as chairman of the party. It is generally expected that the cabinet reorganization will not change the current party composition of the coalition cabinet, but only slightly alter it. In addition, a special ministry will be established to handle the Marshall Plan. The right-wing Social Unity Party supports this proposal and has nominated its leader, Longobardo, for this position. It is also said that the current Deputy Prime Minister and Budget Minister, as well as the Governor of the Bank of Italy, Fenoldi, may withdraw from the cabinet.</p>

Most of the doors and windows of the Osaka City Government Mayor's Office reception room were destroyed, with losses of about 500,000 yen.</p>
<p>Also in Kobe, yesterday morning, about 200 Koreans went to the prefectural government to protest the Japanese government's closure of Korean schools, requesting that the order be rescinded and demanding the release of 73 Koreans arrested by the Kobe Prefectural Government a few days ago. By noon, more and more Koreans gathered, totaling more than 1,500 people. The Kobe Prefectural Government accepted all the demands of the Koreans, immediately released the arrested Koreans, and withdrew the order to close the Korean schools. After achieving their goal, the Koreans left the prefectural government and dispersed in the evening.</p>
<h3>Kobe Declares Martial Law: Large Numbers of Koreans Arrested</h3>

<h3>Epidemics May Spread Rampantly This Summer: Anti-Epidemic Committee Sets Deadline of End of June to Complete 2 Million Vaccinations</h3>
<p>[Our Own Dispatch] Director Rong of the Anti-Epidemic Department of the Ministry of Health once declared that cholera would be a pandemic in China this year. The Municipal Health Bureau also stated that the epidemic situation in the city was slightly reduced last year, but there is a possibility of a large-scale epidemic this year. The reason is that the number of refugees in the city is increasing daily, and the dirt and filth and living together in a chaotic place lead to the easy spread of epidemics. Therefore, this year's summer anti-epidemic work has been started earlier. The 45 teams of the Anti-Epidemic Committee Anti-Epidemic General Team have been dispatched to Zhabei, Yangshupu, and the shantytowns of the South City since the 19th of this month to inject cholera preventive vaccine for the poor, and they can inject about 10,000 people a day. The health offices in each district serve the people and factories, institutions, and organizations in the district. The Anti-Epidemic Committee plans to complete the vaccination of 2 million people by the end of June so that half of the citizens have immune preparation. In this way, even if there is a potential cholera outbreak, the epidemic situation can be easily controlled and will not spread.</p>
<p>DDT Teams Commence Work</p>
<p>The 200 workers recruited by the Anti-Epidemic Committee's DDT spraying team have completed their training. They will officially start work in two teams from this week. One team is stationed north of the Suzhou Creek, and the other is stationed south of the Suzhou Creek. They always have maps on hand, which indicate the locations of cesspools, garbage dumps, and other places in the area, and they go to spray once a week. In addition, the Anti-Epidemic Committee plans to install 50 water taps in the slums this summer to provide water sources. The locations have been determined.</p>

<h3>Finding Barracks for Transient Recruits: Comfort Association Sets Three Principles</h3>
<p>Fang Zhi, the resident chairman of the Shanghai City Reception and Comfort Committee for Troops Suppressing the Rebellion, stated that recently, new recruits have been frequently passing through the city, and there have been cases of occupying small temples and schools in the urban area. In order to maintain social order and promote military-civilian cooperation, he has stipulated that when the original fixed barracks are deemed insufficient and new barracks must be found, the following principles must be followed: (1) All temples must be re-examined and detailed by the Comfort Association, and the number of soldiers stationed in each temple must be specified. The principle is that temples in the urban area should not be used to station troops to avoid any impact. (2) The barracks for troops stationed are to be investigated by the Comfort Association, and the reception office will post signs stating "Temporary Barracks for Transient Troops Suppressing the Rebellion" for identification. (3) Before the construction of the reception center barracks is completed, tents and cots should be set up as much as possible in the open space of the center to reduce the number of people stationed in temples.</p>

<p>[Our Own Dispatch] Cai Longren, the commander of the Ninth Gendarmerie Regiment, and Zhou Zuozhen, the deputy commander, and other officers, who were transferred to Shanghai last month to take over the duties of the Third Independent Battalion of the Gendarmerie, hosted the local press corps at the New Life Club yesterday afternoon at 2:00 PM to report on the regiment's history and work, and to solicit guidance and assistance from local elders and social elites. The Ninth Gendarmerie Regiment was originally the Fourth Supplementary Regiment, established in Nanjing in October 1937, and reorganized into the Ninth Regiment in Ningxiang, Hunan in September 1938. In October of the same year, it went to western Hunan to maintain road safety and suppress bandits. It successively quelled more than a hundred large and small gangs of bandits in the border area of Hunan and Guizhou, as well as more than two thousand anti-conscription bandits instigated by enemy traitors. In October 1940, it moved to the Chuanqian Road area, serving as traffic control and military police. In the autumn of 1941, it was stationed in more than ten counties including Hechuan and Tongliang in northern Sichuan, guarding the capital and assisting in food management. In September 1945, it was ordered to return to the capital first. In the autumn of 1946, it was stationed on the Beijing-Shanghai line. In May 1947, the area of service extended to the Shanghai-Hangzhou and Zhejiang-Jiangxi lines. In March of this year, it was ordered to transfer to Shanghai. Currently, the deployment of troops is as follows: The First Battalion is responsible for duties south of the Suzhou Creek and in Pudong, and the Second Battalion is responsible for duties north of the Suzhou Creek. The 7th and 9th companies of the Third Battalion are stationed in Hangzhou with the regimental headquarters, and the 8th company is stationed in Jinhua and Yiwu, respectively serving as military police in Hangzhou and protecting trains and combating smuggling on the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Road. There is also a directly subordinate special detachment responsible for protecting trains on the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou lines. The communications company is stationed in the city with the regiment and is responsible for communication and liaison between the regimental, battalion, and company levels. In the past month or so, the work situation has been as follows: 112 cases of military personnel violating discipline were dealt with, 25 military-civilian disputes were handled, 2 cases of military-military traffic accidents were handled, 45 cases of military-civilian housing disputes were handled, 17 deserters and stragglers were arrested, and 41 cases of impersonating military personnel, obstructing military service, and forging documents and seals were handled. In the future, the focus of work will be to eliminate deserters and stragglers and prevent problems before they arise.</p>
<h3>Weng Zhong Blessing Brings Trouble: Police Station to Order Relocation</h3>
<p>The Weng Zhong statue at the intersection of Nanjing Road and Xinchang Road, after "becoming human" and winning a charity house raffle, has recently been gilded by the winner of the house raffle. Incense has been strong in recent days, but the New Town Police Station believes that the Weng Zhong statue is located in a key traffic area where pedestrians are bustling. If worship continues day and night, it will actually obstruct the view. It is reported that the police station is preparing to move the Weng Zhong statue to Tongbai Palace on Weihaiwei Road or the King's Temple on Chengdu North Road. The Gordon ship will arrive this morning.</p>

<h3>Election of Bao Chief on Maigen Road: Two Factions Confront Each Other, Refusing to Give Way; More Than a Thousand Voters in a Brawl, More Than Thirty People Injured and Sent to Hospital</h3>
<p>[Our Own Dispatch] Because the 8th Bao in Zhabei District is vast and difficult to manage, the district office was ordered to divide the 8th Bao into the 8th Bao and the 32nd Bao. A major dispute arose over the choice of Bao Chief. According to reports, most of the residents in the district are out-of-town households from Shandong, northern Jiangsu, and Anhui. At about 8:00 AM yesterday, the masses gathered at the Maigen Road Refugee Shelter to vote. The Shandong faction elected Zhou Qi as Bao Chief, and the northern Jiangsu faction elected Dai Jinbiao as Bao Chief. The voters on both sides formed opposing lines. At about 11:00 AM, the Shandong faction, seeing that Zhou Qi had no hope of being elected Bao Chief, prohibited voting for Dai Jinbiao, which aroused dissatisfaction among the masses. After a time of loud noise, a bloody battle broke out. More than a thousand voters fought each other with wooden sticks, bricks, and stones. After receiving a report, the Zhabei Police Branch, led by Branch Chief Zhou Si'an and Section Chief Shi, rushed to the scene in vehicles with dozens of uniformed and plainclothes police officers and a large number of police officers from the Police Corps to suppress the situation. The disturbance gradually subsided. It was reported that more than thirty people were injured on both sides, including Wang Ganwen and Tao Qingkui, who were all taken to the hospital for treatment by the police. As of dusk, the Bao Chief had not yet been elected.</p>
<h3>Coerced Confession? Extortion? Wen Guangting Accuses Police of Frame-Up; District Attorney's Office to Investigate Today</h3>
<p>[Our Report] Wen Guangting, a foundry worker who was accused of theft by the police but acquitted by the court, and who remained in custody for an extended period before being released on bail, previously filed a complaint with the City Council, accusing police officers of extracting confessions through torture and judicial police of soliciting bribes. The president of the District Court, Cha Liangjian, has taken this matter very seriously. He recently transferred Wen's entire case file to the District Attorney's Office for investigation to uncover the truth. This morning, Prosecutor Liang Gengshun will open a hearing, summoning Wen Guangting, bailiff Xu Jingkuan, and Tian Abing, the owner of He Xing Foundry who acted as Wen's guarantor, for questioning.</p>
<p>Wen Guangting Claims He Was Kicked, Beaten, and Waterboarded</p>
<p>Regarding the allegations of police abuse and bailiff bribery, Wen Guangting told a reporter from the Shanghai News Agency yesterday that after his arrest, he was confined to a narrow iron cage. He requested permission to make a phone call to have a friend come and verify his identity, but this was denied. The torture began at 8:00 AM the day after his arrest. During interrogation, he refused to admit to being a thief and was slapped and kicked. He was then tied to a specially made bench about five or six feet long. During waterboarding, his eyes were first covered, then his mouth, and water was poured forcefully into his nose. This happened five or six times at the police station. He recalled that there were about three or four police officers present, one wearing a dark blue Chinese-style suit, and another wearing a blue serge coat. During the waterboarding, he was also whipped with a canvas belt. The theft case was heard four times, but the plaintiff never appeared in court. After being released on bail, his friend, Tian Liangquan, a worker at the De Tai Iron Works, went to the court with the bail bond. Due to unfamiliarity with the procedures and a missing case number (Criminal Special Character No. 99), a bailiff told Tian that if he were willing to offer "cigarette money," he could find a way to locate the number. Tian initially offered 40,000 yuan, which was later increased to 60,000 yuan. During the bail procedure, someone said that if he was willing to pay 200,000 to 300,000 yuan, he could leave immediately. Another matter involved a request for an additional 5 million yuan. Regarding the Hu Xing Foundry's statement that he was fired three days before his arrest, Wen said that he was arrested on January 14th, and the factory paid his wages on the 13th. He believes the factory made this statement to avoid being implicated, fearing potential troubles. It was also learned that Zhu Qiaobin, who claimed to have been robbed of galoshes, a foot basin, and a kerosene stove by Wen Guangting, told reporters yesterday that he had indeed been robbed of these items. He said he was told by someone from the police station that Wen Guangting had confessed to stealing them.</p>
<h3>Yang Jingzhou's Peculiar Words and Actions Before Disappearance; Taiwan Police Department Investigates Passenger Ship; Chief Mate and Passengers Describe What They Saw</h3>
<p>[Report from Taipei, 25th] Regarding the disappearance of Yang Jingzhou, a reporter accompanied Lin Yuanlong, an attaché of the Criminal Investigation Brigade of the Provincial Police Department, and Chen Jiankang of the Criminal Investigation Section, to Keelung today to visit the passenger ship and conduct an on-site investigation. Chief Mate Huang Haobo answered various questions. According to him, Yang purchased a steerage ticket. Due to a severe storm shortly after leaving Keelung, steerage passengers were unable to stay in their cabins, so Yang sat with other passengers in the main dining room. Around 2:00 AM on the 10th, several passengers saw him go outside, but they didn't think much of it. The ship was still sailing in the waters off Taiwan at the time. The next morning, on the 11th, it was discovered that he had not returned, and his bag was found on the dining table. The Chief Mate was notified, and a search was conducted, but he was nowhere to be found. At that time, the ship was sailing in the waters off Zhejiang. Inside the bag were a Bible, a diary, and several business cards, as well as 900 Taiwan dollars. The diary contained alarming entries. Huang also said that because the ship was in a dangerous situation after Yang boarded, there was no time to check tickets, and Yang did not purchase an additional ticket. When asked if there was a possibility he was hiding, Tang insisted there was absolutely no such possibility. He also inspected the safety equipment on the deck and in the restrooms, which was found to be quite adequate, so it seemed unlikely that he had accidentally fallen overboard.</p>
<p>Claimed His Ticket Was Torn</p>
<p>At this time, they encountered Wu Heming, a passenger who had been in close contact with Yang before the incident. According to Wu, he saw crew members checking tickets at the entrance when Yang boarded the ship. Because Yang did not have a ticket, he was initially prevented from boarding. However, Yang explained that his ticket had been torn by someone at the sugar factory and offered to purchase another ticket, so he was allowed to board. Moreover, Yang seemed to be mentally disturbed at the time, repeatedly shouting "I am a good person," and "Dying on the shore is the same as dying on the ship." However, the passenger ship company did not confirm this information. The Xing He Company also denied tearing Yang's ticket. As for the incident where Yang was surrounded at the pier, Wu also said he did not see it.</p>
<p>Criticized for Mentioning the Cost of Living Index</p>
<p>Wu also provided detailed information about Yang's behavior after boarding the ship. Yang announced to the passengers that after arriving in Taiwan, he had spoken to workers at the sugar factory about the fact that workers' wages in Shanghai were calculated based on the cost of living index, which led to criticism from the company for inappropriate comments. When he announced this, he repeatedly stated: "I am a Christian, not a communist." The passengers all found Yang's words strange and were secretly surprised by them. Yang also sat in the wrong seat and was confronted by a soldier. Yang replied, "Even if I sit here, I won't be sitting for long." Based on the combined investigation, it seems beyond doubt that Yang Jingzhou is dead. However, it remains to be seen whether it was suicide or murder, and further research is needed. The Provincial Police Department has resolved to thoroughly investigate this case.</p>

<h3>Visiting the Agricultural Exhibition in Fuxing Park; Dark Straw Huts and Old Farm Tools; The Agricultural Crisis Deserves Attention</h3>
<p>[Special Report from Our Newspaper] China has always been known as an agricultural country, with 80% of the population engaged in agriculture. However, today's domestic food production cannot meet the demand, and it is necessary to rely on large-scale imports from foreign countries, which shows the state of agricultural production. Most people who grow up in the city are very unfamiliar with everything in the countryside. This time, the Chinese Agricultural Science Research Society held its first agricultural exhibition in Fuxing Park, allowing the citizens of Shanghai to learn about things they didn't know in the past. As written on the wooden plaque at the entrance of the venue: "Looking at the countryside from the agricultural exhibition, thinking about agriculture from the countryside, thinking about farmers from agriculture, every grain is hard-earned, every drop is blood and sweat!"</p>
<p>The content of the exhibition can be said to be rich, divided into food, clothing, housing, transportation, live livestock and poultry, agriculture and science, agriculture and industry, agricultural machinery, agricultural photos, rural conditions, flower gardening, tropical plants, and other sections. Under the systematic organization of many physical objects, diagrams, models, and explanations, the audience can gain a lot of agricultural knowledge. If you carefully visit from beginning to end systematically, you really feel that you benefit more than reading a year of Agricultural Science Overview at the university.</p>
<p>The farm implements displayed at the venue range from the old ox-powered waterwheel and wheelbarrow for transportation to the new American-style pump water pumps, diggers, tractors, and flour mills. These are all of interest to Shanghai citizens, even though there are several centuries of difference between them. The oxcart is written with "Our ancestors' great invention, but unfortunately the descendants have not improved it." Today, Chinese farmers are still using it to irrigate fields, and comparing it with those foreign farm implements, you can understand why China's agricultural production is so backward.</p>
<p>What is the life of Chinese farmers today? There is a low thatched hut in the venue, the scene inside is dark, the furnishings are simple, an old farmer made of paper is lying in broken cotton and straw because of illness, and a young one is eating alone at the table, eating yellow millet bran and a bowl of green vegetables, and there is a high-interest loan IOU on the table. This scene vividly depicts the tragic life of most farmers today. Visitors are very interested in this thatched hut: "This is the home of 350 million compatriots!"</p>
<p>Today, Chinese farmers rely entirely on their innate physical strength, use tools from the primitive era, and mainly rely on water and drought, and insect disasters; safety, exploitation, and fear are often bad. China's agricultural production is either unscientific or primitive, and it is also declining. Many fields are deserted, many river channels are silted up, and many draft animals are slaughtered without replenishment. Agricultural science youths who come out of schools not only have no work to do in rural areas, but also have no work to do in urban agricultural agencies. The widespread mismatch between learning and application and the inability to study with peace of mind will make it impossible for Chinese agriculture to progress.</p>
<p>The purpose and significance of this exhibition, which the Chinese Agricultural Science Research Society spent more than one billion yuan on under difficult economic conditions, is to hope that people in society will pay attention to the importance of agriculture, recognize the crisis of agriculture today, and then actively seek ways to improve it. "Face the agricultural crisis"! I hope that the citizens who have visited will be alerted.</p>
<h3>Great Wall Ship Sets Sail for Assistance; Expected to Arrive in Rongcheng Bay Today</h3>
<p>[Report from Tianjin, 25th] The Great Wall ship sailed from Tanggu to Rongcheng Bay on the 25th to rescue the passengers in distress on the Wanli ship. It is expected to arrive there on the 26th and begin work. Two representatives of the passengers' families are traveling with the ship.</p>
<h3>Sino-Japanese Barter; Four Ships to Sail to Japan</h3>
<p>[Our Report] The transportation work for Sino-Japanese barter is undertaken by four companies: China Merchants, China Xing, Yi Xiang, and China Shipping. The China Merchants Bureau's Haiji ship is currently berthed at Dagu, loading more than 2,000 tons of raw peanuts, soybeans, and bran, and will sail to Kobe as soon as it is fully loaded. The China Xing Company's Yongxing ship is scheduled to sail to Japan at the end of this month, carrying 485 boxes of flavor essence from Shanghai, and then going to Qingdao to load 1,250 tons of raw peanuts, all of which will be transported to Japan. There are also 10,000 tons of salt, which are currently being transported to Taiwan by the China Shipping Company's Australia ship and the Yi Xiang Company's Lini ship to load and transport to Japan. After unloading the above materials in Japan, the ships will load reparations and return to China. The China Trade Bureau is also exchanging 20,000 tons of coal for 21,000 tons of Japanese timber. The coal will soon be shipped from Qinhuangdao.</p>
<h3>Should Judicial Officials Have Party Membership? Joint Petition to the Court for Instructions</h3>
<p>[Our Report] The Kuomintang party departments in various places are urging party members to register, and many judicial officials in various places are members of the Kuomintang. In principle, they should register immediately. However, Article 80 of the Constitution stipulates: "Judges must be independent of parties, make judgments independently based on the law, and not be subject to any interference." Therefore, after the implementation of the Constitution, judicial officials cannot have party membership so that they can handle cases impartially and selflessly. There is a question of how to proceed with the party member registration. Registering would be inconsistent with the Constitution, and not registering would be a violation of party discipline, creating a sense of disorientation. Judicial officials in this city have jointly submitted a petition to the Ministry of Judicial Administration for instructions. The Ministry of Judicial Administration has not been able to decide on this matter and is submitting it to the Executive Yuan for instructions.</p>

<p>General Prices</p>
<h3>Initial Week's Trend Holds Strong, Enters Later Stage of Downward Trend</h3>
<p>Last week, prices, following the fatigue of the previous week, showed signs of movement on Monday, with general trends becoming favorable amidst frequent positive news, especially for stocks and general financial commodities. From Tuesday onwards, as positive news failed to materialize, holders eager to protect their profits sold off, leading to a general decline once again. Subsequently, a period of consolidation ensued, with many prices nearing their levels from the previous weekend by the end of the week. Credit conditions remained loose last week, with the National Bank's bill exchange fluctuating. Interest rates, except for a drop to 2.55% on Friday, remained steady between 2.6% and 2.7%. In the late stages of inflation, people's psychology is extremely fragile, and price fluctuations are highly susceptible to external influences, with reactions being particularly sensitive. This characteristic has been repeatedly discussed in this publication. Last week's prices surged on Monday and declined on Tuesday, with trends reversing within a day. This trend fully demonstrates the aforementioned characteristic and the prominence of speculative motives. The reasons for these rapid fluctuations are listed below:</p>
<p>Regarding the surge in prices on Monday: (1) The most recent adjustment of exchange rates began on April 6th, the second week before last week. At that time, the Foreign Exchange Stabilization Fund Committee raised various exchange rates by 25% to 27%. The benchmark price for US dollars rose to 324,000 yuan, an increase of 69,000 yuan, while the British pound rose to 972,000 yuan, an increase of 207,000 yuan. Exchange rates for Hong Kong dollars and Indian rupees were also increased. Since the second half of last year, the cycle of price increases has shortened, and the speed has accelerated. Therefore, the government's foreign exchange rates must be adjusted from time to time to keep pace. As of last Monday, the government's foreign exchange rates had been stable for more than two weeks, and the difference from black market exchange rates naturally increased day by day. Rumors of adjustment began the week before last and extended to last Monday. General speculation suggested that it was inevitable. With rumors rampant, prices were stimulated to rise; (2) The Hong Kong gold exchange market serves as an indicator of the value of legal tender, and the value of foreign stocks is closely related to the Hong Kong dollar. Therefore, fluctuations in the Hong Kong exchange rate have a very sensitive impact on price fluctuations. Last Monday, when the Hong Kong gold exchange market opened, the price of one million legal tender dropped sharply from 8.67 Hong Kong dollars at the end of the previous week to 8 Hong Kong dollars. The news was a powerful factor stimulating price increases; (3) Recently, prices have gradually stabilized after the major price surge in the second week of March. In the first two weeks of April, the overall wholesale price index rose by less than 4%. In this sluggish situation, sales for industrial and commercial sectors were slow, while expenses could not be reduced. Furthermore, workers' wages still had to be calculated according to the cost of living index, creating a hardship where they had to rely on price increases to survive. Given these circumstances, once the opportunity arose, speculators fanned the flames, deliberately driving up prices and creating a price surge; (4) In the cotton yarn and cloth sector, under the above stimuli, purchases from Tianjin, Guangdong, and Hubei further boosted the market, adding fuel to the fire. From Tuesday onwards, general prices fell sharply again. The reasons that can be stated are: (1) Rumors of extended foreign exchange releases did not materialize. Recently, the foreign exchange management authorities have been quite distressed about this. Raising prices would stimulate inflation and draw criticism from all sides, while low prices would make it impossible to absorb foreign exchange funds, leading to overseas remittances evading regulations, hindering exports, and rampant smuggling, putting them in a dilemma; (2) After the sharp increase on Monday, many parties, having profited, reconsidered and sold off; (3) With the situation of inflation worsening day by day, the more currency issued, the lower the purchasing power, leading to sluggish sales and a lack of purchasing power; (4) The regulations for issuing short-term treasury bills were officially announced by the National Government last Monday, and it was reported that the National Bank would organize a special committee to handle the matter, preparing to entrust brokers to auction them at 85% of their face value on the stock exchange. This appeared to be imminent, diverting investment targets, and strengthening the sellers' sentiment; (5) In the cotton yarn and cloth sector, the China Textile Corporation allocated and sold as many as 40 types of cloth, with no increase or decrease compared to the previous period, leading to a resurgence of short-selling and a downward trend in prices. In addition, regarding the government's price measures last week, the following can be mentioned: First, Shi Zhaoying, Director of the Intelligence Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, stated at a press conference held by the News Bureau of the Executive Yuan last week that the Chinese government had considered establishing an agency under the Executive Yuan to decide on policies regarding US aid. At the same time, existing institutions handling urban food supply, cotton, and oil would be fully utilized for the actual administrative work of the aid program to China. Second, the Ministry of Finance previously promulgated implementation measures for the management of remittances and cash transportation between Shanghai and Guangzhou. Recently, two points were added to the scope of cash transportation use in Article 4 of the measures, with the intention of ensuring that commercial firms could only transfer funds for genuine working capital needs, preventing speculative activities under false pretenses. Third, since the order to stop deferred settlement of Chinese stocks, banks and trust companies operating group arbitrage as legal brokers have converted their original arbitrage into weekly deposits. According to investigations, the amount absorbed is estimated to be around two trillion yuan. The Financial Management Bureau is paying close attention to how these weekly savings deposits are used by various banks. In addition to transferring these funds to industry and commerce and the National Bank, they are investigating whether they are being used for speculation. Fourth, the fluctuation of rice market prices depends on whether the Civil Food Allocation Committee decides to purchase. Prices rise upon hearing of purchases and stabilize upon hearing of cessation. According to officials of the committee, rationing by population was originally a trial measure. The food supply for April, May, and June has already been prepared. The food supply for the next period, July, August, and September, seems to be still unresolved. The only option is to purchase from the market, but given the current environment, this is a major undertaking, and the committee cannot act rashly. Recently, Wu Kaixian, Director of the Social Affairs Bureau, went to the capital to report on this matter. It is said that a result has been achieved. Furthermore, after rationing rice, the committee is now implementing rationing of oil. It is planned to extend the rationing of coal from May onwards, with the purchase procedures being the same as for rice. Fifth, in the past, national banks and bureaus have maintained a low-interest rate policy for deposits and loans. This practice has long been criticized by most economists, with more disadvantages than advantages. The authorities have also realized the inappropriateness of this traditional approach and are seeking reforms. Recently, it has been reported that the Joint Treasury has decided to adjust interest rates in a gradual manner, aiming to approach the market's shadow interest rates within a reasonable period.</p>
<p>Under the aforementioned circumstances, last week's price movements were large and rapid, but after Tuesday, they gradually stabilized, trending downwards. In the stock market, the market opened strongly on Monday amidst numerous positive rumors. The Shanghai stock market broke through the 2,100 mark for Wing On Textile, and ten stocks, including China Cement and China興業, reached their limit. Details are described in the stock market section of this publication below. In the cotton yarn and cloth market, people's sentiment was also greatly stimulated. Buying was strong, with 42-count Blue Phoenix reaching 240 million, an increase of 6 million compared to the previous weekend. 20-count Double Horse reached 144 million, an increase of 9 million compared to the previous weekend. Leader fine cloth rose to 5.16 million, closing at 5.02 million. However, from Tuesday onwards, the good times did not last. Except for Leader fine cloth, which briefly reached 5.2 million and closed at 4.94 million, 42-count Blue Phoenix fell back to 235 million, and 20-count Double Horse fell back to 138 million. Subsequently, the trend was downward, with mixed results compared to the closing price of the previous weekend, with little difference. Regarding rice, the market opened on Monday with news of falling rice prices in Wuxi and an increase in arrivals. Sales were sluggish, and prices fell slightly. In the southern market, premium white rice fell by 50,000 yuan compared to the previous weekend to 3.7 million yuan per shi. On Tuesday, due to rising rice prices in Wuxi and rumors of the Civil Adjustment Committee purchasing surplus rice, prices rose to 3.8 million yuan. Subsequently, rice prices in Wuxi gradually stabilized, and the Civil Adjustment Committee sold substandard white rice in the market, returning to 3.7 million yuan on Thursday. The fluctuation range was not significant, remaining within 100,000 yuan. Miscellaneous grains and cooking oil followed rice, with similar trends. Daily necessities such as soap and matches only experienced slight price fluctuations due to sluggish sales. Other items such as building materials, chemicals, and hardware mostly remained stable, with minimal fluctuations.</p>

<h3>Monetary Finance</h3>
<p>(1) Credit Conditions and Shadow Interest Rates</p>
<p>This week, it was hoped that credit conditions in the city would tighten from loose, but this did not materialize due to the following reasons: First, the short-term treasury bills were delayed; Second, although the finished products purchased by the China Trust Bureau were auctioned, the payment was not yet due; Third, funds from the North continued to flow south. It was reported that funds from Northeast Japan flowing into China had reached over one trillion, and the route was generally from Tianjin to Shanghai. Fourth, because financial commodities in Guangzhou were temporarily higher than in the city, some funds flowed back into the city last week; Fifth, general prices showed signs of stability and sluggishness due to stagnant sales, so goods firms were mostly watching and seeking funds was not enthusiastic; Sixth, government spending remained high as before, and state-owned banks were continuously withdrawing funds from Tuesday onwards. These factors were the main reasons for the continued loose credit conditions last week. If short-term treasury bills can be issued on schedule this week and the auction proceeds from the finished products can be recovered one after another, credit conditions may tighten across the board.</p>
<p>From Monday to Friday last week, the exchange results of national banks showed a net inflow of 480.7 billion, but if the 920 billion in fixed deposits of commercial banks in the National Bank over the five days is deducted, the actual net outflow of national banks was 439.3 billion.</p>
<p>In commercial banks, because there were few demanders and the supply of funds was abundant, interbank lending was greatly reduced, and seeking loans was very convenient. Shadow interest rates generally stood at 2.7%, although they briefly rose to 3% for one or two days on Monday and Tuesday, but soon fell back to the original level. The exchange results of firms after the 60th numbered firms showed a total net outflow of 10.539 trillion from Monday to Friday. Although the outflow was large, the firms also delivered more than 400 billion in cash to the National Bank in the five days, which shows the abundance of the supply of funds. Last week, the external interest rate for securities firms, from Monday to Wednesday, was that the buying side posted an increase from 22 yuan to 33 yuan per share, and the selling side posted an increase from 19 yuan to 20 yuan per share, but after Wednesday, it decreased repeatedly. On Friday, the buying side only posted 21 yuan, and the selling side was as low as 18 yuan.</p>
<p>Foreign banks had a total net inflow of 843.8 billion in five days. The net inflow of 289.4 billion on Tuesday alone set a record. Although the premium for Guangzhou exchange fell last week, the advance of foreign firms increased without decreasing. The severe southward flow of funds and the paths it took, as demonstrated by this, are noteworthy.</p>
<p>(Domestic and Foreign Exchange Rates)</p>
<p>Last week, the premium for Guangzhou exchange in domestic exchange markets fell repeatedly. On Tuesday, it even fell to a premium of 20 yuan per thousand yuan. On other days, it was only around 30 or 40 yuan. It is said that this was caused by the high prices of financial commodities in Guangzhou and the reverse flow of funds. In addition, it is related to the increase of foreign banks and the southward flow of US dollar short-term treasury bills. Although the paths of funds fleeing south are different, the large amounts are still noteworthy. The premium for Qingdao exchange also continued to decrease from 150 yuan per thousand yuan on Monday to 120 yuan on Friday. The premium for Chongqing exchange remained stable at 10 yuan for five days. The premium for Hankou exchange also decreased from 40 yuan to 20 yuan. The discount for Tianjin exchange once reached 130 yuan on Monday and Tuesday, which is said to be related to the fact that more than one trillion in funds from the Northeast are coming south via Tianjin.</p>
<p>Last week, the foreign exchange benchmark rate was not raised. However, the Hong Kong Shanghai exchange rate still showed a decrease. On Tuesday, it once decreased sharply to 73 cents in Hong Kong dollars, equivalent to 100,000 yuan in legal tender. Although it increased slightly after Wednesday, it was still shorter than the previous week. The market price of Hong Kong banknotes was about 5.7 Hong Kong dollars. The range of fluctuation was within 5 cents in Hong Kong dollars.</p>
<p>(3) Chinese and Foreign Stock Markets</p>
<p>Recently, the Chinese stock market has been hovering in a sluggish situation. Last week, credit conditions were loose and the Hong Kong exchange rate also contracted, but the overall appearance was still sluggish, and the market had little stimulus from buying interest. Coupled with the widespread rumors that treasury bills would soon be issued, and credit conditions were expected to tighten, new buyers were mostly watching, and long positions were also willing to sell, resulting in a general sluggish situation for various stocks during the week. Trading was also very quiet. Although Wing On Textile broke through the 2,000 yuan mark again at the beginning of the week, it subsequently weakened. Thus, comparing the closing price on Friday last week with the opening price at the end of the previous week, Wing On Textile showed a gain of 10%, Jinglun had no change, China Silk and China Cement only had a gain of 3%, and Xin Yi actually fell by 7%. If comparing the closing price on Friday last week with the beginning of Monday, various stocks showed a general decline of about 10%.</p>
<p>Foreign stocks suddenly strengthened on Monday. Ewo Silk rose to 2.96 million yuan, an increase of 250,000 yuan compared to last Saturday. The reason was that the Hong Kong exchange rate contracted and there were rumors of foreign exchange liberalization, resulting in improved sentiment, dry-up of floating shares, and soaring market prices. British-American Tobacco was 3.45 million yuan, and Jardine Matheson was 6.7 million yuan, all showing compensation. However, by Wednesday, due to reports of tight credit conditions, the cotton cloth returned, and financial commodities fell, Ewo Silk also fell back from its high price, closing at 2.75 million yuan. British-American Tobacco was 3.28 million yuan, and Jardine Matheson was 6.48 million yuan. On Wednesday, because foreign exchange was not raised, market prices hovered and waited, with minimal rises and falls. By Thursday, the situation was slightly stronger because retail investors absorbed some, and Ewo Silk rose again to 2.8 million yuan. British-American Tobacco was around 3.3 million yuan, and Jardine Matheson was 6.4 million yuan. On Friday, it had become a consolidated market, with minimal movements. The weekend was also sluggish. In short, this weekend, due to the downward movement of foreign exchange rates, sentiment was dimmed, transactions were sparse, and market prices were difficult to boost.</p>
<h3>Industrial and Commercial Dynamics</h3>
<p>(1) How will the "stalemate" in Sino-Japanese trade be broken?</p>
<p>Since last week, there have been many reports of Sino-Japanese private trade, which has been in a stalemate for a long time, showing signs of becoming more active. According to a report from the Central News Agency in Tokyo on the 19th, Tang Juying, a representative of the trade group of the Chinese delegation to Japan, believes that the 10 billion yuan debt owed by the China Trust Bureau in Sino-Japanese trade is the main reason for the stalemate in Sino-Japanese trade, and the Allied Headquarters is even opposed to offsetting this debt with reparations in kind to China. In this case, within the China Trust Bureau's plan for this year to export 20,000 tons of soybeans, 5,000 tons of soybean oil, 500,000 piculs of soybean cake, 30,000 piculs of peanuts, 50 piculs of salt, and 10,000 piculs of raw hides to Japan, a portion must be deducted for debt repayment. Outside the scope of government trade, private individuals are only allowed to operate a few items such as hemp, tung oil, bran, pig iron, and medicinal materials, and it is estimated that the trade volume is less than one-tenth of the total trade volume. The trade method is to adopt a bookkeeping and signing method through regulatory agencies, that is, as agreed by Madge, director of the Economic and Scientific Group of the Allied Headquarters, to use the method of bartering to make up for the shortage of foreign exchange. It is reported that the second batch of 12 representatives of private trade to Japan will go to Japan in batches within days. On the 21st, the representatives held a meeting in the city and decided to replace competition with cooperation and planned to export large quantities of agricultural products.</p>
<p>Judging from various signs, if trade with Japan will gradually become active in the future, then under the policy of the United States deliberately supporting Japan, the situation of "an industrial Japan and an agricultural China" may still remain. Not only that, but China's national industry in the midst of storms and turmoil will inevitably suffer further destruction from Japanese industry. First, in terms of the government authorities of both sides, the China Trust Bureau of China plans to ship a large number of agricultural products to Japan this year, and the Japanese Trade Agency is also planning to exchange 1 million tons of steel for manganese ore and silicon ore of equal value (Central News Agency, Tokyo, 15th). According to Agence France-Presse, Tokyo, 23rd, more than 8,000 tons of iron ore from Hainan Island, China, are re-exported to supply Yawata Steel Works. As for the production equipment generally expected, such as steel pipes for construction, steel plates, and steel wire for textiles, it is reported that "Japan does not yet have the ability to export." From this, it can also be seen that China's exports to Japan are still mainly raw materials, while Japan's exports to China are, at best, finished products for direct consumption. Undoubtedly, China's industrial circles will suffer a serious blow!</p>
<p>From the telegram from Washington on the 21st, it was learned that the US Export-Import Bank has announced that the bank will jointly lend 660,000 US dollars to three commercial banks to help Japan purchase American cotton. Although it was once rumored in London that the British and American textile industries recently agreed to reduce Japan's cotton textile industry, the US Department of the Army believes that there is no reason. In today's America, where soldiers control politics, Japan's fate is naturally decided by the US military. Japan's textile industry is thriving. According to the recent report of the Japan Textile Industry Association, Japan's cotton spinning industry reached 3.1 million spindles in May, an increase of more than 26,000 spindles compared to February (Reuters, Tokyo, 19th). What is the end result of the increase in spindles and the input of gold dollars? The end result is that as of the end of January this year, Japan's cotton cloth inventory had reached 312 million square yards, worth about 150 million US dollars. At the same time, Japan's textile industry, due to rumors that it can import 1.3 million bales of American cotton within the US fiscal year from July this year to promote work, is now considering how to deal with these 312 million square yards of inventory. China, due to its vastness and poverty, is indeed a good target for dealing with this inventory. At a time when the "stalemate" in trade with Japan is about to "soften," it is worth noting by Chinese people, especially the Chinese textile industry.</p>
<p>(2) Can the prices of public utilities be stabilized?</p>
<p>The "leading price increase" of public utilities seems to have aroused the attention of the senators. The Council formally telegraphed the Executive Yuan on the 17th, requesting it to quickly consider stopping the continued application of the price calculation formula for public utilities, restoring the subsidy policy, and requesting the authorities to stop applying this formula from May onwards before an appropriate solution is decided, so as to avoid the serious consequences of causing social unrest. In addition to telegraphing the superiors to express "public opinion," the Senate also decided to form groups to investigate in order to clarify responsibilities. This may have busied the municipal administration of this city. The Director of the Public Utilities Bureau specially visited President Zhang of the Central Bank on the 16th, and there were talks between President Zhang and Mayor Wu on the morning of the 19th. It is said that they all unanimously discussed how to prevent the prices of public utilities from rising sharply. It seems that the municipal authorities understand the logic of price increases in this way: the main costs of public utilities are foreign exchange, hardware raw materials, fuel, and the cost of living index. Therefore, if the government can continue to adopt a subsidy policy for public utilities, there will be no further sharp increases in the future. Therefore, the main point of consultation between the Director of the Public Utilities Bureau and the President of the Central Bank is how to settle foreign exchange for fuel oil and gasoline in advance. The Fuel Management Committee also believes that allocating the coal needed by public utilities in advance will also help stabilize the prices of public utilities. It is said that the Central Bank has, in principle, approved lending for the funds needed by public utilities for early settlement of foreign exchange, etc. In that case, the "stability of May" can be achieved without problems. All these measures and theories are obviously based on the formula "one thing's price increase is because another thing's price increase" is established, but common sense can explain that this is a circular formula. The price increase of public utilities is indeed partly due to the stimulation of the rising cost of living index, but how can it be seen that the sharp rise in the cost of living index is not affected by the price increase of public utilities! The subsidy policy can indeed stabilize the prices of public utilities for a while, but the fiscal deficit increased due to the subsidy cannot but be a major factor in the general price increase. The circular formula will still bring about a circular effect. Anyway, the facts will give the most ruthless test!</p>

<p>Science</p>
<h3>Biological Science in Shanghai</h3>
<p>— Jingyi</p>
<p>Biology is the most rapidly developing science of the 20th century. Besides studying the problems of life, it has also opened up new avenues for agriculture, industry, and medicine. In the past two decades, its connection with physics and chemistry, its mutual advancement, is an even more valuable path. The number of people engaged in biological science research in our country is not small. There are many specialized research institutions, such as the Jing Sheng Biological Investigation Institute in Beiping, the Beiping Research Institute, the Biological Research Institute of the Science Society of China, and the Institute of Zoology and Botany of the Academia Sinica. Most universities also have departments of animal husbandry. Many people are sent abroad every year to engage in specialized research. Biology in China should have a vigorous and hopeful future. Indeed, this science is too close to everyone's life. It has a direct relationship with the national economy and the people's livelihood. However, in fact, most people have not deeply recognized its importance, thinking that the study of flowers, birds, insects, and fish is only a scholarly embellishment. Therefore, biology in China is still in its infancy, and to this day it is only "a subject" in school education. Some people think that current biological research cannot affect the masses, and it is not visible in society. Under such circumstances, we feel that the establishment of a society is imperative. Therefore, we established the "Shanghai Biological Society" to meet the needs of this time and place, and with the support of the local educational community, we have set a work plan. For the past two months, we have been actively promoting the society's affairs (the address is 200 Yongkang Road), adhering to the serious attitude of science and the spirit of seeking truth, and striving to move forward.</p>
<p>The basic members of the Biological Society are mostly biology teachers from various middle schools, so greater gains can be made in improving teaching and popularizing biological knowledge. We know that experts conduct in-depth exploration, focusing on the discovery of new knowledge and principles. At the same time, it is also essential to transmit this knowledge to the majority of people and put it into practice, and perhaps even more important than advanced research. Our main tasks are: (1) research on theories and techniques of biological science; (2) introduction of the development of biological science and its teaching in various countries; (3) collection, compilation, and research on methods of improving teaching materials and experiments in biology; (4) collection of biological science books, specimens, and research materials; (5) editing and publishing of biological science materials. These five key points not only directly contribute to the improvement of teaching but also affect the promotion of biological science, at least raising the general public's attention and interest in biology.</p>
<p>Today, cultural workers are all suffocated by the pressure of life, but the several people in charge of the Biological Society seem to have forgotten these things, working energetically and enthusiastically. On the one hand, they receive strong encouragement from the education authorities, and on the other hand, advanced figures in the biological community also extend a helping hand to support them. Therefore, every member of this society is like a bee busy working on a rose, pollinating, making honey, and benefiting society. This symbol is indeed very meaningful. It is said that they have engraved this profound meaning into their emblem as a symbol of the society. The society has joined the Science Society of China as a group member, which has provided more practical assistance. They have hired Bing Zhi, Lu Yudao, Liu Cheng, Wang Zhijia, and Wang Jiaji as honorary directors, hoping that they will provide guidance at any time. At the same time, they also hope to establish contact with various schools to further expand the scope.</p>
<p>They are planning to edit a series of books, focusing on general biology, life problems, human physiology, and increased production technology. Academic lectures have already been given by Mr. Bing Zhi at Guanghua University, and they are still being held. They do not want to work on popularizing biological knowledge to the public, and are preparing to cooperate with the Mass Education Experimental School, or use broadcasting to promote it. These tasks require time and effort to achieve, but they only ask about cultivation and do not consider how to harvest.</p>
<p>The improvement of biological teaching is an urgent matter. The Biological Society has organized another committee to conduct research and discussion. Only those who teach in the field can obtain the points that should be noted. In the future, they can publish their experiences in curriculum materials and equipment, and improve the entire science teaching to remedy the current deficiencies.</p>
<p>The Biological Society is constrained by funding, and the society newsletter is being worked on with all efforts. We hope that this newly formed academic organization will grow from Shanghai to the whole country. Colleagues who study biology must be willing to know this news. In the current unstable situation of science in China, we should all contribute our strength to promote the scientificization of our country, both vertically and horizontally, and need to promote it. The Shanghai Biological Society is a seed with vitality, germinating, perhaps this lovely seedling will thrive, with luxuriant branches and leaves. We all have earnest hope!</p>
<h3>Solid Water</h3>
<p>— Yepu</p>
<p>Ice is familiar to everyone, but few people know about "solid water." Some people may think this is ice, but it is definitely not. Although it has the same cold and hard properties as ice, the two are completely different because ice is crystalline and solid water is not crystalline. This new substance was invented in 1940 by Dr. B.J. Luyet of St. Louis University in the United States.</p>
<p>The manufacturing of solid water is not difficult. The main tools are a toy gun for children and two metal condensers. Because inside this gun, there are mechanisms such as springs and plungers; when the trigger is pulled, ordinary water is shot out from it, lying flat between two brass discs. These two brass discs are prepared in advance and their temperature has been lowered with liquid air. The water shot into it is suddenly subjected to this severe cooling, and before it can freeze into ice crystals, it condenses into a glass-like film attached to the brass discs. This is solid water.</p>
<p>Solid water is rare. To prove the difference between it and ice, Dr. Luyet specially took a piece, placed it on extremely cold glass, put it in front of a microscope, and combined it with a cross polarized optical Valves; with the help of Polarized—light, he told us that except for what was placed there was crystalline, absolutely no light could pass through. Behind this microscope, a camera was connected, relying on the image taken by the photographs, proved that all was darkness, not exposed to light. This is indeed non-crystalline solid water. Then, this piece of solid water slowly absorbed the surrounding heat, began to melt, gradually producing crystals, and transforming into ice, so the photograph was exposed to light and gradually became brighter. Finally, it still melted into liquid water.</p>
<h3>Professor Einstein</h3>
<p>— Wang Qiande</p>
<p>Professor Albert Einstein, the founder of the theory of relativity, was exiled to the United States when Hitler was in power in Germany due to his Jewish heritage. He taught at the Institute for Advanced Study at Princeton University and later became an American citizen. During the war, he participated in the research of the atomic bomb. After the war, based on his scholar's position, he advocated the publication of the secrets of the atomic bomb and did not approve of control measures, but this was not approved by many American colleagues. Recently, he declared that if atomic energy is not used to benefit mankind, he will stop researching atomic energy. (Or)</p>
<h3>The Art of Prolonging Life</h3>
<p>— Wang</p>
<p>The pioneer of longevity work was Bogomolets. The method he adopted at that time was to use a special serum to prevent the pains of old age. Although this method cannot be said to be ineffective, it is at least not a specific medicine for longevity; and the method used is only to extend human life by the principle of a certain long thing, so his creation has diminished quietly and has not been widely adopted.</p>
<p>Now, Soviet medical doctor Surikov at the Moscow First Raw Material Institute's biological laboratory has restarted his research, and as a result he has discovered, or it can be said he has achieved, that he can use a method to isolate the "pigment of old age," which can extend the days of old age, that is, extend human life.</p>
<p>But what is the "pigment of old age"? Surikov only gave a simple explanation: "It is a pure substance that is not easy to find in the bodies of children and young people, and it is even impossible to find it at all."</p>
<p>At the same time, the director of the laboratory, Dr. N.A. Ilyin, also discovered a new method. He announced in the February issue of "Soviet Women" that a powdery substance extracted from the cerebral matter has considerable efficacy in prolonging life. This substance is called "Substance of old age."</p>
<p>Where is this "substance of old age" found? It is found in living cells. Due to the discovery and application of this substance, the extension of life has become more secure.</p>
<p>Although the extension of life has considerable certainty, protecting one's own body is still the most important thing. You cannot smoke, because smoking is extremely harmful to your body. Excessive smoking will cost you your life. You should have proper time for work and rest. Too much work and too much rest will also damage your body, and you should also do more physical exercises; so-called physical exercises, such as playing ball and doing morning exercises; these things especially women should pay more attention to, because diseases are much more damaging to women than to men.</p>
<p>Finally, by citing Buffon Furance Rule, it is known that human life can be extended to six or seven times as long as the youth development cycle. In other words, it can be extended to one hundred and seventy-five years, because the human youth development cycle is from twenty to twenty-five years.</p>
<h3>How Machines Plant Rice and Mill Rice</h3>
<p>Our country, which has always produced and consumed rice, has actually asked the American people, who have always eaten wheat, for rice because of frequent war disasters! According to statistics, in 1947, the rice shipped from the United States to East Asia exceeded 1.2 billion pounds.</p>
<p>More than half of the world's population eats rice, and most of them are Easterners. However, the United States has now become the world's second-largest rice producer due to mechanical farming and planting. Although our country is still the largest rice producer, there are 16 million people suffering from famine in Hunan and Guangxi provinces alone.</p>
<p>In 1946, the United States produced a total of 2.1 billion pounds of rice, two-thirds of which was surplus. Rice is not native to the United States, so why are Americans so good at growing it? How do they grow it?</p>
<p>Farmers in California use airplanes to sow rice seeds on the water surface, and then harvest it using the Combinedrie—rmethod, so they have become the world's number one in machine-planted rice. They use tractors to pull a row of nail-toothed harrows as wide as 30 feet to lay out the seedbeds. Compared to the primitive harrows pulled by cattle in the East, it is of course incomparable.</p>
<p>More important is the problem of irrigation. In the East, cattle, horses, or manpower are used to draw water into the fields; but in California, farmers only need the convenience of turning on a tap. When the irrigation tap is turned on, the water rolls down magnificently. At the same time, for the removal of weeds and unwanted plants, in the East, there is no other way than to manually pull them out step by step, but in California, farmers only remove the water from the farmland shortly before harvest, and otherwise it is permanently immersed in water. Therefore, weeds have no way to grow, and there is no need to remove weeds. This method was invented twenty years ago by Mr. Jones, an expert from the U.S. Department of Agriculture, because rice seeds can germinate and take root in the soil in the water, and stretch their first leaf out of the water; but weeds cannot stretch out of the water, so they die.

<h3>Psychology of Errors</h3>
<p>— Huang Baoduan</p>
<p>The psychology of errors has research value, and it is also very interesting. Knowing some theories will be somewhat beneficial to your future career.</p>
<p>First, ask yourself if you have made any of the following kinds of mistakes, or similar jokes:</p>
<p>(A) You clearly put two umbrellas outside, but you are looking for them everywhere indoors. You clearly put things in place A, but you look for them for a long time in place B.</p>
<p>(B) You clearly know that your friend is "Zhang San", but you mistakenly call him "Li Si". Sometimes, you can't even call out the name of an old friend or colleague who you see every day, but after some time you can naturally remember it again.</p>
<p>(C) You sometimes confuse the words "Li" and "Li", "Duan" and "Rui", "Bady" and "Baby" or "Quiet" and "Quite"... etc. You misread or miswrite them.</p>
<p>(D) The sound of a car is mistaken for the sound of an airplane. (This situation was common during the Sino-Japanese War)</p>
<p>I believe that many people have made similar mistakes (or errors). It seems that these small errors are not worth paying attention to. In fact, these small errors, whether directly or indirectly, will affect a person's career and life. This kind of situation (many and also very complicated). In psychology, they are all called "errors".</p>
<p>We divide these errors into: (1) slips of the tongue, (2) misprints, (3) visual errors, (4) auditory errors, and (5) forgetting and misplacing.</p>
<p>(1) Slips of the tongue—for example: you clearly know the name of this colleague or classmate, but when you call him, you call out the name of another person, you should have said "A": but you say "B"... etc. Saying words that are different from your intentions belongs to this category.</p>
<p>(2) Misprints—this situation is very common, you can often see it in other people's and your own letters or articles. Once I saw on a relative's letter: "Deceased father..." This sentence surprised me very much, because he was a high school student. Later, I learned that he usually hated "nuns" and "matchmakers" etc. He thought that the word "姑" was an inauspicious word, but he explained that he clearly wrote the word "姑", so how could it become "故"... Like (C) etc. all belong to this category.</p>
<p>(3) Visual errors—for example, recognizing the wrong person during the day, or misreading things, etc. all belong to this category. Visual errors often cause reading errors, but reading errors are not necessarily caused by visual errors such as (A).</p>
<p>(4) Auditory errors—this cannot refer to errors caused by similar sounds, it should refer to errors caused by two different sounds where someone uses B instead of A. For example: soldiers in the army mistake the sound of cicadas for the sound of whistles. Before the War of Resistance was over, an old man in my neighborhood was scared to death by the sound of a ten-wheeled truck. These similar situations are the result of auditory errors.</p>
<p>(5) Forgetting and misplacing—your scissors were just in your hand not long ago, and suddenly they are gone, but after a while you find them unintentionally, this is also the result of forgetting and misplacing. Everyone knows the story of a certain inventor who actually put a watch in a pot to boil it as an egg. Such as (A) (B) etc. all belong to this category.</p>
<p>So; why do the above situations occur?</p>
<p>Here we must first know that we all have the ability of intention (meaning), but intention sometimes appears in the conscious world or is hidden in the subconscious world. Its activity is displayed by consciousness, or by various intentions with "emotional molecules", special combinations, these special combinations of intentions are called "Complexes" or "Uncomscious", complexes and consciousness are incompatible, and often conflict, but are often suppressed by consciousness, and cannot directly appear in the conscious world; therefore, these complexes are often forgotten. For example: someone hates something or has done something in the past that he now considers shameful, so whenever he thinks of this thing, he feels uneasy or ashamed. In this way, someone's memory of this thing has become a complex, and this "complex" is not tolerated by the entire personality, because the complex has Dynamogenic, so it often conflicts with the personality (consciousness), if the power of the latter is greater than the former—the complex is often suppressed—that is, someone "suppresses" this hateful or shameful complex to avoid conflict, so that it cannot invade the conscious realm, in order to obtain psychological peace, and often results in "forgetting", creating phenomena of category (5).</p>
<p>However, the amount of "energy" possessed by the "complex" is proportional to the intensity of the emotional molecules. Therefore, when the large amount of emotional content attached to this complex is suppressed, it decomposes and separates from the associations with other facts in mental life. Therefore, this "energy" is not easy to vent, but is always seeking a venting opportunity, or changing form to be presented to the conscious world in the direction of the least resistance; or waiting until sufficient "energy" accumulates beyond the resistance (suppression force), then an Explosion or attack occurs. Once this energy is freed, it also appears in the conscious world. Therefore; when awake, there will be jokes, errors (such as (1)-(5), especially (1) and (2) are the most common), madness... etc.; in sleep, it is displayed in dreams (as mentioned in my previous article "Dreams" in issue 25 of this journal).</p>
<p>So when someone forgets or miscalls your name, then you have to pay special attention, if you also miscall someone else's name or miswrite someone's address, it will also cause the other party's resentment...</p>
<p>Although the above are all simple examples, the purpose is to give readers a simple concept, so that readers can gain some understanding or know the main cause of these "errors"; and reduce a little loss caused by "errors". (End).</p>

<h3>A Gentleman Respects Himself</h3>
<p>— Pingzhai</p>
<p>The current situation has reached today, and it cannot be said that it is not serious. Under such a serious situation, the convening of the constitutional National Assembly is even more significant. However, since the opening of the National Assembly, the behavior shown by some representatives has really made us ordinary people feel extremely heartbroken and unable to cry—first, it created a world of "boo!" in the venue, and even the owner of the Ling Xiaohan Pavilion had the wonderful saying of "creating a new record of booing"; then there were representatives who wanted to hit the chairman of the meeting. According to the Nanjing telegram in this newspaper on the 23rd: "Chairman Hu (Jingan) of the Congress... originally intended to defend himself, but seeing that the situation was not good, he struggled out of the encirclement and escaped to the small door in the rear right corner. Dozens of representatives from Yunnan Shun'ning, including Zhang Tingxun, who was the county magistrate of Dali County, and Li Hongru, the labor union representative who was originally a signatory for concession and only managed to attend after running around, took the lead in roaring and chasing, making a mess on the stage. Several journalists asked Zhang for his name, but Zhang refused to answer, instead secretly hiding his badge with his name and number in his pocket, and continued to pursue Hu. The reporters insisted on seeing the badge, and during the dispute, his badge was torn off. Only then did they know that it was Zhang Tingxun. At that time, Hu had already hidden away in the meantime. Zhang then shifted his target and glared at the reporters, almost wanting to use force..."</p>
<p>And on the 24th, the newspaper published the news that "Guangdong representatives and Guangdong overseas Chinese representatives actually smashed the Nanjing Salvation Daily, and several people were injured!" The National Assembly, which the government spends billions of dollars on every day, has left these stains that will stink for ten thousand years, and foreign reporters have sent out special dispatches, spreading it as an international joke—National Assembly representatives should represent the people of the whole country. Today, we ordinary people really feel a little surprised by these tricks, because we have always thought that even if these representatives cannot all be polite, at least there will not be those "glaring" thugs—the representatives are still full of spirit, but we ordinary people feel ashamed for them!</p>
<p>Logically, the reason why the democratic system is worth praising is mainly because it can enable the minority to have an opportunity to express their opinions. The American founding father Jefferson once said to a political enemy: "I firmly oppose your opinion; but I will fight desperately—to give you the opportunity to speak." The mission of constitutionalism is not light. Every representative should know that this is a big step for China to embark on the path of democracy, and the "boo" in the National Assembly fundamentally shattered the word "democracy"! As for the "heroes" Zhang Tingxun and Li Hongru, who "roared and chased" the chairman, their arrogance and inferiority are not worth my ink, but what I want to ask is: Is it difficult to find other representatives who are deeply aware of righteousness in the National Assembly—why did they allow one or two black sheep to create such an unforgivable act without restraint? Why did the righteous and stern rebuke of several journalists in the assembly hall make these thugs who "attacked" the chairman of the National Assembly submissive, while the representatives themselves witnessed this ugly scene, but just stood by and did not say a word? Are you "conniving at evil" or "colluding with filth"?</p>
<p>The recent smashing of the Salvation Daily is even more absurd and lawless! If you become a National Assembly representative, can you just arbitrarily beat people and arbitrarily break the law in the capital? A National Assembly representative who commits violence and beats people is an offender in the act, and the judicial authorities should immediately arrest them and punish them severely. In addition to their criminal responsibilities for injury, they should also be charged with the crime of gathering crowds to disrupt the order of the rear during the suppression of the rebellion, in order to slightly correct international perception and slightly extend national justice! I do not know Gong Debai personally, and I have always disagreed with many of the Salvation Daily's statements, but since the Constitution grants people freedom of speech, then those representatives who are responsible for implementing the Constitution should respect Gong Debai's freedom to speak freely. If Gong Debai's remarks contain slander or other violations of the law, the parties concerned can justly sue in court and demand that Gong Debai be punished for the crimes he deserves. Why, with the status of a dignified National Assembly representative, dare they not openly and honestly resort to the law, but insist on taking the means of thugs? Of course, these people are willing to stoop to this, so we have nothing to say, but we have to appeal to the majority of representatives who abide by the law: Gentlemen, you should know to respect yourselves. You cannot allow these few black sheep to continue to tarnish the reputation of all the representatives. If there is still a little bit of the shadow of the people who elected you that day in your minds today, you should take action to distinguish between right and wrong. Otherwise, it is difficult to prevent the long-standing criticism of the people, and the pens of Chinese and foreign historians will not easily forgive people!</p>
<h3>Also Speaking of Marriage Education</h3>
<p>— Yi Jun</p>
<p>Regarding the matter of Shanghai College planning to add a course on marriage next semester, many have already discussed it, and everyone's opinions are uniformly in agreement, so there's originally no need to discuss it again. However, the author is an unmarried young man, about to graduate from university, already reaching the advanced age of "twenty-five this year, clothes torn with no one to mend," deeply fearing that the fate of "if you want someone to mend, wait another twenty-five" will befall me, which would truly be terrible! As it's a personal issue, not minding the wordiness, I'll also talk about it.</p>
<p>First, let me honestly tell you (actually, you already know): During ordinary leisure time after class, male students gathered together most enjoy talking about, first, women, second, women, and third, still women. I think the female students' leisure activities or work naturally involve talking about men and discussing husbands.</p>
<p>Suppressing the tendency to pay attention to the opposite sex is originally a strong human instinct, as important as hunger for food and thirst for drink. As far as school students are concerned, they probably become aware of the difference between men and women in the upper grades of elementary school, begin to admire each other in junior high school, reach the intensity of dry wood meeting fire in senior high school, and in university, they can go through fire and water for their lovers, unafraid of death. Pursuits can be crazy, and heartbreak can lead to suicide, which is extremely grand! Therefore, is the meaning of marriage merely about continuing the family line? This is an extremely important part of life. Not getting married means lacking an extremely wonderful program in life, which is an incomplete life.</p>
<p>Old-fashioned marriages relied solely on parents' orders and matchmakers' words, resulting in rigid matches with no room for choice. If it turned out well, it was luck; if it turned out poorly, it was deserved. Fortunately, that era is almost over.</p>
<p>However, what are the results of new-style marriages? While many marriages are happy, there are also many that result in tragedy. Some lovers are unable to become spouses, and many who marry cannot grow old together, leading to marriage and divorce, separation and reunion, with marital disputes constantly occurring and family tragedies frequently playing out. These are all problems that urgently need to be resolved. Expanding further, those who wish to govern their country must first regulate their family. If husband and wife are not in harmony, how can the family be regulated? Therefore, this is a major issue related to individual fortune and misfortune, as well as the rise and fall of the nation. Listing it as a course in universities, designating it as a subject to guide young men and women on how to pursue suitable partners, establish happy families, and avoid life's tragedies, and to enjoy sweet love, is truly extremely necessary! It can be asserted that students will definitely eagerly enroll and that their exam scores will be above eighty points.</p>
<h3>Gasperi</h3>
<p>— Dao Xian</p>
<p>Italian Prime Minister Gasperi was imprisoned twice by Mussolini before the war for leading the Christian Democratic Party. Later, he fled to the Vatican, working as a librarian with a monthly salary of eighty yuan. To supplement his income, he taught foreign languages and ghostwrote communications for foreign journalists.</p>
<p>During the war, he and his friends secretly returned to Italy, organizing guerrilla forces to resist the Nazis. In the 1946 election, much to his surprise, the Christian Democratic Party won eight million votes, becoming the largest party in Italy. Gasperi won again in this election, but he was much more nervous.</p>
<p>Gasperi lived a simple and plain life, residing in a small apartment. The furniture was the same set he had bought on installment when he was a librarian at the Vatican. He slept on a small hardwood bed. The only decorations on the white walls were a crucifix and an image of the Virgin Mary.</p>
<p>At the beginning of his term as Prime Minister, his first action was to draw an advance on his salary to buy a new blue suit. Gasperi was extremely frugal, often turning off unnecessary lights. His wife was a farm girl who bore him four daughters, one of whom married a butcher in Milan, and another became a nun.</p>
<p>Gasperi most admired experts. Surrounding him were many talented individuals who helped him counter the Italian Communist Party. Some say that Gasperi's greatest achievement in Europe today is that he governs the country without the "help" of the Communist Party.</p>
<h3>Ma Yongzhai</h3>
<p>— Qian Dacheng</p>
<p>Those who visit Yu Mountain in Changshu all know about Wang Si's Wine Shop, and also all know about Ma Yongzhai. Ma Yongzhai is a cooked meat shop. It has branches in both Shanghai and Suzhou, so it is especially famous far and wide. The owner of this shop is named Ma, and it was founded in the Qing Dynasty. His family used to live in Guli Village in the eastern countryside, and they were moderately wealthy, owning several acres of land. The people of Changshu have always placed great importance on their appetite, and his family was especially so, eventually losing all their wealth due to excessive eating. However, their culinary skills were thereby refined even further. When driven by hunger and cold, they placed their delicacies in a bamboo food basket (showing that he was also a scholar) and peddled them in teahouses and taverns (many impoverished households in Suzhou are doing this now). People tasted his food and greatly enjoyed it, calling his braised pork "Ma's Pork" and his braised chicken "Ma's Chicken," and only that made by his own hands could satisfy their appetite. His chicken floss and stewed chicken were especially his masterpieces (and there was also grass carp floss with an extremely exquisite taste, but it no longer exists now). What is called stewing involves first setting up a pot, placing several catties of vegetable oil and soy sauce in it, along with fennel and other fuels (the fuels and medicinal materials have a fixed formula). The oil is cooked until it is heated, and then a cooked chicken is placed in the pot overnight. The taste is extremely delicious, and the color is also yellow and tender. Pork, chicken, duck, eggs, dried tofu, etc., can also be placed in it. The older the pot, the better. The "Commentary to the Book of Han" suggests that 煼羊炙肉, sheep roasted with hot stone, is what we today know as stewing, is actually a speculative term, not worth believing. In a few years, the Ma family revived their family business, and then established Ma Yongzhai in front of the Xianri Temple. The storefront is extremely narrow and has remained unchanged for decades. However, his business is thriving. Locals give him local products as gifts when they go out, and outsiders who want to taste the famous products of Yu Mountain flock to this shop. Although other families tried their best to imitate him, with shops facing each other, and Long Yongzhai and Feng Yongzhai rising up one after another to compete with him, they ultimately could not match him. Every year, the number of chickens and ducks killed often reached tens of thousands. However, its taste is ultimately the most exquisite in the Changshu main store; the Suzhou and Shanghai branches inevitably cater to the tastes of the people there, losing their original authenticity. However, his family knew the taste of food, rose again after a setback, and actually became a wealthy family. He was indeed a hero of commerce!</p>
<h3>Little Raindrops</h3>
<p>— Shi Jimei</p>
<p>Confidence, love, and perseverance are the air, sunlight, and water of the tree of thought.</p>
<p>Beautiful peach blossoms, picked and placed in a vase for appreciation, adorn the spring in a warm room. In a few days, they wither and fade... even the most beautiful life comes to an end.</p>
<p>Unattractive flowers, unnoticed and unappreciated, turn into peaches on the tree.</p>
<p>"One day in heaven, a thousand years on earth." - This is the official listed price of the "time market." Life on earth is getting harder and harder. Now, I don't know how many billions of years it would take to exchange for one morning and evening in heaven?</p>
<p>Time is so precious, an hour is longer than a day, a day is longer than a year, and a year is longer than a lifetime...</p>
<p>We can clean up a decades-old, uninhabited house until it's spotless, but who can wipe away the dust in our memories? Even if that memory is from last night's dream, even if that dust is only a tiny speck.</p>
<h3>Talking About Inkstones</h3>
<p>— Ban Meng</p>
<p>Many people have talked about inkstones since ancient times. Li Zhiyan has "Inkstone Catalogue," Mi Nan Gong has "Inkstone History," Cao Jishan has "Inkstone Treatise," and in the late Qing Dynasty, Shi Yushan had "Gleanings from Inkstone Forest," and Ji Shouqiao had "Study of Duanxi Inkstone Pits." There are many inkstone treatises, too numerous to mention. While Duan inkstones are certainly excellent, there are also good ones from She inkstones, so one should not be rigid in one's assessment.</p>
<p>Duan inkstones began in the Wude era of the Tang Dynasty. By the Five Dynasties and early Song Dynasty, the southern and northern walls of the lower cliffs of Duanxi were discovered, with the northern part immersed in spring water and the southern part half-immersed. The northern stone was more moist and glossy, slightly better than the southern one. From the Zhiping era to the Xuanhe era, more and more stones were taken, and the walls were all hollowed out into caves, resulting in the differences between the upper, middle, and lower cliffs, and the divisions between the east, main, and west caves. During the Yuan Dynasty, they were closed off. During the Yongle and Xuande eras of the Ming Dynasty, they were opened and closed irregularly. In the late Chongzhen era, Xiong Wencan reopened a pit, and the stones obtained surpassed the Song Dynasty pits. In the late Qing Dynasty, all pits were unrestrictedly exploited, and even more stones were taken, but good stones were extremely rare. Those that have been passed down through generations and are famous are all old items, mostly regarded as superior if they can grind ink well and release ink well.</p>
<p>Those who collect inkstones distinguish the quality of the stone's color and luster based on its place of origin. The Longyan General Pit, the Lower Cliff Old Pit, the Water Cliff Old Pit, etc., all have good stones. During the Yongle era, the stones from the West Cave of the Water Cliff were considered fine, smooth, and good for grinding ink, so those who took them were unscrupulous, and the cave was hollowed out. Water Cliff stones do not have a purplish-red color like pig liver. The purple color has a faint white and light green hue. The purple color is dark in the center and light on the outside, either round like a coin or scattered in patches, commonly called "fire markings." The faint white parts are like smoke and clouds, without a fixed shape, commonly called "banana white." There are also patterns like green flowers and yellow dragons. In general, a good stone should be smooth, clear, and moist, and feel good to the touch, able to be distinguished in the dark.</p>
<p>Regarding inkstone eyes, it is especially necessary to distinguish between dead and alive eyes. If the eyes are not alive, they will be mixed with impurities and lack luster. Live eyes are black and white, bright and moist, with eight or nine layers of halos, clearly resembling pupils, and it is especially interesting if they seem to flow like water in the space between the eyebrow and forehead of the dragon on the inkstone. If the stones from Plum Blossom Pit, with bean-shaped eyes all over, are also not easy to obtain. Although the stone is from Duan, a new one is not good. Carving it into elaborate and symbolic shapes such as dragons, tigers, wind, clouds, three platforms, single pillar, figures, and landscapes is vulgar and lacks elegance, and it does not match the beauty of the stone's quality. Collectors especially do not take them.</p>
<p>As for the green flowers, if the dots are cluttered and mixed, they are not high-quality. Only those that float and sink on the surface of the stone, appearing and disappearing sparsely, and when viewed closely, resemble hair strands, mouse tracks, or fly wings, interspersed with delicate patterns, or resemble fine algae floating in streams, or resemble schools of fish swimming in water, or resemble dense autumn clouds, or resemble fine dust on the water surface, are all considered to be top-grade. There are many different types of stone patterns, such as fire markings, gold coins, iron markings, phoenix saliva, jadeite, king's belt, yellow dragon, gold threads, partridge spots, cinnabar spots, and ancient spots. It is difficult to distinguish them, and only those who are knowledgeable in this field can analyze them clearly.</p>
<p>Good inkstones are not limited to Duanxi. The Song Dynasty brush silk and luo-pattern inkstones are made of Shezhou jujube core pit stones, with different colors and beautiful workmanship, and were also praised in ancient times. My friend Chu Jianweng once collected a large round inkstone of Mr. Dongpo, about two feet in diameter, engraved with many handwritten works of Dongpo. The stone was not from Duanxi, but seemed to be from She. After the bandit rebellion, I don't know if it still exists. For us inkstone users, the ability to grind ink is the most important thing. What the surface pattern is like is a matter for inkstone collectors and can be ignored. As for inscriptions by famous people and carvings by skilled craftsmen, although extremely exquisite, they have nothing to do with those who cultivate inkstone fields. Recently, the owner of Ling Xiaohan Pavilion obtained an ancient inkstone, with powerful calligraphy on the side inscriptions, but it is not known what era it is from, and it is still under investigation.

<h3>Distant Sacrifice to Deceased Parents</h3>
<p>— Shi Shufan</p>
<p>In life, suffering, never known joy,</p>
<p>In death, still difficult to find earth's rest,</p>
<p>Old eyes, at the end, son not there to see,</p>
<p>Thick frost, drifting on the coffin, bones long cold;</p>
<p>Two weeks' time, swallowed sobs remembered,</p>
<p>One mournful cry in the dark, supporting dreams to see,</p>
<p>Mother and child's bond, what lifetime to continue?</p>
<p>Paper ashes burned in the sea, the sea should run dry.</p>
<p>Wandering flesh and blood, begging for compassion,</p>
<p>Thin hemp clothes, not yet able to wear,</p>
<p>Since sharing tears with the orphaned crow, ending the year,</p>
<p>Expected no Laba porridge to offer before the spirit,</p>
<p>The closing of the coffin seals thoughts of a son's tears,</p>
<p>Riding the moon, one should ascend the tomb-sweeping boat,</p>
<p>Heartrending, this heart beating inside the drum,</p>
<p>Gazing afar, what year will bring a homecoming sacrifice?</p>
<p>Bearing a son like me, death's eyes won't close,</p>
<p>Funeral palace, not yet swept, still floating duckweed,</p>
<p>Three years without a mother, still doubting it's a dream,</p>
<p>One offering of incense, can there be a spirit!</p>
<p>Butchering dogs, can I forget that day's oath?</p>
<p>Holding ice, how to wash away the homeland's stench?</p>
<p>Renting a knife to buy a horse, poverty hard to remedy,</p>
<p>How dare I say returning banners marked on the grave.</p>
<p>Son's strength, though exhausted, blood still red,</p>
<p>Son's heart, extremely bitter, for insignificant loyalty,</p>
<p>Originally knowing not burying is a crime against heaven,</p>
<p>Already driven to selling writing, carving bone poor!</p>
<p>Sons and brothers calling three times, finally recognizing me,</p>
<p>River washing ten thousand folds, must return east,</p>
<p>Before spring, sacrificing and telling of the winter's snow,</p>
<p>First donning hemp clothes, bowing in the snow. A Youth</p>
<h3>Socrates' Little House</h3>
<p>— A Youth</p>
<p>The great Greek philosopher Socrates once built a small house, which everyone found very strange. His neighbor asked him:</p>
<p>"Master, your name is known throughout the world, why build a small house like a pigeon coop to live in?"</p>
<p>Socrates said: "There may be no particular reason. But although this house is small, if I can fill it with good friends, I will be very happy."</p>
<p>— Friends all over the world, how many are truly close?</p>
<h3>Talking About Cocktail Parties</h3>
<p>— Ji Mo</p>
<p>The American cocktail party was originally a small chat among friends before dinner, but now it has become an indispensable ritual for promoting a new movie star or selling a certain cosmetic or a new model of car.</p>
<p>Among the millions of residents of New York, perhaps only a few thousand regularly attend cocktail parties, and among these few thousand, some attend one or two parties every day, including columnists, beauty and fashion magazine editors, and journalists.</p>
<p>Relatively important cocktail parties in New York City all have a specific purpose, such as introducing a movie star who has come to New York, introducing a new film being released, introducing newly made fashions, and publishing a new book. The scale of these cocktail parties varies, from borrowing a small room in a hotel with fifty or sixty attendees to renting a large and luxurious dance floor with perhaps hundreds of attendees.</p>
<p>The circumstances of cocktail parties are roughly similar. Three or five people gather to talk, lowering their voices to show their politeness. When eating, they also take small bites and stop, unlike those who eat as much as they can in restaurants.</p>
<p>Cocktail parties also have several rules. One of them is to avoid talking to the honored guests who are invited as much as possible. Some people who regularly attend cocktail parties have never spoken to those honored guests for many years.</p>
<p>Literary cocktail parties are highly valued. The gentlemen and ladies attending hold teacups, chat and laugh, and witty remarks are made frequently. Attendees include publishers, writers, and the usual guests found at cocktail parties. They sip cocktails and exchange mundane matters of daily life.</p>
<p>Nowadays, almost every business leader in America has discovered that hosting cocktail parties is an excellent way to connect and promote themselves to the outside world. There are all kinds of parties that introduce kitchen equipment, electric refrigerators, or jewelry. As for parties that introduce fashion and beauty products, they are held every day. Industrial designers also display sculpted products at cocktail parties, accompanied by music and explanations from experts, elaborating on the product's characteristics and advantages.</p>
<p>The expenses of cocktail parties often deter many people. In most cases, the hotel room is provided free of charge, and the host only needs to pay for the alcohol and food. As for the Waldorf Hotel, which holds about twenty cocktail parties every week, and the Stork and St. Regis Hotels, which have two or three cocktail "parties" every day, their prices depend on the host's desire to be extravagant and the amount consumed by the guests.</p>
<p>Cocktails cost between 55 and 88 cents per glass. Sandwiches and snacks cost between one and one and a half dollars per serving. For five dollars, you can eat turkey, ham, or other hot dishes placed in a mobile glass cabinet.</p>
<p>On average, each guest has to spend three dollars or more to hold a cocktail party. Not long ago, a certain person from California booked a banquet at the Waldorf Hotel, insisting that famous singers such as so-and-so sing, costing a total of three thousand dollars. He also ordered various flowers, costing two thousand dollars. He set up two types of bars at the cocktail party: a champagne bar and a mixed drink bar. Expensive caviar was also served to the honored guests. This time, he entertained one hundred and three friends, costing a total of ten thousand dollars. Ordinary cocktail parties, however, cost about a thousand dollars.</p>
