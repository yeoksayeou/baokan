<h3 id="c1">蔣總統以國民資格發起勤儉建國運動　廣播號召全國軍民一致奮起推行　改革社會解除兩大威脅 <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>〔本報南京十五日電〕總統十五日晚九時廣播演說，號召全國軍民團行勤儉建國運動，以配合前次公布之財政經濟緊急處分令之實施，而爲社會改革之發靱，勤儉建國運動綱領係由黃少谷，彭昭賢，谷正綱等草擬，總統對此極爲重視，故決定以廣播方式發表，惟總統公務忙迫，十五日下午四時由中央廣播電台派員赴北極閣為總統錄音，九時廣播時，全國軍民均得恭聆總統剴切懇擊之指示。</p>
<p>〔中央社南京十五日電〕蔣總統以國民一分十之資終，發起動儉建國運動，並於十五日晚九時在中央廣播電台，對全國同胞播講勤儉建國運動綱領，茲誌原文如下：</p>
<p>今天我們中國最迫切的要求，是解除人民的痛苦和安定社會的秩序，為要達成這個目的，首先就要戡平奸黨共匪的叛亂，加速剿匪戰事的勝利，這是我們全國同胞人人一致的願望，也是我們全國同胞人人共同的責任。因之，我們全國同胞必須認識這個責任的重大，更要認識這個使命的艱鉅，務須全國一致咬緊牙關，鼓起勇氣，同心同德，克勤克儉，來克服我們國民革命這個最後的難關，達到我們共同的目的。</p>
<p>同胞們，大家還要知道，我國民族的大難，建國的大敵，不僅在奸匪作祟，民生凋敝，而還在寄生階級的投機操縱，荒淫無度，尤其是剝削分子的自私自利，浪費奢侈，墜落腐敗，以致影響全國的民心，造成社會的不平，古語說：「勤儉為立身之本」，西諺亦說：「奢侈是建國的大敵」。我們必須能先克服這個內在的大敵，戒除奢侈，消滅腐敗，崇尙節約，積極建設，而後剿匪戡亂工作方能使之澈底完成，所以中正今日特以國民的資格，來發起勤儉建國運動，並擬訂運動綱要，期以社會的共流，來冲刷社會的渣滓，奠定戡亂勝利建國成功的基礎，熱望我全國同胞一致奮起，來推進這一個連動，厲行這一個綱要，完成大家戡亂建國的使命。</p>
<p>勤儉建國運動綱要</p>
<p>（一）勵儉建國運動的要旨　中國對日抗戰勝利以後，又遭遇了兩大威脅，一是奸黨共匪暴力集團的全面叛亂，一是由奸匪叛亂所造成的經濟殘破與社會不平，這兩大威脅能否解除，將決定我們新中國建設的成敗，乃至中華民族存亡的命運。</p>
<p>今天全國愛國軍民同胞，正在與國家民族的公敵—賣國奸匪進行着決生死的搏鬥，大多數在饑餓綫上掙扎的人民出錢出力，流血流汗，來支持戡亂救國的戰爭，而若干不勞動不生產的寄生階級，以及囤積操縱，與用盡一切非法手段攫得財富的投機份子，則窮奢極侈，過着荒淫無度的生活，他們不但破壞了國家的生產力，而且造成一種社會腐敗的頹風，影響了全國的民心和戡亂的士氣。</p>
<p>為了矯正這種不合理的現象，為了澈匠實行總體戰，集中全國人力·財力·物力，發揮高度的效能，以保證戡亂的勝利與建國的成功，我們不能不喚醒社會寄生階級和投機份子的自覺自制，從「勤儉」二字痛下功夫、，革除怠惰荒淫的惡習，向勤勞大衆共同努力，滑加生產，節約消費報效國家，克盡國民的天職。這就是我們發起動儉盡國運動的要旨。這個運動，不僅是轉移風氣，改革社會的起點，而且是戡亂建國總動員工作的一環，在這個運動的旗幟之下，我們希望大家做到以下兩點：「把公私生活的消費，節約到最低限度」，「把工作生產與作戰力量，發揮到最高程度」。</p>
<h3 id="c2">前方生活士兵化後方生活平民化　保證戡亂建國事業成功 <a href="#c2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>運動使命</p>
<p>（二）勤憸建國運動的使命</p>
<p>勤儉建國運動，就是國民革命在現階段的實踐，它的歷史使命，是號召一切愛國之士，共同發揚自立·自助·自强·自制的精神，實踐勤勞刻苦的生活，並以勸導·感化及服務的方式推已及人，使社會形成自發·自制的約束力，來糾正貧富生活兩極化的傾向，以期逐漸達到前方生活士兵化和後方生活平民化的鵠的。</p>
<p>在經濟上，動儉建國運動是要使整個社會由於生活的克制，消費的節約，得以掃除享受的過分不平。由於勞動的普及，效能的提高，得以達到生產的逐漸增加，卽一面使我國民生活方式與臘民經濟能力相協調，防止當商巨賈豪紳顯宦物質生活的揮霍無度，一面鼓勵勞動，加强生產，發展國家經濟建設及蓄積國防建設的潛力，尤其在目前由於浪費的戒絕，可以收到穩定物價，鞏固幣値，平衡國際收支的效果。</p>
<p>在政治上，動儉建國運動是要以區行勤勞生產與刻苦生活，作為根絕貪污，提高效率的有效手段，尤其要澈底實施總體戰，儘量使全國人力·財力·物力配合軍事的需要，以加强國軍的戰鬥力，早日戡平內亂。同時，在前方，生活士兵化，後方生活平民化的目標之下，使軍與民，將與兵·官與民·貧與富因生活水準的接近，而促成心理上的團結，行動上的一致，使全國上下結合，成一個堅强的戰鬥體，以保證戡亂建國事業的成功。</p>
<p>十項公約</p>
<p>（三）勤儉建國運動公約</p>
<p>我們為了貿踐並推廣勤儉建國運動，特訂公約十項，懸為共同目標，凡參加這個運動的人，必須遵守和力行這個公約，（一）積極工作，積極建設。（二）遵守時閒，遵守秩序。（三）消滅腐敗，消減貪污。（四）戒除奢侈，戒除浪費。（五）生活平等，法律平等。（六）剿匪第一，建國第一。（七）一切為前綫，一切為生產。（八）前方生活士兵化，後方生活平民化。（九）敬重官兵，為軍隊服務。（十）愛護農工，為社會服務。</p>

<p>五，輔導難民就業，發展生產工作：（一）難民游民及失業勞工聚集後方，巨大的勞動力無處使用，而物資的消耗反成為國家戡亂時期的沉重負祖，需要發動社會力量，加以輔導，使無業者就業，失業者復業，從事於不正當職業者轉移於有利國防與民生的職業部門，使社會的消費力轉變為生產力。（二）勸導人民投資於有益國計民生的生產事業，如購買國營公營事業股票或經營工礦，以利用游資，發動社會力量，開辦工廠或農塲，提倡築路，造林，墾殖，修渠，改良環境衛生及各種建設工作，實行以工代賑，寓救濟於生產，以吸收剩餘的社會勞動力，使建國工作逐步展開。</p>

<p>普遍節約</p>
<p>關於厲行節約方面</p>
<p>一，公物使用及汽油消耗節約：（一）節省公物私用。（二）嚴格實行汽油配給。（三）减少小座車，增加公共汽車。</p>
<p>二，人力使用節約：（一）提倡機關·團體·公司……節用人力，栽汰冗員。（二）提倡機關及住宅：：裁减警衛·工役及僕從數額。</p>
<p>三，飲食消費節約：（一）糧食節約。（二）烟酒糧食消費節約。（三）提倡限制肉類費　及消費節約。</p>

<p>七，摒除不正當娛樂：（一）不進營業性舞塲。（二）提倡正堂娛樂，並勸導戒除嫖賭及一切不良嗜好。（三）主張從重徵收奢侈行為捐稅，富禁於徵。</p>
<p>八，發展各種生產消費合作事業，期達物資調節與分配合理化的目的。註一，右列各項係以首先推行勤儉建國運動的大都市為目標，擴大推行範圍時，應另訂適合於當時實際情况與需要的實踐項目。註二，右列各項，一面須由政府以法令推行，一面分由勤儉建國力行團分別擬具配合法令的具體辦法，發動社會民主力量，協力推行。</p>
<h3 id="c3">張羣晉謁蔣總統　王外長往訪長談兩小時 <a href="#c3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>〔本報南京十五日電〕前行政院長張羣訪日返國，十五日七時十分由滬抵京，記者於車站訪晤張氏，請略談訪日觀感。張氏首卽宣稱無新聞，渠所携歸之資料甚多，俟整理後卽可發表，惟大部意見已於渠離日前夕在日廣播，記者訽以是否有一遊東南亞各國之計劃？張氏稱：戰後東南亞各新與國家吾人應對其有所瞭解，個人自願作此訪問，惟尙未決定此行之計劃。張氏對日本間題未作一詞，旋卽與歡迎者寒暄登車返邸，稍事休息後，外長王世杰卽往訪，長談達兩小時。午赴北極閣晋謁總統，並進午餐，同往者有王世杰等。張氏卽將訪日所得略呈重點，席間並就對日問題有所商談，總統於聆悉報告後，亦有所指示。</p>
<h3 id="c4">革命性社會運動必須有堅强組織　先自京滬着手以爲示範 <a href="#c4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>（五）勸儉建國運動的組織</p>
<p>一，勤儉建國運動，是革命性的社會運動，必須有計劃，有堅强的組織，負推行之責，而這個組織必須是一種自發自動的人民組織。</p>
<p>二，為求組織健全而有力量，必須採取逐步擴展的方式，分期的組織工作，應先從京。滬及各大都市着手，以為示範。俟有成一效，然後漸次推及其他地區。</p>
<p>三，每一地區在建立組織之前，應本「以行動爲號召」之原則，進行普遍而有效的宣傳工作，並須經過充分而有計劃的籌備階段，籌備工作的進行，應自中央而地方，負責籌備人員必須具備「以身作則之條件和克已服務之精神」</p>
<p>四，勤儉建國運動應有健全之基本組織，以為達成本運動各項任務的基本力量，每一基本組織的人數，不宜超過十五人，以期聯繫確實，行動靈活。</p>
<p>五，凡誓行動儉建國運動公約適合規定標準的社會人士，都可以參如勤儉建國運動的組織，但必須先參加其基本組織，而且是自願的，並須具有身體力行的決心和本身勤儉行爲的保證。在組織發展過程中，負責人員應謹守「寗缺母濫的原則，組織中如發現建長公約的份子，經證實後，必須予以處分，清除內部僞裝的腐化份子和招搖的投機份子，保證組織的純潔性。</p>
<p>六，組織的每一個成員均須經當自我檢討，互相監督，共同勉勵，不獨自已要躬行寳踐，同時一要起領導作用，擴大影響，尤須鼓勵合於規定標準之親友踴躍參加組織，使本運動爲幅射性的發展。</p>
<p>七，基本組織，除在地區進行外，並應在各工廠，商店，學校，部隊，機關，社團和職業團體中普遍進行，同一地區或部門中有若干基本組織時，應聯合建立聯繫組織，以加强本運動的基層工作。</p>
<p>八，同一地區內是的組織工作達到相當程度時，卽建立該地區之中心組織，以領導該地區勤儉建國運動的推行。</p>
<p>九，勤儉建國運動組織的中樞，應設於首都所在地，担負領導全國各級組織推進本運動之全責。</p>
<p>宣傳推動</p>
<p>（大）勤儉建國運動的推行。</p>
<p>一，在勤儉建國運動展開之前，應發動普遍深入的宣傳，使大多數人民了解這是消除不平的革命的社會運動，了解這一運動和人民自已的切身利害關係，燃燒起迎接這一運動的熱情。</p>
<p>二，熱烈歡迎勤勞大衆加入組織，以充實勤儉建國運動，給勤勞大衆以榮譽和精神上的鼓勵，使其發生示範作用，並使他們由於參加這個運動，而形成一種有組織的道義力量，尤其要讓他們一有權批評檢舉任何懶惰奢侈份子一，發揮道義制栽的偉大作用。</p>
<p>三，勤儉建國運動和政府的戡一亂建國動員的措施，改革幣制管一理經濟金融的方案以及肅淸賞污一，澄淸吏治的法令，必須密切地一聯繫配合，使自動的覺悟反省與被動的勸導强制相輔而行。</p>
<p>四，為配合勞苦大衆撿舉批評社會上怠惰奢侈份子的行動，應發動全國興論界，繼續不斷地予遠反勤儉建國運動公約者以制栽，並在報紙或廣播電台宣布這些份十的姓名和奢侈浪費的事實，掛成一種新風氣，使一般人民認為過度的奢侈和享受是一種不光榮的行為。同時，應竭力贊揚那些廉潔勤勞的文武官吏，節約樓實的士紳與文化·敎育和工商界人士，給他們以精神上的鼓勵安慰，以期在社會上發生轉移風氣的作用。</p>
<p>五，對於工作對象客觀環境以及可能遭遜的限力，必須作正確的估計，因不同的職業，不同的階層，不同的生活條件定出每一項工作進行的步驟，計劃與內容，卽必須因人·因事·因時·因地而制止，所有方案均須具體可行，乃至標語口號亦必須高於現實性，萬不可成爲官樣文章與交卷主義，辦不到的事情，不輕率地開始，但已決定要推動的工作，則必須集中一切力量，排除一切困難，貫澈到底。</p>
<p>六，時時刻刻檢討研究，從工作中獲取寶貴的經驗，糾正已經犯過的錯誤，切實把握勤儉建國運動的正確性，務以毅力·恒心·熱情，使這個偉大的運動能深入普及與持久。（完）</p>

<p>韓國總統李承晚博士所遺聘問中菲美特使團，趙特使炳玉等一行，本月九日啟程，十一日經日本飛抵上海，翌晨到達南京，謁蔣總統致敬，十四日回滬，昨日備受本市各界之歡迎，今午卽將飛菲聘問。我們聽了昨天趙特使在歡迎茶會席上之演詞，深有所威·今姑拉雜寫　，作為臨別的贈言。</p>
<p>誠如趙特使所丟，「今日國際共產主義之膨脹，使大韓民國之成立困難重重。」豈獨韓國如是？就是兩三年來，中國人民在擊敗便略的日寇而後，尙不能享受勝利之果，烽火瀰天，災鴻遍野，也何嘗不是國際共產主義膨脹之所賜？國際共產主義之所以與國家之獨立有牴觸者，與其說是由於共產主義，還不如說由於其全受共產國際之指揮。在共產國際指揮之下，中國固為其膨脹勢力理想中之廣塲，而韓國則更為其與民主國家逐鹿遠東之前哨陣地。故大韓民國成立之日，北韓卽在蘇聯卵翼之下另組其割擾一方之政府。這顯然障礙着韓國之統一，而有使韓國將來成為遠東火藥庫之危險。特使團此次出國聘問，固意在答謝三國，而其眞正的任務，要在「聯合全世界愛好和平之人士，完成韓國之獨立統一，」此則趙特使昨已明言，我們深願其此行之成功。此其一，</p>
<p>中韓兩國，素為兄弟之弗，數千年來，情感彌篤·韓國與中國相處二三千年而常存，與日本相處不及二三十年而被併。韓國人民身受亡國之痛者近四十年，大戰而後，因盟國實踐開羅宣言而得以早日組成政府，宣告獨立·吾爾國人民為韓國深致慶幸之餘，必能體味到日本以前軍閥帝國主義之如何擾亂這東和平。為懲前毖從之計，中韓兩國人民必須永久眞誠携手，堅强團結，以預防日本侵略關勢力之再起。所謂日本侵略勢力，不僅武力而已，其侵略的經濟集團，以及侵略的思想根源，都應該在痛切剷除之列。聽說日本全國上下，正在臥薪嘗膽，陰謀捲士重來，而主持盟總管制的美國當局又未必能洞見日本人的肺肝，一旦縱容過甚，必有重起為患之慮。中韓兩國自應共同負責，用眞誠的呼號，促起若干美國當局的注意，而改正其為日本軍閥官僚乃至婦女所蒙蔽的錯誤觀念·誠以盟總大權旣在美國手中，特使團此行赴美，自當竭其所能，正告美國朝野，勿再逾分縱容日本軍閥財閥的遺華，重留火種於東亞。此其二。</p>
<p>韓國總統李承晚博士，為其祖國獨立，畢生奮鬥，始終不懈，去年四月，由美回國，道經上海，所留給上海人士的印像，他不但是一位革命的政治家，而且是書有漢學修養的學者。李博士雖旅美甚久，而深通中國古文辭，故其秉性重然諾，守正義，而不拘於功利之說，不迷於唯物之論。他用中國筆，寫得一手好字，吟得一口好詩，與吾中國人民誠如兄弟。此次特使團以趙炳玉博士冠其首，趙特使為李總統之擊友，也背熟一口好詩，寫得一手好字。他們對中國情誼之篤，先從如為一人。我們今天在此深深為特使團惜別·願諸君於赴菲赴美達成任務之後，　譽歸來，重經我國，我們更將盡地主之誼，多請諸君盤桓於中國名勝之地，流達歌咏，涵育於數千年來源遠流長之中國文化之氛圍中，更增强其愛好和平之信心，相與戮力於維護世界之和平，則此行庶幾其不虛。此其三。</p>
<p>萬里梯航，驅歌遽唱，敬祝韓國特使團旅途安吉，使命成功！</p>

<p>〔法國新聞社巴黎十五日電〕四國代表今日舉行最後一次會購時，通過致聯合國秘書長賴依之函件。　函之目的，係在通知賴依謂四强會議決定將有關前義大利殖民地問題移交聯合國大會處理，該項文件係以法文撰成，由四强代表團團長簽名於下。同時四强會議又決將調查委員會之報告書，及倫敦外長代表會議之建議，一併送達聯合國。</p>
<p>〔合衆社巴黎十五日電〕義大利戰前在非洲殖民地，即利比亞·索馬里蘭及伊利特里亞之處置問題已於十五日移交聯合國辦理。由於四强代表至十五日中午（巴黎時間））仍未獲協讓，該問題即自動成為聯合國大會之問題。四强討論中，蘇代表維辛斯基突然提出新建議，主張將各地交付聯合國託管，按前時蘇聯力主殖民地交還義大利。一九四六年美國務卿貝爾納斯曾主張聯合國託管養屬地，此次蘇聯全部照抄提出，（按根據貝爾納斯之議，將設置聯合國之顧問會，其中包括四强代表及當地居民之代表，因此蘇聯在義屬非洲可有發言權。）蘇聯政策之轉變，使西方國家代表均為之震驚。英國稱自始至終反對該計劃，美國則無表示。蘇聯之建議在程序辯論中無疾而終，結果時限到臨，四强仍意見分歧。義大利和約規定該問題在移交聯合國前有一年時間可供四外長會議決定，然四外長會議歷次會談迄無協議。</p>

<p>〔本報訓〕市參議會第七次大會，昨午四時起，在塘沽路會所舉行第五次會議，由潘議長主席，出席參議員一四〇人，列席吳市長暨各局處長二十餘人，本市經濟督導員蔣經國，昨亦以來賓資格，出席致詞。會中討論社會，市府施政，市長交議，議長交議，及臨時動議等各項提案·會畢，休息十分鐘後，卽舉行閉幕儀式，至七時半圓滿結束。</p>
<p>潘議長致閉幕詞，略稱：第七次大會得以如此寗靜順利，本席認為原因不在本會本身，而在整個社會。因為在會前及會間，上海已進入安定狀態，這是指物價的平穩。這一點，是値得令人欣慰的。</p>
<p>這一次的參議會大會，例應在十月召開，所以提前舉行者，係由於市府催請，因爲六·七兩月來，市財政已臨最大難關，幾至無錢修路，無法運垃圾之困境。自中央頒布新經濟措施方案後，市府之新預算，及房捐與市政建設捐之調整，均待本會研討通過，這也是本次大會最重要的案件。是案曾經財政小組審查委會等數度審查研討，通過房捐與市政建設捐合併徵收，其稅率較諸戰前舊工部局及法公董局時代已抑低甚多，較市府原定之調率亦已核减，則自問確在市民負担及市府開支雙方兼顧之下決定的。此外本次大會又通過簡化稽徵手續案，亦已替市府節省不少人力物力，使市府今後得以勉强維持。</p>
<p>目前上海物價之能穩定，全仰蔣督導員之領導有方，及本市軍警機關的合作得力，同時亦是由於全市人民的擁護政府，中央銀行兌換金鈔的龐大數額卽足證明。最近的上海，在官民眞誠合作之下，確足以自豪，値得作為全國的表率，當我們聽到各地喊出「向上海看齊！」「向上海學習！」的口號時，可以看出上海是何等重要。希望蔣總統，切實領導人民與政府密切合作，我們擁護蔣總統頒佈之新經濟方案，向目的地邁進。參議會願鼓勵市民，共渡難關，朝着同一方向，貫澈新經濟方案的賓施。</p>
<h3 id="c60">市長指出參會當前兩重任務今後主要工作當爲穩定物價 <a href="#c60" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e60" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">60</a></h3>
<p>議長詞畢，卽由吳市長致詞略稱：本人認為參議會當前有二重任務，一是平衡市府收支，一為協助中央穩定物價。平衡預算方面，此次經參議會協助，在雙方兼顧下，通過重編市預算業已達到目的，本人認此次決定實是合情合理。戰前本市侮年度預算計四千六百萬元，計合金圓九千二百萬元，目下市預算僅五千萬元，且人口已較前增加二百萬，應請市民瞭解，因參議會確已顧到市民負担能力。後主要工作當為保持物價之穩定，如物價再有波動，則此次通過之市預算又等於白費，希望各界合作，謀社會之永久安定。</p>
<h3 id="c61">蔣督導員致詞　從紊亂到安定必須經過犧牲　一切尚須參議員合作協助 <a href="#c61" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e61" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">61</a></h3>
<p>旋由蔣督導員以來賓資格，致詞略稱：本人此次奉命在俞總裁領導之下，來滬督導幣制改革及穩定物價工作，奉命之初有兩個感覺：（一）能有機會與上海同胞共同生活合作，興奮異常。（二）惟以年輕識淺，膺此重任，惶恐萬狀。但三星期以來，我已獲得最大的敎訓：凡事只要和人民在一起，不會失敗，只有成功，三週來的經驗，加强了必能成功的信心。目前上海物價的得以穩定，實為本市全體市民赤誠擁護政府之表現，亦是參議會及市政當局領導人民的功勞，本人非常感謝。目下尙為吾人工作之開始，來日困難正多，惟深信只要各界合作，誠誠懇懇，切切實實的做去，一切困難皆能克服！目前最希望的，是本市同胞及商人千萬不要再存觀望態度。今後對於執行政府法令均有明確之標準尺度，商人之孰善孰奸，均可運用此一尺度衡量，合法者當予保障，不法者均將嚴處，絕無私心偏見。回憶本人在江西服務時，第一個遭檐斃之凟職公務員，即隨本人工作四五年之老部下，本人並非無私人情感，惟為了國家，為了人民，不得不如此做！今後的工作，在乎發展工商業，因為消極的抑平物價不能持久，扶助工商業才能求得安定。但是從紊亂轉變到安定，必須經過犧牲，暫時的不景氣是過渡時期所不能免的，這可以以火災來作譬喻。起火時雖然我的房屋並未延及，但為什麼要遭拆坍，是為保全數十數百幢人家的房屋而犧牲。所以我們要眼光放得遠，如果只有今天沒有將來，犧牲自然是白費了。此番本人來滬執行國策，始終抱定不變之觀念，卽澈底執行已定政策，求其合理，合法，合情，同時積極努力於穩定物價，協助工商業之發展，一切尙須參議負諸君之合作協助，俾共渡艱苦難關，貫澈目標。</p>
<p>最後由徐副議長代表全體參議員致答詞，希望蔣督導對正當之工商界今後如有原料上，生產成本上發生困難時，能予協助，俾同謀社會之安定，至七時半圓滿閉幕。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕股票商林樂耕及杜維屏，陶李國蘭，徐楊淑瑤等，前經地檢處以違反交易所法罪嫌，提起公訴，地方法院昨日下午二時，由沈天保庭長，梅爾和及方祥海兩推事，在該院第二庭開合議庭，初度審理。被告杜維　在庭供述兩點：其一，渠所開設之鴻興證劵號及華美工業貿易公司，分別聘請邱雲峰，孫樹人兩人，經管內外業務，兩處事無鉅細，均信賴兩人全權處理，渠本人平日素不到號過問，僅由兩人報告號內盈虧而已。且在八月十一日至二十日間，渠之腿部生瘡臥病在家，有醫證明，更未一至號內。渠對於業中情形，向不熟悉，並曾令邱某不許做塲外交易。與林樂耕，李國蘭，楊淑瑤等素不相議。其二：地檢處起訴書內載稱，渠自八月十六日開始，陸續經營塲外交易，拋售大量股票，渠已在市警察局訊問時，共認不諱一節，完全不確。本月二日渠應市警察局傳訊時，因渠素不熟悉號內營業情形故，乃自勳命邱雲峰陪同到局應訊，渠在局供稱：「號內情形，我全不知道，請問邱先生」。警局口供筆錄，對於渠及邱之供詞，未加區別，均在供詞上冠以「杜答，供後亦未經渠過目，且事後獲悉，對原供詞，頗有塗改之處，自不能就此認係渠之口供。杜末供稱：請庭上對本案詳加調查，我如是犯法，應該受懲，否則，請依司法獨立精神，秉公辦理。</p>

<p>昨日開庭時，各被告家屬親友，到庭旁聽者約五百餘人，庭內容納百餘人，已座無虛席，餘均列於扶梯上下，後至者則在院內空地觀望。地院派法警多人，在塲維持秩序。各被告於正午由馬斯南路地院第一看守所乘車提到，開審前暫於第二庭待質室休息。杜林均著灰色網衫，杜腿疾尙未全愈，行動稍感不便，惟其面容鎭靜，一如往昔。陶李國蘭，身健胖，衣白底碎紅花之綢質旗袍，在庭四處張望，若無其事。徐楊海瑤，瘦弱似不禁風，黑總旗袍之外，眾以淡黃毛衣，愁眉沉思，顯得十分憂戚。二時正開庭，各被告依次面向庭上，中外攝影記者，紛紛拍取鏡頭。中電並派員拍攝新聞片，地院以向無前例，拍至中途受阻而退</p>
<p>改幣消息俱稱未息</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕本市九江路證劵大樓四一二室第一九〇號經紀人溧陽人呂濂敬，素來經營塲外交易，而為警備司令部稽查人員所注意。本年七月五日（星期一），警備部所派監視證劵市塲人員至四一二室內巡查時，適有自稱廣新銀行周傳林（卽周壽林）問永紗股票塲外價格，並稱有客戶須售出永紗股票一百萬股。當由該巡查員答稱，願出六千五百元買進，（按紗廠當日漲停板價僅六千三百元），周表示願照價賣出。其時又適逢該號經理林樂耕亦來電話，仍中該巡查員偽充該號職員接聽，告以前項交易是否接受，林答可以照收，并謂塲外利息做三七四元至三八〇元云云。警備部以呂等經營塲外交易屬實，乃報請財政部上海證券交易所監理員辦公處，轉呈財部及工商部飭令吊銷營業執照，抄錄證明函件，移解地檢處偵查。又據林樂耕當庭供稱：「杜維解，呌他的經理邱雲峯到四一二室來時我出售永紗一六〇〇萬股，亦是委託我們號裏去出售的」等語，再與呂·周等人口供互相印證，各被告確有塲外交易事實，案級偵查終結，其中除林樂耕部份已另案起訴外，對呂·周·邱三人以違反交易所法，提起公訴。</p>
<p>美拋出。李供、伊與楊淑瑤與華美向有往來，先開有戶頭，故至華美轉請鴻興拋出。是日原是無意而去，不意竟因此肇禍。庭上追詢據調查十九日上午七時，有兩女人在華美等候至開門時，卽進內拋股，「是否卽是你們兩人」。李笑供：「世間絕無此傻子」。</p>
<p>徐楊淑瑤糊塗犯罪</p>
<p>最後由徐楊淑瑤答供：與徐莊懷結婚五年，以前不做股票生意，八一九上午九時半，因李國蘭之邀，同往華美，至則門已洞開，先拋一百萬股，後因看跌，又拋一百萬股。以前與林杜等不認識，丈夫於八月十四日到滬一次，未告任何改革幣制消息。未供：「我不懂做股票生意，李國閘約我，我卽跟去，就這樣糊襄糊塗犯了罪，不知是怎麼一會事。」庭上繼傳訊證人邱雲峰，胡增達（前者係鴻興證券號經理，後者為該號職員），二人均未到庭，旋由各被告辯護律師相繼辯論，庭上以證人未到庭，諭令改期，責令被告律師於下次開庭時，將證人邱雲峰，胡增達，及孫樹人三人傳到供質，各被告並可提充分證據。林樂耕，陶李國蘭，徐楊淑瑤三人，請求交保未准</p>

<p>— 本報特派記者　淩松壽</p>
<p>自從抗織初期，花園口黃河決口，阻止了敵人西進以後，河南人有句口頭韓，那就是「功在國家，禍在地方。」說到河南人苦，都少不了提及這兩句話。自然，在今天戡亂的局面下，中原已經燃燒起無邊的烽火，而成為一個其有決定性的主要戰塲，河南人當然又在「功在國家，禍在地方」的熊勢下，義不答辭地挑起了這付神聖而又沉重的祖子了！</p>
<p>關心中原戰局的人們，一定會淸楚今天河南省境內究竟能控制幾個點，然而除去河南人而外，人們却永遠不會淸楚今天在道一點一綫的政府控制區城裏面，河南人要負担多少糧，多少役，多少攤派？</p>
<p>拿鄭州來說，從去年十一日起到今年六月止，假手於鄭州縣政府而取之於鄭州老百姓的東西如下：</p>
<p>徵購軍公糧二千九百十六萬四千八百四十二斤。</p>
<p>代購柴草一千五百八十八萬四千三百七十四斤。</p>
<p>代購麩料四百四十五萬五千六百六十五斤。</p>
<p>代徵大車一千七百二十二輛。</p>
<p>價購靑磚九百三十一萬塊。</p>
<p>價購石灰五百六十四萬一千斤</p>
<p>價購圓木七萬一千二百三十一根。</p>
<p>價購木板二千一百三十三方。</p>
<p>代借傢具五千一百十件。</p>
<p>（以上各項賠償計三萬三千三百五十一億二千三百四十八萬元）。</p>
<p>上面所列的購價數字三萬三千餘億，還是按兩個多月前的價格計算，現在算起來，少不得又要加上若干倍。</p>
<p>這些糧或款，當然都是攤到民間去。商店方面，普通的店面　一個月都得攤上幾石糧，多的十多石幾十石不等。田畝方面，在鄭州鄉村中侮畝每年的產糧，約在一百五十斤到二百斤，一年的收穫，一次攤派就完全報效。鄭州現在是孤島，商店在一個月中能做幾多生意？在這種情况下，商店算是走到末路，民國三十五年鄭州有二千多家舖子，現在只剩下了四分之一都不足。田地呢？終年辛苦，結果還要賠錢，誰還做這個傻瓜，旣賣不掉，只有任他荒去，人到別處想辦法生活，所以現在鄭州荒田很多。不過這些還不是問題的核心，人民出得了出不了還在其次，主要的倒是在八個月中，要供給幾乎三千萬斤的軍公糧從什麼地方來？我們先不講鄭州境內能控制的地區佔幾分之幾，就說是全部能控制吧，鄭州人永遠不會承認鄭州全年的糧產會有三千萬斤的一半。</p>
<p>征糧在河南，早已成為一個</p>
<p>恐怖名詞。今年三月間，豫省參會赴京呼籲團費了五十二天的時間，到五月裏才請准將在此以前的所有欠糧豁免。開封戰役以後，河南傳說中央已准予此後不在河南征購軍糧，可是遭消息似乎沒有能證實，因為最近在河南征購軍糧，依然是急如星火。</p>

<h3 id="c142">秋風 <a href="#c142" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e142" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">142</a></h3>
<p>— 何苦</p>
<p>中午的日頭，雖然還有一點「肆虐」的餘威，究竟節近中秋，早晚之間，漸漸感到有點凉意了。晚間凭南窗以寄傲，半規明月，恰好照到臨窗的臥榻上，秋風微徵吹來，乃有一種沁人心脾的感覺。隨着風過處便從附近的樹葉間傳來一陣沙沙的聲音，葉子開始凋零，俯仰之間，往往令人有故園之思。做過齊王囧治下的大司馬張翰，因秋風而想到菰菜專纑，當時就說過一句非常瀟灑的話：「人生貴得適　，何能覊官數千里以要名爵乎？</p>
<p>思今人不及古人的地方，就是這點落落大方的胸襟。張季鷹在當公敎人員乏味的時候，就可以回家去享淸福。今人便不然，明知其肉不肥，僅是一根骨頭，只能啃住不放，萬一你倒瀟灑起來，想「適志」一下，回到故鄉，不要說缺乏專鱸之美，便是運骨頭也沒有啃了。而在另一方面呢，那邊放棄掉的骨頭，却有一百個人在其欲逐逐，以一啃為滿足。從這種情形看來，未始不是今人的悲哀，听謂生計日蹙也。</p>
<p>說起生計，的確在秋風一起的時候，要感到情形嚴重。為了要維持身體必要的溫暖，單薄的衣裳必需更換了，然而在今日之下想添新裝，眞是談何容易。北京西路的一家西裝店裏，普通貨色的狄裝，買一百廿元。你我或許能够把一個月的收入，悉索敞賦以赴，買下一套，可是往往左支則右絀，府上的伙食，不由得不擱淺起來。有人說兩當軒的「全家都在西風裏，十月寒衣未剪裁」是做作，想敲一記竹槓的。衡之今日情形，除非將就一點，穿一身舊衣算數，想全家剪裁新衣，實在也決非一般人能力範圍所能辦到。但上海的時裝店多如雨後春爭，而且每家都是生意興隆，仕女如雲，假如單把這一部份的畫面放大了看，黃仲則的詩句簡直寒酸得令人不値一顧了。</p>
<p>話得說回來，就大自然的景色而言，則秋風一起，景色正復不凡。此時在自然界的色彩，雖然不及三月春光；恰是剛從絢爛歸於平淡且還帶着一點絢麗的餘韻。我始終不會忘記此時在錢塘江畔的風帆沙鳥，鄰鄰的水波，碧澄的江流，一直流至極望的遠山之處。劍南詩鈔中所謂「江上漁家水蘸　，閑雲片片傍苔磯」，可以鈎劃出此時錢塘江畔的一點輪　來。</p>
<p>因此秋風一起確是適宜於旅行的季節。人生雖然不免於生活的折磨，究竟應該從折磨的覊絆中脫　出來，欣賞一回大自然的景色。道樣至少比追逐名利要好得多，因為後者僅是野心與感官的滿足，前者才是可以獲得心靈的「適志」。陸放翁說：「不碍家貧尙買書」，其實在「不碍家貧」的原則之下，買書與遨游兩者都是値得一試的。</p>
<h3 id="c143">記呂碧城姊妹　（上） <a href="#c143" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e143" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">143</a></h3>
<p>— 陸丹林</p>
<p>昨閱陳君詒先的「記呂美蓀女士」一文，知其因我所寫的「記呂碧城女士」而聯想到呂美蓀的。關於呂女士的父親和她們姊妹的璅事，就我所知，補述於後</p>
<p>呂女士的父親呂鳳岐，字瑞田，旌德人，同治庚午舉人，光緒丁丑進士，散館授編修。壬午官山西學政，著「靜然齊詩集」，這是陳子言（詩）听編「皖雅初集」所叙述的。跟着有呂美蓀的寫述：「先老登賢書後，充景山宮敎習。甲戌考授內閣中書。光緒丁丑，朝元改翰林院庶吉士，旋授職編修，歷充本衙門撰文，國史館協修，玉牒館纂修。壬午簡放山西學政，任滿，乞病歸僑六安，搆長恩精舍，藏書數萬卷。乙未冬卒，兩兄皆前蔣淑人出，先卒，為鉛山蔣心餘太史曾孫女，亦能詩。吾母為來安嚴琴堂孝廉之女，乃武寅齊太守沈湘佩夫人之外孫女。來歸先考為繼室，生四女。先老旣卒，惡族爭繼嗣，佔家產。……看此，則知道呂女士的家世了。</p>
<p>呂氏姊妹是四人，長惠如，次美葉，（初名賢鈖，字仲素，後改眉生，又改美蓀，寄寓靑島時，別署齊州女布衣。）三碧城（字遁天，又字聖因），四賢滿，字坤秀。惠如工詞，兼工繪事，碧城在曉珠詞附刊「惠如長短句」的跋文有說：「先長姊惠如邃於國學，淹貫百家，有巾幗宿儒之概。矢志柏舟，主持姆敎，長江寗國立師範女校有年，人多仰其行誼。歿時家難糾紛，著作湮沒，遺稿之求，列人訟案，蓋與遺產同被攫奪，亦往古才人所未聞也。……惠如的丈夫為嚴象賢，是屬表兄妹的聯婚，美葉「重至京師」詩所說：一我姊奉巾服，外兄而姊夫」，就是指他。惠如的逝世，約在民國十年以後，因民國九年冬間，惠如還有塡詞，碧城是民九赴美，惠如死時，碧城適歸國。</p>
<p>蓀在她的「　洲訪討記」叙述東遊緣起有說：「余弱齡失怙，由豐厚之家，一變而為孤寒之女。年二十後，別母走津門，任北洋女子公學敎習，兼北洋高等女學堂總敎習。踰年，出榆關，應東三省將軍趙公爾　之召，任奉天女子師範學堂敎務長，兼中日合辦女子美術學校敎員，名譽校長。蓋趙公與先君提學公為丁丑會榜同年，念年家子之貧，厚加培植，時光緒未葉也。彼時可求官費，負笈歐西，卒以母老須養，勢難遠遊。年踰三十，復忝敎閩滬女學，最校長江蘇安徽師範女學校。……自念平生行歷八九省，南北極國境。……」這是她的自傳之一章。她的詩文集，已出版的有：「葂麗園詩」正續集，「陽春白雪詞，「瀛洲訪詩記」等。抗戰前，住在靑島，她的兒子絗德，在靑島的上海銀行工作。近年以來，音書隔絕，是否還在靑島，無從得知。</p>
<h3 id="c144">排隊買剩餘物資記 <a href="#c144" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e144" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">144</a></h3>
<p>— 毛裕定</p>
<p>日前見報上載着：物資供應局假永安大樓出售大量剩餘物資，市民購者衆多，尤以罐頭食品一項為之搶購一空。我也想去買便宜貨了。那天早晨八時，我趕到永安，一看已有幾十個人在胡北路門口排着隊等候了</p>
<p>終於我也挨進了大樓的門，剛想鬆一口氣，可是立刻又緊張起來：要尋找自已心目中的便宜東西。我注意着每一隻櫃台裏貨物的價格，除了五金·西藥這兩項東西我不大熟悉之外，其他如罐頭食品·文具等東西，依我看來並未較別處來得便宜；然而却有成堆的人在擁擠着瘋狂地購買。我心中暗想，他們無疑是比我更熟悉市面了。我在塲內兜了兩圈，沒有買一點東西。一想總不能空着二手來，依舊空着二手　去，便買了兩聽桃子，每聽五角。正在付款時，許許多多男女都擁過來買桃子了。起初我不明白這是甚麼意思，後來才明白了，他們是一羣實足道地的　從者，看見我買桃子，就以為桃子一定便宜了。</p>
<p>我沒有留戀多久，匆匆狹了兩聽桃子擠出來。滿耳都是嗡嗡的聲音，出了門才覺得頭腦一淸，像是剛剛走出一個養滿蜜蜂的花園一樣。</p>
<h3 id="c145">生命與財富 <a href="#c145" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e145" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">145</a></h3>
<p>— 陳烟帆</p>
<p>近來常常在無意中想起一個問題，也許是與見到聽到的周圍事情有關的。一個時常見面的年靑朋友忽然傳來惡耗，是得了急症死的。繼在美游泳溺死的唐君之外朋友又少了一個。最近又有一個親戚，祗有二十多歲的人，却是肺病咯血，三天不見又躺在床上嚴重非凡了。除了唐君之外，上面所說急症而亡的朋友和那位親戚，平素我都知道是生活毫無約束的靑年，前者時常暴飲暴食，舞場咖啡室留連忘返，後者也是早婚貧玩的富家哥兒。</p>
<p>對於生命之脆弱無常，很有人因此而生厭世之念。淺一點的則是享樂玩世，遇事懶惰頹唐。深一點的悲觀逃避，甚至成為精神病者。中國人的知識階級或非知識階級，都常常說：「人活在世上，有什麼意思呢？說不定什麼時候死了，乘年輕有錢的時候吃吃玩玩。」前人的詩有「對酒當歌，人生幾何？」「今日有酒今日醉」之句。可見得抱有吃玩享樂觀念的人不止一個。</p>
<p>靑春和財富都是世上可寳貴的東西。可是年靑的人和世上有財富的人都不知道寳貴他們的靑春和財富。我們可以在最近的報上看到近一時期在上海作着投機囤積勾當的市虎被拘的消息。這些已經擁有大量財富的人還要拼命積聚財當，不擇手段，以觸法紀。他們並且多數就是不肯拿出什麼救濟特捐的，世上的富人們都是這樣，財當越多，越是不知道它的用處。他們寗可放着，危害或圈禁他們的子孫及自已。</p>
<p>財富是可寳貴的，因為它有力量，可作着有益於大羣人的事業。靑春也是可寳貴的。也是因為它有力量，可作着有益於大羣人的事業。享樂頹唐自私自利者的世界日益狹小，而用生命去貢獻於有益大羣人的事業上的却會得到永遠的快樂。可惜靑年人常常浪費他們的靑春，當人也都不知道財富的力量，因此使得靑春和財富都沒有了它們的意義。</p>

<p>— 冀雲</p>
<p>時屆中秋，蓄養蟋蟀者各出所蓄，互鬥賭彩，漸入興高彩烈之時。此風南北皆然，且均愈鬥愈盛，豪華之有閒階級，更將鬥塲得彩之虫，重金收購，以增强實力，四出應敵，聞何處鬥塲最盛，博彩最多，則呼朋引類，會師遠征，縱耗巨資，亦不吝也。然欲求必勝，必須精選佳虫，故捕虫及選擇之術，係屬首要，特分述如次：</p>
<p>（一）捕虫：捕虫必在黑夜。（日間國虫呼雌之聲，亦可捕之，但歡甚少。）聞虫鳴聲，覔而捕之，善捕者，一聞虫鳴，卽能測和虫之大小及其良否，初秋之夜，徧地皆是虫嗚，若不能辨聲，但聞聲卽捕，縱勞碌終宵，獲虫無算，仍是一無可取。大抵唧唧長鳴，聲小而不斷者，鮮有佳虫，且虫身甚小，不堪一捕。其鳴僅數聲，輙卽停止，少時又鳴數聲者，則多可取之虫。鳴聲洪大者，其虫身亦多較大，或為頭有白點之虫。聲堅實而消亮者，多佳虫。若似帶有金屬之聲者，多為靑色之虫，晚秋之健將也。聲作「丕丕」之音者，多為闊翅，或油紫油黃油靑色之虫，稱雄於早秋者也。鳴後帶有「令令」之曾者，則此虫之翅，與凡虫稍異，能顫動作此聲，如蟬翼然，其中頗多可取者。夭初黑，或天將明時，各虫齊鳴，為捕者最好機會，此外則有鳴有不鳴，尤以雨後虫鳴最盛。若大雨之後，繼以烈日，則此後數夕，均為最佳之良機，以虫經雨潤日烘，產生最盛故也。至捕虫之法，先須聽淸聲出何洞，然後輕輕燃火，詳予窺視，虫頭多在洞口，望見之，卽將竹或鐵議，從旁插入，橫抄其後，輕輕抽動，驅虫使出。不可力猛，猛則虫必驚跳，追覔殊雖。又不可以火逼近洞口，驚及虫　，使其逃回深洞，無法使出。尤忌以簽迎虫頭插入，非將虫插死，卽迫虫逃入橫洞，雖灌以水，亦不能必其出矣。至虫被驅出洞，如見佳虫，不可驚慌，否則將虫驚走，或將虫捕傷，宜以馬尾或細銅絲所織之罩，輕輕罩之，虫旣入罩，然後貯入器中，携歸而養以瓦權，此虫始為我有矣。</p>
<p>（二）選擇：早秋之虫極多，若收購與捕捉並行，日得數百，亦甚易易，但可取者究屬少數。剔選全憑眼力，初捕之蟲，顏色旣非正常，全身侮多緊縮，非老手不能辨其優劣。辨色以正靑為上，正黃正紫次之，淡靑淡黃淡紫又次之，雄色及油光者最下。因蟲以愈冷而愈少，博彩亦愈多，上述正色諸蟲，天冷最為善鬥，尤以正靑為教，故列上選也。至蟲之形，第一頭與牙須大，次則項須寬，身須長大，肉須細實，腿脚須長大，但若各形俱佳，而色晦暗，則仍不足取，故辨色最離，非老手不能也。</p>

<h3 id="e1">President Chiang Launches National Thrift and Construction Movement as a Citizen, Broadcast Appeal to the Nation's Military and Civilians to Unite and Promote it, Reforming Society and Eliminating Two Major Threats <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 15th] President Chiang delivered a broadcast speech at 9:00 PM on the 15th, calling on the nation's military and civilians to jointly launch a National Thrift and Construction Movement to complement the implementation of the previously announced emergency financial and economic measures, serving as the starting point for social reform. The outline of the National Thrift and Construction Movement was drafted by Huang Shao-gu, Peng Zhao-xian, Gu Zheng-gang, and others. The President attached great importance to this, so he decided to announce it via broadcast. However, due to the President's busy schedule, staff from the Central Broadcasting Station went to Beijige at 4:00 PM on the 15th to record the President's address. During the 9:00 PM broadcast, all military personnel and civilians across the country were able to respectfully listen to the President's earnest and sincere instructions.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 15th] President Chiang, contributing one-tenth of his personal assets, launched the National Thrift and Construction Movement and broadcast the outline of the movement to the compatriots nationwide at 9:00 PM on the 15th on the Central Broadcasting Station. The original text is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Today, China's most pressing need is to relieve the people's suffering and stabilize social order. To achieve this goal, we must first quell the rebellion of the treacherous Communist bandits and accelerate the victory of the bandit suppression campaign. This is the unanimous wish of all compatriots nationwide and the shared responsibility of all compatriots nationwide. Therefore, all compatriots nationwide must recognize the gravity of this responsibility and the arduousness of this mission. We must all grit our teeth, summon our courage, and work together with one heart and one mind, being diligent and thrifty, to overcome this final difficult hurdle of our national revolution and achieve our common goal.</p>
<p>Compatriots, everyone must also know that the great calamity of our nation and the great enemy of national construction lie not only in the troubles caused by the treacherous bandits and the economic decline but also in the speculative manipulations and extravagant excesses of the parasitic class. In particular, the selfishness, waste, luxury, decadence, and corruption of the exploiting elements have affected the morale of the nation and created social injustice. As the saying goes, "Diligence and thrift are the foundation of self-cultivation." A Western proverb also says, "Luxury is the great enemy of national construction." We must first overcome this internal great enemy, renounce luxury, eliminate corruption, advocate frugality, and actively engage in construction before the bandit suppression and pacification work can be thoroughly completed. Therefore, today, I, Zhongzheng, initiate the National Thrift and Construction Movement as a citizen and formulate the outline of the movement, hoping to use the common flow of society to wash away the dregs of society and lay the foundation for victory in suppressing the rebellion and success in national construction. I earnestly hope that all compatriots nationwide will rise up together to promote this movement, rigorously implement this outline, and fulfill the mission of suppressing the rebellion and building the nation for everyone.</p>
<p>Outline of the National Thrift and Construction Movement</p>
<p>(1) Key Points of the Promoting Thrift and Building the Nation Movement After the victory of China's War of Resistance against Japan, we encountered two major threats: one is the full-scale rebellion of the violent group of treacherous Communist bandits, and the other is the economic devastation and social injustice caused by the rebellion of the treacherous bandits. Whether these two major threats can be eliminated will determine the success or failure of the construction of our New China and even the fate of the survival of the Chinese nation.</p>
<p>Today, all patriotic military personnel and civilians across the country are engaged in a life-and-death struggle with the public enemy of the nation and the country—the traitorous Communist bandits. The majority of the people, who are struggling on the brink of starvation, are contributing money and effort, shedding blood and sweat, to support the war to suppress the rebellion and save the country. However, some parasitic classes who do not work or produce, as well as speculators who hoard and manipulate and use all illegal means to seize wealth, live extravagant and dissolute lives. They not only destroy the country's productive forces but also create a decadent atmosphere of social corruption, which affects the morale of the nation and the morale of suppressing the rebellion.</p>
<p>In order to correct this unreasonable phenomenon, in order to thoroughly implement total warfare, concentrate the nation's manpower, financial resources, and material resources, and exert a high degree of efficiency to ensure the victory of suppressing the rebellion and the success of national construction, we cannot but awaken the self-awareness and self-control of the social parasitic class and speculators, and make a great effort in the two words "diligence and thrift," eradicate the bad habits of laziness and dissipation, work hard with the laboring masses, increase production, save on consumption, repay the country, and fulfill the natural duty of citizens. This is the key point of our launching of the Thrift and National Building Movement. This movement is not only the starting point for changing the atmosphere and reforming society but also a part of the general mobilization work for suppressing the rebellion and building the nation. Under the banner of this movement, we hope that everyone will achieve the following two points: "Reduce the consumption of public and private life to the lowest limit," and "Maximize the work, production, and combat power."</p>
<h3 id="e2">Soldier-like Life at the Front, Civilian-like Life in the Rear to Guarantee the Success of the Cause of Suppressing Rebellion and Building the Nation <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>Mission of the Movement</p>
<p>(2) Mission of the Thrift and National Building Movement</p>
<p>The Thrift and National Building Movement is the practice of the national revolution at the current stage. Its historical mission is to call on all patriots to jointly promote the spirit of self-reliance, self-help, self-strengthening, and self-control, practice a life of diligence and hard work, and, by means of persuasion, influence, and service, extend this to others, so that society forms a spontaneous and self-controlled binding force to correct the tendency of the polarization of rich and poor lifestyles, in order to gradually achieve the goal of soldier-like life at the front and civilian-like life in the rear.</p>
<p>Economically, the Thrift and National Building Movement is intended to enable the entire society to eliminate the excessive inequality of enjoyment due to the restraint of life and the economy of consumption. Due to the popularization of labor and the improvement of efficiency, gradual increases in production can be achieved, that is, on the one hand, to coordinate our people's way of life with the economic capabilities of the people, prevent the extravagant material life of merchants, wealthy merchants, gentry, and prominent officials, and on the other hand, to encourage labor, strengthen production, develop national economic construction, and accumulate the potential for national defense construction, especially at present, due to the prohibition of waste, the effects of stabilizing prices, consolidating currency values, and balancing international payments can be achieved.</p>
<p>Politically, the Thrift and National Building Movement is intended to use the practice of diligent production and hardworking living as an effective means to eradicate corruption and improve efficiency, especially to thoroughly implement total warfare, and to make the nation's manpower, financial resources, and material resources as much as possible meet the needs of the military, in order to strengthen the combat effectiveness of the national army and quell the internal rebellion as soon as possible. At the same time, under the goal of soldier-like life at the front and civilian-like life in the rear, the military and the people, the generals and the soldiers, the officials and the people, and the poor and the rich are brought together by the proximity of living standards, which promotes psychological unity and consistency in action, so that the whole country is united and becomes a strong fighting body to ensure the success of the cause of suppressing the rebellion and building the nation.</p>
<p>Ten Pledges</p>
<p>(3) Pledges of the Thrift and National Building Movement</p>
<p>In order to practice and promote the Thrift and National Building Movement, we have specially formulated ten pledges, which are set as common goals. All those who participate in this movement must abide by and strive to practice these pledges: (1) Work actively and build actively. (2) Observe time and observe order. (3) Eliminate corruption and reduce corruption. (4) Renounce luxury and renounce waste. (5) Equality of life and equality before the law. (6) Suppressing bandits first and building the nation first. (7) Everything for the front line and everything for production. (8) Soldier-like life at the front and civilian-like life in the rear. (9) Respect officers and soldiers and serve the army. (10) Love farmers and workers and serve society.</p>
<p>Practical Objectives</p>
<p>(4) Practice of the Thrift and National Building Movement</p>
<p>The Thrift and National Building Movement has the historical mission of transforming society, economy, and politics. The way to promote it is to practice it personally, and everyone should express a style of diligence and thrift in their daily lives. All those who participate in this movement must abide by the pledges and first of all act practically and practice personally, starting with the following simple items:</p>
<p>Regarding promoting diligence:</p>
<p>1. Self-reliance and self-help: Every physically and mentally sound citizen must participate in labor and support themselves. All work that is within one's ability to manage one's own life should not rely on others, so as to make the best use of one's talents and not waste the efforts of others, that is, to fully exert the total labor force of the nation.</p>
<p>2. Observe time, grasp time, seize time, be specialized and rapid in work, and indeed improve efficiency, and use spare time to engage in work that is beneficial to physical and mental health and spiritual service, so that those who work with their minds can exercise their bodies, and those who work with their hands can improve their intelligence.</p>

Assist refugees in finding employment and develop production work: (1) Refugees, vagrants, and unemployed workers gather in the rear, and the huge labor force has nowhere to be used, while the consumption of materials has become a heavy burden on the country during the period of suppressing the rebellion. It is necessary to mobilize social forces to assist them, so that the unemployed can find employment, the unemployed can resume work, and those engaged in improper occupations can transfer to occupational sectors that are beneficial to national defense and people's livelihood, so that the social consumption power can be transformed into production power. (2) Persuade the people to invest in productive undertakings that are beneficial to the national economy and people's livelihood, such as purchasing stocks of state-owned and public-owned enterprises or operating industry and mining, so as to utilize idle funds, mobilize social forces, open factories or farms, promote road construction, afforestation, reclamation, canal repair, improvement of environmental sanitation, and various construction works, implement work-for-relief, combine relief with production, so as to absorb the surplus social labor force and gradually start national construction work.</p>
<p>6.

(3) Advocate local self-defense work, tighten the people's organizations, check the household registration, rectify the Baojia system, universally launch the movement to eliminate traitors, report bandit conspiracies, eliminate lurking bandits, and strengthen counter-espionage and secrecy work, so as to consolidate the rear.

(5) Launch the youth joining the army movement, universally organize groups to supervise conscription, report the malpractices of the Baojia and the behavior of impersonating, practically improve the lives of recruits, improve their treatment, respect the personality of new soldiers, and protect the lives of military families, so as to improve morale and strengthen combat power. (6) Advocate respecting officers and soldiers and serving the army movement, universally launch activities such as sending off, assisting in the war, rescue, consolation, reward, celebration of victory, and celebration, so as to enhance the feelings between the military and the people and strengthen the spirit of suppressing the rebellion.</p>
<p>Universal Frugality</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 15th] Former Executive Yuan President Zhang Qun returned to the country after visiting Japan. He arrived in Beijing from Shanghai at 7:10 on the 15th. The reporter interviewed Mr. Zhang at the station and asked him to briefly talk about his impressions of visiting Japan. Mr. Zhang first declared that there was no news. He brought back a lot of information, which will be released after sorting out, but most of the opinions have been broadcast in Japan on the eve of his departure. The reporter asked if there was a plan to travel to Southeast Asian countries. Mr. Zhang said: We should understand the newly emerging countries in Southeast Asia after the war. Individuals are willing to make this visit, but the plan for this trip has not yet been decided. Mr. Zhang did not say a word about the Japanese question, and then exchanged greetings with the welcomers and boarded the car to return to his residence. After a short rest, Foreign Minister Wang Shijie visited and talked for two hours. He went to Beijige at noon to visit the President and had lunch with Wang Shijie and others. Mr. Zhang briefly presented the main points of his visit to Japan. During the meeting, there was also discussion on the issue of Japan. After listening to the report, the President also gave some instructions.</p>
<h3 id="e4">Revolutionary Social Movement Must Have a Strong Organization, Starting with Shanghai and Beijing as a Demonstration <a href="#e4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>(5) Organization of the Thrift and National Building Movement</p>
<p>1. The Thrift and National Building Movement is a revolutionary social movement. It must have a plan and a strong organization to be responsible for promoting it, and this organization must be a spontaneous and automatic people's organization.</p>
<p>2. In order to make the organization sound and powerful, it is necessary to adopt a gradual expansion method. The phased organizational work should start from Beijing, Shanghai, and major cities as a demonstration. When there is a success, it will gradually be extended to other areas.</p>
<p>3. Before establishing an organization in each region, the principle of "taking action as a call" should be followed, and universal and effective publicity work should be carried out. It must also go through a full and planned preparatory stage. The preparation work should be carried out from the central to the local level. The personnel responsible for the preparation must have the "conditions of setting an example and the spirit of serving selflessly."</p>
<p>4. The Thrift and National Building Movement should have a sound basic organization as the basic force for achieving the various tasks of this movement. The number of people in each basic organization should not exceed 15, so as to ensure reliable contact and flexible action.</p>
<p>5. Any social person who pledges to act in accordance with the pledges of the Thrift and National Building Movement and meets the prescribed standards can participate in the organization of the Thrift and National Building Movement, but must first participate in its basic organization, and it must be voluntary, and must have the determination to practice personally and the guarantee of their own thrifty behavior. In the process of organizational development, the responsible personnel should strictly abide by the principle of "rather be short than indiscriminate." If members who violate the long pledges are found in the organization, they must be punished after verification, and the disguised corrupt members and sensational speculators inside should be eliminated to ensure the purity of the organization.</p>
<p>6. Every member of the organization must undergo self-examination, mutual supervision, and common encouragement. Not only must they practice personally, but they must also play a leading role and expand their influence. In particular, they must encourage relatives and friends who meet the prescribed standards to actively participate in the organization, so that this movement can develop in a radiative manner.</p>
<p>7. In addition to conducting activities in the region, the basic organization should also be universally carried out in factories, shops, schools, troops, agencies, societies, and professional groups. When there are several basic organizations in the same region or department, a liaison organization should be established to strengthen the grassroots work of this movement.</p>
<p>8. When the organizational work in the same area reaches a considerable level, a central organization should be established in that area to lead the promotion of the Thrift and National Building Movement in that area.</p>
<p>9. The central hub of the Thrift and National Building Movement organization should be located in the capital city, and it should be responsible for leading all levels of organizations across the country to promote this movement.</p>
<p>Publicity and Promotion</p>
<p>(6) Promotion of the Thrift and National Building Movement</p>
<p>1. Before the Thrift and National Building Movement is launched, universal and in-depth publicity should be carried out to make the majority of the people understand that this is a revolutionary social movement that eliminates injustice, understand the close relationship between this movement and the people's own interests, and ignite the enthusiasm to welcome this movement.</p>
<p>2. Enthusiastically welcome the working masses to join the organization to enrich the Thrift and National Building Movement, give the working masses honor and spiritual encouragement, make them play a demonstration role, and make them form an organized moral force by participating in this movement, especially to let them have the right to criticize and report any lazy and extravagant elements, and exert the great role of moral sanctions.</p>
<p>3. The Thrift and National Building Movement and the government's measures to mobilize to suppress the rebellion and build the country, the plan to reform the monetary system and manage the economy and finance, and the laws to eliminate corruption and clarify governance must be closely linked and coordinated, so that automatic awareness and reflection and passive persuasion and compulsion complement each other.</p>
<p>4. In order to cooperate with the actions of the working masses in reporting and criticizing the lazy and extravagant elements in society, the public opinion circles across the country should be mobilized to continuously impose sanctions on those who violate the pledges of the Thrift and National Building Movement, and announce the names and extravagant and wasteful facts of these elements in newspapers or radio stations, creating a new atmosphere, so that the general public believes that excessive luxury and enjoyment is a disgraceful behavior. At the same time, we should do our best to praise those clean and diligent civil and military officials and the frugal gentry and cultural, educational, and business circles, give them spiritual encouragement and comfort, so as to play a role in changing the atmosphere in society.</p>
<p>5. We must make a correct estimate of the working object, the objective environment, and the possible limitations. For different occupations, different classes, and different living conditions, we must determine the steps, plans, and contents of each work. That is, we must formulate policies based on people, things, time, and place. All plans must be specific and feasible, and even slogans must be higher than reality. It is absolutely not allowed to become official documents and exam-oriented dogma. Do not start things lightly that cannot be done, but once the work to be promoted has been decided, you must concentrate all your efforts, eliminate all difficulties, and carry it through to the end.</p>
<p>6. Review and study at all times, obtain valuable experience from work, correct the mistakes that have been made, and truly grasp the correctness of the Thrift and National Building Movement. We must use perseverance, perseverance, and enthusiasm to make this great movement deep, universal, and lasting. (End)</p>

<h3 id="e12">Sending the Special Envoy Delegation from Korea to the Philippines and the United States <a href="#e12" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c12" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">12</a></h3>
<p>The Korean President Dr. Syngman Rhee's special envoy delegation to the Philippines and the United States, headed by Special Envoy Zhao Bingyu, set off on the 9th of this month, arrived in Shanghai via Japan on the 11th, and arrived in Nanjing the next morning, paying respects to President Chiang. They returned to Shanghai on the 14th and were warmly welcomed by all sectors of the city yesterday. They will fly to the Philippines this afternoon. We listened to Special Envoy Zhao's speech at the welcome tea party yesterday and were deeply moved. Now we casually write a few words as a farewell message.</p>
<p>As Special Envoy Zhao said, "The expansion of international communism today has made the establishment of the Republic of Korea extremely difficult." Is it just Korea that is like this? In the past two or three years, the Chinese people have defeated the invading Japanese pirates, but they still cannot enjoy the fruits of victory. The flames of war are everywhere, and disasters are rampant. Isn't this also due to the expansion of international communism? The reason why international communism conflicts with national independence is less due to communism itself and more due to its complete command by the Communist International. Under the command of the Communist International, China is an ideal arena for its expanding forces, and Korea is a forward position for its contest with democratic countries in the Far East. Therefore, on the day the Republic of Korea was established, North Korea formed its own separatist government under the aegis of the Soviet Union. This clearly hinders the unification of Korea and carries the danger of Korea becoming a powder keg in the Far East in the future. The purpose of this special envoy delegation's visit abroad is to thank the three countries, but its real task is to "unite peace-loving people all over the world to complete the independence and unification of Korea." This is what Special Envoy Zhao has clearly stated, and we deeply hope for the success of this trip. This is the first point.</p>
<p>China and Korea have always been brothers. For thousands of years, their feelings have been deep. Korea has coexisted with China for two or three thousand years and still exists, but it was annexed by Japan after less than twenty or thirty years of coexistence. The Korean people suffered the pain of national subjugation for nearly forty years. After the war, they were able to form a government and declare independence early because the Allied countries implemented the Cairo Declaration. While our people deeply congratulate Korea, they must be able to appreciate how the warlord imperialism of Japan in the past disturbed the peace of the East. As a plan to punish the past and be careful for the future, the people of China and Korea must permanently and sincerely join hands and unite strongly to prevent the resurgence of Japanese aggression. The so-called Japanese aggressive forces are not just military forces. Its aggressive economic groups and the ideological roots of aggression should all be thoroughly eradicated. It is said that Japan is lying in wait, plotting to come back, and the American authorities in charge of the Allied Control may not be able to see into the lungs of the Japanese. Once they are overly indulgent, there is a risk of repeated harm. China and Korea should jointly take responsibility, using sincere calls to draw the attention of some American authorities and correct their mistaken ideas that have been deceived by Japanese warlords, bureaucrats, and even women. Since the power of the Allied Headquarters is in the hands of the United States, the special envoy delegation should do its best to formally inform the American government and the public not to overindulge the remnants of Japanese warlords and financial groups, leaving the seeds of disaster in East Asia. This is the second point.</p>
<p>Korean President Dr. Syngman Rhee has struggled tirelessly throughout his life for the independence of his motherland. Last April, he returned home from the United States, passing through Shanghai. The impression he left on the people of Shanghai was that he was not only a revolutionary politician but also a scholar with Han learning cultivation. Although Dr. Rhee has lived in the United States for a long time, he is proficient in ancient Chinese prose. Therefore, he is trustworthy, righteous, and not bound by utilitarianism or materialism. He uses a Chinese brush to write beautiful characters and recites good poems, and he is like a brother to the Chinese people. This time, the special envoy delegation is headed by Dr. Zhao Bingyu, who is a close friend of President Rhee. He also knows a lot of poetry by heart and writes beautiful characters. Their deep friendship with China is like one person. We are deeply saddened to bid farewell to the special envoy delegation today. We hope that after completing their mission in the Philippines and the United States, they will return with honor, pass through our country again, and we will do our best as hosts, invite them to stay in the scenic spots of China, sing and compose poetry, and be nurtured in the atmosphere of the long-standing Chinese culture for thousands of years, further enhancing their confidence in loving peace, and working together to maintain world peace, then this trip will be worthwhile. This is the third point.</p>
<p>Sailing thousands of miles, driving and singing quickly, we respectfully wish the Korean special envoy delegation a safe journey and a successful mission!</p>
<h3 id="e13">The President Hosts a Farewell Banquet for Foreign Minister Wang: Our Attitude towards Various Issues at the United Nations General Assembly is Largely Determined; "Acting According to Circumstances" outside the Meeting <a href="#e13" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c13" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">13</a></h3>
<p>[Our newspaper, Nanjing, 15th dispatch] Foreign Minister Wang is scheduled to come to Shanghai on the 16th and fly west to Europe on the 17th. President Chiang specially hosted a farewell banquet for him at his official residence on the afternoon of the 15th, and also hosted a reception for Zhang Yuejun, who had just returned from Japan. During the banquet, Mr. Zhang reported his impressions of his visit to Japan and provided his personal views on the early opening of the Japanese peace conference. The President attached great importance to this. According to authoritative sources, Foreign Minister Wang decided to take advantage of the opening of the UN General Assembly to "act according to circumstances" outside the meeting and hold consultations with foreign diplomats, including making exploratory efforts to convene a Japanese peace conference and discussing other pending issues between our country and other countries. According to reporters, our country's attitude towards various issues in this UN General Assembly has been largely determined. Only one or two important issues need to be finalized after the Foreign Minister arrives in Paris and listens to the reports of our country's officials in the United Nations delegation. Our country has high hopes for this UN General Assembly and will actively work with all countries to seek possible solutions that can be accepted by all, so that the two issues that were most controversial in the last session, namely, restricting the abuse of veto power and determining the control measures for electricity and atomic energy, can be resolved to some extent. In addition, on the Korean issue, we will fully support the report of the United Nations delegation to Korea and advocate assisting the democratically elected government of Korea to achieve true independence and seek unification. Regarding the Convention on Freedom of Information, our country believes that there should be no limits to freedom of the press and will suggest assisting the development of backward news industries in member states. Regarding the Small General Assembly, we may agree to its continued existence. As for the formulation of the International Declaration of Human Rights and the establishment of an international police force, our country will take an active stance. Our country's attitude towards the Balkan, Palestinian, and Kashmir regional issues will also remain unchanged.</p>

<p>[Our newspaper, Nanjing, 15th dispatch] The Control Yuan reviewed the report and attached comments by Control Commissioners Tang Honglie and Sun Yulin on the case of leaking secrets of the currency reform and selling Yongsha yarn, as well as the impeachment case they proposed, after it was sent to the Control Yuan on the 14th. The Control Yuan held a subcommittee meeting on the morning of the 15th to review it and reached a resolution to pass it. The case was formally established, and the impeachment case was sent to the Executive Yuan and handed over for punishment, while the impeachment case was sent to the Committee for the Discipline of Public Officials for handling according to law. It is reported that the targets of the impeachment case are Finance Minister Wang Yunwu, Wang Aotang, the Finance Ministry's supervisor at the Shanghai Stock Exchange, and Shen Yunlong, the Ministry of Industry and Commerce's supervisor at the Shanghai Stock Exchange. The target of the impeachment case is Xu Baiqi, Tao Qiming, and Xu Zhuanghuai. The reason for Wang Yunwu's impeachment is leaking secrets, while the officials stationed in Shanghai by the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Industry are being impeached for ineffective supervision. The punishment methods are still to be decided by the Executive Yuan. According to authoritative sources, the impeached officials will not be subject to suspension from their positions. In addition, the impeachment case against Xu Baiqi and others is based on the grounds of using their power to speculate and profit. The punishment methods will be decided by the Committee for the Discipline of Public Officials. In this way, both the judicial and administrative parts of the case will come to an end.</p>
<p>[Our newspaper, Nanjing, 15th dispatch] The report by Control Commissioners Tang Honglie and Sun Yulin on the case of leaking secrets and selling Yongsha yarn is expected to be released on the 17th, and the impeachment cases will also be sent out separately. It is also learned that Tang and others are still investigating the entire circumstances of the case, and if there are new clues, they will conduct further investigations. It is rumored that the so-called hidden scholar is not Xu Baiqi or Tao Qiming, but someone else, but in fact, there are no new clues at present. In addition, regarding the previous rumor that the Commercial Press changed book prices on the eve of the currency reform, Tang and Sun have investigated the situation and learned that the Shanghai Book and Newspaper Association held a meeting on August 16 and decided to increase prices before the 18th. The Commercial Press's price increase was in compliance with this decision and was not related to the secret leakage case, so the previous rumor has been proven to be inaccurate.</p>

<p>[Our newspaper, Guangzhou, 15th dispatch] According to a senior official of the Bank of China in Guangzhou, since the currency reform, the amount of overseas remittances received by the bank has suddenly increased due to financial stability and the upcoming Mid-Autumn Festival, and it is expected to increase by more than double compared to last month. In the past two days, various banks and bureaus have been enthusiastically redeeming gold, silver, and foreign currency, and the black market price of Hong Kong dollars is even lower than the official price. In the past, due to the trade relationship between Guangdong and Hong Kong, unscrupulous merchants still maintained the so-called Hong Kong dollar black market after the issuance of the new currency, lowering the value of the gold yuan. However, in the past two days, it has risen to 72, that is, 72 gold yuan can be exchanged for 100 Hong Kong dollars. This phenomenon has not occurred since the victory, which shows that the prospects for the new currency will be more optimistic.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Xiamen, 15th dispatch] Since the currency reform, a large amount of overseas remittances has poured in. Last week, the overseas remittances received by various banks and bureaus in Xiamen reached 2,214,467 gold yuan, equivalent to US$552,600. Combined with the previous two weeks, the total is equivalent to US$677,660, with most of it remitted from the Philippines, followed by Yangon and Hong Kong.</p>

Afterwards, reporters and photographers from various newspapers raised questions. The president of the court replied in a clever tone: "This case is an investigation court today. Because the defendant's identity is special, it is not convenient to make it public. If you reporters file a lawsuit, I will definitely do the same."</p>

<p>Control Work is Extremely Lax</p>
<p>[Report from our Changsha office, 15th] The prices of daily necessities continue to rise endlessly, with prices changing every three days. The Municipal Economic Management Committee only holds meetings, taking no action. Wang Boyong, the Director-General of the committee, even stated publicly that the price limits set on August 19th were too far from market prices and advocated for a wider range. After the police team investigated and banned the black market, merchants felt dissatisfied. Mayor Jiang also instructed that future task executions should be handled with consideration for objective circumstances. Today is the eve of the Mid-Autumn Festival, and vegetable prices are particularly bad, rising by more than double. However, piece goods and foreign yarn prices have fallen, some even below the set price limit, due to the weakness of the Shanghai market and the influx of goods.</p>

<h3 id="e31">Taiwan Power Company Receives U.S. Aid; Electrification of Taiwan's Prospect is Promising; Decides to Repair Transmission Line Voltage Regulators <a href="#e31" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c31" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">31</a></h3>
<p>[Report from our Taipei office, 15th] The five new power projects announced by Stuart Layman in Washington include industrial accessories worth 1.15 million U.S. dollars for the Taiwan Power Company, far exceeding the company's original application. All sectors of Taiwan province are excited and feel that the electrification of Taiwan will create a beautiful future. According to the Taiwan Power Company authorities: for the past three years, restoration work has been carried out under the principle of self-reliance without obtaining a single foreign exchange. Therefore, the biggest difficulty is that although there is sufficient power generation, the lack of transmission equipment prevents the power from being fully transmitted and adequately distributed. During the Japanese occupation, the main transmission line voltage regulators were originally 154,000 volts, but now they are only 140,000 volts, requiring an additional 14,000 volts. Because there are no new devices to replace them, they are often damaged by weather, climate, and typhoons. Therefore, after receiving accessory assistance, it was decided to first restore the main transmission line voltage to the Japanese occupation records and reorganize and improve it so that it would not be affected by typhoons. It is estimated that this project will fit the U.S. aid amount. Regarding expansion issues, the company has separately applied for 3 million U.S. dollars under the construction item, which may be obtained. Then the previously planned Tianleng and Wulai power generation projects can be completed. Currently, the Wulai Power Plant has independently installed a generator that can generate 12,000 kilowatts. If construction aid is obtained, it is planned to install a large-scale generator at Tianleng, generating 26,000 kilowatts, and add another one at Wulai, generating 12,000 kilowatts. The two locations will generate a total of 50,000 kilowatts, which can make up for the current shortage of 50,000 kilowatts for industrial electricity. Currently, the scale of Taiwan Power Company is second only to Shanghai, ranking second in the country, and the amount of industrial electricity consumption is even higher, making Taiwan an industrial society. The ideal doesn't seem too far away.</p>

<h3 id="e37">The Italian Colonial Issue; Transferred to the UN General Assembly for Handling; The Four Powers Met for Three Days Without Agreement; The Soviet Union Proposed a New Proposal That Was Not Adopted <a href="#e37" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c37" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">37</a></h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 15th] The representatives of the four countries passed a letter to UN Secretary-General Lie today at their last meeting. The purpose of the letter is to notify Lie that the Four Powers Conference has decided to transfer the issue of former Italian colonies to the UN General Assembly for handling. The document was written in French and signed by the heads of the Four Power delegations. At the same time, the Four Powers Conference also decided to send the investigation committee's report and the recommendations of the London Foreign Ministers' Conference to the United Nations.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Paris, 15th] The issue of the disposition of Italy's pre-war African colonies, namely Libya, Somaliland, and Eritrea, was transferred to the United Nations for handling on the 15th. Because the representatives of the Four Powers had not reached a consensus by noon on the 15th (Paris time), the issue automatically became a UN General Assembly issue. During the Four Power discussions, Soviet representative Vyshinsky suddenly proposed a new proposal, advocating that the territories be placed under UN trusteeship. Previously, the Soviet Union strongly advocated returning the colonies to Italy. In 1946, U.S. Secretary of State Byrnes advocated UN trusteeship of the territories. This time, the Soviet Union completely copied and proposed it. (According to Byrnes' proposal, an advisory committee of the United Nations would be set up, including representatives of the Four Powers and representatives of local residents, so the Soviet Union would have a say in Italian-owned Africa.) The change in Soviet policy shocked the representatives of Western countries. Britain said it opposed the plan from beginning to end, while the United States made no comment. The Soviet proposal died in procedural debates, and as a result, the time limit arrived, and the Four Powers still disagreed. The Italian peace treaty stipulated that the Four Foreign Ministers' Conference would have one year to decide on the issue before it was transferred to the United Nations, but the Four Foreign Ministers' Conference had not reached an agreement after several talks.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Paris, 14th] Today's meeting was completely wasted in fruitless debate. Soviet representative Vyshinsky condemned the United States, Britain, and France for trying to divide up Mussolini's former empire and accused the United States of building an air force base at Manraha in Tripoli, a strategic location, which was a violation of the treaty with Italy.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 14th] A U.S. State Department spokesperson today reiterated the U.S. government's position on the issue of the former Italian colonies as follows: Somaliland should be placed under UN trusteeship and governed by Italy. Cyrenaica should be placed under UN trusteeship and governed by the United Kingdom. The issue of who Tripoli should belong to should be delayed for one year for discussion. The southern part of Eritrea should be immediately ceded to Abyssinia, and who the northern part should belong to should be decided within one year.</p>

<p>[Our report] London, 15th, broadcast: Responsible sources claim that the Berlin issue talks, after being held in Moscow this weekend, will be moved to Paris for continuation. The British, American, and French envoys met yesterday with Molotov, not Stalin. This meeting is extremely important. If there is success, it will be handed over to the Four Foreign Ministers for discussion in Paris. Otherwise, the United Kingdom, the United States, and France will submit the issue to the United Nations for handling.</p>
<p>[Our report] Moscow, 15th, broadcast: Rumors that yesterday's talks between the British, American, and French ambassadors and the Soviet authorities were the last are absolutely untrue. The Four Powers' talks on the Berlin situation will continue, and these talks will be held again this weekend.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Moscow, 14th] The three Western special envoys held their ninth meeting with Molotov on the 14th to discuss the Berlin crisis. The meeting lasted only ninety minutes, the shortest of all the meetings. According to authoritative sources in Washington and London before the meeting, the three Western envoys will ask the Soviet Union for a "yes" or "no" answer on lifting the Berlin blockade and will refuse to discuss other issues until the Berlin blockade is lifted. Smith said after the meeting, "Molotov, Siminov; no comment." Smith's words referred to Molotov and Siminov's participation in the meeting. The three envoys then went to the British Embassy to review the reports submitted to their respective governments.</p>

<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 15th] Congressional foreign policy observers believe that if Dewey is elected president in November, control of West Germany will quickly be transferred from the Department of the Army to the Department of State. Dulles, Dewey's foreign policy advisor, and Vandenberg, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, have both formally expressed their support for this move. If the Republican Party comes to power, one of these two may become Secretary of State. During the recent tension in Berlin, the idea of ​​transferring jurisdiction has only increased, not decreased. Furthermore, it is learned that some Republicans believe that "the military leaders in Berlin are advocating for a tough stance, while the American diplomats are negotiating with the Soviets in a coordinated manner," which is unwise. The transfer of control does not necessarily lead to the departure of Lieutenant General Clay, the military governor of Germany. Dulles and Vandenberg have praised Clay's performance, but once the system is changed, Clay's authority will be greatly reduced.</p>

<p>[Associated Press, Berlin, 14th] According to German sources: the Soviets will start a large-scale search along the borders of the Berlin occupation zones on the night of the 14th. The German police in the British occupation zone of Berlin have strengthened their guard. There is no definite indication as to the reason for the alleged large-scale search operation. As in the past, it is intended to target "black market traders." Some people hinted that the purpose may be to capture Germans who are known to have anti-Soviet or anti-communist tendencies. Before this news occurred, U.S. Commander Clay declared that the U.S. military, regardless of the Soviet Union's "expel Germany" stance, will continue to stay until the last spark of Nazism is extinguished.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Berlin, 14th] The Soviet military court sentenced five German youths who participated in the anti-Soviet demonstration at the Victory Gate on September 9 to twenty-five years of hard labor. This sentence has aroused strong resentment among the citizens of Berlin.</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, New Delhi, 14th] Indian troops are making a lightning advance on the capital of Hyderabad from the east and have already occupied Rayasu, located between Mumbai and Hyderabad, today. The city is approximately 100 miles from the capital of Hyderabad. According to today's Indian public statement: The Indian army's rapid advance on the road from Gulab to Hyderabad has caused a large number of Hyderabad troops and Muslim volunteer Razakars to surrender. Two columns of Indian troops have occupied Daratab and Charna in the Aurangabad region. The column advancing north from Solapur has occupied Osmairabad. Indian troops north of Yarmaira have entered the Falbani and Anjira districts north of Hyderabad. In other areas, Indian troops are currently concentrating their forces and conducting offensive patrols.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Pune, 15th] Indian troops drove straight in from five starting points on the 15th, galloping across the Hyderabad plains, with their spearhead pointing directly at the Hyderabad city, the capital of Hyderabad State. It is rumored that the vanguard is only eighty miles away from the city. The Indian Army Public Gazette also stated: The only fierce battle was at Hosph, the sixth attack point, where the Razakars extremists of the Hyderabad vassal prince counterattacked several times on the night of the 14th. Hosph is a railway intersection located in the Indian-controlled area of ​​Hyderabad, located at the extreme south of Hyderabad. The 1st Armored Division is the main force leading the way, and it has encountered almost no resistance. When the army in Khulab arrives at Sikondurabad, the real battle will occur, because the prince's elite troops are concentrated there, vowing to fight to the last person.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, New Delhi, 15th] India completely entered a state of war on the 15th. After the National Security Order was issued, the government has the right to summon and mobilize national resources to supply the attack on Hyderabad. The new order reinstates the Indian National Defense Regulations that were canceled after the war. It is believed that this severe measure is aimed at dealing with any emergency, including the Indian army's attack on Hyderabad. The Indian government claims that Hyderabad has been completely cut off from all telecommunications and communications with the outside world since the 13th.</p>

<p>[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 14th] U.S. officials believe that although the Indian army's invasion of Hyderabad is inappropriate, it is also very unreasonable for a Muslim country to exist in the center of Indian territory geographically. Officials also believe that Hyderabad cannot resist the Indian army for long, and the Pakistani army may not be able to support it. When the United Nations intervenes, Hyderabad may have already been occupied by the Indian army. However, the conflict between India and Pakistan will inevitably become more serious.</p>

<p>[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 14th] American diplomatic circles expressed the opinion today that President Truman is currently studying suggestions to be submitted to the UN General Assembly with Secretary of State Marshall and Republican leaders. It is heard that these suggestions involve organizing collective security within the framework of Article 51 of the United Nations Charter, which stipulates regional defense agreements. Well-informed sources claim that President Truman may propose to all member states of the United Nations, including the Soviet Union, to negotiate a collective defense treaty, which is equivalent to an "expanded Atlantic Treaty." American observers emphasized that Marshall and Vandenberg advocated establishing such a treaty at the Brazilian capital conference, so as to unite the democratic countries of the world and enhance their strength to resist the spread of communism to the world. Marshall had also submitted the same suggestion at the UN General Assembly in 1947, but it was abandoned at the last minute.</p>

Wu said: Although there are more than 300 people arrested under the emergency regulations, the number of overseas Chinese arrested is still a smaller number.</p>

<h3 id="e53">Responding to International Tensions: Britain Announces Military Buildup, Delays Demobilization, and Recruits Naval and Air Reserves <a href="#e53" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c53" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">53</a></h3>
<p>[United Press, London, 14th] British Deputy Prime Minister Morrison declared in the House of Commons on the 14th that, in view of the serious international situation, Britain has taken four drastic measures to maintain its defense capabilities: (1) delaying demobilization by three months; (2) stepping up work in aircraft factories to double production and refit older aircraft; (3) launching a recruitment campaign to strengthen naval and air force reserves; (4) replenishing munitions and increasing manpower to ensure adequate supplies for the armed forces.</p>
<p>Morrison explained that the reason for delaying demobilization by three months was that the loss of trained soldiers could not be replenished. This situation would be reviewed from time to time based on the latest developments. As a result of these four measures, the strength of the British armed forces would increase by 80,000 more than the original demobilization plan. These additional soldiers are all well-trained, which is what is most needed at present. However, the government deeply regrets taking these measures. As Morrison was speaking, military service orders were being received in Britain and overseas, extending the term of service from one year to fifteen months. Morrison continued that, unfortunately, the current world situation makes some changes to plans unavoidable. The government has no choice but to take certain precautionary measures. According to official statistics, the total number of personnel in the three British armed services at the end of July was 816,000, with approximately 50,000 personnel being discharged each month. Morrison's speech was delivered after the Conservative Party criticized the government for neglecting the international situation.</p>

<p>[United States Information Service, Washington, 14th] The United States believes that Romania's recent law nationalizing industry, banking, insurance, mining, transportation, and other enterprises violates the peace treaty because it discriminates against American interests while favoring the Soviet Union. A protest has been lodged with the Romanian government, stating that the compensation provisions for nationalized property in the law cannot be considered appropriate.

<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 15th] The U.S. Department of Commerce stated that the total value of U.S. goods exported to China in June (including Economic Cooperation Administration aid to China) was $22.8 million, while the total value of goods imported from China to the U.S. was $10.2 million. In July, imports also increased to $11.3 million.

<h3 id="e58">Appendix (II) for the Seventh and Eighth Quarters: Approved Import Quotas of $42,141,000 Approved and Announced Yesterday by the Executive Yuan <a href="#e58" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c58" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">58</a></h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 15th] Since the promulgation of the Emergency Financial Measures Order, in accordance with Article 9 of the Measures for Consolidating Finances and Strengthening Economic Controls, import quotas from the seventh quarter onward should be reduced by at least one-quarter compared to the average level of the fifth and sixth quarters. It is learned that the Import Control Committee has already drafted the import quotas for Appendix (II) commodities for the seventh and eighth quarters, totaling $42,141,000, a decrease of more than one-quarter compared to the fifth and sixth quarters, amounting to $31,331,000. This proposal was discussed at the fourth meeting of the Executive Yuan's Economic Management Committee on the 14th. Among them, passenger cars, jeeps, motor trucks, and long-distance buses, which were originally only subject to quotas without foreign exchange allocation, will be re-evaluated after the situation is clarified. The remaining items were approved as proposed. The Executive Yuan meeting on the morning of the 15th reported the matter, and it was announced for implementation. According to the quotas set this time, items with U.S. aid supply have either not been included in the quotas or only listed with small quotas for supplementation, reducing them by $24,835,000 compared to the fifth and sixth quarters. The remaining items with reduced quotas include tobacco leaves and stems, paper and wood pulp, timber, and wax, totaling a reduction of $690,000. The quota for pharmaceuticals was increased by $400,000 to meet domestic medical needs. Therefore, although more than $30 million has been reduced for the seventh and eighth quarters, the influx of U.S. aid materials means that there should be no actual difficulties. Furthermore, according to the Central Bank's Measures for Payment of Foreign Currency Deposits, all foreign currency deposits in the country can be used to apply for the import of industrial raw materials listed in Appendix (II), so they can complement the quotas set by the Import Control Committee. It is expected that the raw materials needed for industry will be adequately supplied in the future. The approved import quotas for Appendix (II) commodities for the seventh and eighth quarters are listed as follows:</p>
<p>(Unit: U.S. Dollars) (1) Gasoline, aviation gasoline $800,000; (2) Diesel $2,300,000; (3) Kerosene $600,000; (4) Tobacco leaves and stems $2,500,000; (5) Ramie $600,000; (6) Ramie bags $1,400,000; (7) Chemicals $7,000,000; (8) Chemical products $4,000,000; (9) Paper and wood pulp $8,000,000; (10) Timber $2,600,000; (11) Wool and waste wool, fluff, and mixed hair yarn $4,000,000; (12) Unspecified aniline dyes and other coal tar dyes, synthetic indigo, and sulfide raw materials $3,600,000; (13) Rubber and products $3,000,000; (14) Lubricating oil $120,000; (15) Lubricating grease $5,000; (16) Oil wax grease $600,000; (17) Unspecified tanning paste $216,000; (18) Pharmaceuticals $800,000; (19) Passenger cars and jeeps (determined separately, no foreign exchange); (20) Motor trucks and long-distance buses (determined separately, no foreign exchange); (21) Developed film 16,000,000 meters (no foreign exchange).

<h3 id="e59">Closing of the Municipal Council General Assembly: The Process Was Peaceful and Smooth; The Speaker Expresses Satisfaction and Encourages Citizens to Support National Policy and Overcome Difficulties Together <a href="#e59" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c59" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">59</a></h3>
<p>[Report from this Newspaper] The seventh general assembly of the Municipal Council held its fifth meeting yesterday afternoon at 4:00 PM at the venue on Tanggu Road. Speaker Pan presided, with 140 councilors in attendance and more than 20 bureau chiefs and directors from the municipal government present. Jiang Jingguo, the city's economic supervisor, also attended as a guest and delivered a speech. The meeting discussed various proposals related to society, municipal government administration, matters referred by the mayor, matters referred by the speaker, and temporary motions. After the meeting, a ten-minute break was taken before the closing ceremony, which concluded successfully at 7:30 PM.</p>
<p>Speaker Pan delivered a closing speech, stating in brief: "The reason why this seventh general assembly was able to proceed so peacefully and smoothly is, in my opinion, not due to the council itself, but to the entire society. Because before and during the assembly, Shanghai had entered a state of stability, which refers to the stabilization of prices. This is something to be gratified about.</p>
<p>This Municipal Council General Assembly was scheduled to be held in October. The reason it was held earlier was due to the urging of the municipal government, because in June and July, the city's finances had reached their greatest difficulty, almost to the point of having no money for road repairs or garbage disposal. Since the central government promulgated the new economic measures plan, the city government's new budget and the adjustments to the property tax and municipal construction tax all awaited deliberation and approval by this council. This was also the most important matter of this assembly. The case has been reviewed and discussed several times by the Finance Subcommittee and the Review Committee. The merging of the property tax and municipal construction tax was approved, and the tax rate is much lower than that of the pre-war old Municipal Council and the French Municipal Council, and has also been reduced compared to the municipal government's original adjustment rate. I ask myself that this decision was made with due consideration to both the burden on citizens and the expenses of the municipal government. In addition, this assembly also approved a simplified tax collection procedure, which has also saved the municipal government a lot of manpower and resources, allowing the municipal government to barely maintain its operations in the future.</p>
<p>The current stability of prices in Shanghai is entirely due to the effective leadership of Supervisor Jiang and the strong cooperation of the city's military and police agencies. At the same time, it is also due to the support of the government by the people of the entire city. The large amount of gold notes exchanged by the Central Bank is sufficient proof. Recently, Shanghai, under the sincere cooperation of officials and civilians, can indeed be proud of itself and is worthy of being a model for the entire country. When we hear slogans from various places shouting "Learn from Shanghai!" "Learn from Shanghai!", we can see how important Shanghai is. I hope that President Jiang will effectively lead the people and the government to cooperate closely. We support the new economic plan promulgated by President Jiang and move towards the destination. The Municipal Council is willing to encourage citizens to overcome difficulties together and implement the new economic plan in the same direction."</p>
<h3 id="e60">The Mayor Points Out Two Major Tasks for the Council: Stabilizing Prices Will Be the Main Task in the Future <a href="#e60" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c60" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">60</a></h3>
<p>After the Speaker's speech, Mayor Wu delivered a speech, stating briefly: "I believe that the Municipal Council has two major tasks at present. One is to balance the income and expenditure of the municipal government, and the other is to assist the central government in stabilizing prices. In terms of balancing the budget, with the assistance of the council, the purpose of re-compiling the city's budget under mutual consideration has been achieved. I believe that this decision is reasonable and fair. Before the war, the city's annual budget was 46 million yuan, equivalent to 92 million gold yuan. The current city budget is only 50 million yuan, and the population has increased by 2 million. Citizens should understand that the council has indeed taken into account the citizens' ability to bear the burden. The main task in the future is to maintain the stability of prices. If prices fluctuate again, the city budget passed this time will be in vain. I hope that all sectors will cooperate to seek the permanent stability of society."</p>
<h3 id="e61">Supervisor Jiang's Speech: A Transition from Chaos to Stability Requires Sacrifice; Everything Still Requires the Cooperation and Assistance of Councilors <a href="#e61" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c61" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">61</a></h3>
<p>Then, Supervisor Jiang delivered a speech as a guest, stating briefly: "I have been ordered by President Yu to come to Shanghai to supervise currency reform and stabilize prices. When I was ordered, I had two feelings: (1) I was extremely excited to have the opportunity to live and cooperate with the people of Shanghai. (2) I was apprehensive about shouldering this important task because of my youth and lack of knowledge. But in the past three weeks, I have gained the greatest lesson: as long as you are with the people, you will not fail, you will only succeed. The experience of the past three weeks has strengthened my confidence in being able to succeed. The current stability of prices in Shanghai is a manifestation of the sincere support of the government by the entire city, and it is also the credit of the council and the municipal authorities for leading the people. I am very grateful. The current situation is still the beginning of our work, and there will be many difficulties in the future. However, I firmly believe that as long as all sectors cooperate, sincerely and earnestly, all difficulties can be overcome! What I hope most now is that the people and merchants of this city will never adopt a wait-and-see attitude again. In the future, there will be clear standards for the implementation of government decrees. The goodness or evil of merchants can be measured by this standard. Legal ones will be protected, and illegal ones will be severely punished, without any selfish prejudices. Recalling my service in Jiangxi, the first corrupt official to be shot was an old subordinate who had worked with me for four or five years. It is not that I have no personal feelings, but for the sake of the country and the people, I have to do this! The future work lies in the development of industry and commerce, because passively suppressing prices cannot last. Supporting industry and commerce is the only way to achieve stability. However, the transition from chaos to stability requires sacrifice. A temporary recession is unavoidable during the transition period. This can be compared to a fire. Although my house was not affected when the fire broke out, why was it demolished? It was to protect the houses of dozens or hundreds of families. So we have to look far ahead. If there is only today and no future, the sacrifice will naturally be in vain. This time, I have come to Shanghai to implement national policy and have always adhered to the unchanging concept, that is, to thoroughly implement the established policies, to seek their rationality, legality, and sentimentality, and at the same time to actively strive to stabilize prices and assist the development of industry and commerce. Everything still requires the cooperation and assistance of you councilors to overcome the difficult situation together and achieve the goal."</p>
<p>Finally, Deputy Speaker Xu delivered a reply on behalf of all councilors, hoping that Supervisor Jiang would assist the legitimate industrial and commercial sectors if they encounter difficulties in raw materials or production costs in the future, in order to jointly seek the stability of society. The meeting closed successfully at 7:30 PM.</p>

<p>[Report from this Newspaper] The case of Zhang Renyou, the chief of the Water Police Sub-Bureau of the Municipal Police Bureau, and others being accused of corruption, has taken a surprising turn since the Police Bureau transferred all case files to the District Prosecutor's Office on the 14th. Yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM, prosecutors Cao Hong and He Huimin interrogated the defendants. They believed that the case was extremely complex and continued to conduct separate and isolated investigations, which lasted for eight hours until 11:30 PM. After investigation, Zhang and Shan Guohua, the chief of the Suzhou River Police Station of the Water Sub-Bureau, and patrol officer Wang Baoqian were found to have committed serious crimes such as deliberately allowing bandit ships to pass. Therefore, the District Prosecutor's Office transferred the three to the Special Criminal Court for trial. Huang Boqian, the chief of the Fourth Section of the Water Sub-Bureau, and Xia Zhemin, a member of the Second Section, were also heavily suspected. The District Prosecutor's Office detained them.

However, all three stared blankly at the ceiling, furrowing their brows in deep thought, filled with anxiety and unease.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper Report] The Korean special envoy group, after visiting President Chiang in Beijing to pay their respects, returned to Shanghai the day before yesterday (the 14th) and is scheduled to depart for Manila this afternoon. Various circles in the city held a welcome meeting at the New Life Clubhouse on Weihaiwei Road yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM, with the participation of Korean Special Envoy Zhao Bingyu, Deputy Envoy Zheng, and Advisor Jin, along with Secretary Kim, totaling four individuals. Representing our side were Wu Guozhen, Pan Gongzhan, Fang Zhi, Chen Guokang, Feng Youzhen, and over a hundred representatives from various circles. Mayor Wu, serving as the chairman, delivered a welcome speech, stating that China and Korea are two major peace-loving nations in the world. In the past, Korea, failing to recognize Japan's ambition, was exploited by invaders. Today, with Japan defeated and Korea's independence restored, China's government and public are deeply gratified. The lesson of Japan's invasion of Korea demonstrates that imperialism relying on military aggression is destined to fail, with Japan serving as a cautionary tale. On behalf of all citizens of Shanghai, I extend my best wishes for the health of the special envoy group, the prosperity of Korea, and the early realization of world peace. Speaker Pan followed with a speech, expressing hope that Special Envoy Zhao would elaborate on how China and Korea should cooperate and support each other in the future, in order to jointly strive for world peace. If China and Korea sincerely cooperate, it will greatly contribute to stabilizing East Asia. Chairman Fang Xikong, in his speech, expressed the hope that Korean expatriates in Shanghai would establish closer ties with the citizens of Shanghai to enhance friendship. After speeches by Wu, Pan, and Fang, Special Envoy Zhao stood up and delivered a sincere speech, expressing his warm gratitude for the welcome from all sectors. He stated that his visit to China was solely to represent the Korean President and people in expressing gratitude to the President and people of China, as your country's resolute recognition of the Korean government deserves our heartfelt thanks. The goodwill of your country towards Korea for the past two thousand years has created a deep emotional debt that we have long felt unable to repay. Over the past forty years, Korea's</p>
<p>independence movement has been deeply influenced by Mr. Sun Yat-sen of your country. During Japan's rule over Korea, many Koreans fled to your country and received favorable treatment and assistance. Your government and Kuomintang members provided much protection to Korean revolutionaries. In the United Nations General Assembly, your representatives consistently and fully supported Korea's independence, with President Chiang being the first to declare support for Korea's independence. The realization of Korea's independence is entirely dependent on your country's support. However, looking to Korea's future, crises loom on all sides. The Korean people are not only satisfied with organizing a government today but also wish to further achieve true unification. Today,</p>
<p>the expansion of international communism poses many difficulties to the establishment of the Republic of Korea. The emergence of the North Korean government was entirely created by Stalinist dictators. We must overthrow it. South Korea has twenty million people. In the general election on May 10 of this year, 93% expressed confidence in the government and are willing to unite with peace-loving people around the world to complete Korea's independent unification. To achieve this ideal, we sincerely hope that the people and government of your country will continue to assist us. The chairman just said that both China and Korea are peace-loving nations, which is entirely true. Between China and Korea, not only are customs and habits</p>
<p>similar in many respects, but the faces of the people also resemble each other. Considering the current situation of China and Korea, we already face a common problem. Your President once said that if Korea cannot be independent, China will be threatened. Therefore, he sincerely hopes that the two great nations of China and Korea can</p>
<p>strive together and advance side by side in the future. Our delegation is grateful for the lion brocade banners presented by all sectors of Shanghai during this visit to China. Special Envoy Zhao's speech was translated section by section by Mr. Chen Guolian. The hall resounded with applause after the speech. Finally, Chairman Fang led everyone in chanting slogans such as "Long Live the Republic of China" and "Long Live the Republic of Korea." The grand meeting ended joyfully at 4:15 PM.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper Report] The shortage of Western medicines has remained quite serious in recent days, especially with penicillin and other drugs being even more difficult to obtain. In addition to merchants hoarding and refusing to sell, it has also been reported that some doctors are colluding with scalpers, deliberately writing out large prescriptions for scalpers to acquire valuable Western medicines from various pharmacies. In view of this, the Health Bureau convened relevant units such as the Western medicine industry in its conference room yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM to discuss how to 疏導important medicines and other issues.</p>
<h3 id="e74">Case of Off-Exchange Sales of Yong Spinning Shares, Lin Legeng and Others Undergo Preliminary Hearing Yesterday, Du Weiping Claims He Never Inquired About Matters Within the Company <a href="#e74" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c74" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">74</a></h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Report] Stockbrokers Lin Legeng, Du Weiping, Tao Liguolan, Xu Yang Shuyao, etc., were previously prosecuted by the District Prosecutor's Office for violating the Exchange Law. The District Court held a collegiate panel yesterday afternoon at 2:00 PM in the second court, with Presiding Judge Shen Tianbao and Judges Mei Erhe and Fang Xianghai, to conduct the preliminary hearing. Defendant Du Weiping stated two points in court: First, the Hongxing Securities Firm and Huamei Industrial Trading Company he established separately hired Qiu Yunfeng and Sun Shuren to manage internal and external affairs. He trusted them to handle all matters, large and small. He personally rarely visited the firm to inquire about business, only receiving reports from the two on the firm's profits and losses. Furthermore, from August 11th to 20th, he had sores on his legs and was bedridden at home, with medical proof, and did not even visit the firm once. He was not familiar with the situation in the industry and had even instructed Qiu not to engage in off-exchange transactions. He had never discussed matters with Lin Legeng, Li Guolan, Yang Shuyao, etc. Second, the indictment from the District Prosecutor's Office stated that he had continuously engaged in off-exchange transactions and sold large quantities of shares since August 16th. He had already fully confessed to this during questioning by the Municipal Police Bureau. This statement is completely inaccurate. On the 2nd of this month, when he was summoned by the Municipal Police Bureau, he asked Qiu Yunfeng to accompany him to the bureau for questioning, as he was not familiar with the firm's business operations. He stated at the bureau, "I don't know anything about the situation in the firm, please ask Mr. Qiu." The police record of the interrogation did not differentiate between his testimony and Qiu's testimony, attributing all statements to "Du's answer." The record was not reviewed by him after the questioning, and he later learned that there had been significant alterations to the original statements. Therefore, it cannot be considered his testimony. Du concluded by stating, "Please conduct a thorough investigation of this case. If I have violated the law, I should be punished. Otherwise, please handle it impartially in accordance with the spirit of judicial independence."</p>
<p>Du and Lin Calm, Li Fat, Yang Thin</p>
<p>During yesterday's court session, approximately 500 family members and friends of the defendants were in attendance. The courtroom, which could accommodate over a hundred people, was filled to capacity. The remaining attendees were lined up along the staircases, and those who arrived later watched from the open space in the courtyard. The District Court dispatched multiple bailiffs to maintain order. The defendants were transported from the Masnan Road District Court Detention Center at noon and temporarily rested in the waiting room of the second court before the trial began. Du and Lin were both wearing grey mesh shirts. Du's leg injury had not fully healed, and he moved with slight difficulty, but his expression remained calm as usual. Tao Liguolan, healthy and plump, wore a silk cheongsam with a white base and small red flowers, looking around the court as if nothing was amiss. Xu Yang Shuyao, frail and seemingly unable to withstand the wind, wore a black cheongsam and a light yellow sweater, her brow furrowed in thought, appearing very worried. At 2:00 PM, the trial commenced, and the defendants faced the court in order. Chinese and foreign photographers took numerous pictures. China Electric also sent personnel to film the newsreel, but the District Court, citing a lack of precedent, halted the filming midway.</p>
<p>Rumors of Currency Reform Persist</p>
<p>After inquiring about the age, origin, and address of each defendant, the prosecutor Ding Tongjun stood up and read aloud the indictment. Presiding Judge Shen then began the interrogation. Du first stated: The Hongxing Securities Firm has been established for over a year, initially as a partnership, and is now solely owned. The Huamei Industrial Trading Company has been established for over two years. Both companies have separate managers, and he personally does not manage the actual business operations. To his knowledge, Hongxing has never engaged in off-exchange transactions, only acting as an agent for buying and selling. The rest of his statement was as described above. After the statement, the court allowed him to rest in a seat next to the stand due to his illness. When Lin Legeng was asked to testify, he stated: He is currently a broker-manager at number 190. On August 16th, he purchased 16 million shares of Yong Spinning from Hongxing, but the transaction was later cancelled due to insufficient funds. This point was not asked during the police interrogation, so it was not recorded. He had never shorted shares before, nor engaged in off-exchange transactions. He did not know Li Guolan or Yang Shuyao, and was not aware of any news regarding currency reform. When the court questioned Tao Li Guolan, she stated: She has been married to Tao Qiming for seven years. Two months ago, her family moved from Taiwan to Shanghai. Her husband went to Beijing to work in the Ministry of Finance and frequently returns to Shanghai. Since moving from Taiwan to Shanghai, she has not engaged in stock trading. Her husband returned to Shanghai on August 18th to visit his sick mother and then immediately went to Beijing, without informing her of any news regarding currency reform. Because her brother Li Boqin mentioned stock trading, she invited Xu Yang Shuyao to go to Huamei at 9:25 AM on August 19th. Due to the market downturn, the three of them each sold 2 million shares, earning approximately 2 billion yuan, which they repurchased at the closing bell. At this point, the court asked her why she went to Huamei, since Huamei is not a securities firm.</p>
<h3 id="e75">Lu Lianjing and Two Others Indicted, Lin Legeng Also Implicated in Another Case <a href="#e75" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c75" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">75</a></h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Report] Lu Lianjing, a native of Liyang and broker at number 190 in room 412 of the Securities Building on Jiujiang Road, has long been engaged in off-exchange transactions, which drew the attention of the Security Command's inspectors. On July 5th (Monday) of this year, when personnel from the Security Command monitoring the stock market inspected room 412, Zhou Chuanlin (i.e., Zhou Shoulun), claiming to be from Guangxin Bank, inquired about the off-exchange price of Yong Spinning shares and stated that a client needed to sell 1 million shares of Yong Spinning stock. The inspector replied that he was willing to buy them at 6,500 yuan (the daily price limit for the spinning factory was only 6,300 yuan). Zhou indicated that he was willing to sell at that price. At that time, the manager of the firm, Lin Legeng, also called, and the inspector pretended to be an employee of the firm and asked if the aforementioned transaction should be accepted. Lin replied that it could be accepted and that the off-exchange interest rate was 374 to 380 yuan. The Security Command, believing that Lu and others were indeed engaged in off-exchange transactions, reported it to the Shanghai Securities Exchange Supervisor's Office of the Ministry of Finance, which forwarded it to the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, ordering the revocation of their business license, copying the certificate documents, and transferring the case to the District Prosecutor's Office for investigation. Furthermore, Lin Legeng testified in court, "When Du Weiping asked his manager Qiu Yunfeng to come to room 412, I sold 16 million shares of Yong Spinning, which were also entrusted to our firm for sale." This, along with the testimonies of Lu, Zhou, and others, confirmed the fact of the off-exchange transactions by the defendants. The investigation of the case has concluded. Except for the portion involving Lin Legeng, which has been prosecuted separately, Lu, Zhou, and Qiu have been indicted for violating the Exchange Law.</p>
<p>Mei to Huamei to sell. Li stated that she and Yang Shuyao had dealings with Huamei and had opened an account there, so they went to Huamei and asked Hongxing to sell the shares. She had no intention of doing so that day, but unexpectedly this caused trouble. The court inquired that according to the investigation, at 7:00 AM on the 19th, two women were waiting at Huamei until it opened, and then they immediately entered to sell shares, "are those the two of you?" Li laughed and replied, "There is no such fool in the world."</p>
<p>Xu Yang Shuyao Commits Crime Confusedly</p>
<p>Finally, Xu Yang Shuyao testified: She has been married to Xu Zhuanghuai for five years and had not engaged in stock trading before. At 9:30 AM on August 19th, she went to Huamei with Li Guolan. The door was already open, so she first sold 1 million shares, and then sold another 1 million shares due to the market downturn. She did not know Lin Du, etc., before. Her husband came to Shanghai once on August 14th and did not inform her of any news regarding currency reform. She stated: "I don't understand stock trading. Li Guolan invited me, so I went with her and confusedly committed a crime without knowing what was happening." The court then summoned witnesses Qiu Yunfeng and Hu Zengda (the former being the manager of Hongxing Securities Firm, and the latter being an employee of the firm). Neither of them appeared in court. The defense lawyers for the defendants then successively argued their cases. The court, noting that the witnesses had not appeared, ordered a postponement and instructed the defendants' lawyers to have the witnesses Qiu Yunfeng, Hu Zengda, and Sun Shuren summoned for questioning at the next hearing. The requests for bail by Lin Legeng, Tao Li Guolan, and Xu Yang Shuyao were denied.</p>
<p>(Another Report) The case will be reopened for a second hearing in a few days.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper Report] The city's inspection authorities recently uncovered a major case of collusion between officials and merchants in private foreign exchange racketeering and smuggling of goods prohibited by the government. As the case is still developing, the investigating agency has declined to release details. However, according to information obtained by reporters from relevant sources, the organization appears to be an ordinary Western medicine shop on the surface, using the operation of Western medicine as a cover. In reality, they were using foreign exchange racketeering methods to smuggle prohibited imported goods for sale on the black market at high prices, thereby obtaining exorbitant profits. After receiving the aforementioned tip, the inspection authorities secretly investigated and, upon obtaining incriminating evidence, took action and discovered evidence of collusion with officials from a certain agency in the documents seized from the Western medicine shop. After consulting the Shanghai District Economic Control Supervisor's Office, the inspection authorities detained the suspected officials and merchants, who are currently under interrogation.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper Report] The Shanghai District Economic Supervisor's Office recently telegraphed the city government stating, "Recently, various goods in the city have been traded on the black market, which must be strictly prohibited. Hereafter, any black market transactions discovered should result in the confiscation or purchase of the goods, depending on the severity of the circumstances.

<p>Yesterday, the Economic Police Brigade of the Police Bureau, acting on a tip, uncovered a case of using business exports to illegally trade Hong Kong currency at the Huaxin Shenzhuang at number 14 Yongshou Lane, Yunnan Road, Ningbo Road. They seized confidential documents and account books related to foreign exchange racketeering to and from various locations, as well as seven gold ingots (weighing seven taels), seventy-two silver coins, seventy-one auxiliary coins, seventy-six US dollars, forty-one and a half Siamese baht, and one hundred and thirty Hong Kong dollars. The manager of the firm, Xu Kejun, was taken to the bureau for interrogation. Huaxin Shenzhuang specializes in exporting books, stationery, and cotton textiles, with a broad scope covering the South Seas Islands, Singapore, Siam, Penang, Hong Kong, and other places. It has branches and offices in the aforementioned locations, including Hong Kong Huatong Company, Singapore China Trading Company, Siam Nanyang Bookstore, Huaxin Zhuang Agency, Penang Mingming Bookstore, Huaxin Zhuang Agency, etc. Hong Kong Huatong Company is managed by Xu Bochao, the son of the firm's manager Xu Kejun. Operating funds from Singapore, Siam, Penang, and other places, as well as small remittances entrusted by overseas Chinese, are transferred by Huatong and secretly settled by Hong Kong Tao Heng and Guang'an Banks for black market exchange to the Shanghai firm, with monthly remittances to Shanghai via the black market amounting to approximately 20,000 gold yuan based on the gold yuan exchange rate. The police bureau uncovered this case based on clues from a secret telegram sent from Hong Kong to Shanghai by the firm.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper Report] The center of the new Pacific typhoon reached 23.5 degrees north latitude and 124.5 degrees east longitude yesterday afternoon, in the ocean east of the Ryukyu Islands and Taiwan. The speed is very slow, and the direction is northwest by north. Taipei had force 5 winds last night. Today, the Taiwan Strait and the southern East China Sea will be shrouded in strong winds and rain. Because the typhoon's speed is very slow, it is still difficult to determine whether the city will be within the affected area. However, according to the Meteorological Observatory's forecast, the upcoming Mid-Autumn Festival will likely be spent in haze, and "raising a toast to the bright moon will be impossible," which will greatly disappoint citizens.

<h3 id="e87">Henan People Have Taken Up a Heavy Burden <a href="#e87" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c87" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">87</a></h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent of This Newspaper, Ling Songshou</p>
<p>Since the early days of the War of Resistance, when the Yellow River breach at Huayuankou prevented the enemy from advancing westward, Henan people have had a saying: "Merit to the country, disaster to the locality." When talking about the suffering of the Henan people, these two sentences are always mentioned. Naturally, in the current situation of suppressing the rebellion, the Central Plains has been engulfed in boundless flames of war and has become a decisive main battlefield. The Henan people are, of course, once again bearing this sacred and heavy burden under the circumstances of "merit to the country, disaster to the locality"!</p>
<p>People who are concerned about the war situation in the Central Plains will certainly know how many points can be controlled within Henan Province today. However, apart from the Henan people, people will never know how much grain, labor, and apportionment the Henan people have to bear today in the government-controlled areas of dots and lines.</p>
<p>Taking Zhengzhou as an example, from November last year to June this year, the things taken from the people of Zhengzhou through the Zhengzhou County Government are as follows:</p>
<p>Procurement of military and public grain: 29,164,842 catties.</p>
<p>Procurement of firewood: 15,884,374 catties.</p>
<p>Procurement of bran: 4,455,665 catties.</p>
<p>Conscription of carts: 1,722 vehicles.</p>
<p>Purchase of green bricks: 9,310,000 pieces.</p>
<p>Purchase of lime: 5,641,000 catties.</p>
<p>Purchase of round logs: 71,231 pieces.</p>
<p>Purchase of planks: 2,133 square feet.</p>
<p>Borrowing of furniture: 5,110 pieces.</p>
<p>(The compensation for the above items totals 33,351,234,800 yuan).</p>
<p>The purchase price of more than 33.3 billion yuan listed above is still calculated according to the prices from more than two months ago. Now, it will inevitably have to be multiplied several times.</p>
<p>These grains or funds are, of course, apportioned to the people. For shops, ordinary shops have to pay several dan of grain each month, and more have to pay more than ten or dozens of dan. For farmland, the annual grain production per mu in Zhengzhou villages is about 150 to 200 catties. The entire year's harvest is completely paid off in one apportionment. Zhengzhou is now an isolated island. How much business can shops do in a month? Under this situation, shops are considered to have reached their end. In 1946, Zhengzhou had more than 2,000 shops, but now less than a quarter of them remain. As for the farmland, after a year of hard work, the result is still losing money. Who would be so foolish as to do this? Since it cannot be sold, it can only be left barren. People go elsewhere to find ways to make a living, so there is a lot of barren land in Zhengzhou now. However, these are not the core of the problem. Whether or not the people can afford to pay is secondary. The main thing is where to get almost 30 million catties of military and public grain in eight months? Let's not talk about how much of the area within Zhengzhou can be controlled, let's just say that it can all be controlled. The people of Zhengzhou will never admit that Zhengzhou's annual grain production will be even half of 30 million catties.</p>
<p>Grain requisition in Henan has long been a</p>
<p>terrifying term. In March of this year, the Henan Provincial Assembly's delegation to Beijing spent 52 days to appeal, and only in May did they get permission to exempt all previous unpaid grain. After the Battle of Kaifeng, it was rumored in Henan that the central government had approved that military grain would no longer be requisitioned in Henan, but this news does not seem to have been confirmed, because the requisition of military grain in Henan recently is still as urgent as fire.</p>

<p>Continued Expansion of Accommodation for Child Refugees</p>
<p>[Our Qingdao Bureau, 13th] As a result of continuous planning by the Qingdao authorities, new measures have been taken for the refugees, children, and students who have fled to Qingdao: (1) Of the more than 2,000 refugee students, 800 will be selected to participate in public work relief projects, while the remaining thousand will be divided into teams to engage in social services such as refugee surveys, economic inspections, and voluntary guarding of public forests. These refugee students engaged in such services will be provided with food and clothing by the authorities, working half-time and studying half-time. (2) Among the more than 40,000 refugees, 25,000 of the elderly, weak, women, and children who cannot survive without assistance will be identified and issued food tickets. The remaining young and strong refugees will be given the opportunity to participate in cleaning the city and building the docks in exchange for wages. (3) The various refugee child accommodation institutions will be unified, and accommodation will continue to be expanded. Furthermore, Ms. Morel, a representative of the Joint Emergency Children's Aid organization stationed in Qingdao, arrived in Qingdao yesterday and began working at the former site of the Municipal Government's Civil Affairs Bureau on the 13th.</p>

The original review opinions from the review committee were approved. For the sake of convenient implementation, the Ministry of Industry and Commerce has made some supplementary explanations and distributed them to power plants nationwide for compliance. The original review opinions and supplementary explanations are recorded below:</p>
<p>A. Original Review Opinions: (1) The prices of goods or services provided by public utilities should remain temporarily frozen at the prices of August 19th. The coal required by public utilities should continue to be supplied at the prices of August. (2) If the agreed price of a certain enterprise was determined long before August 19th and the cost has increased significantly, it is proposed to allow adjustments in accordance with Articles 3 and 15 of the Measures for Managing Finance and Strengthening Economic Control. The competent authorities should supervise the enterprises to improve management, increase efficiency, and save on waste. They should strictly verify costs, formulate adjustment price measures, and submit the proposed measures for approval, adopting a tiered pricing system to reduce the burden on ordinary people. (3) The financial management of various public utilities should be properly organized, and overdue payments should be actively collected to maintain self-sufficiency. If necessary, half a month's fee can be collected from users in advance at the August price. (4) The prices of various public utilities, transportation industries, and their required oil and coal are interconnected. It is proposed that the Yuan periodically convene relevant agencies for discussions to establish connections.</p>
<p>B. Supplementary Explanation: (1) Regarding the first point of the original review opinions, "The fuel required by public utilities should also continue to be supplied at the supply price of August," the ministry has telegraphed the Shanghai Fuel Management Committee. The Executive Yuan's meeting decided that the purchase and sale prices of coal used by public utilities and railways in September should be based on the purchase price of August 1st. The remaining coal allocation will be handled according to the price of August 16th. (2) According to the principle of the second point of the original review, the electricity prices of all power plants should be strictly verified for cost by the ministry, and the adjustment measures and prices should be formulated and submitted to the Yuan for approval before being implemented through a circular telegram. (3) The third point of the original review opinions, "If necessary, half a month's fee can be collected from users in advance at the August price," should be supplemented as follows: "The electricity bills for September (i.e., October fees) should be pre-collected at half the amount of the August electricity bills. The electricity bills for August (i.e., September fees) should still be collected according to the August (i.e., July electricity) fees."</p>

<p>[Our Kunming Bureau, 13th] The Sichuan-Yunnan-Xikang Border Affairs Committee has recently formulated a plan for governing the Yi people, the main contents of which are: (1) Adopting the principle of ethnic equality, with equality between Han and Yi, and jointly suppressing border bandits. (2) Adopting a policy of education and progress. (3) Focusing on politics and supplementing with military force. (4) Establishing Yi governance agencies in various regions. (5) Adopting separate laws and special curriculums to manage and educate border residents. (6) Combining management, education, health, and defense. (7) Protecting human rights, equalizing land rights, and eliminating the slave system. (8) Using a system of military reclamation and immigration to build villages to stabilize border areas and resolve hidden dangers among the Bai Yi people. This plan has been adopted by the central government and will be gradually implemented in the spring. Furthermore, since the Bai Yi people in western Yunnan brewed independence, the authorities have decided to reform the Tusi system in the southwestern border areas. Because the Tusi hereditary system of generations has been oppressing the common people, there is no law and no discipline. In addition to wholeheartedly supporting this new measure, border compatriots immediately sent representatives to Kunming to present their opinions to the government.</p>

The Ministry of National Defense has transferred this matter to the Kangding Provincial Government for handling. The provincial government has formulated joint implementation measures for organizing the people.</p>

<p>[Our Chengde Bureau, 13th] Although Rehe is currently suffering from anemia, it has countless mineral deposits. Over a thousand large and small deposits were exploited during the enemy puppet period. Gold and coal are produced within the Chengde defense line, and the quality is excellent. The daily output of gold mines reached 50 to 70 market taels during the enemy puppet period, but coal mines were not exploited. Recently, the military and political authorities, in order to solve the problem of winter fuel and develop financial resources, and to assist the border areas in suppressing the rebellion, have decided to use the method of providing work in exchange for food to start coal mining in the second half of the month. The gold mine requires a fund of 100,000 gold yuan. According to the land management department's planning, the possible daily output is 25 market taels. However, it is difficult to raise the fund, and the provincial government plans to apply for a loan from the central government. If these two items are successful, Rehe will not only be able to save itself, but also help the country.</p>

<h3 id="e114">Rice Prices Remain Weak, Oil and Flour Strengthen <a href="#e114" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c114" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">114</a></h3>
<p>The rice market has not escaped its weak situation, and prices have not changed. There are not many goods, and the sales path is still dull, and transactions are quiet. Prices in the southern city market have not increased or decreased, and the prices of each stall remain at the original prices of the previous day. The prices of early white japonica rice and early thin rice in the northern city market also remain at the original prices. However, new Du Xian rice continues to arrive, and the price is 3 jiao lower. Special high japonica rice has also dropped by 2 jiao. Jiao Bai Xian rice opened at 19 yuan. Yesterday's registered arrivals were 1,033 shi in the southern city and 1,288 shi in the northern city.</p>
<p>Flour: Slightly strengthened, because wheat is scarce, manufacturers have little supply to the market. Moreover, because the export of materials can be applied for, people's hearts are firm, and the opening price of warship flour was 7 yuan and 1 jiao, and the closing price was 7 yuan, 1 jiao, and 5 fen, an increase of 3 fen. Old car flour has not opened, and can flour has strengthened by 6 fen, with a transaction price of 7 yuan and 2 jiao. Brand-name flours such as Lighthouse flour have unanimously increased by 5 fen. Iron skin has slightly increased by 4 fen. Manufacturers have already opened small packages of iron skin.</p>
<p>Miscellaneous Grains: The market remains weak, but soybeans temporarily strengthened before closing. Because the oil cake rose, manufacturers accepted the last 11 yuan and 8 jiao for vehicle beans, an increase of 3 to 4 jiao. Cowhide soybeans increased by a small 2 jiao. Corn declined by 3 jiao because the sales path in the north has been reduced. Red sorghum is not accepted by the client, and the market has declined by 2 jiao. Broad beans and green beans are stable.

<p>Yesterday's money supply was still extremely loose. Moreover, because the Supervisor's Office issued the "Measures for Applying for Permits to Transport Materials for Export," allowing materials to be exported conditionally, the market has improved across the board, and the money supply has become very loose.</p>
<p>Yesterday, banks and bank drafts still reported a net difference of 2.12 million yuan in clearing, including 1.69 million yuan from the Central Bank, 530,000 yuan from the Bank of China, 740,000 yuan received by the Bank of Communications, 440,000 yuan from the Farmers Bank, 110,000 yuan from the China Trust Bureau, 40,000 yuan received by the Postal Remittance Bureau, 130,000 yuan from the Central Cooperative Bank, 1.25 million yuan received by Shang Rong Bank, 740,000 yuan received by small clearing houses, and a total of 150,000 yuan received by foreign merchants.</p>

<p>Since the transfer of deposits by commercial banks began on the 13th, it has not been enthusiastic so far. As of the 15th, only 33 banks, money shops, and trust companies have made the transfer. The number of trust companies is the smallest, and no insurance companies have made the transfer. The major banks in the city, such as Shanghai, Zhejiang Xingye, Zhejiang Shiye, Xinhua, and Jincheng, have all made the transfer. The total number of transfers will be announced by the Ministry of Finance.</p>
<p>Also: According to Lin Chongyong, director of the Gold Control Bureau, the reporting situation of the major commercial banks in Shanghai has been very good so far. The declared amounts of the five major banks, such as Shanghai, Zhongnan, Jincheng, and Xinxing, have totaled 20 million US dollars. However, the declared amounts of some small and medium-sized banks are extremely small, which is suspected of concealment. The central government has ordered each bank to re-report and has set a deadline of this week. If they still fail to report by the deadline, the bureau will conduct a thorough investigation of their assets and will severely punish them according to law.</p>

Chairman Wang reported on the association's joint yarn allocation and the distribution of the first phase of U.S. aid cotton.</p>
<p>Following that, the council proceeded to discuss the following matters: (1) The Shanghai Industrial Association sent a letter to the Cotton Spinning Association, advocating that, in support of the government's currency reform policy, all associations should hand over their gold, U.S. dollar yarn, and foreign exchange to the national bank, and requesting them to handle this matter. Resolution: To support the national policy, notify all member factories that anyone holding gold, banknotes, or foreign exchange should declare it according to the law.</p>
<p>(2) It was resolved to appoint Liu Jingji, Shao Baohu, and Huang Chunfang to review matters related to member applications for permits to transport raw materials and supplies, to ensure due diligence.</p>
<p>(3) It was decided to appoint Liu Jingji as a member of the National Cotton Joint Purchasing Committee, with Wu Dingsheng, Tong Runfu, Han Zhiming, Zhang Wenjin, Rong Guangliang, and others assisting him.</p>
<p>(4) The key points regarding the National Cotton Joint Purchasing Office were adopted, requesting approval from the National Cotton Joint Purchasing Committee: (A) All domestically produced cotton within the Shanghai city area must be uniformly collected by the Joint Purchasing Office, and factories are not allowed to collect it privately. (B) The joint purchasing price should be determined with reference to the price at the place of origin, transportation costs, and reasonable profit. (C) Factories are free to decide whether or not to participate, but factories that do not participate are still not allowed to purchase domestically produced cotton within the Shanghai city area. (D) Factories participating in the Joint Purchasing Office must prepay a fund, the amount of which will be determined freely by each factory. (E) The fund allocated by the Central Bank is equivalent to the total amount of funds paid by the national and private yarn factories. (F) All funds will be used to purchase domestically produced cotton, which will be allocated once every week or half month. However, the portion of domestically produced cotton purchased with the fund allocated by the Central Bank will be used in a cotton-for-yarn exchange program, with commissioned spinning and weaving. (G) Factories establishing cotton collection agencies in other areas may still collect cotton and transport it to the factory for their own use, but they must comply with local price limits. (H) A joint purchasing branch office will be established in Hankou, with the same nature as the headquarters.

<p>Registration Begins on the 20th</p>
<p>The Chengyou Cup Basketball League, hosted by the Chengyou Group of the Shanghai YMCA Sports Department, has a history of seven years. This year is the eighth year.

It was immediately resolved to amend the league regulations. In addition to adding a clause that once a team's players are registered, they cannot be added, subtracted, or replaced, the rest remain the same. In order to improve the health and hygiene of the players, it was decided to provide the players with hot water for bathing no matter how difficult it is. If the fees are insufficient, the committee members will share the supplement and advance the funds to purchase coal. Registration will begin on the 20th of this month and end at the end of the month. Each team will pay a registration fee (including bathing) of ten gold yuan, a deposit of ten yuan, and a protest fee of twenty yuan each time. The opening date is scheduled to start on October 11th, starting at 5:30 PM on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays. There will be three games each day. The location is the gymnasium of the Buxianqiao YMCA. Any newly formed teams wishing to participate must apply first and be approved by the committee before they can register. Teams participating in the league must be teams of adult members of the YMCA. Other non-member teams may be invited by the League Committee. The League is divided into Group A and Group B. The qualifications are determined by the committee. The League will adopt the basketball rules promulgated by the Seventh National Games. Each group will use a single round-robin system.

<p>Linshan Tennis, Cold Games Emerge One After Another; American Youth Kehill Loses Three Straight to An Bang</p>
<p>[United Press, Linshan, 14th] Three cold games emerged on the 14th of the Linshan tennis competition. South African player Sturgess defeated American Taipei Cup player Tai Tuot by 5-7, 6-4, 6-2, 1-6, 6-4 and advanced to the top sixteen of the semi-finals. Another cold game was Carter of San Francisco, who defeated last year's runner-up Tom Brown in three straight sets by 6-4, 6-3, 6-4. At the same time, Australian Taipei Cup player Xue Dewei was defeated by Layson in four games by 4-6, 6-2, 8-6, 6-4. Filipino player An Bang won three consecutive games, but in the fourth week of the competition, he was defeated by Kehill of San Francisco in three straight sets by 6-2, 6-0, 6-2. According to experts, this 24-year-old youth Kehill of San Francisco has the potential to create unexpected and amazing events. Kehill's all-round advantage, sharp backhand, and powerful forehand shots made the small and lean An Bang run around the court and unable to cope. An Bang's online performance was defeated by Kehill's accurate sideline balls. Kehill rarely played online, and mostly attacked from the baseline.</p>

<p>The registration for the second Silver Coin Cup Team Table Tennis Championship, sponsored by the Silver Coin Industry Association of this city, has already begun. More than ten teams from banks such as China Farmers, Siming, Jin Cheng, China Yellow, China Blue, China White, Donglai, Pudong, Xinhua, and Jiangsu Province have already registered to participate. The runner-up from the previous tournament, Zhe Xing, is still considering. The champion from the previous tournament, the Bank of China, is organizing three teams to participate, which will make the competition even more intense. However, the bank's top chop-shot player, Yuan Jingyun, has been transferred out of town on official business, significantly weakening their strength, which may make it difficult for them to retain the championship. This is a good opportunity for various teams to compete for the championship. Registration for the tournament will close on the 20th of this month. The competition rules have also been printed. Banks and firms are welcome to form teams and participate in this grand event. Eligibility: All table tennis teams organized by banks, money houses, and trust companies in this city are eligible to register. Registration is open from now until the 20th, from 9:00 AM to 7:00 PM daily, at the Association. Each team should submit a registration fee of one gold yuan and a deposit of five gold yuan.

<h3 id="e142">Autumn Wind <a href="#e142" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c142" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">142</a></h3>
<p>— He Ku</p>
<p>Although the midday sun still has a bit of its "rampant" residual heat, after all, the Mid-Autumn Festival is approaching, and gradually, a bit of coolness is felt between morning and evening. In the evening, I lean against the south window to express my pride, and a half-moon shines perfectly on the couch by the window. The autumn wind blows gently, bringing a refreshing feeling. With the passing of the wind, a rustling sound comes from the nearby leaves. The leaves begin to wither, and often, in the blink of an eye, one feels a longing for their hometown. Zhang Han, the Grand Commandant under King Jiong of Qi, thought of reed shoots when the autumn wind blew and said very elegantly, "Life values contentment; how can one be tied down by officialdom thousands of miles away for the sake of fame and rank?"</p>
<p>What I think is missing in modern people compared to the ancients is this kind of generous spirit. Zhang Jiying could go home and enjoy his leisure when he found his job as a civil servant dull. Modern people are not like that. They know that the meat is not plump, just a bone, but they can only gnaw on it and not let go. If you become chic and want to "fulfill your ambitions" and return to your hometown, don't talk about lacking the beauty of a reed shoot, even the bone is gone. On the other hand, there are a hundred people eager to pursue the bone that has been abandoned, satisfied with a single gnaw. From this perspective, it is not the sorrow of modern people, the so-called daily squeeze of livelihood.</p>
<p>Speaking of livelihood, indeed, when the autumn wind rises, one feels the situation is serious. In order to maintain the necessary warmth of the body, thin clothes must be replaced, but today, it is really difficult to add new clothes. In a tailor shop on Beijing West Road, an ordinary suit costs 120 yuan. You and I may be able to spend a month's income to buy a suit, but often, one side is supported while the other collapses, and the food at home has to be put on hold. Some people say that Liang Dangxuan's "The whole family is in the west wind, and winter clothes have not been cut in October" is pretentious, trying to knock a bamboo stick. Considering the situation today, unless one makes do and wears old clothes, it is really beyond the ability of ordinary people to have the whole family tailor new clothes. But Shanghai's fashion stores are as numerous as bamboo shoots after the rain, and each one is booming with business and filled with ladies. If we simply magnify this part of the picture, Huang Zhongze's poems are simply shabby and not worth a glance.</p>
<p>That being said, as far as the scenery of nature is concerned, when the autumn wind rises, the scenery is truly extraordinary. At this time, the colors in nature, although not as good as the spring light in March, are just transitioning from brilliance to plainness, still carrying a bit of the afterglow of brilliance. I will never forget the sailboats and sandpipers on the Qiantang River at this time, the rippling water, and the clear, blue river flowing all the way to the distant mountains. The so-called "Fishermen's houses on the river dip in the water, idle clouds linger by the mossy rocks" in the Sword South Poetry Collection can outline a bit of the scenery of the Qiantang River at this time.</p>
<p>Therefore, when the autumn wind rises, it is indeed a suitable season for travel. Although life is inevitably subject to the torment of life, one should ultimately break free from the shackles of torment and appreciate the scenery of nature. This is at least much better than chasing fame and fortune, because the latter is only the satisfaction of ambition and the senses, while the former is what can obtain the "fulfillment of ambition" of the soul. Lu Fangweng said, "Despite poverty, still buy books." In fact, under the principle of "despite poverty," both buying books and traveling are worth trying.</p>
<h3 id="e143">Remembering the Lü Bicheng Sisters (Part 1) <a href="#e143" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c143" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">143</a></h3>
<p>— Lu Danlin</p>
<p>Yesterday, I read Mr. Chen Yixian's "Remembering Ms. Lü Meisun," and I learned that he thought of Lü Meisun because of my "Remembering Ms. Lü Bicheng." Regarding Ms. Lü's father and the trivial matters of her sisters, I will supplement what I know below.</p>
<p>Ms. Lü's father, Lü Fengqi, styled Ruitian, was a native of Jingde. He was a successful candidate in the provincial examination in the gengwu year of the Tongzhi reign (1870) and a jinshi in the dingchou year of the Guangxu reign (1877). He was assigned to the Hanlin Academy as a compiler. In the renwu year (1882), he served as the Educational Commissioner of Shanxi. He authored the "Jingran Zhai Poetry Collection," which is described in Chen Ziyan's (poem) edited "Anhui Elegant Initial Collection." Then there is Lü Meisun's description: "After my late father passed the imperial examinations, he filled the post of tutor in the Jingshan Palace. In the jiaxu year (1874), he passed the examination to be a secretary of the Grand Secretariat. In the dingchou year of the Guangxu reign (1877), he paid homage to the emperor and was reassigned to the Hanlin Academy as a shujishi (probationary academician). He was soon appointed as a compiler, successively filling the posts of drafter in the academy, co-editor of the National History Institute, and compiler of the Imperial Genealogy Hall. In the renwu year (1882), he was appointed as the Educational Commissioner of Shanxi. After completing his term, he requested to retire due to illness and moved to Liuan, where he built the Chang'en Retreat, which housed tens of thousands of books. He passed away in the winter of the yiwu year (1895). My two older brothers were both from Jiang Shuren, who passed away earlier. She was the great-granddaughter of Jiang Xinyu, a historiographer from Qianshan, who was also skilled in poetry. My mother was the daughter of Yan Qintang, a licentiate from Lai'an, and the granddaughter of Shen Xiangpei, the wife of Prefect Wu Yinqi. She married my late father as his second wife and gave birth to four daughters. After my late father passed away, evil relatives contested for succession and seized the family property... From this, one can understand Ms. Lü's family background.</p>
<p>There were four Lü sisters: the eldest, Huiru; the second, Meiye (originally named Xianfen, styled Zhongsu, later changed to Meisun, and when living in Qingdao, used the pseudonym Qizhou Female Commoner); the third, Bicheng (styled Duntian, also known as Shengyin); and the fourth, Xianman, styled Kunxiu. Huiru was skilled in ci poetry and also in painting. In the postscript to "Huiru's Short and Long Sentences" attached to Xiaozhu Ci, Bicheng said, "My eldest sister Huiru was deeply knowledgeable in national studies, familiar with hundreds of schools of thought, and had the demeanor of a female scholar. She vowed to remain a widow and presided over maternal education. She spent many years at the Changjiang Ningguo Women's Normal School, and many admired her conduct. At the time of her death, there were family disputes, and her writings were lost. The search for her posthumous manuscripts was listed in the lawsuit, as they were seized along with the inheritance, which is unprecedented for talented women in ancient times..." Huiru's husband was Yan Xiangxian, a marriage between cousins. In Meiye's poem "Returning to the Capital Again," she said, "I, my sister, serve with a towel and comb, an older cousin and brother-in-law," referring to him. Huiru's death was after 1921, because in the winter of 1920, Huiru was still composing ci poetry. Bicheng went to the United States in 1920 and happened to return to China when Huiru died.</p>
<p>Meisun, in her "Visit to Yingzhou Record," described the origins of her journey to the East, saying, "I lost my father at a young age, and from a wealthy family, I changed into an orphaned and poor girl. After the age of twenty, I left my mother and went to Tianjin to serve as a teacher at the Beiyang Women's Public School and concurrently as the chief teacher at the Beiyang Higher Women's School. The following year, I left Yuguan and responded to the invitation of General Zhao Erxun of the Three Eastern Provinces to serve as the dean of studies at the Fengtian Women's Normal School and concurrently as a teacher at the Sino-Japanese co-operated Women's Art School, with the title of honorary principal. It was because General Zhao and my late father, the Educational Commissioner, were classmates in the dingchou year of the imperial examinations, and he cared for the poverty of the family's children and cultivated them generously. It was the late Guangxu era. At that time, one could apply for government funding to study in Europe and the West, but in the end, it was difficult to travel far due to the need to support my elderly mother. After the age of thirty, I again held teaching positions in women's schools in Fujian and Shanghai, and most recently, I was the principal of the Jiangsu Anhui Women's Normal School... Reflecting on my life's travels through eight or nine provinces, north and south to the extreme borders..." This is a chapter from her autobiography. Her published collections of poetry and prose include: "Mianli Yuan Poems" (Complete and Continued Collections), "Yangchun Baixue Ci," and "Yingzhou Visit Poetry Record," etc. Before the Anti-Japanese War, she lived in Qingdao. Her son, Xun De, worked at the Shanghai Bank in Qingdao. In recent years, communication has been cut off, and it is unknown whether she is still in Qingdao.</p>
<h3 id="e144">A Record of Queuing to Buy Surplus Goods <a href="#e144" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c144" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">144</a></h3>
<p>— Mao Yuding</p>
<p>A few days ago, I saw in the newspaper that the Bureau of Materials Supply was selling a large amount of surplus materials in Wing On Department Store, and many citizens were buying them, especially canned food, which was snapped up. I also wanted to buy cheap goods. At eight o'clock that morning, I rushed to Wing On, and I saw dozens of people already waiting in line at the Hubei Road entrance.</p>
<p>Finally, I squeezed into the door of the building. I wanted to breathe a sigh of relief, but I immediately became nervous again: I had to find the cheap things in my mind. I paid attention to the prices of goods in each counter. Except for hardware and Western medicine, which I was not very familiar with, other things like canned food and stationery did not seem to be cheaper than elsewhere, but there were piles of people crowding and buying like crazy. I thought to myself, they are undoubtedly more familiar with the market than I am. I walked around the market twice without buying anything. I thought I couldn't come empty-handed, but I would still go away empty-handed, so I bought two cans of peaches, five jiao each. While I was paying, many men and women crowded around to buy peaches. At first, I didn't understand what this meant, but later I understood that they were a group of true followers. Seeing me buy peaches, they thought the peaches must be cheap.</p>
<p>I didn't linger for long, and I squeezed out with two cans of peaches. My ears were full of buzzing sounds. When I got out of the door, I felt my head was clear, like I had just walked out of a garden full of bees.</p>
<h3 id="e145">Life and Wealth <a href="#e145" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c145" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">145</a></h3>
<p>— Chen Yanfan</p>
<p>Lately, I often think about a problem unintentionally, perhaps related to the things I see and hear around me. A young friend I often met suddenly passed away from a sudden illness. In addition to Mr. Tang, who drowned while swimming in the United States, I lost another friend. Recently, another relative, only in his twenties, had a lung disease and coughed up blood. I hadn't seen him for three days, but he was lying in bed, looking very serious. Apart from Mr. Tang, the friend who died of a sudden illness and the relative mentioned above were both young people who I knew led very unrestrained lives. The former often overate and frequented dance halls and cafes, while the latter was a wealthy young man who married early and indulged in poverty.</p>
<p>Many people feel pessimistic about the fragility and impermanence of life and develop misanthropic thoughts. On a superficial level, they enjoy life, are cynical, and are lazy and颓唐 when things happen. On a deeper level, they are pessimistic, avoid things, and even become mentally ill. Chinese people, both educated and uneducated, often say, "What's the point of living in this world? You never know when you're going to die, so eat and play while you're young and have money." There are lines in ancient poems that say, "Sing when you drink, how long is life?" and "Drink today if you have wine today." It can be seen that there is more than one person who holds the idea of eating, playing, and enjoying life.</p>
<p>Youth and wealth are the most precious things in the world. But young people and those with wealth in the world do not know how to cherish their youth and wealth. We can see in recent newspapers news about the market tigers who were engaged in speculative hoarding in Shanghai being detained. These people, who already possess a large amount of wealth, still desperately accumulate wealth by any means, violating laws and regulations. They are also mostly unwilling to donate anything for relief. This is how the rich in the world are: the more wealth they have, the less they know what to do with it. They would rather hoard it, endangering or imprisoning their descendants and themselves.</p>
<p>Wealth is precious because it has power and can be used to do things that benefit a large group of people. Youth is also precious because it has power and can be used to do things that benefit a large group of people. The world of those who enjoy life, are颓唐, selfish, and self-interested is becoming increasingly small, while those who contribute their lives to things that benefit a large group of people will obtain eternal happiness. It's a pity that young people often waste their youth, and people don't know the power of wealth, so youth and wealth lose their meaning.</p>

<p>There is no land to settle down, the moon on Huazi Hill is alone. The world has changed several times in the East Sea, can waves be as easily moved as mountains?

<p>— Lu Yanshao</p>
<p>The urgent cry of geese passes, the full shadow of the toad descends. The sound of commerce shifts the ancient mansion, the colors of autumn fill the high forest. The city gates are alarmed by the cold, wind and frost head towards the evening anvil. Turning sideways on this day, I still see the depths of the Shu River.</p>
<h3 id="e148">On Crickets <a href="#e148" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c148" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">148</a></h3>
<p>— Ji Yun</p>
<p>As the Mid-Autumn Festival approaches, those who raise crickets take out their stock and gamble against each other, gradually entering a state of excitement. This custom is common in both the north and south, and it is becoming more and more popular. The luxurious leisure class even buys the winning insects in the arena with heavy gold to strengthen their strength and goes out to face opponents everywhere. When they hear that a certain arena is the most popular and has the most gambling, they call friends and gather to conquer from afar, even if it costs a lot of money, they are not stingy. However, in order to seek certain victory, one must carefully select good insects. Therefore, the art of catching insects and selecting them is paramount, and I will describe them separately as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Catching Insects: Catching insects must be done at night. (During the day, one can also catch insects that call for females, but they are very few.) Listen for the sound of insects chirping, look for them and catch them. A good catcher can tell the size of the insect and whether it is good or bad as soon as they hear the chirping. On autumn nights, the chirping of insects can be heard everywhere. If one cannot distinguish the sound, but catches them as soon as one hears them, even if one works hard all night and catches countless insects, they will still be useless. Generally speaking, those that chirp for a long time, are small and constant, rarely have good insects, and the insects are very small, not worth catching. Those that chirp only a few times and then stop, and then chirp a few times after a while, are more likely to be good insects. Those with loud chirping sounds are often larger, or insects with white spots on their heads. Those with solid and clear sounds are mostly good insects. Those that sound like they have a metallic sound are mostly green insects, the strong players of late autumn. Those that make a "pi pi" sound are mostly broad-winged, or oily purple, oily yellow, or oily green insects, who are dominant in early autumn. Those whose chirping is followed by a "ling ling" sound have wings that are slightly different from ordinary insects, and can tremble to make this sound, like cicada wings. There are many good ones among them. At the beginning of the night, or when the sky is about to dawn, when all the insects chirp together, is the best opportunity for catchers. Otherwise, some chirp and some don't, especially after the rain, the chirping is most prevalent. If there is heavy rain followed by a hot sun, then the next few nights will be the best opportunity, because the insects are most productive after being moistened by the rain and baked by the sun. As for the method of catching insects, first you must listen to where the sound comes from in the hole, then gently light a fire and carefully look at it. The head of the insect is often at the entrance of the hole. When you see it, insert a bamboo or iron stick from the side, copy behind it horizontally, and gently pull it to drive the insect out. Do not use too much force, as the insect will jump in surprise and it will be difficult to find. Also, do not use fire to get close to the entrance of the hole, as it will startle the insect and make it escape back into the deep hole, making it impossible to get it out. It is especially taboo to insert a stick into the entrance of the hole, as you will either kill the insect or force it to escape into a horizontal hole, even if you pour water in, you cannot guarantee that it will come out. When the insect is driven out of the hole, if you see a good insect, do not panic, otherwise you will scare the insect away or injure it. You should gently cover it with a cover woven with horsehair or thin copper wire. Once the insect enters the cover, store it in a container and carry it back to raise it in a tile jar. This insect will then be mine.</p>
<p>(2) Selection: There are many insects in early autumn. If you buy and catch them at the same time, it is easy to get hundreds of them a day, but only a few are worth keeping. The selection depends entirely on eyesight. The insects that are caught for the first time are not normal in color and their bodies are mostly constricted. Only an experienced person can tell their merits and demerits. The best color is true green, followed by true yellow and true purple, then light green, light yellow, and light purple, and the worst is male and oily. Because the colder the weather, the fewer insects there are, the more gambling there is. The above-mentioned true-colored insects fight the best in cold weather, especially true green, so it is listed as the top choice. As for the shape of the insect, the first is that the head and teeth must be large, the second is that the neck must be wide, the body must be long, the meat must be fine and solid, and the legs must be long, but if all the shapes are good but the color is dark, it is still not worth keeping, so color discrimination is the most important, and only an experienced person can do it.</p>

<p>— Lin</p>
<p>In our country, emperors were called "Heavenly Sons." The Japanese call their rulers "descendants of gods." All of these are visions of human rulers as celestial beings. Such feudal consciousness is not worth smiling at. This was also the case in Portugal. King Sebastian of Portugal was killed in Morocco in 1578, but the Portuguese all said that their king was actually a celestial being who descended to earth and was bound to be immortal. Therefore, no one believed that he was killed. It has been nine generations since then, but the Portuguese belief has not wavered. Every night, they look up at the sky, hoping to see their former ruler return. There are still many people who do so. People borrow money to sign bonds, stating that "the debt will be paid off after King Sebastian returns."</p>

<h3 id="e152">Ministry of Food Clarifies "Collection of Grain Tax in Kind" <a href="#e152" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c152" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">152</a></h3>
<p>The Ministry of Food replied in a letter: Respectfully acknowledged your letter of August 7. Regarding the inquiries in the letter from Mr. He, a reporter from your newspaper, I will briefly reply as follows: (1) The collection of grain tax in kind is based on the "Wartime Regulations on the Collection of Grain Tax in Kind." The standards for grain tax collection, the collection procedure, the deadline for payment, and the late payment penalty are all specified in the regulations. Now that the suppression of the rebellion continues, it is still applicable. (2) In addition to collecting grain, grain tax in kind also carries a 30% levy for provincial and county public grain, and other surcharges are prohibited. (3) If the provincial and county grain tax management offices deliberately violate laws and regulations and impose surcharges without authorization, they can be reported in accordance with the law. The above three items are replied accordingly for your information and transmission to the Social News Department of the Shen Bao Editorial Department. Ministry of Food, September 1st</p>
