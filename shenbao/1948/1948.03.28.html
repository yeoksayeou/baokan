<h3>國民大會開幕前夕主席發表重要聲明國代當選問題已予解決</h3>
<p>〔中央社南京廿七日電〕蔣主席爲解決國大代表當選問題，廿七日發表聲明如左：　此次國民大會之召築，具有兩重意義，其一爲行使憲法所賦予之職權，完成民選政府之組織。其二爲結束一黨負責之政制，使全國和平合法之政黨循憲法所規定之軌道共負政治責任，導國家於民主憲政與政黨政治之境域。</p>
<p>余爲國民政府主席，在民選政府尙未成立以前，對國家負有責任，余又爲中又國國民黨總裁，對中國國民黨及國民革命完成憲政之目標，亦負有責任，國民政府委會與由國國民黨三中全會及中央常會關於選舉之決議，皆以實現政黨政治，樹立民主憲政規模爲一貫之方針，余對於國民政府與本黨之決議，皆負貫澈之責，亦有執行之權，茲當國民大會開會之前夕，若干表當選資格，因政治與法律觀點之不同，而尙未解決者，余乃負責予以解決。余以爲：本黨同志相互間的問題，應依一般選舉之通例，使得票比較多數者當選，至本黨同志與友黨候選人之問的問題，則應以政治方法爲解決，本黨同志應本於尊重政黨協議與政黨提名之精神，放　其當選資格，俾友黨候補人膺選，惟有如此，始能符合召開國民大會之宗旨。</p>
<p>自國父倡導國民革命迄今五十餘年，在此五十餘年之中，革命先烈與殉國英靈拋頭顱，　熱血，前仆後繼，再接再厲，其目的即在於實行民主憲政。而召開國民大會，成立民選政府，實爲民主憲政之重大關鍵，今日國家局勢至爲嚴重，共匪毒燄如此　張，惟有我全國仁人志士共同維護憲法之尊嚴，確立民主政治之基礎，亦惟有我全國愛國民主黨派共同遵循政黨政治之軌轍，互讓互諒，通力合作，成立憲政政府，遵守憲法，負起保障人民自由，執行基本國策，保持國家領土主權之車責，始能克服艱危，完成戡亂建國之使命。余爲國·爲黨·爲革命歴史與革命權責，茲已將有關之代表當潠證書令選舉總事務所依前述兩項原則分別頒發，須知選舉固爲選民表示意志之方法，而紀律則爲革命黨員所必守，余今日根據黨的協議，依照滅的決策信守黨的諾言，執行黨的紀律，對於本黨同志應否當選代表，能否出席大會之問題，行使黨章所賦予總裁之最後決定權予以決定，此係代表中國國民黨集體之意思，應無悖于選舉法規制定之本旨，爲功爲過，聽諸公論。際此國家實施憲政繫始之時，但求有利於國家，有補於戡亂，有裨於憲政，有助於政黨之合作，則本黨同志應奮發本黨黨員爲革命不惜犧牲一切之傳統精神，對於個人之利益，無不可以犧牲，深望諸同志體念黨的決策，遵守黨的紀律，犧牲小我，顧全大局，協助中正解決此遷延不決之問題，個人雖因退讓而不能參加國民大會，而其對於民主憲政所著之成績，由於忠黨愛國所享之榮譽，必不在出席大會者之下也。</p>

<h3>文武兼備的于右任學生信徒部屬都是他競選的擁護者</h3>
<p>— 于右任</p>
<p>〔本報南京廿七日航訊〕　察院院長于右任先生，誰不知道他是中華民國開國的元老？在新聞界，又誰不知道他是先進？在政府的首長裏，于右老是使新聞界最感到親切的。何况他的現職，正是監督爲政者的言行，努力掃除現政府的汚劣，揭發社會各個　度的不平；與新聞界的職責，殊途回歸。也許，他更走在新聞界的前面，不僅做了新聞界的敢言，還爲了新聞界不能爲的「敢行」！</p>
<p>于右任先生，一張方型的臉，帶着一副異於常人長長的美髯，銀白如絲，飄拂胸前。他是一位慈祥的老人；可是魁偉的身材，蒼勁的聲浪，又說明了他的果斷與前進！</p>
<p>他今年已屆古稀，除去孩提時代而外，可說是廿載寒窗，廿載奔走呼號革命，又廿年爲國民政府効命。在監察院長任內，已經是十八個年頭了。他是文人，但在革命過程中，却曾經做過幾次革命軍總司令。他爲文，紙筆就是刀槍。他爲武，調　軍機，有如奕棋。寓武於文，寓文於武。的是文武兼備。</p>
<p>右老生于陝西，涇水之濱的三原，是他的誕生之地。可是他自廿六歲那年，因爲文譏切時政被當政指爲革命黨，聲稱必將閱緝正法，就離鄉南下到上海，迄今四十餘年，幾視江南爲第二故鄉。</p>
<p>他參加而且領導了國民革命，他更需要看到民主憲政的實現，可是他也認爲沒有什麼必要一定由他來管這些事。他從沒有說過：「我要在新政府裏担任一個重職」！可是，全國各地的他的學生，朋友，早在幾個月前，就已展開擁戴他參加競選副總統的活動。可是他依然很鎭定，他深思熟慮着。記得在本月廿二那天吧，記者去拜望他老人家，滿希望他吿訴我說是他已經決定接受各方擁戴的函電，決參加競選。可是，他沒有。在他那落地長窗的客室裏，他凝視着窗外的草坪，對記者說：「我還在考慮！」我再問：「你還考慮什麼」？他說：「我考慮宣布不宣布的問題」。這是一句幽默的答覆，他撚　而笑。于先生的競選，並不是自己主動，但是最後也並不推却。</p>
<p>記者曾問于先生對於第一屆國民大會的任務是否需要修改憲法，他說：「憲法施行不久，不應該妄提修改，如以立憲原則或精神說，我們似乎還不應該作修改的想法。如果以若干細節來硏討，則尙待事實體驗者正多·何况，修改憲法，只要有必要，隨時可召開臨時國大。這次大會實在只該以選舉爲主要任務」。</p>
<p>〔本報瀋陽廿七日電〕衛立煌決定擁護于右任競選副總統，　渠以傳單及于氏著第二次大戰回憶歌一册送各報，廣事宣傳。</p>
<p>爲于先生競選而　于動的各種助選機構，在全國各地發動組織着，他們大都是于氏學生·信徒·以及部屬。這是一股不小的力量，且等着瞧吧！</p>
<p>李宗仁發表演說競選係於責任感</p>
<p>〔中央社南京廿七日電〕李宗仁將軍廿七日上午十時應政大學生自治會之請，在該校大禮堂發表競選演說，演說後，曾晤見該校教授徐英等多人，交換對時局意見。李氏稱：渠之毅然出而競選副總統，係發於責任感及自信，渠以現代女郎自擬，當成年而且備結婚條件時，即坦率展開覓取理和對象之活動，決不　鄉下姑娘之忸怩怕羞．渠稱：副總統之職位，足以展其生平抱負，亦其理想對象，因渠認爲政治改革宜由中央着手，當選副總統，即可翊贊中樞，完成憲政大業，渠並自信足以輔佐未來之總統，爲其分勞分憂。中國一般民衆，對政治過於淡漠，而潮流所趨，人民必須出而監督，並管理政事，渠爲倡導民主風氣，且激於政治責任感，故有競選之決定。李氏並稱：競選副總統目的，在求多負責任，並非好　榮而出此。李氏於接見政大教授徐英·楊希震。李淸悚等時，曾答復王鏡洁教授之詢問稱：憲法甫經制訂，利弊如何，目前尙難臆斷，故不贊成此次國大對憲法有何修改。李氏今並曾對東北·華北軍政局勢有所報吿。</p>
<p>程潛講戡亂目的改革政治復興經濟</p>
<p>下午二時程潛將軍義應該會之邀，發表競選演說，抒陳渠競選副總統之動機與抱負，程氏發言前後歷一小時許，渠首先重申其一貫主張，認爲副總統係備而不用，不應獨樹一幟，發表政見，惟渠稱：人爲政治動物，對國事應有感想與理想，渠此次演證，即係藉以表達其對國事之感想與理想·程氏指出，今日時局之癥結，在於共匪之武裝叛亂，渠謂：欲達戡亂建國之目的，必須實行下列三事：（一）改革政治，消極的要整飭吏治，剷除貪汚。積極的要實行憲法，樹立國家制度，保障人民自由，保障公教人員之生活。（二）力求經濟之復興，消極的要剷除豪門資本，官僚資本。積極的要復興農工商業，並實行大規模之中外經濟合作，且應倡導勤勞與節約，作復興經濟之基礎。（三）必須貫澈和平外交，使中國勿捲入世界鬥爭之漩渦，以免影響中國之建國。</p>

<h3>完成了歷史使命的國民參政會</h3>
<p>— 雷震</p>
<p>國民參政會基於民國二十七年三月中國國民黨臨時全國代表大會之決議，及其所制定之抗戰建國綱領於同年四月初開始籌備，七月五日召開第一屆第一次大會於漢口，從那時算起，到本年三月底（三月二十八日）結束止，它的歷史恰好整整十年。在這十年當中，三度改選（共分四屆），先後召開大會共十三次。就中第一至第十一次大會係在抗戰時期召開，關於這十一次大會的時代背景及其重要貢獻，本人曾寫過「非常時期的國民參政會」一文，於三十五年一月二日起陸續刋載於上海正言報，嗣經國際出版社譯成英文速同原文印成單行本。至於參政會歷年來組織的演進和職權的擴大，則有夏君道平「七年來的國民參政會」一文，發表於三十四年七月八日重慶中央日報，足供參考。此外國民參政會秘書處現已把各種重要文獻編製成册，不久將可印行，爲硏究現代政治史的人士提供一部完整的資料。所以本人在這篇文字中對於參政會的史實，不擬再加以贅述。</p>
<p>國民參政會對於我國政治的影響如何，當代人士或許見仁見智，彼此評價不同，但在今後歷史家的筆下，國民參政會將佔我國現代政治史中重要之一頁，則無疑義。本人自該會籌備之日起至結束之日止，在秘書處工作十年，十年的時光，在一個人的生活史中，不算一個短的時期，精力的消耗，博得觀感的累積，茲趁該會結束之時，簡述一二，以就教於國人。</p>
<p>本人在「非常時期的國民參政會」一文的結論中，曾經說過：「國民參政會就其組織的原始意義言，爲我國戰時的最高民意機關。」這句話的涵義有二：第一，這個民意機關是屬於戰時的，因而在戰時「軍事第一勝利第一」的大前提下，國民參政會自當以「集思廣益，團結全國力量」爲基本任務。第二，這個組織只是一個「民意」機關，不是憲政時期行使「民權』的機構，因而在法律上講，政府並不對之負政治責任。這一點，我個人覺得，是論及國民參政會時所應該首先認識淸白的。有了這個認識，我們才不致於把它看做英國的Parliament或美國Congresse，因而對於它才不致青望太　’面對其歷年的貢獻，亦會予以適當的評價。</p>
<p>我們知道，從民國元年到十五年，在名義上我國也是一個民主國家，有國會也有過幾部憲法。但在實際政治上，從未表現過民意。當時的政黨除國民黨——中華革命黨——中國國民黨以外，都沒有理論的基礎，也沒有確定的政策，政客們朝秦暮楚，只便宜了軍閥們的割據。這種局面，到了國民政府統一全國，才算吿一結束。照着中國國民黨建國的程序，本來是由軍政時期，經過訓政而達到憲政的。但在政府厲行訓政的時候，國內共黨叛亂，國外日本侵略，使政府的訓政工作未能順利完成，而九一八事變忽焉爆發。在這個時期，國內的政治形勢並不單純，因爲九一八事件發生以後，政府在知己知彼的打算下，雖有抗敵的決心和積極進備的事實，但不能昭吿於國人，同時對於日本反不得不委屈周旋，以爭取時間加强抗戰準備。這種苦心，爲當時其他政治黨派所不諒解。西安事變正是這種形勢被共黨利用而釀成的。直到日本發動了蘆溝橋事變，全面抗戰之局揭開，政府歷年的苦心和實際準備，始可全盤託出而見諒於國人。國民參政會也就在這個時候組織起來。國民參政會包括了全國各黨各派及無黨無派的社會碩彥，這樣形成了一個全國政治力量的大團結。在八年抗戰期間，因爲共黨的別具用心，軍事和政治方面雖不免時有糾紛，但國民參政會始終是在抗戰的大謹下，表現團結的精神。即共黨有時不出席會議以圖要挾，但終不敢斷然宣吿退出。抗戰後期，政府與共黨的歷次商談，和三十五年初的政治協商會議，國民參政會都從旁促成。儘管這些商談和協商的結果，現在已被破壞無餘，但從一個歷史家的眼光看來，當時參政會所表現的這種政治作風——加强團結的作風，遠非民初的所謂民主政治所可望其項背。</p>
<p>政治上的團結，是抗戰必勝的先決條件，參政會在這方面確已完成了它的使命。再就與抗戰直接有關的方面來看，二十七年底日相近衛發表誘和聲明，接着汪逆精衛離渝赴港，發表艷電，那時正是日本政治攻勢　於高潮的時期。而汪逆精衛當時爲國民參政會的議長，他之出走附敵，如照常理推測，對於他所領導的團體或不無分化的影響，可是事實上國民參政會不僅不因一個議長的叛變而稍呈分化之象，而且於二十八年春召開大會時，表現了全民的決意，通過了「擁護蔣委員長駁斥近街聲明的宣言。」至此，敵人的政治陰謀，遭受到最後一次有力的打擊。嗣後無論戰局如何艱險，亦無所謂和戰問題發生，使全國軍民集中力量爭取最後勝利，至敵人投降而後已。從這一點看來，較之民初袁氏竊位時國會議員的分化，和護法時期南北國會之對立，國民參政會確實做到了反映全民意志，不愧爲一個最高民意機關。</p>
<p>我們僅就上述這兩點來說，國民參政會已經爲我國民主政治做了一個很好的開端，已經完成了歷史的使命。至於行政改革的建議和督促，抗戰根據地川康建設的促進，以及經濟動員和經濟建設的策進，憲政工作的準備和推行，以及國民外交的運用等等，俱有文獻足徵，這裘不必一一分述。</p>
<p>此外，基於我個人的觀感，覺得有一個關於初期民治的問題，也可在此提出商榷。依據國民參政會組織條例，參政員之產生，大別之有兩種方式：一爲地方民意機關選舉，一爲中央政府選定。由這兩種方式而產生的參政員，因組織條例的幾度修改，其名額比率，前者遞增，後者遞减。換言之，由地方選舉的參政員在前一兩届總名額中所佔的比率，比在後一兩届所佔的比率小，也就是說，中央選定的參政員在前一兩届總名額中所佔的比率，比在後一兩届所佔的比率大。這種演變，也可說是參政會的民主色彩日漸濃厚，但進一步分析，後一兩届參政會所表現的成績，似反不及前一兩屆彩。我們只要一檢閱歷届大會的提案和質詢，即可看出一個蕪雜而寡要的趨勢。在這種趨勢下，精力時間乃至紙張文具的浪費，尤其餘事，對於實際政治和政治作風之不良影響，實不容忽視。這個現象如果說是初期民治不可避免且不應避免的弊端，如英美人所說的Necessary　evil的話，則吾人可不置論，如有改善之必要和改善之可能，則吾人對於今後民意機關代表產生之方式，似可不必徒唱高調，而須就實際的國情，加以周詳的考慮。現在我國憲法上規定的各種選舉方法，除特別者外，均以普通平等直接及無記名投票之方法行之（憲法一二九條）這本是最民主的方式，可是我們也得知道，這種最民主的選舉方式，即在憲政之每的英國，也是經過了幾百年的歷程直到一九一八年才採用的。我國這次國代及立委選舉之實際，其眞能按照應法上規定的方法運用者，究有幾何？這是値得我們深切反省的。</p>
<p>再就提案方面來說，也是有値得今後各級民意機關注意和改善之處的。前面我已經提過，參政會在後一兩屆當中，提案和質詢有一種蕪雜而寡要的趨勢。這種現象，固可證明來自各地之參政員均係關心民瘼和國事，各就所聞所見踴躍提案，熱烈發言，無論在政治軍事或外交經濟方面，均右許多提案，甚至一人有十件以上之提案者。提案多，會期短，於是在審查會中草草審查，在大會中又草草通過，其結果，矛盾衝突，比比皆是。這樣不僅使政府執行議案時感到左右爲難，同時亦表現參政會的立塲未能整齊一致。據聞美國國會每年收到議員的提案亦有多至二千件以上的時候，但通過於國會交政府執行的，經常不過幾十件。因審查會權力相當大，對於議員之提案均予以嚴審查，凡不妥適的，則毫不客氣的予以打銷。而我們的民意機關，每每顧及情面，對於他人之提案，縱不贊成，亦不願正面反對，結果則多修正通過。參政會的決議案，對於政府本爲建議性質，無硬性拘束力，其內容雖嫌蕪雜或矛盾，尙不太關緊要，但今後立法院通渦之議案，除在某種條件之下政府是必需執行的，如果在立法院中仍承製參政會的風習（這種風習非自參政會始，國民黨的代表大會及中央全會以及各省市的縣參議會，均有此種作風），則對於民主政治的推行，妨碍甚大·這一點是我們應該特別注意的·（卅七，三，廿八，國民參政會結束之日）。</p>

<h3>京高院判決選舉官司被告谷正綱張厲生均出庭一審終結原告訴訟被駁回</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿七日電〕苜都高院廿七日遭受行憲後首次攷驗，運用程序規定，駁回簽署提名當選國大代表對政黨提名代表及選舉事務機關負責官吏之控訴，確定司法機　對政黨互讓原則問題之不觸及態度。晨九時審判長民一庭庭長鄭禮鍔偕推事蕭素彬，楊雨田升庭，旋傳原吿邱映光，傅曉峯，律師藍在杭，趙鉌，第二被吿全國性職婦團體選舉事務所代理人谷正綱，及選舉總事務所代理人張厲生等出庭應訊，第一被吿　實平，韋瓊瑩則未出庭·</p>
<p>起訴根據</p>
<p>首由原吿律師葉在聲稱，原高係根據團代選舉罷免法第三十九條之後半，確認當選人所得票數不實，及本人所得票數被計算錯誤，聲請　吿　吿當選無效，並負担所有訴訟費用，由原告具領當選證書，出席國大·繼由谷正綱，張厲生兩氏聲稱放葉駁回之請求，願庭上依法處理。庭上乃依次詢問原被吿，邱映光稱渠得六七四二票，被告李實平（靑年黨）僅得千餘票，而職婦團體選所公布名單中，渠竟以「原已當選政黨互讓」之註語，退居候補。傅曉峯稱渠得五〇四一票，被吿韋瓊瑩（民社黨）僅得一五二票，退讓並未徵得渠同意。兩人均强調當選力受選民付託，政黨或個人均不能私相授受。庭上則注重票數是否不實，及計算有誤兩點。</p>
<p>谷張意見</p>
<p>谷正綱則亦聲明稱票數決無錯誤，以票多者公布爲候補者之原因，於三月六日公布名單之公告中業已說明：全國性職婦團體選所原已將各項選舉結果統計完竣，並已依法決定當選人及候補人次序，後准選總所選字一七七〇號代電開來業經國府備案之黨讓黨名單，囑遵照併辦迅發證書，故遵令改列公佈。張厲生則指出黨讓黨乃國民黨與他黨協議決定之原則，國民黨以函及名單送達選總所後，總所自不能接受政黨意見，經呈奉國府指令准備案後，始予照辦。渠稱恐原吿爲國民黨黨員，若然，其黨派自可加以拘束。</p>
<p>辯論四點</p>
<p>至此，邱映光復聲明以前爲國民黨黨員，此次未重行登記，已無黨員身份。傅曉峯亦聲明曾爲三民生義靑年團團員，然黨團合併後未入黨，無黨員身份。　在杭律師乃起立爲原吿辯論四點：（一）選所公吿當選人名單　有法令根據，政黨互讓於法無據，不能以政黨協議觸憲毁法。（二）被吿執行明知違法之命令，應負行政責任，不能推諉。（三）人民依法平等，原吿即使退讓，亦須自動同意。（四）原吿非黨員，應不受約束。渠認票數之無不實或計算無誤乃內部原因，自外視之，如票數無問題，即以其他原因妨害民權，實無理由，故根據國代選舉罷免法第三十九條，提起訴訟。趙銖律師則根據憲法第一三九條候選人應一律公開競選之規定，及國代選舉罷免法第二十八條應以票多者當選之規定，呼籲法院愛護民主憲政，維持國家正義。原吿傅曉峯復表示願於行憲伊始見政府守法，法律公正，法院負責。被吿谷正綱則堅稱票數絕對無誤，原吿是否黨員須問國民黨，渠本人決不推諉責任，完全依法服務，渠認政黨互讓是政治需要。張厲生則重申請庭上依法辦理，渠個人爲國家官吏，決守法盡職，願以身作則。</p>
<p>駁囘理由</p>
<p>至此審判長宣告辯論終結，法官會議後，至十時當庭宣判：「原告訴訟駁回，訴訟費用由原吿負担。」審判長並解釋判決理由爲原吿訴訟無法律根據，蓋依國代選舉罷免法第三十九條，可爲訴訟根據者僅三點（一）當選人資格不合；（二）當選人所得票數不實；（三）本人所得票數計算錯誤，此案並無相符之處，故予駁回·此一相當發動之選舉糾紛案，於此結束。</p>

<h3>企圖在競選期內施搗亂　義共組織突擊隊　史福薩接見美大使長談</h3>
<p>〔合衆社羅馬廿六日電〕據義政府方而消息：義大利共產黨領袖，在失去民衆擁護　到驚慌以後，業已命令全國黨員，不擇一切手段，包括必要時之武力手段在內，以　採取更堅決之行動。政府方面又稱，共黨業已在米蘭附近成立「突擊隊」總部，祗等待羅馬共黨之特別命令，即將一在選舉運動中採取攻勢。又傳共黨在義北部各地，組織「行動隊一此項組織之當前任務係進　反動黨政治團體。由於此項及其他情勢發展之結果，消息靈通界方面稱，義副總理巴錫亞蒂將於下週初召開內閣中之公安委員會會議，硏究在全國採取安全措施。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社羅馬廿七日電〕美駐義大使鄧廿七日與義外長史福薩會商最近之國際政治發展，達一小時以上。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社廿七日羅馬電〕義國民議會議員無錫佛羅廿七日提出建議稱，義政府中不應再有共黨，渠呼籲一切民主政黨在選舉前發表正式宣言，不再與共黨合作，無錫佛羅稱，渠將正式發表此項宣言。</p>
<p>〔聯和社羅馬廿六日電〕加斯貝利總理今日宣稱：義大利各地雖有零星亂事，但仍將按預定日期舉行普選。共黨散播謠諑謂各地發生之小規模罷工與衝突，或將遣使四月十八日國會選舉展期，加氏此言即其答復。同時米蘭大廣場四日來因共黨互相示威，幾成　聲場所。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社羅馬廿六日電〕選舉日期日益逼近，此間各黨派之競選運動亦隨之而日趨白熱化。茲將各黨派之情形綜述如下：今日各黨派之競選目標，莫不以特里埃斯特爲題目，　港必須交還義大利，此爲確切不移之事，各黨派對於此點均一致同意。但關於如何實現此一目的之實際執行方法，則議論紛紜，頗多分歧。現分成二大派，一派歡迎法英美三强之建議，認爲唯有參加簽訂和約之西方三强始能解決此一問題。另一派則爲共黨與社會黨聯合組織之「民主陣綫」，彼等認爲三強關於特港之決定，僅屬「競選把戲」，甚至爲一挑撥行爲，唯有與南斯拉夫謀致直接協定，始能解決保障亞得利亞海之和平問題。三强特港決議在義大利各城市引起衝突事件，最甚者僅有米蘭一處，米蘭之情形頗爲緊張，警察戒備森嚴。截至日前爲止，尙無重大事件發生。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社羅馬二十六日電〕義大利共黨領袖陶格里雅蒂今晨在「團結報」中撰文稱，西歐列强關於特港之決定，僅係美國之欺騙，欲使義大利墮入西方集團之羅綱，而在另一次大戰中塡塞砲眼。四月十八日選舉結束後，甘心爲外國帝國主義服役之奴僕將盡被逐出於政府之外，届時當能於四十八小時內解決特港問題，並使各方面均感滿意。</p>
<h3>南斯拉夫對特港問題　願與義友好解決　狄托對義左翼份子表示</h3>
<p>〔路透社貝爾格勒廿六日電〕南斯拉夫總理狄托元帥頃發表衆所期待關於特港問題之意見，認爲英美法之建議使特里雅斯特歸還義國，係爲義國之選舉而採取的手段，意在防止義國民主份子結成堅固陣綫，以保護其自由，並使民主份子不能將未邀而赴義國之人逐出義國。狄托係向赴伊斯特里亞參加復活節慶祝畢又來南國遊歷之義大利文化工作者及農工工人代表多人致辭。狄托請彼等轉吿義大利人民，南斯拉夫始終願以友好方法解決義南兩國間足以阻止兩國和平及正常發展及有損兩國人民友誼合作的一切問題。</p>
<p>狄托復吿彼等：「余盼望諸君來貝爾格勒後，已可發現義大利與南斯拉夫人民原係友人而非敵人。新南斯拉夫業已證明願與一切鄰邦，包括偉大的義大利人民修好。在目前局勢下，需要由各民主份子團結一致，向戰爭販子所發動，以離間國內民族及國際關係的宣傳作戰。諸君此次來南，可知所謂南國陳兵邊界，準備開入特港，以及所謂南國在邊界設有火箭彈發射基地，準備向義施放等等惡意報吿之價値，此不過爲一種選舉前夕的手段，以煽動義人對南之仇恨。在選舉時欺騙義人民陣綫而已。偉大的義大和人民　即醒悟，揭穿此等技倆，拒絕未曾被邀而赴義國者之奸計。</p>
<h3>蘇聯對特港建議　未表明態度</h3>
<p>〔路透社倫敦廿七日電〕英外交部發言人透露，蘇聯外交部已覆牒英美法政府，承認業已接獲三强關於特港之建議，但未說明蘇政府對此一建議之態度。據消息靈通方面稱，在義大利舉行普選前，蘇聯當避不表明對此事之能度。</p>
<h3>特港義人擬請求　英美軍繼續留駐</h3>
<p>〔中央社特里埃斯特廿六日電〕義大利人已展開運動即　蘇聯同意西方盟國，將特港　還義大利之建議，並希望特港美英軍隊無限期留駐。義人認爲現在特港之兩萬美英軍隊之繼續留駐，對於防止南斯拉夫人可能發動之暴動，較之數師著綠色制服裝備惡劣之義軍爲佳。此項運動　見於「自由之聲」報上，義人自特港盟國佔領軍總司令英國艾雷少將之公開信中，義人似覺相信義軍若應召保衛特港時，將表現良好之戰鬥精神，但認爲美英軍隊之留駐，當屬更佳。盟國人士表示同情義國之立塲，但若特港果歸還義國，英美是否將應允其繼續駐軍特港之請求，則表懷疑。</p>

<h3>美對西政策改變</h3>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓廿七日電〕美國要求西班牙元首弗朗哥大選改革內政之壓力，已稍减輕，蓋恐此項改革將有助於西班牙之共產黨也。美國　擬要求西班牙作表面子之改革，以便西班牙得藉此參加馬歇爾計劃，而美國及西歐國家亦可不失面子。但即此微小之要求，亦已遭弗朗哥之拒。美國對西政策之改變，醞釀已有數月，國會議員一人本週初且曾爲弗朗哥辯護，稱弗朗哥反共已歷有年所，又稱渠之目的旣與馬歇爾計劃之目的吻合，應准　其列入參加之例。</p>

<h3>美英答覆蘇抗議　反責蘇破壞波茨坦協定　德東西分裂應由蘇負責</h3>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓廿六日電〕美國昨向蘇聯提出照會，對其抗議美英法三國月前倫敦會議討論西德經濟合併係屬破壞波茨坦協定一節加以拒絕，並譴責蘇聯在德國東部重新設立集中營，拘禁反對專制之人士。同時，英國政府亦於昨日向蘇聯提出同樣之照會</p>
<p>美方照會係田副國務卿亞摩爾署名，送交蘇聯大使潘友新，今夜由國務部予以公布，內稱德國與歐洲分裂爲東西兩部，此事應由蘇聯及其東歐附庸國負責。查一九四六年九月美國務卿貝爾納斯即已正式給予蘇聯以參加德境佔領區經濟合併之機會，蘇聯不應接受，應自食其後果。蘇聯在德國東部强迫社會黨與共黨合併，此一新黨已成爲東德專制政府之新壁壘，其他政黨亦受壓制歧視與恫嚇，以致不能自由行使職務。</p>

<p>〔聯合社漢城廿七日電〕美佔領軍官今日　　，朝鮮南部　對五　普選之右派各黨領袖如果同意，自可前赴北部參加四月十四日蘇聯召集之會議，蓋藉此獲悉蘇聯對於朝鮮國內問題之處置辦法，或者不無益處。但平　蘇軍當局邀請韓南政治領袖赴會一舉恐係試探能自南部取得何種實力之輕氣球，或係企圖破壞聯合國機構計劃，徒足增加局勢混亂，此點必須注意。</p>

<p>至於選舉之后商業的趨向如何，却難斷言，但是兩黨中究竟那一黨獲勝，對　商業的未來趨向，似乎稍爲有一些關係。杜魯門的競選前途和今後幾個月中的商業狀况，是互相密切聯繫的。</p>
<p>一九四八年爲總統競選年這一事實，並不是說今年的商業一定會不景氣。景氣或不景氣的機會是均等的。但是假如目前這種向下的商業趨向繼續下去，直到十一月份的話，那麼杜魯門總統大致要在競選中失敗。</p>
<p>總統的職位從一黨轉換到另一黨手中的情形，大致發生於商業不景氣之年。在商業景氣的年份，這種轉換就難得發生。在商業不景氣的情形之下，祗有一個富有治力或者畸形的環境，可以防止執政的政黨在競選中落選。</p>
<p>根據一八六四年以來二十一次總統競選所作的分析，一般人對於競選和商業之間的關係，有一些類似的看法。大家認爲競選對於商業的影響較少，商業對於競選的影響較大。</p>
<p>自從一八六四年以來的二十一次總統競選中，白宮主人從一黨轉換到另一黨者凡七次。在這七次轉換中，到有六次發生於商業趨向下游的情形之下。商業情形好而執政政黨被推倒的情形祗有一次，那就是一九一二年。那一年，T·羅斯福脫離共和黨，以第三黨地位競選，結果民主黨的威爾遜獲勝。他祗不過得到較多數的選票而非大多數選票。</p>
<p>一個執政政黨能在商業情形趨向下游之時繼續佔有白宮的，祗有三次。但是這種趨向下游的情形，並不是那種引起失業的深刻的不景氣。</p>
<p>在這廿一次選舉中，九次之後商業走勢向上，十次之後向下，還有兩次無大變化。這表示政黨的政策及一般狀况決定商業的趨向，而非選舉的結果決定的。但是選舉的結果對於選舉後的商業趨勢，似乎不無影響。一般地說，商業趨勢在共和黨獲勝之後，比民主黨獲勝之後往往好些。</p>
<p>假如純粹根據商業和選舉來預料一九四八年競選的結果，我們可以說從目前到十一月間的商業趨向具有決定的作用。</p>
<p>已往的紀錄顯示：假如商業上發生不良的變化，那麼結果共和黨幾乎一定可以獲勝。商業稍稍趨向下游也可能產生同樣的結果。但是假如在一九四八年今後幾個月份中商業能趨穩定，或者有向上的掬勢，杜魯門先生獲勝的機會可以好得多。總統勝利的可能性是和商業的趨勢成比例的。</p>
<p>這是依照選舉的正常中情形所作的推測。但是杜魯門先生目下在左右兩派圍攻之下，其地位或許比上面所說的更危險些。（譯自「世界報吿」週刋）</p>

<h3>一艘駛入國門的修理艦　「興安號」羅曼斯</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿六日訊〕第一個鏡頭：中華民國三十七年三月二十二日，海軍代總司令桂永淸將軍在南京下關一艘軍艦的士兵飯廳里舉行記者招待會，室周懸着禮旗，他左邊坐的是艦長徐時輔中校，鏡頭移出艙面，從船頭掃到船尾，這是「興安號」修理艦。</p>
<p>第二個鏡頭：中華民國三十六年十二月八日，外交部長王世杰博士與司徒雷登大使在外交部客廳中簽字在中美海軍協定上。根據這個協定，美國爲助我建立海軍，將護航驅逐艦級以下的剩餘船艦二百七十一艘讓贈中國，其中有修理船兩艘，一艘是一萬五千噸的「峨嵋號」，一艘便是「興安號」。</p>
<p>第三個鏡頭：中華民國三十六年六月二十八日，徐時輔艦長率領九十八名官兵，抵達美國南部墨西哥灣沿岸的新奧爾良港（ＮewOrleans），他們面對着「興安號」的前身，「阿其爾斯（Achilles）號」，一條旣不能響又不會動的死船，一個小兵的失望的面孔，失望的聲音：</p>
<p>「我們大遠從祖國跑到這裏要接受的就是這條船？我們難過得都要哭了。」</p>
<p>這是贈予也是友情</p>
<p>但是，這是贈予，這是友情，尤其重要的，即便是這破傢伙我們中國還沒有，而這又正是祖國需要的。中國新海軍的建設是艱難的，克服艱難才有成功，徐艦長說：</p>
<p>「我們的任務是接艦，無論如何得把這條船開回國門。」在酷熱的天氣裏，這九十九員官兵流着汗頂着太陽，在炙燙的甲板上，在悶燠的油艙底，辛勤的展開整舊布新的工作，一直到年底。</p>
<p>「興安號」前身是美國海軍第四五五號戰車登陸艦，一九四三年一月十日編隊開始服役，五月二日駛抵澳洲雪梨，改裝爲修理艦，六月二日在新幾內亞的米倫（Milne）開始執行任務，九月參加新幾內亞的布納（Buna）登陸戰役，被日機炸中船尾部的士兵艙，水底推進器也遭摧毀。一九四四年八月命名「阿其爾斯號」，編爲登陸修理艦第四十一號，十月參加菲律賓雷伊泰島（Leyte）登陸戰役，被一架日人自殺飛機掩在船頭上，修理班全部陣亡，甲板穿了個大洞。一九四五年六月十日參加婆羅洲的首邑婆羅乃（Brunei）登陸戰役，日本投降後返美泊新奧爾良港，一九四六年元月「退役」。</p>
<p>表面退役　實際報廢</p>
<p>這里的〔退役」，實際上是「報廢」。登陸艇的設計原祗爲短期用途，各部分的修造都極粗陋。「阿其爾斯號」經改裝爲修理艦後，雖增加了修械部門的設備，但船殼和骨架等基本設備是無從改造的，所以經過兩度在登陸戰役中遭受重創，這原本第四五五號戰車登陸艦，比起去年已在靑島接受的艦齡較輕的同級戰車登陸艦（如中海·中權等編號全在一千上下），可以說是破敗不堪了。在中國政府不曾委託美國政府招商代修以前，「阿其爾斯號」創痕未復，甲板上扭曲變形積銹成層，艙底里防水區劃全毀，彈藥倉裝備蕩然，淡水艙里也侵灌了柴油。「退伍」後的「　其爾斯號」如果不是有一整套　械設備，應該與廢鐵無異，得天獨厚的美國海軍當然要把它「報廢」</p>
<p>四萬美元　招商承修</p>
<p>中國接艦官兵到新奧爾良港後看到的「阿其爾斯號」，還是業經美國政府代爲招商承修我們花了四萬元美金以後的樣子，但是那批工資拿到十四元一天的工人和經手承修的包商並不曾盡心使船的情况有足够改善，因爲在美國人心目中認爲在「廢鐵」上花工夫是白費氣力。四萬元換來的是甲板厚銹上而平加一層髹漆，艙底防水區劃修好，損壞過甚的右主機部分換修，但是死船還是死船，仍是旣不能响也不會動。</p>
<p>長期廢置不用的船艦和長期廢置的房屋一樣，「阿其爾斯號」上水電俱無，重塵暗封，等待着接艦的官員要想住進去還得一番修理掃除。第一步是恢復電力設備，艦上共有三部發電機，沒有一部能用的，第一部修好兩天便又燒壞，只得先修好另一部馬力小些的應用發電，慢慢的修理照明綫路，把黑暗從艙里驅逐出去好進行其他工作。艦上有了燈，第二步便是解決飲水問題，淡水艙里油汚不堪，爲了使它變得淸潔可用，士兵們要從小洞里爬進去工作，北回歸綫上的夏天，艙底猶如蒸籠，人在里面挨着　熱和氣悶，差不多過十分鐘就要暈倒一個，淡水艙是這樣淸掃而又髹漆後方可使用的。然後寢室，飯廳逐步修好，解決了上船過日子的問題。</p>
<p>可是，在引擎還不能工作的時候，「阿其爾斯號」仍是不能行動的。它左右一共兩個主機，全沒有過去歷史的紀錄，但它們磨損的情况告訴人，它們都已超出了應換修的時限。承修的包商祗把已不能動彈的右主機換修了一部分必須換修的零件，左主機在初一試車時便吿損壞，需要重修。引擎是一條船行駛所賴，「阿其爾斯號」僅有六十餘筋艦身不能算是十分堅强，本身修械配備又較重，要使它平安的漂洋越海回到祖國，越發不能疏忽引擎的效能，於是這部最重要的修理工作一直到半年後它駛離珍珠港才算結束。</p>
<p>整理之后　重加設備</p>
<p>除了艙底設備和動力機部分的修理以外，再有便是各種整理工作。所有各部分的積銹和花錢買來的浮面的髹漆要重新敲掉，重新髹漆幾遍；每一架床，每一把椅，每一張檯案都得重新添配；醫務室器材需要大量補充；修械配備材料要大事整理購置。至於艦上的防衛設備，在「阿其爾斯號」被決定「退伍」時已拆的光光的，原來配有的十二挺四十糧口徑高射機槍祗剩了一個，砲座的圓圈，另外十二挺二十糎口徑高射機槍也祗在甲板上找到一些裝設的舊痕，還有四尊半吋口徑的小砲也沒了踪影，兩個彈藥倉石棉設備蕩然無存。經過了交涉和修理，彈藥倉修復了，零件配齊了，武器却祗裝配了原有的一半不到，四十糎口徑高射機槍被拒絕裝配，十二挺二十糎口徑高射機槍因爲砲位關係也祗裝起了六挺，半吋口徑小砲裝起了兩尊，總一算有了防衛設備。</p>
<p>「阿其爾斯號」是修理艦，但它本身還得如此的大費修理，這從美國人眼里看來是不可思議的愚蠢，但過了四個月多這艘經過修理的修理艦畢竟活轉來了。十一月五日接艦官兵正式把它從承修包商和美國海軍部手里接收過來，命名呌「興安號」，十一月七日它駛動了，在萬人驚奇的目光下，這艘曾被視作廢鐵而「報廢」了的美國船，飄揚着中國海軍美麗的旗幟，吼呌一聲便離開新集　良港，駛向祖國。</p>
<p>興安號的修復工作是艱難的，北回歸綫上辛苦的四個月對接艦的九十九個官兵是個嚴重的考驗，這種記憶宛如一塲噩夢。徐艦長不大願意提起那些困阻，尤其是那些人爲的困阻，但他不會忘記他們的辛勞，在記者招待會里舉出了修淡水艙的例子，在官艙里他指着牆板說：</p>
<p>「瞧！就這樣，我們把它又漆了五遍。」</p>

<h3>西南大動脈　湘桂黔鐡路　都築段工程踏勘記　（下）</h3>
<p>鄰近之邦水一號二號隧道，導坑共長三一三公尺，先後於去年四月十二日鑿通，因石質堅硬，防護校易，所有擴大與落底工作，進行較速。惟邦水至大栗樹間萬山叢纍，此起彼伏，鐵路綫所過地方，時而穿山，時而越谷，雖僅五公里半，工程至爲繁難，計有大小隧道八個，大小橋五個，而土方構築，由於過去民工辦理不善，當地縣府尙未協助興築，據云此於特工進行，尙無大關礙。</p>
<p>一時三十分，吉普在山腰間運料便道行進，二時許抵達大栗樹大橋，該橋跨於麻江貴定兩縣界之大栗樹河下游，鐵路由河對岸緩緩行進至大栗樹大橋渡河後再緩緩延伸而至大栗樹車站，成一道地之電燈泡大彎曲綫，大栗樹車站因施工員司無地住宿，已提前於去年冬全部洛成，記者等即爲該車站之第一批旅客，在該地享用午餐，橋工地點距車站約兩公里，橋長二四六公尺，九孔十一墩，最高橋墩達三十五公尺，徑空二十公尺，橋基有深至十一公尺至六七公尺不等，爲鋼筋混凝土大拱橋，居都筑段</p>
<p>橋工首位</p>
<p>且爲華南鐵路唯一大拱橋。刻橋基已全部下好，正進行橋墩砌工，有工人百餘，於五公里外之　山中　運料石，包商爲工程工廠界後起之秀聯合工程工廠承造，特在半山間開築運石滑糟三〇〇公尺，利用輕便鐵道之鋼軌平面傾斜築成，藉以節省工程，此爲都筑段各隧道橋工唯一僅有之滑稽。大栗樹河因位居　山之間，有山洪起落，工程常受阻礙，該廠特備有抽水機四部，專任排水工作　橋工進行，乃吿順利，興工以來，已逾十四月，以現値計算，全部工程費約近三百億元，僅完成橋工百分之二十左右，如經費不能按時接濟，工程勢將停頓，此橋關係全段工程極大，有關各方，深爲憂慮。</p>
<p>是日下午五時，記者團一行，離大栗樹折返運料便道至黔桂公路九十八公里地方向馬塲坪繼續南行，因吉普發生故障，當晚深夜十時許，抵達馬塲坪住宿。</p>
<p>十三日上午八時，離馬場坪，於十時三十分抵達距都勻十公里之馬坡，一總段總段長徐學茂隧工所主任姚應尊，三總段石板河大橋橋工所主任趙家樑及工程師多人，先一日齊集馬坡隧工所迎接，盛情至感。隧工所佃居桃紅李白，落英繽紛之農村中，整潔淸爽，春意滿眼，一行稍事休憇，即用午餐，旋由徐總段長陪引參觀僑頭舖，馬坡兩大橋及馬坡一·二·三號隧道，此段施工範圍，均屬第一總段，全部工程進行頗速，全段計四十五公里，內包括道十個，長一千餘公尺，大橋七個，長六〇四公尺，已發包承造工廠者計百分之二十五。他如小橋涵洞，長十公里許，於三十五年年底興工，刻已大體完竣。</p>
<h3>錫建華小學被搗毀　校具書籍打成雪片</h3>
<p>〔本報無錫廿六日訊〕本邑大牆門鎭第三十二保保長陸博序等，於去冬集資發起創辦建華小學一所，以該保附近之興靈菴爲校舍，共有學生六十餘名，聘請範振民爲校長，本月廿四日下午二時，范正在上課時期，突有鄰校校董鄒福泰，串同地痞鄒福保，陸水金等二三十人，手特香牌，藉名來菴燒香，衝入校內，脅迫校長范振民，迅將以前搬走之「華陀師」及「路頭」等神像，搬回原處，該校長見來勢兇猛，祗得乘機兔脫，暴徒一聲喝打。教具與書籍齊飛，打成雪片，並將國旗及國父遺像撕擲於地，旋即一哄而散。此事發生後，該校全體學生及家長，於廿五日來城赴縣政府請願，要求拘捕暴動人犯，到案法辦。</p>
<p>馬坡附近</p>
<p>淸泰坡爲都筑段起點，至文德塲約十公里，因馬坡與文德塲均盛產煤礦，爲供應都勻以南，業經復軌通車之火車用煤，故一總段之施工重點，着重此十公里以內之一切隧道橋工，就此段工程而言，刻已完成百分之八十以上，如經費與材料許可，兩月之後，即可舖軌通軍。</p>
<p>記者等在馬坡首先參觀僑頭舖大橋，該橋長一四五公尺，七墩五孔，徑空十公尺，爲鋼筋混凝土丁字樑，橋基橋墩均已完成，尙待努力者不渦百分之四十而已，承造商爲承造東北華北許多大鐵路工程而極富盛名之餘慶工程廠，工地經理董某特爲記者展覽所包各項工程之大小模型，俾窺全豹。繼參觀馬坡橋，橋長七十四公尺，五墩三孔，徑空十公尺，同爲鋼筋混凝土丁字樑，亦同爲鐵路與公路交岔而行之大橋，刻已完工百分之七十。繼至馬坡一號隧道參觀，該隧道長九十公尺，導坑已全部鑿通，工人百餘，正努力落底中，惜東頭石質惡劣，常有崩塌現象，刻正利用絞迎起重機起運料石，另捲石拱襯砌，將來工程可保無虞，鄰近之馬坡二號隧道，導坑長一五〇公尺，　通尤早，惟地質複雜情形與一號相近，亦常有崩塌現象，刻正一面淸理，一面加添石拱，藉資防護。馬坡三號隧道，爲記者等此次參觀都筑段工程之最後處所，該隧道長九十公尺，以石質堅硬，開工較早，經已全部完竣，一切擴大落底工作，兩旁排水溝渠及避人洞等，均已整潔可觀，兩端築有禦土牆三十公尺，工堅料實，愧然成章，爲附近水色山光增添風景不少。</p>
<p>參觀畢後，時已薄暮，遂驅車入都勻，下榻一總段辦公處，晚餐後，</p>
<p>游都勻市及火車站，市面繁榮，街道整潔，臨近火車站之長堤，雖値深夜而燈火不滅，旅客雜，固可十足證明凡通火車地方其工商經濟自屬特別報達。由都勻至獨山，南丹，每週星期一三五日均有混合列車一列開出，約計十四小時即可抵達南丹北站。每週星期二四六日由南丹開車北上都勻，此段客貨運至爲頻繁，蓋亦黔南富裕所在及盛產美菸之故。</p>
<p>記者等於十四日由都勻返筑，回想三日來參觀都筑段全部工程之種種情况，極感興奮。勝利以還，大江南北，烽火頻驚，年來共匪跳梁，尤爲猖獗，獨我西南一隅，尤其貴州，閭閻安堵，得以埋頭建設，爲國家保存元氣，實屬大好良機。都筑段爲我國西南大動脈之最後一段興工鐵路，於此國步艱難，庫空如洗，運輸不便，物價奇漲之際，能有此全部員司工役堅持刻苦耐勞工程至上之卓絕精神，實不啻我國所獨具之無上　寳，深盼政府當局善自儲用，儘早撥發必需經費，籌運必需物料，使此百里九十之鐵路工程，得以早觀厥成，匪特西南各省人民之所日夕渴望，亦爲國家民族在此風雲變幻瀰天洶浪之國際局勢中所應有之努力（完）</p>

<h3>陳納德將軍　論美國對華政策　克裏浦斯霍華特系報業聯合會版權所有</h3>
<p>— 本報編譯室譯</p>
<p>（一）對華政策的失當</p>
<p>今日，中美兩國的六萬萬民衆，正受着十年來美國對華政策失當的直接影響。</p>
<p>除非發生美國能在最後一刻切實理解實際情形，對中國表現合理的同情並作積極的援助這種奇蹟，再加上中國能在最後一刻表現出勇敢沉着的奇蹟，不然，就祗有兩種不幸的變通辦法：或者是引起第三次世界大戰的災禍，或者是引起全世界向世界性的專制制度投降這種更大的災禍。</p>
<p>兩者之中，無論發生那一種，全世界的自由人民都將承受美國因循坐誤所造成的悲劇性遺產。我們美國人會爲了走錯了路，不得不爲維謹我們的利益和自由而作戰，或者是不得不把我們的利益和自由可恥地委諸他人，這將是一個極大的諷刺。</p>
<p>在這些論文中，我想把美國這種失當的情形透露出若干詳情。我想說出誰應該負這種處置失當的責任及其理由所在。</p>
<p>我將說明人名，日期和地方。我將透露的材料中之若干部份，至今還是秘密的，其中有許多被埋沒在陸軍部，國務院和白宮的檔案中。</p>
<p>其中有一部份讀起來是不大舒服的。就國家的立塲言，我們不便承認我們曾以不正大的方法對付一個信任我們的友好人民的國家。</p>
<p>我們不便承認我們未能對一個盟國恪守諾言。</p>
<p>我們不便承認我們爲了要使蘇聯參加對日戰爭而出賣掉中國的土地，而事前我們又沒有獲得中國的允准。</p>
<p>要透露我們把中國最有價値的土地給予共產黨而對中國却未曾設法作任何補償，乃是一樁不舒服的事情。</p>
<p>我在一九三二年到中國，此後幾乎全部時間都在那裏過的。我組織並且領導了「飛虎隊」。我熟識遠東方面所有高級的美國司令長官，而在戰爭來臨之時，和他們一起服務。我以第十四航空隊指導長官的身份，深知美國對華政策的卑劣。在戰爭期間，我看到它運用的情形。現在，我在中國，正目擊這種政策在今日所產生的不幸後果。</p>
<p>在重慶那些黑暗時日中，我注意到將委員長把他團團被困貧乏不堪的國家團結在一起，並且屢屢號召他衣衫襤褸的軍隊去抵抗日軍野蠻的進攻。</p>
<p>蔣委員長的作戰，乃是在極大不利情形之下英勇領導的一個最令人振奮的實例。</p>
<p>就在他作這種偉大的努力之際，若干美國盟友曾屢刺其背。我說起這件事，就覺得可恥。</p>
<p>例如，在當時中國戰區美軍司令史迪成將軍在羅斯福總統和邱吉爾苜相面前攻訐蔣委員長的時候，我就在塲。我將叙述這樁事情以及其他。</p>
<p>總而言之，美國的對華政策以及若干美國在華官員的活動，並不構成一幅美麗的圖畫。但是美國人民應該知道美國對華政策失當的背景，這一點非常重要。他們可能爲了這種失當的政策而以他們子孫的鮮血作爲代價。</p>
<p>他並不想替中央政府洗刷它在對美關係上所犯的罪過。中國政府已爲美國的批評家就許多事情提出過許多次責難。我不能再增添什麼。但是我所說的可能有助於將這種批評置於適當的地位，俾作適當的看法</p>
<p>從一種狹義上講，中美關係的失敗我認爲目前的局勢就是這種失敗的明證—主要是由於兩種性質不同的文化難以獲得調和，因爲每一種文化都有它根深蒂固有時候不能容納其他文化的優點和缺點。</p>
<p>但是除了這種可以設想到的限制之外，還有着執行美國政策者種種不可寬恕的失敗，這種失敗，唯有在疏忽，偏見，短視，判斷不準確以及（我還得加上這一點，頗覺可恥）某種搬弄是非的傾向這種情形之下，始能發生。</p>
<p>在這些回憶中，我希望就過去十年中美國對華關係勾出一部份輪廓。我希望靠了這個辦法能够帮助其他美國人理解我們與中國國民政府友好合作方面所以困難衆多的背景。</p>
<p>一個基本的問題是必須答覆的，那就是：美國在以對日戰爭爲代價去維護中國門戶開放的傳統原則之后，怎樣可以容忍甚至帮助蘇聯共產勢力來代替在中國境內已被粉碎的日本帝國主義？</p>
<p>一部份的答覆存在於一個歷史的事實中，那就是我們並沒有眞正在中國維護門戶開放主義，直到日本發動了對珍珠港的攻擊。這是在日本發動征服中國四年之後以及在日本攫取滿洲十年之後。</p>
<p>這一簡單而嚴肅的史實，應該給予美國人一個教訓，就是想用低廉的代價和侵略者妥協，是永遠不可能的。</p>
<p>爲了要找尋我們對蘇聯共產黨在華勢力變幻無常的態度之其他原因，我們勢須去發掘美國人最近和爲大衆所承認的中國政府以及中國共產黨傀儡之間關係的若干方面。</p>
<p>這簡直是歷史家的工作。但是我們這個時代的歷史是如此具有流動性，致使我們不能等待它冷凝以後再去研究它的本質。假如我們一定要等下一代的研究人員去拼凑這個悲哀的記錄，或許是失之過遲了。</p>
<p>最近十年來，我國對華政策之失當，始自一九三七年，亦即日本發動征服中國之後。日本這一行動，在一開始的時候，就對美國以及世界和平的重大利益相敵對的。我們沒有做什麼，或者幾乎沒有做什麼。</p>
<p>一九三一年日本在滿洲的作爲，今日在蘇聯支助中國共產黨方面看到了類似的情形。這毋需得證明，因爲事實上這些傀儡是由蘇軍自日本關東軍方面奪獲的武器加以武裝的，而蘇軍之侵入中國東北，係出諸美國在雅爾達所發出的邀請。</p>
<p>一九三七年，日本在中國的作爲，不久可能又有類似的事情發生—這一次不是蘇聯照日本的式樣侵入，而是經由東方共產黨的傀儡勢力。計劃是相同的，而且從軍略的含義上講，甚或比日本最後終歸失敗的「共榮圈」還要浩大。</p>

<h3>蓉城萬里橋畔　醫學教育中心　華西大學</h3>
<p>〔本報成都廿三日訊〕出成都南郊，過有名的「萬里橋」，左行數百步，便見綠茵平舖，柳蔭夾道，崇　華厦，幢幢巍峨，這便是「戰時大學城」的華西壩。現在，教會五大學復員東返，碩果僅存的唯有舊主人翁華西大學。但，由於華大牙齒學院的名馳全國，華西壩在今天仍不失爲西南的醫學教育中心</p>
<p>四十餘年歷史</p>
<p>華西大學是歷史悠久的教會大學之一，公元一九一〇年〇遜淸宣統三年）成立。初設文理教育三科，民國二年始剏醫科，民三更設牙科，民廿二分置文理醫三院，在華大牙醫學院成立卅餘年當中，歷届主持人如林則博士，啓眞道博士，湯勃生博士，莫耳士博士，都是國際知名的牙醫學權威。由於他們的精心擘劃，勤懇培育，使華大牙醫學院的進步一日千里，斐聲國際，譽成東亞首屈一指的醫牙權威。三十年來畢業學生遍全國，在中國醫學教育歷史上，寫下輝煌一頁。</p>
<p>現在，醫科負責人是曹鍾樑博士，牙科負責人是林則博士。肄業學生醫科二七三人，牙科一五〇人，均爲七年制。第一年爲預科，二三年課程相同，包括組織學，胚胎學等基本教程，至第五年始分科，最後兩年側重臨症實習。七年修業期滿，經過長時間的臨床實　後，始能畢業。因爲學校方面實行科學的嚴格的訓練，所以華大醫牙科畢業學生，在全國執行業務，成績有口皆碑。</p>
<p>中國牙科之父</p>
<p>牙科院長林則　博士（Dr.Dirdsay），爲六十五高齡的國際牙齒學權威，服務華太逾三十年，先後擘劃中大及各大學牙科剏辦計劃，桃李遍天下，有「中國牙科之父』的雅譽。牙科包括修復，口腔等學系，分別硏究塡補，鑲嵌，醫療等醫術，此外尙有病理學及組織學等課程。至於標本收集，尤其　富，自原始生物的蛟魚頭骨，以及人猿鼠兔與各種人類的頭骨，莫不搜羅齊備。教育則全採美國制度，特別注意牙科與普通醫科　關係之硏究，着重醫學的通才訓練。</p>
<p>醫科剏立已三十年，在西南，設備的完善，歷史的悠久，可說首屈一指。一般設備，極爲完整，有深度X光機一部，專門治療病瘤，手術方面，內外各科均有獨到。附設解剖室，有解剖台六具，尸體均經防腐，每具尸體由學生八人解剖，自皮膚肌肉以至內臟層層剖解。曹鍾樑院長是內科專家，華大醫學院的內外科，在國內各大學醫學院中，是頗爲知名的。</p>
<p>今後發展途徑　華大牙醫學院對社會的貢獻，倘有實習醫院，包括大學醫院，口腔病院，麻瘋病院，肺病療養院精神病院及眼耳鼻喉醫院六所。均爲西南最負盛名的大醫院，此外醫學院圖書館，庋藏極富，有中西文珍本醫書六千餘册，醫學雄誌七十餘種。</p>
<p>至於華大牙醫學院今後發展途徑，據曹院長對記者表示：中國醫　進步，與歐美相差無幾。今後爲求中國醫學發展，首應推行公醫制度，務使醫生成爲專門技術人員，以爭取醫學技術的進步。牙科發展途徑，該科主持人之一的羅宗賚副院長則以爲：應偏於發現牙科與普通醫科之關係，以防止由牙齒與口腔之『病兆傳染」而釀成各種疾病，而華大牙醫學院的精神，則是鼓勵畢業生加入醫院或醫學教育機關服務，求取硏究改進，再從研究改進中謀中國新醫學的進步發展·（本報駐蓉記者周學端）　〔大華社訊〕上海兒童圖書館，爲慶祝本年四四節，特舉辦兒童科學作品展覽會，其陳列品均向由各校兒童征集。該館征集作品日期，原定今（廿八）日截止，茲因欲使全市兒童得獲普　參加之機會，特將征集日期延長至四月十五日止。至於該展覽會舉行日期，另由該館通吿。凡各校兒童未接該館通知而欲參加者，可逕往　海衛路（林邨）廿號該館索取參加辦法。　（本報駐蓉記者周學端）</p>

<h3>阿倫泰實力可畏　大公隊苦戰得勝　六十九比六十五分　延長時間始分勝負</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕美海軍阿倫泰籃球隊昨晚七時初次漏　於市體育館，觀衆二千餘人，這一塲比賽的緊張熱烈，誠足與華聯對大公之戰並駕齊驅。四十分鐘結束時，殺成五十九分平手，增加五分鐘之延長時間，大公方以六十九比六十五獲勝。</p>
<p>客軍石福勒之輕巧穩定，愛特生之來去無踪，常使大公人馬慌亂，二人可稱爲昨晚大公心目中之危險份子。綜觀該隊之打法，頭頭是道，平心而論，其實力並不在大公或華聯之下。且體格的健康，作戰的沉着，若能在市體宥館內再出戰幾次，塲地一熟，便當括目相看了。大公的演出，昨晚亦無懈可擊，兩軍始終以上塲之五將作戰到底，難能可貴。</p>
<p>兩軍接觸，屠文龍於右方揮中兩球，柏齡繼之，第一節大公以十六比八奠定基業。第二節美軍漸見活躍，比數接近，上半時卅三比三十，客軍頗有後來居上之勢。第三節發動後，石福勒愛特生，相互反襲，居然成卅四分平手，又以卅八比卅七超出，第三節四十七分平手，頗為大公担憂。末節最爲緊張，尙有四分卅五秒時，爲各五十五平手，愛倫犯規，蔡文華罰中，增添寳貴的一分，石福勒連進二球，五十九比五十六，美軍又居上，文龍罰中一分，文華角球得中，打成五十九平手，歡聲霞天。</p>

<h3>銀根轉鬆客帮進吸　紗布又猛烈上漲</h3>
<p>昨日棉紗市况，因同業銀根轉趨鬆弛，並聞陝棉又見暴漲，每擔自五百八十萬狂升至八百萬間，客路天津廣東漢口等號採胃重健，本街進取亦强，買風展開·因此初開各紗，均以高價喊盤·四十二支藍鳳細紗即一億元關邊，嗣聞布價報漲，人心更形堅强，行情　見飛揚，一路哄高至二億〇七百萬元收市。比之上日再漲一千七百萬元。水月及金城亦步昂一千四五百萬，廿一支雙馬紗以一億三千萬喊開，亦因布市俏，檯面帮拉抬，抬高至一億三千七百萬。迨近收時，浮多獲利了吐，回低至一億三千四百萬收爐。軋升六百萬。其餘二十支各紗，普升一成許。十六支十支等粗紗，客帮頗多吸納，大都上竄百分之十五左右。</p>
<p>昨日棉布市况，以同業間頭寸寬裕，並得紗似上揚之助，市塲人心一致看好。又加游資活躍。山西帮續有收吸，本街抵補亦殷，布號家進多出少，買氣轉濃，布價又吿上　。十二磅龍頭細布初開即狂跳廿九萬之鉅，爲四百廿二萬元，缺乏供應。一路直上至四百四十萬元收市，尙少賣出，較之上日飛漲四十二萬元。查塲外軋升二三萬元，惟最後成交，開　出貨，爲四百六十萬元，互有爭進。其餘五福彩球等各細布價亦回升自二十萬至四五十萬元。嗶嘰直貢以貨底稀薄，亦回跳四五十萬左右。此外細斜粗布及色布士林布等行情亦俏俐，交易　旺盛。</p>
<p>又訊：紡建公司供之龍頭細布價掛四百二十四萬元，准購單加價三十萬元，供不敷求。</p>

<h3>呢羢市況轉俏</h3>
<p>毛織品呢羢，前曾一度嫌貴，銷路應銷而忽暫停，形成互相擯持，交易無幾之事實。最近漸有活動，梅律斯·法蘭羢·凡而頂·華達呢·嗶嘰與淡色花呢等，本客帮均有點綴。蓋春銷當令，中西衣着添製發動，兼之百物價貴，呢羢各各貨行情，因此復又繼續向上。</p>

<h3>市場休假聲中　米糧均略見提升</h3>
<p>米市因下週一爲革命先烈紀念，市塲休假，則連星期日共停市二天。本街預爲添納者甚多，况銀根稍鬆，貨主因脫貨後須延至下週二交割，故均少售意。職此之故，價稍見提升。北市塲白粳三百七十萬元，薄稻·早稻等均升十萬元元。南市塲則略升五萬元。民食調配會在南市售出薄稻·早稻·白粳共九百卅五石·北市塲售出白粳二千一百九十石，價三百六十萬元。昨日到貨依然寥寥，計南市二千四百四十石，北市一千九百廿九石。</p>
<p>麵粉</p>
<p>銀根稍鬆，貨主不再抑價求脫，又因假期停市二天，並須延至下週二交割，貨主均少售意。設有求戶，扳價殊力，價乃急遽回升。老車粉初開曾做一百五十萬，後市稍回爲一百四十九萬元。兵船收市一百四十八五千元，計漲四萬及六萬元。紅蜂·建成尤爲散戶所垂靑，終升八萬元。雄牌粉送到價各漲五萬元。麩皮跟升四萬五千。小麥廠盤减爲二百〇五萬。</p>
<p>雜糧</p>
<p>本街均因二天之停市而吸納較多，貨主以銀根緊勢稍戢，不再輕售。漢口乍豆終見扳高五萬元，苞米靑帮雖納而不十分貧，故略升五六萬，紅糧交稀，菉豆·揀靑均呆，芝蔴稍堅，生仁廣帮重有納胃，升卅萬元</p>
<p>食油</p>
<p>本街添購不少，去路旣活，價乃一躍而上·廠方開售再提高，早市更見俏俐，後因散戶逢高售多，乃稍回落。大有豆油由七百六十五而七百六十萬元。其他豆油收市均在七百五十八萬之譜，各漲二十萬光景。生油交易亦活，靑島吉桶生油九百十五萬，亦升二十萬。生蔴油菜油各升二十萬，後市稍軟，豆餅乘勢上揚，各挺四五萬元。</p>
<h3>茶價均站高峯</h3>
<p>紅綠茶執主　於存底旣未砌增，抑且距離新貨生產期尙屬有待，因此對握在手中之貨，一味不忍割愛。而買戶仍以各方去化踵趾相接，又因市上銀根頻轉鬆　，進意毫不猶豫·但成交數量不多，行情供　站高峯，瞻望前途，恐有難遇其銳之慨。</p>
<h3>標準局推動　產業標準化</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕經濟部中央標準局，爲推行國家標準，頃特訂定說明書，附標準分類目錄，函工商輔導處，分轉全國各有關同業公會及大型工廠等，查照辦理。該局說明有云，產業標準化，爲提高經濟效率之基礎。並世各國，莫不努力推行。該局迄今依據法定程序，陸續制定，並呈請公佈之標準，業已積有成數。舉凡一般標準，及機械，電工，自動車，鐵金屬，非鐵金屬，化工，農業，窰業標準等類，悉已規定。茲悉：該局已定分類目錄，共計九大類，即一般標準，機械工業標準，電　工業標準，自動車及航空工業標準，鐵工業標準，非鐵金屬業標準化學工業標準，農業標準，窰業標準。</p>
<h3>業外雖有刺激　華股後不足</h3>
<p>華股昨中途雖受業外趨昂所影響，屢有振作，無奈隔前浮多擁塞，新買未來，後勁吿竭，近午終在斬多情况中不支下游。</p>
<p>晨初平穩，永紗以一八六〇元之價登塲，退至一七七七元及一八四三元。旋升爲一八〇五元及一八八五元，但以業外刺激加强，人心尙屬興奮，漲到一八三〇元及一九〇五元高價。因有趁高供售，降爲一七八八元及一八五五元。業外仍有刺激，最後一度回上至一八二八元及一九〇〇元後，嗣後即每况愈下，午收迫低至一七九〇元及一八五三元。較前收即交股計榮豐微漲，中法新華信誼跌半成，閘北信誼永公中絲恒　乎均平，餘咸小挫．遞交股除勤興獨平外，餘均微降。塲外各未上市股票均吿微降。</p>

<p>外股</p>

<h3>油脂價格波動　並非囤積居奇</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕本市油脂商業同業公會，刻陳明油脂價格波動原因，並無囤積居奇事宜。據稱，最近油脂價格波動之原因：（一）現正値肥皂大量製造，銷路即將暢旺，有資力者固多預購存儲，又皂廠配貨單祗三百餘萬元，而市塲售價竟高至五百餘萬元，比中原因，彰彰明甚。（二）油脂自戰後復員以來，世界各國，均感缺乏，國內又因戰事擴大，交通阻塞，搜購不易。（三）牛油售價，並無如皂業公會所云，每担一千六百萬之鉅。可責令各該皂廠，交出購貨成交單據，以爲社會公斷。（四）大源行最近向重慶搜購油脂四百桶，當局禁止遝出，現正多方交涉中。</p>

<h3>上海區銅製品產銷實況</h3>
<p>— 秦浩</p>
<p>（一）引言</p>
<p>上海爲我國最大都市，亦爲全國工商業之神經中樞，各業之興衰隆替，實足以影　全國。欲知我國某種工業或商業之整個狀態者，察該業在上海之情形，即不難得一槪念。銅製品工業爲重要輕工業之一，在我國亦有相當悠久之歷史，其業出品以銅皮，銅棒，（俗稱銅元）及銅絲三者爲主，其他各種件輔之。銅皮一項，又分厚薄二種，厚者俗稱銅板，薄者稱銅皮。銅絲則有普通銅絲與　銅絲之別。</p>
<p>目前上海一區，專製及號製銅製品之工廠，合計尙不足五百家，其中民營工廠佔　對多數，國營工廠僅中央　幣廠與資源委員會所屬之中央電工器材廠而已。但兩廠無論在設備方面或生產力方面，均遠駕民營工廠之上。民營銅製品工廠中，又可分爲輾銅廠，金屬品冶製工廠及五金工業廠三類；均以限於資力，規模較小，組織及設備不免因陋就簡，殊不足以擬國外同性質之工廠於萬一焉。</p>
<p>茲就國營民營各廠生產狀况及設備情形分別詳述於后：</p>
<p>（二）國營工廠</p>
<p>甲，中央造幣廠中央造幣廠設於江寗路底河北三號，規模宏大，廠址佔地八十畝左右。戰前原以鑄造各種硬幣爲主要業務，厥後政府施行紙幣政策，該廠業務，亦隨之轉變，乃改煉各種銅器，以應國防之需要。迨抗戰軍興，該廠奉命遷渝，惟因時間倉促，重要機器設備均未能搬出。上海淪陷後，該廠即遭日寇佔領，所有機件，大部均被拆遷，損失綦重；勝利後雖即復員，然內部已面目全非，一時似不易恢復舊觀。</p>
<p>該廠現有設備，僅軋片機三部（戰前原有十部）及二呎半立方容積之熔煉爐十座（戰前有四十座）。職工約三百餘人。生產方面，每日可鑄銅塊三四噸及黃銅皮半噸左右。刻正積極計劃增加生產，擬將工作時間由九小時延長至二十小時，預計届時可日出黃銅皮一噸以上，銅塊八九噸左右。其所用原料，除一部份係由物資供應局供應外，不敷時均向市上搜購舊銅元及電銅補充。</p>
<p>該廠現因煤氣不敷應用，故熔煉爐一律以煤油爲主要燃料，其法係積置煤油於離地面約十二英呎高度之一油槽中，使其自動產生壓力，俾煤油經油嘴噴出，再藉鼓風作用，使煤油直接射至爐膛。其火力能使懸於爐膛中之坩堝產生攝氏一千三百度左右之溫度，而將原銅熔化。</p>
<p>軋片機現僅三座，銅片可軋薄至〇·三米厘，惟闊度則頗受限制，最多祗能軋至七吋；但爲適應市上需要起見，目前僅軋四吋及六吋闊二種。</p>
<p>此外，另有退火爐三座；兩座藉烟煤產生熟力，以煆煉銅品，另一座則仍利用煤油，以產生熱力，因溫度較爲平均故所退火之銅品亦較優良。</p>
<p>該廠所出黃銅皮係以百分之六十五電銅與百分之三十五純鋅混合經熔鑄煆軋等步驟而成，洞孔及裂痕較多，銅皮須檢出重新回爐熔煉，故頗費週折。其所製銅塊，純銅成份僅百分之九十，其餘百分之十，則爲鐵質及硫黃，此種雜質之存在足以减少銅品之展延性而增加其脆性。</p>
<p>銷路方面，以銅皮較　，顧主均爲本市普通小廠商，尤以手電筒廠及鋼筆廠採用爲多。外埠僅九江南昌蚌埠等地偶有去胃，用以製造脚爐銅吊，面盆等用具。銅塊銷路則較呆　。</p>
<p>綜觀該廠目前情形因限於設備，故出品數量較少花式亦不多，尙待積極改進擴充。聞本市楊樹浦某敵廠中現尙存有軋片機一架，滾軸闊度達廿四吋，如用以軋製銅皮，至少可軋至廿二吋闊，該廠正擬設法加以運用。惟因該機原係用以軋製鉛片者，滾軸之種度與軋銅機有別，能否使用，尙成問題，目前正進行初步試驗。此外，該廠於去夏已派員赴瀋，謀接收該地造幣廠之各項設備，將其運滬應用，已否實現，尙無所聞。</p>
<p>乙，中央電工器材廠　中央電工器材廠上海第一分廠設於楊樹浦河間路八二六號，廠址佔地十畝左右。在抗戰期間，原係日人所經營，最初僅設輾壓工塲，專鑄銅皮，銅絲，旋復加以擴充，增闢熔煉工塲及電解工塲，計劃由粗銅直接煉製精銅，以謀進一步鑄造銅皮銅絲等。惟因當時所搜廢銅原料內之銅成份平均僅及百分之八十五，而熔煉方法又不佳，故煉成之銅塊，成份僅及百分之九十五左右，仍多鐵質等夾雄其內，殊不宜作爲電解用之陽極銅，因其所得電銅純度，尙不能達到百分之九十九也。故當時尙在硏究改進中。不久，全面勝利，該廠即由資源委員會接收，就該廠所有一切設備，另行統盤計劃改造，並將反射爐予以放大；（現可容銅料五噸）經年餘之整頓，廠內設備，大部已臻完善。</p>
<p>該廠現有設備：計鼓風爐（Blast　furace）一座，反射爐（Reuerberatory　furnace）一座，鍋爐一」座，電解槽六十座，退火爐一座，軋片機二部及軋製銅絲用之大小軋床四</p>
<p>生產方面，電解室每日能出電銅約一噸半；一部份機件，則用以抽製銅絲。惟所產電銅，尙不敷自用，猶須向其他國營事業機構及廠商搜購，以資補充。</p>
<p>該廠冶煉銅品程序係首將廢銅原料納入鼓風爐，俟其熔化，除去一部雜質後，即成百分之九十五純度之銅塊，再將其納入反射爐，氫化還原精煉，遂成百分之九十九成份之陽極銅，復將此陽極銅經電解工塲電煉，始成百分之九十九·九五成份之陰極電銅；最後，再經過退火等手續，乃抽成直徑三·一米厘至〇·八米厘之各種粗細銅絲，以應電氣工程上之需要。另一部份成份較差之電銅，則送往第三分廠軋製銅皮。其所出紫銅皮，厚度自〇·一八吋起至〇·二五吋，黃銅皮自〇·〇〇五吋起至〇·〇五吋。闊度則均爲四吋至十吋·長度方面，薄　約在三于呎以上，厚者最長可達八呎。</p>
<p>該廠所出各種銅品質與量均日見增進，故銷路極暢，惟規模尙待擴充，因就該廠現有各種設備而言，較　瀋陽昆明等地一般　銅廠，尙有相當距離也。</p>
<p>（三）民營工廠</p>
<p>甲，輾銅廠　上海市各輾銅廠原亦銅錫商業同業公會會員，以　製銅皮爲主要業務，旋因該業完全係一種生產事業，而隸屬於商業公會，名實不符，乃於民國三十五年實行改組，成立上海市輾銅工業同業公會·會所設於成海衛路，主持人為余中南君。</p>
<p>抗戰其內，各輾銅廠均相繼爲日軍佔領，製造各種軍用品；少數較大之工廠，機件設備，悉遭拆遷，故損失頗大，勝利後始由各廠主自行收回復業。</p>
<p>勝利之初，銅皮一項，因市上需貨孔亟，供不應求，各輾銅廠業務曾一度呈空前　榮景象，且因當時原料充沛，價格低廉，與製成品價格相較，約爲五與一之比，其利潤之豐厚，可以想見，因此新設之輾銅廠，如雨後春茍，　極一時之盛，奈好景不常，去夏以來，因市風不景氣影響，兼以原料缺乏，價格高昂，製成品利潤旣薄，銷路亦漸呆滯，故整個輾銅業又復陷入萎靡不振之　態矣。（未完）</p>

<h3>營口之槪觀</h3>
<p>營品位於遼河之側，百餘年來，悔岸綫泥土堆積，為遼河沖積之平原，故有「三角洲」之稱，於道光初年，始名「沒溝營」，以後改名營口。遼河上遊之牛莊，城田，莊台，等地之貿易，漸次移於該地。西曆一八五八年依天津條約，英國領事飽設於營口，乃日漸發達，為遼河農產物出口之要衝，大荳堆積如山，油房林立，自日俄戰後，地位漸次被大連所奪，故營口之聲價已減於當年。</p>
<p>營口人口約二十餘萬，街道整齊，河岸東西長約二里許，幅員廣大，昔為東北最大貿易口之一，為與內地商業經濟之最大連絡綫，水路運輸，異常便利，陸路為中長鐵路大石支綫之終點，四通八達，貨物散集，輸出有大荳，高梁，油，荳餅等，輸入則為藥材，茶葉，竹棉，陶器，糧，等物。</p>

<h3>掃墓節</h3>
<p>— 靖文</p>
<p>西人的復活節俗稱外國淸明，而我們的淸明節又稱是掃墓節，　兩個節日　然發源自兩種不同的民　傳　，但同樣是　　人類對於春天到來的歡　心情，同樣是表示人’類對於生命的愛。</p>
<p>就宗敎意義說，復活　原是一個帶有幾分悲哀意味的節日，因爲復活節的前一頁就是耶穌被釘十字架的慘劇，但相沿至今的復活節，已經夾　了許多歐洲中世紀農　社會　所謂異端文化。例如象徵復活節的彩蛋，即是因爲古時歐洲的農民，相信春分日生的蛋，可以經年收藏不壞，在復活節的一大，農民們帶了許多蛋到敎堂中去請牧師祝福。此外，在古代的農民心目中，蛋是上帝造物的傑作，它象　太陽—春天的太陽，也象徵宇宙。現在市上流行的復活節蛋，雖染有各種色彩，但最初原是　紅色的，意思是表示耶穌聖潔的血。</p>
<p>我們的淸明節—掃墓節，也一樣的帶有幾分悲哀的意味。譬如這幾天你從火車上眺望兩旁紙幡招展的許多土墳，你不由的會引起許多幻滅的幽思。你也許會想到自己雖然又進了一年一度的春天，但同時也是更一步走近了永久的冬天。你會回憶起你那些己故世的親友生前的音容，而想到他或她如今躺在寂寞的原野中已是多年，因而心頭湧起許多哀切之感。</p>
<p>我個人感覺，人類的哀切感情不僅是一種最高貴的感情，而且也是對於渾渾噩　人世的一服最有力的淸涼劑。當你站在你親友的墳墓面前時，對着供的不論是鮮花或香燭，不由你不對煩囂的俗世生活發生剎那的幻滅感，一切名利觀念在墳墓的前面是絕無站立的餘地的。我甚至有這樣一個可笑的觀念，如果讓全世界敵對各國的政治領袖與好戰份子在巴黎，紐約，莫斯科或其他各國的無名英雄墓地上去商談世界問題，敢信世界和平必可獲得。富麗堂皇宮殿式的會塲，向來祗是政治家們唇槍舌劍的背眾，從來未曾對眞正的世界和平有過貢獻。</p>
<p>但無論是掃墓節或復活節，在其悲哀意味的遠景之外，都另外含着一種人類對於生命的愛的觀念。復活節的宗敎意義固然着車這一點，就是我們的掃墓節，除了追思祖先與已故的親友之外，同時亦能對我們尚活着的生命喚起對於造物的感謝觀念。特別是人丁繁衍的家族，當你看到自己的小輩們圍繞在你祖先的墳墓面前時，你一定能代墓中人感到一種難名的安慰你的孩子們也許從未有過親近你上一輩祖先的機會，在他們的小心靈中即使對着　穆的墓園，也許無所特別感觸，然而你當然知道在墓內人和墓外人的兩　世界中，却仍維繫着永生的關係，而感覺到生命的格外可貴。</p>
<p>家族或宗族觀念雖有人議之謂封建思想，但實際上決不然。封建制度　是某種經濟制度的社會形態，封建社會可能產生族閥，惟與家族觀念並無直接關係。家族雖然不能離開社會而存在，不過我相信無論在何稱社會制度下，祗要人而知道他有生身的父母，家族的思想總是不會消滅的。原始社會的人也許無此觀念，然而今日的世界無論怎樣向後轉，大槪總不至於回到原始時代去，至少人的思想是不會的。</p>
<p>掃墓與復活在字面上似乎恰成對照，但其鼓勵人從已往中去追思新的生命，却是一樣。這足證東西文化的表現雖不同，普世的人心則一般。</p>
<h3>泥能治病</h3>
<p>— 道先</p>
<p>捷克是一個諸名的出口國家，但除了玻璃，工業品等以外，捷克每年還有大量的爛泥出口。當然這是一種很特別的爛泥，僅限於著名的「拍水帶泥礦泉」（Piestany）一帶的　泥。據說具有醫療價　，能治風濕病，每年都一箱一箱地裝往澳大利亞，南　，加拿大和巴勒斯坦的醫院和藥房中。</p>

<p>美國最多產的作家是愛德華。史屈來德梅耶（一八六二—一九三〇），紐華克人，他用了十幾種不同的筆名，專寫給小孩子們看的廉價小說。在他一生的後三十年中，他竟連寫了八百部這種小說，出售時得款在一千萬美元以上。法國政府現在每星期發行獎劵一次，每次銷售獎劵約五十萬張，每張售價約合美金二元一角八分，也有分條出售的，每張分十條，每條合美金二角二分。獎額共十三萬七千三百二十八個，獎金自美金二元五角二分至六萬七千二百元不等。</p>
<p>本年七月二十九日至八月十四日在倫敦塲行的世界運動會，參加者共五十四國，預計選手總數至少在五千五百人以上。與前一届（一九三六年，柏林）相比，參加的國家增加了十一國，選手增加了一千五百人。</p>
<p>美國的聯邦調査局（FBI）可說是全世界效率最高的警探機關，但成立迄今僅二十五年。目前調査局的探員達三千八百人，全部受過大學敎育後再經過嚴格的訓練。收藏的指　　一億六千萬枚之多。</p>
<h3>尷尬時候</h3>
<p>— 史郁</p>
<p>你在馬路上散步。假如你一口氣走到目的地，沒看見什麼，也沒邂逅到什麼，你這次散步便顯得毫無意義·假如你不小心拌了一交，或竟然與路人撞個滿懷，你這次散步才充滿了意義。人生的旅途即是這個樣子。假如你前世修來的福氣，一生平穩，你就過得太不美麗。假使你命途多舛，脚底下常常踩到石頭，人生就充滿了意義。沒有一個好漢不是跌下又爬上的；也沒有一本好書是一口氣寫成的。赫理斯向蕭伯納吹牛，因爲他曾「浪漫」過，而蕭翁却殊乏羅曼史可言。多少成功的政治家在暮年時嘆息終日，只爲了年輕時未曾坐得監牢。通常說來，豪富的人是最少了解人生的·但假如他破產了，下一頓晚飯便充滿了意義。</p>
<p>坐電重忘記買票，看電影忘記帶錢，在宴會席上打噴啑，在女友家的樓梯上滾下來。你帶了一百萬元請朋友吃飯，賬　開上來是一百十萬。這樣的情形在現實的環境中是常有的事。一個老的「雜誌文摘」上的故事：說二個不太熟識的朋友在交際場中邂逅：</p>
<p>「你看！那個穿大紅旗袍的是太刺眼了，穿得樸素一點會更適合她的年紀的！」</p>
<p>「你是在說我的表妹嗎？」</p>
<p>「啊！我的意思是說令妹旁邊的一位！」</p>
<p>「那是我的內人！」</p>
<p>這樣的塲合足以使我們混身「抱歉」。但說出來的話是無法收回的，這即呌做尷尬的時候。喜劇家趣劇家專靠製造這個「尷尬的時候」賣錢；人生也專靠這個「尷尬的時候」　爾。我們旣然是人類，天下就無「完人」·但稍有地位或稍有聲望的人總喜歡裝作「完人」的樣子。於是紙老虎一經戳穿，便笑料百出。據說紐約的新聞記者最愛與將軍談戀愛，與華爾街巨子談藝術，藉以製造尷尬的材料。</p>
<p>一昨出外閒步，在模範路的盡頭看得一個賣煨山芋的攤子·我是一個貪吃的人，想着已多月未嘗芋味，顧不得尊嚴，稱了一萬元錢，就在攤前吃起來·南京難民多　二個難童爭搶着我剝下的皮。我因爲他們搶得可愛，就稱了一萬元錢，送給他們。但一摸衣袋，却忘了帶錢·只得與攤主情商，說是明天給她，她就暴跳如雷。</p>
<p>「我不認識你，呌我那裏找你？」</p>
<p>「那麽怎樣辦呢？這二萬元錢！」</p>
<p>「點東西在我這裏！」</p>
<p>我給她手裏拿着的一册雜誌。她吿訴我現在報紙八九萬一斤，這本書薄薄的不值二萬元錢。</p>
<p>「怎麼辦呢？沒有可押的了！」</p>
<p>她將我混身上下打量了一番。最後竟看中了我架在鼻子上的這付眼鏡。</p>
<p>「將這個玩意兒押在這裏！」</p>
<p>這時管閑事的人已有一圈，將我們圍在垓心。我想與這個老年的女人是無法情商的了。我拿下我的眼鏡，糢糊着回校。</p>
<p>我們喜歡看「尷尬」的電影，喜歡聽「尷尬」的故事·但祗有親歷「尷尬」的時候，我們才體會了人生。</p>

<p>渚齋想到這裏，決定回家看一看，便吩咐車夫，拉到北新橋去，車子到了家門口，渚齋一　子錟，已經是十點多鐘，敵了好一會門，才見鳳　披着睡衣出來開門。她一看是渚齊，　問道：「你這時候來幹什麽？」渚齋含笑應道：「我來看看你，和你說幾句話·」鳳笙道：「白天不來，這時候來！家裏有人，你不必進去了·」渚齋聽她說家裏有人，陡生疑心，說道：「這是我的家，我爲什麼不能進去呢？」鳳笙道：「你走吧，進去不便。」渚齊那肯聽這話，一脚邁進門內道：「我要看看是什麽人？」鳳笙道：「是我的朋友，你不認識，進去也沒用·」渚齋向她一推，猛步搶進房內，只聽鳳笙在外面追喊道：「你在外面坐坐吧，別進去！　頭有人！「渚齋一切不管，一直闖進臥室，只見床上躺一個人，全身緊蓋着被單，連臉都蒙着，只露出頭頂上的一堆黑髮·渚齋看了，想鳳笙一定留下一個男人在她屋裏，不中忿火中燒，不顧一切，搶到床前，一手把被單揭開，一看嚇了一跳，原來是一個擦脂抹粉的女人，局雲散亂，躺在床上。急退下去，正要轉身出去，鳳笙早在後面，一把把他抓住，喝道：「渚齋！你太沒有禮貌了，這是什麽舉動？」渚齊又恐慌，又羞慚，急說道：「我……我不知道，請你原諒我·」鳳笙進：「不行！你給這位李小姐陪個不是，我中央情才放你走。」渚齋到此沒法子，只好轉過身來，對那床上女客鞠了一躬，連說：「對不住，對不住。」轉身走了出去。鳳笙跟在他後面，好像監視他一般，說道：「你走吧，今天且饒你，下次不許再來！」渚齋道：」鳳笙，我有話吿訴你，我們談幾句·」鳳笙道：「沒什麼可說的，你走吧！現在時間已不早了，你快走！你在這裏也不方便。」渚齋道：「這是我的家，有什麼不方便？」鳳笙兩隻眼睛一睜，　聲說道：「這是你的家？你沒有這個家，你走吧！」渚齋道：「說幾句話，你都不允許我嗎？」鳳笙道：「彼此話都說完了，現在不用說，走！」渚　道：「我今天所說的話，關係我們兩人終身的事，你不要生氣，請平心靜氣聽我說，好不好？」鳳笙道：「不！不必！我們兩人沒什麼事，我已經把你這人當做死了！」</p>
<h3>騙術</h3>
<p>— 糾糾</p>
<p>一八七八年時，巴黎有一位漢勃特夫人，她突然宣布：美國的一位百萬富翁克勞福已把他的二千萬美元遺產全部給她承繼。當時就有克勞福兩個姪子要求分潤這筆產業，雙方　訟不休，法院爲了調査困難，遲遲未能判決。由漢勃特夫人經手存在銀行　的各項證券股票之類，也因法院認爲產權未定，不能動用，迫得她祗得借債度日，聲明一等訟事結束，立即全部淸償。巴黎的市儈們明知這件訟案判下來一定對她有利，就乘機源源接濟—把利　提得極高，準備大發一筆橫財。</p>
<p>但這件案子一直隔了二十四年還沒有了結。在這二十四年之中，漢勃特夫人先後舉　達一千一百萬美元之鉅，享受着相當舒服的生活．</p>
<p>可是，到了一九〇二年，終於有人發現原來所謂美國百萬富翁克勞福者，事實上竟根本並　其人！債主們大起恐慌，趕到銀行裏把漢勃特夫人的保管箱打開，一看却裏面空空如也。</p>
<p>這許多債主中，曾有十個人因此而自殺。法院　新　審，才知道所謂克勞福的兩個姪子原來是漢勃特夫人的同黨，他們的　訟二十四年祗是欺人的烟幕，而顢預的巴黎法官竟實際上做了這三個騙子的帮手·</p>

<h3>西湖詩紀</h3>
<p>— 半夢老人</p>
<p>西湖風景之美，余取白公堤，其草軟如茵，花紅似錦，遠山近水，織或一幅絕妙天然畫圖，時有倩影雙雙，紅粧翠袖，當風和日暖之天，高臥花毯草褥中，喂喁細語，樂而忘倦，幾不知今是何世。</p>
<p>至蘇公堤，南北相距過長，比之白堤，艷冶較遜，中間除廣闊馬路外，尚有兩旁磚砌小路，掩映於埀楊花架之間，徐步往來，異常舒適，時則男女同騎自由卓，風駛電掣而過。余於淸曉或夕陽西下時，常獨坐一小亭中，　詩覓句，自謂淸福不　，偶成云：「衝風儷影兩車馳，夾道垂楊綰似絲，儘是獨行詩侶少，伴山亭　坐多時。（伴山亭名。）蔣莊近處赤闌橋，深院無人樹影搖，門外白鷗閒勝我，藕花紅處一雙翹。（藕花開時，常有白　翹足而立，與花紅相映成趣。）兩岸山光接水光，淸波一曲聽滄浪，倦來石　支頤坐，閒看輕舟蕩夕陽。」</p>
<p>余自杭游遄返，意志未定，詩友木居士，先往紫雲洞，復以詩促行云：「厭齋海上寄書來，問我山中消遺事，山居之樂樂無窮，安能一一從頭記。憶從　被上　霞，飽食終朝但嬉戲，朝來旭日滿東窗，勝地由來稱妙智。（寺名）淸晨一粥便出游，籐杖芒鞋隨所至，有時遺跡訪仙翁，　古井丹砂猶可識，初陽台上俯泉唐，烟水　茫看縱恣，喜聞金鼓飲黃龍（均洞名），信步偶然入古寺，興來閒　蘇公堤，埀柳多情勞蔭庇。行行忽過杏花村（在蘇堤畔），沽酒歸來拚一醉，紫筍園蔬俱應時，淡飯居然厭　　。旣醉且飽復酣眠，黃　一聲　鼓吹，攬衣當戶立風前，山色湖光奔眼裏，竹林松下儘俳徊，野草幽花饒秀媚，高峰獨立夕陽紅，射得彩霞落胸次，偶邀明月　柴扉，夜半淸輝入夢寐。日來春雨苦連綿，坐游省著阮公屐，空濛景色正當窗，瀲灔一刺幻奇異，山中人在畫圖中，領略畫圖眞景　。更有一事可吿君，日日面臨埋骨地（出山門，即見生壙處），此穴何年　此身，一旦長眠眞快意，噫嘻吁，還庵有庵不得還，厭　仍被　緣累，厭齋還庵二而一，厭而不還何取義，好景當前竟拋棄！」厭齋還庵，皆余別號，赴杭之念遂決。</p>
<p>嗣余於端節後，逕往紫雲，與木居士隔室而居，開窗正對西湖，嶺上飛雲，松間篩月，時見白鳥低翔，黃鸚對語，不覺俗　盡滌。以詩記之云：偶陪仙侶到蓬灜，洞府高眠客况淸，嶺上白雲閒似我，山中緇友話無生。（方丈志西僧，時來談禪。）晨餐坐對花千蕾，午睡醒來鳥一聲，塵世榮桔何必問，不關情處道心平·」嗣方丈以維摩　相似，余遂結跏靜坐，日維閉門習定，此時惟冀月點波心，風來水面，有光明澄澈景象。偶成云：「樓霞小住任淹留，（妙智寺旁，有洞各棲霞。）百念全灰萬事休，滾滾春華美點鬢，蕭蕭風葉月當頭。人生倐忽花間露，佛法慈悲海上舟，洗盡　襟無我相，條然天地一沙鷗。」</p>

<h3>On the Eve of the National Assembly Opening, the Chairman Issues an Important Statement, the Issue of National Representatives' Election Resolved</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 27th] Chairman Chiang, in order to resolve the issue of National Assembly representatives' election, issued the following statement on the 27th: The convocation of this National Assembly carries a dual significance. Firstly, it is to exercise the powers conferred by the Constitution and complete the organization of a popularly elected government. Secondly, it is to end the one-party responsible political system, enabling all peaceful and legal political parties in the country to jointly bear political responsibility within the framework prescribed by the Constitution, guiding the nation towards a realm of democratic constitutionalism and party politics.</p>
<p>As Chairman of the National Government, I bear responsibility for the nation before the establishment of a popularly elected government. I am also the Director-General of the Chinese Kuomintang, bearing responsibility for the Chinese Kuomintang and the completion of constitutionalism in the National Revolution. The resolutions of the National Government Committee and the Third Plenary Session and Central Standing Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang regarding the election all adhere to the consistent policy of realizing party politics and establishing a democratic constitutional framework. I bear the responsibility to thoroughly implement and have the power to execute the resolutions of the National Government and the Party. Now, on the eve of the National Assembly opening, regarding certain elected qualifications that remain unresolved due to differing political and legal viewpoints, I am responsible for resolving them. I believe that issues among comrades of our Party should be resolved according to the general practice of elections, allowing those with a greater number of votes to be elected. As for issues between comrades of our Party and candidates from friendly parties, they should be resolved through political means. Comrades of our Party should, based on the spirit of respecting party agreements and party nominations, relinquish their elected qualifications so that candidates from friendly parties can be elected. Only in this way can the purpose of convening the National Assembly be fulfilled.</p>
<p>From the time when the Founding Father advocated the National Revolution to the present, more than fifty years have passed. During these fifty-plus years, revolutionary martyrs and patriotic heroes who sacrificed their lives, shed their blood, and persevered in their endeavors, aimed at implementing democratic constitutionalism. Convening the National Assembly and establishing a popularly elected government are critical milestones for democratic constitutionalism. Today, the national situation is extremely serious, with the poisonous flames of the communist bandits so rampant. Only by jointly upholding the dignity of the Constitution and establishing the foundation of democratic politics can patriotic and democratic parties in the country follow the trajectory of party politics, respect and understand each other, cooperate closely, establish a constitutional government, abide by the Constitution, and assume the responsibility of protecting people's freedoms, implementing basic national policies, and preserving national territorial sovereignty. Only then can we overcome difficulties and accomplish the mission of suppressing rebellion and building the nation. For the sake of the country, the Party, the history of the revolution, and the responsibilities of the revolution, I have ordered the General Election Office to issue the relevant representative election certificates according to the aforementioned two principles. It must be understood that elections are a means for voters to express their will, while discipline is essential for revolutionary party members. Today, based on the Party's agreements, in accordance with the Party's decisions, and adhering to the Party's promises, I exercise the final decision-making power of the Director-General as conferred by the Party Constitution to decide on the issue of whether comrades of our Party should be elected as representatives and whether they can attend the Assembly. This represents the collective will of the Chinese Kuomintang and should not contradict the original intention of formulating election laws. Whether it is meritorious or flawed, let the public judge. At this moment when the nation is beginning to implement constitutionalism, I only seek what is beneficial to the country, helpful to suppressing the rebellion, beneficial to constitutionalism, and conducive to cooperation among parties. Comrades of our Party should then uphold the traditional spirit of Kuomintang members who are willing to sacrifice everything for the revolution, and no personal interest is beyond sacrifice. I deeply hope that all comrades will understand the Party's decisions, abide by the Party's discipline, sacrifice the individual for the greater good, and assist me in resolving this protracted issue. Even if individuals cannot participate in the National Assembly due to concessions, their contributions to democratic constitutionalism and the honor they enjoy for their loyalty to the Party and love for the country will certainly not be less than those who attend the Assembly.</p>
<h3>Over a Thousand National Representatives Register, Preparatory Meeting to Be Held the Day After the Opening of the Assembly</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 27th] The 27th marked the tenth day of registration for National Assembly representatives. Many representatives from various regions arrived in Nanjing. By the evening, a total of 268 people had registered, bringing the cumulative total to 1,032. Wang Chonghui, Xu Yongchang, Zhu Jingnong, Fang Zhi, Xue Du　, Gu Zhenggang, Hu Shi, Zhang Boling, and others had all registered before the 27th. The registration office was quite busy, especially with reporters from various newspapers waiting for the Chairman to arrive and register, creating a tense atmosphere. However, the Chairman did not appear on the 27th and may arrive on the 28th. (News of representatives from various regions arriving in Nanjing and registering is published in the first column of the second page.)</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 27th] With only two days left until the opening (on the 29th), the registration of representatives is unprecedentedly enthusiastic. Hong Lanyou, Secretary-General of the Preparatory Committee, stated that the number of registered representatives had reached over one thousand by this evening. Based on the surge in the number of registrations in recent days, the 28th is expected to be even more active. However, it is reported that there is rain in Hankou and the Northwest regions, and the weather in Nanjing is also unfavorable. Transportation for the representatives may be hindered. It is hoped that the weather will clear up on the 28th so as not to impede the journey of representatives to Nanjing and affect the number of representatives in attendance.</p>
<p>[Another Dispatch] The Preparatory Committee of the National Assembly held its fifth meeting at 9:00 a.m. on the 27th. After the report by Chairman Sun Ke and Secretary-General Hong Lanyou, discussions were held, and the following key issues were resolved: A. Regarding the proposal to continue holding the preparatory meeting on the afternoon of March 29, it was resolved that (1) according to Article 8 of the National Assembly Organization Law, a meeting can only be held if more than half of the representatives are present, and the legal quorum is based on the total number of elected representatives reported by the General Election Office to the National Government. (2) The preparatory meeting will be held on the morning of the day following the opening ceremony. B. Regarding the agenda for the preparatory meeting, it was resolved that the primary task of the preparatory meeting is to elect the Presidium to exercise the powers listed in Article 5 of the National Assembly Organization Law. This session of the Assembly will still refer to the agenda of the preparatory meeting of the Constitutional National Assembly, which includes: (1) Discussing the method of electing the Assembly Presidium; (2) Electing candidates for the Assembly Presidium; (3) Electing the Assembly Presidium, and a method for drawing lots to determine the seating arrangement of representatives may be included in the preparatory meeting for discussion and decision.</p>
<h3>Councilors' Association to Hold Founding Meeting Today</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 27th] The Councilors' Association of previous sessions will hold its founding meeting at 9:00 a.m. on the 28th at the Public Recreation Club in Xiangpu Camp, and will issue a declaration on the current situation.</p>
<h3>Zhang Boling Discusses the Situation in Northern China</h3>
<p>Believes a Major Battle Will Occur in May</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 27th] Zhang Boling told reporters on the 27th regarding the situation in Northern China: Since General Fu Zuoyi took charge, the military situation has improved, and the people's hearts are stable. He has great confidence in him. However, Zhang believes that based on the capabilities of the communist bandits, a major battle may unfold in May because the communist bandits will definitely take the offensive. The situation in North China is still considered stable, but increasing military strength is imperative. Next, the reporter asked about his views on the president and the presidential candidates, and whether he would participate in the vice-presidential election. Zhang said: "Some people have suggested that Mr. Hu Shi and I participate in the presidential election. I said, 'How can one sun and two foreign candles work?'" Zhang used this analogy, referring to Chairman Chiang as the "sun" and himself and Mr. Hu as "foreign candles." Competing with sunlight with candlelight is certainly impossible. After he finished speaking, everyone found his analogy humorous and laughed heartily.</p>
<h3>Short-Term Treasury Bills to Be Issued Next Month, The Issuance of 36-Year Short-Term Treasury Bills Ends, US Dollar Bonds Continue to Be Offered</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 28th] According to sources from relevant departments, short-term treasury bills will begin to be issued in April. The Central Bank has made prior preparations for the technical aspects of the issuance. As for the total amount to be issued, the Executive Yuan will determine it based on actual needs and the response after issuance.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 27th] The Ministry of Finance announced that the 36-year short-term treasury bills issued by the government last year, except for the first tranche of treasury bills, which closed for subscription at the end of September last year, the second tranche of treasury bills began subscription last October and was originally scheduled to close at the end of March this year. Due to the good results since the subscription began, the Ministry of Finance has approved the termination of subscription on March 26. All treasury bills sold, i.e., the first and second tranches of treasury bills, will have the principal and interest paid on March 31 (i.e., the maturity date of the treasury bills), and will be converted into national currency based on the Shanghai-designated bank's US dollar buying rate on that day.</p>
<p>[Local News] The National Treasury Bureau of the National Bank is still continuing the subscription for the second tranche of 36-year US dollar bonds, which can only be paid with US dollars or US dollar deposits.</p>
<h3>Constitutional Implementation Promotion Committee Ends, Farewell Tea Party Held in the Capital Yesterday</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 27th] The Constitutional Implementation Promotion Committee legally concluded before the opening of the Constitutional National Assembly. The Committee continued the unfinished mission of the Constitutional National Assembly to promote the implementation of constitutionalism. Now that its mission has been accomplished, it has concluded as scheduled. At 4:00 p.m. on the 27th, the Committee held a farewell tea party. Chairman Sun Ke presided over the meeting in person, and Vice-Chairman Xu Fulin, Secretary-General Hong Lanyou, and more than 100 committee members attended. Sun delivered a speech, stating that the Committee was established for exactly one year, and during this year, the work of various departments was smoothly carried out, laying the foundation for today's constitutional implementation. As it comes to a conclusion, we can confidently hand over the work of constitutional implementation to the Constitutional National Assembly. He then read his written report. Xu Fulin then delivered a speech. Xu first explained that the reason why the general situation today is tending towards a dangerous situation lies in the four words "poor politics." The current situation is like landmines buried all over the ground, and everywhere is on the verge of explosion. If we do not improve, we will become a large factory for manufacturing the Communist Party. However, if we want to improve politics, we cannot shirk our responsibility. Secondly, we should continue to publicize the Constitution so that the people can understand it and abide by it. We must attack anyone who does not abide by the Constitution. Xu emphasized that the Constitution was formulated by us and promoted for implementation by us. We must work hard to make it sacred and inviolable. After Xu's speech, Hong Lanyou made a brief farewell speech. Then, some committee members proposed temporary motions: (1) Sending a telegram supporting Chairman Chiang's candidacy for President; (2) Supporting Chairman Sun Ke's candidacy for Vice President, and organizing a campaign team. They were unanimously applauded and passed.</p>
<h3>US Congress to Reconvene Tomorrow, Foreign Aid Bill to Be Decided</h3>
<p>[US Information Service, Washington, 26th] Both houses of Congress began their recess on the 26th and will be able to do so on Monday　　, at which time both houses will face decisive action on foreign aid. The House's combined foreign aid bill will be completed for a vote early next week (probably Monday), depending on the number of amendments revealed at that time.</p>
<p>[Central　News Agency, Washington, 26th] Two Republican and Democratic senators today criticized a report submitted by the Senate committee on the aid to China bill. (According to the report, some parts criticized the administrative efficiency of the Chinese government.) Democratic Senator George said: The report　has some parts that are excessive and may be harmful to the Chinese government, and only increase　the current difficulties. George is a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, but he did not attend when the committee passed this report. George said he was very concerned about the report. Republican Senator Ball said: He hopes that the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Vandenberg, will make some corrections to the report when the Senate meets to discuss it. Ball　also pointed out that the report has a special color of the State Department's　policy, but this has no significant meaning. The two senators' comments may be a prelude to a fierce debate on the bill in the Senate.</p>
<h3>Lujiang Defense Strengthened</h3>
<p>Bandits on the Border Are Being Pursued and Suppressed</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Changshu, 27th] The river defense here has been greatly strengthened. The county government, in accordance with provincial orders, is preventing bandits from crossing south. All ports should be strictly inspected day and night. If　bandits are found, they should be annihilated with full force. Chu Cheng　Commander Yi Zhizhong inspected the city defense on the 27th and gave face-to-face instructions to all subordinates. Also, on the border between this county and the five counties of Xi, Cheng, Su, Kun, and Tai, there have been recent rumors of small groups of scattered bandits roaming around. In order to ensure public security, County Magistrate Zhang has visited Xi and Su　to discuss joint defense measures in order to jointly suppress them. On the 27th, he assigned Security Brigade Commander Zhang Qin and Deputy Commander of the Self-Defense Force Yuan Zhenru to Shazhou and Dongtang to mobilize elite troops to immediately join the garrison troops to launch a large-scale suppression, aiming to thoroughly eliminate the banditry.</p>
<h3>Extensive Suppression in Western Shandong, Firm Defense of Weixian in Central Shandong</h3>

<h3>Naval Vessels Suppress Bandits in Hubei</h3>

<h3>Yu Youren, Who Combines Literary and Military Prowess, His Students, Believers, and Subordinates Are All Supporters of His Election</h3>
<p>— Yu Youren</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 27th Airmail]　Who doesn't know that Mr. Yu Youren, President of the Control Yuan, is a founding elder of the Republic of China? Who in the press doesn't know he is an avant-garde figure? Among the heads of government, Yu Youren is the one the press feels closest to. Moreover, his current position is to supervise the words and deeds of those in power, strive to eliminate the corruption of the current government, and expose the injustice in all　degrees of society; this is similar to the duty of the press, following different paths to the same goal. Perhaps, he is even ahead of the press, not only daring to speak out like the press but also "daring to act" where the press cannot!</p>
<p>Mr. Yu Youren has a square face with an unusually long beard, as silver as silk, fluttering on his chest. He is a kind old man, but his tall stature and powerful voice show his decisiveness and progress!</p>
<p>He is seventy years old this year. Apart from his childhood, he has spent twenty years studying hard, twenty years running around advocating revolution, and twenty years serving the National Government. He has been in office as President of the Control Yuan for eighteen years. He is a scholar, but during the revolution, he served as commander-in-chief of the revolutionary army several times. When he writes, his pen is his weapon. When he commands, he deploys　military forces as if playing chess. He embodies both literary and military prowess.　He truly combines both aspects.</p>
<p>Yu Youren was born in Sanyuan, by the Jing River in Shaanxi. However, since the age of twenty-six, when he was deemed a revolutionary party member for criticizing the current political situation in writing and threatened with arrest and execution, he left his hometown and went south to Shanghai. Now, more than forty years later, he almost considers the Jiangnan region his second hometown.</p>
<p>He participated in and led the National Revolution, and he also needs to see the realization of democratic constitutionalism. However, he also believes that it is not necessarily necessary for him to manage these matters. He has never said, "I want to hold an important position in the new government!" However, his students and friends from all over the country had already launched a campaign to support his candidacy for Vice President months ago. But he remained calm, carefully considering it. I remember on the 22nd of this month, a reporter visited him, hoping that he would tell me that he had decided to accept the support from all sides and decided to run for election. But he didn't. In his living room with floor-to-ceiling windows, he gazed at the lawn outside the window and said to the reporter, "I'm still considering it!" I asked again, "What are you still considering?" He said, "I'm considering whether or not to announce it." This was a humorous reply, and he stroked his beard and smiled. Mr. Yu's campaign is not self-initiated, but in the end, he does not refuse it either.</p>
<p>The reporter once asked Mr. Yu whether the task of the first National Assembly required amending the Constitution. He said, "The Constitution has not been implemented for long, and it should not be rashly amended. If we talk about the principles or spirit of constitutionalism, it seems that we should not have the idea of making amendments. If we discuss certain details, there are still many that need to be tested in practice. Moreover, if it is necessary to amend the Constitution, a temporary National Assembly can be convened at any time. This Assembly should really only focus on elections as its main task."</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Shenyang, 27th] Wei Lihuang has decided to support Yu Youren's candidacy for Vice President, and he sent leaflets and a copy of Yu's book "Memoirs of the Second World War" to various newspapers for widespread publicity.</p>
<p>Various campaign organizations for Mr. Yu's election are being launched and organized throughout the country. They are mostly Yu's students, believers, and subordinates. This is a considerable force, so let's wait and see!</p>
<p>Li Zongren Delivers a Speech, Running for Election Out of a Sense of Responsibility</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 27th] General Li Zongren, at the invitation of the Student Union of National Chengchi University, delivered a campaign speech in the university's auditorium at 10:00 a.m. on the 27th. After the speech, he met with Professor Xu Ying and many others from the university to exchange views on the current situation. Li said that his firm decision to run for Vice President stemmed from a sense of responsibility and self-confidence. He compared himself to a modern young woman, who, when she comes of age and has the conditions for marriage, frankly seeks a rational and suitable partner and does not hesitate　 or shy like a country girl. He said that the position of Vice President is sufficient to realize his life's aspirations and is also his ideal partner because he believes that political reform should start from the center. If elected Vice President, he can assist the central government and complete the great cause of constitutionalism. He is also confident that he can assist the future president, sharing his burdens and worries. The general public in China is too indifferent to politics, and as the trend goes, the people must come out to supervise and manage political affairs. In order to promote a democratic atmosphere and out of a sense of political responsibility, he made the decision to run for election. Li also said that the purpose of running for Vice President is to seek more responsibility, not to be fond　of honor and make this decision. When Li met with Professors Xu Ying, Yang Xizhen, and Li Qingsong of National Chengchi University, he replied to Professor Wang Jingjie's inquiry, saying that the Constitution has just been formulated, and it is currently difficult to predict its advantages and disadvantages, so he does not support any amendments to the Constitution by this National Assembly. Li also reported on the military and political situation in Northeast and North China.</p>
<p>Cheng Qian Speaks on the Purpose of Suppressing the Rebellion, Reforming Politics, and Revitalizing the Economy</p>
<p>At 2:00 p.m., General Cheng Qian delivered a campaign speech at the invitation of the Righteousness Association, expressing his motivation and aspirations for running for Vice President. Cheng spoke for about an hour. He first reiterated his consistent view that the Vice President is a reserve position and should not establish his own platform or issue political views. However, he said that humans are political animals and should have feelings and ideals about national affairs. His speech was intended to express his feelings and ideals about national affairs. Cheng pointed out that the crux of today's situation lies in the armed rebellion of the communist bandits. He said that in order to achieve the goal of suppressing the rebellion and building the nation, the following three things must be done: (1) Reform politics, passively to rectify officialdom and eliminate corruption. Actively to implement the Constitution, establish a national system, guarantee the people's freedom, and protect the livelihoods of public school teachers. (2) Strive for economic revitalization, passively to eliminate the capital of powerful families and bureaucratic capital. Actively to revitalize agriculture, industry, and commerce, and implement large-scale Sino-foreign economic cooperation, and should advocate diligence and thrift as the foundation for economic revitalization. (3) Must implement peaceful diplomacy, so that China does not get involved in the vortex of world struggles, so as not to affect China's nation-building.</p>
<h3>Bandits Gather on the Outskirts of Changchun, National Army Cleans Up the Banks of the Taizi River in Southern Shenyang, Elite Corps Search for Scattered Bandits in Northern Liaoning</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Shenyang, 26th] More than 50,000 bandits gathered on the outskirts of Changchun, with their First Column moving towards Gongzhutun and Xinlitun in southern Chang, and the Sixth Column fleeing to Yitong. A major battle in Changchun is brewing. The defending army has strong strength and is sufficient to break any bandit attempts.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Changchun, 27th] Military News: There is fighting in Changchun. A small group of bandits attacked the Dafangshen airport in western Chang in an attempt to cover other bandit units from escaping the pursuit of the National Army, but they have all been annihilated.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Shenyang, 26th] The communist bandits in Songbei have launched a large-scale "movement to the front line." The first batch of newly trained and equipped soldiers, about 50,000 people, has been transferred from Qiqihar to Liaoyuan for reinforcements. The bandits still adopt a consistent cruel policy, driving strong men as cannon fodder to implement "human wave tactics." Therefore, the bandit rear is extremely empty, with no second-line troops.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Shenyang, 27th] Escapees from Jilin talked about several technical personnel who went from Harbin to Xiaofengman on the 13th to plan the repairing of the Fengman power generation equipment for transmitting electricity to Harbin.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Shenyang, 27th] Military News: There are no large groups of communist bandits in or around Liaoyang City, only scattered bandits looting food. The National Army is currently cleaning up both banks of the Taizi River. Also, the elite corps of the National Army in Liaobei, cooperating with a certain cavalry unit, is conducting a powerful search towards Kaiyuan Changgang. Scattered bandits are fleeing in fear, and the bandits entrenched in Kaiyuan have been shaken and have begun to destroy the railway. In addition, the air force bombed the bandits in Siping, Changtu, and Kaiyuan on the 26th, with great force.</p>
<p>[Another Dispatch] The Shenyang Security and Propaganda Conference is scheduled to be held at the City Hall Square on the morning of the 28th, with 150,000 people participating. Airplanes and tanks will participate in the exercises.</p>
<h3>Change in the Battle Situation on the Ping-Sui Railway: Bandits Avoid Decisive Battle, Main Forces Flee Back to Western Hebei; Air Force Achieves Brilliant Victory in Southern Chahar, Eliminating Over 10,000 Bandits in One Fell Swoop</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 27th] After the National Army on the Ping-Sui Railway switched to proactive offensives, the situation suddenly changed. National Army reinforcements between Datong and Zhangjiakou have arrived at their designated areas, and strong defenses have been completed at all important strongholds. Elite National Army troops gathered near Chaigoubu have advanced to Tianzhen and Yanggao, and small groups of bandits are fleeing in disarray. The two cities are now completely under National Army control. The remaining bandits who fled eastward from Fengzhen and southward from Luowenzao are also under close National Army surveillance, and their attempts to sabotage railways and raid small strongholds or isolate large strongholds will be difficult to achieve.</p>
<p>[Our Zhangjiakou Dispatch, 27th] The situation on the Ping-Sui Railway is deteriorating rapidly for the bandits. They are avoiding a decisive battle, and their main forces are retreating, causing widespread demoralization. The National Army is about to launch a vigorous pursuit. At noon on the 26th, over 20,000 elite troops from the bandits' Third Column moved from Beishaoying, Huaian, and other places towards Yangyuan. On the way, they were subjected to concentrated and fierce strafing by over 30 of our Air Force planes, resulting in the deaths of over 10,000 bandits. Commander-in-Chief Fu sent a telegram to the Air Force officers and men to congratulate them on their victory, and specifically extended his congratulations for the brilliant victory achieved solely by the Air Force.</p>
<p>[Our Beiping Dispatch, 27th] The situation in Southern Chahar and Northern Shanxi has eased. It has been confirmed that Nie Rongzhen's troops have fled back to Western Hebei from Southern Chahar. In the mountainous areas west of Laiyuan and west of Xushui on the west side of the Ping-Bao Railway, over 10,000 people have been discovered, and the National Army has strengthened its defenses. There have been minor skirmishes on the outskirts of Datong. After suffering losses and retreating from an attack on Kouquan on the 25th, a portion of the Communist bandits launched another three-pronged attack at 2:00 AM on the 27th. They retreated in disarray at dawn. There are no remaining Communist bandits entrenched between Yongjiabao west of Zhangfang and Datong. The railway has been heavily damaged. Military transport on the Ping-Zhang line remains busy. Sections of the railway between Juyongguan and Qinglongqiao, and between Xinbaoan and Xiahuayuan, were damaged on the morning of the 27th and have been repaired. The railway between Miyun and Shunyi on the Ping-Gu line was damaged in nine places, and the Railway Bureau is rushing to repair it. There was still fighting in the area between Miyun and Gubeikou on the morning of the 27th.</p>
<p>[Dispatch from Gui Sui, 26th] The main force of the Communist bandits in this area is south of Huaian. There is no fighting near Chaigoubu. The National Army's defenses on the outskirts of Zhangjiakou are tight, and the Communist bandits cannot launch a strong offensive. Their delusional attempt to "enter Zhangjiakou on March 29th" is doomed to failure. (2) Order has been restored in Fengzhen County, eastern Suiyuan. On the 26th, local Communist bandits approached Guancun Railway Station, 30 kilometers from Jining, and were repelled by the defending troops.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Beiping, 27th] The Communist bandits' offensive on the Ping-Sui line, intended to support the bandits in Chahar and Suiyuan, has completely collapsed after the National Army's counterattack starting on the 25th. The bandits in Miyun, Huairou, and Shunyi have been routed, and the National Army is clearing the area on both sides of the railway. After emergency repairs by the Railway Bureau, passenger trains are now running to Huairou on the Ping-Shi line, and full service is expected to resume tomorrow. Furthermore, mixed trains between Ping and Zhang will continue to depart from Ping today.</p>
<p>[Our Taiyuan Dispatch, 26th] The bandits attacking Linfen suffered a setback on the 25th, retreating a considerable distance. Over half of the bandits who invaded the power plant on the night of the 24th were wiped out, with the remainder fleeing eastward. The machinery was destroyed by artillery fire. On the night of the 25th, the bandits launched repeated fierce attacks on the northern side of the city, but were unsuccessful each time, leaving piles of corpses. The people assisted in removing the bodies. The bandits suffered heavy losses and have called in the Thirteenth Column for reinforcements.</p>

<h3>The National Political Council, Having Fulfilled Its Historical Mission</h3>
<p>— Lei Zhen</p>
<p>The National Political Council was established based on the resolution of the Provisional National Congress of the Chinese Kuomintang in March 1938 and the Program for Resistance and National Reconstruction formulated by it. Preparations began in early April of the same year, and the first session of the first National Political Council was convened in Hankou on July 5th. Counting from that time to the end of March this year (March 28th), its history spans exactly ten years. During these ten years, it was re-elected three times (divided into four sessions) and convened a total of thirteen sessions. Among them, the first to eleventh sessions were convened during the War of Resistance. Regarding the historical background and important contributions of these eleven sessions, I wrote an article entitled "The National Political Council During Extraordinary Times," which was published in installments in the Shanghai Zhengyan Daily starting on January 2, 1946. It was subsequently translated into English by the International Publishing House and published as a separate volume along with the original text. As for the evolution of the organization and the expansion of the powers of the National Political Council over the years, there is an article by Xia Jun Dao Ping entitled "The National Political Council in Seven Years," published in the Chongqing Central Daily on July 8, 1945, which is useful for reference. In addition, the Secretariat of the National Political Council has now compiled various important documents into volumes, which will be published soon to provide a complete set of materials for those who study modern political history. Therefore, I do not intend to repeat the historical facts of the National Political Council in this article.</p>
<p>The National Political Council's impact on our country's politics may be viewed differently by contemporaries, and their evaluations may differ. However, in the future writings of historians, the National Political Council will undoubtedly occupy an important page in our country's modern political history. I worked in the Secretariat of the National Political Council for ten years, from the beginning of its preparations to its end. Ten years is not a short period in a person's life history. I have accumulated experience and observations. Now, as the National Political Council comes to an end, I will briefly describe some of my thoughts to seek the guidance of the people of the country.</p>
<p>In the conclusion of my article "The National Political Council During Extraordinary Times," I once said: "Judging from the original meaning of its organization, the National Political Council is our country's highest representative body of public opinion during wartime." This sentence has two meanings: First, this representative body of public opinion belongs to wartime, so under the major premise of "military first, victory first" during wartime, the National Political Council should take "gathering wisdom and uniting the strength of the whole country" as its basic task. Second, this organization is only a "representative body of public opinion," not an institution that exercises "civil rights" during the constitutional period, so in legal terms, the government is not politically responsible to it. I personally feel that this point should be clearly recognized when discussing the National Political Council. With this understanding, we will not regard it as the Parliament of England or the Congress of the United States, and therefore we will not have excessive expectations for it. Faced with its contributions over the years, we will also give it an appropriate evaluation.</p>
<p>We know that from the first year of the Republic to the fifteenth year, our country was also a democratic country in name, with a parliament and several constitutions. However, in actual politics, public opinion was never expressed. At that time, except for the Kuomintang—the Chinese Revolutionary Party—the Chinese Kuomintang, none of the political parties had a theoretical basis or a clear policy. Politicians were fickle, only benefiting the warlords' separatism. This situation came to an end when the National Government unified the country. According to the Chinese Kuomintang's program for national construction, the country was supposed to transition from the period of military rule to the period of tutelage and then to the period of constitutional rule. However, when the government was vigorously implementing tutelage, the Communist Party rebelled domestically and Japan invaded from abroad, preventing the government's tutelage work from being completed smoothly, and the September 18th Incident suddenly broke out. During this period, the domestic political situation was not simple, because after the September 18th Incident, the government, with the intention of knowing itself and the enemy, had the determination to resist the enemy and the fact of actively preparing for it, but could not announce it to the people of the country. At the same time, it had to compromise with Japan in order to buy time to strengthen its war preparations. This painstaking effort was not understood by other political parties at the time. The Xi'an Incident was precisely caused by the Communist Party's exploitation of this situation. It was not until Japan launched the July 7th Incident and the overall war of resistance began that the government's painstaking efforts and actual preparations over the years could be fully revealed and understood by the people of the country. The National Political Council was also organized at this time. The National Political Council included social elites from all parties and factions and non-party figures, thus forming a great unity of national political forces. During the eight years of the War of Resistance, although there were inevitably occasional disputes in the military and political spheres due to the Communist Party's ulterior motives, the National Political Council always demonstrated a spirit of unity under the great banner of resistance. Even when the Communist Party sometimes did not attend meetings in an attempt to coerce, it never dared to declare its withdrawal outright. In the later stages of the War of Resistance, the government's various negotiations with the Communist Party and the Political Consultative Conference in early 1946 were all facilitated by the National Political Council. Although the results of these negotiations and consultations have now been completely destroyed, from the perspective of a historian, the political style shown by the National Political Council at that time—the style of strengthening unity—was far beyond the reach of the so-called democratic politics of the early Republic.</p>
<p>Political unity is a prerequisite for winning the War of Resistance, and the National Political Council has indeed completed its mission in this regard. Looking at it from the perspective of direct relevance to the War of Resistance, at the end of 1938, Japanese Prime Minister Konoe issued a statement of inducement and appeasement, followed by Wang Jingwei's departure from Chongqing to Hong Kong and the publication of his "glamorous telegram." That was precisely the period when Japan's political offensive reached its climax. Wang Jingwei was the Speaker of the National Political Council at that time. His defection to the enemy, as one would normally expect, would inevitably have a divisive impact on the group he led. However, in fact, the National Political Council not only did not show any signs of division due to the betrayal of a Speaker, but also demonstrated the determination of the entire nation at the general assembly held in the spring of 1939, passing the "Declaration Supporting Chairman Chiang's Rejection of Konoe's Statement." At this point, the enemy's political conspiracy suffered its last powerful blow. Subsequently, no matter how difficult the war situation was, there was no so-called issue of peace or war, allowing the entire military and civilian population to concentrate their efforts on winning the final victory, until the enemy surrendered. From this point of view, compared to the division of parliamentarians when Yuan Shikai usurped power in the early Republic, and the opposition between the northern and southern parliaments during the Constitutional Protection Movement, the National Political Council truly reflected the will of the entire nation and was worthy of being called the highest representative body of public opinion.</p>
<p>We only need to mention these two points to see that the National Political Council has already made a good start for our country's democratic politics and has completed its historical mission. As for suggestions and supervision of administrative reforms, promotion of the construction of the anti-Japanese base areas in Sichuan and Xikang, promotion of economic mobilization and economic construction, preparation and implementation of constitutional work, and the use of national diplomacy, etc., there are documents to prove them, so there is no need to list them one by one.</p>
<p>In addition, based on my personal observation, I feel that a question regarding the initial stage of democracy can also be raised here for discussion. According to the Organic Regulations of the National Political Council, the members of the council are produced in two main ways: one is by election by local representative bodies, and the other is by appointment by the central government. Due to several revisions of the Organic Regulations, the quota ratio of members produced in these two ways has increased for the former and decreased for the latter. In other words, the proportion of members elected by local areas in the total number of members in the first two sessions was smaller than the proportion in the last two sessions. That is to say, the proportion of members appointed by the central government in the total number of members in the first two sessions was larger than the proportion in the last two sessions. This evolution can also be said to have made the democratic color of the National Political Council increasingly strong, but upon further analysis, the achievements of the latter two sessions seem to be inferior to those of the former two sessions. We only need to examine the motions and inquiries of each general assembly to see a trend of being chaotic and unimportant. Under this trend, the waste of energy, time, and even paper and stationery is especially superfluous, and the adverse impact on actual politics and political style should not be ignored. If this phenomenon is said to be an inevitable and unavoidable drawback of the initial stage of democracy, as the British and Americans say, a "necessary evil," then we can leave it alone. If there is a need and a possibility to improve it, then we do not need to simply advocate high-sounding words for the way in which representatives of public opinion are produced in the future. Instead, we must give thorough consideration to the actual national conditions. At present, the various election methods stipulated in our country's constitution, except for special cases, are all carried out by universal, equal, direct, and secret ballot (Article 129 of the Constitution). This is the most democratic method, but we must also know that this most democratic election method was only adopted in 1918 in England, which has had constitutional politics for hundreds of years. In the actual election of National Assembly delegates and legislators this time in our country, how many of them can truly be used in accordance with the methods stipulated in the Electoral Law? This is something that deserves our deep reflection.</p>
<p>Furthermore, in terms of proposals, there are also things that deserve attention and improvement by all levels of representative bodies in the future. I have already mentioned earlier that in the latter two sessions of the National Political Council, there was a trend of being chaotic and unimportant in proposals and inquiries. This phenomenon can certainly prove that the members of the council from all over are concerned about the people's suffering and national affairs, and are actively proposing motions and speaking enthusiastically based on what they have heard and seen. There are many proposals in the political, military, diplomatic, and economic fields, and some people even have more than ten proposals each. There are many proposals and the session period is short, so they are reviewed hastily in the review committee, and then passed hastily in the general assembly. As a result, contradictions and conflicts are everywhere. This not only makes it difficult for the government to implement the proposals, but also shows that the position of the National Political Council has not been uniform. It is said that the U.S. Congress also receives more than 2,000 proposals from members every year, but only a few dozen are passed by Congress and handed over to the government for implementation. This is because the review committee has considerable power and conducts a strict review of the members' proposals. Any inappropriate proposals are unceremoniously rejected. However, our representative bodies often take into account personal feelings and are unwilling to openly oppose other people's proposals, even if they do not agree with them. As a result, they often pass them with amendments. The resolutions of the National Political Council are only suggestions to the government and do not have binding force. Although their content is somewhat chaotic or contradictory, it is not too important. However, in the future, the bills passed by the Legislative Yuan, except under certain conditions, the government must implement them. If the Legislative Yuan still inherits the customs of the National Political Council (these customs did not originate with the National Political Council, but the National Congress of the Kuomintang and the Central Committee, as well as the county councils of each province and city, all have this style), then it will greatly hinder the promotion of democratic politics. This is something we should pay special attention to. (March 28, 1948, the day the National Political Council ended).</p>

Mrs. Sun's answer was straightforward, just like Sun's campaign speech. Mrs. Li said that she was still studying and wanted to find out who was truly working for the country, who was just making empty promises, and who was sitting back and enjoying the fruits of others' labor. Mrs. Li did not draw a conclusion in her answer, but it is widely believed that her vote will certainly be for Li Zongren.</p>

<h3>Cash Flowing South from Changsha, Shortage of Large Bills in the Market</h3>
<p>Small Bills are Traded at Premium</p>
<p>[Our Changsha Dispatch, 27th] Due to the shortage of cash in Guangzhou, cash is flowing south from Changsha, resulting in a shortage of large bills in the market. Citizens rely on small bills of 100 yuan and 1,000 yuan for transactions, but prices are rising, often reaching millions or tens of millions. To avoid the trouble of counting, merchants are refusing to accept them, resulting in a premium phenomenon. The premium for 10 million is usually 1 million. The income of the poor is mostly in small bills, and they must pay a premium when using them. On the 26th, a rice shop was vandalized by the public for refusing to accept small bills. After the government negotiated with the Central Bank to exchange small bills, the procedures were complicated and ineffective. On the 27th, the premium had reached 1,400,000. Small merchants and porters were complaining bitterly.</p>

<h3>Guangzhou Customs Smuggling Statistics Exceed Two Thousand Cases in Three Months</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Guangzhou, 27th] According to Guangzhou Customs: From January to the 26th of this month, the customs handled more than two thousand smuggling cases, seizing smuggled goods worth over one hundred billion yuan. This figure does not include the three subordinate customs branches of Kowloon, Gongbei, and Shantou. According to customs officials, the smuggling problem in South China is not as optimistic as rumored. The number of seized smuggled goods only accounts for about 20-30% of the total smuggled goods.</p>
<h3>The United Relief and Rehabilitation Administration Distributes Materials Stored in Shanghai to Various Provinces and Cities for Disaster Relief</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Nanjing, 27th] After the dissolution of the United Relief and Rehabilitation Administration, the relief food and textiles stored in Shanghai were partially transferred to the Ministry of Social Affairs. It is learned that the ministry has completed the reception of 10,000 tons of food and about 600 tons of textiles. The ministry has coordinated the distribution of these materials to various provinces and cities for emergency relief. Recently, another 3,000 tons of food have been allocated and are being received and distributed. In addition, there are about 100 tons of used clothing, leather shoes, and other miscellaneous items. About 60 tons of leather shoes are unsuitable for refugees and have been handed over to the Capital Experimental Relief Institute's vocational training center for modification. After the modification is completed, they will be distributed. The remaining used clothing has been allocated to social and political agencies in various provinces and cities for direct distribution to refugees.</p>
<h3>The Public Enterprise Trade Union Law: The Railway Federation Requests Exemption from Promulgation</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 27th] The National Railway Workers' Union Federation recently submitted a request to the Legislative Yuan, requesting exemption from the promulgation of the Public Enterprise Trade Union Law in order to protect the rights and interests of workers. This proposal was put forward by Sun Yichang, a representative of the Jinpu Railway Union, and passed by the Railway Federation. The federation believes that public and private enterprise unions are both labor organizations, with the common goals of increasing workers' knowledge and skills, improving working conditions, and assisting the government in implementing national defense production, transportation, and other policies. Their missions are identical. If the same labor class is subject to two different laws, it would be inconsistent with national policy and may violate legislative principles. Liu Songshan, Chairman of the Federation, has expressed his views on this matter to the Legislative Yuan, requesting exemption from the promulgation.</p>
<h3>Retired Military Officers in Chongqing Request Payment of the First Half of This Year's Pension</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Chongqing, 27th] The Ministry of National Defense stipulates that the salaries of retired military officers are paid at one-half of the current salaries of active military officers in February and August each year. Retired military officers in Chongqing, upon hearing that the first half of this year's pension could not be distributed as scheduled, gathered more than 300 people on the 20th and went to the Ba County Regiment Management Area, requesting to borrow 20,000 shi of millet or 1 shi of rice, otherwise they would expand the petition. Director Zhu Shaoliang sent officials to stop them to prevent incidents, and urgently telegraphed Guo Chan, Commander-in-Chief of the Combined Service Headquarters, hoping that he could remit a sum of money for emergency relief. Our reporter learned that Guo Chan had sent a letter to Zhu Shaoliang from Nanjing on the 19th, stating that the delay in the retired pension was due to the funds not being received. The total amount to be distributed by the end of March was over 1.2 trillion, but the government budget was only 26 billion. Guo personally appealed to President Zhang Qun, who approved 1 trillion.</p>

<h3>The Beijing High Court Ruled on the Election Lawsuit: Defendants Gu Zhenggang and Zhang Lisheng Appeared in Court. The Original Lawsuit Was Rejected After the First Instance Concluded</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Nanjing, 27th] The Capital High Court underwent its first test after the implementation of the Constitution on the 27th, applying procedural regulations to dismiss lawsuits against officials responsible for nominating elected National Assembly representatives from party nominations and election affairs agencies, confirming the judiciary's non-intervention stance on the principle of party concessions. At 9 AM, Chief Judge Zheng Liee of the First Civil Division, along with judges Xiao Subin and Yang Yutian, took the stand. The plaintiffs Qiu Yingguang and Fu Xiaofeng, lawyers Lan Zaihang and Zhao Hui, the second defendant, Gu Zhenggang, the representative of the National Vocational and Women's Organizations Election Office, and Zhang Lisheng, the representative of the Election Headquarters, appeared in court for questioning. The first defendants, Li Shiping and Wei Qiongying, did not appear in court.</p>
<p>Basis of the Lawsuit</p>
<p>First, the plaintiff's lawyer Ye Zaihang stated that the plaintiff was based on the second half of Article 39 of the Group Representative Election and Recall Law, confirming that the number of votes obtained by the elected person was untrue, and that the number of votes obtained by the plaintiff was miscalculated, requesting that the election of the defendant be invalidated, and that all litigation costs be borne by the plaintiff, with the plaintiff receiving the election certificate and attending the National Assembly. Gu Zhenggang and Zhang Lisheng then stated their request to reject Ye's application, and wished the court to handle it according to law. The court then questioned the plaintiffs and defendants in turn. Qiu Yingguang stated that he obtained 6,742 votes, while the defendant Li Shiping (Youth Party) only obtained over 1,000 votes. However, in the list announced by the Vocational and Women's Organizations Election Office, he was relegated to the substitute position with the annotation "originally elected party concession." Fu Xiaofeng stated that he obtained 5,041 votes, while the defendant Wei Qiongying (Democratic Socialist Party) only obtained 152 votes, and the concession was not agreed upon by him. Both emphasized that the election was entrusted to them by the voters, and that neither political parties nor individuals could privately transfer it. The court focused on whether the number of votes was untrue and whether the calculation was incorrect.</p>
<p>Opinions of Gu and Zhang</p>
<p>Gu Zhenggang also stated that there were absolutely no errors in the number of votes. The reason for announcing the person with more votes as the substitute was explained in the announcement of the list on March 6: The National Vocational and Women's Organizations Election Office had completed the statistics of various election results and had legally determined the order of elected persons and substitutes. Later, it received the telegram from the Election Headquarters with the number 1770, regarding the list of party concessions that had been filed with the National Government, instructing to comply and issue certificates quickly, so it complied and amended the announcement. Zhang Lisheng pointed out that the principle of party concessions was a decision made by the Kuomintang in consultation with other parties. After the Kuomintang sent the letter and list to the Election Headquarters, the Headquarters could not accept the opinions of the political parties and reported to the National Government for approval before proceeding. He stated that he was afraid that the plaintiff was a member of the Kuomintang, in which case, his party could restrain him.</p>
<p>Four Points of Debate</p>
<p>At this point, Qiu Yingguang stated that he used to be a member of the Kuomintang, but he did not re-register this time and no longer had party membership. Fu Xiaofeng also stated that he used to be a member of the Three People's Principles Youth League, but he did not join the party after the party and league merged and had no party membership. Lawyer Ye Zaihang then stood up to argue four points for the plaintiff: (1) The Election Office's announcement of the list of elected persons is based on legal grounds, and party concessions have no legal basis and cannot use party agreements to violate the Constitution and destroy the law. (2) The defendant should bear administrative responsibility for executing orders that he knew were illegal and cannot shirk responsibility. (3) People are equal under the law, and even if the plaintiff concedes, he must agree voluntarily. (4) The plaintiff is not a party member and should not be bound. He believed that whether the number of votes was untrue or the calculation was incorrect was an internal reason. From an external perspective, if there was no problem with the number of votes, then other reasons hindered civil rights, which was unreasonable. Therefore, he filed a lawsuit based on Article 39 of the National Assembly Election and Recall Law. Lawyer Zhao Hui appealed to the court to cherish democratic constitutionalism and maintain national justice based on Article 139 of the Constitution, which stipulates that candidates should compete openly and equally, and Article 28 of the National Assembly Election and Recall Law, which stipulates that those with more votes should be elected. The plaintiff Fu Xiaofeng also expressed his willingness to see the government abide by the law, the law be fair, and the court be responsible at the beginning of the implementation of the Constitution. The defendant Gu Zhenggang insisted that there was absolutely no error in the number of votes. Whether the plaintiff was a party member should be asked to the Kuomintang. He personally would never shirk responsibility and would serve entirely according to the law. He believed that party concessions were a political necessity. Zhang Lisheng reiterated his request to the court to handle the case according to law. He, as a national official, would abide by the law and fulfill his duties and would set an example.</p>
<p>Reasons for Rejection</p>
<p>At this point, the presiding judge announced the end of the debate. After the judges' meeting, at 10 AM, the verdict was announced in court: "The plaintiff's lawsuit is rejected, and the litigation costs are borne by the plaintiff." The presiding judge explained that the reason for the judgment was that the plaintiff's lawsuit had no legal basis. According to Article 39 of the National Assembly Election and Recall Law, only three points can be used as the basis for a lawsuit: (1) The elected person is not qualified; (2) The number of votes obtained by the elected person is untrue; (3) The calculation of the number of votes obtained by the plaintiff is incorrect. This case has no corresponding points, so it is rejected. This election dispute, which caused considerable commotion, came to an end.</p>

<h3>Attempting to Cause Trouble During the Election Period: The Italian Communist Party Organizes Strike Teams; Mr. Sforza Receives the American Ambassador for a Long Talk</h3>
<p>[United Press, Rome, 26th] According to Italian government sources: After losing public support and becoming alarmed, the leaders of the Italian Communist Party have ordered party members across the country to take more resolute actions by any means necessary, including the use of force when necessary. The government also stated that the Communist Party has established a "strike team" headquarters near Milan, waiting for special orders from the Rome Communist Party to launch an offensive in the election campaign. It is also reported that the Communist Party has organized "action teams" throughout northern Italy. The current task of this organization is to attack reactionary political groups. As a result of this and other developments, well-informed sources stated that Italian Deputy Prime Minister Bassiatti will convene a meeting of the Public Security Committee of the Cabinet early next week to study security measures to be taken across the country.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Rome, 27th] U.S. Ambassador to Italy Mr. Dunn consulted with Italian Foreign Minister Sforza on the latest international political developments on the 27th for more than an hour.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Rome, 27th] Italian National Assembly member Mr. Wu Xifo proposed on the 27th that there should no longer be Communists in the Italian government. He called on all democratic parties to issue a formal declaration before the election not to cooperate with the Communist Party again. Mr. Wu Xifo stated that he will formally issue this declaration.</p>
<p>[United Press, Rome, 26th] Prime Minister Gasperi declared today: Although there are sporadic disturbances in various parts of Italy, general elections will still be held as scheduled. The Communist Party is spreading rumors that small-scale strikes and conflicts in various places may cause the postponement of the parliamentary elections on April 18. Mr. Gasperi's remarks are his response to this. At the same time, the Milan Grand Plaza has become a shouting match venue for Communist demonstrations for four days.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Rome, 26th] As the election date approaches, the campaign activities of various parties here are also becoming increasingly heated. The situation of each party is summarized as follows: Today, the campaign goal of each party is none other than Trieste. All parties unanimously agree that the port must be returned to Italy. However, there are many different opinions and disagreements on the actual implementation methods of achieving this goal. They are currently divided into two major factions. One faction welcomes the suggestions of the three powers of France, Britain, and the United States, believing that only the three Western powers that participated in signing the peace treaty can solve this problem. The other faction is the "Democratic Front" jointly organized by the Communist Party and the Socialist Party. They believe that the decision of the three powers regarding Trieste is only an "election trick" or even a provocative act. Only through direct agreements with Yugoslavia can the problem of protecting the peace of the Adriatic Sea be solved. The decisions of the three powers regarding Trieste have caused conflicts in various Italian cities. The worst case is Milan. The situation in Milan is quite tense, and the police are heavily guarded. As of yesterday, no major incidents have occurred.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Rome, 26th] Italian Communist leader Togliatti wrote in "Unity News" this morning that the decision of the Western European powers regarding Trieste is only a deception by the United States, intending to make Italy fall into the Western group's net and fill the artillery holes in another world war. After the April 18 election, servants who are willing to serve foreign imperialism will be expelled from the government, and the Trieste issue will be resolved to everyone's satisfaction within 48 hours.</p>
<h3>Yugoslavia's Willingness to Resolve the Trieste Issue Amicably; Tito Expresses to Italian Leftists</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Belgrade, 26th] Yugoslav Prime Minister Marshal Tito recently expressed his long-awaited opinion on the Trieste issue, believing that the suggestions of Britain, the United States, and France to return Trieste to Italy are measures taken for the Italian election, intended to prevent Italian democrats from forming a solid front to protect their freedom, and to prevent democrats from expelling those who went to Italy uninvited from Italy. Tito addressed many Italian cultural workers and representatives of agricultural and industrial workers who went to Istria to celebrate Easter and then traveled to Yugoslavia. Tito asked them to tell the Italian people that Yugoslavia has always been willing to resolve all problems between Italy and Yugoslavia that could prevent the peaceful and normal development of the two countries and harm the friendly cooperation between the two peoples in a friendly manner.</p>
<p>Tito also told them: "I hope that after you come to Belgrade, you can find that the Italian and Yugoslav people are friends, not enemies. The new Yugoslavia has proven that it is willing to make peace with all its neighbors, including the great Italian people. In the current situation, all democrats need to unite and fight against the propaganda operations launched by war merchants to alienate domestic and international relations. You can know the value of so-called reports that Yugoslavia is stationing troops on the border, preparing to enter Trieste, and that Yugoslavia has rocket launch bases on the border, preparing to launch attacks on Italy. This is just a pre-election trick to incite Italian hatred towards Yugoslavia. Deceiving the Italian People's Front during the election. The great Italian people should wake up, expose these tricks, and reject the plots of those who were not invited to go to Italy."</p>
<h3>The Soviet Union Has Not Expressed Its Attitude Towards the Trieste Suggestion</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 27th] A spokesman for the British Foreign Office revealed that the Soviet Foreign Ministry has replied to the governments of Britain, the United States, and France, acknowledging that they have received the suggestion of the three powers regarding Trieste, but has not stated the Soviet government's attitude towards this suggestion. According to well-informed sources, the Soviet Union should avoid expressing its position on this matter before the general election in Italy.</p>
<h3>Italian People in Trieste Plan to Request British and American Troops to Continue Stationing</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Trieste, 26th] Italians have launched a campaign to urge the Soviet Union to agree with the suggestion of the Western Allies to return Trieste to Italy, and hope that the American and British troops in Trieste will be stationed indefinitely. Italians believe that the continued stationing of the 20,000 American and British troops in Trieste is better than several poorly equipped Italian troops in green uniforms in preventing possible riots launched by Yugoslavs. This movement is seen in the "Voice of Freedom" newspaper. In the open letter from Italian Brigadier General Ellery, commander of the Allied occupation forces in Trieste, the Italian people seem to believe that the Italian army will show good combat spirit if called upon to defend Trieste, but believe that the stationing of American and British troops is better. Allied officials expressed sympathy for Italy's position, but expressed doubts as to whether Britain and the United States will grant their request to continue stationing troops in Trieste if Trieste is returned to Italy.</p>
<h3>Finland Convenes Cabinet Meeting</h3>

<h3>US Policy Change toward Spain</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 27th] U.S. pressure for Spanish leader Franco to hold free elections and reform domestic politics has eased, fearing such reforms would help Spain's communists. The United States intends to request nominal reforms in Spain so that Spain can join the Marshall Plan, and the United States and Western European countries will not lose face. But even this small request has been rejected by Franco. The change in U.S. policy toward Spain has been brewing for months, with one congressman defending Franco earlier this week, saying that Franco has been anti-communist for years, and that since his goals are in line with the Marshall Plan, he should be allowed to join.</p>

Registered members are close to 150,000. Seven or eight groups have been established in one district of Paris, with a total of 50,000 workers, technicians, and experts participating.

Participants in the groups are free to join any trade union. Baumel also revealed that the People's Unity Movement plans to expand its propaganda on May Day to attract the proletariat to join its front.</p>

<p>The US note was signed by Deputy Undersecretary of State Armour and delivered to Soviet Ambassador Panyushkin. It was released by the State Department tonight, stating that the Soviet Union and its Eastern European satellites are responsible for the division of Germany and Europe into East and West. As early as September 1946, US Secretary of State Byrnes formally offered the Soviet Union the opportunity to participate in the economic merger of the German occupation zones. The Soviet Union should not have refused; it should bear the consequences. In eastern Germany, the Soviet Union forcibly merged the Socialist Party and the Communist Party, and this new party has become a new bulwark of the East German autocratic government. Other political parties are also suppressed, discriminated against, and intimidated, preventing them from freely exercising their functions.</p>

<p>[United Press, Geneva, 27th] The United States plans to move at the International Freedom of the Press Conference on the 27th, advocating that all countries in the world abolish all regulations restricting the activities of foreign journalists. Brown, the publisher of the "News-Gazette" of Champaign-Urbana, Illinois, will represent the United States in proposing this motion. Brown said that the purpose of the motion is to end all disputes, such as those experienced by journalists in Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union. However, he admitted that the motion may not have an impact on Eastern Europe under Communist control. The motion also advocates that the final treaty at the close of the conference should include two major principles: (1) "Governments should encourage the mutual exchange of foreign journalists"; (2) "Governments should encourage the entry and exit of foreign journalists in accordance with the legal procedures for foreign journalists, and should not create special difficulties for the entry and exit of such journalists." Brown said, "The United States has already banned all Communists from entering the country, so Communist reporters are of course not allowed to enter the United States. They are not allowed to enter the country because of their Communist status, not because they are journalists."</p>
<h3>US Veterans Support Eisenhower for President</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, New York, 26th] US Veterans of Foreign Wars launched a new nationwide movement simultaneously in New York, Chicago, Pittsburgh, Detroit, Los Angeles, and other places today to support Eisenhower as the Democratic presidential candidate.</p>
<p>[United Press, New York, 26th] Roosevelt's two sons, Franklin and Elliott, issued separate statements today urging Eisenhower to run as the Democratic presidential candidate.

<h3>US Maintains Open Door Policy for Trade with Eastern European Countries; Export Controls Limited to Military Supplies</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 26th] Secretary of Commerce Harriman announced at a press conference today that the government has ordered that all materials, except those licensed by the Army and Navy, be stopped from being shipped to the Soviet Union and its satellite countries starting March 1, in order to avoid subsidizing the military equipment of those countries. Previously, President Truman also announced that military supplies such as airplanes, airplane parts, radar, electronic equipment, and small artillery detectors should be classified as weapons and not be sold to foreign countries. Harriman also said that starting March 1, the Army and Navy will have the power to cancel export licenses issued by the Department of Commerce, but this does not mean a complete cessation of US-Soviet trade. The government will still maintain an open door policy so that the Soviet Union can continue to be a friendly country. The United States hopes to obtain certain products from the Soviet Union, such as chromium and manganese, which are important raw materials for steelmaking. 29% of all chromium metal and 25% of all manganese metal in the United States come from the Soviet Union. The United States will supply the Soviet Union with clothing, cotton, tobacco, and consumer goods. Goods such as automobiles and trucks are still under review, and railway cars already ordered will still be shipped to avoid causing difficulties for American manufacturers. If the Soviet Union stops exporting chromium and manganese as retaliation, the US government will ask Congress to "implement important controls to urge foreign countries to supply the US with necessary materials."</p>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 26th] The first major event to be discussed in the House of Representatives after the Easter holiday is whether to ban any exports to the Soviet Union. Democratic Congressman Colmer, the proposer of the embargo, has indicated that he will ask the House to vote on the proposal.</p>
<h3>Iraqi Foreign Minister Dies</h3>

<h3>Hungarian Enterprises Nationalized</h3>

<h3>Romanian General Election Held Today</h3>
<p>Communist Female Foreign Minister Criticizes Britain and the United States</p>
<p>[United Press, Bucharest, Romania, 26th] With the parliamentary re-election scheduled for the 28th, Communist female Foreign Minister Ana Pauker delivered a campaign speech today, saying that we are fortunate to be free from the heavy burden of the autocratic regime on our shoulders, and we will no longer be forced to bow our heads under the autocratic regime.

<h3>Military Training Abolished for Female Soviet University Students</h3>

<h3>North Korea Holds Conference; US Does Not Oppose</h3>
<p>South Korean Political Leaders May Attend</p>
<p>[United Press, Seoul, 27th] US occupation army officials today said that if the leaders of the right-wing parties in southern Korea, who are opposed to the May 10 general election, agree, they may go to the conference convened by the Soviet Union on April 14 in the north, as it may be beneficial to learn about the Soviet Union's handling of Korean domestic problems. However, it is necessary to pay attention to the fact that the Soviet military authorities in Pyongyang's invitation to South Korean political leaders to attend the meeting may be a trial balloon to test what kind of strength can be obtained from the south, or an attempt to undermine the United Nations agency's plan, which would only increase the confusion of the situation.</p>
<h3>US Government Formally Denies Talks Between US and Britain on Holy Land Issue; Holy Land Committee to Travel to London Next Month</h3>
<p>[Our Own Report] San Francisco, 27th Broadcast: The war between Jews and Arabs was suspended yesterday because it was Good Friday, but it broke out again today. Jewish planes bombed Arab positions, causing heavy damage.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 28th] State Department spokesman McDermott denied that the US and Britain are negotiating the issue of Britain retaining troops stationed in Palestine. He did not know that the US had asked Britain to retain British troops stationed in the Holy Land until August 15, nor did he know that the US had suggested that the US bear the cost of Britain extending its stationing in the Holy Land.</p>
<p>According to British officials here, the US has not contacted Britain regarding the extension of Britain's withdrawal from Palestine. The US and Britain have maintained regular contact on the Palestine issue since the US proposed the trusteeship proposal, but this is only normal contact.</p>

If the US plan succeeds, the committee will not be able to exist, but it is clear that the US lacks sufficient support. As a result, the committee members were greatly encouraged. The plan to go to England was originally scheduled for April 7, and the US suddenly opposed the division, and the public opinion trip will be extended. However, due to Britain's decision to abandon its trusteeship of the Holy Land as scheduled, the trip to London was decided to be held.</p>
<h3>Japanese Overjoyed After US Announces Massive Aid to Japan; Rumors Spread That Japan May Be Allowed to Organize an Army</h3>

Industrialists expressed their relief at Draper's statement that the US does not intend to freeze Japan's industrial level at the 1930-1934 level. However, they said that without raw materials, this statement is "like a picture of a cake rather than the cake itself." The financial community agreed with Draper's statement that Japan must balance its budget, but at the same time felt that some US financial assistance is necessary to achieve success.</p>
<p>[United Press, Tokyo, 27th] Japanese newspaper editorials today were optimistic due to the visit of US Under Secretary of the Army Draper and his party, fantasizing about large amounts of US aid. According to government authorities, observers, and qualified personnel, the economic recovery of Japan requires US$3 billion, but they warned the people that they must take part of the responsibility and endure hardship before achieving economic independence. In addition, rumors spread that Japan may be allowed to organize an army and amend the constitution regarding the prohibition of war and the reduction of the emperor's power.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 27th] Japanese Economic Stabilization Board Director Kurasu Takeo submitted a four-point petition to the Draper delegation, requesting that the Allied Headquarters hand over administrative work and details to the Japanese government, and requesting the revision of the Economic Decentralization Act. According to people close to the Draper delegation, this petition was submitted to Draper after the meeting between US Under Secretary Draper and Kurasu Takeo. Here, Kurasu Takeo also suggested to Draper that Japanese people be allowed to go overseas to prepare to open up markets for Japanese products. At present, Japan is still regarded as the people of the former enemy country, and is prohibited from traveling overseas without the approval of the Allied Headquarters. Kurasu Takeo pointed out that in order to stabilize the Japanese economic situation, it is necessary to curb inflation, increase production, and prevent labor unrest. The four points provided by Kurasu Takeo to Draper for consideration are: (1) Increase the food ration by 10% to 20%; (2) Construction credit loans to Japan; (3) Administrative supervision by the Allied Headquarters; (4) Relax the scale of the Economic Decentralization Act.</p>
<p>[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 27th] US Under Secretary Draper's inspection team flew to Korea this morning. After inspecting Korea, the team will return to Tokyo within the next week, and the results of their inspection will be announced together with the report on the inspection of Japan after returning to the US.</p>
<h3>Japanese Government Accepts Demands of Electric Power Workers</h3>

<p>[Agence France-Presse, Tokyo, 27th] The Japanese government accepted the new wage demand of 5,358 yen per month for electric power workers at the cabinet meeting on the afternoon of the 27th.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 27th] As the strike of Japanese government workers continues to expand, trams and buses here are completely suspended today. Unless an agreement is reached between the government and the workers, the tram and bus strike will be difficult to end for a while, and the entire city of Tokyo is now facing the inconvenience of transportation in the coming days.</p>
<h3>Counterfeit US Dollars Appear in the US</h3>
<p>Said to Be Forged by Japanese in Shanghai</p>
<p>[United Press, San Francisco, 27th] US Treasury Department secret service personnel said on the 27th: In the past year, at least US$10,000 worth of counterfeit money has been shipped here from Shanghai, and the printing is so exquisite that it is considered the "most perfect" of all counterfeit money. The counterfeit money was made by the Japanese government for use in attacking the US West Coast. It is said that about 100 million yuan has been printed. It is also rumored that a bank in Shanghai stored too much of this counterfeit money, so it mixed one or two counterfeit bills into every batch of real bills.</p>
<h3>US to Conduct Deep-Water Atomic Bomb Experiment at Eniwetok Island in the Pacific; This Experiment May Have Already Been Conducted</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 26th] Well-informed sources believed on the 26th that the United States had completed its plan to conduct the sixth atomic bomb test at Eniwetok Island this spring. (Editor's note: Eniwetok Island is located in the southwest of the Marshall Islands in the southwest Pacific) Others said that this experiment may have already been conducted, but there has been no official disclosure. Still others believe that they have reason to believe that the first experiment to be conducted in the West Pacific testing ground is still a week away. They said that this test will be an underwater test, that is, a test at a "intermediate" depth, as scientists call it, at a depth of about 2,000 feet to one mile below the surface of the water.</p>
<h3>The Relationship Between US Presidential Elections and Business Trends</h3>
<p>— (Special Translation by Our Editorial Department)</p>
<p>Election years are not necessarily years of economic downturn. However, if there is an economic downturn in an election year, then the party in power in the White House at that time will almost certainly be overthrown. History shows this.</p>
<p>As for the trend of business after the election, it is difficult to say, but which party wins seems to have some relationship to the future trend of business. Truman's election prospects and the state of business in the coming months are closely linked.</p>
<p>The fact that 1948 is a presidential election year does not mean that business this year will necessarily be sluggish. The chances of boom or bust are equal. However, if the current downward business trend continues until November, then President Truman will likely fail in the election.</p>
<p>The transfer of the presidency from one party to another generally occurs in years of economic downturn. In years of economic prosperity, this transfer rarely occurs. In the case of economic downturn, only a powerful leader or an abnormal environment can prevent the ruling party from losing the election.</p>
<p>Based on an analysis of 21 presidential elections since 1864, there are some similar views on the relationship between elections and business. Everyone believes that elections have less impact on business, and business has a greater impact on elections.</p>
<p>In the 21 presidential elections since 1864, the White House has changed hands from one party to another seven times. Of these seven changes, six occurred under conditions of a downward business trend. The ruling party was overthrown in good business conditions only once, in 1912. That year, T. Roosevelt broke away from the Republican Party and ran as a third-party candidate, resulting in the victory of Democrat Wilson. He only got a larger number of votes rather than a majority of votes.</p>
<p>A ruling party has been able to continue to occupy the White House in times of downward business trends only three times. However, these downward trends were not the kind of deep recession that causes unemployment.</p>
<p>In these 21 elections, business trends were upward after nine elections, downward after ten, and unchanged after two. This indicates that the policies and general conditions of the parties determine the trend of business, rather than the results of the elections. However, the results of the elections seem to have some impact on the business trend after the elections. Generally speaking, the business trend is often better after the Republicans win than after the Democrats win.</p>
<p>If we were to predict the results of the 1948 election purely based on business and elections, we can say that the business trend from now until November will play a decisive role.</p>
<p>Past records show that if there is an adverse change in business, then the Republicans will almost certainly win as a result. A slight downward trend in business may also produce the same result. However, if business can stabilize or have an upward trend in the coming months of 1948, Mr. Truman's chances of winning can be much better. The possibility of the President's victory is proportional to the trend of business.</p>
<p>This is a prediction based on the normal circumstances of the election. However, Mr. Truman's position is perhaps more dangerous than what has been said above, under the siege of both the left and right factions. (Translated from "World Report" Weekly)</p>

The monthly payment date shall be the end date of the monthly rice allocation by the Civil Food Allocation Association. The district and bao shall remit the money as soon as it arrives. If the remittance is intentionally delayed until the next day, the family support fees for new recruits collected and remitted shall be calculated at the price of the month of remittance.

<h3>Representatives of Inland Factories Petition in Beijing Again; Seeking Japanese Reparation Materials</h3>
<p>In order to fight for Japanese reparations materials, the inland factories have decided to go to Beijing again tomorrow to make a second petition to the central government. Yesterday afternoon at 3 p.m., they held a reception for the press at Guanshengyuan to report on the progress. Wu Yunxiao first reported, saying, "At the beginning of the 'August 13th' Shanghai battle, the government sent Lin Jiyong to Shanghai to persuade the factories in this city to move inland to support the war. At that time, more than 400 factories endured great hardships to reach Chongqing, Guilin, and other places. They suffered heavy losses along the way and barely resumed work in the interior, making a small contribution to the war of resistance. After the victory, the factories returned to Shanghai one after another. However, due to weak capital, a large number of factories have not been able to resume work to this day, and the situation is miserable. They have repeatedly requested compensation from the authorities. Now that Japanese reparations materials have been successively transported to China, they have decided to go to Beijing again to petition the central authorities.

<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] A group of well-known Shaoxing opera robbers who robbed Zhou Dejun's home at No. 20, Lane 159, Jiulong Road on the morning of the 8th of this month, a part of which has been captured by the Hongkou Police Sub-Bureau. The details have been published in the 18th issue of this newspaper. The main culprit and the remaining fugitives, as well as the receivers of stolen goods, totaling 15 men and women, have also been arrested by the Police Bureau's Detective Section one after another. They have also confessed that they were responsible for the case of the Shaoxing opera star Yuan Xuefen being smeared with feces and the sensational robbery of the foreign girl Li Zhen's home last August 27. Li Zhen personally went to the police bureau yesterday to claim back one tael of gold, one watch, one marten fur coat, and one black coat that had been robbed. The case has been fully investigated and will be transferred to the District Procuratorate for trial within days. The details of the case are as follows:</p>
<p>Suspicion Involving a Distant Uncle; Confessed After Questioning</p>
<p>After Zhou Dejun's home was robbed on the morning of the 8th, Zhou immediately submitted a loss list to the Detective Section of the Police Bureau. Section Chief Zheng personally led Squad Leader Feng Qishan, officers Qin Boliang and Gao Fuhai, and others to Zhou's residence to conduct an investigation. They discovered that the robbed gold jewelry was placed in a secret location, which could not have been known to outsiders. Therefore, it was determined that the robbers in this case must have a close relationship with the Zhou family. After questioning the victim in detail, it was learned that Zhou had a distant uncle named Zhou Lansheng, a 53-year-old tailor from Shaoxing, who had recently made new clothes at Zhou's house and had lived there for a long time. He was highly suspected. However, his address was uncertain, and it was difficult to start an investigation. After Section Chief Kuang dispatched officers to investigate in all directions, Zhou was arrested at the home of Jin Tang, a Shaoxing native, at No. 18 Hengmao Lane, South Tibet Road at 7 p.m. on the same day. At first, he tried to deny it, but after strict interrogation, he confessed that he provided clues and colluded with five robbers from his hometown, Li Liangchen, Yin Xitang, Shen Jifa, Sun Zilong, and Yu Zhijiang. He also confessed that in the 35th year, he had colluded with Li Liangchen, Wang Yiqing, Yang Miaolao, and Mai Xianghui in the same way to rob Zhang Rongkang's home at No. 44, Lane 288, Yuezhou Road, and divided 40,000 yuan and gold jewelry afterward. According to the confession, the police bureau immediately arrested Wang Yiqing, Qiu Xianghui, and Yang Miaolao at their respective addresses. Arrested Accomplices in Zhenhai and Zhoushan</p>
<p>At that time, the Hongkou Police Sub-Bureau also received a report and dispatched officers to assist. That night, Li Liangchen was arrested behind the stage of the Enpaiya Shaoxing Opera Theater on Lin Sen Middle Road. According to Li's confession, Yin Xitang and Shen Jifa, two accomplices, were arrested in Zhenhai and Zhoushan, and stolen goods and firearms were seized. After that, the General Bureau continued to investigate based on clues from various sources. It was soon learned that another accomplice, Sun Zhilong, was hiding in a shed on Guangfu West Road in western Shanghai. They immediately went to arrest Sun. According to Shen's confession, the receivers of stolen goods, Sun Zhu, Chen Sun, Hu Jinman, Zhao Gaogen, Yu Wang Zhibang (Yu Zhijiang's wife), Chen Zhang Xiaomei, and Zhu Jinmiao, were arrested one after another. In Yu Wang Zhibang's home, the clothes robbed from Li Zhen, a red dancer, at No. 4, Lane 1112, Yuyuan Road on November 8 last year, were found. After further investigation, the suspect Sun Zhilong confessed that they were also responsible for the robbery of Li Zhen's home.</p>
<p>Stolen Goods Worth Over 3 Billion Unearthed</p>
<p>At the same time, Zhu Jinmiao also confessed that on August 27 last year, she was instructed by Yin Guifang, Zhang Zhifan, and Xu Yuexing to send someone to throw feces at Shaoxing opera actress Yuan Xuefen. According to the confession, the police bureau summoned Yin and the other two to the bureau for questioning, and it was confirmed to be true. They will be transferred to the District Procuratorate on suspicion of infringing on freedom. In summary, a total of 15 men and women were arrested, involving four or five cases (excluding Yin and the other three who were at large). In addition to seizing two pistols, the stolen goods unearthed included five 10-tael gold bars, one 1-tael gold bar, 500 US dollars, two diamond rings over one carat, more than a dozen gold rings, three gold bracelets, one watch, and clothing, with a total value of approximately 3 billion yuan.</p>
<p>In addition to the Hongkou Sub-Bureau, the officers who worked hard on this case from the General Bureau included Section Chief Kuang Junhou, Squad Leader Feng Qishan, Deputy Squad Leader Feng Xiushan, Officer Qin Boliang, and officers Qian Daxin, Ma Bingzhang, Liu Zhaolong, Zhang Yunming, Zhang Jianyun, Guo Wangping, Guo Ruimin, Shao Guanrong, and Lu Yixin. The Bureau Chief will commend them.</p>

<h3>Citizens' Mentality Towards Police Should Be Improved; Zhang Yiqu Invited to Broadcast</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] City Councilor Zhang Yiqu was invited by Director Yu Shuping to broadcast on the City Police Bureau radio station at 3 p.m. yesterday (the 27th). The topic of the broadcast was "Improving Citizens' Mentality Towards the Police." He stated that most citizens, except for those with a higher level of knowledge, still have three erroneous mentalities: (1) Fear mentality; (2) Contempt mentality; (3) Hatred mentality. He went on to say: "The police are not scary people. They faithfully maintain order for the citizens. They are friends of the citizens. We citizens should have a loving mentality and not a fearful mentality. The police guard doors for people and manage traffic for people. They should not be regarded as menial workers. Their spirit of service is noble. We citizens should have a respectful mentality and not a contemptuous mentality. The police maintain local public security and correct the illegal behavior of one or two citizens. We citizens should have a grateful mentality and not a hatred mentality." Finally, he deeply hoped that citizens would improve their mentality, and at the same time, he deeply hoped that the police would improve their quality and work harder.</p>

<h3>Discovery of a Knife-Wounded Male Corpse on the Wusong River Bank</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] Yesterday morning at eight o'clock, a male corpse was discovered in the Wusong Taixing Road riverbank. The victim appeared to be approximately 40 years old, wearing military uniform, with a total of four knife wounds to the head and left arm. Upon receiving the news, the Wusong Police Station, led by Chief Xu Fan, dispatched officers to investigate. A significant amount of blood was found 80 meters away from the corpse, along with a flashlight and a local-style hoe. It is presumed that the deceased was attacked at that location and then moved to the riverbank. 140,000 legal tender, seven 1,000-yuan gold bond notes, and a service certificate from the Wuhan Clothing Factory, along with a wooden seal bearing the name Zhou Mingsheng, were found in the deceased's pocket. The case is currently under investigation by the station.</p>
<h3>Driven by Cold and Hunger, Visiting a Friend: The Lamentable Situation of a Disappointed Intellectual; Fortunately, No Losses at the Bank of China Dormitory</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] Wang Xiaoxiang, 30 years old, from Jintan, once worked as a teacher at a school in Suzhou. Due to meager income insufficient for sustenance, he entrusted a friend, Tang Mingxian, working at the Bank of China in this city, to seek employment at the bank. Upon Tang's affirmative reply, Wang came to Shanghai from Suzhou on the 10th of this month. However, when Wang arrived in Shanghai, Tang had gone to Beijing on business. Wang's travel expenses were only sufficient for the journey to Shanghai, leaving him unable to afford lodging or return to Suzhou. He sat in the corridor of the Bank of China dormitory, and in the middle of the night, feeling hungry and cold, he noticed that the window of dormitory room 304 was not closed. Seeing overcoats, woolen sweaters and other items inside, he conceived the idea of theft. He sneaked into the room and stole some clothing, intending to escape. Unexpectedly, unfamiliar with the surroundings, he entered the room of a stationed guard, who apprehended him and turned him over to the court. Yesterday, Judge Zhong Xianda of the District Court opened the trial. Wang confessed the situation. Judge Zhong, finding the circumstances of his crime pitiable, imposed a lenient sentence, sentencing him to six months of imprisonment, suspended for two years.</p>

<h3>A Repair Ship Steaming into the National Gate: The Romance of the "Xing'an"</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper in Nanjing, 26th] The first scene: March 22, 1948, General Gui Yongqing, acting commander-in-chief of the Navy of the Republic of China, held a press conference in the mess hall of a warship in Xiaguan, Nanjing. The room was decorated with ceremonial flags. Seated to his left was Commander Xu Shifu, the ship's captain. The camera moved outside the cabin, sweeping from the bow to the stern. This was the repair ship "Xing'an."</p>
<p>The second scene: December 8, 1947, Minister of Foreign Affairs Dr. Wang Shijie and Ambassador Stuart signed the Sino-American Naval Agreement in the reception room of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. According to this agreement, the United States, to assist us in building our navy, would donate 271 surplus ships below the escort destroyer class to China, including two repair ships, one being the 15,000-ton "Emei" and the other being the "Xing'an."</p>
<p>The third scene: June 28, 1947, Captain Xu Shifu led 98 officers and soldiers to New Orleans, a port on the Gulf Coast of the southern United States. They faced the predecessor of the "Xing'an," the "Achilles," a dead ship that could neither sound nor move. A small soldier's disappointed face, a disappointed voice:</p>
<p>"Is this the ship we came all the way from the motherland to receive? We are so sad that we are about to cry."</p>
<p>This is a Gift, This is Friendship</p>
<p>However, this is a gift, this is friendship, and most importantly, even this broken thing is something we don't have in China, and it is precisely what the motherland needs. The construction of the new Chinese Navy is difficult, and only by overcoming difficulties can we succeed. Captain Xu said:</p>
<p>"Our mission is to receive the ship, and we must bring this ship back to the national gate no matter what." In the scorching weather, these 99 officers and soldiers sweated and braved the sun, working diligently on the scorching deck and in the sweltering oil hold, carrying out the work of restoring the old and making the new, until the end of the year.</p>
<p>The predecessor of the "Xing'an" was the US Navy's No. 455 Landing Ship Tank. It began its service in the fleet on January 10, 1943. On May 2, it sailed to Sydney, Australia, and was converted into a repair ship. On June 2, it began its mission in Milne, New Guinea. In September, it participated in the Buna landing operation in New Guinea, where the stern soldier's cabin was bombed by Japanese aircraft, and the underwater propeller was also destroyed. In August 1944, it was named "Achilles" and designated as Landing Repair Ship No. 41. In October, it participated in the Leyte Island landing operation in the Philippines, where a Japanese suicide plane crashed onto the bow of the ship, killing the entire repair crew and creating a large hole in the deck. On June 10, 1945, it participated in the Brunei landing operation in Borneo. After the Japanese surrender, it returned to the United States and docked in New Orleans, where it was "decommissioned" in January 1946.</p>
<p>Surface Decommissioning, Actual Scrapping</p>
<p>The "decommissioning" here is actually "scrapping." The design of landing craft was originally for short-term use, and the construction of various parts was extremely crude. After the "Achilles" was converted into a repair ship, although the equipment of the repair department was increased, the basic equipment such as the hull and frame could not be transformed. Therefore, after suffering heavy damage in two landing operations, this original No. 455 Landing Ship Tank, compared to the same class of younger landing ship tanks (such as Zhonghai, Zhongquan, etc., whose numbers are all around 1,000) that had already been received in Qingdao last year, could be said to be extremely dilapidated. Before the Chinese government commissioned the US government to solicit merchants to repair it on its behalf, the wounds of the "Achilles" had not healed, the deck was twisted and deformed, and covered with layers of rust, the waterproof compartments in the hold were completely destroyed, the ammunition depot equipment was empty, and the diesel fuel had been poured into the freshwater tank. If the "retired" "Achilles" did not have a complete set of machinery and equipment, it would have been no different from scrap iron. The uniquely blessed US Navy would naturally "scrap" it.</p>
<p>40,000 US Dollars, Solicit Merchants to Repair</p>
<p>The "Achilles" that the Chinese ship receiving officers saw in New Orleans was still what it looked like after the US government had solicited merchants to repair it on our behalf after we had spent 40,000 US dollars. However, the workers who received a wage of 14 dollars a day and the contractors who handled the repair did not do their best to sufficiently improve the condition of the ship, because in the eyes of Americans, it was considered a waste of effort to spend effort on "scrap iron." What 40,000 dollars bought was a layer of paint applied on top of the thick rust on the deck, the waterproof compartments in the hold repaired, and the badly damaged right main engine partially replaced, but the dead ship was still a dead ship, still neither sounding nor moving.</p>
<p>Like houses that have been abandoned for a long time, the "Achilles" had no water or electricity, and was sealed by heavy dust. The officers waiting to receive the ship had to repair and clean it before they could move in. The first step was to restore the electrical equipment. There were three generators on the ship, none of which could be used. The first one was repaired, but it burned out again after two days, so they had to repair another one with a smaller horsepower and use it for power generation, slowly repairing the lighting circuits to drive the darkness out of the cabin so that other work could be carried out. Once the ship had lights, the second step was to solve the drinking water problem. The freshwater tank was unbearably polluted with oil. To make it clean and usable, the soldiers had to crawl into it through small holes to work. In the summer on the Tropic of Cancer, the hold was like a steamer. People inside were exposed to the heat and stuffiness, and almost one person fainted every ten minutes. The freshwater tank was cleaned and painted in this way before it could be used. Then the bedrooms and dining rooms were gradually repaired, solving the problem of living on the ship.</p>
<p>However, when the engines could not work, the "Achilles" was still unable to move. It had two main engines on the left and right, with no records of their past history, but the extent of their wear and tear told people that they had both exceeded the time limit for replacement. The contractor only replaced some of the necessary parts of the right main engine that could not move. The left main engine was damaged during the initial test run and needed to be repaired. The engine is what a ship relies on to move. The "Achilles" only had a 60-plus rib frame, which could not be considered very strong, and its own machinery repair equipment was relatively heavy. To make it safely cross the ocean and return to the motherland, it was even more important not to neglect the performance of the engine. Therefore, this most important repair work was not completed until half a year later, when it sailed away from Pearl Harbor.</p>
<p>After Renovation, Re-Equipping</p>
<p>In addition to the repair of the hold equipment and the power unit, there was also various renovation work. All the accumulated rust in various parts and the superficial paint purchased with money had to be knocked off again and repainted several times. Every bed, every chair, every table had to be re-fitted. Medical equipment needed to be greatly replenished; the machinery repair equipment materials had to be reorganized and purchased. As for the ship's defense equipment, it had been completely dismantled when the "Achilles" was decided to be "retired." Only one of the original twelve 40-caliber anti-aircraft machine guns remained, a circle of the gun mount, and some old traces of installation were found on the deck for the other twelve 20 mm caliber anti-aircraft machine guns. The four half-inch caliber guns were also missing. The asbestos equipment in the two ammunition depots was completely gone. After negotiations and repairs, the ammunition depots were repaired, the parts were fitted, but only less than half of the original weapons were equipped. The 40 mm caliber anti-aircraft machine guns were refused to be equipped, and only six of the twelve 20 mm caliber anti-aircraft machine guns were installed due to the position of the guns. Two half-inch caliber guns were installed, so in total, there was defense equipment.</p>
<p>The "Achilles" is a repair ship, but it itself had to undergo such extensive repairs. This seemed like an incredibly foolish thing from the American perspective, but after more than four months, this repaired repair ship finally came back to life. On November 5, the ship receiving officers formally took it over from the contractor and the US Navy Department, named it "Xing'an," and on November 7, it moved. Under the astonished eyes of thousands of people, this American ship that had been regarded as scrap iron and "scrapped," flying the beautiful flag of the Chinese Navy, roared and left New Orleans Harbor, heading for the motherland.</p>
<p>The restoration work of the Xing'an was difficult. The four months of hard work on the Tropic of Cancer was a severe test for the 99 officers and soldiers receiving the ship. This kind of memory is like a nightmare. Captain Xu was not very willing to mention those difficulties, especially those man-made difficulties, but he would not forget their hard work. At the press conference, he gave the example of repairing the freshwater tank. In the officer's cabin, he pointed to the wall panel and said:</p>
<p>"Look! Like this, we painted it five times."</p>

<h3>The Southwest Lifeline: A Record of the Construction Exploration of the Xiang-Gui-Qian Railway, Duzhu Section (Part 2)</h3>
<p>The neighboring Bangshui No. 1 and No. 2 tunnels, with a total pilot tunnel length of 313 meters, were excavated on April 12th of last year. Because the stone is hard, protection is easy, and all widening and bottoming work is progressing faster. However, between Bangshui and Dalishu, mountains pile up, rising and falling. Where the railway line passes, it penetrates mountains and crosses valleys. Although it is only five and a half kilometers, the project is extremely difficult. There are a total of eight large and small tunnels and five large and small bridges. The earthwork construction has been poorly managed by migrant workers in the past, and the local county government has not yet assisted in the construction. It is said that this will be handled by special workers, and there is no major obstacle.</p>
<p>At 1:30, the jeep traveled on the material transportation road on the hillside. At around 2:00, it arrived at the Dalishu Bridge. The bridge spans the Dalishu River, which is the boundary between Majiang and Guiding counties. The railway slowly travels from the opposite bank of the river to the Dalishu Bridge, crosses the river, and then slowly extends to the Dalishu Station, forming a veritable electric light bulb-shaped curved line. Because the construction workers had no accommodation, the Dalishu Station was completed ahead of schedule last winter. The reporters were the first batch of passengers at the station, enjoying lunch there. The bridge construction site is about two kilometers away from the station. The bridge is 246 meters long, with nine spans and eleven piers. The highest pier reaches 35 meters, with a clear span of 20 meters. The bridge foundations range in depth from 11 meters to 6 or 7 meters. It is a large reinforced concrete arch bridge, ranking first among the bridges in the Duzhu section.</p>
<p>And it is the only large arch bridge on the South China Railway. The bridge foundations have all been completed, and the pier masonry is in progress. There are more than a hundred workers transporting material stone from the mountains five kilometers away. The contractor is the United Engineering Factory, a rising star in the engineering factory world. They have built a 300-meter-long stone transport chute on the mountainside, using the steel rails of a light railway inclined plane to save engineering costs. This is the only comical thing among the various tunnel and bridge projects in the Duzhu section. Because the Dalishu River is located between the mountains, there are flash floods, and the project is often hindered. The factory is specially equipped with four water pumps to take charge of drainage work, so the bridge construction is progressing smoothly. Since construction began more than fourteen months ago, the total project cost is nearly 30 billion yuan based on current values, and only about 20% of the bridge construction has been completed. If funds cannot be supplied on time, the project will be stalled. This bridge is of great importance to the entire section of the project, and all parties concerned are deeply worried.</p>
<p>At 5:00 PM that afternoon, the reporter group left Dalishu and returned to the material transportation road, continuing south towards Machangping at the 98-kilometer mark of the Qian-Gui Highway. Due to a jeep malfunction, we arrived at Machangping late at night around 10:00 PM and stayed overnight.</p>
<p>At 8:00 AM on the 13th, we left Machangping and arrived at Mapo, 10 kilometers away from Duyun, at 10:30 AM. Chief Engineer Xu Xuemao of the First General Section, Director Yao Yingzun of the Tunnel Construction Office, Director Zhao Jialiang of the Shibanhe Bridge Construction Office of the Third General Section, and many engineers had gathered at the Mapo Tunnel Construction Office the day before to welcome us, which was deeply appreciated. The Tunnel Construction Office rented a clean and refreshing farmhouse in a village of peach blossoms and white plum blossoms, with fallen petals filling the eyes with spring. After a short rest, we had lunch, and then Chief Engineer Xu accompanied us to visit the Qiaotoupou, Mapo bridges, and Mapo No. 1, 2, and 3 tunnels. The construction area of this section belongs to the First General Section, and the entire project is progressing quite fast. The entire section is 45 kilometers long, including ten tunnels, more than 1,000 meters long, and seven bridges, 604 meters long. The factories that have been contracted account for 25%. Other small bridges and culverts, about ten kilometers long, began construction at the end of 1946 and have now been largely completed.</p>

<p>[Our Wuxi Correspondent, 26th] Lu Boxu, the head of the 32nd Bao in Daqiangmen Town, Wuxi County, and others, raised funds last winter to establish Jianhua Primary School, using the Xingling Temple near the Bao as the school building. There were more than 60 students, and Fan Zhenmin was hired as the principal. At 2 p.m. on the 24th of this month, while Fan was in class, Zou Futai, a director of a neighboring school, colluded with local bullies Zou Fubao, Lu Shuijin, and about twenty or thirty others, carrying "Fragrant Brand" incense, under the pretext of burning incense at the temple. They rushed into the school, coercing Principal Fan Zhenmin to quickly move the "Hua Tuo Master" and "Lu Tou" deity statues that had been moved away back to their original locations. The principal, seeing the fierce situation, took the opportunity to escape. The thugs shouted and started smashing things. Teaching equipment and books flew everywhere, smashed to pieces. They also tore the national flag and the portrait of the Founding Father of the Republic and threw them on the ground, then dispersed in a rush. After this incident, all the students and their parents went to the county government in the city on the 25th to petition, demanding the arrest of the rioters and bringing them to justice.</p>
<p>Near Mapo</p>
<p>Qingtaipo is the starting point of the Duzhu section, extending to Wendechang for about ten kilometers. Since both Mapo and Wendechang are rich in coal mines, which are used to supply coal for trains running south of Duyun that have been restored to operation, the focus of construction for the entire section is on all the tunnel and bridge work within these ten kilometers. In terms of this section of the project, more than 80 percent has already been completed. If funding and materials are available, tracks can be laid and traffic opened for military use in two months.</p>
<p>Reporters first visited the Qiaotoupu Bridge in Mapo. The bridge is 145 meters long, with seven piers and five spans, each with a span of ten meters. It is a reinforced concrete T-beam bridge. The bridge foundations and piers have all been completed, and only about 40 percent of the work remains. The contractor is Yuqing Engineering Factory, which is famous for constructing many large railway projects in Northeast and North China. The site manager, Mr. Dong, specially displayed models of various large and small projects undertaken to give reporters a glimpse of the whole picture. Next, we visited the Mapo Bridge, which is 74 meters long, with five piers and three spans, each with a span of ten meters. It is also a reinforced concrete T-beam bridge, and also a large bridge where railway and highway intersect. 70 percent of the project has been completed. We then visited the Mapo No. 1 Tunnel, which is 90 meters long. The pilot tunnel has been fully excavated, and more than a hundred workers are working hard to deepen it. Unfortunately, the rock quality at the eastern end is poor, and collapses often occur. They are currently using a winch crane to transport stone materials and construct stone arch linings to ensure the safety of the project in the future. The nearby Mapo No. 2 Tunnel has a pilot tunnel 150 meters long, and the breakthrough was even earlier, but the geological conditions are similar to No. 1, and collapses also often occur. They are currently clearing and adding stone arches to provide protection. Mapo No. 3 Tunnel was the last place the reporters visited on this tour of the Duzhu section project. The tunnel is 90 meters long. Because the rock quality is hard, construction started earlier and has been fully completed. All the work of expanding and deepening, drainage ditches on both sides, and refuge caves have been cleaned up and are impressive. Earth retaining walls of 30 meters have been built at both ends, the workmanship is solid, and the materials are reliable, adding a lot of scenery to the surrounding water and mountain views.</p>
<p>After the visit, it was already dusk, so we drove to Duyun and stayed at the First Section Office. After dinner,</p>
<p>we toured Duyun City and the railway station. The city is prosperous, and the streets are clean. The long embankment near the railway station is brightly lit even late at night, and there are many travelers, which is enough to prove that the industrial and commercial economy of places with trains is particularly developed. A mixed train departs from Duyun to Dushan and Nandan every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, and it takes about fourteen hours to reach Nandan North Station. Trains depart from Nandan to Duyun every Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday. Passenger and freight transport in this section is very frequent, probably because of the prosperity of southern Guizhou and the abundance of fine tobacco.</p>
<p>The reporters returned to Guiyang from Duyun on the 14th, recalling the various situations of the entire Duzhu section project visited in the past three days, and feeling very excited. Since the victory, there have been frequent alarms of war throughout the north and south of the Yangtze River. In recent years, the communist bandits have been particularly rampant. Only our southwest corner, especially Guizhou, has been able to provide peace and security, allowing us to devote ourselves to construction and preserve the vitality of the country. This is a great opportunity. The Duzhu section is the last section of the southwestern artery railway under construction in our country. At this time of national difficulty, empty treasury, inconvenient transportation, and skyrocketing prices, it is possible to have all the employees and workers adhere to the spirit of hard work and prioritize the project, which is no less than a unique treasure of our country. It is hoped that the government authorities will make good use of it, allocate the necessary funds as soon as possible, and raise and transport the necessary materials, so that this hundred-li and ninety-li railway project can be completed as soon as possible. This is not only what the people of the southwestern provinces are eagerly awaiting, but also the effort that the country and the nation should make in the current international situation of changing winds and turbulent waves.

<h3>General Chennault on American Policy Toward China, Copyrighted by Scripps-Howard Newspaper Alliance</h3>
<p>— Translated by Our Editorial Department</p>
<p>(1) The Inappropriateness of China Policy</p>
<p>Today, the six hundred million people of China and the United States are directly affected by the inappropriateness of American policy toward China over the past ten years.</p>
<p>Unless a miracle occurs in which the United States can at the last minute truly understand the actual situation, show reasonable sympathy for China and provide active assistance, plus a miracle in which China can at the last minute show courage and composure, then there are only two unfortunate alternatives: either causing the disaster of World War III, or causing the even greater disaster of the whole world surrendering to a global totalitarian system.</p>
<p>Whichever of these happens, the free people of the whole world will bear the tragic legacy of American procrastination. It would be a great irony that we Americans would have to fight to maintain our interests and freedom because we took the wrong path, or would have to shamefully entrust our interests and freedom to others.</p>
<p>In these essays, I want to reveal some details of this American maladministration. I want to say who should be held responsible for this mismanagement and why.</p>
<p>I will state names, dates and places. Some of the material I will reveal is still secret, much of it buried in the files of the War Department, the State Department and the White House.</p>
<p>Some of it is not comfortable to read. From the standpoint of the nation, it is not convenient to admit that we have treated a friendly people who trusted us in an unfair way.</p>
<p>It is not convenient for us to admit that we have failed to keep our promises to an ally.</p>
<p>It is not convenient for us to admit that we sold out Chinese territory in order to get the Soviet Union to participate in the war against Japan, and we did not obtain China's permission beforehand.</p>
<p>It is an uncomfortable thing to reveal that we gave the most valuable land in China to the Communists and did not seek any compensation for China.</p>
<p>I went to China in 1932 and have spent almost all of my time there since then. I organized and led the "Flying Tigers". I know all the senior American commanders in the Far East well, and I served with them when the war came. As the director of the Fourteenth Air Force, I knew the baseness of American policy toward China deeply. During the war, I saw how it worked. Now, I am in China, witnessing the unfortunate consequences of this policy today.</p>
<p>In those dark days in Chongqing, I noticed that Chairman Chiang united his country, which was trapped in poverty, and repeatedly called on his ragged army to resist the brutal Japanese offensive.</p>
<p>Chiang Kai-shek's battle was the most inspiring example of heroic leadership under extremely unfavorable circumstances.</p>
<p>Even as he was making this great effort, some American allies repeatedly stabbed him in the back. I feel ashamed to mention this.</p>
<p>For example, I was present when General Stilwell, the commander of the American forces in the China theater at the time, attacked Chairman Chiang in front of President Roosevelt and Prime Minister Churchill. I will describe this and other things.</p>
<p>In short, American policy toward China and the activities of some American officials in China do not constitute a beautiful picture. But it is very important for the American people to know the background of the failure of American policy toward China. They may pay for this inappropriate policy with the blood of their descendants.</p>
<p>He does not want to whitewash the crimes committed by the central government in its relations with the United States. The Chinese government has raised many accusations on many things from American critics. I can't add anything more. But what I say may help put this criticism in its proper place, so that it can be viewed properly.</p>
<p>From a narrow point of view, the failure of Sino-American relations, which I believe the current situation is clear evidence of this failure, is mainly due to the difficulty in reconciling two different cultures, because each culture has its deep-rooted advantages and disadvantages that sometimes cannot accommodate other cultures.</p>
<p>But in addition to this conceivable limitation, there have been unforgivable failures on the part of those who implement American policy, which can only occur under circumstances of negligence, prejudice, shortsightedness, inaccurate judgment, and (I must add this, and I feel quite ashamed) a certain tendency to sow discord.</p>
<p>In these memories, I hope to outline some of the contours of American-Chinese relations in the past decade. I hope that in this way I can help other Americans understand the background of the many difficulties in our friendly cooperation with the Chinese National Government.</p>
<p>A fundamental question must be answered, and that is: after the United States maintained the traditional principle of opening the door to China at the cost of the war against Japan, how could it tolerate and even help Soviet communist forces replace the Japanese imperialism that had been crushed in China?</p>
<p>Part of the answer lies in a historical fact, and that is that we did not truly uphold the Open Door policy in China until Japan launched its attack on Pearl Harbor. This was four years after Japan launched its conquest of China and ten years after Japan seized Manchuria.</p>
<p>This simple and solemn historical fact should give Americans a lesson: it is never possible to compromise with aggressors at a low price.</p>
<p>In order to find other reasons for our fickle attitude toward the influence of Soviet communists in China, we must explore some aspects of the relationship between Americans and the Chinese government, which has recently been recognized by the public, and the Chinese Communist puppets.</p>
<p>This is simply the work of a historian. But the history of our time is so fluid that we cannot wait for it to condense before studying its nature. If we have to wait for the next generation of researchers to piece together this sad record, it may be too late.</p>
<p>The inappropriateness of our country's policy toward China in the past decade began in 1937, when Japan launched its conquest of China. From the outset, this action of Japan was against the great interests of the United States and world peace. We did nothing, or almost nothing.</p>
<p>What Japan did in Manchuria in 1931 is similar to what we see today in the Soviet support of the Chinese Communists. This does not need to be proven, because in fact these puppets are armed with weapons seized by the Soviet army from the Japanese Kwantung Army, and the Soviet army's invasion of Northeast China was at the invitation of the United States in Yalta.</p>
<p>What Japan did in China in 1937 may soon happen again—this time not a Soviet invasion in the Japanese style, but through the puppet forces of Eastern Communists. The plan is the same, and from a military strategic point of view, it is even larger than Japan's ultimately failed "Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere."</p>
<h3>Beware of "Schistosomiasis", Warning Signs Erected in Suzhou</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent, Suzhou, 26th] The roving work team of the Suzhou Provincial Institute for the Prevention and Control of Endemic Diseases, previously discovered that the Japanese "Schistosoma japonicum" was spreading and multiplying in the rivers of Suzhou, and stayed in this county for detailed investigation.

<h3>Yellow River Flowing Downward</h3>

<p>[Our Correspondent, Zhenjiang, 26th] Chairman Wang of the Jiangsu Provincial Government recently reported that according to a telegram from Kaifeng on March 22nd, the Yellow River is flowing downward from Houji directly to Jia Zhuang (located in Heze County, Shandong Province). Although it was not a dangerous project in the past, the embankment is thin. In the event of a breach, the situation will be exactly the same as the Dongzhuang breach in 1935. The counties of Heze, Juye, Jinxiang, and Yutai in Shandong, and the counties of Feng, Pei, Pi, Tongshan, Su, and Shuyang in Jiangsu will be submerged. The various counties of Xuhai in northern Jiangsu are even more frightened by the news, as the people cannot bear any more disasters after the floods. They will send separate telegrams to the Ministry of Water Resources, the Executive Yuan, and the Shandong Provincial Government to strictly prevent and control the situation.</p>

<h3>Northeastern Students Repeatedly Rejected by Peiping Universities</h3>
<p>[Our Peiping Correspondent, 27th] Northeastern University students stranded in Peiping told reporters that most universities in Peiping refuse to allow students from Northeastern universities to audit classes. Although the Ministry of Education has issued a clear order, most schools politely refuse, citing insufficient funding or differences in academic departments. In another week, one-third of the semester will have passed, and hope will be lost. Currently, only the Railway College allows students from the Northeastern University preparatory class to audit classes. Students from Changbai Teachers College may be able to audit classes at the Teachers College. The Nankai College of Arts and Law in Tianjin may be able to accommodate a few students, but other schools are still considering.</p>

<h3>Huang Zengyue Leaves Shenyang to Report Back to Nanjing</h3>
<p>Students at Private Zheng University Survive on Thin Gruel</p>
<p>[Our Shenyang Correspondent, 27th] Ministry of Education Inspector Huang Zengyue left Shenyang for Peiping yesterday to report back to Nanjing. Before his departure, he said: The educational circles in the Northeast are poor but orderly, and their ability to work diligently in the most difficult circumstances is deeply touching. He added that the central government has decided to strengthen education policies in the Northeast to rescue refugee students. Reportedly, Mr. Huang has collected data on the actual difficulties faced by various national universities in the Northeast for the Ministry of Education to use as a reference for emergency preparations.</p>
<p>[Our Fanyang Correspondent, 27th] The private Zheng University was originally scheduled to close this month but later decided to continue operating. However, due to a lack of funding, whether it can continue to operate is questionable. More than five hundred students at the school are living on thin gruel every day, and many are starving and sick, a truly miserable situation. The school's student union has launched a self-help campaign and will stage a drama, "Sunken Abyss," on the 28th to raise funds.</p>

<h3>West China University, a Center of Medical Education by the Wanli Bridge in Chengdu</h3>
<p>[Our Chengdu Correspondent, 23rd] Leaving Chengdu's southern suburbs and crossing the famous "Wanli Bridge," a few hundred steps to the left will reveal lush greenery, tree-lined paths, and towering buildings - this is the "wartime university city" of Huaxiba. Now that the five missionary universities have returned east, only the old owner, West China University, remains. However, because of the nationwide fame of the dental school at West China University, Huaxiba is still a center of medical education in the Southwest today.</p>
<p>More than Forty Years of History</p>
<p>West China University is one of the oldest missionary universities, founded in 1910 (the third year of the reign of Emperor Xuantong of the Qing Dynasty). Initially, it had three departments of arts, sciences, and education. In 1913, it established a medical school, and in 1914, it added a dental school. In 1933, the university was divided into three colleges: arts, sciences, and medicine. During the more than thirty years since the establishment of the dental school, successive directors such as Dr. Lindsay and Dr. Qizhendao, Dr. Tom Bosen, and Dr. Mores were all internationally renowned dental authorities. Thanks to their careful planning and diligent cultivation, the progress of the West China University Dental School progressed rapidly, gaining international acclaim and earning the reputation as the leading dental authority in East Asia. Over the past thirty years, graduates have spread throughout the country, writing a glorious page in the history of Chinese medical education.</p>
<p>Currently, the person in charge of the medical school is Dr. Cao Zhongliang, and the person in charge of the dental school is Dr. Lindsay. There are 273 students enrolled in the medical school and 150 in the dental school, all on a seven-year program. The first year is pre-med, and the second and third years have the same curriculum, including basic courses such as histology and embryology. Students begin specializing in the fifth year, with the last two years focusing on clinical practice. After completing the seven-year course and undergoing a long period of clinical practice, they can graduate. Because the school implements scientific and rigorous training, the performance of West China University medical and dental graduates is well-known throughout the country.</p>
<p>Father of Chinese Dentistry</p>
<p>Dr. Lindsay, the 65-year-old internationally renowned dental authority and Dean of the Dental School, has served at West China University for over thirty years. He has successively planned the establishment of dental schools at Central University and other universities, with students all over the world, earning the nickname "Father of Chinese Dentistry." The dental school includes departments such as restoration and oral medicine, which study filling, inlay, and medical techniques, as well as courses in pathology and histology. The specimen collection is particularly rich, with everything from the head bones of primitive creatures such as salamanders to the head bones of apes, rabbits, and various humans being collected. Education is entirely based on the American system, paying special attention to the relationship between dentistry and general medicine, emphasizing general medical training.</p>
<p>The medical school has been established for thirty years and boasts the most complete equipment and longest history in the Southwest. The general equipment is very complete, with a deep X-ray machine for the specialized treatment of tumors. Surgery is unique in both internal and external medicine. The school also has an anatomy lab with six dissection tables. The corpses are all preserved, and each corpse is dissected by eight students, dissecting the skin, muscles, and internal organs layer by layer. Dean Cao Zhongliang is an internal medicine expert, and the internal and external medicine departments of West China University Medical School are well-known among medical schools in China.</p>
<p>Future Development Paths West China University Dental School's contributions to society include teaching hospitals, including a university hospital, oral hospital, leprosy hospital, tuberculosis sanatorium, mental hospital, and eye, ear, nose, and throat hospital, which are the most prestigious large hospitals in the Southwest. In addition, the medical school library has a rich collection, with over 6,000 rare Chinese and Western medical books and over 70 medical magazines.</p>
<p>As for the future development path of the West China University Dental School, Dean Cao told reporters: China's medical progress is almost on par with Europe and the United States. In the future, to promote the development of Chinese medicine, we should first implement a public health system, so that doctors can become specialized technicians to strive for the progress of medical technology. Vice Dean Luo Zonglai, one of the persons in charge of the dental department, believes that we should focus on discovering the relationship between dentistry and general medicine to prevent various diseases caused by the "transmission of lesions" from teeth and oral cavity. The spirit of the West China University Dental School is to encourage graduates to join hospitals or medical education institutions to seek research and improvement, and then seek the progress and development of China's new medicine from research and improvement.

<p>The agility and stability of the guest player Shifuller, and the elusiveness of Ateson, often made the Da Gong team panic. The two can be described as dangerous elements in Da Gong's eyes last night. Looking at the team's playing style, it is very organized. In all fairness, their strength is no less than that of Da Gong or Hualian. And the health of the physique and the calmness of the battle, if they can play a few more times in the city sports hall, and become familiar with the arena, they should be watched with wide eyes.

<p>In the five minutes of overtime, Stan made two free throws and Wenhua made up for his mistakes, tying the score again at 61. Shifuller's goal almost became a fatal injury to Da Gong. Wenhua scored again, which can be described as escaping from death. From then on, Da Gong's prestige was greatly enhanced and they scored three consecutive goals. Stan scored a basket and Da Gong won with a score of 69 to 65.</p>

<h3>Credit Loosening, Guest Dealers Actively Buying, Yarn and Cloth Prices Soaring Violently Again</h3>
<p>Yesterday's cotton yarn market conditions were due to the easing of credit among peers, and it was reported that Shaanxi cotton had skyrocketed again, rising wildly from 5.8 million per load to 8 million. Guest dealers from Tianjin, Guangdong, Hankou and other places were strong in purchasing, and the buying trend expanded in this street. Therefore, all the yarns at the beginning of the opening were quoted at high prices. 42 count Blue Phoenix fine yarn was near the 100 million yuan mark. Later, it was heard that cloth prices were rising, and people's hearts were even stronger, and the market saw soaring prices, and the market went up all the way to 207.7 million yuan at the close. Compared with the previous day, it rose by another 17 million yuan. Shuiyue and Jincheng also rose by 14.5 million. 21 count Double Horse yarn opened at 130 million, and because the cloth market was popular, the dealers on the table raised the price to 137 million. Near the close, the floating dealers took profits and sold, and returned to a low of 134 million at the close. Up 6 million. The remaining 20 count yarns generally rose by about 10%. 16 count and 10 count coarse yarns were mostly purchased by guest dealers, and mostly soared by about 15%.</p>
<p>Yesterday's cotton cloth market conditions were due to the easing of money among peers and the help of rising yarn prices. The market was unanimously optimistic. In addition, there was active hot money. Shanxi dealers continued to purchase, and the replenishment on this street was also strong. Cloth houses mostly purchased more and sold less, and the buying sentiment turned strong. Cloth prices rose again. 12-pound Dragon Head fine cloth jumped by 290,000 yuan at the beginning of the opening, to 4.22 million yuan, and there was a lack of supply. It went all the way up to 4.4 million yuan at the close, and there were still few sales, a sharp rise of 420,000 yuan compared to the previous day. It was found that the price outside the market rose by 230,000 yuan, but the final transaction was for the opening dealer to ship, at 4.6 million yuan, and there was competition for purchase. The prices of other fine cloths such as Five Fortune Colored Balls also rebounded from 200,000 to 450,000 yuan. The prices of serge and Zhigong also rebounded by about 450,000 due to the scarcity of goods. In addition, the prices of fine twill coarse cloth and colored cloth Shilin cloth were also popular, and transactions were booming.</p>
<p>Another News: The price of Longtou fine cloth supplied by Fangjian Company is 4.24 million yuan, and the purchase order is surcharged by 300,000 yuan, and the supply is less than the demand.</p>
<h3>China Trust Bureau Decides to Distribute Artificial Silk Prices Next Week</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] China Trust Bureau decided yesterday that the distribution price of artificial silk next week will be as follows: (1) Toyo 1A 17.2 million yuan, 2A 16.78 million yuan, 3A 16.27 million yuan, 4A 15.4 million yuan. (2) Tianjin Bridge 1A 17.04 million yuan, 2A 16.7 million yuan, 3A 16.19 million yuan, 4A 15.34 million yuan. (3) Others: 1A 16.98 million yuan, 2A 16.64 million yuan, 3A 16.14 million yuan, 4A 15.28 million yuan.</p>
<h3>Wool Market Turns Popular</h3>
<p>Woolen fabrics and wools were once considered expensive, and sales should have been good, but they suddenly stopped temporarily, forming a fact of mutual rejection and few transactions. Recently, there has been gradual activity. Local dealers have a bit of interest in Melius, French cashmere, Van Erding, Watani, serge and light-colored tweed. Spring sales are in season, and the production of Chinese and Western clothing has been launched. In addition, the prices of all goods are expensive, and the prices of each type of woolen fabric have therefore continued to rise.</p>
<h3>Internal Exchange Rate Revised</h3>

<h3>In the Midst of Market Holiday Announcements, Rice and Grains See Slight Increase</h3>
<p>Due to the market holiday next Monday for the Revolutionary Martyrs Memorial, the rice market, together with Sunday, will be closed for two days. There are many people in this street who are adding to their stocks in advance. Moreover, credit is slightly looser, and cargo owners are reluctant to sell because they have to wait until next Tuesday to deliver the goods after unloading them. For this reason, prices have seen a slight increase. The white japonica rice in the North City market is 3.7 million yuan, and thin rice and early rice have increased by 100,000 yuan. The South City market has increased slightly by 50,000 yuan. The Civil Food Allocation Council sold a total of 935 stone of thin rice, early rice, and white japonica rice in the South City market. The North City market sold 2,190 stone of white japonica rice at a price of 3.6 million yuan. The goods arriving yesterday were still scarce, with 2,440 stone in the South City market and 1,929 stone in the North City market.</p>
<p>Flour</p>
<p>With credit slightly looser, cargo owners no longer suppressed prices to sell. Also, due to the two-day holiday and the need to wait until next Tuesday for delivery, cargo owners were reluctant to sell. With buyers seeking goods, prices were strongly raised, and prices rose sharply. The opening price of old car flour was 1.5 million yuan, but the market later returned slightly to 1.49 million yuan. The closing price of Bingchuan was 1.485 million yuan, an increase of 40,000 and 60,000 yuan respectively. Red Bee and Jiancheng were especially favored by retail investors, and finally rose by 80,000 yuan. The delivered price of Xiong brand flour rose by 50,000 yuan each. Bran followed suit with an increase of 45,000 yuan. The factory price of wheat was reduced to 2.05 million yuan.</p>
<p>Miscellaneous Grains</p>
<p>Due to the two-day closure, this street absorbed more goods. With the tight credit situation slightly suppressed, cargo owners no longer sold lightly. Tianjin Mung beans finally increased by 50,000 yuan. Although the absorption of corn by Qingbang was not very poor, it rose slightly by 560,000 yuan. Red grains were scarce, and mung beans and selected green beans were sluggish. Sesame was slightly firm. Guangzhou dealers had a renewed appetite for raw peanuts, rising by 300,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Edible Oil</p>
<p>There was a lot of additional purchases in this street. With active sales, prices soared. The factory's opening sales increased again, and the early market was even more popular. Later, due to the high sales of retail investors, it fell slightly. Dayou soybean oil ranged from 7.65 to 7.6 million yuan. The closing prices of other soybean oils were all in the range of 7.58 million yuan, an increase of about 200,000 yuan each. The trading of raw oil was also active. Qingdao Jiton raw oil was 9.15 million yuan, also up 200,000 yuan. Raw sesame oil and rapeseed oil each rose by 200,000 yuan, and the market was slightly soft. Soybean cakes took the opportunity to rise, each rising by 450,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>Tea Prices are all at Peak</h3>
<p>Tea owners have not increased their stocks, and the production period for new goods is still waiting, so they are reluctant to part with the goods in their hands. Buyers are still in contact with each other from all sides, and because the market's money frequency is turning loose, they are not hesitant to move forward. However, the number of transactions is not large, and the market offers are all at a high peak. Looking ahead, there is fear that it will be difficult to meet its sharpness.</p>
<h3>Bureau of Standards Promotes Industrial Standardization</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] The Central Bureau of Standards of the Ministry of Economic Affairs has specially formulated an instruction manual and attached a standard classification catalog to promote national standards, and sent a letter to the Industrial and Commercial Guidance Office, which will distribute it to relevant trade associations and large factories across the country for reference and implementation. The bureau stated that industrial standardization is the basis for improving economic efficiency. All countries in the world are working hard to promote it. So far, the bureau has successively formulated and submitted for promulgation standards in accordance with legal procedures, which have accumulated to a certain extent. All general standards, as well as mechanical, electrical, automotive, ferrous metal, non-ferrous metal, chemical, agricultural, and ceramic standards, have been stipulated. It is understood that the bureau has set a classification catalog, totaling nine categories, namely general standards, mechanical industry standards, electrical industry standards, automobile and aviation industry standards, iron industry standards, non-ferrous metal industry standards, chemical industry standards, agricultural standards, and ceramic standards.</p>
<h3>Although There is Stimulation Outside the Industry, China Stocks are Insufficient</h3>
<p>Although China stocks were repeatedly invigorated by the rise of the industry in the middle of yesterday, they were helplessly blocked by the oversupply of floating stocks. New buyers did not come, and the stamina was exhausted. Near noon, they finally fell out of support amid the cutting of more positions.</p>
<p>The morning was stable. Yong yarn entered the market at a price of 1,860 yuan, falling back to 1,777 yuan and 1,843 yuan. It then rose to 1,805 yuan and 1,885 yuan. However, with the strengthening of external stimulation, people's hearts were still excited, rising to a high price of 1,830 yuan and 1,905 yuan. Due to high supply, it dropped to 1,788 yuan and 1,855 yuan. There was still stimulation outside the industry. The last time it rebounded to 1,828 yuan and 1,900 yuan, it deteriorated thereafter, and the noon closing was forced down to 1,790 yuan and 1,853 yuan. Compared with the previous closing, Rongfeng rose slightly in terms of delivery shares, while Zhongfa Xinhua Xinyi fell by half, and Zhabei Xinyi Yonggong Zhongsi Heng were almost flat, while the rest fell slightly. Except for Qinxing, which was flat, all the delivery shares fell slightly. Various unlisted stocks outside the market fell slightly.</p>
<p>Government Bonds</p>
<p>Yesterday was stable. Transactions amounted to about 3 million. Tongbing opened at 95,000 in the morning, rising from 94,000 to 100,200, and then stabilized slightly. Compared with the previous closing, types A, B, and D each rose by 2,000 yuan, type C rose by 4,000 yuan, and type E rose by 3,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Foreign Stocks</p>
<p>Yesterday was mixed. Retail investors adorned it, and transactions were limited. Yi yarn agriculture opened at 1.86 million, the high price did not exceed 1.88 million, and the low price Zhu broke 1.85 million. The closing was slightly flat, compared with the previous closing, Yi yarn and British Union rose slightly, Huidong Industry Steel fell slightly, Yi Beer rose by half, rubber stock and Yeguang paper version telephone were flat.</p>
<h3>Dispatch of Funds by Banks and Bureaus: Excessively Loose Monetary Conditions</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the city's monetary conditions had already shifted from stable to excessively loose. In the afternoon, after news circulated that national banks and bureaus were dispatching large amounts of funds during the clearing of checks and notes by the money industry, funds were readily available, and the informal market interest rates gradually declined. The following details the inflows and outflows of various banks and bureaus during yesterday's check and note clearing, based on inquiries: The total dispatch of funds from the four major banks, two joint banks, and one treasury amounted to 103 billion. Specifically, the Central Bank received 20 billion, the Bank of China dispatched 53 billion, the Bank of Communications dispatched 80.3 billion, the Farmers Bank dispatched 31.1 billion, the Central Trust Bureau dispatched 10.8 billion, the Postal Remittances Bureau dispatched 11.6 billion, the Central Cooperative Treasury received 1.6 billion, and the foreign banks in the city collectively received 91 billion.</p>
<h3>Fluctuations in Edible Oil Prices Not Due to Hoarding</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] The city's Edible Oil Trade Association has explained the reasons for fluctuations in edible oil prices, clarifying that there is no hoarding. They stated that the recent price fluctuations are due to: (1) It is currently the peak season for soap production, and sales are expected to be robust. Those with capital are actively purchasing and storing oil. Additionally, soap factories are allocated only slightly over 3 million yuan in goods, but the market price has soared to over 5 million yuan. The reason for this discrepancy is quite evident. (2) Since the post-war recovery, there has been a shortage of edible oils worldwide. Domestically, the expansion of the war has disrupted transportation, making procurement difficult. (3) The price of tallow is not as high as 16 million per dan (unit of weight), as claimed by the Soap Industry Association. The Soap Industry Association should be required to submit purchase transaction documents for public judgment. (4) The Dayuan Company recently attempted to purchase 400 barrels of edible oil from Chongqing, but the authorities have prohibited their shipment. Negotiations are currently underway.</p>

<h3>The Current State of Copper Product Production and Sales in the Shanghai Area</h3>
<p>— Qin Hao</p>
<p>(1) Introduction</p>
<p>Shanghai is the largest city in China and the nerve center of the country's industry and commerce. The rise and fall of various industries significantly impacts the entire nation. To understand the overall state of a particular industry or trade in China, examining its situation in Shanghai is sufficient to gain a general understanding. The copper products industry is an important light industry with a relatively long history in China. Its main products are copper sheets, copper rods (commonly known as copper ingots), and copper wires, supplemented by various other components. Copper sheets are further divided into thick and thin types, with the thick ones commonly known as copper plates and the thin ones called copper sheets. Copper wires are distinguished as ordinary copper wires and enameled copper wires.</p>
<p>Currently, there are fewer than 500 factories in the Shanghai area that specialize in or produce copper products. Privately owned factories account for the vast majority, with only the Central Mint and the Central Electrical Equipment Factory under the Resources Committee being state-owned. However, both factories far surpass private factories in terms of equipment and productivity. Among the private copper products factories, they can be further divided into copper rolling mills, metal smelting factories, and hardware industrial factories. Due to limited capital, they are smaller in scale, and their organization and equipment are inevitably crude and simple, falling far short of their counterparts in foreign countries.</p>
<p>The production status and equipment of state-owned and private factories will be described in detail below:</p>
<p>(2) State-Owned Factories</p>
<p>A. Central Mint The Central Mint is located at No. 3 Hebei Road at the end of Jiangning Road and is vast in scale, occupying approximately 80 mu of land. Before the war, its main business was minting various coins. Later, when the government implemented a paper currency policy, the factory's business also changed, and it switched to refining various copper products to meet national defense needs. When the Anti-Japanese War broke out, the factory was ordered to relocate to Chongqing. However, due to the urgency, important machinery and equipment could not be moved. After Shanghai fell, the factory was occupied by the Japanese invaders, and most of its machinery was dismantled and removed, resulting in significant losses. Although it was restored after the victory, its interior had been completely transformed, making it difficult to restore its former appearance.</p>
<p>The factory's current equipment includes only three rolling mills (down from ten before the war) and ten smelting furnaces with a capacity of 2.5 cubic feet (down from forty before the war). It employs approximately 300 workers. In terms of production, it can cast about 3 to 4 tons of copper ingots and about half a ton of brass sheets per day. It is actively planning to increase production, intending to extend working hours from nine to twenty hours. It is estimated that it can then produce more than one ton of brass sheets and about 8 to 9 tons of copper ingots per day. In addition to the materials supplied by the Materials Supply Bureau, it also purchases old copper coins and electrolytic copper from the market to supplement its needs.</p>
<p>Currently, the factory uses kerosene as its main fuel for the smelting furnaces due to insufficient gas supply. The method involves storing kerosene in a tank about twelve feet above the ground, allowing it to automatically generate pressure. The kerosene is then sprayed out through nozzles, and with the aid of forced air, the kerosene is directly injected into the furnace hearth. The heat can raise the temperature of the crucible suspended in the furnace hearth to about 1300 degrees Celsius, melting the raw copper.</p>
<p>There are only three rolling mills currently. Copper sheets can be rolled to a thickness of 0.3 millimeters, but the width is quite limited, with a maximum of only seven inches. However, to meet market demand, it currently only rolls two types, four inches and six inches wide.</p>
<p>In addition, there are three annealing furnaces. Two use bituminous coal to generate heat for annealing copper products, while the other still uses kerosene to generate heat. Because the temperature is more even, the annealed copper products are of better quality.</p>
<p>The factory's brass sheets are made by mixing 65% electrolytic copper with 35% pure zinc and then smelting, forging, and rolling. There are many holes and cracks, so the copper sheets must be inspected and remelted in the furnace, which is quite cumbersome. The copper ingots it produces contain only 90% copper, with the remaining 10% being iron and sulfur. The presence of these impurities reduces the ductility of the copper products and increases their brittleness.</p>
<p>In terms of sales, copper sheets are more popular, and the main customers are small factories in the city, especially flashlight and pen factories. There are occasional shipments to Jiujiang, Nanchang, Bengbu, and other places for making foot warmers, copper hangers, washbasins, and other utensils. The sales of copper ingots are sluggish.</p>
<p>Overall, the factory's current situation is that its output is relatively small and there are not many styles due to limited equipment. Active improvements and expansion are needed. It is said that a rolling mill is currently stored in a former enemy factory in Yangshupu. The width of the roller reaches 24 inches. If it is used to roll copper sheets, it can roll to at least 22 inches wide. The factory is planning to find a way to use it. However, because the machine was originally used to roll lead sheets, the type of roller is different from that of a copper rolling mill. Whether it can be used is still a problem, and preliminary tests are currently underway. In addition, the factory sent personnel to Shenyang last summer to seek to receive the equipment of the local mint in Shenyang and transport it to Shanghai for use. Whether this has been realized is unknown.</p>
<p>B. Central Electrical Equipment Factory The Shanghai First Branch of the Central Electrical Equipment Factory is located at No. 826 Hejian Road, Yangshupu, occupying approximately 10 mu of land. During the Anti-Japanese War, it was originally operated by the Japanese. Initially, it only had a rolling mill, specializing in the casting of copper sheets and copper wires. Later, it was expanded to include a smelting mill and an electrolytic mill, planning to directly refine refined copper from crude copper to further cast copper sheets and copper wires. However, because the average copper content of the waste copper raw materials collected at that time was only about 85%, and the smelting method was not good, the copper ingots produced had a content of only about 95%, with much iron and other impurities contained within. It was not suitable for use as the anode copper for electrolysis because the purity of the electrolytic copper obtained could not reach 99%. Therefore, it was still under research and improvement at that time. Soon after, the overall victory arrived, and the factory was taken over by the Resources Committee. It made overall plans to transform the factory based on all its existing equipment and enlarged the reverberatory furnace (now capable of holding five tons of copper material). After more than a year of rectification, most of the factory's equipment has been perfected.</p>
<p>The factory's current equipment includes: one blast furnace, one reverberatory furnace, one boiler, sixty electrolytic cells, one annealing furnace, two rolling mills, and four large and small rolling mills for rolling copper wires.</p>
<p>In terms of production, the electrolysis chamber can produce about 1.5 tons of electrolytic copper per day. Some parts are used to draw copper wires. However, the electrolytic copper produced is not enough for its own use, and it must be purchased from other state-owned enterprises and manufacturers to supplement its needs.</p>
<p>The factory's copper smelting process is to first put the waste copper raw materials into the blast furnace. After they are melted and some impurities are removed, they become copper ingots with a purity of 95%. They are then put into the reverberatory furnace for hydrogenation reduction refining, resulting in anode copper with a content of 99%. This anode copper is then electrolytically refined in the electrolysis mill to become cathode electrolytic copper with a content of 99.95%. Finally, after annealing and other procedures, it is drawn into various thick and thin copper wires with a diameter of 3.1 mm to 0.8 mm to meet the needs of electrical engineering. Another part of the electrolytic copper with a poorer composition is sent to the Third Branch Factory to roll copper sheets. The thickness of the purple copper sheets it produces ranges from 0.18 inches to 0.25 inches, and the thickness of the brass sheets ranges from 0.005 inches to 0.05 inches. The width is 4 inches to 10 inches. In terms of length, the thin ones are about 3 feet or more, and the thick ones can reach up to 8 feet.</p>
<p>The quality and quantity of the various copper products produced by the factory are increasing day by day, so sales are very smooth. However, the scale still needs to be expanded because, in terms of the factory's existing equipment, it is still quite far from the general copper factories in Shenyang, Kunming, and other places.</p>
<p>(3) Private Factories</p>
<p>A. Copper Rolling Mills The copper rolling mills in Shanghai were originally members of the Copper and Tin Trade Association. Their main business was manufacturing copper sheets. Later, because the industry was purely a production business and belonged to the commercial association, which did not match the reality, it was reorganized in 1946 to establish the Shanghai Copper Rolling Industry Trade Association. The association is located on Chenghaiwei Road, and the person in charge is Mr. Yu Zhongnan.</p>
<p>During the Anti-Japanese War, the copper rolling mills were successively occupied by the Japanese army and manufactured various military supplies. The machinery and equipment of a few larger factories were dismantled and removed, resulting in significant losses. After the victory, the factory owners began to recover and resume operations.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the victory, the copper sheet industry experienced an unprecedented prosperous scene due to the urgent need for goods in the market and the inability to meet demand. Moreover, because raw materials were abundant and prices were low at the time, the ratio of raw material prices to finished product prices was about one to five. The profit margin was considerable. As a result, newly established copper rolling mills sprang up like mushrooms after rain, reaching a peak for a time. However, the good times did not last long. Since last summer, due to the impact of the economic downturn and the scarcity of raw materials and high prices, the profit margin of finished products has become thin, and sales have gradually become sluggish, so the entire copper rolling industry has once again fallen into a state of depression.

<h3>Overview of Yingkou</h3>
<p>Yingkou is located on the side of the Liao River. For more than a hundred years, the accumulation of mud on the banks has created a plain alluvial soil of the Liao River, hence its name as a "delta." In the early years of Daoguang, it was first named "Mogouying," and later renamed Yingkou. The trade of Niuzhuang, Chengtian, Zhuangtai, and other places in the upper reaches of the Liao River gradually shifted to this area. In 1858, according to the Treaty of Tianjin, a British consulate was established in Yingkou, and it gradually developed, becoming an important port for the export of agricultural products from the Liao River. Soybeans piled up like mountains, and oil mills stood in great numbers. Since the Russo-Japanese War, its position has gradually been taken by Dalian, so Yingkou's reputation has diminished compared to its former glory.</p>
<p>Yingkou has a population of approximately 200,000. The streets are tidy, and the riverbank is about two li long from east to west, with a vast area. It used to be one of the largest trading ports in Northeast China and the largest connecting line between the mainland's commercial economy. Water transportation is extremely convenient, and land transportation is the terminal of the Dashi branch line of the China Chang Railway, with roads extending in all directions. Goods are distributed and collected here. Exports include soybeans, sorghum, oil, soybean cakes, etc., and imports include medicinal materials, tea, bamboo cotton, pottery, grain, and other items.</p>
<p>After the victory, the National Army and the Communist bandits fought over the city several times, causing severe damage. After the hard work of the garrison, it has been restored to its former appearance.</p>

<h3>Tomb-Sweeping Day</h3>
<p>— Jingwen</p>
<p>The Western holiday of Easter is commonly called the foreign Tomb-Sweeping Day, while our Tomb-Sweeping Day is also called the grave-sweeping festival. These two holidays, although originating from two different folk traditions, both express humanity's joyful mood for the arrival of spring, and both express humanity's love for life.</p>
<p>From a religious perspective, Easter was originally a holiday with a somewhat sad meaning, because the page before Easter is the tragedy of Jesus being crucified. However, Easter, which has been passed down to this day, has mixed in many so-called pagan cultures from medieval European agricultural societies. For example, the colored egg that symbolizes Easter is because ancient European farmers believed that eggs laid on the spring equinox could be stored for years without spoiling. On Easter day, farmers brought many eggs to churches to ask the priest to bless them. In addition, in the minds of ancient farmers, the egg was God's masterpiece, symbolizing the sun—the spring sun—and also symbolizing the universe. The Easter eggs that are popular on the market today, although dyed in various colors, were originally red, meaning to represent the holy blood of Jesus.</p>
<p>Our Tomb-Sweeping Day—the grave-sweeping festival—also carries a somewhat sad meaning. For example, these days when you look out of the train windows at the many earthen graves with paper pennants fluttering on both sides, you can't help but be filled with many illusory musings. You may think that although you have entered another spring, you are also taking another step closer to the eternal winter. You will recall the voices and faces of your deceased relatives and friends and think that he or she has been lying in the lonely wilderness for many years, thus a feeling of sorrow surges in your heart.</p>
<p>I personally feel that the sad emotion of mankind is not only a noblest emotion, but also the most powerful cooling agent for the muddleheaded world. When you stand in front of the grave of your relatives and friends, facing the offerings of fresh flowers or incense, you cannot help but feel a moment of disillusionment with the noisy secular life. All concepts of fame and fortune have absolutely no room to stand in front of the grave. I even have such a ridiculous idea that if the political leaders and warmongers of all the hostile countries in the world were to discuss world issues at the tombs of unknown heroes in Paris, New York, Moscow, or other countries, I dare to believe that world peace would be achieved. Magnificent palace-style venues have always been the stage for politicians to engage in verbal battles behind the backs of the public and have never contributed to true world peace.</p>
<p>But whether it is the grave-sweeping festival or Easter, beyond their sad implications, they also contain a concept of humanity's love for life. The religious meaning of Easter certainly focuses on this point. Even our grave-sweeping festival, in addition to remembering ancestors and deceased relatives and friends, can also arouse in us who are still alive a sense of gratitude to the Creator. Especially for families with many descendants, when you see your children surrounding the graves of your ancestors, you will surely feel a kind of unspeakable comfort on behalf of those in the tomb. Your children may never have had the opportunity to be close to your previous generation of ancestors, and even facing the solemn cemetery in their young hearts, they may not feel anything special. However, you certainly know that in the two worlds of those inside and those outside the tomb, there is still a connection of eternal life, and you feel that life is particularly precious.</p>
<p>Although some people argue that the concept of family or clan is feudal thinking, in reality it is not. The feudal system is a social form of a certain economic system. Feudal society may produce clans, but there is no direct relationship with the concept of family. Although the family cannot exist apart from society, I believe that under any social system, as long as a person knows that he has parents, the idea of family will never disappear. People in primitive society may not have this concept, but today's world, no matter how it turns backward, will probably not return to primitive times, at least not in people's minds.</p>
<p>Grave-sweeping and resurrection seem to be exactly the opposite in terms of words, but they are the same in encouraging people to trace new life from the past. This is enough to prove that although the expressions of Eastern and Western cultures are different, the hearts of people around the world are the same.</p>
<h3>Mud Can Cure Diseases</h3>
<p>— Daoxian</p>
<p>The Czech Republic is a well-known exporting country, but in addition to glass, industrial products, etc., the Czech Republic also exports a large amount of mud every year. Of course, this is a very special kind of mud, limited to the mud in the famous "Piestany mud spring" area. It is said to have medical value and can cure rheumatism. Every year, it is packed in boxes and sent to hospitals and pharmacies in Australia, South America, Canada, and Palestine.</p>
<h3>The Greatness of the World</h3>
<p>— Le</p>
<p>The most prolific writer in the United States was Edward Stratemeyer (1862-1930) from Newark. He used more than a dozen different pen names to write cheap novels specifically for children. In the last thirty years of his life, he wrote as many as 800 of these novels, selling them for more than $10 million. The French government now issues lottery tickets once a week, selling about 500,000 tickets each time. Each ticket costs about $2.18 U.S., and there are also tickets sold in strips, with each ticket divided into ten strips, each strip costing about $0.22 U.S. There are a total of 137,328 prizes, with prize money ranging from $2.52 U.S. to $67,200 U.S.</p>
<p>The World Games held in London from July 29 to August 14 this year were attended by 54 countries. The total number of athletes is expected to be at least 5,500. Compared with the previous edition (1936, Berlin), the number of participating countries has increased by 11, and the number of athletes has increased by 1,500.</p>
<p>The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) in the United States can be said to be the most efficient detective agency in the world, but it has only been established for 25 years. Currently, the bureau has 3,800 agents, all of whom have received a university education and then undergone rigorous training. It has a collection of as many as 160 million fingerprints.</p>
<h3>Awkward Moments</h3>
<p>— Shiyu</p>
<p>You are walking down the street. If you walk to your destination in one breath, without seeing anything or encountering anything, your walk is meaningless. If you accidentally trip or even collide head-on with a passerby, your walk is full of meaning. The journey of life is like this. If you have accumulated good fortune in your previous life and your life is smooth, you will live too unbeautifully. If you are unfortunate and often step on stones under your feet, life is full of meaning. No hero has not fallen and climbed up again; nor is a good book written in one breath. Herries bragged to George Bernard Shaw because he had been "romantic," while Shaw lacked romance to speak of. Many successful politicians sigh all day in their old age, just because they never sat in jail when they were young. Generally speaking, the rich understand life the least. But if he goes bankrupt, the next dinner is full of meaning.</p>
<p>Forgetting to buy a ticket when taking the tram, forgetting to bring money when watching a movie, sneezing at a banquet, falling down the stairs at your girlfriend's house. You bring one million yuan to treat your friends to dinner, and the bill comes to 1.1 million. Such situations are common in the real world. A story from an old "Reader's Digest" says that two friends who are not very familiar with each other meet in a social setting:</p>
<p>"Look! The one wearing the bright red cheongsam is too flashy. It would be more suitable for her age to dress more simply!"</p>
<p>"Are you talking about my cousin?"</p>
<p>"Ah! I mean the one next to your sister!"</p>
<p>"That's my wife!"</p>
<p>Such a scene is enough to make us feel "sorry" all over. But the words spoken cannot be taken back, which is called an awkward moment. Comedians and humorists make money by creating this "awkward moment"; life also becomes colorful because of this "awkward moment." Since we are human, there is no "perfect person" in the world. But people with a little status or a little reputation always like to pretend to be "perfect people." So, once a paper tiger is exposed, it becomes a laughingstock. It is said that New York journalists love to fall in love with generals and talk about art with Wall Street tycoons, in order to create awkward material.</p>
<p>Yesterday, I went out for a walk and saw a stall selling baked sweet potatoes at the end of Model Road. I am a glutton, thinking that I had not tasted sweet potatoes for many months, so I ignored my dignity, weighed 10,000 yuan worth, and started eating it at the stall. There are many Nanjing refugees. Two refugee children were vying for the peels that I peeled off. Because I thought it was cute for them to grab it, I weighed 10,000 yuan worth and gave it to them. But when I touched my pocket, I forgot to bring money. I had to negotiate with the stall owner, saying that I would give it to her tomorrow, but she was furious.</p>
<p>"I don't know you. Where can I find you?"</p>
<p>"Then what should I do? This 20,000 yuan!"</p>
<p>"Leave something here with me!"</p>
<p>I gave her a magazine in my hand. She told me that newspapers were now 80,000 to 90,000 per catty, and this thin book was not worth 20,000 yuan.</p>
<p>"What to do? There's nothing to pawn!"</p>
<p>She sized me up and down. Finally, she took a fancy to the glasses I was wearing on my nose.</p>
<p>"Pawn this thing here!"</p>
<p>At this time, there was already a circle of nosy people surrounding us. I thought it was impossible to negotiate with this old woman. I took off my glasses and blurred my way back to school.</p>
<p>We like to watch "awkward" movies and like to hear "awkward" stories. But only when we personally experience "awkward" moments do we understand life.</p>
<h3>Carefree Flower</h3>
<p>— Chen Shenyan</p>
<p>Chapter 13: Salvation by the Militia (111)</p>
<p>Zhu Zhai, having thought this through, decided to go home and take a look. He instructed the rickshaw puller to go to North New Bridge. When the rickshaw arrived at his doorstep, Zhu Zhai saw that it was already past ten o'clock. After knocking on the door for a while, Feng Sheng, wearing her nightgown, came to open it. When she saw it was Zhu Zhai, she asked, "What are you doing here at this hour?" Zhu Zhai replied with a smile, "I came to see you and have a few words with you." Feng Sheng said, "You don't come during the day, but you come at this hour! There's someone here, you don't need to come in." When Zhu Zhai heard her say there was someone at home, he suddenly became suspicious and said, "This is my home, why can't I come in?" Feng Sheng said, "Go away, it's inconvenient for you to come in." Zhu Zhai refused to listen, stepping inside and saying, "I want to see who it is!" Feng Sheng said, "It's my friend, you don't know them, it's useless to go in." Zhu Zhai pushed her aside and rushed into the room. He heard Feng Sheng chasing after him, shouting, "Sit outside! There's someone inside!" Zhu Zhai ignored everything and rushed into the bedroom. He saw a person lying on the bed, completely covered by a sheet, even their face was covered, only a pile of dark hair was visible on top of their head. Zhu Zhai thought that Feng Sheng must have left a man in her room, and his anger flared. Without hesitation, he rushed to the bed and ripped off the sheet. He was shocked to see that it was a woman with powder and rouge, her disheveled hair scattered on the bed. He quickly backed away, and as he turned to leave, Feng Sheng grabbed him from behind, shouting, "Zhu Zhai! You have no manners! What kind of behavior is this?" Zhu Zhai was both frightened and ashamed, and quickly said, "I... I didn't know, please forgive me." Feng Sheng said, "No! You have to apologize to Miss Li, then I will let you go." Zhu Zhai had no choice but to turn around, bow to the female guest on the bed, and repeatedly say, "I'm sorry, I'm sorry." Then he turned and walked out. Feng Sheng followed him, as if monitoring him, saying, "Go away, I'll spare you today, don't come again!" Zhu Zhai said, "Feng Sheng, I have something to tell you, let's talk for a few minutes." Feng Sheng said, "There's nothing to say, go away! It's getting late, hurry up and leave! It's not convenient for you to be here." Zhu Zhai said, "This is my home, what's inconvenient?" Feng Sheng opened her eyes wide and said loudly, "This is your home? You don't have this home, go away!" Zhu Zhai said, "You won't even let me say a few words?" Feng Sheng said, "We've said everything, there's nothing more to say, leave!" Zhu Zhai said, "What I want to say today concerns the rest of our lives, don't be angry, please listen to me calmly, okay?" Feng Sheng said, "No! No need! There's nothing between us, I already consider you dead!"</p>
<h3>### Swindling</h3>
<p>— Jiujiu</p>
<p>In 1878, a Mrs. Humbert in Paris suddenly announced that an American millionaire named Crawford had bequeathed his entire estate of twenty million dollars to her. Crawford's two nephews demanded a share of the inheritance, leading to a protracted lawsuit. The court, facing difficulties in its investigation, delayed its judgment. Securities and stocks held in the bank by Mrs. Humbert were deemed untouchable by the court due to the undetermined property rights, forcing her to borrow money to survive, promising to repay everything as soon as the lawsuit ended. Parisian merchants, knowing that the lawsuit would inevitably be in her favor, seized the opportunity to provide her with a steady stream of loans—at exorbitant interest rates—preparing to make a fortune.</p>
<p>However, the case remained unresolved for twenty-four years. During these twenty-four years, Mrs. Humbert raised a total of eleven million dollars, enjoying a rather comfortable life.</p>
<p>But in 1902, it was finally discovered that the so-called American millionaire Crawford, in fact, never existed! The creditors panicked and rushed to the bank to open Mrs. Humbert's safety deposit box, only to find it empty.</p>
<p>Among these creditors, ten committed suicide as a result. A new trial by the court revealed that the so-called two nephews of Crawford were actually accomplices of Mrs. Humbert. Their twenty-four-year lawsuit was merely a smokescreen, and the ignorant Parisian judges had, in effect, become accomplices of these three swindlers.</p>
<h3>### Lament for Tonglu</h3>
<p>— Shi Shufan</p>
<p>Entering Tonglu in broad daylight, the city is filled with a ghostly atmosphere, empty houses cast tall shadows, a scene of desolate waste. Feet tread on rubble and tiles, shattered and difficult to distinguish, above, crows fly in flocks, dogs play in the streets. Climbing the mountain behind the government office, the rice is tall, reaching the knees, dry grain sends out frosty shoots, once used to feed the barbarian cavalry. On top is a large white poplar, built like a bunker, spying on our army on the river, transmitting electricity to fire weapons. The Tongjun Temple is close by, the Buddha ruined, the pagoda also abandoned, rowing upstream in the past, now separated by a lifetime. The guide said: the city fell in summer, the eastern wind and barbarian dogs proud, the old and weak unable to escape, drawing their knives to rape and plunder at will, many women committed suicide, corpses were not buried under the scorching sun, often abandoned in ponds, once the plum rains passed, the water was red with severed arms floating, seeing the blue sky in July, few houses remained unburned, surviving people gathered again, spending the night in the wind and dew, drawing water to cook tea and rice, human grease stuck to the pot, swarms of flies fought to chase, what taste did they know entering their mouths! Who knew that at the beginning of August, a greater calamity would be remembered, enemy planes covered the sky, stones turned red, the river water boiled, startled souls dared not return, and long stayed in the wilderness. On quiet nights, looking at the empty city, the pain was extreme, turning into tearlessness, counting the few tung oil lamps, lonely soldiers and historians.</p>
<h3>### Raindrops</h3>
<p>— Shi Jimei</p>
<p>A butterfly is a social butterfly; once made into a specimen, it's a glamorous corpse in a funeral home.</p>
<p>"Quickly cuckoo, quickly cuckoo!" In the early spring wilderness, it sings all night, singing until it vomits blood; the cuckoo, like Qu Yuan, the Three Dukes, who embraced a rock and sank into the river, is just as great.</p>
<p>If geese are organized, then a lone goose is an individualist.</p>
<p>Some people write stories with a pen, and others, with their own lives.</p>
<p>"The rise and fall of the nation is the responsibility of every individual." — Most individuals interpret "responsibility" as "blame" rather than "duty."</p>
<p>The elderly are the most innocent because they regard all young people as fools.</p>
<p>After dusk, draw the curtains and light the lamp, but you won't forget the darkness outside.</p>
<p>The way of the wolf and the bai to deal with the world is official protection, crabs walk sideways because they have no intestines; cuttlefish want to be cultured, so they absorb a bellyful of ink.</p>
<p>The most loyal and honest friend is a mirror.</p>
<p>Qingming Festival, the living put on a show, with the deceased making guest appearances.</p>
<p>April Fool's Day is a day of great laughter for self-proclaimed clever fools all over the world.</p>
<p>If an old lady doesn't chant scriptures, she'll go crazy; so it's best not to break superstitions.</p>
<h3>### West Lake Poetry Records</h3>
<p>— Banmeng Laoren</p>
<p>The beauty of West Lake lies, in my opinion, with Bai Causeway. Its grass is as soft as a carpet, its flowers as red as brocade, with distant mountains and nearby waters woven into a wonderful natural painting. Often there are graceful figures in pairs, with red makeup and green sleeves, basking in the warm sun and gentle breeze, lying in the floral carpet, whispering sweet nothings, happily forgetting their weariness, hardly knowing what age it is.</p>
<p>As for Su Causeway, the north-south distance is too long, and compared to Bai Causeway, its charm is slightly inferior. In the middle, besides the wide road, there are also small brick paths on both sides, shaded by willow trellises, making it extremely comfortable to stroll around. From time to time, men and women ride bicycles together, speeding past like lightning. In the early morning or at sunset, I often sit alone in a small pavilion, composing poetry and seeking inspiration, considering myself enjoying a quiet blessing, occasionally writing: "A pair of figures rush by on wheels in the wind, drooping willows on both sides tied like silk, mostly solitary poetic companions are few, accompanying me in the pavilion sitting often. (The pavilion is named Banshan Pavilion.) Near Jiang Villa, the red railing bridge, deep courtyard with no one, tree shadows swaying, white gulls outside the door more leisurely than me, a pair standing with raised feet where the lotus flowers are red. (When lotus flowers bloom, white gulls often stand on one foot, their whiteness accentuating the flower's red.) The mountain light on both sides meets the water light, listening to the clear waves in a winding curve, tired, I prop my chin on a stone table, idly watching light boats glide in the setting sun."</p>
<p>After my trip to Hangzhou, my will remained undecided. My poetry friend, the Lay Buddhist Mujushi, went to Ziyun Cave first, and then urged me to go with a poem: "Yan Zhai sends letters from the sea, asking me about leisure in the mountains, the joy of mountain living is endless, how can I remember each item from the beginning. I remember the morning light dyeing the quilt, eating my fill all day, but playing, the rising sun fills the east window, this is a place of wonder, the temple is known for its ingenuity. (The temple's name) A bowl of porridge in the early morning and I go out, cane and straw shoes wherever I wish, sometimes visiting the immortals' relics, the ancient well and cinnabar are still recognizable, overlooking the spring from the Chuyang platform, the misty water I look at freely, happy to hear the golden drums drinking in Yellow Dragon (both cave names), casually entering the ancient temple, the mood strikes me so I idle on Su Causeway, the drooping willows so affectionate to give shade. Walking I suddenly pass Apricot Blossom Village (on the side of Su Causeway), buying wine to come back to get drunk, the purple bamboo shoots and garden vegetables all in season, plain rice actually makes me tired of meat and grease. Once drunk and full I fall into peaceful sleep, the yellow orioles sing loudly, urging me to come out, grabbing my clothes I stand in front of the door, mountain and lake light rush into my eyes, bamboo forest and pine trees I wander under, wild grasses and hidden flowers are charming, standing alone on the high peak, I shoot the colorful clouds onto my chest, occasionally inviting the bright moon to knock on my wood door, the clear light enters my dreams in the middle of the night. These days the spring rain has been incessant, sitting around I don't need to put on Ruan Gong clogs, the misty scenery is right at the window, glittering and making wondrous sights, a person in the mountain is within a painting, understanding the painting and seeing the real thing. There is another matter to tell you, I face the place of burial everyday (going out of the mountain gate, seeing graves), I wonder when this hole will be my final resting place, once I sleep I will truly be happy, alas, Huan An still has a hermitage he cannot return to, and I am still burdened by worldly matters, Yan Zhai and Huan An are one and the same, what is the point of not returning to Yan, giving up the beautiful scenery before me!" Yan Zhai and Huan An are both my nicknames, and the decision to go to Hangzhou was made.</p>
<p>Later, after the Dragon Boat Festival, I went straight to Ziyun, and lived in a room separate from the lay Buddhist Mujushi. Opening the window, I faced West Lake, with flying clouds on the ridges and moonlight sifting through the pines. Often I saw white birds flying low and yellow orioles talking to each other, unknowingly washing away all worldly dust. I wrote a poem to record it: "Accompanying fairy companions to Pengying, sleeping high in the cave, the guest is feeling clear, white clouds on the ridge as leisurely as me, the black-robed friends in the mountains talk of non-birth. (The abbot is a western monk who comes often to discuss Zen.) Morning meal sitting and facing a thousand flower buds, waking from a midday nap to the sound of birds, worldly glory and dishonor, why ask, a peaceful heart doesn't care." Later, the abbot compared me to Vimalakirti, so I sat cross-legged in meditation, closing the door to practice meditation. At this time, I only hoped for the moon to light up the heart of the waves, and the wind to stir the surface of the water, to have a bright and clear image. Occasionally I wrote: "Staying a short while in Louxia, (next to Miaozhi temple, there are caves called Qixia.) all thoughts extinguished, all matters ceased, rolling spring flourishes beautifying my temples, rustling wind leaves the moon above. Human life is fleeting like dew among flowers, Buddhist Dharma is a compassionate boat on the sea, washing away the dust on my lapel, I have no self-image, I am a lone seagull in the heavens and earth."</p>
<p>One day, I went down the mountain, and on the Lingyin road, I suddenly met Zen Master Huanjue. Huanjue is a poetic monk, and it had been ten years since we last met. We shook hands with joy, and I composed a poem on the spot to give to him: "Smiling and meeting on the banks of West Lake, shaking hands in the same car, recognizing the old face, one sentence of Amitabha revealing the profound mystery, ten years of deep connection imprint our wandering traces, green mountains and green waters, idle clouds passing by, fragrant trees and sweet dew, Dharma milk soaking, working hard upwards cannot be achieved, everyone work hard on the peak." We returned to Ziyun together, discussing Zen and debating the Tao every day. The master gave me a poem: "Who would have expected such a fortunate encounter on this sacred lake, shaking hands in surprise, seeing the old face, one thought of non-birth extinguishing accumulated habits, a hundred years fortunate to rest like duckweed, cave heaven and blessed land, a quiet place of joy, green trees and clear springs, the taste of Tao is rich, deeply understanding the Zen of Tathagata, I envy you for occupying the wonderful peak first." Huanjue studied Confucianism and Buddhism, scrutinizing all books. After gathering for more than a month, he left.</p>
<p>The weather gradually turned cool, and I visited Master Huanjue in a small hermitage on Ziyang Mountain. The master prepared a vegetarian meal for me, and the dishes were exquisite. I said to the master, "We, who roam beyond the world, regard our bodies as travelers. The burden of food and drink is already superfluous, let alone undeserved?" The master said, "Today is the Buddha's birthday, and the vegetables are slightly prepared, slightly better than Ziyun. Your praise is excessive." After the meal, we went out of the hermitage together and climbed to the top of the first peak of Wu Mountain. Looking down, smoke rose from countless stoves. The sky was high and the sun was bright, with a great wind blowing wildly. We tried to open our umbrellas to shield us from the sun, but could not withstand the wind, so we descended the mountain by another path. I improvised a poem: "The grand view from the top of Wu Mountain, the rivers and lakes open on the left and right, opening the umbrella against the wind, wanting to fly away, ten thousand families, well walls sandwiched on all sides." Along the way, we passed Tiaodong Rock (place name) and visited Dharma Master Zhao Zhen. The golden image of the Buddha was magnificent. Behind it was a high slope with a four-sided pavilion built on top. Crystal curtains and green doors, the fragrance of sandalwood filled the air. The green trees embraced each other, the shade thick, and I could not bear to leave. I also got a quatrain: "Intent on repairing monasteries everywhere, the Buddha's face shines on sentient flowers, collecting the heart and lowering the head, compassionate father, purifying thousands of differences and ten thousand differences." After going down the mountain, we parted ways.</p>
<p>When I was sitting quietly, I opened the window to look at West Lake from afar. Lay Buddhist Mujushi especially liked to lean on the window sill with a long chair, sitting and watching the vastness. I often sat with him. One day it rained, and it didn't stop for a long time. I saw more than a dozen people in white hemp clothes on the mountainside, men and women mixed together, carrying a coffin up the mountain, lowering it into the pit for burial. In about three hours, the tomb was covered, and the men and women went down the mountain together, never hearing the sound of crying, like a scene from a movie. The ancients said, "In the blink of an eye, the wilderness becomes a grave." And, "Leaving behind dry bones buried in the wild, where do the vast spirits go?" Those who are enthusiastic about utilitarianism can take this as a lesson. I got a couplet: "The four elements form a false combined form, a sudden breakdown severs the life soul, in the desolate grave under the autumn wind and bitter rain, who are the husband and wife, who are the descendants? Soil makes clothes and wood makes skin, sleeping long and slow, scattering my present self, who threw it into the corner of the empty mountain, only to accompany the decaying bones. Love and affection in life are forgotten in death, mistaking tenderness for the homeland, letting go of the hand in the Yellow Springs, departing separately, white clothes accompany each other to the final resting place. The family has no sorrow, I shed tears secretly, sending you off, the person is gone, the earth surrounds, the lonely grave is accompanied by nothing else, desolate weeds and lush green fill the mountain!" Blowing the wrinkles on a pool of spring water, what is my business, throwing down the pen I laughed to myself, and the lay Buddhist Mujushi also smiled.</p>
<p>Ziyun Cave is behind the mountain of Chuyang Terrace, and it is even closer to climb Geling. I have repeatedly wanted to climb Chuyang at night to see the moon, but stopped because I had no companion. This summer has ended, and I have returned to Shanghai, counting on my fingers, I have only gained four months. My poetry friend, Mr. Cheng Guojun, asked about it remotely with a poem, and I replied: "Four months of leisurely living and extravagant travel, embracing the deep secluded north and south peaks, the willow color of Six Bridges encloses the long causeway, the lotus fragrance of ten li collects in the ancient cave. The lone crane of Lonely Mountain is already faint, coming again to the scenic spot, all the talent of a whole ox, how can I bear to walk with a cane in the west wind, the desolate Xiao temple is not to be lingered." Painting is silent poetry, and poetry is colorless painting. Use this record as a reclining travel map, wouldn't that be almost right?</p>
