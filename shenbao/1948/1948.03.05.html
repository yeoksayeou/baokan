<h3>麥帥陳述援華意見　軍事問題應先解決　中國自由關係世界和平</h3>
<p>〔美國新聞處華盛頓三日電〕麥克阿瑟將軍，本日對於國會邀渠返美爲援華案作證事，予以婉辭；但以電致衆院叙述意見，表示支特援華。</p>
<p>〔中央社華盛頓三日電〕麥帥今電吿衆院外委會主席伊頓稱，「一自由獨立和平而友善之中國，對於世界和平，乃極爲重要者。目前中國一切問題之根本，厥爲軍事問題，在其內部復原可望獲得進展以前，此一問題，必須予以解決。」按此係麥帥統率盟軍總部以來對中國問題之首次聲明。麥帥自東京發來之此項電報，乃對外委會請渠發表其關於援華計劃意見之正式答復。渠强調稱，由於各方之要求其進行內部改革，遂使中國問題之國際面爲之晦澀不明，而內部改革，對於中國之內戰問題而言，僅係次要問題而已。麥帥宣稱：「對中國之需求或中國之重要性而予低估，是誠大謬不然者，吾人果從事一項普遍政策，以保衛自由之邊疆，阻遏政治專暴主義者之擊，則各處疆界之重要性，彼此均不相上下」（麥帥致伊頓電全文具左角）</p>
<h3>眾院另擬援華計劃　歐洲復原計劃為援華藍本　馬歇爾稱已與我當局商討</h3>
<p>〔中央社華盛頓三日電〕頃悉：衆院援華計劃法案，刻在草議中，可於下週正式提出。該法案將依照美法官兼中國問題專家阿樂滿，昨向衆院外委會，列舉之經濟援助計劃制訂，其中主張以九億美元以上之經濟採助，另加數額未定之軍事援助。</p>
<p>〔又電〕共和黨衆議員伏里斯稱：軍事援助將列入擬議中之援華法案中。</p>
<p>〔又電〕馬歇爾今向衆院外委會答復問題時稱，美曾與中國政府商討關於以歐洲復原計劃，作爲援華計劃藍本之問題。並謂：「吾人已與中國外長王世杰，中國駐美大使顧維鈞，及刻在美國之中國技術代表團，就上述問題加以商討。同時，衆院外委會中支特政府對軍事援華所持立塲，及反對將對外經濟與軍事援助法案混爲「一體」民主黨議員，今提出就援華計劃發表意見之發言人名單，其中有前駐華大使高思，卸任不久之駐華美軍顧問團長魯克斯，前聯總署長魯克斯，前聯總中國分署署長艾格敦，美駐華大使館前海軍武官麥克猷，及聯邦準備局經濟專家塔瑪格納等人，但未列明聰取上述人士意見之日期。</p>
<h3>魏德邁援華證詞　苟不予軍事援助阻共產主義擴張　美將需以流血為代價</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕紐約四日廣播，華盛頓訊，美軍前駐華司令魏德邁將軍，四日出席衆院外委會作證，聲稱：苟不迅速採取步驟以遏止共產主義之擴張，則美國將需「以流血爲代價」。如欲阻止共產主義之「廣泛行動」，美國除以經濟援助給予他國外，並須予以軍事援助。魏氏調：渠對馬歇爾將軍素具仰慕之忱，惟對軍事援助問題，意見確甚懸殊。渠不信單籍經濟援助可在世界任何地區阻止共產主義，渠認爲在目前情形下，美國毋需在軍事上直接參與中國之反共戰鬥，惟應以軍事援助供給中國國民政府。渠謂：兩年前單以經濟援助二億美元給予中國，即有辦法，但鑒於自此以後共產黨之勢力已較前增强，故認爲目下縱使給予五億七千萬美元之經濟援助亦屬不够，必須輔以軍事援助方能收效。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕陳納德將軍應美衆院外委會之邀請，日內即乘機飛美，於三月十日前趕抵華盛頓，爲援華案作證。據陳氏稱，渠正在趕擬意見書，對援華案意見決以軍事及經濟援華爲中心，而軍事援華尤爲前提。</p>
<h3>麥帥有意　竸選總統</h3>
<p>援華主張中已表示</p>
<p>〔合衆社東京四日電〕據接近麥師之人士稱：麥帥關於援華之意見，實明白表示渠將接受提名爲總統候選人。其競選政綱，即爲阻止蘇聯擴張之世界計劃。</p>
<p>麥帥今日不願誇大渠答覆衆院外交委員會主席伊頓之各數。此間中國方面盛譽麥帥之聲明爲「至今第一個世界政治家，對中國人民所遭遇之主要問題作最明晰之分析」。</p>
<h3>美官員麥卡倍　浪費剩餘物資</h3>
<p>共和黨議員揭布內幕</p>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓三日電〕參院銀行委員會今日審査前任海外剩餘資產管理局長麥卡倍出任聯邦準備局局員之資格時，共和黨參議員杜倍發表萬言聲明，指責麥氏對華出售剩餘資產措置失當。據稱：麥卡倍之駐華代辦約翰生，曾商定以幾乎全新之B—25型爆炸機十一架，售予宋子良所開設之某公司。當報紙發表此項交易消息時，麥氏即擅越職權，飭將售出飛機截去機尾。麥氏承認其作用在避免國內不利之宣傳。另有B—25型新機一架，價値廿四萬三千元，並未被列入剩餘資產，亦被麥氏手下同樣處置。</p>

<h3>麥帥致伊頓電全文</h3>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓三日電〕麥帥致衆議院外交委員會主席伊頓一電之全文如后：</p>
<p>「衆議院外交委員會邀本人返國向該會申述對援華政策之意見，具見對本人信托之深，本人感激莫名！</p>
<p>日本行政之處理異常繁劇，尤其日來日本政府在交替中，致本人無法稍離職守。即使情形不如此，本人是否能對援華建議之細則提供有用而建設性之意見，即本人亦極引以為疑，况本人迄今未見亦無機會硏究此項細則</p>
<p>恐閣下亦知，中國係在美海軍之行動範圍內，而爲本人目前職權所不及者。本人無代表駐中國，除一般歷史外，本人所知之詳細消息大多數係間接得來。</p>
<p>美國負責官員曾精心硏究中國局勢，然此項硏究不在本人職權及消息來源之中，故本人對此不甚熟悉，况多年來，本人迄無機緣一訪中國。對此一特殊地區之確定政策，當然有賴於無數之詳盡細節，然本人之情形旣如此，閣下當可知本人實無從對上述細節提出權威性之忠吿。</p>
<p>閣下提出之問題雖條分樓析，本人僅能籠統作覆。本人能毅然稱：一個獨立，自由，友好之中國，對世界和平及美國之地位，具有莫大之重要性</p>
<p>這就是太平洋穹門之基石。</p>
<p>中國問題歸根結蒂只有軍事問題一個，除非軍事問題能吿解決，雖有外援，國內之復興亦難望有進展；一旦此問題解決，則中國之傳統復原性能無疑可成爲迅速恢復相對穩定之基礎</p>
<p>美國政策之定向，應整個考慮世界局勢，而中國問題僅爲其一部份。</p>
<p>苟於世界上不相關聯之地區，作零星之決定，則整個問題仍無法解決。以美國立塲而言，此問題爲全盤問題，僅能循最廣泛全球性之基礎加以解決。吾人如低估中國之需要或其重要性，必將鑄成大錯。如吾人進行一般政策，强化自由之邊疆，以防專制政治之侵襲，則每一主要邊疆，均具有相等之重要性，如在一方面犯有嚴重之失誤，則全功均毁於一旦。</p>
<p>東西同等重要　不應忽視亞洲</p>
<p>美後代命運繫於太平洋</p>
<p>由於根深蒂固之種族上，文化上及商業上之連繫，吾人頗易過份專注美國以東地區之情事，而忽視吾人以西地區之重要性．美國之過去歷史深深種源於大西洋彼岸，然美國後代欲與前時之進步並駕齊驅、其希望亦築於太平洋彼岸之局勢。</p>
<p>吾人充份利用美國以東之淵源時，對西方地平綫而言，應一方面通渦亞洲民族之進步而獲得前時所無之貿易商業機會，以尋求改善生活之希望；另一方而亦應注視有害吾人之生活之威脅。</p>
<p>在地平綫以外，對峙之勢力正從事於思想上之鬥爭，戰爭或和平，保證或威脅，希望或恐懼，均有視乎鬥爭之結果，及政治經濟社會平衡之能否恢復。</p>
<p>要求內政改革　目前實非其時</p>
<p>屋已着火何能更易棟樑</p>
<p>中國問題之國際面，不幸頗受內政改革之要求所蔽塞。改革雖屬必需，然其重要性尙次於籠罩全中國之內爭問題，而此兩門題又無法互相配合，猶如房舍着火，而旁人尙斤斤於改革其棟樑。</p>
<p>吾人對中國政治之改革極感友善之興趣，並希望中國能接近吾人對自由公平之理想。維持中國之獨立，以抗拒勢欲淹呑中國之破壞力量，其重要性更宜亟須注意。蓋主權能屹然存在，將來自然而然能以演變方式進行改革也。</p>
<p>軍事剩餘物資　公允配予中國</p>
<p>勿低估中國軍略重要性</p>
<p>以吾人所需以外之軍事剩餘物咨運往中國，已恢復矣。吾人更應根據美國政策方向所決定之全球性援助之公允比例，衡量更多之援華物資。美政策定向時，不應低佔一個自由和平中國對吾人及世界之軍略重要性，不應忽略中國所經多年戰亂而造成之貧乏與勞疲，不應錯佑其穩定及發展吾人未來生活水準之潛力，亦不應漠然無視於兩國在歷年和平戰爭中信而固堅之長期友好關係。</p>
<p>在決定吾人之世界政策時，固應審愼從事，以免消耗吾人之資源於力所不能担任之義務上，使吾人國力减削而危及本國之安全，以免重累吾國人民，使無人維持其力所應得之生活水準。</p>
<p>吾人如放棄自己之自由，以保障他人之自由，實屬不合邏輯；吾人如以物貿援助他人，而無望取得對方對人類之進步有所貢獻以爲報答，亦屬不合邏輯；蓋吾人如犧牲一己，而在他處造成貧乏困竭，而阻碍人類之進步，則又何補於吾人之目的？</p>
<p>美國人民在危急之際，靡不挺身而出，爭爲先登，以接受大時代之挑戰。此乃美國人之傳統特徵。</p>
<p>舉世混亂，亟需吾人容知大無畏及積極之領導，作爲安定之勢力，從未有若今日之甚者。美國人民如認此爲有意義之犧牲而準備捨己助人，亦未有若今日之甚者。</p>
<p>吾人生活於美國之土地上，使舉世明瞭一種生活方式，雖有混亂不安自私慾望蔽甚明，此生活方式仍爲全人類所嚮往之希望及目標。</p>

<p>〔本報南京四日電〕立院財委會四日晨開小組會，討論張肇元所提改革幣制計劃，簡貫三主席，財部錢幣司長戴銘禮，央行經硏處長吳大眾均列席，首由張氏報吿其計劃稱：渠在美時曾與工商界人士及議員多人討論我國恢復銀幣之可能，僉以我國物價之穩定，於促進對外貿易有莫大裨益，而改革幣制可使國人恢復對通貨價値之信用，有助物價之平抑，渠估計共需白銀十億盎斯，以之錢成五錢重銀幣廿億枚，對外匯維持一定兌換率，現行法幣仍繼續存在，而以適當之比率自由兌換銀幣，一俟幣値物價穩定後，可另發紙幣流通，貶値之法幣自可逐漸消滅。繼戴司長以官方立塲謂，銀幣可作補幣，而不宜作本幣，改革幣制目的，在使通貨價値不再下跌，然如物價無平穩可能，改革之效果難期，故改革時機似尚未至。旋各委員紛發表意見，多認發行銀幣困難頗多，借銀固屬不易，人民藏銀，共匪奮取，均足影響改發銀幣之效果，最後決定由張氏整理審査意見併其計劃作成建議書後，提出院會討論。</p>

<p>社論</p>
<h3>麥帥對於援華的卓見</h3>
<p>美國援華的呼聲，我們聞之已耳熟能詳。我們感謝友邦朝野如此關切中國問題，而對於麥克阿瑟元帥最近電復美國國會所表示援華首重軍事援助這一點，尤其覺得萬分欽佩。久駐遠來的軍事專家，畢竟有卓見，有遠識！</p>
<p>溯自杜魯門總統向美國會提出五億七千萬美元援華計劃之後，美國兩院委員曁輿論界多半認爲分量小足，對於政府未列入軍事援助，尤表不滿。卽使在馬歇爾國務卿本人，也承認單靠財政援助，猶不足以挽救中國政府的危念。日來參衆兩院正在積極討論援華問題，已觸及此一問題的實際核心。美國外交家蒲立特大使二日在衆院外交委員會作證，對援華問題作緊急迫切的呼籲，力陳美國在遠東的危機，堅決主張軍事援華。蒲氏的一席話，雖已足一正美國朝野對於中國問題的視聽，但自從蒲氏由華返美後，一直在大聲疾呼，要求他們國人提高對於遠東危機的警覺，故二日的蹬言，在美國人士或不免視爲老生常談。衆議院外交委員會主席伊頓乃更電請東京的麥帥及在中國的飛虎將軍陳納德氏返國作證，俾報吿遠東的實情况，並發表他曾對於援華問題的意見。飛虎將軍不久卽將返美作證，我們相信他一定可以揭穿中共叛亂的眞相，姑置不論；現在且先一談麥帥的備忘錄。</p>
<p>麥帥對於國會邀請返美作證，雖已婉辭，但已向華府，出一備忘錄，陳述其對於援華的意見。其要點如次：（一）中國問題主要在軍事，必須先解決軍事，然後始能言及經濟復興及其他改革，故力主軍事援華。（二）中國爲太平洋拱門的基本台柱，一自由獨立和平與友善之中國，對於世界和平與美國地位，均極重要。（三）警吿國會不得因種族，文化，商務關係之密切而過分化中注意於歐洲事伴。（四）低估中國之需要及其重要性，實屬謬誤。（五）美國不特應注意中國之改革，抑且亦應關切中國之完整，以防制破壞勢力使其陷入深淵。（六）中國政府目前最需要軍事援助。（七）中國問題爲世界問題之一環，應以整個的世界眼光，加以觀察。</p>
<p>從這些意見看來，可知麥帥從未忽視中國在亞洲的重要性，而他的見解，正一如吾人所欲言。尤爲難得的，是他能够率直指出：「在共黨未擊敗前，卽欲中國完成內政改革，無異對正在被焚之房屋，企圖改換其建築圖樣」。這真是目光如炬，一針見血的話。他的了解中國到這般地步，實出一般人意料之外。外界對於麥帥的猜測紛紜，不是說麥帥欲扶持日本以反對條聯，就是說麥帥根本不重視中國在遠東的地位，但經過他這次嚴正表示以後，不僅可一掃常人的誤解，而且更可澄淸目前的輿論，使我們獲得幾個基本的認識。</p>
<p>第一，美國朝野不論是民主黨也好，共和黨也好，對於援華問題，無一不主張積極進行，除了財政援助而外，更須着重軍事援助。我們作一客觀的研究，美國輿論界所以能有此進一步的認訓，大槪有兩種原因：一方面，是因爲中國局勢的惡化，而且政治經濟以及軍事三者，原是互為因果的，單靠美國在經濟上緩和喘息的援助，已不足以挽救中國的危急。另一方面，美國朝野對於遠東的局勢，均巳較有正確的認識，不復爲共黨虛偽宣傳所欺騙，不要說一般有遠見的外交家。政論家和參衆兩院議員，對於政府未將軍事援助列入援華計劃之內，一致表示不滿，就是主持援華計劃的馬歇爾國務卿，也承認單靠這區區五億七千萬美元的援助，也是無濟於事的了。現在徵求麥帥的意見，麥帥也認爲軍事援華實有其必要。由此我們相信，美國朝野必更積極的主張，除經濟援助而外，對華將更有軍事的援助。美國是一個民主國家，一切內政外交的方針，都要接受大多數人民的意見。杜魯門總統的援華計劃，雖僅限於五億七千萬美元，並未列入軍事援助，但照目前的趨勢看來，參衆兩院或將加以修正。軍事援華計劃的實行，是非常有希望的。</p>
<p>第二，近半年來，一般人十對於美國近年來的措置及麥帥在東京的言行，往往表示懷疑，以爲美國有忽視中國而扶助日本的意向。這種疑竇的發生，不能不說由於美國政府對於日本的態度不够明朗所致。而這種扶持日本政策的後果，直接受其不利影響的，第一個就是中國。我國朝野人士，戚受威脅之餘，難免對於美國對日政策的疑懼。現在看了麥帥的覆電，可知麥帥深悉中國所處地位的重要，中國不特爲亞洲的重要基點，與世界和平極關重要，而且中國政局的變動，共黨勢力的囂張，足以影響及於日本，菲島，暹羅，印度，甚至美國在遠東及太平洋的地位也必面目全非。馬帥在國會辯論援華問題時曾說：中國東北局勢的惡化，足以影響美國在日本朝鮮的地位。現在麥帥也特別强調中國對於世界和平及美國地位之重要，可知英雄所見略同。從此，外界的疑雲固可煥然冰釋，而中美之間今後如何配合行動，共維世界和平，也將以美國實行軍事援華開其端。</p>
<p>第三，一直到目前爲止，美國國內尙有一部分人士，受了共黨及其外圍僞裝宣傳的蒙蔽，對於「中共」認識不淸，始終以爲「中共」是一個普通的政黨，不相信它是一個勾結異族，陰謀以暴力奪取政權的匪黨。但易看了麥帥的覆電，一定可以恍然大悟了。「中共」不僅完全聽命於莫斯科，而且「中共」的弄兵作亂，正是是產極權國家所鼓動的「世界暴力革命」的一環。「中共」如若成功，在中國也組織共產政權，則中國卽淪爲極權國的附庸，豈再有民主自由之可言？最近捷克政變，就是一個絕好的證明！勝利之初，「中共」也曾高唱一聯合政府」的口號，政治協商的空氣也似乎時髦之至，殊不知當時卽使成功，亦難保瞪「中共」小再發動「政變」。所以與「中共」妥協，事實上證明此路不通。美國朋友今天能有此認識，對於理解中國問題，實有極大的裨益：對於防止遠東戰爭，也等於準備注射防</p>
<p>總之，爲中美合作計，爲遠東和平計，爲民主自由的前途計，我們竭誠歡迎麥帥和其他遠見者軍事援華的卓見！</p>

<h3>比利時總理主持揭幕　五國會商西歐聯盟　繼開秘密會討論英法草案</h3>
<p>〔路透社布魯塞爾四日電〕英法荷比盧五國討論西歐聯盟之會議，今日在比外交部揭幕，由比總理兼外長史巴克親臨主持。五國國旗並插於外交部大厦之上，在外部會議室中中巴直致開幕短辭，他說：</p>
<p>「吾人値茲歐洲自由已臨末日的今天，在此開會以覓取溝通我各個國家間天然魄不通點，而組織一個政治經濟集團的方法，吾人之係迫於共產勢力的擠張而採取此一行動，實已不言可喩。共產于義巳毁滅了一度自傲的羅波匈南捷諸國，今更已逼近芬蘭·當英外相貝文先生提出團結西歐本國及其屬地資源的建議時，極少數人相信此一計劃得在我們一代中完成，然而今距建議提出之日不過四十天的時期，吾人已知員文先生的計劃並非虛幻之談。今日吾人已別無選擇，祗有接受其建議的一途，因爲他的建議巳不祗是一個空洞的建議。吾們必須團結一致，捐棄成見，建立我們的資源，以愛好自由國家的偉大壁壘，增强共力量來應付東方。諸位今日巳開始西歐聯盟計劃的工作，諸位將開始硏究一個條約草案。這一個條約在政治上及經濟上，當然同時亦必然的在軍事上，將聯合我們歐洲五國及海外非洲的土地。我們共同的未來，或許就種源於此。諸位均已了解局勢的迫切，本人亦不擬多贅，祗請諸位開始工作，因爲時間實已萬分迫切，無甚多餘了。」</p>
<p>史巴克主持開會儀式畢，即退出會塲。五國代表專家遂開始秘密會議。英法代表團已携來五國公約的草案，其要點包括：（一）西歐聯盟應包括英法荷比盧及義大利，又伊比里安半島國家及斯坎的那維亞國家將邀其考慮參加。（二）西歐國家所將參加之任何條約，應包括接受互助甚至赴戰，以互助的原則，協助被聯盟以外之國在違反聯合國憲章的情形下攻擊聯盟任何一個盟國。（三）聯盟國應交換軍事團，防務計劃，武器及配備。（四）在經濟方面應即根據國際貿易憲草及哈伐那會議的規定，謀關稅壁壘之减低。英法草案並規定設法開發歐洲之資源，以爲「自由歐洲」之供應來源。比京美國人士表示相信，五國盟約草案必能在會後產生。英國雖不參加會議，但將隨時獲得會務進展之通知，英共和邦諸國亦然。</p>
<h3>三强討論西德問題　會議今日可結束　賠償問題及三區合併均經討論</h3>
<p>〔路透社倫敦三日電〕與西歐聯盟計劃前途有重要關係的西德問題，可望在本屆倫敦三强會議週五結東前獲得答案。（一）英美法及荷比盧於將此次會談結果呈報本國政府後，是否將規定續開德國問題會談之日期。（二）奉命硏究魯爾國際政權等重要問題之小組會，將於本屆全會結束前提出報告，抑將於本屆全會結東後繼續討論。</p>
<p>荷比盧發言人昨曾在會中提出此一問題，巳經主席英代表史屈朗保證容後予以答覆。本屆會議如獲成功，自當設立若干水久性機構，以備與會六國就永久問題交換意見。昨日之下半部會議，荷比盧未曾參加，議題乃賠償問題，意即賠償問題中需要英美法三强以佔領國地位決定之部份。據確息，荷代表凡杜南曾重申一切賠償問題對荷比盧均產生興趣之立塲。今日之會中，荷比盧代表仍未出席，故料所討論者當如西德三佔領區之合併問題。今去閉會之期僅有兩日，故四日之會當有六國代表之參加，土地問題迄尚未被討論，或當於四日提出討論。</p>
<h3>土耳其允參加　十六國會議</h3>
<p>英美艦隊將訪土港口</p>
<p>〔路透社安加拉四日電〕土耳其已於今日接受英法之邀，允諾參加三月十五日之馬歇爾方案巴黎會議。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社安加拉四日電〕據土國報載，英美艦隊將於十六日訪問土耳其各海口。此次訪土艦隊中聞包括航空母艦「中途」號在內，將至士麥那及伊斯坦埠兩土國港口訪問。</p>
<h3>法義將簽訂　兩國關稅同盟</h3>
<p>〔合衆社巴黎四日電〕法外交部宣佈，外長皮杜爾不久將赴杜林，會同義外長史福薩簽訂法義關稅同盟條約，法政府方面相信，該條約對兩國經濟將大有裨益</p>
<h3>米契爾宣布　係被迫退位　幕後有外國唆使</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕倫敦四日廣播；前羅馬尼亞國王米契爾今日首次公開表示，渠之退位，係出於共產黨之威迫。渠仍自認爲實際上之國王，此點顯示將來時機成熟時，渠仍擬恢復王位。渠雖未直接指出蘇聯之名，但請羅共黨迫使其退位之行動，係由外國在幕後指使，共黨政府根本不能代表民意云。</p>
<h3>義擬與中英法　締結友好條約</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社羅馬三日電〕義國旣擬與中法二國商訂友訂友好條約，茲轉外部復在計劃與英締結同樣條約，希望不日與各有關政府作初步之談話。</p>
<h3>南極英屬地　貝文稱決不放棄</h3>
<p>領館受屬英向危提抗議</p>
<p>〔合衆社倫敦三日電〕外相貝文吿下院稱：最近阿根廷與智利在南極英屬地上登陸，實爲非法者，雖英海軍力較戰前减少，然黨國必當保護其在南極之權利。貝文並保證英尙有充分力量，可使保護英屬洪都拉斯不受侵略。</p>
<p>〔路透社倫敦三日電〕英駐危地瑪拉公使，昨已向爲國外長提出照會，嚴辭抗議危地瑪拉城昨日所發生之不榮譽的事件。抗議書有云：昨日下午英使館前之示威，除將英旗卸下，懸起危國旗外，復將有骷髏圖樣之海盜旗懸於旗桿之上。</p>
<h3>英上院辯論外交　斥辦效法希魔威脅和平</h3>
<p>〔路透社倫敦三日電〕上議院三日舉行外交辯論，涉及蘇聯勢力在東歐之擴張及最近捷克芬蘭之事件。代表政府發言之巴耿漢勳爵以共黨之奪取捷克政權，喩希特勒之手段，認係預謀的行動。並曰芬蘭即將步其後塵，已遭死神的接吻。渠並曰，自最近事件可獲之敎訓之一，乃爲不論任何團體，無論其爲政府工會或任何其他機構，均不能容許共黨之參加，否則此等團體遲早將爲共黨所呑沒。反對然領袖薩里斯堡稱，蘇聯之政策已採取新的可怖方式，希特勒所具的個性，已在蘇聯決策者身上所發見，正如德國之併呑捷克侵略蘇聯。今日之蘇聯亦已囊括保·羅·捷·波·匈諸國。英國雖願與蘇維持良好關係，惟上週之事件已使其不容忽視再度籠罩全歐之威脅。今後之問題，不再爲避免歐洲之分裂，而爲防止東方之併呑西歐。令人興奮者乃爲英國之決定團結西歐，渠希望貝文外相能親赴比京以獲致迅述而有效的結果。前英政府首席外交顧問范西達亦日史達林已如希特勒之甘冒掀起歐洲戰火的危險，今後英國之親史達林，應以對希特勒之目光視之，而對與極權國所締之條約切不可妄事信任。捷克之事件應使幻想時期巳爲之結束。</p>

<h3>英蘇貿易協定　以武器換取食糧　英議員表示反對</h3>
<p>〔中央社倫敦三日合衆電〕英議員羅白生在下院稱，根據英蘇貿易及財政協定，英國將以戰爭武器送與蘇聯。渠稱，以重工業機器亦即戰爭武器購換生畜及其他食料代價宋免過高，如英洲各同盟國各自治領及各殖民地感覺吾人以戰爭潛在力供給除戰爭以外無所不爲之國家，吾人必大感不安。渠要求廢除此一協定。下院議員史多克亦反對此一協定，因英國不應與關閉一千七百萬至二千萬人民於奴役集中營之國家從事貿易。</p>
<h3>西歐捉襟見肘　亟待美援助</h3>
<p>美對英貸款已全部用罄</p>
<p>〔路透社華盛頓三日電〕美副國務卿洛維特今日在記者招待會中稱，西歐國家現已申由其所得動用之資金，國會有不於四月一日通過馬歇爾方案，西歐國家之財政狀况，將愈益艱難。法國之美元尤感缺乏，其他若干國亦均巳「豁邊」。</p>
<p>〔路透社華盛頓三日電〕美財政部今日宣布英國向美所貸三十七億五千萬元業已全部用，最後一筆一億元，係於本星期一獲取。該鉅額貸款原期得以維持三年至五年之久，結果於二十個月內即已用響。</p>
<h3>芬對蘇建議　最後態度待決定</h3>
<p>〔合衆社瑞典古城四日電〕芬蘭五個政黨可望於今晚決定其對蘇建議之立塲，然在五日前不致向總統提出答覆。</p>
<h3>中加反對美建議　支持比利時所提修正案　主張聖地局勢先付調查</h3>
<p>〔路透社成功湖三日電〕安理會今是開會由中國代表蔣廷黻輪値主席，與加拿大一致反對不待調査整個問題先行接受巴勒斯坦分治之原則。中國及加拿大均支持比利時所提之修正案，反對在美國所提之決議案中，不待充分調査巴勒斯坦局勢威脅和平之可能性，即行接受分治原則。加代表麥克諾登贊成任命安理會之咨詢委員會，並促五强以調處方法解決問題。中國代表蔣廷黻指出以武力執行分治及以武力維持和平，在法律上雖有效，然在現狀下恐難施行。蔣氏並相出美國立塲之矛盾，蓋美國一方向表示不擬以武力支持聯大分治決議，一方面則贊成安理會於必要時使用武力，以擊破對於國際和平的威脅。理事會旋宣布改期星期五續議。（按美國建議，蘇聯已在原則上表示接受，見昨電）</p>
<p>〔聯合社成功湖三日電〕中國與加拿大今日阻止美國促使安理會迅速批准巴勒斯坦分治計劃之嘗試。中加兩國表示五强應出以最大努力，協議解決巴勒斯坦問題。美首席代表奧斯汀之提議，不獲安理會批准實已定奪。</p>
<h3>美共和黨議員主張　軍事締盟對抗蘇聯　范登堡表示不予贊同</h3>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓四日電〕共和黨參議員威萊稱，對抗蘇聯之軍事同盟爲必須者，渠稱，由於蘇聯之使用否決權，聯合國因而停止其工作，我人應儘連設法。渠與鮈爾以及其他若干共和黨參議員均主張在必要時，以武力阻止「蘇聯之侵略程序表。」據稱，參院議員長范登堡認爲是項建議，將削弱西歐復興自助計劃，並或將危害聯合國之前途。鮑爾提案規定總統及國務卿立即與聯合國其他會員國開始談判，以組織新的十一國「最高理事會」，接管安理會現掌之維護和平權。參加「最高理事會」前，每國應預先保證，如十一國中七國，包括半數以上之大國，決議必須以武力維持和平時，該國應貢獻其軍隊。</p>
<h3>日本社會黨會商結果　決定片山不入閣　三黨首腦會議因此延期</h3>
<p>〔新亞社東京四日電〕竹田國務相受民主黨總戰蘆田之意旨，四日午前訪問社會黨委員長片山，邀請出席四日之三黨黨首會談，同時墾其入閣任外務大臣之前提下，蒞臨三黨黨首會談，但片山對此，答以保留至九日再行答覆。惟下午二時，蘆田總裁及竹田又與片山會見，邀請其入閣任外務大臣，而片山固辭，會談後，社會黨即召開中央執行委員會，就片山入閣問題，協議之結果，無一人贊成者，而決議由片山以外之人士參加蘆田內閣，予以協力。因此片山再訪問蘆田，答以不能入閣。</p>
<p>竹田則發表稱：「爲安定目前之政局，社會黨首片山之入閣，絕對必要，故決定五日蘆田首相再訪問片山，再行懇請」。因此，預定四日召開之社會·民主·國協三黨黨首會談延期至五日。</p>
<p>〔中央社東京四日電〕預料片山拒絕參與者內閣，將使蘆田失去一大部安定力量。</p>
<p>〔新亞社東京四日電〕日吉田派所組織之保守新黨籌備會，近日因蘆田內閣政策協定巳吿成功，故更積極進行組織工作，準備將來在國會中對蘆田內閣提出不信任案，或要求解散國會重行選舉。聞昨日該籌備會已將黨綱黨紀及政策等項擬就，再數次會商決定黨名後，即可於十五日舉行成立大會矣。</p>

<h3>赫爾回憶録　（十）（四）</h3>
<p>— 北美報業聯合會版權所有　本報編譯室</p>
<p>懷念故舊真令人不勝滄桑</p>
<p>一九四四年七月二十日，當羅斯福在芝加哥被提名竸選第四任總統之前一些時候，他在白宮又建議將我提名為副總統。他說他知道假如我願意的話，我是可以獲得提名的。</p>
<p>但是總統知道我是不會接受的，因爲戰爭尙在進行之中而我是埋首於外交工作中之故。猶如我在一九四〇年間屢次拒絕類似的建議一般，我覺得在這種情形之下，我担任國務卿可以比担任副總統貢獻多些。我對於總統的盛意表示感激，但是說我正專心致志於外交政策，並不覺得可以亂開它。</p>
<p>第四任對於大衆包括我自己在內似乎比第三任來得更自然些。傳統是已經被破壞了。</p>
<p>在一九四四年間，我們是正在作戰，而在一九四〇年却並不如此。總統覺得局勢困難，我們彷彿在汪洋大海之中，他是掌着舵。所以他應該對普遍的要求讓步，再度參加競選。</p>
<p>在其後的競選運動中，我並未參與其事。</p>
<p>總統送給我一個備忘錄，日期是一九四四年九月二十九日，其中他說：「我非常希望你訂定計劃的時候，能够在現在和選舉日之間設法廣播演說兩次。全國需要你這種清晰的思想，並且需要始終不落後。」</p>
<p>他於是說他想在當時和選舉日之間就外交政策發表一篇演說，假如我能够替他起草，他將「永遠非常感激」。</p>
<p>當我接到這個備忘錄的時候，我已經準備在下一個星期日到白宮去訪問總統，並且通知他我將辭職了。我照預定的日期去訪問他，並且在一種極深刻的失望情緒中吿訴總統說，我已經勉力相當時光，現在我發現我的健康情形是如此，不得不辭職了。我說我將在下一二天內離開辦公室，直跑到床上去，而必須留在那裏，不知要多久。</p>
<p>總統似乎不肯相信我。在我離開他辦公室之前，我們相當隨便地談了一番。替他準備演說稿以及我發表兩篇競選演說的問題，當時和此後都沒有提到，雖然國務院後來是協助總統準備他競選中的主要外交政策演說的。</p>
<p>三天之後，十月二日，也就是我七十三歲誕辰，我離開國務院，已是一個百病叢生的人。我在公寓中過了十八天，努力想復元而終歸無效。在這一時期中，我繼續做一部份工作，其後我就被送到瑪澤萊州員賽斯達地方的海軍醫院去，而在那裏留了大約七個月，有時候病情極爲嚴重。在國務院將近十二年中的驚人緊張情形，使我完全精乏力盡，因爲當時適値我國生命中最嚴重時期之一，而歷史上任何一個國務卿的任期，甚至沒有我一半的任期那樣長的。</p>
<p>在抵達醫院不久之後，總統派白宮的醫師麥克英蒂爾海軍中將來診斷，我的病情，並且使我相信在一個合理的時間內，我可以充份復元恢復任職。於是總統來訪我，留了一個半鈾點，當時他力促我以不辭職爲上策。他保證我可以諸假若干時日，並且在一個合理的時問之後，回到國務院的辦公室去。</p>
<p>我毫不猶豫而是迅速地表示不願意不辭職。我說在我全神貫注的龐大計劃尙未被採用面被迫辭職，其痛苦僅次於要我的生命。但是我又說爲了推行這些巨大的努力，我幾乎把我的精力消耗凈盡了，在我體力之梯上，我巳被挫至最低的一級。我說我不能一方面繼續任職負起其非常的責任而一方面又想恢復健康。</p>
<p>總統於是竭力敦促我不要辭職，直到他現在的一任於一九四五年一月二十日任滿之後。我回答說，就我個人講，我是極度樂於這樣做法，但是我指出假如我如此辦了，批評家幾乎立即會注意到落在我和國務院身上的重大責任，而會一方面對我的疾病表示同情，而另一方面不久就會堅持一點，就是當前情形的緊急性質，需要一個國務卿坐正在國務院中，結果他們就會批評總統處置失當的。</p>
<p>羅斯福先生於是要求暫時不要辭職，至少等到選舉之後。對於這一點，我是同意了。</p>
<p>十一月二十一日，總統寫給我一封精彩的信，開頭他說我的信「使我左右為難」。他繼續說，「我們十二年來密切相處即將結東，就是想到這一點，也使我極爲難受。這不僅是爲了我們的關係一向是極和陸，或者我們的聯合工作在如此許多方面已經獲得了成功，而是更爲了我個人的感情，就是說從今以後我將不能再依賴你的帮助和你親切交換意見了。</p>
<p>「我特別感覺如此者，乃是因爲在國際間友好關係之路上我們已經走得如此之遠，我是極想靠你的帮助，在當前依然是極複雜困難的情形之下，把這種工作在其最後階段獲得貫澈。</p>
<p>「你的健康，的確是最關心的，並且我眞正相信你是可以在比較短的時間中恢復過來，縱使將來你可以限於從事特殊的工作而避免國務院方面的日常事務。所以今日，你必須把全部思想集中於早獲康復，對於這一點，所有你的朋友都會一起來帮助你的。」</p>
<p>他於是重覆他的建議，就是說要我繼續習職，直到第四任開始，他說：</p>
<p>「假如你一定要這樣做的話，我當然是會接受你國務卿的辭呈的。但是我希望你同意一種變通辦法，就是允許我在一月二十日我們第三任期結東的時候，加以接受。或許這其間稍爲有一點感情作用在內，但是假如我們能够完成第三任期，將使我衷心快慰。這就是說還有二個月的時間，而在這個時間我可以時常來看你，並且就我們可能碰到的若干事情，聽取你的意見。」</p>
<p>總統於是提出一個建議，而這個建議，假如我能够予以接受的話，的確是在我的心上是最親切的。他說，「我附帶講起，當聯合國機書成立之時，我將繼續祈求作爲聯合國之父的你，能够在它第一屆會議中担任主席。這與此時你是否還是國務卿一點毫無關係，而命份中應該由你來担任，因爲你是全世界中使此一偉大和平計劃成爲具體事實貢獻最大的人。你曾在如此許多不同方面對國際間的友好關係具有貢獻，所以縱使你已經不在政府機關中任職，你將繼續以你的道德指示帮助世界」。</p>
<p>他用關切的說話結束了這封信。</p>
<p>總統的懇請是如此打動我的心，使我的確和爲我診療的醫生，懇切的談過一次話。他們的答覆是在未來長時間中我不可能回到我的辦公室去。所以我認爲接受總統的建議留職到一月二十日，無論對政府或者對我自己都不是公允的。一個新的國務卿應該被任命來接替我。並且我覺得作爲國務院的首腦，我是應該負外交政策之責的，而我在這些政策的訂定方面，却不積極參與其事。</p>
<p>所以我在十一月二十三日答覆總統，告訴他說我爲他的來信深深感動，對於他懇切地關懷我的健康以及對於十二年間我們私人和官方密切關係的稱道，將永遠感激。在重申中我的健康情形使我不能繼續担任公務這種個人的悲劇以及將永遠珍視我們之間的友誼和深情之後，我說：</p>
<p>「我衷心希望能够滿足你的願望，就是說我辭去國務卿可以不在現在而在一月二十日生效。我曾經再和我的醫師商量過。我恢復的速度肯定地和避免一切担心和責任相關聯。你一定能够理解在我担任國務卿一日，我就不能把國務卿的重任撥諸一旁。爲了忠於你和我一向從事的目標，忠於國家，忠於你以及忠於我自己，我覺得我的辭職必須在現在生效」，</p>
<p>我重覆說，一俟我的健康恢復，我將完全聽命你的指揮，凡是對於將來重大問題的解決我個人能够有所貢獻的，無不樂於從事。</p>
<p>總統現在接受了我的辭呈，而於十一月二十七日加以宣佈。他任命副國務卿史坦蒂紐斯繼承我。我的任期於一九四四年十一月三十日正式結東，</p>
<p>總統到醫院來看過我幾次。有一次，他的神情看上去非常疲勞——當時他離開死期祗有幾星期的時間了——我睡在床上，他對我說，「我應該在你在的地方」。</p>
<p>在我留於醫院中的冗長的七個月中，我時常爲種種徵象而感到欣奮，那就是我雖然巳經不復在職，我的工作並沒有被遺忘。</p>
<p>我從雅爾達會議接到一個由羅斯福，史達林，邱吉爾，莫洛托夫，艾登和史坦蒂紙斯簽字的電報，其中說：「我們在這一次會議中沒有你在一起，謹向你懇切致候。我們希望你迅速康復，因此我們大家再能和你相處在一起」。</p>
<p>我在這裏應該說明在雅爾達會議之前或在會議期間，總統或任何人對於政策問題並沒有和我商量過。當總統剛要啓程赴雅爾達之前，他到醫院來看我，但是並沒有和我提起他預期和史達林與邱吉爾討論的任何題目或者他可能作的任何決定。在此後任何其他重要會議中我國政府的目的，我事前也沒有被通知過，惟舊金山會議爲例外。</p>
<p>雅爾達會議二個月之後，我於四月十二日爲羅斯福總統的突然逝世所怔呆。他在赴海德公園其後赴喬治亞溫泉之前一天，他來看過我。幾天之後，他就在那裏逝世了。在他這一次來看我的時候，我勸他注意健康，說他應該多休息休息。他說他在下一天要離開這裏，就爲這個目的。</p>
<p>在我看來，羅斯福總統是我們現代史上最偉大的社會改革家，縱使有許多人對於他若干改革可能不表同意。作爲總司令，他的成就在其他總司令的成就中是出衆的。根據我的意見，他在政治的技巧方面，當代並無匹敵。據我所知，他一直是個人自由以及其他基本權利和特權的誠懇的信徒，這些權利對於一般公民是必要的。這些包括正義，法律和秩序的理想。在見解方面，他堅强，一貫並且時常是極端自由主義的。他在軍事方面所採取的步驟，使我們直往勝利，同時這種步驟，在外交方面也具有最大的意義，因爲軍事上的成功，給予我們的外交以不可或缺的支持和力量。</p>

<h3>參議大會決議　請停辦牲畜市塲　暫緩執行禁舞令</h3>
<p>臨時動議擁戴主席爲首任大總統　提請致電美國朝野實施全面援華</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕昨日爲市參議會五次大會之第十日，下午舉行第八次會議，繼續討論關於民政，社會及工務之提案。該會原定昨日休會，茲因討倫提案衆多，決定延期兩天，至明日下午七時休會。</p>
<p>該會潘議長，徐副議長及參議員高叔安，楊公謀（民社黨），王興國（靑年黨）等四十五人，昨聯名提出臨時提案「擬請大會一致擁戴國民政府主席蔣公爲首任大總統」案，將於今日　請大會決議。又武漢行營主任程潛頃致函市參議會，亦請響應擁戴蔣公爲首任大總統，原函云：「大選期近，我總裁蔣公領導革命，安內攘外，豐功偉烈，鑠古震今，今後戡亂建國，任重道遠，總統一職，天子人歸，雖公一日萬機，不遑競選，而我全國民意，宜有表示。鄂省各民意機關，以定期開會，專電出席代表，一致擁戴，貴市人士，必同此心，務希領導各界全體，一致響應爲盼」。</p>
<p>此外，復有議長，副議長及參議員王維駰等十四人臨時動議案稱：「齊共匪破壞國家統一，阻礙復興大計，此一問題之嚴　，不僅關係中國一國之安危，抑且影響遠東之和平。吾政府當此嚴軍時機，，固宜刷新政治，改善經濟，整飭軍事，力圖振奮，以期迅速戡平匪亂。但吾國於長期抗戰之後，國力疲憊，民生困苦，不得不向盟邦呼籲援助。近日報載美國政府，雖已提出經濟援華方案，但猶在討論過程之中，而且並不包含軍事援助，於中國大局，仍屬緩不濟急。本會代表全市市民，除一面向吾政府督促從速實施政治經濟財政軍事之澈底改革外，一面宜本人民立塲，致電美國朝野，對全面援華，萬勿再事覊延，迅以有效辦法，立付實施，俾我國得穩定經濟，加强軍事，掃蕩匪氛，恢復建設，而與吾盟邦，共負防止人類戰禍，確保世界永久和平之使命是否有當，敬祈公決。「本案亦將於今日大會中決定。</p>

<p>關於禁舞問題　大會決議二點</p>
<p>（二）關於收回禁舞成命案，張志韓張中原等，又再請市府將前次大會決議案呈請中央。社會局吳局長開先亦一再說明如果中央無表示，決不自動執行。該案原提案爲「請嚴懲搗毁社會局主使暴徒，開釋無辜，並請收回禁舞成命，以弘法治，而安善良」。經大會決議三點：（一）函請政府對實施搗毁社會局暴徒，應依法嚴辦，對其罪嫌不足者迅予開釋。（二）査在此戡亂時期，安定第一，上海舞　歷史悠久，從業人員衆多，直接間接賴以生活者不下十餘萬人，與其他各都市情形又確有不同之處，故在舞廳職工及舞女轉業問題未能妥爲解決以前，仍應依照上次大會決議，函請市府轉呈中央暫緩執行。（三）函請市府轉令社會局在未接得中央新指示前，對已未中籖之舞廳暫緩執行命令。</p>

<h3>山東婦女立委精選聲中　鴛譜插曲　「髪妻」指夫犯重婚罪　兒子否認母親在人間</h3>
<p>〔本報濟南一日航訊〕山東省立法委員選舉的結果，直到記者　管寫本文時，尙未經省選所正式公佈。但由於選舉所引起的料葛，也就够五花八門，層出不窮。這裏所談的是由於現任魯敎廳長夫人陳久敬女士以社會賢達身份參加山東省婦女團體立委競選後所牽連到他的丈夫李廳長泰華的髮妻問題，這在濟南已一致被公認爲最曲折也是最複雜的選舉糾紛，而問題旣牽涉到一個廳長的「重婚」（？）自然也就成了最重要的社會新聞了。</p>
<p>口口聲聲　我的丈夫</p>
<p>事情的經過是首先在二月廿四日南京救國日報登載了由「李楊氏「具名的「山東敎育廳長犯了重婚罪」。原文如下：「我的丈夫，他姓李名泰華，現任山東省政府敎育廳長，我隨夫在這抗戰八年之間艱苦奔波度歲月，在卅一年春，我丈夫李泰華便變了心，與一女子陳久敬姘居。從此，我丈夫的態度，及一切的一切，都改變了。勝利後，何主席當山束主席，李泰華便榮長敎廳，我丈夫恐社會人士用暗示的眼光瞧他，於去歲便到天津秘密的結婚。我丈夫曾數次的對我用恐嚇的手段，說不讓我向外聲張，我便忍受痛苦與我婆母寄居在親戚家中，只住了一間破屋，現在我的婆母生病，他未曾到他親生母的家中去看過一次，就醫無錢，只有靠友人帮助。我的丈夫他每天在他的姘婦陳久敬的住所，就是齊魯大學內的一所洋房，使用人老媽子，勤務等多人伺候，他的親生母，他也不關了，別說是他的髮妻，這次，我的丈夫又讓他的姘婦競選什麽立法委員，我的丈夫拿自已的勢力讓各縣來支持姘婦陳久敬，我丈夫以私人的名義勢力讓各縣長包給多多少票，我丈夫的所做所爲，我實在看不下去，我實在忍到頭了，呼籲　一下，讓全國人都知道知道，李楊氏叩。</p>
<p>緊急啟事　聲明離婚</p>
<p>接着，李廳長及其子志韶於廿九日起在魯省府機關報山東新報登着下列啓事：</p>
<p>李泰華緊急啟事</p>
<p>頃閱二月二十四日南京救國日報內載：「山東敎育廳長犯了重婚罪」報導一則，不勝驚異之至。查本人與元配楊氏以感情不洽，於民國十八年夏間經雙方親友楊良譜韓天鎭（此二人現均在濟南，）等從中協議，同意離婚，所有全部家產盡歸楊氏主有，所生一子李志韶，則完全由本人負責敎養，卅二年秋間，楊氏以染虎疫棄世，今竟有人假借名義，揑造事實，揆其用心，當在破壞內子陳久敬參加立法委員之競選，固不僅汚辱本人之名　而已也。除向該報更正外，特此鄭重聲明，以正視聽。</p>
<p>李志韶緊急啟事</p>
<p>頃閱二月廿四日南京救國口報內載：「山東敎育應長犯了重婚罪」新聞一則，不勝駭異。査家父李泰華與先生母楊氏經雙方親友協議，於一民國十八年夏間離婚，卅二年秋問先母以染虎疫東世，該報所戰皆係他人胃名捏造，事關家父及繼母名譽，特此聲明，以正視聽。</p>
<p>呂參政員　表示驚異</p>
<p>這兩個啓事刊出後，至第二天，此間各報都登出了中央婦女運動委員會副主任委員兼國民參政會參政員呂雲章女士所寄新聞一則，內容如下：「女參政員呂雲章頃閱二月廿九日山東新報載有李廳長泰華及其子李志韶啓事二則，謂李應長夫人李楊氏早已亡故，殊深驚異，緣雲章二月十六日因病赴經二路緯六路四百四十五號呂醫生處就醫，偶談及公務員之淸苦情形，呂醫生無意說出李廳長太夫人李劉氏及夫人李楊氏均住於本院樓下，號爲連長之母妻生活亦極困苦，其太夫人生病無錢治療，均由呂　生純盡義務等情，足證明李廳長之天人李楊氏確尙健在，似此負敎育重任之　長竟有此等不孝不義之行爲，量篤孝之王主席當有以處理也，」　究竟李廳長髮妻是否仍在人間？李應長是否與髮妻正式離婚？由於呂參政員一封書，使若千人皆如墮五里霧中，而有待今後事實的發展來證明。不過，有一點一可以附帶說明的，就是根據各方面的可靠估計，李夫人陳久敬，此次參加山東婦女團體立委競選，省選所雖尙未公佈結果，但陳女士的當選，似乎大家都認爲已沒有問題。問題是在陳女士以社會　達的身份當選爲立委後，民·靑·兩黨的候選人票數雖少，但中央早有規定，概可不讓，而一倒露的是國民黨候選人呂雲章·一王雋英。　寳琳三人中勢必有一人必須「讓賢」。</p>
<h3>魯教廳長李泰華　髪妻之謎</h3>
<p>〔本報濟南四日電〕關於魯敎廳長李泰華重婚之謎，自山東新報刊出住於經二緯六路四四五號李楊氏，係邱縣李維恒之孀妻，而非李泰華之髮妻後，四日此間大華日報，復刊出參政員呂雲章之談話，謂該「李楊氏確係李泰華髮妻，如否認時，可親來對證，是非即可大白。」該報記者旋又訪李楊氏及李母李劉氏，（據同院人云李楊氏李劉氏已被公務員模樣之人接去，不知何往。）似此衆所矚目之李泰華　長重婚案，其謎底短期恐仍無法揭曉也。　〔又電〉轟動濟市之魯敎廳長李泰華「重婚之謎」，頃又有新發展，即女參政員呂雲章前指住經二緯六路四四五號之李楊氏係李泰華之髮妻，但據此間省府機關報山東新報三日載該報取訪：該四四五號東院劉屛軒先生談話，則謂：「李楊氏確有其人，即爲我之表嫂，至於是李廳長的髮妻，這簡直對舍親是一種汚辱，我的表哥李維恒早已過世，怎麽我的表嫂還會再有丈夫？』但該報於結語中又謂：『究竟眞相如何，尙有待於州未來之事實證明。」故誠如該報標題所謂「是誰亂點鴛鴦譜，撲朔迷離費猜詳」了。按李泰華現有夫人，係陳久敬女士，川籍，美國留學生，與李結婚尙僅年餘。此次從夫勸，以社會　達身份參加魯婦女立委競選，據訊得票甚多，於是此間，遂紛傳此次李泰華事件即導原於其妻從事立委競選而發生者。</p>

<p>〔本報鄭州廿七日航訊〕鄭州廿六日發生一哄動全市謀財害命放火滅跡之驚人慘案，悲劇主角第五軍九十四旅砲乒營上尉附員之妻郭玲玉，年二十五歲，四川人，兇手爲此間農行點票員孫治祥，年廿五歲，洛陽人，數小時內，案破，其間情形頗曲折。下午一時許，劉萬順街十三號正誼花行內，發生火警，當時風大火猛，勢極可怖，但幸發覺尙早，消防隊施救得力，得未釀成巨災，且將在火塲上之一婦女及年甫十六月之女孩救出。不料於整理火塲時，突發覺此一被救出婦女，鼻被割掉，右眼珠被砍凸出，左眼亦爲濃血所封，臉形無法辨認，咽喉被刀傷兩處，均深寸許，左手斷兩指，右手傷五處，共計刀傷二十餘處，全身血跡糢糊，慘不忍睹。本市警刑隊長洪鳴皋據報後，向被害者之同住女客周照平及其小叔孫治祥問訊，未獲後索，及後將此兩人帶隊續訊。據周供稱：現年十九歲，四川人，三年前嫁與新五軍第九十六旅挺進隊副官孫治年爲妻，因夫開赴前綫工作，故與夫同事張隨福之妻郭玲玉同住，感情甚好，並有叔孫治祥在鄂農行任職，時來探望，早晨去找孫治祥有事，後又到一位劉太太家裏閑　，第五軍熊副官跑來，才知郭被殺，趕快回去。訊至孫只是搖搖頭，說不知道。後在其藍布條布棉抱衣角下，袖口上發現血跡，又於棉袍後襟上發現一帶着血跡的長頭髮。孫始供認：死者郭玲玉，有金子二兩，金項練一個，金圈一只，寳石戒指一個，日前曾將金項圈（重九分）賣掉，交孫一千萬元，託存銀行內生息，被其化了，又因春節賭輸兩千萬元，無法補還。其嫂廿六日至銀行向其　款兩次。一時被迫無法，至郭處將其殺死，並將二兩餘金飾取走，放火以　滅跡。</p>

<p>〔本報無錫二日電〕蘇州洞庭東山鄕十三保七甲七戶居民徐連元，年二十二歲，家境貧困，向以販賣水菓爲業，娶妻陸氏，本地人，婚後感情彌篤，惟述元生性好賭，於本年新正，屢賭屢敗，致虧空甚鉅，自知無法彌補，適聞本邑各鄕鎭，需要征募志願兵，乃托友顧洪生，介紹至縣屬南鄉新安鎭充當志願兵，言明安家費四千四百萬元，由專事販賣壯丁之徐金寳，孫阿大經手，立據成交，詎孫徐兩人，均爲無業遊民，得款後，祇以一千四百萬元交與連元，備帶應用，餘均飽入私囊。　連元自送入惠山無錫團管區司令部後，經被編入新兵第四中隊服役，因不　軍隊生活，且思及背家離妻之痛苦，頗覺懊悔，遂商諸原介紹人徐金寳，願將所得之安家費，全部璧還，再行買丁頂替，當經雙方同意，進行掉換，終因體格不合，未成　實，連元無法，即乘開拔赴滬受訓時，逃逸無踪。　事發後，當局即着保追尋，經介紹人徐金寳，會同新安鎭鎭長張洪烈等，四出　覓，於上月二十日，將連元之妻陸氏，以欺騙手腕謂：汝夫在團管區生話甚好，連日賭博大贏，有金戒三只，急待交付，以作家中開支，遲則恐不及晤面云云，陸氏信以爲眞，跟同來鎭，當時即被金寳禁閉於，公園路新亞飯店，至深夜十一時許，復由金寳領一陌生男子名小唐者至臥室，口稱調解，迫令陸氏至附近公園飯店細談，小唐亦以威脅手段，將陸氏姦宿，從此數日間，又被介紹人等連續姦汚，並由徐之姘婦，以賠償損失爲名，强取陸氏耳環，同時復勒拍陸氏，書立筆據，保證賠償新安鎭公所損失二百萬元。　上月底在逃之徐連元，經陳鎭長尋獲，送往縣府刑　隊寄押，由該隊通知陸氏，遂得自由，夫妻相會，互訴別後衷腸，連元聞悉乃妻被騙情形，不禁大怒，乃囑陸氏報吿縣府，請將徐金寳等兵販，拘案法辦，二日中午十二時，縣府黄秘書，即密派政警二名，按址前往，至新亞飯店十五號，將徐金寳及小唐（原名瑞泉）兩名拘獲，並査獲繩索及販丁證明書等大批犯罪證件，一併帶縣。規縣府以此輩兵役掮客，顯有威脅勒　欺詐行爲，自應嚴予懲辦，以廠傚尤，而爲社會除害。</p>

<h3>巢湖灌域　羽毛產銷堅挺</h3>
<p>〔本報徽州二月廿七日航訊〕家萬的羽毛，用途很廣，除作衣褥外，且可製成裝飾等品。我國羽毛的生產極富，而尤以上海，漢口，九龍，蕪湖四埠爲羽毛最大的集散市塲。　蕪市所產鷄鴨毛，雖不　滬產之豐，惟鵝毛則又過之。因爲巢湖灌域的農戶，對於養鵝　業，別有心得，所出的鵝毛，絨厚而光澤。戰前　市輸出鵝毛，曾佔國際貿易的重要地位，一九二八年輸出鷄毛二九五担，値　　　四·〇〇〇兩，鴨毛九·　　　担，値二〇七，〇〇〇兩，　　　六·一一三担，値二二八·〇〇〇兩。迨後，毛商因利取巧，攙揉渣粉，降低信用與品格，促成逐年輸額的减退。抗戰期內，日人在蕪搜集物資，最被注意的，是羽毛和菜籽二種。　近兩年巢湖灌域及靑弋江各地，羽毛出產，依然豐厚。農戶對家禽的飼養，興趣還比以前增高。因鷄鴨鵝和蛋，價値抬漲，都把禽蛋和羽毛，列爲補助家庭生活副產的收益。　現在，產區的家禽和蛋市價，非常俏貴，雞鴨鵝每市斤普售三萬至四萬，蛋價每枚二千五至三千，羽毛因質量輕鬆，鵝羽一市斤，須集鵝毛數十隻，方够稱算，鷄鴨則倍之。上年冬天裏，爲羽毛旺銷季節，各路交易，突呈堅俏，英莊銷胃，亦漸增强，特號鷄鴨毛，每百斤提漲至一八〇萬，特號鵝毛，每百二六〇萬，冀市羽毛出口前途，今後已呈有好轉的新生機。（記者　寗頗）</p>

<h3>杭北水菓鄉　塘棲之春　五步一梅　十里聞香</h3>
<p>〔本報杭州三日訊〕塘棲離杭州六十里，是浙江的水菓王國，盛產櫻桃。枇杷，梅。杏。桃。甘蔗等物，遠近馳名。由於大量種檙果樹，春花開起來也特別多，尤其是梅花的盛放，蔚爲壯觀，所謂塘棲卅里「香雪海」，五步一梅，十里聞香，曾風糜了多少詩人詞客，陶醉了多少愛之士！今年花汛，記者剛巧趕上盛季，所以雖是陰霾的天氣，遠道而去的遊客還是很多，而且都是懷着歡忭的心情去迎春的。度過了漫長的冬季，即使是陰霾的春天也很可愛了。　汽車直開到超山的丘陵地帶，迎來一羣天眞而雅拙的孩子們，他們都是</p>
<p>小響導</p>
<p>正爲有錢可賺而嬉笑着。據他們說，每人也可賺到三五萬元錢一天。這在山鄕，却是一宗不太小的收入了。其實，超山的風景很簡單，不用嚮導也自己找得到。一下車，淸香就隨微風撲鼻送來，眼前就是一片香雪海——說得正確點，該是「香雪湖」。國色清香，展露眼前，身不由主，自然會跟蹤尋芳。在這個迷人的「香雪湖」中，宋梅亭莊然而立，像海島，像湖礁，身在宋梅亭中，不獨可以樓　四顧，細心賞花，而　　　見到亭前蒼勁的古宋梅。她是歷盡滄桑，而堅强地活下來釣；現在雖有人工的保護，而她仍茁長思放，不輸於年靑的後輩，這種精神，也正是中華民族的立國精神，見了宋梅，益使我愛我們的國花了。由</p>

<p>左有名畫家吳昌碩先生墓，墓旁有吳氏石像，前則樹碑，鐫「缶老講藝圖」，古樸有緻。去報慈寺上山，還有二寺，高居峯顚，環境幽美，但已無花。沿途則三三兩兩，東叢西藪，淸芳四溢；去超山七八里，有龍洞，至此登高一望，所謂卅里香雪海，即呈現眼下微風起處，香　上湧，確有海的壯觀，海的浩漫，置身其中，直疑身在天堂，不想再回到地上的「天堂」——杭州去了。　遊客愛花，山農却愛果；成天生活在</p>
<p>大自然</p>
<p>中的人，他們並不重視自然的美，而只重視自然的產物，利用自然的機能。果樹開了花，結成實，他們才心裏開心。把幾百担幾千担的水菓從水路運到外鄕去，帶回來的是塘樓的財富。塘棲在戰前確是富庶，安樂的水　桃源，但是苦難的戰爭耗盡了塘棲的財富。今日塘棲鎭上房子還是那麽　次櫛比以舟代步下雨天上街是是不用帶雨傘穿雨衣；但這祗是外表吧了。內裏的空虛和苦經，一時還看不出，但是有一點，很可以看到：戰前塘棲有緣廠五家，現在僅存崇裕一家了；就是這一家也靠中國農民銀行來貸欲維持，外銷的出產是大大地衰落了。至於內銷的水菓，名產之一的枇杷，今　因爲天時的打擊，收成將要减少很多，農民正爲此苦惱着。商民呢？也有他們的苦腦，最逼切的是房子問題。</p>
<p>商聯會</p>
<p>的負責人施子文告訴記者，塘　四百餘家商舖，十九都是租屋開店，而房東只不過五·六人。這些屋主心很狠，每間店面的屋租每月要收三担白米，二間的就要五·六祖一月。如不照付，「收回自用」。借着屋荒的機會，房主心要漁肉商民，因此，特組成了商民聯合會去共同對付房主，以求得合理的居住條件。這件事，正和成千成萬的房子糾紛一樣，緊扣着千萬人民的心，他們盼望政府在這方面應爲多數的房客主持公道。　盛放的梅花首先帶來了春的音訊，塘棲——這水菓之鄉的春天是　常令人羡慕的；但塘樓的人民不祗希望梅化帶來了春天，他們更希望春天帶來塘樓的財富，——收的水菓和合理的生活條件，以便恢復他們的元氣。他們帶着微笑送去了冬天，現在，他們以同樣的微笑來迎接春天了。（本　記者黄行天）</p>

<h3>市上籌碼短少客幫競進　棉紗布繼續勝漲　四二支藍鳳細紗再升五百萬</h3>
<p>昨日棉紗市况，因上日紡建公司配售不多，籌碼不敷需求，客路津粤等帮，辦意仍濃，四十二支藍鳳細紗，複製廠商乘低收吸仍健，價昂至一億三千萬關。迨至收市，回至一億二千七百萬元，較之上日續漲五百萬元。金城及水月亦升六百萬左右。四上支紗僅藍鳳軋高五百萬外，其他平定。三十二支紗榮辱互見。</p>
<p>廿一支現雙馬紗，廣帮　運費即將調整，又因船期關係，吸力甚强，一見有賣即進，行情飛騰至七千八百五十萬之新高盤後，再升四百萬元，棧單亦秀四百萬許。十六支粗紗因去化呆滯，市呈供過於求，大都軋低八九十萬至二百萬左右。</p>
<p>棉布市况，以花紗行情飛揚，客帮因裝運水脚價漲倍餘，市面雖與內地倒懸，北帮及粤漢客商咸抱執貨主義，搶運出口。本街布商因現籌碼不豐，亦相綱競進，龍頭細布一路抬高至二百八十萬元。嗣以獲利散戶乘高出籠，回至二百七十七萬元，比上日再漲七萬，其他各細布亦升五萬至十萬元。</p>
<p>四君子嗶嘰各方收吸甚殷，激升至二百六十九萬，後以中紡公司開售，頓吿回低，收市爲二百六十五萬元，結果與金蓮妙舞同漲八萬元。此外直貢漂布細斜及元布高檔士林布等，均挺秀逾恒</p>
<p>紡建售紗</p>
<p>〔本報訉〕中國紡建公司，昨代紗管會在紗業公會售紗，共售四五七件，准購單共九九張。開價計廿一支金雙馬七四〇〇萬元，廿支好做七二〇〇萬元，公字七一〇〇萬元，雙喜六八五〇萬元，五子六八〇〇萬元，金虎六九五〇萬元，紅蜂，新三多，六七〇〇萬元，金元寳六七五〇萬元。</p>

<h3>進出口商公會　召開緊急會議　研討討海關處分到貨問題</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕據悉：最近江海關方面，曾發出處分書數百張，根據江海關第一八七號布吿，處分對於已到上海遲未報關之貨，宣吿沒收。聞此項處分，與該原公吿頗多出入之處，本市進出口商同業公會，迭接同業報吿，前晚特舉行臨時緊急會議，計到會者有壽景偉張耀章，華洪濤，陳懋勛，浦亮疇，李華卿，馬仲達等多人，當將此事分數點詳細硏究。認爲江海關此項處分，恐係失於檢討法令，及各部分不能相互聯絡所致，經一致議決推派代表，擬向海關據理辯訴，將此種不合法令之處分，迅予撤銷云。</p>
<h3>限制投機性工廠　新廠應暫緩設立</h3>
<p>工商輔導處，爲限制投機性之工廠設立，特擬具審核辦法，呈請經部核示。茲悉：該處業已奉到指令，核示如次：（一）査投機性之工廠，實有限制之必要，所擬新設工廠申請限額外匯條件三項：）甲。有最新式機器之設備，乙。配合新式技術之訓練，丙。生產與國防民生有關之優良成廠。）核尙可行，惟已設立之工廠，亦應受此條件之限制，至新廠設立一節，應暫緩議。</p>
<p>（二）嗣後各工廠申請再分配時，應飭提出已得原料所製成品之確實證件，予以審核。</p>
<p>（三）限額分配，原爲外匯不足臨時採用之辦法，政府旣有此種措施，對於成品價格，續作有效之控制，使原料價格低之成品，售價不得過高，而免原料與成品之價格相差懸殊。如此則原料流入黑市，可自根絕，應再妥擬辦法呈核爲要。</p>
<h3>人絲回堅　綢貨續挺</h3>
<p>人造絲昨市先疲後昂，卒較上日升起四百萬元。一二〇號旭字及金三馬有光，上午開盤降至四千四百萬元，旋因廠絲高昂，人心漸振，中午收盤升至五千萬元隔日期，下午最大價爲二百萬元，牧盤爲一百萬元。</p>
<p>廠經昨市再告進展，C字等級有二張單子成交，價做八千萬元。高零担七千六七百萬元，中級零担四五百萬元，共有十餘包交易。其餘各級喊價，均較上日大起八百萬元之譜。干經特上零担，昨有二担成交，價高達五千萬元。</p>

<h3>受運輸漲價影響　食米喊價又高</h3>
<p>昨日米市，晨開即挺，後市稍回，因聞車運航運均將於今日起上漲，是則成本加重，且因上日錫價高昂，貨主更竭力喊高，晨市各擋曾挺十五萬元。但戶口米已開始發售，本街門銷因是頗呆，市塲走化亦受影響。况昨日到貨較多，南北二市共有一萬一千二百七十一石，遂吿難支，市面中途即吿步退。北市塲特高粳一度曾喊高至三百萬外，收市爲三百萬大關，白粳二百九十萬。薄稻南市二百八十五萬，北市二百九十萬，各升十萬元。蕪湖機秈二百六十五萬，白元北市塲價重達三百萬。</p>
<p>麺粉續漲</p>
<p>麺粉因米市挺升，及內地價昂，廠方開少等原因，貨主扳持。老車粉開盤爲一百三十四萬，後市一百三十三萬。兵船以一百三十三萬開市，後爲一百三十二萬，各升四五萬元，二者交易均少。紅蜂及建成交易比較熱鬧，蓋紅蜂及建成獨多皮球交易也。二者價格亦較上日升四五萬元。麩皮因上日廠方開出甚多，呈平疲之態，小麥仍爲一百八十五萬</p>
<p>雜糧盤旋</p>
<p>雜糧價格無巨額上落，黃豆晨開賣買雙方擯持，一要上升賣出，一要克低買進，結果價與上日相仿。漢口乍豆爲一百五十萬元至一百五十五萬元，一百四十五萬元。菉豆苞米略挺五萬元，紅糧盤小五萬元。芝蔴·白蔴去銷呆疲，漢口白蔴開三百〇八萬元，微挫二萬元，而奶蔴黄蔴反見上升五萬至七萬元，元蔴委曲已久，昨市猛跳三四十萬元，揀靑升十萬元，斜橋揀靑爲一百五十五萬元，福建帮有進，生仁小十萬至十五萬元。</p>
<p>食油高挺</p>
<p>食油終見軋升二十萬，豆油回籠交易多，大有豆油早市以六百〇八萬開出，本街實銷甚佳，散戶相繼而進，步步做高，至最後爲六百二十萬元。大　新及大有餘，均以六百二十萬收市。生菜油初市廠方開五百九十二萬，回籠貨最後高至六百〇四萬元，靑島吉桶生油開盤七百十二萬，最後高至七百二十萬元。其他江北·重慶。生油均有做開，各漲約二十萬。吉桶小車蔴油六百九十萬元，豆餅平平之態。</p>
<h3>建築材料銷旺　磚瓦砂石飛騰</h3>
<p>建築材料中之磚瓦砂石，以生活指數增加，產地人工開支亦貴，更因春季銷路開展，而到貨不充，存底見薄，開價紫黄騰達。</p>
<p>靑足磚每萬漲至四千五百萬元，較之週初猛漲一千二百萬之鉅。靑磚做三千萬元，升七百萬。黄道磚二千二百萬元，靑瓦二千一百萬元，機紅磚六千萬元，機紅瓦每千做四千三百萬元，土紅瓦三千二百萬元。</p>
<p>黄砂每噸亦漲至一百萬元，石子一百二十萬元。各貨飛揚自一成至三四成不一。惟石灰及水泥尙覺平穩，但脚地亦已轉堅。</p>
<h3>輸出品原料自行進口　輸管會召集各業會商</h3>
<p>輸管會增加出口物資，爭取外匯頭寸，對於轍出品所需原料，決准各廠商自行進口，曾製訂輸出製造品原料進口辦法，經政院核准公佈施行。該會以各業所需之進口原料，極爲繁多，爲明瞭各業所需實際情形，特分別邀集各業會商，已於上月廿三日開始。邀集之單位，達卅二業之多，每日邀集一業或二三業代表人舉行會議。會中對於各業之出口量，與需要國外原料之數量，及製成品能換回外匯之數量，一一提出，該會再根據會商結果，予以核辦。</p>
<p>該會已約集會商者，截至四日止，右襯衫·汗衫·襪子·被單·毛巾，手帕·服裝·水瓶·搪瓷·鋼精·電器·膠木·紗管·毛織·織綢·木紗·橡膠·雨衣等十八業，今日（五日）起，紐扣·食品·玻璃·調味粉·傘·藤柳器·化粧·藥品·針釘·製罐·石粉·絲織風景·鏡子等十四業，繼續開會。</p>
<p>據該會負責人談：此項原料之輸入，在第四第五兩季限額之外，凡轍出製造品各廠商所需之原料，均可申請進口，由中央銀行供結外匯，其所請求輸入原料之總値，未超過其製成品輸出總額百分之四十者，可先行批准，如超過百分之四十者，得專案由請。此項辦法，亦爲連鎖制之試辦，但又別於一般之進出口連鎖者。當茲外匯拮据期中，政府　設法增加各廠商原料之輸入，實別具苦心，尚希輸出各業廠商，與政府通力合作。</p>
<h3>臺糖回振</h3>
<p>昨台糖第十期照常配售，配價如前，惟包額照八期額，計配出一二〇組特綿白一五一七五包，一八〇組二號砂白一〇五四〇包，比九期减少。而臺幣又長三元，爲一四五元，故市氣轉佳，復見回振。</p>
<p>公會劃盤，現貨二四粗白初爲三百六十萬元，旋升八十五萬元至八十萬元。四半白由三百八十五萬元至四百萬元。二〇中砂白三百十二萬元至三十萬元，升二三十萬元不一。</p>

<h3>華股交易旺盛　永紗賡續趨昂</h3>
<p>華股昨現遞轉期，及塲外轉移陣地，交易興奮，業中人買意仍殷。永紗賡續趨昂，惟雜股相形見絀，最後堅勢中漸形力竭。</p>
<p>晨開以銀根吿緊而稍形平疲，永紗以一一六〇元及一二一〇元之價登塲，開後一七九號等脫手即交，永紗即交先見一一五八元低價，但二二四號等即猛抬遞交，一九七號等吸即交，升至一一七七元及一二四三元。一四五號等出即交，一一七號等出遞交，塲外息價開高至二角八分半及三角三，存帳有未能咬貨者，迫低至一一四八元及一二二三元，現進貼價愈拔愈開，但業中大戶心意甚堅，大戶連續吸納，外股等亦有刺激，二三二號等均進三六號等進滬交，中興中絲掛漲停，永紗漲到一一一〇元及一二九〇元高價，一四一號等出遞交，九五號等出即交，近午低至一一八〇元及一二七〇元內。二二四號等力加扶助，二二六號等吸即交，午收爲一一九五元及一二八〇元。較前收即交股中與漲停，中絲漲停後有回，軋漲一成。中紡榮豐商務永公升半成，恒豐　安尙平，餘均微升。遞交股有貼價之故，各漲一成至一成半。</p>
<p>後市永紗自一二一〇元及一二九〇元起，六五號等出遞交，三五號等賣即交，退至一一九五元及一二七五元。二一八號等尙買而有盤，一三號等均賣遞交，一五七號等亦賣即交，跌至一一八〇元及一二四八元。一三號等現遞均進，一六〇號等進遞交，以中興漲停而漲到一二二五元及一二九三元新高價。一〇三號等出即交，一〇四　進後有出，國行差進甚少，雖回而有盤。一八三號等賣遞交，收市爲二八〇元及一二五七元。結果較量收計即交股中興仍停，恒豐升半成，中紡統益勤興平平，內衣微升，中法永公跌半成，餘均微挫。塲外各未上市股票，銀行文化公用大生再升半成至一成。</p>
<p>套利交易，昨因塲外改弦，十分熱鬧，貼價同吿步昂，　進　合息目二角三至二角七八分，如板上套利，可達三角以上。貼價計永紗開盤七〇元，自六七元升至八〇元，午收七八元。信和三〇元至三二元，美亞開價最高，爲一八〇元，低至一六〇元，收市一七〇元。小股在八元左右。</p>

<h3>外銷茶堅俏</h3>
<p>內銷茶自買戶連綿扒吸以來，昨日市上，終因本街與蘇錫等地之去化蟬聯，故問津者仍頗踴躍，過程遂猶不餒。至於洋莊茶市，吐納談判亦極絡繹，人心均吿穩健，而其趨勢，紅茶堅定，綠茶猛晋。推厥原因，前者進出互有，卒少變遷，後者存底空虛，執主居奇益甚，乃急遽上颺。</p>
<p>頃據同業談稱：聞最近本市出口商，突又接得北菲來電，囑購綠茶五百餘箱，其中以平水珠茶及屯溪珍眉居多數。惜目前該貨　將吿罄，情况有不敷分配之勢。瞻望前途，恐將愈露鋒鋩。</p>

<h3>上海市民的飲水問題</h3>
<p>— 蒼龍</p>
<p>誰都曉得水是人生所必需的東西，却不知道水是維持我人生命的最重要的東西。我人拿絕食者來說吧，印度有人能够絕食四十九日，却不能一天缺少飲水。我們又拿動物來試騐吧，假如我們把動物體內的永份總量取去其百份之廿，那未這筒勸物就因水份不足而死亡。由此推論，可見水對於人生的重要了。</p>
<p>感謝了天，把我們從內地帶到這箇有自夾水的上海地方來感謝了英國人，它在這以前被稱爲半殖民地的上海敷設了自來水機構，敎我們能够幸運地飲着這淸潔的水。這決不是過份的言論！我們假如到內地旅行一次，看見有水的地方一方面正在洗馬桶，而他方面却在汲水煮飯。至於西北地方缺水之處，那麼水的問題更是不堪設想的了。所以我們對於上海地方的自來水，正應該因爲能够享受着而驕傲。</p>
<p>可是，不幸得很，我們這個驕傲的享受來得太不長久了。自從太平洋戰事發生之後，我們上海的自來水逐漸地便變了質，起初是水的份量不够，到了後來却是不成其爲自來水了。我們在放水沐浴的時候往往會在浴缸裏檢很許多紅色的絲線蟲。至於顏色的渾濁以及沉澱物的增加那更是不容再說的了。那時我們當然覺得不舒服，很希望能够再飲着以前的淸潔的自來水。然而在敵人控制之下，也只有滿懷希望着天亮而已。</p>
<p>而今是天亮了，天亮已經有兩年多了。我們能不能再得着以前的享受呢？我不能說，我不敢說。我只能吿訴大家一句：「每次當着我飲着帶鹹性的開水或則飲着是茶而不像茶的鹹茶之後，就只有嘆息和搖頭。</p>
<p>當然有人會問我：「爲什麽自來水會　的呢」？「是不是帶有鹹味的黄浦江水滲到自來水裏來一？「是不是自來水的沙濾工作不够澈底」？「是不是……」這些問題都是全上海市民所想知道的問題。可是，我不能說，我不敢說。</p>
<p>上文我已經說過，水是維持人類生命最重要的東西，那末有關全上海數百萬人生命的自來水當然是非常重要的了。所以對於「全部水量的供給問題」，「水的成份問題」，「水的檢騐問題」，「水的澄情問題」，「水的過濾問題」以及「水的消毒問題」等等都應該由市政當局加以通盤籌劃和妥善的解決。</p>
<p>曾記得一八八四年的時候德國漢堡的自來水管裏因一時大意滲入了霍亂細菌，結果釀成了震警世界的漢堡大疫（死亡者有十餘萬人）。現在是冬去春來的時候，一切的都在萌發，所有的細菌都在待機而動，我現在希望本市的當局對於關係於數百萬全市市民生命安全的自來水問題，趕快加以檢討和改善；免得將來釀成了不可挽救的大禍，那末，我就多飲一些鹹水或鹹茶也無所謂了。</p>
<h3>漫談氣喘及其療法</h3>
<p>— 梁俊青</p>
<p>吾人臨診之際往往遇有病人前來請求診治氣喘病症。其實氣喘本身原為多種病症之症象，並非專指某種病症而言，例如患心臟病之人可以氣喘，患神經性氣枝管哮喘症者亦可氣喘，而患腎臟炎或糖尿病之人在某種情形中亦可發生氣喘，其他如神經錯亂症之發作以及肺氣腫，肺水腫等症則往往更有氣喘症象。是以吾人對於氣喘病症必須探本求源，事先詳細診察其病源所在，事後，方可決定其所患病症之有無痊愈希望而爲之對症下藥也。然而事實上以患病次數之多寡而言，則在一切之氣喘病症中當以神經性氣枝管哮喘症爲最易發生，最多發現，而且最爲痛苦，因此特草此文誌之，以爲此類病者之指南針。</p>
<p>顧名思義，本文之所謂神經性氣枝管哮喘症者（西文名Asthmabranchiale）當然爲一種與神經作用有關之氣枝管性哮喘症也。蓋其發作時之症象完全爲一種由於神經所操蹤之突然發作性氣枝管痙攣現象（其病症未發作時病者之一切與常人無異）。其胸腔作吸入性狀態，而其呼出空氣之動作則甚困難。當其呼氣外出時其支氣管粘膜以及最微細之小氣管粘膜皆作紅腫狀態而分泌出多量之粘液。此種粘液須借助於小氣管壁肌肉之收縮作用方得於甚爲艱苦之情形中將其排洩於外。根據臨診方面之調査結果，有百份之九十患者屬於過敏性病症，對於某種物質起過敏狀　時即行發生哮喘。又在心境惡劣或則情緒興奮之狀態中亦可有之，而第十條腦神經（即迷走神經）發生病態時尤易患之也。</p>
<p>病因</p>
<p>本病之患者雖不限於年　之大小及男女之性別，然而以臨床方面統計觀之，則以小孩之患者爲最多。至於小孩之患者中尤以二歲至四歲時爲最。蓋本病之原因多半屬於神經性之過敏作用所致，小孩出生之時日不久，對於體外物質容易發生過敏現象。且小孩之身體素質自父母方面接受者甚多，一旦遇有與其父母傳來之素質相反者，自易發生敵對作用之過敏現象也。至於體外物質，其足以刺激患者發生氣喘狀態之過敏現象者則種類甚多例如某種灰塵，某種空氣，某種氣候，某種蛋白質，某種食物的以及某種藥物之類，不下數十種一時不能盡述。昔比國學者Stormvan　Leerwen氏對此曾有偉大之研究。德種薩克遜血淸廠曾此種檢驗氣喘症之注射物。若能於此數十種過敏物中檢定其激刺氣喘發生之原因何在，則以後之療治問題必可迎刃而解，法至善也。惜此法雖有甚大效驗，而無效者間亦有之。終不能謂爲盡善盡美耳。最近有人曾將氣喘症患者之小便於氣喘發作時加以檢臉，結果發現有某種與蛋白質類似之內分泌素甚多，歷試不爽。於是有多數學者認爲氣喘與內分泌有關，並主張應用內分泌素加以治療，此法在原理方面當然比較新穎而合乎情理，但目前尙在實驗期內，未敢以之公開於世，動搖視聽也。</p>
<p>症象</p>
<p>本病之患者往往於以前之病歷中已有若干與衆不同之種種病症發生，例如兩耳朶常患濕疹，臉部及四肢各處常有濕疹發生。皮膚上任何一處原本健康如常，但若加以搔刮，則於若千小時後立即紅腫發炎，甚或發生流出液質之疱疹。此類患者以後面容易發生氣喘症者也。</p>
<p>本病發作時多在夜間，或則在日間發作而夜間則更爲加劇。初起時或則咳嗽或則立即氣喘，呼出空氣時非常困難，作喘息之吼聲，而吸入空氣時則胸膛擴大，而且拉長其肋骨根根顯露有如軟骨症患者。其頸部之肌肉及血管均作下陷式之痙療狀態。若以聽診器診察之，則胸膛內到處有吹笛音與水泡音。此種現象甚爲明顯，一次觀察之後，即可永記在心，不能去懷。至於此種發作性症象之經過時期則大槪維持一二日間即行退减變成輕度之咳嗽，而逐漸回復如常。此時之病者若已完全平復則與常人無異，固已不能辨認其病發時之狼狽狀態矣。</p>
<p>吾人在敎科書內往往讀得有「患氣喘者之白血球中常有嗜酸性白血球增加（Eosinophilie）及痰中有顧士髦氏纎維素（即Curschmannsche　Spirale）以及賴頓氏結晶體（即Leydensche　Kristalle）」之類，其實僅爲紙上談兵，在臨床方面往往毫無所得，所謂盡信書則不如無書者殆近似之耳。</p>
<p>治療方法</p>
<p>前已有言，本病之患者多半為神經性之過敏現象。是故此病之治療當然以其病原爲對象，例如食魚蝦之類發生氣喘者則以後必須戒忌魚腥之食物。又如聞得一種花香即行氣喘者則嗣後必須忌避此種花粉。此外如不耐於潮濕之天氣者，則須移居於氣候高爽之地。諸如此類，不能盡述，要須能隨機應付，觸類旁通耳。</p>
<p>前人之治療氣喘者恒喜用麻黄劑以及Adrenalin，Asthmolysin之類。此類藥物見效甚速，但藥力之退消亦快，蓋即所謂治標不治本之藥，茍其發作甚劇自可暫時應急一時，然而不能長期應用，長期用之不特見效甚少且可促成血管之硬化也。</p>
<p>在解痙劑中如Atropin，Exr．Belladonn　Erpado之類亦可濟急於一時，但其副作用甚大，非經醫師使用，則不可輕於嘗試。此外如硫磺製劑，蛋白質製劑，結核衛漿苗，Pepton以及內分泌素等皆有治療方面之效用，但屬於醫師方面之使用範圍，恕不備錄。</p>
<p>予對於氣喘患者每喜用　香氣與碘化鉀等劑，往往獲有奇效，蓋其旣可化痰止咳又可消除氣枝管之痙孿也。至於鈣質製劑以及維他命BC之類亦甚有助於此病之治療。總而言之此病旣已爲神經性之過敏現象，則其治療方法亦必從此方着手。上述之各種治療方法，要皆以避免過敏性發生爲主旨。至於治療方面之種種技術問題，則有賴於專門醫師之指示矣。</p>
<h3>肺病療治期中之良藥</h3>
<p>— 黃駿</p>
<p>肺結核的特效藥雖然至今還未發明，但是肺結核並不是一個難病。有錢的人，發現病狀得早，可以到空氣新鮮的地方休養，發現得遲，只要打空氣針剪肋骨，調養得好，痊愈的百分比絕對佔多數的。苦就苦在那一般沒錢的人，生了肺病還要負担家庭的開銷，面一仍要埋頭工作，一面並且愁慮經濟，因此痊好的希望就少了。</p>
<p>患了肺結核後，就一定立刻連帶地患上嚴重的歇斯的里亞症，憂鬱，多疑，暴燥……都接踵地跟了上來。紅樓夢里千姣百媚的林黛玉就是一個典型。那時患病的人爲要休養起見，需要靜臥，於是亂子就來了，他將每一件極簡單的事，分析得極複雜極煩瑣，並且往往又是對他不利的。譬如嫂嫂偶然向哥哥閃了一閃眼，那他在枕上就將這事演化得玄之又玄，奧之又奧，甚至聯想到他們倆或許聯合整個家族對那討厭的病人將要採取某種政策。有時非但如此，並且會憑空生出一個恐佈的念頭出來，刺激得自己發抖。這一則是他的病痛刺激了他的神經，二則是一逕横在床上精神無所寄托，幻覺自然會層出不窮了。但這種幻覺往往是痛苦的，而且有礙身體的，於是他的病也就逐步逐步的加深，患肺病者甚至因精神崩潰而至於死的亦不在少數。</p>
<p>然而，要病人自動的撇開這種幻覺而找尋快樂，那是辦不到的。如果要辦到，那非加上偉大的，帶有犧牲性的愛情不可。但是在家屬方面對這點的供給是不够的，爲了病人脾氣暴燥，因此時常生了冷心，甚至有時冷言冷語的抱怨病人。他們以爲有了這樣舒適的病房，如此精美的食品，昂貴的針藥，補品，病人是應該滿足了，自己亦似乎盡職了。然而這正是「功虧一簣」。一個誠懇些的人去探病，就可以聽到病人怨恨家屬對他的待遇，甚而至於雙淚涔涔。</p>
<p>愛情，也許它是包括了母愛，友愛和戀愛等等。像靑年的病人就需要戀愛來支持着他求生的勇氣。我有一個朋友患肺病，空氣打不進，家裏人都勸他開刀，但他是個胆小鬼，抵死不肯。後來家裏人急得沒有辦法，就邀請他的愛人來勸他。那女朋友很甜地對他說：「你開了刀，我跟你結婚」。我那朋友連想都沒有想就馬上答應了。至於小孩子患肺病呢，也許是好得快些。一則因爲母愛偉大，不分晝夜地整天的當心他，二則小孩子家沒有什麼思想，也不曉得什麽是愁苦，睡得着，吃得下，病自好得快了。最苦就是獨身的靑年人，我有一個朋友，跟哥哥住在一起，還沒有嫂嫂，他生肺病後又加上了肋膜炎，以後因爲醫生看得不得當，轉成TB性肋膜炎，如此纏綿病榻足足有五六年還沒好。中午他哥哥出去辦公，他一人寂寞得什麼似的，又不好勞動，只得一直看　本書。有時我去看他，總代他可惜不曾在病前找得一個女朋友。現在他精神的萎靡是沒有一個人不承認的。我估計他的康健還有六年病可生，但是他的精神最多支持二年了。</p>
<p>所以，假使你們中也有患肺結核的病人，不要忘記替病人找得偉大的帶有犧牲性的愛情。它正是像別的針藥補品一樣，是患肺結核者不可缺少的維他命呢。</p>
<h3>醫藥新聞</h3>
<p>— 蒼龍</p>
<p>（一）種牛痘可以治療潰爛性口瘡</p>
<p>在口腔裏有時可以發生潰爛口腔炎，不但疼痛異常而且極難醫治痊愈。有許多學者曾經試用砒製劑，或維他命C，維他命BI維他命B2以及菸鹼酸等劑爲之治療，但是結果毫無把握，有時見效，有時則又毫無效用。茲據瑞士勞伯特敎授報吿，謂此種口瘡爲一種濾過性菌毒所引起。若爲病者接種牛痘，則立即痊愈云。</p>
<p>（二）糖尿病可以促使肺結核惡化</p>
<p>據去年份英國醫刊報吿，糖尿病患者若不加以適當之治療，則極易促使其附帶之肺結核症日見惡化。因此Dr．W．R．Gaud　and　Dr．A．Lyall二氏在該文內極力主張，凡係患有糖尿病者每年必須用愛克司光檢査其肺部二次。若患者常有傷風鼻塞或則患有慢性之咽喉炎與及氣枝管炎之類，則更須隨時檢驗其痰液或胃液，以免肺結核在暗中發展云。</p>
<p>若生產後發生急性之乳房炎，則可注射大量之配尼西靈（每天二次每次肌肉內注射十萬單位）及內服小量之卵巢製劑（每天三次每次內服Img）則三四天內完全可以痊愈云。</p>
<p>（四）防止痧子發生之新法</p>
<p>據倫敦DrPTatchell報吿，在痧子（即麻疹）盛行時，除注射曾經患有痧子之血淸可以預防痧子之發生外，並可用溫熟之硼酸水每天洗滌鼻腔粘膜，亦可有同一之效果云。</p>
<p>（五）治療久治不愈之爛瘡新法</p>
<p>據美國支加哥Dr．J．A．Wolfer報吿，凡係久治不愈之爛瘡均有維他命C缺乏之原因。若能給以大量之維他命C劑，則其痊愈甚速云。</p>

<h3>醫藥下鄕論（下）</h3>
<p>— 徐勁</p>
<p>醫師們為什麼都集中在都市裹？回答是在他們沒有更好的地方去以前只有留駐在都市裏，因爲現代醫　是實用科學的一部門，新醫與新藥實有相依爲命的關係，我國科學落後，醫藥猶未獨立，外來的藥物大都集散在都市裏，而且醫療器械與醫院設）備有賴於水電之力不少，窮鄉僻壤不用說沒有水電的設備，連一所像樣的房子都沒有，筆者從賈汪徐州一帶回來，一路所見都是土砌的房子，就像一偶土窰，只有一個洞口，算是門洞，也算是窗口，不用笑，那便是大多數同胞的寢食蔽風之所，賈汪鎭因有個華東煤礦公司，還有幾幢現代建築，有學校醫院，也有水電的供備，已儼然一個小型都市的風格，然而沒有充分的藥物，也常使醫師爲難，風氣閉塞，與交通阻絕，最爲現代文明之敵，也最爲新醫新藥之敵，有些地方至今還未開通，寗信巫師而不請醫師，迷信神怪而不信賴科學，這都有賴敎育爲之先導，然後書　方能普及，有些鄕鎭，因爲沒有正式醫師。全是江湖郎中的天下，他們掛着西醫的牌子，在做黑幕生意；略知注射的手　，便掛出一針包愈的廣吿，不僅誤人性命，也呌人誤會西醫便是那一套，但偶有正式醫師下鄕，以不習於他們那套江湖手腕，旣不吹牛，也不敷衍，却往往弄得鑃羽而歸，原來鄉下醫師出診往往要步行幾十里路，（有船坐船，無船便須步行）並且不得另開出診費，收費連藥費在內，只開一個總數，（某醫師對我說，鄉間出診與都市不同，鄉人來請，不可不去，不去就有人背議，會影響業務，出診後只許開一個總數，若要細開賬目，鄕人一定不滿，）可以需索多少就多少，這種行徑醫師如不會或不屑做就無法立足，所以在鄉間成功者未必是好醫師，却是諗知鄕人心理的老江湖，此間所謂鄕下還只限於鐵路幹綫所經過的鄕鎭，尙且是江湖醫生的地盤，其他僻鄕，怕連一知半解的江湖郞中都沒有。</p>
<p>都市裏的醫師未嘗無意下鄕，說實話，即以上海而論，在上海能有固定收入的醫師，爲數並不多，其餘的只爲沒有更好的去處，只才棲留上海，一來固因四方戰亂，幾無乾凈之地，（筆者有友在北平某醫院服務，頃也寫信欲南來上海，）二來即有意「開碼頭」，（下鄕）其困難有如上述，故而躊躇未去者良多，其中包括着敎育問題，建設問題與交通問題，都非醫師獨力所能解決，想起這種人才的浪費，實堪痛惜。</p>
<p>復興島上有許多剩餘物資聽任霉爛毁損，其中包括大量汽車，食糧與藥物，巳有人大聲疾呼過，然而這種專門人才的浪費，還不見有人嘆息，蔣委員長在「中國之命運」裏說過，以中國幅員之大，需有二十幾萬位醫師，方够分配，但是造成一位醫師需要多少年心血，現在醫師人數距最低目標猶不逮十分之一，却還聽任其在都市間　爛！</p>
<p>現在市立醫院服務之醫師，其待遇之低，逼使許多優秀人才都脫離自立，以致私人診所密佈，競爭益烈，而醫院成績不　爾爾，最近市衛生局張局長雖有意辭職，最大的原因據說是經費不足，公務人員待遇過低，無法誘致專門人才，以致許多計劃無從開展，這是多麽矛盾的現象！我們這社會如果需要專門人才來建設，就該特殊禮遇之，不僅可使他們安心工作，更可因此激勵人心，獎育人才，以前有人想買千里馬，人以死馬紿之，買者審知是千里馬之骨，也付以重酬，由是則良馬踵門而至者不計其數，現在則反是，又欲馬兒跑，又不給馬吃飽，人才那得不散去！</p>
<p>筆者嘗遇着好幾位同道，都厭極了都市，認爲醫師在都市，無非侍候那批鉅富大賈，（由於醫藥費的昂貴，貧民早被擯絕在醫藥門外，）如果有誰能保證他們的生活，他們自願下鄉服務去，可是現在的問題就是沒有這種保證人，爲了生活，他們也只還滯留在這厭極的都市裏！</p>

<p>自由談</p>
<h3>談「失敗主義」</h3>
<p>— 吳庸</p>
<p>要把一件事情辦好，必須自己深信能够把該事辦得好，這是「成功」的必要條件，我認爲此理至簡。</p>
<p>本年二月號「讀者文摘」雜誌中有一篇「書摘」，題目呌做「心靈活動的範圍」，作者名呌蘭因。據道位作者以科學方法實驗的結果，證明心靈的力量可以傳達，可以應響物質。舉例來說：我們擲骰千的時候，若是擲着玩兒，心不在焉，不把牠當作一回事，則於數千百擲中數粒骰子拼起來的數　是依照數學中的「或然律」的；如果我們是集中了精神，擲時一心一意地要骰子凑出某一數　來，據這位作者說，其結果可以變更數學上的「或然律」，這就是說，於數千百擲中，心中所欲骰子凑成的數字之出現可以顯得比「或然律」所許可的次數爲多；而且其次數的多寡與擲者心神集中的程度之高下成正比例。這位作者這樣便證明了心神的力量足以左右物質。</p>
<p>上述的那種說法是　正確，我們沒法斷定。只是無論做什麼事，我們必得集中了精神，一心一意地幹去，並深信其必成，然後才會有成功的希望，這點我想是一定的道理。中國人素來講究一個「誠」字，其義雖不簡單，可是以其對事一點言，也並非是「誠心」「誠意」做事的意思。廟宇里神　前大多有一塊匾，題曰：「誠則靈」，這雖是迷信，但若栘於作爲治事的座右銘，把牠改爲二「誠則成」，載認為是不錯。</p>
<p>反之，我們若是心里狐疑，覺得某事已瀕絕境，恐怕是沒有救藥了吧，這樣，則其心已虛，其　已移，辦起事來也就談不到效率，欲求其事之成，自然難了。以這樣的態度治事，便是　　所謂「暮氣沉沉」。個人若是「暮氣沉沉」，便不能走上「光明之路」；熄滅了「自信」的燈，何能見到「光明」？這是說個人的小事；如果是一件大事，則個人的「暮氣」還會傳播開去，影響到他人，影響到整個的社會國家。</p>
<p>這種暮氣，換一句古話來說，即是「意不誠」「志不堅」；在外國便是呌做「失敗主義」。近年來我們整個的社會似乎是沈湎在「暮氣」中，此爲無可諱言者。就經濟一項來說，一年來我們就聽到許多「失敗主義」的論調。有些人說：「對付這種局面祗有神仙才會有辦法。」有些人說：「物價不免徐你上漲。」更有些人說：「米的配價一月之內決不再行更動。」竟還有發如下的論調的：「將來幣制改革後，新貨幣膨脹至目前之程度，約須在十年左右。」這一類話，私人之間說說，尙且不必；若是出諸政府官吏之口，則尤屬不該。公開表示「失敗主義」固然無補於事而有礙於大局；於無意之間顯露「中國人的事總歸弄不好」的錯誤思想，對於社會一般視聽亦有很重大的不良影響。米價何以下一個月必會上揚呢？新幣何以經過十年又會膨脹呢？下一個月的事固置勿論，足下又何以能預測十年之後的經濟情形必壞呢？這無非表示說者已經失去了對中國民族的信心。這一類話好像是烏　的呌聲，象徵不祥之兆，聽了實在可厭。筆考認為極有予以糾正的必要。</p>
<p>我國的事，表面上好像很是複雜，令人無從下手，；實則米必盡然。我國的所謂「浩刦」，「人禍」的成份多於「天災」。而所謂「浩刦」也者，決不是如一般人所設想的那樣「無可挽回」。須知「人定勝天」一語，實有至理。只是我們必須抱定「必勝」的信心幹去，這是挽救所謂一浩刦」的第一步。如果我們「心不在焉」，「和尙撞鐘」主義，無意於把事情弄好，甚至存心將事情攪壞，則事情之不會好轉，初不待言。</p>
<p>其次，我們務須　事負責，不要推諉責任，明明是「人禍」，而名之曰「天災」，此即是推諉責任。情形惡化了，而說是此係整個局勢　致，非一人一區所能負責，此亦即是推諉責任。哲學上有「客觀」「主觀」二說；社會　上亦有「讓境」「個人」之飾。主「客觀說」者請「客觀」足以左右「主觀」；主「環境」說者，謂「環境」足以控制「個人」。實則「客觀」到底，則「主觀」即是「客觀」；主「環境說」至於極端，則「個人』亦即是「環境」的一部份。換言之，局部的事乃是整個局面之一部，「整個」是多個「局部」所構成的。「個人」乃是社會國家的一份子，社會國家是許多「個人」所構成的。「局部」不好，何能求「整個」之好？「個人」不良，何能希望「個人」所構成的社會國家有良好的成績？我們要造金字塔，必須先有整齊方正的一塊塊的石料。於社會的事亦並無異致。我們又怎麼可以妄言「環境不良」呢？孔子說：身修則家齊，家齊則國治，國治則天下平，亦是此意。欲先求天下太平，而後再事修身，則天下終不得太平。時人常說「中國人的事終歸攪不好」云云，我們得先問一問：我也是中國人，我自己好不好？且慢說人家不好，不要把一切的不好歸咎於抽象的「環境」或「社會」或「國家」。</p>
<p>我們必須人人樂觀地自信一切定可迎刃而解。其解決之道便是：先自個人做起。</p>
<h3>戰爭雜談</h3>
<p>— 茂仁</p>
<p>美國雜誌「皇冠」二月號　幾十張七拼八凑的照片，描寫「和平的愁眉苦臉」，形容　至。首述幾百萬慘遭戰禍的人民，奴隸工人，以及逃出虐政的難民，經過一無人煙的農田，破壞毁損的鐵路工廠，跋涉還鄕，而他們的故國老家，却是饑饉刧餘的法國俄國與巴爾幹。同時七百七十萬西歐猶太人，戰後已只剩一百五十萬，顚沛流離，想化聖地巴力斯坦以活命。次述戰敗國的德國，人民失業，瀕爲　殍。而戰勝國家呢。英國酒店鬥可羅雀，衣着全靠配給，每人每星期一隻鷄蛋，四兩甜食。法國人面黄肌瘦。更苦的是意國人，飽嘗獨裁統治者種下的禍殃。希臘人則爲穩定家國，非大打特打不可。在我們亞洲，昔日團結以求獨立自由的印度，今已分裂爲印徒敎印度與回敎徒巴基斯坦。中國則幾百萬饑民不知和平爲何物，內亂不已，烽火遍地。日本却在聯軍監視之下，苦吃苦做。就連得天獨厚，又獲地利人才的美國吧，人民也苦於物價日漲，屋荒奇重，雖知「新戰爭」之說十九爲宣傳之談，但明曉得永久的和平還遠在天邊，猶如鏡花水月。而　蘇之間，一個是不容商量，一個是意志堅決，相持不下，僵局日深。原子炸彈的威脅臨頭，大家不知如何是好——好一個悲慘世界　！</p>
<p>是誰弄得這樣天昏地黑，雲愁霧慘的呢？當然是侵略國家的獨裁者與軍閥，他們是瘋人，也是傻子。想做英雄豪傑，稱霸稱正，不惜興師動衆，死人亡國。所以今日的處決戰犯，兄弟拍手贊成。然而處決的辦法殊欠高明，鄙意應由十該國人民自己司其事，以示民意所在，衆怒難犯。由戰勝國來判決，無論經過多少庭審問辯論，多少個年月以示法律公平，典型明正，也不免有成王敗寇之嫌。要使侵略而戰勝的戰犯亦受其國人或世人的處罰，事實上無法辦到似使侵略而戰敗的戰犯受其國人裁判，總是易如反掌，而且名正言順。更重要的一點，是普通愛國旣爲美名，死於外國人之手考爲烈士，則丁國戰犯之爲甲乙丙國所處決，死者一定以「爲國犧牲」自豪而自慰，其國人亦必有此類感覺。戈林之臨刑以前自殺，博得德國人的嘖嘖歎賞，不正是此種心理，昭然若揭嗎？歷史上的政治軍事「大英雄」原很少不受後代明眼人唾罵，奇的是　駡盡管唾馬，英雄還是有人要做，甚至不惜以身殉之。什麼道理？其中之一是：就迎唾駡他的人也一面駡不絕口，一面讚之不已。我記得歐戰初起之際，美國一名記者大駡希特勒該死，說是與弗雷特力克「大帝」一樣侵略野心甚熾，一樣可殺。當時我覺得此文如給希特勒看了，一定說，「我就是想做弗雷特力克呀，先王倘非恣意使略，怎得大帝尊稱，你這個駡他駡得要命的人，不正在『大帝』『大帝』的尊之不已嗎？」現在審訊東條之類，雖未冠以「日本忠君愛國的英雄」尊號，但横一庭直一庭的審之不已，至少使他有隙可乘，大發其爲國爲民的壯語，有暇寫由他胡說的回憶錄，竊以爲不免是一失着。補救之道，趕緊把他殺之餵狗。如說這不免野蠻，那應野蠻之舉多矣，何必對於應野蠻之處不野蠻一下。</p>
<p>大戰爭以後世界自然難免於饑饉疫癘，正如經過大手術之後的病人，不會體健如常一樣，故如一戰眞能止戰，世人略感苦痛之後也就慢慢會得復原，眼前凍餒，眞是何足掛齒。然而現狀所示，大有再來一戰之虞，反弄成以戰引戰了。這是什麽道理？有一洋人寫過一本書，呌「歐洲何以再戰」（指第二次大戰），裏邊有一句甚有意思：「歷史上一切事情原來並無眞正的開頭，一如絕沒有結束一樣。但戰爭總有開塲之處，而此次戰爭的確鑿開塲，就在原以之結束上次大戰的和約簽訂之日，即一九一九年六月二十八日。」假如第三次世界大戰而不幸爆發，後世史家必將說此戰在德蘇開戰英美大聲聲明全力援蘇之　，即已開端了罷！</p>
<p>戰爭是罪惡的事，而每一次的國際上戰爭都有一套好聽動人的戰爭道理，我想今之政治領袖外交專家，一面固在聯合國爲世界和平而努力，一面也已經在推敲下次大戰的戰爭原因，準備鼓勵國人同仇敵愾的文吿了！</p>
<h3>獅子林沿革</h3>
<p>— 王百里</p>
<p>刊物，謂蘇州獅子林，係元末畫家倪雲林所築，余遊獅子林時，嚮導者亦言之鑿鑿，其實皆誤也。按梁章鉅浪跡續談卷一載云：客有招余重游獅子林者，余笑謝之，蓋余於吳郡園林，獨嫌獅子林之逼仄，殊悶人意，故前　蘇藩時，亦曾偕友往游一次，而並無片語紀之，或謂此園爲倪雲林所築，則亦誤也。曾聞之石竹當前軍云：元至正間，僧天如惟則，延朱德潤·趙善長·倪雲林·徐幼文共商疊成，而雲林爲之圖，取佛書獅子座而名之耳。明時尙屬畫　寺，國初（淸初）鞠爲民居，荒廢已久，乾隆二十七年南巡蒞吳，始開闢蔓草，築衛墻垣，中有獅子峯·含暉峯·吐月峯·立雪堂·臥雲室·問梅閣·指柏軒·玉鑑池·冰壺井·修竹谷·小飛虹·大石屋諸勝，又有合抱大松五株，故又名五松園，則人所鮮知也。據此，則此園雖非倪氏所築，然倪氏亦曾參與疊成，且又為之圖，後人以其名重故沿誤耳。</p>
<h3>逍遙花</h3>
<p>— 陳慎言</p>
<p>第十一章　滿腹疑雲　（八八）</p>
<p>忠傑道：「這話還用我多說嗎，你的家裏養一個極漂亮小滑頭，誰不知道！我來時他就躱開，我一走他就出現，這人也許現在還藏在你屋裏呢！」綺紈抖着嘴唇，顫聲說道：「請你認明自，我不是這樣人！」忠傑鼻子裏哼了一聲道：「什麼！你還不承認呀？這小子給我捉住，就立刻槍斃，不但把他槍斃了，就是你也得不了便宜，我爲了你的事，鬧得幾乎丢官罷職，我不願當這寃大頭，你快把那小子呌出來！」綺紈道：「繆處長，請你不要聽別人的閑話，我不至這樣苟賤，我要結交朋友，儘可光明正大結交，何至鬼鬼祟祟呢！這是旁人造作謠言，有意中傷我們。」忠傑道：「規在我也沒工夫，和你辯論，要表明你的心跡，你就跟我走！我沒話可說。不然，我可不饒你！你說吧。」忠傑說完，站了起來，一手向褲袋摸着，看那神氣，似要拿出手槍。綺紈生性，本極倔强，此時經忠傑再三凌辱，已是忍無可忍，心裏一横，暗忖早晚總是一死，我何必再敷衍他！當下眉頭一蹙，大聲說道：「你太侮辱我了，我不能受你的侮辱！你想强迫我跟你走，這個辦不到，你不要妄想，你愛怎麼辦，我都不怕！」忠傑喝道：「好吧！」倐的由褲袋內，拿出手槍，指着綺紈胸脯道：「我就打死你！」綺紈挺着胸脯，往前一凑說道：「打死就打死，我不怕！」正在此千鈞一髮之際，小王媽和綺紈的哥哥肖鶴搶了進米，横身擋在二人之前，把忠傑槍口擋住。原來肖鶴今天看見報紙所登新聞，又聽外間許多閒話，覺得妹子鬧出這樣　事來，在梨園界同　面子上，很不好看，拿了報紙，來到綺紈家裏，原想勸吿綺紈一番，呌她歛跡一點，保全名譽。不想走進門時，正値忠傑和綺紈在房內吵鬧，不便進云，只和小王媽在旁門外靜聽，起初見忠傑駡綺紈養小白臉，心中便忿忿不平，後來見忠傑拿出手槍來威脅，便和小王媽搶了進入，横身在二人之間，說道：「請不要動武，有話好商量。」忠傑喝道：「你是什麽人？」肖鶴道：「我是綺紈的哥哥。</p>

<h3>動物的智慧</h3>
<p>— 毛毅</p>
<p>生命的智慧在動物界隨處可見。我們淡論着動物的非凡的行爲，稱之爲本能。</p>
<p>對於研究動物行爲的學者，這個問題和我們一樣的無法理喩，我們所能說的祗是承認動物，即使是最低級的動物，具有令人難以置信的智慧—但是，知其然而不知其所以然。</p>
<p>例如，以蜜蜂來說。他們建立了一種人類所夢想不到的文化。他們勞動，建築，和儲蓄；他們服從法律和懲罰那些破壞法律的同族；他們的生活和行動處處表現最高級的愛國精神。</p>
<p>讓我們想想蜘蛛和他的網。牠似乎學習過一切的工程藝術。牠替自己建築了一條活路，又爲投網者佈下死路。預備在暴風雨中逃生用的船上的滑走索，就是參考蛛網而改進</p>
<p>在阿基米德時代以前許久，小水獺就建立了工程的基本原則之一。永獺遠在人類建築第一座橋樑之前就創立了牠的堤壩時代。牠也替牠自己建築過冬用的住宅和倉庫。、提起貓和狗，我們忍心把牠們當做玩物看待嗎？貓是動物之中最敏感的。假如你把牠裝在蔴袋中，或者盒子中，放還到數　里之外，牠依然能够找出故居。狗是最忠心的了，不知有多少義犬用急智拯救過牠們的身為萬物之地靈的主人！</p>
<p>一個迷了途的人，可能按着星座，找到歸家之路，我們稱讚這種人聰明。可是，有許多馬却能够在黑夜之中將牠們的迷途的主人馱回家去。有的馬甚至能够在大城市的擁塞的街道中把喝醉了酒或者失去了知覺的車夫載到目的地。</p>
<p>這種異常的方向感，鴿子表現得最爲强烈。有一隻鴿子，曾經從羅馬飛回到牠的在英國的棚舍。牠一共飛越上千哩路，超波一連串的山脈和二十哩的海面，而所費的時間不過是一個月。</p>
<p>人類自尊為萬物之靈，但是，就本能方面比較起來說，人類却非處處皆「靈」了。</p>
<h3>聯的變化法</h3>
<p>— 清雷學圖</p>
<p>舊曆元宵接到申報，見香港新聞，有位在那裏作寓公的李濟琛將軍，自書春聯，是「中國陸軍皆後輩」，「粤中名將盡門生」。好大的口氣！彷彿前淸浙江名流們爲瑞安孫老翰林（鏘鳴）上壽的一副「天下翰林皆後輩」，「一朝將相兩門生」。此事若依舊式論文者談起來，縱然不說「套襲成文」，亦難免議其「蓋有所本」。實則襲舊亦並非絕對不可，有的是「靑出於藍而勝於藍」，有的是、學步追踪，望塵莫及」，有的是「點鐵成金」，有的是「唐突西子」。至於襲得好不好，則以事實內容，及才學技術而分。上述李氏一聯，究竟那些武士都是他的「後輩」「門生」與否？因無從調査，難以置詞。其寫作之精　，自亦無需甚解。如今且說說孫老先生那一副，則優絀自易分明．</p>
<p>孫老先生是浙江溫州府瑞安縣人，名鏘鳴，字韶甫，淸道光辛丑科翰林，纔二十幾歲。丁未科爲會試同考官，收了兩個歷史有名人物，一個李鴻章，一個沈葆楨，都是他手裏薦中的，成進士入翰林，成同年間與洪楊軍交戰，屢獲勝利。李在江蘇巡撫任封一等威毅伯，官至大學士直隸總督，大學士即古之宰相。沈任江西巡撫擒獲洪秀全之子福　，亦封有世職，後仕至兩江總督，總督又稱「制軍」，有大將的威權。沈李不但官高位尊，且是當時的人豪，故「一朝將相兩門生」，確實値得一誇。沈李都是道光時代的翰林，在光緒初已是四朝元老，尙几是孫先生的門生，（孫慶七十時，沈已故去多年）辛丑科以前各科的前輩及辛丑同年都已紛紛下世，所存在的翰林出身的大老，科分都在孫先生之後，故「天下翰林皆後輩」亦千眞萬確。這兩句可稱氣象萬十。後人如想套用，自應特加斟酌。大凡學前人製作法，最好是善爲變化，各肖身分，各有神理，使他人看不出套用固妙，使他人看出套用，仍須贊賞其變化得法則更妙。例如曾文正榮哀錄上有一副輓聯：「平生風義兼師友」，「萬古雲霄一羽毛」。作者歐陽氏與曾公的交誼確在師友之間，曾的身分與諸葛丞相的勳望又甚相稱，故爲佳作。於是　幾道輓吳摯甫亦就先來了一句「平生風義兼師友」。下句則換上三國曹操對判備的話「天下英雄惟使君」把「與操耳」三字截去，文義仍然可通，句法字數恰與上句相對，旣推崇老吳，亦表出自負，又不著痕迹，實是靈心妙腕，全無滯相。再則舊京老伶工不瑤卿輓　老的伶工陳德霖的一副，因老王年齡行輩比老陳晚得多，但非徒弟，所以上聯亦來一句一平生風義兼師友」，下句則用長恨歌之「一別音容兩渺茫」。陳王二旦角都是梨園出色人才，「音容」二字正關合在有意無意之間，可稱巧思綺合，儼如無逢天衣（此聯係瑤卿好友閩詩人釋堪氏代筆）。至如楊老五（士琦）輓于晦老（式枚）上句亦來一句「平生風義兼師友」，算是按合雙方交誼，下句又來一句「萬古雲霄一羽毛」，算是抬出晦翁的身分，完全把歐陽輓老曾那一副照抄一遍，下筆如此容易，可發一笑矣。民國九年初（戊午之暮冬），袁寒雲有佳紙擬揮一聯相贈，我請先寫「豈有文章驚海內」，寒雲曰：下句必是「漫勞車馬駐江干」，予曰那太熟了，須換一換。步林屋曰，然則「從無械札到公卿」。予嫌名士氣太重，與「漫勞車馬」句都太露骨。後仍由寒雲改擬「枉拋心力作詞人」，即隨筆寫下。後覺此對雖妥，却還是「寒雲廬」的身分，因爲他是十足的「詞人」，而凌　漢閣則並未　此拋過心力。</p>
<p>憂樂雜誌曾載張惟屛母以貞女守節，生於冬月十五，卒於中秋，有輓聯云：「從夫云何，從子云何，大節死生風義重」，「仲冬之望，仲秋之認，淸光來去月明中」。下聯個與張司馬輓沈文肅夫人下聯「以中秋生，以中秋逝，天邊圓皓魄，霓裳仙子證前身」同一意致，而各擅丰神。</p>

<p>（一）依現行法，配偶與直系血親卑親屬同爲繼承時，其應繼分，與他繼承人平均。（參民法第一一四四條第一款及第一一三八條）分配。（二）依現行法，不論已嫁未嫁，女子有繼承權，但甲犬亡故時日，是否在女子獲得繼承權之後，乃一問題。（三）甲子亦爲共同繼承之一，登報聲明非經其同意，不得出售，自有其效力。（四）未經分析，不能確定各人應繼者何種財產，本件應光分析，然後可以各自處分。（五）本件可訴請析產。（六）依法訴請扶養。（參民法一一一四條至一一二一條各項規定）（七）如合遺棄條件，可以刑事起訴。刑法第二百九十條規定，對於直系血親等親屬犯遺棄罪，加重本刑二分之一。</p>

<h3>MacArthur States Opinion on Aiding China: Military Problems Should Be Resolved First; China's Freedom is Related to World Peace</h3>
<p>[United States News Service, Washington, 3rd] General MacArthur declined the invitation from Congress to return to the US to testify on the China Aid Bill, but sent a telegram to the House of Representatives outlining his views, expressing support for aid to China.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 3rd] General MacArthur telegraphed House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Eaton today, stating, "A free, independent, peaceful, and friendly China is of utmost importance to world peace. The fundamental problem in China today is the military one, which must be resolved before internal recovery can be expected to progress." It is reported that this is MacArthur's first statement on the China issue since commanding the Allied Headquarters. This telegram, sent by MacArthur from Tokyo, is a formal response to the Foreign Affairs Committee's request for him to express his views on the China Aid plan. He emphasized that the international aspect of the China issue has been obscured by demands for internal reforms, while internal reforms are only secondary to the issue of China's civil war. MacArthur declared: "To underestimate China's needs or importance would be a great mistake. If we are to pursue a universal policy of defending the frontiers of freedom and deterring the attacks of political despots, then the importance of each frontier is equal" (The full text of MacArthur's telegram to Eaton is on the left-hand side).</p>
<h3>House to Draft Separate China Aid Plan: European Recovery Plan as Blueprint for China Aid; Marshall Says Has Discussed with Our Authorities</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 3rd] It is learned that a House China Aid Bill is currently being drafted and may be formally introduced next week. The bill will be formulated based on the economic aid plan listed by US judge and China expert, Alerman, to the House Foreign Affairs Committee yesterday, which advocates economic assistance of more than 900 million US dollars, plus an unspecified amount of military aid.</p>
<p>[Another Dispatch] Republican Congressman Vorys stated: Military aid will be included in the proposed China Aid Bill.</p>
<p>[Another Dispatch] Marshall, in answering questions before the House Foreign Affairs Committee today, stated that the US has discussed with the Chinese government the issue of using the European Recovery Plan as a blueprint for the China Aid plan. He also said: "We have discussed the above issue with Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Shijie, Chinese Ambassador to the US Gu Weijun, and the Chinese technical delegation currently in the US. At the same time, Democratic congressmen on the House Foreign Affairs Committee who support the government's stance on military aid to China and oppose combining foreign economic and military aid bills into 'one package' have submitted a list of speakers to express their views on the China Aid plan, including former Ambassador to China Gauss, recently retired head of the US Military Advisory Group to China Lucas, former UNRRA Director Lucas, former UNRRA China Office Director Egerton, former US Naval Attaché to the US Embassy in China McHugh, and Federal Reserve Board economic expert Tamagna, among others, but the date for seeking the opinions of the above individuals has not been specified.</p>
<h3>Wedemeyer's Testimony on Aiding China: If Military Aid is Not Given to Prevent Communist Expansion, US Will Have to Pay with Blood</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper Report] New York, 4th, broadcast, Washington dispatch, former US military commander in China, General Wedemeyer, testified before the House Foreign Affairs Committee on the 4th, claiming that if steps are not taken quickly to curb the expansion of communism, the United States will have to "pay with blood." If the United States wants to prevent the "widespread actions" of communism, it must provide military aid to other countries in addition to economic aid. Wedemeyer stated: He has always admired General Marshall, but his views on military aid are indeed very different. He does not believe that economic aid alone can stop communism in any part of the world. He believes that under the current circumstances, the United States does not need to directly participate militarily in China's anti-communist struggle, but should provide military aid to the Chinese National Government. He said: Two years ago, giving China 200 million US dollars in economic aid alone would have been effective, but given that the strength of the Communist Party has increased since then, he believes that even if 570 million US dollars in economic aid is given now, it is not enough, and it must be supplemented by military aid to be effective.</p>
<p>[This Newspaper Report] General Chennault has been invited by the US House Foreign Affairs Committee and will fly to the US in the next few days, arriving in Washington before March 10 to testify on the China Aid Bill. According to Chennault, he is rushing to draft a written opinion, and his views on the China Aid Bill will focus on military and economic aid, with military aid being the prerequisite.</p>
<h3>MacArthur Intends to Compete for President</h3>
<p>Already Expressed in China Aid Stance</p>
<p>[United Press, Tokyo, 4th] According to people close to MacArthur, MacArthur's views on aiding China clearly indicate that he will accept the nomination as a presidential candidate. His campaign platform is a world plan to stop Soviet expansion.</p>
<p>MacArthur today was unwilling to exaggerate his response to House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Eaton. Chinese sources here praised MacArthur's statement as "the first world statesman to give the clearest analysis of the main problems faced by the Chinese people to date."</p>
<h3>US Official McCaby Wastes Surplus Materials</h3>
<p>Republican Congressman Reveals Inside Story</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 3rd] When the Senate Banking Committee examined the qualifications of former Overseas Surplus Assets Administrator McCaby to serve as a member of the Federal Reserve Board today, Republican Senator Du倍 issued a statement of ten thousand words, accusing McCaby of improper measures in the sale of surplus assets to China. It is claimed that McCaby's agent in China, Johnson, had agreed to sell eleven B-25 bombers, which were almost brand new, to a certain company opened by Soong Tzu-liang. When the news of this transaction was published in the newspapers, McCaby overstepped his authority and ordered the tails of the sold aircraft to be cut off. McCaby admitted that his role was to avoid unfavorable publicity at home. Another new B-25 aircraft, worth 243,000 yuan, was not included in the surplus assets and was similarly handled by McCaby's subordinates.</p>
<h3>Executive Yuan Designates Qingdao as Port of Direct Access for Foreign Ships</h3>
<p>British Ship Has Already Sailed to America for the First Time with Cargo</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Qingdao, 4th] Qingdao has recently been designated by the Executive Yuan as a port of direct access for foreign ships. On the 28th of last month, a British ship came to Qingdao for the first time, fully loaded with local products such as peanut oil, vermicelli, and bristles, and sailed directly to the Americas.

<h3>People of Northeast Support Government: Seeking Close Cooperation Between Politics and Military; Petition Representatives Express Two Points of View to the Ambassador</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 4th] Ambassador Stuart invited Wang Huayi, Zhang Baochi, Li Zhonghua, and Tian Yushi of the Northeast Petition Delegation to lunch at his residence at 12:00 noon on the 4th and inquired in detail about the recent military situation in the Northeast, with particular emphasis on the relationship between the people and the government and the relationship between the people and the army, and hoped that the people could organize their own forces to defend themselves. The Ambassador repeatedly expressed his deep concern about these two points. At that time, Wang and others expressed two points. A. The delegation's visit to Beijing this time indicates that the people of the Northeast are making every effort to support the Central Government and are willing to cooperate with the Central Government. The reason for putting forward these suggestions is to seek cooperation with the government. B. Regarding the establishment of local armed forces, this is the unanimous opinion of the representatives of the Northeast. It is reported that the representatives who came to Beijing this time include elderly, middle-aged, and young people, and their opinions are unified. All of this is sufficient to show that the entire people of the Northeast are trying to find ways to closely coordinate politics and the military. The Ambassador was extremely pleased after hearing Wang and others' replies.</p>
<h3>Representatives Visit Ministries of Food, Finance, and Communications: Hope to Resume Transportation of Grain</h3>
<p>After leaving the Ambassador's office, the delegation rested briefly and then went to the Ministry of Food, Ministry of Communications, and Ministry of Finance to provide opinions.

At noon on the 5th, Wang Yunwu and members of the Youth Party hosted a banquet, and at 2:00 p.m., the Northeast Fellow Villagers Association held a welcome party, inviting Northeast elders and petitioning delegation to attend.</p>
<h3>Zhang Jia'ao Returns to Shanghai</h3>

<p>Had Discussed Measures with the Authorities</p>
<p>[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 4th] Zhang Jia'ao, president of the National Bank of China, came to Beijing on the morning of the 3rd and returned to Shanghai by train on the morning of the 4th.

<h3>Situation in Northeast is Becoming Brighter: No Trace of Bandits Within 100 Li of Shenyang; National Army in Siping Has Also Completed New Deployment</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper, Shenyang, 4th] Except for small groups of bandit troops in the South Shahe and Liaoyang areas of Shenyang Border Force, there are no traces of bandits within 100 li in the west, east, and north. People's hearts are stable, and prices are also tired. The farmers in Chengxian Township eagerly hope to rectify discipline so that they can prepare for spring plowing. Only Zhou Jing in Shenxi Xinmin Da'an has small groups of bandits scurrying around. The number of bandits in southern and western Liaoning has also been greatly reduced, and most of the bandits have been transferred across the Liao River. In addition to the fact that the bandits' major attack on Siping has become more concrete, there are two other possibilities for the large-scale northward transfer of bandits: one is to attack Jilin Changchun, and the other is to gather for reorganization and replenishment. Because the bandit troops are exhausted, and casualties are heavy, they need to be reorganized and replenished. After days of deployment, the bandits around Siping seem to have been completed, and the war is about to break out. The bandits have not dared to attack the important industrial and mining area of ​​Benxi in southeast Shenyang.</p>
<p>[This Newspaper, Beiping, 4th] Xinmin is still tight. On the 3rd, the surrounding communist bandits used field artillery to cover and fought fiercely with the National Army in the suburbs of the northwest two cities. At dawn on the 4th, the communist bandits continued to advance from the northern suburbs to the city suburbs, and the garrison calmly fought back.

The National Army has completed its deployment in response to the bandit's situation</p>

Fan Hanjie's corps' aircraft-borne troops are advancing along the Beining Line and continue to make progress. The National Army in Tieling has also begun a counterattack from Kaiyuan, which was recently lost, and the National Army's air force and naval artillery are also fiercely bombarding Yingkou, which seems to be a prelude to the National Army's landing there.</p>
<h3>National Army in Eastern Henan Makes a Quick Victory: Recaptures Qi County, Yongcheng, and Sui County; Anti-Bandit Operations in Southern Henan Advance into Xi County</h3>

<h3>Full Text of MacArthur's Telegram to Eaton</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 3rd] The full text of MacArthur's telegram to House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Eaton is as follows:</p>
<p>"I am deeply grateful for the trust that the House Foreign Affairs Committee has placed in me by inviting me to return home to state my opinions on the China Aid policy.</p>
<p>The handling of Japanese administration is extremely complicated, especially with the recent change of government in Japan, which makes it impossible for me to leave my post even for a moment. Even if this were not the case, I would be very doubtful whether I could provide useful and constructive opinions on the details of the China Aid proposals, since I have not seen or had the opportunity to study these details to date.</p>
<p>As you may know, China is within the operational scope of the US Navy and beyond my current authority. I have no representative stationed in China, and most of the detailed information I know, apart from general history, is obtained indirectly.</p>
<p>US officials have carefully studied the Chinese situation, but this study is not within my authority and source of information, so I am not very familiar with it. Moreover, I have had no opportunity to visit China for many years. The determination of a definite policy for this particular region naturally depends on countless detailed details, but given my situation, you will understand that I am unable to provide authoritative advice on the above details.</p>
<p>Although the questions you have raised are divided into many sections, I can only answer them in general terms. I can resolutely say that an independent, free, and friendly China is of great importance to world peace and the position of the United States.</p>
<p>This is the cornerstone of the Pacific arch.</p>
<p>The root of the Chinese problem is only a military problem. Unless the military problem can be resolved, even with foreign aid, the domestic recovery is difficult to hope for. Once this problem is resolved, China's traditional recovery performance can undoubtedly become the basis for a rapid return to relative stability.</p>
<p>The orientation of American policy should consider the world situation as a whole, and the Chinese problem is only a part of it.</p>
<p>If piecemeal decisions are made in unrelated areas of the world, the overall problem will still not be solved. From the US standpoint, this problem is a global problem and can only be solved on the broadest global basis. We would be greatly mistaken if we underestimate China's needs or its importance. If we pursue a general policy of strengthening the frontiers of freedom to prevent the invasion of autocratic politics, then every major frontier is of equal importance. If we make a serious mistake in one aspect, all our efforts will be destroyed.</p>
<p>East and West are Equally Important, Asia Should Not Be Ignored</p>
<p>The Fate of the American Posterity is Tied to the Pacific</p>
<p>Due to deep-rooted racial, cultural, and commercial ties, we are easily overly focused on matters east of the United States and ignore the importance of areas west of us. The past history of the United States is deeply rooted on the other side of the Atlantic, but if the American posterity wants to keep pace with the progress of the former times, their hope is also built on the situation on the other side of the Pacific.</p>
<p>When we fully utilize the origins east of the United States, we should, on the one hand, obtain unprecedented trade and commercial opportunities by turbidizing the progress of Asian nations to seek hope for improving life for the western horizon; on the other hand, we should also pay attention to the threats that harm our lives.</p>
<p>Beyond the horizon, opposing forces are engaged in ideological struggles, war or peace, guarantee or threat, hope or fear, all depend on the outcome of the struggle and whether the balance of political, economic, and social factors can be restored.</p>
<p>Demanding Internal Political Reform Is Not the Time</p>
<p>How Can We Change the Beams When the House Is on Fire</p>
<p>The international aspect of the Chinese problem is unfortunately obscured by demands for internal political reform. Although reform is necessary, its importance is still secondary to the internal struggle that shrouds the entire China, and these two problems cannot be coordinated, just like a house is on fire, and others are still fussing about reforming its beams.</p>
<p>We have a very friendly interest in the reform of Chinese politics and hope that China can approach our ideals of freedom and fairness. It is even more important to maintain China's independence and resist the destructive forces that seek to submerge China. The reason is that when sovereignty can stand firm, reforms can naturally be carried out in an evolutionary way in the future.</p>
<p>Military Surplus Materials Should Be Fairly Allocated to China</p>
<p>Do Not Underestimate China's Strategic Importance</p>
<p>The shipment of military surplus materials beyond what we need to China has been restored. We should also measure more aid materials to China based on the fair proportion of global assistance determined by the direction of US policy. When the US policy is oriented, we should not underestimate the strategic importance of a free and peaceful China to us and the world, we should not ignore the poverty and fatigue caused by China's years of war, we should not mistake its potential for stability and the development of our future living standards, nor should we ignore the long-term friendly relations between the two countries that have been credible and strong in years of peace and war.</p>
<p>When deciding on our world policy, we should be careful not to exhaust our resources on obligations that we cannot undertake, so as to reduce our national strength and endanger our own security, so as not to burden our people and make no one maintain the living standards they deserve.</p>
<p>It is illogical for us to give up our own freedom to protect the freedom of others; it is also illogical for us to give material aid to others without hope of obtaining a contribution from the other party to the progress of mankind in return; it is also illogical for us to sacrifice ourselves and cause poverty and exhaustion elsewhere, and hinder the progress of mankind, then what is the point of our purpose?</p>
<p>The American people have always stood up in times of crisis and competed to be the first to accept the challenges of the times. This is the traditional characteristic of the American people.</p>
<p>The world is in chaos, and there has never been a greater need than today for us to accept great fearlessness and active leadership as a stabilizing force. The American people are also more willing than ever to sacrifice themselves and help others if they recognize this as a meaningful sacrifice.</p>
<p>We live on the land of the United States, making the world understand a way of life, even if it is obscured by chaos, unrest, and selfish desires, this way of life is still the hope and goal that all mankind yearns for.</p>
<p>Let us strive to maintain this way of life.</p>
<h3>Legislative Yuan Finance Committee Discusses Currency Reform Plan: Decides to Draft Recommendations to Submit to the Yuan Meeting</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 4th] The Legislative Yuan Finance Committee held a subcommittee meeting on the morning of the 4th to discuss the currency reform plan proposed by Zhang Zhaoyuan. Jian Guansan presided over the meeting, and Dai Mingli, Director of the Currency Department of the Ministry of Finance, and Wu Dazhong, Director of the Economic Research Office of the Central Bank, were present. First, Zhang reported on his plan, saying that when he was in the United States, he had discussed the possibility of restoring silver coins in China with people in the industrial and commercial circles and many congressmen, who all believed that the stability of prices in China would be of great benefit to promoting foreign trade, and that currency reform could restore the people's confidence in the value of currency, which would help to stabilize prices. He estimated that a total of 1 billion ounces of silver would be needed to cast 2 billion silver coins weighing five mace each, and maintain a certain exchange rate with foreign exchange. The current legal currency would continue to exist and be freely exchanged for silver coins at an appropriate ratio. Once the value of currency and prices are stable, paper money can be issued for circulation, and the depreciated legal currency can be gradually eliminated. Then, Director Dai stated from an official standpoint that silver coins can be used as supplementary coins, but should not be used as the main currency. The purpose of currency reform is to prevent the value of currency from falling again, but if prices cannot be stabilized, the effect of the reform is difficult to expect, so the timing of the reform does not seem to have arrived. Then, the committee members expressed their opinions, and most believed that there were many difficulties in issuing silver coins. Borrowing silver would be difficult, and the people's hoarding of silver and the Communist bandits' seizure of silver would all affect the effect of reissuing silver coins. Finally, it was decided that Zhang would organize and review the opinions and his plan and make a recommendation, and then submit it to the Yuan meeting for discussion.</p>

<h3>Transferring State-Owned Enterprises; Organizing an Underwriting Syndicate</h3>
<p>[Our newspaper, Nanjing, 4th dispatch] The principle of transferring state-owned enterprises to private management through the issuance of stocks has been approved at a previous meeting of the National Economic Council. Based on the principles decided by the National Economic Council, the Ministry of Economic Affairs has recently drafted the "Measures for the Underwriting Syndicate to Raise Funds for the Transfer of State-Owned Enterprises Through Stock Issuance." Key points of the measures are noted below:</p>
<p>(1) The government will designate national banks and bureaus to jointly organize a "Syndicate for Raising Funds for the Transfer of State-Owned Enterprises to Private Management." It will designate one bank as the convening bank. Its tasks will be to formulate the organization of new companies for each unit of the enterprises to be transferred according to government regulations, handle the issuance of new company stocks, collect the proceeds, and transfer funds.</p>
<p>(2) The syndicate will be located in Shanghai, with branch offices established in various locations where state-owned enterprises are being sold.</p>
<p>(3) The government should divide the enterprises into units based on the characteristics, scale, location, and other relevant conditions of each enterprise and designate a minimum price for each unit, with the principle that each unit can independently establish a new company.</p>
<p>(4) The syndicate should be responsible for assessing the actual value of each unit of the enterprise, determine the amount of new company capital based on the government's transfer price, and conduct public fundraising.</p>
<p>(5) After the syndicate has raised sufficient funds for each unit of the enterprise, it should promptly collect all payments, remit them to the national treasury, and convene the shareholders of the new company to establish the new company, generate the new company's responsible persons, and take over the enterprise from the government. However, to accelerate the transfer of state-owned enterprises, it may collect the already raised funds, establish the new company, and take over the enterprise from the government after more than half of the funds have been raised. The unraised amount will be temporarily considered a government investment. The government may entrust the syndicate to continue selling the unraised shares, and the price may be increased by the government at any time and remitted to the national treasury. It is also understood that after the implementation of these measures, the following goals can be achieved: (1) Truly absorb idle capital and tighten currency. (2) The people have investment opportunities. (3) The organization and management of the enterprises after the transfer will be sound and suitable for future development. (4) Comply with the principles of fairness and openness.</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>MacArthur's Brilliant Insight on Aid to China</h3>
<p>We are familiar with the calls for American aid to China. We thank our friendly nation, both the government and the public, for their concern about the China issue. We are especially impressed with General MacArthur's recent telegram to the U.S. Congress, in which he stated that military assistance should be the priority in aiding China. Military experts who have been stationed in the Far East for a long time truly have brilliant insights and foresight!</p>
<p>Since President Truman submitted the $570 million aid-to-China plan to the U.S. Congress, committees in both houses of Congress and the public have mostly believed that the amount is too small and have expressed dissatisfaction that the government did not include military assistance. Even Secretary of State Marshall himself admitted that financial assistance alone is not enough to save the Chinese government from its precarious situation. The two houses of Congress have been actively discussing the issue of aid to China recently, and have already touched upon the actual core of the problem. Ambassador to the U.S. William Bullitt testified before the House Foreign Affairs Committee on the 2nd, making an urgent appeal on the issue of aid to China. He strongly advocated for military aid to China and forcefully argued for the crisis the United States faces in the Far East. Although Mr. Bullitt's words are enough to correct the U.S. government and public's perspective on the China issue, he has been calling for their countrymen to increase their awareness of the Far East crisis since he returned to the U.S. from China, so his speech on the 2nd may be seen as old news by the American people. Chairman Eaton of the House Foreign Affairs Committee telegraphed MacArthur in Tokyo and General Chennault, the Flying Tiger General in China, requesting them to return to the country to testify, report on the actual situation in the Far East, and express their opinions on the issue of aid to China. The Flying Tiger General will soon return to the U.S. to testify, and we believe he will definitely expose the truth of the Communist rebellion, but we will put that aside for now and first discuss MacArthur's memorandum.</p>
<p>Although MacArthur has politely declined the invitation from Congress to return to the U.S. to testify, he has sent a memorandum to Washington stating his opinions on aid to China. The main points are as follows: (1) The main problem in China is military, and the military issue must be resolved first, and then economic recovery and other reforms can be discussed, so he strongly advocates military aid to China. (2) China is the basic pillar of the Pacific arch, and a free, independent, peaceful, and friendly China is extremely important for world peace and the U.S. position. (3) He warned Congress not to focus too much on European affairs due to close ethnic, cultural, and business relations. (4) It is a mistake to underestimate China's needs and its importance. (5) The United States should not only pay attention to China's reforms, but also be concerned about China's integrity to prevent destructive forces from plunging it into the abyss. (6) The Chinese government currently needs military assistance the most. (7) The China issue is part of a global issue and should be viewed from a global perspective.</p>
<p>From these opinions, it can be seen that MacArthur has never neglected China's importance in Asia, and his views are exactly what we want to say. What is especially rare is that he can bluntly point out: "Before the Communists are defeated, wanting China to complete internal reforms is like trying to change the architectural plans of a house that is being burned down." These are truly insightful and to-the-point words. His understanding of China to this extent is beyond the expectations of most people. There have been various speculations about MacArthur from the outside world. Some say that MacArthur wants to support Japan to oppose the Soviet Union, while others say that MacArthur does not value China's position in the Far East at all, but after his serious expression this time, not only can it dispel ordinary people's misunderstandings, but it can also clarify the current public opinion and allow us to gain several basic understandings.</p>
<p>First, whether it is the Democratic Party or the Republican Party in the U.S. government and the public, no one does not advocate actively carrying out aid to China. In addition to financial assistance, military assistance must be emphasized. If we conduct an objective study, there are probably two reasons why U.S. public opinion has been able to reach this further understanding: on the one hand, it is because of the deterioration of the situation in China, and politics, economics, and military affairs are originally mutually causal. Financial assistance alone, which can only alleviate China's breathing, is not enough to save China from its crisis. On the other hand, the U.S. government and public have a more accurate understanding of the situation in the Far East and are no longer deceived by the Communist Party's false propaganda. Not to mention the far-sighted diplomats, political commentators, and members of the two houses of Congress, who have unanimously expressed dissatisfaction with the government's failure to include military assistance in the aid-to-China plan, even Secretary of State Marshall, who is in charge of the aid-to-China plan, also admits that this mere $570 million in aid is useless. Now, MacArthur's opinion is being sought, and MacArthur also believes that military aid to China is necessary. From this, we believe that the U.S. government and the public will more actively advocate for military assistance to China in addition to economic assistance. The United States is a democratic country, and all domestic and foreign policies must accept the opinions of the majority of the people. Although President Truman's aid-to-China plan is limited to $570 million and does not include military assistance, judging from the current trend, the two houses of Congress may revise it. The implementation of the military aid-to-China plan is very hopeful.</p>
<p>Second, in the past six months, people have often expressed doubts about the U.S.'s actions in recent years and MacArthur's words and deeds in Tokyo, believing that the U.S. intends to neglect China and support Japan. The occurrence of this kind of doubt cannot be said to be due to the U.S. government's not clear enough attitude towards Japan. The consequence of this policy of supporting Japan is that China is the first to be directly affected by its adverse effects. In the face of threats, people in our country, both the government and the public, inevitably have fears about the U.S.'s policy towards Japan. Now, after reading MacArthur's reply, we can see that MacArthur deeply understands the importance of China's position. China is not only an important base point in Asia and is extremely important to world peace, but the changes in China's political situation and the arrogance of the Communist forces are enough to affect Japan, the Philippines, Siam, India, and even the U.S.'s position in the Far East and the Pacific will be completely changed. When Marshal Marshall debated the issue of aid to China in Congress, he said: The deterioration of the situation in Northeast China is enough to affect the U.S.'s position in Japan and Korea. Now MacArthur also specially emphasizes the importance of China to world peace and the U.S.'s position, which shows that great minds think alike. From this, the doubts of the outside world can be dispelled, and how China and the U.S. will coordinate actions in the future to jointly maintain world peace will begin with the U.S.'s implementation of military aid to China.</p>
<p>Third, until now, there are still some people in the U.S. who have been blinded by the Communist Party and its surrounding deceptive propaganda, and they do not clearly understand the "Chinese Communists." They have always believed that the "Chinese Communists" are an ordinary political party and do not believe that they are a bandit party that colludes with foreign races and conspires to seize power by violence. But after reading MacArthur's reply, they will definitely suddenly realize. The "Chinese Communists" not only completely obey Moscow, but the "Chinese Communists'" military disturbances are precisely a part of the "world violent revolution" instigated by totalitarian countries. If the "Chinese Communists" succeed and also organize a communist regime in China, then China will become an appendage of the totalitarian country. How can there be any democracy or freedom? The recent coup in Czechoslovakia is an excellent example! At the beginning of the victory, the "Chinese Communists" also sang the slogan of a "united government," and the atmosphere of political consultation also seemed extremely fashionable, but it is not known that even if it succeeded at that time, it would be difficult to guarantee that the "Chinese Communists" would not launch another "coup." Therefore, compromise with the "Chinese Communists" has proved that this path does not work. Today, American friends can have this understanding, which is of great benefit to understanding the China issue: it is also equivalent to preparing to inject a vaccine to prevent war in the Far East.</p>
<p>In short, for the sake of Sino-American cooperation, for the sake of peace in the Far East, and for the sake of the future of democracy and freedom, we sincerely welcome the brilliant insights of MacArthur and other visionaries on military aid to China!</p>

<h3>China Society for Social and Economic Research Denies Being a Political Organization; Song Ziwen Has Not Donated Funds</h3>
<p>[Our newspaper, Beiping, 4th dispatch] After the China Society for Social and Economic Research, initiated by Qian Changzhao, Zhou Binglin, Wu Jingchao, and others, was established in Beiping, its movements have attracted attention from all parties. Especially since the society was established after Ambassador Stuart released his letter to the Chinese people, there were rumors that the society was brewing a "new third party" and launching a "movement for the great unity of intellectuals." Wu Jingchao, the spokesperson of the society, denied the above speculations in an interview with reporters on the 3rd, stating that the society is not a political organization, but also admitting that the society hopes to have political influence. A reporter asked: Will the society suggest its research results on politics, diplomacy, and economics to the government? Wu replied: "We are not preparing to submit a letter to anyone. Publishing it to the society is equivalent to suggesting it!" Sun Yueqi also denied rumors that he had contact with Zhang Bojun and others when he passed through Hong Kong. Wu Jingchao also denied that the society had received funding from Song Ziwen. In addition to membership fees, the society plans to raise funds from industrialists, but will definitely not raise funds from those with political affiliations, and this fundraising will definitely not allow donors to interfere with the affairs of the society. A reporter asked: Why didn't Hu Shi participate in the society? Wu replied: "I visited Mr. Hu and explained that the establishment of this society is because Principal Hu is highly respected, so it is not convenient to invite him suddenly. I have asked Mr. Hu to submit articles after the New Road Weekly is published if he thinks it is appropriate." The society's "New Road Weekly" is planned to be published in May, and the editors are Qian Duansheng (Lou Bangyan will act as an editor before Qian returns to China), Wu Bannong in politics, Liu Dazhong in economics, Xiao Qian in diplomacy and literature, and Wu Jingchao in society.</p>

<h3>Ode to Mahatma Gandhi, Mengchun of the Wuzi Year of the Republic of China 37</h3>
<p>— Respectfully Made and Written by Dai Shixian</p>
<p>Ode to Mahatma Gandhi Made Respectfully by Dai Shixian</p>
<p>First Chapter: Great Saint, Four Verses of Four Sentences</p>
<p>Respect the planting of all compassion in the world. I pre-create and praise its truthfulness and infallibility. A saint is born in troubled times. The saint's intention is to save the world. If one asks why there is chaos, it is all caused by human laziness. Human nature is not inherently evil, but evil is caused by habit. Remove the impurities and restore purity. The saint is forbearing and does not retaliate, returning with an equal outlook. The saint, with a compassionate heart, sacrifices himself to save people in the world.</p>
<p>Second Chapter: East and West Share the Same Path, Nine Verses of Four Sentences</p>
<p>In the West, there is a saint named Christ, who sacrificed himself on the cross to redeem the sins of the world. He endured all kinds of suffering but never harbored resentment. He died but his teachings shined in all directions, and all people returned to reverence. In the East, there is a saint called Confucius, who was cut off between Chen and Cai but continued to practice the Way until his death. Although he suffered hardship, his great Way moved people's hearts. His supreme virtue extended to all generations, and the whole world returned to benevolence. King Wen endured great hardship and returned to his beautiful home after seven years. His saintly influence spread throughout the world, and the Zhou Dynasty rose from the mountains. In India, Shakyamuni was born, with a grand heart. He practiced asceticism in the snowy mountains and ultimately attained enlightenment. Those who walked with him left traces. Devadatta was greedy for fame and profit and acted with deceitful intentions, creating great evil and disrupting harmony. He threw stones at Shakyamuni Buddha, and although his body bled, believers were as numerous as the sands of the river. The World Honored One attained Nirvana and restored the teachings, which have been passed down to this day. Truly, he is compassionate and sacrifices himself for all beings.</p>
<p>Third Chapter: Treating Enemies and Relatives Equally, Four Verses of Four Sentences</p>
<p>Saints and sages are so numerous that they cannot be counted. Becoming a person is about accepting suffering, or sacrificing oneself for the Way. Saints often suffer hardship. Saints often suffer hardships, and ultimately they embody the suffering, becoming the savior of the world. Saints do not resent people, saints do not scold people. They treat enemies and relatives equally, and their sole ambition is to love people. They are greatly praised as loving all, and also praised as compassionate or benevolent. Although the names are different, they all return to the same goal.</p>
<p>Fourth Chapter: Ignorance and Patience Alike, Seven Verses of Four Sentences</p>
<p>The world suffers from foolish people who do not know the importance of sages and reverence. The fire of desire attacks their hearts, and they become狂乱and destroy everything. They turn back to greed and anger, and turning back to anger, they desire enjoyment. They harm themselves and others, and people and I are both disadvantaged. There are also those who are foolish and who follow evil with joy, wrongly recognizing evil as good. It is pitiful, like this is foolish and always wants to obstruct the saintly path. The saintly path is equal to heaven and earth and ultimately cannot be obstructed. These foolish people妄扭機as pure and devote themselves to the burning house.仇火丑白weak people become鼠竊and strong people become盜賊. Small ones are都人物and big ones become成人國. Actions have大小, but evil has no壽. Ignorance is its回, and the chaos in the world is caused by岭凈.</p>
<p>Fifth Chapter: Stealing Fire and Sage Wisdom, Six Verses of Four Sentences</p>
<p>Sages are not born into the world, they are born to save the world. Their saintly virtue touches people's hearts and returns chaos to order. I often advise that the teachings of Yi are difficult, and the sages are difficult to compare. Practicing with repeated dangers and repeated brightness will then follow it. The virtue of the Jiu hexagram is constant. One practices by teaching and learning. The affairs are gentle on the outside and strong on the inside, based on righteousness and not on profit. The virtue of the Chongming hexagram is to inherit brightness and illuminate all directions. It is strong on the outside and soft on the inside, so it can express great meaning. Sages transform the world, and their ambition is to make civilization known. First, they suffer and work hard,走為習坎行.</p>
<p>Sixth Chapter: Mahatma is Born into the World, Six Verses of Four Sentences</p>
<p>I am saddened by the people of the world, viewing the dark landscape. Suffering has accumulated deeply, and the globe is suffering great disasters. Bringing order out of chaos will be like a將焾. The ancient and modern are not different, and 重險is屯at this time. Thus, Gandhi was born, a saint who comes forth to save the world. He was born on the恒河and made a great vow to save the world. He is compassionate and pitiful, and he stands by establishing people by establishing himself, so he values苦修.待戒is the first, because this is the丹of wisdom. Loving others is from loving oneself, so he first stands with virtue. Saving the world is from saving oneself, so he first saves the country. How can India be saved? By establishing faith as its door, he restores the old teachings to achieve new civilization.</p>
<p>Seventh Chapter: Saint's Certainty and Sincere Teaching, Nine Verses of Four Sentences</p>
<p>The most important thing to save people is to return without greed. Loving people and living frugally are easy to know but difficult to do. Greed is the囤of anger. Killing is the first. In order to protect this goodness, this is what it means to be vegetarian. In this way, the heart is always happy. This is the foundation of明德. No longer eating after noon, pure actions bring peace and tranquility. The heart accumulates from desire, and desires 重俗德.芳茨does not labor. From this body, make a model.

<h3>Belgian Prime Minister Presides Over Opening Ceremony, Five Countries Confer on Western European Alliance, Continues with Secret Meeting to Discuss Anglo-French Draft</h3>
<p>[Reuters Brussels 4th Dispatch] The conference of five countries, Britain, France, the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg, to discuss the Western European alliance opened today at the Belgian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, presided over in person by the Belgian Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Spaak. The flags of the five countries were also inserted on the building of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Spaak delivered a short opening speech in the external conference room, saying:</p>
<p>"We are meeting here today at a time when European freedom is nearing its end, to find a way to bridge the natural divisions between our countries and organize a political and economic group. It is self-evident that we are forced to take this action by the squeeze of communist forces. Communism has already destroyed the once proud countries of Poland, Hungary, and Czechoslovakia, and is now approaching Finland. When British Foreign Secretary Bevin put forward the proposal to unite the resources of Western European countries and their territories, very few people believed that this plan could be completed in our generation. However, now, only forty days after the proposal was put forward, we know that Mr. Bevin's plan is not an empty talk. Today, we have no choice but to accept his proposal, because his proposal is no longer just an empty proposal. We must unite, abandon prejudices, and build our resources to be a great bulwark of freedom-loving countries, strengthening our strength to deal with the East. You are starting the work of the Western European Alliance plan today, and you will start studying a draft treaty. This treaty, politically and economically, and also necessarily militarily, will unite our five European countries and overseas African territories. Our common future may stem from this. You are all aware of the urgency of the situation, and I will not say much more, but I ask you to start work, because time is very urgent and there is not much left."</p>
<p>After Spaak presided over the opening ceremony, he withdrew from the venue. Representatives and experts from the five countries then began a secret meeting. The British and French delegations have brought a draft of the five-country treaty, the main points of which include: (1) The Western European Alliance should include Britain, France, the Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg, and Italy. The Iberian Peninsula countries and Scandinavian countries will be invited to consider joining. (2) Any treaty to which Western European countries will participate should include accepting mutual assistance, even going to war, to assist any ally of the alliance that is attacked by a country outside the alliance in violation of the United Nations Charter, on the principle of mutual assistance. (3) The allied countries should exchange military groups, defense plans, weapons, and equipment. (4) In terms of economy, efforts should be made to reduce tariff barriers immediately in accordance with the International Trade Charter and the provisions of the Havana Conference. The British and French draft also stipulates ways to develop European resources to provide a source of supply for "free Europe." American personnel in Belgium believe that the draft five-country alliance will definitely be produced after the meeting. Although Britain did not participate in the meeting, it will be notified of the progress of the meeting at any time, as will the British Commonwealth countries.</p>
<h3>Three Powers Discuss the West German Question, Meeting May End Today, Compensation Issues and the Merger of the Three Zones Have Been Discussed</h3>
<p>[Reuters London 3rd Dispatch] The West German question, which is closely related to the future of the Western European Alliance plan, is expected to be answered before the end of Friday's London Three Powers Conference. (1) After Britain, the United States, France, the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg report the results of this meeting to their respective governments, will they stipulate a date for the continuation of the German question talks? (2) The small group tasked with studying important issues such as the Ruhr International Regime will submit a report before the end of this plenary session, or will it continue to discuss after the end of this plenary session.</p>
<p>Spokespersons for the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg raised this question at the meeting yesterday, and the British representative, Stroumbold, who chaired the meeting, has guaranteed that he will answer later. If this meeting is successful, certain permanent institutions should be established to prepare the six participating countries to exchange views on permanent issues. The Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg did not participate in the second half of yesterday's meeting, and the agenda was the compensation issue, meaning the part of the compensation issue that the three powers of Britain, the United States, and France need to decide in their capacity as occupying countries. According to reliable sources, Dutch representative Van Doornan reiterated that all compensation issues are of interest to the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg. The representatives of the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg still did not attend today's meeting, so it is expected that the discussion was about the merger of the three occupied zones of West Germany. With only two days left until the closing date, it is expected that representatives from the six countries will participate in the meeting on the 4th. The land issue has not yet been discussed, or it should be raised for discussion on the 4th.</p>
<h3>Turkey Agrees to Participate in Sixteen-Country Conference</h3>
<p>British and American Fleets Will Visit Turkish Ports</p>
<p>[Reuters Ankara 4th Dispatch] Turkey has accepted the invitation from Britain and France today and promised to participate in the Marshall Plan Paris Conference on March 15.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse Ankara 4th Dispatch] According to Turkish newspapers, British and American fleets will visit Turkish ports on the 16th. It is heard that the fleet visiting Turkey this time includes the aircraft carrier "Midway" and will visit the two Turkish ports of Smyrna and Istanbul.</p>
<h3>France and Italy Will Sign Customs Union</h3>
<p>[United Press Paris 4th Dispatch] The French Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced that Foreign Minister Bidault will soon go to Turin to sign a French-Italian customs union treaty with Italian Foreign Minister Sforza. The French government believes that the treaty will be of great benefit to the economies of the two countries.</p>
<h3>Michael Announces He Was Forced to Abdicate, Foreign Instigation Behind the Scenes</h3>
<p>[Our Report] London 4th Broadcast; Former Romanian King Michael publicly stated for the first time today that his abdication was due to the coercion of the Communist Party. He still recognizes himself as the actual king, which shows that he still intends to restore the throne when the time is right in the future. Although he did not directly name the Soviet Union, he asked the Romanian Communist Party to force his abdication. The action was instigated behind the scenes by a foreign country, and the Communist Party government cannot represent public opinion at all.</p>
<h3>Italy Plans to Conclude Friendship Treaties with China, Britain, and France</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse Rome 3rd Dispatch] Italy intends to negotiate friendship treaties with China and France. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs is now planning to conclude the same treaty with Britain, hoping to have preliminary talks with the governments concerned in the near future.</p>
<h3>Bevin Says British Territory in Antarctica Will Never Be Abandoned</h3>
<p>Protests to Guatemala for Attacks on British Consulate</p>
<p>[United Press London 3rd Dispatch] Foreign Secretary Bevin told the Lower House that the recent landings by Argentina and Chile on British territory in Antarctica were illegal. Although the British naval power has been reduced compared to before the war, the country must protect its rights in Antarctica. Bevin also guaranteed that Britain still has sufficient strength to protect British Honduras from aggression.</p>
<p>[Reuters London 3rd Dispatch] The British Minister to Guatemala lodged a note with the Guatemalan Foreign Minister yesterday, severely protesting the dishonorable events that occurred in Guatemala City yesterday. The protest stated: Yesterday afternoon, the demonstration in front of the British Embassy, in addition to removing the British flag and hanging the Guatemalan flag, also hung a pirate flag with a skull pattern on the flagpole.</p>
<h3>British Upper House Debates Foreign Policy, Condemns Imitation of Hitler's Threat to Peace</h3>
<p>[Reuters London 3rd Dispatch] The House of Lords held a foreign policy debate on the 3rd, involving the expansion of Soviet power in Eastern Europe and the recent events in Czechoslovakia and Finland. Lord Pakenham, speaking on behalf of the government, compared the Communist Party's seizure of power in Czechoslovakia to Hitler's methods, believing it to be a premeditated action. He also said that Finland will soon follow suit and has been kissed by death. He also said that one of the lessons that can be learned from recent events is that no group, whether it is a government, a trade union, or any other institution, can allow the Communist Party to participate, otherwise these groups will be swallowed up by the Communist Party sooner or later. Opposition leader Salisbury said that the Soviet Union's policy has adopted a new and terrible approach. Hitler's personality has been found in Soviet decision-makers, just like Germany's annexation of Czechoslovakia and aggression against the Soviet Union. Today's Soviet Union has also included Poland, Romania, Czechoslovakia, and Hungary. Although Britain is willing to maintain good relations with the Soviet Union, the events of the past week have made it impossible for it to ignore the threat that is once again enveloping all of Europe. The question from now on is no longer to avoid the division of Europe, but to prevent the East from annexing Western Europe. What is exciting is Britain's decision to unite Western Europe. He hopes that Foreign Secretary Bevin can go to Belgium in person to achieve rapid and effective results. Former chief diplomatic advisor to the British government Vansittart also said that Stalin has taken the risk of starting a war in Europe, just like Hitler. From now on, Britain's pro-Stalinism should be viewed with the same eyes as Hitler, and treaties with totalitarian countries must not be trusted. The events in Czechoslovakia should mark the end of the period of fantasy.</p>

<h3>British-Soviet Trade Agreement, Trading Weapons for Food, British Members of Parliament Express Opposition</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency London 3rd Associated Press] British MP Robertson said in the Lower House that according to the British-Soviet trade and financial agreement, Britain will send weapons of war to the Soviet Union. He said that the price of purchasing livestock and other food with heavy industrial machinery, that is, weapons of war, is too high. If the allied countries, autonomous territories, and colonies of the British continent feel that we are supplying the potential for war to a country that does nothing but war, we will be greatly disturbed. He requested the abolition of this agreement. Lower House member Stock also opposed this agreement because Britain should not trade with a country that confines seventeen to twenty million people to slave labor camps.</p>
<h3>Western Europe Is Strained Financially and Urgently Needs US Aid</h3>
<p>US Loans to Britain Have Been Completely Used Up</p>
<p>[Reuters Washington 3rd Dispatch] US Deputy Secretary of State Lovett said at a press conference today that Western European countries have now declared that they are using the funds they have obtained. If Congress does not pass the Marshall Plan on April 1, the financial situation of Western European countries will become more and more difficult. France is particularly lacking in US dollars, and several other countries have also "gone to the edge."</p>
<p>[Reuters Washington 3rd Dispatch] The US Treasury Department announced today that Britain has used all of the $3.75 billion it borrowed from the US. The last $100 million was obtained on Monday of this week. The huge loan was originally expected to last for three to five years, but as a result, it was used up in 20 months.</p>
<h3>Finland's Final Attitude Towards Soviet Proposals Awaits Decision</h3>
<p>[United Press Gothenburg, Sweden 4th Dispatch] Five political parties in Finland are expected to decide on their position on Soviet proposals tonight, but will not submit a response to the president until five days later.</p>
<h3>China and Canada Oppose US Proposal, Support Belgian Amendment, Advocate Prior Investigation of Holy Land Situation</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Lake Success, 3rd] The Security Council met today with Chinese representative Jiang Tingfu serving as rotating chairman. China and Canada jointly opposed accepting the principle of partitioning Palestine without first investigating the entire issue. China and Canada both support the Belgian amendment, opposing the acceptance of the partition principle in the US resolution without a full investigation into the possibility that the situation in Palestine threatens peace. The Canadian representative, McNaughton, supported the appointment of an advisory committee to the Security Council and urged the five powers to resolve the issue through mediation. Chinese representative Jiang Tingfu pointed out the contradiction in the US position, stating that while the US claims it does not intend to use force to support the UN General Assembly's partition resolution, it simultaneously supports the Security Council using force if necessary to thwart threats to international peace. The Council subsequently announced a postponement of the session to Friday. (Note: The Soviet Union has, in principle, expressed acceptance of the US proposal; see yesterday's dispatch.)</p>
<p>[United Press, Lake Success, 3rd] China and Canada today blocked the US attempt to have the Security Council swiftly approve the Palestine partition plan. Both countries stated that the five powers should exert their utmost efforts to reach an agreement to resolve the Palestine issue. It is considered certain that the US chief representative Austin's proposal will not be approved by the Security Council.</p>
<h3>US Republican Lawmakers Advocate Military Alliance Against Soviet Union, Vandenberg Expresses Disagreement</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 4th] Republican Senator Wiley stated that a military alliance against the Soviet Union is necessary, claiming that the UN has ceased to function due to the Soviet Union's use of the veto, and that "we should seek every means." He, along with [Senator] Kem and several other Republican senators, advocated using force if necessary to halt the "Soviet Union's aggression agenda." Reportedly, Senate leader Vandenberg believes that this proposal would weaken Western Europe's self-help revival plan and could jeopardize the future of the United Nations. Baur's proposal stipulates that the President and Secretary of State immediately begin negotiations with other UN member states to organize a new eleven-nation "Supreme Council" to take over the peacekeeping powers currently held by the Security Council. Prior to joining the "Supreme Council," each nation should guarantee that, if seven of the eleven nations, including more than half of the major powers, decide that force must be used to maintain peace, that nation will contribute its military forces.</p>
<h3>Japanese Socialist Party Consultations Result in Decision that Katayama Will Not Join Cabinet, Three-Party Leaders Meeting Therefore Postponed</h3>
<p>[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 4th] State Minister Takeda, at the behest of Democratic Party Secretary-General Ashida, visited Socialist Party Chairman Katayama on the morning of the 4th, inviting him to attend the three-party leaders' meeting on the 4th. At the same time, he proposed that Katayama join the cabinet as Foreign Minister, before attending the three-party leaders' meeting. However, Katayama responded with a reservation, promising to reply by the 9th. However, at 2 PM, President Ashida and Takeda met with Katayama again, inviting him to join the cabinet as Foreign Minister, but Katayama firmly declined. After the meeting, the Socialist Party convened a Central Executive Committee to discuss Katayama's cabinet entry. As a result of the discussions, no one supported it, and it was decided that someone other than Katayama would participate in the Ashida Cabinet to cooperate. Therefore, Katayama visited Ashida again, replying that he could not join the cabinet.</p>
<p>Takeda then announced: "For the stability of the current political situation, the Socialist Party leader Katayama's joining the cabinet is absolutely necessary, so it was decided that Prime Minister Ashida will visit Katayama again on the 5th to make another earnest request." Therefore, the three-party leaders' meeting of the Socialists, Democrats, and People's Cooperative Party, scheduled to be held on the 4th, was postponed to the 5th.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 4th] It is expected that Katayama's refusal to participate in the cabinet will cause Ashida to lose a large part of his stabilizing force.</p>
<p>[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 4th] The preparatory committee of the conservative new party organized by the Yoshida faction in Japan has been actively carrying out organizational work recently because the policy agreement of the Ashida cabinet has been successfully concluded, preparing to submit a motion of no confidence in the Ashida cabinet in the Diet in the future, or to demand the dissolution of the Diet and re-election. It is heard that the preparatory committee has drafted the party platform, party discipline, and policies yesterday, and after several consultations to determine the party name, it can hold a founding meeting on the 15th.</p>
<h3>Japan's Enslavement of Our Laborers Will Be Tried by Military Law</h3>
<p>US-China Joint Military Tribunal Organized</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 4th] Several Japanese Class A war criminals will be tried by the soon-to-be-established Sino-American joint military tribunal for the wartime transportation of "slave laborers" from our country. Many Japanese notables, including industrial leaders, police chiefs, and army officers, who are accused of participating in drafting and implementing the "slave labor" policy, will also be prosecuted.</p>
<h3>World Rice Conference Passes Indian Proposal</h3>
<p>General Assembly's Three Committees Have Begun Work</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Baguio, 3rd] Three of the four committees established by the plenary session of the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization Rice Conference have begun work today. Sixteen national agricultural experts gathered to study various rice problems from a narrower perspective, thereby putting forward proposals aimed at preventing famine in Asia. The Rice Trade and Distribution Committee decided to prohibit reporters from attending, so as to freely exchange frank opinions on many advanced technical issues and avoid being "distortedly reported." It is reported that the committee, after working all day, only adopted India's proposals, namely: (1) each country should adopt its own standards of weight and measure; (2) each country should submit reports of its production and international trade statistics in metric tons and hectares; (3) The Food and Agriculture Organization may be required to consult with international agencies studying weights and measures to investigate and submit a report at the next meeting.</p>

<h3>Hull's Memoirs (10)(4)</h3>

<p>Missing Old Friends Truly Makes One Overwhelmed with Sorrow</p>
<p>On July 20, 1944, some time before Roosevelt was nominated in Chicago to compete for his fourth term as president, he again suggested at the White House that I be nominated as vice president. He said he knew that if I were willing, I could get the nomination.</p>
<p>But the President knew I wouldn't accept it, because the war was still going on and I was immersed in diplomatic work. Just as I had repeatedly refused similar proposals in 1940, I felt that in this situation, I could contribute more as Secretary of State than as Vice President. I expressed my gratitude for the President's kindness, but said that I was concentrating on foreign policy and didn't think I could disrupt it.</p>
<p>A fourth term seemed more natural to the public, including myself, than a third. The tradition had already been broken.</p>
<p>In 1944 we were at war, while in 1940 we were not. The President felt the situation was difficult, we were like in the vast ocean, and he was at the helm. So he should give way to the general demand and run for re-election again.</p>
<p>I did not participate in the subsequent election campaign.</p>
<p>The President sent me a memorandum, dated September 29, 1944, in which he said: "I very much hope that when you make plans, you can manage to broadcast speeches twice between now and election day. The country needs your clear thinking and needs to stay informed at all times."</p>
<p>He then said he wanted to give a speech on foreign policy between then and election day, and if I could draft it for him, he would be "forever very grateful."</p>
<p>When I received this memorandum, I was preparing to visit the President at the White House next Sunday and inform him that I would resign. I visited him on the scheduled date, and in a mood of profound disappointment, I told the President that I had worked hard for a considerable time, and now I found that my health was such that I had to resign. I said I would leave the office in the next day or two and go straight to bed, and I would have to stay there, I didn't know how long.</p>
<p>The President didn't seem to believe me. Before I left his office, we talked rather casually. The issue of preparing speeches for him and my giving two campaign speeches was not mentioned at the time or thereafter, although the State Department later helped the President prepare his main foreign policy speeches during the campaign.</p>
<p>Three days later, October 2, which was my seventy-third birthday, I left the State Department, already a person plagued with illnesses. I spent eighteen days in my apartment trying to recover, but to no avail. During this period, I continued to do some work, after which I was sent to the Naval Hospital in Bethesda, Maryland, where I stayed for about seven months, and sometimes my condition was extremely serious. The astonishing tension of nearly twelve years in the State Department completely exhausted me, because it was during one of the most serious periods in our country's life, and no term of office of any Secretary of State in history was even half as long as mine.</p>
<p>Shortly after arriving at the hospital, the President sent White House physician Admiral McIntyre to diagnose my condition and make me believe that in a reasonable time, I could fully recover and resume my duties. Then the President came to visit me, stayed for an hour and a half, and at that time he urged me not to resign as the best policy. He guaranteed that I could take leave for a period of time and return to the State Department's office after a reasonable period of time.</p>
<p>I did not hesitate but quickly expressed my unwillingness not to resign. I said that the pain of resigning after my huge plans to which I had devoted myself had not been adopted was second only to losing my life. But I also said that in order to promote these great efforts, I had almost exhausted my energy, and on the ladder of my physical strength, I had been reduced to the lowest level. I said that I could not continue to hold office and assume its extraordinary responsibilities on the one hand and try to recover my health on the other.</p>
<p>The President then did his best to urge me not to resign until his current term ended on January 20, 1945. I replied that, personally, I would be extremely happy to do so, but I pointed out that if I did so, critics would almost immediately notice the major responsibilities falling on me and the State Department, and would sympathize with my illness on the one hand, and on the other hand would soon insist that the urgent nature of the current situation required a Secretary of State to be seated in the State Department, and as a result, they would criticize the President for mishandling things.</p>
<p>Mr. Roosevelt then asked me not to resign temporarily, at least until after the election. I agreed to this.</p>
<p>On November 21, the President wrote me a wonderful letter, beginning by saying that my letter "put me in a dilemma." He continued, "It makes me extremely uncomfortable just to think that our close relationship of twelve years is about to end. This is not only because our relationship has always been extremely harmonious, or because our joint work has achieved success in so many ways, but more because of my personal feelings, that is, from now on I will no longer be able to rely on your help and your kind exchange of opinions.</p>
<p>"I feel this way especially because we have come so far on the road to friendly relations internationally, and I am very eager to rely on your help to bring this work to its final stage in the current situation, which is still extremely complex and difficult.</p>
<p>"Your health is indeed of the utmost concern, and I truly believe that you can recover in a relatively short period of time, even if in the future you can limit yourself to special work and avoid the daily affairs of the State Department. So today, you must focus all your thoughts on getting well soon, and all your friends will help you with this."</p>
<p>He then repeated his suggestion that I continue to practice until the fourth term began, saying:</p>
<p>"If you must do this, I will of course accept your resignation as Secretary of State. But I hope you will agree to a compromise, that is, allow me to accept it when our third term ends on January 20. Perhaps there is a little bit of emotional effect in this, but it will make me feel happy from the bottom of my heart if we can complete the third term. That is to say, there are still two months, and during this time I can often come to see you and listen to your opinions on some of the things we may encounter."</p>
<p>The President then made a suggestion, and if I could accept it, it would indeed be most intimate to my heart. He said, "I mention in passing that when the United Nations is established, I will continue to pray that you, as the father of the United Nations, will be able to serve as chairman at its first meeting. This has nothing to do with whether you are still Secretary of State at this time, and the position should be held by you, because you are the one in the world who has contributed the most to making this great peace plan a concrete reality. You have contributed to friendly relations internationally in so many different ways, so even if you are no longer serving in government, you will continue to help the world with your moral guidance."</p>
<p>He ended the letter with words of concern.</p>
<p>The President's plea was so touching to my heart that I did indeed have a sincere conversation with the doctors who were treating me. Their reply was that I would not be able to return to my office for a long time in the future. So I thought that accepting the President's suggestion to stay in office until January 20 would not be fair to the government or to myself. A new Secretary of State should be appointed to replace me. And I felt that as the head of the State Department, I should be responsible for foreign policy, but I was not actively involved in the formulation of these policies.</p>
<p>So on November 23, I replied to the President, telling him that I was deeply moved by his letter, and would always be grateful for his sincere concern for my health and for his praise of our twelve years of close personal and official relationship. After reiterating the personal tragedy that my health situation made it impossible for me to continue in public service, and that I would always cherish our friendship and affection, I said:</p>
<p>"I sincerely hope to be able to fulfill your wish, that is, my resignation as Secretary of State may not take effect now but on January 20. I have consulted with my doctor again. The speed of my recovery is certainly related to avoiding all worries and responsibilities. You must be able to understand that as long as I am the Secretary of State, I cannot put aside the important responsibilities of the Secretary of State. In order to be loyal to you and the goals we have always pursued, loyal to the country, loyal to you, and loyal to myself, I feel that my resignation must take effect now."</p>
<p>I repeated that as soon as my health recovered, I would be completely at your command, and I would be happy to engage in anything that I could personally contribute to the solution of major problems in the future.</p>
<p>The President now accepted my resignation and announced it on November 27. He appointed Undersecretary of State Stettinius to succeed me. My term officially ended on November 30, 1944.</p>
<p>The President came to see me at the hospital several times. One time, he looked very tired—at that time he was only a few weeks away from death—I was lying in bed, and he said to me, "I should be where you are."</p>
<p>During the long seven months I spent in the hospital, I was often cheered by signs that, although I was no longer in office, my work had not been forgotten.</p>
<p>I received a telegram from the Yalta Conference, signed by Roosevelt, Stalin, Churchill, Molotov, Eden and Stettinius, saying: "We send you our heartfelt greetings for not being with us at this meeting. We hope you recover quickly so that we can all be together again."</p>
<p>I should state here that neither the President nor anyone else consulted with me on policy issues before or during the Yalta Conference. When the President was about to depart for Yalta, he came to see me at the hospital, but did not mention to me any of the topics he expected to discuss with Stalin and Churchill or any decisions he might make. I was not notified in advance of the objectives of our government at any other important meeting thereafter, with the exception of the San Francisco Conference.</p>
<p>Two months after the Yalta Conference, I was stunned by the sudden death of President Roosevelt on April 12. He had come to see me the day before going to Hyde Park and then to Warm Springs, Georgia. A few days later, he died there. When he came to see me this time, I advised him to pay attention to his health and said he should rest more. He said he was leaving the next day for that purpose.</p>
<p>In my opinion, President Roosevelt was the greatest social reformer in our modern history, even if many people may disagree with some of his reforms. As Commander-in-Chief, his achievements stand out among those of other Commanders-in-Chief. In my opinion, he was unmatched in political skill in his time. As far as I know, he has always been a sincere believer in personal freedom and other fundamental rights and privileges, which are necessary for ordinary citizens. These include the ideals of justice, law and order. In terms of views, he was strong, consistent and often extremely liberal. The steps he took militarily led us directly to victory, and these steps also had the greatest significance diplomatically, because military success gave our diplomacy indispensable support and strength.</p>

<h3>Resolutions of the Assembly of Councillors: Request to Suspend the Livestock Market; Postpone the Enforcement of the Dance Ban</h3>
<p>Emergency Motion to Support the Chairman as the First President; Requesting a Telegram to the US Government and Public to Implement Full-Scale Aid to China</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Dispatch] Yesterday was the tenth day of the fifth general meeting of the Municipal Assembly of Councillors. The eighth meeting was held in the afternoon to continue discussing proposals regarding civil affairs, society, and public works. The meeting was originally scheduled to adjourn yesterday, but due to the large number of proposals for discussion, it was decided to extend it by two days, adjourning at 7 p.m. tomorrow.</p>
<p>Speaker Pan, Deputy Speaker Xu, and Councillors Gao Shu'an, Yang Gongmou (Social Democratic Party), Wang Xingguo (Youth Party), and forty-one others, jointly submitted an emergency proposal yesterday: "Proposing that the Assembly unanimously support Chairman Chiang Kai-shek of the National Government as the first president." A vote will be requested from the Assembly today. Furthermore, Cheng Qian, Director of the Wuhan Headquarters, recently sent a letter to the Municipal Assembly of Councillors, also requesting support for Chairman Chiang Kai-shek as the first president. The original letter stated: "With the election approaching, our Chairman Chiang has led the revolution, pacifying internally and resisting externally, with great achievements that have shaken the past and present. In the future, suppressing the rebellion and building the nation will be a heavy responsibility and a long journey. The position of president is destined for him. Although he is occupied with countless affairs every day and has no time to compete in the election, our national public opinion should be expressed. The public opinion organs of Hubei Province are holding regular meetings and sending special telegrams to attending representatives, unanimously supporting him. The people of your city must share this sentiment, and we hope you will lead all sectors to respond unanimously."</p>
<p>In addition, there was an emergency motion by the Speaker, Deputy Speaker, and fourteen councillors including Wang Wei-yin, stating: "The communist bandits are destroying national unity and hindering the great plan for revival. The severity of this problem not only concerns the safety of China but also affects peace in the Far East. At this critical military juncture, our government should renew its politics, improve its economy, rectify its military, and strive for revitalization in order to quickly suppress the bandit rebellion. However, after a long period of war, our country is exhausted, and the people are suffering. We must appeal to our allies for assistance. Recent reports indicate that the US government has proposed an economic aid plan for China, but it is still under discussion and does not include military aid, which is still too slow to address the overall situation in China. This Assembly, representing the citizens of the entire city, should not only urge our government to promptly implement thorough political, economic, financial, and military reforms but also send a telegram to the US government and public, based on the people's standpoint, urging them not to delay full-scale aid to China any longer. Effective measures should be implemented quickly to stabilize our economy, strengthen our military, eliminate the bandit atmosphere, restore construction, and share the mission of preventing human warfare and ensuring lasting world peace with our allies. Is this appropriate? We respectfully request your decision." This case will also be decided in today's general meeting.</p>
<p>Diverse Speeches and Statements: Abuses of the Livestock Market</p>
<p>The proposals discussed yesterday regarding the social sector: (1) During the general meeting, there were diverse expressions of opposition to the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry's plan to establish a jointly run public-private Shanghai Livestock Market Co., Ltd. The original proposal stated that it "controls and exploits, harms merchants and people, and requests that the Municipal Government forward the proposal to the Central Government to order the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry to abolish it." Ge Yuping, a specialist from the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, made a special trip to the meeting to explain that the livestock market is in the planning stage, and the government has no intention of increasing the people's burden. He personally has no preconceived notions about this, and if the Assembly believes that it should be postponed or not implemented, it can advise the Ministry of Agriculture. However, the rationality of the principle and the need for the system should be considered. Whether the management is perfect is a matter of personnel.

Director Wu Kaixian of the Social Affairs Bureau also repeatedly stated that if the Central Government does not indicate, it will not automatically implement the ban. The original proposal for the case was "Please severely punish the masterminds of the thugs who destroyed the Social Affairs Bureau, release the innocent, and rescind the order to ban dancing to promote the rule of law and pacify the good people." The Assembly passed three resolutions: (1) Send a letter to the government requesting that the thugs who destroyed the Social Affairs Bureau be severely punished according to the law, and that those with insufficient evidence of guilt be released quickly. (2) Considering that stability is the top priority during this period of suppression, Shanghai's dance halls have a long history, and a large number of people are employed, with no fewer than tens of thousands directly or indirectly relying on them for a living. The situation is indeed different from other cities. Therefore, before the job transition of dance hall employees and dancers is properly resolved, the Municipal Government should continue to be requested to forward the resolution of the previous Assembly to the Central Government to postpone enforcement. (3) Send a letter to the Municipal Government requesting that the Social Affairs Bureau postpone the enforcement of the order on dance halls that have not yet been selected until new instructions are received from the Central Government.</p>

(7) It is proposed that the Municipal Government formulate provisional measures for the treatment of vocational workers in this city, and after review and approval by this Assembly, promulgate and implement them to stabilize society.

He said: The relationship between China and the United Kingdom has always been very friendly. After this wireless telephone call, the friendship and cooperation between China and the United Kingdom will enter a new stage. He sincerely hopes that the wireless telephone call will help the prosperity and welfare of the two countries. Smith thanked Mayor Wu for his call on behalf of the citizens of London, and said: As far as I know, the Chinese learned to make the earliest means of transportation in the world three thousand years ago. Therefore, it is of great significance to welcome the ancient culture of China from wireless phones today. However, the reconstruction of international trade between the two countries is even more necessary. I believe that after this formal call, the common interests between the two countries will definitely increase day by day. After Smith finished speaking, the voice of Zheng Tianxi, our ambassador to the United Kingdom, was transmitted in the loudspeaker.

<h3>Thirty-Six Gold Francs for a Three-Minute Call</h3>

After the signing of the peace treaty with Japan, the China-Japan Line will also be opened. The engineer explained the international telecommunications charges, which are based on gold francs in accordance with the International Telecommunications Convention (the United States is not a signatory country, so China-US telephone calls are converted into US dollars). The temporary rate is 48,500 yuan per gold franc. The current charge is 36 francs every three minutes, which is equivalent to 1,746,000 yuan. This is a temporary rate and will be adjusted at any time in the future. It is also said that wireless phones are equipped with confidentiality equipment, and ordinary radios cannot receive them, so there is no way to leak secrets.</p>

<h3>Scenery of Mount Jishi - Majestic Peaks Beyond Imagination</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] Zhuang Xueben, consultant of the Xikang Provincial Government and manager of the Shanghai branch of the Kangzang Trade Company, is presenting photographs he took more than a decade ago during his travels in Kangzang. This is to introduce the actual situation of Mount Jishi to people in Shanghai before the upcoming departure of the Sino-American Mount Jishi Survey Team. More than 130 photos will be publicly exhibited at the French Literature Society on Nanchang Road on the 6th and 7th of this month. A preview will be held today for invited guests. The exhibited photographs, in addition to the scenery of the Mount Jishi area and the lives of tribal peoples, also include Muli Gonga, taken by the author from 1935 to 1938, and numerous photographs of famous mountains and rivers from east longitude 96 degrees to 103 degrees and north latitude 29 degrees to 36 degrees, which are extremely valuable. Mr. Zhuang, a native of Shanghai, was very interested in ethnology at an early age. In 1934, he planned to travel to Tibet alone, but failed. In Chengdu, he heard that the people of Oros (the southern area of Mount Jishi) were barbaric and had not yet emerged from primitive life, so he decided to go there. Passing through the Qiangxi and Zhukeji areas, the journey was exceptionally difficult and sparsely populated. He walked during the day and stayed in forests and valleys at night. Moreover, the climate was unpredictable, and the rapids were turbulent everywhere. He suffered greatly from the hardships of travel, hunger, and cold. Fortunately, he was cared for by chieftains along the way, and he reached Mosang. At that time, the local residents were at war with the Gansu side, and the residents asked Zhuang to mediate. After the end of the war, the tribal chief expressed his gratitude by ordering his son to become sworn brothers with Zhuang, and sent escorts to take him directly to the south bank of the Yellow River, i.e., the southern foot of the Bayan Har Mountain, before returning to Songpan. The journey lasted a total of nine months. According to Zhuang Xueben, the main peak of Mount Jishi, Amne Machin, is extremely magnificent, with continuous peaks and breathtaking scenery, which is beyond the imagination of people in the Jiangnan region. The average altitude of the plains in the area is over 4,000 meters, and it is home to 48 to 52 tribes.</p>

<h3>Shandong Women's Legislator Election - An Interlude in the Mandarin Duck Score - "Original Wife" Accuses Husband of Bigamy - Son Denies Mother is Alive</h3>
<p>[Jin'an, 1st Dispatch] The results of the Shandong Provincial Legislative Council election have not yet been officially announced by the provincial election office as of the time of this reporter's writing. However, the disputes caused by the election are already varied and endless. What is being discussed here is the question of the "original wife" of Education Director Li Taihua after Mrs. Chen Jiujing, the wife of the current Education Director of Shandong Province, participated in the Shandong women's group legislative election as a social figure. This has been unanimously recognized in Jinan as the most tortuous and complicated election dispute, and the question of whether an education director is guilty of "bigamy" has naturally become the most important social news.</p>
<p>Repeatedly Claims - My Husband</p>
<p>The course of events began on February 24th, when the Nanjing Jiuguo Daily published a piece by "Li Yangshi" entitled "Shandong Education Director Commits Bigamy". The original text is as follows: "My husband, his surname is Li and his name is Taihua, is currently the Education Director of the Shandong Provincial Government. I followed my husband through hardship and turmoil for eight years during the war. In the spring of 1942, my husband Li Taihua had a change of heart and cohabitated with a woman named Chen Jiujing. From then on, my husband's attitude, and everything about him, changed. After the victory, when Chairman He became the chairman of Shandong, Li Taihua was appointed as the education director. My husband was afraid that people in society would look at him with suggestive eyes, so he secretly married in Tianjin last year. My husband has threatened me many times, telling me not to publicize it. I have endured the pain and lived with my mother-in-law in a relative's house, living in a broken room. Now my mother-in-law is sick, and he has not visited his own mother once, and there is no money for medical treatment, so we can only rely on friends for help. My husband lives every day in his mistress Chen Jiujing's residence, which is a Western-style house in Qilu University, and is served by many people such as servants and housekeepers. He does not care about his own mother, let alone his original wife. This time, my husband has also allowed his mistress to run for some kind of legislator. My husband uses his power to get the counties to support his mistress Chen Jiujing. My husband uses his personal influence to force the county magistrates to guarantee a certain number of votes. I really can't stand what my husband is doing, I have endured it to the end. I appeal to the public to let the whole country know, Li Yangshi bows."</p>
<p>Urgent Announcement - Declaring Divorce</p>
<p>Next, Director Li and his son Zhishao posted the following announcement in the Shandong New News, the official newspaper of the Shandong Provincial Government, starting on the 29th:</p>
<p>Li Taihua's Urgent Announcement</p>
<p>Having read the report in the Nanjing Jiuguo Daily of February 24th entitled "Shandong Education Director Commits Bigamy", I am extremely surprised. It has been investigated that I and my original wife, Yangshi, had incompatible feelings, and in the summer of 1929, after negotiation by both relatives and friends Yang Liangpu and Han Tianzhen (both of whom are currently in Jinan), we agreed to divorce. All of the family property was owned by Yangshi, and the son, Li Zhishao, was fully responsible for raising and educating him. Yangshi died of tiger plague in the autumn of 1943. Now someone is borrowing a name and fabricating facts. Its intention is to disrupt my wife Chen Jiujing's participation in the legislative election. It is not only defiling my name. In addition to correcting the newspaper, I hereby solemnly declare this in order to correct public perception.</p>
<p>Li Zhishao's Urgent Announcement</p>
<p>Having read the news in the Nanjing Jiuguo Daily of February 24th entitled "Shandong Education Director Commits Bigamy", I am extremely surprised. After investigation, my father, Li Taihua, and my late mother, Yangshi, divorced in the summer of 1929 after negotiation between both relatives and friends. My late mother died of tiger plague in the autumn of 1943. All of the newspaper's claims are fabricated by others under false pretenses and concern my father's and stepmother's reputation. I hereby declare this in order to correct public perception.</p>
<p>Senator Lü Expresses Surprise</p>
<p>After these two announcements were published, the next day, all the newspapers here published a piece of news sent by Ms. Lü Yunzhang, Deputy Director of the Central Women's Movement Committee and Senator of the National Political Council. The content is as follows: "Female Senator Lü Yunzhang was deeply surprised to read two announcements in the Shandong New News of February 29th by Education Director Li Taihua and his son Li Zhishao, saying that Director Li's wife, Li Yangshi, had passed away long ago. The reason is that Yunzhang went to Dr. Lü's place at No. 445, Weiliu Road, Jing'er Road on February 16th for medical treatment because of illness. During a casual conversation, Dr. Lü unintentionally said that Li Taihua's mother, Li Liushi, and his wife, Li Yangshi, both live downstairs in this hospital and are living a very difficult life as the mother and wife of a company commander. His mother is sick and has no money for treatment, and Dr. Lü is providing pure voluntary assistance, etc. This proves that Director Li's original wife, Li Yangshi, is indeed still alive. A director who bears the important responsibility of education has such unfilial and unjust behavior, and Chairman Wang, who is known for his filial piety, should deal with this." Whether Director Li's original wife is still alive? Whether Director Li formally divorced his original wife? Due to a letter from Senator Lü, many people felt lost, and the development of future facts remains to be proven. However, one point can be added: according to reliable estimates from all sides, Mrs. Li, Chen Jiujing, is participating in the Shandong women's group legislative election. Although the provincial election office has not yet announced the results, everyone seems to believe that Mrs. Chen's election is no problem. The problem is that after Mrs. Chen is elected as a legislator as a social figure, although the number of votes for the candidates from the People's, Youth, and other parties is small, the central government has long stipulated that they should not be allowed to concede. On the other hand, among the Kuomintang candidates Lü Yunzhang, Wang Junying, and Bao Lin, one person must "give way".</p>
<h3>Shandong Education Director Li Taihua - The Mystery of the Original Wife</h3>
<p>[Jinan, 4th Dispatch] Regarding the mystery of Education Director Li Taihua's bigamy, after the Shandong New News published that Li Yangshi, who lives at No. 445 Jing'er Weiliu Road, is the widow of Li Weiheng of Qiuxian, and not Li Taihua's original wife, the Dahua Daily here published on the 4th the talk of Senator Lü Yunzhang, saying that "Li Yangshi is indeed Li Taihua's original wife, and if he denies it, he can come in person to confront her, and the truth will be revealed." The reporter of the newspaper then visited Li Yangshi and Li's mother, Li Liushi, (according to people in the same hospital, Li Yangshi and Li Liushi have been taken away by someone who looked like a public official, and their whereabouts are unknown.) In this way, the Li Taihua case of bigamy, which has attracted much attention, may not be able to reveal its mystery in the short term. [Another Dispatch] There is a new development in the "mystery of bigamy" of Shandong Education Director Li Taihua, which caused a sensation in Jinan. Previously, female Senator Lü Yunzhang pointed out that Li Yangshi, who lived at No. 445 Jing'er Weiliu Road, was Li Taihua's original wife, but according to a report in the Shandong New News, the official newspaper of the provincial government, on the 3rd, the newspaper interviewed Mr. Liu Pingxuan, who said: "Li Yangshi is indeed someone, that is, my cousin-in-law. As for being the original wife of Director Li, this is simply an insult to our family. My cousin Li Weiheng has already passed away, how could my cousin-in-law have a husband again?" However, the newspaper said in its conclusion: "What the truth is remains to be proven by future facts." Therefore, it is as the newspaper's headline says, "Who is randomly pointing the Mandarin Duck score, the mystery is confusing and detailed guesses are required." It is reported that Li Taihua's current wife is Mrs. Chen Jiujing, from Sichuan, a student who studied in the United States, and has only been married to Li for more than a year. This time, she participated in the Lu women's legislative election as a social figure at the persuasion of her husband. According to reports, she received a lot of votes. Therefore, it is widely rumored here that this Li Taihua incident was caused by his wife's involvement in the legislative election.</p>
<h3>Judgment on the Lanzhou Student-Military Police Conflict - Chief Culprit, Military Police Sentenced to Three Years in Prison - Medical Expenses Borne by the Military Police Regiment</h3>
<p>[Lanzhou, 4th Dispatch] The Lanzhou student-military police conflict has been resolved thanks to appropriate handling by the authorities in recent days. After the Xingyuan Military Law Office held an investigation hearing on February 27, detailed results were obtained, and the verdict was announced on the 3rd. More than a dozen teachers and students from Lanzhou University attended the hearing.

<p>Another dispatch: On February 29th, at around 5 am, six people were found posting slogans on Lizhi Road in Lanzhou, and a teenager was arrested. This reporter was able to see the slogan yesterday, which was two feet long and three inches wide, written on white earth paper with a brush, and clearly written by one person. It contained absurd sentences such as "We want to support the February 25th tragedy", "Support the New Democratic Government", and "Protect People's Freedom". The Lanzhou University February 25th Tragedy Support Association firmly denies that it issued the slogan.</p>

<h3>Murder for Money, Arson to Eliminate Traces: Zhengzhou Agricultural Bank Teller Sun Zhixiang's Heinous Act; Deceased Guo Lingyu Suffered More Than Thirty Knife Wounds</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Zhengzhou by Our Newspaper, 27th] On the 26th in Zhengzhou, a shocking case of murder for money and arson to eliminate traces occurred, causing a city-wide sensation. The victim, Guo Lingyu, 25 years old, from Sichuan, was the wife of Captain Fu Yuan of the Artillery Battalion of the 94th Brigade of the Fifth Army. The perpetrator was Sun Zhixiang, 25 years old, from Luoyang, a teller at the local Agricultural Bank. The case was solved within hours, and the circumstances were quite tortuous. At around 1 PM, a fire broke out at Zhengyi Flower Shop at No. 13 Liu Wanshun Street. At the time, the wind was strong and the fire was fierce, a truly terrifying scene. Fortunately, it was discovered early, and the fire brigade's rescue efforts were effective, preventing a major disaster. A woman and a sixteen-month-old girl were rescued from the scene. Unexpectedly, while clearing the scene, it was suddenly discovered that the rescued woman had her nose cut off, her right eyeball was protruding from its socket, her left eye was also sealed shut with thick blood, her face was unrecognizable, her throat had two knife wounds, each about an inch deep, her left hand had two fingers severed, and her right hand had five wounds, totaling more than twenty knife wounds. Her entire body was covered in blood, a gruesome sight. After receiving the report, Hong Minggao, the captain of the city's criminal investigation team, questioned Zhou Zhaoping, a female guest living with the victim, and her younger uncle, Sun Zhixiang, but obtained no leads. Subsequently, he took the two back to the station for further questioning. According to Zhou's statement, she was 19 years old, from Sichuan, and had married Sun Zhinian, the adjutant of the Advance Detachment of the 96th Brigade of the New Fifth Army, three years ago. Because her husband was deployed to the front lines, she lived with Guo Lingyu, the wife of her husband's colleague Zhang Suifu, and they had a good relationship. Her uncle, Sun Zhixiang, who worked at the Agricultural Bank in Hubei, would occasionally visit. In the morning, she went to see Sun Zhixiang about something, and then went to visit a Mrs. Liu at her home. When Deputy Adjutant Xiong of the Fifth Army came running, she learned that Guo had been killed and rushed back. When questioned, Sun simply shook his head and said he didn't know. Later, bloodstains were found on the corner of his blue cloth cotton-padded jacket and on the cuffs, and a long hair with bloodstains was found on the back of his cotton robe. Sun then confessed: The deceased, Guo Lingyu, had two taels of gold, a gold necklace, a gold bracelet, and a gemstone ring. Some time ago, she sold the gold necklace (weighing nine fen) and gave Sun 10 million yuan, entrusting him to deposit it in the bank to earn interest, but he had spent it all. Moreover, he had lost 20 million yuan gambling during the Spring Festival and could not repay it. His sister-in-law went to the bank to ask him for money twice on the 26th. Driven to desperation, he went to Guo's place and killed her, taking the two-plus taels of gold jewelry and setting a fire to cover up the traces.</p>
<h3>Xun Huisheng Flies to Beiping; Indicates Imminent Retirement from Stage Career</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Xi'an by Our Newspaper, 4th] Famous opera singer Xun Huisheng has quietly flown to Beiping after performing here for over four months.

Xun also stated orally that he is getting old and no longer suitable for a stage career. Upon returning to Beiping, he will focus on business affairs.</p>
<h3>Husband Joins the Army, Wife Violated: Xu Lianyuan Suffers Misfortune</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Wuxi by Our Newspaper, 2nd] Xu Lianyuan, a resident of the Seventh Household of the Seventh Jia of the Thirteenth Bao in Dongting Dongshan Township, Suzhou, is 22 years old. He comes from a poor family and makes a living by selling fruit. He married a local woman named Lu, and their relationship was very affectionate after the marriage. However, Lianyuan is a natural gambler. During the recent New Year, he lost repeatedly, resulting in a large deficit. Knowing that he could not make up for it, he heard that various townships and towns in this county needed to recruit volunteers. So, he asked his friend Gu Hongsheng to introduce him to Xin'an Town in the southern part of the county to serve as a volunteer, stating that the settlement fee was 44 million yuan. Xu Jinbao and Sun Ada, who specialized in selling conscripts, handled the matter and signed an agreement. Unexpectedly, Sun and Xu were both unemployed vagrants. After receiving the money, they only gave 14 million yuan to Lianyuan for his expenses, pocketing the rest. After being sent to the Wuxi Regiment Management District Headquarters in Huishan, Lianyuan was assigned to the Fourth Company of the new recruits for service. Because he was not accustomed to military life and thought about the pain of leaving his home and wife, he felt quite regretful. Therefore, he discussed it with the original introducer, Xu Jinbao, and offered to return all of the settlement fee and buy a substitute. After both parties agreed, they proceeded with the exchange, but it was unsuccessful due to physical incompatibility. Unable to do anything, Lianyuan escaped without a trace while being transferred to Shanghai for training. After the incident, the authorities immediately ordered a search. The introducer, Xu Jinbao, together with Zhang Honglie, the town chief of Xin'an Town, searched everywhere. On the 20th of last month, they used deceptive tactics on Lianyuan's wife, Lu, saying: Your husband is doing very well in the Regiment Management District, he has been winning big in gambling these days, and he has three gold rings that he urgently wants to give to you for household expenses. If you delay, you may not be able to see him, etc. Lu believed it to be true and followed them to the town. At the time, Jinbao immediately imprisoned her at the New Asia Hotel on Gongyuan Road. Around 11 PM that night, Jinbao brought a strange man named Xiao Tang to the bedroom, claiming he was mediating, and forced Lu to talk in detail at the nearby Gongyuan Hotel. Xiao Tang also used threats to rape Lu. From then on, she was continuously raped by the introducers, and Xu's mistress forcibly took Lu's earrings in the name of compensating for losses. At the same time, they forced Lu to take photos and sign a written guarantee to compensate the Xin'an Town Office for a loss of 2 million yuan. At the end of last month, Xu Lianyuan, who had escaped, was found by Town Chief Chen and sent to the county government's criminal investigation team for detention. The team notified Lu, and she was freed. Husband and wife met and poured out their hearts about their experiences since parting. Lianyuan was furious when he heard about his wife's deception and instructed Lu to report to the county government and ask for the arrest and punishment of Xu Jinbao and other conscription traffickers. At noon on the 2nd, Secretary Huang of the county government secretly dispatched two political police officers to the address. At No. 15 New Asia Hotel, they arrested Xu Jinbao and Xiao Tang (originally named Ruiquan) and seized a large number of criminal evidence such as ropes and conscription certificates, bringing them back to the county. The county government believes that these military service brokers have obviously engaged in threatening extortion and fraudulent behavior and should be severely punished to serve as a warning and eliminate harm to society.</p>

<h3>Jiangyin Huang Guicheng Case: Aftermath Still Awaiting Clarification; Police Headquarters Dispatches Personnel for Thorough Investigation</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Jiangyin, 3rd] On November 14th of last year, Huang Guicheng, a resident of Donglai Town, Changshu, was at the Dongwai bus station to deliver 200 million yuan in legal tender to the Yang Limin Yarn Factory on behalf of the Hesheng Yarn Shop in Zhuchang Lane, Wuxi. Huang, due to gambling losses, falsely claimed that 100 million yuan had been stolen. Former Police Chief Wei Huimin and the city defense department discovered the truth within twelve hours, and Huang Guicheng was sent to the court for trial. On the 17th, the original owner, Ji Zhesheng, went to the police station to collect the money. Former Chief Wei dispatched Judicial Section Chief Jiang Hua to meet with Ji to solicit 40 million yuan as a reward. Subsequently, Senators Han Guozhang and Zhu Zhenhao sent a letter to the county government stating that the money should be returned. Yang Ku merchants also filed a complaint with the province.

On February 4th, the county government received an order from the province approving the Police Headquarters of the Ministry of Interior to conduct a thorough investigation. The headquarters dispatched Inspector Mu Guoguang to Cheng the day before yesterday, going to the police station to review the files.

It was the slack season after the New Year, and people from the surrounding villages gathered to watch, creating a large crowd and a lively atmosphere. Some local riffraff set up a gambling table next to the opera stage, attracting gamblers and resulting in large winnings and losses.

<h3>Chao Lake Irrigation Area: Feather Production and Sales Remain Strong</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Huizhou, February 27th] Feathers have a wide range of uses, from bedding to decorations. China is a major producer of feathers, with Shanghai, Hankou, Kowloon, and Wuhu being the largest distribution centers. Although Wuhu's production of chicken and duck feathers is not as abundant as Shanghai's, its production of goose feathers is even greater. Farmers in the Chao Lake irrigation area have a special knack for goose farming, producing goose feathers that are thick and lustrous. Before the war, Wuhu's export of goose feathers occupied an important position in international trade. In 1928, the export of chicken feathers was 295 dan, valued at 44,000 taels of silver; duck feathers were 9 dan, valued at 207,000 taels of silver; and goose feathers were 6,113 dan, valued at 228,000 taels of silver. Later, feather merchants, seeking profit, mixed in dregs and powder, lowering the quality and credit, leading to a gradual decline in exports. During the Anti-Japanese War, the Japanese paid close attention to feathers and rapeseed as they collected materials in Wuhu. In the past two years, feather production in the Chao Lake irrigation area and the Qingyi River area has remained abundant. Farmers are even more interested in raising poultry than before. Because the prices of chickens, ducks, geese, and eggs have risen, they have all listed poultry, eggs, and feathers as supplementary income to support their families. Currently, the market prices of poultry and eggs in the production area are very high. Chickens, ducks, and geese generally sell for 30,000 to 40,000 yuan per jin, and eggs sell for 2,500 to 3,000 yuan per egg. Because feathers are light in weight, it takes the feathers of dozens of geese to make a jin of goose feathers, and twice as many chickens or ducks. Last winter, the feather sales season was strong, and transactions suddenly became brisk. Sales to England also gradually increased. Special-grade chicken and duck feathers rose to 1.8 million yuan per hundred jin, and special-grade goose feathers rose to 2.6 million yuan per hundred. The export prospects of feathers in Wuhu are showing a new opportunity for improvement. (Reporter Ning Po)</p>

<h3>Tangqi in Spring, the Fruit Village North of Hangzhou: One Plum Every Five Steps, Fragrance Ten Miles Away</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Hangzhou, 3rd] Tangqi, located sixty li from Hangzhou, is the fruit kingdom of Zhejiang, famous for its cherries, loquats, plums, apricots, peaches, sugarcane, and other produce. Due to the large-scale planting of fruit trees, the spring blossoms are particularly abundant, especially the blooming of plum blossoms, which is a spectacular sight. The so-called thirty li "Fragrant Snow Sea" of Tangqi, with one plum tree every five steps and fragrance ten miles away, has captivated many poets and literati, and intoxicated countless flower lovers! This year, I happened to arrive during the peak season of the flowers, so even though the weather was gloomy, many tourists still came from afar to welcome the spring with joyful hearts. After enduring the long winter, even a gloomy spring is lovely. The car drove directly to the hilly area of ​​Chaoshan, where we were greeted by a group of innocent and rustic children, who were all small guides, smiling because they could earn money. According to them, each person can earn three to five thousand yuan a day. In the mountain village, this is not a small income. In fact, the scenery of Chaoshan is very simple, and you can find it yourself without a guide. As soon as you get out of the car, the fragrance comes with the breeze, and in front of you is a sea of ​​fragrant snow—to be precise, it should be a "Fragrant Snow Lake." The national beauty and clear fragrance are revealed before your eyes, and you will naturally follow the fragrance. In this charming "Fragrant Snow Lake," the Song Plum Pavilion stands solemnly, like an island, like a lake reef. Standing in the Song Plum Pavilion, you can not only look around and carefully admire the flowers, but also see the ancient Song Plum, vigorous and powerful, in front of the pavilion. It has survived many vicissitudes and is still growing strong. Although there is now artificial protection, it still thrives and blossoms, not inferior to its younger peers. This spirit is precisely the founding spirit of the Chinese nation. Seeing the Song Plum, I love our national flower even more. From the Song Plum Pavilion, you reach Bao Ci Temple, a place for tourists to rest and one of the famous scenic spots of Chaoshan. There is a Guanyin Hall in the temple, very small and simple, but it preserves precious antiques: a stone carving of Guanyin statue painted by Wu Daozi, a great painter of the Tang Dynasty, with the famous couplet titled by Yu Quyuan hanging on the left and right: "Buddha stone does not grind Tang ink, immortal plum still occupies Song years." In front of the hall, there is an ancient Tang plum tree, vigorous and full of life, seemingly younger than the Song plum, so many people say it is fake. In addition to the Tang plum, there are also lush cypress trees, blooming winter sweet, and a rare and beautiful green, vine-clustered plum, refreshing and unforgettable. Mr. Huang Yanpei also came to Chaoshan to watch the plum blossoms a few days ago and wrote a poem for the monks of the temple: "I once saw the ancient Tang plum in Santai, and only came to Chaoshan after knowing it for a long time; the clear sky is about to dazzle a piece of snow, the single trunk is old and the flowers are still blooming. This mountain is suitable for plums, especially the people in the mountains are spared from freezing; one or two have survived for eight or nine hundred years, making tourists think of Zhao Song. The Tang Plum and Song Plum are rare, and the six petals are not in the shape, this flower is ancient and full of mulberry sea, and now the sound of gold is noisy outside the mountain."</p>
<p>To the left of Bao Ci Temple is the tomb of the famous painter Wu Changshuo, with a stone statue of Wu next to the tomb, and a stele in front of it engraved with "Portrait of Wu Changshuo teaching arts," simple and elegant. Going up the mountain from Bao Ci Temple, there are two more temples, located on the top of the mountain, with a beautiful environment, but there are no more flowers. Along the way, however, there are three or two clumps here and there, with clear fragrance overflowing everywhere. Going seven or eight li from Chaoshan, there is the Long Cave. At this point, looking out from above, the so-called thirty-li sea of ​​fragrant snow is presented before you. As the breeze rises, the fragrance surges, indeed with the magnificence and vastness of the sea. Being in it, you directly suspect that you are in heaven and do not want to return to the "paradise" on earth——Hangzhou. Tourists love flowers, but mountain farmers love fruit; people who live in nature all day long do not value the beauty of nature but only value the products of nature and utilize its functions. They are only happy when the fruit trees bloom and bear fruit. Bringing hundreds or thousands of dan of fruit from the waterway to other villages brings back the wealth of Tangqi. Tangqi was indeed a prosperous and happy water village before the war, but the suffering war exhausted the wealth of Tangqi. Today, the houses in Tangqi Town are still so crowded, and people travel by boat, and it is not necessary to bring umbrellas and wear raincoats when going to the street on rainy days; but this is only the appearance. The emptiness and suffering inside cannot be seen for a while, but there is one thing that can be seen clearly: before the war, there were five edge factories in Tangqi, and now only Chongyu remains; even this one relies on loans from the Agricultural Bank of China to maintain itself, and the output for export has greatly declined. As for the domestically sold fruits, one of the famous products, the loquat, will have a much smaller harvest this year due to the impact of the weather, and the farmers are suffering for this. What about the merchants? They also have their troubles, the most pressing of which is the housing problem. Shi Ziwen, the person in charge of the Chamber of Commerce, told the reporter that most of the four hundred shops in Tangqi are rented, and there are only five or six landlords. These landlords are very ruthless, charging three dan of white rice per month for the rent of each shop, and five or six dan per month for two shops. If they do not pay as required, they will "take it back for their own use." Taking advantage of the housing shortage, the landlords want to exploit the merchants, so they formed a joint chamber of commerce to deal with the landlords together, in order to obtain reasonable living conditions. This matter, like thousands of housing disputes, is closely tied to the hearts of millions of people. They hope that the government should uphold justice for the majority of tenants in this regard. The blooming plum blossoms first brought the news of spring, and the spring in Tangqi—this fruit village—is very enviable; but the people in Tangqi not only hope that the plum blossoms bring spring, but they also hope that spring will bring the wealth of Tangqi—a bumper harvest of fruit and reasonable living conditions, in order to restore their vitality. They sent away the winter with smiles, and now they welcome the spring with the same smiles. (This newspaper reporter Huang Xingtian)</p>

<h3>Ode to Mahatma Gandhi; Continued from the Second Paragraph of the Previous Article</h3>
<p>Eighth Chapter: Holy</p>
<p>Ninth Chapter: Dedication to All Sentient Beings</p>
<p>Heaven creates earth. Each inch of land produces everything for the present.</p>
<p>Mahatma sacrifices his life to save the world, without anger or resentment.</p>
<p>He gives to the poor and ultimately reaches the other shore.</p>
<p>He fearlessly bestows virtue, his body enduring strength, his spirit shining.</p>
<p>With meditation and wisdom, he emits light. His body is gone, but his path should be followed greatly.</p>
<p>His clear virtue will return to the most good heaven.</p>
<p>I wish to dedicate this light and dispel the darkness, illuminating all directions.</p>
<p>In the middle of the lunar month of the year of the Republic of China, I, an admirer of Mahatma Gandhi, earnestly prayed for the unity of the Indian people.</p>
<p>To achieve a pure city, his prayers and efforts are countless and rapid.</p>
<p>Nehru and other students prayed in place of me.</p>
<p>I beg the Mahatma for compassion for all.</p>
<p>In the middle of the night, he was suddenly murdered, ending his life.</p>
<p>Alas! Mankind is crazy and loses its true nature.</p>
<p>I feel the deep pain. My knowledge of ancient and modern India is at least related to Buddhism.</p>
<p>Using the scriptures and words of both as a metaphor,</p>
<p>Once the defilements are broken, the Buddha-nature flows.</p>
<p>The soldiers repent for harming the Buddha.</p>
<p>This causes the six senses to reflect and harmonize.</p>
<p>Because of his faith and dedication, his life is not insignificant.</p>
<p>His strength will move others to eternity.</p>
<p>One mind is born from one body, awakening one's intellect and wisdom.</p>
<p>Now his good deeds can be changed and corrected.</p>
<p>It is the knowledge of good that is innate.</p>
<p>He will not stop unless his actions are the same.</p>
<p>He will not destroy his virtue with ignorance, his power to illuminate virtue and reform the people.</p>
<p>And looking at the past ten years, the madness of Germany and Italy has its root in greed.</p>
<p>The fire of ignorance destroyed human civilization.</p>
<p>The result is the creation of a unique example of virtue.</p>
<p>In ancient and modern times, without exceptions, only those with virtue can subdue desire.</p>
<p>The evil consequences of harming others will never be spared.</p>
<p>Turning back is the path; serving people is the difference.</p>
<p>Reverence and dedication to religion, if there is no love, there is no faith or action.</p>
<p>Those who do not know and do not believe in the words of the saints.</p>
<p>Give your hands to the country.</p>
<p>The final words and entrustment are the same as the intent of not stealing from the people.</p>
<p>If people can strive to emulate it in reforming their minds and education, they will surely be able to develop the great qualities of diligence, thrift, patience, and a lifestyle that uses modern machines without being tempted or enslaved by them.</p>

<h3>Ministry of Education Spokesperson Announces Three Stages of Registration for Private Schools; Application for Registration Permitted One Year After Approval to Open</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 4th] A spokesperson for the Ministry of Education stated: Since the post-war recovery, many people in various regions have been preparing to establish private schools. However, many have not followed the prescribed procedures for registration and have already begun enrolling students, which has led to issues with academic records. The registration process is divided into three stages: (1) Possessing school buildings, sufficient funds, and start-up expenses, etc., first establish a board of directors and report to the local educational administrative agency, which will then forward the report to the higher-level educational administrative agency for review and approval. (2) After the board of directors is registered, then submit an application to open the school. Enrollment can only begin after approval. (3) Only after the school has been open for one year can an application for registration be submitted. Only after registration is approved can it be considered a formal school. This caution is intended to prevent the misuse of names to establish schools indiscriminately, which would mislead young people. It is hoped that all regions can operate schools in accordance with the regulations. Before approval to open a school is granted, do not enroll students without authorization, to avoid difficulties.</p>

<h3>United University's First Shot; Battle Against Marines Tonight; Starting at 8:30 PM at the Municipal Gymnasium</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] The Qingdao US Navy Marines team, who have come to Shanghai on an expedition, have already fought three matches. Although they have lost all three matches, their strength should not be underestimated. Moreover, each match has been more exciting than the last. Tonight's final battle, against the United Team, which is a joint force of the two giants of the city's basketball scene, Hualian and Dagong, will be even more exciting.

<p>Cooperation Between Two Strong Teams; A Wonderful Thing for Basketball</p>

Players like Li Zhenzhong, Cai Lianke, Cai Wenhua, Wu Chengzhang, Bao Songyuan, Cai Wenzhang, Chen Xuechong, Tu Wenlong, Ren Xiangcheng, and Cai Zhongqiang are all known for their superb individual skills. Hualian and Dagong each have their own strengths. This time's mixture is truly what is called "two difficulties combined, two beauties possessed." It is no less than the representative team for the city in the upcoming National Games. The cooperation of the two basketball giants is a rare event. Tonight's goal is to use the match against the Marines as the first shot of the expedition, which is indeed an excellent object for testing strength and connection.

<h3>Shortage of Chips in the Market, Competing Advances by Merchant Groups, Cotton Yarn and Cloth Continue to Rise Sharply, 42-count Blue Phoenix Fine Yarn Rises Another 5 Million</h3>
<p>Yesterday's cotton yarn market, due to the limited allocation of yarn by the Spinning and Construction Company on the previous day, the chips were insufficient to meet demand. Merchant groups from Tianjin, Guangdong, and other regions remained keen on buying. 42-count Blue Phoenix fine yarn, replicating manufacturers took advantage of the low prices to absorb it, still strong, the price soared to 130 million yuan. By the close of the market, it returned to 127 million yuan, a further increase of 5 million yuan compared to the previous day. Jincheng and Shuiyue also rose by about 6 million yuan. Only Blue Phoenix in 40-count yarn rose by 5 million, while others remained stable. The prices of 32-count yarn were mixed.</p>
<p>21-count Double Horse yarn, the Guangdong merchants' shipping costs are about to be adjusted, and due to shipping schedules, the absorption power is very strong. They bought as soon as there was a sale, and the price soared to a new high of 78.5 million yuan, then rose another 4 million yuan, and the warehouse receipts also showed an increase of about 4 million yuan. 16-count coarse yarn was sluggish due to slow sales, and the market showed oversupply, with prices generally falling by 800,000 to 2 million yuan.</p>
<p>In the cotton cloth market, due to the soaring prices of cotton yarn, and the cost of shipping and handling for merchants increased more than double, although the market was in reverse with the inland, merchants from the north and Guangdong-Hankou all adhered to the principle of holding goods and rushed to export. Cloth merchants on this street, due to the lack of chips, also competed to buy. The price of Longtou fine cloth has been raised all the way to 2.8 million yuan. Subsequently, retail investors who made profits took the opportunity to sell, and the price returned to 2.77 million yuan, a further increase of 70,000 yuan compared to the previous day. Other fine cloths also rose by 50,000 to 100,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Sijunzi serge was in high demand from all parties, soaring to 2.69 million yuan, but after the China Textile Company opened for sale, the price immediately fell back, closing at 2.65 million yuan, resulting in the same increase of 80,000 yuan as Jinlian Miaowu. In addition, Zhigong bleached cloth, fine twill, and plain cloth, high-end Shilin cloth, etc., all remained strong.</p>
<p>Spinning and Construction Sells Yarn</p>

<h3>Importers and Exporters Association Holds Emergency Meeting to Discuss Customs Penalties and Arrival Issues</h3>
<p>[Reported by This Newspaper] It is reported that recently, the Jianghai Customs has issued hundreds of penalty notices, based on Announcement No. 187 of the Jianghai Customs, imposing penalties for goods that have arrived in Shanghai but have not been declared, declaring them confiscated. It is heard that this penalty is quite different from the original announcement. The Importers and Exporters Association of this city has repeatedly received reports from its members, and held a temporary emergency meeting the night before last. The meeting was attended by Shou Jingwei, Zhang Yaozhang, Hua Hongtao, Chen Maoxun, Pu Liangchou, Li Huaqing, Ma Zhongda, and others, who studied the matter in detail by points. It was considered that this penalty by the Jianghai Customs was probably due to the failure to review the laws and regulations, and the inability of various departments to communicate with each other. It was unanimously resolved to send representatives to argue with the Customs reasonably and request the prompt revocation of this illegal penalty.</p>
<h3>Restrict Speculative Factories, New Factories Should Be Temporarily Suspended</h3>
<p>In order to restrict the establishment of speculative factories, the Industry and Commerce Guidance Office has drafted audit measures and submitted them to the Ministry of Economic Affairs for review. It is learned that the office has received instructions, which are as follows: (1) It is indeed necessary to restrict speculative factories. The proposed three requirements for new factory applications (a. Equipment with the latest machinery, b. Coordination with new technical training, c. Production of high-quality finished products related to national defense and people's livelihood) are feasible. However, existing factories should also be subject to these requirements, and the establishment of new factories should be temporarily suspended.</p>
<p>(2) In the future, when factories apply for redistribution, they should be ordered to submit authentic documents of the finished products made from the obtained raw materials for review.</p>
<p>(3) Quota allocation was originally a temporary measure adopted due to insufficient foreign exchange. Since the government has such measures, it should continue to effectively control the prices of finished products so that the selling prices of finished products with low raw material prices are not too high, and the price difference between raw materials and finished products is avoided. In this way, the flow of raw materials into the black market can be eradicated from the root. Appropriate measures should be drafted and submitted for review.</p>
<h3>Artificial Silk Recovers, Silk Goods Continue to Rise</h3>
<p>The artificial silk market first weakened and then rose yesterday, finally rising by 4 million yuan compared to the previous day. 120-count Xu-character and Jin Sanma bright silk opened at 44 million yuan in the morning, but due to the high price of factory silk, confidence gradually increased, and the market closed at 50 million yuan at noon. The maximum price in the afternoon was 2 million yuan, and the market closed at 1 million yuan.</p>
<p>Factory warp made further progress yesterday. Two orders for C-grade were transacted at a price of 80 million yuan. High less-than-truckload sold for 76.7 million yuan, and medium-grade less-than-truckload sold for 4.5 million yuan, with a total of more than ten packages traded. The quoted prices for other grades were all about 8 million yuan higher than the previous day. Special high-grade less-than-truckload warp had two loads transacted yesterday, with prices reaching as high as 50 million yuan.</p>
<p>The silk goods market continued to rise yesterday. Huaqiang real silk quilt covers reached a maximum price of 4 million yuan immediately, and the market closed at 2.4 million yuan, a large increase of 2.4 million yuan compared to the previous day. Dachang plaid crepe had a maximum price of 97,000 yuan, and the market closed at 94,000 yuan, an increase of 6,000 yuan compared to the previous day. Other goods also showed slight increases yesterday.</p>
<h3>Affected by Transportation Price Hikes, Rice Prices Also Rise</h3>
<p>The rice market opened strong yesterday morning, but the market slightly recovered later. Due to news that both road and water transportation will increase from today, the cost is increased, and due to the high tin prices the day before, merchants tried their best to raise prices. The prices in the morning market had increased by 150,000 yuan. However, household rice has begun to be sold, and sales on this street are quite sluggish, and the market turnover has also been affected. Moreover, there were more arrivals yesterday, with a total of 11,271 shi in the north and south markets, making it difficult to support, and the market immediately declined midway. The specially high-grade japonica rice in the North Market once shouted up to 3 million, and the market closed at 3 million. White japonica was 2.9 million. Bo rice in the South Market was 2.85 million, and in the North Market was 2.9 million, each up 100,000 yuan. Wuhu machine-milled xian was 2.65 million, and white yuan in the North Market reached 3 million.</p>
<p>Flour Continues to Rise</p>
<p>Flour prices rose due to the rise in rice prices, high prices in the inland, and the fact that factories opened less often. Lao Che flour opened at 1.34 million, and the later market was 1.33 million. Bingchuan opened at 1.33 million, and later was 1.32 million, each up 40,000 to 50,000 yuan. The transactions of Hongfeng and Jiancheng were relatively lively, probably because Hongfeng and Jiancheng had more ball transactions. The prices of both were also 40,000 to 50,000 yuan higher than the previous day. Bran was in a flat and weak state because the factory opened a lot on the previous day, and wheat remained at 1.85 million.</p>
<p>Coarse Grains Hover</p>
<p>There were no large fluctuations in the prices of coarse grains. The selling and buying parties in the morning opening of soybeans were reluctant to give in. One wanted to rise and sell, and the other wanted to lower and buy. As a result, the price was similar to the previous day. Hankou Zha soybeans were 1.5 million to 1.55 million, and 1.45 million. Green beans and corn slightly rose by 50,000 yuan, and red sorghum was slightly higher by 50,000 yuan. Sesame and white sesame sales were sluggish. Hankou white sesame opened at 3.08 million, down slightly by 20,000 yuan, while milk sesame and yellow sesame rose by 50,000 to 70,000 yuan. Yuan sesame has been suppressed for a long time. Yesterday, the market jumped sharply by 300,000 to 400,000 yuan. Jian Qing rose by 100,000 yuan, and Xieqiao Jian Qing was 1.55 million yuan. There were advances by the Fujian gang, and raw kernels rose by 100,000 to 150,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Edible Oil Soars</p>
<p>Edible oil finally saw a price increase of 200,000 yuan. Soybean oil was actively traded. Dayou soybean oil opened at 6.08 million in the early market. Sales on this street were very good, and retail investors successively entered, gradually increasing, to a final price of 6.2 million yuan. Da You Xin and Da You Yu both closed at 6.2 million yuan. Rapeseed oil opened at 5.92 million in the initial market, and the final price of returning goods was as high as 6.04 million yuan. Qingdao Ji barrel raw oil opened at 7.12 million, and finally rose to 7.2 million yuan. Other Jiangbei and Chongqing raw oils were also made, each rising by about 200,000 yuan. Ji barrel small cart sesame oil was 6.9 million yuan, and soybean cake was in a flat state.</p>
<h3>Construction Materials Sell Well, Bricks, Tiles, Sand, and Gravel Soar</h3>
<p>Among the construction materials, the prices of bricks, tiles, sand, and gravel have soared due to the increase in the cost of living, the high labor costs in the production area, the development of sales in the spring season, the insufficient arrivals, and the thin inventory.</p>
<p>Qingzu bricks have risen to 45 million yuan per 10,000, a huge increase of 12 million compared to the beginning of the week. Qing bricks are priced at 30 million yuan, up 7 million. Yellow bricks are 22 million yuan, Qing tiles are 21 million yuan, machine-made red bricks are 60 million yuan, machine-made red tiles are 43 million yuan per thousand, and clay red tiles are 32 million yuan.</p>
<p>Yellow sand has also risen to 1 million yuan per ton, and gravel is 1.2 million yuan. The prices of various goods have soared from 10% to 30-40%. However, lime and cement are still stable, but the base price has also become firm.</p>
<h3>Exported Raw Materials Can Be Imported Independently, Export Management Committee Convenes Various Industries for Consultation</h3>
<p>In order to increase the export of goods and earn foreign exchange, the Export Management Committee has decided to allow manufacturers to import the raw materials needed for exported goods independently, and has formulated measures for the import of raw materials for exported manufactured goods, which have been approved and promulgated by the Executive Yuan. The committee considers that the imported raw materials needed by various industries are extremely numerous. In order to understand the actual situation needed by various industries, it has invited various industries to consult separately, starting on the 23rd of last month. The number of units invited reached as many as 32 industries, and meetings were held with representatives of one or two industries every day. During the meeting, the export volume of each industry, the quantity of raw materials needed from abroad, and the amount of foreign exchange that the manufactured goods can be exchanged for were all presented one by one. The committee will then review and handle the information based on the results of the consultation.</p>
<p>The industries that the committee has convened for consultation, as of the 4th, include shirts, undershirts, socks, bedsheets, towels, handkerchiefs, clothing, water bottles, enamel, steel, electrical appliances, bakelite, yarn tubes, wool weaving, silk weaving, wood yarn, rubber, raincoats, and other 18 industries. From today (5th), buttons, food, glass, seasoning powder, umbrellas, rattan and willow ware, cosmetics, pharmaceuticals, needles, canning, stone powder, silk scenery, mirrors, and other 14 industries will continue to hold meetings.</p>
<p>According to the person in charge of the committee, the import of these raw materials is outside the quota for the fourth and fifth quarters. Manufacturers of all exported manufactured goods can apply to import the raw materials they need, and the Central Bank will provide foreign exchange. Those whose total value of raw materials requested for import does not exceed 40% of the total export value of their manufactured goods can be approved first. If it exceeds 40%, they can apply on a case-by-case basis. This measure is also a trial of the chain system, but it is different from the general import and export chain. In the current period of foreign exchange shortage, the government is doing everything possible to increase the import of raw materials for various manufacturers, which is truly a painstaking effort. It is hoped that the manufacturers of various exporting industries will cooperate with the government.</p>
<h3>Taiwan Sugar Recovers</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the tenth phase of Taiwan Sugar's distribution was carried out as usual, with the same allocation price as before, but the package amount was based on the eighth phase, with 120 groups of special cotton white totaling 15,175 packages, and 180 groups of No. 2 sand white totaling 10,540 packages, a decrease compared to the ninth phase. The Taiwan dollar also increased by 3 yuan, to 145 yuan, so the market sentiment improved, and it recovered.</p>
<p>The association's distribution, spot 24 coarse white initially opened at 3.6 million yuan, then rose by 850,000 to 880,000 yuan. Four half-white from 3.85 million yuan to 4 million yuan. 20 medium sand white from 3.12 million yuan to 3.3 million yuan, up 200,000 to 300,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Warehouse receipt transactions fluctuated more. The eighth phase of medium sand white rose by 50,000 yuan, the ninth phase of coarse white rose by more than 100,000 yuan, and the tenth phase of medium sand white fluctuated by more than 200,000 yuan before and after. And four half-white initially opened at 880,000 yuan, then slightly softened, and finally recovered upward, reaching more than 1 million yuan.</p>
<p>Local sugar also stabilized, but the increase was limited. Shantou Qing was 2.4 million yuan to 2.37 million yuan, Mian Chi was 2.47 million yuan to 2.5 million yuan, Xing Chi was 2.44 million yuan to 2.4 million yuan, and the second grade was 2.28 million yuan. Diao Qing was 2.34 million yuan, and Shunde Qing was the same price, with a total of more than 1,000 packages opened.</p>
<h3>Taiwan Sugar Company Sells Sugar, Quota of Approximately 2,000 Tons</h3>
<p>[Reported by This Newspaper] The Taiwan Sugar Company sold sugar as usual yesterday, distributing approximately 2,000 tons based on the eighth phase of sugar distribution this year. Two types of sugar were distributed: one was special grade cotton white, with an allocation price of 2.65 million yuan, and the other was No. 2 sand white, with an allocation price of 2.4 million yuan.</p>
<h3>Flourishing Trading of Chinese Stocks, Yong Yarn Continues to Rise</h3>
<p>Chinese stocks experienced a period of transfer yesterday, and shifted their ground outside the market. Trading was exciting, and those in the industry still showed strong buying interest. Yong Yarn continued its upward trend, but miscellaneous stocks paled in comparison, and the strong momentum gradually weakened at the end.</p>
<p>The morning opening was slightly sluggish due to tight monetary conditions. Yong Yarn entered the market at prices of 1160 yuan and 1210 yuan. After opening, No. 179 and others immediately traded for immediate delivery, with Yong Yarn immediate delivery first seeing a low of 1158 yuan. However, No. 224 and others aggressively raised prices for deferred delivery, and No. 197 and others absorbed for immediate delivery, rising to 1177 yuan and 1243 yuan. No. 145 and others sold for immediate delivery, No. 117 and others sold for deferred delivery. The outside market interest rate opened high at 2.85 and 3.3, and those with margin accounts who were unable to secure goods were forced down to 1148 yuan and 1223 yuan. The premium for current advances continued to widen, but the major players in the industry remained firm in their intentions, continuously absorbing. External stocks were also stimulated, with No. 232 and others advancing, and No. 36 and others advancing on the Shanghai Stock Exchange. China Xing and China Silk hit the limit up. Yong Yarn rose to high prices of 1110 yuan and 1290 yuan, with No. 141 and others selling for deferred delivery, and No. 95 and others selling for immediate delivery, near noon dropping to within 1180 yuan and 1270 yuan. No. 224 and others strongly supported the price, and No. 226 and others absorbed for immediate delivery, with the noon closing at 1195 yuan and 1280 yuan. Compared to the previous close, immediate delivery stocks were among those hitting the limit up. After hitting the limit up, China Silk saw some retracement, surging by 10%. China Textile, Rongfeng, Business, and Yonggong rose by 5%, Hengfeng and Anshang remained flat, and the rest saw slight increases. Deferred delivery stocks, due to the premium, each rose by 10% to 15%.</p>
<p>In the afternoon, Yong Yarn started from 1210 yuan and 1290 yuan, with No. 65 and others selling for deferred delivery, and No. 35 and others selling for immediate delivery, retreating to 1195 yuan and 1275 yuan. No. 218 and others were still buying and there was demand, while No. 13 and others were selling for deferred delivery, and No. 157 and others were also selling for immediate delivery, falling to 1180 yuan and 1248 yuan. No. 13 and others were advancing on deferred delivery, and No. 160 and others were advancing on deferred delivery, with China Xing hitting the limit up and rising to new high prices of 1225 yuan and 1293 yuan. No. 103 and others were selling for immediate delivery, and No. 104 advanced and then sold. The National Bank made very few advances. Although there was a retracement, there was still demand. No. 183 and others sold for deferred delivery, and the closing price was 280 yuan and 1257 yuan. As a result of the after-hours balance count, China Xing immediate delivery shares remained at the limit, Hengfeng rose by 5%, China Textile, Tongyi, and Qinxing remained flat, underwear saw a slight increase, China-France Yonggong fell by 5%, and the rest saw slight declines. In the outside market, unlisted stocks in banks, culture, public utilities, and Dasheng rose again by 5% to 10%.</p>
<p>Arbitrage trading was very lively yesterday due to the change in direction outside the market, and premiums also rose in tandem. Interest rates for advance-settlement ranged from 2.3 to 2.78 fen per month. For on-board arbitrage, it could reach over 3 jiao. Regarding premium, Yong Yarn opened at 70 yuan, rising from 67 yuan to 80 yuan, with the noon close at 78 yuan. Xinhe ranged from 30 yuan to 32 yuan, and Meiya opened at the highest price of 180 yuan, falling to 160 yuan, with the closing price at 170 yuan. Small stocks were around 8 yuan.</p>
<h3>Stable Government Bonds, Rising Foreign Stocks</h3>
<p>Government bonds were very stable yesterday. Unified Grade C opened at 90,000 yuan, which was already a low price. Midway through, it rose to 96,000, and then leveled off slightly. Dachengxing and Rooms 550 and 503 bought in, while Rooms 360, 552, and 500 sold. Compared to the previous close, Unified Grade C rose by 4,000 yuan, and miscellaneous bonds all rose by 3,000 yuan, with a turnover of approximately 2 million.</p>
<p>Foreign stocks still showed signs of tension yesterday. The steel industry suddenly encountered a large number of speculators scrambling to buy, and supply could not meet demand, resulting in price increases. The paper industry was helpful, with both Guangdong merchants and foreign merchants buying. Yisha opened in the morning at 1.23 million, with the high price approaching 1.3 million, and then leveled off slightly. As a result of the comparison with the previous closing, paper industry stocks rose, steel industry stocks rose by 20%, shipping industry stocks rose by 10%, and the rest rose by 5%.</p>
<h3>Interest Rates on Special Fund Deposits Increased Across the Board Weekly</h3>
<p>It was recently learned from the National Bank's Treasury Bureau that regarding the interest rates on special fund deposit accounts, except for those that do not accrue interest, those originally paying 8 li per week will be uniformly increased to 1.2 fen per week, calculated from December 21, 1947.</p>
<h3>Strong Demand for Export Tea</h3>
<p>Since domestic tea has been continuously sought after by buyers, yesterday in the market, due to the continuous shipments from this street to Suzhou, Wuxi, and other places, inquiries were still quite enthusiastic, and the process remained unabated. As for the foreign tea market, negotiations were also very frequent, and people's sentiments were generally stable, with a tendency for black tea to remain firm and green tea to advance rapidly. The reason for this is that the former has balanced imports and exports with little change, while the latter has empty inventories, with holders seeking higher prices, leading to a rapid increase in price.</p>
<p>According to industry sources, it was recently learned that exporters in this city suddenly received a telegram from North Africa requesting the purchase of over 500 boxes of green tea, mostly Ping Shui Pearl Tea and Tunxi Zhenmei. Unfortunately, the supply of these goods is about to run out, and there is a tendency for supply to be insufficient. Looking ahead, the situation is likely to become even more acute.</p>
<h3>Spring Seeds Insufficient Supply, Only Over One Million Sheets Cultivated in Four Provinces</h3>
<p>According to relevant sources, the output of silkworm seeds from various seed production farms for both the spring and autumn seasons of 1947 failed to meet the projected targets. The situation was similar in various farms in Sichuan Province. The mulberry gardens of the Yunnan Provincial Sericulture New Village Company are large in scale and well-equipped, but the silkworm seeds produced last year and transported to Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces for distribution were damaged en route, and this year's seed production was also reduced, resulting in a tendency for the spring seeds this year to be insufficient in supply.</p>
<p>In order to utilize the superior equipment of the New Village Company to solve the problem of silkworm seed supply in the future, the silkworm seed industry in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces has cooperated with the New Village Company to cultivate silkworms and produce seeds. After a trial run in the autumn of 1947, it is planned to increase or decrease the production amount annually based on actual needs. The production volume of silkworm seeds in the four provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Sichuan, and Yunnan last autumn and this spring is recorded below:</p>
<p>Seeds used in the autumn of 1947: Jiangsu and Zhejiang: 557,415 (sheets). Sichuan: 325,000. Yunnan: 16,000. Total: 898,415. Seeds used in the spring of 1948: Jiangsu and Zhejiang: 1,086,239 (sheets). Sichuan: 145,000. Yunnan: 140,000.</p>
<h3>Stable Cigarettes</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the cigarette market saw brisk trading due to healthy demand from all parties, and prices were also firm. Later, near the close, due to the notification of goods allocation from cigarette companies such as Sino-American, Xingkang, Huamei, etc., the spot market supply suddenly became abundant, and the financial conditions of those in the industry tightened, leading to a surge in selling pressure in the market, and prices stopped rising and turned weak. However, as a result, ten-stick packs of Great Britain Old Knife cigarettes still saw an increase of 1.55 million to 1.6 million yuan compared to the previous day. In addition, American goods and canned cigarettes rose by 4,000 to 5,000 yuan, while Chinese merchant cigarettes saw mixed increases and decreases.</p>
<h3>Rising Industrial Raw Materials</h3>
<p>Among industrial raw materials, caustic soda and beeswax saw continuous price increases due to strong demand from soap and candle manufacturers. Monthly brand caustic soda rose to 89 million yuan per barrel, and American goods rose to 87 million yuan per barrel. The price of soda ash also rose sharply, with monthly brands reaching as high as 8 million yuan. Beeswax rose to 8.5 million yuan per picul. Other various types of products such as Trigonal brand glycerine, baking soda, bleaching powder essence, etc., saw an average daily increase of 10% to 20%.</p>

<h3>The Drinking Water Problem of Shanghai Residents</h3>
<p>— Canglong</p>
<p>Everyone knows that water is necessary for life, but they don't know that water is the most important thing for maintaining our lives. Let's take those who fast as an example. Some people in India can fast for 49 days, but they cannot go without drinking water for even one day. Let's also take animals for an experiment. If we remove 20% of the total water content in an animal's body, then this animal will die due to insufficient water. From this reasoning, it can be seen how important water is to life.</p>
<p>Thank Heaven for bringing us from the inland to this Shanghai area with tap water! Thanks to the British, who installed tap water facilities in Shanghai, which was previously known as a semi-colony, allowing us to fortunately drink this clean water. This is definitely not an overstatement! If we travel to the inland once, we will see that in places where there is water, people are washing toilets on one side and drawing water for cooking on the other. As for water-scarce areas in the Northwest, the water problem is even more unimaginable. Therefore, we should be proud of being able to enjoy tap water in Shanghai.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, this proud enjoyment of ours has not lasted for very long. Since the outbreak of the Pacific War, the tap water in Shanghai has gradually deteriorated. At first, the amount of water was insufficient, and later it was no longer tap water. When we take a bath, we often find many red threadworms in the bathtub. As for the turbidity of the color and the increase in sediment, that goes without saying. At that time, we certainly felt uncomfortable and hoped to be able to drink the clean tap water from before again. However, under enemy control, we could only hope for the dawn.</p>
<p>And now the dawn has come, and it has been more than two years since the dawn. Can we regain the enjoyment from before? I cannot say, I dare not say. I can only tell everyone one sentence: "Every time I drink salty boiled water or salty tea that doesn't taste like tea, I can only sigh and shake my head."</p>
<p>Of course, some people will ask me, "Why has the tap water deteriorated?" "Is it because the salty Huangpu River water has seeped into the tap water?" "Is it because the tap water's sand filtration work is not thorough enough?" "Is it..." These questions are what all Shanghai residents want to know. But, I cannot say, I dare not say.</p>
<p>I have already said above that water is the most important thing for maintaining human life, so tap water, which is related to the lives of millions of people in Shanghai, is of course very important. Therefore, the municipal authorities should comprehensively plan and properly solve "the problem of the supply of the entire amount of water," "the problem of the composition of the water," "the problem of the inspection of the water," "the problem of the clarification of the water," "the problem of the filtration of the water," and "the problem of the disinfection of the water," etc.</p>
<p>I remember that in 1884, cholera bacteria accidentally seeped into the tap water pipes in Hamburg, Germany, resulting in the Hamburg plague (with more than 100,000 deaths), which shocked the world. Now it is the time when winter is passing and spring is coming, everything is sprouting, and all bacteria are waiting for an opportunity to move. I now hope that the city authorities will quickly review and improve the tap water problem, which is related to the safety of the lives of millions of city residents, so as to avoid causing an irreparable disaster in the future. In that case, it wouldn't matter if I drank more salty water or salty tea.</p>
<h3>A Casual Discussion on Asthma and its Treatment</h3>
<p>— Liang Junqing</p>
<p>When we see patients, we often encounter those who come to request treatment for asthma. In fact, asthma itself is a symptom of various diseases, and does not refer to a specific disease. For example, people with heart disease can have asthma, people with nervous bronchial asthma can also have asthma, and people with nephritis or diabetes can also develop asthma in certain situations. In addition, conditions such as nervous disorders and pulmonary emphysema, pulmonary edema, etc., often have asthma symptoms. Therefore, we must investigate the root cause of asthma and carefully examine the source of the disease beforehand, so that we can determine whether the disease has a chance of recovery and prescribe the right medicine for the symptoms. However, in terms of the frequency of illness, nervous bronchial asthma is the most likely to occur, the most frequently found, and the most painful of all asthma diseases. Therefore, this article is specifically written as a compass for such patients.</p>
<p>As the name suggests, the nervous bronchial asthma mentioned in this article (Western name Asthmabranchiale) is of course a type of bronchial asthma related to nerve function. This is because its symptoms during an attack are entirely a sudden, episodic bronchospasm phenomenon controlled by nerves (when the disease is not attacking, the patient is no different from a normal person). The chest cavity is in an inhalation state, and the action of exhaling air is very difficult. When exhaling air, the bronchial mucosa and the smallest bronchiolar mucosa are in a state of redness and swelling, secreting a large amount of mucus. This mucus must be discharged with great difficulty with the aid of the contraction of the bronchiolar wall muscles. According to clinical investigations, 90% of patients belong to allergic diseases, and asthma occurs immediately when an allergic reaction occurs to a certain substance. It can also occur in a state of bad mood or emotional excitement, and it is especially easy to suffer when the tenth cranial nerve (i.e., the vagus nerve) becomes diseased.</p>
<p>Causes</p>
<p>Although patients with this disease are not limited to age and gender, from a clinical statistical point of view, children are the most common patients. Among children, it is most common between the ages of two and four. This is because the cause of this disease is mostly due to nervous allergic reactions. Children are not born for a long time, and are prone to allergic reactions to external substances. Moreover, children's physical qualities are largely inherited from their parents, and once they encounter qualities that are contrary to those transmitted by their parents, it is easy to have antagonistic allergic reactions. As for external substances that can stimulate patients to develop asthma, there are many types of allergens, such as certain dusts, certain air, certain climates, certain proteins, certain foods, and certain drugs, numbering dozens that cannot be fully listed for the time being. The Belgian scholar Stormvan Leerwen has done great research on this. The German Saxon Serum Factory once had an injectable substance for testing asthma. If it can be determined which of these dozens of allergens is the cause of asthma, then the treatment problem will be easily solved in the future, and the method is perfect. Unfortunately, although this method is very effective, it is sometimes ineffective. In the end, it cannot be said to be perfect. Recently, someone examined the urine of asthma patients during an asthma attack and found that there were many endocrines similar to proteins, and the tests were consistently accurate. As a result, many scholars believe that asthma is related to the endocrine system and advocate treating it with endocrines. This method is of course more novel and reasonable in principle, but it is still in the experimental stage and has not dared to be made public to sway public opinion.</p>
<p>Symptoms</p>
<p>Patients with this disease often have had several different kinds of symptoms in their previous medical history, such as frequent eczema in both ears, and frequent eczema on the face and limbs. Any part of the skin that was originally healthy as usual will immediately become red, swollen, and inflamed after being scratched, or even develop vesicles that secrete liquid. This type of patient is more likely to develop asthma in the future.</p>
<p>This disease usually occurs at night, or it can occur during the day and worsen at night. At the beginning, there may be coughing or immediate asthma, it is very difficult to exhale air, making a wheezing sound, and when inhaling air, the chest expands, and the ribs lengthen and become clearly visible like a patient with rickets. The muscles and blood vessels in the neck are in a sunken spasmodic state. If examined with a stethoscope, there are flute sounds and bubbling sounds everywhere in the chest. This phenomenon is very obvious, and once observed, it can be remembered forever and cannot be forgotten. As for the duration of this episodic symptom, it generally lasts for a day or two before it subsides and becomes a mild cough, and gradually returns to normal. At this time, if the patient has completely recovered, he is no different from a normal person, and it is impossible to recognize the embarrassing state he was in when the disease attacked.</p>
<p>We often read in textbooks that "the white blood cells of asthma patients often have increased eosinophils (Eosinophilie) and the sputum contains Curschmann spirals and Leyden crystals," but in fact, it is just empty talk. In clinical practice, it is often impossible to obtain these results. It is almost true that believing everything in books is worse than having no books.</p>
<p>Treatment methods</p>
<p>As mentioned earlier, most patients with this disease have nervous allergic reactions. Therefore, the treatment of this disease should of course target the cause of the disease. For example, those who develop asthma after eating fish and shrimp must abstain from fishy foods in the future. Also, those who develop asthma when they smell a certain flower fragrance must avoid this pollen in the future. In addition, those who are intolerant of humid weather must move to a place with a high and dry climate. There are too many cases like this to list them all, and you must be able to respond flexibly and draw inferences about other cases from one instance.</p>
<p>Those who treated asthma in the past often liked to use ephedra preparations, Adrenalin, Asthmolysin, etc. These drugs are very effective quickly, but the effect of the drugs also wears off quickly. They are so-called drugs that treat the symptoms but not the root cause. If the attack is very severe, it can be used temporarily to deal with the emergency, but it cannot be used for a long time. Long-term use will not only have little effect, but also promote hardening of the blood vessels.</p>
<p>Among antispasmodics, drugs such as Atropine, Ext. Belladonn Erpado can also help in an emergency, but their side effects are very large, and they should not be tried lightly unless used by a doctor. In addition, sulfur preparations, protein preparations, tuberculin vaccine, Pepton, and endocrines all have therapeutic effects, but they fall within the scope of use by doctors and will not be listed here.</p>
<p>I like to use benzoin inhalant and potassium iodide for asthma patients, and I often get miraculous results, because it can not only resolve phlegm and relieve cough, but also eliminate bronchial spasms. As for calcium preparations and vitamin BC, they are also very helpful in the treatment of this disease. In short, since this disease is a nervous allergic reaction, the treatment method must start from this direction. The various treatment methods mentioned above are all aimed at avoiding the occurrence of allergies. As for the various technical problems in treatment, it depends on the guidance of a specialist doctor.</p>
<h3>Good Medicine During the Treatment of Lung Diseases</h3>
<p>— Huang Jun</p>
<p>Although an effective medicine for pulmonary tuberculosis has not yet been invented, pulmonary tuberculosis is not a difficult disease. Wealthy people who discover symptoms early can rest in places with fresh air. Those who discover it late only need to inject air and cut ribs. If they are well taken care of, the percentage of recovery is definitely the majority. The suffering lies in the fact that the general public who have no money have to bear the expenses of the family even when they have lung disease. While still burying their heads in work, they are also worried about the economy, so the hope of recovery is less.</p>
<p>After suffering from pulmonary tuberculosis, one will definitely immediately suffer from severe hysteria, depression, suspicion, irritability... all follow one after another. Lin Daiyu, with her thousand beauties, is a typical example in the Dream of the Red Chamber. At that time, patients needed to lie quietly in order to recuperate, so the mess came. They analyzed every extremely simple thing into an extremely complex and tedious matter, and it was often unfavorable to them. For example, if the sister-in-law accidentally winked at the brother, then in bed, they would evolve this matter into something mysterious and profound, and even associate it with the possibility that the two of them might unite the entire family to adopt some policy towards the annoying patient. Sometimes, not only that, but also a terrifying thought would arise out of thin air, stimulating them to shiver. This is partly because their pain stimulates their nerves, and partly because their minds are nowhere to be placed while lying in bed, and hallucinations will naturally emerge one after another. But these hallucinations are often painful and detrimental to the body, so their disease gradually deepens. There are not a few patients with lung disease who even die due to mental breakdown.</p>
<p>However, it is impossible for patients to automatically abandon these hallucinations and seek happiness. If it is to be done, it must be added with great, sacrificial love. But the supply of this point is not enough on the family's side. Because the patient is irritable, they often become cold-hearted, and sometimes even complain to the patient with cold words. They think that with such a comfortable ward, such exquisite food, and expensive needles, medicines, and tonics, the patient should be satisfied, and they themselves seem to have fulfilled their duties. However, this is precisely "losing all one's efforts for lack of one final accomplishment." A sincere person who visits the sick can hear the patient complaining about the family's treatment of him, even to the point of tears.</p>
<p>Love, perhaps it includes maternal love, friendship, and love, etc. Young patients, for example, need love to support their courage to survive. I have a friend who has lung disease. He can't inject air, and his family all advised him to have surgery, but he is a coward and refuses to die. Later, the family was so anxious that they invited his lover to persuade him. The girlfriend said to him very sweetly, "If you have the surgery, I will marry you." My friend agreed immediately without even thinking about it. As for children with lung disease, perhaps they get better faster. On the one hand, because maternal love is great, she takes care of him all day and night. On the other hand, children don't have any thoughts, and they don't know what sorrow is. They can sleep and eat, and the disease will naturally get better faster. The most miserable are the single young people. I have a friend who lives with his brother, and he doesn't even have a sister-in-law. After he developed lung disease, he also developed pleurisy. Later, because the doctor didn't see him properly, it turned into TB pleurisy. He was bedridden for five or six years and still hasn't gotten better. His brother goes to work at noon, and he is so lonely that he doesn't know what to do. He can't work, so he has to keep reading a book. Sometimes when I go to see him, I always feel sorry for him for not finding a girlfriend before he got sick. Now no one denies his mental depression. I estimate that he still has six years of illness to live, but his spirit can only support at most two years.</p>
<p>So, if there are any patients with pulmonary tuberculosis among you, don't forget to find the patient great, sacrificial love. It is just like other needles, medicines, and tonics, it is a vitamin that people with pulmonary tuberculosis cannot lack.</p>
<h3>Medical News</h3>
<p>— Cang Long</p>
<p>(1) Vaccination Can Treat Ulcerative Stomatitis</p>
<p>Ulcerative stomatitis can sometimes occur in the mouth, causing not only extreme pain but also being extremely difficult to cure. Many scholars have tried using arsenic preparations, or vitamin C, vitamin B1, vitamin B2, and nicotinic acid, etc., as treatments, but the results have been uncertain, sometimes effective and sometimes not at all. According to a report by Professor Laubert of Switzerland, this type of stomatitis is caused by a filterable viral toxin. If patients are vaccinated, they will recover immediately.</p>
<p>(2) Diabetes Can Accelerate the Deterioration of Pulmonary Tuberculosis</p>
<p>According to a report in last year's British Medical Journal, if diabetes patients are not given appropriate treatment, it is very easy to accelerate the deterioration of their accompanying pulmonary tuberculosis. Therefore, Dr. W.R. Gaud and Dr. A. Lyall strongly advocated in the article that all diabetes patients must have their lungs examined twice a year with X-rays. If patients often have colds, nasal congestion, or chronic pharyngitis and bronchitis, they should also have their sputum or gastric juice tested at any time to prevent the development of pulmonary tuberculosis in secret.</p>
<p>If acute mastitis occurs after childbirth, a large dose of penicillin (100,000 units injected intramuscularly twice a day) and a small dose of ovarian preparations (1mg taken orally three times a day) can be injected, and recovery can be achieved completely within three or four days.</p>
<p>(4) New Method to Prevent Measles</p>
<p>According to a report by Dr. PTatchell of London, in addition to injecting serum from someone who has had measles to prevent the occurrence of measles during a measles epidemic, washing the nasal mucosa with warm boric acid water every day can also have the same effect.</p>
<p>(5) New Method for Treating Persistent Sores</p>
<p>According to a report by Dr. J.A. Wolfer of Chicago, USA, persistent sores are often caused by a deficiency in vitamin C. If a large dose of vitamin C is given, the recovery will be very rapid.</p>
<h3>Small Statistics on National Medical Institutions</h3>
<p>— Wang Juerong</p>
<p>The following are the national medical and pharmaceutical education institutions:</p>
<p>National University Affiliated Medical Colleges 15</p>
<p>National Medical Colleges 6</p>
<p>Provincial Medical Colleges 3</p>
<p>Provincial Medical Specialized Schools 5</p>
<p>Private University Affiliated Medical Colleges 6</p>
<p>Private Medical Colleges 7</p>
<p>A total of 42 schools are distributed in 27 cities across the country:</p>
<p>The 42 schools have a total of:</p>
<p>Faculty 1055</p>
<p>Students 10765</p>
<p>An average of 10 to 11 students are taught by each teacher</p>
<p>The distribution density in the 27 cities is as follows:</p>
<p>Shanghai 7 schools, Hangzhou, Beiping, and Guangzhou 3 schools each</p>
<p>Taiyuan, Jinan, Xi'an, and Nanchang 2 schools each</p>
<p>The other 19 cities have 1 school each</p>
<p>Among the 42 schools:</p>
<p>The school with the most students is: National Shenyang Medical College, with 777 students</p>
<p>The school with the most professors is: also "Shen Da", with 164 people</p>
<p>The school with the fewest students is: Private Sino-French University Medical College, with 10 students</p>
<p>The schools with the fewest professors are: Private Sino-French University Medical College and National Zhejiang University Medical College, with 3 people each. The school with the most graduates in 1946 was: Private Tongde Medical College, with 91 people!</p>
<p>The physician output of the 42 schools is:</p>
<p>5119 people in the ten years from 1936 to 1945</p>
<p>976 people in 1946</p>
<p>Total output in eleven years 6095 people</p>
<p>Average annual output 555 people</p>
<p>At this rate of production, to achieve the plan of one physician for every 2,000 people, it will take until at least the 60th year of the Republic of China! This is assuming that the national population does not increase and physicians do not ascend to the heavenly realm!</p>
<p>There are a total of 6 dental schools in the country, distributed in four major cities</p>
<p>The 6 schools have a total of 132 faculty members and 275 students</p>
<p>167 dentists graduated in the ten years from 1936 to 1945</p>
<p>17 graduates in 1946</p>
<p>A total of 184 dentists were produced in eleven years</p>
<p>The average annual production nationwide is only 17 people! That is, one new dentist can be allocated for every 26 million people each year!</p>
<p>There are a total of 11 pharmacy schools in the country, distributed in eight major cities across the country. The 11 schools have a total of 639 students. A total of 713 pharmacists graduated in the eleven years from 1936 to 1946.</p>
<p>The average annual production of pharmacists is 63 people! That is, one new pharmacist is added for every 7 million people each year!</p>
<p>(Note: The above figures are all based on statistics from the Ministry of Education. Due to the haste in writing the manuscript and the fact that it was all done late at night, there may be inaccuracies. Your understanding is appreciated.)</p>
<p>According to the statistics of the delegate quota allocation table of the Second National Federation of Physicians' Associations, the 25 provinces and cities that have established provincial and municipal associations have a total of 17,903 members. Assuming that the other 35 regional provinces and cities that have not established associations have more than 5,000 members, the total number of physicians in the country should not exceed 22,500! This is suitable for one-tenth of the number of physicians that should be available in the five-year plan of the highest authorities! It has been two and a half years since the victory! I don't know if the health and education authorities have paid attention to this?</p>
<p>Physicians are like this, and dentists are even rarer! It is said that the total number of dentists in the country does not exceed 1,500!</p>
<p>There is an average of one dentist for every 300,000 people. If every citizen has their teeth checked once a year, then each dentist must examine 1,000 patients every day, excluding Sundays and holidays. If we calculate eight hours of work, each dentist should examine at least two patients per minute!</p>
<p>If we calculate at a normal rate of half an hour per patient, then a dentist can treat 16 patients per day. If, unfortunately, every citizen suffers from a dental disease once in their lifetime, then 300,000 patients will need another 60 years! In other words, if a seven-year-old child has a dental disease and registers for treatment, they will have to wait until they are 67 years old to be seen! The "wet behind the ears" child has become an old man with "child's face and crane's hair." The patient will never forget the kindness and virtue of this dentist with thriving business! I respectfully ask the delegates of the National Federation of Physicians' Associations to take note of this.</p>
<h3>On the Medical Profession Going to the Countryside (Part 2)</h3>
<p>— Xu Jing</p>
<p>Why are doctors concentrated in cities? The answer is that they have no better place to go, so they stay in cities because modern medicine is a part of applied science. New medicine and new drugs are dependent on each other. Most foreign medicines are concentrated and distributed in cities, and medical equipment and hospital facilities rely on electricity and water supply. Remote rural areas not only lack electricity and water supply, but they don't even have a decent house. I came back from Jiawang and Xuzhou and saw houses made of earth all the way. They are like earth kilns with only one hole, which serves as both the door and the window. Don't laugh, that is where most of our compatriots eat, sleep, and take shelter from the wind. Because Jiawang Town has a Huadong Coal Mining Company, there are still some modern buildings, schools, hospitals, and water and electricity supplies, which have already become a small city. However, the lack of sufficient medicines often makes it difficult for doctors. Closed-off customs and traffic obstruction are the greatest enemies of modern civilization, and they are also the greatest enemies of new medicine and new drugs. Some places have not yet been opened up. They would rather believe in witches than ask for doctors, and they would rather believe in gods and monsters than in science. This depends on education to lead the way, and then literacy can be popularized. Some townships have no formal doctors because of this. They are all dominated by quack doctors. They hang up the signs of Western medicine and do shady business; those who know a little about injection techniques hang up advertisements promising a cure with one injection. This not only harms people's lives, but also makes people misunderstand that Western medicine is just that. However, when formal doctors occasionally go to the countryside, they are not accustomed to their tricks. They don't brag or perfunctorily treat patients, but often return empty-handed. It turns out that rural doctors often have to walk dozens of miles to make a house call (take a boat if there is one, or walk if there isn't), and they are not allowed to charge a separate house call fee. The fee includes the medicine fee, and only a total amount is charged. (A doctor told me that house calls in the countryside are different from those in the city. If villagers ask for a doctor, the doctor must go. If the doctor doesn't go, people will criticize him, which will affect his business. After the house call, only a total amount can be charged. If you want to list the items in detail, the villagers will definitely be dissatisfied.) You can ask for as much as you can get. Doctors who don't know how to do this or disdain to do it cannot stand their ground. Therefore, those who succeed in the countryside are not necessarily good doctors, but old hands who know the psychology of the villagers. The so-called countryside here is only limited to the townships along the railway lines. It is still the territory of quack doctors. In other remote areas, I am afraid that there aren't even any half-baked quack doctors.</p>
<p>Doctors in cities are not without intention of going to the countryside. To be honest, even in Shanghai, there are not many doctors who have a fixed income. The rest are only staying in Shanghai because they have no better place to go. On the one hand, it is because there is almost no clean place due to wars everywhere (a friend of mine who works in a hospital in Beiping recently wrote a letter wanting to come to Shanghai). On the other hand, even if they intend to "open a market" (go to the countryside), the difficulties are as described above, so there are many who hesitate to go. This includes education, construction, and transportation problems, which cannot be solved by doctors alone. Thinking of this waste of talent, it is really regrettable.</p>
<p>There are many surplus materials on Fuxing Island that are allowed to rot and be damaged, including a large number of cars, food, and medicine. Some people have already cried out loudly, but no one seems to lament this waste of specialized talent. Chairman Chiang Kai-shek said in "China's Destiny" that with the vast territory of China, there need to be more than 200,000 doctors to be sufficient for distribution, but how many years of effort does it take to create a doctor? Now the number of doctors is still less than one-tenth of the minimum target, but they are still allowed to rot in the cities!</p>
<p>The low salaries of doctors serving in municipal hospitals are forcing many outstanding talents to leave and become independent, resulting in a dense distribution of private clinics and increasing competition, while hospital performance is only so-so. Recently, Director Zhang of the Municipal Health Bureau intended to resign. The biggest reason is said to be the lack of funding and the low salaries of public officials, which makes it impossible to attract specialized talent, so that many plans cannot be implemented. This is such a contradictory phenomenon! If our society needs specialized talent to build, it should give them special treatment. This will not only allow them to work with peace of mind, but also encourage people and reward talent. In the past, someone wanted to buy a thoroughbred horse, and someone deceived him with a dead horse. The buyer recognized that it was the bone of a thoroughbred horse and paid a high price for it. As a result, countless good horses came to his door. Now, it is the opposite. You want the horse to run, but you don't feed it enough. How can talent not leave!</p>
<p>I have met several colleagues who are very tired of the city and believe that doctors in the city are only serving the wealthy (due to the high cost of medical care, the poor have long been excluded from medical care). If someone can guarantee their livelihood, they are willing to go to the countryside to serve. But the problem now is that there is no such guarantor. For the sake of livelihood, they can only stay in this city that they are so tired of!</p>

<h3>Talking About "Defeatism"</h3>
<p>— Wu Yong</p>
<p>To do something well, you must deeply believe that you can do it well. This is a necessary condition for "success." I think this principle is very simple.</p>
<p>The February issue of "Reader's Digest" magazine had an "Excerpt" titled "The Range of Mental Activity," by an author named Rhine. According to the author, the results of scientific experiments prove that the power of the mind can be transmitted and can affect matter. For example, when we throw dice, if we are just throwing them for fun, absent-mindedly, and don't take it seriously, then the number of dice that add up in thousands of throws follows the "law of probability" in mathematics; if we concentrate our energy and wholeheartedly want the dice to add up to a certain number when we throw them, according to the author, the result can change the mathematical "law of probability." This means that in thousands of throws, the number of dice that add up to the number we want can appear more often than the "law of probability" allows; and the frequency is directly proportional to the degree of concentration of the thrower's mind. In this way, the author proves that the power of the mind is enough to control matter.</p>
<p>We cannot determine whether the above statement is correct. However, no matter what we do, we must concentrate our energy, do it wholeheartedly, and deeply believe that it will succeed, and then we will have the hope of success. I think this is a certain principle. The Chinese have always emphasized the word "sincerity," the meaning of which is not simple, but in terms of its meaning in doing things, it is nothing more than doing things with "sincerity" and "earnestness." Most temples have a plaque in front of the gods, which reads: "Sincerity Brings Manifestation." Although this is superstition, if we use it as a motto for governing affairs, change it to "Sincerity Brings Success," I think it is not bad.</p>
<p>Conversely, if we are suspicious in our hearts, and feel that something is on the verge of despair, and that it is probably incurable, then our hearts are empty, our will is shifted, and we cannot talk about efficiency when doing things. It is naturally difficult to achieve success. Dealing with things in this attitude is what is called "lethargy." If an individual is "lethargic," they cannot embark on the "road to light"; if they extinguish the lamp of "self-confidence," how can they see "light"? This is talking about small personal matters; if it is a major event, then the individual's "lethargy" will spread and affect others, affecting the entire society and country.</p>
<p>This kind of lethargy, to put it in an old saying, is "insincerity" and "lack of determination"; in foreign countries, it is called "defeatism." In recent years, our entire society seems to be immersed in "lethargy," which is undeniable. In terms of economics alone, we have heard many "defeatist" arguments in the past year. Some people say: "Only immortals can deal with this situation." Some people say: "Prices will inevitably rise slowly." Still others say: "The price of rice will definitely not be changed again within a month." There are even those who make the following arguments: "After the currency reform in the future, it will take about ten years for the new currency to inflate to the current level." It is unnecessary to say these kinds of words in private; if they come from the mouths of government officials, it is especially inappropriate. Publicly expressing "defeatism" not only does not help the situation but also hinders the overall situation; unintentionally revealing the erroneous idea that "Chinese affairs always go wrong" also has a very significant negative impact on the general public's perception. Why will the price of rice inevitably rise next month? Why will the new currency inflate again after ten years? Leaving aside what will happen next month, how can you predict that the economic situation will be bad after ten years? This simply shows that the speaker has lost confidence in the Chinese nation. These kinds of words are like the cries of crows, symbolizing ominous omens, which are really disgusting to hear. I believe that it is extremely necessary to correct this.</p>
<p>Chinese affairs seem very complicated on the surface, making it difficult to know where to start; but in fact, they must not be completely so. The so-called "calamities" in our country have more "man-made disasters" than "natural disasters." And the so-called "calamities" are by no means as "irreversible" as people generally think. It must be known that the saying "Man will conquer nature" has great truth. It is just that we must hold on to the confidence of "inevitable victory," which is the first step in saving the so-called "calamity." If we are "absent-minded," and adopt the "monk striking the bell" attitude, without intending to do things well, or even intending to mess things up, then it goes without saying that things will not improve.</p>
<p>Secondly, we must be responsible for everything, and not shirk responsibility. It is clearly a "man-made disaster," but it is called a "natural disaster," which is to shirk responsibility. If the situation deteriorates, and it is said that this is due to the entire situation, and that it is impossible for one person or one region to be responsible, this is also to shirk responsibility. There are two theories in philosophy: "objective" and "subjective"; there are also adornments of "environment" and "individual" in society. Those who advocate the "objective theory" say that the "objective" is enough to control the "subjective"; those who advocate the "environmental theory" say that the "environment" is enough to control the "individual." In fact, when the "objective" reaches the end, the "subjective" is the "objective"; when the "environmental theory" reaches the extreme, the "individual" is also a part of the "environment." In other words, the local affairs are a part of the whole situation, and the "whole" is composed of many "parts." The "individual" is a member of the society and the country, and the society and the country are composed of many "individuals." If the "part" is not good, how can we seek the good of the "whole"? If the "individual" is not good, how can we hope that the society and country composed of "individuals" will have good results? If we want to build a pyramid, we must first have neat and square stones. There is no difference in the affairs of society. How can we arbitrarily say that the "environment is bad"? Confucius said: If the person cultivates himself, the family will be regulated; if the family is regulated, the country will be governed; if the country is governed, the world will be at peace. This is also the meaning. If we want to seek peace in the world first, and then cultivate ourselves, then the world will never be at peace. People often say, "Chinese affairs always go wrong." We must first ask: I am also Chinese, am I good myself? Don't be quick to say that others are not good, and don't blame all the bad things on the abstract "environment" or "society" or "country."</p>
<p>We must all optimistically believe that everything can be solved easily. The way to solve it is: start with the individual.</p>
<h3>Random Thoughts on War</h3>
<p>— Mao Ren</p>
<p>The February issue of the American magazine "Crown" used dozens of pieced-together photos to depict "the sad faces of peace," which is extremely apt. It first describes the millions of people who have suffered from the ravages of war, slave laborers, and refugees who have escaped from tyrannical rule, trudging back to their hometowns through unpopulated farmland and destroyed railways and factories. Their old homes, however, are famine-stricken France, Russia, and the Balkans. At the same time, of the 7.7 million Jews in Western Europe, only 1.5 million remain after the war, wandering around and trying to make a living in the Holy Land of Palestine. Then it describes Germany, the defeated country, where people are unemployed and on the verge of starvation. What about the victorious countries? British hotels are empty, clothing relies entirely on rationing, and each person gets one egg and four ounces of sweets per week. The French are sallow and thin. The Italians are even worse off, having tasted the disasters sown by the dictator. The Greeks must fight hard to stabilize their country. In our Asia, India, which was once united in the pursuit of independence and freedom, has now been divided into Hindu India and Muslim Pakistan. In China, millions of famine victims do not know what peace is, internal strife continues, and the flames of war are everywhere. Japan, however, is working hard under the supervision of the Allied forces. Even the United States, which is blessed by heaven and has both geographical advantages and talent, suffers from rising prices and severe housing shortages. Although the theory of a "new war" is mostly propaganda, they know that permanent peace is still far away, like a mirage. The stalemate between the United States and the Soviet Union, one uncompromising and the other determined, is deepening. The threat of the atomic bomb looms, and everyone is at a loss what to do—what a miserable world!</p>
<p>Who made the world so dark, cloudy, and bleak? Of course, it is the dictators and warlords of the invading countries. They are madmen and fools. Wanting to be heroes and conquerors, they do not hesitate to wage wars, causing death and destruction. Therefore, I applaud the execution of war criminals today. However, the method of execution is not very good. I think it should be handled by the people of the ten countries themselves, to show the will of the people and the difficulty of resisting public anger. If the victorious countries make the judgments, no matter how many trials and debates are held, and how many years are spent to show the fairness of the law, there will inevitably be the suspicion of being a victor who is a law unto himself. To make the war criminals who invaded and won also be punished by their own people or the people of the world is, in fact, impossible. It seems easier to have the war criminals who invaded and lost judged by their own people, and it is also justifiable. More importantly, since ordinary patriotism is a good name, and dying at the hands of foreigners is considered a martyr, then if the war criminals of country A are executed by countries B, C, etc., the dead will certainly be proud and comforted by "sacrificing for the country," and their people will also have this feeling. Goering's suicide before his execution won the praise of the Germans, isn't this kind of mentality obvious? In history, few political and military "great heroes" have not been scolded by enlightened people in later generations. What is strange is that even though they are scolded, heroes are still to be made, even at the cost of sacrificing themselves. What is the reason? One of them is: those who scold him also praise him incessantly while scolding him. I remember that at the beginning of the European War, an American reporter scolded Hitler for being damned, saying that he had the same aggressive ambitions as Frederick the Great, and was just as killable. At the time, I thought that if Hitler saw this article, he would definitely say, "I just want to be Frederick. If the late king had not wantonly engaged in aggression, how could he have been called the Great? You, who are scolding him to death, are not praising him incessantly as 'the Great'?" Now, the trial of Tojo and the like, although not crowned with the title of "Japanese loyal and patriotic hero," at least gives him an opportunity to take advantage of, and to make grand speeches for the country and the people, and he has the leisure to write memoirs that allow him to talk nonsense. I think it is inevitably a misstep. The way to remedy this is to quickly kill him and feed him to the dogs. If you say this is inevitably barbaric, then there are many barbaric acts that should be done, so why not be barbaric in places where it should be?</p>
<p>After a great war, the world is naturally inevitable suffering from famine and plagues, just like a patient after major surgery, who will not be as healthy as before. Therefore, if a war can truly stop wars, the world will slowly recover after suffering a little pain. The present hunger and cold are really not worth mentioning. However, the current situation shows that there is a great danger of another war, which will turn into war begetting war. What is the reason for this? A foreigner wrote a book called "Why Europe Fights Again" (referring to World War II), in which there is a very interesting sentence: "Everything in history has no real beginning, just as it has no end. But wars always have a starting point, and the true start of this war was on the day the treaty that was originally intended to end the last war was signed, namely June 28, 1919." If the Third World War unfortunately breaks out, historians in later generations will surely say that this war began when Germany and the Soviet Union went to war and the United Kingdom and the United States declared their full support for the Soviet Union!</p>
<p>War is an evil thing, and every international war has a set of beautiful and moving reasons for war. I think today's political leaders and diplomatic experts, while working for world peace in the United Nations, are already considering the reasons for the next great war, preparing to encourage their countrymen to share the same hatred for the enemy!</p>
<h3>The History of Lion Grove Garden</h3>
<p>— Wang Baili</p>
<p>Publications state that the Lion Grove Garden in Suzhou was built by the late Yuan dynasty painter Ni Yunlin. When I visited the Lion Grove Garden, the guide also spoke of it with certainty. In reality, both are mistaken. According to Liang Zhangju's "Continuation of Random Notes," Volume 1: a guest invited me to revisit the Lion Grove Garden, but I declined with a smile. Among the gardens in Wu County, I particularly dislike the Lion Grove Garden's crampedness, which is quite depressing. Therefore, during the tenure of the former Governor of Suzhou, I once visited it with a friend, but did not record a single word about it. To say that this garden was built by Ni Yunlin is also a mistake. I once heard from Shi Zhu Dangqianjun that during the Zhizheng period of the Yuan dynasty, the monk Tianru Weize invited Zhu Derun, Zhao Shanchang, Ni Yunlin, and Xu Youwen to jointly plan and build it, with Yunlin providing the design. It was named after the "lion's seat" in Buddhist scriptures. During the Ming dynasty, it still belonged to the Huazhi Temple. In the early Qing dynasty, it was occupied by civilians and fell into disrepair for a long time. In the twenty-seventh year of the Qianlong Emperor's southern tour to Wu, the overgrown weeds were cleared, and protective walls were built. Within, there were scenic spots such as Lion Peak, Hanhui Peak, Tuyue Peak, Lixue Hall, Woyun Chamber, Wenmei Pavilion, Zhibai Xuan, Yujian Pond, Binghu Well, Xiuzhu Valley, Little Flying Rainbow, and the Great Stone House. There were also five large pine trees that could be embraced, so it was also known as the Five Pine Garden, which is little known. Based on this, although this garden was not built solely by Ni, Ni did participate in its construction and provided the design. Later generations mistakenly attributed it to him because of his great fame.</p>
<h3>The Wandering Flower</h3>
<p>— Chen Shengyan</p>
<p>Chapter 11: A Heart Full of Suspicion (88)</p>
<p>Zhongjie said, "Does this even need me to say more? Everyone knows that you keep an extremely beautiful little rascal in your house! He hid when I came, and appeared as soon as I left. That person might even be hiding in your room right now!" Qihuan, her lips trembling, said in a shaky voice, "Please be clear, I am not that kind of person!" Zhongjie snorted through his nose and said, "What! You still won't admit it? If I catch that小子, he will be executed immediately. Not only him, but you won't get off easy either. Because of you, I almost lost my job. I'm not willing to be a fool. You quickly call that 小子 out!" Qihuan said, "Chief Miao, please don't listen to other people's gossip. I wouldn't be so base. If I want to make friends, I can do so openly and honestly. Why would I be secretive? This is someone fabricating rumors to intentionally slander us." Zhongjie said, "Anyway, I don't have time to argue with you. If you want to prove your innocence, then come with me! I have nothing more to say. Otherwise, I won't let you off easy! Make your choice." After Zhongjie finished speaking, he stood up, reaching into his pocket. Judging by his expression, it seemed he was about to take out a pistol. Qihuan, by nature, was extremely stubborn. After being repeatedly humiliated by Zhongjie, she had reached her limit. Steel in her heart, she thought to herself that sooner or later, she would die anyway, so why should I continue to placate him! Immediately, she furrowed her brow and said loudly, "You are insulting me too much. I cannot endure your insults! If you want to force me to go with you, that's not going to happen. Don't even think about it. Do whatever you want, I'm not afraid!" Zhongjie shouted, "Fine!" Suddenly, he took out a pistol from his pocket, pointing it at Qihuan's chest, and said, "I'll just shoot you dead!" Qihuan stuck out her chest and moved forward, saying, "Shoot me dead then, I'm not afraid!" At this critical moment, Little Wang Ma and Qihuan's older brother Xiao He rushed in, placing themselves between the two, blocking Zhongjie's gun. It turned out that Xiao He had seen the news in the newspaper today, and heard many rumors from the outside. He felt that his sister had caused such trouble, and it was not a good look for the opera community. He took the newspaper and came to Qihuan's house, originally intending to advise Qihuan to be more discreet and protect her reputation. Unexpectedly, when he walked in, he caught Zhongjie and Qihuan arguing in the room. He didn't want to interrupt, so he and Little Wang Ma quietly listened outside the side door. At first, when he heard Zhongjie scolding Qihuan for keeping a gigolo, he felt indignant. Later, when he saw Zhongjie take out a gun to threaten her, he and Little Wang Ma rushed in, placing themselves between the two and saying, "Please don't resort to violence, let's talk it over." Zhongjie shouted, "Who are you?" Xiao He said, "I am Qihuan's older brother."</p>

<h3>The Wisdom of Animals</h3>
<p>— Mao Yi</p>
<p>The wisdom of life is evident everywhere in the animal kingdom. We casually discuss the extraordinary behaviors of animals, calling it instinct.</p>
<p>For scholars who study animal behavior, this question is as incomprehensible as it is for us. All we can say is to acknowledge that animals, even the lowest of them, possess unbelievable wisdom—but we know that it is so, but not why it is so.</p>
<p>For example, take bees. They have established a culture that humanity could never dream of. They labor, build, and save; they obey laws and punish those who violate them; their lives and actions everywhere demonstrate the highest level of patriotism.</p>
<p>Let us think about the spider and its web. It seems to have studied all the engineering arts. It builds a path to life for itself and sets up a path to death for those who are caught in the net. The sliding rope on a ship, used for escaping during a storm, was improved with reference to the spider web.</p>
<p>Long before the time of Archimedes, the little otter had established one of the basic principles of engineering. Long before humans built the first bridge, the otter had established its dam era. It also built its own winter dwelling and warehouse. Are we willing to treat cats and dogs as mere playthings? The cat is the most sensitive of animals. If you put it in a sack or a box and release it several miles away, it can still find its way back home. The dog is the most loyal; countless heroic dogs have used their wits to save their masters, who are the spirits of all things!</p>
<p>A lost person can find their way home by following the constellations, and we praise this person as clever. However, many horses can carry their lost masters home in the dark of night. Some horses can even carry drunk or unconscious drivers to their destination in the crowded streets of large cities.</p>
<p>This extraordinary sense of direction is most strongly displayed by pigeons. One pigeon once flew from Rome back to its shed in England. It flew over a thousand miles, crossed a series of mountains and twenty miles of ocean, and it only took one month.</p>
<p>Humans pride themselves as the spirits of all things, but when compared in terms of instinct, humans are not "spiritual" in every aspect.</p>
<h3>Methods of Changing Couplets</h3>
<p>— Qing Lei Xuetu</p>
<p>I received the Shenbao on the Lantern Festival in the old lunar calendar and saw in the Hong Kong news that General Li Jishen, who was living there, had written his own Spring Festival couplet: "All Chinese Army officers are my juniors," "All famous generals in Guangdong are my students." What great arrogance! It's like the couplet presented by famous scholars from Zhejiang to the elderly Hanlin scholar Sun (Qiangming) of Ruian during the late Qing dynasty: "All Hanlin scholars in the world are juniors," "Two prime ministers and generals are my students." If old-fashioned essayists were to discuss this matter, even if they didn't say "plagiarism," they would inevitably criticize it as "having a basis." In reality, copying the old is not absolutely unacceptable. Some are "bluer than blue," some are "following in footsteps, unable to catch up," some are "turning iron into gold," and some are "an insult to Xishi." As for whether the copying is good or not, it depends on the factual content, talent, and technique. Regarding the above couplet by Li, whether those military officers were actually his "juniors" or "students" is impossible to determine due to lack of investigation, so it's difficult to comment. The precision of his writing is naturally self-evident. Now, let's talk about the couplet by old Mr. Sun, and the superiority and inferiority will naturally be clear.</p>
<p>Old Mr. Sun was from Ruian County, Wenzhou Prefecture, Zhejiang Province. His name was Qiangming, his style name was Shaofu. He was a Hanlin scholar in the Xin Chou year of the Daoguang era of the Qing dynasty, only in his twenties. In the Dingwei year, he was the co-examiner for the provincial examination, and he selected two historically famous figures, Li Hongzhang and Shen Baozhen, who were both recommended by him. They became Jinshi graduates and entered the Hanlin Academy. During the years when the Taiping Rebellion army fought, he repeatedly won victories. Li held the position of Governor of Jiangsu, was enfeoffed as a First-Class Marquis Weiyi, and rose to the position of Grand Scholar and Governor-General of Zhili. Grand Scholar was the equivalent of prime minister in ancient times. Shen served as Governor of Jiangxi, captured Hong Xiuquan's son Fu, and was also granted a hereditary title. He later served as Governor-General of Liangjiang, also known as "Zhijun," with the authority of a great general. Li and Shen were not only high-ranking officials, but also prominent figures of the time, so "two prime ministers and generals are my students" was indeed worth boasting about. Li and Shen were both Hanlin scholars of the Daoguang era, and by the early years of the Guangxu era, they were veterans of four reigns. Moreover, they were still considered Mr. Sun's students. (Shen had passed away many years when Sun celebrated his seventieth birthday.) Previous colleagues and Xin Chou classmates had passed away one by one. The senior Hanlin officials that were still living were of classes after Mr. Sun, so "all Hanlin scholars in the world are my juniors" was also absolutely true. These two lines can be said to have magnificent imagery. If later generations want to copy them, they should carefully consider it. The best way to learn from the creations of predecessors is to skillfully adapt them, with each reflecting their own identity and spirit. It is wonderful if others cannot see the imitation. Even if others can see the imitation, they should still praise the adaptation's adherence to principles. For example, there was a eulogy couplet on Zeng Wenzheng's "Record of Mourning": "In life, friendship combined mentor and friend," "Throughout eternity, one feather in the clouds." The author, Ouyang, indeed had a relationship of mentor and friend with Zeng Gong. Zeng's status was very fitting with Zhuge Liang's merit, so it was considered a fine work. Therefore, Du Jidao, in his eulogy for Wu Zhipu, also started with "In life, friendship combined mentor and friend." The second line was then replaced with Cao Cao's words to Liu Bei in the "Romance of the Three Kingdoms," "The heroes of the world are only you and me." The three characters "and me" were removed, and the meaning could still be understood. The sentence structure and number of characters were exactly opposite to the first line, both praising old Wu and expressing self-confidence, without leaving any trace. It was truly a clever mind and skillful hand, without any stiffness. Furthermore, the old Beijing opera actor Bu Yaoqing wrote a eulogy for the old opera actor Chen Delin. Because old Wang's age and seniority were much later than old Chen's, but he wasn't his student, the first line also started with "In life, friendship combined mentor and friend." The second line then used the "Song of Everlasting Regret": "One parting, voice and appearance both vanish." Chen and Wang were both outstanding talents in the opera world, and the words "voice and appearance" were intentionally or unintentionally linked, which can be called clever and exquisite, like a seamless garment (this couplet was written by Shi Kan, a Fujian poet who was a friend of Yaoqing). As for Yang Laowu (Shiqi)'s eulogy for Yu Huilao (Shimei), the first line also started with "In life, friendship combined mentor and friend," which was in accordance with the friendship between the two sides. The second line then used "Throughout eternity, one feather in the clouds," which was to elevate Huilao's status, completely copying Ouyang's eulogy for old Zeng. It was easy to write, and could bring a smile. In the early years of the Republic of China (late winter of the Wuwu year), Yuan Hanyun had a fine paper and wanted to write a couplet as a gift. I asked him to first write "How could my articles startle the world," and Hanyun said: The second line must be "in vain, carriages and horses stopped at the riverbank". I said that was too familiar and had to be changed. Bu Linwu said, "Then 'never before have restraints or officials arrived'". I disliked the scholarly air was too heavy, and the phrase "in vain, carriages and horses" were too blatant. In the end, Hanyun revised it to "in vain, I have thrown my heart into writing lyrics", and I wrote it down. Later, I felt that although this pair was appropriate, it was still of the nature of "Hanyun Hut," because he was a full-fledged "lyricist," but the Ling Han Pavilion had never put this much effort into it.</p>
<p>The "Worry and Joy Magazine" once published an elegy for Zhang Weiping's mother, who remained chaste after her husband died, born on the fifteenth day of the winter month, and died in the middle of autumn: "Following her husband what, following her son what, great integrity, life and death, friendship is important," "the fifteenth day of the winter month, the fifteenth day of mid-autumn, clear light coming and going, the moon is bright in the middle." The second line has the same meaning as the second line of Zhang Sima's elegy for Madam Shen Wensu: "Born in mid-autumn, died in mid-autumn, a bright moon in the sky, a fairy in a rainbow skirt proves her previous life," but each is unique in its appearance.</p>

<p>Reader Consultation Legal Interpretation</p>
<p>Old mother and weak sister, rebellious son acts as a tyrant, seizes inheritance and intends to swallow it alone, abundant farmland only creates evil for descendants</p>
<p>Wang Zhifang asked: A certain woman, Jia, lost her husband. She had one son and three daughters. After painstakingly raising them to adulthood, her eldest son, after getting married, though with an ample income, neglected his mother and sisters. Her late husband left behind quite a bit of real estate, but did not leave a will before his death. Her son intends to seize it all for himself. Now there are several questions, please answer them: (1) What proportion should this inheritance be divided according to? Is it illegal for Jia's son to try to seize it all? (2) Do the two married daughters have the right to inherit? (3) Jia's son intends to seize the property and therefore published a statement saying: "The real estate cannot be sold without his consent," is this legal? (4) All the deeds of the land are in Jia's son's hands, but the account name is still the late husband's name, and it has not been transferred. Now Jia is marrying off her daughter, can she use this property? (5) Jia wanted to divide the property, but her son opposed it and failed. What should be done according to law? (6) Jia's son disregards his mother's life, how should she ask him for support? (7) If a son abuses his biological mother, can he be charged with abandonment according to law?</p>
<p>[Legal Advisor Mr. Tang Mingshi answers]</p>
<p>(1) According to the current law, when a spouse and direct descendants are co-inheritors, their share should be divided equally among the other inheritors. (Refer to Article 1144, Paragraph 1 and Article 1138 of the Civil Code). (2) According to the current law, whether married or unmarried, women have the right to inherit. However, the question is whether the date of Jia's husband's death was before the women obtained the right to inherit. (3) Jia's son is also one of the joint inheritors. The published statement that it cannot be sold without his consent is effective. (4) Before the division, it cannot be determined which property each person should inherit. In this case, it should be divided first, and then each can dispose of their own property. (5) This case can be sued for division of property. (6) A lawsuit should be filed for support according to law. (Refer to Articles 1114 to 1121 of the Civil Code). (7) If it meets the conditions for abandonment, a criminal lawsuit can be filed. Article 290 of the Criminal Law stipulates that the penalty for abandoning direct relatives is increased by one-half.</p>
