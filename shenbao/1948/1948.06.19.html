<h3 id="c14">監察院全院審查大會　通過監察院法草案　同意權行駛辦法亦修正通過　今提第五次院會討論 <a href="#c14" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e14" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">14</a></h3>
<p>〔本報南京十八日電〕行憲第一屆監院第五次會議，定十九日舉行，討論監察法及同意權行使辦法草案。又各委會組織法草案及監委行署組織案件，將再舉行起草委會，予以討論後提大會討論。</p>
<p>監察法草案及監院同意權行使辦法草案已於十八日整日舉行之全院審查委會修正通過。</p>
<p>監察法內容</p>
<p>監察法共六章，上午通過總則及糾正兩章午後共通過彈劾·糾舉·調查·附則四章，其中彈劾一章，討論較久，修正亦多。同時對處理案件之時限亦予硬性規定，本章內規定彈劾案，經提案委員外之監委九人以上之審查及決定，監院應即將被彈劾人移付懲戒，彈劾案之審查應由全體監委按序輸流祖任，如審查後認爲不應交付懲戒，而提案委員有異議時，應即將該彈劾案另付其他委會審查爲最後之決定。凡此規定，均在避免少數委員之態斷與輕易決定。本日討論後，復在該軍之末加列一條：「被彈劾人員在懲戒案進行期間，不得升遷。」此乃由於過去之經驗而來，凡某人之貪污違法，一經揭發，必予他調，終至無法追究。</p>
<p>同意權內容</p>
<p>同意權行使辦法草案全案共十條，其中規定之程序爲監院行使同意權，應由全院委員審查會審查後，提出監院會議投票；全院審查會應就總統提名之人員所附履歷證件加以審查，該會由委員互推一人爲主席，其會議以秘密行之。多數委員對此點，認爲總統之提名，監院同意與否，本爲不可知之事，但如不事先審查，則一員被提名人遭受不同意，則有失總統之威信，亦對被提名者不利，故予秘密會議行之；而秘密會議之舉行，亦僅在防止旁聽之新聞記者，與立院之公開爭辯，實大相逕庭。</p>

<p>加強　亂與安定經濟，爲新政院施政方針的兩大重點；但旬日以來，物復漲風特別熾烈，立院監院及其他各方面，對於經濟上的緊急措施，尤爲焦念。</p>
<p>翁院長的物價政策，曾在立院兩度宣佈，以往拋售物資，緊縮發行，運用美援物資，發行庫券，發行國營事業股票等辦法，仍將繼續推行，同時將以充分供應與普徧配售爲抑平物價的對策，這當然不能說他是錯的。不過這些辦法，除國營事業股票的發行，迄今未見具體化外，而各地物價，波瀾迭起，漲多跌少，其所漲的程度，並在繼長增高之中，幾乎漫無止境，可知單彈這些老調，並不能作爲眞正的緊急措施，亦斷不能達到安定經濟的目的。</p>
<p>物價之所以飛漲，其原因自然很多；但綜合起來，總不外乎通貨太多與物資太少這兩個主要因素，滬是任何人所不能否認的。就前一項而論，在軍用浩　與國家收支無法平衡的時候，好像增發通貨，已成了天經地義的辦法，負責當局，屢次公然宣佈，這是不得已的應急手段。但這話是否究全靠得住，究竟有沒有其他補救的辦法，似乎還值得研討。</p>
<p>據財部最近所編製的下半年國家預算，其全部收人爲五百四十餘萬億元，其支出預算尚在編製之中，據稱：其數額仍超過收入頸算之總和，大約普通收支可望平衡，特別支出須另行設法，其必須另行設法，即不能不靠增發鈔票來彌補虧額，在沒有正式宣佈以前，自無從加以正確的估計。不過當前可以增加的收入，其項目與總額，亦不在少數。王財長宣佈之四種方式爲：（一）增闢稅源，整頓稅入；（二）利用美援；（三）出售救濟物資；　出售敵偽物資。此外尚有剩餘物資，賠價物資，沒收充公的漢奸財產，和美援物資變售以後所得的現款部份，總計起來，其數目應十分可觀。即三億美元，分別十二個月開支，以每月二千五百萬美元計，有人估計，亦可抵用到法幣五十萬億元。那麼，現在的虧空，縱使如王財長所稱：五月份之收人爲十五萬億元，支出爲七十五萬億元，相差達六十萬億元之鉅，而其六分之五，已不難藉此彌補。況國營事業發行股票，備充法幣準備金部份，又公認爲在管理通貨之下，其　伶及多寡，實際上並無多大意義，不如變充現款，抵補歲用，較爲　實有效。如果照此辦理，則今年下半年之收支不敷數目，並不是絕對沒有辦法。倘或可以設法填補，則無論是全部或局部，其仰賴增鈔的程度，必將因而減少或不必要，從而通貨膨脹的趨勢，亦自可因而停止或緩和。所以當前最緊要的措施，應爲（一）從速擬定可以填補的方法和數字；（二）實踐減政的諾言，將一切駢枝重複之機構及冗員，和不必要或不急要之事業經費，悉予限期裁併刪減；（三）按期宣佈發行的準確數字及以後可以停發或減發的實際狀況，如立發顧　　所提設立法幣發行管理委員會的　　，以限制通貨膨脹。這幾項辦法，果能切實辦到，則公衆對於法幣的信用，自可因而提高，投機國續和資金逃避的風氣，亦將自動消散，而國家各種支出，亦不至因物價的步漲，而逐月超過，漫無限制，整個的國民經濟，必將日趨於好轉了。</p>
<p>至於物資太少這一層，運用外援，固不失爲臨時應急的一法，但根本補救，總不能不從增加生產上入手。這需要大衆的共同勞力，與各方面的分頭發展，務使人人有業可就，庶幾大家有飯可吃。所以月前念要之圖，倒不是侈談建設，集巾資力在某種特定事業之上，亦不是裝點門面空談如何提倡保護，而是大刀闊子，先替羣衆解除一切可以就業的障礦，造成一個勉可茍安的生產環境，使商　安於肆，工可安於廠，農可安於田作，更不許大批自食其力　安分良民，以逃稅，逃役，逃廠，乃至逃避賤價勒購之故，致　離失所，悉成爲坐待救濟的難民，而後生產可以增加，物價可以平落。翁院長於立院作　　　時，已承認戶籍不淸，你田長難免擾民，今後決澄演役政，兼採募兵制度，又稱將禁止　實　偕以外之種食捐稅與攤派，其於目前之　實黴借並鄭重聲明，這是　亂時不得已之辦法，當極力求其簡捷確實，以免擾民，可知　閻騷然，民不聊生的種種情形，當局亦未始一無認識。所惜禁網黃細，商民舉足荊棘，與廠家困難重重，欲罷不能之窘狀，他並沒有一言提及。其於掃除障碍，造成勉可茍安的生產環境這一點，他究竟有沒有把握住重心，還有待於事實之證明。然而我們却以爲通貨太多與物資太少道兩種病象，如果不對症發藥，予以根本上之治療，則要求經濟安定，物價安定，恐怕還是緣木求魚。</p>

<p>— 黃紹祖</p>
<p>瓦爾加（E．Varga）一向是蘇聯經濟學界的最高權威嗎，也是整個世界馬克思主義經濟理論的領導人物。他雖則出身是匈牙利人，但早巳取得蘇聯的國籍，並且自蘇聯十月革命以來的二三十年中，一直高據着蘇聯經濟理論的皇座。他的著作很多，且幾乎每一種都是具有代表性和重大意義的。尤其過去幾乎每年發表一篇對於蘇聯經濟以及資本主義世界經濟之總結和預測性的文字，內容不外是一種強烈的對照，宣稱蘇聯的社會主義想濟是如何日趨繁榮和發展，而資本主義世界的經濟又是如何日益混亂和衰落。最動人的，是他每年宜告資本主義經濟已經發展到最後階段，所以立刻就會有世界性的經濟恐慌發生，而導引出資本主義經濟的總崩潰來。這些話雖則每年都說，而每次又都說不中，但其影響還是巨大的。不僅蘇聯當局對它異常的重視和贊勵，將他的觀點盡可能的擴大流傳，同時全世界的左派人士，也將他的一言一語都奉爲金科玉律，作爲各自了解當前經濟現象的寶貴鎖鑰，因此「瓦爾加如何如何說」的這一類引證，是到處可以君見的。總而言之，在同時代的馬克思主義經濟學者中，沒有一個人的地位名望是像他這樣尊貴祟高的。</p>
<p>可是，就正是這位瓦爾加先生，現在却受到蘇聯當局以及蘇聯經濟學界猛烈的批評，並且還加以嚴格的淸算了。突然的從天上被擲到地下，這是什麽緣故呢？推其原因是爲了他現在的觀點，是和過去歷來的預言背道而馳了，他竟然認爲資本主義的世界經濟非但一時不會「崩潰」，並且還有一定的發展前途。這樣「反動」的觀點，就如何能爲蘇聯當局和馬克思主義的「正統」學者所容忍，他自然不可避免的要遭受嚴重打擊了。</p>
<p>瓦爾加事件的實際情況，就是這樣的：在去年秋，瓦爾加根據了自己對於世界經濟現實情況的小心觀察，而寫下了「第二次世界大戰結束以來資本主義經濟的變化」這一本書。在這本書裏，他的基本觀點是這樣幾點：</p>
<p>（一）他認為國家在戰時資本主義各國經濟中，曾經起了決定性的作用，並且資本主義國家也是具有一定的「超階級性」的，即它雖則整個地代表着資產階級的總利益，但却往往個別地是和若資產階級的利益對立着的。他的原詞這樣說：「資產階級國家這裏所代表的，是作爲階級的整個資產階級的利益。它努力想最合宜地利用國家資源，以供戰爭目的之用，結果就經常和個別資本主義企圖的私人利益，及其儘可能汲軍更高額利潤的慾望發生衝突。」他並舉了政府之反對及壓制私人資本家的隨斷或投機行爲做例，來加以說明。同時更認爲：「在戰後，國家的作用將比戰時更為重大。」</p>
<p>（二）進一步他更指出向來認爲資本主義經濟不可能計劃化的觀念是情誤的，是不符事實的。他說：「關於資本主義制度下的計劃化問題，我們也常常受到舊觀念的牽制，總以爲我們有計劃經濟，而在資本主義制度之下，則生產是到處，永遠和毫無差別地受着無政府狀態的控制。我以爲問題不應該這樣提出。」於是接下來，他便承認了：「在某些資本主義國家，出現了類似獨特的一種「國家計劃」的東西。」</p>
<p>（三）他把戰後資本主義世界經濟巾的變化，分成二種—暫時的和長期的。他認爲：暫時的變化，約在最近十年內將決定着資本主義的發展；而長期的變代，乃在各國達到了戰前生產水準之後，即至少十年之後，才能完全顯示出來。在第一階段，他說：「戰時經濟發展的不平衡性，將給予資本主義的經濟發展以決定性的影響。」一直要到第二階段，當戰爭所引起的資本主義的變化完全顯露出來之時，它們才會表現在「資本主義制度的基本矛盾—生產社會化和佔有私人化的予盾的尖銳上，而且首先將表現在市塲的問題上。」這也就是說，在最近十年之內，資本主義的內在矛盾還不會展開和深化起來，因此資本主義還有一個時期的發展前途。可是他在過去曾經一再宣稱資本主義已經發展到它的第三階段亦即最後階段了。</p>
<p>（四）瓦爾加封於東南歐國家的所謂「新民主主義」經濟，估價非常之低，他認爲在那些國家裏，是「國家資本主義雖然佔着優勢。但不能視爲資本主義（在舊的意義上）的新型經濟在這些國家裏出現的，而且它們基本上還不能改變整個資本主義的發展前途。」這也就是說，他認爲資本主義經濟的發展仍是當前歷史的主要內容。</p>
<p>上述理論顯然和他過去的觀點，亦則是正統的馬克思主義的觀點，以及符合蘇聯政策實際要求的觀點，完全相違反的。道就自然會引起蘇聯正統經濟學界的大事抨擊，以及更進一步遭致蘇聯當局來予以無情的淸算了。</p>
<p>特別是負着蘇聯實際最高領導責任的聯共中央政治局，對此尤具反感。因爲以瓦爾加的地位而寫出這樣觀點的畫來，道不論於她對外的冷戰宜傳，或是對內的統治教育，自然有着莫大的不利影響。所以無論如何，不能不對瓦爾加大張撻伐，予以嚴重的打擊，必須將他完全打倒而後已。</p>
<p>具體的佈置就是：一方面策動了所有正統的馬克思主義經濟學家們，紛紛在報章雜誌上發表批評文字，指斥瓦爾加的「錯誤」，他方面則更召集了一個名義上爲「檢討會」實際上則等於是「審判會」的經濟學界大集會，要瓦爾加公開出席答　，成爲衆矢之的，而讓大家來對他駁得「體無完膚」。這還不修，另外就又把他原任蘇聯科學院國際經濟研究院主任的職務撤去，并且還禁止他再公開講學和公開著書，至於那本「第二次世界大戰結束以來資本主義經濟的變化」一書，更不用說被看作大逆不道，而予以禁止流傳的處分了。</p>
<p>在「檢討會」裏，對瓦爾加在本書　所闡發的觀點，自然是進行了無所不用其極的批評，指爲「違反了馬克思主義的理諭」，或是違反了列寗和史達林的「意見」，却很少或甚至不會見有指出它們是違反事實的。因此蘇聯當局以及這批正統馬克思主義經濟學家對於瓦爾加的淸算鬥爭，就正是「教條」對「真理」的鬥爭，「宣傳」對「事實」的門爭。瓦爾加一向服從「教條」，甘心「宣傳」，他所獲得的就只有讚美，沒有責難；只有幸福，沒有災禍。一旦他本着一個理諭工作者最後的一份良知，不願再把白的說成黑的，追隨事實，服膺眞理，則他在一切都得服從黨派性的國家裏自然站不住脚，必然會遭受到致命的打擊，而他的政治生命就此被淸算完結。</p>
<p>但作爲一個具有獨立思想和完整人格的理論工作者，應該是這樣一僩忠於真理忠於事實的勇者。我們看到就是在「檢討會」裏，瓦爾加還是爲自己的觀點侃侃而辯，他不是不愛他的祖國蘇聯，更不會不愛他自己個人，但他更愛眞理，更尊重事實，就自然而然會這樣大無畏地不計成敗不顧險難的做了。對於瓦爾加的這一份精神，是值得我們每一個有良知的人向他致敬的。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕「上海楊妹」張黛琳是否已數年不食，及其目前生活狀態如何，本市各方正靜待答案之漸次展開。據已成爲張女一審父」之社會局專員黃麟書三日來之實地觀察：張女並非絕對不食，而係三日吃香蕉一枚，每口飲開水四杯，此外須抽上好香烟廿支。張女係十六日遷入黃寓，十七日即爲其向例「三日進食」之期，但　因見當日某報載其竹做舞女，大爲不　，憤而將香蕉放棄。昨黃雖再購查　勸其補食，惟渠表示「過期應予作廢」，故三日來餘開水香烟外，確始終未進任何食品。</p>
<p>黃昨已延請李霖醫師爲張作生理上之初步檢查，診察結果：無淋巴腺，子宮位正常，身體各部一無異狀，僅脈膊稍呈微弱。李頗以未能得檢驗張女排洩物之機會爲憾，因十七日張女適逢經期，每日大小便亦有多次，惟均己在抽水馬桶中冲去，故僅憑形態檢查尚不能下　定之斷語。今日起李決偕護士二人，對張女生活作進一步之詳細考察，如數日內能有結論，渠將向本市醫師公會提出，請張女移住一環境幽靜之醫院，由上海全體醫師及生理學家負起研究任務。本市醫藥界對重　同業研究楊妹之狂熱，饗往已久，此次當可籍研究張女之機會，對人類生理作一榮譽發現。</p>
<p>張女昨於午睡四小時後出現記者之前時，幾難以使人濺信渠爲一數年不食之女人。秀髮　　，星眸流　，皮膚白哲，身段苗條裸足，白高跟鞋，紅花麻布旗袍，步伐輕快，對人曼聲低語，彬彬有禮。尤以渠全身肌理停勻，乳部高聳，根據肌肉必藉蛋白質營養長成之醫學原理，李醫師對其不食之說亦表示在常識上無法解釋。</p>
<p>惟渠亦有兩點與常人稍異：感覺特別敏銳，記憶能力模糊。渠常嫌茶杯有惱人之　氣，故黃麟書特爲其購置新杯一只。渠亦常於談笑風生之際，突然蹙眉作色，振衣離席，故無人能理解其　怒哀樂之感情　化，何以如此急　突兀，旁若無人。渠自言來滬已三四年，又謂已十餘年，稱不食遠在十六歲時，又云在十二歲時，惟　有定其年齡爲廿一歲，但無人能相信此即爲其最　實之年齡。</p>
<p>因張女神經頗似失常，故關於渠之身世担從　　。據渠自稱，係天津人，父母早故，其夫張鵬飛（即張天翼），抗戰時在廣德工作，勝利後被派赴天津接收津浦鐵路段務，兩人即在此時由戀愛而結合。張鵬飛現任港務委員會警衛督察，因上海覓屋不易，故迄未定居。張女現頗希望生育，藉慰寂廖。據李醫師觀察，渠喜接近孩童，愛好化裝，證明其尚有性慾存在，且月經猶三月一至，故生育並非絕不可能。</p>
<p>自談絕食原因　由於後母虐待</p>
<p>張女智慧，與常人絲毫無異，尤爲缺乏不食之　象。渠每日披　報紙，理解力甚高，能歌唱，善跳舞，國語之外能操流利滬語。前晚並赴民光戲院觀　俠盜平番」電影惟觀後在表情上無任何反饗。渠自稱幼年因受後母虐待，故發憤絕食。遷入黃寓後，見他人進食，則掩面而過，爲狀似頗厭惡。有人吿以不食後吳將異當嚴重，渠則慨謂：「至多一死而己」，言下更充滿無限感傷。渠見黃麟書夫婦即高呼寄父母，至爲溫婉，又頗似亟需慈祥之愛。據此兩點推測，張女神經稍有失態，或由於早年刺激過深所致。惟樣張女以前住處之女傭稱：最近渠之後母曾有函致女，　將對渠經濟上有所接濟，則渠與其後母間之感情，又似並未陷於破裂。</p>
<p>佛又信基督　舉止令人費解</p>
<p>自楊妹不食消息傳出後，張女即竊笑世人何竟少見多怪？月　各方評論不食決不可能者時吐斥責之詞，因而渠不食之事終以揭露。渠表示自幼即持戒奉佛，近更虔信基督，但果強令其讀經參禮，則又不感興趣。渠昨曾因黃母臥恙入室探病，而摒絕他人同時進內，嗣黃在鑰匙孔中竊窺，見渠正以鉛　疾書紙上，如鈎符　，　　紙在壁問觀音像上環續數　，並飲水一口，噴吐似道壇作法，最後爲黃母遍體　準，緊張有力，厥狀尤令人費解。</p>
<p>張女　美觀　極強，渠因面頰左右略有大小，故常以秀　　額，籍保持　部平衡。渠日前亦曾赴理髪店燙髮。李醫師對此指爲不可想像，因燙髮　頭部溫度極高，且亞摩尼亞藥水氣味　，決非一不食數年神經失常之人所能忍受。張女愛潔如命，衣着一有油　，即拋棄不顧。每日早晨六時起身，寒　不更。居常自言。除腹部陷門特甚外，並不　其內心及生理有何異狀，並　對人謂不食有何特殊之處？值得大家如此驚奇！</p>

<p>自限制支票抵用之後，行莊現鈔收付激增，本票開發頻繁，重以時問人力有限，行莊與客戶問常政爭先恐後，顧此失彼。上海金融管理局有鑒及此，爲求改進　減少掉換本票起見，前飭本市銀錢信託三業公會就行莊本身實際情形，並　顧工廠業之便利，擬具客戶託收各項即期票據之抵用辦法，金管局已核准即日試辦。茲錄此項辦法於下：</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕食米昨日有價無貨，政府仍嚴格執行限價，昨未拋售，塲外雖有喊價，每石一千零五六十萬元者，但未成交。南北市塲到貨稀少，南市塲僅到有無秈，每石九百六十五萬元，其餘則爲白元陰元，白粳絕跡。南市塲到米一四二〇石，北市塲到米一八四二石，共到三二六二石。到貨稀少原因，由於產區價格較本市爲高，商人蓮米來滬無利可圖。</p>
<p>綜觀昨日米市，表面似未超出限價，惟執貨者待機觀變，不肯賤價脫手，以致無貨應市，造成外弛內緊之局。惟昨日夜報曾有米價每石漲達一千二百萬元之說，據社會局糧食科長吉明齋表示，絕對不確。至首批美援食米抵滬，對市塲米價無若何重要影饗，因該項食米係配售戶口，而不到市塲，但對於安定人心，則有其相當作用。</p>

<p>— 鄧廣銘</p>
<p>感皇恩</p>
<p>壽范倅</p>
<p>七市古來稀，人人都道：不是陰功怎生到。松姿雖　，偏耐雪寒霜　．看君雙鬢底，靑春好。</p>
<p>樓雪初晴，庭　嬉笑。一醉何妨玉壺倒？從今康　，不用靈丹仙草。要看一百歲，人難老。</p>
<p>又</p>
<p>滁州壽范倅</p>
<p>春事到淸明，十分花柳。喚得笙歌勸君酒。酒如春好，春色年年依舊。靑春元不老，君知否？</p>
<p>席上看君，竹淸松瘦。待與靑春關長久。三山歸路，明日天香襟袖。更持金盞起，爲君壽。</p>
<p>以上兩詞，均是爲了祝范伴之壽而作。前一首未註明作於何地，後一首作於職州，當在稼軒任溆州知州期內。范倅的名號，詞題中均未標明。今案「倅」爲通判的簡稱，依稼軒的事歷推考，在他早年的親友或同僚當中，姓范而作通判的，至少可找到兩個人：一個是范昂，於宋孝宗乾道六年（一一七〇）至八年（一一七二）權通判溆州，見溆州府志的通判門知宋會要稿職官門的司勳部。另一個是稼軒的岳丈范邦彥，是宋高宗紹興三十一年（一一六一）由金南歸於宋的人。至順鎮江志的人物志說：</p>
<p>「范邦彥，字干美，邢州唐山人。宣和間太學生·靖康末，邢州破，入金。舉於鄉，仕蔡州新息令。紹興中率衆開蔡州以迎宋師，遂南從于潤。授湖州簽判，陞通州，卒于官，年七十四。」</p>
<p>牟嘛的陵陽集中有「書范雷卿家　」一文，其中有述及范邦彥的一段：</p>
<p>「范君雷卿，……四世祖號河朔孟嘗。靖康之亂能全其示，收窮周急，信義具著。　進士出身，爲蔡州之新息縣。紹興辛已十月　其縣來歸。……法當超授以勸，乃僅添差湖州長興丞，緋衣銀魚，不盡如章？……改簽書鎮江軍節度使判官應事，召赴都堂審察，添差通判本府，以壽終于官。……公與　公棄疾先後來歸，忠義相知，辛公遂婿于公。公當審時，陳公俊卿，王公炎皆知公，而公老矣，不果用，責志以後。……鳴呼，公之不遇命也。」</p>
<p>這兩段記載中所述范邦彥晚年任簽判和通判的地點雖不相同，說范氏確曾做通過判而且死於通判任上，却是兩書所同然的。如就二說加以抉擇，我以爲應從牟　之說，因爲他是有范氏的家譜作依據的。</p>
<p>稼軒這兩首感皇恩詞題中的范倅，是范邦彥呢？是范勗呢？　是前一首的范倅爲邦彥而滁州視　的范倅爲范昂呢？</p>
<p>就兩詞中所描述的景物說，一首是　於「樓雪初睛」之日，另一首則是作於「十分花柳」的淸明時節，時令似不符同。因而，在最初，我認爲這兩首詞中的范　必不指同一個人，生於淸明前後者，是范昂（因爲這首詞是作于滁州的），生於「樓　初晴」之日者必爲范邦彥。從　撰稼　年譜之日起，到寫成「稼軒交遊考一之日止，我一直是　樣的意見，近來翻閱舊作，却覺得這意見應該加以修正，這兩首感皇恩，必全是爲范邦彥而作的。理由是：</p>
<p>第一，兩詞之一有「席上看君，竹淸松瘦」句，另一則有「松姿雖瘦」句，若這兩詞中的范伴不是一人，則絕不會兩個人都恰巧生得一副淸瘦的身材。</p>
<p>第二，范邦彥於歸宋之後，寓居鎮江，而「滁州壽范倅」的一首中有「三山歸路」句，正即指鎮江的金山焦山和北固山而言。任滁州倅的范勗斷不會也恰巧是家居鎮江的人。</p>
<p>第三，南宋時候的冬至，均在西曆十二月十四五日，依此推算，淸明節當在中曆的二三月內。假如一個人生在二月末或三月初，在某一年爲他視壽時可能是淸明時節已過，而在另一年內却又可能淸明還未到來。而且在「十分花柳」的淸明之後，江淮一帶有時也仍可飛雪，例如乾道四年的淸明應在二月十七日，而宋史五行志一下却載是年二月二十日癸丑大學，雖未指明地點，當即南宋腹地江浙一帶。所以，在這兩首感皇恩詞中所描述的景物儘管稍異，我們斷定其爲同是壽范邦彥之作，却是可以講得通的</p>
<p>牟　的文章中說到范邦彥晚年「召赴都堂審察」時，頗得陳俊卿和王炎的賞識。宋代通列，凡召赴都堂受審的人，都由宰相或參知政事負責審察，旣說范邦　因受審而受知於陳俊　和王炎，　也等於說范氏受審時正是陳王二人任宰　之日。據徐自明的宋宰輔　年錄，陳俊卿於乾道三年十一月除參知政事，四年十月除左正議大夫，右僕射，同平章事，六年五月罷相，出知福州。王炎於乾道四年二月除端明殿學士，簽書樞密院事，兼權參知政事，五年二月除參知政事兼同知國用事，三月以左中大夫出爲四川宣撫使，依舊參知政事。籍知陳王二人之分任宰執，共居朝堂，乃是乾道四年二月至五年三月間事。是則范氏之被召受審，至晚當在乾道五年春間。受審後添差通判鎮江，未及受代而終於任所，則范氏之卒至晚也當在乾道九年之前·南宋用　正人作添差通判，大都是明令規定「不　務」（即不治事）的。唯其不發務，故可離任所而遠遊。大約那時稼軒巳經締烟於范氏，故范氏於乾道八年稼軒守　之初即相隨至　。因其到　只爲遊覽並無官守，隨時可以返任，故稼軒於祝壽詞中即有「三山　路，明日天香　袖」之句。事實上范氏在溆州却是停留了很久方才離開，於時稼軒又賦「木蘭花慢」相送，中有「屈指中秋，十分好月，不照人圓」之句，知爲時已是秋初了</p>
<p>依據上面的推斷，范氏之死旣必在乾道九年之前，則必是由溆州歸鎮江後不久的事，若非秋季，便在冬間。其時范氏爲七十四歲，「七十古來稀」一首若作於范氏七十歲的一年，便應是乾道四年的春季，要算稼軒詞巾寫作年份可考的最早的一首了。（三十七年六月十日寫於北平北大公舍）</p>

<p>— 周祖謨</p>
<p>淸代通聲韻之學，且以等韻名家者，有二人，曰江永，曰陳澧。江氏之音學辨微，四聲切韻表，陳氏之切韻考外篇，晉言等韻者也。惟江氏墨守宋人字母之說，而不能明其得失；陳氏能明其得失，而不能與韻書參合融貫；皆其短也。然二人之成就，固已卓犖可觀，今鄒氏此書又遠不逮二氏之淹通　博矣。其中忸於方音，不考本末，迷亂古今之諭至多。</p>
<p>書分上下二卷，上卷論五音，二十音；下卷論八呼，十五類。其論五音也，與四聲混爲一事。遂謂「五音者，陰陽上去入也。險陽爲商角，去入爲徽羽，上爲宮。漢書日：聲上宮，宮是尊上，而綱維四聲，故能自下上上，而曰上也」（見諭四聲本具五音條）。此與北齊李季節音韻決疑以「宮商爲平，徽爲上，羽爲去，角爲入」（見文鏡秘府論劉善經四聲論引），強以古人律呂之名與語音之四聲相配，同爲不根之談。夫古人字有聲調之分，而無平上去入之名，故以宮商角徽羽五音稱之，本屬借用，陳蘭甫切韻考已言之，不可強爲牽合。而鄒員復變亂隋唐以來之舊說，穿　附會，則別生歧誤矣。案五音四聲本爲二事，昔沈約答魏定州刺史甄思伯書固嘗言之。其言日：</p>
<p>經典史籍惟有五聲，而無四聲，然則四聲之用，何傷五聲也？五聲者，宮商角徽羽，上下相應，則樂聲和矣，君臣民事物五者相得，則國家治矣。作五言詩者，善用四聲，則諷詠而流靡，能達八體，則陸離而華潔。各有所施，不相妨廢。（亦見四聲諭引）</p>
<p>此誠爲達言·且字音之分陰陽，古無是說。陰陽之爲字調之名，乃元人曲韻家所創。蓋字音之聲紐舊有請濁之分，後世方音中聲母或不分淸濁，而聲調有陰陽之異。陰陽與淸濁本爲二事。陰陽之義，亦本無所指。凡字之聲紐爲淸聲者，其所讀之音調，即謂之險調；　紐爲濁聲者，其所搜之音　，即謂之陽　。平聲如是，上去入亦然。惟方言中上去入或有不分陰陽者，然非　　如此·今鄒氏以平聲之陰陽與商角相配，則上去之陰陽復將何如？且以其新化方音上去無陰陽之分，遂文請上去無　音，此所謂　習方音，不考本末之論也。</p>
<p>至於二十音之目，乃鄒氏刪併字母之說。彼以爲宋人字母重出者多，因併曉於匣，併羣於溪，併定於透，併泥於來，併喻於影，併知於照，併徹澄床於穿，併娘日禪於審，鎮從於淸，併邪於心，併並於滂，併奉於敷，三十六母併其十六，故爲二十。然此皆鄒氏一己之方音，奚可持此以議古人！至謂古音審羣當鎮併於曉，邪當併於許，許疑二母古又當讀輕　，則尤爲悠謬不經矣·若乃論及　舌牙齒喉五聲，則謂牙本無聲，其聲即喉舌齒　諸聲，前人所言五聲中，所以有牙聲者，乃總括之名，非主一官也。此蓋又爲廣韻末辯字五音法及在篇末五音聲論所誤。辯字五音法以迦　爲牙聲，網名爲喉聲。迦爲見母，綱各亦爲見母，五音聲論以何我剛鍔　可康各爲喉聲，更硬牙格行幸亨客爲牙聲。其中何爲匣母，行幸亦爲匣母；我鄂爲疑母，硬牙亦爲疑母；剛調各爲見母，更格亦爲見母；康爲溪母，客亦爲溪母。是牙喉二聲，似無界畔可尋，故鄒氏逐請牙聲爲空名。若細分之，玉篇五音聲諭，喉聲中爲一等字，牙爲二等字，其讀音之前後似當有別，實非一類也。</p>
<p>抑又考之，瘠舌牙齒喉之為五昔，乃出自梵文悉曇章。梵文之體文，大別分爲兩類。一日毘。聲，二曰超聲。毘。聲者，五五相比故名，皆氣呼觸口，由口部器官加以節制所發之輔音，超聲者，亦稱和會聲，即半元音及摩擦音之類。以其音發自喉，遍滿口中，故又名遍口聲。毘聲依口部發昔地位之不同，而分爲五類，即所謂五聲是也。其第一類為古根音k，k　，g，g　ng，即中土見溪羣疑一類音。此類音梵文文法家之命名亦不一致，Pratiakbyas謂之舌根聲，或譯爲舌本聲；或牙聲；Panini則謂之爲喉聲，或譯爲喉中聲。然自六朝以迄隋唐之世，梵僧之來中土者，或爲中天竺人，或爲南天竺人，其語音互有不同，喉牙本爲一類，而方言中之讀法，則或爲喉音，或爲牙音。是以中土之傳習悉曇者派別亦異。五聲之名，家自爲說。（未完）</p>
<h3 id="c138">關於石鼓文「」字問題　致文史編者的一封公開信 <a href="#c138" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e138" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">138</a></h3>
<p>— 唐蘭</p>
<p>編者先生：</p>
<p>關於石鼓文「遊」字的問題，今天又接到上海市博物館寄來文物第八十五期，有童書業先生的「論石鼓文的用字三質唐蘭先生」一文，我讀了一過，深深地感覺到，如其兩個人的思想和所用的方法不一樣，是不能在一起來討論一個問題的。例如我最近只提出石鼓文有　沒朕的一點，只是作「石鼓決不在竟公前，要放在景公後，詛楚文前」，這樣一個說法的根據。先把這一側說法確定了是，或者不是，然後再說別的。說別的時，自然還要別的　據。我和童先生討論，總想集中在一個先決的問題，而不去東牽西扯。　種討諭，應當「斬釘截鐵」，只限在一個論點，而不擴展開去，這是我的討諭方法。現在童先生說我根據這一點來確定它是秦靈公三年所刻，便和我的方法不合。　字和秦靈公有什麽關聯，我能把它們一下就勾聯起來呢？童先生還沒有明了我的討諭的方法，那就沒有共同的出發了。</p>
<p>又如童先生引吉日劍的「朕余」，沈子　的「朕吾」，姑不論吉日　的時代和沈子　的「吾」字是否可信，單是「朕余」跟「朕吾」，在我的方法裏，就不敢隨便用來代替「朕」或者「吾」，它們的性質，在沒有詳細研究時，不知爲不知，是我的方法</p>
<p>者　鐘據我　知，　應讀凍，不是洞字。這是越王勾踐的太子適郢，越世家作　與，越絕書記地作與夷，（，越春秋與誤爲興）。十九年是勾踐十九年，在獲麟後。郭沬若先生認爲諸咎，是錯的，我們所見　咎粵滑的銅器狠多，者　鐘無疑地在他們之前。那裏有朕字，和我說朕字消失跟吾字流行在春秋戰國之際，時問並不矛盾，雖然地域不同的　越文化也許可以是較爲保守的。不過，獲麟後就可算戰國，童先生也許還可以說戰國也有朕字，而說我的「春秋戰國之際」的說法是「無根之談」的。</p>
<p>主要的問題，是在時問和地域。齊侯　有「朕」沒有「　」，　　有「虛」沒「朕」，地域是相同的，所以我認爲時間不同，齊侯　在前，　　在後。在寨糸文字裏，我說有「朕」字的寨公　在前，有「避」字的石鼓在後，這是同樣的論證。假使我把秦糸的時代斷錯了，齊糸的也一定是錯的，因爲，我的方法是一致的。對於某一點的看法，我們容或可以弄錯，假如錯了，我狠願　承認，只有方法是錯不得的</p>
<p>但是童先生呢？他說有鼓在春秋早期，當然遠在秦最公的泰公　前。而在　　則說和齊景公時的齊侯　「差得不遠」，這是一句含混的話，是差在前的？差在後呢？他說時代無　斷定，可又根據齊侯　的縣，　　的邑，說制度相近，因之他又起了一個疑問，「是不是齊國人的用字，在這時期中起了突變呢？」由此我們可以知道，童先生也知道這個「差」是「差在後」，他只是在避免說出這個「後」字。也許我的想法不對，我總覺得在這種重要關頭，最低限度要把是非弄淸楚，不匯該用「遁辭」。旣然覺得是在後，就痛痛快快的在後，何必說什麼「差得不遠」。我們所要決定的只是前後，是「　」字在前呢？還是「朕」字在前呢？這是一個重要的分界。遠不遠，在此是另外一件事，短期中有沒有突變也是另外一件事，一切理論，先收起來，請來歷史的事實，假使事實上是突變了，我們能說時間太短不許突變嗎？</p>
<p>總之，根據童光生的說法，石鼓用「過」字遠在用「朕」字的秦公甚之前，而和秦景公同時的齊靈公時代的齊侯　用「朕」字，却顛倒轉來，在用「　」字的　　前。在我的方法裏，這是矛盾的，絕對不能容許的。</p>
<p>誠如童先生所討，詩經用「朕」字很少，這或者可以證明西周末年以後，「朕」字在活語言裏已漸漸失勢，而鐘鼎文是較保守的，所以在春秋時還在用。可是在同一地域內的「朕」和「盧　取「吾」，總有一個先後之別吧？到　「朕」在前呢？「吾」「　」在前呢？我所願意討諭的只是這一點。　先生居然承認「朕」字自然比較古，這是我們一百分之一百可以同意的了，但是他依舊要說石鼓文用「　」字一定在東周初期，比用「朕」字的秦公　早得多，這又是我們不懂得的。</p>
<p>詩經用「我」「余」而不用「朕」跟「吾」，童先生以爲「朕」是古語，但是石鼓用「　」「我」「余」而不用「朕」，却又是「沒有用朕的必要」。道樣前後矛盾的說法，不知童先生是怎麼想來的？童先生吿訴我們詩經國風不用「朕」字，不能說是戰國作品，所以石鼓文不用「朕」字也不能說是戰國。但是一吾」字呢？詩經有「我」字，沒有「吾」字，石鼓有「　」字，也有「我」字，而且把「我車旣攻」，改爲「「　」車旣工」究竟是「吾」比「朔」還古，石鼓還在國風之前呢？還是「吾」字比「我」「余」兩字都新，發生在國風之後呢？</p>
<p>俗語說：「事不過三」，我已竟兩次討論這個問題，這是第三次了。再答覆也不過是這些話，除了信口開河，總離不了我那套老方法。多說廢話，徒然佔了您實貴的篇幅。真實的事情總有一天會被證明的，現在，旣然思路不同，方法各異，再討論下去，只有「後息者爲勝」，不會有一個結論的。我雖怕人家誤解了我的本意却也狠怕我誤會了別人的意思，又狠希望童先生能慢慢地自圓其說，所以決計就此打住，借此聲明一下，以後不再討論了。</p>
<p>最後，謝謝您幾次刊布這些廢話的盛意·</p>

<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 18th] The 13th meeting of the first session of the Legislative Yuan was held on the 18th, presided over by President Sun. In the morning session, in addition to passing reports and observing a moment of silence for the passing of Hunan legislator Xia Kaiquan, the order of proceedings was determined, prioritizing the discussion of legal and financial matters to avoid delaying the meeting with advisory items. The handling of various cases throughout the day is recorded as follows: (1) Fu Jingyan and others proposed expediting the implementation of currency system reform. (2) Gu Hezhen and others proposed requesting the government to establish a legal tender issuance management committee within a limited time to curb inflation. It was resolved to refer both to the Finance Committee for review. (3) Li Xiufen and others proposed requesting the government to utilize the financial institutions of Guangdong and Fujian provinces to issue local currency, establish appropriate exchange rates, assist legal tender, eliminate the black market, and prevent the evasion of overseas remittances. It was resolved to refer it to the Finance Committee to be jointly reviewed with the Overseas Chinese Affairs Committee. (4) The Legal Committee reported on the review of the proposal by Tian Yushi and others to amend Article 19 of the Legislative Yuan's Organizational Law. It was resolved to pass it according to the draft article in the review report.

(9) Zhang Zhijiang and others proposed establishing a special committee for price review, and (10) Feng Jinping and others proposed twelve measures to stabilize prices, requesting a public vote.

<h3 id="e2">Legislators Criticize Soaring Prices; See it as a Challenge to the Government; Hope to Break Free from Face-Saving to Effectively Stop It <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 10th] During the Legislative Yuan's meeting on the afternoon of the 18th to discuss the proposal to stabilize prices, the proposer, Zhang Zhijiang, first explained that prices are rising, and ordinary people work hard all day but cannot get enough to eat. The government's competent authorities talk about suppressing prices every day, but there is no effective solution. He pointed out that unscrupulous merchants are hoarding and speculating, bureaucratic capital is playing a role, product sources are decreasing, and supply is falling short of demand. If the government does not have the greatest determination to break free from face-saving and suppress prices, it will not be enough to relieve the people's suffering. Feng Jinping explained that soaring prices are not only a challenge to the Executive Yuan but also a challenge to the Legislative Yuan. The Legislative Yuan should be responsible for quickly devising effective measures to stop it. Yu Dezhen expressed his agreement, but did not advocate setting up another special committee. Liu Wendao criticized that the high prices are related to the malpractices of industrial loans, agricultural loans, and commercial loans. Miao Qiping said: If the government cannot stabilize prices, how can it talk about pacifying the world? Some people also pointed out that the main reason for the price increase is the manipulation by the four banks and two bureaus. Their financial measures have not been submitted to the audit department for review. If they are not feeling guilty, why would they evade it? Yang Bu and others also expressed their support for this proposal, which was resolved to be referred to the special committee for reviewing the gains and losses of national governance since the victory for review.</p>

<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 18th] During the Legislative Yuan's meeting on the 18th, there were three groups of petitioners from people's organizations: (1) The Shanghai Real Estate Industry Association requested the abolition of the Housing Lease Regulations. (2) The Fellowship Association of Translators Who Passed the Publicly Funded Overseas Student Examination requested the transfer of a petition to the Executive Yuan, urging the government to fulfill its promise and promptly find a way to send them abroad. (3) The National Federation of Grain Business Associations requested the amendment of the temporary income tax regulations and business tax law for grain merchants, exemption from grain business tax, abolishment of the restrictions on the transit of grain from the south to the north, and requested the government to quickly devise countermeasures against rice robbery incidents in various places. Members were dispatched to meet with each group, and their petitions were referred to the relevant committees for review.

The Ministry has also telegraphed the Executive Yuan to quickly order the Central Bank to lend 150 billion yuan to the factory to facilitate the distribution expenses. Furthermore, the Ministry of Economic Affairs was previously ordered to be reorganized into the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, but since the new minister has not yet taken office, all internal administrative affairs and affiliated businesses are continuing to be handled.

<p>[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 17th] Mr. Sebald, acting political advisor to General MacArthur, said on the 17th when commenting on Premier Weng's statement on Japanese policy: The United States is also as anxious as China to prevent Japan from rearming. However, to prevent the possibility of communism, Japan must have some kind of guard force to maintain security, and it must also restore trade and some industry to achieve economic self-sufficiency.

(2) In the Machigou area of ​​Fugu, the poppy flowers are blooming. To cover up the opium harvest, the communist bandits sent Wang Yuefeng's 300-man cavalry north to invade the Yimeng area along the river, sneaking to Xinminbao near the opposite bank of Baotou. Liu Wanchun, stationed in Baotou, sent troops across the river to suppress them. Today, they are retreating to the southeast. Small groups of cavalry bandits were discovered on the opposite bank of Saratsi County. (3) There are currently more than 20 small-scale arsenals in Chahar and Suiyuan, manufacturing weapons for people's self-defense. Each month, they can produce 4,000 rifles to equip the Hebei Army.</p>

<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 18th] Ministry of Economic Affairs reports: Previously, companies and private banks were found to be privately engaging in banking business. The Ministry, together with the Ministry of Finance, sent a telegram to all provincial and municipal governments to strictly ban this practice. Violators should be ordered to cease operations and be subject to fines. However, there was no uniform regulation as to whether companies and merchants violating the above-mentioned prohibition should be ordered to cease operations entirely or only the department engaged in banking business. Now, after consultation between the Ministry and the Ministry of Finance, it has been decided that in the future, if such cases are discovered, except for manufacturers that are indeed engaged in agricultural, industrial, or mining production or public transportation, they should be fined and ordered to cease operations of the department engaged in banking business to show a balance of interests. Other companies and merchants privately engaging in banking business, regardless of industry or scale, should be fined and ordered to cease operations entirely. The penalty of partial or complete cessation of operations must first be reported by the local competent authorities to the Ministry of Finance for consultation with the Ministry of Economic Affairs before being approved and enforced. The instructions have been jointly distributed to all provincial and municipal governments, and the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Economic Affairs have separately ordered local guilds of money shops, financial management bureaus, provincial construction departments, and industrial and commercial associations to pay attention to reporting violations.</p>
<h3 id="e14">The Control Yuan's Plenary Review Meeting Passes the Control Yuan Law Draft; Amendments to the Exercise of Consent Rights Also Passed; to be Submitted to the Fifth Yuan Meeting for Discussion Today <a href="#e14" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c14" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">14</a></h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 18th] The fifth meeting of the first Control Yuan under the Constitution will be held on the 19th to discuss the Control Law and the draft measures for the exercise of consent rights. In addition, the draft organizational laws of various committees and the organizational cases of the supervisory commissioner's offices will be discussed by the drafting committee before being submitted to the plenary meeting for discussion.</p>
<p>The Control Law draft and the draft measures for the Control Yuan's exercise of consent rights were amended and passed by the plenary review committee held all day on the 18th.</p>
<p>Contents of the Control Law</p>
<p>The Control Law has six chapters. The general principles and rectification chapters were passed in the morning, and the impeachment, censure, investigation, and supplementary provisions were passed in the afternoon. Among them, the impeachment chapter was discussed for a longer time and underwent more amendments. At the same time, strict deadlines were set for the handling of cases. The chapter stipulates that after the examination and decision by nine or more control commissioners other than the proposing commissioner, the Control Yuan should immediately transfer the impeached person for disciplinary action. The examination of the impeachment case should be carried out by all control commissioners in turn. If, after examination, it is deemed that it should not be transferred for disciplinary action, and the proposing commissioner has objections, the impeachment case should be referred to another committee for examination as the final decision. All these provisions are intended to avoid the arbitrary decisions of a few commissioners and easy decisions. After today's discussion, a new clause was added at the end of the chapter: "The impeached personnel shall not be promoted during the disciplinary proceedings." This comes from past experience, where the corruption and illegal activities of a person, once exposed, would be transferred to another position, making it impossible to pursue the matter.</p>
<p>Contents of Consent Rights</p>
<p>The draft measures for the exercise of consent rights have a total of ten articles. The procedure stipulated therein is that the Control Yuan's exercise of consent rights should be examined by the plenary committee and then submitted to the Control Yuan meeting for voting. The plenary committee should examine the resumes and certificates attached to the persons nominated by the President. The committee shall elect one of its members as chairman, and its meetings shall be held in secret. Most members believe that whether or not the Control Yuan agrees to the President's nomination is an unknown matter, but if it is not examined in advance, it would undermine the President's prestige and be detrimental to the nominee if the nominee is rejected. Therefore, it is held in secret; the holding of secret meetings is only to prevent eavesdropping by journalists, which is very different from the open debate in the Legislative Yuan.</p>

<p>[News from this newspaper] Zhang Qun, Wu Tiecheng, and Lei Zhen invited the Young China Party representatives Zuo Shunsheng, Chen Qitian, Li Huang, and Yu Fuxian to Wanglu at 10:00 a.m. yesterday to discuss. Zhang Qun gave a speech, emphasizing the President's sincere hope for cooperation between the three parties, and hoping that the Young China Party will understand the Kuomintang's difficulties in the issue of legislators. He also said that the Young China Party originally had eight elected legislators, and now the Kuomintang can give up five seats. In the future, with persuasion, there may be five more, for a total of ten seats. In other words, the number of legislators of the Young China Party can be increased to eighteen, and it is hoped that the Young China Party can accept this number and participate in the government as soon as possible. The two sides discussed until noon, but the Young China Party did not give a definite answer, but agreed to convene an internal standing committee at 4:00 p.m. to make a decision. This meeting started at 4:00 p.m. and did not end until about 8:00 p.m. After the meeting, discussions continued at Zuo's residence. The contents were kept strictly confidential. It is only known that the party will submit a concrete reply to Zhang Qun on the issue of legislators today.</p>
<p>[News from this newspaper] According to reliable sources: The participation of the Democratic Socialist Party and the Young China Party in the Judicial Yuan and the Examination Yuan has become easier with the arrival of Zhang Qun and Wu Tiecheng in Shanghai. The government has invited Shi Zhiquan, a member of the Democratic Socialist Party, to serve as the Vice President of the Judicial Yuan. Zhang Jun has expressed his agreement on this matter, but it still needs to solicit Shi's opinion. For the position of Vice President of the Examination Yuan, the government intends to invite He Luzhi of the Young China Party to serve, but the candidate still needs to be approved by the Central Standing Committee of the party. The work supervised by both the Judicial Yuan and the Examination Yuan takes impartiality as the basic condition. Therefore, the party members who participate in the two Yuans will no longer bear the actual responsibility within the party.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Shanghai] The person in charge of the Young China Party said that the issue of legislators is difficult to resolve unless there is a new plan. Although the party is willing to understand the government's difficulties, it believes that there are too many difficulties, so it decided to maintain its original position and not participate in the Executive Yuan, the Judicial Yuan, and the Examination Yuan. This decision was immediately notified to Mr. Lei Zhen.</p>

<h3 id="e30">The Necessity and Path to Economic Stability <a href="#e30" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c30" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">30</a></h3>
<p>Strengthening suppression of disorder and stabilizing the economy are the two major focuses of the new Executive Yuan's policy. However, in the past ten days, the wave of price increases has been particularly intense. The Legislative Yuan, the Supervisory Yuan, and other parties are especially concerned about emergency economic measures.</p>
<p>Premier Weng has announced his price policy twice in the Legislative Yuan. He will continue to implement past methods, such as selling off materials, tightening issuance, using American aid materials, issuing treasury bonds, and issuing shares of state-owned enterprises. At the same time, he will use sufficient supply and universal distribution as countermeasures to suppress prices. Of course, it cannot be said that he is wrong. However, apart from the issuance of shares of state-owned enterprises, which has not yet materialized, prices in various places have been fluctuating, with more increases than decreases. The extent of the increases is continuing to grow, almost without limit. It is clear that simply repeating these old tunes cannot serve as genuine emergency measures, nor can it achieve the goal of economic stability.</p>
<p>There are naturally many reasons for soaring prices. However, to summarize, they are nothing more than two major factors: too much currency and too little material. This is something that no one can deny. Regarding the former, at a time when military expenditures are huge and national revenues and expenditures cannot be balanced, it seems that increasing currency issuance has become a matter of course. The responsible authorities have repeatedly publicly declared that this is an unavoidable emergency measure. But whether this statement is entirely reliable and whether there are other remedial measures seems worth further study.</p>
<p>According to the recent budget for the second half of the year compiled by the Ministry of Finance, the total revenue is over 540 trillion yuan. The expenditure budget is still being prepared. It is said that the amount still exceeds the total revenue estimate. Roughly speaking, ordinary revenues and expenditures are expected to balance, but special expenditures must be addressed separately. The fact that they must be addressed separately means that one cannot but rely on increasing the issuance of banknotes to make up for the deficit. Before a formal announcement, it is impossible to make an accurate estimate. However, the items and total amount of revenue that can be increased currently are not small. Minister of Finance Wang announced four methods: (1) increasing tax sources and rectifying tax revenue; (2) utilizing American aid; (3) selling relief materials; (4) selling enemy and puppet materials. In addition, there are surplus materials, indemnity materials, confiscated property of traitors, and the cash portion obtained from the sale of American aid materials. In total, the amount should be quite considerable. Even 300 million US dollars, spent over 12 months, at 25 million US dollars per month, someone estimated, can be used to offset 50 trillion yuan in legal tender. In that case, the current deficit, even if, as Minister of Finance Wang stated, May's revenue was 15 trillion yuan and expenditures were 75 trillion yuan, a difference of as much as 60 trillion yuan, five-sixths of it can easily be made up for by this. Moreover, the issuance of shares of state-owned enterprises, as part of the legal tender reserve, is generally recognized as being under the management of currency. In fact, its benefits and amount are not of great significance. It is better to convert it into cash to offset government spending, which is more practical and effective. If this is done, the revenue and expenditure shortfall for the second half of this year is not absolutely without a solution. If it can be filled, then, whether entirely or partially, the degree of reliance on increasing banknote issuance will necessarily decrease or become unnecessary, and the trend of currency inflation can therefore be stopped or slowed down. Therefore, the most urgent measures at present should be: (1) speedily formulating methods and figures that can fill the gap; (2) fulfilling the promise of reducing government expenditures, and abolishing and reducing all overlapping agencies and redundant personnel, as well as unnecessary or non-urgent project expenses, within a set time limit; (3) announcing the accurate figures for currency issuance on a regular basis, as well as the actual situation for when issuance can be stopped or reduced. If the Legislative Yuan's proposal to establish a Legal Tender Issuance Management Committee to limit currency inflation can be carried out, public confidence in legal tender will naturally increase, and the trend of speculative national debt and capital flight will automatically disappear. Moreover, the nation's various expenditures will not increase month by month due to rising prices, without limit. The entire national economy will necessarily improve day by day.</p>
<p>As for the lack of materials, utilizing foreign aid is indeed a temporary emergency method, but the fundamental remedy cannot but start with increasing production. This requires the joint labor of the masses and the separate development of all parties, so that everyone has a job and everyone has food to eat. Therefore, the most important plan a month ago was not to lavishly discuss construction, concentrating funds on a specific industry, nor was it to decorate the façade with empty talk on how to promote protection, but rather to boldly remove all obstacles that prevent the masses from finding employment, creating a production environment where they can barely make a living, so that merchants can be at ease in the market, workers can be at ease in the factory, and farmers can be at ease in the fields. Moreover, it is not permissible for large numbers of self-sufficient, law-abiding citizens to become displaced and become refugees waiting for relief due to tax evasion, draft evasion, factory evasion, and even evasion of forced purchases at low prices. Only then can production increase and prices fall. When Premier Weng made a statement in the Legislative Yuan, he admitted that household registration was unclear and that village chiefs inevitably disturbed the people. He decided to clarify the military service and adopt a conscription system, and also said that he would prohibit all levies and taxes other than those officially stipulated. Regarding the current practical malpractices, he solemnly declared that these were unavoidable measures during times of turmoil and would strive for simplicity and certainty to avoid disturbing the people. It can be seen that the authorities are not entirely unaware of the various situations of the officials harassing the people and the people being unable to make a living. It is a pity that he did not mention a word about the fine-meshed prohibition and the thorny path for merchants, the difficulties faced by factory owners, and the dilemma of wanting to stop but being unable to. Whether he has grasped the center of gravity in clearing obstacles and creating a barely sustainable production environment remains to be proven by facts. However, we believe that if these two symptoms of too much currency and too little material are not treated with the right medicine and fundamentally treated, then asking for economic stability and price stability is probably like climbing a tree to catch fish.</p>

<p>[News from Our Agency] London, 18th (Broadcast): Berlin reports that currency reform in the three Western occupation zones has been announced tonight, with Berlin temporarily excluded. According to regulations, West Germans holding identification and ration cards can exchange sixty old Marks for sixty new Marks, to be issued in two installments. The first installment of forty Marks will be issued on Sunday, and the remaining twenty Marks will be issued one month later. From June 21st, old Marks will be invalidated, except for metal coins and one-Mark notes, which will remain in circulation to prevent a shortage of change, but their value will be one-tenth of a new Mark. Detailed measures will be announced gradually.</p>
<p>[News from Our Agency] London, 18th (Broadcast): Paris reports that, according to information obtained by the French government, the Soviet Union is preparing to announce currency reform in the Soviet occupation zone of Germany within 48 hours, taking independent action.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Berlin, 17th] Reliable sources claim that the currency reform in the British, French, and American zones of Western Germany can be formally announced on the 18th. The military governors of the three powers will issue a broadcast on that day, announcing the currency reform plan to the German people. The currency reform will be implemented from the 20th. In the first week, old and new Marks will be exchanged at par value. After one week, the exchange rate will be ten old Marks for one new Mark.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Berlin, 18th] The Germans are awaiting the Western German currency reform plan, which will be announced within a few hours and implemented on Sunday, with extreme tension. The German Economic Council of the British and American Combined Zone convened an emergency meeting at 3 a.m. this morning to inform the members of the situation before the announcement of the currency reform. According to reports from the American military zone's German News Agency, Economic Council Chairman Köhler told the participating members that currency reform is the most painful experience for a country and is a direct result of the Nazi regime. After the first step of the currency reform is completed, the members must provide advice and support to the German nation. It is reported that Soviet military government chief Sokolovsky made a final suggestion to the British, Americans, and French in Berlin yesterday, offering to implement currency reform throughout Germany on a four-power basis.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Berlin, 18th] Meyer, Chairman of the Economic Administration Commission of the Soviet Zone, declared today that no measures have been taken regarding the independent currency reform of the Soviet Zone. However, he also said that if the Western occupation zones adopt independent currency reform, then various steps will also be taken. German financial circles speculate that the Soviet Zone authorities will not issue new currency, as planned by the two occupation zones, but will wait for a short period to see the results of the Western occupation zones before deciding.</p>

<p>[Reuters, Berlin, 17th] Germans close to the Soviet military government revealed that senior Soviet officials told Berlin Deputy Mayor Freidenstadt on the 17th that from the time currency reform is implemented in Western Germany, the entire border between the Soviet occupation zone and Western Germany will be sealed off.

<p>[United Press, London, 18th] Diplomatic observers here believe that Poland's request to reopen the Allied Control Council may be the beginning of a Soviet effort to indefinitely delay the six-nation Western plan. The British Foreign Office refused to comment immediately on Poland's note presented in Berlin and the country's protest to France against the six-nation agreement.</p>

<p>American Ambassador Douglas paid a routine visit to British Foreign Secretary Bevin at the Foreign Office on the 18th. It is believed that the two will discuss Poland's actions and France's attitude. Foreign Office officials admit that Poland has always paid close attention to Germany, but speculate that Poland's proposal to reopen the Allied Control Council was orchestrated by the Soviet Union. Soviet Commander Sokolovsky withdrew from the Allied Control Council on March 20th, forcing the council to shut down. If the Soviet Union currently intends to restore it, it can be in a more bargainable position by having a third party suggest it. Some Britons fear that once the council is reopened, the Soviet Union will use it to spread propaganda against the Allied powers' plans for Germany.</p>

<p>[Reuters, Washington, 17th] The State Department is closely watching the situation in Burma, and diplomatic circles are speculating about the possibility of a communist offensive in the Far East. They particularly point out the recent comparative calm in Europe, the recent unrest in Burma and Malaya, the Soviet Union's concessions on reparations to Hungary, Finland, and Romania, and the stabilizing trend of the Greek civil war, all of which indicate that the Communist Party in Europe has shifted from offense to defense, while in Asia it has shifted from defense to offense.</p>
<p>The well-known "Washington Post" reporter Lippmann, who is close to the State Department, wrote in the newspaper that the new Soviet representatives to the United Nations and the ambassadors to the United States are all experts on Asian issues. Judging from past experience, the Soviet Union often changes diplomatic officials when it is preparing to change its policies. Lippmann also pointed out that most Asian nations have never known what freedom is, so communism is easier to develop in Asia than in Europe. It is feared that the nationalistic tendencies of Indonesia, Vietnam, Burma, and India are more likely to lean towards Moscow than towards the West.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Singapore, 17th] The Federation of Malaya has declared a state of emergency throughout the Federation to deal with acts of violence and illegal activities throughout the country.

<h3 id="e70">A Perspective on the Varga Incident <a href="#e70" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c70" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">70</a></h3>
<p>— Huang Shaozu</p>
<p>Is E. Varga always the supreme authority in Soviet economics, and the leading figure in the entire world of Marxist economic theory? Although he was originally from Hungary, he had long acquired Soviet citizenship, and for two or three decades since the Soviet October Revolution, he had consistently occupied the throne of Soviet economic theory. He has written many works, and almost every one of them is representative and of great significance. In particular, almost every year in the past, he published an article summarizing and predicting the Soviet economy and the capitalist world economy. The content was nothing more than a stark contrast, proclaiming how the Soviet socialist economy was becoming increasingly prosperous and developed, while the economy of the capitalist world was becoming increasingly chaotic and declining. Most touchingly, he annually declared that the capitalist economy had developed to its final stage, so a worldwide economic panic would immediately occur, leading to the total collapse of the capitalist economy. Although these words were spoken every year, and each time they turned out to be wrong, their impact was still enormous. Not only did the Soviet authorities attach unusual importance and encouragement to it, spreading his views as widely as possible, but leftists all over the world also regarded his every word as golden rules, as valuable keys to understanding current economic phenomena. Therefore, citations like "as Varga said" were seen everywhere. In short, among Marxist economists of the same era, no one's position and reputation were as esteemed and lofty as his.</p>
<p>However, it is precisely this Mr. Varga who is now being fiercely criticized and rigorously purged by the Soviet authorities and the Soviet economics community. What is the reason for being suddenly thrown from heaven to earth? The reason is that his current views are contrary to his past predictions. He actually believes that the capitalist world economy will not only not "collapse" for the time being, but also has a certain prospect for development. Such "reactionary" views could hardly be tolerated by the Soviet authorities and Marxist "orthodox" scholars, and he would inevitably suffer serious blows.</p>
<p>The actual situation of the Varga incident is as follows: Last autumn, based on his careful observation of the real situation of the world economy, Varga wrote the book "Changes in the Capitalist Economy Since the End of World War II." In this book, his basic viewpoints are:</p>
<p>(1) He believes that the state played a decisive role in the economies of capitalist countries during the war, and that capitalist countries also have a certain "supra-class nature," that is, although they represent the overall interests of the bourgeoisie as a whole, they often individually oppose the interests of certain bourgeoisies. His original words were: "The bourgeois state here represents the interests of the entire bourgeoisie as a class. It strives to make the most appropriate use of national resources for war purposes, and as a result, it often conflicts with the private interests of individual capitalist attempts and their desire to extract as much profit as possible." He cited the government's opposition to and suppression of the monopolies or speculative behavior of private capitalists as examples to illustrate. At the same time, he further believes that "in the post-war period, the role of the state will be even more significant than during the war."</p>
<p>(2) Furthermore, he pointed out that the long-held view that the capitalist economy cannot be planned is erroneous and does not conform to the facts. He said: "Regarding the issue of planning under the capitalist system, we are also often constrained by old ideas, always believing that we have a planned economy, while under the capitalist system, production is everywhere, always and indiscriminately controlled by a state of anarchy. I don't think the issue should be raised like this." Then, he admitted: "In some capitalist countries, there has appeared something similar to a unique 'national plan'."</p>
<p>(3) He divides the changes in the post-war capitalist world economy into two types—temporary and long-term. He believes that temporary changes will determine the development of capitalism in the next ten years or so; while long-term changes will only be fully revealed after the countries reach the pre-war production level, that is, at least ten years later. In the first stage, he said: "The imbalance of economic development during the war will have a decisive impact on the economic development of capitalism." It will not be until the second stage, when the changes in capitalism caused by the war are fully revealed, that they will be manifested in "the fundamental contradiction of the capitalist system—the intensification of the contradiction between the socialization of production and the privatization of ownership, and will first be manifested in the market problem." That is to say, within the next ten years, the inherent contradictions of capitalism will not unfold and deepen, so capitalism still has a period of development prospects. However, he has repeatedly declared in the past that capitalism has developed to its third stage, that is, the final stage.</p>
<p>(4) Varga's evaluation of the so-called "new democratic" economy in Southeast European countries is very low. He believes that in those countries, "state capitalism occupies a dominant position, but it cannot be regarded as a new type of capitalist (in the old sense) economy appearing in these countries, and they cannot fundamentally change the development prospects of the entire capitalism." That is to say, he believes that the development of the capitalist economy is still the main content of current history.</p>
<p>The above theory is obviously completely contrary to his past views, that is, the orthodox Marxist views, and the views that meet the actual requirements of Soviet policy. This will naturally cause a major criticism from the Soviet orthodox economics community, and further lead to a ruthless purge by the Soviet authorities.</p>
<p>In particular, the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, which bears the actual highest leadership responsibility in the Soviet Union, is particularly disgusted with this. Because with Varga's position, writing such a viewpoint would naturally have a great adverse impact on her external Cold War propaganda or internal rule education. Therefore, in any case, Varga must be severely criticized and severely attacked, and he must be completely overthrown.</p>
<p>The specific arrangement is: on the one hand, all orthodox Marxist economists were mobilized to publish criticisms in newspapers and magazines, criticizing Varga's "mistakes"; on the other hand, a large-scale gathering of economists was convened, nominally as a "review meeting" but actually equivalent to a "trial," to have Varga publicly attend and answer questions, making him the target of public criticism, and allowing everyone to refute him "to the point of being completely defeated." This was not enough. In addition, he was removed from his original position as director of the Institute of International Economics of the Soviet Academy of Sciences, and he was also prohibited from giving public lectures and publishing books. As for the book "Changes in the Capitalist Economy Since the End of World War II," it goes without saying that it was regarded as a great treason and was banned from circulation.</p>
<p>At the "review meeting," the views expounded by Varga in this book were naturally criticized to the extreme, pointing out that they "violated Marxist theory" or violated the "opinions" of Lenin and Stalin, but it was rarely or even never seen that they were pointed out to be contrary to the facts. Therefore, the Soviet authorities and this group of orthodox Marxist economists' struggle to purge Varga is precisely a struggle between "dogma" and "truth," a struggle between "propaganda" and "facts." Varga has always obeyed "dogma" and willingly "propagated," and all he has received is praise, no blame; only happiness, no misfortune. Once he, based on the last conscience of a theoretical worker, is unwilling to turn white into black again, pursue facts, and follow the truth, then he will naturally not be able to stand in a country where everything must obey partisanship, and he will inevitably suffer a fatal blow, and his political life will be purged and ended.</p>
<p>But as a theoretical worker with independent thought and a complete personality, he should be such a brave man who is loyal to the truth and loyal to the facts. We see that even at the "review meeting," Varga still defended his views eloquently. It is not that he does not love his motherland, the Soviet Union, and even more so that he does not love himself personally, but he loves the truth even more and respects the facts even more, so he naturally and bravely did so regardless of success or failure and regardless of danger. This spirit of Varga is worthy of respect from every conscientious person.</p>

<p>Managing Bank Note Shops, Selling Materials, Sending Three Key Members of the National Bank to North China to Prevent Floating Capital from Coming South</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Yu Hongjun, President of the National Bank, returned to Shanghai from Nanjing yesterday and visited Mayor Wu in the afternoon to discuss strengthening the crackdown on speculation involving gold and banknotes. At 5:00 PM, he held a press conference and announced three important measures: (1) In order to prevent credit expansion and control prices, the government has decided to strictly manage the issuance of bank notes. From today (the 19th), when bank note shops issue bank notes, the balance of the bank note account for the day must have sufficient funds deposited in the National Bank or the clearing house. After this measure is implemented, the outstanding balance of bank notes issued by bank note shops in the past must be supplemented and deposited with the National Bank. Those who fail to report accurately will be subject to revocation of their licenses. (2) Starting today, the government will sell off large quantities of yarn, cloth, and other materials without rigidly setting prices. (3) In order to prevent floating capital from coming south from North China, responsible personnel from the National Bank will be sent north within days to improve exchange restrictions to prevent the private transportation of cash. At the same time, materials will be sold off in North China, and short-term treasury bonds will be vigorously promoted in Beijing and Tianjin to absorb floating capital.</p>
<p>Regarding the key members of the National Bank sent to North China, Yu announced yesterday that they are Li Lixia (Director of the Audit Department), Xia Jinxiong (Director of the National Treasury Bureau), and Wang Wei (Director of the National Bank's Northeast Region). Yu also stated that yesterday (the 18th), he had discussed the issue of cracking down on the black market for gold with Mayor Wu and would coordinate with the military police to implement it. He firmly believes that there will be no black market activities for gold and banknotes in the city today.</p>

<h3 id="e83">Director of the Central Trust Bureau, Wu Rencang, Dies of a Stroke, Body Moved to China Funeral Home for Final Farewell Tomorrow Afternoon <a href="#e83" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c83" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">83</a></h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Mr. Wu Rencang, Director of the Central Trust Bureau, suddenly suffered a stroke and died at 5:00 PM yesterday afternoon at the age of 45. Since taking office in March of last year, Mr. Wu has worked tirelessly to rectify the bureau affairs. Due to excessive hard work, he has suffered from high blood pressure since last winter. In mid-March of this year, Mr. Wu once collapsed in his office. At that time, the doctor advised him to rest. However, after resting for a week and his blood pressure dropped slightly, Mr. Wu continued to work as usual. At about 1:00 PM yesterday afternoon, Mr. Wu invited the managers of the Guangzhou, Hong Kong, and Taiwan branches of the bureau, as well as senior personnel from the Shanghai branch, to his residence for a lunch discussion on the transfer and handling of American aid materials. He felt uncomfortable at that time, and suddenly collapsed at about 2:00 PM. His family invited doctors from the Hongqiao, Zhongshan, and Zhongde Hospitals to diagnose him, and he was diagnosed with a stroke. Because the blood vessels had ruptured, a bloodletting operation could not be performed. Although he was injected with stimulants and rescued in many ways, all efforts were ineffective. He died at 5:00 PM. People from all walks of life were shocked and deeply saddened. The body will be given a final farewell at the China Funeral Home at 3:00 PM on the 20th, and the burial date has not been determined. Mr. Wu devoted himself to public affairs during his lifetime, disregarding his own interests. His 81-year-old mother had just arrived in Shanghai from her hometown. He is survived by his wife, three sons, and two daughters. The eldest son is only fourteen years old.</p>
<p>Replacement Candidate Not Yet Determined</p>
<p>As for the issue of the replacement for the vacant position of Director of the Central Trust Bureau, it will be decided by the bureau's board of directors. The chairman of the board, Zhang Songtao, was immediately notified by telephone. The secretariat of the Central Trust Bureau also sent a formal letter to the secretariat of the board of directors. However, due to the urgency of the matter and the fact that the bureau affairs cannot be left vacant for a day, the chairman of the board may first issue an emergency instruction this morning, designating a special person to act as the director, and then convene a board meeting to discuss the replacement candidate.</p>

<p>[Report from Wujin on the 18th] Hua Xingsheng and others, the fugitives in the Hu Tangqiao military and agricultural support bandit case, have been living in Shanghai for many years. They have their own western-style houses and live in luxury. Recently, they have regrouped and cooperated, pooling shares, hiring multiple wooden boats with false bottoms, buying military uniforms and military supplies in separate groups, hiding them at the bottom, and covering them with sugarcane and other items. They declared to customs that they were shipping them to Qingdao for export, but they actually delivered them to the bandit areas in northern Jiangsu, earning profits of 30 to 40 times. Bandits along the way provided care. Hua and others traveled by land from Wuxi, Chengjiang to Jingjiang, using secret codes to enter the bandit area, and most of the payments were made in gold. This had happened more than once. The county criminal police team learned of this and disguised themselves on the 15th, arresting Hua and his accomplices Xu Kaisheng, Zhou Xinfu, and 12 others at the Zhongnan Hotel at 506 Zhongzheng Road in Shanghai. They also seized two boxes of rifle screws, four boxes of box gun screws, dozens of pieces of purple copper plate for making bullet casings, and hundreds of buckets of detonators. People and stolen goods were all brought to Changzhou and are currently under strict interrogation.</p>

<h3 id="e86">President of Jiaotong University Goes to Nanjing to Resign, Issues a Thousand-Word Proclamation Before Leaving, Accusing Students of Disregarding Discipline <a href="#e86" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c86" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">86</a></h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Mayor Wu's second inquiry to Jiaotong University regarding the student anti-Japanese parade on June 5 has been answered by the school. Cheng Xiaogang, President of Jiaotong University, went to Nanjing the night before to resign to the authorities. The executive committee of the Student Union also resigned en masse yesterday.</p>
<p>President Cheng has found it quite difficult to handle school affairs in recent years, and has repeatedly requested to resign since January of last year. After repeated retention by alumni and students, his resignation intention has not been dispelled. He has not received his salary for June, which indicates his firm intention to resign. Before going to Nanjing this time, he wrote a proclamation to all students, with several thousand words, in addition to blaming himself for "lacking virtue and ability" and failing to eliminate the student unrest in advance, he also accused "students of greatly disregarding discipline, and even resisting the discipline implemented by the school on the pretext of causing some bad habits." He criticized the Student Union, saying that "not only has it never led autonomy, nor has it assisted the school, and it often destroys order first, and even hinders the school from maintaining order," pointing to it as a factor in the school's instability and lack of progress.</p>
<h3 id="e87">Proposed Dissolution of Student Union <a href="#e87" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c87" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">87</a></h3>
<p>In Principal Cheng's announcement, he stated: "Since the last student union's unsuccessful dissuasion and prohibition, and the subsequent resolution to march, the faculty has requested that I sanction the student union. After careful consideration, I intend to dissolve it and prohibit the current officers from being re-elected. I am confident that this action will benefit both the school and the students. Unfortunately, the Municipal Government also inquired about the matter and suggested an investigation. Considering that one offense should not be punished twice, I have temporarily suspended the proceedings. However, the school's position must be stated clearly, and I hope the student union will reflect on its actions." He concluded by advising that if they could deeply reflect and repent now, it would not be too late. Because Principal's Cheng's announcement contained many criticisms of them, twenty officers of the National Chiao Tung University Student Self-Government Association collectively resigned yesterday and issued an announcement to all students, stating that their initial purpose in being elected was to serve all students and maintain the honor of Chiao Tung University. Now that the principal believed they were doing the opposite, they were resigning to take responsibility. They also expressed their firm support for retaining Principal Cheng. In addition, they declared three points: (1) After resigning, they would bear absolute and complete responsibility for all work done during their term. The new self-government association would have no connection to any work done during their term. (2) Before the new self-government association was formed, all aspects of the current association's work would continue as usual. (3) Regarding the work done during this term and the difficulties with Shanghai, they would give a detailed report to the students before formally resigning and the new self-government association was formed, and would invite students to thoroughly criticize and review it.</p>

<h3 id="e93">Preliminary Examination of "Shanghai Yang Sister" Shows No Abnormalities, Has Been Drinking Water and Smoking Cigarettes for Three Days <a href="#e93" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c93" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">93</a></h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Reports] Whether "Shanghai Yang Sister" Zhang Dailin has not eaten for several years and what her current living conditions are like is a question that various parties in the city are waiting for the answer to gradually unfold. According to Huang Linshu, a specialist from the Social Affairs Bureau who has become Zhang's "temporary father", based on three days of on-site observation: Zhang is not absolutely not eating, but has eaten one banana in three days, drinks four cups of water each time, and smokes twenty high-quality cigarettes. Zhang moved into Huang's residence on the 16th, and the 17th was her regular "three-day feeding" period. However, because she saw a report in a newspaper on the same day that she was a dancing girl, she was very unhappy and angrily gave up the banana. Although Huang bought more bananas yesterday and advised her to eat them, she said that "expired food should be discarded", so she has not eaten any food except for water and cigarettes for the past three days.</p>
<p>Yesterday, Huang invited Dr. Li Lin to conduct a preliminary physiological examination of Zhang. The examination results: no swollen lymph nodes, normal uterine position, and no abnormalities in any part of the body, only a slightly weak pulse. Li regretted that he was unable to examine Zhang's excrement, because Zhang happened to be menstruating on the 17th, and she had several bowel movements every day, but all of them had been flushed down the toilet, so he could not make a definitive judgment based solely on a morphological examination. Starting today, Li decided to work with two nurses to conduct a more detailed study of Zhang's life. If he can reach a conclusion within a few days, he will submit it to the Shanghai Medical Association and request that Zhang be moved to a quiet hospital, where all Shanghai doctors and physiologists will be responsible for the research task. The medical community in this city has long been eager to study Yang Sister, and this opportunity to study Zhang may lead to an honorary discovery about human physiology.</p>
<p>When Zhang appeared before reporters yesterday after a four-hour afternoon nap, it was hard to believe that she was a woman who had not eaten for several years. Her hair was shiny, her eyes sparkled, her skin was fair, her figure was slender, she was barefoot but wore high-heeled shoes, a red floral linen cheongsam, her steps were light, and she spoke softly and politely. In particular, her body was well-proportioned, and her breasts were high. According to the medical principle that muscles must be nourished by protein, Dr. Li said that he could not explain her not eating in terms of common sense.</p>
<p>However, there were two points in which she differed slightly from ordinary people: she had a particularly keen sense of feeling and a vague memory. She often complained that the teacup had an annoying smell, so Huang Linshu specially bought her a new cup. She also often frowned and changed her expression while talking and laughing, got up from her seat, and no one could understand why her emotions changed so quickly and abruptly, as if there was no one else present. She said that she had been in Shanghai for three or four years, and also said that she had been there for more than ten years. She claimed that she had started not eating when she was sixteen, and also said that she was twelve, but she only determined her age to be twenty-one, but no one could believe that this was her real age.</p>
<p>Because Zhang's nerves seemed to be abnormal, her background was difficult to confirm. According to her own account, she is from Tianjin, her parents died early, and her husband, Zhang Pengfei (i.e., Zhang Tianyi), worked in Guangde during the Anti-Japanese War. After the victory, he was sent to Tianjin to take over the Jinpu Railway section, and the two fell in love and married at this time. Zhang Pengfei is currently a security inspector at the Port Affairs Committee, but because it is difficult to find a house in Shanghai, he has not yet settled down. Zhang now hopes to have children to relieve her loneliness. According to Dr. Li's observation, she likes to be close to children and likes to dress up, which proves that she still has sexual desires, and her menstruation still comes every three months, so it is not impossible for her to have children.</p>
<p>Talking About the Reason for Not Eating: Due to Stepmother's Abuse</p>
<p>Zhang's intelligence is no different from that of ordinary people, and she is especially lacking in the appearance of someone who does not eat. She reads newspapers every day, has a high level of understanding, can sing, is good at dancing, and can speak fluent Shanghainese in addition to Mandarin. The night before last, she went to the Minguang Theater to watch the movie "The侠盗平番" (The Chivalrous Bandit Pacifies the Barbarians), but there was no reaction on her face after watching it. She claimed that she had been abused by her stepmother since she was a child, so she resolved to stop eating. After moving into Huang's residence, she covered her face and passed by when she saw others eating, looking quite disgusted. Someone told her that her not eating would cause serious abnormal behavior, and she said with emotion: "At most, I'll just die", and her words were full of infinite sadness. When she saw Huang Linshu and his wife, she shouted adoptive parents, which was very gentle, and she seemed to be in urgent need of loving care. Based on these two points, it is speculated that Zhang's nerves may be slightly abnormal, possibly due to deep stimulation in her early years. However, the maid at Zhang's previous residence said that her stepmother had recently sent a letter to her, intending to provide her with financial assistance, so her relationship with her stepmother did not seem to be broken.</p>
<p>Believes in Buddhism and Christianity, Actions are Puzzling</p>
<p>Since the news of Yang Sister's not eating spread, Zhang smiled secretly at how surprised and strange the world was. When various parties commented that not eating was definitely impossible, she cursed and rebuked them, and that's how her not eating was finally revealed. She said that she had been a Buddhist since she was a child, and recently became a devout Christian, but if she was forced to read scriptures or attend services, she would not be interested. Yesterday, she entered the room to visit Huang's mother, who was sick in bed, and refused to allow anyone else to enter at the same time. Later, Huang peeked through the keyhole and saw her writing rapidly on paper with a pencil, like drawing talismans, then sticking the paper on the Guanyin statue on the wall in a circle, drinking a mouthful of water and spitting it out like a Taoist priest performing a ritual, and finally tapping Huang's mother all over the body, with a tense and forceful movement, which was even more puzzling.</p>
<p>Zhang has an extremely strong sense of beauty. Because her face is slightly asymmetrical, she often covers her forehead with her hair to maintain facial balance. She also went to the hairdresser's the other day to perm her hair. Dr. Li pointed out that this was unimaginable, because the temperature of the head during a perm is extremely high, and the smell of ammonia is pungent, which a person who has not eaten for several years and has a nervous disorder would not be able to tolerate. Zhang loves cleanliness as if it were her life, and if her clothes have any oil stains, she throws them away. She gets up at 6:00 AM every morning, regardless of the cold or heat. She often talks to herself. Apart from the fact that her abdomen is particularly sunken, she does not think there is anything abnormal about her inner self or physiology, and she also says to people, what is so special about not eating? Why is everyone so surprised!</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper Reports] On the morning of the 5th of this month, a man claiming to be Mi Dafeng, the section chief of the Municipal Government's Protocol Department, suddenly came to Shunxing Flower Shop at No. 47, Beier Road in the middle of the city, and ordered three flower baskets. He wrote the names of Mayor Wu Guozhen, Social Affairs Bureau Director Wu Kaixian, and Police Bureau Director Yu Shuping on the red ribbons, and asked them to be sent to Qiu Qiu's wedding at the Kang Le Restaurant on the afternoon of the 6th. The price was agreed to be 4 million yuan, discounted to 70%, and Zhu signed a check for 2.8 million yuan from the Juxingcheng Bank. Before leaving, he left the phone number 16130. The next day, when the shop went to Juxingcheng to cash the check, it was returned. The shop manager, Li, asked about it by telephone through the number Zhu left, and learned that there was no such person as Zhu in the Municipal Government. Only then did he realize that he had been deceived. Later, the police station detained Zhu based on the check's record. It was said that his real name was Qiu Degen, and he was the manager of the Metropolitan Theater at No. 427 Changshou Road. He married a woman named Qiu Jinqiu at the Kang Le Restaurant on the 6th of this month. In order to splurge and show off to his relatives and friends, he impersonated others to send flower baskets. Later, the police also took out Qiu's wedding guest book, which showed that in addition to the three flower baskets, there was also a festive banner sent by Finance Minister Wang Yunwu. At the same time, Qiu still owed Kang Le's wedding banquet bill of 150 million yuan, which had not been paid off. The police station considered Qiu to be guilty of fraud and deception, and will transfer him to the District Prosecutor's Office for questioning within the next few days.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper Reports] The Datong ship has been anchored in Hong Kong for more than a year. Due to its age and disrepair, it is difficult to resume sailing. It has now been sold to a company in this city to dismantle the ship's steel plates for other uses. It was entrusted to the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company to send the Minsan 302 tugboat to tow it from Hong Kong on the 13th. When it arrived at the Wenzhou sea area the day before yesterday, it was discovered that the ship's hull was taking in about one hour of water every hour. They immediately tried to pump water and increase the speed of the ship. It is reported that they arrived at the Tongsha sea area at the Yangtze River estuary yesterday morning, but the amount of water entering the hull gradually increased, which was extremely dangerous. The tugboat tried its best to rescue it, and it is expected that it can enter the port this morning.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper Reports] The home of Li Anfa, the owner of the Shengli Cotton Mill at No. 125, Yongyuan Lane, Nanjing West Road, was invaded by four robbers at about 10 PM last night. Li happened to be returning home with a girl. After knocking on the door several times, there was no movement for a long time. Before long, one of the robbers opened the door and dragged Li and the girl into the house. Li, knowing that he had encountered a robbery, shouted for help. The robbers then snatched twenty-six small packages of cotton yarn, a gold ring, and 2 million yuan in cash and fled. After hearing the news, the nearby police station urgently telegraphed the Jing'an Temple Police Sub-bureau, which immediately ordered officers to take several police vehicles and surround the area. At about 11 PM, they intercepted a tricycle at the entrance of No. 504, Panyu Road, which was fully loaded with seventeen packages of stolen cotton yarn. One robber was captured on the spot, and he and the stolen goods were taken to the sub-bureau.

<p>[Our Newspaper Reports] In order to build a Greater Shanghai and restore the city's post-war municipal administration, the Municipal Government has selected the Zhabei West District as the area to implement the urban planning work. The preliminary plan for the first phase of the reconstruction of the Zhabei West District in Shanghai has been approved by the Municipal Government meeting and will be submitted to the Municipal Council and the Executive Yuan for review before implementation. Director Zhao of the Public Works Bureau specially convened reporters at the bureau's conference room at 5:00 PM yesterday to report on the detailed plan, which stated in summary: The construction projects in the district include roads, ditches, green spaces, public buildings, demolition of houses, and installation of street lights, etc. According to estimates at the end of April this year, a total of over 580 billion yuan is required, which is planned to be paid from the land price obtained from the more than 8,000 mu of housing sites reserved for reconstruction funds, and the Municipal Government will provide part of the funds as appropriate if necessary. In order to achieve rapid realization, it has been decided that the construction part of the project will be handled by the Public Works Bureau, and the requisition, planning, and land distribution parts will be handled by the Land Administration Bureau, and will be implemented immediately. The construction and land consolidation funds should be from the housing sites that are allocated; the funds can be raised immediately through the sale of houses; and the land area should be valued as a supplement.

<h3 id="e104">Shanghai Banking, Money Exchange, and Trust Industries Association Formulates Method for Using Sight Drafts as Collateral, Financial Control Bureau Approves Trial Implementation Today <a href="#e104" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c104" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">104</a></h3>
<p>Since the restriction on the use of checks as collateral, cash payments and receipts by banks have increased sharply, and the issuance of cashier's checks has become frequent. Coupled with limited time and manpower, banks and customers often compete for the first position, losing sight of the other. In view of this, in order to improve and reduce the exchange of cashier's checks, the Shanghai Financial Control Bureau previously instructed the city's Banking, Money Exchange, and Trust Industries Association to formulate a method for customers to use various sight drafts for collection as collateral, taking into account the actual situation of the banks themselves and considering the convenience of factories and industries. The Financial Control Bureau has approved the trial implementation of the method today. The method is recorded below:</p>
<p>(1) For customers who request that deposited drafts be used as collateral on the same day, the banks should carefully investigate their creditworthiness. If they are considered eligible, they should be required to find a reliable guarantor and sign a "Draft Collateral Guarantee Letter" before they can be approved for use as collateral. (2) The banks should copy and report the customer's account name, account number, address, and guarantor's name to the Financial Control Bureau for record. If the bank believes that the customer's credit is poor or there are unstable circumstances, it may report to the Financial Control Bureau to stop their use as collateral at any time. However, once reported, the customer may not apply to restore the use of collateral again. (3) For customers who abuse the issuance of bounced checks, if three returned checks occur consecutively, in addition to reporting to the association as usual, sending a circular to the industry, and stopping transactions with the customer, they should also report the facts to the Financial Control Bureau. Depending on the circumstances, they may be reported to the court, and a public prosecution may be filed according to law. The relevant banks should be responsible for providing evidence. It is expected that the implementation of this method will reduce the circulation of cashier's checks.</p>
<h3 id="e105">Authorities Did Not Sell Rice Yesterday, Rice is High-Priced but No Goods, Those Holding Goods Are Not Willing to Easily Sell <a href="#e105" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c105" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">105</a></h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Reports] Rice was high-priced but no goods yesterday. The government still strictly enforces the price limit and did not sell rice yesterday. Although there were bids outside the market, such as 10.56 million yuan per stone, no transactions were made. The supply of goods in the north and south markets was scarce. The south market only had Indica rice, 9.65 million yuan per stone, and the rest were Baiyuan and Yinyuan, and Baijing rice was nowhere to be found. 1,420 stones of rice arrived in the south market, and 1,842 stones of rice arrived in the north market, for a total of 3,262 stones. The reason for the scarce supply is that the price in the production area is higher than in this city, and merchants have no profit to transport rice to Shanghai.</p>
<p>Looking at the rice market yesterday, it seemed that it did not exceed the price limit on the surface, but those holding the goods waited for the opportunity to watch the changes and were unwilling to sell at a low price, resulting in no goods being supplied to the market, creating a situation of external relaxation and internal tension. However, the evening paper yesterday said that the price of rice had risen to 12 million yuan per stone, which, according to Ji Mingzhai, the chief of the Grain Section of the Social Affairs Bureau, was absolutely untrue. The arrival of the first batch of US-aid rice in Shanghai had no major impact on the market price of rice, because the rice was allocated to households and not to the market, but it had a considerable effect on stabilizing people's hearts.</p>

<p>Soaring even more, people are firmly bullish, and cargo owners have no intention of selling, causing prices to jump sharply.

The opening prices of Shefeng and Jiancheng were 3.7 million yuan, an increase of 4-500,000 yuan compared to the previous morning.

<p>Soaring rapidly, Hankou soybeans opened at 6.6 million yuan, and the later market retreated slightly to 6.5 million yuan, an increase of 6-700,000 yuan. Corn rose by 6-700,000 yuan due to the indiscriminate acquisition of corn by the North Gang, regardless of the high price. Only inferior red sorghum was traded, and the price was 5 million yuan. Mung beans rose by 500,000 yuan, and broad beans and barley rose by 5-600,000 yuan each. The Tianjin Gang absorbed sesame, which rose wildly by 3 million yuan. The Guang Gang rushed to buy raw peanuts, which rose rapidly by 4 million yuan.</p>

Jittong crude oil was 37.5 million yuan, an increase of 5 million yuan. Raw rapeseed oil rose sharply by 3.56 million yuan, and Xiao Che Ma oil closed at 35 million yuan. Soybean cake rose sharply by 300,000 yuan, and the Changzi Lizi reached the 3 million mark.</p>

<p>Ever since red and green tea saw a sharp rise the other day, the inflationary trend in the market intensified yesterday. The reason is that large amounts of speculative capital are pouring in, and bills are now being accepted for same-day use, resulting in an increasingly loose and oversupplied market, causing fluctuations in all commodities. Tea prices are rising in unison, leading to repeated price surges. As a result, prices rose even higher than before. Trading is still active and vibrant, with domestic sales tea being continuously sought after by merchants on this street and in rural villages. As for export grades, due to exporters' fear of high prices and limited capacity, transactions were only sporadic.</p>

External forces continued to push the price up, making it difficult to fall back. However, there were frequent struggles due to the brokerage fee being 34 or 38 yuan at the original price, which had to be borne for three days.

<p>[Reuters, Zurich, 17th] According to the draw results of the National Football Association, China will meet Turkey in the first elimination round of the World Cup soccer match. If they can defeat Turkey and enter the first round, they will meet Sweden or Austria. A total of twenty-three countries are participating in the soccer match, nine of which are vacant and can enter the first round without competition. The remaining fourteen countries are divided into seven groups for elimination matches to determine the sixteen countries that will qualify for the first week of competition. The elimination matches are China vs. Turkey, Luxembourg vs. Afghanistan, Yugoslavia vs. Pakistan, Ireland vs. Netherlands, Sweden vs. Austria, Burma vs. India, and Egypt vs. Denmark. The nine countries that are vacant are England, France, Hungary, Italy, Korea, the United States, Mexico, Palestine, and Poland. The order of the first round of matches is as follows: Poland vs. the United States, Luxembourg or Afghanistan vs. Egypt or Denmark, Yugoslavia or Pakistan vs. Palestine, France vs. Burma or India, England vs. Ireland or Netherlands, Hungary vs. Italy, Korea vs. Mexico, China or Turkey vs. Sweden or Austria. China has a good chance of winning the elimination preliminary. According to the British Rachell soccer team, which recently went to Turkey, they easily defeated a Turkish representative team in Turkey. If China can defeat Turkey, the first week's opponent, Sweden or Austria, will be a strong enemy.</p>

<p>[Reported by Our Newspaper] Our World Cup basketball team and track and field athletes Huang Liangzheng and Chen Yinglang, led by Jiang Lianggui and Song Junfu, arrived here by train the night before last, arrived at the Dadong Hotel at 7:50 AM yesterday, and played against Dongxing that night at the gymnasium. At 8:00 PM today, they will compete against Renyu at the same location, and will take the night train to leave Shanghai to participate in the President's Flag Presentation Ceremony held in Beijing tomorrow, and then leave Beijing again that night to come to Shanghai. The originally scheduled three games here have been increased to four due to Encas's request to fight against the World Cup team. The order of the other three games is arranged as follows:</p>
<p>[19th] vs. Renyu, 8:00 PM, referees Wu Zibin and Zhu Mingxing [21st] vs. Encas, 7:30 PM [22nd] vs. Dagong, 7:30 PM</p>
<p>Tonight, because the order of the Gongzhan Cup cannot be changed, the game will be changed to start at 8:00 PM. Tickets for the upstairs are still sold for 150,000, the downstairs for 300,000, the numbered seats inside the venue for 600,000, and the gate opens at 7:00 PM. The World Cup team's victory last night was entirely due to their higher individual skills. Tonight, they will fight against Renyu, which has undergone the baptism of new tactics. If the World Cup team's performance is still as scattered as yesterday's game, it is difficult to say who will win. In addition to the old team, Renyu has recently recruited new players such as Le Jiazhou and Zhuang Yirong, making their strength even stronger.</p>
<h3 id="e130">Small Victory Over Dongxing; Disappointing Performance <a href="#e130" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c130" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">130</a></h3>
<p>[Reported by Our Newspaper] The World Cup basketball team won their first game last night with a small victory of 57 to 42 over Dongxing. In the first half, they were only leading by two points, 26 to 24. The World Cup team lacked coordination and had poor communication. The performance did not reach the standard, and the audience was disappointed. In the end, they won due to their higher individual skills. Dongxing committed too many fouls, and their tactics were still poor. It is hoped that the World Cup will improve in their second game against Renyu tonight.</p>
<p>The game started at 7:30 PM. The World Cup team appeared in white vests with national emblems on their chests. Cai Wenhua, Li Shiqiao, Wu Chengzhang, Bao Songyuan, and Fei Tianxi were in the starting lineup. Dongxing started with Wang Chengfang, Tian Fuhai, Wei Qikun, Cao Zhiji, and Zhang Zhidong. The referees were Liu Hesheng and Jin Botao. The World Cup attacked first, and Bao Songyuan made a layup. Dongxing's Zhang Zhi and Tian Fuhai scored consecutively, leading by two points. After a stalemate for several minutes, the score was tied at eight. The World Cup gradually exceeded, reaching 17 to 12. Zhongqiang replaced "Adi." Dongxing fought hard and quickly scored six points, and the situation became tense. Dongxing was only behind by one point, 24 to 26, in the first half.</p>
<p>The second half started, and the World Cup replaced Zhongqiang with Yu Jin. Dongxing's Cao Zhiji made a sneak attack, forcing a tie. The World Cup then rallied, shooting and scoring consecutively. Dongxing made frequent substitutions but still had no chance. The World Cup's situation gradually stabilized. After 37 to 30, Cai Zhongqiang re-entered, and Jia Zhijun, Qian Ruizhang, and captain Li Zhenzhong entered the game. Dongxing's Cao Zhiji committed five fouls and was sent off. Zhang Pu replaced him. When the score was 47 to 37, Wei Qikun was also fouled five times and was sent off. Yu Ruizhang scored a free throw and added seven points. Dongxing made frequent mistakes. When the bell rang, the World Cup won with a score of 57 to 42.</p>

<p>The Municipal Sports Association Football Committee held a committee meeting yesterday afternoon at the Jinlong Hotel to discuss the incident where Donghua team member Hanni Bo assaulted and insulted referee Jiang Yin during the Mayor's Cup final. Yu Hengzhi, Zhou Jiaqi, Wang Xinheng, Xu Huanming, Le Xiurong, Cheng Yize, Wang Zhaohu (representing Wang Xinheng), Shao Rugan, and others attended. Chairman Yu Hengzhi first reported: "During the Donghua Qingbai Mayor's Cup final on the 13th of this month, an incident of assaulting a referee occurred, and we received a protest letter from the Donghua team. This should be discussed." Referee Jiang Yin then reported: "In the Donghua Qingbai Mayor's Cup final, I was the referee. The first half ended in a 1-1 tie. Fifteen minutes into the second half, Donghua's Jia Youliang committed a foul, resulting in a free kick, which Qingbai scored, making it 2-1. After the kickoff, a Donghua defender fouled again. When another free kick was about to be taken, Donghua player Hanni Bo hurled English insults at me and, without asking why, punched me in the face twice. Despite being insulted, I restrained myself and ordered Hanni Bo off the field to continue the game. However, Hanni Bo refused to comply. I then told Donghua team captain Li to order Hanni Bo off the field. Captain Li then stated that Hanni Bo had been ordered off the field and Donghua was willing to forfeit the match. At this point, the match could not continue, so I blew the whistle to end it." After the report, discussions were held, and the following resolutions were passed:</p>
<p>(1) Hanni Bo's assault and insult of the referee is a violation of sportsmanship. He is permanently suspended from participating in all future matches organized by this association. (2) The Donghua team's disrespect for the referee's decision is a violation of the spirit of sports. The match is ruled as a forfeit by the Donghua team. (3) The statement issued by the administrative department on the evening of the 13th regarding the match incident is ratified. (4) Based on the above rulings, the Donghua team's protest regarding the match incident and game time is rejected.</p>

<p>— Deng Guangming</p>
<p>Feeling the Emperor's Grace</p>
<p>In Celebration of Vice Prefect Fan's Birthday</p>
<p>Rare is seventy years since ancient times; everyone says, "How could it be achieved without merits accumulated in secret?" Although the pine's posture is slender, it particularly withstands snow, cold, frost, and dew. Look at the depths of your temples, full of youthful vibrancy.</p>
<p>The snow on the building has just cleared, laughter and merriment fill the courtyard. Why not indulge in a drunken revelry? From now on, enjoy health and longevity, without need for elixirs or magic herbs. You will live to a hundred, defying the aging process.</p>
<p>Again</p>
<p>Celebrating Vice Prefect Fan's Birthday in Chuzhou</p>
<p>The beauty of spring arrives with Qingming, a profusion of flowers and willows. Let the music and song persuade you to drink wine. The wine is as good as spring; the colors of spring remain the same year after year. Youth never ages, do you know that?</p>
<p>Looking at you during the banquet, as refined and upright as bamboo and pine. May youth stay with you for a long time. On the path home to the Three Mountains, tomorrow the fragrance of the heavens will adorn your sleeves. Let's raise our golden cups again to wish you a long life.</p>
<p>The above two poems were both written to celebrate Vice Prefect Fan's birthday. The location of the first poem is not specified, while the second poem was written in Chuzhou, presumably during Jiaxuan's tenure as Prefect of Xuzhou. The full name of Vice Prefect Fan is not indicated in the titles of the poems. Now, "Vice Prefect" is an abbreviation for Vice Magistrate, and according to Jiaxuan's history, among his early friends or colleagues named Fan who served as Vice Magistrates, at least two can be found: one is Fan Ang, who served as Acting Vice Magistrate of Xuzhou from 1170 to 1172 during the reign of Emperor Xiaozong of the Song Dynasty, as seen in the records of the Xuzhou Prefectural Gazette's section on Vice Magistrates and the Department of Merit Evaluation in the Draft of the Important Documents of the Song Dynasty; the other is Jiaxuan's father-in-law, Fan Bangyan, who returned to the Song from the Jin in 1161 during the reign of Emperor Gaozong of the Song Dynasty. The Records of Zhenjiang in Zhishun says:</p>
<p>"Fan Bangyan, courtesy name Ganmei, was from Tangshan, Xingzhou. He was a student of the Imperial Academy during the Xuanhe era. At the end of the Jingkang era, Xingzhou was captured, and he entered the Jin. He passed the local examination and served as the magistrate of Xixin County in Caizhou. During the Shaoxing era, he led his people to open Caizhou to welcome the Song army, then went south to Run. He was granted the position of Registrar of Huzhou, promoted to Prefect of Tongzhou, and died in office at the age of seventy-four."</p>
<p>Mu's Collection from Lingyang includes an article titled "Writing at the Home of Fan Lei Qing," which contains a passage about Fan Bangyan:</p>
<p>"Lord Fan Lei Qing,... his fourth ancestor was known as the Mengchang of Hebei. During the Jingkang Rebellion, he was able to preserve his clan, taking care of the poor and aiding the distressed, showing complete faith and righteousness. He passed the Jinshi examination and became the magistrate of Xixin County in Caizhou. In the tenth month of the Xinyi year of the Shaoxing era, he led his county to return [to the Song].... He should have been granted an extraordinary promotion as encouragement, but was only made Assistant Magistrate of Changxing County in Huzhou, wearing scarlet robes and a silver fish, not fully in accordance with regulations? ... He was then changed to Secretary of the Zhenjiang Military Prefecture in charge of official matters, summoned to the capital for review, and appointed Vice Prefect of the prefecture until he died in office.... The Lord and Lord Xin Qiji returned one after the other, knowing each other for their loyalty and righteousness. Lord Xin then married the Lord's daughter. The Lord was aware of the times. Lord Chen Junqing and Lord Wang Yan all knew the Lord, but the Lord was old and not ultimately employed, placing his hopes in the future.... Alas, the Lord was ill-fated."</p>
<p>Although the locations where Fan Bangyan served as Secretary and Vice Prefect differ in these two accounts, both books agree that Fan did indeed serve as Vice Prefect and died in office. If we were to choose between the two accounts, I would prefer to rely on Mu’s account, as it is based on Fan’s family genealogy.</p>
<p>Is the Vice Prefect Fan in the titles of these two "Feeling the Emperor's Grace" poems Fan Bangyan? Or is it Fan Ang? Is the Vice Prefect Fan in the first poem Bangyan, while the Vice Prefect of Chuzhou is Fan Ang?</p>
<p>Judging from the scenery described in the two poems, one was written on a day when "the snow on the building had just cleared," while the other was written during the "profusion of flowers and willows" of Qingming. The timing seems inconsistent. Therefore, I initially believed that the Vice Prefect Fan in these two poems must not refer to the same person. The one born around Qingming must be Fan Ang (because this poem was written in Chuzhou), and the one born on the day when "the snow on the building had just cleared" must be Fan Bangyan. From the time I began compiling Jiaxuan's chronological biography to the day I finished writing "A Study of Jiaxuan's Social Circle," I had always held this view. However, recently, while reviewing old works, I felt that this view should be revised: both of these "Feeling the Emperor's Grace" poems must have been written for Fan Bangyan. The reasons are:</p>
<p>First, one of the poems contains the line "Looking at you during the banquet, as refined and upright as bamboo and pine," while the other contains the line "Although the pine's posture is slender." If the Vice Prefect Fan in these two poems were not the same person, it is unlikely that both of them would happen to have a refined and slender physique.</p>
<p>Second, after Fan Bangyan returned to the Song, he resided in Zhenjiang, and the poem "Celebrating Vice Prefect Fan's Birthday in Chuzhou" contains the line "On the path home to the Three Mountains," which refers to the Golden Mountain, Jiao Mountain, and North Gu Mountain in Zhenjiang. Fan Ang, who served as Vice Prefect in Chuzhou, would not have also happened to be a resident of Zhenjiang.</p>
<p>Third, during the Southern Song Dynasty, the winter solstice usually fell on December 14th or 15th in the Western calendar. Based on this, the Qingming Festival would fall within the second or third month of the Chinese calendar. If someone was born at the end of the second month or the beginning of the third month, the celebration of their birthday in a particular year might be after the Qingming Festival, while in another year, it might be before Qingming. Furthermore, after the "profusion of flowers and willows" of Qingming, it could still snow in the Jianghuai region. For example, in the fourth year of the Qiandao era, Qingming should have fallen on the seventeenth day of the second month, but the Records of the Five Elements in the History of the Song Dynasty records a heavy snowfall on the Gui Chou day of the twentieth day of the second month of that year. Although the location is not specified, it presumably refers to the Jiangzhe region, the heartland of the Southern Song Dynasty. Therefore, although the scenery described in these two "Feeling the Emperor's Grace" poems differs slightly, we can reasonably conclude that they were both written to celebrate the birthday of Fan Bangyan.</p>
<p>Mu's article mentions that when Fan Bangyan was "summoned to the capital for review" in his later years, he was greatly appreciated by Chen Junqing and Wang Yan. In the Song Dynasty, it was common practice that anyone summoned to the capital for review would be examined by the Prime Minister or the Associate Administrator. Since Fan Bangyan was recognized by Chen Junqing and Wang Yan as a result of his review, it means that Fan was reviewed during the time when Chen and Wang were serving as Prime Ministers. According to Xu Ziming's Chronological Record of Prime Ministers of the Song Dynasty, Chen Junqing was appointed Associate Administrator in the eleventh month of the third year of the Qiandao era and was appointed Grand Master of Rectitude, Right Assistant Administrator, and Co-Minister of Affairs in the tenth month of the fourth year. He was dismissed as Prime Minister in the fifth month of the sixth year and sent out to govern Fuzhou. Wang Yan was appointed Academician of the Duanming Hall, Assistant Administrator of the Secretariat-Chancellery, and Acting Associate Administrator in the second month of the fourth year of the Qiandao era. He was appointed Associate Administrator and concurrently in charge of national expenditures in the second month of the fifth year, and in the third month, he was sent out as Pacification Commissioner of Sichuan with the title of Grand Master of the Left, still serving as Associate Administrator. Therefore, the period when Chen and Wang both served as ministers in the court was from the second month of the fourth year to the third month of the fifth year of the Qiandao era. It follows that Fan's summons for review must have occurred no later than the spring of the fifth year of the Qiandao era. After the review, he was appointed Vice Prefect of Zhenjiang, and he died in office before he could be replaced, so Fan must have died no later than the ninth year of the Qiandao era. The Southern Song Dynasty mostly used upright officials as acting Vice Prefects, and it was generally stipulated that they "should not handle official duties." Because they did not handle official duties, they could leave their posts and travel far. It is likely that Jiaxuan had already formed a close relationship with Fan's family at that time, so Fan accompanied him to Huai at the beginning of Jiaxuan's mourning period in the eighth year of the Qiandao era. Since his visit to Huai was only for sightseeing and he held no official position, he could return to his post at any time, so Jiaxuan's birthday poem contains the line "On the path home to the Three Mountains, tomorrow the fragrance of the heavens will adorn your sleeves." In fact, Fan stayed in Xuzhou for a long time before leaving. At that time, Jiaxuan also wrote a "Magnolia Flower Slow" to see him off, which contains the line "Counting the days until Mid-Autumn, the full moon is beautiful, but it does not illuminate a reunion," indicating that it was early autumn.</p>
<p>Based on the above reasoning, Fan's death must have occurred before the ninth year of the Qiandao era, so it must have been shortly after returning to Zhenjiang from Xuzhou, either in the autumn or winter. At that time, Fan was seventy-four years old. If the poem "Rare is seventy years since ancient times" was written in the year Fan turned seventy, it would have been in the spring of the fourth year of the Qiandao era, making it one of the earliest of Jiaxuan's poems whose writing year can be determined. (Written on June 10th, 37th year in the Peking University Dormitory, Beiping)</p>
<h3 id="e139">Distinguishing Errors in Zou Hanxun's "Treatise on the Five Tones" <a href="#e139" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c139" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">139</a></h3>
<p>— Zhou Zumo</p>
<p>In the Qing Dynasty, there were two scholars who were well-versed in phonology and known as masters of rhyme tables: Jiang Yong and Chen Li. Jiang's "Distinguishing Subtle Points in Phonology" and "Table of Initial Consonants and Rhymes for the Four Tones" and Chen's "Outer Chapters of Examination of Initial Consonants and Rhymes" are both works on rhyme tables. However, Jiang blindly adhered to the Song scholars' theory of initial consonants and failed to understand its merits and demerits, while Chen could understand its merits and demerits but could not integrate it with the rhyme books. These were their shortcomings. However, the achievements of both are already remarkable. Zou's book is far inferior to the erudition of these two scholars. It is full of views that are biased towards local dialects, without considering the origins and development and confusing ancient and modern.</p>
<p>The book is divided into two volumes, upper and lower. The upper volume discusses the five tones and the twenty initial consonants; the lower volume discusses the eight opening divisions and the fifteen rhyme categories. In discussing the five tones, he mixes them with the four tones, saying, "The five tones are yin, yang, rising, departing, and entering. Sharp yang are shang and jiao, departing and entering are zhi and yu, rising is gong. The Han Shu says: 'Tone is rising gong, gong is supreme,' and it is the framework for the four tones, so it can rise from below and is called rising" (see section on the Five Tones Inherent in the Four Tones). This is similar to Li Jiedong of the Northern Qi Dynasty's "Resolving Doubts in Phonology," which associates the names of ancient musical scales with the four tones of spoken language, claiming that "gong and shang are level, zhi is rising, yu is departing, and jiao is entering" (see "Citations from Liu Shan Jing's Discourse on the Four Tones" in "Mirror of Literature and Secret Cabinet"), which is baseless. In ancient times, characters had distinctions in tone but not the names of level, rising, departing, and entering. Therefore, the five tones of gong, shang, jiao, zhi, and yu were used to refer to them, which was originally a borrowed usage, as Chen Lanfu's "Examination of Initial Consonants and Rhymes" has already stated. It is not appropriate to force an association. Zou then confuses the old theories since the Sui and Tang Dynasties, making strained analogies and creating additional errors. The five tones and four tones were originally two different matters, as Shen Yue once said in his letter to Zhen Sibai, the Governor of Dingzhou in the Wei Dynasty. He said:</p>
<p>"The classics and historical records only have five tones and no four tones. So how does the use of four tones harm the five tones? The five tones are gong, shang, jiao, zhi, and yu, which correspond to each other above and below, and the musical sounds are harmonious. If the five relationships of ruler, minister, people, affairs, and things are in harmony, then the country will be well-governed. Those who write five-character poems, if they are good at using the four tones, will be able to create flowing and beautiful recitations and achieve the eight styles, creating splendid and elegant works. Each has its own use and does not interfere with the others." (also see "Discourse on the Four Tones")</p>
<p>This is truly an insightful statement. Furthermore, the division of yin and yang in character sounds is a modern theory. The names of yin and yang as tone categories were created by Yuan Dynasty song and rhyme scholars. Originally, the initial consonants of character sounds had distinctions between clear and muddy, but in later dialects, the initial consonants sometimes did not distinguish between clear and muddy, but the tones had differences between yin and yang. Yin and yang and clear and muddy are originally two different matters. The meaning of yin and yang is also originally not specific. For characters whose initial consonant is a clear consonant, the tone that is read is called the yin tone; for characters whose initial consonant is a muddy consonant, the tone that is read is called the yang tone. This is the case for the level tone, and the same applies to the rising, departing, and entering tones. However, in some dialects, the rising, departing, and entering tones may not distinguish between yin and yang, but this is not always the case. Zou then associates the yin and yang of the level tone with shang and jiao, so what will he do with the yin and yang of the rising and departing tones? Furthermore, because his Xinhua dialect does not distinguish between yin and yang in the rising and departing tones, he claims that the rising and departing tones do not have shang sounds. This is an example of studying local dialects without considering the origins and development.</p>
<p>As for the categories of the twenty initial consonants, they are Zou's deletions and combinations of the theory of initial consonants. He believes that many of the Song scholars' initial consonants are repeated, so he combines xiao with xia, combines qun with xi, combines ding with tou, combines ni with lai, combines yu with ying, combines zhi with zhao, combines che, cheng, and chuang with chuan, combines niang, ri, and chan with shen, combines cong with qing, combines xie with xin, combines bing with pang, and combines feng with fu. Thirty-six initials are combined into sixteen, so there are twenty. However, these are all Zou's own local dialects, how can he use them to discuss ancient people! To say that the ancient sounds of shen and qun should be combined with xiao, that xie should be combined with xu, and that the ancient xu and yi consonants should be read lightly is even more absurd and unreasonable. As for discussing the five tones of the tongue, teeth, throat, etc., he says that the teeth originally have no sound, and their sound is actually the sound of the throat, tongue, teeth, and other sounds. The reason why there is a dental sound in the five tones mentioned by previous people is a general term, not the primary function of one organ. This is again misled by the method of five-tone analysis of characters at the end of Guangyun and the theory of five-tone sounds at the end of the chapter. The method of five-tone analysis of characters uses ga as a dental sound and wang ming as a throat sound. Ga is the jian initial consonant, and gang ge is also the jian initial consonant. The theory of five-tone sounds uses he wo gang e ke kang ge as throat sounds and geng ying ya ge xing xing heng ke as dental sounds. Among them, he is the xia initial consonant, and xing xing is also the xia initial consonant; wo e is the yi initial consonant, and ying ya is also the yi initial consonant; gang diao ge is the jian initial consonant, and geng ge is also the jian initial consonant; kang is the xi initial consonant, and ke is also the xi initial consonant. The boundary between the dental and throat sounds seems to be indistinguishable, so Zou claims that the dental sound is an empty name. If we analyze it carefully, the jade chapter's five-tone sound explanation places first-degree characters in the throat sound and second-degree characters in the teeth sound, and their pronunciations seem to be different, but they are actually not the same type.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the five tones of tongue, teeth, throat, etc., come from the Sanskrit Siddham chapter. The script of Sanskrit is broadly divided into two categories: one is Pīta sound, and the other is atīta sound. Pīta sound is named because it is compared in fives, and all the sounds are consonants produced by exhaling air and touching the mouth, which are controlled by the organs of the mouth. Atīta sound is also called a vowel sound, which is a type of semi-vowel and fricative. Because its sound originates from the throat and fills the mouth, it is also called the sound that fills the mouth. Pīta sounds are divided into five categories according to the different positions of the mouth in producing the sound, which are the so-called five tones. The first category is the ancient root sounds k, kh, g, gh, ng, which are the kind of sounds corresponding to Middle Chinese jian, xi, qun, and yi. The names of these sounds according to Sanskrit grammarians also do not agree with each other. Pratiakbyas calls it the radical sound of the tongue, or translates it as the basic sound of the tongue, or dental sound; Panini calls it the throat sound, or translates it as the middle sound of the throat. However, from the Six Dynasties to the Sui and Tang Dynasties, the Sanskrit monks who came to China were either from Central India or from Southern India, and their languages differed from each other. The throat and teeth were originally one category, but the pronunciation in the dialects was either a throat sound or a dental sound. Therefore, the schools that transmitted Siddham in China also differed. The names of the five tones have their own explanations. (To be continued)</p>
<h3 id="e140">Regarding the Problem of the "" Character in the Stone Drums - An Open Letter to the Editors of Literature and History <a href="#e140" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c140" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">140</a></h3>
<p>— Tang Lan</p>
<p>To the Editors:</p>
<p>Regarding the problem of the "遊" character in the Stone Drums, I received today from the Shanghai Museum the 85th issue of Cultural Relics, which contains Mr. Tong Shuye's article "A Critique of Mr. Tang Lan's Three Doubts about the Use of Characters in the Stone Drums." After reading it, I deeply feel that if two people's thinking and methods are different, they cannot discuss a problem together. For example, I recently only raised the point that the Stone Drums have "" but not "朕" as a basis for the statement "The Stone Drums are definitely not before Duke Jing but after Duke Jing and before the Cursing Chu Texts." First, determine whether this argument is correct or incorrect, and then talk about other things. When talking about other things, there will naturally be other evidence. When I discuss with Mr. Tong, I always want to focus on a preliminary question without digressing. This kind of discussion should be "decisive" and limited to one point without expanding it. This is my method of discussion. Now, Mr. Tong says that I use this point to determine that it was carved in the third year of Duke Ling of Qin, which is not in line with my method. What connection do "" and Duke Ling of Qin have? How can I connect them directly? Mr. Tong has not yet understood my method of discussion, so we do not have a common starting point.</p>
<p>Also, Mr. Tong cites Jiri Jian's "朕余" and Shen Zi Meng's "朕吾." Without discussing whether Jiri Jian's era and Shen Zi Meng's "吾" character are credible, simply "朕余" and "朕吾" are not casually used in my method to replace "朕" or "吾." Their nature, without detailed study, is unknown to me, and it is my method to admit ignorance.</p>
<p>者 according to my knowledge should be read as "dong," not "dong." This is when Prince Yu of Yue went to Ying, Yue Shijia wrote as 與夷, (the Yue Chunqiu mistook 與 for 興). The nineteenth year is the nineteenth year of Goujian, after the capture of the unicorn. Mr. Guo Moruo believes that 諸咎 is wrong. We have seen many bronzes with 諸咎, without a doubt, it came before them. There, there is the word 朕, which does not contradict my saying that the word 朕 disappeared and the word 吾 became popular between the Spring and Autumn and Warring States periods, although Yue culture in different regions may be more conservative. However, after the capture of the unicorn, it can be considered the Warring States period. Mr. Tong may also say that the word 朕 also existed in the Warring States period and that my saying "between the Spring and Autumn and Warring States periods" is "baseless."</p>
<p>The main issue is time and region. Marquis Qi Hou has "朕" but not "" and "" has "" but not "朕." The region is the same, so I believe that the time is different. Marquis Qi Hou is earlier, and "" is later. In the Zhai script, I say that Duke Zhai with the word "朕" is earlier and the Stone Drums with the word "避" are later. This is the same argument. If I misjudge the era of Qin, then that of Qi must also be wrong, because my method is consistent. We may be mistaken about a certain point, and if we are wrong, I am willing to admit it. Only the method cannot be wrong.</p>
<p>But what about Mr. Tong? He says that there are drums in the early Spring and Autumn period, of course, much earlier than Duke Tai of Qin. But in "", he says it is "not far" from Marquis Qi Hou in the time of Duke Jing of Qi. This is a vague statement. Is it earlier? Or later? He says that the era cannot be determined, but he bases it on the 縣 of Marquis Qi Hou and the 邑 of "", saying that the systems are similar. Therefore, he raises another question: "Is it that the use of characters by the people of Qi changed suddenly during this period?" From this, we can know that Mr. Tong also knows that this "difference" is "later," he is just avoiding saying the word "later." Perhaps my thinking is wrong, but I always feel that at this important juncture, at the very least, the right and wrong must be clarified. It should not be "evasive." Since he feels it is later, then it should be frankly later, why say "not far"? What we need to determine is only the order: is the "" character earlier? Or is the "朕" character earlier? This is an important dividing line. How far is a separate matter, and whether there is a sudden change in a short period is also a separate matter. All theories, put them away first, please come to the historical facts. If in fact it has changed suddenly, can we say that the time is too short to allow a sudden change?</p>
<p>In short, according to Mr. Tong Shuye, the use of the character "" in the Stone Drums is much earlier than Duke Mu of Qin who used the word "朕," but the Marquis Qi Hou of the time of Duke Ling of Qi, who was contemporary to Duke Jing of Qin and used the word "朕," is reversed to be before the "" of "". In my method, this is contradictory and absolutely cannot be allowed.</p>
<p>As Mr. Tong said, the Book of Songs uses the word "朕" very little. This may prove that after the end of the Western Zhou Dynasty, the word "朕" gradually lost its momentum in living language, while bronze inscriptions are more conservative, so it was still used in the Spring and Autumn period. But in the same region, there must be a distinction between the "" and "" of Chu who used "吾." Is "朕" earlier? Or are "吾" and "" earlier? What I want to discuss is only this point. Mr. Tong actually admits that the word "朕" is naturally more ancient, which we can agree with 100%, but he still says that the Stone Drums use the character "" in the early Eastern Zhou period, much earlier than Duke Mu of Qin who used the word "朕." This is what we do not understand.</p>
<p>The Book of Songs uses "我" and "余" but not "朕" and "吾." Mr. Tong believes that "朕" is an ancient word, but the Stone Drums use "", "我," and "余" but not "朕" because there is "no need to use 朕." I don't know how Mr. Tong thought of this kind of contradictory statement? Mr. Tong tells us that the Book of Songs' Guofeng does not use the word "朕," so we cannot say it is a work of the Warring States period, so the Stone Drums not using the word "朕" cannot be said to be Warring States. But what about the "吾" character? The Book of Songs has the word "我," but not the word "吾." The Stone Drums have the character "", and also the character "我," and changed "我車旣攻" to "車旣工." Is "吾" earlier than "", and the Stone Drums are still before the Guofeng? Or is the word "吾" newer than the words "我" and "余" and occurred after the Guofeng?</p>
<p>As the saying goes: "Things don't happen more than three times." I have already discussed this issue twice, this is the third time. Further replies will be nothing more than these words, and it will never depart from my old method. Saying more nonsense only wastes your precious space. The truth will one day be proven. Now, since the thinking is different and the methods are different, further discussion will only lead to "the last speaker winning," and there will be no conclusion. Although I am afraid that people will misunderstand my original intention, I am also very afraid that I will misunderstand other people's meanings, and I also hope that Mr. Tong can slowly justify himself, so I have decided to stop here and make this statement that I will not discuss it any further.</p>
<p>Finally, thank you for your kindness in publishing these nonsense words several times.</p>
