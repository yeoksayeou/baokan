<h3 id="c1">閻錫山抵京謁總統　對大局表示非不可挽回　胡宗南同日自陜飛抵京 <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿八日電〕太原綏署閻主任錫山，廿八日下午一時半乘民航大隊專機自幷飛京，省委梁化之及財廳長王平偕行。專機降落大校塲基地，時間較原定抵達時問為早，往迎者均於枉駕後轉赴山西省府駐京辦事處拜候，計有蔣總統代表總統府參軍長孫連仲，孫院長代表政院秘書長端木愷，及賈景德，張羣，吳鐵城，何應欽，徐永昌，郭懺，張鎭等多人。四時，閻氏赴黃埔路官邸晋謁蔣總統，並留共晚餐，至晚十時始辭返省府辦事處，復與張羣密談廿分鐘。旋何成濬及立院院長童冠賢先後往訪，談至十一時半辭出。閻氏卽驅車前往寗海路總統特為準備之旅邸休憩。</p>
<p>〔本報南京廿八日電〕閻錫山將軍抵京後，廿八日晚十一時接見記者，據談：此次來京，係為太原之軍糧民食問題向總統請示，下午晋謁總統後，總統對於援救太原已有明確之答覆與指示，本人在京不擬久留，卽將飛返太原坐鎭。現太原之防務工作已有更週密之準備，相信卽使匪再增加，亦決可保無虞。記者詢以外傳林彪匪部有集結保定岡攻太原模樣是否屬實？閻氏表示尚未接獲是項報告，談及目前國家大局時，閻氏表示一切事在人為，現雖有危機存在，然並非不可挽回，目前最重要者，首為振作軍心，挽回民心，相信剿匪前途仍然樂觀。記者詢其對於近數日來和平謠傳之觀感，閻氏謂：在太原根本未聞有和平之請傳，抵京後雖聞和謠，但和謠之來源殊值注意，恐係有作用之造謠，惟和平係雙方面之事。閻氏並一再堅稱，目前時局並未絕望，一切仍在人為。</p>
<p>〔本報南京廿八日電〕胡宗南將軍廿八日下午四時，由西安乘空軍專機抵南京明故宮機塲。</p>
<p>〔本報南京廿八日電〕由於閻錫山胡宗南等將領之飛集首都，顯示有一關於如何更有效的作戰會議日內將行召集。傳作義總司令為坐鎭北平，或不致來京。據總統府有關軍事人士透露：和談甚難，故今後局勢為如何更堅苦的苦戰。又，林彪所部五縱隊集保定，軍方推測可能西進攻太原或南下攻西安，如此，共匪顯欲實行穩紥打戰法，而非乘機直搗京滬之冒險行徑。</p>
<p>〔又電〕立院全體委員，定廿九日下午四時假國民大會堂二棋大廳舉行茶會，歡迎閻錫山。</p>
<h3 id="c2">向反侵略人士　呼籲有效援助　閻氏聲明決固守太原　指出中共確係馬克斯主義者 <a href="#c2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>〔合衆社本市訊〕堅守孤城太原凡五閱月之太原綏靖主任兼山西省主席閻錫山將軍，廿八日致電合衆社稱：在過去五個月中，渠已擊退共產黨對太原之一切進攻，並保證將繼續作戰到底。</p>
<p>閻氏特別警告誤解中國共產黨思想之美國人士稱：「中共確係為克思主義者，堅信共產主義之文字及精神，遇有機會時卽將其付諸實現」。渠稱：「中國之赤色威脅，實為整個遠東，日本及中國之威脅」。</p>
<p>閻氏綜述太原之局勢及扭轉大局之辦法如下：</p>
<p>「共產黨業已極盡全力，以圖奪取太原，但絕未踏進城關一步，吾人已擊退共軍所能發動之一切攻勢，並己決定繼續固守」。</p>
<p>閻氏向反對極權主義之人士呼籲，有效地援助此一為戰爭所咸脅之地區，渠稱：「事實上，太原已成為赤色海洋中的孤島。」</p>
<p>閻氏舉出五點需要</p>
<p>閻氏並舉出五點需要：由三十五架飛機空運補給，每日往返二次，携帶二百五十噸糧食及五十噸軍事補給，以及供給太原城內工廠生產之五十噸原料，（二）使陳納德將軍領導下美國志願航空隊復活，渠稱：「此間全體人民對陳納德將軍深具信心，並希望當局能給陳將軍以機會，」（按陳納德將軍曾作豪稱，如一旦飛虎隊重行組成，渠將於三日內解太原之圍）（三）在每月中，需要一百五十噸TNT及三十噸無烟火藥，（四）每天需要二百五十噸糧食，（五）「吾人需要山砲，大砲，彈藥及化學武器，因為吾人之兵工廠不能製造此等武器」。</p>
<p>閻氏繼稱：「以上為吾人所需要之補給，但吾人更需要精神上的支持，吾人希望反對侵略之人士能完全瞭解吾人之地位，同情吾人，並給予吾人協助」。</p>
<p>美國人士觀點錯誤</p>
<p>「若干美國人士受共產黨虛偽宣傳的欺騙，認為共產黨將對聯合國全部會員國（包括美國在內）保持友好。因此，認為卽使共產黨控制全中國，亦無須介意，此種希望，實際上不啻為空中樓閣，在八年抗戰之中，當時共軍係由中央政府撥歸本人指揮，我就從共產黨處得到慘痛的經驗，我從經騐中深知共產黨的出爾反爾，言行不符一。</p>
<p>「共產黨認為：一切贅本主義國家均係彼等之仇敵，而認為欺騙仇敵為天經地義之事，因此，便極盡欺騙之能事，他們受有此種訓練，並且將其付諸實施，他們認為：欺騙愈多，可能得到的成功也愈大，並且似乎已得到一種結諭，卽他們的敵人決不致瞭解其眞正的策略」。</p>
<p>「而且，少數人竟謬認中國共產黨非馬克斯主義者，而可能為其中的第二狄托，此項錯誤的觀點，卽由於不悉鐵幕以後的事實之故，但僅須來本省之共軍佔領區訪問一次，卽能獲悉彼等之作一為究竟如何」。</p>
<p>「中國共產黨確係眞正之馬克思主義者，堅信共產主義之文字及精神，遇有機會，卽將其付諸實施，我和共產黨接觸頗多，因此，我完全瞭解他們，因為在抗戰中，我曾經担任過他們的司令官」。</p>
<p>「共產主義的哲學實屬荒謬，在理諭上，共產黨徒認為他們是診治社會病的醫生，但不幸地，他們開出了一貼錯誤的藥方，在病人未得救治之前，却有把病人醫死的危險」。</p>
<p>最後，閻氏並謹祝外界一聖誕快樂，新年幸福」。</p>

<h3 id="c23">離奇謠言·荒誕議論 <a href="#c23" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e23" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">23</a></h3>
<p>前天首都中央日報社論，痛責上海市塲上的和謠，說是巳經變了質，轉化為反政府的宣傳運動，而切望地方政府與治安機關應即肅淸匪諜，斷然處置。這些論斷，原為吾人心理之所同。但是，中央日報有一句話却不免說得大錯特錯了！</p>
<p>首都中央日報說：「任何人都可讓政府倒，只有上海人不能讓政府倒下來」。奇怪極了！我們倒要問：什麽人可以讓政府倒的呢？什麼人又願意讓政府倒的呢？上海人不能讓政府倒，原無待說；難道首都的市民可以讓政府倒嗎？首都的官吏可以讓政府倒嗎？其他省市的人民與官吏可以讓政府倒嗎？而且，上海人又有那幾個在企圖讓政府倒呢？若說指的是匪謀，則匪諜何處無之，又豈獨上海一地？若照首都中央日報社論所謂「任何人都可讓政府倒」的邏輯，那麼別地方的人，甚至速政府的官吏，前綫的軍隊，乃至首都中央日報的記者包括在內，「都可讓政府倒」，只有上海人應該負責來擁護這個「任何人」「可以讓它倒」的政府嗎？事之離奇，言之荒誕，理諭之滑稽，當無過於此！</p>
<p>何况，這些天來的離奇謠言，究竟從那裏來的，大家應該先查個明白。香港固然是製造謠言的地方，但首都恐也是一個謠言「出張所」罷。「光榮和平」的話，是首都要人先說出來的；為什麽要說呢？外國記者先先後後傳述許多要人談話的電報，也是從首都發出來的；為什麽讓他們發呢？連英國外交部也在否認所謂「英法美蘇四國調停」的和謠，更是首都所傳播的；為什麽我們的責任內閣反而沒有一句斬釘截鐵的闢謠談話呢？大家竚待巳久的新內閣，會議復會議，商討復商討，為什麼至今還沒有宣布它的大政方針呢？一切謠言，當然匪諜在散播著，而謠言的根源，却由於政府要人的言行自授以間隙。上海的市塲誠然是敏感的，但政府不自己整肅，不自己檢討，不自己以明快堅決的態度杜絕離奇謠言的根株，却把一切謠言都歸之於上海人，彷彿上海人存心倒政府所以放謠言，那眞是隔靴搔癢之談。</p>
<p>上海市有六百萬的人口，誠不免有敗類混雜，更必然有匪諜潛伏，但上海的市民熱烈奮發勇於自救救國的也有的是，而上海各法團的擁護元首實澈國策，更昭昭為天下人所共見共聞，上海人果何負於國家？新財經政策施行之初，最熱烈繳兌金銀外幣者為上海人，最嚴守限價政策而售貨一空者為上海人，而後來最吃虧最傷元氣者，亦為上海人，但上海人依然勇於慰勞將士，勇於救濟難民，勇於保衛地方，勇於自救教國，上海人果何負於政府？觀乎日內正在開會的市參議會議塲的空氣，上海人的信心與勇氣恐駕他處而上之，那裏有跡象希望政府倒呢？誠如中央日報所說，「上海的繁榮是政府庇護之下造成的；」但也應該知道，中央致府之所以能支持至今，上海人所納鉅額的賦稅不無貢獻了力量罷。我們敢說，至誠擁護中央者，上海當不讓人。</p>
<p>總之，今天我們要使中國免於共產極權之控制，免於淪為「鐵幕」之附席，要使中國人免為國際的奴隸與牛馬，只有愛好自由生活的人民大衆，一齊親愛團結起來，遏止共匪勢力的蔓延。中國人民，個個有責，上海人當然不能例外；然而決不是別的「任何人可以讓政府倒」的。政府果眞要根絕謠言，澄淸視聽，請自肅淸政府中的失敗主義主和份子始。假使不從這點入手，而徒責「姑妄聽之」的上海人，眞是舍本而逐末了。</p>

<h3 id="c43">杜魯門總統發表談話　譴責蘇聯違約行爲　執政期內願覓取美蘇諒解 <a href="#c43" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e43" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">43</a></h3>
<p>〔聯合社米蘇里州甘審斯城廿七日電〕社魯門總統今日在此間宴會中演說，指負蘇聯不遵守協定，妨碍和平之實現。但又稱，蘇聯政府一部份領袖亟望對美諒解。此一偉大盟邦眞有一種似是而非的道義觀念，實堪憂慮，條約在蘇聯政府心目中並不神聖。今後四年內余將致力於對蘇聯各領袖獲得諒解，以確保和平。余對以色列及世界其他種種問題知之有素，所望種種困難，最後均能解決。整個局勢之形成，由於吾戰時一大盟邦不能成立諒解，為世界和平樹立基礎之故。余確信波茨坦與雅爾達所訂任何協定，無一被蘇聯政府遵守·大國人民有此作風，實為隱　。敢信蘇聯人民倘對政府有發言權，則上述各種協定當被遵守。據華盛頓外交界人士稱，杜魯鬥所指蘇聯一部份領袖，殆包括史達林總理與前駐美大使莫洛托夫在內。總統當以親暱口吻稱，史達林為「老喬」，稱其為政治局之俘虜。</p>
<p>〔合衆社電〕述及近東情勢，杜魯門稱，「基督教徒，猶太人與阿拉伯人間殊無有任何異見存在之理由，基督教之基本教義，卽係以公平為原則之摩西教義。」渠繼稱，蘇聯巳成為近東和平道上「絆足之障碍石，」幷謂「整個局勢受一事之影響，卽吾盟國之一未能採取協調能度以促進世界和平。」</p>
<p>〔中央社華盛頓廿七日電〕美國務院對於杜魯門總統指負蘇聯朱能遵守雅爾達及波茨坦協定一點，不願詳加論列。但該院官員曾論及本年十一月該院提交國會公佈蘇聯違約之各種事實，其中有關中國者三·德國者十·韓國者四·羅馬尼亞者二·保加利亞者六·匈牙利者三·奧國者七·波蘭者一。斯時蘇聯曾被指負破壞，並移走東北價值八億五千八百萬美元之工業設備，以日本之武器軍火交付中共，不與中國中央政府以援助，及阻止中國在大連設立行政機關等事</p>
<h3 id="c44">各方面的看法　杜魯門必獲蘇內部裂痕新情報　談話用意殆在試探和平 <a href="#c44" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e44" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">44</a></h3>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓廿八日電〕外交界人士對社魯門總統宣佈若干蘇聯領袖急待瞭解美國之聲明，表示眩惑及興趣。渠等認為總統之談話，顯係暗示大權獨攬之蘇聯政治局委員間發生裂痕，但此間無人能說明此自係情報或外界機構方面獲得之新報告，抑僅係總統電行表示其對克林姆宮內之事務狀態之舊觀點。</p>
<p>第二種解釋係基於總統在六月十一日在奧勒岡州烏琴城對車站羣眾之演說，當時總統曾宣稱，「我對史達林具有好感，但當他達成若干協議而準備信守此等協議之時，他們（指政治局）却不讓他如此」。關於蘇聯領袖分裂的消息，並不新鮮，但許多蘇聯觀察家認為此種分歧，係為個人間而非思想上的。將出任下屆衆院外委會主席之勃魯姆稱，渠亦認為蘇聯國內若干團體希望與美國合作，但渠稱：「控制之政團已採取錯誤之態度，使希望採取正確行動之人民不敢發表渠等本身之思想」。勃氏稱，渠深受杜魯門總統保證將在以後四年中致力與蘇聯達成瞭解之諾言之鼓勵。渠指出：「如蘇聯政府將允許世界保有和平及安全，則唯一之方式卒如杜魯門總統所採取之此種直接提出之表示。」衆院委會委員明斯費爾（民主黨）稱，總統宣稱渠認為和平可能實現，極具有「鼓勵性」。</p>

<p>〔聯合社社漢城廿八日電〕南韓總統李承晚今日稱，南韓美國佔領軍他調，將由其他部隊接防一事，並不影響韓國安全。吾人並不要求特定美軍留韓之數目，僅要求美國在韓留駐相當兵力，以特南韓建軍完成。</p>

<p>〔合衆社開羅廿八日電〕埃及總理諾克拉茜於格林威治時間廿八晨七時五十七分（上海時間下午三時五十七分）被一大學生所暗殺。凶手據警方調查所得，為業遭取締之某回教民族主義派團體之會員，名哈桑，為獸醫大學學生，化裝為埃及警察上尉，面對諾氏連開手槍六發，五彈中的，諾氏當塲身死。</p>
<p>慘案發生地點為埃及內政部電梯傍，僉信前時學生屢有政治示威運動，跡近恐怖行徑，諾氏斷然予以鎭壓，本月初諾氏又下令取締回教兄弟會。此次諾氏之被暗殺，恐係報復云。兄弟會被官方指控煽動學生恐怖行動，而被宣佈為非法組織，其執事人等且被逮捕。據該會自稱擁有會員一百萬人，然實際上恐遠較此數為小。</p>
<p>遇刺經過</p>
<p>諾克拉茜除總理職外，兼任內長財長。據初步報告，諾氏偕侍從長抵內政部前，頎長英俊而年靑之凶手已在部內逗留多時，該部衛兵欲加以查詢，然被另一名賴布之警察所阻。賴布稱，「讓他去，你看，他還是一個警官哩！」諾氏偕侍從長拾級而入，在電梯傍與凶手相遇。凶手舉手行禮後，卽自袋中拔槍射擊，警察稱，凶手當擬舉槍自殺，然在拔動搶機前卽被捕。</p>
<p>諾氏政績</p>
<p>諾氏於一九四六年十二月十日就總理職，素有埃及「硬漢」之稱，一八八八年生於亞歷山大港，前時亦曾一度任總理，執政兩年，頗多重大舉措，諸如英埃絕交等。在其領導下，埃及向聯合國安理會控訴英國，並派埃軍入巴勒斯坦。諾氏被刺消息在開羅傳播極速，警員大批增援內政部，防羣衆騷動。僉料此次謀殺將在倫敦，巴黎，合拉維夫，阿曼及有涉巴勒斯坦糾紛之各國首都，引起莫大之政治反饗。</p>

<p>（五）財政方面：市府經費極端困難，十月份靠中央補貼八百萬元才得勉強渡過，十一月份向國行借貸後始敷衍過去，其艱難情形可以想見。惟市府絕不願增加市民負擔，僅就目前原有稅收項目，促財政局努力徵收之。（六）工務方面：甲，烏鎮路橋今晨舉行通車典禮，這是公務員不貪汚的明證，何以呢？該橋舊定經費為七十二億，今日得以告成，藉售去十萬只洋灰蔴袋所得，如若公務員有汚必食，則洋灰袋大可不必變賣。乙，海塘工程迄今已有相當成績，美方原定撥款卅萬美元充作經費，但目今撥發已生困難，恐將間斷，現正交涉中。丙，中山南路工程，由於當地市民自動拆屋，協助當局完成翻造，實深感謝。</p>
<h3 id="c60">公用事業決予保障 <a href="#c60" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e60" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">60</a></h3>
<p>（七）公用方面：公用局之挨駡時期又將屆臨，因公用事業價格又卽將調整，二個月來外匯煤價不斷增漲，影響成本至鉅，而市府固須顧及市民負擔，但對公用事業又不得不予勉力維持，故對公用事業前途，當局決予確切保障。（八）地政方面：由於時局緊張，業主紛欲取執契紙，致地政局工作頓形繁忙，而各界對該局之批評，一致認為過慢。本人曾親赴該局視察，研究其緩慢之原因，得知二年來該局收到契紙十二三萬件，已發出者十萬件，尚有二萬未及趕竣，而其中有三千件因手續證件種種不符無法辦理者。為杜絕流弊起見，希望參議員發現有弊端者，可予檢舉，市府決予澈查究辦。（九）衛生方面：甲，本市防疫工作推進成績可以注射數字表現，本年度經衛生局注射霍亂者計二百六十一萬人，天花二百三十六萬人，本年疫病所以未見流行，實非無功。乙，淸除垃圾問題嚴重，本市人口比戰前增加一倍，而淸道夫减少四分之一，最近又因戒嚴時間關係，蘇州河道擁塞不堪，妨碍垃圾船隻航行，現當局正設法疏導中。</p>
<h3 id="c61">參議員提質詢 <a href="#c61" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e61" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">61</a></h3>
<p>參議員紛提質詢：（一）王立本：中小教師總請假後，除每人配得絨綫一磅外，餘均未兌現。沒收之封存物資何不變價分配。（二）張中原：普善山莊工作成績優良，現經費極端困難，請市府補助。（三）費樹聲：十一月戶口米配價訂得過高，足以影響物價上漲。又最近公用事業漲價太高，是何根據？又際此嚴重局勢之下，身為市長者是否將堅守上海似應有明確之表示。（四）張學濂：新發之國民身份證，附有配購證一四四張，迄未兌現，為何？（五）特殊份子擠兌黃金，散兵游勇強銷毛巾，當局亟應制止。（六）江浩然：以前用電過度所繳罰款法幣一千億元，原定作警備旅之用，現在何處？（七）丁善明：郊區最近開到大批軍隊，當局應設法增加其副食費。（八）黃炳權：戡建大隊隊員強佔民房應禁止。（九）張志韓：揚子公司物資如何處理？（十）嚴諤聲：當局對購儲糧食，燃料必須求其充分，對自衛工作亦應注意。（十一）姜豪：橋頭乞丐充塞，亟應設法收容。（十二）童襄：擠兌金銀時，警察隨意打人，亟應制止。（十三）瞿鉞：按照中央規定，黃金不准自由賣買，則兌金等於買古董，辦法顯係不通，地方應有權加以修正，然後施行。（十四）處舜：江亞輪慘案，市府應盡力善其後。（十五）朱樹鑑：本市難民太多，應速為收容。</p>

<p>吳市長答覆質詢如下：（一）中小教師配給品，捲烟食油卽可分配，但手續尚須社會局與各公會協商決定。（二）對普善山莊在可能範圍中可予補貼。（三）美援米並非救濟米，價格無法過低。公用事業漲價，儘可公開審查賬册。本人係地方首級文職官員，共黨昨日發表黑名單時，本人業已列入，對是否能留守上海一點，似可不必懷疑。（四）新國民身份證之配物證，乃經濟督導員辦公處所訂，市府無法負責。（五）特殊份子擠兌黃金，及散兵游勇強銷貨物，當請警備部嚴加取締。（六）法幣一千億之罰款，業由公用局充作購置路燈材料之用。（七）郊區駐軍副食費當建議國防部發給實物。（八）戡建大隊隊員強佔民房，當由警備部制止。（九）揚子案件，一原由經濟督導員辦公處主管，辦公處撤銷後，本人卽令社會局依法律處理之。（十）儲存糧食及燃料問題，當局亦極為注意，正設法充實中。（十一）街頭乞丐卽可開始收容。（十二）警察毆打兌金者，以後保證可不再發生。（十三）兌金辦法係中央所訂，地方政府僅能貢獻參攷意見。（十四）江亞輪慘案市府必儘力協助善後。（十五）救濟難民工作正積積展開中。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕市總工會昨舉行理監事例會，討論要案多起，（一）最近各保甲徵收志願兵安家費，漫無標準，自數斗米值至數石米值不等，工人不勝負担，決議凡適齡壯丁戶以二斗值為原則，無適齡壯丁戶以不超過一斗米值為原則，米價以配給價計算。（二）市社會局於本市米荒時，曾借食米與各工廠，以配給工人，現社局催歸還食米，工會方面希折現歸還，並決定由周理事長學湘赴社局謁吳局長面商，希准折現歸還，折價不超過配給價。（三）現生活指數編製公式中，房租一項仍依改革幣制前之舊標準計算，而事實上改革幣制後在限價時期及限價開放以後，房租多經數度調整，房租在指數中所佔百分率甚大，若不速予更正，影響指數必鉅，決議請工界參議員在參議會中提出，請予改訂標準，以免工人無形中吃虧。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕今日為淸華大學校長梅貽琦六秩基誕，該校在滬校友趁梅校長來滬之便，特於昨日下午六時在九江路淸華同學會聚餐，為梅校長祝壽，到校友黎照實，孫瑞璜·沈宗濂·夏堅白·向哲濬·李健吾等一百六十餘人。梅校長偕其弟梅貽竇等蒞會參加，全體校友高唱〔祝壽歌」，並獻贈在滬校友簽名紀念册以示敬意。各校友對政府發表梅氏出長教部及母校在戰火中情形，極表關切，梅校長特於席間作詳盡報告。渠表示此次南來，係爲北方各校員生設法，非為做官，且個人才力經騐不够，亦係事實，故對政府發表出長教部事，辭意堅決，已請政府早日另選賢能，以免部務久懸。渠本人本不擬南來，因邯鄲廣播電合，曾有一旦「解放」後，本人仍將留任校長之消息，為避免外界不明眞相起見，故於二十一日隨機南下。</p>
<p>關於淸華園情形，梅校長稱：當本月十二日，渠尚認為時局不致劇變，詎知十三日，突聞槍砲聲，同時且有一廚子被流彈擊傷。渠本人於十四日入城探聽消息，此後卽因無法通過城門，迄未回校。及至十六日，電話聯絡亦告中斷。後有外籍三教授進城，據稱學校所在地已成「解放區」，但共軍未進入校內，校內情形頗為安定。至今員生進城者，祗有教授二十餘名及學生一百餘名，胥由北大貸款發薪並准學生住校借讀。現留淸華園者，尚有學生二千餘名及教職員與眷屬七八百名。關於物資方面，因校方備有麵粉近四千袋，加以私人所存，至少可維持一個月之需。據入城之外籍教授言，現已可能恢復上課。至外傳會有淸華學生十餘名在進城途中被流彈擊傷之說，則無法證實，恐係謠言。現抵京各校負責人，在教部協助下，已成立平津國立院校駐京聯合辦事處，如天氣轉佳，將派機接運各校員生南來，設法安頓云。據悉：梅校長定今明日內卽行返京。</p>

<p>日來本市物價漲勢，有增無巳。商品價格，一日教變，人心恐慌，不可終日。是項現象，一般均歸咎於政府宣佈暫停金銀存兌之故，惟據金融管理負責人稱：此項漲風之主要原因，還在游資擁寒心與理作崇，加以若干投機者從中興風作浪，有以致之。彼指出最近來自北方之游資。為數至鉅；加以徐蚌會戰開始之初，本市南逃資金，日來又有一部流轉來滬，致使此實銷淸淡之商品市塲，掀起超越）常軌之漲風。彼謂當局對此已在擬定一項縝密之對策，是項新對策之重心，將着重於誘導游資，及抽緊銀根兩點。彼並指出，值此去化呆滯之際，一旦拆息高升，將迫便一般投機囤積者知難而退。</p>
<p>〔又訊〕據金融管理局負責人稱：該局為安定市面，平抑物價漲風，刻正與中央銀行方面治商誘導游資之有效辦法。同時對金鈔黑市及銀元高價買賣之取締，亦經會同市警察局等有關機構，着手進行，</p>
<p>平津游資，大量逃滬，洶涌異常，據官方統計，月來由北方匯來款項，每日幾達一億左有。致市而銀根鬆濫異常，游資到處興風作浪，物價大受影響。當局對此確至為重視，正迅謀解決中，央行劉攻芸昨對記者表示，短期國庫券將大量發行，並將設法解決上市問題，至前稱之公司債問題，央行現已考慮發行中</p>

<h3 id="e1">Yan Xishan Arrives in Nanjing to Meet the President, Expressing That the Overall Situation Is Not Irretrievable; Hu Zongnan Arrives in Nanjing from Shaanxi on the Same Day by Plane <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 28th Dispatch] Yan Xishan, Director of the Taiyuan Pacification Headquarters, arrived in Nanjing at 1:30 PM on the 28th, flying from Taiyuan on a special plane of the Civil Aviation Corps, accompanied by Liang Huazhi, Secretary of the Provincial Committee, and Wang Ping, Director of the Finance Department. The special plane landed at the Daxiaochang Air Base, earlier than the originally scheduled arrival time. Those who came to welcome him, after making a fruitless trip, went to the Beijing Office of the Shanxi Provincial Government to pay their respects, including Sun Lianzhong, Chief Military Aide of the Presidential Office representing President Chiang; Duanmu Kai, Secretary-General of the Executive Yuan representing President Sun; and Jia Jingde, Zhang Qun, Wu Tiecheng, He Yingqin, Xu Yongchang, Guo Chan, Zhang Zhen, and many others. At 4:00 PM, Yan visited President Chiang at his official residence on Huangpu Road and stayed for dinner. He returned to the Provincial Government Office in Beijing at 10:00 PM and had a secret talk with Zhang Qun for 20 minutes. Subsequently, He Chengjun and Tong Guanxian, President of the Legislative Yuan, visited him one after another, leaving at 11:30 PM. Yan then drove to the residence specially prepared for him by the President on Ninghai Road to rest.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 28th Dispatch] After General Yan Xishan arrived in Nanjing, he met with reporters at 11:00 PM on the 28th. According to him, his visit to Nanjing was to request instructions from the President regarding the military food and civilian rations problem in Taiyuan. After meeting with the President in the afternoon, the President gave a clear answer and instructions regarding the rescue of Taiyuan. He did not intend to stay in Nanjing for long and would fly back to Taiyuan to take charge. The defense work of Taiyuan has been more thoroughly prepared, and he believed that even if the bandits increased their forces, it would be safe. When asked by reporters whether the rumors that Lin Biao's bandit troops were gathering in Baoding and attacking Taiyuan were true, Yan said that he had not received such a report. When talking about the current national situation, Yan said that everything depends on human effort. Although there is a crisis, it is not irretrievable. The most important thing at present is to boost military morale and regain popular support. He believed that the future of suppressing the bandits is still optimistic. When reporters asked about his views on the recent rumors of peace, Yan said that he had not heard of any calls for peace in Taiyuan at all. Although he heard of peace rumors after arriving in Nanjing, the source of the rumors is worth noting, and he feared that they were rumors created with a purpose. However, peace is a two-sided matter. Yan repeatedly insisted that the current situation is not hopeless, and everything still depends on human effort.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 28th Dispatch] General Hu Zongnan arrived at Ming Palace Airport in Nanjing at 4:00 PM on the 28th, flying from Xi'an on a special air force plane.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 28th Dispatch] The flying of generals such as Yan Xishan and Hu Zongnan to the capital shows that a meeting on how to conduct more effective combat will be convened in the coming days. It is said that Commander-in-Chief Fu Zuoyi will stay in Beiping and may not come to Nanjing. According to military officials in the Presidential Office, peace talks are difficult, so the future situation will be an even more arduous and bitter battle. Furthermore, the military speculated that the 5th Column of Lin Biao's troops gathered in Baoding might advance westward to attack Taiyuan or southward to attack Xi'an. In this way, the Communist bandits clearly want to implement a steady and secure fighting method, rather than an adventurous act of directly attacking Nanjing and Shanghai by taking advantage of the opportunity.</p>
<p>[Another Dispatch] All members of the Legislative Yuan are scheduled to hold a tea party at 4:00 PM on the 29th in the Second Chess Hall of the National Assembly Hall to welcome Yan Xishan.</p>
<h3 id="e2">Appealing for Effective Assistance to Anti-Aggression Individuals; Yan's Statement Determines to Defend Taiyuan; Pointing out That the Chinese Communist Party Is Indeed Marxist <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>[United Press, This City Dispatch] General Yan Xishan, Director of the Taiyuan Pacification Headquarters and Chairman of Shanxi Province, who has defended the isolated city of Taiyuan for five months, sent a telegram to United Press on the 28th, saying: In the past five months, he has repelled all attacks by the Communist Party on Taiyuan and guaranteed to continue fighting to the end.</p>
<p>Yan especially warned American people who misunderstand the ideology of the Chinese Communist Party, saying: "The CCP is indeed a Marxist, firmly believes in the words and spirit of communism, and will put it into practice when the opportunity arises." He said: "The red threat in China is a threat to the entire Far East, Japan, and China."</p>
<p>Yan summarized the situation in Taiyuan and the way to reverse the situation as follows:</p>
<p>"The Communist Party has done everything possible to capture Taiyuan, but has never stepped into the city gate. We have repelled all offensives that the Communist army can launch and have decided to continue to defend it."</p>
<p>Yan appealed to those who oppose totalitarianism to effectively assist this war-threatened area. He said: "In fact, Taiyuan has become an isolated island in a red ocean."</p>
<p>Yan Lists Five Needs</p>
<p>Yan also listed five needs: (1) Supplies should be airlifted by 35 aircraft, flying back and forth twice a day, carrying 250 tons of food and 50 tons of military supplies, as well as 50 tons of raw materials for the factories in Taiyuan City to produce; (2) Revive the American Volunteer Air Force under the leadership of General Chennault. He said: "All the people here have great confidence in General Chennault and hope that the authorities can give General Chen a chance." (Note: General Chennault once boasted that if the Flying Tigers were reorganized, he would relieve the siege of Taiyuan within three days.) (3) 150 tons of TNT and 30 tons of smokeless gunpowder are needed every month; (4) 250 tons of food are needed every day; (5) "We need mountain guns, artillery, ammunition, and chemical weapons, because our arsenals cannot manufacture these weapons."</p>
<p>Yan continued: "The above are the supplies we need, but we need more spiritual support. We hope that those who oppose aggression can fully understand our position, sympathize with us, and give us assistance."</p>
<p>American People's Viewpoints Are Wrong</p>
<p>"Some American people have been deceived by the CCP's false propaganda, believing that the Communist Party will maintain friendly relations with all members of the United Nations (including the United States). Therefore, they believe that even if the Communist Party controls all of China, there is no need to care. This kind of hope is actually just a castle in the air. During the eight years of the War of Resistance Against Japan, when the Communist army was assigned to my command by the central government, I learned a painful lesson from the Communist Party. I know from experience that the Communist Party goes back on its word and does not match its words with its actions.</p>
<p>"The Communist Party believes that all capitalistic countries are their enemies, and that deceiving enemies is a matter of course. Therefore, they do everything possible to deceive. They are trained in this and put it into practice. They believe that the more deception, the more success they can achieve, and they seem to have come to a conclusion that their enemies will never understand their true strategy."</p>
<p>"Moreover, a few people mistakenly believe that the Chinese Communist Party is not a Marxist and may be a second Tito. This erroneous view is due to ignorance of the facts behind the Iron Curtain. But just a visit to the Communist-occupied areas of this province will reveal what they are doing."</p>
<p>"The Chinese Communist Party is indeed a true Marxist, firmly believes in the words and spirit of communism, and will put it into practice when the opportunity arises. I have had a lot of contact with the Communist Party, so I fully understand them, because I once served as their commander during the War of Resistance Against Japan."</p>
<p>"The philosophy of communism is absurd. In theory, the communists believe that they are doctors who diagnose social diseases. But unfortunately, they prescribe the wrong medicine. Before the patient is saved, there is a risk of killing the patient."</p>
<p>Finally, Yan wished everyone a "Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year."</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, Beiping, 28th Dispatch] The ancient city has passed half a month in the flames of war. The citizens are calm and their lives are normal, but the wartime scenes that have arisen due to the needs of the war are gradually increasing. Defense works have been built in the streets and alleys, and the airport in the city is filled with smoke. The fuselage scrapes the rooftops, shaking people's hearts. The large glass windows of shops, residences, and organs are covered with white strips of paper to prevent them from being shattered. The paper strips in the shop windows of large stores are painted with artistic patterns, creating a strong contrast between war and peace with the displayed goods. Dongdan, Qianmen, and Wangfujing are still crowded with people every afternoon, bustling like shuttles. Cinemas, Peking opera theaters, and variety shows are booming.

<p>[Our Newspaper, Bengbu, 28th Dispatch] According to sources: Senior officials of the Xuzhou Pacification Headquarters stationed in Bengbu will not leave for the time being. Commander-in-Chief Liu Zhi and Deputy Commanders Li Yannian and Liu Ruming are all in Bengbu.</p>
<p>[Another Dispatch] Military News: Regarding Du Yuming's army group, at present, in addition to the slightly difficult living conditions of the officers and soldiers, there are unlikely to be other problems in combat in the short term.</p>
<p>[Another Dispatch] The snow in northern Anhui has stopped and the sky is overcast. The air force of the Nanjing base has begun to airdrop supplies to the three army groups of Du Yuming. According to the flight personnel, the war there is quiet, and both sides of the position are covered with white snow, a silver light, which is quite a quiet atmosphere. According to the General Suppression Headquarters' announcement today, in the recent Bengbu-Suzhou battlefield, there have been only outpost battles on the north and south lines.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 28th Dispatch] The snow in northern Anhui has stopped and the sky is overcast. In order to support Du Yuming's troops in the Xiaoxian-Yongcheng area, the air force dispatched a large number of transport planes to fly over the stationed area of Du's troops in Qinglongji, circling and waiting for the ground airdrop circle revealed by the cloud holes, and quickly diving to airdrop food and ammunition. Every transport plane has received strict orders from Commander-in-Chief Zhou Zhirou that the task must be accomplished, so the fuel tanks are exhausted when returning to land. Military sources pointed out that the rear comfort from the Comfort Association is far less effective than immediately handing over all kinds of dry food that can be eaten to the Joint Logistics Headquarters for airdrop support to Du's troops. The effect of this comfort achievement is better than forming 100,000 new troops to defend the Huai River.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Bengbu, 27th Dispatch] The Suppression Headquarters announced: (1) There are no scattered bandits on both sides of the Bengbu-Pukou Railway, and traffic has completely resumed. (2) Our army has completed a new deployment. Our Du and Li army groups are still in their original defense towns, confronting the bandits without fierce fighting.</p>

Mr. Tong then delivered a brief speech, stating: "I am deeply apprehensive about being elected President by the love and support of my colleagues. In the future, I will uphold a spirit of sincerity and frankness to bear the responsibilities entrusted by the Constitution. The Legislative Yuan represents the people of the whole country, and the more than seven hundred committee members should jointly bear responsibility for all matters. The country is currently in a time of crisis, with flames of war raging everywhere and the people living in misery. Colleagues in the Legislative Yuan should feel a shared sense of concern and work together to overcome all difficulties and forge a bright future." Vice President Liu Jianqun then delivered a speech, saying that after being elected, he would accept everyone's guidance, do his best to take responsibility, and assist President Tong in handling the Yuan's affairs. He also shared eight characters with the audience to encourage each other, namely, "Complete harmony, full efficiency." He continued, "We are now in a time of turmoil, and everyone feels extremely uneasy. Only by working together in harmony can we turn danger into safety, so 'harmony is essential.' At the same time, we should also be vigilant and improve efficiency, so as to give full play to the greatest strength of the Legislative Yuan. If these two things can be done, we will surely have boundless joy."

<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 28th] The Legislative Yuan passed the "Regulations on Salt Tax Collection" at its plenary session on the 28th, changing the salt tax to ad valorem collection and adopting the principle of differential tax rates to equalize the burden on people in various regions. The full text of the regulations consists of five articles, the main points of which are: calculating the tax rate based on the average salt price at important locations in each production and sales region across the country, deducting the actual required cost after reducing the original tax amount, and dividing the tax rates into three categories according to their uses: A. Edible salt and sea salt are taxed at 70%, well salt is taxed at 10% within Guizhou Province, and generally taxed at 30%, and earth salt and gypsum salt are taxed at 20%. B. Fishing salt is taxed at 5%, but salt for industrial and agricultural use is tax-exempt.</p>

<h3 id="e23">Bizarre Rumors · Absurd Arguments <a href="#e23" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c23" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">23</a></h3>
<p>The editorial of the Central Daily News in the capital city the day before yesterday severely criticized the rumors in the Shanghai market, saying that they had become qualitatively changed, transformed into an anti-government propaganda movement, and hoped that the local government and security agencies would immediately clear out the bandits and spies and deal with them decisively. These arguments are in line with what we feel in our hearts. However, one sentence in the Central Daily News is completely wrong!</p>
<p>The Capital Central Daily News said: "Anyone can let the government fall, only Shanghainese cannot let the government fall." How strange! We want to ask: Who can let the government fall? And who wants to let the government fall? It goes without saying that Shanghainese cannot let the government fall; can the citizens of the capital let the government fall? Can the officials of the capital let the government fall? Can the people and officials of other provinces and cities let the government fall? Moreover, how many Shanghainese are trying to let the government fall? If it refers to bandit conspiracies, then there are bandits and spies everywhere, not just in Shanghai. If, according to the logic of the editorial of the Capital Central Daily News that "anyone can let the government fall," then people from other places, even the officials of the government, the troops on the front line, and even the reporters of the Capital Central Daily News, are included, "all can let the government fall," and only Shanghainese should be responsible for supporting this government that "anyone" "can let it fall"? Nothing can be more bizarre in substance, more absurd in words, and more comical in argument than this!</p>
<p>Moreover, where did these bizarre rumors of the past few days come from? Everyone should first investigate and find out. Hong Kong is certainly a place for fabricating rumors, but the capital city is probably also a rumor "branch office." The words "glorious peace" were first spoken by important people in the capital city; why were they spoken? Foreign reporters have successively transmitted many telegrams of conversations with important people, which were also sent from the capital city; why were they allowed to send them? Even the British Foreign Office is denying the rumor of "mediation by the four countries of Britain, France, the United States, and the Soviet Union," which was also spread by the capital city; why doesn't our responsible cabinet have a single unequivocal statement to refute the rumors? The new cabinet, which everyone has been waiting for for a long time, has held meeting after meeting, discussing and discussing, why hasn't it announced its major policy? All rumors are certainly spread by bandits and spies, but the source of the rumors is that the words and deeds of government officials have given them an opportunity. The Shanghai market is indeed sensitive, but if the government does not rectify itself, does not reflect on itself, and does not take a clear and resolute attitude to eradicate the roots of bizarre rumors, but attributes all the rumors to Shanghainese, as if Shanghainese deliberately want to overthrow the government and therefore spread rumors, that is truly missing the point.</p>
<p>The city of Shanghai has a population of six million, and it is inevitable that there will be dregs mixed in, and even more inevitable that there will be bandits and spies lurking, but there are also many citizens of Shanghai who are enthusiastic, enterprising, and brave in saving themselves and the country. Moreover, the support of Shanghai's various legal organizations for the head of state and the implementation of national policies is clearly seen and heard by everyone in the world. What has Shanghai done to betray the country? At the beginning of the implementation of the new financial policy, the Shanghainese were the most enthusiastic in paying gold, silver, and foreign currencies, and the Shanghainese were the most strict in adhering to the price limit policy and selling out their goods. However, the Shanghainese were also the ones who suffered the most and lost the most vitality later. But the Shanghainese are still brave in consoling the soldiers, brave in rescuing refugees, brave in defending the local area, and brave in saving themselves and the country. What has Shanghai done to betray the government? Looking at the atmosphere of the City Council meeting currently being held these days, the confidence and courage of the Shanghainese probably surpass those of other places, and there are no signs of hoping for the government to fall. As the Central Daily News said, "Shanghai's prosperity was created under the protection of the government;" but it should also be known that the huge amount of taxes paid by Shanghainese has contributed to the government's ability to sustain itself until now. We dare to say that Shanghai will not let others surpass it in sincerely supporting the central government.</p>
<p>In short, today, if we want to prevent China from being controlled by communist totalitarianism, from becoming an appendage of the "Iron Curtain," and to prevent Chinese people from becoming international slaves and cattle, we can only have the masses of people who love a free life unite together in solidarity to curb the spread of communist bandits' forces. Every Chinese person has a responsibility, and Shanghainese are certainly no exception; however, it is definitely not that other "anyone can let the government fall." If the government really wants to eradicate rumors and clarify public opinion, please start by purging the defeatist and pro-peace elements in the government. If we don't start from this point, but blame the Shanghainese who "just listen to it," we are truly abandoning the fundamentals and pursuing the superficial.</p>

<h3 id="e43">President Truman Delivers Speech Condemning Soviet Violation of Agreements; Willing to Seek Understanding Between the U.S. and the Soviet Union During His Term <a href="#e43" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c43" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">43</a></h3>
<p>[United Press International, Kansas City, Missouri, 27th] President Truman, in a speech at a banquet here today, accused the Soviet Union of failing to comply with agreements and obstructing the realization of peace. However, he also stated that some leaders of the Soviet government were eager for understanding with the United States. It is worrying that this great ally has a seemingly self-contradictory moral concept. Treaties are not sacred in the eyes of the Soviet government. In the next four years, I will devote myself to gaining understanding with the Soviet leaders in order to ensure peace. I am well aware of the various problems in Israel and the rest of the world, and I hope that all difficulties can eventually be resolved. The entire situation has arisen because one of our great wartime allies has failed to establish an understanding and lay the foundation for world peace. I am certain that no agreement reached in Potsdam and Yalta has been adhered to by the Soviet government. Such behavior by the people of a great power is a hidden danger. I am confident that if the Soviet people had a say in the government, the aforementioned agreements would be observed. According to diplomatic sources in Washington, the Soviet leaders referred to by Truman likely include Premier Stalin and former Ambassador to the United States Molotov. The President affectionately referred to Stalin as "Old Joe" and described him as a prisoner of the Politburo.</p>
<p>[Associated Press] Speaking of the situation in the Near East, Truman said, "There is no reason for any disagreement between Christians, Jews, and Arabs. The basic doctrine of Christianity is based on the Mosaic doctrine of fairness." He continued, saying that the Soviet Union had become a "stumbling block" in the path of peace in the Near East, and said, "The entire situation is affected by one thing, that one of our allies has failed to adopt a coordinated approach to promote world peace."</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 27th] The U.S. State Department declined to comment in detail on President Truman's accusation that the Soviet Union had failed to comply with the Yalta and Potsdam agreements. However, officials from the department discussed the various facts of Soviet violations published in a report submitted to Congress in November of this year, including three related to China, ten to Germany, four to Korea, two to Romania, six to Bulgaria, three to Hungary, seven to Austria, and one to Poland. At that time, the Soviet Union was accused of destruction and removal of industrial equipment worth $858 million from the Northeast, providing weapons and ammunition captured from Japan to the Chinese Communists, failing to provide assistance to the Chinese central government, and preventing China from establishing administrative agencies in Dalian.</p>
<h3 id="e44">Views from Various Quarters: Truman Must Have Obtained New Intelligence on Internal Rifts in the Soviet Union; Purpose of Speech Likely to Probe for Peace <a href="#e44" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c44" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">44</a></h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 28th] Diplomatic sources expressed bewilderment and interest in President Truman's statement that some Soviet leaders are eager to understand the United States. They believe that the President's remarks clearly imply a rift among the members of the all-powerful Soviet Politburo, but no one here can say whether this is new information obtained from intelligence agencies or outside sources, or merely the President's expression of his old views on the state of affairs within the Kremlin.</p>
<p>The second interpretation is based on the President's speech to crowds at a train station in Umatilla, Oregon on June 11th, when the President declared, "I am fond of Stalin, but when he reaches some agreements and is ready to abide by them, they (referring to the Politburo) do not allow him to do so." News of divisions among Soviet leaders is not new, but many Soviet observers believe that these differences are personal rather than ideological. Blum, who will become chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee in the next term, said that he also believes that some groups in the Soviet Union want to cooperate with the United States, but he said: "The controlling faction has adopted the wrong attitude, making it impossible for people who want to take the right action to express their own ideas." Blum said he was deeply encouraged by President Truman's promise to work towards an understanding with the Soviet Union in the next four years. He pointed out: "If the Soviet government will allow the world to maintain peace and security, the only way to do so is through direct expressions like the one taken by President Truman." Minsfield (Democrat), a member of the House Committee, said that the President's declaration that he believes peace is possible is extremely "encouraging."</p>

<p>13 Million People Detained</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Berlin, 27th] U.S. Secretary of the Army Royall, who had visited England, France, Germany, Italy, Greece, Turkey, and Austria in the past three weeks, left here today to return to the United States. Before leaving, he said that according to reliable information, there are currently 13 million people detained in Soviet concentration camps, excluding German prisoners of war, including 9 million Russians and another 2 million Germans.</p>

<p>[Associated Press, Moscow, 28th] The Soviet Army's mouthpiece, "Red Star," reminded the Soviet Army in an editorial on the 28th that Stalin had warned, "As long as capitalist encirclement exists, the danger of wars of aggression and attacks on the Soviet Union will always exist."</p>

<p>Announced by South Korean President Syngman Rhee</p>
<p>[United Press International, Seoul, 28th] South Korean President Syngman Rhee said today that the transfer of U.S. occupation forces in South Korea, which will be replaced by other troops, will not affect Korean security. We do not ask for a specific number of U.S. troops to remain in Korea, but only that the United States maintain a substantial force in Korea until South Korea completes its military buildup.</p>
<p>[United Press International, Tokyo, 28th] Here, after discovering soldiers of the U.S. 7th Division, it was learned that a portion of the U.S. military has withdrawn from Korea. The 7th Division was stationed near the 38th parallel shortly after Japan surrendered. It has been rumored for months that the 11th Airborne Division will be replaced by one of the two U.S. divisions stationed in Korea, and the other division remaining in Korea is the 6th Infantry Division.</p>
<h3 id="e48">Egyptian Prime Minister Nokrashy Assassinated; Assassin Named Hassan, Member of Muslim Brotherhood <a href="#e48" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c48" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">48</a></h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Cairo, 28th] Egyptian Prime Minister Nokrashy was assassinated by a university student at 7:57 AM Greenwich Mean Time on the 28th (3:57 PM Shanghai time). According to police investigations, the assassin, named Hassan, is a member of a Muslim nationalist group that has been banned. He is a veterinary student who disguised himself as an Egyptian police captain and fired six shots at Nokrashy at close range, hitting him with five bullets. Nokrashy died on the spot.</p>
<p>The tragic incident occurred near the elevator of the Egyptian Ministry of Interior. It is believed that students have repeatedly engaged in political demonstrations that bordered on terrorism. Nokrashy resolutely suppressed them. Earlier this month, Nokrashy also ordered the ban of the Muslim Brotherhood. The assassination of Nokrashy is likely a retaliatory act. The Brotherhood has been accused by the government of inciting students to engage in terrorist activities and has been declared an illegal organization, and its leaders have been arrested. The Brotherhood claims to have one million members, but the actual number is likely much smaller.</p>
<p>Details of the Assassination</p>
<p>In addition to serving as Prime Minister, Nokrashy also served as Minister of Interior and Minister of Finance. According to preliminary reports, when Nokrashy and his adjutant arrived at the Ministry of Interior, the tall, handsome, and young assassin had been loitering in the ministry for some time. Guards wanted to question him, but were stopped by another police officer named Rab, who said, "Let him go, look, he is an officer!" Nokrashy and his adjutant went up the steps and encountered the assassin near the elevator. The assassin saluted and then drew a gun from his bag and fired. Police said the assassin intended to commit suicide, but was arrested before pulling the trigger.</p>
<p>Nokrashy's Achievements</p>
<p>Nokrashy took office as Prime Minister on December 10, 1946, and was known as the "tough guy" of Egypt. He was born in Alexandria in 1888 and had previously served as Prime Minister for a period of two years, during which he took many major measures, such as severing relations between Britain and Egypt. Under his leadership, Egypt filed a complaint against Britain with the United Nations Security Council and sent Egyptian troops into Palestine. News of Nokrashy's assassination spread rapidly in Cairo, and police reinforcements were dispatched to the Ministry of Interior to prevent public unrest. It is expected that the assassination will cause a great political reaction in London, Paris, Tel Aviv, Amman, and the capitals of countries involved in the Palestinian conflict.</p>
<h3 id="e49">Security Council Orders the Immediate Release of the Indonesian President and Political Prisoners; Soviet Proposal for Ceasefire and Troop Withdrawal Rejected <a href="#e49" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c49" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">49</a></h3>
<p>[This newspaper reported] Paris, 28th Broadcast: The Security Council has ordered the Netherlands to "immediately" release the Indonesian President and other political prisoners and report on the progress within 24 hours. A proposal submitted by China requesting the Dutch government to release Indonesian political prisoners was passed with eight votes in favor and zero votes against (Britain, France, and Belgium abstained).</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Paris, 77th] The United Nations Security Council on the 27th rejected a Soviet proposal to order the Netherlands to withdraw its troops in Indonesia to their positions before the outbreak of hostilities eight days ago. The Soviet proposal received only five votes in favor, but required seven votes to pass. Last week, abstentions by the Soviet Union and France led to the failure of a similar U.S. proposal.</p>
<p>The five countries that supported the proposal were China, the Soviet Union, Ukraine, Colombia, and Syria. The United States, Britain, France, Canada, Belgium, and Argentina all abstained. A Soviet proposal to order the Netherlands to cease fire within 24 hours also failed to pass, with only four votes in favor. Colombia abstained this time. U.S. Representative Jessup, commenting on the East-West rivalry in the Security Council, said: "I do not wish to place other delegations in a false position. The U.S. position on the Indonesian issue is clear to the world." Ukrainian Representative Tarasenko declared: "Without U.S. financial assistance, the Netherlands would not have been able to launch the Indonesian war. The U.S. government cannot escape responsibility." Soviet Representative Malik, after the vote, made a brief and sharp statement: "It is very clear that Britain and the United States want to avoid taking effective action." Earlier, when the Dutch representative refused to inform the Security Council whether the Dutch government would comply with the ceasefire order of the 24th, Malik proposed ordering the Netherlands to cease fire within 24 hours and withdraw its troops to their original positions before the current "police action." Colombia also submitted a proposal, which will be discussed on the 28th, to order the current mediation committee in Indonesia to report to the Security Council on compliance with the 24th ceasefire order. The proposal will also instruct the mediation committee to report on "the situation in areas currently under military occupation, or the situation in areas where the occupying forces can currently withdraw."</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 28th] The Chinese delegation to the Security Council this morning submitted a motion on the Indonesian issue, urging the Security Council to pay attention to the fact that the Dutch government has not yet complied with the December 24th resolution to release Indonesian President Sukarno and other political prisoners and submit a report to the Security Council on accepting the resolution within 24 hours.</p>

<p>[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 28th] The Security Council reopened this morning to discuss the Palestinian issue, first reading a telegram from the Egyptian Foreign Minister denouncing the Israeli army's violation of the Nitzanim truce, followed by two reports from acting mediator Bunche, who also stated that Israel's attack on the Nitzanim area stated that "There was no provocation from the Egyptian side." Bunche also expressed regret that the Israeli army is currently restricting the activities of UN observers.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Paris, 28th] British Representative Bevin called on the Security Council on the 28th to order an immediate ceasefire in Palestine and to have the Jewish forces withdraw to their positions in the Nitzanim area in October. Bevin submitted a motion to the Security Council, limiting the Jewish and Egyptian armies to accept the Security Council's order by January 2. The proposal called for a meeting of the Security Council sub-committee to be convened on that day to determine whether both sides had complied with the order. Bevin said, "It is clear that Israel is responsible for violating the ceasefire order."</p>

<p>[United Press International, The Hague, 27th] The Dutch government announced today that Ambassador to the United States Kleffens has sent a letter to the Director of the U.S. Economic Cooperation Administration, Hoffman, requesting the restoration of the agency's aid to Indonesia. After the Dutch military offensive in Indonesia, the Economic Cooperation Administration announced that it would suspend aid pending clarification of the situation in Indonesia. [Associated Press, New York, 27th] Wallace demanded on the 27th that the United States stop sending arms and Marshall Plan aid to the Netherlands. Wallace condemned the UN's Indonesian ceasefire order as a "hypothetical and deliberately ineffective gesture." Wallace also accused the United States of being largely responsible for the Dutch attack on Indonesia. Wallace also declared: The Netherlands must be forced to withdraw from Indonesia and guarantee Indonesian independence.</p>
<h3 id="e53">Six Countries Complete Draft Agreement on Ruhr Industrial Control; Security Agency Established to Cooperate with the Ruhr Authority <a href="#e53" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c53" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">53</a></h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, London, 28th] According to the London Agreement of 1948, the conference of six countries authorized to establish the Ruhr International Authority today issued a final communiqué by representatives of the United Kingdom, the United States, France, the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg. The representatives of the six countries met in London and have now completed the draft agreement, which is ready to be submitted to their respective governments for approval. At the outset, the representatives agreed on how many institutions Germany should establish and how they should be created. The Ruhr Authority is only one of them and should be drafted from this perspective. To avoid duplication and overreach, each of these institutions should have its own specific task, and as a whole, it should have the following three objectives: (1) Guarantee German disarmament and demilitarization; (2) Promote European recovery, including democratic Germany; (3) Improve the close links of economic life in all countries. This is the only requirement to ensure peace and prosperity in Europe. Among the measures to prevent aggression, the establishment of the Security Agency is the most important measure. The task of this bureau was recently agreed upon in principle by the three military governments. The three military governments also decided to cooperate with the Ruhr Authority. The Security Agency will be fully responsible for disarmament and demilitarization. Regarding the issue of dismantling military industries, the bureau should act in accordance with the agreement on prohibiting and restricting German industry, which is about to be completed. The agreement stipulates that the maximum amount of crude steel production in the two occupied zones of Germany is 10.7 million tons. The most important goal of establishing the Ruhr Authority is to ensure that Ruhr resources will not be used for aggression in the future, but only for peaceful purposes and in line with the economic life of neighboring countries, including Germany. During the period when the occupying forces have great control over the German economy, the handling of all German affairs should be largely the responsibility of the occupying forces, but after the occupying forces withdraw, the German government will gradually be directly responsible. One of the main tasks of the new Ruhr Authority is to allocate Ruhr coal and steel for German consumption and to meet the production needs of the countries participating in the meeting in London.</p>

<p>Ashida Announced that He Will Participate in the Election While in Prison</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Tokyo, 28th] The Japanese general election for the House of Representatives will be held on the 23rd of next month, and the election campaign has already begun. U.S. military government teams began supervising election affairs throughout the country on the 28th. The supervision will also include investigating polling stations before, during, and after the general election, as well as during the counting of ballots. Prime Minister Shigeru Yoshida registered to run in his hometown of Kochi Prefecture, Shikoku.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Tokyo, 28th] Former Japanese Prime Minister Hitoshi Ashida's cabinet resigned due to repeated corruption cases during his term, and he himself is also suspected of being on trial. Ashida had originally announced his intention to retire from politics, but he reversed his previous statement on the 28th and decided to participate in the general election for the House of Representatives from behind bars. He did not want to be listed as a nominated candidate for his Liberal Party and applied to run in the Kyoto district.</p>

<p>[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 28th] At a press conference on the 27th, Yoshida made a statement on the situation in China, saying: It is currently difficult to predict the development of the situation in China. Generally speaking, it can be divided into two major areas controlled by the Nationalists and the Communists. These two areas will continue to confront each other for a considerable period of time. From Japan's point of view, there are some materials in the areas controlled by the Communists that Japan needs, and at the same time, Japan hopes to export a large number of materials to China.</p>
<h3 id="e56">Yugoslavia's Regulations and the West: Resuming Trade Relations to Break the Eastern European Economic Embargo <a href="#e56" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c56" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">56</a></h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Belgrade, 27th] Tito, in his speech to the joint session of Parliament today, condemned the Cominform countries for implementing an economic embargo against Yugoslavia in an attempt to hinder the country's industrialization, which he said violated the treaties they had signed with Yugoslavia. He added that these countries were trying to turn Yugoslavia into a purely agricultural country, so they could buy food from it. Yugoslavia is now trying to break the embargo by Eastern countries and trade with Western countries in order to purchase the machinery necessary to implement its economic plans. Since some People's Democratic countries have violated their agreements, we have had to sell our products to capitalist countries in order to purchase machinery. However, it must be stated that Yugoslavia's exchange of goods with Western countries is based on equality and without political conditions. Tito also denied that the majority of Yugoslavia's products are sold to Western countries. Tito then presented the 1949 budget proposal, which is 37 billion dinars (Yugoslav currency) more than the 1948 budget, and indicated that the military budget will be increased to develop the arms industry and improve housing for military officers. Following Tito's speech, Finance Minister Raiduza Lirivi-Kru announced that the total amount of the 1949 budget would reach 161 billion dinars. Tito finally listed the main tasks for 1949 as: (1) building industry, (2) modernizing mining, (3) developing the arms industry and building housing for military officers, (4) improving railway transportation, and (5) modernizing agriculture. Tito also said in his speech that Yugoslavia's trade with Western countries is only imitating what other Eastern countries are doing, such as the Soviet Union and Poland, so these countries have no reason to criticize Yugoslavia.</p>

<h3 id="e57">First Meeting of the Senate: Mayor Reports on Administration, Gendarmerie Brigade to Establish a Regiment First, Funds Allocated to Expedite the Construction of City Defense Works <a href="#e57" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c57" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">57</a></h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] The 8th meeting of the first session of the Municipal Senate was held at 3:30 p.m. yesterday. Speaker Pan, Vice Speaker Xu, and 152 senators were present. Mayor Wu, directors of various bureaus, and more than 30 others were in attendance. The meeting began with a report from the Senate Secretariat, and the agenda for the meeting was approved. The Speaker then appointed seven senators—Chen Boliang, Gao Shuan, Chen Peide, Ji Hao, Jiang Haoran, Fei Shusheng, and Chen Deying—to draw lots to determine the seating order of the senators. Then, Mayor Wu gave a report on the administration and answered questions from the senators. After a ten-minute break, Mayor Wu answered the questions one by one, and then the questions and answers from the Finance, Public Utilities, and Public Works Bureaus began. The meeting adjourned at 7 p.m. The second meeting will continue at 3 p.m. today to raise questions and answers from the Education, Police, Social Affairs, Land Administration, Civil Affairs, and Health Bureaus.</p>
<p>Yesterday, Mayor Wu gave a comprehensive report on the aspects of civil affairs, police affairs, social affairs, health, finance, education, public works, public utilities, and land administration as follows: (1) Civil Affairs: A. The general census of the city's population on November 8 was successful, which is very helpful for local self-defense work. B. The self-defense force has been established and is being carried out simultaneously in 30 districts. The participants have excellent morale. Basic military education is scheduled to be given within three months to ensure local security. (2) Police Affairs: A. The organization of the gendarmerie brigade has been delayed several times due to funding issues, but now there is progress. After consulting with Commander Chen of the Gendarmerie Command, it has been decided to immediately establish a regiment of about 1,900 people, which will be expanded later. B. City defense works. Since Commander Chen arrived in Shanghai, he has advocated that city defense works must be expedited. The authorities have now allocated 97 million yuan to begin construction. C. Air defense work. Air defense stations have been established, and a budget has been included for this year and will also be included for next year. D. Police treatment. Efforts are being made to improve it at any time. Recently, the city government is considering the issue of year-end bonuses. After consultation with various sectors, it was decided to raise self-defense funds through the following three methods: (1) Increasing the land price tax by 5 per mille, (2) Collecting product consolation donations, (3) Withdrawing 2/10 of the goods to be returned from the sealed materials.</p>
<h3 id="e58">Please Do Not Misunderstand the Highs and Lows of the Index; Relief and Consolation Efforts Are Being Actively Carried Out <a href="#e58" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c58" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">58</a></h3>
<p>(3) Social Affairs: A. After the price limits were lifted, there were many labor-management disputes. After the cost of living index was published, the labor side thought it was too low, while the management side found it unbearable. Moreover, there was much suspicion from all sides about the veracity of the cost of living index. In fact, the Cost of Living Index Review Committee is composed of representatives from all sectors, so it is impossible to fabricate it. It is hoped that all parties will not misunderstand. B. The issue of year-end bonuses is also very difficult. At present, various industries are declining. While the authorities sympathize with the lives of workers, the burden on the management side should also be taken into account. Efforts are being made to assist industrial loans to resolve the crisis. C. Relief and consolation work is currently underway. Eight porridge distribution centers have been opened. Nighttime corpse collection and mobile shelters are being organized. In addition, there are two issues related to the Social Affairs Bureau: (1) The work of consoling the soldiers at the front is being carried out enthusiastically under the leadership of Chairman Fang, and their spirit is admirable. (2) Rice and grain issue. Since the rice rush occurred, I have tried my best to ensure that the amount of rice in storage is sufficient. At present, the city has enough rice for one and a half months, and efforts are being made to increase it. There is absolutely no shortage of rice sources now. (4) Education: A. In accordance with the resolution of the previous Senate meeting, the number of classes is being gradually increased. Thirty-seven classes have been added to middle schools, and 161 classes have been added to national education. B. I regret the general leave of absence incident that occurred due to the poor treatment of teachers and staff. Strictly speaking, although the lives of teachers and staff are indeed difficult, are the lives of ordinary civil servants not difficult? After the general leave of absence incident occurred, I am very grateful for the assistance of the private primary and secondary school teachers' associations in resolving the issue.</p>
<h3 id="e59">Finances Are Extremely Difficult <a href="#e59" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c59" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">59</a></h3>
<p>(5) Finance: The city government's finances are extremely difficult. In October, it barely managed to get through with a subsidy of 8 million yuan from the central government. In November, it borrowed money from the National Bank to get by. The difficulties can be imagined. However, the city government is absolutely unwilling to increase the burden on citizens and will only urge the Finance Bureau to work hard to collect the existing tax items. (6) Public Works: A. The Wuzhen Road Bridge held a traffic opening ceremony this morning, which is clear proof that public officials are not corrupt. How so? The original budget for the bridge was 7.2 billion, but it was completed today by selling 100,000 cement sacks. If public officials were corrupt, the cement sacks would not need to be sold. B. The seawall project has made considerable progress to date. The U.S. originally allocated 300,000 U.S. dollars as funding, but it is now difficult to disburse the funds, which may be interrupted. Negotiations are underway. C. The Zhongshan South Road project. I am deeply grateful to the local citizens for voluntarily demolishing their houses to help the authorities complete the reconstruction.</p>
<h3 id="e60">Public Utilities Must Be Guaranteed <a href="#e60" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c60" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">60</a></h3>
<p>(7) Public Utilities: The Public Utilities Bureau is about to enter a period of being scolded again, because the prices of public utilities are about to be adjusted again. The price of foreign exchange coal has been increasing continuously for two months, which has had a significant impact on costs. The city government must take into account the burden on citizens, but it must also make efforts to maintain public utilities. Therefore, the authorities have decided to provide concrete guarantees for the future of public utilities. (8) Land Administration: Due to the tense situation, property owners are rushing to obtain their title deeds, which has made the work of the Land Administration Bureau particularly busy. Criticism from all sectors of the bureau is unanimously considered to be too slow. I personally went to the bureau to inspect and study the reasons for its slowness. I learned that the bureau has received 120,000 to 130,000 title deeds in the past two years, and 100,000 have been issued. There are still 20,000 that have not been completed, and 3,000 of them cannot be processed due to various incomplete procedures and documents. In order to eliminate corruption, I hope that senators will report any corruption they find, and the city government will thoroughly investigate and deal with it. (9) Health: A. The progress of the city's epidemic prevention work can be expressed in terms of the number of injections. This year, the Health Bureau has vaccinated 2.61 million people against cholera and 2.36 million people against smallpox. The fact that epidemics have not been prevalent this year is by no means without merit. B. The problem of garbage removal is serious. The city's population has doubled compared to before the war, while the number of garbage collectors has decreased by a quarter. Recently, due to the curfew, the Suzhou River is severely congested, hindering the navigation of garbage ships. The authorities are now trying to dredge it.</p>
<h3 id="e61">Senators Raise Questions <a href="#e61" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c61" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">61</a></h3>
<p>Senators raised questions: (1) Wang Liben: After the general leave of absence of primary and secondary school teachers, in addition to each person receiving one pound of wool yarn, the rest have not been cashed. Why not change the price and distribute the confiscated sealed materials? (2) Zhang Zhongyuan: The work of Pushan Villa is excellent, but it is now facing extreme financial difficulties. Please subsidize the city government. (3) Fei Shusheng: The rice distribution price for November is set too high, which is enough to affect price increases. Also, why have the prices of public utilities recently increased so much? Moreover, in this severe situation, should the mayor, as the mayor, firmly defend Shanghai, and should there be a clear expression of this? (4) Zhang Xuelian: The newly issued national identity cards have 144 purchase certificates attached, but they have not been cashed. Why? (5) Special elements are rushing to exchange gold, and scattered soldiers are forcibly selling towels. The authorities should stop them immediately. (6) Jiang Haoran: Where is the 100 billion yuan in legal tender previously fined for excessive electricity use, which was originally intended for the gendarmerie brigade? (7) Ding Shanming: A large number of troops have recently arrived in the suburbs. The authorities should find ways to increase their non-staple food expenses. (8) Huang Bingquan: The members of the Suppression and Construction Brigade should be prohibited from forcibly occupying civilian houses. (9) Zhang Zhihan: How should the materials of Yangzi Company be handled? (10) Yan Esheng: The authorities must ensure that the purchase and storage of grain and fuel are sufficient, and attention should also be paid to self-defense work. (11) Jiang Hao: Beggars are filling the bridgeheads and should be taken in immediately. (12) Tong Xiang: When people are rushing to exchange gold and silver, the police are arbitrarily beating people and should be stopped immediately. (13) Qu Yue: According to the central government's regulations, gold is not allowed to be freely bought and sold, so exchanging gold is equivalent to buying antiques. The method is obviously unreasonable, and local governments should have the right to amend it before implementing it. (14) Chu Shun: The city government should do its best to deal with the aftermath of the Jiangya Wheel disaster. (15) Zhu Shujian: There are too many refugees in the city, and they should be taken in as soon as possible.</p>
<h3 id="e62">Mayor Answers Questions: Rice Distribution Prices Cannot Be Too Low; Public Utilities Can Be Audited <a href="#e62" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c62" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">62</a></h3>
<p>Mayor Wu answered the questions as follows: (1) The supplies for primary and secondary school teachers, such as cigarettes and cooking oil, can be distributed immediately, but the procedures still need to be negotiated and decided by the Social Affairs Bureau and various associations. (2) Subsidies can be given to Pushan Villa within the possible range. (3) U.S. aid rice is not relief rice, and the price cannot be too low. The price increase of public utilities can be publicly audited. I am the chief local civil official. When the Communist Party released the blacklist yesterday, I was already on it. There seems to be no need to doubt whether I can stay in Shanghai. (4) The distribution certificates for the new national identity cards were formulated by the Economic Supervision Office, and the city government cannot be responsible for them. (5) Special elements rushing to exchange gold and scattered soldiers forcibly selling goods will be strictly investigated and banned by the Gendarmerie Department. (6) The fine of 100 billion legal tender has been used by the Public Utilities Bureau to purchase street lamp materials. (7) The non-staple food expenses for the troops stationed in the suburbs should be suggested to the Ministry of National Defense to issue in kind. (8) The members of the Suppression and Construction Brigade who forcibly occupy civilian houses will be stopped by the Gendarmerie Department. (9) The Yangzi case was originally under the supervision of the Economic Supervision Office. After the office was abolished, I immediately ordered the Social Affairs Bureau to handle it in accordance with the law. (10) The authorities are also paying close attention to the issue of storing grain and fuel and are trying to enrich it. (11) Beggars on the street can start to be taken in immediately. (12) Police beating gold exchangers will be guaranteed not to happen again in the future. (13) The gold exchange method was formulated by the central government, and local governments can only contribute reference opinions. (14) The city government will do its best to assist in the aftermath of the Jiangya Wheel disaster. (15) The work of providing relief to refugees is actively underway.</p>
<p>Finance</p>
<p>Bureau's Questions and Answers: Zhu Shujian said that the car license tax is too low. Why not increase it? Director Tian replied that the car license tax rate is set by the central government, and local governments have no right to modify it. However, he heard that the central government has also considered this recently and has formulated a new method. He has sent a letter to the central government to inquire about the contents of the new method.</p>
<p>Public Utilities</p>
<p>Bureau Questions and Answers: (1) Shi Qian said, why not restore the 16th Road trolleybus? (2) Chen Kai: Why not open the bus from Longhua Jingji Bridge to Xujiahui? (3) Zhu Shujian: What is the basis for the price adjustment of public utilities? (4) Zhu Hongyi: The public transportation company has been preparing for years, why is there no follow-up? (5) Yu Shun: Why is the allocation of gasoline for cars gradually decreasing? (6) Zhang Zhongyuan: Why has the number of cars on the road not decreased after the gasoline quota has decreased? Zhao Zengjue, Director of the Public Utilities Bureau, replied: (1) The road surface from Changchou Road to Caojiadu is badly damaged and is currently being repaired by the Public Works Bureau. The 16th Road will be opened after the repair is completed. (2) The Southeast Automobile Company is urged to expedite the opening of the bus from Longhua to Xujiahui. (3) The calculation of public utility prices is complicated and the Senate is welcome to audit the accounts publicly. (4) The valuation work of the public transportation company is not yet completed and it cannot be established yet. (5) The reduction in gasoline allocation for cars is due to the central government's austerity quota. (6) The number of cars has not decreased after the gasoline reduction, and it is possible that black market oil is being used.</p>
<p>Public Works</p>
<p>Bureau Questions and Answers: (1) Zhu Shujian: The Public Works Bureau repairs roads without a predetermined plan, which is a waste of manpower and materials. (2) Hou Junren: Why not dredge Bailonggang in the suburbs? Zhao Zukang, Director of the Public Works Bureau, replied: (1) There is indeed a plan for road repairs, but when the budget is compiled, it is insufficient to purchase materials when the funds are invested. (2) The Bailonggang project is organized by the City Relief Association's work relief office and is not under the jurisdiction of the Public Works Bureau. If you are eager to dredge, local gentry should be responsible.</p>
<h3 id="e63">The Labor Union Believes That the Housing Rent Standard Is Closely Related to the Cost of Living Index <a href="#e63" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c63" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">63</a></h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] The City Federation of Labor Unions held a meeting of the board of directors and supervisors yesterday to discuss a number of important cases. (1) Recently, various Baojia have been collecting settlement fees for volunteer soldiers without any standards, ranging from the value of several dou of rice to the value of several shi of rice, which workers cannot afford. It was decided that the principle is that each household with an adult male of conscription age will be charged the value of two dou of rice, and each household without an adult male of conscription age will be charged no more than the value of one dou of rice. The price of rice will be calculated at the distribution price. (2) When there was a rice shortage in the city, the City Social Affairs Bureau borrowed rice from various factories to distribute to workers. Now the bureau is urging the return of the rice. The labor union hopes to return the cash and decided to have Chairman Zhou Xuexiang go to the bureau to meet with Director Wu to discuss the matter, hoping to allow the return of cash, and the discounted price should not exceed the distribution price. (3) In the current formula for compiling the cost of living index, the item of housing rent is still calculated according to the old standard before the currency reform. In fact, after the currency reform, during the price limit period and after the price limit was lifted, housing rents have been adjusted several times. Housing rent accounts for a large percentage of the index. If it is not corrected quickly, it will have a significant impact on the index. It was decided to ask the labor representatives in the Senate to raise the issue and ask for the standard to be revised to avoid workers suffering invisibly.</p>
<h3 id="e64">Next Cost of Living Index <a href="#e64" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c64" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">64</a></h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] Today is the last price survey for the next cost of living index for this month. The price is surveyed twice a week, usually on Tuesdays and Fridays, but the last Friday of this month happens to be the 31st, which is also New Year's Eve. It was decided to change the survey to Mondays and Wednesdays. The price of this month just started to rise in a straight line on the 23rd (Thursday), and the rising trend was even stronger on Friday the next day. Therefore, the change in the survey date has a great impact on the index. The Tai period index will be the standard for general factories to issue year-end awards, which is of great importance. It is expected that disputes may arise in the Cost of Living Index Compilation Review Committee because of this, which will not be as smooth as the previous few times.</p>

The distribution price varies depending on the type of oil: soybean oil and raw oil are 17 yuan per catty, raw vegetable oil is 16 yuan per catty, sesame oil is 15 yuan per catty, and cooked vegetable oil is 13 yuan per catty. The 54 members of the Oil Business Association will handle the sales on behalf of the association.</p>

<p>[Report from this newspaper] Eight units, including the Post Office, the Telecommunications Bureau, the Materials Storage and Transportation Department of the Ministry of Transportation, the Transportation Management Committee, the Textile Construction Company, the International No-Stack Radio Station, and the Welfare Associations of the two roads, because they were not allowed to participate in the collective deposit and exchange of gold and silver for public and private employees, had previously sent representatives to petition the National Bank and the City Government separately, requesting the same treatment as public and private employees, but had never succeeded. Yesterday at 11 a.m., the representatives went to the National Bank again to petition. Liu Gongyun received them and the representatives again requested to deposit and exchange gold and silver according to the methods for public and private employees. Liu replied that the improved methods for deposit and exchange are still being studied by the Ministry of Finance, and they will be deposited and exchanged according to the new methods after they are announced. The representatives insisted on handling it in the same way as the city government agencies. The debate continued until noon without a conclusion, and they left disappointed.</p>

<h3 id="e71">Tsinghua Alumni Gather for Dinner to Celebrate Birthday: President Mei Talks About the Recent Situation of Tsinghua Garden <a href="#e71" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c71" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">71</a></h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] Today is the sixtieth birthday of Mei Yiqi, President of Tsinghua University. The alumni of the university in Shanghai took advantage of President Mei's visit to Shanghai to hold a dinner party at the Tsinghua Alumni Association on Jiujiang Road at 6 p.m. yesterday to celebrate President Mei's birthday. More than 160 alumni including Li Zhaoshi, Sun Ruihuang, Shen Zonglian, Xia Jianbai, Xiang Zhezhen, and Li Jianwu attended. President Mei and his younger brother Mei Yidou attended the meeting. All the alumni sang [Birthday Song] and presented President Mei with a signed commemorative album from the alumni in Shanghai to show their respect. The alumni expressed great concern about the government's announcement that Mei would be the Minister of Education and the situation of the alma mater in the war. President Mei gave a detailed report during the meeting. He said that his trip south was to find ways to help the faculty and students of the northern universities, not to become an official, and he also admitted that he did not have enough talent and experience. Therefore, he firmly declined the government's announcement of his appointment as the Minister of Education and asked the government to select another capable person as soon as possible to avoid the long-term suspension of ministerial affairs. He himself did not intend to come south, because the Handan Broadcasting Station had once reported that after the "liberation," he would still remain as the president of the university. In order to avoid misunderstandings from the outside world, he flew south on the 21st.</p>
<p>Regarding the situation of Tsinghua Garden, President Mei said: On the 12th of this month, he still believed that the situation would not change drastically. Unexpectedly, on the 13th, he suddenly heard gunfire, and at the same time, a cook was injured by stray bullets. He himself went into the city on the 14th to inquire about the news. Since then, he has not been able to return to the school because he could not pass through the city gate. By the 16th, telephone contact was also cut off. Later, three foreign professors entered the city and claimed that the location of the school had become a "liberated area," but the communist army did not enter the school. The situation in the school was quite stable. To this day, only more than 20 professors and more than 100 students have entered the city, and they are all paid by Peking University's loans and allowed to live on campus and borrow books. There are still more than 2,000 students and 700 to 800 faculty, staff, and family members left in Tsinghua Garden. Regarding materials, the school has nearly 4,000 bags of flour, plus private reserves, which can last for at least a month. According to the foreign professors who entered the city, it is now possible to resume classes. As for the rumor that more than a dozen Tsinghua students were injured by stray bullets while entering the city, it cannot be confirmed and is probably a rumor. At present, the heads of various universities in Beijing, with the assistance of the Ministry of Education, have established a joint office in Beijing for the national universities in Beiping and Tianjin. If the weather turns better, planes will be sent to transport the faculty, staff, and students of various universities to the south for settlement. It is reported that President Mei is scheduled to return to Beijing within today and tomorrow.</p>

<p>[Report from this newspaper] The case of Deng Zhonghe, a giant businessman in the city, being accused of being a traitor by Zhu Zhengwen, was previously approved by the City High Procuratorate to be transferred to the Hangzhou Zhejiang High Procuratorate for further investigation. Zhu Zhengwen, the accuser in the case, claimed at the beginning of the accusation that Deng had held a press conference and published an announcement in various newspapers, accusing him of being an "extortionist bandit" and extortion. Zhu believed that it was Deng's insult, so he filed a private prosecution against Deng in the City District Court for defamation, and the District Court once opened the trial. Because Deng's traitor case was being investigated in Hangzhou, this case was also put on hold and no longer opened. Recently, the Hangzhou High Procuratorate has issued a decision of non-prosecution because the evidence in the case of Zhu accusing Deng of suspicion of being a traitor is insufficient. The Tai City District Court will schedule a second trial in the case of Zhu accusing Deng of defamation in the coming days.</p>

<p>Although the O' team lost, their fierce defense and fast throws showed no signs of sluggishness. Hu Xiaozi, with a height of six feet, held the position of center and was known for "flying around the court." In terms of stamina, the O' team seemed like bulls, but the court was not heated enough, which was a disadvantage. Throughout the game, the most outstanding players on the O' team were Que, Nieger, and Macdonald. In the first half for Ren Yu, Wu Xinyun was better, while in the second half, Li Zhaohe contributed significantly. The scores of the two teams are recorded as follows:</p>

<p>The initial purpose of the Yun Chu Assets Management Committee's Charity Fund is limited to promoting chemical engineering education. The committee believes that the chemistry curriculum in middle schools is the foundation for future chemical engineering education, and currently, chemistry teachers in various schools adhere to their positions in this difficult environment and devote themselves to teaching and serving the nation. Their spirit is truly admirable. Therefore, it has been decided to donate this charity fund to all chemistry teachers in public and private senior and junior middle schools in the city as a "carbon gift" to express appreciation and comfort. Currently, according to the list of chemistry teachers submitted in the survey form of the Shanghai Municipal Education Bureau, there are a total of 323 people in the city. Each person who teaches chemistry for more than six hours per week will be given 400 yuan in gold, and those who teach less than six hours will receive a proportional gift (but this only applies to a very small number of 14 people), totaling approximately 130,000 yuan in gold. After discussions between Director Li of the Municipal Education Bureau and the committee, it was decided that the committee would directly deliver the gifts to each person according to the list.</p>
<h3 id="e77">Verdict in Student Communist Spy Case: Duan Ze Sentenced to Six Months, Remaining Four Acquitted <a href="#e77" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c77" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">77</a></h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] The case of students Duan Ze (Tongji), Yang Guichang (Fudan), Ye Jinrong (Jinan), Yin Minzhi (Shanghai Law), and Song Henian (Hua Shi Middle School), who were accused of being Communist spies, was judged yesterday by the Special Criminal Court. Duan Ze was sentenced to six months of imprisonment for participating in an organization aimed at subverting the government. Yang Guichang was found not guilty of endangering the country, and the forgery of documents was not accepted and transferred to the District Court for handling (temporarily allowed bail). Ye Jinrong, Song Henian, and Yin Minzhi were all found not guilty (released in court). The reasoning behind the verdict: Duan Ze was a student at Tongji University and had participated in the Communist Party, lurking within the school and contacting the traitor Li Qun. In August of this year, the party and government organs discovered and arrested him. After investigation, the diary of Li Qun contained records of the defendant's activities, which could be used to determine that he had committed the crime of endangering the country and should be punished. The accusation that Yang Guichang and the other four had subverted the government lacked concrete evidence and could not be accepted, so they could not be wrongly convicted.</p>

<h3 id="e93">Authorities Meticulously Plan Countermeasures to Channel Speculative Funds and Stabilize Commodity Prices <a href="#e93" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c93" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">93</a></h3>
<p>Recently, the rise in commodity prices in the city has continued unabated. Commodity prices change drastically every day, causing public panic and endless worries. Generally, this phenomenon is attributed to the government's announcement of the suspension of gold and silver exchange. However, according to financial management officials, the main reason for this price increase is still the rampant speculative mentality of speculative funds, coupled with the deliberate agitation of some speculators. They pointed out that recently, speculative funds from the north have been of a considerable amount; in addition, at the beginning of the Xuzhou-Bengbu Campaign, some of the funds fleeing from the city to the south have also flowed back to Shanghai recently, causing this sluggish commodity market to experience a price increase beyond the ordinary. They said that the authorities are already formulating a meticulous countermeasure to address this issue. The focus of this new countermeasure will be on guiding speculative funds and tightening credit. They also pointed out that at this time of sluggish transactions, once the overnight interest rate rises, it will force speculators and hoarders to retreat.</p>
<p>[Another dispatch] According to financial management officials, the bureau is currently consulting with the Central Bank on effective ways to guide speculative funds in order to stabilize the market and suppress the rise in commodity prices. At the same time, they have also begun to crack down on the black market for gold notes and the high-priced trading of silver dollars, in conjunction with the Municipal Police Department and other relevant agencies.</p>
<p>Speculative funds from Beijing and Tianjin are fleeing to Shanghai in large quantities, which is extremely turbulent. According to official statistics, the amount of money remitted from the north in the past month has reached nearly 100 million yuan per day, resulting in extremely loose credit in the city. Speculative funds are causing trouble everywhere, and commodity prices are greatly affected. The authorities attach great importance to this and are quickly seeking a solution. Liu Gongyun of the Central Bank told reporters yesterday that short-term treasury bills will be issued in large quantities, and ways will be found to solve the problem of listing. As for the company bond issue previously mentioned, the Central Bank is now considering issuing it.</p>
<h3 id="e94">Influenced by Price Increases in Other Sectors, Rice Prices Rise Sharply; Flour and Miscellaneous Grains are Firm; Oil Prices Soar <a href="#e94" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c94" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">94</a></h3>
<p>Rice prices rose sharply because the previous day's decline was too great, and prices were close to production prices. Other commodity prices also rose sharply, making people quite bullish. In the southern market, the opening price was 70 to 80 yuan higher. White japonica rice was priced at 535 yuan, and thin indica rice was priced at 540 yuan. After the market closed, it was heard that prices in other sectors had risen, so prices were raised again by 20 yuan. In the northern market, white japonica rice was priced at 550 yuan, and early thin indica rice rose sharply by 90 yuan. Yesterday's arrivals were slightly reduced, with a total of 10,786 stones in the northern and southern markets.</p>
<p>Flour</p>
<p>With rice prices rising and all other commodities rising sharply, the upward trend continued unabated. The opening price for old car flour was as high as 246 yuan, and then, with the absorption of retail investors, it rose further to close at 263 yuan, up 48 yuan. Bingchuan flour was priced at 259 yuan, and Hongfeng and Jiancheng flour each rose by 50 yuan. Wheat bran continued to rise sharply, with large packages rising by 30 yuan.</p>
<p>Miscellaneous Grains</p>
<p>The upward trend became more severe. Due to rising rice prices, people were already bullish, and the sharp rise in prices in other sectors made the market even tighter, with more purchases than sales. Soybeans rose by 60 to 80 yuan. Corn and red sorghum were easily sold and rose sharply, with the former rising by 100 yuan and the latter rising by 80 yuan, a 40% increase. Mung beans and wheat rose sharply, sesame seeds rose by 100 yuan, and raw peanuts rose sharply by 50%. Yangzheng raw peanuts were priced at 1,250 yuan.</p>
<p>Cooking Oil</p>
<p>Prices rose crazily. Speculative funds poured in, and buying became rampant. After the market opened, prices soared. Soybean oil initially opened at 1,950 yuan and rose to 2,350 yuan at the close, a sharp increase of 670 yuan. Rapeseed oil also broke through the 2,000 yuan mark and closed at 2,250 yuan, with each rising by about 40%. Jitone rapeseed oil rose by 700 yuan, reaching 2,400 yuan. Soybean cake rose slightly after the initial increase, with a total increase of 40 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e95">Tea Market is Prosperous <a href="#e95" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c95" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">95</a></h3>
<p>According to tea industry insiders, the year-end of the lunar calendar is approaching, and the industry's credit feels tighter. However, due to the depletion of tea stocks, the cost of reproduction is increasing day by day. With the sudden rise in financial commodities, sellers are holding on even more fiercely, and the asking price is changing frequently. The market is becoming more prosperous, and prices are shining brightly. Domestic tea is being sought after in this street and other places, and transactions are continuing. As for export container tea, the shipping schedule is still far away, so buying is limited, and not much business is being done.</p>
<h3 id="e96">Tung Oil Soars <a href="#e96" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c96" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">96</a></h3>
<p>The tung oil market opened in the morning due to the exuberance of the people, and the trend was upward. Later, it was further stimulated by the soaring prices of various commodities. In addition, sufficient tung oil was being used for restocking by foreign firms, and the buying interest of paint shops on this street for refined tung oil was also strong. Sellers raised prices one after another, and the market moved rapidly all the way. As a result of the market closing, prices rose by 400 to 500 yuan compared to the previous market.</p>
<h3 id="e97">Silk and Satin Soar <a href="#e97" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c97" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">97</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the silk market rose again. People in the industry are already crazy. All commodities in other sectors are rising together, and everyone is buying. Retail investors all have a bullish mentality, so the market price is rising without end.</p>
<p>The opening price of No. 120 Tianqiao was 32,000 yuan. The Taiban gang quickly raised prices, and the silk weaving industry tried its best to absorb the supply. Inventories quickly became scarce, and demand was still strong. The asking price rose step by step, and the high price once reached 34,500 yuan. Later, due to the excessive rise in prices in recent days, bulls were afraid of a backlash, so the intention to sell became stronger, and the buying interest in the market also flattened. The market returned to a small 500 yuan, a strong increase of 5,000 yuan. Dongyang Jin and Sanma each rose by about 5,000 yuan.</p>
<p>The spot price of raw silk rose sharply due to the increase in foreign exchange transfer certificates. People's minds are filled with the idea of catching the peak. However, because the market price is too high, the industry is quite wary, and foreign firms are also buying less. The market price softened after rising, but the closing price still showed an increase. D-grade 78 uniformity white factory silk was priced at 33,500 yuan. The buying interest in the middle was not strong, and the asking price showed a slight decrease. Retail investors' thoughts were particularly soft, and there were frequent sales in the market. Later, cotton yarn rose sharply, and foreign exchange rose again. People's minds became agitated again, and the asking price tended to rise again. Near noon, the high price was 36,500 yuan at the close, up 7,000 yuan. In the afternoon, people continued to be bullish, and the asking price was 300 to 500 yuan higher, but transactions were scarce.</p>
<p>Due to raw silk weaving, the market conditions for silk satin cannot be stabilized. Speculators outside the industry have also begun to hoard and buy, and everyone is bullish. Meiya was opened in the morning at 19,500 yuan. It was heard that commodity prices in other sectors had jumped sharply, and people were greatly stimulated. The market was filled with excited buying, and the asking price went straight up, reaching a high of 21,500 yuan. After the high, the market turned flat because of weak actual sales and unstable foundations. As a result, the closing price was 21,000 yuan, up another 4,000 yuan. Huaqiang closed at 20,500 yuan, up only 3,000 yuan. The common rest rose by 30% to 50%.</p>
<h3 id="e98">Strong Buying Interest and Firm Holding by Dealers Lead to New Highs in Cotton Yarn Prices; Lively and Comprehensive Surge in the Fabric Market <a href="#e98" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c98" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">98</a></h3>
<p>The upward trend in cotton yarn shows no sign of stopping. Spot transactions are active, and dealers are reluctant to sell. Prices of all yarns are rising across the board.</p>
<p>42-count Blue Phoenix opened at 34,000 yuan, briefly fell to 33,500 yuan, then surged to close at a high of 39,000 yuan, a sharp increase of 7,000 yuan. 40-count Blue Phoenix last traded at 35,300 yuan, a dramatic rise of 7,300 yuan. 32-count Silver Moon initially opened at 28,000 yuan and eventually reached the 30,000 yuan mark, jumping by 4,300 yuan.</p>

Other yarns, such as 10-count yarn, also hit unprecedented new highs.</p>
<p>The fabric market also repeatedly saw new highs, and the rising trend continued to be strong. Local buyers were very active, and sellers firmly held onto their goods. Prices of all fabrics surged across the board.</p>
<p>Grade 1 Fine Cloth initially opened at 840 yuan. It briefly dropped to 830 yuan, but then buying interest suddenly intensified, and the price rose to 870 yuan. The afternoon close was 865 yuan, resulting in a significant increase of 120 yuan.</p>
<p>Mid-range Fine Cloth also saw lively trading, with market prices consistently above 800 yuan. "Four Gentlemen" Plain Serge closed at 840 yuan, a sharp increase of 130 yuan. "Golden Lotus Dancing" Plain Serge and "Leifeng Pagoda" Plain Serge also aggressively advanced to new highs. "Four Gentlemen" Plain Drill surged by 125 yuan. Other fabrics such as Shilin Cloth and printed fabrics all jumped by 10% to 20%. In the afternoon, off-market bidding continued to escalate.

<h3 id="e99">Deadline Approaching for Increased Capital of Trading Firms; National Banks Handling Capital Verification Procedures <a href="#e99" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c99" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">99</a></h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] The deadline for transferring the increased capital portions of commercial trading firms in this city is rapidly approaching. In order to understand the actual use of the increased capital funds, the Central Bank recently sent personnel to various trading firms to handle capital verification procedures, which are expected to be completed within a day or two. At that time, the transfer deadline will also arrive, and the various trading firms can formally apply for the transfer. Furthermore, according to sources from the Bankers Association: The Silver Money and Trust Industries Association is notifying members to expedite the capital increase procedures, hoping to submit them to the Central Bank within the deadline. The cash transfer portion, however, is still under consideration due to usage issues. The Ministry of Finance has not yet clearly indicated its stance, so the trading firms are not yet prepared to transfer it. It is reported that the Chamber of Commerce has sent a letter stating that the Ministry of Finance will not freeze the cash, and the Silver Money and Trust Industries Association has also sent a letter requesting the Ministry of Finance to change the usage methods, but the Ministry of Finance has not yet responded. The association believes that the current financial strength of the silver money industry is weak. If the funds are frozen according to the Ministry of Finance's regulations, capital will not be able to circulate. Therefore, the issue of cash usage is of great concern to the relevant trading firms, and they will vigorously fight for their interests. Thus, before the usage methods are agreed upon, the capital increase procedures can be completed within the deadline, but the transfer of the cash portion will be considered later.</p>

<h3 id="e102">28th Application Begins "Reader Relief Fund" Calls for Donations <a href="#e102" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c102" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">102</a></h3>
<p>The "Reader Relief Fund" sponsored by this newspaper, has approved the seventh group of eight people and disbursed the funds. The 28th application period begins now and will end on December 31st. Those found to be genuinely in need will receive appropriate assistance. This relief fund is specifically for fellow citizens suffering from orphaning, widowhood, poverty, illness, old age, weakness, disability and hardship. The application procedure requires submitting one application form detailing the circumstances of distress, certified by the local Bao or Jia leader, and securing a shop guarantee. Mail the application with its batch number to the Social Service Department of this newspaper for review. In recent months, due to rising prices, the need for relief funds has also increased sharply, causing the original fund to be rapidly depleted. It is hoped that enthusiastic readers from all walks of life will generously donate to enable these suffering fellow citizens to receive timely assistance, rekindling their courage to survive, which would be greatly appreciated.</p>

<p>[Answer to Mr. Xu Hao of Jiangdu] The Civil Code stipulates: "Marriage contracts should be entered into by the man and woman themselves." Also, "Men under the age of seventeen and women under the age of fifteen may not enter into marriage contracts." When your younger sister was four years old, your mother made the decision to arrange a marriage for her with Mr. Wang. This marriage contract is fundamentally invalid under the law. Now that she is an adult, she can declare it dissolved. After the dissolution procedures are completed, she can then enter into a marriage contract with another man. Mr. Wang has no right to interfere.</p>
<p>[Answer to Mr. Yu Gongfu of Shanghai] Hosting banquets for weddings and other celebrations in non-public venues does not require paying banquet tax. However, if hosted in public venues, even if temporary workers are hired to handle the arrangements or materials are purchased and prepared independently, the taxpayer must first conduct an evaluation by the local tax authorities to estimate the tax amount and report and pay taxes in advance.</p>
