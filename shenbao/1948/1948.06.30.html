<h3>立院會期再度展延　預算案將秘密審查　平抑物價政院擬新方案</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿九日電〕第一屆立法院第一會期，業經該院廿九日院會決定再度展延至七月廿日止，自廿一日開始休會，在此期間，該院將集中全力，處理卅七年下半年度國家總預算案及其他急待獲致決議之重要法案。</p>
<p>〔本報南京廿九日電〕立院將於七月二日例會期舉行秘密會議，分次討論卅七年下半所度國家總預算案，屆時行政院長，主計長及財政部長均將依預算法第卅三條之規定，列席說明。國家總預算案原應廿八日送達立院，然以印校費時，未克如期發出，主計長徐堪廿八日午後曾訪立院秘書長張肇元，面吿原因，並謂將儘快於廿九日提出，乃廿九日午後立院會議進行時，張秘書長復得政院秘書長李惟果及徐氏電話，謂總預算案印校費時，恐非至七月二日晨不及提送立院，會中當決議將原訂一日舉行之秘密臨時會議取消，改二日例會秘密舉行討論該案。同時並通過尹述賢等臨時動議，對總預算案之審查，應絕對機密，不能於決議前將有關消息見諸報端，以昭鄭重。</p>
<p>〔本報南京廿九日電〕立院廿九日上午會中，馬乘風等臨時動議，請政院翁院長於午後會中列席報吿對平抑物價有無辦法案，引起熟烈討論，吳鐵城·張之江·于錫來·張金鑑·王德箴等均發言，强調當前法幣慘跌，物價狂漲，局勢之嚴重，然多不主張再從事徒勞無益之報吿與檢討。最後決議與翁院長，王財長及央行俞總裁，就法幣發行與管制物價交換意見。</p>
<h3>翁院長晉謁總統　面呈新擬平抑物價辦法　內容側重管制金融市場</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿九日電〕連日物價掀起劇烈漲風，幾使經濟陷入混亂之境，各方均至注意。立·監兩院亦先後提出斜舉及討論，促使政院迅採緊急措施，有效平抑物價。據悉：翁院長於物價狂漲中，已與有關部目長王雲五等擬具一平抑物價方案，並晋謁總統面呈該案，俟總統核准後即可付諸實施。此項方案之擬定，翁院長曾廣徵各專家之意見，並針對目前物價上漲之特殊原因，而提出對症下藥之辦法，聞辦法之重心仍側重於金融市塲之管制，對於檢查倉庫，嚴禁囤積居奇等，亦訂有詳細辦法。</p>
<h3>有關反美扶日動議　立院通過暫保留　全面改革經濟案交四委會審查　程序委會組織規程通過</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿九日電〕立法院第一會期第十六次會議，廿九日舉行，孫院長主席，晨九時半開會後，首進行報吿事項，通過上次會議紀錄，並對行政院咨請審議修正海關進口稅則案，前國民政府發交前立院移送審議關稅貿易協定及其暫行實施議定青之接受及簽署案，行政院咨請審議鹽稅稅率條例草案案等三件密案，其他政府咨提法案，決議分別交各關係委會審查。繼由報吿員宣讀該院財金委會報吿臨時財產稅案成立小組初步審查進行情形，與不克如限於六月底前提出院會報吿之理由。另有北平師院復大委會請願函，國民黨中央靑年部爲金大自治會請願事復函，國防部關於派遺大軍援汴事復函等文件。然後進行討論事項：（一）該院國防委會函復審查總統咨以天水及西峯鎭等地宣吿臨時戒嚴，請追認案，決議依審查意見通過，應予追認。（二）吳雲鵬等提議爲收容蒙古流亡人士，協助蒙古政務推動，在蒙藏委會中暫設蒙古輔導團案，決議交邊政委會審查，旋於休息後，由該院秘密會議洩露責任調查委會召集人江一平報吿該委會廿八日開會情形及決定調查程序及辦法，經會衆同意，逾午散會。</p>
<p>下午三時半續會，首由簡貫三報吿晨間與黃元彬，劉振東，崔敬伯，黃宇人等被推接見京·滬工商業反對開徵財產稅請願代表之經過，彼等所提請願書，決交財金委會研究參考。旋由孫院長徵得會衆同意，改變議程，提前討論法制委會報吿審查監院咨送監察法草案案，毛翼虎等爲擬定監察法草案，請公決案（決議見另電）及法制委會報告草擬立院程序委會組織規程草案案，後者決議通過，程序委會並定由法制委會代表召集，於卅日成立，開始從事加强議事工作效能。此三案處理完畢後，仍進行原議程所列各討論事項，丘漢平等提議爲實施全面極濟改革，擬咨請政府立即遵照憲法有關國民經濟各條規定，重訂經濟財政金融政策，修正現行稅法案，決議交財金。經資·地政·僑務四委會會同審查。外委會函復審查李雲良等臨時動議，請政府迅採緊急措施，防止一切助長日本軍事及經濟力量之行動，並警覺美國德萊勃計劃可能造成之嚴重危機案，經外委會召集人劉文島說明該委會決議之理由後，通過審查意見，「暫丁保留」。宋述樵等提議，各機關組織法規應限期完成立法程序，凡非依法設置之機關，不得列入預算由國庫開支案，決議原則通過，交預算委會注意。段劍岷及邵鏡人等所提有關軍事與糧草採購兩提案，決議併交國防委會研審參考。</p>
<p>王俊提議促請政府迅將海南島改省案，決議交國防委會會同內政及地方自治委會審查。孫翔鳳·劉雲昭及曲直生等有關糧政之三案，決議併交糧政委會審查，下午六時一刻散會。</p>
<p>〔本報南京廿九日電〕監察法草案，經廿五日立院會議，交法制委會審查後，該委會以依據憲法規定，監院無直接向立院爲提案之明文，決議對該草案未便審查，改由立委毛冀虎等連署，代爲提出，于廿九日立院會議中報吿通過，除咨復監院退回其所提法案外，監察法草案仍交法制委會限期審查完竣，提出報告。</p>

<h3>陳立夫訪問賴伊　參觀聯合國總部</h3>
<p>〔中央社成功湖廿八日電〕陳立夫氏於首次來聯合國總部觀光時，時訪聯合國秘書長賴伊。旋由我出席經社理事會代表張彭春引導蠢觀理事會會議廳，及各小組會會議室。陳氏於返紐約前，並與秘書處人員及我駐聯合國代表團官員，於代表餐室內進午餐</p>
<h3>對保留反美扶日案　劉文島說明理由　美並未提出德萊勃計劃</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿九日電〕立院廿九日院會中，無異議接受外委會審查意見，決議將李雲良氏前次所提有關「反美扶日」之臨時動議「暫予保留」。據外委會召集人劉文島說明審查理由，對李氏原案關於警覺美國德萊勃計劃可能造成嚴員危機一點，認爲（一）一九四五年九月，十一個遠束委會通過之飽萊計劃，其法律之基礎從未動搖。（二）斯揣克計劃與德萊勃計劃仍僅止計劃而已，美國並未表示將採爲國策提出遠東委會。（三）我在遠東委會保有否決權，任何不利於我國之意見，我均可堅持反對而否決之。立院固可以決議督責並支持政府，然目前絕不需無目的之緊急措施。至對防止日本軍事力量，經濟力量再起一節，則認爲（一）對日通商乃片面的，並未允日船載貨來我國港口。（二）我國從未劃定保護漁區，日漁船在我領海以外捕魚，被擊沉或逮捕者，猶待處理，總之，我決不容其侵我漁權。（三）日本賠償額中我分得最多，不好過事苛索。（四）美國扶日有何事實，尙待充分研究後，方可確定，是以外委會對李案決議暫予保留。劉氏並謂：雖然李氏此案已引起國內外注意，認美國扶日而加反對，但在興論容可發抒意見，學生容可採取行動，然立院對此不能不愼重判斷，再作決定。</p>
<h3>監院通過指派委員　調查物價真相　並再請行政院採取有效措施</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿九日電〕監院廿九日晨九時半舉行第十三次會議，于右任主席，秘書處宣讀第十二次會議紀錄後，首由王冠吾報吿審查政院就平抑物價糾正案之覆函（巳誌廿九日本報）之結果，旋即由各委員分別發表意見，有主張立即派員出發調查眞相，有主張即組財政經濟委員會澈底研究此事，旋復有毛以亨主張，在審查意見內調查之對象爲平。津·滬三地應增穗市，因穗爲華南大本營，同時更應調查國家銀行，生產貸款亦予反對，因一般說來，均係「生產貸款其各，豪門貸款其實」。陳志明稱，執行政策者即係操縱政策者。綜合各委負發言，對審查意見並無大出入，最後有陳大榕提出建議稱，（一）應再請政院採有效措施，（二）本院續作切實調查眞相後提大會審查。關於調查人員，不必由委員推選，由院長指派即可，且須保守秘密，當經表決，以陳大榕之意見獲致通過。繼由田烱錦報告廿八日列席立法院審查委員會之經過、報吿監院送立院之監察法於立院審查會中業已提出，但以監院提送立院法律案於法無據，故審查無法進行，旋採折衷辦法，由立委署名提出於立院。末仍提出監委行署組織條例草案討論，關於行署之委員任期，籍貫，委員人數等，討論甚久，意見紛紜，最後有人認爲，該項草案討論數日未獲結果，應即提付表決，經主席概括數點意見分別表決，最後決定者爲行署委員爲三人，委員之籍貫是否迴避，不作硬性規定。其任期爲一年，不得連任，會議即於十二時半散。</p>
<h3>行署組織條例　監院修正通過</h3>
<p>財政困難行署難同時成立</p>
<p>〔本報南京二十九日電〕監察院廿九日下午三時，續開第十三次會，討論監委行署組織案例草案，于右任主席，就上午討論之原草案等四條起繼續討論。各委員提出修正意見者甚多，經提付表決，均未獲通過。休息後李煦寰提議第四條删除，而另以辦事細則規定之，經表決在塲九十一人以五十一人贊成通過。第五條楊上棟提議，增加第二項「行署委員會議主席由委員輪流担任之」又獲通過。第六條以下無甚修正，僅趙光宸提議十一，十二，十三條均併於第十條之內，第十四條移作第十條之第二項，獲得通過。第十五，十六兩條略有文字修正，全草案至此乃全部修正通過。</p>
<p>〔中央社南京廿九日電〕監院于院長右任廿九日下午五時半在監院第十三次會議中懇切說明，目前國家財政困難，監院各委會及各監委行署所應配置之職員，一時殊難如數任用，各行署恐亦不能同時成立，而須視事實需要選擇若干地區先行成立。</p>

<p>〔央社華盛頓廿八日電〕我政府人員廿八日否認中國於中美雙邊協定中，可能予日本最惠國待遇之說。並謂：我政府及美方談判代表，已協議將日本剔除，其他三地區「南韓·西德及的港」，則仍在討論。</p>

<h3>社論　學府裏免於恐懼的自由</h3>
<p>—為成學教授與學生諸君再進一言—</p>
<p>一九四一年八月，美國故總統羅斯福與英國前首相邱吉爾發表聯合宣言，首先提到要爲全世界人類爭取享有「免於匱乏和免於恐懼的生活自由」。次年一月的聯合國宣言，也接受此一原則。而羅斯福以後播講，對於戰後世界的理想，賡續强調「言論·信仰·與免於匱乏，免於恐怖的自由」。言論信仰自由是民主理想的老傳統，「免於匱乏」則在工業革命資本主義高潮後更見其軍要，而「免於恐懼」可說是現代極權主義與新侵略主義滋長中人們日漸感到迫切需要的精神自由。</p>
<p>在今日世界中的今日中國，我們特別恐懼破壞和平的第三次大戰會否早臨，我們且已受到共匪叛亂中的軍事威脅和恐懼，而在研究高深學術的大學院校的門牆裏，篤實的教授和好學的學生，特別受到特種可怕的精神威脅：他們比生活困難更感到深刻痛苦的是精神上失去了「免於恐懼的自由」！他們在部分學生演導「壁報」，「開會」，「競選」，「罷課」，「遊行」的一速串活動和緊張空氣中，失去了講學的自由與求學的自由；在不敢正面表示意見的窒息中，還得沉浸於「上不成課」的顧慮，和或因異議而積被惡名或災禍的恐怖之中！</p>
<p>羅斯福的墓草已夙，而遺言在耳。我們抗戰軍民的鮮血已乾，而正義不泯。崇尙眞理的大學師生，回味七年前所導揚的那自由的吼聲，溯憶十年前我們學府安定進步的昔景，應不勝其人事滄桑之感，與文教萎縮之懼罷！</p>
<p>我們對於半年來起伏不息的學潮，不常置論，偶有論述，也惟評責罷課行爲之目誤誤國，呼籲教授之不容坐視，期望學校師生之能運用理智，表達多數意見，以挽回社會的同情。茲更願根據一月來若干大學的事態，來指出多數大學師生如何困灌於徬徨與恐懼之中，以供我忠於作青的教授和好學學生的商確和檢省。</p>
<p>在國際兩大壁壘對峙，冷戰態演愈烈之中，全世界人類無不同受戰爭的威脅。但人們雖無法安享究全免於戰爭恐懼的自由，各國上下却因瘡痍未復，必能發揮其智慧以延　戰禍。在中國，更直接的恐懼來自共產黨的迫害，這迫害除匪軍積行之外，正採取不同的方式如細菌般侵入各部門，於是我們才目擊中國的高等教育陷溺於動盪不安與惴惴恐懼的不自由中，在此一年半載中愈演而愈烈。</p>
<p>大學是自由研究自由講學的文化重鎭，「理知應君臨一切」（引柏拉圖語）。這是西方大學的傳統，也是中國儒家立教的精神。在學府裏，學者未必都能得到「免於匱乏」的自由，（前哲有憂道不憂貧之語，就是今代科學家專力研究「利用厚生」之道，也不是爲自己的衣食）但必然要能爭得「免於恐懼的自由」。爲了道一份自由，人世間不知犧牲了多少志士仁人的生命：自蘇格拉底的受刑，白魯諾的遭害，以及中國展來黨禍與易代中許多學者的殉身，都是著例。五四解除了我們的舊時代剩餘的束縛，尊重理性和信率自由是五四的眞傳統，當然更要摒斥「教條」和迫害人們意志自由的恐懼心。人人有自由，而不侵害別人自由，這是民主的基本要義！充分發揚理智，無所用其對於暴力的戒懼，這是大學的眞精神！</p>
<p>可是一年來中國的大學和專科院校成了什麼景象！我們不忍回溯旣往，只要閉目凝思一個月中不斷演出的以罷課和其他要挾爲方式的學潮。我們不勝枚舉—有如上海法學院和聖約翰的爲展覽而釀成互毆和罷考，南京三大學部份學生之打靑年部，有如浙大部分學追求校長收回開除成命，江西中正大學的張求公費，南敎師院的拒長，浙江英大的搗毀金中，乃至最近上海光華大夏兩大學在大考前夕忽然要求國立，……幾使社會懷疑大學不是研究學術，而只是尋求反對政府題材之一舊中心塲所，使國家教育文化不斷的後退。祇以交通大學爲例，這一年來的交大實在太不安定，太少進步，太失去社會的問情和信譽。六五游行風潮之幸未擴大，市政當局嚴正的質詢程孝剛校長，操縱自治會的學生則巧妙的脅迫程校長，令程校長在此失去「意志自由」的情勢下辭職，行前還對學生發表一番懇切的誥戒。首都各報對他多作過嚴的責備，或說他庇護答國的職業學生，或議他「導之以德」的辦法已失敗無遺，甚有責備他的話「近於租界當局的口吻」。但我們設想程校長的處境，推原他的用心，簡直有些不忍深責這位有心為善，而無法在此環境中堅定辦學的校長。他的心情與行動，幾乎在那失去了「免於恐懼的自由」中而無由自主了，所謂「學生自治會不但從宋領導自治，反而首先破壞而且阻撓學校維持秩序」，所謂本擬解散自治會而終於不成，欲吐又茹，身爲一校之長者如此，校內空氣之如何抑制大多數醇厚的教授和散漫馴怯的學生更可想像了。</p>
<p>平情的觀察，也可明瞭有特殊背景善於控制操縱的少數職業學生，已　入國內著名的大學之中，造成恐懼威脅的空氣，發生破壞秩序損害國家的作用。這批職業學生，有的留學回來仍到大學去插二三年級，有的大學畢業而仍退到中學裏去上課，假使別無用心，何必如此？他們造成恐懼的方式：一是假民主，所領競選，所謂民意測騐，利用多數的無組織與冷淡旁觀，遂行其核心運用，達成其操縱團體之目的。二是暴力，必要時一爲應用，以脅服一部分勇於說話敢立異議的學生。三是宣傳技巧中的謾罵與諷刺，對於與政府比較接近的教授，無論其學望如何，必用盡方法加以詆擊，最好使其畏難而退，次亦不使其在校內有發言的地位；對於强項有正義感的學生，則多方發勸饅屆，便之威爲衆矢之的而不敢作善；對於愛虛榮怕惡名的　　　弱者，或胞之以自由民主的美名，或費之以國特反動一種　露；　於更進一步潛行囊收新分子而加以特殊訓練，則更　　刺加競街的方法表裏配合。此外則更利用時事與經濟的不安，找　每一個問題，以强調政府的無能，充分離間中間分子對國家的向心力。在今日國事與經濟畸形變化之中，教授學者的理智修養，不易十分堅强，學生對於理知訓練更其不够，於是潔身自好的教者，惟恐被「頑腐分子」的惡名；一般見理不明又以無組繳而胆怯的學生，更脅於惡毒議諷與暴力的雙重威脅。我們如要明白少數職業學生如何能在學府中發生大力量，且使每一學潮看來似乎爲一致要求呢，其主要的運用大概如此。</p>
<p>我們從不欲武斷一切學潮是共黨職業學生的演導，而忽視學校內在的不健全的因素，也不能無視今日一般的政治經濟的不安與矛盾。但我們必須指出今日多數學府中的空氣，有這樣奇異而怪誕的一種威脅存在，使大多數學生敢怒而不敢言，使部分學生受蒙蔽煽惑而無形中跟他們呼喊，使一部助教講師也用核心運用方法作他們的外圍，使多數教授有所戒權而緘口，或憤慨發言而亦不發生效力，最後使校長陷於孤立，而竟至懾於他們無理的要求之下。學府不得安定，誤業時斷時續，程度每况愈下，學術日趨倒流，而國家文化教育預算之最大一筆支出幾完全等於白費！</p>
<p>要打破這一種恐懼的空氣，回復大多數教授講學的尊嚴，保障最大多數學生求學的權利與國家學術教育的進步，我們以爲必須富有理智素養的教授與自愛愛國的多數學生，大家堅張的站出來，共同商討，以發揮有組織的道義的力量，而決不是教育行政或地方政警當局所可代謀解決的。只有打破學校中的恐怖威脅，恢復大學裏「免於恐懼的自由」，才能實現我們戡亂建國中高等教育的使命。</p>

<h3>雷厲風行的日本整肅工作</h3>
<p>— 吳嘉棠</p>
<p>一個日本人今天無論有多大抱負，他的出路之有無，須看他在戰時的行爲，和今日盟總對他是否能信任得過，因爲整肅工作在日本，執行相當語眞，我在上文中，曾提到改變日本政治社會和經濟結構的第三枚無形的原十彈，而這種緩性爆炸的主要威力，即來自此種整肅工作。</p>
<p>盟總官員對外人談到整肅工作時，强調這種工作不是懲罰性質，而是預防性質。我對這些理諭問題自慚不加研究，不過從整肅工作的實施過程中，很明顯的缺少報復的行爲，而「整肅」這個字眼在日本，確與有些國家內的集體淸算，野變殘殺，迥然有別。因此，有些主張報復的人們，指責盟總的政策過於寬大，這般喜歡血腥的人，認爲要整肅，就應乾脆的把被淸算的份子列隊槍決，他們不信任在流血之外，尙有其他淸除政敵的辦法。可是，盟總在日本，就不採取這條路綫，他們所用的不流血的方法，也許費時較多，但能收到預期的效果。同時，遺種有秩序的計劃可以防止一個政治上的擾亂，否則變亂發生，將徒然使日共漁翁得利。</p>
<p>日本整肅工作的歷史基礎，可溯源到波茨坦宣言與聯合參謀部給盟總的指令，後者指令盟總淸除「凡是過去的軍國主義者和侵犯份子，或是愛國恐怖團體的有力份子，不使他們再祖任公職或和企業中的重要位置」。此外，凡是在大政翼贊會中的活躍份子，或是對盟軍佔領目標表現敵意的人，均須予以同樣的限制。盟總根據這個訓令，遂於一九四六年一月四日發佈有名的一月四日指令，命令日政府將軍國主義者及侵略份子，一律自政府機關中革除，其中包括下列各類：（一）戰爭罪犯，（二）職業海陸軍人員，特高警察和陸軍部官員，其中包括海陸軍上將，大元帥府軍事參議院，樞密院，陸海軍部高級人員，和所有參加海陸軍警察或情報工作的軍官和軍士，（三）秘密愛國恐怖團體的有力份子，（四）大政翼贊會，與亞報國會及其會社的有力人物，（五）與日本對外長略有關的國策公司的官員，包括「七七事變」至一九四五年九月二日內，那些公司的董事總栽副總裁顧問和佔領區內分公司的經理。（六）佔領區的總督，包括日本戰時殖民帝國一切文武官員在內，（七）一切軍關餘孽和極端民族主義者。指令一經發出，日本政府即於一九四六年二月廿七日建立一個機構，去實施這個訓令。日政府且發表命令，指明那些人可用那些人應屏棄不用，最後並說明檢別工作應如何完成。</p>
<p>在這條法律之下，所有中下級的官吏，以及在政府控制下的公司和團體，和所有預備參加選舉和公務機關的人員，都經過甄審的手續，以決定其是否合格。同時，依據第七類的廣泛規定，日政府公布自中日戰爭發生至日本投降的一段時間內，所有日本有決策實權的最高級官吏名單，附以地位次要的高級官員，並準備淸除一批罪狀昭著的官員，他們的罪狀包括下列若干類：（一）與軸心國家訂約，或與傀儡國家訂約，準備進行所謂「大東亞戰爭」，（二）壓迫反軍國主義者，（三）與被佔領國家締結經濟協定，（四）爲日本軍事活動而設法的財政和生產計劃。此舉之結果，使十八萬三千名的職業陸海軍官和大政翼贊會及其秘密愛國團體人員因此永不叙用。同時，由於日政府對於盟總指令所作的解釋，下議院議員中，凡曾被東條政府保薦參加過去選舉者，均不准參與公務。</p>
<p>當初步整肅工作急速開展的時候，盟總又在一九四六年八月發佈另一個聲明，擴大肅淸的工作範圍，自最上層擴展到下層，旁及新聞，藝術，和科學的領域。同時盟總復規定：在第一個指令下所未列入的份子，亦一律不得參加國會的上下兩院和地方議會，而被整肅的人們，以後再不准供職於政治經濟組織中。</p>
<p>根據盟總的文吿，日政府撥出一個檢別和斥除的新標準，內容廣泛，包括中央和地方政府的一切職位，許多公司內的職員，和報紙雜誌的總編輯主筆和記者。這條法律處罰下列幾種人：（一）主使戰爭，（二）壓制反戰份子，（三）贊成獨栽制度，（四）統制言論，（五）對佔領區實施政治操縱及經濟剝削。（六）推行戰時總動員的重要計劃。這條法律牽涉了一大批爲侵略主義張目的文人和藝術工作者。其中遭受整肅者，均爲通過其政治或哲學的理論，爲「大東亞主義」及「東亞新秩序」等政策，建立理論上及意識上的基礎。除此之外，那些有勢力的國策公司和其大公司亦自上至下受到整肅。同時，這條法律的另一用意，，在使政府舞台上能多多出現新人，所以親定凡在一九四五年九月一日至一九四六年九月一日任職的市長，副市長各區區長，在未來四年之內，不能參加任何選舉。　當整肅工作逐步推進之時，問題開始觸及所謂「無形戰犯」這是指參與政洽活動但是並不列入上述各類的日本人而言。這批也被日政府個別提名，逐步的整肅了，由於整肅範圍之廣泛，有人說被排出政府之外的份子，已經轉入地下活動。我在東京時，曾設法去研究是否有一個有勢力的地下政府存在。我從各方面探求，包括好幾位情報靈通而可靠的新聞記者，可是沒有一位能確切的吿訴我日本目前有這樣一個有計劃有組織的地下議構。以作者所搜集的證據而論，實不能證明有所謂地下運動，一定要說有的話，那恐是指日共爲主持的秘密活動了。</p>

<h3>南國四領袖失歡於蘇聯　鐵幕內部顯露分裂　狄托元帥可能已遭看管　南政府將發聲明答覆共產國際譴責</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕倫敦廿九日廣播：南斯拉夫官方通訊社消息，南政府有關共產國際情報局之聲明，預料將於本日下午六時左右發表。</p>

<p>〔路透社華盛頓廿八日電〕此問具有豐富經騐之外交家，認爲共產情報局之公開譴責狄托元帥，係表示狄托已被「看管」，不復爲貝爾格勒之積極領導者。有兩點可以確定者，乃爲（一）共黨首腦部今將不得不處理東歐集團中之第一次重大分裂；（二）共黨首腦部想必先採行動，然後始公開譴責，蓋許多年來蘇聯內外之共黨於實施整肅之際，莫不採取此一手段。</p>
<p>〔路透社倫敦廿八日電〕莫斯科經由共產國際情報局之宣言，實際上等於號召南斯拉夫人民反抗其政府及領袖。共產情報局之號召南斯拉夫共黨之忠實黨員更易其領袖，實即令彼等採取反抗政府之直接行動。共產情報局譴責最甚的南國共黨四大領袖，即狄托元帥·倫柯維克·吉拉斯及卡臺爾治四人，乃今日掌握南斯拉夫全國之人物。狄托以抗戰英雄之身份，以總理而兼國防部長，必可獲得南國常備軍大部份軍人之效忠。倫柯維克居內長之職，控制全國警察，包括效能極高之政治警察。卡臺爾治於抗戰時代，素被目爲狄托之智張，乃南斯拉夫共黨的靈魂，渠並爲南國外交政策之主要指導者，上週參與華沙會議之外長西密克，固僅一裝飾品而已。至於不管部長吉拉斯，乃狄托系中之爆炸性有力份子，亦爲抗戰英雄出身，與陸軍關係密切。故被譴責的南共領袖，實即南斯拉夫全國的神經中樞，苟無外界强國之直接千涉，尙不知如何可由南共之所謂忠實同志，更易此四大領袖。關係方面並信狄托元帥以抗戰英雄之身份，領導戰後之南斯拉夫，故國內之非共黨份子，對渠亦有好感。共產情報局之譴責狄托，不啻目狄托爲捍衛南國獨立以抗莫斯科之干涉者，勢必使南斯拉夫人民愈益增强其對狄托之好感。</p>
<h3>對南斯拉夫事件　各國觀感不同　認為可加速對奧和約完成　特港問題亦可獲早日解決</h3>
<p>〔路透社倫敦廿九日電〕據悉，南斯拉夫政府將於卅日發表聲明，答覆共產情報局對南國共黨及其首腦部的指責。巴黎方面各共黨議員均保持械默，惟右翼份子則認南國共黨領袖之被逐出共產情報局，乃使西方國家安心的現象，亦爲東歐國家應有所警惕的教訓。羅馬人士對此訊甚感興奮，預料南斯拉夫今後可與義更爲接近，而解決兩國間之一切懸題。</p>
<p>倫敦人士亦認狄托與莫斯科之破裂，可望促成特港問題的解決，加速對奧和約的完成，减輕共黨對希臘的壓迫，而鐵幕後的分裂將使蘇聯不致就柏林危機與西方國家火併。</p>
<p>〔合衆社成功湖廿九日電〕聯合國人士對狄托事件。採靜觀態度，認爲須多得消息，始能明白全盤。然多人與華府倫敦官員態度一致，以爲蘇聯在公佈決裂前，必有控制南斯拉夫之把握。</p>
<h3>我政界人士看法</h3>
<p>〔合衆社南京廿九日電〕高級政治圈內人士對南斯拉夫被摒出蘇聯之衛星圈，表示興奮，認爲係西方國家之重大勝利，但若千觀察家則警吿勿過份樂觀。有人預測蘇聯將對其他衛星國加緊鎭壓，同時可能對東亞重新運用大規模之壓力。另有人稱，此可能係一「似爲重要而實無價値之發現」，「任何來自共產黨之禮物，必須孜思考慮其良竄一。渠又稱，「此項消息太好了，幾乎將疑其非眞」。</p>
<p>但一致之意見均認爲蘇聯已喪失其最主要之歐洲堡壘，因此大大地削减了史達林的實力。有人並稱，今後蘇聯冷戰戰略之主要基地，將爲特里埃斯特，希臘及義大利了，另一國民黨高級官員稱，蘇聯之擴展主義已與其衛星國之民族主義發生衝突，其間之差別實無法調和，巴爾幹諸國爲主要農業國家，渠等實希望與西歐之工業國家合作，雖然渠等與蘇聯同屬斯拉夫民族。馬歇爾方案巳對蘇聯之衛星國。給以絕大之引誘，而趨於不穩，同樣之事件可能隨時間之進展而明朗化，但蘇聯則無疑將「在其鐵幕上加釘盤釘」。</p>

<p>〔路透社柏林廿九日電〕西方强國自空中及水道載運糧食接濟柏林，可望使蘇聯對柏林西區之封鎖失去效用。四引擎巨型機四十架每機可載貨七噸，已於今日起加入英夫之雙引擎運輸機，往來柏林與西德間輸送糧食。另有運貨船廿三艘可望於今日自漢堡駛抵柏林。向蘇登記德國新聞社並曰，東西德國間之德人旅客，持有過境通行證者，已可自由往來惟鐵路交通一時尙不致恢復。</p>

<h3>共黨情報局宣言　嚴厲譴責南領袖　指所施政策背悖列寗馬克思主義</h3>
<p>〔路透社普拉格廿八日電〕共產黨報紙「人權報」頃揭載共產情報局最近在羅馬尼亞舉行會議後之公報，實際等於開除南斯拉夫總理狄托元帥之黨籍，並號召南共忠實同志更易其領袖。公報指責狄托領導之南國共黨，已默認資本主義國家對於南國獨立的威脅在蘇聯之下的政策，並從事反蘇之宣傳，採取危險的對蘇聯及對蘇聯共黨態度，不信任蘇聯在南之專家，竟以保安警察監視其行動，因此共產情報局確認南斯拉夫共黨業已採取悖棄馬克斯主義及列寗主義的錯誤政策，脫離統一的社會主義政策，而步向背叛勞工階級國際團結的途徑。承認蘇聯共黨中央委員會之舉發南共中央委員會，尤其是狄托與卡臺爾治兩領袖的錯誤政策，確有其事。公報曰，，查得南共領袖開始採取認蘇聯爲隧迫者的態度，對蘇聯共黨及蘇聯領袖一再毀謗，其反蘇態度堪稱空前未有，使東歐國家之領導地位業已感受威脅南共內部業已發生分裂，然內外人士對南共迭有批評，而南共竟對批評者以最殘暴的報復，黨員最簡單的權利竟亦遭否認，被逐被捕之事迭有所關。此外更頒布無理法律，使小型商肆亦歸國有，並使自耕農戶貿然組織，此等揹施未經準備而貿然以政令行之，必致引起嚴重後果。本局確認南共領袖之反黨及反蘇意見及行動，以及彼等之拒絕出席本局此次之會議，已脫離反帝國主義之統一社會主義陣綫，而步向悖棄勞工階級國際團結之途徑。本局茲鄭重宣布南共中央委員會已因此而使其本身及南共脫離共產方黨之家屬，而退出共產統一陣綫及共產情報局之外。本局相信此乃由於過去五六月來南共內部隱匿的國家主義份子，巳公然挿足南共首腦部之故。南共領袖對其本國實力估計，未免太高，誤以爲不經蘇聯等他國共黨之支援，即有建立其社會主義之可能。彼等受帝國主義者之恫嚇，以爲可以傾向資本主義，而博取帝國主義者的歡心，成立關於南國獨立之協議。彼等默示接受布爾喬亞的國家主義，以爲資本主義國家，對於南國獨立的威脅，尙在蘇聯之下。本局相信南國國內，必有相當數量忠於馬克思及列寗主義的信徒，能强迫其領袖糾正其政策，而重返國際主義之途。不然，此等領袖務須予以更易，相信共黨必能履行此一光榮的任務。</p>

<h3>熔售金條操縱黑市　當局破獲重要機構　主持人被捕後當夜保釋</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕本市昨破獲一駭人聽聞之黑市金鈔機關，該機關主持人不獨有操縱全市黑市金鈔之魄力，且對外自稱與若干有地位之負責當局交誼頗深，縱橫黑市，毫無忌憚。該機關並自備熔爐，冒充若干大同行金號脾照，私自滲入雜質，製造成色不足之「足赤」，三閱月來，受害者不知凡幾。迨至最近爲本市最高治安當局獲悉上項情形，遂於昨日以迅雷不及掩耳之行動，會同有關機關人員前往查獲。該機關係設於江西中路三三一號，原爲吉泰銀號，現則改爲吉泰紗號，主持人爲胡信義。據悉，胡自當局宣佈加强取締黑市金鈔買賣後，彼即四出活動，旋與某機關人員發生關係，嗣即利用此項關係，大事招搖，並在該號三樓自備熔爐，將黑市中收聯之金條私自滲入雜質減低成份，重行熔化成條，再輾轉出售，每日由渠熔製藉黑市流出之金條，數以百計，每售出一條，渠即可於成色內獲純利一兩，以是秘密經營，積貲無算。惟胡於被捕後，矢口否認有犯罪行爲，承辦機關於訊問之後，當晚即令交保暫釋，候再偵查核辦。</p>

<p>市兵役協會昨開第十次常會。該會因自公教人員及工人繳納安家費辦法更改後，影響收入約四千億，最近新兵對第二期安家費，要求配發實物，於是安家費更感不敷。昨日開會時，經討論決定：（一）第二期新兵安家費發放時，另予補助，其數字俟再討論。（二）對七月份安家費之發放，九次常會中曾決定按六月份配米價格發放，現經討論後，決定改照七月份配米發給。（三）五六兩月之新兵安家費，迄今僅收足十分之三，不數發放，待下次會議再行商討。</p>
<h3>參議大會定今日休會　昨通過調整汽車市政建設捐捐率　並對非機動車普遍徵捐</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕市參議會第六次大會，昨召開第六次會議。預定付議之提案百餘件，結果僅社會組及市長議長交議之提案小部份討論完畢，無法於昨日如期休會。經大會通過延會一天。散會前，通過陳保泰等廿九人臨時動議一件，「請市政府嚴厲禁止假借名義，冒充民意，聚衆請願，以平亂源案。辦法：（一）各請願團應切實邀守中央規定，請願時派遣代表不得超過十人。（二）請願代表必須携有國民身份證，職業證及職業團體之證件。（三）如再有集中請願情事，應請警局嚴加制止。</p>

<h3>中紡工人發起　搶吃運動　顯為受人利用　當局嚴加防範</h3>
<p>上海社訊：中紡十七廠部份工人，藉口因物價暴漲，無法維持生計，乃於日前召集該廠工人十餘，發起「搶吃運動」，是日上午由此項工人計劃，擬於午膳時發動首次搶吃運動，奈因事機不密，爲廠方得悉，乃加預防，結果未達目的，是夜十二時，當職員及機器問領班吃半夜餐時，該批工人復乘勢擁入搶吃，幸有準備，仍未成功，惟將職員之肉菜等悉數搶走。二十七日各工人復以「搶吃運動」爲要挾，要求各機器問人領班向廠方提出要求五項：（一）每人借支五十萬元，（二）依照民營廠待遇，每工友每月津貼白米二斗，（三）要求廠方一律供給膳食一次，（四）每人普加工資三角，（五）每人發給工衣一套，然二十八日養當廠長召集該廠機器間領班及各科室負責人會議時，機器間領班並未將工人五項要求提出，工人等見目的未達，乃於是日中午機器間領班進膳時，復聚集百餘工人，阻止機器問領班進膳爲示威，一面與其他各廠潰極聯絡，擬擴大該項運動，現中紡各廠亦正紛紛醞釀中，相繼發生類似運動者，有中舫三廠，中紡四廠，中紡十廠，中紡十二廠，中紡十四廠，中紡十九廠等，事態頗爲嚴重。又滬東中紡第一針綫廠，昨日上午十時，亦有工人二百餘名，企岡響應發動是項「搶吃運動」，事爲廠方得悉，恐事態擴大，乃電吿楊樹浦警局，派大批員警赴廠防範，得未發生意外。</p>
<p>有關當局以此類非法運動，影響治安，且此次發動者，僅部份工人，故顯爲部份工人受奸匪煽動操縱所致，除嚴密注意防範，以免事態擴大外，並已對爲首份子加以監視，故此項事態，日內可望平定云。</p>
<h3>要求漲價　最後手段　西片商停止供新片　影院業今緊急會議　可能洽映最新國片以渡「難關」</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕本市九家西片商，因不滿目前各影院票價過低，且歷次要求調整，均未達理想，故已毅然於前日起停止供給新片。最近一月來，影院業內部問題重重，目前更因西片商停供新片益趨複雜代：在社會局方面，認爲影院業公會必與西片商沆瀣一氣，致屢提無理要求；而西片商方面，則又始終認爲影院業公會與社會局保有默契，故對渠等每次要求均故作刁難。同時二三四輪影院又因前次反對首輸限價過低未果，對公會，社局，及首輪各院均表反感。但各首輪影院苦悶亦多，渠等未嘗不欲依據西片商之標準實行漲價，以提高本身營業收入，惟因一方面難望當局核准，他方面亦顧慮過高票價是否能獲得觀衆歡迎。故在各方踟蹰猶豫之情形下，西片商乃擇取最後手段，停供新片，以示抗議。聞在此事宣吿決裂前，曾有人提議，除最低限價外，不妨將首輪影院票價加以彈性規定，以底數五角按每半月生活指數計算，俾求一勞永逸。但此事社局表示不予考慮，而西片商亦表示對此數不能滿意。現影院業公會爲打開僵局，決於今日下午召開緊急會議，並邀各有關方面參加研討，以尋覓一較爲合理之解決方法。在此具體辦法未獲社局，西片商之滿意前，本市各首輪影院預告之新片，將無法上映。惟渠等已準備在舊片售座低落時，決向國產影片商洽映最新國片，以渡過此一靑黃不接之時期。</p>

<h3>書夜請願終獲解決　私小敎師滿意歸去　市長允每人先發貸金五百萬</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕本市私立小學教師爲貸金與配米事，自前日下午三時先後集有二三百人，向教育局請願。因教育局之答覆，渠等認爲不能滿意，　集林森中路馬當路一帶澈夜不散，圍坐達且。昨日下午四時許教育界人士杜佐周，楊衛王，陳伯吹等到塲勸吿，報吿與吳市長交涉經過，請願羣衆深受感動，至六時許遂相率離去。前後僵持達二十七小時之久，幸當局處理穩健，未肇事端，堪稱幸事</p>
<p>昨晨四時許，天降豪雨，團坐教局門前請願羣衆，不堪雨淋，紛向附近一帶商店着下避雨。申江醫院及若干商店並自動開門，招待教師入內休息，供給茶水。</p>
<p>小學生結隊慰問　淸晨七時許，小學生陸續結隊慰問教師，並在附近勸募購買燒餅油條，供給老師充飢。前後小學生集合一百餘人。林森中路教育局大門未開，請願羣衆即在大門合階上作司令台，領導者數人在上發號施令，上貼「反飢餓場」四大字，並懸掛各處送來之慰勞鼓勵旗幟，有交大自治會，師專，幼專，萬方綢布商店，一羣家長，一羣中學生，中華職校，……大小旗幟十三面。牆上滿貼紅綠標語，漫畫，幾無隙地。在歌高呼，此起彼伏，哂雜與緊張迷於極點。</p>
<p>警局戒備森嚴，汽車與行人均不許通過，對教師行動則不千涉，自始至終，相安無事。</p>
<p>三傳達員小波折　晨十時許傳達員三人晋謁教局請示，仍不肯道出姓名與服務學校，當經教局查出，其中一人係檢舉李澤之舒月橋，渠現爲新新公司員工子弟學校教員，惟該校未經教局立案。其餘二人暫予扣留，嗣查明一爲黃俊（女，勤德小學幼稚園），一爲陳明（男，華民小學），因其具有教員身份，旋即釋放。</p>
<p>四點要求　獲得答復</p>
<p>下午四時許，教界人士杜佐周，楊衛玉，陳伯吹，偕國教處長朱君惕抵塲，引起羣衆極大興奮。杜佐周首稱；希望此事不要擴大，渠與吳市長李局長交涉經過，對各位所要求四點答覆如下：（一）貸款一千萬元，先由市銀行借款六百億，每人先發五百萬元，其餘五百萬元，則在放暑假前，向四聯總處接洽撥發。（二）配米問題，有許多學校未領到米的原因，是由於民調會人少不够運用，致有遲延，惟欠米決保證在短期內發淸，以後如發現有霍米，報吿教育局向民調會調換。（三）七月至九月暑假期間配米維持原價問題，不是教育局所能作主，但敎局負責向有關方面交涉。至繳還戶口米一斗事，敎局不知此事，負責向民調會交涉。（四）增加十三萬元補助費問題，自下學期起，教育局決向市參議會力爭提高。繼由楊衛玉，陳伯吹等勸導請願羣衆，語多勗勉安慰。朱君惕則勸各人散去，返家休息，提出要求均可望解決。</p>
<p>臨行高呼感謝</p>
<p>請願羣衆至此亦巳力竭聲嘶，疲累不堪，見問題已獲相當解決，不復堅持。中間雖有邰爽秋與舒月橋聲稱吳市長僅答應五百萬，其餘五百萬借到就發，借不到不發，認爲杜等前後矛盾，幾又引起風波，幸情勢已見緩和，且私立教師信任杜等保證，於六時前陸續散去。在決定離開前，小學教師代表一人起立高呼：「我們這次請願已獲有相當結果，謝謝各位警察先生，記者先生，和關心我們的社會人士！」二十七小時之紛擾，終吿平息。</p>
<h3>教育局長發表書面談話</h3>
<p>教育局李局長昨發表書面談話稱：私立小學員工待遇，原應由各校董事會及校長負責，本局可不加顧問，惟近時物價高漲，本局體念教師生活艱苦，除已請市府發放補助費二十億津貼教職員外，並請市長向民調會商請發給平價配米，及向四聯總處商洽貸款，在私校教師福利方面，教育局自問已盡一分責任，乃少數私校教師未明經過，來局請願，堅欲教育局担保私校教師各借一千萬元，限期本月底以前必須撥借，不知教育局非貸款機關，强教育局負不能負之責任，可謂對象認識不淸，後經市長召集私校教職員團體代表正式答覆，在四聯總處未核准以前，先由市銀行墊借，以濟眉急，並准每人得貸五百萬元，合計六百五十億元，各代表多認爲圓滿，乃各請願人，猶結集不散，查此次請願代表，經警局盤詢，發現有少數身份不明者，混雜其間，小學生參入其中者，亦有多人，其行動類不類正常教師團體，是否受人利用，本局正查究中，此次承警察總局及嵩山分局員警，日夜維特秩序，致未有意外事件發生，本局實深感謝。</p>

<h3>金管局協助平抑物價　大規模檢查行莊　標據倉庫押欵均在檢查之列</h3>
<p>上海金管局爲平抑物價，特配合市政當局，採取緊急措施。自廿八日起，已加緊檢查行莊。所有該局總稽核以下人員，均全體出動，並向中央銀行稽核處借調大批職員協助工作，爲該局成立以來第一次大規樸之檢查。動員人數之多，檢查範圍之廣，爲歷次所未有。該局此次檢查計有三大目標：（一）檢查票據交換所行莊可疑之票據，（二）檢查行莊往來可疑之客戶，（三）檢查行莊附設倉庫押款帳單。以上三種情形，均足以造成囤積操縱，投機牟利之事實。影響所及，殊屬嚴重。該局此次檢查，如發現有可疑情事，及投機囤積之貨物，即依法嚴辦。至前經處分之行莊，如撤換經理等，正俟財部命令到達，即可依法辦理。</p>
<h3>游資不斷流來　華股市程平穩</h3>
<p>華股昨晨疲繼俏，游資動向，仍在不斷流來，是以業中心意雖淡，假期負担及種種陰霾，在半途曾一掃而空，小型股及雄股之襯托殷切，情景差堪吿慰。</p>
<p>晨開時，因業中陰影及證交某大員赴京，人心見疲而開低盤。永紗以五二〇〇元登塲，一六三號一五七號及銀行帮賣到五一四〇元，一七六號一四五號等來進，升爲五三二〇元。代辦費開七一元及七七元，須五天負荷，不免小盤。終以游資四處滲入，小股維牌頗見買力，內衣華新麗安漲停，證券帮廣帮都進，而漲到五四一〇元。港電微升爲一角半，一〇四號一三號八九號及廣帮二〇二號不斷力售，一五五號及銀行帮亦有了結，午收退爲五二三〇元。較前收除麗安內衣華新漲停，新光尙平，永紗信和景福統益榮豐五和閘北微降，餘均微升。塲外各未上市股票除世界升一成，大生好半成外，餘均平穩。</p>
<p>公債　昨稍軟弱，統丙晨開六二萬，曾升至六五萬，而後下挫至五六萬，始呈盤旋。成交三百萬，較前收計甲乙丁戊各低二萬元，丙挫一萬元。</p>
<p>外股　昨以當局監視及種種顧忌。交易不能正常展開，延至十一時半，始獲做開。港電微升爲一角半，怡紗曾低至一〇一〇萬關，大部時間在一〇五〇萬左右徘徊，較前收計怡紗紙版低半成，航業跌一成，餘均微挫。</p>
<h3>行莊六底結算　市面銀根略緊</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕六月巳屆，商業行莊半年結算，市面銀根略緊，物價漲勢亦見綏和；行莊定明日起，休息兩日。據悉本市行莊，大體均頗有盈餘，其中資金雄厚經營得法者，且獲利甚豐，除提去公積金捐稅員工紅酬等一切開支外，每一元之股本，可得二千元左右之純利。惟自銀行之存款總額折合物價分析，則目前行莊之實力實甚空虛，戰前銀行之資力，可充分控制工業，目前則爲在經濟往來關係上，銀行實隸屬於工廠，所謂景氣者，除少數擁有外匯頭寸者外，全屬表面之現象</p>
<p>昨日銀根因六底比期日近，國家行局又復從事抽緊。銀錢票據交換中，行局共差進一四五九七億，中央銀行差進七一七四億，中國銀行差出四一七九億，交通銀行差進三八〇九億，農民銀行差進八三九億，中信局差進五八四二億，郵匯局差出四六一億，中央合作金庫差進一五七三億。商業行莊大交換差出一四二八四億，小交換差出一〇七四二億。外商銀行差進數量創空前紀錄，總額達一〇七四二億元。</p>
<h3>行莊調撥頭寸　國行準予匯兌</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕開放內匯已於前日起實行，惟僅限於同業匯款，無論國家行局或商業行莊調撥頭寸，央行均可無限制予以匯兌，地區包括全國各地。據悉今日先辦國家行局之匯款，明日起商業行莊匯款開始舉辦。</p>
<h3>各地商情</h3>
<p>蘇州　〔本報蘇州廿九日電〕蘇州今日米價，正式宜吿下跌。市塲做開上糙粳一三四〇萬元，較上日低一一〇萬元。上白粳一六二〇萬元·跌卅萬元。門售議價一六二〇萬元，可購得中白米。</p>
<p>無錫　〔本報無錫廿九日電〕各物去化呆滯，均在疲途徘徊。白粳一六二二萬元，白元一六三七萬元，羊秈一六三七萬元，埠秈一六〇二萬元，外江秈一五五二萬元，興化秈一五五二萬元，小麥一〇七〇萬元，白麥一一一〇萬元，麵粉四八七萬元，荳油三七〇〇萬元，棉紗六四〇〇〇萬元。</p>

<h3>洋米棉花運滬</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕華綸洋行經理之大中山輪，自美舊金山裝來食米二萬六千七百三十包，昨晨抵滬，現泊日暉港碼頭起卸。又渣華公司新輪雪爾佛皮拉爾號，自美經印度孟買來滬，已於廿七日到埠，裝來棉花一萬二千九百三十餘件，薄柴油一千七百二十噸，現泊德士古，俟油卸淸，改泊公和祥碼頭起卸棉花。</p>
<h3>場外售價高檔盤旋　食米仍無正式交易　麵粉貨主心餒價見下游</h3>
<p>米市仍以社局限制照上週五之價，無人售出，雖然產地已見回短，但較之上週五之價仍高，仍無正式交易。民調會照常拋米六千石，價亦照舊，塲外交易價仍站高峯。白粳，薄稻各爲一千八百五十萬，早稻一千七百五十萬，江西機秈一千七百萬，糙粳一千五百五十萬元。今日起糧市因半年決算休市三天。</p>
<p>麵粉交易正常，價格稍見下游，因無錫價格猛降，及銀根緊俏，貨主心虛，相繼吐售，尤以雜牌粉供應更多。老車粉四百八十五萬，兵船四百七十五萬，一致退入限價，約較上日降二十萬左右。麩皮三百九十萬原價，小麥六百萬開出。</p>
<p>雜糧仍無正式交易，進出雙方，大都觀望，至收市始稍做開，站在上週五之價，漢口乍豆八百二十萬，車豆入百八十萬，毛家市靑蠶無袋船貨開七百二十萬，元麥交易較多，崑山元麥六百卅萬，常敦元麥六百四十萬，次奶蔴一千八百萬元</p>
<p>食油祇有各油廠爲供應市需開售豆油，價較上週五之收市價低五萬元，爲二千七百四十五萬元，各廠一律，此亦非正式之交易。係協助抑平價格而特開低者。惟粥少僧多，向隅者甚多。此外小車蔴油爲四千九百萬元，豆餅初市廠方開四百〇四萬，後散戶迫於銀根，吐售甚多，生仁記餅退爲三九五萬，較上日暗市小三四十萬元。</p>
<h3>統購棉花核價辦法　經部核準施行</h3>

<h3>銀根緊縮買氣銷沉　棉紗布喊價疲輭</h3>
<p>昨日棉紗市况，因塲內經警監視綦嚴，門外亦禁止一切閑人觀望，業內人心慘淡，且六底結賬期近，銀根趨緊，客銷呆滯，多頭紛紛吐售，市勢不支下挫。四十二支藍鳳細紗，遲至十一點一刻開做，以八億元低盤開出，中途欲振乏力，後以散戶見低吸納，升至八億三千萬元結束，比上日跌落五千萬元，其餘各支粗細紗亦普降一成至成半左右。</p>
<p>昨日棉布市况，因龍頭細布及四君子嗶嘰供求尙未正常，塲內仍禁做，但塲外喊價已呈疲軟，良以投機帮咸抱觀望，新買與老多頭轉售甚衆，龍頭細有已二千零七十萬步降至一千九百五十萬元，最後二千萬元亦有賣出，四君子嗶嘰亦小至二千零八十萬結束，較上日塲外降落一百五六十萬元，塲內五福細布狂瀉二百卅萬元。此外惟士林布及藍布元布等續俏，其餘則升沉不一。</p>

<h3>新詩詮意</h3>
<p>— 雨琴</p>
<p>一　相思　冰心</p>
<p>躱開相思。</p>
<p>教上裘兒。</p>
<p>走出燈明人靜的屋子。</p>
<p>小徑裏明月相　，</p>
<p>枯枝——</p>
<p>在雪地上</p>
<p>又縱橫的寫遍了相思。</p>
<p>今之縣愛二字，正如中國古語之相思。此詩題日相思，蓋　慰愛之總統也。前段寫其避免戀愛之情緒。凡戀愛情緒之來臨，必由種種景物以蓋起之，所謂觸景生情是也。而在間之景物，在室內者莫如孤燈，孤燈而伴孤客，其燈光反映出人影，照耀壁上，回首一視，頓感孤寞，於是戀愛之情緒生焉。情緒雖生而情人難觀，故不得不因「今夜鐙前形共影」，而生「更無人與共春寒」之惑。此詩乃寫冬夜，故後段言及雪地，冬寒遠非春寒可比，則其所感之深，亦峧他季爲甚。設殘燈暗淡，朦朧欲睡，如所謂，靑缸暗明滅」者，因其所映之影不明，故戀愛之情緒生而不深，慮而不大；若燈光爍然，、燈花正放，如所謂「淸夜一燈明、者，因其所映之影顯明，故戀愛之情緒生而且深，感而且大。加以更闌人靜，所謂「夜巳三更」及一人悄悄」之時，已足為此一更深人去寂靜」，而引起無限戀愛之情緒，况更有「但照壁孤燈相映」者乎？是夜也，獨處空房，守着燈兒，縱令剪盡燈花，反增愁緒，威德不云乎：「撥燈書盡紅箋也，依舊無聊」，李淸照亦曾「夜闌猶剪燈花弄」，其弄燈花之由，蓋「獨抱濃愁無好夢」也，以其如是，曷不離此空房，別此孤燈，效古女之「獨步出幽關」，出外漫步，以遣愁懷，然室外溫度，不逮室內，夜關尤甚，故不得不打開衣機，取裘兒一獎著之，然後離室。後段寫其不期而招致　愛情緒之製來。人世之事，大凡有意害之，而適足以主成之，有意避之，而適足以邂逅之。此詩主人公旣已離室，獨往小徑漫步，滿以爲能藉此遣散愁懷，即令愁懷不克全部遣散，亦當去其大半愁絲，而事乃大謬不然。依依之月，不但今夜有，且今夜月偏明，明而至於無　不照，無所逃匿，如人之窺物，務在必獲，於是此詩之主人公又被比燈光更明之月所發現，人影在地，形隻影單，而原欲避去之戀愛情緒，忽又來襲——行伍浩蕩，啣枚疾走，偷入心臟之都——而萬縷愁絲，由是生矣。此猶未也，再視皚皚雪地，月照倍潔，其上似有戀愛之情緒之字樣；左右遍佈，觸目皆是。一察其故，則見老樹之枯枝爲月影所照映，而枯枝乃如數百枝毛穎，藉此難得之白紙大寫其戀愛之情緒之字樣，於是此詩之主人公雖欲避免戀愛之情緒，而在在足以惹起其更大更深之戀愛之情緒矣。</p>
<p>此詩言簡情深。意在言外，頗得舊詩詞之旨。而末一句乃由周美成六醜：「恐斷紅尙有相思字」化出，愈足見其對舊詩詞之善於借用。</p>
<p>二　紙船寄母親　冰心</p>
<p>我從不肯妄棄一張紙</p>
<p>總是留着—留着，</p>
<p>疊成一隻很小的船兒，</p>
<p>從卅上拋下在海裏</p>
<p>有的被天風吹捲到舟中的窗裏，</p>
<p>有的被海浪打濕，沾在船頭上</p>
<p>我仍是不灰心的每天的壘着，</p>
<p>總希望有一隻能流到我要他到的地方去。</p>
<p>母親；倘若你夢中看見一隻很小的白船兒，</p>
<p>不要驚訝他無端入夢。</p>
<p>這是你至愛女兒含着淚疊的，</p>
<p>萬水千山，求他載着他的愛和悲哀歸去。</p>
<p>此詩製題，非但新頴，且寓意遙深。如單看紙船二字，便覺單調，且帶孩子味；如再看寄母親三字，便覺詩意雅醇，雖帶孩子味，愈足見其無比之天眞矣。前段寫其疊紙船拋在海裏。凡孩子之心，多富稚氣。孩子因玩時較多，故其玩物亦不鮮，求其玩物之最，則莫如疊紙戲。余少時亦曾嗜此，將紙疊成無數形狀，有衣褲，有棹椅，有塔，亦有船，而船因能　　水面，隨風遠送，最爲余喜，他童亦然。此詩之作，雖作者以第一人稱寫之，而實含有普遍之孩子羣於其中。蓋孩子生活寫照之鱗爪也。疊紙船以不見縐紋爲佳，一次疊成，小巧玲瓏，放其河中，飄浮永面，隨風遠送，然有幽緻。但作者却不放其河中，而拋在海裏，因此詩乃作者述赴重洋去國後之听作也。中段寫其紙船之遭遇及其工作之繼續。船因量輕質薄，海水又復洶湧如狂，遂不克保特其原有順流之速度與定向，其不被淹沒幸矣！而被吹捲入舟窗者有之，沾在船頭上者有之，然作者對此小紙船之寄託深遠，決不因此挫折而遂　手不疊，故仍繼續作其每日疊船之工作。末段寫其轉紙船之由。大凡游子離鄉，皆有思鄉之感。離鄉愈遠，其感愈深，行經萬水千山，而其思鄉之情亦有萬斛千鐘。然此萬水千山之中之一山一水，皆萱韓依閭听盼，若思及慈鳥反哺，則不獲歸養之孝思，油然而生。「歸夢查　屏山烟樹」，已屬思鄉，若再有外界之景物以刺激之，如「嗎嗷林鳥」或「寒杵搗鄉愁」，則不禁「眷戀庭聞」之思起，而『日暮鄉關何處是』之愁生矣。是日也，游子鄉關之感、風人屺岵之思，殆無時獲已。作者此詩不僅欲寫其思母，亦欲寫其母愛。慈母愛子之心，無微不至，其子遠游，則依門而望，或待其歸來，或待其平安之書；夜則夢見其　，「高堂應夢歸」者是也。然如夢中忽來一隻小白船兒，則不免驚訝，何則？因其無端入夢也。若知此小白船兒之來歷，爲其至愛之女兒所含淚疊成，且船中所載者，又皆爲女兒之愛與悲哀，則爲慈母者，亦將悲喜交集矣。風霜勞頓，所以患也，忽得生訊，所以落也。若是，則母女之情感，賴此小白船兒之助，獲以交匯焉。</p>
<p>此詩思鄉懷母，借物託情，得心性之正。末布或可謂其來自：『鄉書何隨達，歸雁洛陽遵』。此詩之小白船兒雖非鄉書，然所載之希望與鄉書等，所異者，其綠衣人一爲雁，一爲海水也。</p>
<p>七種週刋自七月一日起暫行停刋，本刊及出版界週刊尙有稿費數起，以地址不明，無從寄發。務盼原作者即以近址見示，以情手績。</p>

<h3>白荷</h3>
<p>— 進琉</p>
<h3>畫境</h3>
<p>— JS</p>
<p>——天方日談之一</p>
<p>心裏有一幅畫境：斜陽古渡，歸鴉數點，煙波渺茫，炊烟裊裊，沉靜的，一切都是沉靜的，林際一抹暮靄，籠罩着黃昏的靜穆。</p>
<p>我憧憬着心裏的畫境。</p>
<p>——忽然間，暮色朦職中緩緩移過一條黑影，從林中走向渡頭，　忽而又遲緩的，沉重而又急促的，有此像是夢游病患者，慢慢的我聽到一種聲音，似乎是「大雷雨」那齣戲裏的那位瘋老太婆，幽靈似的出規在眼前，奔着喊着：</p>
<p>「暴風雨快來了，——世界的末日到啦！」重複而艱澀的聲音，在暮靄中顫抖着，迴盪着，親切而熟悉，　　又是一位熟職的朋友，皺着一付苦臉，捧緊一顆沉鬰的心，有氣無力的在水畔躑躅，在渡頭呻吟，在暮色蒼茫中悲嘆。</p>
<p>突然一聲爆炸，猶先前的聲音，不過已經變成火山　發前的預兆，喊道：「上海難，上海灘，——上海快灘啦！」</p>
<p>於是我驀然憬悟，他徘徊的地方不是什麼畫境，也沒有斜陽古渡，顯在我們眼前的正是黃浦外灘。</p>
<p>再聽聽那喊聲，一會兒遠，一會兒近，一會完　亮，一會兒沉寂；那喊着的不是什麼朋友，也不是什麼瘋子，而是一個失足沉溺在江虞的人。我嚇慌了，再仔細一看，他　身一變，立刻化成千百個沉溺的人，眼前的黃浦江已變成地獄變相區中露出的奈何橋下的血污池，掉在水裏的男男女女，宛如浦東渡江的菜販，在江心打翻了一筐蘿葡，蘿葡在水中浮沉，一個要冒出水而，衝着另外一個，禁不住一個浪頭的打擊，或者互相一擠，又都沉了下去，沉下去的，仍然再想冒出水面，嘴裏在不停的喊着，嚷着，可是漸漸力竭聲嘶，有些聽不淸楚了。那聲音也變成了——</p>
<p>「救救被淹沒的人吧！」</p>
<p>炊烟早巳不知在什麼時候熄滅，鳥鴉也沒有了影子，暮色可見深沉，薄暮中血污池邊正站着許多手執三　馬叉的牛頭馬面，端正着鋒利的馬叉，對準着那些沉溺的弱者，掙扎冒出水面的，還有在吶喊呼救的，就這麼一叉一叉戳過去，戳入永底，隨着拔出的叉尖，湧出一股又一股的鮮血，鮮血浮上水面冒着熱汽，屍身就此默默的沉沒了，安靜的再不冒上來。</p>
<p>接着是鬼卒得意的看着熱血染紅了的江水，獰惡的大聲的狂笑。殘酷的笑聲在濃重的空氣中蕩漾開去，震撼着許多華麗的玻窗格格作響。窗內正安坐着掙大近視的，色盲的，甚至失明的眼睛的紳士和淑女，在欣賞着江上夕陽，這時也不免受了一點震驚，心裏盪了一下，却立刻互相用一種鎭定的機笑掩蓋了。</p>
<p>可是，江邊的獰笑獰還未停　，江上的蘿葡，卻變成整船整船的翻下去。在水中浮沉的男女，擁得更緊，擠得更兇，也傾軋得更厲害；馬又如于點似的戳去，熟血像蓮蓬頭似的噴出。</p>
<p>這是耶蘇也無法拯救的靈魂的沉淪，釋迦也不能超度的生命的毀滅。偶然有一位兩位熱心的人，皺緊一付苦臉，控着一颗沉鬰的心，吐出先知的聲音，講術上古時代雪裏送炭的荒唐故事；可是誰也不聽，誰也不懂。禁不住滾滾的浪潮，一會兒他也被捲入汹涌的波濤，聽任着後浪追逐前浪，大浪壓蓋小浪，終於沒入水底，沉向更深的深淵。就連那自以為欣賞別人沉溺的紳士淑女，轉眼也會像蘿葡也似的翻落江心；吃人的結果還是被吃。沒有例外。</p>
<p>於是——</p>
<p>心裏的畫境，一眨眼，變成了夜色溟濛，大地是死樣的沉寂，天上有家洛的疏星，隔江有幾點漁火；大槪是遠方來此的漁人正撒下破爛的漁網，想網取歷史的沉渣。一聲嘹亮，凄淸而悠長，有隻弔古的孤鴻掠空而過。鴻影消逝，漁人入夢了。</p>
<h3>最近的世界文壇</h3>
<p>— 趙景深</p>
<p>西班牙詩人羅迦</p>
<p>西班牙羅迦（Federico　Garcia　Lorca）最近所寫的三種悲劇已有英譯出版，還是文壇上的一件大事。其中最好的一種「陳爾巴的家」（The　House　of　Bemada　Alba）除英譯外，還不曾有過別種譯本。三個劇本都譯得很好，可說是權威的譯本，譯者是阿康耐爾（O’Connell）和盧仁（Gragam—Lujan），一切羅迦的作品都是他們倆譯的。這些悲劇是從對話的散文到緊張的抒情。「耶爾瑪」（Yerma）是　譯的改訂，「而族婚姻」（BloodWedding）則是新譯。詩人的哥哥弗南西斯柯（Francisco）寫了一篇序，這篇序寫得雅俗共賞，無論是學者或一般讀者，看起來都一樣感到興趣。</p>
<p>按着次序，血族結婚，耶爾瑪和阿爾巴的家是羅迦最近三年的作品，所以這可以代表他的藝術中心傾向最高的發展，也就是他哥哥所謂：「重新抓住傳統，用現代的成語表現出來。前兩個劇本在西班牙舞台演出之後，頓時被稱爲傑作，覺得他的著作像維加（Lope　de　Vega）和卡爾德隆（Calderon）的作品，不僅現代作家的作品。他　他的先輩一樣，是把詩歌放到嚴肅的舞台上去的。他看重詩意甚過寫實。血族婚姻差不多完全是抒情的對白，但這比散文却更動人，更有戲劇效果。阿爾巴的家利用象徵和劇中人緊張的成情，尤見成功。此劇單純，經濟，結構亦極完整。</p>
<p>這三種英雄悲劇完全是西班牙的，帶着濃厚的地方色彩。</p>
<p>還有一本一「羅迦詩選」，譯者是史本道（Stephen　Spender）和吉利（J．L．Gili）。原刋於一九三九，現在選了一次再出版。這可以說是羅迦的代表作，可信以前那代爾（R．M．Nadal）的序文現巳删去，西班牙原文亦已省略，大約是爲了售價低廉原故。不過換了一部分新譯，却是可喜的事情。其中收有「惠特曼頌」（Ode　to　Walt　Whitman）和「麥傑柯斯哀歌」（Lament　for　Jgnacio　SanchezMejias）的全譯，後者恐怕是羅迦最偉大的抒情詩。這個新版本還改正了一部分誤譯，並且修正得更加忠實，務期能得到原詩的　律。這些改訂都是很成功的。</p>

<h3>Legislative Yuan Session Extended Again: Budget to be Reviewed in Secret, Executive Yuan Plans New Measures to Stabilize Prices</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch of the 29th] The first session of the First Legislative Yuan, by decision of the Yuan meeting on the 29th, has been extended again until July 20th, with the recess beginning on the 21st. During this period, the Yuan will concentrate all its efforts on handling the national general budget for the second half of the 37th year and other important bills urgently requiring resolution.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch of the 29th] The Legislative Yuan will hold a closed meeting on July 2nd to discuss the national general budget for the second half of the 37th year in installments. At that time, the Premier of the Executive Yuan, the Comptroller-General, and the Minister of Finance will all attend as required by Article 33 of the Budget Law to provide explanations. The national general budget was originally scheduled to be delivered to the Legislative Yuan on the 28th, but due to time constraints in printing and proofreading, it could not be issued as scheduled. Comptroller-General Xu Kan visited Zhang Zhaoyuan, Secretary-General of the Legislative Yuan, on the afternoon of the 28th to explain the reason, stating that it would be submitted as soon as possible on the 29th. However, during the Legislative Yuan meeting on the afternoon of the 29th, Secretary-General Zhang received telephone calls from Li Weiguo, Secretary-General of the Executive Yuan, and Xu Kan, stating that the printing and proofreading of the general budget would take time and likely not be submitted to the Legislative Yuan until the morning of July 2nd.

<h3>Premier Weng Visits the President: Presents Newly Drafted Measures to Stabilize Prices, Focusing on Controlling Financial Markets</h3>

<h3>Liu Wendao Explains Reasons for Retaining Anti-American and Pro-Japanese Case: The United States Did Not Propose the DeLay Plan</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch of the 29th] At the Legislative Yuan meeting on the 29th, the review opinions of the Foreign Affairs Committee were accepted without objection, and it was resolved to "Temporarily Retain" the temporary motion on "Anti-American and Pro-Japanese" sentiments previously proposed by Li Yunliang. According to Liu Wendao, convener of the Foreign Affairs Committee, the reasons for the review were explained. Regarding the point in Li's original case about being alert to the serious crisis that the American DeLay Plan might cause, it was believed that (1) the legal basis of the Bao Lai Plan, passed by the Eleven Far Eastern Commission in September 1945, had never been shaken. (2) The Striker Plan and the DeLay Plan are still only plans, and the United States has not indicated that it will adopt them as national policies and submit them to the Far Eastern Commission. (3) We retain the veto power in the Far Eastern Commission, and we can insist on opposing and vetoing any opinions that are unfavorable to our country. The Legislative Yuan can certainly resolve to supervise and support the government, but there is absolutely no need for aimless emergency measures at present. As for preventing the resurgence of Japanese military and economic power, it is believed that (1) trade with Japan is unilateral, and Japanese ships are not allowed to carry goods to our country's ports. (2) Our country has never designated a protected fishing zone, and Japanese fishing boats fishing outside our territorial waters, those sunk or arrested, are still being dealt with. In short, we will never allow them to infringe upon our fishing rights. (3) We have obtained the most from the Japanese compensation amount, and it is not good to demand too much. (4) What facts there are about American support for Japan still need to be fully studied before they can be determined. Therefore, the Foreign Affairs Committee decided to temporarily retain Li's case. Liu also said: Although Li's case has attracted domestic and foreign attention, recognizing American support for Japan and adding opposition, public opinion can express opinions, students can take action, but the Legislative Yuan must carefully judge and make a decision on this.</p>
<h3>Supervisory Yuan Passes Resolution to Appoint Members to Investigate the Truth About Prices: And Requests the Executive Yuan Again to Take Effective Measures</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch of the 29th] The Supervisory Yuan held its 13th meeting at 9:30 a.m. on the 29th, chaired by Yu Youren. After the Secretariat read the minutes of the 12th meeting, Wang Guanwu first reported on the results of reviewing the Executive Yuan's reply to the corrective case on price stabilization (recorded in this newspaper on the 29th). Then, the members expressed their opinions separately. Some advocated immediately sending members to investigate the truth, and some advocated immediately forming a financial and economic committee to thoroughly study the matter. Then Mao Yiheng advocated that the objects of investigation in the review opinions should be Ping, Tianjin, and Shanghai, and that Guangzhou should be added to the city because Guangzhou is the base camp of South China. At the same time, national banks and production loans should also be investigated and opposed, because in general, they are "production loans in name, loans to wealthy families in reality." Chen Zhiming said that those who implement policies are those who manipulate policies. Combining the speeches of various members, there were no major discrepancies in the review opinions. Finally, Chen Darong made a suggestion, saying, (1) the Executive Yuan should be requested to take effective measures again, (2) the Yuan should continue to conduct a thorough investigation of the truth and submit it to the general assembly for review. Regarding the investigators, it is not necessary for the members to elect them, the President can appoint them, and they must keep it secret. After voting, Chen Darong's opinion was passed. Then, Tian Jiongjin reported on the experience of attending the Legislative Yuan Review Committee on the 28th, and reported that the Supervisory Law sent by the Supervisory Yuan to the Legislative Yuan had been submitted in the Legislative Yuan Review Committee, but because there was no legal basis for the Supervisory Yuan to submit legal cases to the Legislative Yuan, the review could not proceed. A compromise was then adopted, and it was submitted to the Legislative Yuan by Legislative Yuan members signing. Finally, the draft organizational regulations of the Supervisory Committee's Administrative Office were submitted for discussion. There was much discussion and disagreement about the term of office, native place, and number of members of the Administrative Office. Finally, some people believed that the draft had been discussed for several days without results and should be submitted to a vote immediately. After the chairman summarized several opinions and voted on them separately, the final decision was that there would be three members of the Administrative Office, and whether to avoid the native place of the members would not be a rigid requirement. Their term of office is one year and cannot be re-elected. The meeting adjourned at 12:30.</p>
<h3>Organizational Regulations of the Administrative Office: Supervisory Yuan Amends and Passes</h3>
<p>It is Difficult to Establish the Administrative Office at the Same Time Due to Financial Difficulties</p>

Chairman Yu Youren continued to discuss from Article 4 of the original draft discussed in the morning. Many members put forward amendments, which were all submitted to a vote but failed to pass. After the break, Li Xuhuan proposed that Article 4 be deleted and stipulated in the detailed rules of procedure, which was approved by 51 out of 91 people present. Yang Shangdong proposed in Article 5 that a second item be added: "The chairman of the Administrative Office Committee meeting shall be held by the members in turn," which was also approved. There were not many amendments to Article 6 and below. Zhao Guangchen only proposed that Articles 11, 12, and 13 be merged into Article 10, and Article 14 be moved to the second item of Article 10, which was approved. Articles 15 and 16 had slight textual amendments. The entire draft was then completely amended and passed.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 29th] At the 13th meeting of the Supervisory Yuan on the afternoon of the 29th, President Yu Youren sincerely explained that the country's current financial difficulties make it difficult to appoint the staff that should be allocated to the Supervisory Yuan's various committees and administrative offices at one time, and that the administrative offices may not be established at the same time, and several regions must be selected first for establishment based on factual needs.</p>

<h3>Editorial: Freedom from Fear in Academia</h3>
<p>—Another Word for Professors and Students of Chen Xue University—</p>
<p>In August 1941, the late U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt and former British Prime Minister Winston Churchill issued a joint declaration, first mentioning the need to strive for all mankind to enjoy "freedom from want and freedom from fear." The United Nations Declaration of January of the following year also accepted this principle. Roosevelt continued to emphasize in later broadcasts on the ideals of the post-war world "freedom of speech, freedom of worship, freedom from want, and freedom from fear." Freedom of speech and belief is an old tradition of democratic ideals, "freedom from want" became more important after the climax of the Industrial Revolution and capitalism, and "freedom from fear" can be said to be the spiritual freedom that people increasingly feel the urgent need for in the growth of modern totalitarianism and new aggression.</p>
<p>In today's world and today's China, we are particularly fearful of whether a third world war that will destroy peace will come early, and we are already suffering from the military threat and fear of the communist bandits' rebellion. Within the walls of universities and colleges that study advanced academics, honest professors and studious students are particularly subject to a special kind of terrible spiritual threat: what they feel more deeply painful than the difficulties of life is the spiritual loss of "freedom from fear"! In the rapid series of activities and tense atmosphere of some students staging "wall posters," "meetings," "elections," "strikes," and "parades," they have lost the freedom to teach and the freedom to learn; in the suffocating atmosphere of not daring to express their opinions directly, they still have to immerse themselves in worries about "not being able to attend classes" and the terror of accumulating a bad reputation or disaster because of dissent!</p>
<p>Roosevelt's tomb is covered with grass, but his last words are still in our ears. The blood of our soldiers and civilians in the War of Resistance has dried, but justice has not been extinguished. University teachers and students who admire the truth, reminiscing about the shout of freedom that was advocated seven years ago, and recalling the past scene of stability and progress in our schools ten years ago, should not be overwhelmed by the feeling of human affairs vicissitudes and the fear of cultural and educational shrinkage!</p>
<p>We do not often comment on the student unrest that has been fluctuating for the past six months, and when we do, we only criticize the misguided and harmful behavior of strikes, and call on professors not to sit idly by, and hope that teachers and students can use reason to express the opinions of the majority, in order to regain social sympathy. Now we would like to point out how the majority of university teachers and students are trapped in confusion and fear based on the situation of several universities in the past month, for the discussion and reflection of our professors and students who are loyal to their work.</p>
<p>In the midst of the confrontation between the two major international blocs, and the increasingly fierce Cold War, all mankind is suffering from the threat of war. However, although people cannot enjoy the freedom of being completely free from the fear of war, all countries, from top to bottom, must be able to use their wisdom to postpone the disaster of war because the wounds have not yet recovered. In China, the more direct fear comes from the persecution of the Communist Party. In addition to the accumulated actions of the bandit army, this persecution is taking different forms, infiltrating various departments like bacteria, so we have witnessed Chinese higher education being trapped in turbulence, unease, and the un-freedom of fear, which has become increasingly intense in the past year and a half.</p>
<p>The university is a cultural center for free research and free lectures, "reason should reign over everything" (quoting Plato). This is the tradition of Western universities, and also the spirit of Confucianism in establishing education. In academia, scholars may not all be able to obtain "freedom from want" (the ancients had the saying "worry about the way, not worry about poverty", and even modern scientists devote themselves to the study of "utilizing and enriching life", not for their own food and clothing), but they must be able to strive for "freedom from fear." For the sake of this freedom, countless men of virtue have sacrificed their lives: from Socrates' execution, Bruno's persecution, and the martyrdom of many scholars in China's party disasters and changes of dynasties, all are examples. The May Fourth Movement freed us from the remaining shackles of the old era. Respecting reason and trusting in freedom are the true traditions of the May Fourth Movement, and of course, we must also reject "dogma" and the fear that persecutes people's freedom of will. Everyone has freedom, without infringing on the freedom of others, this is the basic meaning of democracy! Fully develop reason, without using any fear of violence, this is the true spirit of the university!</p>
<p>But what has become of the universities and colleges in China in the past year! We cannot bear to look back on the past, we only need to close our eyes and think about the student unrest that has been constantly staged in the past month, using strikes and other means of coercion. We can’t enumerate all of them - such as the fights and boycotts caused by exhibitions at Shanghai Law School and St. John's University, the beating of the Youth Corps by some students of the three universities in Nanjing, such as Zhejiang University’s pursuit of the president to withdraw the order to expel students, Jiangxi Zhongzheng University’s asking for public funds, South Teachers College’s rejection of the president, Zhejiang Yingda’s smashing of Jinzhong, and even the recent sudden request for nationalization of Shanghai Guanghua University and Daxia University on the eve of the final exam, ... almost making society suspect that the university is not a place to study academics, but just an old center for seeking materials to oppose the government, making the country's education and culture constantly regress. Taking Jiaotong University as an example, Jiaotong University has been too unstable, too little progress, and too lost social inquiry and credibility in the past year. Fortunately, the June 5th parade did not expand. The municipal authorities sternly questioned President Cheng Xiaogang. The students who manipulated the student union skillfully coerced President Cheng, causing President Cheng to resign in this situation of losing "freedom of will." Before leaving, he also gave the students an earnest warning. The newspapers in the capital have criticized him too severely, or said that he protected the vocational students who answered the country's questions, or said that his method of "guiding with virtue" had failed completely, and even criticized his words as "close to the tone of the concession authorities." But when we think about President Cheng's situation and trace his intentions, we simply feel a little unbearable to deeply blame this president who has the intention to do good, but cannot firmly run the school in this environment. His mood and actions are almost involuntary in the loss of "freedom from fear". The so-called "student union not only leads autonomy from Song, but also first destroys and obstructs the school's maintenance of order", the so-called intention to dissolve the student union but finally failed, wanting to vomit but holding it back, the head of a school is like this, the atmosphere in the school is even more imaginable how it suppresses the majority of pure professors and scattered and docile students.</p>
<p>An unbiased observation can also make it clear that a small number of vocational students with special backgrounds who are good at controlling and manipulating have entered the famous universities in the country, creating an atmosphere of fear and threat, and playing a role in destroying order and harming the country. Some of these vocational students return from studying abroad and still go to university to enter the second or third grade, and some graduate from university and still go back to middle school to attend classes. If there is no other intention, why do they do this? The ways they create fear are: first, using false democracy, leading elections, so-called public opinion surveys, using the lack of organization and indifferent onlookers of the majority to carry out their core operations and achieve their goals of manipulating groups. The second is violence, which is used when necessary to coerce a part of the students who dare to speak and dare to dissent. The third is the abuse and satire in propaganda techniques. For professors who are relatively close to the government, no matter how high their academic reputation is, they will use all methods to denigrate them, preferably making them retreat in the face of difficulties, or at least not allowing them to have a position to speak in the school; for students who are strong and have a sense of justice, they will try to dissuade them from being the target of public criticism and dare not do good; for those who love vanity and fear bad names, they will either wrap them in the beautiful name of freedom and democracy, or spend them with the exposure of the country's special reaction; to further sneak in and include new members and give them special training, they will coordinate the methods of street racing. In addition, they will also use the unrest in current affairs and the economy to find every problem to emphasize the government's incompetence and fully alienate the centripetal force of the middle class towards the country. In today's distorted changes in national affairs and the economy, the intellectual cultivation of professors and scholars is not easy to be very strong, and students' intellectual training is even more insufficient, so teachers who cherish themselves fear the bad name of "stubborn and corrupt elements"; students who are generally unclear about reason and are timid because of no organization are even more threatened by the double threat of vicious comments and violence. If we want to understand how a small number of vocational students can exert great power in schools and make every student unrest seem to be a unified demand, its main operation is probably like this.</p>
<p>We never want to dogmatically say that all student unrest is directed by communist vocational students and ignore the internal unhealthy factors of the school, nor can we ignore the general political and economic unrest and contradictions of today. However, we must point out that the atmosphere in most schools today has such a strange and bizarre threat, making most students dare to be angry but dare not speak out, making some students be deceived and instigated and unconsciously shout with them, making some teaching assistants and lecturers also use core operation methods as their periphery, making most professors have some powers of precept and remain silent, or speak out in anger but also have no effect, and finally making the president fall into isolation, and even being intimidated by their unreasonable demands. The school cannot be stable, the interruption of studies is intermittent, the level is getting worse, the academics are regressing, and the largest expenditure of the national cultural and educational budget is almost completely equal to a waste!</p>
<p>To break this atmosphere of fear, restore the dignity of the majority of professors in lecturing, and protect the rights of the vast majority of students to study and the progress of national academic education, we believe that professors with intellectual cultivation and the majority of students who love themselves and love the country must stand up firmly, discuss together, and exert the organized moral force, which is by no means something that the educational administration or local political and police authorities can solve on their behalf. Only by breaking the terror threat in schools and restoring "freedom from fear" in universities can we realize the mission of higher education in our nation's suppression of chaos and nation-building.</p>

<h3>Forceful Japanese Rectification Work</h3>
<p>— Wu Jiatang</p>
<p>No matter how ambitious a Japanese person is today, whether they have a future depends on their wartime conduct and whether the Allied Supreme Commander can trust them. This is because the rectification work in Japan is being carried out with considerable seriousness. In my previous article, I mentioned the third invisible atomic bomb that is changing Japan's political, social, and economic structure, and the main power of this slow-motion explosion comes from this rectification work.</p>
<p>When Allied Supreme Commander officials talk about the rectification work to outsiders, they emphasize that this work is not punitive but preventive. I am ashamed of my lack of research into these theoretical issues, but it is clear from the implementation process of the rectification work that there is a lack of retaliatory behavior. In Japan, the word "rectification" is indeed different from the collective purges and brutal killings in some countries. Therefore, some people who advocate revenge accuse the Allied Supreme Commander's policies of being too lenient. These people who like bloodshed believe that to rectify, the purged elements should simply be lined up and shot. They do not believe that there are other ways to eliminate political enemies besides bloodshed. However, the Allied Supreme Commander in Japan did not take this path. The bloodless methods they use may take more time, but they can achieve the expected results. At the same time, this kind of orderly plan can prevent a political disturbance, otherwise, if chaos occurs, it will only benefit the Japanese Communist Party.</p>
<p>The historical basis of the Japanese rectification work can be traced back to the Potsdam Declaration and the instructions of the Joint Chiefs of Staff to the Allied Supreme Commander. The latter instructed the Allied Supreme Commander to remove "all past militarists and aggressors, or powerful members of patriotic terrorist groups, so that they can no longer hold public office or important positions in enterprises." In addition, those who were active in the Imperial Rule Assistance Association or who showed hostility to the goals of the Allied occupation must be subject to the same restrictions. Based on this instruction, the Allied Supreme Commander issued the famous January 4th Directive on January 4, 1946, ordering the Japanese government to remove militarists and aggressors from government agencies, including the following categories: (1) war criminals, (2) professional army and navy personnel, special higher police and army department officials, including army and navy generals, military councilors of the Grand Marshal's Office, Privy Council, senior personnel of the army and navy departments, and all officers and soldiers who participated in army, navy, police, or intelligence work, (3) powerful members of secret patriotic terrorist groups, (4) powerful figures of the Imperial Rule Assistance Association, and the Asia Patriotic Association and its affiliates, (5) officials of national policy companies related to Japan's external strategy, including the directors, presidents, vice presidents, advisors, and managers of branch offices in occupied areas from the "July 7th Incident" to September 2, 1945, (6) governors of occupied areas, including all civil and military officials of Japan's wartime colonial empire, (7) all military remnants and extreme nationalists. Once the directive was issued, the Japanese government established an agency on February 27, 1946, to implement the instruction. The Japanese government also issued orders specifying who could be used and who should be rejected, and finally explained how the screening work should be completed.</p>
<p>Under this law, all middle and lower-level officials, as well as companies and groups under government control, and all personnel preparing to participate in elections and public agencies, underwent screening procedures to determine their eligibility. At the same time, based on the broad provisions of the seventh category, the Japanese government announced a list of all the highest-ranking officials in Japan who had decision-making power during the period from the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War to the Japanese surrender, attached with high-ranking officials of secondary status, and prepared to purge a group of officials whose crimes were obvious, including the following categories: (1) signing treaties with Axis countries or puppet countries to prepare for the so-called "Greater East Asia War," (2) suppressing anti-militarists, (3) concluding economic agreements with occupied countries, (4) planning financial and production plans for Japanese military activities. As a result, 183,000 professional army and navy officers and personnel of the Imperial Rule Assistance Association and its secret patriotic groups were permanently disqualified from holding office. At the same time, due to the Japanese government's interpretation of the Allied Supreme Commander's directive, members of the House of Representatives who had been recommended by the Tojo government to participate in past elections were not allowed to participate in public affairs.</p>
<p>As the initial rectification work rapidly developed, the Allied Supreme Commander issued another statement in August 1946, expanding the scope of the purge from the top to the bottom, extending to the fields of journalism, art, and science. At the same time, the Allied Supreme Commander stipulated that those who were not included in the first directive were also not allowed to participate in the upper and lower houses of the National Diet and local assemblies, and those who were rectified were no longer allowed to work in political and economic organizations.</p>
<p>According to the Allied Supreme Commander's proclamation, the Japanese government allocated a new standard for screening and dismissal, with broad content, including all positions in the central and local governments, staff in many companies, and editors-in-chief, chief writers, and reporters of newspapers and magazines. This law punished the following types of people: (1) instigating war, (2) suppressing anti-war elements, (3) advocating dictatorial systems, (4) controlling speech, (5) implementing political manipulation and economic exploitation in occupied areas, (6) promoting important plans for wartime mobilization. This law involved a large number of writers and artists who advocated for aggressive ideology. Those who were purged were those who established theoretical and ideological foundations for policies such as "Greater East Asiaism" and the "New Order in East Asia" through their political or philosophical theories. In addition, powerful national policy companies and their large companies were also rectified from top to bottom. At the same time, another intention of this law was to allow more new people to appear on the government stage, so it was stipulated that mayors, deputy mayors, and district chiefs who held office from September 1, 1945, to September 1, 1946, could not participate in any elections within the next four years. As the rectification work gradually progressed, the issue began to touch on so-called "invisible war criminals," referring to Japanese who participated in political activities but did not fall into the above categories. This group was also individually nominated by the Japanese government and gradually rectified. Due to the wide scope of the rectification, some people said that the elements who were excluded from the government had turned to underground activities. When I was in Tokyo, I tried to study whether there was a powerful underground government in existence. I sought information from various sources, including several well-informed and reliable journalists, but none of them could tell me for sure that there was such a planned and organized underground organization in Japan at present. Based on the evidence collected by the author, it is impossible to prove that there is a so-called underground movement. If there is one, it probably refers to the secret activities led by the Japanese Communist Party.</p>

<h3>Four Leaders of Yugoslavia Fall Out with the Soviet Union Internal Split Revealed Behind the Iron Curtain Marshal Tito May Be Under Surveillance Yugoslav Government to Issue Statement Responding to Comintern Condemnation</h3>
<p>[Our dispatch] London, 29th – The official Yugoslav news agency reports that the Yugoslav government's statement regarding the Comintern Information Bureau is expected to be released around 6 PM today.</p>
<p>[United Press London, 29th] The Italian radio station's report that Yugoslavia has declared martial law nationwide has been denied by Belgrade. Meanwhile, American diplomatic sources say the Soviet Union may create a pretext to send troops into Yugoslavia.</p>
<p>[Reuters Washington, 28th] Diplomats with extensive experience believe that the Comintern's public condemnation of Marshal Tito indicates that Tito has been "placed under surveillance" and is no longer the active leader of Belgrade. Two points can be determined: (1) the communist leadership will now have to deal with the first major split in the Eastern European bloc; (2) the communist leadership must have taken action before publicly condemning, as communist parties inside and outside the Soviet Union have invariably taken this approach when implementing purges for many years.</p>
<p>[Reuters London, 28th] Moscow's declaration through the Comintern Information Bureau is actually a call for the Yugoslav people to revolt against their government and leaders. The Comintern's call for loyal members of the Yugoslav Communist Party to replace their leaders is effectively ordering them to take direct action against the government. The four Yugoslav communist leaders most severely condemned by the Comintern Information Bureau – Marshal Tito, Rankovic, Djilas, and Kardelj – are the figures who control Yugoslavia today. Tito, as a hero of the resistance war and Prime Minister and Minister of Defense, will certainly gain the loyalty of most of the Yugoslav standing army. Rankovic, as Minister of the Interior, controls the national police, including the highly effective political police. Kardelj, regarded as Tito's brain during the resistance war, is the soul of the Yugoslav Communist Party, and is the main guide of Yugoslav foreign policy. Foreign Minister Simic, who participated in the Warsaw Conference last week, is merely a figurehead. As for Minister without Portfolio Djilas, he is an explosive and powerful figure in the Tito system, and also a hero of the resistance war, with close ties to the army. Therefore, the condemned Yugoslav communist leaders are actually the nerve center of Yugoslavia. Without direct intervention from external powers, it is not known how the so-called loyal comrades of the Yugoslav Communist Party can replace these four leaders. Relevant sources also believe that Marshal Tito, as a hero of the resistance war, leads post-war Yugoslavia, so non-communist elements in the country also have a good impression of him. The Comintern's condemnation of Tito is tantamount to regarding Tito as a defender of Yugoslav independence against Moscow's interference, which will inevitably increase the Yugoslav people's goodwill towards Tito.</p>
<h3>Different Perceptions in Various Countries Regarding the Yugoslav Incident Believed to Accelerate the Completion of the Austrian Peace Treaty and Early Resolution of the Trieste Issue</h3>
<p>[Reuters London, 29th] It is reported that the Yugoslav government will issue a statement on the 30th, responding to the Comintern Information Bureau's accusations against the Yugoslav Communist Party and its leaders. Communist members of parliament in Paris are keeping silent, but right-wing elements believe that the expulsion of the Yugoslav Communist Party leaders from the Comintern Information Bureau is a reassuring phenomenon for Western countries and a lesson that Eastern European countries should be wary of. People in Rome are very excited about this news, and expect Yugoslavia to become closer to Italy and resolve all outstanding issues between the two countries.</p>
<p>People in London also believe that Tito's break with Moscow may lead to a resolution of the Trieste issue, accelerate the completion of the Austrian peace treaty, reduce communist oppression of Greece, and that the split behind the Iron Curtain will prevent the Soviet Union from going to war with Western countries over the Berlin crisis.</p>
<p>[United Press Lake Success, 29th] United Nations officials are taking a wait-and-see attitude towards the Tito incident, believing that more information is needed to understand the full picture. However, many people share the attitude of officials in Washington and London, believing that the Soviet Union must have been confident of controlling Yugoslavia before announcing the split.</p>
<h3>Views of Our Political Figures</h3>
<p>[United Press Nanjing, 29th] Senior political circles expressed excitement over Yugoslavia's exclusion from the Soviet Union's satellite sphere, considering it a major victory for Western countries, but some observers warned against excessive optimism. Some predict that the Soviet Union will intensify its suppression of other satellite countries, and may simultaneously re-apply large-scale pressure on East Asia. Others said that this may be an "apparently important but actually worthless discovery," and that "any gift from the Communist Party must be carefully considered for its goodness." He also said, "This news is too good to be true."</p>
<p>However, the unanimous opinion is that the Soviet Union has lost its main European stronghold, thus greatly reducing Stalin's strength. Some even said that the main bases of the Soviet Union's cold war strategy in the future will be Trieste, Greece, and Italy. Another senior Kuomintang official said that the Soviet Union's expansionism has clashed with the nationalism of its satellite countries, and that the differences between them are irreconcilable. The Balkan countries are mainly agricultural countries, and they really hope to cooperate with the industrial countries of Western Europe, even though they and the Soviet Union belong to the same Slavic nation. The Marshall Plan has given the Soviet Union's satellite countries great enticement and is becoming unstable. The same events may become clear with the passage of time, but the Soviet Union will undoubtedly "nail rivets on its Iron Curtain."</p>
<h3>US Ambassador to Yugoslavia Returns Home for Consultation</h3>
<p>[United Press Lisbon, 28th] The US Ambassador to Yugoslavia, Cannon, arrived in Lisbon on the 28th and will return to the United States from here to report on the Danube River Conference and the internal situation in Yugoslavia.</p>
<p>[French News Agency Washington, 28th] The authorities do not want to rush to criticize the Comintern Information Bureau's resolution condemning the Yugoslav Communist Party until they receive information from the US representatives in Eastern Europe.</p>
<h3>The Situation in Berlin Is Gradually Improving The Soviet Union Has Lifted the Blockade of East-West Transportation Air Transport Continues, and There Is No Shortage of Food in the Western Sectors</h3>
<p>[United Press Berlin, 29th] The Soviet military authorities announced this morning that the blockade of transportation between the eastern and western parts of Germany has been lifted, but the railway blockade of the western sectors of Berlin will not be lifted for some time. The reason is that the Herstel-Berlin line is still under repair and will take some time to complete.</p>
<p>[Reuters Berlin, 29th] The Western powers are transporting food to Berlin by air and waterway, which is expected to invalidate the Soviet Union's blockade of the western sectors of Berlin.

<h3>Comintern Information Bureau Declaration Severely Condemns Yugoslav Leaders Accuses Policies of Violating Leninism and Marxism</h3>
<p>[Reuters Prague, 28th] The communist newspaper "People's Rights" recently published the Comintern Information Bureau's communiqué after its recent meeting in Romania, which is virtually equivalent to expelling Yugoslav Prime Minister Marshal Tito from the party and calling on loyal comrades of the Yugoslav Communist Party to replace their leaders. The communiqué accuses the Yugoslav Communist Party, led by Tito, of tacitly acknowledging the threat of capitalist countries to Yugoslav independence under Soviet policy, engaging in anti-Soviet propaganda, adopting a dangerous attitude toward the Soviet Union and the Soviet Communist Party, and distrusting Soviet experts in Yugoslavia, even monitoring their actions with security police. Therefore, the Comintern Information Bureau confirms that the Yugoslav Communist Party has adopted erroneous policies that deviate from Marxism and Leninism, deviate from unified socialist policies, and move toward betraying the international solidarity of the working class. It acknowledges that the Soviet Communist Party Central Committee's exposure of the erroneous policies of the Yugoslav Communist Party Central Committee, especially the two leaders Tito and Kardelj, is indeed true. The communiqué said that the Yugoslav communist leaders have begun to adopt an attitude that regards the Soviet Union as a persecutor, repeatedly slandering the Soviet Communist Party and Soviet leaders. Their anti-Soviet attitude is unprecedented, and the leadership of Eastern European countries has already felt threatened. Internal divisions have already occurred within the Yugoslav Communist Party, but domestic and foreign people have repeatedly criticized the Yugoslav Communist Party, and the Yugoslav Communist Party has retaliated against critics with the most brutal measures. The simplest rights of party members have been denied, and expulsions and arrests have occurred repeatedly. In addition, unreasonable laws have been promulgated to nationalize small shops and organize self-cultivating farmers rashly. These measures, without preparation, are implemented rashly by administrative orders, which will inevitably cause serious consequences. The Bureau confirms that the anti-party and anti-Soviet opinions and actions of the Yugoslav communist leaders, and their refusal to attend this meeting of the Bureau, have deviated from the unified anti-imperialist socialist front and moved toward betraying the international solidarity of the working class. The Bureau hereby solemnly announces that the Yugoslav Communist Party Central Committee has therefore separated itself and the Yugoslav Communist Party from the Communist Party family and withdrawn from the Communist Unified Front and the Comintern Information Bureau. The Bureau believes that this is due to the fact that the hidden nationalists within the Yugoslav Communist Party in the past five or six months have openly interfered in the leadership of the Yugoslav Communist Party. The Yugoslav communist leaders have overestimated their country's strength, mistakenly believing that they can establish their socialism without the support of the Soviet Union and other communist parties. They are intimidated by imperialists, believing that they can lean toward capitalism and win the favor of imperialists, and reach an agreement on Yugoslav independence. They tacitly accept bourgeois nationalism, believing that the threat of capitalist countries to Yugoslav independence is still below that of the Soviet Union. The Bureau believes that there must be a considerable number of believers in Yugoslavia who are loyal to Marxism and Leninism and can force their leaders to correct their policies and return to the path of internationalism. Otherwise, these leaders must be replaced, and it is believed that the Communist Party will be able to fulfill this glorious task.</p>

<h3>Melting and Selling Gold Bars, Manipulating the Black Market: Authorities Crack Down on Major Organization; Mastermind Released on Bail the Same Night After Arrest</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Yesterday, this city cracked down on a shocking black market gold and currency operation. The mastermind behind this operation not only had the power to manipulate the city's entire black market for gold and currency, but also brazenly claimed to have close relationships with several high-ranking officials. The organization was equipped with its own furnace, masquerading as several major gold firms by counterfeiting their marks and secretly adding impurities to produce "pure gold" that was not of sufficient purity. Over the past three months, countless people have fallen victim. Recently, the city's highest public security authority learned of the above situation and, in a swift and decisive action yesterday, joined forces with relevant authorities to investigate and crack down on the operation. The organization was located at 331 Jiangxi Road Central, originally the Jitai Silver Firm, now renamed the Jitai Yarn Firm, and the mastermind was Hu Xinyi. It is reported that after the authorities announced the strengthening of the crackdown on black market gold and currency transactions, Hu immediately went into action, establishing a relationship with personnel from a certain organization. He then used this relationship to flaunt his influence and, in the furnace on the third floor of the firm, secretly added impurities to gold bars collected from the black market to reduce their purity. He then re-melted them into bars and sold them in a roundabout way. Every day, hundreds of gold bars melted and manufactured by him flowed out through the black market. For every bar sold, he could earn a net profit of one tael of gold from the impurity. By secretly operating in this way, he accumulated countless wealth. However, after being arrested, Hu vehemently denied any criminal activity. After questioning, the investigating authority released him on bail the same night, pending further investigation and verification.</p>
<h3>Military and Police Authorities Take Further Steps to Suppress Prices With All Efforts</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The authorities have formulated more effective measures to deal with the current wave of rising prices. It is reported that: (1) Starting today, the work of each police precinct and the inspection office of the garrison headquarters will shift its focus to concentrate all efforts on suppressing prices. (2) A deadline will be set for the investigation and clear identification of all black market gold and currency traders and hoarding profiteers in each jurisdiction, so that they can be severely punished at any time. (3) Inspections of warehouses will be strengthened. If any suspected hoarding is discovered, its source must be investigated. Once verified, leniency will not be granted.</p>
<p>[Another Report] The Municipal Police Bureau convened an important temporary meeting yesterday morning in the bureau's conference room, attended by heads of police precincts and above, to discuss measures to suppress prices. Songhu Garrison Commander Yi Tiewu also attended and delivered a speech. Commander Xuan first made a profound analysis of the domestic situation, and then pointed out the seriousness of the current price problem. He stated that the solution to this problem is no longer suitable for the general measures of the past, and that from now on, extremely severe measures should be taken to deal with speculative profiteers in order to achieve effective results. Commander Xuan subsequently gave a similar speech at the garrison headquarters to all officers, in order to encourage them.</p>
<h3>Steamships Universally Increase Freight Rates, China Merchants Steam Navigation Company to Implement Tomorrow</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 29th] The National Steamship Joint Association has decided to universally increase passenger and freight rates for Yangtze River and coastal steamships by 80%. Passenger and freight exports from Taiwan, calculated in Taiwan dollars, will not be increased for the time being. For transit goods, the increase from Shanghai to Hankou is 2.5 million per ton, and from Hankou to Yichang, 1.1 million. Bulky goods will be subject to an additional 80%. Various shipping companies have already implemented the new rates today, while China Merchants Steam Navigation Company will adjust them from July 1.</p>
<h3>Oil Supply of China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, Fears Not Resolved</h3>
<p>A person in charge of China Merchants Steam Navigation Company said: After the last suspension of navigation, the company was able to barely maintain operations due to the supply of 5,11 tons from Mobil Oil Company. However, the company's monthly oil consumption is at least around 15,000 tons, and 5,000 tons can only last for about ten days. By the end of this month, the oil reserves will be completely exhausted. Because of the difficulty in purchasing oil domestically, the company recently chartered a ship to purchase and transport 15,000 tons from the Texas Shanta Company in the Persian Gulf. However, based on the estimated voyage, it will not be able to arrive in Shanghai until early August. Therefore, the company has no oil source for the entire month of July.</p>
<h3>18,000 Tons of US Aid Rice, Two Ships to Arrive Early Next Month</h3>

<h3>Soldier's Association Decides to Provide Additional Subsidies for Second Phase of New Soldiers' Family Allowances</h3>
<p>The City Soldiers' Association held its tenth regular meeting yesterday. The association's income has been affected by approximately 400 billion due to changes in the method of paying family allowances for civil servants, teachers, and workers. Recently, new soldiers have requested that in-kind goods be distributed for the second phase of family allowances, which has further strained the supply of family allowances. During yesterday's meeting, it was decided after discussion: (1) An additional subsidy will be provided when issuing the second phase of family allowances. The specific amount will be discussed further. (2) The ninth regular meeting had decided to issue the family allowances for July based on the price of rice in June. After discussion, it was decided to change this and issue them based on the price of rice in July. (3) Only 30% of the family allowances for new soldiers in May and June have been collected so far, which is insufficient for distribution. The matter will be discussed further at the next meeting.</p>
<h3>Municipal Assembly Scheduled to Adjourn Today; Yesterday Passed Resolution Adjusting Municipal Construction Tax Rate on Motor Vehicles; Also Universally Levying Taxes on Non-Motor Vehicles</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The sixth session of the Municipal Assembly held its sixth meeting yesterday. More than one hundred proposals were scheduled for deliberation, but only a small portion of the proposals from the Social Affairs Committee and the Mayor and Speaker were discussed. It was impossible to adjourn as scheduled yesterday. The Assembly passed a motion to extend the meeting by one day. Before adjourning, the Assembly passed a temporary motion by Chen Baotai and 28 others, "Requesting the Municipal Government to strictly prohibit the use of false pretenses, impersonating public opinion, and gathering crowds to petition, in order to quell the source of unrest." The measures are: (1) Each petition group must strictly adhere to the central government's regulations, and the number of representatives sent during the petition must not exceed ten.

<p>(2) In order to cooperate with the needs of price and road engineering, it is proposed to adjust the municipal construction tax rate on motor vehicles and universally levy taxes on non-motor vehicles to benefit municipal construction. Resolution: The adjustment of tax rates was approved, and all motorized and non-motorized vehicles (rickshaws, small carts, and manure carts will be exempted for the time being) will be taxed, starting in July 1948.

<h3>Designating Three Areas as Category C Areas, Factory Location Regulations Revised</h3>
<p>Of the eleven cases submitted by the Speaker, only three were discussed and completed yesterday. Regarding the nine items related to military service raised by the telegram from the Ministry of National Defense, it was decided to combine the proposed answers by the Autonomous Committee with the supplementary opinions of Lu Yinchu and Xie Dahuang to form a reply. Regarding the case proposed by the Public Works Bureau to temporarily designate three areas in Shanghai, namely the Hubai Dachang District, the Huxi Pusong District, and the Hudong Pudong District, as Category C areas before the cremation system becomes widespread, it was resolved to pass the case as is. However, existing Category C buildings that are not within the designated areas should be relocated as much as possible, and no further construction should be allowed. Regarding the regulations on the location of factories in this city, in order to take into account the difficulty of relocating factories that have already been established on a considerable scale in non-factory areas, the regulations are revised as follows: In the "Shanghai Measures for Dealing with Factories Already Established in Non-Factory Areas within the Built-up Area," the following article is added after Article 12: "Category A or Category B factories or workshops already established in non-factory areas, that have obtained construction permits and are still in operation, if their boundaries retain sufficient open space around them (accounting for 30% or more of the total base area) or firewalls to isolate them from neighboring properties, and have been re-examined and approved or ordered to improve in accordance with the provisions of Article 5, may be temporarily allowed to remain and expand appropriately within their original boundaries."</p>
<p>Several Cases Passed by Social Affairs Committee</p>
<p>A total of nineteen proposals were submitted by the Social Affairs Committee. The following is a record of the discussion of important proposals: (1) Three measures for dealing with refugees, vagrants, and street children in this city were resolved to be sent to the Municipal Government for consideration. (2) It was passed to request the Executive Yuan to immediately strengthen the control of daily necessities and implement full rationing in major cities to ensure the livelihood of the people. (3) Five measures to improve the city's food policy ultimately considered that Chairman Ren of the People's Mediation Committee has made the greatest efforts in the city's food administration and should be given sympathy. Therefore, the case was resolved to be re-examined and temporarily suspended from deliberation. (4) The proposal to promote the improvement of social customs was passed. (5) It was passed to request the Municipal Government to take effective measures to suppress prices to ensure the livelihood of the people. (6) It was passed that the Assembly telegraph to the Executive Yuan, ordering the China Trust Bureau to stop bidding for Japanese woolen goods. (7) It was passed to suggest that the central government expedite the handling of relief supplies and not allow them to rot for a long time in order to reduce losses. (8) It was suggested that the government simplify import application procedures to benefit merchants and the people in order to promote exports. (9) It was suggested that the central government reserve half of the special relief donations to prioritize relief for refugees stranded in Shanghai. (10) It was passed that the gold shop industry's price for redeeming gold jewelry should be calculated based on the exchange certificate price in accordance with the telegram from the Executive Yuan.</p>
<p>Restaurants Prohibited from Selling Cold Dishes</p>
<p>In order to prevent the spread of infectious diseases from unfrozen cold foods, the Municipal Health Bureau has also prohibited the sale of cold dishes in various restaurants in the off-season. The bureau now stipulates that restaurants are not allowed to supply cold dishes, and orders the health offices in each district to send personnel to inspect them at any time, and to notify the restaurant industry association to instruct its members to comply.</p>
<h3>China Textile Workers Initiate "Seizing Food Movement," Clearly Being Used by Others; Authorities Strengthen Prevention</h3>
<p>Shanghai News: A portion of workers at the No. 17 China Textile Factory, citing soaring prices and the inability to maintain a living, recently gathered more than ten workers from the factory and initiated a "Seizing Food Movement." On the morning of that day, this group of workers planned to launch their first seizing food movement during lunch. However, because the plan was not kept secret, the factory learned of it and took precautions, resulting in the failure of the movement. At midnight that night, when the staff and machine foremen were eating their midnight meal, the group of workers once again took the opportunity to rush in to seize food. Fortunately, they were prepared, and the attempt was still unsuccessful. However, they seized all of the staff's meat and vegetables. On the 27th, the workers again used the "Seizing Food Movement" as a threat, demanding that the machine foremen make five demands to the factory on their behalf: (1) Each person to borrow 500,000 yuan; (2) To provide each worker with two dou of white rice per month, according to the treatment of private factories; (3) To require the factory to provide a meal at a fixed time; (4) Each person to receive a general wage increase of three jiao; (5) Each person to be issued a set of work clothes. However, when Factory Director Yang convened a meeting of machine foremen and department heads of the factory on the 28th, the machine foremen did not raise the workers' five demands. Seeing that their goal was not achieved, the workers gathered more than a hundred workers when the machine foremen were having dinner at noon on the same day, and prevented the machine foremen from having dinner as a demonstration. They also contacted workers from other factories to expand the movement. Currently, various China Textile factories are brewing similar movements, including the No. 3 China Textile Factory, the No. 4 China Textile Factory, the No. 10 China Textile Factory, the No. 12 China Textile Factory, the No. 14 China Textile Factory, and the No. 19 China Textile Factory. The situation is quite serious. In addition, at 10 am yesterday, more than two hundred workers at the No. 1 Needle and Thread Factory of China Textile in Hudong also attempted to launch the "Seizing Food Movement." The factory learned of this and, fearing that the situation would escalate, telegraphed the Yangshupu Police Bureau to dispatch a large number of police officers to the factory to prevent the incident. No accidents occurred.</p>
<p>Relevant authorities believe that this type of illegal movement affects public safety, and that the initiators of this incident are only a portion of the workers. Therefore, it is clear that some workers are being incited and manipulated by bandits. In addition to paying close attention to prevention to avoid escalating the situation, they have also placed the leaders of the movement under surveillance. Therefore, the situation is expected to be calmed down in the near future.</p>
<h3>Demanding Price Increase, Last Resort; Western Film Distributors Stop Supplying New Films; Cinema Industry to Hold Emergency Meeting Today; May Negotiate to Show Latest Domestic Films to Overcome the "Crisis"</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The nine Western film distributors in the city, dissatisfied with the current low ticket prices of various cinemas and the failure of previous requests for adjustments, have resolutely stopped supplying new films since the day before yesterday. In the past month, the internal problems of the cinema industry have been numerous. Currently, the situation is becoming more complicated due to the cessation of new films by Western film distributors. On the Social Affairs Bureau's side, it is believed that the cinema industry association must be in collusion with the Western film distributors, resulting in repeated unreasonable demands. On the Western film distributors' side, it is consistently believed that the cinema industry association maintains a tacit understanding with the Social Affairs Bureau, so they deliberately create difficulties for their every request. At the same time, the second, third, and fourth-run cinemas are also disgusted with the association, the Social Affairs Bureau, and the first-run cinemas because their opposition to the low price limit for the first run failed. However, the first-run cinemas also have many grievances. They have never wanted to implement price increases based on the standards of Western film distributors to increase their own operating income. However, on the one hand, it is difficult to expect approval from the authorities, and on the other hand, they are also concerned about whether excessively high ticket prices can be welcomed by the audience. Therefore, in the case of hesitation and hesitation on all sides, the Western film distributors chose the last resort, stopping the supply of new films to protest. It is said that before this matter was declared a breakdown, someone proposed that, in addition to the minimum price limit, the ticket prices of first-run cinemas may be stipulated flexibly, with a base price of five jiao calculated based on the cost of living index every half month, in order to seek a permanent solution. However, the Social Affairs Bureau stated that it would not consider this matter, and the Western film distributors also stated that they could not be satisfied with this figure. Currently, in order to break the deadlock, the cinema industry association has decided to hold an emergency meeting this afternoon and invite all relevant parties to participate in the discussion to find a more reasonable solution. Before a concrete solution is obtained that satisfies the Social Affairs Bureau and the Western film distributors, the new films previewed by the city's first-run cinemas will not be released. However, they are prepared to negotiate with domestic film distributors to show the latest domestic films when the seat sales of old films are low, in order to overcome this period of lean times.</p>
<h3>Zhejiang Natives in Shanghai Hold Reception for Chen Yi</h3>

<h3>Labor-Management Dispute in Tea Industry, Supplementary Measures Agreed to Resolve</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The employees of tea shops in this city had previously had a dispute over their salaries. Yesterday, the Social Affairs Bureau convened representatives from both labor and management to mediate. Because the previous record was a flexible regulation that was prone to disputes, the two sides agreed to revise the supplementary measures, and the dispute was resolved. The important points are: (1) The base salary of Category C employees must not be lower than 26 yuan. If employees have no faults in the future, their base salary will increase by 2 to 3 yuan each year. (2) For apprentices who start in the fourth year after completing their apprenticeship, their base salary will be raised to 23 yuan. After one year, their base salary will be raised to 26 yuan for Category C, and thereafter, it will increase by 2 yuan every year, the same as the treatment of Category C employees.</p>

<h3>Child Laborer Swallows Corrosive Liquid and Commits Suicide; Father Files Complaint Against Cotton Weaving Factory</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Zhu Yougen, a 54-year-old printing worker from Haimen at the Qingda Cotton Weaving Factory at No. 7 Tangjia Lane, Dadongmen, Nanshi, residing at No. 69 Weiwu Lane, Jumen Road, Nanshi, introduced his son, Xiaofa, now 20 years old, to work at the factory. However, the factory did not pay Xiaofa the same wages as other workers, resulting in Xiaofa's meager monthly income and inability to maintain a living. Previously, he had planned to borrow 100,000 yuan in legal currency from the factory to buy rice, but the factory refused. Xiaofa, stimulated by this, swallowed the corrosive nitric acid used by the factory and committed suicide. Afterwards, Zhu's father filed a complaint with the District Prosecutor's Office against the factory, alleging that the factory's improper storage of the corrosive liquid led to the tragedy, and accusing the factory of assisting suicide. The District Prosecutor's Office summoned the plaintiff Zhu Yougen, the defendant Chen Wenhao, the factory owner of Qingda, and the managers Chuan Shengsheng and Chen Shiwena to court for questioning yesterday morning. The court then ordered a rescheduling of the trial, and the defendants were released on bail.</p>
<h3>Impersonating Plainclothes Police to Extort Money; Two Criminals Arrested Together</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Wu Changsheng, from Kunshan, residing at No. 14, Lane 173, Xinhui Road, possessed a 45-caliber Mauser pistol. Accompanied by his friend Zhang Zhiming (21 years old, from Nantong), he impersonated plainclothes police officers at around 10 pm yesterday at Room 504 of the Baxian Hotel on Yongshou Street, extorting 20 million yuan from Zhou Peixiang (31 years old, from Ningbo, nicknamed "Limpy"), a fruit merchant. Zhou saw through the scheme and went out to report it to the Songshan Road Police Precinct. Seeing that their plan had failed, Wu and Zhang hurriedly fled on a pedicab. When they reached the entrance of the Longmen Theater on Zhongzheng Road Central, they were suddenly caught up by the police officers who had been following them and arrested together. They were taken to the police station for questioning. According to their confession, they had extorted 50 million yuan in legal currency from Qian Agui, a silk cotton broker at No. 28 Yongsheng Lane, Xujiahui Road, at 2 pm on the 26th, stating that they would collect the money on the morning of the 29th.

<h3>All-Night Petition Finally Resolved; Private School Teachers Return Satisfied; Mayor Agrees to Advance Loan of 5 Million to Each</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper's Dispatch] Approximately two to three hundred private elementary school teachers in this city have been petitioning the Education Bureau since 3:00 PM the day before yesterday regarding loan and rice allocation issues. Because they found the Education Bureau's response unsatisfactory, they remained gathered in the vicinity of Lin Sen Middle Road and Ma Dang Road overnight. Yesterday afternoon, around 4:00 PM, educational figures Du Zuozhou, Yang Weiyu, and Chen Bochui arrived to persuade them and reported on their negotiations with Mayor Wu. The petitioning crowd was deeply moved and gradually dispersed around 6:00 PM. The stalemate lasted for 27 hours. Fortunately, the authorities handled the situation with prudence, and no incidents occurred, which is a fortunate outcome.</p>
<p>Around 4:00 AM yesterday morning, a heavy rain fell. The petitioning crowd sitting in front of the Education Bureau were unable to withstand the rain and sought shelter in nearby stores. Shenjiang Hospital and some stores voluntarily opened their doors, inviting teachers inside to rest and providing tea.</p>
<p>Elementary School Students Form Teams to Offer Comfort: Around 7:00 AM, elementary school students formed teams to comfort the teachers, soliciting money to purchase sesame cakes and fried dough sticks to provide them with food. In total, more than one hundred students gathered. The gate of the Education Bureau on Lin Sen Middle Road was not opened. The petitioning crowd used the steps in front of the gate as a command platform. Several leaders issued orders, and the four large characters "Anti-Hunger Arena" were posted. Banners of support and encouragement were hung, sent by the Jiaotong University Student Union, the Teachers College, the Kindergarten Teachers College, Wanfang Silk and Cloth Store, a group of parents, a group of middle school students, the China Vocational School, and others – thirteen banners in total. The walls were covered with red and green slogans and cartoons, with hardly any space left. Singing and shouting rose and fell, mixed with tension and reaching an extreme.</p>
<p>The police station maintained a strict guard. Cars and pedestrians were not allowed to pass, but they did not interfere with the teachers' actions. Throughout the entire event, peace was maintained.</p>
<p>Small Episode with Three Messengers: Around 10:00 AM, three messengers visited the Education Bureau to seek instructions but refused to reveal their names or the schools where they worked. The Education Bureau investigated and discovered that one of them was Shu Yueqiao, who had reported Li Ze. He is currently a teacher at the New New Company Employee Children's School, but the school has not been registered with the Education Bureau. The other two were temporarily detained. After verifying their identities – one being Huang Jun (female, Qinde Elementary School Kindergarten) and the other being Chen Ming (male, Huamin Elementary School) – they were released because they were confirmed to be teachers.</p>
<p>Four Demands – Answers Obtained:</p>
<p>Around 4:00 PM, educational figures Du Zuozhou, Yang Weiyu, and Chen Bochui, accompanied by Zhu Juntian, the Director of the National Education Department, arrived, causing great excitement among the crowd. Du Zuozhou stated first: "I hope this matter will not be expanded. I have negotiated with Mayor Wu and Director Li. The answers to your four demands are as follows: (1) A loan of 10 million yuan will be issued, with 60 billion yuan borrowed from the City Bank first, and 5 million yuan will be advanced to each person. The remaining 5 million yuan will be negotiated with the Four Joint Offices for allocation before the summer vacation. (2) Regarding the rice allocation issue, the reason why many schools have not received rice is due to the limited number of personnel in the Civil Affairs Committee. However, the guaranteed shortage of rice will be cleared in the short term. In the future, if any embezzlement of rice is discovered, report it to the Education Bureau to exchange with the Civil Affairs Committee. (3) The issue of maintaining the original price for rice allocation during the summer vacation from July to September is not something the Education Bureau can decide, but the Education Bureau is responsible for negotiating with relevant parties. As for returning one dou of household rice, the Education Bureau is not aware of this matter and will be responsible for negotiating with the Civil Affairs Committee. (4) Regarding the issue of increasing the 130,000 yuan subsidy, the Education Bureau has decided to strive to increase it in the Municipal Council starting from the next semester." Subsequently, Yang Weiyu, Chen Bochui, and others persuaded the petitioning crowd, offering much encouragement and comfort. Zhu Juntian then advised everyone to disperse, return home to rest, and that their demands could be expected to be resolved.</p>
<p>Shouting Gratitude Before Leaving:</p>
<p>By this point, the petitioning crowd was exhausted and hoarse, extremely tired. Seeing that the problem had been largely resolved, they no longer insisted. Although Tai Shuangqiu and Shu Yueqiao claimed that Mayor Wu only promised 5 million yuan, with the remaining 5 million only being issued if it could be borrowed, believing that Du and others were contradicting each other, almost causing another disturbance. Fortunately, the situation had eased, and the private school teachers trusted Du and others' guarantees, and they gradually dispersed before 6:00 PM. Before deciding to leave, one of the elementary school teacher representatives stood up and shouted: "Our petition has achieved considerable results. Thank you to the police officers, the reporters, and the members of society who care about us!" The 27 hours of commotion finally came to an end.</p>
<h3>Director of Education Bureau Issues Written Statement</h3>
<p>Director Li of the Education Bureau issued a written statement yesterday stating: "The treatment of private elementary school employees should originally be the responsibility of the school's board of directors and principal, and this bureau can provide no further advice. However, in recent times, prices have soared, and this bureau sympathizes with the teachers' difficult living conditions. In addition to asking the municipal government to issue a subsidy of 2 billion yuan to subsidize teachers and staff, it has also asked the mayor to negotiate with the Civil Affairs Committee to issue fair-priced rice and to negotiate with the Four Joint Offices for loans. In terms of the welfare of private school teachers, the Education Bureau has asked itself if it has fulfilled its responsibilities. However, a small number of private school teachers, not understanding the process, came to the bureau to petition, insisting that the Education Bureau guarantee that each private school teacher would borrow 10 million yuan, and that it must be allocated by the end of this month. They do not know that the Education Bureau is not a lending institution, and forcing the Education Bureau to bear a responsibility that it cannot bear can be said to be a misunderstanding of the target. Later, the mayor summoned representatives of private school teachers and staff groups to give a formal response. Before the Four Joint Offices approved it, the Municipal Bank would advance the loan to relieve the urgent need, and each person would be allowed to borrow 5 million yuan, totaling 65 billion yuan. Most of the representatives thought it was satisfactory, but the petitioners still gathered and refused to disperse. After questioning the petitioning representatives, the police station discovered that there were a small number of people with unclear identities mixed among them, and there were also many elementary school students involved. Whether their actions are similar to a normal teachers' group, and whether they are being exploited by others, this bureau is investigating. This time, we are deeply grateful to the police officers of the Police Headquarters and the Songshan Branch for maintaining order day and night, so that no accidents occurred."</p>

<h3>Gold Control Bureau Assists in Stabilizing Prices; Large-Scale Inspection of Firms and Banks; Bills, Warehouse Pledges, and Loans All Subject to Inspection</h3>
<p>To stabilize prices, the Shanghai Gold Control Bureau, in coordination with the municipal authorities, has taken emergency measures. Since the 28th, it has intensified its inspection of firms and banks. All personnel below the Chief Auditor of the bureau have been mobilized, and a large number of staff have been borrowed from the Auditing Department of the Central Bank to assist in the work. This is the first large-scale inspection since the bureau was established. The number of people mobilized and the scope of the inspection are unprecedented. The bureau's inspection has three major objectives: (1) Inspecting suspicious bills from firms and banks at the bill exchange; (2) Inspecting suspicious clients dealing with firms and banks; (3) Inspecting firms and banks' affiliated warehouse pledge accounts. All three of these situations are sufficient to create facts of hoarding, manipulation, and speculative profit-making. The impact is very serious. If the bureau finds any suspicious circumstances or speculative hoarding of goods during this inspection, it will deal with them severely according to the law. As for the firms and banks that have already been penalized, such as replacing managers, it is waiting for the order from the Ministry of Finance to arrive before it can be handled according to the law.</p>
<h3>Constant Inflow of Idle Funds; Stock Market Trend Stable</h3>
<p>The stock market continued to be lively yesterday morning. The direction of idle funds is still constantly flowing in. Therefore, although the industry center's intentions were weak, the burden of the holiday and various unfavorable influences were swept away halfway. The lining of small stocks and strong stocks was eager, and the situation was somewhat gratifying.</p>
<p>At the opening in the morning, the market opened lower due to the shadow of the industry center and the trip of a senior official of the Securities Exchange to Beijing, which caused people to feel tired. Yongsha opened at 5200 yuan. Nos. 163, 157, and the bank group sold to 5140 yuan. Nos. 176 and 145, etc. came in and rose to 5320 yuan. The agency fee opened at 71 yuan and 77 yuan, which required five days to bear, so it was inevitably a small disc. In the end, idle funds penetrated everywhere, and small stocks maintained their signs of strength, with Neiyi Huaxin Lian rising to the limit. The securities group and the Guangdong group both entered, and the price rose to 5410 yuan. Hong Kong Electric rose slightly to one and a half jiao. Nos. 104, 13, 89, and the Guangdong group No. 202 continued to sell vigorously. Nos. 155 and the bank group also closed, and the noon closing retreated to 5230 yuan. Compared with the previous closing, except for Lian Nei Yi Hua Xin, which rose to the limit, and Xinguang, which was still flat, Yongsha Xinhe Jingfu Tongyi Rongfeng Wuhe Zhabei slightly decreased, and the rest were slightly increased. The off-market prices of unlisted stocks were stable, except for Shijie, which rose by 10%, and Dasheng, which rose by 50%.</p>
<p>Public Bonds: Yesterday, they were slightly weak. Tongbing opened at 620,000 in the morning and once rose to 650,000, but then fell to 560,000 before stabilizing. The turnover was 3 million, which was 20,000 lower for A, B, D, and E, and 10,000 lower for C.</p>
<p>Foreign Stocks: Yesterday, due to the authorities' surveillance and various concerns, trading could not be carried out normally. It was not until 11:30 AM that trading was opened. Hong Kong Electric rose slightly to one and a half jiao. Yisha once fell to the 10.1 million mark, and most of the time it hovered around 10.5 million, which was 50% lower than the previous closing price of Yisha Zhiban. Shipping fell by 10%, and the rest fell slightly.</p>
<h3>Banks and Firms Settle Accounts at the End of June; Money Market Slightly Tight</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper's Dispatch] June has ended, and commercial banks and firms are settling accounts for half a year. The money market is slightly tight, and the price increase trend has also slowed down. Banks and firms will be closed for two days starting tomorrow. It is reported that most of the banks and firms in this city have made considerable profits. Among them, those with strong capital and good management have made very high profits. After deducting all expenses such as public reserve funds, donations, taxes, and employee bonuses, each share of capital can obtain a net profit of about 2,000 yuan. However, judging from the total amount of deposits in banks converted into prices, the strength of the current banks and firms is very empty. Before the war, the strength of banks could fully control industry. Currently, in economic relations, banks are actually subordinate to factories. The so-called prosperity is entirely a superficial phenomenon, except for a few who own foreign exchange positions.</p>
<p>Yesterday's money market was tight because the end of June was approaching, and national banks and bureaus were tightening. In the exchange of money and bills, banks and bureaus were short by a total of 145.97 billion, the Central Bank was short by 71.74 billion, the Bank of China was over by 41.79 billion, the Bank of Communications was short by 38.09 billion, the Farmers Bank was short by 8.39 billion, the China Trust Bureau was short by 58.42 billion, the Postal Remittance Bureau was over by 4.61 billion, and the Central Cooperative Treasury was short by 15.73 billion. The large exchange of commercial banks and firms was over by 142.84 billion, and the small exchange was over by 107.42 billion. The amount of foreign banks' overage created a new record, totaling 107.42 billion yuan.</p>
<h3>Banks and Firms Transfer Funds; National Banks Allow Remittances</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper's Dispatch] The opening of domestic remittances has been implemented since the day before yesterday, but it is limited to interbank remittances. Whether it is the transfer of funds by national banks and bureaus or commercial banks and firms, the Central Bank can provide unlimited remittances. The area includes all parts of the country. It is reported that remittances from national banks and bureaus will be handled first today, and remittances from commercial banks and firms will begin tomorrow.</p>
<h3>Market Conditions in Various Regions</h3>

<p>Guangzhou [This Newspaper's Guangzhou Dispatch on the 29th] The price of goods in Guangzhou gradually declined yesterday. The market trend of grain turned sharply downward, falling by about 1.5 million per dan. The prices of other goods generally fell by 10%. The Hong Kong dollar also fell to 45 million. However, according to Shantou News: The price of rice in the area has soared, reaching a high price of 50 million yuan per market stone.</p>
<h3>Foreign Rice and Cotton Arrive in Shanghai</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper's Dispatch] The "Da Zhongshan" ship, managed by the Hualun Foreign Firm, arrived in Shanghai yesterday morning with 26,730 bags of rice from San Francisco, USA. It is currently berthed at the Rihui Port Wharf for unloading. In addition, the "Xueer Fu Pilaer", a new ship of the Zha Hua Company, arrived in port on the 27th, having come to Shanghai from the US via Mumbai, India.

<h3>Off-Market Sales Prices Hover at High Levels; Rice Still Has No Formal Transactions; Flour Owners Discouraged, Prices See Downstream</h3>
<p>The rice market is still restricted by the community bureau at the price of last Friday, and no one sells it. Although the production area has seen a short return, it is still higher than the price of last Friday, and there are still no formal transactions. The Civil Affairs Committee continues to sell 6,000 shi of rice, and the price remains the same. Off-market transaction prices are still at their peak. White japonica and thin rice are each 18.5 million, early rice is 17.5 million, Jiangxi Jixian is 17 million, and coarse japonica is 15.5 million. Starting today, the grain market will be closed for three days due to the semi-annual settlement.</p>
<p>Flour trading is normal, and prices are slightly downstream. Because Wuxi prices have fallen sharply and the money market is tight, the owners are discouraged and sell successively, especially the supply of miscellaneous brands of flour is more abundant. Laoche flour is 4.85 million, and Bingshen is 4.75 million, and they all retreat to the limit price, which is about 200,000 lower than the previous day. Bran is 3.9 million at the original price, and wheat opens at 6 million.</p>
<p>There are still no formal transactions in miscellaneous grains. Both parties entering and exiting are mostly watching, and it was not until the close that they started trading slightly, standing at the price of last Friday. Hankou zhadou 8.2 million, Che Dou entered 1.8 million, Maojiashi Qingcan no bag cargo opened at 7.2 million, Yuanmai traded more, Kunshan Yuanmai 6.3 million, Changdun Yuanmai 6.4 million, secondary Nai Ma 18 million yuan.</p>
<p>Edible oil only has various oil factories opening and selling soybean oil to supply the needs of the city, and the price is 50,000 yuan lower than the closing price of last Friday, which is 27.45 million yuan. All factories are the same, and this is not a formal transaction either. It is a special price reduction to assist in suppressing prices. However, there are few porridge and more monks, and there are many who are left out. In addition, the small cart sesame oil is 49 million yuan, and the Doubing first market factory opened at 4.04 million, and then the retail investors were forced by the money market and sold a lot. The Shenrenji cake retreated to 3.95 million, which was a small 30,000 to 40,000 yuan lower than the dark market on the previous day.</p>
<h3>Pricing Method for Unified Purchase of Cotton Approved by Ministry of Economic Affairs for Implementation</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper's Nanjing Dispatch on the 29th] The interim measures for pricing of cotton for unified purchase drafted by the National Cotton, Yarn and Cloth Management Committee have been approved by the Ministry of Economic Affairs. The ministry has also telegraphed the Cotton Management Committee to implement them immediately. The details of the method are as follows: (1) This committee formulates this method to adapt to the actual situation of the cotton market in various places, and to seek fairness and rationality of prices for the unified purchase of cotton. (2) The pricing of cotton prices in each market shall be determined by this committee and its offices in various places in conjunction with China Textile Company and its offices in various places, based on the actual supply of cotton in the cotton market within their respective jurisdictions, and with reference to the prices of rice, yarn, cloth and other daily necessities, and the prices shall be determined daily according to the origin, type and grade of cotton. The prices shall be telegraphed to this committee for record. This price shall be the reference price. (3) In areas where this committee has not yet set up offices, but China Textile Company has set up offices, the office shall draft the prices on its behalf and telegraph them to this committee for record. This price shall be the reference price. (4) All cotton merchants entrusted by this committee to purchase cotton and self-purchasing factories shall purchase within the scope of the reference price and shall not raise prices to compete for purchase. (5) All cotton merchants entrusted by this committee to purchase cotton shall compile a report on the type, quantity, grade and price of cotton purchased on a daily basis and submit it to the office that originally determined the price for verification and forwarding to this committee for verification on the same day as the basis for the settlement of the price after the cotton is shipped to Shanghai for consolidation. (6) If the location of the cotton purchase by each cotton merchant is too far away from the office that originally determined the price and the report cannot be delivered directly, it may be reported to the office in charge by telegram on the same day for verification and forwarding. (7) These measures shall be submitted to the Ministry of Economic Affairs for approval and implementation.</p>
<h3>Tight Credit and Weak Demand for Cotton Yarn and Cloth; Asking Prices Soft</h3>
<p>Yesterday's cotton yarn market was bleak due to the strict surveillance by the police in the market and the prohibition of all idlers from watching outside the door. In addition, the end of June account settlement was approaching, credit was tight, customer sales were sluggish, and many bulls sold off, causing the market to fall. Forty-two blue phoenix fine yarn opened late at 11:15 AM, opening low at 800 million yuan. It was unable to recover halfway, and later it rose to 830 million yuan at the end due to retail investors absorbing the low, which was 50 million yuan lower than the previous day. The prices of other coarse and fine yarns also generally fell by 10% to 15%.</p>
<p>Yesterday's cotton cloth market was still prohibited due to the fact that the supply and demand of faucet fine cloth and gentleman cloth were not yet normal, but the asking price outside the market has been soft. The speculative gangs were generally watching, and there were many new buyers and old bulls reselling. Faucet fine cloth has dropped from 20.7 million to 19.5 million, and the final 20 million has also been sold. Gentleman cloth also ended with a small 20.8 million, which was 1.5 to 1.6 million lower than the previous day outside the market. Five-fortune fine cloth in the market plummeted by 2.3 million. In addition, only Shilin cloth, blue cloth and raw cloth continued to be popular, while the rest fluctuated.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Food Announces Newly Revised Measures for Grain Pledge and Loan (Continued)</h3>
<p>(6) When grain merchants use loans and remittances to purchase grain, the local government authorities shall closely supervise and assess them, and strictly prohibit them from being used for other purposes.</p>
<p>(7) Grain merchants should purchase and transport grain from grain-abundant areas or distribution markets when using loans and remittances, and shall not compete to purchase, thereby stimulating grain prices.</p>
<p>(8) When grain is scarce or grain prices fluctuate, the local grain authorities may order grain merchants to redeem their pledged grain for sale in the market in advance. If grain merchants violate this order, they shall be forcibly purchased with reference to the cost of each batch of grain plus profit, and the local authorities shall evaluate and sell it to regulate people's food. In addition to paying off the principal and interest of the pledge bank, the balance shall be returned to the grain merchant, and the handling situation shall be reported to the Ministry of Food for record.</p>
<p>(9) If a grain merchant violates the provisions of Articles 6 or 7 of these Measures, and the local grain authorities verify that the violation is true, in addition to notifying the lending bank to recover all the principal and interest of the pledge, the grain merchant's business license shall be revoked, and the case may be transferred to the judicial authorities for punishment according to law.</p>
<p>(10) The local grain authorities and the Four Joint Branches or their designated banks shall inspect the purchase, transportation, storage, pledge and sales of grain pledged by grain merchants and the amount of remittance at any time, and report them to the Ministry of Food and the Four Joint Headquarters for record on a monthly basis.</p>
<p>(11) Government agencies that handle grain pledge loans may refer to the provisions of Articles 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7 of these measures.</p>
<p>(12) These measures may be amended at any time if there are any matters not covered.</p>
<p>(13) These measures shall be announced and implemented after the Ministry of Food consults and agrees with the Four Joint Headquarters. (End)</p>

<h3>World Games Farewell Match, Another Victory Over Enkas, Fifty to Thirty-Six</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] In the World Games' sixth match in Shanghai, they faced Enkas again yesterday, winning by a score of 50 to 36, a fourteen-point victory. The score at halftime was 26 to 20. After a few days of rest, the players were noticeably rusty, especially in the first ten minutes of the game. Even the usually calm Wen Hua was unstable, missing all four shots, far from his usual accurate state. Fortunately, after ten minutes, the performance gradually returned to normal, and Enkas gradually faltered.</p>
<p>The World Games team started with the five tigers: Huang, Bao, Cai, Wu, and Li. Wen Hua's performance was not smooth, missing two shots, and Gorbunkov saw the opportunity, scoring the first point. Shi Qiao doubled the return, after which the game fell into a chaotic state. Enkas led by one or two points several times. At 14 to 12, Li Shiqiao scored two shots, reversing the situation. From then on, it was smooth sailing, and Enkas never had another chance to rise. The score at halftime was 26 to 20, with the World Games team leading by three goals.</p>
<p>When the second half began, the World Games team's lineup changed, but the momentum remained strong. Song Yuan, Wen Hua, and Tian Xi scored, making it 37 to 26, with the World Games team leading by eleven points. With seven minutes remaining, the automatic timer suddenly broke down and was replaced with an electric clock. Both sides scored with long shots, and in the end, the World Games team defeated Enkas again with a score of 50 to 36.</p>
<p>World Games Team: Shots, Penalties, Fouls, Points</p>

<h3>Interpretation of a New Poem</h3>
<p>— Yu Qin</p>
<p>1.  Longing — Bing Xin</p>
<p>Hiding from longing.</p>
<p>Putting on a fur coat.</p>
<p>Walking out of the brightly lit and quiet house.</p>
<p>In the small path, the moon shines brightly,</p>
<p>Dead branches –</p>
<p>On the snowy ground</p>
<p>Writhe across each other writing of longing.</p>
<p>The word "love" today is just like the ancient Chinese word for "longing." The poem's title, "Longing," is a general term for the sentiment of love. The first part describes the attempt to avoid the emotion of love. The emergence of love emotions is always triggered by various scenes, as the saying goes, "scenes evoke emotions." Among the scenes encountered indoors, none is more effective than a solitary lamp. A solitary lamp accompanies a solitary guest; its light reflects the person's shadow, illuminating the wall. Looking back, one immediately feels lonely, and thus the emotion of love arises. Although the emotion arises, the beloved is difficult to see, so one cannot help but feel perplexed by "Tonight, my form and shadow are together before the lamp," and "There is no one to share the spring cold." This poem describes a winter night, so the latter part mentions the snowy ground. Winter cold is far more intense than spring cold, so the depth of feeling is even greater than in other seasons. If the remaining lamp is dim, hazy and sleepy, as in the saying, "The blue lamp dimly flickers," then because the shadow it casts is unclear, the emotion of love arises but is not deep, the anxiety is not great. If the lamplight is bright, the wick is fully lit, as in the saying, "A clear night with a bright lamp," then because the shadow it casts is clear, the emotion of love arises both deeply and greatly. Moreover, when it is late at night and people are quiet, at the time of "Night has passed three watches" and "Alone quietly," this is already enough to create "A deeper night, people gone, silence," and to evoke infinite love emotions, let alone "But the lonely lamp reflects the wall." On such a night, alone in an empty room, keeping company with the lamp, even if one trims the wick, it only increases sorrow. Wei Zhuang did not say, "Trimming the lamp and writing out red letters, I am still bored." Li Qingzhao also once "Played with trimming the lamp wick in the late night." The reason for playing with the lamp wick was probably "Embracing deep sorrow, I have no good dreams." Because it is so, why not leave this empty room, leave this solitary lamp, and imitate the ancient woman's "Walking alone out of the secluded gate," going out for a stroll to dispel sorrow. However, the outdoor temperature is not as good as indoors, especially at night, so one has to open the wardrobe, take a fur coat, and put it on before leaving the room. The latter part describes the unexpected summoning of the emotion of love. In human affairs, generally, what one intends to harm, one ends up helping to achieve, what one intends to avoid, one ends up encountering. The protagonist of this poem has already left the room, walking alone in the small path, fully believing that they can dispel their sorrow by doing so. Even if the sorrow cannot be completely dispelled, at least a large part of the sorrow should be removed. But things are far from that. The gentle moon not only exists tonight but is particularly bright tonight, bright to the point where it illuminates everything without exception, with nothing escaping its gaze, like a person spying on an object, determined to catch it. Thus, the protagonist of this poem is again discovered by the moon, which is brighter than the lamplight. The person's shadow is on the ground, lonely and alone, and the emotion of love that one wanted to avoid suddenly strikes again – a mighty army marching swiftly, secretly entering the heart's capital – and countless strands of sorrow arise from this. This is not all. Looking again at the white snowy ground, it is doubly clean under the moonlight, and it seems to have words of love written on it. They are scattered everywhere, catching the eye at every turn. Examining the reason, one sees that the dead branches of the old trees are illuminated by the moonlight, and the dead branches are like hundreds of writing brushes, taking advantage of this rare white paper to write large characters of love. Thus, although the protagonist of this poem wants to avoid the emotion of love, everything serves to evoke an even greater and deeper emotion of love.</p>
<p>This poem is concise and profound. The meaning is beyond words, quite capturing the essence of old poetry and lyrics. And the last sentence is derived from Zhou Meicheng's "Six Ugly": "Fearing that there are still words of longing on the broken red," further demonstrating the poet's skillful use of old poetry and lyrics.</p>
<p>2.  Paper Boat Sent to Mother — Bing Xin</p>
<p>I never recklessly discard a piece of paper</p>
<p>Always keeping—keeping,</p>
<p>Folding it into a very small boat,</p>
<p>Throwing it from the deck into the sea</p>
<p>Some are blown by the heavenly wind into the windows of the boat,</p>
<p>Some are dampened by the waves, sticking to the bow</p>
<p>I am still unflaggingly folding every day,</p>
<p>Always hoping that one can float to the place I want it to go.</p>
<p>Mother; if you see a very small white boat in your dream,</p>
<p>Don't be surprised that it enters your dream for no reason.</p>
<p>This is folded with tears by your beloved daughter,</p>
<p>Ten thousand waters and a thousand mountains, asking it to carry her love and sorrow back.</p>
<p>The subject matter of this poem is not only novel but also carries profound meaning. Looking only at the words "paper boat," one feels it is monotonous and childish. Looking again at the three words "sent to mother," one feels the poetic meaning is elegant and pure. Although it carries a childish flavor, it further shows its unparalleled innocence. The first part describes folding the paper boat and throwing it into the sea. The hearts of children are mostly full of innocence. Because children play more, their toys are also not uncommon. Among the most common toys, none is better than folding paper games. I also used to love this in my youth, folding paper into countless shapes, including clothes and pants, tables and chairs, towers, and also boats. Because boats can float on the water and be carried away by the wind, they are most pleasing to me, and so it is with other children. Although this poem is written by the author in the first person, it actually contains the common group of children within it. It is a glimpse of the children's life. It is best to fold a paper boat without creases, folding it into a small and exquisite shape in one go, and then putting it in the river to float on the surface, carried away by the wind, which has a secluded charm. However, the author does not put it in the river but throws it into the sea, because this poem is written by the author after going abroad across the ocean. The middle part describes the fate of the paper boat and the continuation of its work. Because the boat is light and thin, and the seawater is turbulent like madness, it cannot maintain its original speed and direction of flow. It is fortunate that it is not submerged! Some are blown into the boat's window, and some stick to the bow. However, the author's entrustment to this small paper boat is far-reaching, and they will definitely not give up folding because of this setback. Therefore, they continue to do the work of folding boats every day. The last part describes the reason for sending the paper boat. Generally, travelers who leave their hometowns all have a feeling of homesickness. The farther they are from their hometown, the deeper their feeling. Traveling through ten thousand waters and a thousand mountains, their longing for their hometown also amounts to ten thousand bushels and a thousand bells. However, each mountain and river in these ten thousand waters and a thousand mountains is watched and hoped for by their mothers at home. Thinking of the young birds feeding back to their parents, the filial thought of not being able to return to care for them arises spontaneously. "Returning dreams are often of the hills and trees beyond the screen," already belongs to homesickness. If there are external scenes to stimulate it, such as "mournful forest birds" or "cold pestle pounding homesickness," then the thought of "lingering in the courtyard" arises, and the sorrow of "Where is my hometown at sunset?" is born. On such a day, the traveler's feeling of longing for their hometown and the wind's memory of Mount Qi and Mount Ju are almost endless. This poem not only wants to write about their longing for their mother but also wants to write about their mother's love. A loving mother's heart for her child is meticulous. When her child travels far away, she leans on the door and looks, waiting for their return, or waiting for a letter of their safety. At night, she dreams of their return, as in "The high hall should dream of their return." However, if a small white boat suddenly appears in her dream, she cannot help but be surprised. Why? Because it enters her dream for no reason. If she knows the origin of this small white boat, that it was folded with tears by her beloved daughter, and that what is carried in the boat is all her daughter's love and sorrow, then the loving mother will also be filled with mixed emotions of sorrow and joy. The hardships of wind and frost are what she worries about, and suddenly receiving news of their safety is what she delights in. If so, then the feelings of the mother and daughter are able to converge with the help of this small white boat.</p>
<p>This poem expresses homesickness and longing for the mother, entrusting emotions to objects, and obtaining the proper nature of the heart. The last line can be said to have come from: "How can a homesick letter be delivered? The returning geese follow the Luo River." Although the small white boat in this poem is not a homesick letter, what it carries is equal to a homesick letter. The only difference is that the messenger is one is a goose, and the other is the sea.</p>

<h3>White Lotus</h3>
<p>— Jin Liu</p>
<h3>Painting's Realm</h3>
<p>— JS</p>
<p>——One of Arabian Nights</p>
<p>In my mind, there is a painting's realm: a slanting sun over an ancient ferry, a few returning crows, misty and boundless ripples, rising wisps of cooking smoke, serene, everything is serene, a wisp of twilight at the edge of the forest, shrouded in the solemnity of dusk.</p>
<p>I yearn for the painting's realm in my heart.</p>
<p>——Suddenly, a dark shadow slowly moves through the dim twilight, walking from the forest towards the ferry dock. Now it is slow again, heavy yet hurried, somewhat like a sleepwalking patient. Slowly I hear a sound, as if that mad old woman from the play "The Big Thunderstorm," like a ghost, appears before my eyes, running and shouting:</p>
<p>"The storm is coming, -- the end of the world is at hand!" The repetitive and labored voice trembles in the twilight, echoing, intimate and familiar. Again, it is a familiar friend, with a bitter expression, holding tightly to a heavy heart, listlessly pacing the waterside, groaning at the dock, lamenting in the vast dusk.</p>
<p>Suddenly, an explosion, like the previous sound, but now it has become a sign before a volcanic eruption, shouting: "Shanghai is in trouble, the Bund of Shanghai -- Shanghai is about to collapse!"</p>
<p>Then I suddenly realize that the place where he lingers is not some painting's realm, nor is there a slanting sun over an ancient ferry. What appears before our eyes is precisely the Bund of the Huangpu River.</p>
<p>Listening again to that shouting, sometimes distant, sometimes near, sometimes bright, sometimes silent; the one shouting is not some friend, nor is it some madman, but someone who has lost their footing and drowned in the river. I am frightened. Looking more closely, he transforms into hundreds and thousands of drowning people. The Huangpu River before my eyes has become a bloody pool under the Bridge of Helplessness exposed in the Hell Transformation Zone. The men and women falling into the water are like vegetable vendors crossing the Pudong River, a basket of radishes overturned in the heart of the river. The radishes float and sink in the water, one trying to emerge, crashing into another, unable to withstand the impact of a wave, or pushing against each other, they all sink again. Those who have sunk still try to emerge, their mouths constantly shouting, yelling, but gradually their strength is exhausted and their voices become hoarse, some sounding unclear. That voice also changes into --</p>
<p>"Save the drowning people!"</p>
<p>The cooking smoke had long since vanished, and the crows had disappeared. The dusk is visibly deep, and many ox-headed and horse-faced demons holding three-pronged forks are standing by the bloody pool in the twilight, straightening their sharp forks, aiming at those drowning weaklings. Stabbing once, again and again, at those struggling to emerge, those still shouting for help, stabbing into the eternal abyss, a stream of fresh blood gushing out with the tip of the fork as it is pulled out. The fresh blood floats on the water, steaming, and the corpse silently sinks, never to surface again.</p>
<p>Then the imps look triumphantly at the river water dyed red with hot blood, laughing wildly with hideous laughter. The cruel laughter ripples through the heavy air, shaking many ornate glass windows, rattling them. Inside the windows sit gentlemen and ladies with large nearsighted, color-blind, even blind eyes, appreciating the sunset on the river. At this moment, they cannot help but feel a bit shocked, a flicker in their hearts, but they immediately cover it up with a kind of composed mockery.</p>
<p>However, the hideous laughter by the river has not stopped, and entire boats of radishes are capsizing into the river. The men and women floating and sinking in the water huddle closer, squeeze harder, and trample even more fiercely. The horse-faces stab again and again with their forks, like so many points, and the hot blood spurts out like a showerhead.</p>
<p>This is the fall of souls that even Jesus cannot save, the destruction of lives that even Buddha cannot deliver. Occasionally, one or two enthusiastic people, with bitter expressions, holding heavy hearts, utter the voice of a prophet, recounting the absurd stories of sending charcoal in the snow from ancient times; but no one listens, no one understands. Unable to withstand the surging tides, they are soon swept into the raging waves, allowing the following waves to chase the preceding ones, the big waves to cover the small ones, and finally they are submerged into the water, sinking into an even deeper abyss. Even those gentlemen and ladies who think they are enjoying the drowning of others will, in the blink of an eye, capsize into the heart of the river like radishes; the result of eating people is still being eaten. There is no exception.</p>
<p>Thus --</p>
<p>The painting's realm in my heart, in the blink of an eye, turns into a dark night, the earth is deathly silent, there are a few sparse stars in the sky like jade beads, and a few fishing lights across the river; perhaps it is fishermen from afar casting their tattered nets, wanting to net the dregs of history. A loud sound, desolate and drawn out, a lone wild goose lamenting the past flies across the sky. The shadow of the goose disappears, and the fishermen fall into dreams.</p>
<h3>Recent World Literary Scene</h3>
<p>— Zhao Jingshen</p>
<p>Spanish Poet Lorca</p>
<p>The recent English translation and publication of three tragedies written by the Spanish poet Federico Garcia Lorca is a major event in the literary world. Among them, "The House of Bernarda Alba," the best of the three, has not had any other translation besides the English version. All three plays are very well translated, and can be considered authoritative translations. The translators are O'Connell and Graham-Lujan, who have translated all of Lorca's works. These tragedies range from prose dialogues to tense lyrical passages. "Yerma" is a revised version of a previous translation, while "Blood Wedding" is a new translation. The poet's brother, Francisco, wrote a preface that is both elegant and accessible, appealing to both scholars and general readers.</p>
<p>In order of writing, Blood Wedding, Yerma, and The House of Alba are Lorca's works from the last three years, representing the highest development of his artistic central tendency. This is what his brother called: "Recapturing tradition and expressing it in modern idioms." After the first two plays were performed on the Spanish stage, they were immediately hailed as masterpieces, and his works were seen as being in the tradition of Lope de Vega and Calderon, and not just the works of a modern writer. Like his predecessors, he placed poetry on a serious stage. He valued poetic meaning over realism. Blood Wedding is almost entirely lyrical dialogue, but it is more moving and more dramatic than prose. The House of Alba is particularly successful in its use of symbolism and the tense emotions of the characters. The play is simple, economical, and structurally complete.</p>
<p>These three heroic tragedies are completely Spanish, with a strong local flavor.</p>
<p>There is also a "Lorca: Selected Poems," translated by Stephen Spender and J. L. Gili. Originally published in 1939, it has now been selected and republished. It can be said to be a representative work of Lorca. The preface by R. M. Nadal has been deleted, and the original Spanish text has also been omitted, probably to reduce the price. However, the inclusion of some new translations is a welcome development. It includes the complete translation of "Ode to Walt Whitman" and "Lament for Ignacio Sanchez Mejias," the latter of which is probably Lorca's greatest lyrical poem. This new edition also corrects some mistranslations and has been revised to be more faithful, aiming to achieve the rhythm of the original poem. These revisions are very successful.</p>
