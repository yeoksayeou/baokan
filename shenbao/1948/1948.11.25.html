<h3>國營交通事業加價過高　監院決提出糾正　輸機變爲專供豪富之交通工具</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿四日電〕國營交通事業加價過高問題，監院已決定向政院提出糾正案。該院交通委會廿四日下午三時例會中已獲通過，卽可備文送出。理由為：國家設置交通機構，原為服務大衆，便利多數人民。茲者，航空輪運票價過昂，其結果徒使機輪變為專供豪富巨賈往來之交通工具，而政府改善經管補充辦法實施以後，本月物價指數滬較八一九時上升八倍强，京市升七倍八，而本月輪運票價於十日間突增十七倍半，機票於一周間突增十九倍强，交部竟予核准，此種措施，顯有失當；而員工待遇，各該公司機關各別巧立名目，擅自增加津貼補助各費，致收價一再增高，而無補於事業之支用，仍須政府不斷補貼，亟應糾正。」該案係由監委冷曝東·孫式庵·馬耀南·唐鴻烈四氏署名提出。</p>
<p>今日監院交通委會會議係由召集委員張定華主席。會中除通過國營事業加價之糾正案外，尙討論以次各案：（一）郵政人事管理規則與政府法令抵觸，請予糾正案，決議，由院函主管機關糾正。（二）粵主席宋子文購備二人坐用之小型飛機六架，並令粵省各縣普修小型機塲，以便巡視各地政情案，監委唐鴻烈等，認為事近浪費，應為制止，當由在塲委員公推唐鴻烈，郭仲隗，鄂景福三人，負責草擬糾舉書。</p>

<p>〔中央社華盛頓廿三日電〕我國駐美大使顧維鈞，今晚呼籲美國以更多之援助，迅速畀予中國，以便阻遏共黨統治與控制之嚴重威脅。渠稱：若中國不幸而陷于共產黨統治之下、則亞洲將繼之沉淪，而與美國及世界其他愛好自由人士，有極大影響之自由戰爭至少已失敗一半。顧氏此次警告演說，係應電聞公司之邀請、而播講者，且此項演說新聞片，將在美國各電影院放映。渠稱：自中國方面言，必可有效運用美國此種援助，美國目前儘速以更多之援助接濟中國，卽等於維持美國人生活方式中，所充分表現之自由與民主。顧氏指出：當歐洲現正努力阻遏共產主義蔓延之時，亞洲却身受共產主義之嚴重打擊。共匪二百餘萬人，現已奪取東北九省，並進而攻擊華北及華中各地。又悉：顧氏及我國駐美武官皮宗闞定明晚在美國電視廣播站發表談話。</p>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓廿四日電〕此間今日得悉，蔣總統致杜魯門總統函曾希望麥帥出任美軍駐華代表團團長，以激勵士氣對共作戰。至少蔣氏曾向杜魯門建議，謂中國須一名將為助，此人須有極大之威望。惟此間對於任命麥帥為駐華軍事代表團團長事，恐未認眞加以考慮。此外並悉：美國對於大規模援華問題無論其最後如何決定，今後數年之內，美國援外經費須達數十億之鉅，當無疑義。美國當局現所看到之輪廓，有兩點顯而易見：卽一，杜魯門總統與國務卿馬歇爾如決定以為中國尙可挽救而加以援助，則至少將向新國會要求核准數億元，此不過開其端，任何新的援華計劃必為長期計劃，此後自當源源接濟。二，假定全中國不論有無美援，竟淪於共產黨統治，則美國並重建日本並使其經濟穩定，所費必更互。比因日太屆時與共產黨統治之中國通商必更困難。進一步言，共產黨統治之中國如在冷戰中積極敵視西方國家，則美國必須在西太平洋充實防務，所費亦必不貲。杜魯門與馬歇爾檢討對華政策目須顧及此種因素。馬氏約定今日再與總統晤談，此為三日來之第二次。美國全面援助中國剿共問題，尙須顧及蘇聯之動向，某當局認為此舉有引起美蘇兩國間接衝突之危險。此外，馬氏去留問題亦待褐曉。馬氏已定於上海時間明晨四時三十分舉行記者招待會，屆時當有重大宣布。</p>
<h3>霍夫曼杜魯門會談援華問題</h3>
<p>〔美國新聞處華盛頓廿三日電〕經合總署署長翟夫曼本日下午曾在白宮與杜魯門總統有所會商，事後渠告新聞記者謂，渠曾與總統討論總署援華問題，惟「極簡略」。</p>
<h3>美政府及國會接獲建議　派美軍萬名來華　美國家安全委會臨時會曾予討論</h3>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓廿三日電〕負責方面今日稱，美國如決定加緊援助中國，扭轉剿共戰事，美國駐華軍事顧問團軍官及士兵之人數必須自現在之一千名增至十倍至一萬名左右，其職權亦應自僅事訓練，擴充至指導及監督實際作戰，克有濟。政府及國會方面均己接到此種建議。國家安全委員會今日提前兩日在白宮舉行臨時會議，或已討論及此，惟美國駐華軍事顧問團人員增至一萬名之舉，須蔣總統能接受美國援助希臘之方式為前提。據此間軍事專家稱，此舉如能見諸事實，則在數個月內卽可遏阻共軍進展。以嚴格的軍事部份言，美軍援華計劃當包括（一）在國軍戰鬥兵團派遣美國軍官及士兵為顧問，（二）組織靈活之後勤部隊以利供應，並多設傷兵醫院，（三）加緊宣傳工作使美援宗旨為衆所周知，並振作士氣。此舉以數年為期，其經費須美金五十億元。經濟部份經費並不在內。今年美國軍事援華費不過一億二千五百萬元。</p>

<h3>澈底革新！開城求援！　—願政府與盟邦重視上海市民的呼籲—</h3>
<p>上海市工商敎育各界代表前天進京，向總統陳述時局意見，表示擁護政府戡亂，希望政治，經濟，外交各方面有所刷新，並訪司徒大使，分電美國大總統及國務卿，呼籲及時加强援華。昨天他們又向蒲立德先生發表詳盡的意見，反對一切與共黨妥協的想法，要求美國朝野認淸現實，全面援華。</p>
<p>滬市人民這一個舉動，是富有意義的。這是民主國家人民積極問政的典型；這是眞正民主基礎的擴大。中樞當局年來常說中國正向民主大道邁進，滬市人民這次行動，就是向民主大道跨進了一步。美國朝野常說，願意帮助一個人民所擁護的中國政府；滬市人民這次行動，就是人民眞正擁護政府戡亂的表現。</p>
<p>上海這個都市，是有百年以上的國際市塲歷史的；上海市的市民，本籍者少而客籍者多，工商輻輳，交通頻繁，它隱然代表着全國的。上海市民的行動，可以影響到全國。許多全國性質的有力團體，大率都以上海為集會之所。全國工業會聯合會，全國商會聯合會，全國銀行公會聯合會，全國錢業公會聯合會，全國總工會，全國律師公會，全國醫師公會，全國會計師公會……等等，它們的領導人物，上海市民幾乎都佔了大部份。所以上海市民一致奮起，認眞來輸財出力，顧問國事，認眞來擁護政府革新，擁護政府戡亂，認眞來協助當局，呼籲外援，我們相信，必可為政府與盟邦所重親，也必能收到不可想像的效果。上海市民，尤其是擁有資力的市民，決不能遇着危難，一跑了事。上海市民早應該如此積極的幹，而今更當再接再厲，不為共匪宣傳攻勢所嚇倒，不為失敗主義的投機份子所謠惑，必須為中國在滿眼荊棘的荒野中開關出一條康莊大道！</p>
<p>我們默察上海市各團體代表這次呼籲陳述的動機，不外兩點：第一是對內：澈底革新我們的政治。第二是對外：開誠尋求美國的援助。如果我們的推測不謬，頤先就此兩點，提供一些眞摯的意見。</p>
<p>我們不能諱言，亦不必諱言，我們的政府是有很多缺點，行政效率很低，官吏貪汚所在多有，尤其是各級政府不明白它自己的權責，因之而責任內閣的制度始終還沒有眞正建立起來。但，這些事，人民有權力而且也能够督促其改革刷新。假使在剿共戰爭中，我們人民袖手旁觀，或相率躱避，則一旦共匪得手，控制全國，吾全民族的自由生活勢必完全喪失，遑論其他。所以，今天在愛好民主自由的人民心目中，很簡單，政府以前措施儘管有令人不滿之處，我們只有用全力去刷新它，改革它，而決不能因此讓共產黨來取而代之。在政府當局，更應該及時自覺，痛切自責，容納人民的意見，接受友邦的忠告，自動自發的來作一番澈底的改革。</p>
<p>政府應該改革些什麽呢？例如：刷新制度，明定權責；簡化機構，裁汰冗員；革除一切官僚衙門公文旅行的腐敗習慣；確實改善軍公敎人員的待遇，厲行作戰和行政的考核與功過的賞罰；改善賦稅制度與糧政役政，達到「有錢出錢，有力出力」的目標；取消一切不合國情的管制約束；改變「與民爭利」的政策，减少不必要的國營事業機構；盡其可能鼓勵民營企業與自由貿易，使民有資本與外國資本樂意在後方各省市投資於生產事業，……這一切的一切，凡是足以增加作戰力量的設施，都應急起直追，有所努力。而尤其重要的，我們要建立起一種對人民負責對總統負責的責任內閣制度，使組織這個責任內閣的行政院院長能在剿匪第一，戡亂第一的大政方針下，負起他完全的責任，放手來總持一切政治經濟的革新，使人民的耳目一新，友邦的觀瞻一改。大局巳經嚴重極了，國脈民命所繫，不容我們官場再作兒戲！像前財長王靈五般自稱「一個不學醫道的醫生來動手術，大開刀」這種　負責任，萬萬不能讓他們糊亂試騐！也萬不能再讓這些瞎負責任的糊塗官還能優游於市朝！我們要求總統物色遺賢，網羅逸士，敦聘實業界的眞實幹才，充實新政府的陣容，而更使一個具有肝膽魄力，絕不投機妥協，深得總統倚畀，並負國際聲望的大員，總持行政，替元首對國民負其政治責任。若眞能這樣組織一個戰時內悶起來，為國家硬挺，相信必可遠勝於目前不死不活的拖延局面，而挽救此千鈞一髮的危機！</p>
<p>其次，我們必須誠懇老實的請求美國及時加强援助。總統的逕電杜魯門總統，蔣夫人的廣播呼籲，都是政府的迫切表示。我們人民也該多方面努力說明中國的險象，亞洲的危機，以促美國朝野的警覺。馬歇爾國務卿回到華府後，巳與杜魯門總統檢討世界大局，首先涉及中國問題，美國輿論也紛紛主張『全力援華」，這一週間將為決定的時期。這一決定，不獨有關中國大局，而且有關於東方大局，實為蘇聯是否能控制世界的關鍵所在。中國的戡亂，實際上誠是反侵略反極權的國際戰爭的前哨戰。我們看到共匪自已獲得了外力的强大支援，却拼命反對美國的援助國民政府，就可明白這個戰爭的性質。美國援華，無異援助自己。不過我們反躬自省，要求美國及時援華，我們自己必須做到五點：（一）肅淸一切投機騎牆的動搖份子，使他們不能在戡亂的戰時政府中作共匪的內應。（二）堅持與民主國家的聯合陣綫，使我們的外交國策更明期，萬不可讓妄想作為中蘇橋樑的跡近「二元外交」政策，貽誤國家的大局。（三）儘可能的說明中國所最需要的軍事援助與經濟援助的性質，項目，與數量，同時保證各種援助獲得最有效的使用。（四）虛心接受美國軍事顧問團的意見與其援助工作，並延攬政治方面財政經濟各部門的外國專家，而接受其改革的建議。（五）開誠布公的提供中國所可貢獻於世界反共陣營的條件是什麽，使民主國家知道中國不是一個只取而無所與的累贅。總之，我們交朋友，求援助，必須坦白，眞誠，彼此肝胆相照，方能患難與共·萬萬不可再想投機取巧，弄玄虛，掉槍花，以致國際間沒有一個眞心的知已之交！</p>

<p>楊耘夫·鄒濟道·繆綬紫·趙伯鈞部份：</p>
<p>查被吿楊紜夫·鄒濟道·有共同圖利，代人辦理煤斤採購證，並由被吿趙伯鈞爲之媒介等情，因上海市政府調查處獲有密報，卽派職員陳志祥偕同唐克鈞化名湯根生喬裝商人與被吿趙伯鈞接洽妥當，於皇后咖啡館款證互交完畢，當被預爲佈局之警員逮捕，搜出採購證與款項屬實，其間經過，已據收案之上海市警察局經濟警察大隊組長王思祖及喬裝商人之唐克鈞及調查處承辦人員樂壯新到庭陳述綦詳，詢據被吿楊紜夫承認徇趙伯鈞之請託，命鄒濟道，以其與毛梅軒合開之公大煤號出面申領採購證屬實，核與被吿趙伯鈞·鄒濟道所供均相脗合，雖辯解意旨，楊紜夫稱不知趙伯鈞有收款情事，趙伯鈞亦稱所收之款，充作保證金云云，第查被吿趙伯鈞所供保證金之意義，謂楊處長（指楊紜夫）對我說，煤到上海要交給公大煤號出售，須給公大煤號百分之二的，我恐陳志祥靠不住，要他舖保，他因找不到，願以現金保證，而詢諸鄒濟道夥開公大煤號毛梅軒稱，僅知有出面爲人代領採購證，而否認有欲拿取佣金及保證金情事，苟非彼此朋分利益，何以代爲辦理一切，是按照當時破案情形，及各該被吿之供詞，並參以調查局接獲情報之情形而觀，被吿楊紜夫·鄒濟道，對於發給採購證，雖非其主管或監督之事務，而有共同利用其燃管會運輸處職員之身份以圖利，及被吿趙伯鈞有重要之帮助行爲，俱堪據而認定。再次查被吿楊紜夫·鄒濟道·繆綬紫對於商人由京運滬之統制煤，依章不能進口，而被吿等有賄於情事，不僅上海市政府調查處有密報調查屬實，卽本院審判時，傳有關之裕大煤號主人潘宗禮，乾記煤號主人盧受臣，華茂煤號主人葛季華等到庭分別證稱，因有煤自水陸運滬，曾有以車馬費及小費等名目或向燃管會科員鄒濟道直接交付，或託張錦記報關行張天才代爲辦理云云。詢據被吿鄒濟道承認無異，卽核諸張天才證稱亦符，又查被吿鄒濟道於本年九月二十三日，在警局供明檢查統制煤不扣留之理由，略稱起先我們曾呈報科長楊紜夫，楊科長不作主張，所以一部份以官價收購，但是以後因煤商均爲熟人，他們願意拿出一些錢來，送給燃管會，請求不收購而爲放行之條件，先是每噸二萬元，後來煤商自願增加到四萬元六萬元，最近每噸十萬元，是我與繆綬紫每天去煤市塲調查煤市價格時，由商人交輿我們的，由我們交與科長楊紜夫，有時由繆交與楊，有時是我交與楊的云云·有警局送案之筆錄繕本可稽，是被吿楊紜夫·鄒濟道·繆綬紫有共同連續對於違背職務之行爲，收受賄賂之事實，亦堪據而認定。雖被吿楊紜夫始終不認有收受此款項情事，並辯稱至統制煤之進口，因滬上煤斤缺乏，經濟部長陳部長來滬時，面諭煤斤並非鴉片可比，不妨通融辦理，然統制煤斤旣爲政府之旣定經濟措施，縱欲變更原案，定有上級主管官署之正式命令。茲該被告旣無確證提出。空言辯解，自難置信。至被吿鄒濟道辯稱，所收純係車資，然核與在警局初供不符，顯見畏罪翻供之詞，不足採信，而被吿繆綬紫於審判時雖根本否認其事，然當警局偵訊時，問其有無分肥情事，則答稱除了零令星車資，其他都沒有，其有收取賄款情事，已屬吐露，况核與上開煤號主人所謂以車資名義之語，正相符合，非翻供所能狡賴？惟查被吿楊紜夫，鄒濟道之背職收受賄賂罪，與上述利用身份圖利罪，速續數行爲而犯同一貪污罪質之罪名，以一罪論。又查被吿趙伯鈞旣爲帮助從犯，自得較正犯之刑减輕之，再查被吿繆綬紫位低情輕，因收入菲薄，冒險出此，尙堪憫恕，亦應酌减其刑。</p>
<p>孫繼策·林克楹部分：</p>
<p>查被吿孫繼策爲燃管會統配處處長，被吿林克楹爲該處業務科科長，對於配售煤斤，係其主管監督之事務，因欲乘機圖利，乃與經營輪船業之汪劍平，馬忠良勾結，對營輪船業者超配煤斤，以黑市拋售，所得利益，四六分拆，又向松江電氣公司蘇州電氣公司勒索，並收受武進電氣公司禮物等情，業據上海市政調查處根據情報調查明確，一部份支票亦已查出有附卷之照片函件可考，雖該汪劍平，馬忠良因案發後畏罪潛逃，查傳無着，無從詰訊然據申江元大申興拖輪局股東沈金富，又元大拖輪局俞關愼，德泰拖輪局程鈺光，元賣拖輪局嚴阿章，韓福南，鴻利拖輪局陸光聲等，均到庭證稱，配煤事均託馬忠良代向燃管會接洽，所得配煤四六分拆，四成由馬忠良拿去，據云送給燃管會云云。協利輪船局主人陳學文設稱：配煤四六拆賬交由朱學明·汪劍平轉交與燃管會，元昌輪船局經理樂孝順證稱所配之煤四六拆賬，交由汪劍平轉交林科長云云，均經結證在案，核與爲各輪船局以黑市拋售超配煤斤之韓承溥在警局及本院所供，亦屬相符，是被吿等與在逃汪劍平·馬忠良勾結，對各輪局超配煤斤圖利之事實，洵屬有據，非空言所能諉卸。次查申湖綫聯合營業處負責人賀稚英與孫繼策，林克楹聯絡，得以多配煤斤，至其聯絡之方法，初則在國際飯店豐澤樓及汪達平家請宴三次，繼則賄送節禮，又因被吿林克楹對於申配煤斤，故意留難，不爲核批，再賄送支票及現款等情，亦據賀稚英於本年九月三十日在警局陳述綦詳，有送案之筆錄繕本可證審判時到庭證稱，亦屬相符，亦非被吿等支吾其詞所能否認。再次查被吿孫繼策。林克楹對松江電氣公司，如何共同藉端勒索，如何收受款項，及對武進電氣公司收受禮物，及被吿孫繼策對蘇州電氣公司如何藉端勒索等情，已據該松江電氣公司經理施堅忍，武進電氣公司職員汪超逸，蘇州電氣公司經理張賽桐到庭指證歷歷，業經結證在卷。按該證人等平日固不相聯絡，與報吿等均與嫌怨，所爲證言如出一辭，不致憑空誣陷，自堪信爲眞實，且核與調查處承辦人員樂壯新到庭報吿調查之經過情形，亦無不符，尤非被吿等空言所能辯飾，是該二被吿犯罪事實，堪資認定。按其所爲或爲藉端勒索，或爲背職收受賄賂，或爲對於主管監督之事務，直接或間接圖利，間有共同之行爲，亦有單獨之意思。惟均基於概括單一之犯意，繼續數行爲而犯同一罪質之罪名，依法以一罪論。惟查被吿林克楹係一業務科長，對於核配煤斤，取決於其上司統配處處長，職位較低，收賄較微，衡情較堪憫恕，依法自得酌减其刑。</p>
<p>戴偉華·徐葆光·任輝·韓承薄部份：</p>
<p>查警局移送書所載被吿戴偉華·徐葆光·任輝，均爲燃管會運輸處之職員，於被吿鄒濟道收受賄賂後，分給賄款，惟查與楊紜夫·鄒濟道之共同貪污行爲，幷無犯意之聯絡，亦無行爲之分擔，自不能以共同貪污論核，其所爲僅犯普通刑法之收受贓物罪，又被吿韓承溥爲上述輪船局將多配之煤斤，以黑市拋售，其情固難原恕，然查與貪污犯幷無直接犯意之連絡，無非構成普通刑法之牙保贓物罪，此均非特種刑事案件範圍之內，非經檢察官偵查起訴，本院不得逕行審判，當認起訴違背程序規定，應諭知不受理之判決（俟本判決確定後，應移送檢察官偵查，以符規定）。</p>
<p>毛梅軒·孫志剛部份：</p>
<p>查被吿毛梅軒與鄒濟道合設公大煤號，由鄒濟道單獨決定，以公大煤號出面，爲人申領煤斤採購證，此固爲毛梅軒所供認，然與鄒濟道是否有犯意之聯絡，查無確切佐證，按其旣無刑事上之責任意思，自不能合負刑事上之罪責。又被告孫志剛爲江浙內河輪船公司之庶務，受該公司協理汪劍平之囑託，令其購買禮物，命茶房前去孫繼策·林克楹處送禮，此固爲其所供認之事實，然其職爲庶務，代辦禮物，本屬分內之事，所購禮物，是否供犯罪之用，卽其在其主觀上有無犯罪之認識，查無證據，足資認定，是亦無責任意思之可言，亦不能令負刑事上之罪責，依法一併諭知無罪。　據　上論結，應依特種刑事案件訴訟條例第一條第一第三條第二項，刑事訴訟法第二百九十一條前段，第二百九十三條第一項第二百九十五條第一款，懲治貪污條例第一條第一項，第二條第四款，第七款，第三條第三款，第十一條，第十六條，刑法第十一條前段，第廿八條，第五十六條前段，第五十九條，第七十三條，第六十四條第二項，第六十五條第二項，第六十六條前段，第二十倏第一二兩項，第三十七條二三兩項，判決如主文。</p>

<p>甲組賽開始，春茂仁餘角逐，實力伯仲，故下塲後，劇戰隨起，仁餘沈鵬舉吳新運頗見活躍，而春茂劉福善何金貴等亦力敵不屈，兩路健兒馳逐，上半結束，仁餘以廿八比廿三佔先。易籃後，再度接戰，仁餘樂嘉洲爲春茂監視，鮮有所展，但春茂終以不及仁餘穩健，無法抬頭，時間完畢，仁餘以四十四比卅八力退春茂。戰績錄下：</p>

<h3>非限額進口貨輸管考慮放寬</h3>
<p>解決國內物資需要</p>
<p>自政府宣佈實施進出口連鎖制後，輸出入管理委負會方面鑒於非限額進口貨所需外匯，已不必再由國家供給，爲解決國內物資缺乏起見，對附表（一）及附表（二）甲貨物輸入審核尺度之放寬，正在考慮中。據聞此項考慮，計包括過去曾准予進口而經暫停輸入者，過去漏列而確爲國內需要，或國內雖有生產而其數量或品質不足實際需要者，與國人設於國外工廠所生產之各項日用必須品及器材戚原料，確爲國內所需要者。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕據輸管會方面表示；進出口聯鎖制實施後，原有之「限額輸入」及「非限額輸入」均照常辦理，以後之限額仍將公佈·另據進出口業人士之意見，認爲新制度實施後，原則上進口歡量全以出口數量爲根據，但目前適値出口之淡月時期，新貨未大量上市，而存貨已吿售完，且出口品之國內價格，較之世界市塲爲高，故出口不暢，在連鎖制之下，進口亦無法增加，故爲求國內之原料物資不致匱乏起見，仍應另行核定一部份進口限額，以資調劑。</p>

<p>廿一支雙馬紗初喊亦小，嗣以供應不多，行情遂見回揚至八千一百元收盤，亦好二百元，隔日期票喊八千三百元，其餘各支組細紗亦都跟秀一二百元至四五百元不一。</p>
<p>棉布市勢盤旋趨軟，客帮續有吐售，本街布商乘高亦賣，門莊實銷雖已轉暢，但紡建配量增加，喊價因此難見振作。十二磅龍頭細布，初喊三百八十元高峰，國花一現，旋以供多求少，北帮止進轉出，價卽回挫。迨近午收，仍爲三百六十五元原盤結束。</p>
<p>四君子元嗶嘰，散多及北帮脫手甚夥，喊三百五十五元收盤，較上日軋小五元。其餘低檔細布，交易不弱，但喊價亦先倘後疲，紡建開配布疋，龍頭申請價比市面低落三四十元左右，申購者寥若晨里。</p>
<h3>現棉沉寂</h3>
<p>規棉市况仍平，交易零星，同業供售稀少，廠方納胃亦淡，交易仍多沉寂，周浦籽花爲二七五元—二九五元。</p>
<h3>外匯移轉證昨交易轉旺</h3>
<p>外匯移轉證交易，昨日巳趨旺盛，價格爲二十五元，成交頗多。賣出者以中國銀行爲數曼鉅，計達美金三十餘萬。此外僑匯移轉證，昨日亦有成交，價格較出口者略高。</p>
<h3>桐油市氣上揚</h3>
<p>出口蔚爲大宗之足度桐油，自新外匯交易辦法公佈後，同時又聞目前國外行情亦趨起色，故頻頻激動人心，賣戶喊價一路疾晋，市氣翱翔不止，迨至收市，因銀根雖鬆，而現鈔籌碼緊歛，漲風始戰，但與隔日相較，軋升甚多，餘如正副各牌西洪及漢口熬洪，一致追隨見秀。</p>
<h3>台糖疲軟</h3>
<p>合糖昨日市况再見軟弱，外埠客帮因運銷不通，北帮吐售不絕，市况軟無生氣，本街近來門銷淸淡，納胃不暢，塲上籌碼充斥，各檔均見疲軟。45號車白糖晨開三七〇元，後卽不支下挫，收市三五〇元了結。中砂組砂聞台糖公司卽將核配，人心頗疲，收市亦各跌五元，十元，其餘均乏秀色。</p>
<h3>人絲配價</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕中信局昨人造絲會議議決，自廿二日至廿七日人絲牌價，意大利人絲一二〇號三級有光，每箱九六六〇元。</p>
<h3>來源仍頗旺盛　食米市况平靜　麵粉食油均見疲軟</h3>
<p>食米市况趨勢平定，昨晨因天氣陰雨，南市初開人心不振，價格賡續退縮，中途以各方銀根拆出不少，散戶動辦頗多，僅由粳上升十元，開四百六十元，早稻升五元，其他各檔薄稻等均無上落。北市各檔維持原價不動，情形與上日相彷。二市到貨，南市塲四千一百十四石，北市塲五千三百三十一石，合共九千四百四十五石，來源增旺。</p>
<p>麵粉以米市續疲，交易轉淸，價賡下游·兵船粉一四二元，較前降五元，老車開一四九元，收市降至一四五元，下瀉九元，其他紅蜂挫一三元，建成降七元。麩皮再疲，福新大包九〇元。</p>
<p>雜糧圈外物價下瀉，亦吿不振，昨市除外銷白芝蔴上升外，其餘均吿下游，歸德白蔴三三五元，漢口白蘇三三〇元，各升三·四十元。漢口乍豆一七〇元，浦東杜豆二一〇元，均疲十元。苞米堅穩，紅糧挫十五元，明光紅糧九〇元。</p>
<p>食油昨市况轉疲，實銷沉寂不堪。江北吉桶生油一〇二〇元，下瀉二〇元，本廠豆油，大有餘開八一〇元，收市瀉至八〇〇元，大統·大昌新·大德新·退至七九〇元，各挫十元，本廠生菜油下跌較劇，大有餘跌至六三〇元，猛退五〇元，熟菜油平穩未動，蔴油較穩與昨市軋平，豆餅交稀，市價回跌，長字餅六五元，較前市下跌四元。</p>

<h3>贛南九縣浮雕</h3>
<p>— 本報記者　劉藻</p>
<p>〔本報南昌廿一日快訊〕贛南地區所轄的縣份，有贛縣·南康·上猶·祟義·大庾。信豐·龍南·虔南·定南等九縣，是與粵北昆連的一塊山地，那兒有舉世聞名的鎢鑛，亦有經常以此山地爲根據的土共，和新建設的縣政基礎。，</p>
<p>教育廳長周邦道，此次奉派赴贛縣參加第四行政區行政會議，並分赴所轄各縣督征催糧，素來被人視爲邊區的三甫危險地區，周氏這次亦冒險地走到了，眞眞的看了看邊遠縣份的地方政治與邊區治安。周氏日昨公畢歸來，與記者暢談贛南觀感。</p>
<p>贛南多山運糧難</p>
<p>江西現階段的要政，是催兵征糧，中央向省府催征的電報，猶如雪片飛來，省府的大員亦就紛紛出巡坐辦，雖然在民意機關集會時，有許多人在高呼要加强地方教育·建設·反對縣政府的教育建設人員去下鄉辦差事，但是，教育廳長來縣坐催，建設廳長來了緊追，……縣長以及縣政府的全班人馬，亦祗好下石階似的一步催一步，一層追一層，現在贛南各縣的新賦，截至十月底止，大庾征獲配額四成强，贛縣。上猶·信豐等縣征獲三成强，南康·龍南·征獲三成弱，崇義·虔南·定南爲征幣縣份，均已起征。現在各縣已分別組織督征團，下鄉督催，可能如限如額掃數征足。</p>
<p>贛南多山，糧食難以自給，山民在今日生活高壓下，能够這樣的踴躍交糧元賦，這正如熊式輝氏上次回來江西說：十足地是「有糧要出糧」的好百姓·但是，糧政上現在却發生了一個困難問題，無法運輸。</p>
<p>贛江雖然發源於贛南，順流到鄱陽，現因時屆冬令，河永低淺，航行不便，更因船隻不够，運費低廉，一般船戶故意逃避，以致影響到糧述，現在的運費，雖然稍加，船戶依然維持不了最低的生活，何况還有一部份的不肖「糧官」，百般的對船戶留難敲詐。</p>
<p>敎育建設基礎好</p>
<p>教育建設在贛南，確是奠下了優良基礎，各縣公學款產，多已淸理，用作學校基金，南康·上猶·崇義·大庾等縣，已舉辦學穀捐，集中保管，統籌分配，這是解決了各縣國民教育的經費問題，所以贛南各縣的國校教師生活安定，服務努力，各級學校校舍亦多新建，尤以信豐縣立中學校舍，規模尤爲宏大，省立中學的校舍，亦莫敢與「信中」媲美。國民學校的數量，已達到「一保一校」的規定標準，學額亦尙充足。國教在贛南，巳建立良好基礎，成績方面，據周氏道次考察所得，以贛縣爲最優。</p>
<p>重要縣道修築中</p>
<p>贛南的建設，在蔣經國主政時，已有相當成就，如各縣縣政府，縣參會，縣大禮堂，縣立中學，衛生院，鄉鎮公所，國民學校，以及必須要的公共塲所，均已次第完成，房舍嶄新。各縣鄉鎭的電話，亦多巳設綫通話，這對於地方治安上是一個莫大的帮助，祗要甲地有匪，乙地的駐軍或是自衛團隊，馬上可以馳援。現在贛南各縣的重要縣道，如贛猶·興贛·贛遂等綫，均在加緊修築，小型農田水利，亦多已着手修理。</p>
<p>修築縣道，是三年前王陸基主贛時的一項主要施政。他當時曾提出：「上半年種田，下半年修路」，但是，我們檢討在過去三年中，江西各縣完成了幾條路，老百姓又墾殖了幾坵荒田，眞叫人心灰。記者上月赴樟樹，參觀漢前遺址時踏樟樹通臨川的一段路，公路上，路面依然崎嶇不平，所有的溝溪橋樑，雖然裝上了木架，搭上了橋而薄得不足以行走的橋板，而橋端的幾担土方，却沒人再管，依然使這段公路與行人無緣。我們從這一段幾吿通車而與人斷緣的公路修建上，亦可看到江西建設事業的一面。</p>
<p>粵贛湘　邊區侵擾</p>
<p>贛南的地方治安，素來被人重視，現在雖然較爲安靖，但是，決不容有所忽視，因爲油山·帽子峯·是所謂「粵贛湘邊區人民解放總隊」的根據地，他們現在擁有人槍近千，有時化零爲整，四出侵擾，或是化整爲零，深藏山谷，整補編訓。</p>
<p>現在，各縣常備自衛隊及民衆自衛隊，均已編組完成，崇義民衆組訓，因副總隊長黄以廉的努力，成績尤著，惟各縣武器陳舊，複雜，自衛力量尙嫌薄弱，尤以大庾·信體·龍南以及三南昆連地帶，不時發生匪警，這是値得注意的「不靖之區」。</p>
<p>無論如何，贛南建設的基石，是比較堅實的，現在剩留着新氣象，雖已沖淡了不少，但是較諸其他地區的土劣霸道，黑流橫行，總算是給人們保持着一點新的印象。</p>

<h3>認清對象</h3>
<p>— 靖文</p>
<p>鄰家的一個女兒日前由她的學校中帶回來一對信，另外還附着一本爲擴充校舍建築金的募捐册。因爲我也看見，就想說幾句話。</p>
<p>信的內容，不用說，正就是這幾天報紙在討論中的各校追收學費問題，不過該校却不說是追收學費，僅稱是「同人生活補助費」，而且還附帶一個條件，如家長能勸募捐款超過學生「態繳」之「同人生活補助費」的，則可免繳此項補助費。</p>
<p>這辦法可說虧他們設想很周到，因爲「同人生活補助費」旣有苦衷，而家長的負担也不能不考慮，同時校舍擴充建築的工作也不能使之中輟，正如原信中所說是「三方兼顧」了。</p>
<p>凡是靠薪水生活的人，對於教職員生活的淸苦，自應同情。尤其是在幣制改革後，教職員們所受物價高漲的打擊，較其他薪水階級有過之無不及。因爲教職員們的薪水通常都在開學前後一次或分兩次付淸。現在最苦如公務員，尙可獲得一倍半的增給，私立學校的教職員却並此亦不可得。一部份教職員也許常時拿了錢就去預購了柴米油鹽，但將這筆並不甚多的錢，而欲打半年的生活預算，事實上是不可能的。何說教師們究不比生意人那麼會打算盤，他們常初也許因爲相信金圓劵，把這筆錢去存在銀行中或放拆息去了，而現在却不够買一担米！</p>
<p>這種實情，一般人都能瞭解。不過對教師們的瞭解，並不就是對學校的同情，這點我們必須分別淸楚。</p>
<p>教育是神聖的，可是上海的許多私立學校却一向就有「學店」之稱。事實上除極了少數例外，也確是如此。旣曰「學店」，則站在「店」的立塲上講，在銀貨兩訖交易而退之後，勢無追收之理。這是商塲中的一般規矩，也就是現社會中所通稱的「契約」關係，是經濟社會安定的基本條件之一。例如有人在兩個月前用廿塊錢向米店中買了一石米，米店老板決不能藉口要補助他們店中同人的生活，在今天米價五百圓一石時向顧客追收四百八十圓的「補助費」。</p>
<p>學校固和一般商店不同，因爲它出售的不是商品而是服務（Service），且是持續性的。可是一般職業者，亦並不能因現在他仍在繼續服務，因而向服務機關追收補助。譬如我們寫稿的人，決不能向出版機關要求追收補助。若說現在職工又可根據生活指數支薪了，而教員則不能，但這已在前面說過，教職員的酬勞是在物價尙相對平定的時期中一次支付了的，而其他薪水階級却不然。</p>
<p>以上云云，決非筆者不同情教職員諸君的生活窘境，不過道個責任却不能令一般家長負担。教職員們應該認淸目標。在私立學校，他們的負責人應該是校董會與校長，在市立學校，應該是政府常局。尤其是私立學校，以「辦學」起家的大有人在，此時他們利用「追收」或「補助」等名目，卽使成功，對於教職員恐仍無甚麼實益，且反損害了教師們的淸譽。試想以慕捐校舍建築費而可抵充生活補助費，豈非刻劃盡了「學店」老板的嘴臉嗎？</p>
<h3>「最堅固的」銀庫</h3>
<p>— 石文</p>
<p>一八〇〇年，倫敦的英吉利銀行剛剛搬到新建的行址後不久，忽然有一個工人求見該行的經理，說他知道城內有一個人能隨意秘密出入該行的銀庫。最初那位經理當然斥爲胡說，但因那個工人言之鑿鑿，倒底也動了疑心，就在當天半夜率領行員，開啓庫門，不想果然裏面坐着一個陌生男子！</p>
<p>銀行經理大驚，就請問他是如何走進來的。那男子却不肯說·後來拿到了一筆四千美元的賞金，才說出他原是一個修溝道的工人，某一夜他發現了一個廢置不用的豎着的溝管，覺得奇怪，就爬了進去，却見裏面有一把梯，再爬上去，却有一扇小門，隨手而開，却就走進了當年號稱爲「全世界最堅固的」英吉利銀行的銀庫！</p>
<h3>糾紛</h3>
<p>— 冀君</p>
<p>我常常覺得在上海這個都市，粗暴橫蠻的人是太多太多了，不知別人亦有同感否。我初到上海時，乍聽到上海人一開口就說「謝謝儂」，「對不起」之類的客氣話時，竟使我覺得這裏眞是禮義之邦。然而自從我在這個都市住下後不久，我就幾乎天天發現吵架打罵的事，有時出外一次，可能發現好幾起的糾紛。隨便考察一下這些糾紛的起因，往往都不是什麼了不得的事故。例如：有一次是，三輸車和脚踏車的相撞，誰也不認錯，相罵相打起來；有一次是，電車在快速度前進時，被前面一部載重的老虎車，阻了路途，司機和賣票就頓足大罵，那邊回了嘴，這邊的人竟跑下去，劈頭劈臉的賞了那邊一頓耳光；有一次是，一部三輸車載了一位客人，到了西寳興路口靑雲路就停下，客人不肯下，說是講定到實昌路口的，其實西寳興路口與寳昌路口相距不過一二十丈，但兩方是爭得面紅耳赤，看樣子要動武；有一次是，買小菜，還價還少了，賣小菜的也破口大罵起來；有一次是，一個客人吃麵，麵價是法幣四千元，那人拿出四百元一張的票子十張，店家嫌小票子不要，也是一塲軒然大波；至於在電車或公共汽車上，因推撞擠壓而引起的糾紛，更是數見不鮮的事了。</p>
<p>關於這樣的事，我自己也經歷過幾次，每次我都是以「弱者」自居，而緩和了事態的嚴重性的。</p>
<p>有一次是：我在等電車，好容易等來了，而且進了車門，忽被後來一隻手用力拖下，回頭一看，不認得，但他把我無理的拖着就走·走了一段路，他發現抓錯人了，連忙鬆了手，我這時眞是怒不可遏，憤恨極了；但是繼而一想，他抓錯了對象，是他的糊塗，我如今再要罵他，打他，或拉他到警察局去，懲戒他一番，有什麼意思呢？這麼一想，我便饒恕了他，不復追究。</p>
<p>再有一次，就發生在今天上午，乘十七路無軌電車，車內並不怎麼擠，我的背上却壓着一個相當肥胖的人，我不舒服，把身子動了一動，他不覺得，我再把背用力挺了一下，想不到他就暴怒了。大呼大喊之外，撼動着整個身子，說要我下車去同他打架。鬧得全車驚恐，大家用好言相勸，他好像得了勢，一發不可收拾的樣子。我當時也只得同他理論幾句，見不可以理喻，也就由他咆哮去，不然，這一塲惡鬥，不知要打幾個回合呢！</p>
<p>類如上述的一些糾紛，都是無謂之至的事，爲什麼大家不心平氣和一點呢？爲什麼不說一聲「對不起」而一語解紛呢？</p>
<p>我發現：當一個人欲有求於別人時，（例如讓路，代遞物件）他就會連連道着「謝謝儂」，「對不起」等語；但當他受了別人一點無意的攪擾時（例如碰一下），他就會鼓起眼睛，至少給人一個怒目疾視；當他攪擾了別人時，他又絕不認錯道歉，反而如臨戰場，準備迎敵。以致糾紛迭起，使社會平添不少混亂的熱鬧。</p>
<p>而廣之，整個人類何嘗有一日的安寗，不是時時刻刻，處處地區在鬧着糾紛嗎？</p>
<h3>行政院諸公於公敎人員待遇調整事吝不決議概賦一詩</h3>
<p>— 施蟄存</p>
<p>臣朔飢欲死，容臺議未安。如何匡廟算？計出溺　冠虎窟謀皮易，王門素米難。一盤乾苜蓿，忍作肉糜看。</p>
<h3>流光</h3>
<p>— 尢墨君</p>
<p>荻花楓葉兩無情，催送流光向去程。大地年年龍戰急，西風夜夜客心驚。人經浩劫故應疲，月到殘宵漸不明。猶是南朝行樂處，何來聲鼓咽笳聲？</p>
<h3>東鱗西爪</h3>
<p>— 咸斯</p>
<p>世界第一艘破冰船（用輸子的）造於一八三七年，爲加拿大的狄拉伐爾河打冰之用。第一艘螺旋推進的破冰船建造於一八六四年，係俄國克隆斯達港與奧朗能堡之間打冰之用。</p>
<p>美國牙科和產科醫師動手術之前，在應用麻醉劑時，常常開放輕柔的音樂唱片，使病人或產婦得到一種精神上的安寗。用得最普通的兩張唱片是：（一）德別西的「月光」，和（二）悲多芬的「月光曲」。</p>
<h3>學</h3>
<p>本報前載東京法庭判決處刑之各戰犯照片中，土肥原之右爲畑俊六，此人亦做過侵華派遣軍德司令，亦做過他們的陸相。當時米內光政爲首相，對「德義日同盟」，不無疑慮，於是陸相辭職，米內內閣垮台。（日本的怪制度，若陸相辭職，軍部又不推薦繼任人物，則內閣卽須改組。）新閣標榜「軸心」，日本便正式捲入世界戰爭的漩渦，以迄於戰敗投降。第三人廣田宏毅，當「二二六」事變時爲岡田內閣之外相，少壯軍人大鬧東京，殺了許多大臣，惟廣田不但無恙，且繼起組閣，可見此人以「斯文一派」之僞裝，實際與少壯派關係密切。他在外相任，曾有所謂對華三原則，又曾說「外交官的字典中無戰字」，乃從「拿破崙字典無難字」套出來的詞令。戰後，盟軍在日發現廣田爲「黑龍會」之重要分子，則今之判處重刑，良有以也。</p>
<p>本報另一條消息，判絞各犯，可能於下月八日（卽十二月八日）執行，如果爲事實，則七年前發動太平洋戰爭在「一二·八」（一九四一年十二月八日），本年各戰犯處刑亦在「一二·八」報應昭彰，足以示儆。而且一九三二年之淞滬戰役，亦由日冠發動，日期亦是「一二八」（一月二十八）。所以在今年年尾的「一二八」，給他們總結算，「天網恢恢，疏而不漏」，豈不信哉！</p>
<h3>記丁初我</h3>
<p>— 錢大成</p>
<p>自「也是園舊藏古今雜劇」於民國二十七年散出，爲鄭西諦以重値購得，歸諸國立圖書館。孫楷第考據其收藏源流，爲作一二十萬言之長文。乃知此書歷經趙琦美錢謙益錢曾李振宜何煜黄丕烈汪士鐘趙宗建收藏，最後由丁初我先生家散出。先生之名，遂大顯於世。然楷第考　先生生平，語焉不詳。予與先生生同里閘，幼年復就讀其所設丁氏小學，爰述其遺事。</p>
<p>初我先生名祖蔭，字芝孫，常熟人。淸諸生。光緒一末倡辦學校，邑中言教育者，必首推之。家有園林之勝，舊曰「　隱」先生爲易名日「初園」，卽其藏書之所也。有樓三楹，日：「緗素」，（楷第「述也是園古今雜劇」一書中，誤爲湘素。）民國元年，任本邑民政長，繼任縣知事，調任吳江縣知事，所至有惠政。著有「一行集」「松陵文牘」。留心鄉邦掌故，刋有「處山　刋」甲乙丙三集，「虞陽說苑」甲乙兩編。大半取材於「鐵琴銅劍樓」藏賽。晚年續修縣志，僅刋藝文志單行太行世。</p>
<p>先生精於自錄板本之學，藏書頗自詭秘，深閉固拒，不以示人。旣自「舊山樓」趙氏購得「古今雜劇」，錄其跋語，投登「北平岡書館月刋」，詭稱：「于海處趙氏舊山樓，見也是園曲，曾關一過，錄其跋語；匆匆歸趙，今不知流落何所？」迨丁丑之亂，其書自其後人蘇州寓所流出，眞相遂大白於世。先生藏汲古關抄本黄　圃校跋本亦至夥，曾以淡生堂抄本與王紀玉先生易毛抄本。</p>
<p>余在蘇州日，曾於書肆得見先生抄校本毛子晋「隱湖倡和集」二卷，（缺下卷）乃自傳廠園假鈔者，後有朱筆手跋云：「汲古所刋自著如隱湖題跋隱湖倡和以介編等，流傳絕　；是本從傳沅叔處假來傳錄。卷首鈴孝章俊明不寐藏印，尙爲長洲金耿庵物。耿庵亦隊湖社中唱和之一人也。是本原缺下卷，姑俟搜訪卷中多別體字，因原本之舊照錄之。丙辰長夏，初我記於海上寓廬」。</p>
<p>先生於民國壬申卒於蘇寓。燕谷老人有詩挽之日：「何事姑蘇去？翻爲覊旅人。臨危無一語，小別卽千春。秘笈舊山物，名園靜圃鄰。遙知瞑目候，定有淚沾巾。」先生歿後，丁氏小學卽停閉。不數年而丁丑亂作，藏書盡散佚。然先生生前名不出江南，歿後以「古今雜劇」一書，其名乃爲世之治簿錄板本之學者爭相考據。死生得失，幸與不幸，誠難言也。然此書得爲國家收藏，可云得所。先生藉此書得以名傳千古，終亦幸已。</p>

<h3>The Suppression War Has Entered a New Phase: National Army Forces from Eastern Henan and Xuzhou Converge; Elite Troops Advance in Two Routes towards Suxian</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Xuzhou, 24th] National Army forces advancing westward from Nianzhuang on the eastern front of Xuzhou converged with the eastward-bound forces at Daxujia this afternoon. The first to shake hands with Commanders Qiu and Li was Chen Zhang, commander of the 25th Army, the main force in the Nianzhuang battle, who was responsible for the northern defense and served as the vanguard in this westward advance.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Xuzhou, 24th] The three corps of Huang, Qiu, and Li on the eastern front have converged, and the National Army's suppression war has entered a new phase. Currently, in addition to clearing out the remnants of bandits in the area north and south of the railway between Nianzhuang and Daxujia, the National Army continues to pursue and attack the main force of the bandit remnants fleeing towards Suining and Shuanggou. The focus of the suppression war has shifted from the eastern front to the southeastern region.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Xuzhou, 24th] The pursuit on the eastern front of the Xuzhou campaign is nearing its end, while the pursuit on the southern route is just beginning. The Xuzhou Suppression Command announced that over 100,000 troops from the bandit Chen's 9th, 10th, 11th, 13th, and New 7th Columns have suffered heavy losses after being relentlessly pursued and severely attacked by the National Army on the eastern front of Xuzhou in recent days. The remnants fled north in panic across the Bulao River on the 23rd, while those who did not cross the Bulao River fled south towards the Sui River. Another part of the bandit Chen's 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th, 6th, and the two Guangdong Columns have launched several fierce attacks on our southern route of Xuzhou in recent days, but all failed, resulting in heavy casualties and demoralization. They are now fleeing southwest towards Suxian, and we are pursuing them fiercely while taking advantage of our victory.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Xuzhou, 24th] The National Army on the eastern front of Xuzhou, with an indomitable spirit, captured Daxujia this time, creating an unprecedented glorious record in the eastern front pursuit war. The bandits, with Daxujia as the center, set up a rectangular阵地 (阵地) with a depth of sixty *huali* from east to west and a frontage of about thirty *huali* from north to south, building fortresses based on villages, seizing mountains as camps, defending every step to the death, and stubbornly resisting at every turn, attempting to prevent our main army from advancing eastward. Commanders Qiu Qingquan and Li Mi of the two corps personally directed their subordinates to bravely attack from the front lines. Division Commander Tan Xin personally led his troops to capture Daxujia, which was fortified with strong reinforced concrete fortifications. His bravery and sacrifice are particularly admirable.

<p>[Our Newspaper, Tangshan, 24th] The general situation in eastern Hebei is like overcast weather, with rumbles of thunder suggesting a bloody storm is approaching. However, after the battle in western Liaoning, the Communist bandits have not recovered their vitality and need to reorganize. In order to reverse the situation and defend North China, both sides are cautious about future engagements and dare not act rashly. Currently, the bandits in Sanhe and Xianghe are being compressed by the National Army and are moving eastward. The bandits entrenched in Wangtian, Fengrun, are only carrying out localized raids.

<p>[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 24th] Tao Xisheng, Secretary-General of the Central Political Council, said in Beiping: The President originally intended for Zhang Yuejun to be the new President of the Executive Yuan, but Zhang wanted to devote more effort to international relations and was unwilling to assume a fixed responsibility. He also believed that it would be difficult for old people to achieve much, and hoped that new candidates would be selected to take charge. The Executive Yuan is currently being led by Vice President Zhang Lisheng, but this situation is unlikely to last long. Regarding the issue of a wartime system, meetings are being held in Nanjing every day to consider it. The actual content probably includes two main points: (1) strengthening administrative efficiency; (2) expanding the government's foundation and enlisting talents from all over the country to strengthen the government's ranks. According to Tao, his trip to the north was mainly to see the situation of several schools and to inspect the newspapers and film agencies under the Central Propaganda Department.

<h3>Salaries for Public School and Government Employees Adjusted This Month; Generally Increased Fivefold Compared to Last Month; Measures Passed by the Executive Yuan Yesterday</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 24th] The Executive Yuan's political meeting on the 24th passed measures to adjust salaries for civil and military government employees and decided to implement them this month. This adjustment is generally more than five times higher than last month. The proportion of increase is even higher for those with lower base salaries. The calculation method is based on the fourth zone as the standard, with 60 yuan as the base for the base salary, 20% for 61 yuan to 300 yuan, and 10% for more than 301 yuan. The sum is then multiplied by five to get the actual *jinyuan* (金圆) amount. Other zones, in addition to the actual distribution according to the fourth zone standard, will be issued with different proportions of additional issuance. The third zone will receive an additional 20% of the actual amount obtained by the fourth zone, the second zone will receive an additional 45%, the first zone will receive an additional 70%, and the special zone (Taiyuan) will receive an additional 150%. Military personnel will be calculated according to the third zone standard. The adjustment案 (案) of increasing one and a half times approved by the Executive Yuan meeting on November 3 will be abolished. The regional zoning and calculation methods are recorded below:</p>
<p>First Zone: Qingdao, Zhangjiakou, Gui Sui, Dihua, Yulin, Shanxi.</p>
<p>Second Zone: Beiping, Tianjin, Guangzhou. Jiuquan, Tangshan, Jimo, Qinhuangdao, Xiamen, Lianyungang, Xinjiang, Rehe, Suiyuan, Chahar.</p>
<p>Third Zone: Nanjing, Shanghai, Wuhan, Lanzhou, Xining, Kangding, Xi'an, Zhenjiang, Hangzhou, Nanchang, Hefei, Changjiang, Fuzhou, Yinchuan, Wuzhou, Guangdong, Shandong, Hebei, Henan, Gansu, Jiangsu, Zhejiang. Hunan, Hubei, Qinghai, Shaanxi, Jiangxi, Anhui, Fujian, Ningxia.</p>
<p>Fourth Zone: Guilin, Kunming, Guiyang, Chengdu. Chongqing. Guangxi. Yunnan. Xikang, Sichuan, Guizhou.</p>
<p>Special Zone: Taiyuan.</p>
<p>Calculation Example: The calculation method for the fourth zone is exemplified as follows: For a Level 1 Senior Appointment with a base salary of 680 yuan, it should be 60 yuan plus 48 yuan plus 38 yuan, and then the sum is multiplied by five to get 730 yuan. For a Level 16 Delegated Appointment with a base salary of 55 yuan, it should be 55 yuan multiplied by five to get 275 yuan. For a Level 1 Senior Appointment in the third zone with a base salary of 680 yuan, it should be 60 yuan plus 48 yuan plus 38 yuan, multiplied by five, and then add 20% to get 876 yuan. For a Level 16 Delegated Appointment with a base salary of 55 yuan, it should be 55 yuan multiplied by five, and then add 20% to get 330 yuan.</p>

<h3>National-Run Transportation Businesses Increase Prices Too Much; Control Yuan Decides to Propose a Rectification; Transportation Becomes a Means of Transportation Exclusively for the Wealthy</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 24th] The Control Yuan has decided to submit a rectification proposal to the Executive Yuan regarding the problem of excessive price increases in national-run transportation businesses. The proposal was approved at the regular meeting of the Transportation Committee of the Yuan at 3:00 PM on the 24th and will be sent out immediately. The reason is: The state sets up transportation agencies to serve the public and facilitate the majority of the people. Now, the fares for aviation and shipping are too expensive, which only turns planes and ships into means of transportation exclusively for the wealthy, while after the government improved management and supplementary measures, the price index this month in Shanghai has risen more than eight times compared to August 19, and seven times eight in Nanjing. However, the shipping fares this month suddenly increased by seventeen and a half times in ten days, and air tickets suddenly increased by nineteen times in one week. The Ministry of Communications actually approved it. This measure is obviously inappropriate. The employees of the various companies and agencies cleverly set up various names and arbitrarily increase allowances and subsidies, which leads to repeated increases in charges but does not make up for the expenses of the business and still requires constant subsidies from the government, which urgently needs to be corrected. "The case was submitted by Supervisors Leng Budong, Sun Shi'an, Ma Yaonan, and Tang Honglie.</p>
<p>The meeting of the Transportation Committee of the Supervisory Yuan today was chaired by Zhang Dinghua, the convener of the committee. In addition to the rectification proposal for the price increase of state-owned enterprises, the following cases were also discussed: (1) The proposal to correct the conflict between the postal personnel management regulations and government laws and regulations was resolved and the Yuan was instructed to correct the responsible agency. (2) Guangdong Chairman Song Ziwen purchased six small airplanes for two people and ordered the counties in Guangdong Province to repair small airfields for inspecting local government affairs. Supervisors Tang Honglie and others believed that this was wasteful and should be stopped. The committee members present elected Tang Honglie, Guo Zhongkui, and E Jingfu to be responsible for drafting the impeachment document.</p>
<h3>Audit System Issues of the China Merchants Bureau and the China Textile Company</h3>
<p>The Executive Yuan Decides to Review and Respond to the Control Yuan</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 24th] The Control Yuan's rectification document on the suspension of the audit system for the China Merchants Bureau and the China Textile Company has been sent to the Executive Yuan. It was raised for discussion at the Executive Yuan's political meeting on the 24th, and it was decided to submit it for review. According to regulations, if the government's capital accounts for more than 50%, a business budget statement should be prepared and submitted to the accounting agency for filing. Based on this fact, the Audit Department can continue to exercise audit rights over the China Merchants Bureau and the China Textile Company. However, for the sake of prudence, the Executive Yuan decided to review it before responding.</p>

He should be given a clear commendation, and his life's achievements should be submitted to the National History Museum to show the utmost intention of cherishing meritorious officials.</p>
<h3>Calling for More and Faster US Aid to China; Gu Weijun Visits Truman; Truman and Marshall Have Important Discussions</h3>
<p>[Our News] Washington, 24th Broadcast: Truman and Marshall discussed the urgent world problems for half an hour, with the China issue being the most urgent. Chinese Ambassador to the United States Gu Weijun will meet with Truman in a few hours. It is expected that Gu will ask Truman to express US support for the Chinese Nationalist Government.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 23rd] Chinese Ambassador to the United States Gu Weijun appealed tonight for the United States to provide more aid to China as quickly as possible to stop the grave threat of communist rule and control. He said that if China were to unfortunately fall under Communist rule, Asia would follow, and the war for freedom, which has a great impact on the United States and other freedom-loving people in the world, would have failed at least halfway. Gu's warning speech was made at the invitation of the 电闻 (电闻) Company, and the newsreel of this speech will be shown in US cinemas. He said that from the Chinese perspective, this kind of American aid can be used effectively. The United States' current assistance to China as quickly as possible is equivalent to maintaining the freedom and democracy that is fully manifested in the American way of life. Gu pointed out that while Europe is currently working to prevent the spread of communism, Asia is suffering severely from communism. Over two million 共匪 (共匪) have now seized the nine northeastern provinces and are attacking various parts of North and Central China. It is also learned that Gu and Chinese military attaché to the United States Pi Zongkan will give a talk on an American television station tomorrow night.</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 24th] It was learned here today that President Chiang's letter to President Truman had hoped that MacArthur would serve as the head of the US military delegation to China to boost morale in the fight against the 共匪 (共匪). At least Chiang had suggested to Truman that China needed a general to help, and this person must have great prestige. However, it is feared that the appointment of MacArthur as the head of the US military delegation to China has not been seriously considered here. In addition, it is also learned that regardless of the final decision on the issue of large-scale aid to China, US foreign aid expenditures in the coming years will undoubtedly reach tens of billions. Two points are clear in the outline that the US authorities are currently seeing: First, if President Truman and Secretary of State Marshall decide that China can still be saved and provide assistance, they will at least ask the new Congress to approve hundreds of millions of dollars. This is just the beginning. Any new aid to China plan must be a long-term plan, and there will be a steady stream of assistance in the future. Second, assuming that all of China falls under Communist rule, whether or not there is American aid, the cost of rebuilding Japan and stabilizing its economy will be even higher. This is because it will be more difficult for Japan to trade with Communist-ruled China at that time. Furthermore, if Communist-ruled China actively opposes Western countries in the Cold War, the United States will have to strengthen its defenses in the Western Pacific, which will also cost a lot. Truman and Marshall must consider these factors when reviewing China policy. Marshall is scheduled to meet with the President again today, the second time in three days. The problem of comprehensive US aid to China to suppress the Communist must also take into account the movements of the Soviet Union. Some authorities believe that this move has the danger of causing an indirect conflict between the United States and the Soviet Union. In addition, the problem of whether Marshall will stay or leave remains to be seen. Marshall is scheduled to hold a press conference at 4:30 AM Shanghai time tomorrow morning, at which time there will be a major announcement.</p>
<h3>Hoffman and Truman Discuss Aid to China Issue</h3>
<p>[US Information Service, Washington, 23rd] Economic Cooperation Administration Administrator Hoffman met with President Truman at the White House this afternoon. Afterwards, he told reporters that he had discussed the issue of 总署 (总署) aid to China with the President, but it was "very brief."</p>
<h3>Suggestions Received by US Government and Congress: Send 10,000 US Troops to China; US National Security Council Held Emergency Meeting to Discuss</h3>
<p>[United Press International, Washington, 23rd] Responsible sources stated today that if the United States decides to increase aid to China to reverse the communist suppression campaign, the number of US military advisory group officers and soldiers stationed in China must increase tenfold from the current 1,000 to about 10,000. Their authority should also be expanded from mere training to guiding and supervising actual combat. The government and Congress have both received such suggestions. The National Security Council held an emergency meeting at the White House today, two days earlier than scheduled, which may have discussed this. However, increasing the number of US military advisory group personnel in China to 10,000 is contingent on President Chiang being able to accept US aid to Greece-style conditions. According to military experts here, if this measure is implemented, it could halt the communist advance within a few months. Strictly from a military perspective, the US military aid plan to China should include: (1) dispatching US officers and soldiers as advisors to the National Army combat corps; (2) organizing a flexible logistics force to facilitate supply and establishing more casualty hospitals; and (3) intensifying propaganda efforts to make the purpose of US aid widely known and boost morale. This initiative would last for several years and require US$5 billion in funding. Economic expenses are not included. This year, US military aid to China is only US$125 million.</p>

<h3>Thorough Reform! Seeking Assistance Openly! - May the Government and Allied Nations Value the Appeals of Shanghai Citizens</h3>
<p>Representatives from Shanghai's industrial, commercial, educational, and other sectors went to the capital the day before yesterday to present their views on the current situation to the President, expressing their support for the government's suppression of the rebellion and hoping for reforms in political, economic, and diplomatic fields. They also visited Ambassador Stuart, telegraphed the US President and Secretary of State, appealing for timely and increased aid to China. Yesterday, they also expressed detailed opinions to Mr. Bullitt, opposing all ideas of compromise with the Communist Party and urging the US government and public to recognize reality and provide comprehensive aid to China.</p>
<p>This action by the people of Shanghai is significant. It is a model of active political participation by the people of a democratic country; it is an expansion of the true foundation of democracy. The central authorities have often said in recent years that China is moving towards the path of democracy, and this action by the people of Shanghai is a step towards that path. The US government and public have often said that they are willing to help a Chinese government supported by the people; this action by the people of Shanghai is a true expression of the people's support for the government's suppression of the rebellion.</p>
<p>Shanghai is a city with over a century of international market history. The citizens of Shanghai consist of few locals and many migrants, with bustling commerce and frequent transportation. It implicitly represents the entire country. The actions of Shanghai citizens can influence the entire country. Many influential national organizations largely use Shanghai as a meeting place. The National Federation of Industries, the National Federation of Chambers of Commerce, the National Bankers' Association, the National Native Bankers' Association, the National Federation of Trade Unions, the National Lawyers' Association, the National Medical Association, the National Accountants' Association, etc., their leaders are mostly from Shanghai. Therefore, we believe that the unanimous rise of Shanghai citizens, earnestly contributing resources and efforts, advising on national affairs, sincerely supporting government reforms, supporting government suppression of rebellion, earnestly assisting the authorities, and appealing for foreign aid, will be valued by the government and allied nations, and will surely achieve unimaginable results. Shanghai citizens, especially those with financial resources, must not simply run away in the face of danger. Shanghai citizens should have been actively involved long ago, and now they should continue their efforts, not be intimidated by the Communist propaganda offensive, not be misled by defeatist opportunists, and must blaze a path of prosperity for China in the wilderness full of thorns!</p>
<p>We silently observe that the motives of the representatives of various groups in Shanghai in this appeal and presentation are nothing more than two points: First, internally: thoroughly reform our politics. Second, externally: sincerely seek US assistance. If our speculation is not wrong, Yixian will offer some sincere opinions on these two points.</p>
<p>We cannot and need not deny that our government has many shortcomings, administrative efficiency is very low, corruption among officials is rampant, and especially, governments at all levels do not understand their own powers and responsibilities, so a responsible cabinet system has never been truly established. However, the people have the right and the ability to supervise its reform and renewal. If, in the war to suppress the communists, our people stand idly by or flee, then once the communists succeed and control the entire country, the free life of our entire nation will inevitably be completely lost, let alone anything else. Therefore, in the eyes of people who love democracy and freedom today, it is very simple: despite the unsatisfactory aspects of the government's previous measures, we can only use all our efforts to reform and renew it, and we must not let the Communist Party take its place as a result. The government authorities should be aware of this in time, deeply reproach themselves, accommodate the opinions of the people, accept the advice of friendly countries, and take the initiative to make thorough reforms.</p>
<p>What should the government reform? For example: renewing systems, clarifying powers and responsibilities; simplifying institutions, reducing redundant personnel; eliminating all corrupt habits of bureaucratic red tape; truly improving the treatment of military, government, and educational personnel, strictly implementing assessments of combat and administration, and rewards and punishments for merits and demerits; improving the tax system and grain and labor policies to achieve the goal of "those with money contribute money, those with strength contribute strength"; abolishing all controls and restrictions that do not conform to national conditions; changing the policy of "competing with the people for profit" and reducing unnecessary state-owned enterprises; and encouraging private enterprises and free trade as much as possible, so that private capital and foreign capital are willing to invest in production enterprises in the rear provinces and cities. All of these things, all measures that can increase combat power, should be urgently pursued and efforts made. Especially important is that we must establish a system of responsible cabinet that is responsible to the people and responsible to the President, so that the Prime Minister of the Executive Yuan, who organizes this responsible cabinet, can assume full responsibility under the major policy guidelines of suppressing bandits first and quelling rebellion first, and boldly hold all political and economic reforms, so that the people's eyes and ears are refreshed and the views of friendly countries are changed. The situation is already extremely serious, and the fate of the country and the people is at stake, so we cannot allow our officials to continue to treat it as a game! We must never let those who claim to be like former Finance Minister Wang Ling-wu, "an untrained doctor performing surgery, a major operation," take irresponsible action and experiment haphazardly! We must not allow these muddle-headed officials who take blind responsibility to still loaf about in the city! We ask the President to seek out worthy talents, recruit reclusive scholars, and appoint true talents from the business community to enrich the ranks of the new government, and even more so to have a senior official with courage and boldness, who will never be speculative or compromising, who is deeply trusted by the President, and who bears international prestige, to hold the executive power and bear political responsibility to the people on behalf of the head of state. If we can truly organize a wartime cabinet in this way, grit our teeth for the country, I believe it will be far better than the current half-dead, dragging situation, and save this crisis at a critical moment!</p>
<p>Secondly, we must sincerely and honestly request the United States to increase its assistance in a timely manner. The President's direct telegram to President Truman and Madame Chiang's broadcast appeal are both urgent expressions from the government. Our people should also make efforts to explain the dangers facing China and the crisis in Asia in order to awaken the US government and public. After returning to Washington, Secretary of State Marshall has reviewed the world situation with President Truman, first involving the China issue. American public opinion has also advocated "full support for China." This week will be a decisive period. This decision is not only related to the overall situation in China, but also to the overall situation in the East. It is the key to whether the Soviet Union can control the world. China's suppression of the rebellion is actually a vanguard battle in the international war against aggression and totalitarianism. We see that the communists themselves have gained strong external support, but desperately oppose American aid to the National Government, which makes it clear the nature of this war. American aid to China is tantamount to aiding itself. However, we must reflect on ourselves. To ask the United States to provide timely assistance to China, we ourselves must do five things: (1) eliminate all speculative, fence-sitting, and wavering elements so that they cannot act as internal agents for the communists in the wartime government suppressing the rebellion; (2) adhere to the united front with democratic countries so that our diplomatic national policy is clearer and we must not allow a "bi-diplomacy" policy that fantasizes about acting as a bridge between China and the Soviet Union to mislead the overall national situation; (3) explain as much as possible the nature, items, and amounts of military and economic aid that China needs most, while ensuring that various aid is used most effectively; (4) humbly accept the opinions of the US military advisory group and its assistance work, and recruit foreign experts in political, financial, and economic departments and accept their reform suggestions; and (5) openly and honestly provide what conditions China can contribute to the world anti-communist camp so that democratic countries know that China is not a burden that only takes and does not give. In short, when we make friends and seek help, we must be frank and sincere, treat each other with mutual honesty, and be able to share weal and woe. We must never think about opportunism, playing tricks, or showing off, so that there is not a single truly sincere confidant in the international community!</p>

<p>Brave soldiers at the front: This battle of Xuzhou is a critical moment for the survival of our nation, and especially relates to the safety of the constitutional government forged with the blood and iron of our party's more than 50 years of revolution.

The merits of this battle of yours will be like the sun and moon shining through the heavens in history, and this victory is like rivers and seas shaping the earth in the overall situation. Our National Comfort Association expresses our deepest respect to our brave soldiers at the front, and at the same time calls on people from all regions, sectors, and groups to donate wages, salaries, daily food, or daily necessities, to contribute to our soldiers at the front, and provide for their hardships. The first group leader and members flew to the front to visit the brave soldiers of each corps, to express our comfort. We gave special attention to the officers and soldiers in the field hospitals. These small gifts are not to be considered rewards, nor are they considered sympathy, but they carry the sincere feelings of the rear for the front, which cannot be estimated with limited materials. The front and rear are of one mind, our brave soldiers have no worries, and devote themselves to killing the enemy, making persistent efforts, seizing the opportunity, assessing the situation, competing with the stubborn enemy for the last five minutes, and expanding the victory, so that our Three People's Principles democratic country, our freedom-loving people of Yan and Huang, will not be fettered by the iron curtain, trampled by the bridle, destroyed by poison stings, or contaminated by mad dogs. Our founding father's spirit is watching over us, and will surely bless our brave soldiers to achieve great success.</p>

<h3>FINAL JUDGMENT ON CLASS A WAR CRIMINALS; MACARTHUR ANNOUNCES UPHOLDING OF ORIGINAL SENTENCES; EXECUTIONS OF TOJO AND OTHERS TO BE CARRIED OUT IN SECRET</h3>
<p>[UNITED PRESS, TOKYO, 24TH] MacArthur issued a judgment revision today on 25 Japanese war criminals, upholding the original sentences of the Far East International Military Tribunal, namely seven to be executed by hanging, sixteen to be sentenced to life imprisonment, and two to be sentenced to imprisonment for a fixed term. MacArthur stated: "There were absolutely no errors in the proceedings of the trial, and I see no need to interfere with the original sentences. I hereby order the commander of the Eighth Army to execute the sentences according to the law." The date of the executions will be announced by Zhu. MacArthur also asked believers of all religions in Japan to pray for peace on the day of the executions and to beseech God to guide humanity away from destruction.

<p>[CENTRAL NEWS AGENCY, TOKYO, 24TH] Lieutenant General Walton Walker, commander of the U.S. Eighth Army, announced this afternoon that he has been ordered by General MacArthur to execute the sentences of the Far East International Military Tribunal on the 25 top Japanese war criminals.

<h3>FULL TEXT OF MACARTHUR'S REVIEW; BELIEVES THE TRIAL PROCESS WAS EXTREMELY FAIR; ASKS THE JAPANESE PEOPLE TO SEEK BLESSINGS FROM HEAVEN</h3>
<p>[ASSOCIATED PRESS, TOKYO, 24TH] The full text of MacArthur's review is as follows: "I have drifted in officialdom, but often encountered unsatisfactory matters. However, what I least wanted to do but had to do was this review of the sentences of the Japanese war criminal defendants by the Far East International Military Tribunal. This epoch-making trial aims to weigh the standards of international morality borne by the leaders of a country. I am foolish and my strength is insufficient, and I dare not presumptuously enumerate and define the universally respected principles in the trial.</p>
<p>Since the beginning of chaos, all living beings have thirsted to solve this problem, but the time to solve it may still await the Yellow River to clear. However, in terms of my duties and the limited powers in this case, based on the principles and procedures planned in detail by the relevant Allied countries, there are no technically important errors or omissions in the trial process that require me to intervene in the judgments. What humans decide can never be without error. However, I deeply know that there is no better way to demonstrate justice and fairness than this trial. Clearly, there must be those who are dissatisfied with this judgment, even the erudite judges who formed the court do not entirely agree. However, the evolution of modern society is not yet complete, so there is no other agency that is more qualified and confident to make this solemn judgment. If we cannot trust the rules and responsible persons of this trial, then the world, no matter how big, has nothing to trust. I specially order the commander of the Eighth Army to execute the judgment of the court. When I issue this order, I pray that Heaven will make good use of this tragic trial to show the good people of the world the uselessness of war and that it is merely mankind's greatest sin and most despicable disaster, and to enlighten all countries in the world to jointly despise war. I am startled by this, and I specially request all people of all colors in Japan to stay at home on the day of execution, or gather in public places of prayer, to seek blessings from Heaven, and to wish the world lasting peace and to avoid the devastation of life."</p>
<h3>DIFFICULT TO ESCAPE GUILT EVEN AFTER ABDICATION; JAPANESE EMPEROR DECIDES TO REMAIN ON THE THRONE</h3>
<p>TOJO AND OTHERS' FATE CAUSED HIM SEVERAL SLEEPLESS NIGHTS</p>
<p>[CENTRAL NEWS AGENCY, TOKYO, 24TH] This morning's newspaper here sold news claiming that Emperor Hirohito, who had been considering abdication due to war responsibility, recently decided to remain on the throne. The newspaper stated that after Tojo and the other 25 war criminals were sentenced, Hirohito suffered several sleepless nights. He finally realized that abdication would not benefit the country. The Yomiuri Shimbun claimed that according to a high-ranking judge, the Japanese Emperor has decided to remain on the throne and dedicate the rest of his years to rebuilding Japan as a peaceful nation. The Japanese Emperor, in view of the growing public opinion against his abdication, ultimately believes that this is the best way to compensate for his responsibility for leading Japan into war and its subsequent defeat.</p>

The six neutral nations have begun to study them in an effort to find a compromise.</p>
<p>[UNITED PRESS, PARIS, 24TH] Regarding the Berlin currency issue, after studying the responses of the United States, Britain, France, and the Soviet Union today, the six neutral nations reportedly still have several questions that need to be asked of the four powers again.

The responses of the four powers are scheduled to be released at 4 PM today (standard time). The British side stated that the responses mainly focus on the principles of Berlin currency management.

<p>[ASSOCIATED PRESS, PARIS, 24TH] The United States condemned the Soviet Union on the 24th for interfering with the government of Berlin under four-power occupation, forcing the Berlin crisis to remain unresolved.

Such actions clearly do not help to resolve the dispute."</p>
<p>[FRENCH NEWS AGENCY, PARIS, 23RD] The French side believes that financial issues are only one of the factors in the Berlin problem. They emphasize the importance of the Berlin city elections on December 5th, which are prohibited in the Soviet occupation zone, so the results of the election may form two city governments. In short, the next development of the Berlin problem currently depends on the attitude of the six neutral nations of the Security Council.</p>

Itagaki Seishiro wrote to his wife, saying: "I have adopted a nickname for myself, and I hope the whole family will remember it after my death.

<h3>Comfort Delegation Departs for Xuzhou Today: Delegation Leader Fang Zhi Issues Statement Calling for Donations, Hoping for New Medicines and Pharmaceutical Donations</h3>
<p>The delegation of representatives from all sectors of this city to comfort the soldiers at the front line is scheduled to depart for Xuzhou by plane this morning. The reporter made a special visit to the delegation leader Fang Zhi yesterday, who gave a detailed account of the situation and issued a statement, saying: "I have been entrusted by all sectors and will fulfill my national duty by accompanying my colleagues on this delegation to the Xuzhou front line to represent all sectors in comforting our brave soldiers suppressing the communist bandits. Today's war against the communist bandits is a war against aggression, and eliminating the communist bandits is the only current task of the Chinese nation. If the communist bandits are not eliminated, China will not be secure; only with victory in suppressing the communist bandits will the masses have hope for survival. Our compatriots in the rear must remain calm and composed during this tense time of suppressing the communist bandits, without being threatened by bandit rumors and without planning for a life of ease and comfort. If China becomes communist, even the United States will not be safe. If Shanghai becomes communist, Taiwan and Hong Kong will not be guaranteed. Therefore, only by working together to contribute money and effort to eliminate the communist bandits can we find our only way out. For this comfort mission to the Xubeng front line, the industrial and commercial sectors and enthusiastic patriots have donated a large number of daily necessities, such as towels, gloves, socks, sanitary shirts, cigarettes, candy, etc., totaling no less than one hundred tons, which our delegation will bring to the front to comfort the soldiers. We are also continuing to expand recruitment. This can be called the supreme glory of the people of Shanghai and is something that the soldiers at the front will be happy and encouraged by. However, the most urgently needed items at the front are various medicines, such as first aid kits, gauze, cotton, penicillin, anti-inflammatory pills, tetanus antitoxin, etc. This large-scale battle will inevitably result in many casualties, and how to ensure their early recovery and return to the front line is currently the most urgent matter. I hope that our colleagues in the new medicine and pharmaceutical industries will make great contributions and donate as much as possible, or purchase some at cost, so that they can be transported to the front line separately. Our delegation is scheduled to depart this morning. If there are any matters in the future, please contact Mr. Xu Mingya and Mr. Chen Baotai directly at the temporary office of the Comfort Association of the Friends of the Military at Zha Pu Road (telephone 40145)."</p>

<h3>Tragedy on Xin Qiao Road: One Word Leads to Two Deaths; Beef Stall Owner Stabs Fellow Tradesman to Death, Commits Suicide by Slitting Throat Out of Fear of Punishment; Main Reason Was Love Triangle</h3>
<p>[Our Report] Zhou Qingbo, a 39-year-old Chaozhou native, ran a beef stall at No. 420 Xin Zha Road, in front of the Xinhua Bank. Several years ago, he became involved with Xu Wanshi, a 44-year-old widow from Huangdu, who lived at No. 4, Renji Lane, No. 433 Xin Zha Road. Her husband had passed away eight years ago, and her daughter had married. Her relationship with Zhou became increasingly intimate, and she rented a small house for him at No. 5, Yongshou Lane, Tangjiawan, Zhao Zhou Road, Nanshi. At the beginning of this month, Zhou began a new relationship, cohabitating with a woman named Wu Chunjuan from the same hometown at the aforementioned location. On the 7th, Xu Wanshi went to Yongshou Lane and found Wu Chunjuan and Zhou together. When she asked Chunjuan, she learned everything. Xu was extremely angry and had a quarrel with Zhou, then left quickly. Afterwards, Zhou, seeing that things had reached this point, expressed his desire to break off relations with her and gave her seven dozen towels and returned two liang of gold jewelry. Zhou's fellow townsman, Yao Ziming, lived at No. 40 Xin Qiao Road. In the past, he had partnered with Zhou to run a chicken and duck blood stall. Three years ago, due to conflicting opinions, the two parted ways, and Yao set up his own stall. On the 21st, Xu encountered Yao Ziming on the road, and they chatted. Yao told her that Zhou's first wife was begging for a living in his hometown and that his two sons had died. Zhou was truly a heartless man. The next day, Zhou met Xu again, and she confronted him with Yao's words, accusing him of being a beast in human clothing. Zhou, harboring resentment, suddenly had the idea of killing Yao. At around 11:30 AM yesterday, he took a beef-cutting knife and ran to Yao's stall on Xin Qiao Road, stabbing Yao in the right waist. Yao fell to the ground with serious injuries. Seeing the major disaster he had caused, Zhou used the knife to slit his own throat, cutting off his esophagus and trachea. He lay dying. The police, having been alerted, rushed to the scene and quickly reported to the Xin Cheng Police Branch. Chief Hao sent officer Weng Yongquan and other officers to the scene. Yao was already dead. The murderer Zhou Qingbo was rushed to Hongren Hospital, but he died fifteen minutes later due to his severe injuries. Afterwards, the officers in charge of the case interrogated relevant witnesses such as Xu Wanshi and Wu Chunjuan. The two corpses were sent to the autopsy center on Changde Road to await examination.</p>

<h3>Silver Shops Unable to Open Today; Price Negotiations Still Pending Further Consultation</h3>
<p>[Our Report] The Silver Shops Association held a board meeting yesterday, but no results were achieved. In addition, as the Currency Administration's public announcement of resumption of business has not yet been received, it is impossible to open for business today. Furthermore, the exchange rate negotiated by the industry and the Bureau of Social Affairs was originally based on the national bank's gold price of 1,000 yuan, plus 60% for labor costs, 40% for operating expenses, and 20% for legal profits. Now, the Currency Administration has rigidly stipulated that labor costs are 50%, so price negotiations are still awaiting consultations with the Currency Administration.</p>

<h3>Six Officials in Fuel Management Committee Embezzlement Case Sentenced to Imprisonment; Indictments Against Dai Weihua and Three Others Not Accepted; Mao Meixuan and Sun Zhigang Declared Not Guilty</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The Shanghai Fuel Management Committee's senior staff embezzlement and corruption case, which had been repeatedly tried by the District Court, was sentenced at 9:30 yesterday morning. The main points were: Yang Yunfu (former Transportation Director of the Fuel Management Committee) and Zou Jidao (clerk of the Fuel Management Committee and coal merchant) were each sentenced to ten years of imprisonment and deprived of civil rights for five years for jointly and continuously accepting bribes for actions that violated their duties. Zhao Bojun (retired military officer) was sentenced to three years of imprisonment and deprived of civil rights for three years for assisting others in committing the crime of using his position to seek benefits in matters under supervision or control. Sun Jice (Director of the Allocation Department of the Fuel Management Committee) was sentenced to twelve years of imprisonment and deprived of civil rights for five years for jointly and continuously extorting money. Lin Keying (Section Chief of the Allocation Department of the Fuel Management Committee) was sentenced to six years of imprisonment and deprived of civil rights for three years for jointly and continuously extorting money. Miao Suizi (clerk of the Fuel Management Committee) was sentenced to five years of imprisonment and deprived of civil rights for three years for jointly and continuously accepting bribes for actions that violated her duties. The indictments against Dai Weihua, Xu Baoguang, Ren Hui (all clerks of the Fuel Management Committee), and Han Chengpu (coal merchant) were not accepted. Mao Meixuan (coal merchant) and Sun Zhigang (general affairs of the Jiangzhe Inland River Shipping Company) were found not guilty. The reasons for the court's verdict (omitting the facts of the crimes) and the legal provisions violated are recorded below:</p>
<p>Yang Yunfu, Zou Jidao, Miao Shouzi, and Zhao Bojun's Section:</p>
<p>It was found that the accused Yang Yunfu and Zou Jidao colluded to seek profits and handle coal purchase certificates for others, and that the accused Zhao Bojun acted as an intermediary. Because the Shanghai Municipal Government Investigation Department received a confidential report, it immediately sent officials Chen Zhixiang and Tang Kejun, using the aliases Tang Gengsheng and posing as merchants, to contact the accused Zhao Bojun. After an agreement was reached at the Queen Cafe, the certificates and money were exchanged, and they were immediately arrested by police officers who had been arranged in advance. The fact that purchase certificates and money were found was confirmed. The details of the process were thoroughly described in court by Wang Sizu, the leader of the Economic Police Brigade of the Shanghai Municipal Police Department, who handled the case, Tang Kejun, who posed as a merchant, and Le Zhuangxin, the investigator from the Investigation Department. According to the interrogation, the accused Yang Yunfu admitted that he had acted on Zhao Bojun's request and ordered Zou Jidao to apply for purchase certificates in the name of the Gongda Coal Company, which he co-owned with Mao Meixuan, which was consistent with the confessions of the accused Zhao Bojun and Zou Jidao. Although Yang Yunfu argued that he was unaware that Zhao Bojun had received money, and Zhao Bojun also claimed that the money received was used as a guarantee deposit, it was found that the accused Zhao Bojun's explanation of the meaning of the guarantee deposit was that Director Yang (referring to Yang Yunfu) told me that the coal delivered to Shanghai had to be sold to Gongda Coal Company, and they needed to give Gongda Coal Company 2%. I was afraid that Chen Zhixiang was unreliable, so I asked him for a guarantee, and because he couldn't find one, he was willing to provide a cash guarantee. However, Mao Meixuan, who co-owned Gongda Coal Company with Zou Jidao, stated that he only knew about applying for purchase certificates for others and denied any intention of taking commission or a guarantee deposit. If they were not sharing the benefits, why would they handle everything for him? Based on the circumstances of the case, the testimonies of the accused, and the information received by the Investigation Bureau, it can be concluded that the accused Yang Yunfu and Zou Jidao jointly used their positions as staff members of the Transportation Department of the Fuel Management Committee to seek benefits in issuing purchase certificates, even though it was not a matter under their direct supervision or control, and that the accused Zhao Bojun provided significant assistance in this activity. These facts can be established with certainty. Furthermore, it was found that the accused Yang Yunfu, Zou Jidao, and Miao Shouzi accepted bribes from merchants regarding controlled coal transported from Beijing to Shanghai, which was not allowed to be imported according to regulations. Not only did the Shanghai Municipal Government Investigation Department receive a confidential report and confirm it, but during the trial, Pan Zongli, the owner of Yuda Coal Company, Lu Shouchen, the owner of Ganji Coal Company, and Ge Jihua, the owner of Huamao Coal Company, testified in court that they had transported coal to Shanghai by land and water and had either directly paid "transportation fees" and "tips" to Zou Jidao, a clerk of the Fuel Management Committee, or entrusted Zhang Tiancai of Zhang Jinji Customs Brokerage to handle it. The accused Zou Jidao admitted to this without exception, which was consistent with Zhang Tiancai's testimony. It was also found that Zou Jidao stated at the police station on September 23 of this year that the reason for not detaining the inspected controlled coal was, "Initially, we reported it to Section Chief Yang Yunfu, but Section Chief Yang did not make a decision. So, some of it was purchased at the official price, but later, because the coal merchants were all acquaintances, they were willing to take out some money to give to the Fuel Management Committee, requesting that they not be purchased and that they be released. At first, it was 20,000 yuan per ton, then the coal merchants voluntarily increased it to 40,000 yuan and 60,000 yuan. Recently, it has been 100,000 yuan per ton. Miao Shouzi and I went to the coal market every day to investigate coal market prices, and the merchants gave it to us. We gave it to Section Chief Yang Yunfu. Sometimes Miao gave it to Yang, and sometimes I gave it to Yang." There are copies of the police station's records available as evidence. The fact that the accused Yang Yunfu, Zou Jidao, and Miao Shouzi jointly and continuously accepted bribes for actions that violated their duties can also be established with certainty. Although the accused Yang Yunfu consistently denied receiving these funds and argued that the import of controlled coal was because there was a shortage of coal in Shanghai, and Minister Chen of the Ministry of Economic Affairs instructed him in person when he came to Shanghai that coal was not comparable to opium and that it would be permissible to handle it flexibly, the controlled coal was already a predetermined economic measure of the government. Even if there was a desire to change the original plan, there must have been a formal order from the superior authority. Since the accused has not presented any solid evidence, his empty words of defense are difficult to believe. As for the accused Zou Jidao's defense that the money received was purely for transportation, it is inconsistent with his initial confession to the police station, which is clearly a confession retracted out of fear of punishment and cannot be accepted. Although the accused Miao Shouzi completely denied the matter during the trial, when the police station interrogated her about whether she had shared the profits, she replied, "Apart from occasional transportation fees, there was nothing else." The fact that she had taken bribes had already been revealed. Moreover, it is consistent with what the owners of the above-mentioned coal companies said about the name of the transportation fee, which cannot be denied by retracting the confession. However, the crimes of dereliction of duty and accepting bribes by the accused Yang Yunfu and Zou Jidao, and the crime of using their position to seek profits, are continuous acts that constitute the same type of corruption crime and should be considered as one crime. Also, since the accused Zhao Bojun was an accomplice, his sentence should be reduced compared to that of the principal offender. Furthermore, the accused Miao Shouzi was in a low position and committed a minor crime. Because of her meager income, she took the risk, which is still somewhat pitiable, and her sentence should also be reduced accordingly.</p>
<p>Sun Jice and Lin Keying's Section:</p>
<p>It was found that the accused Sun Jice was the director of the Allocation Department of the Fuel Management Committee, and the accused Lin Keying was the section chief of the Business Section of the same department. The allocation and sale of coal was a matter under their supervision and control. Because they wanted to take the opportunity to seek profits, they colluded with Wang Jianping and Ma Zhongliang, who were engaged in the shipping business, to over-allocate coal to shipping operators for sale on the black market, and the profits were divided four-six. They also extorted money from Songjiang Electric Company and Suzhou Electric Company and accepted gifts from Wujin Electric Company. The Shanghai Municipal Investigation Department has clarified this through information and investigation, and some checks have also been found with attached photos and letters on file. Although Wang Jianping and Ma Zhongliang fled out of fear of punishment after the case was revealed and could not be found for questioning, Shen Jinfu, a shareholder of Shenjiang Yuanda Shenxing Towboat Bureau, Yu Guanshen of Yuanda Towboat Bureau, Cheng Yuguang of Detai Towboat Bureau, Yan Azhang and Han Funan of Yuanda Towboat Bureau, and Lu Guangsheng of Hongli Towboat Bureau all testified in court that the coal allocation was handled by Ma Zhongliang on their behalf, and the allocated coal was split four-six, with Ma Zhongliang taking 40%, which he said was given to the Fuel Management Committee. Chen Xuewen, the owner of Xieli Shipping Bureau, stated: The coal allocation was split four-six, and the money was handed over to Zhu Xueming and Wang Jianping for delivery to the Fuel Management Committee. Le Xiaoshun, the manager of Yuanchang Shipping Bureau, testified that the allocated coal was split four-six, and the money was handed over to Wang Jianping for delivery to Section Chief Lin. All have been verified and recorded. It also coincides with what Han Chengpu, who sold the over-allocated coal on the black market for various shipping bureaus, confessed to the police station and the court. The fact that the accused colluded with Wang Jianping and Ma Zhongliang, who are on the run, to over-allocate coal to various shipping bureaus for profit is indeed well-founded and cannot be evaded with empty words. Furthermore, He Zhiying, the person in charge of the Shenhu Line Joint Business Office, contacted Sun Jice and Lin Keying to obtain more coal allocation. As for the method of contact, initially, they hosted three banquets at the International Hotel's Fengze Restaurant and Wang Daping's home, and then bribed them with festival gifts. Also, because the accused Lin Keying deliberately made things difficult for the coal allocation applications and did not approve them, they bribed him with checks and cash. He Zhiying also stated this in detail at the police station on September 30 of this year, and there is a copy of the investigation record available for verification. She also testified in court during the trial, which is also consistent and cannot be denied by the accused's evasive words. Furthermore, the details of how the accused Sun Jice and Lin Keying jointly extorted money from Songjiang Electric Company, how they received the funds, and how they received gifts from Wujin Electric Company, and how the accused Sun Jice extorted money from Suzhou Electric Company have all been described in detail by Shi Jianren, the manager of Songjiang Electric Company, Wang Chao Yi, an employee of Wujin Electric Company, and Zhang Saitong, the manager of Suzhou Electric Company, in court, and have been verified and recorded on file. These witnesses do not usually have any connection with each other, and they do not have any grievances with the accused. Their testimonies are consistent, and they are unlikely to make false accusations out of thin air, so they can be believed to be true. Moreover, it is consistent with the report of the investigation process by Le Zhuangxin, an investigator from the Investigation Department, and cannot be refuted by the accused's empty words. The facts of the crimes of the two accused can be established. What they did was either extortion, dereliction of duty and accepting bribes, or directly or indirectly seeking profits in matters under their supervision. Some of the actions were joint, and some were individual. However, they were all based on a single, overarching criminal intent, continuing several acts and committing the same type of crime, which should be considered as one crime according to the law. However, since the accused Lin Keying was only a business section chief, the decision on coal allocation depended on his superior, the director of the Allocation Department. He was in a lower position and received fewer bribes, which is more pitiful and forgiving. His sentence should be reduced accordingly according to the law.</p>
<p>Dai Weihua, Xu Baoguang, Ren Hui, and Han Chengpu's Section:</p>
<p>It was found that the accused Dai Weihua, Xu Baoguang, and Ren Hui, as stated in the police station's transfer document, were all employees of the Transportation Department of the Fuel Management Committee and were given bribes after the accused Zou Jidao accepted the bribes. However, there was no connection of criminal intent or division of action with the joint corruption activities of Yang Yunfu and Zou Jidao. Therefore, they cannot be considered as joint corruption. What they did only constitutes the crime of receiving stolen goods under ordinary criminal law. Also, the accused Han Chengpu sold the over-allocated coal on the black market for the above-mentioned shipping bureaus. His actions are certainly difficult to forgive. However, there was no direct connection of criminal intent with the corruption offenders, and he only constitutes the crime of brokering stolen goods under ordinary criminal law. These are not within the scope of special criminal cases. Without investigation and prosecution by the prosecutor, this court cannot directly try them. It should be recognized that the prosecution violated the procedural regulations, and a judgment of non-acceptance should be announced (after this judgment becomes final, it should be transferred to the prosecutor for investigation in order to comply with the regulations).</p>
<p>Mao Meixuan and Sun Zhigang's Section:</p>
<p>It was found that the accused Mao Meixuan and Zou Jidao jointly established Gongda Coal Company, and Zou Jidao independently decided to use Gongda Coal Company to apply for coal purchase certificates for others. This was admitted by Mao Meixuan, but there is no conclusive evidence to prove whether there was a connection of criminal intent with Zou Jidao. Since he has no criminal responsibility, he cannot be held criminally liable. Also, the accused Sun Zhigang was the general affairs officer of the Jiangzhe Inland River Shipping Company and was instructed by Wang Jianping, the assistant manager of the company, to purchase gifts and order the tea room to send gifts to Sun Jice and Lin Keying. This is a fact admitted by him. However, his position was general affairs, and it was within his duty to purchase gifts on behalf. There is no evidence to prove whether the purchased gifts were used for criminal purposes, that is, whether he subjectively had knowledge of the crime. Therefore, there is also no responsibility to speak of, and he cannot be held criminally liable. According to the law, a verdict of not guilty should be announced together. In summary, it should be based on Article 1 and Article 3, Paragraph 2 of the Special Criminal Cases Litigation Regulations, the first paragraph of Article 291, Article 293, Paragraph 1, and Article 295, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Procedure Law, Article 1, Paragraph 1, Article 2, Paragraph 4 and Paragraph 7, Article 3, Paragraph 3, Article 11, and Article 16 of the Punishment of Corruption Regulations, the first clause of Article 11, Article 28, the first clause of Article 56, Article 59, Article 73, Article 64, Paragraph 2, Article 65, Paragraph 2, and the first clause of Article 66 of the Criminal Law, Article 20, Paragraphs 1 and 2, and Article 37, Paragraphs 2 and 3, and the judgment is as stated in the main text.</p>
<h3>Three Women Prosecuted for Manslaughter After Catching Adultery</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Yan Aibao, Yan Guibao, and Yan Zhu Yuebao were prosecuted by the District Prosecutor's Office yesterday on suspicion of causing death by injury. The reason is that Yan Aibao's husband, Zhu Jinfu, met a woman named Jiang Hongyun in the spring of this year and secretly met her at a hotel. At 8:00 p.m. on the 15th of this month, Zhu again took Jiang Hongyun to Room 529 of the Jinshan Hotel on Hankou Road for a secret rendezvous. The plot was discovered by Yan Aibao, who then invited her sister, Yan Guibao, and her sister-in-law, Yan Zhu Yuebao, to catch the adultery. They ganged up to beat and humiliate Jiang Hongyun. Yan Aibao pushed her to the ground, and Yan Guibao kicked her forcefully in the lower abdomen with her leather shoes, causing serious injuries to Jiang's chest and abdomen. Jiang Hongyun, overcome with pain and shame, took the opportunity to stand up from the ground and ran to the window, escaping without a trace. The police station detained the three women, Yan Aibao, and sent them to the District Prosecutor's Office for investigation and prosecution.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Ding Guitang, Director of the Jianghai Customs Junpu Bureau, Shi Konghuai, Deputy Director, and others reported to Mayor Wu at the Municipal Government at 11:00 a.m. yesterday regarding the excessive demands made by the temporary workers at the Zhanghuabang Shipyard under the bureau, requesting assistance in mediation. It is said that the factory employs 100 long-term workers, whose wages are paid in accordance with the central government's regulations and treatment methods. If there is a real need, temporary workers are hired and paid daily according to the cost-of-living index. Recently, this group of workers suddenly demanded that each person be allocated three dou of rice per month, a one-month loan of wages, and a one-year severance payment upon dismissal, which was rejected by the factory. Work at the entire factory was suspended from the afternoon before yesterday. Mayor Wu has now ordered the Police Department to send officers to maintain order.</p>
<h3>Private Planes Chartered by the Wealthy to Hong Kong, Guangzhou, and Taichung; One Flight Daily</h3>
<p>Recently, the number of wealthy individuals chartering planes to fly to foreign countries and domestic locations such as Taiwan, Guangzhou, Kunming, and Dianqing has gradually increased. According to the China Airlines Company, the government has not issued a clear prohibition on charter flights, so the company continues to accept applications from passengers to charter private planes. However, the fare must include the return trip. Recently, there has been an average of one charter flight per day, with Hong Kong, Guangzhou, and Taiwan being the most common destinations. In order to properly allocate the use of charter planes, the company has entrusted various travel agencies to handle the arrangements.</p>

<p>The Group A game began with Chunmao versus Renyu. Their strengths were similar, so after the game began, a fierce battle ensued.

At the end of the first half, Renyu took the lead with 28-23. After the break, the battle resumed. Renyu's Le Jiaozhou was guarded by Chunmao, and he did not perform much.

Zhang Xianlun's performance was also excellent. Although Police's Gu Zhenji and Zhang Rongzhi were brave, they were still difficult to resist. In the first half, Jianle took the lead with 31-19. After the break, Jianle's players played even more brilliantly, but Police's luck could not be reversed. At the end of the game, Police lost to Jianle 43-62. The results are as follows:</p>

<p>Applications for early redemption of legal tender government bonds will temporarily be paid in Gold Yuan Certificates at the original doubled conversion rate. However, bondholders should properly preserve their application forms. After the revised handling methods are announced, they can use the seal on the original application form and provide a guarantor to claim the additional amount from the original managing bank or bureau.</p>
<h3>Relaxing Restrictions on Imports of Non-Quota Goods Under Consideration</h3>
<p>To Address Domestic Supply Needs</p>
<p>Since the government announced the implementation of the import-export linkage system, the Import and Export Management Committee, considering that the foreign exchange needed for non-quota imports no longer needs to be provided by the state, is considering relaxing the review standards for imports of goods listed in Schedules (1) and (2) A, in order to address the domestic shortage of materials. It is reported that this consideration includes items that were previously approved for import but have been temporarily suspended, items that were previously omitted but are truly needed domestically, items that are produced domestically but whose quantity or quality is insufficient to meet actual needs, and daily necessities, equipment, and raw materials produced by Chinese-owned factories abroad that are truly needed domestically.</p>
<p>[Our Report] According to the Import and Export Management Committee, the existing "quota imports" and "non-quota imports" will continue to be handled as usual after the implementation of the import-export linkage system, and future quotas will be announced. According to import and export industry sources, in principle, the quantity of imports will be based on the quantity of exports under the new system. However, at present, it is the off-season for exports, new goods have not yet entered the market in large quantities, and existing inventory has been sold out. Furthermore, the domestic prices of export goods are higher than those in the world market, resulting in sluggish exports. Under the linkage system, imports cannot be increased either. Therefore, in order to prevent a shortage of raw materials and supplies domestically, it is still necessary to separately approve a portion of the import quota to make adjustments.</p>
<h3>Yarn Market Hovering with Slight Increase; Cotton Cloth Trend Weakening</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the yarn market saw some scattered purchases from client groups due to the easing of credit in the market, and local yarn firms also absorbed some supply. The initial asking price for 42-count Blue Phoenix fine yarn was similar to the previous closing price, but in the middle of the day, there was no intention from various parties to make purchases, and it was once seen to fall by around 1,000 yuan. As the closing time approached, the client groups took action first, and yarn firms followed suit in purchasing, and the asking price finally reached the same level as the previous day, and continued to rise to close at 11,200 yuan, a rebound of 200 yuan from the previous day.</p>
<p>The initial asking price for 21-count Double Horse yarn was also low, but later, due to limited supply, the market saw a rebound to close at 8,100 yuan, also up 200 yuan. The next-day bill was quoted at 8,300 yuan. Other counts of blended fine yarn also followed suit with increases ranging from 100 to 500 yuan.</p>
<p>The cotton cloth market trend hovered and softened. Client groups continued to sell off, and local cloth merchants also sold at high prices. Although retail sales had already improved, the increased allocation of textiles made it difficult for asking prices to rally. The initial asking price for 12-pound Dragon Head fine cloth reached a high of 380 yuan, but after one day, due to abundant supply and weak demand, northern client groups stopped buying and started selling, and the price immediately fell back. Near the noon closing, it remained at the original closing price of 365 yuan.</p>
<p>There were many scattered sales and northern client groups sold off a large quantity of Four Gentlemen Yuan Piji, closing at an asking price of 355 yuan, 5 yuan lower than the previous day. The trading of other lower-end fine cloths was not weak, but asking prices were soft after an initial rise. The application price for textiles allocated by the textile factory was about 30 to 40 yuan lower than the market price, and there were few applicants.</p>
<h3>Raw Cotton Quiet</h3>
<p>The raw cotton market remained flat, with only sporadic transactions. Supply from fellow traders was scarce, and factory purchases were also weak. Trading remained mostly quiet. Zhoupu seed cotton was priced at 275-295 yuan.</p>
<h3>Foreign Exchange Transfer Certificates Trading Active Yesterday</h3>
<p>Trading in foreign exchange transfer certificates became active yesterday, with prices at 25 yuan and a large number of transactions. The Bank of China was the largest seller, accounting for over 300,000 US dollars. In addition, there were also transactions in overseas remittance transfer certificates yesterday, with prices slightly higher than those for export.</p>
<h3>Tung Oil Market Sentiment Rising</h3>
<p>Exported Tung oil is a bulk commodity. Since the announcement of the new foreign exchange transaction methods, and because it was heard that the current international market is also picking up, frequent market agitation has been stirred, and sellers' asking prices have been rising rapidly. The market sentiment has been soaring non-stop. Until the market closing, although credit conditions eased, the availability of cash remained tight, and the rising trend began to slow, but compared to the previous day, the increase was significant. The prices of various grades of Zhengfu, Xihong and Hankou Ao Hong all followed suit.</p>
<h3>Taiwan Sugar Weak</h3>
<p>The sugar market saw further weakness yesterday. Due to transportation difficulties, client groups from other ports kept selling off, and northern client groups sold off continuously. The market was weak and lifeless. Local retail sales have been sluggish recently, and buying sentiment is weak. The market was flooded with supply, and all grades were weak. No. 45 white sugar opened at 370 yuan in the morning, then immediately fell and closed at 350 yuan. It was rumored that the Taiwan Sugar Corporation would soon allocate medium and coarse sugar, making people anxious. These sugars also closed down 5 yuan and 10 yuan respectively. All remaining grades had no outstanding price movements.</p>
<h3>Artificial Silk Allocation Price</h3>
<p>[Our Report] The China Trust Bureau decided at a meeting yesterday that the price for artificial silk from the 22nd to the 27th would be 9,660 yuan per case for Italian artificial silk, grade three, 120 count, with luster.</p>
<h3>Supply Still Quite Strong; Rice Market Calm; Flour and Edible Oil Both Weak</h3>
<p>The rice market trend was stable. The market started slowly yesterday morning due to the cloudy and rainy weather. Prices continued to decline. In the middle of the day, a considerable amount of credit was released from various parties, and retail buyers were very active. Only Japonica rice rose by 10 yuan, opening at 460 yuan. Early rice rose by 5 yuan, and other grades of thin rice remained unchanged. Arrivals in the two markets were: 4,114 piculs in the South Market and 5,331 piculs in the North Market, for a total of 9,445 piculs, an increase in supply.</p>
<p>The flour market weakened further due to the continued weakness of the rice market. Transactions became quieter, and prices continued to decline. Bingchuan flour was 142 yuan, down 5 yuan from the previous day. Lao Che opened at 149 yuan and closed down to 145 yuan, a drop of 9 yuan. Other Red Bee flour dropped by 13 yuan, and Jiancheng flour dropped by 7 yuan. Bran was even weaker, with Fuxin large bags at 90 yuan.</p>
<p>Prices of miscellaneous grains outside the circle also declined and were sluggish. The market prices yesterday fell for all prices except for white sesame for export, which rose. Guide white sesame was 335 yuan, and Hankou white perilla was 330 yuan, each up 30-40 yuan. Hankou Mung bean was 170 yuan, and Pudong Du bean was 210 yuan, each down 10 yuan. Corn was steady, red sorghum was down 15 yuan, and Mingguang red sorghum was 90 yuan.</p>
<p>The edible oil market weakened yesterday, and retail sales were extremely sluggish. Jiangbei Jilong peanut oil was 1,020 yuan, down 20 yuan. This factory's soybean oil, Dayouyu opened at 810 yuan, closing down to 800 yuan. Datong, Dachangxin, and Dade xin all retreated to 790 yuan, each down 10 yuan. This factory's rapeseed oil saw a sharper decline, Dayouyu fell to 630 yuan, a sharp drop of 50 yuan. Cooked rapeseed oil was steady and unchanged. Sesame oil was relatively stable and flat with yesterday's market. Soybean cake trading was scarce, and market prices rebounded, with Changzi cake at 65 yuan, down 4 yuan from the previous market.</p>

<h3>Relief Sculpture of Nine Counties in Southern Jiangxi</h3>
<p>— Our Correspondent Liu Zao</p>
<p>[South Nanchang, 21st Quick News] The counties under the jurisdiction of Southern Jiangxi, including Ganxian, Nankang, Shangyou, Chongyi, Dayu, Xinfeng, Longnan, Qiannan, and Dingnan, are a mountainous area bordering northern Guangdong. There, is the world-renowned tungsten mine, as well as the communist bandits who often use this mountainous area as a base, and the newly constructed county government foundations.</p>
<p>Director of Education Department Zhou Bangdao, was sent to Ganxian to attend the administrative meeting of the Fourth Administrative Region, and went to the counties under his jurisdiction to supervise and urge the collection of grain. Zhou, who has always been regarded as a dangerous area in the border region, also ventured there and truly looked at the local politics and border security of the remote counties. Zhou returned from his official duties a few days ago and talked with reporters about his impressions of Southern Jiangxi.</p>
<p>Difficult to Transport Grain in the Mountainous Southern Jiangxi</p>
<p>The main political task of Jiangxi at this stage is to urge the recruitment of soldiers and the collection of grain. Telegrams from the central government urging the provincial government to collect grain are flying in like snowflakes, and the senior officials of the provincial government are also going on inspection tours. Although many people at the meetings of popular opinion organs are shouting for strengthening local education and construction, and opposing the dispatch of education and construction personnel of the county government to the countryside for errands, the Director of Education comes to the county to supervise, and the Director of Construction comes to closely monitor... The county magistrate and the entire team of the county government have to urge one step at a time and pursue one layer at a time, like stepping down a stone staircase. Currently, as of the end of October, the new taxes of various counties in Southern Jiangxi have been collected as follows: Dayu has collected over 40% of its quota, Ganxian, Shangyou, and Xinfeng have collected over 30%, Nankang and Longnan have collected less than 30%, and Chongyi, Qiannan, and Dingnan are currency-collecting counties, and have all started collecting. Now, the counties have separately organized supervision teams to go to the countryside to supervise and urge, and it is possible that the full amount will be collected as scheduled.</p>
<p>Southern Jiangxi is mostly mountainous, and it is difficult to be self-sufficient in grain. Under today's high-pressure living conditions, the mountain people are able to actively hand over grain and taxes. Just as Xiong Shihui said when he returned to Jiangxi last time: they are truly "good people who will hand over grain if they have grain." However, there is now a difficult problem in grain administration: it is impossible to transport.</p>
<p>Although the Gan River originates in Southern Jiangxi and flows to Poyang, due to the current winter season, the river is shallow and navigation is inconvenient. Moreover, due to insufficient ships and low freight rates, most boatmen deliberately avoid it, which affects the grain transport. Although the current freight rate has been slightly increased, the boatmen still cannot maintain their minimum living standards, not to mention that there are also some unscrupulous "grain officials" who try every means to make things difficult for the boatmen and extort money from them.</p>
<p>Good Foundation for Education and Construction</p>
<p>In Southern Jiangxi, education and construction have indeed laid a good foundation. The public school funds of the counties have mostly been cleared and used as school foundations. Counties such as Nankang, Shangyou, Chongyi, and Dayu have already held school grain donations, which are centrally managed and distributed in a coordinated manner. This has solved the funding problem for national education in the counties. Therefore, the national school teachers in the counties of Southern Jiangxi have stable lives and work hard. Many new school buildings have also been built at all levels, especially the school buildings of Xinfeng County Middle School, which are particularly large in scale. Even the provincial middle school buildings dare not compare with "Xinfeng Middle School." The number of national schools has reached the standard of "one school per Bao," and the number of students is also sufficient. National education has established a good foundation in Southern Jiangxi. According to Zhou's recent inspection, Ganxian is the best in terms of academic performance.</p>
<p>Important County Roads Under Construction</p>
<p>Southern Jiangxi's construction, during the administration of Chiang Ching-kuo, has already achieved considerable success. Such as the county government, county council, county auditorium, county middle school, health centers, township offices, national schools, as well as the necessary public places, have been completed one after another, with brand new houses. The telephone lines in the townships and towns of the counties have also been set up and are communicating, which is a great help to local security. As long as there are bandits in area A, the garrison or self-defense team in area B can immediately come to support. At present, the important county roads in the counties of Southern Jiangxi, such as the Gan-You, Xing-Gan, and Gan-Sui lines, are being built at an accelerated pace. Small-scale farmland water conservancy projects have also been started.</p>
<p>The construction of county roads was a major administrative measure during Wang Luji's administration of Jiangxi three years ago. He once proposed: "Plant fields in the first half of the year, and build roads in the second half of the year." However, when we review the number of roads completed in Jiangxi counties and the number of abandoned fields reclaimed by the people in the past three years, it is truly disheartening. When I went to Zhangshu last month to visit the pre-Han site, I stepped on a section of road from Zhangshu to Linchuan. On the highway, the road surface was still rugged and uneven. Although wooden frames were installed on all the ditches and bridges, and bridge panels were laid that were too thin to walk on, no one cared about the few Dan of earth at the end of the bridge, which still made this section of highway disconnected from pedestrians. From this section of highway, which was almost open to traffic but disconnected from people, we can also see one aspect of Jiangxi's construction industry.</p>
<p>Guangdong-Jiangxi-Hunan Border Area Incursions</p>
<p>The local security in Southern Jiangxi has always been valued. Although it is now relatively peaceful, it must not be neglected, because Youshan and Maozi Peak are the bases of the so-called "Guangdong-Jiangxi-Hunan Border Area People's Liberation General Team." They now have nearly a thousand people with guns, sometimes integrating the scattered forces to raid everywhere, or dispersing the integrated forces to hide deep in the mountains, reorganize, and train.</p>
<p>At present, the standing self-defense teams and the people's self-defense teams of the counties have been formed. The organization and training of the people in Chongyi has been particularly effective due to the efforts of Deputy Commander Huang Yilian. However, the weapons of the counties are old and complex, and the self-defense forces are still weak. Especially in the areas connected to Dayu, Xinti, Longnan, and San Nan, there are occasional bandit alerts. This is a "turbulent area" that deserves attention.</p>
<p>In any case, the cornerstone of Southern Jiangxi's construction is relatively solid. There is now a new atmosphere remaining, although it has been diluted a lot, but compared to the local bullies and gangsters and the rampant black forces in other areas, it can be regarded as maintaining a bit of a new impression for people.</p>
<h3>A Passenger Climbed on Top of a Car at Changshu Bus Station and Died After Falling</h3>
<p>[Our Report from Changshu, 22nd] At the Xihu Company bus station here, at about 1:00 PM on the 21st, before the Shanghai-bound bus departed, a passenger named Xia Atao, from Changjing, Jiangyin, accidentally fell and was injured after climbing on top of the bus. He was unconscious at the time and was immediately sent to the public hospital for treatment by his fellow villagers Zhang Xingzong and Zhang Guisheng, but he eventually died in the evening due to severe concussion and brain rupture.</p>

Also: The collection of field tax in this county started on the 1st of this month. The grain households in the districts and townships have not been able to pay due to the late harvest. The county department has formed a supervision team to divide the districts and go to the countryside day and night to urge the collection of grain, and strive to collect the amount as scheduled within two months.</p>

<h3>In the Sound of Victory at Xuzhou, All Localities Launched a Military Support Movement, "One Person, One Yuan"</h3>
<p>[Our Report from Kunshan, 24th] All sectors here have recently launched a "One Person, One Yuan Military Support Movement," with 100,000 yuan as the standard. The township offices are responsible for soliciting donations, and the deadline for payment is the 15th of next month.</p>
<p>[Our Report from Yixing, 22nd] All sectors have recently launched a campaign to comfort the soldiers at the front: (1) All public and educational personnel in the county donate one day's income. (2) Cooperatives and people's organizations donate towels, thread, and gloves, each unit donating three to five dozens. (3) The Education Bureau promotes a five-corner donation movement among teachers and students in primary and secondary schools throughout the county. The number of donations has been enthusiastic in recent days. In order to seize the opportunity, it was decided to stop accepting donations at the end of this month and send personnel to send them to the front. A victory celebration will be held on the 25th to launch a "One Person, One Yuan" movement for all the people in the county.</p>

<h3>Recognize the Target</h3>
<p>— Jingwen</p>
<p>A daughter of the neighbor brought back a letter from her school the other day, and also attached a donation booklet for expanding the school building fund. Because I also saw it, I wanted to say a few words.</p>
<p>The content of the letter, needless to say, is the issue of schools collecting tuition fees that newspapers have been discussing these days, but the school does not say that it is collecting tuition fees, but only calls it "colleague living subsidy," and also attaches a condition that if parents can solicit donations exceeding the "due payment" of students' "colleague living subsidy," they can be exempted from paying this subsidy.</p>
<p>It can be said that they have thought of a very thorough method, because the "colleague living subsidy" has its own difficulties, and the burden on parents cannot be ignored, and the work of expanding the school building cannot be interrupted, as the original letter said, it is "taking care of all three parties."</p>
<p>Anyone who lives on salary should sympathize with the poor lives of teachers. Especially after the currency reform, the impact of rising prices on teachers is more than that of other salaried classes. Because teachers' salaries are usually paid once or twice before and after the start of school. Now the most difficult are civil servants, who can still get a 1.5 times increase, but private school teachers cannot even get this. Some teachers may have always taken the money to pre-purchase firewood, rice, oil, and salt, but it is impossible to make a half-year living budget with this not very large amount of money. Not to mention that teachers are not as good at calculating as businessmen. They may have initially believed in the Gold Yuan Certificate and deposited the money in the bank or lent it out for interest, but now it is not enough to buy a Dan of rice!</p>
<p>This reality is understood by most people. However, understanding teachers does not mean sympathizing with schools. We must distinguish this clearly.</p>
<p>Education is sacred, but many private schools in Shanghai have always been called "school shops." In fact, with very few exceptions, it is true. Since it is called "school shop," then standing on the position of the "shop," there is no reason to collect money after the transaction is completed. This is the general rule in the business world, which is also the "contract" relationship commonly referred to in today's society, and is one of the basic conditions for the stability of the economic society. For example, if someone bought a Shi of rice from a rice shop two months ago for 20 yuan, the rice shop owner cannot ask the customer to collect 480 yuan of "subsidy" today when the price of rice is 500 yuan a Shi on the grounds of subsidizing the lives of their colleagues in the shop.</p>
<p>Schools are different from ordinary stores, because they sell not goods but services, and they are continuous. However, ordinary professionals cannot ask the service organization to collect subsidies because they are still providing services. For example, we writers cannot ask the publishing organization to request subsidies. If we say that now workers can be paid according to the cost of living index, but teachers cannot, but this has already been said before, teachers' salaries were paid once during a period of relatively stable prices, while other salaried classes are not.</p>
<p>The above is not to say that the author does not sympathize with the difficult living conditions of teachers, but the responsibility cannot be borne by the general parents. Teachers should recognize the target. In private schools, their responsible persons should be the board of directors and the principal. In municipal schools, it should be the government. Especially in private schools, there are many people who started their businesses with "running schools." At this time, if they use names such as "collecting" or "subsidy," even if they succeed, it may still not be of much practical benefit to the teachers, and it will damage the reputation of the teachers. Just imagine that the school building fund can be used to offset the living subsidy, isn't this a complete depiction of the face of the "school shop" owner?</p>
<h3>"The Most Solid" Vault</h3>
<p>— Shi Wen</p>
<p>In 1800, shortly after the Bank of England in London moved to its newly built site, a worker suddenly asked to see the manager of the bank, saying that he knew someone in the city could secretly enter and exit the bank's vault at will. At first, the manager of course dismissed it as nonsense, but because the worker said it with certainty, he became suspicious. That night, he led the bank staff to open the vault door, but unexpectedly there was a strange man sitting inside!</p>
<p>The bank manager was shocked and asked him how he got in. The man refused to say. Later, after receiving a reward of $4,000, he said that he was originally a worker repairing ditches. One night, he found an abandoned vertical ditch pipe and felt strange, so he climbed in, but saw a ladder inside. After climbing up again, there was a small door, which he opened casually, and he walked into the vault of the Bank of England, which was then known as "the most solid in the world!"</p>
<h3>Disputes</h3>
<p>— Ji Jun</p>
<p>I often feel that there are far too many rude and unreasonable people in this city of Shanghai. I wonder if others feel the same way. When I first arrived in Shanghai, I was surprised to hear Shanghainese people say polite things like "Thank you" and "Sorry" as soon as they opened their mouths, and I thought this was truly a land of etiquette. However, not long after I settled down in this city, I found myself witnessing quarrels and scuffles almost every day. Sometimes, just going out once, I might encounter several disputes. Upon casually examining the causes of these disputes, they often turned out to be nothing of great significance. For example: once, a pedicab collided with a bicycle, neither party admitted fault, and they started arguing and fighting; another time, a tram was moving forward at high speed when it was obstructed by a heavily loaded animal-drawn cart in front, the driver and conductor stamped their feet and cursed, and the other side retorted, so the people from the tram actually jumped down and slapped the other side across the face; another time, a pedicab carried a passenger and stopped at the intersection of Xibao Road and Qingyun Road, but the passenger refused to get out, saying that it had been agreed to go to the intersection of Shichang Road. In fact, the distance between the intersection of Xibao Road and Baochang Road was only a few dozen feet, but the two sides argued red in the face and looked like they were about to resort to violence; another time, when buying vegetables, the price was bargained down too much, and the vegetable seller also began to curse loudly; another time, a customer was eating noodles, and the price was 4,000 yuan in legal tender. The person took out ten 400-yuan notes, but the shopkeeper disliked the small denominations and refused to accept them, which also caused a great uproar; as for the disputes caused by pushing and shoving on trams or buses, they are even more common.</p>
<p>I myself have experienced such things several times, and each time I have taken the position of "the weaker party" to ease the severity of the situation.</p>
<p>Once: I was waiting for a tram, and when one finally arrived and I entered the door, I was suddenly pulled down forcefully by a hand from behind. I looked back and didn't recognize the person, but he was dragging me away unreasonably. After walking some distance, he realized he had grabbed the wrong person and quickly let go. At that moment, I was truly furious and resentful. But then I thought, he grabbed the wrong person because of his confusion, what would be the point of scolding him, hitting him, or taking him to the police station to punish him now? Thinking this way, I forgave him and did not pursue the matter further.</p>
<p>Another time happened just this morning. I was riding on trolleybus number 17, and the car wasn't particularly crowded, but a rather obese person was pressing against my back. I felt uncomfortable and moved my body a little, but he didn't notice. I then arched my back forcefully again, but unexpectedly, he became enraged. He shouted and yelled, shaking his whole body, saying that he wanted me to get off the bus and fight him. The whole car was alarmed, and everyone tried to persuade him with kind words, but he seemed to have gained the upper hand and became uncontrollable. At that time, I had no choice but to reason with him for a few words, but seeing that he was unreasonable, I let him rant, otherwise, this fierce fight, I don't know how many rounds it would have lasted!</p>
<p>The disputes mentioned above are all extremely pointless matters. Why can't everyone be a little more calm and peaceful? Why not say "Sorry" and resolve the dispute with a single word?</p>
<p>I have found that when a person wants something from someone else (such as making way or handing something over), they will repeatedly say "Thank you" and "Sorry"; but when they are unintentionally disturbed by someone else (such as being bumped into), they will widen their eyes and at least give the person a glare; when they disturb someone else, they will never admit their mistake or apologize, but instead act as if they are on a battlefield, ready to face the enemy. As a result, disputes arise one after another, adding a lot of chaotic excitement to society.</p>
<p>And broadly speaking, does the entire human race ever have a day of peace? Aren't disputes happening at every moment and in every region?</p>
<h3>An Impromptu Poem on the Executive Yuan Officials' Lack of Decisiveness Regarding the Adjustment of Salaries for Public School Employees</h3>
<p>— Shi Zhecun</p>
<p>Your servant is hungry and about to die, the court's discussion is unsettled. How to assist the emperor's plans? The schemes are like drowning a rat. It's easy to seek skins from tigers' dens, but hard to get plain rice from the king's door. A plate of dry alfalfa, how can it be seen as minced meat?</p>
<h3>Passing Time</h3>
<p>— You Mojun</p>
<p>Reeds and maple leaves are both heartless, urging the fleeting time towards its end. The earth has fierce battles year after year, the west wind startles the traveler's heart night after night. People should be tired after experiencing great calamities, the moon gradually dims when it reaches the end of the night. Still, it is the place where the Southern Dynasties enjoyed themselves, where does the sound of drums and mournful pipes come from?</p>
<h3>Fragments</h3>
<p>— Xian Si</p>
<p>The world's first icebreaker (using a screw) was built in 1837 to break ice on Canada's Delaware River. The first propeller-driven icebreaker was built in 1864 to break ice between the Russian port of Kronstadt and Oranienbaum.</p>
<p>American dental and obstetrical doctors often play soft music records when administering anesthetics before surgery, so that patients or mothers can gain a kind of mental peace. The two most commonly used records are: (1) Debussy's "Clair de Lune", and (2) Beethoven's "Moonlight Sonata".</p>
<h3>Learning</h3>
<p>In the photos of the war criminals sentenced by the Tokyo Court previously published in this newspaper, to the right of Doihara is Hata Shunroku, who also served as commander of the invading China Expeditionary Army and as their Minister of the Army. At that time, Mitsumasa Yonai was the Prime Minister and had doubts about the "German-Italian-Japanese Alliance", so the Minister of the Army resigned, and the Yonai Cabinet collapsed. (Japan's strange system is that if the Minister of the Army resigns and the military does not recommend a successor, then the cabinet must be reorganized.) The new cabinet advocated the "Axis", and Japan formally entered the vortex of World War II, until its defeat and surrender. The third person, Hirota Koki, was the Foreign Minister of the Okada Cabinet during the "February 26th Incident". Young officers rioted in Tokyo and killed many ministers, but Hirota was not only unharmed but also succeeded in forming a cabinet, which shows that this person, with the guise of a "gentle and refined" person, actually had close ties with the young officers. During his tenure as Foreign Minister, he had the so-called Three Principles towards China, and also said that "there is no word 'war' in a diplomat's dictionary", which was a phrase copied from "there is no word 'difficult' in Napoleon's dictionary". After the war, the Allied forces discovered in Japan that Hirota was an important member of the "Black Dragon Society", so the heavy sentence he received today is well-deserved.</p>
<p>Another piece of news from this newspaper is that the execution of the condemned criminals may take place on the 8th of next month (i.e., December 8th). If this is true, then the Pacific War was launched seven years ago on "December 8th" (December 8th, 1941), and the execution of the war criminals this year is also on "December 8th". The retribution is clear, which is enough to serve as a warning. Moreover, the Shanghai War of 1932 was also launched by the Japanese invaders, and the date was also "January 28th" (January 28th). Therefore, giving them a final reckoning on "December 8th" at the end of this year, "the net of heaven is vast, its mesh is wide, yet nothing escapes", is it not believable!</p>
<h3>Remembering Ding Chuwo</h3>
<p>— Qian Dacheng</p>
<p>Ever since the "Old Collection of Ancient and Modern Zaju from Yishiyuan" was dispersed in 1938, it was purchased by Zheng Xidi at a high price and donated to the National Library. Sun Kaidi researched its collection history and wrote a long article of one to two hundred thousand words. It was then learned that this book had been collected by Zhao Qimei, Qian Qianyi, Qian Zeng, Li Zhenyi, He Yu, Huang Pilie, Wang Shizhong, and Zhao Zongjian, and finally dispersed from the home of Mr. Ding Chuwo. Mr. Ding's name then became widely known. However, Kaidi's research on Mr. Ding's life was not detailed. I was from the same village as Mr. Ding and attended the Ding Family Elementary School he founded in my youth, so I will recount his past events.</p>
<p>Mr. Chuwo's name was Zu Yin, his courtesy name was Zhizisun, and he was from Changshu. He was a Qing scholar. At the end of the Guangxu period, he advocated for the establishment of schools, and in the county, anyone who spoke of education would certainly recommend him first. His family had a beautiful garden, formerly called "Luyin". Mr. Ding renamed it "Chuyuan", which was also where he kept his books. There was a three-room building called: "Xiangsu". (Kaidi mistakenly wrote it as "Xiangsu" in his book "On the Ancient and Modern Zaju from Yishiyuan".) In 1912, he served as the head of civil affairs in the county, and later as the magistrate of the county. He was then transferred to the post of magistrate of Wujiang County, where he brought benefits wherever he went. He was the author of "Yixing Collection" and "Songling Documents". He paid attention to local historical anecdotes and published three collections of "Chushan Yikan" A, B, and C, and two editions of "Yuyang Shuoyuan". Most of the material was taken from the collection of "Tieqin Tongjianlou". In his later years, he continued to revise the county chronicles, but only the section on literary and artistic figures was published separately.</p>
<p>Mr. Ding was skilled in the study of autographed block prints, and his book collection was quite secretive, kept tightly closed and refused to be shown to others. After purchasing the "Ancient and Modern Zaju" from the Zhao family's "Jiushanlou", he copied its colophon and submitted it to the "Beiping Library Monthly", falsely claiming: "I saw the Yishiyuan Qu in the old Jiushanlou of the Zhao family at Hai, and once glanced through it, copying its colophon; I hurriedly returned it to the Zhao family, and now I don't know where it has gone." When the Dingchou Rebellion broke out, the book flowed out from his descendants' residence in Suzhou, and the truth was revealed to the world. Mr. Ding also collected a large number of Ji Gu Guan copied manuscripts and Huang Pupu's collated and inscribed manuscripts, and once exchanged a Tanshengtang copied manuscript with Mr. Wang Jiyu for a Mao copied manuscript.</p>
<p>When I was in Suzhou, I once saw in a bookstore Mr. Ding's copied and collated manuscript of Mao Zijin's "Yinhu Changhe Collection" in two volumes (lacking the lower volume), which was a forgery from the Zichuanyuan factory. There was a handwritten inscription in red ink at the end that said: "The works that Ji Gu Guan published by himself, such as Yinhu Inscriptions and Yinhu Changhe, are extremely rare; this edition was copied from the Yuan Shu edition borrowed from Chuan. The Xiaozhang Junming Bumei Collection seal is still on the first volume, which belonged to Jin Gengan of Changzhou. Gengan was also one of the poets in the Hush She. The original volume was missing the lower volume, so I will wait to search for it. There are many variant characters in the volume, so I copied them according to the old original. Summer of Bingchen, recorded by Chuwo in his residence at sea."</p>
<p>Mr. Ding passed away in his residence in Suzhou in the year of Renshen of the Republic. The Old Man of Yan Valley wrote a poem to mourn him, saying: "Why did you go to Gusu? You turned into a traveler. Facing danger without a word, a short separation is like a thousand springs. Secret books from Jiushan, famous gardens neighbor Jingpu. I know that when you close your eyes, there will surely be tears on your kerchief." After Mr. Ding's death, the Ding Family Elementary School was closed. Not many years later, the Dingchou Rebellion broke out, and the collection of books was completely scattered. However, Mr. Ding's name was not known outside of Jiangnan during his lifetime, but after his death, with the book "Ancient and Modern Zaju", his name has become the subject of research by scholars of bibliography and block printing. Gains and losses in life and death, fortune and misfortune, are truly difficult to say. However, this book was able to be collected by the country, which can be said to be the right place for it. Mr. Ding was able to have his name passed down for thousands of years through this book, which is ultimately fortunate.</p>
