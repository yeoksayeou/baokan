<h3>拋股案眞相大白　徐百齊洩漏機密　袁桞安是否共同牟利尙未判明</h3>

<h3>立委經濟專家表示意見　行莊增資實必要　舉出行莊過去顯著劣跡</h3>
<p>〔中央社南京八日電〕關於行莊增資事，立委及財政金融專家多人，一致認爲戰時及戰後之商業行莊，對國家不特毫無貢獻，反而藉此經營黑市，囤積居奇，投機取巧，製造謠言，擾亂市塲及抬高物價，十年來，國民生活之不能安定，皆由於此。渠等主張政府應嚴格取締商業行莊之業務，此次增資之辦法，無論有任何困難，皆應克服，澈底執行。渠等並舉出商業行莊最顯著之劣跡數點：（一）戰時迄今商業銀行數目逐漸增多，但資本總額並未隨物價而增加。（二）商業銀行囤積居奇，買賣金鈔，空頭套利等，遠法經營圖利，其影響於物價，實十倍於通貨膨脹。（三）幣制改革後，商業銀行仍然在作着種種破壞幣制的工作，其中最顯著者，爲各商業銀行所有之外匯黃金白銀並未運照政府之命令，向政府指定之銀行兌換金圓券，在另一方面，因物價之漸趨穩定，渠等不能在漲價中圖利，乃從事大量囤積。據上海方面消息：此次在滬搜查倉庫，發現大量囤積，甚至有在戰勝之初購進者，此種倉庫囤貨之所有者，多爲各商業銀行，直接間接之經營人或以商業銀行爲其靠山者，渠等利用機會與權勢，向政府貸到鉅額款項後，卽用以爲囤積之資本。另須注意者，商業行莊增資辦法中，規定增資之總額應於辦法公佈後三個月內，繳存中央銀行，但此條文之解釋，應爲各商業行莊之增資存於中央銀行後，卽予凍結，絕不能審核後卽發還，因如此，各商業行莊卽無從彼此挪借資本，串通作弊。最近更有不少謠傳，上海及各地行莊，多將大量款項匯至廣州，再事購買黑市港幣，以便將資金逃至香港。此種喪心病狂之行爲，政府更應加以注意，限制各地商業行莊，向廣州匯款，如此則其奸滑之計謀，自無法倖存。</p>
<h3>國際銀行貸款　我可相機洽商</h3>
<p>〔本報南京八日電〕新聞局息：報載我國此次改革幣制將向國際開發銀行貸款六億美元，以爲推定新幣之用，並列舉歐洲諸國如荷蘭·比利時·捷克·南斯拉夫爲例，謂彼等改革幣制時，均會向國際開發銀行貸得款項，按照該行規定，請求貸款係以認　　爲凖，而我國加入該行時，曾認股六億美元各節，頃據財政部息，國際復　開發銀行開業後，我國已依照規定繳付所認股款，原可向該行提出貸款申請，惟刻因國內經濟未臻安定，缺乏貸款條件，致無法作是項申請。現在我國旣已實行幣制改革，經濟可望穩定，自可相機向該行洽商貸款。又該行開業以來，僅辦理四筆貸款，計法國二億五千萬美元，荷蘭一億九千五百萬美元，丹麥四千萬美元，盧森堡一千二百萬美元，均爲協助各該國發展復興建設事業之用。</p>

<h3>私人用戶汽油　今起改定售價　公用事業憑證按舊價購油</h3>

<h3>美蘇重開談判的前提</h3>
<p>美國前任國務卿貝爾納斯六日在西雅圓發表演說，籲請西方盟國與蘇聯重關談判，討論對德問題，俾對德和約商獲一致的協議；他一方面替雅爾達協定辯護，另一方面又勸吿美國人民勿以爲美蘇妥協就是美國對蘇聯的屈服。貝氏相信蘇聯人民决不願有戰爭，所以他說：「蘇聯縱使有再侵略的可能，我們也不能因此而打消和談之一切希望。」貝氏的這一席談話，充滿了企求世界和平的熱忱，凡屬渴望和平的人們，在原則上都是贊成的。但美蘇意見能否經由和談的途徑而獲得一致，却是一個嚴重的問題，所以我們聽了貝氏的談話之後，實有將美蘇關係全盤加以分析的必要。</p>
<p>凡是研究國際問題的人，都認爲第二次大戰後的國際問題，已發生了根本的雙化。現在一般人所謂的「德國問題」，與二年前的「德國問題」，幾已截然不同了·過去是如何解除德國的軍備，如何肅淸德人的納粹思想，如何管制德國使其也成爲和平民主的國家，不再威脅歐洲的和平與安全，英美法與蘇聯的意見，大致是相同的；但是現在德國却成了東方與西方爭奪的對象，大家都想博得德國人民的歡心，企圖利用德國人民爲其反對對方的工具。從西德協定成立之日起，英美法西方盟國所努力的，一是三國佔領區的合併，二是西德實行幣制改革，三是扶持德人召開制憲會議，組成新的民主政府，究其用意，當在阻止蘇聯勢力的侵入西歐。蘇聯看到西方盟國在西德的有計劃行動，不啻芒刺在背，因此也在東德鼓動德國人民的反美情緒，同時並在柏林與農作浪，以抵消西方盟國在西德行動所造成的影響使世人都憂慮柏林的危機足以構成第三次大戰的起點。兩月以來，在這種相激相盪的情勢下，世人無不屏息期待柏林危機的消除·</p>
<p>莫斯科談判雖已盡迂迴曲折的能事，但經過一個月的談話，總算獲得了一個轉機，假如東西雙方都有妥協的誠意，那末在國際間化戾氣爲和祥，非常有希望的·所以世人對於談判的重心，自莫斯科移至柏林，尤其是四國佔領區司令的會談，不僅討論及柏林幣制的統一問題，而且也涉及如何解除蘇聯的對鎖問題，尤其感覺到國際陰霾有一掃而空的希望。無如在四强司令談判的氛圍最融洽的時候，德國共產黨却突然有示威，遊行，暴動的行爲，他們高叫着「反美」的口號，侵入柏林市府大厦，企圖以暴力推翻柏林的民選市府，於是問題又重起波瀾。從表面上看來，德共的行動，似乎不能與蘇聯的態度混為一談，但在實際上，德共舉勸的勸機，决不單輕。本報三日社論曾指出，穗共在柏林的行動，將爲决定四强談判成敗的重要因素·不到幾天，德共果然不出所料，竟將柏林市參議會加以搗毁，而企圖另組共黨市府，再看到蘇聯警察的一味縱容，對於德共的暴行並未加以阻止，則蘇聯的意向如何，固已路人皆知的了。</p>
<p>柏林危機的惡化，不論從那一個角度去觀察，都是不容忽視的。柏林談判旣已停頓，西方三强也將向蘇軍司令柯蒂可夫將軍提出抗議，今後的發展更不可測。英國負責方面對於柏林危樓的惡化表示驚駭，決不是故意驚惶，引起人心的浮　，　因柏林紛擾的意義，確實太嚴重了。所以我們議爲四强談判或美蘇談判，不恢復則已，如欲重開，則其最重要的一個前提，就是雙方的誠意，所謂「精誠所至，石玉爲開」，否則一面進行談判，一面又節外生枝，不論外交家如何努力折衝，總是徒勞無功的。</p>
<h3>爲流亡學生聚衆滋事　孫連仲發表談話　盼學生奉公守法故違者從嚴法辦</h3>
<p>〔本報南京八日電〕首都衛戍總司令孫連仲爲流亡來京學生聚衆滋事，發表談話稱：自共匪擴大叛亂以來，匪區學生抱熱愛國家擁護政府之意志，不甘受匪裏脅，經歷險阻紛紛避難南下輾轉來京，其心志之堅定，遭遇之艱辛，使人深表同情，政府尤爲關籲。到京學生大多均自愛自重遵守法紀，惟仍有少數學生要求逾分行動越軌，竟有聚衆滋事情事發生，如毆打公共汽車賣票司機，無票强入各影劇院觀劇等，迭有所聞。前日復有聚衆搗毁國民大戲院之舉，以致各影劇院感受威脅不敢營業。以上糾紛雖間省因交通及戲院員司言行失當而起，但事後以學生聚衆肇事毆人毁物，致行動後果與起因相違。似此逾法越理之行，殊屬影凡社會秩序。本部職司首都治安，切盼來京學生體念時艱，發揮理智，奉公守法，嚴守秩序，不可自暴自棄，率意行動。其有合理之要求應卽報吿其負責人員或指導員，向有關機關請求，當能盡力解決。今後如有遇與工商各界有所交涉時，可逕報吿所管警察局代爲接洽。遇與軍人交涉時，亦可由憲兵當塲排解或報請本部處理。萬望勿再滋生事端有違法紀，如有故違當以違害社會秩序論罪，從嚴法辦。至各界人士對流亡學生，亦望要寄以同情，多加扶助，俾使團結一致，共赴時艱，是所厚望。</p>
<h3>衛戌總部召開會議　商討流亡學生問題</h3>

<h3>首都娛樂塲所　昨日全體停業</h3>
<p>請願獲保證今復業</p>
<p>〔本報南京八日電〕首都全市娛樂塲所八日採取一致行動，停止營業，市內通衢鬧市及各商塲中人山人海，盛况空前。而平素晚間吐納大量觀衆之電影院，京劇塲及夫子廟之淸唱戲茶廳，則鐵門緊閉，冷落凄凉，並各懸有公吿牌略謂：「本院（廳）爲同業被毁，並慮及顧客安全，現正請願要求保障，故於本日停業一天，諸祈垂察。」按此種情况純係匪區流亡學生連續强行無票觀劇聚衆滋事之結果，唯經首都電影戯劇業同業公會八日晨推派代表赴首都衛戍總司令部，市府及警廳請願後，業巳獲得保證，決於九日在憲警加强保證，維護下重行復業。</p>

<h3>爲平人民團體雷中樞　胡文暉再談七五案　就實際情形與法律觀點表示意見</h3>
<p>〔中央社南京八日電〕監委胡文暉，對平人民團體爲七五事件聯電總統，政院及監察院一事，（一）八日發表談話，再就「七五」事件實際情形與法律觀點，表示意見。據稱：「七五」事件誠然發生於戒嚴以後，報吿書中第一段曾經述及，並非未曾注意。但戒嚴法第三條規定「戰爭或叛亂發生之際，某一地械猶受匪敵之攻圍，或應付非常事變時，該地點海空軍最高司令官，得依本法宣吿臨時戒嚴之。」東北學生於七月五日晨七時許集合，八時至北平市參議會請願，並搗毁其門窗辦公器物，十二時許至李副總毓官邸請願，二時至東交民巷包圍許惠東住宅，五時許二零八師搜索營兩連裝甲車四輛開到佈防，士兵均伏地扣機作戰鬥狀，七時始由在場担任指揮之警局副局長白世維院內吿訴學生代表已經宣佈戒嚴，一切明日再談，並囑趕快回去。迨白等及學生代表出院向西囑學生散去之際而東，西槍聲大作矣。若從戒嚴法上研究，謹可採用非常事變一詞，東北學生因憤激參議會之決議而請願搗毁參議會，包圍許宅是否屬於非常事變，頗堪研究。是日北平除東北學生請願一事外，並無其他足以影響或妨害公共安全跌序之事件發生，由傳總司令不准士兵帶槍一語，足資證明。是戒嚴之舉，專爲東北學生而發。且戒嚴令不發於肇事之始，而發於學生在飢渴疲困行將散去之際。卽退一步言，頒佈戒嚴令亦有一定之法律程序及公吿方式，據白世維所言，戒嚴令係警備部以電話通知者，學生並不知曉，則其戒嚴令並未普遍公吿已屬實。在學生集合請願在戒嚴之時，依法亦不過强迫解散或拘審而已。至謂有不良份子混入乘機鼓動，首先發槍，於學生方面則佈肪軍隊儘可進行搜捕，分別依法懲處，乃竟不分皂白，對龐大之學生羣開槍，以致死傷二十八名之衆，嗣復以種種口實圖卸罪責，實爲痛心。監察委員依憲法所賦予之職權，對於違法失職之官吏，自可本其嚴正之立塲，予以糾彈，絕不瞻徇任何環境執法曲從。本案旣經提出糾舉，在法定期間自應聽候行政院之處理北民人民。團體之意見想亦不過供處理者之參考而己。</p>
<h3>流亡學生毆司機　平電車一度停駛</h3>

<p>〔本報北平八日電〕平市今日上午全部電車停駛，全市交通陷於停頓，至十一時始恢復正常。今晨七時廿分有東北流亡學生二百餘人，由北新橋奔向東四牌樓，追擊電車，毆傷司機。全體電車聞訊後，所有售票司機紛紛向東總部胡同電車工會逃逸，學生後追，秩序大亂。經軍警憲趕到勸說後，始行散去。電車公司今招待記者，報吿被打經過，計自六日起至八日，計被打二七一起。全市車費收入僅及五十餘億，收支不敷甚鉅。今再受此打擊，平市交通前途堪虞。</p>

<h3>法國許曼內閣又夭折　奎伊勒奉命組閣　赫里歐以年老多病力辭</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕倫敦八日廣播巴黎訊：法國七十六歲元老赫里默於八日下三時奉歡禮和召，試行組閣，赫氏當以體弱多病為詞，謝絕組閣。按赫氏曾靜脈炎多時，幾至失聰。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕倫敦八日廣播巴黎訊：歐理和八日召請激進社會黨議會領袖奎伊勒試行組閣。奎氏現年六十四歲，自一九二〇年至一九四〇年間曾任內閣次要職位凡十六次，在此次許曼短命內閣任公共工程部長。李氏當答稱，渠將與各黨領袖會商，是否接受組閣，當於九日中午覆命。</p>
<p>〔合衆社巴黎八日電〕許曼總理因國民議會投不信任票，昨晚已提出辭職。按許曼政府成立僅兩日。歐禮和總統現正考慮延攪法國政界元老赫禮歐出組內閣，以便組成全國聯合政府，而應付戰後最嚴重之政潮。歐氏決定不惜任何代價，以阻止共黨及戴高樂派間之攤牌，蓋此舉不啻為現行中間各黨政權之死刑也。許曼總理因七日社會黨及激進社會黨在國民議會中突然變卦，投不信任票，遂急流勇退，辭職下野。赫禮歐是否因願表示其公忠體國而出任艱巨，頗成疑問。渠年已七十有六，老病多磨，耳又不聰，卽任議長亦常力不從心。如赫氏拒絕出山，歐禮和恐將邀請激進社黨人出組新閣，人選不外前財長梅友或前總理馬利，然希望極少。共黨陶雷士及杜克洛業已再三要求出組政府。</p>
<p>〔合衆社巴黎七日電〕法國社會黨與激進針會黨七日在國民議會對許曼內閣舉行信任表決時，叛離許曼總理，許氏因而辭職。議會以二九五對二八五票不信任許曼內閣，卅入票棄權，於是形成法國在六週內發生第三次政治危機。在表決之後，法老政治家赫里歐卽辭去激進社會黨主席職，赫氏現同時為國民議會議長，赫氏此學顯示該黨之分裂。許曼不顧黨員之勸告，而要求舉行信任表決，并宣佈如告失敗，卽將辭職，因此形成此次危機。許氏原可以無定期延期舉行辮論組閣問題，但渠竟接受挑戰，而以十票之差遂告失敗。為解決政治危機，國民議會或將自行解散而舉行普選。在普選內，中間路綫各政黨極有失敗可能，因而為共黨與戴高樂派爭權戰奠定基礎。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社巴黎七日電〕許為難政府之垮台，係因激進社會黨在最後一分鐘不贊助經濟復興遠大之計劃之故。一般人謂前總理馬利之組織中間黨與同類之混合政府，而拒絕共黨與戴高樂黨之兩極端份子，較有智謀，惟其財長萊諾之財政貨幣計劃，未能獲得多數贊同，遂致失敗。萊諾之計劃分貨幣·生活代價·薪給三部門，萊諾之意，首當穩固幣值，則生活代價自趨穩定。許曼政府之基督敎社會黨財長比諾受工會之歷力，圖先穩固工資，次及物價，最後乃及貨幣，而激進社會黨不予贊同，數亦遭失敗。</p>
<h3>柏林共產黨搗亂行為　美國決嚴予制止　白宮召開特會籌商對策</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕華盛頓八日廣播：馬歇爾今日在記者招待會中樓，共產黨企圖在柏林造成混亂局面，吾人必竭力遏止之。</p>
<p>〔合衆社華感頓八日電〕政府方面對柏林危機之日見惡化，深感關切。國務卿馬歇爾擬於八日中午招待記者，然渠是否願對四强會談打破宮方之況默，則頗成問題。傳柏林會談巳擱淺，然杜魯門總統之決定召集全國保安會議特會，則表示華盛頓對局勢極為鄭重。此間若干外交家認為蘇聯目前如誠欲解決柏林問題，決不致任令過去數日中之暴動發生。雖由於莫斯科會談頗有眉目，四強且決定再度試行解決貨幣及封鎖問題，一般頓表樂觀，然暴動旣接連發生，樂觀心理一落千丈。杜氏之於七日召集特別會議，據測係籌劃談判失敗後之美國政策。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社倫敦七日電〕英外相貝文因柏林緊張之局勢，已臻近乎惡劣之程度，深恐危及四盟國司令現在柏林進行之會商，故已於今晚返抵倫敦。長官各界現公然詆責蘇聯實為柏林紛擾之眞正煽動者。</p>
<h3>蘇空軍演習　威脅柏林空運</h3>
<p>〔合衆社柏林八日電〕蘇聯八日再度舉行大規模空軍演習，威脅柏林之空運。蘇空軍大規模演習之消息，係由蘇方以正式文告通知美空軍司令部，內稱：蘇搬將在柏林上空及三條西方空中走廊內舉行演習，自九月六日開始，須至九月十五日始結束。走廊區內舉行演習低至樹頂，高鐘六千呎，柏林上空則在九千呎至三萬六千呎之間。</p>

<h3>眞理報打破沉寂　痛斥南領袖狄托</h3>
<p>〔合衆社倫敦八日電〕蘇聯報章夏問始終對史達林狄托失和事維持況寂，此風八日突被「眞理報」打破。該報指斥狄托元帥「殘酷歷迫反對其政櫂之大多數南國民衆。」該報堅決否認南方所稱共產情報局正發動對南人及大多數南共之「戰役」，惹吾人認為南人係吾人忠誠之盟友。南共黨員多數仍抱有國際性傳統，而非狄托之國家主義，此係不可否認之事實。又稱：狄托之所以能在位不去者，由於推行「殘暴之恐怖手段以壓迫·集體逮捕·及謀殺對付黨內同志。」</p>
<h3>解除柏林封鎖未獲協議　四總督會議擱淺　西方抗議蘇逮捕德警察</h3>
<p>〔合衆社柏林七日電〕四强駐德軍事總督，即美國克萊，英國羅勃森，法國杜尼格，與蘇聯緊柯洛夫斯基，今日午後四時零四分開始會議，繼續至晚九時五十五分方告結束。會後官方暗示四總督對解除柏林封鎖之細則，未能獲致協議。並稱，會議將不再召開，至少在未獲各本國政府新指令前，將不再舉行</p>
<p>〔合衆社柏林八日電〕西方今日以强硬抗議一份，於八日午後送交蘇方，對七日晚蘇聯背諾逮捕德警十九人事提出抗議。抗議由法軍事總督柯尼格直接送交孫方索柯洛夫斯基，其內容不詳。柏林市參議會八日傍晚在英佔區召開特別會議，目的係抗議蘇方之拘禁德警。孫系新聞社稱六日晚在美聯絡處所捕之德警廿二人，「仍由蘇方不斷審訊中。」</p>
<p>〔合衆社柏林八日電〕柏林市政廳之戰已告結束，孫方又捕去西區德警十九人。此十九名德警原駐市政廳，蘇方乃佯稱准予安全通過，誘之出外。十分鐘後，十九人分乘法軍用卡車，在法軍保護下赴法佔區時，突被蘇軍悉數拘留。</p>
<p>〔合衆社柏林七日電〕蘇方今日解除渠等對市府大廈之包團，柏林之緊張局面已告减輕，蘇方在過去四小時內，曾禁止任何人員通行。蘇方命令孫常備軍警衛隊及德警自市府大廈四周撒退，並允許大壓內之德人離去。</p>

<h3>蘇扣留日俘任軍事營役　麥帥提嚴重抗議　盟管會蘇代表暫取保留態度</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社東京八日電〕麥帥總部對蘇聯當局遣回日本戰俘，朱能按照每月規定人數提出嚴重抗議。據今日麥帥　部發言人透露稱：該項抗誠之函件，係九月三日送交頗管，制日本委員會蘇聯代表　里機揚柯者·據麥帥總部所得　之可靠消息，為蘇聯拘留供其奴役之日俘仍有五十萬人以上·　該發言人稱：蘇聯强迫此輩日人担任軍火工廠，飛機塲　造，及礦塲中之工作，該發言人又說及麥帥總部對於蘇聯在其控制下之區械內，奴役日俘以增加蘇聯軍事潛力極為焦慮。又指出美軍總部一年以前，即向蘇方要求每月經常遺回十六萬人，但蘇代表對於此項要求悍然不顧，未加答覆。據美方最近之估計，在蘇聯拘禁下之日俘，其人數仍有五十二萬三千三百十六人之多。</p>
<p>〔合衆社東京八日電〕蘇聯駐盟方管制日本委員會代表特里維揚柯中將之發言人，八日告合衆社稱：盟總發言人指斥蘇聯奴役五十萬日本俘廳，使服苦役，對於此項批評，特氏暫時不予置評。又稱：在表明熊度前，特氏需時研究該項指責。外交界　為　總發言人之攻勢，使美國在遠東冷虎宣傳攻勢中佔得上風。視察家認為麥帥九月三日致特氏函中，列舉事實及數字以責蘇聯之背約，蘇方對此恐無詞置答。然此間蘇大使館向莫斯科請示後，必有一番反擊。</p>
<h3>南韓保守黨　停止倒閣運動</h3>

<p>〔新亞社漢城八日電〕南韓李內閣因環境特殊，且成立倉促，致招國內外之批許與不滿，此事使李總統頗感困難，如果實行改組或更迭閣僚，則新政府國內威信固然喪失無遺，對國際間之印象亦必不佳，其影響所及對於將在巴黎舉行之聯合國大會與各國承認韓國獨立問題均甚嚴電，李總統為此曾與韓民黨與獨立促成會各鎮導商談妥協問題，最近韓民及獨促兩黨均巳決定自六日起停止倒胞運動，而採取協助的態度，韓民及獨促兩黨之情　改變態度，亦有其不得巳之苦衷，董如南韓之保守勢力再肆內訌，必將趨於圖歸於盡之境地。據觀察家推測，李閣再維持三四個月，或更較長時間，亦非不可能。</p>

<h3>戴銘禮謁經營當局　對報載消息請予澈查　否認聯合各銀行抗令</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕昨日本市某晚報刋載前任財政部錢幣司長戴銘禮「聯絡商葉銀行逃避大量外匯」消息後，本報記者曾分訪徐柏園·林祟墉·戴銘禮三氏，探求眞相。徐次長當時表示，對所傳來滬處理戴銘禮鼓動商行外匯逃避事，全不接頭，此次來滬，除指導商業行莊外匯移存外，別無其他任務。林局長崇墉則謂：此事巳問過蔣督導員，蔣氏謂晋京謁總統非為此事。金管局本身對此亦無所聞。戴銘禮本人則表示：某晚報對本人之記載，共有利用核准設立行莊之職織貧汚，黃金案舞弊，及設法使本市商業銀行外匯資產逃選三點。關於第一點，錢幣司僅為一承轉機稱，最後決定權在上層，行莊之是否核准成立，決非本人之一時喜怒所能決定。至於銀行資本僅一元亦能核准之說，當係指戰前幣值折合金圓券而言，如四明通商兩銀行，戰前之資本各為四百萬，今日折合金圓計算，亦僅為一元三角三分有餘。關於黃金舞弊事，在陪都鬨動一時，平經有關機關調查判決，與渠本人毫無關係。以上兩節，均有卷宗可查。至於攻擊渠聯合滬上商業銀行違抗法令，更無事實根據。目前移存工作正順利進行，徐次長知之最詳。本人僅為銀行界之一員，絕無力量聯合所有銀行反抗政府法令。且歷任公務員有年，何至喪心病狂若此。而所謂積資兩億美元，富可敵國，更為無常識之言。此事見報後，本人即手持該晚報，走誰將經國先生，適因蔣氏開會未晤，隨即分謁央行俞總裁，財部徐次長及金管局林局長，請求澈查。本人現靜待此事之演變，暫不採取行動。聞蔣督導員對此頗為注意，亦正查詢中。</p>

<h3>汾陽路家庭大血案　病夫逞凶死傷五人　柳志雄當場被逮捕　其母供述三點起因</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕汾陽路六十四弄（卽畢勛坊）六號，本市華企進出口行主人柳蔭塘家中，於昨晨八時四十五分許，發生家庭兇殺巨案，死傷計有五人，兇手柳志雄當塲就逮，斯案內容複雜，茲探誌於后：</p>
<p>四川路南京路華企進出口行主人柳蔭壙，廣東中山縣人現年卅八歲，稅居汾陽路畢勛坊六號，其父柳亦佳，年逾古稀，母李氏，六十一歲，妻柳簫　如，育有子女數人，一家七八人，怡怡如也。蔭塘有堂叔柳雨　，又名汝祥，敵僞時期，任偽中央儲備銀行業務局長。柳在年青時，賴其叔爾　之提携，事業蓬勃，家這小康，而雨　有子志雄，又名果汗，年廿七歲，自幼溺愛異常，揮霍成性，曾肄業大同大學，嗣患肺疾，在家休養。</p>
<p>柳雨齋在敵偽時，利用職務，積資殊豐，并置有房產多處。勝利後柳因漢奸案，被捕移送高院，判刑十五年，大部份不動產，均被沒收。嗣後柳之續茲柳鄭頴柔，卽偕十志雄等一家七八人，移居安和寺路一三九號，日常開支，端賴其姪柳蔭塘支持，而志雄患有肺病，曾留住中山醫院療養數月，經醫師施用手術，抽去肋骨四根後，始告痊愈，但身體猶秦復原，一切醫藥費用，均油堂兄蔭塘負坦。</p>
<p>柳志雄出院從商，不幸時運不濟，連年　沛，致儷台高築，時向蔭塘告貸，未能如願，快快怨望。又從傳聞所得，獲悉其父在被捕前，曾有黃金百條，寄藏蔭塘處，屢索不還，因此懷恨，頓起殺念。昨晨八時四十五分許，志雄暗藏手榴彈及美軍用刀各一，至汾陽路畢勛坊六號後門預伏，未幾蔭塘由後門外出，赴行辦公，即趨步上前，拉住西裝，並云；『身畔藏有手榴彈，一同進去講話」，語甫畢，即袖出手榴彈，時蔭塘之妻柳蕭委如，聞聲外視，瞥見克雄正擬强拖蔭塘跨進後門，急起攔阻，被志雄用力推仆倒地。</p>
<p>柳蔭塘見有機可乘，即拔步飛逸，孰知志雄竟舉手榴彈投擲，轟然一響，彈片紛飛，當時適有送麵包之吳承生，鼻部被炸去，柳及妻則幸免於難。至此兇手不顧一切，竟直登三樓，瞥見柳母李氏，懷抱孫女柳南瓊（綫二歲），即取出美軍用刀，直刺氏之前胸，貫穿後背，倒地身死，女孩亦刀傷頭部，回至二樓，見柳父亦佳正在如則，亦舉刀猛戮其左腹部一刀，兇手見肇巨禍，畏罪亦自戳左腹一刀，右足部並被彈片炸傷，至是遂不支而踣。</p>
<p>常熟區警分局據報後，正副分局長嚴澄生，嚴祥鵠，親率刑事股長任公琴，巡官趙玉麟，黃羽軍等馳往現塲，繼有警備部第三大隊長夏濂，親率分隊長閻錦文等，亦聞訊趕到，亟召救護車將受傷者併送紅十字會醫院施治，死者柳李氏之屍體，則車送同仁輔元堂轉入騐屍所待騐，兇手逕送警察習院。該分局後傳兇手之後母柳鄭頴柔到案，據供：志雄之殺機原因有三：（一）患肺病三期，曾托柳父亦佳轉知蔭塘，要求補助大量資金，為其療治不遂，（二）志雄送入中山醫院療養後，堅欲住頭等房，蔭塘不允，數月後遂即出院，（三）志雄曾有一次告貸法幣五億元，結果僅得二億元，（二）肇此慘絕人衰之家庭悲劇云。</p>

<h3>萍煤的壯麗遠景</h3>
<p>— 本報記者　劉藻</p>
<p>今後的萍煤，在三年內，可能究成電汽與機械化，預計每天的煤　量，可達四千噸，各土井亦可產煤一干噸，運輸方面，每日則需五千噸的運煤火車一〇〇輛，成為全中國最新式而產量最大的一個煤礦。所以今後的萍煤，是有一個偉大而美　的遠景。</p>
<p>收買士井　整頓修理</p>
<p>〔本報南昌五日航訊〕戰後復興中的　謀現在僅僅是今後遠景的開端，因為安源方面，在戰時鑛區淪人敵手，土人乘機開　土井，直至戰後復興贛西煤鑛局成立時，土井已達百餘所。此種土井，雖然表面上看來，都由貧苦的人們憑着自己的氣力去煤窟裏討生活，但是，土井鑛工的後面，仍然有惡勢力在撑腰，這種土井，對於日後有計劃有系統的大規模開採，影響殊大。鑛局方面，幾經與土井商治的結果，訂立合同，但是，事實依然不能完全憑着合約去履行，所以鑛局現已組設安源鑛廠臨時工程處，以管理並協助土弁開採，同時並收買較大的土井四處，從事修理整頓，準備從事開採。</p>
<p>土法開採　三人一噸</p>
<p>高坑鑛廠，於戰後伐興時，先就舊有土井整理出煤，計有一分井，三分井，及王家源的四·五分井，總產盆現在每日僅數十噸，三分井為較大的平峒，計長一百八十公尺，敷設雙軌鐵道，以利運輸。屹內有四十五度的斜坡，直達大槽煤廥，頂板斜井內，裝有電動提煤斗，井底的煤，經提煤斗而至平峒裝入鑛車，然後以人力推出平峒沿輕便鐵道下行一點八公里而達白馬廟煤廠，再經煤槽卸入煤車，由浙贛路的泉高支綫，轉運泉江堰額站，西上株州，東去南杭。目前三分井下所產的煤，僅大槽一慶，井下略有機械設備，其他各井，幾乎都利用土法開採。現在一千五百餘礦工，每日分三班工作，平均每三人可產煤一噸，今後利用機械開採的效能，可照此此例增加三倍。</p>
<p>掘井進度　突增一倍</p>
<p>長塘尾的一號二號大井，戰後即開始繼續下　，惟以動力不足，進展甚緩，每月僅二十呎。本年四月，增加機械設備，掘井進展速度，突增一倍。以上并之直徑為求日後大量生產計，擬擴大到直徑十八呎，井內暫時以木架撑持，將來擬用鋼骨水泥　砌，井底磬石，係以壓風鑽機作一時半的鑽眼，長約三呎，至四呎，再用炸藥，平均鑽眼工作，約需時三小時，而提運石渣與水，則需時五小時，捲揚設備，係以容量十四立方呎的鐵桶用電校車升降。該項工程，包括并底進展，及地面工作，每班共有工人十四人及工程師一人，每月進展約四十五呎。</p>
<p>動力設備　趨向電化</p>
<p>動力的設備，煤廠方面，現在正力朮電化，以省人力，增加　產。在長塘尾新并附近，本年四月增設五十馬力電絞車一座，每分鐘三百十五立方呎的壓風機一座，及七十五瓩的柴油機一座，距新井約一里處，地名呌小冲，有臨時電廠，及小型修理廠，內有二百KVA發電機二只，供應全廠各地用電，廠內則作普通修理。並配置普通零件，設備簡陋，尚不敷使用。</p>
<p>裝置新機　準備試電</p>
<p>泉江堰的發電廠，建築在一塊荒山野地裏，主持這個工程的，是赣西煤鑛局的電機處長陳邦樞，年輕的個子，黝黑的皮膚，和他的一頂大草帽，充分表現着他的毅力與苦幹精神。我這次在泉江堪和他初次見面，給予的唯一印象，是痛快，誠擊，和他的苦幹。現在泉江堰電廠有一千瓩的新襪器。他們不分晝夜的加工，已經裝置完竣，當着大熟天，技工們都怕機器的熱度燙手，為了趕工，就改在每天的淸早或是晚間來工作。在我離開泉江時，他們準備試電，因為廠屋建築，尚需時日，決定先行露天發電，以供全鑛的用電。</p>
<p>泉江堰電廠，是個大的家庭，因為他們將這塊開荒的園地，正名為泉江新村，員工的眷屬都住在一處，由他們自己組織火食團，自辦火食。男男女女與生龍活虎般的小孩子，都在一起共同生沽，共同工作，親親熱熟的過得一團和氣。</p>
<p>大量生產　計劃已定</p>
<p>今後高坑煤鑛大規模的生產計劃，已經決定，在長塘尾的新井工程，一號，二號直井，為求大規模生產計，擬擴大直徑十八呎，井的總深度，約九百五十呎，在六百廿五呎及九百五十呎兩處，各開石門，以通各煤層。一號直井擬設置罐籠二只，用六百馬力的電絞車升降，專為升降石渣與材料，及工人上下之用，二號直徑則置七噸堤煤斗二只，用一千二百馬力的電絞車升降，提煤斗之并，下裝煤及井口卸煤，均為自動式，不需人力。</p>
<p>新式設備　準備實施</p>
<p>井下的設備，現在為了要增加生產，減輕人力，決定力求機械化，各項的設計工程，巳將完竣，卽又準備實施。將來井下所採用的新式機械，有容量三噸的煤車，（裝煤運煤）電車，（并下及地面運輸）自動裝石機，（裝石渣或煤）鴨嘴式轉運機，（工作面裝煤及巷這內運煤）飛鍊轉運機，（巷道運煤）壓風錢機，（開磬石巷）煤車牽引機，（控制煤車運輸）翻籠（自動卸煤），罐能角，（控制煤車入罐），罐　及安全設備，（，號井捲揚）一提煤斗，（自動卸煤）自動電泵，（井下排水）電風扇，（井下通風）信號管制器，（井下交通管制）井下煤倉，（自動開閉控制卸煤量）。</p>
<p>這些機械的設備，都是用電力或壓縮空氣，並有一切安全設備，以防止井下發生意外危險。現在他們有個希望：三年後，高坑鑛廠卽可達到每日產煤量五千噸，成為全國最新式的煤鑛。</p>

<h3>外匯資產移存國行　申報銀行已逾半數　財次徐柏園昨晚夜車返京覆命</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕商業銀行外匯金銀移存央行之準備工作，今日可告完成。當局限令本市商業銀行，於今日正午十二時完成申報工作；保險錢莊信託三業，限今日午後四時今部申報究竣。</p>
<p>昨日本市八十餘家商業銀行中，約有半數申報。省市銀行與商業銀行一體辦理，為顧及事實上之需要起見，截止期限得稍予展延。各銀行各地分行之外匯資產，亦由德行一併　報。申報登記之淸單，由各行莊公司之經理負賣簽字蓋章，以昭鄭重，將來如發現有弊端或不實之處，應實成其負全責。因財次徐柏園口於昨夜返京覆命，行莊公司之申報登記淸單，由金融管理局收受，將先在京審核，以決定其是否正確可靠，審查工作完畢後，即將其全部數額公布。</p>
<p>記者昨晤財次徐柏園氏，請渠對移存數額作一估計。徐氏婉拒，但表示外傳三億美元，略嫌過高。並稱：外匯移存央行，並非贈與之謂，在政府核定之範圍內，商業行莊仍可運用其外匯資產。例如進口生產工具，購買金圓公債等，政府將來當有一詳細辦法公布。又外匯之移存，對商業行莊並無損失，且因政府與民間之合作，使金圓信用趨於鞏固，外匯不再發生黑市，而商業行莊亦可不再因黑市而受社會之指責。</p>

<p>稍昂，惟交易冷靜，因棧單貨已於限期前出貨，市上均為現貨實銷交易，又因廠方之供應稀少，市仍堅昂。兵船粉開市甚低，為七元一角五分，旋卽昂至七元二角五分，略昂一分。老車粉開七元五角五分一價，計漲五分。紅蜂粉未成交，建成開七元二角半，雜牌粉略有參差，惟交易甚少。麩皮因廠方無供，市依舊站限價，小麥十元〇三角不變。</p>
<p>雜糧</p>
<p>市况鮮有變動，惟供應尚佳，黃豆油廠納取，成交尚多，新豆銷本街，亦有開出。苞米靑島帮續添，價砌一角。紅糧客帮亦有染指，交易轉旺，開出四百包左右。元麥銷呆未開，菉豆少有做開。芝蔴依限成交尚多，生仁廣帮不納，市勢疲，納戶少。</p>
<p>食油</p>
<p>平穩無波，豆油廠方開價仍站上日原盤，大統廠開四十九元七角，惟收市現貨因棧單出貨限期已迫，故略見疲落三角，其他現貨豆油均稍疲。生菜油站四十六元。生油靑島已禁止南運，人心更堅，故屹立限價而尚堅。凈生油五十九元九角，小車蔴油亦因存稀供少，有缺貨之感，開退桶小車油價五十元。豆餅客胃仍懈，廠方價仍四元六角，因存貨不多，供求兩稀，交易淸淡。</p>
<h3>浙省蔴棉豐產</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕中國紡建公司副總經理吳味經氏，刻自杭州·蕭山。海寗。奉賢。閔行一帶視察棉蔴種植情形歸來，據談：一般情形，尚稱良好，惟蔴產本年特豐。預計本年浙省約可產棉四十五萬担，蔴六十萬担。惟本年之收購問題，或不免將遭遇若干困難。蓋特殊性質之游資，業已　集四鄉。</p>
<p>浙省蔴產，集中浙東一帶。本年繁殖者係紡建自印度及台灣運來之蔴種，印度種每畝可收七担，合種可收四祖半至五担，故蔽之產量較去年增加一倍。棉之產量，因近月來雨水頻繁，影響結鈴。其中特以土棉情形最劣，每畝僅得籽棉六七十斤。改良棉去年方在浙省開始繁殖，惟僅佔全省棉產百分之十五，故產量每畝雖均超出百斤，惟對總產量之增加，影響不大。甚望天時速即轉晴，俾棉產不致遭受嚴重之影響云。</p>
<h3>人造絲配價　改按市價十足計算</h3>

<h3>各廠勢售不寂　株紗走銷呆滯　布疋交易淸淡人心不振</h3>
<p>昨日棉紗市况，以銀根仍鬆，各廠拋售不寂，走銷呆滯，市呈供過於求之狀。市上二十支紗曾跌進限度以內，細紗因各紗廠直接開售與複製業，塲內供應不多，但需要亦稀，市氣平和。四十二支金城現售一千零三十三元，廿一支雙馬七百八十三元，交易已轉入正常。</p>
<p>又訊：棉紗自經當局嚴厲管制，拋售轉多後，金陵路一帶紗綫門莊，照限價已有供售，每人限購一小包，如鑫泰，永泰昌，中國紗布公司等，均有人例隊購買。</p>

<h3>棉布交易對象　吸限門莊布噸</h3>
<p>棉布市况，因當局對倉庫棧房等檢查甚嚴，人心益形　　，且客帮所辦之貨，無法逃運，故初開時即有北路客商拋售，本市各號及散戶亦來吐售，同業了結亦衆。長江帮與徐州·蚌埠等帮，甚鮮吸納，交易清稀。染廠以色布去化呆滯，以免資金關殺，反將白坯布在市轉賣。</p>
<p>塲內各經紀人運當局指示，以門莊布號為交易對手，對於字號客莊，則使可代為賣出，拒絕代為買進。並傳路上貨運必須携帶成交單備查，倘被察出運往字號，將受干涉之處，各方懍於當局抑平物價之嚴厲措置，人心絕鮮振作。</p>
<p>十二磅龍頭細布自永信布號拋開六百疋，價廿九元三角，繼有散戶互吐，步降至廿八元五角，最後為廿八元八角，比上日續跌五角。四君子元嗶嘰因秋凉銷暢，僅挫二角。金運妙舞元嗶嘰漢口帮搜求，仍站廿七元六角原盤。其餘各布亦均跟退，以喇叭　B細布猛跌七角為獨鉅。</p>
<p>又訊：紡建公司隔日開售之五福B細布，價為廿三元八角，每戶一律配售四十疋。玩傘漂布廿六元八角，每戶均配二十疋。並悉近日本市門莊布號，如日新盛，信大祥，協大祥等，每晨八時餘即有排隊發售限價布疋，但仍剪去商標。又悉：華豐染廠有三九〇美亭士林開出一百餘疋。</p>
<h3>茶貸提高十倍　未邀當局核准</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕記者頃晤安微茶葉公司韓總經理，據告：全國合作社物品供銷處，日前派員趨前磋商，本年度祁門各合作社所製就之紅茶推銷事宜，結果祁門沙灣合作社業經獲得協定，並推派馬希白來滬主持一切，聞不久即有蔓額到貨。</p>
<p>又悉：此間茶葉公會，前曾電請四聯總處，將本年度茶貸提高十倍，每担為法幣八千萬至一億元，並請將限期寬限至三個月一案，邇因當局實施經濟管制緊急政策，未蒙核准，惟茶商則以茶葉不特有關外銷，抑且足以影響國內生產，故刻下擬推代表晋京，有所請示，同時對茶貸利息，亦圖减低。</p>
<p>昨日茶市，內銷茶依然平穩若苦，至於外銷花色，則在貨稀需活中，一致秀色可人，脚地亦頗鞏固。</p>

<h3>月餅</h3>
<p>— 知白</p>
<p>倒底是秋天了，南京路兩旁許多馬路口的西瓜攤已經一個也找不到。前幾天賢一塊紅紙包裏的木牌，大書「眞正包拍平湖南門西瓜」的地方，今天木牌上包着紅紙如故，上面的字却已經改為「月餅上市」。小孩子們羨慕地　在熱烘烘的爐十四週看着。</p>
<p>忽然想起，每年到了陰歷中秋左右，報紙上往往有一段應時文章，談談中秋節禮如何昂貴，商店的生意如何較前減色……之類，而其中幾乎每年總有一句：「××園的大月餅最大的竟需若干若干圓，實在令人咋舌」云云。我常常在懷疑：這種大月餅真有人要買麼？除了擺在桌子上或者可以博得客人一聲贊賞之外，又有什麼意思呢？而可以拿來炫闊的東西多得很，比那麼一個大月餅更靈巧更精致的不知多少，何必要那麼大那麼蠢的月餅？動手吃時必需「開刀　割」，與團　夜宴的情調又是何等的不一致啊！</p>
<p>前幾天看見一本新到的西洋雜誌，在某一頁的補白中寫着：「在你批評午餐菜肴太劣之前，請光想一想：全世界至少有四分之一的人口，已經到了鋨得奄奄一息的地步！」一時聯想到許多東西：馬路上老老小小全家討飯的難民，戰區逃出來的學生結隊行乞－還有，却就想到了××園的大月餅，今年的最高紀錄該是多少錢一個呢？</p>
<p>然而，報上說，政府已經決定了督促人民實施節約，嚴禁中秋　贈禮物，食物店製造月餅，也不准窮奢極侈的多所糜費（大意）。</p>
<p>這實在是很賢明的措施。不過，單靠法令，還是不夠的。當前最重要的一件事情，就是必須從上到下澈底養成一種樸實無華的風氣。</p>
<p>我有一個朋友，他的生活極嚴肅，不吃酒，不抽香烟，不賭錢，不跳舞，作事極負實，從不遲到早退。但是他每個月的意外支出仍舊可觀，而公司每年考績的時候，晋　總是輪不到他。他的意外支出是什麼呢？原來他們公司裏有一位紅得發紫的庶務，他記熟了每一位經理副理和他們的太太的生日，一到時候就拿了大紅帽子呌大家依次簽名出禮。經理新近得了一位孫少爺，大家馬上致送湯餅之敬。副理斬近納寵。大家馬上致送賀儀。我的那位朋友每月用在這上面的　用要占到他薪水的三分之一，但是，沒有辦法，他逃都逃不了！也許因為沒有能够極痛快極漂亮的每次立刻掏錢出來罷，庶務章生就在背後馬他一派頭介小」！</p>
<p>他們的經理先生一肉口聲聲主張節檢，主張刻苦耐勞，但是對下屬送禮之風是向不反對的，而對於大家的「派顧」却極為重視，說是公司「體面攸關」。庶務先生旣常在說我的那位朋友「派頭小」，於是經理先生日久也就頗有所聞；印象旣壞，我的朋友就倒了霉。</p>
<p>其實，我看每一個上海人都多多少少的為了「派頭」二字受罪。在內地時，身上穿得破舊一點大家不以為意，我那時就妄想，也許道一下倒可以把「只重衣衫不重人」的觀念改了罷。豈知大家一圓上海，第一件事情就是大做衣服！你做他做，大家都做，結果便自己也好像非做不可了。錢多麼？未必——「派頭」要緊而巳！結果是：以一般上海人的收入而論，如果肯以「布衣暖菜飯飽」自足，恐怕倒是大多數都尚可勉强渡過的。然而偏偏不肯毅然丟棄「派頭」，於是該穿藍布袍子的偏要穿嗶嘰，該吃一葷二素的偏要吃二葦一素。明明賺二百元一月的薪水，起居服用等等却要給別人以每月賺五百元的感覺，寗可鬧虧空。</p>
<p>就說那個××園的大月餅罷，大月餅的味道難道和康價的小月餅就眞有什麼兩樣？其每年之必然要產生幾個「龐然大物」者，也就是專供考究「派頭」的人們的需要罷了。</p>
<p>但願在禁製大月餅的時候，把這個害人不淺的「派頭觀念」也加以澈底的剷除！</p>
<h3>讀叔範題沈雲英手貴漫成二首</h3>
<p>— 黃雲眉</p>
<p>蛾眉幾許見錚錚，史筆無端有重輕，一代動名歸石　，何人能道沈　英？（明史張獻忠傳，使謂獻忠攻道州，守備沈至緒戰　，其女再戰奪父屍還，城獲全等語而己。）</p>
<p>殘墨寥亦不羣，興亡哀思更紛紜，料瞧怕入梅村手，三百年來始遇君。</p>
<h3>河堤感事</h3>
<p>— 丁道衡</p>
<p>風急河堤亂絮奔，諸般幽想助消魂，鶯飛草長春何味？海誓山盟死莫論。漾漾溪潮仍早午，依依茅屋自寒溫，十年悟澈持齊婦，未受優曇一點恩。</p>
<h3>月光浴及其他</h3>
<p>— 起鳳</p>
<p>愛美是人類的天性；尤其是女子，一生中幾乎離不了一個「美」字。美國的婦女每年單在化裝品上的消耗就達六億美元，此外在美容院裏的巨額化費，更是多得無法統計。</p>
<p>其實，美是沒有時間性的；最「新」的美也許就是最老」的美。</p>
<p>日光浴最近在美國真是風行極了，他們認為這不但有益健康，且能增進美觀。電影中，雜誌上，常見男女們穿了游泳衣，戴了黑眼鏡，悠閒地躺在太陽下，把皮膚晒成褐紅色；那知日光浴在十五世紀時意大利國內就很盛行了。當時，一班時髦的靑年女子還喜歡在幽靜的月光下行月光浴呢！</p>
<p>近年來有許多女子喜歡把頭髮往上梳，用釵夾住，凉爽而舒適，俗稱為「道士頭」；正不知這種新式的梳法在好久以前早為南美的印第安婦人所探用了。她們把有黏性的蜜搓在頭髮裏，然後再用虹色或珠光色的魚鱗塗在頭髮上，使它格外地艷麗光耀。</p>
<p>紅光或紫色的蔻丹塗在手指甲或脚指甲上該是何等地誘人！有人說：這眞是美的一個出奇的表現；可是這批愛用蔻丹的麼登婦女實在已經落後了；我們當然知道，我國古代的婦女早就知用鳳仙花的花瓣來染她們的指甲，使它們發出一種淡紅或深紅的光彩。</p>
<p>不久以前，某探臉家發掘了一個秘魯的古墓，裏面埋着一位女的乾屍（木乃伊），算起來，那女子是早在一千年以前埋入土中的，可是當他細細地觀察後，這千年的女屍倒也是挺摩登的呢！—她的面頰上和嘴唇上塗有胭脂，眉毛被剃去了，頭髮是短短的，手指甲及脚指甲上也染有顏色，旁邊還有一隻布袋，裏面放了她生前所用的粉撲，毫毛鉗，一隻用羽毛裝飾着的粉鏡匣裏還有胭脂，唇膏，和香粉！</p>
<h3>各得其所</h3>
<p>— 如是</p>
<p>一天，一個法國旅客在印度一個小村落裏忽然發現了一個雕刻得很精巧佛像。他就問出賣那個佛像的古玩商：「要多少錢？」</p>
<p>他說：「先生遠道而來，我祗要你七十五個羅比。」</p>
<p>旅客說：「旣然如此，看在我是遠客的面上，就算了四十五個羅比吧。一</p>
<p>店主雙手向天，大呌起來：「四十五個羅比嗎！你簡直是和我開玩笑了！別人聽見了不要笑嗎？</p>
<p>旅客說：「四十五個羅比，不能再多。一</p>
<p>店主大怒，說：一不行。你旣要這東西，爽性讓我送了給你吧。</p>
<p>旅客伸手拿佛像，說：「贊成！你實在太客氣了。多謝多謝。不過，常言道禮尚往來，所以，我現在也想送一點小小禮給你，你不會生氣罷？」</p>
<p>「那裏話！當然不生氣的。</p>
<p>「好，那麼這是我的一點點薄禮。一共是四十五個羅比，聊表徵意，請你收下。」</p>
<p>店主把錢收下，兩位彬彬有禮的君子欣然而別</p>
<h3>雨夜</h3>
<p>— 調鸚</p>
<p>雨夜的街燈似乎比平時稀少。那麼零零落落的，三盞兩盞，在一片漆黑中點綴着幾圈琥珀色的微光。然而，潤濕的路面反映着這些燈光，却嚴然像是地面上舖着一條蜿蜒的金色的絲帶。</p>
<p>前幾天還擠在路旁乘凉的人們給雨絲次了進去，而且，運寢室的電燈都已經熄了。</p>
<p>留下的祗有輕輕的琤縱的雨聲，祗有我的雨衣偶然擦過梧桐樹時素索一響，此外：一片靜寂</p>
<p>忽然我看見花木扶疎中有一問小小的平房，淺紫的實簾中隱隱露出了一絲燈光。忽然，我聲見了靜靜的，緩慢的演奏鋼琴的聲音，</p>
<p>正像綠油油的葉子在雨中分外見得葱蘢一樣，這片段的琴聲似乎為這寂靜的街道平添了不少美麗。</p>
<p>我欣然舉步。我知道：過去的已經過去了，應該過去的也一定要過去。——然而，竟還有這種無可奈何的依戀，像是黏在我的心上一樣。</p>
<h3>東麟西爪</h3>
<p>— 蒼雨</p>
<p>在英格蘭的東凱斯德城中，有一座玻璃飯店。它外部的牆壁，屋內的地板，傢俱，以及門窗等，都用各種不同顏色的玻璃造成。牆壁上還雕刻着極大的岡畫，地板是用一種不滑的正方形的花玻璃鋪成，排成種種悅目的圖案。陽光照射時，光綫從各處反射出來，光亮閃耀，蔚為奇觀。</p>
<p>最近捷克發明了一種「西龍」絲襪，該項新玻璃絲襪已在捷克布拉格開始應市，據發明者的太太說，她曾每日穿每日洗，而一雙西龍絲襪在連穿四百天後，非但不破，而且一絲不走，較美國尼龍絲襪耐穿得多。</p>

<p>甲午之役，日雖戰勝前淸，尚標榜扶韓獨立，且有俄與之爭雄，至甲辰戰結，樸　茅司條約，俄認日一切特權，日乃逐步展開其虎嚥狼吞之　吻，先以林權助與韓外部締所謂日韓新協約，定為一保護國」、，而收其外交權，對外諸事由日本代表，以消其國際地位，繼設統監府，以伊藤博文為統監，實際同於太上政府。後因海牙密使事件，韓島被迫讓位於太子，解散軍隊，而全國軍政權悉歸於日，僅存廬名。至一九一〇以所謂「一進會」之「請頭」，而合併告成。計共四個重要階段，每階段有其約文，每次約文有其簽字之大臣，當時日方威刦利誘，無所不至，未必盡出於本心。現在新國成立，為洗積恥，咎及旣往，自亦不得不然。至於何人何罪，吾儕可不必置詞。然「奸」之對面為「忠」，有厚顏辱國之人，即有抗節舍生之士，表彩忠義，風示人羣，固無間於彼此也。</p>

<h3>「安全第一」　請警政當局加緊管制交通</h3>
<p>無軌電車司機故意衝撞三輪車</p>
<p>編輯先生：九月二日下午七時半左右，我在愚　路江蘇路口趁廿路無軌電車回家，當電車駛近同路漁光邨時，突見電車前面行人道旁有三輪車一輛，緩慢行駛，車上有客十名，當時電車離三輪車僅二尺許，但司機并不煞車，擬開足馬力搶行外擋，但以距離過近，自後直撞，三輪車上乘客被彈出丈餘，數秒鐘後，即被該車輾傷，由此而想到都市交通的安全問題，現有幾點意見，願和大家研究；</p>
<p>（一）對於電車公司當局：電車肇禍，可以說在上海市民的腦中印象特深。考其原因，不外電車駕駛員技術太差，修養不夠，和車輛太舊，這幾點公司當局應負百份之百的責任，希望隨時隨地加以注意。</p>
<p>（二）對於公用當局：在上海機動車駑駛員大多經過公用局考試後才准錄用，電車鴐駛員自不應例外，以後更當加緊限制，勿使技術低劣者混跡其間。</p>
<p>（三）對於警務當局：以前實行過的安全運動，希望每季能舉行一次，（時間定為一星期）。以便駕駛員提高警覺，并嚴格執行機動車輛超速之取締，和交通規則之遵守。朱翼嗚敬啓</p>

<h3>Truth Revealed in Stock Dumping Case, Xu Baiqi Leaked Secrets, Whether Yuan Yang'an Jointly Profiteered Remains Unclear</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Nanjing, August 8] After the arrest of Tao Qiming, Xu Baiqi, Yuan Yang'an, and other suspects involved in the Yongsheng Yarn stock dumping case, the Criminal Police Team of the Police Department conducted continuous interrogations. The case has now reached a stage where it is hoped that the three suspects will be transferred to the Special Criminal Court by the Police Department on the afternoon of the 9th. The interrogations conducted by the Criminal Police Team of the Police Department in recent days were conducted individually. According to the confessions of the three suspects, Xu Baiqi has been identified as the one who leaked the news. Xu has formally admitted this on the 8th. Xu was able to obtain the news because he was ordered to draft the telegrams for the bank's two-day closure and the order to suspend trading on the Shanghai and Tianjin stock exchanges. However, Xu only admitted during his confession that he unintentionally leaked the news, which led Tao Qiming to learn of it and go to Shanghai to dump stocks for profit. He insisted that he himself had no intention of profiting from it. During his confession, Tao Qiming pointed out that he had obtained the news from Xu and that the stock dumping was also instructed by Xu. He learned the news on the 18th and immediately flew to Shanghai. On the one hand, he informed his wife, Li Guolan, to dump stocks, and on the other hand, he discussed it with Yuan Yang'an. At the same time, because his plane ticket to Shanghai was purchased through Xu Zhuanghuai, Xu also knew about it, and Xu's wife's stock dumping was also due to her learning of the secret. During his confession, Yuan Yang'an also admitted that Tao had discussed it with him, but denied that he had dumped any stocks. The Police Court dispatched investigators to Shanghai again on the 8th. Zheng Haoming, the chief of the Criminal Police Team, also spoke on the phone with Yu Shuping, the chief of the Shanghai Police Bureau, on the 8th to exchange information about Yuan Yang'an's involvement. After further interrogation on the 9th, it will be possible to determine whether Yuan was jointly involved in profiteering. Regarding the details of Xu Baiqi's leakage of information, Zheng Haoming, the chief of the police team, had two separate conversations with him, telling him that special criminal offenses do not necessarily result in execution and that sentencing depends on the severity of the crime. Xu told the truth on the 8th, saying that after drafting the telegram at noon on the 18th, he went downstairs from the minister's office and met Tao Qiming. He then told Tao about the stock exchange suspension. Tao then asked if it was in preparation for currency reform, but Xu said he could not judge. According to people who participated in the interrogation, based on the confessions, psychology, and polygraph tests, the truth of the case has been revealed as far as Xu Baiqi is concerned.</p>
<h3>President Sun's Resignation Not Confirmed</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Nanjing, August 8] News from the Legislative Yuan: President Sun has not resigned. President Sun attended the opening session of the second session of the Legislative Yuan on the 7th despite being ill in the morning. He took a half-day leave in the afternoon because he was physically unable to continue. The report in a certain newspaper that President Sun firmly resigned from his current position is purely speculation and has no basis in fact.</p>
<h3>Preliminary Draft of the Provisional Property Tax Regulations Completed</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Nanjing, August 8] The preliminary review group of the Finance and Banking Committee of the Legislative Yuan for the Provisional Property Tax Implementation Regulations continued to meet on the morning of the 8th and completed the整理 of the preliminary draft of the regulations, consisting of 23 articles.

<h3>Legislative Committee Economic Experts Express Opinions: Capital Increase for Business Banks is Necessary, Pointing out Significant Past Misdeeds of Business Banks</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, August 8] Regarding the capital increase for commercial banks, many Legislative Committee members and financial experts unanimously believe that commercial banks during and after the war have not only made no contribution to the country, but have instead taken advantage of the situation to engage in black market activities, hoard goods for speculation, speculate for profit, spread rumors, disrupt the market, and raise prices. The instability of the people's livelihood over the past decade is due to this. They advocate that the government should strictly prohibit the business activities of commercial banks. The capital increase plan this time should be implemented thoroughly, regardless of any difficulties. They also point out several of the most significant misdeeds of commercial banks: (1) The number of commercial banks has gradually increased since the war, but the total amount of capital has not increased with prices. (2) Commercial banks hoard goods for speculation, buy and sell gold and foreign exchange, and engage in speculative arbitrage, engaging in illegal business activities for profit. Their impact on prices is ten times that of inflation. (3) After the currency reform, commercial banks are still engaged in various activities to undermine the currency system. The most significant of these is that all the foreign exchange, gold, and silver held by commercial banks have not been exchanged for gold yuan in accordance with the government's orders with banks designated by the government. On the other hand, as prices gradually stabilize, they cannot profit from price increases, so they engage in massive hoarding. According to news from Shanghai, a large amount of hoarding was discovered during warehouse searches in Shanghai, even those purchased at the beginning of the victory. The owners of these hoarded goods are mostly commercial banks, direct and indirect operators, or those who rely on commercial banks. They take advantage of opportunities and power to obtain large loans from the government and then use them as capital for hoarding. It should also be noted that the capital increase plan for commercial banks stipulates that the total amount of the capital increase should be deposited in the Central Bank within three months after the promulgation of the plan. However, the interpretation of this article should be that after the capital increase of each commercial bank is deposited in the Central Bank, it should be frozen and never be returned after review. If this is not the case, then commercial banks will not be able to borrow capital from each other and collude to cheat. Recently, there have been many rumors that banks in Shanghai and other places have transferred large amounts of money to Guangzhou to purchase black market Hong Kong dollars in order to transfer funds to Hong Kong. The government should pay more attention to this kind of unscrupulous behavior and restrict commercial banks in various places from remitting money to Guangzhou. In this way, their cunning schemes will not be able to survive.</p>
<h3>China Can Negotiate International Bank Loans as Appropriate</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Nanjing, August 8] News from the Information Bureau: A report stated that China would borrow 600 million US dollars from the International Development Bank for the reform of the currency system in order to support the new currency, and cited European countries such as the Netherlands, Belgium, Czechoslovakia, and Yugoslavia as examples, saying that they had all borrowed funds from the International Development Bank when reforming their currency systems. According to the bank's regulations, loan requests are based on [??] recognition [??]. China had subscribed to 600 million US dollars in shares when joining the bank, etc. According to news from the Ministry of Finance, China has paid its subscribed share款 in accordance with regulations after the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development opened, and it could have submitted a loan application to the bank. However, due to the instability of the domestic economy and the lack of loan conditions, it was unable to make this application. Now that China has implemented currency reform and the economy is expected to stabilize, it can negotiate loans with the bank as appropriate. Furthermore, since the bank opened, it has only handled four loans: 250 million US dollars to France, 195 million US dollars to the Netherlands, 40 million US dollars to Denmark, and 12 million US dollars to Luxembourg, all to assist those countries in developing reconstruction projects.</p>

<h3>Revenue from Special Account for US Aid Supplies to be Frozen as Much as Possible, Utilization Committee and Economic Cooperation Administration Open Joint Symposium</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Nanjing, August 8] The Executive Yuan's US Aid Utilization Committee and the US Economic Cooperation Administration's China 分署 held the sixth joint symposium at 3:00 PM on the 8th at Official Residence No. 1 of the Executive Yuan.

During the meeting, reports were made on the points that had been agreed upon in past negotiations regarding the US aid special account. After discussion, they were all accepted by the joint meeting. The main points are as follows: (1) The US Aid Committee and the US Economic Cooperation Administration both believe that the sales revenue of US aid materials in the special account should be frozen as much as possible in order to ensure that the utilization of US aid can cooperate with the Chinese government's measures to stabilize currency value. (2) Both parties agreed that the expenditure in the special account should be reduced as much as possible and that a budget should be prepared for all expected expenditures. (3) Both parties agreed that the national currency expenditures required for the industrial construction supplementary equipment plan should be borne by the recipient of the US aid plan. However, only if the US Aid Committee and the US Economic Cooperation Administration determine that the recipient is indeed unable to bear it can funds be allocated from the special account for assistance. (4) Both parties agreed that the expenditure款 in the special account should only be allocated when the various projects (rural reconstruction, industrial construction and supplementary equipment, and the unfinished relief projects of the Executive Yuan's China Relief Organization) actually need funds to be paid to the contracting parties. (5) Both parties agreed that when reviewing the expected expenditures in the budget, strict consideration should be given to whether there is any inflationary nature. In addition, reports were made on the fertilizer distribution principles and the resolutions of the Cotton Group Committee, which were also discussed and accepted by the joint meeting.</p>

<h3>Gasoline Prices for Private Users to be Revised Today, Public Utilities Purchase Oil at Old Prices with Certificates</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Nanjing, August 8] Most of China's gasoline is imported from abroad, and the amount of foreign exchange consumed is considerable. It is urgent to effectively limit the amount of gasoline used in order to meet the purpose of conservation. In addition to the government's gradual increase in import tariffs, it is learned that the government authorities have approved the sales price and supply methods of US aid oil that has begun to be transported to China, as follows: (1) Public transportation utilities will still be supplied at the old prices as of August 19. However, this public transportation utility is limited to those that have been approved to operate and have fixed ticket prices by the central and provincial and municipal authorities. Those who meet the above regulations will be issued certificates by the Oil Allocation Committee of the Import and Export Management Committee, and they will be allowed to purchase oil at the old prices. (2) Other gasoline users will have their gasoline prices revised from September 9 based on the actual import cost and tariffs. In order to comply with the government's laws and regulations on suppressing prices, the oil companies will not include their due profits. The old prices will be maintained for other oil products such as kerosene, diesel, and fuel oil. It is expected that the number of gasoline used by private persons will be reduced after the above regulations are implemented. At the same time, public transportation utilities will still be able to purchase oil at the old prices, which will not affect other general prices. (Please refer to the fourth edition for gasoline price increases in Shanghai.)</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>The Premise for the Resumption of Negotiations Between the U.S. and the Soviet Union</h3>
<p>Former U.S. Secretary of State James Byrnes delivered a speech in Seattle on the 6th, urging Western allies to reopen negotiations with the Soviet Union to discuss the German question, in order to reach a unified agreement on a peace treaty with Germany. On the one hand, he defended the Yalta Agreement, and on the other hand, he advised the American people not to assume that compromise between the U.S. and the Soviet Union would be a surrender by the U.S. to the Soviet Union. Byrnes believed that the Soviet people definitely did not want war, so he said, "Even if the Soviet Union has the possibility of further aggression, we cannot therefore abandon all hope of peaceful negotiation." Byrnes' speech was full of zeal for seeking world peace, and all those who long for peace agree with it in principle. However, whether the opinions of the U.S. and the Soviet Union can be unified through the path of peaceful negotiation is a serious question. Therefore, after hearing Byrnes' speech, it is indeed necessary to comprehensively analyze the relationship between the U.S. and the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>Anyone who studies international issues believes that the international issues after World War II have undergone fundamental changes. The "German question" that people generally refer to now is almost completely different from the "German question" of two years ago. In the past, the opinions of Britain, the United States, France, and the Soviet Union were generally the same on how to disarm Germany, how to eliminate Nazi ideology from the German people, and how to control Germany so that it would also become a peaceful and democratic country and no longer threaten the peace and security of Europe. But now Germany has become an object of contention between the East and the West, and everyone wants to win the favor of the German people, attempting to use the German people as a tool to oppose the other side. Since the establishment of the West German agreement, the Western allies of Britain, the United States, and France have been working hard on three things: first, the merger of the three countries' occupation zones; second, the implementation of currency reform in West Germany; and third, supporting the Germans in convening a constitutional assembly to form a new democratic government. The intention is to prevent the intrusion of Soviet forces into Western Europe. Seeing the planned actions of the Western allies in West Germany, the Soviet Union felt like a thorn in its side. Therefore, it also incited anti-American sentiment among the German people in East Germany, and also stirred up waves in Berlin in an attempt to offset the impact of the Western allies' actions in West Germany, making the world worry that the Berlin crisis would constitute the starting point of World War III. For two months, under this situation of mutual stimulation and turbulence, the world has been holding its breath, hoping for the elimination of the Berlin crisis.</p>
<p>Although the Moscow negotiations have exhausted all possible detours and twists, after a month of talks, a turning point has finally been achieved. If both the East and the West have the sincerity to compromise, then there is great hope for transforming hostility into harmony in the international arena. Therefore, the world's attention has shifted from Moscow to Berlin, especially the meeting of the commanders of the four powers' occupation zones, which not only discussed the unification of the Berlin currency system, but also touched on how to lift the Soviet Union's blockade. People especially felt that the international gloom had a hope of being swept away. However, at the time when the atmosphere of the four-power commanders' negotiations was at its most harmonious, the German Communist Party suddenly engaged in demonstrations, marches, and riots. They shouted anti-American slogans, invaded the Berlin City Hall, and attempted to overthrow the democratically elected Berlin City Government by force. As a result, the problem arose again. On the surface, the actions of the German Communist Party seem to be indistinguishable from the attitude of the Soviet Union, but in reality, the instigation of the German Communist Party is definitely not simple. This newspaper's editorial on the 3rd pointed out that the actions of the German Communist Party in Berlin will be an important factor in determining the success or failure of the four-power negotiations. In less than a few days, the German Communist Party, as expected, destroyed the Berlin City Council and attempted to form a Communist Party city government. Seeing the Soviet police's indulgence and failure to stop the German Communist Party's atrocities, the intentions of the Soviet Union are already well known.</p>
<p>The deterioration of the Berlin crisis, no matter from which angle it is observed, cannot be ignored. The Berlin negotiations have already stalled, and the Western three powers will also lodge a protest with Soviet General Kotikov. Future developments are even more unpredictable. British officials' expression of shock at the deterioration of the Berlin crisis is by no means deliberately creating panic and arousing public anxiety, because the significance of the Berlin turmoil is indeed too serious. Therefore, we believe that if the four-power negotiations or the U.S.-Soviet negotiations are not resumed, so be it. If they are to be reopened, then the most important premise is the sincerity of both sides. As the saying goes, "Sincerity can move mountains," otherwise, if negotiations are conducted on the one hand and unexpected incidents occur on the other, no matter how hard diplomats try to mediate, it will always be in vain.</p>
<h3>Sun Lianzhong Issues Statement Regarding Gathering and Causing Trouble by Refugee Students, Hoping Students Will Abide by the Law, Those Who Deliberately Violate It Will Be Severely Punished According to Law</h3>
<p>[This newspaper's Nanjing dispatch on the 8th] Garrison Commander of the Capital, Sun Lianzhong, issued a statement regarding refugee students coming to Nanjing and gathering to cause trouble, stating: Since the Communist bandits expanded their rebellion, students in the bandit areas, with the will to love the country and support the government, were unwilling to be coerced by the bandits. Experiencing dangers and obstacles, they have successively fled south and come to Nanjing via roundabout routes. Their determination and the hardships they have encountered are deeply sympathized with, and the government is especially concerned. Most of the students who have come to Nanjing cherish themselves, respect themselves, and abide by the law, but there are still a few students who make excessive demands and take actions that go beyond the bounds. There have even been incidents of gathering to cause trouble, such as beating public bus ticket sellers and forcibly entering various theaters without tickets. A few days ago, there was another act of gathering to destroy the National Grand Theater, causing various theaters to feel threatened and dare not operate. Although the above disputes occasionally arise due to improper words and actions of transportation and theater staff, the aftermath is that students gather to cause trouble, beat people, and destroy property, resulting in actions and consequences that are contrary to the cause. Such illegal and unreasonable actions are particularly disruptive to social order. This command is responsible for the security of the capital. It earnestly hopes that students coming to Nanjing will appreciate the difficulties of the times, exercise reason, abide by the law, and strictly observe order. They must not abandon themselves and act rashly. Any reasonable requests should be immediately reported to their responsible personnel or instructors and made to the relevant authorities, which will do their best to resolve them. In the future, if there are any dealings with industry and commerce, they can directly report to the police station in charge for assistance. When dealing with soldiers, military police can also mediate on the spot or report to this command for handling. It is hoped that there will be no more incidents that violate laws and regulations. If there are any deliberate violations, they will be prosecuted as disrupting social order and severely punished according to law. It is also hoped that people from all walks of life will sympathize with refugee students and provide more assistance to enable them to unite and overcome difficulties together. This is what is earnestly hoped for.</p>
<h3>Garrison Headquarters Convenes Meeting to Discuss Refugee Student Issue</h3>
<p>[This newspaper's Nanjing dispatch on the 8th] The Garrison Headquarters of the Capital issued a public announcement on the 8th regarding the handling of the refugee student issue. It stated briefly: According to statistics from the Capital Police Department, from August 16th to September 8th, there have been as many as 52 incidents of refugee students gathering to cause trouble. As of the afternoon of the 7th, more than 300 students gathered and twice destroyed the National Grand Theater. That evening, they had conflicts with the World New Capital and two other theaters, causing the theaters to be unable to operate normally and greatly affecting social order. The headquarters attaches great importance to this matter and specially convened a meeting on the morning of the 8th with representatives from various security agencies and the Ministry of Education's Education Department, the Henan Provincial Association, and other units. It was decided that, on the one hand, all parties concerned would earnestly persuade and strictly discipline them, and immediately implement the methods formulated by the Ministry of Education to properly resettle them. On the other hand, the Ministry of Education will find ways to solve the students' entertainment problems. At the same time, it will formulate measures to order the police to stop illegal acts of gathering to cause trouble and destroying theaters at any time, or to arrest the ringleaders to maintain urban traffic facilities and entertainment venues.</p>
<h3>All Entertainment Venues in the Capital Suspended Business Yesterday</h3>
<p>Resuming Business Today After Petitioning and Receiving Guarantees</p>
<p>[This newspaper's Nanjing dispatch on the 8th] All entertainment venues in the capital took concerted action on the 8th to suspend business. The main streets and bustling areas of the city, as well as various commercial venues, were crowded with people, presenting an unprecedented scene. Movie theaters, Peking opera theaters, and tea houses in Confucius Temple, which usually accommodate a large number of spectators in the evening, were tightly closed with iron gates, desolate and desolate, and each hung a public notice saying: "This theater (hall) has been destroyed by fellow businesses and is concerned about the safety of customers. It is currently petitioning for protection, so it will be closed for one day today. We hope for your understanding." This situation is purely the result of refugee students from the bandit areas continuously forcing their way into theaters without tickets and gathering to cause trouble. However, after the Capital Film and Drama Industry Association sent representatives to the Garrison Headquarters of the Capital, the City Government, and the Police Department for petitions on the morning of the 8th, it has received assurances that it will resume business on the 9th under the strengthened guarantees and maintenance of the military police.</p>
<h3>School Buildings for Northeastern Temporary Universities and Middle Schools Have Been Resolved</h3>
<p>[This newspaper's Beiping dispatch on the 8th] School buildings for Northeastern Temporary University and Middle Schools have been completely resolved.

They will be returned starting from the 8th. Remedial classes and the Third Temporary Middle School will be located at Donggaozi in Tianjin. In addition, the complete list of students for the three Temporary Middle Schools has been verified. The First Temporary Middle School has 2,032 students, the Second Temporary Middle School has 1,970 students, and the Third Temporary Middle School has 1,960 students.</p>
<h3>Lei Zhongshu and Hu Wenhui Discuss the July 5th Incident Again on Behalf of Beiping People's Organizations, Expressing Opinions Based on Actual Situation and Legal Perspective</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency Nanjing dispatch on the 8th] Supervisory Committee member Hu Wenhui issued a statement on the 8th regarding the joint telegram sent by Beiping People's Organizations to the President, the Executive Yuan, and the Control Yuan regarding the July 5th incident, expressing opinions again on the actual situation and legal perspective of the "July 5th" incident. It is stated that: "The 'July 5th' incident indeed occurred after the imposition of martial law. The first paragraph of the report mentioned it and was not overlooked. However, Article 3 of the Martial Law Act stipulates that 'In the event of war or rebellion, when a certain place is still under siege by bandits or when dealing with extraordinary incidents, the highest commander of the naval and air forces in that location may declare temporary martial law in accordance with this law.' Northeastern students gathered at approximately 7:00 AM on July 5th, went to the Beiping City Council for petitions at 8:00 AM, and destroyed its doors, windows, and office equipment. At approximately 12:00 PM, they went to the residence of Deputy Chief Executive Li Yuyu for petitions. At 2:00 PM, they surrounded the residence of Xu Huidong in Dongjiaominxiang. At approximately 5:00 PM, two companies of the search battalion of the 208th Division and four armored vehicles arrived for deployment, and soldiers lay prone and cocked their weapons in a combat stance. It was not until 7:00 PM that Bai Shiwei, the deputy director of the police bureau who was in charge of command on the scene, told the student representatives in the courtyard that martial law had been declared and that everything would be discussed tomorrow, and instructed them to go back quickly. When Bai and other student representatives left the courtyard and instructed the students to disperse, gunshots rang out from the east and west. If we study it from the perspective of martial law, we can only use the term 'extraordinary incident.' Whether the Northeastern students' petition and destruction of the City Council and surrounding Xu's residence due to anger at the resolution of the City Council belongs to an 'extraordinary incident' is quite worthy of study. On that day, besides the Northeastern students' petition in Beiping, there were no other incidents that affected or harmed public safety and order, which is evidenced by Commander Fu's order not to allow soldiers to carry guns. Therefore, the imposition of martial law was specifically for the Northeastern students. Moreover, the martial law order was not issued at the beginning of the incident but when the students were about to disperse due to hunger, thirst, and fatigue. Even if we take a step back, the promulgation of a martial law order also has a certain legal procedure and public announcement method. According to Bai Shiwei, the martial law order was notified by the garrison command by telephone, and the students were unaware of it, which means that the martial law order was not widely announced. When students gathered for petitions during martial law, the legal action should have been only to forcibly disperse or detain them. As for the claim that bad elements had infiltrated and incited, the defending troops could have conducted a search and arrest on the student side and punished them separately according to law. However, they indiscriminately opened fire on the large student group, resulting in 28 deaths and injuries. Afterwards, they used various excuses to try to shirk responsibility, which is truly heartbreaking. Supervisory Committee members, in accordance with the powers conferred by the constitution, can, with their strict stance, impeach officials who violate the law and neglect their duties, and will never be biased or subservient to any environment. Since this case has been submitted for impeachment, the Executive Yuan should be allowed to handle it within the statutory period. The opinions of the Beiping people's organizations are probably only for the reference of those handling the case."</p>
<h3>Refugee Students Beat Drivers, Beiping Trolleys Suspended Operations Briefly</h3>
<p>27 Incidents of Beatings in the Past Three Days</p>
<p>[This newspaper's Beiping dispatch on the 8th] All trolleys in Beiping were suspended this morning, and traffic throughout the city was brought to a standstill, resuming normal operations at 11:00 AM. At 7:20 AM this morning, more than 200 Northeastern refugee students rushed from Beixinqiao towards Dongsi Archway, chasing trolleys and injuring drivers. Upon hearing the news, all ticket sellers and drivers fled to the Trolley Workers' Union in Dongzongbu Hutong, with students chasing after them, causing great chaos. After military police arrived and persuaded them, they dispersed. The trolley company hosted reporters today, reporting on the beatings. From the 6th to the 8th, there have been 27 incidents of beatings. The city's fare revenue is only over 5 billion, and the revenue and expenditure are seriously insufficient. With this blow again, the future of Beiping's transportation is worrying.</p>
<p>[Another dispatch] More than 400 Northeastern students in Beiping, divided into eight trucks, suddenly wanted to occupy the Guangmingdian Police Academy. However, some students at the police academy had not yet graduated. After persuasion from the school and security agencies, they left. The school also agreed to allocate some housing for their use, but only after all the students have graduated.</p>
<h3>Qiantang River's "Osmanthus Tide" Raging, Sweeping Away Thatched Huts and Cars</h3>
<p>[This newspaper's Hangzhou dispatch on the 8th] The magnitude of the Qiantang River's Haining Tide, the first phase of the Osmanthus Tide in the eighth lunar month, is unprecedented since the founding of the Republic of China. The tidal bore is as high as a small mountain, and exceeds ten feet at Yuetang. Along the area from Haining to Qilimiao, the strip stones on the fish-scale embankment were washed away by two or three levels. Wang Dongyuan and Chen Beida watched the tide a few days ago, and their car parked on the embankment was swept into the river. The ferocity of the tide can be seen. In the areas of Wengjiabu, Laoyancang, and Shiba Fort, the tidal waters swept away thatched huts outside the embankment and a large number of salt boards, killing and injuring many people. The Embankment Works Bureau has taken emergency rescue measures to avoid direct damage from the tide.</p>
<h3>Suzhou Rickshaw Pullers Strike to Protest Tax Increase</h3>
<p>Five Agitators Arrested and Interrogated</p>
<p>[This newspaper's Suzhou dispatch on the 8th] Suzhou rickshaw pullers suddenly went on strike in unison on the morning of the 8th to protest the increase in rickshaw rental fees by rickshaw companies. By 9:30 AM, rickshaws had disappeared. Amidst the chaos, the police station seized five individuals who had no identity in the industry but participated in inciting the strike and arrested them for interrogation. The dispute had not been resolved by 10:00 PM. Travelers to Suzhou from Nanjing and Shanghai felt greatly inconvenienced. Temporarily, some people seized the opportunity to organize porter teams to carry luggage for customers.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency Suzhou dispatch on the 8th] The county government summoned the chairman of the rickshaw pullers' union and ordered them to resume work that evening. At the time of dispatch, there were already a few rickshaws on the street, and it is expected that all will be restored tomorrow morning.</p>
<h3>Mao Jiaqi, Chief Prosecutor of the Hankou High Court, Accused of Corruption, Rumored to Have Accepted Bribes of Nearly 6,000 Taels of Gold</h3>
<p>[This newspaper's Hankou dispatch on the 8th] A shocking corruption case recently occurred in the judiciary here. The defendant is Mao Jiaqi, the chief prosecutor of the High Court, and the plaintiff is Gao Qianqing, a jailed traitor. Gao listed in the complaint that "When Mao Jiaqi was handling Gao's case, he secretly sent Mrs. Chen to extort four taels of gold from him. Gao's wife had no choice but to scrape together five taels and two qian of gold and hand it over to Yu Shouzheng of the Lao Fengxiang Gold Shop, who transferred it to Wang Zhichao of the Fuheng Silver Shop, which Mao jointly operated, for counting. Later, Mao became even more greedy and secretly sent Wang Zhichao to extort a building for housing. Because the house had already been sold, it could not be delivered, so Mao retaliated out of spite and framed him. Afterwards, Gao tearfully recounted the incident to the judicial authorities. Fearing that his misconduct would be exposed, Mao also sent Police Chief Li Xueqing to plead for a resolution and personally wrote a card, saying that he had smoothed things over with the Supreme Court and instructed him to wait quietly for a retrial," accusing Mao of corruption and violating the law, with convincing evidence. Just as the court was summoning the case, dozens of other victims' families listed 39 bribery cases of Mao, detailing the case, date, and amount of the bribe, totaling 5,956 taels of gold. For a time, those who heard it were shocked, and public opinion was in an uproar. Mao also published a statement, saying that although a certain Yu had invited Wang Zhichao to deliver a gift on behalf of Gao Yunqing, his wife had refused it and ordered him to return it immediately. Currently, in addition to the trial by the Wuchang Court, the Supervisory Committee's Office in the Hubei and Hunan region is also sending personnel to investigate. Mao has been working in Hubei for three years. Previously, he had been widely criticized for raising donations by taking advantage of his position and collecting gifts under the pretext of marriage and birthdays. Among the cases he is accused of this time, some may not be entirely factual, but several of them were previously thoroughly investigated by the judicial authorities, who believed that Mao's handling of traitor cases was indeed inappropriate and gave him a demerit. His recent transfer to the presidency of the Henan High Court is also related to the accusations from various parties.</p>
<h3>Chen Zhengquan, Bandit Leader of Huaying Mountain in Sichuan, Killed</h3>
<p>[This newspaper's Chengdu dispatch on the 7th] Bandits in Huaying Mountain in Sichuan are rampant. The provincial government launched a campaign to encircle and suppress them, and the Chongqing Pacification Headquarters established a Suppression Command to conduct a comprehensive suppression. The bandit leader Chen Zhengquan was recently killed. The bandit forces are expected to be completely eliminated by the end of October. Chen was a graduate of Chongqing University and served as the chairman of the Autonomous Association. He had considerable influence. His death has eliminated a major scourge for the local area.</p>
<h3>The Ping Commercial Daily Suspended Publication Due to False Report of Nie Rongzhen's Defection</h3>
<p>[This newspaper's Beiping dispatch on the 8th] The Ping Commercial Daily suddenly issued an "Extra Edition on Nie Rongzhen Leading His Troops to Defect" on the 5th. The municipal government authorities considered this news to be extremely absurd and, in addition to refuting it, ordered the newspaper on the 7th not to be published until its registration was officially approved.</p>
<h3>Treasure from Three Thousand Years Ago, Zhou Wenwang Ding, Rediscovered</h3>
<p>Still Sent to Chengde Treasure Museum for Storage</p>
<p>[Central News Agency Chengde dispatch on the 8th] The Zhou Wenwang Ding, lost for two years, has now been found by the 15th Army. After being sent to the Provincial Assembly for identification and verification, it was sent back to the Treasure Museum for display. This Ding was moved from the inner court to the Mountain Resort by Qianlong in the 44th year of his reign and is one of the most valuable of the Zhou Dynasty artifacts, commonly known as the ten Zhou Dynasty bronzes, and is a relic of the Zhou Dynasty from three thousand years ago. In order to display this artifact, the Qing court specially built a copper hall in the Mountain Resort. Later, the copper hall was dismantled and moved away by the Japanese, but this artifact was preserved. It was not until the Communist bandits entered Chengde that it was completely lost. Fan Jiong, a county official in Chengde, recovered seven pieces two years ago. Including this one, there are now eight pieces. The remaining two pieces are still missing.</p>

<h3>The Schumann Cabinet of France Fails Again, Queuille Ordered to Form Cabinet, Herriot Declines Due to Old Age and Illness</h3>
<p>[This newspaper's report] London, 8th, radio Paris: On the 8th at 3 pm, the President of France, Auriol, summoned 76-year-old statesman Herriot to attempt to form a cabinet. Mr. Herriot declined, citing his weak health and multiple ailments. It is reported that Mr. Herriot has suffered from phlebitis for a long time and is nearly deaf.</p>
<p>[This newspaper's report] London, 8th, radio Paris: Auriol summoned Queuille, the leader of the Radical Socialist Party in parliament, on the 8th to attempt to form a cabinet. Mr. Queuille, 64 years old, has held minor cabinet positions 16 times between 1920 and 1940 and served as Minister of Public Works in the short-lived Schumann cabinet. Mr. Queuille replied that he would consult with the leaders of various parties on whether to accept the cabinet formation and would respond by noon on the 9th.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Paris, 8th] Prime Minister Schumann submitted his resignation last night after a vote of no confidence in the National Assembly. The Schumann government was only two days old. President Auriol is now considering inviting French statesman Herriot to form a cabinet to form a national coalition government to cope with the most serious political crisis since the war. Auriol is determined to prevent a showdown between the Communist Party and the Gaullist faction at any cost, as this would be a death sentence for the current centrist parties in power. Prime Minister Schumann resigned after the Socialist Party and the Radical Socialist Party suddenly changed their minds and voted against him in the National Assembly on the 7th. Whether Herriot is willing to express his loyalty and patriotism to take on this difficult task is questionable. He is 76 years old, suffers from many ailments, and is hard of hearing, often struggling even to perform his duties as Speaker of the Assembly. If Herriot refuses to come forward, Auriol may invite a member of the Radical Socialist Party to form a new cabinet, with former Finance Minister Mayer or former Prime Minister Marie being possible candidates, but the hope is minimal. Communist leaders Thorez and Duclos have repeatedly demanded to form a government.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Paris, 7th] The French Socialist Party and the Radical Socialist Party rebelled against Prime Minister Schumann during a vote of confidence in the Schumann cabinet in the National Assembly on the 7th, leading to his resignation. The parliament voted 295 to 285 against the Schumann cabinet, with 30 abstentions, creating France's third political crisis in six weeks. Following the vote, French statesman Herriot resigned from his position as chairman of the Radical Socialist Party. Herriot is also currently the Speaker of the National Assembly, and his actions demonstrate the division within the party. Schumann ignored the advice of his party members and requested a vote of confidence, announcing that he would resign if it failed, thus creating this crisis. Schumann could have indefinitely postponed the debate on the cabinet formation issue, but he accepted the challenge and failed by a margin of ten votes. To resolve the political crisis, the National Assembly may dissolve itself and hold general elections. In the general elections, the centrist parties are likely to fail, thus laying the foundation for a power struggle between the Communist Party and the Gaullist faction.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 7th] The collapse of the Schumann government was due to the Radical Socialist Party's last-minute disapproval of the grand plan for economic recovery. It is generally said that former Prime Minister Marie's organization of a mixed government of centrist parties and similar parties, rejecting the two extreme elements of the Communist Party and the Gaullist Party, was more intelligent, but his Finance Minister Reynaud's fiscal and monetary plan failed to gain majority support and thus failed. Reynaud's plan was divided into three parts: currency, cost of living, and salaries. Reynaud's intention was to stabilize the currency first, and the cost of living would naturally tend to stabilize. However, Schumann's Christian Social Party Finance Minister Pinot, under pressure from the labor unions, tried to stabilize wages first, then prices, and finally the currency, which was not approved by the Radical Socialist Party and also failed.</p>
<h3>Communist Disturbances in Berlin, US Determined to Strictly Stop Them, White House Holds Special Meeting to Discuss Countermeasures</h3>
<p>[This newspaper's report] Washington, 8th, broadcast: Marshall stated at a press conference today that we must do our best to curb the Communist Party's attempts to create chaos in Berlin.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 8th] The government is deeply concerned about the deteriorating Berlin crisis. Secretary of State Marshall plans to host reporters at noon on the 8th, but it is questionable whether he will be willing to break the official silence on the breakdown of the four-power talks. It is rumored that the Berlin talks have stalled, but President Truman's decision to convene a special meeting of the National Security Council indicates that Washington is taking the situation very seriously. Some diplomats here believe that if the Soviet Union sincerely wanted to resolve the Berlin issue, it would not have allowed the riots of the past few days to occur. Although there was optimism due to the promising progress of the Moscow talks and the decision of the four powers to try again to resolve the currency and blockade issues, the repeated riots have shattered this optimism. It is speculated that Truman's convening of a special meeting on the 7th was to plan US policy after the failure of negotiations.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, London, 7th] British Foreign Secretary Bevin, deeply concerned that the tense situation in Berlin, which has reached a near-crisis level, threatens the consultations currently being conducted in Berlin by the four Allied commanders, returned to London tonight. All sectors of the government are now openly criticizing the Soviet Union as the true instigator of the Berlin disturbances.</p>
<h3>Soviet Air Force Exercise Threatens Berlin Airlift</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Berlin, 8th] The Soviet Union conducted another large-scale air force exercise on the 8th, threatening the Berlin airlift. The news of the large-scale Soviet air force exercise was formally notified to the US Air Force Command by the Soviet side in a written statement, stating that the Soviet Union will conduct exercises in the airspace over Berlin and within the three Western air corridors from September 6 to September 15. The exercises in the corridor area will be as low as treetop level and as high as 6,000 feet, while those over Berlin will be between 9,000 and 36,000 feet.</p>
<h3>Fifteen Countries Reach Agreement on West German Tariff Issue</h3>
<p>[US Information Service, Washington, 7th] Of the 22 countries that signed the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, which are currently meeting in Geneva, 15 countries have reached an agreement on the point of not discriminating against trade with West Germany. The procedure proposed by the United States will grant West German territory the most-favored-nation status, as agreed upon by the signatory countries of the General Agreement.

<h3>Albania Claims Greek Planes Crossed Border to Drop Bombs</h3>

<p>[Agence France-Presse, Athens, 7th] It was officially announced that gendarmes discovered bandits digging underground water pipes in the suburbs of Athens last Sunday night, attempting to sabotage Athens' water supply. If the water pipeline is damaged, the drinking water for Athens' 1.5 million residents will immediately become a problem.</p>
<h3>Pravda Breaks Silence, Viciously Criticizes Southern Leader Tito</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, London, 8th] The Soviet newspaper had maintained silence on the Stalin-Tito discord, but this was suddenly broken by Pravda on the 8th. The newspaper accused Marshal Tito of "cruelly persecuting the majority of the Southern people who oppose his regime." The newspaper firmly denied the Southern claim that the Communist Information Bureau is launching a "campaign" against the Southern people and the majority of the Southern Communists, adding that we believe that the Southern people are our loyal allies. It is an undeniable fact that the majority of Southern Communist Party members still adhere to internationalist traditions, not Tito's nationalism. It also stated that Tito has been able to remain in power by implementing "brutal terrorist measures to suppress, collectively arrest, and murder comrades within the party."</p>
<h3>No Agreement Reached on Lifting Berlin Blockade, Four Governors' Meeting Stalls, West Protests Soviet Arrest of German Police</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Berlin, 7th] The four Allied military governors in Germany, namely Clay of the United States, Robertson of Britain, Koenig of France, and Sokolovsky of the Soviet Union, began their meeting at 4:04 pm today and ended at 9:55 pm. After the meeting, it was officially hinted that the four governors had failed to reach an agreement on the details of lifting the Berlin blockade. It was also stated that the meeting would not be reconvened, at least until new instructions were received from their respective governments.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Berlin, 8th] The West delivered a strong protest to the Soviet side this afternoon regarding the Soviet betrayal and arrest of 19 German police officers on the evening of the 7th. The protest was delivered directly to Sokolovsky by French military governor Koenig, and its contents are unknown. The Berlin City Council held a special meeting in the British sector on the evening of the 8th to protest the Soviet detention of German police officers. The Soviet news agency stated that the 22 German police officers arrested at the US Liaison Office on the evening of the 6th "are still under constant interrogation by the Soviet side."</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Berlin, 8th] The battle for the Berlin City Hall has ended, and the Soviet side has arrested another 19 German police officers from the Western sector. These 19 German police officers were originally stationed at the City Hall, and the Soviet side tricked them into leaving under the pretense of granting safe passage. Ten minutes later, as the 19 people were being transported to the French sector in French military trucks under French protection, they were all detained by the Soviet army.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Berlin, 7th] The tense situation in Berlin has eased after the Soviet side lifted its siege of the City Hall today. The Soviet side had banned anyone from passing through the area for the past four hours. The Soviet Union ordered its 常備軍警衛隊 and German police to withdraw from the vicinity of the City Hall and allowed the Germans inside to leave.</p>
<h3>Granddaughter of the Late Roosevelt Marries American-Born Soviet Officer</h3>
<p>Age Difference of One and a Half Times</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, New York, 7th] Edith, the 20-year-old granddaughter of the late President Roosevelt, will soon marry Barming, a 49-year-old former Red Army Brigadier General. Barming was previously a member of the Communist Party and served as the Soviet Chargé d'Affaires in Athens in 1937. He later fled to the United States and officially became an American citizen in 1943.</p>
<h3>US, Britain, and France Agree to Soviet Proposal to Convene Four Foreign Ministers Conference in Paris to Discuss the Issue of Italian Territories</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, London, 8th] The British government has now agreed to the Soviet proposal to convene a foreign ministers' conference to consider the future of the former Italian colonies as stipulated in the Italian peace treaty before September 15. Britain has also suggested Paris as the venue for the conference.</p>
<p>[This newspaper's report] Washington, 8th, broadcast: The United States and France will follow Britain in sending notes to the Soviet Union, accepting the Soviet proposal to convene a four-power foreign ministers' conference to discuss the issue of the former Italian colonial mandate territories.</p>
<p>[This newspaper's report] Washington, 8th, broadcast: Marshall stated at a press conference today that the US response to the Soviet proposal to convene a foreign ministers' conference to address the issue of Italian territories will be delivered to the Soviet ambassador on the afternoon of the 8th and will be released at the same time. When asked whether the US would accept the proposal, Marshall declined to answer. However, other sources said that both the US and France generally accepted the proposal.</p>
<h3>Soviet Union Detains Japanese Prisoners of War for Military Service, MacArthur Raises Serious Protest, Soviet Representative to the Allied Control Council Takes a Reserved Attitude</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Tokyo, 8th] MacArthur Headquarters has raised a serious protest with the Soviet authorities over the repatriation of Japanese prisoners of war in accordance with the stipulated monthly quota. A spokesman for MacArthur Headquarters revealed today that the letter of protest was sent on September 3 to Lieutenant General Terentii Shtykov, the Soviet representative on the Allied Council for Japan. According to reliable information obtained by MacArthur Headquarters, there are still more than 500,000 Japanese prisoners of war detained by the Soviet Union for their slave labor. The spokesman said that the Soviet Union is forcing these Japanese to work in munitions factories, aircraft construction sites, and mines. The spokesman also said that MacArthur Headquarters is extremely concerned about the Soviet Union's enslavement of Japanese prisoners of war in its controlled areas to increase the Soviet Union's military potential. He pointed out that the US Military Headquarters had requested the Soviet side to regularly repatriate 160,000 people per month a year ago, but the Soviet representative ignored this request and did not reply. According to recent US estimates, the number of Japanese prisoners of war detained in the Soviet Union is still as high as 523,316.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Tokyo, 8th] A spokesman for Lieutenant General Terentii Shtykov, the Soviet representative on the Allied Control Council for Japan, told the Associated Press on the 8th that Mr. Shtykov would temporarily refrain from commenting on the Allied Headquarters spokesman's criticism that the Soviet Union was enslaving 500,000 Japanese prisoners of war and forcing them to perform hard labor. He added that Mr. Shtykov needed time to study the accusation before stating his position. Diplomatic circles believe that the Allied Headquarters spokesman's offensive has given the United States the upper hand in the Cold War propaganda offensive in the Far East. Observers believe that the facts and figures listed in MacArthur's letter to Mr. Shtykov on September 3 accusing the Soviet Union of violating the agreement leave the Soviet side with no words to answer. However, the Soviet Embassy here will surely launch a counterattack after consulting with Moscow.</p>
<h3>South Korean Conservative Party Ceases Overthrow Cabinet Movement</h3>
<p>Continued Infighting Will Inevitably Lead to Mutual Destruction</p>
<p>[New Asia News Agency, Seoul, 8th] The South Korean Lee cabinet has faced domestic and international criticism and dissatisfaction due to its special circumstances and hasty establishment, which has made President Lee quite difficult. If the cabinet is reorganized or replaced, the new government's domestic credibility will be completely lost, and the international impression will also be unfavorable. The impact will be serious for the upcoming United Nations General Assembly in Paris and the recognition of Korean independence by various countries. To this end, President Lee has consulted with leaders of the Korean Democratic Party and the Society for Expediting Korean Independence on compromise issues. Recently, both the Korean Democratic Party and the Society for Expediting Korean Independence have decided to cease the overthrow cabinet movement from the 6th and adopt a cooperative attitude. The change in attitude of the Korean Democratic Party and the Society for Expediting Korean Independence also has its own inevitable difficulties. If the conservative forces in South Korea continue to engage in internal strife, they will inevitably head towards mutual destruction. Observers speculate that it is not impossible for the Lee cabinet to maintain itself for another three or four months, or even longer.</p>
<p>[US Information Service, Songgong Lake, 7th] A subcommittee of the United Nations Temporary Commission on Korea began drafting part of the commission's report to the United Nations General Assembly today.

<h3>Marshall to Depart for Paris on the 19th, Expresses Concern over French Political Situation</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 7th] A US State Department spokesman said that Secretary of State Marshall will lead a delegation to depart for Paris on the 19th of this month to attend the United Nations General Assembly.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 7th] A semi-official source said tonight that regardless of how the French political situation evolves, Secretary of State Marshall will personally attend the UN General Assembly. The source declined to comment on the resignation of French Prime Minister Schumann, but expressed hope that France would have a more stable government when the UN General Assembly opens. The New York Times recently pointed out in an editorial that the cabinet crisis in France does not indicate a lack of stability in French administration. Administrative affairs are carried out by fixed officials, and France will eventually make the government more stable.</p>

<p>Endless Shame, Avoiding the Camera</p>
<p>When the bailiffs escorted them out of the court, Zhan and Huang were grouped together. When the photographer took their picture, Zhan slightly lowered his head, seemingly endlessly ashamed. Huang had a worried look on his face. Wu Xilin hunched over at the waist and stayed (behind) Zhan and Huang to avoid being photographed. The bailiffs then put Zhan and the other three into a prison van and drove them to the Yangshupu Special Court detention center.</p>
<p>Yesterday was only a preliminary investigation. There was solid evidence for the hoarding and profiteering part, and Zhan and others did not deny it. After several more investigation sessions, the case can be closed.</p>

<h3>Dai Mingli Visits Operating Authorities, Requests Thorough Investigation of Newspaper Reports, Denies Colluding with Banks to Resist Orders</h3>
<p>[Our Report] After a local evening newspaper published a report yesterday about Dai Mingli, the former Director of the Currency Department of the Ministry of Finance, "contacting merchants and banks to evade large amounts of foreign exchange," reporters from this newspaper separately visited Xu Baiyuan, Lin Chongyong, and Dai Mingli to seek the truth. Vice Minister Xu said at the time that he was not aware of the reported matter of coming to Shanghai to handle Dai Mingli inciting merchants and banks to evade foreign exchange. His trip to Shanghai was only to guide commercial banks in transferring foreign exchange deposits, and there were no other tasks. Director Lin Chongyong said: He had asked Supervisor Jiang about this matter, and Jiang said that his visit to the capital to see the President was not for this matter. The Gold Control Bureau itself had not heard of this matter either. Dai Mingli himself stated: The newspaper’s report about him mentioned three points: taking advantage of his position to approve the establishment of banks and businesses for personal gain, engaging in corruption in the gold case, and devising ways for commercial banks in the city to evade foreign exchange assets. Regarding the first point, the Currency Department was only a forwarding agency, and the final decision-making power rested with the higher authorities. Whether a bank or business was approved or not was not something he could decide based on his personal feelings. As for the statement that a bank could be approved even with a capital of only one yuan, it referred to the conversion of pre-war currency into gold yuan. For example, the pre-war capital of the Siming and Tongshang Banks was 4 million each, which is now only a little more than 1 yuan and 3 jiao when calculated in gold yuan. Regarding the gold corruption case, it caused a stir in the wartime capital, and after investigation and judgment by the relevant authorities, he was not involved. There are files available for verification for the above two points. As for the accusation that he colluded with commercial banks in Shanghai to resist the law, there is even less factual basis. The transfer work is currently proceeding smoothly, and Vice Minister Xu knows this best. He is only a member of the banking community and has no power to unite all banks to resist government laws. Moreover, he has served as a civil servant for many years and would never be so insane as to do such a thing. The so-called accumulated assets of 200 million US dollars, making him as rich as a country, is even more nonsensical. After this matter was reported, he immediately took the newspaper and went to see Mr. Jiang Jingguo, but he did not meet him because Jiang was in a meeting. He then visited President Yu of the Central Bank, Vice Minister Xu of the Ministry of Finance, and Director Lin of the Gold Control Bureau to request a thorough investigation. He is now waiting for the development of this matter and will not take any action for the time being. It is said that Supervisor Jiang is paying close attention to this matter and is also investigating.</p>

It is reported that the central government believes that in order to maintain the credibility of the gold yuan, commodity prices must be stabilized. Jiang's iron-fisted policy in Shanghai has received full support from the central government, so it is expected that all future measures will become more severe.</p>

<h3>Coins to Be Minted Next Month, Mint Ordered to Resume Work, Rushing to Repair Factory Buildings and Machines</h3>
<p>[Our Report] After the currency reform, the Central Mint in Shanghai was ordered by the Ministry of Finance to prepare to resume work and mint metal subsidiary coins. Wang Shouquan was appointed as deputy director to assist Director Wei Xianzhang in carrying out the resumption work. The factory was transferred to the interior during the Anti-Japanese War, and many boilers and machines were lost. The factory buildings were also in disrepair for many years. This sudden order to resume work has made the reorganization work very urgent. After receiving the order, Director Wei immediately gathered more than 40 old employees and more than 100 workers to rush to repair the factory buildings and replenish the machines, which is expected to resume minting work around mid-October. It is reported that the first coins to be minted will be half-yuan silver coins and one-fen copper coins. The design of the one-fen copper coin will be based on the pre-war half-fen design, with an ancient coin on the front and a national emblem on the back. Although several designs have been proposed for the half-yuan silver coin, the Ministry of Finance has yet to make a final decision.</p>

However, according to the Bureau's news yesterday, due to a typhoon at sea recently, there is no news of departure as of last night, so it is feared that it will not be able to return to Shanghai as scheduled. In addition, the Hai Lie ship will also be ordered to go to Osaka to load 4,000 tons of copper-nickel coins to return to the country. The ship is currently loading mineral sand at Yulin Port, and the Bureau has sent a telegram urging it to quickly sail to Osaka for loading.

<h3>Supply Bureau's Commissioned Stores Request Continued Allocation of Daily Necessities</h3>

At the same time, the original contracted sales stores of the Bureau have experienced a decrease in allocated goods and no allocation of daily necessities, so their business has recently become sluggish. According to a reporter from the distributors, they are extremely hopeful that the authorities of the Supply Bureau will distribute various daily necessities to the commissioned stores for sale, which can benefit the general public, enable the commissioned stores to continue to maintain their business, and quickly achieve the government's goal of selling materials to absorb wandering capital and suppress commodity prices.</p>
<h3>Deng Zhonghe Sued for Defamation, Files Counter-Suit in Court During Trial; Case of Reporting a Traitor Transferred to Another Jurisdiction; Zhu Zhengwen Submits a Statement of Objection</h3>
<p>[Our Report] The case of Zhu Zhengwen reporting Deng Zhonghe as a traitor was previously approved by the Shanghai High Prosecutor's Office to be transferred to the jurisdiction of the Zhejiang High Prosecutor's Office for investigation by the Supreme Court Prosecutor's Office. Zhu argued that Deng's past criminal facts and locations of activities were all in Shanghai, and it was appropriate to summon witnesses and obtain evidence locally. He has submitted a statement to the Supreme Prosecutor's Office objecting to the transfer of the case to another jurisdiction. Regarding Deng's publication of notices in various newspapers and public invitations to reporters, referring to Zhu as a "threatening bandit," Zhu separately filed a private prosecution with the local court for the crime of defamation. The case was tried by Judge Zhu Yuhuang of the local court at 2 p.m. yesterday. Zhu and Deng each appeared in court with their defense lawyers, and many relatives and friends of both parties attended the hearing. The defendant, Deng Zhonghe, stated: He made statements in newspapers such as Shen Bao, Xin Bao, and Qianxian Bao about the truth of the special donation for relief and Zhu's claim that he was a traitor. He claimed that there was factual basis for referring to Zhu as a "threatening bandit." In July and August of the 29th year, Zhu impersonated the commander of Su Yingzhong's team and sent him two letters. His wife and elder brother contacted Zhu at the Grand Theatre and Dasanyuan, and later paid 12,000 yuan at Zhu's home. He himself did not meet with Zhu. On June 26 and 30 of the following year, he received two more letters, which said, "If you don't pay, please don't regret it." He ignored them. He also claimed that Su Yingzhong's team had been disbanded in the 28th year, and Zhang Lei, whom Zhu referred to, also denied writing the letter. Zhu Zhengwen, the plaintiff, then testified, saying that he had served as a special agent in the Special Operations Office of the Former Military Affairs Commission's Detached Corps. Su Yingzhong's team was a peripheral unit organized by the Special Operations Office, and Zhang Lei was also a comrade. He came to Shanghai in the 29th year to carry out anti-traitor work. Although the Detached Corps was disbanded in the 28th year and the underground work was suspended, he obtained Zhang Lei's consent at the time to ask Deng for financial assistance, which was a patriotic act. As for the letters sent to Deng, two of them were written by Zhang Lei, and he did not know about the others. After the testimony, Deng filed a counter-suit against Zhu in court, with the following reasons: (1) Slander: Zhu accused me of being a traitor and providing funds to the enemy because there are three at 34 Bailinan Road, one of which is the Japanese Toyota Yarn Factory, and Zhu insisted that my factory was the Japanese factory. (2) Extortion by forging a name, (3) Fabricating a letter from Wan Lilang to falsely accuse a traitor. The court ordered a postponement for investigation of the case.</p>

<h3>"Femme Fatale" Unhappy After Marriage, Falls in Love with Storyteller, Both Are in Police Bureau</h3>
<p>[Our Report] Cheng Qingtong, a Suzhou native who runs a fancy goods business, met Li Ming, a dancer nicknamed "Femme Fatale," at the Lidu Ballroom last year. They were engaged in Shanghai on March 10 of the same year and married at his home at 65, Miaotang Lane, Suzhou on June 5. Three months after the marriage, the "beauty" was unwilling to stay at home, and their relationship gradually became estranged. In the third month of this year, Li used the excuse of visiting relatives in Shanghai and was unwilling to return to Suzhou. Despite repeated urging, she ignored them. Later, in August, Li Ming returned to Suzhou and took away all the valuable clothing and accessories. Cheng chased her to the station, but failed to persuade her to stay. After Li came to Shanghai alone, her whereabouts were unknown. Until recently, Cheng read in the newspaper that Li had changed her name to Liu Ruiqing, still worked as a dancer at the Metropolitan, and lived in room 418 of the Xinxin Hotel on Nanjing Road. He also learned that she had already had an affair with Zhu Xiaoxiang, who sang and told stories at the Cangzhou Shuchang and Xinxianlin. Cheng then reported to the Laozha Police Station yesterday morning, and they sent officers to go with him to the residence at the Xinxin Hotel. The door was locked from the inside, and they were still sleeping soundly. When they opened the door, the two were speechless. Because the case involved adultery, they were taken to the bureau for questioning, and many valuable clothing and accessories were recovered. (The picture shows Li Ming being detained at the police station. Photo by this newspaper)</p>

<h3>Family Massacre on Fenyang Road: Sick Husband Kills and Injures Five; Liu Zhixiong Arrested on the Spot; Mother Provides Three Reasons</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] At around 8:45 AM yesterday, a major family homicide occurred at No. 64, Alley 64 (Bixunfang) on Fenyang Road, the home of Liu Yintang, the owner of the Huaqi Import and Export Company. Five people were killed or injured, and the perpetrator, Liu Zhixiong, was arrested on the spot. The details of the case are complex and are reported as follows:</p>
<p>Liu Yintang, the 38-year-old owner of Huaqi Import and Export Company on Sichuan Road, Nanjing Road, is from Zhongshan County, Guangdong Province. He currently resides at No. 6, Bixunfang, Fenyang Road. His father, Liu Yijia, is over seventy years old, and his mother, Li, is sixty-one years old. He has a wife, Liu Xiao Ru, and several children. The family of seven or eight lives harmoniously. Yintang has a paternal uncle, Liu Yu Zhai, also known as Liu Ruxiang, who served as the Director of the Business Bureau of the puppet Central Reserve Bank during the enemy occupation. In his youth, Liu relied on his uncle's support and his career flourished, bringing the family to a comfortable level. Yu Zhai had a son named Zhixiong, also known as Guohan, who is 27 years old. He was spoiled and extravagant from a young age. He attended Datong University but later suffered from lung disease and stayed home to recuperate.</p>
<p>During the enemy occupation, Liu Yu Zhai used his position to accumulate considerable wealth and acquired numerous properties. After the victory, Liu was arrested and transferred to the High Court on charges of treason, sentenced to fifteen years in prison, and most of his real estate was confiscated. Afterward, Liu's second wife, Liu Zheng Yingrou, moved with Zhixiong and seven or eight other family members to No. 139, Anhe Temple Road. Their daily expenses relied on the support of his nephew, Liu Yintang. Zhixiong suffered from lung disease and stayed at Zhongshan Hospital for several months. After doctors performed surgery and removed four ribs, he recovered, but his body had not yet fully recovered, and all medical expenses were borne by his cousin, Yintang.</p>
<p>Liu Zhixiong started a business after being discharged from the hospital, but unfortunately, he had no luck and accumulated a large debt. He repeatedly asked Yintang for loans, but his requests were not granted, causing him resentment. He also learned from rumors that his father had hidden one hundred gold bars with Yintang before his arrest, and he repeatedly demanded their return, which fueled his hatred and led him to consider murder. At around 8:45 AM yesterday, Zhixiong hid a grenade and a US military knife and waited at the back door of No. 6, Bixunfang, Fenyang Road. Soon after, Yintang went out the back door to go to work. He stepped forward, grabbed his suit, and said, "I have a grenade hidden on me. Let's go inside and talk." As soon as he finished speaking, he pulled out the grenade. Yintang's wife, Liu Xiao Ru, heard the noise and looked out, seeing Ke Xiong trying to drag Yintang through the back door. She quickly tried to stop him, but Zhixiong pushed her to the ground.</p>
<p>Liu Yintang saw an opportunity and ran away. Unexpectedly, Zhixiong threw the grenade. With a loud bang, shrapnel flew everywhere. Wu Chengheng, who was delivering bread, had his nose blown off. Liu and his wife were spared. At this point, the perpetrator disregarded everything and went straight to the third floor. He saw Liu's mother, Li, holding her granddaughter, Liu Nanqiong (two years old), and took out the US military knife, stabbing Li in the chest, penetrating her back. She fell to the ground and died, and the girl was also stabbed in the head. He returned to the second floor and saw Liu's father, Yijia, in the outhouse, and stabbed him in the left abdomen. Seeing the terrible disaster he had caused, the perpetrator, fearing punishment, stabbed himself in the left abdomen. His right foot was also injured by shrapnel, and he collapsed.</p>
<p>After receiving the report, the Changshu District Police Branch, led by Chief Yan Chengsheng and Deputy Chief Yan Xianghu, rushed to the scene with Criminal Section Chief Ren Gongqin and Patrol Officers Zhao Yulin and Huang Yujun. Subsequently, Xia Lian, the Commander of the 3rd Brigade of the Garrison Headquarters, also arrived with Squad Leader Yan Jinwen after hearing the news. They immediately called for ambulances to send the injured to the Red Cross Hospital for treatment. The body of the deceased, Liu Li, was transported to the Tongren Fuyuan Hall Mortuary for examination. The perpetrator was sent directly to the Police Academy. The branch then summoned the perpetrator's stepmother, Liu Zheng Yingrou, for questioning. According to her statement, there were three reasons for Zhixiong's murderous intentions: (1) He suffered from stage three lung disease and had asked Liu's father, Yijia, to inform Yintang of his request for a large sum of money to treat the disease, but his request was not granted. (2) After Zhixiong was sent to Zhongshan Hospital for treatment, he insisted on staying in a first-class room, but Yintang refused, and he was discharged after several months. (3) Zhixiong had once requested a loan of 500 million legal tender, but only received 200 million. (This) caused this tragic family tragedy.</p>

<h3>The Magnificent Prospects of Pingxiang Coal</h3>
<p>— Our Newspaper Reporter, Liu Zao</p>
<p>In the next three years, Pingxiang Coal may become electrified and mechanized. The estimated daily coal production may reach 4,000 tons, and various native mines may also produce 1,000 tons of coal. In terms of transportation, 100 coal trains carrying 5,000 tons of coal per day will be needed, making it the most modern and largest coal mine in China. Therefore, Pingxiang Coal has a grand and beautiful future.</p>
<p>Purchasing Native Mines and Carrying Out Repairs</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report from Nanchang, 5th via Airmail] The initial planning for postwar reconstruction is just the beginning of the future prospects. During the war, the Anyuan mining area fell into enemy hands, and locals seized the opportunity to open native mines. By the time the Jiangxi Coal Mine Bureau was established for postwar reconstruction, there were already over a hundred native mines. Although these native mines appeared to be operated by impoverished people relying on their own strength to earn a living in the coal pits, there were still malicious forces supporting them behind the scenes. These native mines had a significant impact on large-scale, planned, and systematic mining in the future. After several discussions with the native mine operators, the mining bureau reached an agreement, but the agreement was not fully implemented. Therefore, the mining bureau has now established a temporary engineering office in Anyuan to manage and assist in the mining of native mines and to purchase four larger native mines for repair and renovation, preparing to start mining operations.</p>
<p>Native Mining Methods: Three People Per Ton</p>
<p>When the Gaokeng Mine was rebuilt after the war, coal was first extracted from the existing native mines, including the first, third, and Wangjia Yuan's 4.5 native mines. The total output is currently only a few dozen tons per day. The third mine is a larger adit, 180 meters long, with double-track railways for transportation. Inside, there is a 45-degree slope leading directly to the main coal bin. The top board inclined shaft is equipped with an electric coal hoist. Coal at the bottom of the shaft is hoisted by the coal hoist to the adit, loaded into mine carts, and then pushed by manpower along a light railway for 1.8 kilometers to the Baimiao Coal Plant. It is then unloaded into coal cars via a coal chute and transported via the Quangao branch line of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway to the Quanjia Yi'an station, then west to Zhuzhou and east to Nanhang. Currently, the coal produced in the third mine is only from the main coal seam. The mine has some mechanical equipment, but other mines almost all use native mining methods. Currently, over 1,500 miners work in three shifts, averaging one ton of coal per three people. In the future, the efficiency of mechanical mining can be increased threefold.</p>
<p>Drilling Progress Suddenly Doubles</p>
<p>The No. 1 and No. 2 main shafts at Changtangwei were continued after the war, but progress was slow due to insufficient power, progressing only 20 feet per month. In April of this year, with the addition of mechanical equipment, the drilling speed suddenly doubled. The diameter of the above-mentioned shafts is planned to be increased to 18 feet in order to achieve large-scale production in the future. The shafts are temporarily supported by wooden frames and will be lined with reinforced concrete in the future. The bedrock at the bottom of the shaft is drilled using a compressed air drill for one and a half hours, to a depth of about three to four feet, and then explosives are used. On average, drilling takes about three hours, while hauling stone slag and water takes five hours. The hoisting equipment consists of electric winch cars that raise and lower 14-cubic-foot iron buckets. The project, including bottom progress and ground work, involves 14 workers and one engineer per shift, with a monthly progress of about 45 feet.</p>
<p>Power Equipment Trending Towards Electrification</p>
<p>In terms of power equipment, the coal plant is currently working hard to electrify in order to save manpower and increase production. Near the new shaft at Changtangwei, a 50-horsepower electric winch, a compressor with a capacity of 315 cubic feet per minute, and a 75-kilowatt diesel engine were added in April of this year. About one mile from the new shaft, in a place called Xiaochong, there is a temporary power plant and a small repair shop with two 200-KVA generators, supplying electricity to the entire plant. The plant performs ordinary repairs and is equipped with ordinary parts, but the equipment is simple and insufficient.</p>
<p>Installing New Machines in Preparation for Trial Electrification</p>
<p>The power plant at Quanjia Yi'an is being built in a barren mountainous area. The engineer in charge of the project is Chen Bangshu, the young, dark-skinned director of the Electrical Engineering Department of the Jiangxi Coal Mine Bureau, and his large straw hat fully demonstrates his perseverance and hard work. I met him for the first time in Quanjia, and my only impression was that he was straightforward, sincere, and hardworking. The new machinery at the Quanjia Yi'an power plant has been installed, and they are working day and night to complete the installation. The technicians are afraid of the heat of the machines on hot days, so they work early in the morning or in the evening to speed up the work. When I left Quanjia, they were preparing to test the electricity. Because the construction of the factory building will take some time, it was decided to generate electricity in the open air first to supply electricity to the entire mine.</p>
<p>The Quanjia Yi'an power plant is a large family because they have named this reclaimed land Quanjia New Village. The families of the employees all live together, organize their own food cooperatives, and cook their own meals. Men, women, and lively children all live and work together, and the atmosphere is warm and harmonious.</p>
<p>Mass Production Plans Have Been Determined</p>
<p>Plans for large-scale production at the Gaokeng Coal Mine have been determined. For large-scale production, the No. 1 and No. 2 vertical shaft projects at Changtangwei are planned to be expanded to a diameter of 18 feet. The total depth of the shafts will be about 950 feet. Stone doors will be opened at 625 feet and 950 feet to connect the coal seams. No. 1 vertical shaft will be equipped with two cages, which will be raised and lowered by a 600-horsepower electric winch, specifically for raising and lowering stone slag, materials, and workers. No. 2 vertical shaft will be equipped with two seven-ton coal hoists, which will be raised and lowered by a 1,200-horsepower electric winch. The coal loading under the coal hoist and the unloading at the wellhead are all automatic, without the need for manpower.</p>
<p>New Equipment Being Prepared for Implementation</p>
<p>In order to increase production and reduce manpower, the equipment in the well is being mechanized, and the design engineering for each item is nearing completion and will be implemented soon. The new machinery to be used in the well in the future includes three-ton coal carts (for loading and transporting coal), electric trains (for transporting coal under the well and on the ground), automatic stone loading machines (for loading stone slag or coal), duckbill transfer machines (for loading coal at the working face and transporting coal in the roadway), chain conveyors (for transporting coal in the roadway), compressed air drills (for opening bedrock roadways), coal car traction machines (for controlling coal car transportation), tipping cages (for automatic unloading of coal), cage angles (for controlling coal car entry into the cage), cage locks and safety equipment (for the No. 1 shaft hoist), coal hoists (for automatic unloading of coal), automatic electric pumps (for underground drainage), electric fans (for underground ventilation), signal controllers (for underground traffic control), and underground coal bins (for automatic opening and closing to control coal discharge).</p>
<p>This mechanical equipment is powered by electricity or compressed air and has all safety equipment to prevent accidents and dangers underground. They now have a hope: that in three years, the Gaokeng Mine will be able to achieve a daily coal production of 5,000 tons, becoming the most modern coal mine in the country.</p>
<h3>Qiantang River Tidal Bore Washes Away Haining Embankment: Houses Collapse and People Die</h3>
<p>— (Our Newspaper Reporter Liu Zao Photograph)</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report from Haining, 7th] With the arrival of the autumn flood season and the continuous torrential rains, the tidal bore of the Qiantang River has been surging for days, a rare occurrence in the past ten years. At around 2:00 AM on the 7th, the night tide surged, reaching a height of several feet. The embankments in various areas along the river in this county were destroyed, and countless houses and people were drowned, causing an unprecedented tragedy. According to preliminary investigations, the following has been determined: (1) In the Wengbu 15th Bao area, more than 30 thatched houses were washed away, over 10,000 pieces of boarding were swept away, and dozens of people were killed or injured. The exact number has not yet been determined. (2) In Yuanmu Township, 40 to 50 thatched houses were washed away, and 17 people died. The actual losses are still under investigation. (3) In the section from Nanshan Bridge to Dashi Bridge in the urban area, dozens of sections of the embankment were destroyed. The tidal bore entered the earthen dikes, washing away four thatched houses and injuring one person. (4) Approximately one Chinese mile of stone embankment from Sanliqiao to Siliqiao was destroyed. (5) The "Yi Gao," "Guan," "Xian," "Xiang," "Du," "Yi Yi Zhong," "Li," "Cheng," and "Meng" character sea dikes at Qilimiao have all been destroyed by the tidal bore. The upper half of the stone embankment in the area about six Chinese miles east of the Meng character dike has also been destroyed. In order to protect the safety of the embankment and the lives of the people in the seven districts, the local people have launched a petition to appeal to the provincial authorities for effective repairs as soon as possible. (6) One zhang of the "Hu" character stone embankment at Jiuli Bridge and the "Xian" and "Qian" character stone embankments have completely collapsed. The residents along the embankment are in a state of panic and are relocating. The local court dispatched personnel today to examine the corpses in various locations, and the county government is continuing its investigation and providing relief.</p>
<h3>Family Homicide Occurs in Jinan: Kong Chang Chops Wife Seven Times, Locks Door and Hangs Himself</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report from Jinan, 8th] Kong Chang, an employee of a certain military organization here, was dismissed five days ago due to the organization's downsizing. After losing his job, he faced financial difficulties and often argued with his wife, Zhang. At around 3:00 PM on September 6th, Kong was impulsively struck by a trivial matter and repeatedly chopped his wife's head seven times with a kitchen knife, causing her to bleed profusely. Fortunately, Zhang's mother and neighbors rescued her and rushed her to the Municipal Hospital for emergency treatment. Due to the severity of her injuries, she was still not out of danger by the evening. However, what followed was even more tragic: while neighbors were sending her to the hospital, Kong took advantage of the lack of attention, locked himself in the room, and hanged himself with a rope. By the time the nearby police heard the news, broke down the door, and entered, he had already died.</p>
<h3>Tragic Car Accident in Qingdao: Ziguang and Song Zhesheng Killed</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report from Qingdao, 8th] Ziguang, a famous singer in Qingdao, died in a car accident yesterday afternoon while returning from the airport after seeing off a guest. Six soldiers were with her, two died and four were injured. Another deceased person was Song Zhesheng, a lieutenant colonel officer of the Air-Ground Liaison Team. The cause of the accident is said to be a collision with a US military vehicle. Both the Chinese and US sides are jointly investigating.</p>
<h3>Re-Survey of the Fujian-Jiangxi Railway Completed: Tunnels Planned in Jiangxi Province</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report from Shangrao, 6th] The re-survey of the Fujian-Jiangxi Railway, previously divided into three lines, has been fully completed. The Jiangxi section of the route has also been decided by the Ministry of Communications to adopt the third line after the re-survey (starting from Yingtan, passing through Jinxi, Nancheng, and ending in Guangze), with a total length of 207 kilometers. It will be necessary to excavate ten tunnels at Huangshiling, Hongmenling, Linfengling, Jigongling, Tasha, and Shanguan Bishan, and to erect 41 large bridges. The most difficult section of the entire project is approximately 23 kilometers from Chating to Shanguan. Nie Zhaoling, the current Director of the Rao Xiang Section of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway Engineering Office, has been ordered to concurrently serve as the Director of the Nan (ping) Ying (tan) Section Engineering Office. Ge Fuxi has been appointed as the Captain of the first detailed survey team, Ji Xunhuang as the Captain of the second team, and Lu Huang as the Captain of the third team. It is said that the Ministry of Communications has designated the Yingtan to Nancheng section to begin construction first, reportedly to connect with the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway. Also, the western section of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway has been operating well since the opening of the transportation vehicles. However, there are currently over 20 kilometers of light rail weighing 25 pounds, which affects the speed of the vehicles. The railway bureau is currently transporting a large number of heavy rails and plans to complete the emergency repairs within half a month.</p>

<h3>Transfer of Foreign Exchange Assets to National Banks: Over Half of Shanghai Banks Have Reported; Vice Minister of Finance Xu Baiyuan Returned to Beijing by Overnight Train Yesterday to Report Back</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Preparations for the commercial banks' transfer of foreign exchange gold and silver to the Central Bank are expected to be completed today. The authorities have ordered commercial banks in the city to complete the reporting work by 12:00 noon today; the deadline for insurance companies, money shops, and trust companies to complete the reporting is 4:00 PM today.</p>
<p>Yesterday, about half of the more than 80 commercial banks in the city reported. Provincial and municipal banks are being handled in the same way as commercial banks. In consideration of practical needs, the deadline may be extended slightly. Foreign exchange assets of branches of various banks are also being reported by the head offices. The report list is to be signed and sealed by the managers of the various banks, money shops, and companies to show its solemnity. In the future, if any misconduct or misrepresentation is discovered, they will be held fully responsible. As Vice Minister of Finance Xu Baiyuan is scheduled to return to Beijing by overnight train last night to report back, the report list of money shops and companies will be received by the Financial Administration. They will be reviewed first in Beijing to determine whether they are accurate and reliable. Once the review work is completed, the total amount will be announced.</p>
<p>Yesterday, a reporter met with Vice Minister of Finance Xu Baiyuan and asked him to estimate the amount of the transfer. Mr. Xu politely declined, but said that the rumored amount of US$300 million was slightly too high. He also said that the transfer of foreign exchange to the Central Bank is not a donation. Within the scope approved by the government, commercial money shops can still use their foreign exchange assets. For example, importing production tools, purchasing gold yuan bonds, etc. The government will announce detailed measures in the future. Also, the transfer of foreign exchange will not cause losses to commercial money shops, and the cooperation between the government and the private sector will consolidate the credit of the gold yuan. Foreign exchange will no longer be traded on the black market, and commercial money shops will no longer be criticized by society for the black market.</p>
<h3>Few Arrivals, Stagnant Sales: Rice Market Continues to Decline; Flour Price Rises Slightly, Edible Oil Stable</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the rice market continued to decline. White japonica and early indica rice in both the North and South markets have retreated to the price limit. Although arrivals have decreased due to rain, sales are even more stagnant. Rice shops have weak appetites, and prices have finally declined. The market opened steady, but gradually weakened. White japonica in the North market was 20 yuan and 80 cents, a decrease of 20 cents. Early indica rice remained stable, and sheep indica rice fell by 33 cents. White japonica in the South market fell by 23 cents. High-quality milled indica rice and coarse milled indica rice each fell by 50 cents. However, white yuan rice and new japonica rice remained at the price limit due to scarce arrivals. Yesterday, arrivals in the South market were 784 dan, and 1,062 dan in the North market, for a total of 1,846 dan.</p>
<p>Flour</p>
<p>Rose slightly, but trading was calm. As the warehouse receipts were delivered before the deadline, the market is now dominated by spot sales. Also, due to the scarcity of supply from the factories, the market remains strong. Battleship flour opened very low at 7 yuan and 15 cents, but quickly rose to 7 yuan and 25 cents, a slight increase of 1 cent. Lao Che flour opened at 7 yuan and 55 cents, an increase of 5 cents. Red Bee flour did not trade. Jiancheng flour opened at 7 yuan and 25 cents. Miscellaneous brands varied slightly, but trading was very low. Bran remained at the price limit due to the lack of supply from the factories. Wheat remained unchanged at 10 yuan and 3 cents.</p>
<p>Miscellaneous Grains</p>
<p>The market situation has changed little, but the supply is still good. Soybean oil factories are taking in goods, and there are many transactions. New beans are being sold in this street, and some have been sold. Qingdao corn continues to be added, and the price is one dime. Buyers are also interested in sorghum, and trading is brisk, with around 400 packages being sold. Yuanmai sales are stagnant and have not opened. Green beans have little trading. Sesame is still trading at the limit. Buyers from Guangdong are not taking in peanuts, and the market is weak with few buyers.</p>
<p>Edible Oil</p>
<p>Stable and uneventful. Soybean oil factory prices remain at the previous day's level. Datong factory opened at 49 yuan and 70 cents, but spot prices at the close of the market weakened slightly by 30 cents due to the approaching deadline for the delivery of warehouse receipts. Other spot soybean oil prices also weakened slightly. Rapeseed oil remains at 46 yuan. The export of crude oil from Qingdao to the south has been banned, which has strengthened confidence, so it remains firm at the price limit. Refined crude oil is 59 yuan and 90 cents. Small cart sesame oil is also experiencing a feeling of shortage due to scarce stock and supply, with the price of small cart oil at 50 yuan per barrel. Buyers remain weak for soybean cake. The factory price remains at 4 yuan and 60 cents. As inventory is low, supply and demand are both scarce, and trading is light.</p>
<h3>Abundant Hemp and Cotton Production in Zhejiang Province</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] Mr. Wu Weijing, Deputy General Manager of the China Textile Construction Company, has returned from inspecting cotton and hemp planting in Hangzhou, Xiaoshan, Haining, Fengxian, and Minhang. According to him, the general situation is quite good, especially the hemp production this year, which is particularly abundant. It is estimated that Zhejiang Province can produce about 450,000 dan of cotton and 600,000 dan of hemp this year. However, there may be some difficulties in purchasing this year, as speculative capital has already gathered in the countryside.</p>
<p>Hemp production in Zhejiang Province is concentrated in the eastern part. The hemp seeds used this year were brought from India and Taiwan by the Textile Construction Company. The Indian variety yields about 7 dan per mu, while the mixed variety yields about 4.5 to 5 dan per mu, resulting in a doubled yield compared to last year. Cotton production has been affected by frequent rainfall in recent months, hindering boll formation. Local cotton varieties are the worst affected, yielding only 60-70 jin of seed cotton per mu. Improved cotton varieties were first introduced to Zhejiang Province last year but only account for 15% of the province's total cotton production. Although the yield per mu exceeds 100 jin, the impact on the overall yield increase is limited. It is hoped that the weather will turn sunny soon to prevent severe impact on cotton production.</p>
<h3>Artificial Silk Price Adjustment: Fully Calculated Based on Market Price</h3>
<p>Due to cost considerations, the Central Trust Bureau plans to calculate this week's artificial silk allocation price based on the full market price on August 19th. Therefore, before approval from the Shanghai District Materials Adjustment Committee, this week's allocation price will not be determined temporarily. However, collection will proceed at last week's listed price, and any difference will be collected later after the new price is determined. As for the allocation quantity this week, in addition to the original 30% allocation, a temporary quota increase of 30% will be added. The colors and patterns will be determined by the barter office after consultation and will still be the responsibility of each guild to directly coordinate and distribute and report.</p>
<h3>Stable Money Market Trend: Net Advance of Over One Million for Banks</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the city's money market trend was stable. Four banks and one treasury had a net advance of 1,140,000 in the exchange of bills among the money industry. Among them, the Central Bank had a net withdrawal of 80,000, the Bank of China had a net advance of 360,000, the Datong Bank had a net advance of 630,000, the Farmers Bank had a net advance of 50,000, the Central Trust Bureau had a net advance of 50,000, the Postal Remittance Bureau had a net withdrawal of 90,000, the Central Cooperative Treasury had a net advance of 220,000, commercial banks had a net withdrawal of 300,000 in large exchanges, 820,000 in small exchanges, and foreign banks had a total net withdrawal of 20,000.</p>
<h3>Bank Capital Increase Issue: Bank Association Reviewed Yesterday</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] The administrative Yuan has announced the measures for adjusting the capital of commercial banks. In order to study the practical issues of implementation, the Shanghai Banking Association has entrusted the practical working group of the Banking Association to conduct a review. The group held a meeting yesterday afternoon, and it is said that there were two opinions discussed: (1) It is quite difficult to transfer increased capital to state-owned banks. (2) Banks should increase their capital by one-tenth of the actual amount for each new branch established. The banking industry has some questions about this and plans to ask the Ministry of Finance for interpretation. After formulating its opinions, the group will submit them to the Banking Association for review before submitting them to the Ministry of Finance.</p>
<h3>Gold, Silver, and Foreign Currency Redemption: Statistics for Two Weeks</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] The total amount of gold, silver, and foreign currency redeemed by the Central Bank and other entrusted agents in the two weeks from August 23rd to September 4th is as follows: (1) Gold: 271,052 taels, 5 qian, 2 fen, 8 li.

<h3>Factories Selling Actively, Viscose Yarn Sales Stagnant, Cloth Transactions Dull, Morale Low</h3>
<p>Yesterday's cotton yarn market saw active sales from factories due to the still loose money market, while sales were stagnant, creating a situation of oversupply. The price of 20-count yarn once fell within the limit. Fine yarn supply in the market was limited as each yarn factory directly opened sales to the replication industry, but demand was also scarce, and the market atmosphere was peaceful. 42-count Jincheng yarn is currently sold at 1,033 yuan, and 21-count Shuangma yarn at 783 yuan, with transactions returning to normal.</p>
<p>Another report: After the authorities strictly controlled cotton yarn, more sales turned to Jinling Road, where yarn shops have been supplying at the limited price, with each person limited to buying a small package. At Xintai, Yongtaichang, China Yarn and Cloth Company, etc., people are lining up to buy.</p>
<h3>Zhongfang Selling Yarn</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] China Textile Construction Company sold yarn separately in the yarn market and at its company listing yesterday. A total of 384 pieces were sold in the market, receiving 271,488 yuan. Two types were opened: 20-count Shuangli and Hongfeng, both priced at 707 yuan. The company's listing sold a total of 972 pieces of various count yarns, equivalent to 1,865 pieces of 20-count yarn, earning 852,991 yuan.</p>
<p>The company opened 22 types of yarn, with the following prices: 20-count Hongkuixing and Feima both at 707 yuan, 6-count Fu Riguang at 255 yuan, 8-count Te Fengnian at 600 yuan, 10-count Lizhen and Fu Dong at 480 yuan, 10-count Shuanggu Fengnian at 528 yuan, 32-count Shuanggu Fengnian at 880 yuan, 40-count Riguang at 880 yuan, 42-count Lougu Riguang at 1020 yuan, 60-count Riguang at 1150 yuan, and 80-count Shuanggu TK Caiqiu at 2580 yuan.</p>
<h3>Silver Subsidiary Coin Exchange for Gold Yuan: Three Double-Hao Coins Exchange for One Yuan, Daily Discount for Silver Shops Revised to Two Yuan</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] The Central Bank's Business Bureau recently sent a circular to its branches, stating that the emergency decree on financial and economic measures already has provisions for the exchange of silver and silver dollars. However, there are no explicit provisions regarding the exchange of silver subsidiary coins for gold yuan. According to the previous regulation of exchanging 12 jiao in silver coins for one yuan, the method for exchanging gold yuan is determined by analogy. That is, three double-hao coins or six single-hao coins exchange for one gold yuan, to ensure uniformity.</p>
<p>It is also learned that the Central Bank's Audit Department recently sent a circular to its branches, stating that from September 1st, the Shanghai Silver Industry will revise the interbank daily discount to two yuan, and the loan daily discount to three yuan.</p>
<h3>Cotton Cloth Transactions Target Limited Door Shops and Cloth Wholesalers</h3>
<p>The cotton cloth market is increasingly uneasy as the authorities are strictly inspecting warehouses and storage facilities. Moreover, goods handled by out-of-town merchants cannot be smuggled. Therefore, some merchants from the north started selling at the beginning, and local shops and retail investors also came to sell. Many in the industry also closed out. Merchants from the Yangtze River region and Xuzhou and Bengbu regions rarely absorbed goods, and transactions were sparse. Dyeing factories, facing stagnant sales of colored cloth to avoid capital closure, turned to reselling white坯 cloth in the market.</p>
<p>Under the guidance of the authorities, brokers in the market only conduct transactions with door shops and cloth wholesalers. For numbered shops and guest houses, they are allowed to sell on their behalf but refuse to buy on their behalf. It is also reported that goods transported on the road must carry a transaction receipt for inspection. If it is found that the goods are being transported to a numbered shop, intervention will occur. Everyone is intimidated by the authorities' strict measures to suppress prices, and morale is low.</p>
<p>12-pound Longtou fine cloth was initially sold by Yongxin Cloth Shop at 29.3 yuan per piece for 600 pieces. Retail investors then engaged in mutual sales, dropping the price to 28.5 yuan, and finally to 28.8 yuan, a further decrease of 0.5 yuan from the previous day. Si Junzi Yuan Biji only dropped by 0.2 yuan due to brisk sales in the cool autumn. Jin Yun Miaowu Yuan Biji was sought after by Hankou merchants and remained steady at the original price of 27.6 yuan. Other cloths also retreated, with the biggest drop being 0.7 yuan for Laba B fine cloth.</p>
<p>Another report: Wufu B fine cloth, which is sold by Textile Construction Company every other day, is priced at 23.8 yuan, with each household allocated 40 pieces uniformly. Wansan bleached cloth is 26.8 yuan, with each household allocated 20 pieces. It is also learned that recently, door shops in the city, such as Rixinsheng, Xindaxiang, and Xiedaxiang, have been queuing up to sell limited-price cloth at 8:00 every morning, but the trademarks are still being cut off.

<h3>Tea Loan Increased Tenfold: Not Approved by the Authorities</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] This reporter recently met with Mr. Han, General Manager of Anhui Tea Company, who stated that the National Cooperative Goods Supply and Sales Office recently sent representatives to discuss the promotion of black tea produced by various cooperatives in Qimen this year. As a result, the Qimen Shawan Cooperative has reached an agreement and has sent Ma Xibai to Shanghai to oversee everything. It is reported that a large amount of goods will arrive soon.</p>
<p>It is also learned that the Tea Association here previously telegraphed the Four Joint Offices, requesting that the tea loan for this year be increased tenfold, to 80 million to 100 million yuan per dan, and that the deadline be extended to three months. Due to the authorities' implementation of emergency economic control policies, this has not been approved. However, tea merchants believe that tea is not only related to foreign sales but also sufficient to affect domestic production. Therefore, they plan to send representatives to the capital to request instructions and also seek to reduce the tea loan interest rate.</p>
<p>Yesterday's tea market saw stable domestic tea prices, while foreign tea varieties were in high demand with limited supply, and their prices were firm.</p>

<h3>Resettling Refugee Students from Secondary Schools in Bandit-Controlled Areas: Temporary Secondary Schools Should Be Run by Local Authorities; Expenses and Relief Funds Can Be Requested from the Ministry of Education</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, August 8th] A spokesperson for the Ministry of Education issued a written statement stating that the government has been setting up temporary secondary schools in various places to resettle refugee students from secondary schools in bandit-controlled areas. However, the nature of these temporary secondary schools is not well understood by the outside world, and there have been requests to convert them into national schools. According to regulations, secondary schools should be run by local authorities in principle. Therefore, after the victory of the war, the Ministry of Education has repeatedly followed the orders of the Executive Yuan to transfer over 30 national secondary schools established during the war to provincial and municipal governments. The remaining few national secondary schools are also being reorganized by local authorities according to the orders of the Executive Yuan due to special circumstances. As for the temporary secondary schools recently established in various places, the Ministry of Education has generally entrusted the education departments of various provinces and cities to manage them for the convenience of supervision and guidance. However, the required expenses and relief funds for refugee students from bandit-controlled areas can still be requested from the Ministry of Education for approval or fundraising. As for the temporary secondary schools of Yuzhou and Zhongyuan, which were temporarily established by the Ministry due to the urgent situation of Kaifeng being captured by bandits, the Henan Provincial Education Department has been ordered to send personnel to take over. The northeastern temporary secondary schools originally established in the Pingjin area have also been handed over to the Pingjin Municipal Education Bureaus for management.</p>

<h3>Mooncakes</h3>
<p>— Zhibai</p>
<p>It is truly autumn. The watermelon stalls along Nanjing Road have all disappeared. A few days ago, a red-paper-wrapped wooden sign proudly proclaimed "Authentic Package - Flat South Gate Watermelon". Today, the wooden sign is still wrapped in red paper, but the words have been changed to "Mooncakes on Sale." Children admire them, watching the hot ovens all around.</p>
<p>Suddenly, I recall that every year around the Mid-Autumn Festival, newspapers often feature timely articles discussing how expensive Mid-Autumn Festival gifts are, how business in shops has declined compared to previous years... and almost every year there is a sentence: "The largest mooncake at ×× Garden costs so much money, it's truly astounding!" I often wonder: Does anyone really buy these large mooncakes? Besides placing them on the table to elicit a compliment from guests, what's the point? There are many things that can be used to flaunt wealth, many things more clever and refined than such a large mooncake. Why bother with such a large and clumsy mooncake? When it comes to eating it, you need to "cut and slice," which is so inconsistent with the mood of a reunion dinner!</p>
<p>A few days ago, I saw a newly arrived Western magazine. In the white space on one page, it wrote: "Before you criticize the lunch menu for being too bad, please consider: At least a quarter of the world's population is starving to death!" At that moment, I was reminded of many things: the old and young refugee families begging on the streets, the students who fled the war zone begging in groups—and, indeed, I thought of the large mooncakes at ×× Garden. What is the highest price per mooncake this year, I wonder?</p>
<p>However, the newspapers say that the government has decided to urge people to practice thrift and strictly prohibit Mid-Autumn Festival gift-giving. Food stores are also not allowed to produce mooncakes in an extravagant and wasteful manner (roughly speaking).</p>
<p>This is indeed a very wise measure. However, relying solely on laws is not enough. The most important thing at present is that a simple and unadorned atmosphere must be thoroughly cultivated from top to bottom.</p>
<p>I have a friend who lives a very serious life. He doesn't drink, smoke, gamble, or dance. He is very responsible at work and is never late or early. However, his unexpected expenses every month are still considerable, and he is never the one to get promoted during the company's annual performance review. What are his unexpected expenses? It turns out that there is a very popular clerk in their company who remembers the birthdays of every manager, deputy manager, and their wives. When the time comes, he takes a big red hat and asks everyone to sign their names in order to give gifts. When the manager recently had a grandson, everyone immediately sent a congratulatory glutinous rice and ginger dish. When the deputy manager recently took a concubine, everyone immediately sent congratulatory gifts. My friend spends a third of his salary on this every month, but there is no way out, he can't escape! Perhaps because he hasn't been able to very happily and nicely take out money every time, the clerk, Zhang Sheng, secretly says behind his back that he "has no style!"</p>
<p>Their manager always advocates frugality and hard work, but he never opposes the gift-giving trend among his subordinates. He attaches great importance to everyone's "appearance," saying that it is "related to the company's reputation." The clerk often says that my friend "has little style," so the manager has heard about it over time. Since the impression is bad, my friend is out of luck.</p>
<p>In fact, I think every Shanghainese suffers to some extent because of the word "style." When I was in the inland areas, people didn't mind if I wore old clothes. At that time, I imagined that perhaps I could change the idea of "judging people by their clothes" if I went there. Who knew that when everyone came to Shanghai, the first thing they did was to make a lot of clothes! You make them, he makes them, everyone makes them, and as a result, you feel like you have to make them too. Do you have a lot of money? Not necessarily—"style" is important! As a result: in terms of the income of the average Shanghainese, if they are willing to be content with "plain clothes, warm food, and full stomach," they would probably be able to get by. However, they simply refuse to give up "style," so those who should wear blue cloth robes insist on wearing serge, and those who should eat one meat dish and two vegetable dishes insist on eating two meat dishes and one vegetable dish. They clearly earn a monthly salary of two hundred yuan, but their living expenses and everything else give others the feeling that they earn five hundred yuan a month, even if it means going into debt.</p>
<p>Take the large mooncakes at ×× Garden, for example. Is the taste of large mooncakes really that different from the inexpensive small mooncakes? The reason why a few "huge things" are inevitably produced every year is only to meet the needs of people who pursue "style."</p>
<p>I hope that when large mooncakes are banned, this "style concept" that harms people so much will also be thoroughly eradicated!</p>
<h3>Reading Uncle Fan's Inscription on Shen Yunying's Hand Scroll: Two Casual Poems</h3>
<p>— Huang Yunmei</p>
<p>How much heroism have these moth-like eyebrows seen? History's pen is unfairly biased. A generation's fame belongs to the stone mausoleum, who can truly tell of Shen Yunying? (The History of Ming, Biography of Zhang Xianzhong, states that Xianzhong attacked Daozhou, and the garrison commander Shen Zhixu died in battle. His daughter fought again to retrieve her father's body, saving the city, and so on.)</p>
<p>The remaining ink is sparse and uncommon, adding more melancholy to the rise and fall of dynasties. I feared it would fall into the hands of Mei Cun, but after three hundred years, I have finally met you.</p>
<h3>Feeling on the River Embankment</h3>
<p>— Ding Daoheng</p>
<p>The wind rushes, and catkins fly wildly along the riverbank, all sorts of quiet thoughts help to dispel my soul. What taste does spring have with orioles flying and grass growing? Pledges of love and mountains are dead, don't even mention them. The rippling stream tides still come morning and evening, the simple thatched cottages are still cold and warm. After ten years, I have thoroughly understood and held onto my wife, and have not received a bit of kindness from the Udumbara flower.</p>
<h3>Moonlight Bath and Other Things</h3>
<p>— Qifeng</p>
<p>The love of beauty is human nature; especially for women, they can hardly live without the word "beauty" in their lives. American women spend as much as 600 million U.S. dollars on cosmetics alone each year. In addition, the huge expenses in beauty salons are too numerous to count.</p>
<p>In fact, beauty is timeless; the "newest" beauty may be the "oldest" beauty.</p>
<p>Sunbathing has recently become extremely popular in the United States. They believe that it is not only beneficial to health, but also enhances beauty. In movies and magazines, we often see men and women wearing swimsuits and sunglasses, leisurely lying in the sun, tanning their skin a brownish-red color. But little do they know that sunbathing was very popular in Italy in the 15th century. At that time, a group of fashionable young women also liked to take moonlight baths in the quiet moonlight!</p>
<p>In recent years, many women like to comb their hair upwards, clamping it with hairpins, which is cool and comfortable, commonly known as "Taoist head." Little do they know that this new-style hairstyle was adopted by South American Indian women a long time ago. They rub sticky honey into their hair, and then apply iridescent or pearlescent fish scales to their hair to make it particularly bright and radiant.</p>
<p>How seductive it is to paint red or purple nail polish on fingernails or toenails! Some people say: This is truly an extraordinary expression of beauty; but these modern women who love to use nail polish are really lagging behind; we certainly know that ancient Chinese women knew how to use the petals of balsam flowers to dye their nails, making them emit a light red or deep red light.</p>
<p>Not long ago, an explorer excavated an ancient Peruvian tomb, in which was buried a female mummy. It is estimated that the woman was buried in the ground as early as a thousand years ago, but after he carefully observed it, this thousand-year-old female corpse was quite modern! - Her cheeks and lips were painted with rouge, her eyebrows were shaved off, her hair was short, and her fingernails and toenails were also dyed. There was also a cloth bag next to her, which contained the powder puff, hair tweezer, and a powder mirror box decorated with feathers that she used during her lifetime, as well as rouge, lipstick, and face powder!</p>
<h3>Each in Their Place</h3>
<p>— Rushi</p>
<p>One day, a French traveler in a small village in India suddenly discovered a very exquisitely carved Buddha statue. He asked the antique dealer who was selling the Buddha statue: "How much does it cost?"</p>
<p>He said, "Since you have come from afar, sir, I only want seventy-five rupees."</p>
<p>The traveler said, "Since that's the case, considering that I am a traveler from afar, let's say forty-five rupees.</p>
<p>The shop owner raised his hands to the sky and shouted: "Forty-five rupees! Are you kidding me! Won't others laugh when they hear that?"</p>
<p>The traveler said, "Forty-five rupees, no more.</p>
<p>The shop owner was furious and said: "No way. Since you want this thing, I'd rather give it to you as a gift."</p>
<p>The traveler reached out to take the Buddha statue and said: "I agree! You are really too polite. Thank you very much. However, as the saying goes, courtesy demands reciprocity, so I would also like to give you a small gift now, I hope you won't be angry?"</p>
<p>"Of course not angry!</p>
<p>"Okay, then here is my little gift. It's a total of forty-five rupees, just a token of my appreciation, please accept it."</p>
<p>The shop owner accepted the money, and the two polite gentlemen parted happily.</p>
<h3>Rainy Night</h3>
<p>— Diao Ying</p>
<p>The street lights on a rainy night seem to be sparser than usual. So scattered, three or two, dotting a few circles of amber light in the darkness. However, the wet road reflects these lights, but it seems like a winding golden ribbon is laid on the ground.</p>
<p>The people who were crowding by the roadside to enjoy the cool air a few days ago have been driven in by the rain, and the lights in the dormitory have all been turned off.</p>
<p>All that's left is the gentle sound of the rain, only the occasional rustle of my raincoat brushing against the plane tree, and otherwise: a piece of silence.</p>
<p>Suddenly, I saw a small bungalow in the dense flowers and trees, and a hint of light faintly revealed from the light purple curtain. Suddenly, I heard the quiet, slow sound of playing the piano.</p>
<p>Just as the lush green leaves are especially green in the rain, this fragment of piano sound seems to add a lot of beauty to this quiet street.</p>
<p>I gladly took a step. I know: the past is already past, and what should pass must pass. -- However, there is still this kind of helpless attachment, like it's stuck to my heart.</p>
<h3>Snippets of East and West</h3>
<p>— Cangyu</p>
<p>In the city of East Kesde in England, there is a glass hotel. The external walls, indoor floors, furniture, and doors and windows are all made of glass of various colors. The walls are also carved with extremely large murals, and the floor is paved with non-slip square patterned glass, arranged into various pleasing patterns. When sunlight shines, the light is reflected from all directions, bright and dazzling, making it a spectacle.</p>
<p>Recently, the Czech Republic invented a kind of "West Long" stockings. This new glass stockings has begun to be sold in Prague, Czech Republic. According to the inventor's wife, she wears them and washes them every day, and a pair of West Long stockings not only doesn't break after being worn for 400 consecutive days, but also doesn't run, which is much more durable than American nylon stockings.</p>
<h3>Talking about Fuqing Pears</h3>
<p>— Feng Chaoran</p>
<p>Lu Ziyan followed me in his youth for nearly thirty years. He has fully mastered the arts, but he doesn't flaunt himself. He lives in seclusion in Fuqing Dock in Wukang, opens up land for farming, and plants a thousand pear trees. During the Dingchou Rebellion, his family fled west. Upon victory, he returned from Shu. He looked after his old home, but the house had been reduced to ashes. However, the pear trees he planted long ago had grown tall and spread their canopies, forming a forest that stretched as far as the eye could see. So he weeded the wasteland, loosened the soil, and fertilized it. Within a year, they bore fruit. The pear species are carefully cross-bred, resulting in new and unique varieties. Although the Laiyang and Mashan varieties are famous, they are not accustomed to the southern soil. Moreover, due to the obstruction of Qingxu soldiers, merchants cannot travel, which has caused the taste to be absent from Nanjing for a long time. This then possesses the advantage of possessing the properties of the land, and its excellent quality makes the mouth feel cool and refreshed, and the teeth feel ice-cold, how could it be worse than those from Laiyang and Mashan? In the past, Pan Heyang praised the pears in Zhang Gong's Valley because Zhang Gong was a recluse, so the object was valued because of the person. Now, Yanshao is indifferent to fame and profit, hides his light, builds a house on the green cliff, and works the eastern fields with a hoe. He possesses thousands of wooden slaves [pear trees], similar to the five-colored melons of the marquis, compared to ancient virtuous men, how could he be ashamed? I already admire Yanshao's character, and also believe that the precious and unusual should not be hidden for long, so I write this article to promote it. Those who know the taste should believe that I am not favoring his private interests.</p>
<h3>The Soul of the Awned Meat</h3>
<p>The National Assembly of the new Republic of Korea passed the "Punishment of Pro-Japanese Collaborators" Act. Because its history is long and the situation is particularly serious, the first article allows it to be traced back to those who signed the treaties of protection and annexation. Forty years later, the "not very elegant" names of those who destroyed the country reappear, which is lamentable.</p>
<p>During the Jiawu War, although Japan defeated the former Qing, it still promoted the independence of Korea. Moreover, Russia competed with it. Until the end of the Jiachen War, with the Park-Maoji Treaty, Russia recognized all of Japan's special rights. Japan then gradually expanded its voracious mouth. First, Hayashi Gonsuke and the Korean Minister of Foreign Affairs signed the so-called Japan-Korea New Agreement, defining Korea as a "protectorate" and taking away its diplomatic rights. All foreign affairs were handled by Japanese representatives, in order to eliminate its international status. Then, the Governor-General's Office was established, with Ito Hirobumi as the Governor-General, which was actually the same as a supreme government. Later, due to the Hague Secret Envoy Incident, Korea was forced to cede the throne to the crown prince, disband the army, and all military and political power in the country was transferred to Japan, with only a nominal position remaining. Until 1910, with the "petition" of the so-called "Ilgwan Society," the merger was completed. In total, there were four important stages, each stage with its treaty, and each treaty with its signing ministers. At that time, Japan used both coercion and inducement, and it may not have all come from their hearts. Now that the new country has been established, in order to wash away the accumulated shame and blame the past, it cannot but do so. As for who is guilty and what their crime is, we don't need to comment. However, the opposite of "traitor" is "loyal." There are people who are shameless and humiliate the country, and there are also those who resist and sacrifice their lives. Praising loyalty and righteousness and setting an example for the people is not limited to either side.</p>
<p>Liang Rengong had a Korean elegy in the Gengxu year, which said, "Of the ten million Koreans, I see two men. Their livers should be offered in martyrdom, and their spirit of assassinating Qin does not decay." The original note said, "A year before the fall of Korea, the righteous man Ahn Jung-geun assassinated the former Governor-General Ito Hirobumi in Harbin and killed him. He was arrested and calmly faced death. Three days after the fall of Korea, Hong Sang-won, the magistrate of Geumsan County in Chungcheongnam-do, died by self-immolation." According to this, these are the two people that Rengong remembers with particular depth. In fact, there are definitely more than just "two men" among the martyrs who sacrificed their lives throughout the years. For example, during the disbandment of the Seoul army, Park Seong-hwan, the commander of the First Regiment, refused to obey the Japanese order and committed suicide with a pistol. His troops fought a great battle with the Japanese soldiers at the southwest gate, falling one after another, with more than two hundred casualties, and also killing dozens of Japanese generals and soldiers. There are many unknown heroes in this heroic scene. Also, in the Hague Incident, the two Mr. Lis traveled far across the ocean, making "Qin court cries," but crying to no avail, they committed suicide one after another. After Japan annexed Korea, during the restoration movement, there was no lack of zealous and heroic figures who ran around for thirty or forty years. As for Yin Bong-gil, who annihilated the major invaders of China with a single bomb in Shanghai in 1932, Rengong had already passed away and did not see or hear about it.

<h3>"Safety First" Please strengthen traffic control by the police authorities</h3>
<p>The streetcar driver deliberately crashes into a tricycle</p>
<p>Dear Editor: Around 7:30 PM on September 2nd, I took the No. 20 streetcar home at the Yu Road Jiangsu Road intersection. When the streetcar approached Yuguang Village on the same road, I suddenly saw a tricycle slowly moving on the sidewalk in front of the streetcar. There were ten passengers on the tricycle. At that time, the streetcar was only about two feet away from the tricycle, but the driver did not brake, but planned to accelerate and pass on the outside. However, because the distance was too close, it crashed straight from behind. The passengers on the tricycle were thrown out more than ten feet, and were crushed by the car a few seconds later. This made me think about the issue of urban traffic safety. Now I have a few suggestions that I would like to discuss with everyone;</p>
<p>(1) For the streetcar company authorities: Streetcar accidents can be said to have left a deep impression on Shanghai citizens. The reasons for this are nothing more than the streetcar drivers' poor skills and lack of training, and the old vehicles. The company authorities should bear 100% responsibility for these points and should pay attention to them anytime and anywhere.</p>
<p>(2) For the public utility authorities: In Shanghai, most drivers of motorized vehicles are only allowed to be hired after passing the public utility bureau's examination. Streetcar drivers should not be an exception, and should be more strictly restricted in the future, so as not to allow those with poor skills to mix in.</p>
<p>(3) For the police authorities: I hope that the safety campaign that was implemented before can be held once every quarter (the time is set for one week). In order to raise the vigilance of drivers, and to strictly enforce the ban on speeding of motor vehicles and the observance of traffic rules. Respectfully, Zhu Yi'wu</p>
