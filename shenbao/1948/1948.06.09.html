<h3>監察院今選舉院長　于右任民當選希望最高　曹浩森決競選副院長·趙守鈺已放棄</h3>
<p>〔本報南京八日電〕第一屆監院監委互選院長定九日晨舉行，院長呼聲最高之前任監院長于右任委員，業於八日上午十一時一刻赴報到處報到。衆信院長之選舉，於第一次投票中即可決定。選舉大會之會堂已佈置就緒，委員投票分四區進行，票匭兩個、採取當塲開票之辦法，選票為八開宣紙對摺，上列政府公佈當選之全體委員名單，其餘各項手續則仍循國大選舉總統之方式進行。投票監察員及開票監察員均已於八日第二次預備會議巾推定。</p>
<p>至競選監院院長者，除于右任外，尙朱聞有第二人。而副院長之競選人則日有增加，除劉哲·田烱錦·陳肇英·張維翰·王冠吾·梅公任·簫一山·呂超·崔電華（女）外，據悉：曹浩森頃發表渠決參加競選，各競選人對提名事，紛作暗中活動。另固擬　加競選副院長之趙守鈺，八日在預備會中，當衆宣佈放棄，其最大原因在於競選者太多，票子分散，為集中意見，為節省時間，渠決定放棄競選。同時渠尙提出為副院長之條件應年富力强，而渠自稱條件不够。未並環顧四周，行一鞠躬禮，表示謝意。</p>
<p>〔本報南京八日電〕第一屆監察院監察委員集曾第二次預備曾犧，八日晨九時一刻舉行，出席監委一二二人，劉哲主席，通過（一）監察院監察委員互選院長副院長辦法草案。（二）監委互選院長·副院長投票及開票辦法草案。（三）監委互選院長副院長選舉事務進行程序草案。（四）監察員職務分配表。</p>
<h3>互選辦法逐條討論　爭辯熱烈原案通過</h3>
<p>今日會議中討論最久，爭辯熟烈，亦為最重要之案件者，為巨選辦法（草案原文已見七日本報）。首由主席提出是否逐條討論，抑首作大體討論？當有人認為應逐條討論。首起發言者為張定華，渠聲明曾參加七日下午之起草委員會，但對於經起草委員會通過之草案不能全部同意，即其中第一條所列全體監委均為互選院長副院長之當然候選人之說明係「以經政府公布之當選名單為準。」張氏認為應改為以已報到之委員為限。旋有胡文陣發言稱。監委當選膺選後，即已獲得監委資格，不應以其未報到即剝奪其資裕，故即使未報到，仍應保留其候選人之資格，主張照原草案條文通過。其次復有李正樂·陳訪先等發言。王冠吾同時提出另一異議，即主張以條文內旣已增列改選辦法，在案由內即應增列「改選」字樣，以符實際。當由田炯錦以起草委員會主席資格起立說明稱：憲法上規定為互選，並無改選，故不得遽行列入。其次，關於互選阮長副院長候選人之規定，以報到委員出席者為限之修改問題，在起草委會中表決時，係以三十五對四，僅得四票之絕對少數遭否決，至此當由主席宣告對第一條條文之付表決，計在塲人數一二二人，贊成維持原案者六十七人，多數通過。第二條第三條均無異議通過。第四條有　覺發言，主張在原條文　院長副院長之選舉，均以得出席人數過半數之票數者為當選」句中，「均」字下應加一「應」字。黃為女性，為兩日來第一個發言之女委員。渠之提議當獲通過。第五條亦略作文字之修正。第六條第七條均無異議通過。第八條為改選辦法，有人提出修正　見，認為在四分之一以上人數之提議後，出席委員過半數即可，惟經田烱錦解釋後，即仍照原草案通過。原文九條通過後，續計論以次各案：均經無異議通過，末討論郝遇林之臨時動犧，並經倪弼修正者：「公開競選，秘密投票，競選人得作十分　之競選演說」，討論甚久，惟表決後，以十七票絕對少數否決。大會即於十二時一刻散會。</p>

<p>專論</p>
<h3>對於立法院之期望</h3>
<p>— 胡先驌</p>
<p>今年五月二十日行憲政府之正副總統就職，十七日立法院正副院長選出，孫科先生以得五百五十八票當選為正院長，陳立夫先生以得三百四十三票當選為副院長，廿四日立法院正式通過翁文灝先生為行政院長，此為憲政實施以後最重要之三件大事。蔣總統在就任演說中鄭重聲明行憲政府必當恪守　法所規定的範圍，執行憲法所賦予的職責；必須整頓軍事，加强軍事，在短期內戡平叛亂；必須整肅吏治，樹立紀網，起用賢能，刷新人事，厲行老核，嚴明賞罰，勸求民隱，减除地方民衆所受法外之苛擾，更必須簡化法令，　訂權責，統一執行之機構，芟除繁複不切實際之法規；在經濟措施方面，必須貫澈三民主義的實施；治標則必須以有效的方法穩定幣値，平衛收支，管理金融，改善交通，使物價趨於安定，人民得無窮困，治本則必須推行士地改革，保護佃農利益，推廣農地貸款以平均地權；必須用異進稅率，徽收過分利得，取締投機暴利，以節制資本；尤必須推行合作事業，獎進農工生產，保護合法貿易，歡迎國際投資。蔣總統所摽舉新政府之施政方針，實為全國人民所企望者。然在新憲法所規定之條文下，立法院有絕大之權，不但一切重要法規皆須由立法院立法，且立法之後，行政院必須見諸實施，否則行政院長必須辭職。故在今日立法院之權，乃遠在訓政時期之上。勝來國家政治之休明與否，立法院所負之音，反較行政院為大。故人民所期望於立法院者，尤超乎所期望於行政院者之上也。</p>
<p>當前最重要最迫切之事為戡亂。然而經濟戡亂之重要更在軍事戡亂與政治戡亂之上。我國在八年抗戰之後，又經過兩年剿匪，民生凋敝日極。老弱死於　壑，少壯不服兵役，便為共匪參軍，或聚嘯山林成為股匪。田野荒蕪，災民遍野，而以戡亂需款，於是　購徵實，誅求無藝，適以為　敲雀，徒增亂源。而豪門奸商，投機囤積，富者益富，　者益貧。過去徵稅，皆不及於富豪，政府始終不敢徵收財產捐，取締投機囤積亦無有效方法，故立法院第一要務，即在通過嚴密徵收財產稅與徽用國人在國外存款之法規，以平民憤而裕財源，庶以平衡收支，穩定幣値，此期望於立法院者一也。</p>
<p>土地改革為當前之急務。耕者有其田，尤為民生主義所標榜。同時匪黨正以土地改革方案為其政治資本。即在地方政府如廣西山西河北福建亦有其單行之土地法規。處此情形，立法院之訂定土地法，尤刻不容緩。或者澈底使耕者有其田、或訂立限田法，或採用地政學會所提方案，使佃農在十四年後取得所佃之田之所有權，或發行土地公債，購買地主之土地以分配於佃農，或廣行土地貸欵，使佃農可有資金購買地主之土地，或限定地主所有之田不能超過某一限度。超額之田，無價收歸國有，轉而分與貧農。此皆須徽集專家之意見，寨愼討論，訂定法規。法規訂定之後，即須普遍實施，同時取消地方政府所訂之單行法，以謀法令之統一。尤有要者，即共匪與各地方政府所定限田之額，皆嫌過低，此農學家經濟學家人人所能言者。今日立法委員中農業專家甚多，甚盼彼等能擬訂通過適合國情適合農業經濟之士地法也。</p>
<p>復次。為人民謀福利尙有與耕者有其田同樣重要者，即蔣總統所標舉之推行合作事業獎進農工生產是也。農業有季節性，故在農產品宋收割以前則穀價騰踊。貧農存儲不足，每須高價購責食糧。及至新殺登塲則榖價　落。又每每在脅黃不接之際，農民被迫而接受高利貸，甚或忍痛豫賣靑苗。此種剝削必須澈底取締，則信用貸款與抵押貸款實為市要。今日農民銀行雖亦此方發展，惜貸款之規模過小，不足以應農民廣大之需要。經濟學家每謂合作制度為實現社會主義最優良之方式。盼立法院在此方面從速訂立完善之法規，並擴大農貸，使農民得以免除高利貸之剝削，與收　時　賤之損失。則增進農民之利益，即所以解除革命之危機也。</p>
<p>復次農民占全國人口百分之八十以上，而在工業不發遠之情况之下，國家之歲入，大部利賴農民所　之租稅。近年烟葉之價格　漲，政府所徵收之烟草稅在上海一埠竟占消費稅百分之六十以上。即此一端可概其餘。然而政府為謀農民之福利，曾費幾何經費？過去行政院不設農林部。今日農林部之經費占全國歲出預算之最小額。中央農業試驗所夙有成績，而經費極少，不能慶開其事業為農民興利徐害。姑舉一例：據估計江南某省每縣每年耕牛死於生疫者約一萬頭。以今日之物價計之，全國死亡耕牛之損失，必為極大之天文數字。而今日美國已有終身免疫之血淸，法國又發明ROX之聖藥，茍能使全國農業改進所有充足之經費，擴大其機構，即制止默疫一項·每年减少國家與農民之損失者將不可億計。至於興修水利，改良種子，增加肥料，農產加工，種種農業科學上之措施，可以增加國富而裕民生者，其數殆不在工業化之下，而所費之經費必較小，今憲法上規定敎育文化科學經費，須占全國歲出預算百分之十五。則為最大多數之民衆謀羅利計，農林事業經費應占全國歲出之若干乎？故立法院必須在各方面增加農林事業經費以謀增進農民之福利。此期望於立法院者二也。</p>
<p>今日之在官者，固多賢能，然　冗無能貪污執法之惡吏，亦不在少數。而　貴與高級將領之貪污其數量之巨尤駭人聽聞。賞罰不明，紀綱不立，久為巾外所騰笑。而冗員益多，行政效舉　低下。政府日日言裁員，而戡亂建國委員會以厚　　養坐食之冗當竟至數千人之多。又自新縣制施行以來，縣級官吏驟加數倍，而縣政之不舉猶如往普。如何確立人事制度簡化機構　汰冗員以節經費，如何簡化行政手續，及芟除繁複不切實際之法規，以增加行政效率，皆有賴於賢　之立法。此期望於立法院者三也。</p>
<p>敎育為立國之大本，而我國之敎育制度不能配合人民之實際需要；義務敎育尤以缺乏經費不能普遍認眞辦理，至無以掃除文實，提高一般人民之知繼水準；高等敎育亦以經費不足，有名無實。因之全國敎育之水準日見低落，無以配合建國之需要。雖憲法規定敎育文化科學經費占全國歲出預算百分之十五，然尙未見諸實施。又科學為近代立國之基礎，科學不能迎頭趕上，即無以自存於今日之世界。蘇聯有鑒於此，故不惜以龐大經費以擴充科學研究事業。故能在短期間，使其科學發達　駸可以追蹤英美，一躍而為兩大强國之一。我國在戰前十年科學研究尙有規模。至今日則以經費缺乏，科學研究十九陷於停頓狀態。前年國防最高委員會曾通過一決議案規定以歲出總預算百分之一列為舉辦科學研究專款。然而主計處竟不將此項經費列入預算，荏苒兩年，終未見諸實施。遂使國內科學研究不能進展。今後如何澈底改革敎育制度，如何將憲法所規定國家總預算中百分之十五敎育經費照數又付，以及如何實施國防最高會議籌撥總預算百分之一之科學研究專款，皆有賴於立法。此期望於立法院者四也。</p>

<h3>蘇佔區司令召開顧問會　商討德國問題對策　德人民一致抗議六國協定</h3>
<p>〔路透社柏林七日電〕接近蘇軍政府之人士透露，德境英美法司令今晨以倫敦會議公報之副本，送交之蘇軍總司令索柯洛夫斯基後，索帥立即召集其高級顧問，討論終止德境四强合作之問題。開會竟日，當決定倫敦會議之決議，業已廢止前此有關德國之各項協定，以後西强定穗合作即將終止。據云，蘇方答覆倫敦公報之嚴正聲明，在廿四小時內即可發表。</p>
<p>〔聯合社倫敦七日電〕美英法比荷盧六國對西德協定，蘇聯反對自屬意料中事。目前一大問題，即為蘇聯將在東德有何舉動。蘇聯在六國會議問幕前即已竭力反對六國單獨解決西德地位，並稱將拒絕承認任何決議。共黨半官方初次反響，可於蘇軍核准之「柏林晚快報」見之。該報宣稱，「西方各國深知未先徽求德國人民意見而遽籌組聯邦政府，莫斯科方而決不贊同。」</p>
<p>〔路透社柏林八日電〕據調查結果，德國各黨派甚至在西德佔領區內之德國團體，莫不一致反對六國關於西德之計劃。反對之主要理由乃為六國於事先並未微求德國之意見。商德人十咸恐蘇聯為報復起見，將造成德國之永久分裂。德社會民主黨稱，六國協定為鞏固德國政治及經濟不滿意的方法。</p>
<p>〔路透社柏林七日電〕蘇聯所主特之德國人民大會主幹委員會，今日發表宣言，對倫敦六國會議之建議提出嚴重抗議，斥為分裂德國之第一步。宣告指出六國公報內竟無隻字提及和約問題。並曰，西德政府成立之後，將受西方强國否決權之限制，魯爾區亦將被自德國經濟制度中奪去，置入無限制的外國管制之下，以利用其生產能力供西方集團之用。</p>
<h3>法閣批準西德協定　國會週五討論將起激辯</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕倫敦八日廣播：巴黎訊，法國內閣本日對有關德國西部之六國協定，已予核准。該項協定將於星期五掛交國民議會，預料將發生激辯。</p>
<p>〔路透社巴黎七日電〕法國黨派對倫敦六國會議所決定之設立西德制憲議會及國際管制魯爾計劃，咸採反對態度·許曼政府之地位，已因此感受威脅。平常支援政府之議員亦認六國會議建議之對西德政策，令人深感震驚。國民議會已定本星期五辯論此事，而國民議會外委會將於星期三光行討論，屆時皮杜爾外長如不能减輕議會之恐懼而消滅其批評，則由於政府在國民議會中未有絕對多數支援之故，必將陷入岌岌可危之地位。各黨派中除共黨及戴高樂派均已表示反對外，中間派領袖若電諾及人民共和黨之若干要員亦均尙有懷疑。反對者之主要理由，乃為六國會議建議的管制魯爾生產計劃，不足以適當地保障法國之利益。法國深恐法國及荷比盧將為英美德代表意見所左右，甚至可使德國在英美與歐陸國家中取得舉足輕重之地位。預料皮杜爾之辯述，將聲明六國會犧建議乃整個西方外交政策之一部，馬歇爾方案以及西歐聯盟同亦均為該一外交政策之一部，若接受該政策之一部而拒絕其餘部份，事實上勢所不能云。</p>
<h3>捷在德邊陲　築防禦工事</h3>
<p>〔聯合社德國別旭斯魯八日電〕捷德邊界捷克各方面正在建築防空所及其他防禦工事，德國方面可以望見。建造工人與兩師軍隊之數相等，邊界一帶所有重要橋　均已被破壞。</p>
<h3>西德協定中　否決權取消　此點最有意義</h3>
<p>〔聯合社柏林八日電〕軍政府方而認為西方各國對德新協定巾，以取消否決權為最有意義。國際共管魯爾為戰後德國最不易解決之問題，現在協定巾聲明其國際據構將由多數表決，並由多數授權該機構，查察德政府在魯爾區是否不履行義務。據某方面稱，魯爾區國際機構至少應為一工作團體。蘇聯於整個對德問題，常運用否決權，阻碍四國決議，一如其在聯合國安理會，遂令盟國管制委會之功用，成為一蘇聯宣傳機關。</p>
<h3>國際社會黨大會　通過決議案</h3>
<p>希望四强覓取合作　色致德國陷於分裂</p>
<p>〔路透社維也納七日電〕在此舉行之國際社會黨會犧，七日通過決議案，其中表示希望德國之四佔領國得以覓得共同的解決辦法，以防德國亦即歐洲之分裂。大會並決定設立委會以審查魯爾問題，投票贊成該決議案者共十四國，僅虜森堡一國棄權。決議案有云。（上略）大會雖尙不知六國會議有關魯爾協定之全部內容，然於聞悉已獲協議之訊，認為不失為一趨向統一陣綫之切實步驟。大會要求魯爾區每一國際管制委員會之組織及職權，必須得以保證歐洲之安全及其復興原則之腹行。本人之深信如果德國人民決定贊成德社民黨所提使魯爾主要工業成為公有之建議，則對於歐洲之和平及福利必有重大臂助。在任何環境之下，決不能允許此等工業重成任何一國資本家之私產。本會於研究魯爾問題之後，益信有使歐洲經濟權力之主要地位交由國際管制之需要，因此本會已設立一個委員會，繼續審查此一問題向下屆大會提出報告。</p>

<p>〔聯合社成功湖七日電〕蘇聯代表葛羅米柯今晨在聯合國安理會初次公開表示欲派遣軍事觀察員至巴勒斯坦，據稱美法比三理事國聞已被邀供給觀察員，蘇聯政府亦擬派員參加。此舉遂使若干國自巴勒斯坦問題發生以來一向煩擾之內幕情形初次成為公開，即聯合國機構能否强制巴勒斯坦停戰而不引進共產軍。各代表聆言後，甚為驚異，立即暫停討論，致鴛本國政府請示，至少在十日下午以前不致討論該案。</p>
<p>同時安理會接到聖地戰事調解員貝那多特報告稱，關於促使猶太與阿刺伯雙方停戰四星期一事成敗如何，希望能在九日報告安理會。葛氏並稱安理會並未說明選派軍事觀察員之方法，徒因美法比三國參加調解委員會而有派遺觀察員之權利，此種理論蘇聯政府碍難接受。</p>
<p>〔路透社倫敦八日電〕阿拉伯國家對安理會聖地休戰四星期建議之答覆，將於九日在開羅向聯合國調解員那多特提出。據埃總理諾克拉茜透露，阿刺伯領袖正在考慮猶人所已接受關於休戰期間移民問題及給養耶路撒冷區猶太人問題之折衷建議，此兩點固為休戰談判之　結所在。猶方對於第一點已同意由貝那多特在休戰期間監督已及兵役年齡之猶太移民以防其成為戰鬥部隊，關於第一點猶太方面已接受紅十字會之建議，由紅十字會在休戰期內負責耶城十萬猶人之給養。</p>

<h3>公共交通公司　困難之佐證　各綫每日乘客卅萬　無票者佔百分四十</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕據本市公共交通公司最近統計，所屬各綫車輛，每日無票乘客佔總運量三分之一强，每月損失應得營業收入達六七百億元之鉅。該公司成立之初，曾決心根絕軍警無票乘車之風，惟實行時困難重重，且每因此引起糾紛。嗣後公司當局鑑於實際情形，不得不改變初衷，曲從「慣例」，惟常此以往，公司業務之發展，必大受阻礙，且勢將加速客票增漲之週期性，增加市民負担。該公司研究委員會特為此事增設運量觀測組，聘任觀測員十餘名，實地駐各綫重要停軍站統計上下乘客。此項工作已繼續三個多月，並從賣票員·查票員等外勸人員處收集材料，編製乘客總數與持票乘客人數比較表，根據者為該公司所屬行駛於全市之一至七路，九至十五路，及廿路等十五綫，二百五十餘輛客車三個月來在一天中之平均數字：（一）路綫上買票之乘客人數為二十萬零五百廿七人。（二）持有月季票之乘客人數一萬一千二百九十六人。（三）實際觀測之乘客人數三十萬零六百二十六人。以實際觀測人數减去路綫上買票與特有月季票者，，其差數（為無票之乘客數）佔總數百分之四十一點九。（其中包括海，陸，空，聯動，憲兵，警察及該公司員工或同業員工與少量之失漏）。軍人身份者佔百分之卅三以上。並聞英商電車公司，法商水電公司所屬之各綫交通車情形亦皆彷彿相似，各該公司亦正從事統計中。政府當局對軍人無票乘軍問題，亦甚重視，將設法改善云。</p>

<p>另據中央航空公司負責人稱：關於用汕之結匯問題，八日曾電訽交部，據交部航政司負責人覆示，飛機用油已由翁院長正式表示，可按中央銀行牌價結匯。又因航空公司並無出口業務，故無需憑結匯證明書。</p>

<p>麵粉　早市一度緊悄，提高十萬元，但　花一現，旋即回落。老車粉初以二百四十五萬高價開出，旋中信局恢復拋粉之訊傳出，出戶頓多。老軍粉直退至二百三十五萬收市，兵船退為二百三十三萬元，各為軋平，紅蜂建成反跌二萬元。中信局拋粉價二二五萬送到，每戶五十包。麩皮有客帮去化，升十萬。小麥貨方與廠方意不接近，仍不開出。</p>
<p>雜糧　一致轉降，貨主以上日價過高，不免臨高思危。况米價及各物俱已轉平，是以人心轉疲，出戶乘高價售出。黃豆降十萬餘，漢口乍豆收市二百〇八萬。苞米北帮無納胃，挫落二十五萬。新靑白蠶，到貨轉多，跌十五萬．紅糧隨跌二十萬，新元麥亦削十萬元。芝蔴生仁獨告堅定，前者有津帮去化，後者則到存兩領。</p>
<p>食油　漲跌參差，生油因靑島產地日漲，且其他生油到貨寥寥，吉桶生油扳高至二千一百五十萬，計挺六十萬。豆油則在豆價報疲下，廠方開出不少，散戶吐出亦多，降落四五十萬，收市轉昂，大有豆油收市一千七百五十萬元生蔴油跟生汕升五十萬，小車蔴油天津去化升五十萬，豆餅先跌五萬，旋逢低銷多轉升，軋低一二萬元。</p>
<h3>各地商情</h3>

<p>濟南　〔本報濟南七日電〕濟市物價經官方平抑後，六日七日已回跌。頭等麵官方定價為二四五萬一袋，市價為二五〇萬，距難甚近，惟煤汕紙烟棉紗等，因來源缺乏，加以空運增價，反見回漲。</p>

<h3>本客帮吐納一　棉紗布先疲後堅</h3>
<p>昨日棉紗市况，晨開以隔日狂騰，買戶徘徊，四十二支藍鳳細紗喊價比上收下挫一千萬元，嗣因銀根步鬆，本客交易依然活躍，市盤反跌為升，直上至三億九千五百萬元結束，再漲一千萬元。其餘四十支卅二支二十支十六支十文等粗細紗，亦均續挺四五百萬至千萬元左右。</p>

<h3>呢羢又升</h3>
<p>呢羢標準行情，最近來又告上升，非惟秋冬貨外漲內增，即行將落令之凡立頂派力司夏季貨，亦莫不向榮。前日中紡各貨開價提高二成半後，人心復再樂觀，一般貨主相率扳堅。昨意華花呢喊批九百五十萬元，大綸凡而頂七百萬元，蔴告布白凡布法西襯，因紗價躍漲較速，故比呢羢為高。</p>

<p>一，希望我們的代表把中國劇人在抗戰期問及復員後艱苦奮鬥與光榮犧牲的史蹟，能多搜材料，表擾於全世界戲劇友人之前，更希望把日本法西斯强盜對中國戲劇界的迫害加以控訴！</p>
<p>二，希望我們的代表把中國話劇演出水準的提高與進步有所報吿，我們戲劇藝術在近十年來的突飛猛晋，迎頭趕上了英，美，法，蘇等國家是明白的事實，應該使國際戲劇友人知道我們艱苦奮鬥的成果！</p>
<p>三，希望我們的代表把中國戲劇界因受戰禍影響而迫使戲劇運動降入低潮的苦况有所伸述，因為國際戲劇會議的任務之一是「援助受戰禍國家的戲劇事業」，我們不一定需要物質的帮助，但我們願多得一些國際戲劇界親切的「精神援手！」</p>
<p>四，更希望國際戲劇協會的代表會議有切實而又高貴的成就，找出眞正以藝術力量保障國際間和平的方案，希望我們的代表能借他山之石帶回挽救目前中國劇運危機的新法寳</p>
<p>五，最後，希望把紀錄抗戰期問中國劇人堅苦工作的電影——史東山先生編導的「八千里路雲和月」，能運到捷京，在國際戲劇會議期間放映，使國際劇友更具體的知道我們劇友們艱苦的生活實况！（六月七日於滬）</p>
<h3>蜈蚣</h3>
<p>— 李滋</p>
<p>「堂堂校長如此失信，眞是斯文掃地！」范老先生的沙喉嚨又闖進辦公室來了，身子一類一歪地，手還不忘剪在背後，額上靑筋直露，眼睛睜得滾圓。也來不及看看人家寫什麼，（他每次進辦公室總得在每個人的辦公桌邊留連一下，看人家在寫什麼，連家信也不例外。（唾沫四射地大呌：「四天以前就該發薪，到今天人都沒見過，非據理力爭不可，否則真做俎上魚肉了。」</p>
<p>辦公室裏仍然各守「崗位」，結絨綫的結絨錢，批簿子的批簿于　連小陸都沒停了他的哼哼調，三三兩兩的學生遠遠塊在窗口外面交顯接耳，只礙着訓導主任的「鐵面」不敢過來。</p>
<p>說范先生老，一點不假，今年就屆一古稀」之年，在前淸還是一個「附生」，（人家却管呌他秀才」）在本中學敎書已有三十年另九個月。但他自己並不認老，六十歲就生了幾根長眉毛，據他說就靠這幾根「壽眉」便活到儿十歲，吃飯每餐四碗，眼睛牙齒都來得，上課沙嗓子饗徹全校，每週任課二十四小時，初中三班國文，三班歷史，連兩點鐘的外國史也不放棄，好在年紀大，上課必備戒方，來一個「盎格魯撤克遜即楚人後裔考」誰能否認？　他走？嘿嘿！范老先生在這裏敎書的年數就抵得上兩個學生的年齡。</p>
<p>校長不發薪的理由更多：牙痛不來校，不發；公子肚子痛看醫生忙了，不發；下雨出門喚不到軍子不到校，不發；昨天參加什麼聯歡會辛苦了休息一天，不發；禮拜六銀行只辦半天公來不及領錢，不發；星期天當然不發；星期一又要上董事長處公幹，不發；……反正敎師大半是「皇親國戚」——敎務主任是舅佬，訓育主任是姪子，事務主任是外甥，會計是乾兒子……沒人敢說話，到是那位范老先生常唱反調『於是每次發動只得先寒滿他的嘴，以免「多事」，這次不知怎的忘了。范老先生對女學生穿短襪子都要大駡「世風日下」，何况刻扣薪水旣背聖賢之道，又對范老先生不敬，豈不要震怒？</p>
<p>縱使范老先生暴跳如雷，沒人理他也無可奈何，到底是小陸打哈哈：「那末范老先生，你德高望車，很可以和他頂一下呀」</p>
<p>「我嗎？」范老先生到是出乎意外：「嘿，要是我年輕三十年，火氣再大點，看不搞他一下，」說着背着手又走了。</p>
<p>辦公室裏拿一陣哄笑來送他出門。</p>
<p>其實以前范老光生的火氣並沒有現在大，尤其是當事務主任的五年半中，除了對校工有時要頓足大駡以外，對學生，同事，尤其校長，整天笑嘻嘻地向不動怒，罵他　他都受得了。自從那位外甥事務主任追隨校長走馬上任以來，脾氣就大了：粉筆劃傷了黑板，事務主任混蛋；飯裏有砂子，事務處管什麼？敎員配給米要加車錢，豈有此理！課桌扯破了衣服，要事務處賠；文課格顏色印淡了，一定是事務主任串通偷工减料……從沒有完。而且每次總是潑口大駡，從事務主任的父親是引車賣漿者流駡起，一眞到斯文掃地貽禍後裔為止。</p>
<p>剛剛一塲風波平靜，隔不了半天，偏偏在午飯的時候女先生的一桌上吃出一條大蜈蚣來，惹得她們銳聲大呌。這更給范老先生出一個好題目，馬上在膳堂（則辦公室）裏頓脚拍桌大駡，敎員　也起了　；除了直接和事務主任有血親關係的兩位先生外，全拿事務主任做文章，把薪水沒發的怨氣全推在他身上。要他馬上請校長來開會。事務主任原來是由校長牽綫的只知打領幣擦皮鞋的膿包，只得夾着尾巴趕校長公館去，敎員們紛紛在詛咒廁所和廚房合一扇門的不行，歸根結底還是蜈蚣不識相。范老先生得意之至，趕着東一個「唾沫四射」，西一個「四射唾沫」。</p>
<p>「范老先生，」小陸又開了腔，「這次你可不能放鬆啊！大家把那個姓王的事務主任搞掉，就要你來幹滬個。」</p>
<p>「那裏那裏，」范老先生眼睛都笑了，「那個時候我當事務主任，眞是一介不取，那裏像這種不見世面的小夥子，一動就貪污不法，嘿，眞所調後生可畏也矣！</p>
<p>「當然，」小陸說：那時候我們餐餐魚啊肉的，要不是你老秀才廉潔方正，能嗎？」</p>
<p>「我們熟讀聖賢書的人·」范老先生唾沫射得更遠地：「能和這種引車賣漿之流相提並論嗎？」</p>
<p>「哈哈哈……」小陸笑了。</p>
<p>「哈哈哈……」范老先生也笑了。</p>
<p>校長自然不能不來，一到，膳廳裏馬上毫無聲息。顧不得下午還有課，立刻召開膳食會議。開會之前，又請范老先生到校長室談幾句體已話。膳廳三條方桌一拼，便成了會議室。</p>
<p>當然是校長主席，更當然校長第一個說話：</p>
<p>「……事務主任王先生年輕不懂事，辦伙食又沒有經驗，我想以後還是另外由同事們大家自已組織膳食委員會，自已來經管，不知道各位贊成不贊成？」</p>
<p>默不作聲，通過。</p>
<p>「不過，我有一點拙見，」范老先生提議了。「食，性也，大家都想吃得好，但又要吃得便宜；熊掌我所欲也，魚我所欲也，兩者不可得兼。要便宜，只得一簞食一瓢飲，回也不改其樂；要吃得好，我輩束修菲薄，不勝負擔；不過　，天之將降重任於期人也，必先勞其筋骨，　其體膚，我的意見如此，不知各位如何？」</p>
<p>「最好噬，」校長說：「又要好又要便宜　但是不能負擔也是事實。我想菜壞點也不要緊，一則為大家省錢總沒有錯，只要清潔實惠就是了。各們意見怎樣？」</p>
<p>默不作聲，無意見，通過。，「那末，我想我們就組鐵購食委員會吧！范先生年高德劭，辦伏食又有經驗，就請他當膳食會主席吧。」</p>
<p>「那，那，那怎麼可以呢？」范老先生滿臉是芙地推辭着。</p>
<p>「不用客氣，」校長說：「我想，范先生素來為大家欽佩，公意推舉你也不好固辭吧！「</p>
<p>「那末，我只好受之有愧了，」范老先生向大家拱了拱手。</p>
<p>「我想，」校長說：「膳食委員再加兩位就够了，一位事務主任王先生，關於各種事情接頭方便些；再一位哩——我想就陸先生好了，諸位意見怎樣？」</p>
<p>默不作聲，完全同意，通過</p>
<p>「好吧，」主席說：「從明天起伙食就由膳食委員會接辦，道個月的薪水本來今天要發，上午我因為有一位在南京當處長的來，陪了一早；吃過飯剛要上銀行去領款，王先生就來喚我了，來不及去，就明天發吧。發了薪水，伙食就容易辦了，米要立刻就買，油柴都可以國一些比較便宜，如果范先生不接頭就請王先生接洽好了。」</p>
<p>開學時候買的二十石米，只吃了五石左右，校長說過是為敎員先買的，還有幾箱油，幾十袒柴火當然都不在「移交」之列，物價跳上三倍了，但也沒人敢問一聲。</p>
<p>「還有什麼提議？」校長拉出大金掛錶看着，等了約摸半分鐘，就宣布：「沒有提議，散會。」</p>
<p>全會歷時十又八分半鐵。結束。</p>
<p>「這是一塊臘肉骨頭晚上范老先生和小陸商量今後騰食方策時悄悄地說：「你們年靑人不知道，等到担子壓上來的時候，就不得不幹。</p>
<p>小陸會意地笑笑，沒出聲，哈哈不打，哼哼調也沒唱</p>
<p>范老先生畢竟老了，自從當上騰食會主席，火氣眞的减退不少，連文課簿少了頁數都沒發事務主任的脾氣，反說學生氣量太窄。「斯文」沒聽見講起，上課時喉嚨「沙」的成份都輕些，原因是講話不使勁，倒讓學生談笑飛「紙彈」的聲音蓋過了它。可是在辦伙食上却一份也沒老相，服務熱心得比外甥事務主任還勝過三分。</p>
<p>（三七·六·四·滬·）</p>
<h3>散文二題</h3>
<p>— 賈晨</p>
<p>水沫頌</p>
<p>我揹着生之重負：抬頭遙望着艱辛的路途，祗見層層的濃霧，還有陣陣的腥臭；恐怖與　怯的心情幾乎使我失去摸索前進的勇氣飛和決心。</p>
<p>我揹着生之重負：我走近水邊，倚傍着一株老松，凝視着變幻莫測的浮雲；浮雲象　着此事，也象徵着人生。驀然低頭，平靜的水面正盪漾着銀珠樣的水沫，柢抗着波浪的衝擊，此起彼沒，一顆顆細小的水沫，密密連結在一起，波浪的衝擊越兇，水沫也愈聚越多；繼續的抵抗，繼續的掙扎，在它的掙扎與抵抗之中正顯示着河水的流動。轉瞬間銀珠樣的水沫已變成一片雪白的浪花。——於是我記起古人說的：「逝者如斯夫！不捨晝夜。」水流恰似時光的飛逝，水沫浪花就是生命的光輝了；所以也唯有不斷的行動，才能證實生命的眞實。</p>
<p>我揹着生之重負：嘴角掛着微笑，離開了孤松，面對着艱辛的路徑前進。我抱着最大的決心，就是道樣，一步復一步，行行重行行，學習着水沫的精神！</p>
<p>我揹着生之重負：聽到瀑布在山腰間發怒了，它有如急躁的老人，為了看不慣山林中的骯　，以雄壯的聲音在呼喊着同伴來冲洗山間的污穢。我又看到銀珠似的水沫，嚮往於山石樹根被冲洗後的淸潔光亮，高興得和它的同伴們飛舞起來。在山間做着掃除工作。</p>
<p>我揹着生之重負：走上山頂，迎接朝陽。我要看朝陽的旭光照到山腰也照到山脚，照到溪邊也照到河邊，我要看水沫映着旭日飛舞，銀樣的珍珠化成萬點金星，照亮了黑暗的大地，洗淸了人閒的污穢。</p>
<p>我揹着生之重負，興奮地走向光明的大地，走向人間。我如朝山香客一樣虔誠的去探索眞的美的生活，一步復一步，行行重行行，是子夜了；萬籟俱靜，大地已經入夢。我浴着月光，拖着痰乏的脚步，還在繼續前進。祗要這世上還有一灣流水；幾點水沫，我總會堅忍而愉快的。我要找到水濱，掬一捧淸泉來洗去臉上心上的風麖；我要在堤邊小坐，讓微風吹拂去我的疲勞；我要躺下來細聽水沫娓娓動人的聲音；我要它再為我說一遍它的朋友出污泥而不染的故事。污泥顯示着毀滅，也預兆着新生！</p>
<p>轉眼間，東方微白，我躍起身子帶着這美好的故事，與輕捷的脚步。在報曉聲中，奔向黎明</p>
<h3>影子</h3>
<p>每夜，風雨無阻的，我總得繞着僻靜的街頭漫步一圈，養成這種習慣已快一年了，步行在黑黝黝的街沿上，我好像已脫離了現實而奔馳在心之領域中，我拿這種閑散呌做享受；也是一種體味。</p>
<p>街上是萬籟俱寂，夜凉如水，偶而一輪街車馳過呌出一陣尖銳的聲音；但這無損於夜的美，隨着一切說更沉靜了，靜得祇聽見自己的脚步踏着平坦的馬路擦擦的聲音。</p>
<p>貓眼似的街燈正照出一圈昏黃的光暈，伴着我的是在身邊搖幌着，亦步亦趨的黑影。它雖然從來不開口；但我知道它是我的知友，它的了解我與我的了解它是一樣。我微側過頭來偷瞧它一眼，它是那麼的尊嚴，用沉默的熊度在指摘我的錯誤，抨擊我的懦弱。在它的質問下，我無法回答什麼；除了默認之外，只更覺一陣心的沉重。我不能再聽下去，我想逃避它。於是飛快的加速脚步，在轉灣口，站停身子正想喘一口氣的時候，它又跟在我的身邊了。</p>
<p>我低頭繼續行走，心頭在猛烈的跳動。晚風迎面吹來，感到一陣淸凉；我又聽到一聲溫和的語氣說，「把思想與行動配合起來；不甘心作奴隸的不會減亡！」我懷着羞慚與感激，激動得不自主的掉下了眼淚。</p>
<p>在迷朦的情緒中，我已站在自家的門口；預備推門進去的當兒，我畏怯的伸出于來想和它道別。可是，不知在什麼時候它已不見了，祇　着門燈瞪大眼睛奇怪的在望着我。</p>
<h3>墨荷</h3>
<p>— 錢君匋</p>
<h3>最近的世界文壇</h3>
<p>— 趙景深</p>
<p>最近瑞典首都的劇人，數　比戰時還要多。他們不曾失望，斯德　爾學的皇家劇院演出了很多極有興味的獻劇。這是國家所扶助的補關，歐洲最妤的當中的一個，政府每年津貼九萬元。但該劇院須靠售　收人，每年另付出三十五萬元。就靠着這點費用，他們演出了現代美國，法國，英國一直到莎士比亞的劇本，價格比美國百老匯便宜得多。</p>
<p>皇家劇院從托爾斯細（Stig　Torslow）導演的「與父親同住的生活」（Life　With　Father）開始戲劇的季節。一　就是五六個月，雖然批評家認為這劇本是不直得在國家劇院演出的。以丹麥被佔領為題材的劇本，愛貝爾（Kjell　Abell）所寫的「絲堡」。（Castle　of　Silk）却得到批評家極端的贊美，這原因也許是由於同情斯干底那維亞姊妹的國家甚過劇本的本事。這劇本即作於丹麥被佔領後不久，出版得也快？回憶到一九〇〇年的丹麥，混合着寫實與象徵的手法。</p>
<p>第二個上演的劇本是白格受（Hjalmar　Bergman）的「馬庫里爾斯化華德可坪」（Markurells　I　Wadkoping,　1979），這是純粹瑞典的　，以一個小城為背景；中心人物馬　甲爾斯是一個穴居　鬼一樣的醜人，外表粗暴而自誇，但却極為敏感，鐘愛他那唯一的兒子。被全絨所欺騙嘲笑，連他的妻子也不是例外，他不知道這孩子其實不是他的兒子。這孩子將在高等學校畢業以前，馬庫里爾斯纔發現這是對的，於是他的心碎了。但當這孩子痛快地考過以後，第一個就來吿訴他，喊着：一父親，父親：……」抱着父親，馬庫里爾斯便忘記了一切人們的嘲笑，被這熱情所激動，知道現在這孩子無疑的是他的兒子了。瑞典有名的浪漫的演　華爾（Anders　de　Wahl）現已七十八歲演這男主角。這劇本頃一九二二年初演時一樣的受歡迎，因為這是眞正瑞典本國的精神和背景。</p>
<p>在斯德哥爾摩爾近德羅特寗河爾摩（Drottningholm）劇院演過莫里哀的一夫人學堂」以後，皇家劇院又演出了「禮查第三」（Richaml　III）。瑞典現存最偉火的劇人漢生（Lars　Hanson）演那　視軌　步的驕傲的禮查，演得極有力量。但劇本太長，須足足演四小時，觀衆和演員是同樣的吃力。此劇由蘇怕格（AlfSjoberg）導演。漢生二十五年通就在京城演過這戲，現已六十二歲，但仍舊與初演時一樣的年青。</p>
<p>拉辛的Brittanlcus由莫南道（OlofMolander）導演，加上挪威山德爾（CoraSandel）「克南的客棧」（Krane'sTavern），便完成了這個戲劇的季節。</p>
<p>此外在各劇院演出的戲有蕭伯納的「人與超人一，達加曼（Stig　Dagarman）的新劇本「定死罪的人」（Den　Dodsdomde）等。達加曼在二十四歲時就寫過三本長篇和不少短篇，但劇本却還定初次寫。大意寫男主角被定　為謀殺他的妻子，其實是她的愛人謀殺了她。他幾瀕於死，終於釋放。因感到判斷不公，憤而殺一女人，即作為惟的婁子，再度投案。</p>
<p>社會服務</p>
<h3>讀者意見　服務社會乎壟斷牟利乎</h3>
<p>一搜者盼靑滬長途汽車公司知所醒悟</p>
<p>編輯先生：上海市公用事業，自五月份起，加價實分之廿，一般與論，莫不猛烈抨擊，且聞市參議會有調查各公用事業帳目，及審核加價合理與否，以謀阻止再加價的準備。雖然五月份的價是加定了，但是與論的制裁，和市參議會的舉動，至少給了人民一些安慰，而使各公用事業日後的加價，也顧忌了不少。</p>
<p>試看我們靑浦的靑滬長途汽車公司，他們享有靑滬路專利之權，獨家經營，生意鼎盛。自五月份起，加價百分之八十，好在道路沒有第二家公司，不會來養爭生意，他們儘可有恃無恐。他們忘了公用事業是有關社會福利。人民生計的獨占事業，這個獨占性，是應以服務社會為宗旨的。其性質決非「托　斯」所可比擬，其價格更絕對不許　斷牟利。奈靑浦彈丸小地，輿論可說沒有，縣參議會雖有而若無。素仰貴報服務社會，不遺餘力，敬懇主持正義’惠賜披露，俾靑滬長途汽車公司知所醒悟，得能由　斷牟利，轉變而為服務社會，則小民幸甚矣！青浦讀者施元仁　上。</p>

<p>自由談</p>
<h3>簡化機構</h3>
<p>— 孫鶴</p>
<p>簡化機構，原則上是值得讚揚的一件事。駢枝機關太多，疊牀架屋，不但徒軞國帑，而且也使老百姓有「父母官」太多之感，「子民」不好「奉養」「菽水」還是小問題，而且也常常弄得無所適從。公事常常像足球一樣，這一脚踢過來，那一脚又踢過去，三天可了之事，也許三月還兜着圈子辦不完。</p>
<p>但是相伴着此舉俱來的還有兩點值得注意：</p>
<p>機關裁汰了，人員到那裏去？吃飯是一問題，這一大批人似不能聽其投閒置散，由他失業。</p>
<p>簡化機構是走向促進政治效率之一道，但並不便是等於促進政治效率，還得看辦事是否緊張，官僚作風是否减縮到最小的限度。减少了水量固然可以使藥質加濃，然而如不換藥，依然去不了病。</p>
<h3>太多的史料</h3>
<p>— 梅白</p>
<p>一個歷史家所遭遇到的最大的困難，往往是史料不足，以致下筆時無所依據。在第二次大戰後，情形可恰恰相反，據說是史料實在太多，簡直令人無從下手了。</p>
<p>美國政府的檔案處最近發表了一點數字：美國自有史以來到珍珠港事件發生以前為止，政府保存的檔案共佔地位約七十萬立方公呎；但是從珍珠港事件發生後，單舉由各部隊及政府各部鬥送請保存的檔案，却已須佔地位一千八百萬立方呎之多，將來東京戰犯審畢後，恐怕還有大批檔案要來。這些浩如烟海的文件中，有些是的確極有價值的，但也有不少却毫無意義可言，若要把它們仔細鑒別，實在不是一件容易的事情。</p>
<p>事實上美國齣史家在戰事的初期便已經看到了這一點，所以他們就向羅斯福總統建議，在若干部隊及政府機關中各派負責戰史的專員，一切檔案及其他史料，都先經他們妥為刪節，加以整理。這個建議當被採納，立即實行，可是各機關的人事糾紛鬧得相當兇，當事人儘量掩飾自己的錯誤，而在指摘對方的時候却往往無中生有，並不根據事實。例如糾紛鬧得最大的一個機關是戰時生產局，幾個主持人簡直是一開頭就鬧意見，一直鬧到日本投降，從未間斷，至今在寫個人回憶錄的時候，還在攻擊對方。而戰時生產局的「歷史專員」想從各方面採訪一點事實眞相的時候，却是到處碰釘子，他所得到的一句回答常是：「這些事與公衆無關，無需有所記載。」</p>
<p>軍隊裏的情形也一樣，不過問題的癥結倒比較簡單，就是：凡不利於部隊長官者，概不公布。即使某將領犯了極顯著的錯誤，以致一般人民都已發覺出他應負某一次挫折的責任，但部隊裏面却還是嚴守「隱惡揚善」的信條，決不把眞正有關的材料　露出來。</p>
<p>除掉這些檔案之外，名人的回憶錄自然也極為重要。邱吉爾，赫爾，貝爾納斯，史汀生都有回憶錄問世，有許多已故的要人，如霍布金斯，史迪威將軍等，則有人代他們輯錄傳記，也已一一完成。他們身歷其境，自然說的話該有分量，司是即以貝爾納斯的一說老實話」而論，競選下屆總統最有希望的紐約州州長杜威就說過，貝爾納斯是美國有史以來最不懂國際關係的國務卿！而邱吉爾與史迪威二人偏見之東，更為人所共知的事實。</p>
<p>還有美國各總統往來的函併，數量也着實證人。如以前的塔虎脫總統，即有往來函稿約一百萬件保留在美國的國會圖書館。此外尚有總統自已的日記一萬五千頁，都是密密排列的小字。但塔虎脫較之羅斯福總統（指F.D.R，不是老細斯福），却又如小巫之見大巫。羅斯福的函件現在保存在海德公園住宅和國會圖書館的，所佔的書箱或書架的長度都要以幾英里計，使雄心勃勃的歷史家見之祗能望洋興歏。</p>
<h3>尺牘再談</h3>
<p>— 鄭逸梅</p>
<p>時賢尺牘，用自製牋者，亦不乏其人，如陳夔龍用壽字牋，中一壽字，旁有丙子五月庸叟製牋時年八十等字，狹長，蓋作便條用也。朱鳳蔚為能吟虎嘯館牋，顧鼎梅為金佳石好棋牋，社進高為三定簃牋，陳巨來為安特牋，吳湖帆為綠遍池塘草詞牋，葉譽虎為遐庵牋，周瘦鵑為紫羅蘭貪牋，趙眠雲為心漢閣牋，張碧梧為碧梧桐館牋，周梅泉為今覺　牋，高吹萬為格簃牋，陳蒙安為紉芳簃牋，黃　農為蔗香館牋，吳眉孫為寒匏簃牋，他如陳子和之百葉館牋，唐企林之袖海齊牋，凌虛之茫無頃齋牋，巢章甫之海天樓牋，陳從周之隨月樓牋，俞慧殊之風不寧齊牋，不勝枚舉也。</p>
<p>朋好中頗多畫家，往往用一素牋，自繪一二折枝花卉於其上，然後再行作書，如商笙伯，姚虞琴皆是，而鄧春澍更用扇形之紙，如作札於扇頭然，尤為別致</p>
<p>予為紀念亡友，特將見貽之札，付諸裝池，題之為人琴之慟。初僅漱六山房主人，畢幾庵，李涵秋，余天遂，朱鴛雛，王均卿，許指嚴，蔣箸超，陶報癖，王梅　，孫曬蝯，吳雙熟十餘人，豈知不數年而歸道山者，以數十百計，偶一檢視，不勝傷逝自念之慨</p>
<p>昔人謂不以人廢言，予乃不以人廢札，如汪精衛，王叔魯，褚民誼，以及爰居閣主，亦收得若干通，猶以朱獲黃秋岳為憾，蓋秋岳筆札殊精好也。</p>
<p>予於高僧書，有印光，弘一，太虛；翰苑耄宿　，有俞陛雲，製心劍，沈琪泉，商衍瀛，錢自嚴，吳蔭培，陸鳳石，張燕昌，程宗伊；域外人書，則有日本藝人橋本關雪，用毛筆寫漢文；此偕廢札中之特色也。</p>
<h3>趙古泥死於河豚</h3>
<p>— 錢大成</p>
<p>余前曾以趙古泥逸事，揭諸自由談，昨晤王紀玉姨丈，姨丈與古泥交至深，述古泥致死之因，實綠不戒於口。姨丈聞古泥病，因往訪，見古泥整理平生所刊印譜至忙碌。姨丈謂之曰：「君病，何不自逸？」古泥日：「聊以遺日耳！」繼笑謂姨丈曰：「我鐘愛之食物，今又上市矣。」姨丈知為河豚，亟戒古泥曰：「君病，切忌食此物！」彼漫頷之。越數日，聞古泥病益甚，因又走訪，謂古泥曰：「君必食河隊矣！」彼笑曰：「僅食少許耳，即為家人奪去。豈靈驗至此。」未幾，古泥竟卒。</p>
<p>初，古泥亦嘗病瘧，久不得愈，乃以大碗盛冷飯，佐以冷紅燒肉，汲睢陽泉（虞山名泉，在逍遙遊）並食之；登床高臥，竟渙然大汗，遂吿痊。每以此誇人，稱為愈瘧奇方。友人吿以不可為訓，彼漫不合　乃竟以好奇老　喪其身，惜哉。否則若古泥之康强健碩宜享大年，何止六十。乃彼樂天任命，病亟，嘗　其　日：「我以鄉曲小兒，從士大夫游，獵取浮名，得年六十，天不負我矣！」</p>
<p>友人沈抱一吿我：古泥嘗主其家，彼治印時，好吃零食，尤嗜松子肉。</p>
<p>古泥亦嗜賭，更好作馬弔戲；然不許人旁觀偶有人旁視，則將中發白成對或三枚者打出，旁人驚訝謂為打錯，則彼即起立曰：「發牌乃我自由，亦何嘗有定法？君旣有興，君即人席可耳！」返引去。</p>
<p>古泥好登山臨水，更精鑒別骨鯊，游揚州得元戳，在杭州得漢磚，資斧皆從此出。</p>
<p>古泥亦善畫，楊先恙丈謂其花卉極似李復堂。</p>
<p>古泥垂歿，元恙丈總其生平，為賦生挽詩二十章，有云：「石幾不戒口，冒死喫河豚；蘆牙漸長大，春洲斷人魂。」「石農峻風骨，和光復同塵；雖然鐵門限，怖交新貴人。」丈不輕許人，可以知古泥之為人矣。</p>
<p>古泥卒於民國二十二年四月十四日。著有拜缶廬印存四十卷，泥道人詩二卷。同邑金叔遠先生為撰墓誌銘。</p>
<p>古泥歿已十五年，頗有仿冒其書體以射利者；然羊質虎皮，不能神肖其中一包。</p>

<h3>洋葱治病</h3>
<p>— 雨窗</p>
<p>你如果拿起一隻生洋蔥來，剝掉外面一層皮，放在嘴裏咀嚼五分鐘——你的嘴裏就可以說已經澈底消毒，所有的細菌和微生蟲都絕跡了。有時，祗要嚼一分鐘就可以殺盡口腔內的微生物。這是蘇聯學者托金博士最近研究的結果。</p>
<p>美國許多科學家也曾從事於有關洋蔥的研究。據他們說：洋蔥的氣味雖然不大好聞，但是這氣味本身就能殺掉病萬。他們已開始以洋蔥搗爛，使氣味「薰」在病人創口發炎作膿疼痛的地方，往往有止痛消腫的功效，且能助長新肉。蘇聯的醫生也己嘗試以洋葱的氣味洽創口發炎作膿，他們每次用洋蔥一二枚，搗爛，置淺碟中，使面積與創口的大小相仿，「冀」十分鐘後，即能消腫化膿，「薰」二次後即能長出新肉。</p>
<h3>「萱堂」</h3>
<p>— 尢墨君</p>
<p>夜監自修，有位同學在看尺牘。他問我「萱堂餘蔭」這句作何解。我說以「椿」比父，以「萱」比母，這種用法，由來已久，故「萱堂」即謂母親；用到「餘蔭」，則「椿」已不在可知了。按稱母為「萱」，本於毛詩「焉得萱草，言樹之背」，自無疑義；但終覺大不妥，因萱草別名「妓女」，見本草綱目！</p>
<p>我意尊稱人母，還是說尊堂來得妥。陸士龍答卓茂安書中已有「尊堂憂灼」之語可證；否則用「太夫人」亦行，社子美詩有「起居入座太夫人一之句，很是大方。</p>
<h3>自題朱竹</h3>
<p>— 散木</p>
<p>先生畫研朱，爛醉寫竹箇，下筆驟奔馬，酒氣拂四坐。乍看光煥赫，恍值陸渾火，祝　恣騰擲，紛紛神鬼墮；又疑悲翁悲，滿紙血淚裏，奋哀進肝腸，掩面泣如洒。客謂先生醉，胡為徒自苦，先生答　不，客豈知我者？此世知何世，斫殺遍四野，各懷蠻觸心，其氣不肯下，豈但陸渾災，久矣乾坤簸，嗟彼蒼蒼者，寗恤下民瘴。我欲鉏惡竹，惡竹信繁夥，我欲逃世塵，何處容袒裸，寫此當　　，願客無笑我。語罷客　參，峻聲報日可，舉頭看靑天，無語覆諸夏。</p>
<p>###</p>
<p>讀本月一日首版、新閣濟濟羣英的二十位部會首長的人傑銅版，一一看過，看到最末一位許老英雄，不禁悠然而興思古之情。此君宦海資格極深，飽歷滄桑，今猶健在，察其神色，頗不龍鐘，計其年齡，當早逾古稀矣、</p>
<p>這位老英雄是五十年前的老拔貢（前淸光緒二十三年丁　科），朝考得意，用為七品小京官，分刑部，由此步入司法界。淸末光宣間仕途騰達，由京而外，舊法官做過按察使（即果司，三品，為一省刑名總匯，「玉堂春」三堂會審中「籃袍」之權威，足以寫實，吾於北平京報及津大公報之戲劇專刋中曾詳為考證）；新法官做到高等審判廳丞（即民國初之高等審判廳長，現在高等法院長）。他有個同年拔貢，同官刑部，又是安徽同鄉，姓名是汪守珍，二人交誼甚篤，富貴不相忘，彼此提携，老許做奉天高等廳的時候，汪君亦做黑龍江高等廳。民國初年，許汪又同為司法界高級長官，眞是形影不離，而今許氏老當益壯，汪則久矣夫無聲無臭。</p>
<p>法界向分兩系，一是老刑部，二是留學生。老刑部　習例案，熟於舊律及辦案經騐，如上述許汪及董康王式通皆是。留學生學於東西洋者，乃基於現代文明之新法律。當淸末維新，嫌大淸律及舊刑官之陳腐而改良司法，則留學生及在本國學習新法律之人才，自為時代之驕子。但幾個老刑部的老角色，當前淸過渡時期，亦居要任，兼研新學，長於行政，故民國初年審撿各官雖廣用畢業生，而幾個長官仍須老宿，如老許者，民國元年即任司法總長，因其晚淸在東三省頗有能名，徐世昌介於老袁老段，極見倚畀。但其最初受知於老徐，則又另有警務之特別表見。時當淸光緒之李，淸廷初創警政，以徐及趙秉鈞為管部堂官，調用各部人員，事屬初創，貴族顯官多不　約束，困難問題，層見疊出，許以微員調用，獨出心裁，妥為解決，以此受知，號為能員，不數年，位至三品。民初一度長法司後，其仕途變為多方面的，如福建巡按使（即彼時之省長），交通總長（黎總統段內閣時代），國務總理（老段執政時代），至七七事變前之駐日大使（聞係老段推　，初任命時，段尚在世），則又外交重任，眞可謂「多能」之「儁人」了。堂兄遂初喜談相法，曾云許全身五短（身與四肢皆短），而面部五官之位置謹嚴，氣聚，是日「金形」，皆為貴徽。予於此道不甚了了，以其語頗有趣，附誌於此。</p>

<h3>The Control Yuan Will Elect its President Today, With Yu Youren and the People's Party Having the Highest Hopes for Election. Cao Haosen Decides to Compete for Vice President; Zhao Shouyu Has Given Up.</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Nanjing, 8th] The Control Yuan's selection of its president by mutual election among the members of the first session is scheduled for the morning of the 9th. Yu Youren, the former president of the Control Yuan, who is considered the most likely candidate for president, registered at the registration office at 11:10 AM on the 8th. It is widely believed that the election of the president can be decided in the first round of voting. The assembly hall for the election has been prepared, and the members will vote in four areas. There will be two ballot boxes, and votes will be counted on the spot. The ballots will be made of folded, letter-size Xuan paper, listing the names of all the members elected and announced by the government. Other procedures will follow the same format as the National Assembly's election of the president. The vote supervisors and vote counters were nominated at the second preparatory meeting on the 8th.</p>
<p>As for those competing for the presidency of the Control Yuan, besides Yu Youren, there is Zhu Wen as the second candidate. The number of candidates for vice president is increasing daily. In addition to Liu Zhe, Tian Jiongjin, Chen Zhaoying, Zhang Weihan, Wang Guanwu, Mei Gongren, Xiao Yishan, Lu Chao, and Cui Dianhua (female), it is reported that Cao Haosen has recently announced his decision to join the race. The candidates are all actively engaging in behind-the-scenes activities for nominations. Zhao Shouyu, who originally intended to compete for the vice presidency, publicly announced his withdrawal at the preparatory meeting on the 8th. His main reason was that there were too many candidates, which would scatter the votes. In order to concentrate opinions and save time, he decided to withdraw from the race. At the same time, he also stated that the requirements for the vice president should be youth and vigor, and he claimed that he did not meet the requirements. He then looked around and bowed to express his gratitude.</p>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Nanjing, 8th] The first session of the Supervisory Committee of the Control Yuan held its second preparatory meeting at 9:15 AM on the 8th, with 122 supervisory committee members in attendance. Liu Zhe chaired the meeting, which passed (1) the draft method for the mutual election of the president and vice president of the Control Yuan; (2) the draft method for voting and counting votes for the mutual election of the president and vice president of the Supervisory Committee; (3) the draft procedures for the election of the president and vice president of the Supervisory Committee; and (4) the duty assignment table for supervisors.</p>
<h3>The Mutual Election Method Was Discussed Item by Item; The Original Plan Was Passed Amidst Heated Debate.</h3>
<p>The longest and most heated debate during today's meeting, and also the most important case, was the mutual election method (the original draft can be found in this newspaper on the 7th). First, the chairman asked whether to discuss it item by item or to have a general discussion first. Some people thought that it should be discussed item by item. The first to speak was Zhang Dinghua, who stated that he had participated in the drafting committee on the afternoon of the 7th, but could not fully agree with the draft passed by the drafting committee. He pointed out that the explanation in the first article that all supervisory committee members are natural candidates for mutual election of the president and vice president "is based on the list of elected members announced by the government." Zhang argued that it should be changed to be limited to members who have registered. Then, Hu Wenzhen spoke, saying that supervisory committee members who have been elected should already have the qualifications of supervisory committee members, and their qualifications should not be deprived even if they have not registered. Therefore, even if they have not registered, their eligibility for candidacy should still be retained, and he advocated passing the original draft. Next, Li Zhengle, Chen Fangxian, and others spoke. Wang Guanwu also raised another objection, arguing that since the article had already added a re-election method, the word "re-election" should also be added to the preamble to reflect the actual situation. Tian Jiongjin, in his capacity as chairman of the drafting committee, stood up and explained that the Constitution stipulates mutual election and does not mention re-election, so it should not be hastily included. Secondly, regarding the modification of the regulation on candidates for the mutual election of the president and vice president, limiting it to registered members who are present, it was rejected by an absolute minority of only four votes against thirty-five votes during the vote in the drafting committee. At this point, the chairman announced the vote on the first article, and out of the 122 people present, 67 voted in favor of maintaining the original plan, which was passed by a majority. The second and third articles were passed without objection. In the fourth article, Huang Jue spoke, arguing that in the original article "the election of both the president and vice president should be based on obtaining more than half of the votes of the attendees," the word "both" should be followed by the word "should." Huang was a woman, and was the first female member to speak in the past two days. Her proposal was passed. The fifth article was also slightly modified in wording. The sixth and seventh articles were passed without objection. The eighth article was about the re-election method. Some people proposed a modification, believing that after a proposal by more than a quarter of the members, a majority of the attending members would be sufficient, but after Tian Jiongjin's explanation, the original draft was still passed. After the original nine articles were passed, the subsequent cases were discussed one by one, and all were passed without objection. Finally, Hao Yulin's temporary motion was discussed, and after being amended by Ni Bi: "Open competition, secret ballot, candidates may make a ten-minute campaign speech," but after deliberation, it was rejected by an absolute minority of seventeen votes. The meeting adjourned at 12:10 PM.</p>
<h3>National Representatives Liu Ziya, et al., Advocate for Speedy Currency Reform</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 8th] National representatives Liu Ziya, Peng Xiaofu, Li Hongru, Zhang Fu, Dai Tianqiu, and over a hundred others, based on the review opinions of the second report of the fourth review committee of the proposal review committee of the first session of the National Assembly, which combined eleven proposals regarding currency reform, "request that the government organize a currency reform research committee to plan and implement it as soon as possible." This was passed by the fifteenth meeting "according to the review opinions." The secretariat of the National Assembly recorded the case and transferred it to the government for consideration and handling. However, nearly two months have passed, and there has been no indication of how the government is handling it. Therefore, they have again written to the secretariat of the National Assembly to request that the government earnestly implement the resolution of the National Assembly and reform the currency system as soon as possible.</p>
<h3>Trade Agreement Between Us and the Dutch East Indies: Exchange of Goods</h3>
<p>[United Press, Singapore, 8th] According to the "Free Press," the Chinese Textile Company reports that the Chinese government is negotiating a trade agreement with the Dutch East Indies to supply ten million yards of Chinese cotton cloth to the Dutch East Indies. If the agreement is concluded, it will be the largest batch of cotton cloth exported by China after the war, enough to counter Japanese goods. The Chinese government has agreed to the principles of the agreement, but requires that part of the price be paid in kerosene and diesel, and the rest in US dollars or gold pounds.</p>

After the proposers explained, those who supported and those who opposed engaged in a heated debate, stating their reasons and making their voices heard. No conclusion was reached by noon, so Chairman Sun announced the adjournment of the meeting, and the discussion continued in the afternoon. The meeting continued at 3:20 PM in the afternoon, and the discussion on the Liu case lasted for another two hours. It was resolved to pass the first reading and hand it over to the Finance and Banking Committee for review, and to submit it to the Yuan meeting for discussion before the end of the extended session period at the end of this month. This case was thus temporarily concluded. The second case, the proposal by Qi Zhihou and others to organize a military investigation team, was reserved for discussion after a brief discussion. The remaining cases were left for discussion at the meeting on the 11th, and the meeting adjourned at 6:00 PM.</p>
<h3>Passing Telegrams of慰問 to Soldiers Fighting Bandits</h3>
<p>Telegrams of Condolence to Compatriots in Bandit Areas and Overseas Compatriots</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 8th] The Legislative Yuan's eighth meeting on the 8th passed three telegrams: telegrams of慰問 to the soldiers fighting bandits on the front lines, telegrams of condolence to compatriots in bandit areas, and telegrams of greeting to overseas compatriots. The telegram to慰問 the soldiers stated: The Communist bandits betray the nation, destroy culture, harm the country, and harm the people. Their crimes are obvious. Even their loudly proclaimed New Democracy is nothing more than deceiving intellectuals, enslaving workers and peasants, and practicing mob dictatorship. Their economic plunder is to support their brutal military attempts to seize power and subvert the government. All of us descendants of the Yellow Emperor, unless we are insane, share the same hatred for the Communists. Our government army bears the great mission of preserving Chinese history and culture, and spares no sacrifice in fighting the Communists in bloody battles. Their loyalty to the country and their courage to save the people are truly moving to the people in the rear. The Legislative Yuan members, who come from the people, can represent the true public opinion. During the first session of the assembly, we, on behalf of 450 million compatriots, extend our sincere慰問 to our loyal and brave soldiers. We hope you will be further encouraged and achieve complete success as soon as possible. The country will be fortunate, and the people will be fortunate.</p>

Those who have been harmed by bandits and those who have been struggled against can adopt mass trials. The families of the victims can sentence bandits to death, but elderly women who do not have the skills to kill can designate someone to carry out the execution on their behalf. Specific methods have been agreed upon with the North China剿總, and in the future, this "method" will be used to lead the general戰, to start agricultural bandit suppression work in Hebei, and will be submitted to the central government for trial nationwide.</p>

<h3>Wu Tiecheng and Chen Bulei Issue a Joint Statement</h3>
<p>Hoping that People from the Democratic Youth Party Will Participate in the Two Yuans and the Government</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 8th] Wu Tiecheng, Secretary-General of the Central Executive Committee of the Chinese Nationalist Party, and Chen Bulei, Acting Secretary-General of the Central Political Committee, recently issued the following statement on the issue of cooperation between the three parties:</p>
<p>Since the war of resistance against Japan, the Youth Party and the Democratic Socialist Party have been of one heart and one mind with our party, working together to overcome national difficulties. For more than ten years, they have always stood firm. This kind of unity is the spirit of the country and the foundation of cooperation between the three parties. Now that the Constitution is being implemented and a constitutional government has been established, in order to make the democratic system healthier, establish a foundation for party politics, and achieve rapid success in quelling the rebellion and building the country, our party has the greatest confidence and sincerity in the continued cooperation of the three parties. Regarding the results of the election of candidates nominated by the two friendly parties as legislators, the number of elected members did not reach the expected quota. The responsible comrades of our party's central committee have repeatedly expressed their apologies. President Chiang has talked with the responsible persons of the two parties and expressed his sincerity. Now, the only thing to do is to try to remedy the situation while taking into account the legal facts, but it will take time. The Legislative Yuan has been in session for a month, and the Control Yuan has also convened. We hope that the legislators and supervisors who have been elected by the two parties will attend as soon as possible to exercise their due powers, so as to make clear the consistent spirit of the three parties. After Dean Weng of the Executive Yuan took office, he invited people from the two parties to shoulder the heavy burden with the greatest sincerity. We sincerely hope that the people of the two parties will inherit the spirit of national planning and resolutely participate, so that the Executive Yuan can achieve the effect of cooperation, and all kinds of important policies can be actively carried out. As for other departments, President Chiang also hopes to recruit people from the two friendly parties and social figures to participate, so as to ensure that there are no regional boundaries and that talents are used to the fullest extent, so that politics can become more substantive and complete. We deeply know that the consistent struggles of the Youth Party and the 민社黨 for many years have been aimed at laying the foundation for the country and establishing a constitutional government. As for the Chinese Nationalist Party, which adheres to the teachings of the Prime Minister, its sincerity in hoping that everyone will work together to complete the building of the country is also well known to society. Since the goals of the three parties are the same, they will be able to comfort the nation with the facts of national unity and hard work under the great righteousness of the nation and the people."</p>

<p>[Our Correspondent in Nanjing, 8th] The 민社黨 has been holding internal meetings for days to discuss the solution to the election problem of legislators.

<p>[Our Correspondent in Nanjing, 8th] It is reported that Chen Qitian, the Minister of Industry and Commerce of the Youth Party, who has been appointed by the President, will come to Nanjing from Shanghai next week to take up his new post, and the Ministry of Economic Affairs will be renamed the Ministry of Industry and Commerce from the day he takes office. According to news from the Youth Party, the party expects that the dispute over legislators can be resolved within a week. At that time, the Youth Party will participate in the Executive Yuan as usual and preside over the two ministries of Agriculture and Forestry and Industry and Commerce. However, when deciding to participate in the Executive Yuan, the Central Standing Committee will still hold a meeting to discuss the candidates.

<h3>Expectations for the Legislative Yuan</h3>
<p>— Hu Xiansu</p>
<p>This year, on May 20th, the President and Vice President of the Constitutional Government took office, and on the 17th, the President and Vice President of the Legislative Yuan were elected. Mr. Sun Ke was elected as the President with 558 votes, and Mr. Chen Lifu was elected as the Vice President with 343 votes. On the 24th, the Legislative Yuan formally approved Mr. Weng Wenhao as the Premier of the Executive Yuan. These were the three most important events after the implementation of constitutional government. In his inaugural speech, President Chiang solemnly declared that the constitutional government must strictly abide by the scope prescribed by the law and perform the duties entrusted by the Constitution; must rectify military affairs and strengthen military strength in order to quell the rebellion in the short term; must rectify officialdom, establish discipline, appoint the virtuous and capable, refresh personnel, strictly implement assessments, clarify rewards and punishments, seek the people's grievances, reduce the illegal oppression suffered by local people, and must simplify laws and decrees, clarify responsibilities, unify the implementing agencies, and eliminate complicated and impractical regulations; in terms of economic measures, must implement the Three Principles of the People; to treat the symptoms, effective methods must be used to stabilize the currency value, balance revenue and expenditure, manage finance, improve transportation, so that prices tend to stabilize and the people are free from poverty, and to treat the root causes, land reform must be promoted, the interests of tenant farmers protected, and agricultural land loans expanded to equalize land ownership; a progressive tax rate must be used to levy excessive profits, crack down on speculation and profiteering to control capital; and cooperative enterprises must be promoted, agricultural and industrial production encouraged, legal trade protected, and international investment welcomed. The policy guidelines for the new government put forward by President Chiang are indeed what the people of the country expect. However, under the articles stipulated in the new Constitution, the Legislative Yuan has great power. Not only must all important laws and regulations be legislated by the Legislative Yuan, but after legislation, the Executive Yuan must implement them. Otherwise, the Premier of the Executive Yuan must resign. Therefore, the power of the Legislative Yuan today is far above that of the Tutelage Period. Whether the country's politics are enlightened or not depends on the Legislative Yuan, and the responsibility it bears is even greater than that of the Executive Yuan. Therefore, the people's expectations of the Legislative Yuan are even higher than their expectations of the Executive Yuan.</p>
<p>The most important and urgent task at present is to quell the rebellion. However, the importance of economic pacification is even greater than that of military and political pacification. After eight years of war against Japan and two years of suppressing bandits, the people's livelihood has become extremely depleted. The old and weak die in ditches, and the young and strong, instead of serving in the military, join the communist bandits or gather in the mountains and forests to become bandit gangs. Fields are barren, and disaster victims are everywhere, and in order to fund the suppression of the rebellion, funds are requisitioned, and extortions are endless, which is precisely like driving birds away from the nest, only increasing the source of chaos. Meanwhile, wealthy families and unscrupulous merchants engage in speculation and hoarding, the rich get richer, and the poor get poorer. In the past, taxation did not extend to the wealthy, and the government has never dared to levy property donations. There are also no effective methods to crack down on speculation and hoarding. Therefore, the primary task of the Legislative Yuan is to pass strict laws and regulations on the levy of property tax and the requisition of deposits held by Chinese nationals abroad, in order to appease public anger and increase financial resources, so as to balance revenue and expenditure and stabilize the currency value. This is one expectation of the Legislative Yuan.</p>
<p>Land reform is an urgent task at present. Those who till the land should own it, which is what the Principle of People's Livelihood advocates. At the same time, the bandit party is using land reform as its political capital. Even local governments such as Guangxi, Shanxi, Hebei, and Fujian have their own single-item land laws and regulations. Under these circumstances, the Legislative Yuan's enactment of land laws is all the more urgent. Either thoroughly enabling those who till the land to own it, or enacting a law limiting land ownership, or adopting the plan proposed by the Land Administration Society, allowing tenant farmers to acquire ownership of the land they till after fourteen years, or issuing land bonds to purchase landlords' land and distribute it to tenant farmers, or widely providing land loans so that tenant farmers can have funds to purchase landlords' land, or limiting the land owned by landlords to a certain limit. Excess land should be nationalized without compensation and redistributed to poor farmers. All of this requires gathering the opinions of experts, careful discussion, and the enactment of laws and regulations. After the laws and regulations are enacted, they must be universally implemented, and at the same time, the single-item laws enacted by local governments must be abolished to seek unification of laws and decrees. What is even more important is that the amount of land limited by the communist bandits and local governments is too low, which is something that all agricultural economists can say. There are many agricultural experts among today's legislators. It is hoped that they can formulate and pass land laws that are suitable for the country's conditions and agricultural economy.</p>
<p>Furthermore, there is something that is equally important to the people's welfare as those who till the land owning it, which is the promotion of cooperative enterprises and the encouragement of agricultural and industrial production that President Chiang has put forward. Agriculture is seasonal, so before agricultural products are harvested, grain prices soar. Poor farmers do not have enough savings and often have to buy food at high prices. And when the harvest is low, farmers are forced to accept high-interest loans or even painfully pre-sell their crops. This kind of exploitation must be thoroughly eliminated, and credit loans and mortgage loans are essential. Although the Farmers Bank is also developing in this area today, the scale of the loans is too small to meet the broad needs of farmers. Economists often say that the cooperative system is the best way to realize socialism. It is hoped that the Legislative Yuan will promptly enact sound laws and regulations in this regard, and expand agricultural loans so that farmers can be freed from the exploitation of high-interest loans and the losses of selling at low prices during the harvest season. Then, increasing the interests of farmers is the way to resolve the revolutionary crisis.</p>
<p>Furthermore, farmers account for more than 80% of the country's population, and under the circumstances of undeveloped industry, the state's revenue largely relies on the taxes paid by farmers. In recent years, the price of tobacco leaves has soared, and the tobacco tax levied by the government accounts for more than 60% of the consumption tax in Shanghai alone. This one example can illustrate the rest. However, how much funding has the government spent to promote the welfare of farmers? In the past, the Executive Yuan did not have a Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry. Today, the funding for the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry accounts for the smallest amount of the national budget. The Central Agricultural Experiment Station has a long history of achievements, but its funding is very limited and it cannot expand its operations to benefit farmers and eliminate harms. To give just one example: it is estimated that about 10,000 heads of cattle die from epidemics in each county of a certain province south of the Yangtze River each year. At today's prices, the loss of cattle deaths nationwide must be an extremely large astronomical figure. Today, the United States has a serum that provides lifelong immunity, and France has invented the ROX drug. If the agricultural improvements of the whole country could be given sufficient funding, and the agency expanded, even preventing cattle epidemics alone would reduce the losses to the country and farmers by an incalculable amount each year. As for water conservancy projects, seed improvement, increased fertilizer, and agricultural product processing, all kinds of agricultural scientific measures can increase national wealth and benefit the people, and the number is almost no less than industrialization, and the cost of the funding must be smaller. The Constitution stipulates that the funding for education, culture, and science must account for 15% of the national budget. Then, for the sake of the welfare of the largest number of people, what percentage of the national budget should the funding for agriculture and forestry account for? Therefore, the Legislative Yuan must increase the funding for agriculture and forestry in all aspects in order to promote the welfare of farmers. This is another expectation of the Legislative Yuan.</p>
<p>Today, there are many virtuous and capable officials in office, but there are also not a few corrupt and incompetent evil officials who abuse the law. The amount of corruption of dignitaries and high-ranking generals is particularly shocking. Rewards and punishments are unclear, and discipline is not established, which has long been ridiculed by people inside and outside the country. The number of redundant personnel is increasing, and the efficiency of government is declining. The government talks about downsizing every day, but the Committee for Suppression of Bandits and National Reconstruction has as many as several thousand redundant personnel who are well-paid and idle. Since the implementation of the new county system, the number of county-level officials has suddenly increased several times, but the county administration is still as lacking as before. How to establish a personnel system, simplify agencies, eliminate redundant personnel to save expenses, how to simplify administrative procedures, and eliminate complicated and impractical laws and regulations to increase administrative efficiency all depend on the legislation of the virtuous. This is the third expectation of the Legislative Yuan.</p>
<p>Education is the foundation of a nation, but China's education system cannot meet the actual needs of the people; compulsory education is particularly lacking in funding and cannot be universally and seriously implemented, so it is impossible to eliminate illiteracy and improve the knowledge level of the general population; higher education is also nominal due to insufficient funding. As a result, the level of education in the country is declining day by day, and it cannot meet the needs of national construction. Although the Constitution stipulates that the funding for education, culture, and science accounts for 15% of the national budget, it has not yet been implemented. Science is the foundation of modern nation-building, and if science cannot catch up, it will not be able to survive in today's world. The Soviet Union, in view of this, has not hesitated to expand scientific research with huge funding. Therefore, in a short period of time, its scientific development has been able to catch up with Britain and the United States and leap into one of the two major powers. China had a scale of scientific research in the ten years before the war. Today, scientific research has fallen into a state of stagnation due to lack of funding. The National Defense Supreme Committee passed a resolution last year stipulating that 1% of the total budget should be allocated as a special fund for scientific research. However, the Directorate General of Budgeting, Accounting and Statistics did not include this expenditure in the budget, and two years have passed without it being implemented. As a result, domestic scientific research cannot progress. How to thoroughly reform the education system in the future, how to fully pay the 15% of the national budget for education stipulated in the Constitution, and how to implement the special fund for scientific research that the National Defense Supreme Council planned to allocate 1% of the total budget to, all depend on legislation. This is the fourth expectation of the Legislative Yuan.</p>

<p>[Our newspaper's Zhenjiang dispatch on the 7th] The Donggua Dali and other mountains in the Shangdang district of Zhenjiang contain coal mines.

The Jiangsu Construction Department repeatedly ordered the Jianhua Company, which had previously obtained the mining rights, to resume mining, but no reply was received. Now it has announced the revocation of its mining rights. Recently, it sent technicians Wu Changyou and others to Donggua Mountain, Dali Mountain, Xiaoli Mountain, Pogang Shi, Mashan, the northeast of Baishan, the north of Nishan and Yanshan, and the Zhang Guolao Temple area bordering Xunrong for exploration.

<h3>Kunming Traditional Chinese Medicine Practitioner Li Shuxia Flies to Chongqing for Treatment, Creating a Good Story. Zhu Shaoliang's Leg Ailment Still Awaits a Miraculous Cure.</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Chongqing Dispatch, 8th] Guan Quanbin, the Chief of Staff of the Chongqing Garrison Command, invited our newspaper reporter today to talk about the miracle of Li Shuxia, a traditional Chinese medicine practitioner residing in Kunming. It began with the 79-year-old mother of Peng Bin, the captain of the Second Brigade of the Chongqing Internal Police, who had been ill for a month. From the 5th, she fell into a coma and lost control of her bowels and bladder. Guan telegraphed Li on the 2nd, urgently asking him to fly to Chongqing, without mentioning a word about the symptoms. Li immediately replied to the police, saying that if Peng's mother was under sixty, he could guarantee her safety. Because of old age, the Yang energy must be depleted, and prolonged illness weakens the Qi. The most important thing to avoid is phlegm, because ginseng moistens and helps phlegm. It is the number one "Chinese traitor" among Chinese medicines, so it must be avoided. If a fever has already developed, it is because the isolated Yang is escaping outwards. It is most important to avoid using ice. And Western medicine, nineteen out of ten times, is of the metal and stone Yin nature. Even if the body does not have a fever, it is easy to turn the entire body into a pure Yin state. Therefore, it hinders appetite and even causes abdominal pain and hardness, which is even more so because of the accumulation of Yin evil. Milk and soy milk should be prohibited to avoid what is called gastric stagnation and bladder结. Also, Qi stagnation will make it difficult to defecate, and urination will definitely turn yellow. Enemas must not be performed. The letter included a prescription, but Peng did not dare to use it. After Li arrived in Chongqing from Kunming on the 6th, Peng's mother's pulse was only beating nine times per second. He quickly took out a small package of medicine he had prepared and instructed to purchase top-grade cinnamon and cook it together. On the 7th, he cooked five catties of white Aconitum tuber. This morning, Peng's mother was already able to sit up in bed, smoke a water pipe, and even asked for food. Li is 59 years old. He studied Western medicine in Japan in his early years. Because his three sons were all killed by misdiagnosis from Western medicine, he became interested in traditional Chinese medicine and then studied it in depth. When Li Genyuan formed the cabinet, he served as the Secretary-General. He now has the Gu Fu Traditional Chinese Medicine Hospital on Ping'an Street in Kunming. This time, at Guan's invitation to come to Chongqing, thirteen wealthy individuals were willing to charter a plane to come along, but he refused. Currently, there are many long-distance phone calls from Kunming to Chongqing every day. Guan has decided to introduce him to diagnose Director Zhu Shaoliang's leg ailment that has not healed for many years.</p>

<h3>Soviet-Occupied Zone Commander Convenes Advisory Council to Discuss Countermeasures to the German Problem. German People Unanimously Protest the Six-Nation Agreement.</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Berlin, 7th] Sources close to the Soviet military government revealed that after the British, American, and French commanders in Germany sent a copy of the London Conference Communiqué to the Soviet Commander-in-Chief Sokolovsky this morning, Sokolovsky immediately convened his senior advisors to discuss the issue of ending the Four-Power cooperation in Germany. After a day-long meeting, it was decided that the London Conference resolutions had abolished all previous agreements related to Germany, and that future cooperation with the Western powers would come to an end. It is said that the Soviet side's solemn statement in response to the London Communiqué will be released within 24 hours.</p>
<p>[United Press, London, 7th] The Soviet opposition to the agreement on West Germany by the United States, Britain, France, Belgium, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg was to be expected. The big question now is what actions the Soviet Union will take in East Germany. Even before the Six-Nation Conference, the Soviet Union had vigorously opposed the Six Nations unilaterally resolving the status of West Germany and stated that it would refuse to recognize any resolutions. The first semi-official Communist reaction can be seen in the "Berlin Evening Express," which is approved by the Soviet military. The newspaper declared, "The Western powers know full well that Moscow will not approve of forming a federal government without first seeking the opinion of the German people."</p>
<p>[Reuters, Berlin, 8th] According to investigations, all German parties, even German groups in the West German occupation zones, unanimously oppose the Six-Nation plan for West Germany. The main reason for the opposition is that the Six Nations did not seek German opinion beforehand. Germans are generally afraid that the Soviet Union, in retaliation, will create a permanent division of Germany. The German Social Democratic Party said that the Six-Nation agreement is a method of consolidating political and economic dissatisfaction in Germany.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Berlin, 7th] The Standing Committee of the German People's Congress, sponsored by the Soviet Union, issued a declaration today strongly protesting the suggestions of the London Six-Nation Conference, denouncing it as the first step in dividing Germany. The declaration pointed out that the Six-Nation Communiqué did not mention a single word about a peace treaty. It also stated that after the West German government is established, it will be restricted by the veto power of the Western powers, and the Ruhr region will also be taken from the German economic system and placed under unlimited foreign control in order to use its production capacity for the Western bloc.</p>
<h3>French Cabinet Approves West German Agreement, Heated Debate Expected in Parliament on Friday</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper News] London, 8th Broadcast: Paris dispatch, the French cabinet has approved the Six-Nation agreement concerning West Germany today. The agreement will be submitted to the National Assembly on Friday, and heated debate is expected to occur.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Paris, 7th] French parties have adopted an opposing attitude towards the establishment of a West German constituent assembly and the international control of the Ruhr plan decided at the London Six-Nation Conference. Schumann's government is feeling threatened as a result. Deputies who usually support the government also believe that the West German policy suggested by the Six-Nation Conference is deeply shocking. The National Assembly is scheduled to debate this matter this Friday, and the National Assembly Foreign Affairs Committee will hold a discussion this Wednesday. If Foreign Minister Bidault cannot alleviate the Assembly's fears and eliminate its criticism at that time, the government will inevitably fall into a precarious position due to the lack of an absolute majority in the National Assembly to support it. Among the parties, apart from the Communist Party and the Gaullist Party, which have already expressed opposition, centrist leader René Pleven and some key members of the People's Republican Movement are also still suspicious. The main reason for the opposition is that the Ruhr production control plan suggested by the Six-Nation Conference is insufficient to adequately protect France's interests. France fears that France, the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg will be swayed by the opinions of the British, American, and German representatives, and may even allow Germany to gain a pivotal position among the British, Americans, and continental European countries. It is expected that Bidault's argument will state that the Six-Nation Conference's suggestion is part of an overall Western foreign policy, and that the Marshall Plan and the Western European Union are also part of that foreign policy. It is impossible to accept one part of the policy and reject the rest.</p>
<h3>Czech Republic Builds Defenses on the German Border</h3>
<p>[United Press, Bischofsrühl, Germany, 8th] The Czech side of the Czech-German border is building air-raid shelters and other defensive works that can be seen from the German side. The number of construction workers is equal to that of two divisions of troops, and all important bridges along the border have been destroyed.</p>
<h3>The Most Meaningful Aspect of the West German Agreement is the Elimination of the Veto Power</h3>
<p>[United Press, Berlin, 8th] The military government believes that the most meaningful aspect of the new agreement on Germany by the Western powers is the elimination of the veto power. International co-management of the Ruhr has been the most difficult problem to solve in postwar Germany. The agreement now states that the international structure will be decided by a majority vote, and that the institution will be authorized by a majority to investigate whether the German government is not fulfilling its obligations in the Ruhr region. According to one source, the international institution in the Ruhr region should at least be a working group. The Soviet Union has often used its veto power on the entire German question, obstructing the four-nation resolution, just as it does in the United Nations Security Council, thus rendering the function of the Allied Control Council into a Soviet propaganda machine.</p>
<h3>International Socialist Congress Passes Resolution</h3>
<p>Hoping the Four Powers Seek Cooperation to Prevent Germany from Falling into Division</p>
<p>[Reuters, Vienna, 7th] The International Socialist Congress, held here, passed a resolution on the 7th, expressing hope that the four occupying powers of Germany can find a common solution to prevent the division of Germany, that is, of Europe. The Congress also decided to establish a committee to examine the Ruhr issue. Fourteen countries voted in favor of the resolution, with only Luxembourg abstaining. The resolution stated: (Above omitted) Although the Congress does not yet know the full content of the Six-Nation Conference agreement on the Ruhr, upon hearing the news that an agreement has been reached, it believes that it is indeed a practical step towards a unified front. The Congress demands that the organization and powers of each international control commission in the Ruhr area must be able to guarantee the implementation of the principles of European security and its restoration. The principal of this believes that if the German people decide to approve the proposal made by the German Social Democratic Party to make the main industries in the Ruhr public, it will be of great assistance to European peace and welfare. Under no circumstances can these industries be allowed to become the private property of capitalists in any one country. After studying the Ruhr issue, this conference is even more convinced that there is a need to hand over the main position of European economic power to international control. Therefore, this conference has established a committee to continue to examine this issue and submit a report to the next conference.</p>

<h3>The World Hovers at a Crossroads, Future Masters Should Know What to Choose, Gu Weijun Delivers a Speech</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, New York, 7th] Gu Weijun, our ambassador to the United States, said in a speech at the Miami University graduation ceremony today that the world today is hovering at a crossroads. The future of the world and the path of civilization itself all depend on the choice of today's youth between democratic systems and communist authoritarian systems. When discussing the current international situation, Gu also emphasized that "China is the most important battlefield for dealing with communism. International communist leaders have indeed recognized that Asia will eventually be a most important region." Gu also said: The attention of democratic forces is currently focused on Europe, with little regard for the situation in the Far East, but "the leaders of world communism, while deliberately pretending on the surface to focus their attention on Europe, have in fact already placed their biggest bet in Asia."</p>
<h3>Jewish-Arab Conflict in French Morocco</h3>

<h3>Soviet Union Plans to Send Personnel to Supervise the Truce in the Holy Land, the United Nations Feels Surprised, It Will Be Known Today Whether Jews and Arabs are Willing to Ceasefire</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper News] London, 8th Broadcast: Cairo dispatch, United Nations Palestine mediator Bernadotte, regarding the Soviet Union's willingness to participate in supervising the truce in the Holy Land, said: It is still uncertain whether the ceasefire can be achieved at present. If the ceasefire is achieved, many observers will be needed. I believe that everything should be based on needs, and the selection of personnel should be based on a physical and neutral attitude.</p>
<p>[United Press, Lake Success, 7th] Soviet representative Gromyko today publicly expressed for the first time in the United Nations Security Council his desire to send military observers to Palestine. It is said that the three council members of the United States, France, and Belgium have been invited to provide observers, and the Soviet government also intends to send personnel to participate. This move has made public for the first time the internal situation that has been bothering several countries since the Palestine problem arose, that is, whether the United Nations organization can force a truce in Palestine without introducing communist troops. After listening to the speech, the representatives were very surprised and immediately suspended the discussion to ask their governments for instructions. The case will not be discussed until at least the afternoon of the 10th.</p>
<p>At the same time, the Security Council received a report from Bernadotte, the mediator of the Holy Land conflict, saying that he hoped to report to the Security Council on the 9th whether the attempt to broker a four-week truce between the Jewish and Arab sides would succeed. Gromyko also said that the Security Council had not specified the method for selecting military observers, and that the Soviet government found it difficult to accept the theory that the United States, France, and Belgium had the right to send observers simply because they participated in the mediation committee.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 8th] The Arab countries' response to the Security Council's suggestion for a four-week truce in the Holy Land will be submitted to United Nations mediator Bernadotte in Cairo on the 9th. According to Egyptian Prime Minister Nuqrashi, the Arab leaders are considering the compromise proposal that the Jews have already accepted regarding the issue of immigration during the truce and the issue of providing supplies to the Jews in the Jerusalem area. These two points are the crux of the ceasefire negotiations. Regarding the first point, the Jewish side has agreed that Bernadotte will supervise Jewish immigrants of conscription age during the truce to prevent them from becoming combat units. Regarding the first point, the Jewish side has accepted the suggestion of the Red Cross, which will be responsible for providing supplies to the 100,000 Jews in Jerusalem during the truce.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Tel Aviv, 8th] The Israeli government's response to the truce conditions submitted by United Nations mediator Bernadotte has not yet been decided.</p>

<h3>The International Situation Approaches a Delicate Stage: The American People Should Remain Calm; Marshall Feels That Striving for Peace is Not Easy</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Cape Fear, North Carolina, 7th] Secretary of State Marshall, speaking at the University of North Carolina, stated that the international situation has reached "a delicate stage of whether negotiations can be reopened, or whether it will fall into a complete deadlock," to the extent that it cannot be openly discussed. Marshall stressed the difficulty of achieving peace, saying, "Commanding a war is actually simpler than handling international issues and striving for peace today." The American people should have the determination to make long-term plans and not be limited to temporary gains and losses.</p>
<p>[United Press, Cape Fear, 7th] Secretary of State Marshall attended the graduation ceremony of North Carolina State University on the 7th and delivered a speech, emphasizing that in the current complex international situation, capable diplomats are increasingly rare. Marshall expressed his admiration for Lappham (head of the aid to China mission), Hoffman (executor of the Marshall Plan), Graham (president of the university, former chairman of the UN Indonesia Truce Commission), and others. Marshall stated that the complex disputes and volatile situations around the world are increasing the responsibilities of the United Nations, and American diplomatic representatives, in particular, must possess outstanding abilities and extensive experience. Therefore, it is becoming increasingly difficult for us to find individuals who can adequately represent American interests. The easily excitable nature of the general American public also makes it difficult for the government to implement far-reaching foreign policies. Marshall continued, stating that there are two main reasons why long-term foreign policies are difficult to implement. First, the American people are prone to emotional excitement, which is quite dangerous in matters of foreign relations. On the other hand, we must also admit that unless such emotional interest is first generated, general interest is not easily aroused, and necessary political action cannot be obtained. We are a "young country," and the people are energetic and known for their love of individual freedom. In diplomatic affairs, we should adopt a cautious and thorough approach, focusing on the long-term future rather than short-term results.</p>

<h3>Mayor Opens His Purse to Lead, Yet No One Responds; Difficulty in Collecting Special Donations; Committee Discusses Countermeasures; Commissioners Will Personally Solicit When Necessary</h3>
<p>The matter of collecting special donations for relief in the Shanghai area was previously decided to be based on the principle of voluntary donations. Mayor Wu took the lead by generously donating 500 million yuan as an example. However, to date, not a single wealthy family or philanthropist has followed suit, which has truly embarrassed the authorities and saddened the poor. In view of this, the Special Relief Donation Collection Committee held a meeting at 4:00 PM on the 8th to discuss new fundraising strategies, hoping to complete its mission as soon as possible. It is learned that the consensus reached at the meeting was that, when necessary, the commissioners will personally solicit donations from celebrities, business owners, and trade associations throughout the Shanghai area.</p>
<p>[Another Report] Mayor Wu, concurrently head of the Special Relief Donation Fundraising Committee, convened senior city government officials and heads of various bureaus and departments in the city hall conference room yesterday afternoon to discuss methods for each bureau to be responsible for soliciting donations from various trade associations and fellow-villagers associations. It was agreed that each bureau would dispatch three supervisors, carrying official letters from the fundraising committee, to be responsible for promoting fundraising among the fundraising targets independently identified by each bureau and relevant units.

<h3>Foreign Exchange for Oil Used by Shipping Industry Pending Decision by Political Council</h3>
<p>Regarding the issue of foreign exchange for oil used by the shipping industry, the Shipping Association previously sent representatives repeatedly to consult with President Yu of the National Bank regarding the method of foreign exchange. In order to balance revenue and expenditure costs, the industry firmly demanded that oil must be exchanged at the National Bank's official rate; otherwise, even with recent adjustments to freight rates, they still feel that revenue is insufficient and difficult to maintain.

<h3>Lessees of Enemy and Puppet Properties Request Rent Reduction Due to Unaffordable Burden</h3>
<p>The standard for housing rent in this city was previously proposed by the Municipal Council and approved by the Municipal Government Conference, stipulating that the maximum rent for commercial properties is 9,000 times the pre-war rent, and the maximum rent for residential properties is 7,000 times the pre-war rent. However, the Central Trust Bureau recently collected "usage fees" for January and March of this year from lessees of enemy properties and shopfronts, calculated as 17 times higher than the end of December of the previous year, far exceeding the legally stipulated rent standard. The lessees believe that the burden is unaffordable and previously petitioned the bureau's Dongxing branch for a reduction. Subsequently, the bureau's Real Estate Department replied that the above standard for adjusting usage fees was approved by the Enemy and Puppet Property Liquidation Office of the Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui region and implemented after being resolved by the Enemy and Puppet Property Review Committee. The request for a reduction was not approved. Lessees Yang Yongnian, Gan Houyun, and 43 other households submitted another petition to the Municipal Council yesterday, requesting that it inform the Enemy and Puppet Property Liquidation Office of the Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui region to respect the council's proposal and reduce rent to alleviate the difficulties of merchants.</p>
<h3>Military Organs and Troops Must Not Forcibly Rent Civilian Houses; Use Existing Barracks and Public Buildings as Much as Possible</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] The methods for military organs and troops to rent civilian houses and the methods for National Army troops to billet during transit have been revised by the Executive Yuan. The Municipal Government received instructions yesterday and ordered the Police and Civil Affairs Bureaus to comply. The main points of the two methods are as follows:</p>
<p>Main points of the methods for military organs and troops to rent civilian houses: (1) Housing for various military organs and troops should primarily utilize existing barracks and public buildings or self-construction. Requisitioning is prohibited. If there are no barracks or public buildings available for allocation and construction funds are unavailable, civilian houses may be rented. (2) Renting civilian houses should first obtain the consent of the homeowner. Forced occupation is prohibited. If finding civilian houses to rent is difficult, the local government may be consulted to help find them. House rent should be handled according to the standard price set by the local government. If there is no regulation, the local government may be asked to estimate the price. Arbitrary pricing is prohibited. (3) The lease contract should be signed by both parties and certified by the local government.</p>
<p>Main points of the methods for National Army troops to billet: Major cities should have reception centers set up by local military supply agencies, utilizing existing barracks or public buildings as much as possible to allocate accommodation for troops in transit. If there are no barracks or public buildings available or if they are insufficient, camping or setting up tents for accommodation should be carried out to the extent that weather and equipment permit. If there are no public buildings or tents available, the reception center should consult with the local government or township office to find civilian houses. All troops are strictly prohibited from occupying them on their own.</p>

It is hoped that it can be resolved soon.</p>

<h3>Tenants of Changji Lane Pay Rent in Rice; Tenants Request Land Bureau to Stop It</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] Sun Jinfal, Zhou Renjie, and over 40 other tenant households in Changji Lane, Fuxing East Road, Nanshi, jointly submitted a letter to the Land Administration Bureau a few days ago, stating that the head landlord, Junye Company, has repeatedly increased rent, tripling it since January of this year. The second landlord has also increased rent to the third tenants, and starting next month, rent will be calculated in rice, so the burden on the third tenants is very heavy. Therefore, they appealed to the Land Administration Bureau to thoroughly investigate and stop it. Director Zhu of the Land Administration Bureau has ordered a response. According to a responsible person, "The profits of the second landlord should be in accordance with the provisions of Article 6, Paragraph 2 of the Housing Rental Regulations. Therefore, it is necessary to thoroughly investigate whether the second landlord is violating the Rental Regulations and investigate whether the rent collected by the head landlord exceeds 7,000 times the pre-war rent."</p>

<h3>Evidence of the Difficulties of Public Transportation Companies; 300,000 Daily Passengers on Each Line; 40 Percent Without Tickets</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] According to recent statistics from the city's Public Transportation Company, passengers without tickets on each line account for more than one-third of the total traffic volume, resulting in a huge monthly loss of 60 to 70 billion yuan in expected operating revenue. When the company was first established, it was determined to eradicate the practice of military and police riding without tickets, but the implementation was fraught with difficulties and often led to disputes. Later, the company authorities, in view of the actual situation, had to change their original intention and comply with "custom." However, if this continues, the company's business development will be greatly hindered and will accelerate the cyclical increase in ticket prices, increasing the burden on citizens. The company's research committee has specially established a traffic volume observation group for this purpose, hiring more than a dozen observers to station at important military stations on various lines to count passengers boarding and alighting. This work has continued for more than three months, and materials have been collected from ticket sellers, ticket inspectors, and other persuaders to compile a comparison table of the total number of passengers and the number of passengers with tickets. The basis for this is the average daily figures over the past three months for the 250-odd buses of the company operating on 15 lines throughout the city: (1) The number of passengers buying tickets on the route is 200,527. (2) The number of passengers holding monthly tickets is 11,296. (3) The number of passengers actually observed is 300,626. Subtracting the number of passengers buying tickets on the route and those holding monthly tickets from the number of passengers actually observed, the difference (the number of passengers without tickets) accounts for 41.9 percent of the total number. (This includes the navy, army, air force, combined transport, military police, police, company employees or employees of the same industry, and a small amount of omissions.) Military personnel account for more than 33 percent. It is also heard that the situations on the transportation lines belonging to the British Tramway Company and the French Water and Electricity Company are similar, and those companies are also conducting statistics. The government authorities also attach great importance to the issue of military personnel riding without tickets and will find ways to improve it.</p>

<h3>How Deeply are the Stone Figures Misleading? - Someone Actually Writes to the Police Bureau - Willing to Build a Temple for Worship at Own Expense</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] Even after the plaque of the stone figures was removed, pious men and women still went to burn incense and worship. The police officers stationed there tried their best to dissuade them, but their efforts were futile. The day before yesterday, someone even hung up two plaques with the words "Answers All Prayers." These plaques were removed again yesterday. The police bureau also received a letter yesterday from a woman named "Xu Ya," requesting permission to move the stone figures to a suitable location at her own expense and build a temple for public worship. Her submission contained a remarkable passage: "Upon investigation, Buddhism has been in our country for thousands of years and has endured for a long time. This is a matter of religion and should not be abolished abruptly. To maintain the dignity of Buddhism, improve the appearance of the city, and facilitate traffic, the best of both worlds is to relocate to a suitable building. This would provide a place for devout citizens to worship and also achieve the goals of improving appearances." According to the address provided at the end of the letter, 76 Lane, 12 Baker Road, the reporter went to investigate yesterday afternoon. The address is a law firm owned by Shen Ronghua. At the time, people were playing mahjong in the reception room. When asked if there was a person named Xu Ya, they all said they did not know.

<h3>Only a Thousand or So Japanese Remaining in Shanghai - Stable Life, No Desire to Return - Housing Problems Are the Most Distressing</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] According to sources in the relevant departments, after the victory, the number of Japanese who remained in the city, after being repatriated successively, as of now, there are still 1,011 people remaining. (Including 40 women who married Chinese men and 73 women who married Chinese men.) Among them, 445 people actually participate in the work of retained agencies, and the rest are family members. They have a "Japanese Liaison Office" in Yifeng Lane, Wusong Road, responsible for conveying all orders from the Shanghai Police Headquarters' Japanese Management Section. Among the retained institutions, the textile industry has the most, accounting for about one-third of the retained Japanese. These technicians have generous treatment and a stable life, so even some have surplus funds for savings. Others are engaged in the work of machinery, fishing, and other institutions. Most of these thousand or so Japanese had lived in the city before the war, the longest having a history of fifty years, and the average being around twenty years. They are addicted to Shanghai and have no desire to return to their homeland. Communication with their home country is very convenient, but all incoming and outgoing mail must be carefully checked by the Police Bureau's Japanese Management Section. The most distressing thing for them now is that housing disputes occur frequently. Although the housing allocation is handled by the municipal government, some people in certain institutions still rely on force to seize enemy property houses managed by the Central Trust Bureau that are occupied by Japanese. If the authorities intervene slightly, they are often blamed by those people for not protecting the Japanese, making those who deal with such disputes feel very difficult. Regarding the claim that Taiwanese or Koreans are hiding in the city as Japanese, after a thorough investigation by the police bureau, it is said that the number is very small, and they have all been arrested and brought to justice.</p>

<h3>Seeking to Regulate Military Life - Racing to Build Mobile Service Vehicles - Painting Maitreya Buddha - Inscribing "Everyone Rejoices" - Huang Renlin Talks About the Military Recreation Program</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] The reporter visited General Huang Renlin at the Lizhi Society yesterday to discuss the issue of military recreation in detail. Mr. Huang recently served as Deputy Commander of the Joint Operations Headquarters and Director of the Special Service Department. These were established on April 19th of this year, specializing in the recreation and welfare of the troops. The significance of the establishment is twofold: to boost morale and to enliven the mood of the military. Mr. Huang mentioned that recent incidents of military personnel causing disputes while watching plays in the city were regrettable. He also said: The Special Service Department should be responsible for this.</p>
<p>To actively promote the military recreation program, the Department recently consulted with 29 domestic film manufacturers in the city and plans to borrow the original films of each film manufacturer and reduce them into 16mm versions for military entertainment screenings, with the principle of not hindering the film manufacturers' business. Each film manufacturer expressed great sympathy. Luo Xuelian of China Film Co. was the first to accept, but this has not completely solved the difficulties. The production of reduced versions takes a long time, and screening venues are also yet to be found. For a more permanent solution,</p>
<p>Trial Assembly of Four Vehicles to be Completed by the End of the Month</p>
<p>The Department is now actively designing and building multiple mobile service vehicles. Each vehicle is equipped with various recreational and welfare facilities, including cinema, broadcasting, music, slides, singing, books, lectures, reports, exhibitions, guidance, postal and telecommunications, first aid, drama, letter writing, spiritual guidance, comfort, sports, purchasing, delegation, and games. Due to the high mobility of this vehicle, in addition to major cities, it can also penetrate into the various bandit suppression areas of the country to serve the troops, thereby regulating military life. The first batch of vehicles is planned to be 40 vehicles. Four are currently being assembled for trial use and are expected to be completed before the end of the month.</p>
<p>Technical Personnel Intensifying Training</p>
<p>The reporter obtained a draft design yesterday. The vehicle is a converted universal passenger car. The interior is equipped with various recreational equipment. The vehicle body is painted with a large Maitreya Buddha image, with five soldiers laughing and holding hands around the Maitreya Buddha. Below is inscribed "Everyone Rejoices." Mr. Huang said: This is the slogan of the Special Service Department. According to reports, the U.S. military has a Special Service organization that serves with the army and has achieved remarkable results. The establishment of the Special Service Department is modeled after this, and it is still in its infancy. Therefore, there is a great shortage of technical personnel. To intensify training, a Special Service School has been established on Shuidao Road in the city. One hundred students above the rank of general will be drawn from various units to intensify training in the required subjects. The first phase will start on June 1st and officially open on June 14th. After graduating in six months, they will be assigned to travel with the vehicles to provide services.</p>

After the mayor firmly persuaded him to stay, Mr. Ren now feels that there are many difficulties in handling this task, and it is not easy to achieve the satisfactory results expected by all parties. Therefore, he submitted another request to the mayor yesterday to resign and asked to send someone to replace him as soon as possible.</p>

<h3>Designated Bank Subcommittee Meeting - Discusses the Absorption of Overseas Remittances - Still Handled in Accordance with Circular No. 134</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] The issue of absorbing overseas remittances was discussed by the designated bank foreign exchange subcommittee. Due to too many technical difficulties, no concrete results were achieved. The designated banks are now temporarily handling it in accordance with the provisions of Circular No. 134, that is, for overseas remittances, the Central Bank will issue a special foreign exchange settlement certificate, and then the designated bank will sell it on behalf of the payee at the market price, and hand over the sum of the market price and the official exchange rate to the payee. Yesterday, the market price of the foreign exchange settlement certificate was around 400,000 yuan, and the total with the official exchange rate was 874,000 yuan, which is still far from the black market price. Therefore, the outside world believes that the new foreign exchange settlement system can stimulate exports, but it may be difficult to succeed in absorbing overseas remittances.</p>
<h3>Rice Prices Continue to Rise in North and South Cities - But the Trend is Slightly More Moderate Than the Previous Day</h3>
<p>The rice market continued the upward trend of the previous day at the opening yesterday, seeing further gains. Due to loose monetary conditions and high tin prices, coupled with a reduction in arrivals, cargo owners were able to raise prices more easily. The morning market saw a rise of 300,000 yuan, and the asking price for white japonica rice once approached 8 million. However, the market was hesitant due to the high price, and increased selling as prices rose, so it turned downwards after opening. The North City market closed with white japonica rice at 7.8 million. Early season indica rice and other varieties rose by 150,000 or 200,000 yuan compared to the previous day. The extra high quality japonica rice market also saw high prices followed by lower prices, and ultimately a slight increase of 50,000 yuan. However, high-quality white glutinous rice has reached the 8 million mark. Arrivals in the two markets were registered at 4,796 dan.</p>
<p>Flour The early market was tight for a while, rising by 100,000 yuan, but after a brief surge, it fell back. Old Che flour opened at a high price of 2.45 million, but then news spread that the Central Trust Bureau had resumed selling flour, and selling increased sharply. Old Army flour retreated to 2.35 million at closing, while "Warship" flour retreated to 2.33 million yuan, all to break even. "Red Bee" and "Jiancheng" flour fell by 20,000 yuan. The Central Trust Bureau's selling price was 2.25 million delivered, 50 bags per household. Bran was purchased by customers and rose by 100,000. Wheat buyers and factories did not agree on prices and did not trade.</p>
<p>Grains All turned down. Cargo owners, considering that the previous day's price was too high, could not help but think of the risks as prices rose. Moreover, as rice prices and other commodities have stabilized, public sentiment has turned weak, and sellers have sold at high prices. Soybeans fell by more than 100,000, with Hankou broad beans closing at 2.08 million. Northern buyers were not interested in corn, which fell by 250,000. New green and white broad beans arrivals increased, falling by 150,000. Red sorghum followed, falling by 200,000, and new glutinous wheat also fell by 100,000 yuan. Sesame seeds and raw kernels alone were firm, with the former being purchased by Tianjin buyers and the latter having limited arrivals and inventory.</p>
<p>Edible Oil Prices fluctuated. Due to the rising prices in Qingdao and the few arrivals of other raw oils, Jibao raw oil rose to 21.5 million, an increase of 600,000. Soybean oil, due to falling soybean prices, saw factories selling a lot, and scattered sellers also sold a lot, falling by 400,000 to 500,000. At closing, prices turned up, with soybean oil closing at 17.5 million yuan. Raw sesame oil followed raw Shandong oil, rising by 500,000, and small batch sesame oil rose by 500,000 with purchases from Tianjin. Soybean cake fell by 50,000 first, then increased with many low-priced sales, pushing up prices by 10,000 to 20,000.</p>

<h3>Northeastern Athletes Want to Return But Cannot; Dongxing Basketball Team Established; Announcement of the Establishment Process Is Moving; Will Go to Various Places to Perform to Awaken the People of the Country</h3>
<p>Another new star has emerged in the city's basketball scene. The Dongxing Basketball Team was officially announced yesterday. The team is based on the northeastern elite team "Northeast Wind" and is joined by basketball players from Jilin, Harbin and other provinces and cities. The "Northeast Wind" is the champion of North China and represented Shenyang City in the previous National Games. It also achieved the great feat of winning ten consecutive victories in Pingjin last year. Its skills are pure and its strength is abundant. In this National Games, the team represented Shenyang City. When they went south, they went through hardships. When the conference ended, the hometowns of the team members had been captured by bandits, and they had no way to return. Therefore, Wang Yongfang, Zhang Pu, Tian Fuhai, Wei Qikun, Meng Xiancheng, Bai Chunyu and others initiated and were assisted by Yao Zhizhong, Wei Zhenkui, and Wang Lan to decide to organize the Dongxing Basketball Team to encourage training and then go to various parts of the country to conduct friendly matches to awaken the people of the country to pay attention to the current situation in the Northeast. At the same time, Xu Jincheng, representative of Jilin National Games, Wang Shide of Harbin, Yao Zhizhong and Zhang Zhidong of the Air Force, and Cao Zhiji of the United Nations also participated, so a new basketball force with a patriotic spirit was born. The full list of the team is as follows:</p>
<p>Wei Zhenkui, Wang Lan (Advisors), Yao Zhizhong (Leader), Wang Shenzhe, Wang Chenghou (Management) Wei Qikun (General Affairs Officer), Wang Shide (Publicity), Tian Fuhai (Accounting), Wang Yongfang (Cashier), Qian Xucang (Instructor), Wang Yongfang (Captain), Zhang Pu (Vice Captain), Tian Fuhai, Wei Qikun, Meng Xiancheng, Cao Zhiji, Wang Shide, Bai Chunyu, Yao Zhizhong, Zhang Zhidong, Xu Jincheng.</p>
<h3>East Star Public Announcement</h3>
<p>This team, in order to briefly express its purpose, issues a public announcement stating: "Since the victory, the Northeast, which had been沦陷 for fourteen years, has returned to the embrace of the motherland. Just as we celebrated the 光复, we suffered again from the 赤祸. Black waters and white mountains are shrouded in battle clouds. Fertile plains are strewn with skeletons. Industry and commerce are destroyed by artillery fire, and rural areas are devastated by the smoke of war. The people groan under violence and licentiousness, stretching their necks and waiting for deliverance. Although the 戡乱 army has risen, opening a glimmer of hope, the flames of rebellion still rage, awaiting the concerted efforts of all.</p>
<p>"Upon investigation, the Northeast athletes at this All-China Games, braving dangers, either escaped from the occupied Jilin or broke through the encirclement of Changchun, carrying their luggage on their shoulders and walking thousands of miles. Their faces were covered in dirt, and they disguised themselves as merchants or mingled with beggars. Across countless mountains and passes, their hands and feet were calloused. They slept under the stars and moon, and walked in the wind and snow. Sometimes they were detained by the bandit army, and their lips were parched. Sometimes they were coveted by roaming bandits, and their baggage was emptied. After weeks and months, they finally arrived in Shenyang, starving and freezing. Amidst the choking sobs of the elders, they gathered the athletes and flew south with heavy hearts.</p>
<p>"However, the athletes, having endured hardship and danger to participate in the National Games, did not come merely to demonstrate their skills and win banners. They truly wish to use their strong bodies to show the people of the nation that, although the youth of the Northeast are in dire straits, their blood still boils, and they are willing to give their all for the motherland. Now that the All-China Games have ended, and the flames of war in the Northeast are still raging, most of the athletes' hometowns have fallen into bandit areas, and their wives and children are separated and have no way to contact them. They cry out to the heavens, wanting to return but having no way to do so. Therefore, they have gathered more than ten basketball players and formed a basketball team, named East Star. After careful planning, they plan to go to various places at home and abroad to hold friendly matches, so that the current situation in the Northeast will always resonate in the minds of the people of the nation, to promote sincere unity and complete the great cause of 戡乱 and nation-building. However, since each team member escaped danger alone and has no funds, we would like to ask all officials and sports-loving gentlemen to provide financial assistance so that this Northeast basketball team, which has wandered thousands of miles, can develop in Shanghai. This would be a meaningful and delightful undertaking."</p>
<h3>This Year's Tennis Committee to Hold First Meeting</h3>
<p>The third Tennis Committee of the Shanghai Municipal Sports Association has been appointed by the Chairman of the Board. Zhao Minheng has been re-elected as the Chairman of the Committee. In addition to Rong Deqi, Cheng Yize, Zhang Zizhen, and Guo Qida, who will continue to serve as members, Feng Jiaozhun and Jiang Huaiqing have been newly appointed as members.

<h3>World Games Delegation to Depart in Three Batches</h3>
<p>Regarding the transportation arrangements for our World Games delegation, the China National Aviation Corporation has offered preferential treatment, as reported yesterday. However, some newspapers have reported that the World Games delegation did not accept the preferential treatment offered by CNAC. This is not true. The World Games delegation issues the following statement:</p>
<p>"Our country's delegation to the World Games will depart in three batches. (1) The 20-member soccer team departed at the end of April, traveling through various ports in Southeast Asia and India, playing matches along the way, and then heading to England. (2) The approximately 15-member basketball team is currently training in Beijing, preparing to fly from Shanghai to the Philippines on CNAC planes at the end of this month, and then transfer to other planes to travel through Singapore to England. (3) The remaining delegates, due to their duties, are scheduled to depart from Shanghai in early July, traveling through the United States to England. The above itineraries have been decided long ago, and the China Travel Service and Thomas Cook have been entrusted to handle the booking procedures. It has also been agreed that all athletes will return home on CNAC planes from Calcutta, India. The reports in some newspapers that our delegation did not accept the preferential treatment offered by CNAC are inconsistent with the facts. We are deeply concerned that this will cause misunderstandings in the outside world, and we hereby issue this announcement."</p>

<h3>Eight Thousand Li of Cloud and Moon</h3>
<p>— Yan Zhewu</p>
<p>— Sending Yu Shangyuan as a Representative to Attend the International Theatre Conference</p>
<p>The International Theatre Institute, whose purpose is to "promote mutual understanding between nations," was proposed by Mr. Priestley and other members of the Literature and Art Group at the first General Assembly of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization in November 1946. They wanted to discuss a "concrete plan to safeguard peace from an artistic standpoint," believing that "theatre is the most powerful cultural education and guidance tool among the vast masses of the world." Therefore, it should cooperate closely with the international theatre community, regularly convene meetings of international theatre experts, and organize an International Theatre Institute. As a result, at the 1947 meeting, it was decided to hold a meeting in Prague, Czechoslovakia, in May 1948. A temporary executive committee of the International Theatre Institute was first established to prepare for the meeting. At the same time, letters were sent to the Chinese theatre community, hoping that a branch organization would be established in the Far East and that a formal representative would be sent to attend the first International Theatre Conference. - This conference was rescheduled to be held in Prague, Czechoslovakia, on June 28 of this year.</p>
<p>On the Chinese side, due to the urging of Mr. Huxley, Mr. Kuerz, and others, we established the Chinese branch of the International Theatre Institute and elected the attending representative - that is, the chairman of the branch, Mr. Yu Shangyuan.</p>
<p>Mr. Yu will fly from Shanghai to Hong Kong on the 11th, then to the UK, and then to the Czech Republic to attend the conference. As Representative Yu is about to depart, we will send him our deepest hopes -</p>
<p>1. We hope that our representative will collect as much material as possible on the historical traces of the Chinese theatre community's arduous struggles and glorious sacrifices during the Anti-Japanese War and after the restoration, and present them to theatre friends all over the world. We also hope to accuse the Japanese fascist bandits of persecuting the Chinese theatre community!</p>
<p>2. We hope that our representative will report on the improvement and progress of the performance standards of Chinese spoken drama. It is clear that our theatrical art has made rapid progress in the past decade and has caught up with countries such as England, the United States, France, and the Soviet Union. We should let international theatre friends know the results of our arduous struggle!</p>
<p>3. We hope that our representative will explain the plight of the Chinese theatre community, which has been forced into a low ebb due to the impact of the war. Because one of the tasks of the International Theatre Conference is to "assist the theatre industries of war-torn countries," we do not necessarily need material help, but we would like to receive more sincere "spiritual assistance" from the international theatre community!</p>
<p>4. More importantly, we hope that the representative conference of the International Theatre Institute will have practical and noble achievements, find a true plan to safeguard international peace with artistic power, and hope that our representative can bring back new treasures to save the current crisis of the Chinese theatre movement by borrowing the experience of others.</p>
<p>5. Finally, we hope that the film "Eight Thousand Li of Cloud and Moon," directed by Mr. Shi Dongshan, which records the arduous work of Chinese theatre workers during the Anti-Japanese War, can be transported to Prague and screened during the International Theatre Conference so that international theatre friends can have a more concrete understanding of the difficult living conditions of our theatre friends! (Shanghai, June 7)</p>
<h3>Centipede</h3>
<p>— Li Zi</p>
<p>"It's a disgrace to scholarship that a dignified principal would be so untrustworthy!" Old Mr. Fan's sandy voice burst into the office again. His body swayed, his hands still clasped behind his back, the veins on his forehead bulging, his eyes wide open. Without even taking the time to see what people were writing, (he always lingered by each person's desk whenever he came into the office, looking at what people were writing, even personal letters), (spitting everywhere, he shouted, "Payday was four days ago, and no one's seen a penny yet! We have to argue with reason! Otherwise, we'll really be at their mercy!"</p>
<p>Everyone in the office remained at their "posts": crocheting yarn, marking papers, and even Little Lu kept humming his tune. Two or three students lingered far away outside the window, whispering to each other, but they didn't dare come closer because of the "iron face" of the dean of students.</p>
<p>It's no exaggeration to say that Mr. Fan was old. He's almost seventy this year. In the late Qing Dynasty, he was even a "supplementary student" (but people called him a "scholar"). He's been teaching at this middle school for thirty years and nine months. But he doesn't think he's old. He grew a few long eyebrows when he was sixty, and he says he's lived to be seventy because of these "longevity eyebrows." He eats four bowls of rice at every meal, his eyes and teeth are all good, and his sandy voice can be heard throughout the school when he teaches. He teaches twenty-four hours a week, Chinese and history to three junior high classes each, and he doesn't even give up the two hours of foreign history. Fortunately, he's old and always has notes prepared for class. Who can deny it when he gives a lecture on "The Anglo-Saxons as descendants of the Chu people?" He's going to leave? Ha! Mr. Fan has been teaching here for longer than the age of two students combined.</p>
<p>The principal has even more reasons for not paying salaries: He has a toothache and doesn't come to school, so no pay; his son has a stomachache and is busy seeing a doctor, so no pay; it's raining and he can't get a rickshaw to school, so no pay; he was tired from attending some party yesterday and is taking a day off, so no pay; the bank is only open for half a day on Saturday and he doesn't have time to get the money, so no pay; of course, there's no pay on Sunday; on Monday, he has to go to the chairman of the board's office on business, so no pay… Anyway, most of the teachers are "relatives of the emperor" – the director of teaching affairs is his uncle, the dean of students is his nephew, the director of general affairs is his nephew, and the accountant is his godson… No one dares to speak up, but Mr. Fan often sings a different tune. So every time, they have to appease him first to avoid "trouble." This time, they forgot somehow. Mr. Fan would scold female students for wearing short socks, saying, "The world is going downhill!" How much more so when salaries are deducted, which goes against the way of the sages and shows disrespect to Mr. Fan? Wouldn't that enrage him?</p>
<p>Even if Mr. Fan raged like thunder, no one could stop him. After all, Little Lu joked, "Well, Mr. Fan, you're so virtuous and respected, you could really stand up to him."</p>
<p>"Me?" Mr. Fan was surprised. "Heh, if I were thirty years younger and had a little more fire, I'd give him a piece of my mind!" As he said this, he walked away with his hands behind his back.</p>
<p>The office erupted in laughter as they saw him out.</p>
<p>Actually, Mr. Fan didn't used to be this angry, especially during the five and a half years when he was the director of general affairs. Except for occasionally stomping his feet and scolding the school workers, he always smiled at students, colleagues, and especially the principal, and never got angry. He could take any insults. But ever since that nephew of his, the director of general affairs, followed the principal into office, his temper has gotten worse: If chalk scratches the blackboard, it's the director of general affairs' fault; if there's sand in the rice, what's the general affairs office doing? If teachers have to pay extra for rickshaw fare for their rice ration, that's outrageous! If a desk tears their clothes, the general affairs office has to pay for it; if the color of the textbook is too light, it must be the director of general affairs colluding to cut corners… It never ends. And every time, he always curses loudly, starting with the fact that the director of general affairs' father was a cart driver and a peddler, and continuing until it's a disgrace to scholarship and a harm to his descendants.</p>
<p>Just as one storm had subsided, another one came along half a day later. By chance, a big centipede was found on the female teachers' table during lunch, causing them to scream shrilly. This gave Mr. Fan an even better topic to rant about. He immediately stomped his feet and slammed the table in the dining hall (which was also the office), and the teachers were also stirred up. Except for the two teachers who were directly related to the director of general affairs, everyone else made the director of general affairs the target of their anger, blaming him for the unpaid salaries. They demanded that he immediately ask the principal to come to a meeting. The director of general affairs, who had been put in charge by the principal and only knew how to wear a tie and polish his shoes, had no choice but to tuck his tail between his legs and rush to the principal's residence. The teachers all cursed that the toilet and the kitchen shouldn't be in the same room, but in the end, it was still the centipede's fault for not knowing its place. Mr. Fan was extremely pleased, spitting everywhere, "spitting in every direction."</p>
<p>"Mr. Fan," Little Lu said again, "You can't let up this time! Everyone's going to get rid of that Director Wang, and then we'll want you to take over."</p>
<p>"No, no, not at all," Mr. Fan said, his eyes smiling. "When I was the director of general affairs, I never took a single thing. How can you compare me to these inexperienced young people who immediately become corrupt and illegal? Heh, it's really what they call 'the younger generation is to be feared!'"</p>
<p>"Of course," Little Lu said, "Back then, we had fish and meat at every meal. If it weren't for your old scholar's integrity, could we have done that?"</p>
<p>"We are people who are well-versed in the teachings of the sages…" Mr. Fan spat even further. "Can we be compared to these cart drivers and peddlers?"</p>
<p>"Hahaha…" Little Lu laughed.</p>
<p>"Hahaha…" Mr. Fan also laughed.</p>
<p>The principal naturally couldn't refuse to come. As soon as he arrived, the dining hall immediately fell silent. Ignoring the fact that there were still classes in the afternoon, he immediately called a meal meeting. Before the meeting, he asked Mr. Fan to come to his office for a few private words. The three square tables in the dining hall were put together to form a conference room.</p>
<p>Of course, the principal was the chairman, and of course, the principal spoke first:</p>
<p>"...Director of General Affairs, Mr. Wang, is young and doesn't know much, and he doesn't have experience in running the meals. I think that in the future, we should let our colleagues organize a food committee themselves to manage the meals. I don't know if everyone agrees."</p>
<p>Silence, passed.</p>
<p>"However, I have a humble opinion," Mr. Fan proposed. "Food is our nature. Everyone wants to eat well, but they also want to eat cheaply. I want both bear's paws and fish, but I can't have both. If you want it cheap, you can only have a basket of rice and a gourd of water, and Hui doesn't change his joy. If you want to eat well, we teachers have meager salaries and can't afford it. However, when Heaven is about to entrust a great mission to a person, it must first exhaust his mind, temper his body, and burden his skin. That's my opinion. What do you think?"</p>
<p>"That's best," the principal said. "Everyone wants it good and cheap, but it's also a fact that we can't afford it. I think it doesn't matter if the vegetables are a little bad, because saving money for everyone is never wrong. As long as it's clean and affordable, that's all that matters. What do you all think?"</p>
<p>Silence, no objection, passed. "Then I think we should form a food committee! Mr. Fan is old and virtuous and has experience in running the meals, so let's ask him to be the chairman of the food committee."</p>
<p>"That, that, how can that be?" Mr. Fan declined with a face full of shame.</p>
<p>"Don't be modest," the principal said. "I think everyone has always admired Mr. Fan, and if the public recommends you, it's not good to refuse."</p>
<p>"In that case, I can only accept it with shame," Mr. Fan said, bowing to everyone.</p>
<p>"I think," the principal said, "Two more food committee members will be enough. One is Director of General Affairs, Mr. Wang, who will be convenient for contacting various matters. And another one - I think Mr. Lu will be good. What do you all think?"</p>
<p>Silence, complete agreement, passed.</p>
<p>"Okay," the chairman said. "Starting tomorrow, the meals will be taken over by the food committee. The salaries for this month were supposed to be paid today, but this morning, I had a visit from someone who is a director in Nanjing, so I accompanied him all morning. After eating, I was just about to go to the bank to get the money when Mr. Wang came to call me. I didn't have time to go, so we'll issue them tomorrow. With the salaries issued, it will be easier to run the meals. Rice should be bought immediately, and oil and firewood can be purchased a little cheaper if possible. If Mr. Fan doesn't make contact, then please Mr. Wang make the arrangements."</p>
<p>The twenty dan of rice bought at the beginning of the semester had only about five dan eaten. The principal had said that it was bought for the teachers first. There were also several boxes of oil and dozens of bundles of firewood, which of course were not included in the "transfer" list. Prices had jumped threefold, but no one dared to ask a question.</p>
<p>"Anything else to propose?" The principal pulled out his big gold pocket watch and looked at it. After waiting for about half a minute, he announced, "No proposals, meeting adjourned."</p>
<p>The entire meeting lasted ten and eight and a half minutes. End.</p>
<p>"This is a piece of bacon bone," Mr. Fan secretly said to Little Lu when they were discussing the future meal plans that evening. "You young people don't know, but when the burden is put on you, you have to do it."</p>
<p>Little Lu smiled knowingly, without saying a word, not laughing or singing his tune.</p>
<p>Mr. Fan was old after all. Since becoming the chairman of the food committee, his temper had really decreased a lot. He didn't even get angry at the director of general affairs when there were fewer pages in the textbook, but instead said that the students were too narrow-minded. He hadn't been heard talking about "scholarship," and the "sand" in his voice was lighter when he taught because he wasn't speaking with as much force, allowing the students' laughter and the sound of "paper bullets" to drown it out. But he didn't show his age at all in running the meals. He was even more enthusiastic in serving than his nephew, the director of general affairs.</p>

<h3>Two Essays</h3>
<p>— Jia Chen</p>
<p>Ode to Water Foam</p>
<p>I carry the heavy burden of life: I look up and gaze at the arduous path ahead, only to see layers of thick fog and bursts of fishy odor; the feelings of terror and timidity almost make me lose the courage and determination to grope forward.</p>
<p>I carry the heavy burden of life: I walk to the water's edge, leaning against an old pine tree, staring at the ever-changing clouds; the clouds symbolize this matter, and also symbolize life. Suddenly I look down, and the calm water surface is rippling with silver pearl-like foam, resisting the impact of the waves. It rises and falls, each tiny water foam tightly linked together. The more violent the impact of the waves, the more water foam gathers; continuing to resist, continuing to struggle, and in its struggle and resistance, it is showing the flow of the river. In an instant, the silver pearl-like foam has turned into a snow-white wave. - Then I remembered the ancients saying: "Time passes like this! Never ceasing day and night." The flow of water is like the fleeting of time, and the water foam and waves are the brilliance of life; therefore, only constant action can prove the truth of life.</p>
<p>I carry the heavy burden of life: With a smile on my lips, I leave the lonely pine tree and move forward to face the arduous path. I hold the greatest determination, which is this, step after step, row upon row, learning the spirit of water foam!</p>
<p>I carry the heavy burden of life: I hear the waterfall roaring in the mountainside, like an impatient old man, shouting to his companions in a majestic voice to wash away the dirt in the mountains because he cannot stand the filth in the mountains and forests. I also see the silver pearl-like water foam, longing for the cleanliness and brightness of the mountain rocks and tree roots after they have been washed clean, happily dancing with its companions. Doing cleaning work in the mountains.</p>
<p>I carry the heavy burden of life: I walk to the top of the mountain to greet the morning sun. I want to see the morning sun shine on the mountainside and the foot of the mountain, on the streamside and the riverside, I want to see the water foam dancing in the morning sun, silver pearls turning into ten thousand golden stars, illuminating the dark earth and washing away the filth of the world.</p>
<p>I carry the heavy burden of life, and excitedly walk to the bright earth, to the human world. Like a pilgrim to the mountains, I piously explore the true and beautiful life, step by step, row upon row. It is midnight; everything is silent, and the earth has fallen asleep. I bathe in the moonlight, dragging my tired steps, still continuing to move forward. As long as there is still a bay of flowing water in this world; a few drops of water foam, I will always be patient and happy. I want to find the waterfront, scoop up a handful of clear spring water to wash away the wind dust on my face and heart; I want to sit by the dam, letting the breeze blow away my fatigue; I want to lie down and listen carefully to the gentle and moving voice of the water foam; I want it to tell me again the story of its friend who is not stained by the mud. The mud shows destruction, and also foreshadows new life!</p>
<p>In the blink of an eye, the east is slightly white, I leap up with this beautiful story and light steps. In the sound of the crowing of the rooster, I run towards dawn.</p>
<h3>Shadow</h3>
<p>Every night, rain or shine, I always have to walk around the secluded streets for a lap, and I have been in this habit for almost a year. Walking on the dark street, I seem to have broken away from reality and galloped in the realm of my heart, I call this leisure enjoyment; it is also a kind of experience.</p>
<p>The streets are quiet, the night is cool as water, and occasionally a streetcar whizzes by, making a sharp sound; but this does not detract from the beauty of the night, and everything is even quieter, so quiet that you can only hear your own footsteps treading on the flat road, making a rustling sound.</p>
<p>The cat-eyed streetlights are shining a circle of dim yellow halo, and accompanying me is the dark shadow that shakes beside me, following my steps. Although it never speaks; I know it is my confidant, it understands me as much as I understand it. I turn my head slightly to peek at it, it is so dignified, using a silent attitude to point out my mistakes and criticize my cowardice. Under its questioning, I can't answer anything; besides acquiescing, I only feel a heavier heart. I can't listen anymore, I want to escape it. So I quickly accelerated my pace, and when I stopped at the corner, wanting to take a breath, it was by my side again.</p>
<p>I bowed my head and continued walking, my heart pounding violently. The evening wind blew against my face, and I felt a cool breeze; I heard a gentle tone saying, "Combine thought and action; those who are unwilling to be slaves will not perish!" With shame and gratitude, I was so moved that I couldn't help but shed tears.</p>
<p>In a hazy mood, I was standing at the door of my house; preparing to push the door in, I timidly reached out my hand to say goodbye to it. But, I don't know when it was gone, only the door light widened its eyes and stared at me strangely.</p>

<h3>Recent Developments in the World of Literature</h3>
<p>— Zhao Jingshen</p>
<p>Recently, the number of playwrights in the Swedish capital has been greater than during wartime. They have not been disappointed, and the Royal Theatre of Stockholm has staged many extremely interesting plays. This theatre is supported by the government and is one of the best in Europe, receiving an annual subsidy of 90,000 yuan from the government. However, the theatre also relies on box office revenue, generating an additional 350,000 yuan annually. With this funding, they stage plays ranging from modern American, French, and English works all the way to Shakespeare, at prices much lower than on Broadway in America.</p>
<p>The Royal Theatre began its theatrical season with "Life With Father," directed by Stig Torslow. This season lasts for five or six months, although critics felt that the play was not worthy of being performed at the national theatre. "Castle of Silk" (Silkeborg), a play written by Kjell Abell with the occupation of Denmark as its theme, received extreme praise from critics, perhaps due to sympathy for their Scandinavian sister nation outweighing the play's actual merit. The play was written shortly after the occupation of Denmark and published quickly, recalling Denmark in 1900 with a mixture of realism and symbolism.</p>
<p>The second play staged was Hjalmar Bergman's "Markurells I Wadkoping, 1979," which is purely Swedish in character, set against the backdrop of a small town. The central figure, Markurells, is a cave-dwelling, goblin-like ugly man, outwardly crude and boastful, but extremely sensitive and deeply in love with his only son. He is deceived and ridiculed by everyone, even his wife, who has never told him the child is not his. Just before the boy is about to graduate from high school, Markurells discovers the truth, and his heart breaks. But when the boy happily passes his exam, the first thing he does is tell his father, shouting, "Father, Father!..." Embracing his father, Markurells forgets all the ridicule he has suffered, moved by this outpouring of affection, and knows now that this child is undoubtedly his son. Anders de Wahl, a famous Swedish romantic actor, now 78 years old, plays the male lead. The play is as popular as it was when it premiered in 1922, because it truly captures the spirit and background of Sweden.</p>
<p>After performing Molière's "The School for Wives" at the Drottningholm Theatre near Stockholm, the Royal Theatre staged "Richard III." Lars Hanson, considered to be the greatest living Swedish actor, played the crippled and arrogant Richard with great power. However, the play was too long, lasting a full four hours, which was exhausting for both the audience and the actors. The play was directed by Alf Sjoberg. Hanson, now 62 years old, had performed this role in the capital 25 years ago and is still as youthful as he was in the original production.</p>
<p>Racine's "Britannicus," directed by Olof Molander, and Cora Sandel's "Krane's Tavern" from Norway, completed the theatrical season.</p>
<p>Other plays performed in various theatres included Shaw's "Man and Superman" and Stig Dagarman's new play "Den Dodsdomde" (The Condemned Man). Dagarman had written three novels and many short stories by the age of 24, but this was his first play. The play is about a male protagonist who is condemned to death for murdering his wife, but in reality, her lover murdered her. He nearly dies but is eventually released. Feeling unjustly judged, he angrily kills a woman, using this as the only loophole to turn himself in again.</p>

<h3>Reader's Opinion: Serving Society or Monopolizing for Profit?</h3>
<p>— A Reader Hopes the Qinghu Long-Distance Bus Company Will Come to Its Senses</p>
<p>To the Editor: Since May, the Shanghai Municipal Public Utilities have increased their prices by 20%, which has been met with fierce criticism. It is also said that the Municipal Council is investigating the accounts of various public utilities and examining the rationality of the price increases, with the aim of preventing further increases. Although the price increase in May has already been implemented, the censure from public opinion and the actions of the Municipal Council have at least given the people some comfort, and have made the various public utilities more cautious about future price increases.</p>
<p>Consider the Qinghu Long-Distance Bus Company in our Qingpu. They enjoy the exclusive right to operate on the Qinghu Road, and their business is thriving. Since May, they have increased their prices by 80%. Fortunately, there is no second company on the road to compete for business, so they can be unscrupulous. They have forgotten that public utilities are monopolies concerning social welfare and the people's livelihoods. This monopoly should be aimed at serving society. Its nature should not be compared to a "trust," and its prices should absolutely not be allowed to monopolize for profit. Unfortunately, Qingpu is a small place with virtually no public opinion, and the County Council exists but is ineffective. I have long admired your newspaper for its efforts to serve society, and I respectfully request that you uphold justice and expose this issue, so that the Qinghu Long-Distance Bus Company will come to its senses and transform from monopolizing for profit to serving society. This would be a great blessing for the common people! From Shi Yuanren, a reader in Qingpu.</p>

<h3>Shanghai Telecommunications Bureau's Response</h3>
<p>[Youth Association Industrial and Commercial Research Group] Telecommunications are closely related to commerce. Providing market information and facilitating communication is essential to industry and commerce. Your bureau serves the public and strives to improve services. Thirty members of our group would like to visit your bureau to understand the actual situation of sending and receiving messages. Is it necessary to apply in advance, and what are the procedures?</p>
<p>[Answer] Our bureau sincerely welcomes public visits, but for the convenience of reception, visits are limited to groups and organizations. You can directly go to the Public Service Group, Room 308, Fuzhou Road, to fill out an application form, so that we can arrange a reception date and assign someone from our bureau to provide a tour.</p>
<p>[Li Dingmao from Hengyang Road asks] What is the procedure for attaching gift certificates to social telegrams? Can they be sent from all business offices?</p>
<p>[Answer] The regulations for attaching gift certificates to social telegrams were changed on June 1st to twenty levels, ranging from 50,000 yuan, 100,000 yuan to 1,000,000 yuan. The handling fee is 30,000 yuan for amounts from 50,000 yuan to 500,000 yuan, and 60,000 yuan for amounts from 550,000 yuan to 1,000,000 yuan. Due to limited manpower, sending locations are currently limited to the Fuzhou Road General Office and the Tian Tong Road Zhongshan Road two model business offices.</p>
<p>[Cheng Peiji from Jinling East Road asks] Please add a special telegram receiving point at the Jinling East Road branch office, which will be more convenient for neighboring businesses. I believe your bureau will adopt public opinion and handle this.</p>

<h3>Streamlining Organizations</h3>
<p>— Sun He</p>
<p>Streamlining organizations is, in principle, a praiseworthy endeavor. Too many parallel institutions and overlapping structures not only waste national funds but also give ordinary people the feeling that there are too many "parent officials." It is not a small problem for the "subjects" to "support" them with "coarse food," and it often leads to confusion. Public affairs are often like a football, kicked back and forth, and a matter that could be resolved in three days may take three months to complete.</p>
<p>However, there are two points worth noting that accompany this move:</p>
<p>Where will the personnel go after the organizations are reduced? Eating is a problem. It seems that this large group of people cannot be allowed to be idle and unemployed.</p>
<p>Streamlining organizations is a step towards improving political efficiency, but it is not the same as improving political efficiency. It also depends on whether the work is being done diligently and whether bureaucratic practices are reduced to a minimum. Reducing the amount of water can certainly make the medicine more concentrated, but if the medicine is not changed, the disease will not go away.</p>
<h3>Too Much Historical Data</h3>
<p>— Mei Bai</p>
<p>The biggest difficulty a historian often encounters is the lack of historical data, making it impossible to write with any basis. After World War II, the situation was exactly the opposite. It is said that there is simply too much historical data, making it impossible to know where to start.</p>
<p>The U.S. government's archives recently released some figures: From the beginning of U.S. history until the attack on Pearl Harbor, the government preserved archives occupying approximately 700,000 cubic feet. However, since the attack on Pearl Harbor, the archives sent by various units and government departments alone already occupy more than 18 million cubic feet. After the Tokyo war crimes trials are completed, it is feared that there will be a large number of archives to come. Among these vast documents, some are indeed of great value, but many are meaningless. To carefully identify them is not an easy task.</p>
<p>In fact, American historians saw this point in the early stages of the war, so they suggested to President Roosevelt that special war history commissioners be assigned to various units and government agencies. All archives and other historical materials would first be edited and organized by them. This suggestion was adopted and implemented immediately, but personnel disputes in various agencies were quite fierce. Those involved tried to cover up their mistakes as much as possible, and when pointing fingers at others, they often fabricated stories without any basis in fact. For example, one of the agencies with the most disputes was the War Production Board. Several leaders disagreed from the beginning and continued to argue until Japan surrendered, without interruption. Even when writing personal memoirs, they are still attacking each other. And when the "historical commissioner" of the War Production Board wanted to gather some facts from all sides, he was met with resistance everywhere. The answer he often received was: "These matters are not related to the public and do not need to be recorded."</p>
<p>The situation in the military was the same, but the crux of the problem was simpler: Anything unfavorable to the unit commander was not made public. Even if a general made a very obvious mistake, so that the general public had already realized that he should be held responsible for a particular setback, the unit still strictly adhered to the creed of "concealing evil and promoting good," and would never reveal the true relevant materials.</p>
<p>In addition to these archives, the memoirs of famous people are naturally extremely important. Memoirs have been published by Churchill, Hull, Bernays, and Stimson. Many deceased dignitaries, such as Hopkins and General Stilwell, have had their biographies compiled by others, which have also been completed one by one. They were on the scene, so what they say should carry weight, but even with Bernays' "Speaking Frankly," Dewey, the Governor of New York, who is the most promising candidate for the next presidential election, said that Bernays was the most ignorant Secretary of State for international relations in American history! And the biases of Churchill and Stilwell are even more well-known.</p>
<p>In addition, the number of letters between American presidents is also truly astounding. For example, former President Taft had approximately one million letters preserved in the Library of Congress. In addition, there are 15,000 pages of the president's own diary, all in densely arranged small characters. But Taft is like a small witch compared to Roosevelt (referring to F.D.R, not Theodore Roosevelt). The letters of Roosevelt now preserved in the Hyde Park residence and the Library of Congress would stretch for miles in bookshelves, causing ambitious historians to only sigh with frustration.</p>
<h3>More Talk on Letters</h3>
<p>— Zheng Yimei</p>
<p>Contemporary people who use self-made stationery for their letters are not uncommon. For example, Chen Kuilong used longevity character stationery, with a longevity character in the middle and the words "Made by Yong Sou in the fifth month of Bingzi, at the age of eighty" on the side. It was narrow and long, intended for use as a memo. Zhu Fengwei used Nengyin Huxiao Guan stationery, Gu Dingmei used Jin Jiashi Haoqi stationery, She Jingao used San Dingyi stationery, Chen Julai used An Te stationery, Wu Hufan used Lv Bian Chitang Cao Ci stationery, Ye Yuhu used Xia An stationery, Zhou Shoujuan used Zi Luolan Tan stationery, Zhao Mianyun used Xin Han Ge stationery, Zhang Biwu used Bi Wu Tong Guan stationery, Zhou Meiquan used Jin Jue Yi stationery, Gao Chuiwan used Ge Yi stationery, Chen Meng'an used Ren Fangyi stationery, Huang Yunong used Zhe Xiang Guan stationery, and Wu Meisun used Han Paoyi stationery. Others include Chen Zihe's Baiye Guan stationery, Tang Qilin's Xiu Haiqi stationery, Ling Xu's Mang Wu Qingzhai stationery, Chao Zhangfu's Haitian Lou stationery, Chen Congzhou's Sui Yue Lou stationery, and Yu Huishu's Feng Bu Ning Qi stationery, the list is endless.</p>
<p>Many of my friends are painters, and they often use plain stationery to draw one or two branches of flowers on it before writing a letter, such as Shang Shengbo and Yao Yuqin. Deng Chunshu even uses fan-shaped paper, as if writing a note on the fan, which is particularly unique.</p>
<p>To commemorate my deceased friends, I have specially mounted their letters and titled them "The Lament of Human and Qin." Initially, there were only more than ten people, including the master of Shuliu Shanfang, Bi Jian, Li Hanqiu, Yu Tiansui, Zhu Yuanchu, Wang Junqing, Xu Zhiyan, Jiang Zhuchao, Tao Baopi, Wang Meiyin, Sun Shishun, and Wu Shuangshu. Who would have known that in a few years, hundreds of them would pass away? Occasionally, when I check them, I cannot help but feel sad and nostalgic for the past.</p>
<p>The ancients said that one should not reject words because of the person. I do not reject letters because of the person. I have also collected several letters from Wang Jingwei, Wang Shulu, Chu Minyi, and the master of Yuanju Pavilion. I still regret missing the letters of Zhu Huo and Huang Qiuyue, because Qiuyue's handwriting was particularly exquisite.</p>
<p>I have letters from eminent monks such as Yinguang, Hongyi, and Taixu; elderly scholars from the Hanlin Academy, such as Yu Biyun, Zhi Xin Jian, Shen Qiquan, Shang Yanying, Qian Ziyan, Wu Yinpei, Lu Fengshi, Zhang Yanchang, and Cheng Zongyi; and foreign people, such as the Japanese artist Hashimoto Kansetsu, who wrote in Chinese with a brush. These are the unique features of my collected letters.</p>
<h3>Zhao Guni Died from Pufferfish</h3>
<p>— Qian Dacheng</p>
<p>I previously revealed anecdotes about Zhao Guni in Free Talk. Yesterday, I met my uncle-in-law Wang Jiyu, who had a deep friendship with Guni, and he told me that the reason for Guni's death was actually due to his lack of restraint in eating. My uncle-in-law heard that Guni was ill, so he went to visit him and saw Guni busy整理 arranging his lifelong printed seal collection. My uncle-in-law said to him, "You are sick, why don't you take it easy?" Guni said, "I am just using it to pass the time!" Then he smiled and said to my uncle-in-law, "My favorite food is now on the market again." My uncle-in-law knew it was pufferfish and quickly warned Guni, "You are sick, be sure not to eat this stuff!" He nodded casually. A few days later, he heard that Guni was getting sicker, so he visited him again and said to Guni, "You must have eaten pufferfish!" He smiled and said, "I only ate a little, and my family took it away. How can it be so effective." Not long after, Guni died.</p>
<p>Initially, Guni also suffered from malaria and could not recover for a long time, so he filled a large bowl with cold rice, served with cold braised pork, and drank Suiyang Spring (a famous spring in Yushan, in Xiaoyao You) with it; he lay down on the bed and slept soundly, sweating profusely, and then recovered. He often boasted about this to people, calling it a miraculous cure for malaria. A friend told him not to use it as a model, but he did not listen. He eventually lost his life to his curiosity and old age. It is a pity. Otherwise, Guni should have enjoyed a long life because of his health and strength. Why only sixty years? But he was optimistic and resigned to fate. When he was seriously ill, he sighed and said, "I am just a small child from the countryside, traveling with scholars and officials, hunting for fame, and living to be sixty years old. Heaven has not failed me!"</p>
<p>My friend Shen Bao Yi told me: Guni once lived in his house, and when he was carving seals, he liked to eat snacks, especially pine nuts.</p>
<p>Guni also liked to gamble and play mahjong; however, he did not allow people to watch. If someone happened to be watching, he would play the middle, wealth, or white tile that was in pairs or three tiles, and the onlookers would be surprised and say that he had played the wrong tile. Then he would stand up and say, "It is my freedom to deal the cards, and there is no fixed rule? Since you are interested, you can take a seat!" He then left.</p>
<p>Guni liked to climb mountains and visit water, and he was also good at appraising bones and sharks. He obtained Yuan chops in Yangzhou and Han bricks in Hangzhou, and all his funds came from this.</p>
<p>Guni was also good at painting. Mr. Yang Xianyi said that his flowers were very similar to Li Futang.</p>
<p>When Guni was dying, Mr. Yuanxi summarized his life and wrote a twenty-chapter lament, which said, "Shi Ji did not refrain from eating, risking death to eat pufferfish; Reed sprouts gradually grow, and the spring continent cuts off people's souls." "Shi Nong has a strict wind and bones, and harmonizes the light to return to the dust; Although there is an iron gate limit, he is afraid of befriending new dignitaries." Mr. Yang does not easily praise people, so we can know what kind of person Guni was.</p>
<p>Guni died on April 14th of the 22nd year of the Republic of China. He wrote the Bai Yi Lu Seal Collection in forty volumes, and the Ni Daoren Poems in two volumes. Mr. Jin Shuyuan, a fellow villager, wrote his tomb inscription.</p>
<p>It has been fifteen years since Guni died, and there are many who imitate his calligraphy for profit; however, their work is just sheepskin over a tiger, and they cannot capture even one iota of his spirit.</p>
<p>Mr. He Shiqi and his daughter Yiru are currently holding a father-daughter painting and calligraphy exhibition at the Chinese Painting Garden. The picture shows a recent work by Ms. Yiru.</p>
<h3>Onions Cure Diseases</h3>
<p>— Yuchuang</p>
<p>If you pick up a raw onion, peel off the outer layer, and chew it in your mouth for five minutes—your mouth can be said to have been thoroughly disinfected, and all bacteria and microorganisms have disappeared. Sometimes, chewing for just one minute can kill all microorganisms in the mouth. This is the result of recent research by Soviet scholar Dr. Tokin.</p>
<p>Many American scientists have also engaged in research on onions. According to them, although the smell of onions is not very pleasant, the smell itself can kill germs. They have begun to mash onions and use the smell to "fumigate" the inflamed, festering, and painful areas of patients' wounds, often with the effect of relieving pain and reducing swelling, and promoting new flesh. Soviet doctors have also tried to use the smell of onions to treat inflamed and festering wounds. Each time, they use one or two onions, mash them, and place them in a shallow dish, making the area similar to the size of the wound. After "fumigating" for ten minutes, they can reduce swelling and dissolve pus. After "fumigating" twice, new flesh can grow.</p>
<h3>"Xuandang"</h3>
<p>— You Mojun</p>
<p>While monitoring self-study at night, a classmate was reading letters. He asked me what "Xuandang Yuyin" means. I said that "Chun" is used to compare to the father, and "Xuan" is used to compare to the mother. This usage has a long history, so "Xuandang" means mother. When used with "Yuyin," it means that "Chun" is no longer around. According to the poem "How to get Xuan grass, to plant it on the back," there is no doubt that calling the mother "Xuan" comes from the Book of Songs. However, it always feels very inappropriate, because the alias of Xuan grass is "prostitute," see Compendium of Materia Medica!</p>
<p>I think it is more appropriate to respectfully call someone's mother "Zuntang." There is already the phrase "Zuntang Youzhuo" in Lu Shilong's reply to Zhuo Maoan's letter, which can be proved. Otherwise, it is also okay to use "Taifuren." Du Fu's poem has the line "Get up and sit down, Taifuren," which is very generous.</p>
<h3>Self-Inscription on Zhu Bamboo</h3>
<p>— Sanmu</p>
<p>The teacher drew with research ink, wrote bamboo after being drunk,</p>
<p>The brush stroke rushes like a galloping horse, the smell of alcohol sweeps across the seats.</p>
<p>At first glance, it is bright and radiant, like the fire of Luhun,</p>
<p>Zhu Rong throws as he pleases, and many gods and ghosts fall;</p>
<p>Again, he suspected the sorrow of the sad old man, full of blood and tears on paper,</p>
<p>Struggling to advance the liver and intestines, covering his face and weeping like rain.</p>
<p>The guest said that the teacher was drunk, why bother himself,</p>
<p>The teacher replied, no, how can the guest know me?</p>
<p>What world is this? Slaughter is everywhere,</p>
<p>Each with a barbarian heart, their anger refuses to fall,</p>
<p>Not only the disaster of Luhun, but for a long time, the universe has been tossed,</p>
<p>Alas, the vast sky, why does it not care for the suffering people?</p>
<p>I want to eradicate the evil bamboo, the evil bamboo is indeed numerous,</p>
<p>I want to escape the world, where can I be naked,</p>
<p>Writing this is as it should be, I hope the guest will not laugh at me.</p>
<p>After speaking, the guest also realized, and reported with a loud voice that it was okay,</p>
<p>Raising his head to look at the blue sky, he covered all the summers without a word.</p>
<p>###</p>
<p>Reading the twenty portraits of the new cabinet's heads of departments and commissions on the front page of the first day of this month, one by one, seeing the last old hero, I couldn't help but feel nostalgic for the past. This gentleman has a very deep qualification in the officialdom, has experienced a lot, and is still healthy today. Looking at his expression, he is not very old. Judging by his age, he should have passed the age of seventy.</p>
<p>This old hero is an old scholar from fifty years ago (Qian Qing Guangxu Ding Chou 科 in the 23rd year), and he was proud of the court examination and was used as a small Beijing official of the seventh rank, assigned to the Ministry of Justice, and thus entered the judicial field. In the late Qing Dynasty, his career was rising, from Beijing to outside, the old judge had served as the Provincial Judge (that is, Guosi, the third rank, the general meeting of criminal names in a province, the authority of the "blue robe" in the "Yutangchun" three-hall joint trial, which is enough to be realistic, I have detailed textual research on the drama special edition of the Beijing Daily and Tianjin Dagong Daily in Beiping); the new judge served as the Chief of the Higher Court (that is, the President of the Higher Court in the early Republic of China, now the President of the Higher Court). He had a scholar who was also a courtier, an official in the Ministry of Justice, and a fellow Anhui villager, whose name was Wang Shouzhen. The two had a very close friendship, did not forget each other in wealth and honor, and supported each other. When the old Xu served as the Fengtian Higher Court, Wang was also the Heilongjiang Higher Court. In the early years of the Republic of China, Xu and Wang were both senior officials in the judicial field. They were inseparable, and now the old Xu is still young and strong, but Wang has been silent for a long time.</p>
<p>The legal world has always been divided into two factions, one is the old Ministry of Justice, and the other is students studying abroad. The old Ministry of Justice practiced precedents and was familiar with the old laws and case handling experience, such as the above-mentioned Xu Wang and Dong Kang Wang Shitong. Students studying in the East and West oceans are based on the new laws of modern civilization. When the late Qing Dynasty reformed and improved the judiciary due to the corruption of the Daqing Law and the old criminal officials, students studying abroad and talents studying new laws in the country naturally became the pride of the times. However, several old roles in the old Ministry of Justice also held important positions during the transition period of the former Qing Dynasty, and they also studied new knowledge, were good at administration, so although the graduates were widely used as judges and officials in the early years of the Republic of China, several chiefs still needed old masters, such as the old Xu, who was appointed as the Minister of Justice in the first year of the Republic of China, because he was quite famous in the three northeastern provinces in the late Qing Dynasty, and Xu Shichang was between the old Yuan and the old Duan, and was highly regarded. However, his initial knowledge of the old Xu was due to a special manifestation of the police affairs. At the time of Li in the Qing Dynasty, the Qing court initially established the police administration, and Xu and Zhao Bingjun were appointed as officials in charge, and personnel from various departments were transferred. The matter was newly created, and many nobles and high-ranking officials were not restrained, and difficult problems emerged one after another. Xu was transferred as a minor official, and he solved the problem properly with his ingenuity. He was thus known and praised, and in a few years, he rose to the third rank. After serving as the chief of the legal department for a period of time in the early years of the Republic of China, his career became multi-faceted, such as the Fujian Governor (that is, the governor of the province at that time), the Minister of Transportation (during the Li President Duan cabinet), the Prime Minister of the State Council (during the old Duan's administration), and the Ambassador to Japan before the July 7th Incident (I heard that the old Duan was recommended, and when he was first appointed, Duan was still alive), which was also an important diplomatic task. It can be said that he was a "multi-talented" "Jun Ren". My cousin Suichu likes to talk about physiognomy, and once said that Xu's whole body is five short (the body and limbs are short), and the position of the five senses on the face is strict and the energy is concentrated. It is said that the "golden shape" is a precious emblem. I am not very familiar with this way, but because his words are quite interesting, I will attach them here.</p>
