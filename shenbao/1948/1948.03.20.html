<h3>民航大隊機被襲事件　我致蘇節略內容　認此舉動係不友好行為</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十九日電〕關於陳納德民航大隊飛機一架在渤海上空被蘇聯紅星驅逐機追逐射擊事，我國已於十八日晚再度向蘇提出嚴重交涉，據外部發言人十九日宣稱：外交部於十八日送達蘇聯駐華大使館節略一件，對本年三月八日為機追逐並射擊中國飛機一專，重申中國政府於本年三月十日向蘇聯政府所提出之抗議，該節略首機：被蘇聯戰鬥機攻擊之中國交通部僱用之運輸機，「其機尾書有XT」字樣，此項標誌係國標登記之中國飛機標誌，此外，在該運輸機上並書有「民用空運大隊」之藍色及黃色中文隊徽，機身兩側書有CAT字樣，其爲中國飛機至易辨識，因此，外交都對蘇聯大使館「三月十三一日來略稱：此項運輸機係不明飛機等語，深表詫異」。該節略繼稱：「中國對於東北諸省（即一九四五年八月十四日中蘇條約所指稱東三省）包括旅順海軍根據地在內，享有充分主權，該中蘇條約於此亦有明文宣示，中國交通部所僱用之運輸機，自有在此諸省之任何地區自由飛行及不受任何干涉之權」。何况「該項遝輸機在三見八日自瀋陽飛往青島之航綫，並未經過旅順海軍根據地區域，該運輸機開始遭受蘇機追逐及射擊之上空，係在旅順西南四十五哩之處，顯在旅順海軍根據備以外，該運輸機遭受一追逐之時間，達十二分鐘，被追逐至山東半島尖端附近之上空」。因之，蘇聯大使館來略所稱：「曾有不明飛機侵犯順旅海軍根據地區域邊界之聲明，非但與事實不符，且係藐視中國主權，而蘇機追逐中國運輸機，竟達至山東半島尖端附近之上空，顯屬侵犯中國領空權」。節略續稱：在東北諸省之軍事現狀下，上述蘇軍當局之阻撓行爲，我尤不能不視爲不友好之行爲。最後，該節略鄭重聲明：「中國飛機在中國事有主權之一切地區內飛行，有不受任何阻碍之權，並請蘇聯政府嚴禁旅順蘇軍當局再有類似以上所述之阻撓行爲」</p>

<p>社論</p>
<h3>論整肅政風</h3>
<p>政治是管理衆人之事的，如果政治不淸明，衆人之事便管理不好，整個國家社會就不免因之發生動亂。所以我們要戰亂圖治，行憲建國，必須首先肅淸貪汚，革新政治，並　設廉能政府，以整肅政風。</p>
<p>報載廣西省政府卅七年度民政的首要工作，在於「嚴肅政風」，其工作計劃要點如下：（一）登記公務人員財產。（二）重刑懲辦貪汚及不法者。（三）做古代動亂時期加强刺史權限史例，提高專員監督權力。（四）改善吿密制度，厚獎人民及部屬舉發貪污。（五）裁汰冗員，改善公務人員生活。（六）建立特種獎勵制度，厚獎勤康富創造性之人員。（七）厲行節約，改善社會風氣。</p>
<p>這個「嚴肅政風」的計劃，各方一致擁護，並提出具體意見。例如廣西省參議會，議長蔣繼伊氏主張：「澈底執行縣長獎懲辦法，決不徇情」。省參議員廖百芳氏並提出「做縣長須找保證人」的議案，也獲得熱烈通過。廣西省民政廳長張威遐氏則主張：「大事生產，從開發自然界求出路。其治標辦法爲（一）愼用賢能，（二）心理改革。」他如中委李任仁氏主張「厚祿養廉」，桂林市長蘇新民氏則主張「非自上而下不可」，好像廣西省對整肅政風正在要轟轟烈烈的幹去，不可謂非空谷之足音。</p>
<p>誠然，整肅政風「應自上而下」，應「厚祿養廉」，應任用賢能，應依法獎懲縣長，應澈底裁汰冗員，厚獎廉能官吏，嚴懲貪汚及不法者，尤應健全監察制度，旣要拍蒼蠅，更要打老虎，務使全國的蒼蠅老虎一網打盡，以肅淸貪污的種子，養成廉能的政風。然而「爲政不在多言，顧力行何如耳」，也是一句古人的名言，我們深願看到政風有一天眞正的整肅。</p>
<p>「儉以養廉」「動能補拙」的兩句格言，是培養廉能政風的原動力。古今中外，決沒有奢侈縱欲而能廉潔的官吏，也決沒有懶惰成性而能勤政愛民的官吏。所以我們要建設廉能的政府，必須先培養一般官吏儉樸動勞的政風。儉樸與勤勞，是有連帶關係的。一個儉樸的人，也往往是一個勤勞的人。在這抗戰內亂十年，元氣大傷的國家社會裏，勤儉風氣的培養，實在是客觀環境所最需要的。但維持勤儉的風氣，必須以免除飢寒的威脅作爲條件。以今日一般公務人員的生活而言，十之七八够不上溫飽，尤其是縣級以下的公務員，更是飢寒交迫，不能維持生活。當局如再不設法改善其待遇，不但行政效率低落，而且貪汚勢將形成一種「心照不宣」的習氣。所以我們眞要澄清史治，整肅政風，全國各級政府，自中央官吏以迄最基層的公務人員，均須切實參照生活指數發薪，並擴大配給制度，建築公務人員的住宅，務使全國公務員的衣食住行等問題，都獲得相當合理的解決，而無凍餒之虞，必如此，使他們不再憂慮食不飽，衣不暖，而後可用嚴刑峻法來處罰他們的貪污罪行。</p>
<p>當這開始行憲的年代，初上民權第一課，自中央以至地方，由民意機關以至政府，均展開轟轟烈烈的競選，無論競選什麼，競選者均應有運動員的精神。換句話說，競選者應該公平競爭，並應有守法的精神，容忍的風度，禮　的襟度，以及合作的習慣。一個賢明的政治家，在競選的時候，更要有如賽球時的運動員的精神，「他才能成爲一個够格的民主政治家」，也惟有這樣，才能培養優良民主的政策，走上民主　政的光明大道。同時，全國的選民，必須慎重的處理他自己神聖的一票：把這一票投給確能爲人民謀福利，為國家社會忠實服務的人，決不投給爭權奪利和營私舞弊的人；把這一票投給公忠體國，信義卓著，衆望所歸的公正人士，決不投給作好犯科，背信無義，怨聲載道的地方惡霸；把這一票投給學問有專長，德業有專攻的學者專家或事業家。決不投給不學無術，德薄能鮮的官僚政客與土豪地病等。在另一方面，各機關首長以及地方長官，必須選賢任能以佐治，才能奮發有爲，勵精圖治。所以由下而上的選賢與能，和由上而下的選賢任能，是行憲建國應有的民主改風。</p>
<p>此外，各級政府，任何官吏，均應有「公」與「忠」的兩種政風。怎樣才能公呢？政府能把經濟，行政，用人等等都公開，就能大公無私。大凡民主國家的政府都有對國民公佈財政預算和決算的義務，不但財政數字應該公開發表，其他數字亦應儘量發表，不但數字應該發表，而且一切經濟措施都應使國民容易明白了解而不應帶有隱瞞或欺騙國民的成分。在任何行政措施決定以前，總應公開宣布，甚至擴大宣傳，使國民了解與實的情形。政府官吏的進退升降，尤應大公無私，選賢與能，定時考績，公開黜陟。這樣才能建設廉能政府，實行民主憲政。怎樣才能忠呢？「忠」字的意義就是「負責」。政府和官吏，要怎樣負責呢？第一，要對國家負責，也就是忠於國。當這國家走上行憲建國的偉大年代，全國官吏與各級政府，必須赤誠為國，國富圖强。因爲官吏是政府的員司，政府則是代表國家行使迨療的機關，行憲建國的一切國策，都由中央政府直接施行或命令地方政府行之。所以國家的一切法令，尤其是國家的根本大法，自中央救府以充於省，專署，縣，區，鄕鎭，保，甲，做公務員的，都應一一忠實執行，負責去做，以實現憲法之治，完成民主國家的規模。第二，要對人民負責，也就是忠於民。宜吏是人民的公僕，政府是爲人民謀福利的機關，當然要爲人民忠實服務。在這大動亂的國家社會裏，人民負担極重，痛苦極深。所以政府和官吏，當隨時訪間民間疾苦，並竭力設法以解除之，人民有什麼正當要求，更當努力促其實現，以增巡人民的福利。第三，要對工作負責，也就是忠於職。政府和官吏，都有他應做的工作或職務。在此行憲建國的大時代，各級政府與全國官吏，其工作或職務，都較平時繁重，自然更要負起責任，堅守崗位，振奮精神二埋頭苦幹。尤應盡忠職守，在職一日，則集中精力，辦一日之事，並要視工作的性質，分別先後緩急，計劃進行，循序舉辦。政府和官吏，如能忠於國，則碳憲行，忠於民，則民困蘇，忠於職，則國家治。「公」與「忠」二者，實在是亟應培養的兩種基本政風，也是整飭政風必須提倡推進的基本精神。</p>
<p>明神宗信任了一位張居正面當時萎麾泄沓的政風爲之一變，淸成同　靠了一位曾國藩而挽回了貪婪腐敗的滿洲王朝的厄運。我們目前卑之無甚高論，何處有張居正？何時有會國藩？我們在這戡亂圖治。行憲建國的大時代，旣有領導我們抗戰勝利的國家元首，我們祗指望輔弼元首的大人先生們，學學先賢的榜樣，公忠體國，拿出嶄新的精神，領導多數純良的公務人員，造成一種耳目一新的政治風氣。撥亂反正，這是唯一的樞紐了！</p>

<h3>緬甸華僑社會（上）</h3>
<p>— 本報記者　袁文中</p>
<p>〔本報仰光十四日航訊〕緬甸境內的華僑人數，據佔計約在三十萬人左右，其籍貫以福建雲南廣東三省爲最多，經營的事業則以木材·米糧·酒店·當舖·土產·雜貨等最爲主要。他們與印度人並駕齊驅的掌握着緬甸中下屬的經濟勢力。</p>
<p>華僑社團</p>
<p>記者團第一天到仰光，在機塲下機時，除有大使館與領事館派人來照料外，看不到一個僑胞的影踪。後來，在仰光十天期內除有兩次被邀參加華僑團體歡迎涂允檀大使的酒會及茶會外，與僑胞的接觸也多是限於個人方面，但事實上有華僑五萬人的仰光市內，華僑社團爲數極多，根據緬甸華僑服務社編贈的仰光華僑社團商號目錄上統計，工商業團體文化團體同鄕會及其他機關社團等共有七八十個之多，不過他們在活動上各自爲政，雖然相互之間還沒有重大的摩擦，却並無團結的力量。</p>
<p>黨政活動</p>
<p>我們在仰光首先感覺到的是中共與民盟份子在華僑社會中的活動相當活躍。仰光市內有四家華僑日報，內容都很貧乏，登載的新聞很多是隔了幾日的舊聞，副刊及其他消息則大都抄自國內報紙。最大的一家是中國日報，自稱爲大公報的尾巴，銷數算是最好的了，每天約有一千多份。次之是新仰光報，這家報紙的董事長是一個動搖的國民黨員，其報紙成爲民主同盟的宣傳工具，天天散佈着破壞政府威信的言論與消息，銷數約有數百份。再　之是國民黨總支部主辦的國民日報，在內容上頗不能使人滿意，銷數僅佔第三位。最後是共產黨的人民，報銷數雖僅幾十份，但每天製造謠言，攻擊中樞，以搖撼華僑對於政府的信仰。文書店方面，仰光市內共有正文書局，華書局，及南僑文化供應社等三家，規模都很小，經售的書籍種類也極少，其中南僑文化供應社又是共黨與民盟活動的據點。除去報紙與書店以外，在華僑學校由最近也有民盟與共黨滲人。最近共產國際在印度召開東南亞靑年火會，從香港方而有所謂中國代表前往參加，經過仰光時報上大吹大擂，並有許多團體開會歡迎。大使館與領事館方面雖然接到有關這種活動的報吿，但因國外環境不同，緬面政府是號柯左傾的政府，一般華僑對於政治又缺乏認識，所以一時間還沒有想出有效的對付辦法。</p>
<p>教育概況</p>
<p>說起緬甸的華僑學校，爲數倒是不少。仰光市內有二三十所中小學，其他各地的小學多達一百七十餘所。其中有幾所學校校舍寬敞，敎學用國語，程度很够得上水準，但大多數學校則用各地的方言敎授，具有駴種共同的困難與缺點：第一是經費枯竭，因爲政府對華僑敎育可以說毫無協助，各級學校的經費完全靠當地華僑來維持，而華僑一般的經濟能力在戰後普遍降落，因此各校經費大受影響。第二是敎材缺乏，國定木的敎科很書少遝到，偶而從國內寄來一些則不够分配。第三是師資恐慌，好敎員不容易請到。幾家規模較大的學校，每一個敎員差不多要担任兩人以上的鐘點課程，其餘大部份學校的敎員則不免濫竽充數，中學則畢業就做中學敎口小學剛畢業就做小學敎員的甚爲普遍。</p>
<p>政策問題</p>
<p>緬甸獨立以後，國家經濟主義思想甚爲濃厚，在這種政策之下，華僑所受的影響大致有三種：一是較大的企業政府要收回國營，一是出入口全由政府統制，華僑商業活動大爲困難，三是不動產法案的頒佈，規定外僑有土地五十畝以上者其超過之數祗能賣給緬甸人。雖然如此，這幾種影響並無我們想像中的那麼嚴重，大部份華僑對於他們的財產似乎並無多大憂慮，譬如說企業收歸國營吧，他們認爲祇要政府付出收購的代價，那也就無所謂；又譬如土地財產限制吧，他們認爲祇要能够出售換得金錢，不也還是一樣嗎？</p>
<p>事實上緬甸政府這種政策並不是單獨對華僑有特殊的歧視，他們的這種設施絕無非是想保障緬甸人自已的地位而已，因此關於我國歸僑復員的問題，緬甸政府一直藉口房屋與工作難覓而拖延。截止目前，歸僑已經重來緬甸復員的約有六千入而滯留閩粵的尙有七千人。最近經我當局一再交涉，緬政府派人至我國視察後已答應在本年內准二千人來緬，其中一千人即可辦手續，另一千人尙待審查。</p>
<h3>平市破獲共匪製毒機關　毒窟三處分設城東西北　築有精巧密室搜出大量毒品</h3>
<p>〔中央社北平十九日電〕平警備部稽查處日前以敏速行動，破獲共匪大規模製　機關，搜出毒品及製毒機器甚多，並捕獲有關人犯賀喜彩等十人。稽查處於該案整理吿一段落後，十八日邀此間中外記者參觀普設在平市東西北城之匪製毒機關三處。</p>
<p>東城毒窟設於東四六條南松橋八號，即賀喜彩之住宅，賀現年五十一歲，河北寗晋人，其子鴻基（又名明亮年廿八歲），父子二人素無正業，於敵僞時期即以販賣毒品，開設私銀號爲業，勝利後且變本加厲，勾結共匪連絡呂玉貞，採買員張瑞林，及其黨羽栗同德，韓富瑞，王學信，安自成，郭鴻生等，大量製造烈性毒品，呂玉貞等陸續自共匪晋冀察邊區禁烟局運來大批烟土，交由賀喜彩父子邀集羽黨，在住宅內築設暗牆夾壁，開廠製造毒品，藏於有靈便精密機關之桌椅內，並搜購巨量巴比通，咖啡精，醋酸等各種製毒原料，由葛永泰，邊鳴九，孟奐開等分別担任製造及採購工作，張定仁，徐雲山，王增福，陳國良，杜春和等担任遝銷，總計自勝利以來，歷時兩年有餘，其所製白面海洛英等毒品，數量之鉅，實無從計算，至其運銷地區，多係西安，太原，上海等處，航運往返一次，可獲利億萬，而受其毒害以致傾家蕩產，骨肉離散者，亦不可勝數。賀之住宅西屋內，有夾牆一堵，暗裝輕便啓閉機關，將牆壁啓開，即出現暗室三間，室內陳設有三抽屜書桌及精美之沙發，均係夾層中空，而暗室中之後牆，亦係活動，可以啓轉，牆後有一涵道，可通至地窖，藏納器具藥品甚多。</p>
<p>西城毒窟豐盛胡同廿號邊鳴九家，藏有製毒機器藥品及包裝毒品，印有「松竹梅」商標字樣之透明紙，及各項太戳多件，當記者前往巡視時，因中電三廠拍片，於房上又發現大批製毒藥品器具煙槍，爲本案之新收穫。</p>
<p>北城毒窟設香餌胡同廿二號張守仁家中，曾搜得裝於大汽油桶內之克羅方（烈性麻藥）一滿桶，及原裝麻里道六大盒（約計卅餘小盒，每盒約値六百餘萬元），醋酸二大瓶，咖啡精卅餘磅，均屬製毒原料。</p>
<p>以上賀喜彩·賀鴻基·張守仁。王增福。陳佐鄉·澳鳴九·孟興開·葛永泰·杜春和·徐樹滿等十人均就捕，惟共匪呂玉貞。張瑞林已將售出毒品所得巨款，購成軍用必需物品，携赴匪區換購烟土，致未獲案。其運來雅片烟土之方法，則係由未就捕之共匪栗同德前赴匪區採購，繞道天津，將烟土暗藏於硫化碱袋內，運至平市，於此可見共匪製毒機關組織之龐大。</p>
<p>至其陰謀之險惡，據稽察處倪處長超凱對記者稱：匪陰謀自我方取得軍需物資，處心積慮，不惜以種種卑鄙手段，俾達到其目的，此次所破獲之匪製毒機關，即其一例，匪以其所製毒品分運上海·西安·太原，換取黃金，再易爲法幣，購買電話機·汽軍零件·及其他軍用物資，無異自我方吸血，願該案之破獲能提高各地治安當局之警覺，對匪時加密切注意。並謂：據查年來發現甚多阪毒案件，可能均與本案有關。</p>

<h3>馬卿強調歐亞局勢嚴重性　決與強暴展開鬬爭　對蘇協調門戶仍保持開放</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕紐約十九日廣播：加里福尼亞訊，馬歇爾國務卿今日向加里編尼亞大學生了表演說，其要點如下：（一）警吿義大利及歐洲其他自由國家一點，即芬其爲共產黨所控制，則美國之援助自動停止；（二）目下世界之鬥爭，爲自由與暴政之鬥爭，　迫與武力之統治決不準其再事擴展；（三）美國維持「門戶開放」政策，仍願與蘇聯以協調方法解決各項問題；（四）從速實施歐洲復興計劃，以增强西歌各國之自衛力量。</p>
<p>〔路透社加州巴克萊十九日電〕馬歇爾國務卿十九日在此間接受加州大學名譽法學學位，即席發表演說，論及歐洲局勢時，謂「歷史上從未有較目前之局勢，更爲威脅吾人之主義及利益者」。他又說，中東·印尼·中國·中美·及拉丁美洲亦均有危急局勢存在。渠認美國亟需就世界的自由與專舉之普遍鬥爭，成立肯完決議。馬卿又對義大利提出警吿，聲明共黨如果在產大利之普選中獲得勝利，義大利自美國所獲之經濟援助將被切斷。但馬卿同時亦表示願與蘇聯成立協議，果爾，即可立即永遠結束目前之危險局勢。馬卿强調指出，美國決不呆以消極的不行動，逃避當前問題，亦不可分散其努力，使其實力不能發生效能。問題中心乃為美國應在何處及如何運用其勢力。所不達者，危急的局勢不僅存在於歐洲，亦有在於中國及中東，美國同時亦不可忽略拉丁美洲及其在日本朝鮮之直接責任，馬卿概述美國的地位如下：「我宗旨及政策在堅持基本原則，同時保持門戶的開放，以取得任何一般性的妥協行動，吾人誠懇地極願覓取成立協議的完善基礎，以永遠結束目前的局勢。吾人將繼續盡力獲致協議，然在得以成立真正解決以前，吾人之政策將爲反對及制止任何再事侵犯自由人民權利及生命的企圖。制止此項繼續性危機的即時有效辦法，在迅速而立即施行歐洲復興方案。美國以前從未面臨如此嚴重的局勢，而歐洲復興方案乃我一切未來決議的基礎」。</p>
<p>〔路透社華盛頓十八日電〕馬歇爾國務卿今日自華盛頓出發赴全國各地演說，促起國人認識征兵制度及普選訓之需要。十九日晨將在貝克萊之加里福尼亞大學演說，星期六下午在洛杉碸之加里福尼並大學演說。渠係乘總統專機「盟牛號」出發，定星期日返華府。</p>
<h3>克林姆宮反響如何　全世界密切注視</h3>
<p>〔路透社倫敦十八日電〕此間外交界人士預料西方國家或美國，再取過止共產勢力膨脹之新步驟以前，將有短期之停頓，以鞏固昨在華盛頓及布魯塞爾發動之行動，並觀察莫斯科方面之反響。觀察家對於莫斯科之是否將因西方之團結及杜魯門之保證支持此一國結，而調整共產情報局本期之計劃，意見不一。然繼續支持義共爭取四月十八日普選中之勝利，則必將繼續爲莫斯科基本政策之一。</p>
<p>西方國家所將採取下一步驟，一泰半將隨莫斯科之步驟而決定。莫斯科苟無新的外交攻勢，則在蘇聯控制區以外，一時當不致有任何驚人發展。西方國家今後即時性的任務，當爲福固其業已宣布的計劃，故在西歐聯盟業已取得穩固的立足點以前，此一國際新系統料不致遽即擴大。但若蘇聯政府即時發動反攻，則自又當別論。職是之故，外交界人士目前最爲注意者，爲克林姆宮方面　將產生的任何反響。</p>
<h3>西歐五國聯盟將迅速實現</h3>
<p>蒙帥將赴比視察防務</p>
<p>〔路透社白魯塞爾十八日電〕五國聯盟公約簽字僅廿四小時，比政府已向國會提出法案，請求國會批准該一公約。料英法荷盧其他四國亦均將採取迅速步驟，以批准聯盟公約。同時五國外長已決定於下週在比京召開條約中規定之永久咨詢委員會，以討論與職權，此爲使五國公約迅速實行之步驟。最緊急之任務當爲防　及經濟方面之企圖，英帝國參　總長蒙帥應比政府邀不久來比視察比軍事設備時，必可順便與五國關係方面討論聯防事務。</p>
<p>〔路透社渥太華十八日電〕加拿大官方人士稱，白魯塞爾五國公約擴大以容納他國時，加拿太顧意參加。該官方並曰，聯合國憲草內所述之區域公約，區域二字具有彈性，不以西歐爲限，如能包括各民主國，加拿大當樂於參加。</p>
<h3>北歐三國團結反共</h3>
<p>〔路透社瑞典京城十八電〕社會民主黨在此舉行大會，瑞典總理艾朗特，丹麥總理海托夫特。挪威總理蓋爾哈森等均蒞會發表演說。艾朗特表示，以民主方式反共，乃瑞典維護自由及獨立計劃之一部。斯坎的那維亞的安定與强盛，爲和平的因素，斯坎的那維亞國家之國結，並非針對任何人，他人母庸以爲將受威脅。艾氏並曰，捷克事件已揭破共黨的假面具，瑞典將參加保衛自由及和平的工作，但不願預先放棄促成全世界民族協議的希望。挪威總理蓋爾哈森聲稱，斯坎的那維亞境內共黨實力雖不堅强，但亦不可低估其威脅。預料斯坎的那維亞境內之共黨，將盡其所能破壞經濟，以爲阻撓馬做爾方案計劃之一部。蓋氏並曰，斯坎的那維亞國家對於世界和平最大的貢獻，乃爲協助歐洲復興。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社斯德哥爾摩十八日電〕國際發展尤其爲關於芬蘭者，實際雖未變動瑞典之外交政策，但消息靈通方面相信，瑞典政府將取某種步驟，以鞏固其國防，如此舉所需之特別經費難以籌措，則恐社民黨政府不願獨負此重大責任，而將糾織除共黨外之聯合政府。</p>
<h3>德共黨成立人民委員會</h3>

<p>〔路透社漢諾威十八日電〕下薩克宋尼邦英國專員洛格亨，今日吿記者稱，由於國際局勢之演變，西德佔領區全境或將於今年舉行普選。</p>
<h3>法軍費龐大</h3>
<p>〔路透社巴黎十八日電〕國民議會國防委負會頃議決，四月及五月份內法國軍費計五百五十億法郎，表決時共黨委員提反對票，該案即將提交國民議會辯論。</p>

<p>〔路透社羅馬十八日電〕右翼「羅馬晚報」載稱，義共黨已自莫斯科獲悉，蘇聯將於義普選前之數日宣布放棄對義和約規定應分配給蘇聯之義大利軍艦，藉以提高義人對蘇好感，使其擁獲共黨控制之人民陣綫。蘇聯應獲得之義艦包括主力艦巡洋艦各一，　留艇二艘，及其他各式艦艇。</p>
<h3>紅軍復員說　美不予重視</h3>
<p>〔路透社華盛噸十八日電〕國務部不信草斯科電台所稱蘇聯陸軍之復員，具有重要意義。國務部發言人麥克台莫稱，美政府所獲報吿，乃爲蘇陸軍雖有一級復員，但同時有另一級奉召入伍。</p>
<h3>法義採防共措施　法當局驅逐蘇僑民出境　義破獲共產黨私藏軍火</h3>

<p>〔路透社巴黎十八日電〕前「蘇聯公民聯合會」會長奧狄奈資之寓所昨夜被搜查，結果共逮捕十二人，連奧氏在內。據內政部公報稱，法政府發現去歲十二月十五日經當局下令解散之「蘇聯公民會」業已秘密恢復，其指導委會並定期在各不同處所舉行會議。在最近之集會時，遂將與會各人逮捕。經盤問後，並就抄獲之文件觀，確證各人有違抗法政府命令之行爲，遂決定立即予以驅逐。同時警局方面對於蘇匈波南保等國僑民亦均在調查中。</p>
<p>〔合衆社羅馬十九日電〕義總理加斯貝利今日開始巡遊義共堡壘北部工業區，展開巨大之競選運動。演說譴責義國左派聽從外國命令行事。加氏因杜魯門總統保證援助民主國家而備覺壯阻。渠在波羅那演說，願以全力支特西歐聯盟，以拯救自由和平與文化。義總理指斥共產情報局在義北及法國設立秘密委會，以調度義北及法國之共黨謀略。渠稱，「不投票乃懦夫，投票是責任，投錯票是賣國」。加氏將在波羅那。米蘭及其他共黨控制區域演說反共。在大選緊張空氣益濃之際，警察出動搜查私藏軍械。在最近數次搜查中，共黨五十六人被控非法私藏軍火，某處藏有步槍二百支，手提機關槍十四架，軍火三萬發及無綫電收發機工具。</p>

<h3>世界新聞自由會議決定下週二揭幕　該會主張予記者更大工作自由</h3>
<p>〔路透社日內瓦十九日電〕世界新聞自由會議定本月廿三日在日內瓦揭幕，以討論實施十六個月前聯合全體大會所稱：「新聞自由，爲基本人權，亦為聯合國組織所基一切自由的試金石」一項宣言之方法。應邀與會者除聯合國全體會員，國外尙有阿爾巴尼亞，奧國，保加利亞，芬蘭，匈牙利，愛爾蘭，義大利，葡萄牙，羅馬尼亞，瑞士，外約但諸隔。國際新問記者組織，將在火會中取得特別地位，該組織將向大會提出具體建議，以予記者以更大的工作自由，改良記者之職業能力，及防止新聞事業之獨佔。</p>

<p>〔聯合社華盛頓十八日電〕國務部今日接得報吿，謂有蘇聯支援之「國際軍」三師，約三萬名，正駐紮巴爾幹，準備越界開入希臘。此項軍隊大部份爲希臘及阿爾巴尼亞人編成。據國務部官員稱，反希臘運動之加速進行雖證明係受蘇聯軍事指揮，但此項「國際軍」司令部中尙不能證明有蘇聯軍官參加。此種趨勢是否爲攻擊希臘即將發動，或仍屬共產黨神經戰之一部份，則尙不明。</p>
<h3>克勒門蒂斯被任捷外長</h3>
<p>安理會對捷案不致有行動</p>
<p>〔聯合社捷克京城十九日電〕布拉格電台今日廣播稱，捷克政府已任命克勒門蒂斯爲外交部長，以繼馬薩里克遺缺。克氏係斯洛伐克律師，現年四十六歲。</p>

<h3>四強討論奧和約　仍未獲協議</h3>
<p>〔路透社倫敦十八日電〕四强外長代表會討論蘇聯要求奧境德產之事，四强代表雖均提出讓步，但尙無協議成立。蘇代表柯克莫夫聲明蘇聯對東奧油產之要求，願意讓步百分之一，至總額之百分之六十六，而對於要求奧國賠付蘇聯之二億業美元現款，亦準備减少十七萬五千元。西方國家代表對於東歐油產問題之讓步，爲使蘇聯取得百分之五十至五十三之汕產。關於煉油廠事，西方國家同意蘇聯取得年產四十萬汕量之煉油廠，而蘇代表仍堅持至少應爲四十五萬噸。</p>
<h3>華萊士抨擊　杜魯門政策</h3>
<p>〔合衆社紐約十九日電〕第三黨總統候選人華萊士，今日針對杜魯門恢復徵兵之要求，而發表其答覆。渠稱，阻遏共產之方略業已擴展過度，致危及舉世人類之生命。又稱，美國毫無與蘇聯作戰之理由。渠指斥「假公濟私之徒」圖藉「共產主義」一字而「掩蔽眞理」，恢復徵兵及挑動第三次世界大戰。華氏稱，「潑婦駡街」，一事無成。「本人爲舉世和平而呼籲，中國及義大利之基本土地改革已過期多時。共產黨認識此事，而加以利用，彼等初不能有所創造也。美政府一筆抹殺歷史潮流所不能免之運動，而逕以「共產侵略」目之。本人不忍目覩數十億金元，尤其重要者，數百萬美國生命，因若干美國政客不願接受簡單之事實而鄭之於虛耗」。按杜魯門昨日宣佈情願失敗而不願接受華萊士「或其共產黨徒」之後援。華氏今日對此竟默爾不答。</p>
<h3>喀什米爾之爭　談判又擱淺</h3>
<p>我折衷案印巴意見分歧</p>
<p>〔聯合社成功湖十九日電〕印度與巴基斯坦對於喀什米爾之爭執，昨夜因巴基斯坦，不允接受中國所提折衷案而吿擱淺，現待聯合國安全理事會下星期二開會作最後決定。印度對於中國建議大體上已表示同意，僅須略加修正。中國提案內容如下：（一）印度在客什米爾設立臨時政府辦理公民投票，表決加入印度或巴基斯坦；（二）聯合國調解委員會監視投票以保公正；（三）巴基斯坦保證撤退侵入喀什米爾之土人及巴基斯坦國民；（四）印度對於確保當地治安以外之軍　，應全部加以撤退。</p>
<h3>遠委會否決蘇控訴麥帥</h3>

<h3>新所得稅法即公布施行　直接稅署署長談話　鼓勵掃除假賬運動</h3>
<p>財政部直接稅署署長王撫洲氏，因公來滬，十九日接見記者稱：新所得稅法業經立法院修正通過，日內即可公佈施行，新稅法係根據十年來徵收經驗，並儘量採納納稅人之意見草擬完成，故對舊稅法言，實爲一大進步。新稅法之特點爲手續簡單，稅率减低，及對象普遍。目的在使納稅人之負担减輕，同時國家之稅收亦可增加、蓋以納稅人獲得公平合理之負担，逃稅已無必要，國家稅收所受之損失即可避免。渠繼分析新稅法之內容，謂分類所得稅之對象包括下列五類：（一）營業收入，（二）薪支報酬，（三）利息收入，（四）財產租賃，（五）一時所得。除（二）至（五）項將由擬繳人負責擬繳，行商所得由行棧扣繳外，營業所得稅已決定取消，根據資本婁額計算之辦法造成「虛盈寬稅」之因素，乃吿去除。至於稅率雖仍累進至百分之三十，但以過份利得稅已予取消，故納稅人之負担，自較過去大爲减輕。王氏謂新稅法施行後，逃稅現象可趨减少，當有裨於國民道德之提高，但曰難保狡頑之徒縱續其違法之行爲，故今後對逃稅之處罰將較過去愈加嚴厲。渠認工商界此時亟宜發動「掃除假賬運動」，並盼興論界作有力之支援。蓋以製作假賬不特欺騙政府損害稅收，且亦欺騙股東减少彼等投資正當事業之興趣，對工商業之發展實爲一重大之障礙。</p>

<h3>英商電車工資問題　趙副局長發表談話</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕英商電車公司三百餘職員年終加薪問題，社會局昨日上下午分別召集勞資雙方調解，猶未解決。據趙副局長表示：「英商電車公司職工年終加薪，職員與工人本有差別，前年工人因職員自三十元底薪調整至四十元，曾罷工五天，經社會局調解協議職員工人一律平等，今後年終加薪一律以底薪作根據，不再有職員與工人之差別。此項規定，職員確似稍吃虧，但以前職員加薪必須各部門主管人員簽擬提名，未必每人均加，而今則不犯過失之職員均可普加。現職員要求恢復一九三八年之辦法，僅計其短而未計其長，工人對職員此舉並不同情，况六大公用事業年終加薪均一律以底薪作標雄。本人至今尚未想出可使資方折服之理由，如勞資雙方不能協議，則社會局將依法批示裁決」</p>

<h3>傳正模視導兩團管區歸來　各縣役政尚稱滿意　兵販活躍決予嚴懲</h3>
<p>上海師管區司令傅正模中將，視導吳縣團管區所轄之常熟。吳縣。吳江及松江團管區所轄之崑山。太倉等五縣，推行役政情形，於十七日上午九時偕征集科長周雨羣，軍醫主任葛建勳等，乘車自滬出發，中央社記者隨行視察，歷時三日，業於昨午四時返抵滬。傳氏歷經各縣，責地查問，對新兵征集所之設備，新兵之保育，及征兵之技術各方面深切注意，對各級負責役政人員隨時予以指示改正，各縣辦理役政情形　致回堪滿意，惟仍發現若干重大缺點，有待迅謀改善，此與役政及戡亂軍事之前途皆有莫大關係。</p>
<p>吳縣團管區本年度配額共八千餘名，其中常熟配額三千一百餘名，迄目前爲止，巳征集一千五百餘名，吳縣配額三千七百餘名，已征集三分之一，吳江配額一千四百餘名，已征集儿百餘名，松江團管區之崑山縣配額九百餘名，已征集四百七十餘名，太倉配額一千零數十名，已征集六百餘名。據各縣負責人談：本年四月底以前，均可全部征集完成。</p>
<p>新兵安家費用　最高白米卅擔</p>
<p>各縣新兵安家費之數字，視各縣各鄕之財力而異，一般堪稱優厚，最高額達白米三十担之數，折合現金約為一億元，最低亦有白米十五担左右，由於安家費（即白米）之大量募集，四鄉食米紛紛集城區，因而連日米價亦吿下跌。</p>
<p>記者隨傳氏視察之各縣，發現最堪注意之問題，爲負責推行役政之縣級人員，未能確實認眞辦理，兵役之宣傳亦嫌不足，地方民意機關，尤存數衍塞責心理，估計各縣已征集之新兵中，十分之七以上皆所謂「志願兵」，而「志願兵」之種流弊，因而亦在所難免。瑩整大者如：（一）兵販子大肆活躍，造成無兵販子，即幾無志願兵之現象。（二）現役軍人投效志願兵，使弄圈套，以達騙取鉅額安家費之目的後，即設法逃亡。（三）其純粹來自田間者，則多逾齡或體格不合格。（四）共匪爲破壞我役政，及進行反宣傳工作，有混入志願兵羣中之可能，唯尙無發現。</p>
<p>享受平等待遇　透露歡愉之色</p>
<p>傳司令對兵販子問題，業已向國防部提供建議，兵販子一經查獲，如其年齡體格適合於當兵者，即無條件令其抵充兵額，不發給安家費，並無限期延長其服役期間，以示懲戒，而儆效尤。如其年齡體格不適合於當兵者，則送法院嚴辦。傳氏並爲防免奸匪混入及新兵逃亡之現象，已令各級役政人員，對志願兵之來歷，有無國民身份證，或差假證符號等等，務須詳細查明。其將安家費隨身携帶者，須令登記，注意管理。傳氏曾數次召集新兵訓話，講述當兵之意義，當前之任務，同時誥誡各管理人員，對新兵須視同子弟發揮親愛精神。據記者所得觀感，新兵在縣征集所時尙不無恐懼心理，經新兵大隊接收以後，完全享受正式士兵之待遇，其心理即豁然</p>
<p>徵兵不乏佳話　只要鋼筆一枝</p>
<p>各縣新兵征集所之設備，以崑山較佳，常熟，太倉次之，吳縣與吳江最差。傅司令對此曾分別召集各縣縣長，參議會議長，黨部書記等商討改善，最低限度，須達到「吃得飽睡得暖」兩項標準。</p>
<p>征兵聲中，不乏佳話，值得大書者，如常熟新兵吳永生，不收安家費，只要一支鋼筆，吳江新兵王大勇所得安家米廿五石，以十石留爲老父百年後辦理喪葬之費，以十五石留爲兄第敎育之需，太倉縣保長沈康懷，黃俊元，首先征其胞弟沈金寳，黃武奎服役。蘇州吳江等縣城隍廟連日香火旺盛，乃爲入伍新兵與其家屬焚香禱吿，以祝出征平安，早日凱旋歸來。　又悉傳司令將於日內再赴松江團管區所轄之金山·松江·奉賢·各縣，繼續　道役政。</p>

<h3>裝甲勁旅在成長中</h3>
<p>〔本報徐州十六日訊〕本　平五日，記者團有一個難得的機會，參觀了蔣緯國領導下的戰車第一團。這一團是目前我國裝甲武力中最强大的一個單位，它的所屬戰車，正分散成若干小的單位，在華東各戰塲上活動。第一團的戰士很興奮的吿訴記者：三月份來參觀，他們是特別高興，因爲引起了光榮歷史的回憶。原來在卅三年三月三日，遠征軍戰車營自印緬邊境向瓦魯班日軍進擊，到三月八日，竟能一舉擊潰了以精銳聞名的日第十八師團。美國盟友從這時候起，始信國人够資格駕駛戰車，且能在戰塲上發揚它的成力。當時，戰車營趙副營長志華，現在就是第一團的副團長，以他豐富的經驗，翊助蔣團長緯國領導這支新的武力。</p>
<p>蔣緯國的印象</p>
<p>蔣緯國團長給我們的印象是：年靑，聰明，談吐和行動之間都充滿了活力。從他與部屬對話的神情上，可看出畏官屬僚之間，關係相當融洽。他很客氣的招待我們，說除開某某數部門之外，其餘均可聽任我們自由的參觀或攝影，但是有些情形因與國防有關，希望我們不發表。我們絡續地會見了各營連長，就由他們引導，參觀了裝甲車坦克車和修理廠等各個單位。現有的戰車，都是抗戰時期由印緬戰塲乘勝進人國門的，勝利後接收的日本戰車，由於他們自動的破壞，價値已等於廢鐵。我們使用的這些美國坦克，在世界標準上，只能算是輕型的，但在戡亂軍事中，已發揮很大的威力。有些裝甲汽車是由軍用大卡車改造過來的，在這些地方，說明國人頗有創造力。據工作人員說，他們的油彈並不感到缺乏，但是機器零件確很需要外來的接濟。這是馬歇爾國務卿來華使命失敗後，停止軍火援華的結果。我當時吿訴他們說：這種情形不致維持過久，因為美國自本年三月四日起，下令趕運軍火來華，而首批二千噸巳在途中。</p>
<p>戰車營的官長</p>
<p>這眞是一支美式配備的武力，從武器到服裝，都是如此。就是在工作人員的熟忱上，亦幣些美國氣息。技工穿着油汚滿身的工作衣，在裝甲車腹下爬出爬進，一些也不媽虎。他們的待遇亦相當不壞，比普通的陸軍待遇要高得多。團內一切佈置，井井有條，說明這是一個講求效率的團體。</p>
<p>戰車營內的好幾位官長，方自豫東前綫回來，他們轉戰魯豫，對於戡亂軍事有不少實際經濟。他們說戰車平日固定配屬於某幾個師，即由其師長指揮。非遇大敵或聞殲匪軍之時，不輕易使用。而每次出動，必有相當收獲。除開前年冬天魯南一挫之外，此外絕少這受損害。</p>
<p>匪軍武器不夠</p>
<p>匪軍目前尙無足量打擊戰車的武器，更找不出能運用戰車的技術人員。在某次戰役中，國軍有坦克一輛深陷於河岸汚泥之中，不得不加以拋棄，匪軍尋到以後，用幾條牛去拖，亦拖不動，最後就置之不顧而去。匪軍對於被俘的國軍特種部隊和作戰有名部隊的士兵，在痛恨之餘，常喜使用支解的酷刑，實是慘無人道。從去年秋天起，匪軍的俘虜政策頗有修正，常分批放回國軍被俘的官員與士兵，想利用這批人心理上之一時失常，來瓦解國軍的士氣和戰鬥意志。在被俘拘留的時期內，故意予以優待。可是對於飛行員和特種部隊的士兵，仍多殘殺。至於黨政人員，則述同其家屬都是被殘害的對象。</p>
<p>另有一位戰車部隊的述長，他目擊匪軍如何處理他自家的傷兵。他說：他們確是盡力使戰場上不留自己的傷兵，輕傷的發動大量的民夫抬走，而且加意救護，使其能早日重上戰塲。如果是重傷的話，他們沒有足够的醫藥設備，又不願使其部隊看見，常是秘密的集體活動。在地面的墓碑上，是用一個人的名字，底下却是個千人塚！</p>
<p>表示前途樂觀</p>
<p>蔣緯國和記者團有一小時以上的愉快談話，對於提出的許多問題，他都很得體的答覆和閃避了。他說：他平日公餘喜歡看些無綫電和機械方面的番籍，因爲無綫電通訊和裝甲部隊的關係太密切了。同時，在現在這個時代，要領導人家，全靠本人的學識技能，資格年齡是壓不住人的。對於中國裝甲部隊的前途，他認爲政府成立裝甲兵司令，表示有長期的計劃，所以很表樂觀。特別是徐庭瑤將軍之被任爲司令，更爲政府之英明處置。對於很多大的問題，他顯得難於答覆，最後明白表示「不要考他」，大家亦一笑了事。對於這樣有無比憑藉的靑年軍事家，能自願跑到徐州第一綫來苦幹，我們願意表示敬意。</p>
<p>參觀裝甲兵校</p>
<p>離開戰車第一團後，記者團特訪問養成裝甲部隊駕駛員的裝甲兵學校。在胡校長獻羣有條不紊的逐項說明之後，一個輪廓的概念是有了。値得提出的是訓練方法的科學化，充分的利用了圖表模型和敎育電影。每一個複雜的原理，都分解成很單純的動作。有正常智力的人，在短期內不難學會所有的課程。胡校長說：「這種辦法，美國人呌它「愚人亦會的方法」。不過，我們在受訓之前，先有一個「機械頭腦」的測驗，利用科學的儀器，算出每一個人學習的能力，如果智力太低，不在錄取之列。現在一切講求效率，所以我們的訓練方法，雖是使「愚人亦會」，但是眞正的愚人，我們可不要。」（本報記者丁維棟）</p>

<h3>今日之郵政</h3>
<p>— 李進祿</p>
<p>為紀念郵政成立五十二週年作</p>
<p>我國郵政事業，發端於郵傳之制，遠自有周，即置郵傳命，其後秦築馳道，郵路四達，漢唐以還，驛站大盛，元以武功强大，站赤制度，推廣至遠，以迄明淸，代有興革，至正式開辦國家郵政，自民國紀元前十六年創立以來，迄今亦已有五十二年之歷史。</p>
<p>古之郵驊，僅供富軍之用，限於傳遞官書，今則以服務公衆爲主旨，無論何人，無論何地，均有郵政爲之服務。復郵以還，國內擾攘未己，交通梗阻，在此種動盪不安之局勢下，郵政建設，自屬不易。幸賴郵政有苦幹之傳統精神，故雖困難重重，仍能羣策羣力，在交通主管當局之領導下，力求進步。</p>
<p>三十六年冬始，俞部長先後確定改進郵政服務之四大原則，並推行各項新設施爲其實現之方法，舉其大者，有如下列：</p>
<p>（一）迅速：儘量利用航空運輸郵件，設立火軍，輪船，汽車等行動郵局，擴展郵政汽車路綫，改良投遞方法，簡化處理郵件業務等項；</p>
<p>（二）普遍；增設各類郵務機構，增闢郵路，發展邊疆郵務，改進鄉村郵遞，設置示範郵局，通宵郵局，與例假郵局等項；</p>
<p>（三）安全：注意保護郵件，努力撲滅死信，創辦報値掛號郵件，擴展航空保價郵件等項；</p>
<p>（四）服務：設立公衆服務機構，以建立郵政與公衆之關係，俾能隨時明暸公衆對郵政之意見與要求，並接受批評與建議，而為郵政改進之指針。</p>
<p>此四大原則，其基本精神，即在尊重公衆意見，勇於自我檢討，以隨時改進業務。誠以此種精神之充分發揮，處處爲公衆着想，使郵政成爲公衆之事業，郵政自易臻美滿之境界，年餘以來，此種努力，尙具成續。</p>
<p>郵政今日所最感困難者，一爲交通阻滯，不能儘量發揮其功能，以求進展，一爲經濟上收支不能平衡。以當前物價之猛漲，郵資不能及時調整，郵政以有限之收入，應付無限制之開支，，殊有補苴無方之苦，乃裁减人手，加長工作時間，撙節一切開支，並努力開展業務，以期吾五十餘年來艱辛創造之郵政，仍得繼續改進，普遍發展，使公衆能充分享受郵政滿意之服務，幸各界人士進而敎之。</p>

<h3>紀念劉湛恩</h3>
<p>— 陸士雄</p>
<p>近代的高等敎育，以學位作里程牌，由學士而碩士而博士。雖然說來是學無止境，但得了博士後，在學位上已是登峯造極，無復可加了。</p>
<p>有學問的未必一定兼有氣節，甚且有了學問仍然利令智昏認賊作父的亦難保其必無，試看抗戰時期的羣奸中，並非沒有博士學位的人在，褚民誼。張素民輩，即爲其例。</p>
<p>劉湛恩先生生前，原是一位博士，迨以身殉國，更成爲流芳史乘的烈士，前者是在學識上表徵其峯巔，後者是於氣節上彰提其忠烈，以一位敎育家而兼此兩「士」，誠不愧爲「萬世師表」。</p>
<p>劉博士在日，常以軋士林（汽油）自喩其身份，蓋軋士林爲機械上原動的主力，工業上重要的成份，它更能予人光明，洗刷汚跡，但它却終於自身焚化或蒸發了。劉博士以此自喩，所以他的為國犧牲捨身成仁原爲貫澈夙有的志願。</p>
<p>曾記得日僞因痛恨劉博士的抗日言論，故溫逆宗堯向他危詞恫嚇說：「哼，當心些，請你還是避避風頭吧！」可是劉博士決不苟圖「明哲保身」而回風轉舵，並且再接再厲，甚至有一天他看到中學部某英文敎師因事缺席，劉博士便步入敎室即用英語抗日題材代了一次課。其愛國心的堅强熟烈，早把個人生命置諸度外。</p>
<p>滬江大學校方當局暨校友會方面，以本年四月七日爲劉故校長殉國十年祭期，對此一代完人不能不有所紀念，爰經發起三百億元募捐運動，將原有圖書館加以擴充，並定名爲「湛恩圖霄館」。聽說有兩位女校友從前結婚時都由劉博士證婚，現在已是寡婦，各捐數億元鉅款，一則紀念劉前校長，再則以紀念她們的丈夫。</p>
<p>總之，教育是為國儲才，倘然以才媚敵，還是無才爲德，所以得了博士再做漢奸，實有負國家造就人才之恩義。像劉博士的遺範，不是狹義的僅爲滬大師生作矜式，可廣義的推到整個民族作表率。</p>

<p>廠經　昨市高漲，各級五担貨俱無成交，Ｃ字等級下午喊價在三億三千五百萬元左右。高另担羅賓漢乾巽等，上午做開價三億二千萬元，下午討價抬高至三千萬元，干經高另担價在二億七千萬元左右。</p>
<p>綢货　昨市銳升，華強眞絲被面，開市一億一千一百七十萬元有成交，終因買興甚濃，行情步步高翔，最大價做一千八百萬元關外，收市即期做一千七百五十萬元。格子璧縐大誠單子收市做四十四萬元，其他眞絲貨廠盤均提高百分之十左右，人造絲貨俱告堅站。</p>
<h3>呢羢淡色占秀</h3>
<p>因時令氣節關係，淡色淺灰呢狨嗶嘰，步占秀色。買方需要，俱先欲淡色，致淡色呢料續見吃香，行情高出深色許多。同一身骨之貨品，單爲顏色上落，貴賤相差二三十萬元一碼，往往不足爲奇。其他呢羢各貨行情絕少特殊榮辱，實地成交亦稀，雖美匯又已調整至二十五萬五千元，人心無動於中，因拆息高昂，頭襯普遍軋緊，實銷削弱，兼人造棉日貨呢狨已有大量派配，買方均不敢借高利貨進貨。然章華花呢一碼掉換白米一擔之原則，今已超過，亦一主要因素，俱有居高思危之象。</p>
<h3>全經會通過化學原料　國內如能生產　全部禁止進口</h3>
<p>據參加全經會討論化學品限額會議之陳　聲氏談稱：化學品原料種類複雜，對於限額分配，極爲困難。過去輸管會分配該項限額，係根據民甘六年海關統計而定。至戰後化學品原料，有部份已能生產，勿須再轍入等情形發生，全經會爲此特於十七日在京召集全國工協會。輸管會·中央標準局·中央試驗听·經濟部等單位，開會研討，並根據工協會工補處所提之意見，通過下列三原則：</p>
<p>（一）國內已能生產而足敷應用之原料及產品，絕對全部禁止轍入</p>
<p>（二）國內不能生產而實際上確有需要之原料及產品，按實需情形，放寬轍入限額。</p>
<p>（三）國內生產不足之化學原料及產品，決斟酌情形限制輸入。該會爲愼重研討起見，特訂星期三再召集有關各單位在京繼續開會，作最後之決定云。</p>
<h3>店胃需求見活　米價繼續上升　食油漲勢尤露鋒铓</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕米市昨因百物上漲，產價報高，客方心理頗堅，店胃需求略活，南市各檔上升十餘萬元，北市初開上升二十萬，收市又漲五萬。</p>

<h3>中信局收購桐油　桐油業提供意見</h3>
<p>植物油轍出業同業公會，爲擁護中信局於本月十五日起恢復收購桐油，推廣出口政策，於十九日中午集議，提供意見，以備該局採納。茲集納如次：一，現時接近走私區域之梧州廣州桐油市價，爲每市担五七七萬（穗）六二〇萬（梧）元，與滬市彷彿，滬價似無提高之必要。二，爲穩定內地油價，在此外匯剛提，市況混亂之際，最好能靜持觀望，少做交易，以不波動市塲爲原則。此時若提高收購價格，最易惹起產地桐價之波動，增加內地收購困難。三，目前內地桐價與當貴米價比較，尚稱合理，故亦暫無變動之必要。四，收購價格如隨外匯調整而提增，則鼓勵出口不足，刺激桐價有餘，營運勢將永難納入正軌，故以酌情衡勢，暫不提高爲宜。</p>

<h3>甲骨卜辭中的〔〕字</h3>
<p>— 周祖謨</p>
<p>說文云：「虫，一名蝮，博三寸，首大如　指」。唐韻音許偉反。又云：「它，虫也。從虫而長，象冤曲　尾形。上古卵居患它，故相問無它乎」。唐讀音託何反。這兩個字的間讀不同。然而甲骨卜辭中「虫」與「它」就是一個字，象蛇虫之形，「無齿」字可以從「它」，亦可從「虫」，一無　」也可以作「無虫」，即是明證。然則虫即音它是無可疑的。說文又有　字，云：「蟲之總名也。讀若昆」。唐韻音古魂反。在卜辭中也有　字，我所見到的有下列八處：</p>
<p>這八片卜辭中「　」字的寫法雖小有異同，而由詞上的比較可以知道就是一個字，相當於說文的「　」字。第一片至第七片是屬於祭祀的卜辭，「　」字當是人名。第八片是屬於貞問　害的卜辭，「　」字似爲地名。前三片爲同時所卜，四·五·兩片爲同時所卜，書法的時代都很早，約爲武丁時卜人所書。據董彥堂先生殷膳譜所說　祭字如此作也正是早期的寫法（見上編卷三，第十三頁。）惟有這裏所祭享的人，各爲「　」的，不類殷之先公先王，因爲我們所見到的材料中他不曾與別　先公先王等在一起合祭，所以我以爲或即尚書仲虺之誰的「仲虺」。書仲虺之誥序云：「湯歸自夏，至於大坰，仲虺作誥」。仲虺之誥人人都知道是偽書，而仲虺當確有其人。在春秋左氏傳宣公十二年襄公十四年都曾稱引仲虺的言辭，而且定公元年傳云：</p>
<p>薛宰曰：薛之皇祖奚仲居薛，以爲夏車正，奚仲遷于邳；仲虺居薛，以爲湯左相。</p>
<p>這更是最可信的記載。然則仲虺生於商代，乃薛之祖先，當無可疑。所以尚書僞孔傳說：「仲虺爲場佐相，奚仲之後」，即本於春秋左氏傳。仲虺旣確有其人，是當商湯的時候有兩個重臣，一爲伊尹，一爲仲虺。伊尹之名，卜辭中已屢見，且時常與大乙合祭，（見後編上廿二葉第一片及幸編一五一片）則仲虺不能不見於卜辭。現在從以上所舉的幾片甲骨來看，似乎「蚰」就是「仲虺」了。</p>
<p>但是要建立這一種說法，首先要解決兩個疑問。第一，伊尹有與大乙合祭的卜辭，而仲虺沒有，似乎可疑。第二，虺字尚書釋文音許鬼反，韻書亦然。　字則說文與韻書音昆，古魂反，二者不合，應當尋求一個解釋。</p>
<p>關於于第一個問題，要有滿意的解答很難，必須有新材料的發現始可。前面的材料雖不足語此，然而旣可以燎柴祭之，享以羊豕，則非先公先王及國之車臣莫屬。令　固不與先公先王同列，反而可以見出是國之重臣了。</p>
<p>關於第二個問題，似爲　　所在，然亦不難解釋。我們可以分爲兩點來討論：</p>
<p>（一）虺字的讀音，</p>
<p>（二）蚰與虺在聲音意義上的關係。</p>
<p>（一）虺字說文云從虫元聲。此字釋文旣若許鬼反，則從元聲不合。所以徐鉉云：「元非聲，未詳一。考淸人吳　雲小學說虺略云：</p>
<p>尚書「仲虺」，史記股本紀作「仲　」，石經作「仲傀」，荀子堯問篇作「中簾」。說文：傀，偉也，爾雅：紅龍古，其大者頭。傀與歸皆有長大之義，虺旣與傀　通用，則虺亦有長大之義；故從兀，兀，高貌也。虫，聲也。然則　是龍古之大者，傀是人體之大者，虺是蝮蛇之大者，音義並同得通。</p>
<p>吳氏此說最得音義相關之理。玉篇已謂虫爲古文虺字則稱虺從虫聲，殊有見地。今由吳氏所舉尚書仲虺字的異文來看，雷傀薛都是古韻脂部字，則虺也應當屬於脂部，而且國語吳語云：「爲虺弗摧，爲蛇將若何」？此虺摧協韻，蛇何協韻，摧亦脂部字，是虺摧同部，尤有確證。又顏氏家訓中曾舉出一個「螝」字來，也與虺字相通。家訓勉學篇云：</p>
<p>吾初讀莊子曰：「螝二首」，韓非子曰：「蟲有螋者，一身兩口，爭食相龁，遂相殺也」。茫然不識此字何昔，逢人輒問，了無知者。後見古今字詁，此亦古之虺字，積年凝滯，豁然霧解。</p>
<p>據此則張揖古今字詁虺螝復爲一字。魄從鬼聲，亦屬脂部，如是更可以斷定虺字在古代必是脂部的續音了。</p>
<p>（二）虺字古音屬於脂部旣然知道了，則相傳讀爲許鬼一昔，自然不錯。但是「　」字說文音「昆」，唐韻作「古魂反」，「古魂」與「許鬼」不同，仍是疑問。案昆字古韻屬諄部，脂諄兩部常有對轉的關係。昆虺二字當爲對轉。因爲在聲紐上昆是見母字，虺之古音亦屬見母。前所舉虺字之異文傀廣韻音公回切，螝音居追切，旣都與昆爲雙聲，且詩何人斯「爲鬼爲蜮」，文選蕪城賦「增羅虺蜮」一語，鬼通作虺，是虺字古代當讀爲見母之證。在韻上來說，昆虺都是合口字。可以說聲韻部類除去韻尾以外，其餘都極爲相近。至於今昔虺爲許鬼反，屬曉母，似有可疑，若以「軍」聲作例，則渙然冰釋。軍字屬見母，而從軍得聲的字如揮　揮揮等都讀曉母，以此互證，則由見母變爲曉母，亦無足多怪。所以昆虺讀音上的不同必是對轉的關係。以理推之，讀脂部音宜在前，讀諄部音在後。若從字義上來講，虺蝮古人往往並舉，虺是蛇之大首者，而甲骨卜辭的蚰字正象大首之形，上列一·二·三·六·七各片所作最爲明顯，可以說甲骨文的「蚰」字與古人所用的「虺」字意議相符。再看說文的「　」字，旣云「讀若昆」，就是「岫」「昆」爲古今字，「昆」有衆意及盛義，而甲骨文的「　」字從兩虫以見其多，意思也正相應。</p>
<p>由以上的討論可以下一結論，即甲骨文的「　」字在形體上就是說文讀若昆的「蚰」字，在聲音上應當是讀作仲虺的「虺」字，「虺」古讀如「傀」若「螝」，「昆」與「虺」爲語之轉。如此則第二個問題也有了適當的解釋。</p>
<p>所以我就不妨大膽的假設卜辭中「燎如　」的「　」就是書之「仲虺」。不過假設終是假設，還希望有新的材料加以證明，不敢確乎自信。</p>

<h3>熙寧時代的編修中書條例所　熙寧新法述論之一</h3>
<p>— 鄧廣銘</p>
<p>王安石於宋仁宗嘉祐三年（西暦一〇五八）由江南東路提點刑獄入爲三司度支判官，奏進萬言書，極陳當世之務。總括其書中要點，計爲三項：</p>
<p>一是法度的問題。他以爲當時朝廷上所行的雖已法嚴令具，但大都不能合乎先王之政。要取法先王之政則必先法其意而對當時的弊法加以改易更革。</p>
<p>二是人才的培養問題。他以爲當時天下的人才實在太缺乏了。旣不能推行朝廷的法令，更不能期其變更天下之弊法以趨先王之意。因而在「教之·養之·取之·任之」諸方面，必須全盤改革使合於道才可。</p>
<p>三是財用問題。當時一般人都以爲官冗兵冗，遂致國家財用不足，因而大都從裁吏員减吏祿等方面着想；王安石却以爲當時財用之不足，只是因爲「有司不能度世之宜而抓其變」，「理財未得其道」之故，如果能「因天下之力以生天下之財，取天下之財以供天下之費」，便不會有財用不足之患了。</p>
<p>王安石上萬言書的年代，下距他制定各項新法強力推行的年代，中間整整隔了十年，然而這萬言書中所提出的主張，實際便是他後來變法的張本。</p>
<p>在萬言的末段有云：「然臣之所稱，流俗之所不講，而今之議者以爲迂闊而熟爛者也。…一有及此則羣聚而笑之，以爲迂闊。」這幾句話，表明了王安石對於一般人的流俗之見是在如何地鄙視。我們從此又可知道，不但王安石的主張前後完全一致，他對於流俗之見的不肯妥協的堅強態度（即後來他的反對黨所盡力宣傳的「流俗不足恤」），也是前後完全一致的。</p>
<p>王安石認爲先王之所力學而且力守的，是大倫大法，因而在前而所引述的萬言的三要點當中，修改法度一事也被王安石認作最首要最根本的事項。及至宋神宗熙寗初年王安石得君行道之日，最先設置的兩個與新法有關的機構，便是「制置三司條例司」和「看詳編修中書條例所」，前一個機構的任務是創立有關財政經濟的法條章則；後一個則是要從政事之本原着手，先要明確劃定中書省的權限和責任。</p>
<p>制置三司條例司的設置經過，從宋史等書中均可考明，而「看詳編修中書條例所」的設置用意設置經過，宋史語轔不詳，而又恰在續通鑑長編的闕卷當中，長編拾補中也未能補出其事。只有徐松所輯的宋會要稿的職官門內尚保存了關於這一機構的一些史料，今即根據會要所載，略述「看詳編修中書條例所」成立的用意和經過如下：</p>
<p>在宋神宗元豐三年（一〇八〇）改革官制之前，在中央政府的衙門當中是有兩個中書省的：其一是在皇城外邊的兩廡中，與門下省並列，也和門下省一樣的有名無實，只佔有官舍幾間，職權是「但掌册文，覆獎考帳」。另一個是設置在禁城中的朝堂西側，也稱爲政事堂，這里才是宰相辦公的地方。禁中的中書，與樞密院分當天下的軍民之政，通稱爲二府。熙寗初年所設置的「看詳編修中書條例所」，其對象是禁中的那個中書，而不是帛城外兩廡內的那一個。</p>
<p>歷代宰相的職任，本是「治國經邦，變理陰陽」，對於軍民財賦的大計本是無所不統的。但在北宋前半期，却不但把軍機分屬於樞密院，財政大權也分給了三司使副，其目的，是在防範因宰相事權太高而致發生專擅篡竊的流弊。宰相的事願旣經這樣分割，宋代宰相的政務似乎應較歷代的宰相清備一些才是，事實却又不然。</p>
<p>北宋中葉以前，其設官分職，有與歷代大不相同的地方：在名義方面它是分爲「官」，「職」和「差遣」三種的。其所謂「官」，只是用以區分階級的名銜，即宋史職官志所說的「官以寓祿秩，叙位著」。其所謂「職」，如「集賢殿學士」或「龍圖閣待制」之類，是專以授予有文名和有淸望的人。這兩種名義全都沒有實際的任務，貼職是「龍岡閣待制」的，並不真到龍岡閣去服務；而做到了六部的尚書侍郎以至於丞郎員外等官的，也並不眞到那一部中去工作，都是只膺其名而不任其事。這一些具有中央政府官員頭銜和各種殿閣職名的人，其實際的任務也許是到各路去作監司，也許是去作各州府軍監的長吏，其所承擔的這份實際任務，便呌做「差遣」。「名」和「實」旣如此其混淆，「職機」和「責任」遂也極不分明，和今日戲劇舞臺上的所謂「客串一和「反串」頗爲近似。單就中書省而論，具有中書省的職員名義的人旣都到中書省以外的機關去一分　庶務」，中書省各部各司的事情則「類以他官主判」，即差派具有別的機關的職員名銜的人到中書省來服務。職員旣都是客串乃至反串而來，而又大都遷轉無常，平時且未必有足够的員數，因而，這一個中書省的事情，不但是「治國經邦，變理險陽」的大端，小而至於簿書細務，也都有待於宰相或執政人員躬親處理。其結果，由於細務之繁夥，反而使得宰相和執政們不能有從容的時間去思考國家大計，於是而「淸中書之務」乃成了當時一般明達治體的人們所同有的主張。</p>
<p>「看詳編修中書條例司」之所以成立，其近因之一，便是因爲中書事務猥積而致有處理錯失了的事件之故。宋會要職官類編修條例司門記其事云：</p>
<p>神宗熙寗二年四月八日同天節，太常禮院請如治平四年羣臣詣閤門賀，上曰：「治平四年及先帝靈駕在殯之日，今兩宮太后萬壽，不可令禮官引用居喪之例。蓋朕於人子之情不忍聞也。可止令云：同天節日宰臣文武百僚並當赴東上閤門拜表」王安石因言：「此誠中書失於省閱。中書事猥幷，若不早置屬，以衆事歸之有司，則無可爲之理。」</p>
<p>上謂富弼曰：「今欲治，當自中書省。中書省置屬，宜精選小官。」</p>
<p>曾公亮曰：「丞相府宜用敦檏人，故本朝不用進士，但用學究。」安石曰：「當選在下豪傑之士，令編修條例，點檢文字。」</p>
<p>六月十四日，上謂王安石曰：「中書置屬修例，最是急事。」</p>
<p>安石曰：「此乃事之本也。凡修例者，要知王體，識國論，不爲流俗蔽者，乃可爲之。若流俗之士，所見不能出流俗，即所議何能勝舊？今陛下欲修條例，宜先博見士大夫，以陛下聰明睿智，躬擇賢士大夫，必得其人。若得五六人以付中書令修條例，每數日輒一具事日進呈，是非決於陛下，則法度成立有期。若但令中書擇人，即恐所用不無流俗之人，流俗之人何可與議變流俗之事？凡今日條例皆仁宗末年以來大臣所建置，人情豈肯一旦盡改其所建置以從人？恐須陛下獨斷，乃能有為。」</p>
<p>上曰：「待朕自選得人但恐遲。」</p>
<p>安石曰：「此事誠不可遲，然亦不可疾。若不知王體。識國論·可與變流俗之人，則與不修條例無異，此所以不可疾也。然今非無人材，要須陛下留意考擇，恐亦不可遲也。」</p>
<p>九月十六日，條例司檢詳官李常呂惠卿看詳中書編修條例。先是，王安石數爲上言：「今中書乃政事之原，欲治法度，宜莫如中書最急，必先擇人令編修條例。」因極稱惠卿及常，遂並用之。……</p>
<p>上以朝廷所省閱多有司之細故，而大臣不得講明政事之大者，以爲事可歸有司者歸之，而中書責其當否，則有司盡力而事治。故命條例司討論，去其繁冗，自是事歸有司者寖多，而中書之務清矣。（職官五之八至一一）</p>
<p>中書省舊來的事務究竟繁冗到何等程度，現今經這個「看詳編修條例所」所淸除了的又是一些什麼事體，我們可從會要中得到很多的例證，今也以兩事爲例：</p>
<p>例一：過去，凡新被差除的官員，應該由政府給一些什麼，賜賞一些什麼，本都有定章可援，但却仍須經由中書查明定章通知三司照發才可；宗室中有新受差除或封號的也如此。編修條例所認爲這是一合歸有司」的事，便加以更改，嗣後不論官員或宗室新受差除，其應有的支賜，由三司直接依照定章辦理便行了</p>
<p>例二：以京朝的頭銜而到外路州軍去担任親民或　務差遣的人，如因遷葬等事而乞假，在過去是必須由轉運司申報朝廷，再由中書省特降聖旨批准才行。編修條例所認爲這也是「合歸有司」的事，便也加以變要，嗣後凡上述人員因還葬等專請假的，只須經轉運司查明屬實即可給假，不必再等候中書省特降聖旨了。</p>
<p>經編修條例司淸除掉的繁冗之務，會要雖也記載了幾十事，而其所不載的一定還有好多，因之我們還不能知道所淸除的共有若干條目。到熙寗八年十月二十二日，其時王安石罷相已經一年半的時光，這個編修條例所便因爲「取索文字，煩擾官司，無補事實」，而與「修司農寺條例司」一同廢罷了。</p>
<p>宋會要官制別錄門載有神宗正史職官志的一段序文，有云：</p>
<p>太祖太宗監　鎭之弊，乃以尚書郎曹卿等官出領外寄，…朝因仍，無所改革，百有餘年，官寖失實？…神宗即位，慨然欲要張之，謂中書政事之本，首開制置中書條例司，設五房檢正官，以淸中書之務，又置制置三司條例以理天下之財，…於是法度明，庠序興，…豐豐乎董正治官之實舉矣，然名未正也。</p>
<p>這一段話是說，改革官制的事雖是在元豐時侯才施行的，但在熙寗中間王安石當政之日，已經從實際方面着手於官制的「董正」了，對於「制置中書條例司」淸除了中書冗務一事，更認爲是修明法度的大事件。我們試衡量一下「編修條例听」的全部工作，覺得神宗史志這段話未免褒獎太過。因爲，這個「看詳編修中書條例所」的設置，旣然是以修明法度爲目標，而在王安石的本意當中，要是要使新的法度能「合乎先王之政」的，當時中書事務繁冗固是應該改革的事，但有關法度的最本原的問題却絕非此事。諸如「中書令不預朝政」，「侍郎不領省職」，「諫議無言責，起居不記注」，「中書常關舍人」，「司諫正言不任諫諍」等事，亦即所謂「居其官不知其職」，「事之所寄，十亡二三」，與所謂「名寶齋雜，員額冗濫」諸弊，這些才是應當「改易更革」的急先務。編修條例司放開這些最本原的問題不予修改，只將甲書省　繁冗事務略予淸除，總不能不算是捨本逐末的。（三十七年三月十一日寫完）</p>
<h3>隋書百官志後周祿秩解</h3>
<p>— 陳垣</p>
<p>文字本欲人易曉，然北周時曾一度復古，有極顯淺之事實而以極紆廻之文字叙述之，如隋書廿七百官志周制祿秩條是也。今先引原文而解釋之如後：</p>
<p>周制：祿秩，下士一百二十五石，中士已上至於上大夫，各倍之，上大夫是爲四千石。</p>
<p>卿二分，孤三分，公四分，各益其一。公因盈數爲一萬石。</p>
<p>其九秩一百二十石，八秩至於七秩，每二秩六分而下各去其一，二秩俱爲四十石。</p>
<p>「中士以上至於上大夫各倍之」者，謂中士二百五十石，上士五百石，下大夫一千石，中大夫二千石也。</p>
<p>「卿二分，孤三分，公四分，各益其一」者，謂卿益上大夫之二分一爲六千石，孤益卿之三分一爲八千石，公益孤之四分一爲一萬石也。</p>
<p>「八秩至於七秩，每二秩六分而下各去其一」者，謂八秩以下，每二秩各去九秩之六分一，故八秩七秩百石，六秩五秩八十石，四秩三秩六十石。二秩一秩四十石也。吾始疑原文末句有脫字，應作「一二秩但爲四十石，」後據通興三五祿秩門，册府元龜五。五俸祿門所引，果作」二秩一秩俱爲四十石」，知今本隋書實脫「一秩」二字，疑乃大白。試列爲表，則一目了然。</p>
<p>後周祿秩表：</p>
<p>下士　一二五</p>
<p>中士　二五〇</p>
<p>上士　五〇〇</p>
<p>下大夫　一·〇〇〇</p>
<p>中大夫　二·〇〇〇</p>
<p>上大夫　四·〇〇〇</p>
<p>右各倍之·</p>
<p>卿孤公　六·〇〇〇　八·〇〇〇　一〇·〇〇〇</p>
<p>右遞增二千石。</p>
<p>九秩　一二〇</p>
<p>八秩七秩　一〇〇</p>
<p>六秩五秩　八〇</p>
<p>四秩　秩　六〇</p>
<p>二秩一秩　四〇</p>
<p>有遞减二十石</p>
<h3>王韜的卒年</h3>
<p>— 徐光摩</p>
<p>天南遯叟王韜生於道光八年，公元一八二八。可是關於他的卒年，還沒有確實的記載。　　先生在他的中國文學史大綱裏說他「光緒二十一年死·」（三百三十頁）現在據我考察，這實在是一個錯誤。</p>
<p>洪深先生在戰前寫的「申報總編篡長毛狀元王韜者證」一文，（見生活書店發行的文學二卷六號）關於他的去世年月就沒沒考定。筆者每留心到這一方面的材料，而終於在一部不大令人注意的梅　吟草的序文裏，解決了這個疑問。</p>
<p>梅　吟草是一部小型鉛印本的詩集，是徐兆闌著的。徐爲吳縣人，和王　是鄉友，集子裏記載兩人的友誼是很密切的。集前共有題序七篇，除了徐氏自己做的一篇外，另外六篇的執筆人爲王韜，俞樾，陳德濬，繆少初，吳廣需，劉嘉樹諸氏。王韜做的序題光緒癸己，即十九年。俞曲園做的序是光緒二十一年乙未寫的，序內說：</p>
<p>『乙未春，先生與大南遯叟訪余吳門春在堂，袖出梅　吟草問序於余。……』在這裏可以知道王韜於光緒二十一年還是健在的。繆少初的序文有道樣的話：『君（指徐氏）幼工舉業，酷嗜篇章，與天南遯叟，茶麝山人皆桑梓友，時相徵逐詩酒間。……茶磨往矣，遯叟於今秋歸道山，悵舊雨之難逢，嘆新詩之如錦……』此序末署「光緒丁酉冬，廬山少初繆蕁聯誌。」丁酉爲光緒二十三年，那麼王韜是在光緒二十三年秋季去世的，這問題總算得到解決了。（民國三十七年一月二十三日大雪之夜草成于栗林）</p>
<p>編者後記</p>
<p>徐光摩先生從宣城寄這篇短文來，讓我們知道王韜死在光緒廿三年丁酉，公元一八九七。這個小考證，有許多學者一定歡迎。美國近年新出版的「淸代名人傳略」（Eminent　Chinese　of　theChing　Period，ed．by　ArthurW．Hummel）有我的朋友Roswell　S．Britton寫的王韜傳（頁八三六—八三九）說他生於一八二八年十一月十日（陽曆），但也沒有考定他的卒年。前年我才聽說上海有朋友已考定王韜死在光緒二十三年，享年七十歲。我曾在我的一本世界大事年表上，把他的死記在這年，但當時沒有註出來源，也沒有說是何人考定的。（倘有人指出，我很感激。）徐光學先生引的繆夢聯的梅　閒吟序，是可信的證據。王韜雖不是「長毛狀元」，確是申報的論說主筆人。我盼望申報編輯部能費歟工夫翻檢光緒廿三年秋季的舊報，給王韜的死年作一個最後的定論。胡適。卅七，二，廿五。</p>
<p>遍翻淸光緒二十三年正月至十二月二十四年正月至三月本報，並無關於王韜之紀載，僅於光緒二十三年十一月初四日廣告中有一則云：「術擅岐黃」，上款爲「鏡湖仁兄司馬大人雅鑒」，下款爲「天南遯叟王韜題贈」，蓋題贈一醫生者，然亦不足以證明其在是時尚存也。——本報資料室</p>

<p>自由談</p>
<h3>「車夫」與「司機」</h3>
<p>— 靖文</p>
<p>取消「汽車夫」的稱號而改稱司機，業已由有關當局正式公告。這雖然是一個小問題，但也會因此在內地和上海引起過不少次的風潮。司機的原是一種技工人員，過去以「夫役」目之，祇是因爲歷來對於服役人的人，一向都給他們拖上一個「夫」的尾巴。例如校工在過去稱爲「齋夫」，抬轎子的呌「轎夫」，燒飯的呌「伙夫」，而拉車開車的一律稱做「車夫」。</p>
<p>不過據我想，「夫」的稱呼不一定是壞的，譬如北方人稱醫師做「大夫」，從前的婦女們都希望能做到一品「夫」人，如果有人尊稱你一聲「夫」子，你一定不會認爲這是侮辱。而爲太太們鞠躬盡瘁的人呌做丈「夫」，頂天立地的男子漢又稱爲大丈「夫」。足見一樣一個「夫」字，就有這麼多的用處。何况國家興亡，匹「夫」有資，更是說明了普國之民，人人皆「夫」。</p>
<p>「夫」的稱呼旣不壞，則「汽車夫」似乎也不必斤斤於司機之構了。然而問題却不是如此，因爲你我都知道過去一般人對於「汽車夫」的稱呼是多少會有一些不敬的意味的。抗戰之後，在一滴汽油一滴血的口號下，司機員工在後方的社會地位日見重要，始使人們過去的觀感一樊。而且事實上司機的確是司理的機械，和單純靠人力的拉車者畢竟不同，故爲名實相符起見，確也是以司機的稱呼爲得當。</p>
<p>歐美人稱汽車的駕駛者爲Chauffeur，日本人稱之謂「遝轉手」。Chauffeur一字的語源爲何，不甚詳悉，但「運轉手」三字鄙意認爲較之「司機」兩字似乎更能名符其實，恰到好處。足見日本人在許多地方確乎有些小聰敏。</p>
<p>不過正名雖然重要，但要提高一種職業的社會地位，却並非單在名義上樊花樣所能成功。無論在歐美或日本，駕駛汽車的職業，原和其他職業一樣的有其社會地位，一樣的受人尊重。不僅是司機爲然，其他任何以技能或勞力換取生活的人，亦絕少會受社會的歧視，更不會因職業地位而發生名義問題的侮辱感。</p>
<p>鄙意認爲職菜名義的侮辱感，一半固起於社會尚多不平等的因素，而另一半原因則恐怕應歸之職菜者自身的職菜道德與職業風氣。尤其是在今日我國的社會中，職業道德與職業風氣，關係某一職業界的社會地位頗大。</p>
<p>在過去，職業的酬報往往被看做是職業地位的分界標準，好像錢賺得愈多，職業愈是高尚。例如士農工商的排列，就表示這種心理。從前做官是一等職業，「讀書人」的專利品，所謂學而傻則仕。其次便是一襲長衫的薪水階級。海關，郵局，銀行都是當時的「金飯碗」，那怕是教書先生，從前也是了不起的職業。</p>
<p>可是現在則異是。若照過去以賺錢多少爲職業地位分界的標準，則今日的勞工階級無疑該居職業界的皇座了，而從前了不起的，現在恰好顚倒了位置。所以就職業言，今天的勞動者實再無自感卑賤的必要。然而提高職業的社會地位，却並非完全決定於酬報，而是職業的道德與風氣。</p>
<p>爲爭取職業的榮譽，正名自然重要，但正名並非僅爲　名義，而更應重視提高職業的道德與職業的聲譽。將來的社會不論改變何種制度，但憑技能與勞力爲生的人，終必是社會的柱石。在這一信念下提高自己的職業修養，就可擊破社會的任何偏見與自我的卑辱感。</p>
<h3>馬歇爾軼事</h3>
<p>— 英民</p>
<p>有一天，馬歇爾夫婦開汽車畢到加油站去加油，油加好後，正要開走，一輛軍用車開到，恰好擋住去路。兩個二等兵跳下車來，就站車窗外面和他們的女朋友談笑，一面說一面笑，似乎非當開心。</p>
<p>一直等了五分鍾，話匣子還沒有完，最後馬歇爾伸出頭來，招呼說：「請把你們的車子開過一點護我出去。」</p>
<p>這兩個兵看了他一眼，仍然轉過頭去和女朋友說話。過一時，他們四人一齊走進加油站去，把車仍停在那裏，當他們經過馬歇爾的汽車時，向他說：「夥計，你斯文點罷！」</p>
<p>十五分鍾後，他們回到家裏，馬夫人向她女兒解釋遲回家的緣故，女兒問道：「父親怎麼辦了呢？」馬夫人說：「他倒就很斯文了呢！」</p>
<h3>白領階級</h3>
<p>— 寄漠</p>
<p>若干年前，讀到一個美國人所寫的政治經濟史，看見「資本主義」，「小資產階級」等名詞，當時有一點覺得異樣，又有一些新奇的意味，迎帶我還讀到了「白領階級」這字眼。</p>
<p>「白領階級」這釋名似係直譯。我國穿西服，襯衫領雪白的人果然很多，不過，如果釋爲一長衫階級」，也許較易獲得我們的了解。倘使我們再將「長衫階級」解釋爲「薪水階級」，那末環顧社會中，熙來攘往者，到處皆是，更有一種身親體會之感。</p>
<p>自二次大戰以來，白領階級的待遇，較之非白領階級，即工人階級，向居下風。美國新開出版公司曾將二者的收入，自一九四〇年起至一九四七年九月止，畫了一幅比較統計圖。在一九四〇年，相去有限，一九四一年起便逐步拔開，至一九四四年更相去一大截。大戰結束以後，前者的待遇會急起直追，但隔不了多少時候，又呈望要莫及之勢。截至一九四七年第三季，二者依舊相差百分之二十左右。</p>
<p>因此，美國最近的傾向，不少證券號，電力公司，保險公司等職員，頗有脫去白襯衫，改入工廠的趨勢。「寫字間工作」已不若過去的惹人注意。</p>
<p>日前我到一家企業公司去看一個朋友，他是在那裏當會計的。穿了西服，可以說是一個標準的白領階級。我跟他談了片刻，或者因爲這幾天肥皂漲得太凶的關係，發現他的襯衫久未洗　，衣領上泛成一片灰色。我想再過幾天，這一位白領階級也許離黑領階級不遠了，假定我們還有黑領階級的這一種區別的話。</p>
<h3>欣賞「偉大」</h3>
<p>— 何苦</p>
<p>代友人到銀行裏去取一筆匯款，是一千萬元，拿到的是一疊紅色五千元關金，輕而易舉，放在袋中也不覺得什麼。這一種鈔票，雖然和我們見而，已有三月多，但放到自己袋襄有如此整整一疊，雖然只是一時的過手而已，可是寒酸得很，還是第一次。</p>
<p>這一張鈔票，現在祗能換到二十塊燒餅，差供一日一人果腹之需，若在古人詩裏，却足以到烟花二月的揚州去玩一次：「腰纏十萬貫，騎鶴上揚州」，其豪華等於坐了霸王飛機到北平去暢游一樣。因此在數字上看，我們的時代够偉大，任何豪富的古人，自鄧通，計然，下迄淸末的閹臣和珅，都沒有我們一個公務員這樣的多金，十萬貫有什麼希罕，只及今日的三百多元，迎路上的呌化都要棄如敝屣的數目！</p>
<p>西洋人以百萬富翁爲了不得的人物，而今日任何一個小職員的收入，至少就可以抵到西洋的幾個「百萬當翁」，從這一點看來，中外人仕的安宮尊榮就只值得我們的白眼。有許多臨動一時的事情，在今人看來，就不免令人啞然失笑。不必去翻什麼歷史上的老賬，就拿二十年前的近事來說：南京有一位市長太太，買了二十五元一雙絲襪，居然被當作新聞一樣傳播，嘖嘖稱羨者有之，肆意攻擊者有之，訕笑譏嘲者有之，討論官守不正者有之，熙熙攘攘，着實熱鬧過一個時期。若在今日看來，依我自己來說，買了一雙普通紗襪，其代價正是上文所說的紅票一張，計十萬元正，但並未構成轟動遐邇的新聞，也沒有人來攻擊我的操守如何不正，懷疑我的收入有否非法，羨慕我的享用怎樣豪奢，嗤笑我的身份十分不稱。關鍵在於人人要買十萬元一雙襪，區區二十五元一雙襪，便是請紙紥店糊一雙冥器裏用的，也一定被店家拒之於千里之外的。從前二十元一雙襪能够構成新聞，今日的十萬元一雙襪反成爲普通現象，所以我說這是時代的偉大，假如政府一旦把幣制改革過來，那龐大的數字便到此爲止，偉大的時代被截成段落，這段落有個名稱，便是「空前絕後」也。</p>
<p>我當說今日的貨幣數字，應該欣賞重於實用用，換言之，對於今日貨幣的看法，是臨於望梅止渴式的，「渴」是代表鉅富，當你想一想這數字，你便覺得自己過着富翁的生活了。</p>
<h3>談三國戲</h3>
<p>— 倚虹</p>
<p>出年，皮黃流人北平時，以三慶班（現稱之爲老三慶）人才爲最盛，生角佔有三個首席，一爲漢派之余三勝一爲徽派之程長庚（戲班稱之爲大老板），其一則爲盧勝奎（同行稱之爲盧台子）。</p>
<p>盧臺子本爲一不第秀才，胸中深通文墨，屈居人下，鬱鬱不得志，然以班中環境如此，終不能與程余爭長短，不演前塲時，即與程余充配角，如探母之六郎，戰蒲關之王霸，珠簾塞子陳敬思，搜孤之公孫杵臼，儼然置於硬裏子地位，即今日所謂之二路老生也。盧嘗引以爲憾，乃於暗中參考三國演義，特編全本三國誌一劇，由話葛亮舌戰羣儒起，六出祁山七星燈孔明歸天止。劇成，就教於大老板，程大爲重視，首以其中羣英會一折演出，其中人物之配搭，大老板飾諸葛亮，余三勝飾魯肅，徐小香飾周瑜，錢實峯飾黃蓋，劉赶三飾蔣幹，盧亦兼飾諸葛亮魯肅兩角，此劇試演後，風靡一時，大老板見盧之劇中動作，傳神入骨，栩栩生動，對盧轉移視綫，大爲賞識，以後再演三國誌時，即改以盧分飾劇中主角，虛名鵲起，由此，慮在舞壇亦得揚眉吐氣矣。</p>
<p>全本三國誌共分二十三本，述台接演，可演二十三天。戲班老例，每屆臘月，因天氣嚴寒，塲中無暖氣設備，觀衆畏寒，如無好戲，決難呌座，非演本戲，不易維持，盧台子編成全本三國誌新戲後，大老板以爲有呌座力，乃以此劇於臘月中演出，由臘月初一起上演，速演二十三天，風雪無阻，每天一本，適至二十三祭灶日演畢，最末一本即爲封箱戲，此劇繪聲繪色，文武並全，崑亂雜陳，爲本戲中最精彩者，老三慶對於此劇，每年一度演出，每演樓上包廂預定一空，即散座亦爲長期觀客，足以想見此劇之眞價值矣。</p>
<p>前淸末葉，老三慶報散後，此劇一時無人演唱，直至葉春善創辦富連成科班，覓得原本，乃續排全本三國誌，首由喜字輩演出，未見精彩，連字輩如馬連良，程連喜，駱連翔，蘇連漢等演出時，乃較初演爲精彩，然其所演，至封箱時不能演全，演至戰長沙，即告封箱，斯爲美中不足。其中馬連良之生角，程連喜之小生，駱連翔之武生，蘇連漢之花臉，均有可取。以後富字輩，盛字輩再演時，則不如連字輩人才之盛，世，元兩輩則以旦角取勝，對於三國誌一劇已不重視，自富述成解體後，全本三國誌因角色不易湊集，無復再能全本演出。現時在舞台上所能見者，僅其中之拆演，欲窺全豹，已不可得矣。</p>
<h3>後之刑死除廢</h3>
<p>— 石文</p>
<p>去年蘇聯廢除死刑和無期徒刑後，曾獲得世界各地的密切注意，因之英國也曾有廢除死刑之意，但結果未能實行。</p>
<p>我們且看一看：蘇聯廢除死刑之後怎樣呢？</p>
<p>最近，柏林的蘇聯駐軍法庭中開審十四個納粹戰犯，這十四位魔王曾在薩克遜霍森集中營內將十萬各無辜男女慢慢地用毒刑害死，罪證確實，被告們也都俯首無辭。</p>
<p>論理，殺人者死，何況這十四個惡魔于中喪生的人們竟達十萬人之多！但是，在判決的時候，他們每個人都逃了性命，——各處徒刑二十五年。</p>
<p>徒刑二十五年已經是蘇聯目前最重的處刑了，法官不能不這樣判，然而他自己也切齒痛心，承認自己量刑過輕了。</p>
<h3>逍遙花</h3>
<p>— 陳慎言</p>
<p>第十二章　萍水姻緣　（一〇三）</p>
<p>次日，綺紈來到柳如家裏，柳如對綺紈道：「我昨犬在談話之問，巳看出島雲所銳的話，十有八九是靠不住的，他說大本營在香港，你可以和他同到香港實地察看，若是他所說的話是空盧的，趁早想辦法，不要再誤你的前途，因爲我耳聞他已經結婚，家眷是不是在香港，我就不大明白，只須你一到香港，一切眞相都可以暴露出來。」綺紈道：「我對他也很懷疑，今天回去，就要求他到香港，看他如何。他若是心處，一定推諉不去，我便可以和他決裂。」柳如道：「事情不要如此魯莽，你不妨察看情形，你第一步先要求去香港，等他不答應時，你再來和我商量。」當下他母女商妥之後，綺紈回去，見島雲匆匆忙忙，正在收拾東西，綺紈很是奇異，問道；「你收拾這些東西幹什麼？」烏雲道：「我船票已經定好了，明天就上香港去。」綺紈見說，倒出意外，問道：「眞的嗎？」島雲笑道：「我們不是這種計劃嗎？到上海在上兩天，便須到香港，我們大本營是在香港，時間不能再躭擱了，因爲有許多事，却要等我到香港解決。」綺紈見他如此說法，出於意外，說道：「這個也好，我們明日就走，我須通知母親。」島雲道：「我想老人家見你來上海幾天，又要到香港去，一定不願意的，你須要慢慢說去了不久，便可以回來，等回來之後，我們再大請客。」綺紈見烏雲所說的話，都出於意外，笑道：「我已經告訴我母親，母親聽說你的大本營在香港，也希望我去參觀，回來給母親報告，好呌她歡喜。」島雲聽了，呆了一呆，問道：「你母親大概很注意我的香港大本營吧？」綺紈道：「這個當然的。」島雲道：「現在在草創時期，沒什麼可參觀的，至少須半年以後，才有成績。」綺紈見他言辭不似在北平時那樣誇張，知道他已膽怯，仍笑道：「你不必和我客氣，我知道你廣交游，香港許多大財東，都是你的後援。」島雲道：「事情不見得那樣簡單，你到那裏就知道了！」當下綺紈不便再說，只幫着烏雲，把應帶的東西，收拾好了，第二日二人到柳如家裏辭行，柳如背地裏，仍再三叮囑可囑綺紈，到香港務要察看情形，不要姑息，一切要當機立斷。當日留二人款待半日，親送他們上船，才行回去。（本章完）</p>

<h3>丈夫為國捐軀　呼籲謀求職業　曾受高等教育學識優良</h3>
<p>編輯先先：我是一個抗戰軍官的家屬，不幸丈夫陣亡於三十二年十二月的緬甸戰役，那時還有一個兩歲的男孩，寡婦孤兒，從此就　着慘痛的生活。當初一年由後總隊部（亡夫是學兵隊畢業）撫　百萬元·國家的卹金，一直到三十五年共計還不到七十萬元，去年的卹金，託人與自往，費了三月的時光，逓糧代金在內，只有四十二萬元，這樣的一點卹金，我們母子如何生活呢！</p>
<p>本來也有翁姑在宴，那知他們不認這外面自由結婚的娘婦，更不認這一個無父的孤兒，再三托人央求，也得不到翁姑的收留，說起來令人傷心！我們夫妻的結合，經過三年以上的戀愛，我是受過高等教育的女子，亡夫是一個美國僑胞，當初一般同學，都羨我們的美滿姻緣，現在有社會憐恤我們母子倆呢，</p>
<p>我今年三十五歲了，孩子這麼小，怎樣度今後的歲月？原籍福建，寄寓四川，此刻流落在上海，願祈仁人君子之援助，給我個人一點工作，無論教書（國文，歷史，地理，公民）或是管家，保姆，家庭秘書等職，都可以担任。只要能活下去就够，什麼報酬都不要，請先生刊登貴報一角，籍以呼籲，此請撰安。不幸人古靑啓。</p>

<h3>故都兩故事</h3>
<p>— 半夢老人</p>
<p>神仙鬼怪之事，大都渺渺茫茫，有人以爲是眞有的，有人以爲是全假的，究竟是眞是似，無從加以切實證明。我們於幼小時侯，讀到蒲留仙聊齋誌異一書，總以爲他的寫述，無非憑空捏造，在人世上決沒有如此的怪誕不經，可是一想到「天地之大無奇不有」，則又不敢斷定爲必無。</p>
<p>民國十九年間，我厲南京明瓦廊（地名），同住友好，有五六人之多，各佔一間屋，他們都說我的屋內，常常於夜間，發出極大的聲響，彷彿有人在盛怒之下，把手掌猛擊桌面，又像有人在地板上踱來踱去，鞋聲蹄躂的。但是我夜間在這屋息著，總是呼呼大睡，從來不曾聽見有何種　動，意謂他們所說，大都是捏造的。然而有一吳姓朋友，他年已老，患着多年的咳嗽，每每通夜不眠，他尤以爲的確有這事實，並且聽到不止一次，　　勸我不要再宿此屋，恐怕將來要出什麼凶　，本是一番好意，我雖未會信從，他也不加以反對。因爲我始終未曾目擊，也未曾耳聞，他們　　之，我則姑妄聽之而已。</p>
<p>後來我已罷職家居，偶然遇到北平老同事某君，談及我們大家相熟的褚先生，死的時候，有一段奇怪新聞，（當時我也聞知，但已恍惚。）原來那個褚先生，先在最高法院（從前呌作大理院）任職，後來兼在司法部參事上任事，就在司法部參事室一個桌子上辦公，他是頂老實的，大約每日必早到，兩署同人，無不都知道他。</p>
<p>誰知道褚先生，在某年冬間星期日，忽然無疾故去，死得極快，出人意料，那時大家不甚知道，隔了一日，是星期一，有司法部錢參事，他於早晨到部時，先走進參事室，卸去大衣，洗而，一回頭，見褚先生坐在桌子上，桌子旁邊，站有小孩一人。錢參事向來見他到得很早，旁邊雖添一小孩，也不以爲奇，（因彼時常有帶小孩入署的人。）一轉身間，又走進另一室，見某君案上，有褚先生的報喪條，他就說道，開玩笑也要有分寸，可以謊報人奸亡的麼，某君說，褚先生的確於昨天故去，難道先生竟不曉得。錢參事說，奇怪奇怪，這有事實可證，我剛纔見褚先生坐桌子上辦公，並且桌旁邊還站一小孩，君如不信，可同往一看。於是某君與錢參事同到參事室，誰知一無所有。再問與褚先生坐位相近的人，也未看見褚先生坐着辦公，錢參事大大稱奇。當時還有一個部中同事張君，親眼看見褚先生到部時，褚的坐車在後，他的坐車在前，褚先生的軍，越過他的車，大家一同　進司法部大門，惜未未與之招呼，然則褚先生雖死，可以證明他的靈魂，尚未湮沒了。</p>
<p>某君又說，民國十六年，有一王劍仙到北京，據說這個劍仙，是由甘肅督軍署送來。甘肅的督軍張廣建，看見山中放出一道白光，派人到山中尋覓白光所在，於是發見了王劍仙，請他到署，　次試驗，確實本領不小。後來又知道這王劍仙與某部次長羅君爲同學，送他到北京來，住在羅君宅裏，羅君始終不知其有河本領，也未曾試過他一次，忽然來了一個　氣的人，遠遠的就看見羅君厲處，射出奇怪的白光，就說從前與定菴先生曾說：「青霞之下當爲奇士　。」罷君厲內，必有奇士，否則這白光從何而來。於是親自訪問王劍仙，一見之下，決爲不是普通人，從此便轉到某部總長（總長即部長）的耳朶裏。</p>
<p>這總長本是好奇的人，那年大約是四月間的天氣，急急地設下一個極盛的筵席，請王劍仙坐了首坐，並請幾個總次長相陪，於席間，大家同緊要求王劍仙試劍，一顯身手，王劍仙誰遜不邊，倒說鄙人對於劍術，雖然略知二一，但是功夫太淺，不敢冒昧嘗試，萬一險象發生，有負諸公一番誠意。於是同人再三要求，王劍仙說，試劍之事，暫俟異日，鄙人久住山中，跑路倒是慣常，今日飯後，我與諸公競走一次，以西山碧雲寺爲目標，諸公坐汽車先行，鄙人隨後步行趕來，先到寺爲勝。大家都答應了，忽忽飯罷，幾個總次長，均乘汽車，風馳電掣的，向碧雲寺進發。</p>
<p>誰知王劍仙飯後，慢慢的回到他的住處，掩著室門，在室中　著方步，這住央外面，原有不少男女僕人，交頭接耳，　著王劍仙住室窺探，看他從那一條路走，是如何的走法。不料始終未見王劍仙走出室來，只聽他踱來踱去，約二十餘分筑光景，就無聲息了，估量他必是午後入睡。</p>
<p>這裏各部總次長，坐著汽車，飛快的開到碧雲寺，到得寺門，王劍仙已陪碧雲寺的住持，緩緩走着，迎將出來。王劍仙笑說，我來得不少時候了，你們的汽車，如何走得這樣慢。大家下車，稱奇不置。後來羅次長，回到家中細細詢問僕人，這王劍仙他是如何走的，那些僕人歷述當時情形，幷說並未見他走出，於是就測定王劍仙不是飛行就是土遁了。</p>
<p>這兩個故事，皆出在民國時代的，褚先生的靈魂不散，王劍仙的飛行絕跡，當時在北平的人，大約皆能知其大略，足見世界上奇怪的事很多。褚先生係我的同事，相處有七年之多，他死，並不爲奇，死後還要坐車到部辦公，眞是聞所未聞了。王劍仙單名一個「輝」字，不知他何處人，自此次競走以後，知這自己名氣太大，不能再住下去，就匆匆出京，回到甘肅山裏去，此後不知他究免遁跡何所，也無從考查。一個是「飛行已脫塵凡路」，一個是「逝去猶登傀儡塲」。古人云，半陰半陽是「人」，純陽是「仙」，純陰是「鬼」，人上昇爲仙，下落爲鬼，我們有善心，即上昇，可以成仙，有惡心，即下落，便要作鬼，善惡之分，就是陰陽之分，也就是仙鬼之分，人是逃不出陰陽兩界的，這個道理，恐蒲留仙也未能知道吧。</p>
<h3>春夢</h3>
<p>— 張一渠</p>
<p>七日市關一日開，故鄉春夢又廻轘：林烟欲滴非　露，江水皆香不獨山；碧藻秧田花柳路，靑藤茅屋竹離灣，風光自是家園好，未便家國得往還。</p>
<h3>讀書</h3>

Regarding the number of Manchu legislative members and the funding issues of the association, he made the following remarks: "Last year, I came south with Mr. Pu Ru, representing Manchus from various places to express opinions to the Central Government. I separately visited the various authorities, and the Central Government was extraordinarily concerned about our Manchu compatriots. Specific quotas for National Assembly delegates to participate, but the quotas for legislative and supervisory committee members, and the funding of the Manchu Association, have not yet been determined. A few days ago in Shanghai, I met with Director Yu, who promised to facilitate the matter, and also believed that if these two things are not resolved one day, it will greatly affect the progress of all matters. I believe that the Northeast issue has affected the Manchus the most, and Manchus across the country are paying attention to the future evolution of the Northeast. I deeply hope that the Central Government will relax the standards and provide widespread assistance to the Manchus. I believe that Manchus in various places will be able to break down barriers, work together with one heart and one mind, and assist the government to make contributions. I am carrying a copy of my opinion book this time to Beijing, and I will provide it to the Central Government after a thorough review with Mr. Pu Ru, for reference."</p>

<h3>Civil Aviation Corps Plane Attacked Incident: Our Note to the Soviets States This Action is Unfriendly</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 19th Dispatch] Regarding the incident where a Civil Aviation Corps plane belonging to Chennault was pursued and shot at by Soviet Red Star fighter planes over the Bohai Sea, our country has again lodged a serious protest with the Soviets on the evening of the 18th. According to an external spokesperson on the 19th, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs delivered a note to the Soviet Embassy in China on the 18th, reiterating the Chinese government's protest to the Soviet government on March 10th regarding the pursuit and shooting of a Chinese plane on March 8th. The note begins by stating: the transport plane employed by the Chinese Ministry of Communications, which was attacked by Soviet fighter planes, "has the letters XT painted on its tail." This marking is a nationally registered Chinese aircraft marking. In addition, the transport plane also has the blue and yellow Chinese insignia of the "Civil Air Transport Corps" and the letters CAT on both sides of the fuselage, making it easily identifiable as a Chinese aircraft. Therefore, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs "expresses deep surprise at the Soviet Embassy's note of March 13th, which stated that this transport plane was an unidentified aircraft." The note continues: "China enjoys full sovereignty over the northeastern provinces (i.e., the three eastern provinces referred to in the Sino-Soviet Treaty of August 14, 1945), including the Lushun naval base. This Sino-Soviet Treaty also clearly declares this. The transport planes employed by the Chinese Ministry of Communications have the right to freely fly in any area of these provinces without any interference." Moreover, "the route of the transport plane on March 8th from Shenyang to Qingdao did not pass through the Lushun naval base area. The airspace where the transport plane began to be pursued and shot at by Soviet planes was 45 miles southwest of Lushun, clearly outside the Lushun naval base. The time during which the transport plane was pursued reached 12 minutes, and it was pursued to the airspace near the tip of the Shandong Peninsula." Therefore, the Soviet Embassy's note, which "stated that an unidentified aircraft had violated the border of the Lushun naval base area, not only contradicts the facts but also disregards Chinese sovereignty, and the Soviet plane's pursuit of the Chinese transport plane, reaching the airspace near the tip of the Shandong Peninsula, is clearly an infringement of Chinese airspace rights." The note further states: "Given the current military situation in the northeastern provinces, the above-mentioned obstructive behavior by the Soviet military authorities must be regarded as an unfriendly act." Finally, the note solemnly declares: "Chinese planes have the right to fly without any obstruction in all areas where China has sovereignty, and the Soviet government is requested to strictly prohibit the Soviet military authorities in Lushun from engaging in any similar obstructive behavior as described above."</p>

<h3>Commodity Prices Rose Sixteen-Fold Last Year</h3>
<p>Mr. Gu Yuquan's Speech in Nanjing</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 19th Dispatch] Gu Yuquan, Deputy Secretary-General of the National Economic Council, gave a speech at the Friday luncheon on the 19th, entitled "China's Economic Problems." Mr. Gu believes that there are two major ailments in the current Chinese economy: one is the shrinkage of production, and the other is the soaring of commodity prices. The shrinkage of production has been greatly affected by the past lack of foreign exchange controls, because the large-scale import of foreign goods has greatly hit the production of domestic goods. However, since the implementation of foreign exchange controls, improvements have been seen. Regarding the commodity price issue, Mr. Gu believes that it is very bad. Commodity prices rose sixteen-fold last year, and the price increases can be divided into four periods. The first period was from December 1946 to February 1947, when the commodity price index rose by 68%, with gold and US dollars rising the most. The second period was from late April to mid-June, when the commodity price index rose by 100%, with grain and cloth rising the most. The third period was in mid-September, when the commodity price index rose by 74%, with rice and gold rising the most. The fourth period was from mid-November to the end of the year, when rice rose the most sharply. In total, prices rose sixteen-fold this year, with US dollars rising the most, twenty-three-fold, followed by gold, rising twenty-fold, rice seventeen-fold, cotton yarn fifteen-fold, and coal the least, also rising seven-fold.</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>On Rectifying Political Ethics</h3>
<p>Politics is about managing the affairs of the people. If politics are not clean and honest, the affairs of the people cannot be managed well, and the entire country and society will inevitably experience turmoil. Therefore, if we want to end the war and build the country through constitutionalism, we must first eliminate corruption, reform politics, and establish a clean and capable government to rectify political ethics.</p>
<p>According to reports, the Guangxi Provincial Government's primary task for civil affairs in 1948 is to "strictly enforce political ethics." Its work plan includes the following key points: (1) Register the property of public officials. (2) Severely punish corruption and illegal acts. (3) Strengthen the power of special commissioners to supervise officials, taking examples from the historical period of turmoil when the power of governors was strengthened. (4) Improve the informer system and heavily reward people and subordinates who report corruption. (5) Reduce redundant staff and improve the living standards of public officials. (6) Establish a special incentive system to heavily reward diligent and creative personnel. (7) Strictly practice frugality and improve the social atmosphere.</p>
<p>This "strictly enforce political ethics" plan has been unanimously supported by all parties, and specific opinions have been put forward. For example, Jiang Jiyi, Speaker of the Guangxi Provincial Assembly, advocated "thoroughly implementing the county magistrate reward and punishment measures, without any favoritism." Provincial Assemblyman Liao Baifang also proposed a motion to "require county magistrates to find guarantors," which was also enthusiastically passed. Zhang Weixia, Director of the Guangxi Provincial Department of Civil Affairs, advocated "focusing on production and seeking a way out from developing the natural world. The short-term solutions are (1) carefully using the wise and capable, and (2) psychological reform." Other proposals, such as Central Committee Member Li Renren's advocacy of "high salaries to foster integrity" and Guilin Mayor Su Xinmin's advocacy of "it must be from top to bottom," show that Guangxi Province is about to vigorously carry out the rectification of political ethics, which can be said to be a welcome message in a quiet valley.</p>
<p>Indeed, the rectification of political ethics "should be from top to bottom," "high salaries should foster integrity," the wise and capable should be appointed, county magistrates should be rewarded and punished according to law, redundant staff should be thoroughly reduced, clean and capable officials should be heavily rewarded, and corruption and illegal actors should be severely punished. In particular, the supervisory system should be improved. Not only should flies be swatted, but also tigers should be beaten, so that all the flies and tigers in the country can be wiped out in one fell swoop, in order to eliminate the seeds of corruption and cultivate clean and capable political ethics. However, "governing does not lie in many words, but in focusing on practical action," is also an ancient saying. We sincerely hope to see the day when political ethics are truly rectified.</p>
<p>The two maxims of "frugality nourishes integrity" and "diligence compensates for clumsiness" are the driving forces for cultivating clean and capable political ethics. Throughout history, both in China and abroad, there have never been officials who were extravagant and indulgent and able to be honest and upright, nor have there ever been officials who were lazy and able to be diligent and love the people. Therefore, if we want to build a clean and capable government, we must first cultivate the political ethics of frugality and diligence among all officials. Frugality and diligence are related. A frugal person is often a diligent person. In this country and society, which has been severely damaged by ten years of war and internal turmoil, the cultivation of a frugal and diligent atmosphere is indeed what the objective environment most needs. However, maintaining a frugal and diligent atmosphere must have the condition of eliminating the threat of hunger and cold. In terms of the current living standards of public officials, 70% to 80% of them cannot afford to eat their fill, especially public officials below the county level, who are suffering from hunger and cold and cannot maintain their lives. If the authorities do not find ways to improve their treatment, not only will administrative efficiency be low, but corruption will also form a tacit habit. Therefore, if we truly want to clarify history, rectify political ethics, and ensure that all levels of government across the country, from central officials to the most grassroots public officials, pay wages in strict accordance with the cost of living index, expand the rationing system, and build housing for public officials, so that the problems of food, clothing, housing, and transportation of public officials across the country are reasonably resolved, and there is no fear of cold and starvation. Only in this way can we use severe laws to punish their corrupt crimes after they no longer worry about not having enough to eat or wear.</p>
<p>In this era of the beginning of constitutionalism, in the first lesson of civil rights, from the central government to the local level, from the representative bodies to the government, all are engaged in a booming election. No matter what is being elected, candidates should have the spirit of an athlete. In other words, candidates should compete fairly and should have a spirit of law-abiding, a tolerant attitude, a magnanimous temperament, and a habit of cooperation. An enlightened politician, when running for office, must have the spirit of an athlete in a ball game, "only then can he become a qualified democratic politician." Only in this way can we cultivate excellent democratic policies and embark on the bright road of democratic governance. At the same time, voters across the country must carefully handle their own sacred votes: cast this vote for those who can truly seek welfare for the people and serve the country and society faithfully, and never cast it for those who fight for power and profit and engage in malfeasance; cast this vote for those who are loyal to the country, trustworthy, and enjoy popular support, and never cast it for local despots who commit crimes, betray trust, and are widely resented; cast this vote for scholars, experts, or entrepreneurs who have specialized knowledge and skills, and never cast it for bureaucrats, politicians, local bullies, and landlords who are ignorant and incompetent. On the other hand, the heads of various agencies and local officials must select the wise and capable to assist in governance in order to be motivated and vigorous. Therefore, the selection of the wise and capable from the bottom up and the selection of the wise and capable from the top down are the democratic reforms that should be made in building the country through constitutionalism.</p>
<p>In addition, all levels of government and any official should have the two kinds of political ethics of "public" and "loyalty." How can we be public? The government can be fair and selfless if it makes the economy, administration, personnel, etc. public. Generally speaking, the governments of democratic countries have an obligation to publish financial budgets and final accounts to the people. Not only should financial figures be published, but other figures should also be published as much as possible. Not only should figures be published, but all economic measures should also be made easy for the people to understand and should not have any elements of concealment or deception. Before any administrative measures are decided, they should be announced publicly, and even publicized extensively, so that the people can understand the real situation. The promotion and demotion of government officials should be fair and selfless, the wise and capable should be selected, performance evaluations should be conducted regularly, and promotions and demotions should be made public. Only in this way can we build a clean and capable government and implement democratic constitutionalism. How can we be loyal? The meaning of the word "loyalty" is "responsibility." How can the government and officials be responsible? First, they must be responsible to the country, that is, loyal to the country. As this country embarks on the great era of building the country through constitutionalism, officials across the country and at all levels of government must be sincerely for the country, so that the country can become rich and strong. Because officials are the staff of the government, and the government is the agency that represents the country in exercising its powers. All national policies for building the country through constitutionalism are directly implemented by the central government or ordered to be implemented by local governments. Therefore, all laws and regulations of the country, especially the fundamental law of the country, from the central government to the province, special office, county, district, township, town, bao, and jia, all civil servants should faithfully implement and be responsible for doing them in order to realize the rule of the constitution and complete the scale of a democratic country. Second, they must be responsible to the people, that is, loyal to the people. Officials are the servants of the people, and the government is the agency that seeks the welfare of the people, so of course, it must faithfully serve the people. In this tumultuous country and society, the people bear a heavy burden and suffer deeply. Therefore, the government and officials should visit the people at any time to ask about their difficulties and try their best to solve them. They should also work hard to realize any legitimate demands of the people in order to increase the welfare of the people. Third, they must be responsible for their work, that is, loyal to their duties. The government and officials all have their work or duties to do. In this great era of building the country through constitutionalism, the work or duties of governments at all levels and officials across the country are more arduous than usual, so they must naturally take responsibility, stick to their posts, and work hard with renewed energy. They should also be faithful to their duties, and concentrate their energy to do the work of the day while they are in office. They should also consider the nature of the work, distinguish the priority and urgency, plan the process, and carry it out in an orderly manner. If the government and officials can be loyal to the country, then the constitution will be implemented. If they are loyal to the people, then the people's difficulties will be relieved. If they are loyal to their duties, then the country will be governed. "Public" and "loyal" are the two basic political ethics that should be cultivated and the basic spirit that must be promoted in rectifying political ethics.</p>
<p>Emperor Shenzong of the Ming Dynasty trusted Zhang Juzheng, and the sluggish political ethics of the time changed. Emperor Cheng of the Qing Dynasty relied on Zeng Guofan to reverse the fate of the greedy and corrupt Manchu dynasty. We currently have nothing of lofty ideals to talk about. Where is Zhang Juzheng? When will we have a Zeng Guofan? In this great era of suppressing rebellion and building the country through constitutionalism, we already have a national leader who led us to victory in the war. We only hope that the adults and gentlemen who assist the leader will learn from the examples of the sages, be loyal to the country, bring out a brand-new spirit, lead the majority of pure and good civil servants, and create a refreshing political atmosphere. Reversing chaos and restoring order is the only key!</p>

The Ministry of National Defense requested that the report be reviewed and a commendation order be issued.

In October of last year, he was surrounded by bandits in Linru County, Henan Province. He repeatedly charged and killed, and finally completely defeated the bandits. The regimental commander unfortunately died in the line of duty after being shot. This is deeply regrettable. A commendation order should be issued to commend his loyalty.

<h3>Textile Federation Cables Ministry of Economic Affairs Again</h3>
<p>Requesting to Participate in Compensation Goods Evaluation Committee</p>
<p>[Report from this City] The National Textile Industry Federation held a board meeting on the 18th. Regarding the organization of the Japanese Compensation Goods Evaluation Committee, the Federation had previously requested the Ministry of Economic Affairs to send representatives to participate, but this request was not approved. A resolution was passed to cable again, strongly advocating for participation. The original cable stated, in essence: "Regarding the previous request by this Federation to nominate two representatives to participate in the Japanese Compensation Goods Evaluation Committee, the response was that the selection of committee members had been separately delegated to the ROC General Chamber of Commerce and the China Industry Association. This Federation has learned that the Ministry intends to prioritize the development of the textile industry in the allocation of these machine tools. The request by this Federation to nominate representatives to participate in the evaluation is solely aimed at contributing from the perspective of the industry, hoping to benefit the development of the industry. However, this request has been rejected by the Ministry. At the third board meeting of this Federation on the 18th of this month, unanimous dissatisfaction was expressed... Regarding the request to send representatives to participate, the Ministry has accommodated the Chambers of Commerce and the Industry Association, yet excludes the textile industry, which holds the most significant volume in both industry and commerce. This neglect of the national textile industry organization contradicts the Ministry's intentions. Could reconsideration be given?"</p>

<h3>Prohibition of Using "Lafu" to Meet Military Quotas</h3>
<p>Orders from the Jiangsu Military Control Zone Headquarters to Various Counties</p>
<p>[Report from our Zhenjiang Office on the 19th] The Jiangsu Military Control Zone Headquarters recently noted that counties and townships have occasionally forcibly conscripted displaced people from bandit areas to meet military quotas, which is highly inappropriate. Yesterday, they issued a special order to the counties to pay attention to legally conscripting soldiers in accordance with the law.</p>
<h3>Academic Qualifications of Naval Graduates Have Been Redefined</h3>
<p>Eliminating the Traditional Factional Divisions</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 19th] For decades, factional divisions within the Chinese Navy have greatly affected the development of the navy. After the establishment of the Naval Headquarters, the Shanghai Naval Officer School and the Qingdao Naval Training Corps were first merged. Currently, officer training is concentrated at the Qingdao Naval Officer School, non-commissioned officer training is concentrated at the Taiwan Naval Non-Commissioned Officer School, and shipbuilding, armament manufacturing, and electrical engineering training are concentrated at the Shanghai Mechanical School. Since last year, each school has adopted a provincial quota system for enrollment. The Headquarters recently summoned representatives of graduates from the former Qingdao, Dianlei, Huangpu, and Mawei naval schools to Nanjing to discuss the standardization of their academic qualifications and seniority. More than ten people attended, including Tian Yuehui, many of whom are now key members of the navy. Acting Commander-in-Chief Gui personally presided over the meeting. After three days of meetings, the graduation and seniority dates for students of each school and class have been redefined, and it has been resolved to eliminate school distinctions and request the authorities to reissue unified certificates with the year of graduation. A spokesperson for the Headquarters solemnly pointed out today that this move has resolved the internal problems of the Chinese Navy for the past thirty years, allowing naval development to enter a new stage and establishing a truly unified personnel system.</p>
<h3>Mastermind of the Lanzhou Prison Riot Case Identified</h3>
<p>Most of the Key Figures are Bandits</p>
<p>[Report from our Lanzhou Office on the 19th] The Lanzhou prison riot case at the beginning of the month has been thoroughly investigated and identified as being masterminded by prisoner Shen Dexiang. He took advantage of his role in managing the meals, and that night, while the guards were asleep, stole a pot and opened the gate, releasing over one hundred and fifty prisoners in an attempt to escape. It is also known that he had planned this twice before, but the timing was not right. Most of the key figures in the case are bandits, who will be tried by military law. The case is now being tried by the military court in the local government.</p>
<h3>New Treatments Discovered for Cancer and Pulmonary Tuberculosis</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 19th] News from the China Society of Natural Sciences: (1) Cancer is a poisonous stone that occurs in animal tissues or organs, often leading to death. Scientists have been seeking the causes and methods of treatment in recent years. Recently, the journal "Science" reported that Dr. Heathmi and others at the American Marine Research Institute, while searching for bacteria that decompose petroleum carbohydrates, obtained a bacterium that decomposes petroleum carbohydrates and gains energy for its survival. Petroleum carbohydrates are often used to induce cancer in animals. Therefore, these marine scientists specifically suggest using this trace substance from seawater for cancer treatment trials. (2) The compound ERG, which produces vitamin D, is now being used by Dr. Reb to treat patients with pulmonary tuberculosis. The majority show significant improvement after six months. Examinations of patients with severe tuberculosis show that the number of tuberculosis bacteria is greatly reduced or eliminated. This drug is not a direct germicidal agent, nor does it function by transforming into vitamin D. Instead, it helps patients strengthen their resistance to bacteria, allowing them to recover sooner.</p>
<h3>National Standard Time Zones Redefined</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 19th] The regulations for the implementation of national standard time were amended and promulgated in the 34th year [of the Republic, i.e., 1945], dividing the country into five standard time zones. Now that the nine northeastern provinces have been reorganized and Taiwan has been restored, the originally defined standard time zones should be changed accordingly. The Ministry of Interior has submitted the revised regulations to the Executive Yuan for approval and has ordered all provincial and municipal governments to implement them uniformly. The regulations are as follows: (1) National time is divided into five zones: Zone A, using the time at 127.5 degrees east longitude as the standard, is called the Changbai Zone. Zone B, using the time at 120 degrees east longitude as the standard, is called the Central Plains Zone. Zone C, using the time at 105 degrees east longitude as the standard, is called the Longshu Zone. Zone D, using the time at 90 degrees east longitude as the standard, is called the Xinzang Zone. Zone E, using the time at 82.5 degrees east longitude as the standard, is called the Kunlun Zone. (2) The supply of standard time for all parts of the country shall be jointly the responsibility of the Astronomical Research Institute of the Academia Sinica and the Survey Bureau of the Ministry of National Defense. The Ministry of Interior shall entrust the Central Broadcasting Administration to handle timekeeping matters. The liaison methods shall be negotiated by the relevant agencies themselves and submitted to the Ministry of Interior for record. The time announcements of all private broadcasting stations shall be based on the time broadcast by the Central Broadcasting Station. (3) The time of all telecommunications agencies throughout the country must be synchronized with the standard time of each zone and be responsible for answering people's inquiries about the time (The methods for calibrating the time of the aforementioned telecommunications agencies shall be formulated by the Ministry of Interior in consultation with the Ministry of Transportation). (4) Each local government should set up a radio to receive the standard time of the zone. A specially prepared clock must be calibrated. Local governments without a radio should negotiate with the local telecommunications agency to calibrate their clocks according to the telecommunications agency's time at a fixed time each day. (5) Each local government should set up a standard clock or specially prepared clock and use a noon gun or other signal to transmit the time to the local people to ensure compliance. The management of the standard clock and time reporting should be assigned to specific personnel who are responsible. (6) Clocks in all agencies should be corrected at least once a day, and the correction should be the responsibility of personnel designated by each agency.</p>

<h3>The Overseas Chinese Community in Burma (Part 1)</h3>
<p>— By Our Correspondent, Yuan Wenzhong</p>
<p>[Report from our Rangoon office, transmitted via airmail on the 14th] The number of overseas Chinese in Burma is estimated to be around 300,000. Those originating from Fujian, Yunnan, and Guangdong provinces are the most numerous. The most important businesses they operate are timber, rice, hotels, pawnshops, local products, and general merchandise. They, alongside Indians, control the middle and lower economic forces in Burma.</p>
<p>Overseas Chinese Organizations</p>
<p>When the journalist group arrived in Rangoon on the first day, upon disembarking at the airport, aside from people sent by the embassy and consulate to provide care, no trace of overseas Chinese could be seen. Later, within the ten days in Rangoon, apart from being invited to two receptions and tea parties held by overseas Chinese organizations to welcome Ambassador Tu Yuntan, contact with overseas Chinese was mostly limited to personal interactions. However, in Rangoon, a city with 50,000 overseas Chinese, there are a great number of overseas Chinese organizations. According to the statistics in the Directory of Rangoon Overseas Chinese Organizations and Businesses compiled and presented by the Burma Overseas Chinese Service Association, there are seventy or eighty industrial and commercial organizations, cultural organizations, hometown associations, and other institutions and organizations. However, in their activities, they each act independently. Although there is no significant friction between them, there is no united force.</p>
<p>Party and Government Activities</p>
<p>What we first felt in Rangoon was that the activities of the Chinese Communist Party and the Democratic League of China within the overseas Chinese community were quite active. There are four Chinese-language daily newspapers in Rangoon, and their content is very poor. Many of the news items published are old news from several days ago, and the supplements and other news are mostly copied from domestic newspapers. The largest is the "China Daily", which claims to be the tail of the "Ta Kung Pao" and has the best circulation, approximately over one thousand copies per day. The next is the "New Rangoon Daily", whose chairman is a wavering Kuomintang member. Its newspaper has become a propaganda tool for the Democratic League, spreading speeches and news that undermine the government's credibility every day, with a circulation of several hundred copies. Next is the "National Daily" organized by the Kuomintang General Branch, but its content is not very satisfactory, and its circulation ranks only third. Finally, the Communist Party's "People's Daily", although with a circulation of only a few dozen copies, manufactures rumors every day, attacking the central government and shaking the faith of overseas Chinese in the government. In terms of bookstores, there are three in Rangoon: the Zhengwen Bookstore, the Hua Bookstore, and the Nanchiao Cultural Supply Society. Their scale is very small, and the types of books sold are very few. Among them, the Nanchiao Cultural Supply Society is a stronghold for the activities of the Communist Party and the Democratic League. In addition to newspapers and bookstores, the Democratic League and the Communist Party have recently infiltrated overseas Chinese schools. Recently, the Communist International held a Southeast Asian Youth Conference in India. So-called Chinese representatives from Hong Kong attended, and when they passed through Rangoon, the newspapers greatly exaggerated their visit, and many organizations held meetings to welcome them. Although the embassy and consulate received reports about these activities, due to the different overseas environment, the Burmese government is pro-left, and most overseas Chinese lack understanding of politics. Therefore, they have not yet come up with effective countermeasures.</p>
<p>Overview of Education</p>
<p>Speaking of overseas Chinese schools in Burma, there are quite a few. There are twenty or thirty primary and secondary schools in Rangoon, and as many as one hundred and seventy primary schools in other places. Among them, several schools have spacious school buildings, teach in Mandarin, and the level is quite up to standard. However, most schools teach in local dialects, and they have various common difficulties and shortcomings: First, funds are exhausted, because the government provides almost no assistance to overseas Chinese education. The funds for schools at all levels rely entirely on local overseas Chinese for maintenance, and the general economic capacity of overseas Chinese has generally declined after the war, so the funds for each school have been greatly affected. Second, teaching materials are lacking. Very few national textbooks can be found, and even if some are sent from the country, they are not enough to distribute. Third, there is a shortage of teachers. Good teachers are not easy to hire. In several larger schools, each teacher has to undertake nearly two or more class hours, and teachers in most other schools inevitably fill the ranks without real ability. It is very common for middle school graduates to become middle school teachers, and primary school graduates to become primary school teachers.</p>
<p>Policy Issues</p>
<p>Since Burma's independence, the idea of national economic-ism has been very strong. Under this policy, overseas Chinese have been affected in three main ways: first, larger enterprises will be nationalized by the government; second, imports and exports are entirely controlled by the government, making it difficult for overseas Chinese commercial activities; and third, the promulgation of the Real Estate Act stipulates that foreign nationals with more than 50 mu of land can only sell the excess to Burmese people. However, these influences are not as serious as we imagined. Most overseas Chinese do not seem to have much worry about their property. For example, regarding the nationalization of enterprises, they believe that as long as the government pays the purchase price, it does not matter; and for example, regarding land property restrictions, they believe that as long as they can sell it and get money, is it not the same?</p>
<p>In fact, this policy of the Burmese government is not uniquely discriminatory against overseas Chinese. These measures are only intended to protect the status of Burmese people themselves. Therefore, regarding the issue of the repatriation of overseas Chinese, the Burmese government has been delaying on the pretext that housing and work are difficult to find. So far, approximately six thousand overseas Chinese have returned to Burma for repatriation, while seven thousand are still stranded in Fujian and Guangdong. Recently, after repeated negotiations by our authorities, the Burmese government sent people to China for inspection and has agreed to allow two thousand people to come to Burma this year, of which one thousand can handle the procedures immediately, and another one thousand are still under review.</p>
<h3>Communist Bandit Drug Manufacturing Organization Cracked in Beiping; Three Drug Dens Established in the East, West, and North of the City; Elaborate Secret Rooms Built; Large Quantities of Drugs Seized</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Beiping, 19th] The Beiping Garrison Headquarters' Investigation Department recently took swift action to crack down on a large-scale drug manufacturing organization of the Communist bandits, seizing many drugs and drug-making machines, and capturing ten people involved, including He Xicai. After the Investigation Department had completed a stage of the case's investigation, it invited Chinese and foreign reporters in the area to visit three bandit drug manufacturing organizations set up in the east, west, and north of the city on the 18th.</p>
<p>The Eastern City drug den was located at 8 South Song Bridge, Liusi Alley, Dongsi, which is He Xicai's residence. He is 51 years old, a native of Ningjin, Hebei. His son, Hongji (also known as Mingliang, 28 years old), and his father had no legitimate occupation and engaged in selling drugs and running private silver shops during the enemy puppet period. After the victory, they intensified their activities, colluding with Communist bandits, contacting Lü Yuzhen, purchasing clerk Zhang Ruilin, and their accomplices Li Tongde, Han Furui, Wang Xuexin, An Zicheng, Guo Hongsheng, and others to manufacture large quantities of potent drugs. Lü Yuzhen and others continuously transported large quantities of opium from the Communist bandit Jin-Ji-Cha border area and handed them over to He Xicai and his son, who gathered their gang to build hidden walls and compartments in their residence, opened a factory to manufacture drugs, and hid them in tables and chairs with flexible and sophisticated mechanisms. They also purchased huge amounts of Barbital, caffeine, acetic acid, and other drug-making raw materials, with Ge Yongtai, Bian Mingjiu, and Meng Huankai responsible for manufacturing and purchasing, respectively, and Zhang Dingren, Xu Yunshan, Wang Zengfu, Chen Guoliang, Du Chunhe, and others responsible for sales. In total, for more than two years since the victory, the amount of white heroin and other drugs they manufactured was too large to calculate. The areas where they sold them were mostly Xi'an, Taiyuan, Shanghai, and other places. Each round trip by air could earn them hundreds of millions of yuan, and countless people were poisoned by them, leading to bankruptcy and family separation. In the west room of He's residence, there was a wall with a hidden, easily operated opening mechanism. When the wall was opened, three secret rooms appeared. The rooms contained three-drawer desks and exquisite sofas, all with hollow layers. The rear wall of the secret room was also movable and could be opened, revealing a culvert leading to the cellar, which contained many hidden instruments and drugs.</p>
<p>Bian Mingjiu's house at 20 Fangsheng Alley in the Western City drug den contained drug-making machines, drugs, and transparent paper printed with the "Pine, Bamboo, and Plum" trademark, as well as various too many stamps. When reporters went to inspect, a large number of drug-making drugs and instruments and opium pipes were found on the roof due to filming by the No. 3 China Electric Factory, which was a new gain in this case.</p>
<p>The Northern City drug den was located at Zhang Shouren's house at 22 Xiang'er Alley. A full barrel of chloroform (a potent anesthetic) stored in a large gasoline barrel, as well as six original boxes of Mari Road (approximately more than thirty small boxes, each box worth over six million yuan), two large bottles of acetic acid, and over thirty pounds of caffeine, all drug-making raw materials, were seized.</p>
<p>The above He Xicai, He Hongji, Zhang Shouren, Wang Zengfu, Chen Zuoxiang, Ao Mingjiu, Meng Xingkai, Ge Yongtai, Du Chunhe, Xu Shuman, and other ten people have been arrested, but the Communist bandits Lü Yuzhen and Zhang Ruilin had already used the huge amount of money they obtained from selling drugs to purchase military supplies and taken them to the bandit area in exchange for opium, so they were not caught. The method they used to transport opium was that Li Tongde, who was not arrested, went to the bandit area to purchase it, detoured through Tianjin, hid the opium in bags of sodium sulfide, and transported it to Beiping. From this, the huge organization of the Communist bandit drug manufacturing organization can be seen.</p>
<p>Regarding the insidious nature of their conspiracy, Chief Ni Chaokai of the Investigation Department told reporters: "The bandits conspire to obtain military supplies from us and spare no effort to achieve their goals by all despicable means. The bandit drug manufacturing organization that was cracked this time is one example. The bandits transport the drugs they manufacture to Shanghai, Xi'an, and Taiyuan in exchange for gold, which is then converted into legal currency to purchase telephone machines, automobile parts, and other military supplies, in effect sucking our blood. We hope that the cracking of this case can raise the awareness of local security authorities and pay closer attention to bandits at all times." He also said: "According to investigations over the years, many drug trafficking cases have been discovered, and they may all be related to this case."</p>

<h3>Marshall Emphasizes Seriousness of European and Asian Situation, Resolves to Wage Struggle Against Tyranny, Remains Open to Coordination with Soviet Union</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] New York 19th Dispatch: California Dispatch, Secretary of State Marshall delivered a speech today to students at the University of California, the main points of which are as follows: (1) Warn Italy and other free countries in Europe that if they are controlled by the Communist Party, U.S. aid will automatically cease; (2) The current struggle in the world is a struggle between freedom and tyranny. Domination imposed by force must not be allowed to expand again; (3) The United States maintains the "Open Door" policy and is still willing to resolve various issues with the Soviet Union through coordination; (4) Implement the European Recovery Program as soon as possible to strengthen the self-defense capabilities of Western European countries.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Berkeley, California, 19th] Secretary of State Marshall, on the 19th, received an honorary Doctor of Laws degree from the University of California here. In his impromptu speech, he spoke of the European situation, saying, "Never in history has there been a situation more threatening to our doctrines and interests than the current one." He also said that there are also critical situations in the Middle East, Indonesia, China, Central America, and Latin America. He believes that the United States urgently needs to establish a firm resolution in the universal struggle for freedom and against autocracy in the world. Marshall also warned Italy, declaring that if the Communist Party wins in the general election in Italy, the economic aid that Italy receives from the United States will be cut off. However, Marshall also expressed his willingness to reach an agreement with the Soviet Union, in which case the current dangerous situation could be ended immediately and forever. Marshall emphasized that the United States will never passively avoid current problems with inaction, nor can it disperse its efforts, rendering its strength ineffective. The central issue is where and how the United States should use its power. He pointed out that the dangerous situation exists not only in Europe, but also in China and the Middle East. The United States must also not ignore Latin America and its direct responsibilities in Japan and Korea. Marshall outlined the position of the United States as follows: "Our aim and policy is to adhere to basic principles while maintaining an open door to any general compromise action. We sincerely and earnestly seek a perfect basis for reaching an agreement to end the current situation forever. We will continue to do our best to reach an agreement, but until a genuine solution can be reached, our policy will be to oppose and prevent any further attempts to infringe on the rights and lives of free people. The immediate and effective way to stop this continuing crisis is to quickly and immediately implement the European Recovery Program. The United States has never faced such a serious situation before, and the European Recovery Program is the basis for all our future decisions."</p>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 18th] Secretary of State Marshall departed from Washington today to deliver speeches across the country to raise public awareness of the need for a conscription system and universal military training. He will speak at the University of California at Berkeley on the morning of the 19th, and at the University of California in Los Angeles on Saturday afternoon. He departed on the President's special plane "Sacred Cow" and is scheduled to return to Washington on Sunday.</p>
<h3>How Will the Kremlin React? The World is Watching Closely</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 18th] Diplomatic circles here expect a short pause before Western countries or the United States take new steps to curb the expansion of Communist forces, to consolidate the actions launched in Washington and Brussels yesterday, and to observe Moscow's reaction. Observers disagree on whether Moscow will adjust the current plan of the Communist Information Bureau because of the unity of the West and Truman's guarantee to support this unity. However, continuing to support the Italian Communist Party in its efforts to win the victory in the April 18th general election will undoubtedly continue to be one of Moscow's basic policies.</p>
<p>The next step that Western countries will take will largely depend on Moscow's steps. If Moscow does not launch a new diplomatic offensive, there should not be any surprising developments outside the Soviet-controlled areas for a while. The immediate task of Western countries in the future should be to consolidate the plans they have already announced. Therefore, before the Western European Union has gained a solid foothold, this new international system is not expected to expand immediately. However, if the Soviet government launches a counterattack immediately, it will be a different matter. Therefore, what diplomatic circles are most concerned about at present is any reaction that will be generated from the Kremlin.</p>
<h3>Western European Five-Nation Alliance Will Be Realized Quickly</h3>
<p>Montgomery to Inspect Defense in Belgium</p>
<p>[Reuters, Brussels, 18th] Only 24 hours after the signing of the Five-Nation Alliance Treaty, the Belgian government has submitted a bill to Congress requesting ratification of the treaty. It is expected that the other four countries, Britain, France, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg, will also take swift steps to ratify the alliance treaty. At the same time, the five foreign ministers have decided to convene the Permanent Consultative Committee stipulated in the treaty in Beijing next week to discuss its powers and duties. This is a step to quickly implement the Five-Nation Treaty. The most urgent task is defense and economic initiatives. When British Imperial Chief of Staff Montgomery visits Belgium soon at the invitation of the Belgian government to inspect Belgian military facilities, he will be able to discuss joint defense matters in connection with the five-nation relations.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Ottawa, 18th] Canadian officials said that Canada would be willing to participate when the Brussels Five-Nation Treaty is expanded to accommodate other countries. The official also said that the regional covenant mentioned in the United Nations Charter has flexibility in the word "regional" and is not limited to Western Europe. If it can include all democratic countries, Canada will be happy to participate.</p>
<h3>Northern European Three Nations Unite Against Communism</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Swedish Capital, 18th] The Social Democratic Party held a conference here. Swedish Prime Minister Erlander, Danish Prime Minister Hedtoft, and Norwegian Prime Minister Gerhardsen all attended the meeting and delivered speeches. Erlander said that opposing communism in a democratic way is part of Sweden's plan to safeguard freedom and independence. The stability and strength of Scandinavia are factors for peace. The unity of the Scandinavian countries is not aimed at anyone, and others need not feel threatened. Erlander also said that the Czech incident has exposed the mask of the Communist Party. Sweden will participate in the work of defending freedom and peace, but is unwilling to give up hope of promoting a global national agreement in advance. Norwegian Prime Minister Gerhardsen claimed that although the strength of the Communist Party in Scandinavia is not strong, its threat should not be underestimated. It is expected that the Communist Party in Scandinavia will do its best to disrupt the economy as part of its plan to obstruct the Marshall Plan. Gerhardsen also said that the greatest contribution of the Scandinavian countries to world peace is to assist in the reconstruction of Europe.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Stockholm, 18th] Although international developments, especially those concerning Finland, have not actually changed Sweden's foreign policy, informed sources believe that the Swedish government will take certain steps to consolidate its national defense. If the special funds required for this move are difficult to raise, the Social Democratic government may be unwilling to bear this heavy responsibility alone and will organize a coalition government excluding the Communist Party.</p>
<h3>German Communist Party Establishes People's Committee</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Berlin, 18th] The plenary session of the Second People's Congress closed today and elected a 400-member People's Committee, three-quarters of whom are from the Soviet occupation zone.

<p>[Reuters, Hanover, 18th] British Commissioner Loghen of Lower Saxony told reporters today that due to the evolution of the international situation, a general election may be held throughout the western German occupation zone this year.</p>
<h3>French Military Expenditure is Huge</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Paris, 18th] The National Assembly's Defense Committee recently resolved that French military expenditure for April and May will total 55 billion francs. Communist members voted against the motion during the vote. The bill will soon be submitted to the National Assembly for debate.</p>
<h3>Soviet Union Plans to Abandon Italian Warships to Win Over Italian Hearts</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Rome, 18th] The right-wing "Rome Evening News" reported that the Italian Communist Party has learned from Moscow that the Soviet Union will announce, a few days before the Italian general election, that it will give up the Italian warships that should be distributed to the Soviet Union under the Italian peace treaty, in order to increase Italian goodwill towards the Soviet Union and win over the People's Front controlled by the Communist Party. The Italian warships that the Soviet Union should receive include one battleship, one cruiser, two submarines, and other types of ships.</p>
<h3>U.S. Does Not Attach Importance to Red Army Demobilization</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 18th] The State Department does not believe that the demobilization of the Soviet Army, as claimed by the Moscow Radio Station, has significant meaning. State Department spokesman McDermott said that the reports received by the U.S. government indicate that although there is a level of demobilization of the Soviet Army, another level is being conscripted at the same time.</p>
<h3>France and Italy Adopt Anti-Communist Measures; French Authorities Deport Soviet Nationals; Italy Uncovers Secret Communist Arms Cache</h3>
<p>[United Press, Paris, 19th] The French National Assembly passed a bill on the 19th by a vote of 414 to 183, aimed at taking measures to prevent possible Communist coups or nationwide strikes. The bill empowers the government to appoint eight Inspector Generals and has the power to assist the Minister of Interior in maintaining order during domestic unrest. The bill encountered fierce opposition from the Communist Party.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Paris, 18th] The residence of Audinetz, former chairman of the "Union of Soviet Citizens", was searched last night, resulting in the arrest of twelve people, including Audinetz. According to a Ministry of Interior bulletin, the French government discovered that the "Union of Soviet Citizens", which was ordered to be dissolved by the authorities on December 15 of last year, has secretly resumed its activities, and its guidance committee regularly holds meetings in various places. At the most recent gathering, all attendees were arrested. After interrogation and based on the documents seized, it was confirmed that the individuals had acted in defiance of the French government's orders, and it was decided to deport them immediately. At the same time, the police are also investigating nationals from Soviet-Hungarian-Polish-South African countries.</p>
<p>[United Press, Rome, 19th] Italian Prime Minister Gasperi began a tour of the northern industrial area, a Communist Party stronghold, today to launch a massive campaign. In his speech, he condemned the Italian left for obeying foreign orders. Gasperi felt strengthened by President Truman's guarantee to aid democratic countries. In his speech in Bologna, he expressed his willingness to fully support the Western European alliance to save freedom, peace, and culture. The Italian Prime Minister accused the Communist Information Bureau of setting up secret committees in northern Italy and France to coordinate the Communist Party's schemes in northern Italy and France. He said, "Not voting is cowardice, voting is a responsibility, and voting the wrong way is treason." Gasperi will deliver anti-communist speeches in Bologna, Milan, and other Communist-controlled areas. As the tense atmosphere of the general election intensifies, the police have been mobilized to search for secretly hidden weapons. In recent searches, 56 Communist Party members have been accused of illegally possessing arms. One location contained 200 rifles, 14 submachine guns, 30,000 rounds of ammunition, and wireless transceiver equipment.</p>
<p>[United Press, Rome, 19th] The Communist Party held a mass rally in the city center today. The second-in-command of the Communist Party, Longo, delivered a speech.

<p>[Reuters, Cleveland, 18th] Republican presidential candidate Stassen today advocated that the United States immediately declare the Communist Party an illegal organization.</p>
<h3>World Conference on Freedom of the Press Decides to Open Next Tuesday; The Conference Advocates Giving Journalists Greater Freedom to Work</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Geneva, 19th] The World Conference on Freedom of the Press is scheduled to open in Geneva on the 23rd of this month to discuss the implementation of a declaration made by the United Nations General Assembly sixteen months ago: "Freedom of the press is a fundamental human right and a touchstone of all freedoms upon which the United Nations Organization is based." In addition to all members of the United Nations, those invited to attend the meeting also include Albania, Austria, Bulgaria, Finland, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Portugal, Romania, Switzerland, and Transjordan. The International Organization of Journalists will obtain special status at the conference. The organization will submit specific proposals to the conference to give journalists greater freedom to work, improve the professional capabilities of journalists, and prevent the monopolization of the press.</p>
<p>The United Nations Economic and Social Council, which is hosting the conference, has previously requested governments to send delegations composed of professional journalists, broadcasters, and film workers. The conference will consider drafting a world charter on the rights and obligations of the press and recommend methods for fulfilling this charter, such as through international conventions and the establishment of a world press association, which would have the right to investigate complaints about false and defamatory reports and obstructions to the circulation of news.</p>
<p>Conference Declaration Has Already Been Drafted</p>
<p>In addition, the conference will also issue a declaration clarifying the meaning of freedom of the press.

<h3>Soviet-Supported International Brigades Gather in Northern Greece to Cross the Border; U.S. State Department Receives Intelligence</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 18th] The State Department received a report today stating that three Soviet-supported "International Army" divisions, totaling approximately 30,000 soldiers, are stationed in the Balkans, preparing to cross the border into Greece. The majority of this army is composed of Greeks and Albanians. According to State Department officials, although the accelerated anti-Greek movement proves to be under Soviet military command, the presence of Soviet officers in the command headquarters of this "International Army" cannot be proven. It is unclear whether this trend indicates an imminent attack on Greece or is still part of the Communist Party's psychological warfare.</p>
<h3>Clementis Appointed Czech Foreign Minister</h3>

<p>[United Press, Lake Success, 18th] All indications suggest that the United Nations' discussion of the Czech coup may fade away without any action being taken.

It is believed that the Western allies' hesitation will prevent the Security Council from taking any action.</p>
<h3>Four Powers Discuss Austrian Peace Treaty, Still No Agreement</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 18th] The representatives of the four powers' foreign ministers discussed the Soviet Union's request for German property in Austria. Although the representatives of the four powers made concessions, no agreement was reached. Soviet representative Kokomov stated that the Soviet Union was willing to concede one percent on its request for oil production in eastern Austria, to 66 percent of the total amount, and was also prepared to reduce the amount of cash that Austria was required to pay the Soviet Union by 175,000,000 to $200 million. The Western powers' concessions on the issue of oil production in Eastern Europe would allow the Soviet Union to obtain 50 to 53 percent of the oil production. Regarding oil refineries, the Western powers agreed that the Soviet Union should obtain an oil refinery with an annual production capacity of 400,000 tons, while the Soviet representative insisted that it should be at least 450,000 tons.</p>
<h3>Wallace Criticizes Truman's Policies</h3>
<p>[United Press, New York, 19th] Third-party presidential candidate Wallace issued his response today, targeting Truman's call to restore conscription. He said that the strategy to deter communism has been overextended, endangering the lives of human beings throughout the world. He also said that the United States has no reason to go to war with the Soviet Union. He accused "opportunists" of trying to "obscure the truth" by using the word "communism" to restore conscription and incite a third world war. Wallace said, "Scolding like a shrew" will accomplish nothing. "I call for world peace. Basic land reforms in China and Italy are long overdue. The Communist Party recognizes this and exploits it, but they cannot create anything. The U.S. government dismisses movements that cannot be avoided by the tide of history and simply labels them as 'communist aggression.' I cannot bear to witness billions of dollars, and, more importantly, millions of American lives, being squandered because some American politicians are unwilling to accept simple facts." According to Truman, who announced yesterday that he would rather fail than accept Wallace's support "or that of his communists," Wallace remained silent about this today.</p>

<h3>Minister of Finance Yu and Others Arrive in Shanghai to Promote the Raising of Special Relief Donations, Adopting a Six-Fold Estimated Tax Payment for Enterprise Income Tax, and Inviting Business Leaders in Shanghai to Explain the Reasons</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] Minister of Finance Yu, along with Director Sang of the Ministry's General Affairs Department, arrived in Shanghai by train at 2:15 PM yesterday from Nanjing. According to reports, the main purpose of this trip is to inspect the collection of special relief donations and general tax revenue in the Shanghai area. He is scheduled to attend the second meeting of the Shanghai Area Special Relief Donation Committee, which will be held at the City Hall at 3:00 PM today, where he will explain the central government's specific measures for raising special relief donations and hopes for assistance from all sectors.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 19th] Although the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce has repeatedly telegraphed the Ministry of Finance to consider the method of adopting a six-fold estimated tax payment for enterprise income tax, the Ministry of Finance will still implement the established method.

<h3>New Income Tax Law to be Promulgated and Implemented Immediately, Director of the Direct Taxation Department Talks, Encouraging the Campaign to Eliminate False Accounts</h3>
<p>Wang Fuzhou, Director of the Direct Taxation Department of the Ministry of Finance, came to Shanghai on official business. He told reporters on the 19th: The new Income Tax Law has been revised and passed by the Legislative Yuan and will be promulgated and implemented soon. The new tax law is based on ten years of collection experience and drafted by adopting the opinions of taxpayers as much as possible, so it is a major improvement compared to the old tax law. The characteristics of the new tax law are simple procedures, reduced tax rates, and widespread application. The purpose is to reduce the burden on taxpayers, and at the same time increase the country's tax revenue. Because taxpayers obtain fair and reasonable burdens, tax evasion is no longer necessary, and the losses suffered by the country's tax revenue can be avoided. He continued to analyze the contents of the new tax law, saying that the objects of classified income tax include the following five categories: (1) Business income, (2) Salary and remuneration, (3) Interest income, (4) Property leasing, (5) Temporary income. Except for items (2) to (5), which will be paid by the proposed payer, and merchant income is withheld by the shipping company, the business income tax has been decided to be cancelled. The method of calculation based on the amount of capital, which caused the factor of "false profit and wide tax," has been removed. As for the tax rate, although it is still progressive to 30%, the burden on taxpayers is much lighter than in the past, as the excessive profit tax has been cancelled. Wang said that after the implementation of the new tax law, tax evasion will tend to decrease, which will help improve national morality. However, he said that it is difficult to guarantee that cunning people will continue their illegal behavior, so the punishment for tax evasion will be more severe than in the past. He believes that the business community should urgently launch a "campaign to eliminate false accounts" at this time, and hopes that public opinion will provide strong support. Making false accounts not only deceives the government and damages tax revenue, but also deceives shareholders and reduces their interest in investing in legitimate businesses, which is a major obstacle to the development of industry and commerce.</p>

This meeting discussed the rice rationing liaison methods between cities and strengthening the work of distribution and supervision. According to Chen, the results of the first rice rationing were satisfactory, although there were still some shortcomings, the reason was that the preparation time was too short.

<h3>More Than 100 Families in Shantytowns on Xuchang Road Appeal to the Senate to Postpone Demolition</h3>
<p>More than 100 families in the shantytowns on Xuchang Road and Jilin Road in this city are all refugees from the bandit areas of northern Jiangsu.

<h3>Rice Rationing for Municipal Government Employees Decided to be Five Dou as the Principle</h3>
<p>The municipal government, in order to improve the treatment of employees, has submitted a request to the central government to restore the original ration of food rice for public and educational personnel in this area (i.e., eight dou for staff members, eight dou for technicians, and four dou for laborers).

<h3>The Municipal Government Decides to Reject the Unemployed's Administrative Appeal, Sun Hongyuan is to Blame for the Loose Organization of the Association</h3>
<p>After the incident in which the employees and dancers of the Dance Hall Industry Association of this city destroyed the Social Affairs Bureau, the authorities dissolved the association. Sun Hongyuan, the chairman of the association, then filed an administrative appeal with the municipal government in accordance with the Administrative Appeal Law. The municipal government has now decided to reject it for the following reasons: "The association held a symposium on January 24, presided over by Sun Hongyuan, attended by 34 representatives of musicians, dancers, and employees, and decided to hold a general meeting at Xin Xianlin Dance Hall at 9:00 AM on January 31. A joint meeting was held on January 29, attended by 275 people, presided over by Sun Hongyuan, and it was decided that all would go to the Social Affairs Bureau to petition, and special trucks were prepared for the dancers, and those who did not attend would be punished, employees would be suspended, and dancers would be fined 2 million to 3 million yuan. On the morning of January 31, the general meeting was held, and all employees, dancers, etc. unanimously demanded to go to the Social Affairs Bureau. This is obviously planned by the appellant Sun Hongyuan. It is further investigated that on May 18 of last year, the National Government promulgated the Measures for Maintaining Social Order, which stipulated in Article 2 that the number of petition representatives should be limited to ten. At that time, they did not elect representatives to speak to the handling government, but swarmed into various offices and arbitrarily destroyed them. Even if the appellant Sun Hongyuan's purpose was not to carry out riots, encouraging tens of thousands of people to collectively petition was to cause any unfortunate events. The appellant Sun Hongyuan failed to prevent it in advance, and failed to dissuade it afterwards, which shows that the association's organization was loose at ordinary times, and the appellant Sun Hongyuan is to blame."</p>

<h3>Urban Planning to be Implemented in the Western District of Zhabei, Land to be Expropriated First and then Re-Plotted, Zhao Zukang Talks About Resolutions of the Public Works Conference</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] Zhao Zukang, Director of the Public Works Bureau, recently went to Nanjing to attend the Public Works Conference convened by the Ministry of Interior to discuss the urban planning of the model area in the western district of Zhabei in this city, and returned to Shanghai yesterday morning after completing the meeting. Reporters paid a special visit yesterday to inquire about the progress of the discussion. It is said that the meeting was reported by myself on the progress of urban planning in this city, the importance of the western district of Zhabei, the utilization of its railways, waterways, open space, and land replotting, etc. The following resolutions were discussed and made:</p>
<p>(1) The scope, area, and distribution of land use in the western district of Zhabei, as well as the principle of neighborhood units recently approved by the urban planning, are considered generally feasible. (2) The total area of the western district of Zhabei is 2,500 mu, of which roads account for about 15%. After reorganization, the total number of roads, parks, hospitals, and schools has increased to 40%. The 25% of public land increased after reorganization will be expropriated by the government in accordance with the principles recently passed by the Municipal Senate, and will be gradually implemented in districts and phases. After reorganization, the owners will have priority in receiving land in proportion, except for reserved land. (3) The new Land Law promulgated by the National Government stipulates that the government can expropriate public land needed from the people without re-plotting. Although the procedures are quick, they are not fair. A request has been submitted to the Ministry of Interior to consider amending it. In the future, when the government expropriates public land, it can be shared proportionally by the original landowners. When the Zhabei Western District plan is implemented in this city, it is allowed to follow the precedent of land replotting in Xiaguan, Nanjing, to expropriate first and then replot, so as to facilitate the rapid progress of urban planning.</p>
<h3>Zhang Xiaosong Submits a Statement to Defend Against Charges of Election Fraud</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] The High Court has scheduled a hearing on the 26th for the case of Xie Renzhao and others accusing Zhang Xiaosong, Director of the Civil Affairs Bureau, of election fraud. Xie and others accused Zhang of three points: (1) The number of votes cast does not match, reporting less and more. (2) Requesting the court to preserve evidence to avoid obliteration. (3) Requesting confirmation that the election of legislators is invalid. Zhang then submitted a statement to the High Court a few days ago, stating that he was only the chief director of the election office and not the person in charge, and that Xie's accusations against him were legally flawed.</p>
<h3>British Merchant Tram Wage Issues - Deputy Director Zhao Issues Statement</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The Social Affairs Bureau yesterday convened separate meetings in the morning and afternoon to mediate the year-end salary increase issue for over 300 employees of the British Merchant Tram Company, but a resolution has yet to be reached. According to Deputy Director Zhao: "There has always been a difference between the year-end salary increases for staff and workers at the British Merchant Tram Company. In the past, when the basic salary for staff was adjusted from thirty yuan to forty yuan, the workers went on strike for five days. After mediation by the Social Affairs Bureau, an agreement was reached that staff and workers should be treated equally, and future year-end salary increases should be based on the basic salary, eliminating the distinction between staff and workers. This regulation may seem slightly disadvantageous to the staff, but previously, staff salary increases required nomination by department heads, and not everyone was guaranteed an increase. Now, all staff members who have not committed any misconduct can receive a general increase. The current staff request to revert to the 1938 method only considers the disadvantages and not the advantages. The workers do not sympathize with the staff's position. Moreover, all six major public utilities uniformly use basic salary as the standard for year-end salary increases. I have yet to find a convincing reason to persuade the company to yield. If the labor and management cannot reach an agreement, the Social Affairs Bureau will issue a ruling according to the law."</p>
<h3>Three Securities Firms Punished for Violations</h3>

<h3>Elderly Woman Dies on Train - Railway Bureau Police Department Accused</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Wang Zucai yesterday filed a complaint, stating that his sister, Yu Wangshi's, death was due to the negligence of the Jinghu (Beijing-Shanghai) Railway North Station police officers, leading to a wrongful death. He requested the court to investigate. The complaint stated that Yu Wangshi, age 73, boarded Train No. 57 from Beijing to Shanghai on the night of the 10th of this month. While on the train, she vomited and lost consciousness. A fellow passenger surnamed Hua, who was from the same hometown, reported it to the railway police for assistance after arriving in Shanghai. The railway police ordered a "red hat" to drag her off the train and abandon her. It was raining at the time, and she was exposed to the rain, which weakened her further, and she collapsed to the ground. Although the railway bureau sent her to the railway hospital for treatment, she died. After hearing the news, Wang Hengcai not only reported it to the district attorney's office to conduct an autopsy and arrange for the funeral but also filed a complaint with the district attorney's office requesting an investigation and legal action.</p>

<h3>Commander Fu Zhengmo Returns from Inspecting Two Regiment Jurisdictions - Satisfied with Conscription in Various Counties - Determined to Severely Punish Active Draft Dodgers</h3>
<p>Lieutenant General Fu Zhengmo, commander of the Shanghai Garrison District, inspected conscription work in Changshu, Wuxian, Wujiang, and Songjiang counties under the jurisdiction of the Wuxian Regiment District, and Kunshan and Taicang counties under the jurisdiction of the Songjiang Regiment District. He departed from Shanghai by car on the morning of the 17th at 9:00 AM, accompanied by Zhou Yuqun, chief of the Conscription Section, and Ge Jianxun, director of military medicine. A Central News Agency reporter accompanied them for the inspection. After three days, he returned to Shanghai at 4:00 PM yesterday afternoon. Mr. Fu visited each county, questioning officials closely. He paid close attention to the equipment of the conscription stations, the care of new recruits, and the techniques of conscription, providing guidance and corrections to conscription officials at all levels. He was generally satisfied with the conscription work in each county, but still found some significant shortcomings that need to be addressed quickly. This is of great importance to the future of conscription and military operations to suppress the rebellion.</p>
<p>The Wuxian Regiment District's quota for this year is over 8,000 recruits, of which Changshu has a quota of over 3,100, and so far, over 1,500 have been conscripted. Wuxian has a quota of over 3,700, and one-third have been conscripted. Wujiang has a quota of over 1,400, and over 700 have been conscripted. The Kunshan county of the Songjiang Regiment District has a quota of over 900, and 470 have been conscripted. Taicang has a quota of over 1,000, and over 600 have been conscripted. According to officials from each county, all conscriptions can be completed before the end of April this year.</p>
<p>Family Allowance for New Recruits - Up to 30 Dan of White Rice</p>
<p>The amount of the family allowance for new recruits varies depending on the financial resources of each county and township. In general, it can be described as generous, with the highest amount reaching 30 dan of white rice, equivalent to approximately 100 million yuan in cash. The lowest amount is also around 15 dan of white rice. Due to the large amount of family allowances (i.e., white rice) being raised, rice from the countryside has been pouring into urban areas, causing rice prices to fall in recent days.</p>
<p>During the reporter's visit to the various counties with Mr. Fu, the most noteworthy problem discovered was that county-level officials responsible for promoting conscription were not effectively carrying out their duties, and conscription publicity was also lacking. Local public opinion organs still harbor a mentality of perfunctoriness. It is estimated that among the new recruits already conscripted in each county, more than 70% are so-called "volunteers," and the abuses of "volunteers" are therefore unavoidable. The major issues include: (1) Draft dodgers are rampant, creating a situation where there are almost no volunteers without draft dodgers. (2) Active-duty soldiers enlist as volunteers, setting up scams to obtain large family allowances and then attempting to desert. (3) Those who are purely from the fields are mostly overage or do not meet the physical requirements. (4) Communist bandits may have infiltrated the ranks of volunteers to undermine our conscription and conduct counter-propaganda, but so far, none have been discovered.</p>
<p>Enjoying Equal Treatment - Revealing a Look of Joy</p>
<p>Commander Fu has already provided recommendations to the Ministry of National Defense regarding the issue of draft dodgers. Once a draft dodger is caught, if their age and physical condition are suitable for military service, they will be unconditionally ordered to serve in the military, without receiving a family allowance, and their term of service will be extended indefinitely as a form of punishment and to deter others from following suit. If their age and physical condition are not suitable for military service, they will be sent to court for strict punishment. Mr. Fu has also ordered officials at all levels of conscription to thoroughly investigate the origins of volunteers, whether they have national identity cards, or leave passes, etc., to prevent the infiltration of spies and the desertion of new recruits. Those who carry their family allowances with them must be registered and carefully managed. Mr. Fu has convened new recruits several times to give speeches, explaining the meaning of military service and the current tasks, and he has also warned all management personnel to treat new recruits as their own children and to show them affection. According to the reporter's observations, the new recruits were still somewhat fearful when they were at the county conscription stations, but after being received by the new recruit brigade, they fully enjoyed the treatment of regular soldiers, and their state of mind immediately improved.</p>
<p>No Shortage of Good Stories in Conscription - Just Need a Fountain Pen</p>
<p>Among the conscription stations in each county, Kunshan's facilities are better, followed by Changshu and Taicang, and Wuxian and Wujiang are the worst. Commander Fu has separately convened the county magistrates, speakers of the county councils, and party secretaries to discuss improvements, with the minimum standard being "enough to eat and enough to sleep."</p>
<p>There are no shortage of good stories in the conscription process that are worth writing about. For example, Wu Yongsheng, a new recruit from Changshu, did not accept a family allowance and only wanted a fountain pen. Wang Dayong, a new recruit from Wujiang, used ten shi of the 25 shi of rice from his family allowance to pay for his father's funeral expenses, and the remaining 15 shi for his brothers' education. Shen Kanghuai and Huang Junyuan, heads of Taicang County, were the first to conscript their younger brothers, Shen Jinbao and Huang Wukui. The City God Temples in Suzhou and Wujiang counties have seen a surge in incense offerings in recent days, as new recruits and their families burn incense and pray for a safe journey and an early triumphant return. It is also reported that Commander Fu will travel to Jinshan, Songjiang, and Fengxian counties under the jurisdiction of the Songjiang Regiment District within days to continue his inspection of conscription work.</p>

<h3>Armored Strong Force is Growing</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Xuzhou 16th dispatch] On the 5th of this month, a reporters group had the rare opportunity to visit the First Tank Regiment under the leadership of Chiang Wei-kuo. This regiment is currently the most powerful unit in our country's armored forces. Its tanks are dispersed into smaller units, operating on various battlefields in East China. The soldiers of the First Regiment excitedly told reporters: They were especially happy that visitors came in March, because it brought back glorious historical memories. It turns out that on March 3, 1944, the Expeditionary Force's tank battalion attacked the Japanese army in Waluban from the India-Burma border. By March 8, they had completely defeated the renowned elite Japanese 18th Division. From that time on, American allies began to believe that the Chinese were qualified to drive tanks and could demonstrate their effectiveness on the battlefield. At that time, Battalion Deputy Commander Zhao Zhihua of the tank battalion is now the Deputy Commander of the First Regiment, using his rich experience to assist Commander Chiang Wei-kuo in leading this new force.</p>
<p>Impression of Chiang Wei-kuo</p>
<p>The impression Commander Chiang Wei-kuo gave us was: young, intelligent, and full of energy in his speech and actions. From the expressions of his conversations with his subordinates, it could be seen that the relationship between officers and subordinates was quite harmonious. He treated us very courteously, saying that except for certain departments, we were free to visit or photograph the rest, but some situations were related to national defense, and he hoped we would not publish them. We met successively with the battalion and company commanders, who led us to visit the various units such as armored vehicles, tanks, and repair shops. The existing tanks were all those that entered the country victoriously from the India-Burma battlefield during the War of Resistance. The Japanese tanks received after the victory were equal to scrap iron due to their deliberate destruction. The American tanks we use can only be considered light tanks by world standards, but they have exerted great power in the military suppression of the rebellion. Some armored vehicles were converted from military trucks. In these areas, it shows that the Chinese people are quite creative. According to the staff, they do not feel a lack of oil and ammunition, but machine parts are indeed in great need of external supply. This is the result of the failure of Secretary of State Marshall's mission to China and the suspension of military aid to China. I told them at the time that this situation would not last too long, because the United States ordered the shipment of military supplies to China starting on March 4th of this year, and the first batch of 2,000 tons was already on its way.</p>
<p>Officers of the Tank Battalion</p>
<p>This is truly a force equipped with American equipment, from weapons to clothing. Even in the enthusiasm of the staff, there is a bit of an American feel. Mechanics wearing work clothes covered in oil climbed in and out from under the armored vehicles, without being sloppy. Their treatment is also quite good, much higher than that of ordinary army soldiers. Everything in the regiment is arranged in an orderly manner, indicating that this is an efficiency-oriented group.</p>
<p>Several officers in the tank battalion have just returned from the front lines of Eastern Henan. They have fought in Shandong and Henan, and have a lot of practical economic experience in suppressing the rebellion. They said that the tanks are usually assigned to certain divisions and commanded by their division commanders. They are not used lightly unless they encounter a major enemy or hear of the annihilation of bandit troops. Every time they are dispatched, they always have considerable gains. Except for a defeat in Southern Shandong last winter, there is very little damage.</p>
<p>Bandit Troops Lack Weapons</p>
<p>The bandit troops currently do not have enough weapons to attack tanks, and they cannot find technicians who can operate tanks. In one battle, a tank of the National Army was deeply mired in the mud of the riverbank and had to be abandoned. After the bandit troops found it, they used several cows to pull it, but they couldn't move it, and finally they left it alone and left. The bandit troops often use dismemberment tortures on soldiers of the National Army's special forces and famous combat units that are captured, which is truly inhuman. Since the autumn of last year, the bandit troops' policy on prisoners of war has been somewhat revised, and they often release batches of captured officers and soldiers of the National Army, wanting to use the temporary psychological aberrations of these people to disintegrate the National Army's morale and fighting will. They deliberately treat them favorably during their period of detention. However, they still kill many pilots and special forces soldiers. As for party and government personnel, they and their families are all targets of persecution.</p>
<p>Another commander of the tank unit witnessed how the bandit troops handled their own wounded soldiers. He said: They do their best to ensure that no wounded soldiers of their own are left on the battlefield. The lightly wounded mobilize a large number of civilians to carry them away and take care of them so that they can return to the battlefield as soon as possible. If they are seriously injured, they do not have enough medical equipment and do not want their troops to see them, so they are often secretly transferred collectively. On the tombstones on the ground, one person's name is used, but underneath is a mass grave of thousands of people!</p>
<p>Expressing Optimism About the Future</p>
<p>Chiang Wei-kuo had a pleasant conversation with the reporter group for more than an hour. He answered and evaded many of the questions raised very appropriately. He said: He usually likes to read books on radio and machinery in his spare time, because radio communication and armored units are too closely related. At the same time, in this era, to lead people, you must rely on your own knowledge and skills. Qualifications and age cannot suppress people. Regarding the future of the Chinese armored forces, he believes that the government's establishment of the Armored Corps Command indicates a long-term plan, so he is very optimistic. In particular, the appointment of General Xu Tingyao as commander is an even more brilliant action by the government. He found it difficult to answer many big questions, and finally made it clear that "don't test him," and everyone laughed it off. We are willing to express our respect for such a young military man with unparalleled support who is willing to run to the front lines of Xuzhou to work hard.</p>
<p>Visiting the Armored Corps School</p>
<p>After leaving the First Tank Regiment, the reporter group specially visited the Armored Corps School, which trains drivers for armored units. After President Hu Xianqun's orderly explanation of each item, a conceptual outline was formed. What is worth mentioning is the scientific nature of the training methods, which fully utilize charts, models, and educational films. Every complex principle is broken down into very simple actions. A person with normal intelligence can easily learn all the courses in a short period of time. President Hu said: "The Americans call this method 'the fool can learn it method'. However, before we are trained, we first have a 'mechanical mind' test, using scientific instruments to calculate the learning ability of each person. If the intelligence is too low, they will not be admitted. Now everything focuses on efficiency, so our training methods, although they make it 'easy for fools to learn', we don't want real fools."

<h3>Suspected Death of Sheng Meizhen - Re-examination Confirms Suicide by Hanging</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Wujin 19th Dispatch] Sheng Meizhen of Dongyao Village, Hekou Township, died suddenly and violently. Her mother-in-law and aunt were evasive, and everyone said she had been strangled. After two careful re-examinations by the district attorney's office, an examination was conducted according to law, lasting more than three hours. The rope marks on her neck were clear, and it was determined that she had died by hanging herself. The family members on both sides had no further objections, and funeral arrangements were made.</p>
<p>(Another dispatch) After Sheng Meizhen's violent death, the court's district attorney's office conducted two examinations, and the reports all concluded that she had died by hanging herself. However, Sheng Meizhen's father, Rongsheng, presented reasoned counter-evidence, believing that she had been strangled. (1) The dust on the beam where she was hanging was undisturbed, with no traces at all. (2) The rope provided by the Lu family was a cloth waistband only three feet long, which could not possibly wrap around her neck and be used to hang her. (3) There were obvious rope marks on the front, back, and all around the corpse's neck, proving that she had been strangled. (4) The examiner was seen whispering with the Lu family during the work, indicating bribery. On the 18th, Sheng Rongsheng came to the city to petition the council, requesting further redress. He also published an advertisement, strongly refuting the district attorney's office's inaccurate examination. The dispute is unfolding.</p>
<h3>A Young Man from Taixian Attempts to Evade Military Service - Cuts Off Three Fingers</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Taixing 16th Dispatch] Yesterday, a tragic incident occurred in a hotel in the county town in which a man cut off three fingers with a knife to avoid military service. It is said that Zhang Xinfu, a young man from Kongye Township in the Fourth District, had recently arrived in Taixing with a batch of young men from the Fourth District and was temporarily staying at the hotel. Yesterday morning, he suddenly asked the tea room for a kitchen knife and cut off three fingers of his left hand, causing a bloody mess. The district personnel immediately sent him to the military service office for examination, but because he had lost too much blood, the county government sent him to the hospital for treatment. After he recovers, in addition to being punished according to law, he will still be sent to military service as a warning to those who try to evade military service in the future.</p>
<h3>Zhejiang Province Coordinates Construction Year Decides to Supervise by District and Industry</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Hangzhou 19th Dispatch] This year is Zhejiang Province's Construction Year. In order to enhance work efficiency, the provincial government, led by the Director of Construction Department, Pi Zuoqiong, will implement a district division, including six districts: Hangzhou, Jiaxing-Huzhou, Yanzhou-Jinhua, Quzhou, Ningbo-Shaoxing, and Wenzhou-Lishui; and implement an industry division, including agriculture, water conservancy, transportation, and special products. The government will begin rural supervision next month.</p>
<h3>Problem with Public Grain - Japonica Rice Becomes Indica Rice - Changzhou Council Questions the Department of Agriculture and Food</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Wujin 18th Dispatch] The agenda of the county council on the afternoon of the 17th was the work of the Department of Agriculture and Food. As soon as Deputy Director Ding gave an oral report, council members began to question him harshly. They asked in depth about transportation costs, payment of japonica and indica rice, the difference in prices between passenger rice, and how the surplus rice from processing was handled. Deputy Director Ding found it difficult to answer, and the scene was very awkward. Council Member Zou Xigeng recounted the case of a good citizen being killed by a dereliction of duty by a grain official, speaking with passion and tears. It is said that a villager from Wangxia Village carried a stone of grain to Benniu to pay taxes. The office said that it had to be sent to the city. The villager followed the instructions and sent it to Zhengcheng Rice Mill outside the West Gate of the city. Because it was after office hours, the staff refused to accept it. The villager had no relatives or friends to stay with in the city, and he did not bring any money with him, so he had to curl up in a corner outside the Zhengcheng factory wall overnight. The next day, he finally paid the grain at nine o'clock, running home on an empty stomach. It was in the middle of winter, and on that day, he suffered hardship, cold, hunger, and fatigue. He was greatly harmed, fell ill when he got home, and died on the third day. He left behind his wife and children, which was tragic. At that time, for fear of affecting the grain policy, it was kept secret and not reported in the newspapers. Public sentiment was angry, because the villagers had to pay the grain in kind, the regulations were strict, the procedures were complicated, and the japonica rice had to be like pearls, but in the blink of an eye, the public grain distributed was indica rice mixed with weeds and mud. The value differed by 60,000 to 70,000 yuan per stone. The difference in more than 200,000 stones of grain was staggering, and everyone felt unfair. The questioning lasted for three hours and was not yet finished. In addition to verbal accusations, the council members also submitted written questions. In the afternoon of the 18th, the discussion of proposals still included the Department of Agriculture and Food's continued report, and they would not let up. All council members believed that the current grain policy had many continuing malpractices, and the villagers were suffering greatly. In order to address the facts and implement the council's mission of promoting and reforming, they decided to form an investigation committee to conduct a thorough investigation and to study appropriate methods with their best efforts.</p>
<h3>Gansu Province Budget Cut, Totaling Over 200 Billion</h3>
<p>[Our Lanzhou Dispatch, 18th] Gansu Province's budget for the first half of the year was originally over 400 billion. However, due to the central government only approving a subsidy of 64.4 billion, the provincial government re-prepared the budget, tightening up on project expenditures as much as possible. Except for continuing and necessary construction projects, all others were temporarily suspended. Even regular operating expenses were reduced as much as possible. The total amount after the budget cut is over 210 billion.

<h3>Today's Postal Service</h3>
<p>— Li Jinlu</p>
<p>Written to commemorate the 52nd anniversary of the establishment of the postal service.</p>
<p>Our country's postal service originated from the postal transmission system. As early as the Zhou dynasty, there were postal transmission orders. Later, the Qin dynasty built roads in all directions, and postal routes reached everywhere. Since the Han and Tang dynasties, post stations flourished. The Yuan dynasty, with its powerful military force, extended the station system to far-reaching areas. Up until the Ming and Qing dynasties, there were reforms in each era. The formal establishment of the national postal service began sixteen years before the founding of the Republic of China and has now been in operation for fifty-two years.</p>
<p>In ancient times, postal services were only for the use of the wealthy and the military, limited to delivering official documents. Today, the main purpose is to serve the public. No matter who or where, the postal service is there to serve them. Since the restoration of postal services, the country has been in constant turmoil, and transportation has been obstructed. Under such unstable circumstances, postal construction is naturally not easy. Fortunately, the postal service has a tradition of hard work, so even with numerous difficulties, it can still work together and strive for progress under the leadership of the transportation authorities.</p>
<p>Starting in the winter of the 36th year, Minister Yu successively established four major principles for improving postal services and implemented various new measures to achieve them. The major ones are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Speed: Utilize air transportation of mail as much as possible, establish mobile post offices such as trains, ships, and automobiles, expand postal automobile routes, improve delivery methods, and simplify mail processing operations;</p>
<p>(2) Universality: Increase various types of postal agencies, expand postal routes, develop postal services in border areas, improve rural postal delivery, and set up model post offices, overnight post offices, and holiday post offices;</p>
<p>(3) Safety: Pay attention to protecting mail, work hard to eliminate dead letters, create registered mail and insured mail, and expand air insured mail;</p>
<p>(4) Service: Establish public service agencies to build relationships between the postal service and the public, so that the opinions and requirements of the public regarding the postal service can be understood and accepted at any time, and criticism and suggestions can be used as guidelines for postal service improvements.</p>
<p>The basic spirit of these four major principles is to respect public opinion and be willing to self-reflect in order to improve operations at any time. It is believed that with the full development of this spirit, thinking of the public in every way, and making the postal service a public enterprise, the postal service will naturally reach a perfect state. In the past year, these efforts have yielded some results.</p>
<p>The most difficult things for the postal service today are that transportation is obstructed, making it impossible to fully exert its functions and seek progress, and that economic income and expenditure cannot be balanced. With the current rapid rise in prices, postal rates cannot be adjusted in time. The postal service uses limited income to cope with unlimited expenses, which is a difficult situation to remedy. Therefore, it is cutting manpower, lengthening working hours, saving all expenses, and working hard to expand operations in order to ensure that the postal service, which has been painstakingly created for more than fifty years, can continue to improve and develop universally so that the public can fully enjoy satisfactory postal services. Fortunately, people from all walks of life are coming forward to teach it.</p>

<h3>76 American Colleges and Universities Offer Chinese Culture Courses, Number of Chinese Lecturers Being Hired Is Increasing</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 19th] The Ministry of Education's investigation of foreign education has received reports that 76 universities and colleges in the United States offer Chinese culture courses, distributed in 29 states (including Hawaii). The total number of courses offered is 327, including 80 in language, 34 in art, 150 in history and culture, 26 in politics, and 37 in other courses. Before World War II, it was generally believed in the United States that Chinese language and literature were extremely difficult to learn; during the war, the US government and several universities changed their views after experimentation. They have improved their foreign language teaching techniques, especially for Chinese, which can overcome difficulties in a short period. As a result, the number of Chinese language and culture courses is increasing. The number of Chinese lecturers being hired is also increasing.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Education Re-Instructs Provincial Education Departments to Restore Education Bureaus as Soon as Possible</h3>

Those who have already established bureaus in the previous year should make every effort to increase the number of bureaus. As for counties that are unable to establish bureaus for the time being, they should also expand the number of personnel specializing in educational administration and improve their organization in accordance with regulations to facilitate the advancement of local education.

<h3>Ministry of Education Cables All Provinces and Cities to Expand Female Teacher Education</h3>
<p>Graduates Should Be Hired First</p>
<p>[Dahua News Agency] The Ministry of Education believes that popularizing education is a crucial task that the entire country has unanimously recognized as urgent. Training teachers is a prerequisite for popularizing education. In practice, women are more suitable for engaging in education. In times when educational compensation is meager and life is extremely difficult, women bear a lighter burden and may be content in their positions. Even if they no longer continue in schools after marriage, they can use what they have learned to raise their children, which is also beneficial to the family. Therefore, expanding female normal education and encouraging women to engage in education to increase the source of teachers is beneficial to both school education and family education. To this end, the Ministry of Education has formulated measures to expand female normal education, encourage women to engage in education for life, and has cabled all provincial and municipal education departments to pay close attention to promotion, noting two points that should be noted: (1) Local education finance agencies in various places should set up female normal schools according to the needs of normal schools, and select outstanding female students from elementary and junior high school graduates and encourage them to study. (2) Local education administrative agencies in various places should provide vocational protection and rewards for graduates of female normal schools, and should give priority to hiring them.</p>

<h3>In Memory of Liu Zhan'en</h3>
<p>— Lu Shixiong</p>
<p>In modern higher education, degrees serve as milestones, progressing from bachelor's to master's to doctorate. While learning is said to be endless, attaining a doctorate represents the pinnacle of academic achievement, beyond which there is nothing further to add.</p>
<p>Having academic knowledge does not necessarily equate to having integrity. It's even possible that a person with knowledge may become blinded by profit and betray their nation. Looking at the collaborators during the Anti-Japanese War, it's evident that some held doctoral degrees; figures like Chu Minyi and Zhang Sumin exemplify this.</p>
<p>Mr. Liu Zhan'en was a doctor during his lifetime. By sacrificing his life for his country, he became a martyr forever remembered in history. The former highlights the peak of his knowledge, while the latter emphasizes his loyalty and integrity. As an educator embodying both "士" (scholar/gentleman and martyr), he is truly worthy of being a "role model for all ages."</p>
<p>While in Japan, Dr. Liu often likened his role to "gasoline" (汽油) within the educated class, believing gasoline to be the primary driving force in machinery and an essential component in industry. It provides light and cleanses impurities, yet ultimately burns or evaporates itself. Dr. Liu's self-comparison reveals that his sacrifice for the nation and his willingness to die for righteousness were consistent with his long-held aspirations.</p>
<p>It's remembered that the Japanese puppet regime, hating Dr. Liu's anti-Japanese speeches, prompted Wen Zongyao to threaten him, saying, "Hmm, be careful, please avoid the limelight!" However, Dr. Liu refused to seek "prudent self-preservation" by changing his course. He continued his efforts, even one day substituting for an absent English teacher in the middle school, teaching an English lesson on anti-Japanese themes. His strong and passionate patriotism had long placed his personal life beyond consideration.</p>
<p>The authorities of Shanghai University and its alumni association, commemorating the tenth anniversary of the death of former President Liu on April 7th of this year, felt compelled to honor this exceptional figure. They initiated a 30 billion yuan fundraising campaign to expand the existing library, renaming it the "Zhan'en Library." It is said that two female alumni, whose marriages were officiated by Dr. Liu, are now widows and donated hundreds of millions of yuan each, both to commemorate former President Liu and to honor the memory of their husbands.</p>
<p>In conclusion, education is for cultivating talent for the nation. If talent is used to appease the enemy, it's better to be without talent. Therefore, becoming a traitor after obtaining a doctorate betrays the country's benevolence in nurturing talent. Dr. Liu's legacy is not merely a model for the teachers and students of Shanghai University in a narrow sense, but can be broadly extended to serve as an example for the entire nation.</p>

<h3>Suspicion of Small Loans in the Money Industry, Business Operations Must Be Profitable</h3>
<p>[This newspaper] The small-amount credit loan syndicate jointly formed by Shanghai money shops started lending on February 3rd, and the business is going smoothly. Now, this reporter learned from the syndicate that from February 3rd to the 17th of this month, a total of 170 applications were received, of which 95 were approved, 71 were disapproved, and 4 were still under investigation and review.

(2) Increase the loan amount to 9 million yuan per household to meet the actual needs of small industrial and commercial businesses.</p>
<h3>Factory Silk and Silk Fabrics All Rise, Rayon Similar to the Previous Day</h3>
<p>The rayon market was high in the morning and weak in the afternoon yesterday. As a result, the price was similar to the previous day. No. 120, Xu Zi Youguang, opened at 221 million yuan in the morning, once dropped to 17 million yuan, and then rose again. The noon closed as high as 30 million yuan for the spot price. The afternoon opened with transactions at 31 million yuan, and then fell back to a closing sale price of 25 million yuan. Sinia No. 3 Youguang was in the range of 200 to 300 million yuan.</p>
<p>Factory Silk Yesterday, the market rose sharply, and all levels of five-dan goods had no transactions. The C-grade was priced at around 335 million yuan in the afternoon. High-quality another-dan goods, Robinson, Ganxun, etc., were priced at 320 million yuan in the morning, and the asking price was raised to 30 million yuan in the afternoon. The price of high-quality another-dan dried silk was around 270 million yuan.</p>
<p>Silk Fabric Yesterday, the market rose sharply. Huaqiang Zhensi quilt covers opened at 111.7 million yuan, and the market gradually rose due to strong buying interest. The maximum price was 18 million yuan outside the customs, and the spot price closed at 17.5 million yuan. Gete Biku Daheng sheets closed at 440,000 yuan. The factory prices of other silk goods were raised by about 10%, and the rayon goods all stood firm.</p>
<h3>Light-Colored Woolen Fabrics Dominate</h3>
<p>Due to seasonal factors, light-colored light gray woolen fabrics and serge are dominant. Buyers need light colors first, resulting in light-colored woolen fabrics continuing to be popular, and the market is much higher than dark colors. The price difference between goods of the same quality, solely due to color, can be as high as 200,000 to 300,000 yuan per yard, which is not uncommon. The markets for other woolen fabrics have very few special ups and downs, and there are few actual transactions. Although the US dollar exchange rate has been adjusted to 255,000 yuan, the market is unmoved because the high interest rate is generally tightening the capital, weakening actual sales. In addition, a large number of rayon, cotton, Japanese goods, and woolen fabrics have been distributed, and buyers are afraid to import goods with high interest rates. However, the principle that one yard of Zhanghua flannel can be exchanged for one load of white rice has now been exceeded, which is also a major factor, and there are signs of thinking about danger at high altitudes.</p>
<h3>The National Economic Council Passes Chemical Raw Material Resolution: If Domestic Production Can Meet Demand, All Imports Will Be Banned</h3>
<p>According to Mr. Chen Mousheng, who participated in the National Economic Council's discussion on chemical quotas, the variety of chemical raw materials is complex, making quota allocation extremely difficult. In the past, the Import Control Committee allocated these quotas based on customs statistics from 1947. However, since the war, some chemical raw materials can now be produced domestically, eliminating the need for further imports. To address this, the National Economic Council convened a meeting in Beijing on the 17th with the National Federation of Industries, the Import Control Committee, the Central Bureau of Standards, the Central Testing Laboratory, and the Ministry of Economic Affairs to discuss the matter. Based on the opinions submitted by the Industrial Subsidy Department of the National Federation of Industries, the following three principles were adopted:</p>
<p>(1) Raw materials and products that can be produced domestically in sufficient quantities will be absolutely and completely banned from import.</p>
<p>(2) Raw materials and products that cannot be produced domestically but are genuinely needed will have import quotas relaxed according to actual needs.</p>
<p>(3) The import of chemical raw materials and products that are insufficiently produced domestically will be restricted based on careful consideration of the situation. To ensure thorough deliberation, the council has scheduled another meeting in Beijing on Wednesday with relevant departments to make a final decision.</p>
<h3>Market Demand Appears Active: Rice Prices Continue to Rise, Edible Oil Shows a Particularly Sharp Increase</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] Yesterday, due to the rise in prices of all commodities and high production costs, rice merchants were confident, and demand appeared somewhat active. Prices in the southern market rose by over 100,000 yuan per grade, and in the northern market, prices initially rose by 200,000 yuan, then increased by another 50,000 yuan at closing.</p>
<p>Yesterday's registered arrivals were 3,116 shi in the southern market and 5,043 shi in the northern market. Special japonica rice was priced at 3.8 million yuan in the southern market and 3.9 million yuan in the northern market. White japonica rice was 3.605 million yuan in the southern market and 3.8 million yuan in the northern market. Thin indica rice was 3.605 million yuan in both markets, and early rice was 3.5 million yuan. White round-grain rice was 3.705 million yuan in the southern market and 3.7 million yuan in the northern market. Yangxian rice was 3.6 million yuan in the southern market and 3.7 million yuan in the northern market.</p>
<p>Flour: Followed the rise in rice prices, and its increase was even stronger than the previous day. Because prices in Suzhou and Wuxi were high, and wheat prices also reached 2.2 million yuan, all types of flour rose by 40,000 to 60,000 yuan. "Warship" and "Old Car" brands were heavily traded at 1.5 million yuan, while "Jiancheng" and "Red Bee" brands saw considerable activity. Various unbranded flours were in high demand. Wheat bran rose by 20,000 to 30,000 yuan, and wheat opened at 2.2 million yuan.</p>
<p>Grains: Generally continued to rise. Due to the rise in rice prices, merchants became more confident, and asking prices increased accordingly. Hankou green beans rose by 50,000 to 60,000 yuan. Qingdao buyers showed little interest in corn, and transportation from Yantai was inconvenient, limiting purchases. Thus, the price lacked momentum for increase, remaining at yesterday's level. Red sorghum rose slightly, while broad beans and selected green beans increased marginally. Sesame showed a slight uptick, and raw peanuts continued to rise by 200,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Edible Oil: Continued to soar. Raw oil showed a particularly sharp increase, mainly due to limited supplies and difficulties in procuring new shipments, causing sellers to aggressively raise prices. Qingdao and Jiangbei Ji-brand raw oil both approached the 9 million yuan mark, jumping by 400,000 yuan. Although oil factories released supplies of soybean oil, demand remained high, leading to an increase of 230,000 yuan. Raw sesame oil rose by 300,000 yuan, while refined oil and rapeseed oil each rose by 200,000 yuan. Soybean cakes were sought by Shantou and Taiwanese buyers, as well as individual consumers, making the market very brisk, with prices rising by 40,000 to 50,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>American Rice Arrives Continuously</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] The President Company's "Arcadia Victory" (transliteration) arrived in Shanghai from San Francisco the day before yesterday, carrying 21,988 bags of rice, each weighing 100 pounds. It is currently docked at the China Merchants Bureau's northern docks for unloading. Reportedly, a large quantity is en route to Shanghai.</p>
<h3>Preparatory Meeting Held for National Flour Industry Conference</h3>

Registration began at 8:00 a.m. today, and a preparatory meeting will be held this afternoon to discuss proposal grouping and the selection of presidium candidates. At 7:00 p.m. this evening, a reception will be held for newspaper reporters at the Hong Kong Road Bankers Club. More than sixty representatives from all over the country are attending the conference, and they are already en route.</p>
<h3>China Trust Bureau Purchases Tung Oil: Tung Oil Industry Provides Opinions</h3>
<p>To support the China Trust Bureau's policy of resuming tung oil purchases from the 15th of this month to promote exports, the Plant Oil Export Association held a meeting at noon on the 19th to provide suggestions for the bureau's consideration. The summarized opinions are as follows: 1. The current market price of tung oil in Wuzhou and Guangzhou, near smuggling areas, is 5.77 million yuan (Guangzhou) and 6.2 million yuan (Wuzhou) per picul, similar to Shanghai. There seems to be no need to increase the Shanghai price. 2. To stabilize inland oil prices during this period of foreign exchange fluctuation and market chaos, it is best to observe and wait, minimizing transactions to avoid market volatility. Increasing purchase prices at this time could easily trigger fluctuations in tung oil prices in producing areas, increasing difficulties in inland procurement. 3. The current ratio of inland tung oil prices to rice prices is considered reasonable, so there is no need for immediate change. 4. If purchase prices are increased following foreign exchange adjustments, it would encourage tung oil prices, which will not sufficiently increase exports. Such operation will never be regularized. It is therefore advisable to consider the situation carefully and refrain from raising prices for the time being.</p>
<h3>Statistics on Silk and Silk Fabric Exports Last Year</h3>

<h3>Cigarettes: Firm at First, Then Weak</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the cigarette market opened firmly due to active short covering and some new buying activity. "Ten Great Britain" brands were bid up to 100.2 to 100.3 million yuan with some transactions. Subsequently, as individual sellers took profits at high prices, Nanyang Brothers Tobacco Company introduced "Bank" and "Dalianzhu" cigarettes. At the same time, remittances from other cities were frequent, and sales increased, causing the market to turn bearish. As a result, "Ten Great Britain" brands fell back to 98.2 million yuan, down 300,000 yuan from the previous day. "Old Knife" brands rose by 400,000 yuan due to healthy demand. Other domestic and foreign cigarette brands generally experienced more declines than gains.</p>
<h3>Anticipation of Further Gains Drives Customer Demand: Yarn Prices Reach New Peaks, Cotton Cloth Inventory Depleted, Prices Rise Sharply</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the cotton yarn market was bullish as customers continued to anticipate further gains. Buyers from Tianjin, Hankou, Guangdong, and other regions remained active, while local merchants and manufacturers eagerly sought to accumulate inventory, leading to new high prices.</p>
<p>42-count Blue Phoenix fine yarn jumped by 5 million yuan at the open, breaking the 200 million yuan mark and reaching 210 million yuan with some purchases. 21-count Double Horse brand yarn opened at 118 million yuan. The Yarn Control Bureau suddenly issued a notice accepting applications from industry members. However, with strong bullish sentiment, there was little inclination to sell. By closing, only 42-count Blue Phoenix and Jincheng yarns saw slight declines, with Blue Phoenix at 200.5 million yuan and Jincheng at 200.3 million yuan, continuing to rise by 10 million yuan and 11.2 to 11.3 million yuan, respectively, from the previous day.</p>
<p>40-count and 32-count yarns also continued to rise by 9 million to 15.6 million yuan. 21-count Double Horse brand yarn for immediate delivery rose by another 7 million to 8 million yuan. 20-count, 16-count, and 10-count yarns generally rose by another 5 million to 14.5 million yuan, closing at high prices.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the cotton cloth market opened with active buying as news spread that a certain cloth merchant had released 700 to 800 bolts of Dragon Head fine cloth, prompting short covering. It was also reported that the Hong Kong exchange rate had fallen sharply, yarn prices had soared, and customer demand was strong. Furthermore, spinning quotas were becoming scarce. The previous day, each household was only allowed to purchase 20 bolts of Silver Moon fine cloth, and only after waiting in line. Market inventory was depleted, and prices rose sharply across the board.</p>

<p>Literature and History</p>
<h3>The Character [] in Oracle Bone Inscriptions</h3>
<p>— Zhou Zumo</p>
<p>Shuowen says: "虫, also named 蝮, three inches long, with a head as big as a thumb." Tang Yun pronounces it "xu wei fan." It also says: "它, also a 虫. It lengthens from 虫, representing the shape of a coiled tail. In ancient times, people living in caves feared 它, hence the greeting 'Have you encountered 它?'" Tang pronounces it "tuo he fan." These two characters have different pronunciations. However, in oracle bone inscriptions, "虫" and "它" are the same character, representing the shape of a snake or insect. The character "無齿" can be written with either "它" or "虫," and "一無　" can also be written as "無虫," which is clear evidence. Therefore, there is no doubt that 虫 is pronounced as 它. Shuowen also has the character 　, which says: "The general name for insects. Pronounced like 昆." Tang Yun pronounces it "gu hun fan." The character 　 also appears in oracle bone inscriptions. I have seen it in the following eight instances:</p>
<p>Although the writing of the character "　" in these eight oracle bone inscriptions varies slightly, comparison of the phrases shows that it is the same character, equivalent to the "　" character in Shuowen. The first to seventh instances are from sacrificial oracle bone inscriptions, where the character "　" is likely a person's name. The eighth instance is from an oracle bone inscription inquiring about harm, where the character "　" appears to be a place name. The first three instances were divined at the same time, and the fourth and fifth instances were divined at the same time. The calligraphy is from a very early period, written by diviners during the time of Wu Ding. According to Mr. Dong Yantang's "Yin Li Pu," the character 祭 is written in this way, which is precisely an early style (see Volume 3, page 13 of the upper compilation). However, the people worshiped here are all "　," unlike the former dukes and kings of Yin, because we have not seen him worshiped together with other former dukes and kings in the materials we have. Therefore, I believe that he may be "Zhong Hui" of the Book of Documents. The preface to the "Zhong Hui's Proclamation" in the Book of Documents says: "When Tang returned from Xia, he came to Da Jiong, and Zhong Hui made a proclamation." Everyone knows that Zhong Hui's Proclamation is a forgery, but Zhong Hui was definitely a real person. The "Spring and Autumn Annals of Zuo" cited Zhong Hui's words in the twelfth year of Duke Xuan and the fourteenth year of Duke Xiang. Moreover, the "Spring and Autumn Annals of Zuo" in the first year of Duke Ding says:</p>
<p>Xue Zai said: "Xi Zhong, the founding ancestor of Xue, lived in Xue and served as the chariot official of Xia. Xi Zhong moved to Pi; Zhong Hui lived in Xue and served as the left minister of Tang."</p>
<p>This is the most reliable record. Therefore, there is no doubt that Zhong Hui lived in the Shang Dynasty and was an ancestor of Xue. So the false Kong Commentary of Shangshu said: "Zhong Hui was Xiang Zuo of Shang, the descendant of Xi Zhong," which is based on the "Spring and Autumn Annals of Zuo." Since Zhong Hui was indeed a real person, then there must have been two important ministers during the time of Shang Tang, one was Yi Yin, and the other was Zhong Hui. Yi Yin's name has appeared many times in oracle bone inscriptions and is often worshiped together with Da Yi (see the first piece on page 22 of the Upper Compilation and page 151 of the Fortunate Compilation), so Zhong Hui cannot but be seen in oracle bone inscriptions. Now, from the oracle bone inscriptions mentioned above, it seems that "蚰" is "Zhong Hui."</p>
<p>However, to establish this argument, two questions must be resolved first. First, there are oracle bone inscriptions in which Yi Yin is worshiped together with Da Yi, but there are none for Zhong Hui, which seems suspicious. Second, the character 虺 is pronounced "xu gui fan" in the Shangshu Shuwen, as well as in rhyme dictionaries. The character 　, however, is pronounced "kun" in Shuowen and "gu hun fan" in Tang Yun. The two do not match, and an explanation should be sought.</p>
<p>Regarding the first question, it is difficult to provide a satisfactory answer. It requires the discovery of new materials. Although the existing materials are insufficient to address this, the fact that he can be sacrificed with a burnt offering of sheep and pigs means that he is not just a former duke or king, but a great minister of the state. The fact that 　 is not in the same rank as the former dukes and kings shows that he was an important minister of the state.</p>
<p>Regarding the second question, it seems to be the key, but it is not difficult to explain. We can discuss it in two points:</p>
<p>(1) The pronunciation of the character 虺,</p>
<p>(2) The relationship between 蚰 and 虺 in terms of sound and meaning.</p>
<p>(1) The Shuowen says that the character 虺 is derived from 虫 and the sound 元. The Shuwen pronounces this character as "xu gui fan," which does not match the sound of 元. Therefore, Xu Xuan said: "元 is not a sound, the meaning is unknown." Qing Dynasty scholar Wu Dacheng said in "Xiaoxue Shuo Wen Hui Lue":</p>
<p>"The 'Zhong Hui' in the Shangshu, the 'Annals of Yin Benji' in the Records of the Grand Historian writes it as '仲　,' and the Stone Classics write it as '仲傀,' and the 'Yao Wen' chapter in Xunzi writes it as '中簾.' Shuowen says: '傀 means great,' Erya says: 'Hong Long is ancient, its large ones are called 傀.' 傀 and 歸 both have the meaning of greatness, and since 虺 is commonly used with 傀 薛, then 虺 also has the meaning of greatness; therefore, it is derived from 兀, which is the appearance of being tall. 虫 is the sound. Thus, 　 is the greatest of the Long Gu, 傀 is the greatest of the human body, and 虺 is the greatest of the vipers. Sound and meaning can both be linked."</p>
<p>Mr. Wu's statement best captures the relationship between sound and meaning. The "Yu Pian" has already said that 虫 is an ancient form of the character 虺, which has a unique perspective. Now, from the variants of the character Zhong Hui in the Shangshu cited by Mr. Wu, 雷, 傀, and 薛 are all characters in the zhi rhyme group in ancient rhyme, then 虺 should also belong to the zhi group. Moreover, the "Guo Yu Wu Yu" says: "If you don't break the 虺, what will you do with the snake?" Here, 虺 and 摧 rhyme, and snake and 何 rhyme. 摧 is also a character in the zhi group, which is even more definitive proof that 虺 and 摧 belong to the same group. Yan Zhitui also mentioned the character "螝" in his "Family Instructions," which is also related to the character 虺. The "Family Instructions" says in the "Mian Xue" chapter:</p>
<p>"When I first read Zhuangzi and saw '螝 with two heads,' and Han Feizi's words: 'Among insects, there is the sou, with one body and two mouths, fighting for food and biting each other, eventually killing each other.' I was completely unaware of what this character meant, and asked everyone I met, but no one knew. Later, I saw in Zhang Yi's 'Ancient and Modern Character Glosses' that this was also an ancient form of the character 虺, and after years of confusion, I suddenly understood."</p>
<p>According to this, then Zhang Yi's "Ancient and Modern Character Glosses" takes the 虺 and 螝 as the same character. 魄 is derived from the sound 鬼, and belongs to the zhi group. Thus, it can be further determined that the ancient sound of the character 虺 must have belonged to the zhi group.</p>
<p>(2) Now that we know that the ancient sound of the character 虺 belongs to the zhi group, then the transmitted pronunciation of "xu gui yi xi," is naturally correct. However, the "　" character in Shuowen is pronounced "kun," and "gu hun fan" in Tang Yun, which is different from "xu gui." The case is that the ancient rhyme of the Kun character belongs to the zhun group, and the zhi and zhun groups often have a relationship of mutual transformation. The characters Kun and Hui should be mutually transformed. Because Kun is a 見 sound initial character, and the ancient sound of 虺 also belongs to the 見 sound initial. The variants of the character 虺, 傀廣韻 音公回切, 螝 音居追切, both of which are double sounds with Kun. Moreover, in the poem "What Kind of Person is It?" "To be a ghost or a 蜮," and in the "Rhapsody on the Abandoned City" in the Selections of Refined Literature, "Adding 羅虺蜮," the ghost is used interchangeably with 虺, which is evidence that the ancient character 虺 was pronounced with the 見 sound initial. In terms of rhyme, both Kun and 虺 are closed-mouth sounds. It can be said that all the sound and rhyme categories are extremely close except for the rhyme ending. As for the fact that the current sound of 虺 is xu gui fan, belonging to the 曉 sound initial, is suspicious. If we take the "軍" sound as an example, then it is all cleared. The character 軍 belongs to the 見 sound initial, and characters derived from the sound of 軍, such as 揮 暈 琿, etc., are all pronounced with the 曉 sound initial. Based on this mutual verification, there is nothing strange about the change from the 見 sound initial to the 曉 sound initial. Therefore, the difference in the pronunciation of Kun and 虺 must be due to a relationship of mutual transformation. Logically speaking, the pronunciation of the zhi group should come first, and the pronunciation of the zhun group should come later. If we look at it from the meaning of the character, the 虺 蝮 are often mentioned together by the ancients. The 虺 is the one with the big head of the snake, and the 蚰 character in the oracle bone inscriptions represents the shape of a big head. The writings in the first, second, third, sixth, and seventh pieces listed above are the most obvious. It can be said that the oracle bone character "蚰" and the "虺" used by the ancients are consistent in meaning. Looking at the "　" character in Shuowen, it says "read like Kun," which means that "　" and "昆" are ancient and modern characters. "昆" has the meaning of multitude and abundance, and the oracle bone "　" character from two insects to see its multitude, also the meaning is the corresponding.</p>
<p>From the above discussion, we can draw a conclusion, that is, the "　" character in oracle bone inscriptions is in shape the "蚰" character in Shuowen read like Kun, and in sound should be read as "虺" of Zhong Hui, "虺" was read anciently as "傀" or "螝," "昆" and "虺" are turning of the words. In this way, the second question also has a suitable explanation.</p>
<p>So I might as well boldly assume that "燎如　" of the oracle bone inscriptions is the "仲虺" of the book. However, the assumption is finally the assumption, and I hope that new materials can be added to prove it, and I dare not be sure of myself.</p>

<h3>On the Compilation of Regulations Office of the Secretariat-Chancellery during the Xining Era: A Discussion of the Xining New Policies, Part 1</h3>
<p>— Deng Guangming</p>
<p>In the third year of the Jiayou reign of Emperor Renzong of the Song Dynasty (1058 AD), Wang Anshi, having served as the Judicial Intendant of Jiangnan East Circuit, was appointed Vice Director of the Ministry of Revenue. He presented a memorial of ten thousand words, vehemently addressing the affairs of the time. The main points of his memorial can be summarized into three items:</p>
<p>First, the issue of laws and regulations. He believed that although the laws and decrees enforced by the court at the time were strict, they largely failed to align with the governance of the former kings. To emulate the governance of the former kings, one must first grasp their intentions and then revise and reform the detrimental laws of the time.</p>
<p>Second, the issue of talent cultivation. He believed that there was a severe lack of talent in the empire. This made it impossible to implement the court's decrees and even more difficult to reform the empire's detrimental laws to accord with the intentions of the former kings. Therefore, a comprehensive reform was necessary in all aspects of "teaching, nurturing, recruiting, and appointing" talent to ensure alignment with the right principles.</p>
<p>Third, the issue of finances. At the time, it was generally believed that excessive numbers of officials and soldiers led to insufficient national finances. Consequently, most people focused on reducing the number of officials and their salaries. However, Wang Anshi believed that the insufficiency of finances was due to "officials failing to adapt to the changing world and grasp its transformations" and "mismanaging finances." If they could "use the power of the empire to generate wealth for the empire and take the wealth of the empire to supply the expenses of the empire," there would be no concern about insufficient finances.</p>
<p>There was a full decade between the year Wang Anshi submitted his ten-thousand-word memorial and the years he formulated and vigorously implemented various new policies. However, the arguments made in this memorial were, in effect, the basis for his later reforms.</p>
<p>The final section of the ten-thousand-word memorial stated: "However, what I am advocating is not discussed by common custom, and today's commentators deem it impractical and stale... Whenever this is mentioned, they gather and laugh, considering it impractical." These words demonstrate Wang Anshi's contempt for the common views of the general populace. From this, we can also see that not only were Wang Anshi's views entirely consistent throughout, but his firm attitude of refusing to compromise with common views (which his opposition later vigorously promoted as "common custom is not worth worrying about") was also entirely consistent.</p>
<p>Wang Anshi believed that what the former kings diligently studied and upheld was the great ethical principles and fundamental laws. Therefore, among the three main points of the ten-thousand-word memorial cited earlier, Wang Anshi considered revising laws and regulations the most important and fundamental matter. When Wang Anshi gained the emperor's trust and began implementing his policies in the early years of the Xining reign of Emperor Shenzong of the Song Dynasty, the first two institutions established in connection with the new policies were the "Office for the Establishment of Regulations for the Three Offices" and the "Office for Review and Compilation of Regulations of the Secretariat-Chancellery." The task of the former institution was to create laws and regulations related to finance and the economy; the latter was to start from the origins of political affairs and first clearly define the powers and responsibilities of the Secretariat-Chancellery.</p>
<p>The establishment process of the Office for the Establishment of Regulations for the Three Offices can be verified from books such as the History of the Song Dynasty. However, the intention and establishment process of the "Office for Review and Compilation of Regulations of the Secretariat-Chancellery" are not detailed in the History of the Song Dynasty or the Records of Anecdotes of the Song Dynasty, and it is also missing from the lost volumes of the Continued Comprehensive Mirror for Aid in Governance. The Supplementary Collection of the Comprehensive Mirror also failed to supplement this matter. Only the Draft of the Song Statutes compiled by Xu Song preserves some historical materials about this institution in the department of official posts. Now, based on the records in the Statutes, I will briefly describe the intentions and process of establishing the "Office for Review and Compilation of Regulations of the Secretariat-Chancellery" as follows:</p>
<p>Before the reform of the official system in the third year of the Yuanfeng reign of Emperor Shenzong of the Song Dynasty (1080 AD), there were two Secretariat-Chancelleries in the central government: one was located outside the imperial city in the two cloisters, alongside the Department of State Affairs, and like the Department of State Affairs, it was nominal and lacked real power, only occupying a few official residences, with the function of "only managing documents and reviewing and verifying accounts." The other was located on the west side of the court hall in the forbidden city, also called the Hall of Political Affairs, which was where the prime ministers worked. The Secretariat-Chancellery in the forbidden city and the Privy Council jointly managed the military and civil affairs of the empire, collectively known as the Two Bureaus. The "Office for Review and Compilation of Regulations of the Secretariat-Chancellery" established in the early years of the Xining reign was aimed at the Secretariat-Chancellery in the forbidden city, not the one in the two cloisters outside the imperial city.</p>
<p>The duties of prime ministers throughout history were originally to "govern the country and administer state affairs, manage the balance of yin and yang," and they were responsible for overseeing all major plans for military affairs, civil administration, and finances. However, in the first half of the Northern Song Dynasty, not only was military power divided among the Privy Council, but the power over finance was also divided among the commissioners and vice commissioners of the Three Offices. The purpose was to prevent the abuse of power and usurpation that could arise from the prime minister having too much authority. With the prime minister's authority divided in this way, the political affairs of the Song Dynasty prime minister should have been simpler than those of prime ministers in previous dynasties. However, this was not the case.</p>
<p>Before the mid-Northern Song Dynasty, the establishment of officials and the division of duties were very different from those of previous dynasties. In terms of names, it was divided into three categories: "official rank," "position," and "assignment." The so-called "official rank" was only a title used to distinguish social classes, as stated in the Official Posts section of the History of the Song Dynasty: "Official rank is used to confer salaries and stipends, and to indicate position and rank." The so-called "position," such as "Academician of the Jixian Hall" or "Attendant-in-Waiting of the Longtu Pavilion," was specifically awarded to people with literary fame and good reputation. Neither of these titles had any practical duties. Those with the title of "Attendant-in-Waiting of the Longtu Pavilion" did not actually serve in the Longtu Pavilion; and those who attained the rank of Vice Minister or Minister of the Six Ministries, or even Assistant Minister, did not actually work in that ministry, only holding the title without performing the duties. The actual duties of these people with titles of officials in the central government and various hall and pavilion positions might be to serve as supervisors in various circuits, or to serve as chief officials of various prefectures and military garrisons. This actual duty they undertook was called "assignment." With "name" and "reality" so confused, "official functions" and "responsibilities" became extremely unclear, resembling the "guest appearances" and "cross-dressing" on today's theatrical stage. Just considering the Secretariat-Chancellery, those with the nominal title of officials of the Secretariat-Chancellery were all assigned to agencies outside the Secretariat-Chancellery to "share the various duties," while the affairs of the various departments and offices of the Secretariat-Chancellery were "mostly adjudicated by other officials," meaning that people with titles of officials from other agencies were assigned to serve in the Secretariat-Chancellery. Since the officials were all guest appearances or even cross-dressers, and they were mostly transferred frequently, and there might not even be enough staff at ordinary times, the affairs of the Secretariat-Chancellery, not only the major issues of "governing the country and administering state affairs, managing the balance of yin and yang," but even minor matters of documents and details, had to be handled personally by the prime minister or executive officials. As a result, the vast amount of detailed work prevented the prime minister and executive officials from having enough time to think about the major plans of the country. Therefore, "clearing up the affairs of the Secretariat-Chancellery" became a common view among enlightened people who understood the system of governance at the time.</p>
<p>One of the immediate causes for the establishment of the "Office for Review and Compilation of Regulations of the Secretariat-Chancellery" was that the accumulation of Secretariat-Chancellery affairs led to mistakes in handling events. The Compilation of Regulations Office section of the Classified Draft of the Song Statutes records the matter as follows:</p>
<p>On the eighth day of the fourth month of the second year of the Xining reign of Emperor Shenzong, which coincided with the Heavenly Celebration Festival, the Court of Imperial Sacrifices requested that, as in the fourth year of the Zhiping reign, the officials go to the Gemen Gate to offer congratulations. The Emperor said: "In the fourth year of the Zhiping reign and on the day the spirit carriage of the late Emperor was in the funeral, now the two empress dowagers are celebrating their birthdays. It is not appropriate for the ceremonial officials to cite the examples of mourning. I cannot bear to hear it in my feelings as a son. It should only be said: On the day of the Heavenly Celebration Festival, the prime ministers, civil officials, and military officers should all go to the East Shangge Gate to present memorials." Wang Anshi then said: "This is truly the fault of the Secretariat-Chancellery in failing to review it properly. The affairs of the Secretariat-Chancellery are piled up. If an office is not established early and the affairs are assigned to the relevant departments, there is no way to manage it."</p>
<p>The Emperor said to Fu Bi: "If we want to govern well now, we must start with the Secretariat-Chancellery. When establishing an office in the Secretariat-Chancellery, we should carefully select junior officials."</p>
<p>Zeng Gongliang said: "The prime minister's office should use honest and simple people. Therefore, this dynasty does not use graduates of the imperial examinations, but only uses scholars." Wang Anshi said: "We should select outstanding talents from among the lower ranks and have them compile regulations and review documents."</p>
<p>On the fourteenth day of the sixth month, the Emperor said to Wang Anshi: "Establishing an office in the Secretariat-Chancellery to revise the regulations is the most urgent matter."</p>
<p>Wang Anshi said: "This is the root of the matter. Those who revise the regulations must know the kingly principles, understand the national policies, and not be blinded by common custom. Only then can they do it. If people of common custom cannot see beyond common custom, how can their proposals surpass the old ones? Now that Your Majesty wants to revise the regulations, you should first consult widely with the officials and scholars. With Your Majesty's intelligence and wisdom, personally selecting virtuous officials and scholars will surely find the right people. If you can find five or six people to entrust to the Secretariat-Chancellery to revise the regulations, and they present a report every few days, with Your Majesty deciding what is right and wrong, then the establishment of laws and regulations will have a deadline. If you only let the Secretariat-Chancellery choose the people, I am afraid that the people used will be of common custom. How can people of common custom discuss changing the affairs of common custom? All the regulations of today were established by ministers since the late years of Emperor Renzong. How can people be willing to completely change what they have established to follow others? I am afraid that Your Majesty must make a sole decision in order to achieve something."</p>
<p>The Emperor said: "I will wait for myself to select people, but I am afraid it will be delayed."</p>
<p>Wang Anshi said: "This matter cannot be delayed, but it cannot be rushed either. If you do not know the kingly principles, understand the national policies, and are able to change the affairs of common custom, then it is no different from not revising the regulations. This is why it cannot be rushed. However, there are talented people now. You must pay attention to examining and selecting them, and you cannot delay it either."</p>
<p>On the sixteenth day of the ninth month, Li Chang and Lü Huiqing, officials for reviewing and inspecting the regulations, reviewed the compilation of regulations of the Secretariat-Chancellery. Previously, Wang Anshi had repeatedly said to the Emperor: "Now the Secretariat-Chancellery is the origin of political affairs. If you want to govern the laws and regulations, it is most urgent to start with the Secretariat-Chancellery. You must first select people to compile the regulations." Therefore, he highly praised Huiqing and Chang and used them both...</p>
<p>The Emperor believed that the court spent too much time reviewing minor details of various departments, while the ministers could not discuss the major issues of political affairs. He believed that matters that could be assigned to the departments should be assigned to them, and the Secretariat-Chancellery should be responsible for their correctness. Then the departments would do their best and the affairs would be well-managed. Therefore, he ordered the Regulations Office to discuss and remove the redundancies. From then on, more and more matters were assigned to the departments, and the affairs of the Secretariat-Chancellery were cleared up. (Official Posts, 5, 8-11)</p>
<p>To what extent the affairs of the Secretariat-Chancellery were complicated in the past, and what matters have been cleared up by this "Office for Review and Compilation of Regulations," we can find many examples in the Statutes. Now I will take two examples:</p>
<p>Example 1: In the past, for new officials assigned to posts, what the government should provide and what it should reward all had established rules to follow. However, it was still necessary for the Secretariat-Chancellery to verify the established rules and notify the Three Offices to issue them. The same was true for members of the imperial clan who were newly assigned posts or titles. The Compilation of Regulations Office believed that this was a matter that "should be assigned to the relevant departments" and made changes. Afterwards, regardless of whether officials or members of the imperial clan were newly assigned posts, the Three Offices would directly handle the due stipends and rewards according to the established rules.</p>
<p>Example 2: People with titles in the capital who were assigned to serve as civil administrators or general affairs officials in the circuits and military garrisons, if they requested leave for matters such as relocating graves, in the past, it was necessary for the Transport Office to report to the court, and then the Secretariat-Chancellery would issue a special imperial decree to approve it. The Compilation of Regulations Office believed that this was also a matter that "should be assigned to the relevant departments" and made changes. Afterwards, for those personnel who requested leave for matters such as returning to bury their ancestors, it was only necessary for the Transport Office to verify the facts and grant leave, and there was no need to wait for the Secretariat-Chancellery to issue a special imperial decree.</p>
<p>Although the Statutes recorded dozens of redundant affairs that were cleared up by the Compilation of Regulations Office, there must have been many more that were not recorded. Therefore, we still cannot know how many items were cleared up in total. On the twenty-second day of the tenth month of the eighth year of the Xining reign, when Wang Anshi had already been dismissed as prime minister for a year and a half, this Compilation of Regulations Office was abolished along with the "Office for Revising the Regulations of the Ministry of Revenue" because it "demanded documents, harassed the official agencies, and did not contribute to the actual situation."</p>
<p>The Separate Records of Official Systems section of the Song Statutes contains a preface to the Official Posts section of the Veritable Records of Emperor Shenzong, which states:</p>
<p>Emperors Taizu and Taizong corrected the abuses of regional military commissioners and garrison commanders, and then sent officials such as Assistant Ministers and Directors of Ministries to lead posts outside [the capital]... The dynasty continued this practice without making any reforms for more than a hundred years, and the officials gradually lost their substance... When Emperor Shenzong ascended the throne, he wanted to greatly improve this, saying that the Secretariat-Chancellery was the foundation of political affairs. He first established the Office for the Establishment of Regulations of the Secretariat-Chancellery and set up five offices of inspection officials to clear up the affairs of the Secretariat-Chancellery. He also established the Office for the Establishment of Regulations of the Three Offices to manage the finances of the empire... Therefore, the laws and regulations were clear, and the schools and academies flourished... The practical measures for governing and managing officials were truly abundant, but the names were not yet rectified.</p>
<p>This passage says that although the reform of the official system was only implemented during the Yuanfeng reign, during Wang Anshi's administration in the middle of the Xining reign, he had already started from the practical aspects to "correct" the official system. Clearing up the redundant affairs of the Secretariat-Chancellery through the "Office for the Establishment of Regulations of the Secretariat-Chancellery" was considered a major event in reforming the laws. If we evaluate all the work of the "Office for Review and Compilation of Regulations," we feel that this passage from the Veritable Records of Emperor Shenzong is an excessive praise. Because the establishment of this "Office for Review and Compilation of Regulations of the Secretariat-Chancellery" was aimed at reforming the laws, and in Wang Anshi's original intention, he wanted the new laws to "conform to the governance of the former kings." Although the redundant affairs of the Secretariat-Chancellery at that time should be reformed, the most fundamental issues concerning the laws were definitely not this matter. Issues such as "the Chancellor of the Secretariat not participating in court affairs," "the Vice Minister not leading the ministerial duties," "the remonstrating officials having no responsibility to speak out, and the recorders not taking notes," "the Secretariat-Chancellery often closing its doors," and "the remonstrating officials and upright speakers not performing their duties of remonstrance," that is, what is called "holding the office without knowing the duties," "the matters entrusted being lost by two or three out of ten," and the abuses of "name and reality being confused, and the number of personnel being redundant and excessive," these were the most urgent tasks that should be "revised and reformed." The Compilation of Regulations Office, by abandoning these most fundamental issues and only slightly clearing up the redundant affairs of the Secretariat-Chancellery, cannot be considered as abandoning the essential for the trivial.

<h3>Explanation of the Ranks and Salaries of the Zhou Dynasty in the History of the Sui Dynasty's Treatise on Officials</h3>
<p>— Chen Yuan</p>
<p>Writing is intended to be easily understood, but during the Northern Zhou Dynasty, there was a period of revival of antiquity, where extremely obvious facts were described in extremely roundabout language, such as the section on the ranks and salaries of the Zhou system in the twenty-seventh chapter of the History of the Sui Dynasty's Treatise on Officials. Now, I will first cite the original text and then explain it as follows:</p>
<p>The Zhou system: For ranks and salaries, the lowest scholar received 125 shi of grain. Middle scholars and above, up to Grand Masters, each doubled that amount. Grand Masters received 4,000 shi.</p>
<p>Ministers received an additional one-half, dukes received an additional one-third, and lords received an additional one-quarter, each adding one to their respective amounts. Lords, based on the rounded figure, received 10,000 shi.</p>
<p>The ninth rank received 120 shi. From the eighth rank to the seventh rank, and for every two ranks below, each decreased by one-sixth, with the second ranks receiving 40 shi.</p>
<p>"Middle scholars and above, up to Grand Masters, each doubled that amount" means that middle scholars received 250 shi, upper scholars received 500 shi, junior grand masters received 1,000 shi, and middle grand masters received 2,000 shi.</p>
<p>"Ministers received an additional one-half, dukes received an additional one-third, and lords received an additional one-quarter, each adding one to their respective amounts" means that ministers received an additional one-half of the grand master's amount, making 6,000 shi; dukes received an additional one-third of the minister's amount, making 8,000 shi; and lords received an additional one-quarter of the duke's amount, making 10,000 shi.</p>
<p>"From the eighth rank to the seventh rank, and for every two ranks below, each decreased by one-sixth" means that for every two ranks below the eighth rank, each decreased by one-sixth of the ninth rank's amount. Therefore, the eighth and seventh ranks received 100 shi, the sixth and fifth ranks received 80 shi, and the fourth and third ranks received 60 shi. The second and first ranks received 40 shi. I initially suspected that there was a missing character in the last sentence of the original text, which should have been "the first and second ranks received 40 shi." Later, according to the "Ranks and Salaries" section of the Comprehensive Institutions, and the section on stipends and salaries in the General Record Office Volume, which both cite "the first and second ranks both received 40 shi," I know that the current edition of the History of the Sui Dynasty actually omits the words "first rank." My doubts are now cleared. If we list this as a table, it will be immediately clear.</p>
<p>Table of Ranks and Salaries of the Later Zhou Dynasty:</p>
<p>Lower Scholar 125</p>
<p>Middle Scholar 250</p>
<p>Upper Scholar 500</p>
<p>Junior Grand Master 1,000</p>
<p>Middle Grand Master 2,000</p>
<p>Grand Master 4,000</p>
<p>The amounts above are each doubled.</p>
<p>Minister Duke Lord 6,000 8,000 10,000</p>
<p>The amounts above increase by 2,000 shi each.</p>
<p>Ninth Rank 120</p>
<p>Eighth and Seventh Ranks 100</p>
<p>Sixth and Fifth Ranks 80</p>
<p>Fourth and Third Ranks 60</p>
<p>Second and First Ranks 40</p>
<p>The amounts above decrease by 20 shi.</p>
<h3>The Year of Wang Tao's Death</h3>
<p>— Xu Guangmo</p>
<p>Tiannan Dunsou Wang Tao was born in the eighth year of the Daoguang reign, 1828 AD. However, there is still no reliable record of the year of his death. Mr. Hu Shi said in his Outline of Chinese Literary History that he "died in the twenty-first year of the Guangxu reign" (page 330). According to my investigation, this is a mistake.</p>
<p>Hong Shen's article "Evidence of Mao Zhuangyuan Wang Tao, the Chief Editor of the Shen Bao" (see the second volume, sixth issue of Literature published by the Life Bookstore), written before the war, did not ascertain the month and year of his death. I have been paying attention to materials in this area, and finally, in the preface of a not-so-noticeable Plum Orchid Prose Collection, I solved this question.</p>
<p>Plum Orchid Prose Collection is a small-sized typeset collection of poems written by Xu Zhaolan. Xu was from Wu County and a fellow villager of Wang Tao. The collection records their close friendship. There are seven prefaces in front of the collection. In addition to one written by Xu himself, the other six were written by Wang Tao, Yu Yue, Chen Dejun, Miao Shaochu, Wu Guangxu, and Liu Jiashu. The preface written by Wang Tao is dated to the year Gui Si of the Guangxu reign, i.e., the nineteenth year. The preface written by Yu Quyuan is dated to the year Yi Wei of the Guangxu reign, i.e., the twenty-first year, and says:</p>
<p>"In the spring of Yi Wei, Mr. Xu and Dunsou of Tiannan visited me at the Chunzai Hall in Wumen, and took out the Plum Orchid Prose Collection and asked me to write a preface for it..." From this, we can know that Wang Tao was still alive in the twenty-first year of the Guangxu reign. Miao Shaochu's preface has the following words: "You (referring to Mr. Xu) were skilled in imperial examinations from a young age and loved poetry. You were friends with Dunsou of Tiannan and Chameshan Ren, and often pursued each other in poetry and wine... Chameshan Ren has passed away, and Dunsou returned to Daoshan this autumn. I lament the difficulty of meeting old friends again and admire the new poems as brocade..." This preface is signed "Winter of Ding You of the Guangxu reign, Miao Xunlian of Lushan Shaochu recorded." Ding You is the twenty-third year of the Guangxu reign, so Wang Tao died in the autumn of the twenty-third year of the Guangxu reign. This question has finally been resolved. (Drafted on the night of the heavy snow on January 23 of the thirty-seventh year of the Republic of China in Lilin)</p>
<p>Editor's Postscript</p>
<p>Mr. Xu Guangmo sent this short article from Xuancheng, letting us know that Wang Tao died in the Ding You year, the twenty-third year of the Guangxu reign, 1897 AD. Many scholars will welcome this small textual research. The newly published "Eminent Chinese of the Ching Period" (edited by Arthur W. Hummel) in the United States in recent years has a biography of Wang Tao written by my friend Roswell S. Britton (pages 836-839), saying that he was born on November 10, 1828 (Gregorian calendar), but it also did not ascertain the year of his death. Last year, I heard that a friend in Shanghai had already ascertained that Wang Tao died in the twenty-third year of the Guangxu reign, at the age of seventy. I recorded his death in this year on my World Events Chronology, but I did not note the source or who ascertained it at the time. (I would be grateful if someone could point it out.) Mr. Xu Guangmo's citation of Miao Menglian's preface to the Plum Orchid Idle Prose Collection is credible evidence. Although Wang Tao was not a "Mao Zhuangyuan," he was indeed the lead writer of the Shen Bao. I hope that the editorial department of the Shen Bao can take the time to look through the old newspapers from the autumn of the twenty-third year of the Guangxu reign and give a final conclusion to the year of Wang Tao's death. Hu Shi. 37, 2, 25.</p>
<p>After thoroughly searching this newspaper from January of the 23rd year of Guangxu to March of the 24th year of Guangxu, there is no record of Wang Tao. There is only one advertisement on November 4th of the 23rd year of Guangxu, which reads: "Skilled in medical skills," with the inscription "Elegant appreciation of Renxiong Sima of Jinghu," and the signature "Dedicated by Tiannan Dunsou Wang Tao," likely inscribed for a doctor, but it is not enough to prove that he was still alive at this time. -- This newspaper's archives</p>

<h3>"Carriage Driver" and "Driver"</h3>
<p>— Jingwen</p>
<p>The cancellation of the title "Automobile Carriage Driver" and its replacement with "Driver" has already been formally announced by the relevant authorities. Although this is a small issue, it has caused many storms in the mainland and Shanghai. "Driver" originally referred to a skilled worker. In the past, they were regarded as "laborers" simply because people serving others have always been tagged with the suffix "fu." For example, school workers were called "Zaifu" in the past, sedan chair carriers were called "Jiaofu," cooks were called "Huofu," and those who pulled and drove vehicles were all called "Chefu."</p>
<p>However, in my opinion, the term "fu" is not necessarily bad. For example, people in the north call doctors "Daifu," and women in the past hoped to become first-rank "Furen." If someone respectfully called you "Fuzi," you would definitely not consider it an insult. And those who devote themselves to serving their wives are called "Zhangfu," and upright men are called "Dazhangfu." This shows that the single character "fu" has so many uses. Moreover, the rise and fall of a nation depends on the contributions of every "Pifu," which further illustrates that every citizen of the country is a "Fu."</p>
<p>Since the term "fu" is not bad, it seems unnecessary to quibble over the term "driver" instead of "Automobile Carriage Driver." However, the issue is not so simple, because you and I both know that in the past, most people's use of the term "Automobile Carriage Driver" carried a certain amount of disrespect. After the Anti-Japanese War, under the slogan of "a drop of gasoline is a drop of blood," the social status of drivers in the rear areas became increasingly important, which changed people's past perceptions. Moreover, drivers are indeed in charge of the machinery, and they are ultimately different from those who rely solely on human power to pull vehicles. Therefore, to be consistent with the facts, it is indeed more appropriate to use the term "driver."</p>
<p>Europeans and Americans call automobile drivers "Chauffeur," and the Japanese call them "Untenshu." The origin of the word "Chauffeur" is not very clear, but I believe that the three characters "Untenshu" seem to be more descriptive and appropriate than the two characters "Driver." This shows that the Japanese are indeed a little clever in many ways.</p>
<p>However, although rectification of names is important, raising the social status of a profession cannot be achieved simply by making superficial changes in the name. Whether in Europe, America, or Japan, driving a car has the same social status as other professions and is equally respected. Not only is this true for drivers, but also for other people who earn a living through skills or labor. They are rarely discriminated against by society, and there is no sense of insult over the name due to professional status.</p>
<p>I believe that the sense of insult over the name of a profession stems partly from the unequal factors that still exist in society, and partly from the professional ethics and professional atmosphere of the practitioners themselves. Especially in today's society in our country, professional ethics and the professional atmosphere have a great impact on the social status of a certain profession.</p>
<p>In the past, the rewards of a profession were often seen as the dividing standard of professional status. It seemed that the more money one earned, the higher the profession. For example, the ranking of scholars, farmers, artisans, and merchants reflects this mentality. In the past, being an official was a first-class profession, a privilege of "scholars," the so-called "learning leads to officialdom." Next was the salaried class in long gowns. Customs, post offices, and banks were all "golden rice bowls" at the time. Even school teachers were a remarkable profession in the past.</p>
<p>But now it is different. If we use the past standard of dividing professional status by the amount of money earned, then today's working class should undoubtedly occupy the throne of the professional world. Those who were remarkable in the past have now completely reversed their positions. Therefore, in terms of profession, today's workers have no need to feel inferior. However, raising the social status of a profession is not entirely determined by rewards, but by professional ethics and atmosphere.</p>
<p>To fight for the honor of a profession, rectification of names is naturally important, but rectification of names is not only for the sake of the name, but should also emphasize raising the professional ethics and reputation of the profession. No matter what system is changed in the future society, those who live by skills and labor will always be the pillars of society. By improving one's professional cultivation under this belief, one can break through any social prejudice and self-inferiority.</p>
<h3>Anecdotes about Marshall</h3>
<p>— Yingmin</p>
<p>One day, Mr. and Mrs. Marshall drove to a gas station to refuel. After the car was filled up, they were about to drive away when a military vehicle drove up and blocked their way. Two corporals jumped out of the car and stood outside the car window chatting and laughing with their girlfriends, seemingly very happy.</p>
<p>After waiting for five minutes, they were still talking. Finally, Marshall stuck his head out and said, "Please move your car a little to let me out."</p>
<p>The two soldiers glanced at him, but turned their heads to talk to their girlfriends. After a while, the four of them walked into the gas station together, leaving the car parked there. As they passed Marshall's car, they said to him, "Buddy, be civilized!"</p>
<p>Fifteen minutes later, they returned home, and Mrs. Marshall explained to her daughter why they were late. The daughter asked, "What did Dad do?" Mrs. Marshall said, "He was very civilized!"</p>
<h3>White-Collar Class</h3>
<p>— Ji Mo</p>
<p>Several years ago, while reading a political and economic history written by an American, I encountered terms like "capitalism" and "petty bourgeoisie," which felt somewhat peculiar and novel at the time. Then, I came across the term "white-collar class."</p>
<p>The translation of "white-collar class" seems to be a direct one. Indeed, there are many people in our country who wear Western suits with snow-white collared shirts. However, if we translated it as "long gown class," it might be easier for us to understand. If we further interpret "long gown class" as "salary class," then looking around society, people bustling to and fro are everywhere, and we can feel a personal connection.</p>
<p>Since World War II, the treatment of the white-collar class has been inferior to that of the non-white-collar class, or the working class. A newly established publishing company in the United States created a comparative statistical chart of the incomes of the two groups from 1940 to September 1947. In 1940, the difference was limited, but from 1941 onwards, it gradually widened, reaching a significant gap by 1944. After the war ended, the former's treatment rapidly caught up, but before long, it once again showed a trend of being out of reach. As of the third quarter of 1947, the two still differed by about 20 percent.</p>
<p>As a result, a recent trend in the United States is that many employees of securities firms, power companies, insurance companies, and the like are inclined to shed their white shirts and switch to factories. "Office work" is no longer as attractive as it once was.</p>
<p>The other day, I went to an enterprise company to see a friend who works there as an accountant. Wearing a suit, he can be said to be a standard white-collar worker. I talked to him for a while, perhaps because soap prices have risen too sharply these days, and I noticed that his shirt had not been washed for a long time, the collar turning a patch of gray. I think in a few more days, this white-collar worker may not be far from becoming a black-collar worker, assuming we even have this kind of distinction of a black-collar class.</p>
<h3>Appreciating "Greatness"</h3>
<p>— He Ku</p>
<p>On behalf of a friend, I went to the bank to withdraw a remittance of ten million yuan. What I received was a stack of red five-thousand-yuan Guan Jin notes, effortlessly placed in a bag without feeling any weight. Although I have seen these banknotes for over three months, it was the first time I had such a neat stack in my own bag, even if only temporarily. I still felt very poor.</p>
<p>This banknote can now only buy twenty sesame cakes, barely enough for one person's daily sustenance. However, in the poems of ancient people, it would have been enough to travel to Yangzhou in the second month of spring to enjoy the flower season: "With a hundred thousand strings of cash around my waist, I ride a crane to Yangzhou." Its luxury is equivalent to taking a tyrant's plane to Beijing for a pleasure trip. Therefore, in terms of numbers, our era is great enough. No wealthy ancient person, from Deng Tong and Ji Ran to the Qing Dynasty's eunuch Heshen, had as much money as one of our civil servants today. What's so rare about a hundred thousand strings of cash? It's only worth over three hundred yuan today, an amount that even beggars on the street would disdain!</p>
<p>Westerners consider millionaires to be extraordinary figures. However, today, the income of any small clerk can at least match several Western "millionaires." From this point of view, the comfort and honor of Chinese and foreign people are only worth our scorn. Many things that caused a sensation in the past are now laughable. There's no need to look at old historical accounts. Take the recent events of twenty years ago: the wife of a mayor in Nanjing bought a pair of silk stockings for twenty-five yuan, and it was treated as news, with people praising and envying, criticizing and attacking, ridiculing and mocking, and discussing the impropriety of the official's conduct. It was a lively period. From today's perspective, if I were to buy a pair of ordinary cotton socks, the cost would be exactly one of the red bills mentioned above, totaling one hundred thousand yuan. However, it would not become a sensational news item, nor would anyone attack my conduct as being improper, doubt whether my income was illegal, envy my luxurious enjoyment, or sneer at my inappropriate status. The key is that everyone has to buy socks for one hundred thousand yuan a pair. A mere twenty-five yuan a pair is like asking a paper shop to make a pair for use as grave goods, and the shop would definitely refuse it. In the past, twenty yuan a pair of socks could constitute news. Today, one hundred thousand yuan a pair has become a common phenomenon. That's why I say this is the greatness of the era. If the government reforms the monetary system, then the huge numbers will come to an end. The great era will be cut into segments, and this segment will have a name: "unprecedented."</p>
<p>I think today's monetary figures should be appreciated more than used practically. In other words, the view of today's currency is akin to quenching thirst with plums. "Thirst" represents great wealth. When you think about the numbers, you feel like you are living the life of a millionaire.</p>
<h3>Talking About Romance of the Three Kingdoms Operas</h3>
<p>— Yi Hong</p>
<p>When Peking opera troupes came to Beijing in the early years, the Sanqing Troupe (now known as the Old Sanqing) was the most renowned for its talent. The troupe had three leading male actors, one from the Han school, Yu Sansheng, one from the Hui school, Cheng Changgeng (known in the troupe as the "Big Boss"), and the third was Lu Shengkui (called "Lu Taizi" by his peers).</p>
<p>Lu Taizi was originally a failed scholar who was well-versed in literature. He felt frustrated by his inferior position. However, given the environment in the troupe, he could not compete with Cheng and Yu for prominence. When he was not performing in the main scenes, he played supporting roles for Cheng and Yu, such as the Sixth Prince in "Visiting His Mother," Wang Ba in "Fighting at Puguan," Chen Jingsi in "Pearl Curtain Fortress," and Gongsun Chujiu in "Searching for the Orphan." He was essentially placed in a supporting role, what is now known as the second-tier old male role. Lu always felt this was regrettable. So, he secretly consulted Romance of the Three Kingdoms and specially wrote a complete Romance of the Three Kingdoms play, starting from Zhuge Liang's debate with the scholars and ending with Kongming's death during the star-arranging ritual during his final military campaign. After the play was written, he sought advice from the Big Boss. Cheng greatly valued it and first staged the "Heroic Assembly" scene. The cast included the Big Boss as Zhuge Liang, Yu Sansheng as Lu Su, Xu Xiaoxiang as Zhou Yu, Qian Shifeng as Huang Gai, and Liu Gan San as Jiang Gan. Lu also played both Zhuge Liang and Lu Su. After this play was test-performed, it became very popular. The Big Boss saw that Lu's movements in the play were vivid and lifelike, and he shifted his attention to Lu and greatly appreciated him. Later, when Romance of the Three Kingdoms was performed again, Lu was assigned to play the leading roles in the play, and his reputation soared. From then on, Lu was able to make a name for himself in the theatrical world.</p>
<p>The complete Romance of the Three Kingdoms is divided into twenty-three parts, which can be performed over twenty-three days. According to opera troupe tradition, every year in the twelfth lunar month, because of the cold weather and lack of heating in the theater, the audience feared the cold. Without good plays, it was difficult to fill seats. Only performing this play could maintain attendance. After Lu Taizi wrote the new complete Romance of the Three Kingdoms play, the Big Boss believed that it could fill seats, so he staged the play in the twelfth lunar month, starting from the first day of the month and performing it for twenty-three days straight, regardless of wind or snow, one part each day, finishing on the twenty-third day, the Kitchen God Festival. The last part was the closing play. This play was vivid and complete, combining civil and military elements, and featuring various opera styles. It was the most wonderful of the troupe's plays. The Old Sanqing performed this play once a year. Every time it was performed, the upstairs boxes were reserved in advance, and even the general seating area was filled with long-term spectators, which shows the true value of this play.</p>
<p>In the late Qing Dynasty, after the Old Sanqing disbanded, no one performed this play for a time. It was not until Ye Chunshen founded the Fuliancheng Opera School and found the original script that he continued to stage the complete Romance of the Three Kingdoms. It was first performed by the Xi generation, but it was not very good. When the Lian generation, such as Ma Lianliang, Cheng Lianxi, Luo Lianxiang, and Su Lianhan, performed it, it was better than the initial performance. However, when they performed it, they could not perform the entire play to the end, stopping after the "Battle of Changsha," which was a shortcoming. Among them, Ma Lianliang's male roles, Cheng Lianxi's young male roles, Luo Lianxiang's military roles, and Su Lianhan's painted face roles all had their merits. Later, when the Fu and Sheng generations performed it again, they were not as talented as the Lian generation. The Shi and Yuan generations focused on female roles and did not value the Romance of the Three Kingdoms play. After Fu Sucheng disbanded, the complete Romance of the Three Kingdoms could no longer be performed in its entirety because it was difficult to gather the necessary roles. What can be seen on stage now are only excerpts. It is no longer possible to see the whole picture.</p>
<h3>Abolishing the Death Penalty and Life Imprisonment</h3>
<p>— Shi Wen</p>
<p>Last year, the Soviet Union's abolition of the death penalty and life imprisonment received close attention from around the world. As a result, the United Kingdom also considered abolishing the death penalty, but the effort failed.</p>
<p>Let's see what happened after the Soviet Union abolished the death penalty.</p>
<p>Recently, a Soviet military court in Berlin tried fourteen Nazi war criminals. These fourteen devils had slowly tortured to death one hundred thousand innocent men and women in the Sachsenhausen concentration camp. The evidence was solid, and the defendants all confessed.</p>
<p>Logically, murderers should die, especially these fourteen devils, whose victims numbered as many as one hundred thousand! However, at the sentencing, each of them escaped with their lives—receiving twenty-five years of imprisonment.</p>
<p>Twenty-five years of imprisonment is already the heaviest sentence currently in the Soviet Union. The judge had no choice but to sentence them that way, but he himself was also gnashing his teeth in pain, admitting that he had given too light a sentence.</p>
<h3>A Fleeting Romance</h3>
<p>— Chen Shenyan</p>
<p>Chapter Twelve: A Chance Encounter (103)</p>
<p>The next day, Qi Wan came to Liu Ru's house. Liu Ru said to Qi Wan, "During our conversation yesterday, I could see that what Dao Yun said was unreliable in all likelihood. He said that the headquarters were in Hong Kong, and you can go to Hong Kong with him to see for yourself. If what he said is empty, find a way out as soon as possible and don't ruin your future, because I've heard that he's already married. Whether his family is in Hong Kong or not, I don't know very well. As long as you get to Hong Kong, the whole truth can be revealed." Qi Wan said, "I also suspect him very much. When I go back today, I will ask him to go to Hong Kong and see what he says. If he has ulterior motives, he will definitely try to avoid going, and I can break up with him." Liu Ru said, "Don't be so reckless. You might as well observe the situation. Your first step is to ask to go to Hong Kong, and when he doesn't agree, you can come back and discuss it with me." After the mother and daughter agreed, Qi Wan went back and saw Dao Yun busily packing his things. Qi Wan was very surprised and asked, "What are you packing these things for?" Dao Yun said, "My ship ticket has already been booked, and I'm going to Hong Kong tomorrow." Qi Wan was surprised to hear this and asked, "Really?" Dao Yun smiled and said, "Isn't that what we planned? After a couple of days in Shanghai, we have to go to Hong Kong. Our headquarters are in Hong Kong, and we can't delay any longer, because there are many things that need to be resolved when I get to Hong Kong." Qi Wan was surprised by what he said and said, "That's good. We'll leave tomorrow. I have to tell my mother." Dao Yun said, "I think the old lady will be reluctant to see you come to Shanghai for a few days and then go to Hong Kong. You have to tell her slowly that we'll be back soon. After we come back, we'll have a big party." Qi Wan smiled when she heard what Wu Yun said, which was beyond her expectations, and said, "I've already told my mother. When my mother heard that your headquarters are in Hong Kong, she also wants me to visit and report back to her, so that she can be happy." Dao Yun was stunned when he heard this and asked, "Your mother is probably very interested in my Hong Kong headquarters, right?" Qi Wan said, "Of course." Dao Yun said, "It's still in the early stages, and there's nothing to see. It will be at least half a year before there are any results." Qi Wan saw that his words were not as exaggerated as they had been in Beijing, and she knew that he had become timid. She still smiled and said, "You don't have to be polite with me. I know you have many friends. Many big tycoons in Hong Kong are your backers." Dao Yun said, "Things are not that simple. You'll know when you get there!" Qi Wan didn't say anything more and just helped Wu Yun pack the things he needed to bring. The next day, the two of them went to Liu Ru's house to say goodbye. Liu Ru secretly repeatedly urged Qi Wan to observe the situation in Hong Kong and not to condone anything, and to make a decisive decision. That day, she treated the two of them for half a day and personally sent them on board before returning home. (End of chapter)</p>

<h3>Husband Sacrificed for the Country, Appealing for Employment, Received Higher Education and Excellent Knowledge</h3>
<p>Editor: I am a family member of an anti-Japanese war officer. Unfortunately, my husband was killed in action in the Battle of Myanmar in December 1943. At that time, there was also a two-year-old boy. The widow and orphan have since lived a miserable life. Initially, the rear headquarters (my late husband graduated from the student army) provided a compensation of one million yuan. The state's pension until 1946 was less than 700,000 yuan. Last year's pension, entrusted to someone or received in person, took three months, and the food subsidy included only 420,000 yuan. How can our mother and child live on such a small pension!</p>
<p>Originally, there were also in-laws to rely on, but they did not recognize this woman who married freely outside, nor did they recognize this fatherless orphan. After repeatedly asking people to plead, they still could not get the in-laws to take them in, which is heartbreaking! The union of our husband and wife was the result of more than three years of love. I am a woman who has received higher education, and my late husband was an American overseas Chinese. At first, all the classmates envied our happy marriage. Now, does society pity our mother and child?</p>
<p>I am thirty-five years old this year, and the child is so young. How can I spend the years to come? Originally from Fujian, living in Sichuan, now wandering in Shanghai, I hope for the help of benevolent gentlemen to give me a job, whether it is teaching (Chinese, history, geography, civics) or being a housekeeper, nanny, or family secretary, I can handle it. As long as I can live, that's enough. I don't want any reward. Please publish an advertisement in your newspaper to appeal for help. Yours sincerely, Gu Qing, an unfortunate person.</p>

<h3>Two Stories from the Old Capital</h3>
<p>— Banmeng Laoren</p>
<p>Matters of gods, immortals, and ghosts are mostly vague and unclear. Some people believe they are real, while others believe they are completely false. It is impossible to provide definitive proof of what is real and what is not. When we were young, we read Pu Songling's Strange Tales from a Chinese Studio, and we always thought that his writings were nothing more than fabrications, and that there could not be such bizarre things in the human world. But when we thought of "the vastness of the world, full of wonders," we didn't dare to say for sure that they didn't exist.</p>
<p>In 1930, I lived in Mingwa Lane (a place name) in Nanjing with five or six good friends, each occupying a room. They all said that my room often made extremely loud noises at night, as if someone was slamming their hand on the table in anger, or as if someone was pacing back and forth on the floor, the sound of shoes pounding. But when I slept in this room at night, I always slept soundly and never heard any movement. I thought that what they were saying was mostly fabricated. However, a friend named Wu, who was old and suffered from a long-term cough, often couldn't sleep all night. He especially thought that this was indeed the case and had heard it more than once. He repeatedly advised me not to stay in this room anymore, fearing that something ominous would happen in the future. It was a good intention, and although I didn't believe it, he didn't object. Because I had never seen it or heard it myself, they insisted on it, so I just listened to it as a story.</p>
<p>Later, after I retired and returned home, I happened to meet an old colleague from Beijing, Mr. So-and-so, who talked about the strange news when Mr. Chu, whom we all knew well, died (I had heard about it at the time, but it was vague). It turned out that Mr. Chu had first worked in the Supreme Court (formerly called the Daliyuan), and later also served as a counselor in the Ministry of Justice, working at a desk in the counselor's office of the Ministry of Justice. He was very honest and always arrived early every day, which everyone in both departments knew.</p>
<p>Who knew that Mr. Chu suddenly died of illness one Sunday in winter, very quickly and unexpectedly. At that time, everyone didn't know much about it. The next day, Monday, Mr. Qian, a counselor in the Ministry of Justice, went into the counselor's office first when he arrived at the ministry in the morning, took off his coat, and washed his face. When he turned around, he saw Mr. Chu sitting at the desk, with a child standing next to the desk. Mr. Qian had always seen him arrive very early, and although there was a child, he didn't think it was strange (because people often brought children to the ministry at that time). After turning around, he went into another room and saw a mourning notice for Mr. Chu on Mr. So-and-so's desk. He said, "There should be limits to joking, can you falsely report someone's death?" Mr. So-and-so said, "Mr. Chu did die yesterday. Don't you know, sir?" Mr. Qian said, "Strange, strange. There is evidence of this. I just saw Mr. Chu sitting at the desk working, and there was a child standing next to the desk. If you don't believe me, you can go and see." So Mr. So-and-so and Mr. Qian went to the counselor's office together, but there was nothing there. When they asked the people sitting near Mr. Chu, they hadn't seen Mr. Chu sitting there working either. Mr. Qian was very surprised. At that time, there was also a colleague in the ministry, Mr. Zhang, who personally saw Mr. Chu arriving at the ministry. Mr. Chu's car was behind, and his car was in front. Mr. Chu's car passed his car, and they all entered the gate of the Ministry of Justice together, but unfortunately he didn't greet him. So, although Mr. Chu died, it can prove that his soul had not yet disappeared.</p>
<p>Mr. So-and-so also said that in 1927, a sword immortal named Wang came to Beijing. It is said that this sword immortal was sent by the military governor's office of Gansu. Zhang Guangjian, the military governor of Gansu, saw a white light emitted from the mountain and sent people to search for the location of the white light, and then discovered Wang the Sword Immortal. He invited him to the governor's office and tested him several times, and his skills were indeed considerable. Later, he learned that this Wang the Sword Immortal was a classmate of Mr. Luo, a vice minister of a certain ministry, so he sent him to Beijing to live in Mr. Luo's house. Mr. Luo never knew that he had any abilities, nor had he ever tested him once. Suddenly, a person with an extraordinary aura came and saw from afar that a strange white light was emitted from where Mr. Luo was staying. He said that he had said to Mr. Ding'an in the past, "There must be an extraordinary person under the azure mist." There must be an extraordinary person in Mr. Luo's residence, otherwise, where would this white light come from? So he personally visited Wang the Sword Immortal and decided at first sight that he was no ordinary person. From then on, it spread to the ears of the minister (the minister is the department head) of a certain ministry.</p>
<p>This minister was a curious person. In the fourth month of that year, he hastily set up a grand banquet and invited Wang the Sword Immortal to sit in the seat of honor, and invited several vice ministers to accompany him. During the banquet, everyone urged Wang the Sword Immortal to show off his swordsmanship and show his skills. Wang the Sword Immortal was not modest at all, but said that although he knew a little about swordsmanship, his skills were too shallow and he didn't dare to try it rashly. If something dangerous happened, it would be a disservice to everyone's sincerity. So everyone repeatedly asked him to try. Wang the Sword Immortal said, "The matter of trying the sword can wait for another day. I have lived in the mountains for a long time and am used to running. Today, after the meal, I will compete with you once, with the Biyun Temple in the Western Hills as the goal. You can take cars first, and I will follow on foot. Whoever arrives at the temple first wins." Everyone agreed. After the meal, the vice ministers all took their cars and drove quickly towards Biyun Temple.</p>
<p>Who knew that after the meal, Wang the Sword Immortal slowly returned to his residence, closed the door, and paced back and forth in the room. There were many male and female servants outside the residence, whispering and peeking into Wang the Sword Immortal's room, watching which road he would take and how he would walk. Unexpectedly, they never saw Wang the Sword Immortal walk out of the room. They only heard him pacing back and forth for about twenty minutes, and then there was no sound. They guessed that he must have fallen asleep in the afternoon.</p>
<p>Here, the ministers and vice ministers of each ministry, sitting in cars, quickly drove to Biyun Temple. When they arrived at the temple gate, Wang the Sword Immortal was walking slowly with the abbot of Biyun Temple, welcoming them out. Wang the Sword Immortal said with a smile, "I've been here for quite a while. Why are your cars so slow?" Everyone got out of the car, marveling at the sight. Later, when Vice Minister Luo returned home, he asked the servants in detail how Wang the Sword Immortal had walked. The servants recounted the situation at the time and said that they had not seen him walk out. So they concluded that Wang the Sword Immortal was either flying or using earth magic to escape.</p>
<p>These two stories both happened in the Republic of China era. Mr. Chu's soul did not disappear, and Wang the Sword Immortal's flight disappeared without a trace. People in Beijing at the time probably knew the general outlines, which shows that there are many strange things in the world. Mr. Chu was my colleague, and we had been together for more than seven years. His death was not strange, but it was unheard of for him to take a car to the ministry after his death. Wang the Sword Immortal's given name was "Hui." I don't know where he was from. After this competition, he knew that his fame was too great and he could no longer live there, so he hurriedly left Beijing and returned to the mountains of Gansu. Since then, I don't know where he is hiding, and there is no way to investigate. One is "flying has escaped the mortal path," and the other is "death is still ascending the puppet stage." The ancients said, "Half yin and half yang is 'human,' pure yang is 'immortal,' pure yin is 'ghost.'" People ascend to become immortals and descend to become ghosts. If we have good intentions, we ascend and can become immortals. If we have bad intentions, we descend and become ghosts. The distinction between good and evil is the distinction between yin and yang, which is also the distinction between immortals and ghosts. People cannot escape the two realms of yin and yang. I am afraid that Pu Songling did not know this truth either.</p>
<h3>Spring Dream</h3>
<p>— Zhang Yiqu</p>
<p>The market opens every seven days,</p>
<p>And dreams of my hometown return:</p>
<p>The forest mist seems to drip like dew,</p>
<p>The river water fragrant, not just the mountains.</p>
<p>Green algae, rice paddies, flower and willow paths,</p>
<p>Green vine thatch huts, bamboo fences, bays.</p>
<p>The scenery is of course good in my hometown,</p>
<p>But I cannot return to home or country.</p>
<h3>Reading</h3>
<p>— Qian Yajie</p>
<p>I remember the ancient temple east of the stream bridge,</p>
<p>The setting sun red in the shadows of green willows.</p>
<p>Several sounds of fisherman's flutes beyond the gray smoke,</p>
<p>A few woodcutter's songs in the evening mist.</p>
<p>Lofty ambitions gradually go with the flowing water,</p>
<p>Noble sentiments have followed the morning clouds into the sky.</p>
<p>A lifetime of infinite desolate feelings,</p>
<p>Lost at the end of the world with a broken swan.</p>
