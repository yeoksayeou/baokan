<h3 id="c1">總統重申戡亂決心　今將親主持紀念週致訓　接開中政委會檢討時局 <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>〔本報南京七日電〕蔣總統入日將親自主持國民黨中央紀念週及致訓，其內容在重申戡亂之決心及意義，共匪和平之謠傳不可相信，務希全國同胞能步調一致，以繼續戡亂軍事之完成。又紀念週後將舉行中央政委會，會中對時局問題亦將提出檢討。</p>
<p>「合衆社南京七日電」蔣總統將於八日上午發表軍要施政演說，闡明政府一貫戡亂到底之決心，同時，蔣總統將在外交·內政政策上有大刀闊斧之更張，並鬆弛其對政務之個人管理。消息靈通人士稱：總統八日在紀念週上發表此演說時，將呼籲全民敉平中共，並强調最後勝利之信心。政策之更改，據稱有下列三項：</p>
<p>（一）總統放寬其對全國政務之管理，使地區司令有全權處理軍事，不受干涉，並促使眞正之責任內閣之存在。</p>
<p>（二）政府對「官僚資本」及「豪門」採取强硬態度。</p>
<p>（三）對蘇外交强硬化，而與西方明確合作。</p>
<p>以上改變，據稱卽係監察院全體委員呈蔣總統之請願書之主題，請願書將於八日送呈總統，然後再行公布，同時「南京晚報」載稱，立法院長孫科刻正與立院委員會商應否由數立委赴美「求援」，該報稱，迄今尚未有定奪，以上發展均在蔣總統與黨政高級人員會談後發生。總統八日之重申戡亂決心，旨在冲淡中國知識份子要求和平之空氣，知識份子多人，在立委劉不同領導下，六日分別籲請蔣總統及毛澤東停止戰爭及組織多黨聯合政府·</p>

<p>〔中央社南京七日電〕京各大學敎授數十人，五日上書蔣總統，幷函毛匪澤東，呼籲和平，此間中央日報，七日發表社諭，加以駁斥，題爲「還在夢想求和嗎」，全文如次：</p>
<p>近來局部的軍事形勢不利，孤懸東北經年的國軍，遭受挫折，一般人民神經爲之緊張，這本是任何戰事過程一常有的現象，剿赤戰事自亦不能例外，而若千智識份子尤其是一小部分大學敎授，比之一般市民還要不鎭定，手忙脚亂，他們起而有所表示，表示什麼呢，唯一的法寶「呼籲和平」。</p>
<p>吾人深信大學敎授職司傳授知識，立於國民之首，人格高超，因而「呼籲和平」之動機，一定是出於憂國憂民，決非存心投機取巧。然而一究其「呼籲和平」之內容，則發覺彼等對於中國近百年來歷史的發展，以及中國當前局勢之眞象，寬若是之無所瞭解，竟若是之隔膜不明，殊屬出人意外。</p>
<p>中國今日的動亂，是由何而產生的呢，語云「事有必至，理有固然」的，年來西方列强挾其雄厚無比的經濟政治，與軍事力量向東侵略，適逢這個時候，中國社會之內在的「矛盾」，發展到飽和點，外力的作用，激發了內症，於是百年來內亂與外患，有如一對雙生子，一起產生，相互爲生，相互爲用，互相侵略，這古老的帝國底歷史生命，奄奄欲絕，在這極度艱危困苦的過程中，有識的知識分子，奮身而起，作革新救亡圖存的運動，康有爲，梁啓超諸先生，倡導變法維新運動於先，康梁六敗，孫中山先生繼起革命，辛亥以後，又有北伐運動，北伐以後，又有抗日戰爭，這些由知識份子領導的續業，都是要求實現國家獨立，政治自由與經濟平等的，吾人緬懷諸先進知識分子，對於民族國家之嚴肅的責任感及眼光的正確與遠大，以與今日相較，益增吾人景慕之情。</p>
<p>可是破壞的力量與爲中國求出路的力量，如魔鬼之跟蹤天使，形影不離，緊隨積極的肯定的變革遝動而俱起的，爲百年來起伏不斷的大小變亂，除洪楊之變以來，有苗民之亂，雲南之亂，關隴之亂，新疆之亂，現在則爲共黨之禍。共黨之禍，非偶然產生，乃中國社會內在的病症爲共產國際所利用而產生的·共黨之禍，也不自今日始，實由來已久，遠在一九二七年共黨從事所謂「蘇維埃運動」時，卽已開始。共黨從事「蘇維埃運動」凡十年之久，結果一敗塗地，流竄西北奄奄一息，繼藉抗日爲名，死灰復燃，利用入年抗日戰爭所形成的國脈虛脫，民窮財盡和社會動亂，目前的情形，是共產國際旣定政策之表現，是共黨欲求實現藉暴力刧奪國家政權，以建立「無產階級獨裁」制之目的之具體步驟，事勢底本質，旣然如此，空口「呼籲和平」，豈不爲共產政洽陰謀家所竊笑。</p>
<p>若干知識份子，惑於甘前的表面現象，未能透過表面的現象，而洞察事物之底裘，將政治不良與國家所應走的道路，混爲一談，他們以爲目前國家之動亂，係由於政權之爭奪，須知今日吾人與共黨停戰，非關政權之轉移，而實關國家是否獨立，民族是否自出，文化傳統是否延續，假設萬一不幸共黨得逞其野心，那末中國一定繼東歐諸弱小國家之後，作强者底附庸，人民永被奴辱，不得自由，歷史與文化傳統，必然中斷。不獨如此，而且整個生活方式，將要改變。在目前剿共戰事最擊要的關頭「呼籲和平」，就是倡導投降的別名，倡導尋向共黨投降也就是贊成中國作外國底附庸，贊成人民永被奴辱，贊成不要中國底歷史與文化，以及整個改變生活方式。這是眞正有責任感和愛國愛民者之所當爲的嗎？</p>
<p>也許有人認爲目前人民痛苦之至，無論誰是誰非，都應停止戰事，讓人民得以蘇息，作這種主張的人，動機也許是善良的，可是在一方面缺乏價值判斷，在另一方面，不明瞭共黨底大質，與和平是絕對不相容的。</p>
<p>現在從事剿赤戰事，千萬人民流離失所，無數老百姓，生活陷入極度困苦的境地，這種現象，令人焦慮傷痛。然而這一方面，是由於共黨擴大變亂，肆意破壤所致，另一方面，是豪門財閥，藉政治之特殊關係造成。所以人民慘苦，只應歸咎於共黨與富豪之合作。一般而論戰事過程中慘苦現象，爲任何戰爭所難免。抗日戰爭中也有人民慘苦的現象，沒有許多人因此說不該該抗戰，因爲抗日是應爲的。剿赤在本質土同是抵抗外患，我們怎可因此就要求停止剿匪，藉「呼籲和平」，向共黨投降呢？</p>
<p>中國共產黨正如在許多國家裏有積極表現的共黨弟兄一樣，從它底理論到組織，根本是戰鬥性質的，共黨是赫拉京利圖斯底信徒，他們底哲學是「戰鬥唯物論」，中心主張是「階級鬥爭」組織澈頭澈尾是一戰鬥體，他們對黨內是「整風」「整肅」，對黨外是先示以恩寵籠絡而後逐步淸算「鬥爭」的。向這種充滿鬥爭本質的集團，希望和平豈非隊木求魚。這些知識份子，不過口頭喊喊和平而已，政府則曾以事實謀致和平。不獨以事實謀致和平，而且以血來換取和平。事實過去至多兩年，奈何健忘若此？抗日戰爭勝利之初，政府召開政治協商會議於前，頒佈整軍方案於後，又三下停戰命令，國軍挨打。且五人小組三人小組鬧個不淸，結果還是百華罔效，共黨利用這些機會渡過一個一個的軍事危機，擴張發展致成大禍，以共黨當日之勢力遠不及今日尚且如此毫無和平誠意，而在今日氣燄方張之時，希望共黨停止變亂實現和平，豈非白畫作夢。</p>
<p>知識分子應該對於國家民族有嚴肅的責任感，更應該自身對於現實底眞相和歷史底前途有正確的認識，拿眞知灼見，來指導時代。</p>

<h3 id="c18">上海今日舉行人口普查 <a href="#c18" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e18" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">18</a></h3>
<p>上海市今天開始戶口總淸查，淸查時刻爲下午九時起至次日上午二時，預計四小時內分區完成。這次口口總淸查，亦稱爲戶口普查，其動員之廣，規模之大，在我國近代戶政史上，尚屬創舉。上海市府當局處理戶口普查，計劃周密，準備充分，是值得市民稱道的。公佈普查時刻之先，市政府公佈「淸查戶口換發國民身份瞪及配購瞪實施綱要」一件，令飭各級主管曁市民一體遵行。淸查日之前數天，各保甲依戶口調查冊分發附有配購證之新國民身份證及索引卡，由各戶先行填寫，準備淸查時刻當塲核對發給新證，收回舊證。同時，對於參加普查人員予以訓練，授以戶政知識，吳市長潘議長等根據學理與事實，並先後向市民播講戶口普查意義，使市民更明白實施新政的意義。今天爲全市入口總淸查日，交通已實行管制，淸查入員也已動員，各甲各戶的人口，莫不家喻戶曉，於下午九時起保持靜止狀態，聽候淸查人員的光臨，這是一件很可喜的事。</p>
<p>戶口普查在行政上和學理上的意義，進步的國家已有事實表現，我國抗戰時期的昆明重慶，也有過輝煌的成就，本報十月年九日社論。曾詳加闡述。我們今天所要指出的，是目前動盪不安的上海，因戚受戰局變化和經濟危機的影響，大多市民的情緒是不安的，生活是紛亂的；在此種不安與紛亂的狀態下，實施一種攸關生計的新政，其效果自與平常時期不同。因此，我們希望當局和參加普查人員，曁全體市民，要以忍耐的心理，謹慎的方法，從容應付，熱心贊助，分別注意以下發點：</p>
<p>第一，人口普查是一種靜態統計，係以實際人口爲準繩，這在學理上統計上，是沒有任何疑義的。不過這次上海市人口普查重要目的是普查的同時換發新國民身份證，而國民身份證的法律根據，則爲新戶籍法。按戶籍法所指的戶口調查，是一種動態統計，它以法理入口爲準繩。今天舉行的戶口總淸查，原則上是注重「實際在塲人口」，卽實際人口，如果有戶籍有身份證而又經保甲確實證明外出或旅行者，希望亦能依戶籍法換發新證，以免法令發生扞格，市民發生向隅之感。這是一種技術上的活用，希望當局和淸查人員注意及之。</p>
<p>第二，國民身份證是公證人民屬籍和身份，以爲瞪明個人權利和義務，從而受法律的保障，政府的保護之一種公證物。這種制度在進步國家，施行良好，深切具有敎育意義和民權意義，希望上海市民不要誤解，轉生風波·「國民身份證聲明書」及證上的出生日及屬籍，關係個人權利義務，務要填寫確實，幷且要與過去申報戶籍的出生及國籍符合。役歷卽服行兵役及軍官（佐）役之謂，義務勞動卽服行工役之稱，關係個人之義務與行爲，務要塡寫確實，並需與服役證件符合，不可虛偽謊報，妨害役政推行·總之，市民的聲明要確實可憑，如有不瞭解的項目，可向保甲或淸查人員請求解釋，藉以符合確實信守的原則。第三，實施人口普查是爲了便利施政。上海市民對於身份瞪換發的重視，是受了一四四張購物證所炫惑，每一市民均期望領得新證後，卽可憑證購買民生日用品。據聞限價取消後，配售事宜並未完全打消，惟何日施行，一時難以確定。因此希望政府當局，於身份瞪換發後，立卽考慮實施配售事宜，以免市民失望，而影響爾後任何新政之實施。不然的話，這次換發身份證及發給配購證，便成爲一種行政浪費，徒受擾民之譏，此不可不察。</p>
<p>第四，辦理人口普查的目的，應該是單純的，絲亳不應牽涉其他，方可避免苛擾，庶幾爲新政留一較好印象於民間。自前外傳淸查之日將附帶調查「地下倉庫」，曾引起市民惶惶不安，後經民政局長發言否認，市民的惶惑心理纔消釋遇去。按人口普查是一種統計工作，這個統計工作教育工作的進行，不僅不應調查人民的財產與物資，甚且也不能妨害人民的自由，藉詞加以拘捕等等。這次上海畢行人口普查，市民莫不熱烈贊助，歡心支持，在動盪不安的局面下，是何等難得的事，希望良好的開始，而有良好的收塲，爲若難中的市民保留良好印象。</p>
<p>總之，人口普查是很重要的措施，政府和市民需要忍耐和謹慎，順利來完成這件工作，切勿發生枝節，轉生風波，這是我們再度呼籲的。</p>

<h3 id="c43">莫洛托夫演說措辭溫和　對杜魯門暗送秋波　斥共和黨導美採冒險政策　一般認蘇此項表示可能重啟和談門戶 <a href="#c43" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e43" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">43</a></h3>
<p>〔中央社莫斯科六日電〕蘇聯十月革侖卅一週年紀念慶祝大會，今晚七時在波爾學劇院中舉行，蘇政府全體要員如莫洛托夫·馬林可夫·伏羅希洛夫均曾出席，惟史建林並未到塲。</p>
<p>〔中央社莫斯科六日合衆電〕蘇外長莫洛托夫暗示美國之採取「侵略政策」，共和黨應尸其咎。若干人土相信，莫洛托夫此舉，意在爲冷戰開啓與杜魯門和平談判之門·莫氏演說稱，杜魯門之重獲當選，乃美人民反對共和黨公開侵略計劃之故。論及日本問題時，蘇外長稱，日本之戰爭工業須予「全部消滅」。又稱，對日德和約之遲遲不能訂定，蘇聯殊爲不滿，而對德國之局勢，蘇聯更不能熟視無睹也。因美英法三國傳正在德國扶植納粹領袖，恢復其舊日地位·此間外國觀察家認爲莫洛托夫此項演說頗爲和緩，演詞並未對西方國家作何新攻擊，此暗示東西兩世界之敵意可趨和緩。莫氏向聽講羣衆揭示下述七點：（一）史達林接見眞理報記者之談話，已爲愛好和平之人民指示一條粉粹反蘇陰謀之道路。（二）所謂西歐聯盟擬議中之大西洋聯盟，及可能出現之地中海聯盟，皆係侵略者作戰計劃之一部份。（三）因美英二國認爲渠等統治全球之勢已成，故柏林危機問題仍未解決。（四）英美正在德國恢復納粹之力量，並毀棄戰時之種種協定·（五）蘇聯在聯合國爲毀滅原子彈所作之努力，遭到西方盟國阻授，蘇聯主張大國裁軍三分之一之建議，已爲美英法中四國所否決。（七）馬歇爾計劃巳爲美建立若干市塲，使西歡各國在經濟上成爲美國之奴役．莫洛托夫又指責美國正在全球各地建立軍事根據地，並發問稱，美國之軍事預算，何以竟高出其戰前之十一倍。在內政方面，莫氏稱，蘇聯目前之工業生產已比一九四〇年戰前標準高出百分之十七，而蘇聯重工業亦巳能生產任何目前所需要之種種機械。農業之成功亦極爲顯著。</p>

<p>〔合衆社巴黎六日電〕據六日自權威方面獲悉，安理會中之中立國家，認爲四强之首有會晤之必要，以解決柏林危機。彼等相信，祗有杜魯門·艾德禮·居伊及史達林四人親自晤談，可能最後打破死結，此項會議可能亦處理其他嚴重問題，如原子能及德國之未來等。</p>
<p>聯合國企圖覓致妥協解決之努力，已一度因蘇聯施用否決權而被阻，一般認爲第二次之失敗，將決定此世界組織之命運。杜魯門總統之公開表示願意覓取未來對蘇談判之新基礎，可望對解決柏林問題中產生一致之企圖。中立國家亦已確定彼等之立塲，因彼等認爲東西雙方均無意發動戰爭，如能在不喪失顏而下妥協，則雙方均願讓步。</p>

<p>〔法國新聞社巴黎六日電〕法國專家現正準備將法方起草之大西洋公約原文，付印極爲忙碌，此項草約對卽將會商之大西洋公約將大有貢獻。據可靠方面消息，法國之草約其性質係白魯塞爾公約及里約熱內盧公約之折中產品。消息靈通方面强調稱，大西洋公約之最後形式，將緊於若干尚未經討論之點而定。公約中所規定之義務顯然將視簽約國之數目多少而具有伸縮性。大西洋公約之條文僅爲一種自由參加之表現，並非一切鄰近大西洋國家皆須受其約束，亦非一切非大西洋鄰近國家皆須排除在外之謂。此項計劃係根據上次在巴黎召開之白魯塞爾公約簽字國會議之決定而準備者。在此以後，西歐五國常設委會將對法國草約以及其他簽字國之草約加以審查，在常設委會獲致結論後，卽將與美加召開正式會議。</p>

<p>〔聯合社華盛頓七日電〕杜魯門總統今日携眷乘坐專機「獨立」號前往弗羅里達州凱威斯特休假。</p>
<p>〔聯合社弗羅里達州凱威斯特七日電〕社魯門總統定今日携眷蒞此休假，全市準備在熱歡迎。此爲總統第五次訪問本城，但性質與以前四次不同。</p>
<p>〔中央社華盛頓六日合衆電〕社魯門總統已擬訂一項一九五〇年會計年度緊縮支出之政策。據預算局局長魏勃稱：此項預算，將使聯邦開支减至最低可能水準。上項聲明宣佈前，杜魯門曾與內閣人員會商。國防部長福萊斯特爾於會中曾表示，渠不擬於政府繼續供職。一般估計一九五〇年之預算，約四百五十億元。魏勃稱：總統令渠遵循緊縮預算政策。</p>
<p>〔中央社華盛頓六日電〕杜魯門總統於其返回華府之次日，亦卽其度兩週休假之前，曾分別召見大批閣員。爲杜氏召見及請謁總統者，有代理國務卿羅維特，海軍部長蘇里文，預算局長魏勃，國防部長福萊斯特，商務部長沙仲爾，財政部長史奈特，羅維特與杜魯門晤談達半小時，此項會晤，被視爲最重要，尤因羅氏並未列入正式訪晤總統之名單中，而彼於白宮之偏門進出，避見記者，白宮與國務院，對於外交界猜測紛紜之際，所舉行之會晤，拒絕置評。按該項猜測，卽指蘇聯不顧共和黨與民主黨領袖，於選舉後呼翻對於外交問題之統一，巳集中力量，企圖擊破美國兩黨之外交政策。羅氏於總統外出之兩週中，有多項極重要之外交問題，均予擱置，待選舉結束後，再作決定。羅維特曾偕今日返美請示之駐英大使道格拉斯第二次訪晤杜魯門。同時國務院對於南京傳來之消息，卽馬歇爾曾保證今後將改變國務院援華之冷談態度一節，未置評論·接近杜魯門之人士稱：杜魯門甚願馬歇爾決定繼續蟬聯，杜氏認爲馬鄕爲一偉大之國務鄕。</p>

<p>據上海金管局發表：上海金融管理局前派大批稽核人員，前往京滬沿綫蘇州·武進·無錫·鎭江等地檢查各該地銀行錢莊，以及其他金融機構業務，現已分別檢杳載事，所有全部檢查報告，經該局詳加審核，按其情節輕重，分別核擬處分，幷已於本月五日陳准督導員裁定。計此次該局檢查之行莊甚多，包括省銀行·縣銀行·商業銀行錢莊·信用合作社·地下錢莊等五類，被檢查之家數，計省銀行總行一家，及其分支行四家，縣銀行四家，商業銀行入家，錢莊廿五家，信用合作社十四家，地下錢莊三家，共五十九家·除信用合作社地下錢莊部份另行發表外，茲先將省銀行縣銀行商業行莊之檢杳結果及其處分情形，簡列如后：</p>
<p>商定行莊違法情節</p>

<p>〔本報特寫〕暖室裏的鮮花，宮殿中的驕子，當他們置身在華貴洋化的學府門內，連做夢也不會想到被摒棄在學府門外的一羣勞工，爲了要讀書，每天經過十二小時疲勞工作後，還願打起精神來，到勞工夜校去上課。</p>
<p>中華基督敎女靑年會，爲了滿足勞工的求知愁，在本市創辦了六所女工夜校，三所在滬西，設在曹家渡，小沙渡路一帶，三所在滬柬，設在楊樹浦一帶，都是工廠密佈地區，免費供給女工們精神上的糧食，也早已成了女工的第二家庭！</p>
<p>女工夜校創辨迄今已有二十餘年歷史，它是專爲女工而設的，一切都爲了女工，上課時間，每晚七時至九時，和她們的工作不衝突，而且時間可有伸縮性，學生中如有輪到做夜工的，敎帥並在第二天早晨爲她們補課，使她們的成績不致落後，而那些女工，個個都是勤習的好學生，她們在通宵苦工後，不吃飯，不睡覺，還願在翌晨拖着疲勞的身子，　數起精神，進自己的學校上課去。在夜校讀書的女工，赴學生的模範，她們從不遲到，不早退，不輕易缺課，守秩序，也　禮貌。</p>
<p>教材切合實用</p>
<p>女工夜校施與的是成人敎育，也可以說是識字敎育，是實際的，合用的，在「學以致用」的前題下，敎村由女靑年會全國協會自編。女工夜校共分三班初級，中級，高級。每級學二期，三年畢業。敎學以國語爲主體，通常小學敎材中最令人頭痛的龜兎賽跑四則應用題早被淘汰了，替而代之的是初級珠算，無疑遺在女工是要實用得多了。在夜校畢業的女工，其國文程度每每超過小學畢業生，可以續報，看淺近的書籍，和寫普通信件了。</p>
<p>經費莫捐得來</p>
<p>此外，勞工夜校的最顯著的特點，是師生情感的融洽，它不單是一所學校，而是一個家庭。敎師猶如家長，敎學生識字，也爲她們解決切身問題，偶爾有學生缺課了，先生必親往訪問，看看是不是病倒了，或是發生了意外，眞是所謂師生打成一片，學生愛這所夜校，如同每個人愛自己的家那樣。女工夜校的經費取自女靑年會，而女靑年會經費是向社會募捐得來的，所以每屆女靑年會舉行募捐大會時，女工部總是第一個熱烈響應。而且募捐結束時，歷屆團體獎狀總屬之女工部，在募捐期間，她們會興奮得睡不着覺，整日奔走，寶貴的成績是由一角二角血汗錢累積而成的。</p>
<p>盼望社會援助</p>
<p>現在女工夜校讀書的女工，總計九百餘人，這已經達六所學校所能容納的飽和點了。但是每當學期伊始時，總有大批新生請求入學，這可以看出，生活剝奪了她們求學的權利，工作佔去了她們讀書的時間，雖然留下了僅餘的二小時，而她們企求識字的慾望，依然很高。但是，女靑年會因限於學額，終於不得不忍心的看她們失望而去。</p>
<p>女靑年會數年來一直希望把女工夜校加以擴充，但終因限於經費而未能如願。這一次，女靑年會第四十屆募捐大會業已揭幕，她們盼望本屆募捐能够有意外的收獲，那麼勞工部計劃再增闢一所女工夜校，爲女工們造福。這是掃除文盲的實際工作，是最有意義的慈善事業，願有識之士加以扶助！</p>
<p>染織業續辦配布　專配門莊，報價核配</p>

<h3 id="c83">一般物價　市塲做開極少　物價直綫上升 <a href="#c83" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e83" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">83</a></h3>
<p>自財政經濟緊急處分令的頒行實施兩月餘的限價，終因運用不當，配合失綢，造成搶購風潮，彌漫全國，物資藏匿，十店九空。當局在嚴重的氣氛下，不得不有補充辨法的規定，補充辨法的要點計有：</p>
<p>（一）糧貪依照市價安易，自由運銷。（二）紗布，糖，煤，鹽，由中央主管機關核本定價，統籌調節，其他重要物品，包括民生日用品及工業原料，授權地方政府，參酌供應情形，依核本定價之原則，加以管理。（三）公用及交通事業，應核計成本，由主管官署核定調整價格。（四）文武職公敎人員待遇，參照生活之必需，酌予調整。（五）工資參照維持工人生活之需要，酌予調整。（六）關於貨物稅及其他從價征收之稅捐，應依稅法，參加物價，調整征收。　自新經濟方案的頒行，至十一月一日補充辨法的公布，爲時正好七十天。我們覺得是：（一）限價政策事實上已全部放棄了。（二）改革幣制的功效也多半給毀了。（三）在經濟上是一個一百八十度的大轉變，一切幾乎回復到法幣時代原狀。（四）依照限價出售貨物的商人，以及奉公守法兌換金鈔的市民，頓然遭受一筆莫大的損失。（五）展望今後的經濟狀况將益發困難，不知當局何以善其後？何以安撫遭受損失的大多數善良人民。</p>
<p>上週全國交通事業，在兩月來的限價桎梏下，紛紛調整新價，計；（一）自五日起輸船客貨運價一律上漲四倍，以台幣計算者漲百分之一百二十。（二）自七日起鐵路客運價漲五倍，貨運價漲一倍。（三）國內平信每封擬漲爲一角，電報每字漲爲四角，待完成立法程序後實行。（四）本市人大公用事業價格卽將調整，其中水電，煤氣，電話等項，尚有自一日起追加之說。　上週市塲物價趨勢，因限價開放，有如獲得解放一般，週初因措手不及，核議定價，尚少做開。遞中以後，則喊價混亂，成直綫性瘋狂上漲。首先我們來說紗布，紗布因補充辦法規定，須由中央核本定價，在中央核定前，本市只有堪外喊價一種，久違的四十支藍鳳牌棉紗，於週二首次塲外呌價爲三千九百元，以後一路躍進，週五竟一度破萬元大關，站定於九千五百元，週末再創一萬二千元之高價。廿一支雙馬則由週二之二千二百元步漲至週末之七千三百元收市。龍頭細布週二喊價爲九十元，連續上升，週五一日之間，竟由一百八十元跳到二百五十元，週末續登三百一十元高峯。</p>
<p>糧食於週一開市，上白粳議價爲八十元，但因產價高漲，議價不能生效，週末又趨停市，暗盤飛漲。</p>
<p>雜糧漲勢猖獗，油粉未做開，但塲外喊價則騰升不已，週五豆油喊價五百五十元，生菜油五百元。粉市週三雜牌粉喊價三十一元，週末兵船粉喊價七十三元。　日用品如烟皂火柴等，均於高峯上連續上升，尚無停歇狀態。總之，上週市塲物價上升之猛，卽法幣時代亦望塵莫及。若干商品於議價開出後，隨又重行議價，好像是對兩月來限價高壓的一個大反動。　關於金圓券發行的數額，根據金圓券發行準備監理委負會第三次檢查公告，截至十月三十一日止，共發行金圓券一，五九五，三八六，六九一·〇〇元，這此九月底的發行額金圓券九五六，七五二，四九四·四〇元，增加了六三八，六三四，一九六·六〇元，上升約百分之六十七。金圓券發行額如此劇增，物價狂漲不已，政府收支益發難以平衡，實逼處此，又要回到惡性通貨膨脹的舊路了。</p>
<h3 id="c84">貨幣金融　北資南來頭寸漸旺　人心振奮暗息高昂 <a href="#c84" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e84" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">84</a></h3>
<p>上週本市銀根，在前半週仍表現出非常緊倘的局面。週一起當局決定取消限價而改用議價的方法，這無異給久疲的人心一付興奮劑，市塌上都覺得，從此物價就可大漲特漲，於是行莊存款，被提一空，造成業內空前的缺單恐慌，行莊在無可奈何之下，祗有藉業外頭寸的掉借或現鈔的抵補來應付這恐慌的局面，然而業外人心亦決不示弱，儘管銀根緊俏，物價跳上幾倍，市塲上搶進的風氣仍極一時之盛，這樣就便宜了資金的擁有者，眼看暗息一個高峯又一個高峯，週四那天，市間貨幣貼息竟高達九角，普通階息亦喊至六角開外，對於銀錢業眞是一重不可抗拒的打擊·雖說行莊利率，從週二起，業經數度請求而調整爲存息六分，欠息一角入，與同業拆放一角五分，但比起暗息來，仍是瞠乎其後，行莊在頭寸紛告出龍聲中，不啻變成了客戶的轉帳機關，上週曾一度謠傳某幾家行莊有不穩的消息，雖然事後證明並未出什麼亂子，但銀錢業處境的窘迫，亦可想而知了。　到了下半週，金融界的情形就迥然不同，這是可以想像得到的，東北陷落，華北已輕遭受空前嚴重的威脅，於是素以敏惑著稱的資金，亦就滔滔南下，尋求牠們的避難所了。這可就暫時鬆和了本市銀根拮据的局面，業內缺單的情形，普見好轉，週四起退票金額亦减少，現鈔籌碼，亦已不如過去緊絀。　上週暗息，迭見高峯，週一普，通做四角入分，到週三，五角四分的拆息己經常見，最高甚至有做六角以外者。貨幣貼息，週二爲四角八分，但週四憶真升至九角，週五雖以北方遊資抵達，貨幣貼息，仍站七角五分，其他貼息，亦做六角左右。</p>
<p>國家行局交換情形，上半週因稅款等收入，頗有差進，這自然又加劇了銀根的緊勢，下半週，行局反進爲出，週四甚至差出了幾百萬元，而據說，當局已在攷慮恢復國家行局交換差額的公佈。記得在限價期間，當局所以禁止國家行局公佈交換差額，大概是爲了避免鉅額差出數字刺激看漲的人心的緣故，現在假如恢復公佈差額數字，可能是利用拋售物資下的鉅額差進數字給予看漲的人心一個反刺激，果爾，則不遠的將來，國家行局可能有連續的鉅額差進。</p>
<p>上週內匯匯率，仍保持千分之廿四的最高限價匯率，除了實際上的匯率與限價頗有出入外，上週國家行局的內匯率也在醞釀調整之中。</p>
<p>外匯匯率，當局曾一再否認亦有開放之說，對出口事業據說用出口貸款來加以支持，至於如何增加僑匯，尚無具體的辦法可稽·香港外匯行市尚少波動。黃金每華兩，週一爲三〇五·五港元，週二爲三〇六港元，週四則再上升半元。美鈔市價週一爲五·二六元，週二一度落至五·二四元，週四則回升至五·二六元。</p>
<h3 id="c85">熊式輝在南昌　談戰局與贛情　預示三年底或明年春　世界將發生驚人事件 <a href="#c85" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e85" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">85</a></h3>
<p>— 本報記者　劉藻</p>
<p>〔本報南昌五日快訊〕熊式輝氏日前由京返贛，道經九江時，曾赴牯嶺小住，到達南昌後，曾出席省參議會的茶會與省垣各界擴大紀念週，並且曾一度應正在爲改選主委而鬧糾紛的國民黨省黨部的招待會。熊氏在每次的集會上，都强調國軍目前態勢非如一般杞憂之士的悲觀，而且他認爲今年底，至遲明年春，世界上又要發生更驚人的事件，到那時中國的局面，當然要由獨力支持與匪軍的搏鬥而成爲全世界主持正義而戰爭的一股主流。</p>
<p>軍事家的看法</p>
<p>他說：最近國軍在長春的放棄，濟南的失守，以及鄭州·開封的相繼撤退，大家便以爲共匪在遂步接近成功的境地，認爲國軍的軍紀大壞，士氣不振，其實不然，長春·濟南，在目前的軍事形勢上，早已成爲孤島，只要匪軍願意不惜犧牲的死拼，我們取得相當代價之後，是可以放棄的。</p>
<p>開封與鄭州的撤退，他以軍事家的看法，認爲在軍事意義上，亦毫不爲奇，因爲過去我們的失敗，就是由於軍事受了政治的牽制，擊如：上次開封失守，河南的國代立監委，以及地方人士都向中央請願增援，結果國軍爲顧全政治上的民意，致令戰略陷於被動，處處駐兵，處處薄弱，處處挨打，猶如耶穌被釘在十字架上，手足動彈不得。</p>
<p>主動捕捉戰機</p>
<p>現在，我們的戰略，已經改變過來，開封等地雖已撤退，但我們可以機動地調動軍隊，增强戰力，適應我們戰略上的需要，自可主動的捕捉戰機，加以殲滅匪軍。　熊氏復將國軍與匪軍的實力，作了一段槪括的比較，來引證今後的戰事與最後的勝利，他說：就匪我的陸海空軍整個兵力觀察，無疑是國軍佔着絕對優勢，專就陸軍而言，在東北匪我兵力相當，華北則國軍佔優勢，華中華南更不待言。過去國軍是處處佈兵，處處被動，現在這種呆板的戰略己經完全改正過來，熊氏更引證總統在中央公開宣佈的話，來諭斷今後的戰局，認爲共產集團不能領導世界，而中共是共產集團的一條尾巴，當然更無在中國成功的可能。</p>
<p>達成戡建基地</p>
<p>談到江西的情形，熊氏强調胡家鳳主席的人格，經驗與學識，認爲江西是能使成爲戡亂的基地，建國的前鋒，但是，他對於江西各縣盛行的械鬥與派系鬥爭，認爲這是阻碍江西前進與人民的致侖傷。</p>
<p>他說：現在江西一般人想到匪軍揚言渡江，就懷着不必要的過度恐慌，這是一種錯誤心理，從軍事部署上看，他更說明目前江西的防務，是有備無患，因爲東有衢州綏署，西有長沙綏署，北有華中剿總，南有廣州綏署，省境四週皆有愼密的軍事部署，我們只要自己努力組訓民衆，充實日衛武力，精練團隊，使無形之匪，潛伏不住，有形之匪流竄不入，就盡了保安責任，更應對國家盡到戡亂義務，例如：國家需要兵員，我們有人就出兵，國家需要糧，我們有糧就應該出糧，我們希望匪禍不重演在江西，就應出兵，出糧，盡地方應盡的戡亂責任，更要撲滅各縣的械鬥與派系鬥爭，一切爲了人民，一切爲了戡建，今後的江西，就能成爲戡亂的基地，建國的前鋒。</p>

<h3 id="c87">從「沸淇淋」說起 <a href="#c87" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e87" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">87</a></h3>
<p>— 索見</p>
<p>今年夏天，許多人吃不起冰洪淋，便買冰淇淋粉，但買了粉，又無法製成冰淇淋，便只好開水一冲，嚐一下熱烘烘的「沸淇淋」，却無人嫌此「沸淇淋」不冰，且莫不贊歎「味旣可口，質料亦佳」；到如今，許多人吃不起牛奶，便聊以自慰地說「冰淇淋粉可代牛奶，比牛奶好吃，且不費糖」，又有許多嬰兒的母親，因爲魚肉價昂，奶水日漸枯竭，於是也爭相以冰淇淋粉權充奶粉，以哺嬰孩。姑不諭冰淇淋粉成份，殊不足以替代奶粉，但總可勉充嬰兒之饑，蓋冰洪淋粉起初價錢頗賤，薪水階級的父母，勉可負担。</p>
<p>但是，政府對這批堆積已久的友邦廉價「讓予」的物資，偏偏從不加以統籌分配，以惠薪給階層，却任他源源不斷地流入「牛黨」手中，大半巳散置馬路兩旁，天天漲價，獲取高利；直到搶購風潮爆發，「薪水階級」奄奄一息的時候，政府才記起了已經剩餘無幾的剩餘物資，說是實行配給。雖然所剩已無多，半數且發霉，但至少可以救救一部份公敎人員的急需，由是許多人拿了配購證莫不喜形於色，對於政府過去不斷任其走私，浪費，發霉的「罪過」，也都無人加以追究。我國公敎人員及一般薪給階級對當局的寬厚原宥眞是無以復加！</p>
<p>那知道：限價開放以後，物價連跳七八級，許多價格相繼「奉令」調整，而公敎待遇尚在擬議改善，准加一倍有半，等拿到新待遇已是十一月底或十二月初；正當這個當兒，物資供應局已於數日前宣告了關門漲價，讓公敎人員僅有的些微「便宜」，都遭剝削！舉世各國，古今中外，對公敎人員及薪給階層的苛刻虐待，恐無出其右者！天下間，事之不公，理之不平，恐亦以物資供應局此次舉措爲登峯造極！</p>
<p>政府！我要問你：剩餘物資可以任其霉爛，又可以聽其造福黃牛黨，難道就不可便宜賣給奄奄一息闔家饑餓的公敎人員嗎？</p>
<h3 id="c88">催眠麻醉法 <a href="#c88" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e88" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">88</a></h3>
<p>— 毛毅</p>
<p>由於麻醉藥供應的缺乏，迫使新加坡附近的一個戰俘醫院的醫生山庇曼和伍屈勒夫試以催眼術代替麻醉劑。他們決定先選牙科和外科的病症試用催眠術。</p>
<p>施行催眠術時，呌病人仰臥在優子上。所採用的方法是一種「聚神疲勞法」，呌病人固定的凝視着一枝鉛筆的頂端，鉛筆與眼睛的距離極近，近到如果再進一點便反而看上去糢糊不淸了。這種方法是傑姆士。布雷德醫生在一入四零年左右首創的，稱這種方法爲催眠術的便是他。他的主要的目的是使病人進入一種「暗示的狀態」，以便治療各種疾病。</p>
<p>在山庇曼和伍屈勒夫的病人中，有二十三個人是拔牙齒的。在其他的病案中，包括移除指甲和對化膿的創傷切割與排水。</p>
<p>催眠者於催眠之際，對病人口頭上保證在動手術時和動手術之後都不會感覺到痛苦，且在事後也不會記得道次手術，這是一件重要的事。如果病人在動手術之後感覺到痛苦，不是由於催眼者忽略了適當的暗示，便是由於在第一次暗示造成之後喚醒病人太快（卽是不到十分鐘）。</p>
<p>在十七世紀中葉，有人將一隻鷄的雙足紮住，放在地上，等牠停止掙扎之後，在牠的眼前用粉筆劃一條筆直的綫，便能使牠被催眠着，一動也不動。但是一般人總還對這種手術不大信任，有一位學者竟因實用催眠術而在一入三八年被迫辭去倫敦大學的醫科講席。</p>
<p>山伍兩醫生的成功推翻了過去的偏見。現在是澈底的檢討催眠術與暗示性對外科醫術的關係的時候了。</p>
<h3 id="c89">記梁巨川先生 <a href="#c89" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e89" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">89</a></h3>
<p>— 清華</p>
<p>在一片搶購排隊與紛惶的景象中，不知怎地，叫我想起這一位死已三十多年的老先生來·他就是在一九一八（民國七年）陰曆十月初七日晨自沈死於常時北京積水潭的桂林梁濟（巨川），梁漱溟的爸爸。</p>
<p>他的死，一般編著什麼近代史的人都含混地說他是殉淸朝，好像有些斷章取義，沒有耐心研察他那長達六十餘頁的多封遣書。他的死，又一度成爲新舊文北震盪衝擊間的一塲大論戰。用我們今日的眼光平心靜氣地說，他的死似乎可以說是最忠於民國乃至忠於民主的極端表現。譬如說，他眼見民國肇興，舊道德崩潰了，新道德朱發明，「達官時彥，提倡賭博，女閭，種種荒嬉，風靡一時，轉相　扇」，「改革官僚，最失機會。………各部重新組織，不先以品誼節槪爲衡，依然煦煦噢咻，惟位置私人是計」，最早原訂不論位置概支生活費六十元者，後來却一再潤澤，薈成利藪，這種地方使他痛恨袁世凱和號爲「智庵」的袁幕大將內閣總理趙秉鈞。（趙也是刺宋敎仁案的要角，後傳爲項城毒斃·）梁老先生是個重安寗守法紀的好公僕，他也曾做民國的官吏，却還守着淸末咸同時的舊現矩，除了在辦公處所不私見上官，故未嘗干謁趙，只在臨死仍發表　一封寫給趙秉鈞，冀其憬悟的舊信。雖然有些近於「與虎謀皮」，遺書封面註明叫人打電話告訴當軸知道：「云巨川留公函而死」。</p>
<p>他在決定一死以殉，「明知大勢難救，而捐此區區，以聊爲國性一綫之存」的時候，心裏尚非常憧憬於民初開國的國會，幾次問兒輩國會何時纔開。「不料癸丑（一九一三）國會開後一般議員乃全非素日心中想望之議員，全不以救民救國爲心，搗亂行私，不成事體」，這樣纔斷了他親赴國會「以民生國計墾切陳詞」的一念·他的自殺，正是要想震　振　，決不爲個人什麼沽名釣譽。他曾經慨乎其言地說：我這一把年紀，再活一二十年，也不過天天聽聽戲，喫館子，雖然與世無爭，却又於國何補？原來這位老先生還是淸末提倡新劇的一人，曾編過「女子愛國」劇本於光緒丙午（一九〇六）在京師上演，是採的魯漆室女憂魯的故事·他平素認爲「日聚千百人而面命之無逾劇塲」，所以極注重它深刻的教育性。</p>
<p>這老先生是位決定聰明，心細如髪，思想縝密，觀察入微的人。全部遺書，密字細註，鈎畫圈點，眞可以說是盡反覆叮嚀，纏綿凄切之致。尤其可以令人感歎的是，他寫這些篇文字，時間長約五六載，每有空暇，卽閉戶疾書，忽然有事擱置（有一次是電燈公司開會），也在紙上說明，得暇再續，經常鎖藏在屜內，秘密着不令人知。據他自記，「癸丑甲寅次女時露防察」，居然數年之後，依舊令他克償素願，真是死得從容極了！</p>
<p>他的遺書有影寫本·一九四〇年鄙人在港初晤梁漱溟，曾詢以此冊似可重印，漱溟爲之愀然。敢情此書外間已很罕觀了。昔人云聞　鼓而思將帥，我們却在這個不遑寗處的苦悶時期，忽地提起巨川先生來，自然是緬懷他那對人生的毫不茍且的熊度。咸斯</p>

<p>美海軍剩餘物資中，有一種是鹹水（海水）用的肥皂，無人顧問，擱置頗久，後來被加薩白朗加的一家公司全部買下，據說，用道種肥皂來洗滌多蚤的駱駝，極有用處。</p>

<h3 id="e1">President Reaffirms Determination to Suppress Rebellion; Will Personally Preside Over Memorial Week and Deliver Instructions Today; To Convene Central Political Committee Meeting to Review the Current Situation <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 7th] President Chiang will personally preside over the Kuomintang Central Memorial Week and deliver instructions. The content will reaffirm the determination and significance of suppressing the rebellion, emphasizing that rumors of peace with the communists are not to be believed. It is hoped that all compatriots nationwide can act in unison to continue the military campaign to complete the suppression of the rebellion. Following the Memorial Week, a meeting of the Central Political Committee will be held, during which the current situation will also be reviewed.</p>
<p>["United Press, Nanjing, 7th"] President Chiang will deliver a major policy speech on the morning of the 8th, clarifying the government's consistent determination to suppress the rebellion to the end. At the same time, President Chiang will make sweeping changes in diplomatic and domestic policies, and loosen his personal management of political affairs. Well-informed sources say that when the President delivers this speech at the Memorial Week on the 8th, he will call on the entire nation to quell the Chinese Communists and emphasize confidence in final victory. The policy changes are said to include the following three items:</p>
<p>(1) The President will relax his management of national political affairs, giving regional commanders full authority to handle military affairs without interference, and promoting the existence of a true responsible cabinet.</p>
<p>(2) The government will take a tough stance against "bureaucratic capital" and "powerful families."</p>
<p>(3) Foreign policy towards the Soviet Union will be hardened, and cooperation with the West will be clearly defined.</p>
<p>The above changes are said to be the subject of a petition submitted to President Chiang by all members of the Control Yuan. The petition will be submitted to the President on the 8th and then made public. At the same time, the "Nanjing Evening News" reported that Sun Ke, President of the Legislative Yuan, is currently discussing with the Legislative Yuan Committee whether a number of legislators should go to the United States to "seek assistance." The newspaper said that no decision has been made so far. The above developments occurred after President Chiang held talks with senior party and government officials. The President's reaffirmation of his determination to suppress the rebellion on the 8th is intended to dilute the atmosphere of peace demanded by Chinese intellectuals. Many intellectuals, under the leadership of legislator Liu Butong, appealed to President Chiang and Mao Zedong on the 6th to stop the war and form a multi-party coalition government.</p>
<p>[United News Agency, Nanjing, 7th] It is learned that President Chiang summoned Zhang Zhizhong and Sun Ke for a meeting on the morning of the 7th before going to church with his wife for worship. All parties are now eagerly awaiting the President's report on the current situation during the Memorial Week on Monday.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 7th] Premier of the Executive Yuan, Weng Wenhao, met with the President on the morning of the 7th to make a report. The President again expressed his intention to retain him in person regarding his resignation. It is learned that Weng's intention to resign has not changed, but while on indefinite leave, he will continue to be responsible for the affairs of the Executive Yuan until a new cabinet is formed. It is also learned that if Weng insists on resigning and cannot be retained, the party is still said to favor Zhang Qun as his successor, but Zhang has not yet expressed any consideration to accept the position.</p>

<p>Executive Yuan's Reply to the Legislative Yuan</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 7th] The Executive Yuan replied to the Legislative Yuan regarding the inquiry made by a member of the Legislative Yuan on October 10th about the reason for handling the stocks of Shanghai Yangzi Jianye Company. According to the telegram and attachments dated the 29th from the Shanghai District Management and Supervision Office, Yangzi Company reported its inventory for registration on September 25th (the first day of the city-wide general registration and inspection of daily necessities in Shanghai). The office then handed it over to the Municipal Police Bureau for inspection, and after the police station reported the inspection results, it requested the bureau to handle it in accordance with the provisions of the general registration and inspection method, and to deal with any violations according to law. As for the inventory of Yangzi Company, the competent authorities have been notified to allocate and sell them to various manufacturers and general commercial firms at limited prices in accordance with the regulations. According to the reporter, this telegram was issued before the announcement of the supplementary measures for management and the abandonment of limited prices. The inventory list of Yangzi Company sealed on October 1st attached to the telegram includes more than 60 items of goods, including 2,563 boxes of Western medicine, 38 boxes of daily necessities, 93 boxes of cosmetics, 13 boxes of women's leather shoes, and 168 handbags. According to the police station's report, the inspection results showed that all the inventories, except for the boxed items that were difficult to count, were the same as the inventory list. The report also stated: "Some of the medicines (more than 1,000 boxes) are stored in an air-conditioned room, and some of the cod liver oil, etc., have deteriorated, but the storage time has been more than a year." As for the news reported that a large batch of Western medicines and cars belonging to Kong Lingkan were found in the 13-story building, it is said that "it was a mistake that it was the warehouse of Yangzi Company on the second floor of Liwei Automobile Company."</p>

<p>[Our Beiping Correspondent, 7th] Hu Shi gave a speech at the Hebei Provincial Government monthly meeting on the 7th, commenting on the US election, saying that Truman's victory is Trumanism's victory, and it has a great impact on the world. He believes that in the future, countries that love freedom can obtain US assistance and engage in struggles with countries that oppose freedom. Hu also believes that the American people's nostalgia for Roosevelt's New Deal and Truman's expression of continuing the spirit of the "New Deal" are the basic factors for Truman's victory. On the other hand, Truman's victory today is the result of continuous struggle over the past three years.</p>

<p>[United Press, Washington, 7th] Diplomacy experts said on the 7th that, contrary to outside criticism, President Truman supports effectively assisting China to avoid falling into the hands of the communists. Observers said that communism recognizes the United States as its greatest enemy, and the Communist Party is now attacking non-communist governments around the world. Truman and Congress, in view of this, will inevitably adopt a consistent policy of deterring communism. Some observers believe that, in the case of China, the US anti-communist policy may include assisting China in restoring its territorial integrity, including the recovery of the Northeast.</p>
<p>They pointed out that the United States is doing this partly because of the traditional US advocacy of China's right to independence and territorial integrity, and partly because the Northeast is a treasure trove of raw materials, and the restoration and development of the entire East depends on it.</p>

<p>[Our Beiping Correspondent, 7th] After Commander-in-Chief's journey south and return north, what changes will there be in the major plans for military and political affairs in North China? Because Fu and his associates are speaking cautiously, it has not yet become clear. It is only heard that after Fu returned, he once told people that after the military defeat in the Northeast, the situation in North China has become more serious than before, but if all sectors in North China can work together, it is an excellent opportunity to complete the suppression of the rebellion and build the country. It is rumored here that after the transmission south, the central government has made major decisions on North China. According to a certain newspaper: (1) The Hebei-Shandong-Liaoning Border Region Command is incorporated into the Northeast Suppression Headquarters, and the retreating national troops are incorporated into the North China region; (2) About 30% of US aid in military supplies will be directly transported north to equip Fu's elite troops, and the original weapons of Fu's troops will be allocated to a team for use to strengthen local forces. Another message: The overall war in North China will also be strengthened, and all military, political and economic affairs in North China will be guided and coordinated by Fu.

<h3 id="e17">"Still Dreaming of Seeking Peace?" The Capital Central Daily Refutes the "Appeal for Peace" Argument <a href="#e17" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c17" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">17</a></h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 7th] Several dozen professors from universities in the capital submitted a letter to President Chiang on the 5th, and also sent a letter to the Communist bandit Mao Zedong, appealing for peace. The Central Daily News here published an editorial on the 7th, refuting it, titled "Still Dreaming of Seeking Peace?" The full text is as follows:</p>
<p>Recently, the local military situation has been unfavorable, and the National Army, which has been isolated in the Northeast for many years, has suffered setbacks. The nerves of the general public are tense, which is a common phenomenon in any war. The suppression of the Communists is no exception. However, many intellectuals, especially a small number of university professors, are even more restless than ordinary citizens. They are flustered and take action. What do they express? The only magic weapon is "appealing for peace."</p>
<p>We firmly believe that university professors are responsible for imparting knowledge and stand at the forefront of the nation. Their personalities are outstanding. Therefore, the motivation for "appealing for peace" must stem from concern for the country and the people, and certainly not from a desire for opportunism. However, upon examining the content of their "appeal for peace," it is discovered that they are so ignorant of the historical development of China over the past century and the true state of the current situation in China, and so alienated and unclear, which is quite surprising.</p>
<p>What caused the turmoil in China today? As the saying goes, "Everything that happens is inevitable, and every reason has its justification." In recent years, Western powers have invaded the East with their incomparably strong economic, political, and military power. At this time, the internal "contradictions" of Chinese society have developed to a saturation point. The action of external forces has triggered internal problems. Thus, internal turmoil and external troubles have been like a pair of twins for a century, arising together, mutually generating each other, mutually benefiting each other, and mutually invading each other. The historical life of this ancient empire is on the verge of extinction. In this extremely difficult and painful process, knowledgeable intellectuals have risen up and launched reform and national salvation movements. Kang Youwei and Liang Qichao and other gentlemen advocated the Reform Movement first. After Kang and Liang failed six times, Sun Yat-sen continued the revolution. After the Xinhai Revolution, there was the Northern Expedition. After the Northern Expedition, there was the War of Resistance Against Japan. These successive undertakings led by intellectuals all aimed to achieve national independence, political freedom, and economic equality. We remember the serious sense of responsibility and the correct and far-sighted vision of the advanced intellectuals towards the nation, and comparing them with today, our admiration increases.</p>
<p>However, the forces of destruction and the forces seeking a way out for China are like demons following angels, inseparable, closely following the positive and affirmative changes. The great and small disturbances that have occurred constantly for a century, in addition to the Taiping Rebellion, include the Miao Rebellion, the Yunnan Rebellion, the Guanlong Rebellion, and the Xinjiang Rebellion. Now, there is the Communist Party disaster. The Communist Party disaster did not arise accidentally but was produced by the internal maladies of Chinese society being exploited by the Communist International. The Communist Party disaster did not begin today but has a long history, starting as early as 1927 when the Communist Party engaged in the so-called "Soviet Movement." The Communist Party engaged in the "Soviet Movement" for ten years, and as a result, it was utterly defeated and fled to the Northwest, on the verge of death. Later, under the guise of resisting Japan, it revived from the ashes, taking advantage of the exhaustion of the nation's vitality, the impoverishment of the people, the depletion of wealth, and the social unrest caused by the eight-year War of Resistance Against Japan. The current situation is a manifestation of the established policy of the Communist International and a concrete step in the Communist Party's attempt to achieve the goal of seizing national power by violence and establishing a "dictatorship of the proletariat." Since the essence of the situation is such, would it not be laughed at by Communist political conspirators to simply "appeal for peace"?</p>
<p>Some intellectuals are deluded by the current superficial phenomena, failing to see through the surface and discern the essence of things, confusing political shortcomings with the path the country should take. They believe that the current turmoil in the country is due to a struggle for power. It must be understood that today's armistice between us and the Communist Party is not about the transfer of power but about whether the nation is independent, whether the people are self-reliant, and whether cultural traditions continue. If, unfortunately, the Communist Party succeeds in its ambitions, then China will surely follow the weak and small countries of Eastern Europe and become an appendage of the strong, the people will be enslaved forever, without freedom, and historical and cultural traditions will inevitably be interrupted. Not only that, but the entire way of life will change. At the most critical juncture of the current suppression of Communists, "appealing for peace" is another name for advocating surrender. Advocating surrender to the Communist Party is also supporting China becoming an appendage of a foreign country, supporting the people being enslaved forever, supporting the abandonment of China's history and culture, and completely changing the way of life. Is this what those who are truly responsible and love the country and the people should do?</p>
<p>Perhaps some people believe that the people are currently suffering extremely, and regardless of who is right or wrong, the war should be stopped so that the people can rest and recuperate. The motivation of those who make this argument may be good, but on the one hand, they lack value judgment, and on the other hand, they do not understand the nature of the Communist Party, which is absolutely incompatible with peace.</p>
<p>Now, in the midst of the suppression of Communists, millions of people are displaced, and countless ordinary people's lives are plunged into extreme hardship. This phenomenon is worrying and distressing. However, on the one hand, it is due to the Communist Party expanding the unrest and wantonly destroying things, and on the other hand, it is caused by wealthy families and consortia using special political connections. Therefore, the people's suffering should only be blamed on the cooperation between the Communist Party and the rich. In general, the phenomenon of suffering during wartime is unavoidable in any war. There was also the phenomenon of people suffering during the War of Resistance Against Japan, but many people did not say that the War of Resistance Against Japan should not have been fought because the War of Resistance Against Japan was the right thing to do. The suppression of the Communists is essentially the same as resisting foreign aggression. How can we therefore demand an end to the suppression of Communists and surrender to the Communist Party by "appealing for peace"?</p>
<p>The Chinese Communist Party, like its Communist brothers who are actively active in many countries, is fundamentally combative in its theory and organization. The Communist Party is a follower of Heraclitus, their philosophy is "militant materialism," their central tenet is "class struggle," and their organization is a completely combative body. They use "rectification" and "purges" within the party, and show favor and win over outsiders before gradually settling scores and "struggling" against them. To hope for peace from such a group full of the nature of struggle is like climbing a tree to catch fish. These intellectuals are just shouting slogans of peace, while the government has tried to achieve peace with facts. Not only has it tried to achieve peace with facts, but it has also exchanged blood for peace. The facts of the past, at most two years, how can they be so forgetful? At the beginning of the victory of the War of Resistance Against Japan, the government convened a Political Consultative Conference first, promulgated a military reorganization plan later, and issued three ceasefire orders. The National Army was beaten, and the five-person group and the three-person group were in a mess. In the end, it was all in vain. The Communist Party used these opportunities to overcome one military crisis after another and expanded and developed into a major disaster. When the Communist Party's strength was far less than it is today, it still had no sincerity for peace. Now, when its arrogance is in full swing, to hope that the Communist Party will stop the unrest and achieve peace is like daydreaming in broad daylight.</p>
<p>Intellectuals should have a serious sense of responsibility for the nation, and they should also have a correct understanding of the true state of reality and the future of history, and use true knowledge and insight to guide the times.</p>

<h3 id="e18">Shanghai Holds Population Census Today <a href="#e18" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c18" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">18</a></h3>
<p>Shanghai Municipality began a comprehensive household registration check today. The check time is from 9:00 PM to 2:00 AM the next morning, and it is expected to be completed in districts within four hours. This comprehensive household registration check, also known as the population census, is an initiative of unprecedented scale in the modern history of household administration in our country. The Shanghai Municipal Government's handling of the population census is well-planned and fully prepared, which is worthy of praise from the citizens. Prior to the announcement of the census time, the municipal government announced a "Outline for the Implementation of Household Registration Check, Reissuance of National Identification Cards, and Distribution of Purchase Certificates," ordering all levels of supervisors and citizens to comply. Several days before the check day, each baojia distributed new national identification cards and index cards with purchase certificates based on the household registration survey register, and each household filled them out in advance to prepare for on-the-spot verification and issuance of new certificates and collection of old certificates at the time of the check. At the same time, personnel participating in the census were trained and given household administration knowledge. Mayor Wu and Speaker Pan, etc., based on academic theory and facts, gave speeches to the citizens on the significance of the population census, so that the citizens could better understand the significance of implementing the new policy. Today is the day of the city-wide comprehensive entry check. Traffic has been controlled, and the census personnel have also been mobilized. The population of each jia and each household is well-known. Starting at 9:00 PM, they will remain stationary and wait for the arrival of the census personnel. This is a very gratifying thing.</p>
<p>The administrative and theoretical significance of the population census has been demonstrated in advanced countries. Kunming and Chongqing during the War of Resistance Against Japan also had brilliant achievements. This newspaper's editorial on October 9th has elaborated in detail. What we want to point out today is that in Shanghai, which is currently turbulent and uneasy due to the impact of changes in the war situation and the economic crisis, the emotions of most citizens are uneasy and their lives are chaotic. Under this state of unease and chaos, the effect of implementing a new policy related to livelihood will naturally be different from that in normal times. Therefore, we hope that the authorities, the census personnel, and all citizens will deal with it calmly, carefully, and patiently, and enthusiastically support it, and pay attention to the following points:</p>
<p>First, the population census is a static statistic, which takes the actual population as the criterion. There is no doubt about this in academic theory and statistics. However, the important purpose of this Shanghai Municipal population census is to reissue new national identification cards at the same time as the census, and the legal basis for the national identification card is the new Household Registration Law. According to the household registration survey referred to in the Household Registration Law, it is a dynamic statistic, which takes the legal entry as the criterion. The comprehensive household registration check held today, in principle, focuses on the "actual population on the spot," that is, the actual population. If there is a household registration, identification card, and a reliable certificate from the baojia proving that they are going out or traveling, it is hoped that they can also reissue new certificates according to the Household Registration Law, so as to avoid conflicts between laws and regulations and make citizens feel disappointed. This is a kind of technical flexibility, and it is hoped that the authorities and the census personnel will pay attention to it.</p>
<p>Second, the national identification card is a notarization of the people's nationality and identity, to show personal rights and obligations, and thus receive legal protection and government protection. This system is well implemented in advanced countries and has deep educational and civil rights significance. It is hoped that the citizens of Shanghai will not misunderstand and cause disturbances. The "National Identification Card Statement" and the date of birth and nationality on the card are related to personal rights and obligations, so they must be filled in accurately and must be consistent with the birth and nationality declared in the past household registration. Military service refers to serving in the military and military officer (adjutant) service, and compulsory labor refers to performing corvée, which are related to personal obligations and behavior, so they must be filled in accurately and must be consistent with the military service certificate. Do not make false reports, which will hinder the promotion of military service. In short, the citizens' statements must be accurate and credible. If there are any items that they do not understand, they can ask the baojia or the census personnel for explanation, so as to comply with the principle of accuracy and credibility. Third, the implementation of the population census is to facilitate administration. The importance that the citizens of Shanghai attach to the exchange of identification cards is due to the dazzling 144 shopping coupons. Every citizen hopes that after receiving the new card, they can purchase daily necessities with the card. It is heard that after the price limit is cancelled, the distribution of goods has not been completely abolished, but it is difficult to determine when it will be implemented. Therefore, it is hoped that the government authorities will immediately consider implementing the distribution of goods after the exchange of identification cards, so as not to disappoint the citizens and affect the implementation of any new policies in the future. Otherwise, this exchange of identification cards and issuance of purchase certificates will become an administrative waste, and will only be criticized for disturbing the people. This should not be ignored.</p>
<p>Fourth, the purpose of conducting the population census should be simple and should not involve anything else, so as to avoid harassment and leave a better impression of the new policy on the people. In the past, it was rumored that the "underground warehouses" would be investigated on the day of the check, which caused panic among the citizens. Later, the Director of the Civil Affairs Bureau issued a statement denying it, and the citizens' confusion was dispelled. The population census is a statistical work, and the implementation of this statistical work and educational work should not only not investigate the people's property and materials, but also should not hinder the people's freedom, and use excuses to arrest them, etc. In this Shanghai population census, the citizens are enthusiastically supporting and joyfully supporting it, which is a rare thing in the turbulent situation. It is hoped that there will be a good start and a good ending, and that a good impression will be preserved for the citizens in difficulty.</p>
<p>In short, the population census is a very important measure. The government and the citizens need to be patient and careful to complete this work smoothly. Do not let any complications arise, and do not cause disturbances. This is what we call for again.</p>

<h3 id="e43">Molotov's Speech Has Moderate Wording: Sends Overtures to Truman; Criticizes Republican Party for Leading America to Adopt Adventurous Policies; Generally Believed that This Soviet Expression May Reopen the Door to Peace Talks <a href="#e43" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c43" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">43</a></h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Moscow, 6th] The celebration of the 31st anniversary of the Soviet October Revolution was held at the Bolshoi Theatre at 7 PM tonight. All senior Soviet government officials, such as Molotov, Malenkov, and Voroshilov, attended, but Stalin was absent.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Moscow, 6th, United Press] Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov hinted that the Republican Party should be held responsible for the US's adoption of an "aggressive policy." Some people believe that Molotov's move is intended to open the door for peaceful negotiations with Truman to end the Cold War. Molotov's speech stated that Truman's re-election was due to the American people's opposition to the Republican Party's open aggression plan. On the issue of Japan, the Soviet Foreign Minister stated that Japan's war industry must be "completely eliminated." He also said that the Soviet Union was very dissatisfied with the long delay in concluding peace treaties with Japan and Germany, and that the Soviet Union could not turn a blind eye to the situation in Germany. It is because the United States, Britain, and France are fostering Nazi leaders in Germany and restoring their former status. Foreign observers here believe that Molotov's speech was relatively moderate. The speech did not make any new attacks on Western countries, implying that the hostility between the East and West worlds may ease. Molotov revealed the following seven points to the audience: (1) Stalin's interview with reporters from Pravda has pointed out a way for peace-loving people to crush anti-Soviet conspiracies. (2) The so-called Western European Union, the proposed Atlantic Alliance, and the possible Mediterranean Alliance are all part of the aggressor's war plan. (3) The Berlin crisis has not been resolved because the United States and Britain believe that their domination of the world has become a reality. (4) Britain and the United States are restoring Nazi power in Germany and abandoning various wartime agreements. (5) The Soviet Union's efforts in the United Nations to destroy the atomic bomb were obstructed by Western allies. The Soviet Union's proposal for major countries to reduce their armies by one-third has been rejected by the United States, Britain, France, and China. (7) The Marshall Plan has established several markets for the United States, making Western countries economically enslaved by the United States. Molotov also accused the United States of establishing military bases around the world and asked why the United States' military budget was eleven times higher than before the war. On the domestic front, Molotov said that the Soviet Union's current industrial production is 17% higher than the pre-war standard in 1940, and that Soviet heavy industry is now able to produce all kinds of machinery currently needed. The success of agriculture is also very significant.</p>

<p>[United Press, Paris, 6th] According to authoritative sources on the 6th, the neutral countries on the Security Council believe that it is necessary for the heads of the four powers to meet in order to resolve the Berlin crisis. They believe that only if Truman, Attlee, Queuille, and Stalin personally meet can the deadlock be finally broken. This meeting may also deal with other serious issues, such as atomic energy and the future of Germany.</p>
<p>Efforts by the United Nations to find a compromise solution have been blocked by the Soviet Union's use of the veto power. It is generally believed that a second failure will determine the fate of this world organization. President Truman's public expression of willingness to find a new basis for future negotiations with the Soviet Union is expected to generate a unified effort to resolve the Berlin issue. Neutral countries have also determined their position, because they believe that neither the East nor the West intends to start a war, and that both sides are willing to compromise if they can do so without losing face.</p>

<p>[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 6th] French experts are now extremely busy preparing to print the original text of the Atlantic Treaty drafted by France. This draft will greatly contribute to the upcoming consultations on the Atlantic Treaty. According to reliable sources, the French draft is a compromise between the Brussels Treaty and the Rio de Janeiro Treaty. Informed sources emphasized that the final form of the Atlantic Treaty will depend on several points that have not yet been discussed. The obligations stipulated in the treaty will obviously be flexible depending on the number of signatory countries. The provisions of the Atlantic Treaty are only an expression of free participation, and not all countries bordering the Atlantic must be bound by it, nor are all non-Atlantic neighboring countries excluded. This plan is based on the decision of the signatory countries' meeting of the Brussels Treaty held in Paris last time. After this, the Standing Committee of the five Western European countries will review the French draft and the drafts of other signatory countries. After the Standing Committee reaches a conclusion, it will convene a formal meeting with the United States and Canada.</p>

[United Press, Paris, 6th] Lieutenant General Riley, Chief of Staff of the Palestine Truce Supervision Organization, met with representatives of Lebanon, Syria, Egypt, and Iraq for three hours today, informing them that the Arabs' military position in Palestine is hopeless, and that making peace would be better. The meeting was convened by Acting Mediator Bunche, and Deputy Mediator Vigier was also present. It is also heard that the King of Transjordan has suggested making peace with Israel separately, but Transjordanian officials here have denied this.</p>

<p>[United Press, Washington, 7th] President Truman and his family took a special plane, "Independence," to Key West, Florida, for vacation today.</p>
<p>[United Press, Key West, Florida, 7th] President Truman is scheduled to arrive here today with his family for vacation, and the city is preparing a warm welcome. This is the President's fifth visit to this city, but the nature is different from the previous four times.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 6th, United Press] President Truman has formulated a policy of tightening expenditures for the fiscal year of 1950. According to Budget Director Webb, this budget will reduce federal spending to the lowest possible level. The above statement was announced after Truman consulted with cabinet members. Secretary of Defense Forrestal stated at the meeting that he did not intend to continue serving in the government. It is generally estimated that the budget for 1950 will be approximately 45 billion yuan. Webb said: The President ordered him to follow a tight budget policy.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 6th] President Truman, on the day after his return to Washington, which was also before his two-week vacation, separately summoned a large number of cabinet members. Those who were summoned and requested to visit the President included Acting Secretary of State Lovett, Secretary of the Navy Sullivan, Budget Director Webb, Secretary of Defense Forrestal, Secretary of Commerce Sawyer, and Secretary of the Treasury Snyder. Lovett and Truman met for half an hour. This meeting was considered the most important, especially since Lovett was not on the official list of visits to the President, and he entered and exited the White House through the side door, avoiding reporters. The White House and the State Department refused to comment on the meeting, which was held amid speculation in diplomatic circles. This speculation refers to the fact that the Soviet Union, ignoring the consensus on diplomatic issues called for by Republican and Democratic leaders after the election, has concentrated its efforts to break through the US bipartisan foreign policy. Lovett has put aside many extremely important diplomatic issues during the President's two-week absence, waiting for the election to end before making decisions. Lovett accompanied Ambassador Douglas to the UK, who returned to the US today for instructions, for a second visit with Truman. At the same time, the State Department did not comment on the news from Nanjing that Marshall had guaranteed that he would change the State Department's cold attitude towards aid to China in the future. People close to Truman said: Truman very much hopes that Marshall will decide to continue to serve, and Truman believes that Marshall is a great Secretary of State.</p>

<h3 id="e55">Vyshinsky Speaks at the Political Committee: Refutes Dulles's Remarks; US Building Bases Widely as Attack Targets <a href="#e55" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c55" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">55</a></h3>
<p>[United Press, Paris, 6th] Soviet representative Vyshinsky launched another general attack on Western countries in the Political Committee today. The focus of Vyshinsky's speech was to refute the remarks made yesterday by US representative Dulles, who claimed that the United States had stopped disarming because the world was afraid of the Soviet Union. Who is threatening the United States?</p>
<p>How does the Soviet Union threaten the United States? In fact, it is the United States, not the Soviet Union, that threatens other countries. The United States has two military bases in 28 locations in the Atlantic region alone. If the United States does not dream of controlling the world, why build so many bases around the world? To say that the United States does not want to control the world is just to deceive children. Vyshinsky also pointed out that British representative McNeil showed "strategic concern" for Greece. The Political Committee is scheduled to continue discussing the issues of Greece and the Balkans on the following day.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 6th] The Political Committee passed a resolution authorizing the chairman of the committee to negotiate with the Greek authorities regarding the impending execution of ten Greek labor leaders by a Greek military tribunal for rebellion. The committee had previously rejected a Soviet amendment calling for taking all steps to save the lives of the Greek trade union leaders.</p>

<p>[United Press, Tokyo, 7th] The Tokyo Mainichi Shimbun published on the 7th an article by its foreign editor Takada, who interviewed the famous scientist Einstein in Princeton, New Jersey, stating that Einstein believed that war would not occur in the near future because "the Soviet Union fears war, and the American people also do not want war." Takada is currently visiting the United States. According to reports, Einstein said: "The American people hate the Soviet Union very much, but I do not believe that the United States will attack any country unless the United States is attacked by that country first." When asked if he believed that the Soviet Union already had atomic bombs, Einstein replied: "Who knows? They may have it, but if they have atomic bombs, I think they may not be as effective as American atomic bombs."</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] In order to regulate the supply of sugar, the Taiwan Sugar Corporation, which originally planned to sell sugar this Friday, has decided to start selling today, still using the quotation and approval method. The allocation quantity is still limited to 20 bags for direct users and 100 bags for sugar merchants. It is also reported that before being ordered to change the method, the company decided to allocate 10,000 tons per month as usual. The company currently has a sugar inventory of 38,000 tons in Shanghai. Furthermore, the Taiwan Xizhou Sugar Factory will start producing sugar within one or two weeks. It is expected that the new sugar will be available on the market and shipped to Shanghai in December of this year. Therefore, the company has full confidence in the sugar supply.</p>

It is said that it will depend on the materials we need for barter. The Allied Headquarters in principle hope to export processed products, while we hope to import raw materials, so further negotiations are needed between the two parties. If a deal can be reached, the 100,000 tons of sugar will be shipped in the first half of next year.</p>

<h3 id="e70">The Gold Control Bureau Announces the Financial Inspection Along the Beijing-Shanghai Railway Line; 59 Banks and Money Shops Penalized for Violations <a href="#e70" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c70" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">70</a></h3>
<p>According to the Shanghai Gold Control Bureau, the Shanghai Financial Administration Bureau previously sent a large number of auditors to inspect the businesses of banks, money shops, and other financial institutions in Suzhou, Wujin, Wuxi, Zhenjiang, and other places along the Beijing-Shanghai Railway Line. The inspection reports have now been compiled separately. After detailed review by the bureau, penalties were proposed based on the severity of the circumstances, and were approved by the supervisor on the 5th of this month. It is estimated that the bureau inspected a large number of banks and money shops this time, including provincial banks, county banks, commercial banks, money shops, credit cooperatives, and underground money shops, totaling five categories. The number of institutions inspected included 1 head office of the provincial bank and 4 branches, 4 county banks, 22 commercial banks, 25 money shops, 14 credit cooperatives, and 3 underground money shops, totaling 59. Except for the credit cooperatives and underground money shops, which will be announced separately, the inspection results and penalties for provincial banks, county banks, and commercial banks and money shops are listed below:</p>
<p>Illegal Circumstances of Commercial Banks and Money Shops</p>
<p>(1) The illegal circumstances of the various commercial banks and money shops can be divided into: (1) establishing hidden accounts and secret ledgers; (2) managers, assistant managers, and staff of various departments using their authority to embezzle bank funds to engage in commerce; (3) concealing income and evading the payment of deposit reserves; (4) establishing branch offices in other cities without approval and engaging in private remittances; (5) discounting without recording or improper procedures; (6) not signing contracts for intercity remittances; (7) not collecting term loans beyond the limit; (8) using bank funds to hoard goods; (9) arbitrarily offsetting customer's accumulated bills before collection; (10) granting excessive credit loans; (11) accepting black market interest on deposits and loans; (12) improper accounting practices.</p>
<p>Wuxi and Zhenjiang Have the Most Serious Circumstances</p>
<p>The above-mentioned illegal circumstances all violate or are in breach of the relevant provisions of the "Banking Law," the "Measures for Restricting Loan Interest Rates," and the "Measures for Strengthening Financial Business Control." The Gold Control Bureau therefore imposed penalties in accordance with the penalty methods stipulated in the various laws and regulations. Among them, the most serious violations were found in the Wuxi Yuanfeng Renji Money Shop, Fuyuan Money Shop, and Zhenjiang Dingchang Money Shop, all of which were ordered to stop new business, stop clearing, and were handed over to the court for investigation. Those with relatively minor circumstances should be warned and their business corrected. There are 2 banks and 5 money shops. There should be further investigation. There are 1 bank and 3 money shops. The person in charge should be replaced and fined. There are 2 banks and 2 money shops. There should be a warning and a fine. There are 1 bank and 4 money shops. The person in charge should be replaced and handed over to the court for investigation. There is 1 money shop. There should be a fine and the person in charge should be replaced and handed over to the court for investigation. There are 2 banks and 7 money shops.</p>
<p>Replacement of Persons in Charge of County Banks in Four Locations</p>
<p>(2) After inspection of the county banks in Suzhou, Wuxi, Changzhou, and Zhenjiang, it was found that they either set up secret accounts to collect secret interest, colluded with customers to evade deposit reserves, embezzled treasury funds for other operations, or concealed income and recorded inaccurate accounts. Moreover, the senior officials in charge of each bank used their official positions to embezzle bank funds and engage in commerce and private lending. The circumstances of the crimes are significant and are in violation of Articles 33 and 43 of the Banking Law and Article 6 of the Measures for Strengthening Financial Business Control. In accordance with Article 13 of the Measures for Strengthening Financial Business Control, the persons in charge of each bank should be replaced, and operations should be improved in accordance with Article 11 of the County Banking Law in order to rectify the situation. The illegal personnel have also been instructed by the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Finance to investigate. Furthermore, the Wujin County Bank was previously ordered by the Ministry of Finance to replace the person in charge. In reality, the bank only replaced non-essential positions in an attempt to evade responsibility, showing negligence of official orders. The Jiangsu Provincial Department of Finance has also been ordered to reorganize the board of directors to facilitate supervision.</p>
<p>Five Officials of the Agricultural Bank's Head Office and Branches Dismissed</p>
<p>(3) The Provincial Bank, namely the Jiangsu Provincial Farmers Bank, was inspected. It was found in the head office and the Suzhou, Wuxi, Changzhou, and Zhenjiang branches that (1) the person in charge or internal staff embezzled bank funds for illegal operations; (2) the loans were excessive and exceeded the business scope of the Provincial Bank; (3) the discount did not have legal transaction certificates and was not handled in accordance with the discount acceptance method; (4) when collecting money from customers, the customer's address was not investigated in advance, and the loans were all credit loans with incomplete procedures; (5) overdrafts, without signing contracts or complying with the overdraft limit, often exceeded the limit; (6) improper accounting practices. In addition to instructing the Jiangsu Provincial Government to dismiss Liu Xunwu, the head of the cashier section of the bank's head office, and Zhao Jieshan, Qiu Youxin, and Cheng Runzhen, the auditors, and to investigate Guo Shoudao, the deputy manager of the Wuxi branch, the Gold Control Bureau also ordered a thorough correction of the remaining irregularities in business and accounting.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] In the final of the third Shanghai Table Tennis League Championship last night, Jingwu Red defeated Huamei 5-4 and won the championship. The process was tense and exciting. More than 2,000 spectators in the gymnasium created an unprecedentedly enthusiastic atmosphere. After the competition, Ms. Wang Yi presented the awards, and this year's Table Tennis League came to a close. The results of the two teams last night are listed below:</p>
<p>[Jingwu Red] [Huamei] Score</p>
<p>(1) Wang Youxin - Chuan Qifang 21-18</p>
<p>(2) Zhang Fuwei - Li Zongpei 12-21</p>
<p>(3) Ouyang Wei - Xue Xuchu 21-18</p>

<p>(8) Zhang Fuzhang - Fu Qifang 25-23</p>
<p>(9) Ouyang Wei - Li Zongpei 21-23</p>
<p>Table Tennis Committee Chairman Wang Yi delivered a speech, and General Secretary Chen Linsheng reported. Then, photos were taken and the competition began. All-China champion Wang Youxin flew from Taiwan to cheer for Jingwu, and won all three games last night. However, Xue Xuchu's defeat to Ouyang Wei in the third game and Fu Qifang's defeat to Zhang Fuwei in the eighth game were fatal blows to Huamei last night. Otherwise, the score would have been tied at 4 each, and the ninth game would have been the decider, making it impossible to say who would have won the championship.</p>

<h3 id="e75">Disposition Circumstances Ruling Execution <a href="#e75" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c75" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">75</a></h3>
<p>The disposition circumstances of the above three numbers have been executed separately by the Gold Control Bureau in accordance with the supervisory responsibility ruling. Among them, the disposition circumstances of commercial firms and villages have been ordered by the Gold Control Bureau to be followed and complied with. The remaining parts of the Soviet Jiangsu Farmers Bank and County Bank were sent by the bureau to the Jiangsu Provincial Government and the Department of Finance for review and execution. The entire process of discussing the illegal firms and villages was also reported to the Ministry of Finance for filing by the bureau. Regarding firms and villages in other regions and other financial institutions, because they have never been strictly inspected in the past, they have developed a bad style. The Gold Control Bureau, in the face of this real situation, has handled the disposition with leniency this time. For the four places of Suzhou, Wuxi, Changzhou and Zhenjiang, and other places where the firms and villages have not been inspected, they should be made to be vigilant and check themselves. The bureau is still prepared to send personnel to inspect the business of the villages around Shanghai at any time, hoping to bring them into line.</p>

<p>According to Tian Yongqian, Director of the Finance Bureau, the municipal government has not yet received a formal order from the central government regarding the 1.5-fold increase in salaries for public education personnel. At present, in order to take into account the difficult living conditions of municipal government employees, efforts are being made to raise funds to lend living expenses first. The amount will depend on the fund-raising situation. Since the salary adjustment of public education personnel, the municipal finance has been unable to balance income and expenditure. In addition to making every effort to rectify the source of taxation, each taxation office has been ordered to actively collect business tax.</p>
<h3 id="e77">New Prices Approved for Eight Public Utilities; Not Calculated Based on New Coal Prices <a href="#e77" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c77" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">77</a></h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The new prices for the eight public utility categories of water, electricity, gas, telephone, public buses, trams, ferries, and small railways in this city were meticulously calculated by the Municipal Public Utilities Bureau after inviting representatives from each company to discuss the actual costs of each company. They were presented to the mayor, who sent people to Beijing, and have now been approved by the central competent authorities for implementation.

<h3 id="e78">The Second Home for Female Workers; YMCA Female Workers' Night School; Free Supply of Spiritual and Material Food; Teachers and Students Have Harmonious Feelings and are as Close as Family <a href="#e78" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c78" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">78</a></h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Special] The flowers in the warm room, the darlings in the palace, when they are in the magnificent and Westernized school gate, they would never dream of a group of laborers being excluded from the school gate. In order to study, they are willing to cheer up after 12 hours of tiring work and go to the labor night school to attend classes.</p>
<p>The Chinese Christian Young Women's Association established six night schools for female workers in this city to meet the intellectual worries of laborers. Three are located in Huxi, located around Caojiadu and Xiaoshadu Road, and three are located in Huxi, located around Yangshupu, all of which are densely populated factory areas, providing female workers with spiritual food for free, and have long become the second home for female workers!</p>
<p>The female workers' night school has been established for more than 20 years. It is designed specifically for female workers, and everything is for female workers. The class time is from 7:00 pm to 9:00 pm every night, which does not conflict with their work, and the time can be flexible. If any of the students are assigned to work the night shift, the teacher will make up the class for them the next morning, so that their grades will not fall behind. And those female workers are all diligent and good students. After working hard all night, they do not eat or sleep, and are willing to drag their tired bodies and gather their spirits to go to their own school to attend classes the next morning. The female workers who study in the night school are models of students. They are never late, never leave early, never miss class easily, and are disciplined and polite.</p>
<p>Teaching Materials are Practical and Useful</p>
<p>The female workers' night school provides adult education, which can also be said to be literacy education. It is practical and useful. Under the premise of "learning for application," the teaching materials are compiled by the National Association of the Young Women's Association. The female workers' night school is divided into three classes: elementary, intermediate, and advanced. Each level studies for two terms and graduates in three years. Teaching is mainly in Mandarin. The most troublesome tortoise-rabbit race word problems in elementary school teaching materials have long been eliminated, and replaced by elementary abacus calculation, which is undoubtedly much more practical for female workers. Female workers who graduate from night school often have a Chinese language level that exceeds that of elementary school graduates. They can continue to subscribe, read simple books, and write ordinary letters.</p>
<p>Expenses are Donated</p>
<p>In addition, the most prominent feature of the labor night school is the harmonious relationship between teachers and students. It is not only a school, but also a family. Teachers are like parents, teaching students to read and solving their personal problems for them. Occasionally, if a student is absent from class, the teacher will definitely visit them to see if they are sick or if an accident has happened. It is truly a case of teachers and students becoming one, and students love this night school as much as everyone loves their own home. The expenses of the female workers' night school are taken from the Young Women's Association, and the Young Women's Association's expenses are donated by the society. Therefore, the female workers' department is always the first to respond enthusiastically when the Young Women's Association holds a fundraising conference every year. Moreover, at the end of the fundraising, the group awards of all previous sessions belong to the female workers' department. During the fundraising period, they are so excited that they cannot sleep and run around all day. The precious achievements are accumulated from pennies and nickels of hard-earned money.</p>
<p>Looking Forward to Social Assistance</p>
<p>Currently, there are more than 900 female workers studying at the female workers' night school, which has already reached the saturation point that the six schools can accommodate. However, at the beginning of each semester, there are always a large number of new students requesting admission. This shows that life has deprived them of their right to study, and work has taken up their time to study. Although only two hours are left, their desire to learn to read is still very high. However, the Young Women's Association, due to the limitation of enrollment, finally has to heartbrokenly watch them leave in disappointment.</p>
<p>The Young Women's Association has been hoping to expand the female workers' night school for several years, but it has not been able to fulfill its wish due to limited funding. This time, the 40th fundraising conference of the Young Women's Association has already opened. They hope that this year's fundraising can have unexpected gains, so that the Labor Department plans to open another female workers' night school to benefit the female workers. This is practical work to eliminate illiteracy and is the most meaningful charity. May people of insight help!</p>
<p>The Dyeing and Weaving Industry Continues to Handle Distribution; Special Allocation to Stores, Quoted and Approved Allocation</p>
<p>The cotton cloth produced by the machine dyeing and weaving industry in this city, during the price-limited period, in addition to being sold by each factory on its own and reporting to the association for record, the cloth woven from the allocated cotton yarn will be submitted to the association for joint distribution in order to show fairness. A total of four phases of allocation have been received and distributed to the members of the cotton cloth, sewing, hardware decoration, and embroidery industries. Later, the price limit was canceled, the yarn allocation was stopped, and it came to a temporary end. This method has been praised by the authorities, who believe that in the current situation where the source of goods for retailers is not smooth, it is necessary for other industries to start implementing it, and they have been instructed separately to expedite matters. After receiving this instruction from the authorities, the Dyeing and Weaving Association convened the distribution committee yesterday. After detailed discussions, it was decided to continue the joint distribution, and it was agreed that retailers should be given priority in the allocation in order to supply the market and restore the city's appearance. As for the distribution method, it is intended to refer to the quotation and approval method set by the Textile Building Company in order to help suppress cloth prices. It is reported that the industry association has submitted a request to the Social Affairs Bureau for filing and is actively preparing for implementation.</p>

<h3 id="e83">General Commodity Prices: Market Activity Extremely Low, Commodity Prices Rise in a Straight Line <a href="#e83" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c83" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">83</a></h3>
<p>Since the promulgation and implementation of the Emergency Measures for Financial and Economic Affairs, which included price controls for over two months, ultimately, due to improper implementation and lack of coordination, a buying spree has been created, pervading the entire country, with goods hidden and nine out of ten stores empty. Under this severe atmosphere, the authorities had no choice but to stipulate supplementary measures. The main points of the supplementary measures are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Grain is to be traded easily at market prices, with free transportation and sales. (2) Cotton cloth, sugar, coal, and salt will have their prices set by the central authorities, based on cost, for overall regulation. Other important goods, including daily necessities and industrial raw materials, will be managed by local governments, authorized to refer to supply conditions and follow the principle of cost-based pricing. (3) Public utilities and transportation enterprises should calculate costs, and the competent authorities should approve and adjust prices. (4) Salaries of civil and military officials and teachers should be adjusted appropriately, considering the necessities of life. (5) Wages should be adjusted appropriately, considering the needs to maintain workers' livelihoods. (6) Regarding commodity taxes and other ad valorem taxes, collection should be adjusted based on commodity prices, in accordance with tax laws. From the promulgation of the new economic plan to the announcement of the supplementary measures on November 1st, it took exactly seventy days. We believe that: (1) The price control policy has, in fact, been completely abandoned. (2) The effectiveness of currency reform has also been mostly destroyed. (3) In economic terms, it is a 180-degree turn, with everything almost reverting to the original state of the legal tender era. (4) Merchants who sold goods according to price controls, as well as law-abiding citizens who exchanged gold certificates, have suddenly suffered a great loss. (5) The future economic situation will become even more difficult, and we do not know how the authorities will manage the aftermath or how they will appease the majority of good people who have suffered losses.</p>
<p>Last week, transportation businesses nationwide, under the restraints of price controls for the past two months, adjusted their new prices one after another. (1) Starting from the 5th, passenger and freight rates on ships increased uniformly by four times, while those calculated in Taiwan currency increased by 120 percent. (2) Starting from the 7th, railway passenger fares increased fivefold, and freight rates increased by onefold. (3) The price of domestic regular letters is proposed to increase to ten cents per piece, and telegrams to four cents per word, to be implemented after completing the legislative process. (4) Public utility prices in this city are about to be adjusted, including water, electricity, gas, telephone, and other items, with some saying that an additional charge will be added starting from the 1st. Last week, the trend of market commodity prices, due to the lifting of price controls, was as if they had been liberated. At the beginning of the week, due to being caught off guard and negotiating pricing, very little business was conducted. Later on, chaotic bidding occurred, with prices rising madly in a straight line. First, let's talk about cotton cloth. Because supplementary measures stipulated that the central government must set the price based on cost, there was only off-market bidding in this city before the central government's approval. Long-absent 40-count Blue Phoenix brand cotton yarn was first bid at 3,900 yuan on Tuesday. After that, it soared all the way, once breaking the 10,000 yuan mark on Friday, settling at 9,500 yuan. By the weekend, it created a high price of 12,000 yuan. 21-count Double Horse yarn rose from 2,200 yuan on Tuesday to close at 7,300 yuan at the weekend. Dragon Head shirting was bid at 90 yuan on Tuesday, rising continuously. In one day on Friday, it jumped from 180 yuan to 250 yuan, and at the weekend it continued to climb to a peak of 310 yuan.</p>
<p>At the opening of the grain market on Monday, the negotiated price for top-quality white rice was 80 yuan, but because production costs had risen sharply, the negotiated price could not take effect. By the weekend, the market was tending to stall again, with black market prices soaring.</p>
<p>The rise in coarse grains was rampant. Edible oil and flour were not transacted, but off-market bidding rose relentlessly. On Friday, soybean oil was bid at 550 yuan, and vegetable oil at 500 yuan. In the flour market on Wednesday, miscellaneous brand flour was bid at 31 yuan, and on the weekend, "Warship" brand flour was bid at 73 yuan. Daily necessities such as cigarettes, soap, and matches were all rising continuously at high peaks, with no signs of stopping. In short, the surge in market commodity prices last week was so fierce that even the legal tender era could not match it. After some commodities were opened for negotiated pricing, they were immediately renegotiated, as if in a major reaction to the high pressure of price controls for the past two months. Regarding the amount of Gold Yuan Notes issued, according to the third inspection announcement by the Gold Yuan Note Issuance Reserve Supervisory Committee, as of October 31st, a total of 1,595,386,691.00 yuan of Gold Yuan Notes had been issued. This was an increase of 638,634,196.60 yuan from the issuance amount of 956,752,494.40 yuan at the end of September, an increase of approximately 67 percent. With such a sharp increase in the issuance of Gold Yuan Notes and commodity prices soaring relentlessly, it is becoming increasingly difficult to balance government revenue and expenditure, and we are indeed being forced back onto the old path of vicious inflation.</p>
<h3 id="e84">Currency and Finance: Northern Capital Flows South, Money Market Gradually Strengthens, Public Sentiment Revived, Interest Rates Rise Quietly <a href="#e84" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c84" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">84</a></h3>
<p>Last week, the money market in this city still exhibited a very tight situation in the first half of the week. Starting on Monday, the authorities decided to abolish price controls and instead use negotiated pricing. This was tantamount to giving a stimulant to the long-fatigued public sentiment. Everyone in the market felt that commodity prices could rise sharply from now on. As a result, deposits in banks were withdrawn entirely, causing an unprecedented shortage of orders in the industry. In desperation, banks had no choice but to cope with this panic by borrowing money from outside the industry or using cash for compensation. However, the people outside the industry also showed no weakness. Despite the tight money market and commodity prices jumping several times, the trend of rushing to buy goods in the market was still extremely popular. This benefited the owners of capital, and interest rates rose to one high point after another. On Thursday, the money market interest rate reached as high as ninety cents, and ordinary interest rates were also bid at over sixty cents, which was truly an irresistible blow to the banking industry. Although bank interest rates, from Tuesday onwards, had been adjusted several times at the request of the industry, to six percent for deposit interest and one cent for loan interest, and one cent and five points for interbank lending, they were still far behind the high interest rates. With banks reporting shortages of funds one after another, they had become mere transfer agencies for customers. Last week, there were rumors that some banks were unstable. Although it was later proven that nothing went wrong, the precarious situation of the banking industry can be imagined. By the second half of the week, the situation in the financial world was completely different. This was to be expected. With the Northeast fallen and North China already suffering an unprecedentedly severe threat, capital, known for its sensitivity, flowed south in torrents, seeking its refuge. This temporarily eased the tight money situation in this city. The shortage of orders in the industry generally improved, and the amount of bounced checks decreased from Thursday onwards, and cash reserves were no longer as tight as in the past. Last week, interest rates repeatedly reached high peaks. On Monday, ordinary interest was charged at four cents, and by Wednesday, interbank interest rates of five cents and four points were commonly seen, with the highest even reaching beyond six cents. The money market interest rate was forty-eight cents on Tuesday, but on Thursday it rose to ninety cents. Although Northern funds arrived on Friday, the money market interest rate still stood at seventy-five cents, and other interest rates were also around sixty cents.</p>
<p>The exchange situation of national banks and bureaus had a surplus in the first half of the week due to tax revenues and other income, which naturally exacerbated the tight money situation. In the second half of the week, the banks and bureaus went from surplus to deficit, with even a deficit of several million yuan on Thursday. It is said that the authorities are considering resuming the publication of the exchange deficit of national banks and bureaus. It is remembered that during the price control period, the authorities prohibited national banks and bureaus from publishing the exchange deficit, presumably to avoid stimulating the bullish sentiment with the large deficit figures. Now, if they resume publishing the deficit figures, it may be to give a counter-stimulus to the bullish sentiment with the large surplus figures from the sale of goods. If so, then in the near future, national banks and bureaus may have continuous large surpluses.</p>
<p>Last week, the interbank exchange rate remained at the maximum price control rate of 24/1000. In addition to the fact that the actual exchange rate differed greatly from the price control rate, the interbank exchange rate of national banks and bureaus was also brewing for adjustment last week.</p>
<p>Regarding foreign exchange rates, the authorities have repeatedly denied any talk of liberalization. It is said that export businesses are being supported by export loans. As for how to increase remittances from overseas Chinese, there are no specific measures to be found. The Hong Kong foreign exchange market showed little fluctuation. Gold was at HK$305.5 per tael on Monday, HK$306 on Tuesday, and then rose by another half yuan on Thursday. The market price of US dollars was 5.26 yuan on Monday, once fell to 5.24 yuan on Tuesday, and then rebounded to 5.26 yuan on Thursday.</p>
<h3 id="e85">Xiong Shihui in Nanchang: Talks About the War Situation and Jiangxi's Condition, Predicts That by the End of the Year or Next Spring, the World Will Have a Startling Event <a href="#e85" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c85" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">85</a></h3>
<p>— Our Reporter Liu Zao</p>
<p>[Our Nanchang Telegram, 5th] Mr. Xiong Shihui recently returned to Jiangxi from Nanjing. When passing through Jiujiang, he stayed briefly at Guling. After arriving in Nanchang, he attended the tea party of the Provincial Assembly and the expanded commemorative week of various circles in the provincial capital. He also attended a reception held by the Provincial Party Headquarters of the Kuomintang, which was in the midst of a dispute over the re-election of the chairman. At each gathering, Xiong emphasized that the current situation of the National Army is not as pessimistic as the general pessimists believe. He also believes that by the end of this year, or at the latest next spring, even more startling events will occur in the world. At that time, China's situation will naturally change from independently supporting itself and fighting against the communist army to becoming a main force in the world's upholding of justice and war.</p>
<p>A Military Man's View</p>
<p>He said: Recently, the National Army's abandonment of Changchun, the loss of Jinan, and the successive retreats of Zhengzhou and Kaifeng have made everyone believe that the Communist bandits are gradually approaching success and that the military discipline of the National Army is greatly deteriorated and morale is low. In fact, this is not the case. In the current military situation, Changchun and Jinan have long become isolated islands. As long as the bandit army is willing to fight to the death at the cost of sacrifice, we can abandon them after obtaining a considerable price.</p>
<p>The retreats of Kaifeng and Zhengzhou, from a military man's point of view, are not at all surprising in military significance. Because in the past, our failures were due to military affairs being constrained by politics. For example, the last time Kaifeng fell, the National Representatives, Supervisory Committee members, and local figures in Henan all petitioned the central government for reinforcements. As a result, the National Army, in order to take care of political public opinion, caused the strategic situation to become passive, stationing troops everywhere, being weak everywhere, and being beaten everywhere, just like Jesus being nailed to the cross, unable to move his hands and feet.</p>
<p>Actively Seizing Opportunities</p>
<p>Now, our strategy has changed. Although we have withdrawn from Kaifeng and other places, we can mobilize troops flexibly, increase our combat power, and adapt to our strategic needs. We can actively seize opportunities to annihilate the bandit army. Xiong also made a summary comparison of the strength of the National Army and the Communist army to illustrate the future of the war and the final victory. He said: Looking at the entire military strength of the bandit and our land, sea, and air forces, there is no doubt that the National Army has an absolute advantage. Specifically, in terms of the army alone, the bandit and our military strength in the Northeast is comparable, the National Army has an advantage in North China, and it goes without saying in Central and South China. In the past, the National Army was deploying troops everywhere and being passive everywhere. Now, this rigid strategy has been completely corrected. Xiong further cited the President's public announcement in the central government to predict the future of the war, believing that the communist bloc cannot lead the world, and the Chinese Communist Party is a tail of the communist bloc, and of course, it is even more impossible to succeed in China.</p>
<p>Establishing a Pacification and Construction Base</p>
<p>Speaking of the situation in Jiangxi, Xiong emphasized the personality, experience, and knowledge of Chairman Hu Jiafeng, believing that Jiangxi can be made a base for suppressing the rebellion and a vanguard for national construction. However, he believes that the prevailing clan fights and factional struggles in various counties of Jiangxi are hindering Jiangxi's progress and harming the people.</p>
<p>He said: Now, the general public in Jiangxi, when thinking of the communist army's claim to cross the river, is holding unnecessary excessive panic. This is a wrong mentality. From the perspective of military deployment, he further explained that the current defense of Jiangxi is prepared for any eventuality. Because there is the Quzhou Pacification Headquarters in the east, the Changsha Pacification Headquarters in the west, the Central China剿總 in the north, and the Guangzhou Pacification Headquarters in the south. The provincial territory is surrounded by careful military deployments. As long as we work hard to organize and train the masses, strengthen the day-to-day defense forces, and refine the teams, so that the invisible bandits cannot hide and the tangible bandits cannot enter, we have fulfilled our security responsibilities and should also fulfill our national obligation to suppress the rebellion. For example, if the country needs soldiers, we will send troops if we have them. If the country needs grain, we should send grain if we have it. We hope that the bandit disaster will not repeat itself in Jiangxi, so we should send troops, send grain, and fulfill the local responsibility to suppress the rebellion. We should also put out the clan fights and factional struggles in various counties, everything for the people, everything for pacification and construction. In the future, Jiangxi can become a base for suppressing the rebellion and a vanguard for national construction.</p>
<h3 id="e86">The Case of the Woman from Huangdu Township Being Raped to Death: The Question of the Culprit Has Not Yet Been Clarified <a href="#e86" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c86" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">86</a></h3>
<p>[Our Qingpu Telegram, 6th] The case of Shen Pang Guiying, a woman from Huangdu Township, being illegally detained by the former Qinglong District Office and raped to death on July 17, has been more than three months. The County Judicial Office has conducted four investigative hearings, but the identity of the culprit has not yet been clarified. It is now heard that the defendant, District Chief Xu Jiwu, etc., believe that the cause of death of "suicide by hanging out of shame after being raped" as identified by Su High Court forensic doctor Xuan Fang in the previous exhumation and examination of Shen's remains is unscientific and difficult to accept. If the Judicial Office determines that they are guilty of rape, they will jointly file a complaint with the High Court against Xuan Fang and request that another forensic doctor be sent to examine the body again. The current Judicial Office has been ordered to be upgraded to a District Court, and the new President Wang Shichun has arrived in Qingpu. After its establishment next month, it will be tried by the District Procuratorate.</p>

<h3 id="e87">Starting from "Boiled Ice Cream" <a href="#e87" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c87" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">87</a></h3>
<p>— Suo Jian</p>
<p>This summer, many people cannot afford ice cream, so they buy ice cream powder. But after buying the powder, they cannot make ice cream, so they have to mix it with boiling water and taste the hot "boiled ice cream." Yet no one complains that this "boiled ice cream" is not cold, and everyone praises it, saying that "the taste is delicious and the quality is good." Now, many people cannot afford milk, so they comfort themselves by saying, "Ice cream powder can replace milk, it tastes better than milk, and it doesn't cost sugar." Many mothers of infants, because fish and meat are expensive and milk is becoming increasingly scarce, are also vying to use ice cream powder as a substitute for milk powder to feed their babies. Without discussing the composition of ice cream powder, it is certainly insufficient to replace milk powder, but it can at least barely satisfy the infants' hunger, because ice cream powder was initially quite cheap, and the parents in the salaried class could barely afford it.</p>
<p>However, the government never makes overall arrangements to distribute these long-accumulated, cheaply "conceded" materials from friendly countries to benefit the salaried class, but instead allows them to flow continuously into the hands of the "cattle party," with most of them scattered on both sides of the road, raising prices every day and making high profits. It was not until the buying spree broke out and the "salaried class" was on the verge of death that the government remembered the few remaining leftover materials, saying that it would implement rationing. Although there is not much left, and half of it is moldy, it can at least save the urgent needs of some teachers and civil servants. As a result, many people took their ration purchase certificates and were overjoyed. No one investigated the government's past "crimes" of continuously allowing smuggling, waste, and mold. The leniency and forgiveness of teachers, civil servants, and the general salaried class in our country towards the authorities is truly unparalleled!</p>
<p>Who knew that after the price controls were lifted, commodity prices jumped seven or eight levels in a row, and many prices were successively "ordered" to be adjusted, while the treatment of teachers and civil servants was still under discussion for improvement, with permission to increase by one and a half times. By the time they receive the new treatment, it will be late November or early December. Just at this moment, the Materials Supply Bureau announced a few days ago that it would close its doors and raise prices, depriving the teachers and civil servants of their only meager "cheapness"! In all countries of the world, ancient and modern, Chinese and foreign, the harsh treatment and abuse of teachers, civil servants, and the salaried class is probably unparalleled! In the world, the injustice of things and the unreasonableness of reason probably reach their peak with this measure of the Materials Supply Bureau!</p>
<p>Government! I want to ask you: Leftover materials can be allowed to rot, and can also be allowed to benefit the scalpers, is it really impossible to sell them cheaply to the teachers and civil servants who are on the verge of death and whose families are hungry?</p>
<h3 id="e88">Hypnotic Anesthesia <a href="#e88" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c88" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">88</a></h3>
<p>— Mao Yi</p>
<p>Due to the lack of anesthetics, it forced doctors San Biman and Wu Qulefu of a prisoner of war hospital near Singapore to try to replace anesthetics with hypnotism. They decided to first select dental and surgical conditions to try hypnotism.</p>
<p>When performing hypnotism, the patient is asked to lie supine on the chair. The method adopted is a "concentration fatigue method", asking the patient to stare fixedly at the tip of a pencil, the distance between the pencil and the eye is extremely close, so close that if it goes a little further, it will appear blurry. This method was first created by Dr. James Braid around 1840, and he called this method hypnotism. His main purpose was to put the patient into a "state of suggestion" in order to treat various diseases.</p>
<p>Among the patients of San Biman and Wu Qulefu, twenty-three people had their teeth extracted. Other cases included nail removal and incision and drainage of suppurating wounds.</p>
<p>It is important for the hypnotist to verbally assure the patient during hypnosis that they will not feel pain during and after the surgery, and that they will not remember the surgery afterwards. If the patient feels pain after the surgery, it is either because the hypnotist neglected appropriate suggestions, or because the patient was awakened too quickly after the first suggestion was made (i.e. less than ten minutes).</p>
<p>In the mid-seventeenth century, someone tied the feet of a chicken, placed it on the ground, and after it stopped struggling, drew a straight line in front of it with chalk, which could hypnotize it and keep it still. However, the general public still does not trust this operation very much. One scholar was even forced to resign from his position as a medical lecturer at the University of London in 1838 due to practical hypnotism.</p>
<p>The success of the two doctors Shan and Wu overturned past prejudices. Now is the time to thoroughly review the relationship between hypnotism and suggestion to surgical medical skills.</p>
<h3 id="e89">Remembering Mr. Liang Juchuan <a href="#e89" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c89" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">89</a></h3>
<p>— Qinghua</p>
<p>In the midst of a scene of panic buying, queuing, and confusion, I don't know why, it reminded me of this old gentleman who has been dead for more than thirty years. He was Liang Ji (Juchuan) of Guilin, Liang Shuming's father, who drowned himself in Jishuitan, Beijing, in the morning of the seventh day of the tenth lunar month in 1918 (the seventh year of the Republic of China).</p>
<p>His death is vaguely said by general compilers of modern history to be martyrdom to the Qing Dynasty, which seems somewhat out of context, without the patience to study his lengthy multiple letters of more than sixty pages. His death once again became a major debate between the shocks of the new and old literary circles. Speaking calmly from our current perspective, his death seems to be the most loyal and even the most extreme expression of loyalty to democracy in the Republic of China. For example, he saw the rise of the Republic of China, the collapse of old morality, and the new morality Zhu invented. "High-ranking officials and contemporary talents advocated gambling, prostitution, and all kinds of ridiculous pleasures, which became popular for a while and spread to each other." "Reforming bureaucrats missed the best opportunity. ... Each department was reorganized, not first taking character and integrity as the standard, but still being warm and affectionate, only calculating to place private individuals." The earliest original order of not calculating the position and generally paying a living allowance of sixty yuan was later repeatedly improved, forming a source of profit. This place made him hate Yuan Shikai and Zhao Bingjun, the premier of the cabinet, the general of Yuan's staff, known as "Zhian." (Zhao was also a key figure in the assassination of Song Jiaoren, and it was later rumored that Xiangcheng poisoned him.) Mr. Liang was a good civil servant who valued tranquility and obeyed the law. He also served as an official of the Republic of China, but he still adhered to the old rules of the Xianfeng and Tongzhi periods of the late Qing Dynasty. Except for not seeing superiors privately in the office, he never solicited Zhao, and he still published an old letter to Zhao Bingjun, hoping that he would realize his mistake, before his death. Although it was somewhat close to "seeking skin from a tiger," the cover of the will stated that people should call the authorities to let them know: "Yun Juchuan left a public letter and died."</p>
<p>When he decided to die as a martyr, "knowing that the general trend is difficult to save, and donating this small amount to preserve a line of national character," he was still very yearning for the parliament of the early Republic of China, and asked his children several times when the parliament would open. "Unexpectedly, after the parliament opened in the year of the癸丑(1913), the general parliamentarians were all not the parliamentarians that they had hoped for in their hearts, and they were not at all concerned with saving the people and the country, making trouble and doing things for themselves, and not succeeding in anything." This cut off his idea of ​​going to the parliament in person to "earnestly state the people's livelihood and national plan." His suicide was precisely to shock and revitalize, and never to seek fame and praise for himself. He once said with emotion: I am so old, even if I live for another twenty years, I will only listen to operas and eat at restaurants every day. Although I do not compete with the world, what good is it for the country? It turns out that this old gentleman was still one of the people who promoted new dramas in the late Qing Dynasty, and had compiled the script for the drama "Women Love the Country", which was performed in the capital in the year of Bingwu (1906) of Guangxu. It was based on the story of the daughter of Lu Qishi worrying about Lu. He usually believed that "gathering thousands of people to give orders in person is no more than a drama theater," so he paid great attention to its profound educational nature.</p>
<p>This old gentleman was a decisive, intelligent, meticulous, thoughtful, and observant person. The entire will, with closely spaced words and detailed notes, hooks, strokes, circles, and dots, can truly be said to be full of repeated reminders, lingering and sad. What is especially admirable is that he wrote these texts for a period of about five or six years. Whenever he had free time, he would close the door and write quickly. If something suddenly interrupted him (once it was a meeting of the electric light company), he would also explain it on the paper and continue writing when he had time. He often locked it in a drawer and kept it secret, not letting anyone know. According to his own record, "癸丑甲寅 second daughter Shi Lu prevented the investigation," and after several years, he was still able to fulfill his long-cherished wish, and he truly died peacefully!</p>
<p>His will has a photo-written version. In 1940, when I first met Liang Shuming in Hong Kong, I asked if this book could be reprinted, and Shuming looked sad. I dare to say that this book is very rare outside. The ancients said that when you hear the drums, you think of generals. We, however, suddenly mention Mr. Juchuan during this bitter period of restlessness, naturally cherishing his uncompromising attitude towards life. Xian Si</p>
<h3 id="e90">Odds and Ends <a href="#e90" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c90" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">90</a></h3>
<p>— Xian Si</p>
<p>The general commodity prices in the United States now average 69% higher than before the war (1939); prices in Iceland are 207% higher than before the war; Mexico is 205% higher; Czechoslovakia is 178% higher; and Newfoundland is 72% higher.</p>
<p>Among the surplus materials of the US Navy, there is a type of seawater (seawater) soap, which no one asked about and was left for a long time. Later, it was all bought by a company in Gaza, and it is said that it is very useful for washing camels with many fleas using Da Zhong soap.</p>
<h3 id="e91">Grasping Life <a href="#e91" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c91" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">91</a></h3>
<p>— Song Xian</p>
<p>Professor Osigin of Columbia University once published an article describing how a disabled student, Regina Pike, faced death and completed his studies.</p>
<p>Pike was unfortunately born with progressive paralysis. The symptoms of paralysis were gradually progressing in his body. He sat in a wheelchair because his legs could no longer move.</p>
<p>Doctors told Pike that his only hands could remain healthy for two years, and when the symptoms of paralysis progressed to the heart, there would be no cure. Pike remained energetic and maintained an optimistic attitude. He decided to make good use of these short two years of life; friends raised money for him to attend school.</p>
<p>Within two years, his grades were outstanding and he was praised as the best student in the entire school, but he never mentioned that he had an incurable disease.</p>
<p>Professor Osigin once asked him: "Why are you only preparing for two years? What do you plan to do after two years?"</p>
<p>He smiled and said, "I will be dead after two years."</p>
<p>Pike's spirit is admirable. After his death, his face still shone with the glory of victory. He had used his only two years of life to meet the approaching grim reaper with calm courage day by day.</p>
