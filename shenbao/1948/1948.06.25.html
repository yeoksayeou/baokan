<p>〔本報蘭州廿四日電〕據悉：總統在西安召開西北高級將領軍事會議，此間行轅主任張治中，副主任兼靑海主席馬步芳，及八十一師指揮官馬鴻賓等，均於四日晨八時專機飛陜。</p>
<p>〔本報西安廿四日電〕張治中偕馬鴻賓等，今午自蘭州飛抵西安。又，郭懺·侯騰·鄧文儀等一行，亦於午間乘專機由京飛抵西安。</p>
<p>〔本報南京廿四日電〕豫東黃泛區一帶正醞釀大戰，陳毅匪部大部由魯西越隴海路南竄內黃·闌封以南，及杞縣·扶溝中間地區，犯開封之陳匪一部亦南竄尉氏附近，在中牟向沙間者則竄至新鄭密縣一帶，幾已悉教　集於豫東大平原，國軍則分由民權·確山·駐馬店·鄭州及魯西等地向匪壓迫，並以有力部隊向杞縣進擊，俾在此廣闊地區擊破匪之主力。</p>
<p>〔本報徐州廿四日電〕黃海空軍機羣廿四日飛汴東南杞縣·陳留公路及通許至朱仙鎭間作廣泛搜索，匪三三五五之手推事及零星汽車，均爲炸射之主要日標。又匪所搶之開封物資，大部運黃河北岸，一部南運豫東。</p>

<h3>立法院檢討戰局　何應欽指出汴失陷原因並聲明鄭州絕對可確保</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿四日電〕立法院廿四日全日舉行臨時會議，檢討中原戰局。晨九時開曾，孫院長主席，國防部長何應欽偕次長蕭毅肅應邀出席，宣佈開會後，首由何氏作一小時之報告，渠先說明國防部組織法正在修訂中，現在軍事進行依循之原則，翁院長於答覆施政方針之質詢中，已有報告。渠重申國防部長負軍政之責，軍令指揮由參謀總長奉總統之命令行之，而參謀總畏則爲統帥之幕僚長，及國防部長之行政官，平時軍政重於軍令，戰時軍政支特軍令。並謂：參謀總長顧祝同因臨時奉總統召，於晨九時飛往西安，未克出席，關於軍令部分，不能詳細說明。其次，何氏復分析勝利後共軍勢力高速膨脹，其兵員及輕武器已與國軍相若，然於重武器及海空軍仍無法與國軍比擬。至於開封戰役，由失利以至重鎭淪陷，基本原因在於情報工作失敗，及敵情判斷錯誤，然渠强調開封一時失守不能謂爲中原戰爭已全失敗。渠朗讀現在中原戰塲批揮作戰之劉峙·劉汝明等將領之電文，證明國軍現正積極展開殲滅匪部之會戰，以迴轉中原戰局收復開封。最後一再聲明鄭州之確保絕無問題。何氏報告畢，豫籍及華北各省委員多人相繼發言，對開封失守之各項責任問題猛烈抨擊，意見多果中於下列數點：（一）戡亂軍事戰略失當，國軍守地挨打，匪軍則以毀滅國軍戰力爲目標，處處機動，今後應力謀對策；（二）指揮越級，責任不明，運用不憲，必須改正；（三）賞罰不平，士不用命，今後應盡除派系之成見：（四）軍風紀敗壞，地方武力未能充分配合一利用，今後應認眞整肅，並注意地方武力之切實輔助。若干委員對各重要據點，庫存軍需不自利用，盡棄敵手之現象，痛心疾首若干委員指責空軍忽視我方軍民生命，轟炸混戰中之開封城垣實屬不當，大多數委員均要求嚴懲失職之作戰情報人員。全日發言委員達五六十人，何應欽於午後復對各委員之質詢提出答覆，並表示對各委員之建設性意見竭誠接受，然以責任問題難明，多數委員均感不夠滿意，會議至六時始散。</p>

<h3>資金大量逃港四聯專員作事實證明　戰後銀行存款增加數字驚人</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿四日電〕國內資金大量逃港，頃已獲得證明，四聯總處駐港專員徐昌成，近有關於資金大量逃港之調查報告呈報四聯，其中曾列舉若干調查所得之數字，據悉：資金逃港之最大證明，爲戰後銀行存款戶頭及存款數字之驟增，據　　銀行人員透露，戰前該行存戶存款額在一千萬元以上者，不過一二戶，五百萬以上者，十餘戶，百萬以上者亦極有限，戰後之新存戶存款額在一千萬以上者達一千餘戶，五百萬以上者近一萬戶，一百萬以上者，則不計其數，此乃香港外國銀行一家之存款情形，數字堪稱驚人，其在其他銀行存放及經營投資及地產股票者爲數更多，港府在戰後發行無準備金之新港幣共三億元，然一般估計香港市面所需港幣僅五千萬元即足流通，其餘大量數字，當在國人手中，爲經營投資或吸收物資之用。投資方面，如九龍土瓜灣近有人以超過底價數倍之代價數百萬港幣購地及建築工廠。另一滬市富商，則以七十四萬港幣標購九龍地皮，至經營撥匯者更不乏人，凡此諸端，均足證實戰後國內資金確已大量逃港。</p>

<h3>監院行使同意權　總統提名之司·考兩院長副院長四人均獲過半數票通過</h3>
<p>〔中央社南京廿四日電〕總統邪惡四日頒布命令如下：（一）提任王寵惠爲司法院長；（二）提任石志泉爲司法院副院長；（三）提任張伯苓爲考試院長；（四）提任賈景德爲考試院副院長。</p>
<p>〔本報南京廿四日電〕行憲第一屆監察院，廿四日首次依據憲法行使同意權，以無記名投票方式，對總統提名以王寵惠爲司法院長，石志泉副之，張伯苓爲考試院長，賈景德副之，咨請監院同意一案，分別舉行投票，結果，所提四人均獲過半數之同意票通過，即咨答總統。</p>
<p>第九次會</p>
<p>總統之提名咨文，於廿三日送達監院，監院即於廿四日晨九時半舉行第九次會議，予以宣佈。秘書處宣讀總統咨文後，陶百川委員提出臨時動議，略以本院進行同意權舉行全院審查會，並非軍事國防外交之國家機密問題，應無秘密之必要，得許新聞記者列席旁聰。陶氏並加以說明稱：此乃對人而非對事，无秘密可言。並稱，吾人如僅使記者出此門外，則所謂秘密者，亦不過掩耳盜鈴耳。繼有楊令德首先起立發言，表示贊同。惟續有谷鳳翔，梁上棟，劉行之等均表示反對，認爲吾人不能自己打自已嘴巴，自己訂定之法規，竟即予推翻，不應提付表決或討論。當經主席宣稱交全院審查會辦理，大會即於十時　，並即推定黃覺爲全院審查會主席，續開審查會。</p>
<p>全院審會</p>
<p>審查會開始時，主席首先提出秘密會議之問題，當一致主張該案不能成立，不應提付討論。當由主席宣佈，依照同意權行使辦法第二條之規定，全院審查會由委員一人爲主席，基會議以秘密行之。即請除委員以外人士一律退席。</p>
<p>討論時，多數委員認爲總統咨文內容過於簡單，未能如監院所訂之同意權行使辦法所規定附帶履歷及證件，若千委員認爲可以不必附送履歷，因本院之同意權行使辦法，並未送總統備閱，總統並不知悉此附帶條件，而此次提名之王寵惠張伯苓等，不僅爲國內飽學之士，即在國際上亦負盛名，不應提此項條件，如吾人一定欲提出此種苛刻條件，則無異使賢者不願爲，因渠等係被提名，並非自願也，另一部份委員則認爲總統之咨文內未附履歷及證件，乃不遵法行事。爭執數小時，迄午竟至無結果而散。</p>
<p>投票結果</p>
<p>午後，于院長特以此事轉告總統府，旋經總統府趕辦文件，將被提名之四氏之履歷一份送達監院，監院於午後繼續舉行全院審查會，就履歷略加審查後，即宣告完成，並於休息後改開大會，進行投票。本日投票甚爲迅速，出席委員一四六人，發票一四六張，投票一四六張，計（一）王寵惠得同意票一三二張，不同意票十二張，廢票二張。（二）石志泉同意票一二三張，不同意票十入張，廢票五張。（三）張伯苓同意票一二七張，不同意票十六張，廢票三張。（四）賈景德同意票一〇四張，不同意票卅六張，廢票六張。該項結果由于右任於下午六時半宣布，全體監委均熱烈鼓掌。</p>
<p>王　惠　張伯苓　賈景德</p>

<h3>挽回中原戰局的頹勢</h3>
<p>立法院昨晨舉行臨時秘密會議，檢討中原織事失利的原因及關封失陷的責任問題，各委員紛紛發實，無不激昂慷慨，痛陳中原戰局的危急。國防部長何應欽將軍，亦曾應邀列席，對於中原戰局的頹勢，有所說朋，並答覆各立委的質詢。中原戰局今後的演變，確爲全國上下所關心。何部長謂決以全力爭取勝利，我們也但願其如此。因爲今天中國的大局，一切的一切，擊於剿匪軍事的成敗。負軍事責任的當局，眞所謂以一身繁天下之安危。</p>
<p>中原戰事的得失，不特有關河南一省的安危，而且足以影響及整個戰局。開封城內的守軍，經過六晝夜的血戰，已於廿二日正午轉入城郊地區，繼續與城內的匪軍作殊死戰。此一中原名城的淪陷於匪手，今已不可否認，而各路開往的援軍，截至執筆時爲止，自蘭封西進的邱兵團，尚祇開抵開封城郊十里地區，由鄭州東進的國軍，尚在中牟境內與匪軍作戰，經尉氏北上之國軍，亦迄未越過朱仙鎭，所謂國軍三路會師汴城，看上去尚需若干時日。中原戰局的頹勢仍未見好轉，此際我們徒然焦急苦悶，亦無補大局。與其要追究此次中原戰事失利開封淪陷匪手的責任問題，母寗責任軍事當局決心確保鄭州，尅日收復開封，以挽回中原戰局的頹勢之爲愈。</p>
<p>河南是中原戰局中的中心堡壘，尤其是豫省西南，地勢險要，民性强悍，地方武力素有基礎，眞是堡壘的中心堡壘。所以從地理形勢而論，開封淪陷於匪手，不特河南全省淪陷，抑且江·淮·徐·泗之問，亦將感受其成脅。立委馬乘風等建議立院檢討中原戰事失敗原因時，曾發表長篇大諭，大聲疾呼，痛陳保衛開封的重要性，並提出一個觸目驚心的口號，他說：「保不了　省西南，就保不了河南；保不了河南，也就保不了江　！」我們只要從河南全國的戰局，就不難證明他們的呼綴，並不純是危言聳聽。試看山西省，大都份的地方，是匪軍久佔之地，再看冀南，魯西，鄂北，陝南，也幾乎都是匪軍出沒之地，所以開封一且失守，鄭州陷於孤立，若再不能確保，而使此一段的　海鐵路，完全淪陷在匪軍的控制之下，則共匪東西呼應，打成一片，就要把大河南北的國軍，橫加阻隔。果爾，不使中原戰局的惡化，將至不可收拾的地步，而且徐州，西安，以及武漢的防衛，也許要增加不少的困難。所以我們說，中原職事實爲整個戡亂軍事的重大關鍵，決非言過其實。</p>
<p>這次共匪進攻開封之初，一面佯在魯西發動大規摸的攻勢，吸引了大批國軍，而使豫省西南防務空虛；另一而集合陳劉二匪部六萬餘人，乘虛攻入開封城郊。如果國軍情報確實，鬥志堅强，在事前稍有準備，在事後援軍迅發，開封斷無不能久守解圍之理。乃留駐在開封的國軍，僅有兩國人馬，再加以地方保安隊又多槍械不全，以孤單疲憊之軍，抵抗兇惡頑强之匪，何能獨責其久守不退。共匪於十七日抵達開封郊外十里地區，至十九日即突破城防工事而攻入市區，進至巷戰階段，守軍浴血負隅作戰，歷六晝夜之久，始轉入城郊地區而豫省主席劉茂恩氏且聞以身殉職，與城共亡，可見開封之淪陷，守軍之責任尚輕。若於開封守軍死守期間，在鄭州南陽漢中三處的國軍，果能迅速馳援，如命到達，則開封之圍，並非不可解救。即此可知軍令政令的不統一，援軍士氣的頺唐，不能不負中原戰事失利的責任！其實中原戰局的惡化，開始於去年九月間匪軍由豫省西南渡河，嚴重於今年三月間的洛陽失守。可是軍事當局對此，始終沒有提高警覺，僅留國軍兩團駐守開封，而中央方面又忙於召開觀大改組政府，爭位置，奪權利，把軍國大事，反置緩圖，以致中原名城，終告不守。同時，軍事當局對於河南省素有基礎的地方武力，又未能盡力扶權。據立委馬乘風報告，河南地方團隊向中央索取武器彈藥，難如上靑天，又怎能希望這些槍械不全的地方部隊保衛地方？這些已往的錯誤與失策，是值得軍事當局今後深切反省的。往者不誎，來者可追，我們希望軍事當局痛痛快快的改絃更張！</p>
<p>檢討一年來的軍事形勢，共匪勢力日形膨脹，已由游擊戰變爲陣地戰，已由破壞交通綫變爲攻佔大據點。今年三月間共匪攻佔洛陽以及最近攻入開封，就是明證。回頭看看國軍，反而由主動變爲被動，過去尚能固守綫和點，現在連重要的大據點也似乎不能堅守了。儘管軍事當局高唱「總體戰」，但如由今之道，無變今之俗，則因循顢預的結果，軍事頹勢的挽回，也必大感困離。國人對於新任國防部長何應欽參謀總長顧祝同兩將軍，都抱着極大的期望，但是否能挽回目前軍事的頹勢，將視國軍能否會師汴城，振作士氣，收復開封以爲斷了。</p>
<p>我們目擊軍事頹勢的日著，內心早已感到苦悶與憤慨，但我們一直保持械默，不願說出心中的煩惱，徒增讀者對於大局的焦躁。惟在中原戰局危急萬分的今日，天下興亡匹夫有責的今日，我們實在不能無言了。其實今日的軍事問題，說起來也並不複雜，質言之，一個是統一指揮改變戰略的問題；另一個是如何嚴明賞罰，使官兵甘苦相共，以鼓勵前綫的士氣問題。何部長日前也已談及，只可惜還來不及實行。我們但願何部長能以絕大的勇氣和毅力來快幹，實幹，苦幹，務使其整軍計劃能全部貫澈，並願國人支持何部長顧參謀總長，在戡亂建國的共同日標之下，嚴整軍紀，肅淸敗類，使全國上下眞能有力出力，有錢出錢。果能如此，則大局雖危，但在軍事上也不難挽回士氣的頹唐，扭轉惡劣的局勢！</p>

<h3>日本推行土地改革新方案</h3>
<p>— 吳嘉棠</p>
<p>日本的土地改革計劃，正在盟總主持之下，着着推進，其實施之成功及有效，頗堪爲國人所借鏡。改革計劃的目的，在掃除佃租制度的經濟殘酷性，推行的過程中頗爲順利，沒有騷動，也很少經濟脫節的現象。</p>
<p>盟總的基本佔領政策，是阻止日本趨向共產主義，因此土地改革成了一個中心的政策。有一點是難求理解的，就是平常土地改革終是共產黨計劃內最主要的一環，可是日共黨强烈反對土地改革計劃。他們指責保持土地私有制度是資本主義者換湯不換藥的表面改革，主要的目的不是替勞動者謀幸福而是保持資本主義的剝削。</p>
<p>其實日共反對的眞正原因，是盟總實行這種改革之後，把他們手裏的王牌奪了過來，並且毀掉共黨的宣傳籍口。盟總方案的成功，使日本的農民日益不願接受共產黨甘言蜜語的誘惑，個人深感中國土地改革亦急待解決，倘能以性質相類的方案，即日付之實行，當可擊破共黨「王改」的宣傳攻勢，不過我對這個問題素少研究只能提供日本的資料，供有關專家的參考。</p>
<p>日本的極右派份子，當然亦是强烈反對盟總的改革計劃，這批人在日本被解體以前，是一向由大地主持撑着。大地主在那些日子，即是農村的小天皇，壓迫佃農，獻媚軍人，他們所領導的政治活動，充滿了頑固反動和軍國主義的氣息，目的是保持他們的旣得利益及大地主的地位。在另一方面，那個時候，軍人亦以佃農爲政治資本，經常以動人的口號對佃農說只要跟着軍人去走，終有一天能得到自己的土地，再加上戰勝後大日本帝國繁榮的甜言蜜語，使日本農民多年來追隨於他們侵略政策之後。</p>
<p>可是現在盟總方案之實行，已把共黨和極右派份子手裘的王牌同時剝奪。而這個政策方向之正確和實施之練達，值得特別研究。日本土地的總面積是一四二，三一〇方哩，其中百分之十六是可耕的，約合一五，〇〇〇，〇〇〇英畝。全人口的百分之四十入，大槪有六百萬個家庭的收入，是全部或局部來自耕作。每一個家庭平均分到兩英畝半的田地，可是由於耕作過度，地力已减，大都農民皆不足以維持一個家庭的生計。在戰前約有百分之七十的農民是佃農性質，佃戶業主的契約中，普通是規定以實物收成的半數納租，同時佃戶尚須付出肥料設備房租等費用，佃戶的實際收入，僅爲收成的四分之一而已，熟年維持全家的溫飽，已很勉强。如有天災，生計就毫無保障，盟總管制日本，第一件工作就是對土地所有權來一番改革的計劃。一九四五年十二月九日，盟總有一個指令給日本政府，要它採取必要的措施，使農民在他的成品中，獲得比較公道的分配。這個改革計劃的宗旨，溫和而切實，與國父耕者有其田的主張相近。日本土地改革計劃終於在一九四六年十月廿一日在國會內通過。這個方案有兩大目的：（一）將土地的所有權轉移到實際耕種的農民手裏，（二）改善佃租辦法，這個方案强調了土地的私有，而非國有和集體耕作。</p>
<p>我覺得確定土地所有權這點極有意義，因爲這樣以後，盟總就創造了一批小的自耕農，田地雖少而可馮其勞力自由經營。也可以說，每個有一二畝田的農家都是企業家和資本家。如此，這羣小資本家就成了資本主義社會的一個最廣泛，最　革固的基礎。在一個走向共產主義的國家，這眞是最好的藥方，我覺得這個政策本身的理論和實施的步驟，尤其值得國人借鏡。土地改革方案的目標，是使日本五分之四的佃農得自耕其田，實行之初，先由政府以每段（約合十畝）七百五十日元的作價，向地主購　田地，並以廿四年爲期的公債支付價款，公價的年息是三分二厘。政府買進田地，以同一的價格買給佃農，付款是一次付淸和分期付款均可，後者是分三十年付淸，每年利息率是三分二厘，在法案中規定政府有權收購的士地，約爲下列數種：（一）「在外地主」（即日人所謂「不在地主」）所擁有的田地，（二）超過了一定保留標準的租田，（三）自耕農超過保留限額的田地，除非其本人及家屬尚能加以合理的開發，（四）公司擁有的田地，而這些田地與公司的主要營業無直接關係者，（五）土地可用作農業上開墾之用者。此外，改革方案並規定一九四五年十一月廿三日前在當地耕作之佃農，有購買田地的最高優先權。</p>
<p>爲推行這個改革計劃起見，每一個農村均設立一農田委員會，委員均自農民中選出。其中佃農自耕農地主所佔的人數比例，是五：二：三。每一類都自由選出其代表，參加會議。每一個道的委員會指導監督縣委員會的工作，而道委員會本身則受中央土地委員會的指導，後者由農林大臣担任主席。我想計觀的順利推進，實得力於實施方式之民主。同時方案內復規定，如農人因收成不佳或其他正當理由，不能履行分期付款時，政府亦不能質押其田地。這辦法亦不准佃農轉變成爲大地主，而田地限麵標準之決完，是依據土地之可耕性。普通限度是七英畝半。</p>
<p>在這個方案之下，目前耕作六百四十萬英畝的佃農，將變成耕種四百九十萬英畝的自耕農。整個剷除佃農制度是認爲尚行不通，但是佃租制度已大加改良。法律上現在規定：（一）須有書面租契，（二）規定稻田的最高租額是收成的百分之二十五，高地是百分之十五，（三）租額以現金支付，（四）租契的變更和取消，須經農田委員會的通過。</p>
<p>根據我搜集的資料來觀察，土地改革方案雖推行不久，但進行順利。盟總的負責人員亦告訴我：一切照預定進度實施。土地收購自去年三月卅一日實行，一年之內政府共購進三，九八〇，〇〇〇英畝的耕田，而其中已有六入八，一四八英畝的田地轉售給農民了。在方案實行過程中，舞弊的事件也有，但是在大體上，日本人和盟總負責人員對方案的順利實行，均表滿意。大地主當然對這計劃不會高興，但是他們知道盟總全力支持這個方案，亦只能接受。</p>
<p>我和麥帥晤談時，曾提到這個土地問題，麥帥指出：土地改革是任何佔領政府的基本政策，他亦記得遠在羅馬凱撒時代，即在其佔領的土地上，推行土地改革。不過，當一個政府財力支絀無力收購田地時，推行土地政策是很困難的。從他的談話中，不難看出在日本進行的各項改革中，土地改革是麥帥希望能垂之久遠的。</p>

<p>〔路透社費城廿三日電〕參議員范登堡已於今日表示同意，被提名爲候選總統之競選人，范登堡此一行動使塔虎脫及史泰遜等其他競舉者深感興奮。彼等相信，范登堡之名必可吸引原擬投向紐約州長杜威之許多票數。在舉行首次投票以選舉候選總統之前，塔虎脫及史泰遜之支持者多方努力仍不獲使杜威失去提名競爭中之領導地位，塔史兩氏之支特者，昨竟日開會以岡結成制止杜威之聯盟。塔史本人，昨日及今晨亦數度舉行秘密會議，初次投票於屋期一晨即開始舉行，史泰遜雖向記者表示杜威不能獲得被提各之多數，然若干人數較多之代表團均已表示支持杜威，如三十三人之密蘇里州代表團及三十五人之新澤西代表團，均表示將支特杜威。</p>

<h3>英商電車一度怠工　工人提出六項要求　遵令復常靜待調處</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕昨晨大雨傾盆中，英商電車公司工人怠工，所有各路電車及無軌電車，均未出廠，全體工人集於常德路及提籃橋車廠。吳市長聞訊，電令社會局限電車於二小時內恢復常態。經社會局副局長趙班斧曁勞工處長沈鼎召集該公司工會代表剴切勸導後，全體工人爲尊重政府法令，於昨午十二時二十分起，先後復工，靜待解決。</p>
<p>據悉：該公司工人發生怠工之原因有三：（一）七屆全運會舉行時，該公司八八一號售票，一五三號查　，曁一三〇號司機，膺選為國術摔角賽代表，當時會出市敎育局通知公司當局請給予公假，並由社會局批令公司照付三人在全運會期間工資，但公司當局迄未遵行。（二）公司方面陰謀破壞工會，離間工人感情，最近公司呈請社會局將高級職員四人退出工會，經社會局批准二人，此二人即由公司當局各加底薪三十元，以示優待。（三）代理車務總管英人麥特生，任意將二七七號售票闕大松，及一二〇九號售票舒貴卿兩人開革，闕舒二人向麥請求復職，又被麥及另一英籍職員高士登，將針貴鄕痛毆，頭部血流如注。</p>
<p>由於上述原因，激起工人公憤於前日午後向公司當局提出要求六項：（一）撤換並懲辦車務總管麥特生，（二）處分四三三號記時員，（三）恢復售票員一二〇九號及二七七號之職務，（四）禁止聽取不負責任無事實根據「冷報」，（五）開革退出工會職工，（六）從速照付參加全運會代表工資。上項條件提出後，公司方面無具體答覆，逐有昨日之怠工發生。</p>
<p>工會代表　返廠勸導</p>
<p>工會理事長仇長江，曁理事鄭仰大，周慶芳等三人，於昨晨十時許晋謁社會局趙副局長。趙對工人受麥特生之壓迫，極表同情，惟電車關係市民交通甚鉅，勸令三代表先行勸導全體工人復工，以免影響全市交通。經三代表返廠向全體工人剴切勸導後，工人深明大義，遵守政府法令，忍痛先行復工，結果常德路車廠各車即於中午十二時二十分先行駛出，提籃橋車廠五路電車之最末一輛，亦於午後二時四十五分駛出。</p>
<p>社局勸告　公司方面</p>
<p>趙副局長於昨日午後召見該公司人事總管英人卡納爾等談話，對工人所提各項條件，有所詢問。據趙副局長事後語記者稱：（一）關於撤換麥特生事，係該公司之行政問題，社局未便干涉，但已向公司方面警告，須以和善態度對待工人。（二）被開革之查票員，待查明原因後再核辦。（三）取消「冷報」一節，亦已向公司勸告。（四）退會職員如確係由公司加給彼等底薪，頗爲不當，應予减除。（五）參加全運會工人工資，公司應予如數發給。</p>

<h3>我國鐵道史上創舉　豪華「冷氣火車」　定期行駛京滬綫</h3>
<p>〔本報特寫〕生活在漫天烽火中，整天爲最低限度的生活需要而爭扎的人們，幾乎不相信在這個時代裏還能聽到進步與建設的消息，然而這是千眞萬確的事實，兩路局戚數堰機廠正在建造一列我國未曾前有的「冷無火車」，它的設備構造和性能，均可媲美目前在歐美鐵道上行駛的第一流火車，它所需用的材料，隊了極少量的特殊機件，是化外匯買來的，其餘百分之九十五，都是自已拼撰出來的，所以在成本上便宜了不少，據他們估計每一輛「冷氣火車」的成本約合美金五萬元，若向美國車商訂購呢？十五萬美金一輛還不肯在短期內交貨。</p>
<p>混然一體帆布密封</p>
<p>「冷氣列車」是流綫型的，大圓頭，小圓尾，兩車接連處，用厚帆布密封，遠遠望去混然一體，不能一節一節很淸楚的分出，帆布用强力彈簧拉緊，所以左右轉灣，運轉裕如，車窗用雙層玻璃製成嵌入車壁，不能開啓，以免傳熱，每輛客車兩端各有車門，旅客上下時車門開啓，小鋼梯自勸伸出放下，車門關閉，小梯則自動縮起藏於車底，玲瓏巧妙。列車顏色，路局特請中央大學美術系陳敎授設計，車頂漆銀灰色，以下炎紅色與奶油相間，最下爲軍綠，色澤鮮艷而富藝術化。</p>
<p>發電量共為一百瓩</p>
<p>列車共分九節，第一輛機車，第二輛是發電軍，以後一連三輛客車，三輛客車之後隔一輛飯車，飯車後面又是二輛客車，最末是一輛瞭望車。發電軍中裝着一具小型强力發電機，發電量一百瓩，剛够供給全列車冷氣，電灶，電燈，電冰箱等電力的需要。發電軍中空餘地位附設行李，郵政及車長室，每部份都有鐵門隔絕，以策安全。</p>
<p>裝有活動沙發座位</p>
<p>客車有二大特色，一是冷氣，二是活動沙發座位，冷氣機也是小型的，不過四隻座位那麼大，每輛客車各裝一具。沙發座彷照中航公司空中　王號中安樂椅加以改良，除能將靠背起仰調節外，且可以將靠背反拉過來，使座位反向，因車中座位係順次排列，如此可使相熟旅客如普通火車座之相對而坐，每一客車設座位五十個，對號入座，號數製於椅背項上，椅背邊另有一特備放置軍票之鐵邊小框，旅客入座後，將車票插入框中，然後閉目養神，小會再有查票員來打擾你了。</p>
<h3>瞭望車中　供客閒眺</h3>
<p>飯車與瞭望車都有冷氣，飯軍餐廳備有桌子十個，可容三十二人同時進餐，瞭望軍中設有小酒吧一座，供應酒饌冷飲品，佈置悉仿國際，金門酒吧間股計，末端有十隻可轉動的單人沙發，供旅客閒眺沿路景色，還有收音機五架，任旅客隨意收聰。</p>
<p>這列我國鐵路史上唯一豪華究美的火車，將在七月十五日在京滬綫上行駛，每天來往京滬間一次，票價較凱旋號增二成或三成未定，現正由三百餘工人日夜趕工油漆裝配中。</p>

<h3>現鈔汎濫籌碼增加　物價昨再告飛揚　北方游資大量南流行局差出</h3>
<p>中央銀行爲穩定物價，決定大量拋售物資吸收游資，抽緊銀根，其方式將以糖煤米及紗布等同市塲拋售，故前日四行二局差進達二萬九千一百六十億元之空前新紀錄。昨日上午銀根頗爲緊俏，但下午忽傳國行差出八千億之消息，同時凍結於各輪船上之華北南流之資金，大量登陸，現鈔籌碼增加，因此股票，紗布，及其他已告穩平之物價，又告上漲。</p>
<p>昨日本市銀行，因受北方游資大量流滬影響，呈現明緊暗鬆之象，銀錢業票據交換中，四行兩局一庫又復一反前日大量差進之情况，而有大額差出，總計共八五四三億。計中央銀行差出二一一億，交通銀行差出五一五億，中信局差出四八三億，其他農民，郵匯局，等則有差進。計農民銀行差進九六億，郵匯局差進一五九億，中央合作金庫差進二一四億，商業行莊大交換差進四二六一億，小交換差進五八九億，外商銀行差進三六九三億。</p>
<h3>業外刺激又起　華股後市蓬勃　外股漲勢轉强統債平定</h3>
<p>華股昨晨盤有金融陰影，銀根威脅而趨疲，但業外之興高彩烈，迫使反動轉烈。五和華新等漲停，永紗亦以高檔結束。</p>
<p>晨初以人心仍受銀根暗影而不掁，永紗以四〇五〇元上塲，升爲四〇九〇元，五和新股買戶買意興奮，即告漲停板，紗布漲後起回，代辦費用高爲四五元及五〇元，下降至三九九〇元低價。後又被進至四〇九五元高價，近午退爲四〇四〇元，午收爲四〇六五元。較前收計五和漲停，商務新華榮豐景綸跌半成，華豐信誼統益閘北均平外，餘均微挫。</p>
<p>後市業業外刺激益甚，永紗開高至四一入〇元，一再被進至四二九〇元，國行差出，華新掛漲停，漲到四四〇〇元收市。美亞漲停後有回，大通臨收告漲停，較晨收計五和華泥大通均漲停，美亞景綸新華內衣榮豐華豐景福漲一成强，餘均好起半成。塲外各未上市股票，以銀行文化股見痰，公用紡織股則平。</p>
<p>外股　昨漲勢逐漸　强，晨盤回港電報平，不過維特穩定而已，後市終起反勸，怡紗目八三〇萬之價，開後步昂至八入五萬收市。洋行力扒，散戶則出，橡皮股更俏。較前收計會德豐怡陣微升，怡紗英聯業廣紙版航業鋼業均好半成。</p>
<p>公債　昨較安靜，統丙晨開五〇萬，先低至四七萬，繼又升至五二萬，而後稍平，成交四百萬，與前收相較均見平定。</p>
<h3>當局注意　旅行支票</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕近日本市行莊爲應付實際需要起見，頗多開發旅行支票，流通市面，金管局對此深爲注意。內部人士表示：如此項支票之運用方法影響市塲時，將加以有效之制止。</p>
<p>又訊：日來央行復致力於抽緊銀根，行莊頭寸時咸缺乏；央行已允將存於該行之定期存款，及行莊所購之短期國庫券，抵充交換差額。</p>
<h3>結滙認明書　昨創新高價</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕結匯證明書昨日之售價，又告激漲。晨開一〇五萬，以買氣旺盛，市價即節上升，由一一〇萬而創一一五萬之記錄。成交數額則以一一〇萬時爲最衆。各指定銀行中，花旗中國滙豐等均有賣出，其中中國銀行一家即售出三十萬美金以上。據估計自新結滙辦法實施以來，赴指定銀行結售者，巳達一千五百萬美元。</p>
<h3>華僑監委鄺瑤普　盼改善僑匯政策</h3>
<p>並准僑胞購運物資返國</p>
<p>〔中央社南京廿四日電〕唯一返國出席監察院會議之華僑監察委員鄺瑤普，發表談話，對僑匯及僑資內移，希望政府重訂優良辦法，蓋我國僑匯每年約二億至三億美元，如有妥善政策，運用適當，對平衡我國國際收支收效極大，但現在中央銀行牌價與黑市相去幾達兩倍，因此僑匯幾全部逃至香港。</p>
<p>我國一方而號召僑資內移，而又不許僑胞以原有外匯資金購運物資進口，生產物資如機器原料等，亦受種種限制，似此僑資雖欲內移，亦無路可通。故希望輸出入管理委會准許僑胞以其在外國積聚之資財，購運利於我國建設之物資進口。此舉即可獎勵僑資內移，而對國家之生產建設，必有莫大補助。</p>
<h3>港進出口統計</h3>
<p>〔中央社香港廿三日電〕香港進出口司統計局今宣佈：香港五月份進出口貿易，入超達港幣五千四百七十萬〇七千四百六十元，本年一月至五月進口總值，共達八億〇七百十入萬四千餘港幣，出口總值爲五億九千一百九十八萬餘港幣。</p>

<p>國行稽核處頃發表，四月份本市各行莊，（包括華商銀行一四五家，外商銀行十二家，錢莊七八家，行莊信託部及信託公司四二家，行莊儲蓄部五五家），資產負債總數及存放款統計如次：（一）資產總數，二，四四〇，五六〇，二一七；（二）負債總數二，三三四，三九五，四一七；（三）存款總數八一九，一八九，入七〇；（四）放款總數七四〇，〇七入，六七三。（一律以萬元爲單位。）</p>
<h3>行局儲款保證金　按月彙總繳付</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕國家行局曾呈請免繳儲蓄存款保證準備金，頃悉財部巳電覆國行及四聯　處，不准所請，謂仍應遵照規定，按月調整一次，准由各行局彙總繳付，並得以政府債券扺繳。</p>
<p>又央行前據各分行處，轉准各地郵匯局函請　繳儲蓄存款保證準備金，亦經財部電覆，以郵匯局亦爲國家行局之一，存款之性質亦無不同，故保證準備金亦應與其他國家行局同樣繳存。</p>
<h3>客帮搜購交易熱鬧　棉紗布一致轉俏</h3>
<p>昨日棉紗市况，初以六底日近，銀根緊迫，交易沉寂。四十二支藍鳳細紗開盤稍升五百萬元，嗣因塲內套利交易熱鬧，市更堅挺。步高至六億六千五百萬元結束，比上日軋漲一千萬元。其餘四十支卅二支二十支十六支等粗細紗，市亦一致回俏。</p>
<p>昨日棉布市况，因原料缺乏，傳紗廠有减工之訊，市上銀根雖緊，廣帮續有搜購，同業買賣籌碼轉枯，人心看好。十二磅龍頭細布，晨開即告微秀，旋有廣帮力進元嗶嘰甚夥，斯時紗價亦俏，檯面帮乘機拉抬，市盤一路上竄至一千四百八十萬元收盤，較上日回漲一百十五萬元。其他各布行情亦均軋漲甚鉅。</p>
<h3>人絲買多狂漲</h3>
<p>人造絲昨市始疲終且狂躍，較上日大一億元造成新高價。一二〇號金三馬有光，上午開盤七億三千萬元，降至二千五百萬元有成交。片刻間買氣又呈蓬勃，喊價一路上揚，午收高至八千五百萬元隔日期價，下午開盤即出八億元關外，升至三千萬元後一度挫回，最後收盤又漲至八億四千五百萬元賣出價。</p>
<p>廠經昨市上午尚稱平定，高零担九億元有一二担成交，下午因人絲狂升，人心上揚，D字等級漲至九億六千萬元做開價，最後喊價再見高峯，C字等級叩近十億元，二八分干經零担達入億元關口，惟均無交易做開。</p>
<h3>棉紡業擬行減工　紗管會加以</h3>
<p>阻</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕本市棉紡業近因原料不繼，擬减產百分之二十；紗管會以减產如成爲事實，不惟刺激物價，且將影響外銷，已設法勸阻。同時催促美援棉花早日運華，並加緊收購，繼續配售。</p>
<h3>各地商情</h3>
<p>無錫　〔本報無錫廿四日電〕今晨雷雨傾盆，各物先疲後堅，尤以棉紗漲風最烈，竟跳起一億元之多。白粳做開二二入六萬元，白元一三七六萬元，埠秈一三六五萬元，粳稻六一入萬元，小麥一〇九〇萬元，白麥一一二〇萬元，荳油三〇五〇萬元，麵粉四五〇萬元，棉紗五七〇〇〇萬元。</p>
<p>蘇州　〔本報蘇州廿四日電〕蘇州今日米價續漲，市塲做開上糙粳一二四五萬元，門售次貨白米市價一四〇〇萬元，上白米售價混亂，依據糙粳成本及正常利潤計算，在一千六百萬元以上。</p>
<p>合肥　〔本報合肥二十三日電〕昨起此間物價趨疲，食米由一七〇〇萬今降至一五〇〇萬，紗布五洋亦見小跌，惟米價仍較京滬爲高。</p>
<p>濟南　〔本報濟南二十三日電〕濟物價二十三日續見回跌，頭等麵粉跌至四三五萬一袋，二十支蜘蛛紗四億三五〇〇萬一件，黃金暗市每兩一億四千萬，其餘捲烟生油等亦下跌。</p>
<h3>產地步漲人心堅昂　食米價又回升　粉糧油餅均在高襠盤旋</h3>
<p>米市東告回升，因無錫等產地價格續漲，致人心堅昂，又以天氣下雨，到貨减少，貨主更趁機扳價，市乃重振。尤以北市塲上漲較力，白粳高達一千四百五十萬，計漲六十萬元。薄稻漲七十萬，爲一千四百三十萬元。南市塲各檔粳秈初漲五十萬，後市銷滯轉平，約升三四十萬，糙秈米達一千一百萬，故限價秈米無交。白元升六七十萬元，民調會昨拋米六千石，價格未動，二市到貨三四一五石。</p>
<p>麵粉早挺後回，結果老車，兵船略見軋升，晨開貨主扳持至力，老車，兵船各開四百四十萬元。惟後以銀根仍緊，廠方吐售甚多，乃告步落。老車，兵船退爲四百三十萬元外，微升三四萬。紅蜂，建成軋平，麩皮略挫三四萬，小麥未開出。</p>
<p>雜糧大致轉堅，黃豆因到貨稀少，產地價昂，故貨主扳持更力，終告挺升二十萬元。苞米交易冷落，價少榮辱，一元麥北帮納而不急，到源接踵，挫落十萬。新菀豆已有登塲，客帮去化尚暢。紅糧絕少交易，茶豆略有變化，價呈呆定。新蠶平定，芝蔴疲二三十萬，生仁挫五十萬。</p>
<p>食油緩緩回升，各糧俱告轉堅，貨主心思亦告堅昂，市勢止疲而挺。大有豆油二千九百萬，大統等豆油二八八〇萬，各升約三四十萬。生油挺五十萬，吉桶生油四千〇五十萬，惟以豆油交易爲多。生菜油亦回挺三五十萬元，生蔴油站三千六百二十萬高價，小車蔴油喊四千萬萬未成交，豆餅亦告挺升，壽字餅三三一萬，約升五六萬。</p>

<p>新醫與新藥</p>
<h3>告別讀者</h3>
<p>— 梁俊青</p>
<p>因爲要配合着戡亂建國和節省紙張的關係，我們這個醫刋已經決定於七月一日起隨同本報的其他週刊一齊休刊了。這眞是一件非常可惜的事情！</p>
<p>這過去的一年多以來，我們曾經拘定了一種宗旨「用深入淺出的方法，把世界上最新的醫藥介紹給我們的讀者」，雖然在事實上不敢說是有若何成功，可是自經本刋問世之後，便得着無數讀者們的贊助和鼓勵，我們每天都要收到許許多多的讀者來信。這可見讀者們愛護本刋的熱忱了。我們撫心自問，怎能不要格外地奮勉和努力！所以我們也正在計劃着將來改良本刋的種種計劃：例如短評的撰述，世界醫藥的簡單介紹，病人的自述，以及病家的問答等等，我們都想用輕快明朗的筆調，在整齊劃一的短篇文字中叙述出來。在我們的手裏還有幾篇文字如「傷寒症的最新療法」，「小兒溺尿症的原因及其療法」，「變形性多關節炎的原因和療治方法」，以及「初期肺結核症的最新診斷方法」等等，對於讀者們都是非常有裨益的短篇文字，可是老天不肯從人願，只得跟着本刊的休刊而不能和讀者見面了。所以這也是一件非常可惜的事情！</p>
<p>好，不說也罷！多說徒然是增加傷感的。但願我國能夠早日太平，或許我們能夠在本報，或則其他的報上，再能有重見的日子！</p>
<h3>關係愛培撤之副作用及其使用方法</h3>
<p>— 梁俊青</p>
<p>但是因爲這種銅製劑的毒性甚大，注射後往往有嘔吐瀉洩腹痛以及腎臟炎等等，大家都不敢試用，所以銅製齊也逐漸趨於淘汰之列。後來有Ritter氏者重新加以化騐，方才曉得銅劑在人體內並不是能够殺滅結核菌，反之它如果是和某種有機體結合，那末它不但無一傷於人而且可以刺激人體內的網狀　膜御胞（Reticulo　Eodothelien）使它發生出種免疫作用和抗毒作用，籍此可以使病症逐漸好轉，而逐漸痊愈。Ritter氏首先發表他用銅質製劑療治卅位肺結核症患者的經過情形，結果非常滿意。於是重新引起許多學者的注意，計自一九四十至一九四二年間有Arlldr，Ritter，Manttarsch諸人先後發表論著稱許銅劑的功效。德國拜耳公司因此製造一種銅製劑初名Cuyrian，後來改名Ebesal（即愛培撤），曾經無數的醫師加以使川，結果，皆有美滿的成績。從前有一位國立同濟大學的內科敎授德人費納煦博士也有一篇諭文發表歷述銅製劑治療肺結核症的效力。可惜當時因爲在淪陷時期，大家都漠不關心，勝利後因爲德國失敗，德國拜耳公司的藥品作爲敵產被封，以致　人過問，成爲冷門貨，眞正爲它呌屈！</p>
<p>筆者對於「愛培撒」也曾有十數症例，結果除了一位急性的肺結核症沒有功效之外，其賒的都有很美滿的成績。不過它也有種種的副作用，必須注意：（一）在注射後可以有輕微的或較高的發熱；（二）全身可以非常疲倦，或則頭暈頭痛；（三）如果注射相隔的次數太近，那末可以發生咽喉炎，疼痛不堪；（四）有時可以發生腎廠炎；（五）銅質注射入體之後，多半儲積於肝藏和脾臟內，然後於二個月內方始逐漸後腸內排洩出來。因此如果注射太多，或則注射的相隔時期太近，那末它可以引起中毒現象。</p>
<p>至於它的使用方法呢？我以爲應該　意下述的幾點。</p>
<p>（一）在使用前必須爲病者嚴密地檢查如照愛克司光，檢騐白血球分類和計數，紅血球沉降反應以及痰內結核菌等，必須斷定其爲初期性抑或硬結性之結核症方可使用。</p>
<p>（二）仿單上所述的用法是不可靠的。每次的注射必須配合病者的身體狀况方才不致　事。最好是每一種的份量至少用二次例如0.01者用二次後才可於第三次時增加至第二種份量。</p>
<p>（三）每次注射的時期不可太近，至少相隔四天或則七天八天，以反應之輕重及身體之情况而定</p>
<p>（四）假使注射總量達到0.8或則7.2gm日時千萬勿再注射，必須於休息二個月後方可重新使用。</p>
<p>關於愛培撒的優點我可以簡略地附述如下：</p>
<p>（一）除了上述的幾點必須禁忌之外，它的適應範圍非常廣大。</p>
<p>（二）如果不能注射空氣針及外科手術有障礙時，它可以替代之</p>
<p>（三）它的價錢非常便宜，貧苦的病人都可以使用（預料共用三劑每劑十針左右，共計卅針而且在十二個內注射卅針，病人所受一的痛苦甚少。</p>
<p>（四）病者於注射後胃口增加，熱度下降，咳嗽减少，痰液减少，對於病者的心理非常有利。</p>
<p>以上是我對於「愛培撤」的忠實看法。只要它被醫師們好好地去使用，那末它是最經濟而最妥善的肺結核症專劑。（續完）</p>
<h3>蛇毒治羊癎風</h3>
<p>— 蒼龍</p>
<p>誰都曉得羊癎風是一種難治的病症。好好地一個正在工作（或則讀書）的人忽然的兩眼發直，口吐白沫，兩手兩脚僵硬地在抽筋，遇着病症發作得厲害的時候，簡直就是不知人事，昏死過去，一直要經過一二小時之後方始回復常態。這種病症「發作」之後仍然又是和普通人一樣，絲毫沒有什麼特別的症象可得。道時候假使你想要去醫治它呢，那簡直是無法可想。你儘管去給他服食溴劑，　草劑和Luminal　Chloral之類，但是除了稍能减輕它的「發作」之外，就簡直也無法可想。但是假使你隨它去罷，不再去理它了，那未這個病症越發越重，結且也越來越近。萬一病者是在樓梯邊上下國則在汽軍或火車事上落，或則是乘船擺渡時病症發作，那末病者就會有跌死或溺死的危險。所以談到了羊癎風的醫治間題，有許許多多的醫者都在搖頭。</p>
<p>自從美國菲拉合爾菲亞地方的Dr．R．Sprangler氏於一九二九年發表了一篇諭文用蛇畫毒治愈了羊癎風病症之後，立刻就有許多學者跟着在研究。在歐美各國的學者中先後有許多的學者著文推許它的效用。德國的Dr．Fitz　Simons氏且有一本專著詳細討論蛇毒的功效。現在的美國聽說也有許多的醫師使用蛇毒去醫治羊癎風症了。據一九四六年出版的美國Gutman氏編輯的近世醫療大詞典內所載，蛇毒共有兩種，一種是有止血作用的，一種是有止痛和制止神經活動的作用的（Neurotoxisch）。這種Neurotoxisch的作用現在就被人利用來治療羊癎風症，結果成績非常美滿，如果不是外傷性的羊癎風症，那末大半有痊愈的希望。假使是外傷性呢，它也可以减輕許多，把它的發作時减少至數月一次或一年一次云。</p>
<h3>醫藥新知</h3>
<p>— 蒼龍</p>
<p>用空氣注入腹腔內療治腸癆</p>
<p>此法在美國早已有人試用，且有成效。現據J．Med．Lyon．1947．第廿八期報告，Vachon氏及Feit氏亦曾加以實驗，結果成績非常美滿，值得介紹。據稱此法甚少危險，每隔二天或四天或隔七天注入八百西西於腹腔內。在四五月內常須保持其八百西西空氣在腹腔內（因空氣在腹腔內可以逐漸爲腹膜吸收而日益减少其份址，故須隨時補入）。患者於注入空氣數次後即覺病勢减輕，瀉洩减少，腹漲腹痛以及腸嗚等等症象亦隨之减輕，胃口轉好，體東增加，其肺內之結核病灶亦爲之好轉云。</p>
<p>狹心症之最新療法</p>
<p>據去年之英國醫學雜誌刋載（P．4532地方之A．A．Fitrgerald　Peel氏曾經用「阻止血液凝結」之藥物Dicumarol療治狹心症，結果成績甚佳。惟據氏稱，僅用此藥亦不易見效必須用時注入葡萄糖溶液與生理食　水再加以Cardophyllin或Euphyllin於靜脈內（作點滴式注入法）方可發生效力，蓋有許多狹心症患者往往於狹心症發作時立即發生虛脫作用而不易救治，故必須用上述方法兼治其心臟之虛脫作用方始有效云。</p>

<h3>武嶺蔣氏系考序</h3>
<p>— 蔣中正</p>
<p>〔編者按：蔣總統之祖先出於周公，實爲最近之一發現。頃本報獲總統所著武嶺蔣氏先系考序一文，係總統親撰，用宣紙親書，將在奉化蔣氏家譜中刋入。本報得首先刊載，不勝光榮。〕</p>
<p>左氏傳云，凡蔣邢茅胙祭，周公之胤；我蔣氏出於周公，信而有繳。惟譜牒散佚，世系　略，常以文默不足爲憾。民國三十二年十一月，先太夫人入十生辰紀念，適長兒經國遺人從故鄕倭寇重聞中密携宗譜，間道入贛，展轉遂達於重慶，余三復循誦，幾忘寢食，追念先太夫人茲德之隆，益切報本之思。舊譜列叙世次，自五代時延恭公始，由是而上，或云來自天台，或言舊居括蒼，未能詳也。自對日抗戰勝利還都以來，乃假集江浙各地同宗譜牒，參校研覈，仍苦無端緒，蓋年　代遠，書闕有間久矣。嗣有天合宗人以家藏舊鈔本能山蔣氏家譜相示，龍山者，在寗海，與天台諸蔣統系不相屬，不知其譜何由入天台。譜中則有摩訶公金紫公一支，且載金紫公以下數世葬奉化禽孝鄕三嶺，余大喜慰，惜其纂例未嚴，非出學者之手，所系世次，亦有　入旁支及時代顚倒之誤，孤本傳鈔，未敢遽以爲信。久之，乃從鄞縣橫山蔣氏舉化峨陽蔣氏兩譜中發見延恭公摩訶公兩世之名，而延恭公之父諱顯，嘗爲四明監鑒官，實始遷明州。大父諱達，兄弟四五人，皆用是旁爲名，校以臨海黃巖仙居諸蔣之譜，皆有此兄弟之名，雖其間序次略有出入，而諸譜纂例較優，且各本符合，宜較龍出譜爲可信。於是參互鈎稽，詳加考訂，上起漢兗州刺史元卿公，下與舊譜相銜接，確有世次可考者，凡得三十有三世，系明緒正，覆覈無稱遺誤，足慰平生溯源追本之志。乃復進而探索我世居與遷徙之迹，其有史籍可證者，周初始封蔣國，後爲楚期思邑，劉宋改稱樂安，趙宋爲光州仙居縣，即今河南固始縣境，漢時蔣氏子孫遷居杜陵，迨元卿公四世孫面亭鄉侯少明公，始遷陽羨，入傳至晋吳郡太守伯機公，轉遷台州，又二十傳乃遷明州，其大較如此。自元卿公以上，距周初始封之世，又千餘年。宜興臨海大台諸譜詳載世系各爵，究整無闕，顧於史無徵，未敢茍同，謹附闕疑之例，以待異日之續訂。鳴呼！自五季亂後，故家右族，譜牒淪亡，歐陽氏爲唐書宰相世系表，稱述先代，大抵近引梁陳魏周而止，更不遠溯漢晋，我蔣氏猶能及今考尋先米，上逮漢世，二千年來，一脈相承，罔有闕失，何幸如之。夫民族之學，我國所重，雖幾更亂離，舊籍舛互，而留心考索，則本源固自可溯也。今歲戊子，吾族重修宗請，特聘武進吳先生爲總裁，主其事，慈谿陳君布雷鄞縣沙君文若爲編纂，襄其成。余敬覽先系考，脈絡分明，考訂精審，竊喜其能發前人所未發，得償余多年之宿願，爰爲之序。詩有之，夙興夜寐，無忝爾所生。書曰，黍稷匪馨，明德維馨，我蔣氏世世子姓，其念之哉！中華民國三十七年六月十一日遷四明第一一十八世孫周泰謹序並書於南京。</p>

<p>筆者雖非川人，但却也在川省聰過川戯。記得在軍慶第一次聰川戯時，是在一次盛大的招待會上。酒罷三巡，主人歡迎詞，遠客答謝詞，都一一來過了，驀然震天價大鑼聲從隔院屯喧鬧起來，「狂狂狂」、「湯湯湯」，幾乎把我們的耳膜也震陂了。</p>
<p>接在令人心慌的鑼聲之後又是一陣悽厲的大喇叭呌，這就是「鬧台」，川戯之所以又名爲高腔者，大約就因爲聲調十分激越高亢九的原故吧。至於絲竹絃管檀板之類，也一一齊全，有如秦腔漢曲，有時悽楚悲凉，有時爽利淸脆，仍不失其在藝術上的價值。</p>
<p>那一大，我們聽到了賈培之的鬚生，陳碧秀的靑衣，薛艷秋的花且，所唱的戲，有昭君出塞，後帳會，梅能鎭，宮人井，霸王別姬等歷史名劇，事實雖和京戯差不多，但詞句完全兩樣，據說賈培之在川劇中的聲譽，等於京劇中之有馬迎良，陳碧秀也有些像梅蘭芳。花旦薛艷秋是女的，和當時京劇中雪艷琴的聲譽相等。</p>
<p>有一個和京劇中簫長華地位差不多的，呌唐廣體，在川中最能呌座，那一夭他雖然沒右到塲，可是後來我仍然在劇院中看到了他。他生平的長處就在打彈說白，人長得很胖，又極富風趣，一言一動，台下人莫不爲之捧腹。</p>
<p>此外，川劇老輩，有一個名呌康子林的，是一個俠骨義腸的好漢。他是武把子，打功最好，年紀活到七十幾了，觀衆們還硬要强他登台，他雖然武藝好，究竟體力不濟了；竟於某次做一塲最賣力的戯，在台上跌了一交，下場得病，不久就死了！他死時，不但伶人們如喪考妣的哭他，社會上人士，亦幾乎每個人都要爲之揮淚，可見他感人的力量之大了。康的弟子極多，坤角也不少，年靑時因爲敎女弟子武藝，常有和女性接觸的機會，戀慕他的坤角不知有多少，然而康束身自愛，一　不染。</p>
<p>關於川劇脚本的編製，如最享盛名也最廣流傳的「琴探」之類，唱曲和說白的詞句，都極其雅馴，是出之於川中老名士趙熙（堯生）的改撰，川省人幾乎個個會唱幾句，有如北京城裏黃包車夫之都會唱幾句探母坐宮一樣。這眞是上品的民間文藝啊！</p>
<p>不知張岳軍先生所聽的是那幾種戯？現在又有那一些新進的名角登台獻藝了？子林老死，堯生猶在，緬懷往事，恨不得再度入川，一過川劇之　！</p>
<h3>吳愙齋日記</h3>
<p>— 錢大成</p>
<p>予平生最喜閱名人日記，尤嗜有關掌故者。昨友人曹菊生先生出示所藏吳憲齋「奉使吉林日記」，紅格手稿本，每半葉九行，每行字不等，版心上端有「靑雲　　偶鈔」六字，共三十五葉，空白二葉，有「十將軍印齋」一印。十將軍印齋者，乃　齋書齋名，在吳縣雙林巷，王懿榮書額。此日記記自同治六年庚辰四月二十一日，至十二月十九日。時愙齋以三品鄕銜，隨吉林將軍銘安辦理邊防。淸史稿稱：憲齋周歷要隘，始知琿春黑頂子地，久爲俄入侵占，因請淸廷頒舊界圖，將定期與俄官抗議，未得旨。時有韓效忠者，（按效忠原名邊外，招撫後乃改名。）聚衆四五萬於吉林夾皮溝，　抗淸軍。憲齋單騎抵其巢、留宿兩日，效忠乃降；奏給五品頂戴。日記所載，詳恙無比。愙齋入山招降日，且改服旗裝，時在十二月下旬。錢基博先生曾爲文記其事。顧起潛先生輯憲齋年譜，亦未見此醫。惹齋另有日記日皇華紀程者，刻入「殷禮在斯堂叢書。」北征日記，則亦手稿，藏於其文孫湖帆先生所。菊生得此書於表叔曾雨蒼先生後人處。惟不知雨蒼先生得自何許？予另爲長文加以考釋，茲漫書數語，以識眼福。</p>
<h3>記譚元博殉難赤柱</h3>
<p>— 陸丹林</p>
<p>南海譚元博（名長黃，玉生曾孫，叔裕孫，栘盒子，爲黎季裴之婿），在香港聖士提反中學校，任敎席殆二十年，敦品勵行，爲衆所信仰。民三十年冬，日軍攻香港，在赤柱登陸時，譚留守校中，不肯他避，曰：「護校，護諸生，吾責也。　衆再敦迫，則遺母及妻他往。及日軍人校，登樓强索諸生，君與辯，日軍怒，攢刺之死。越　，所傭老婦及校役　葬之校外荒郊。民卅一年春，李勁奄導往憑弔，蔓草荒烟，無碑無碣，僅挿柴　標誌，聊記識別耳。其當日與日軍爭者爲何語，以其時無人在側，莫能明也。或云：日軍欲犯一女敎員，君怒駡之，因被殺·事平後，學校乃公葬諸校園，並立碑紀念，其文爲葉遐菴（恭綽）所作，文曰：「維一九四一年十二月，日本攻香港，廿四日陷赤柱，翌日侵入本校。時譚君方留守，被執不屈死。先是敵將至，校長勸君走避，君送母　他往，身矢守校，以護諸生，遂及於難。鳴呼，開校以來，敎職員有勞於校者至衆，若以身殉職，君一人而已。君名長萱，字元博，廣東南海人，家世積學，爲時之望。君畢業本校，入香港大學，授文學士，任本校敎授及漢文主任，垂二十年，同僚挹服，往衆　不敬愛。遺妻黎墨。君無子女。本校敬君平日志行，及守死善道，一時無兩，謹勸石校壁，永垂光烈，且爲羣範。一九四七年聖士提反中學敬立，番禺葉恭綽撰書。」</p>
<p>聞遐菴與其家世交，譚字元博，乃遐菴所定，望其爲季元禮范孟博也。遐菴於譚之死難，有詩紀事云：「赤柱山頭碧血凉，　歌守死意何長。孤行終遣維人紀，一瞑誰知是國殤。抉目忍看餘　魎，亡身寗道不綱常。望夫石老天涯遠，悵憶前塵月滿廊。」譚殉難後，母思其子死，父繼死，僅妻存，俊遂絕，天道難知，亦云酷矣。當其公葬也，爲繪海山埋碧圖，將爲廣徵題詠，用志感悼。余意抗日八年，同胞喪命，殆及千萬，若寄居域外，以死勤事如譚者，實不多覯，故特志之。</p>
<h3>記景寗</h3>
<p>— 翼雲</p>
<p>景寗是浙江最偏僻的苦縣，地接閩境（與閩之壽寗縣比鄰），舊隸處州府屬，處州爲全浙最苦的地方，景寗又是處州最苦的縣，問之杭州人，多不知景寗在何處，可見其偏僻之極了。</p>
<p>「魚龍鷄鳳菜靈芝」，是昔人詠景寗的詩句，因爲河窄水淺，一淸見底，根本無數寸的魚，可供盤飧，故魚的難得，與龍相等；鷄是有的，但亦不多，其形特殊，兩足高大，身則瘦小，以充庖饌，只有皮筋與骨，肉則絕少，由於地疥糧缺，虫類亦少，故令消瘦如此，但土人則視爲珍品，不輕出售，欲求稍肥之鷄，眞如鳳毛麟角，絕不可得，至蔬菜因山地缺水，生長不易，在他處本爲易得之物，在景寗則甚難求，等於靈芝。土人所食多蕃薯等物，所產食米，其外層色甚鮮紅，煮成爲飯，其紅如血，望之可怕，即將外層　盡，米色亦極晦暗，雖較可食，在土人則視爲暴珍大物，罪過非小。全城無米肆，買米須向有田的富戶商購，但城中最大的田主，每年不過收穀　餘　，可見其　之少。豬肉亦無買處，偶宰一豬，必到處嗚鑼，人聞　聲，方可買肉，過此即無。</p>
<p>其地有一種特殊民族，名日　民，男子多蟄居山中，少與人接，女子有爲土人傭耕種之役者，在裙密薛下嚴，內不著褲，耳緊銀色之環，大可四寸，髮插銀色之簪，長達尺餘，體甚健碩，操勞勝於常人。</p>
<p>景寗土產，以看菰爲最，每歲冬初，種菰之客，租定山地，並盡購地上樹木，伐木去枝，斧劈樹榦，執斧者須種菰老手，否則斧劈深淺，未能適度，即不生菰。榦經劈後，置於地上，將所有枝葉，覆蓋其上，更以木爲蘭，　其外圍。若是歲冬雪甚大，則來年產菰必豐，否則歉收。菰皆生於樹榦斧劈處，第一年所收有限，次年則豐，又次年最豐，嗣後即逐漸减少，種者亦棄而他圖。種菰之客，爲景寗最大商人。此外亦產茶葉，色碧如龍井，但葉薄少味，亦由地瘠所致也。抗戰時，浙省機關及人民多過麗水龍泉一帶，毗連的景寗，亦見繁榮，想今日當較昔進步不少。</p>
<p>###</p>
<p>昔之御史彈劾大員奏摺，有時讀駡　詆（如甲午年安維峻之劾李鴻章）然只紙上熱鬧，並非當面斥辱，使人「唾面白乾」也。然而民初之兩院議員則當面斥責行政官！彼時之議院於立法之外，兼有彈劾，提請查辦，請行政官出席受質問之種種特權。吾在民初十餘年間，常任時報駐北京記者，歷屆國會，皆赴樓上記者席旁聽，目睹形形色色。行政官被請到院上台之後，台下之質問者輙盛氣相向，有時雜以輕謔，行所無事，視若當然。一次，有位大員被幾位議員指責得難受已極，將下台時，憤憤然說出兩句話：（一）是：「靑備則可，不應該侮辱。」（二）是：「本人當初亦是台下在座的一人。」語畢，飄然而退。合下（議員席）樓上（旁聽席）皆愕然。此公兩句話，實是要言不煩，足資警醒。</p>
<p>原來這位大員在兩年前亦是議員，後因政治的才望與活動，取得行政之高位，此次到院，便做了台上人（行政官出席議院有專席在台上兩側）。昔以台下對台上，爲「彈人者」，今日居台上，又爲「被彈者」，故其自道日：「本人亦曾居議席。」意思就是警告當時合下人，除非一世爲議員，否則一旦自登政府，亦要親嘗滋味，易地皆然，早晚一樣。此時爲他人留下餘地，即爲將來的自己留些餘地。</p>
<p>吾輩記者在旁聽席，則是「旁觀者淸」了。對於循環式的「當局者迷」，只覺其可嘆，與國家的政治，是非得失，試問有何關係？只可學佛家言，作傷曰：「欲知前世因，今生受者是。欲知今世因，來生受者是。善哉呀，善哉！」</p>

        <h1>1948.06.25</h1>
<h3>Gu Zhutong and Zhang Zhizhong Summoned to Fly to Xi'an, Shaanxi for Military Conference; Large-Scale Annihilation War Brewing in Yellow River Flood Area</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 24th] Reliable sources say that President Chiang Kai-shek convened an important military conference in Xi'an to discuss the Central Plains war situation and bandit suppression strategies. Chief of Staff Gu Zhutong, Commander-in-Chief of the Combined Service Forces Guo Chan, Director of the First Department of the Ministry of National Defense Hou Teng, Director of the Political Warfare Bureau Deng Wenyi, and their entourage, were summoned by the President via telegram and flew from Nanjing to Xi'an on a special plane at 9:00 AM on the 24th to attend the conference.</p>
<p>[Our Lanzhou Dispatch on the 24th] It is reported that the President convened a military conference of senior Northwest generals in Xi'an. Zhang Zhizhong, Director of the local Headquarters, Vice Director and Qinghai Chairman Ma Bufang, and 81st Division Commander Ma Hongbin, etc., all flew to Shaanxi on a special plane at 8:00 AM on the morning of the 4th.</p>
<p>[Our Xi'an Dispatch on the 24th] Zhang Zhizhong, together with Ma Hongbin and others, flew from Lanzhou to Xi'an this afternoon. Furthermore, Guo Chan, Hou Teng, Deng Wenyi, and their entourage also arrived in Xi'an this afternoon on a special plane from Nanjing.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 24th] A major battle is brewing in the Yellow River flood area in eastern Henan. The majority of Chen Yi's bandit troops have fled south across the Longhai Railway from western Shandong, to the area south of Neihuang and Lankao, and the area between Qi County and Fugou. Some of Chen's bandits who attacked Kaifeng have also fled south to the vicinity of Weishi. Those who were between Zhongmou and Xiangsha have fled to the area of Xinzheng and Mi County. It appears that all have been concentrated on the great plains of eastern Henan. The National Army is pressing the bandits from Minquan, Queshan, Zhumadian, Zhengzhou, and western Shandong, and is attacking Qi County with strong forces in order to defeat the main force of the bandits in this vast area.</p>
<p>[Our Xuzhou Dispatch on the 24th] The Yellow Sea Air Force squadron flew on the 24th to widely search the Qi County and Chenliu highway southeast of Bian, and the area between Tongxu and Zhuxian Town. The handcarts and scattered vehicles of the bandit's 33rd and 55th units were the main bombing targets. Also, a large part of the supplies looted from Kaifeng by the bandits was transported to the north bank of the Yellow River, and a portion was transported south to eastern Henan.</p>
<p>[Our Xi'an Dispatch on the 24th] The majority of the bandits in western Henan fled east, returning to the Pinghan Railway. Liu Bocheng's First and Second Columns, and Chen Geng's Fourth and Ninth Columns, have fled to Xiejiadian and Xindian west of Wuyang, and the advance troops have crossed Wuyang. In addition, a strong National Army contingent in northern Shaanxi captured Baishui County in one fell swoop at 7:00 AM on the 24th.</p>
<h3>Legislative Yuan Reviews War Situation; He Yingqin Points Out Reasons for Kaifeng's Fall and Declares Zhengzhou Can Absolutely Be Secured</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 24th] The Legislative Yuan held a special session all day on the 24th to review the Central Plains war situation. The session began at 9:00 AM, presided over by President Sun Ke. Minister of National Defense He Yingqin, accompanied by Vice Minister Xiao Yisu, attended upon invitation. After announcing the start of the meeting, He Yingqin gave a one-hour report. He first explained that the Organic Law of the Ministry of National Defense was being revised, and that the principles guiding current military operations had already been reported by President Weng in response to inquiries about administrative policies. He reiterated that the Minister of National Defense was responsible for military administration, while military orders were directed by the Chief of Staff, who acted upon the President's orders. The Chief of Staff was the chief of staff to the commander-in-chief and the administrative officer of the Minister of National Defense. In peacetime, military administration was more important than military orders, while in wartime, military administration supported military orders. He also stated that Chief of Staff Gu Zhutong was unable to attend because he was summoned by the President to fly to Xi'an at 9:00 AM that morning, and therefore the military order component could not be explained in detail. Secondly, He Yingqin analyzed the rapid expansion of the communist forces' power after the victory. Their troop strength and light weapons were now comparable to the National Army, but they were still no match for the National Army in terms of heavy weapons, naval, and air forces. As for the Kaifeng campaign, the fundamental reasons for the defeat and the fall of the important town were the failure of intelligence work and the misjudgment of the enemy situation. However, he emphasized that the temporary loss of Kaifeng could not be regarded as a complete failure of the Central Plains war. He read aloud the telegrams from generals Liu Zhi, Liu Ruming, and other commanders currently directing operations in the Central Plains battlefield, proving that the National Army was actively launching a campaign to annihilate the bandit forces in order to reverse the Central Plains war situation and recover Kaifeng. Finally, he repeatedly declared that there was absolutely no problem in ensuring the security of Zhengzhou. After He Yingqin's report, many committee members from Henan and North China provinces spoke in succession, vehemently criticizing the various responsibility issues related to the loss of Kaifeng. Most of their opinions focused on the following points: (1) The bandit suppression military strategy was inappropriate. The National Army was defending its territory and being passively attacked, while the bandit army aimed to destroy the National Army's combat power and was maneuvering everywhere. Countermeasures should be sought in the future; (2) Command was overstepped, responsibility was unclear, and deployment was unconstitutional, which must be corrected; (3) Rewards and punishments were unfair, and soldiers did not risk their lives. Factional prejudices should be eliminated in the future; (4) Military discipline was deteriorating, and local forces were not fully coordinated or utilized. Serious rectification should be carried out in the future, and attention should be paid to the effective assistance of local forces. Some committee members were heartbroken by the phenomenon that important strongholds and stockpiled military supplies were not utilized and were abandoned to the enemy. Some committee members criticized the Air Force for neglecting the lives of our military and civilians, and that bombing the walls of Kaifeng during the mixed battle was inappropriate. The majority of committee members demanded that derelict combat intelligence personnel be severely punished. A total of fifty to sixty committee members spoke throughout the day. He Yingqin responded to the inquiries of the committee members in the afternoon and expressed his sincere acceptance of the constructive opinions of the committee members. However, due to the difficulty in clarifying the responsibility issues, most committee members were not satisfied. The meeting adjourned at 6:00 PM.</p>
<h3>He Yingqin Scheduled to Fly to Beiping Today</h3>
<p>[Our Beiping Dispatch on the 24th] He Yingqin is scheduled to fly to Beiping on the 25th to inspect. Northern generals will also gather in their hometown. Also, Zhang Qun and his wife visited the Summer Palace this afternoon. It is rumored that General Zhang Zuoyi held a dinner party in the garden to welcome them, and they did not return until 9:00 PM. Also, Zhang Fakui returned to Beiping from Tianjin at 6:30 PM this afternoon and will transfer to Nanjing within days.</p>
<h3>Henan People in Nanjing to Petition Today for Handling Kaifeng Relief and Rehabilitation; Report of Liu Maoen's Death Unconfirmed</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 24th] After the situation in Kaifeng became unclear, the serious deaths of our military, civilian, public education personnel, and students have been widely reported here. Henan people in Nanjing, legislative and supervisory committee members, and National Assembly representatives have been extremely indignant and saddened in recent days. On the 24th, they gathered at the Central Hotel at 9:00 AM and 9:00 PM to discuss relief for refugees and students and to commemorate the compatriots who died in the disaster. Most of those who attended in the morning were National Assembly representatives and provincial senators. At the evening meeting, more than one hundred Henan legislative and supervisory committee members, National Assembly representatives, provincial senators, and people in Nanjing participated. Zhang Fang, a respected elder from Henan Province, also came to Nanjing from Jiangxi via Shanghai on the 24th to jointly plan for the aftermath. Zhang Fang presided over the evening meeting. More than ten people, including Guo Zhongwei, Li Hongyi, and Zhou Yanguang, spoke one after another and decided to petition President Weng at 3:00 PM on the 25th, requesting the Executive Yuan to allocate 500 billion yuan to relieve the students and refugees who escaped from Kaifeng, and to send senior officials to Zhengzhou and Xuzhou to handle relief. Representatives of the Henan legislative and supervisory committee members and National Assembly representatives were elected to participate. In addition, it was decided at the meeting to remotely commemorate the military and civilians who died in Kaifeng at Kunlu Temple at 9:00 AM on the 27th.</p>
<p>[Our Zhengzhou Dispatch on the 24th] Reports of the deaths of Henan Chairman Liu Maoen and Finance Director Meng Zhaozan have not been confirmed. However, it has been confirmed that Provincial Government Secretary-General Ma Lingfu and Education Director Wang Gongdu have been captured. Provincial Party Headquarters Chairman Yan Huatang, Construction Director Song Tong, and Provincial Training Corps Education Director Ren Dasheng have escaped to Zhengzhou. The walls of Kaifeng are still in a state of chaos. Student and civilian deaths are severe, and official and civilian materials have been looted. There are only a few communist bandits in the city.</p>
<p>[Our Xuzhou Dispatch on the 24th] The stationmaster of Kaifeng Station, railway employees, and more than 1,500 Kaifeng public education personnel arrived in Xuzhou by train from Shangqiu on the 24th.</p>
<h3>Liu Maoen Possibly Committed Suicide by Self-Immolation</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 24th] Henan Legislative Committee member Duan Jianmin said on the 24th that, according to information he had received, regarding the report of Liu Maoen's death, Liu's special agent police chief had sent a telegram to the Henan Provincial Government's Beijing Office reporting that the situation in Kaifeng was critical on the 19th. Liu had invited his wife and brother Zhenhua to live in the Provincial Government, saying that if necessary, they would die together. On the 21st, the bandits set fire to the Provincial Government everywhere. Liu invited his subordinates and advised them to escape quickly, but he himself decided to die for the trust the leader had placed in him and would not leave the Provincial Government. His subordinates advised him to leave, but Liu refused. When the special agent battalion commander and others left on the 22nd, they saw the Provincial Government on fire. Chairman Liu was thought to have committed suicide by self-immolation at that time, and his brother Zhenhua was also inside. However, Duan stated that this news has not been officially confirmed.</p>
<h3>National Banks Adopt Differential Interest Rate Principles While Maintaining Low-Interest Policy</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 24th] The issue of interest rates on loans from national banks was discussed at the board meeting of the Four Banks Joint Administration on the 24th. It was generally believed that it was necessary to increase interest rates, but the impact on stimulating commodity prices after the interest rate increase should also be taken into consideration. Finally, it was decided that the principle of maintaining a low-interest policy should be maintained, and differential interest rates should be adopted. Those that truly needed to be increased should be increased appropriately.</p>
<p>[Another Dispatch] The Four Banks Joint Administration held its 366th board meeting on the morning of the 24th, presided over by Weng Wenhao. It approved the handling methods for loan and finished product purchase cases, and the calculation methods for deposit interest rates from December 9, 1941, to Victory Day.</p>
<h3>Fierce Battles on the Outskirts of Qinhuangdao; Beidaihe and Beicang Station Lost and Regained; National Army Meets at Gubeikou</h3>
<p>[Our Qinhuangdao Dispatch on the 24th] Qinhuangdao suddenly became tense on the night of the 23rd. From 2:00 AM on the 24th, the sound of artillery in the city gradually intensified, shaking the roofs. From 9:00 AM, the navy fired artillery to assist in the battle, resounding throughout the city. However, the city was peaceful. The bandits concentrated between Qian'an and Funing moved near the railway two days ago. From midnight on the 23rd, they launched a full-scale attack. The fighting west of Qinhuangdao did not stop on the 24th. The main battlefield was in Beidaihe, where the provincial defense battalion was surrounded by five or six regiments of bandits. The National Army put up a strong resistance, and the fighting was fierce. In addition, the bandits' Eleventh Column, attached to a cavalry brigade, besieged Changli. Another two columns of bandits (possibly the Eighth and Twelfth Columns) continued to arrive, and a major battle may take place. It is now difficult to contact Changli from here. Fan Hanjie happened to come to Qinhuangdao to take command. The National Army east of Shanhaiguan and Tangshan has taken a pincer attack posture to encircle the attacking bandits. Qinhuangdao is safe. In addition, a repair train has been dispatched to rescue the armored trains blocked between the stations.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Shenyang Dispatch on the 24th] Military news: The fighting on the outskirts of Qinhuangdao has broken out again. More than 10,000 bandits launched an attack on Yantongshan, Qiyun Temple, and Beidaihe Station at dawn on the 24th, and engaged in fierce fighting with the defending troops in those areas. Beidaihe Station was once captured by the bandits but was bravely retaken by our army. Both sides are still fighting fiercely.</p>
<p>[Our Beiping Dispatch on the 24th] The Rehe bandits crossed the Great Wall line and entered eastern Hebei. The Tangyu section of the Beining Railway was disrupted on the morning of the 24th. Changli, Anshan, Shimen, and the Luanhe Railway Bridge were all attacked on the 23rd, and the fighting was extremely fierce. As of 4:00 PM on the 24th, the situation in Shimen and Anshan was unclear. Changli was engaged in fierce fighting in the northeastern suburbs.</p>
<p>[Our Tianjin Dispatch on the 24th] Beicang Station, between Beiping and Tianjin on the Beining Railway, was captured by the bandits on the morning of the 24th. The offices inside the station were burned down, and the deputy stationmaster Song Zhigong and several workers were captured. After the National Army rushed to rescue them, the bandits retreated after a fierce battle until dawn. A total of fourteen sections of the road between Nancang, Beicang, and Yangcun were destroyed and were repaired and opened to traffic that day.</p>
<p>[Our Beiping Dispatch on the 24th] The National Army inside and outside Gubeikou met yesterday evening. The bandits were divided and retreated to the northwest and northeast. The Bandit Suppression Headquarters announced that the battle resulted in the capture of 1,352 various types of firearms, 2,753 bandit corpses abandoned, and 342 bandits captured, making it another major victory after the Tangshan outer defense battle.</p>
<p>[Our Beiping Dispatch on the 24th] The section of the Ping-Sui Railway between Pingzhang and Tumu, Langshan, Shacheng, Xinbao'an, and Xiahuayuan was destroyed last night.</p>
<h3>Bandits Near Zaoshi in Central Hubei Have Been Defeated</h3>
<p>[Our Hankou Dispatch on the 24th] The bandits who disrupted the area near Zaoshi in Central Hubei were defeated on the evening of the 23rd.</p>
<h3>Fierce Fighting Resumes in Western Section of Jiaoji Railway</h3>
<p>National Army in Zhangqiu Longshan Transfers</p>
<p>[Our Jinan Dispatch on the 24th] Fierce fighting has resumed on the outskirts of Longshan in the west of the Jiaoji Railway. The remnants of the New Seventh and Eleventh Divisions of the Bohai Column of bandits regrouped with the Twenty-fifth, Twenty-sixth, and Twenty-seventh Divisions of the Ninth Column on the night of the 23rd and launched a fierce attack on Zhangqiu and Longshan in several routes. One group even infiltrated Baitazhuang and Shanhoushai southeast of Longshan. In order to adopt an absolute mobile warfare tactic and select favorable terrain to annihilate them, the National Army automatically transferred its main force to the vicinity of Guodian at noon on the 24th. Also, the fighting in the Taishan area was still fierce south of Wande on the 24th.</p>
<p>[Our Xuzhou Dispatch on the 24th] The situation on the outskirts of Yanzhou has stabilized. The two sides are now separated by the Si River to the southeast of the city, and there is only minor contact to the northwest of the city. Also, the National Army, which captured Wande, continued to advance to Jiemu on the 24th.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Yantai Dispatch on the 24th] The National Army in Yantai Fushan wiped out the remaining bandits and advanced eastward, crossing San Shi Li Pu and recovering Zoujiafangjia (45 li southeast of Yantai). The Fushan National Army captured strongholds such as Woniu Mountain and Huanghualing (15 li south of Fushan).</p>
<h3>Large Amounts of Capital Fleeing to Hong Kong, Confirmed by Commissioners of the Four Banks Joint Administration; Startling Increase in Bank Deposits After the War</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 24th] The large-scale flight of domestic capital to Hong Kong has now been confirmed. Xu Changcheng, the commissioner of the Four Banks Joint Administration stationed in Hong Kong, recently submitted an investigation report on the large-scale flight of capital to the Four Banks Joint Administration, which listed several figures obtained from the investigation. It is reported that the biggest proof of capital flight to Hong Kong is the sharp increase in bank deposit accounts and deposit figures after the war. According to bank personnel, before the war, there were only one or two depositors with deposits of more than 10 million yuan, more than ten with more than 5 million yuan, and very few with more than 1 million yuan. After the war, there were more than 1,000 new depositors with deposits of more than 10 million yuan, nearly 10,000 with more than 5 million yuan, and countless with more than 1 million yuan. This is just the deposit situation of one foreign bank in Hong Kong, and the numbers are startling. The amount deposited in other banks and used for investment in real estate and stocks is even greater. The Hong Kong government issued a total of 300 million new Hong Kong dollars without reserve funds after the war. However, it is generally estimated that only 50 million Hong Kong dollars is needed for circulation in the Hong Kong market. The rest is in the hands of Chinese people for investment or to absorb materials. In terms of investment, someone recently purchased land and built a factory in To Kwa Wan, Kowloon, for several million Hong Kong dollars, which was several times more than the reserve price. Another wealthy businessman from Shanghai purchased land in Kowloon for 740,000 Hong Kong dollars. There are also many people engaged in remittance operations. All of these points confirm that domestic capital has indeed fled to Hong Kong in large quantities after the war.</p>
<h3>Deng Xihou Arrives in Chengdu</h3>
<p>Scheduled to Take Office in Hanzhong at the End of the Month</p>
<p>[Our Chengdu Dispatch on the 24th] Deng Xihou flew back to Chengdu from Chongqing this afternoon, and was warmly welcomed by people from all walks of life. It is said that he intended to retire after leaving Sichuan for three months, but the President and the central government repeatedly urged him to uphold righteousness. Therefore, he decided to reluctantly take on the difficult task.

<h3>Control Yuan Exercises Confirmation Power; All Four Presidential Nominees for Presidents and Vice Presidents of the Judicial and Examination Yuans Pass with Majority Vote</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing Dispatch on the 24th] President Chiang Kai-shek issued the following orders on the 24th: (1) Appointing Wang Chonghui as President of the Judicial Yuan; (2) Appointing Shi Zhiquan as Vice President of the Judicial Yuan; (3) Appointing Zhang Boling as President of the Examination Yuan; (4) Appointing Jia Jingde as Vice President of the Examination Yuan.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 24th] The first Control Yuan under the Constitution exercised its power of confirmation for the first time on the 24th in accordance with the Constitution. It held a vote by secret ballot on the President's nominations of Wang Chonghui as President of the Judicial Yuan, Shi Zhiquan as Vice President, Zhang Boling as President of the Examination Yuan, and Jia Jingde as Vice President, requesting the Control Yuan's consent. As a result, all four nominees passed with a majority of affirmative votes and were reported to the President.</p>
<p>Ninth Meeting</p>
<p>The President's nomination message was delivered to the Control Yuan on the 23rd. The Control Yuan held its ninth meeting at 9:30 AM on the 24th to announce it. After the secretariat read the President's message, Committee Member Tao Baichuan made a temporary motion, stating that the plenary review meeting of the Control Yuan to exercise its power of confirmation was not a matter of military, national defense, or diplomatic state secrets, and there was no need for secrecy. News reporters should be allowed to attend and observe. Tao explained that this was about people, not about things, and there was no secrecy. He also said that if the reporters were kept outside, the so-called secrecy would only be an act of self-deception. Yang Lingde was the first to stand up and express his agreement. However, Gu Fengxiang, Liang Shangdong, Liu Xingzhi, and others expressed their opposition, believing that they could not contradict themselves and overturn the regulations they had set. They should not be submitted for a vote or discussion. The chairman then declared that it would be handed over to the plenary review committee for handling. The meeting adjourned at 10:00 AM, and Huang Jue was appointed as the chairman of the plenary review committee, which then convened.</p>
<p>Plenary Review Committee</p>
<p>At the beginning of the review committee meeting, the chairman first raised the issue of a closed meeting. It was unanimously argued that the motion could not be established and should not be submitted for discussion. The chairman announced that, in accordance with Article 2 of the Regulations on the Exercise of the Power of Confirmation, the plenary review committee would be chaired by one committee member, and the meeting would be held in secret. All persons other than committee members were asked to leave.</p>
<p>During the discussion, most committee members believed that the content of the President's message was too simple and did not include resumes and credentials as stipulated in the Regulations on the Exercise of the Power of Confirmation drafted by the Control Yuan. Some committee members believed that it was not necessary to send resumes because the Regulations on the Exercise of the Power of Confirmation had not been sent to the President for review, and the President was not aware of this additional condition. Moreover, Wang Chonghui and Zhang Boling, who were nominated this time, were not only accomplished scholars in China but also enjoyed international renown. This condition should not be raised. If such harsh conditions were to be imposed, it would be tantamount to making virtuous people unwilling to serve, because they were nominated and not volunteering. Another group of committee members believed that the President's message did not include resumes and credentials, which was a violation of the law. The dispute lasted for several hours, and the meeting adjourned without a result at noon.</p>
<p>Voting Results</p>
<p>In the afternoon, President Yu Youren informed the President's Office of this matter. The President's Office then rushed to prepare documents and sent a copy of the resumes of the four nominees to the Control Yuan. The Control Yuan continued to hold a plenary review committee in the afternoon, briefly reviewed the resumes, and then declared it complete. After a break, the plenary session was reconvened to conduct the voting. The voting was very quick that day. There were 146 committee members present, 146 ballots issued, and 146 votes cast. (1) Wang Chonghui received 132 affirmative votes, 12 negative votes, and 2 invalid votes. (2) Shi Zhiquan received 123 affirmative votes, 18 negative votes, and 5 invalid votes. (3) Zhang Boling received 127 affirmative votes, 16 negative votes, and 3 invalid votes. (4) Jia Jingde received 104 affirmative votes, 36 negative votes, and 6 invalid votes. Yu Youren announced the results at 6:30 PM, and all committee members applauded enthusiastically.</p>

<h3>Ambassador Wellington Koo Visits Yermol Regarding Military Aid to China's Tiger Gate Procedures; Gilbert Appointed Deputy Director of Aid to China</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 23rd] Our Ambassador to the United States, Wellington Koo, met with Assistant Secretary of State Yermol on the 23rd to discuss the procedures for $125 million in military aid to China. They also discussed the bilateral agreement for $275 million in economic aid to China and other matters. Koo stated that negotiations on the bilateral agreement are currently being held in Nanjing.</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 24th] Officials from the War Department and the State Department stated that the current military aid to China program operates as follows: The Chinese government submits requests for military supplies to the U.S. government, accompanied by documents indicating that the aid will be used effectively and managed by the Chinese army. The War Department and the State Department then review China's request and authorize the Chinese government to obtain the funds. The review includes general and rough oversight of the funds, but does not involve social oversight of the military aspects of the aid to China program.</p>
<p>[City News] Lapham announced yesterday the appointment of Gilbert, the head of the China Relief Mission, as Deputy Director of Aid to China. Lapham emphasized that while the official headquarters of the Economic Cooperation Administration will be located in Nanjing, Shanghai will be its primary base of operations. It is expected that most of the Economic Cooperation Administration's personnel will be stationed in Shanghai. Lapham stated, "I will spend much of my time in locations outside of Shanghai, not only going to Nanjing but also visiting other parts of China. I must have sufficient freedom to handle the overall objectives of the delegation, and therefore, I hope that Mr. Gilbert can shoulder and manage all the activities of the Economic Cooperation Administration in China."</p>
<p>Lapham continued, "The Congressional reduction of the Economic Cooperation Administration's funds makes it even more difficult for us to decide how to use the funds finally allocated by Congress to benefit China most effectively." He predicted that the $275 million aid allocation to China could be distributed by April 3, 1949.</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Reversing the Decline of the Central Plains Battlefield</h3>
<p>The Legislative Yuan held a temporary closed-door meeting yesterday morning to review the reasons for the defeat in the Central Plains and the responsibility for the fall of Kaifeng. The members spoke one after another, all with passion and righteous indignation, lamenting the critical situation of the Central Plains battlefield. Minister of National Defense General He Yingqin was also invited to attend, explained the decline of the Central Plains battlefield, and answered questions from the legislators. The future development of the Central Plains battlefield is indeed a concern for the entire nation. Minister He said that he is determined to do everything possible to win. We also hope so, because today's overall situation in China depends on the success or failure of the suppression of the bandits. The authorities responsible for military affairs are truly burdened with the safety and security of the world.</p>
<p>The gains and losses of the Central Plains battles not only concern the safety of Henan Province but also affect the entire war situation. The defending forces in Kaifeng, after six days and nights of bloody fighting, withdrew to the suburbs on the 22nd at noon to continue fighting the bandit army in the city. The fall of this famous city in the Central Plains to the bandits is now undeniable. As of this writing, the reinforcements heading towards Kaifeng, the Qiu Corps advancing from Lanfeng, have only reached ten miles from the outskirts of Kaifeng. The National Army advancing eastward from Zhengzhou is still fighting the bandit army in Zhongmou. The National Army heading north from Weishi has not yet crossed Zhuxian Town. The so-called National Army's three-pronged convergence on Kaifeng still seems to be some time away. The decline of the Central Plains battlefield has not improved. At this moment, we are only anxious and depressed, which does not help the overall situation. Rather than investigating the responsibility for the defeat in the Central Plains and the fall of Kaifeng, it is better for the responsible military authorities to be determined to ensure Zhengzhou and recover Kaifeng as soon as possible to reverse the decline of the Central Plains battlefield.</p>
<p>Henan is the central fortress in the Central Plains battlefield, especially the southwest of Henan Province, with its dangerous terrain, strong local customs, and the foundation of local armed forces. It is the central fortress of the central fortress. Therefore, from a geographical point of view, the fall of Kaifeng to the bandits not only means the fall of the entire Henan Province but also the area between the Yangtze River, Huai River, Xu River, and Si River will also feel its threat. Legislator Ma Chengfeng and others suggested that the Legislative Yuan review the reasons for the failure in the Central Plains and issued a long speech, loudly appealing and lamenting the importance of defending Kaifeng, and put forward a shocking slogan. He said: "If you can't protect the southwest of Henan, you can't protect Henan; if you can't protect Henan, you can't protect the Yangtze River!" We only need to look at the war situation in Henan to prove that their appeals are not purely alarmist. Look at Shanxi Province, most of which has been occupied by the bandit army for a long time. Look at southern Hebei, western Shandong, northern Hubei, and southern Shaanxi, which are almost all places where the bandit army appears. Therefore, once Kaifeng falls, Zhengzhou is isolated, and if it cannot be secured, and this section of the Jinpu Railway is completely under the control of the bandit army, then the communists, echoing each other from east to west, will form a single front and block the National Army north and south of Henan. If so, not only will the deterioration of the Central Plains battlefield reach an irreversible point, but the defense of Xuzhou, Xi'an, and Wuhan may also face increased difficulties. Therefore, we say that the Central Plains battlefield is a major key to the entire anti-communist military campaign, which is by no means an exaggeration.</p>
<p>At the beginning of this communist offensive against Kaifeng, on one hand, they feigned a large-scale offensive in western Shandong, attracting a large number of National Army forces and leaving the defenses in southwestern Henan Province empty. On the other hand, they gathered more than 60,000 troops from the Chen and Liu bandit units and took the opportunity to attack the suburbs of Kaifeng. If the National Army's intelligence was accurate and its fighting spirit was strong, with some preparation beforehand and rapid reinforcements afterward, there is no reason why Kaifeng could not have been defended for a long time and the siege relieved. However, the National Army stationed in Kaifeng had only two regiments, plus the local security forces, which lacked complete weaponry. How can we blame them for not holding out for a long time with exhausted troops against ferocious and stubborn bandits? The communist bandits arrived ten miles outside Kaifeng on the 17th, and by the 19th, they had broken through the city's defenses and entered the urban area, entering the stage of street fighting. The defending forces fought valiantly to the death for six days and nights before withdrawing to the suburbs. The Chairman of Henan Province, Liu Mao-en, was also reported to have died in the line of duty, perishing with the city. It can be seen that the defending forces bear less responsibility for the fall of Kaifeng. If, during the Kaifeng defending forces' tenacious defense, the National Army in Zhengzhou, Nanyang, and Hanzhong could have quickly rushed to the rescue, arriving as ordered, then the siege of Kaifeng would not have been impossible to relieve. From this, we can see that the lack of unified military and political orders, and the decline of the morale of the reinforcements, cannot but be held responsible for the defeat in the Central Plains. In fact, the deterioration of the Central Plains battlefield began in September last year when the bandit army crossed the river from southwestern Henan Province, and became serious with the fall of Luoyang in March this year. However, the military authorities have never raised their vigilance on this matter, leaving only two regiments of the National Army to defend Kaifeng, while the central government was busy convening meetings to reorganize the government and compete for positions and power, putting military and national affairs on the back burner, which led to the fall of the famous city in the Central Plains. At the same time, the military authorities failed to make full use of the local armed forces in Henan Province, which had a solid foundation. According to legislator Ma Chengfeng's report, it was as difficult as ascending to heaven for the local Henan teams to obtain weapons and ammunition from the central government. How can we expect these local troops with incomplete weaponry to defend the local area? These past mistakes and failures are worthy of deep reflection by the military authorities in the future. The past cannot be blamed, but the future can be pursued. We hope that the military authorities will thoroughly and decisively change their course!</p>
<p>Reviewing the military situation over the past year, the power of the communist bandits has been expanding day by day, and they have changed from guerrilla warfare to positional warfare, and from destroying transportation lines to capturing large strongholds. The communist bandits' capture of Luoyang in March this year and their recent capture of Kaifeng are clear evidence. Looking back at the National Army, it has changed from active to passive. In the past, it could still defend lines and points, but now it seems unable to defend even important strongholds. Although the military authorities are advocating "total war," if we continue in this way, without changing the old habits, then the result of procrastination and perfunctoriness will make it very difficult to reverse the military decline. The people of the country have great expectations for the newly appointed Minister of National Defense He Yingqin and Chief of Staff Gu Zhutong, but whether they can reverse the current military decline will depend on whether the National Army can converge on Kaifeng, boost morale, and recover Kaifeng.</p>
<p>Witnessing the daily increase in military decline, we have long felt distressed and indignant, but we have remained silent, unwilling to express our inner troubles, lest we increase the reader's anxiety about the overall situation. However, in today's critical situation in the Central Plains and in today's situation where every citizen is responsible for the rise and fall of the nation, we really cannot remain silent. In fact, today's military problems are not complicated. In short, one is the issue of unified command and changing strategy; the other is how to strictly enforce rewards and punishments so that officers and soldiers can share hardships together, in order to encourage the morale of the front line. Minister He has also mentioned this before, but unfortunately, there has not been time to implement it. We hope that Minister He can use great courage and perseverance to work quickly, practically, and diligently, so that his troop reorganization plan can be fully implemented. We also hope that the people of the country will support Minister He and Chief of Staff Gu in their joint goal of suppressing the rebellion and building the nation, strictly enforce military discipline, eliminate corruption, and enable the whole country to contribute its strength and money. If this can be done, then although the overall situation is dangerous, it will not be difficult to reverse the decline in morale and turn around the bad situation in the military!</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper Beiping, 24th] The Beijing Municipal Council questioned Police Chief Tang Yongxian today, and the questioning turned into a verbal brawl, nearly becoming a physical fight. After Tang reported on his administration on the afternoon of the 23rd, 13 people continued to question him on nine matters this morning. Among them, the strongest criticism was directed at the unsolved six-life murder case at Lu Zu Ge. Tang replied, first saying, "The meeting hall should emphasize order and not be contentious." The councilors were in an uproar. Tang said, "The councilors do not have three heads and six arms, so they should not be like this." This sentence ended the proceedings, and the council descended into chaos. The councilors rose up to pound the table, and some went forward to turn off the microphone on the podium, preventing Tang from speaking.

<p>[Our Newspaper Jinan, 24th] A tragedy and comedy of marriage changes has recently occurred here. Zhao Geng, a resident of No. 35 Bianjia Village, Beiyuan, is a vegetable seller. His eldest daughter, Yumei, 19 years old, was betrothed to Wang Gouzi of Huangjiatun. The official wedding ceremony was scheduled for the 22nd. However, this Yumei was naturally flirtatious and fell in love with a certain soldier at first sight, carrying out a lightning-style union.

<h3>Japan Promotes New Land Reform Plan</h3>
<p>— Wu Jiatang</p>
<p>Japan's land reform plan is being steadily advanced under the auspices of the Allied Headquarters. Its successful and effective implementation is worthy of emulation by our countrymen. The purpose of the reform plan is to eliminate the economic cruelty of the tenancy system. The process of implementation has been quite smooth, without unrest, and with very few economic disruptions.</p>
<p>The basic occupation policy of the Allied Headquarters is to prevent Japan from trending towards communism. Therefore, land reform has become a central policy. One thing that is difficult to understand is that land reform is usually the most important part of the Communist Party's plan. However, the Japanese Communist Party strongly opposes the land reform plan. They accuse it of maintaining the private land ownership system as a superficial reform of changing the soup but not the ingredients by the capitalists. The main purpose is not to seek happiness for the laborers, but to maintain capitalist exploitation.</p>
<p>In fact, the real reason for the Japanese Communist Party's opposition is that after the Allied Headquarters implemented this reform, they seized the trump card in their hands and destroyed the Communist Party's propaganda excuse. The success of the Allied Headquarters' plan has made Japanese farmers increasingly unwilling to accept the sweet talk of the Communist Party. I personally feel that China's land reform also urgently needs to be resolved. If a similar plan can be implemented immediately, it can break the Communist Party's "Wang Reform" propaganda offensive. However, I have little research on this issue and can only provide Japanese information for reference by relevant experts.</p>
<p>Of course, the extreme right-wing elements in Japan also strongly oppose the Allied Headquarters' reform plan. Before these people were dismantled in Japan, they were always supported by the large landowners. In those days, the large landowners were like small emperors in the countryside, oppressing tenant farmers and currying favor with the military. The political activities they led were full of stubborn reaction and militarism, with the aim of maintaining their vested interests and the status of the large landowners. On the other hand, at that time, the military also used tenant farmers as political capital, often using touching slogans to tell the tenant farmers that as long as they followed the military, they would eventually get their own land. Coupled with the sweet talk of the prosperity of the Great Japanese Empire after the victory, the Japanese farmers followed their aggressive policies for many years.</p>
<p>However, the implementation of the Allied Headquarters' plan has now deprived both the Communist Party and the extreme right-wing elements of their trump cards. The correctness of this policy direction and the sophistication of its implementation are worthy of special study. The total area of Japan is 142,310 square miles, of which 16 percent is arable, approximately 15,000,000 acres. Forty percent of the total population, roughly six million families, derive their income wholly or partially from cultivation. Each family averages two and a half acres of land, but due to excessive cultivation, the land has become less fertile. Most farmers are unable to maintain a family livelihood. Before the war, about 70 percent of the farmers were tenant farmers. In the contracts between tenants and landlords, it was generally stipulated that half of the actual harvest be paid as rent. At the same time, the tenants had to pay for fertilizers, equipment, and rent. The actual income of the tenants was only a quarter of the harvest. It was very difficult to maintain the family's warmth and food in a good year. If there were natural disasters, there was no guarantee of livelihood. The first thing the Allied Headquarters did in governing Japan was to reform land ownership. On December 9, 1945, the Allied Headquarters issued a directive to the Japanese government, asking it to take the necessary measures to allow farmers to obtain a fairer distribution of their products. The purpose of this reform plan is moderate and practical, similar to the Father of the Nation's advocacy of "land to the tiller." The Japanese land reform plan was finally passed in the National Assembly on October 21, 1946. This plan has two main objectives: (1) to transfer land ownership to the farmers who actually cultivate it; (2) to improve the tenancy system. This plan emphasizes private land ownership, rather than state ownership and collective farming.</p>
<p>I feel that determining land ownership is very meaningful because after this, the Allied Headquarters created a group of small owner-farmers who, although having little land, could freely operate it with their labor. It can also be said that every farm family with one or two acres of land is an entrepreneur and capitalist. In this way, this group of small capitalists has become the broadest and most solid foundation of capitalist society. In a country heading towards communism, this is truly the best medicine. I feel that the theory and implementation steps of this policy itself are especially worthy of emulation by our countrymen. The goal of the land reform plan is to enable four-fifths of the tenant farmers in Japan to cultivate their own land. At the beginning of the implementation, the government first purchased land from the landlords at a price of 750 yen per tan (approximately ten acres), and paid the price with 24-year public bonds. The annual interest rate of the public price is two-thirds of a percent. The government buys land and sells it to tenant farmers at the same price. Payment can be made in a lump sum or in installments. The latter is paid in 30 years, and the annual interest rate is two-thirds of a percent. The law stipulates that the government has the right to purchase the following types of land: (1) Land owned by "absentee landlords" (i.e., what the Japanese call "non-resident landlords"); (2) Rented land that exceeds a certain retention standard; (3) Land of owner-farmers that exceeds the retention limit, unless they and their families can reasonably develop it; (4) Land owned by companies that is not directly related to the company's main business; (5) Land that can be used for agricultural development. In addition, the reform plan stipulates that tenant farmers who cultivated the land locally before November 23, 1945, have the highest priority to purchase the land.</p>
<p>In order to promote this reform plan, a farmland committee was established in each village. The members are all elected from the farmers. The ratio of the number of tenant farmers, owner-farmers, and landlords is 5:2:3. Each category freely elects its representatives to participate in the meeting. Each prefectural committee guides and supervises the work of the county committee, and the prefectural committee itself is guided by the Central Land Committee, which is chaired by the Minister of Agriculture and Forestry. I think that the smooth progress of the plan is due to the democratic implementation method. At the same time, the plan also stipulates that if farmers cannot fulfill their installment payments due to poor harvests or other legitimate reasons, the government cannot pledge their land. This method also does not allow tenant farmers to become large landlords, and the determination of the land limit standard is based on the arable nature of the land. The ordinary limit is seven and a half acres.</p>
<p>Under this plan, the tenant farmers who are currently cultivating 6.4 million acres will become owner-farmers cultivating 4.9 million acres. The complete eradication of the tenant system is considered unfeasible, but the tenancy system has been greatly improved. The law now stipulates: (1) There must be a written lease; (2) The highest rent for paddy fields is 25 percent of the harvest, and 15 percent for highlands; (3) The rent is paid in cash; (4) Changes and cancellations of the lease must be approved by the farmland committee.</p>
<p>Based on the information I have collected, although the land reform plan has not been implemented for long, it is progressing smoothly. The responsible personnel of the Allied Headquarters also told me that everything is being implemented according to the planned progress. The purchase of land has been implemented since March 31 last year. Within one year, the government has purchased a total of 3,980,000 acres of arable land, and 68,148 acres of land have been resold to farmers. In the process of implementing the plan, there have been incidents of fraud, but on the whole, the Japanese and the responsible personnel of the Allied Headquarters are satisfied with the smooth implementation of the plan. Of course, the large landowners are not happy with this plan, but they know that the Allied Headquarters fully supports this plan and can only accept it.</p>
<p>When I met with MacArthur, I mentioned this land issue. MacArthur pointed out that land reform is the basic policy of any occupying government. He also remembered that as early as the time of Roman Caesar, land reform was implemented on the occupied land. However, when a government's financial resources are insufficient to purchase land, it is very difficult to implement land policies. From his conversation, it is not difficult to see that among the various reforms carried out in Japan, land reform is what MacArthur hopes to perpetuate.</p>

<h3>US Republican Election Reaches Climax, National Convention Begins Voting, Dewey, Vandenberg and Six Others Nominated as Presidential Candidates, Dewey Camp Confident of Victory</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Philadelphia, 24th] After holding an all-night meeting yesterday, the Republican National Convention adjourned this morning at 4:00 AM (7:00 AM EST). It was decided that the first vote for presidential candidates would be held at 2:00 PM today (3:00 AM on the 25th, Shanghai time). The meeting last night was mostly taken up by speeches supporting the various candidates.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Philadelphia, 24th] The Republican Convention is scheduled to hold the first vote for presidential candidates elected by delegates from each state at 2:00 PM EST tonight (3:00 AM on Friday, Shanghai time). Supporters of Dewey claim that 500 votes can be obtained in the second election. Only 548 votes are required to secure the nomination. Victory is certain in the third election. Taft's supporters said that in the first election, Dewey's vote count would not exceed 400.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Philadelphia, 23rd] The Republican Convention has completed the nomination of presidential candidates and is about to begin voting. The candidates are New York Governor Dewey, Ohio Senator Taft, California Governor Warren, Former Minnesota Governor Stassen, Michigan Senator Vandenberg, and MacArthur of Wisconsin.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Philadelphia, 23rd] At today's Republican National Convention, after each state delegation gave its nomination speeches, they followed with pep rallies. This has always been the liveliest scene at American political conventions. For the past three days, the Republican delegates first quietly listened to the eloquent speeches of various important officials, and then passed a 2,000-word platform. Their enthusiasm was uncontainable. After the nominations, they gathered in groups, shouting wildly and supporting the candidates proposed by each state delegation. Various campaign groups in the hotels were actively campaigning. The Dewey camp and the anti-Dewey camp were engaged in fierce competition, unable to yield to each other. The Dewey camp's goal is to obtain enough votes in the first or second vote to win the presidential nomination. The anti-Dewey camp aims to prevent Dewey from achieving the above-mentioned blitzkrieg victory. The anti-Dewey camp wants to suppress Dewey's momentum at the last moment, while the Dewey camp is concentrating its efforts to strive for the top. Forty-seven of Pennsylvania's seventy-three delegates have publicly guaranteed their support for Dewey. Therefore, on the eve of the vote, Dewey seems to have gained an edge.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Philadelphia, 23rd] Senator Vandenberg indicated today that he agreed to be nominated as a presidential candidate. Vandenberg's action excited Taft, Stassen, and other candidates. They believe that Vandenberg's name will attract many votes that were originally intended for New York Governor Dewey. Before the first vote to elect the presidential candidate, Taft and Stassen's supporters made every effort but failed to make Dewey lose his leading position in the nomination competition. Taft and Stassen's supporters even held a meeting all day yesterday to form an alliance to stop Dewey. Taft and Stassen themselves also held several secret meetings yesterday and this morning. Although Stassen told reporters that Dewey could not obtain a majority of the nominations, several larger delegations have expressed their support for Dewey, such as the 33-member Missouri delegation and the 35-member New Jersey delegation.</p>

<p>[Reported by This Newspaper] London, 24th Broadcast: It is reported that the East German government is about to be established, and its provisional capital will most likely be located in Leipzig. One theory is that the Soviet Union intends to make Berlin the capital of East Germany.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Warsaw, 24th] An unconfirmed report says that Sokolovsky, Commander-in-Chief of the Soviet Forces in Germany, arrived here by special plane from Berlin on the afternoon of the 24th.</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 24th] The foreign ministers of the Soviet Union and its seven satellite countries repeated their discussion on the blueprint for the establishment of an East German state and a separate government on the 24th. The second meeting of the major Eastern European conference began at 10:00 AM. Strict security restrictions were enforced during the meeting, and all delegates were ordered to keep the meeting secret.</p>
<p>The official communique stated that the purpose of convening the meeting was to discuss the resolutions of the six-nation London Conference on the future of Germany. The six-nation Western European conference had drafted a plan for Germany, including the establishment of a government in the three Western occupation zones.</p>
<p>Authoritative sources said that the main task of the Warsaw Conference was to establish an East German government to counter the Western plan. Some observers believe that the new state of East Germany will be based in Leipzig, but there is no official confirmation. The "Warsaw Century" newspaper commented, "Due to the current international situation, especially the restoration of aggressive Germany, the necessity of holding this conference goes without saying. The meeting of the foreign and defense ministers of the eight communist countries, at the behest of Moscow, began on the 23rd, and Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov also participated."</p>
<p>[Reuters, Warsaw, 23rd] Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov and other political leaders from nine European countries and the Soviet occupation zone of Germany are now gathered at the Warsaw Conference to prepare to issue a joint declaration on Germany. The purpose of this meeting is to unify the Slavic countries to support the Soviet Union's proposal to establish an East German state. The main task of the Warsaw Conference will not begin until the 24th, but the chief representatives of the various countries have begun informal talks today. External sources in Poland said that the issue of Poland's western border will not be discussed at the meeting. Well-informed sources here said that before the Warsaw Conference, a meeting of the Communist Information Bureau was held in Prague starting last Saturday. The same sources also said that the Warsaw Conference initiated by the Soviet Union and Poland also invited French Foreign Minister Bidault to participate, but the Warsaw Conference's communique did not mention the participation of the leaders of the German, Italian, and French communist parties.</p>

<h3>Soviet Union Stops Electricity Supply, Blocks Berlin Traffic Lines, West Zone Food Reserves Only Enough for Three Days</h3>
<p>[Reported by This Newspaper] London, 24th Broadcast: Berlin News, the Soviet side announced the start of inspection of railway transport between Berlin and West Germany, the situation is already worse than expected, the food supply in the West Berlin area is threatened. Furthermore, Bevin reported back to work today, preparing to personally handle the tense situation in Germany.</p>
<p>[Reported by This Newspaper] London, 24th Broadcast: Britain stopped all transport to the Soviet occupation zone of Germany today. On the Soviet side, electricity supply to West Berlin was stopped.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Berlin, 24th] The Soviet authorities took the first retaliatory step against the Western Allies today, ordering the cutoff of electricity supply to the British, American, and French zones of Berlin, and blocking the only railway line between Berlin and the West German occupation zones, the "Berlin-Helmstedt" railway. The Soviet side claimed that due to "technical disturbances" on the railway line, they had to stop its traffic. As for the cessation of electricity supply, it was due to the lack of fuel for power generation in the Soviet zone.</p>
<p>Lao, chairman of the German Economic Commission in the Soviet zone, said that if Berlin does not receive air support, serious economic difficulties will occur in the West Berlin area. Eleven days ago, US Commander-in-Chief Clay said that he could transport food by plane to support Berlin as a "short-term emergency measure," so it would be very difficult to rely on air support for a long time.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Berlin, 24th] Herbert, the commander of the British forces in Berlin, issued a notice, instructing residents to be calm and not to panic, telling them that the food reserves are temporarily sufficient. Although the Soviet Union's cutoff of electricity supply to the West Berlin area will cause inconvenience, the West Berlin authorities are already trying to remedy it. (According to the BBC Berlin reporter, the food reserves in the British, American, and French zones of Berlin are only enough for three days. If the Soviet Union blocks railway freight for a long time, the food problem for the two million Germans in the West Berlin area will cause panic.)</p>

<p>[Reuters, Singapore, 24th] The Singapore government also promulgated an emergency ordinance today, granting the police emergency powers similar to the emergency powers of the Malayan Federal Police. After receiving the order, the Singapore police launched a search of the headquarters of the Communist Party Democratic Youth League. The police said that they only intended to search and arrest dangerous communist leaders and did not intend to arrest communists on a large scale.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Singapore, 24th] Five Indians and one Chinese were arrested when the headquarters of the New Democratic Youth League was searched.</p>
<h3>German Monetary Reform Measures, Crisis Can Be Avoided, Western Allies Show Willingness to Compromise</h3>

<h3>Japanese Have New Invention of Radio Facsimile, Able to Directly Transmit Originals</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 24th] The new invention of using radio to transmit calligraphy and Chinese characters was successfully demonstrated here today by the Kyodo News Agency. The agency will replace its existing radio system with this new type of machine by the end of the year. This invention is the result of two years of research by the agency's laboratory. It can transmit handwritten or typed documents directly to any distance by landline or radio. The original's authentic traces appear on the paper tape at the receiving end, saving the current radio facsimile process.</p>
<h3>Nishio No-Confidence Motion Rejected by Japanese House of Representatives</h3>
<p>Katayama Advises Nishio to Resign Voluntarily</p>
<p>[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 24th] The no-confidence motion against Nishio, submitted to the plenary session of the House of Representatives scheduled for 6:15 PM on the 24th, was rejected as a result of the vote.

<p>[Another Dispatch] Nishio visited Katayama on the afternoon of the 23rd to discuss important matters concerning his resignation. Subsequently, Asanuma and Miki also met with Katayama. The content of the Nishio-Katayama meeting was relayed to House Speaker Matsudo by the two. Katayama's intention is still to treat the Nishio incident as an internal party matter as much as possible to open up the situation. Therefore, after 7:00 PM, he reconvened cabinet members and party executives from the Socialist Party to hold a supreme leadership meeting, once again advising Nishio to resign voluntarily. On the other hand, Nishio, considering the strong atmosphere within the party demanding his resignation, seems to have softened his stance on refusing to resign, only stating: "My state of mind has not been understood by people."</p>
<h3>US Invites Foreign Journalists to Japan to Observe Japanese Police and Coast Guard, Aiming to Quell Criticism from Eastern Countries Against the US</h3>
<p>[United Press, Tokyo, 24th] At the request of the State Department, the US military authorities today invited foreign journalists to observe the training of Japanese police and coast guard, hoping to stop the criticism from the Soviet Union and Eastern countries that the United States is cultivating Japanese military power. However, only journalists from China and the United States accepted the invitation. In the rural police training school and the Tokyo city recruit training school, the weapons seen by the journalists were no larger than handguns. According to Chief of Security of the Allied General Headquarters, Prime, of the 125,000 police officers in Japan, only 12,000 have service pistols. The Coast Guard is entirely unarmed, but those who can obtain pistols are allowed to carry them. If former special service teams and secret police are excluded, Japan's current police force, though doubled compared to wartime, is still less than what democratic countries actually need.</p>

<h3>British Tramway Workers Briefly Go on Strike, Workers Raise Six Demands, Comply with Order to Resume Normal Operations and Await Mediation</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] Yesterday morning, in heavy rain, the workers of the British tramway company went on strike. All trams and trolleybuses on all routes did not leave the depot. All workers gathered at the Changde Road and Tilanqiao depots. Upon hearing the news, Mayor Wu telegraphed the Social Affairs Bureau, ordering the tram service to return to normal within two hours. After Zhao Banfu, Deputy Director of the Social Affairs Bureau, and Shen Ding, Director of the Labor Affairs Department, convened representatives of the company's labor union and earnestly persuaded them, all workers, respecting government laws and regulations, resumed work one after another from 12:20 PM yesterday, awaiting a solution.</p>
<p>It is reported that there are three reasons for the workers' strike: (1) During the 7th National Games, ticket seller No. 881, inspector No. 153, and driver No. 130 of the company were selected as representatives for the national wrestling competition. At that time, the Municipal Education Bureau notified the company to grant them official leave, and the Social Affairs Bureau approved the company to pay the three their wages during the National Games period, but the company authorities have not yet complied. (2) The company is plotting to undermine the labor union and alienate workers' feelings. Recently, the company requested the Social Affairs Bureau to allow four senior employees to withdraw from the labor union. The Social Affairs Bureau approved two, and the company authorities each added 30 yuan to their base salaries to show preferential treatment. (3) Matteson, the acting transportation superintendent, arbitrarily dismissed ticket seller No. 277, Que Dasong, and ticket seller No. 1209, Shu Guiqing. When Que and Shu requested reinstatement from Matteson, they were beaten severely by Matteson and another British employee, Goldstein, causing Que's head to bleed profusely.</p>
<p>Due to the above reasons, workers' public anger was aroused, and they raised six demands to the company authorities the day before yesterday: (1) Replace and punish Transportation Superintendent Matteson; (2) Punish timekeeper No. 433; (3) Reinstate ticket sellers No. 1209 and No. 277; (4) Prohibit listening to irresponsible and unsubstantiated "cold reports"; (5) Dismiss employees who withdrew from the labor union; (6) Promptly pay the wages of the representatives who participated in the National Games. After the above conditions were raised, the company did not provide a concrete response, leading to yesterday's strike.</p>
<p>Union Representatives Return to Depot to Persuade</p>
<p>Union Chairman Qiu Changjiang, along with directors Zheng Yangda and Zhou Qingfang, visited Deputy Director Zhao of the Social Affairs Bureau at around 10:00 AM yesterday. Zhao expressed great sympathy for the workers' oppression by Matteson. However, because the tramway is crucial to the city's traffic, he advised the three representatives to first persuade all workers to resume work to avoid affecting the city's traffic. After the three representatives returned to the depot and earnestly persuaded all workers, the workers, understanding the importance of the situation and abiding by government laws and regulations, painfully resumed work first. As a result, all trams from the Changde Road depot departed first at 12:20 PM at noon, and the last tram on route 5 from the Tilanqiao depot also departed at 2:45 PM in the afternoon.</p>
<p>Social Affairs Bureau Advises Company</p>
<p>Deputy Director Zhao summoned Kanaal, the British human resources superintendent of the company, for a discussion yesterday afternoon, inquiring about the various conditions raised by the workers. According to Deputy Director Zhao's statement to reporters afterwards: (1) Regarding the replacement of Matteson, it is an administrative issue for the company, and the Social Affairs Bureau is not in a position to interfere, but the company has been warned to treat the workers with a kind attitude. (2) The dismissed ticket inspectors will be handled after the reasons are investigated. (3) The company has also been advised to cancel the "cold reports" clause. (4) If the employees who withdrew from the union were indeed given additional base salaries by the company, it is quite inappropriate and should be reduced. (5) The company should pay the workers who participated in the National Games in full.</p>
<p>Although the British tramway workers resumed work yesterday, the problem has not yet been resolved. The workers are quietly waiting for the Social Affairs Bureau to mediate today.</p>
<h3>Tea Shop Treatment Dispute, Employees Strike and Petition Yesterday</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] Tea shop employees in this city, dissatisfied that dozens of tea merchants, including Wang Yutai and Wang Yiji, have delayed fulfilling the agreement to adjust treatment, went on strike yesterday and petitioned the Social Affairs Bureau. The Mediation Section of the Labor Affairs Department of the Social Affairs Bureau received the labor representatives, advising them to resume work first. The issue of adjusting base salaries will be discussed and resolved next Monday when representatives from both labor and management are convened. It is reported that the employees have agreed to resume work first and await mediation.</p>
<h3>Fourth Day of the Senate General Assembly, Examining Proposals All Day, Social Affairs Section Has as Many as Twenty-Four Items, Finance and Police Sections Are Most Widely Involved</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] Yesterday was the fourth day of the sixth general assembly of the City Senate. Various group review meetings were convened all day to review proposals related to each group. Starting from around 9:00 AM, seven groups, including finance, public utilities, social affairs, education, police, self-government, and public works, successively held meetings, which ended around 7:00 PM. Today will be another full day of group review meetings. Starting at 9:00 AM, there will be three groups: land administration, budget and final accounts, and individual regulations. Starting at 3:00 PM in the afternoon, there will be four groups: health, self-government regulations, human rights protection, and policy report.</p>
<p>Yesterday's group review meetings were attended not only by the review committee members of each group, but also by responsible persons from relevant bureaus of the municipal government. The social affairs section had the most proposals, the public utilities and public works sections were the most complex, the finance and police sections were the most widely involved, and the education and self-government sections were relatively simple. The situation of the review of cases by each group will be recorded below, selecting the more significant ones:</p>
<p>Suggest Investigating Wealthy Capital</p>
<p>Finance Section: The key cases for which the review opinion requested the general assembly to pass the case as is included: (1) Telegraphing the local legislators to solemnly support the collection of temporary property taxes to average social wealth and save the crisis. Also, request the Legislative Yuan to stop collecting property taxes and immediately formulate a law to investigate the capital of the wealthy to stabilize people's hearts and balance wealth. (2) Sending a letter from the municipal government to the Gold Management Bureau, requesting the immediate abolition of the method that customer checks cannot be used on the same day. (3) Urgently telegraphing the central government to temporarily transfer the funds and deposits that Chinese people have evaded abroad as a reserve for reforming the monetary system. (4) Requesting the Control Yuan to thoroughly investigate and announce the truth about the central bank's use of foreign exchange and the management of exporters over the past two years. (5) Suggesting that the central government strengthen securities trading institutions and expand stock market transactions to divert floating capital and stabilize prices.</p>
<p>Promote the Establishment of the United Electric Company</p>
<p>Public Utilities Section: After review, in addition to planning to ask the general assembly to pass a motion asking the municipal government to submit to the central government to immediately cancel the restrictions on the transfer of car ownership, regarding the addition, extension, or restoration of public buses on various lines, as well as the improvement and installation of various public utility projects, it was proposed to send them to the Public Utilities Bureau for reference or handling. In order to increase industrial production, a proposal was made to ask the municipal government to order the power company to crack down on the measures to stop power supply to yarn factories, and it was proposed to study the method and promote the early establishment of the United Electric Company. The suggestion that the central government abolish the automatic adjustment method for public utilities was proposed to be submitted to the Public Utilities Mediation Committee for review.</p>

<h3>Military Friendship Society Board Meeting, Decided to Request the Garrison Command to Unseal, Temporarily Request Bail for Liu Deming</h3>
<p>The Military Friendship Society in this city was sealed up and its president Liu Deming was detained, which has been many days. The society's business has been suspended. A few days ago, the chairman of the society, Tang Enbo, was in Nanjing, requesting the acting chairman Fang Zhi to convene an emergency standing board meeting in Shanghai. The meeting was held at the Lido Garden in this city at 12:00 noon yesterday. The standing directors in the Nanjing-Shanghai area present included Xuan Tiewu, Du Yuesheng, Pan Gongzhan, Wang Xiaolai, Wu Kaixian, Xu Jigang, Hu Xiyuan, Shui Xiangyun, Luo Dunwei, Hu Qiuyuan, Fang Zhi, and Chuan Zhengmo.

After the meeting, the acting chairman Fang Zhi chaired the meeting and reported on the significance of convening the emergency meeting, stating briefly: The society was suddenly sealed up a few days ago, and President Liu Deming was also arrested due to a misunderstanding. The Military Friendship Society is a legal local social organization engaged in military-civilian cooperation. Liu Deming is a member recommended by the board of directors to preside over the society's affairs. The houses and some furniture he used in Shanghai were all legally leased by the society from the Factory Pseudo-Property Management Bureau and the Central Trust Bureau. The documents are all there. Today's meeting hopes that you gentlemen will take the stand of the Military Friendship Society and express your opinions on how to deal with the society's problems. Then, Director Pan Gongzhan spoke, stating briefly: The society is one of the social organizations in this city. Its past work achievements and its performance in organizing military support work in recent years are undeniably true facts. The society itself has no illegal activities and should be unsealed and resume business as soon as possible. Whether President Liu himself has committed a crime is another matter and should be his responsibility. Before it is determined, it seems possible to request bail pending trial. If he is indeed illegal, then no one can protect him, etc. Subsequently, directors Wang Xiaolai, Hu Qiuyuan, and Luo Dunwei spoke one after another. Finally, a unanimous decision was made: (1) After the society was sealed up, outsiders did not know the truth and made many speculations. The situation of today's meeting should be publicly announced to correct the situation. (2) This society will submit a request to the Songhu Garrison Command, stating the reasons and requesting unsealing. (3) The current status of the society will be maintained, and the reorganization of future business will be decided by the acting chairman Fang to determine three to five directors to organize a reorganization committee to be responsible for handling it. (4) The directors present will personally sign to temporarily request bail for President Liu Deming, who will be available upon request. The meeting adjourned at 3:00 PM.</p>

<h3>A Pioneering Achievement in China's Railway History: Luxurious "Air-Conditioned Train" Scheduled to Run on the Beijing-Shanghai Line</h3>
<p>[Special Report from This Newspaper] People living in the midst of war and struggling for the bare necessities of life almost cannot believe that in this era, they can still hear news of progress and construction. However, this is a true fact. The Qishuyan Locomotive Factory of the Two Railway Bureaus is building a "Cool Fire Train," unprecedented in China. Its equipment, structure, and performance are comparable to the first-class trains currently running on European and American railways. The materials it needs, except for a very small number of special parts, are bought with foreign exchange. The remaining 95% are pieced together by ourselves, so the cost is much cheaper. According to their estimates, the cost of each "air-conditioned train" is about 50,000 US dollars. If you order from an American car dealer? 150,000 US dollars per car, and they are not willing to deliver within a short period of time.</p>
<p>Seamless Canvas Seal</p>
<p>The "Air-Conditioned Train" is streamlined, with a large round head and a small round tail. The joints between the two carriages are sealed with thick canvas. From a distance, it looks like a whole, and you can't clearly distinguish each carriage. The canvas is tightened with strong springs, so turning left and right is easy. The windows are made of double-layer glass and embedded in the carriage walls and cannot be opened to prevent heat transfer. Each passenger car has doors at both ends. When passengers get on and off, the doors open, and a small steel ladder automatically extends and lowers. When the door closes, the small ladder automatically retracts and hides under the carriage, which is exquisite and ingenious. For the color of the train, the Railway Bureau specially invited Professor Chen of the Art Department of Central University to design it. The roof is painted silver-gray, and the bottom is painted bright red and cream, with military green at the very bottom. The colors are bright and artistic.</p>
<p>Total Power Generation is 100 Kilowatts</p>
<p>The train is divided into nine carriages. The first carriage is the locomotive, and the second carriage is the generator carriage. After that, there are three consecutive passenger cars. After the three passenger cars, there is a dining car, and behind the dining car, there are two passenger cars. The last carriage is an observation car. The generator carriage is equipped with a small, powerful generator with a power generation of 100 kilowatts, which is just enough to supply the entire train's electricity needs for air conditioning, electric stoves, electric lights, and refrigerators. The remaining space in the generator carriage is used for luggage, postal, and conductor's rooms. Each part is separated by iron doors to ensure safety.</p>
<p>Equipped with Movable Sofa Seats</p>
<p>Passenger cars have two major features: air conditioning and movable sofa seats. The air conditioner is also small, only the size of four seats. Each passenger car is equipped with one unit. The sofa seat is modeled after and improved from the easy chairs in the China National Aviation Corporation's Boeing aircraft. In addition to being able to adjust the backrest up and down, the backrest can also be pulled back to reverse the seat. Because the seats in the carriage are arranged in order, this allows familiar passengers to sit face-to-face like in ordinary train seats. Each passenger car has 50 seats, assigned by number, with the number marked on the top of the chair back. There is also a special small iron frame on the side of the chair back for placing military tickets. After passengers take their seats, they insert the ticket into the frame, and then close their eyes and rest. No ticket inspector will bother you for a while.</p>
<h3>Observation Car for Passengers to Enjoy the Scenery</h3>
<p>Both the dining car and the observation car have air conditioning. The dining car restaurant has ten tables and can accommodate 32 people at the same time. The observation car has a small bar, serving wine, snacks, and cold drinks. The layout is modeled after international and Kinmen bars. At the end, there are ten rotating single sofas for passengers to enjoy the scenery along the way. There are also five radios for passengers to listen to at will.</p>
<p>This only luxurious and beautiful train in China's railway history will run on the Beijing-Shanghai line on July 15th, traveling between Beijing and Shanghai once a day. The fare is 20% to 30% higher than the Triumphant, which is not yet determined. More than 300 workers are working day and night to rush to complete the painting and assembly.</p>

Therefore, the prices of stocks, cloth, and other goods that had been stable rose again.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the banks in this city showed a phenomenon of being tight on the surface but loose in reality due to the large influx of northern hot money into Shanghai. In the clearing of bills by the silver houses, the Four Banks, Two Bureaus, and One Treasury once again reversed the situation of the previous day's large advance and showed a large deficit, totaling 854.3 billion yuan. The Central Bank had a deficit of 21.1 billion yuan, the Bank of Communications had a deficit of 51.5 billion yuan, and the China Trust Bureau had a deficit of 48.3 billion yuan.

<h3>Authorities Pay Attention to Traveler's Checks</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] Recently, many banks and firms in this city have developed traveler's checks to meet actual needs and circulate them on the market. The Financial Supervisory Bureau is paying close attention to this. Insiders said: If the use of such checks affects the market, effective measures will be taken to stop it.</p>
<p>In addition: Recently, the Central Bank has been working hard to tighten credit, and the banks and firms are generally short of funds. The Central Bank has allowed the fixed deposits stored in the bank and the short-term treasury bills purchased by the banks and firms to offset the clearing difference.</p>
<h3>Foreign Exchange Settlement Certificates Hit a New High Yesterday</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] The selling price of foreign exchange settlement certificates rose sharply again yesterday.

<h3>Overseas Chinese Supervisory Committee Member Kuang Yaopu Hopes to Improve Overseas Remittance Policy and Allow Overseas Chinese to Purchase and Transport Materials Back to the Country</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 24th] Kuang Yaopu, the only overseas Chinese supervisory committee member who returned to the country to attend the Supervisory Yuan meeting, made a speech, hoping that the government would revise a good method for overseas remittances and the transfer of overseas Chinese capital to the country. It is estimated that overseas remittances to China are about 200 million to 300 million US dollars per year. If there are appropriate policies and appropriate use, it will have a great effect on balancing China's international balance of payments. However, the current exchange rate of the Central Bank is almost twice as high as the black market, so almost all overseas remittances have escaped to Hong Kong.</p>
<p>On the one hand, our country is calling for the transfer of overseas Chinese capital to the country, but on the other hand, it does not allow overseas Chinese to purchase and transport materials for import with their original foreign exchange funds. The production of materials such as machinery and raw materials is also subject to various restrictions. In this way, even if overseas Chinese capital wants to be transferred to the country, there is no way to do so. Therefore, it is hoped that the Export and Import Management Committee will allow overseas Chinese to purchase and transport materials that are beneficial to China's construction with their accumulated wealth abroad for import. This move can encourage the transfer of overseas Chinese capital to the country, and it will definitely be of great help to the country's production and construction.</p>

<h3>Savings Deposit Guarantee Fund for Banks and Bureaus to be Collected and Paid on a Monthly Basis</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] National banks and bureaus once requested exemption from paying savings deposit guarantee reserve. It is now known that the Ministry of Finance has telegraphed the National Bank and the Four Joint Offices, rejecting the request, saying that they should still follow the regulations and adjust it once a month, allowing each bank and bureau to collect and pay it in total, and government bonds can be used to offset the payment.</p>
<p>In addition, the Central Bank previously approved the request of the local postal and remittance bureaus to be exempted from paying the savings deposit guarantee reserve through its branches and offices. The Ministry of Finance also replied by telegram, stating that the postal and remittance bureaus are also one of the national banks and bureaus, and the nature of deposits is also the same, so the guarantee reserve should also be deposited in the same way as other national banks and bureaus.</p>
<h3>Bustling Guest Merchants' Shopping and Trading, Cotton Yarn and Cloth are Both Bullish</h3>

<h3>Production Areas Rise, People's Minds are Firm and High, Food Rice Prices Rise Again, Flour, Grain, Oil, and Cakes are All Hovering at High Prices</h3>
<p>The rice market rose in the east, because prices in production areas such as Wuxi continued to rise, which made people's minds firm and high. In addition, due to rainy weather, the arrival of goods was reduced, and the owners took the opportunity to raise prices, and the market was revitalized. The price increase was stronger in the North City market, with white japonica reaching 145 million, an increase of 600,000 yuan. Thin rice rose by 700,000 to 143 million yuan.

<h3>Wimbledon Tennis Championships Mixed Doubles First Round; He Aiying's Team Eliminated; French Veterans Triumph in Men's Doubles</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Wimbledon, 23rd] After two days of intermittent showers, the weather suddenly cleared today, and the crowds reached a record high since the opening of the tournament. The men's doubles and mixed doubles both opened today. In the men's doubles, all four seeded teams advanced smoothly, while the pre-war doubles champions, the French veterans Borotra and Brugnon, attracted the attention of the crowd. The two players have a combined age of 103, but still defeated the physically strong Polish doubles representatives Spychala and Tloczynski. In the mixed doubles, Chinese female player He Aiying and her Indian partner Sony unfortunately lost to Swedish Bergelin and French Mrs. Poudrille. The score was 7-5, 6-2. The Soh team was able to seize the advantage, initially leading 5-2, but then lost five straight games and lost the first set 5-7. In the second set, Bergelin's bullet-like serves left Soh unable to defend, and they succumbed to defeat.</p>
<p>The results of the men's doubles are as follows:</p>
<p>Parker, Falkenburg (USA) def. Muller (South Africa), Cosgrave (England) 6-1, 6-3, 6-0.</p>

<h3>Farewell to Readers</h3>
<p>— Liang Junqing</p>
<p>Due to the need to cooperate with the suppression of the rebellion and national reconstruction, and to save paper, this medical journal has been decided to be suspended from July 1st, along with other weekly publications of this newspaper. This is truly a very regrettable thing!</p>
<p>For the past year or so, we have adhered to a principle: "To introduce the world's latest medicine to our readers in a simple and easy-to-understand way." Although we dare not say that we have achieved any success in fact, since the publication of this journal, we have received the support and encouragement of countless readers. We receive many letters from readers every day. This shows the enthusiasm of readers for this journal. We ask ourselves, how can we not strive and work harder! Therefore, we are also planning various plans to improve this journal in the future: such as writing short comments, simple introductions to world medicine, patient testimonials, and questions and answers from patient families, etc. We want to use a light and clear tone to describe them in neat and uniform short texts. In our hands, there are still several articles such as "The Latest Treatment for Typhoid Fever", "Causes and Treatment of Childhood Enuresis", "Causes and Treatment of Deforming Polyarthritis", and "The Latest Diagnostic Methods for Early Pulmonary Tuberculosis", etc. These are all very beneficial short articles for readers, but God is unwilling to fulfill people's wishes, and they can only not meet the readers with the suspension of this journal. Therefore, this is also a very regrettable thing!</p>
<p>Okay, let's not say it! Saying more only increases sadness. I hope that our country can be peaceful soon, and perhaps we can have a day when we can meet again in this newspaper, or other newspapers!</p>
<h3>Regarding the Side Effects of Bayer's Copper Preparation and its Usage Method</h3>
<p>— Liang Junqing</p>
<p>However, because the toxicity of this copper preparation is very high, and injections often cause vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, and nephritis, etc., everyone is afraid to try it, so copper preparations are gradually being eliminated. Later, Ritter re-analyzed it chemically and then realized that copper preparations are not able to kill tuberculosis bacteria in the human body. On the contrary, if it is combined with a certain organism, then it will not only not harm people but can also stimulate the reticular endothelial cells in the human body, causing it to produce immune and antitoxic effects, which can gradually improve the disease and gradually recover. Ritter first published the details of his treatment of 30 patients with pulmonary tuberculosis with copper preparations, and the results were very satisfactory. This re-aroused the attention of many scholars. From 1940 to 1942, Arldr, Ritter, Manttarsch and others successively published papers praising the efficacy of copper preparations. Therefore, Bayer of Germany manufactured a copper preparation originally named Cuyrian, later renamed Ebesal (that is, Bayer's Copper Preparation), which has been used by countless doctors, and the results have been satisfactory. Previously, Dr. Fei Naxu, a German professor of internal medicine at National Tongji University, also published a paper detailing the efficacy of copper preparations in the treatment of pulmonary tuberculosis. Unfortunately, because it was during the period of occupation, everyone was indifferent. After the victory, because Germany failed, the pharmaceuticals of Bayer of Germany were sealed as enemy property, so no one cared about them and became unpopular. It is truly wronged!</p>
<p>The author has also used "Bayer's Copper Preparation" in more than ten cases, and the results, except for one case of acute pulmonary tuberculosis that did not work, have been very satisfactory in the rest. However, it also has various side effects, which must be noted: (1) There may be mild or high fever after injection; (2) The whole body may be very tired, or dizzy and headache; (3) If the number of injections is too close, then pharyngitis may occur, causing unbearable pain; (4) Sometimes nephritis may occur; (5) After copper is injected into the body, it is mostly stored in the liver and spleen, and then gradually excreted in the large intestine within two months. Therefore, if too much is injected, or the injection interval is too short, then it can cause toxic symptoms.</p>
<p>As for its method of use? I think the following points should be noted.</p>
<p>(1) Before use, the patient must be carefully examined, such as X-ray, examination of white blood cell classification and count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and tuberculosis bacteria in the sputum. It must be determined that it is initial or nodular tuberculosis before it can be used.</p>
<p>(2) The usage described on the package insert is unreliable. Each injection must be matched with the patient's physical condition so as not to cause accidents. It is best to use each dose at least twice. For example, use 0.01 twice before increasing to the second dose on the third time.</p>
<p>(3) The interval between each injection should not be too close, at least four days or seven or eight days apart, depending on the severity of the reaction and the condition of the body.</p>
<p>(4) If the total amount of injection reaches 0.8 or 7.2gm days, do not inject it again. It must be reused after resting for two months.</p>
<p>Regarding the advantages of Bayer's Copper Preparation, I can briefly add the following:</p>
<p>(1) In addition to the above-mentioned points that must be avoided, its scope of application is very wide.</p>
<p>(2) If air needle injection and surgery are not possible, it can replace them.</p>
<p>(3) Its price is very cheap, and poor patients can use it (it is expected that a total of three doses, about ten injections per dose, for a total of 30 injections, and the patient suffers very little from the pain of injecting 30 injections within 12 months.</p>
<p>(4) After the injection, the patient's appetite increases, the fever decreases, the cough decreases, and the sputum decreases, which is very beneficial to the patient's psychology.</p>
<p>The above is my honest view of "Bayer's Copper Preparation". As long as it is properly used by doctors, it is the most economical and proper special agent for pulmonary tuberculosis. (To be continued)</p>
<h3>Snake Venom Treats Epilepsy</h3>
<p>— Cang Long</p>
<p>Everyone knows that epilepsy is a difficult disease to treat. A person who is working (or studying) suddenly stares blankly, foams at the mouth, and experiences stiff, twitching hands and feet. When the seizure is severe, they become completely unconscious and only return to normal after one or two hours. After such a "seizure," they are just like ordinary people, with no particular symptoms. But if you want to treat it then, it's practically impossible. You can give them bromides, herbal remedies, and medications like Luminal and Chloral, but besides slightly reducing the severity of the "seizure," there is practically nothing else you can do. However, if you ignore it and do nothing, the condition will worsen and become more frequent. If the patient has a seizure while going up or down stairs, getting on or off a car or train, or on a ferry, they could fall and die or drown. Therefore, when it comes to treating epilepsy, many doctors shake their heads in despair.</p>
<p>Since Dr. R. Sprangler of Philadelphia, USA, published a paper in 1929 on using snake venom to cure epilepsy, many scholars have followed suit. Many scholars in Europe and America have subsequently written articles praising its effectiveness. Dr. Fitz Simons of Germany even wrote a dedicated book discussing the benefits of snake venom in detail. It is said that many doctors in the United States are now using snake venom to treat epilepsy. According to the modern medical dictionary edited by Gutman in the United States in 1946, there are two types of snake venom: one with hemostatic properties and the other with analgesic and nerve-inhibiting properties (Neurotoxisch). This Neurotoxisch effect is now being used to treat epilepsy with great success. If the epilepsy is not caused by trauma, there is a good chance of recovery. Even if it is traumatic, it can significantly reduce the frequency of seizures to once every few months or once a year.</p>
<h3>New Medical Knowledge</h3>
<p>— Cang Long</p>
<p>Pneumoperitoneum for Treating Intestinal Tuberculosis</p>
<p>This method has been tried in the United States with some success. According to a report in J. Med. Lyon. 1947, No. 28, Vachon and Feit have also experimented with it, and the results are very satisfactory and worth introducing. It is said that this method is relatively safe, with 800 cc of air injected into the abdominal cavity every two, four, or seven days. The 800 cc of air should be maintained in the abdominal cavity for four or five months (because the air in the abdominal cavity can be gradually absorbed by the peritoneum, reducing its volume, it must be replenished regularly). Patients feel that their condition improves after several air injections, with reduced diarrhea, abdominal distension, abdominal pain, and intestinal noises. Their appetite improves, their weight increases, and the tubercular lesions in their lungs also improve.</p>
<p>The Latest Treatment for Angina Pectoris</p>
<p>According to last year's British Medical Journal (P. 4532), A. A. Fitrgerald Peel used the "anticoagulant" drug Dicumarol to treat angina pectoris, with very good results. However, he said that it is not easy to see results with this drug alone. It must be used with intravenous injections of glucose solution and physiological saline, along with Cardophyllin or Euphyllin (using drip infusion) to be effective. This is because many angina patients often experience collapse during an angina attack and are difficult to save, so the above method must be used to treat the heart collapse effect at the same time to be effective.</p>

<h3>Preface to the Study of the Jiang Clan Genealogy of Wuling</h3>
<p>— Jiang Zhongzheng</p>
<p>[Editor's Note: It has recently been discovered that President Jiang's ancestors descended from the Duke of Zhou. This newspaper has obtained an essay written by the President titled "Preface to the Study of the Jiang Clan Genealogy of Wuling," which was personally written by the President in calligraphy on Xuan paper and will be included in the Jiang family genealogy in Fenghua. We are honored to publish it first.]</p>
<p>The Zuo Zhuan states, "All Jiang, Xing, Mao, Zuo, and Ji clans are descendants of the Duke of Zhou." That our Jiang clan descended from the Duke of Zhou is believable and well-documented. However, the genealogies have been scattered and lost, and the ancestral lineage has been vaguely recorded, which I have always lamented. In November of the thirty-second year of the Republic [1943], during the commemoration of my late mother's 70th birthday, my eldest son, Jingguo, had someone secretly bring the clan genealogy from our hometown, which had been occupied by Japanese bandits, to Gan, and then finally to Chongqing. I repeatedly read it, almost forgetting sleep and food, and my thoughts of cherishing my late mother's kindness and repaying my roots grew stronger. The old genealogy lists the generations starting from Lord Yan Gong during the Five Dynasties period. Before that, it was said that they came from Tiantai, or that they used to live in Kuocang, but the details were unknown. Since returning to the capital after the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, I have been collecting genealogies from Jiang clans in various parts of Jiangsu and Zhejiang, comparing and examining them, but still without any clues. The years are too distant, and the records have long been missing. Later, a clansman from Tianhe showed me an old handwritten copy of the Jiang clan genealogy of Nengshan, Longshan is in Ninghai, and does not belong to the Jiang clan system in Tiantai. I don't know how its genealogy entered Tiantai. The genealogy contains a branch of Lord Maha and Lord Jinzi, and it also records that Lord Jinzi and his descendants were buried in Sanling, Qin Xiao Township, Fenghua. I was overjoyed, but I regretted that the compilation was not strict and not done by a scholar. The recorded generations also had errors in entering side branches and reversing the order of time. As a single copy, I dared not believe it hastily. After a long time, I found the names of Lord Yan Gong and Lord Maha in the genealogies of the Jiang clan of Hengshan, Yin County, and the Jiang clan of Eyang, Juhua. Yan Gong's father's name was Xian, who once served as a Jianjian officer in Siming and was the first to move to Mingzhou. His grandfather's name was Da, and he had four or five brothers, all using this character as their name. Comparing it with the genealogies of the Jiang clans in Linhai, Huangyan, and Xianju, all have the names of these brothers, although the order may vary slightly. However, the compilation of these genealogies is superior and each version is consistent, so it should be more credible than the genealogy of Longshan. Therefore, I cross-referenced, detailed, and carefully verified, starting with Lord Yuanqing, the governor of Yanzhou in the Han Dynasty, and connecting with the old genealogy. There are thirty-three generations with a verifiable lineage, with a clear lineage and no errors after repeated verification, which is enough to comfort my lifelong ambition to trace my roots. Then, I further explored the traces of our ancestral home and migrations. Those with historical records to prove it: Zhou initially conferred the Jiang state, which later became Chu Qisi Township. In the Liu Song dynasty, it was renamed Lean, and in the Zhao Song dynasty, it was Xianju County, Guang Prefecture, which is now the territory of Gushi County, Henan. During the Han Dynasty, the descendants of the Jiang clan moved to Duling. In the fourth generation of Lord Yuanqing, Lord Shaoming, the Marquis of Mianting, moved to Yangxian. After passing through to Lord Boji, the prefect of Wu County in Jin, he moved to Taizhou. After another twenty generations, he moved to Mingzhou, which is roughly the situation. From Lord Yuanqing onwards, it has been more than a thousand years since the initial enfeoffment in the Zhou Dynasty. The genealogies of Yixing, Linhai, and Datian record in detail the generations and titles, thoroughly organized without omissions. However, there is no evidence in history, so I dare not agree blindly. I respectfully follow the example of attaching doubts and wait for future revisions. Alas! After the chaos of the Five Dynasties, the genealogies of noble families were lost. Ouyang Xiu compiled the "Table of Ancestral Lineages of Prime Ministers" for the Tang Dynasty and generally only traced back to the Liang, Chen, Wei, and Zhou dynasties. Our Jiang clan can still seek its ancestors and reach the Han Dynasty, with an unbroken lineage for two thousand years. How fortunate! The study of ethnicity is valued in our country. Although it has undergone several periods of turmoil and the old records are flawed, the origins can still be traced if we are careful in our research. This year, Wuzi [1948], our clan is revising the genealogy. We have specially hired Mr. Wu of Wujin as the director to take charge of the matter, and Mr. Chen of Cixi and Mr. Sha Wenruo of Yin County as compilers to assist in its completion. I have respectfully read the study of the ancestral lineage, which is clear in its logic and meticulously researched. I am delighted that it can reveal what previous generations have not and fulfill my long-held wishes, so I write this preface. The Book of Poetry says, "Rise early and retire late, do not disgrace those who gave birth to you." The Book of Documents says, "The millet and sorghum are not fragrant, but bright virtue is fragrant." May all descendants of the Jiang clan remember this! Eleventh day of June, thirty-seventh year of the Republic of China [1948], Zhou Tai, the 118th generation descendant of Siming, respectfully wrote and inscribed in Nanjing.</p>
<h3>Reminiscences of Sichuan Opera</h3>
<p>— You Jin</p>
<p>Recently, it was reported that former Executive Yuan Premier Zhang Qun flew back to Chongqing from Beijing and indulged in his Sichuan opera addiction with Mayor Yang Sen and others. Mr. Zhang is from Sichuan, so he has a special fondness for Sichuan opera. Nostalgia is common to all, and of course, Mr. Zhang is no exception.</p>
<p>Although I am not from Sichuan, I have also listened to Sichuan opera in Sichuan Province. I remember the first time I listened to Sichuan opera was at a grand reception. After three rounds of drinks, the host's welcome speech and the guest's thank you speech were all delivered. Suddenly, a deafening sound of gongs and drums erupted from the adjacent courtyard, "Kuang, Kuang, Kuang," "Tang, Tang, Tang," almost shattering our eardrums.</p>
<p>Following the unsettling sound of gongs and drums was a shrill blast from a large trumpet. This is called "naotai," and the reason why Sichuan opera is also known as Gaoqiang (high-pitched) is probably because the tunes are extremely激越高亢high and loud. As for silk and bamboo instruments, strings, and clappers, they are all complete, like Qinqiang and Han songs. Sometimes, they are sad and melancholic; sometimes, they are crisp and refreshing, still retaining their artistic value.</p>
<p>That day, we heard Jia Peizhi's Laosheng, Chen Bixiu's Qingyi, and Xue Yanqiu's Huadan. The plays they sang included historical dramas such as Zhaojun Goes Beyond the Great Wall, Houchang Hui, Mei Nengzhen, Gongren Jing, and Farewell My Concubine. Although the stories are similar to Peking Opera, the lyrics are completely different. It is said that Jia Peizhi's reputation in Sichuan opera is equivalent to Ma Lianliang in Peking Opera, and Chen Bixiu is somewhat like Mei Lanfang. The Huadan Xue Yanqiu is a woman, and her reputation is equal to that of Xue Yancin in Peking Opera at the time.</p>
<p>There was a person named Tang Guangti, who had a position similar to Xiao Changhua in Peking Opera. He was very popular in Sichuan. Although he did not come to the performance that day, I still saw him in the theater later. His strength lay in playing jokes and saying lines. He was very fat and full of humor. Every word and action made the audience laugh.</p>
<p>In addition, there was an old Sichuan opera actor named Kang Zilin, who was a good man with a chivalrous heart. He was a martial artist with excellent fighting skills. Even when he was in his seventies, the audience insisted on him performing on stage. Although his martial arts skills were good, his physical strength was not enough. Once, during a particularly energetic performance, he fell on the stage, became ill after the performance, and died soon after! When he died, not only did the actors cry for him as if he were their parent, but almost everyone in society shed tears for him, showing the great power of his moving personality. Kang had many disciples, including many female disciples. When he was young, he often had the opportunity to contact women because he taught female disciples martial arts. Countless female disciples admired him, but Kang kept himself clean and did not get involved.</p>
<p>Regarding the compilation of Sichuan opera scripts, such as "Qin Tan," which is the most famous and widely circulated, the lyrics of the songs and lines are extremely elegant, written and revised by Zhao Xi (Yaosheng), a famous scholar in Sichuan. Almost everyone in Sichuan Province can sing a few lines, just like rickshaw drivers in Beijing can sing a few lines of "Visiting Mother in Palace." This is truly a top-notch folk art!</p>
<p>I wonder what kinds of plays Mr. Zhang Yuejun listened to? And what new famous actors are now performing on stage? Old Man Zilin is dead, Yaosheng is still there. Recalling the past, I wish I could go to Sichuan again and indulge in Sichuan opera!</p>
<h3>Wu Kezhai's Diary</h3>
<p>— Qian Dacheng</p>
<p>I have always enjoyed reading diaries of famous people, especially those related to anecdotes. Yesterday, my friend Mr. Cao Jusheng showed me Wu Xianzai's "Diary of an Envoy to Jilin," a manuscript in red grid paper, with nine lines per half-page and varying numbers of words per line. The upper end of the block print has the six characters "Qingyun Xuan Ou Chao" (Casual Copy by Qingyun), with a total of thirty-five leaves and two blank leaves. There is a seal that says "Shi Jiangjun Yin Zhai" (Studio of the Ten Generals Seal). Shi Jiangjun Yin Zhai is the name of Kezhai's studio, located in Shuanglin Alley, Wu County, with the plaque written by Wang Yirong. This diary records from April 21st, Gengchen year of Tongzhi sixth year [1867] to December 19th. At that time, Kezhai, with the honorary title of a local official of the third rank, followed General Mingan of Jilin to handle border defense. The Draft History of Qing states: Xianzai traveled through key passes and learned that the land of Hunchun Heidingzi had long been occupied by Russian invasion. Therefore, he requested the Qing court to issue old boundary maps and schedule a protest with Russian officials, but the decree was not obtained. At that time, there was a man named Han Xiaozhong (Xiaozhong's original name was Bianwai, changed after pacification) who gathered 40,000 to 50,000 people in Jiapigou, Jilin, to resist the Qing army. Xianzai went alone to his camp, stayed overnight for two days, and Xiaozhong surrendered, and he was granted the fifth rank hat. The diary records this in great detail. On the day Kezhai entered the mountain to persuade surrender, he also changed into Manchu clothes, which was in late December. Mr. Qian Jibo once wrote an article recording this event. Mr. Gu Qiqian's compiled Kezhai's chronological biography does not mention this medical practice. Kezhai also has another diary called "Huanghua Jicheng," which is engraved in the "Yin Li Zai Si Tang Congshu" (Collection of the Yin Li Zai Si Tang). The "Northern Expedition Diary" is also a manuscript, which is collected by his great-grandson Mr. Hufan. Jusheng obtained this book from the descendants of his maternal uncle, Zeng Yucang. However, it is unknown from where Yucang obtained it. I will write a longer article to interpret it. Here I just write a few words to record my good fortune.</p>
<h3>Remembering Tan Yuanbo's Martyrdom in Stanley</h3>
<p>— Lu Danlin</p>
<p>Tan Yuanbo of Nanhai (named Changxuan, great-grandson of Yusheng, grandson of Shuyu, Yi Hezi, son-in-law of Li Jipei), taught at St. Stephen's College in Hong Kong for nearly twenty years. He was honest and upright and trusted by all. In the winter of the 30th year of the Republic [1941], when the Japanese army attacked Hong Kong and landed in Stanley, Tan stayed in the school, refusing to evacuate, saying: "Protecting the school and the students is my responsibility." After everyone urged him, he sent his mother and wife away. When the Japanese soldiers entered the school and forcibly demanded the students upstairs, he argued with them. The Japanese soldiers were angry and stabbed him to death with spears. The next day, the old woman he employed and the school janitor buried him in the wilderness outside the school. In the spring of the 31st year of the Republic [1942], Li Jinan led people to pay their respects. The area was covered with weeds and smoke, with no monument or inscription, only a firewood mark inserted to record and identify the place. No one knows what he argued with the Japanese soldiers about that day, as no one was present at the time. Some say that the Japanese soldiers wanted to assault a female teacher, and he scolded them angrily, which led to his murder. After the war, the school publicly buried him on the school grounds and erected a monument in his memory. The inscription was written by Ye Xia'an (Gongchuo) and read: "In December 1941, Japan attacked Hong Kong. Stanley fell on the 24th, and the next day the invaders entered this school. At that time, Mr. Tan was staying behind and was killed for his refusal to submit. Earlier, when the enemy was approaching, the principal advised him to evacuate, but he sent his mother and wife away, and pledged to defend the school and protect the students, thus meeting his demise. Alas, since the founding of the school, many faculty and staff have contributed to the school, but only he alone has died in the line of duty. His name was Changxuan, courtesy name Yuanbo, from Nanhai, Guangdong. His family had a long history of scholarship and was respected by the times. He graduated from this school and entered the University of Hong Kong, receiving a Bachelor of Arts degree. He served as a professor and head of Chinese studies at this school for nearly twenty years. His colleagues admired him, and the students respected and loved him. He is survived by his wife, Li Mo. He had no children. This school respects his daily conduct and his adherence to the right path to the end. There is no one like him at this time. A stone is erected on the school wall to perpetuate his glory and serve as a model for all. Erected with reverence by St. Stephen's College in 1947, written and inscribed by Ye Gongchuo of Panyu."</p>
<p>It is said that Xia'an and his family were close friends. Tan's courtesy name, Yuanbo, was given by Xia'an, hoping that he would become like Ji Yuanli and Fan Mengbo. Xia'an wrote a poem to commemorate Tan's martyrdom: "The green blood is cold on Stanley Hill, singing of dying for a long-held intention. His lone act ultimately moved people to record it, but who knows that his death is a national tragedy? I close my eyes, unable to bear to see the remaining ghosts, sacrificing one's life for the sake of righteousness is not against the norm. The stone of longing for her husband is old and far away, sadly recalling the moonlit corridors of the past." After Tan's martyrdom, his mother died missing her son, and his father died soon after, leaving only his wife. The family line was thus cut off. The ways of Heaven are difficult to know, and this is indeed cruel. When he was publicly buried, a painting of "Burying Jade in the Sea Mountain" was commissioned to solicit inscriptions and express condolences. I think that during the eight years of the Anti-Japanese War, nearly ten million compatriots lost their lives. But there are very few like Tan, who resided overseas and worked diligently until death. Therefore, I specially record this.</p>
<h3>Remembering Jingning</h3>
<p>— Yi Yun</p>
<p>Jingning is the most remote and impoverished county in Zhejiang, bordering Fujian Province (adjacent to Shouning County in Fujian). It used to belong to Chuzhou Prefecture, which was the most impoverished area in Zhejiang, and Jingning was the most impoverished county in Chuzhou. Ask people in Hangzhou, and most of them do not know where Jingning is, which shows how remote it is.</p>
<p>"Fish, dragon, chicken, phoenix, vegetables, lingzhi," is a poem that people used to write about Jingning, because the rivers are narrow and shallow, and the water is clear to the bottom. There are basically no fish a few inches long to be used as food, so the rarity of fish is equal to that of dragons. There are chickens, but not many, and their shape is special. They have tall legs and a thin body. When used as food, there is only skin, tendons, and bones, with very little meat. Because the land is barren and food is scarce, there are few insects, which causes them to be so thin. But the locals consider them precious and do not sell them easily. To find a slightly fatter chicken is as rare as phoenix feathers and unicorn horns, and impossible to find. Vegetables are difficult to grow due to the lack of water in the mountains. Things that are easily obtained elsewhere are very difficult to find in Jingning, equal to lingzhi. The locals mostly eat sweet potatoes and other things. The rice produced has a very bright red color on the outer layer. When cooked into rice, the red is like blood, which is frightening to look at. Even if the outer layer is completely washed off, the rice color is still very dull. Although it is more edible, the locals consider it a treasure, and it is no small sin to waste it. There are no rice shops in the entire city. To buy rice, one must negotiate with wealthy households who own fields. However, the largest landowner in the city only harvests a few tons of grain each year, which shows how little there is. There is also no place to buy pork. If a pig is slaughtered, they must beat a gong everywhere. People can buy meat when they hear the gong, otherwise there is none.</p>
<p>There is a special ethnic group in the area called Shemin. Most of the men live in the mountains and rarely interact with people. The women are employed by the locals to till and plant the land. They wear tight, pleated skirts with layers and layers, but no pants underneath. They wear silver rings as large as four inches in their ears and silver hairpins longer than a foot in their hair. They are very strong and work harder than ordinary people.</p>
<p>Jingning's local products are the best, with growing mushrooms being the most important. Every year in early winter, mushroom growers rent mountain land and buy all the trees on the land. They cut down the trees, remove the branches, and chop the trunks with axes. The ax-wielder must be an experienced mushroom grower, otherwise the depth of the axe cut will not be appropriate, and the mushrooms will not grow. After the trunk is chopped, it is placed on the ground, and all the branches and leaves are placed on top of it, and a wooden fence is built around the perimeter. If there is heavy snow that year, the mushroom harvest will be abundant the following year, otherwise it will be poor. The mushrooms all grow where the tree trunk has been chopped. The first year's harvest is limited, the second year's is abundant, and the third year's is the most abundant. Afterwards, it gradually decreases, and the growers abandon it and move on to other things. Mushroom growers are the largest merchants in Jingning. The area also produces tea leaves, which are as green as Longjing tea, but the leaves are thin and lack flavor, also due to the barren soil. During the Anti-Japanese War, many Zhejiang provincial agencies and people moved to the Lishui and Longquan areas. The adjacent Jingning also saw prosperity. I imagine that it is much more advanced today than it was in the past.</p>
<p>###</p>
<p>In the past, when imperial censors impeached high-ranking officials, their memorials sometimes contained scolding and ridicule (such as An Weijun's impeachment of Li Hongzhang in the Jiawu year [1894]), but it was just excitement on paper, not direct insults that would make a person "dry saliva on their face." However, the members of the two houses of parliament in the early Republic era directly rebuked administrative officials to their faces! At that time, in addition to legislation, the parliament had various privileges such as impeachment, requests for investigation, and summoning administrative officials to attend and answer questions. During the ten years or so of the early Republic, I was a Beijing-based reporter for the Shi Bao and attended all the sessions of Congress, witnessing all sorts of scenes from the press box. When administrative officials were invited to the stage, the questioners below would often confront them aggressively, sometimes adding frivolous remarks, as if it were normal. Once, a high-ranking official was criticized so harshly by several members that he could hardly bear it. As he was about to leave the stage, he angrily said two things: (1) "Criticism is acceptable, but insults are not." (2) "I was also one of you sitting below." After he finished speaking, he left in a huff. Everyone below (the members' seats) and above (the press box) was stunned. His two sentences were concise and to the point, and worthy of reflection.</p>
<p>It turned out that this high-ranking official had also been a member of parliament two years earlier. Later, due to his political talent and activities, he obtained a high administrative position. This time, when he came to the parliament, he became the person on the stage (administrative officials had special seats on both sides of the stage). In the past, when he was below the stage, he was the "impeacher" of those on the stage. Today, being on the stage, he is now the "impeached," so he said, "I was also in the parliamentary seat." The meaning is to warn everyone present that unless you are a member of parliament for life, you will also have to experience this taste once you enter the government. The positions change, and it's only a matter of time. Leaving room for others now is leaving room for yourself in the future.</p>
<p>We reporters in the press box were "clear observers." Regarding the cyclical "confusion of those in authority," we only felt pity. What does it have to do with the country's politics, right and wrong, gain and loss? We can only learn from the Buddha and lament: "If you want to know the cause of your past life, look at what you are experiencing in this life. If you want to know the cause of your present life, look at what you will experience in your next life. Good, good!"</p>
