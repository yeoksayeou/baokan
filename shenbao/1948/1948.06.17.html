<h3>美參院通過援華案　眾院削減部份幾全恢復　正與眾院草擬折衷法案</h3>
<p>〔中央社華盛頓十穴日電〕四億六千萬美元之援華計劃撥款，參院十六日晨討論二小時半後，卒以六十票對九票通過。參院通過此法案後，立即任命代表與衆院代表草擬折衷法案，參院所通過之援華計劃，已恢復衆院所削减之六千三百萬美元中之六千萬美元，並規定四億六千萬美元內，三億三千五百萬美元作爲經濟協助，在經濟合作局掌理下運用，其餘一億二千五百萬美元，則爲贈予中國，可自由處置，作爲軍事或其他用途。參院已使援華計劃之時間恢復爲十二個月，並取消衆院所規定應依據對希土兩國援助辦法監督整個援華計劃一端。參院撥款委會於報告中，竭力敦促謹愼處理經濟援華經費，使勿與作爲軍事用途之一億二千五百萬美元之贈予混淆。該委會認爲倘採取無爲政策，則將產生極爲不幸之後果。該委會稱：對於陸長羅雅爾及魏德邁將軍秘密陳述之意見印象深切。該委會並稱：（討論中國問題時，曾獲悉中國局勢尚有希望）。同時警告國會，遣往中國執行之計劃之美國官員，應爲絕對忠於美國，並屬絕對反共之人士。該委會在報告中，雖敦促爲數一億二千五百萬美元之自由處置贈予，作爲軍事用途，但並未更改原有立法原意。</p>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓十五日電〕衆院撥款委員會十五日否決國務部之五百萬元請求。該款項中大部份係用於有關該部與中國之農業，科學及學生交換計劃。</p>
<h3>處理美物資會後日午夜結束　五市配糧仍繼續實施</h3>
<p>史蒂爾曼調查團明由滬出發</p>
<p>〔中央社南京十穴日電〕依照中美救濟協定，我政院處理美國物炎委會，定十九日下午十二時任務終了。嗣後一切有關美國救濟物資之處理工作，將一併移歸政院美援運用委會辦理。至處理美國物資委會所經辦之五大都市配售糧食計劃，今後仍繼續實施。並擬擴大其配售範圍及地區。處理委會在結束前，決成文一財務委會，整理核算過去一切賬目。十六日上午該會曾與中華救濟團舉行第五次聯席會議，審查有關醫藥·衛生·農業·社會救濟等補助款項之分配案件，賴普漢亦被邀列席。</p>
<p>〔本報南京十六日電〕美援運用委會聯絡專員嚴家淦十六日下午乘機飛滬，將於十八日自滬與史蒂爾曼調查團赴鄂·湘·粵·台等地實地調查。</p>
<h3>立院外委會會議王外長報告外交</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十六日電〕立法院外交委會，十六日下午三時半開秘密會議，出席委員七十餘人，張道行主持，王外畏應邀偕亞東司長黃正銘，美洲司幫辦陳世材到會？就外交問題提出較具體翔實之報告，繼由各委員發表意見，至晚七時始散。據悉：王氏曾强調中美邦交必須繼續敦睦，使陰謀破壞者無計得逞。對蘇外交雖條約義務我必信守，然決負重交涉仍待解決之問題。王氏並謂，蘇聯容或予各國共黨若干支援，然必不致立即引起國際戰爭之程度，對日問題，我應得賠償，自應堅持，而和約簽訂後之管制，尤爲我國注重，決不退失立塲。此外，美援及聯合國諸問題，王氏亦均有所闡述。</p>
<h3>王雲五報告下半年財政</h3>
<p>整頓稅收辦法擬就</p>
<p>〔本報南京十六日電〕立院財政金融委會，十六日下午舉行秘密會議，聽取政府財政報告，該會由召集人劉振東主席，到立委鄧飛黃·江一平·崔敬伯等百餘人。財長王雲五，財次徐俾　均應邀蒞會，由王雲五報告當前財政歷一小時，王報告坦白而切實，對當前財政實施剖析甚詳，報告中可分爲二部，一爲目前國家收入實况，一爲平衡收支計劃，王首謂，上半年之稅收爲四十五萬億至五十萬億元，下半年稅收之預算約爲三百萬億，全部財政收入預算可望達五百四十餘萬億元（請參閱十六日本報第一版）。至支出預算，現正由主計部編制中，下半年之財政，普通收支可望平衡，至特別支出則須另行設法，下半年之支出，除普通政務費外，以公務員及士兵武官待遇及戡亂費爲數大，當設法使收支逐漸接近平衡，現計劃以下列四種方式增加收入，（一）增闢稅源，整頓稅收。（二）利用美援。（三）出售救濟物資。（四）出售敵偽物資。關於增闢稅源，整頓稅收辦法，現正擬訂中，即將提請立院完成立法程序後施行。關於征收財產稅問題，財部原則上極爲贊成，惟技術尚待研究。至動用國人在外存款，我國過去已數度與存款國家交涉，但外國多根據其銀行法，不願提出存款人名單，故現尚無良好辦法可以動用。王氏報告中，並提及當前外匯政策，謂兪鴻鈞已有相當改進，財部今後將與央行密切合作。王報告畢，吳望伋等十餘人曾提出建議與質詢，均經王予以等復，至七時始行散會。</p>
<p>〔本報南京十六日電〕整頓稅收增闢稅源計劃，財部已擬就，即將送呈立院，完成立法程序，於日內開始實行。計劃中對於關·鹽·貨物及直接四稅，均定有改進辦法，茲探悉如下：（一）關稅將改定稅則，提高稅率，除有互惠條約之限制，不能改定者外，餘均酌量增加。（二）鹽稅在不妨礙平民負担原則下，略予提高稅率。（三）貨物稅，過去征稅之基礎，係以兩月前之貨價爲課稅標準，今後將改爲以一月前之貨價爲征收基礎。（四）直接稅儘量設法剔除中飽。</p>
<h3>立院國防委會秘密會　何顧親報告軍事　戡亂軍事半年內將有顯著進展</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十六日電〕立法院國防委會，十六日下午開秘密會議，聽取政府軍事報告，出席委員百餘人，召集人曾擴情主席，何應欽，顧祝同均出席，何氏先報告戡亂勦匪方針後，顧氏繼續報告我·匪實力消長，今後戰略方針，最後由國防部第三廳長羅澤閩報告目前態勢。何·顧報告重心，除就翁文灝施政方針中軍事部份重加解釋外，對戡亂前途具有樂觀信心，相信在二三年內，即可告一段落。最近半年內，戡亂軍事必有顯著進展，現正集中兵力，採取積極主動戰略，首求肅淸華中戰塲，黃河以南匪軍，再肅淸河北，然後收復東北失地，並運用機動戰術，對於重要之據點決先求點與點之聯繫。何·顧均特別張　提高士氣，改善士兵待遇及建立地方武力之重要，而實行總體戰，亦為今後當務之急。顧報告時，承認匪軍較日本投降時已增强，匪現有正規軍一百餘萬民兵九十餘萬，國軍實力之增加，則倍於匪軍，現有正規軍五百廿餘萬，羅澤閩報告敵我能勢時，表示山東戰局決可無虞，　州決可確保。何·顧等報告畢，委員十餘人提出建議及質詢，對目前戰局至表關心，對徵兵制度亦頗不滿，主改募兵制，均經何·顧等分別答覆。</p>

<h3>青年黨致函翁文灝　聲明不參加政院　另函陳雷兩氏說明原委</h3>
<p>〔本市訊〕靑年黨以立委問題延未解決，爲貫澈前言，已決定不參加行政院，司法·考試兩院亦不擬提名參加。該黨中常會十六日上午開會作此決定後，當即致電翁院長，請迅另行物色兩部長，兩政委人選，以免政務虛縣。同時函陳布雷，雷震兩氏，說明原委。</p>
<h3>國民黨某氏談話</h3>
<p>總裁盼青年黨參加政府</p>
<p>〔中央社南京十六日電〕記者頃爲靑年黨陳啓天·左舜生等四人致函行政院翁院長，表示其不能參加政府一事，訪問中國國民黨中熟悉靑年黨參加政府問題之某氏，詢其對此事之意見，承答覆如下：「據余所知，陳·左等四人致翁院長函，此時尚未到京，吾人只見披露該函之新聞稿，青年黨負責人士仍以立委名額問題未能解決爲理由，而表示不參加政府，吾人實不能理解，如因此而竟使靑年黨與本黨自抗戰開始以來之合作發生影響，尤可惋惜，蓋（一）以法理而言，立委自應以得票較多者當選，然本黨中央負責人士仍爲靑年黨當選立委未能達到預期名額，屢表歉憾，並正在淸理與事實兼顧之下力謀補救，本黨重視靑年黨之合作，由此已可槪見。（二）以政黨政治而言，立法院中之少數黨地位，原不以名額究有多少爲衡，然本黨中央正在力求友黨人數之增加，此項工作需要時間，殊不料友黨人士對此不予體諒。（三）吾人以爲靑年滅人士參加行政院共策國家大計之進行，即可增進兩黨之合作，而有助於立委問題之解決。今靑年黨竟堅持立委名額問題，爲其參加行政院之前提，使兩個不同之問題混爲一談，是徒增加問題解決之困難而已」．最後，某氏並告記者稱：蔣總統正擬延攬靑年黨人士任考試院副院長，並請該黨提荐大法官及考試委員，余深信蔣總裁及本黨中央決不輕易放棄對靑年黨之希望，甚盼靑年黨毅然打開僵局，參加政府。本于互諒互信之精神，與本黨精誠相見，使過去合作救國之初衷得以貫澈，當此行憲時期，無論如何，應將國家利益置於黨的利益之上也。</p>
<h3>行使職權第一聲　物價暴漲不應漠視　監院提出糾正案　請政府迅採緊急措置</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十六日電〕行憲第一屆監察院監察委員，十六日首次行使其職權，運用糾正權，向政院當局提出糾正案，該案案由稱：「近日物價暴漲，未見政府採取有效措置，應予糾正案。」爲委員權少文，陳連元，郭昌鶴，柴峯等三十一人在十六日晨舉行之第三次會議中所提之臨時動議，經院長於會中提出後，立即獲致全體委員之同意，決定以大會之名義提出，於十六日午後即送行政院。該案提出時，已屆散會時間，即已超過十二點鐘。經秘書處將全文宣讀後，部份委員認爲在文字上應有所硏討，主張成立審查會，予以審查，再提交十七日之大會中通過者。亦有人提議已屆散會時間，應徵求延長時期之意見，然後討論。此時復有委員，以極沉重之語調稱：全知若干人必以已至吃飯時間而急於散會，但要知吾人係代表多少萬人來行使職權者，不能爲個人之吃飯問題而貽誤多數人的沒有飯吃！另有人主張此事極爲重要，應無限制延長時間。旋復有人提出應以大會名義提出，抑以提案人名義提出爲討論，惟經若干人發言，一致認爲已經全體委員之同意，應以大會名義提出，而在糾正案提出時，已有三十餘人之連署，依法不必再付審查，當獲一致通過。茲誌該案所特理由如次：「近來物價上漲，如火如荼，影響所及，舉國惶惑，値茲動員戡亂時期，安定民生至關重要，邇行政當局對此迄在漠視，未見採取適當對策，甚至若千舉措反足以助長物價上漲，例如：（一）國家銀行貸款之放任及放款利息之提高；（二）國營事業之領導漲價；（三）對於幣制改革問題，有關當局屢次發表不負責任之言論，影響人民對於法幣之信心，馴致幣値日貶，物價逐高。此種情形長此放任，勢必動搖國本，同人等認爲有移請政府迅採緊急措置之必要，特依法提出糾正案，敬請公決。」</p>
<p>監察法起草完畢　提今第四次院會討論</p>
<p>〔本報南京十六日電〕監院於十六日晨九時半舉行第三次會議，于右任主席。本日討論之案件爲：（一）監察法草案，（二）各委員會組織法草案。第一案已大體討論完畢，再組起草委會於十六日午後開會，詳加硏討後，提出於十七日晨舉行之第四次會議中逐條討論。第二案則作大體討論後，以已屆散會時間，其起草與審查工作則俟監察法起草完成後再予進行。</p>
<p>按監察法內容共包括同意·彈劾·糾舉·糾正各權之行使程序，全案共分六章，計第一章總則，第二章同意權，第三章彈劾權，第四章糾舉權，第五章糾正權，第六章附則。共計卅二條。主席宣佈開始討論後，即由各委員陸續發言，大都集中於對本身職權之加强。在各委員會組織法一案之討論時，多數表示各委員會之用人太多，近於浪費，不必予以硬性規定。至各委員會之設立，則應視政院各部會之性質而設立。張定華稱應另設一委員會以針對司法考試兩院，否則兩院如有違法失職即無從考察。王冠吾主張增加糧食委員會，而軍事委會則應改爲國防委員會，因國防可包括軍事。大體討論，至此完畢。</p>
<p>監院監察法起草委會於十穴日下午三時半開會，出席委員卅九人，呂超主席，逐條按照　委會所擬草案予以討論，因若干字句之變更即將影響監院之職權，故討論時極爲愼重，其中討論較久且出入較多者，有如次數點：（一）第二條中監院行使監察職權時，原草案係規定由監院派員調查，現經修正提高調查權，得由監察委員持檢查證或由監院監委行署派員特調查證即可赴各機關，公共團體調查工作。（二）第二章同意權部份，若干人主張全部删去另行草擬辦法，但有人提出同意權乃監察權之一種，不應另列。旋仍決定不予另列，惟在條文上有所修正，原第八條删去，第九條改爲「總統提名之司法院長副院長，考試院長副院長，及司法院大法官，考試院考試委員時，應檢附　歷，並加具意見，以備審查，監院如不同意時，應以書面請總統另行提名。」（三）第三章彈劾權部份，對彈劾案之進行規定甚詳，其中對彈劾案之提出，有硬性規定。審查會舉行直至晚八時半始散，此項草案即提十七日晨第四次會議討論。</p>

<h3>國際軍事制度的調整</h3>
<p>二憲政府組織成立以後，有開開防軍事行政，在人事上制度上，均有新的改變。人事方面，由何應欽將軍出長國防部，顧祝同將軍繼任參謀總長，其他各地的剿總人事，也隨着新形勢而有新的調整。制度方面，重新確立國防軍事制度，修正國防部組織法。據行政院翁院長十五日答覆立法院的質問，關於軍事行政的改革，他說：國防部修正組織法的基本原則，已由總統核定，其中規定「國防部長負軍事政策及行政責任，參謀總長爲統帥之幕僚長及國防部長之行政官，負軍事業務之計劃與指導責任。」「參謀總長對軍令事宜，以奉總統之命令行之，對軍政事宜，以部長命令行之，成以奉部長諭行之。」這就是新的國防軍事制度的輪廓，無疑的，它和舊的國防部組織，在本質上和指揮系統上，已經有了根本變異。預料修正後的組織法，將較易獲得立法院的通過，事實上，這個新的國防軍事制度，比較舊的形式要合理，要完美。</p>
<p>國防部是一國軍事細胞的總神經，並且是指揮機構的中樞。軍事的動作靠指揮，而指揮的靈活靠智慧；智慧並非發自一人，乃係發軔於多數的智囊和經驗家，最後抉擇一點以指揮運用之，則繫於一人。國防部掌管軍政和軍令，如一人之有兩臂，如飛鳥之有兩翼；軍政和軍令必須要分工，特別是要求智慧上分工，但它們循行的計劃，和頒行的指揮令，則是由最高統帥最後抉擇的。世界各國戰時的中央首腦部，和我國織時政府電事系統，部是如此的。我國前年設立的國防部，在行政方面，它是戰時軍事委員會的縮小；在制度方面，則是奮軍政軍令大權於一人，因之國防部的組織，部長無實權，軍政軍令大總完全操在參謀總長一人之手。總長下設陸·空·海及聯勤四個總司令部，總長直接向國府主席負責，於是所謂國防部長等於總長的行政院代表而已。這個制度的特色原在陸海空軍指揮統一，前方作戰與後方勤務由一人統籌處理，有「集中一點」之優，不虞脫節，不感匱乏。但同時它的缺點也很多：權力過大，容易專斷，旣不向行政院負責，又不向立法院負責，除元首一人而外，無人能加控制。這個軍事權力高於一切的制度，似乎並世各國從未使用，我國舊立法院不通過國防部組織法，多次警告，指出這個制度的危險性。但這個制度終於試騐了兩年，現在方作歷史的結束。</p>
<p>這次國防部的改組，人事上的配備，部長由何應欽將軍擔任，他是軍人的先進，抗戰時期指揮軍政軍令兩系統，豪無偏頗。參謀總長顧祝同將軍，則是一個誠篤穩健的戰略家。在制度方面，這次國防軍事制度的調整，是集多數的智慧於神經中樞，以軍政軍令的分工，作總統兼統帥的扶擇和指揮。它與舊制度的不同點有三：（一）新的國防部，國防部長的權力已相當提高，他在軍事政策及軍事行政上，指揮參謀總長。部長對行政院負責，總長對部長負責；（二）國防部長是政務會讓的一員，因而行政院可以透過部長，控制軍政部份。至於軍令動作，關係國防機密，則不歸行政院控個，而由總統直接指揮；（三）參謀論長的地位是技術的智慧的，在軍令方面，他是統帥的慕僚畏，替總統設計指揮三軍；在軍政方面，他是部長的行政實，替部長規劃業務與執行業務。</p>
<p>根據以上這三點看來，參謀總長的權力是縮小了，處理軍政的大權交給了國防部長，作戰的指揮權歸屬了總統。參謀總長所執行的軍政軍令，避免了專斷，避免了集權，他是奉命奉論辦理的一個幕僚長，而非有權發揮獨立意志的主管長官。從學理上事實上說，這次國防軍呈制度的調整，是比較合理的；尤其是戡亂軍事萬分緊張的現階段，這次的調整，是比較完美的。</p>
<p>軍事系統是講求效果的，指揮作戰是講求時機的；要之，優良效果的獲得，和有利時機的爭取，實與天時，地利，人和三個因素，互有深切的關係。說天時，現階段的國防軍事制度，是合乎潮流與事實的；說地利，軍事制度調整以後，必然繼之的是戰略的調整，今天的主戰塲在中原和華北，戰略的重新配備，軍事首腦部必心有成竹；說人事，何顧兩位將軍的情感融洽，對於各地剿總的指揮，軍事人才的使用與安排，以及地方武力的扶植，當可望其有進步的揹施。基於這個見地，我們對於今後軍事上的效果，作戰上的時機，抱着樂觀的態度，期待着新國防部。</p>
<h3>道在尿溺　胡先文稱：研究楊妹應先探討排洩物</h3>
<p>〔本報重慶十六日電〕主持楊妹考騐工作之胡先文院長，今對楊妹問題發表精闢見解，渠稱：社會上僅注意楊妹不食，而忽視楊妹廿一日來小便之奇少，歷史上曾有絕食專家，但楊妹在最後考騐之十日中，宋有點滴小便者，則屬罕聞。常人每日至少小便五百CC，否則必將中毒，而小便亦絕不可能强迫不解。伊之排洩物究藏何處，迄今大惑不解，殊堪重視，故不論楊妹不食是眞是假，是長期抑是短期，在眞相未明前，伊少解小便之現象，即足供科學家硏究探討。</p>

<h3>發展粵糖業　較臺糖更有希望</h3>
<p>資委會洗子恩談稱</p>
<p>〔中央社台北十六日電〕炎委會前擬與粤省府合作發展粤省糖業拆遷台灣廢置糖廠赴粤事，現計劃拆遷兩個糖廠：一爲花蓮廠，一爲台中第二廠，前者每日壓榨甘蔗能力一干噸，後者五百五十噸，惟因兩廠皆於戰時遭受破壞，尤以台中廠爲最，毀壞及失散機件達三分之二，必須整理及修配，此項工作頗爲不易，同時機器亦嫌過舊，據資委會派來台灣調查此兩廠之洗子恩稱：「依經濟觀點而言，拆遷此兩破廠，並予修配機件所需之款項，恐較另建新廠爲多，並不合算。」因此將來是否拆遷，尚須俟渠飛粤洽商後始可決定。洗子恩又稱：粤省種蔗十二個月即可長成，合省需十六個月，地域條件較台省爲優，成本較台省爲低，前途希望甚大。</p>

<h3>蘇聯致英政府照會　反對西德設政府　西德幣制改革商獲成議</h3>
<p>〔聯合社倫敦十六日電〕蘇聯大使館發言人今日宣稱：蘇聯已照會英國，謂對於倫敦六國協定決議單獨設立西德政府一節，碍難接受，並認爲該項協定遠反波茨坦公約。此事係由蘇聯駐英大使柴魯平於六月七日通知倫敦六國會議主席斯屈朗，是爲蘇聯反對六國協定之初次正式聲明。但莫斯科電台與蘇聯各報在六國會議開會時，即已表祘蘇政府不能接受六國協定，故此次舉動實在意料之中。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社柏林十六日電〕此問謠傳極盛謂蘇聯與美當局現正在商討有關德國四佔區是否有共同實行貨幣改革之可能性問題，美官員業已自法朗克福來此間會商此事。</p>
<p>〔路透社佛朗克福十五日電〕英美法三國軍政府首長暨其財政顧問，今夜舉行重要會談，歷時三小時許，所談殆爲幣制改革問題。此間相信西德三區已準備進行其經濟與財政合併計劃。美軍長官克萊於今日之會談後雖拒絕討論談話內容，但明白表示已無再就今日會談之題目，與法軍長官寇尼許繼續會談之必要。克萊表示渠尚不知法國國民議會就倫敦會議建議辯論的結果，但曰法國議會不論有何決議，均不致影響三國軍政府首長今日所成立的決議。詢以已否將實施幣制改革之日期告知德國官員，答曰未曾。復詢以是否擬接受德人之意見，於實施幣制改革之際同時實施稅制改革，答曰德人此項意見頗覺適宜，但實施之際尚須視不可預見的因素而定。克萊並聲明今日三軍政府首長之會談，並未涉及政府問題。公報不久可在佛朗克福發表。渠又曰，美方擬與法方於週三在柏林舉行另一問題之會談。</p>
<h3>法國會代表決西德協定　政府以去就力爭　美英不接受法所提建議</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕倫敦十六日廣播：巴黎訊，法閣今日舉行四小時會議，決定不視國會中對六國協定表決之結果爲正式之信任票或不信任票，惟如國民議會有不信任表示，則內閣決定解職。</p>
<p>〔合眾社巴黎十六日電〕議會辯論於上星期五開始，將於下午三時半恢復。左右兩派大舉批評政府時，許曼及皮杜爾均將一一招架。大多數反政府人士要求重開六國對德會議，爲在最後關頭爭取英美首肯起見，法外部秘書長旭凡爾十五日泰半時間在倫敦與英美官員會談，然據可靠消息，倫敦及華府均未接受法國之要求。</p>
<p>傳許曼正準備於議會十六日晚投票後，將內閣辭呈提交歐禮和總統，並已完成新內閣名單，以便一併呈遞。謠傳退出內閣諸部長中，皮杜爾亦在內，然其後政府發言人加以堅決否認。</p>
<p>〔路透社巴黎十五日電〕皮杜爾今日向國民議會之致辭，並朱能打開政府在議會中所面臨的僵局，社會黨內部關於倫敦決議之意見尚有分歧，戴高樂之猛烈抨擊，對於國民議會之辯論顯然有重大影響，而英美之犧牲法國支援德國，尤爲一般法人所關切。社會黨猶盼貝文將以支持法國之建議，同意擴大對魯爾之管制，至於由六國共管魯爾工業之經營，不僅以管理其工業產品之分配爲限。</p>

<h3>下月召開多瑙河會議　蘇聯接受美建議　奧地利得以觀察員</h3>
<p>〔路透社華盛頓十五日電〕國務部透露：蘇聯築已同意於七月三十日召開多瑙河會議。蘇駐華大使館昨向美政府提出之照會，除聲明前意外，復同意邀請奧國以觀察員身份列席會議，得提供意見而無表決之權。蘇照會同時聲明，關於開會地點定在貝爾格勒之點，由於南斯拉夫政府不及籌備於是日召集此一會議之般備，故不能由蘇聯接受，而建議在其他多瑙河沿岸某國之國都舉行。</p>
<p>蘇聯之照會並同意美國之建議，召開多瑙河會議之請柬應由四强出面。蘇聯此一照會係爲答覆五月廿六日美國提出之建議，要求使去歲十二月外長會議決定召集多瑙河會議之決議付諸實施。外長會議決定多瑙河會議者應爲外長會議之四强代表，及多瑙河諸國蘇聯·烏克蘭·保南捷羅及奧地利。以對奧和約尚未成立，故奧國之參加，遂成蘇聯與西方强國間爭執點之一。按蘇聯之同意與美國討論馬歇爾所謂之「特定問題」之一，尚係美蘇於數星期前從事外交戰以來之第一次。美國之向蘇建議實施外長會議決議以召開多瑙河會議，適在美蘇外交戰發動後之數日，當時即有人相信美國此舉，意在先就次要問題發動恢復對蘇談判，以試探蘇聯是否具有和平解決一切問題之誠意。</p>
<h3>防止共產主義發展　厥在經濟援助亞洲</h3>
<p>〔中央社倫敦十五日電〕「曼哲斯特衛報」今日社論亞洲共產主義之擴展及其與世界其他部份之關係，認爲共產主義現正在亞洲大多數國家尤其如緬甸，錫蘭，印尼，越南，及馬來亞等地獲得發展，但如共產主義欲掌握整個亞洲，則先須在中國及印度獲得優勢。然中國國民然目前地位並不如一般所認之嚴重，國民黨旣致力於保衛中國傳統，故其已獲有甚大之支持力量。該報繼稱：倘印度或中國或兩者均落入共黨之控制，則全世界政治及經濟組織將爲之一變。但西方世界必不願亞洲蘇維埃化，阻止此事之方法，厥在仿效馬歇爾援歐計劃之方針，予亞洲經濟援助，以挽救某種最壞之經濟局勢。</p>
<h3>美英促北歐三國締結聯盟防侵略</h3>
<p>〔聯合社倫敦十五日電〕瑞典消息靈通人士今日稱，美英兩國已促瑞典參加斯坎的那維亞半島聯防。瑞典已表示挪威與丹麥任何區城聯防，備奧英法比荷盧五國聯防結合，瑞典不願參加，以免觸怒蘇聯，且瑞典無從獲得軍事援助。挪威與丹麥不信西方與東方一旦發生戰爭，斯坎的那維亞半島能保守中立，希望與西歐聯防維繫。</p>
<p>〔路透社斯德哥爾摩十五日電〕締給斯坎的那維亞軍事同盟之主張，最近已獲有更多人之支援。瑞典之軍事專家於詳細研究之下，相信此一同盟將爲避免斯坎的那維亞區被侵略之重大因素。彼等並信瑞挪丹三國間之軍事合作，更可獲得如下之利益：就地理上言，斯坎的那維亞軍事集團自丹麥德國海岸，以迄擲威極北之伐倫格灣，海岸綫全長二千二百公里，其深度自瑞典波特尼亞灣內之宋治伐爾迄挪威海岸之特隆特亨，計四百公里，自斯德哥爾摩迄貝爾根計八百公里，在此區域內港灣曲折，全境又多山林，對於外界之侵入者殊爲不利。設或發生侵酪，決不能一鼓而下，勢須盡數月之功，始能有所建樹。在此期內，外界對斯坎的那維亞之援助，必已能抵達斯坎的那維亞。（二）專家估計斯坎的那維亞集團之防軍實力總計一百萬人，包括戰時具有地下運動經騐之丹挪民團在內。至於瑞典軍武器之精良，在歐洲亦僅次於蘇聯與英國。（三）三國空軍共有飛機約一千架，海軍共有軍艦約一百五十艘。（四）在工業與供給方面，斯坎的那維亞集團之聯合力量，在歐洲亦擠於首席地位，瑞典之著名鋼鐵廠及兵工廠，三國之造船所，丹麥之自動輕型武器，及挪威所產製原子彈所需之重水，均爲强大的戰爭潛力。（五）海岸綫之迢長及港灣之優良，便於原料戰具之輸入，不易爲敵方切斷。就戰略上言，三國之聯防，使瑞典對外交通不易被切斷，挪丹兩國之間祗要有一國未被敵方佔領，瑞典即可使其對西之交通綫保持開放。軍事專家並指出瑞典東部之波特尼亞灣，雖爲斯坎的那維亞之軟腹，但若以芬蘭爲基地而向該處進攻，需要大批船舶之集中，比較匪易。自波羅的海方而之進攻，將首先遭遇哥德蘭島之阻礙，亦能具有相當的拖延效力。比較最危險者，尚爲瑞典東岸工業區之易受來自東方之空襲，及可能自丹麥渡海向瑞典南部之登陸進攻。就前者言，東岸之空防必須大事增强，就後者言，則三國軍事同盟之締結，可使瑞典及挪威得先在丹麥境內設置基地，以抗來自歐陸方面之敵人。</p>

<h3>美參院通過援外案　對削減數額大部份恢復　眾院撥欵會主席表反對</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕紐約十六日廣播：華盛頓訊：美衆院撥款委會主席泰勃本日告衆院謂：削减援外基金，實屬合理，該項基金如能善予運用，已能生效。渠對參院所持恢復援外基金十一億七千五百萬萬元一點，將力予反對。</p>
<p>〔合眾社華盛頓十六日電〕參院十六日晨以六〇票對九票通過六·一二五·七一〇·二二八美元援外法案，該案業已移送衆院，以便在休會前之會議中得以決定。參院以六十四對十五票通過參院撥款委員會之修正案，恢復被衆院削减之二·一六〇·〇〇〇·〇〇〇美元之大部，同時，衆院通過延長基金之使用期爲十五個月，亦被取消，而恢復行政當局建議之十二個月。上項法案，已移送兩院聯席會議委員會，該會預定於本日下午開始工作，以矯正兩院間之差異。</p>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓十六日電〕參院經長期辯論後，表決增撥援外經費，並將該案交還衆院討論，預料將遭眾院反對。參院批准之援外經費，無論在遠東與歐洲方面，增加頗巨，一部份由於提高衆院批准之數至六·一二五·七一〇·二二八元，而大部份則因規定供給十二個月之用所致。據參院撥款委員會主席白里奇宣稱：該會表決援外經費數目極端慷慨，此次撥款乃對美國方面信仰之一種冒險舉動。</p>

<h3>汽油恐慌變本加厲　黑市供應不缺·價格高達百萬　軋油車輛編延里許　兩綫公共汽車停駛</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕油荒問題之嚴重，近日來已變本加厲。雖油價方告調整，及鄰近外灘一帶各加油站之加油時間重行規定，但排隊購油之汽東行列，仍有增無减，由晨迄晚，經常綿延里許，交通秩序大受影饗。據各加油站負責人稱，渠等每日平均供油量大致在九百加侖以下，故實際每處能購得汽油之車輛，每日決不會超過一百輛。以本市五十二個加油站計算，每日能得加油機會者不過五千輛，而本市機動車輛總數十數倍於此，因之如不寬放供油數量，擁塞紛擾情形將永遠無法改善。</p>
<p>購油行列中，營業性車輛最多，出差汽車及大卡車大都在午夜時分即開赴各加油站列隊鵠候，司機等均臥宿車上，故晨曦初露，汕站前早已停成長龍一條，後至者雖亦加入排隊，但油量有限，瞬息告罄，不僅浪費數小時時間，且當致進退兩難，狼狽不堪同時另一方面黑市汽油供應並不匱乏，唯價格高達每加侖百萬元以上，大部份購汕無着之車主，祗得忍痛仰給於黑市。事實上藉緊縮配額以求限制用油之目的已完全失去。聞本市存油數量頗豐，則該項大量黑市汽油究從何處流入？再本市每一營業車行之購油證，當局爲何不令其彙齊指定直接向油公司請配，以减少各加油站之擁擠。此二點在多數市民心頭，殆將成一大疑問。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕本市公共交通公司近以配件燃料供應困難，經呈奉市府核准，自今日起，將較短及次要之第七路及第二路甲綫，暫行停駛，一俟汽油供應正常，仍予恢復。該會已於上述兩路各站張貼佈告，俾免乘客空等。</p>
<h3>避免車輛擁塞　劃分加油地點</h3>
<p>車輛在加油站等候加油，各路交通大受阻碍，當局爲避免擁塞交通起見，對小客車與貨車加油地點加以劃分，自本月十八日起試辦。其劃分地點如下：（一）自用及營業小客車加油站：（亞細亞）中正東路四川路口，南京東路八五號及林森中路一二四四號三處。（美孚）四川中路一一一號，中正東路金陵西路口及林森中路寳慶路口三處。（德士古）河南路福州路一處。（二）貨車加油站：（亞細亞）北京西路大通路，長陽路六九二號及四川北路五九〇號三處。（美孚）四川北路一二〇二號，林森西路華山路口及平凉路楊樹浦路口三處。（德士古）西藏路一五七號。（三）其他各站，不分小客車與貨車均可加油。</p>

<p>昨日民調會繼續拋售食米三千石，並決定自今日起，每日拋售供應米三千石，星期一，三，五，在北市塲拋售，星期二，四，六，在南市塲拋售。加之銀根稍緊，無錫亦同時執行限價，經濟警察大批出動，監視市塲，各檔米價，一致回軟。南市塲邀守當局限價，均以九百八十萬元成交，北市塲則僅少數蕪秈有成交，其餘均無貨應市。昨日到貨甚稀，南北市塲共到二千八百四十八石。</p>
<p>據社會局糧食科長吉明齋表示：塲外交易已絕跡，當局對抑平米價狂漲，已具最大決心，如有超出當局限價，擅自抬高售價，以圖非法利潤者，查出後定予嚴厲處置。</p>

<h3>戰爭煽動者？　陳納德發表聲明　駁斥莫斯科電臺</h3>
<p>民用航空大隊總經理陳納德將軍，昨日上午十時在外灘十七號民航隊總部，招待本市中外記者，對合衆社倫敦十三日電指其爲「戰爭煽動者」一點，發表書面聲明，茲譯誌如下：</p>
<p>「最近莫斯科電台及共產黨無綫電評論員凱泰耶夫指責肯尼將軍李晋曼及本人爲戰爭煽動者，由於彼等經常以歪曲事實發佈虛僞消息爲慣技，故余對共黨之荒謬宣傳，原不欲予以注意，惟因余對促進世界和平，深爲關切，故余不能不向反共國家之人民有所表白，余知余之言詞，決不能在各共黨國家發表，因而余如欲向此等國家被奴役之人民表明立塲，實屬絕無可能。</p>
<p>余前被邀出席衆院外交委員會，陳述對於世界和平及援華之意見時，曾以大幅地圖，說明世界現已形成一小世界，一切事故凡在此一小世界中某一區域，發生影響時，必將在若干限度內影響其他各區域。余曾表示：如共產黨勢力，繼續在中國擴展，而蘇聯復不能遵守其於一九四五年與中國所訂之條約，則將不可避免地引起第三次世界大戰。余以此一地圖指出如蘇聯之侵略促成另一世界大戰，則若干區域，可能用作轟炸基地。</p>
<p>余雖會服役於兩次世界大戰，但余並非爲一軍事家。在兩次世界大戰中，余爲保持若干原則而奮鬥，此項原則。乃吾人政府建立的基礎。余深信人觀總有自由並認爲無論在國內或國際，全體人民皆應有安全之保障，爲保持此一原則，如有必要，余願再度參加戰爭。</p>
<p>余不信戰爭爲解決政治經濟問題之必要行動，戰爭絕難解決任何問題，無論此等問題屬於過去抑或屬於將來，戰爭之唯一必要性，僅在於制止彼企圖征服全世界奴役全人類之瘋狂野心者，歷史昭示吾人，過去有甚多此類人物，略舉其名，如威廉凱撒，希特勒，墨索里尼，東條英機等均是，歷史終將昭示吾人，史達林及其黨徒之全部紀錄，此乃在今日之世界中，唯一企圖以武力征服其他人民之集團。</p>
<p>戰爭煽動者，運用國家之全部資源，爲戰爭之準備，今日世界中之唯一戰爭煽動者，係居於克里姆宮之一羣人物，彼等盡其全部時間，研究赤化世界之途徑與方法，一切愛好和平之人士，將與余聯合一致，希望彼輩瘋狂人物，決不能發動彼等之大量陸空軍力量，向和平世界進攻云。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕交通大學校長程孝剛，對吳市長為六月五日學生反扶日遊行事件之第二次質詢，因市府催促早日答覆，昨已發出。其中數點需待繼續調查完畢後，再作答覆。程校長聲明學校處理此一事件之立塲，有與市府不同之處。渠引述古語譬喩學校之立場為一道之以德，齊之以禮」，而市府之立塲則爲「道之以政，齊之以刑」，故雙方意見不免有出入之處。渠不明何以市府猶一再對交大質詢，是日交大雖有部份畢生參加遊行，但因阻而未出校門。渠認爲如市長亦自他校進行調查，則眞相或較易明白。</p>

<h3>中央銀行派員飛赴平津阻止華北游資南流　金鈔黑市昨起已加緊取締</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕此次本市之物價漲風，金融當局已斷爲由於華北游資之作祟。因東北流通劵之收兌，使游資充斥華北；因華北上海間匯水之高，致華北游資以各種方式南下，估計每日達國幣一萬億以上。在此局勢之下，本市物價漲風空前，過去抽緊銀根拋售物價之萬應良藥，竟告失效。現悉當局爲對症下萬起見，決自阻止華北游資之南流着手。央行東北區專員王鍾已奉召來滬，報告東北華北金融情况。央行高級人員亦屢次會商，籌劃對策；並已決定先派李立俠夏晋熊玉鍾等日內飛赴平津，對現鈔携帶及匯兌，將施行嚴格之監視與限制，以期减少當地資金之南流。尚有若干計劃，一俟兪鴻鈞自京返滬後，亦將終續實施。本市取締金鈔黑市交易，昨日起執行已異常嚴格，犯者不問背景，一律嚴懲。食糧之管理，限價及拋售亦雙管齊下。加以首批美援物資，十八日即可抵達，市塲心理已感受影響，預料六月漲風，即將告一段落。</p>
<h3>實行限價交易後市上中上米絕跡　場外喊價仍在高檔盤旋</h3>
<p>米市昨起限價，市塲交易最高不得超過九百八十萬，門市不得逾一千萬，惟貨主以產地運滬成本均在限價之上，不能蝕本出售，故均不售，市上中上米絕跡，祗有次秈米以限價成交。北市塲白元高達一千〇八十萬元，陰元一千〇二十萬，較上日漲五十萬，市上亦有以陰元及早稻相搭出售者，早稻照限價，提高陰元價以補早稻價之不足。塲外價仍以無錫價已達一千一百四十萬，而喊高二三十萬。中等白粳一千〇五十萬，上白粳曾達一千一百萬元，未成交。薄稻高貨一千〇八十萬，交易極少。後因業外各物下降而較軟，到貨益减，二市爲六四八石。</p>
<h3>粉糧油餅下跌</h3>
<p>麺汾一瀉如往，良以各物均跌，貨主均相爭趁高先脫，况銀根稍緊，納胃頓弱。早開少數猶站高價，老車由三百五十一萬直落至三百三十一萬，兵船粉由二百四十五萬開市，後在賣風下降至三百三十萬元，各降二十萬元。建成紅蜂各降二十萬餘，麩皮降二十萬，小麥四百七十萬未動。</p>
<p>雜糧一致由高峯落下，黃豆降三十萬元。漢口乍豆最後五百六十萬元。菉豆銷呆，價跟低三四十萬，苞米售多於進，終降二十萬元。紅糧乏人問津，未開出，喊價低二三十萬。新蠶·新元麥·各降二三十萬元，沙赤一千〇五十萬，挫一百五十萬元。芝蘇降五十萬，生仁跌一百萬。</p>
<p>食油展開猛烈跌風，大有豆油初爲二千二百七十萬，收市退爲二千二百萬元，大昌新豆油二千一百九十萬，各計二百四十萬，低達一成之鉅。生油因存到均少，售戶不多，祗稍跌五十萬元。小車蔴油挫一百三十萬，生菜油落二百萬，豆餅在散戶頻吐下，降二十萬元。</p>
<h3>各地商情</h3>
<p>無錫　〔本報無錫十六日電〕物價漲風已告回挫，縣府繼續動員監視市塲，並在各米行門前飭派自衛隊武裝駐守，以防搶米。白粳做開一〇二六萬，白元一〇五〇萬，羊秈一〇三〇萬，粳稻四五五萬，小麥慘跌最烈，價見八百萬，白麥八二〇萬，麵粉三一一萬五千，荳油二一七〇萬，棉紗三億一九〇〇萬。</p>

<p>蘭州　〔本報蘭州十六日電〕蘭各行莊奉令緊縮，商貸頭寸告紫，暗息由十元挺至十五元，市塲購買力因之頓减。今晨市塲鬆懈，疋頭平均降二〇〇萬，紙烟每擔潟二十萬。</p>
<h3>茶市由高轉平</h3>
<p>昨日茶市，由漲轉平，其原因係受銀根緊，百物跌之關係，致人心渙散，執主漸感無力再抬，臨收結果，各呈原途盤旋之勢。交易則仍以內銷茶，在本街與鄉莊帮絡　收吸中，依然活躍不衰。至於外銷花色，因出口商態度趦趄，做開遂難明朗。</p>
<h3>食糖展開跌風</h3>
<p>昨糖市因有第三期特配糖出龍，於是發見難得之跌風。四半白因係特配糖之對象，現貨降至一千四百八十萬元，比前日收盤小三百萬元，其餘亦隨之轉降。現粗小八十六萬元，二四中砂白小八十萬元。</p>
<p>廿五期粗白初爲一千三百五十萬元，後爲四百十萬元，比前日收盤微緊。三期特配四半白共開出二萬八千五百五十包，價爲一千四百五十萬元，另加捐廿三萬元。同行劃出初爲一千四百七十萬元，後爲五百萬元。</p>
<p>土糖一致見軟，汕提靑叫價小八九十萬元，未成交。刁靑小四十萬元，興化白小百餘萬元。與赤降度相仿，棉赤無甚軒輊。</p>
<h3>特號綿白報價核售</h3>
<p>台糖公司昨舉行報價核售特號綿白糖後，各糖商及直接用戶前往申請者共五二五單位，計五萬二于一百包，經核准及格者二三三單位，共二萬八千五百五十包（每包一百廿斤）。價格每担一千四百五十萬元，因此特號綿白，昨晨市價已跌至每担一千五百廿萬元，最高峯會漲達一八〇〇萬元。</p>
<h3>行局修正內匯率</h3>
<p>四行兩局一庫內滙率，十七日起修正如次：厦門一二〇元，廣州一五〇元，汕頭一六〇元，海口一六〇元，梧州南寗各八〇元，長沙五〇元，武漢各交〇元，南昌三〇元，景德鎭五〇元，九江三五元，吉安四五元，贛州五〇元，重慶一〇元。</p>

<h3>利賣消息頻傳　紗布猛晉疾退　藍鳳細紗比上日跌八千萬元</h3>
<p>昨日棉紗市况，以連日狂漲，價站高峯，人心不安，加之同業銀根軋緊，浮多獲利吐售，客帮納胃轉呆。</p>
<p>晨開四十二支藍鳳細紗，因紗管會開配細紗較多，行情即告下瀉四五千萬元，嗣聞布市回降，本街納意懈怠，市盤再低至五億一千萬元結束，比上日回跌八千萬元。其他各支粗細紗亦均軋小三四千萬至八九千萬元不等。</p>
<p>昨日棉布市况，以銀根突呈緊迫，種種不利多頭消息紛傳，人心驟告虛怯。十二磅龍頭細布即告下挫四十萬元，嗣因本街及漢口山西天津等帮均來傾吐，市勢一路狂瀉至一千零廿五萬有賣出，迨近收時，以浮戶獲利抵補，回上至一千零四十萬元結束，較上日猛跌一百萬元。其餘中下檔細布細斜嗶嘰等，均見軋降，惟元布及士林布脚地尚堅挺。</p>
<h3>絲綢回低</h3>
<p>人造絲昨市上午挫降甚厲，下午止跌回升，卒比上日低降二千三百萬元，一二〇號金三馬有光，上午開盤五億九千二百萬元，一度升至九千六百萬元成交後，即告挫跌。中午收盤降至七千萬元，下午開盤再降至六千五百萬元，旋因各方乘低進補，行情又告冉冉上升，最大喊價曾到九千萬元，最後又降爲八千二百萬元。一二〇號斯尼亞C有光，比金三馬短去三千萬元左右。</p>
<p>廠絲昨市低回，C字等級成交價七億七千萬元，D字做開六千萬元，E字上午五千萬元有交易，均比上日價短去三千萬元之譜，高零祖與E字價相仿。干經昨市反告堅挺，因土絲昂貴，成本增高，惟乏成交，</p>
<p>綢貨昨市上午一致疲降，眞絲被面華强貨，上午開市三億〇二百萬元，一度升至即期〇五百萬元，後即告回跌，收市即期降爲二億九千二百萬元。格子壁縐日來客銷頗股，大誠單子昨市喊價與上日相仿，惟無做開。</p>

<h3>舊買脫手人心渙散　華股市況下游　公債突漲疊見新高價</h3>
<p>華股昨以失去圈外屛障，存多崩潰，瀉勢殊慘。除國貨新股漲停外，餘股莫不失利。國行停止放款，欲進又止。</p>
<p>晨初平定，永紗以三八八〇元登塲，自三八九〇元起，被賣到三八〇〇元。旋升爲三八三五元，代辦費開高爲三四元及三八元，銀根已緊，物價下跌，遂步下游，乃跌破三七〇〇元關，中途雖有小盤，無奈近午浮多潰散，更賣到三六五五元，午收爲三六六五元。除國貨新股始終漲停，餘股則信誼所跌不多外，其他一致慘降半成至一成不等。</p>
<p>後市永紗上塲三七〇〇元，先被賣到三六七五元，旋升爲三七八〇元，更退爲三七四五元，國行祗差進一千餘億，二一三號等均進，乃漲到三八〇〇元。聞國行停止放款訊，退至三七二五元收市。較晨收計信誼大通尚平，餘均微升，塲外各未上市股票除世界續挺外，餘均微回。</p>
<p>公債昨暴漲又起，新高峯再見，統丙自五七萬開後，漲達七五萬，最後在六〇萬關邊掙扎。較前收計甲乙丁戊各漲十萬〇五，統丙躍升十一萬五，成交約四百萬。</p>
<p>外股昨缺少業外推動，亦告下游，經警仍來監視，不免受阻，怡紗晨開六四〇萬，退至六一五萬，而後在六二〇萬光景盤旋，洋行帮買進，銀行帮及證券帮賣出，較前收計怡紗英聯會德豐怡啤航業跌半成，業廣紙版鋼業各低一成不到。</p>

<h3>拒乘中航飛機出國　闢世運代表團聲明</h3>
<p>第十四屆世界運動會將於七月底，在英倫開幕，我國代表團準備首途赴會。在國家政治經濟都很困難的今日，我國世運代表團能如期出國，參與大會，實在是値得慶幸的一件事。政府用心亦深良苦。</p>
<p>這次世運代表團出國，什麽都很好，祗是有一點太令人費解而感遺憾，那便是代表團出國不坐本國飛機，而坐外國飛機，代表幽主持人雖有聲明，但都是歪曲事實。</p>
<p>第一，該團所定座之美國西北航空公司，並沒有環球航綫。該公司航綫最西祇到上海，最東祗到紐約。論航程還不及中國航空公司的長，中航公司除中美綫外，尚有上海至印度的航綫。目前沒有任何一家航空公司能獨自包辦環球航綫。這次世遝團出國，事實上必須轉換幾家公司的飛機，不可能乘一家公司的飛機的。</p>
<p>第二點，該團發言人聲稱，我國飛機買自外國，即使坐中國公司的飛機，仍屬不够澈底。這顯然是將航空工業和航空運輸業，混爲一談。舉個淺近的例：法國和荷蘭在國際航空運輸業上是很活躍的。她們的法國航空公司（Air　Prance）及荷蘭皇家航空公司（KLM），辦理得很有成績，航綫遍全球，但事實上，兩大公司所用的飛機，也都是向美國賈來的，難道爲了這一點，法，荷兩國便不能有航空運輸業了麼？</p>
<p>中航公司這次準備優待世運代表團，但事實上中航公司由上海去美國的未來各班機座，均經售滿，所以如此力爭，也無非是爲了爭取國家體面，替國人爭一分光榮。現在該團拒絕搭乘中國航空公司飛機出國，個中當然有難言之隱。</p>
<p>至於說團員希望游覽紐約，中航公司已答應電請各地僑胞領館招待並籌備歡迎，中航公司與泛美公司爲兄弟公司，聯運及沿途招待上，絕不會比任何其他公司差。</p>
<p>定了座當然可以退，况且我世運代表團在某外國航空公司所定的是七月初旬由滬飛美舊金山的機座，距今還有二十多日，取消這些座位而換乘中航公司飛機，根本不生問題，問題在代表團願意興否而已。</p>
<p>記得一個故事，且拿牠來結束本文：某天鄰人向史密斯商借斧頭一把，史密斯告以斧頭不能借，因爲要留着切菜八事後史密斯夫人問道，你爲什麽用這個理由來拒絕人呢？史密斯說：你眞天眞啊，當你存心拒絕一件事情時，隨便舉一個理由便可以了，何必去費心硏究呢！（顧其行）</p>

<h3>談逐語索引</h3>
<p>— 葛召彤</p>
<p>逐語索引〔Concordance〕，又稱逐字索引，是紫引的最完備形式。「堪靠燈」一字在拉丁文上的原意本作「和諧」或「符合」解，待後逐漸演變作爲逐語索引解。逐語索引和一般的書後索引不同。普通書籍後面所附的索引都是要語索引。逐語索引是將書中所有的每一字或辭，用部首法，分筆法，或分類法排列，以簡明號碼標明其在原書中的出處，並附以原句以便檢查參考之用。例如燕京大學引得處的毛詩引得是一部極佳的逐語索引。我們要查詩經中的某句出於何頁何篇何章，祗須記得詩文中的一字即可撿得。如查「鐘鼓樂之」一句出於何頁何篇何章，我們依「鐘」字「樂」字或「之」字均可查得下列一條「鐘鼓樂之1/1/5」，即此句見於經文的第一頁第一篇第五章。</p>
<p>逐語索引最初多用於聖經方面，其後文學方面亦多採用。最早編纂聖經逐語索引的動機是因爲聖經中有很多部分，凡神所啓示者都彼此吻合而必須錄下以便對照之用。泊臼阿城的聖安爽納一般人皆認爲首先編纂逐語索引的人，但確切可考的逐語索引輛纂人實是胡主敎。他要注釋聖經而覺有編纂逐語索引的必要，因之便編成一本聖經逐語索引。聖經逐語索引對於經典學家，語文學家，歷史家，及宗敎士　讀聖經有極大的貢獻。</p>
<p>自聖經逐語索引出世後，學者紛紛以同樣方法編纂文學方面的逐語索引。迄今文學方面的逐語索引已編成的不少。從古代的樸羅潘脫司，浮琪兒，荷婁斯，以至雪萊，斯本薩，哥德，赫司立脫，盤痕斯，濟茲，吉伯秣，麥考萊，紐門等文學名著都已編有逐語索引。學者用之稱便。第一本莎士比亞逐語索引一七九〇年爲阿斯哥所編，克拉克夫人所編的標準本一八四五年出版於倫敦；一八九四年巴脫勒在紐約出版一本更佳的莎士比亞逐語索引。密爾登逐語索引一八五六年出版於馬德拉斯。坦尼生逐語索引一八七〇年出版於倫敦。費氏的但丁逐語牽引一八八九年出版於汲士敦。一八七二年倫敦喬叟學會出版喬叟逐語索引。一八七五年阿鮑脫出版坡普逐語索引。一八八七年湼維出版顧柏詩文逐語索引一九〇九年庫克出版葛婁逐語索引，一八九八年庇爾斯出版迭更斯逐語索引，一八九六年摩林紐克斯出版白浪寗逐語索引於紐約。作者所以列舉歐美各國所編纂的逐語索引要在證明歐美各國對於學術的資料是何等的重視，對於研究的方法是何等的細密。</p>
<p>我國學術界編纂逐語索引的工作剛在萌芽時期中。名著中輯爲逐語索引的祗有葉紹鈞的十三經索引，燕京大學引得處的周易引得，毛詩引得，春秋經傳引得，爾雅引得，孟子引得，論語引得，杜詩引得，（日人飯島忠夫和福田福一郞也編有杜詩索引，以一句末字爲之索引，爲用不宏），赫理顯的聖經類編（上海普益書會出版，凡聖經中同字的句文彙成一類，按照筆劃的多寡排列，爲之索引）等數種而已。燕京大學引得處尚有禮記引得一書，介乎要語索引與逐語索引之間，因原書中的虛宇或連繫等字概皆省略。听謂純粹的逐語索引對於虛字及連繫等字也應該排列的。觀此可知逐語索引的編纂工作在我國尚屬創舉，不但書籍的編爲逐語索引尚屬寥寥無幾，即學者認識逐語索引與利用逐語索引的也不多。這是因爲它在中國還是生疏的緣故。所以我們對於編製逐語索引和利用逐語索引方面應極力加以提倡，則學者方有機會以盡檢古今的要籍和窮究各科的內容。這對於學者節省治學時問與精力很多，而所得的利益也很大。</p>
<h3>原子轟擊與原子彈</h3>
<p>— 王乾德</p>
<p>John　K．Robertson原著　文聖常譯　世界書局印行</p>
<p>自從原子武器的發明，以及對原子能的工業應用不斷研究；人類對於原子能的注視就一天比一天的加重，也更加驚駭。新近美國原子輻射雲的發明，使得人生又多了一個死的恐懼。</p>
<p>然而這些原子炸彈，原子輻射，都是原子核以及中子（Nevtron）——一種不帶電的質點，它是構成原子核的中心分子——在那兒作祟，原子核像魔術家似的，一會兒變那樣，而一會兒又變成這樣，在這千變萬化的當中，就放出了所謂「原子能」（Atomic　Energy），這釋放的原子能也就不知殺害了多少的人羣，但相反的它也不知救活了多少的犧牲者，因爲要是沒有原子炸彈，恐怕第二次世界大戰，到今天還不會結束吧！</p>
<p>「原子轟擊與原子彈」原名Atomic　Artillery　and　the　Atomic　Bomb這本書是用通俗文字寫成，回答一般人提出的問題，在編排方面也有條不紊，一共分爲十四章，從最新的「物質是微粒組成的」一直講到「原子炸彈」，在可能避免的地方作者盡量的用普通的字眼去替代專門的言詞，而且在書中有時還能遇到一些引人的標題，這些都是使讀者發生興趣的妙法。</p>
<p>在原子彈爆炸的過程中，最甫要的當然是「原子射彈」所謂原子射彈也就正和普通炸彈中的火藥一般，要是沒有火藥，炸彈就不可能爆炸，同樣的在原子炸彈中要是沒有射彈的話，也不能解放膨大的原子能。</p>
<p>電子（Electron），是最輕的彈丸，也是發現最早的基本質點——因爲無論那一種元素的原子核的外圍都有電子在旋轉着，正像在太陽系中，地球繞着太陽而轉——但電子的質量太輕，而且當它穿過薄的金屬片時，不留下任何損害，所以它的不合需要，這些在第三章中介紹得很淸楚</p>
<p>第四章「一種較重的彈丸：正極綫」。先把正極綫的發現談了一下，再介紹到質子（Proto），質子雖不是一種很切合需要的質點，不過它和電子比起來就妙得多了。在這一章中講得最精彩的是「質量和能的互變」，也就是把愛因斯坦的定律引了一番，而舉了個例，這個例並不像一般深奧的學說，使人看了能很澈底的明白愛因斯坦定義的偉大意義；書中這樣的寫着「根據他的相對論所推出的定律（一）物體的能增加時它的質量也隨着增加。（二）每秘形式的能都相當一定質量」。這也就是E=MC2。此式中E代表能量，m代表物體的質量，C2代表光速的平方。這一章也是全書中最精彩的一章，因爲「相對論」是現代思潮的中心，正像以前牛頓萬有引力律一般，如果愛因斯坦方程式有一天能廣泛的應用的話，那人類的幸福就眞不淺了，正像書中所說「……那麽毀滅一盎斯的煤，所得到的能可供廿五萬人一年中所需要的電力」。</p>
<p>「沒有物質的質量」，這第六童的題目好像很奇怪，其實並不。只是介紹光子Pboton的文字，因爲「在自由的空間裏，有時也須將光視爲能力集中的小丸，即今日所謂光子，光子是個微粒，或放射的質點，它具有一定量的能，並以每秒186，000哩的速度（即光速）在空間裏進行。」</p>
<p>「製造轟擊原子的巨砲」，這是第八章的主題，芷像我們要把各種不同大小的子彈擊射出去，於是就得用各種不同的武器，像野戰砲，迫擊砲，長距離大砲等，同樣原子巨砲也有數種不同的形式，像范得拉夫（Van　deGroaff）靜電增速器及勞倫斯（Lawrence）敎授所發明的迴旋增速器（Cyclotron）這是二種極重要的工具，本書中對這二種工具有詳細的說明。</p>
<p>「核分裂與述鎖反應」，可以說是硏究原子彈中最重要的一頁，因爲假使核不能分裂的話，原子彈的成功無疑的是個幻想。再說要是連鎖不可能的話，換句話說也就是原子彈不能有這大的咸力，這是十三章的主題。</p>
<p>最後一章也就是第十四章，講的是「原子彈」，而且附帶的講到了一種新元素鎛，及關於這方面的製造廠，但這一章所講的材料並不多，因爲原子彈本身，根本就是一個軍事的秘密，而且美國政府限制發表，所以這當然不能說是本書的缺點</p>
<p>其餘像「宇宙綫」，「近代鍊金衛」，「原子核的構造」等等方面也讀了不少，而且更精彩的是附頁，這裏有許多名貴的照片，是普通的書籍中所難得找到的，印刷也相當淸楚。</p>
<p>所以凡是須要瞭解「原子時代」的眞相者，有一讀此書之必要。</p>
<h3>口頭英語活用百表</h3>
<p>— 朱方</p>
<p>Harold　E．Palmer著</p>
<p>張沛霖編譯</p>
<p>開明書店出版</p>
<p>在未介紹本書內容之前，我該把著者解釋「活用」之話，重說一遍：「把任何定句（Authentic　sentence）裏的任何詞語，換上文法結構相同而意義類似的別的詞語，便可以坩加無數新的句子，這種方法就呌做活用（Substitution）。」</p>
<p>本書就是根據這種方法編成表祗少能產一百以上的句子，最多的可達六七萬以至十餘萬句。所以要編這一種書，且須使每句多能適用，決非易事。</p>
<p>此外，編譯者還添加了一個「分課字彙」，一個「字彙索引」及一個「動詞表」，這對於自修的人，的確有相當的帮助。</p>
<p>假使用心地讀完了本書，在聽讀方面，一定會獲得很多的益處，因爲在每一個表前，都一個萬國音號的讀音表，並且他的注音不是個別的，而是以句中組織要素爲原則的，對於每句讀音的（Linking）及快讀時的消滅也多註出。</p>
<p>如果要在聽講上求進步的學生，我勸他趕快買來一讀，在目前，這是一本不可多得的書。</p>
<h3>讀「基本教會」</h3>
<p>— 而立</p>
<p>聯合國文教組織編　王承緒譯　商務出版</p>
<p>本書上册於去年九月出版，正値南京舉行遠東區基本教育會議，下册於本年三月出版，這一部世界基本敎育運動中的經典，國人因此得窺全豹。這部書可以說是集體的創作，執筆的是幾十位世界基本敎育方面的專家和學者，再由聯合國敎育科學文化組織的敎育組特設編輯委員會輯成本書。所以，在內容方面，充實一貫，値得細讀。</p>
<p>本書的最大價値，在讀者能從這兩本小小的册子中，讀到許多專家的文章，這些文章，在本書中大多是全部或大部分的保存原文編入。上冊關於各國基本教育現狀的記載，就是以有關各該國教育的專家的報告編入。例如，蘇聯的基本教育，執筆的就是那位出版過幾本關於蘇聯教育的專書的作者金夫人；法國殖民地的基本敎育，執筆的是法國政府殖民部的督學夏通先生；印度的基本敎育，執筆的是印度成人敎育雜誌主編崔特信先生；墨西哥的基本敎育，執筆的是在墨西哥鄉村敎育文化使者團工作的杜雷斯女士。至於下册的內容，更爲精彩。美國人類學家米特女士作基本敎育與文化價値一文，提出基本敎育應保存各民族文化的論題，並建議中國在世界敎育會議中應發揮中國自己對於敎育的觀點。英國倫敦大學敎育學副敎授黎德女士作基本敎育的目標一文，分折基本敎育上的幾個重要概念，提出基本敎育的一個哲學基礎，美國比較敎育專家康德耳敎授作識字以後一文，說明識字非基本敎育的最後目的，世界上很多侵略的罪行，都是所謂文化較前進的民族幹的。我國趙元任先生作中國語文敎學問題，分析語文敎學的內容，叙述白話文運動和文字改革的過去現在和未來，尤値國人一讀。世界語言學專家奧格登李加慈等，都有專文。這些專家的會集，是一般書籍所不及的。</p>
<p>本書的另一價値，在本書的材料都是一般關於敎育的書籍所不常見的。通常關於比較敎育的書籍，或是介紹國外敎育狀况的文字，大多是關於幾個大國如英，美，蘇，法等國的敎育，本書上册所叙述的許多國家，正與此相反。基本敎育，當然應該指每一個民族的基礎敎育，不過，本書所叙基本敎育的對象，乃是文化敎育比較落後的民族。夏通先生在本書下册提出敎育上的黑帶這個槪念，依他的看法，世界上敎育落後的國家，可以分成四個地帶，即遠東，中東，非洲和拉丁美洲是。本書上册所叙的國家，從美洲開始，叙到的有哥侖比亞，厄瓜多，瓜特馬拉，海地，宏多拉斯和墨西哥等國、繼述非洲的基本敎育，叙法屬西非和南非聯邦。提醒大家注意落後國家，當非他書可比。</p>
<h3>普式賡長詩　歐根·奧湼金</h3>
<p>— 頡頫</p>
<p>文學上的典型人物有兩種：一是綜合某一階層旣有人物而成的，如魯迅先生的阿Q，孔乙己。對於這種典型，作者往往就其旣有的缺點，而預言（指示）其將來應走的道路；像關於孔乙己，魯迅先生竹說：「沒有他，人們也便這麽過」，就暗示出一側舊知識份子必然走出帮閒的圈子—要使人們沒有了他，就不能「也便這麽過」。另一種典型人物是由作者觀察社會潮流的發展而創立的，像屠格湼夫「分與子」裘的巴扎羅夫和普式庚的歐根奧湼金。當普式庚這六千餘行長詩「歐根·奧湼金」初發表時，俄國貴族社會上並無奧湼金這種人物；因此而批評家們曾對他大肆攻擊。可是不久帝俄社會上就有了無數奧湼金。即在一百廿年後的中國，也正多這種人物。</p>
<p>在「歐根·奧湼金」這部詩體小說裏，詩和小說得到最和諧的結合，可說已達叙事詩的最高峯。它是蘇聯現有文藝的第一塊基石；它是一株深埋根鬚於俄國人民大　的茂樹。果戈理·屠格湼夫·托爾斯太·高爾基等都曾於這株樹下棲息過，而吸收詩　的芬芳。</p>
<p>「歐根·奧湼金」雖是這麽一部巨著，但它的情節並不太複雜。</p>
<p>主角歐根奧湼金是一個虛榮而驕傲的靑年貴族；由於他的優越感或是虛偽，他以漠然的態度將自己好的或壞的行爲全看成一樣。他的叔父以一紙遺囑招致他往一個鄉村裏去，在那裏他繼承了廣大的田莊與農奴。他被隣居們看成一個危險的傢伙，因爲他减低佃戶們的力役與自命不凡地逃避隣居們的拜訪。他只與隣居的另一個靑年貴族，詩人通斯基要好。一天，連斯基帶奧湼金往他未婚妻家裏去。他的未婚妻是一個「任何一本戀愛小說中都可看見的」女人，她有一個姊姊妲姬雅娜是一位高貴，蒼白宮有理想的少女，普式庚稱她爲「我的理想，俄國的靈魂」。她一見奧湼金之後，即刻就愛上了他。她寫信給奧湼金，說她將永屬於他。但這位平先浪漫成性的奧湼金，因爲驕傲或是看透了女人的欺騙，他以一塲道學氣的滿含優越感的訓話拒絕了她。於是她成天心神不寗，變得更其蒼白。</p>
<p>這時候連斯基正與他那位未婚妻打得火熱。一次他代他的岳家邀請奧湼金參加姐姬雅娜命名日的宴會。宴會的擾騷，妲姬雅娜因他而有的失指，在在都引起奧湼金的不滿。於是他對他朋友的邀請，突然覺得怨恨起來；於是他覺得他應該復仇。當跳舞一開始，他就死　住那位詩人的未婚妻，一直到舞會終了。這時候，詩人光火了；他覺得他要以手槍來決定他的命運——他要和奧湼金決鬥。於是，第二天，雙方在曠塲上各摸出槍來……而奧湼金打死了他的朋友。</p>
<p>詩人死後不久，他的未婚妻就和一位軍官結婚了。而她的姊姊妲姬雅娜，爲了失去妹妹的陪伴，爲了奧湼金因懺悔打死朋友而出外旅行，她更其憔悴了。於是，她母親帶她到莫斯科，那「未婚的姑娘的市塲」去，像貨品般地展覽她。果然，不久　就爲一位顯赫的將軍所賞識而娶了去</p>
<p>幾年之後，她在一個舞會上再看到了奧涅金，這時她已不復是一個鄉下少女，而是一位雍容華貴的少婦了。奧湼金開始瘋狂地追求她。屢次寫信給她，但全受了嚴勵的拒絕；如同奧湼金以前的拒絕她一樣。於是，奧湼金開始蒼白了，整個冬天他埋在屋子裏。當第二年的春天來的時候，他再去訪她，正是她流着淚在讀他以前給她的那些書信。原來她還是愛他的呵！但是爲了成全她丈夫的地位，爲了做一個賢妻良母，她還是犧牲了她的愛……</p>
<p>故事就此完結；但永不完結的是姐姬雅娜蒼白，坦朗而又光明的心與她偉大的犧牲精神。　（按此書呂熒譯希望赴版）</p>

<h3>二胡</h3>
<p>— 敦明</p>
<p>樓下有人在咿咿呀呀拉着二胡，不知怎樣我覺得二胡的聲音總是帶着無窮的疲倦和焦慮，和京胡的悽厲又是不同。劉天華製的二胡曲譜有「病中吟」和「餓馬搖鈴」之名，我想他是看透了二胡音色中苦悶的特徵的。</p>
<p>咿咿呀呀的聲音時斷時續，院中祗有一隻黑白相間的老貓半睜着眼睛聽着。它祗對冉冉飄下的楊花稍爲注意了一下，但一看並非可以吃的東西，就又懶懶地躺下了。</p>
<p>第一個把劉天華的名字告訴我的人是老沈，他不但拉得一手好二胡，而且還是出席過華北運動會的排球選手。可是他簡直就像是一位才從鄉下出來的農家子第，頭髮老是那麽蓬蓬的，身上的一件灰色大掛也老是那麼。扭的神氣，說起話來又是一口重濁的南京近郊的土話——要不說穿，誰都不會相信他是在全國最「洋化」的一所大學裏唸外國文學的。</p>
<p>同學們忙於出席敎授們家裏的社交茶會，到處學着可笑的牛津腔說英文，有的在房間裏捧起厚厚的大書時，嘴裏還「若有其事」的含着烟斗……但是，老沈却悠閑地拉着二胡，床上的被頭凌亂散置，偶然在被窩裏還　出一本莎士比亞全集的角來。敎授們在敎室中發問，老沈的回答總是遲緩的，重複的，錯誤百出——被窩裏的莎士比亞似乎除掉他他入夢之外，並沒有他什麽帮助。</p>
<p>於是，也在這樣一個楊花飛舞的時候，我們大考了。那一年的大老特別提早，因爲華北局勢緊張，北平的各大學就匆匆結束了這學期。</p>
<p>那一次，最難的一門功課是比較語言學，因爲有無數的「法則」非記住不可，而證明這些法則的例子又是從梵文起一直到北歐文和法文義文，都一定要記住幾「串」，拉丁當然更不必說了。我們一班的同學在這幾天差不多每人都書空咄咄，如痴如呆，儘在默唸「格林定律」第一條是怎樣，葉斯柏遜的解釋怎樣，白魯姆非爾德的修正又是怎樣，簡直睡在牀上時都會覺得天花板上儘是各種音標。</p>
<p>老沈還是在拉二胡，不過，不再拉整篇的曲譜了，有時拉了兩句就停下來。有人從對面房間的窗裏望他，原來他手裏雖然還拿着二胡，眼睛却瞪在筆記本上。</p>
<p>考試的那一天，題目竟意外地容易。考完出來，大家在校園裏比較着各人的答案，爭辯得很熱鬧，連監考的B敎授也笑着走來討論了。她說，他從沒有看見美國的學生這樣地認眞。談了半天，她突然指着一個人說。</p>
<p>「啊，我簡直認不出是你了你了，你不是一個運動員嗎？」</p>
<p>我們一回頭就看見了老沈，黝黑的臉瘦削不堪，眼睛紅紅的，簡直就像是一個患着重病的人！</p>
<p>他說身體不好，睡不着，沒精打菜地走了。</p>
<p>我剛回到宿舍，又聽到了那陣咿咿呀呀的聲音。我推門走進老沈的房間，他呆呆地向我點了一點頭，把拿二胡的手微微向桌子上指了一指。他露着牙齒，笑了。</p>
<p>桌子上是一本地·昆西的「吸食雅片者的自述」。</p>
<p>他看我滿面疑惑的神氣，哈哈大笑起來。他說：「沒辦法！我趕不上你們，這會連能不能及格都沒準兒！」</p>
<p>他連「開」了三全夜的「夜車」，精神不濟，就學了地·昆西！</p>
<p>我不禁對這位以「關門」著名北平的排球健將怔住了。可是他倒又笑了一笑，拉起「病中吟」來……</p>
<h3>無綫電傳影</h3>
<p>— 理初</p>
<p>不久的將來，學童們可以在自己家裏上學，總統競選人將在無綫電傳影播送室中競選，主婦們可從無綫電傳影中挑選衣物，然後在電話中成交，電影院將無人問津，無綫電將如秋扇之見捐——美國熟心無綫電傳影的人如是預言。</p>
<p>現在美國祗有廿七座無綫電傳影播送站（無綫電廣播電合共有一千六百座），祗有三十二萬五千架無綫電傳影機（無綫電收音機共有六千餘萬架），大半的無綫電傳影機是紐約居民所有。</p>
<p>但這新興的事業正在擴展中。據估計今年年底時美國可有一百萬架無綫電傳影機，六十座播送站，第一個美國兩岸無綫電傳影網在一九五〇年即可告成。如趨勢不變，則至一九五四年美國可有一千六百萬架無綫電傳影機和六千五百萬的用戶。</p>
<p>雖然無綫電傳影原理遠在十九世紀末即已發現，但第一架眞正的無綫電傳影機遲至一九三九年舉行紐約世界博覧會時才正式問世。（英國廣播公司用很多美國器材所造成的無綫電傳影機則在這三年前已完成。）接着大戰發生，這「科學玩具」被擱置了五年。戰後重加研究時，又發生了一個技術上的問題，就是究竟先從五彩電傳，還是先從黑白電傳，着手改進，幾經討論後，美國聯邦交通委員會決定先從黑白電傳著手。</p>
<p>和無綫電剛風行時一樣，無綫電傳影對美國的一般生活影響極大。本來成天和男友泡在一起的妙齡女郞也厮守在家裏了，——她把男友請到家中同觀電傳。頑童們也不在外邊闖禍了。最妙的是一家人家有了無綫電傳影機一之後，竟就會天天高朋滿座，使一主人不勝招待之苦，祗得要求這些佳客自帶點心來吃了。</p>
<p>今年適逢美國選舉總統，各競選人也爭於無綫電傳影前與選民相見。下而是美國「廣播」雜誌發表的成績：杜魯門·范登堡·和華萊士成績最好；杜威因有小髭，史泰遜太年輕，麥克阿瑟牛山濯濯，成績均略受影響，但尚能「派司」，最不行的莫如塔虎脫，「賣相一旣不漂亮，演辭又嫌單調。</p>
<p>無綫電傳影風行後，無綫電的出路祗限於盲人和忙碌的主婦間，此外則唯有在汽車中還有它的地位。（美國現有汽車無綫電九百三十萬架。）</p>
<h3>論專一</h3>
<p>— 碩甫</p>
<p>我在一個美國文學批評家兼散文家亞丁頓的集子中，讀到這樣一句斷句：「在同一時間內，常常想起半打以上的事情。」頗覺耐人尋味。如果一個人在同一時間能够完成六七件事，他一定可以獲得較常人六倍至七倍的成就。以寫文章而論，如果一位作家筆底下寫一篇短文，另向一位速記員口述一篇小說，腦中又在構思另一篇戯劇的情節，那末，此公在著作上的產量，足抵兩三位作家而有餘。</p>
<p>起初我很服膺這句話，推而廣之，一個人在一生中能够過着六七個人的生活，經歷豈非更見豐富？生命豈不是更有意義？因此，我也冒昧嘗試與此類似的緊凑生活，在我不自量力編一本經濟學稿本的時候，同時替某雜誌譯一長篇，這其間，我還抽出若干時間來寫一些小文章。</p>
<p>可是這樣一來，我的神經，常常很緊張，不時有牙痛等現象，漸漸我就發現犯了不能專一的弊病。幸虧我乘早發現，恢復在同一時間的只做一件事的原則，心靈上頓時輕鬆得多。</p>
<p>的確，專心工作，在精神上可以有一種閑適的感覺。舉一個例來說，如果你要翻譯一本小說的話，且把經濟學原理，企業管理等參考書一起搬進書橱去。你的桌上就放着一本原著，和英法文辭典等工具書。伏案寫作，自然有一種從容不迫的心理，翻譯的速度也倍增。我們更可以這樣說，專一是解決困難問題之鑰。</p>
<h3>親民之官</h3>
<p>— 銅駝</p>
<p>賴伽迭亞市長初蒞紐約，下車伊始，到警署偵查庭參觀。其時正是窮困的冬季，警局裏捉來了一個犯偸　麵包罪的失業者。　人惟一的辯護是家中人都在飢餓之中。</p>
<p>「我應當處罰你，」賴伽迭亞說。「因爲法律無例外。我現在宣判：你的竊盜罪應科罰金十元。」</p>
<p>賴伽迭亞於是伸手到口袋裏說，「這裏的錢是代你付罰款的。可是—」賴伽迭亞把自己的寬邊草帽拿下來，把十塊鈔票擲進去。「……可是這屋子中的每一個人，我要他們罰金五角，爲了他們所處的社會中竟有一個人要偸了麵包才有得吃。」</p>
<p>他拿了帽子，交給庭中一個人一個人傳過去，再把這一堆可噹作響的輔幣倒給又驚又喜的被告手中。</p>
<h3>談〔老婆〕</h3>
<p>俗稱己妻做「老婆」，其名很覺難聽。據說文云：「婆，奢也，一曰老母稱」，是婆乃老媼之稱。今「婆」上再冠「老」字，豈非變成「老老媼」乎？年齡至少要八十以上，方可得此稱號；今並年紀輕輕的亦稱「老婆」，觸耳之至！然此稱呼，宋人詩中已有，如王晋卿詩「老婆心急頻相勸」是。</p>
<p>稱己妻有謙稱「內人一的，這亦不大妥。按唐朝敎坊妓女選入宜春院，謂之「內人」，是內人變爲皇帝的禁　了！唐張祐有「內人已唱春鷥囀」之句可證。「內人」旣不可用，還是稱「內子」，因「子」亦可用之女人。孔老夫子不是見過衛靈公夫人南子，弄得子路大動肝火麽！（尢墨君）</p>
<p>一九零四年日俄戰役，淸政府已宣告中立，日人强入中國地域，拘捕已卸武裝之俄船，致薩鎭冰將軍受總督參處，亦是可氣之一事。光緒三十年七月八日，北洋大臣袁世凱奏報，據統轄北洋海軍總兵薩鎮冰稱，七月初一日四點十五分，俄國魚雷一艘駛入烟台中立區域，薩總兵即派員登艇查詢，將該艇砲械魚雷機器各件拆卸，並簽名具結，不預戰事，不掛俄旗，經我海軍督率辦竣，領泊西澳，另派海容艦看守；至七點鐘，日本雷艇二艘進口，該總兵親到日艇，告以俄艇軍械已卸，日管帶允須臾即去，不意初二日早三點鐘，日艇三十餘人登俄艇，海容艦阻之不聰，旋將俄船拖去，該總兵即升旗令其停輪，其拖俄艇者眞行不理；其一停輪，該總兵復派海圻兵船大副告以俄船已卸　，不應拖去，日管帶答云當趕告前船，將俄艇拖回，不料一去不返等情；該總兵薩鎭冰於俄艇進口，已按公法妥辦，乃因輕信日人之言，致俄艇竟被日艇拖去，雖經多方攔阻，究屬保護不力，除電外務部照諸日使查辦外，應請旨將薩鎭冰飭交兵部議處，以示懲儆。按此事亦可當一幕倭人現形記觀之，其行爲則蠻不講理，其言語則詐偽百出，即云濫用强權，亦毫無磊落光明之氣度。</p>
<p>七七事變，開始正式抗戰，在七七以前，倭人蓄意挑釁，神出鬼沒，其侮辱國人，阻　政令，時時處處，攪擾不堪。「九一八」佔東三省後，平津及冀魯兩省失其藩籬，已暴露於嚴墻之下，倭人自由行動，復强遣許多不法浪人入關，以烟賭等卑下營藥，誘惑詐欺，無所不至，而最慣演者則隨時製造所謂「旣成事實」，即「掠則爲產，强則必婚」的惡俗惡態，不論法律，不論條約，或侵或奪之後，則以已占己奪爲當然，可惡亦復可突。</p>

        <h1>1948.06.17</h1>
<h3>US Senate Passes Aid to China Bill; House Restores Almost All Cuts; Compromise Bill Being Drafted with House</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 10th Day] The $460 million aid to China plan was passed by the Senate on the morning of the 16th with a vote of 60 to 9 after two and a half hours of discussion. Following the Senate's passage of the bill, representatives were immediately appointed to draft a compromise bill with House representatives. The Senate-passed aid to China plan restored $60 million of the $63 million cut by the House. It stipulates that $335 million of the $460 million will be used as economic assistance under the management of the Economic Cooperation Administration, while the remaining $125 million will be granted to China for free disposal, to be used for military or other purposes. The Senate has restored the aid plan's duration to twelve months and removed the House's stipulation that the entire aid to China plan be supervised in accordance with the aid methods for Greece and Turkey. In its report, the Senate Appropriations Committee strongly urged careful handling of economic aid to China funds to avoid confusion with the $125 million grant for military purposes. The committee believes that adopting a policy of inaction would have extremely unfortunate consequences. The committee stated: "We were deeply impressed by the confidential opinions of Secretary of the Army Royall and General Wedemeyer." The committee also stated: "(During discussions on China, we learned that the situation in China is still hopeful)." At the same time, it warned Congress that American officials sent to China to implement the plan should be absolutely loyal to the United States and absolutely anti-communist. Although the committee urged that the $125 million grant for free disposal be used for military purposes, it did not change the original legislative intent.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 15th Day] The House Appropriations Committee on the 15th rejected the State Department's request for $5 million. Most of this amount was to be used for agricultural, scientific, and student exchange programs between the department and China.</p>
<h3>Handling of US Materials Committee Ends at Midnight; Food Rationing in Five Cities to Continue</h3>
<p>Stillman Investigation Team to Depart Shanghai Tomorrow</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 10th Day] In accordance with the Sino-American Relief Agreement, the Executive Yuan's Committee for Handling American Materials will conclude its mission at 12:00 noon on the 19th. Thereafter, all matters related to the handling of American relief materials will be transferred to the Executive Yuan's Committee for the Utilization of US Aid. The food rationing program in the five major cities, managed by the Committee for Handling American Materials, will continue to be implemented in the future. Plans are also underway to expand its rationing scope and area. Before its conclusion, the Handling Committee decided to establish a financial committee to organize and audit all past accounts. On the morning of the 16th, the committee held its fifth joint meeting with the Chinese Relief Association to review the allocation of subsidies for medicine, health, agriculture, and social relief, with Lai Puhan also invited to attend.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 16th Day] Yan Jia'gan, liaison officer of the US Aid Utilization Committee, flew to Shanghai by plane on the afternoon of the 16th and will depart from Shanghai with the Stillman Investigation Team on the 18th to conduct on-site investigations in Hubei, Hunan, Guangdong, Taiwan, and other places.</p>
<h3>Legislative Yuan Foreign Affairs Committee Meeting; Foreign Minister Wang Reports on Diplomacy</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 16th Day] The Foreign Affairs Committee of the Legislative Yuan held a closed-door meeting at 3:30 p.m. on the 16th, with more than 70 committee members present, presided over by Zhang Daoxing. Foreign Minister Wang Shijie was invited to attend with Huang Zhengming, Director of the East Asian Affairs Department, and Chen Shicai, Assistant of the American Affairs Department. He presented a relatively concrete and detailed report on diplomatic issues, followed by the committee members expressing their opinions. The meeting adjourned at 7 p.m. It is reported that Wang emphasized the need to continue to strengthen friendly Sino-American relations to prevent schemers from succeeding in their plots. Regarding Soviet diplomacy, although we must abide by treaty obligations, we are determined to engage in difficult negotiations to resolve outstanding issues. Wang also stated that the Soviet Union may provide some support to communist parties in various countries, but not to the extent of immediately causing an international war. Regarding the issue of Japan, we should insist on obtaining compensation, and the control after the peace treaty is signed is particularly important to our country, and we will not retreat from our position. In addition, Wang also elaborated on US aid and United Nations issues.</p>
<h3>Wang Yunwu Reports on Second Half of Year Finances</h3>
<p>Measures to Rectify Tax Collection Being Drafted</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 16th Day] The Finance and Banking Committee of the Legislative Yuan held a closed-door meeting on the afternoon of the 16th to hear the government's financial report. The meeting was chaired by Liu Zhendong, convener of the committee, with more than 100 legislators including Deng Feihuang, Jiang Yiping, and Cui Jingbo in attendance. Minister of Finance Wang Yunwu and Vice Minister of Finance Xu Bi were invited to attend. Wang Yunwu reported on the current financial situation for one hour. Wang's report was frank and pragmatic, providing a detailed analysis of the current financial situation. The report can be divided into two parts: one is the current state of national revenue, and the other is the plan to balance revenue and expenditure. Wang first stated that the tax revenue for the first half of the year was 45 trillion to 50 trillion yuan, and the budget for tax revenue in the second half of the year is approximately 300 trillion yuan. The total budgeted financial revenue is expected to reach more than 540 trillion yuan (please refer to the first page of this newspaper on the 16th). As for the expenditure budget, it is currently being compiled by the Directorate-General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics. The ordinary revenue and expenditure of the second half of the year are expected to be balanced, while special expenditures will require other solutions. The expenditures in the second half of the year, in addition to ordinary administrative expenses, are mainly for the salaries of civil servants, soldiers, military officers, and for the suppression of the rebellion. Efforts will be made to gradually bring revenue and expenditure closer to balance. The current plan is to increase revenue in the following four ways: (1) Expanding tax sources and rectifying tax collection; (2) Utilizing US aid; (3) Selling relief materials; (4) Selling enemy and puppet materials. Measures for expanding tax sources and rectifying tax collection are currently being drafted and will soon be submitted to the Legislative Yuan to complete the legislative process and be implemented. Regarding the issue of levying property tax, the Ministry of Finance is extremely supportive in principle, but the technical aspects still need to be studied. As for the use of overseas deposits of Chinese citizens, our country has negotiated with deposit countries several times in the past, but foreign countries are unwilling to provide the list of depositors based on their banking laws, so there is currently no good way to use them. In his report, Wang also mentioned the current foreign exchange policy, saying that Yu Hongjun has made considerable improvements, and the Ministry of Finance will cooperate closely with the Central Bank in the future. After Wang's report, more than ten people including Wu Wangji made suggestions and inquiries, and Wang gave them all replies. The meeting adjourned at 7 p.m.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 16th Day] The Ministry of Finance has drafted a plan to rectify tax collection and expand tax sources, which will soon be submitted to the Legislative Yuan to complete the legislative process and be implemented within days. The plan stipulates improvement measures for customs, salt, commodities, and direct taxes. The details are as follows: (1) Customs duties will be revised, tax rates will be increased, except for those restricted by reciprocal treaties that cannot be revised, the rest will be appropriately increased. (2) Salt tax rates will be slightly increased, provided that it does not hinder the burden on the common people. (3) For commodity tax, the basis for taxation in the past was the price of goods two months ago. In the future, it will be changed to the price of goods one month ago as the basis for collection. (4) Efforts will be made to eliminate embezzlement in direct taxes.</p>
<h3>Legislative Yuan National Defense Committee Holds Closed Meeting; He Guqin Reports on Military Affairs; Significant Progress in Suppressing Rebellion Militarily Within Six Months</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 16th Day] The National Defense Committee of the Legislative Yuan held a closed-door meeting on the afternoon of the 16th to hear the government's military report. More than 100 committee members attended, chaired by Zeng Kuoqing, convener of the committee. He Yingqin and Gu Zhutong attended. He first reported on the policy of suppressing the rebellion and剿匪, followed by Gu continuing to report on the growth and decline of our and the bandits' strengths and the future strategic policy. Finally, Luo Zemin, Director of the Third Department of the Ministry of National Defense, reported on the current situation. The focus of He and Gu's reports, in addition to re-explaining the military part of Weng Wenhao's administrative policy, was optimistic about the future of suppressing the rebellion, believing that it could be concluded within two or three years. Significant progress in suppressing the rebellion militarily will be made within the next six months. Currently, forces are being concentrated to adopt an active and proactive strategy, first seeking to clear the central China battlefield of bandits south of the Yellow River, then clearing Hebei, and then recovering the lost territories in the Northeast. Mobile tactics will be used to first seek the connection of point to point for important strongholds. He and Gu both particularly emphasized the importance of raising morale, improving the treatment of soldiers, and establishing local forces, and implementing total war is also an urgent task for the future. Gu admitted in his report that the bandit army has increased compared to when Japan surrendered. The bandits currently have more than one million regular troops and more than 900,000 militia. The increase in the strength of the National Army is double that of the bandit army, with more than 5.2 million regular troops currently. Luo Zemin stated when reporting on the enemy's and our capabilities that there is no need to worry about the Shandong battlefield, and Xuzhou can be secured. After He, Gu, and others finished their reports, more than ten committee members raised suggestions and inquiries, expressing great concern about the current war situation and dissatisfaction with the conscription system, advocating changing it to a voluntary enlistment system. He, Gu, and others gave separate replies.</p>

<h3>Chen Ke Expresses Views on US Policy of Supporting Japan</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Nanjing, 16th Day] President of the Legislative Yuan Sun Ke stated in an exclusive interview with an Associated Press reporter on the 16th when discussing China's views on the US policy towards Japan: "Ambassador Stuart's statement not only failed to explain, but aroused resentment." Sun defended the right of Chinese students, professors, intellectuals, and any Chinese people to question and demand answers regarding the US policy towards Japan.

<h3>Foreign Minister Wang Banquets Soviet Ambassador</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 16th Day] Foreign Minister Wang Shijie hosted a banquet at his official residence at 7:30 p.m. on the 16th for the newly appointed Soviet Ambassador to China, Major General Roschin, Counselor Huang Delin, Commercial Representative Shchurfiner, Military Attaché Duleven, and Secretary Gutikov.</p>
<h3>Youth Party Sends Letter to Weng Wenhao; Declares Non-Participation in Executive Yuan; Separate Letter Explains Details to Chen and Lei</h3>
<p>[Our City News] The Youth Party, due to the prolonged unresolved issue of legislators, has decided not to participate in the Executive Yuan in order to carry out its previous statement. It also does not intend to nominate candidates for participation in the Judicial and Examination Yuan. After making this decision at a meeting of its Central Standing Committee on the morning of the 16th, the party immediately telegraphed Premier Weng, requesting him to promptly seek other candidates for the two ministerial posts and the two political committee member posts to avoid a vacancy in government affairs. At the same time, it sent letters to Chen Bulei and Lei Zhen, explaining the details.</p>
<h3>Conversation with a Certain KMT Figure</h3>
<p>President Hopes Youth Party Will Participate in Government</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 16th Day] Regarding the letter sent by Chen Qitian, Zuo Shunsheng, and two others from the Youth Party to Premier Weng of the Executive Yuan, stating that they cannot participate in the government, a reporter interviewed a certain figure in the Chinese Kuomintang familiar with the issue of the Youth Party's participation in the government to inquire about his opinion. He replied: "As far as I know, the letter sent by Chen, Zuo, and the other two to Premier Weng has not yet arrived in Nanjing. We have only seen the press release disclosing the letter. The responsible figures of the Youth Party are still using the unresolved issue of the number of legislators as a reason for expressing their non-participation in the government. We really cannot understand this. It is even more regrettable if this affects the cooperation between the Youth Party and our party since the beginning of the Anti-Japanese War. (1) Legally speaking, legislators should be elected based on the number of votes received, but the responsible figures of our party's Central Committee have repeatedly expressed regret that the Youth Party's elected legislators have not reached the expected number, and are currently doing their best to remedy the situation while taking into account the facts. The importance our party attaches to the Youth Party's cooperation can be seen from this. (2) In terms of party politics, the status of a minority party in the Legislative Yuan is not determined by the number of members. However, our party's Central Committee is striving to increase the number of friendly party members. This work takes time, but unexpectedly, members of friendly parties do not understand this. (3) We believe that the participation of Youth Party members in the Executive Yuan to jointly plan the country's major affairs can enhance the cooperation between the two parties and help resolve the issue of legislators. Now, the Youth Party insists on the issue of the number of legislators as a prerequisite for their participation in the Executive Yuan, which confuses two different issues and only increases the difficulty of resolving the problem." Finally, the figure also told the reporter: "President Chiang is planning to invite Youth Party members to serve as Vice President of the Examination Yuan and has asked the party to recommend Grand Justices and Examination Committee members. I firmly believe that President Chiang and our party's Central Committee will not easily give up hope for the Youth Party. I sincerely hope that the Youth Party will resolutely break the deadlock and participate in the government, based on a spirit of mutual understanding and mutual trust, and treat our party with sincerity so that the original intention of cooperating to save the country in the past can be carried out. At this constitutional period, no matter what, the interests of the country should be placed above the interests of the party."</p>
<h3>First Sound of Exercising Powers; Price Hikes Should Not Be Ignored; Control Yuan Proposes Corrective Action; Asks Government to Take Emergency Measures Swiftly</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 16th Day] The first Control Yuan supervisors under the constitution exercised their powers for the first time on the 16th, using corrective powers to propose corrective action to the Executive Yuan authorities. The cause of the case states: "The recent surge in prices, with no effective measures taken by the government, should be corrected." This was a temporary motion proposed by supervisors Quan Shaowen, Chen Lianyuan, Guo Changhe, Chai Feng, and 31 others at the third meeting held on the morning of the 16th. After the president of the Yuan brought it up at the meeting, it immediately gained the consent of all supervisors. It was decided to propose it in the name of the general assembly and sent to the Executive Yuan in the afternoon of the 16th. The case was proposed at the time of adjournment, which was past 12 o'clock. After the secretariat read the full text, some supervisors believed that the wording should be studied and advocated for the establishment of a review committee to review it before submitting it for approval at the general assembly on the 17th. Others suggested that it was already time for adjournment and that opinions on extending the time should be sought before discussion. At this time, a supervisor stated in a very solemn tone: "Everyone must know that some people are eager to adjourn because it is time for dinner, but you must know that we are representing millions of people to exercise our powers. We cannot delay the lack of food for the majority for the sake of the individual's dinner!" Others advocated that the matter was extremely important and that the time should be extended indefinitely. Then, someone proposed that a discussion should be held on whether it should be proposed in the name of the general assembly or in the name of the proposers. However, after some people spoke, it was unanimously agreed that it should be proposed in the name of the general assembly, and that the corrective action had already been endorsed by more than 30 people, so there was no need to submit it for review again, and it was unanimously passed. The specific reasons for the case are recorded as follows: "Recently, prices have been rising like wildfire, affecting the entire country with panic. At this time of mobilization to suppress the rebellion, it is crucial to stabilize the people's livelihood. However, the administrative authorities have so far ignored this and have not taken appropriate countermeasures. Some measures even contribute to the rise in prices, such as: (1) the unrestrained lending of national banks and the increase in lending interest rates; (2) the leadership of state-owned enterprises in raising prices; (3) regarding the issue of currency reform, the relevant authorities have repeatedly made irresponsible remarks, affecting the people's confidence in the legal tender, leading to the daily depreciation of the currency and the increase in prices. If this situation is allowed to continue, it will inevitably shake the foundation of the country. We believe that it is necessary to request the government to take emergency measures swiftly, and we hereby propose corrective action according to law. Respectfully request a public decision."</p>
<p>Drafting of Control Law Completed; To Be Proposed for Discussion at Fourth Yuan Meeting Today</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 16th Day] The Control Yuan held its third meeting at 9:30 a.m. on the 16th, chaired by Yu Youren. The cases discussed today were: (1) the draft Control Law, (2) the draft Organization Law of Various Committees. The first case has been largely discussed. A drafting committee will be re-established to meet in the afternoon of the 16th to study it in detail and propose it for discussion article by article at the fourth meeting to be held on the morning of the 17th. The second case was given a general discussion, but as it was time for adjournment, the drafting and review work will be carried out after the drafting of the Control Law is completed.</p>
<p>The content of the Control Law includes the procedures for exercising the powers of consent, impeachment, censure, and corrective action. The entire case is divided into six chapters, including Chapter 1 General Provisions, Chapter 2 Power of Consent, Chapter 3 Power of Impeachment, Chapter 4 Power of Censure, Chapter 5 Power of Corrective Action, and Chapter 6 Supplementary Provisions, totaling 32 articles. After the chairman announced the start of the discussion, the supervisors spoke one after another, mostly focusing on strengthening their own powers. During the discussion of the case on the Organization Law of Various Committees, most expressed that too many people were being used in the various committees, which was close to wasteful, and that it was not necessary to make rigid regulations. As for the establishment of the various committees, they should be established according to the nature of the various ministries and commissions of the Executive Yuan. Zhang Dinghua stated that another committee should be established to target the Judicial and Examination Yuan, otherwise, there would be no way to investigate if the two Yuans violated the law or neglected their duties. Wang Guanwu advocated adding a Food Committee, while the Military Committee should be changed to a National Defense Committee, as national defense can include military affairs. The general discussion was thus completed.</p>
<p>The drafting committee of the Control Law of the Control Yuan held a meeting at 3:30 p.m. on the 10th, with 39 supervisors in attendance, chaired by Lü Chao. The draft proposed by the 　 committee was discussed article by article. Because changes in some words and phrases would affect the powers of the Control Yuan, the discussion was extremely cautious. The following are the points that were discussed for a long time and had many differences: (1) In Article 2, when the Control Yuan exercises its supervisory powers, the original draft stipulated that the Control Yuan would send personnel to investigate. The investigation power has now been amended to be enhanced, and supervisors can go to various agencies and public organizations to conduct investigation work by holding an inspection certificate or by special investigation certificates issued by the Control Yuan Supervisors' Office. (2) In the Power of Consent section of Chapter 2, some advocated deleting the entire section and drafting a separate method, but some argued that the power of consent is a type of supervisory power and should not be listed separately. It was then decided not to list it separately, but to make amendments to the articles. The original Article 8 was deleted, and Article 9 was changed to "When the President nominates the President and Vice President of the Judicial Yuan, the President and Vice President of the Examination Yuan, and the Grand Justices of the Judicial Yuan and the Examination Committee members of the Examination Yuan, they shall attach their qualifications and opinions for review. If the Control Yuan does not agree, it shall request the President to nominate another candidate in writing." (3) In the Power of Impeachment section of Chapter 3, the procedures for conducting impeachment cases are stipulated in great detail. Among them, there are rigid regulations on the filing of impeachment cases. The review committee met until 8:30 p.m. before adjourning. This draft will be proposed for discussion at the fourth meeting on the morning of the 17th.</p>

Over a hundred soldiers from Qian's brigade headquarters were also killed. However, Qian, believing in our invincibility and seeking only victory regardless of sacrifice, finally defeated the stubborn bandits, creating a glorious victory. A reporter took a special car to the battlefield on the 16th and still saw bullet holes everywhere and bandit corpses everywhere, showing the intensity of the battle. To reward the meritorious, Wang Yaowu not only gave the brigade a reward of 500 million yuan and recorded a major merit, but also reported to the Ministry of National Defense for awards to meritorious generals below Brigade Commander Qian.</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Adjustment of the International Military System</h3>
<p>Since the establishment of the Two-Constitution government organization, there have been new changes in the opening of national defense military administration, both in personnel and in systems. In terms of personnel, General He Yingqin has been appointed as the Minister of National Defense, and General Gu Zhutong has succeeded him as the Chief of the General Staff. The personnel of the suppression headquarters in other regions have also been newly adjusted in accordance with the new situation. In terms of systems, the national defense military system has been re-established, and the National Defense Department's Organic Law has been revised. According to Premier Weng of the Executive Yuan's reply to the Legislative Yuan's questions on the 15th regarding the reform of military administration, he stated: The basic principles of the National Defense Department's revised Organic Law have been approved by the President, which stipulate that "the Minister of National Defense is responsible for military policy and administration, and the Chief of the General Staff is the Chief of Staff of the Commander-in-Chief and the administrative officer of the Minister of National Defense, responsible for the planning and guidance of military affairs." "The Chief of the General Staff shall act on military orders in accordance with the President's orders, and on military administration matters in accordance with the Minister's orders, or as instructed by the Minister." This is the outline of the new national defense military system. Undoubtedly, it has undergone fundamental changes from the old National Defense Department's organization in terms of nature and command system. It is expected that the revised Organic Law will be more easily passed by the Legislative Yuan. In fact, this new national defense military system is more rational and perfect than the old form.</p>
<p>The Ministry of National Defense is the central nerve of a country's military cells and the hub of the command structure. Military action relies on command, and the flexibility of command relies on wisdom. Wisdom does not originate from one person, but from a multitude of think tanks and experienced people. The final choice of a point to command and utilize rests with one person. The Ministry of National Defense manages military administration and military orders, like a person with two arms, like a bird with two wings. Military administration and military orders must be divided, especially in terms of intellectual division, but their planned actions and issued command orders are ultimately decided by the supreme commander. The central headquarters of various countries during wartime and the government telecommunications system of our country during wartime are all like this. The Ministry of National Defense established in our country the year before last was a scaled-down version of the wartime Military Affairs Commission in terms of administration; in terms of system, it concentrated the power of military administration and military orders in one person. As a result, the Minister of National Defense had no real power, and all military administration and military orders were completely controlled by the Chief of the General Staff. The Chief of Staff had four general headquarters under him: Army, Air Force, Navy, and Joint Logistics. The Chief of Staff reported directly to the Chairman of the National Government. Thus, the so-called Minister of National Defense was equivalent to the Executive Yuan representative of the Chief of Staff. The characteristic of this system was the unified command of the army, navy, and air force, and the unified handling of forward operations and rear services by one person, with the advantage of "focusing on one point," without fear of disconnection or feeling of shortage. However, at the same time, it also had many shortcomings: excessive power, prone to arbitrariness, not accountable to the Executive Yuan, nor to the Legislative Yuan, and no one but the head of state could control it. This system of military power above all else seemed to have never been used by any country in the world. The old Legislative Yuan of our country did not pass the Organic Law of the Ministry of National Defense and repeatedly warned, pointing out the danger of this system. But this system finally underwent two years of trials and is now coming to a historical end.</p>
<p>In this reorganization of the Ministry of National Defense, the personnel appointments were that General He Yingqin would serve as the Minister, and he is an advanced military officer who commanded both the military administration and military order systems during the Anti-Japanese War without any bias. General Gu Zhutong, the Chief of the General Staff, is a sincere and steady strategist. In terms of systems, this adjustment of the national defense military system is to gather the wisdom of the majority in the nerve center, and to use the division of military administration and military orders to assist the President as commander-in-chief in selection and command. Its differences from the old system are threefold: (1) In the new Ministry of National Defense, the power of the Minister of National Defense has been considerably increased, and he directs the Chief of the General Staff in military policy and military administration. The Minister is responsible to the Executive Yuan, and the Chief of Staff is responsible to the Minister; (2) The Minister of National Defense is a member of the political affairs meeting, so the Executive Yuan can control the military administration part through the Minister. As for military orders, which relate to national defense secrets, they are not controlled by the Executive Yuan, but are directly commanded by the President; (3) The position of the Chief of the General Staff is technical and intellectual. In terms of military orders, he is the Commander-in-Chief's advisor, designing and commanding the three armed forces for the President. In terms of military administration, he is the Minister's administrative assistant, planning and executing business for the Minister.</p>
<p>Based on these three points, the power of the Chief of the General Staff has been reduced. The power to handle military administration has been handed over to the Minister of National Defense, and the command of operations belongs to the President. The military administration and military orders executed by the Chief of the General Staff avoid arbitrariness and avoid centralization of power. He is a chief of staff who handles matters according to orders and instructions, rather than a主管 chief officer with the power to exert independent will. From a theoretical and factual point of view, this adjustment of the national defense military system is more rational; especially at the present stage when the suppression of rebellion is extremely tense, this adjustment is more perfect.</p>
<p>The military system emphasizes effectiveness, and command and operations emphasize timing; in short, achieving excellent results and seizing favorable opportunities are deeply related to the three factors of 天時 favorable timing, 地利 geographical advantages, and 人和 human harmony. Speaking of 天時 favorable timing, the current national defense military system is in line with the trend and facts; speaking of 地利 geographical advantages, the adjustment of the military system will inevitably be followed by an adjustment of strategy. Today, the main battlefields are in the Central Plains and North China, and the military headquarters must have a clear plan for the re-deployment of strategy; speaking of 人事 personnel, the harmonious relationship between Generals He and Gu, the command of suppression headquarters in various regions, the use and arrangement of military talents, and the support of local forces, can be expected to have progressive measures. Based on this view, we are optimistic about the future military effectiveness and the timing of operations, and we look forward to the new Ministry of National Defense.</p>
<h3>The Dao is in Excrement; Hu Xianwen Claims: Studying Yang Mei Should First Explore Excrement</h3>
<p>[Dispatch from Chongqing, 16th] Dean Hu Xianwen, who presided over Yang Mei's examination, gave insightful views on Yang Mei's problem today. He said: Society only pays attention to Yang Mei's not eating, but ignores Yang Mei's strangely small amount of urine in the past 21 days. Historically, there have been starvation experts, but Yang Mei's having a drop of urine in the last ten days of the examination is rare. An average person urinates at least 500 cc per day, otherwise they will be poisoned, and it is absolutely impossible to forcibly not urinate. Where exactly are her excrement hidden? This is still a great mystery and deserves attention. Therefore, regardless of whether Yang Mei's not eating is real or fake, long-term or short-term, before the truth is clear, the phenomenon of her little urine is enough for scientists to study and explore.</p>

<p>[Dispatch from Suzhou, 16th] The Suzhou County Government received a secret report today: There is an illegal securities market with huge transactions in the Chuhui Building on Guanqian Street.

<h3>Developing the Guangdong Sugar Industry; More Hopeful Than Taiwan Sugar</h3>
<p>Said Zi'en of the National Resources Commission</p>
<p>[Dispatch from Central News Agency, Taipei, 16th] The National Resources Commission previously planned to cooperate with the Guangdong Provincial Government to develop the Guangdong sugar industry by dismantling and relocating Taiwan's abandoned sugar factories to Guangdong. It is now planned to dismantle and relocate two sugar factories: one is the Hualien Factory, and the other is the Taichung Second Factory. The former has a daily sugarcane crushing capacity of 1,000 tons, and the latter has 550 tons. However, both factories were damaged during the war, especially the Taichung Factory, where two-thirds of the damaged and missing parts must be repaired and fitted. This task is quite difficult, and the machines are also too old. According to Xi Zi'en, who was sent by the National Resources Commission to Taiwan to investigate these two factories, "From an economic point of view, the funds required to dismantle these two broken factories and repair and fit the parts would be more than building a new factory, which is not cost-effective." Therefore, whether to dismantle and relocate them in the future will depend on his consultation in Guangdong. Xi Zi'en also said: Sugarcane can be grown in Guangdong Province in 12 months, while it takes 16 months in Taiwan Province. The regional conditions are better than those in Taiwan Province, the cost is lower than in Taiwan Province, and the future is very hopeful.</p>

<h3>The Gansu Provincial Government Sends Personnel to Supervise the Repair of the President's Residence on Xinglong Mountain</h3>
<p>[Dispatch from This Newspaper, Lanzhou, 16th] The President's residence on Xinglong Mountain in Yuzhong, Gansu, has been dilapidated due to disrepair in recent years. The Gansu Provincial Government recently decided to allocate funds for repairs and sent Zhang Weiyou, a technician from the Department of Construction, and engineer Zhao Yong to be responsible for supervising the repairs. Note: Xinglong Mountain is a major scenic spot near Lanzhou, full of greenery and streams. The President's residence is built to the left of the Chaoyuan Temple at the foot of the mountain.

Later, it was used as a guest house by the Lanzhou Lishi Society for tourists to eat and stay. It is now borrowed by Zhang Zhizhong, Director of the Northwest 行 Department.

<h3>A Life of a Student in Lanzhou; Two Hundred Million Yuan in Compensation</h3>

<h3>Soviet Note to British Government Opposes Establishment of West German Government West German Monetary Reform Reaches Agreement</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 16th] A spokesman for the Soviet Embassy announced today that the Soviet Union has sent a note to Britain stating that it is difficult to accept the London Six-Power Agreement's resolution to establish a West German government independently, and believes that the agreement violates the Potsdam Agreement. This matter was notified by the Soviet Ambassador to Britain, Zarubin, to Strang, the chairman of the London Six-Power Conference, on June 7, as the first formal statement of Soviet opposition to the Six-Power Agreement. However, Moscow Radio and Soviet newspapers had already expressed that the Soviet government could not accept the Six-Power Agreement when the Six-Power Conference was held, so this move was indeed expected.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Berlin, 16th] Rumors are rife here that the Soviet and American authorities are currently discussing the possibility of jointly implementing monetary reform in the four occupied zones of Germany. American officials have already come here from Frankfurt to discuss the matter.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Frankfurt, 15th] The heads of the British, American, and French military governments and their financial advisors held an important meeting tonight, lasting about three hours, mostly discussing the issue of monetary reform. It is believed here that the three zones of West Germany are prepared to proceed with their economic and financial merger plan. Although the American military governor, Clay, refused to discuss the contents of the talks after today's meeting, he made it clear that there was no need to continue talks with the French military governor, Koenig, on the topic of today's meeting. Clay stated that he did not yet know the outcome of the French National Assembly's debate on the London Conference's recommendations, but said that whatever resolution the French parliament may make, it would not affect the resolutions made by the heads of the three military governments today. When asked whether the date of implementation of monetary reform had been informed to German officials, he replied that it had not. When asked whether he intended to accept the Germans' suggestion of implementing tax reform at the same time as monetary reform, he replied that the Germans' suggestion was quite appropriate, but the timing of implementation would depend on unforeseen factors. Clay also stated that today's meeting of the heads of the three military governments did not involve government issues. A communiqué will soon be issued in Frankfurt. He also said that the American side plans to hold another meeting with the French side in Berlin on Wednesday to discuss another issue.</p>
<h3>French Parliament Representatives Decide on West German Agreement Government Strives with Resignation 美英不接受法所提建議</h3>
<h3>US and Britain Do Not Accept France's Proposed Recommendations</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] London, 16th Broadcast: Paris Report, the French cabinet held a four-hour meeting today and decided not to regard the results of the vote on the Six-Power Agreement in the parliament as a formal vote of confidence or no confidence. However, if the National Assembly expresses no confidence, the cabinet has decided to resign.</p>
<p>[United Press, Paris, 16th] The parliamentary debate, which began last Friday, will resume at 3:30 this afternoon. When the left and right wings heavily criticize the government, Schuman and Bidault will respond one by one. Most opponents of the government demanded that the Six-Power Conference on Germany be reopened. In order to win the approval of Britain and the United States at the last moment, the French Foreign Ministry Secretary-General, Chauvel, spent most of the time in London on the 15th talking with British and American officials. However, according to reliable sources, London and Washington have not accepted France's request.</p>
<p>It is rumored that Schuman is preparing to submit the cabinet's resignation to President Auriol after the parliamentary vote on the evening of the 16th, and has completed the list of the new cabinet for submission together. Among the ministers rumored to be resigning from the cabinet is Bidault, but the government spokesman later firmly denied this.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Paris, 15th] Bidault's speech to the National Assembly today did not open up the stalemate faced by the government in the parliament. Opinions within the Socialist Party regarding the London resolutions are still divided. De Gaulle's fierce criticism obviously has a significant impact on the National Assembly's debate, and the fact that Britain and the United States are sacrificing France to support Germany is of concern to most French people. The Socialist Party still hopes that Bevin will support France's proposal and agree to expand the control over the Ruhr, so that the joint management of the Ruhr's industry by the six countries is not limited to managing the distribution of its industrial products.</p>
<h3>Britain Expands Navy Senate Passes Appropriation</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 16th] The Senate today passed the $3,686,733,250 naval expansion bill by voice vote, making it the most powerful navy in the world, an increase of over $125 million compared to the amount approved by the House of Representatives. The bill will be returned to the House of Representatives for discussion. It provides for $6 million to build the world's largest aircraft carrier, in order to carry the fastest jet-propelled aircraft or bombers capable of carrying atomic bombs.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 15th] The House Appropriations Committee has approved an appropriation of $485,196,951 for expanding the defense of Alaska and storing strategic materials.</p>
<h3>British-Soviet Trade Negotiations to Resume in London</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, London, 15th] British Minister of Trade Wilson said today that British-Soviet trade negotiations will resume in London, and he will represent the British government to participate. However, if it is necessary to continue in Moscow, Undersecretary Bottomley, who is in charge of overseas trade at the Ministry of Trade, will go. The basis for British-Soviet trade in the future will be the large-scale transportation of British goods to the Soviet Union, rather than the small-scale trade previously advocated by the Soviet Union.</p>
<h3>Malayan Uprising Expands British Commissioner Issues Emergency Order</h3>
<p>Singapore Military Police on Alert</p>
<p>[Reuters, Singapore, Tenth Day] The uprising of the Malayan Communist Party is expanding. The British High Commissioner to Malaya, Sir Gurney, has issued an order declaring a state of emergency, allowing curfews to be imposed in any location, allowing the arrest of suspected elements, and imposing the death penalty on those who illegally possess weapons. The most recent act of violence occurred last night near Ipoh in Perak State, where three British people were shot and killed by twelve armed bandits, who then looted property and set fire to houses. Rubber plantations owned by Europeans throughout Malaya are all uneasy. Seven large plantations have already suspended operations, and white people are preparing to evacuate. Singapore is currently still considered stable, but the military police are on alert to prevent riots from occurring.</p>
<h3>Danube Conference to be Held Next Month Soviet Union Accepts US Proposal Austria to be Observer</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 15th] The State Department revealed that the Soviet Union has agreed to convene the Danube Conference on July 30. In addition to stating the previous exceptions, the Soviet Embassy in Washington submitted a note to the US government yesterday agreeing to invite Austria to attend the conference as an observer, allowing it to provide opinions without the right to vote. The Soviet note also stated that regarding the location of the meeting being set in Belgrade, it could not be accepted by the Soviet Union because the Yugoslav government was unable to prepare the general preparations for convening the meeting on that day, and suggested that it be held in the capital of another Danube riparian country.</p>
<p>The Soviet note also agreed to the US proposal that the invitations to convene the Danube Conference should be issued by the Four Powers. This Soviet note was a response to the US proposal made on May 26, requesting that the decision to convene the Danube Conference made by the Foreign Ministers Conference last December be implemented. The Foreign Ministers Conference decided that the Danube Conference should be attended by the representatives of the Four Powers of the Foreign Ministers Conference, and the Danube countries of the Soviet Union, Ukraine, Bulgaria, Romania, Czechoslovakia, and Austria. Because the Austrian peace treaty has not yet been concluded, Austria's participation has become one of the points of contention between the Soviet Union and the Western powers. The Soviet Union's agreement to discuss one of the "specific issues" mentioned by Marshall with the United States is also the first time that the United States and the Soviet Union have engaged in a diplomatic battle in recent weeks. The US proposal to the Soviet Union to implement the Foreign Ministers Conference resolution to convene the Danube Conference came a few days after the launch of the US-Soviet diplomatic battle. At the time, some people believed that the US move was intended to initiate the resumption of negotiations with the Soviet Union on minor issues first, in order to test whether the Soviet Union had the sincerity to peacefully resolve all issues.</p>
<h3>Preventing the Development of Communism Lies in Economic Aid to Asia</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, London, 15th] The "Manchester Guardian" stated in today's editorial on the expansion of communism in Asia and its relationship with other parts of the world that communism is currently developing in most countries in Asia, especially in places such as Burma, Ceylon, Indonesia, Vietnam, and Malaya. However, if communism wants to seize the entire of Asia, it must first gain an advantage in China and India. However, the current position of the Chinese Nationalist Party is not as serious as generally believed. Since the Kuomintang is committed to defending Chinese traditions, it has gained considerable support. The report continued that if India or China or both fall under the control of the Communist Party, the political and economic organization of the entire world will be changed. But the Western world must not want the Sovietization of Asia, and the way to prevent this is to emulate the approach of the Marshall Plan for Europe and provide economic assistance to Asia in order to save some of the worst economic situations.</p>
<h3>US and Britain Urge Three Nordic Countries to Form Alliance Against Aggression</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 15th] Well-informed sources in Sweden said today that the United States and Britain have urged Sweden to participate in the Scandinavian joint defense. Sweden has indicated that any regional joint defense between Norway and Denmark, combined with the joint defense of the five countries of Britain, France, Belgium, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg, is something Sweden is unwilling to participate in in order to avoid angering the Soviet Union, and that Sweden cannot obtain military assistance. Norway and Denmark do not believe that Scandinavia can maintain neutrality once war breaks out between the West and the East, and hope to maintain joint defense with Western Europe.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Stockholm, 15th] The proposal to create a Scandinavian military alliance has recently gained more support. Swedish military experts, after detailed research, believe that this alliance will be a major factor in preventing the Scandinavian region from being invaded. They also believe that military cooperation between Sweden, Norway, and Denmark can obtain the following benefits: Geographically speaking, the Scandinavian military group extends from the Danish-German coast to the Varanger Fjord in the far north of Norway, with a coastline of 2,200 kilometers. Its depth is 400 kilometers from Songzhiwar in the Gulf of Bothnia in Sweden to Trondheim on the Norwegian coast, and 800 kilometers from Stockholm to Bergen. Within this area, there are winding harbors and many mountains and forests, which are very unfavorable to intruders from the outside. In the event of an invasion, it will be impossible to take it down in one fell swoop, and it will take months to achieve any results. During this period, external assistance to Scandinavia will definitely be able to reach Scandinavia. (2) Experts estimate that the total strength of the Scandinavian group's defense force is one million people, including the Danish and Norwegian militia groups that have experience in underground movements during wartime. As for the sophistication of Swedish military weapons, it is second only to the Soviet Union and Britain in Europe. (3) The air forces of the three countries have approximately 1,000 aircraft, and the navies have approximately 150 warships. (4) In terms of industry and supply, the combined strength of the Scandinavian group is also at the forefront in Europe. Sweden's famous steel mills and arsenals, the shipyards of the three countries, Denmark's automatic light weapons, and the heavy water produced by Norway needed for atomic bombs are all powerful war potentials. (5) The length of the coastline and the excellence of the harbors facilitate the import of raw materials and war supplies, making it difficult for the enemy to cut them off. Strategically speaking, the joint defense of the three countries makes it difficult to cut off Sweden's external transportation. As long as one of Norway and Denmark has not been occupied by the enemy, Sweden can keep its transportation line to the west open. Military experts also pointed out that the Gulf of Bothnia in eastern Sweden, although the soft underbelly of Scandinavia, would require the concentration of a large number of ships to attack from Finland, which is more difficult. An attack from the Baltic Sea will first encounter the obstruction of Gotland Island, which can also have a considerable delaying effect. The most dangerous thing is that the industrial area on the east coast of Sweden is vulnerable to air strikes from the east, and a landing attack may be launched from Denmark across the sea towards southern Sweden. In the former case, the air defense on the east coast must be greatly strengthened. In the latter case, the conclusion of a military alliance between the three countries can enable Sweden and Norway to set up bases in Denmark first to resist enemies from the European continent.</p>
<h3>Radioactive Iodine Has Special Effect on Treating Cancer</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 10th] Strauss, a member of the United States Atomic Energy Commission, revealed today that radioactive iodine can be used to treat cancer, and it is hoped that there will be a cure. Radioactive iodine can be taken internally or injected into the human body, and after concentrating at the affected area, its radiation energy can immediately attack and destroy the infected area, thereby eliminating the source of the disease.</p>
<h3>Jerusalem Declared an Open City Arab League Expresses Rejection Unchanged Stance Against Partition of Holy Land</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] London, 16th Broadcast: Cairo Report, the Foreign Minister of Transjordan announced today that the Arab League has rejected the suggestion made by the United Nations mediator, Bernadotte, to declare Jerusalem an open city, because if this suggestion is accepted, the Arab side would have to give up the positions it previously occupied.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] London, 16th Broadcast: Cairo Report: Arab League Secretary-General Azzam told Bernadotte that the Arab countries will never accept a solution to the Palestine problem based on partition and the establishment of a Jewish state, and other solutions are open for discussion.</p>
<p>[United Press, Cairo, 16th] The results of the preliminary negotiations between United Nations mediator Bernadotte and the Arab authorities may be announced in the next day or two. At the same time, the Israeli Foreign Ministry in Tel Aviv declared last night that the Israeli government has not yet received an invitation to participate in the Rhodes Island Conference and is waiting for Bernadotte to meet with them to decide whether to attend the conference.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Cairo, 15th] Bernadotte is scheduled to leave here for Tel Aviv on the 17th to listen to the Israeli side's opinions and return to Rhodes Island on Friday.</p>
<h3>Soviet Request to Send Observers Rejected by Security Council</h3>
<p>[United Press, Lake Success, 16th] Soviet representative Gromyko requested that the Palestine Truce Supervision Organization should be composed of ten countries, of which the Soviet Union would send five military observers to participate. The Security Council submitted this case for a vote today. Only the Soviet Union and Ukraine voted in favor, and the remaining nine countries abstained, so the case was not passed. The current Palestine Truce Supervision Organization is only composed of military observers from the United States, France, and Belgium.</p>
<h3>US Senate Passes Foreign Aid Bill Most of Reduction Restored Chairman of House Appropriations Committee Expresses Opposition</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] New York, 16th Broadcast: Washington Report: Taber, chairman of the House Appropriations Committee, told the House today that it is reasonable to reduce the foreign aid fund, and that the fund can be effective if it is used properly. He will strongly oppose the Senate's restoration of the $1.175 billion.</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 16th] The Senate passed the $6,125,710,228 foreign aid bill by a vote of 60 to 9 on the morning of the 16th. The bill has been transferred to the House of Representatives so that it can be decided in the meeting before the recess. The Senate passed the amendment of the Senate Appropriations Committee by a vote of 64 to 15, restoring most of the $2,160,000,000 that was cut by the House of Representatives. At the same time, the House of Representatives' passage of extending the use of the fund for fifteen months was also cancelled, and the twelve months recommended by the administrative authorities was restored. The above bill has been transferred to the joint conference committee of the two houses, which is scheduled to begin work this afternoon to correct the differences between the two houses.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 16th] After a lengthy debate, the Senate voted to increase foreign aid funding and returned the bill to the House of Representatives for discussion, which is expected to be opposed by the House of Representatives. The foreign aid funding approved by the Senate has increased significantly in both the Far East and Europe, partly due to raising the number approved by the House of Representatives to $6,125,710,228, and mostly due to the provision for twelve months of use. According to Senate Appropriations Committee Chairman Bridges, the committee voted on the amount of foreign aid funding extremely generously, and this allocation is an adventurous move towards the American faith.</p>
<h3>Strikes and Conflicts in Central France</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Paris, 16th] A clash occurred yesterday between striking workers and police in Clermont-Ferrand, an industrial center in central France, injuring more than 80 people, including several seriously injured.

<h3>Gasoline Panic Intensifies Black Market Supply Not Lacking Price Up to One Million Cars Lining Up for Gas Stretch for Miles Two Public Bus Routes Suspended</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The severity of the oil shortage problem has intensified in recent days. Although oil prices have just been adjusted and the refueling hours of gas stations near the Bund have been re-regulated, the lines of cars lining up to buy oil have increased rather than decreased. From morning to night, they often stretch for miles, greatly affecting traffic order. According to the persons in charge of various gas stations, their average daily supply of oil is generally below 900 gallons, so the actual number of vehicles that can purchase gasoline at each location will definitely not exceed 100 per day. Calculated based on the city's 52 gas stations, only 5,000 vehicles can get the opportunity to refuel each day, while the total number of motor vehicles in the city is more than ten times this number. Therefore, if the amount of oil supplied is not increased, the congestion and chaos will never be improved.</p>
<p>Among the cars lining up to buy oil, commercial vehicles are the most numerous. Taxis and large trucks often drive to various gas stations at midnight to line up and wait, and the drivers sleep in their cars. Therefore, at the first glimmer of dawn, a long line has already formed in front of the gas stations. Although those who arrive later also join the line, the amount of oil is limited and quickly runs out, not only wasting several hours of time but also leading to a dilemma of being unable to move forward or backward, and being extremely embarrassed. At the same time, the supply of black market gasoline is not lacking, but the price is as high as over one million per gallon. Most car owners who cannot find gasoline can only bear the pain and rely on the black market. In fact, the purpose of restricting fuel consumption by tightening quotas has been completely lost. It is said that the city has a large amount of oil reserves, so where does this large amount of black market gasoline flow in from? Furthermore, why doesn't the authorities order each commercial car company in the city to collect its gasoline purchase certificates and apply directly to the oil company for allocation, in order to reduce the congestion at various gas stations? These two points are likely to become a major question in the minds of most citizens.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The city's public transportation company has recently had difficulties in supplying parts and fuel. With the approval of the municipal government, starting today, the shorter and less important Route 7 and Route 2A will be temporarily suspended. They will be restored once the gasoline supply returns to normal. The company has posted notices at the stations of the above two routes to avoid passengers waiting in vain.</p>
<h3>Avoiding Vehicle Congestion: Dividing Gas Station Locations</h3>
<p>Due to vehicles waiting in line at gas stations causing significant traffic obstruction, the authorities, in order to avoid traffic congestion, have divided the gas station locations for small passenger cars and trucks. A trial run will begin on the 18th of this month. The designated locations are as follows: (1) Gas stations for private and commercial passenger cars: (Asia Petroleum) the intersection of Zhongzheng East Road and Sichuan Road, No. 85 Nanjing East Road, and No. 1244 Linsen Middle Road, three locations in total. (Mobil) No. 111 Sichuan Middle Road, the intersection of Zhongzheng East Road and Jinling West Road, and the intersection of Linsen Middle Road and Baoqing Road, three locations in total. (Texaco) One location at Fuzhou Road on Henan Road. (2) Gas stations for trucks: (Asia Petroleum) Datong Road on Beijing West Road, No. 692 Changyang Road, and No. 590 North Sichuan Road, three locations in total. (Mobil) No. 1202 North Sichuan Road, the intersection of West Linsen Road and Huashan Road, and the intersection of Pingliang Road and Yangshupu Road, three locations in total. (Texaco) No. 157 Xizang Road. (3) Other stations can serve both passenger cars and trucks.</p>

<h3>China Merchants Steam Navigation Company Oil Supply Resolved</h3>
<p>The problem of fuel oil for ships of the state-run China Merchants Steam Navigation Company was resolved on the 16th. According to reports, the exchange settlement certificate for the 5,000 tons of diesel oil urgently needed by the company has been entrusted by the Central Bank to the Bank of China for purchase. The value of each US dollar is National Currency $1,145,000 (official exchange rate $474,000, plus an exchange settlement certificate of $671,000). However, the procedures are quite complicated, so the earliest the oil can be collected is the afternoon of the 17th. The Hai Sui, originally scheduled to sail from Shanghai to Xiamen at noon on the 15th, the Linsen, originally scheduled to sail from Shanghai to Guangdong on the morning of the 16th, and the Xilin, originally scheduled to sail from Shanghai to Tianjin on the morning of the 17th, will all be able to set sail on the 18th.</p>
<h3>Prices Begin to Fall: Three Reasons Analyzed</h3>
<p>The prices in Shanghai had been soaring for days, but on the 16th, all prices uniformly began to fall. The reasons for this, after analysis, are as follows: (1) All businesses are busy settling accounts for the half-year, and funds are slightly tight. (2) There are rumors that US aid will be restored to the original plan, and people's minds are more at ease. (3) The police are closely monitoring the market, which has achieved results.</p>
<h3>Cement Factories in Difficult Situation: Guild Discusses Coping Strategies</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] The National Cement Association believes that the current cement factories are facing difficulties. In terms of production, foreign exchange is not approved by the government for packaging paper bags, making it impossible to place orders. In terms of finance, the necessary funds cannot be raised, and the authorities refuse to provide assistance. In terms of sales, the war is raging, and public and private needs are almost at a standstill, and exports are also difficult to promote on a large scale. Due to these three urgent situations, the cement industry is now in a dilemma of being unable to advance or retreat and unable to survive. It is reported that the association has already reported the above difficulties in detail to the Ministry of Economic Affairs, requesting consultation with relevant parties to quickly find a solution. Recently, it will also hold a board meeting to discuss coping strategies.</p>
<h3>Special Relief Donations: Enthusiastic Pledges</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] Since the launch of the Shanghai Special Relief Donation campaign, various trade associations, hometown associations, and individuals have been enthusiastically pledging donations. Many have submitted their pledge lists and amounts to the association, including one person who pledged National Currency 3 billion yuan, but did not wish to disclose their name. Some trade associations that have pledged donations have also requested the fundraising committee not to publicize their names.</p>
<h3>Implementation Measures for Limited-Price Seats in Movie Theaters Announced</h3>

(3) The price of limited-price seats shall be approved and implemented by the Bureau of Social Affairs. (4) If any movie theater reduces the number of limited-price seats or raises prices without authorization, it shall be punished in accordance with the regulations on violating price limits and negotiated prices. (5) Scalpers who rush to buy limited-price tickets shall be severely punished after being caught. If ticket sellers in movie theaters collude with scalpers, they shall be severely punished along with the movie theater after being identified. (6) Limited-price tickets are not allowed to be pre-sold, and patrons must take their seats immediately after purchasing tickets.</p>
<h3>The Public Opinion Survey Committee Will Release 3,000 Dan of Rice Daily Starting Today: Ji Mingzhai States that Off-Site Transactions Have Disappeared</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] The price of rice has been restored to price controls. Mayor Wu rigidly stipulates that the transaction price of rice in the market shall not exceed 9.8 million yuan, and the retail price shall not exceed 10 million yuan. Yesterday, the Public Opinion Survey Committee, together with the Police Bureau, strictly enforced price controls, inspected rice shops, and arrested and sent to the court for handling the responsible persons who marked prices exceeding 10 million yuan.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Public Opinion Survey Committee continued to release 3,000 dan of rice and decided to release 3,000 dan of supply rice daily from today onwards. On Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, it will be released in the North Market, and on Tuesdays, Thursdays, and Saturdays, it will be released in the South Market. In addition, with slightly tighter credit and Wuxi also implementing price controls simultaneously, a large number of economic police were dispatched to monitor the market, and rice prices across the board softened. The South Market invited the authorities to set price limits, and all transactions were completed at 9.8 million yuan. In the North Market, only a few low-grade rice transactions were completed, and the rest had no goods to offer. Yesterday, the goods arrived were very scarce, with a total of 2,848 dan arriving in the North and South Markets.</p>
<p>According to Ji Mingzhai, Director of the Grain Section of the Bureau of Social Affairs, off-site transactions have disappeared. The authorities are determined to suppress the soaring rice prices. Anyone who exceeds the price limit set by the authorities and raises prices without authorization in an attempt to obtain illegal profits will be severely punished after being found out.</p>
<h3>Mao Da Rice Shop Guilty of Malpractice: Suspended from Distribution</h3>
<p>The People's Food Allocation Committee previously received a confidential report from residents of the 55th, 56th, and 57th neighborhoods of Jinjiaqiao Town, Yangjing District, stating that rice shops in the town were deducting quantities and replacing them with inferior rice. The committee immediately sent personnel to investigate and found that the remaining allocation of rice sold by Mao Da Rice Shop should have been 2 dou and 6 sheng, but in fact, the shop's corridor and bedroom contained as much as 9 shi of American top-grade white rice and 3 shi of American second-grade white rice. The owner of the shop claimed that 9 shi was exchanged by ordinary citizens who disliked the coarse rice and were willing to exchange it with the shop, and the remaining 3 shi were deposited by citizens Ma Liushun and others. When asked about the address of the depositors, the shop owner was speechless. Moreover, the 9 shi of top-grade American rice was of extremely good quality and was not coarse rice, so the claim that citizens disliked the coarse rice and voluntarily exchanged it was even more unreliable. The Public Opinion Survey Committee believes that the shop owner Shi Shenggao, as the Baozhang (neighborhood chief), had such malpractices occur, so in addition to suspending the rice distribution, it also sent a letter to the Bureau of Social Affairs to investigate the matter strictly.</p>

<h3>Municipal Council Receives Proposal: Suggests Transferring Foreign Deposits to Reform the Currency System to Strengthen Finance</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] The Municipal Council continued to receive four proposals from various councilors yesterday. The details are as follows: 1. Zhang Zhongyuan, Shao Yongsheng, and others proposed: urgently telegraph the central government to temporarily transfer the funds and deposits of Chinese people fleeing abroad to be used as reserves to immediately reform the currency system, to strengthen finance and reassure the people. The reason for the proposal is: the widespread soaring of prices has broken all previous records and can be called an unprecedented crisis. If measures are not taken to stop it urgently, the national economy will collapse, and the people's hearts in various places will become more and more dissipated. Looking back at the various old and new measures issued by the government to suppress prices, none have been effective. If this continues, the future of the national economy and the people's livelihood will be irreparable. To save the situation, the only way is to reform the currency system as a whole. The method: the government should use its full force to temporarily transfer all private deposits of this country in the United States and funds fleeing abroad to be used as reserves for currency reform and implement it immediately. Zhang and others also requested that the proposal be listed as an urgent proposal and submitted for discussion on the opening day. 2. Pan Jemei and others proposed: to request the Bureau of Public Works to transfer the stones piled up on Tianmu Road to expedite the repair of North Shanxi Road, North Zhejiang Road, and North Xizang Road to facilitate transportation. 3. Pan Jemei and others proposed: to request the local garrison command to strictly prohibit honorary soldiers from demanding money in disguise to maintain military discipline. 4. Zhang Zhongyuan and others proposed: to cancel the restriction on the transfer of cars.</p>
<h3>US Consul in Shanghai Transferred Back to Washington</h3>

<h3>War Instigator? Chennault Issues Statement Refuting Moscow Radio</h3>
<p>General Chennault, General Manager of the Civil Air Transport, held a reception for Chinese and foreign reporters in this city at the Civil Air Transport headquarters at No. 17 The Bund at 10:00 yesterday morning. He issued a written statement in response to the report from the United Press in London on the 13th that he was a "war instigator." The translation is as follows:</p>
<p>"Recently, Moscow Radio and Communist radio commentator Katayev accused Generals Kenney and Lee Liman and myself of being war instigators. Since they are in the habit of publishing false news by distorting facts, I originally did not want to pay attention to the absurd propaganda of the Communists. However, because I am deeply concerned about promoting world peace, I cannot but express my views to the people of anti-Communist countries. I know that my words will never be published in the Communist countries, so it is impossible for me to express my position to the enslaved people of these countries.</p>
<p>When I was invited to attend the House Foreign Affairs Committee to express my views on world peace and aid to China, I used a large map to illustrate that the world has now formed a small world, and that any accident that occurs in one area of this small world will inevitably affect other areas to some extent. I expressed that if the Communist forces continue to expand in China and the Soviet Union fails to abide by the treaty it signed with China in 1945, a third world war will inevitably be triggered. I pointed out with this map that if the Soviet Union's aggression leads to another world war, certain areas may be used as bombing bases.</p>
<p>Although I have served in two world wars, I am not a military man. In the two world wars, I fought to maintain certain principles. These principles are the foundation on which our government was built. I firmly believe that people always have freedom and believe that all people should have security, whether domestically or internationally. To maintain this principle, I am willing to participate in the war again if necessary.</p>
<p>I do not believe that war is a necessary action to solve political and economic problems. War can hardly solve any problems, whether these problems belong to the past or the future. The only necessity of war lies in stopping those who attempt to conquer the world and enslave all mankind. History shows us that there have been many such people in the past. To name a few, William Kaiser, Hitler, Mussolini, and Tojo Hideki are all examples. History will eventually show us the complete record of Stalin and his party members. This is the only group in today's world that attempts to conquer other people by force.</p>
<p>War instigators use all the resources of the country to prepare for war. The only war instigators in the world today are a group of people living in the Kremlin. They spend all their time studying ways and methods to communize the world. All peace-loving people will unite with me and hope that these madmen will never launch their massive land and air forces to attack the peaceful world."</p>

<h3>Municipal Government's Second Inquiry of Jiaotong University Has Been Answered: President Cheng Declares Difference in Standpoint from Municipal Government</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] Jiaotong University President Cheng Xiaogang has issued a response to Mayor Wu's second inquiry regarding the June 5th student anti-Japan parade incident, due to the Municipal Government's urging for an early reply. Some points require further investigation before a response can be made. President Cheng stated that the school's position in handling this incident differs from that of the Municipal Government. He cited an ancient saying to illustrate the school's position as "guiding with virtue and regulating with etiquette," while the Municipal Government's position is "guiding with politics and regulating with punishment," so differences in opinion are inevitable. He does not understand why the Municipal Government has repeatedly inquired of Jiaotong University. Although some graduates participated in the parade that day, they were prevented from leaving the school. He believes that if the mayor also conducts investigations in other schools, the truth may be easier to understand.</p>
<h3>Ban on Trafficking and Sale of Weapon and Ammunition Waste and Parts</h3>

<h3>Major Theft at Mexican Ambassador's Residence: Not All Stolen Goods Recovered, Two Suspects Detained and Interrogated</h3>

<h3>Thirty-Eight Business Associations Telegraph Request to Abolish Property Tax</h3>
<p>Thirty-eight business associations in this city, including those representing shipowners, cotton cloth merchants, silk merchants, paper merchants, warehouse operators, insurance companies, oil and fat producers, customs brokers and transporters, woolen fabric merchants, motor vehicle transporters, oil merchants, grain merchants, wine merchants, foil merchants, gold paper and sundry goods merchants, rubber merchants, restaurants, ham merchants, porcelain merchants, department stores, electrical appliance merchants, new medicine merchants, dental equipment merchants, southern goods merchants, automobile parts merchants, bicycle merchants, rice merchants, yarn merchants, booksellers, Western-style clothing merchants, vegetables merchants, scissors merchants, rayon merchants, imported wine and canned goods merchants, biscuit, bread, and candy merchants, lumber merchants, iron merchants, and inland shipping companies, have telegraphed the Legislative Yuan regarding the proposed property tax, requesting its abolition. The telegram stated in brief: The land, its fixtures, houses, their equipment, motor vehicles, ships, goods, and other assets of all industrial and commercial enterprises are merely tools for operational turnover, providing revenue for the nation and livelihoods for the people. If these assets, including both movable and immovable property, are valued and taxed at rates ranging from five to sixty percent, while financial institutions are prohibited from mortgaging machinery, land, and buildings, the only assets available for liquidation are raw materials and finished products. If factories and stores are forced to exhaust all their assets to pay taxes according to the law, how can they continue production and operation? This so-called property tax is nothing short of a death warrant for industry and commerce. Its implementation will inevitably lead to national bankruptcy and widespread unrest. This matter is not merely a superficial concern but a matter of life and death for our associations.</p>

<h3>Central Bank Dispatches Personnel to Beijing and Tianjin to Prevent Outflow of Fluid Capital from North China; Crackdown on Black Market in Gold and Currency Intensified Yesterday</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Financial authorities have determined that the recent surge in prices in this city is due to the machinations of fluid capital from North China. The redemption of currency circulating in the Northeast has flooded North China with fluid capital. The high exchange rate between North China and Shanghai has caused fluid capital from North China to flow south in various ways, estimated to reach over 1 trillion National Currency per day. Under these circumstances, the price surge in this city is unprecedented, and the once effective remedies of tightening credit and selling goods to lower prices have proven ineffective. It is now learned that the authorities, in order to address the root cause, have decided to start by preventing the outflow of fluid capital from North China. Wang Zhong, Commissioner of the Northeast Region of the Central Bank, has been summoned to Shanghai to report on the financial situation in the Northeast and North China. Senior officials of the Central Bank have also repeatedly consulted to devise countermeasures and have decided to first dispatch Li Lixia, Xia Jin, Xiong Yuzhong, and others to Beijing and Tianjin in the coming days to strictly monitor and restrict the carrying of cash and remittances, in order to reduce the outflow of funds from the area. Several other plans will be implemented after Yu Hongjun returns to Shanghai from Nanjing. The crackdown on black market transactions in gold and currency in this city began yesterday and is being enforced extremely strictly. Violators will be severely punished regardless of background. The management, price control, and sale of food are also being implemented through a two-pronged approach. In addition, the first batch of U.S. aid supplies is expected to arrive on the 18th, which has already affected market psychology. It is expected that the price surge in June will soon come to an end.</p>
<h3>After Implementation of Price Controls, Top-Quality Rice Disappears from Market; Off-Exchange Bidding Remains High</h3>
<p>Rice prices were controlled starting yesterday. The maximum transaction price on the market was not allowed to exceed 9.8 million, and the retail price was not allowed to exceed 10 million. However, as the cost of transporting rice from the production areas to Shanghai exceeded the price control limit, merchants could not sell at a loss and therefore did not sell. Top-quality rice disappeared from the market, and only second-grade indica rice was traded at the controlled price. In the northern market, White Yuan reached 10.08 million, and Shadow Yuan reached 10.02 million, an increase of 500,000 compared to the previous day. Some sellers also offered Shadow Yuan and early rice together, with the early rice at the controlled price, and the price of Shadow Yuan increased to compensate for the insufficient price of early rice. Off-exchange prices continued to be high, with Wuxi prices reaching 11.4 million, and bids being as high as 200,000 to 300,000 higher. Medium-grade white japonica rice was at 10.5 million, and top-grade white japonica rice reached 11.1 million, but there were no transactions. High-quality thin rice was at 10.08 million, with very few transactions. Later, due to the decline in other commodities in the non-agricultural sector, it became softer, and the arrival of goods decreased even more. The volume of trade in the two markets was 648 shi.</p>
<h3>Flour, Grain, and Oilseed Cakes Decline</h3>
<p>Flour prices plummeted as before, mainly because the prices of all commodities fell, and merchants were competing to sell at high prices first. Furthermore, credit was slightly tight, and demand weakened sharply. A few early sales still stood at high prices. Old car flour fell from 3.51 million directly to 3.31 million. Warship flour opened at 2.45 million and later fell to 3.3 million due to the selling pressure, a decrease of 200,000 each. Jiancheng and Hongfeng flour fell by more than 200,000 each, bran fell by 200,000, and wheat remained unchanged at 4.7 million.</p>
<p>Grain prices uniformly fell from their peak. Soybeans fell by 300,000. Wuhan soybeans closed at 5.6 million. Mung beans were difficult to sell, and prices fell by 300,000 to 400,000. Corn sales exceeded imports, and prices fell by 200,000 in the end. Red sorghum was not in demand and did not open, with asking prices 200,000 to 300,000 lower. New silkworms and new Yuan wheat each fell by 200,000 to 300,000. Sha Chi was at 10.5 million, down 1.5 million. Sesame declined by 500,000, and raw peanuts fell by 1 million.</p>
<p>Edible oil prices experienced a sharp decline. Soybean oil initially stood at 22.7 million, but closed at 22 million. Dachang new soybean oil was at 21.9 million, a decrease of 2.4 million each, a drop of up to 10%. Due to the small amount of stock, there were not many sellers of crude oil, and it only fell slightly by 500,000. Small car sesame oil fell by 1.3 million, vegetable oil fell by 2 million, and soybean cake fell by 200,000 amid frequent dumping by retail investors.</p>
<h3>Market Conditions in Various Regions</h3>
<p>Wuxi [Report from Our Newspaper in Wuxi on the 16th] The price surge has begun to subside. The county government continues to mobilize forces to monitor the market and has ordered self-defense forces to be stationed with armed guards in front of rice shops to prevent rice grabbing.

<p>Lanzhou [Report from Our Newspaper in Lanzhou on the 16th] All banks and Zhuang in Lanzhou have been ordered to tighten credit, and commercial loans are extremely tight.

The market eased this morning, with the price of cloth averaging a decrease of 2 million, and cigarettes decreased by 200,000 per dan.</p>
<h3>Tea Market Turns from High to Stable</h3>
<p>The tea market yesterday turned from rising to stable. The reason for this is the relationship between tight credit and falling prices of all commodities, which caused the sentiment to dissipate. Merchants gradually felt powerless to continue to raise prices. At the close, prices generally moved sideways. Domestic tea sales remained active, with local streets and rural villages absorbing supplies. As for export varieties, the attitude of exporters was hesitant, making it difficult for trading to be clear.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market Begins to Decline</h3>
<p>The sugar market yesterday saw a rare decline due to the release of the third batch of special allocation sugar. Four-and-a-half white sugar, being the target of the special allocation, fell to 14.8 million in the spot market, 3 million less than the closing price of the previous day, and other varieties followed suit. Current crude sugar was at 860,000, and 24 medium sugar was at 880,000.</p>
<p>The initial price of 25th-period crude white was 13.5 million, later 4.1 million, slightly tighter than the closing price of the previous day. A total of 28,550 packages of third-period specially allocated four-and-a-half white sugar were offered, priced at 14.5 million, plus a donation of 230,000. The initial price offered by fellow traders was 14.7 million, later 5 million.</p>
<p>Domestic sugar unanimously softened. The asking price for Shantou Qing was 890,000, with no transactions. Diao Qing was at 400,000, and Xinghua White was at 1 million. The decline was similar to that of red sugar, with no significant difference in cotton red sugar.</p>
<h3>Special Grade Refined White Sugar Quoted and Sold</h3>
<p>After the Taiwan Sugar Corporation quoted and sold special grade refined white sugar yesterday, a total of 525 entities, accounting for 52,100 packages, applied, and 233 entities, accounting for 28,550 packages (120 jin per package), were approved. The price was 14.5 million per dan. As a result, the market price of special grade refined white sugar fell to 15.2 million per dan yesterday morning. The highest peak price had risen to 18 million.</p>
<h3>Bank Bureau Revises Internal Exchange Rates</h3>
<p>The internal exchange rates of the Four Banks, Two Bureaus, and One Treasury will be revised as follows from the 17th: Xiamen 120 yuan, Guangzhou 150 yuan, Shantou 160 yuan, Haikou 160 yuan, Wuzhou and Nanning 80 yuan each, Changsha 50 yuan, Wuhan 0 yuan each, Nanchang 30 yuan, Jingdezhen 50 yuan, Jiujiang 35 yuan, Ji'an 45 yuan, Ganzhou 50 yuan, and Chongqing 10 yuan.</p>
<h3>Collateralized Loan Case Discussed by Loan Factory Advisory Committee</h3>
<p>The Industrial and Mining Advisory Committee of the National Bank's Loan Committee held its tenth meeting on the 15th, chaired by Zhang Zi, to discuss eleven cases of collateralized National Policy Loans and ten cases of collateralized Business Loans, all of which were sent to the eighth meeting of the Loan Committee next Monday for approval. Except for National Policy Loan cases, which must be sent to the Four Joint Head Offices for final approval, Business Loan collateralized cases can be handled by the applying banks and Zhuang with the Business Bureau at any time when credit is tight after approval by the Loan Committee. The collateralized interest rate is still set at 8 yuan per thousand yuan per day.</p>
<h3>Frequent News of Sales; Cotton Yarn and Cloth Experience Sharp Rise and Rapid Decline; Blue Phoenix Fine Yarn Falls by 80 Million Compared to Previous Day</h3>
<p>Yesterday's cotton yarn market saw continuous sharp increases and prices standing at a peak, causing anxiety. In addition, credit among fellow traders was tight, and more sought to sell for profit, causing buyer demand to weaken.</p>
<p>Forty-two count Blue Phoenix fine yarn opened in the morning, and the market immediately fell by 40 to 50 million because the yarn management committee allocated more fine yarn. Later, it was heard that the cloth market had declined, and the interest in the street weakened, causing the market to fall further to close at 510 million, a decrease of 80 million compared to the previous day. Other counts of coarse and fine yarn also fell by varying amounts from 30 to 40 million to 80 to 90 million.</p>
<p>Yesterday's cotton cloth market saw a sudden tightening of credit and various unfavorable news spreading, causing a sudden sense of weakness. Twelve-pound Dragon Head fine cloth immediately fell by 400,000. Later, due to selling pressure from the street and from Hankou, Shanxi, Tianjin, and other regions, the market fell all the way to 10.25 million with sales. Near the close, profits from floating accounts were used to offset losses, and the price rose back to 10.4 million, a sharp drop of 1 million compared to the previous day. Other medium and lower-grade fine cloth and fine twill also declined, but Yuan cloth and Shilin cloth remained strong.</p>
<h3>Silk Declines</h3>
<p>The artificial silk market dropped sharply in the morning yesterday and rebounded in the afternoon, but still ended up lower by 23 million compared to the previous day. 120 count Jin San Ma bright silk opened at 592 million in the morning, once rose to 960 million in transactions, and then fell. The morning closing price fell to 70 million, and the opening price in the afternoon fell further to 650 million. However, due to bargain hunting from various parties, the market gradually rose again, with the highest bid reaching 900 million. Finally, it fell again to 820 million. 120 count Sinia C bright silk was about 30 million lower than Jin San Ma.</p>
<p>The raw silk market declined yesterday. Grade C traded at 770 million, Grade D opened at 60 million, and Grade E had transactions at 50 million in the morning, all falling by about 30 million compared to the previous day's price. Gao Lingzu was priced similarly to Grade E. Qian Jing was strong yesterday because domestic silk was expensive and costs increased, but there were no transactions.</p>
<p>The silk fabric market was uniformly weak yesterday morning. Zhen Silk quilt cover Huaqiang goods opened at 302 million in the morning, once rose to 505 million immediately, and then fell back. The closing price immediately fell to 292 million. The Da Cheng order for plaid crepe, which had been selling well recently, was priced the same as the previous day, but there were no transactions.</p>
<h3>Woolen Fabrics Stable</h3>
<p>The woolen fabric market remained stable throughout yesterday, presenting a situation of internal weakness and external strength. Except for Wanli top plies and other summer goods, which were slightly weaker due to the end of the peak sales season and the relationship between the China Trust Bureau's auction, the rest all had gains and no losses.</p>
<h3>Old Buyers Divest, Sentiment Dissipates; Shanghai Stock Market Declines; Government Bonds Surge to New Highs</h3>
<p>The Shanghai stock market yesterday lost its external protection and collapsed due to excessive inventory, resulting in a very tragic decline. Except for domestic new shares, which rose to the limit, all other stocks suffered losses. The National Bank stopped lending and hesitated to enter the market.</p>
<p>The morning initially stabilized. Yong Yarn entered the market at 3880 yuan, rose from 3890 yuan, and was sold to 3800 yuan. It then rose to 3835 yuan, and the agency fee opened high at 34 yuan and 38 yuan. Credit was already tight, and commodity prices fell, gradually declining. It broke the 3700 yuan mark. Although there was a small rise in the middle, it was inevitable that more floating accounts would collapse near noon and sell to 3655 yuan. The noon closing price was 3665 yuan. Except for domestic new shares, which consistently rose to the limit, other stocks unanimously fell sharply by 5% to 10%, except for Xinyi, which did not fall much.</p>
<p>In the afternoon market, Yong Yarn entered the market at 3700 yuan, was first sold to 3675 yuan, then rose to 3780 yuan, and then retreated to 3745 yuan. The National Bank only entered a little over 100 billion, and 213 and other stocks entered, which rose to 3800 yuan. Hearing the news that the National Bank had stopped lending, it retreated to close at 3725 yuan. Compared to the morning close, Xinyi Datong was still stable, while the rest slightly rose. Among the off-market stocks, the world continued to rise, while the rest slightly recovered.</p>
<p>Government bonds surged again yesterday, and new highs were seen. Unified C opened at 570,000, rose to 750,000, and finally struggled around the 600,000 mark. Compared to the previous close, A, B, D, and E each rose by 100,005, Unified C jumped by 115,000, and the turnover was about 4 million.</p>
<p>Foreign stocks also declined yesterday due to a lack of external impetus. The police were still monitoring, inevitably hindering progress. Yi Yarn opened at 6.4 million in the morning, retreated to 6.15 million, and then hovered around 6.2 million. Foreign firms bought, and banks and securities firms sold. Compared to the previous close, Yi Yarn, English Union, Jardine Matheson, Yi Beer, and Shipping fell by 5%, and Ye Guang, Paper Edition, and Steel each fell by less than 10%.</p>

Our Ministry of Education has issued an order to all public and private colleges and universities with art departments across the country, as well as education departments and bureaus in various provinces and cities, and has sent a letter to the Chinese Artists Association to encourage art students and staff to participate in this competition. The main points of the method are as follows: (1) The theme of the 1948 United Nations Color Poster Competition is to promote social progress and better living standards among the six major freedoms according to the Charter. (2) The competition work in China is the responsibility of the United Nations Office in Shanghai, which is currently hiring experts to form a committee to select three of the posters participating in the competition from our country and submit them to the United Nations Department of Public Information for the International Judging Committee to determine the best works. (3) Participants are limited to professional artists, and each participant can submit one work. (4) The work should be 24 inches high and 18 inches wide, and no more than six colors can be used, including the lettering. It should be sent to the United Nations Office in Shanghai, 106 Huangpu Road, before September 1, 1948. Works that do not meet the size requirements will not be accepted. (5) The prize money is US$1,500 for first place, US$1,000 for second place, and US$500 for third place. There are ten honorary awards, each worth US$100. (6) The copyright and printing rights of the winning posters belong to the United Nations; the rejected works will be returned. However, after the winning works have been determined, outstanding but non-winning works will be selected and retained for a certain period for exhibition for publicity purposes only, and will not be printed without the author's consent. (7) The poster should include a concise slogan, the meaning of which should be consistent with the theme. The number of words should be small and should not be embedded in the important parts of the screen, as it needs to be translated into various other languages. (8) The selection of posters is based on artistic achievement and depth of meaning. Attention should be paid to ensuring that the symbols in the paintings can be understood by people all over the world and should not be biased towards the customs of one country or part of the countries. For example, the white dove is not regarded as a symbol of peace by people all over the world, and the winning posters from last year should not be imitated. (According to the winning prize of the first class last year, a few hands are holding a sapling, and the leaves are the national flags of the member states of the United Nations.)

<h3>Councilor Liu Comments on the Standards for the Establishment of Private Schools</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper in Nanjing on the 16th] Because of reports that six representatives of unregistered private schools in Beijing City felt that it was very difficult to handle the establishment of the case due to the Ministry of Education's order to increase the opening and operating expenses of private schools, they specifically went to the Legislative Yuan to petition, provide opinions on revising the regulations on private schools, and ask the Legislative Yuan to notify the Ministry of Education to order the Beijing Education Bureau to exempt them from being banned. Liu Yingshi, a councilor of the Ministry of Education, specifically issued a statement saying that the purpose of the regulations on the opening and operating costs of private schools is to ensure that the school buildings and equipment of private schools, as well as the welfare of staff and students, can maintain a considerable level, which is completely different in nature from the price increases of state-owned enterprises. He also said that the Ministry of Education has always encouraged private schools, but they must have a minimum foundation before they can be established. The formulation of the standards for the establishment of private schools is precisely to protect the development of private schools and is not intended to be suppressed.</p>

<h3>Refusal to Fly Abroad on China National Aviation Corporation (CNAC) Plane: Statement from the World Games Delegation</h3>
<p>The 14th World Games will open at the end of July in England. Our country's delegation is preparing to depart for the event. In today's difficult political and economic situation in our country, it is truly commendable that our World Games delegation can go abroad and participate in the Games as scheduled. The government's efforts are also deeply appreciated.</p>
<p>Everything about this World Games delegation's trip abroad is good, but there is one thing that is very puzzling and regrettable: the delegation is not flying on a domestic plane but on a foreign plane. Although the delegation's spokesperson has made statements, they are distorting the facts.</p>
<p>First, the Northwest Airlines of the United States, which the delegation has booked, does not have a global route. The company's route only goes as far west as Shanghai and as far east as New York. The length of the route is not even as long as that of the China National Aviation Corporation (CNAC). In addition to the Sino-US route, CNAC also has a route from Shanghai to India. Currently, no airline can handle a global route on its own. The World Games delegation's trip abroad will in fact require transfers between several airlines; it is impossible to fly on one airline.</p>
<p>Second, the spokesperson for the delegation claimed that our country's planes are bought from abroad, so even flying on a Chinese company's plane would not be thorough enough. This is clearly confusing the aviation industry with the air transport industry. To give a simple example: France and the Netherlands are very active in the international air transport industry. Their Air France and KLM Royal Dutch Airlines have achieved great success, with routes all over the world, but in fact, the planes used by both major companies are bought from the United States. Does this mean that France and the Netherlands cannot have an air transport industry?</p>
<p>CNAC has prepared to offer preferential treatment to the World Games delegation this time. However, the fact is that all the seats on CNAC's future flights from Shanghai to the United States have been sold out. The reason for the strong push is simply to fight for national dignity and win glory for the Chinese people. Now that the delegation has refused to fly on a China National Aviation Corporation (CNAC) plane, there must be something difficult to say.</p>
<p>As for the claim that the delegation members want to tour New York, CNAC has promised to telegraph local overseas Chinese associations and consulates to arrange hospitality and welcome. CNAC and Pan American World Airways are sister companies, and their coordination and hospitality along the way will certainly not be worse than those of any other company.</p>
<p>Of course, reservations can be canceled. Moreover, the World Games delegation has booked seats on a foreign airline's flights from Shanghai to San Francisco in early July, which is still more than twenty days away. Canceling these seats and switching to CNAC flights would not be a problem at all. The problem lies in whether the delegation is willing to do so.</p>
<p>I remember a story, and I will use it to end this article: One day, a neighbor asked Smith to borrow an ax. Smith told him that he could not lend the ax because he needed it to chop vegetables. Later, Mrs. Smith asked, "Why did you use that reason to refuse the person?" Smith said, "You are so naive. When you intend to refuse something, you can give any reason; there is no need to bother studying it!" (Gu Qixing)</p>

<h3>Talking About Concordance</h3>
<p>— Ge Zhaotong</p>
<p>A concordance, also known as a word index, is the most complete form of index. The word "concordance" originally meant "harmony" or "agreement" in Latin, and later gradually evolved to mean concordance. Concordance is different from the general index at the back of a book. The indexes attached to the back of ordinary books are all key word indexes. A concordance is an arrangement of every word or phrase in a book, using the radical method, the stroke method, or the classification method, with clear numbers indicating its source in the original book, and accompanied by the original sentence for reference and checking. For example, the Mao Shi Yin De (Index to the Book of Odes) of the Indexing Office of Yenching University is an excellent concordance. If we want to find which page, chapter, and section a certain sentence in the Book of Odes comes from, we only need to remember one word in the poem. For example, to find the sentence "Zhong Gu Yue Zhi" (bells and drums are played for pleasure) on which page, chapter, and section it comes from, we can find the following entry using the word "Zhong" (bell), "Yue" (pleasure), or "Zhi": "Zhong Gu Yue Zhi 1/1/5," which means that this sentence appears on the first page, first chapter, fifth section of the scripture.</p>
<p>Concordances were initially mostly used in the Bible, and later also widely used in literature. The earliest motivation for compiling a Bible concordance was that many parts of the Bible, all revealed by God, were in agreement with each other and had to be recorded for comparison. Saint Anthony of Padua is generally considered to be the first person to compile a concordance, but the person who actually compiled a Bible concordance is Bishop Hugo. He wanted to annotate the Bible and felt the need to compile a concordance, so he compiled a Bible concordance. Bible concordances have made great contributions to classical scholars, philologists, historians, and religious scholars in reading the Bible.</p>
<p>After the Bible concordance was published, scholars began to compile literary concordances in the same way. To date, many literary concordances have been compiled. From the ancient Propan Tas, Virgil, Horace, to Shelley, Spencer, Goethe, Herstriot, Panhens, Keats, Kilbermoth, Macaulay, Newman and other famous literary works have been compiled with concordances. Scholars find it very convenient to use. The first Shakespeare concordance was compiled by Ascott in 1790, and the standard edition compiled by Mrs. Clarke was published in London in 1845; Butler published a better Shakespeare concordance in New York in 1894. The Milton concordance was published in Madras in 1856. The Tennyson concordance was published in London in 1870. Feis's Dante concordance was published in Kingston in 1889. The Chaucer Society of London published the Chaucer concordance in 1872. Abbott published the Pope concordance in 1875. Nevill published the Cooper poetry concordance in 1887. Cook published the Crow concordance in 1909. Pearce published the Dickens concordance in 1898. Molinieux published the Browning concordance in New York in 1896. The author lists the concordances compiled in European and American countries to prove how much European and American countries value academic data and how meticulous they are in research methods.</p>
<p>The work of compiling concordances in our country's academic circles is just in its infancy. Among the famous works compiled into concordances, there are only Ye Shaojun's Thirteen Classics Index, Zhouyi Yin De (Index to the Book of Changes) of the Indexing Office of Yenching University, Mao Shi Yin De (Index to the Book of Odes), Chunqiu Jingzhuan Yin De (Index to the Spring and Autumn Annals and Commentaries), Erya Yin De (Index to the Erya), Mengzi Yin De (Index to the Mencius), Lunyu Yin De (Index to the Analects), Du Shi Yin De (Index to Du Fu's Poetry) (Japanese Iijima Tadao and Fukuda Fukuichiro also compiled a Du Shi Index, which indexes by the last word of each sentence, but it is not widely used), He Lixian's Bible Classification (published by Shanghai Puyi Book Society, which compiles sentences with the same word in the Bible into one category and arranges them according to the number of strokes, as an index) and so on. The Indexing Office of Yenching University also has a Liji Yin De (Index to the Book of Rites), which is between a key word index and a concordance, because the function words or conjunctions in the original book are all omitted. The so-called pure concordance should also arrange function words and conjunctions. From this, it can be seen that the work of compiling concordances is still a pioneering work in our country. Not only are there very few books compiled into concordances, but there are also not many scholars who know and use concordances. This is because it is still unfamiliar in China. Therefore, we should vigorously promote the compilation and use of concordances, so that scholars have the opportunity to thoroughly examine the important books of ancient and modern times and delve into the contents of various subjects. This saves scholars a lot of time and energy in their studies, and the benefits are also great.</p>
<h3>Atomic Bombardment and the Atomic Bomb</h3>
<p>— Wang Qande</p>
<p>Original by John K. Robertson, translated by Wen Shengchang, published by World Book Company</p>
<p>Since the invention of atomic weapons and the continuous research on the industrial application of atomic energy, human attention to atomic energy has become more and more intense and more frightening. The recent invention of the American atomic radiation cloud has added another fear of death to human life.</p>
<p>However, these atomic bombs and atomic radiation are all caused by atomic nuclei and neutrons (Nevtron) - an uncharged particle that is the central molecule that constitutes the atomic nucleus - playing tricks there. The atomic nucleus is like a magician, changing this way for a while and changing that way again. In this ever-changing process, it releases the so-called "Atomic Energy," and this released atomic energy has killed countless people, but conversely, it has saved countless victims, because if it were not for the atomic bomb, the Second World War would probably not have ended today!</p>
<p>"Atomic Bombardment and the Atomic Bomb," originally titled Atomic Artillery and the Atomic Bomb, is written in popular language and answers questions raised by the general public. The arrangement is also organized, divided into fourteen chapters, from the latest "Matter is composed of particles" to "The Atomic Bomb." Wherever possible, the author uses ordinary words to replace specialized terms, and sometimes there are some interesting titles in the book, which are all wonderful ways to make readers interested.</p>
<p>In the process of the atomic bomb explosion, the most important thing is of course the "atomic projectile." The so-called atomic projectile is just like the gunpowder in an ordinary bomb. If there is no gunpowder, the bomb cannot explode. Similarly, in an atomic bomb, if there is no projectile, the enormous atomic energy cannot be released.</p>
<p>The electron is the lightest projectile and also the earliest discovered basic particle - because the atoms of every element have electrons rotating around the atomic nucleus, just like the earth revolving around the sun in the solar system - but the mass of the electron is too light, and it does not leave any damage when it passes through thin metal sheets, so it is not suitable. These are introduced very clearly in Chapter Three.</p>
<p>Chapter Four, "A Heavier Projectile: Positive Rays." First, it talks about the discovery of positive rays, and then introduces the proton (Proto). Although the proton is not a very suitable particle, it is much better than the electron. The most brilliant part of this chapter is the "interconversion of mass and energy," which introduces Einstein's law and gives an example. This example is not like general esoteric theories, but allows people to thoroughly understand the great significance of Einstein's definition when they read it. The book writes, "...According to the law derived from his theory of relativity (1) When the energy of an object increases, its mass also increases. (2) Every secret form of energy is equivalent to a certain mass." This is also E=MC2. In this formula, E represents energy, m represents the mass of an object, and C2 represents the square of the speed of light. This chapter is also the most brilliant chapter in the whole book, because "relativity" is the center of modern thought, just like Newton's law of universal gravitation before. If Einstein's equation can be widely applied one day, then human happiness will be truly shallow, just like the book says "...Then the energy obtained from destroying an ounce of coal can provide the electricity needed by 250,000 people for a year."</p>
<p>"No mass of matter," the title of this sixth child seems very strange, but it is not. It is just introducing the text of photon Pboton, because "In free space, sometimes light must also be regarded as a small ball of concentrated energy, which is today called a photon. A photon is a particle, or a radiating particle, that has a certain amount of energy and travels in space at a speed of 186,000 miles per second (i.e., the speed of light)."</p>
<p>"Manufacturing Giant Cannons for Bombarding Atoms" is the theme of Chapter Eight. Just like we want to fire bullets of various sizes, we have to use various weapons, such as field guns, mortars, and long-range cannons. Similarly, atomic giant cannons also have several different forms, such as the Van de Groaff electrostatic accelerator and the Cyclotron invented by Professor Lawrence. These are two extremely important tools, and the book has detailed descriptions of these two tools.</p>
<p>"Nuclear Fission and Serial Reaction" can be said to be the most important page in the study of the atomic bomb, because if the nucleus cannot be split, the success of the atomic bomb is undoubtedly a fantasy. Furthermore, if the chain is impossible, in other words, the atomic bomb cannot have such a great salty power, which is the theme of Chapter Thirteen.</p>
<p>The last chapter, which is Chapter Fourteen, talks about the "Atomic Bomb," and incidentally talks about a new element, plutonium, and the manufacturing plants in this regard, but this chapter does not talk about much material, because the atomic bomb itself is fundamentally a military secret, and the US government restricts its publication, so this of course cannot be said to be a shortcoming of the book.</p>
<p>The rest, such as "Cosmic Rays," "Modern Alchemy," "The Structure of the Atomic Nucleus," etc., have also read a lot, and what is even more brilliant is the appendix, which has many valuable photos that are difficult to find in ordinary books, and the printing is also quite clear.</p>
<p>Therefore, anyone who needs to understand the truth about the "Atomic Age" must read this book.</p>
<h3>100 Tables for Practical Use of Spoken English</h3>
<p>— Zhu Fang</p>
<p>Written by Harold E. Palmer</p>
<p>Translated and compiled by Zhang Peilin</p>
<p>Published by Kaiming Bookstore</p>
<p>Before introducing the contents of this book, I should repeat the author's explanation of "practical use": "Replacing any word in any fixed sentence (Authentic sentence) with another word with the same grammatical structure and similar meaning can produce countless new sentences. This method is called practical use (Substitution)."</p>
<p>This book is compiled based on this method, and each table can produce at least 100 or more sentences, and the most can reach 60,000 to 70,000 or even more than 100,000 sentences. Therefore, it is not easy to compile this kind of book, and it must make each sentence as applicable as possible.</p>
<p>In addition, the compiler has also added a "chapter vocabulary," a "vocabulary index," and a "verb table," which are indeed quite helpful for self-learners.</p>
<p>If you read this book carefully, you will definitely get a lot of benefits in terms of listening and reading, because there is a phonetic table of international sound numbers in front of each table, and his phonetic transcription is not individual, but based on the principle of organizational elements in the sentence. The (Linking) of each sentence's pronunciation and the elimination of fast reading are also noted.</p>
<p>If you are a student who wants to make progress in listening and speaking, I advise him to buy it and read it quickly. At present, this is a rare book.</p>
<h3>Reading "Fundamental Education"</h3>
<p>— Erli</p>
<p>Edited by the UNESCO, translated by Wang Chengxu, published by Commercial Press</p>
<p>The first volume of this book was published in September last year, just when the Far East Regional Conference on Fundamental Education was held in Nanjing, and the second volume was published in March of this year. The people of the country can therefore get a glimpse of the whole picture of this classic in the world's fundamental education movement. This book can be said to be a collective creation, written by dozens of experts and scholars in the field of fundamental education in the world, and then compiled into this book by the special editorial committee of the education group of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization. Therefore, in terms of content, it is rich and consistent, and worth reading carefully.</p>
<p>The greatest value of this book is that readers can read articles by many experts in these two small volumes. Most of these articles are incorporated into this book in whole or in part of the original text. The record of the current situation of fundamental education in various countries in the first volume is compiled from the reports of experts on education in the relevant countries. For example, the fundamental education of the Soviet Union was written by Mrs. Kim, who has published several specialized books on Soviet education; the fundamental education of the French colonies was written by Mr. Chatton, a supervisor of the French government's colonial department; the fundamental education of India was written by Mr. Chitre Singh, the editor of the Indian Adult Education Magazine; the fundamental education of Mexico was written by Ms. Torres, who worked in the Mexican rural education and cultural mission. As for the contents of the second volume, they are even more exciting. American anthropologist Ms. Mitt wrote an article on fundamental education and cultural values, proposing that fundamental education should preserve the cultures of all ethnic groups, and suggesting that China should express its own views on education at the World Education Conference. Ms. Reed, Associate Professor of Education at the University of London, UK, wrote an article on the goals of fundamental education, analyzing several important concepts in fundamental education, and proposing a philosophical basis for fundamental education. Professor Kandel, an American expert in comparative education, wrote an article on literacy and beyond, explaining that literacy is not the ultimate goal of fundamental education. Many acts of aggression in the world are committed by so-called culturally more advanced ethnic groups. Mr. Zhao Yuanren wrote an article on Chinese language teaching problems, analyzing the content of language teaching, and describing the past, present, and future of the vernacular movement and writing reform, which is especially worth reading by the Chinese people. World linguistics experts Ogden and Richards have also written special articles. The gathering of these experts is unmatched by general books.</p>
<p>Another value of this book is that the materials in this book are not commonly seen in general books on education. Usually, books on comparative education or texts introducing the educational situation of foreign countries are mostly about the education of several major countries such as Britain, the United States, the Soviet Union, and France. The many countries described in the first volume of this book are the opposite. Fundamental education should of course refer to the basic education of every ethnic group, but the object of fundamental education described in this book is ethnic groups with relatively backward cultural education. Mr. Chatton proposed the concept of the educational black belt in the second volume of this book. According to his view, educationally backward countries in the world can be divided into four zones, namely the Far East, the Middle East, Africa, and Latin America. The countries described in the first volume of this book, starting from the Americas, include Colombia, Ecuador, Guatemala, Haiti, Honduras, and Mexico. Then, the fundamental education of Africa is described, describing French West Africa and the Union of South Africa. Reminding everyone to pay attention to backward countries is unparalleled by other books.</p>
<h3>Prosaic Long Poem: Eugene Onegin</h3>
<p>— Translated by 頡頫</p>
<p>There are two types of typical literary figures: one is synthesized from existing characters of a certain class, such as Ah Q and Kong Yiji by Mr. Lu Xun. For this type of character, the author often predicts (or indicates) the path they should take in the future based on their existing shortcomings. For example, regarding Kong Yiji, Mr. Lu Xun bluntly said, "Without him, people would still live the same way," implying that old intellectuals would inevitably break out of the circle of helping others—to make it so that people cannot "live the same way" without him. The other type of typical character is created by the author through observing the development of social trends, such as Bazarov in Turgenev's "Fathers and Sons" and Eugene Onegin in Pushkin's "Eugene Onegin." When Pushkin's long poem "Eugene Onegin," consisting of over six thousand lines, was first published, there was no such character as Eugene Onegin in Russian aristocratic society. Therefore, critics heavily attacked him. However, soon there were countless Eugene Onegins in Imperial Russian society. Even in China, one hundred and twenty years later, there are many such characters.</p>
<p>In this poetic novel "Eugene Onegin," poetry and novel are most harmoniously combined, reaching the highest peak of narrative poetry. It is the first cornerstone of Soviet literature and art; it is a flourishing tree with deep roots in the Russian people. Gogol, Turgenev, Tolstoy, Gorky, and others have all rested under this tree, absorbing the fragrance of poetry.</p>
<p>Although "Eugene Onegin" is such a great work, its plot is not too complicated.</p>
<p>The protagonist, Eugene Onegin, is a vain and proud young nobleman. Due to his sense of superiority or hypocrisy, he indifferently views all his actions, whether good or bad, as the same. His uncle summons him to a village with a will, where he inherits vast estates and serfs. He is seen by his neighbors as a dangerous fellow because he reduces the corvée labor of the tenants and self-importantly avoids visits from his neighbors. He is only close to another young nobleman, the poet Lensky. One day, Lensky takes Onegin to his fiancée's house. His fiancée is a woman "who can be seen in any romance novel." She has a sister, Tatyana, a noble, pale, and idealistic young woman, whom Pushkin calls "my ideal, the soul of Russia." As soon as she sees Onegin, she immediately falls in love with him. She writes a letter to Onegin, saying that she will always belong to him. However, Onegin, who is usually romantic, rejects her with a lecture full of moralistic and superior airs because of his pride or because he sees through women's deceit. As a result, she becomes restless all day long and becomes even paler.</p>
<p>At this time, Lensky is deeply in love with his fiancée. Once, he invites Onegin to Tatyana's name-day party on behalf of his future in-laws. The noise of the party and Tatyana's distress because of him all arouse Onegin's dissatisfaction. Therefore, he suddenly feels resentment towards his friend's invitation; he feels he should take revenge. When the dance begins, he clings to the poet's fiancée until the end of the ball. At this time, the poet becomes furious; he feels he must decide his fate with a pistol—he wants to duel with Onegin. So, the next day, both sides draw their guns in the open field… and Onegin kills his friend.</p>
<p>Soon after the poet's death, his fiancée marries a military officer. And her sister, Tatyana, becomes even more haggard because of the loss of her sister's companionship and because Onegin travels abroad out of remorse for killing his friend. Therefore, her mother takes her to Moscow, to the "market of unmarried girls," to display her like merchandise. Sure enough, she is soon appreciated by a distinguished general and marries him.</p>
<p>Years later, she sees Onegin again at a ball. At this time, she is no longer a country girl but a graceful and luxurious young woman. Onegin begins to pursue her madly. He writes letters to her repeatedly, but all are met with stern rejection, just as Onegin had rejected her before. Therefore, Onegin begins to turn pale, and he shuts himself up in his house all winter. When the following spring comes, he visits her again. She is in tears, reading those letters he had given her before. It turns out that she still loves him! But to fulfill her husband's position, to be a virtuous wife and loving mother, she still sacrifices her love...</p>
<p>The story ends here; but what never ends is Tatyana's pale, frank, and bright heart and her great spirit of sacrifice. (Note: Translated by Lu Ying, hoping to publish.)</p>

<h3>Wang Lan Ying Seeks Her Father</h3>
<p>Mr. Wang Jinchen from Puyang, Hebei, Please Note</p>
<p>Editor: Four years ago, I rescued a small girl named Wang Lan Ying, who was completely covered in wounds and being abused, from a stationmaster with the surname Liu in Gaozhai, Puyang County, Hebei. Her father's name is Wang Jinchen (who was a merchant in Nanjing at the time). Lan Ying was living with her maternal grandmother. It was a year of famine, so her maternal grandmother decided to give her to the stationmaster surnamed Liu. Because the Liu's wife was unreasonable and he was afraid of his wife, he beat her several times a day. I couldn't stand this abuse, so I took her away. She is now fifteen years old and very smart. I plan to find her father so that they can be reunited. I hope your editor will sympathize and publish this, and hope that Wang Jinchen from Puyang will come to Huang Yousan, First Division, 5245 Unit, Suqian, after seeing the newspaper to recognize his daughter and fulfill my wish. With best wishes. Sincerely, Huang Yousan, June 1st.</p>
<p>Newspaper Awaiting Collection: On the afternoon of June 4th, a rickshaw puller named Wang Bocheng brought two reams of blank newsprint, claiming that a certain gentleman loaded two reams of newspapers at the Old West Gate and instructed him to deliver them to the intersection of Kangding Road and Jiaozhou Road. The gentleman accompanied him on a bicycle, but he lost contact with him halfway and could not find him. He went to the destination, but there was no sign of him. He could not deliver the paper, so he sent the paper for safekeeping and asked for a notice to be published to find the owner. Please publish this notice in your newspaper so that the owner can collect the paper at the office of this security within one week. Sincerely, Fan Weiping, 80th Security Section, Songshan District, Office of the Security Section at Anshunli Entrance, Jianguo East Road, June 5th.</p>

<h3>Erhu</h3>
<p>— Dunming</p>
<p>Someone downstairs is playing the erhu, squeaking and moaning. I don't know why, but I always feel that the sound of the erhu carries endless fatigue and anxiety, which is different from the shrillness of the jinghu. Liu Tianhua's erhu scores include "Sickbed Lament" and "Starving Horse Rattle Bell." I think he saw through the melancholic characteristics of the erhu's timbre.</p>
<p>The squeaking sound is intermittent. Only an old black and white cat in the courtyard is listening with half-open eyes. It only paid a little attention to the slowly falling poplar catkins, but when it saw that they were not edible, it lazily lay down again.</p>
<p>The first person to tell me about Liu Tianhua's name was Lao Shen. Not only was he a good erhu player, but he was also a volleyball player who had attended the North China Games. But he looked just like a peasant who had just come from the countryside. His hair was always so disheveled, and his gray robe was always so crumpled. When he spoke, he had a heavy accent from the suburbs of Nanjing—if he hadn't told me, no one would have believed that he was studying foreign literature at the most "Westernized" university in the country.</p>
<p>Classmates were busy attending social tea parties at the professors' houses, learning to speak English with ridiculous Oxford accents everywhere. Some held thick books in their rooms, and "matter-of-factly" held pipes in their mouths... But Lao Shen leisurely played the erhu. The quilt on his bed was scattered in a mess, and occasionally the corner of a complete works of Shakespeare would peek out from under the quilt. The professors asked questions in the classroom, and Lao Shen's answers were always slow, repetitive, and full of mistakes—the Shakespeare in the quilt seemed to be of no help to him other than putting him to sleep.</p>
<p>So, also at a time when poplar catkins were flying, we had our big exams. The big exams that year were particularly early because the situation in North China was tense, and the universities in Peiping hurriedly ended the semester.</p>
<p>That time, the most difficult subject was comparative linguistics, because there were countless "laws" that had to be memorized, and the examples proving these laws ranged from Sanskrit all the way to Northern European and French and Italian, and a few "strings" had to be memorized. Latin, of course, goes without saying. During these few days, almost everyone in our class was muttering to themselves, like madmen, just silently reciting what the first "Grimm's Law" was, what Jespersen's explanation was, and what Bloomfield's revision was. They even felt that the ceiling was full of various phonetic symbols when they were lying in bed.</p>
<p>Lao Shen was still playing the erhu, but he no longer played complete scores. Sometimes he would play two sentences and then stop. Someone looked at him from the window of the opposite room. It turned out that although he still held the erhu in his hand, his eyes were staring at his notebook.</p>
<p>On the day of the exam, the questions were unexpectedly easy. After the exam, everyone compared their answers in the campus, arguing very lively. Even Professor B, who was invigilating the exam, came over with a smile to discuss. She said that she had never seen American students so serious. After talking for a long time, she suddenly pointed at someone and said.</p>
<p>"Ah, I can't recognize you at all! Aren't you an athlete?"</p>
<p>We turned around and saw Lao Shen. His dark face was thin and haggard, and his eyes were red. He looked just like someone suffering from a serious illness!</p>
<p>He said he was not feeling well, could not sleep, and walked away listlessly.</p>
<p>As soon as I returned to the dormitory, I heard that squeaking sound again. I pushed open the door and walked into Lao Shen's room. He nodded to me blankly and pointed slightly to the table with the hand holding the erhu. He bared his teeth and smiled.</p>
<p>On the table was a copy of De Quincey's "Confessions of an English Opium-Eater."</p>
<p>He saw the puzzled look on my face and laughed loudly. He said, "There's no way! I can't keep up with you guys. I'm not even sure if I can pass!"</p>
<p>He had pulled three consecutive all-nighters, and his energy was not good, so he learned from De Quincey!</p>
<p>I couldn't help but be stunned by this volleyball star who was famous for "shutting down" Beiping. But he smiled again and started playing "Sickbed Lament"...</p>
<h3>Wireless Television</h3>
<p>— Lichu</p>
<p>In the near future, schoolchildren will be able to attend school in their own homes, presidential candidates will campaign in wireless television broadcasting studios, housewives can select clothes from wireless television and then make transactions over the phone, movie theaters will be deserted, and wireless radio will be as outdated as an autumn fan—so predict those in the United States who are familiar with wireless television.</p>
<p>Currently, there are only twenty-seven wireless television broadcasting stations in the United States (there are a total of one thousand six hundred wireless radio broadcasting stations), and only three hundred and twenty-five thousand wireless television sets (there are a total of more than sixty million wireless radios). Most of the wireless television sets are owned by residents of New York.</p>
<p>But this emerging industry is expanding. It is estimated that by the end of this year, the United States will have one million wireless television sets, sixty broadcasting stations, and the first coast-to-coast wireless television network in the United States will be completed in 1950. If the trend does not change, by 1954 the United States will have sixteen million wireless television sets and sixty-five million users.</p>
<p>Although the principle of wireless television was discovered as early as the end of the nineteenth century, the first real wireless television set was not officially launched until the New York World's Fair in 1939. (The wireless television set created by the British Broadcasting Corporation using many American materials was completed three years before.) Then the war broke out, and this "scientific toy" was put on hold for five years. When it was re-researched after the war, a technical problem arose, namely, whether to start improving color television or black-and-white television first. After several discussions, the U.S. Federal Communications Commission decided to start with black-and-white television first.</p>
<p>Like wireless radio when it first became popular, wireless television has had a huge impact on American life. Young women who used to spend all day with their boyfriends now stay at home—she invites her boyfriend home to watch television together. Naughty children no longer cause trouble outside. The best thing is that once a family has a wireless television set, it will be full of guests every day, so that the host cannot bear the burden of entertaining them and has to ask these guests to bring their own snacks.</p>
<p>This year happens to be the year of the presidential election in the United States, and candidates are also competing to meet voters in front of wireless television. The following are the results published by the American "Broadcasting" magazine: Truman, Vandenberg, and Wallace did the best; Dewey's small mustache, Stetson's youth, and MacArthur's baldness all had a slight impact on their results, but they were still able to "pass." The worst was Taft, whose "image" was not beautiful and whose speech was monotonous.</p>
<p>After wireless television became popular, the outlet for wireless radio was limited to the blind and busy housewives. In addition, it only had a place in cars. (There are currently nine million three hundred thousand car radios in the United States.)</p>
<h3>On Specialization</h3>
<p>— Shuofu</p>
<p>I read the following sentence in a collection of essays and literary criticism by the American writer Addington: "Often thinking of more than half a dozen things at the same time." I find it quite thought-provoking. If a person can complete six or seven things at the same time, he can definitely achieve six to seven times more than ordinary people. In terms of writing, if a writer writes a short essay while dictating a novel to a stenographer and conceives the plot of another play in his mind, then this person's output in writing is enough to match that of two or three writers.</p>
<p>At first, I admired this sentence very much. Extending it, if a person can live the lives of six or seven people in his life, wouldn't his experience be richer? Wouldn't life be more meaningful? Therefore, I also ventured to try a similar compact life. While I was compiling a textbook on economics beyond my capacity, I was also translating a long story for a magazine. In the meantime, I also took some time to write some small articles.</p>
<p>But in this way, my nerves were often very tense, and I often had toothaches and other phenomena. Gradually, I discovered that I was committing the fault of not being able to specialize. Fortunately, I discovered it early and restored the principle of doing only one thing at a time, and my mind immediately felt much lighter.</p>
<p>Indeed, working with concentration can give you a feeling of ease in spirit. For example, if you want to translate a novel, put the textbooks on economics principles, business management, etc. together in the bookcase. On your desk, just put an original book and tools such as English and French dictionaries. Writing at the desk naturally gives you a relaxed state of mind, and the speed of translation is also doubled. We can even say that specialization is the key to solving difficult problems.</p>
<h3>Officials Close to the People</h3>
<p>— Tongtuo</p>
<p>When Mayor La Guardia first arrived in New York, he went to the police station to visit the investigation court. At that time, it was the poor winter, and the police station brought in an unemployed person who had committed the crime of stealing bread. The only defense was that his family was starving.</p>
<p>"I should punish you," said La Guardia. "Because the law has no exceptions. I now pronounce: your theft should be fined ten dollars."</p>
<p>La Guardia then reached into his pocket and said, "The money here is to pay your fine for you. But—" La Guardia took off his wide-brimmed straw hat and threw ten banknotes into it. "... But everyone in this room, I want them to be fined fifty cents, because there is one person in their society who has to steal bread to have something to eat."</p>
<p>He took the hat and passed it from person to person in the court, and then poured this pile of clanging coins into the hands of the surprised and delighted defendant.</p>
<h3>Talking About "Wife"</h3>
<p>It is commonly said that one's own wife is called "laopo" (老婆), which sounds very unpleasant. According to Wen Yun: "Po (婆), extravagance, one says old mother is called," so po is the name of an old woman. Now, if the word "lao (老)" is added before "po (婆)", wouldn't it become "laolaoyong (老老媼)"? One must be at least eighty years old to deserve this title; but now even young people are called "laopo (老婆)", which is extremely jarring! However, this term already existed in Song Dynasty poems, such as Wang Jinqing's poem "The old woman is anxiously persuading me."</p>
<p>There is a humble way to call one's own wife "neiren (內人)," but this is also not very appropriate. According to the Tang Dynasty, the prostitutes of Jiaofang were selected into Yichunyuan, which was called "neiren (內人)," which meant that the neiren became the emperor's concubine! Tang Zhang You has the sentence "The neiren has already sung the spring oriole's trill" to prove it. Since "neiren (內人)" cannot be used, it is better to call "neizi (內子)," because "zi (子)" can also be used for women. Didn't Confucius meet with Weiling Gong's wife, Nanzi, which made Zilu very angry! (You Mo Jun)</p>
<p>In the Russo-Japanese War of 1904, the Qing government had already declared neutrality, and the Japanese forcibly entered Chinese territory and arrested Russian ships that had disarmed, causing General Sa Zhenbing to be punished by the Governor-General, which was also a regrettable incident. On July 8th of the 30th year of Guangxu, Beiyang Minister Yuan Shikai reported that according to Admiral Sa Zhenbing, who was in charge of the Beiyang Navy, at 4:15 on the first day of July, a Russian torpedo boat entered the neutral area of ​​Yantai. Admiral Sa immediately sent personnel to board the boat to inquire, dismantled the boat's artillery, torpedoes, and machinery, and signed a guarantee that it would not participate in the war and would not fly the Russian flag. After our navy supervised the completion, it was led to Xia'ao and guarded by another Hai Rong ship. At 7 o'clock, two Japanese torpedo boats entered the port. The Admiral personally went to the Japanese boat and told them that the Russian boat's weapons had been unloaded. The Japanese captain agreed to leave soon. Unexpectedly, at 3 o'clock in the morning on the second day, more than 30 Japanese soldiers boarded the Russian boat. The Hai Rong ship tried to stop them but they did not listen. They then towed the Russian boat away. The Admiral immediately raised the flag to order them to stop the wheel, but those who towed the Russian boat ignored them. One stopped the wheel, and the Admiral sent the Haiqi warship to the Deputy Captain to tell them that the Russian ship had been unloaded and should not be towed away. The Japanese captain replied that he would rush to inform the front ship and tow the Russian boat back, but he never returned. Admiral Sa Zhenbing had handled the Russian boat's entry into the port in accordance with public law, but because he lightly believed the Japanese, the Russian boat was towed away by the Japanese boat. Although he had tried to stop them in many ways, he was ultimately unable to protect them. In addition to telegraphing the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to investigate with the Japanese ambassador, he should ask the Emperor to order Sa Zhenbing to be handed over to the Ministry of War for discussion and punishment to show a warning. This incident can also be regarded as a scene of the Japanese showing their true colors. Their behavior is unreasonable, and their words are full of deceit. Even if they abuse their power, there is no straightforward and bright demeanor.</p>
<p>The July 7th Incident marked the official start of the War of Resistance. Before the July 7th Incident, the Japanese deliberately provoked trouble, appearing and disappearing unpredictably, insulting the people and obstructing government orders, causing trouble everywhere. After the "September 18th" Incident, the three northeastern provinces were occupied, and Tianjin and Hebei-Shandong provinces lost their defenses, exposing themselves to the wall. The Japanese were free to act, and many illegal vagrants were sent to the customs to entice and deceive with drugs and gambling, etc. The most commonly played trick was to create so-called "faits accomplis" at any time, that is, the evil customs of "plundering as property, forcing marriage," regardless of laws or treaties, or after invading or plundering, they considered it natural to have occupied and plundered. It was hateful and abrupt.</p>
<h3>Recent Poems by Xia'an</h3>
<p>— Ye Gongchuo</p>
<p>After I returned to my hometown, I closed my doors and never went out. During the Dragon Boat Festival in the old lunar calendar, the sound of drums from the dragon boat races on the Pearl River never stopped. People say that this year the villagers can expect a good harvest, so the dragon boats are particularly prosperous. Therefore, I composed a poem.</p>
<p>Twenty miles along the river, the midday drums are noisy, temporarily rejoicing at the abundant harvest and forgetting worries. I have long had no competition in my heart for empty boats, and I close myself in my empty studio, thinking of Qu Yuan.</p>
<p>Rejoicing that the Liu Mengjin Stele Returns South</p>
<p>Why bother to compare the rise and fall of the Six Dynasties, and rejoice that a piece of stone has returned to Hanling. Feiyuan's spirit is very clear, but I regret that Wang Xuecheng's return trip was interrupted. (It is said that Gan Hanshen Weng once dreamed of his daughter, saying that the stone would return to Guangdong, and the next day Yu Fan arrived, and he returned Yu Fan. It is estimated that it has been nearly forty years since Wang Xuecheng transported it to Shanghai in the Xinhai year.)</p>
<p>Nanda's inscriptions are hard to preserve, and my lifelong habit of collecting antiques has been given up. I am even more touched by the former dream of the Banyan Garden, and I want to ask Zhang Qian about the location. (When Hong Kong fell, I was managed by the Japanese and sold things for rice. The Zhao Hu tomb and Han Nanhai Jun Hu, which are about Cantonese documents, and the Jin Zhang Qian tomb farewell, all changed hands.)</p>
<p>Editor's Note: The above three recent poems by Mr. Ye Yuhu were recently sent from Guangdong to Shanghai. We are very happy to receive them from Mr. Lu Danlin. Mr. Lu also added a note saying that the Feiyuan mentioned in the poem is the name of Gan Hanshen's garden in Pudong, Shanghai, Wang Xuecheng is Wang Bing'en, and the Banyan Garden is Jian Yu Fan (also Wen), a room name in Xuhui, Shanghai. Gan Hanshen and Wang Xuecheng have both passed away, and the Banyan Garden has also changed hands recently.</p>
