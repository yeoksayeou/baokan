<p>〔合衆社華盛頓廿七日電〕蔣總統曾吿杜魯門總統稱。由於美國在雅爾達會議中之外交錯誤，美國現有目共然手中援教中國之義務，外交官員廿七日披露，蔣總統最近籲請杜魯門宣佈對華援助政策之函中，謂故總統羅斯福在雅爾逹之外交，應負事後東北陷於共黨之咎。按雅爾達協議除其他各點外曾規定中蘇共管東北兩鐵路，千島列島撥交蘇聯，幷促進蘇聯將簽署中蘇「友好與同盟」協定。外交界人士稱，蔣總統函內將國民政府之許多困難情形歸咎於雅爾達協議，而以中蘇協定爲尤甚，根據中蘇協定，蘇聯在東北受到中國許多讓步之處，彼等談稱：蔣總統申辯，中國僅因美國在雅爾產之外交束縛，違反中國自己之良好判斷而簽署中蘇協定。傳蔣總統曾吿杜魯門稱，因此美國有在此目前危機中協助國民政府之義務。蔣總統之續請與杜魯門之覆函均未經公佈。但美官員等非正式反對蔣總統申辯之理由，彼等認爲中國之失去東北，應由缺乏眞正對共黨作戰之意志，運用軍械之不當，及戰略不佳等情負責。</p>

<p>〔合衆社記者賈科柏徐州前綫廿八日電〕記者在徐州前綫所得之唯一印象卽爲保衛華中之國軍將士，士氣旺盛，彼等均願在任何時間勇猛作戰，與京滬一帶人仕前所預料者適得其反。當共軍進攻徐州之時，京滬之中立軍事觀察家，均搖頭長嘆，認爲共軍必將攻佔徐州。渠等常稱：目前最主要者卒爲國軍是否願意繼續作戰。渠等又繼稱：國軍在東北之慘敗及其他方面共軍之勝利，對保衛華中之國軍之十氣，可能係一種致命打擊。但就記者在過去兩日間在徐州南綫及東南綫所見之國軍，證明此項憂慮全無根據，國軍之士氣旺盛，並深信彼等決不失敗。特別在距徐州十二英哩之南部前綫，國軍制服整齊，裝配優良，運輸工具衆多（包括機動車及牲畜），同時國軍並深知彼等將向前推進。</p>
<p>當記者團經過時，羣以糖果等物投贈彼等，京滬慰勞團並以其他禮物相贈，當吾人停而與彼等問談時，彼等並以捲烟回敬，當少數肩運傷兵之架子經過時，彼等亦並不介意。</p>
<p>同時，記者在南部前綫所見之國軍將佐，均深具信心，幹練而能獲得部屬之愛戴，其中尤以下級之官佐爲多。</p>
<p>〔合衆社記老賈科柏徐州南部戰綫廿七日專電〕記者於廿七日赴徐州南綫某凸出之國軍戰壕會地視察，此時國軍業於前晚向前突進五公里，國軍此次於晚間作戰，一反慣例，因共軍素稱「夜問作戰是他們的」？</p>
<p>當吾人向數小時前尙係共軍佔據之地區進發時，孫元良將軍麾下之體格强壯及裝配優良之步兵，正在吾人迎面之山頭上，肅淸一晚間未能摧毀之共軍凸出陣地。此項軍隊並不斷由後方開出之精神飽滿愉快之士兵，加以增援。當渠等瞥見外籍記者團正向前綫進發時，許多人均翹起姆指，表示「頂好」之意。</p>
<p>孫元良將軍爲一九三七年在閘北英勇抗日之名將，渠深信渠將能克復宿縣，與北上國軍會師，粉碎共軍完全包圍徐州之企圖，在目前共軍轉而進攻蚱埠以圖威脅南京之際，渠將一舉而將之圍殲。記者繼詢以渠認爲是否能達成此項任務？孫將軍以生硬之英語答稱：「必然」！「必然」！</p>

<p>〔聯合社本市訊〕蔣夫人於今晚八時五十分自江灣機塲乘美國海軍四引擎運輸機飛美，預定將在關島停留片刻，但將在美國何處降落，則尙不得而知。美國陸海軍士兵在機塲戒備嚴密，不許記者團向夫人拍照或談話。</p>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓廿七日電〕一般推測蔣夫人來美訪問，主要在向美國人民直接呼籲援華，在目前美國國內之其他援華運動，正在推進中，其效果或將較蔣夫人為大。有組織之運動，係由基督徒之團體「基督復活社」及賓夕凡尼亞州亞倫鎭之WFMV電台發動，「基督復活社」之紐約總部曾向其社友發出通吿，要求渠等寫信或電吿杜魯門總績及國會議員，儘速加强援華，WFMV電台則向其他各電台發出信件二千五百封，要求渠等請聽衆向杜魯門及國會發表渠等對立卽全面採華之意見。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕昨日下午三時，孫院長在其官邸茶會，招待本市各重要社團負責人及大學校長，應邀出席者，有杜月笙，錢新之，潘公展，徐寄廣，王曉籟，劉鴻生，程滄波，江一平，馮有眞，徐永祚，周學湘，胡敦復，章益，胡文耀，歐元懷，趙棣華，傳沐波，周斐成，羅敦偉，成舍我，范爭波，徐可均，徐新余，任矜蘋，張匯文等二十餘人。對於當前國事，彼此開誠交換意見，至五時半始散。聞孫院長昨晚或今晨將入醫院療治足疾，故入京組閣，勢必俟諸數日以後。</p>
<p>孫院長在昨日茶會席上，首先說明此次奉命組閣，同辭不獲，祇能在與人民合作之基礎上，爲國盡力。蓋共匪叛國，政府戡亂，戰爭之性質，決非黨派之爭，亦非普通內戰，實爲抵抗共產國際第五縱隊之反侵略戰爭，國家民族生死存亡之所繫，全國人昆與政府應共負其責任。上海地位重要，市民之行動，尤足爲全國之表率，故余極願在就職之前，先向諸君聆敎。政府以往容有政策錯誤，或行政效率不高，今後必當虛心聽取人民的寳貴意見，改革行政機關辦事手續，力求提高效率，第一爭取軍事勝利，第二解除人民痛苦。深望諸君亦視政府爲人民自己之政府，竭誠貢獻其力量，必可收穫自救救國之效果。至於美援加强，在理應不成問題，祇須吾人首先努力自助，並以坦由眞誠之精神，與美國商談具體辦法，同時更能與美國軍事顧問　及經合分署等機構密切配合，採納其建議，善用其物資，並增進吾人之工作效能，自可使美國政府與人民對我刮目相看，而願加强其援助。假使美國有所希望於我國而為吾人所應方所能為者，吾人當迅速認眞實行。例如：（一）軍事顧問團之建議，可行者應卽辦，其眞不便行者亦宜說明理由，使彼諒解，吾人但求美援之加强，顧問團工作之更切實。（二）美援物資由外輪從美國口岸逕運我國沿海或長江各大口岸起卸，並於駛回時卽在該卸貨口岸裝運出口物資逕運美國，此種辦法旣省時間勞力，並可减少運費成本，且有特定期限，亦非在我國各口岸之間往來運貨載客，故並無開放內河航權之意義。政府今後各事，爲國家大計着限，應辦之事必卽辦，對人民合理之意見，必極尊重。政府對共匪，絶無妥協可言，自必作戰至最後勝利而後已。余深盼上海人民自動奮起，輸錢出力，自救救國。</p>

<h3 id="c20">抗議暹羅限制華僑入境 <a href="#c20" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e20" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">20</a></h3>
<p>正當邏羅大捕華僑，百般限制華僑敎育及工商活動之際，暹羅總理鑾披汶忽又宣佈實行「不歧視的移民配額制度」，規定自明年起，外國移民入境，一律爲二百名。這個新辦法公佈後，我國政府卽據理表示抗議，暹羅華僑對此項不合理之限制，亦咸表不滿。最近暹政府決定採取內政部移民入境特別委員會之建議，卽中國移民每年限額改爲五百人，藉以表示其「讓步」。事實上，這種限制華僑入境的辦法，是違反中暹友好條約，妨礙中暹歷中關係的一種不良措施。鑾披汶政府施行此項限制政策，乃鑾披汶的一種錯覺；我們民間輿論不僅要抗議此項不合理的措施，而且要糾正鑾披汶這一錯覺。</p>
<p>中暹歷史關係有一千六百年之久，中暹舊誼是和平而有禮，這在中暹史乘上均有顯著紀載，斑斑可考，晚近以來，中暹關係是隔離而不友誼，這都是鑾披汶一手造成，幾至無可補償。在大戰以前，鑾披汶以排華爲號召，致陷暹羅國運於悲慘的深淵。大戰以後，同盟國對鑾披汶的戰犯罪嫌未予淸算，讓他恢復自覺的理性，重做一個良善的人。去年「一一八」事變以後，鑾披汶重掌軍符，旋卽以「不流血革命」的方式，取乃寬橫拜亞政權而代之。鑾披汶執政後，故態復萌，尤其是排華政策，表演得最精彩。首先，暹政府封閉華僑學校，禁懸中國國旗，限制華僑子弟接受祖國敎育，並對華僑敎師予以種種限制。本年秋季開學後，華僑子弟有四千人返國求學。雖然全暹五百所僑校，現已准予開辦，但技術上很有問題，仍等於不辦。其次，對於華僑經營工商業之限制，暹羅民主黨草成一種限制華僑自由發展之計劃，其形式與菲律賓前此所訂者極爲近似。計劃規定華僑商店及貨棧，均須延暹人作副經理，其雇用暹人不得少於百分之五十，再次，對於華僑「不良份子」之逮捕，其數字亦至足驚人；六月十五日一天捕有六十三人，被放逐者有五十二人，八月十日約有三百人被捕，把全暹三百萬華僑陷於驚惶失措，進退失據之境。</p>
<p>與上述排華措施同時實施的，則爲限制華僑之入境。本年八月頒佈增加遞解華僑出境苛例一種，規定卅種職業者槪予取締，致若干華僑被迫出境。暹羅政府認限制華僑職業尙不够，近又頒行移民配額制度，限制華僑每年入境至多爲五百名，這無疑是一種不合理的片面規定。頃聞我國政府已向暹羅政府提出交涉，我們站在中暹友好關係的立塲，除抗議此種舉世所無的限制移民政策而外，並願從人類理性的觀點，糾正鑾披汶這一錯覺。</p>
<p>第一，暹羅的建國，同華僑的入境，關係密切而重大。昔日的暹羅，是一片荒蕪，華僑繁榮了暹羅工商業，並且開拓了廣沃的農田。暹羅的近代史，充滿了華僑的鮮血和熱淚，而華僑從不要求政治上的報償。暹羅人民有中華的血統，而華僑從小凌辱其後裔。總之，三百萬華僑是善良的，他們無爲而生活，祗求安居樂業，從無絲毫的優越感。他們需要一種生存上的安全，生活上的自由，這是有賴中暹友好條約爲之保障，及暹羅政治家的理性爲之保障。</p>
<p>第二，近代中暹邦交未建立前，華人入暹是自由的，晚近以來這種自由入境受着限制，但限制的尺度應該放寬，纔算合理的限制，不違乎理性的限制。根據戰前十年（卽一九二七至一九三六年）之統計，華人平均每年入暹超過出口數約萬八千名。大戰以後，我國駐暹大使李鐵錚與暹總理鑾貪隆商定，今後限制額應以一九二七至一九四一年十五年間之人口平均數爲依據，規定華人每年入暹爲萬四千名。這是中暹兩國共同的守則，並不因暹政權的更迭而失時效。所以鑾披汶政府限制爲五百名的規定，　　分不合理的。暹政府如自毀前項諾言，違反外交慣例，今後國與國間尙有何善隣關係可言？這一點，需要暹政府特別警覺和謹愼的。</p>
<p>我們指出上述兩點，希望暹政府接受我們善意的忠吿；同時喚起我國政府對暹外交的注意。過去的對暹外交，失之因循，致令僑胞受苦，說來傷心已極。我國人民對暹羅華僑的困境，滿懷悲憤，自更希望政府除抗議而外，速取行動，以糾正暹羅政府的錯覺。</p>

<p>美軍政府政治科長佛蘭克林稱：「選舉使蘇聯大感不快，蘇聯洞悉柏林公民之反蘇情緒，故決不政治自殺而允許自由投票」。大選目的在產生市參議員，原僅須選出不足三十席，然因蘇方之抵制，故擬選出九十八人。西方認爲每有一人投票，卽多反對蘇式極權之一人。若氣候良好，官方估計公民百分之八十五將參加投票，約一百五十萬人。如氣候不佳，則人數將大受影響。西界警察將出動戒備，特別在東西接讓地區，然僉料不致發生有系統之共產暴動。乞今市政府已有五　關自蘇界被迫遷出西柏林。西力官員認爲投票完竣之際，蘇聯將迫令每一機構撤出。數日前，蘇境德警已包圍市政廳，不准文件移出。三大反共政黨沉寂展開競選，與蘇聯則千計百方岡阻德人投票。</p>

<p>査該局官員活動所根據之帝國法令一零一號，要求彼等在有所行動前，必須由法務廳簽發拘票，新法令規定是項辦法並非必要。據該可靠方面人士稱：調査局官員久已感覺需要有立卽搜査拿捕或拘留之裁奪權。據稱：破壞活動之嫌疑份子趁簽發拘票時間銷毀證據或竟逃亡者，已屢見不鮮。又稱：所以將調査局任務擴及對左傾份子，一如對右傾分子同樣調查之原因，在予「共黨不良活動已見增多」。據指出過去三年來，佔領軍及日政府對右傾團體之鎭壓與撲滅工作嚴厲並精密，惟對左傾分子則甚少積極行動，致使較爲自由，任所欲爲，結果左右兩極端分子間之均勢完全破滅，左傾勢力地位日增。又新法令更將迫使大量各式社團會社向法務廳登記，目前已登記者，數約四千五百，乃以政治活動爲主之團體。此法令要求文化性經濟性，卽使政治色彩輕微之團體，亦欲一如完全政治性團體然，登記數將增爲萬餘。</p>

<p>〔法國新聞社巴黎廿七日電〕阿根廷外長勃拉馬格里亞今日仍繼續其私人談話，以作最後努力，覓取方法打開柏林之僵局·勃氏今日下午與蘇代表傑塞普會商，並望今夜或明晨往訪蘇代表維辛斯基，且圖會晤法代表巴洛迪及英代表買德幹。</p>
<p>〔合衆社巴黎廿八日電〕美助理國務卿索爾普廿八日在記者招待會中宣稱，美國仍願談判將西方發行之馬古自柏林撤退，然必須在蘇聯解除柏林封鎖後。同時某美國高級人士警吿稱，若柏林危機不能立卽解決，則恐在若千時日內，無解決之指望。安全理會主席阿根廷外長勃拉馬格里亞正努力作最後嘗試，，俾能草成折衷方案，於三十日渠主席任期滿前，由西方三國及蘇聯加以接受。然其努力似已註定失敗。西方以爲蘇聯不停止分裂柏林市之運動及各方開始統一柏林市政前，雙方獲致協議恐不可能。索爾普稱，外傳美國已退出規定以莫斯科八月卅日四强協定爲談判根據之決定，實屬不確。四强協定承認蘇聯發行之馬克爲柏林唯一通貨，而由蘇聯解除柏林封鎖。至於細則則交付四强軍事總督討論。其後總督會議竟不歡而散。索氏承認英美對爲幣制問題之解決辦法，容稍有歧見，然基本上絕無分裂。某西方高級人士稱，柏林局勢惡化極速，若不能立卽解決，則柏林勢將分裂爲二。渠又稱雖西方仍相信可獲協議，然如現狀不變，則蘇聯馬克永無成爲柏林唯一通貨之希望。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕本市私立中學敎職員聯誼會昨日下午召開各校代表大會，決議自今日起暫行總銷假，待生活有保障後，再正式銷假。會中並決議此次私校增收學費，市長准收一至三倍，各校如已超收者，請校長將超收之數發還學生。同時私立小學敎職員聯誼會亦於昨晨舉行理監事會議，決定接受市長勸吿，今日起暫行總銷假。惟對於實物配給事，決定推派代表向當局力爭，認爲敎師配給之享受，不應有公私之分。</p>

<h3 id="c71">姜參議員提質詢請市長答覆八點 <a href="#c71" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e71" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">71</a></h3>
<p>市參議員姜懷素昨發表稱；閱本月二十六日報載吳市長駁覆私立學校四點要求，可謂合法合理，但是隔了一天，在二十七日的報載吳市長召開私校校長會議，就表示可增加一倍至三倍，因爲這都是新聞的報道，是否眞是如此，未敢確定，祗有再請市長對於後列的質詢，詳加解釋：</p>
<p>（一）本屆秋季始業時，學費的計算，是按照當時物價，一次計算，足敷半年之用，而貧苦的家長，要求分兩期付給，學校方面，是絕對不肯的，因此失學的不知凡幾？現在學校說不够開支，敎員說不能生活，這種責任，是否應由家長負擔？</p>
<p>（二）本學期學費，家長繳的金圓券，其價値爲黃金一兩，換來金圓券二百元，限價自八一九起至十月三十一日止，也有七十四夭的長期，校長和敎員，何以對半年的開支與生活，會毫無計劃地運用？如果說是因爲金圓劵貶値了，請問金圓券的貶値，是誰的責任，卽應向誰去請求賠償。</p>
<p>（三）學校收費，在歷史上是每學期一次，因此校長得以拒絕家長的分期繳付的請求，此番准許追加第二次，則此例一開，將來是否可追加三次四次，或每月一次二次，因爲物價是常常變動的。</p>
<p>（四）今年的學費可以追加第二次，請問明年學費是否照例辦理？將來家長是否可分期繳付？</p>
<p>（五）追加學費，是根據何種敎育法令？政府是否有權核准這種强以家長作無義務無責任的負祖？</p>
<p>（六）家長因經濟困難繳不起，或者因顧到法令上規定契約行爲，必須雙方同守的尊嚴而不願繳，政府是否也准許學校開除學生的學籍。</p>
<p>（七）學校有校董會的組織，現在校董會旣不負担學校的經濟，要此處名何用？改由全體家長大會來代替可也，請解釋校董會的責任和今後對校董會的處置。</p>
<p>（八）學校可以違背契約行爲，追加學費，則商店對於定貨之虧本，是否也可向顧主迫加貨價？政府對於人民應該不偏不倚，農工商學應該一律平等待遇。懷素對於學校追收第二次的學費，不表同情，但對於敎職員的淸苦，却是很同情的，因此建議最好是用「淸寒敎職員冬令救濟金」的名義，如果敎職員不肯承受救濟，那不妨仍走「尊師金」一條老路，應由敎育局會同市參議會敎育團體和敎職員聯誼會來發動擴大的勸募，因爲硬性規定由家長負擔，則家長負擔不起，又向誰處求負担呢？鄙見如此，敬請市長解釋？</p>

<h3 id="c99">請助學金不得寃哉淸寒學生　知校增收費用聲中一件令人憤懣的事 <a href="#c99" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e99" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">99</a></h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕本市各私立中小學增收學費，在敎職員力爭之下，業經市府核准增收一倍至三倍。在「合法」增費之下，敎職員之收入由此固可稍獲增補，但一般家長之負祖則因此自將加重。雖然事無兩全，爲教職員生活而多出學費尙有可說，但使不少家畏及社會熟心人士憤懣不平不甘沉默者，則爲若干學校之學店作風，所謂取之於學生者不厭其多，賜之於俗學生者則極盡其吝。</p>
<p>日前本報社會服務攔爲助學金事再答讀者，據稱向太報申請助學金而經初審通過者原有三百二十九人，後經獎學金統一審核委員會複核，僅通過一百三十七人，其餘一百九十二人因其肄業學校始終朱將免費生名册造報，或雖已造送名册，而免費名額不足。按獎學金統一審核委員會之定軍，凡向任何機關團體申請助學金之學生，必須該生所肄業之學校，已有足額之免費學生，而無法再行申請者，方能予以核准，旨在杜防學校「慷他人之慨」。若干學校（校名曾予披露）旣未造送名册，或雖已造送而名額不足，目不能予以核准。</p>
<p>依照規定，每一中學校應有百分之二十免費生名額，然則前述各校中不乏歷史悠久聲譽卓著者，何以未能依照規定？據記者訪問數校負實人，被等或稱該校學生大都家境尙可，申請免費者爲數不多，成稱申請者雖多，而合乎淸寒優秀條件者甚少，因而不足免費名額·記者繼詢以然則何以該校學生尙有向太報申請助學金者，何以尙有輕本報審査後認爲合格者？彼等囁嚅其詞，答稱對於此項學生可再予調查云云。據熟悉內幕者談：若千學校對於百分之二十之規定，根本視若具文，於學生之申請極盡留難挑剔，其眞正原因無非爲不願减少收益而已。</p>
<p>在敎育局方面，對於此種學校所能爲者，僅是公文督促，而據聞不少學校對於敎育局之命令，常置之不理。此次因學校免費名額不足而受影響未能領到太報助學金之學生，獎學金統審會將移請敎育局轉飭各十該校予以免費，但各校是否能予邀行，實屬疑問，况一轉一飭之間，又不知須費幾許時日。卽如本報助學金而言，中學每人金額爲十元至三十元，在本學期開始時可値白米一石左右，但因須送經統一審核委員會複核，統審會又須等待各校造送免費名額，致遷延迄至最近始能發給，然一二十元之數，於今僅足供遠道領取之車資。全失助學宗旨突，故主其事者均深爲痛心。</p>

<p>昨日上半時相當精彩，龍頭諸東北風健將，表演有聲有色，靑白大軍竟爲所窘，無法進展，不料下半時起，形勢大變，球在龍頭陣地，盤旋不去，靑中果中二球，以二比一佔先，繼而在最後二十分鐘，又連中三元，以五比一結束。靑白前鋒頗有佳妙表演，龍頭下半時屢攻不入，球路盡塞，益以後衛大意，卒致無法挽救，其中競爭情形之劇烈，並不能以五對一之比數代表。</p>

<p>休息再戰，兩陣重圓，雙方原班人馬。靑白反發，攻勢大盛，未五分鐘，阿福於亂軍中傳金祿，各一成和局。球勢仍在靑白手中，十分鐘時，小羅前進，在近門處傳交阿福，閭承實見勢危急衝出，阿福一鏟進網。靑白二比一後來居上。龍頭反攻，處處被阻，士氣漸衰，然形勢仍極平均，頗有平反可能。不料三十分鐘時，費春華傳球阿福，鄭秉彝出阻，　一盤而過，近球斜攻，果然近網，近三比一。靑白捲土重來，薛沛然傳小羅，刀劈三關，掃入網內，四比一龍頭大勢已去，終塲前小羅再來一個低射，閻承寬欲救不得，五比一結束。</p>

<h3 id="c109">徐州會戰第一回合　（上） <a href="#c109" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e109" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">109</a></h3>
<p>— 本報特派記者　凌松壽</p>
<p>〔太報蚌埠廿五日快訊〕徐州會戰的初期勝利，將正吿世界：勝利是永遠屬於正義的·會戰未爆發前，國軍卽自動放葉鄭·汴·商邱及東海·連雲港等地，集中兵力於徐州外圍。當時計在徐州正面的是李　兵團，徐西是邱淸泉兵團，徐東是黃百韜兵團，這三大兵團，在過去兩年的戡亂過程中，轉戰於魯·蘇·皖·豫等地，都是每戰必勝的鐵軍，加以徐州之戰，不僅是保衛徐州，也不僅是保衛首都，而是保衛我中華民族的獨立：民主和自由之戰，關係重大，所以國軍在這次戰事中是「哀兵」，每一位將士都了解今天在他們雙肩上是祖負着如何神聖而重大的使命。也都願意爲國家民族去對共匪作殊死的奮鬥，正如徐州剿匪總司令劉經扶將軍所說的：「有必勝的信念，有必死的決心。」因此，在本質上，國軍已具備了勝利的基礎。</p>
<p>共匪怎樣進犯</p>
<p>共匪的部署是以劉伯承部第一·三·九·十一等四個縱隊，陳賡部第四·九等兩個縱隊，陳毅部第三·八，兩廣等三個縱隊，對徐州西側的邱淸泉兵團，作牽制性的攻擊，以陳毅部第一·四·六·七·新八·十等六個縱隊，攻擊徐州正面，以牽制李彌兵團，另以陳毅部之第二·新七·新九·九·十一·十二·十三等七個縱隊，在徐州東側對黃百韜兵團展開主力攻擊。</p>
<p>戰事正式起於十一月八日，當日晨間，共匪以第七·新八兩縱隊進攻韓莊，國軍以戰略關係，於殲滅了來犯共匪的一部主力之後，隨卽撤守。當晚，徐州東西兩側共匪，又開始對國軍的兩翼進犯。</p>
<p>東西丙翼捷音</p>
<p>西翼方面，共匪用的是陳賡部第四。九，兩縱隊，和陳毅部第三，八。兩廣三個縱隊的一部，碰到了在豫東稱雄的「火牛軍」邱清泉兵團，焉有放鬆？黃口一戰，匪傷亡一萬以上，國軍首傳捷報。</p>
<p>東翼方面，黃兵團以運河爲屏障，對正面來犯的陳匪第二·新七·十一·十二·十三等縱隊，迎頭痛擊，在運河站和窑灣兩地，予匪以重創。</p>
<p>黃兵團打硬仗</p>
<p>黃兵團原來的陣地，是自徐州以東的大許家起直到運河站的這沿隴海鐵路兩側地區。九日起，原在韓莊，台兒莊一綫的匪第一·四·六·七·新八·十等縱隊，奪路南下，首先截斷黃兵團與徐州間的聯緊，這時在東綫的匪第二·十一·十二·三個縱隊，復迂迥至黃丘團主要陣地的碾莊南面，合圍的態勢於十日形成，黃兵團於是縮短陣地，以碾莊爲核心，對周圍超過本身兵力數倍以上的共匪，展開了火併的塲面。</p>
<p>黃百韜將軍年來轉戰於魯南。蘇北·豫東等戰塲打仗回以穩硬著稱，對於當前這個聚殲匪軍主力的最好機會，自然不肯錯過，於是十二日捷報再傳，黃兵團配合空軍，在東綫擊潰了匪九個縱隊十六萬人以上的攻勢，匪軍傷亡達三萬七千餘人。</p>
<p>邱兵團反包圍</p>
<p>共匪之意在「吃去」黃兵團之企圖，旣已昭然若揭，於是當局復以原在酉翼的邱淸泉兵團，揮師東進，對東綫之匪，佈置反包團態勢，這當兒在西綫受創的劉，陳等部之殘部，還企細策擊東綫，阻止邱兵團之東進，乃於十三日分三路由蕭縣。永城地區間迂週南竄，窺伺徐州南側及宿縣。徐州方面，旱料共匪有此一着，隨調在渦蒙地區掃蕩的孫元良兵團北上，防衛徐州，宿縣縣城雖於十五日夜間在駐軍交警，總隊苦守不支下而吿陷落，但對於當時的徐州戰局則毫無影響。</p>
<p>劉匪的南下，阻碍不了邱兵團的行動，邱兵團於十三日沿隴海路的南側前進，我裝甲車羣，也在蔣緯國上校的指揮下，配合邱兵團對南面頑抗的陳匪第一·四·七·十等縱隊予以打擊，十六日午前十時，邱兵團配合空軍戰車於沿途殲滅共匪兩萬餘人以後，與被圍已達六日夜之久的黃兵團會師，黃兵團在邱兵團東進期聞，又繼續消滅匪的主力萬餘。徐州剿總的捷報，當天就傳布全國各地，關心戰局的人，都爲這個勝利而微笑。</p>
<p>三大兵團會合</p>
<p>邱黃會師，兩大兵團再配合上李彌部分頭追剿，共匪似乎還感覺到這次慘敗的不够，十七日起，電新糾集殘部，向東綫猛撲，並以陳毅的第二。四。十二等縱隊，協同原在徐州南面的劉伯承部，試襲徐州東南側。在這個時間以前數天中，我徐州南面的孫元良兵團已經對前來送死的劉陳諸部，殲滅了五千人以上。</p>
<p>共軍旣不肯認輸，而捲土重來作困獸之鬥，在國軍是求之不得的事。於是邱兵團回師兜剿，自十七日晚間起，至十八日拂曉，一夜中我國軍槍砲的火花，神鷹的怒吼，在徐州東南二十餘華里的潘塘鎭主力戰塲中，兩萬多的共匪又被我百戰百勝的「火牛軍」殲滅了。還有八千多已經覺悟了的受共匪驅使作戰的善良同胞，紛紛向國軍投誠，這就是「徐南之捷」。邱兵團會合孫兵團乘勝南剿，於十九日抵達三堡以南，續收豐碩的戰果。</p>
<p>再度苦守碾莊</p>
<p>邱兵團回師之日，就是東綫黃兵團爲繼續吸引匪的主力再度孤守碾莊而苦戰之時，由徐州東進的李彌兵團，沿途受共匪的頑抗·斬獲雖豐，但前進的速度不免打了折扣。直到廿二日爲止，李兵團距碾莊尙有三十餘華里，而在廿一日，堅守碾莊已達十二晝夜的黃兵團，因受共匪密集火網的射擊，單就砲彈而論，碾莊陣地卽落有萬餘發之多。據點工事，已經悉遭摧殘，不堪利用，黃兵團復轉移到碾莊東北某處陣塊中，繼續苦戰。</p>
<p>所獲超過所失</p>
<p>徐州會戰，不同於過去各次的大戰。這次會戰，是匪我雙方，各就其黃河以南之主力作一決定性之戰事。因此，在這個會戰中，一村一鎭之得失，對大局實不足重輕，以黃兵團而論，在數倍於我方以上之兵力圍困下，苦守孤點達十餘晝夜之久，並且當而斃匪在十萬人以上，這是剿匪過程中所僅見的輝煌戰績。有黃兵團在東綫一日，他便吸引着共匪大部主力，使得徐州附近戰塲上，李·邱·孫各兵團得從容地解決匪之主力，有黃兵團在東綫一日，共匪便無法逃竄於主力戰塲以外，而坐待我各路大軍，布署圍兜，一鼓而殲滅之。所以，十三日夜來，縱使黃豐幽有相當損失，但是這個損失，一方面比較目前國軍所收到的戰果固然已經微乎其微，而主要的便是，這些微損失，將使國軍奠定了在徐州會戰的次一階段中獲取更大勝利的基礎。</p>
<p>共匪死傷廿萬</p>
<p>彝整個戰局的發展過程說，我們可以把「徐南大捷」作爲徐州會戰初期戰事的結束，在這個階段中，毫無疑義地，勝利是屬於國軍。在十四日共匪的廣播中，自己已經承認死傷六萬餘，十六日的廣播，自己則承認死傷十萬，加上以後徐東。徐南兩次戰役中的共匪死傷，和他自己廣播時可能打了個折扣的差額，我們估計共匪死傷二十萬人，當非誇張之數。縱使黃河以南的共匪實力再多些，總決不會超過六十萬人，現在却已去了三分之一。就會戰初期的結果判斷，我們敢於斷言今後共匪在華中當不能更有所作爲了，何况在會戰的第二個階段中，其環境爲更有利於國軍。</p>

<p>據該業人士觀察，其主要原因有二：（一）由於大戶之觀望，及大量傾出。（二）上次烟價劇漲後，一般購買力已大减，本市之銷量有限，而各烟廠又復陸續派貨，致市面存底益見充沛。加以市上銀根仍緊，現鈔頭寸缺乏，暗息奇高等種種因素，致烟市萎靡不振，如無特殊情形，短期內難望轉機云。</p>

<h3 id="c122">釋「官」 <a href="#c122" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e122" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">122</a></h3>
<p>— 雷霆</p>
<p>官，在我國，是一向高高在上的。而四民當中和官最接近的則爲士。「學而優則仕」，便是最明顯的註脚。周禮：「設官分職」，則官的設置，該是各守其職，爲國治事。又：「論定然後官之」。所謂「論」，當然是朝廷的評定和一般的與論；這一方面說明任官的不可不愼，另一方面也說明了做官的也該有其聲譽和抱負，民國以後，官的名稱雖一變而爲公僕，沒有專制時代「大人」「老爺」的尊嚴，平民化了。但因他管的還是衆人的事，有權，名雖變而實仍存，還是高高地高居在上。</p>
<p>據此，則所謂官，無論在專制時代或民主時代，都是尊嚴的，至少在中國，在現在的中國，還是如此。所謂公僕，只不過便於和民主作了一個對照。如果有人自居主人，而以「僕」視官，則未免失之千里了。</p>
<p>因此我對於官的第一個看法是：</p>
<p>這是第一解。</p>
<p>但「學而優則仕」的原則，則仍沒有變，所不同的是專制時代，進士舉人是作官的敲門磚，現在則換了博士或碩士。從前是以天子門生爲榮，現在則以鍍金博士爲尙；名雖異而實有點相同（像美國裁縫而榮任總統，我國尙無前例）。至於最近新添的社會賢達，則又略等於從前的徵君，那只是千載一時的機會。所以最重要的還是學。但所謂學，並不一定是經論之「學」，治世之才，不能呆看。</p>
<p>所以我對於官的第二個看法，是；</p>
<p>學銜加聲譽。如能再上豐度，更佳。</p>
<p>這是第二解。</p>
<p>以上所舉，是官的本質，說得粗俗一點，該是官的本錢。本錢越大，則地位爬得越高，這又是萬古不磨的眞理。</p>
<p>但單靠本錢，仍然不够。因爲這還不過是一塊敲門磚，門敲開了，磚已無用。例如從前由士而仕的人，官是做到了，但弄到身敗名裂的也有，兩袖淸風的也有，永遠爬不上的也有。所以致此的原因，是沒有手腕。因此做，官的最重要的法實該是手腕。</p>
<p>說到手腕，眞是千變萬化，玄妙無窮。但扼要地說，也不過八個字：「因時制宜，隨機應變」而已。例如該嚴肅的時候要嚴肅，該和緩的時候又要和緩；上一句是根據法律，下一句又不妨是揆諸人情。「深表同情」，是惠而不費的慷慨，多多益善；「應毋庸議」，是義正詞嚴的成語，用用何妨—辦法越多越好，不妨以言代行，因爲中國人本是最健忘的民族；今天說的話，明天要有否認的勇氣，上午發的令，下午要有推翻的本領。總之，對象是綿羊，自己儼然是老虎；對象是老虎，自己又不妨暫屈身作綿羊。以不變應萬變，是我們的政治方針，以億萬變臉億萬變，則是我們今日的公僕的爲官方法。因此，我對於官的第三個看法是：</p>
<p>千變萬化，該有齊天大豐的本領。</p>
<p>這是第三解。</p>
<p>寫到這里，忽然想起了第一段的「爲國治事」和「論定然後官之」兩句話，該怎樣解釋呢？</p>
<p>這一想倒使我發呆了。然而姑不妨這樣說：「論」是上司的判斷，「定」是上司的決定吧。旣由上司的判斷和決定，被判斷和決定者便穿上公僕的公服，走馬上任了。</p>
<p>然則「爲國治事」呢？這眞無法答覆。幸而靈機一動，計上心來，便老着臉答道：「本來我已經忘記了，便索性忘記到底吧，好在我們多數的公僕大人，大多數似乎也早忘記了。」</p>

<p>— 吳庸</p>
<p>欲求國之治，養成社會良好之風氣最爲緊要。「上有好之者，下必有甚焉」，這是說風氣須自上至下去養成。此是一說。在民主國家，却是民有好之者，上必有不得不然焉，乃是自下而上的。自下而上，其本身也是一種好風氣。</p>
<p>人到需要他人帮助時才倡互助之論。</p>
<p>叫人不要揩油乃是恐油被人揩去者設的。</p>
<p>「服從」是上司對下屬之辭，蓋也是單方面的</p>
<p>無論是人是事，好得過份便會變成不好；反之，只要適可而止，壞的也不會成爲眞壞。只要抱中庸之道，卽「無所不爲」亦無不可</p>
<p>世間有可惡的僞君子，有可愛的眞小人。</p>

<p>— 尢墨君</p>
<p>屈指算去，自吸粉筆灰過生活以來，足足已在四十年以外了。半生不喜別的，只喜書籍。寗可著得破些，吃得差些，惟有書籍則不可不買。因此之故，寒舍一問陋室裏，桌上，架上，甚至洋油箱中，破皮箱中，都裝滿了書。某書在何處，某書壓在某書之下，只有我一人曉得，家人從不敢妄動；故這間陋室，雖未高掛「聞人莫入」的虎頭牌，然而彷彿已成爲我的禁地了。</p>
<p>近幾年來，不知如何，每感到窮敎員嘸啥做頭，故立誓不再買書。以前喜歡跑跑新舊書肆，挖腰包換得一二本書，挾着歸家，當做珍寳似的收藏起來。現則索性連日報上所刊各大書肆的新書廣吿也不敢正眼對它瞧一下，爲的是每摸腰包，「空空如也，吾叩其兩端而竭焉」！校中圖書室內，固不乏我所愛讀的書，然而這些書，只好把它們當做貴賓看待，不敢屈留多日。</p>
<p>老妻曾屢勸我，後輩旣非讀書子，要這此書何用？不如親自整理一下：可留者則留之，不可留者則賣之，甚至或論斤秤去之。她的話未嘗不對。然奔走衣食不暇，那有餘暇整理？卽有工夫，試問像一部詩韻，還是十三四歲時學做五言八韻試帖時買來的，現在固無需它來指導，然故舊情深，又怎忍把它割愛，論斤賣去，使它做還魂紙，或甚至在大餅攤上出現呢！</p>
<p>最近舍弟植仁亦動賣書之想。其理由是留之何用，及今賣去，還可派派別的用途。因勸我旣非研究本國歷史，一部開明版二十五史倒著實可以換些魚肉吃吃。其話對極。不過這次返里，見到那部二十五史還是緊守崗位，太著它一貫的不動姿勢，站在那破書樹中，盡其守衛之責，我也只好對它瞟着一眼，太息而出了！</p>
<p>寒舍本藏有多年本報，且已裝訂成册。大約家人因見我沒出息，故趁我在滬時，竟硬手硬脚地秤斤賣去，以易斗米。我因自忖：除非他們肯下毒手，我是決不願再作買書之想的。</p>

<p>最近，美國的約翰士。霍布金斯大學忽然宣布大量買螢。不論死活，每一百只的代價是美金二角五分，一時忙壞了全市的小孩子。據該大學方而稱，螢的尾部的光中可能含有一種維他命K。</p>

<p>— 細侯</p>
<p>昔人誇耀家門裏的出色人物，常帶着一種讚嘆的口氣，如：「此吾家千里駒也！」「吾家黃鬚兒！」顯得很親切動人。後來的人家，不知是榨不出貨色來呢，還是特別尊重祖先，總要追溯上十代幾十代的祖宗，挑選個把合式的人物，如姓陶的說起「吾家淵明」，姓李的提到「吾家太白」，言下猶沾沾自喜，彷彿他就具有淵明太白輩的遺風似的。</p>
<p>這範圍有時更擴充到「吾家太眞」「吾家小小」，就更覺風流倜儻了。至於女性自身却很少把「吾家道媼」「吾家易安」掛在嘴邊的。這自然由於男性中心社會，女性自己都跟夫家姓，開不出口。這份巧宗兒只好讓男人佔了。</p>
<p>直到目前「吾家什麼」的聲浪仍不絕於耳，言者或許無心，聽者覺得肉麻。尙不止此。卽是一湖一山，如與前人姓氏有關，也會有後代出面認帳。不多幾時還見一位「窮寨主」的後人（？），提起蘇州天平山，却道是「吾家天平」。蓋天平又名「范墳山」也。時世日進，將來終有一天，還怕沒有人誇口道：「請看今日之域中，盡是吾家之天下」！</p>

<p>有許多剛愎自用的人，年齡愈大，成見愈深，以致在遺囑裏還要緊緊管住他們的子弟，必須要那些繼承人先履行若千條件，然後才讓他們拿到遺產。他們的條件有時簡直荒唐無聊，近乎開玩笑，然而，至少美國，這些條件是具有法律價値的。</p>
<p>有一個老處女生平最痛恨的是少女們打扮得花枝招展。因之在遺囑中就說，她願將所有產業傳給她的姪孫女，但是有一個條件：在她死後六個月內，那位姪孫女不准塗脂抹粉。那位少女遵從了遺命，順利地承襲了遺產。</p>

<p>有一人遺囑中規定他所經營的一家規模宏的保險公司由他的胞弟繼承，但也有一假怪條件——店中所雇用的女職員，體重必須都在一百四十磅以上。他的弟弟欣然從命。</p>
<p>最怪的是一個人在臨終時答應把所有的錢財都給他的妻子，却有一個條件：她必須在他死後五年內改嫁。他的遺囑中解釋着說，他是想叫別人知道和她相處是如何難受。</p>

<p>現在金鈔是許可持有了。在解禁以前，北方對於檢査私藏，獎勵吿密，亦曾雷厲風行了幾次。檢査是官方主動的，只要多派員警向金店銀樓之類「突擎」好了。至於民戶之藏，在櫛比鱗次的都市，實屬無從査考，只可仰仗私人吿密。其獎勵告密之條，曰：査出私藏，可分給若干與吿密的人。其限制吿密之條，曰：必須具眞實姓名住址，以防挾仇誣吿。以爲這就是周妥的辦法，其是否周妥，今且勿論，而天津地方出了一個吿密的喜劇（亦是悲劇），郤値得一談。</p>
<p>遲之又久，纔發生了吿發藏金一案，的確査出黃物二十三兩，的確有吿密人眞實姓名住址，毫不含糊，原來是一婦人，而被吿的就是她的丈夫。而吿發的原因，則是丈夫有了外室，並且把金子津貼情人，以此激動她的憤火，決計大家拼一拼！動機旣是如此，當然不用匿名，而且家庭糾紛，原原本本，坦白上陳，彷彿演了一齣「二美奪夫」（一名雙搖會），又似乎「女起解」劇中崇公道說蘇三與皮氏的話：「醋海生波」！這誠然是一齣「悲劇的喜劇」，然以雷厲風行的「經改』大事，而竟落到如此的戯劇風光！吾人又不暇爲此一家的家醜而悲喜了。</p>
<p>須知「吿密」之舉，於人心風俗，社會秩序，關係甚大。從前政府對此極端愼重，更防流弊，決不輕用，恐共徒便私圖，且妨政體。至於人民方面，事不干己，計肯多事，卽云得獎，亦是「拈來羊肉，惹一身騷」，衆人之指摘，後患之糾心，得不償失，此理易明。所以如果眞有吿密的事，必是私憤，而且不是尋常的憤，必是「憤火中燒，拼他一拼」的憤！如此，當然不怕具名出面。所難堪者郤在官府一面，若不處分，則自己的功令，無法交代。若竟處分，又顯然代人消妒，不像公事。</p>
<p>在昔帝制時代，惟於大逆罪，許人吿密。淸初好多起的文字獄由此發生，那是帝王的私心，加以種族之見，惟恐有人懷想前明，謀爲不軌。至於普通政事，有司衙門於窩盜，走私等案，雖可吿發，但無所謂「吿密」。（於秘密結會，企圖作亂者，則有「吿密」一詞，還是逆案性質。）民間惟私憤或希榮賣友之敗類不惜出頭，卽使領得獎勵，社會鄉里間亦必認爲「怖物」，爲衆所厭棄。總之，「吿密」一詞，決非政治軌道上之常例，（一）虧政體，（二）傷風俗；（三）失人心。</p>
<p>所以，天津此案，若只就一家一事，誠不値一笑。若作爲政府獎勵吿密一種自然的　刺，則很有意思了。</p>

<p>[Special Dispatch from Bengbu, 28th] The Bengbu-Suxian Campaign, also the next stage of the Xuzhou Campaign, has officially begun with the battle at Guzhen. Last night, the bandits attempted to attack the National Army's Hugou position with a portion of their forces, resulting in fierce fighting throughout the night. By this morning, one bandit division had been defeated. The National Army initially reported victory. Fierce fighting has been ongoing in Guzhen since 4:00 AM this morning. According to observations from the air over Guzhen this afternoon, both sides are engaging in intense artillery fire in the area north of Guzhen.

It has been determined that the attacking bandit troops include the Second Column of the Liu bandits.</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Bengbu, 28th] Frequent contact among senior generals indicates that the Bengbu-Suxian Campaign has already broken out. Starting tomorrow, the National Army's three major corps, led by Li Yannian, Liu Ruming, and Huang Wei, will have established a highly advantageous defensive line along the south bank of the Huai River, stretching from Dongping, Hugou, Guzhen, to Tuohezhen, waiting for the communist bandits to come and be annihilated, aiming to create an even greater victory following the Xuzhou triumph.</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Bengbu, 28th] The battle on this front has already begun. Bengbu's public morale is extremely stable. The streets are bustling with activity, just as they are on normal days. Military transport is frequent on the Jinpu Railway north of Bengbu, and the Air Force is also constantly flying back and forth over Bengbu. Furthermore, a certain unit of heavy weapons troops from the north has now appeared on the streets, but residents pay it no mind. All trains between Pukou and Bengbu are operating as usual.</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Bengbu, 28th] Xu Shiyou, the bandit deputy commander stationed in Lingbi, leading four columns including the 11th and 13th, has suddenly fled west again, attempting to prevent the National Army from heading north to assist. The Li Yannian Corps on the Jinpu Railway front intercepted them at Xisipo and Renqiao. The Huang Wei Corps moved south from Nanpingji, preparing to turn and inflict a severe blow. Skirmishes have been occurring daily on the south bank of the Huai River. The Air Force has been frequently bombing the area.</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Bengbu, 28th] Military News: The communist bandits on the periphery of Xuzhou have almost entirely moved south. Their location has not yet been determined. The four columns of Chen bandits under the command of bandit leader Xu Shiyou have begun to flee west from the Lingbi-Suxian area towards the front-line positions of the National Army's Huang Corps.</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Xuzhou, 28th] A major battle in the Suxian area has begun fiercely. Today, seven bandit columns and the Huang and Li Corps engaged in an interlocking siege and annihilation battle along the line from Xishipu west of Suxian and south of Nanpingji. The National Army's firepower is intense, holding an advantageous position. The Air Force and artillery groups are assisting in the battle, resulting in numerous enemy casualties.</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Xuzhou, 28th] The Qiu and Sun Corps, advancing south, entered Caocun Station at noon on the 28th and continued their southward advance beyond Caocun.</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Bengbu, 28th] The Zhang Gan Corps, advancing north from southern Henan, has reportedly reached a certain location, heading directly for Shangqiu, cutting off the bandit's rear.</p>
<h3 id="e2">Liu Zhi Flies to Bengbu and Returns to Xuzhou on the Same Day <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>

<p>[Special Dispatch from Bengbu, 28th] Liu Zhi arrived in Bengbu this afternoon on a special plane. It is reported that he will establish a command structure here. Part of the command staff arrived here this afternoon on two planes.</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Xuzhou, 28th] Liu Zhi flew over Suxian on the morning of the 28th to supervise the battle, boosting morale significantly. Liu also flew over the front lines of Suxian on the afternoon of the 27th to inspect the area.</p>

According to Du, speaking to reporters at the airport, the decisive battle in Central China is about to break out, and the crisis in Xuzhou itself has indeed passed. Du acknowledged that the railway line between Xuzhou and Nanjing has been cut in several places by the communist army, but stated that the rails and switches have not been removed, and traffic can be restored once the nearby communist army is driven away.</p>

<p>[Central News Agency Dispatch from Beiping, 28th] The North China Anti-Bandit Headquarters announced today (28th): Due to changes in the situation, Qinhuangdao and Shanhaiguan have now become two isolated and prominent strongholds, losing their strategic value.

<p>Leaflets Copied from Bandit Corpses: Liu Bandits Bitterly Condemn Chen Bandits for Fraud</p>
<p>[United Press Eastern Xuzhou Front, 28th] National Army generals today discovered leaflets again detailing the feud between Communist leaders Chen Yi and Liu Bocheng. Several papers were copied from the body of a soldier in Chen's unit, one of which stated: "Chen Yi said Liu wouldn't help him and said Liu wanted to surrender to the government. If Chen Yi stays, there will be even worse mistakes." Another paper stated: "Chen Yi deceived the Central Executive Committee of the Chinese Communist Party" and is a "shameless thing." It also stated: "Down with Chen Yi, who is fighting for power!" Another paper claimed Chen was a "person who drives soldiers to their deaths," carrying out "fraud and betrayal" for personal power. National Army generals pointed out that these leaflets were different from any leaflets the National Army distributed to the Communist Army, presumably self-generated by the Communist side.</p>

<h3 id="e9">The Yalta Agreement Sacrificed the Northeast; The United States Should Bear the Obligation to Aid China; Contents of President Chiang's Letter to Truman <a href="#e9" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c9" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">9</a></h3>
<p>[United Press Washington, 27th] President Chiang Kai-shek once told President Truman that due to the United States' diplomatic errors at the Yalta Conference, the United States now has the duty to assist China in countering the communists. Diplomatic officials disclosed on the 27th that in President Chiang's recent letter urging Truman to announce a policy of aid to China, he said that President Roosevelt's diplomacy at Yalta should be blamed for the subsequent fall of the Northeast to the communists. The Yalta Agreement, among other points, stipulated that China and the Soviet Union would jointly manage the two railways in the Northeast, the Kuril Islands would be handed over to the Soviet Union, and the Soviet Union would be encouraged to sign a Sino-Soviet "Treaty of Friendship and Alliance." Diplomatic sources said that President Chiang's letter attributed many of the difficulties of the National Government to the Yalta Agreement, with the Sino-Soviet Treaty being particularly important. According to the Sino-Soviet Treaty, the Soviet Union received many concessions in the Northeast from China. They said that President Chiang argued that China signed the Sino-Soviet Treaty, violating its own good judgment, only because it was bound by the United States' diplomacy at Yalta. It is said that President Chiang told Truman that the United States therefore has an obligation to assist the National Government in this current crisis. Neither President Chiang's request nor Truman's response has been made public. However, U.S. officials informally objected to President Chiang's argument, arguing that China's loss of the Northeast should be attributed to a lack of genuine will to fight the communists, improper use of weapons, and poor strategy.</p>
<h3 id="e10">U.S. Aid Gasoline Exports are Delayed in Many Ways; Congressman Walter Judd Criticizes the U.S. Department of Commerce <a href="#e10" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c10" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">10</a></h3>
<p>[United Press Washington, 28th] Congressman Walter Judd, a staunch supporter of U.S. aid to China, criticized the Department of Commerce on the 28th for delaying the approval of gasoline export quantities, saying, "Chinese Air Force planes can hardly take off because of it." Judd said that fortunately, the U.S. Air Force lent 60,000 barrels of gasoline to the Chinese Air Force, allowing Chinese planes to continue fighting "in the most critical stage." He said that the original intention of the U.S. Congress to allocate funds for military aid to China was almost completely negated by the delay. Judd said that the announcement of the gasoline quota for the third quarter to China was made in mid-August, when half of the quarter had already passed, and the Department of Commerce only approved half of what China requested. Judd said that Chinese officials confirmed to the State Department that there was no misconduct with U.S. oil companies, and that the Chinese government did not owe any money to U.S. oil exporters, yet it took weeks before the department approved additional exports again at the end of September.</p>

<p>[United Press Manila, 27th] U.S. Republican Senator Morrow arrived here tonight after inspecting China. He said: After talking with government officials and soldiers in China, I am fully convinced that the Soviet Union is providing military aid and military advisors to China. I support U.S. military aid to China at this time. Emergency aid is most effective in halting the communist advance. This aid should be managed directly by the U.S. government. The current expansion of communist power in China will not have a practical impact on the Philippines or other countries in the East. As a Pacific nation, the United States will never allow this to happen.</p>

<p>[Special Dispatch from Nanjing, 28th] Ministry of Finance News: The exchange rate for the half-open silver coins commonly used in Yunnan Province, which was previously approved by the Executive Yuan, regardless of quality, was uniformly exchanged at one gold yuan for one half-yuan Yunnan coin.

<p>[United Press Reporter Jacob's Special Dispatch from the Xuzhou Front, 28th] The only impression I gained on the Xuzhou front is that the officers and soldiers of the National Army defending Central China are in high spirits. They are willing to fight bravely at any time, which is the opposite of what people in the Shanghai and Nanjing area had expected. When the communist army attacked Xuzhou, neutral military observers in Shanghai and Nanjing shook their heads and sighed, believing that the communist army would definitely capture Xuzhou. They often said: The most important thing now is whether the National Army is willing to continue fighting. They also continued: The National Army's disastrous defeat in the Northeast and the communist army's victories in other areas may be a fatal blow to the morale of the National Army defending Central China. But what I have seen in the past two days on the southern and southeastern lines of Xuzhou proves that this concern is completely unfounded. The National Army is in high spirits and deeply believes that they will not fail. Especially on the southern front, twelve miles from Xuzhou, the National Army's uniforms are neat, their equipment is excellent, and there are many means of transportation (including motor vehicles and livestock). At the same time, the National Army is well aware that they will advance forward.</p>
<p>When the reporters passed by, they threw candies and other things at them. The Shanghai and Nanjing comfort groups also gave them other gifts. When we stopped to talk to them, they returned the favor with cigarettes. When a few soldiers carrying wounded soldiers on stretchers passed by, they didn't seem to mind.</p>
<p>At the same time, the National Army officers and generals I saw on the southern front were all confident, capable, and able to win the love of their subordinates, especially the lower-ranking officers.</p>
<p>[United Press Reporter Jacob's Special Dispatch from the Southern Xuzhou Front, 27th] I went to inspect a prominent National Army trench meeting place on the southern line of Xuzhou on the 27th. At this time, the National Army had advanced five kilometers the night before. This time, the National Army operated at night, reversing the usual practice, because the communist army always claimed that "night operations are theirs"?</p>
<p>As we advanced towards an area that had been occupied by the communist army just a few hours earlier, the strong and well-equipped infantry under General Sun Yuanliang were clearing out the communist army's salient positions on the hilltops facing us that had not been destroyed overnight. This army was constantly being reinforced by cheerful and energetic soldiers coming out from the rear. When they caught sight of the foreign reporter corps advancing towards the front line, many of them gave a thumbs up, meaning "excellent."</p>
<p>General Sun Yuanliang was a famous general who bravely resisted the Japanese in Zhabei in 1937. He firmly believes that he will be able to recapture Suxian, join forces with the National Army heading north, and shatter the communist army's attempt to completely encircle Xuzhou. Now that the communist army has turned to attack Bengbu in an attempt to threaten Nanjing, he will wipe them out in one fell swoop. I then asked him if he thought he could accomplish this task. General Sun replied in broken English: "Certainly!" "Certainly!"</p>

<p>[This City News] According to China National Aviation Corporation (CNAC) news: CNAC Vice Chairman Roosevelt, who flew from Shanghai to Xuzhou yesterday to inspect CNAC's business, and a group of people, including United Press reporter Effoyal and Continental Daily reporter Kingen-berg, who accompanied him to Xuzhou to visit the National Army's battle achievements, stayed in Xuzhou for one day and returned to Shanghai at 7:40 PM that afternoon. According to CNAC Secretary Wu Jingyan, who accompanied Roosevelt to Xuzhou to inspect business: In this battle, the communist army suffered extremely heavy casualties and lost all morale. The National Army fought bravely and has discouraged the communist army. The situation in Xuzhou has been extremely stable recently. The outside world's speculation about how tense and turbulent it is is completely without any trace. In the suburbs, one can often see farmers driving cattle in the sun, engaging in winter farming. Business transactions in the city are prosperous as usual. Some luxurious fashion stores have a lot of high-end Western suits and high-quality leather shoes displayed in the windows, attracting customers, but prices are on average about twice as high as in Shanghai. When he inspected the urban area, he saw citizens leisurely doing things on the streets, with no signs of panic or tension.</p>

<p>[Central News Agency This City News] Madame Chiang Kai-shek, accompanied by Zhu Shiming, head of our country's former delegation to Japan, You Jianwen, secretary to the president, and two attendants, took a U.S. military special plane from Jiangwan Airport here last night (28th) at 8:50 PM, heading to the U.S. Madame Chiang arrived in Shanghai on the evening of the 27th and went to Sun Yat-sen's wife's residence to bid farewell before departing last night. It is learned that Madame Chiang's mission is to visit the U.S. authorities to discuss the current situation in our country and will return to the country in the near future.</p>
<p>[United Press This City News] Madame Chiang flew to the U.S. from Jiangwan Airport at 8:50 PM tonight on a U.S. Navy four-engine transport plane. It is expected that she will stop briefly in Guam, but it is still unknown where she will land in the U.S. U.S. Army and Navy soldiers were heavily guarded at the airport, not allowing reporters to take pictures or talk to Madame Chiang.</p>
<p>[United Press Washington, 27th] It is generally speculated that Madame Chiang's visit to the U.S. is mainly to directly appeal to the American people for aid to China. Other aid-China movements are currently being promoted in the United States, and their effects may be greater than Madame Chiang's. The organized movement is launched by the Christian group "Christ's Resurrection Society" and the WFMV radio station in Allentown, Pennsylvania. The New York headquarters of "Christ's Resurrection Society" has issued a notice to its members, asking them to write letters or telegrams to President Truman and members of Congress, asking them to strengthen aid to China as soon as possible. WFMV radio station has sent 2,500 letters to other radio stations, asking them to ask listeners to express their opinions on immediately and fully adopting aid-China measures to Truman and Congress.</p>

<p>[This Newspaper News] At 3:00 PM yesterday afternoon, President Sun Yat-Sen held a tea party at his official residence, inviting responsible persons of important social organizations and university presidents in this city. Those who were invited to attend included Du Yuesheng, Qian Xinzhi, Pan Gongzhan, Xu Jiguan, Wang Xiaolai, Liu Hongsheng, Cheng Cangbo, Jiang Yiping, Feng Youzhen, Xu Yongzuo, Zhou Xuexiang, Hu Dunfu, Zhang Yi, Hu Wenyao, Ouyuan Huai, Zhao Dihua, Chuan Mubo, Zhou Feicheng, Luo Dunwei, Cheng Shewo, Fan Zhengbo, Xu Kejun, Xu Xinyu, Ren Jinpin, Zhang Huiwen, and more than twenty others. They exchanged opinions frankly on current national affairs, and the meeting did not end until 5:30 PM. It is reported that President Sun Yat-Sen will be admitted to the hospital last night or this morning to treat his foot ailment, so his entry into Beijing to form a cabinet will inevitably have to wait for a few days.</p>
<p>At yesterday's tea party, President Sun Yat-Sen first explained that he was ordered to form a cabinet this time, but he could not refuse. He could only do his best for the country on the basis of cooperation with the people. The nature of the communist bandits' rebellion against the country and the government's suppression of the rebellion is by no means a partisan dispute or an ordinary civil war. It is actually an anti-aggression war to resist the Fifth Column of the Communist International. The life and death of the country and nation depend on it, and the people of the whole country and the government should share the responsibility. Shanghai's position is important, and the actions of its citizens are especially worthy of being an example for the whole country. Therefore, I am very willing to ask you for advice before taking office. In the past, the government may have had policy errors or low administrative efficiency, but in the future, it will humbly listen to the people's valuable opinions, reform the procedures of administrative organs, and strive to improve efficiency. The first is to strive for military victory, and the second is to relieve the suffering of the people. I deeply hope that you will also regard the government as the people's own government and wholeheartedly contribute your strength, which will surely achieve the effect of saving ourselves and saving the country. As for strengthening U.S. aid, it should not be a problem in principle. We only need to make efforts to help ourselves first and discuss specific methods with the United States in a frank and sincere spirit. At the same time, we can cooperate closely with the U.S. military advisors and the Economic Cooperation Administration, adopt their suggestions, make good use of their materials, and increase our work efficiency, which can make the U.S. government and people look at us with new eyes and be willing to strengthen their assistance. If the United States has any expectations of our country that we should and can do, we should quickly and earnestly implement them. For example: (1) The recommendations of the military advisory group should be implemented immediately if they are feasible, and the reasons should be explained if they are truly inconvenient to implement, so that they can understand. We only seek to strengthen U.S. aid and make the work of the advisory group more practical. (2) U.S. aid materials are shipped directly from U.S. ports to major coastal or Yangtze River ports in our country by foreign ships, and export materials are loaded and shipped directly to the U.S. at the unloading port when they return. This method saves time and labor, reduces transportation costs, and has a specific time limit. It is not used to transport goods and passengers between ports in our country, so there is no meaning of opening up inland river navigation rights. In the future, the government must act immediately on matters that are beneficial to the country and respect the reasonable opinions of the people. The government will never compromise with the communist bandits and will fight to the final victory. I deeply hope that the people of Shanghai will rise up automatically, contribute money and effort, and save themselves and save the country.</p>

The main points are as follows: (1) It is hoped that the government will earnestly refresh its lineup and improve its policies, and especially establish a genuine foundation for a "responsible cabinet" in a constitutional country, to share the burden for the President, so that this progressive system can refresh the people's ears and eyes. (2) Under the principle of military first, thoroughly eradicate old malpractices, improve logistics operations, increase soldiers' treatment, and thoroughly reform the grain requisition and conscription systems in light of reality, to alleviate the suffering of farmers. (3) Quickly and universally implement land reform, gradually achieve equalization of land ownership, so that farmers can own their farmland. (4) Further express our country's firm anti-communist diplomatic stance in the international arena, quickly and diligently obtain US aid, and adopt foreign advisors' suggestions as much as possible. (5) The excessive control policies and economic police system in the economic field should be abolished immediately; there should be a clear boundary between state-owned enterprises and private enterprises, and "competing with the people for profit" should never be the goal of state-owned enterprises. (6) Improve the treatment of civil servants, thoroughly strengthen their efficiency, so that the efficiency of government agencies is the same as that of private industrial and commercial enterprises. (7) In the rear provinces and cities, private and foreign investment should be encouraged to engage in various productive enterprises, eliminating all unnecessary restrictions, in order to increase production and stabilize people's livelihood. (8) The people of Shanghai should stand on the position of supporting the government, strengthen their self-defense forces, maintain order, stabilize society, and work hard to relieve refugees and comfort soldiers and wounded soldiers.</p>

<h3 id="e20">Protest Against Siam's Restriction on Overseas Chinese Entering the Country <a href="#e20" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c20" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">20</a></h3>
<p>Just as Thailand is arresting overseas Chinese on a large scale and imposing all kinds of restrictions on overseas Chinese education and industrial and commercial activities, Siamese Prime Minister Plaek Phibunsongkhram suddenly announced the implementation of a "non-discriminatory immigration quota system," stipulating that starting next year, foreign immigrants will be limited to 200 people across the board. After the announcement of this new measure, our government immediately protested based on reason, and the overseas Chinese in Thailand also expressed dissatisfaction with this unreasonable restriction. Recently, the Siamese government decided to adopt the recommendation of the Immigration Special Committee of the Ministry of Interior, namely, to change the annual quota for Chinese immigrants to 500 people, in order to express its "concession." In fact, this method of restricting the entry of overseas Chinese is a bad measure that violates the Sino-Siamese Treaty of Friendship and hinders the long-standing relations between China and Thailand. The implementation of this restrictive policy by the Plaek Phibunsongkhram government is a misjudgment on the part of Plaek Phibunsongkhram. Our public opinion not only wants to protest this unreasonable measure, but also to correct this misjudgment of Plaek Phibunsongkhram.</p>
<p>The historical relationship between China and Thailand has lasted for 1,600 years. The old friendship between China and Thailand is peaceful and courteous. This is clearly recorded in the history of China and Thailand and is well-documented. In recent times, the relationship between China and Thailand has been isolated and unfriendly. This was all caused by Plaek Phibunsongkhram single-handedly, to the point of being irreparable. Before the war, Plaek Phibunsongkhram used anti-Chinese sentiment as a rallying cry, which plunged Thailand's national fortune into a tragic abyss. After the war, the Allied Powers did not settle Plaek Phibunsongkhram's war criminal suspicions, allowing him to regain his conscious reason and become a good person again. After the "January 18th" incident last year, Plaek Phibunsongkhram regained control of the military and then replaced Khuang Aphaiwong's regime with a "bloodless revolution." After Plaek Phibunsongkhram came to power, he relapsed into his old ways. In particular, his anti-Chinese policies were performed most brilliantly. First, the Siamese government closed overseas Chinese schools, banned the hanging of the Chinese national flag, restricted overseas Chinese children from receiving education from their motherland, and imposed various restrictions on overseas Chinese teachers. After the start of the autumn semester this year, 4,000 overseas Chinese children returned to China to study. Although all 500 overseas Chinese schools in Thailand have now been allowed to open, there are many technical problems, which is equivalent to not being able to operate them. Secondly, regarding the restrictions on overseas Chinese engaging in industrial and commercial activities, the Siamese Democratic Party drafted a plan to restrict the free development of overseas Chinese, the form of which is very similar to that previously formulated by the Philippines. The plan stipulates that overseas Chinese shops and warehouses must hire Siamese people as deputy managers, and the number of Siamese people employed must not be less than 50%. Thirdly, the number of "bad elements" among overseas Chinese who have been arrested is also astonishing. Sixty-three people were arrested on June 15 alone, and 52 people were deported. On August 10, about 300 people were arrested, plunging the 3 million overseas Chinese in Thailand into a state of panic and uncertainty.</p>
<p>Implemented at the same time as the above-mentioned anti-Chinese measures is the restriction on the entry of overseas Chinese. In August of this year, a new harsh regulation was promulgated to increase the deportation of overseas Chinese, stipulating that 30 types of occupations would be banned, causing some overseas Chinese to be forced to leave the country. The Siamese government believes that restricting the occupations of overseas Chinese is not enough, and recently promulgated an immigration quota system, restricting the entry of overseas Chinese to a maximum of 500 people per year. This is undoubtedly an unreasonable and unilateral regulation. It is reported that our government has lodged representations with the Siamese government. Standing on the position of friendly relations between China and Thailand, in addition to protesting this unprecedented immigration restriction policy, we also hope to correct this misjudgment of Plaek Phibunsongkhram from the perspective of human reason.</p>
<p>First, the founding of Siam is closely and significantly related to the entry of overseas Chinese. In the past, Siam was a desolate place. Overseas Chinese prospered Siam's industry and commerce and opened up vast agricultural land. The modern history of Siam is full of the blood and tears of overseas Chinese, and overseas Chinese have never asked for political rewards. The Siamese people have Chinese blood, but overseas Chinese have insulted their descendants since childhood. In short, the 3 million overseas Chinese are kind people. They live passively and only seek to live and work in peace and contentment, without any sense of superiority. They need a sense of security for survival and freedom in life. This depends on the Sino-Siamese Treaty of Friendship to guarantee it, and the rationality of Siamese politicians to guarantee it.</p>
<p>Second, before the establishment of modern Sino-Siamese relations, Chinese people entered Siam freely. In recent times, this free entry has been restricted, but the scale of the restrictions should be relaxed to be considered a reasonable restriction and a restriction that does not violate reason. According to statistics from the ten years before the war (i.e., 1927 to 1936), the average annual number of Chinese people entering Siam exceeded the number of people leaving Siam by about 18,000. After the war, our ambassador to Thailand, Li Tieh-cheng, and Siamese Prime Minister Khuang Aphaiwong agreed that the future quota should be based on the average population of the 15 years from 1927 to 1941, stipulating that 14,000 Chinese people could enter Siam each year. This is a common code of conduct for China and Thailand and does not become invalid due to the change of the Siamese regime. Therefore, the regulation of the Plaek Phibunsongkhram government that restricts the number to 500 people is very unreasonable. If the Siamese government breaks its previous promise and violates diplomatic norms, what good-neighborly relations can there be between countries in the future? This point needs the special vigilance and caution of the Siamese government.</p>
<p>We point out the above two points, hoping that the Siamese government will accept our well-intentioned advice; at the same time, we call on our government to pay attention to diplomacy with Thailand. In the past, diplomacy with Thailand was too perfunctory, causing overseas Chinese to suffer. It is extremely sad to say. Our people are filled with grief and indignation at the plight of overseas Chinese in Thailand, and we hope that the government will take action quickly, in addition to protesting, to correct the misjudgment of the Siamese government.</p>

We are honored to have you come together to represent the people of the rear and extend your sincere condolences. Both the material and spiritual aspects are perfect. However, defending the country is the duty of soldiers. Achieving victory depends on the cooperation of all sectors. In addition to our gratitude, we are even more ashamed. Thinking of the treacherous bandits and international conspiracies, the hatred is so great that the whole country is indignant. We are fighting for anti-aggression and it concerns the survival of the nation. We should be of one heart and one mind, continue to work hard, wipe out the bandit scourge, and permanently secure China. We still ask you not to neglect us from afar and give us your supervision and guidance from time to time. In addition to instructing the three armies to publicize the grand occasion, we respectfully express our gratitude."</p>

We are grateful to you for braving the cold and coming from afar to visit our corps and bring us warmth and generous rewards. This proves that the people in the rear are with us."

<p>[Our Newspaper Nanjing 28th Electric] Regarding the method of improving the treatment of public school teachers, the Executive Yuan has submitted it to the Legislative Yuan for investigation in accordance with the resolution of the 26th political affairs meeting on the 24th.

<h3 id="e43">Enhance Coal Sources in Central and Southern China The Three Coal Mines in Jiangxi, Hunan, and Guangdong Formulate Production Goals and Actively Develop Equipment <a href="#e43" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c43" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">43</a></h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Nanjing 28th Electric] The Resources Committee believes that the coal used in the Beijing-Shanghai area and South China mostly relies on the supply of the Kailuan, Huadong, and Huainan mines. However, the transportation problem of transporting coal from the north to the south is not easy to solve. Now, the committee has set the construction of coal mines in Central and Southern China as its central task for the future. Among them, the quality of the three mines in Ganxi (i.e., Pingxiang), Huxiang, and Nanling is good. In recent years, human and material resources have been concentrated to focus on development, and American experts have been hired to conduct on-site surveys and assist in planning, and to formulate the ultimate production goals. Ganxi will produce 4,500 tons per day, Huxiang will produce 2,500 tons, and Nanling will produce 500 tons. The entire plan is scheduled to be completed in three years.</p>
<p>Ganxi</p>
<p>Ganxi has Anyuan and Gaokeng mines under its jurisdiction. Anyuan is reorganizing and expanding the old mines, and plans to produce 1,000 tons per day in the future. Gaokeng is a new factory, and plans to produce 3,500 tons of coal per day. There is now a branch line of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway that directly reaches the factory. The two new large mines that the factory has dug are each more than 800 feet deep, and the main coal seams can be seen. It is planned that the latest method will be used to mine coal from these two wells. The power plant built this year has completed a capacity of 1,000 kilowatts and has already generated electricity. There is still 3,000 kilowatts of equipment that is being installed and is expected to be completed within next year. In addition, in order to meet future needs, it is planned to add 10,000 kilowatts of power generation equipment. The remaining mining, repair, washing, and other equipment materials have been proposed in the US aid plan. If they can be gradually realized, the coal source in Central China will not only be enhanced in the future, but it can also be used as a model mine to train technical personnel.</p>
<p>Huxiang</p>
<p>The Huxiang Coal Mine currently uses self-built roads to transport coal, and the output is limited. In the future, a large amount of coal will be produced, and the repair of the Hunan-Guizhou Railway is urgently needed. The strata in the mining area contain a lot of water, and the existing equipment is limited. The factory has adopted electric drainage, and the power source is temporarily supplied by the Xiangmei Power Plant. In the future, a large increase in production will require the cooperation of US aid equipment.</p>
<p>Nanling</p>
<p>The production plan for Nanling is 500 tons per day. The current maximum daily output is 160 tons. After the completion and opening of the Nanling branch line of the Guangdong-Han Railway next spring, it is planned to gradually expand to 400 tons. If the source of funds is guaranteed and the project is advanced on schedule, the output can reach 500 tons per day in the 39th year. In the future, it should be expanded again to 1,000 tons per day depending on the needs.</p>

<p>Construction Scheduled to Begin Next Spring</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Guangzhou, 28th] The Wengjiang Hydropower Project has recently had personnel jointly dispatched by the National Resources Commission (NRC) and the Guangdong Provincial Government to survey the dam site, and construction is scheduled to begin next spring. This project is of great importance to the development of industry and agriculture in South China. Before and during the war, Siemens Corporation, the NRC Hydropower Development, and the Surveying Corps conducted research on it. After the war, the National Hydropower Engineering Administration dispatched a team to plan it. Mr. Gordon, former chief engineer of the U.S. Federal Power Commission and hydropower engineer for the NRC, also studied it. From five planned locations, the Youshukeng site was selected as the plant site. Initially, it is planned to install two 20,000-kilowatt generators, with an initial total capacity of 90,000 kilowatts. In the second phase, two more 20,000-kilowatt generators will be added, generating a total of 80,000 kilowatts. After the plan is completed, electricity can be transmitted to Guangzhou. The entire project is expected to take about five years to complete. The generating machinery will all come from the United States, requiring US$3,931,000 in foreign exchange. Other domestically produced materials and labor costs will total approximately 18.5 million Gold Yuan.</p>

<h3 id="e50">U.S. Must Adopt Effective Measures to Change the Situation in China; Reforms Should Be Implemented Later: A Just Argument from Renowned San Francisco Columnist Lawrence <a href="#e50" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c50" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">50</a></h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, San Francisco, 27th] Renowned San Francisco Oakland Tribune columnist Lawrence recently wrote an article in the newspaper on November 24th, entitled: "China in the Short Term and Long Term." The gist of it is: "After listening to several university professors discuss the Chinese crisis for several hours, I immediately swept away the pessimistic ideas. We must put our heart and soul into thinking about this problem. The deductions of academics, no matter how intellectually fascinating, are of no great help in dealing with the current situation. Most of us cannot distinguish between China's short-term and long-term goals. Americans have discussed the Communist Party's influence on agricultural areas, and the factional struggles and corruption in Chinese politics, but they are all half-truths and may not be entirely correct. Some of them are forcing them to conform to the facts out of preconceived notions, and others are measuring China's situation with their own American experience. We do not deny that China urgently needs social and economic reforms, but we must recognize the significant impact of the eight-year war of resistance against Japan, and the tremendous pressure currently exerted by fighting the Communist Party. This long-term conflict should also include the war against Japan in the Northeast, which began in 1931. Impatient and overly idealistic Americans often fail to consider the short history of Chinese nationalism's development, and the fluctuations caused by the influence of Western industrialism and cultural thought in China. China will not suddenly change again with innovation, and the future new China will not be completely the same as Western countries. The new China will be a mixture of old and new forces, just like how barbarian peoples, Roman culture, and Christian churches created a brand new civilization. This is a slow and step-by-step historical process, and reforms to promote this process will become a long-term plan. But the current problem is of a short-term nature, and its purpose must be to preserve the various conditions that allow China to be free. Lawrence continued to discuss the Communist Party's plan, the similarities between the Chinese Communist Party and Marxists, and the relationship between Mao Zedong and the Cominform. He said: No matter what concessions the Chinese Communist Party may be forced to make to the domestic situation, their direction towards the goal of world communism will not be affected. And these two points are the main concerns of the United States, which will threaten our security in the Pacific region. This must be the basis of our short-term policy. Any reforms we can encourage or support must be implemented later. What must be done first is to put out the raging fire. We can take some effective and immediate military measures to change the current situation in China, and if China agrees, we can at least take an economic measure. Our economic experts estimate that if Chinese bankers cooperate with our experts, only a relatively small sum of money is needed to stabilize Chinese currency, which can have a great impact on China's economy. The above are only short-term measures and are not intended to solve China's problems. Their purpose is only to maintain the various conditions that allow China to decide its own destiny."</p>

<h3 id="e51">UN Resolution Demands Southern Balkans Stop Aiding Greek Guerrillas, Resolve Outstanding Issues Peacefully <a href="#e51" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c51" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">51</a></h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 27th] The United Nations General Assembly today discussed the Greek issue in detail and approved the recommendations passed by the Political Committee. The General Assembly approved the joint proposal of the United States, Britain, France, and China by a vote of 47 to 6 (Slavic countries), and rejected the Soviet proposal to withdraw foreign troops stationed in Greece and reduce the powers of the Balkan Committee by a vote of 47 to 6. The proposal put forward by the United States, Britain, France, and China demanded that Albania, Yugoslavia, and Bulgaria immediately cease aiding Greek guerrillas, cooperate with the Greek government to resolve outstanding issues between countries peacefully, and do their best to assist the work of the United Nations Balkan Investigation Committee. The United Nations General Assembly also unanimously passed some clauses of the Soviet proposal, requesting Greece, Albania, and Bulgaria to establish diplomatic relations, and requiring the four governments to resolve border and refugee issues in a spirit of mutual understanding. At the afternoon meeting of the United Nations General Assembly, French Foreign Minister Schuman said that the French government agreed with the four governments' proposal on the Greek issue. Schuman strongly argued that the United Nations should not interfere in Greece's internal affairs. U.S. representative Dulles then spoke, saying that the United States fully supported the report of the Balkan Committee and hoped that the negotiations between Greece and its northern neighbors, currently chaired by Ivatt and Lie, could be successful. Ukrainian representative Manuilsky criticized Britain and the United States for interfering in Greece's internal affairs and supported the Soviet proposal for the immediate withdrawal of foreign troops. The UN General Assembly finally unanimously passed a recommendation that Greek children currently abroad should have the opportunity to return to Greece immediately.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Paris, 27th] Chinese representative Jiang Tingfu spoke in support of most of the proposals on the Greek issue. He warned the United Nations General Assembly to pay attention to the danger of "indirect aggression," saying that this is where the core of the world peace problem lies. Jiang said, "The most pressing issue facing the world today is not direct aggression but indirect aggression."</p>
<h3 id="e52">Berlin City Elections to Be Held as Scheduled, The Shadow of East-West Division Is Inevitable, British Side Denies West Germany is Training Militias <a href="#e52" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c52" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">52</a></h3>
<p>[United Press, Berlin, 28th] The Berlin municipal election will begin on December 5th, and over a million Germans will participate in the vote, which will affect the whole world, as it is a struggle between Soviet totalitarianism and Western democracy. After the election, Berlin may be formally split into two cities. The Soviet Union has banned voting in its territory, so only Germans within the British, American, and French sectors will participate.</p>
<p>Franklyn, Political Chief of the U.S. Military Government, said: "The election makes the Soviet Union very unhappy. The Soviet Union understands the anti-Soviet sentiment of Berlin citizens, so it will never politically commit suicide by allowing a free vote." The purpose of the election is to elect city councilors. Originally, it was only necessary to elect less than 30 seats, but due to the Soviet boycott, it is planned to elect 98 people. The West believes that every person who votes is one more person against Soviet-style totalitarianism. If the weather is good, officials estimate that 85 percent of citizens will participate in the vote, about 1.5 million people. If the weather is bad, the number will be greatly affected. West Berlin police will be deployed, especially in areas bordering the East, but it is not expected that there will be systematic communist riots. To date, five municipal departments have been forced to move from the Soviet sector to West Berlin. Western officials believe that the Soviet Union will force every institution to withdraw when the voting is completed. A few days ago, German police in the Soviet zone surrounded the city hall and prevented documents from being moved out. The three major anti-communist parties are campaigning quietly, and the Soviet Union is obstructing Germans from voting in thousands of ways.</p>
<p>[United Press, Berlin, 27th] According to the British-registered news agency, Marshal Sokolovsky, commander-in-chief of the Soviet occupation forces in Germany, convened a meeting of senior officials to discuss the establishment of a separate municipal government in the Soviet sector of Berlin. According to the agency, this information comes from well-informed sources close to the Soviet military government, saying that Sokolovsky has ordered the Berlin City Council to move out of the City Hall building in the Soviet sector before the October 5th city election. However, Allied officials have not confirmed the news that the Soviet Union will establish a separate municipal government in the Soviet sector after December 5th or even before. According to the German news agency registered in the U.S., the Soviet military court sentenced Dr. McKenbock, chairman of the Berlin Coal Rationing Committee, to three months and twenty-five days in prison for disobeying the Soviet authorities. The term began on August 1st, so McKenbock was released on the 27th. At the same time, the Soviet occupation forces' newspaper, "Daily Review," insisted that if the United States continues to adhere to its current foreign policy, it "will inevitably lead to a new war."</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Düsseldorf, 27th] A British military spokesman in the Rhineland today denied the German writer Kang Gang's statement that the British and American authorities are establishing a German national army in West Germany. According to Kang Gang, the training of this militia began nine months ago. The British military spokesman completely denied this. He also said that the British military authorities have never considered training German youth. After Kang Gang's sensational remarks were published, there was much discussion in the streets and alleys here. Kang Gang said that the British and American authorities are planning to rebuild the West German army in response to the Soviet Union's establishment of a strong police force in its occupation zone. The Christian Democratic Union's "Rheinische Post" said that rebuilding the West German army would be like playing with fire. Although the West German army could strengthen our international position, we believe that if Germany must participate in another war, Germany should participate on an equal footing. Otherwise, the trained German youth will become mercenaries hired by others. If the German national army defends the Rhineland, then German youth will undoubtedly be sacrificed as cannon fodder.</p>

<p>Rumored to Be Valid for 50 Years</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, London, 27th] According to semi-official sources, the Permanent Commission of the Five Brussels Treaty countries has drafted the Atlantic Treaty. The draft will be immediately submitted to the governments of Britain, France, Belgium, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg. Qualified observers expect that the five governments will approve it, and after the five governments approve it, the ambassadors of the five countries to the United States and the Canadian ambassador to the United States will submit it to the U.S. State Department. Officials here refused to disclose the contents of the draft treaty, but some reports say that the draft provisions include France's proposal stipulating that the treaty is valid for 50 years. Informed sources also said that the meeting between the Brussels Treaty and the seven countries of the United States and Canada may be held in Washington in half a month to continue discussing the draft Atlantic Treaty.</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, New Delhi, 27th] It is learned that the Congress Party members of the Constituent Assembly have authorized Prime Minister Nehru to continue negotiating India's ties with the Commonwealth based on citizenship and non-alignment.

<p>[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 28th] Prime Minister Yoshida met with Speaker Matsuoka of the House of Representatives in the Speaker's office on the 28th, requesting the House to order the arrest of former Democratic Party President Hitoshi Ashida.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Tokyo, 28th] The Tokyo District Prosecutor requested the parliament on the 28th to allow the arrest of former Prime Minister and Democratic Party leader Hitoshi Ashida. Ashida's cabinet was forced to resign on October 7 after two of its cabinet members, Nishio of the Socialist Party and Kurisu of the Democratic Party, were arrested for involvement in the Showa Denko bribery case.</p>
<p>Informed sources at the time said that Hinohara, the manager of Showa Denko, misused over $2 million in public funds. It was rumored that Ashida had received a bribe of 1 million yen (approximately over $30,000). Ashida's private secretary was arrested some time ago, which at the time led some observers to believe that Ashida's arrest was imminent. However, because the prosecutor handled the case extremely slowly and very cautiously, fearing that it would affect the Democratic Party leader before the election, it has not been implemented. However, today there has been a sudden turn for the worse. The prosecutor today requested the parliament to allow the arrest of Ashida himself and two other members, Kita and Kawahashi, because the parliament is currently in session and members enjoy privileges.</p>

<h3 id="e57">Japan to Draft New Laws to Prevent Communist Party Activities <a href="#e57" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c57" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">57</a></h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 27th] A person close to the Japanese cabinet informed the Central News Agency today that the Japanese government has recently completed a draft of a new law granting officials of the Special Investigation Bureau under the Ministry of Justice broad discretionary powers to investigate and arrest subversives without restriction. The person also said that this new law will expand the scope of the Bureau's activities to include the investigation and prevention of Communist Party or left-leaning activities. According to current laws, the task of the Investigation Bureau is mainly limited to the preventative or cautionary investigation of right-leaning militant groups or extremist nationalist groups and their activities, and to investigate the activities of purged individuals and former military officers. However, the new law stipulates that 365 officials of the Special Investigation Bureau will be permitted to investigate, search, or arrest suspects of subversive acts, to be handled at the discretion of each official.</p>
<p>It is learned that Imperial Ordinance No. 101, on which the Bureau officials base their activities, requires them to obtain an arrest warrant from the Ministry of Justice before taking any action. The new law stipulates that this procedure is not necessary. According to the reliable source, the Bureau officials have long felt the need to have discretionary power to immediately search, seize, or detain. It is said that it is not uncommon for suspects of subversive activities to destroy evidence or even escape during the time it takes to issue an arrest warrant. It is also said that the reason for expanding the Bureau's task to investigate left-leaning individuals, just as right-leaning individuals are investigated, is because "Communist Party malfeasance has increased." It is pointed out that in the past three years, the occupation forces and the Japanese government have been strict and precise in suppressing and eradicating right-leaning groups, but there has been little active action against left-leaning individuals, resulting in greater freedom and impunity, which has completely broken the balance between the two extremes, and the position of the left-leaning forces has increased daily. The new law will also force a large number of various associations and companies to register with the Ministry of Justice. Currently, the number of registered associations is about 4,500, which are mainly organizations engaged in political activities. This law requires cultural and economic organizations, even those with slight political overtones, to register like fully political organizations, and the number of registrations will increase to over 10,000.</p>

<p>[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 28th] The deadlock in the Japanese Diet over the amendment to the Civil Service Law, after MacArthur Headquarters hinted that it was inseparable from the supplementary budget bill, Prime Minister Yoshida has ordered the Ministry of Finance to rush to compile the supplementary budget. However, the passage of this bill and the budget bill cannot be considered as a solution to tomorrow's political struggle. On the contrary, a fierce political struggle will begin in three or four days. Regarding the issue of deliberating the budget bill, Chief Cabinet Secretary Sato told reporters: "The submission and discussion of this budget bill is entirely a matter of political relations. Although there are only two days left for discussion, it is not without hope of passing."</p>

(4) Reviewing reports on Japan, Korea, and the general situation in the Far East.</p>

<p>A Great Victory for the Queuille Government</p>
<p>[United Press, Paris, 28th] The Miners' Federation of the French General Confederation of Labor ordered all striking coal miners on the 28th to return to work on the 29th. The miners' major strike began on October 4th and has been weakening in recent weeks. Eighty percent of the total number of workers now report to work daily. In officially announcing the end of the strike, the union said that it must "reorganize its forces to continue the fight in other areas." It also said: "This struggle is by no means in vain. If we surrender without resistance, it will cause a serious mistake." Approximately 350,000 coal miners were on strike, and France lost 5 million tons of coal. The government was forced to divert oil and other funds to purchase and import emergency coal. The collapse of the strike is a great victory for the Queuille government.</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 27th (Associated Press)] Far East representatives attending the World Food and Agriculture Organization conference here feel that international financial organizations should consider how to exert their best efforts to resolve the financial situation that hinders food production and affects the livelihoods of millions of people. It is reliably learned that the Far East Committee's report will include this suggestion. The World Food and Agriculture Organization General Assembly will take action on the Far East Committee's report, completed this week, at a meeting before the General Assembly concludes on the 29th. Representatives from Far Eastern countries stated that member nations of the World Food and Agriculture Organization and international financial organizations must immediately consider the purchasing difficulties caused by the lack of funds in various countries, and the so-called foreign exchange chaos in various countries.</p>

He stated that France's request for appropriate guarantees to prevent the Ruhr area from being used for war preparations again can certainly be satisfied by the United States and Britain. He stated, "The United States and Britain have absolutely no intention of allowing Germany to rearm and threaten France again, so they will provide the greatest guarantees." However, the official did not mention what the so-called "security guarantees" would be. It is generally believed that even after the conclusion of the peace treaty with Germany and the withdrawal of most of the occupying forces, the Allied forces will still occupy some key areas of Germany. It is reported that France insists on continuing the occupation, claiming that this is part of the agreement reached by the three countries in June.</p>

<p>[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 27th] Argentine Foreign Minister Bramuglia continued his private talks today in a final effort to find a way to break the deadlock in Berlin. Bramuglia met with Soviet representative Jessup this afternoon and hopes to visit Soviet representative Vyshinsky tonight or tomorrow morning, and also plans to meet with French representative Parodi and British representative Meidegan.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Paris, 28th] U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Thorp declared at a press conference on the 28th that the United States is still willing to negotiate the withdrawal of the Deutsche Mark issued by the West from Berlin, but only after the Soviet Union lifts the blockade of Berlin. At the same time, a senior U.S. official warned that if the Berlin crisis cannot be resolved immediately, there may be no hope of resolution in a few days. Security Council Chairman Argentine Foreign Minister Bramuglia is making a final attempt to draft a compromise plan that can be accepted by the three Western countries and the Soviet Union before his term as chairman expires on the 30th. However, his efforts seem doomed to failure. The West believes that an agreement may not be possible until the Soviet Union stops its movement to split the city of Berlin and all parties begin to unify the Berlin municipal administration. Thorp stated that the rumors that the United States has withdrawn from the decision to use the four-power agreement of August 30 in Moscow as the basis for negotiations are not true. The four-power agreement recognizes the Deutsche Mark issued by the Soviet Union as the only currency in Berlin, and the Soviet Union lifts the blockade of Berlin. The details are then handed over to the four-power military governors for discussion. Afterwards, the governors' meeting broke up unhappily. Thorp admitted that the United States and Britain may have slight differences of opinion on the solution to the currency issue, but there is absolutely no fundamental split. A senior Western official stated that the Berlin situation is deteriorating rapidly. If it cannot be resolved immediately, Berlin will inevitably be divided into two. He also said that although the West still believes that an agreement can be reached, if the status quo does not change, there is no hope that the Soviet Deutsche Mark will ever become the only currency in Berlin.</p>

<p>[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 27th] British and American representatives, as well as representatives from France and other countries, are currently discussing the issue of former Italian colonies behind the scenes at the United Nations General Assembly. Britain and the United States agree that the former Italian colonies should be placed under United Nations trusteeship, and request that Britain administer Cyrenaica on their behalf. Italy would administer Italian Somaliland. France has expressed opposition to the decision of Abyssinia to administer Eritrea on their behalf. Due to the Arab demand for the independence of Tripolitania, Britain and the United States have not yet made a decision on the disposition of the area. In view of the fact that the current session of the United Nations General Assembly will soon end, the issue of Italian colonies may be reserved for discussion at a special session of the United Nations General Assembly next spring.</p>

<h3 id="e68">Private Primary and Secondary School Teachers Decide to Resume Teaching Today; Officially Return to Work After Living Standards Are Guaranteed <a href="#e68" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c68" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">68</a></h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] The Liaison Association of Private Secondary School Teachers in this city held a meeting of representatives from various schools yesterday afternoon, resolving to temporarily resume work starting today and to officially return to work after living standards are guaranteed. The meeting also resolved that regarding the increase in tuition fees for private schools this time, the mayor has approved the collection of one to three times the original amount. Schools that have already overcharged should have the principals return the overcharged amount to the students. At the same time, the Liaison Association of Private Primary School Teachers also held a meeting of directors and supervisors yesterday morning, deciding to accept the mayor's advice and temporarily resume work starting today. However, regarding the issue of in-kind rations, it was decided to send representatives to strongly fight for this with the authorities, believing that there should be no distinction between public and private school teachers in enjoying rations.</p>
<p>[Another report] The distribution of woolen yarn to private schools began on the 27th. Secondary schools have already received it, and primary schools and vocational schools will complete the process within the next month.</p>
<p>In addition, private primary and secondary school teacher's union employee's direct family member investigation forms should be filled out in duplicate again according to the original format and sent to the Personnel Office of the Education Bureau for application.</p>

<p>Since the teachers of private secondary schools in this city used the method of a general leave of absence to obtain the approval of Mayor Wu to increase the second tuition fee by one to three times in various private primary and secondary schools, it has already aroused dissatisfaction and resentment among the majority of people from all walks of life, including parents of various schools and senators. They believe that the principals can only ask the students and alumni for subsidies, or solicit donations from the students' parents in the name of "respecting teachers," but they cannot make mandatory regulations. Moreover, according to the provisions of the Civil Code, after the students' parents agree to the fees stipulated in the private school's charter and pay them at one time, it is tantamount to the establishment of a "contract" agreed upon by both parties. The schools cannot refuse the "contract" that has been agreed upon and fulfilled for any reason, and collect a second tuition fee. The third party administrative authority cannot interfere or change the "contract" that has been agreed upon by both parties by order. Therefore, several senators and people's organizations will jointly file a protest with Mayor Wu to oppose this illegal measure taken by the government and various private primary and secondary schools.</p>
<h3 id="e70">Senator Jiang Submits Interpellations and Asks the Mayor to Answer Eight Points <a href="#e70" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c70" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">70</a></h3>
<p>City Senator Jiang Huaisu issued a statement yesterday saying; after reading the report on the 26th of this month that Mayor Wu rejected the four demands of private schools, it can be said to be legal and reasonable, but after a day, the report on the 27th stated that Mayor Wu convened a meeting of private school principals and indicated that it could be increased by one to three times. Because these are all news reports, it is not certain whether this is true. I can only ask the mayor to explain the following interpellations in detail:</p>
<p>(1) When the autumn semester began this year, the calculation of tuition fees was based on the prices at the time, calculated at one time, which was enough for half a year, and poor parents requested to pay in two installments, which the schools absolutely refused to do, so I don't know how many people dropped out of school? Now the schools say that there is not enough expenditure, and the teachers say that they cannot live. Should this responsibility be borne by the parents?</p>
<p>(2) The gold yuan coupons paid by parents this semester are worth one tael of gold, which is exchanged for 200 gold yuan coupons. The price limit is from August 19 to October 31, which is also a long period of 74 days. Why did the principals and teachers have no planned use for half a year's expenses and living expenses? If it is said that it is because the gold yuan coupons have depreciated, please ask who is responsible for the depreciation of the gold yuan coupons, and who should be asked for compensation.</p>
<p>(3) Historically, schools have charged fees once per semester, so principals can refuse parents' requests to pay in installments. If a second addition is allowed this time, will this precedent be opened, and will there be three or four additions in the future, or once or twice a month, because prices are constantly changing.</p>
<p>(4) The tuition fee can be added a second time this year. Will the tuition fee be handled as usual next year? Will parents be allowed to pay in installments in the future?</p>
<p>(5) On what kind of educational laws is the additional tuition fee based? Does the government have the right to approve this kind of forced parents to be non-obligatory and non-responsible ancestors?</p>
<p>(6) If parents cannot afford to pay due to financial difficulties, or are unwilling to pay because of the dignity of respecting the contractual behavior stipulated in the law, does the government also allow schools to expel students from school?</p>
<p>(7) Schools have a board of directors. Now that the board of directors does not bear the school's finances, what is the use of this name? It can be replaced by the general assembly of all parents. Please explain the responsibilities of the board of directors and the future handling of the board of directors.</p>
<p>(8) Schools can violate contractual behavior and add tuition fees. Can stores also force employers to increase prices for losses on orders? The government should be impartial to the people, and agriculture, industry, commerce, and academia should be treated equally. Huaisu does not sympathize with the school's collection of the second tuition fee, but she sympathizes with the poverty of the teachers. Therefore, she suggests that it is best to use the name of "Winter Relief Fund for Poor Teachers," if the teachers are unwilling to accept relief, then they might as well still take the old path of "respecting teachers," and the Education Bureau should jointly organize an expanded fundraising campaign with the City Council Education Group and the Teachers' Union. Because it is mandatory to be borne by the parents, then who will bear the burden if the parents cannot afford it? My humble opinion is like this, please ask the mayor to explain?</p>
<h3 id="e71">The Price of Rice Rationing in November Will Be Decided by a Three-Person Group Tomorrow <a href="#e71" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c71" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">71</a></h3>
<p>The distribution of household rice rationing certificates for November in this city has begun in various districts. The rice rationing has been rushed to be transported and there is sufficient preparation. It has been decided to ration it on the 5th of next month. Regarding the issue of rice rationing prices, the three-person negotiation method will still be adopted. Mayor Wu will meet with representatives of the Ministry of Food and representatives of the Shanghai Branch of the Economic Cooperation Administration tomorrow afternoon at the Municipal Government to negotiate, which can be announced immediately.

<p>It is also learned that after this city replaced the new national identity cards, there are still people who have moved their household registration and have not received them. After applying for a replacement identity card for these household registrations, they can make a supplementary application to receive rice rationing certificates.</p>

Now, in order to show concern for the difficulties of merchants, the public places with illegal buildings will be ordered to demolish or improve them immediately. It has also been decided that in the future, for public places to obtain licenses, the Bureau of Public Works must first review the construction situation to see if it meets the regulations before the Police Bureau issues a permit.</p>

<p>Regarding the issue of raw material imports under the quota system for the seventh and eighth seasons, the pharmaceutical industry previously requested an increase in the proportion to 75%.

However, those in the industry who have previously had qualified buying household qualifications can still order goods from importers, but the amount must be deducted from the industrial quota portion. It is said that the manufacturers in the industry are deeply dissatisfied with this decision and intend to appeal to the Export-Import Control Commission to redistribute it.</p>

<p>After the currency reform in August and the use of gold yuan coupons, the prices of woolen fabrics generally fell within the first week, but soon continued to rise. As a buying frenzy began, stores were emptied by狂购, and the best goods were mostly hidden. The price limit was changed to negotiated price, and then from negotiated price to free bidding, which caused the black market to become the white market. The prices of all goods soared, all based on the price of rice as the standard, and woolen fabrics also jumped up completely because of this. However, it has recently stabilized. The wholesale prices of the main woolen fabrics per yard in the market are published as follows:</p>

It is said that the wounded soldiers are in very good order. When getting on and off the plane, there are trucks from the Joint Logistics Headquarters to pick them up. From this, we can know that the government cares very much about the wounded officers and soldiers. In order to reduce the loneliness of the wounded officers and soldiers during the flight, each person is given a pack of 20 cigarettes for them to smoke during the journey to express their condolences.</p>

<p>Since the newly appointed Premier of the Executive Yuan, Sun Ke, expressed his support for opening up navigation rights on the Yangtze River to a Reuters reporter in Shanghai the other day, it has aroused firm opposition from the shipping industry in Shanghai. They stated that if the government purely intends to facilitate foreign ships in transporting relief supplies, allowing direct berthing at the three wharves of Nanjing, Jiujiang, and Hankou for unloading cargo, the shipping industry can accept this conditional opening. However, if the government disregards national sovereignty and unconditionally opens inland navigation rights across the board, the shipping industry is determined to oppose it and will protest with action if necessary. Currently, the shipping industry in Shanghai has decided to jointly submit a petition to the President and Sun Ke to oppose the opening of inland navigation rights and will convene an emergency meeting within the month to discuss countermeasures.</p>

<p>Since the implementation of temporary martial law in Shanghai, the results have been good. To ensure the security of the city's suburbs, the military, police, and gendarmerie authorities have decided to organize military, police, and gendarmerie patrols during martial law, specifically to hunt down bandits who appear unpredictably in the suburbs and to crack down on the troublemaking of scattered soldiers. In addition, to strengthen the preparedness during martial law, the Municipal Police Bureau will conduct temporary surprise inspections, jointly carried out by the detectives of various branches and the main bureau, and the "Flying Fortresses," divided into two types: general inspections and local inspections. A specific date will be selected each month for simultaneous citywide inspections in all districts. Local inspections will designate a specific area for search. However, the targets of the above surprise inspections are outdoor streets, lanes, and alleys. Private residences and factories, except for public entertainment venues, are not included in the surprise inspections.</p>

<h3 id="e96">Agricultural Reclamation Office Assists in Undertaking Drainage Projects for Two Lakes; Seventy Sets of Water Pumps Distributed to Hunan and Jiangxi Provinces <a href="#e96" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c96" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">96</a></h3>
<p>The Mechanical Agricultural Reclamation Management Office of the Post-War Relief and Rehabilitation Administration Commission has been actively promoting mechanical agricultural reclamation work. Over the past year, the office has used various water pumps and tractors transported to China through the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) to successively allocate them to agricultural groups across the country, providing farmers with significant assistance in cultivation. Recently, the office, considering that Poyang Lake in Jiangxi and Dongting Lake in Hunan are the largest lakes in the Yangtze River basin, and that the lakeside areas of both lakes are low-lying, deemed the use of water pumps essential to prevent flooding and abandonment of land. After discussions between the office and the governments of Hunan and Jiangxi provinces, it was decided that the office would supply a large number of water pumps and other machinery to assist in the drainage projects in the lakeside areas of the two provinces. According to the contract signed between the office and the two provincial governments, for the Dongting Lake lakeside drainage project in Hunan Province, twelve-inch propeller-type water pumps, along with "Chrysler" brand 60-horsepower engines and necessary accessories, a total of forty sets, will be allocated. Initially, nine sets will be allocated, and then, depending on the capacity for utilization, allocations will continue until the end of March next year. The allocation to the Jiangxi Provincial Government for the Poyang Lake lakeside drainage project will be carried out in the same manner, but the number of water pumps is stipulated to be thirty sets, with six sets allocated initially. All expenses and machinery transportation costs will be borne by the two provincial governments, while the Agricultural Reclamation Office will only be responsible for technical guidance and assistance. According to the person in charge of the office, once the above machinery is delivered and used, the water conservancy projects in the lakeside areas of Hunan and Jiangxi provinces will be greatly improved in the future. This will not only guarantee the prevention of future floods and droughts, but will also be of great benefit to farmland.</p>

As a result, President Cheng Xuke was re-elected, and the directors were also successfully elected. After the meeting, there were also entertainment programs, which were very lively.</p>
<h3 id="e98">Don't Wrong Impoverished Students with Scholarship Applications - An Enraging Incident Amidst News of School Fee Increases <a href="#e98" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c98" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">98</a></h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] The Shanghai Municipal Government has approved an increase of one to three times in tuition fees for various private primary and secondary schools in Shanghai, due to the efforts of teachers and staff. Under the "legal" increase in fees, the income of teachers and staff can be slightly supplemented, but the burden on general parents will inevitably increase as a result. Although there is no perfect solution, it is still understandable to pay more tuition fees for the sake of the livelihood of teachers and staff. However, what makes many parents and concerned people in society indignant, uneasy, and unwilling to remain silent is the "school shop" style of some schools, where they are never tired of taking from students, but are extremely stingy when giving to poor students.</p>
<p>The other day, this newspaper's social services column responded to readers again regarding scholarships. It was said that there were originally 329 applicants to this newspaper for scholarships who had passed the initial review. However, after the re-examination by the Scholarship Unified Review Committee, only 137 people passed. The remaining 192 people were rejected because the schools they attended either never submitted a list of tuition-free students, or although they had submitted a list, the number of tuition-free spots was insufficient. According to the decision of the Scholarship Unified Review Committee, students applying for scholarships from any organizations or groups must be attending a school that already has a sufficient number of tuition-free students and cannot apply for more. This is intended to prevent schools from "being generous at the expense of others." Some schools (the names of which have been disclosed) either did not submit a list or, although they submitted a list, the number of spots was insufficient, so the applications could not be approved.</p>
<p>According to regulations, every middle school should have 20% of its students on tuition-free status. However, among the aforementioned schools, there are many with a long history and excellent reputation. Why have they failed to comply with the regulations? According to reporters who visited several people in charge, some said that most of the students in the school have fairly good family circumstances, and there are not many applicants for tuition exemption. Others claimed that although there are many applicants, there are very few who meet the requirements of being both impoverished and outstanding, and therefore there are not enough tuition-free spots. The reporter then asked why there were students from the school applying for scholarships from this newspaper, and why there were applicants considered qualified by this newspaper after review. They hesitated and said that they could re-investigate these students. According to insiders, some schools simply treat the 20% regulation as a dead letter, and make things extremely difficult and picky for students applying, the real reason being nothing more than their unwillingness to reduce income.</p>
<p>On the part of the Bureau of Education, all it can do for this type of school is to issue official documents urging them to comply. However, it is heard that many schools often ignore the orders of the Bureau of Education. The Scholarship Unified Review Committee will transfer the students who were affected by the insufficient number of tuition-free spots in their schools and were unable to receive scholarships from this newspaper to the Bureau of Education to order those schools to provide them with tuition exemptions. However, it is doubtful whether the schools will comply. Moreover, how long will it take between the transfer and the order? As for the scholarships from this newspaper, the amount for each middle school student is between ten and thirty yuan, which was worth about one stone of white rice at the beginning of this semester. However, because it had to be submitted to the Unified Review Committee for re-examination, and the Unified Review Committee had to wait for each school to submit its list of tuition-free students, the process was delayed until recently before it could be issued. However, the amount of ten or twenty yuan is now only enough for travel expenses for those who live far away to collect it. The purpose of the scholarship has been completely lost, and those in charge are deeply saddened by this.</p>

<p>[Report from our newspaper] As the weather turns cold, the refugees on the streets huddle and shiver, in a very miserable state. Director Wu of the Bureau of Social Affairs yesterday made a special statement saying: The Bureau is aware that the number of refugees fleeing to Shanghai is increasing day by day, and has decided to expand winter relief efforts. New housing will be built, and management methods will be improved. Refugees from disaster areas and unemployed vagrants will be housed separately, so that refugees with self-respect who are forced by actual needs will not be afraid of being accommodated. I have already ordered the vocational training center to prepare housing that can accommodate about 800 to 1,000 people. Unemployed vagrants and street beggars sent by the police station will be accommodated in the first and second shelters in Caohejing. The newly built accommodation facilities can temporarily accommodate 1,400 refugees, targeting disaster area refugees who are in dire need of assistance. The management policy is to improve living conditions, promote health, and encourage a spirit of mutual help and encouragement, so that they can obtain a reasonably warm life in difficult circumstances. Generally, refugees who requested to live with their families last year can also have this wish fulfilled this year. As for the labor relief work in Shenjijiang, Panlongjiang, Shajing Port, and Xiaobang in western Shanghai, more than 2,000 refugees are still working. Recently, there are also plans to dredge the Suzhou Creek, as the failure to dredge the river further will affect the navigation of rice boats next year. As for porridge kitchens, preparations are underway to set up 16 of them first, which can begin operating on the 10th of next month. The six in Zhabei can supply about 30,000 people, the three in Nanshi can supply about 7,000 people, and the two in Pudong can supply about 2,000 people. The others in Wusong, Jiangwan, as well as western Shanghai and Pudong, can supply a total of about 60,000 people. Relief for the destitute and the repatriation of refugees will continue.</p>

<p>[Report from our newspaper] Yesterday's Group A football match between Qingbai and the leading team was unexpected. After scoring a goal in the first half, the leading team performed abnormally in the second half, losing five straight goals and ending the match 5-1. More than 10,000 fans attended the Yiyuan stadium yesterday, the largest turnout seen this season.</p>
<p>The first half yesterday was quite exciting. The leading team's Northeastern players performed well, and the Qingbai army was troubled and unable to make progress. Unexpectedly, the situation changed greatly in the second half, with the ball revolving around the leading team's territory. Qing Zhong successfully scored two goals, taking a 2-1 lead. Then, in the last 20 minutes, they scored three more goals, ending the match 5-1. The Qingbai forwards had some excellent performances. The leading team repeatedly failed to score in the second half, their attacks were completely blocked, and with the carelessness of the defense, they were unable to save the game. The intensity of the competition could not be represented by the score of 5-1.</p>
<p>Match Overview</p>
<p>Referee Zhang Le, linesmen Wu Shouheng and Chen Jixiang. Qingbai attacked first, and the leading team counterattacked, controlling the midfield and kicking fiercely. After a stalemate of 15 minutes, Gu Yourong was fouled by Qingbai, and a penalty kick was awarded. Jiang Xian's skillful shot failed to score, which was actually an unfavorable sign for the leading team. Five minutes later, Gu Dirong stole the ball, and Meng Yiliang slipped and fell on the spot. Huang Shijie rushed out, and Gu Yourong calmly scored, giving the leading team the first goal. The first half ended 1-0.</p>
<p>After a break, both teams returned to the field with the same lineups. Qingbai counterattacked and launched a great offensive. Within five minutes, A Fu passed to Jin Lu in the chaos, each scoring a goal and tying the score. The ball was still in Qingbai's hands. After ten minutes, Xiao Luo advanced and passed to A Fu near the goal. Seeing the critical situation, Lv Chengshi rushed out, and A Fu chipped the ball into the net. Qingbai took a 2-1 lead. The leading team counterattacked, but was blocked everywhere, and their morale gradually declined. However, the situation was still very even, and there was a possibility of a comeback. Unexpectedly, at 30 minutes, Fei Chunhua passed the ball to A Fu. Zheng Bingyi tried to block him, but A Fu dribbled past him and angled the ball into the net near the goal, making it 3-1. Qingbai came back strong, and Xue Peiran passed to Xiao Luo, who cut through three defenders and swept the ball into the net, making it 4-1. The leading team's situation was dire. Before the end of the match, Xiao Luo scored another low shot, and Yan Chengkuan was unable to save it, ending the match 5-1.</p>

<h3 id="e108">First Round of the Xuzhou Campaign (Part 1) <a href="#e108" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c108" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">108</a></h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent Ling Songshou</p>
<p>[Taibo Bengbu 25th Rapid Dispatch] The initial victory of the Xuzhou Campaign will be declared to the world: Victory will forever belong to righteousness. Before the campaign broke out, the National Army had already voluntarily abandoned Ye Zheng, Bian, Shangqiu, and Donghai, Lianyungang, and other places, concentrating its forces on the periphery of Xuzhou. At that time, facing Xuzhou directly was the Li Mi Army Corps, to the west of Xuzhou was the Qiu Qingquan Army Corps, and to the east of Xuzhou was the Huang Baitao Army Corps. These three major army corps, in the past two years of suppressing the rebellion, fought in Shandong, Jiangsu, Anhui, Henan, and other places, and were all iron troops that were victorious in every battle. In addition, the Battle of Xuzhou was not only to defend Xuzhou, nor only to defend the capital, but to defend the independence, democracy, and freedom of our Chinese nation. The stakes were high, so the National Army in this war was "an army of grief." Every soldier understood how sacred and important a mission they were carrying on their shoulders today, and they were all willing to fight to the death against the communist bandits for the sake of the country and the nation, just as General Liu Jingfu, commander-in-chief of the Xuzhou Anti-Bandit Headquarters, said: "We have the belief that we will win, and the determination to die." Therefore, in essence, the National Army already possessed the foundation for victory.</p>
<p>How the Communist Bandits Invaded</p>
<p>The deployment of the communist bandits was as follows: Liu Bocheng's First, Third, Ninth, and Eleventh Columns, Chen Geng's Fourth and Ninth Columns, and Chen Yi's Third, Eighth, and Liangguang Columns, for a total of four, two, and three columns respectively, launched a containment attack on the Qiu Qingquan Army Corps on the west side of Xuzhou; Chen Yi's First, Fourth, Sixth, Seventh, New Eighth, and Tenth Columns, for a total of six columns, attacked the front of Xuzhou to contain the Li Mi Army Corps; and Chen Yi's Second, New Seventh, New Ninth, Ninth, Eleventh, Twelfth, and Thirteenth Columns, for a total of seven columns, launched a main force attack on the Huang Baitao Army Corps on the east side of Xuzhou.</p>
<p>The battle officially began on November 8. On the morning of that day, the communist bandits attacked Hanzhuang with the Seventh and New Eighth Columns. The National Army, for strategic reasons, annihilated a part of the main force of the invading communist bandits and then withdrew from the defense. That night, the communist bandits on the east and west sides of Xuzhou began to attack the two flanks of the National Army again.</p>
<p>Good News from the East and West Wings</p>
<p>On the western flank, the communist bandits used Chen Geng's Fourth and Ninth Columns, and a part of Chen Yi's Third, Eighth, and Liangguang Columns, encountering the "Fire Bull Army" Qiu Qingquan Army Corps, which dominated eastern Henan. How could they let go? In the Battle of Huangkou, the bandits suffered more than 10,000 casualties, and the National Army first reported good news.</p>
<p>On the eastern flank, the Huang Army Corps used the Grand Canal as a barrier and met the incoming Chen bandit Second, New Seventh, Eleventh, Twelfth, and Thirteenth Columns head-on, inflicting heavy damage on the bandits in the Yunhezhan and Yaowan areas.</p>
<p>Huang Army Corps Fights Hard Battles</p>
<p>The original position of the Huang Army Corps was the area on both sides of the Longhai Railway from Daxujia, east of Xuzhou, to Yunhezhan. Starting on the 9th, the bandit First, Fourth, Sixth, Seventh, New Eighth, and Tenth Columns, which were originally on the Hanzhuang, Taierzhuang line, rushed south, first cutting off the connection between the Huang Army Corps and Xuzhou. At this time, the bandit Second, Eleventh, and Twelfth Columns on the eastern front circled to the south of Nianzhuang, the main position of the Huang Army Corps, and a siege situation was formed on the 10th. The Huang Army Corps then shortened its position, with Nianzhuang as the core, and launched a fierce battle against the communist bandits, who outnumbered them several times.</p>
<p>General Huang Baitao has been fighting in the battlefields of southern Shandong, northern Jiangsu, and eastern Henan for many years and is known for his stability and toughness. He naturally would not miss this best opportunity to annihilate the main force of the bandit army. Thus, good news was reported again on the 12th. The Huang Army Corps, in coordination with the air force, defeated the offensive of more than 160,000 bandits from nine columns on the eastern front, and the bandit army suffered more than 37,000 casualties.</p>
<p>Qiu Army Corps Counter-Surrounds</p>
<p>The communist bandits' intention to "eat up" the Huang Army Corps was already obvious. Therefore, the authorities again ordered the Qiu Qingquan Army Corps, which was originally on the western wing, to advance eastward and deploy a counter-encirclement posture against the bandits on the eastern front. At this time, the remnants of the Liu and Chen departments, which had been hit hard on the western front, still attempted to attack the eastern front and prevent the eastward advance of the Qiu Army Corps. Thus, on the 13th, they were divided into three routes, detouring and fleeing south between the Xiaoxian and Yongcheng areas, spying on the southern side of Xuzhou and the Su County. The Xuzhou side had anticipated this move by the communist bandits and immediately transferred the Sun Yuanliang Army Corps, which was sweeping the Wo Meng area, north to defend Xuzhou. Although the Su County county seat fell on the night of the 15th under the desperate defense of the garrison police and the general team, it had no impact on the Xuzhou battle situation at that time.</p>
<p>Liu Bandit's southward advance could not stop the actions of the Qiu Army Corps. The Qiu Army Corps advanced along the south side of the Longhai Road on the 13th. Our armored vehicle groups, under the command of Colonel Jiang Weiguo, also cooperated with the Qiu Army Corps to attack the Chen bandit First, Fourth, Seventh, and Tenth Columns, which were stubbornly resisting on the south side. At 10:00 AM on the 16th, the Qiu Army Corps, in coordination with the air force and tanks, annihilated more than 20,000 communist bandits along the way and joined forces with the Huang Army Corps, which had been besieged for six days and nights. During the period when the Qiu Army Corps advanced eastward, the Huang Army Corps continued to eliminate more than 10,000 of the bandit's main force. The good news from the Xuzhou Anti-Bandit Headquarters spread throughout the country that day, and those who were concerned about the battle situation smiled for this victory.</p>
<p>Three Major Army Corps Join Forces</p>
<p>Qiu and Huang joined forces, and the two major army corps, in cooperation with Li Mi's forces, pursued and suppressed the bandits separately. The communist bandits seemed to feel that this disastrous defeat was not enough. Starting on the 17th, they urgently regrouped their remnants and launched a fierce attack on the eastern front, and Chen Yi's Second, Fourth, and Twelfth Columns, in cooperation with Liu Bocheng's forces, which were originally on the southern side of Xuzhou, attempted to attack the southeastern side of Xuzhou. In the days before this time, the Sun Yuanliang Army Corps on the southern side of Xuzhou had already annihilated more than 5,000 of the Liu and Chen departments who had come to their deaths.</p>
<p>Since the communist army was unwilling to admit defeat and returned to the battlefield to fight like trapped beasts, it was exactly what the National Army wanted. Therefore, the Qiu Army Corps returned to encircle and suppress them. From the evening of the 17th to dawn on the 18th, in one night, the sparks of our National Army's guns and cannons and the roar of the divine eagles annihilated more than 20,000 communist bandits in the main battlefield of Pantang Town, more than 20 li southeast of Xuzhou. More than 8,000 kind compatriots, who had already realized the truth and had been driven by the communist bandits to fight, surrendered to the National Army one after another. This was the "Victory of Southern Xuzhou." The Qiu Army Corps, in conjunction with the Sun Army Corps, took advantage of the victory to suppress the south, arriving south of Sanbao on the 19th and continuing to reap fruitful results.</p>
<p>Repeatedly Defending Nianzhuang</p>
<p>The day the Qiu Army Corps returned was the time when the Huang Army Corps on the eastern front was fighting hard to continue attracting the main force of the bandits and defending Nianzhuang alone. The Li Mi Army Corps, which advanced eastward from Xuzhou, was met with stubborn resistance from the communist bandits along the way. Although the gains were abundant, the speed of advance was inevitably discounted. Until the 22nd, the Li Army Corps was still more than 30 li away from Nianzhuang. On the 21st, the Huang Army Corps, which had been defending Nianzhuang for twelve days and nights, was subjected to intensive fire from the communist bandits. In terms of shells alone, the Nianzhuang position received more than 10,000 rounds. The stronghold fortifications had been completely destroyed and were unusable. The Huang Army Corps transferred to a certain block of positions northeast of Nianzhuang and continued to fight hard.</p>
<p>Gains Exceed Losses</p>
<p>The Xuzhou Campaign is different from previous major battles. This campaign is a decisive battle in which both the bandits and our side use their main forces south of the Yellow River. Therefore, in this campaign, the gain or loss of a village or town is not of great importance to the overall situation. Taking the Huang Army Corps as an example, under the siege of forces several times greater than ours, it defended a lonely point for more than ten days and nights, and killed more than 100,000 bandits. This is a brilliant record that is only seen in the process of suppressing bandits. As long as the Huang Army Corps is on the eastern front for one day, it will attract the main force of the communist bandits, allowing the Li, Qiu, and Sun Army Corps near Xuzhou to calmly solve the main force of the bandits. As long as the Huang Army Corps is on the eastern front for one day, the communist bandits will not be able to escape outside the main battlefield, but will sit and wait for our various armies to deploy encirclements and annihilate them in one fell swoop. Therefore, even if Huang Fengyou suffered considerable losses on the night of the 13th, these losses are insignificant compared to the results currently achieved by the National Army. The main thing is that these minor losses will lay the foundation for the National Army to achieve greater victories in the next stage of the Xuzhou Campaign.</p>
<p>Communist Bandits Suffer 200,000 Casualties</p>
<p>Speaking of the entire development process of the battle situation, we can regard the "Great Victory of Southern Xuzhou" as the end of the initial battles of the Xuzhou Campaign. In this stage, there is no doubt that victory belongs to the National Army. In the communist bandits' broadcast on the 14th, they themselves admitted to more than 60,000 casualties. In the broadcast on the 16th, they themselves admitted to 100,000 casualties. Adding the communist bandits' casualties in the two subsequent battles of eastern and southern Xuzhou, and the difference between what they may have discounted in their own broadcasts, we estimate that the communist bandits suffered 200,000 casualties, which is by no means an exaggeration. Even if the strength of the communist bandits south of the Yellow River is greater, it will never exceed 600,000. Now, one-third of it has been lost. Judging from the results of the initial stage of the campaign, we dare to assert that the communist bandits in central China will not be able to achieve anything more in the future, especially since the environment in the second stage of the campaign is more favorable to the National Army.</p>

<p>[This Newspaper Zhenjiang 26th Dispatch] At 8 PM on the 24th, a scandalous tragedy occurred here. A military officer from a certain unit lived with his concubine at No. 155 Zhongzheng Road. The concubine was usually restless. On the evening of the 24th, the military officer returned and heard a man's voice in the room. He lifted the curtain and entered. At that time, there was a power outage, and in the darkness, he saw a man and his concubine sitting side by side on the bed, talking intimately. When the concubine saw the military officer enter the room, she got up and hugged the military officer, allowing the man to jump out of the window and escape. The military officer was furious and fired a shot, killing the concubine immediately. After the tragedy occurred, the military officer went to the Second Branch Bureau to surrender himself. On the 25th, he was transferred to the District Prosecutor's Office for interrogation.</p>

<p>Since the Central Bank and designated banks in the seven major cities of Shanghai, Nanjing, Wuhan, Chongqing, Guangzhou, Peiping, and Tianjin began handling deposit exchanges for gold and silver coins on the 22nd of this month, those applying for deposit exchanges have been extremely crowded, and long queues have reappeared in front of the banks handling the exchanges.</p>
<p>The Central Mint has been ordered to step up the casting of various gold bars in recent days. The daily melting volume has now been expanded to 10,000 bars. After the completion, the factory has been continuously transporting them to the Central Bank and airlifting them to various places for reserve.</p>
<p>In addition to the above seven major cities, the authorities have decided to expand the exchange area. The central banks in 19 cities including Hangzhou, Anqing, Chengdu, Guiyang, Kunming, Guilin, Changsha, Fuzhou, Shantou, Xi'an, Lanzhou, Qingdao, Nanchang, Dihua, Yaan, Ningxia, Wuhu, etc., will also begin handling deposit exchanges the day after tomorrow (December 1). The Central Bank has airlifted huge amounts of gold bars to the above-mentioned places separately. All will implement the exchange on schedule from that day.</p>
<p>According to financial officials: The government controls a huge amount of gold and silver. In addition to the huge amount of gold and silver recovered last time, the gold part also has a large number of gold bricks purchased from the United States for long-term exchange and application. The silver yuan part, the amount of silver and silver coins previously stored, is also huge. Therefore, various places will handle exchanges on a long-term and unlimited basis to strengthen the recovery of gold yuan coupons and tighten the currency.</p>

<p>The authorities will announce it in the short term</p>
<p>The short-term treasury bills issued by the Central Bank have recently had poor sales results due to the high black market interest rates, which are quite different from the interest rates on the treasury bills. According to related sources, the authorities are now properly formulating improvement measures to strengthen the sales force of the treasury bills. Concrete measures can be announced in the short term.</p>

<p>In the past week, the market price of cigarettes has been sluggish and has shown a downward trend. The rapid decline in its trend is beyond the expectations of the general industry.</p>
<p>According to observations by people in the industry, there are two main reasons: (1) Due to the wait-and-see attitude of large households and massive dumping. (2) After the last sharp increase in cigarette prices, general purchasing power has been greatly reduced. The sales volume in this city is limited, and various cigarette factories have resumed dispatching goods one after another, resulting in a more abundant inventory on the market. In addition, factors such as the tight money supply in the market, the lack of cash, and the unusually high black market interest rates have caused the cigarette market to be depressed. Without special circumstances, it is difficult to expect a turnaround in the short term.</p>

<p>As winter approaches, the amount of coal consumed in this city has increased sharply. The amount of coal used by various power companies in this city has also increased sharply due to the increasing consumption of electric heating recently. However, the amount of coal shipped south from the north has been decreasing day by day due to the impact of the war. The winter coal use in this city is quite worrying.</p>
<p>The National Coal Mine Merchants Joint Operation Office of this city yesterday added seven more ships to transport coal from a certain port in Taiwan to Shanghai. Among them, the "Luanzhou" and "Fufu" ships have loaded more than 13,000 tons of coal and have set sail from Keelung Port, which will be transported to Shanghai within about a week.</p>

<p>[Mr. Xue Zhenwen asks] (1) I rented a front building last year, and the monthly rent is three dou of medium-grade rice. I pay the monthly rent in advance on the first day of each month, according to the market price published in the daily newspaper. However, the landlord suddenly claims that I must supplement it according to the market price in the evening newspaper. The two sides insist on their own opinions. I don't know how to solve it. (2) There is a loft in my residence, which was built a year ago. Because of shoddy workmanship and material reduction at that time, the beams shake when I move, which is extremely dangerous. I have repeatedly notified them to add materials, but they ignore it. In case of misfortune, my life is in danger. How should I deal with it?</p>
<p>[Lawyer Chuan Kuangling answers] (1) Since the two parties have agreed to pay the monthly rent based on the rice value, they should follow their agreement. However, the rice value for converting rent varies. You can calculate and pay according to the government-stipulated rationed rice price. If it is still not harmonious, you can sue the court for a fair ruling. (2) You can refer to the provisions of Article 429 and Article 430 of the Civil Code.</p>

<h3 id="e121">Interpretation of "Official" <a href="#e121" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c121" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">121</a></h3>
<p>— Lei Ting</p>
<p>In our country, officials have always been high above. And among the four classes of people, the closest to officials are scholars. "He who excels in learning can become an official" is the most obvious annotation. The Rites of Zhou says: "Establish officials and divide duties," then the establishment of officials should be to guard their respective duties and govern the country. Also: "Discuss and decide, then appoint them as officials." The so-called "discussion" is of course the court's evaluation and general public opinion; this on the one hand shows that the appointment of officials must be cautious, and on the other hand also shows that officials should have their reputation and ambitions. After the Republic of China, the name of officials has changed to public servants, without the dignity of "sir" and "master" in the autocratic era, and is civilianized. But because they still manage the affairs of the public and have power, the name has changed but the reality remains, and they are still high above.</p>
<p>Accordingly, the so-called officials, whether in the autocratic era or the democratic era, are dignified, at least in China, in today's China, it is still so. The so-called public servant is only convenient for making a comparison with democracy. If someone considers themselves the master and treats officials as "servants," then it is far from the truth.</p>
<p>Therefore, my first view of officials is:</p>
<p>This is the first interpretation.</p>
<p>But the principle of "he who excels in learning can become an official" has not changed. What is different is that in the autocratic era, imperial examination graduates were the stepping stone to becoming officials, but now they have been replaced by doctors or masters. In the past, it was an honor to be a student of the emperor, but now it is fashionable to be a gilded doctor; the names are different, but the reality is somewhat similar (like an American tailor who becomes president, there is no precedent in our country). As for the recently added social elites, they are slightly equivalent to the former recluse scholars, which is only a rare opportunity. So the most important thing is still learning. But the so-called learning is not necessarily the "learning" of classics and arguments, the talent to govern the world cannot be seen in books alone.</p>
<p>So my second view of officials is:</p>
<p>Academic qualifications plus reputation. If they can also add elegance, it would be even better.</p>
<p>This is the second interpretation.</p>
<p>The above is the essence of officials, or to put it bluntly, the capital of officials. The greater the capital, the higher the position one can climb, which is an immutable truth.</p>
<p>But relying on capital alone is still not enough. Because this is just a stepping stone. Once the door is opened, the stone is useless. For example, people who went from scholar to official in the past did become officials, but some ended up ruined and discredited, some remained honest and poor, and some never climbed up. So the reason for this is the lack of skill. Therefore, the most important method for being an official is skill.</p>
<p>Speaking of skill, it is truly ever-changing, mysterious and infinite. But to put it concisely, it is nothing more than eight words: "Adapt to the times, respond to circumstances." For example, one should be serious when it is appropriate to be serious, and one should be gentle when it is appropriate to be gentle; the first sentence is based on the law, and the second sentence may as well be based on human feelings. "Deep sympathy" is a generous gesture that costs nothing, the more the better; "Should be without discussion" is a righteous and stern idiom, why not use it—the more methods the better, it is permissible to use words instead of actions, because the Chinese people are the most forgetful nation; one must have the courage to deny what one said today, and one must have the ability to overturn the order issued in the morning in the afternoon. In short, if the target is a sheep, one should appear as a tiger; if the target is a tiger, one may as well temporarily stoop to be a sheep. Using the immutable to respond to the ever-changing is our political policy, and changing faces billions of times is the method of being an official for our public servants today. Therefore, my third view of officials is:</p>
<p>Ever-changing, one should have the abilities of the Great Sage Equal to Heaven.</p>
<p>This is the third interpretation.</p>
<p>Writing here, I suddenly thought of the two sentences in the first paragraph, "govern the country" and "discuss and decide, then appoint them as officials." How should they be explained?</p>
<p>This thought made me dazed. However, I may as well say this: "Discussion" is the judgment of the superior, and "decision" is the decision of the superior. Once the judgment and decision of the superior are made, the judged and decided wear the uniform of a public servant and take office.</p>
<p>Then what about "govern the country"? This is really impossible to answer. Fortunately, a flash of inspiration came, and I brazenly replied: "Originally, I had already forgotten it, so I might as well forget it completely, fortunately, most of our public servants, most of them seem to have forgotten it long ago."</p>

<p>— Wu Yong</p>
<p>To seek the governance of the country, it is most important to cultivate a good social atmosphere. "Those above have what they like, those below will inevitably have more," this means that the atmosphere must be cultivated from top to bottom. This is one saying. In a democratic country, however, if the people have what they like, those above must inevitably do so, which is from bottom to top. From bottom to top is also a good atmosphere in itself.</p>
<p>People only advocate the theory of mutual assistance when they need help from others.</p>
<p>Telling people not to steal oil is set up by those who fear that their oil will be stolen.</p>
<p>"Obedience" is a word from superiors to subordinates, which is also one-sided</p>
<p>Whether it is people or things, being too good will become not good; conversely, as long as it is kept within limits, the bad will not become truly bad. As long as you adhere to the doctrine of the mean, even "doing everything" is not impossible</p>
<p>There are hateful hypocrites and lovable true villains in the world.</p>
<h3 id="e123">Selling Books <a href="#e123" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c123" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">123</a></h3>
<p>— You Mojun</p>
<p>When I count on my fingers, it's been more than forty years since I started making a living inhaling chalk dust. For half my life, I haven't liked anything else, only books. I'd rather wear shabby clothes and eat poorly, but I can't help but buy books. Because of this, in my humble abode, the simple room, on the table, on the shelves, even in the kerosene boxes and broken leather trunks, are all filled with books. Only I know where a certain book is, which book is under which book. My family never dares to move them recklessly; therefore, although this simple room doesn't have a fierce tiger sign hanging high that reads "No Entry for Outsiders," it seems to have become my forbidden territory.</p>
<p>In recent years, I don't know why, but I always feel that being a poor teacher doesn't amount to much, so I vowed never to buy books again. In the past, I liked to run to new and used bookstores, take out my wallet and exchange it for one or two books, carry them home, and treasure them like precious jewels. Now, I simply don't dare to even glance at the new book advertisements published in the daily newspapers by major bookstores, because every time I touch my wallet, "it's empty, I have exhausted both ends by tapping on it!" There is no shortage of books I love to read in the school library, but these books can only be treated as honored guests, and I don't dare keep them for many days.</p>
<p>My old wife has repeatedly advised me that since our descendants are not scholars, what use are these books? Why not sort them out yourself: keep what can be kept, and sell what cannot be kept, or even sell them by the pound. What she says is not without merit. But I'm so busy running around for food and clothing, where do I have the time to sort them out? Even if I had the time, tell me, like a book of poetic rhymes, I bought it when I was thirteen or fourteen years old when I was learning to write five-character eight-line examination papers. Now I don't need it to guide me, but out of old affection, how can I bear to part with it and sell it by the pound, so that it can be used as recycled paper, or even appear on a pancake stall!</p>
<p>Recently, my younger brother Zhi Ren also had the idea of selling books. His reason is that there's no use keeping them, and selling them now can still be used for other purposes. He advised me that since I'm not studying national history, a set of the Twenty-Five Histories published by Kaiming Press can really be exchanged for some fish and meat to eat. What he says is absolutely right. However, this time when I returned home, I saw that the set of Twenty-Five Histories was still holding its ground, maintaining its consistent motionless posture, standing in that broken bookcase, fulfilling its duty of guarding. I could only glance at it, sigh, and leave!</p>
<p>My humble abode originally had many years' worth of this newspaper, bound into volumes. Probably because my family saw that I was useless, they took advantage of my being in Shanghai and sold them by the pound in a rough manner to exchange for rice. I thought to myself: unless they are willing to take drastic measures, I am determined not to think about buying books again.</p>
<h3 id="e124">Eastern Scales and Western Claws <a href="#e124" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c124" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">124</a></h3>
<p>— Xian Si</p>
<p>Recently, Johns Hopkins University in the United States suddenly announced that it would buy fireflies in large quantities. Regardless of whether they are dead or alive, the price for every hundred fireflies is 25 cents (US), which suddenly made all the children in the city very busy. According to the university, the light at the tail of the firefly may contain vitamin K.</p>
<p>Although the Second World War ended three years ago, the naval mines drifting in the ocean have not yet been completely cleared. Since the armistice, 250 ships from various countries around the world have been endangered by them, of which 116 have been sunk or severely damaged beyond repair.</p>
<h3 id="e125">"My Family" <a href="#e125" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c125" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">125</a></h3>
<p>— Xi Hou</p>
<p>In the past, people often boasted about the outstanding figures in their family with a tone of admiration, such as: "This is my family's thousand-mile colt!" "My family's yellow-bearded boy!" They sounded very intimate and touching. Later generations, whether because they couldn't squeeze out any talent or because they particularly respected their ancestors, always traced back ten or dozens of generations, picking out a suitable figure or two. For example, those surnamed Tao would talk about "My family's Yuanming," and those surnamed Li would mention "My family's Taibai," with a smug look on their faces, as if they possessed the legacy of Yuanming and Taibai.</p>
<p>Sometimes this scope is further expanded to "My family's Taizhen" and "My family's Xiaoxiao," which feels even more romantic and unrestrained. However, women themselves rarely mention "My family's Daoyun" or "My family's Yi'an." This is naturally due to the male-centered society, where women themselves take their husband's surname and cannot speak out. This clever trick can only be occupied by men.</p>
<p>Even now, the clamor of "My family this and that" is still endless. The speaker may be unintentional, but the listener finds it disgusting. It doesn't stop there. Even a lake or a mountain, if it is related to the surname of a predecessor, descendants will come forward to claim it. Not long ago, I even saw a descendant of a "poor village chief" (?), who, when mentioning Tianping Mountain in Suzhou, actually said it was "My family's Tianping." This is because Tianping is also known as "Fan Grave Mountain." As times progress, there will eventually be a day when someone boasts: "Look at the world today, it is all my family's domain!"</p>
<h3 id="e126">Never Let Go Even in Death <a href="#e126" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c126" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">126</a></h3>
<p>— Nan Wu</p>
<p>There are many stubborn people who become more and more prejudiced as they get older, so that they even tightly control their descendants in their wills, requiring those heirs to fulfill certain conditions before they can receive the inheritance. Their conditions are sometimes simply absurd and ridiculous, almost like a joke, but at least in the United States, these conditions have legal value.</p>
<p>One old maid hated more than anything the way young girls dressed up in fancy clothes. Therefore, in her will, she said that she was willing to pass all her property to her great-niece, but on one condition: that the great-niece not use any makeup within six months of her death. The young girl followed the will and successfully inherited the estate.</p>
<p>Isabella, the daughter of Isaac Merritt Singer, the inventor of the Singer sewing machine, was a nun. Her father's will stipulated that his inheritance of $1.3 million be passed on to her, but only on the condition that she first "return to secular life." But Isabella remained a nun as before.</p>
<p>One person's will stipulated that the large-scale insurance company he ran be inherited by his younger brother, but there was also a strange condition – the female employees employed in the store must all weigh more than 140 pounds. His younger brother happily complied.</p>
<p>The strangest thing is that one person promised on his deathbed to give all his money to his wife, but on one condition: that she must remarry within five years of his death. His will explained that he wanted to let others know how difficult it was to get along with her.</p>

<p>Now gold is allowed to be held. Before the ban was lifted, the North also vigorously promoted the inspection of private hoards and rewarded informers several times. The inspection was initiated by the government. Just send more police officers to "raid" gold and silver shops. As for the hoarding of ordinary people, in densely populated cities, it is really impossible to investigate. It can only rely on private informants. The article rewarding informers stated: If a private hoard is found, a certain amount can be given to the informer. The article restricting informants stated: The real name and address must be provided to prevent malicious accusations. It was thought that this was a thorough method. Whether it is thorough or not, let's not discuss it for now, but a comedy (or tragedy) of informing that occurred in Tianjin is worth discussing.</p>
<p>After a long delay, a case of informing about gold hoarding finally occurred. Indeed, 23 taels of gold were found. Indeed, the informer's real name and address were clear, without any ambiguity. It turned out to be a woman, and the accused was her husband. And the reason for informing was that the husband had an affair and used the gold to subsidize his lover, which aroused her anger, and she decided to fight to the end! Since the motive was like this, of course there was no need to remain anonymous, and the family dispute was presented frankly and completely, as if a scene from "Two Beauties Fighting for a Husband" (also known as "Double Rocking Society") was being staged, or as if Chong Gongdao in the play "The Female Escort" said about Su San and Pi Shi: "The vinegar sea is stirring up waves!" This is indeed a "tragic comedy," but such a theatrical scene actually occurred in the midst of the vigorously promoted "economic reform"! We have no time to be sad or happy about this family's scandal.</p>
<p>It must be known that the act of "informing" has a great relationship with people's hearts, customs, and social order. In the past, the government was extremely cautious about this and prevented abuses, never using it lightly, fearing that accomplices would use it for private gain and hinder the political system. As for the people, if it is not their business, they are not willing to get involved. Even if they get a reward, it is like "grabbing mutton and getting a bad smell all over your body." The criticism of the public and the anxiety of future troubles outweigh the gains. This is easy to understand. Therefore, if there is really an act of informing, it must be private anger, and not ordinary anger, but anger that "burns in the fire and fights to the end!" In this case, of course, one is not afraid to come forward with one's name. What is embarrassing is the government's side. If it is not dealt with, its own decrees cannot be justified. If it is dealt with, it is obviously helping someone eliminate jealousy, which does not seem like official business.</p>
<p>In the past imperial era, informing was only allowed for treason. Many literary inquisitions in the early Qing Dynasty arose from this. This was the emperor's selfishness, coupled with racial prejudice, fearing that someone would miss the previous Ming Dynasty and plot rebellion. As for ordinary political affairs, government offices could report cases of harboring thieves and smuggling, but there was no so-called "informing." (For secret societies that attempt to rebel, there is the term "informing," which is still a rebellious case in nature.) In the private sector, only scoundrels who harbor private anger or hope to gain honor by betraying friends are willing to come forward. Even if they receive a reward, they will be regarded as "terrifying objects" in society and villages and will be rejected by the public. In short, the term "informing" is definitely not a common practice on the political track, (1) harming the political system, (2) damaging customs, and (3) losing people's hearts.</p>
<p>Therefore, the Tianjin case is not worth laughing at if it is just a family matter. But as a natural satire of the government's reward for informing, it is very interesting.</p>

<p>— Yao Yuanzhu</p>
<p>The scenery of rivers and mountains and wine parties have all ended; for forty years, all I can do is laugh. I only worry about the changes in the world since the fall of the Jin Dynasty; how can I discuss talent in a desperate situation? The tip of the spear points to the rice morning after morning, suppressing the town. Deep down, I know the zither is everywhere. Thank you, my two or three friends of Longquan, relying on your teeth and cheeks, you burst forth with wind and thunder.</p>
<p>The bearded Shi talks about rare treasures with a stuttering mouth. Clouds under the sun are asked about, and both are unparalleled. It is difficult to accept your hand in my dreams of the two lakes; I am intoxicated with the wine of Yue, which can be compared to a person. I have abandoned learning all my life, not without friends; in this world, I have not allowed anyone like you to be my neighbor! I further ask about the surviving manuscripts at Maoling, at once raising my head to gaze toward the west of Qin. (The letter inquired about Wang Liuyi's surviving manuscripts)</p>
