<h3 id="c1">國大決定仿晨復會進行第三次票選副總統孫科程潛兩氏表示應選 <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿七日電〕休會三日之國大，定二十八日晨九時復會，進行副統選舉第三次投票，二十七日下午四時主席　開會，經二小時半之討論，已確定此項議程。二十八日上午會場秩序何維持，俾大會能順利進行，主席團會中亦曾作據密研討，咸認為任何方面刺戟性之宣傳品供不宜在會塲中散發，並盼主席團中與各助選團有關人士能勸請各助選團注意。二十八日上午大會推定胡適任主席，三副總統候選人聲明放棄候選資格事，主席團代表于斌，胡適，陳啓天，曾寶蓀，孫亞夫五人勸慰後，三氏均已表示不再堅　放棄，主席團原無接受放棄資格之權，現三氏既不堅持此事，當不必再提大會討論，惟休會兩日原因及經過，應向大會說明，當經推定于武於二十八日晨向大會報告，然後　總進行第三次投票，至選舉之投票問票監察員，上次已抽定一一八人，二十八日仍請彼請彼等繼担任。</p>
<p>〔本報南京廿七日電〕國大主席團已決定二十八日上午大會舉行副總統選舉第三次投票，惟有一部代表已擬就臨時動議一件，請主席團以有效辦法制止會塲操縱把持威脅選舉，將於二十八日上午大會中提出，並臨時動議請蔣主席蒞會，向大會報告此次副總統選舉決自由競選，黨員投票絕對自由，預計二十八日上午大會選舉投票前，恐尚有一番激辯。</p>
<p>〔本報南京廿七日電〕副總統選舉僵局打開後，各助選團之競選活動，廿六·廿七兩日又至白熱化之程度。李·孫·程三氏，均於廿七日晚對各該助選團發表演說，說明其本人放棄競選及繼續競選之動機與原因，並勉各助選團繼續努力發展。李宗仁助選團於廿七日晚八時在安樂應集會，到代表數百人，李氏以興奮愉快而堅定之口吻，發表演說，對各代表之熱烈擁護，表示無限感慰，謂此亦為督促我繼續參加競選的力量，增加無限勇氣，現在中國人民痛苦，匪亂未平，余決為民主努力，繼續奮鬥。孫科助選委會集會時，亦到代表數百人，孫氏以輕鬆之態度，發表演說，謂其本人現係應選，而非競選，應戰而非求戰，故決不作勉強之活動，而僅憑各代表授其神聖自由，本於良知之一票，至助選團之活動，係助選團本身之事，余則不擬渦問，惟孫氏對於外傳現已有協商方案之說，表示並無其事。程潛助選團數百人在中央飯店集會時，程氏以誠懇之態度發言，反復說明渠熱誠希望大會能順利完成，副總統早日選出，俾大會早日圓滿閉幕。程氏表示，渠應選而不競選，對於個人之得失，決郝爲次要，對助選團之熱烈擁護，則表示無任感動，故仍繼續應選。</p>
<h3 id="c2">三副總統候選人獲協議說係謠傳孫科盼各代表勿爲所惑 <a href="#c2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>〔中央社南京廿七日電〕孫科夫細廿七日晚六時蒞臨龍門酒家渠之助選團辦事處，並對在塲之國大代表講話，要點有三：（一）渠個人過去對副總統競選活動曾有所努力，但經近一二日之變化後，情形已全然不同，渠本已聲明放棄競選，惟因國民黨中常會及國大主席團推派各先生前來勸勉勿放槳，刻已決定聽從大會決定，仍繼續競選，以完成國大副總統之選舉程序，但今後個人對競選將不作任何活動，僅為「應選」而已。（二）近日外間謠傳甚多，其中有謂三副總統候選人經協商並獲結果，某某即將被推選為副總統，某為行政院長，而某即任立法院長，此事絕對不確。蓋渠本人即為副總統競選候選人之一，而從未參與其他候選人之任何協商，况副總統為大會全體代表所選舉，行政院長為將來總統所提名，經立法院同意後，始能確定。立法院長必須由全體立法委　所選舉者。（三）渠對各代表以前請予渠最大協助與支持，表示感　，希望各代表自由選擇能為人民服務，對建國戡亂有貢獻者，予以支持擁護，當其投神聖及良知之一票時，幸勿為謠言所惑。</p>
<p>〔又電〕程潛助選會發言人廿七日發表談話稱：（一）程氏之放棄競選，目的在為使大會順利完成，如因放棄競選而致影響大會，則週與其初衷相反，故此一問題　氏自願聽從大會之決定，然程氏亦僅應選而不競選，換言之，不作任何爭取他人選票之活動。（二）在自由競選之原則決定後，本會切望此一原則能確切保持，使每一投票人獲得免於利誘威脅之目由，且不受任何其他不正當之妨害。（三）程氏深信今日必須實行全面改革，始能挽救危機，完成戡亂，而引用賢能，又為實行改革之前提，如渠幸能當選，當以總統老友及舊部之地位，促其實現，如競選失敗，亦將以平民之資格為革新政治而奮鬥。蓋渠早屆退役之年，因主席命其延長至今年六月，延長期滿後，渠始便於從事一般政治及社會運動。</p>
<h3 id="c3">對選舉副總統林紫貴提建議 <a href="#c3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿七日電〕國大代表林紫貴，以副總統選舉發生波折，廿七日特提出三項主張，供大會參考，現已有百餘代表贊同。其主張為：（一）副總統候選人之放棄聲明書，應即退回，繼續進行選舉。（二）選舉前請蔣主席蒞會宣示國民黨中央迭次保證自由競選之決定，幷請各候選人在國父遺像前宣誓，不論競選成敗，誓必精誠團結，輔弼元首，效忠戡亂建國大業。（三）為消除誤會，各助選團應自行停止一切活動，其因擁戴而組織之憲政團體，似亦宜宣告中止。</p>
<h3 id="c4">孫李分訪程潛程亦先後答拜 <a href="#c4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿七日電〕李宗仁，孫科，程潛均表示不再堅持放棄競選後，廿七日三候選入接觸頻繁，下午孫科，李宗仁分訪程潛，程亦於李·孫來訪後，即分至李·孫處答拜。又孫科廿七下午曾訪吳鐵城，龍雲等。黃紹紘亦於廿七下午訪吳鐵城。</p>
<h3 id="c5">胡適談選舉 <a href="#c5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>盼候選人及助選人信賴秘密投票制度</p>
<p>〔中央社南京廿七日電〕記者頃叩詢胡適博士關於副總統選舉的見解。胡氏答稱：「許多糾紛的發生，每由對於無記名投票制度缺乏充分信心。我看了頭兩次副總統選舉印象極好，第一次投票時，我還担任監察職務，得到切近觀察的機會。我看見秩序良好，且絕無弊病，整個過程對於參與的同人實具有教育的價值。吾人於此應得強烈信念，認淸秘密投票可以充分保障選舉的公平，任何外來壓力或為賄賂或為威脅，均難生效。各投票人利用秘密投票的武器，足可有效的抵抗或挫敗任何外來不當的壓力。所以我盼望各位候選人和他們的助選人，都能對於秘密投票完全信賴。我更盼望將來多數投票的結果，大家都要欣然接受」。</p>
<h3 id="c6">程潛三項建議主席團曾討論 <a href="#c6" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e6" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">6</a></h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿七日電〕程潛廿六日向主席團提出之三項建議，主席團推定王雲五，潘公展等十一人研究，王等廿七日長開會研討，原則上認為應先成立綜合建議委會之類似組織，由主席團推定十人及各組審委會召集人共同組織，全面研討有關軍事，政治，經濟之建議，廿七日主席團開會時，王等曾將上午研討情形向主席團報告，希望主席團予以支持，先確定原則，再加討論，惟因時間關係，會中僅略作討論，尚未作原則之決定。</p>
<h3 id="c7">簽署代表列席國大 <a href="#c7" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e7" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">7</a></h3>
<p>投票竣事後賓行</p>
<p>〔本報南京廿七日電〕未能出席本次大會之簽署代表，要求列席國大，廿七日主席團會中會予討論，咸認列席應予允許，惟廿八日上午適值第三次選舉副總統大會，會塲席次因須布置投票處，事實上甚為擁擠，無法容納，故決定俟投票後再行列席。</p>

<h3 id="c28">看今天國大續開 <a href="#c28" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e28" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">28</a></h3>
<p>國民大會因選舉副總統發生意外的風波，已接連休會了三天。在此休會期間，雖經各方面的努力奔走和斡旋，首都的忿戾之氣確已逐漸消失；但是三位候選人放棄競選的問題，仍未能獲得一個明快而徹底的解決，尚有待今天大會作最後決定·所以全國的人民今天都顤首望着南京，懷着迫切和好奇的心情，等待今天國大的繼續開會與舉行第三次投票。</p>
<p>我們站在第三者的立塲上，觀察這個副總統競選問題，自然認為非常簡單，旣不是什麽奧妙不可測的啞謎，也不是什麼不能解決的難題。我們始終認為：候選人放棄競選的問題，只要依照總統副總統選舉罷免法所規定的辦法和程序，就有解決的途徑可尋；換句話說，國大今天開會，出席代表要投誰的票，就可投誰的票，候選人放棄不放棄，投票的代表儘可不管。話雖如此，但是從另一角度看來，這一次的競選風波，係由競選人發生誤會而起；這三位候選人如不能獲得徹底的諒解和覺悟，即使國大勉強重開舉行第三次投票產生副總統，但是內在的裂痕依然存在，將來仍足以引起新的政治糾紛，這個嚴重的危機是不容我們忽視的。所以首都的忿戾之氣能否化為祥和，今天的國大是一大關鍵。因此我們不得不向三位副總統候選人曁全體國大代表發出迫切的呼籲。</p>
<p>第一，我們希望三位候選人均能自動撤同其放棄聲明，最低限度也該毫無意氣地接受今天國大的決定。根據法律上的解釋，姑置不論，就事實而言，中途放棄競選，就不是偉大政治家應有的風度。因為這三位候選人在國大開幕之前，早就大吹大擂，積極從事競選的活動；至國大開幕之後，更是日夜奔走，大施其聯絡和拉攏代表的能事；而且投票已經二次，不論其所持理由如何充分，總是不能使人民信服的。</p>
<p>第二，我們希　全體國大代表均能本着自己的良心，自由投其最神聖的一票，這次副總統選舉，係採取無記名投票，在代表圈名投票的時候，旣沒有人監視，也沒有人阻礙，自能究全自由投票。所以我們要求國大代表在舉行第三次投票之前，都要摒除一切私心和偏見，而本着自己的良心，再三考慮究竟應該投誰一票，庶不負人民的囑託。</p>
<p>要之，今天國大重開是一個重要的關鍵，全國人民萬目睽睽，瞭望着國大代表今天依法自由投票。代表諸公，今天，莫再使人民失望了。</p>
<h3 id="c29">貼放會成立以後 <a href="#c29" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e29" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">29</a></h3>
<p>中央銀行的貼放委員會，於昨日正式成立了。在當局以為該會改組以後，性質轉變，可以達成該行成為「銀行之銀行」，因而寄以甚大之期望；但在外界，則以為它所負的任務太狹，其搆成分子，又多偏於官方，深恐於工商界未必有多大利益，深望它放寬範圍，儘量地扶助民間生產事業，這自然是一般人所樂聞說。</p>
<p>但就根本說，它不過日現行融政策上的一個技術機關，它本身並沒有固定的職權，它的職權，是隨金融政策為轉移的。觀於其前身過去兩次的情形，而得到明確的例證。所以單是希望它的範圍放大，不如直接希望國家的金融政策迅予放寬，較為切實</p>
<p>這裏所說的金融政策，實際是貸款政策，而現行貸款政策與過去顯有差別的，有下列三點，（一）為偏重國策貸款，此項貸款，得向四聯直接申請，於核准後即交國家行局辦理；（二）業務貸款，只能向銀行申請，在原則上，而且以銀行一部分自有之存款信堆，（三）在　　一，國策貸款，仍許　受低利的　遇，榮務貸款，則須按照市面，酌量伸縮，今姑將利息一層撇開不談，今日一般行莊，究有多少頭寸，堪供商家週轉？行莊無力承做這項貸款，又何從向中央銀行由請貼放？假如向中央銀行申請抵押，或重貼現時，該行會不會拿出緊縮銀根這個理由來作為檔箭牌？</p>
<p>行莊本來是調劑金融，扶助工商的機關，在資金缺乏不敷運用的時候，國家銀行原有隨時接濟的義務，否則如何能成為「銀行之銀行」？不過在這抽緊銀根，成為抵消通貨膨脹的無上法寶時，一切存放匯兌，俱要受到嚴格的檢查與限制，在某一時期，和某些地區，且公然遭受禁止，絕對不許工商界放款，我們實無理由，敢倌商業行莊，會樂於承做這項業務貸款；也無理由。可信這項業務貸款，可順利地做到轉抵押或重貼現的。</p>
<p>我們說這幾句話，並不是意味着，金融當局不知道上面這種情形，而且今日商業行莊實力的薄弱，與工商界週轉的困難，他們所知道的，恐怕要比一般人更為深切。其所以一味抽緊，不肯積極地予以扶助，無非為通貨太膨脹，遊資太充斥，打算向行莊管制得嚴密些，以期砥柱中流，勿使物價渦於高翔罷了。他們的用心自是很苦，却不知道洪流氾濫，一瀉千里，在這時候，斷非築一這短短的堤防可以擋得住，徒然使工商界挹注無門，坐以待斃；更以匯兌困難之故，使都市的成品，與內地的原料，無法交流。</p>
<p>現在經濟界的情形，每况愈下，大有岌岌不可終日之勢，我們盼望金融當局懲前　後，翻然悔悟，把整個的金融政策，再行檢討一下，至於貼放會的範圍如何放寬，還是枝節之事。中央銀行張總裁昨會宣佈，該行將採取新貼放政策，以改善當前的金融。但願這個新貼放政策，不要一味是消極的，而應替國家想想，同時也得替商民想想，銀行的損益帳，固須注意；而整個的國民經濟，更不容忽視。</p>

<p>整補部隊搶修鐵路下月上旬可能　動</p>
<p>〔本報瀋陽廿七日電〕自四平戰後，東北戰局沉寂已一月有半，此一時間內，匪方主要動向，一為整補部隊，除補充各野戰縱隊慘重傷亡外，並抽集各地地方部隊，編成十二個獨立師。據估計：其第一綫部隊已有四十萬人，較前增加百分之五十。一為搶修鐵路，其企圖欲以哈爾濱為出發點，南下吉林，經梅河口，折至四平西，以齊齊哈爾為起點，沿平齊綫抵四平，構成一循環補給綫，一面搶修大鄭綫，由通遼至新立屯，直指遼西前綫。某觀察家謂：觀匪方補充及修理情形，已大部完成，同時泥濘時期已過，匪又迷信五月，故下月上旬可能有戰事爆發。冀東熱境匪調動頻繁，未來主戰塲可能在遼西，國軍已洞燭其奸，將予大打擊。</p>

<p>〔本報信陽廿二日航訊〕矮個子結實的身材，和靄的面龐，儒將的風度，這便是馳聘中原建立奇功的張軫將軍的輪廓。他是河南羅山人，過去在河南打過游擊，今天又在河南剿匪，眞不愧為「保家鄉衛國土」的典型軍人。豫南父老稱他為「保姆」，共匪呌他「小鋼砲」，他的氣魄之偉，於此可以想見。　記者此次趕赴駐馬店，走進司令部，和趙副司令官一陣寒喧之後，侍衛便引我去見張將軍，踏入他那節陋而整潔的臥室兼會客室，我頓時感到這五十開外的老將生活是那樣的樸實而嚴肅，令人肅然起敬。張將軍笑嘻嘻地遞來了一支烟捲，同時，他自己也燃着了香烟，迎抽兩口，便開始滔滔不絕的長談。</p>
<p>上月十九日，將軍奉命東進潢川，北上新蔡，斯時劉匪之一，二，十，十一，四個縱隊，已於該地集結，待將軍所部到達，劉匪即妄想消滅其主力，但將軍未卜先知，早匪一步發動攻勢，劉匪措手不及，遭此奇襲，潰不成軍，紛紛後退，匪受此打擊，遂施行鬼計，擺開布袋陣地，以三，六，縱隊魏鳳樓獨立旅及十蹤隊之一部，渡渦沙河，佯攻阜陽，實際企岡誘張部向正面進攻，跌入渠之布袋網，使之一網打盡，將軍窺破鬼計，旋避開正面，向其側翼攻擊，匪軍苦費心機。騎虎難下之際，乃猛攻阜陽，而企岡擊潰張部主力之心仍未死，然而事實上已成為一件絕不可能的事。</p>
<p>阜陽大戰危急之時，將軍率部馳援，向匪軍側背攻擊，劉匪經兩日之掙扎，企圖全陷絕望，於三日晨開始撤退，將軍當即跟踪追擊，由臨泉，沈邱，項城，汝南，直至駐馬店，如是七日之疲勞追擊，每日除戰鬥外，尚行軍八十里至一百里，將軍所部，士氣愈戰愈旺，匪軍則越打越怕，迄竄入駐馬店止，匪軍彈盡糧絕，疲憊不堪，據該地老百姓說：他們都以麩麵雜糧充飢，匪之團長集合士兵訓話，詢問所屬是否願意攻打確山，士兵默默不言，無一人應答，由此可見，匪勢實已喪氣寒心。此次追擊戰之統計：匪傷亡萬餘人，潛逃四千餘，俘虜六百餘，其中包括華中軍區俘處管理處長量紹明以下高級官長五人，鹵獲步槍六百支，輕重機槍十餘支，小砲六門。</p>
<p>談到這裏，記者立到輕鬆的話題：「張司令官，你能告訴我一點過去的經歷嗎？」他笑笑，興奮地繼續　談，從他短短的談話中，我充分地知道他的成功是不平凡的·他十五歲入陸軍小學，十八進陸軍中學，中途曾一度輟學，旋卒業於保定軍校九期，嗣又赴日深造，廿四歲畢業於日本士官十四期步兵科，返國後，由排長，連長，而營長，至十五年已為上校團長，次年，因戰功升任少將師長，江西剿匪時代，任劉鎭華之參謀長，抗戰爆發，接充湯恩伯十三軍軍長之職，擊敗日寇於合兒莊，保衛大武漢‘參加隨繫會戰，殲滅敵人之精銳師團，這三次戰役，奠定了他今日祟高的地位。</p>
<p>民國卅年，統率六十六軍，指揮第一次印緬戰役，現任陸軍訓練司令孫立人將軍，當時即為渠之師長，次年調任中訓團副教畏，繼調十四集團軍副總司令，抗戰末期，坐鎮豫·鄂·皖·邊區，與頑敵週旋，豫省半壁江山，未遭敵寇踐，實由蔣軍豐功所致，勝利后，首任鄭州綏署副主任，繼調武漢行轅副主任，現兼第五綏靖區司令官，馳騁中原，掃蕩共匪，其饒勇善戰之態，豫南父老無不耳熟能詳。</p>
<p>將軍談風甚健，足足談了兩小時，毫無倦意，最後，記者詢其嗜好，渠答：平日喜打太極拳，每天寫日記，十五年來，從未中斷一天，而且，勤於做詩，現在從他的日記上順便抄下一首：「提到傷心無恨事，多情每抱不平鳴，江河廣大能容物，虎豹兇殘也被擒；養性自尊還自慰，樂天尤已不尤人；孔門弟子今何在？沂上絃歌馬上聞。」（四月十日作）</p>
<p>黃昏，記者向他告辭，步出司令部，他那親切的握手與堆滿了笑容的臉，使我的腦海中深深的刻劃着：這經歷卅年戎馬生涯的老英雄，依舊是那樣年靑！（本報特派華中區戰地記者卜眠）</p>

<p>— 鴻嘉</p>
<p>——記王卓友先生</p>
<p>和王卓友先生成為一次鄰居之後，我對他的印象才改變過來了。</p>
<p>他是位名人，在兩家大學裏教課，所授的倫理學，社會學課程是最受學生們歡迎的。不用說，人出了名，自然要變得忙起來：在街上，我們便會常常碰到一輛破破爛爛的包軍，裝着頗帶幾分福相的王卓友先生，由那個搜骨稜稜的車夫有氣沒力的拖着到處在跑。</p>
<p>一次，朋友A請客，我有緣認識了王卓友先生。在同席的七八個客人中間，他底年齡最長，有五十來歲了，而社會地位也比較高，所以大家在談話時也都奉他為中心。而他呢，也不愧是位博學的長者，對於一切社會，政治，經濟等類煩複的問題，都有深刻透澈的見解，聽着他有條有理的談吐，誰都會感動，而由衷地對他起敬佩之心。</p>
<p>席散時，A特地拍拍我底肩膀說：</p>
<p>「老×，你不妨時常向王先生請教請教，你一定可以得到不少教益。」</p>
<p>我點點頭。雖是第一次見面，但我的確對王卓友先生已有了極好的印象。</p>
<p>我沒有去訪問他。因為我覺得他底工作很忙，打擾他不大好。</p>
<p>不過和他在別的塲所見面或聽他談話的機會却慢慢增多了，我們已成為熟人。當他坐在那輛包車上打街上走過時，一見到我，便雙手抱拳向我一拱，這種客套的禮節，雖使我不免感到　迫，但決沒有影響我對他底敬仰心理</p>
<p>在迭次的接觸後，我知道他是位克魯泡特金主義者。對於克魯泡特金的學說，他鑽研得極深。當他發揮互助學說，以悠揚頓挫的調子闡釋人類愛的時候，即使犬馬聲色之徒聰着也會有動於中的。</p>
<p>很榮幸，我有機會成為他底鄰居了。</p>
<p>原先，我借住在一位同事家裏。但這位同事的岳母帶了她底剛畢業的三女從鄉間進城來考學校了。這樣，我借住的那間屋自非搬出不可。</p>
<p>我正為此而感到焦急，A却跑來告訴我，王卓友先生處最近搬走了一個豈房客，假便我願去塡空，大概是不會成問題的。</p>
<p>屋子有方丈見寬，在棋下，光綫上不算錯。使我疇躇的是租金貴了一點，要五斗米一月·由A週旋的結果，兩担米的押租是免繳了，租金則依市上的米價八折計算。為此，王卓友先生還向我表示十二萬分的歉意說：</p>
<p>「這屋于本是空起的，照說也應該讓給老兄住。不過，說實在話，在本地找房子不容易，就是這間破屋子吧，也不知有多少親戚朋友來向我交涉過了，現在租給老兄，他們還多我的心哩！至於租金這一層，我這裏一律是五斗米一間，現在給老兄一點優待，算是我的一點心意。不過，」說到這裏，他突然加重了語氣：「千萬不能讓別的房客知道，不然，可就增加我底麻煩了。」</p>
<p>說到這裏，他無端地縱聲大笑起來。笑過一陣之後，却感慨着說：</p>
<p>「生活不易呵，我這頭老牛給揹慘了，三個孩子，一僩上大學，兩個高中，要不是靠房租津貼一點，簡直拖不起走了。可是，房租也收不起，五斗米在此刻算個啥子？」</p>
<p>成為王卓友先生底房客之後，接近他底機會却並不增多。他白天很少在家，回家後也不輕易下樓。有時，在院子裏碰到時，他照例是雙手一拱，往往等不及我回禮，便匆匆過去了。</p>
<p>他家裏一共有八口人。三個兒子都寄宿在學校裏。此外除了王卓友先生本人和他底車夫之外，還有他底那位有着股魚脚的太太，一個管燒飯的聾子老婆婆，和一個發育不健全而面目滿是蠢相的打雜丫頭。這三位女性都像幽靈似的，整天都很少聰見她們說話。可是，只要王卓友先生一回家，樓上便可叮咚咚的忙亂起來了。他時常在大聲地叱駡什麽，好像一切都不合他底意似的。</p>
<p>「狗×的！老子……」那聲音不再像暢談互助，人類愛時那麽美妙動聽了，而變得粗暴殘忍。</p>
<p>起初，這使我很感奇怪，且為之苦惱，屢次問着自己：「道也能是王卓友先生嗎？」但慢慢地也就見怪不怪了。</p>
<p>一次，二更過了，我正打算睡，突然，嗆啷一響，像是一盞杯盞在樓上摔碎了。——一剎那的寂靜，接着便是暴風雨湧來了：</p>
<p>「狗×的！你沒了魂！好好的一隻洋磁杯，安心要把它振爛！哼，看老子敢不敢揍脫你的皮！」王卓友先生的喉嚨像竹管被劈破了似的大叫起來。</p>
<p>「啊！」一聲女孩子的驚慌的尖叫，接着是淸脆的兩響耳括子。</p>
<p>「荷荷荷……女孩子哭起來了。</p>
<p>「你還哭！老子歡喜你哭！」那聲音更是怒不可遏了。</p>
<p>「哇」的一聲，背上又是沈重的「冬冬」幾下，一陣急亂的脚步聲夾着哭嚷跑出屋子去了，祗有王卓友先生的大喉嚨在靜夜裏震盪：</p>
<p>「看老子明天餓你飯！」</p>
<p>以下是一連串的臭駡，我不想再聽了，急忙上壯用被蓋蒙住了頭。</p>
<p>四個月後，由於賢明當局的管制有方，米價忽然成為脫　的野馬，比我搬進王卓友先生家時漲上了十倍。五斗米的租金實在不是我所能負担的了·不得已，我只好靦顏向他請求减租。「這個，這個……」他第一次對我皺起眉來，沈吟了半　後，才說：</p>
<p>「這應該是沒有問題的，不過，我最近也實在拖不起走，而且，减老兄的租雖是小事，可是教我怎樣去對付其它的房客呢？」</p>
<p>問題沒有結果，他答應再去考慮考慮</p>
<p>十天後，他底那位鰻魚脚的太太突然光降我底屋子了，東說西問了一陣之後，終於說明來意道：</p>
<p>「學校快放暑個了。我們幾個孩子都要回家來，家裏騰不出空地方，你先生不見外，我們想把這間屋子……」</p>
<p>我便不等她說完，答應住到月底決定搬走。</p>
<p>在我搬家前的晚上，王卓友先生慇勤的請我在他家裏吃飯。也許是酒喝多了吧，他顯得興奮極了，滔滔不斷地暢談着互助，人類愛等等的老調。他被自己底言辭感動了吧？眼眶裏的淚水在電燈下閃光，但我却一句沒有聽進去，不時下意識地看着那個正在我們身邊侍候的蠢丫頭，她木然地聽着他底老爺底智慧的談話，不時用小偷般的怯生生的眼光偷覷着他。</p>
<p>現在，我仍然不時地遇到王卓友先生。他還是長得那麽福相，那輛破爛的包車一也新，上了漆，可是一那個車夫却更瘦了，一跑路時更是有氣沒力一了。自然，他免不了要向我雙手抱拳一拱，而我，也照例笑着點點頭，心裏呢，却眞相葉一扒口水。（四月在蓉）</p>

<p>春已經剩了尾巴，我一個勞人，自然沒有尋春之興，湊巧要回到浙東的故鄉，來去必經地是杭州，讓湖光山色盪滌一下煩器的胸襟該是偶然而難得的所謂「緣」。</p>
<p>最初，我計劃雙峰之遊，那分峙南北的兩高峰，沿北峰一帶，只有　隱的飛來峯可以一看，　光太單調了，三個天竺屬於黃布袋之羣的趨拜　，而且更覺着枯燥，黃色的梵宇，撩人的香烟而已。所以，我比較一下還是喜歡上南峯綫去，那兒，從靠枕錢塘江面起，一路　環的山谷，確乎值得我們　展的。這也是我的一個在杭朋友將赴任宣平縣長的陳宗恩抽空給我作的攔導。</p>
<p>我們從湖濱出發，趁公共汽車直上秦望山，到之江訪文學院長顧敦鍒，他陪我們參觀新　備的建築教材及車床儀器等，在他自題的留雲閣內小坐，憑窗望平曳的江流，想到焚書坑儒的秦始皇東游登此山的時候，宗恩對我說：「不料幾千年後的今天這裏了最高的學府。」</p>
<p>下秦望山，我們拾級跑到六和塔的第七層，據說這是錢膠王鎭江潮的故事，但廟裏的和尚硬指點着說這是蘇秦和六國的紀念，大概塔名的巧合，加以比鄰望山傳誤的原故　？　後，我們叫車上虎跑。</p>
<p>在夾通松　　中走入大慈寺，一　虎　泉，這果水含凝質的關係，冲上茶來眞是滿了也不曾翻溢了的。茶座的　後是俯削的山壁，底下一隻石虎，還有一個洞，似乎告訴我們山君剛竄出來呢！這算補綴上從前一個挂錫僧夢虎跑而得泉的傳說之證。過去，滴　崖，刻着馬一浮的詩，有「坡老無心得一撮」句，和濟公塔畔　翁題的一聯，倒引起我的神往。</p>
<p>時間實在太匆匆了，我們也只有匆匆的　展，烟霞洞不及去，到了石屋古洞看了下滄海浮螺，就跳上歸車，那像螺殼形的岩洞，使我記起拾遺記云：</p>
<p>「有大螺名躲步，負其穀露行；冷則復入殼。明王出世，則浮於海際。」</p>
<p>準是那露行的大螺忘記了殼，被嵌向這兒，或者那時這一帶屬於海尾部份，給造化小兒斬了尾，化成千萬巉岩，浮於海際的大螺來不及逃跑作了如來的掌吹弟子。我這樣自迷其說，橫豎雙峰一湖之間，多的是神話。然而，浮螺該象徵太平的，眼前的時代正燒遍了烽煙。</p>

<p>羅斯金的情書</p>
<p>英國文學批評家羅斯金（John　Ruskin）曾經追求過美麗的女郎愛菲·格蕾（Effie　Gray）。威廉·詹姆士（Admiral　Sir　William　James）新近編了一本「羅斯金與愛菲格書」，其中收集了不少的書信。愛菲格蕾於終於嫁給羅斯金，但在六年的結婚生活之後，又告仳離。愛菲格蕾却「一點也不以為她曾經做過羅斯金的妻　一</p>
<p>愛菲格雷</p>
<p>罷斯金不願與志趣不相投的女子結婚。他們倆的離婚或者由於他的妻子是一位有社交野心的人吧？</p>
<p>這位藝術批評家在二十八歲的時候就寫情書給愛菲，信中帶有合羞的溫柔，和一個未婿者將與美麗女郎結婚的假想。似乎他的技巧勝過他的眞情，他還怕愛菲的誘惑。</p>
<p>他有一封信說：「我不知道怎樣比擬你。你像帶有愉快空地的甜蜜森林。人們漂泊到那兒，走到中心，感到寒冷而不能通過。愛菲，你是這樣的可惡，你自已却不知道」。</p>
<p>他又有一封信，是被稱為「狂熟的愛情」的：「我自己的愛菲，我仁愛的愛菲，我的女主人，我的朋友，我的王后，我的愛人，我唯一的愛，你是多末的好，我今天不能回答你一個字。半小時後，我要與我的母親進城去，有許多事情要做，但我首先要寫覆信給你。我永遠不會忌妒你的。我要保持較純潔的忌妒形式，想望更多的戀愛，在一定的限制以內。」</p>
<p>不過他專心一致地工作的時候，會把戀愛忘掉。「我忙於建築，有時差不多完全忘記了關於你的一切。」當他爬上禮拜堂頂或山頂的時候也是如此。「當我畫山的時候，我忘記了我自己和我的妻子。」</p>
<p>威廉藏有六百三十三封信，所發表的只有三分之一。除羅斯金和愛菲外，還有他們兩人的父母的信，愛菲在一八五四年所再嫁的丈夫米萊斯（Millais）的信。</p>
<p>得利賽的遺著</p>
<p>得利賽</p>
<p>得利賽（TheodoreDreiser）是美國的大小說家生前想寫一部「慾望三部曲」（Tri　ology　ofDesire），第一部「資本家」（The　Financier）出版於一九一二，「巨靈神」（The　Titan）出版於一九一四。這兩本書對於美國小說方面有永久的影響，好幾讀者都等待着第三部的完成。隔了三十年，現在「克慾者」（The　Stoic）居然出版了.我們可以猜想得到，為什麼這本書他生前不出版。這本書他曾艱苦地工作，有兩三個結尾，讓他那繼承版權的子女去選擇；但他無論怎樣改作，總不能達到前兩部的水準。</p>
<p>第一部是最動人的。「資本家」一書融合經濟，政治，戀愛而為一。故事本身和高潮都很能吸引讀者。考卜島德（FrankAigernon　Couperwood）入獄的原因有二：一個是公開的，他動用市政府的公款去賭輸了；還有一個是秘密，他誘姦布特勒（Efward　Malia　Butier)的女兒。布特勒是管理費城的政治三巨頭之一，這個人在三部曲寫得最生動，甚過主角考卜烏德。</p>
<p>第二部「巨靈神」把性愛和財富錯綜地隔章寫着。財富的部分比性愛的部分寫得好。</p>
<p>倘若我們一檢「美國傳記辭典」，就可以找出其中一條是關於耶克斯（Charles　Tyson　Yerkes，</p>
<p>1837-1905）的，你可以看出得利賽所寫的考卜烏德，與耶克斯是怎樣的恰合。耶克斯的生活也是可以分為三個部分的。起先是他在費城的冒險，包括入獄情事。第二次幸運是他賣去街道，外面有關於他離婚和重婚的謠言。後來他管理了芝加哥街道鐵路，接着是賄賂的鬥爭。</p>
<p>耶克斯的第三部曲是他賣掉了街道鐵路，得到一千五百萬美元的贓款。他到倫敦去，要想控制倫敦的自來水管，他的罪惡，比得利賽敢說的話還要大。</p>
<p>他在財富上快要達到勝利的時候，就因重病而逝世。死後他的財富都逐漸散光。他所夢想的自由醫院不曾造成，他所計畫的造給紐約人的大師們的畫苑也拍賣了，芝加哥的拍賣行無望地破產，倫敦的自來水管該是他的主要的紀念，成功以後卻被別入佔有了。</p>
<p>得利賽的第三部曲由於作者不大懂得倫敦，不能寫得十分成功。他又不能把耶克斯的事全部寫進去。他的後繼者對於其中兩三點歷史上的錯誤也不會改正。</p>

<p>— 念鴻</p>
<p>人往往有「零借整還」的脾氣，平時點點滴滴拖欠下來的，逢時逢節，一齊設法歸還，情願在幾天裏趕得傷頭爛額，却從不想到隨時隨地留心注意，以免於臨渴而掘井。像牆脚壁角裏的垃圾灰塵，總不高興每天費些力氣用掃帶拭拂一下，直到近了除夕，才來一個大掃除，化去一整天功夫，動員全家人馬，也許依然來不及收拾。讀書亦然，假使平常用功夫，考試時節便不需要什麼夜車通宵，界得筋疲力盡，成績仍不見佳。這個通理，看是很淺顯，可是要把弊病革掉，却是難上加難。</p>
<p>歷來的聽明人們也許有鑒於此，知道人們「一曝十寒」的心理的不易取消，便不得不想出定某月某日為某某節的辦法來，一則提醒大家，不要忘了這件事，一則也可借此把平日積欠，淸償一下，用意原佳。譬如提倡孝道的，便想法設一個父親節母親節；重視下一代的，設個兒童節靑年節，諸如此類，漸漸地日曆本上的紀念節愈來愈多，像八八，九九，十十等凡是容易記得牢的日子，都己定為什麽什麽的紀念日了。</p>
<p>三八節近，婦女們開始被人注意，報上可以常我到關於提高女權的文章，每年提起的幾個婦女問題又展開了廣泛的討論；接着便轉到了靑年前途的問題，至於兒童，那更是未來的主人為，兒童福利，絕對不容忽視，因為時光已經從三八進為三月二十九和四四了。過了四四，該是工人們的日子；而當勞工節過去，勞工問題，似乎已跟着解決，大家便熱忱於宣傳母愛的偉大和崇高了；六月裏，往往是逢着詩人節的，文藝副刊上有詩的特輯；不久，一連串紀念神聖抗戰的揭開和偉大勝利的光臨；國慶之後，這種陶醉和感慨逐漸褪色，人們意識到一年的逝去，並且開始準備怎樣度過一年一度的聖誕和除夕。自然，娼妓問題仍舊要被討論，兒童健康比賽也仍舊要舉行的—當又一次婦女節兒童節到來的時候。</p>
<p>運動會之後，體育便算提倡過了；防癆運動週之後，肺病好像得到了特効藥；交通安全週之後，市虎傷人也就可以不管；五四之後，弄文藝的即使餓死，至多不過贏着一聲嘆息而已！</p>
<p>聞人要員們整年為開會演說而忙碌，革命先烈和抗戰英雄只有在這時候被緬懷追念。「節」的意義，早已模糊不可辨認，然而每逢什麽紀念日，盛况終是空前，大家熙熙攘攘，興高采烈地討論研究，究竟得到了些什麼，也許是誰也難回答的罷？</p>

<p>— 弘賢</p>
<p>看到報上登出消息，銀行界計算帳目已廢除角分。但是，實際上對於一元，十元，百元等單位，又何嘗不是虛設呢？試問現在去銀行收解和兌取現款，遇着千元以下的數目，又何嘗能認眞兌付？到不如把千元以下的單位都略而不計，反而合乎實際些。</p>
<p>要使兒童了解貨幣的單位，在今後也更加困難，他們只曉得有千元以上的鈔票可用，什麽百元十元都早已忘在腦後，至於幾角幾分更成為抽象的東西，這也眞是一個悲劇。</p>
<p>記得去年四川鄉下，有一老太太，把積存十年的二角鈔票拿來買肉，當被拒絕，瞪目莫知所措，報上曾當作新聞刋出，惟不知後之視今，亦將如今之視昔否？</p>
<h3 id="c145">春遊 <a href="#c145" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e145" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">145</a></h3>
<p>— 談客</p>
<p>春將去矣！除了將棉袍脫下換上夾衫而外，春對找沒有什麽影響。水門汀地上沒會有過變化，天空仍是原先的一片。墊居在都市裏的人聽膩了汽車的喇叭呌聲，看厭了人羣的熙攘景象，很想逃出鴿棚似的家，去和大自然來親近一下，被煤烟燻黑了的鼻子也大有吸收一下淸新空氣的必要。當是為了這些原故，大批「上海人」擁出了「東方巴黎，」作一年一度的——多麼可愛的名辭！——春遊。然而春遊也還是有福的人才能享受，我就沒有得到這個福分。我計劃中的春遊，目的地是杭州，時間是一星期，　望像太奢了一點，但我認為「取法乎上，」或得其中，杭州去不成或是逗留時間不滿一星期，原則上的春遊總能如願實現的，不想，春將去也，春遊之舉看樣子還是難產。</p>
<p>杭州的朋友屢　來信「促駕」，先是誘惑式，說西湖之春如何如何的美，大好春光，放過實在太可惜；後來索興大駡我不解人生趣味，說我暮氣沈沈，對於春也是無動於中。另一位廣東的朋友則又來信問我杭州之「春」「遊」過沒有，要我火速寄幾幀照片，寫一篇遊杭報導寄去。他以為我與杭州間僅數小時火車的行程，每星期去一次也不算什麽，殊不知事有未盡然者。套一句孟老夫子的說法作為結束吧：余豈徧愛水門汀地，煤烟味哉？余不得已也。</p>

<p>— 東方黎明</p>
<p>有一天，俄國思想雜誌的編輯室裏，走進來一個老人，穿着羊皮外衣，載着皮帽子，他手裏拿着一份稿子。秘書從他的手裏把稿子接過來；那是一個農民叫謝米諾夫的所寫的一篇小說。秘書叫那老頭子回去，到兩個禮拜以後再來聽回話。至期，那老頭子又來了。秘書叫他在那裏等着。這個時候，兩個編輯和一位出版家，正在書房裏興奮地談天和暍紅酒。秘書進來宣稱外邊有人等着聽農民謝米諾夫那篇小說的回話。雜誌文藝欄的編輯是一位個子很高，生得一頭很漂亮的頭髮，留着一把分成兩叉的美髯，戴着眼鏡的靑年人：</p>
<p>「是的是的，我已經讀過了，讓他等一會，我立刻就去見他。」</p>
<p>然而，那種興奮的談話，是沒有法子可以打斷的，所以不知不覺之間，時候就過得很久了。大約一小時半的樣子，秘書又出現在書房門口。</p>
<p>「米托芬，尼洛維契—那個老人還在外面等着呢！」</p>
<p>「是的，是的，我馬上就去見他。」</p>
<p>又是很多時間過去了，秘書第三次去催請，那編輯才把那份手稿找出來，走到會客室裏。</p>
<p>「那個老頭子在什麽地方啦？」</p>
<p>那位穿羊皮衣的老人，從木椅子上站起來。編輯就向他走過去：「上次送謝米諾夫這篇稿子來的是你嗎？我已經把這篇小說看了……」</p>
<p>那編輯把眼皮抬起來看老人，突然把還沒有話完的話停止了。原來站在他面前的，正是大名鼎鼎的列奧·尼古拉維契·托爾斯泰。他一直安安靜靜地坐在那裏，等了兩個以上鐘頭。</p>
<h3 id="c147">論先例 <a href="#c147" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e147" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">147</a></h3>
<p>— 余龍冠</p>
<p>社會上許多事情無端的受着阻礙，無由發展和進步，「例」可說是其中原因之一。記得前次報載大學學生要求全部公費，教部的發言人說是：「外國尚無先例」。這不禁使人有些感想。我覺得這無所謂例不例，更不需要要以外國為例，而應當純粹視國家財政如何而定。人家沒有規定，我們就不能實行，這豈非笑話！同時又覺得太可憐了、別人定着每個國民必須受義務教育，我們又為什麽不能普遍實施呢？我國倘亦富裕的話，不管大中小學都來個免費入學，使人人皆得求學，教育機會均等，人民知識水準駕乎世界各國之上，又何嘗不是件美事，為什麼我國事事要跟在人家後面，不能追上一步，另創一格？國人心上被「例」的圈套所束往，無怪萬事受着影響了。</p>
<p>再如機關中有些事務的推行，亦必有着先例，才保你不出亂子。有相當工作經驗和上了年紀的人，遇事總得查案，查明前例如何。「例」我們不敢說是毫無一援的價值，但其本質上決非是部寶鑑’許多事以往的例並不一定適合今日之用，正如全部歷史，在使人明瞭過往變遷及其因果，藉能鑒知來，作為處理今事的參攷。事事以前例作為規範，充其量祗能做到蕭規曹隨，這尚係從好的方面而言，已是無法超越突出了，倘例之本身就有了問題，則其後果是不難想像的！</p>
<p>凡事都有個起始，經過，和終了，如大家都墨守成法，依例而行，則前事之例何由創出？因此，我們祗能把例作為遇事參考，不能奉為圭果，更不能把思想囿于例的範疇內，來限止着進步。我們應該開創新的好例，才能日有進步。大至國是，小于個人瑣事，無不如是，必須竭力突破「例」的圈子，一切才能邁向新生的途徑。</p>

<p>— 復廬</p>
<p>驛亭蕭寺中，題壁詩詞，每多佳句，大抵勞人思婦，船脣馬背，浪跡天涯，滿懷抑鬱凄楚之思，發於篇章，類皆性情之作，與吟風弄月者不同。余嘗見雪鴻偶鈔二卷，搜羅極其豐當，作者殆亦半生南朔銷盡輪蹄者歟？爰就歷年所見，摭拾一二；</p>
<p>戰前遊南京後湖，見湖神廟壁間題有署名環天者和許苓公一律，蘊藉低徊，似落魄京華孤懷不遇者，黃季剛曾依韻和之。詩公：落盡櫻桃燕子來，水亭掃净戰時埃，風雲西北爭王氣，賓主東南迓上才；湖柳湖烟非弱水，山花山鳥傍強毫，未隨許掾朝金關，先逐征蓬賦七哀。</p>
<p>羅田巖，在雲都南郊，周濂溪岳武穆嘗遊其間，風景幽邃，別有洞天。二十八年初夏，友人劉菁如適宰斯邑，曾邀余一遊，見壁間有馬心是題小詞三闋，菩薩蠻云：淸宵自酌三鐘酒，淚珠雨滴傾百斗，極北望烽烟，胡塵正滿天。榴花紅似血，不敢心頭熟，坐老在羅巖，含情月一灣。訴衷情云：華年深怕暗中拋，微雨訴今宵，江郎自有彩筆，莫當作畫眉描。多感慨，逞情豪，寫牢騷，纔醒又醉，已倦還歌，最是無聊。望江南云：淸夏好誼暑，不見名山，翠樹凉雲迷遠岫，淸衆流水遶明　，得意儘盤桓。歸而訪諸邑人宋月寰，知馬君少有大志，嘗躍馬出函谷關，十載風塵，鬱鬱不得志，眼　而歸，設帳山中濂溪祠，為童子師，日以杯中物澆胸間塊壘，宜一腔抑塞溢於聲咏也。</p>
<p>往歲飲長汀酒樓，見壁題七律兩章，不著作者姓字，意地居閩贛邊疆，自明季以來，載經離亂，故作達曠之論，而風格絕似板橋。詩云：（一）結廬何必在山村？心遠偏多古意存，破甕栽花貧不諱，野蔬當肉妙難言，冬烘愛著黃棉襖，晝寢閒安白板門，盡日養慵兼養病，醉醒一任世昏昏。（二）敗筆殘書不值錢，此中眞樂自陶然，招來好友兩三個，吟得新詩四五　，治　何妨越視，　秋忘得晋秦年，　　混沖完吾　，聲古元多未闢天。</p>

<p>— 吳庸</p>
<p>天地間事物，殊少十全十美者，故對某事其物予以抨擊反對，必可博得一般人的贊成同情，而且事實上那些抨擊之辭往往是對的；你如贊成同情某事某物，必感不易落筆，而且必遭人們的抨擊反對。此於書評亦然。對於一本不愜意的書，我們可以寫出一篇頗為精闢的評論，對於一部精闢的著作，便頗難寫出一篇愜意的書評。換言之，不好的書可以產生好的書評，好書不易引起好的書評。淸代金聖嘆評水滸西廂等「才子書」，有多處往往只是「妙」，或「妙，妙」，或「妙極，妙極」等字樣，蓋是只覺其文章之錦繡，而竟一時道不出錦繡在何處，又不頤不予表揚一番，不得已只好先脫口而出，喊出一個「妙」字，慢慢再行思量妙在何處，而終於思量不出，乃只得以一「妙」字終結。</p>

<p>「副總統」選舉因為競選的人數較多，所以格外顯得熱關。那幾位大名人的政見，各報的社論，都是巨製鴻篇，崇論宏議，都是從政治或法律的立塲出發的大文章，老朽看了，惟有贊嘆。說點故事，以備參證，亦野人獻曝之意也。</p>
<p>按普通職銜之所謂「副」，亦常有兩層作用：（一）是參佐，（二）是準備。例如舊科舉時之正副主考，除北闈外，各省都是一正一副。入闈閱卷，事實上是各中半數，平分春色。而名義上，則正考官為主，副考官為輔。如兩人中之一人忽然發生意外，而至不能行其職務或缺位時，則其他一人即須閱定全榜，負整個的責任。所以至少須簡放兩位，不只為帮忙，亦「以備不虞」也。正者缺位，則副者主特全局，若副者缺位，則正者主特全局。衡文旣各有一部分實權，而準備又是相互的作用。故「副」之解釋，甚有伸縮，事實上　是準備的成分多。</p>
<p>民主國家總統之次，有副總統Vice　President。其與科舉之副座不同之點，為平常並不參預總統的事，但遇總統缺位，則立即繼承，行使大權。（杜魯門之繼羅斯福完成勝利，即是「一朝權在手，便把令來行」，即現時之顯例。）故所謂「副」者更是「準備」作用，而意義則相當重大。</p>
<p>民國初年黎黃陂當選副總統後，發表通電，以典雅之詞句，示　抑之心情，內有「元洪備位儲貳」一語，聰說是秘書長饒漢祥的手筆，乃因襲前代皇太子的成詞。古時的太子，呌做「儲君」，所以有些報上的小塊文章故作戲謔之詞，說黎黃陂自居於太子，置袁克定於何地？似乎笑談，其實「儲君」原即準備之義。太子之準備繼承君位，與副座之準備總座，原則實是相同，偕用成詞，只說「儲貳」，亦還無傷大雅。（「儲貳」亦是太子的別稱，但避開「君」字，即不甚礙眼，斷章取義，未為不可。）</p>
<p>美國的副座，雖無實權，而關係極重·况中國「法治」方在萌芽，情形又與美不同，「人」的準備，更不可少，則副座選舉之傾動遐邇，萬目睽睽，不亦</p>

<h3 id="e1">The National Assembly Decides to Follow the Morning Session Format to Conduct the Third Round of Voting for Vice President; Sun Ke and Cheng Qian Express Their Willingness to be Elected <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Office, 27th] The National Assembly, which adjourned for three days, is scheduled to reconvene at 9:00 AM on the 28th to conduct the third round of voting for Vice President. At 4:00 PM on the 27th, the Chairman convened a meeting which, after two and a half hours of discussion, finalized this agenda. The Chairman and Presidium also held close discussions on how to maintain order in the venue on the morning of the 28th to ensure the smooth progress of the assembly. It was generally agreed that inflammatory publicity materials should not be distributed within the venue, and the Presidium hoped that those involved with the various campaign teams would urge their respective teams to pay attention to this. It is expected that Hu Shi will be appointed as chairman for the assembly on the morning of the 28th. Regarding the declarations by the three vice-presidential candidates to renounce their candidacy, the Presidium representatives Yu Bin, Hu Shi, Chen Qitian, Zeng Baosun, and Sun Yaofu persuaded them, and all three have indicated that they will no longer insist on renouncing. The Presidium originally had no authority to accept the renunciation of candidacy, but since the three are no longer insisting on this matter, it is deemed unnecessary to bring it up for discussion at the assembly. However, the reasons for the two-day adjournment and the process should be explained to the assembly. It was decided that Yu Wu will report to the assembly on the morning of the 28th, after which the third round of voting will proceed. As for the voting and poll monitoring supervisors for the election, 118 individuals were previously selected and will be asked to continue in their roles on the 28th.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Office, 27th] The National Assembly Presidium has decided that the third round of voting for Vice President will be held on the morning of the 28th. However, a group of representatives has drafted a temporary motion requesting the Presidium to implement effective measures to prevent manipulation, control, and coercion of the election within the venue. This will be presented at the assembly on the morning of the 28th. The temporary motion also requests Chairman Chiang to attend the assembly and report to the assembly that this vice-presidential election is a free competition, and that party members have absolute freedom in voting. It is anticipated that there will be heated debates before the election voting at the assembly on the morning of the 28th.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Office, 27th] After the deadlock in the vice-presidential election was broken, the campaign activities of the various campaign teams reached a fever pitch on the 26th and 27th. Li, Sun, and Cheng each delivered speeches to their respective campaign teams on the evening of the 27th, explaining their own motives and reasons for renouncing or continuing their campaigns, and encouraging their campaign teams to continue their efforts. Li Zongren's campaign team held a meeting at the Anle Ying at 8:00 PM on the 27th, attended by hundreds of representatives. Li delivered a speech in an excited, cheerful, and firm tone, expressing his gratitude for the enthusiastic support of the representatives, saying that this also motivated him to continue participating in the campaign and increased his courage infinitely. He stated that the Chinese people are suffering, the bandit rebellion is not quelled, and he is determined to strive for democracy and continue fighting. When Sun Ke's campaign committee held a meeting, hundreds of representatives also attended. Sun delivered a speech in a relaxed manner, stating that he is now an "should-be-elected" candidate, not a "campaigning" candidate, responding to battle rather than seeking battle, so he is determined not to engage in forced activities, but only rely on the sacred freedom granted to him by the representatives, based on their conscience. As for the activities of the campaign team, it is a matter for the campaign team itself, and he does not intend to intervene. However, Sun expressed that the rumors that there is now a negotiated solution are unfounded. When hundreds of members of Cheng Qian's campaign team gathered at the Central Hotel, Cheng spoke in a sincere manner, repeatedly explaining his earnest hope that the assembly would be completed smoothly and the vice-president would be elected as soon as possible, so that the assembly could come to a satisfactory conclusion as soon as possible. Cheng stated that he should be elected without campaigning, and that personal gains and losses are definitely secondary, but he expressed his heartfelt gratitude for the enthusiastic support of the campaign team, so he will continue to run.</p>
<h3 id="e2">Rumors of an Agreement Reached by the Three Vice-Presidential Candidates; Sun Ke Hopes Representatives Will Not Be Misled <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 27th] Sun Ke's wife visited the office of his campaign team at the Longmen Restaurant at 6:00 PM on the 27th and addressed the National Assembly representatives present, with three main points: (1) He personally made some efforts in the past for the vice-presidential campaign, but after the changes in the past day or two, the situation is completely different. He had already declared that he would renounce his candidacy, but because the Central Standing Committee of the Kuomintang and the National Assembly Presidium sent gentlemen to persuade him not to give up, he has now decided to follow the decision of the assembly and continue to run to complete the election process of the Vice President of the National Assembly, but in the future he will not engage in any campaign activities, only "respond to election." (2) There have been many rumors recently, including that the three vice-presidential candidates have reached an agreement and the results have been obtained, and that someone will be elected as vice-president, someone will be the premier, and someone will be the president of the Legislative Yuan. This is absolutely not true. He himself is one of the candidates for the vice-presidency and has never participated in any negotiations with other candidates. Moreover, the vice-president is elected by all the representatives of the assembly, and the premier is nominated by the future president and can only be determined after being approved by the Legislative Yuan. The President of the Legislative Yuan must be elected by all members of the Legislative Yuan. (3) He expressed his gratitude to the representatives for their greatest assistance and support in the past, and hoped that the representatives would freely choose those who can serve the people and contribute to the construction of the country and the suppression of the rebellion, and give them support and support. When casting their sacred and conscientious vote, he hoped that they would not be misled by rumors.</p>
<p>[Another Dispatch] A spokesperson for Cheng Qian's campaign committee released a statement on the 27th, stating: (1) Cheng's renunciation of the election was intended to ensure the smooth completion of the assembly. If the renunciation of the election affects the assembly, it would be contrary to his original intention. Therefore, he voluntarily accepts the decision of the assembly. However, Cheng will only be elected without campaigning, that is, without any activity to win the votes of others. (2) After the principle of free election is determined, the committee hopes that this principle can be firmly maintained, so that every voter can be free from enticement and threats, and not be subject to any other improper interference. (3) Cheng believes that comprehensive reforms must be implemented today in order to save the crisis and complete the suppression of the rebellion, and that the appointment of virtuous and capable people is a prerequisite for implementing reforms. If he is fortunate enough to be elected, he will use his position as an old friend and subordinate of the President to promote its realization. If the election fails, he will also fight as an ordinary citizen for the reform of politics. He has reached the age of retirement, but was ordered by the President to extend his service until June of this year. After the extension expires, he will be able to engage in general political and social movements.</p>

<p>[Our Nanjing Office, 27th] National Assembly Representative Lin Zigui, due to the twists and turns in the vice-presidential election, specially proposed three proposals on the 27th for the assembly's reference. More than a hundred representatives have now endorsed them. His proposals are: (1) The resignation letters of the vice-presidential candidates should be returned immediately and the election should continue. (2) Before the election, Chairman Chiang is requested to attend the meeting to announce the Kuomintang Central Committee's repeated guarantee of a free election, and all candidates are requested to swear before the portrait of the National Father that regardless of the success or failure of the election, they will definitely unite sincerely, assist the head of state, and be loyal to the cause of suppressing the rebellion and building the country. (3) In order to eliminate misunderstandings, all campaign teams should voluntarily cease all activities, and constitutional groups organized for support should also announce their termination.</p>

<p>[Our Nanjing Office, Nanjing, 27th] After Li Zongren, Sun Ke, and Cheng Qian all expressed that they would no longer insist on giving up the election, the three candidates had frequent contacts on the 27th. In the afternoon, Sun Ke and Li Zongren visited Cheng Qian separately, and Cheng also visited Li and Sun's residences separately after Li and Sun's visits. Also, Sun Ke visited Wu Tiecheng, Long Yun, and others on the afternoon of the 27th. Huang Shaohong also visited Wu Tiecheng on the afternoon of the 27th.</p>

<p>Hoping that Candidates and Campaigners Trust the Secret Ballot System</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 27th] A reporter recently asked Dr. Hu Shi for his views on the Vice Presidential election. Hu replied: "Many disputes arise from a lack of full confidence in the anonymous voting system. I had a very good impression of the first two Vice Presidential elections. During the first vote, I even served as a supervisor and had the opportunity to observe closely. I saw that the order was good, and there were no malpractices at all. The entire process was of educational value to the participants. We should have a strong conviction that secret ballots can fully guarantee the fairness of elections, and that any external pressure or bribery or threats will be difficult to take effect. Each voter can use the weapon of the secret ballot to effectively resist or frustrate any improper external pressure. Therefore, I hope that all candidates and their campaigners can fully trust secret ballots. I also hope that everyone will gladly accept the results of future majority votes."</p>
<h3 id="e6">Cheng Qian's Three Suggestions Were Discussed by the Presidium <a href="#e6" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c6" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">6</a></h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Office, 27th] The Presidium appointed Wang Yunwu, Pan Gongzhan, and eleven others to study the three suggestions made by Cheng Qian to the Presidium on the 26th. Wang and others held a long meeting on the 27th to study them, and in principle believed that a similar organization to the Comprehensive Recommendations Committee should be established first, which would be jointly organized by ten people appointed by the Presidium and the conveners of each committee, to comprehensively study military, political, and economic recommendations. When the Presidium met on the 27th, Wang and others reported the situation of the morning's discussion to the Presidium, hoping that the Presidium would give its support, first determine the principles, and then add discussion. However, due to time constraints, only a brief discussion was held at the meeting, and no decision on the principles was made.</p>
<h3 id="e7">Signing Representatives Attend the National Assembly <a href="#e7" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c7" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">7</a></h3>
<p>Departing After Voting is Completed</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Office, 27th] The signing representatives who were unable to attend this assembly requested to attend the National Assembly.

<p>[Another Dispatch] Chairman Chiang personally wrote a preface for Mr. Yu Youren's 70th birthday, the full text of which is as follows: The cause of the revolution originated in the Lingnan region, and the response to the drums and trumpets spread throughout the mechanical world. The martial achievements and literary virtues of the wise men are all inspiring. As the old home of political, educational and cultural relics, Qinzhong has a rugged terrain, and there are righteous men and brave soldiers everywhere. Mr. Yu of Sanyuan has really managed it. Since his commission and alliance, advocating doctrine, as a general of great responsibility, in charge of the winds and the constitution, for fifty years, Chen Li Bangguo, his achievements are obvious, in the eyes and ears of the people. In the past, on Mr. 's birthday, he also tried to write about his actions, which were passed down in poetry. Now, at the beginning of constitutional government, and Mr. is seventy years old, Zhongzheng has been through thick and thin for a long time, and the mutual understanding is deeper. To summarize his life, there are two things that have surpassed others: First, to have foresight and to promote the Tao, to examine the situation, and once the ambition is set, it will not be changed. The Zhou Dynasty is vast and straight as an arrow, and the loyalty to the country is consistent from beginning to end. This is Mr.'s steadfast act, which can be a model for the world. The base is wide and elegant, the embrace is vast, and the good is followed, and there is rarely any denial. As for the great virtue, it is only where righteousness lies, gentle without offending, and clear and moderate. This Mr. 's moderate character can be a model for scholars. Celebrating birthdays is the same inside and outside China, and giving people words is the custom of Xia Dynasty, sincerely admiring the gentleman of the world. Especially when there is leisure, he said: "The screen is the pen, and the hundred officials are the constitution." And he said: "May the gentleman live ten thousand years, and may you be blessed." In times of hardship, the great task is not yet completed. Continue to work hard to appease the four directions. Emphasize virtue and add meals. I hope we can encourage each other! Respectfully wishing you all the best, Chiang Kai-shek.</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, Xi'an Dispatch, 27th] Our army, having recovered Yongshou, Bin County, and Fufeng, advanced from north to south on one route, and from east to west on another route, having crushed bandits in Linyou and Yidian. The eastern route army immediately advanced and occupied Qishan. At noon on the 27th, a band of bandits from the direction of Guozhen, who arrived from Fengxiang, seeing our large army approaching, took civilian clothing, disguised themselves, and fled towards the outskirts of Bin County, intending to launch a sneak attack. They were discovered and completely annihilated by the national army and local militia in the area. Our Baoji national army took advantage of the situation to pursue, and it is expected that they will join forces with the national army moving west tonight, and then attack northwards. At present, a band of bandits, numbering approximately six thousand, is fleeing south from Liulin Town in Fengxiang (east of Dianyang) north of Baoji, threatening the airport north of Bin County, and has engaged in fierce fighting with our army.

To obtain supplies and military goods, or to attempt to occupy Baoji, the heart of southern Shaanxi, the national army has strong troops stationed there. However, during this period, it is inevitable that the national army will abandon strategic locations, such as a county or town, in order to concentrate its forces and strike the bandits. He said: The national army in southeastern Gansu has made thorough deployments. However, in recent days, the people have been unclear about the war situation, and morale is inevitably fluctuating.

<h3 id="e28">Looking at the National Assembly's Continued Session Today <a href="#e28" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c28" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">28</a></h3>
<p>The National Assembly has adjourned for three consecutive days due to the unexpected controversy surrounding the election of the Vice President. During this adjournment period, although efforts have been made by various parties to lobby and mediate, the resentment in the capital has gradually dissipated; however, the issue of the three candidates withdrawing from the election has not yet been resolved in a clear and thorough manner, and awaits the final decision of the Assembly today. Therefore, the people of the whole country are looking towards Nanjing with anxious and curious hearts, waiting for the National Assembly to continue its session and hold the third round of voting today.</p>
<p>Standing in the position of a third party, we naturally believe that the Vice Presidential election issue is very simple, neither an inscrutable mystery nor an unsolvable problem. We have always believed that the issue of candidates withdrawing from the election can be resolved by following the procedures and methods stipulated in the Presidential and Vice Presidential Election and Recall Law; in other words, the National Assembly can vote for whoever they want at today's meeting, and the voting representatives can ignore whether the candidates withdraw or not. That being said, from another perspective, this election controversy was caused by a misunderstanding between the candidates. If the three candidates cannot achieve thorough understanding and awareness, even if the National Assembly reluctantly reopens and holds a third round of voting to elect the Vice President, the internal cracks will still exist, and will still be enough to cause new political disputes in the future. We cannot ignore this serious crisis. Therefore, whether the resentment in the capital can be transformed into peace and harmony is a major key for today's National Assembly. Therefore, we have no choice but to make an urgent appeal to the three Vice Presidential candidates and all the representatives of the National Assembly.</p>
<p>First, we hope that all three candidates can automatically withdraw their statements of withdrawal, or at least accept the decision of the National Assembly today without any emotion. Leaving aside the legal interpretation, in terms of facts, withdrawing from the election halfway is not the demeanor of a great politician. Because these three candidates had already been vigorously engaging in election activities before the opening of the National Assembly; after the opening of the National Assembly, they were running around day and night, exerting their ability to contact and win over representatives; and the voting has already been held twice. No matter how sufficient their reasons are, they will not be able to convince the people.</p>
<p>Second, we hope that all the representatives of the National Assembly can vote freely with their own conscience. This Vice Presidential election adopts secret ballot. When the representatives sign their names and vote, no one is watching or obstructing them, so they can vote completely freely. Therefore, we ask the representatives of the National Assembly to eliminate all selfishness and prejudice before the third round of voting, and consider again and again with their own conscience who they should vote for, so as not to fail the entrustment of the people.</p>
<p>In short, the reopening of the National Assembly today is an important key. The people of the whole country are watching closely, observing the representatives of the National Assembly voting freely according to law today. Representatives, do not disappoint the people again today.</p>
<h3 id="e29">After the Establishment of the Rediscount Committee <a href="#e29" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c29" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">29</a></h3>
<p>The Central Bank's Rediscount Committee was officially established yesterday. The authorities believe that after the reorganization of the committee, its nature has changed, and it can achieve the bank's goal of becoming a "bank of banks," and therefore place great expectations on it. However, the outside world believes that the task it bears is too narrow, and its constituent members are mostly biased towards the official side, fearing that it may not be of much benefit to the industrial and commercial sectors. It is hoped that it will broaden its scope and provide as much assistance as possible to private production enterprises, which is naturally what the general public likes to hear.</p>
<p>But fundamentally speaking, it is only a technical institution in the current financial policy. It does not have fixed powers of its own, and its powers are subject to the financial policy. This can be clearly illustrated by the past situations of its predecessor. Therefore, simply hoping that its scope will be expanded is not as practical as directly hoping that the country's financial policy will be quickly relaxed.</p>
<p>The financial policy mentioned here is actually the loan policy. The current loan policy is significantly different from the past in the following three points: (1) Emphasis on national policy loans. These loans can be applied for directly from the Big Four banks, and after approval, they are handled by national banks and bureaus. (2) Business loans can only be applied for from banks and are, in principle, based on a portion of the banks' own deposit funds. (3) In the first case, national policy loans are still allowed to receive low-interest rates, while business loans must be adjusted according to the market. Leaving aside the interest rate issue for the moment, how much capital do general banks and stores have available for merchants to turn around? If the banks and stores are unable to make these loans, how can they apply for rediscount from the Central Bank? If they apply for mortgages or rediscounts from the Central Bank, will the bank use the reason of tightening credit as a shield?</p>
<p>Banks and stores are originally institutions that regulate finance and support industry and commerce. When funds are lacking and insufficient for operation, national banks have an original obligation to provide assistance at any time. Otherwise, how can they become a "bank of banks"? However, when tightening credit becomes the supreme magic weapon for offsetting inflation, all deposits, loans, and remittances are subject to strict inspection and restriction. In certain periods and certain regions, they are openly prohibited, and commercial and industrial sectors are absolutely not allowed to make loans. We really have no reason to believe that commercial banks and stores will be happy to make these business loans, nor is there reason to believe that these business loans can be smoothly re-mortgaged or rediscounted.</p>
<p>We say these few words not because we mean that the financial authorities do not know the above situation. Moreover, they probably know the weakness of the strength of commercial banks and stores today, and the difficulties in the turnover of the industrial and commercial sectors, more deeply than the general public. The reason why they blindly tighten and are unwilling to actively support them is nothing more than that inflation is too high, and floating capital is too abundant. They plan to control the banks and stores more strictly, in order to stem the tide and prevent prices from soaring. Their intentions are certainly very bitter, but they do not know that when floods are rampant and flow thousands of miles, it is by no means possible to stop them by building a short dam, which only makes it impossible for the industrial and commercial sectors to obtain funds and wait for their death; moreover, due to the difficulty of remittances, the finished products of the cities and the raw materials of the interior cannot be exchanged.</p>
<p>The situation in the economic world is deteriorating day by day, and there is a great danger of being unable to make ends meet. We hope that the financial authorities will learn from the past and repent, and re-examine the entire financial policy. As for how to broaden the scope of the Rediscount Committee, it is still a trivial matter. Central Bank President Zhang announced yesterday that the bank will adopt a new rediscount policy to improve the current finance. We hope that this new rediscount policy will not be just passively, but should think for the country, and at the same time think for the merchants and people. The bank's profit and loss account must be paid attention to, but the entire national economy cannot be ignored.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper Xinyang 22nd Air Dispatch] A short, sturdy figure, a kindly face, the demeanor of a Confucian general, this is the outline of General Zhang Zhen, who galloped across the Central Plains and established extraordinary achievements. He is from Luoshan, Henan. He used to fight guerrilla warfare in Henan, and today he is suppressing bandits in Henan again. He is truly a model soldier who "protects his hometown and defends his country." The elders of Southern Henan call him "Nanny," and the Communist bandits call him "Little Cannon." His greatness of spirit can be imagined from this. This reporter rushed to Zhumadian and, after a brief greeting with Deputy Commander Zhao, the guard led me to see General Zhang. Stepping into his humble but clean bedroom and reception room, I immediately felt that the life of this old general in his fifties was so simple and solemn that it was awe-inspiring. General Zhang smiled and handed me a cigarette, and at the same time, he lit his own cigarette. After taking a few puffs, he began to talk endlessly.</p>
<p>On the 19th of last month, the general was ordered to advance eastward to Huangchuan and northward to Xincai. At that time, Liu's First, Second, Tenth, and Eleventh Columns had already gathered in the area, waiting for the arrival of the general's troops, Liu's bandits妄想eliminated their main force. However, the general was prescient and launched an offensive one step ahead of the bandits. Liu's bandits were caught off guard and suffered a surprise attack, collapsing into disarray and retreating one after another. After suffering this blow, the bandits implemented a cunning plan, setting up a "pocket" formation, with the Third and Sixth Columns, Wei Fenglou's independent brigade, and a part of the Tenth Column, crossing the Wo River and feigning an attack on Fuyang, actually企岡诱 General Zhang's部 towards the front, fall into their pocket网, make their to be be all wiped out, the general saw through the鬼计, then avoiding the正面, attacking its側翼, the bandits hard費心機. Riding a虎難下, they猛攻Fuyang, and企岡 to break through the张部main force of the heart still未死, However, in fact has become an absolutely不可能的事.</p>
<p>At the time of the crisis in the Fuyang War, the general led his troops to aid, attacking the side and back of the bandit army. After two days of struggling, Liu's bandits企图 全陷绝望, began to withdraw on the morning of the 3rd. The general immediately tracked and pursued, from Linquan, Shenqiu, Xiangcheng, Runan, all the way to Zhumadian. Such a seven-day fatigue pursuit, in addition to combat, still marched 80 to 100 li per day. The general's troops became more and more courageous in battle, while the bandit army became more and more afraid of fighting, until they窜入驻马店. The bandit army was exhausted of ammunition and food, and exhausted. According to the local people, they all filled their stomachs with bran flour and mixed grains.

The important cases decided at the meeting are as follows: (1) The food rationing by headcount in this city was originally scheduled to be handled for four months: March, April, May, and June. Now, because July, August, and September are in the lean season, it is necessary to continue to maintain rationing and sales. Calculated on the basis of 5 million people in the city, a total of 1.5 million dan of rice will be needed for rationing in three months. The U.S. will supply 750,000 dan, and the government is responsible for planning 750,000 dan. There is absolutely no problem with the supply of U.S. rice. The supply of national rice is being contacted by Wu Kaixian, Director of the Social Affairs Bureau, who is going to Beijing to contact the Ministry of Food. (2) Starting next month, the quality of rice will be improved as much as possible, and good rice will be supplied first. Starting next month, the allocation of rice to each rice store will be increased by 30% to allow citizens to choose at will. (3) The Ministry of Food recently stipulated that the amount of rice rationed should be unified nationwide, so starting next month, the rationing will be restored to 15 catties per person (15 catties and 2 taels per person in April). The Ministry of Food also stipulates that the price of rice must not be divided into two types. The rice price in this city for May will be determined and announced by the Three-Person Deliberation Committee at 5:00 PM the day after tomorrow (the 30th).</p>

Coincidentally, during the Fifth General Assembly, the case of donating land from Hardoon Garden has been publicly resolved to be accepted and handled by the Municipal Government. However, there is still no suitable public assembly place in this city. Therefore, it is suggested to build a Chiang Kai-shek Memorial Hall on the donated land of Hardoon Garden, which will be used exclusively for public gatherings and to commemorate the event. The methods are as follows: (1) Please allocate five mu of land from the land donated by Hardoon Garden as the site for building the Chiang Kai-shek Memorial Hall. (2) The content of the Chiang Kai-shek Memorial Hall should focus on being suitable for public gatherings. In addition to a few offices, the rest should be assembly halls, with a standard seating capacity of 2,000 people. (3) The construction funds will be appropriated from the Hardoon Charitable Foundation, and the shortfall will be raised from all walks of life. (4) Establish a Chiang Kai-shek Memorial Hall Preparation Committee to be responsible for designing the drawings, raising funds, and supervising the construction project. The candidates for the committee members will be hired by the mayor. (5) The groundbreaking ceremony will be held on the day of President Chiang's inauguration. If preparations are not completed in time, the date will be scheduled separately.</p>

Except for Lao Hongbin and Lao Xiangtai, which committed gold and banknote cases, the temporary licenses for the other 151 gold shops, including Fang Jiuxia and Yongji, will be issued immediately after passing through the Finance Bureau. Then, the discussion began, and it was decided: (1) All gold shops that have not yet applied for a license must apply for a supplementary application before May 20th. Applications will not be accepted after the deadline. (2) Approval was given to issue licenses to Lao Tianhuaxingji, Zhu Tianbao, and Yongxingfaji. (3) Lao Jiuyun and Lao Qingbaorenji were approved, but the guarantor on the joint guarantee form must be replaced because they are not qualified. (4) Qiu Jiufu is not a member of the association. The Social Affairs Bureau will send someone to investigate before reviewing it again. (5) In the future, if gold shops are found by the police to be engaged in black market gold and banknote transactions, the police bureau should forward the investigation when the case is found and the processing method is completed and reported to the Municipal Government for approval before notifying the Social Affairs Bureau and the Financial Management Bureau separately.</p>
<h3 id="e71">The "Leather King" is Accused of Being a Traitor; Claims to Have Assisted Underground Personnel in Setting Up a Secret Radio Station in the Factory; "Military Uniform King" Zou Shanbao Sentenced <a href="#e71" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c71" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">71</a></h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] The case of Gu Huanzhang, the "Leather King," being accused of suspicion of being a traitor was previously declared innocent by the High Court, but the Supreme Court returned it for retrial. Chief Judge Xiao of the High Court summoned Gu for questioning a few days ago and ordered him to be detained in court. Yesterday morning, an investigation court was opened. Chief Judge Xiao took his seat and brought Gu from the High Court Detention Center and summoned Shen Zhenjia, the worker administrator of the Gongyi Leather Factory, and Lu Guowei, the accountant, to testify. According to Gu's statement: He is a leather merchant. During the occupation of Shanghai, he was forced to sell leather to the enemy because he was under the oppression of the enemy. He was also forced to participate in the position of chairman of the puppet leather industry association. During the enemy-puppet period, he secretly communicated with the First War Zone and purchased four firearms in Pudong, entrusting a staff officer of a certain advance army of the Third War Zone to take them to Ningguo. Although he himself did not go to Ningguo at that time, he had in fact surrendered long ago. Several underground workers of the Third War Zone came to Shanghai and lived in his home, and a secret radio station was also set up in his factory. Later, the witnesses were summoned for questioning. The case was adjourned because it still needed investigation, and the defendant was returned to custody.</p>
<p>Zou Shanbao, the "Military Uniform King," who once served as the chairman of the puppet military uniform industry association, was accused of suspicion of being a traitor. The High Court sentenced Zou to two years and eight months in prison yesterday.</p>

<p>Zhao Yulin, director of the Shanghai Office of the Special Economic Investigation Department of the Ministry of Economic Affairs, told reporters yesterday about the progress of his work and analyzed the three main ways in which communist bandits are currently carrying out economic conspiracies in Shanghai: (1) Using companies and firms as cover, nominally engaged in commercial operations, but in reality, specializing in smuggling materials to aid the bandits. The smuggled materials are mainly sanitary medical equipment, cotton yarn, and grain, which are most urgently needed by the communist bandits. (2) Using coastal sailing vessels to engage in barter trade to obtain urgently needed materials. The illegal trading activities are mostly carried out secretly outside the Wusong Estuary. (3) Every time there is economic market unrest in Shanghai, they push the boat to add fuel to the fire, expanding the disturbance activities. He said: The Special Economic Investigation Department will focus on launching an economic sweep against the communist bandits in its jurisdiction in the future.</p>

<h3 id="e79">Rejection of Mandatory Regulations for Coal Transport Vessels to Qinhuangdao <a href="#e79" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c79" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">79</a></h3>
<p>The Fuel Management Committee, in order to expedite the transport of coal stockpiled in Qinhuangdao, previously notified the Shanghai Shipping Association with an emergency measure, requiring that all vessels with a tonnage of 3,500 tons or more dispatch a ship to Qinhuangdao at least once a month to load stockpiled coal, or face cancellation of their coal allocation rights. After receiving this notice, the Shipping Association convened an emergency meeting yesterday afternoon. All members present decided to reject this mandatory regulation from the Fuel Management Committee. In fact, of the 180,000 tons of coal stockpiled in Qinhuangdao this month, 120,000 tons have already been shipped to Shanghai, accounting for three-quarters of the total, demonstrating the large volume of transport. Technically speaking, there are distinctions between riverboats, seagoing vessels, passenger ships, and freighters. A 3,500-ton riverboat is technically incapable of navigating the Bohai Sea route, otherwise accidents are likely. Furthermore, the transport price for coal is vastly different from general freight rates. In order to maintain minimal profitability, an adjustment to the transport price will be requested from the Fuel Management Committee. It was decided to send a letter to the Fuel Management Committee, responding that the emergency measures are difficult to implement. However, the utmost effort will be made to transport coal from Qinhuangdao, and a higher transport price is requested in order to maintain operational costs.</p>

<h3 id="e84">District Attorney's Office Indicts Eight Defendants in Air Freight Overcharge Case, Wu Jing'an and Wang Zhu's Evidence of Criminality Insufficient <a href="#e84" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c84" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">84</a></h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The Beijing office of China National Aviation Corporation was reported for allegedly raising freight rates without authorization, a case suspected of fraud. After investigation by District Attorney Ding Chuan'en, the defendants—Dao Anping, Acting Head of the Business Section of China National Aviation Corporation, Jiang Nengxiang, Head of the Freight Section, Xu Xin, Head of the Beijing Office, Yan Duzhou, Former Head of the Beijing Office of China National Aviation Corporation, Deng Haozhang, Head of the Operations Section, and Zhou Peiran, Wang Zuoliang, and Qi Nianzu, who are at large—are indicted under the Anti-Corruption Statute for taking advantage of the difficulty of transportation between Peiping and other areas, colluding to monopolize air freight, exploiting merchants, and raising freight rates without authorization, from which they profited. As for the defendants Wu Jing'an, Manager of Jing'an Enterprise Company, and Wang Zhu, Chief Secretary of China National Aviation Corporation, since their involvement was only due to improper administrative measures and the evidence of criminality is insufficient, they will not be prosecuted.</p>
<p>The facts of the crimes in the indictment are extracted below. The indictment states that since around July of last year, when Taiyuan was disturbed by bandit troops and land and water transportation were cut off, all import and export goods relied on air transport for maintenance. The China National Aviation Corporation and Central Air Transport Corporation and their Beijing office staff colluded with merchants, creating fictitious businesses, and successively monopolized the Peiping transportation business, while formal transport merchants were refused freight transport when they contacted the airlines, resulting in a large amount of corruption and widespread public criticism. The facts of the crimes are described as follows: (1) Regarding the Hua Mao Company's contracting of the China National Aviation Corporation's freight transport portion, Zhou Peiran, the former head of the China National Aviation Corporation's Kweisui office, used the name of the China National Aviation Corporation on July 7 of last year to raise prices. Dao Anping, the head of the business section of the China National Aviation Corporation, and Jiang Nengxiang, the head of the freight section, contracted the Peiping air freight. Liu Anping, in the name of the business section, wired Xu Xin, the head of the Beijing office of the company, to handle the matter illegally, allowing Zhou Peiran to pay a freight rate of 21,200 yuan per kilogram. Because Zhou Peiran was not familiar with the business community and could not attract freight transport, he entrusted Zhang Zhongzhi, who was familiar with the business situation, to contract for a commission of 2,000 yuan per catty. In total, he collected 18 tons of merchant goods, charging an average of 44,000 yuan per kilogram, for a total freight revenue of 752 million yuan. After paying 281.6 million yuan to the China National Aviation Corporation, Zhou Peiran netted more than 400 million yuan, and the illegal profits were shared among Liu Anping, Jiang Nengxiang, Xu Xin, and others. (2) Regarding the Heji Company's contracting of the China National Aviation Corporation's freight transport portion, Wang Zuoliang, the owner of the Heji Cloth Store in Beijing, took the opportunity to collude with the head of the Beijing office of the China National Aviation Corporation on July 11 of last year, creating a fictitious Heji Company and contracting Peiping air freight, transporting more than 50 tons of merchant goods. Wang Zuoliang paid the China National Aviation Corporation a freight fee of 11,200 yuan, but charged customers as much as 50,000 yuan or 55,000 yuan per short kilogram. In total, he collected 2,734,337,500 yuan, of which only 1,134,530,000 yuan was paid to the China National Aviation Corporation. The profits illegally obtained with Xu Xin amounted to 1,599,835,500 yuan, and Wang Zuoliang forged accounts to cover up the crime. (3) Regarding the Dabe Company's monopoly of the China National Aviation Corporation's freight transport portion, Qi Nianzu, a businessman in Shanghai, agreed with Deng Haozhang, the head of the business section of the Central Air Transport Corporation, and Yan Duzhou, the head of the Beijing office, to allow him to nominally contract the air transport from Peiping to Taiyuan in Beijing. He successively transported 21 tons and 186 kilograms of goods from merchants in Peiping. Except for 6 tons and 82 catties transported by air freight, the Central Air Transport Corporation transported 15 tons and another 140 kilograms. Qi Nianzu charged merchants 21,200 yuan per kilogram for freight, paid the Central Air Transport Corporation, and illegally collected more than 200 million yuan in freight, which was divided between Deng Haozhang and Yan Duzhou.</p>

<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Three municipal buildings at Nos. 1365 to 1367 on Changning Road in western Shanghai, which had recently been completed and divided into apartments for rent, were preparing to open for business. Unexpectedly, at around 1:20 AM yesterday morning, a fire broke out suddenly at No. 1365, instantly piercing through the roof and spreading rapidly, and extending to Nos. 2366 and 1367 next door, as well as a large number of shantytowns in the back alley, over seventy in total. The fire was raging and unstoppable. After receiving the report, the Jing'an Temple Fire Brigade immediately dispatched several hose wagons to extinguish the fire. Before long, the Fahua, Huashan, Central, and Yichang sub-brigades, as well as the Caojiadu and Zhenru private fire brigades, arrived to assist in the rescue. However, due to the lack of fire hydrants nearby and the difficulty of obtaining water, the fire was not extinguished until after more than an hour of rescue efforts. While the fire was raging, five residents, two men and three women, were injured when jumping from the building. Those seriously injured included Zhou Linmei (female, 26 years old), with a fractured spine, and Tao Guangjin (female), with a concussion and loss of consciousness. Zhu Wenqi (male, 28 years old) suffered broken hands and feet and was sent to the Red Cross Hospital.

<p>Request Submitted to Municipal Government for Approval of Measures</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Police Bureau has replied to the Shanghai Municipal Council regarding inquiries from councilors at the Fifth General Assembly about the Police Bureau's policy reports. Regarding the question of how to resolve the issue of vegetable markets becoming residences for beggars every night, hindering hygiene, the Police Bureau stated that it has repeatedly ordered each branch bureau to detain and send vagrants and beggars to various relief organizations. From September of last year to the present, a total of 7,758 vagrants and beggars have been detained and sent. However, due to the limited economic resources of various organizations and the limited number of places they can accommodate, and with the increasing number of refugees fleeing from bandit-controlled areas to Shanghai, there are difficulties in accommodating beggars. The Bureau has requested instructions from the Municipal Government on how to handle the matter. Furthermore, regarding the case of "Russian roulette" gambling being rampant in restaurants, the Bureau stated that if gambling with property is involved in "Russian roulette" in restaurants or public places, it is prohibited. However, pure entertainment is not restricted.</p>

<p>[Report from Our Newspaper in Suzhou, 27th] Chen Zizhan, courtesy name Junming, a Shanghai cotton yarn merchant, came to Lingyan Temple in Suzhou on the 25th for a Buddhist ceremony following his mother's death. After more than a hundred relatives and friends ate a vegetarian meal, they suddenly experienced abdominal pain and vomiting, resembling poisoning, as reported in yesterday's newspaper. It is now learned that most of them, due to their mild symptoms, left the mountain and returned to Shanghai that day. Only about twenty people, due to symptoms of dizziness, stayed overnight at the temple. The next day, accompanied by the host, they also returned to Shanghai for recuperation. The Suzhou County Police Bureau, considering the unusual cause of the case, has assigned a special officer to be responsible for thoroughly investigating the truth. According to a doctor, if tung oil is mixed into cooking oil, abdominal pain, vomiting, and diarrhea will occur after eating stir-fried dishes, and even loss of consciousness, but recovery can be expected within one or two days. If this is true, the cause of the case should be due to unclean cooking oil. When Chen Zizhan and his party returned to Shanghai, they brought a small amount of leftover cooking oil to Shanghai to be tested by experts in order to investigate liability. Therefore, the truth of the case will soon be revealed.</p>

<p>Demanding the Prohibition of Foreign Employees Publicly Trading</p>
<p>The Shanghai Fish Vendor United Association, due to the long-unresolved case of the Shanghai Sixteen Puxu Fish Trade charging fish vendors 2.5 cents per yuan for foreign employees, and because salted and dried fish products are not openly traded in the fish market but are all transported to Sixteen Pu for sale, believes that this monopolizes the market and manipulates prices, causing great suffering to fish vendors. Therefore, yesterday, they dispatched representatives Rui Chang, Li Songlin, Yu Tang, and Yu Jingqing to Beijing to petition the Ministry of Agriculture and Commerce, the Ministry of Finance, and other departments, requesting the prohibition of foreign employees and requesting that all types of fish products be concentrated in the fish market for open trade in order to facilitate fish vendor purchases.</p>

<h3 id="e95">Yarn Control Committee Consults with Relevant Organizations on Cotton Yarn and Cloth Supply Issues, Factories' Applications for Cotton Allocation Have Been Continuously Contracted, and Negotiations for Cotton Yarn Transport and Sales to Hong Kong Have Been Successful <a href="#e95" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c95" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">95</a></h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The Yarn Control Committee invited responsible persons from the Central Bank, the Federation of Textile Industries, and the Textile Export Commission for a luncheon meeting yesterday afternoon to discuss issues related to raw cotton supply and cotton yarn and cloth transport and sales.</p>
<p>According to the Yarn Control Committee: the Committee has been expediting the handling of emergency cotton allocation applications from various factories in recent days. As of the 27th, there are 26 applicants for cotton allocation from outside the city, including Danyang Wanxin, and 31 applicants from this city, including Lun Chang and Dafeng, totaling 57. (Among them, six factories, including Zhaofeng, Dafeng, Guoxin, Hosin, Danyang, and Wanxin, have applied for the second time.) 18 factories, including Lun Chang and Chongxin, have already signed contracts, and the remaining factories are in the process of negotiating contracts.</p>
<p>Zhang Sili, director of the export department of the China Textile Construction Corporation, was dispatched to Hong Kong the week before last to contact the person in charge of the Hong Kong Industrial and Commercial Supply Office on matters related to cotton yarn transport and sales. He has now completed his mission and returned to Shanghai from Hong Kong the day before yesterday. It is reported that this trip has yielded concrete results. The Textile Construction Corporation has decided to supply 9,270 bales of cotton yarn to Hong Kong in stages, including 20-count yarn and 32-count yarn. It is heard that the first batch will be shipped out soon. The company sold a total of 13,710 bales of cotton yarn to Hong Kong last year.</p>
<p>[Another Report] According to the person in charge of the Yarn Control Committee, speaking to reporters: (1) The Committee will soon announce detailed measures regarding the ordering, allocation, and utilization of 700,000 bales of American cotton. (2) Since the commissioning of cotton merchants to purchase domestic cotton, the total number of bales that have been shipped to Shanghai has reached 300,000. There is no fear of a shortage of raw cotton supply. (3) It is rumored that after the lifting of the ban on southern transportation of cotton yarn, it triggered a surge in cotton cloth prices, but in fact, this was artificially created and has nothing to do with the opening of southern transportation. (4) In the past, the monthly quota for southern transportation of cotton cloth was reviewed and announced by the Committee. This time, the quota limit has been lifted, and there are no restrictions on the export of cotton cloth to the south.</p>
<h3 id="e96">Affected by Rising Prices in Producing Areas, the Rice Market Is Rising Briskly, with Top-Grade Japonica Rice in the Northern Market Reaching 4.25 Million Yuan <a href="#e96" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c96" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">96</a></h3>
<p>The rice market is slowly rising, and yesterday's market showed another increase. Due to the daily increase in prices in Wuxi, holders of goods are strongly raising prices, increasing by about 10,000 or more. However, the outflow is still sluggish, and with a slight increase in arrivals, the market is still expected to slightly decline. In the southern market, white japonica rice rose by 100,000 yuan, early indica rice rose by 50,000 yuan, and white yuan rice, due to scarce arrivals and brisk sales, rose by 200,000 yuan, opening high at 4.5 million yuan.

Yesterday's arrivals were 3,874 dan in the southern market and 2,151 dan in the northern market.</p>
<p>Flour</p>
<p>The market wanted to rise, but with strong selling pressure, the market lacked the strength to rise and remained in a range-bound situation.

Lao Che Flour fell by 10,000 yuan, and Hongfeng Jiancheng flour saw little change. Bran was strong early but weak later, and wheat factory prices remained unchanged at 2 million yuan.</p>
<p>Miscellaneous Grains</p>
<p>Prices fluctuated. The factory side had few customers for yellow soybeans, and the market declined due to sluggish sales. Early-crop soybeans fell by 50,000 yuan. Early-crop beans were in short supply, and supply and demand were equal, so the market was firm. Corn stocks were low, and Qingdao's quotations rose again. With continuous absorption by customers, the price rose by 150,000 to 200,000 yuan. Red sorghum rose by 50,000 to 70,000 yuan. Tea beans saw little change. Sesame from Tianjin was being purchased again, rising by more than 100,000 yuan. Raw peanuts were expensive and sluggish, while secondary grades were brisk, with fluctuations of more than 100,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Cooking Oil</p>
<p>Prices rose, especially for raw oil, as customers from Qingdao patronized the market. Qingdao Jitung raw oil closed at 10.1 million yuan, and was even quoted higher at 10.2 million yuan, rising by 300,000 to 400,000 yuan. The factory side had a large supply of soybean oil, with a price of 8.75 million yuan, and then the price of retrieved goods opened at 8.78 million yuan, up 60,000 to 70,000 yuan. Raw vegetable oil rose slightly by 50,000 yuan, and Tianjin buyers purchased small-batch sesame oil, rising by 350,000 yuan. Soybean cake had no sales, transactions were scarce, and the price fell by 20,000 yuan.</p>

<p>Hua stocks continued to struggle to gain a firm footing yesterday. Wing On Textile reached a new peak of 2150 yuan at the opening bell, but the majority opted to cash out, and soon the trend turned unfavorable with extremely thin trading volume. Most stocks suffered losses.</p>
<p>In the early morning, sentiment remained positive. Wing On Textile opened high at 2150 yuan. While No. 232 was absorbing shares, the exchange rate did not improve and there was no new stimulus, so the price quickly retreated slightly. Nos. 56 and others sold off, driving the price down to 2090 yuan. With loose credit and foreign stocks showing strength, there were several rebounds to around 2155 yuan. However, new purchases failed to keep up. Except for Tung Yih, which continued to be strongly bought by No. 220, remaining stable, the remaining stocks followed Wing On Textile into decline after 11:00 AM. Near noon, the price fell to a low of 2025 yuan. The afternoon close was 2035 yuan. Only Wing Yip reached its daily limit. Tung Yih, although retreating, still closed flat. Compared to the previous close, Wing On Textile, Sino-British, King Lun, China Silk, Commercial Press, and New China Zhabei fell by half a percent. Sino-French fell by one percent. Wing Yip reached its daily limit. Match, China Cement, and Dah Tung rose slightly. Sincere remained flat, and the rest suffered minor losses.</p>
<p>The afternoon market opened slightly higher at 2055 yuan, first reaching 2065 yuan. No. 224 and others sold off, causing a retreat to 2040 yuan. Trading volume was nonexistent, and the market seemed destined for a bearish trend. Improvements by the National Bank had no impact. After 3:00 PM, the banks and others pushed the price up to 2065 yuan again, closing at 2055 yuan. Compared to the morning close, Tung Yih and New China rose by half a percent. Yung Feng, Match, China Silk, and Lee On all closed flat. Sincere suffered a minor loss, and the rest rose slightly.

<p>[Guangzhou News] Smuggling gold from Macau into Guangzhou, where a profit of over one million yuan can be made per tael, is considered a shortcut to wealth by private smugglers. The lure of profit draws everyone like moths to a flame. According to reliable statistics, a major gold firm in this city purchases over 1,000 taels of gold from Macau daily. The remaining gold firms purchase an average of over 1,000 taels as well. This batch of gold is then transported to Shaoguan, Changsha, Hankou, and other places. This issue has drawn the attention of financial regulatory agencies, as the floating of gold on the market affects the financial stability and fuels smuggling. Yesterday, military police were notified to strictly investigate gold smuggling by land and sea. (Industry and Commerce Agency)</p>

<p>[Our Guangzhou Dispatch on the 27th] Due to the widening gap between the official overseas remittance rate and the black market rate, the problem of remittances from overseas Chinese in Guangdong province escaping to Hong Kong is becoming increasingly serious.

<p>[Our Report] The Central Bank's Discount Committee held its inaugural meeting yesterday (the 27th) at 5 PM. Governor Chang presided over the meeting. Governor Chang delivered a speech, stating, "...Recently, due to the needs of suppressing the rebellion, budget revenues and expenditures cannot match, leading to inflation. There have been criticisms from both domestic and foreign sources that bank loans are flowing into the hands of those who hoard goods, advocating that the government should tighten credit. To ensure the supply of legitimate production funds and the efficient use of financial resources, the government, in order to balance both aspects, has changed the loan review methods of the Four Banks Joint Office. It was also decided that the Central Bank should establish a Discount Committee to review applications for discounts from various banks. From now on, the Central Bank will not directly provide loans, but will specialize in rediscounting and remortgaging for various banks. National banks and commercial banks will be treated equally. The loan targets are sound production enterprises that meet the current needs of the country, thereby achieving sound management of various banks and cultivating good commercial paper to guide social funds into production." Subsequently, discussions were held on the detailed rules for the Discount Committee and the draft rules for interbank discounts. It was decided that the members would study these in detail and discuss them at the next meeting. The members exchanged opinions on the scope and principles for reviewing various types of loans, and the meeting adjourned at approximately 8 PM. It is reported that the next meeting is scheduled for next Monday (May 3rd).</p>

<p>Yesterday's cotton yarn market saw prices initially rise in the morning as customer demand continued strongly due to the lifting of restrictions on shipments from the South. 42-count Blue Phoenix fine yarn briefly jumped to 237 million yuan, but as the onward market turned sluggish, sentiment became weak, and there was widespread selling. The price finally retreated slightly to 235 million yuan, leveling with the previous day.</p>
<p>For other 42-count yarns, except for Golden City which rose slightly by one million, most were level. 21-count Double Horse yarn also initially rose briskly by three million, but in the middle of the day, it fell slightly to 157 million yuan.

From tomorrow onwards, applications for reporter registration will no longer be accepted, except for letters from newspapers in other provinces that were definitely sent before today.</p>

<p>The tennis umpires and linesmen for the National Games have all been appointed, totaling forty-seven. The chief umpire is Zhao Minheng, and the secretaries are Yu Zhizhong and Hou Danian. There are about thirty participating units in this tennis competition, and the total number of matches will exceed one hundred and fifty, making it one of the most demanding programs of the Games. The number of umpires and linesmen required is considerable, and the current staff is still afraid of not being enough to allocate. With many matches and long hours, coupled with everyone's career commitments, it is difficult to serve full-time. Therefore, in reality, it is necessary to divide into morning and afternoon shifts. Among them, a small number of umpires and linesmen are recommended from various parties, some of whom have never set foot in a tennis court and do not understand the rules of tennis games. With these people appointed by the conference, it is inevitable that the allocation of work will be affected. Under these circumstances, the tennis umpire authorities hope that the tennis community in this city will cooperate enthusiastically to ensure the smooth progress of the games. The list of umpires and linesmen appointed by the conference is as follows:</p>
<p>Zhao Minheng (Chief), Zhang Zizhen, Yu Zhizhong, Hou Danian, Feng Jiaozhun, Feng Jiasheng, Liu Nianyi, Shi Yonggeng, Cheng Yize, Hu Yunlai, Zhang Qianheng, Li Leishi, Wu Chonggong, Fu Qiang, Xie Zhaoliang, Chen Chunbo, Gao Zhenchuan, Wei Shisun, Zhan Wen, Hu Qichao, Wang Fuliang, Zhang Kui, Mao Haichu, Hu Faguang, Hu Zhongguang, Xu Shaomei, Shao Leping, Jing Renji, Luo Xiaozhang, Lu Jun, Zhang Weiming, Chen Qichang, Guo , Shi Fengquan, Yao Qingde, Ni Zhiqing, Lin Mingsheng, Zhou Shenjing, Zhang Qianglin, Chen Juntan, Gao Jinghua, Wu Hua, Wen Zhanqing, Zhuang Mingzhen, Feng Degui, Tan Zhiwen.</p>

"Forty-five" classes out of the entire school of "fifty-six" classes participated in the strike this time. Three classes, namely Political Science IV, Education IV, and History III, continued to attend classes, and the remaining six classes did not participate in the strike, but some students did not attend classes either.</p>

<p>[News from Central News Agency] A person in charge of a certain security agency in this city revealed to reporters yesterday that: since partial strikes occurred at Fudan University and Jiaotong University in this city, rumors have been circulating outside, or it is believed that "eventful May" is approaching and a full-scale student tidal wave cannot be avoided. The person in charge especially stated that the security authorities have long been thoroughly prepared to deal with this issue. According to reports, the communist bandits lurking in various colleges and universities in this city have been completely exposed by the authorities. However, in order to take care of the studies of the majority of good students, they are only secretly monitored during normal times, hoping that they will be safe and sound and know how to repent. Although they have repeatedly received reports from various parties recently, saying that the communist bandits will launch a "one school, one incident" movement on the student movement side, so as to create incidents and find excuses to instigate the trend, the authorities will take decisive measures against this when necessary, and continue to take the means to deal with the lurking communist bandits in the industrial circles of this city, in order to "clean up at once" to deal with the communist bandits' "one school, one incident" movement. It is hoped that the students of the city will give play to their conscience and not be induced and threatened by the communist bandits, and will not act blindly, and will abandon their studies. They are expected to seek progress in stability, and it is hoped that the parents of the students will also be able to restrain their children and seek stability and progress together.</p>

<h3 id="e138">Neighbor <a href="#e138" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c138" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">138</a></h3>
<p>— Hongjia</p>
<p>——A Record of Mr. Wang Zhuoyou</p>
<p>Only after becoming a neighbor with Mr. Wang Zhuoyou did my impression of him change.</p>
<p>He is a celebrity, teaching at two universities. His courses in ethics and sociology are the most popular among students. Needless to say, when a person becomes famous, he naturally becomes busy: on the street, we would often encounter a dilapidated rickshaw, carrying the rather prosperous-looking Mr. Wang Zhuoyou, being wearily pulled around by that emaciated rickshaw puller.</p>
<p>Once, a friend A hosted a dinner, and I had the opportunity to meet Mr. Wang Zhuoyou. Among the seven or eight guests at the table, he was the oldest, in his fifties, and his social status was relatively high, so everyone treated him as the center of the conversation. And he, indeed, did not disappoint as a knowledgeable elder, having deep and thorough insights into all kinds of complex social, political, and economic issues. Listening to his well-organized and reasoned speech, everyone would be moved and sincerely respect him.</p>
<p>As the dinner broke up, A specially patted my shoulder and said:</p>
<p>"Old X, you may as well often ask Mr. Wang for advice, you will definitely gain a lot of knowledge."</p>
<p>I nodded. Although it was the first time we met, I did indeed have a very good impression of Mr. Wang Zhuoyou.</p>
<p>I did not go to visit him. Because I felt that his work was very busy, it was not good to disturb him.</p>
<p>However, the opportunities to meet him or hear him speak in other places slowly increased, and we became acquaintances. When he sat in that rickshaw and walked down the street, as soon as he saw me, he would clasp his hands in front of him and bow to me. This kind of polite etiquette, although it inevitably made me feel constrained, did not affect my respectful attitude towards him.</p>
<p>After repeated contact, I learned that he was a Kropotkinist. He studied Kropotkin's theory very deeply. When he expounded the theory of mutual aid, explaining human love in a melodious tone, even those who were addicted to sensual pleasures would be moved.</p>
<p>I was very honored to have the opportunity to become his neighbor.</p>
<p>Originally, I was borrowing a room at a colleague's house. But this colleague's mother-in-law brought her recently graduated third daughter from the countryside to the city to take the school entrance exams. In this way, I had to move out of the room I was borrowing.</p>
<p>I was feeling anxious about this when A ran over to tell me that Mr. Wang Zhuoyou had recently had a room vacated by a tenant, and if I was willing to fill the space, it probably wouldn't be a problem.</p>
<p>The room was about ten feet square, and the lighting and location were not bad. What made me hesitate was that the rent was a bit expensive, five dou of rice a month. As a result of A's mediation, the deposit of two dan of rice was waived, and the rent was calculated at 80% of the market price of rice. For this, Mr. Wang Zhuoyou also expressed his deepest apologies to me, saying:</p>
<p>"This room was originally vacant, and it should have been given to you, brother. But, to be honest, it is not easy to find a house here. Even this dilapidated house, I don't know how many relatives and friends have come to me to negotiate. Now that I rent it to you, they still resent me! As for the rent, I charge five dou of rice per room here. Now I am giving you a little discount, which is a little gesture of mine. But," he suddenly emphasized his tone, "you must not let the other tenants know, otherwise, it will increase my troubles."</p>
<p>As he said this, he suddenly burst out laughing. After laughing for a while, he said with emotion:</p>
<p>"Life is not easy, ah, this old ox of mine is bearing a heavy load. Three children, one in university, two in high school. If it weren't for a little subsidy from the rent, I simply wouldn't be able to carry on. But, the rent can't be raised, what is five dou of rice worth at this moment?"</p>
<p>After becoming Mr. Wang Zhuoyou's tenant, the opportunity to get close to him did not increase. He was rarely at home during the day, and he did not easily come downstairs after returning home. Sometimes, when we met in the courtyard, he would as usual clasp his hands in front of him and bow, and often he would rush past before I could return the greeting.</p>
<p>There were a total of eight people in his family. All three sons boarded at school. Besides Mr. Wang Zhuoyou himself and his rickshaw puller, there was also his wife with the eel-like feet, a deaf old woman who was in charge of cooking, and an underdeveloped maid with a foolish-looking face. These three women were like ghosts, rarely hearing them speak all day long. However, as soon as Mr. Wang Zhuoyou returned home, the upstairs would start bustling. He often loudly scolded something, as if nothing was to his liking.</p>
<p>"Damn it! I..." That voice was no longer as beautiful and pleasant as when he was talking about mutual aid and human love, but became rough and cruel.</p>
<p>At first, this made me feel very strange and troubled, repeatedly asking myself: "Could that really be Mr. Wang Zhuoyou?" But slowly, I became used to it.</p>
<p>Once, after the second watch of the night, I was about to go to sleep when suddenly, there was a clanging sound, as if a cup had been smashed upstairs. —A moment of silence, followed by a storm:</p>
<p>"Damn it! You've lost your soul! A good foreign porcelain cup, you insist on breaking it! Huh, see if I dare to beat the skin off you!" Mr. Wang Zhuoyou's throat roared like a bamboo tube being split open.</p>
<p>"Ah!" a girl's panicked scream, followed by two crisp slaps.</p>
<p>"Heh heh heh..." The girl started to cry.</p>
<p>"You're still crying! I'm glad you're crying!" That voice was even more furious.</p>
<p>"Wah" a sound, followed by a few heavy "thump thump" sounds on the back, and a rush of chaotic footsteps, mixed with crying, ran out of the room. Only Mr. Wang Zhuoyou's loud throat vibrated in the silent night:</p>
<p>"See if I'll starve you tomorrow!"</p>
<p>What followed was a series of foul curses. I didn't want to listen anymore, and hurriedly covered my head with the quilt.</p>
<p>Four months later, due to the wise authorities' effective control, the price of rice suddenly became an untethered wild horse, rising ten times more than when I moved into Mr. Wang Zhuoyou's house. I really couldn't afford the rent of five dou of rice. Helplessly, I had to shamelessly ask him to reduce the rent. "This, this..." He frowned at me for the first time, and after hesitating for a moment, he said:</p>
<p>"This shouldn't be a problem, but I really can't carry on lately. Moreover, reducing your rent is a small matter, but how can I deal with the other tenants?"</p>
<p>The problem was not resolved, and he promised to consider it again.</p>
<p>Ten days later, his eel-footed wife suddenly paid a visit to my room. After talking east and west for a while, she finally explained her intention:</p>
<p>"The school is about to have summer vacation. Our children all want to come home, and there's no space in the house. Your husband is not an outsider, we want to take this room..."</p>
<p>I didn't wait for her to finish, and agreed to move out by the end of the month.</p>
<p>On the night before I moved, Mr. Wang Zhuoyou cordially invited me to eat at his house. Perhaps he had drunk too much wine, he seemed extremely excited, and endlessly talked about the old tunes of mutual aid, human love, and so on. Was he moved by his own words? The tears in his eyes sparkled under the electric light, but I didn't listen to a word. I would unconsciously look at the foolish girl who was serving us by our side, she listened blankly to her master's wise words, and occasionally peeked at him with a thief-like, timid gaze.</p>
<p>Now, I still often encounter Mr. Wang Zhuoyou. He is still so prosperous-looking, and that dilapidated rickshaw has also been repainted. But the rickshaw puller is even thinner, and even more exhausted when running. Naturally, he cannot help but clasp his hands in front of him and bow to me, and I, as usual, smile and nod. But in my heart, I really want to spit on him. (Written in Rong in April)</p>

<p>— Xu Zhimo's Posthumous Works, Compiled by Chen Congzhou</p>
<p>"Not envious nor demanding, nothing useless and not good." "Envy" means harm, jealousy. Wenzheng said, "There is no greater good than forgiveness, and no greater evil than jealousy." The jealous act like gossiping women, why bother comparing them. Those with high talent are never willing to bend, and those with arrogant temperament are never willing to submit to others. If they lack the effort of self-cultivation, at best, they will be full of thorns, perverse and complaining. In short, this is not the demeanor of a great man. A gentleman puts the country first and makes nurturing talents his career, selecting superior steeds from the mediocre and identifying jade from tiles. Those who are more virtuous than I, I will learn from them. Those who are more talented than I, I will respect them. One to achieve others, one to achieve oneself, this is the way to enjoy life and know destiny. Envy is the business of petty people, harming one's nature and wounding one's virtue, how can one win people over? Therefore, if one does not love oneself, then so be it. If one has the ambition to rule the world, then one should not envy those who precede him.</p>
<p>The Analects say, "A gentleman who is not serious will not be respected, and learning will not be firm." This does not mean to pretend to be dignified. Therefore, it is said to "be loyal and trustworthy." This is not self-isolation. Scholars should recognize the greatness of the world, and then see their own shortcomings. Knowing shortcomings leads to respect, respect gives rise to awe, awe of Heaven's will, awe of great men, awe of the words of the sage. Those who are in awe deliberate on their actions and naturally reach. The affairs of the world are so numerous that one cannot possibly exhaust even one or two of them. From this perspective, I am not as good as the carpenter. One should be careful internally and value oneself externally, and then know to seek practical and applicable learning.</p>
<p>Gordon said, "The nature of barbarians is without long-term consideration and greedy for profit. This is why their virtue is close to that of beasts." Try to close your eyes and seek within myself, how much does my virtue differ from that of the barbarians? Can one not be vigilant? Can one not be vigilant?</p>
<p>On the 29th, I read Mr. Rengong's "New People's Theory" and "Moral Education Mirror," and ten volumes were filed first. Joy, annoyance, shame, and emotion all came together at once. Just as Baoyu in "The Dream of the Red Chamber" recited the crab poem and said, "Mine should also be burned!" Now, when I read Mr. Rengong's text, I also say, "My disciple's should also be burned!" (Isn't that a bit frivolous!)</p>
<p>To know is to have innate knowledge, to act is to realize knowledge. Straightforward and delightful, I accept it! I embrace it!</p>

<p>Having painted with a single heart, given as a gift,</p>
<p>The shimmering light green does not require weeding.</p>
<p>Because the twin stems constantly condense dew,</p>
<p>Even more delighted by the spiritual root leading the phoenix chicks (The lady's third son, Lin, was able to paint at the age of eight).</p>
<p>Moved from a hidden valley, still dyed with mist,</p>

<p>Why bother using a yellow porcelain dipper to preserve the fragrance,</p>
<p>Ten steps of secluded elegance, like the female Meng Jian.</p>
<p>Xiang stems and Jian stamens claim to be fragrant,</p>
<p>Who recognizes the Ouji branch has an ancient fragrance (Ouji orchids are produced in Yongjia, and the Wen Hengshan poem says, "Cherish the spiritual root from Ouji East");</p>
<p>A hundred scrolls in Jiangnan show their beauty,</p>

<p>— Lü Baihua</p>
<p>Spring is already at its tail end. As a busy man, I naturally have no interest in seeking spring. Coincidentally, I need to return to my hometown in eastern Zhejiang, and Hangzhou is inevitably on the way. Allowing the scenery of the lake and mountains to cleanse my troubled mind would be an accidental and rare "fate," as they say.</p>
<p>Initially, I planned a trip to the Twin Peaks. The two peaks that stand facing north and south – along the North Peak area, only the secluded Feilai Peak is worth seeing. The scenery is too monotonous. The three Tianzhu temples are just a group of people worshipping the Yellow Cloth Bag, and feel even more monotonous. Just yellow temples and alluring incense smoke. Therefore, after comparing, I still prefer to go to the South Peak line. From the pillow facing the Qiantang River, the surrounding valleys are indeed worth exploring. This was also an introduction from Chen Zong'en, a friend in Hangzhou who is about to take office as the magistrate of Xuanping County, who took time out to guide me.</p>
<p>We departed from the lakeside, taking a public bus directly to Qinwang Mountain, visiting Gu Dunru, the dean of the College of Arts and Sciences in Zhijiang. He accompanied us to see the newly equipped architectural teaching materials and lathes, instruments, etc. We sat for a while in his self-titled Liuyun Pavilion, looking out at the flat-flowing river. Thinking of Qin Shihuang, who burned books and buried scholars, when he toured the east and climbed this mountain, Zong'en said to me, "Unexpectedly, thousands of years later, this place has become the highest institution of learning."</p>
<p>Descending Qinwang Mountain, we ran up the steps to the seventh floor of the Liuhe Pagoda. It is said that this is the story of King Qianzhen suppressing the tidal bore, but the monks in the temple stubbornly pointed out that this is a memorial to Su Qin and the Six Kingdoms. Perhaps it is the coincidence of the pagoda's name, coupled with the misinformation from the neighboring Wangshan? Afterwards, we called a car to Hupao.</p>
<p>Walking into Daci Temple through the dense pine forest, we saw a Hupao Spring. Because of the presence of solidified matter in the water, the tea brewed with it never overflows, even when it is full. Behind the tea seat is a steep mountain wall, with a stone tiger and a cave at the bottom, as if telling us that the mountain god has just emerged! This can be considered a supplement to the legend that a monk who once stayed there dreamt of a tiger running and obtaining the spring. In the past, on the dripping cliff, there was a poem carved by Ma Yifu, with the line "Po Lao inadvertently obtained a pinch," and a couplet inscribed by Master Ji Gong beside the Ji Gong Pagoda, which aroused my yearning.</p>
<p>Time was really too short, so we could only take a hurried look. We didn't have time to go to Yanxia Cave. After seeing the Floating Snail of the Sea in the Stone House Ancient Cave, we jumped on the return car. The shell-shaped cave reminded me of Shiyi Ji, which says:</p>
<p>"There is a large snail named Duobu, carrying its shell to travel; when it is cold, it returns to its shell. When a wise king appears in the world, it floats on the seashore."</p>
<p>It must be that the Duobu snail forgot its shell and was embedded here. Or perhaps this area was once part of the sea tail, which was cut off by the mischievous child of creation, turning into thousands of jagged rocks. The large snail floating on the seashore didn't have time to escape and became a palm-blowing disciple of the Tathagata. I deluded myself with this explanation, since there are plenty of myths between the Twin Peaks and the lake anyway. However, the floating snail should symbolize peace, but the current era is filled with the smoke of war.</p>

<p>— Zhao Jingshen</p>
<p>Ruskin's Love Letters</p>
<p>The British literary critic John Ruskin once pursued the beautiful young woman Effie Gray. Admiral Sir William James recently compiled a book, "Ruskin and Effie Gray," which collects many letters. Effie Gray eventually married Ruskin, but after six years of marriage, they divorced. Effie Gray "did not at all think that she had ever been Ruskin's wife."</p>
<p>Effie Gray</p>
<p>Ruskin did not want to marry a woman with whom he had no common interests. Perhaps their divorce was because his wife was a socially ambitious person?</p>
<p>This art critic wrote love letters to Effie when he was twenty-eight years old. The letters contained shy tenderness and the imagined marriage of a prospective son-in-law with a beautiful young woman. It seems that his technique surpassed his true feelings, and he was afraid of Effie's seduction.</p>
<p>He said in one letter: "I don't know how to compare you. You are like a sweet forest with a pleasant clearing. People wander there, go to the center, feel cold and cannot pass through. Effie, you are so hateful, but you don't know it yourself."</p>
<p>Another letter, which has been called "mature love," said: "My own Effie, my benevolent Effie, my mistress, my friend, my queen, my lover, my only love, how good you are, I cannot answer you a single word today. In half an hour, I have to go to town with my mother and there are many things to do, but I must first write a reply to you. I will never be jealous of you. I want to maintain a purer form of jealousy, desiring more love, within certain limits."</p>
<p>However, when he concentrated on his work, he would forget about love. "I am busy with architecture, and sometimes I almost completely forget everything about you." The same was true when he climbed to the top of a chapel or a mountain. "When I paint mountains, I forget myself and my wife."</p>
<p>William has six hundred and thirty-three letters, only one-third of which have been published. In addition to Ruskin and Effie, there are also letters from their parents and from Millais, Effie's husband in 1854.</p>
<p>Dreiser's Posthumous Work</p>
<p>Dreiser</p>
<p>Theodore Dreiser, the great American novelist, wanted to write a "Triology of Desire" during his lifetime. The first part, "The Financier," was published in 1912, and "The Titan" was published in 1914. These two books had a lasting impact on American novels, and many readers were waiting for the completion of the third part. Thirty years later, "The Stoic" was finally published. We can guess why he did not publish this book during his lifetime. He had worked hard on this book, with two or three endings, allowing his copyright-inheriting children to choose; but no matter how he revised it, he could not reach the level of the first two parts.</p>
<p>The first part is the most moving. "The Financier" integrates economics, politics, and love into one. The story itself and the climax are very attractive to readers. Frank Aigernon Couperwood's imprisonment had two reasons: one was public, he used municipal funds to gamble and lost; the other was secret, he seduced the daughter of Efward Malia Butier. Butier was one of the three political giants in Philadelphia, and this person is written most vividly in the trilogy, even more than the protagonist Couperwood.</p>
<p>The second part, "The Titan," alternates between writing about sex and wealth. The wealth part is better than the sex part.</p>
<p>If we check the "American Biographical Dictionary," we can find an entry about Charles Tyson Yerkes (1837-1905), and you can see how closely Dreiser's Couperwood matches Yerkes. Yerkes's life can also be divided into three parts. First, his adventures in Philadelphia, including imprisonment. The second piece of luck was when he sold the streets, and there were rumors outside about his divorce and remarriage. Later, he managed the Chicago street railway, followed by a bribery struggle.</p>
<p>The third part of Yerkes's trilogy was when he sold the street railway and got fifteen million dollars in stolen money. He went to London to try to control London's water pipes. His crimes were even greater than what Dreiser dared to say.</p>
<p>Just as he was about to achieve victory in wealth, he died of a serious illness. After his death, his wealth gradually dissipated. The free hospital he dreamed of was never built, and the art gallery he planned to build for New Yorkers was also auctioned off. The Chicago auction house went bankrupt hopelessly, and London's water pipes, which should have been his main memorial, were occupied by others after success.</p>
<p>Dreiser's third part was not very successful because the author did not know London well. He also could not write all of Yerkes's affairs. His successors will not correct even two or three historical errors in it.</p>

<h3 id="e143">Celebrating Festivals <a href="#e143" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c143" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">143</a></h3>
<p>— Nian Hong</p>
<p>People often have the habit of "borrowing in small amounts and repaying in full." What is owed bit by bit on ordinary days is repaid all at once during festivals. They are willing to rush around and become exhausted in a few days, but never think of paying attention at any time to avoid digging a well when they are already thirsty. Like garbage and dust in the corners of walls, they are reluctant to spend a little effort to sweep and wipe them every day, until the eve of the Lunar New Year, when they do a major cleaning, spending a whole day mobilizing the entire family, and perhaps still not able to clean everything up. The same is true for studying. If you usually put in effort, you don't need to stay up all night before exams, becoming exhausted, and still not getting good grades. This principle seems very simple, but getting rid of this bad habit is extremely difficult.</p>
<p>Perhaps the wise people of the past took this into consideration, knowing that people's "sporadic effort" mentality is not easy to eliminate, so they had to come up with the method of setting a certain day of a certain month as a certain festival, both to remind everyone not to forget this matter and to take this opportunity to repay what has been accumulated on weekdays. The intention was originally good. For example, to promote filial piety, they try to create a Father's Day and Mother's Day; to value the next generation, they set up a Children's Day and Youth Day, and so on. Gradually, there are more and more commemorative festivals on the calendar, such as 8/8, 9/9, 10/10, etc. All days that are easy to remember have been designated as some kind of memorial day.</p>
<p>As the March 8th Women's Day approaches, women begin to be noticed. Articles about improving women's rights can often be seen in the newspapers, and the several women's issues raised every year are being discussed extensively again. Then, it turns to the issue of youth prospects. As for children, they are even more the masters of the future, and children's welfare must not be neglected, because time has already progressed from March 8th to March 29th and April 4th. After April 4th, it will be the workers' day; and once Labor Day has passed, the labor problem seems to have been solved along with it, and everyone is enthusiastic about promoting the greatness and sublimity of maternal love. In June, there is often Poet's Day, and there is a special poetry issue in the literary supplement. Soon, a series of commemorations of the sacred War of Resistance and the arrival of the great victory begin. After National Day, this kind of intoxication and emotion gradually fades, people realize the passing of a year, and begin to prepare how to spend the annual Christmas and Lunar New Year's Eve. Naturally, the prostitution problem still has to be discussed, and children's health competitions still have to be held—when another Women's Day and Children's Day arrive.</p>
<p>After the sports meet, sports are considered to have been promoted. After the anti-tuberculosis week, it seems that tuberculosis has received a special medicine. After the traffic safety week, it is okay to ignore city tigers hurting people. After May Fourth, even if those who engage in literature starve to death, at most they only earn a sigh!</p>
<p>Important figures are busy all year round attending meetings and giving speeches. Revolutionary martyrs and heroes of the War of Resistance are only remembered at this time. The meaning of "festival" has long been blurred and unrecognizable, but every time there is a commemorative day, the grand occasion is unprecedented. Everyone discusses and studies enthusiastically, but what have they actually gained? Perhaps no one can answer.</p>
<h3 id="e144">Abolishing Jiao and Fen <a href="#e144" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c144" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">144</a></h3>
<p>— Hong Xian</p>
<p>I saw news in the newspaper that the banking industry has abolished jiao and fen in accounting. But in reality, aren't units like one yuan, ten yuan, and one hundred yuan also nominal? Try asking now to withdraw cash from the bank, and when encountering amounts less than a thousand yuan, how can they be seriously paid out? It would be better to simply omit units below a thousand yuan, which would be more practical.</p>
<p>It will also be more difficult for children to understand the units of currency in the future. They only know that banknotes of a thousand yuan or more are available. What are hundred-yuan and ten-yuan notes have long been forgotten. As for a few jiao and fen, they have become abstract things. This is truly a tragedy.</p>
<p>I remember last year in the countryside of Sichuan, an old lady took her savings of ten years' worth of two-jiao notes to buy meat. When she was refused, she stared blankly, at a loss. The newspaper published this as news. I only wonder whether future generations will look at today as we look at the past?</p>
<h3 id="e145">Spring Outing <a href="#e145" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c145" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">145</a></h3>
<p>— Tan Ke</p>
<p>Spring is about to pass! Apart from taking off my cotton robe and putting on a jacket, spring has no effect on me. The cement floor has not changed, and the sky is still the same. People living in the city are tired of the sound of car horns and have grown weary of the bustling crowds. They want to escape from their pigeon-coop-like homes and get close to nature. Their noses, blackened by coal smoke, also need to absorb some fresh air. It must be for these reasons that a large number of "Shanghainese" have poured out of "Oriental Paris" for the annual – what a lovely term! – spring outing. However, spring outings are still only for the lucky ones. I did not get this fortune. My planned spring outing, the destination is Hangzhou, the time is a week. The hope is a bit too extravagant, but I believe that "aiming high," may get somewhere, if Hangzhou cannot be visited or the stay is less than a week, the spring outing in principle can always be realized, unexpectedly, spring is about to pass, the spring outing looks like it is stillborn.</p>
<p>Friends in Hangzhou have repeatedly sent letters "urging me to come," first in a tempting way, saying how beautiful the spring in West Lake is, and that it is a pity to miss such a good spring. Later, they scolded me for not understanding the joys of life, saying that I was gloomy and indifferent to spring. Another friend from Guangdong also wrote to ask me if I had "toured" Hangzhou's "spring," asking me to send a few photos and write a report on my Hangzhou trip. He thought that with only a few hours of train travel between me and Hangzhou, going once a week would not be anything, but he did not know that things were not always so. Let me end with a saying from Mencius: Do I love cement floors and the smell of coal smoke? I am forced to.</p>

<p>— Oriental Dawn</p>
<p>One day, an old man walked into the editorial office of a Russian thought magazine. He was wearing a sheepskin coat, a fur hat, and holding a manuscript in his hand. The secretary took the manuscript from his hand; it was a novel written by a farmer named Semenov. The secretary told the old man to go back and come back in two weeks to hear the reply. On time, the old man came again. The secretary told him to wait there. At this time, two editors and a publisher were excitedly chatting and drinking red wine in the study. The secretary came in and announced that someone was waiting outside to hear the reply to the novel by the farmer Semenov. The literary editor of the magazine was a tall young man with beautiful hair, a bifurcated beard, and glasses:</p>
<p>"Yes, yes, I have already read it. Let him wait a while, I will go to see him right away."</p>
<p>However, that kind of excited conversation could not be interrupted, so time passed unknowingly. About an hour and a half later, the secretary appeared again at the door of the study.</p>
<p>"Mitofan Nilovich—that old man is still waiting outside!"</p>
<p>"Yes, yes, I will go to see him right away."</p>
<p>A lot more time passed, and the secretary urged him for the third time, and the editor finally found the manuscript and walked into the reception room.</p>
<p>"Where is that old man?"</p>
<p>The old man in the sheepskin coat stood up from the wooden chair. The editor walked over to him: "Are you the one who sent Semenov's manuscript last time? I have already read this novel..."</p>
<p>The editor raised his eyelids to look at the old man, and suddenly stopped his sentence. It turned out that standing in front of him was the famous Leo Nikolaevich Tolstoy. He had been sitting there quietly, waiting for more than two hours.</p>
<h3 id="e147">On Precedent <a href="#e147" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c147" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">147</a></h3>
<p>— Yu Longguan</p>
<p>Many things in society are unnecessarily hindered, with no way to develop and progress. "Precedent" can be said to be one of the reasons. I remember that the newspaper reported last time that university students requested full public funding, and the spokesperson of the Ministry of Education said: "There is no precedent abroad." This couldn't help but make people have some thoughts. I think it doesn't matter whether there is a precedent or not, and there is no need to take foreign countries as an example. It should be determined purely by the national finances. Just because other people have not stipulated it, we cannot implement it. Isn't this a joke! At the same time, I also feel too pitiful. Others have stipulated that every citizen must receive compulsory education, so why can't we universally implement it? If our country were also wealthy, we could have free admission to all universities, middle schools, and primary schools, so that everyone could have the opportunity to study, and the level of knowledge of the people would be higher than that of all countries in the world. Wouldn't that also be a good thing? Why does our country have to follow behind others in everything, unable to catch up and create a new style? The hearts of the people of our country are bound by the "precedent" trap, no wonder everything is affected.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the implementation of some affairs in institutions must also have a precedent in order to ensure that you do not make mistakes. People with considerable work experience and older people must always investigate cases and find out what the previous examples were. We dare not say that "precedent" has no value at all, but its essence is definitely not a treasure trove. Many past examples are not necessarily suitable for today's use, just like the entire history, it is to make people understand the past changes and their causes, so that they can learn to predict the future and use it as a reference for dealing with today's affairs. Using previous examples as a norm in everything can only at best achieve Xiao Gui Cao Sui, and this is still from a good perspective, it is impossible to surpass and stand out. If the example itself has problems, then the consequences are not difficult to imagine!</p>
<p>Everything has a beginning, a process, and an end. If everyone rigidly adheres to the rules and follows precedents, how can previous examples be created? Therefore, we can only use examples as a reference when encountering things, and cannot regard them as a golden rule, let alone limit our thinking within the scope of examples and restrict progress. We should create new and good examples in order to make progress every day. From major national policies to minor personal matters, it is all the same. We must try our best to break through the circle of "precedent" so that everything can move towards a new path.</p>

<p>— Zhang Yiqu</p>
<p>Fu Weng is good at painting orchids and is also skilled in calligraphy. He is known as the "Three Perfections" with his poetry. Recently, he held a solo exhibition in the Chinese Art Garden. I happened to go to see it and met him. After talking for a while, I felt that the person was like his orchids. His fame in the art world is definitely not accidental. It is difficult to appreciate art in a short time, chatting and walking ten steps to connect with fragrant orchids. His roots are beautiful and his essence is truly pure and flawless, leaving it for the world to look at with admiration.</p>
<p>His poetic talent is as famous as that of Du Fu, the subtlety of his calligraphy is like the Orchid Pavilion. More righteous is the monochrome brush in his studio, a faint fragrance in a spring breeze.</p>
<h3 id="e150">Poems Inscribed on Walls <a href="#e150" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c150" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">150</a></h3>
<p>— Fu Lu</p>
<p>In post pavilions and small temples, there are often excellent verses inscribed on the walls. These are mostly the works of travelers and women longing for their husbands, whose drifting lives across the world have filled their hearts with depression and sorrow. These are works of genuine emotion, unlike those who merely sing about the wind and moon. I once saw Xue Hong's occasional transcript in two volumes, which was extremely abundant in its collection. The author was probably someone who had spent half his life traveling north and south? Therefore, I have collected a few of those I have seen over the years:</p>
<p>Before the war, I traveled to Houhu in Nanjing and saw a poem inscribed on the wall of the Lake God Temple by someone named Huan Tian and Xu Linggong. It was subtle and lingering, like someone who had failed in the capital and was lonely. Huang Jigang once wrote a poem in the same rhyme. The poem said: Cherry blossoms have fallen, swallows have come, the water pavilion is swept clean of wartime dust, wind and clouds compete for the imperial aura in the northwest, guests and hosts welcome talented people in the southeast; the lake willows and lake mist are not weak water, mountain flowers and mountain birds lean against strong brushes, I have not followed Xu Yuan to the golden pass, but first followed the drifting tumbleweed to write seven laments.</p>
<p>Luotian Rock is in the southern suburbs of Yundu. Zhou Lianxi and Yue Wumu once traveled there, and the scenery is secluded and there is another world. In the early summer of the twenty-eighth year, my friend Liu Qingru happened to be the magistrate of this city and invited me to visit. I saw three ci poems inscribed on the wall by Ma Xinshi. The Bodhisattva Man said: I drink three cups of wine in the quiet night, tears drip like rain, looking north to the beacon smoke, the dust of the Hu is filling the sky. Pomegranate flowers are as red as blood, I dare not let my heart ripen, I sit old in Luotian Rock, with a crescent moon full of emotion. Su Zhongqing said: I am deeply afraid of wasting my youth in the dark, drizzle tells of tonight, Jiang Lang has his own colorful brush, don't use it to paint eyebrows. Full of emotion, showing off pride, writing complaints, just awake and drunk again, already tired and still singing, it is the most boring. Looking at Jiangnan said: Qingxia is a good summer, not seeing famous mountains, green trees and cool clouds迷远岫, Qing 衆 flowing water 遶明. Inquiring among the local people of Yundu, Song Yuehuan, I learned that Ma Jun had great ambitions when he was young and once rode his horse out of Hangu Pass. After ten years of wind and dust, he was depressed and could not achieve his ambitions. He returned home dejectedly and set up a school in the mountains at the Lianxi Temple to be a teacher for children, using the cup of wine to dispel the sadness in his chest, so it is appropriate that a cavity of depression overflowed in his voice.</p>
<p>Years ago, I drank in a restaurant in Changting and saw two seven-character poems inscribed on the wall, without the author's name. I guessed that he lived on the border of Fujian and Jiangxi, and had experienced turmoil since the late Ming Dynasty. Therefore, he made broad-minded arguments, and the style was very similar to Banqiao. The poem said: (1) Why must I build a hut in the mountain village? The heart is far away, and there is more ancient meaning. It is not a taboo to plant flowers in broken urns, wild vegetables are as delicious as meat, the winter hong loves to wear a yellow cotton coat, and the daytime sleep is peaceful with a white board door, spending all day lazy and sick, letting the world be dizzy and drunk. (2) Failed brushes and incomplete books are worthless, the true joy is found here, inviting two or three good friends, chanting four or five new poems, what harm is there in crossing the border, forgetting the Jin and Qin years in autumn,혼 충 completely I am, the sound is ancient and much uncultivated, not yet opened.</p>

<p>Webster, the author of the Webster's Dictionary, accidentally received a bad check, resulting in a lawsuit.</p>
<p>Oliver Goldsmith, the author of the famous novel "The Vicar of Wakefield," was also arrested for owing rent.</p>
<p>Balzac was a very famous novelist in France, but because he owed too much debt, he dared not open the door when he heard the doorbell.</p>
<p>King Charles II of England was also forced by debt to sell what is now known as Pennsylvania for only 75,000 yuan to William Penn.</p>
<p>In his youth, Lincoln made friends with a drunkard in a grocery store, and later that grocery store unfortunately went bankrupt and the drunkard died. All the creditors demanded payment from Lincoln. Lincoln was unwilling to flee and was willing to bear all the debts himself. After eleven years of struggle, he finally suffered for others and paid off all the debts along with interest.</p>
<p>Whistler was the most famous calligrapher in the United States, but he was also forced by debt to borrow money from friends everywhere and pawn his own works. As a result, old debts were not cleared, and new debts came again, making him unable to cope. He had no choice but to allow the creditors to take away any items in the house as collateral. When a creditor moved a bed or a chair from his home, he would draw a bed or a chair on the floor.</p>
<p>The Greek philosopher Socrates was a very smart man, but he was often so poor that he could not get enough to eat. When he was about to die from poison, he suddenly remembered that he had borrowed a rooster from someone and had not yet returned it. Therefore, his last words were to ask a closest friend to return the rooster debt on his behalf.</p>
<h3 id="e152">Exquisite Prose <a href="#e152" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c152" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">152</a></h3>
<p>— Wu Yong</p>
<p>In this world, there are few things that are completely perfect. Therefore, criticizing or opposing something is bound to win the approval and sympathy of the general public, and in fact, those criticisms are often correct. If you agree with or sympathize with something, it is difficult to put pen to paper, and you will inevitably be criticized and opposed. This is also true of book reviews. For a book that is not satisfactory, we can write a rather insightful review. For a profound work, it is quite difficult to write a satisfactory book review. In other words, bad books can produce good book reviews, while good books are not easy to inspire good book reviews. When Jin Shengtan of the Qing Dynasty reviewed "Talented Scholar" books such as Water Margin and Romance of the Western Chamber, he often only wrote "Wonderful," or "Wonderful, Wonderful," or "Wonderful indeed, Wonderful indeed," etc. This was because he only felt the exquisiteness of the writing, but could not immediately say where the exquisiteness lay. Yet, he could not bear not to praise it, so he had no choice but to blurt out a "Wonderful" first, and slowly ponder where the wonder lay. Ultimately, he could not figure it out, so he could only end with a "Wonderful."</p>

<p>The "Vice Presidential" election is particularly lively because of the large number of candidates. The political views of those celebrities, and the editorials in various newspapers, are all grand and voluminous, full of lofty theories and grand arguments. They are all great essays based on political or legal standpoints. As an old man, I can only admire them. I will tell a few stories for reference, in the spirit of a rustic offering humble fare.</p>
<p>Generally, the term "Vice" in ordinary titles often has two functions: (1) to assist; (2) to prepare. For example, in the old imperial examinations, there were always one Chief Examiner and one Vice Examiner in each province, except for the metropolitan examination. When entering the examination hall to grade the papers, they actually graded half each, sharing the workload equally. But nominally, the Chief Examiner was the main one, and the Vice Examiner was the assistant. If one of the two suddenly had an accident and could not perform his duties or was absent, then the other one would have to review and finalize the entire list of successful candidates, bearing the entire responsibility. Therefore, at least two people had to be selected, not just to help, but also "to prepare for the unexpected." If the Chief Examiner was absent, the Vice Examiner would take charge of the whole situation. If the Vice Examiner was absent, the Chief Examiner would take charge of the whole situation. Each had a portion of the real power in grading the papers, and the preparation was a mutual function. Therefore, the interpretation of "Vice" is very flexible, but in fact, the "preparation" component is greater.</p>
<p>In a democratic country, next to the President is the Vice President. The difference between him and the Vice Examiner in the imperial examination is that he does not usually participate in the President's affairs, but if the President is absent, he immediately succeeds him and exercises great power. (Truman's succession to Roosevelt to complete the victory is a clear example of "once power is in hand, one will issue orders.") Therefore, the so-called "Vice" is more of a "preparation" function, and its significance is quite significant.</p>
<p>In the early years of the Republic of China, after Li Huangpi was elected Vice President, he issued a telegram, using elegant language to express his humble feelings, which included the phrase "Yuan Hong is prepared to serve as the heir apparent." It is said that this was the work of Secretary-General Rao Hanxiang, who was imitating the wording used for the crown prince in previous dynasties. In ancient times, the crown prince was called the "heir apparent," so some short articles in the newspapers deliberately used humorous language, saying that Li Huangpi was regarding himself as the crown prince, and what place was Yuan Keding to be put in? It seems like a joke, but in fact, "heir apparent" originally meant preparation. The crown prince's preparation to inherit the throne is in principle the same as the vice president's preparation to take over the presidency. Using established phrases, simply saying "heir apparent," is not too offensive. (The term "heir apparent" is also another name for the crown prince, but avoiding the word "emperor" is not very jarring, and taking it out of context is not unacceptable.)</p>
<p>Although the American Vice President has no real power, his role is extremely important. Moreover, China's "rule of law" is still in its infancy, and the situation is different from that of the United States. The preparation of "people" is even more indispensable. Therefore, is it not right that the Vice Presidential election is causing a stir far and wide, and is being watched by all eyes?</p>

<p>— Qian Dacheng</p>
<p>When Fan Bozi (a contemporary figure) of Nantong helped Qian Jisun who was in "literary confinement," it caused controversy among the literati in Nantong. Bozi's tenth daughter married Chen Sanzi, whose poetry was lean, stiff, and divinely inspired, also imitating Huang Shangu, and was indeed a master of his time. When a county established a public education center in the Confucius Temple, Bozi wrote a couplet for it: "Teaching without discrimination; Culture lies here." The collected phrases were seamless, and the context was also appropriate.</p>
