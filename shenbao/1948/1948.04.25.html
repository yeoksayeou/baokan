<p>李宗仁挾着昨天戰勝的餘威，帶着勝利而又含有緊張心情的微笑；老早的就和夫人郭德潔來到了會塲。他掛着政府長官的紅條，仍然和昨天一樣，九點鐘就站在大會堂的門前，和代表們一個個的握手，郭德潔在門內站立着，每一個代表來時，幾乎都逃不過她的視綫，馬上就接着熱烈的握手。今天她顯得比以前更高興樂觀了：「請帮忙！帮忙！帮忙！」的聲音，不絕的從她的口中發出來，遇見熟識的代表時，就親切的拍着肩膀，連連的喊着：「心照！心照！心照不宣啊！」一個代表報功似的對她說：「我昨天投的李先生，今天還是投李先生。」她馬上又說：「還有兩關啊，請　續帮忙」！翁文灝入塲時，也被她拉着問：「你的良心投誰一票」？翁也笑着答復：「我投良心的一票」。</p>
<p>賢內助幫忙拉票</p>
<p>孫夫人陳淑英女士也站在會堂的門內，馬超俊夫人沈慧蓮同她緊站在一起，都是笑容可掬的和代表們親切的打招呼，孫夫人平常雖然不似李夫人那樣的活躍而善於詞令。但今夭也顯得特別的給予人以好感，她和馬夫人站在李夫人的前面，每一代表都是先和她們握手後，再走到李夫人的面前。馬夫人打趣着說：「我是來請客的，我要請熟朋友們去遊中山陵和玄武湖」。</p>
<p>程潛沒有李宗仁和孫科　的有賢內助在門口替他拉票，但仍然誠懇熱烈的在會塲內和代表們　　，他穿的還是那一件舊的黑西服。由於他的誠懇和忠厚的感人，昨天他已出乎一般人意外得到了第三的名次，今天仍是盡他最後的努力。</p>
<p>會塲內的空氣是那麽的緊張，但投票技術經過一次兩次的改進，今天的情形比昨天要要進步，大會秘書處事前週密的部署，使得今天投票的時間比昨天减少十五分鐘，開票也比昨天幾乎快了一小時，一時十分複選的結果就已呈現在代表們的面前了。</p>
<p>于莫徐民主作風</p>
<p>投票時在緊張中也有特別感人的一幕，昨天初賽時落選的于右任，徐傅霖，莫德惠三候選人，今天都來參加大會光榮的投他們神聖的一票；雖然今天的三位都是他們昨天的敵人，但經過了初賽後，于·莫·徐三先生都尊重選民的選擇，今天都把自己的票投了以前的競選敵人。當于右任等把票子投入票匭的時候，代表們都用熱烈的掌聲表示他們對於于等民主作風的敬意，攝影記者也都爭着獵取了寶貴的鏡頭。</p>
<p>開票的一小時四十分鐘內，會塲內是始終籠罩着緊張的空氣，一陣一陣的掌聲裏，不知引起了會塲內代表的多少喜怒哀樂的表情，唱票的聲　震盪着兩千多位代表的心弦，每個人都感覺沉重的空氣壓力的難以負祖。在複賽結果公佈的時候，李宗仁又以一千一百六十三票的多數，壓倒了孫程而居於首位，但明天在他們還要經過一次的交鋒，才可以再淘汰一人或者直接產生副總統。今天開票的過程中，十二票匭的票數也佈成了一個緊張的次序：第一票匭李宗仁以九十四票領先，接着一連到第五票匭都是李居首位，在五個票匭的總和中，李·孫·程的比例是四六三對三七〇對三二一，相差不算是懸殊。第六票匭開票的結果，孫科以一百九十票的多數，超過了李宗仁的一二一票，但李之總和爲五百八十四票，仍超過孫科五百六十票的總和而保特第一，程潛此時已較李孫少一百五十票以上。第七票匭程·李·孫平分秋色，第八匭孫科與李宗仁以九十九對三十九的比例，孫第一次獲得了總和的首席，但緊接着在第九匭時，李又急起直追，以一二三的多數，再奪回了　頭，第十匭李的氣燄益盛，以一七〇的絕對多數，迭成了九七四的紀錄。孫此時則僅八四二票，程潛自第七匭起頽勢已成，至此則已無可挽回，他這時僅及五百二十六的數目，到全部票子開完後，李以一一六三佔先，孫則只九四五，程則只六一六，今天只是複賽的結果，到底鹿死誰手，只有看明天或後天了。（四月廿四日於南京）</p>

<h3>星期論壇　科學與人生</h3>
<p>— 陳安仁</p>
<p>科學的人生觀，和科學與人生之關係，其含義不同；前者是科學上，表見人生的觀念；後渚則說明科學與人生的關係。前者是科學上說明人生的理想；後者是從科學影響於人生的事功上指示其動向。兩方面的注重點不同，但依舊是互有關　的。請把它互相關連的地方，分別闡述如下：</p>
<p>（甲）科學是掃除人生的障碍與痛苦　原始時代，人類心理幼稚，對於宇宙自然之事物，常不免驚奇與恐怖，而即以用迷信及畏神的心理，代替事物一切之理解。在此時代，其思想行動，供不易走上科學的道路。其稍爲進化的，則以自然界人事界種種的障碍與痛苦，就要設法加以掃除了。如「布須受」及非洲中部的「矮民」，會製造毒箭以自衛，伊羅葛人會蓋樹皮屋，埃斯基摩人會造雪屋，英屬哥林比亞人會建地下屋，皆所以减輕自然寒冷之痛苦，而各種交通工具，這時候也逐漸發明，如美洲印第安人之牛皮艇，西北部之大獨木舟，埃斯基麼人之豹皮艇，澳洲之組製樹皮艇等是。大凡人類的知識愈進步，則其利用科學常識以克服天然界的痛苦與障碍者愈多。例如天空之中，本不能自由往來，自氣學進步，飛機飛艇相繼發明，而雲漢之中，便可以遨遊自在了，又海底氣息窒塞，人類本不能生存，自有潛艇之發明，而茫茫大海，亦可以出沒停留於其間了。人生與憂患俱來，現在雖還沒有根絕痛苦之方法，旦相對地加以减少，則並不是難以做到之事。人生歷程中最　　之事，無過於病與死。這疾病與死亡，確是無法避免之事，但自科學進步，醫　進步，疾病之痛苦，便逐步减少，人生的壽命，也逐漸加長了。現代科學家對於心臟的跳動停止，可注射樟腦，以防其機體的崩潰。溫特斯坦氏對於已經殺死三小時之動物，用含有副腎素鹽溶液，以刺激其心臟，居然得吿復活。可知生命的回復與延長，可隨科學之進步，而逐漸形之於事實。</p>
<p>（乙）科學是增進人生之快樂與幸福科學愈進步，則人生之快樂與幸福亦愈增進，這可以從多方面說明之。如衣食住行種種設備，均隨科學之發達而愈見完備，人類之壽命，又以享受舒適而日見增加。就歐美人言，美國當一九二〇年時，其平均壽命，爲五十三歲，到一九二六年，增加五歲爲五十八歲，又據柏林聯邦統計局的計算，一七五〇年時德人的平均壽命爲四十歲，到一九一〇年爲五十歲，一九二〇年竟增至六十歲，這顯然是醫藥進步，享受舒適的功效，此其一。許多人以爲科學只能給人類以物質上之快樂，未必能給人類以精神之快樂，這也不然。因爲物質上之快樂，常可增加到精神上之愉快。譬如由桂林步行至重慶，約要三十天，如坐飛機，三小時就可到了。此其二。威爾杜倫給悲觀主義者的信裏，曾說：「你們的世代，曾經歷過去的大戰，即此大戰，使你們的任何方面，管改變了。你們看見百餘種殺人的武器，先後發明，又看見許多次國際間的慘殺，次第降臨；國與國在表面上雖用外交換文解決困難，但其實質皆屬帝國侵略與商業競參之盡情表露，你們目擊此種狀况，當然不能相信任何方式的烏托邦。」可是科學能製造殺人利器，也何嘗不可製法利人利器，正義申張，世界大同，以上所說各種悲劇，未嘗不可以避免，科學對於人類的恩賜，豈可限量？</p>
<p>（丙）科學是表現人類之生命價値　哲學宗敎倫理道德與科學，並非不相爲謀，而是互相爲用的。世多以爲這精神上之生命價値，當求之於理學哲學宗敎道德倫理方面之修養，而不能求之於科學，殊不盡然。釋迦基督與孔子，同以救世的宏願，己立立人，己達達人，其以宗敎倫理道德樹百代之典型，其精神固當永垂不朽，至若科學家之於科學，除了造福人類，衣被蒼生而外，其人格之崇高，與學業之精卓，亦每每可以廉頑立懦，激發人之志氣。</p>
<p>（丁）科學是指導人生之前程　科學包涵兩方面，即方法與精神。科學方法在求知，科學精神在求信。知爲行之本，行爲知之用。不知不足以言行，故求知即所以助行，而求信則所以求眞。眞爲信之本，不眞即不誠。因爲科學不是玄學，事事務求其知，務求其行，務求其實，務求其信。人生之前程，惟有建立於這知行誠信的基礎之上，而後確乎不拔，卓然可以自立。昔達爾文在劍橋大學時，歷時愈久，其探討自然科學的興趣愈濃。一八三一年後，從北威尼斯考察回來，以研究地質學的興趣，決意航行南美，測量地形。他在皇家軍艦比格爾號，經　六年之生活，對於動物學植物學地質學等各方面，都有精深的研究。後來在科學上哲學上樹立偉大的功績，就是在這時候立下基礎的，這是科學指導人生的一個。</p>
<p>就　　言，科學陽建立世界人類最高之理想，而就　　　，亦是建立人生最高之理想。因為它的宗旨，是在建立真善美之世界的，所以非與宗敎哲學倫理道德諸科，同流合作先建立眞善美之人生不可。人類最高的理想，是世界人道主義的扶植，是世界大同思想的實現，是世界永久和平機構的組織，是人類博愛精神的發揚。其途徑則爲世界文化之統一，技術之促進，學術之溝通，思想之聯繫，文字之一致宗敎之融通，敎育之　　　與物資之交流。這些工作，無一不靠賴科學的發展，只　　　權主義，帝國主義，侵略主義，　武主義，軍閥主　，封建主義，一槪排除凈盡，則科學之於世界，有利無弊，貢獻至鉅。洛芝於一八八九年之演講詞中說及：「現在是自然科學突飛猛進的時期，幾個月幾星期以前，發現的一串小波，現在却合一個極大的波。在這波峯上，我們可以看出未來的一種偉大的包羅一切的理論。」只因廿世紀以前之利學，與一切卑劣之思想混在一起，所以造成世界的大禍。痛定思痛，這時代應該可以過去了。此後的下半紀，如果革面洗心，大家願意踏進人類復興的新時代，仍非仰仗科學不可，科學到底是世界人類最高理想的工具。</p>

<h3>兩萬呎高空　七小時飛行　探測積石山</h3>
<p>— 本報特派記者　洪絮才</p>
<p>〔本報香港廿三日航訊〕積石山是不是可能超過喜馬拉雅山而成爲世界最高峯？這個謎是在雷諾的原子筆走私入口之後，逐漸喧騰起來的。當積石山的傳說越來越普遍的時候，雷諾的原子筆銷路也就越來越廣了。而正當人們對積石山之謎，發生濃厚興趣的時候，雷諾却偷偸地溜走了，留下的將是洗不淸的羞恥！</p>
<p>中央航空公司副　陳文寬表示：他曾經好幾次飛越積石山，憑着經驗，探測它的高度決無超過額非爾士峯的可能。爲求證實起見，特撥專機，招待上海新聞記者前往實地勘測。</p>
<p>專機是本月十五日由上海起飛，隨行者有中外記者十八人。沿途會在漢口，西安降落加油外，當晚直抵蘭州。央航公司招待在西北大厦留宿，那是當地最好的招待所。第二天早晨四點半鐘一輛團體客車把我們載到機塲去，沿途黄沙，紅牆，牛車，羊羣，在晨光熹微中，我們飽覽了西北風光。</p>
<p>專機早就準備就緒了，但是我欲　登時，副機師鄭世杰意外地阻止了我，他笑着吿訴我，還要上一課「跳傘速成班」，才有資格飛高空。我心裏砰然一跳，眼見小工正把降落傘從飛機上背下來。傘上厚積的塵埃吿訴我，降落傘並不是輕易應用的，我眞沒有想到，測量積石山會潛伏着這樣嚴重的危機。</p>
<p>陳文寬以自己爲模樣先行試穿，然後呌大家學着穿用。我提起那又笨又重的降落傘正在手足無措的時候，陳文寬跑來了，他幫着我把傘穿上了，指指腰際鋼精的拉手，有條理地敎着我：「你一定要在跳出機身之後幾秒鐘內，用力朝上拉，傘就會迅速撑開了。最初幾秒鐘，誰都難免要昏迷的，但刹時就會淸醒過來，那時候，你就應該自己作主，看看四周，不要讓人家和你碰撞，要朝東時，可拉東面的繩　，朝西時則拉西面的，要避免讓自己掉在河裏，設法跳在平地上……。你現在明白了馬？</p>
<p>當我看到旁人把傘背到身上專心練習試用，並且把各自名字寫上降落傘的時候，我深深領悟到事態的嚴重性。說眞話，當時我眞想臨陣脫逃，後來仔細一想，自己出發前的那種天不怕地不怕的神氣，就像自己是個英雄好漢，若結果如此下塲，竟至抱頭而竄，豈非是雷諾醜劇的重演？於是，我決定鼓起勇氣來，決不讓自己坍台專機自蘭州飛向甘肅靑海交界的山脈區，從機上下瞰，盡是些飛不完的土山，那綜褐色的山巒，此起彼伏，層出不窮。綯摸飛了一小時，眼前豁然開朗，但見一片冰雪，銀光耀目，這就是我們的目的地積石山了。</p>
<p>這時候機身漸漸上昇，當高度表指在一萬八千呎的時候，大家都開始感到窒息難受了。專機中的氧氧設備早就裝就，那東西就活像是防毒面具一樣，套住嘴鼻，一面和氧氣桶接通。因爲從來沒有使用氧氣的經驗，我老覺得這橡皮的面罩靠不住，就怕氧氣在沒吸入之前就會逃走一樣，我使勁地把橡皮面罩緊緊地壓住鼻子，竟而把兩頰都擦破了。。</p>
<p>當飛機漸漸上昇到二萬呎以上時，我開始感到支持不住了，但是我還是不願把視綫離開目的物。展開眼前的，只是白茫茫的一片，極目無際。眞好像世界就是積石山，或者說是我們進入了另一個世界。那裏面看不到一個人一棵樹草木不生，鳥獸絕跡，除了天，就是山，那終年積雪的山巓，一座又一座，好像永遠不會完。我不知道飛機是什麼時候離開那境地的，因爲當機身昇到二萬一千呎的時候，我頭暈目眩，感到一陣說不出的難受，那確是有生以來所未嘗領受的。我再也沒法充「硬好漢」了，只得在機中躺了下來，動彈不得</p>
<p>那天氣候並不理想，雲深風猛，飛機騰入高空時，顚動頗烈，那滋味委實不好受。我偶爾抬起頭來看看，許多鐵靑的臉，發紫的唇，和那些嘔吐的聲音，我那時想，幸而躺下的不止是我一個，否則總難免給人家一種「娘兒們畢竟不行」的印象。</p>
<p>從這些高空飛行看來，感覺得美人的體格，確勝我一籌　我看到那生活雜誌，紐約時報，及米高梅公司等的記者，自始至終在機上活躍，跳東跳西攝取鏡頭。我最恨生活雜誌的那個攝影記者，偏挑中了我在動彈不得的時候，把鏡頭對準了我的那副醜相。我明白他之所以這樣做，一定是想拿我這副半死的情形，來襯託他的强壯和了不起。我愈想愈氣，把大衣蒙住了頭</p>
<p>我昏昏沉沉地悶睡了有多少時間，自己也說不出來，反正當我淸醒過來的時候，機中已燃亮了電燈。同伴吿訴我：我們已飛向歸途。陳文寬曾由駕駛室出來，拿着地圖吿訴大家，他已經飛遍了整個積石山區，不斷地用雷達測量山峯的高度，但是沒有一座山是超過二萬呎以上的。</p>
<p>我從窗洞望出去，四周一片漆黑，看看錶，時針正指着七時四十分。想起按照預算，估計四五小時即可回返，現在飛了將近七小時，而且天色已黑，大家不免有點緊張起來了。坐在我旁邊的同業輕輕地對我說：「蘭州沒有夜航設備，且機塲四面多山，若是盲目降落，那是太危險了！」</p>
<p>經他這麼一說，我當眞覺得駭怕起來。而且正在這時候，原來一直開着的駕駛室的那道門，突然由電報聯絡員加以關上了。於是情勢更形危急了，大家用皮帶緊緊地把自己縛在座位上。有許多人還搶着坐連於機門的位子好像飛機馬上就要肇禍，他可以先行自機門處跳出似的。</p>
<p>飛機終於飛達蘭州上空，它在低空盤旋了好幾個圈子，這時候機中人的神情的緊張是可以想像得到的。但是專機終於平安地在跑道上降落，額手慶幸之餘，大家不得不對陳文寬駕駛的熟練，加以稱頌。</p>
<p>這樣，我飛越了積石山，正像陳文寬事後所說的：高空飛行七小時，決不是一件平凡的事。能够領受這種經驗，也許是生平値得紀念的。</p>

<h3>馬歇爾自哥京趕返華府　處理外交重大問題　應付聖地局勢已刻不容緩</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕舊金山廿四日廣播：馬歇爾今日返抵華盛頓後語記者稱，關于波哥大會議，大多數基本問題，均已獲致協議。馬卿返華府後，立即與其顧問商討世界重要問題。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕舊金山廿四日廣播：國務卿馬歇爾昨自哥京乘機兼程返國，已於今晨九時抵華盛頓。據稱，此次突然返華府，係因有「特別重要事件」，待其處理。</p>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓廿四日電〕國務卿馬歇爾將於今日返抵華盛頓處理要公。馬氏雖未明言此項要公爲何，據官方指出，馬氏抵此時，至少有四大政策問題待其決定。馬氏今日返國，非爲應付任何危機，而爲處理三月廿八日離開華府後積壓之問題，其重要者如下：（一）聯合國執行巴勒斯坦猶阿停戰，設立託管政府，及可能派遺國際保安隊至聖地問題。此事恐未能及時進行，防止五月十五日英國結束委治後巴勒斯坦戰事之擴大。（二）美政府將決定如何以軍事援助給與計劃中之西歐聯盟。杜魯門總統曾於星期四招待記者，宣布對此項重大外交政策之發展，不久將有聲明發表。（三）柏林局勢依然岌岌可慮，在西方國家與蘇聯之關係中，仍爲一糾紛最多之區。（四）蘇聯對於義大利共黨選舉失敗之可能反應。</p>
<p>〔合衆社巴拿馬運河區巴爾布廿四日電〕馬　爾　日自波哥大返華府途中，秘密飛抵此間亞爾布祿空軍基地，在未離該地續飛華府前，曾與加里比安防區司令克丹貝格中將作兩小時之密談。據消息靈通方面稱，馬卿之不待泛美會議結束而據離哥京，並非表示世界事件有若何嚴重之新危機，僅有若干重要外交政策需馬卿之裁決而已。且該會之主要工作業已完成，馬卿亦認爲母需久覊於此也。按泛美會議正在加緊討論各項重大項目，一星期後即可閉幕。</p>
<h3>執行巴勒斯坦托管　美邀我軍隊參加　安理會設停戰會監督聖地停戰</h3>
<p>〔中央社成功湖廿三日合衆電〕中國人士方面透露，中國正與美國談判關於可能利用中國軍隊以執行聯合國對巴勒斯坦之託管。據稱，中國迄今尙未拒絕美國之要求，如中國決定以軍隊供聖地警衛之用，亦僅能與美國曁其他國家之軍隊共同前往，美國現與中國進行之談判，與其與聯合國其他各國進行者同。</p>
<p>高級中國人士稱：渠等尙朱使中國受何約束，渠等復透露對於美國之請求中國所感困難者，厥爲在其剿共戰爭中，不能抽兵出國。各方漸信英國正準備與美國一致執行託管，但法國則將拒絕美國之建議。聯合國對巴勒斯坦問題之公開討論，已陷停頓，問題之每一重要面，皆在秘密處理中。聯合國大會政治安全委會已暫行休會，予各代表以硏究法國之建議案，法國建議採緊急步驟以保護耶路撒冷，免遭阿猶戰爭之殃及。</p>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓廿三日電〕據非正式但可靠方面廿三日息，如聯合國需要會員國協力警衛巴勒斯坦，美國最可能供給海軍陸戰一師，計一萬七千人，另加若干海軍船隻。</p>
<p>〔合衆社成功湖廿三日電〕英代表瓊斯廿三日在聯合國大會之政治委員會發言，對美國要求英國派兵執行巴勒斯坦託管事避免直接答覆，但稱，美國之託管建戰當予以「考慮」。英方發言人同時承認英美兩國之談判，仍在繼續中，英內閣仍在討論給予美國派兵要求之最後答覆。</p>
<p>〔聯合社成功湖廿三日電〕聯合國安理會今夜通過美國提案，決定設立三國代表團組成監督巴勒斯坦停戰委會。該代表團將由美，法，比駐耶路撒冷領事組成，以便立即着手工作。決議案以八對零票通過，蘇聯，哥倫比亞與烏克蘭棄權。蘇聯與烏克蘭攻擊美國此舉無非欲推翻巴勒斯坦分治計劃。蘇代表葛羅米柯稱，「美國惟恐巴勒斯坦不亂，停戰欲求成功，惟有停止日常進行之詭計。」但蘇聯並未行使否決權。先是英代表瓊斯在聯大政委會中稱，聖地之衝突已擴大爲公開戰爭，若不制止，或將危及世界和平。美國此刻應放棄最後解決辦法，而由聯合國集中全力，防止戰亂擴大。美代表奧斯汀爰在安理會有所提議。</p>
<h3>聯大會中止辯論　巴勒斯坦問題</h3>
<p>明起討論法國建議</p>
<p>中央社成功湖廿三日電〕聯大今同意中止巴勒斯坦問題之一般辯論，先行考慮法國之建議，後者主張以緊急措施，保護耶路撒冷城垣及居民。主席蔣廷黻宣佈大會政治委會即將於廿六日考慮法國之建議，並將巴勒斯坦問題之一般辯論暫時全部擱置。美澳代表均曾於法國之前提出議案，唯現均同意予法國建議以優先權。法於建議草案中，僅主張大會囑令託管理事會（與託管國及有關各方磋商）就保護耶路撒冷問題進行研究，並採取適當之措置。僉信法國所求者，爲組織國際志願警察隊下在託管理事會管制之下，於耶路撒冷服役，此議似將招致蘇聯之反對，因蘇聯迄今仍拒絕參加託管理事會也。蘇聯代表今已通知大會謂，在廿六日之會中，將對法國建議發表意見。</p>
<h3>法不擬參加</h3>
<p>〔路透社巴黎廿三日電〕消息畫通方面稱：法國政府殊不欲參預聯合國主持下巴勒斯坦之共同管制，法國在中東將持中立態度，以免引起法屬北菲回敎人民之反感。</p>

<h3>買氣若斷若續　華股形勢飄忽</h3>
<p>華股昨買氣雖不斷發生，但僅屬紗布證券等多方加碼而已，力量有限，漲來十分飄忽。永紗在二千元大關內外徘徊而已，餘股僅屬穩健。</p>
<p>晨開時承前收餘氣，永紗開高至二〇二〇元，開後外匯牌價未動，退至一九七五元，七六號等趁低進至二〇〇〇元，八九號等又賣到一九七五元，一四九號等來買，圈外刺激加强，人心一振，升至二〇三〇元，代辦費開一八元及二一元，形勢轉盤。五六號等賣到二〇一〇元，六九號等進至二〇三〇元，一三五號等賣出，十一時半，浮多恐慌，退至一九八五元。一八三號等來維持，升爲二〇一〇元，一五七號等仍售，午收爲二〇〇〇元。較前收計中法統益平平，永紗永公華新榮豐大通火柴麗安中絲永業商務新華閘北微升，信誼信和勤興景綸國貨微降。中泥已多日未獲成交，軋跌一成，塲外各未上市股票，尙形平庸。</p>
<p>公債　昨呆滯而小秀，成交約四百萬，統丙不過四千元上落，自一〇萬七開後，低價一〇萬六，收市時在一〇萬九左右掙扎。較前收計各債微漲二三千元。</p>
<p>外股　昨以業外刺激加重，港電報縮至七角七，怡紗晨開二八四萬，見二九四萬，英聯達三五〇萬高價而後稍回。證券帮賣出，洋行帮及廣帮吸收，結果較前收計怡紗會德豐業廣紙版怡　微升，英聯航業鋼業漲半成弱。</p>
<h3>紡織工廠南遷　後果頗堪重視</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕國內工業最近紛紛南遷香港，各方倍加關注。昨據某權威經濟專家意見，認爲遷港工業，以棉紡業於國民經濟關係最巨。據吿：自去夏迄今，香港新設之棉紡工廠，已有六家。全部錠子，達十二萬枚。資本總額，達港幣一億一千萬元左右。除南洋一家，係中英合資外，其餘皆華人資本。最近尙有二家，在籌設中。如此巨額資金，流赴香港，助長港匯緊縮，勢所必然。此項紗廠，每月可產紗七千二百件，足够香港針織業及織布業之需。將來擴展，尙可在南洋銷售。故香港棉紡業發展後，吾國紗布外銷，將大受影饗。外匯收入，勢必减少。一面國內棉紗產量减低，紗價更難抑平。瞻顧前途，殊可憂慮，深望政府注意。又據吿：香港原棉供給，來目印度。當地工資，亦甚昂貴，實非發展棉紡業之環境，必難維持永久。此刻各工業遷港，旨在逃避國內管制。不知國內採行管制，乃以外匯及物資缺乏，不得不然。今資本逃避，使外匯與物資更形缺乏，實不値得同情云。</p>
<p>〔本報南京廿四日電〕上海工廠因輸入管制以來，原料供應困難，而電力供應時斷時續，加之物價高漲，生活指數增加，故多數工廠有計劃遷移香港之說。據經部負責人稱：此種風說，本部亦有所聞，但爲數似不甚多。其實際情形如何，本部正密切調査注意中。如果遷港之工廠增多，則資金外流，生產减少，工人失業，我國工業目將蒙受不良影響。各廠之遷港原因，固有多種，而限額外匯之不易取得，實爲其中最主要者。關於解救廠家所受困難，本部向極注意，惟限額外匯之分配，如能設法改善，則困難自較易克服。</p>
<h3>勤興增資</h3>
<p>該廠於四月四日股東臨時會　　　　辦法，送二認三，即每一老股認繳現金三十元，可得五股，連原有一股，共得六股。査該廠原有資本一百卅四億四千萬元，新增六百七十二億元，合成總額八百零六億四千萬元。</p>
<h3>中行股東總會　改選商股董事</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕中國銀行昨下午三時假該行四樓會議室舉行第廿四届通常股東總會。董事長孔祥熙以在美不克來會主持，由該行總經理宋漢章代任主席。到各股東百餘人，首由宋總經理代讀孔董事長致股東總會之報吿書，後即報吿該行卅六年份營業狀况，旋由常駐監察人劉攻蓋報吿卅六年份決算案及盈餘分配案。最後改選商股董事，結果孔祥熙，宋子文，宋漢章，張公權，杜月笙，貝淞蓀，莫德惠，李馥蓀，陳輝德，卞壽孫，徐寄廎，金潤泉等十二人當選至五時始吿散會。</p>
<h3>輪廣處又訂兩種　處理基準原則</h3>
<p>轍出入管理委員會輸出推廣處，自先後公佈「輸出品所需包裝材料特許轍入辦法，」與「輸出品製造原料輸入辦法」以來，各出口商依照各該項辦法前往申請者，頗爲踴躍。該處近爲鼓勵出口，並使各該辦法得以切合實况起見，又分別訂定處理基準原則兩種。</p>
<h3>走私出口仍極猖獗　國外桐油市況疲弱</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕據中信局易貨處發表，本週國外桐油市况，續趨疲軟，紐約現貨每磅美金二角四分五，而美國進口商拋售期貨每磅僅售美金二角三分又四分之三，足證桐油來源必另有辦法。上週紐約到貨三千噸，而上海近來運出殊少，加以華南油價繼續增漲，均證明桐油走私出口，仍極猖獗。近據報粤省桐油經開平由海口走私出口者爲數甚多，盼有關方面設法制止。至國外猪鬃市况則穩俏。</p>
<p>〔又訊〕中信局自於本週一調整桐油收購價格後，以收價與黑市價仍相差百分之二十左右，故本市本週仍無法收進，收購審價委員明日將召開會議，再作商討</p>
<h3>浙省茶貨總額　核定二八八億</h3>
<p>〔本報杭州廿四日電〕（一）今年茶葉生產貸款，農行核定八省共八百億。浙省總額二八八億，貸款數量二萬四千担，標準每祖一百廿萬，至製銷貸款總額僅八千餘億。據估僅浙省即需一萬億，如影饗茶價，勢必减少生產。今全國外銷茶，年產廿五萬担，浙省佔十萬祖。</p>
<h3>絲綢上升</h3>
<p>人造絲昨市先昂後降，一二〇號金三馬有光，上午收盤即期升至二億三千五百萬元，週一期做三千八百萬元，下午塲外市况呈疲，終降至二億三千六百萬元賣出價。</p>
<p>廠經昨市升昻，C字等級討價高達三億九千五百萬元，D字喊九千萬元，惟乏成交。高零担成交價三億七千五百萬至八千萬元，老虎灶絲價做六千萬元，只有幾担交易。干經行情，亦頗堅穩</p>
<p>綢貨昨市上升，因原料高昂，人心看好。華强眞絲被面，上午開市最大曾到一億五千〇七十萬元，後吿退降，收市即期做四千八百七十萬元。大誠格子壁縐棧單，昨市與上日相仿。</p>

<h3>印華選手團抵滬　向全運自先報到　全隊五十九人實力可觀</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕全運首批選手印尼華僑代表隊，一行五十九人，昨午乘渣華寳樹雲輪抵埠。全運籌備會及本市南洋歸國華僑團體等，均赴公和祥碼頭歡迎，一行下輪後，即分往金門揚子兩飯店休息。總領除丘佐榮，下午特赴江灣大會註册組，辦理報到手續，副領隊吳揚明，聞將於日內單獨乘機來滬。</p>
<p>印華實力</p>
<p>游泳籃球　印尼代表團實力堅强，據稱：各個選手之最高成績紀錄，均極爲優異。男子游泳吳傳玉百公尺自由式六十三秒，鍾天生百公尺仰泳一分十七秒，黄丁備及兪順源則均在一分十五秒以內。男子籃球隊途經西貢，曾以四九比卅一擊敗當地勁旅華聯隊，女子籃球於過港時，亦以廿五比二十擊敗香港女籃冠軍香島隊，實力至堪驚異。</p>
<p>綱球田徑　男子網球中，陳立超曾在港與香島網球名將葉觀雄作友誼賽，第一盤四比六負，第二盤六比三勝，結果各得一盤言和。雙打選手李文宣李文成兄弟，在港亦曾與草地健將徐惠培徐潤培交綏，結果雖以五比七及二比六小挫，但表演出色，港輿論界交相讚譽。女網球選手陳金石在港時雖亦以二比六負於肯脫夫人，惟旅途勞頓，猶能與强敵周旋，極得各界好評。女子田徑中，陳榮棠此次毅然東山再起，參加三鐵角逐，預料當可重現第六屆全運時鉛球鐵餅，雙料冠軍之威風。綜觀該隊實力，女籃可能較男籃爲强，男網球陳立超技術不凡。　時如無凶悍强敵，左券不難掌握。女網球陳金石·張美珊·俱爲一時之選，在女網競爭中，更難輕侮。</p>

<h3>互助論</h3>
<p>— 吳庸</p>
<p>「天助自助者」這－句話，我們只可以用來作為勉勵人們自立的口號，卻不可以之作為見危不加援手的托辭。人與人間問然不應有依賴的劣性，可是人人不可不存互助的心理。</p>
<p>只是我們要想獲得人家的帮助，必先須去帮助人家，正如你要人家來愛護你，你必須先去愛護人家一樣。我們到了事業失敗，日暮途窮的時候，往往會說些「人情淡薄」「世態炎涼」一類的話，可是我們得捫心自問一下：我們自己於待人接物之際是否絕對不曾抱過不關痛癢的態度呢？「在家靠父母，出門靠朋友」這一句俗語，并不是叫我們對朋友存着一種依賴的心理，而是指示我們對朋友應有的態度。我們於對人援手之際，本來不應妄存望報之念；只是你帮助了人家，人家自會來帮助你，此乃一定的道理。所以　經熊先生曾說：「天助助人者。」</p>
<p>嘗於西洋雜誌裏讀到一篇關於「捨己助人」的文章。那篇文章記述一個美國的傘兵，於二次大戰中降落在法國的德軍防綫之內，為避免被德軍捉獲起見，乃要求一位法國女子予以庇護；這位女子慨然應允把傘兵藏在衣櫥裏，可是不久即為德軍搜獲，德軍便立即把這位法國女子的丈夫捉去，在門前空地上槍殺了。這個傘兵於被押赴營途中，設法乘隙逃走，後面有德國兵士追蹤着，這個傘兵目顧四週，除了那位法國女子的屋子之外，並無其他足供藏身之處；傘兵便又躡足走向那個屋子去。他看見那位被德兵槍殺的法國男子的屍體還躺在門前的空地上，那位法國女子站在門口淌淚。他上前要求她再度予以庇護。那位女子竟又慨然應允，亳無難色。這個傘兵因而得以獲救。這位法國女子深明大義，可謂懂得互助之真諦了。這種行為乃是互助精神之最崇高的表現。</p>
<p>只是自達爾文倡「生存競爭，適者生存」之說以來，學者間頗有認為對貧弱予以援助乃是阻礙人羣之進化者。英儒斯賓塞即是其中的一位。他於「羣學肄言」中說：「以物競天擇之行，造物方汰其不能，而責人人以自立，其羣乃昌；而昧者乃以煦煦之仁，毀天之功，使不得有進羣之效。」其意蓋為社會乃一戰場，勝者即是優秀之輩，敗者便是不良份子，這乃是自然的淘汰作用；我們若是對於弱者予以扶助，此於社會的演進亳無益處，而且有害。這種說法非但太殘酷，而且依此推論，今日社會上那些只顧自己私利不管人家死活的殘暴份子便理該是人羣里的中堅份子，而那些抱着捨己救人拾身飼虎之精神的人們都是傻瓜了。正如斯賓　自己所說：「充類至義，凡所以鋤強　禁　欺，事皆可己，何則，凡此皆救其所不能自救，而保其所不能自保者也，皆將使罷贏劣弱之民存焉，而衍其種嗣者也。且推而論之，將醫藥方術可以不講，　　可以不防，何則，以其皆砥礪民質，使終於至強，而使不宜者無遺種也。」試問天下寗有此理？</p>
<p>須知互助亦為生存競爭中最必要的條件之一。「互助論」的作者克魯泡特金說得好：「在動物界中，向前發展乃和互助並立，而向後很步則和動物間的互鬨相伴。拿人類來說，兩個相衝突的國家，都市，黨派，或部族，彼此交綏，獲勝利者總是屬於內部很能互助的方面。」</p>
<h3>湖上曉日</h3>
<p>— 雷紅</p>
<p>船傍「中獨山」麓，湖上週圍已是黑得看不見什麼了。幸好有明月半規，照着山徑，　級登山，進州一道圍牆，在叢樹間覓取小路，曲析登臨，一座軒敞的房屋造在半山，這是我們借宿之處的小蓬萊山館的醉樂堂。</p>
<p>屋子裏面掛了一盞汽油燈，便是山間唯一的照明。從這裏望到湖上，借着微弱的月光，依稀可以辨認出一點遠山來。而四周寂靜，微波拍岸的沙沙聲也可以聽得出來。山上畜有一頭野犬，狺狺向着生人狂吠，乃是衝破了游人碎語，唯一不安於寂寞的反抗者。</p>
<p>我們晚飯已罷，即行入睡，為了明天早晨起來看曉日。大部份游客都不能好好入睡，找着老媽子要茶耍水，老媽子一面張羅茶水，一面東扯西拉和游客聊天，一直到十二時過後，才算更深人靜，都入睡鄉裏去。</p>
<p>我睡到晨間四時半，再也不能闔眼，便穿衣起身。那老媽子已經精神抖擻地起來為游客預備茶水。此時天色微曙，湖上已有二三布帆，緩緩移動着。東面有一綫曙光，是灰黯天空中的一抹紅霞。南部便是　頭渚，則是籠罩在濃重的霧氣之下，還分辨不出房舍樹木。</p>
<p>紅霞的地方漸漸放出金光，初昇的旭日紅得如此之絢麗，像神劃破了手臂，在鉛灰色的天空中灑下點點的血跡。初日的上昇，速度非常驚人，只是二三分鐘，已經　現出一鈎「新月形」的太陽，而四周的雲彩益呈光亮，四　是黎明了，遠望對山的霧氣，還裊裊成為一圈，逗留在山尖不忍離去。</p>
<p>太陽再昇起，不消十分鐘，巳經完全湧現出來，微風自　上拂來，於是山青水綠，貼在遠處的一面布帆，顯得如此之安穩，像不會受到塵世的紛擾似的。</p>
<p>南面的紅瓦洋屋，雜在碧樹叢中，被陽光照耀着，更其　到絢麗如圖畫了。</p>
<h3>林白水　邵飄萍　張漢舉</h3>
<p>— 翼雲</p>
<p>北平昔在軍閥時代，言論極不自由，新聞記者稍一不慎，即有殺身之禍。林白水主社會日報，其社評中好作謔語，其報亦以是而暢銷，黃郛當政時，嘗時致嘲誚，及直魯軍興，偶引「雜事秘辛」　褻語，謔而近虐，竟觸軍閥之怒，捕而殺之。傳被捕從，曾書有遺囑，其第一語，為「我命在頃刻，」令人悽然。</p>
<p>同時繼林而死者，為京報之邵飄萍，聞林之變已匿居交民巷，不敢輕出，顧其妾在家，與妻詬誶甚厲，極思一歸，乃以電話詢之同業張漢舉，張　力言無妨，邵信之，車甫出交民巷，即被逮而死矣。邵好修飾，衣服麗都，年屆不惑，猶翩翩如少年，與人語，聲極低和，報中經費偶絀，即典衣裘以充，頗得同人之歡，其死也，人多惜之。</p>
<p>張漢舉，名鵬，綽號「夜　張三，」其時正以記者身份，代表警備司令某，招待報界，勢甚煊赫，故邵欲出時，先以電話取決於張，竟為所誤，實則張之左右，早為密報所監視，待張宗昌一到，即將繼林邵而死，張則不知也。幸警察總監李某，與張有舊，宗昌將至，李道迎專車中，語及張事，李笑曰，彼即所謂夜　張三也，大帥之彈至寶貴，以擊夜　，殊為可惜。語極詼諧，宗昌大笑，而張亦倖免矣。越歲，以某名伶宅中，忽來暴客，勒索巨款，張代與周旋，乃被擊死，張不死於報，而死於暴客，亦張之不　也。</p>

<p>— 施濟美</p>
<p>世上最可悲的人，是那些偏見最多的人。但是，一個沒有偏見的人，就又透着不可愛了。</p>

<p>撒謊是一種美麗的藝術，也是危險的游戲。</p>
<p>沒有幻想的人，是傻瓜；太多幻想的人，是瘋子。</p>

<h3>引玉</h3>
<p>— 賀天健</p>
<p>余日前參加賞櫻會，曾賦詩兩律，在本刊披露；一時和簡紛來，至今未絕，人數之多有四五十人，地域之廣，本市及南通至南京杭州，或許再擴延他處亦未可知，誠盛事也。</p>
<p>余於詩，雖為平生所好，惜乎不工，徒以情感所發，偶拈韵語耳；而此番所獲諸公和詩則皆精妙異常，高青邱言詩須重意，格，韻，諸公之詩，誠意切而活，格高而恬，韻幽而亮者也。余之拋磚引玉，不圖於此實觀！蓋非五十年來一大快事而何！</p>
<p>此次賞櫻會之由地方首長舉辦，其意義固不僅在與民共樂，多少有提倡國粹文化之用意，欲感發情緒，非詩莫屬。論理，合應出一刊物，俾諸作得彙集成冊，作一紀念。年年如此，則懲往惕來，於國人不無有益，惜未聞有此措置，奈何！</p>
<p>余昨日適自家鄉展墓還，因乘便到宜興登　墨山及故鄉西神山西神山最高，從首至尾而下，當時並不覺疲憊，不料越兩日牙痛如刺，體熱如炙，蓋風熟內扇也。榻間讀諸公詩，循環浣誦，歡喜無量，如何而使諸公之心血不白費，正在設法，本撥一一拜復，因體力尚待加復，未能多用腦力，容待漸漸酬答，好在諸公均有地址，特假此地謝謝。</p>
<h3>父親的約會</h3>
<p>— 葛春良</p>
<p>——這故事是我的一個朋友告訴我的，因為現在他已經死了，我覺得說說也不妨……。</p>
<p>這故事發生在一家景緻幽麗的荷蘭小酒家中，那酒家是專供旅行者們飲食的。那時我和父親在一同旅行，非常快樂。</p>
<p>「可惜你母親不能來，」父親說，「帶她各處走走，一定使她快活的。」</p>
<p>他在年輕時曾到過荷蘭，我問他，「你在多少年前來過此地？」</p>
<p>「唔，大概有三十年了。我記得也在這酒家中…」他回頭四望，　尋他的回憶。「那些正是美麗的日子——」他突然停止說話了，我看見他的面孔變成了慘白了。我跟隨着他的眼睛的視綫，我看見一個女人托着一隻盤，送酒給顧客。她在從前一定是很美麗的，但是現在她肥胖了，頭髮也很骯髒。「你認識她嗎？」我問。</p>
<p>「以前是認識的。」他說</p>
<p>那女人到我們桌旁，粗魯地問，「喝酒嗎？」</p>
<p>「啤酒。」我說。那女人點點頭，去了。</p>
<p>「她已經改變得這樣了！謝天謝地，她沒有把我認出來。」父親喃喃地說，一面用一塊手帕揩着面上的汗。「在未遇到你母親之前，我就認識了她。」他繼續說。「那時，我是一個學生，來旅行的。她是一個可愛的少女，非常的莊重和高貴。我瘋狂地愛上了她，她也愛我。」</p>
<p>「母親認識她嗎？」我不大高興地叫了出來。</p>
<p>「當然。」父親溫文地說。</p>
<p>他有些恐懼地向我望望，我代他感到有些窘。</p>
<p>我說：「爸，你儘可不必告訴我——」</p>
<p>「噢，我要告訴你的。我不要你瞎想。她的父親反對我們的戀愛。我是一個外國人，我沒有什麼前途或希望，我是靠父親輔助的。我寫信給父親說我要結婚了，他就把津貼我的錢一概取消。於是我祇得回家了。但是我再和那少女會面－次，告訴她我回到美國去，去借錢來結婚，過幾個月回來迎接她。」</p>
<p>他繼續說：「我們知道他父親也許會偷拆信的，所以我們互相同意我祗要寄給她一張紙頭，上面寫一個日期，到那大她到某一個約定的地點來見我，便去結婚。啊，於是我到家鄉借錢，把那個日期寄給她。」</p>
<p>「以後怎樣？」我問。</p>
<p>「她收到了那紙條。她寫給我這句子：『我一定到那裏的。』但是，她沒有來。後來，我發現她已在兩星期前結婚了，嫁給了當地的一個酒店主。她沒有等候我。」</p>
<p>接着，我父親說，「感謝上帝，幸虧她沒有來。我回家了，遇到了你的母親，我們一直到現在非常的快樂。我們還常常把這可笑的戀愛史互相開玩笑的。」</p>
<p>那女人把我們的啤酒帶來了。</p>
<p>「你是從美國來的嗎？」她問我。</p>
<p>「是的。」我說。</p>
<p>她面孔光彩煥發地說，「美國，一個可愛的地方！」</p>
<p>「是的，許多貴國人仕都到美國丟了。你也想去嗎？」</p>
<p>「我不去。現在決不去了！」她說，「有一個時期，我這樣的想過，很久很久以前了。但是我留在此地，此地比較好。」我們喝乾了啤酒，走了出來。</p>
<p>在外面，我說，「父親，你約她的日期是怎樣寫的呀？」</p>
<p>他立停了，拿出了一隻信封，在上面寫了12/71/13。「這樣的，「他說，「12/11/13。十二，十一，十三；當然囉！意思是十二月十一日，在一九一三年。」</p>
<p>「不是的！」我叫喊着說，「美國人是如此寫的，可是丹麥或其他任何國歐洲的國家都不道樣。在此地，他們先寫日子，然後再寫月份。所以你寫的日刻不是十二月十一日，而是十一月十二日呀！」</p>
<p>父親用手遮住面孔說，「啊，那麼她去的！」他叫喊着說，「那是因為我沒有出現，於是她等我不來，便去結婚了。」他靜默了一會兒。「啊，」他說，「我希望她在這裏很快樂。她看上去是很快樂呢！」</p>
<p>當我們繼續在漫步時，我說，「幸虧是這樣的，不然，你遇不到母親了。」</p>
<p>他把他的手臂圍住我的肩膀，面上露出一個熱心的微笑，說，「孩子，我感到那是加倍的幸運呢！因為，否則，我也不會遇到你了！」</p>

<h3>The National Assembly Holds Another Vote: No Vice President Yet, Third Election Meeting This Morning</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 24th] The National Assembly held its second vice-presidential election meeting at 9:30 AM on the 24th. Li Zongren, Sun Ke, and Cheng Qian, the top three candidates from the first meeting's voting results, proceeded to the second round of voting. The outcome was that none of them secured the required majority, resulting in the failure to elect a vice president. In accordance with the law, Li, Sun, and Cheng will be subjected to a third election. Zhang Xiwen presided over today's meeting, with 2,765 representatives in attendance. After announcing the start of the meeting, the Secretary-General first reported the names of the vote-counting supervisors determined by the presidium through a lottery. He then restated the order of today's vote before promptly instructing the supervisors to assume their respective posts. The distribution of ballots, writing of ballots, and voting commenced swiftly at 10:05 AM. The entire voting process concluded rapidly, taking only until 10:50 AM. Subsequently, after the Chairman and supervisors completed their final votes, the process still did not exceed 11:00 AM. The event proceeded smoothly, with only minor unrest occurring when some representatives on the upper level expressed dissatisfaction that a certain individual, not a National Assembly representative but a candidate, was seated in an official seat. However, the situation quickly subsided. Following the collection of the twelve ballot boxes at the presiding platform, the session was reconvened at 11:08 AM. The Secretary-General explained the vote-counting procedure, and the actual count commenced at 11:30 AM, concluding at 1:00 PM. Of the 2,765 representatives present, 2,760 cast ballots. Thirty-six ballots were invalid, leaving 2,724 valid ballots. Li Zongren received the most votes, totaling 1,163. Sun Ke came in second with 945 votes, and Cheng Qian received the fewest with 616. The meeting adjourned around 1:00 PM, with the afternoon session recessed.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 24th] Chairman Chiang, concerned about the vice-presidential election, visited the assembly hall again today. However, he did not vote, remaining in the presidium's office for a short time before departing.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 24th] The third vice-presidential election meeting of the National Assembly is scheduled for 9:00 AM on the 25th. The candidates vying for election remain Li Zongren, Sun Ke, and Cheng Qian. Li Wenfan will chair the meeting, as decided by the presidium at its 34th meeting on the evening of the 24th. The ballots for the third election have been rushed into production by the secretariat and are already printed. The format remains the same, but the background is white with green text, listing the names of Li Zongren, Sun Ke, and Cheng Qian. The presidium appointed representatives Mei Youzhuo, Li Shizhen, and Chen Shirui that evening to stamp the meeting seal and affix personal seals and signatures for safekeeping, to be unsealed in public at the meeting on the morning of the 25th. The presidium also appointed Feng Youzhen, Ma Hongkui, and Ye Xiufeng as vote-taking and counting supervisors through a lottery selection by the representatives, totaling one hundred and ten people.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 24th] It has been decided that the certificates of election for the President and Vice President will be presented in the assembly hall after the Vice President is elected. This will be the last item on the agenda before the closing of the National Assembly. There had been a proposal to send them to the National Government, but this has been abandoned. It is reported that the presidium has tentatively nominated Yu Youren to represent the Assembly in presenting the President's election certificate. The format of the election certificate was discussed extensively at the presidium meeting on the evening of the 24th, but no decision was reached. The matter has been referred to the secretariat for preliminary design before being submitted to the presidium meeting for decision.</p>
<h3>Truman and Marshall Congratulate Chairman Chiang on His Election as President; Ambassador Expresses Satisfaction and Hopes the Aid to China Act Will Be Effective</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 24th] US President Truman, Secretary of State Marshall, and Ambassador Stuart recently sent congratulatory messages to Chairman Chiang upon his election as the first President of the Republic of China. The respective letters and telegrams are as follows:</p>
<p>[Truman's Congratulatory Telegram] To Chairman Chiang: I have been directed by the President of the United States to convey the following congratulatory message: "I am pleased to learn of Your Excellency's election as the first constitutional President. I, along with the American people, extend our sincere congratulations." I, too, offer my congratulations. Our two countries have enjoyed a long-standing friendship, and the American people are deeply concerned about China's progress on the path to modern democracy. China has suffered greatly during eight years of war, and has yet to recover from those wounds, now facing internal strife, the gravity of which would be insurmountable by other nations lacking such resilience. Your Excellency's assumption of the presidency coincides with the passage of the Foreign Assistance Act by the United States Congress, which is gratifying. I hope that the implementation of this act will alleviate the heavy burden on the Chinese people. I believe Your Excellency shares this sentiment. I wish you and the Chinese people success. Sincerely, Stuart.</p>
<p>[Marshall's Congratulatory Telegram] I am delighted to hear of Your Excellency's election as the first President of China's constitutional government. I wish you continued success in leading China. Sincerely, Marshall.</p>
<p>[Our Zhangjiakou Dispatch, 24th] Today, all sectors of Chahar Province celebrated Chairman Chiang's election as the first president. Flags were displayed throughout the city, and lanterns were hung at night. Government offices and schools were closed for a day. A celebration was held at the public stadium at noon, attended by over 30,000 people.</p>
<h3>The First Legislators Elected Under the Constitution Begin Registration Procedures</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 24th] The first legislators elected under the Constitution will automatically convene on the seventh day after the closing of the National Assembly. The Secretariat of the Legislative Yuan has been instructed to establish the Preparatory Office for the Assembly of the First Legislators under the Constitution, with Lou Tongsun appointed as Secretary-General. The office published a notice in the newspaper on the 24th, stating that registration would begin at the Legislative Yuan on the 24th. On the 24th, the duly elected legislators who officially registered throughout the day included Zhao Juxu, Mei Shuhui, Zhu Qiming, Wang Chunbi, Ma Youqiao, Chen Jiesheng, Feng Junlian, and Wu Shipeng, totaling eight individuals. They registered by presenting their certificates of election issued by the election office and received Registration Certificate No. 1, which was obtained by Zhao Juxu. In addition, there were eighteen individuals who claimed to be officially elected legislators nominated by the Central Government: Zhang Zhijiang, Bao De椰, Su Jingquan, Xu Dachuan, Li Qia, Wang Huamin, Yu Lingyun, Yang Gongda, Pi Yishu, Huang Qiang, Li Shuzi, Qu Zhisheng, Cai Zhisheng, Miao Qiping, Yang Juetian, Xiang Jutan, Lu Daizeng, and Liang Juwu. They also went to the office at 4:30 PM on the 24th to register. The registration office staff stated that they could not register them because they did not have certificates of election. Zhang and the others forcibly took the registration book and signed it individually, but they were unable to obtain registration certificates. Xu Yun, the person in charge of the registration office, stated that this dispute was unresolvable and would be reported to Secretary-General Lou Tongsun for instructions. The 25th is a Sunday holiday, and registration will be suspended for one day. Registration will resume on the 26th.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 24th] The Legislative Yuan was originally scheduled to hold its tenth provisional meeting on the 24th, but it has been postponed due to unforeseen circumstances. The two proposals, the National Assembly and the supplementary measures for the election of legislators, will likely be delayed until the 353rd regular meeting on the 29th for discussion.</p>
<h3>National Army Advancing East in Central Shandong Captures Zhoucun and Wangcun</h3>
<p>[Our Xuzhou Dispatch, 24th] The National Army advancing east along the Jiaoji Railway in central Shandong captured Zhoucun and Wangcun yesterday, killing over 500 bandits and seizing six light machine guns. The remaining bandits fled eastward in a state of disarray.</p>
<p>[Our Jinan Dispatch, 24th] The bandits besieging Weixian, in order to seize time in the face of the National Army reinforcements advancing from east and west, attempted to quickly capture Weixian. On the night of the 23rd, they launched a fierce attack on the northeastern corner and northern and southern passes of Weixian with the strength of three divisions, supported by over 30 artillery pieces. The battle was extremely fierce. The city wall was breached in three places by bandit artillery, and the bandits penetrated the northern city five times. After the defending troops engaged in hand-to-hand street fighting, four penetrations were annihilated. The bandits who penetrated the city for the fifth time continued to engage in street fighting as of noon on the 24th. The Tian Ma garrison retreated to Changle on the 23rd.</p>
<h3>Bandit Assault Group Leader in Taihu, Xu Quangen, Defects with Arms</h3>
<p>And Presents the Head of a Squad Leader as Proof of Merit</p>
<p>[Our Suzhou Dispatch, 24th] The Taihu Clearing Command in Wu County suddenly had bandit assault group leader Xu Quangen defect with arms on the afternoon of the 23rd, and presented the head of bandit short gun squad leader Qiu Jinan as proof of merit. Considering Xu's commendable self-reformation, the command will accept and employ him.</p>
<h3>Northern Anhui Bandits Flee to the Northern Bank of the Wo River</h3>
<p>[Our Xuzhou Dispatch, 24th] The bandits who captured Bo County in northern Anhui continued to flee to the southeast of Meng County, northwest of Guoyang, and the northern bank of the Wo River area on the 23rd. The National Army is currently encircling and suppressing them.</p>
<h3>The National Army Retreats from Duolun in Northern Chahar; Victory Achieved in the Defense of Ying County; Bandits Fail to Achieve Success Despite Using Poison Gas</h3>
<p>[Our Beiping Dispatch, 24th] The North China Bandit Suppression Headquarters announced: (1) The retreat from Duolun in northern Chahar. Over 4,000 Communist bandits advanced on the city from Fengning and Weichang on the 20th and 23rd. The commissioner and county magistrate proactively withdrew on the 22nd and are now waiting for an opportunity to annihilate the bandits in the vicinity. (2) The Communist bandits' attack on Ying County is waning, and the defending forces are preparing to counterattack. (3) South of the Sanggan River in southern Chahar, the National Army continued to capture Da Xiaojingergou last night, killing over 200 bandits. The Second Bandit Column is fleeing southwest.</p>
<p>[Our Taiyuan Dispatch, 24th] On the morning of the 23rd, bandits launched a fierce assault on the southeastern and southwestern corners of Ying County, erecting cloud ladders under the cover of artillery fire and swarming up the city walls, engaging in close-quarters combat. By midnight, nearly a thousand had been killed or wounded. On the morning of the 24th, they switched to a stealth attack, using demolition teams to dig tunnels in an attempt to destroy the southwestern city wall. They were annihilated by the defending troops in counter-trench warfare. Yan Xishan stated that the bandits' attack on Ying County was intended to open a passage between the Jin-Ji and Tong-Sui lines. The bandit offensive against Linfen has weakened, and the bandits are gradually moving north to block the National Army advancing south. He praised Liang Peihuang, the defending general, for his determination and initiative. Deng Wenyi also sent a telegram to Liang to express his respect.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Taiyuan, 24th] The defense of Ying County reached its climax. The Communist bandits, inhumanely, even used smoke and poison gas shells, which are prohibited by national defense regulations. The bandit army, with forces several times larger than the defending garrison, launched relentless attacks but failed to achieve success. Starting at 5:00 PM on the 22nd, they launched a general offensive again, swarming forward under the cover of intense artillery fire and smoke and poison gas. They employed a revolving door tactic, launching over thirty waves of attacks and firing over a thousand artillery shells. Several sections of the city walls on the southeast and southwest corners were destroyed by the bandits' fire. At 10:00 PM, the bandits released poison gas smoke shells at the breaches on the southeast and southwest corners of the city wall and erected ladders, forcibly scaling the outer walls. The defending troops fought bravely, engaging the bandits in unprecedented close-quarters combat. At midnight, they finally repelled the main force of the attacking bandits on all fronts. The bandits also suffered heavy casualties, and their offensive was thwarted. By dawn on the 23rd, the bandits were only mounting small-scale harassing attacks, and the situation gradually calmed down. It is estimated that over three thousand bandit troops were killed or wounded in this battle. Upon receiving the news of the victory, Director Yan sent a special telegram to commend Commander Zhang Pu and all the officers and soldiers.</p>

<h3>Guan Linzheng Discusses the Current Situation in the Northeast</h3>
<p>Communist Bandits Entering Shanhaiguan is Still Not Possible</p>
<p>[Our Beiping Dispatch, 24th] Guan Linzheng, after inspecting the Northeast, stated: There may be a major war in the Northeast in May. The Communist bandits may target Shenyang. It is currently not possible for the Communist bandits in the Northeast to enter Shanhaiguan. He stated: Since Wei Lihuang arrived in the Northeast, morale has greatly improved, and there are no major problems in maintaining the current situation. However, the environment in the Northeast is too difficult, and more strength is needed to develop it. Guan also emphasized that the Northeast is the lifeline of the nation. The Northeast is rich in both coal and iron, which are necessary for an agricultural country to move towards industrialization. A country without an independent industry cannot have an independent defense. Guan inspected the Second Officer Training Corps on the 24th and will soon fly to Taiwan, Xi'an, and Dihua for inspections.</p>
<p>Views on the Situation in Shaanxi</p>
<p>Guan also stated: The current situation in Shaanxi is indeed as serious as that in the Northeast, but the causes are complex and cannot be attributed to General Hu Zongnan alone. General Hu has outstanding military talent, and I believe he will be able to maintain the situation in Shaanxi. Guan cautiously answered reporters' questions, saying: The serious situation in Shaanxi is due to troop strength and troop movements. He pointed out that to break the situation in Shaanxi, new forces should be added. He believes that the nature of total war requires political cooperation with the military and strengthening local forces. He believes that under the current situation, the coordination of the Jin-Shaanxi war situation cannot be discussed.</p>

<h3>National Assembly Proceedings: Vice Presidential Election - Runoff</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from This Newspaper] The vice presidential election battle has entered the runoff stage. Today's session of the National Assembly seemed even more heated than yesterday. Although the number of candidates had been reduced from six to three, the intense competition was clearly reflected in every corner of the venue today. To avoid provocative propaganda, the presidium specifically stipulated that leaflets were not allowed to be distributed inside the venue today. However, outside the hall, newspapers, leaflets, and various promotional materials were still flying everywhere. Sun Ke's promotional "train" emitted calls to "elect Sun Ke as Vice President" outside the assembly hall. People wearing badges identifying them as special guests or government officials were seen in twos and threes, maneuvering among the representatives, occasionally whispering.</p>
<p>Li Zongren, riding on the momentum of yesterday's victory, arrived at the venue early with a smile that conveyed both triumph and tension, accompanied by his wife, Guo Dejie. Wearing his government official badge, he stood in front of the assembly hall at 9:00 AM, just as he did yesterday, shaking hands with the representatives one by one. Guo Dejie stood inside the door, and almost no representative escaped her gaze. She immediately followed up with enthusiastic handshakes. Today, she seemed even happier and more optimistic than before. "Please help! Help! Help!" her voice continuously rang out. When she met familiar representatives, she affectionately patted their shoulders, repeatedly saying, "A wink is as good as a nod! A wink is as good as a nod! A wink is as good as a nod!" One representative, as if reporting a successful mission, said to her, "I voted for Mr. Li yesterday, and I'll vote for Mr. Li today." She immediately replied, "There are still two rounds to go. Please continue to help!" When Weng Wenhao entered the venue, she also grabbed him and asked, "Who will your conscience vote for?" Weng smiled and replied, "I'll vote for my conscience."</p>
<p>Help from the Supportive Wife in Campaigning</p>
<p>Sun Yat-sen's wife, Madam Chen Shuying, also stood inside the hall, closely beside Ma Chaojun's wife, Shen Huilian. Both greeted the representatives warmly with beaming smiles. Although Madam Sun was usually not as active and eloquent as Madam Li, she appeared particularly likable today. She and Madam Ma stood in front of Madam Li, and every representative first shook hands with them before approaching Madam Li. Madam Ma jokingly said, "I'm here to invite guests. I want to invite my good friends to visit Sun Yat-sen's Mausoleum and Xuanwu Lake."</p>
<p>Cheng Qian did not have supportive wives like Li Zongren and Sun Ke canvassing for votes at the entrance. Nevertheless, he sincerely and enthusiastically interacted with the representatives inside the venue. He was still wearing that old black suit. Due to his sincerity and honest charm, he surprisingly secured third place yesterday. Today, he continued to exert his best efforts.</p>
<p>The atmosphere inside the venue was tense. However, the voting process had been improved through one or two revisions, and today's situation was better than yesterday's. The meticulous arrangements made by the General Secretariat of the Assembly in advance reduced the voting time by fifteen minutes compared to yesterday, and the vote counting was almost an hour faster than yesterday. By 1:10 PM, the results of the runoff were already presented to the representatives.</p>
<p>Yu, Mo, and Xu Display Democratic Spirit</p>
<p>There was a particularly touching scene amidst the tension during the voting. Yu Youren, Xu Fulin, and Mo Dehui, the three candidates who were eliminated in yesterday's preliminary round, all attended today's session to cast their sacred vote. Although today's three candidates were their opponents yesterday, after the preliminary round, Mr. Yu, Mr. Mo, and Mr. Xu all respected the voters' choice and cast their votes for their former campaign rivals. When Yu Youren and the others deposited their ballots into the ballot box, the representatives expressed their respect for their democratic spirit with enthusiastic applause, and the photographers rushed to capture the valuable moment.</p>
<p>During the one hour and forty minutes of vote counting, the venue was constantly shrouded in a tense atmosphere. Wave after wave of applause evoked various expressions of joy, anger, sorrow, and happiness from the representatives. The vote counters' voices reverberated in the hearts of the two thousand-plus representatives, and everyone felt the heavy pressure in the air. When the runoff results were announced, Li Zongren once again overwhelmingly defeated Sun and Cheng with 1,163 votes, taking the lead. However, they will have to face off one more time tomorrow to eliminate one more person or directly elect the vice president. The vote count from the twelve ballot boxes also presented a tense sequence during today's vote counting process. Li Zongren took the lead in the first ballot box with 94 votes, and Li continued to be in the lead until the fifth ballot box. In the total of the five ballot boxes, the ratio of Li, Sun, and Cheng was 463 to 370 to 321, which was not a significant difference. In the sixth ballot box, Sun Ke exceeded Li Zongren by a majority of 190 votes compared to Li's 121 votes. However, Li's total was 584 votes, still exceeding Sun Ke's total of 560 votes, maintaining the lead. At this point, Cheng Qian was more than 150 votes behind Li and Sun. Cheng, Li, and Sun were neck and neck in the seventh ballot box. In the eighth ballot box, Sun Ke and Li Zongren had a ratio of 99 to 39, and Sun achieved the overall lead for the first time. However, in the ninth ballot box immediately following, Li quickly caught up, regaining the lead with a majority of 123 votes. In the tenth ballot box, Li's momentum increased, achieving a record of 974 with an absolute majority of 170. At this point, Sun only had 842 votes. Cheng Qian's decline had already started from the seventh ballot box, and by this point, it was irreversible. He only had 526 votes at this time. After all the ballots were counted, Li took the lead with 1,163, while Sun only had 945, and Cheng only had 616. Today was only the result of the runoff. The final outcome remains to be seen tomorrow or the day after. (April 24, Nanjing)</p>

<h3>Weekly Forum: Science and Life</h3>
<p>— Chen Anren</p>
<p>The scientific view of life and the relationship between science and life have different meanings. The former is the concept of life as expressed scientifically, while the latter explains the relationship between science and life. The former is the ideal of life as explained by science, while the latter indicates its direction from the perspective of science's influence on the achievements of life. The focus of the two aspects is different, but they are still interconnected. Please elaborate on the interconnected aspects as follows:</p>
<p>(A) Science Eliminates Obstacles and Suffering in Life In primitive times, human psychology was immature, and people often experienced surprise and terror towards the things of the universe and nature. They used superstition and fear of gods to replace all understanding of things. In this era, it was not easy for their thoughts and actions to embark on the path of science. Those who were slightly more evolved tried to eliminate various obstacles and sufferings in the natural and human world. For example, the "Bushmen" and the "pygmies" in Central Africa could make poison arrows for self-defense, the Iroquois could build bark houses, the Eskimos could build snow houses, and the British Columbians could build underground houses, all to reduce the suffering of natural cold. Various means of transportation were also gradually invented at this time, such as the cowhide boats of the American Indians, the large canoes of the Northwest, the sealskin boats of the Eskimos, and the assembled bark boats of Australia. In general, the more advanced human knowledge, the more people use scientific common sense to overcome the suffering and obstacles of the natural world. For example, humans could not freely travel in the sky, but with the advancement of aeronautics, airplanes and airships were successively invented, and they could travel freely in the clouds. Furthermore, humans could not survive in the suffocating atmosphere of the seabed, but with the invention of submarines, they could emerge and stay in the vast ocean. Life comes with sorrow and worry. Although there is still no way to eradicate suffering, it is not difficult to relatively reduce it. The most important things in life are sickness and death. These diseases and deaths are indeed unavoidable, but with the progress of science and medicine, the pain of illness is gradually reduced, and the lifespan of human beings is gradually extended. Modern scientists can inject camphor when the heart stops beating to prevent the collapse of the organism. Winterstein used a solution containing adrenaline salts to stimulate the heart of an animal that had been killed for three hours, and it was actually revived. It can be seen that the recovery and extension of life can gradually become a reality with the progress of science.</p>
<p>(B) Science Enhances Human Happiness and Well-being The more advanced science is, the more human happiness and well-being are enhanced. This can be explained in many ways. For example, various facilities for clothing, food, housing, and transportation are becoming more and more complete with the development of science, and human lifespan is increasing daily due to the enjoyment of comfort. Taking Europeans and Americans as an example, the average lifespan in the United States in 1920 was 53 years, and it increased by five years to 58 years in 1926. According to the calculations of the Berlin Federal Bureau of Statistics, the average lifespan of Germans in 1750 was 40 years, and it was 50 years in 1910, and it increased to 60 years in 1920. This is obviously the effect of the progress of medicine and the enjoyment of comfort, this is one aspect. Many people think that science can only give human beings material happiness, and may not be able to give human beings spiritual happiness, this is also not true. Because material happiness can often increase to spiritual pleasure. For example, it takes about 30 days to walk from Guilin to Chongqing, but it only takes three hours by plane. This is the second aspect. In Will Durant's letter to pessimists, he said: "Your generation has experienced the great wars of the past. This great war has changed you in every way. You have seen more than a hundred kinds of killing weapons invented one after another, and you have seen many international massacres coming one after another; although countries use diplomatic documents to solve difficulties on the surface, their essence is the unrestrained expression of imperial aggression and commercial competition. You have witnessed this situation, of course, you cannot believe in any form of utopia." However, science can create killing weapons, but it can also create weapons that benefit people. If justice is upheld and the world is unified, the various tragedies mentioned above can be avoided. How can the gifts of science to mankind be limited?</p>
<p>(C) Science Expresses the Value of Human Life Philosophy, religion, ethics, morality, and science are not incompatible with each other, but mutually beneficial. Many people think that the spiritual value of life should be sought in the cultivation of philosophy, religion, morality, and ethics, and cannot be sought in science, which is not entirely true. Buddha, Christ, and Confucius, with the same grand ambition of saving the world, establishing oneself and helping others establish themselves, and achieving oneself and helping others achieve themselves, established models for future generations with religion, ethics, and morality. Their spirit should be immortal. As for scientists' devotion to science, in addition to benefiting mankind and providing for the masses, their lofty personality and excellent academic achievements can often inspire people's ambition and overcome stubbornness.</p>
<p>(D) Science Guides the Future of Life Science includes two aspects, namely method and spirit. The scientific method seeks knowledge, and the scientific spirit seeks faith. Knowledge is the foundation of action, and action is the use of knowledge. Ignorance is not enough to speak of action, so seeking knowledge is to help action, and seeking faith is to seek truth. Truth is the foundation of faith, and untruth is dishonesty. Because science is not metaphysics, it seeks knowledge, action, reality, and faith in everything. The future of life can only be built on the foundation of knowledge, action, honesty, and faith, and then it will be unshakable and able to stand on its own. When Darwin was at Cambridge University, the longer he stayed, the more his interest in exploring natural science grew. After returning from an inspection in North Venice in 1831, with an interest in studying geology, he decided to sail to South America to measure the terrain. He spent six years on the Royal Navy ship Beagle, and had in-depth research in various aspects such as zoology, botany, and geology. The great achievements he later established in science and philosophy were based on this time. This is one example of science guiding life.</p>
<p>In short, science establishes the highest ideals of the world and mankind, and in detail, it also establishes the highest ideals of life. Because its purpose is to establish a world of truth, goodness, and beauty, it must cooperate with religion, philosophy, ethics, morality, and other disciplines to first establish a life of truth, goodness, and beauty. The highest ideals of mankind are the promotion of world humanitarianism, the realization of the idea of world unity, the organization of a world permanent peace mechanism, and the promotion of the spirit of universal love of mankind. The paths are the unification of world culture, the promotion of technology, the communication of academics, the connection of thoughts, the consistency of writing, the integration of religions, the equalization of education, and the exchange of materials. These works all rely on the development of science. Only when totalitarianism, imperialism, aggressionism, militarism, warlordism, and feudalism are completely eliminated, science will benefit the world without harm and make great contributions. Locke said in his 1889 speech: "Now is a period of rapid advancement in natural science. A series of small waves discovered a few months or weeks ago are now combined into a very large wave. On this wave crest, we can see a future great all-encompassing theory." It is only because the rationalism before the 20th century was mixed with all kinds of base thoughts, which caused the great disaster of the world. After painful reflection, this era should be over. In the second half of this era, if everyone is willing to step into the new era of human revival with a new look, they still have to rely on science. Science is ultimately the tool for the highest ideals of the world and mankind.</p>

<p>[This Newspaper News] San Francisco, 24th Broadcast: The Howard newspaper today published a commentary, once again calling on the US government to adopt the proposals of Wedemeyer and Chennault and immediately provide military assistance to China. The newspaper stated: "Now there is a country where the war being waged within its borders is not a 'cold war,' but a 'hot war.' This is China. Within China's borders, the Communists are our recognized enemy, but the assistance we have promised China does not exceed $570 million. In fact, we can provide more effective assistance to China in other ways. We should immediately provide the National Government with military training officers and advisors, as advocated by Wedemeyer and Chennault."</p>
<h3>Ye Gongchao's Talk in Beiping</h3>
<p>Hopes for the Smooth Success of the Korean General Election The China-Thailand Outstanding Cases Should Be Resolved Early</p>
<p>[This Newspaper, Beiping, 24th] Vice Minister Ye Gongchao said in Beiping: (1) The Korean people are eager to demand national unification, independence, and freedom, and China has completely respected this from beginning to end. Therefore, China sincerely hopes that the Korean general election will be smooth and successful. Currently, the Pyongyang Democratic Parties Conference also has representatives from South Korea participating. China hopes that this conference can promote the realization of a unified, independent, and free Korea. (2) Phibun's seizure of power this time does not violate the Thai constitution and has also gained the trust of the Thai parliament. Therefore, there is no doubt that his is a legal government. China should also recognize the Thai government. However, there are many outstanding cases between China and Thailand, and it is hoped that they will be resolved reasonably as soon as possible.</p>

<h3>Bizarre Character in Guangzhou Claims to be a "National Assembly Delegate" Insists on Visiting Soong Tse-ven Entrusted with Purchasing Plane Tickets to Enter Beijing</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper, Guangzhou, 24th] A bizarre character holding business cards for "President of the Merchants Poetry Society," "Mao Ming Art National Assembly Delegate Hsu Ku-tsun" suddenly visited the Guangdong Provincial Government during office hours yesterday, claiming to visit Chairman Soong Tse-ven, entrusted with purchasing plane tickets, flying to Beijing to attend the National Assembly, and forcefully claiming that he had been elected as a National Assembly Delegate. He also presented a reply letter from the Election Headquarters as proof. After inspection by the Provincial Election Office, the letter only stated that the Headquarters replied that he was not elected, but he had added the words "Ordering the member to come to Beijing to attend, this order" under the words "Sincerely" in the letter himself. He also spoke incoherently and took out a pile of nonsensical special publications, insisting on visiting Chairman Soong to prove his identity, causing a disturbance for more than an hour. After much persuasion, he finally agreed to transfer to the National Assembly Reception Station to "register," and said that he had to buy a ticket to fly to Beijing to attend the National Assembly.</p>

<h3>Carelessness at Nanxiang Hairpin Factory Nine Female Workers Buried in the Fire</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper, Jiading, 23rd Dispatch] A celluloid hairpin factory in Nanxiang Rice Lane Street suddenly caught fire on the 22nd due to carelessness.

<h3>Cheating Discovered in Changzhou's Grain Inspection - Tax Grain Sold Off, High-Quality Rice Switched to Inferior Rice</h3>
<p>[Our Wujin Report, 23rd] Corruption and malpractice in this county's Tax Grain Office's collection of land tax for the 36th year of the Republic have been rampant, causing much public outcry. After strict questioning by the Third County Council, a separate investigation committee was formed to conduct an on-site investigation. The first investigation team has now discovered that the office, led by Secretary Lu, transported 4,468 piculs of tax grain from the Xueyanqiao warehouse in the old and new villages of Yingchun to Wuxi to be processed into white japonica rice. 930 bags have already been shipped. This tax grain was arranged by Lu to be transferred through Zhenxing Xie, a contracted rice mill in this county. The factory's resident staff member, Xie, strongly refused, and the matter was exposed. Lu is currently trying to make amends, but the investigation committee has confirmed the evidence and cannot hide it. In addition, Shou Xuefan, an officer dispatched by the Caoqiao Office, escorted tax grain from the countryside to the city in batches, delivering a total of over 1,400 piculs to the Jinfeng Rice Mill. All of it was japonica rice in the countryside, but it all turned into indica rice at the mill. The price difference between high-quality japonica and low-quality indica rice is 100,000 yuan per picul, and the amount of embezzlement is as high as 200 million yuan. The first investigation team has filed charges for the above two cases, and the remaining investigations are continuing.</p>
<h3>20,000 Feet High, Seven Hours of Flight - Exploring Mount Jishi</h3>
<p>— Our Special Correspondent Hong Xucai</p>
<p>[Our Hong Kong Air Report, 23rd] Is it possible that Mount Jishi could surpass Mount Everest and become the world's highest peak? This mystery gradually gained momentum after Renault's ballpoint pens were smuggled into the country. As the legend of Mount Jishi became more and more widespread, the sales of Renault's ballpoint pens also increased. Just as people were developing a strong interest in the mystery of Mount Jishi, Renault quietly slipped away, leaving behind an indelible shame!</p>
<p>Chen Wenkuan, the deputy director of China National Aviation Corporation, said that he had flown over Mount Jishi several times, and based on his experience, he believed that its height could not exceed Mount Everest. To confirm this, he specially allocated a special plane to invite Shanghai news reporters to conduct an on-site survey.</p>
<p>The special plane took off from Shanghai on the 15th of this month. Accompanying were 18 Chinese and foreign reporters. Along the way, it landed in Hankou and Xi'an to refuel. That night, it arrived directly in Lanzhou. The CNAC hosted us at the Northwest Building, which is the best hotel in the area. At 4:30 the next morning, a group bus took us to the airport. Along the way, we enjoyed the scenery of the Northwest in the dim morning light, with yellow sand, red walls, ox carts, and sheep herds.</p>
<p>The special plane was already prepared, but just as I was about to board, the co-pilot Zheng Shijie unexpectedly stopped me. He smiled and told me that I had to take a "crash course in parachuting" before I was qualified to fly at high altitude. My heart jumped. I saw the workers carrying parachutes down from the plane. The thick dust accumulated on the parachutes told me that parachutes were not used lightly. I really did not expect that measuring Mount Jishi would harbor such a serious crisis.</p>
<p>Chen Wenkuan first tried on the parachute himself as a model, and then told everyone to learn how to wear it. As I was fumbling with the clumsy and heavy parachute, Chen Wenkuan came over. He helped me put on the parachute, pointed to the steel handle on my waist, and taught me methodically: "You must pull upwards with force within a few seconds after jumping out of the plane. The parachute will quickly open. Everyone will inevitably be unconscious for the first few seconds, but will quickly regain consciousness. At that time, you should take control yourself, look around, and don't let anyone collide with you. To go east, pull the rope on the east side. To go west, pull the rope on the west side. Avoid falling into the river and try to land on flat ground... Do you understand now?"</p>
<p>When I saw others carrying parachutes on their backs, practicing carefully, and writing their names on the parachutes, I deeply realized the seriousness of the situation. To be honest, I really wanted to escape at the last minute. But then I thought carefully about my fearless spirit before departure, as if I were a hero. If the result was that I ran away with my head in my hands, wouldn't that be a repeat of Renault's scandal? So, I decided to muster my courage and not let myself fall apart. The special plane flew from Lanzhou to the mountain range bordering Gansu and Qinghai. Looking down from the plane, all I could see were endless earthen mountains. The brown mountain ranges rose and fell one after another, endlessly. After flying for an hour, the view suddenly opened up. All I could see was ice and snow, dazzling in the silver light. This was our destination, Mount Jishi.</p>
<p>At this time, the plane gradually rose. When the altimeter pointed to 18,000 feet, everyone began to feel suffocated and uncomfortable. The oxygen equipment in the special plane had already been installed. The thing looked like a gas mask, covering the mouth and nose, and connecting to the oxygen tank. Because I had never used oxygen before, I always felt that the rubber mask was unreliable, and I was afraid that the oxygen would escape before it was inhaled. I pressed the rubber mask tightly against my nose, even rubbing my cheeks. .</p>
<p>When the plane gradually rose above 20,000 feet, I began to feel unsustainable, but I still did not want to take my eyes off the target. What unfolded before my eyes was just a vast expanse of white, endless. It really seemed like the world was Mount Jishi, or that we had entered another world. There, I couldn't see a single person or a single tree. There was no vegetation, no birds or animals. Besides the sky, there were mountains. The snow-capped peaks, one after another, seemed to never end. I don't know when the plane left that place, because when the plane rose to 21,000 feet, I felt dizzy and experienced an indescribable discomfort, which was definitely something I had never experienced in my life. I could no longer pretend to be a "tough guy." I had to lie down in the plane and couldn't move.</p>
<p>The weather was not ideal that day. The clouds were deep, and the wind was strong. When the plane soared into the sky, the turbulence was quite strong, and the taste was really unpleasant. I occasionally raised my head to look. Many faces were pale, and their lips were purple. Along with the sound of vomiting, I thought at that time that it was fortunate that I was not the only one lying down, otherwise it would inevitably give people the impression that "women are not good after all."</p>
<p>From these high-altitude flights, I felt that the physique of the Americans was better than mine. I saw that reporters from Life Magazine, the New York Times, and MGM were active on the plane from beginning to end, jumping around and taking shots. I hated the photographer from Life Magazine the most. He insisted on pointing the camera at my ugly appearance when I was unable to move. I understood that the reason he did this must be to use my half-dead situation to contrast his strength and awesomeness. The more I thought about it, the angrier I got, and I covered my head with my coat.</p>
<p>I don't know how long I slept in a daze. Anyway, when I woke up, the lights in the plane were already on. My companions told me that we were already flying on the way back. Chen Wenkuan had come out of the cockpit and told everyone with a map that he had flown all over the Mount Jishi area and constantly used radar to measure the height of the peaks, but no mountain was over 20,000 feet.</p>
<p>I looked out from the window. It was dark all around. I looked at my watch, and the hour hand was pointing at 7:40. Thinking that according to the budget, it was estimated that we could return in four or five hours, but now we had flown for nearly seven hours, and it was already dark, everyone couldn't help but get a little nervous. The colleague sitting next to me said softly to me: "Lanzhou has no night navigation equipment, and the airport is surrounded by mountains. If we land blindly, it would be too dangerous!"</p>
<p>After he said this, I really felt scared. And at this moment, the door of the cockpit, which had been open all the time, was suddenly closed by the telegraph operator. So the situation became even more critical. Everyone strapped themselves tightly to their seats with seat belts. Many people were also scrambling to sit in the seats connected to the aircraft door, as if the plane was about to crash and he could jump out of the door first.</p>
<p>The plane finally flew over Lanzhou. It circled several times at low altitude. The tension on the faces of the people in the plane at this time can be imagined. But the special plane finally landed safely on the runway. In addition to expressing our gratitude, everyone had to praise Chen Wenkuan's skillful piloting.</p>
<p>In this way, I flew over Mount Jishi. Just as Chen Wenkuan said afterwards: Flying at high altitude for seven hours is definitely not a trivial matter. Being able to receive this experience may be worth commemorating in my life.</p>

<h3>Marshall Rushes Back to Washington from Bogotá to Handle Major Diplomatic Issues - Addressing the Situation in the Holy Land Cannot Be Delayed</h3>
<p>[Our Report] San Francisco Radio, 24th: Marshall told reporters after returning to Washington today that agreements have been reached on most of the fundamental issues at the Bogotá Conference. After returning to Washington, Marshall will immediately discuss important world issues with his advisors.</p>
<p>[Our Report] San Francisco Radio, 24th: Secretary of State Marshall flew back to the country from Bogotá yesterday and arrived in Washington at 9:00 AM this morning. It is said that this sudden return to Washington is due to "particularly important events" awaiting his handling.</p>
<p>[United Press Washington, 24th] Secretary of State Marshall will return to Washington today to handle official business. Although Marshall did not specify what this official business was, officials pointed out that at least four major policy issues await his decision upon his arrival. Marshall's return today is not to deal with any crisis, but to deal with problems accumulated since he left Washington on March 28. The most important are as follows: (1) The United Nations' enforcement of a truce between Jews and Arabs in Palestine, the establishment of a trusteeship government, and the possible dispatch of an international security force to the Holy Land. This matter may not be able to proceed in time to prevent the expansion of the war in Palestine after the United Kingdom ends its mandate on May 15. (2) The US government will decide how to provide military aid to the planned Western European alliance. President Truman hosted reporters on Thursday and announced that a statement on this major diplomatic policy development will be released soon. (3) The situation in Berlin remains precarious, and it remains the most disputed area in the relationship between Western countries and the Soviet Union. (4) The Soviet Union's possible reaction to the Italian Communist Party's election defeat.</p>
<p>[United Press Balboa, Panama Canal Zone, 24th] On his way back to Washington from Bogotá, Marshall secretly flew to the Albrook Air Force Base here and had a two-hour secret talk with Lieutenant General Crittenberger, commander of the Caribbean Defense Command, before leaving the area to continue flying to Washington. According to well-informed sources, Marshall's departure from Bogotá before the end of the Pan-American Conference does not indicate any serious new crisis in world affairs, but only that several important foreign policy decisions need Marshall's decision. Moreover, the main work of the conference has been completed, and Marshall also believes that there is no need to stay here for a long time. The Pan-American Conference is stepping up discussions on various major items and is expected to close in a week.</p>
<h3>To Implement the Trusteeship of Palestine, the US Invites Our Troops to Participate - The Security Council Establishes a Truce Committee to Supervise the Truce in the Holy Land</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Lake Success, 23rd, United Press] Chinese sources revealed that China is negotiating with the United States regarding the possible use of Chinese troops to implement the United Nations' trusteeship of Palestine. It is said that China has not yet rejected the United States' request. If China decides to provide troops for security in the Holy Land, it can only go together with troops from the United States and other countries. The negotiations between the United States and China are the same as those with other countries in the United Nations.</p>
<p>Senior Chinese sources said: They have not made China subject to any restrictions. They also revealed that the difficulty China felt regarding the United States' request was that it could not withdraw troops from the country in its anti-communist war. There is growing belief that Britain is preparing to unite with the United States to implement the trusteeship, but France will reject the United States' proposal. Open discussions on the Palestinian issue at the United Nations have stalled, and every important aspect of the issue is being dealt with in secret. The Political and Security Committee of the United Nations General Assembly has temporarily adjourned to allow representatives to study France's proposal, which suggests taking emergency steps to protect Jerusalem from the scourge of the Arab-Jewish war.</p>
<p>[United Press Washington, 23rd] According to informal but reliable sources on the 23rd, if the United Nations needs member states to help guard Palestine, the United States is most likely to provide a Marine Division, totaling 17,000 people, plus some naval vessels.</p>
<p>[United Press Lake Success, 23rd] British representative Jones spoke at the Political Committee of the United Nations General Assembly on the 23rd, avoiding directly answering the United States' request for Britain to send troops to implement the trusteeship of Palestine, but said that the United States' trusteeship plan should be "considered." The British spokesperson also admitted that negotiations between the United Kingdom and the United States are still ongoing, and the British cabinet is still discussing the final answer to the United States' request to send troops.</p>
<p>[United Press Lake Success, 24th] The United Nations Security Council passed a US proposal tonight to establish a committee to supervise the truce in Palestine, composed of representatives from three countries. The delegation will be composed of the US, French, and Belgian consuls in Jerusalem in order to begin work immediately. The resolution passed by a vote of eight to zero, with the Soviet Union, Colombia, and Ukraine abstaining. The Soviet Union and Ukraine attacked the United States for nothing more than trying to subvert the partition plan for Palestine. Soviet representative Gromyko said, "The United States is afraid that Palestine will not be chaotic. To succeed in seeking a truce, it is necessary to stop the tricks that are being carried out daily." But the Soviet Union did not exercise its veto power. Earlier, British representative Jones said in the Political Committee of the General Assembly that the conflict in the Holy Land had expanded into an open war, which, if not stopped, might endanger world peace. The United States should now abandon the final solution and allow the United Nations to concentrate its efforts on preventing the expansion of the war. US representative Austin then made a proposal in the Security Council.</p>
<h3>General Assembly Suspends Debate on the Palestine Issue</h3>
<p>Discussion of French Proposals to Begin Tomorrow</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Lake Success, 23rd] The General Assembly agreed today to suspend the general debate on the Palestine issue and first consider the French proposal, which advocates emergency measures to protect the walls and residents of Jerusalem. Chairman Jiang Tingfu announced that the Political Committee of the General Assembly will consider the French proposal on the 26th and temporarily postpone the general debate on the Palestine issue altogether. US and Australian representatives had also put forward proposals before France, but now they all agree to give priority to the French proposal. In the draft proposal, France only proposes that the General Assembly instruct the Trusteeship Council (in consultation with the trustee country and the relevant parties) to study the issue of protecting Jerusalem and take appropriate measures. It is generally believed that what France is seeking is to organize an international volunteer police force to serve in Jerusalem under the control of the Trusteeship Council. This proposal is likely to be opposed by the Soviet Union, because the Soviet Union has so far refused to participate in the Trusteeship Council. The Soviet representative has now notified the General Assembly that it will express its views on the French proposal at the meeting on the 26th.</p>
<h3>France Does Not Intend to Participate</h3>
<p>[Reuters Paris, 23rd] Sources say that the French government is very reluctant to participate in the joint control of Palestine under the auspices of the United Nations. France will maintain a neutral attitude in the Middle East to avoid causing resentment among the Muslim people of French North Africa.</p>
<h3>Britain Declares Again</h3>
<p>[Reuters Lake Success, 23rd] Britain today reiterated to the United Nations its decision to hand over Palestine on May 15 and to completely withdraw British troops from the Holy Land on August 1, and asked what to do with the Holy Land after the British withdrawal? British Colonial Minister Jones, in his address to the Political Committee of the General Assembly today, reiterated his previous statement and emphasized the importance of a truce. He said: Less than a month remains before Britain withdraws from Palestine. Time is obviously very pressing, and some resolutions must be obtained. Palestine is now in a state of administrative and social disintegration. After the trustee country withdraws, there is a danger of falling into anarchy and suicidal struggle.</p>
<h3>Haifa Gradually Calming Down - Jews Guarantee the Safe Withdrawal of Arabs - Syria Announces It Will Attack Palestine</h3>
<p>[Reuters Jerusalem, 23rd] The fighting in Haifa has almost completely stopped. Only a small part of the Arabs in the market area are still resisting.

<p>[Reuters Cairo, 23rd] According to reliable sources: King Ibn Saud of Saudi Arabia has sent a letter to the Political Committee of the Arab League supporting the proposal to send Jordanian troops to Palestine.</p>
<p>[Reuters Baghdad, 24th] The people of Baghdad and its suburbs, including student party representatives and trade union members, gathered today to petition the government, demanding that the army be sent immediately to aid the Arabs in Palestine.

<h3>Coal for Public Utilities; City Government Discusses Assistance with Transportation</h3>
<p>[Report from this Newspaper] In order to stabilize the prices of public utilities, the city government is working hard to reduce the prices of raw materials.

<h3>Special Criminal Court; Investigation of Cases to Begin Tomorrow; Court Address Too Small; Detention Center Too Far</h3>
<p>[Report from this Newspaper] The Special Criminal Court will begin investigating cases from tomorrow. A reporter visited Xu Shixian, the chief prosecutor of the court yesterday, and talked about the start of the court's work. According to him, there are five prosecutors in the establishment, but only three have arrived. Because there are more than 70 accumulated cases, they have been basically assigned to the three prosecutors. When the number of cases increases, he himself will also handle a part of them. However, the court address is small and there are too few investigation courts, which is not enough for use. The detention center downstairs can only accommodate dozens of people. Although a detention center has been found in the Nanshi area, the journey is too far and inconvenient to travel back and forth. As for the Wu Chao case and the Shanghai Xinjiu Factory workers' unrest case, which are of most concern to the public in this city, the former has been sent by the police bureau with a transfer letter. According to the regulations of the Special Criminal Law, the use of a transfer letter means that the evidence is considered clear, and its effect is equivalent to a public prosecution by the prosecutor, so no further investigation will be conducted, and it will be tried directly by the judge. The Shenxin No. 9 Factory case was sent with an investigation report, and the investigation will begin in the next few days. As for the trial work, it will be launched simultaneously after Court President Wang Zhennan returns to Shanghai from Fenghua.</p>

<h3>楊景周失踪案　有人投函本報詳述所見　神經已呈錯亂　認為投海身亡　臺方查明無被包圍情事</h3>
<p>Yang Jingzhou's Disappearance Case: Someone Submits a Letter to This Newspaper Detailing What They Saw; Nerves Already Deranged; Believed to Have Died by Drowning; Taiwanese Authorities Investigate and Find No Circumstances of Being Surrounded</p>
<p>[Reported by This Newspaper] Following the publication of the Yang Jingzhou disappearance case by this newspaper, a reader named Zhou Jianying sent a letter yesterday, believing that Yang had committed suicide by drowning. It was claimed: "I traveled from Taiwan to Shanghai with Mr. Yang. When Mr. Yang boarded the ship, his nerves were already deranged, and he spoke irrationally. Everyone said he was ill. On the day of sailing, there were large waves, and all the passengers on board were either dizzy and vomiting or unable to move freely. Only I was able to move freely on the ship. Around 2:00 PM, Mr. Yang was again talking nonsense, saying things like: 'I am not a bad person, I am actually requesting a cost of living index for the workers, instigated by the communists,' etc. ... Later, he even spoke a preamble to suicide. We thought he was mentally disturbed and ignored him. At around 4:00 PM, because everyone had taken all the places, I felt unable to support myself sitting and sleeping, and wanted to find a place to rest, but there was no space anywhere. Later, I found the place where Mr. Yang had been sleeping, but he was no longer there. We waited until dawn and he still had not returned. Everyone suspected. Later, looking at all the items in his leather bag, and seeing the words published in various newspapers in his diary, it was confirmed that he had died by drowning," etc. After receiving the letter yesterday, this reporter planned to visit Mr. Zhou for detailed inquiries, but when visiting the address written on the letter, "No. 12, Chengde Lane, Maierxi Avenue," there was no such person as Zhou Jianying. Furthermore, according to Yang Jingzhou's family, Yang had absolutely no mental illness in Shanghai, so if he was indeed mentally disturbed when boarding the ship, it must have been caused by stimulation in Taiwan.</p>
<p>[Reported by This Newspaper, Taipei, 24th] Regarding the Yang Jingzhou disappearance case, the Keelung Port Police Bureau reported to the Provincial Police Department today that before boarding the ship, including during his stay in Keelung City and at the port, Yang did not encounter any encirclement or have his ticket robbed. As for whether he bought a ticket on board, it will only be confirmed after the Minzhong Steamer arrives.</p>

<h3>薛衡之被捕　因洩漏軍機　曾人某師政訓主任　作戰失利一度被俘</h3>
<p>Xue Hengzhi Arrested for Leaking Military Secrets; Formerly Served as Political Training Director of a Certain Division; Captured Once After Operational Failure</p>
<p>[Reported by This Newspaper] This newspaper reported yesterday that Xue Hengzhi, a senior staff member of the Fuel Management Committee of the Ministry of Economic Affairs, was arrested by the Garrison Command on suspicion of involvement in a case. Zhang Xihui, the director of the Fuel Management Committee, told this newspaper's reporter that Xue Hengzhi was introduced to the committee by someone on December 12th of last year and served as a specialist. Recently, because Shen Yunlong, the chief secretary of the committee, went to Beijing to attend the National Assembly Representatives Conference, Xue temporarily acted as the chief secretary, serving for only four months in total. As for Xue's arrest and interrogation by the Garrison Command, it was due to a case involving Xue during his tenure in a certain agency four months ago. Rumors of corruption are unconfirmed by me. However, it has nothing to do with the Fuel Management Committee. Later, this newspaper's reporter learned from other reliable sources that Xue is from Wujin, Jiangsu. He previously served as the political training director in a certain division of the National Army. Later, in a battle in a certain place in Shandong, he was defeated by the bandits and unfortunately captured. He did not escape until November and then came to Shanghai, where he was introduced by a friend to work in the Fuel Management Committee. However, it is heard that there were more than ten people who escaped from the bandit area with Xue this time. For some unknown reason, several of them secretly reported to the Ministry of National Defense that Xue was suspected of leaking important military secrets to the bandits. Therefore, the Ministry of National Defense telegraphed the Municipal Garrison Command to send two plainclothes officers to the Fuel Management Committee on the morning of the 23rd to arrest Xue. It is said that he will be sent to Beijing for interrogation within days.</p>

<h3>五六月間財政　未可樂觀</h3>
<p>Finances in May and June Not Optimistic</p>
<p>[Reported by This Newspaper] The municipal government has been ordered to issue salaries and allowances to public education personnel in the city for April at 240,000 times.

Tax revenue for April has so far reached more than 300 billion. Comparing revenue and expenditure, April can barely be survived. However, the salaries and allowances of publicly funded personnel need to be adjusted once a month from now on, and except for business, slaughter, banquet, and music taxes, which can be adjusted ad valorem, all other tax rates are fixed.

<p>[Reported by This Newspaper] Zhu Bing, the general manager of the Xinsui Company, who has been repeatedly accused of fraud, was sentenced yesterday in the District Court Detention Center for the fifth fraud case he was accused of. The facts of this case are that 24 paper companies in the city, including Minghua, Huakang, and Xingzhong, ordered more than 26,000 reams of Soviet newsprint from Zhu. At that time, they paid Zhu more than 3 billion yuan in deposits. Afterwards, Zhu was unable to deliver the goods, so Zhu compensated a portion of the money and issued checks from the Central Cooperative Treasury for 880 million yuan. However, when they were cashed, they were returned due to insufficient funds. Minghua and others then sued Zhu for fraud. Yesterday, Judge Mei Erhe pronounced the sentence: "Zhu Bing, jointly and continuously intending to illegally possess himself, used fraudulent means to cause others to deliver their own property, sentenced to one year of imprisonment, and when issuing the checks, intentionally exceeded the amount of deposits, fined 200 million yuan. If the fine is converted to labor, the total amount of the fine shall be converted into the number of days for six months. Other incidental civil suits shall be transferred to the Civil Court for handling. The company's staff members Shi Wenzhang and Wang Furong are not guilty."</p>
<h3>經濟警察犯法　串吞銀樓飾金　假搜查黑市交易為由舞弊　案發移送地檢處偵查</h3>
<p>Economic Police Break the Law; Collude to Embezzle Jewelry Gold from Jewelry Store; Abuse Power Under the Pretense of Investigating Black Market Transactions; Case Transferred to the District Procuratorate for Investigation</p>
<p>[Reported by This Newspaper] Cotton yarn broker Wu Haida knew economic policeman Zhang Lin. He heard Zhang say that if someone reported black market gold and currency transactions, they could get 30% of the bonus after the case was cracked. Wu, tempted by the benefit, discussed it with his friends Zhou Yunshan and Zhou Yunkuang. Zhou's brother-in-law, Shao Xingnan, was a clerk in the Telecommunications Bureau. He heard his colleagues Xiang Xiuquan and Zhou Jingwei talk about how the Baokang Jewelry Store on Xinzha Road was doing black market gold and currency trading. Shao told Wu and Zhou. Then Zhou Yunshan, using the pseudonym Zhou Zhen, reported to the Economic Police Brigade. On February 24, Economic Police Squad Leader Wang Shuci led police officers Zhang Lin and Gao Rucheng, as well as the informants, to search the Baokang Jewelry Store, No. 19 Zunrang Lane, Xiamen Road, and No. 14 Dongxiang Dian Lane, Da Road. They found 41 taels of gold bars and more than 270 million yuan in paper currency in Baokang's safe. They also found more than 100 taels of jewelry gold in a wooden box. At that time, the jewelry store argued reasonably that jewelry gold could not be used for black market trading by law and requested its return. Squad Leader Wang had already agreed, but Zhang Lin, Wu Haida, Zhou Yunshan, and others, seeing an opportunity, falsely claimed that they had found 30 taels of jewelry gold and took it to the bureau for investigation. The jewelry store handed over 30 taels of jewelry gold and gold bars to Wu to take away. The next day, they handed over the gold bars to the bureau, while they privately divided the jewelry gold. Zhang Lin and Gao Rucheng, fearing that the case would be exposed, asked for leave on the grounds of illness. Later, the police bureau became suspicious when Zhang and others did not return after a long absence. They summoned the Baokang Jewelry Store for questioning. After it was revealed that Zhang and others had acted corruptly, Zhang Lin and Gao Rucheng were dismissed, and Squad Leader Wang Shuci was detained. They were transferred to the District Procuratorate for investigation on charges of fraud. The court opened yesterday. Except for Qiang Lin and Gao Rucheng, who were on the run, all the above-mentioned suspects were present in court. The result was that Wang was still ordered to be detained, and the others were released on bail.</p>

<h3>Textile Factories Relocating South, The Consequences Are Worthy of Attention</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] Domestic industries have recently been relocating to Hong Kong one after another, which has attracted great attention from all parties. According to the opinion of a certain authoritative economic expert yesterday, the cotton textile industry has the greatest relationship with the national economy among the industries relocating to Hong Kong. It is reported that since last summer, six new cotton spinning factories have been established in Hong Kong. All the spindles have reached 120,000. The total capital has reached about HK$110 million. Except for Nanyang, which is a Sino-British joint venture, the rest are all Chinese capital. Recently, there are still two companies under preparation. Such a huge amount of capital flowing to Hong Kong will inevitably help to tighten Hong Kong's exchange rate. These yarn factories can produce 7,200 pieces of yarn per month, which is enough to meet the needs of Hong Kong's knitting and weaving industries. In the future, they can also be sold in Southeast Asia after expansion. Therefore, after the development of Hong Kong's cotton textile industry, our country's export of yarn and cloth will be greatly affected. Foreign exchange income will inevitably decrease. On the one hand, the domestic cotton yarn production will decrease, and the yarn price will be even more difficult to suppress. Looking forward to the future, it is very worrying, and I hope the government will pay attention. It is also reported that Hong Kong's raw cotton supply comes from India. The local wages are also very expensive, and it is really not an environment for the development of the cotton textile industry, and it will be difficult to maintain it permanently. At this moment, various industries are relocating to Hong Kong, aiming to escape domestic control. I don't know that the implementation of control in China is necessary due to the lack of foreign exchange and materials. Today, capital is escaping, making the lack of foreign exchange and materials even more severe, which is really not worthy of sympathy.</p>
<p>[This newspaper's Nanjing 24th dispatch] Since the implementation of import controls, Shanghai factories have been facing difficulties in the supply of raw materials, and the power supply is intermittent, coupled with the rising prices and the increase in the cost of living. Therefore, most factories have plans to relocate to Hong Kong. According to the person in charge of the Ministry of Economic Affairs, the Ministry has also heard of this kind of rumors, but the number does not seem to be very large. The Ministry is closely investigating and paying attention to the actual situation. If the number of factories relocating to Hong Kong increases, the outflow of funds, the reduction of production, and the unemployment of workers will adversely affect my country's industry. There are many reasons for the relocation of factories to Hong Kong, and the difficulty in obtaining quota foreign exchange is the most important one. The Ministry has always paid great attention to relieving the difficulties suffered by the manufacturers, but if the allocation of quota foreign exchange can be improved, the difficulties will be easier to overcome.</p>
<h3>Qinxing Capital Increase</h3>
<p>The factory's shareholders' extraordinary meeting on April 4 decided to send two and recognize three, that is, each old share can get five shares by paying 30 yuan in cash, and a total of six shares including the original share. The factory's original capital was 13.44 billion yuan, and the newly added capital was 67.2 billion yuan, making a total of 80.64 billion yuan.</p>
<h3>Bank of China Shareholders' Meeting, Re-elect Commercial Share Directors</h3>

<h3>The Export Promotion Office of the Transportation and Export Management Committee Formulated Two More Handling Principles</h3>

<h3>Smuggling Exports Are Still Extremely Rampant, The Overseas Tung Oil Market Is Weak</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] According to the China Trust Bureau's Barter Department, the overseas tung oil market continued to weaken this week. The spot price in New York is US$0.245 per pound, while the US importers are selling futures for only US$0.2375 per pound, which proves that there must be other ways to obtain tung oil. 3,000 tons of goods arrived in New York last week, while very little has been shipped from Shanghai recently, and the price of oil in South China continues to increase, which all proves that the smuggling of tung oil exports is still extremely rampant. It is recently reported that a large number of tung oil in Guangdong Province is smuggled from Kaiping through Haikou, and it is hoped that the relevant departments will find ways to stop it. The overseas pig bristle market is stable and popular.</p>
<p>[Another dispatch] Since the China Trust Bureau adjusted the purchase price of tung oil on Monday this week, the purchase price is still about 20% different from the black market price, so it is still impossible to collect it in this city this week. The purchase price review committee will convene a meeting tomorrow to discuss it again.</p>

If the students have factual evidence to present, the Municipal Government is still willing to continue investigating thoroughly. (2) Regarding the issue of entering the university to conduct searches, the Municipal Government has long ordered the police局 not to enter the university without special orders.

<h3>An Interlude Amidst the Strike: Professor's Casual Remarks Provoke Student Rebuttal</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] Some students at Fudan University went on strike yesterday to protest the illegal search incident by unidentified individuals a few days ago. Today is Sunday, and classes may resume tomorrow. However, yesterday morning, amidst the strike, a new incident of conflict between students and a professor occurred. Professor Pan Zhenya of the law department at the university was unaware of the students' decision to strike and still went to school yesterday morning as usual to teach. In the first period "General Principles of Civil Law" class, because there were only four students in class, Professor Pan intended to stop teaching the regular course and switch to "casual remarks" to avoid the trouble of making up classes for other striking students in the future. This aroused the opposition of the students in class, who insisted on having the regular class taught. The wording was inevitably excessive, and Mr. Pan considered it an insult to teachers and "hindrance to academic freedom," so he left in anger and demanded that the Dean of Students punish the four students. Subsequently, the Law Society also argued that the professor had been insulted and made the same request. By yesterday afternoon, student groups posted notices criticizing the university's previous strikes and the fact that Professor Pan had participated in and supported this strike. After this new incident occurred, Mr. He Dehe, the Dean of Students, did not express an opinion, waiting for President Zhang Yi to return to the university to handle it. On the side of the striking students, yesterday afternoon, they went to Jiaotong University and St. John's University to report on the incident.</p>

<h3>Students of Hebei Institute of Technology Pass Through Shanghai to Petition in Beijing to Recover Pre-War School Buildings</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] Students from the Hebei Provincial Institute of Technology in Tianjin have been on strike since the 15th of this month to recover pre-war school property. The president of the institute, Lu Yinteng, is currently in Beijing lobbying, but there have been no results. The students also sent representatives Zhang Wanjun, Lü Zhigan, and others to pass through Shanghai last night to petition in Beijing. According to reports, the institute's pre-war school property includes two locations for the main campus and branch campus. The main campus has important equipment such as a hydraulic engineering laboratory, a textile museum, a chemical plant, a tannery, a paper mill, and a physics and chemistry laboratory. During the war, it was occupied by the enemy's wounded soldiers' hospital. After the victory, it was taken over by the Tianjin Rear General Hospital of the Combined Service Headquarters. Negotiations have been ongoing, but it has not been possible to recover it. Currently, the institute is facing a serious shortage of buildings. More than 600 students are crammed into a single branch campus, even the auditorium and boiler room are temporarily used for living, which is overcrowded. After the summer enrollment, the number of students will increase further, and the lack of housing will affect the hiring of professors. After organizing a committee to recover school property and appealing without results, the students went on strike on the 15th and organized a petition group to go to Beijing, submitting petitions to the Ministry of Education in Nanjing, the Beiping Executive Headquarters, the Hebei Provincial Government, and the Provincial Assembly.

<h3>On Mutual Assistance</h3>
<p>— Wu Yong</p>
<p>"Heaven helps those who help themselves"—this sentence can only be used as a slogan to encourage people to be independent, but it cannot be used as an excuse to refuse to help those in danger. There should be no inferiority of dependence between people, but everyone must have the psychology of mutual assistance.</p>
<p>But if we want to get help from others, we must first help others, just as if you want others to love you, you must first love others. When we fail in our careers and come to the end of the road, we often say things like "people are indifferent" and "the world is cold," but we have to ask ourselves: Have we never had an indifferent attitude in our dealings with people? The saying "Rely on your parents at home, rely on your friends when you go out" does not mean that we should have a psychology of dependence on friends, but rather indicates the attitude we should have towards friends. We should not expect anything in return when we help others; but if you help others, they will naturally come to help you, this is a certain truth. Therefore, Mr. Xiong once said: "Heaven helps those who help others."</p>
<p>I once read an article in a Western magazine about "sacrificing oneself to help others." The article described an American paratrooper who landed in the German defense line in France during World War II. In order to avoid being captured by the Germans, he asked a French woman to protect him; this woman readily agreed to hide the paratrooper in her wardrobe, but soon the Germans found him, and the Germans immediately arrested the French woman's husband and shot him in the open space in front of the door. The paratrooper managed to escape while being escorted to the camp. German soldiers were chasing behind him. The paratrooper looked around, and there was no other place to hide except the French woman's house; the paratrooper tiptoed back to the house. He saw the body of the French man who had been shot by the German soldiers still lying in the open space in front of the door, and the French woman was standing at the door crying. He went forward and asked her to protect him again. The woman readily agreed again, without any difficulty. The paratrooper was thus saved. This French woman understood the righteousness and can be said to understand the true meaning of mutual assistance. This kind of behavior is the most noble manifestation of the spirit of mutual assistance.</p>
<p>However, since Darwin advocated the theory of "survival of the fittest," some scholars have believed that helping the poor and weak hinders the evolution of human beings. The English scholar Spencer is one of them. In his "Study of Sociology," he said: "By the practice of natural selection, the creator eliminates those who are incompetent, and everyone is responsible for their own independence, and their group will prosper; but the ignorant use tenderness to destroy the work of heaven, so that they cannot have the effect of advancing the group." His intention is that society is a battlefield, the winners are the excellent ones, and the losers are the bad elements, which is a natural elimination process; if we help the weak, it will not be beneficial to the evolution of society, but harmful. This kind of statement is not only too cruel, but according to this reasoning, those cruel elements in society who only care about their own private interests and do not care about the life or death of others should be the backbone of the human group, and those who hold the spirit of sacrificing oneself to save others are fools. Just as Spencer himself said: "To the fullest extent, all things that suppress the strong, forbid the tyrannical, and prevent fraud are all permissible, why? Because all of these are to save those who cannot save themselves and protect those who cannot protect themselves, all of these will allow the weak and inferior people to survive and extend their descendants. And to extend the discussion, medical techniques and strategies can not be discussed, and dangers can not be prevented, why? Because they all hone the quality of the people, so that they finally reach the strongest, and make those who are not suitable have no surviving species." I ask, is there such a reason in the world?</p>
<p>It must be known that mutual assistance is also one of the most necessary conditions in the struggle for survival. Kropotkin, the author of "Mutual Aid: A Factor of Evolution", said well: "In the animal kingdom, forward development is parallel to mutual assistance, and backward steps are accompanied by mutual quarrels among animals. In the case of human beings, two conflicting countries, cities, parties, or tribes, when they fight each other, the victors always belong to the side that is very capable of mutual assistance internally."</p>
<h3>Dawn on the Lake</h3>
<p>— Lei Hong</p>
<p>The boat is next to the foot of "Zhongdu Mountain," and the surroundings on the lake are so dark that nothing can be seen. Fortunately, there is a crescent moon, illuminating the mountain path, climbing the steps, entering a wall, looking for a small path among the bushes, and climbing up, a spacious house is built on the mountainside, this is the Zuile Hall of Xiaopenglaishan Hall, where we are staying.</p>
<p>A kerosene lamp is hung inside the house, which is the only light in the mountains. Looking out over the lake from here, with the help of the weak moonlight, it is possible to vaguely identify a distant mountain. And the surroundings are quiet, and the rustling sound of the waves hitting the shore can also be heard. A wild dog is kept on the mountain, barking madly at strangers, which is the only rebel who breaks through the tourists' whispers and is uneasy with loneliness.</p>
<p>We had dinner and went to sleep to watch the dawn rise in the morning. Most of the tourists could not sleep well, finding the old woman to ask for tea and water. The old woman, while preparing tea and water, chatted with the tourists, and it was not until after twelve o'clock that it was deep and quiet, and everyone went to sleep.</p>
<p>I slept until 4:30 in the morning, and could no longer close my eyes, so I got dressed and got up. The old woman had already gotten up refreshed to prepare tea and water for the tourists. At this time, the sky was slightly dawn, and there were already two or three cloth sails moving slowly on the lake. There was a line of dawn in the east, which was a touch of red glow in the gray sky. The south is Yuantouzhu, which is shrouded in thick fog, and the houses and trees cannot be distinguished.</p>
<p>The place of the red glow gradually released golden light, and the rising sun was so dazzlingly red, like God tearing his arm and sprinkling dots of blood in the lead-gray sky. The rising of the initial sun is very amazing, and in just two or three minutes, a "crescent-shaped" sun has appeared, and the surrounding clouds are becoming more and more bright. The four sides are dawn, and looking at the fog on the opposite mountain, it is still lingering in a circle, staying on the top of the mountain and reluctant to leave.</p>
<p>The sun rose again, and in less than ten minutes, it had completely emerged. A breeze blew from the face, so the mountains were green and the water was clear, and the cloth sail attached to the distance looked so stable, as if it would not be disturbed by the world.</p>
<p>The red-tiled foreign houses in the south, mixed in the green trees, are illuminated by the sun, and they are even more brilliant as a painting.</p>
<h3>Lin Baishui, Shao Piaoping, Zhang Hanjü</h3>
<p>— Yi Yun</p>
<p>In the old days of Beiping during the warlord era, freedom of speech was extremely restricted, and journalists were in danger of being killed if they were not careful. Lin Baishui, the chief of the Social Daily, liked to make jokes in his editorials, and his newspaper sold well because of this. When Huang Fu was in power, he often mocked and ridiculed him. When the Zhili-Lu army rose up, he occasionally quoted the "Miscellaneous Secrets," a blasphemous phrase, joking and close to abuse, and finally touched the anger of the warlord, and he was arrested and killed. It is said that when he was arrested, he wrote a will, the first sentence of which was "My life is at stake," which is sad.</p>
<p>At the same time, Shao Piaoping of the Jingbao died after Lin. It was heard that after Lin's change, he had been hiding in Jiaominxiang, not daring to go out easily. Gu's concubine was at home, and there was a fierce quarrel with his wife. He was very eager to return, so he called Zhang Hanjü, a colleague, to inquire. Zhang strongly said that there was no harm. Shao believed him, and as soon as his car left Jiaominxiang, he was arrested and killed. Shao liked to dress up, his clothes were beautiful, and even at the age of not惑, he was still as handsome as a young man. When he spoke to people, his voice was extremely low and harmonious. If the newspaper's funds were occasionally depleted, he would pawn his clothes to fill the gap, which was quite pleasing to his colleagues. Many people regretted his death.</p>
<p>Zhang Hanjü, whose name was Peng, was nicknamed "Night叉 Zhang San." At that time, he was representing a certain garrison commander as a journalist, and he was very powerful, so Shao wanted to go out, and he first called Zhang to decide. He was actually misled. In fact, Zhang's men had long been monitored by secret reports. As soon as Zhang Zongchang arrived, he would die after Lin Shao, but Zhang did not know it. Fortunately, Li, the chief of police, had an old relationship with Zhang. When Zongchang was about to arrive, Li Daoying was on the special car, and when he spoke about Zhang's affairs, Li laughed and said, He is the so-called Night叉 Zhang San, the marshal's bullets are precious, it is a pity to shoot a Night叉. The language was extremely humorous, Zongchang laughed, and Zhang was spared. The next year, a certain famous actor's house suddenly came to a violent guest, extorting a huge sum of money. Zhang helped to deal with it, but he was shot and killed. Zhang did not die in the newspaper, but died at the hands of a violent guest, which was also Zhang's misfortune.</p>
<h3>Little Raindrops</h3>
<p>— Shi Jimei</p>
<p>The most pathetic people in the world are those with the most prejudices. But a person without prejudice is unlovable.</p>
<p>Have you read Wilde's prose poems? He tells us that "temporary happiness" is made of "eternal sorrow."</p>
<p>The strongest memory of mankind is God's most cruel arrangement.</p>
<p>Lying is a beautiful art, but also a dangerous game.</p>
<p>A person without imagination is a fool; a person with too much imagination is a madman.</p>
<p>Time is water, it has washed away the color of how much powder and rouge.</p>
<h3>Kunming Bamboo Branch Lyrics</h3>
<p>— Bi Jue</p>
<p>The Golden Horse Archway faces the Emerald Chicken, That man's workshop is north, and the concubine's workshop is west. They look at each other every morning but can't meet, Crows crow every day and night in the workshop.</p>
<p>All day long rowing a boat by the side of the Haizi (Dian people call Cui Lake the vegetable Haizi, and its surroundings are called Haizi side), Apricot-red shirt and emerald hairpin, They say they are not as good as dragonflies, They can sleep in the depths of the lotus flower.</p>
<p>The Western Hills are easy to set, and the setting sun slants, Not seeing the returning sails, returning alone, The camellia on the head is still red, Pairs of canyon butterflies fly beside people.</p>
<p>The carp under the fish pond are fat, The stream girl sits beside the old man fishing, Getting up early to pick fish to sell at the foot of the mountain, The setting sun helps the drunk to return.</p>
<p>The weeping willow in the corner of the house sleeps on the ground, Our family (Dian people call people you, call themselves self or our family) lives in front of Caohu (Dianchi is also known as Qingcao Lake), The tide water in front of the door is thousands of feet deep, Where is the man at the head of the tide?</p>
<h3>Inducing Jade</h3>
<p>— He Tianjian</p>
<p>I recently participated in a cherry blossom viewing party and wrote two poems, which were disclosed in this publication; for a time, replies and simple letters came in, and it has not stopped so far. The number of people is as many as forty or fifty, and the region is as wide as from this city and Nantong to Nanjing and Hangzhou, and perhaps it may extend to other places, which is a grand event.</p>
<p>Although I like poetry all my life, I regret that it is not skilled. I only occasionally use rhymes because of my emotions; and the poems of all the gentlemen that I have obtained this time are exceptionally exquisite, and Gao Qingqiu said that poetry must emphasize intention, style, and rhyme. The poems of all the gentlemen are truly sincere and lively, the style is high and peaceful, and the rhyme is secluded and bright. My throwing a brick to attract jade, I did not expect to see it here! Is it not a great pleasure in fifty years!</p>
<p>The cherry blossom viewing party was held by the local chief executive, and its significance is not only to share happiness with the people, but also to promote the essence of national culture, and poetry is the best way to inspire emotions. In theory, a publication should be published so that the works can be collected into a book as a memorial. If this is done every year, it will be beneficial to the people of the country to learn from the past and be vigilant, but I have not heard of any such measures, what can I do!</p>
<p>I returned home yesterday from visiting the tomb, so I took the opportunity to go to Yixing to climb Tumo Mountain and the highest West Shen Mountain in my hometown. At that time, I did not feel tired, but I did not expect that two days later, my toothache was like a sting, and my body was as hot as a fire, which was caused by the wind and heat inside. While lying in bed, I read the poems of all the gentlemen, recited them in cycles, and was infinitely happy. How can I make the efforts of all the gentlemen not be wasted? I am trying to find a way to reply to each one, but because my physical strength still needs to be recovered, I cannot use my brain power too much. I will gradually respond, fortunately, all the gentlemen have addresses, so I take this opportunity to thank you.</p>
<h3>A Father's Appointment</h3>
<p>— Ge Chunliang</p>
<p>——This story was told to me by a friend of mine. Now that he has passed away, I feel it's okay to share it...</p>
<p>This story took place in a charming Dutch inn, which catered specifically to travelers. At the time, my father and I were traveling together, enjoying ourselves immensely.</p>
<p>"It's a pity your mother couldn't come," Father said, "taking her around would surely make her happy."</p>
<p>He had been to Holland in his younger days. I asked him, "How many years ago were you here?"</p>
<p>"Hmm, probably thirty years ago. I remember being in this inn too..." He looked around, searching for his memories. "Those were beautiful days—" He suddenly stopped speaking. I saw his face turn pale. I followed his gaze and saw a woman carrying a tray, serving wine to customers. She must have been beautiful once, but now she was stout and her hair was unkempt. "Do you know her?" I asked.</p>
<p>"I used to," he said.</p>
<p>The woman came to our table and rudely asked, "Drinking?"</p>
<p>"Beer," I said. The woman nodded and left.</p>
<p>"She's changed so much! Thank goodness she didn't recognize me," Father muttered, wiping the sweat from his face with a handkerchief. "Before I met your mother, I knew her," he continued. "Back then, I was a student, traveling. She was a lovely young woman, very dignified and noble. I fell madly in love with her, and she loved me too."</p>
<p>"Does Mother know her?" I blurted out, not very pleased.</p>
<p>"Of course," Father said gently.</p>
<p>He looked at me with some trepidation, and I felt a little embarrassed for him.</p>
<p>I said, "Dad, you really don't have to tell me—"</p>
<p>"Oh, I want to tell you. I don't want you to misinterpret. Her father was against our love. I was a foreigner with no future or prospects, relying on my father's support. I wrote to my father saying I wanted to get married, and he immediately cut off my allowance. So, I had to go home. But I met with the young woman one last time and told her I was going back to America to borrow money to get married, and that I would return in a few months to meet her."</p>
<p>He continued, "We knew her father might intercept the letters, so we agreed that I would just send her a slip of paper with a date written on it. On that day, she would come to a prearranged place to meet me, and we would get married. Ah, so I went home to borrow money and sent her that date."</p>
<p>"And then what?" I asked.</p>
<p>"She received the note. She wrote back saying, 'I will definitely be there.' But she didn't come. Later, I found out that she had gotten married two weeks earlier, to a local hotel owner. She didn't wait for me."</p>
<p>Then, my father said, "Thank God she didn't come. I went home, met your mother, and we have been very happy ever since. We often joke about that ridiculous love story."</p>
<p>The woman brought our beer.</p>
<p>"Are you from America?" she asked me.</p>
<p>"Yes," I said.</p>
<p>Her face lit up and she said, "America, a lovely place!"</p>
<p>"Yes, many people from your country go to America to seek their fortunes. Do you want to go too?"</p>
<p>"I'm not going. Definitely not now!" she said. "There was a time when I thought about it, long, long ago. But I stayed here. It's better here." We finished our beer and walked out.</p>
<p>Outside, I said, "Father, how did you write the date for your appointment?"</p>
<p>He stopped, took out an envelope, and wrote 12/71/13 on it. "Like this," he said, "12/11/13. Twelve, eleven, thirteen; of course! Meaning December eleventh, in nineteen thirteen."</p>
<p>"No!" I exclaimed. "That's how Americans write it, but not in Denmark or any other European country. Here, they write the day first, then the month. So, the date you wrote wasn't December eleventh, but November twelfth!"</p>
<p>Father covered his face with his hands and said, "Ah, so she did go!" He cried out, "It was because I didn't show up that she waited for me in vain and went off to marry someone else." He was silent for a moment. "Ah," he said, "I hope she's happy here. She seems happy!"</p>
<p>As we continued our stroll, I said, "It's lucky that's how it happened, or you wouldn't have met Mother."</p>
<p>He put his arm around my shoulders, a warm smile on his face, and said, "Son, I feel doubly lucky! Because, otherwise, I wouldn't have met you either!"</p>
