<h3>總統頒令改革幣制　發行金圓劵廿億元　金銀外幣禁流通或持有</h3>
<p>〔中央社南京十九日電〕總統十九日以命令頒布有關財政·經濟之重要辦法四件及財政·經濟緊急處分令，原文如下：</p>
<p>總統命令，茲依動員戡亂時期臨時條款之規定，經行政院會議之決議頒布財政·經濟緊急處分令，其要旨如左：</p>
<p>（一）自即日起以金圓為本位幣，十足準備發行金圓劵，限期收兌已發行之法幣及東北流通券。</p>
<p>（二）限期收兌人民所有黃金·白銀·銀幣及外國幣劵，逾期任何人不得持有。</p>
<p>（三）限期登記管理本國人民存放國外之外匯資產，違者予以制裁。</p>
<p>（四）整理財政並加強管制經濟以穩定物價，平衡國家總預算及國際收支。</p>
<p>基於上開要旨，特制定（一）金圓券發行辦法，（二）人民所有金銀外幣處理辦法，（三）中華民國人民存放國外外匯資產登記管理辦法，（四）整理財政及加强管制經濟辦法與本令同時公布，各該辦法視同本令之一部份，並授權行政院，對於各該辦法頒布必要之規程或補充辦法，以利本令之實施此令。</p>
<p>〔本報南京十九日電〕總統所頒財政·經濟緊急處分命令，首先於十九日下午三時舉行之國民黨中央政治委會中提出討論，並獲通過，該會由蔣總裁親自主持，翁院長文灝提出報吿，財長王雲五亦出席中政會報吿，會中討論詳盡，達三小時之久，於下午六時廿分始畢，會畢後各，委員均保守秘密，惟旋即由翁氏携該方案至政院，提出於政務委會中討論，歷時達三小時，至下午九時四十分始畢，該案即宣告通過，並決定自即日起實施。</p>
<p>〔本報南京十九日電〕全國人士矚目已久寄望極深之新經濟改革方案及幣制改革問題，終於十九日下午三時及六時先後舉行之國民黨中央政治委會及臨時政務委會中獲致通過，並經總統依據憲法動員戡亂臨時條款之規定，頒布財政經濟緊急處分令以施行，以之管制金融·疏導物資，而收安定市塲之效。命令中以改革幣制爲首要，以十足之準備發行金元券及其金屬性輔幣，以收回法幣，重建健全之幣制，金元劵乃有其充足之準備，在該命令中確切規定國府現存之黄金，白銀及外幣爲準備金之百分之四十，其餘則爲保證準備，堪稱充足之準備，自可達成即將通行之金元券之幣値穩定，同時金元券發行數業已加以硬性限制，不超過廿億元，革除今日以往之漫無止境之發行，在信用上應更能爲新幣之基礎穩固。其次，在命令中規定發行公開，由政府與社會人士共組發行準備監理委會，以監督發行數量，並嚴格檢査，隨時公布，此項能增强人民堅定信心之舉，爲過去發行通貨時所無者，按此項方案係經翁院長及有關人士縝密硏究，通盤籌劃之結果。其次，關於金元券與法幣及美鈔·銀元之比率，均能以規行市價爲參照，故在改革之初，將無重大影響。其餘如「人民存在外國資產登記及管理辦法」，「整理財政加强管制金融辦法」，前者係全國與論界及民意機構抨擊甚久，而遲未獲得解決者。後者爲目前若干問題，因幣制改革引起之現實事宜，均經訂定辦法，如公務人員之待遇及公用事業之穩定價格等等，均將有良好之發展，此項命令之公布，使若干人認爲在財政上可作久違之計劃與打算。</p>

<h3>物價有下跌趨勢　滬蘇鎮江一帶人心振奮</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕幣制改革消息於昨晚傳至本市覆，街頭巷尾，立成談話主題。金融界負責人士因未獲辦法全文，對此舉採取保留態度，並認爲若干按術上措施之是否得當，與幣制改革之成敗，頗有關係。般認爲政府之毅然改革幣制，必已在外匯及準備方面，具有相當把握，而幣制改革成功之前提，節爲十足之準備金。以此舉對於物價之影響而言，一般認爲輕度之混亂，殆不可避免，但因銀錢業之休假，市面將缺乏現鈔，同時有關當局勢必採取嚴厲之配合措施，物價短期內將有下跌之趨勢。</p>
<p>〔本報無錫十九日電〕改革幣制消息到錫時，已在晚間九時以後，故商業方面未見有若何影響，惟一般心理皆欲購貨，但因晚間各業皆已閉市，故無物可買。</p>
<p>〔本報蘇州十九日電〕改革偕制消息傳到蘇州後，市上頓呈興奮而混亂狀態，人心虛軟，各物均跌，銀錢業舉行緊急會議，決議停業二天，廿三日開關。</p>
<p>〔本報鎭江十九日電〕今晚政府決實施經濟改革方案之消息由京滬傳達此間後，因鎭商塲晚市交易寥寥，市場反應尚徵，惟一般人心因新經濟方案對穩定物價必能發生良好效果，極表振舊。</p>
<p>〔本報北平十九日電〕全國各銀行錢荘自廿日起放假二日令到後，平市場百物狂跌，綠陽光市布由一億五百萬遽跌爲八八〇〇萬。</p>
<h3>張羣明赴日晤麥帥　交換整個遠東局勢意見</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕張羣偕夫人，已於昨日午後一時搭錢塘號車自京抵滬，將於廿一日飛日本，作短期考察。</p>
<p>〔合衆社東京十九日電〕東京美國高級官員方面對張羣訪日之行極感興趣。張氏諒可於本週杪抵日，抵日後不久諒將訪晤麥克阿塞元帥。據悉：麥帥正在期待張羣將軍之來臨，幷準備與其交換整個遠東局勢之意見。張氏之訪日名義上雖屬私人性質；但似可確定者，渠將爲此間視作蔣總統之代表，而受切合身份之待遇。在若干方面，張氏之訪日，與陳立夫之訪美有相似之處。此間均信，杜威本屆當可當選，而杜威政府之外交政策中，將包括竭力支持中國政府殲滅共黨軍隊之企圖。此間一般認爲：預料杜威之當選，蔣總統諒在等待陳立夫與張羣關於美國共和黨諸領袖態度之詳細報吿。</p>
<h3>夏威主皖　張軫主豫</h3>
<p>中政會昨已法定</p>
<p>〔本報南京十九日電〕夏威主院省政，張軫主豫省政，兩人事任免案已經十九日中政會決定。</p>

<p>社論</p>
<h3>幣制已實行改革了</h3>
<p>改革幣制的意見，向分兩派：一主立卽改革，以爲幣制不先改革，經濟决不會穩定；一主先行準備，俟條件具備，時機成熟，方可着手改革，否則另一形式的新法幣，代替了現行的法幣，於國計民生，並無裨益。</p>
<p>於改革方案之中，對於新幣本位的意見，尤多參差；我國人的見解，大多數側重於管理通貨，卽有計劃的紙幣本位。理由是回復硬幣，不論是金是銀，已不適於時代潮流，我國又非產金產銀之國，而鑄造足量的硬幣，更非短期間內所可藏事。</p>
<p>今幣制改革的方案，並經總統明令，發行金圓券等辦法四種，已於昨日中央政治會議及行政院政務會議先後通過了，其大要爲（一）採用金本位，新幣四元，折合美金一元，法幣三百萬元，折合新幣一元；（二）黄金收回國有，銀元亦由政府收回，其價定爲新幣兩元折合銀元一元。這項措置，已解决了以上兩項問題，而改革的時期問題與本位問題，不可謂非大刀關斧，當機立斷。此在我國經濟史上，値得大書特書的一件事。</p>
<p>所謂法幣三百萬元折合新幣一元一節，不免要令人回想到僞幣二百折合法幣一元這一件事。但以新帶四元，折合美金一元而論，其興最近外滙黑市，相去並不甚遠，卽實際並無多大損失，且與美金密切聯繫，規定此率，其價値可望從此鞏固，這與僞幣折合法幣的情形又完全不同。所以新幣四元折合美金一元這一點，如果能確切維持，始終不稍變動，則凡特有法幣的人，非但沒有損失，而且以幣値穩定之故，其於物價，金融各方面，必將發生十分良好的影饗，卽勞資間的薪資爭議，保持幣値的囤貨風潮，和不能歸籠的大量遊資，亦必以幣値穩定之故，而可望其漸次解决。政府在百忙之中，毅然决然，把這個重大的幣制問題迅予决定，付諸實施，其着眼當亦在是。</p>
<p>我們看到金圓券發行辦法，認爲最値得稱讚的，是確定了發行準備，條例上明自規定發行準備中，必須有百分之四十爲黄金自銀及外滙，其餘以有價瞪券及政府指定之國有事業資產爲之，這是說明政府在改革幣制之前，已有充分把握和準備。此外，金圓發行總額，又確定以二十億元爲限，發行額有了限制，其價値當然穩定。又新幣的發行，電在完全獨立，隨時公開宣布發行數額，方足昭大信於人民，因是條例中又規定關於準備之檢査。保管等事，將設立金圓券發行準備監理委員會以管理其事。從幾點看來，此次金圓券的發行，政府準備已久，可以說已經具備了幣制改革的必需條件。</p>
<p>不過我們認爲必須指出的，黄金是支付國際債務的重要工具，在新幣制與美金密切聯擊之時，實行收回國有，以期充實資金，自是正當的辦法。其關鍵在所定兌價，是否確與市價相符，而使持有黄金的人樂於承兌。假如照過去辦法，央行掛牌與實際市價脫範過鉅，則政府收兌的價格，勢必與央行掛牌完全一樣，依舊成爲一種具文。儘管法令規定逾限不許持有，而民間黄金，是否能悉數流回國庫，始終還是一個疑問。但看法幣流氣，已十餘年之久，而銀元還有市價，且有許多地方，仍在流通，可爲佐瞪。</p>
<p>又現行法幣，數額旣鉅，流通尤廣，假使新幣源源上市，充分供給，而在相當時期以內，恐未必能悉數收回。爲便利人民的支付起見，固不能不希望政府寬定限期，普令各行莊分別收兌，以免發生困難，但亦不能不確定暫准通用之期限，並明自宣佈終止發行，以免新舊幣混雜不淸，致增加通貨之膨脹。現在法幣的發行，已經明令停止，其已經發行的，並有限期收回的表示，此後此項命令，如何切實執行，其責任在主管機關了。</p>
<p>總之，改革幣制，原是一樁極重大的事情，在這新舊遞嬗之交，或有若干技術上的問題，使公私各方，不得不忍受相當的麻煩，但爲鞏固新幣的前途，與减輕人民的損害，凡一切可能發生的流弊，總期當局努力避免，爲政治上樹一其正刷新的指標。</p>
<h3>美援建設專款　為七千萬美元　美援售款部份凍結中美無異議　賴樸翰嚴家淦招待記者</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十九日電〕賴樸翰嚴家淦十九日上午聯合招待記者，報吿美援工業建設專款之數額已確定爲七千萬美元。其中三千五百萬美元爲供給我國所缺乏之工業配件，另三千五百萬美元之用途，尙未決定。爲執行比項工業建設工作，中美雙方將聯合成立一小組會，美方二人，中國三人，其人選尙未決定。</p>
<p>〔本報南京十九日電〕美援運用委員會聯絡專員嚴家淦十九日於聯合招待會中答復詢問時稱：關於美援物資出售後部分凍結問題，係中美雙邊協定中所規定。中美雙方對此均無不同意之處，日前渠與賴樸翰在滬發表聯合聲明所否認者，係十三日聯合會中並未討論此事買談不到作何決定。滬報曾將兩氏聲明誤認爲中美不同意凍結，實係誤會，賴璞翰亦起立稱：中美對於凍結部分美援物資出售款項一點，並無意見不同之處。</p>
<h3>馬卿談軍事援華　中國要求僅千六百萬元　美教練機二百架售我國</h3>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓十八日電〕國務卿馬歇爾今日於記者招待會中稱：中國在一億二千五百萬元援華金中，已明確要求者，僅値一千六百萬元之軍火。</p>
<p>顧維鈞大使來訪目的，在乎催促一億二千五百萬元之交付。</p>
<p>馬卿對參議員勃里奇所言已交付之物資僅値九百萬元一節，不予置計。對於實際已運華之數量，亦拒絕發表。</p>
<p>參議院消息靈通方面對焉歇爾所言，中國迄今僅要求價値一千六百萬元之軍火一節，表示驚訝稱：「明顯地，中國所需不止此數，且正在談判增加。」又稱：「不過，馬歇爾所指或爲眞正已經交來之請求單。」某方人士稱：援華計劃眞正實行爲時尙不長，渠稱：「實際上，自七月二十八日，接護「進行」指示以來工作尙不到一月。渠稱：衆信，此計劇將加速執行，於明年一月間，一億二千五百萬元將吿用罄，」繼稱：「中國欲儘量便宣，致談判頗多延擱」。渠稱，公文在過去曾爲計劃實施之一大障碼，現在已大部免除。</p>

<h3>嚴禁罷工罷課根據法令　毋須經立法程序　董局長答覆記者詢問</h3>
<p>〔中央社南京十九日電〕政院新聞局今日舉行記者會，董顯光答覆記者詢問如次：</p>
<p>（問）政院公布關於嚴禁罷工罷課之四項要點，究係一種新措施？抑可視爲現行條例或法律之重申？若係新措施，是否須經立院通過或由總統批准？警察雖無搜索票，亦可進入與搜索私人住宅，是否構成一部份憲法權利之廢止？果爾，是否須經總統使用國民大會所授予之緊急處分權而加批准。此間報紙數度透露，根據此項緊急處分權，而將採取之數種措施，正在擬議中，此訊確否？，若然，則是否如根據所載將包括郵電檢査在內？</p>
<p>（答）政院十七日通令各地行政治安機關，淸除能諜活動，安定地方秩序，嚴禁匪徒鼓動工人罷工，學生罷課，俱有現行法令之根據，母須經過立法程序。除刑法規定外，去年五月十八日國府公佈之維特社會秩序辦法，及同年七月十八日，國府公佈動員戡亂，完成憲政實施綱要，對安定社會秩序，取締罷工罷課聚衆遊行等擾亂治安行動之辦法，均有明確規定。至追躡罪泥，及現行泥或拘提抗傳之被告，司法警察雖無搜索票，亦可依照刑事訴訟法第一三一條之規定，進入住宅，及其他處所，逕行搜索。此種合法措施，對憲法賦予人民之基本權利，並無影響。</p>
<p>關於所擬議實施緊急措施一節，目前尙無消息奉吿。所稱報載或將施行郵電檢査，本人亦無所聞，惟在戒嚴地區內，當地最高軍事長官，根據戒嚴法之規定，有權施行郵電檢査。</p>

<h3>平特刑庭檢舉學生　胡適勸各生出庭　謂學校不是租界僅是個紙老虎</h3>
<p>本報北平十九日電〕胡適今就特刑庭檢舉學生答記者問稱：我一貫勸同學守法，同時希望政府按基本法律程序進行，現在政府旣發出傳票，學生就應出庭。法律上如需要學校帮助，可請法律敎授帮忙，我曾一再向學生說，學校不是租界，僅是個紙老虎。如果大家遵守法律，紙老虎還能維持。如果不出庭，都是廿多歲小夥子，校方也不能強拉他們去。不過據說北大的七十一個被傳學生，倒有四十三個在二個月前自行放棄學籍不知去向。大家推測大半是到「解放區」了，如果推測正確，這次的名單有七分之四是正確的。可是我不能指出來誰去「解放區」，誰是共產黨，也不能說我這裏絕無共產黨。今天二百多學生開會決定不出庭，並不能代表全體，這也是不守法。胡氏並稱：中央社十七日所發行政院十七日對各地行政治安機關頒發命令，文中列舉應行注意四點之第一點，謂依刑事訴訟法第三條規定如何如何，我曾遍査刑法第三條與第十三條，一三〇條皆無此規定，怕是第一三一條第三款之誤。據悉胡氏今下午五時將與特刑庭當局晤談。</p>

<h3>三國使節約見莫洛托夫　談判可望獲致妥協　史達林可能參加最後會談</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕倫敦十九日廣播莫斯科訊：英美法大使館十九日頗呈忙碌這象，但狀至中午止，迄無與英洛托夫有何新的約會，三國使節或將要求於二十日往晤莫氏。西方國家與蘇聯間有關柏林及德國問題之談判，似已面臨嚴重階段，三國使節刻正準備最後一次之會晤。美方發言人似較以往數日爲樂觀，但謂初度會談較爲容易，今後情形如何則殊難逆料。史達林是否參加下次會議尙不可知，伹信史民必參加最後一次會談。</p>

<h3>巴爾幹境集結大軍　蘇蓄意推翻狄托　南將領出亡被殺事件頗堪重視</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社維也納十八日電〔人民黨之喉舌「維納日報」載稱，共產情報局正在準備取軍事計劃，以對付南斯拉夫狄托之治權，聞巴爾幹某某數區已集有大軍，準備對南斯拉夫實行制裁。又聞捷克匈牙利與南斯拉夫諸方面均有動作，足證狄托與共產情報局間之衝突已在其他人民民主國中發生驚擾之反響。據該報之意，各重要地點屯集大軍，非欲直截對南斯拉夫取軍事行動，備欲以壓力加於「巴爾幹某國」而使屈服，甚至預料將於八月廿三日取此行動。</p>
<p>〔合衆社倫敦十九日電〕權威方面稱：前南斯拉夫參謀總長郁伐諾維志越界被擊斃事宜，表示狄托及史達林間之「冷戰」現已轉變爲「熱戰」。此等人士稱「此係克林姆宮企圖推倒狄托之繼續及加强。現時多瑙河會議吿結束，吾人可望其有進一步之發展。」關於如郁伐諾維志被擊之事件，此間以前亦略有所聞，一般認爲狄托與史達林間關係之新發展，純因西方代表在貝爾格勒出席多瑙河會議而告延遲。此間具有權威之巴爾幹問題專家預測，狄托與史達林間之分裂現將迅速擴大，在最近期內可能達於最高峯。渠等稱，「此項事件係狄托與克林姆間之冷戰轉變爲熱戰之初次徵兆。」</p>

<h3>寄渝航空新聞紙類　運量僅限三百公斤　郵局招待記者說明原因</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕本市郵政管理局，爲寄往重慶之航空新聞紙類暫停收寄問題，昨特招待各報記者，由該局帮辦王裕光報吿，略謂：上月份起中國，中央兩航空公司以汽油缺乏，减少各綫航機班次，公司對郵局郵件運量限制亦因此比例减少，滬渝綫减少尤多。該綫每週班機共八次，兩公司限定每週接受郵件運量二千二百公斤。據七月份統計，滬渝綫航郵單就信函，明信片，已達二千一百公斤，新聞紙類則達九百十公斤。郵局之業務以信函爲主，次則新聞紙，依以上統計數字，新聞紙類之運量，僅餘一百公斤，雖經郵局與航空公司再三交涉結果，僅允增加二百公斤，共三百公斤，佔全部需要量三分之一，此項數字尙係包括新闢之上海，九江，漢口綫運量在內，若一旦此綫停航，則函件集中滬渝綫，並此三分之一恐亦不能運出矣，故郵局目前希望二點：（一）請各報館，雜誌社自行向航空公司交寄。（二）希望各報館交寄之航郵新聞紙類運量，亦照七月份自動减少至三分之一。各報出席代表對郵局不得已之苦衷，咸表諒解，允將郵局建議之二點意見，歸向報館當局報吿，俾集體向航空公司提出交涉。</p>

<h3>空方肆壓力市勢勁挫　華股多種跌至限度　證券交易所公告今明休業兩天</h3>
<p>華股昨本極脆弱，新政策實行前夕，南京帮空方恣意放出各種流言，多方本屬烏合，立吿潰散，熱股跌停者與迫近限度者多種，永紗跌至限度以下，僅水泥股右紙袋運到而反漲停。</p>
<p>晨初人心對總統返京，種稱經濟改革更多顧慮，開來異常疲軟，低盤居多，永紗以一六八〇〇元登塲，開後自一六八五〇元起，因業外異常軟化，七一號一四五號一五四號一二號五六號一三號一六九號一〇二號一四八號一二五號九四號二二〇號一七九號六一號一一六號一六〇號一三七號力售，缺少彈力。十一時後，信和首先跌停，永紗亦繼之退至一五二八〇元跌停限度，始由一五三號二〇七號一〇七號一四八號一二號一三四號一三七號一四三號一〇二號五六號等補進，回升至一五七五〇元。六五號三五號七三號一七六號脫手，午收爲一五五三〇元，除上泥獨吿漲停，火柴統益華新雖跌而甚微外，餘股一致下降半成至一成不等。</p>
<p>後市銀根仍濫，永紗升至一五八五〇元開市，不旋踴，七一號二二〇號一五二號二二號五四號四號一〇二號六九號九九號一三四號一〇六號一二號急急了結，傳新政策即晚公布，行莊及市塲將休業三天，靜待整理，流言摧殘多方，永紗即吿跌停，信和勤興跌停板，一七六號一五三號一七八號一四三號六五號維持，升爲一五五〇〇元，三八號一六號九七號六七號一四五號七一號一五七號四號一九〇號等仍來斬多，美亞亦吿跌停，乃退至跌限以下，最低達一五一二〇元，臨收在一五二三〇元掙扎。但收後聞國行差出，微升至限度以上，較晨收計華新上泥漲停，中法跌停後有回，永紗美亞信和勤興跌停，餘均小拌迄半成不等，塲外各未上市股票，仍以世界等最俏</p>
<p>公債</p>
<p>昨幣制改革之希望更濃，新高峯層出無窮，甲乙爲二二〇萬，丙種見二九一萬，丁種達二三〇萬，戊種迫二五〇萬，臨收均受多方了結，各小一成結束。五五二室五五〇室賣出，五〇三室三六〇室五〇〇室買進，成交增爲一千餘萬，除丁種平平外，餘均繼續小升。</p>

<p>食油緩步下游，因各糧俱降，去路本已減少，更因業外各物之均小，益使人心虛軟。豆油終以一五六〇〇萬收市，計降六百萬元，生菜油獨挺，因有出口去路，開一四一〇〇萬，挺升二百萬元。生油挫二百萬，小車蔴油退五百萬。豆餅交易淸淡，降落七八十萬元。</p>

<h3>弘一法師與許紀園</h3>
<p>— 陸丹林</p>
<p>文友李芳遠昨由厦門來氾，晤談數次。芳遠是弘一和尙的大弟子，在談話間自然談到弘一的逸事來，無意中使我回憶起弘一與許幻園的死生契闊的故事，這是使人非常感動的故事。</p>
<p>姜丹書所寫弘一大師傳，有一段說：「嘗開豐子愷言，民十七八年間，上人暫居其滬寓偶話舊，忽欲尋訪城南草堂，子愷隨行；至則故居猶存，而主人已易，草堂改爲精舍；入則大動今昔之悲，頓向佛座五體投地，叩頭如搗蒜。肅穆之容，萬　爲寂，悽凉之氣，四壁寖寒。我佛有靈，當亦同下傷心之淚矣。旣知屋已易人，乃求故主何在，心誠求之，其人斯得。嗟夫，疇昔慷慨好義之文壇盟主許幻園者，頭已白，耳已聾，憔悴之狀不忍目，而猶伏處陋室，爲人備書，籍易升斗，以維生活。相接之下，又復大愴。久之，始破涕爲笑，追憶前塵，恍如癡人說夢。此情此景，陪坐之子愷，亦不禁涕之沾髯也。……」這一幕悲劇，由看破塵網的弘一演出，正表示他的法律精湛，友道熱腸，至情的充分顯露，又何怪旁觀的子愷流涕沾髯。而當事的弘一與幻園，各念前塵，他們欲哭無淚，只有破涕爲笑，此情此景，何等悲感啊！</p>
<p>許幻園，名踩，上海人，早年和寳山蔡小香，袁希濂，江陰張小　，弘一（當時用李息和的名字）等五人，義結金蘭，這是民國前十三年的事，地點是在城內靑龍橋的城南草堂。第二年，他們在福州路楊柳棋台舊址組織海上書畫公會，品茶讀畫，每週編印書畫報一紙。不久，張小樓應揚州東文學堂之聘，弘一入南洋公學，希濂入廣方言館，小香忙於醫院，幻園捐官作吏，書畫會便即停止。</p>
<p>袁希濂的「余與大飾之關係」：「……十七年師來上海，住江灣豐子愷家，余與小樓，幻園同往訪之。其時蔡小香早已去世，相與歎息，不勝今昔之感。於是吾四人重攝一影，並由師親筆題跋其上。……一這與美丹書所記的同一時候。</p>
<p>幻園的夫人是宋夢仙（貞）女士，工詩能畫，夫婦同拜王韜·江標為老師。庚子拳匪擾亂，幻園夫婦把家藏書畫義賣振濟，活人無算。民前十年，幻園悼亡，悲悼異常。過了幾年，會把夢仙夫人遺畫遍徵海內文人題詠，當時如陳散原·嚴範孫·樊雲門·吳昌碩·蔣觀雲·陳仁先·朱彊村·李梅菴等，都有詩文，弘一題詩，冠有小序，叙述彼此的友誼，文云；「夢仙大姊，幼學於王弢園先輩，能文章詩詞，又就靈縣京卿學畫，宗七薌家法，而能得其神韻，時人以出藍譽之。是書作於庚子九月。余方奉母居城南草堂，花晨月夕，母輙招大姊說詩評畫，引以爲樂。大姊多病，母爲治藥餌，視之如己出。壬寅荷花生日，大姊逝，越三年乙已，母亦棄養。余乃亡命海外，放浪無賴。迴憶纍日家庭之樂，唱和之雅，恍惚殆若隔世矣。今歲幻園姻兄示此幅，索爲題詞，余恫逝者之不作，悲生人之多艱，聊賦短什，以志哀思。」看了這段小序，便知道他們異姓金蘭，情同骨肉了。詩云：「人生如夢耳，哀樂到心頭。滬賸兩行淚，吟成一夕秋。慈雲渺天末，明月下南樓。壽世無長物，丹靑片羽留。</p>
<p>美人短命，名士坎坷，弘一又以貴公子而出家，其中三十年來事，悲歡離合，恍如一夢。熟情友愛如弘一法師，自然禁不住他的「大愴」與「破涕爲笑」。而今呢，他們五十年的金蘭兄弟，只賸下張小樓，袁希濂二人，近年上海習種發生，或作書畫，或業律師，度其晚年生活了。</p>
<h3>過嘉峪關作歌</h3>
<p>— 汪子雲</p>
<p>憶昔東過山海關，邊風吹月照團體，居庸立馬俯上谷，馬乳葡萄堆玉盤。攬響升車陟雁門，內外陰陽割曉昏，西飛遠適嘉峪北，平沙浩浩望無垠。蒙公長城；天際，祗今隳壞殘缺猶餘五千里；我生道長任勞薪，閱盡滄桑更作東西南北人！蟲沙猿鶴歷塵刦，度越關山夙所狎；御風聊試汗漫遊，笑指天山共白頭。</p>
<h3>燕兒窠足野餐為歌舞之會</h3>
<p>遠足遠期「烏拉拜」，近郊近駐「燕兒窠」，幕天好試天魔舞，席地眞成踏地歌。</p>
<p>引吭老叟有遺音，流水高山自寫心，王軫金徽異中土，銅絲靜撫六絃琴。</p>
<h3>弘一法師遺像</h3>

<h3>當代第一豪華巨輪　「伊麗莎白皇后」</h3>
<p>— 蘭心</p>
<p>到目前爲止，全世界最大最豪華的輪船是英國的郵船「伊麗莎白皇后號」，這條船重八三·六七三噸，船長一〇三一英尺，有甲板十四層，船上有大小不同的馬達六百五十個，發出的電流足敷一個十幾萬人的小城市之需。</p>
<p>船上的頭等艙房中都有冷熱氣設備，有浴室，有應用無一綫電的電話機，乘客拿起了話機，就可以和全世界任何一個大都市通電話。</p>
<p>船上有兩所電影院，兩個游泳池，三個健身房，十二個酒吧間，甚至還有土耳其浴設備。此外，還有三個圖書館，藏有用十四種不同的語文印刷的書四千册。還有三家銀行，六家商店，美容院，理髮室。</p>
<p>船上的醫療設備極爲完全，有施用外科手術的大手術室，有普通醫院，有隔離病院。</p>
<p>每天，船上須開出一萬多客飯，因此船上必需自己預備好各種食物。洗衣裳也是一件驚人的工作，每在英美間横渡一次，「伊麗莎白皇后輪一的洗衣間就須洗一萬條被單，二萬塊餐巾，七萬塊毛巾。</p>
<p>第二次大戰爆發時，「伊麗莎白皇后輪」尙未完工，正是德國轟炸機最好的轟炸目標。英國方面爲安全起見，就匆匆讓它冒險越過佈滿了潛艇的大西洋，駛往美國紐約碇泊。這是一九四〇年三月二日，就是「伊麗莎白皇后輪」的處女航了。</p>
<p>同年十一月，它奉命駛抵星加坡，改裝爲運輸艦，此後連續輸運軍隊，頗著功績。日軍窺伺澳洲時，一伊麗莎白皇后輪」就曾裝過美國兵到澳洲去。它在平時能搭載旅客二千三百十四名，但運兵的時候竟能搭載一萬五千六百名之多。</p>
<p>有一次，一個糊塗的美國兵在船上吿訴他的同伴說。「啊，這種船當然祗有我們美國才有，英國人看見了要眼紅煞了！」</p>
<p>不想這句話正好給船長比塞爵士聽見了。他立刻下令，把伊麗莎白輪的簡史寫下來，掛在公吿牌的地方，讓大家知道這艘輪船正是大英帝國的產物。，</p>
<p>德國的潛水艇當然不肯放鬆這樣一個絕好的月標，但是「伊麗莎白皇后輪」船身雖大，却極靈活，速度又快每小時能行駛三十浬之多，那些潛水艇終於毫無辦法。希特勒還特地出了一個賞格，凡能擊沉這條船的潛艇船員，可以得到德軍最高的榮譽獎章，另給賞洋二十萬美元。但是後來査査德國海軍的紀錄，却祗有一只潛艇曾在折光鏡中望見過一伊麗莎白皇后輪」——而那隻潛艇的水雷剛巧已經全部用完，只好眼睜睜看它安然駛去。</p>
<p>希特勒出的賞格祗有二十萬美元，但是現在「伊麗莎白皇后輪」復員之後，每在英美間來回一程，就可以賺到一百三十萬美元呢。</p>
<h3>戰爭與和平</h3>
<p>— 溶東</p>
<p>據「世界文摘」的記載：在過去的三十四世紀中，共有：</p>
<p>三千一百年的戰爭；</p>
<p>二百七十七年的和平；</p>
<p>八千種和平條約。</p>
<h3>貴賤</h3>
<p>— 梅</p>
<p>荷屬東印度的峇里島是一個風景極美的地方，當地的少女尤以健美著名。那島上的居民們對一胎雙生一男一女時，却有兩種奇怪的說法。第一種說法流傳於貴族中，他們認爲這一對孩子前世必然是恩愛的夫妻，所以投胎時仍舊不肯分離，眞是難能可貴。第二種說法流行於平民階級，與前說恰好相反，他們認爲這一對嬰孩在出生之前便已犯了亂倫大罪，簡直是家門不幸，所以那對孩子的父母必須齋戒贖罪，大大的化一筆錢。</p>
<h3>靜坐經騐談（三）</h3>
<p>— 江問漁</p>
<p>現在我每次靜坐，皆是默數呼吸四百次，因爲每次需十五分鐘，數完四組——四百次，剛好一小時。又單盤膝時，有時右下面的小腿，不免發麻，我現在也得了較久的經驗，大致歷三十分鐘即感覺到麻，麻則換腿盤之，故每次靜坐，必換盤一次，目前已經成爲常例。</p>
<p>此外我還有一種經驗，即初習靜坐，一定要盤膝坐，久之，即坐在椅視上，兩腿下垂，行之亦可。我最近偶爾在室外坐而納凉，閉目伸腰，亦可以排除思念，行深細呼吸，歷一小時，腹部照常發熱。</p>
<p>又靜坐時口腔內有多量津液生出，這也可算是一種異狀。我的經驗，是晚間或下午坐時，津液特別多，而晨間坐時則爲量極少。</p>
<p>以上所說，自信是極忠實，極客觀，所可惜的，平日未能在日記上將所發見的異狀，詳細記明。從本年九月一日起，我已決定擬好一個表格，每日專來記載了。</p>
<p>靜坐的效果</p>
<p>繼此當再一言靜坐的效果。如七六高齡蔣竹老，靜坐五十餘年，今猶耳目聰明，腰脚强健，每日敎書，作文，處理各事，一如中年人，當然是一個最好的模範。不過作文不能忘了題目，此處所說的效果，自應以我個人所經歷的爲限。我是夙患血壓高病的人，究竟靜坐對於這種病的影響怎樣呢？我不妨詳細一言：在州五年五月底，我曾訪醫檢査過一次，血壓只有一百七十五度，當時習靜坐才歷一個月；卅六年五月，又經檢査，反而高了，到一百九十度，此時習靜坐已經一年了，這如伺解釋呢？原來我自己早有一種體驗，就是血整不是一向皆高的，有時高有時低，換句話說，病發時高病不發時低。至舊病發和未發，我自己是明白的。當病發時，一定頭覺得有點暈，左腿左臂（只一小部份）有一些麻，身體不大自在。發見此種現象，時期持續的久暫，依我的經驗：三十年在重慶時，有時竟可延長至十天或一期持續的時期，可算最長了。卅一年離渝到黔東湄潭縣居住，實行休養，不作何事，便覺得好得許多，病發時，不過經過二三天，即可平復。卅五年四月回到上海，於今已近兩年半，最初　一年半，還是每一個或四十天，發作一次，但持續年時期已極短，病的分量已極輕；最近一年，發病時期的距離，更逐漸加火，分量也更覺輕微了。於此可以明白三十五年檢査只有一百七十五度，那恰巧是在病未發時，三十六年檢得一百九十度，那正是舊病發作時。近一年來，我在學校擔任敎書，連講兩課，毫不覺得吃力，作文時間思用腦，可持續至三四小時，也不覺得怎樣的十分頭昏腦漲。古人所謂「如人飲水，冷暖自知」，這是我個人親身的體騐。現在可斷言：在未返滬以前，血壓高能逐漸輕减，是由於休息，返滬以後，血壓高能逐漸减輕，似乎不能不把一部分的功續，歸到靜坐了。這是第一個效果。還有我平常容易傷風，每每於無意中，受到冷空氣的襲擊，便是打噴嚏，流鼻涕，旋即鼻腔腫塞，甚且延及喉頭·氣管，現在一年半來，已沒有這樣情形了。又從前消化不良，也是常有的事，現在也沒有了。這可算第二個效果。又有時過分用腦，感到疲勞，或頭部有一點不爽快，此時即去靜坐，坐了一小時或五十分，再起來時，已覺舒適異常，完全恢復常態。尤其令我適意的，在晚間靜坐之後，頭一落枕，即酣然睡去，夢且一點沒有，這也可算是第三個效果。</p>
<p>我習靜坐以來，所能經騐到的，大概就是這幾種。</p>

<h3>Presidential Decree Reforms Currency System: Issues 2 Billion Gold Yuan Certificates, Prohibits Circulation or Possession of Gold, Silver, and Foreign Currencies</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 19th] President Chiang issued four important financial and economic measures and a financial and economic emergency decree on the 19th. The original text is as follows:</p>
<p>Presidential Order: In accordance with the provisions of the Temporary Provisions During the Period of National Mobilization for the Suppression of Rebellion, and upon the resolution of the Executive Yuan Council, the following Financial and Economic Emergency Decree is hereby promulgated, the main points of which are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Effective immediately, the Gold Yuan shall be the standard currency. Gold Yuan Certificates shall be issued with full reserves, and the circulation of previously issued Legal Tender and Northeast Circulation Certificates shall be redeemed within a limited time.</p>
<p>(2) All gold, silver, silver coins, and foreign currency notes held by the people shall be redeemed within a limited time. Possession by anyone shall be prohibited after the deadline.</p>
<p>(3) The foreign exchange assets of Chinese citizens held abroad shall be registered and managed within a limited time, and those who violate this shall be sanctioned.</p>
<p>(4) Financial administration shall be reorganized and economic controls shall be strengthened to stabilize prices and balance the national budget and international balance of payments.</p>
<p>Based on the above main points, the following are hereby formulated: (1) Measures for the Issuance of Gold Yuan Certificates, (2) Measures for the Handling of Gold, Silver, and Foreign Currencies Held by the People, (3) Measures for the Registration and Management of Foreign Exchange Assets Held Abroad by Citizens of the Republic of China, (4) Measures for Reorganizing Financial Administration and Strengthening Economic Controls, which are promulgated simultaneously with this decree. Each of these measures shall be regarded as part of this decree. The Executive Yuan is authorized to promulgate necessary regulations or supplementary measures for each of these measures to facilitate the implementation of this decree.</p>
<p>[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 19th] The financial and economic emergency decree issued by the President was first proposed for discussion at the Central Political Committee of the Kuomintang held at 3:00 PM on the 19th and was approved. The meeting was personally presided over by President Chiang. Premier Weng Wenhao presented a report, and Finance Minister Wang Yunwu also attended the Central Political Committee meeting to report. The discussion was detailed and lasted for three hours, ending at 6:20 PM. After the meeting, all committee members kept the matter confidential. However, Weng Wenhao immediately took the plan to the Executive Yuan and presented it for discussion at the Executive Yuan Council, which lasted for three hours, ending at 9:40 PM. The proposal was then announced as passed and it was decided to implement it with immediate effect.</p>
<p>[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 19th] The new economic reform plan and currency system reform issue, which the people of the whole country have been paying attention to and deeply hoping for for a long time, were finally passed at the Central Political Committee of the Kuomintang and the Provisional Executive Yuan Council held successively at 3:00 PM and 6:00 PM on the 19th. The President, in accordance with the provisions of the Temporary Provisions for the Period of National Mobilization for the Suppression of Rebellion, promulgated a financial and economic emergency decree to implement it, to control finance, dredge materials, and achieve the effect of stabilizing the market. The decree prioritizes currency system reform, issuing Gold Yuan Certificates and its metallic subsidiary coins with full reserves to recover Legal Tender and rebuild a sound currency system. The Gold Yuan Certificates have sufficient reserves. The decree specifically stipulates that the existing gold, silver, and foreign currency of the national government shall constitute 40% of the reserve, with the remainder being guarantee reserves, which can be said to be sufficient reserves, which can achieve the stability of the currency value of the Gold Yuan Certificates that will soon be in circulation. At the same time, the total amount of Gold Yuan Certificates issued has been rigidly limited to no more than 2 billion yuan, eliminating the endless issuance of the past. In terms of credit, it should be able to further consolidate the foundation of the new currency. Secondly, the decree stipulates that issuance shall be made public, and a supervisory committee for the issuance reserve shall be jointly formed by the government and social figures to supervise the quantity of issuance and conduct strict inspections, and to announce it at any time. This measure, which can enhance people's firm confidence, is unprecedented in past currency issuance. According to this plan, the result of careful research and overall planning by Premier Weng and relevant personnel. Secondly, the ratio between the Gold Yuan Certificates and Legal Tender, US dollars, and silver dollars can be referenced by the market price, so there will be no major impact at the beginning of the reform. As for the "Measures for the Registration and Management of Foreign Assets Held by the People" and the "Measures for Reorganizing Finance and Strengthening Financial Control", the former has been criticized by the national opinion circles and public opinion institutions for a long time, but has not been resolved. The latter is some current issues, realistic matters caused by currency system reform, have been stipulated, such as the treatment of civil servants and the stability of prices of public utilities, etc., will have good development. The promulgation of this order makes some people think that long-awaited plans and plans can be made in finance.</p>

<h3>Prices Show a Downward Trend, People in Shanghai, Suzhou, and Zhenjiang are Encouraged</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper Report] When the news of the currency system reform was transmitted to the city last night, the streets and alleys immediately became the subject of conversation. Responsible persons in the financial community adopted a reserved attitude towards this move because they had not obtained the full text of the measures, and believed that the appropriateness of some technical measures was closely related to the success or failure of the currency system reform. It is generally believed that the government's resolute reform of the currency system must have considerable confidence in foreign exchange and reserves, and the prerequisite for the success of the currency system reform is sufficient reserves. In terms of the impact of this move on prices, it is generally believed that a slight degree of confusion is almost inevitable, but because of the holidays of the silver and money industry, there will be a lack of cash on the market, and at the same time, the relevant authorities will inevitably take strict supporting measures, and prices will have a downward trend in the short term.</p>
<p>[This Newspaper, Wuxi, 19th] The news of the currency system reform arrived in Wuxi after 9:00 PM, so the commercial sector did not see any impact. However, the general mentality was to buy goods, but because all industries had closed at night, there was nothing to buy.</p>
<p>[This Newspaper, Suzhou, 19th] After the news of the currency system reform reached Suzhou, the market suddenly became excited and chaotic. People were nervous and prices of all goods fell. The silver and money industry held an emergency meeting and decided to close for two days and reopen on the 23rd.</p>
<p>[This Newspaper, Zhenjiang, 19th] Tonight, after the news that the government decided to implement the economic reform plan was conveyed here from Beijing and Shanghai, because the night market transactions in Zhenjiang were scarce, the market reaction was still tentative. However, the general public expressed great encouragement because the new economic plan will definitely have a good effect on stabilizing prices.</p>
<p>[This Newspaper, Beiping, 19th] After the order for all banks and money houses in the country to take a two-day holiday from the 20th arrived, prices of all goods in the Beiping market plummeted. Green Sunshine City cloth plummeted from 150 million to 88 million.</p>
<h3>Zhang Qun to Visit MacArthur in Japan to Exchange Views on the Entire Far East Situation</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper Report] Zhang Qun and his wife arrived in Shanghai from Beijing yesterday afternoon at 1:00 PM on the Qiantang train and will fly to Japan on the 21st for a short inspection.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Tokyo, 19th] Senior American officials in Tokyo are very interested in Zhang Qun's visit to Japan. Zhang is expected to arrive in Japan at the end of this week, and shortly after arriving, he is expected to visit Marshal MacArthur. It is reported that MacArthur is looking forward to General Zhang Qun's arrival and is prepared to exchange views with him on the entire Far East situation. Although Zhang's visit to Japan is nominally private, it seems certain that he will be regarded here as President Chiang's representative and will be treated with due dignity. In some ways, Zhang's visit to Japan is similar to Chen Lifu's visit to the United States. It is believed here that Dewey will definitely be elected this year, and that the foreign policy of the Dewey government will include efforts to support the Chinese government's attempt to annihilate the Communist army. It is generally believed here that in anticipation of Dewey's election, President Chiang is waiting for detailed reports from Chen Lifu and Zhang Qun on the attitude of the leaders of the American Republican Party.</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Currency System Reform Has Been Implemented</h3>
<p>Opinions on reforming the currency system have always been divided into two factions: one advocates immediate reform, believing that the economy will not stabilize without reforming the currency system first; the other advocates preparing first and initiating reform only when conditions are met and the timing is right, otherwise a new form of legal tender will replace the existing legal tender, which will not benefit the country's economy and people's livelihood.</p>
<p>Among the reform proposals, there are many differences of opinion on the standard of the new currency. Most Chinese people tend to focus on managed currency, i.e., a planned paper currency standard. The reason is that restoring hard currency, whether gold or silver, is no longer suitable for the trend of the times, and China is not a country that produces gold or silver, and it is impossible to store enough hard currency in a short period of time.</p>
<p>Now the currency reform plan has been explicitly ordered by the President, and four methods, including the issuance of Gold Yuan notes, have been passed by the Central Political Conference and the Executive Yuan's Political Affairs Conference yesterday. The main points are (1) adopting the gold standard, with four new currencies equal to one US dollar, and three million legal currencies equal to one new currency; (2) gold will be recovered by the state, and silver dollars will also be recovered by the government, with the price set at two new currencies equal to one silver dollar. This measure has solved the above two problems, and the timing and standard of the reform can be said to be decisive. This is a major event worth noting in China's economic history.</p>
<p>The fact that 3 million legal currencies are equal to one new currency inevitably reminds people of the fact that counterfeit currency was 200 times the legal currency. However, the new currency is four yuan, which is equivalent to one US dollar, which is not far from the recent foreign exchange black market, so there is not much actual loss, and it is closely linked to the US dollar. The value of this rate can be expected to be consolidated from now on, which is completely different from the situation where counterfeit currency is converted into legal currency. Therefore, if the point that four new currencies are equivalent to one US dollar can be maintained accurately and never changed, then not only will those who have special legal currency not suffer losses, but also because of the stability of the currency value, it will definitely have a very good impact on prices, finance and other aspects. That is, the salary dispute between labor and capital, the hoarding trend of maintaining the value of the currency, and the large amount of floating capital that cannot be returned will also be gradually resolved because of the stability of the currency value. The government, in its busy schedule, resolutely decided to promptly decide on this major currency issue and put it into practice. The focus is also on this.</p>
<p>We believe that what is most commendable about the Gold Yuan note issuance method is that it establishes the issuance reserve. The regulations clearly stipulate that 40% of the issuance reserve must be gold and silver and foreign exchange, and the rest must be valuable securities and state-owned assets designated by the government. This shows that the government has sufficient confidence and preparation before reforming the currency system. In addition, the total amount of Gold Yuan issued is also determined to be limited to 2 billion yuan, and the value of the issued amount will naturally be stable when the issuance amount is limited. In addition, the issuance of new currency must be completely independent and the amount issued must be announced to the public at any time in order to show great faith to the people. Therefore, the regulations also stipulate that a Gold Yuan note issuance reserve supervision committee will be established to manage matters such as the inspection and storage of the reserve. From several points of view, the government has been preparing for a long time for this issuance of Gold Yuan notes, and it can be said that it has met the necessary conditions for currency reform.</p>
<p>However, we believe that it must be pointed out that gold is an important tool for paying international debts. When the new currency system is closely linked to the US dollar, it is a legitimate method to implement the recovery of state ownership in order to enrich funds. The key is whether the fixed exchange rate is truly in line with the market price, so that people who hold gold are happy to accept it. If the central bank's posted price deviates too much from the actual market price as in the past, then the government's redemption price will inevitably be exactly the same as the central bank's posted price, and it will still become a mere formality. Although the law stipulates that holding gold is not allowed beyond the time limit, whether the people's gold can be returned to the national treasury in full is still a question. However, the fact that the legal currency has been flowing for more than ten years and the silver dollar still has a market price and is still circulating in many places can be used as proof.</p>
<p>In addition, the amount of current legal currency is very large and the circulation is very wide. If the new currency is launched on the market in a steady stream and is fully supplied, it may not be possible to recover all of it within a considerable period of time. For the sake of facilitating people's payments, we cannot but hope that the government will set a broad deadline and order all banks to redeem them separately to avoid difficulties, but we must also determine the temporary period of validity and explicitly announce the termination of issuance, so as to avoid the confusion of new and old currencies and increase currency inflation. Now the issuance of legal currency has been explicitly ordered to stop, and there is an expression that the issued ones will be recovered within a limited time. In the future, how to effectively implement this order is the responsibility of the competent authority.</p>
<p>In short, reforming the currency system is originally an extremely important matter. In this transition between the old and the new, there may be some technical problems that force all parties, public and private, to endure considerable trouble, but in order to consolidate the future of the new currency and reduce the harm to the people, the authorities should strive to avoid all possible abuses and set a new and refreshing indicator in politics.</p>
<h3>US Aid Construction Fund: 70 Million US Dollars; No Disagreement between China and the US on Freezing Part of the US Aid Sales Funds; Leighton Stuart and Yen Chia-kan Host Reporters</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 19th] Leighton Stuart and Yen Chia-kan jointly hosted reporters on the morning of the 19th to report that the amount of the US aid industrial construction fund has been determined to be 70 million US dollars. Among them, 35 million US dollars are for supplying industrial parts that China lacks, and the use of the other 35 million US dollars has not yet been determined. In order to implement the industrial construction work, China and the US will jointly establish a small group meeting, with two members from the US and three from China. The candidates have not yet been determined.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 19th] Yen Chia-kan, Liaison Commissioner of the US Aid Utilization Committee, stated in response to inquiries at the joint reception on the 19th that the partial freezing of the proceeds from the sale of US aid materials is stipulated in the Sino-US bilateral agreement. There is no disagreement between China and the US on this point. What he and Leighton Stuart denied in the joint statement issued in Shanghai a few days ago was that the matter was not discussed at the joint meeting on the 13th and there was no decision to be made. The Shanghai newspapers mistakenly regarded the two men's statement as a disagreement between China and the US on the freezing, which was a misunderstanding. Leighton Stuart also stood up and said that there was no difference of opinion between China and the US on the freezing of part of the proceeds from the sale of US aid materials.</p>
<h3>Marshall Talks About Military Aid to China: China Only Requests 16 Million Yuan; 200 US Trainer Aircraft Sold to China</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 18th] Secretary of State Marshall said at a press conference today that China has clearly requested only 16 million yuan worth of military supplies from the 125 million yuan in aid to China.</p>
<p>Ambassador Gu Weijun's purpose in visiting is to urge the payment of 125 million yuan.</p>
<p>Marshall did not comment on Senator Bridges' statement that the delivered materials were only worth 9 million yuan. He also declined to disclose the actual amount that has been shipped to China.</p>
<p>Senate sources were surprised by Marshall's statement that China has only requested 16 million yuan worth of military supplies so far, saying, "Obviously, China needs more than that and is negotiating to increase it." They also said, "However, what Marshall is referring to may be the actual requests that have been submitted." A certain person said that the US aid to China plan has not been implemented for a long time, saying, "In fact, the work has been going on for less than a month since July 28, when the 'proceed' instructions were received. He said: "It is believed that this drama will be accelerated and the 125 million yuan will be exhausted by January next year. He continued: "China wants to be as cheap as possible, which has caused many delays in the negotiations. He said that official documents used to be a major obstacle to the implementation of the plan, but now most of them have been eliminated.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, New York, 18th] The North American Aviation Company announced today that it has sold 200 Harvard trainer aircraft, 125 Pratt &amp; Whitney aircraft engines, and parts to the Chinese Air Force. North American Aviation Company Manager Bob said that the aircraft and engines will be shipped to China from the West Coast. In addition, these aircraft were originally purchased by the California government as war surplus materials.</p>
<p>[French News Agency, Moscow, 18th] TASS criticized today that Denmark supplied the Chinese government with military supplies worth 1.1 million kroner, saying that according to the Copenhagen newspaper in Denmark, the military supplies have been delivered in the past few months. According to the newspaper, Denmark will soon sign a trade agreement with Spain, with a limit of 12 million kroner.</p>
<h3>Telegraph Registered Word Count: Changed to Six Digits from Today</h3>
<p>The Telecommunications Bureau has recently received an order that all telegraph registered numbers will be changed to six digits starting today. The registered number of this newspaper was "6078", and it has now been changed to "526078".</p>
<h3>Strict Prohibition of Strikes and Class Boycotts Based on Laws and Regulations: No Need for Legislative Procedures; Director Dong Answers Reporter Inquiries</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 19th] The Executive Yuan's Information Bureau held a press conference today, and Dong Xian-guang answered reporters' inquiries as follows:</p>
<p>(Question) The Executive Yuan announced four key points on strictly prohibiting strikes and class boycotts. Is this a new measure? Or can it be regarded as a reaffirmation of existing regulations or laws? If it is a new measure, does it need to be passed by the Legislative Yuan or approved by the President? Even if the police do not have a search warrant, they can enter and search private residences. Does this constitute a repeal of some constitutional rights? If so, does it need to be approved by the President using the emergency powers granted by the National Assembly? Newspapers here have repeatedly revealed that several measures are being drafted based on this emergency power. Is this news confirmed? If so, will it include postal and telegraph inspections as reported?</p>
<p>(Answer) The Executive Yuan issued an order to administrative and security agencies in various places on the 17th to eliminate espionage activities, stabilize local order, and strictly prohibit bandits from inciting workers to strike and students to boycott classes. These are all based on existing laws and regulations and do not need to go through legislative procedures. In addition to the provisions of the Criminal Law, the Measures for Maintaining Social Order promulgated by the National Government on May 18 last year, and the Outline for Mobilization to Suppress Rebellions and Complete Constitutional Implementation promulgated by the National Government on July 18 of the same year, clearly stipulate measures for stabilizing social order and suppressing actions that disrupt public order such as strikes, class boycotts, and mass marches. As for pursuing criminals and arresting defendants who resist summons or detentions, judicial police can enter residences and other places and conduct searches directly in accordance with the provisions of Article 131 of the Criminal Procedure Law even without a search warrant. These legal measures do not affect the basic rights granted to the people by the Constitution.</p>
<p>There is no news to report regarding the proposed implementation of emergency measures. I have not heard of the so-called postal and telegraph inspections reported in the newspapers. However, in martial law areas, the local supreme military commander has the right to conduct postal and telegraph inspections in accordance with the provisions of the Martial Law.</p>
<h3>Chen Lifu Visits Dewey: Broad Discussion on Far East and China Issues</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, New York, 18th] Vice President Chen Lifu visited Governor Dewey of New York State in Albany, the state capital, today. Chen told reporters from the Central News Agency upon his return that "Governor Dewey expressed great concern about China. He asked many detailed questions. We talked for an hour, and the conversation was very cordial." Chen will meet with the publishers of Time, Life, and Fortune magazines on the 19th.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, New York State, 18th] Chen Lifu, Vice President of the Chinese Legislative Yuan, met with Governor Dewey of New York for half an hour on the 18th. Dewey did not comment on the meeting, only that the two had broadly discussed issues in the Far East and China. Republican presidential candidate Dewey has repeatedly advocated supporting the Chinese National Government and has repeatedly warned against resisting the communist threat. Before the passage of the Marshall Plan, Dewey criticized the federal government for "helping and comforting the communist conquest of China." Chen carried a letter of introduction from President Chiang, which stated: "I hope that he will take the opportunity of his visit to study your democratic system and the role of your political parties. Please receive him and provide convenience. I am very grateful."</p>

<h3>Special Criminal Court Indicts Students, Hu Shih Advises Students to Appear in Court, Saying the University is Not a Concession but a Paper Tiger</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Peiping, Our Newspaper, 19th] Hu Shih, in response to reporters' questions about the Special Criminal Court's indictment of students, said: "I have always advised students to abide by the law, and at the same time, I hope the government will proceed according to basic legal procedures. Now that the government has issued summonses, students should appear in court. If the school needs help legally, it can ask law professors for assistance. I have repeatedly told students that the school is not a concession but just a paper tiger. If everyone abides by the law, the paper tiger can still be maintained. If they don't appear in court, they are all young men in their twenties, and the school cannot force them to go." However, it is said that 43 of the 71 students from Peking University who were summoned voluntarily gave up their enrollment two months ago and their whereabouts are unknown. Everyone speculates that most of them have gone to the "Liberated Areas." If the speculation is correct, then four-sevenths of the names on this list are accurate. But I cannot point out who has gone to the "Liberated Areas," who is a Communist, nor can I say that there are absolutely no Communists here. Today, more than two hundred students held a meeting and decided not to appear in court, which does not represent the entire student body and is also a violation of the law."

<h3>Three Allied Envoys Meet with Molotov, Negotiations Expected to Reach Compromise, Stalin May Attend Final Talks</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Report] London 19th Broadcast Moscow News: The British, American, and French embassies were quite busy on the 19th. However, as of noon, there were no new appointments with Molotov. The three envoys may request to meet with Molotov on the 20th. Negotiations between Western countries and the Soviet Union on the Berlin and German issues seem to have reached a critical stage. The three envoys are currently preparing for their final meeting. The American spokesperson seems more optimistic than in previous days, but said that the initial talks were easier and it is difficult to predict what will happen in the future. It is not yet known whether Stalin will attend the next meeting, but it is believed that Stalin will definitely attend the final talks.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse London 19th] According to reliable sources: British Foreign Secretary Bevin has new instructions for Roberts.

<p>[Associated Press Berlin 19th] The "German News Agency," licensed by the Soviet Union, reported from Moscow on the 19th that the final meeting between the special envoys of the United States, Britain, and France and Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov will be held on the 19th or 20th. The report also said that Moscow diplomatic observers believe that an agreement on the Four Power Foreign Ministers' Conference to discuss the German issue will be reached by the end of this week. The news agency also said that Western countries are expected to attempt to hold another meeting with Premier Stalin before the agreement is completed. Soviet-controlled newspapers only publish Moscow reports, and conversely, focus on the Western powers' plans to control the Ruhr area and establish a West German government. Some believe that at this time of the Moscow negotiations, repeating these two old tunes indicates that the Kremlin is reiterating that West Germany and the Ruhr are the price for any agreement. American diplomatic representatives in Berlin said that they have not received any reports of a foreshadowing of the Four Power Conference, and they are also not aware of whether the Moscow negotiations have entered the final stage.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse Washington 18th] Although pessimistic news came from the Moscow talks yesterday, the general public is now cautiously optimistic about the outcome of the talks.

As for the issue of the status of West Germany, it will be left to the Foreign Ministers' Conference to resolve.</p>

<p>France Expresses Determination to Maintain Its Entitled Rights</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse Prague 19th] Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Vyshinsky flew here from Belgrade today, accompanied by Czech Foreign Minister Clementis and his delegation.</p>
<p>[United States Information Service Washington 18th] The State Department announced tonight that the United States cannot accept the draft Danube River Convention imposed by the Soviet Union on its satellite states at the Belgrade Conference. The State Department said that the document signed in Belgrade today failed to ensure freedom of trade and equal trade, and did not implement the orders of the Foreign Ministers' Conference. The statement also said, "The actions of the Soviet delegation clearly show the Soviet Union's determination to extend its economic and political enslavement of the nations along the Danube River. The Soviet Union's refusal to accept provisions that guarantee genuine commercial freedom and equal treatment has closed one of the main gateways for East-West trade. The Soviet delegation's rhetoric of 'freedom of navigation' is purely empty and has no substance."</p>

<h3>Large Armies Gather on Balkan Borders, Soviet Union Intends to Overthrow Tito, Assassination of Yugoslav Generals Who Fled is Noteworthy</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse Vienna 18th] The People's Party mouthpiece "Wiener Tageblatt" stated that the Cominform is preparing a military plan to deal with Yugoslav Tito's rule. It is heard that large armies have gathered in certain areas of the Balkans, preparing to impose sanctions on Yugoslavia. It is also heard that there are movements in the Czech, Hungarian, and Yugoslav areas, which proves that the conflict between Tito and the Cominform has caused alarming repercussions in other People's Democratic countries. According to the newspaper, the deployment of large armies in important locations is not intended to take direct military action against Yugoslavia, but to put pressure on "a certain Balkan country" to make it yield. It is even expected that this action will be taken on August 23.</p>
<p>[Associated Press London 19th] Authoritative sources said that the killing of former Yugoslav Chief of Staff Yovanović after crossing the border indicates that the "Cold War" between Tito and Stalin has now turned into a "Hot War." These people said, "This is a continuation and strengthening of the Kremlin's attempt to overthrow Tito. Now that the Danube River Conference is over, we can expect further developments." Similar incidents to the killing of Yovanović have been heard here before, and it is generally believed that the new development in the relationship between Tito and Stalin was delayed purely because Western representatives attended the Danube River Conference in Belgrade. Authoritative Balkan affairs experts here predict that the split between Tito and Stalin will now expand rapidly and may reach its peak in the near future. They said, "This incident is the first sign of the Cold War between Tito and the Kremlin turning into a Hot War."</p>
<h3>Romanian Government Denounces Tito</h3>
<p>[Associated Press Bucharest 18th] The Romanian government on the 18th denounced the Yugoslav border guards' killing of former Yugoslav Chief of Staff Lieutenant General Yovanović, and implied that Yovanović had attempted to command "Free Yugoslav Forces" to attack Marshal Tito. The Romanian Gazette said that the number of communists in Yugoslavia who oppose Tito is increasing day by day, and Tito's comrade Yovanović is one of them. "When the Yugoslav communists struggle to liberate the Republic of Yugoslavia from the terrorist regime of traitors who destroy Yugoslavia's freedom and independence and endanger the peace of all countries, their resistance cannot be submerged by the wave of terror." The Romanian government seized the opportunity of Yovanović's killing to accuse Tito of launching a "mad wave of terror" within the group, arresting and killing all those who oppose Tito.</p>

<h3>Korean New Government Established for Only a Few Days, Opposition Party Launches No-Confidence Vote, Syngman Rhee Plans to Form New Political Party to Counter</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency Seoul 19th] It is reported that members of the Datong Youth Corps (led by Yi Cheong-cheon) and members of the Korean Democratic Party (led by Kim Seong-soo) who are dissatisfied with the current cabinet are joining hands in an attempt to reorganize the cabinet through legal procedures, and will overthrow it. The method is to propose a vote of no confidence in the current government, and with a two-thirds majority of the members, change the presidential system to a responsible cabinet system. If both of these fail, they will take an opposing stance to all bills submitted by the government, and propose bills that are contrary to the government's policies. It is heard that Syngman Rhee, in response to this plan, also intends to recruit cabinet members to form a powerful new political party with members of the Independence Promotion Association (led by Yi himself, with 56 seats in the National Assembly) and a part of non-party members, in order to confront the anti-government faction in the National Assembly. In this situation, it is doubtful whether Korea's administration can be actively promoted.</p>

<h3>Various Organizations in This City Telegraph the Executive Yuan in Support of Measures to Eliminate Communist Spies; Appeal to the Public to Follow Unanimously; Conduct Self-Rectification and Assist in Reporting</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce Preparatory Committee, the Municipal Federation of Industry, the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, the Municipal Farmers' Association, the Municipal Fishermen's Association, the Municipal Education Association, the Municipal Journalists' Association, the Municipal Women's Association, the Municipal Traditional Chinese Medicine Practitioners' Association, and other organizations telegraphed Premier Weng of the Executive Yuan yesterday, supporting measures to eliminate communist spies and stabilize order, stating: "We find that the Communists are selling out the motherland, launching armed rebellion, recognizing thieves as fathers, willingly becoming slaves, and their savage nature has long been deeply resented by the people of the country. Yet they are still unrepentant, using the guise of democracy and freedom, secretly engaging in techniques to harm the country and the people, and creating chaos and destroying society in various rear areas, using every means possible, placing our people under the knife and plunging our compatriots into fire and water. Thinking of this is extremely heartbreaking. The government is bringing solace to the people and suppressing the rebels, and eliminating chaos. Where great righteousness lies, the entire people will follow. However, the communist plots are insidious, penetrating everywhere, using false names and pretenses, enticing the ignorant, deceiving the masses, encouraging the trend, opening up their so-called 'underground front.' If they are not strictly punished, the consequences will be unimaginable. We have recently learned that your Excellency, in view of this, has issued an order to eliminate traitors and stabilize order. This is truly a bright strategy to prevent problems before they occur, and it is urgently needed in this extraordinary period. In addition to sincerely supporting it, our association and others will appeal to people from all walks of life in the city to follow it unanimously, conduct self-rectification, and assist in reporting, so that insidious elements have nowhere to hide, and students and good workers can all be able to settle down in their occupations, and society can be stabilized and secured. Hopefully, everyone will be united and work together to suppress the bandits with all their might and accelerate the completion of the suppression of the rebellion. We respectfully telegraph the facts and hope for your guidance."</p>
<h3>Ten Thousand Tons of Coal Successively Transported to Shanghai; Chamber of Commerce Telegraphs Request to Stop Shipments to Japan</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] Amidst the coal shortage in Shanghai, it is now learned that some coal has been successively arriving in Shanghai. The Huahai vessel, loaded with 5,000 tons of coal from Beijing, arrived in port yesterday. The Anlian vessel, also loaded with 2,000 tons of coal from Beijing, is expected to arrive in Shanghai today. Additionally, the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Haihuang vessel, loaded with 9,500 tons of coal from Qinhuangdao, was originally intended to be transported to Kobe, Japan. Due to the needs of this city, it has also been ordered to be loaded and transported to Shanghai.

<p>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce telegraphed the Executive Yuan yesterday, requesting that coal exports to Japan be stopped.</p>
<h3>Airmail Newspapers and Publications Sent to Chongqing: Volume Limited to Only 300 Kilograms; Post Office Receives Reporters to Explain the Reasons</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] Regarding the temporary suspension of acceptance of airmail newspapers and publications to Chongqing, the Municipal Postal Administration specially received reporters yesterday, and Assistant Director Wang Yuguang of the bureau reported that since last month, China and Central Airlines have reduced the number of flights on various routes due to the lack of gasoline. The company's restrictions on the volume of mail accepted by the post office have also decreased proportionally. The reduction on the Shanghai-Chongqing route is particularly large. There are a total of eight flights per week on this route, and the two companies limit the weekly volume of mail they accept to 2,200 kilograms. According to statistics for July, airmail on the Shanghai-Chongqing route alone for letters and postcards has reached 2,100 kilograms, while newspapers and publications have reached 910 kilograms. The postal service prioritizes letters, followed by newspapers. According to the above statistics, the volume of newspapers and publications is only 100 kilograms. Although the post office has repeatedly negotiated with the airlines, they have only agreed to increase it by 200 kilograms, for a total of 300 kilograms, accounting for one-third of the total demand. This figure also includes the volume on the newly opened Shanghai-Jiujiang-Hankou route. If this route is suspended, the letters will be concentrated on the Shanghai-Chongqing route, and even this one-third may not be able to be transported. Therefore, the post office currently hopes for two things: (1) that the newspaper and magazine publishers will send their mail directly to the airlines; (2) that the volume of airmail newspapers sent by the newspapers will also be automatically reduced to one-third of the July volume. The representatives of the newspapers who attended expressed understanding of the postal service's difficult situation and agreed to report the two suggestions of the post office to the newspaper authorities so that they could collectively negotiate with the airlines.</p>

<h3>[Sweet Girl] Cuts Tongue, Has [Unspeakable] Pain; After Being Sent to the Hospital for Suturing, She Has Recovered</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] Since the "sweet girl" of the film and theater world, Huang Zongying, announced her marriage to the handsome young actor Zhao Dan, she has been working hard day and night on films and plays, and her health has been deteriorating. Moreover, prices are soaring, and life is difficult, causing her to suddenly feel hatred for her artistic career. One morning, she heard Zhao discussing the acting problems of "Beauty Walk" at home, which stirred up her sorrow. Thinking about her current situation, which was entirely due to her participation in theatrical work, and that her ability to enter the film and theater world was entirely due to her "ability to speak well," she suddenly became angry with her "long tongue" and suddenly used scissors to cut off the tip of her tongue, in an attempt to eradicate her troubles. Zhao was shocked to witness this and rushed her to Zhongshan Hospital for suturing. She has recovered as of yesterday, but because the wound has not yet healed, she still seems to have "unspeakable" pain. When reporters asked why she resorted to such a measure, she immediately covered her face with a pre-written note saying "Following doctor's orders, no visitors allowed" and shook her head with a smile. Her entourage explained, "Zongying is still a child at heart!" and added, "She already regrets it now."</p>

They have now discovered that the China-America Pharmacy is also issuing ointments with a "Lion Globe" trademark, which is highly suspected of trademark infringement, and thus filed a lawsuit. Xu Xiangsun, the defendant, did not appear in court yesterday morning due to illness, but Zhang Changjing appeared and stated that the China-America Pharmacy had been using the "Lion Globe" trademark to issue ointments for more than ten years, and had built up a strong reputation, so they did not apply for registration with the Trademark Bureau. The court stated that since the pharmacy's trademark was not registered, it was indeed inappropriate. The defendant Zhang Changjing was ordered to post 3 billion yuan in cash bail and secure two shop guarantees. The hearing was adjourned, and Xu Xiangsun was ordered to appear in court on time.</p>

<h3>Zhenhai Farmers' Association Stipulates Rent Payment Methods: Landlords Urge Authorities to Take Measures to Stop It</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report from Zhenhai, 18th] Gu Jingyong (顧荆庸), Chairman of the Zhenhai County Farmers' Association, called on all tenant farmers in the county in mid-August to pay rent at 8% of the land price in accordance with the Land Law. In areas where the standard land price has not yet been announced, the average land price of the most recent three years will be used as the land price for paying rent. The tenant farmers have also been notified by the Farmers' Association to pay the land tax for the landlords in advance, as the Zhejiang Provincial Government has ordered tenant farmers to pay and deduct it on behalf of the landlords. In addition to issuing a declaration, the Association has also gathered petition representatives from various townships to petition the relevant ministries and commissions of the National Government, the Zhejiang Provincial Government, and the Zhenhai County Government, vowing to achieve their goal. They have also sent people around to promote rent strikes, and any landlord who collects rent will be rejected. Landlords in the county report that the annual land tax is 40 catties of grain per mu (approximately 667 square meters). If the rent payment standard advocated by the Farmers' Association is followed, not only will there be no rent to collect, but more than 20 catties of grain will have to be paid in taxes, affecting the livelihood of all those with land holdings. In addition, education, charity, and public welfare undertakings in the county, which rely on rent revenue for funding, will all be suspended. The entire county is in a state of panic, and people are petitioning the provincial and county governments to quickly stop this, reject the Farmers' Association's unreasonable demands, and continue to use the temporary measures for reducing rent by 25% to appease the people.</p>

<p>(2) Turning over is truly regrettable, teaching people to be cannon fodder.</p>
<p>(3) My family is going to be struggled against, my life cannot be protected, I join the army with tears, who can I tell my sorrows to?</p>
<p>(4) No land, no grain, pots, bowls, and spoons all swept away.</p>
<p>(5) Struggle against landlords, struggle against landlords, the masses' opinions are not the master.</p>
<p>(6) No soldiers at the front, struggles are started in the rear.</p>
<p>(7) Struggling against others is like struggling against oneself, struggling back and forth struggles against oneself, not struggling against family members of the anti-Japanese is unreasonable.</p>
<p>(8) Liu Bocheng, fake equality, he is an official, we are soldiers, he enjoys wealth, we suffer poverty, when the war starts, we sacrifice. (Army song of Liu Bocheng's troops).</p>

<p>(12) Fields all divided, houses torn down, grain leveled, money robbed, patriotic men killed, young men all gone, leaving the people without clothes and socks, the Communist area is dark and without daylight, I hope the Nationalist army will kill them all.</p>
<p>(13) Don't say we have guns, pick up hoes and go to the battlefield, don't say we have no bullets, bricks and tiles can eliminate traitors.</p>
<p>(14) Seeing her son travel thousands of miles, a mother worries, leaving her mother for many days, a son's heart is troubled, a son misses his dear mother but cannot meet, a mother misses her beloved son and tears stream down her face. Raising a son was originally to protect oneself in old age, who knew the "Eighth Route Army" would come, forcing her charming son to join the army, insisting that the old mother say it's good, leaving her hometown to be transferred far away, dying more and living less who to rely on. Hearing that the Nationalist army is coming soon, a chance to seek good fortune in disaster, quickly find a way to find your son, surrender and reform as soon as possible.</p>

<h3>Bearish Forces Exert Pressure, Market Trends Decline Sharply, Many Chinese Stocks Fall to Limit, Securities Exchange Announces Closure for Two Days</h3>
<p>Yesterday, Chinese stocks were extremely fragile. On the eve of the implementation of the new policy, the Nanjing bearish forces arbitrarily released various rumors. The multi-party was simply a disunited crowd, and immediately collapsed. Many popular stocks fell to the limit or close to the limit. Yong Yarn fell below the limit. Only the cement stock rebounded to the limit due to the arrival of paper bags.</p>
<p>In the early morning, people were concerned about the President's return to Beijing and the economic reforms. The market opened unusually weak, with mostly low openings. Yong Yarn opened at 16,800 yuan, and after opening, rose from 16,850 yuan. Due to unusual weakening in the aftermarket, No. 71, No. 145, No. 154, No. 12, No. 56, No. 13, No. 169, No. 102, No. 148, No. 125, No. 94, No. 220, No. 179, No. 61, No. 116, No. 160, and No. 137 were heavily sold, lacking resilience. After 11:00 AM, Xinhuo first fell to the limit, and Yong Yarn also followed, falling to the limit of 15,280 yuan, before being replenished by No. 153, No. 207, No. 107, No. 148, No. 12, No. 134, No. 137, No. 143, No. 102, and No. 56, rising back to 15,750 yuan.

Except for Shanghai Cement, which uniquely closed at the limit, and matches, Tongyi, and Huaxin, which fell only slightly, the remaining stocks unanimously declined by 5% to 10%.</p>
<p>In the afternoon market, the money supply remained excessive. Yong Yarn opened at 15,850 yuan, but soon No. 71, No. 220, No. 152, No. 22, No. 54, No. 4, No. 102, No. 69, No. 99, No. 134, No. 106, and No. 12 hastily closed their positions. Rumors spread that the new policy would be announced that evening, and the brokerages and market would close for three days to wait for the consolidation. Rumors ravaged the multi-party, and Yong Yarn immediately fell to the limit. Xinhuo and Qinxing fell to the limit. No. 176, No. 153, No. 178, and No. 143 maintained, rising to 15,500 yuan. No. 38, No. 16, No. 97, No. 67, No. 145, No. 71, No. 157, No. 4, and No. 190 continued to cut long positions. Meiya also fell to the limit, eventually falling below the limit, reaching a low of 15,120 yuan, struggling at 15,230 yuan at the close. However, after the close, news came that the National Bank had intervened, slightly rising above the limit. Compared to the morning close, Huaxin and Shanghai Cement rose to the limit, China-France fell to the limit and then rebounded, Yong Yarn, Meiya, Xinhuo, and Qinxing fell to the limit, and the rest fell slightly by about 5%. The over-the-counter unlisted stocks were still most popular, such as World.</p>
<p>Government Bonds</p>
<p>Yesterday, hopes for currency reform intensified, reaching new peaks. Class A and B were at 2.2 million, Class C saw 2.91 million, Class D reached 2.3 million, and Class E approached 2.5 million. At the close, they were all closed by the multi-party, ending down slightly by about 10%. Room 552 and Room 550 sold, Room 503, Room 360 and Room 500 bought. Trading volume increased to over 10 million. Except for Class D, which was flat, the rest continued to rise slightly.</p>
<p>Exchange Closure</p>
<p>Also, Shanghai Securities Exchange yesterday issued Market Announcement No. 595: "The bank approved the Central Bank's Shanghai Central Secretariat (37) Letter No. 3012 on August 19 of this year, approving the Ministry of Finance's telegram stating, "It is hereby decided that August 20 and 21 of this year will be temporary holidays for the national banking industry.

The morning opening was due to the firmness of Wuxi, and the owners intended to raise prices, but because the actual sales were slow and the outlet was limited, the price remained at the original level. Later, due to the reports of higher prices for various items outside the industry, people became more nervous and soft, and there were many sellers, so the price slowly declined. In the Nanshi market, white japonica and thin indica rice each fell by 1 million, and the rest were slightly weaker. The prices in the Beishi market were stable, with special high japonica rice standing at 68 million yuan. Yesterday, the total arrival of goods in the North and South markets was 3,532 stones.</p>
<p>Flour fell, actual sales were slow, buyers were hesitant, and the reporter dared not enter rashly in this weak state, so transactions were very idle. Old Car flour fell all the way from 23.1 million to 22.7 million yuan, a decrease of 700,000 yuan. Bingchuan flour was 21.8 million yuan, a decrease of 900,000 yuan. Red Bee and Jiancheng were each at 22 million yuan, each decreasing by 600,000 to 800,000 yuan, and Xiong brand flour also decreased by 600,000 to 700,000 yuan. Bran also decreased by 300,000 to 400,000 yuan, wheat by 31 million yuan, down by 200,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Miscellaneous grains were all weak, because actual sales were sluggish and the buyer's acceptance was narrow. Trade beans fell by 1 million yuan, corn buyers accepted less, and fell sharply by 3 million yuan. The willingness of buyers in Shantou to accept yuan wheat decreased simultaneously, falling sharply by 4 million to 5 million yuan. Broad beans were stable, mung beans fell slightly by 100,000 yuan, sesame transactions were very rare, only local sales, down by 1 million to 2 million yuan, and raw peanut buyers accepted less, with prices falling by 2 million to 3 million yuan.</p>
<p>Edible oil gradually moved downstream. Because the prices of all grains fell, the outlet had already decreased, and because various items outside the industry were also small, people became even more nervous and soft. Soybean oil closed at 156 million yuan, a decrease of 6 million yuan. Rapeseed oil uniquely stood firm, because there was an export outlet, opening at 141 million yuan, rising by 2 million yuan. Raw oil fell by 2 million yuan, and small cart sesame oil fell by 5 million yuan. Soybean cake transactions were sluggish, falling by 700,000 to 800,000 yuan.</p>

<h3>Detailed Rules for Encouraging Overseas Chinese Investment Have Been Approved and Will Be Announced Soon</h3>

<h3>Before the Shanghai Coal Shortage is Resolved, Kailuan Coal Will Temporarily Be Shipped to Japan</h3>
<p>[Our Report] According to a revelation from the Fuel Management Committee, the CITIC Bureau originally intended to ship Kailuan coal to Japan in exchange for wood. Recently, due to the serious coal shortage in Shanghai, the shipment of Kailuan coal would affect the supply of coal in the city. After consultation with the CITIC Bureau, the Fuel Management Committee agreed that before a concrete solution to the coal shortage in Shanghai is found, coal from Qinhuangdao will be shipped to Shanghai first, and the coal for barter with Japan will be supplied to Japan after the coal shortage in the city is resolved.

<h3>Merchants Going to Japan Order Rayon, Limited to 120 Boxes Each Time</h3>
<p>Private trade between our country and Japan is gradually expanding. When selecting imports, most of the private business representatives sent to Japan enjoy purchasing Japanese rayon, because rayon is currently a resource in short supply domestically, and the demand from various silk weaving factories is quite strong. Therefore, the sales of rayon in the country are more guaranteed. Currently, in order to prevent the competitive purchase and sale of Japanese rayon from invisibly raising the value of Japanese rayon, the authorities have specifically limited each trader to purchase no more than 120 boxes of Japanese rayon each time.</p>
<h3>Tea Market Stable</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the buying interest of exporters in the foreign tea market was still strong, but the owners insisted on selling firmly due to the scarcity of goods, so the trend continued to be more demand than supply, and transactions were not active. In terms of price, they all rose higher and higher. Inquiries for domestic tea were also constant, and the market was stable and keen.</p>

<p>Lou Fangao, Chen Yinglang, and others return to Shanghai yesterday</p>
<p>[Our Dispatch] The first batch of personnel from our delegation to the World Games, including Secretary Tian Hanxiang, track and field representatives Lou Wenao, Chen Yinglang, and attendant Wang Zhenglin, left England by plane on the 12th and returned to this place a few days ago. Chen Yinglang will leave Shanghai on the 22nd to return to Taiwan Province and is currently booking plane or ship tickets. Tian Hanxiang decided to return to Beijing tomorrow night. According to Mr. Tian's interview with the Guoguang News Agency yesterday, our World Games delegation will return in five batches.

There are three reasons for this: (1) Strategically, our team is not inferior to other teams, but the offensive and defensive movements are not as fast as the opponents, which is due to unfamiliar coordination. (2) In addition to the five regular players on our team, the new forces have poor technical skills, which has invisibly become a second team. If the champion US team has an average of ten players with technical skills, any five players will become a strong team. Therefore, it is not without reason that they dominate the world. (5) Improper guidance and scheduling cannot escape blame.</p>

<p>Free Talk</p>
<h3>Master Hongyi and Xu Jiyuan</h3>
<p>— Lu Danlin</p>
<p>My literary friend Li Fangyuan came to Fan from Xiamen yesterday and met for several talks. Fangyuan is the great disciple of Hongyi Monk. In the conversation, he naturally talked about Hongyi's anecdotes, which unintentionally reminded me of the story of Hongyi and Xu Huanyuan's life and death, which is a very touching story.</p>
<p>In the biography of Master Hongyi written by Jiang Danshu, there is a passage that says: "He once told Feng Zikai that in the 17th or 18th year of the Republic of China, the Master temporarily lived in his Shanghai residence and chatted about the past. He suddenly wanted to visit Chengnan Thatched Cottage. Zikai accompanied him; when he arrived, the old residence still existed, but the owner had changed, and the Thatched Cottage had been changed to a refined residence; entering, he felt great sorrow for the past and the present, and immediately prostrated himself before the Buddha statue, knocking his head like pounding garlic. The solemn expression, the silence of ten thousand times, the desolate atmosphere, the coldness of the four walls. If my Buddha is spiritual, he should also shed tears of sadness. After knowing that the house had changed hands, he asked where the old owner was. He sincerely sought him, and he found the person. Alas, Xu Huanyuan, the leader of the literary world who was generous and righteous in the past, had white hair and deaf ears, and his haggard state was unbearable to look at, and he was still hiding in a humble room, preparing books for people, exchanging them for a few liters of rice to maintain his livelihood. After meeting, he was greatly saddened again. After a long time, he began to smile through tears, recalling the past, as if a fool was telling a dream. This scene, Zikai, who was sitting with him, couldn't help but wet his beard with tears..." This tragedy, performed by Hongyi who had seen through the dust, precisely showed his profound legal knowledge, his warm friendship, and the full expression of his deep feelings. How could Zikai, who was watching, not shed tears and wet his beard? And Hongyi and Huanyuan, who were involved, each recalling the past, they wanted to cry but had no tears, and could only smile through tears. What a sad and emotional scene!</p>
<p>Xu Huanyuan, whose name is Cai, is from Shanghai. In his early years, he and Cai Xiaoxiang from Baoshan, Yuan Xilian, Zhang Xiaolou from Jiangyin, and Hongyi (who used the name Li Xihe at the time) and others formed a sworn brotherhood. This was thirteen years before the Republic of China, and the location was Chengnan Thatched Cottage on Qinglong Bridge in the city. The following year, they organized the Shanghai Calligraphy and Painting Association at the old site of Yangliu Chess Stand on Fuzhou Road, drinking tea and reading paintings, and publishing a calligraphy and painting newspaper every week. Soon, Zhang Xiaolou was hired by Yangzhou Dongwen Academy, Hongyi entered Nanyang Public School, Xilian entered Guang Fangyan Hall, Xiaoxiang was busy with the hospital, and Huanyuan donated to become an official, so the calligraphy and painting association stopped.</p>
<p>Yuan Xilian's "My Relationship with Da Shi": "...In the 17th year, the Master came to Shanghai and lived in Feng Zikai's house in Jiangwan. I, Xiaolou, and Huanyuan visited him together. At that time, Cai Xiaoxiang had already passed away, and we sighed with emotion, overwhelmed by the feelings of the past and the present. So the four of us took another photo together, and the Master personally inscribed it on it..." This is the same time as recorded by Mei Danshu.</p>
<p>Huanyuan's wife was Ms. Song Mengxian (Zhen), who was skilled in poetry and painting. The couple worshiped Wang Tao and Jiang Biao as teachers. During the Boxer Rebellion in the Gengzi year, Huanyuan and his wife sold their collection of calligraphy and paintings for charity, saving countless people. Ten years before the Republic of China, Huanyuan mourned his wife's death, and his grief was extraordinary. After a few years, he collected inscriptions from domestic literati on the posthumous paintings of Madame Mengxian. At that time, people such as Chen Sanyuan, Yan Fansun, Fan Yunmen, Wu Changshuo, Jiang Guanyun, Chen Renxian, Zhu Jiangcun, and Li Meian all had poems and essays. Hongyi wrote a poem with a small preface, narrating their friendship, which said: "Elder Sister Mengxian learned from Senior Wang Tao, and was able to write articles and poems. She also studied painting with Jing Qing from Ling County, following the family style of Qi Xiang, and was able to obtain its spirit. People at that time praised her for surpassing her teachers. This book was made in the ninth month of the Gengzi year. I was living in Chengnan Thatched Cottage with my mother. During flower mornings and moonlit evenings, my mother always invited Elder Sister to talk about poetry and evaluate paintings, and enjoyed it. Elder Sister was often ill, and my mother treated her with medicine, treating her as her own daughter. On the lotus birthday of the Renyin year, Elder Sister passed away. Three years later, in the Yisi year, my mother also passed away. I then fled overseas and roamed recklessly. Recalling the happy family life and the elegance of singing and harmonizing, it seems like another world. This year, my brother-in-law Huanyuan showed this painting and asked me to write a poem. I grieve for the dead who cannot be resurrected and mourn for the living who have many difficulties, so I compose a short poem to express my sorrow." After reading this small preface, you will know that they were sworn brothers and sisters with different surnames, and their feelings were like flesh and blood. The poem says: "Life is like a dream, sadness and joy reach the heart. Shanghai is left with two lines of tears, chanting into an autumn evening. Kind clouds are in the sky, the bright moon is in the south building. There is no longevity in the world, only a few feathers of Dan Qing remain."</p>
<p>Beautiful women have short lives, famous scholars are bumpy, and Hongyi became a monk as a noble son. The events of the past thirty years, joys and sorrows, separations and reunions, are like a dream. A close friend with deep affection like Master Hongyi naturally couldn't help his "great sorrow" and "smiling through tears." And now, of their fifty-year sworn brothers, only Zhang Xiaolou and Yuan Xilian remain. In recent years, there have been wars and species development in Shanghai. Some write calligraphy and paintings, and some are lawyers, spending their twilight years.</p>
<h3>Ode to Passing Jiayuguan</h3>
<p>— Wang Ziyun</p>
<p>I remember passing Shanhaiguan in the east in the past, the border wind blew the moon and illuminated the group, Ju Yong stood on his horse and looked down at Shanggu, grape grapes were piled up with jade plates. Embracing the sound of the ascending car, climbing Yanmen, the inside and outside are divided into Yin and Yang at dawn and dusk, flying far west to Jiayu North, the vast plain is boundless. Meng Gong's Great Wall; horizon, even today the ruins are broken and there are still five thousand miles left; my life is long and I work hard, and I have seen the vicissitudes of life and become a person from east to west, north and south! The insects, sand, apes, and cranes have experienced the dust, crossing the mountains and passes that I am used to; trying to travel with the wind, laughing and pointing at Tianshan to share a white head.</p>
<h3>Picnic at Swallow Nest and Dance Party</h3>
<p>A long journey to "Ula Bai", a short stay in "Swallow Nest", a good try at the demon dance under the sky, a real dance on the ground.</p>
<p>An old man with a loud voice has relics, flowing water and high mountains write their own hearts, Wang Zhenjin's emblem is different from the Chinese land, copper silk gently strokes the six-stringed Qin.</p>

<h3>The First Luxurious Giant Liner of the Contemporary Era, "Queen Elizabeth"</h3>
<p>— Lan Xin</p>
<p>So far, the largest and most luxurious ship in the world is the British mail ship "Queen Elizabeth". This ship weighs 83,673 tons, is 1,031 feet long, has 14 decks, and has 650 motors of various sizes. The current generated is enough for a small city of more than 100,000 people.</p>
<p>The first-class cabins on the ship all have heating and cooling equipment, bathrooms, and wireless telephones. Passengers can pick up the phone and make calls to any major city in the world.</p>
<p>The ship has two movie theaters, two swimming pools, three gyms, twelve bars, and even Turkish bath facilities. In addition, there are three libraries with 4,000 books printed in 14 different languages. There are also three banks, six shops, beauty salons, and barbershops.</p>
<p>The ship's medical equipment is extremely complete, with a large operating room for performing surgical operations, a regular hospital, and an isolation hospital.</p>
<p>The ship needs to prepare more than 10,000 meals a day, so it must prepare all kinds of food itself. Washing clothes is also an amazing task. Every time it crosses the Atlantic between England and America, the laundry room of the "Queen Elizabeth" needs to wash 10,000 sheets, 20,000 napkins, and 70,000 towels.</p>
<p>When World War II broke out, the "Queen Elizabeth" was not yet completed and was the best bombing target for German bombers. For safety reasons, the British side hurriedly let it risk crossing the Atlantic Ocean full of submarines and sailed to New York in the United States to moor. This was March 2, 1940, the maiden voyage of the "Queen Elizabeth".</p>
<p>In November of the same year, it was ordered to sail to Singapore and converted into a transport ship. Since then, it has continuously transported troops and made great achievements. When the Japanese army spied on Australia, the "Queen Elizabeth" once loaded American soldiers to Australia. It can carry 2,314 passengers in peacetime, but it can carry as many as 15,600 soldiers when transporting troops.</p>
<p>Once, a confused American soldier told his companion on the ship: "Ah, of course only we Americans have this kind of ship. The British will be envious!"</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, this sentence was heard by the captain, Sir Bisse. He immediately ordered the brief history of the Elizabeth to be written down and hung in the public notice area, so that everyone would know that this ship was indeed the product of the British Empire. ,</p>
<p>German submarines certainly did not want to let go of such an excellent moon target, but the "Queen Elizabeth", although large, was extremely flexible and fast, able to travel 30 nautical miles per hour. Those submarines were finally helpless. Hitler also specially issued a reward, and the submarine crew who could sink the ship could receive the highest honor medal of the German army and an additional reward of 200,000 US dollars. But later, checking the records of the German Navy, only one submarine had seen the "Queen Elizabeth" in the refracting telescope - and the submarine's mines had just been used up, so it had to watch it sail away safely.</p>
<p>Hitler's reward was only 200,000 US dollars, but now that the "Queen Elizabeth" has been restored, it can earn 1.3 million US dollars for each round trip between England and America.</p>
<h3>War and Peace</h3>
<p>— Rong Dong</p>
<p>According to the "World Digest": In the past 34 centuries, there were:</p>
<p>3100 years of war;</p>
<p>277 years of peace;</p>
<p>8000 peace treaties.</p>
<h3>Noble and Cheap</h3>
<p>— Mei</p>
<p>Bali in the Dutch East Indies is a place with extremely beautiful scenery, and the local girls are especially famous for their fitness. The residents of that island have two strange sayings about twins, one male and one female. The first saying is popular among the nobles, who believe that this pair of children must have been loving couples in their previous lives, so they are still unwilling to separate when they are reincarnated, which is really commendable. The second saying is popular among the common people, which is exactly the opposite of the previous saying. They believe that this pair of babies has committed the great sin of incest before they were born, which is simply a misfortune for the family, so the parents of the pair of children must fast and atone for their sins, spending a lot of money.</p>
<h3>Experiences in Quiet Sitting (3)</h3>
<p>— Jiang Wenyu</p>
<p>Now, every time I practice quiet sitting, I silently count my breaths four hundred times. Because each session takes fifteen minutes, completing four sets—four hundred breaths—takes exactly one hour. Also, when sitting in a single lotus position, my lower leg on the right side inevitably becomes numb. I now have a considerable amount of experience with this. Generally, I start to feel the numbness after about thirty minutes, so I switch legs. Therefore, I switch my legs once every time I practice quiet sitting, which has now become a regular habit.</p>
<p>In addition, I have another experience: when first learning to practice quiet sitting, one must sit in the lotus position. After a long time, one can sit on a chair with the legs dangling, which is also acceptable. Recently, I occasionally sit outdoors to enjoy the cool air, close my eyes, and stretch my back. This can also eliminate distracting thoughts. Practicing deep, subtle breathing for an hour makes my abdomen feel warm as usual.</p>
<p>Also, a large amount of saliva is produced in the mouth during quiet sitting. This can also be considered an unusual phenomenon. In my experience, more saliva is produced during evening or afternoon sessions, while very little is produced during morning sessions.</p>
<p>I believe that what I have said above is extremely honest and objective. Unfortunately, I have not been able to record the unusual phenomena I have discovered in detail in my diary. From September 1st of this year, I have decided to prepare a form and use it to record everything daily.</p>
<p>The Effects of Quiet Sitting</p>
<p>Next, I will discuss the effects of quiet sitting further. For example, Jiang Zhu Lao, at the advanced age of seventy-six, has been practicing quiet sitting for more than fifty years. He still has sharp ears and eyes, and strong legs and feet. He teaches, writes articles, and handles various matters every day, just like a middle-aged person. He is, of course, an excellent role model. However, I must not forget the topic. The effects discussed here should be limited to my personal experiences. I have long suffered from high blood pressure. What is the effect of quiet sitting on this condition? I might as well speak in detail: At the end of May in the 35th year of the Republic (1946) when I was in Hangzhou, I had a medical examination. My blood pressure was only 175. At that time, I had only been practicing quiet sitting for a month. In May of the 36th year of the Republic (1947), after another examination, it was found that it had increased to 190. At this time, I had been practicing quiet sitting for a year. How can this be explained? Originally, I had already experienced that my blood pressure was not always high; sometimes it was high, and sometimes it was low. In other words, it was high when the condition flared up, and low when it did not. I myself am clear about when the old condition flared up and when it did not. When the condition flares up, I definitely feel a little dizzy, and there is some numbness in my left leg and left arm (only a small part). My body is not very comfortable. According to my experience, the duration of this phenomenon varies. In Chongqing in the 30th year of the Republic (1941), it sometimes lasted for as long as ten days or a week. That can be considered the longest period. In the 31st year of the Republic (1942), I left Chongqing and moved to Meitan County in eastern Guizhou Province to rest and recuperate, doing nothing, and I felt much better. When the condition flared up, it only took two or three days to recover. I returned to Shanghai in April of the 35th year of the Republic (1946), and it has been almost two and a half years since then. In the first year and a half, it still flared up about every thirty or forty days, but the duration was very short, and the severity of the condition was very mild. In the past year, the interval between flare-ups has gradually increased, and the severity has also become milder. From this, it can be understood that the examination in the 35th year of the Republic (1946) showed only 175 because it happened to be when the condition was not flaring up, while the examination in the 36th year of the Republic (1947) showed 190 because it was precisely when the old condition was flaring up. In the past year, I have been teaching at school, giving two lectures in a row without feeling tired at all. When writing articles, thinking and using my brain, I can continue for three or four hours without feeling particularly dizzy or mentally exhausted. As the ancients said, "Like a person drinking water, one knows whether it is cold or warm." This is my personal experience. Now I can confidently say that before returning to Shanghai, the gradual reduction in high blood pressure was due to rest. After returning to Shanghai, the gradual reduction in high blood pressure seems to be partly attributable to quiet sitting. This is the first effect. Also, I used to be prone to catching colds, often sneezing and having a runny nose unintentionally when exposed to cold air, followed by swelling and congestion of the nasal cavity, and even extending to the throat and trachea. However, in the past year and a half, this has not happened. Also, indigestion used to be a common occurrence, but it is no longer the case. This can be considered the second effect. Moreover, sometimes when I overwork my brain and feel tired, or have a slight discomfort in my head, I immediately go to practice quiet sitting. After sitting for an hour or fifty minutes, when I get up again, I feel exceptionally comfortable and completely return to normal. What is especially pleasing to me is that after practicing quiet sitting in the evening, as soon as my head hits the pillow, I fall soundly asleep without any dreams. This can also be considered the third effect.</p>
<p>These are roughly the types of experiences I have been able to have since I started practicing quiet sitting.</p>
