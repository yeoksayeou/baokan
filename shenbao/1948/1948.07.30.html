<h3>莫干山上冠蓋雲集　翁文灝俞鴻鈞王雲五王世杰均抵山　總統召宴垂詢財經問題</h3>
<p>〔本報莫干山廿九日電〕蔣總統廿九日竟日禾出遊山。翁文灝·王雲五·徐柏圍·嚴家淦·王世杰今日奉召聯袂抵此，王世杰並携其公子王紀五同來。翁氏等係於午後一時乘專機自京起飛，三時許抵杭，即換乘汽車，逕駛莫千山，於六時許到達山上。總統於晚八時召見翁等，並留共進晚餐，對目前財政經濟金融等問題作廣泛諮詢。翁等於十時許始辭出，當晚宿莫干山飯店又兪鴻鈞奉召廿九日下午自滬抵杭，旋即上山。</p>
<p>兪總裁鴻鈞於今晚六時在莫干山飯店接見本報記者，記者以大鈔發行後一般情形相詢，渠表示目前物價已趨顯著之穩定，其所以能獲致如此成就，實由於政府四大決策：（一）收縮通貨，（二）拋售物資，（三）平衡外匯，（四）吸收僑匯。諸項已澈底實施，且八月中美援物資將大批到來，故物價更無理由再事上漲。渠對立法院近通過限制增發通貨案，表示物價之漲原因甚多，通貨僅爲原因之一。渠今來此後，曾晋謁總統，總統對上海物價，金融問題，及對逮捕市塲投機份子如何處理事，垂詢甚詳。</p>
<p>〔本報莫干山廿九日電〕翁文灝等六人今日奉召抵此，六時半上山，住莫干山飯店。新任浙省警保處長毛森亦同來，住林海別墅。渠等抵此後，即對本報記者作簡單之談話。翁謂此來係舉召，兼爲避暑。王雲五稱：財產稅案此次未獲通過，下次將再作討論，至於救濟特捐募集事宜，決儘本月底前結束。徐柏園表示：美援到來後，應節約運用，渠並認爲收縮通貨對生產決無影響。王世杰盛讚莫干山之景色秀麗，並稱：此處與廬山之壯偉正可相互總美。是後，記者婉轉詢翁院長，莫干山可否代廬山成爲今年夏都？翁笑答不知。</p>
<p>〔本報莫干山廿九日電〕蔣經國夫婦偕公子等，昨登莫干山，向總統及夫人敬候起居。中午，總統家人團聚用餐，蔣經國於當晚下山，諸孫留山侍候。總統對孫愛護備至，並詢孫兒功課及如何遊息。總統對莫干山建設頗多指示，吿王局長：塔山應造林，若干地方應作畜牧塲。今晨總統衣黑香雲紗便裝，躺於籐椅上，面對陽光，顧盼附近晨景。有村農二十餘人來山，要求簽字蒙准，歡躍而去，宣鐵吾來謁，總統垂詢滬市政治經濟情形甚詳，並對工作加以指示。宣氏公畢，即下山赴杭轉滬。（宣氏抵滬消息，請參閱第四版）</p>
<p>〔中央社莫干山廿九日電〕中央銀行總裁兪鴻鈞，於廿九日下午四時到達莫干山，當即晋謁總統述職。據兪氏語記者：本行自發行較大面額鈔券以後，政府乃緊縮銀根，拋售物資，故一度引起波浪之物價，不久即吿穩定，此次發行較大面額之鈔券，係因各地鈔劵缺乏，工商業周轉困難，實爲應付事實需要，僅將鈔券面額提高，並非增加發行數量，此應特別聲明者。最近實施外匯結匯證明書辦法，對於吸收僑匯頗有成效。兪氏並謂：就一般經濟情况，頗可樂觀。</p>
<p>〔本報本市訊〕兪鴻鈞奉總統電召，昨晨由京返滬後，即轉赴杭州，專程往莫干山晋謁總統。兪氏此行，除述職之外，傳將就今後金融物價之管制，詳盡提供意見，以便當局法定方案，統一指揮今後之物價管理。</p>

<p>〔中央社南京廿九日電〕董顯光局長廿九日在記者招待會中，答復記者關於政府改變管理僑匯辦法已有多種報道，請見示現行辦法詳情之詢問時稱：所詢者想係指政府最近公布之「僑資及國人在外資金投資國內生產事業申請輸入辦法」，此項辦法全文，昨已公布，其主要目的在鼓勵僑資及國人在外資金歸國，從事本國生產事業，我國推行管制外匯之政策，雖收效甚宏，而對國內工業需要或難免有未能充分顧及之處，爲適應工業方面需要，俾促進生產，爰有本辦法之頒行，此項辦法之精神，要言之，可得下列三點：（一）凡舉辦之事業，爲國內所需要者，其所需機器設備等，准予輸入。（二）爲維持現有事業所需之原料，准歸國僑資順帶物資輸入，此點亦有兩層意義其一爲保障投資者本身幣値，其二爲補充現有事業所不敷之原料。（三）過去商人間有假借華僑名義，由國外輸入利益甚厚之奢侈品，故本辦法中對此種可能情形，不得不加嚴格防制，深信本辦法之實施，必能切合實際需要，而申請手續亦非繁複，主管機關當儘量予申請人以有效之便利。</p>
<p>次之，本辦法亦爲配合美援之一種自助計劃，美援之數量，雖屬相當鉅大，然其不敷於需要，亦甚明顯。中國深感美國之盛意，同時亦明瞭本身之責任，運用所有之資財以適應目前之經濟環境，是故深盼此項新辦法能吸收大量國人之外資，用於國內之生產事業。</p>
<p>抗戰期間，政府會以最大決心，使抗戰與建國並進，政府今日持有同樣決心，以解決經濟上之困難問題。</p>
<h3>胡適談話　戡建會無成立必要　國代不應支取歲費　召開臨時國大實不妥當</h3>
<p>〔本報北平廿九日電〕胡適頃對戡亂建國委會應否成立，及國代應否支歲費，曁應否召開國大問題，發表評論稱：目前情形下，戡亂建國委會實無成立必要，此機構之成立，對戡建工作進行並無補益。至國代歲費，本人亦認爲絕對不應支取，蓋國代均係社會有地位人士，其本身已有職業，有固定收入，不應再向政府取薪，增加人民負担。至召開臨時國大，商議修憲，更無必要，一部憲法好壞，必須經過相當時期的實驗，才知能道它的長短利弊，然後才能着手修改。我們的憲法，才貢行幾個月，利幣未見，就要召開臨時國大，實在不妥當。</p>

<p>專論</p>
<h3>論自私　鄭華熾</h3>
<p>人類許許多多的罪惡，全是由於自私而產生。就整個世界來說，無疑的，現在的世界已形成了兩個大集團，一個是以美國爲領袖的民主集團，一個是以蘇聯爲領袖的共產集團，美蘇兩國在那裏爭雄，弄得全世界的人不安。在遺傳學沒有確定世界上各民族的智慧·能力眞正是有分別以前，我們只有承認顏子的話是對的：「舜何人也，予何人也，有爲者亦若是。」人類的智慧與能力旣然是一樣的，爲什麽美蘇兩國一定要爭雄而使全世界都不安呢？我的回答是：美蘇兩國全是太自私。再就中國來說，中國政治的腐敗，官吏的貪汚，亦是由於自私的心理而慢慢演成的。中國政治舞台上的人物，幾十年來，選來選去總出不了那些個人物。難道那些個獨霸中國政治舞台二十多年的人物，眞正的有本事，有才略嗎？我看不然。國事弄到這樣的糟糕，人民困苦到這樣的田地，我不敢說他們要負全責，但是最低限度亦應學英法政治家的作風，自動引退，好讓新人來嘗試。政治是有機體，亦需要新陳代謝作用。政治已腐敗，就應該輸入新血。但是中國情形就不然，全國人民都在大聲疾呼：「要變，要大變！要改革，要大改革！」而實際上變來變去還是那些舊人。爲什麼呢？我的回答亦是「自私」二字。自私一詞究竟應該怎樣解釋，我先下一個定義：「凡是損人利己的行為，都呌做自私。」自私的行為，一定是損人的，但是不一定就利已，有時候甚至於損已。譬如戰爭，結果總是兩敗俱傷。人顚何以有自私的心理和行為呢？我看是由于兩個動機而產生的：（一）爲求生存，（二）由于懶惰。</p>
<p>第一，人類想生存，必須要具備幾種最低限度的條件：如衣，食，住，行及娛樂的滿足。地球上各處天然資源的分佈是很不均勻的。一個國家有的東西，別的國家常常是缺乏，甚至於完全沒有，於是互相爭奪，結果造成人類歷史上最悲慘的世界大戰。在第一次世界大戰以後，德國人的宣傳標語是「一個沒有空間的民族。」意思是說，德意志民族沒有空間，無法生存。於是德國人的口號是「我們爲求生存。我們必須爭取空間一這就是第二次大戰發生的重要原因。</p>
<p>爲解決人類生存所必需的條件，最合理的辦法是人類本互助的精神，彼此帮助，以物換物。如此，則生存所必需的物品，大家都可以有，人人全得到豐衣足食，安居樂業，世界的料紛，自然可以消除，大規模的戰爭，自然可以滅絕。這是人類最高的理想，一時也許不容易做到。這樣最理想的辦法旣然一時做不到，則人類只有退而求其次。天然資源的種類和數量雖然是有限，但是物質的變化是無窮的。我們應用科學的知識，工業的技術，可以把某幾種的物質，化合而成爲一種新物質，就是化學上所謂「綜合產物」。在第二次世界大戰的時候，德國人利用植物織維來製造衣料，利用煤來製造汽油，利用碳氫化合物來製造橡皮替代物，解決了許多的困難問題。美國人在第二次世界大戰中的新發明，比德國人更多，成績更好。美國的人造橡皮，在一九三九年年產不過六百七十萬磅，到了一九四二年就增加到四億磅，在短短的三年中增加了六十倍。美國的人造橡皮，在數量上不但比德國的多，就是在質量上也比德國的好。美國是汽車工業最發達的國家，橡皮在汽車工業的重要，人所共知。據美國一般科學家的說法，美國人在第二次世界大戰中最大的貢獻是人造橡皮的成功，這話是一點也不錯的。人類如果能够互助，交換物資，則彼此都不感到物資的缺乏；或者利用已有的原料，來製造缺乏的東西，則物質缺乏的問題，仍然可以解決。生存所需的條件，全都能够具備，自私的心理與行爲，應該可以剷除。</p>
<p>第二，人類有一種惡習，就是什麽都想吃現成飯，用現成的東西，不肯費神法想，費時去找，費力去做。換句話說，就是懶惰。懶惰的人最自私。矯正懶惰的病，就我個人看來，最好的方法，莫過於提倡科學的精鉀。科學的發達，並不是一朝一夕所能達到的，更不是一兩個人的力量所能做到的。科學的發明是由於許許多多的科學家，犧牲畢生的精力，一步一步的把問題研究，一點一點的把經驗儲積，前人未完的工作，後人繼續的研究，經驗積够了，自然會有新的發現。有些懶人認爲科學的發明是偶然的事，其實人家是天天在那裏想，時時在那裏工作，熟能生巧，才是科學發明的主要原因。偶然的發現，不過是　人自欺欺人的說法罷了。細菌　的始祖巴斯　有句名言，就是。「工作，工作，永遠的工作！」最能代表科學家的精神！</p>
<p>中國經過八年的長期抗戰，元氣大傷，肚會秩序破壤，生產事業停頓，以致社會情形不安，人民生計日苦，這是戰爭的後果，戰勝者與戰敗者同受其殃，英法尙且如此，何况中國？物質損失，容易補償，不足憂慮。在中國現在情形之下，最使人感覺憂慮的是全國各階級人員的普遍自私。中國現在一般人的思想與行爲，全存着一種極壞的念頭，只要是於自己有利的事，全可以做，更明目張胆的做。做後的結果怎樣，是否於社會有害，於國家有害，一概不加考慮。社會是有機　，造成社會的細胞是公民，公民自己不好，社會當然不會像樣子。現在一般人不自已檢討，自己反省，反而天天責備社會，這不是反乎其本嗎？</p>
<p>我在這裏論自私，不是以宗敎家或道德家的眼光來做立塲。宗敎家勸人爲善，以上帝的處罰作警戒，未免迷信；道德家勸人爲善，說是你如果品行好，道德高，則世人都要景仰你，未免迂腐。我是以學科學的人的立塲來勸人。科學的精神在提倡合作，尊重理智。大家一心一德的合作，一切的問題都可以解決，常常利用理智，則絕對不會做出損人利己的事。這是做人的最低條件，也可以說是人類是高的理想。</p>

<h3>貸直稅署合併　逃稅可減少</h3>
<p>國稅署長姜書閣談話</p>
<p>〔中央社南京廿九日電〕我國稅制改革工作，即將次第完成。財政部貨物稅與直接稅兩署合併爲國稅署之程序，已在辦理中。各省市縣之機構，亦已命令迅速合併。據新任國稅署長姜書閣稱，貨物稅及直接稅合併以後，可使機構縮减，事權集中，在互相協調之下，定呵减少逃稅數目，而加增稅收。例如紗廠之經營，在原料之使用方面，因有駐廠員辦理貨物稅之征收，可參考其原料使用之數目，而估計其營業概况，因此，逃稅機會，自可减少。我國貨物稅收，在戰前僅居國稅中之次要地位，絕不及國稅收入之大宗。但戰時及戰後，因主持者之努力，巳將稅收之數目大爲增高，而佔國稅中之第一位。今以貨物稅之良好基礎擴及於直接稅方面，今後稅收之增加當爲想象中之事。</p>

<h3>吳鐵城論東南亞局勢　主予土著自治權　蘇聯外交政策「進二步退一步」</h3>
<p>〔合衆社南京廿九日電〕國民黨秘書長吳鐵城廿九日接見合衆社記者，討論東南亞局勢時稱：殖民國家應立即允許各民族建立自治政府，以阻遏共產主義之膨脹。</p>
<p>渠稱：「在政治上，殖民國家將利用騷動和不穩定，以延遲實現彼等對土著民族之諾言——建立自治政府及獨立，但赤色份子將繼續煽動土著民族革命，以推翻統治勢力，然後，在經濟上此等區域內之豐富資源，將自民主國家間失去一。「故唯一解決東南亞問題之方法，即爲賦予土著民族以自治權，協助彼等建立堅强之政府，此舉將有效地阻止共產黨的宣傳，深入與　覆政府之活動」。</p>
<p>吳氏述及中國之地位時稱：「中國爲抵抗世界共產主義之先鋒，正如在第二次世界大戰中，抵抗法西斯然。」</p>
<p>渠稱：中國共產黨對狄托之譴責，毫無疑意地證實中共「係第三國際在中國之代理人，爲世界共產主義而戰」。目前中國之戰爭，爲愛國者對受外國策動的共產侵略之殊死戰」。</p>
<p>當詢以對柏林危機之觀點，吳氏稱：「蘇聯正如第二次大戰前之德國，處處在政治上取得主動，並採取侵略政策，當渠獲得渠所希望之一半後，渠可能覓取協議，以待在新行動中獲得剩下之一半」。</p>
<p>渠形容蘇聯之外交政策爲：「進二步，退一步」。</p>

<h3>英外相文在下院宣布停止復員應付大局　蘇陛當局如具有和平誠意願與之談判整個歐洲問題</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕倫敦廿九日廣播：英外相貝文在西方盟國以新方式照會蘇聯前數小時，廿九日在下院發表演說稱，英國一部份復員計劃已因柏林危機而宣告停頓，但如蘇聯解除柏林封縮，當開始與蘇聯談判整個歡洲問題。渠謂封縮一經解除，當即準備召開四强外長會議。如何排除談判之障礙，實爲當務之念。貝文又稱，蘇聯在柏林之政策如一意孤行，勢必引起織爭，英政府決採任何適當措置以應付大局。渠承認因蘇聯政策之執行，柏林及德國局勢將愈益困難，但「余不信戰時盟友之政策，必非促成使用武力之局面不可者。」貝氏稱，蘇聯指責爲造成目前危機之柏林通貨問題，西方國家固隨時準備與蘇聯商討之。「苟非使用威脅手段，凡足以引起四國政府間困難之任何問題，吾人均樂與蘇聯以談判方式謀合理解決」。貝文稱，四國會議之範圍且可加以擴大而包括其他問題。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕倫敦廿九日廣播：貝文在下院發表英國已將一部份復員計劃停止之聲明後，邱吉爾提出質問謂，英國現仍進行復員，每月兩萬人。邱氏要求貝文提供停止一切復員計劃之保證，貝文答稱，此事正由政府考慮中，日內必可決定云。</p>
<p>〔合衆肚倫敦廿九日電〕美駐蘇大使史密斯及貝文私人機書秘書羅伯茲，廿九日同機離柏林赴莫斯科，俾與法駐蘇大使契泰諾聚首，依原定計劃，三人將聯合要求與莫洛托夫會見。史密斯旣爲西方駐蘇使節之首，故將宣讀西方文吿，向莫洛托夫口頭表示西方之意見。然後擬聽取莫氏之任何意見，臨行則將備忘錄遞交與莫洛托夫。西方盟國雖竭力守秘，其計劃之甚多部份巳形洩露。此間再三考慮時，外部强調遲遲不發之原因在於法國之閣潮。消息絕對靈通人士稱，對蘇覆文所以遲延之原因，實由於英國對照會之程序及形式頗有難色。</p>
<h3>多瑙河航運自由會議今日在南都揭幕　蘇陛由維辛斯基率代表團出席</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社普拉格廿九日電〕蘇聯參加在員爾格勒召開之多瑙河會議代表團，由蘇外次維辛斯基率領，今日抵達捷京晋拉格。捷外長克萊門蒂斯特親往飛機塲歡迎渠等。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社倫敦廿九日電〕多瑙河會議將於明日在貝爾格勒揭幕，英國外交界對此會議能否獲有效果，極爲懷疑，該會議除英蘇美法四國代表出席外，尙有烏克籣·羅馬尼亞·匈牙利·南斯拉夫·捷克·奧地利六賠償國代表，奧代表則以觀察員資格列席。希臘在最後一分鐘申請參加會議，頗使英國權要爲離，因美蘇法英四國於一九四六年十二月七日簽定之多瑙河會議協定，並未將希臘列入也。該會議之目的，乃在如貝文外相於一九四六年十月間在巴黎會議中所發之宣言，使多瑙河之航行如海上之自由。戰爭以前通過中歐與東歐之該河東西兩段間，曾有輪船三千五百艘航行其中，屬於六賠償國者二千四百艘，自一九四五年起實際已完全停駛。近因蘇聯封鎖自德奧美佔領區駛出之船隻之結果，致使中歐各國失此與南德及奧國　接之理想的河道。消息靈通之英人各界認爲蘇聯未必願取銷對該河之封鎖，因蘇聯已向多瑙河各國聲明彼等不能沾美國援助之惠也。惟外交界預料，如蘇聯與其衛星國態度執拗，則多瑙河全案將提交四强外長會議處理之，因西方列强在此會議中，不致有佔少數之虞也。</p>
<h3>柏林市議會開會　共黨議員退席　蘇故意造成分裂</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕倫敦廿九日廣播：柏林市參議會本日在緊張空氣中舉行會議，在通過譴責蘇聯封鎖柏林之議案以前，共黨參議員聯袂退出會塲，蘇聯報紙曾警吿此項會議將引起洗血。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社柏林廿八日電〕由柏林市議會委任繼任馬克格拉夫而爲柏林警察長之史頓蔓，今晚在柏林美佔區就職。渠宣稱，以後關於柏林警蔡之各項命令，由渠頒發，然在新命令頒佈前，原有法令仍屬有効。</p>
<p>〔中央社柏林廿八日合衆電〕柏林市長施略德女士，頃率直拒絕接受蘇聯所驅使警察局長馬克格拉夫復職之命令。施氏致函此間蘇軍事長官稱，「余如接受蘇方之要求，余之行爲將違犯柏林旣訂之規章，並與余之就職宣誓詞牴觸」。</p>
<h3>南匈交惡　匈國任意捕人　具有政治意味</h3>
<p>〔合衆社布達佩斯廿八日電〕可靠方面廿八日披露：匈政治警察已逮捕南斯拉夫公使館新聞參贊鮑洛夫，渠與親共產情報局之南國學生一名被殺案有關。數日以前，應匈牙利之正式邀謂，南使館官員二人陪同鮑氏至匈京政治警察總局，鮑氏當即被捕。匈官員廿八日對此拒絕發表意見，南使館亦僅謂鮑氏現在匈京，但不在公使館內。據可靠方面息，鮑氏被陪往總局後，即被單獨引往別室查問，然後即吿被捕。同時，南斯拉夫曾向匈抗議匈政府反對匈境內南族聯合會之措　，但巳　匈牙利之駁，請此舉爲「對僑內　之不正當干涉」。</p>
<h3>澳外長主張　迅與日締和約</h3>

<p>〔合社倫教廿八日電〕澳外長伊瓦特廿八日在記者招待會中承認，在蘇聯與西方盟國對柏林事件發生爭執期間，對日和約即永無締結之可能。伊氏承認締結對日和約之機會甚爲渺茫，但謂此項和約之籌結「乃急迫之事」。伊氏談稱：「結結日本和約之再三遷延，大部份由於一般　　情勢，尤以歐洲精勢爲甚。」渠强調稱，澳洲正担心於澳洲有被馬歇爾計劃遺忘之可能。提及屬來亞騷擾事件時，伊氏談稱，屬來亞當局疋與英澳政府合作，　力　淸馬來亞之恐怖份子。</p>

<h3>熱烈擁護狄托聲中南共黨大會結束　政府三領袖重行當選中執委</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社貝爾格勒廿九日電〕南共大會在全體擁護狄托元帥與共產情報騙斷絕關係後，即於今日宣吿閉幕。大會反駁共產情報局對狄托之譴責，不獨將狄托並且將其他同受情報局　責之三南共領袖重行當選爲中執委。狄托今日致閉幕辭稱，「予代表新選舉之中執會感謝話君對吾等所表示之信任，吾人必有以酬答君等所委諸吾人之責任。」此次演辭受到各代表一致之鼓掌。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社貝爾格勒廿九日電〕官方頃宣佈狄托元帥重行當選爲南共黨中執委，同時被共產情報局開除之南副總理卡台爾奇·內長蘭柯維基·不管都部長吉拉斯等三人亦重行當選。南共大會以秘密投票選舉其六十三名新中執委，係於廿八日舉行。此次新中執委中，共包括知識分子卅三名，工人廿九名及農人一名。又新中執委中有廿四名係職業革命家，在二次大戰以前渠等即曾爲南共黨員達十七年之久。據外國觀察家意見，現統率南斯拉夫軍隊之將領中，如參謀總長波波維奇，及貝爾格勒解放者及南國坦克專家之達希維克將軍，（渠之名字最近會見諸報端，謂史達林欲以渠代替狄托）皆未有人提出中執會，使渠等担任委員。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社貝爾格勒廿八日電〕南典大會今日通過動議，聲明共產情報局之譴責爲「不符事實，且非公正。」又一致通過動議，贊成中委會對付蘇聯布爾什維克黨責言之態度，並聲明南共並未放棄馬克斯主義與列甯主義之原則。表決後全塲一致起立高唱國際歌。</p>
<h3>分籌組新閣　排除共產黨</h3>
<p>〔合衆社海爾辛　九日電〕芬籣總統巴西基維今授權新總理弗哥霍姆，在其新政府中，排斥共黨。總統雖避免提出共黨，但渠對弗哥霍姆稱，內閣並不一定要包括國內三大政黨在內，此三大政黨即爲農民黨，社民黨及共黨。弗哥霍姆（社會民主黨）遂立即宣佈：渠將第一步嘗試組成社會民主黨農民黨之聯合內閣，如此項計劃失敗，則渠將組縱社會民主黨的一黨內閣。</p>
<h3>英倫及北德上空英美空軍大演習</h3>
<p>〔合衆社倫敦廿九日電〕美英兩國空軍之重轟炸機，今日在英倫及德國上空作戰後第一次大舉出動。美超空堡壘六十架及英國林肯式·蘭加斯特式及蚊子式飛機四十架，將參加英倫及希哥蘭島天空之日夜轟炸演習。美超空堡壨將飛越英倫上空。英空軍轟炸機司令部之部隊將於廿九晚離機場及轟炸德沿岸北海上之希哥蘭島之廢墟。該項機羣歸返時，將穿越莫福克海岸之探海燈，及與夜間戰鬥機作假想攻擊。</p>
<h3>美參院討論杜魯門建議反對派策動拖拉戰　塔虎脫廣播演說極盡議剌能事</h3>
<p>〔合衆社華感頓廿九日電〕美參院廿九日討論人權法案時，反對派擬發表長篇演股。企圖加以阻撓。然三方面人士對某一折衷方案頗感興趣，雖迄無動靜。南部民主黨人稱，在長期辯論反選舉稅法案之援，彼等準備發動拖拉戰衛。按共和黨參議員即選定反納稅投票法案，策動攤　戰。南部參議員已推斯登尼斯領導辯論，其背後有二十名左右參議員一致決定以冗長演說置法案於死地。</p>
<p>參議院拖拉戰一開始，殆將費時無算，而其他國會委員會則將研究杜魯門總統所提之其他建議。其他發展計有：</p>
<p>（一）衆院銀行委會召前物價管理局長　德，討論物價工資及配售控制。（二）參院銀行委會召聯邦儲備局之伊克爾斯，討論限制銀行資本之方法。（三）參院外委會召開會議，討論杜魯門提請參院批准之國際小麥協定。（四）共和黨衆議員計劃於廿九日午後集會，討論廿六晚共和黨領袖所發表之政策宣言，其內容拒絕大多數杜魯門所提之建議。衆院領袖表示，彼等將靜待參院拖拉及銀行委員會之結果。</p>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓廿八日電〕美參院共和黨政策委員會主席塔虎股今日發表廣播演說稱，杜魯門總統之召集國會，僅係一種「政治手段」。總統並不欲在大選前减低物價，杜魯門擬將物價高漲情形歸咎於共和黨之企圖爲「奸雄之行爲」。渠控指民主黨本身應負此責，原因在於彼等化錢之計劃。塔氏辯稱，共和黨控制之國會應立即休會，但渠又稱，共和黨議員自將留於會議內約達兩週之久，以討論杜魯門所提十八項計劃中可視爲右緊要性質之部份。塔虎脫談稱，「總統並不缺乏减低物價之權力，事實上渠並不欲減低物價，尤其在大選之前。渠需要希望農產品價格高漲之農人的選票，渠需要希望工資增加之工人的選票。」</p>
<h3>義總工會分裂</h3>

<h3>日盟國人員專車　在吳港以南出軌</h3>
<p>可能爲日工人製造之陰謀</p>
<p>〔中央社東京廿九日電〕盟國人員專車，今晨四時五十分，在前日本海軍基地吳港以南軌出，此可能爲日人首度反抗佔領軍之陰謀，當塲盟國人員幸無死傷。中央社記者今晨特以此事走訪盟總諸官員，彼等謂此可能爲日鐵路工人隊麥帥命令日政府禁止罷工一事，深感憤激，因而出此，惟迄未獲得證據，足資佐證上述嫌疑。又日本客車今晨五時三十分，亦在此間北部出軌，無死傷，出動原因，亦不悉。</p>
<h3>麥帥禁止公務員罷工令日各界反對激烈　勞工界認為違背新憲法</h3>
<p>〔合衆社東京廿九日電〕日本若干國立大學及全國中小學校敎師，繼續罷工，公開抗議麥帥致處田首相之「禁止罷工」函件。敎育部次長有水稱：如內閣不發佑臨時禁止罷工令或完成永久禁止罷工立法。渠無法阻止在蔓延中之罷工。</p>
<p>渠並希望即使在敎師被禁止不得罷工後，政府仍將與彼等繼續工資談判，因敎師待遇之過低，乃一　所公認者。一般講來，日木勞工正採取與內閣相反之態度，不承認麥帥函件爲一種指令，似內閣所解釋者，然在禁止罷工立法未完成前，公務員仍可自由罷工，勞工領袖更指責麥帥函件遠反盟總贊譽之新憲法。蓋憲法第廿八條即明白規定：「勞工組織談判及集體行動之權，應予保護。</p>
<h3>萊茵河畔化學工廠發生大爆炸慘劇　燬屋十八幢死傷達二千餘人</h3>

<h3>蘇聯在港拋售黃金</h3>
<p>〔合衆社香港廿八日電〕遠東經濟評論報廿八日載稱，蘇聯拋售其黃金生產，可能使世界黃金市塲陷入窘態，而引起美財部，黃金生產者以及投資者「極大憂慮」。印有明顯蘇聯記號之蘇聯金塊，在市塲中出現。最近有一批蘇聯金塊自荷京遝抵此間，此項金塊係掮客在荷京公開市塲中　進者。</p>
<h3>一個蘇退伍軍官中述的史達林作戰計劃（上）</h3>
<p>— 本報編輯室譯</p>
<p>（蹕者按：此文原載美國雜誌文摘七月號，作者却柏烈氏，係一最近退伍之蘇聯軍官，現寄寓巴黎。）</p>
<p>蘇聯早於美國之前承認：兩國間之冷戰已達高峯，繼之而起者將爲不折不扣之軍事戰爭·捷克之政變即爲共產黨之一項步驟。其他如加速希臘及中國之內戰亦爲其迫向最後攤牌之策略。</p>
<p>作爲一蘇聯軍官，我有機會去獲悉蘇聯作戰計劃之內容。此項作戰計劃，與世界其他各强之純防守性作戰計劃不同，而係一如何採取主動攻擊之作戰計劃。</p>
<p>無可否記，蘇聯幷不需要戰爭。但克林姆宮之人物卻認爲不管蘇聯是否需要戰爭，雙方衝突最後終將來臨。因爲有此信念，故其亟需準備如何首先發動出擊之計劃。</p>
<p>蘇聯參謀部相信，未來之三次大戰將分成三個主要階段進行。</p>
<p>第一階段</p>
<p>首先迅速佔領西歐。此舉蘇聯以爲：挾其雄厚之兵力，在三星期以内即可完成之。</p>
<p>第二階段</p>
<p>於此一階段內蘇聯需同時完成下列各項步驟。第一，佔領西歐後，即行攻擊伊比里亞半島，渡地中海而南，楔入北非。同時幷攻擊伊朗，伊拉克，叙利亞，把箭頭指向蘇彝士遝河。而後，再發動攻擊弗朗哥之戰爭。</p>
<p>西班牙之戰事，蘇軍在西洗亡共和政府及西國內反弗朗哥人們之支持下。甚易取得勝利。於解決弗朗哥以後，蘇軍即將進攻法屬北非之大西洋重要港日—達卡。一日佔領該地，則可直接威脅整個南美矣。</p>
<p>與外界揣測相反，蘇聯並無以攻擊土耳其作進攻蘇　士跳板之意之圖。蘇軍將以土耳其作爲次一目標而繞道前進，奪取直布羅陀，消除地中海之軍事作用。</p>
<p>據估計：有三個月之時間，蘇聯即可完成上述之任務。</p>
<p>於達到上述各項步驟以後，而在第三階段尙未到來以前，蘇聯將儘力保衛歐洲兩翼以防止來自英國之攻擊。此一防守計劃需一百師之兵力達成之。而一百師兵力中之半數，將由捷·保·南三國分別負擔。</p>
<p>第三階段</p>
<p>亦即整個戰爭中之最後一個階段。蘇軍將直接進攻遠東，決定性之戰爭可能於中國境內開始。蘇聯將日中國共軍獲得三百師兵力之補充。據蘇方估計。整個亞洲戰事，可於兩年內結束。</p>
<p>征服中國</p>
<p>征服中國以後，蘇聯向美國提出和平建議，劃分兩大勢力範圍。歐洲（英國除外），近東中東·北菲·中國等地區屬於蘇聯·印度·越南·印尼·南美·英國及其殖民地則屬於美國。</p>
<p>原子炸彈</p>
<p>關於原子彈方面，蘇聯將以分散軍事物資之方法，來抵制原子彈轟炸。同時，蘇聯科學家巳充分獲悉如何製造原子彈之方法，但他們却缺少生產原子彈之工業設備。不過，他們計劃中之三大原子彈工廠之一，已在建設中，此種原子彈工廠皆設立於西伯利亞之中部，可能於今年年底以前造出原子彈。</p>

<p>一見傾心，在船早夕相處，即發生曖昩。王明權目覩杜劉行爲不當，乃對杜女加以勸吿。杜女非但不受勸吿，反言願以身許劉，一切犧牲均所不惜，王聞之大怒，即揚言抵申後，將以始末吿其親戚，並謂將向警憲海關，檢舉該女所帶之人參十斤，衣料多件。杜女被恐嚇後，又在船大鬧，不免爲同船者恥笑，因之深受刺激，又聞該女三年前結婚祇年餘，丈夫即死，兼之營口陷落，全家遭匪俘擄，家產被刦，各種刺激議集心頭，頓萌厭世之心。該輪於廿六日晨離大沾駛氾，至廿七日晨，杜女</p>

<p>不翼而飛該組亦在調查中，後記者至杜律師處探詢對該衆意見，據杜律師稱，對堂妹之案，一時無言可答。因彼等南來之事，事前並無所聞，離家鄕十餘年，音訊不通，對三嫌疑犯之處置，尙在研究中，祗須能對叔父（指杜女之父）有一交代云。</p>
<h3>善管會標售漁輪　漁業決拒絕標購　招待記者指責辦法不合理</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕最近善後事業保管委員會登報標售漁業善後物資機動漁輪二十艘，本市民營漁業界以該項船隻，名爲漁輪，實係不能出漁之船，且所定契約辦法頗有不合理之處，拒絕標購。昨日下午漁輪商業同業公會招待記者，呼籲主持公道。據理事長胡時淵等稱：（一）該二十艘船隻原係美軍在太平洋戰爭時向澳洲訂造，作鳥嶼間交通工具者，並未經過改建工程。船上無漁撈工具，船船無冰魚設備，引擎速度太快，齒輪不適於拖網，載重量過小，不合漁撈經濟。（二）契約規定以英文爲準，有失國體。其中將政府交予保管之船隻指爲政府轉讓所有權，而付款辦法以美金折合國幣，除先付二十份之一外，再付期票十九紙，票面國幣，但負隨時外匯調整差額之保證，須指定銀行保付，期限五年。此種辦法爲任何銀行所不能辦到。民營漁業認爲善委會如此標售，簡直毫無誠意，故要求會同漁業公司代表，組織技術委員會鑑定漁船性能，再作公開合理之研究分配，以息紛爭。</p>

<h3>五盜奪車駛蘇　沿途攔劫行人　各地軍警四出兜捕　黎里鎮上勾留落綱</h3>
<p>〔本報蘇州廿九日電〕上海祥生公司出差汽車一輛，車號〇三：三二六四，於今晨零時許，在滬爲匪刦持，循蘇滬公路駛來蘇州。匪共五人，二穿軍服，三穿便衣，持有六寸白朗林手槍一支。車行未幾，即將祥生駕駛員趕下，由匪徒自行駕駛。四時四十分，車抵蘇州盤門郊外，遇菜販趕市，竟即下軍攔刻，所獲無幾。匪車乃折向蘇嘉公路，沿路肆意攔刻行人，經報警有案者，計吳江縣屬茅山堂有小販被刦金戒三只，耳環三付，現鈔七百卅萬元，平望八尺間向龍橋有布商被刦八千萬元等。當時沿路各地軍警機關據報，急電話各處兜捕。不料匪車駛經盛澤祝江橋地方時，適與蘇嘉長途汽車交車，因路面狹窄，匪車駕駛不愼，竟傾覆田間，然並無損傷。匪倉皇爬出後，即棄車携贓向盛澤西南方逸去。迨附近軍警得報趕到，已無法追緝。至下午三時許，有吳江縣府政警邵錦堂，因公至黎里鎭工作，於小飯店發現有食客五人，形跡詭秘，疑係匪徒，乃報由當地警所逮捕，搜出槍械贓物，一鞠即服。五匪姓名爲宣立民，傅惠民，孫浩富，姚和尙，金榮昌，均承認攔路行刦不諱。且據供稱：原擬再駕車經嘉興赴杭州，沿路搶刻，冀多收獲，因覆車而吿作罷云。</p>
<p>按該出差汽車爲膠州路愚園路口祥生汽車公司第七分站者，前夜應客電召，由司機陳渭浦駕駛前往，至大西路靜安寺路口時，有五男子招呼上車，囑駛往北新涇，中途五客突出槍恫嚇，迫令司機下車，並將其手足用繩捆綁，曳往田野中後，即自駕車向西逸去。事後陳渭浦拼力將繩掙脫，投報該管警分局陳家橋派出所請求追緝。</p>

<h3>軍火資匪　三要犯解京　區公所幹事牽綫　銀行兩職員受惑</h3>
<p>本市治安機關，頃破獲一軍火資匪案，要犯趙錫金等三名，均已拘獲，緣該機關最近迭獲密報，謂有浦東南匯江蘇農民銀行會計主任趙錫金，及該行職員夏炎等，以銀行職員身份爲掩護，暗中勾結共匪，以軍火資匪，當經該機關派員密查屬實，乃於目前派遺幹員赴浦東，當將兩犯拘捕，復根據口供，得悉彼等與共匪勾結，係由區公所幹事姚浩然從中牽綫。該機關據供當即派員按址將姚逮捕，該犯等所犯罪行，係時以自衛隊需購槍械名義，迭次購運軍火赴匪區，爲數甚鉅。現當局因該案情節重大，牽連頗廣，除將三要犯於昨晨移送南京訊辦外，刻正繼續偵查中。</p>
<h3>小學徒裝神作鬼　國藥號誠惶誠恐　三次怪火妄稱藥神大盜　留條四紙核對筆跡破案</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕西藏南路七十六號葉樹德堂國藥號，主人爲本市國大代表中醫丁濟萬，聘裘寗生爲經理，內有職員學生共三十餘人。最近一月內，該號接通發生火警三四次，疑神疑鬼警惺異當。</p>
<p>第一次係在六月廿二日夜間十時零五分，發覺起火後，燒至午夜零時十分始行救熄。棧房二層樓前樓全部焚燬，三層樓門窗亦被延燒，幸有天橋相隔，店堂尙未波及，經理寢室在棧之裏邊，當時越火逃命，受傷甚劇。所怪者起火共有三處，其餘兩處，係在店堂樓上，後經店夥撲滅，得未成災。</p>
<p>第二次係在七月十日下午九時，店堂樓上二樓貨房，突復起火。平日門窗加鎖，藥材之內，且無易燃物品，原因完全不明。幸有消防隊及時趕到，損失輕微。</p>
<p>第三次相隔僅數日，又在細料間內擱板上發現已燃之白錫包香烟一支，火柴一匣，及散置之火柴梗與蔴莖一堆，默又備以引火，使其焚燒，幸戒備已嚴，發覺尙早，亦經撲滅。但遍查店中，向無吸此白錫包之紙烟者，憂疑益甚。</p>
<p>全店騷動　日夜巡邏</p>
<p>嗣後，店主經理店夥學徒等，惶恐紛擾，全號騷然，日間有專買監視者，夜間分班巡邏者，人人情緒，均入恐怖狀態中·復在號中陸續發現怪字條，語調似神似鬼，用意旣若警吿，又若恐嚇。第一紙略謂「速即走出經理學徒三人及黃姓張姓二職員，否則將人焚斃，店堂化灰」。</p>
<p>第二級略謂「吾乃藥神是也，氣數已盡，人還不走，膽子眞大，求吾姐姐何用，現在原諒你走出同事兩個小學生，如不走，是不客氣，烈火便生，再等三天，特字通知」。</p>
<p>門窗未啓　突來字條</p>
<p>第三紙略問。第四紙發現在賬房馬惠人之　室內，更覺離奇。賬房澈夜巡查，至晨間五時始宸，曾檢點桌上簿册雜物，並無真狀，迨八時醒來，門窗關閉如故，而　册底下則竟發現第四紙之怪紙條，內稱：「吾非藥神，吾乃未出名之大盜也，因先父與店主有仇，前來報復，限水土之日，人都走出，否則活活燒死，店堂化灰，吾乃大盜花馬忠是也」。</p>
<p>研究筆跡　尋出綫索</p>
<p>市警局張副局長及該管嵩山分局長陳志靑對此案甚爲重視，迭飭司法股長陳開洲加緊偵緝，限期破案。陳股長受命之下，日夜偵查，卒於本月廿六日下千四時，帶同股員談據林，警員談特聲等將此自稱「大盜」者拘獲，帶局一鞫而服。</p>
<p>緣陳股長全在字跡上　恨，該怪字條四紙，字跡均係故意做作，似翰似篆，莫可辦　，但於字之結構間，仍保留原狀。例如散字左下邊均作「日」字，而神字之「不」旁均錯作「衣」字。店字上邊應作「廣」，亦誤作「廣」。在店員卅餘人中個個核對筆跡，並盡量搜羅日常遺留之字跡，確能合乎類此之特徵者，僅學徒沈增華一人。</p>
<p>意圖他去　竞生妄念</p>
<p>沈增華十八歲，寗波人，父死母嫁，貧困無依，少時曾　書三五年，輾轉托人薦入葉樹德堂學業。據供：三次放火，四次留條，確屬渠一人所爲，別無同黨。原因爲工作太苦，待遇欠佳，更因其他學從兩人欺凌過甚，意圓輟業他就，深恐原保薦人責備，不肯再尋別業，故欲恐嚇店主便全店解散，或將學徒辭歇，彼可達成目的，而不認過錯。至於放火，並無燒燬惡意，每次放後，均爲彼最初呌喊，並首先取水灌救。第一次經理險被燒斃，幸由彼喊呌，得能逃生云云。</p>
<p>警局據供核證，對於沈增華之放火罪行，認為已無疑養，但對犯罪之原因，究係宿怨，抑或僅係如此簡單，尙在研究中。</p>
<h3>路局鄭重遴選　未來車務人員</h3>
<p>兩路局最近開辦車務人員訓練班，已於本月十四日公開招考，資格限高中畢業，錄取二百名。投考者達二千餘人。該局陳局長爲遴取眞才起見，指派局中處憂級職員，於每日上午十一時至十二時公餘之暇，在會報室評閱考卷，並請江蘇監察使派員到局監視，以免發生「請託」等私弊。每日閱卷時各處長停止會客，亦不准將考卷携出會報室。至十二時後，所有巳閱朱閱考卷均由監察員火漆簽封，各處長諧喩此小一時爲有期徒刑，認係一大苦事。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕西藏南路南陽橋恒安坊卅五號享子間，庽有舞女趙小毛，日與舞客等，在房內裸體伴舞，淫業鼎盛。昨日午後一時三十分許，適被二房東孟阿四瞥見，以有傷風化，向其申斥，竟因之發生口角。事後趙女反惱羞成怒，外出邀集「薄刀黨」十餘人到來，時孟適在同里五十號王姓家閒談，由趙氏率領暴徒趕至王宅，用棍將孟遍體亂擊，傷勢殊重，尙有王姓之　朱氏，亦遭毆傷面手部。此外並搗毀王宅之陳酒兩甏及其他傢具等物。更有白曎嘰西裝一套，內藏五十型金套派克筆一支，瑞士掛錶一只，均不翼而飛。迨警察聞訊趕到，暴徒日一哄而散，乃將男女受傷兩人，召救護車監　醫院療治，一面將主犯趙小毛拘獲，帶入蓬萊警分局南陽橋派出所依法究辦。</p>

<p>〔本報莫干山廿七日快訊〕在浙江的西邊，作爲避暑勝地的莫干山，竹林茂密環境淸幽，經年經中外人士的經營，已有了規模，戰時受到影騙，鴃後浙省特別設局來管理它，以冀使它獲得中外人士的傾倒·今年，我們巳經爲文報道莫干山在欣欣向榮，在興建的途中。正在這個時候，蔣總統忽然蒞山避暑，這實在使莫干山在興建途中增加了無比的鼓。</p>
<p>蔣總統是在廿六日決定來莫干山的，兩個月前，在莫干山就有傳說，各方面都在佈置準備，但僅是傳說而巳，不意廿六日晨，蔣夫人由滬飛京，廿六日午總統還接見了白祟禧總司令，下午他決定和夫人飛杭州，轉往莫干山。</p>
<p>全不休息直抵庚村</p>
<p>事前，蔣經國和兪濟時到了杭州，忙着佈置總統的官邸，一面也通知了莫干山管理局局長王正誼，要他立即準備，王是在廿六日中午時候才知道的，趕上山來準備。蔣經國在杭的時間，有很多朋友問他：「老先生要來了嗎？一他僅是笑了一笑。</p>
<p>俞局長　心着消息露布，反使總統不能淸靜的休息，新聞記者羣在當日一時許，巳獲得了綫索，下午各處電話紛忙，各有關機關也守口如瓶，下午五時多，總統確已來杭州了，他們預備好的官邸也沒有去休息，就此直抵莫干山脚下庾村，到達時已是下午七時半了。</p>
<p>官邸四周松林清幽</p>
<p>管理局把頸備的轎子，請總統夫婦登山，那轎子是仿照廬山造的，用四人抬，轎夫據說亦曾在事前加以訓練過。</p>
<p>總統住的地方，是武林村五五〇號，俗名屋脊頭五五〇號，那裏地勢很高，房屋也不繁雜僅有三數幢而已。總統的官邸是上海浙江興業銀行董事陳永靑的，屋內有衛生設備，有客室，有傭人住的地方，四週植以整齊的松林，淸靜幽閒，眞是：「靜坐却嫌流水鬧，閒眺翻怪白雲忙。</p>
<p>總統夫婦在下午八時許，到達山上，杭州市市長周象賢和蔣經國陪侍上山的，因爲時間太晚，所以連周市長應用的器具如吸烟，打火機等，也沒有來得及送到山上來。</p>
<p>山中兩日接見多人</p>
<p>在山上已經兩天了，除了接見浙主席陳儀，綏靖主任湯恩伯和浙省參議會議長張强外，其餘的時間都在休息之中。他伉儷有時在官邸的附近漫步，有時走下山來，在山路上閒散，有時去劍池看看干將莫　練劍的地方。有時靜坐官邸一回，狀頗悠閒自得</p>
<p>在「諸澗好花如靜女，數峯奇石似飛仙一的莫干山上，雖然這山的氣魄規模要較　山小，但是她有她小巧玲瓏的好處。總統到莫干山來，已是第三趙，第一趨是黃郛安葬的時候，第二趟也是來遊山的，只到塔山公園的門口，就折回了，但這兩趙都是當天回去的，沒有像這一趟住下來了</p>
<p>電燈被搬蠟燭代光</p>
<p>山上原來有電燈的，經對日抗戰後機器被搬走了，迄今沒有裝起來，所以在官邸中裝的是汽油燈，總統嫌略有煤氣，改用蠟燭代光。山上遠近中外居民，天天在各處名勝處迎候，無非想瞻仰風采。廿七傍晚，他在山邊的馬路上散步，爲記者們發現了，他頻頻地招呼我們，還問我們：「來玩的嗎？玩得好嗎？</p>
<p>山上物價與杭州相若，不過庾村比較高得多，庾村吃一客蛋炒飯，就要八十萬元，宿一個人，（沒有房間眞是權宿，）要一百五十萬元，雇一輛車子，要百萬元。</p>
<p>山上遊客外籍居多</p>
<p>山上外國人最多，女的大半都是短褲帶着奶罩，男的多半是短褲，有領的汗衫，他們見了總統，都立正行敬禮。</p>
<p>山上唯一的金融機構，是浙江商業儲蓄銀行，由麗孝文先生負責，人頂和氣，郵電機構也很健全，由吳南士等四位先生主辦。總統上山後，他們四人眞是忙得不可開交，但是由於他們四位工作的努力，終於電訊暢達無阻。</p>
<p>據有關方面傳出：總統在山上不擬多事逗留，但是看見電信設備的絡繹不斷裝置，看見警衛力量的在逐漸加强，到底會不會住久，這是新聞紀者追尋的課題。</p>
<p>滿山蟬虫鼓着牠的翅膀，努力的在呌「知了，知了，知了，」還夾着溪澗間的琤琮洗水，正交織着一曲美麗的音樂。</p>

<h3>租約期滿拒不遷讓　房屋糾紛對簿公庭</h3>
<p>吳庭問　鄙人在上海有房屋一幢，租與某姓住居，今年正月期滿，房客拒不遷讓，終至對簿公庭，經判決被吿於若干月內遷讓，並准予假執行，茲有疑問數點，請予解答爲感：（一）在遷讓期間之房租，是否可照舊收取，可否於執行時一併淸算？（二）旣判決假執行，然迄今猶未執行，能否再向法院聲請，因無力提供殷實舖保，應如何辦理？（三）該屋內之晒台損壞，被吿不願修理，以致塌毀，被吿有否賠償之責任？蓋租契內載明「承租人應將房屋保持善狀，不得使他人或自己損毀等語」。</p>
<p>〔姜　藩律師答〕（一）遷讓期內之租金，當然可以牧取。判決主文內如無給付租金之記載，不能請求一併執行。（二）判決主文內載明提供祖保後准予假執行者，應照主文辦理。（三）依法可以請求承租人賠償或回復原狀。</p>

<h3>開放自備外匯新法實施後限額制仍然保持　實施細則正由行政了守核定中</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕輸管會主委霍寳樹，於昨日午後四時，假中國銀行四樓同時招待進出口商及新聞界，就僑資及國人在外資金投資國內生產事業辦法，詳作補充說明，並對各項問題，作扼要答覆。霍主委報吿全文如次：</p>
<p>『行政院在本月廿一日第八次會議中通過僑資及國人在外資金投資國內生產事業辦法，業經在報紙公佈，其精神所在，吾人可略加說明：</p>
<p>（一）補充生產工具：十年以來，國內生產事業疊遭破壞，亟需補充恢復。戰爭期內，國內廠家多有在國外訂購機器者，此時亟需進口，而國外僑胞其希望投資國內生產事業者，自應予以便利。</p>
<p>（二）補充生產原料：此辦法中，第八條中規定准許僑資帶回國內所需之主要原料，原料項目請見附表，此類原料，皆爲國內所缺乏，且爲美援所未曾包括，而華僑居留地則爲主要生產地者。</p>
<p>（三）配合國內工業需要；目前公佈之附表中，所列原料，皆爲國內異常缺乏者，將來公佈時，仍將與工業需要相配合。凡國內已敷應用者，不予進口，缺乏者即予補充。</p>
<p>（四）限額制仍然保持：本辦法日的，在於補充工業原料之不足，因國內原料異常缺乏，故限額制仍然保特。</p>
<p>（五）手續簡單：此項辦法，對申請人除去加備計劃及營業估計書外，幷未增加任何手續且申請人如本身不能辦理進口，亦可委託合格之進口商代爲辦理。</p>
<p>（六）妥愼審查：此項申請書，將先由各主管部會限時審查。主管部曾審查後，交來本會，本會將專設小組委員妥愼審查。但審查時間，必須迅速，務使申請人在最短期內，對於其申請結果，獲取答復。惟申請人務須注意，在送請各部會審查時，必須將各項證明文件，依照規定，準備齊全，以免公文往返，躭延審查時間。</p>
<p>附表：准予申請輸入之原料，以下列各項爲限：米，麥，麵粉，棉花，羊毛，苧蔴及蔴袋，蔴草，生橡膠及汽車胎，木材及枕木，肥料，汽油，柴油，滑物油，煤，焦炭，紙及紙漿，椰子汕，特效藥品原料。</p>
<h3>補充說明</h3>
<p>霍氏報吿畢，陳雋人，方鹓先，沈奏庭，黃慶華各處長對各項技術問題，續作補充說明如下，</p>
<p>（一）國人在外資金所購運回國之原料設備，只能自用而不能出售，此爲與僑資不同之處。將來輸管曾擬會同有關機關合組考核會，監督國人在外資金歸國後之使用情形，並防止原料等之非法出　。</p>
<p>（二）本辦法所允許進口之一一十餘種原料物資，均爲性貿單純，國內缺乏，而爲華僑在當地所易於採購者；五金及化學品等物資，雖爲國內所需要，但因其性質複雜，暫時不在准許人口之口之列。</p>
<p>（三）將來僑資申請購運物資之手續，力求其簡易迅速，主管部會之審查時間，不出兩月，輸管會將專設小組辦理此事。一經審核完畢，即呵頒發許可證。</p>
<p>（四）過去目備外匯是否應予開放，曾有正反兩種理論，目前所實施之辦法，使工廠能獲得所需之原料，而同時能避免因開放而可能發生之弊端。</p>
<h3>扼要答覆</h3>
<p>各處主管說明後，進出口業及新聞記者紛紛提出詢問，當由霍主委親自作扼要答覆，茲誌其車要者如下：</p>
<p>（一）目前之辦法可作爲一個試驗，成績良好時，可慢慢放鬆，以至完全開放；因政府對外匯開放後之市面有顧慮，故現辦法不能不有相當限制。</p>
<p>（二）外商原已在華設廠者，可按本辦法一體辦理，至於新到之外國資本，當另案辦理。</p>
<p>（三）港澳之資金是否能作爲僑資一點，政院並無明確指示，而內地與港澳往來不需護照，亦不能視其爲外國領土，故港澳資金之處理，需與工業貿易兩界研究後再行規定。霍氏答覆後，張耀章，洪念祖就進口及工業界之立塲，提出意見，霍氏允與兩業人士研究考慮，招待會至六時始結束</p>
<h3>紗商同業請紗會改善拋紗辦法</h3>
<p>領取棧單困難紗商損失甚鉅</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕本市紗商業同業公會，迭據各會員報吿，向中國紡織建設公司標得之棉紗，於繳款後領取棧單，常延遲至六七日之久，前經由會函請該公司設法改善有案，最近更屬變本加厲，如本月十三日所標得之紗，截至本日止，尙未取得棧單，相請竟至半月之久。聞紗商標購棉紗，大都用以運銷外埠，及供應複製手工業等實用所需，收取棧單遲緩，則躭誤船期，損失利息至鉅，故該會於昨日，再函紡建公司要求迅予改善。</p>
<p>又據紗業公會訊：該會會員，於本年三月間向紡建公司標得棉紗，至各廠提貨時，必需補墊統稅，數月以來，累積至鉅，迭經由會具呈紗管會，請求發還，雖蒙允准，囑令至原廠領回，迄今仍未領到。</p>
<p>再本年六月十九日起卅日止，紗管會拋紗千餘件，本會各會員向紡建公司所購廿支天女棉紗計七百餘件，墊稅達二百餘億，現正由該公司轉呈紗管會及中央銀行發還中，各紗商則亟盼早日解決，以免多所損失。</p>
<p>再聞此次央行曁紡建公司之遲發棧單，與抽緊銀根一事有關，惟紗商方面則以爲因此遭受損害，呼籲無門，不啻池魚之殃云。</p>
<p>紗市略好</p>
<p>昨日棉紗市况，因銀根步鬆，客路津粵等帮辦胃仍健，本市複製業亦有吸納，人心均呈看俏。</p>
<p>四十二支藍鳳細紗，初開即跳升一億元，中途廠商以月底將屆，頸備發給工資，安排頭寸，在市脫貨求現，因此行情曾見回小七八千萬，最後明日出以十八億八千萬結鐵，比上日軋升八千萬元，現出亦好五千萬元。</p>
<p>廿一支雙馬紗，近收本衝有進，現出軋好五千萬，隔日出貨計四千萬元，其餘各支粗細紗，亦均帶挺四千萬至七八千萬元不一，全日成交祗五十八件。</p>
<p>棉布平定</p>
<p>昨日棉布市况，因銀根依然寬鬆，更有北路現紗頻向市塲活動，十二磅龍頭細布，晨開即見上竄六十萬元。詎開後利賣空氣復傳，人心吿虛，吐售紛起，行情一度盤小。旋有粵漢及北帮採購甚勁，檯面帮亦乘機拉提，人心轉挺，一路上揚至五千四百萬元高峰。迨近收時，見高踟蹰，聞紗市平庸，且客幫止進有出，散戶紛紛了售，市盤乃回低至五千三百六十萬結束，較上日再漲四百二十萬元。惟最後聞紡建公司有大量供售，塲外降至五千二百萬元有售出，比上日反見疲軟。其他各檔細布及曎嘰等市亦挺秀，全日成交一千八百八十疋。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕紗管會新聞組息，紗管會待命撤銷後之職員遺散辦法，將遵照中央規定辦理，職員亦從宋提出任何要求，外傳有所要求，幷非事實云。</p>
<h3>挺勢未能持久　華股市況平庸</h3>
<p>華股昨游資乘開放外匯之前，移地活動雖漲而不能持久，勤興景綸及兩地產股均曾漲停，並無刺激，大部份呈趦趕狀態。</p>
<p>晨初平庸，各股咸呈參差，永紗則以一一四五〇元平盤登塲，雖由一六九號一三四號等進至一一九二〇元高價，但不久即由一〇二號一四三號等賣到一一一五七〇元，勸興景綸聯地永業漲達限度，一六九號一七六號等進胃尙殷升爲一一七三〇元，實貨不過爾爾，一六四號八九號等了結，近午迫降至一一二〇〇元，一〇三號一三七號等來買，九九號一五四號補轉，午收爲一一二八〇元。較前收除永業聯地漲停，勤興景綸漲停後有回，內衣跌停後有回，軋小一成。新光上泥永公麗安中絲商務閘北新華各跌半成外，餘均升降俱微。</p>
<p>後市永紗雖有增資之傳說，開高少許爲一一七〇〇元，二六號賣至一一五五〇元，一二九號七六號等尙進，業外頗有漲上，升爲一一八〇〇元。二二八號五一號等脫售，退爲一一四八〇〇元。國行差出，一三一號九五號等進至一一七〇〇元，六一號一一六號等脫售，收市一一五七〇元。較晨收計聯地仍屬漲停，美亞內衣景綸永公中法漲半成，閘北商務火柴麗安統益尙平，中泥小挫，餘均微升。塲外各未上市股票，以公用文化銀行等股較怯，餘尙平穩。</p>

<h3>私校下期收費　李教局長談話主以實物爲準</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕下學期本市私立中小學收費標準問題，各方傳說紛紜。敎局長李熙謀與記者談：軍慶杭州等地收費皆以實物作標準，爲求一勞永逸，梁個人主張本市私立中小　收費，亦以實物　標準。渠認爲如欲學校辦好，收費不應限制。私校經濟應由校董會負責，現一般私校所以經費不敷，皆因校董多徒負虛名。渠認為下期收費標　高初中以食米二石，小學以食米一石咬爲合理。如依此標準收費，祇要校長能絕對做到經濟公開並顧及教職員福利，相信學校開支可以維持。現教局已令私立中小學校首先會商擬定一標準，再由敎局呈奉吳市長核定。</p>
<p>蔣紀周談話</p>
<p>〔又訊〕據本市私立中小學聯合會負責人蔣紀周吿記者；下學期私立中小收費標準，該會需在八月中旬開會決定。上學期學雜費標準高中最高額爲四百八十萬，初中最高額爲三百八十四萬，小學最高額爲二百四十萬，當時米價每石爲一百八十萬。本學期商討收費標準時，亦將參酌米價。</p>
<p>進修費停徵</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕市教局李局長昨稱：下學期市校進修費不擬征收。修建費則因市府補助不多，仍將酌予征收。敎局前計劃下學期增添國敎班二百班，已經參議會通過，但市府是否有款撥下尙成問題。</p>
<p>李局長稱：敎局現正努力於下學期本市淸寒獎學金之籌募工作。籌募方式擬由個人或團體視能力認定一名或數名清寒學生之獎金。以往獎金籌集後，由統一審核委員會集中支配撥付學校，捐款者與領受者不發生關係，上學期領受獎金之大中小學生約共一萬各。今後擬使捐款者與領受者直接接觸，由領受者自至捐款者處領款。待等學期終了時，並由校方將受獎學生之成績單寄予捐款者考合。</p>

<p>自由談</p>
<h3>從鑲牙齒看豐子愷先生</h3>
<p>— 許欽文</p>
<p>雖然同寓西子湖畔，因爲忙碌，我和豐子愷先生很少見面的時候；只是鄭棣君來訪時，常從他的口中聰到點豐先生的消息。</p>
<p>「這兩天豐先生又牙齒痛，所以沒有作畫。」</p>
<p>這是屢次聽到的話了。以前豐先生抱「三不」主義；就是不敎書，不講演，不宴會。固然因爲忙於作畫；不敎書，一半也是常常牙齒痛，不便多說話的緣故　講演，同樣因爲牙齒要痛，不便多說話，不宴會，因爲素食，不吃魚蝦肉類以外，也是牙齒壞了，咀嚼不便的緣故。所以三不主義，爲的只是一個原因，就是牙齒壞，咀嚼說話都不便。這使我常常感慨着想：要是牙齒不壞，一定可以多產生些大家所愛好的沒書。記得元慶同我這樣說過，豐先生的敎授法，好在使人不覺得他是個敎員；好像在同親戚朋友的談話中，得到了許多很好的指示。這樣優良的藝術敎育家，爲着牙齒不好，居然抱了三不主義，不敎書，也不講演了；這是何等可借的事</p>
<p>去年暑假，我由易昭雪醫師　去四個臼齒的根，　好了兩旁　排的齒，咀嚼便當，疾病减少了。易醫師手術精而收費低，人又和氣。我很感激，寫了「托下巴」以紀其事，又託豐先生寫了最後一句「每飯不忘」以作紀念。妻的一顆痛牙，是牙脚轉了　的，由易醫師分作兩次拔出。這一節豐先生也知道。言談之間，豐先生注意我們拔牙的事，似乎頗感興趣。但我知道他對於齡壞了的牙　，即使動搖得很厲害了，還是不育用人工拔下，總是忍耐着等候自然落脫的。死了母親就不再剃　　的藝術家的性情，我相富了解，以爲並不足怪。但我憑着友誼的熱誠，終於試試勸他拔去壤的牙根了。由我們夫婦證明了易醫師的拔牙並不感覺到痛，也不多見血，又談到有否危險的問題。</p>
<p>「拔牙齒，」我說，「所怕的是血友病；拔牙齒本來沒有什麽危險，患着血友病的人一出血就不容易止住，這才麻煩。所以只要第一顆拔下來不發生問題，以後再拔就不怕什麼了。其次是心臟病；因爲注射麻藥的時候要加點止血液，患心臟病的人會氣急起來，耐不住。」</p>
<p>這些話是從易醫師裏聽來的，我只是一開了一偏留聲機。</p>
<p>「心臟病我沒有，血友病大概也不至於。」豐先生這樣說，顯然，對於拔牙，已經動心了。我把這意思吿訴易醫師的時候，要認爲一件難事的。檢查的結果，要拔去十七個牙根，才可以滿口鑲上義齒。我覺得這件事情很困難，屢次晴示易醫師，對於藝術者的豐先生，慣於任其自然，不好隨便勉强。可是，出於意料的，一天，易醫師來看我，說是豐先生己經拔了兩次牙根，經過良好。他說，一豐先生來拔牙齒以前，是先寫給我一封信的，約定那一天幾點鐘一定來。等到實行來拔的一天，他問我，「你知道我爲什麽要先寫封信給你的原因麽？」我早吿訴他明白，　星期日的下午，我不出門，　便什麽時候來都可以：實在沒有預先通知的必要。但他說明，寫這封信的目的，並非眞爲通知我，原是爲着約束他自己。當他忽然下了拔去牙根的決心時，恐怕以後猶嚴缺少勇氣實行，故意趕快寫出這封信，使得變爲一種信約，到了時日不得不實踐。因此我知道，豐先生對於拔牙根實在怕些些；但他重信用，是守約的，所以按照時間，終於實行來拔了！</p>
<p>聽得很感動；乘便去看豐先生時，已經拔完了牙根。說是有時連日的拔，有時一次連拔兩三個，是縮短了預定的時間的。「拔落了最後的一個牙根，才覺得兩肩輕鬆！」豐先生得意的說。</p>
<p>口無一齒，恐怕吃食不便，我便探間他怎樣；他說，一反正不吃堅硬的東西。我飯吃得很快，不多　，這習慣還是在讀書的時候養成功的，爲驚爭先去彈鋼琴。</p>
<p>這使我悟着：繪　，音樂，文學和書法樣樣有了特色的豐子愷先生，藝術的精深，並不是偶然的。下了決心，認眞研求，這才能够成功。拔去牙根十七個，只是最近的一例。當初以爲困難，並非全是過慮，只是我以爲豐先生富藝術性，凡事愛任自然，不知道他也是很能掙脫自然而努力求進的。</p>
<p>豐先生又是這樣率眞的，在紀載拔牙齒的文字上，提到我時總在我的姓名下面加上「兄」或「先生」等稱呼；在寫感想的一段，却只「許欽文」三個字。如果也加稱呼，那非人情之常；在暗自想着的時候，對人不會加稱呼。可是一般虛僞的紀載，也會加上許多花樣的。他送易醫師一副對，上聯「技進於神」，下聯一人造勝天　在剛鑲好義齒的時候他對我說，上聯實在是對的，易醫師的技術的確不錯，拔完了牙根，只覺得以前的恐怖完全是多事。可是下聯，還有問題；究竟假的，沒有像自已眞牙齒的便當。」如果長久不便，也是技術的缺憾。我以爲這只是對我說說的；過了幾天，碰到易醫師，提到這意思，可見對他也已照樣表示了。可是過了兩三個月，牙床結實了，經過一番整理的手續以後，也是習慣的了。豐先生又對我表示，下聯也是對的了。隨卽也就從易醫師的口中聽到了這樣的意思。——覺得怎樣，就怎樣表示；對於事理忠實，原是藝術家的本色。從拔牙齒，我愈覺得豐先生是能够保眞而呵敬的了。</p>
<h3>天堂與地獄</h3>
<p>— 吳庸</p>
<p>今日親友相遇，百分之九十九總是以彼此訴苦始，以相對唏噓終，耳際但聞得一片失望怨憤之聲。鄙意却以爲這未始不是一種好的現象。</p>
<p>事實上自然也有對於現狀表示欣慰不勝感奮的人，這些即屬於百分之一的少數分子，此輩或隔岸觀火，或渾水摸魚，或火上加油，總之都是些雲端里的人。此外又有些本是地面上的人，只是一味想與雲端里的人取得聯絡，因此出言吐語，對於現狀無一非嘖嘖稱賞之詞，這些人是尙未斷奶的大孩子，至死不能離奶娘而獨立生存，奶娘偶說今天天氣嫌冷，他便會說：簡直與北極一樣；有人主張發行百萬元大鈔，他會立即讚成發行千萬元一億元大鈔。這些人骨子里無非是些「走江湖」的一洗，始終以一此處不留爺，自有留爺處」爲惟一的處世信條；此輩的是非之心早已泯滅，天良早已喪盡，只以「看風使舵」爲能事；聽其言語，初看好像對當局有利，實則奶盡就立即又是一種論調；最爲誤事最爲不濟的即是此輩。對於這類滿懷樂觀的雲端里的人，或隨聲附和的準雲端里的人，我們實在無法寄予絲毫的希望。</p>
<p>反之，那些口出怨言的人，骨子里却實是最渴望現狀有所改善的人，亦即是寄希望於政府最濃厚的人；其出言之憤激，正足示其對政府期望之熱切。</p>
<p>只是「失望」往往容易轉變爲「絕望」，以致流於消極頹廢。這却未免矯枉過正，恰像與雲端里的人形成了兩個極端，一個在天上，一個在地底，與居在中間的人世脫了節。我們須知地球自凝成到現在，大約已是經過了二十億年以上的時間，而地球上人類的文明史迄今至多僅是四千年。我們須知人類之有釋迦牟尼，迄今還不渦二千四百餘年；人類之有孔子，迄今還不過二千四百九十九年；人類之有耶穌，迄今還不過一千九百四十八年。哥倫布的發現新大陸還只是四百餘年前的事；哥白尼於一五四三年始創「地動設」，而白魯諾及迦琍略只因深信此說，前者被活活燒死，後者被判處甫刑，這在今人看來，自覺好笑，然而實在還只是四百餘年前的事。瓦特的發明蒸氣機，哈格里夫的發明紡織機，愛迪生的法明電燈，馬可尼的發明無綫電報，却是最近二百年尙不到的事，換言之，這些新事物新享受都是爾我的曾祖父母所未曾知道的</p>
<p>大體言之，整個的人類實在是很穎慧很有前途的。我們別忘了今日的人類還只是半人半獸的動物，今已有如許成就，是頗不容易的事。今日的紛亂，今日的戰　，放遠自光看，無非是進化大　之中的一個小波折。今日人們對週　一切的不滿，正表示我們理想之中的標準是在提高着。故而我們雖然失望，卻是不必絕望。須知我們不是在天堂，也不是在地獄，而是在人世間。</p>
<h3>賭</h3>
<p>— 翼君</p>
<p>烟·酒·標·賭，或爲不良的嗜好，或爲不正當的娛樂。我於此四者，幸而都不感興趣。比較感一點興趣偶然也逢塲作戲來一下的却是「睹」，然而我對於「賭」的惡感且鴛乎對「嫖」之上。</p>
<p>烟，可以提神；酒，可以忘憂；嫖，可以洩慾；賭呢？我認爲有百弊而無一利。理由：</p>
<p>第一，賭錢是不懷好意的，一個參加賭的人，總是想贏人錢的，斷不會企圖轍的。賭到激烈之時，不顧他人傾家蕩產，家破人亡，自已決不放棄贏錢機會，這何異於殺人放火的强盜行徑？</p>
<p>第二，賭錢多半是要輸錢的。普通的賭，勝敗之數，固然也賴技術，主要還是靠機遇。機遇不可能次次好，却很可能次次壞。機遇襲，使你輸；機遇好，贏了，可是下次碰到壞機遇，往往是把贏得的輸去之外，還要輸血本。輸錢的人總是火氣大的，越轍得多，越來得兇；越來得兇，越輸得多。氣極了，往往不惜孤注一擲，弄得傾家蕩產。</p>
<p>第三，賭錢的費心機，損健康，耗時間，簡直是無可比喻的了。每個人的神經，一分一秒都是極度的緊張，在未繼牌之前，抱着極大的希望與恐懼，旣攤牌之後，除勝者一人外，其餘都是萬分的失望與追悔。如是緊張的塲面，一塲一塲接下去，天黑了，開電燈，電燈熄了，點洋臘，黑夜過去了，黎明時還不干休。時間，精力，健康的損失，莫此爲甚了。</p>
<p>第四，有人以防爲交際的方式，聯絡感情的途徑。但據我的觀察，常是適得其反的　一個平常慷慨的人，在賭塲上往往就變得極小氣的了，一個大餅錢，也是在所必爭的。我常見雖是平日極要好的朋友，在賭塲上有時爲了一個大餅錢而爭得面紅耳赤，有時爲了一句話而「不歡而散，有時爲了一件芝蔴大的事而演「全武行」。這類的情形，不一而足。</p>
<p>賭的幣害，當然不止於此，但光就是這四大罪狀，已足使我高呼「賭爲萬惡首」了。</p>
<h3>江西雙身從舊聞</h3>
<p>— 尢墨君</p>
<p>七月二十日本報第五版特載南昌航訊，謂贛籍一雙身人「劉聖階·劉聖隄」現正在南昌，以十五萬元門票收入，以作展覽，幷擬赴滬舉行，以飽滬上人士的觀　一云云。同日本報一今古奇觀　欄幷特繪岡誌奇。二十三日本報第五版又載有「雙身人」廿二日赴潯，轉京滬一帶展覽電訊。時當炎暑，預料此一對「雙身人到滬後，必能轟動一時，資爲談助。</p>
<p>按此一對「雙身人」今已二度到滬了。他們弟兄二人初次到滬之年爲公滕一八九二年，即淸光緒十八年，歲次壬辰，見葉鞠裳緣督廬日記鈔記六農歷四月十八日所記。記云：「十八日携　兒觀奇童。兩兒　生，皆無臍，即於當臍有肉相連，形如『甬』，長約三寸許，靑筋外露，膚色如肉瘤，據云江西人，「按」甬爲鐘柄，見周禮。本報航訊亦云：「他們之間的唯一聯系，是在脅部有一塊拳大的肉團，有時可能伸縮到寸許的距離，但這是不常有的現象。　以葉記證航訊，則今來滬之「雙身人」，卽葉公所見之</p>

<p>日記又載他倆之動作云：　一人飲則兩人同醉，食則不能共飽坐則同坐，臥則同臥。兩人共作一事，一使右手，一使左手，指臂相連　無稍隔　證以航訊云：　飲食方面，只要一個人暍了酒，其他的一個亦會醉上心頭。……但是，若是一個人吃飯，却不能同時均飽，而各人吃　時掌箸的手勢，亦各不相同．一個是用本能的右手，左邊的一個却是相反的用左手。各人用左手或右手去扶碗　云云，亦無不一一相符合。是可證葉記所載之「奇童」即今來滬之「雙身人一。</p>
<p>公目他倆爲「奇童」，云：「祖母與父挈之來。……貌亦俊偉，脩短如一。」現據航訊，此一對奇童現已六十二歲。這番重蒞申江，作一前度劉郎　，當不勝其今昔之感了！</p>

<h3>Crowds Gather on Mogan Mountain; Weng Wenhao, Yu Hongjun, Wang Yunwu, and Wang Shijie All Arrive; The President Hosts a Banquet and Inquires About Financial and Economic Matters</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Mogan Mountain, July 29th] President Chiang spent the entire day of the 29th touring the mountain. Weng Wenhao, Wang Yunwu, Xu Baiyuan, Yan Jiagan, and Wang Shijie arrived here together today upon being summoned. Wang Shijie also brought his son, Wang Jiwu. Weng and the others took a special plane from Nanjing at 1:00 PM, arrived in Hangzhou at around 3:00 PM, then transferred to cars and drove directly to Mogan Mountain, arriving at the mountain at around 6:00 PM. The President summoned Weng and the others at 8:00 PM and kept them for dinner, extensively consulting them on current financial, economic, and monetary issues. Weng and the others did not leave until around 10:00 PM and spent the night at the Mogan Mountain Hotel. Yu Hongjun also arrived in Hangzhou from Shanghai on the afternoon of the 29th upon being summoned, and then immediately went up the mountain.</p>
<p>President Yu Hongjun met with this newspaper's reporter at the Mogan Mountain Hotel at 6:00 PM this evening. When the reporter asked about the general situation after the issuance of large-denomination banknotes, he stated that prices have now shown a significant trend toward stabilization. The reason for achieving such success is due to the government's four major policy decisions: (1) contracting currency, (2) selling off materials, (3) balancing foreign exchange, and (4) absorbing overseas remittances. These items have been thoroughly implemented, and a large batch of US aid materials will arrive in mid-August, so there is no reason for prices to rise again. Regarding the Legislative Yuan's recent passage of a bill restricting the increased issuance of currency, he stated that there are many reasons for rising prices, and currency is only one of them. After arriving here, he had an audience with the President. The President inquired in detail about Shanghai's prices and financial problems, as well as how to handle the arrest of market speculators.</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Mogan Mountain, July 29th] Weng Wenhao and five others arrived here today upon being summoned and went up the mountain at 6:30 PM, staying at the Mogan Mountain Hotel. The newly appointed Chief of the Zhejiang Provincial Police and Security Department, Mao Sen, also came and stayed at the Linhai Villa. After arriving here, they gave a brief talk to this newspaper's reporter. Weng said that he came upon being summoned and also to escape the summer heat. Wang Yunwu said that the property tax bill did not pass this time, but it will be discussed again next time. As for the fundraising for the special relief donation, it will definitely be completed before the end of this month. Xu Baiyuan said that after US aid arrives, it should be used frugally, and he also believes that contracting currency will have no impact on production. Wang Shijie praised the beautiful scenery of Mogan Mountain and said that this place and the magnificence of Lushan can complement each other. Afterwards, the reporter subtly asked Director Weng whether Mogan Mountain could replace Lushan as the summer capital this year. Weng smiled and said he did not know.</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Mogan Mountain, July 29th] Chiang Ching-kuo and his wife, along with their sons, climbed Mogan Mountain yesterday to pay their respects to the President and his wife. At noon, the President's family gathered for a meal. Chiang Ching-kuo went down the mountain that evening, and the grandchildren stayed on the mountain to serve. The President showed great care for his grandchildren and asked them about their schoolwork and how they spent their leisure time. The President gave many instructions on the construction of Mogan Mountain, telling Director Wang that forests should be planted on Ta Mountain and that some places should be used as pastures. This morning, the President wore a black Xiangyunsha casual outfit and lay on a rattan chair, facing the sun, looking around at the morning scenery nearby. More than twenty villagers came to the mountain and asked for his signature, which was granted, and they left joyfully. Xuan Tiewu came to pay his respects, and the President inquired in detail about the political and economic situation in Shanghai and gave instructions on his work. After completing his official business, Xuan went down the mountain to Hangzhou and then to Shanghai. (For news of Xuan's arrival in Shanghai, please see page four)</p>
<p>[Central News Agency Dispatch from Mogan Mountain, July 29th] Governor of the Central Bank, Yu Hongjun, arrived at Mogan Mountain at 4:00 PM on the 29th and immediately paid his respects to the President to report on his duties. According to Yu, speaking to reporters, since this bank issued larger denominations of banknotes, the government has tightened credit and sold off materials, so the prices that once caused waves soon stabilized. The issuance of larger denominations of banknotes this time was due to the lack of banknotes in various places and the difficulty in turnover for industry and commerce. It was really to meet the needs of the facts, and only the denomination of the banknotes was increased, not the number of banknotes issued. This should be specially stated. The recently implemented foreign exchange settlement certificate method has been quite effective in absorbing overseas remittances. Yu also said that the general economic situation is quite optimistic.</p>
<p>[Report from This Newspaper's City Office] Upon receiving a telegram from the President, Yu Hongjun returned to Shanghai from Nanjing yesterday morning and then went to Hangzhou, making a special trip to Mogan Mountain to pay his respects to the President. In addition to reporting on his duties, Yu's trip is said to provide detailed opinions on the control of finance and prices in the future, so that the authorities can legislate a plan and unify command of price management in the future.</p>
<p>Senior Advisors and National Policy Advisory Committee Members: The President Has Carefully Approved Them</p>
<p>[Dispatch from This Newspaper's Nanjing Office, July 29th] The President will recruit highly respected individuals to serve as senior advisors and members of the National Policy Advisory Committee to the Presidential Office. It is learned that the President has been extremely careful in selecting these talents, but has recently finalized the list.

<h3>Thirty-Six Supervisory Commissioners for Twelve Administrative Offices; Elected by the Control Yuan; Sending Personnel to Thoroughly Investigate the Truth of the July 5th Incident</h3>
<p>[Dispatch from This Newspaper's Nanjing Office, July 29th] The Control Yuan held its 26th meeting at 10:00 AM on the 29th, chaired by Director Yu. After the Secretariat reported on the minutes of the previous meeting, Cao Dexuan and more than twenty others proposed a temporary motion: "It is proposed that this Yuan quickly send commissioners to thoroughly investigate the truth of the tragic case of the Northeast students in Beiping on July 5th." After being submitted for discussion, it was unanimously approved without objection. Then, the election of supervisory commissioners for the administrative offices was conducted. Some candidates had submitted their resignation of candidate qualifications due to certain reasons. The voting began at 11:15 AM and ended at 11:45 AM. After the ballots were counted immediately, thirty-six supervisory commissioners for twelve administrative offices were thus produced. The reasons for the temporary motion of Cao Dexuan and others are as follows: "Since the tragic case of the Northeast students in Beiping on July 5th, not only are the elders of the Northeast extremely indignant, but they are also running around and appealing to all parties. At a time when the military campaign against bandits is constantly tense, this move in Beiping is really related to the safety and security of the overall situation. The tragedy occurred nearly a month ago, and there has not yet been a reasonable solution. Allowing it to fester like this will give the cunning bandits an opportunity to take advantage of it. The impact on the future is unimaginable. This can be seen from the evolution of the July 5th Incident. Therefore, it is earnestly requested that this Yuan immediately send personnel to Beiping to thoroughly investigate the truth in order to handle it. It is really essential."</p>
<p>[Dispatch from This Newspaper's Nanjing Office, July 29th] The supervisory committee's supervisory commissioners for each supervisory district and the supervisory commissioners for each administrative office were elected by vote on the morning of the 29th. The results are recorded as follows:</p>

<p>Jiangsu-Zhejiang District: Ni [omitted character], Yu Peihou, Qing Shen'an.</p>

<h3>The Indirect Purpose of Premier Weng's Proclamation; To Dismiss Groundless Peace Rumors; Continuing to Maintain Friendly Relations with the Soviet Union</h3>
<p>[Dispatch from This Newspaper's Nanjing Office, July 29th] People in the capital who read Premier Weng's proclamation, "Distinguish Right from Wrong and Walk Through National Difficulties Together," believe that it is of great significance for Weng, as the head of the government's executive branch, to issue such a composed proclamation to the people at a time when the European and Asian situation is obviously becoming more serious. A diplomatic and social figure familiar with the evolution of the situation in China over the past three years pointed out that the indirect purpose of Premier Weng's proclamation is to dismiss the recent groundless peace rumors. The perpetrators of the peace rumors are the "third parties" in Beiping and Hong Kong. Those who are tainted with it are either excessively naive or have ulterior motives. It is no longer possible to talk about peace today. The tension in the current situation in Berlin and the increasing exposure of the CCP's rebellion, its international nature are sufficient to prove the meaning of the proclamation's statement that "the national people have reached the point of life and death, and there is no room for ambiguity and hesitation." A related official revealed that this proclamation by Premier Weng is domestic in nature. Therefore, although the Communist International is mentioned in it, the Soviet Union is not mentioned. He hinted that this article will not have any consequences in diplomacy. China and the Soviet Union will continue to maintain friendly relations, and pending issues will also be negotiated and resolved through normal channels.</p>
<h3>Economic Issues Between China and Hong Kong; Negotiations Between Both Sides in Nanjing</h3>
<p>The Official Exchange Rate of the Hong Kong Dollar Will Be Abolished</p>
<p>[Dispatch from This Newspaper's Guangzhou Office, July 29th] According to Hong Kong news: Senior Chinese and British officials are currently conducting negotiations in Nanjing on economic issues between China and Hong Kong, which may include (1) prohibiting the laundering of Hong Kong dollars and legal tender. (2) All funds for commercial exchanges between China and Hong Kong shall be handled in accordance with foreign exchange settlement certificates. (3) We will abolish the official exchange rate of legal tender against the Hong Kong dollar. (4) The China-Hong Kong agreement will be implemented immediately and measures will be strengthened.</p>
<h3>Cheng Qian Attends the Hunan Provincial Assembly; Makes His First Policy Report</h3>
<p>[Dispatch from This Newspaper's Changsha Office, July 29th] Cheng Qian attended the Provincial Assembly on the 29th and made his first policy report since taking office, lasting one hour. It was divided into five parts: people, construction, finance, education, and security. Cheng emphasized that although the current situation in Hunan is fortunately stable, there is a possibility of becoming a war zone at any time. Saving Hunan should emphasize economic construction, but since the internal turmoil has not ended today and the economy has not improved, symptomatic work cannot be delayed. Therefore, we will make every effort to establish local self-defense forces and urge them to complete it. We hope that the Assembly will support security expenditures. If the province's defense expenditures rely entirely on the central government, then given the central government's financial resources today, the province's self-defense forces will be difficult to realize.</p>
<h3>The County Magistrate's Wife Blocks the Road and Weeps, Asking for Justice for Her Husband</h3>
<p>When Cheng left the meeting place, Ms. Tan Zilian, the wife of the former Dayan County Magistrate Huang Yingchuan who was killed, blocked the road and wept, asking for justice for her husband. Cheng repeatedly said, "It will definitely be done." Ms. Tan also held a large number of records of her husband's murder and distributed them to reporters, earnestly asking them to uphold justice.</p>
<h3>The慰勞 Delegation Returns to Nanjing</h3>
<p>Relief for Refugees and Wounded Soldiers is Imminent</p>
<p>[Dispatch from This Newspaper's Nanjing Office, July 29th] The慰勞 delegation to the Northeast and North China, led by团长刘哲, flew to Ping and transferred to the front lines to offer condolences. The work has now been completed and the delegation flew back to Nanjing at 2:00 PM on the 29th. Liu did not look tired when he got off the plane. Liu told reporters that the spirit of the delegation's trip was more important than the material, because they only brought 10 billion yuan and 200,000 rations.馮雲仙, one of the members of the delegation, told reporters that the soldiers on the front lines can hold a confident winning attitude and that they are determined not to believe certain negative rumors. However,馮雲仙 believed that the relief of refugees and the treatment of wounded soldiers were imminent facts that we should face squarely.</p>

<h3>We Continue to Negotiate and Sign Treaties of Friendship with Various Countries in Central and South America</h3>
<p>The Plan to Increase Training of Envoys is Implemented Step by Step</p>
<p>[Dispatch from This Newspaper's Nanjing Office, July 29th] Information from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs: In recent years, the international status of the twenty countries in Central and South America has become increasingly important, and their relationship with our country has also become increasingly close. In order to promote friendly relations and enhance the status of overseas Chinese, our government has successively negotiated and signed treaties of friendship and commerce with various countries. This Ministry has also formulated a plan to increase and adjust the envoys in various countries in Central and South America, which has been implemented step by step since 1947. At present, there are five embassies, seven legations, three consulates general, two consulates, two vice consulates, and one office. The countries that have not yet established envoys or have established concurrent envoys without resident ambassadors have also been planned as a whole. Our country's envoy to Panama is currently concurrently stationed in Honduras and El Salvador.</p>
<h3>Encouraging Overseas Chinese Capital to Return Home for Production is a Kind of Self-Help Plan; Dong Xianguang Says the Government is Determined to Solve Economic Difficulties</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency Dispatch from Nanjing, July 29th] At a press conference on the 29th, Director Dong Xianguang responded to a reporter's inquiry about the government's change in the management of overseas remittances, which has been reported in various ways, asking to show the details of the current methods: The inquiry is presumably referring to the "Regulations on Application for Importing Overseas Chinese Capital and Funds of Nationals Abroad for Investment in Domestic Production Enterprises" recently promulgated by the government. The full text of these regulations was announced yesterday. The main purpose is to encourage overseas Chinese capital and funds of nationals abroad to return home and engage in domestic production enterprises. Although our country's policy of controlling foreign exchange has been very effective, it is unavoidable that the needs of domestic industry have not been fully taken into account. In order to meet the needs of the industrial sector and promote production, these regulations have been promulgated. In short, the spirit of these regulations can be summarized as follows: (1) Machinery and equipment, etc., required for enterprises that are needed domestically are allowed to be imported. (2) Raw materials required to maintain existing enterprises are allowed to be imported by returning overseas Chinese capital as collateral materials. This point also has two layers of meaning: one is to protect the currency value of the investor himself, and the other is to supplement the insufficient raw materials of existing enterprises. (3) In the past, merchants have imported highly profitable luxury goods from abroad by falsely using the names of overseas Chinese. Therefore, in these regulations, strict prevention and control must be added to this possible situation. It is firmly believed that the implementation of these regulations will definitely meet actual needs, and the application procedures are not complicated. The competent authorities will provide applicants with effective convenience as much as possible.</p>
<p>Secondly, these regulations are also a kind of self-help plan to cooperate with US aid. Although the amount of US aid is quite large, it is very clear that it is insufficient. China deeply appreciates the generosity of the United States and understands its own responsibilities, using all its assets to adapt to the current economic environment. Therefore, it is deeply hoped that this new method can absorb a large amount of foreign capital from Chinese nationals and use it for domestic production enterprises.</p>
<p>During the War of Resistance Against Japan, the government would advance both the War of Resistance and national construction with the greatest determination. The government today holds the same determination to solve the difficult problems in the economy.</p>
<h3>Hu Shi's Speech; There is No Need to Establish the Suppression and Construction Committee; National Representatives Should Not Receive Annual Fees; Convening a Temporary National Assembly is Really Inappropriate</h3>
<p>[Dispatch from This Newspaper's Beiping Office, July 29th] Hu Shi recently commented on whether the Suppression and Construction Committee should be established, whether national representatives should receive annual fees, and whether a national assembly should be convened, saying: Under the current circumstances, there is really no need to establish the Suppression and Construction Committee. The establishment of this organization will not benefit the Suppression and Construction work. As for the annual fees of national representatives, I also believe that they should definitely not be received. The national representatives are all people of status in society, and they already have occupations and fixed incomes. They should not take salaries from the government and increase the burden on the people. There is no need to convene a temporary national assembly to discuss amending the constitution. Whether a constitution is good or bad must be tested over a considerable period of time to know its strengths and weaknesses before starting to modify it. Our constitution has only been implemented for a few months, and we have not seen the advantages and disadvantages, so it is really inappropriate to convene a temporary national assembly.</p>

<p>Commentary</p>
<h3>On Selfishness Zheng Huachi</h3>
<p>Many of humanity's evils are all produced by selfishness. Taking the world as a whole, undoubtedly, the world has now formed two major groups, one is the democratic group led by the United States, and the other is the communist group led by the Soviet Union. The United States and the Soviet Union are competing for supremacy, making the people of the whole world uneasy. Before genetics confirms that the wisdom and abilities of the world's ethnic groups are truly different, we can only admit that Yan Zi's words are correct: "What kind of person was Shun? What kind of person am I? Anyone who strives can be like him." Since human wisdom and ability are the same, why must the United States and the Soviet Union compete for supremacy and make the whole world uneasy? My answer is: The United States and the Soviet Union are both too selfish. Furthermore, taking China as an example, the corruption of Chinese politics and the greed of officials are also slowly evolved from selfish psychology. For decades, the figures on the Chinese political stage have always been the same people after selection. Are those figures who have dominated the Chinese political stage for more than 20 years truly capable and talented? I don't think so. The country's affairs have been brought to such a terrible state, and the people are suffering to such an extent. I dare not say that they should bear full responsibility, but at the very least, they should learn from the style of British and French politicians and voluntarily retire to allow newcomers to try. Politics is an organism and also needs metabolism. If politics is corrupt, new blood should be injected. But the situation in China is not like that. The people of the whole country are loudly calling out: "We want change, we want big change! We want reform, we want big reform!" But in reality, the changes are still made by the old people. Why? My answer is also the word "selfishness." How should the term selfishness be explained? I will first give a definition: "All behaviors that harm others and benefit oneself are called selfishness." Selfish behavior must harm others, but it does not necessarily benefit oneself. Sometimes it even harms oneself. For example, war always results in both sides being hurt. Why do people have selfish psychology and behavior? I think it is produced by two motives: (1) to seek survival, and (2) due to laziness.</p>
<p>First, if humans want to survive, they must have several minimum conditions: such as the satisfaction of clothing, food, housing, transportation, and entertainment. The distribution of natural resources in various parts of the Earth is very uneven. What one country has, other countries often lack, or even have none at all, so they compete with each other, resulting in the most tragic world wars in human history. After the First World War, the German slogan was "A nation without space." This means that the German nation has no space and cannot survive. So the German slogan was "We must strive for space in order to survive." This is an important reason for the occurrence of World War II.</p>
<p>To solve the conditions necessary for human survival, the most reasonable way is for humans to have a spirit of mutual assistance and help each other, exchanging goods for goods. In this way, everyone can have the necessities of life, and everyone can have plenty of food and clothing and live in peace and happiness. The world's disputes can naturally be eliminated, and large-scale wars can naturally be extinguished. This is humanity's highest ideal, and it may not be easy to achieve in a short time. Since this most ideal method cannot be achieved for the time being, then humans can only take a step back and seek the next best thing. Although the types and quantities of natural resources are limited, the changes in matter are infinite. We can use scientific knowledge and industrial technology to combine certain substances into a new substance, which is what is called "synthetic products" in chemistry. During World War II, the Germans used plant fibers to make clothing materials, used coal to make gasoline, and used hydrocarbons to make rubber substitutes, solving many difficult problems. Americans made even more new inventions during World War II, and their results were even better. The annual production of artificial rubber in the United States in 1939 was only 6.7 million pounds, but in 1942 it increased to 400 million pounds, an increase of 60 times in just three years. The quantity of artificial rubber in the United States was not only more than that of Germany, but its quality was also better than that of Germany. The United States is the most developed country in the automobile industry, and everyone knows the importance of rubber in the automobile industry. According to American scientists, the greatest contribution of Americans during World War II was the success of artificial rubber, which is absolutely true. If humans can help each other and exchange materials, then they will not feel the lack of materials; or use existing raw materials to manufacture what is lacking, then the problem of material shortages can still be solved. All the conditions required for survival can be met, and selfish psychology and behavior should be eradicated.</p>
<p>Second, humans have a bad habit, which is that they want to eat ready-made food, use ready-made things, and are unwilling to spend time thinking, time finding, or effort doing. In other words, it is laziness. Lazy people are the most selfish. To correct the disease of laziness, in my personal opinion, the best method is to promote the spirit of science. The development of science cannot be achieved overnight, nor can it be done by the power of one or two people. Scientific inventions are due to many scientists sacrificing their lives' energy, studying problems step by step, and accumulating experience bit by bit. The work that predecessors did not complete is continued by successors. When enough experience has been accumulated, there will naturally be new discoveries. Some lazy people think that scientific inventions are accidental, but in fact, people are thinking about it every day and working on it all the time. Familiarity breeds skill, which is the main reason for scientific invention. Accidental discoveries are just a way for people to deceive themselves. Pasteur, the ancestor of bacteriology, has a famous saying: "Work, work, always work!" This best represents the spirit of scientists!</p>
<p>After eight years of long-term resistance war, China's vitality was greatly damaged, social order was destroyed, and production was halted, resulting in social unrest and the people's livelihood becoming increasingly difficult. This is the consequence of war. The victors and the defeated suffer the same consequences. Even England and France are like this, let alone China? Material losses are easy to compensate for and are not worth worrying about. Under the current circumstances in China, what is most worrying is the widespread selfishness of people in all classes across the country. The thoughts and behaviors of people in China generally have a very bad idea: as long as it is something that is beneficial to themselves, they can all do it, and even do it blatantly. They do not consider the consequences, whether it is harmful to society or harmful to the country. Society is an organism, and the cells that make up society are citizens. If the citizens themselves are not good, then the society will certainly not be good. Now, people in general do not examine themselves or reflect on themselves, but instead blame society every day. Isn't this reversing the root?</p>
<p>My discussion of selfishness here is not from the perspective of a religious or moralist. Religious people persuade people to do good and use God's punishment as a warning, which is inevitably superstitious; moralists persuade people to do good, saying that if your character is good and your morals are high, then the world will admire you, which is inevitably pedantic. I am persuading people from the standpoint of a person who studies science. The spirit of science is to promote cooperation and respect reason. If everyone cooperates with one heart and one mind, all problems can be solved. If you often use reason, then you will never do things that harm others and benefit yourself. This is the minimum condition for being a person, and it can also be said to be humanity's highest ideal.</p>

<p>[This Newspaper, Shenyang, 29th Dispatch] Raphan flew to Shenyang from Beiping at 7:00 PM on the 29th. He is scheduled to visit Commander Wei at 10:00 AM on the 30th for talks. He will attend a banquet hosted by Wei in the afternoon and prepare to exchange views with the heads of the industrial and mining transportation departments. He is scheduled to leave Shenyang and fly to Beiping at 4:00 PM on the afternoon of the 30th.</p>
<p>[This Newspaper, Shenyang, 29th Dispatch] Raphan is scheduled to visit Mayor Dong Wenqi on the 30th.

<h3>Merger of the Commodity Tax and Direct Tax Bureaus: Tax Evasion Can Be Reduced</h3>
<p>Talk by Jiang Shuge, Director of the National Taxation Bureau</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 29th Dispatch] The reform of China's tax system will be gradually completed. The procedure for merging the Commodity Tax and Direct Tax Bureaus of the Ministry of Finance into the National Taxation Bureau is already being processed. The institutions in various provinces, cities, and counties have also been ordered to merge quickly. According to Jiang Shuge, the new director of the National Taxation Bureau, after the merger of commodity tax and direct tax, the institutions can be reduced, the authority can be concentrated, and under mutual coordination, the number of tax evasions can be reduced and tax revenue can be increased. For example, in the operation of yarn factories, because there are resident staff handling the collection of commodity tax, the number of raw materials used can be referred to and the business situation can be estimated. Therefore, the opportunity for tax evasion can be reduced. Before the war, China's commodity tax revenue was only in a secondary position in the national tax and was far less than the bulk of national tax revenue. However, during and after the war, due to the efforts of the people in charge, the amount of tax revenue has been greatly increased and has become the first in the national tax. Now, with the good foundation of commodity tax extended to direct tax, the increase in tax revenue in the future should be something to be imagined.</p>

<h3>Wu Tiecheng Discusses the Situation in Southeast Asia, Advocates Granting Autonomy to the Natives; Soviet Union's Foreign Policy "Two Steps Forward, One Step Back"</h3>
<p>[United Press, Nanjing, 29th Dispatch] Wu Tiecheng, Secretary-General of the Kuomintang, told United Press reporters on the 29th, when discussing the situation in Southeast Asia, that colonial countries should immediately allow all ethnic groups to establish autonomous governments to stem the expansion of communism.</p>
<p>He said: "Politically, colonial countries will take advantage of unrest and instability to delay the realization of their promises to the native peoples - the establishment of autonomous governments and independence, but the Reds will continue to incite the native peoples to revolution to overthrow the ruling forces. Then, economically, the rich resources in these regions will be lost among the democratic countries. "Therefore, the only way to solve the Southeast Asian problem is to grant autonomy to the native peoples and assist them in establishing strong governments. This will effectively prevent communist propaganda and in-government activities."</p>
<p>Wu said of China's position: "China is the vanguard of resisting world communism, just as it resisted fascism in World War II."</p>
<p>He said that the Chinese Communist Party's condemnation of Tito undoubtedly confirmed that the CCP "is the agent of the Third International in China and is fighting for world communism." The current war in China is a desperate battle between patriots and communist aggression instigated by foreign powers."</p>
<p>When asked about his views on the Berlin crisis, Wu said: "The Soviet Union, like Germany before World War II, is taking the political initiative everywhere and adopting an aggressive policy. When it gets half of what it wants, it may seek an agreement to wait for a new action to get the remaining half."</p>
<p>He described the Soviet Union's foreign policy as: "Two steps forward, one step back."</p>

<h3>British Foreign Secretary Bevin Announces Halt to Demobilization in the House of Commons to Cope with Overall Situation; His Majesty's Government Willing to Negotiate Entire European Issue with Soviet Authorities if They Have Sincere Desire for Peace</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Report] London, 29th Broadcast: British Foreign Secretary Bevin, a few hours before the Western Allies presented a new note to the Soviet Union, stated in the House of Commons on the 29th that a portion of the British demobilization plan has been halted due to the Berlin crisis, but if the Soviet Union lifts the Berlin blockade, it will begin negotiations with the Soviet Union on the entire European issue. He said that once the blockade is lifted, he will be ready to convene a four-power foreign ministers' meeting. Eliminating obstacles to negotiation is the immediate task. Bevin also stated that if the Soviet Union persists in its Berlin policy, it will inevitably lead to war, and the British government is determined to take any appropriate measures to cope with the overall situation. He acknowledged that the implementation of Soviet policy will make the situation in Berlin and Germany increasingly difficult, but "I do not believe that the policies of the wartime allies must inevitably lead to the use of force." Bevin said that the Western countries are always ready to discuss with the Soviet Union the Berlin currency issue, which the Soviet Union accuses of causing the current crisis. "Unless threatening means are used, we are happy to seek a reasonable solution with the Soviet Union through negotiations on any issue that may cause difficulties between the four governments." Bevin said that the scope of the four-power meeting could be expanded to include other issues.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Report] London, 29th Broadcast: After Bevin announced in the House of Commons that Britain had halted part of its demobilization plan, Churchill questioned him, saying that Britain is still demobilizing, 20,000 people per month. Churchill demanded that Bevin provide a guarantee to halt all demobilization plans, to which Bevin replied that the matter is being considered by the government and will be decided within days.</p>
<p>[United Press London 29th Dispatch] US Ambassador to the Soviet Union Smith and Bevin's personal secretary Roberts left Berlin for Moscow on the same plane on the 29th to meet with French Ambassador to the Soviet Union Chatenot. According to the original plan, the three will jointly request a meeting with Molotov. Smith, as the head of the Western envoys to the Soviet Union, will read the Western statement and express the Western views orally to Molotov. Then, he intends to listen to any opinions of Molotov, and before leaving, he will submit a memorandum to Molotov. Although the Western allies are trying their best to keep it secret, many parts of their plan have been leaked. After repeated consideration here, the Foreign Office emphasized that the reason for the delay in issuing the reply to the Soviet Union is the French cabinet turmoil. Sources with absolute access to information said that the reason for the delay in the reply to the Soviet Union is actually because Britain has many difficulties with the procedures and forms of the note.</p>
<h3>Danube River Freedom of Navigation Conference Opens Today in Southern Capital; Soviet Union Sends Delegation Led by Vyshinsky to Attend</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Prague, 29th Dispatch] The Soviet delegation to the Danube River Conference, convened in Belgrade and led by Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Vyshinsky, arrived in Czech capital Prague today. Czech Foreign Minister Clementis personally welcomed them at the airfield.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, London, 29th Dispatch] The Danube River Conference will open in Belgrade tomorrow. British diplomatic circles are highly skeptical of the effectiveness of the conference. In addition to the representatives of the four countries, Britain, the Soviet Union, the United States, and France, there are also representatives from six reparations countries: Ukraine, Romania, Hungary, Yugoslavia, Czechoslovakia, and Austria. The Austrian representative will attend as an observer. Greece applied to participate in the conference at the last minute, which has made British officials uneasy, because the Danube River Conference agreement signed by the four countries, the United States, the Soviet Union, France, and Britain, on December 7, 1946, did not include Greece. The purpose of the conference is to make navigation on the Danube River as free as on the sea, as stated in Foreign Minister Bevin's declaration at the Paris Conference in October 1946. Before the war, there were 3,500 ships sailing between the east and west sections of the river, passing through Central and Eastern Europe, with 2,400 belonging to the six reparations countries. In practice, it has been completely suspended since 1945. Recently, as a result of the Soviet blockade of ships sailing out of the US and British occupation zones of Germany and Austria, the countries of Central Europe have lost this ideal waterway connecting them with Southern Germany and Austria. Well-informed British circles believe that the Soviet Union may not be willing to lift the blockade of the river, because the Soviet Union has declared to the Danube River countries that they cannot benefit from American aid. However, diplomatic circles expect that if the Soviet Union and its satellite countries are stubborn, the entire Danube River case will be submitted to the four-power foreign ministers' meeting for handling, because the Western powers will not be in the minority at this meeting.</p>
<h3>Berlin City Council Meeting; Communist Councilors Walk Out; Soviets Deliberately Create Split</h3>

<h3>Deteriorating Relations Between Yugoslavia and Hungary; Hungary Arbitrarily Arrests People; Politically Motivated</h3>
<p>[United Press Budapest 28th Dispatch] Reliable sources disclosed on the 28th that the Hungarian political police have arrested the press counselor of the Yugoslavian embassy, ​​Bauer, who is related to the case of a Yugoslavian student affiliated with the pro-Communist Information Bureau being killed. A few days ago, at the official invitation of Hungary, two officials from the Yugoslavian embassy accompanied Bauer to the headquarters of the Hungarian political police in Budapest, where Bauer was immediately arrested. Hungarian officials refused to comment on this on the 28th, and the Yugoslavian embassy only said that Bauer is currently in Budapest but not in the embassy. According to reliable sources, after Bauer was escorted to the headquarters, he was taken to another room for questioning alone and then arrested. At the same time, Yugoslavia protested to Hungary against the Hungarian government's opposition to the Union of South Slavs in Hungary, but the Hungarian government refuted it, calling the move an "improper interference in overseas Chinese affairs."</p>

Evatt acknowledged that the chances of concluding a peace treaty with Japan are slim, but said that the conclusion of this treaty is "a matter of urgency."

Regarding the harassment incidents in Malaya, Evatt said that the Malayan authorities are cooperating with the British and Australian governments to vigorously eliminate the terrorists in Malaya.</p>

<h3>South Korean Party Congress Ends Amidst Enthusiastic Support for Tito; Three Government Leaders Re-Elected to the Central Executive Committee</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Belgrade, 29th Dispatch] The South Korean Party Congress declared its closing today after unanimously supporting Marshal Tito and severing relations with the Communist Information Bureau. The Congress refuted the Communist Information Bureau's condemnation of Tito and re-elected not only Tito but also the other three South Korean leaders who were also condemned by the Information Bureau to the Central Executive Committee. Tito said in his closing speech today, "On behalf of the newly elected Central Executive Committee, I thank you for the trust you have shown in us. We will certainly repay the responsibilities entrusted to us." This speech was unanimously applauded by the representatives.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Belgrade, 29th Dispatch] Officials have announced that Marshal Tito has been re-elected to the Central Executive Committee of the South Korean Party. At the same time, the three people who were expelled by the Communist Information Bureau, South Korean Deputy Prime Minister Carter, Interior Minister Rankovic, and Minister Without Portfolio Djilas, were also re-elected. The South Korean Party Congress held a secret vote to elect its 63 new members of the Central Executive Committee on the 28th. The new Central Executive Committee includes 33 intellectuals, 29 workers, and 1 farmer. In addition, 24 members of the new Central Executive Committee are professional revolutionaries who had been members of the South Korean Party for as long as 17 years before World War II. According to foreign observers, among the generals currently commanding the Yugoslavian army, such as Chief of Staff Popovic and General Dashkevic, the liberator of Belgrade and tank expert of South Korea (whose name was recently seen in the newspapers, saying that Stalin wanted to replace Tito with him), no one has been proposed to the Central Executive Committee, making them serve as members.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Belgrade, 28th Dispatch] The South Korean Congress passed a motion today, stating that the Communist Information Bureau's condemnation was "inaccurate and unfair." It also unanimously passed a motion, approving the attitude of the Central Committee towards the Soviet Bolshevik Party's remarks and stating that the South Korean Party has not abandoned the principles of Marxism and Leninism. After the vote, the entire venue unanimously stood up and sang the Internationale.</p>
<h3>Division to Form New Cabinet, Excluding Communist Party</h3>
<p>[United Press, Helsinki, 29th Dispatch] Finnish President Paasikivi today authorized the new Prime Minister Fagerholm to exclude the Communist Party from his new government. Although the President avoided mentioning the Communist Party, he told Fagerholm that the cabinet does not necessarily have to include the three major political parties in the country, namely the Farmers Party, the Social Democratic Party, and the Communist Party. Fagerholm (Social Democratic Party) immediately announced: He will first try to form a coalition cabinet of the Social Democratic Party and the Farmers Party. If this plan fails, he will form a one-party cabinet of the Social Democratic Party.</p>

<h3>US Senate Discusses Truman's Proposals; Opposition Party Launches Filibuster; Taft Broadcasts Speech, Using Extreme Satire</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 29th Dispatch] When the US Senate discussed the human rights bill on the 29th, the opposition party planned to deliver lengthy speeches in an attempt to obstruct it. However, people from all three parties were quite interested in a compromise plan, although there has been no progress so far. Southern Democrats said that in support of the long debate on the anti-election tax bill, they are prepared to launch a filibuster war. According to Republican senators, they selected the anti-tax voting bill to launch a filibuster war. Southern senators have appointed Stennis to lead the debate, and behind him, about 20 senators have unanimously decided to use lengthy speeches to kill the bill.</p>
<p>Once the Senate filibuster begins, it will take countless time, and other congressional committees will study other proposals submitted by President Truman. Other developments include:</p>
<p>(1) The House Banking Committee summoned former Price Administration Director Porter to discuss price wages and distribution control. (2) The Senate Banking Committee summoned Eccles of the Federal Reserve Board to discuss methods of restricting bank capital. (3) The Senate Foreign Relations Committee convened a meeting to discuss the International Wheat Agreement submitted by Truman to the Senate for approval. (4) Republican House members plan to meet on the afternoon of the 29th to discuss the policy statement issued by Republican leaders on the evening of the 26th, which rejects most of Truman's proposals. House leaders said that they will wait for the results of the Senate filibuster and the Banking Committee.</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 28th Dispatch] Taft, chairman of the US Senate Republican Policy Committee, delivered a broadcast speech today, saying that President Truman's convening of Congress is only a "political means." The President does not want to lower prices before the election. Truman's attempt to blame the Republican Party for the high prices is "a villainous act." He accused the Democratic Party itself of being responsible for this, because of their spending plans. Taft argued that the Republican-controlled Congress should adjourn immediately, but he also said that Republican members will remain in the meeting for about two weeks to discuss the parts of the 18 proposals submitted by Truman that can be regarded as urgent. Taft said, "The President does not lack the power to lower prices. In fact, he does not want to lower prices, especially before the election. He needs the votes of farmers who want agricultural product prices to be high. He needs the votes of workers who want wages to increase."</p>
<h3>Split in Italian General Confederation of Labor</h3>

<h3>Allied Personnel Train Derails South of Kure Port</h3>
<p>Possible Conspiracy by Japanese Workers</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 29th Dispatch] A train carrying Allied personnel derailed south of the former Japanese naval base in Kure Port at 4:50 this morning. This may be the first conspiracy by Japanese people to resist the occupying forces. Fortunately, no Allied personnel were killed or injured on the spot. This morning, a Central News Agency reporter visited Allied officials about this matter. They said that this may have been done by Japanese railway workers who were deeply angered by MacArthur's order to the Japanese government to ban strikes, but no evidence has been obtained to support the above suspicion. In addition, a Japanese passenger car also derailed north of here at 5:30 this morning. There were no deaths or injuries, and the cause of the accident is also unknown.</p>
<h3>MacArthur's Ban on Strikes by Civil Servants Arouses Strong Opposition from All Walks of Life in Japan; Labor Circles Believe it Violates the New Constitution</h3>
<p>[United Press, Tokyo, 29th Dispatch] Teachers from several national universities and primary and secondary schools across the country in Japan continue to strike, openly protesting MacArthur's letter to Prime Minister Yoshida "banning strikes." Vice Minister of Education Arimizu said: If the cabinet does not issue a temporary ban on strikes or complete permanent ban on strikes legislation, he will not be able to stop the spreading strikes.</p>
<p>He also hopes that even after teachers are banned from striking, the government will continue wage negotiations with them, because the low wages of teachers are a widely recognized problem. Generally speaking, Japanese labor is taking an attitude contrary to that of the cabinet, not recognizing MacArthur's letter as an instruction, as the cabinet interprets it. However, before the legislation banning strikes is completed, civil servants are still free to strike. Labor leaders have also accused MacArthur's letter of violating the new constitution praised by the Allied Headquarters. Article 28 of the constitution clearly stipulates: "The right of workers to organize, negotiate, and take collective action shall be protected."</p>
<h3>Major Explosion at Chemical Plant on the Banks of the Rhine; 18 Houses Destroyed, Casualties Reach Over 2,000</h3>

Technicians said: The recent heat wave may be the main reason for the chemical explosion. However, the real cause has not yet been determined.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 28th Dispatch] Leipzig Radio in the Soviet zone broadcast that the French authorities may have used the Badische Anilin- und Soda-Fabrik to manufacture explosives, which caused the unprecedented explosion. According to estimates in the broadcast, more than 600 people died and 1,400 were injured in the explosion.</p>
<h3>Soviet Union Dumps Gold in Hong Kong</h3>
<p>[United Press International, Hong Kong, 28th] The Far Eastern Economic Review reported on the 28th that the Soviet Union's dumping of its gold production may put the world gold market in an embarrassing situation and cause "great concern" among the US Treasury Department, gold producers, and investors.

<h3>Stalin's War Plan as Recounted by a Soviet Veteran (Part 1)</h3>
<p>— Translated by the Editorial Department of this Newspaper</p>
<p>(Editor's note: This article originally appeared in the July issue of Reader's Digest in the United States. The author, Mr. Koepple, is a recently retired Soviet officer currently residing in Paris.)</p>
<p>The Soviet Union recognized earlier than the United States that the Cold War between the two countries had reached its peak, and what would follow would be outright military war. The coup in Czechoslovakia was a step taken by the Communist Party. Other actions, such as accelerating the civil wars in Greece and China, were also tactics to force a final showdown.</p>
<p>As a Soviet officer, I had the opportunity to learn about the content of the Soviet war plan. This war plan, unlike the purely defensive war plans of other world powers, is a plan for taking the initiative to attack.</p>
<p>Undeniably, the Soviet Union does not need war. However, the figures in the Kremlin believe that regardless of whether the Soviet Union needs war, the conflict will eventually come. Because of this belief, they urgently need to prepare a plan on how to launch an attack first.</p>
<p>The Soviet General Staff believes that the future Third World War will be divided into three main stages.</p>
<p>First Stage</p>
<p>First, quickly occupy Western Europe. The Soviet Union believes that with its strong military strength, this can be completed within three weeks.</p>
<p>Second Stage</p>
<p>During this stage, the Soviet Union needs to complete the following steps simultaneously. First, after occupying Western Europe, it will attack the Iberian Peninsula, cross the Mediterranean to the south, and wedge into North Africa. At the same time, it will also attack Iran, Iraq, and Syria, pointing its spearhead at the Suez Canal. Then, it will launch an attack on Franco.</p>
<p>In the Spanish war, with the support of the exiled Republican government in Western Europe and the anti-Franco people in Spain, the Soviet army can easily achieve victory. After resolving Franco, the Soviet army will attack Dakar, an important Atlantic port in French North Africa. Once this area is occupied, the entire South America will be directly threatened.</p>
<p>Contrary to outside speculation, the Soviet Union does not intend to use an attack on Turkey as a springboard to invade the Suez Canal. The Soviet army will use Turkey as a secondary target and detour to seize Gibraltar, eliminating the military role of the Mediterranean.</p>
<p>It is estimated that the Soviet Union can complete the above tasks in three months.</p>
<p>After reaching the above steps, and before the third stage arrives, the Soviet Union will do its best to defend the two wings of Europe to prevent attacks from Britain. This defensive plan requires one hundred divisions to achieve. Half of these one hundred divisions will be borne by the Czech, Polish, and Southern European countries respectively.</p>
<p>Third Stage</p>
<p>This is the final stage of the entire war. The Soviet army will directly attack the Far East, and the decisive war may begin within China. The Soviet Union will supplement the Chinese Communist army with three hundred divisions. The Soviet side estimates that the entire Asian war can be concluded within two years.</p>
<p>Conquering China</p>
<p>After conquering China, the Soviet Union will propose a peace proposal to the United States, dividing the two major spheres of influence. Europe (excluding Britain), the Near East, the Middle East, North Africa, China, and other regions belong to the Soviet Union. India, Vietnam, Indonesia, South America, Britain, and its colonies belong to the United States.</p>
<p>Atomic Bomb</p>
<p>Regarding the atomic bomb, the Soviet Union will use the method of dispersing military supplies to resist atomic bombing.

<h3>The Way to Balance Municipal Finances is to Rectify Tax Collection; Tian Yongqian Returns to Shanghai After Completing Official Duties in Nanjing</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] Tian Yongqian, Director of the Finance Bureau, returned to Shanghai yesterday morning after completing his official duties in Nanjing, having traveled to Nanjing twice on the 20th and 26th of this month to request subsidies from the central government due to the city's financial deficit. It is reported that the Executive Yuan's Budget Committee has decided to grant a one-time subsidy of 1.4 trillion yuan. The municipal finances had been self-sufficient in the past eight months, but the situation was quite different this month, and the additional half-month salary for June was issued to public education personnel, causing the municipal treasury to be unable to bear the burden. However, the Finance Bureau believes that, based on the current situation, rectifying tax collection is still the only solution, but it is not appropriate to target property tax and license tax for the time being.</p>

<h3>A Tragic Scene on the Hai Gui Wheel; Death and Ruined Family, Widow Seeks Relatives; Seduced on the Journey, Sadly Leaping into the Sea in Grief</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] On the China Merchants Bureau's Hai Gui Wheel, which was returning to Shanghai from Qinhuangdao via Tianjin this time, a female passenger committed suicide by jumping into the sea mid-journey. The captain, upon learning of this, immediately launched an investigation, and as a result, found three suspects in this case: Wang Mingquan, Liu Zhenfei, and Xie Rongsheng, and immediately telegraphed the Shanghai Bureau to report. After receiving the telegram, the bureau ordered the police to dispatch personnel to the dock to wait and arrest them. The wheel arrived at the port at 10:00 AM yesterday and docked at Pier No. 7 (formerly the Mitsubishi Pier). Police officers boarded the wheel and arrested the three suspects, Wang and others, and took them to the Police Division on the second floor of the bureau for temporary detention, and began interrogation at about 4:00 PM in the afternoon. It is reported that the woman who committed suicide by jumping into the sea was named Du Zhijie (alias Peng Huizhen), a native of Yingkou, about 30 years old. Her father, Du Jiantang, was formerly the district chief. When Yingkou fell, the whole family</p>
<p>was captured by bandits. This time, the woman was entrusted by her father to a friend, Wang Mingquan, to bring her to Shanghai to seek relatives. Wang was an employee of the Ministry of Communications stationed in Qinhuangdao and happened to be transferred to Guangzhou, so he came to Shanghai to transfer to Guangdong. Du's father entrusted him to accompany his daughter to Shanghai on the way. The woman met a Liu Zhenfei on the ship, who was a major intelligence officer of the Ministry of National Defense, accompanied by his follower Xie Rongsheng, who were taking the wheel to Shanghai to go to Nanjing. Liu was young and beautiful, and the two</p>
<p>fell in love at first sight. They spent day and night together on the ship, and a secret relationship developed. Wang Mingquan witnessed Du and Liu's improper behavior, so he advised Du. Not only did Du not heed the advice, but she said that she was willing to give herself to Liu and was willing to sacrifice everything. Wang was furious when he heard this and immediately threatened that after arriving in Shanghai, he would tell her relatives the whole story, and said that he would report the woman's ginseng, weighing ten pounds, and many pieces of clothing to the police, the military police, and the customs. After being threatened, Du made a big scene on the ship, which inevitably made her the laughingstock of the passengers on the ship, which caused her to be deeply stimulated. It was also heard that the woman had been married for only a little over a year three years ago, and her husband died. In addition, Yingkou fell, and the whole family was captured by bandits, and their property was robbed. Various stimuli gathered in her heart, and she suddenly developed a pessimistic view of life. The wheel left Dalian for Shanghai on the morning of the 26th. On the morning of the 27th, Du</p>
<p>was reported missing. It was only after investigation that she was known to have　committed suicide by leaping into the sea.</p>
<p>The Police Division later found out that Du had an elder cousin, Du Boen, who was practicing law in Shanghai, and telegraphed the Lawyers Association to inquire about Du's lawyer's residence before inviting Du to the bureau. Du arrived at the Police Division at about 4:00 PM, just as the interrogation was underway. The interrogation was completed at about 5:00 PM, and the three criminals were temporarily detained in the Police Division, pending Du's lawyer's opinion, before　transferring them to the local　detention center, and the list of Du's　belongings　left behind was handed over to Du's lawyer, so that they could　be　claimed in the future. Among them, ten pounds of ginseng and many pieces of clothing have already</p>
<p>disappeared. The group is also investigating. Later, the reporter went to Du's lawyer's office to inquire about his opinion on the crowd. According to Du's lawyer, he had no words to answer regarding his cousin's case. Because he had not heard of their coming south beforehand, and he had been separated from his hometown for more than ten years without any news, he was still studying the disposition of the three suspects and only needed to give an explanation to his uncle (referring to Du's father).</p>
<h3>Good Management Committee Tenders for Fishing Wheels; The Fishing Industry Decides to Refuse Bidding; Receives Reporters and Criticizes the Unreasonable Method</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] Recently, the Post-War Rehabilitation and Management Committee published an advertisement for the tender of twenty mobile fishing wheels, post-war rehabilitation materials for the fishing industry. The private fishing industry in this city refused to bid, as the vessels, nominally fishing wheels, were actually vessels that could not go out to fish, and the contract methods stipulated were quite unreasonable. Yesterday afternoon, the Fishing Wheel Business Association hosted reporters and called for justice. According to Chairman Hu Shiyuan and others: (1) These twenty vessels were originally ordered from Australia by the U.S. military during the Pacific War as transportation tools between bird islands and have not undergone reconstruction work. There are no fishing tools on board, no ice fish equipment on the boats, the engine speed is too fast, the gears are not suitable for trawling, and the load capacity is too small, which is not in line with fishing economics. (2) The contract stipulates that the English version shall prevail, which is detrimental to the national image. Among them, the vessels handed over to the government for safekeeping are referred to as the government's transfer of ownership, and the payment method is to convert U.S. dollars into national currency. In addition to paying one-twentieth in advance, nineteen promissory notes are paid, with the face value in national currency, but they are guaranteed to adjust the exchange rate difference at any time, and must be guaranteed by a designated bank for a period of five years. This method cannot be done by any bank. Private fishing believes that the Good Management Committee is simply not sincere in selling in this way, so it requests to form a technical committee with representatives from the fishing company to identify the performance of the fishing vessels and then conduct an open and reasonable research distribution to quell disputes.</p>
<h3>Establishing Secret Accounts and Engaging in Commerce; China Industrial and Mining Bank; Ordered to Suspend Business; Previous and Incumbent Managers to be Investigated According to Law</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] The General Management Office of the China Industrial and Mining Bank in this city formulated temporary measures for secret account accounting, circulated them to various branches for implementation, and repeatedly set up secret accounts, established other names, misappropriated bank funds, and engaged in commerce. Most of its business focus was hidden in the secret accounts. After investigation and verification by the Shanghai Financial Administration Bureau, it was determined that the bank's illegal operation violated the provisions of Article 43 of the Banking Law. The original documents have been attached and sent to the Shanghai Local Court to investigate the previous and current general managers of the bank according to law. It also ordered the Shanghai Branch to suspend business during the period of the court's investigation and await sentencing. During the suspension period, in addition to recovering or paying off existing creditor's rights and debts, it shall not accept any new business. The Shanghai Financial Administration Bureau is currently supervising and handling this matter, and it is also heard that the bureau issued a notice to the three associations of banking, money, and trust industries in this city yesterday, ordering the entire industry to be notified, and ordering the clearing house to immediately stop the bank's check clearing. In addition, the Wuhan Branch of the bank has also been found by the Wuhan Financial Administration Bureau to have violated the law and has been revoked.</p>
<p>Deposit Withdrawals Exceed 90%</p>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] The person in charge of the China Industrial and Mining Bank stated yesterday that they would abide by the authorities' suspension order and clear the accounts immediately. In one day yesterday, more than 90% of the customer deposits were withdrawn. The person in charge also believed that the Ministry of Finance's decisive action against the bank this time was based solely on a one-sided report from the Financial Administration Bureau and lacked factual evidence. However, now that the case has been handed over to the local court for investigation, the truth will surely come to light in the future.</p>
<p>Interview with the Shanghai Branch Manager</p>
<p>Also, according to Wu Kejun, manager of the Shanghai Branch of the China Industrial and Mining Bank, most of the bank's funds are overseas Chinese funds. The former General Manager, Zhai Wenqiao, also served as the manager of the Shanghai Branch. During Zhai's tenure, he did use his authority to take unreasonable measures. Subsequently, the bank's board of directors resolved that Zhai Wenqiao would no longer serve as the manager of the Shanghai Branch, and Qu Shiduo took over. During Qu's tenure, he made every effort to improve the business of the Shanghai Branch. Wu took over until December of last year. The General Manager of the Head Office was also replaced by Zhou Shiguan in February of this year. At 7:00 PM on the 28th, the bank received an order from the Financial Administration Bureau to suspend business. The bank has issued an order to suspend business, and the deposits of all more than 4,000 depositors, totaling more than 500 billion, have been decided to be fully repaid in the next two days to maintain credit.</p>

<h3>Five Robbers Steal Car and Drive to Suzhou, Robbing Pedestrians Along the Way; Military Police in Various Locations Search and Arrest; Arrested in Lili Town</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Suzhou, 29th Report] A Shanghai Xiang Sheng Company business car, license plate number 03:3264, was hijacked by bandits in Shanghai at around midnight this morning and driven to Suzhou along the Shanghai-Suzhou Highway. There were a total of five bandits, two wearing military uniforms and three in plainclothes, carrying a six-inch Browning pistol. Shortly after the car started, the Xiang Sheng driver was forced out, and the bandits drove themselves. At 4:40 AM, the car arrived outside Panmen, Suzhou, and encountered vegetable vendors heading to the market. They immediately stopped and robbed them, but the loot was meager. The bandits then turned onto the Suzhou-Jiashan Highway, arbitrarily stopping and robbing pedestrians along the way. According to reports to the police, a vendor in Maoshantang, Wujiang County, was robbed of three gold rings, three pairs of earrings, and 7.3 million yuan in cash. A cloth merchant in Longqiao, Bachi Jian, was robbed of 80 million yuan, and so on. Upon receiving the reports, military police organs along the road urgently notified various locations by telephone to search and arrest. Unexpectedly, when the bandits' car passed the Zhujiang Bridge in Shengze, it happened to meet a Suzhou-Jiashan long-distance bus. Due to the narrow road, the bandits' car was driven carelessly and overturned into a field, but there was no damage. The bandits scrambled out, abandoned the car, and fled southwest of Shengze with the loot. By the time nearby military police arrived after receiving the report, they were unable to pursue them. At around 3:00 PM, Shao Jintang, a government police officer from Wujiang County, was working in Lili Town when he discovered five diners at a small restaurant acting suspiciously. Suspecting that they were bandits, he reported them to the local police station, who arrested them. Firearms and stolen goods were found, and they immediately confessed. The names of the five bandits are Xuan Limin, Fu Huimin, Sun Haofu, Yao Heshang, and Jin Rongchang, who all admitted to the roadside robbery. They also confessed that they originally planned to drive the car to Hangzhou via Jiaxing and rob along the way, hoping to gain more loot, but they were stopped by the overturned car.</p>
<p>According to reports, the business car belongs to the seventh station of the Xiang Sheng Motor Company at the intersection of Jiaozhou Road and Yuyuan Road. The previous night, driver Chen Weipu was dispatched in response to a customer's call. When he arrived at the intersection of Daxilu and Jing'an Temple Road, five men flagged down the car, instructing him to drive to Beixin Jing. En route, the five passengers suddenly pulled out guns and threatened to force the driver out of the car. They tied his hands and feet with rope, dragged him into the fields, and then drove off to the west. Afterwards, Chen Weipu struggled to break free from the rope and reported the incident to the Chenjiaqiao police station of the police precinct, requesting them to pursue the bandits.</p>

<h3>Elementary School Apprentice Acts as Ghost: Traditional Chinese Medicine Shop Terrified; Three Mysterious Fires Falsely Claimed to Be "Medicine God Great Thief"; Four Notes Left, Handwriting Analysis Solves the Case</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Ye Shudetang Traditional Chinese Medicine Shop, located at 76 Xizang South Road, is owned by Ding Jiwan, a national representative and traditional Chinese medicine practitioner. Qiu Ningsheng is employed as the manager, and there are more than thirty employees and students. In the past month, the shop has experienced three or four fire alarms, causing suspicion and panic.</p>
<p>The first time was at 10:05 PM on June 22nd. After the fire was discovered, it burned until 12:10 AM before being extinguished. The entire front of the two-story warehouse was destroyed, and the doors and windows of the three-story building were also damaged by the fire. Fortunately, there was a sky bridge separating the shop, which was not affected. The manager's bedroom was inside the warehouse, and he was seriously injured while escaping the fire. What was strange was that there were a total of three fire locations, with the other two on the upper floor of the shop. These were extinguished by the shop staff, preventing a major disaster.</p>
<p>The second time was at 9:00 PM on July 10th, when a fire suddenly broke out in the storage room on the second floor of the shop. The doors and windows are usually locked, and there are no flammable materials inside the medicinal materials, so the cause was completely unknown. Fortunately, the fire brigade arrived in time, and the loss was minimal.</p>
<p>The third time was only a few days later, when a burning White Tin cigarette, a box of matches, and a pile of scattered matchsticks and hemp stalks were found on a shelf in the fine materials room. It was clear that they were prepared for ignition to cause a fire. Fortunately, precautions had been taken, and it was discovered early, so it was extinguished. However, after searching the shop, no one smoked White Tin cigarettes, which increased their worries.</p>
<p>Whole Shop in Turmoil: Patrols Day and Night</p>
<p>Afterwards, the owner, manager, shop staff, and apprentices were alarmed and disturbed, and the entire shop was in an uproar. There were special buyers monitoring during the day, and patrols were assigned in shifts at night. Everyone's mood was in a state of terror. Strange notes were successively found in the shop. The tone was similar to that of a god or ghost, and the intention was both a warning and a threat. The first note vaguely stated, "Quickly remove the manager, three apprentices, and two employees surnamed Huang and Zhang, or I will burn people to death and turn the shop to ashes."</p>
<p>The second note vaguely stated, "I am the Medicine God. Your days are numbered. You haven't left yet? How dare you? What's the use of begging my sister? Now I forgive you for removing two colleagues and elementary school students. If you don't leave, I will be rude, and a fierce fire will be born. Wait three more days, special notice."</p>
<p>Doors and Windows Not Opened: Notes Appear Suddenly</p>
<p>The third note was vague. The fourth note was found in the bedroom of accountant Ma Huiren, which was even more bizarre. The accountant patrolled all night, and checked the books and miscellaneous items on the table at 5 AM, and found nothing. But at 8 AM, the doors and windows were closed as before, and the fourth strange note was found under the books, saying: "I am not the Medicine God, I am an unknown great thief. My father had a feud with the shop owner, so I came to seek revenge. Before the appointed day, everyone must leave, or I will burn you alive and turn the shop to ashes. I am the great thief Hua Mazhong."</p>
<p>Handwriting Analysis: Find Clues</p>
<p>Zhang, the deputy director of the Municipal Police Bureau, and Chen Zhiqing, the director of the Songshan branch bureau in charge, attached great importance to this case and repeatedly ordered Chen Kaizhou, the head of the judicial affairs section, to step up the investigation and solve the case within a time limit. Chen, under orders, investigated day and night, and finally arrested the self-proclaimed "great thief" at 4:00 PM on the 26th of this month, and brought him to the bureau for interrogation.</p>
<p>Chen's work focused entirely on the handwriting. The handwriting on all four strange notes was intentionally made to look like a seal script, making it difficult to recognize. However, the original form was still retained in the structure of the characters. For example, the lower left side of the character "san" (散) was written as the character "ri" (日), and the "bu" (不) radical in the character "shen" (神) was mistakenly written as the "yi" (衣) radical. The top of the character "dian" (店) should be "guang" (广), but it was also mistakenly written as "guang" (廣). Among the thirty shop employees, each person's handwriting was compared, and any daily left writings were collected as much as possible. Only Shen Zenghua, an apprentice, showed these characteristics.</p>
<p>Intending to Leave: Reckless Thoughts Arise</p>
<p>Shen Zenghua is eighteen years old, from Ningbo. His father died and his mother remarried, leaving him poor and helpless. He studied for three to five years in his youth and was introduced to Ye Shudetang by someone. According to his confession: he admitted that he set the three fires and left the four notes alone, with no accomplices. The reason was that the work was too hard, the treatment was poor, and two other apprentices bullied him too much. He wanted to quit and find another job, but he was afraid that the original recommender would blame him and not look for another job, so he wanted to scare the shop owner into disbanding the entire shop or dismissing the apprentices, so that he could achieve his goal without admitting his mistakes. As for setting the fire, he had no malicious intent to burn it down. Each time after setting the fire, he was the first to shout and the first to fetch water to put it out. He claimed he was the one who saved the manager from being burned to death by calling out and helping him escape.</p>
<p>The police bureau, based on the confession and verification, believes that Shen Zenghua's arson crime is beyond doubt, but they are still investigating the reasons for the crime, whether it was a long-standing grudge or simply so simple.</p>
<h3>Road Bureau Seriously Selects Future Transportation Personnel</h3>
<p>The two Road Bureaus recently opened a training course for transportation personnel, which was publicly advertised on the 14th of this month. The qualifications were limited to high school graduates, and 200 people were selected. More than 2,000 people applied for the examination. The bureau's director, Chen, in order to select true talents, assigned section-level officials in the bureau to review the examination papers in the meeting room during their spare time from 11:00 AM to 12:00 PM every day. He also invited the Jiangsu Supervisory Envoy to send personnel to the bureau to supervise and prevent private malpractice such as "solicitation". During the paper review, all section heads were not allowed to receive guests, nor were they allowed to take the examination papers out of the meeting room. After 12:00 PM, all the reviewed papers were sealed with fire lacquer by the supervisor. The section heads humorously called this one hour of time "a fixed-term imprisonment," which they deemed a great hardship.</p>
<h3>Interference with Nude Dancing in Martial Arts Performance: Assault on Landlord Affects Neighbors</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Zhao Xiaomao, a dancer living in Heng'anfang 35, Nanyang Bridge, Xizang South Road, often engages in nude dancing with dance patrons in her room, making her business thriving. At around 1:30 PM yesterday afternoon, the second landlord, Meng A'si, caught a glimpse of this and reprimanded her for being immoral, which led to an argument. Afterwards, Zhao became angry out of shame and gathered more than a dozen members of the "Bo Dao Gang" (Knife Gang). Meng happened to be chatting with a Wang family at No. 50 in the same neighborhood. Zhao led the thugs to Wang's house and beat Meng all over with sticks, causing serious injuries. Wang's wife, Zhu, was also beaten in the face and hands. In addition, two jars of Wang's aged wine and other furniture were destroyed. Furthermore, a set of white wool Western-style clothing, a fifty-type gold-plated Parker pen, and a Swiss pocket watch were all missing.

The police arrested the main offender, Zhao Xiaomao, and took her to the Nanyang Bridge police station of the Penglai police precinct for further investigation.</p>

We got married in Qishan, Sichuan, in April of the 34th year of the Republic of China. At that time, I didn't know that the defendant was already married. At the end of May, the defendant's younger brother and sister-in-law brought a boy, saying that he was the defendant's nephew. Only now do I know that he is his own flesh and blood." Zhou Liwen's biological mother, Zhou He, was summoned again. She stated: "One night, Chen Xiwu brought a man in military uniform to my house, saying that he had accidentally injured his foot.

<h3>President Chiang’s Summer Retreat in Moganshan</h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent for This Newspaper, Chu Yusheng</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Moganshan, This Newspaper, 27th] Moganshan, a summer resort located in the western part of Zhejiang Province, boasts lush bamboo forests and a tranquil environment. Through years of development by both Chinese and foreigners, it has grown to a considerable scale. During the war, it suffered from the impact of the conflict. After the war, the Zhejiang Provincial Government established a special bureau to manage it, hoping to attract Chinese and foreign visitors. This year, we have already reported in our articles that Moganshan is thriving and undergoing construction. At this moment, President Chiang's sudden visit to the mountain for a summer retreat has undoubtedly added immeasurable encouragement to Moganshan's development.</p>
<p>President Chiang made the decision to come to Moganshan on the 26th. Two months ago, there were rumors in Moganshan, and various preparations were being made, but these were just rumors. Unexpectedly, on the morning of the 26th, Madame Chiang flew from Shanghai to Nanjing. On the afternoon of the 26th, the President also received Commander-in-Chief Bai Chongxi. In the afternoon, he decided to fly to Hangzhou with his wife and then proceed to Moganshan.</p>
<p>Arrived Directly at Gengcun Without Rest</p>
<p>Beforehand, Chiang Ching-kuo and Yu Jishi arrived in Hangzhou, busily arranging the President's official residence. They also notified Wang Zhengyi, the director of the Moganshan Administration Bureau, to prepare immediately. Wang only learned about it around noon on the 26th and rushed up the mountain to prepare. During Chiang Ching-kuo's stay in Hangzhou, many friends asked him: "Is the Old Man coming?" He would only smile.</p>
<p>Director Yu feared that publicizing the news would prevent the President from having a peaceful rest. News reporters had already obtained clues around 1:00 PM that day. In the afternoon, there were many phone calls, and the relevant authorities were tight-lipped. It was confirmed that the President had arrived in Hangzhou by 5:00 PM. They did not rest in the prepared official residence but went directly to Gengcun, at the foot of Moganshan, arriving at 7:30 PM.</p>
<p>The Official Residence is Surrounded by Quiet Pine Forests</p>
<p>The Administration Bureau prepared sedan chairs, inviting the President and his wife to ascend the mountain. The sedan chairs were modeled after those on Lushan, carried by four people. It is said that the porters had also undergone training beforehand.</p>
<p>The President's residence is located at No. 550, Wulin Village, commonly known as No. 550, Ridge Top. The terrain there is high, and the buildings are not complicated, with only a few structures. The President's official residence belongs to Chen Yongqing, a director of the Shanghai Zhejiang Industrial Bank. The house has sanitary facilities, a reception room, and living quarters for servants. It is surrounded by neat pine forests, creating a quiet and secluded atmosphere. It truly embodies the saying: "Sitting quietly, one dislikes the noise of the flowing water; gazing leisurely, one finds fault with the busyness of the white clouds."</p>
<p>The President and his wife arrived on the mountain around 8:00 PM. Hangzhou Mayor Zhou Xiangxian and Chiang Ching-kuo accompanied them up the mountain. Because it was late, even Mayor Zhou's personal items, such as cigarettes and a lighter, were not delivered to the mountain.</p>
<p>Met Many People in the Mountains for Two Days</p>
<p>He has been on the mountain for two days. Besides meeting with Zhejiang Chairman Chen Yi, Pacification Director Tang Enbo, and Zhejiang Provincial Assembly Speaker Zhang Qiang, the rest of the time has been spent resting. He and his wife sometimes stroll near the official residence, sometimes walk down the mountain and wander along the mountain paths, and sometimes visit Sword Pond to see where Gan Jiang and Mo Ye forged their swords. Sometimes he sits quietly in the official residence, appearing quite leisurely and content.</p>
<p>On Moganshan, where "good flowers in every stream are like quiet maidens, and strange rocks on many peaks resemble flying immortals," although the mountain's grandeur and scale are smaller than those of Lushan, it possesses its own delicate and exquisite charm. This is President Chiang's third visit to Moganshan. The first was for Huang Fu's burial, and the second was also for a visit, but he only reached the entrance of Tasan Park before turning back. However, both of these trips were day trips, unlike this one, where he has stayed longer.</p>
<p>Electric Lights Replaced by Candles</p>
<p>The mountain originally had electric lights, but the equipment was removed after the war against Japan and has not been reinstalled. Therefore, gasoline lamps were used in the official residence, but the President found them to have a slight kerosene smell and switched to candles. Residents from near and far, both Chinese and foreign, have been waiting at various scenic spots every day, hoping to catch a glimpse of him. On the evening of the 27th, he was spotted by reporters while strolling on the road by the mountain. He frequently greeted us and asked, "Are you here to play? Are you having a good time?"</p>
<p>Prices on the mountain are similar to those in Hangzhou, but Gengcun is much more expensive. A plate of fried rice costs 800,000 yuan, and lodging for one person (without a proper room, just temporary accommodation) costs 1.5 million yuan. Hiring a car costs 1 million yuan.</p>
<p>Many Foreign Tourists on the Mountain</p>
<p>There are many foreigners on the mountain. Most of the women wear shorts and bras, and most of the men wear shorts and collared T-shirts. When they see the President, they stand at attention and salute.</p>
<p>The only financial institution on the mountain is the Zhejiang Commercial and Savings Bank, managed by Mr. Li Xiaowen, who is very friendly. The postal and telecommunications facilities are also well-established, managed by Mr. Wu Nanshi and three others. After the President arrived on the mountain, these four were extremely busy, but thanks to their hard work, telecommunications remained smooth and unimpeded.</p>
<p>According to sources, the President does not intend to stay long on the mountain, but seeing the continuous installation of telecommunications equipment and the gradual strengthening of security forces, whether he will stay longer is a question that news reporters are pursuing.</p>
<p>Cicadas all over the mountain are drumming their wings, diligently calling "Zhī liǎo, zhī liǎo, zhī liǎo" (I know, I know, I know), mixed with the tinkling sound of water washing down the streams, weaving a beautiful melody.</p>

<h3>One Woman Marries Two Men: Tragic Murder Case in Ningbo; Shu Huilin Arrested for Intoxicated Assault and False Reporting; Cao Shuangcai and Daughter Sent to Hospital for Emergency Treatment</h3>
<p>[Dispatch from Ningbo, This Newspaper, 29th] A shocking murder case involving 22 stabs occurred yesterday at No. 7, Shewei Alley, outside the South Gate.

Recently, Huilin returned home after losing his job and was enraged upon hearing the news. Yesterday, while drunk, he carried two newly purchased kitchen knives and rushed to Cao's house. Without explanation, he raised the knives and slashed at Shuangcai, causing blood to gush out like a tide. The younger daughter, Xiaomao, screamed in terror and was also knocked down by the slashes. Amao, in desperation, rushed out to call for help. Huilin then took the opportunity to escape to the police station, claiming that he had been injured by Cao's father and son. After questioning, the truth was revealed, and he was arrested. The Cao father and daughter were both sent to the hospital for emergency treatment, and their lives are still in danger.</p>
<h3>Dikes Collapsed in Thirteen Counties Along the Yangtze River in Anhui, Severe Disaster Situation</h3>
<p>[Airmail Dispatch from Anqing, This Newspaper, 28th] Sheng Decun of the Anhui Water Conservancy Bureau stated that the Yangtze River embankments in Anhui Province are divided into three sections: Huayang, Anqing, and Guichi. The First Repair and Defense Office oversees the four counties of Huayang, Susong, Wangjiang, and Dongzhi. The Second Repair and Defense Office oversees the four counties of Huaining, Tongcheng, Guichi, and Tongling. The Third Repair and Defense Office oversees the five counties of Wuwei, He County, Fanchang, Wuhu, and Dangtu. The above thirteen counties have a total of sixty-eight dikes, both large and small, along the Yangtze River, benefiting 1.2 million mu of farmland and with a total embankment length of over 1,000 li. The disaster situation in the first and second defense offices is particularly severe and tragic. He has reported to the Ministry of Social Affairs for urgent disaster relief. The affected farmland in various areas includes 3 million mu in Tongma Dike, 100,000 mu in Wangjiang Synthetic Dike, 1,000 mu in Hexing Dike, 10,000 mu in Dongxing Dike, 2,000 mu in Taishun Dike, 1,000 mu in Shunquan Dike, 6,000 mu in Dongzhi Yufeng Dike, 300 mu in Lansheng Dike, 2,000 mu in Yicheng Dike, 4,000 mu in Guichi Wanxing Dike, 2,000 mu in Minsheng Dike, 8,000 mu in Shangquan Cheng Dike, 5,000 mu in Datongyi Dike, and 1,000 mu in Fanchang Guangda Dike. The collapse situation can be roughly divided into: (1) Over 400,000 mu have been devastated by the collapse. (2) About 30% of the entire area, or over 3 million mu, have been flooded due to the inability of internal water to drain. (3) The farmland devastated by the collapse of inland river embankments and the inundated beaches along the Yangtze River is ten times greater than the above two categories. Various types of devastated farmland total approximately 450,000 mu. In the Susong area of Tongma Dike in Anhui, over 2,600 qing of farmland in 37 water villages have been submerged, affecting over 200,000 people, who are gathering in the county seat, desperately seeking relief.</p>
<p>Another report: From Waigouerkou in the west of the county to Guangji Bridge in the urban area, the water level is 4-5 chi high. The deepest parts, such as along Changtong'anmen Gulou, are about 6-7 chi. Over 100 houses and shops are submerged in water. Guangfeng Rice Mill and other businesses have mostly closed down on their own. Ferrying boats in the urban area are thriving. The evening smoke rises in wisps, and the sound of oars never ceases, like entering a desolate village inn. In recent days, people have been submerged by the water and have no means of livelihood. About a dozen women, the elderly, and children have died.</p>

<h3>Refusal to Vacate After Lease Expiration: Housing Dispute Goes to Court</h3>
<p>Mr. Wu asks: I have a house in Shanghai that I rented to a certain person. The lease expired in January of this year, but the tenant refuses to move out, leading to a court case. The court ruled that the defendant should move out within a certain number of months and granted provisional execution. I have several questions that I would appreciate answers to: (1) During the eviction period, can I still collect the rent as before? Can it be settled together during execution? (2) Provisional execution has been ruled, but it has not been executed yet. Can I apply to the court again? If I cannot provide a reliable shop guarantee, what should I do? (3) The sun deck in the house is damaged, and the defendant refuses to repair it, resulting in its collapse. Is the defendant liable for compensation? The lease states that "the tenant shall maintain the house in good condition and shall not allow others or themselves to damage it."</p>
<p>[Lawyer Jiang Fan answers] (1) The rent during the eviction period can of course be collected. If there is no mention of rent payment in the judgment, it cannot be enforced together. (2) If the judgment states that provisional execution is granted after providing a guarantee, it should be handled according to the judgment. (3) According to the law, the tenant can be required to compensate or restore the original condition.</p>

<h3>After Implementation of the New Law on Opening Up Self-Provided Foreign Exchange, the Quota System is Still Maintained; Detailed Implementation Rules are Being Approved by the Executive Yuan</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper] Huo Baoshu, Chairman of the Export-Import Control Commission, hosted a meeting with import and export merchants and the press at 4:00 PM yesterday on the fourth floor of the Bank of China to provide a detailed supplementary explanation of the measures for overseas Chinese capital and domestic funds investing in domestic production enterprises and to provide brief answers to various questions. Chairman Huo's full report is as follows:</p>
<p>"The Executive Yuan passed the measures for overseas Chinese capital and domestic funds investing in domestic production enterprises at its eighth meeting on the 21st of this month, and it has been announced in the newspapers. We can briefly explain the spirit of the measures:</p>
<p>(1) Supplementing Production Tools: Over the past ten years, domestic production enterprises have suffered repeated destruction and urgently need to be supplemented and restored. During the war, many domestic factories ordered machinery from abroad, which urgently needs to be imported at this time. Overseas Chinese who hope to invest in domestic production enterprises should be facilitated.</p>
<p>(2) Supplementing Production Raw Materials: Article 8 of these measures stipulates that overseas Chinese capital is allowed to bring back the main raw materials needed domestically. Please see the attached table for the list of raw materials. These raw materials are lacking domestically and are not included in US aid, while the places where overseas Chinese reside are the main production areas.</p>
<p>(3) Coordinating with Domestic Industrial Needs: The raw materials listed in the currently announced attached table are those that are extremely lacking domestically. In the future, the announcement will still be coordinated with industrial needs. Those that are sufficient domestically will not be imported, and those that are lacking will be supplemented.</p>
<p>(4) The Quota System is Still Maintained: The purpose of these measures is to supplement the shortage of industrial raw materials. Because domestic raw materials are extremely lacking, the quota system will still be maintained.</p>
<p>(5) Simple Procedures: These measures do not add any procedures for applicants other than preparing a plan and a business estimate. If the applicant cannot handle the import themselves, they can entrust it to a qualified importer.</p>
<p>(6) Careful Review: These applications will first be reviewed by the competent ministries and commissions within a time limit. After the competent ministries and commissions review them, they will be submitted to the Commission. The Commission will establish a special committee to review them carefully. However, the review time must be fast to ensure that applicants receive a response to their application within the shortest possible time. However, applicants must pay attention to preparing all the necessary documents in accordance with the regulations when submitting them to the ministries and commissions for review to avoid the delay in the review time due to official correspondence.</p>
<p>Attached Table: The raw materials allowed to be imported are limited to the following items: rice, wheat, flour, cotton, wool, ramie and burlap bags, ramie grass, raw rubber and tires, wood and sleepers, fertilizer, gasoline, diesel, lubricating oil, coal, coke, paper and pulp, coconut oil, and raw materials for special medicines.</p>
<h3>Supplementary Explanation</h3>
<p>After Huo's report, Chen Junren, Fang Yuanxian, Shen Zouting, and Huang Qinghua, the chiefs of the respective sections, continued to provide supplementary explanations on various technical issues, as follows:</p>
<p>(1) The raw materials and equipment purchased and transported back to China with domestic funds by Chinese citizens abroad can only be used for their own use and cannot be sold. This is the difference between them and overseas Chinese capital. In the future, the Export-Import Control Commission intends to join hands with relevant agencies to form an assessment committee to supervise the use of domestic funds returning to China after overseas funds return to China and prevent the illegal export of raw materials, etc.</p>
<p>(2) The one hundred and ten-odd kinds of raw materials and materials that are permitted to be imported under these measures are simple in nature, lacking domestically, and easy for overseas Chinese to purchase locally. Although materials such as hardware and chemicals are needed domestically, they are temporarily not allowed to be imported due to their complex nature.</p>
<p>(3) In the future, the procedures for overseas Chinese capital to apply for purchasing and transporting materials will be simplified and expedited. The review time for the competent ministries and commissions will not exceed two months, and the Export-Import Control Commission will establish a special team to handle this matter. Once the review is completed, a permit will be issued.</p>
<p>(4) There have been two opposing theories in the past as to whether to open up foreign exchange for self-provided items. The measures currently implemented enable factories to obtain the raw materials they need and, at the same time, avoid the drawbacks that may arise from opening up.</p>
<h3>Brief Answers</h3>
<p>After the chiefs of each section gave their explanations, import and export industries and news reporters asked questions, which were answered briefly by Chairman Huo himself. What he said of his vehicle is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>(1) The current measures can be used as a test. When the results are good, they can be slowly relaxed until they are fully opened. The government is concerned about the market after the opening of foreign exchange, so the current measures cannot but have considerable restrictions.</p>
<p>(2) Foreign merchants who have already established factories in China can handle them in accordance with these measures. As for newly arrived foreign capital, it will be handled separately.</p>
<p>(3) Whether funds from Hong Kong and Macao can be used as overseas Chinese capital is a matter on which the Executive Yuan has not given clear instructions. Since there is no need for passports for travel between the mainland and Hong Kong and Macao, and they cannot be regarded as foreign territories, the handling of funds from Hong Kong and Macao needs to be studied and determined after consultation with the industrial and trade sectors. After Huo's answer, Zhang Yaozhang and Hong Nianzu expressed their opinions from the perspectives of the import and export and industrial sectors. Huo agreed to study and consider them with people from both industries. The reception ended at 6:00 PM.</p>
<h3>Cotton Yarn Merchants Request the Cotton Yarn Committee to Improve the Yarn Throwing Method</h3>
<p>Difficulty in Obtaining Warehouse Receipts Causes Heavy Losses to Yarn Merchants</p>
<p>[This Newspaper] The Shanghai Cotton Yarn Industry Association has repeatedly received reports from its members that after paying for cotton yarn purchased from the China Textile Construction Corporation, there is often a delay of six or seven days in obtaining the warehouse receipts. The Association has previously sent a letter to the company requesting improvements. Recently, the situation has become even worse. For example, the yarn purchased on the 13th of this month has not yet been obtained warehouse receipt as of today, and the anticipation has lasted for half a month. It is said that yarn merchants purchase cotton yarn mostly for transportation to other ports and to supply practical needs such as the replication of handicrafts. Delays in receiving warehouse receipts delay shipping schedules and cause significant interest losses. Therefore, the Association sent another letter to the Textile Construction Corporation yesterday, requesting prompt improvements.</p>
<p>According to the Cotton Yarn Industry Association: In March of this year, when members of the Association purchased cotton yarn from the Textile Construction Corporation, they had to pay additional consolidated taxes when picking up the goods from each factory. The accumulated amount has been huge over the past few months. The Association has submitted a report to the Cotton Yarn Control Committee, requesting a refund. Although it was approved and instructed to collect it from the original factory, it has not yet been received.</p>
<p>Furthermore, from June 19th to the 30th of this year, the Cotton Yarn Control Committee threw over a thousand bales of yarn. The members of the Association purchased over seven hundred bales of 20-count Heavenly Maiden cotton yarn from the Textile Construction Corporation, with tax payments reaching over 20 billion yuan. The company is now forwarding this to the Cotton Yarn Control Committee and the Central Bank for reimbursement. The yarn merchants are eagerly awaiting an early resolution to avoid further losses.</p>
<p>It is also said that the Central Bank and the Textile Construction Corporation's delays in issuing warehouse receipts are related to the tightening of credit. However, the yarn merchants believe that they have suffered damage as a result and are appealing for relief, lest they be collateral damage.</p>
<p>Slightly Better Yarn Market</p>
<p>Yesterday's cotton yarn market saw a slight improvement due to the easing of credit. Buyers from Tianjin, Guangdong, and other regions were still active, and the local replication industry was also absorbing yarn, leading to a generally optimistic sentiment.</p>
<p>42-count Blue Phoenix fine yarn initially jumped by 100 million yuan at the opening. Midway, manufacturers, preparing to pay wages and arrange funds at the end of the month, sold goods in the market for cash, causing the market to fall back by a small amount of 70-80 million yuan. Finally, it closed at 1.88 billion yuan, up 80 million yuan from the previous day. Spot sales were also good, up 50 million yuan. 21-count Double Horse yarn saw recent purchases, with spot sales up 50 million yuan and next-day delivery up 40 million yuan. Other counts of coarse and fine yarn also saw increases ranging from 40 million to 70-80 million yuan. The total transaction volume for the day was only 58 bales.</p>
<p>Stable Cotton Cloth Market</p>
<p>Yesterday's cotton cloth market saw stable conditions. Due to the continued easing of credit and the frequent activity of spot yarn from the north in the market, 12-pound Dragon Head fine cloth initially jumped by 600,000 yuan at the opening. However, rumors of profit-taking spread, causing a decline in sentiment and prompting selling. Later, strong purchases from Guangdong, Hubei, and the north helped to push prices up, and the platform operators also took the opportunity to raise prices, turning sentiment bullish and pushing prices all the way up to a high of 54 million yuan. Near the close, prices faltered at high levels, and hearing that the yarn market was mediocre and that the buyers had stopped buying and started selling, scattered households sold off, causing the market to fall back to close at 53.6 million yuan, up 4.22 million yuan from the previous day. However, it was later heard that the Textile Construction Corporation had a large supply for sale, and off-market sales fell to 52 million yuan, weaker than the previous day. The markets for other grades of fine cloth and serge also remained strong. The total transaction volume for the day was 1,880 bolts.</p>
<p>[This Newspaper] According to the news group of the Cotton Yarn Control Committee, the dissolution of staff after the Cotton Yarn Control Committee is awaited to be abolished will be handled in accordance with central regulations. The staff also stated that they were not made any requests, contrary to rumors.</p>
<h3>The Bullish Momentum Fails to Last; Chinese Stock Market Conditions are Mediocre</h3>
<p>Yesterday, Chinese stocks experienced a surge in activity as speculative capital took advantage of the pre-foreign exchange opening environment. However, the increase was not sustainable. Qin Xing, Jing Lun, and two real estate stocks all briefly reached their limit-up prices, but this did not provide any significant stimulus, and most stocks exhibited a hesitant trend.</p>
<p>The morning started with mediocre performance, with stocks showing mixed results. Yongsha opened at a stable price of 11,450 yuan. Although it advanced to a high of 11,920 yuan through the efforts of numbers 169 and 134, it soon fell back to 11,570 yuan due to selling by numbers 102 and 143. Quanjing, Jing Lun, Lian Di, and Yongye all reached their limit-up prices, and numbers 169 and 176 were still eager to buy, pushing the price to 11,730 yuan. However, actual transactions were limited, and numbers 164 and 89 closed out their positions, causing the price to fall to 11,200 yuan near noon. Numbers 103 and 137 came in to buy, while numbers 99 and 154 made up the difference. The midday close was 11,280 yuan. Compared to the previous close, Yongye and Lian Di remained limit-up, Qin Xing and Jing Lun rebounded after reaching limit-up, and Innerwear rebounded after hitting limit-down, contracting by 10%. With the exception of Xinguang, Shangni, Yonggong, Lian'an, Zhongsi, Shangwu, Zhabei, and Xinhua, which each fell by 0.5%, the remaining stocks experienced only slight fluctuations.</p>
<p>In the afternoon session, although there were rumors of a capital increase for Yongsha, it opened slightly higher at 11,700 yuan. Number 26 sold down to 11,550 yuan, while numbers 129 and 76 continued to buy, and outside investors pushed the price up to 11,800 yuan. Numbers 228 and 51 sold off, causing the price to retreat to 11,480 yuan. State-owned banks performed poorly, and numbers 131 and 95 advanced to 11,700 yuan, while numbers 61 and 116 sold off, closing at 11,570 yuan. Compared to the morning close, Lian Di remained limit-up, Meiya Innerwear, Jing Lun, Yonggong, and Zhongfa rose by 0.5%, Zhabei, Shangwu, Huochai, Lian'an, and Tongyi remained stable, Zhongni experienced a slight setback, and the remaining stocks experienced slight gains. Over-the-counter stocks, especially those in the public utility, cultural, and banking sectors, were relatively weak, while the rest remained stable.</p>
<p>Government Bonds</p>
<p>The market opened lower and continued to decline. Unified C bonds opened at 96,000, but fell to 89,500 before stabilizing somewhat. Compared to the previous close, A and B bonds fell by 40,000 yuan, C and E bonds fell by 70,000 yuan, and D bonds fell by 50,000 yuan. Total trading volume was approximately 1.1 million.</p>

<h3>Amidst Cheers and Fanfares, the British King Declares the Opening of the World Games; 6,000 Athletes Parade, British Athlete Takes the Oath; Banners Flutter, Millions of Residents Cheer from the Sidewalks</h3>
<p>[This newspaper's dispatch] London, 29th: The 14th World Games opened Thursday afternoon amidst sharp fanfares. Thousands of spectators gathered in the vast stadium very early, and the weather was exceptionally hot.</p>
<p>[United Press, London, 29th] King George VI of England formally opened the 14th World Games on the 29th in a solemn and magnificent ceremony. Standing in the royal box, draped in blue cloth and adorned with royal gold emblems, the King solemnly declared: "I now announce to the public that the 1948 World Games have begun, marking the 14th World Games in modern times." Queen Elizabeth and Princess Margaret, dressed in navy blue, stood on either side. After 6,000 athletes paraded around the stadium, the King addressed the 75,000 spectators and athletes from various countries, announcing the opening of the World Games. The King and his entourage arrived at Wembley Imperial Stadium after a one-and-a-half-hour drive, where the British Organizing Committee stood respectfully at the entrance to greet them. The Chairman of the Organizing Committee, Lord Birdwood, stepped forward to lead the royal family into the royal box. During the procession, a canopy led the way, and spectators were not allowed to pass through the royal entrance until the King was seated. Led by a hundred buglers, the national teams of athletes marched in formation along World Games Avenue to Wembley. Millions of residents cheered from the sidewalks, and national flags fluttered in the breeze. The cheers were deafening as the largest contingent, the American team of 400 athletes, marched under the Stars and Stripes. The sun rose higher and shone brightly, and the temperature approached 100 degrees, breaking many years of records. The torch, which started in Greece, had traveled nearly 1,500 miles over 12 days to reach its destination. Spectators lined the streets to watch. The earliest spectators to arrive at Wembley were welcomed by the Grenadier Guards band. After the 6,000 athletes entered the stadium, they stood in formation and watched Finley, a British hurdler, take the oath on behalf of all the athletes. Then, Boy Scouts released thousands of carrier pigeons from their bags, following the ancient Greek custom of reporting the start of the World Games to the various nations. Finally, the last torchbearer emerged from a hidden passage and lit the torch inside the stadium, which will burn day and night until the closing ceremony. The first day's program was held on the evening of the 29th at Wembley Imperial Swimming Pool, with two water polo matches: Hungary vs. Egypt and Sweden vs. Switzerland. 50,000 tickets have already been sold for the swimming competitions. The authorities discovered that the program for the evening of the 29th was not full, so they added diving demonstrations and practice sessions.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 29th] At 10:30 PM on the 29th, this agency listened to a special broadcast in Chinese from London. The 14th World Games were solemnly opened at 3:30 PM (Greenwich Mean Time) on the 29th at Wembley Stadium in London, presided over by King George VI of England. The World Games torch, which had been relayed from southern Greece for 1,600 miles, arrived at the stadium just in time for the opening ceremony. Hundreds of thousands of men and women stayed up all night waiting around the stadium to witness the unveiling of this unprecedented event. Approximately 6,000 athletes participated. The Greek team led the parade into the stadium, followed by the British team at the rear. British Prime Minister Attlee welcomed the athletes participating in the World Games.</p>

The Olympic torch was lit on Mount Olympus in Greece and relayed by 1,717 runners from six countries, crossing the European continent and crossing the sea to London. There were originally 62 countries invited to the East, but Romania, Bulgaria, and Palestine did not send athletes, so only 59 countries actually participated. King George VI of England will open the Games. At that time, a 21-gun salute will be fired, and 5,000 athletes will march past the King. The opening program is scheduled as follows: (All times are Greenwich Mean Time, which is nine hours earlier than Shanghai time)</p>

<p>2:55 PM, the Chairman of the Organizing Committee, Birdwood, first addresses the athletes gathered in the arena, and then invites King George to declare the opening of the Games. 3:00 PM, the King declares the opening of the 14th World Games. 3:01 PM, the Games flag is slowly raised amidst fanfares. 3:02 PM, carrier pigeons are released. 3:05 PM, a 21-gun salute is fired. 3:07 PM, the relay runners carrying the torch arrive at the stadium and, after circling the stadium, light the Olympic torch.</p>
<h3>Chairman of the World Games Organizing Committee, Birdwood, Thanks Minister Zhu by Telegram</h3>
<p>[This newspaper's Nanjing, 29th] The Chairman of the 14th World Games Organizing Committee, Birdwood, recently sent a telegram to Minister Zhu of our Ministry of Education, stating briefly that he received the congratulatory telegram and all participants were deeply grateful. He expressed special thanks on behalf of the committee, and particularly welcomed the enthusiastic participation of the delegation from your country.</p>
<h3>Attlee Broadcasts a Welcome to the World Games Athletes</h3>
<p>[United Press, London, 28th] British Prime Minister Attlee on the 28th welcomed "6,000 young men and women, the world's best athletes" to Britain and expressed hope that the Olympic competitions would help "resist the negative consequences of war." In a broadcast address on the BBC, Attlee said: "Today's sports are truly international, and the public's love of sports creates friendships between men and women separated by space and lacking a common language. The World Games transcend all boundaries... Unlike other struggles, the general result of sports competitions is to increase friendship between the victor and the vanquished. Today's world must seize every opportunity to widely disseminate friendship between men and women of different nationalities, thereby increasing international understanding." Attlee extended "our warmest welcome" on behalf of the British people to visitors from abroad. He also said that he hoped the climate would be favorable for the competitions, and that although Britain has a shortage of housing and food, it has boundless goodwill.</p>
<h3>Torch Arrives at Dover, Suddenly Extinguished by a Gale</h3>
<p>[United Press, London, 28th] The Olympic torch, which was lit on July 17 at the ancient stadium in the Olympic Village in Greece, has arrived at Dover and will be relayed to London. This route will follow the muddy path that General Caesar's foreign troops marched on 2,000 years ago. When the World Games torch arrived at Dover, it was unexpectedly extinguished by a gale. Fortunately, the accompanying staff had a backup flame in the car, which was relit and continued its journey. The torch will run a little slower from the English Channel to Wimbledon, so that the torch will arrive on time at Wembley Stadium at 15:00 international time (midnight on the 30th Shanghai time) on the 30th when King George announces the opening of the 14th World Games.</p>
<h3>The United States Can Win the Overall Championship</h3>
<p>Swimming is the most promising</p>
<p>[United Press, London, 28th] On the eve of the opening of the 14th World Games, coaches and athletes from various countries are predicting that the United States will win the overall championship. However, they also warned that Sweden also has a chance of pulling off an upset. It is generally recognized that the United States is certain to win the men's track and field, men's swimming, basketball, rowing, and weightlifting championships, and also has hope in boxing and the modern pentathlon. According to the scoring rules for the overall championship, it is necessary to have first place in ten events, second place in five events, third place in four events, fourth place in three events, fifth place in two events, and sixth place in one event. If the United States achieves these results, it can win the overall championship.</p>
<p>[United Press, London, 28th] The United States has far stronger hopes of winning swimming and diving events in the World Games opening on the 29th than the other 34 countries. Reese, the American 100-meter swimmer, is in excellent condition and has a chance of achieving the first astonishing result since Weissmuller broke the short-distance swimming record 20 years ago. The French athlete, Scheni, the world record holder, appears uninspired and timid during practice. Observers by the pool believe that Scheni has "stage fright." Fando from Philadelphia is also a "promising talent," and he is confident of winning the 200-meter backstroke. The American 800-meter relay team also had a "good performance" on the evening of the 27th. The American athlete, McLean, is only 17 years old, and his performance has improved during practice, with a time of 2 minutes and 11 seconds.</p>

<h3>Private School Tuition Fees for the Next Semester: Director Li of the Education Bureau Speaks, Emphasizing In-Kind Standards</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Regarding the tuition fee standards for private primary and secondary schools in the city for the upcoming semester, various rumors are circulating. Director Li Ximou of the Education Bureau stated to reporters: "For the military celebration in Hangzhou and other places, tuition fees are standardized based on actual goods. To achieve a permanent solution, I personally advocate that tuition fees for private primary and secondary schools in our city should also be standardized based on actual goods." He believes that to run schools well, tuition fees should not be restricted. The financial affairs of private schools should be the responsibility of the board of directors. The reason why general private schools lack funding is because many board members hold only nominal positions. He considers it reasonable for the next semester's tuition standard to be equivalent to two *shi* of rice for senior and junior high schools, and one *shi* of rice for primary schools. If tuition is charged according to this standard, as long as the principal can absolutely ensure financial transparency and consider the welfare of teachers and staff, he believes that school expenses can be maintained. The Education Bureau has now instructed private primary and secondary schools to first discuss and formulate a standard, which will then be submitted to Mayor Wu for approval by the Education Bureau.</p>
<p>Jiang Jizhou's Statement</p>
<p>[Another Report] According to Jiang Jizhou, the person in charge of the Private Primary and Secondary School Federation in our city, who told reporters: "The standard for tuition fees for private primary and secondary schools for the next semester will need to be decided at a meeting in mid-August. Last semester, the highest tuition fee for senior high school was 4.8 million, the highest for junior high school was 3.84 million, and the highest for primary school was 2.4 million. At that time, the price of rice was 1.8 million per *shi*. The price of rice will also be considered when discussing tuition standards for this semester."</p>
<p>Suspension of Improvement Fees</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Director Li of the City Education Bureau stated yesterday: "The City School Improvement Fee will not be collected next semester. However, the repair fee will still be collected as appropriate because the city government's subsidy is small." The Education Bureau previously planned to add 200 National Education classes next semester, which has been approved by the Senate, but it is still questionable whether the city government will allocate funds.</p>
<p>Director Li stated: "The Education Bureau is currently working hard to raise funds for scholarships for impoverished students in our city for the next semester. The fundraising method is to have individuals or organizations, based on their ability, designate a scholarship for one or more impoverished students. In the past, after the scholarship funds were raised, they were centrally allocated to schools by a unified review committee, and there was no relationship between the donors and the recipients. Last semester, approximately 10,000 students from primary, secondary, and higher education institutions received scholarships. In the future, it is planned to allow donors and recipients to have direct contact, with recipients personally collecting the funds from the donors. At the end of the semester, the school will send the scholarship recipients' transcripts to the donors for their review."</p>

In addition, each school should admit 20% of students free of charge, and the Education Bureau should use this as a performance evaluation criterion. Furthermore, the city government's budget for the second half of the year, 1.7 trillion, has been approved by the review committee.</p>

<h3>Looking at Mr. Feng Zikai from the Perspective of Dentures</h3>
<p>— Xu Qinwen</p>
<p>Although we live on the shores of West Lake, I rarely see Mr. Feng Zikai because I am busy. Only when Zheng Dijun visits do I often hear some news about Mr. Feng from his mouth.</p>
<p>"Mr. Feng's teeth hurt again these past two days, so he hasn't been painting."</p>
<p>This is what I have heard many times. In the past, Mr. Feng adhered to the "three no's" principle: no teaching, no lecturing, no banquets. Of course, this was partly because he was busy painting, but not teaching was also half because he often had toothaches, making it inconvenient to talk much. Lecturing was the same because his teeth would hurt, making it inconvenient to talk much. And no banquets were because he was a vegetarian, not eating fish, shrimp, or meat, but also because his teeth were bad, making chewing inconvenient. So, the three no's principle was for only one reason: his bad teeth made chewing and talking difficult. This often made me sigh and think: If his teeth weren't bad, he could definitely produce more books that everyone loves. I remember Yuanqing saying to me that the good thing about Mr. Feng's teaching method was that it didn't make people feel like he was a teacher; it was like getting many good instructions in a conversation with relatives and friends. Such an excellent art educator, because of his bad teeth, actually adhered to the three no's principle, not teaching or lecturing; this is such a pity!</p>
<p>Last summer vacation, I had four molar roots extracted by Dr. Yi Zhaoxue, and my teeth on both sides were aligned, making chewing convenient and reducing illness. Dr. Yi's surgery is precise and the fees are low, and he is also amiable. I was very grateful and wrote "Supporting the Chin" to commemorate the event, and I asked Mr. Feng to write the last sentence "Never Forget After Every Meal" as a memento. My wife's painful tooth was caused by a rotated tooth root, which Dr. Yi extracted in two stages. Mr. Feng also knew about this. In conversation, Mr. Feng paid attention to our tooth extraction, and seemed quite interested. But I knew that for his teeth that were decayed, even if they were shaking very badly, he would not use artificial means to pull them out, always patiently waiting for them to fall out naturally. I understood the temperament of an artist who wouldn't shave his hair after his mother died, and thought it wasn't strange at all. But, relying on the warmth of friendship, I finally tried to persuade him to pull out the decayed tooth roots. We, as a couple, proved that Dr. Yi's tooth extraction did not feel painful, nor did it bleed much, and we talked about whether there was any danger.</p>
<p>"Extracting teeth," I said, "The only thing to fear is hemophilia; tooth extraction is originally not dangerous, but people with hemophilia bleed easily and it is difficult to stop, which is troublesome. So, as long as the first one extracted doesn't cause a problem, you don't have to be afraid of extracting any more later. The second is heart disease; because when injecting anesthesia, you need to add a bit of hemostatic medicine, and people with heart disease will get short of breath and can't stand it."</p>
<p>These words were heard from Dr. Yi; I was just turning on a broken record.</p>
<p>"I don't have heart disease, and I probably don't have hemophilia either." Mr. Feng said this, obviously already considering tooth extraction. When I told Dr. Yi about this, he considered it a difficult matter. The examination result was that seventeen tooth roots needed to be extracted before a full set of dentures could be fitted. I felt that this matter was very difficult, and I repeatedly indicated to Dr. Yi that, for the artistic Mr. Feng, he was used to letting things be natural and shouldn't be forced easily. However, unexpectedly, one day Dr. Yi came to see me, saying that Mr. Feng had already had tooth roots extracted twice, and the progress was good. He said that before Mr. Feng came to extract teeth, he first wrote me a letter, agreeing to come at a certain time on a certain day. When the day came for him to actually come and extract, he asked me, "Do you know why I had to write you a letter first?" I told him clearly that I didn't go out on Sunday afternoons, so he could come anytime; there was really no need to notify me in advance. But he explained that the purpose of writing this letter was not really to notify me, but to restrain himself. When he suddenly made the decision to extract the tooth roots, he was afraid that he would lack the courage to carry it out later, so he deliberately wrote this letter quickly, turning it into a kind of covenant, which he had to fulfill when the time came. Therefore, I knew that Mr. Feng was really a bit afraid of extracting teeth; but he values credibility and keeps his promises, so he finally came to extract according to the appointed time!</p>
<p>I was very touched; when I took the opportunity to visit Mr. Feng, he had already finished extracting the tooth roots. He said that sometimes he had them extracted for days in a row, and sometimes he had two or three extracted at once, shortening the scheduled time. "Only after pulling out the last tooth root did I feel a lightness in my shoulders!" Mr. Feng said triumphantly.</p>
<p>With no teeth in his mouth, I was afraid that eating would be inconvenient, so I inquired about how he was doing. He said, "Anyway, I don't eat hard things. I eat very quickly, and not much; this habit was developed when I was studying, in order to rush to play the piano."</p>
<p>This made me realize that the artistic profundity of Mr. Feng Zikai, who has distinctive characteristics in painting, music, literature, and calligraphy, is not accidental. Making a decision and seriously studying it is what allows one to succeed. Extracting seventeen tooth roots is just the most recent example. At first, I thought it would be difficult, which was not entirely an overestimation, but I thought that Mr. Feng had an artistic nature and loved to let things be natural, and I didn't know that he was also very capable of breaking free from nature and striving for progress.</p>
<p>Mr. Feng is also so frank; in his writing about extracting teeth, he always added "Brother" or "Mr." and other titles under my name; in the section where he wrote his impressions, he only wrote "Xu Qinwen." If he also added a title, that would be inconsistent with human nature; when thinking to himself, he wouldn't add a title to someone. But general hypocritical records would add many embellishments. He sent Dr. Yi a couplet, the first line "Skill Advances to the Divine," the second line "Man's Creation Surpasses Heaven's." When he had just had his dentures fitted, he said to me, "The first line is really right; Dr. Yi's skills are indeed good. After extracting the tooth roots, I only feel that the previous terror was completely unnecessary. But the second line is still a problem; after all, the fake ones are not as convenient as my own real teeth." If it's inconvenient for a long time, that's also a flaw in the technique. I thought he was just saying this to me; a few days later, I ran into Dr. Yi and mentioned this meaning, which shows that he had already expressed it to him as well. But after two or three months, the gums were firm, and after a series of adjustment procedures, he also got used to it. Mr. Feng then indicated to me that the second line was also correct. Soon, I heard the same meaning from Dr. Yi's mouth as well. — He expresses things as he feels them; being truthful to things and principles is the true nature of an artist. From extracting teeth, I felt more and more that Mr. Feng was able to preserve his true self and be worthy of respect.</p>
<h3>Heaven and Hell</h3>
<p>— Wu Yong</p>
<p>When relatives and friends meet today, 99 percent always start by complaining to each other and end by sighing in mutual sympathy. I, however, think that this may not be a bad phenomenon.</p>
<p>In fact, there are naturally also people who express their joy and excitement about the current situation. These belong to the 1 percent minority. These people are either watching the fire from the other side of the river, or fishing in troubled waters, or adding fuel to the fire; in short, they are people in the clouds. In addition, there are some who are originally people on the ground, but only want to get in touch with people in the clouds, so their words and expressions are full of praise for the current situation. These people are big children who have not been weaned, and cannot survive independently without a wet nurse until death. If the wet nurse says that the weather is a bit cold today, he will say: "It's simply like the North Pole." If someone proposes to issue million-yuan bills, he will immediately agree to issue ten million or one hundred million yuan bills. These people are nothing more than a bunch of "street performers" at heart, and always take "If I don't stay here, I'll find somewhere else" as their only creed for dealing with the world. These people's sense of right and wrong has long been extinguished, and their conscience has long been lost. They only see "steering according to the wind" as their ability. Listening to their words, at first glance, it seems to be beneficial to the authorities, but in fact, as soon as the wet nurse is used up, there will immediately be another kind of argument. The most misleading and the most useless are these people. We really cannot place any hope on these kinds of optimistic people in the clouds, or the quasi-cloud people who echo them.</p>
<p>On the contrary, those who complain are actually the ones who most desire the current situation to improve, that is, the ones who place the most hope in the government. Their angry words are enough to show their fervent expectations for the government.</p>
<p>However, "disappointment" often easily turns into "despair," leading to negativity and decadence. This is inevitably overcorrecting, just like forming two extremes with the people in the clouds, one in heaven and one in hell, disconnected from the world of people in the middle. We must know that the Earth has been condensed for about 2 billion years, and the history of human civilization on Earth is only 4,000 years at most. We must know that it has not yet been 2,400 years since mankind had Sakyamuni; it has not yet been 2,499 years since mankind had Confucius; it has not yet been 1,948 years since mankind had Jesus. Columbus' discovery of the New World was only a little more than 400 years ago; Copernicus first created the "heliocentric theory" in 1543, and Bruno and Galileo were only burned alive and sentenced to imprisonment for deeply believing in this theory. This seems ridiculous to today's people, but it was really only a little more than 400 years ago. Watt's invention of the steam engine, Hargreaves' invention of the spinning machine, Edison's invention of the electric light, and Marconi's invention of the wireless telegraph were all things that happened less than 200 years ago. In other words, these new things and new enjoyments were not known by my great-grandparents.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, the entire human race is really very intelligent and has a bright future. We must not forget that today's humans are still only half-human, half-animal. It is quite difficult to have achieved so much today. Today's chaos, today's war, when viewed from a distance, are nothing more than a small twist in the midst of a great evolutionary trend. Today's people's dissatisfaction with everything around them is precisely a sign that our ideal standards are rising. Therefore, although we are disappointed, we do not need to despair. We must know that we are not in heaven, nor are we in hell, but in the world of people.</p>
<h3>Gambling</h3>
<p>— Yi Jun</p>
<p>Smoking, drinking, prostitution, and gambling are either bad habits or improper entertainment. Fortunately, I am not interested in any of these four. The one I am comparatively a little interested in, the one I occasionally play a bit to have fun, is gambling, but my aversion to gambling even surpasses my aversion to prostitution.</p>
<p>Smoking can refresh the mind; drinking can forget worries; prostitution can release desires; what about gambling? I think it has a hundred harms and not a single benefit. Reasons:</p>
<p>First, gambling for money is ill-intentioned. A person who participates in gambling always wants to win other people's money, and will never try to lose. When gambling becomes intense, regardless of whether others are bankrupt, their families are broken, or their families are ruined, they will never give up the opportunity to win money. How is this different from the robber behavior of murdering and arson?</p>
<p>Second, gambling mostly leads to losing money. For ordinary gambling, the number of wins and losses depends on skill, but mainly on luck. Luck cannot be good every time, but it is very likely to be bad every time. Bad luck makes you lose; good luck wins, but the next time you encounter bad luck, you often lose not only what you won, but also your capital. People who lose money are always hot-tempered. The more they lose, the more fierce they become. The more fierce they become, the more they lose. When they are extremely angry, they often do not hesitate to stake everything on one throw, and end up bankrupt.</p>
<p>Third, the amount of effort, damage to health, and waste of time involved in gambling are simply unparalleled. Everyone's nerves are extremely tense every minute and every second, harboring great hope and fear before revealing the cards, and after revealing the cards, except for the winner, everyone else is full of disappointment and regret. In such a tense scene, one game follows another. When it gets dark, the electric lights are turned on. When the electric lights are turned off, candles are lit. The dark night passes, but they don't stop at dawn. The loss of time, energy, and health is unparalleled.</p>
<p>Fourth, some people use gambling as a means of socializing, a way to connect emotionally. But according to my observation, it is often counterproductive. A person who is usually generous often becomes extremely stingy on the gambling table, fighting for every penny. I have often seen even very good friends argue until their faces are red for the sake of a single pancake on the gambling table, sometimes "break up unhappily" for the sake of a single sentence, and sometimes stage a "full-scale martial arts fight" for a sesame-sized matter. There are endless such situations.</p>
<p>The disadvantages of gambling are certainly not limited to this, but these four major crimes alone are enough for me to shout, "Gambling is the source of all evils!"</p>
<h3>Jiangxi Siamese Twins: An Old Story</h3>
<p>— You Mo-jun</p>
<p>On July 20th, this newspaper's fifth page featured a Nanchang news dispatch stating that a pair of Siamese twins from Jiangxi, "Liu Shengjie and Liu Shengdi," were currently in Nanchang, exhibiting themselves for a ticket revenue of 150,000 yuan, and were planning to go to Shanghai to satisfy the viewing of the Shanghainese people. The "Ancient and Modern Wonders" column of the same newspaper also included a special illustration. On July 23rd, the fifth page of this newspaper again carried a news dispatch stating that the "Siamese twins" were going to Xun on the 22nd, to tour and exhibit in the Beijing-Shanghai area. During this hot summer, it is expected that this pair of "Siamese twins" will cause a sensation in Shanghai and become a topic of conversation.</p>
<p>According to records, this pair of "Siamese twins" has now come to Shanghai for the second time. Their first visit to Shanghai was in 1892, which was the 18th year of Emperor Guangxu of the Qing Dynasty, the Ren Chen year. This is recorded in Ye Juchang's "Notes from the Yandu Cottage," volume 6, entry for the 18th day of the fourth lunar month. The record states: "On the 18th, I took my child to see the strange children. The two children were born without navels. Instead, there was flesh connecting them at the navel, shaped like a 'yong' (甬), about three inches long, with exposed blue veins, and the skin color like a fleshy tumor. It is said that they were from Jiangxi. Note: 'yong' refers to the bell handle, see the Rites of Zhou." The newspaper's news dispatch also states: "The only connection between them is a fist-sized fleshy mass in the hypochondrium, which can sometimes stretch to about an inch, but this is not a frequent occurrence." By comparing Ye's record with the news dispatch, it is clear that the "Siamese twins" who have come to Shanghai now are undoubtedly the "strange children" seen by Ye Gong. The slight differences are that one account says the fleshy tumor grew at the navel, while the other says the fleshy mass grew in the hypochondrium. One says it was about three inches long, while the other says it could only stretch to about an inch, and even that was not a frequent occurrence. However, these are only minor discrepancies. As for the difference in the degree of stretching, it should have decreased with age, because when Ye Gong saw this pair of Siamese twins, they were only five years old.</p>
<p>The diary also records their actions: "When one drinks, both get drunk; when one eats, both cannot be fully satisfied; when one sits, both sit together; when one sleeps, both sleep together. When the two do something together, one uses the right hand and the other uses the left hand, their fingers and arms connected without any gap." This is corroborated by the news dispatch: "In terms of eating and drinking, if one drinks wine, the other will also get drunk... However, if one eats, they cannot both be full at the same time, and the way each person holds the chopsticks is also different. One uses the natural right hand, while the one on the left uses the left hand instead. Each uses the left or right hand to hold the bowl," which is also in complete agreement. This proves that the "strange children" recorded by Ye are the "Siamese twins" who have come to Shanghai now.</p>
<p>The public called them "strange children," saying, "The grandmother and father brought them... Their appearance is also handsome and of equal height." According to the news dispatch, this pair of strange children is now sixty-two years old. This time they revisit Shanghai, like Liu Lang returning after a long absence, they must be overwhelmed with feelings about the past and present!</p>
<h3>Idle Thoughts on a Rat Peeking into the Pavilion</h3>
<p>— Yu Shou</p>
<p>Beijing's Palace Architecture</p>
<p>If Beijing's palace architecture were to be described in detail, countless pages would be insufficient. In fact, within the Forbidden City, the residences of emperors and concubines are mostly large, plain houses, lacking any charm. Their beauty lies in the Three Seas, which were formerly the royal gardens. Among the Three Seas, Zhonghai is the most outstanding. The Listening to the Wild Geese Tower and the Washing Water Sounds pavilion are both masterpieces of their time.</p>
<p>During the Manchu Qing Dynasty, all architectural designs (including palaces and mausoleums) were handled by the "Construction Office" of the Imperial Household Department. These people were not architectural experts, but they each had secret books to rely on. They could accurately calculate the style of the project and the required materials. The arithmetic they used did not involve square roots or geometry, only the abacus. Why was this so? It is impossible to find out. The palace models currently displayed in the Meridian Gate Museum in Beijing are mostly old collections of the Construction Office, not all the work of the "Yangshi Lei" family. (The Construction Office was run by four major families, one of which was the father of the former court actor Wang Youchen.) As for the aforementioned secret books, some have already been taken to Japan, and only a few remaining copies are stored in the Summer Palace.</p>
<p>During the Beiyang government era, Zhu Guixin (Qiqian), although a corrupt official, was quite knowledgeable about ceremonial systems and cultural relics. The "Chinese Architectural Society" he founded collected a large number of drawings and models. After Guixin's death, who took over the possession of these materials is not known in detail, but it is likely that many have been scattered among the bookstores in Liulichang.</p>
<p>The beauty of Beijing's palace architecture is best appreciated from a high vantage point. The Wanchun Pavilion on Coal Hill and the summit of Jade Island in Beihai are both ideal locations. Looking down on the entire Forbidden City, the colors of azure and saffron are intertwined, inspiring a feeling of devout religious sentiment.</p>
