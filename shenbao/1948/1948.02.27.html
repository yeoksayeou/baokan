<h3>主席自牯返抵首都　今將親臨主持國務會議　政院通過華中總體戰政治經濟方略</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿六日電〕蔣主席僭夫人於廿六日由牯嶺轉潯，乘車機返京，座機於下午三時四十分，在九江十里舖機塲起飛，贛主席王陵基曾至機場送行。下午四時五十分，飛機抵京，兪濟時局長等一行隨返。由席今日衣長袍馬褂，手持扶杖；夫人着玄色大衣。下機後，面現怡然神色，旋即返官邸休息。據主席左右稱：主席在牯期間，於遊山之餘，曾閱讀宋元學案及曾文正公全集兩書，甚爲閒適。廿七日舉行之國務會議，將由主席主持。主席此次登山，歷十九日，適渡過農曆新歲，曾電召若干要員登山有所埀詢，外間對此頗多傳說，咸認爲主席山居，曾作重要會議，以研討國是；實則主席在名山勝境中，連日出遊，惟曾於冷靜中對全盤局勢。作縝密之檢討，並擬議未來之大計，在政治，經濟各部門，可能有所決定，俾澄清當前若干混亂現象。此項決定，將於最短之將來中逐一實施。</p>
<p>〔本報南京廿六日電〕政府對華中戰塲總體戰之政治·經濟，已作通盤之計劃，並已妥擬方略兩項，其中關於政治部份，分爲下列數點：（甲）建立保安城砦？（乙）强化地方組織；（丙）擴充地方武力（丁）爭取戰區壯丁。關於經濟部份，略分（甲）對鎖戰區物資，（乙）爭取戰區物資等項。此重要方略，經行政院廿六日臨時會議通過後，待國務會議通過，即將付諸實施。又聞其中曾有若干要點，如在作戰地區中發行糧票，搶購糧食，農民以糧票可至各地區兌購其他任何物資，與使用法幣相同。其次爲剿匪地區壯丁，一律編組爲自衛隊等項，均有詳細規定。</p>
<p>〔本報南京廿六日電〕行政院廿六日舉行臨時會議，張羣主持，會中除通過華中總體戰政治，經濟兩方略及第二期知識青年志願兵復員辦法外，尙有交付審査者兩案。（甲）外匯困難，各種國際會議本年度是否仍須參加案。（乙）銀行錢莊最低資本額及限制增設銀行錢莊地區案</p>
<p>〔本報南京廿六日電〕財部前爲配合經濟緊急措施方案，穩定各地金融市塲，對各地銀錢行莊之設立，曾一再通令予以限制，茲悉：財部頃並擬定銀行錢莊最低資本額及限制增設銀行，錢莊地區辦法，送政院核示，政院提廿六日例會中討論，尙未獲得通過，着財部再行擬議後，送政院審査，其要點在提高各行莊之資本額，如有限靑任之銀行，最抵資本額定爲二百億元，無限責任者，最低資本額定爲一百億元，錢莊减半，惟尙待財部擬議後，始克決定。</p>
<h3>政府決心平抑各地物價　造謠有據者依軍法懲處</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿六日電〕連日滬市謠諑紛傳，物價飛漲，市塲混亂不已，情形之嚴重，較去年二月金潮猶有過之，結果所致，南京及其他各地市塲均大受影響，平民生活更感痛苦，此種情形，已引起此間官方之重視，政府負責人士認爲，此次市塲情形混亂，金鈔·糧食·紗布·雜貨同時飛漲，顯係有奸商作祟，從中操縱，此種行爲與戡亂法令相牴觸，政府方面已決定即日派員趕滬秘察趨勢，對目前時局已成竹在胸，將有妥善決策。蔣主席今已由牯返京，處理國務。至東北間題，朝野人士莫不特別注意，現正研討根本屏決之策，最緊急之需要，爲運輸大軍前往增援，現亦開始。經濟方面，政府掌握糧食，紗布極爲充分，凡此種種，均不足以引起經濟混亂，現除探溯物價上漲原因外，尤將着重於謠言之散布，如獲有實據，決依軍法懲處，俾平物價，而儆效尤。據權威人士稱：此次物價狂漲，主要原因爲各種離奇謠言過多，如謂蔣主席如何，東北軍事如何，實則均無其事。蔣主席赴牯嶺小住，乘閒統籌全局，故吾人敢斷吾，物價狂漲，必爲奸商所操縱無疑，政府決予斷然措置，不稍寬貸。（各地物價情形刋二版左角）</p>
<h3>四項出口物資　生產改進計劃</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿六日電〕全經會廿六日下午三時舉行第卅五次例會，王雲五主席，首由秘書處報吿：（一）內匯匯率調整與限制携款至滬，穗兩地辦法。（二）銀樓業收兌金飾買賣條例第四條修正。（三）經濟改革方案增產物資部分實施辦法原方案。（四）審査修正，嗣由黄元彬報吿考察華南經濟情形，劉振東報吿山東經濟槪况及顧毓琅報吿一週來物價情形，旋討論政院交議農部擬訂之蠶絲·桐油·茶葉·羊毛四項出口物資生產改進計劃，該項計劃多係根據中美農業考察團之建議，決議重付審査，推定左舜生·陳啓天·張嘉璈·兪鴻鈞·王曉籟·何浩若·黄元彬·劉振東·霍寳樹等爲審査委員，由左舜生召集。生產改進計劃以三年爲日標，預計增產之計劃如下：（一）桐油第一年增產至六萬噸，第二年增至八萬噸，第三年增至十萬噸。（一）蠶絲預計三年內製造生絲六萬五千担，外銷綢緞八百萬碼。（三）茶蓋在在年內擬生產一百廿萬担。（四）羊毛希望每年生產製地毯之粗毛二億二千萬磅，細毛四億八千萬磅</p>
<p>〔本報南京廿六日電〕王曉籟廿六日在全經會發言，對近來上海米價狂漲，曾有所說明。王氏稱：滬米價上漲之原因固多，但最近對於米市塲之限制亦促成米價漲風之熾烈，如上海米市能恢復自由市塲，則米之漲勢富可稍趨緩和，惟會中對此問題並未正式討論，故無任何具體決定。</p>
<h3>我國出口物資</h3>
<p>仍需外輪協助運輸</p>
<p>〔本報南京廿六日電〕交部息：外傳我國出口物資將悉由國輪担任運輸事，頃據該部航政司負責人稱；航業界日前對此事曾有所表示，該部以國輪担任外運物資，在原則上極表贊同，但事關國際貿易，並無絕對禁止外輪承運之意，因我國出口物資日增，我國輪船有限，事實上仍需外輪協助。</p>
<h3>國省縣稅劃分　財部研訂辦法</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿六日電〕依照憲法規定，國稅與省稅。縣稅之劃分，由中央立法幷執行之，財部對行憲後之國說·省稅·縣稅劃分辦法草案，尙在縝密硏訂中，至目前各地財政之劃分，以行憲政府即將成立，在此過渡期間，仍照現行辦法辦理，不再變更。</p>

<h3>新民主力戰將展開　國軍援師源源開抵遼西　鄭洞國飛瀋范漢傑抵京</h3>
<p>〔本報瀋陽廿六日電〕新民序幕戰中，國軍頗得手。現匪正集中準備總攻，國軍亦有堅强佈置，主力戰即將展開，新民已面臨暴風雨前夕。匪取大包圍能勢，向新民及巨流河地區靠攏，一縱隊在瀋西巨流河東北地區，二縱隊在巨流河西北地區，六·七。九縱隊在新民巨流河東南地區，八縱隊在新民西南地區，多係主力。新民主力戰爆發前夕，南路營口及北路開原兩戰塲均已展開激戰，該兩戰塲匪雖較少，或可稱爲副戰塲，但匪企圖頗値重視。開原廿五日被匪四面包圍，守軍正盡最大努力。營口方面廿五日晚匪開始全而圍攻，情勢頗緊。又營口港現始大部解凍，某地艦隊救援，情勢可好辦。營口南郊及運河北岸，車若向飛機塲等處爲爭奪劇烈地帶，雙方砲火均猛烈，槍聲更密。</p>

<h3>運河綫匪攻勢粉碎　揚淮公路全打通　運河中涵洞閘板被匪完全破壞</h3>
<p>〔本報淮陰廿六日電〕（一）匪對運河綫之攻勢已完全粉碎，揚淮公路於昨午全部打通。國軍除在運堤東側掃蕩外，並趕修公路，短期內交通可望恢復。按此役匪以十一·十二兩縱隊精銳，企圖掩護四千餘傷兵移至洪澤湖休養，經國軍打擊，匪傷亡在兩千人以上。（二）據悉：有番號不明之匪兩團越運河西竄。（三）通楡綫北進國軍昨午後抵鹽城，並續向某方面挺進。（四）揚淮間電綫破壞甚劇，長達一二〇里。又淮徐間電綫亦被破壞，此間電信局朱鴻年局長已分派員工趕修。</p>
<p>〔本報鎭江廿六日電〕據官方公布：飛機數架，爲協助地而國軍掃蕩竄擾寳應境之殘匪，於昨下午兩次飛臨寳應上空，轟炸掃射集結匪軍，匪受創甚重。刻寳應城防守軍士氣旺盛，淮陰援軍亦已到達城郊，將與城內守軍合力聚殲殘匪。又殘匪此次竄擾運河綫淮安寳應附近各據點時，除燒殺淫掠外，並有計劃將揚淮公路節節破壞，且將沿運河自界首以北至淮安以南所有用以調節航運灌溉之涵洞閘板，完全抽去，致使運河水位突形低落。據交通界息：即使淮·寳間各地治安狀况即吿恢復，水陸交通亦須稍待。</p>
<h3>魯西南匪被包圍　豫國軍推進柘城</h3>
<p>〔本報兗州廿六日電〕向魯西南追剿之國軍廿五日收復臨淮集及董口後，殘餘之匪一部由考城竄東明，惟大部仍被國軍包圍於鄆城以北及黄河運河間三角地區</p>
<p>〔中央社開封廿六日電〕豫東國軍某部廿三日已推進柘城。</p>
<h3>「民盟」早已變質　絕非中立政團　吳鐵城指斥對「民盟」存幻想者</h3>
<p>〔中失社南京廿六日電〕記者爲「民盟」潛逃香港陰謀份子公開否認其總部解散令宣言，放棄中立路綫，參加共匪武裝叛亂及策動反政府與反美運動事，走訪吳鐵城，承發表談話稱：「民盟」在成立之初，由若干政團組成，當時多數負責人士確有政治抱負，且向政府貢獻意見作合法之政洽活動，惟自卅三年九月改組後，遂由中立之政團蛻化爲共黨之外圍，除政治主張上附和共黨外並接受其津貼。因此引起內部其他愛國份子之不滿而卒陷於分裂。去年十一月政府爲激底實施戡亂總動員，自不能容許「民盟」在雙方從事非法活動，乃明令應即停止活動。所幸「民盟」負責人均能遵守法令，宣佈自動解散，如黄炎培，張瀾，羅隆基與梁漱溟諸氏均先後放棄政治活動，重理舊業。此次基港集會之「民盟」不僅企圖葬灰復燃，而且暴露少數份子之本來面目。吾人細察其所謂三中全會之政治報吿與宣言，實完全與共匪一鼻孔出氣。余深信彼輩所標榜之反美與反政府武裝鬥爭，決難博得愛國人士之同情。余所不能理解者，若干國外人士至今仍謂「民盟」爲中立政團或稱之爲中間路綫，寄之以同情與希望，甚且幻想「民盟」及其他類似政團之發展所可有助於中國問題之解決，其缺乏政治識見洵可嘆也。</p>
<h3>董顯光談話</h3>
<p>章伯鈞等在港陰謀</p>
<p>以匪變相組織視之</p>
<p>〔本報南京廿六日電〕政院新聞局長董顯光，對民盟逃港份子依附共匪，公然宣稱參加叛亂一事，發表談話稱：「民主同盟」過去即有勾結共匪之事實，政府力加以取締，「民盟」中若干份子，自其總部負責人張瀾以下，如羅隆基，黄炎培，梁漱溟等，自去冬「民盟」自動宣布解散後，均照常留居國內各地，惟章伯鈞，沈鈞懦等潛赴香港，與共匪人員勾結，密謀恢復組織，參加共匪叛亂行動。章·沈等人此種伎倆，不僅暴露彼等歷年與共匪互相勾結，早有不可分之關係，且足證明今日彼等所號召之「民盟」實無異共匪匪之螟蛉子，無怪其標榜之叛國口號與共匪如出一轍，吾人對彼等陰謀組織及其秘密活動，自應以共匪變相組織之。</p>

<h3>議會與報紙</h3>
<p>— 邵永生</p>
<p>這幾天，上海市參議會正在召開第五次大會，筆者願乘此時討論一些議會與報紙的相互關係。</p>
<p>憲法實施後，如何使牠成爲「紙上的憲法」？民主政治制度實行後，如何使各級地方政府成爲一個個生氣蓬勃的政府？大衆不關切政治，如何引導他們關切？大衆對政治不感興趣，如何啓發他們的興趣？以上這些工作的責任，大部份首先要落在議會與報紙的肩上。</p>
<p>作爲一個中國的民選議員，應痛感自己當前的責任，實較世界任何先進民主國家的議員爲大。議員們應有捨棄一切私見而爲大衆服務的犧牲精神；尤其要排除以往議會所不免的腐敗作風，利用議會，控制官吏，以遂其私圖的作風。</p>
<p>在此民主政治啓蒙時期，對於引導民衆關切政治，啓蒙民衆對於政治感興趣，指示民衆對於切身利益作準確的辨別與認識：這種工作責任，大部份更落在報紙身上。</p>
<p>因爲報紙實在是推動這一工作的利器。這利器須用之於大衆有益的方面，而操持這利器的更應該是祗憑正義，毫無偏見，謹愼而公正的人。假如這宣傳利器，這民主政治的護法神，即報紙，不肯或不能盡牠應盡的職責，那麼中國的民主前途，就要顯得黯淡了。</p>
<p>上海市參議會，成立以來，巳一年有半，曾開過四次大會，議決不少案件，通過兩次預決算案，其成就可謂不少。但，默察一般市民，對於他們所選出的代表，所組成的議會，所進行的工作，所議案件的內容，以及有關市參議會一切動態等，大部份可說還是漠不關心。何以太部份上海市民，對於與他們休戚相關的市政設施，興革，和他們自身的義務與權利，如此不感興趣？</p>
<p>在回答這個問題，硏究其原因之前，我願引證美國司徒大使的話，作爲參考：去年年底司徒大使在燕京大學新聞學系大會中，發表「致中國人民書」，大使稱：「余曾指出中國之憲法現已實施，然若干人懷疑共是否能較紙上之憲法更能有效。余以爲此點當視中國人民之努力而定。雖則大部份人民因忙於日常生活；而無暇無與及此，然知識份子，非黨員，自由份子，以及新聞記者等，應起而保衛中國公民之權利與義務。單靠政府一方面，或單由政府主動，不能使憲法工作得有效而必需之改革。然通過言論·出版·及集會之自由，以及準確執行選舉，人民可以民主方法取得改革，政府中許多負責官員亦極希望有有效之改革也。」司徒大使以一個異國的代表，其關切愛護與期望中國，並不後於任何中國同胞。他曾表示過，他當他自己是一個中國人，他對中國的同情，可以當作一個中國的知己朋友。這樣一個知己友人所下的善意而眞誠的批評，應該受到我們大家的重視與反省吧。</p>
<p>由於司徒大使明智的論斷，筆者以一個民選的本市參議員的地位，來拿所經歷過的，與他的推斷相印證，更顯出他的理論是相當確實。</p>
<p>事實上，所謂黨員，非黨員，知識份子，自由份子，以及新聞記者，民選的議會裏面，上海市參議會裏面，這各色人等，都包括得有。要使憲法不成爲「紙上的憲法」，使民主政治下的各級地方政府成爲一個個生氣蓬勃的政府，要使每個市民對於政治感興趣，對於議會及議員們代表他們所做的工作表示關切，還要養成判別是非，以定取捨的能力，然後才能準確執行選舉，以達成協助監督政府，以謀全體市民福利的目的。這固然非一蹴可幾，目前這個推動工作的責任，却落在議會與報紙的肩上。並非因爲議會裏面包括得有黨員，非黨員，知識份子，自由份子，新聞記者等在內，同時，也因爲識會可以憲法所賦予人民的權利，集中發揮。而報紙更是促起人民注意，引導人民關切，啓發人民興趣，指示人民準確判斷的重要工具。</p>
<p>實際上，民主政治的推行，報紙所負的責任，以及所收的效果，要比議會大得多了。</p>
<p>要使政府有生氣，必須議會有生氣；要使議會有生氣，必須人民對議會和政治，有熟忱與興趣；要使人民有興趣，必賴於報紙的鼓勵與啓發。同時，議會政府雙方，更都有賴於報紙的督促。</p>
<p>上海市民對於代表他們執行權力，承諾義務的機關——市參議會，如果眞漠不關心，缺乏興趣，實非最佳現象，但這也許是民主啓蒙時代所不免的現象。我們硏究其原因，最好在過去事實中去檢討；實在說起來，議會本身與報紙，對於這現象的改善都是責無旁貸的。</p>
<p>過去的不必談，憲政實施以後，我們想想，提高市民對於議會政治的關切，興趣，與辨識這一點，報紙是否可以作點什麼工作？在此，筆者久久蘊蓄在心中的一個計劃，願拿牠來公開談一談。</p>
<p>筆者一每次看到市參議會開大會的時候，旁聽席上，人數寥寥，有時空得沒有人，這次現象比較進步，三天以來旁聽席上尙稱熟鬧。但無論如何，彷彿感覺到參議會將被市民遺棄了那樣的悲哀。參議員在台上辯論，發揮他們的見解，僅供給參議員們自己聽，此外祗新聞記者先生們都在聚精會神，振筆疾書。明天報上所看到的，或者因限於篇幅，或者因議案太多，故皆概略不詳。市民對於每個參議員對於每一個議案，所發揮的意見，正反兩面都不能得知當時辯諭的詳情，故無從由辯論到結論這過程中間去領略牠的重要性，以激發他們的注意關切和判斷。而且，每一議案有牠的特殊性質因素，亦非事先有個輪廓的際解不可，所以祗憑報紙一點點記載，也難怪市民們並不感到多大興趣。補救之道，應儘量利用無綫電播音，將人民代表們的聲音送入人民耳中。</p>
<p>現在參議會雖已有播音設備，由一家電台——新都電台（週波一三三〇）轉播，但是預備工作，尙嫌不够。因爲沒有得到報館合作，與報紙配合，恐怕市民們參議會播音的還是很少，（恐怕曉得參議會大會開會時有播音的也不參），而且在收聽的時候，很難找到頭緒，自然效果亦微。筆者以爲至少要做到下列辦法。</p>
<p>市參議會應將已經排定的議程，先一日在報上公佈，（議程排定以後，儘量避免臨時變更），其重要的議案，尤應加以簡單說明，使市民瞭解各議案內容的重要性，然後得選擇其關切而感興趣之議案，收聽屆時議員們的辯論情形及其結果。此外，轉播電台，亦當力求增多。主要的，還需報館的合作。筆者竭誠希望各報館當局對於利用無綫電報吿，也參加幷協助工作，一方面鼓勵市民收聽議會播音，一方而報館與議會及電台協商合作，派記者担任播音報吿，倣舞台播音報吿員的辦法。於每個重要議案開始討論之前，作一簡短之介紹，並於辭論終結後，報吿該一議案在辯論時之動態，趨勢，結果，及議塲空氣等，如以簡短生動之言辭描述當能引起聽衆市民極大興趣。更於公共處所或報館門前裝置臨時播音器，以便不備收音機的市民得以聆聽。這是一個訓練民衆關心政治的活動課程，每一報館都値得利用也極應該利川的啊！相信記者先生們，對於這一種推動民主政治的偉大而有意義的工作，也必感覺興趣而極願效力的。這等於活動報紙，記者以口代筆。議員們所發議論，直接送入市民的耳中，市民將不自覺地感覺市政之重要與其本身之關係，而增加其關切之程度與興趣；夫然後到下屆選舉，市民必將珍重其一票，不致隨便放棄與輕視選舉，對於所謂提倡好人政治終該多少有點帮助。公理正義的呼聲，歪曲阿私的論調，是是非非經過幾十萬或幾百萬人的心中忖度，腦中思量，口中宣述，人民與報紙，步調一致，公道自在人心，夫然後顯出與論眞正的價値，眞正的權威！</p>
<p>議員們也必然的要殫精竭慮，更爲大多數人民的利益着想，而發揮精粹的言論，議塲情緒必較過去更爲熱烈，議會精神必較過去更多精彩，而無聊的言論和無聊的捉案倒反可以减少。至於想利用議會勢力來控制官吏以遂私圖的人，現在固然不應有，以後恐也不會有，至低限度將要有所顧忌了。</p>
<p>筆者所以一再反覆陳說，實因爲我國民主方在啓蒙時代，在一開始的時候，人民議員都應有良好習慣，樹立良好風尙。何况上海物質條件，够得上這樣做，並不需要多的費用，其效果收穫却有計算不出的豐大。市參議會原有的播音方法是不够的，市民知道的並不多，事先亦不在報上公佈議程討論日時和電合週波等，廣播電台祇一家也太少，而且沒有報吿員作說明（這是最關重要的一點）。所以議會播音而沒有報館參加，報紙的配合，其效果是不大的，還不能多多引起人民的注意。希望筆者這篇淺薄的文字能引起各報館當局的注意，並熱烈盼望各報館聯合起來主辦此事。</p>
<p>此舉必須要在議會政府二者以外第三者來督促，來舉辦，除了這宣傳利器民主政治的護法神——報紙——來担任這工作而外，還有誰更比牠適合？</p>

<p>蘇州縣府放棄限價</p>
<p>〔本報南京廿六日電〕滬市塲物價漲風傳抵首都，即在京市塲造成更大之波瀾，京市物價連日騰漲，廿六日更創最高峯，達空前紀錄，且多日易數價，形成混亂狀態，其中以金鈔，糧食，紗布，雜貨爲最甚，黑市金價一跳再跳，各銀樓祗收不售，成半休息狀態，糧市議價今晨提升每担三十萬元，洋上熟每担二八〇萬，黑上熟二七〇萬，黄熟米二五〇萬，上熟米二四〇萬，麵粉每袋一三三萬，棉布喊價不一，惟成交淸淡，各貨上漲十萬廿萬至五十萬六十萬不等，五洋雜貨勇往前進，紙烟，火柴，肥皂，洋油，無不狂漲。</p>

<h3>捷共政變威脅人民自由　美英法嚴辭譴責　美可能對捷施經濟制裁</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕紐約廿六日廣播：華盛頓訊，美英法三國發表聲明，指責共產黨在捷克境內所造成之政變，係在成立「偽裝之獨裁」威脅自由之原則之存在，結果對於捷克人民將有極惡劣之影響。三强之聲明係由美國所發動，在過去廿四小時中與英法會商後，正式予以公佈。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社華盛頓廿六日電〕據此間消息靈通方面稱，美國務部將向捷克戈德華政府提出嚴峻抗議之照會。據該消息暗示，美可能對捷克採取經濟制裁。</p>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓廿五日電〕政府消息靈通方面稱：由於共黨在捷克攫權，美國可能再削减對捷克之信用放款，或將停止對捷克之輸出，特別爲機械。美官方相信美可能不政與捷克斷絕外交關係，蓋欲在普拉格維持一「鐵幕之窗」也。</p>
<p>〔中央社紐約廿五日電〕共黨在捷克奪得政權後，大多數美國人民對於勇敢而悲鬱之捷克人民，至寄同情。由於美國內約有捷克後裔之美人一百萬人，且捷克共和國係於上次大戰後在美國誕生之故，此間對於捷克新發展之報道極為重視。</p>
<p>〔路透社倫敦廿五日電〕此間政界人士指稱，捷克新內閣雖仍爲聯合內閣，然各重要職位已爲共黨所一手包辦。下月舉行之普選，可以作爲有效的考騐，以證此次聯合內閣是否僅有其表。此間並料共黨或將援匈波之例，以政府集團爲基礎，提出一個候選人名單。今捷克國內安全巳悉在共黨控制之下，內政司法兩部皆爲共黨所佔，故於審判所謂政變陰謀案犯之際，亦均將由共黨人担任審判長矣。</p>
<h3>捷共黨掌握政權　全國各地厲行整肅運動</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕倫敦廿六日廣播：捷克广城訊，高級官方人士謂，貝奈斯總統之所以向共產黨低頭，乃因避免流血之故。總統可能辭職或逃亡國外，以表明其立塲。據傳，貝氏刻正患病中，良以在應付內閣危機期間，情緒緊張，使其不能支持。</p>
<p>〔路透社普拉格廿六日電〕普拉格今日殊安靜，一般人士僉認賡續一週之政治危機已告結束，而共黨業已取得完全的勝利，全市國旗飄揚，民衆則歡舞慶祝，以示工人之擁護新政權。</p>
<p>〔合衆社普拉格廿六日電〕捷克共黨新政權之第一日，對各部各組織厲行整肅運動，運輸部被肅淸者十四人，郵電部中七人以上，國內商業部十五人，以及敎育部若干人。整肅並不限於政府之各部，此外各區各市之議會政黨，社會團體，國營企業與工廠中，亦均實行整肅。</p>
<p>〔路透社普拉格廿五日電〕戈德華宣布之新內閣，在閣員廿四人中，共黨佔有十二人，支特共黨之社會民主黨亦佔有四席，故共黨在新閣中已具絕對多數之控制權。共黨在具有三百席議員之國會中，佔有一百十四席，另加支持共黨之社會民主黨卅九席，可使彼等在國會中穩獲多數。</p>

<h3>英軍司令發表　遠東職役報告</h3>

<p>〔聯合社成功湖廿五日電〕挪威代表莫芬今日在聯合國小型大會提議召開聯合國大會特別會議，重新討論朝鮮問題，據稱聯合國機構如果不顧蘇聯反對遽而執行朝鮮問題決議案，或將造成與巴勒斯坦相似之局面。小型大會現定明日繼續開會，對於美國所提訓令駐朝鮮代表團盡力辦理選舉一案未付表決。菲律賓，印度，多米尼加，荷蘭，英國，暹羅，法國及烏拉圭等均贊成美國提案。莫氏並稱，「美蘇兩國之一如果撤退其佔領軍，朝鮮或將發生內戰，而使聯合國機構面臨應否派兵維持治安問題。爲求圓滿解決朝鮮問題計，必須設法敦促美蘇兩國成立協議，但欲成立此種協議，吾人實有考慮是否値得召開大會特別會議之必要」。小型大會休會前，菲律賓代表羅莫洛主張釋放朝鮮政治犯，俾在自由空氣下辦理選舉。</p>

<h3>赫爾回憶録（三）（三）</h3>
<p>— 北美報業聯合會版權所有　本報編譯室</p>
<p>請為盟軍在柏林會師乾杯</p>
<p>在會晤史達林之後，繼即舉行會議，在會議的休息時間，我硬和莫洛托夫談話，並且重申我曾向史達林提出的有關三國首長在巴斯拉會晤的論據。莫洛托夫問我在我所說的國際合作的計劃中，什麽應該在現在加以解決的。我把許多建議重新向他說了一遍，這些建議，自從我到莫斯科已經向他說過不止一次了。</p>
<p>莫洛托夫說，關於這些計劃，應該獲到一個協議。在想了一想之後，他突然說：</p>
<p>「孤立幾乎已經是貴國丢棄的東西，是不是，國務卿先生？」</p>
<p>我回答說，「是，的確如此。而且孤立幾乎已經是貴國丢棄的東西，是不是，部長先生？」</p>
<p>莫洛托夫微笑，並且承認的確如此。</p>
<p>我說，「在戰爭之後，假如你希望的話，你能够遵循孤立主義，並且吞取你的鄰人。但是你將丢棄這種辦法。當我年輕的時候，我知道田納西的一個暴漢。他時常以暴漢的身份去强硬對付別人，獲得一些東西，但是結果在世界上竟沒有一個朋友。」</p>
<p>十月二十八日，總統通知我他預料不久將前往北非，勢須於十一月九日離開華盛頓。（這是爲了出席在開羅舉行的羅斯福——邱吉爾——蔣介右會議）。他說他希望我保特我原來的計劃，就是在十一月七日返抵本國，因爲在他離開之前，他和我務必談過一番。</p>
<p>他建議說，假如史達林認爲無法和他會晤，大元帥至少應該飛到巴斯拉這樣遠的地方一天。這是極端重要的。在其餘的時間，總統希望史達林能够讓莫洛托夫來出席，同邱吉爾和他舉行會議。</p>
<p>翌日，我答覆總統說，我留在莫斯科的時間較預料者爲長，並且樂於在大西洋的東岸和他會晤。我說史達林大致不會到比德黑蘭更遠的地方，這種徵象，愈來愈顯著，並且我懷疑莫洛托夫是否會被派代替出席，因爲他並不是軍人。</p>
<p>兩天之後，我被迪打電報給總統說，在赴莫斯科途中，我們一批人中已有四人患惡性瘧疾，不能回來，所以我認爲不宜到北非來等他，把自己暴露於瘧疾，痢疾以及類似的疾病之前，因爲我並沒有受免疫注射。總統同意轉緩行期，而在美國和我會晤。於是我再打電報說，我將經甫太平洋飛返美國，不趁巡洋艦。</p>
<p>克列姆林宮的凱塞林女皇廳，是會議的最後一天——十月三十日夜——史達林大元帥設宴招待代表團的塲所。這是我出席會議以來第一次的社交工作。</p>
<p>在一到莫斯科之後，我就對莫洛托夫說，鑒於我的健康情形，我不能對社交活動和工作同時顧及。起初，他似乎並不相信我，不斷邀請我去觀劇和出席宴會，當我堅決表示拒絕之後，他似乎頗爲感動。後來有人吿訴我說，這一點使他相信我目的之認眞，因爲在我健康情形並不良好的情形之下，依然長途跋涉到莫斯科來，以謀有助於奠定較好的戰後世界的基礎。</p>
<p>我坐在史達林的右邊。這使我在進餐和餘興的一段長時間中，獲得和他談話的極好機會。我儘量利用它，以謀討論我們目前和將來的關係，深知道一次是我離開莫斯科前最後一個機會了。我多少用一種兜圈子的方法，逗引他發表意見。</p>
<p>史達林的心境極好。不管討論什麽題目，他似乎面而顧到，設法使我更明瞭他的目前的以及未來的立塲。在開始談話時，他說，「你獲得了一次成功的會議」。我立即回答說一切應歸功於州他，並且說他已核准他的偉大國家採取決定性的步驟，會同英國和美國來參加一個建立在合作基礎上的世界計劃。這一點似乎使他頗爲欣喜。在整個談話中，他表示無條件贊成廣泛的國際合作，軍事，政治和經濟都在其內，以謀和平。</p>
<p>我於是用儘量有力的方法，向史達林提出各點，說明需要他參與總統和首相之間個人的合作與領導。但是對於在巴斯拉和他們會晤這一點，他却肯定地說出了他的結論，就是說他目前不能離開他緊張的軍事局勢。他說我們應該相信他對于這一點是很誠懇的。</p>
<p>於是他說他可以派莫洛托夫代替他，因爲在蘇聯的法律之下，他在政府中實在是第二位人物，在他自己缺席的時候，可以代替他的位置。他問我對于這個觀念，意見如何。</p>
<p>我立即回答說，當然，假如他覺得絕對不能去，那麽莫洛托夫是一個很好的代表。但是在總統和我自己的思想中，全要的一點就是：假如史達林自已能够去，對於全世界將有深遠的心理影響。我說假如可能的話，我還是懇請他自己去。</p>
<p>對於這一點我沒有獲得什麼結果。他的結論似乎是決定的。我猜想他已經和他的顧問談論過，他們覺得軍事局勢，或者會議的需要，尙沒有到可以讓他離開的時光。我決定不再就此點催迫他，因爲還樣做法非惟無益，反足以損害我們的目的。</p>
<p>可是繼而，他却發表了一個絕頂重要的聲明。他淸楚而毫不含糊地說，當盟國擊敗德國之時，蘇聯將參與擊潰日本，這使我驚喜非常。</p>
<p>史達林提出這個題目，完全是出於自己的意思，雖然他腦筋中可能記得我曾和李維諾夫大使就此一題目所作的談話。他最後說我可以把這一點極機密地通知羅斯福總統。我衷心向他表示感謝。</p>
<p>大元帥說明他的決心，是很爽直的。他說得很有力，完全不是出諸人家的懇求，並且他並不要求任何答謝。</p>
<p>在一九四三年的雅爾達會議中，史達林用書面方式向總統提供同樣的諾言，但是當時乃是總統同意在亞洲方面對蘇聯作許多領土讓步之後，包括千島列島和庫頁島的一部份在內。我在一九四四年十一月已經辭職，所以不知道什麽局勢上的改變可能使這些讓步成爲必要——但是當史達林向我提供諾言要我向總統轉達的時候，是一點也不拖泥帶水的。</p>
<p>在進餐的時候，曾屢屢舉旗致意。史達林和我飲的是紅酒，而許多客人則喜歡飲伏特加酒。我們駐莫斯科軍事參贊堤恩少將爲大衆所注目。當他答謝史達林爲美國武裝部隊而乾杯時，他建議爲英美軍隊和蘇聯軍隊在柏林會師之日乾杯。史達林從我旁邊的椅于中立起來，繞過桌子去和他碰杯，這是唯有堤恩一人所獲的殊榮。</p>
<p>當我們離開餐桌的時候，在到另一個房間中去看電影之前，史達林領我和其他二三個人到隔壁一個房間中去幾分鐘。他開始自發地用最諷刺的口吻，講到以前所流傳的有關蘇聯和德國可能單獨媾和的傳說。我說凡是瞭解蘇聯人民以及在這一次戰爭中他們對德國的關係的，都知道他們不會和總國單獨媾和。對於這一點，他衷心加以首肯。</p>
<p>我們的主人於是領我們去看電影，其中描寫在一九一八年革命期間紅軍游擊隊為反抗背信的日本人而在西比利亞進行的艱苦戰鬥。這張影片是在一九三八年攝製的，當它在莫斯科公開放映時，曾引起日本大使的强硬抗議。現在對於選擇這張影片的目的，並無加以隱藏的嘗試，而在史達林剛對我講過蘇聯將參與對日戰爭之後放映，尤具雙重的意味。</p>
<p>電影之後再來一個音樂會，我一直到究了才離開，時間已是早晨二時左右——雖然我們巳定於淸晨五時起飛返國了。這次音樂會，是由最有名的蘇聯音樂家演奏的，史達林對於我自始至終留在那裏，似乎頗爲欣喜。</p>
<p>當我們吿別的時候，我從史達林那裏得到一個深刻的印象。在說了一番通常的吿別的說話之後，他和我握手並且用俄文說了一聲「再會」於是他從我那裏走開了三四步之後，突然回過頭再走回來，和我第二次握手，時間相當長，但是沒有說一句話。我自己心裏想，任何一個美國人能有史達林的人格和待人接物的方法，在我自己的國家中，也很可以達到很高的職位。</p>
<p>在我回到大使館之後，我發給總統兩個電報。我對於史達林吿訴我的有關日本的決心，認爲是如此機密，所以我一半用海軍秘碼發給總統，另一半用陸軍密碼發給總統。因爲我相信英國外交部有時候更容易透露出重要消息，比我認爲是應該的，我就讓總統自己去把這個消息傳達給邱吉爾。</p>
<p>關於計劃中的羅史邱會議，我通知總統說，史達林在言行上顯然是百分之一百贊成國際間在每一方面合作的這種新動向，這種合作在四國宣言中已予以表明，但是同時，他對於在德黑蘭之外和總統與首相會晤一點，目下不願退讓。由於總統與史達林之間的僵局繼續存在之故，我意思更想使羅斯福先生的思想更贊成一點德黑蘭，因爲我相信史達林是不會到巴斯拉去的。在經過相當考慮之後，總統表示同意了。</p>
<p>當我乘坐飛機返國之際，我深深覺得在莫斯科已獲得重大的成就。我們已經同意成立一個國際機構，這在後來就成爲聯合國。蘇聯同意成爲該機構的一員，並與西方國家在其他許多方面密切合作。我們在對義大利和對奧地利的政策方面，獲得了協議。我們已經成立了歐洲顧問委員會和義大利顧問委員會。我們已經就戰後處置德國的辦法，對法國的態度以及戰後應該遵循的經濟政策，交換了許多意見。此外，在會議之外，史達林還同意一點，就是一俟希特勒被擊潰，蘇聯將參加對日戰爭。</p>
<p>再者，蘇聯在目前對於解決戰後疆界問題，從來沒有提起過一次，而這個問題，在上一年曾頗使我們困惑的。</p>
<p>我們經德黑蘭，開羅，即爾傑爾，瑪拉克希，達加，福泰萊柴（巴西）和布托里科飛返本國，沿途並無意外。當我們接近巴西的時候，我們碰到了一個熱帶氣流，經過了二小時極難堪的飛行，致使我們中間若干人頗爲狼狽，但是對我似乎並無影響。在各處停留下來的時候我總和總統交換電報，並且很高興地獲悉他已決定和史達林在德黑蘭會晤了。</p>
<p>當我們在十一月十日抵達華盛頓機場的時候，總統在那裏歡迎我們。同他在一起的，還有一個國會代表團。</p>
<p>在我們赴白宮途中以及在翌晨的談話中，我向總統叙述莫斯科會議的要事。他對於討論即將舉行的開羅和德黑蘭會議，更發生興趣。他彷彿用一個小孩子的熟情，期待着和史達林會晤，並且特別懇切地要我說出對於大元帥的個人印象。幾小時之後，總統就啓程赴這兩個歷史性會議了。</p>

<p>金管局長談話</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕本市金融管理局局長李立俠，昨日下午六時，在中央銀行向新聞界發表談話如次：最近本市金鈔黑市，又呈波動，揆厥原因：計有：（一）由於日用必需品如食米紗布之暴漲。（二）電匯一再暴　，顯示本市資金逃港，且本市有人經常套做港匯。據本局調査所得，本市經營港匯之機構頗多，類似廣州之民　局，大多利用公司行號名稱，作爲依附，私設電台，日常對往來交易，行市漲跌，均用暗號傳遞，與港方相聯繫。該批經營黑市港匯之行號及人員，中央銀行早經長期調査，迨金管局成立後，更予密切注意，根據暗號搜素，對往來電訊分別截留；耙錄在卷。茲已査出其中規模最宏，經營最大之四十餘家，開具詳細名單，地址，電話號碼等，送陳市警察局，於今日（二十六日）起，根據作全面之搜査。最近滬市物價波動，就金融之立塲言，實爲資金及現鈔匯流上海之後果。按往常本市在國曆及農曆新年年關前後，物價不免均有波動，此緣：（一）軍政機關提款較多。（二）工商匯款趨多。國行對資金匯滬一點，刻正密切注意，設法覓具資金之出路。最近十日來，國行逐日平均差入銀根三千億元，故銀根趨緊，此於穩定物價，不無帮助，惟最近物價之波動，屬於週期性者較多，此一週期性過後，物價又可重趨於　定云。</p>
<p>十餘證券號令停業</p>
<p>〔又訊〕交易所監理員辦公處特派員業經分就四川路江西路中央路等及各大樓査獲非法字號達三十餘家之多，已由該處函請警局分別勒令停業，其中有十餘家有違反交易所法罪嫌，經移地檢處訊辦，按交易所法第五十三條之規定，可處買賣者一年以下之徒刑。</p>
<h3>吳局長向參議會大聲疾呼　兩大危機快想辦法　多數工廠將無法維持　難民不救治安成問題</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕市參議會五次大會第四次會議，於昨日下午召開，首先舉行前日會議未完事項工務局趙局長答覆質詢，質詢公用局及趙局長答覆。然後開始第四次會議議程，由民政·警政·社會等局長工作報吿，區長及區民代表大會二代表出席報吿。至民·警·社三局質詢與答覆，須延至下週一（三月一日）始可繼續。今明兩日上午九至十二時，下午二至六時均爲各組審審査會議。</p>
<p>昨日大會上，社會局長吳開先報吿施政時，除將主要各點說明外，並大聲疾呼，提出當前兩大嚴重問題，促參議會注意：（一）因物價彼動，本年許多工廠勢將無法支持，工人失業，此實爲最最焦慮之事。（二）收容所難民現有五千餘人，受救濟者又有數萬人，冬令救濟會規定四月十五日結束，但視情形決不能結束。蓋上海數十萬難民，如不設法縱續救濟，治安勢必發生問題。吳局長特別强調此兩大危機之嚴重性，要求參議會趕快想一解決辦法。</p>
<p>共施政報吿：（一）糧食行政，去年米價波動至十二月份突飛猛進，實出意外，因此時新設登塲，照理不應跳動，其最大原因乃因軍米不够。後經向糧食部要求停購軍米，但漲高後即不易下落。以前每次波動，均以拋米抑平。但今年性質不同，產米區價格高，故拋米後所得效果不多。至本年全面配售辦法，即由美援華會供給米一半糧食部與本市市政府各負擔四分之一，如此，每人每月二斗米即可解決。本市米糧來源，係在去年十一月下旬開始在蕪湖·漢口·無錫·松江等地收購後儲藏以作準備者。至美米價格不能太廉之緣故，因其售米所得款項，將作救濟事宜之用，同時美國人亦知中國有「黄牛黨」，價格過低，黄牛黨即將出動搜購。三月一日配米決定實行，其價格在三月月一日看來雖覺僅便宜百分之五，但至三月底時比較即合算甚多。（二）民食調配會成立之目的，在减輕市塲負擔及勿使生活指數由米價高而上漲。自去年六月起至年底，配與職業工人·產業工人·學生·平民·及美國之米共七十萬擔，工人米僅二十四萬一擔，平民米十六萬一擔。九月份起又配煤球，二期共配六十一萬擔，現又開始在配。再爲配油，特向中央銀行借款至靑島等處購買原料，以免影響本市物價。政府對於配米虧本達五十萬億，油款尙係本人向中央銀行借得，所欠達六千八百億，在政府立塲言，可謂對得起人民。（三）勞工行政，主張推行勞工福利，以消滅階級鬥爭，現工廠舉辦合作社等，發展已達相當成功，但尙嫌不足，須儘量推廣。（四）救濟工作，本年度亦擬大加擴充，其經費即在美米　款內撥充，美米售得之款可得四萬億，其中二萬五千億規定作社會經濟，二萬五千億作衛生救濟，上海要求數百億當不成問題。</p>
<h3>公用價格自動調整　成參議員質詢焦點　懷疑煤氣電力罰款保管手續　趙局長向大會逐點解釋</h3>
<p>昨日各參議員對於市府各局之質詢中，以對公用局者最激烈。其最爲參議員反對者，即（一）公用事業之一再漲價，使市民無法負祖。（二）節約用電及煤氣之罰款與電話之超收。周祥生首先問公用局對電力鉅大罰款，其用處何在？能否發還？如不能則最好用在救濟事業上。陳惟儉謂，汽車過戶領照應繼續辦理。朱文德稱，浦東高橋鎭有居民出錢設立之電桿電綫，何以至今電流猶未恢復？費樹聲對趙局長攻擊最烈，除自印長約五千言之書面質詢外，並作口頭詢問。中要者爲（一）公用事業價「自動調整」影響生活指數，增加市民負担過重。（二）節約用電之罰款與超收駭人聽聞，應予取消。同時罰款保管手續是否淸楚？學校及醫院醫師用電決議放寬，何以仍宋照辦？（三）正式公共交通公司何以至今不成立？公共汽車最高價一萬四千元，如居住過遠之公務人員，每日車費即已可觀。此外又提出接裝遷移電話之黑幕，車輛領照時之需索，强銷容電器等情形。陸惠民問各公司電費收費何以不同？賈德超稱，（一）電費罰款從未交到布庫去，何故？（二）野鷄公用車票價較公共汽車低甚多，可見公共汽車漲價不合理。周漆澤謂三輪車執照黑市買二三千萬一張，可否考慮開放一部份？范守淵謂，醫院醫生用電並未放寬，並列舉事實。錢頌平稱，眞如電力公司停電數年，應取銷其合約。李樹滋要求眞如朝陽路裝路燈。趙仰雄稱，滬南電力不足，華商電氣公司與資源委員會協議搬回發電機，情形如何？此外張志韓瞿鉞朱扶九等亦均有問題提出。</p>
<h3>罰疑千億用途分明</h3>
<p>趙局長曾珏逐一答覆稱：（一）罰款已收到一千一百餘億，估計二月底可收二千六百億，發還目不可能，其用途由貴會決議組織之保管委員會決定以百分之七十供裝置路燈，百分之三十補助自行發電之工廠。如建議其他川途，可由大會通過後交保管會分配。（二）汽車過戶已請政院再度放寬，但尙無覆文。（三）浦東高橋鎭電流已責成浦東電氣公司計劃辦理。（四）對。費參議員質詢，關於（甲）「自行調整」，其實並非自動，亦非本八創造，乃由全國經濟委員會將外匯，汕價，生活指數，煤價合計之一種計算公式，應用時也非常審愼，公司方面依此爲計算根據，但每次調整，市府均將其减低至百分之二十至三十，每次有詳細紀錄。（乙）各公司待遇由社會局核定。外籍職員待遇乃根據契約辦理。（丙）公敎人員乘車另有月季票，公共汽車僅三十萬一月，學校醫院有以私人名義登記者，故不知。凡登記者均無不　放。（丁）公共交通公司本希望組織一聯合公司，正與各公司商洽中，且現有車輛並非正式車輛，尙須請求外匯購置正式車輛，以致遲延。（戊）容電器乃經濟部規定，設置後可免使發電器損害。</p>
<h3>辦理區保甲與兵役　民政局長表示焦急</h3>
<p>民政局長張曉崧報吿：略謂辦理區保甲工作及兵役工作，最大困難即在於經費。以後配給制度加强後，區保工作更將繁重，而經費及人員則均感缺乏。關於配給物品，以前十四歲以下小孩不發國民身份證，現則必須一律分發，以配小口物品，此一工作亦屬相當艱鉅。以言征兵，去年三千志願兵雖已徵集，但安家費等困難，實一言難盡，政府僅給每人五萬元，此後幸由兵役協會向四行二局借得一百二十億，使每家得四百萬元，然至今尙有四十五億未曾還淸。今年本市征兵名額增加至六千名，但全部經費須由地方政府自籌，此項費用，估計須一千億，如何籌措？何處籌得？又爲一令人焦急之事。</p>
<h3>電話黑市希望檢舉</h3>
<p>（巳）電話黑市，公司已捉到數工人需索，均已開革。希望檢舉後嚴辦。車輛須照需索，亦已開革及送法院十餘人。（五）新聞記者乘車月季票優待辦法正擬定中。（六）電話超收，每次均在减低。（七）各公司收費不一律，因各公司設備成本均不同。（八）罰款悉數解入市庫，有帳可査。每月十五日解上月費用。野鷄交通車設備簡單，因係外快性質，故收費低，應予取締。局長並表示本人原已向市長辭職，希望有更賢能者接替，使其他人亦有機會嘗試嘗試。（九）三輪車牌照如再開放，則維持中區交通更將困難。（十）眞如電氣公司限三個月復業，否則即由閘北電力公司接辦。（十一）南市華商電氣公司有行總之四千瓩機器將運到，資源委會則不能發還。其他各問題須詳細答覆者，因時間有限，由議長請趙局長書面答覆。</p>
<h3>市長局長報告　全面配米三一開始　每石售價不逾二二五萬</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕吳市長曁社會局長吳開先昨日下午在參議大會休息時間向各報記者報吿二項消息：（一）警局會同金管局査獲港匯秘密電合及四十一家經營金鈔黑市機構，並逮捕大批人員。昨日下午起金鈔已無黑市。（二）全面配米問題，決定三月一日起開始配售，配米證於今日發至各區公所，明日發米，市民於三月一日至四日即可領米。至配售價格，決不超出二百二十五萬元一石，約按二月份最後五天之價格打九五折。而在三月一日至三十一日一個月內米價決不變動。所配之米爲美國洋秈米。又日前社會局仍繼續拋米至月底，每日拋一萬三千担。每石價亦爲二二五萬元。</p>

<p>區民代表主席江兆虎慷慨致詞　（本報攝）</p>
<h3>區長與區民代表致辭　引起大會一片鼓掌聲</h3>
<p>昨日參議會大會散會前，特請本市卅區區長代表北四川路區副區長邱希聖及區民代表大會代表黄浦區江兆虎出席報吿。兩氏詞意懇切，引起大會一致鼓掌。首由邱女士報吿略稱，區公所所辦之事並非僅在淸査戶籍，其實有許多重要工作如衛生淸潔，防疫消毒，治安消防，敎育問題，社會救濟，配給物品，無不由區保協助辦理。然外界對於區保均不了解。而辦事最感困難者，在於經費不足，人員太少，區公所一月份經費五百萬，冀支付水電用費即八百多萬矣。而每保僅有保幹事一人，無論調査戶口，遠近送信，均由其一人出動，保長另有職業，致常有人往保辦處，以不見有人辦事，而引起不滿。市區保辦公處往往有設在商號內較方便，但郊區則全賴幹事一人工作。因此代表全市各區作最低限度要求數點：（一）增加辦公經費。（二）在市政預算內至少請每保增加保丁一名。（三）區公所房屋問題請設法解決。（四）保田長聘用極不容易，請加以保障。繼由江兆虎致詞，謂參議員乃由區民中產生出來，猶如女兒出嫁，務須將娘家意見帶到婆家，數百萬市民對你們期望甚切，希望各位勿使大衆失望，檢討過去四次大會，市府究竟執行多少案子？如果僅執行了十分之一，則參議會即成爲點綴品。聞貴會對於當前物價正討論緊急措施辦法，希望成功。公用事業之漲價，房租按指數標準，均係增加市民負担，決不能任意通過，要求參議會作簡單明瞭切賞之提案，則全市區民決爲後盾云云。議畏對兩氏表示感謝之意。</p>

<h3>警員素質提高　破案效率增加</h3>
<p>警察局長兪叔平報吿工作，其中要點，對於治安方面，因警察素質較前提高，刑事警察知識技術豐富，及淸査戶口等等關係，使破案效率增加，同時發生刑事案件反較前銳减。違反經濟管制案，自去年九月迄本年一月上，破獲黑市金鈔案九〇件，私套外匯案一三件，地下錢莊案一七件，私設電臺案六件。囤積居奇案，破獲食糧案五件，煤炭案五件，油類案四件，紗布案八件，呢絨案一一件，紙張案二二件，其他案八件。此外如交通，禁烟，風化，市容，外事，消防，組　等各項工作均較前改進。</p>

<h3>文明友情道義</h3>
<p>— 第二信　本報特派員毛樹清</p>
<p>〔本報布魯塞爾京城十六日航訊〕非洲比屬剛果殖民地，是今天造成比利時繁榮的基石。第二次世界大戰歐洲霸權的旁落，使大英帝國放鬆了印緬，使法蘭西羈絆不住越南，荷蘭皇國爲了印尼的戰爭，焦頭爛額，惟獨比利時，逍遙於這些煩惱以外。第二次大戰期間，比利時的皇帝鉍納粹俘虜，但倫敦的比國流亡政府，仍然掌握住剛果殖民地，用剛果的人力和資源，作爲復國的本錢。特別是剛果的鈾鑛開採，成爲後來美國製造原子炸彈的主要原料。我去年在美國的時候，有位比國朋友吿訴我，比利時政府拿鈾鑛的原料，償還了美國的「租借法案」，戰後美比之間的國際友誼和商業來往，遠較第一次戰後美國和芬蘭的關係更好。（註：芬蘭是唯一償淸了美國「戰債」的國家）。</p>
<p>剛果鈾礦</p>
<p>布魯塞爾的遍地美國貨，美國電影。再加上年輕比利時男女滿口的美國英語使人聯想起紐約的繁榮，和造成這些繁榮的因素。我問過外交部新聞處的瓦斯先生，可否吿訴我一點關於剛果鈾鑛的生產初開採情形。他贈給我十多本有關剛果殖民地的書籍，裏面有剛果開發的歷史，有利奧波特皇帝二世經營的功績，有剛果黑人的種別，和他們反抗現代物質文明的鬥爭，乃至於到最近比利時統治的政績：五千　學校，一百萬學生，四千座現代化的醫院，診所和療養院，三千二百英里的鐵道，五萬英里的公路。比利時政府的殖民部部長弗里夏威說：『比利時人統治殖民地，並不祗是爲了片面的利益，……帮助殖民地的人民，謀享現代物質文明的幸福，是比國殖民政策的主要原則』。</p>
<p>但是，在這些書裏，找不到半點有關鈾鑛開採的介紹，外交部的瓦斯先生說，鈾鑛是有的，但比國政府不願公佈他。「因爲這還是一個秘密」。他說：在布魯塞爾，有很多外國記者，常常想知道這個問題，但都沒有答覆。</p>
<p>經濟合作</p>
<p>外國記者住在布魯塞爾的很多，但例行的記者招待會却很少，每年偶而有二三次，比較重要的事故，才開記者招待會。現任首相斯巴克，以前聯合國大會的主席，相當歡喜接見記者，我在布魯塞爾停留的時間，正是他到盧森堡去了，斯巴克的機要秘書塞汎先生，是現任外交部的新聞處長，瞿純伯代辦介紹我到拉洛埃街外交部去訪問他兩次，他隨斯巴克首相，都在盧森堡。</p>
<p>盧森堡目前正在舉行比，荷，盧，三國經濟合作方案，在歐洲現在流行着一個新宇呌作“Ｂenelux”，即比，荷，盧，三國國名的連綴速寫。在荷蘭的通訊中，我曾經提到過斯巴克對於三國經濟合作的演講，據局外人的估計：如果三國的經濟單位構成一體，則他們的出入口貿易總額，可以成爲全世界的第三位，除了美國和英國以外，就應該是Benelux了。目前比利時和荷蘭的報紙，都對Benelux　感覺異常興奮，報紙的編輯，把比，荷，盧，經濟合作，甚至較馬歇爾援歐計劃還來得重視。</p>
<p>外長濮希</p>
<p>我因爲時間倉促，沒有去盧森堡訪問，一九四五年，我在巴黎遇見過盧森堡的外交部長濮希，一個以外交部長爲終身職業的輕鬆和藹的老頭子，喜歡講笑話，從來不悲觀，不憂愁，我記得他那時候翹起大姆指，比仿中國，然後再伸出小指的尖端：『那就是我們盧森堡』，他還樂予講和顧少川大使的友誼，講九一八時代松岡洋右的狂妄等等。那一年，我曾經去盧森堡參觀過，闊別兩年多，聽說盧森堡的鋼鐵工業都恢復了戰前的水準他們和比國一樣，都是以鋼鐵爲出口的國家，盧森堡用的錢幣，就是比國流行的通貨，各國駐在比利時的大使館和公使館，都兼駐盧森堡，聽說惟獨中國例外。</p>
<p>中比聯姻</p>
<p>比利時和盧森堡，對中國的友誼都很友善，盧森堡全國三十萬人口中，曾經有一位空前絕後的女郎，嫁給中國丈夫，這大概是十多年以前的事了。一九四五年濮希外長在巴黎吿訴我的。比國婦女和中國聯姻的更多，陸徵祥先生的亡妻就是比國人，聽大使館的人講，陸徵祥先生的近况很好，仍然做他的宗敎工作，我因爲時間迫促，沒有去修道院陸老先生。</p>
<p>中國之友</p>
<p>有位天主敎的使者丁谷鳴神父，戰時追隨着雷鳴遠神父在華北戰地救死護傷的『中國之友』，最近在布魯塞爾有一次相當精彩的公開演講，他講中國的久遠文化基礎，講中國的家庭制度，以及中國的忠孝節義的故事，博得比國社會許多讚揚，那天聽講的有好幾百人，現任商業部長，外交部次長，和以前的紀佑穆大使都在座。丁谷鳴神父的比國名字，原來呌『麥丹』，丁谷鳴三個字，是他到中國以後才取的，瞿純伯代辦替他的演講做結論，說丁神父『認識中國，了解中國，熱愛中國』。聽衆們狂然鼓掌。</p>
<p>無論我們的國運如何艱難，憑我們的道義傳統，在全世界任何角落，都找得到眞正熱愛中國的朋友，我們決不能喪失自信，我們是有理由可以自信的！（於剛泰璧旅館）</p>

<h3>下半時　突起風波</h3>
<p>換籃之後，破陣重圓，兩隊陣容俱無變更，大李雙手一托鵠中紅心，奧柴遼回敬後，大李籃下托入，格朋乞谷夫拉人，被罰二記，大李一球未中，甚爲可惜。奧柴遼二度梅開，恩卡斯以馬漢換却利，奧兩罰俱入，震中還以顏色。格朋乞谷夫五次犯規被黜，茀萊克入調，恩隊反呈活躍，E凱羅斯基奧柴遼及鮑萊，三元連中，追至廿四比廿七，於是局而突吿緊張，風波遂起。成章投入，V凱羅斯基報復，比數仍相差三分，恩卡斯氣勢一振，大施突擊。復追成廿九對卅一相差二分更爲接近。華聯沉着應付，學崇揮中，番將連罰二球，卅一對卅五時，却利再入，老包罰中，學崇建功，恩卡斯茀拉克破籃，阿弟三次犯規離塲，任相成上塲時，僅餘卅秒鐘，鮑萊擲中，比以卅八對卅六力取恩卡斯，保持不敗，險哉。</p>

<h3>產區米價報漲　米市場交易停頓　社會局拋售一萬三千石</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕米市漲風不止，昨日南北二市登記到貨共祗二千四百四十九石，客戶因無錫產價報高，遂多不肯上市脫手，仍落棧於蘇州河糧船中，特觀望態度。市塲情形混亂，謠言衆多，人心虛浮，交易停頓。塲外價至三百萬，尙無成交。社會局依二百二十五萬元價，繼續拋出一萬三千石，分配予二千一百家米號，門售價爲二百四十五萬。但每人限購五升，市民排隊購買者甚衆。　據社會局負責方面稱：目前無錫等地產區米價常有超過本市之反常現像，若本市米價過低，米商以利爲重，形成倒流，影響本市存底，則其後果必較目前更爲嚴重。當局幾經縝密檢討，認爲使米價與各地保持均勢，實最爲車要。現主要除抑平產區價格外，本市自三月起，實施全面配糧，亦可綏和漲風不少。</p>
<p>昨市白粳已突破三百萬大關一度喊高至三百十萬外，後三百〇五萬有少數交易。薄稻亦抵三百萬關，早稻爲二百九十五萬，各較上日猛漲四五十萬元。市塲交易除供應米外，其他毫無交易。</p>
<p>麺粉　因米價猛升，小麥開高至一百九十萬，蘇錫價格猛騰，使買氣更盛，貨主脫意更淡，價格遂再猛升。老車粉開盤一百四十五萬，後回低至一百四十四萬，紅蜂建成各以一百四十萬開盤，後一路曾飛升至一百四十三萬，收市紅蜂爲一百四十萬，建成爲一百三十九萬元，各牌粉各較上日猛漲十二三萬元之鉅。大包麩皮進戶不寂，開市八十五萬，一路升抵九十二萬，收市爲九十萬，軋漲十萬元。</p>
<p>食油　見空前未有之大漲風，市場形勢之緊張，竟至售戶絕跡。値此二期戶口油已開始配售之時，竟有此漲風，殊出意外。昨賣戶擯持至收市仍無交易，收市後有少數交易，廠豆油開六百八十萬，生菜油六百七十萬，各猛漲九十萬之多。生汕暴漲一百萬元之鉅，靑島吉桶生汕七百五十萬成交，交易極爲稀少。豆餅初市狂漲一成，收市回軟，軋升四五百萬元。</p>
<p>雜糧　黃豆客幫及油廠本街均進，漲勢　厲。乍豆晨開一百七十萬元，已較昨市升二十萬元，而需求者仍不乏人，升至一百七十五萬元，計升二十五萬元。漢口車豆爲一百九十萬元，鮮埠黄豆九十萬元，計升二十萬元至二十五萬元之間。紅糧北帮有納，蚱埠紅糧一度高至一百九十二萬，升三十餘萬元。後因去化轉懈，回至一百八十八萬元，芝蔴津帮雖不動辦，因其他各糧俱騰，豈敢落後。九江奶蘇一度升至三百二十萬元，後回低至三百十五萬元，成交不多。生仁在廣帮力取下，跟蹤上揚，秦皇島生仁開四百三十萬元，計升三十餘萬元。揀靑亦昂達一一三十萬元，獨苞米每爲離羣之馬，高檔貨平疲，中關貨走銷較活，價與昨市相仿。</p>
<h3>謠傳英鎊貶值　港幣市價大跌</h3>
<p>〔聯合社香港廿六日電〕港幣自戰爭以來，一向穩定在美金兩角五分又四分之一。廿五日因謠傳英鎊將貶値，公開市塲價跌至美金一角六分。據英政府發言人稱，此項謠言與過去同樣不確，此爲投機家之慣技。同時因有鉅款匯往美國，益增市面不安。金價亦激漲至每盎斯港幣三百七十二元，收盤時回至三百六十五元。</p>
<h3>游資蠭湧而來　華股漲勢難遏</h3>
<p>華股昨中途雖有外來阻力達六次之多，漲而有回。無如物資助威，環境推動，臨收反呈燎原。國貨有新猷，與景綸景福美亞勤興再吿漲停板。</p>
<p>晨開時永紗低至一〇二〇元及一〇六〇元，但小股却繼續放異彩，景綸網續漲停，國貨亦急起直追，開高不少，招來股戶爭購，陡呈求過於供，瞬即漲停。永紗亦步升至一〇六〇元及一〇九五元高價。塲外息價仍開二角一及二角五分半，加上塲外査禁之風加緊，步降至一〇〇五元及一〇四〇元低價，近午重又掀動買風，美亞在二〇七號二二四號吸收下，漲來亦多。一七六號吸收榮豐，買風亦極普及。永紗以一〇六〇元及一〇九〇元收市。較前收即交股國貨景綸漲停，新光麗安升一成，景禍美亞勤興新華中絲漲半成，餘均微升。遞交股華豐微挫，新光景福美亞升半成，勤興漲一成，餘咸微升。</p>
<p>後市上塲即升爲一〇七五元及一一〇〇元，更被進至一〇八三元及一一一〇元，塲外査電話又緊，交通大隊亦開進市傷，國行差進，降至一〇四〇元及一〇七〇元低價。反動一起，塲外復限制對敲，空方惶惶，多方奮抬，臨收反漲到一一四五元及一一五二元新高峯結束。一七六號力購現美亞，二三六號進遞美亞，一七五號進遞勤興，二〇四號進現景福，亦迫漲限。麗安新華臨收亦達限度。結果較晨收即交股計國貨景綸景福美亞麗安新華漲停，內衣平平，新光微升，閘北中法火柴商務統益中紡各升一成光景，餘均漲半成。遞交股勤興美亞漲停，餘均升半成。塲外各未上市股票以銀行股最俏，漲一成。公用股平庸，餘升半成弱。</p>
<p>套利交易</p>
<p>昨仍呈銀根鬆弛現象，貼進者合息不過一角三至一角八，高後步低。貼價計永紗初開四二元，高價四三元，低價三四元，收市三八元。美亞自七五元退至六五元，信和自一八元退至一七元收市。華豐二三元，新光六元半。</p>
<p>升降範圍</p>
<p>證交昨通吿將股票升降範圍，改爲二百元以下者一角，二百元至一千元以下五角，一千元至五千元以下一元，五千元及五千元以上者五元，已於昨日後市起實行。</p>
<h3>統債帶高　外股俏利</h3>
<p>公債昨亦帶高，但難持久。統丙晨開九萬元，高價達十萬元而後步回，大成興五五〇室五五二室買進，五〇三室三六〇室五〇〇室則出。成交約四百萬。較前收計甲乙丁尙平，丙種升一千元，戊種好四千一元。</p>
<p>外股昨中途以港電平定，漲後即回。但過程仍走華股路綫，臨收重吿俏利。廣帮洋行帮出入不一，證券帮先出後進。怡紗晨開一一七萬，回跌至一一一萬而後轉盤，最後市又躍升，迫近一三〇萬高價結束。較前收計怡紗英聯航業各漲半成，餘咸微升。</p>
<h3>紗布一路飛騰　細紗紡建未掛牌</h3>
<p>昨日棉紗市况，晨開時因隔日上漲過鉅，各方都抱觀望態度，行情遂趨平穩。援紡建公司繼續掛牌，僅廿一支以下各檔，四十二支及卅二支均無牌價，因此人心頓告堅昂。四十二支監鳳細紗直上至一億三千萬元，四十支各　衝出一億元大關。</p>
<p>昨日棉布市况，初開時因散戶仍有吐售，攘面一度　壓，喊價均吿疲軟。旋以客帮及染廠吸納，行情再吿奔騰。結果十二磅龍頭五福等各檔細布，比上日續漲自七萬至十五六萬元。</p>
<p>現棉轉穩　昨日現棉市况，交易轉吒，同業見賣即吸，市價上揚，午後棉紗微小，浮多逢高有吐，趨勢　穩。但以來源枯竭，人心仍多居奇，價格仍未見回小。全日成交四五〇包。</p>
<p>紡建售紗　〔本報訊〕中國紡建公司昨繼續代紗管會在紗業公會售紗，共開十六種，准購者約二四〇〇件，合廿支紗三千件左右。</p>
<h3>絲紗織品上漲</h3>
<p>絲織品羽紗袖裹綢，紗織品法西襯花洋布白帆布蔴吿布防雨布軟襯，毛織物呢羢　嘰，宣維華達呢，法蘭絨女色呢火姆四本海力斯師尼鐵尼等，昨來無一不高漲。中紡首先喊漲，章華協新元豐寅豐各廠廠盤跟漲二成，門莊零剪掛牌因此復再猛烈提高。茶會市塲上及大批發戶，標準又入紊亂之途。</p>
<h3>人絲初疲後堅　綢貨交易寂寥</h3>
<p>人造絲昨市上午疲軟，一二〇號旭字有光，開盤價挫至四千三百萬元，中間一度曾漲至四千九百萬元即期價，午收又降爲隔日期四千一百萬元。下午市况突然轉俏，開盤即高至五千五百萬元有成交，最後再挺至六千萬元賣出價。</p>
<p>廠經昨市上午稍堅，做開Ｃ字等級價六千二百萬元，高零担五千八百萬元亦有成交。干經上身零担二千五百萬元有交易。下午續吿抬升，Ｃ字等級喊價高達七千萬元，高零担計價六千五百萬元，惟俱無成交。</p>
<p>綢貨昨市續俏，塲內眞絲被面及格子　縐交易，初因差金發生糾紛，停止開市，後於九時半再行開做，華强被面做五百五十萬元，大誠格子璧縐喊價廿八萬五千元，交易甚爲寂寥，其餘各貨，亦均提升。</p>
<h3>臺幣比率突升　昨為一比一三七</h3>

<p>〔本報訊〕紗管會以邇來物價日形高漲，棉價亦隨而激增，前曾由該會採運處召集有關方面，就市塲實際情形，作合理之調整。</p>

<h3>哀悼恩師法爾教授</h3>
<p>— 梁俊青</p>
<p>陡然地一個噩耗傳來，說是德國的大病理學家法爾老敎授自殺死了。立刻有一種莫可言狀的悲哀横塞在我心頭，敎我引頷西望，呆想了許久。</p>
<p>想起了當年在德國漢堡大學研讀的時候，每天總要在病理解剖室裏暢聆他老人家的訓誨有好幾個鐘頭。到如今我歸國以來已經有十七八年但是我總沒有忘記他那個矮矮的身軀，灰白色的威廉式鬍子，圓而且大的半禿的頭顱和那個慈祥而且常帶微笑的影子。的確，誰只要能够聽見他一次演講，誰就不會忘記了他的慈祥的態度和他滔滔不絕的而且明白曉暢的演詞。然而現在他死了，他因爲　不慣德國敗降後的慘痛情形自殺死了。吹！這眞是全世思醫學界的一個大損失。</p>
<p>我們這位恩師法爾敎授（Prof.　Dr.　Th.　Fahr）現在算起來應該有七十機歲　高齡了吧。他一生孜孜屹屹，埋頭苦幹地永遠在研究，在發明和誨人不倦地在啓迪後進。他在肌肉風濕方面曾經有偉大的硏究。他在癌症方面也有非常或功的發現。此外他在心臟和神經方面也有許多被人崇拜的硏究工作。可是他不像其他的病理學家一樣專門自高自大多方想法去自吹自捧，惟恐人家不曉得他自己的勞績。他老人家却非常地謙和，而且矜持。他雖然可以說是病理學方面的權威，可是他從來不肯自吹自擂，他只曉得把畢生的心血去貢獻於醫學，去訓誨　進。像他這種不要名利，只知爲醫學而奮鬥的人不但是在中國少有，即如以德國來說，也可以說是少有罕見的了。所以我對於他的死眞有無限的傷感！</p>
<p>我常常聽朋友們說：「人生一世，草生一秋。一個人活在世界上，不是爲名便是爲利。如果旣不爲名，又不爲利，那豈不是個呆子嗎？」眞的，這些話眞有它的眞理。我這位恩師也許發現了他自己在做呆子，旣不爲名又不爲利，一生一世只曉得爲民衆謀福利，結果辛勤了一生只能在某種程度上做到了某些救人的工作，然而在世界的任何角落裏却有無數的人羣正在製造殺人的利器或則正在一大批一大批地殺人，所以他灰心了，拿了手槍去結束他呆子式的生涯。</p>
<p>不過我總覺得世界上像他這種呆子實在太少了，如果呆子能够有很多的話，也許這個世界會好了一點。只可惜的是像他這樣的呆子也死了。</p>
<p>唉！他老人家已經很安逸地結束了他呆子式的生涯。不曉得我們每星期在此裏做的工作是他老人家所歡迎的麽？</p>
<h3>肺結核的防禦</h3>
<p>— 余正行</p>
<p>B空氣新鮮空氣是治療結核病的要素，所以病人要多在戶外。若醫師許可，病人可以在廊下睡覺。縱然住在屋子裏面，窗戶要日夜開着。除非天氣不好的時候（如大風等），因空氣不新鮮。是由於空氣中含有炭氣，水分，灰塵，微菌，以及他種不潔之物質。而養氣又同時缺乏，非病人所宜之地。故應住在空氣暢通凉爽的地方。不宜居住在城布，宜遷居於鄉村中，環境優良的地方絛養。居室宜明朗寬闊，淸潔整齊，以免塵埃飛揚。每日開窗戶，使空氣流通，呼吸舒暢。因結核菌在流通空氣中不易存在故。</p>
<p>C氣候氣候對於結核病有相當影響，應選擇高山或海　氣候爲宜。因能引起食慾，增進氧氣供給量，以吒盛新陳代謝，使病機轉變，病情趨於良好。惟肺結核吐血時，不宜於高山。高山與海濱多强風，與急候急變，故當選擇適當而能避免此缺點者爲佳。</p>
<p>（二）營養配製結核病人身體之消耗很大，故補充亦須較多。患者因口味失調，食慾减退，故須予以營養提高，而易消化的滋養品供給病人，以補償其損失。體重增加爲本病輕怏之徵，欲達到此目的，應喚起旺盛的食慾，並選擇極富於滋養的食品。各種主要滋養成份全備，旣不可偏廢，亦不可偏重。使供給人體營養各種的需要，得以平均。但應戒過度，以防胃腸障礙。食品中以鷄蛋，鷄肉及新鮮蔬菜爲良。其他如肉類及牛乳次之，惟中國人一般對牛乳無習慣，尤應顧及。再搭以適當之碳水化合物，及大量的維生素丙，以資調劑。而少　的酒類噢起食慾，在所不禁。魚肝油極富有維生素甲及維生素丁，有滋養身體和增加抵抗力的效能，可以多用。服時亦當注意其食慾，稍有障礙，即可停用。然各種飲食於食量方面，祗求適可而止，不必勉强。</p>
<p>（三）安　療養肺結核患者之治療主要在靜養。故當使患者絕對安靜，臥床休息，而少於勞動。因一般肺結核病人，往往因消耗過多，難進飲食，營養不足。若過於運動，則更增加其消耗，因此必須充分休息，以維持其生理機能。然其躺臥地方，還須顧及日光照射部份與時間等。蓋結核病臥床休息之目的，如創傷休息使之再生同。因肺於跑路時每分鐘呼吸五十次，於步行時呼吸二十五次，於靜臥時呼吸一十次。即靜臥時肺運動可减少至十次，而增加肺休息與再生之能力及機會。休息並不是僅不工作而已，休養乃是躺臥在床上，安心靜養。身體休養還不够，還要精神的休養。憂愁煩悶，焦急多慮，能使精神不安寗。精神不安寗，不能得充分休養的益處。終日對於本身的病，憂憂戚戚者，是意志力薄弱的表現。必定要心神暢快，病自易愈，所謂心廣體胖也</p>
<p>防禦設備</p>
<p>（一）設立結核病咨詢處應在地方衛生機關，專門設立結核病咨詢處，以作禦防結核病的中心。其主管防禦結核病之事宜，爲對結核病之衛生敎育，對健康人的勸導，監督，並從事預防，或改良患者之生活環境，營養，職業，並指導其療養，及侍護法則。或將患者送到適當療養院，予以隔離。</p>
<p>（二）普設結核病診護所地方政府有防止結核病之義務。並應普遍設立結核病診護所，其主要工作，在謀求早期診斷，發現新病例，檢査接能者，監護留家療養病人。並開設夜晚門診部，以便利病工的就診。他如結核病人的家庭訪視，護理，消毒，檢驗，敎導，隔離等，均當極力推行</p>
<p>（三）療院療院可分爲療養院與治療院二種。凡急性，危重，疑難病例，概送治療院。豫後較佳，而需要長期療養者，則送療養院。此外，如養癆村的設置，以收容出院病人，而須與就業的輔導，及營養住屋問題的解決，亦甚重要。</p>
<p>（四）强制開業醫師參與防禦工作醫師診治肺結核病人時，有敎導其預防方法的義務。並有報吿衛生當局的義務。開業醫師必須與衛生當局合作，同心協力爲防癆而努力，成爲防癆工作之一班。</p>
<p>（五）確定衛生行政權衛生行政當局認爲有傳播肺結核病危險時，有發令處分的權能。尤以對於工廠，學校的設備有勒令改進權限。結核病人及其家屬，應有服從衛生當局執行任務的義務。</p>
<p>預防播種：預防肺結核病，可以應用BCG疫苗,使體內產生特殊免疫大，抵抗結核菌。BCG疫苗發明於一九二一年，原名是Baciles　de　Calmetteet　Guerin，由法人Calmete　t和Guerin　發明而命名。GBC爲一種牛體中的結核菌，經過嚴密的處理以後，注進人體可以無害，而發生對結核菌的抗抵力。BCG疫苗在嬰兒身上，可以增强對於結核菌的抵抗力，而减低嬰兒的結核病死亡率。在有結核病者的家庭裏的初生兒，並不可靠，而仍以隔離爲要，但在預防傳染上有很大的價値，可以廣泛推行。歐洲幾個國家採用很久，成績最好的要算丹麥。現在歐美國家都遍普採用，蘇聯衛生當局，推行尤力。美國衛生部本年七月指定伊里諾哀大學，以三十六萬金，預備製造供給全國的BCG疫苗，俾便普遍推行全國，防禦結核病侵襲。我國衛生當局亦有此項準備，果能普遍接種於未經感染者，防癆成績亦大有可觀。</p>
<p>結論</p>
<p>結核桿菌是人類的公敵，全世界的人，幾乎無人能幸免其崇。免者，似反屬例外。在十歲以內小孩，用結核菌素種皮膚反應，已有百分之九十七呈陽性。近代病理學家發明初期複合病灶羣，更證明在屍體解剖之際，人人都患結核病。就任一死因作標準，死亡率斷沒有比結核大的。即人類死於結核菌的數量，比任何死因爲多。比戰爭，災害亦多，比其他法定急性傳染病更多。我們前面已經了解，結核病傳染最可怕的是：（一）多侵犯年富力强的壯年人，能將勞動力最旺盛的國民，多數奪去。間接影響生產率低降。（二）城市多於鄉村，學校及工廠多於普通地方。此使國家生產，教育，政治等，進步的精萃所在地方，遭受嚴重摧殘。（三）由肺結核病而成結核性體質，患病日增，死亡益多，人口鋭減。長期慢性疾患，於人口質量方面言之，均爲種族退化的先聲。亦即民族素質衰弱的象徵</p>
<p>我國戰時肺結核病旣普遍廣泛的流行，妨害民族健康。全國國民不論精神上，身體上或物質上均遭受重大損失。人壽短促，愈格死亡，實國家絕大濟在危機。吾人應隨建國的需要，改進民族素質，充實國力，積極實施結核病之防。統一計劃，普遍施行。表面要求能解除患者痛苦，實則應减少患者，杜絕傳染，促進强國富民。因此，應嚴格實行防禦結核病，使民族健康，國家當强，則爲民族之大幸也。</p>
<p>總之，防　工作是今日民族自強的一種重要工作。防　即是自衛，亦即自求生存之途。「你不殺　，　必殺你」。因此站在人道的立場上，以自己生存爲出發點，　求改進，寶施社會保健，淸除可怕的肺結核病。今日經濟的不平等，已經是社會的不公平與不幸。再由經濟的不平等，而人民不能享受健康的保障，這更是不公平的事情。同時站在國際局勢看，要能應付演變，要提高國際地位，政府應實施公醫制度，保障人民健康，以及其生存的安全。因此希望政府有計劃的，有步驟的，防禦結核病。社會人士，更應激發義務感，同心協力，剷除我們生命的威脅，與生存安全的障碍——肺結核病。（續完）</p>

<h3>醫藥下鄉論（上）</h3>
<p>— 徐勁</p>
<p>這眞是無容諱言’的事實，醫師與藥房大都集中在都市，且不說窮鄉僻壞的居民享受不到新醫與新藥的洗禮，就是距海　遠或鐵路幹綫所通達不到的縣鎭，還是在受一般巫師和江湖郞中，的愚弄，西北邊區的同胞生了病，據說就請一位巫師念一通咒語，來一個「憑天斷」，何謂「憑天斷」？就是把病人抬在黨日之下，曝曬三天，如果這病人生前並未作孽，照巫師的說法，他的病一定有救，可以不藥而愈，曬了三天而病猶不愈，那就是作孽太多，命中無救，也只有　其自斃。另有一種傳說，是某地的病人如有高熱，也必請巫師來治病，巫師未到，將病人的衣服剝掉，手提一根鞭子，口中念念有詞，一面追着病人抽打，病人倉皇焦急，　着至中奔逃一直奔到氣喘力竭，猝然倒地，巫師然後　去　子，附囑將病人抱起，用毛巾將汗水揩亁，再用被　好，就此躺臥一夜，據說次日寒熱便可降退。當巫師在拼命抽打病人時，病人家屬只在屋外竊聽，直至病人倒地，巫師高呌，家屬始敢進來，連口稱謝巫師不止。這在我們外鄉人看來確是一種趣劇，然而這趣劇中包含多少無聲的愚昧與眼淚！</p>
<p>從科學立塲上講來，這種治法還不完全是荒謬無稽。日光曝　對於某些病確有些功效；在病人身後用鞭子趕着打，除了有逼着病人出汗的功用用外，還有發散局部充血的效果（Decongestion），這都是物理療法（Phystotheiagie），但是以一成不變的方法米治療千變萬化的疾病，那當然是不够的，並且不問病勢，濫用此法，也不合理，　讓巫師們在代行醫師的職務，這是醫界同仁　恥辱！</p>
<p>筆者於去秋嘗應某軍長特邀，到過徐州市北賈汪鎭去小住了兩個月，耳目所接，引起了不少的感觸，切實地體驗了都市醫師爲什麼不願下鄉去。那賈在鎭離開徐州市不過七十里，還有華東煤礦公司的小鐵路可通，尙不算僻鄉，但是已使醫師深感不便那邊沒有像樣的藥房，醫師的處方輙愁無處可配。幸而那裏還有一家礦區醫院，軍事長官們還可以向那醫院配藥，但也只有成藥，無專人配方，於是　一張極普通的方紙，也得坐火車到徐州去配購，有時徐州也配不出，那就只好不用。因此在那裏行醫，須得自備　物，不然也須知道市上藥物的種類，處方時便只得在那些藥物上選挑，有醫而無藥，還是活不了。</p>
<p>礦區醫院是那煤礦公司私有的，專爲醫護礦工及其家屬而設。淪陷時期由日人管理，據說規模相當完善，日本貨藥物也積存得很多，勝利以後歸國人接收，許多器械都殘缺不全了，院中房屋也有好幾問給軍隊住着，只留出三間給院方應用，醫院已不成其爲醫院，但是門診却極忙碌，內各科門診每日有三百餘名病人，却只有位醫師應診。醫師連聽診的時間兩都沒有，只是問一問病况便簽字處方，每天的工作，照那醫師的自述便只是如何打發病人走，因爲實在是忙不過來。然而據新來的王院長（由衛生部派來接收的）說這兩位醫師是留用下來的，資格恐都有問題，現在一切正在整頓中，衛生部已與礦公司當局洽議，由公司出資建造房屋，添設病房部中將有大批聯總的藥物器械發來，彼此合作屆時當另聘各科醫師和護士來，然後諸事方可就軌。他還想和醫學院合作，由醫科學生常到那兒去實習，並共同硏究當地流行的傳染病，這一計劃如果實行確然很好，但直至筆者離開那裏，房屋還未全部完工。</p>
<p>如果衛生部當局能有具體的計劃，將大批醫師與藥物分佈到各地去那是我們所樂見其成的，醫師公會更該協助這一計劃的完成。</p>
<h3>希望大家趕快種痘！</h3>
<p>— 張寶書</p>
<p>新年祈福　惟有防病　要防天花　只有種痘</p>
<p>歲序更新，人人祈福，福不能自天來，要求自己，己即是神，神即是己也。</p>
<p>大地回春，萬物皆生，細菌亦是生物，焉能不生，旣生就活躍在吾人四週，若不求衛生，隨地隨時，可侵入人體，疾病生矣，威脅生命，輕則耗力耗錢，重則人財兩空。</p>
<p>春天敵人，人人耳熟，天花，腦膜炙（俗名急驚風），白喉，猩紅熱，麻疹（俗名　子，不甚危險）六位六敵，小生命最爲難保，老少亦是不能幸免，還有無數敵人參加熱鬧，但是人在中間，則受到四面楚歌，爲何不用衛生方法武裝起來，保衛自己的生命？</p>
<p>目前最大敵人就是「天花」，最好而最妥的武裝惟有「種痘」希望人人用祈福的信心，刻不容緩的快快去種！</p>
<p>由防疫的過程中，吿訴吾們：「以下幾種人們非種不可」，否則失去生命的安全。</p>
<p>一，新添的官官寳寳們們落地後—不等待臍帶脫　—就立刻要種，五天不發，再要種，一直種到發足爲止。</p>
<p>二，種過牛痘的官官寳寳們！每年春天或冬天要複種，最好在天花開始發現的時候就種，毋須等犬暖或花朝日，五天不發，再要種，亦種到發了爲止。</p>
<p>三，　過牛痙的男女同胞們呈每遇天花開始發現的時候就要複種，請不要忘記，四夭察看一下，發了沒發，不發還是要種，種到發了爲止，才能安全。</p>
<p>四，幼時種過「傳種漿苗」人們！發得不足和年久不複種的人，還是要複　，發了才安全。</p>
<p>五，幼時種過「鼻苗」人們！發得不足和年久不複種的人，亦還是要複種，種到發了爲止，才能安全。</p>
<p>撲滅天花，除種牛痘外，還要緊的隔離，就是生天花的人，立刻送到傳染病醫院，住在院內醫治，一直到痂壳掉凈，才放他出來，這種方法是最妥當沒有的了！</p>
<p>上面的一切，希望人人合作，而且個個做到，幸福就無窮，毋須去祈求了！</p>
<p>編者按作者張寳書醫師係市立第二傳染病醫院院長，他因爲近來天花非常猖獗，特地在百忙中抽出時間來寫這篇文章，希望全上海的市民趕快去種痘，以免傳染天花，這也是呆子式的作風，但願上海的市民不要辜負呆子的苦心吧！</p>

<h3>學店頌</h3>
<p>— 王起</p>
<p>雖然英國的牛津劍橋都有些二私立性質，中國人却永遠是看不起私立學校的。在國立或公立學校讀書的子弟，儼然比私校學生高着一級。私立學校有如公立學校的垃圾車，凡是不能考入公校，或是被公校除名斥退的，便以私　爲尾閭。從前我在北平，某中學方在創辦，特別標明了凡投考過某著名國立大學附中者，可以免試，並不限於在某附中取錄與否，也則是說，凡有膽子考某附中者，其來頭定不小，而某私中便以某附中之專用垃圾車自居矣，於是，其學生果然大多而特多，且課程也亦步亦趨的學某附中，雖則其水準不見得怎樣高。</p>
<p>考國人之所以輕視私校者，無非以其要錢故耳，尤以其要錢而無成績故耳。某私中以某附中爲標榜，是力爭上遊的廣吿，吿訴家長們，我雖要了大價錢，貨色尙非完全爛汚，這是不可厚非的。有些學校整年在大門口鑒一塊「隨到隨考」的招牌，而枉顧者竟爾寥寥，那才是天大的殺風景。若按我的理想，在中國的環境之下，確是應當只有私校會辦好，而公校不與焉，何以故？第一，這種學校不受人事影響，校長不必攀龍附鳳，講什麼內綫外綫，裙帶同鄉，更不必發愁五日京兆，鐵打衙門流水官。即使你開的是學店，（按目下情形，開店之弊，是一時沒法肅淸的！）只要老板稍微情形好轉，大可掏出一點良心，給別人謀點福利，發賣一些眞實貨色，不比公家學校，（其實何嘗不是店，今日師生名分已成瞎扯，學生上學，只覺得自己是花了銅鈿的大小姐，闊少爺，敎員乃是窮酸，犯了規，不及格，此處不留人，自有留人處）！校長辦公有如到衙門，又如店內同人，視賠賺成敗如秦越肥瘠。旣是自己的事業，至少也該盼他發達，不該看着他凋落。所以質言之，我倒不反對什麽學店，發賣貨色之謂「店」，花了錢沒有貨色之調「騙」，如今之店，乃是「騙」，而非眞正之「店」也。第二，旣是自家之店，其建設發展，可以憑自己的理想與自由，不受這個那個的干涉，中國的「層峯」眞要命，一個預算，一個計劃，東一呈西一轉，起碼三個月，批准了也不成爲錢了，買什麼東西起碼價錢差一兩倍，計劃也便隨之吿吹。自己的店，自己有錢，可以隨時隨地的改良建設即以圖書館及實驗室而論，無論什麽學校，都是最重要的條件，可是公家學校能否一下子提出若干千萬買書籍藥品，一定成爲問題。又如班次的伸縮整編，公校也沒有這樣方便，用人的標準薪給，更是可以完全自由，若眞想吸收人子，即大學敎授敎育專家又何嘗不可以重價招之而來，此在公校，均是不能辦到的。第三，學店辦得好，名利雙收，雖不能得什麼勛章，總可以弄個熱心敎育「樂育英才」之類的匾額。試看今日之張伯苓先生，及當年之葉澄衷老板，豈不可以作今日諸位學店老板之榜樣？第四，若果我們還有理想，還有抱負，私立學校才是最合宜的實騐塲所，何以，因無上述諸牽製故也，從前商務附設之尙公小學，中華附設之萬竹小學，皆曾爲許多新敎學法之測騐，試問公立學校如何能得到那種雄厚的援助與力量？準上諸說，私立學店，對社會又何害焉。不過如今的辦法，不是揠苗助長，便是且旦而伐之，把學生作爲敲　的對象，視敎員如同廠中工人，（工人待過可比敎員好的多，不過其勞資對立的關係相彷耳。）拼命榨取其勞動力，而不顧及其生活。我曾晤過一個校長，他很想把學校辦得合理化，尤其注意到敎師的生計問題，他想把敎員　金全部買了食米或金鈔，以免受到損失，我說很好很好，但昨天看報，知廣州因私中校長將數萬億學費投資金鈔而致行情大亂，金鈔暴漲，警局將澈査懲辦云云，那麼，不用說作校長的專想獨贏，而不顧及別人，利益均沾的設施根本辦不到；即使眞有那麽開明的分子，要因此而引起金融波動，我可負不了那麼大的責任呀！說來說去，這是整個社會的癌腫，有什麽辦法可以解決？若是政府認爲私校不合理，就該根本取消他們。只限制收費不許逾額，四百萬與四百五十萬，乃是五十步與百步之比，實在沒多大　　。與其如此，何如　進一步　監　其用途與分配呢？</p>
<h3>阿爾卑斯山在走動</h3>
<p>— 楊寶</p>
<p>瑞士的聯邦硏究院的地　家們突然向歐洲宣佈了他們那震撼學界的發見：阿爾卑斯山在走動！</p>
<p>這號稱爲歐洲的脊樑的大山是永無止息的向北面移動，牠的速率是在每百年中前進十二英呎。高達九七二一英呎的羅士卑茲山峯，據研究是一直在「向慕尼黑進軍」，但這不必使那些法利亞的居民驚慌，他們算出要到二百萬年後，這莊麗的山峯才能「走達」到慕尼黑的大街上呢。</p>
<p>另外一個重大的發見是萊茵河每年要從阿爾卑斯山脚沒吞下約一萬萬立方英吋的山土，隨河流吐給康士坦湖。按這個速率，到一萬六千年後，這個幽美的大湖將被這些山土填平。</p>
<h3>論汽車</h3>
<p>— 則仕</p>
<p>蝸居沿街，　名北京西路，上海大街之一。汽車往來如織，喇叭聲波波不已，夜深始絕，一天約聽十六小時，聽得實在難過，因想汽車何必如此之多。假如上海沒有汽車，豈不於我甚好，因耳根得以淸靜。假如全國沒有汽車，豈不富國裕民。</p>
<p>世界上汽車最多的國家大家知道是美國，汽車最少的是那國恐怕都不知道。據美國人言，汽車最多的國家好像就是最文明的國家，這是賣瓜說瓜甜的說法，美國原是汽車工業最發達的國家囉。即使汽車眞的足以代表文明，一時不文明也沒有辦法。向美國訂購汽車是備受歡迎的，向他借點款子却大難，而付他車款又不肯收法幣關金。還有汽油問題。故中國如始終不用一輛汽車，國庫必較充裕。這是不用汽車足以富國的理由。</p>
<p>其次講裕民。今日的坐汽車　女即昔之坐轎子階級。汽車夫只需一名，抬轎子却非二人不可。以車易轎，即所以解決失業問題之若干部份。轎夫工錢則以省下來的汽油費支付之必有餘而無不足。</p>
<p>即把範圍縮小點來說，今日各機關裁員之說甚囂塵上，嚇得公務員膽戰心驚。我想何不以車易人，即裁車而不裁人呢？一個機關的冗員不見得多於各長官的代步品吧。何况一車之費在賬簿上一定多於一員之薪水。</p>
<p>你大可說汽車之行如飛，節省時間，大有助於坐汽車者的辦事效率。這話似是而實非。記得某種新檢字法初發明時，其廣吿爲：用此檢字法檢字，每天可節省時間五分鐘，一月節省一百五十分鐘，一年節省一千八百分鐘，我們少活點活個六十歲，就共省時間十萬零八百分鐘，六十分鐘爲一小時，二十四小時爲一天，即省下了一千八百小時，計七十五天，兩個多月呢。用此新檢字法檢來了二個多月壽命豈不可貴。當時我看了默然。　思普通人查字典，平均一天未必查到五分鐘，那裏省得下此數，即使省得下來吧，在別種地方浪費掉的時間何止五分鐘。坐汽車之能節省時間，每天確不僅五分鐘，問題是省下來的時間去作什麽用。譬如說從田街至乙街步行需一小時，汽車不過五分鐘，以汽車代步固省四十五分鐘，但利用這四十五分鐘的方法甚多：如我歡喜睡覺，就以之多睡一覺，如你喜歡打牌，就以之多打四圈……當然如喜歡辦公，可以之多辦一點公。不過第一，喜歡辦公的人恐怕奇缺，第二，即使你歡喜辦公也不許你多辦，因辦公是有一定時間的，譬如說上午九時起吧，坐汽車省下來的四十五分時間就無法移作辦公之用，即坐汽車者不會八時一刻即到。而且事實上坐汽車去辦公的人十九比步行去的後到。</p>
<p>寫到這裘，有一女太太來訪內人，談到她的一個表妹的丈夫新近升官發了財，就娶起妾來，且有「寵妾滅妻」之勢，說完　一口氣曰：「一到丈夫坐汽車，做太太的前途就岌岌可危了。」不覺菀爾，因附識之。</p>

<h3>不忘</h3>
<p>— 可洛</p>
<p>美國的一個小城　，有一個很仁慈的醫生。城　住着一個農夫，常常請他去治病，這農夫家境貧寒，夫婦體質皆弱，而孩子極多，幾乎每一個人都常常害病，而那個可憐的父親却祗得仰屋興嗟，無力負擔這筆醫藥　。</p>
<p>但是，當他們請那個醫生去診治時，那個醫生却是有求必應的，常常爲了看護病人而通脊不眠。那個農夫除了勉付極小一部份診金聊表心意之外，也常當送些鷄蛋和別的農產品給醫生。</p>
<p>現在，這位　生已經死了多年，而那位農夫的晚景倒極好，子女都已長成，生活也漸漸優裕起來，當年的貧病交迫，在今日看來，似乎祗是一塲噩夢。</p>
<p>可是，醫生的女兒家裏，却至今常有這位農夫家裏人的踪跡。他們經常送一點鷄蛋蔬菜之類給她——至今仍是如此。醫生雖已長眠，但這受惠的一家對他的厚恩却是永遠忘不了。</p>

<p>渚齋道：「老板要安歇，我也回去了！」小王媽很失望道：「怎麼就走了？你問明白沒有，那位妙繆是聆什麽的」？渚齋搖搖頭道：「我摸不淸，他沒詳細吿訴我，　後再說吧。」說完，匆匆走下樓梯，一逕出門。走到馬路上，心裏很茫然，不知走向那裏才好，信步在馬路旁躊躅，心裏只是轉念，綺紈今天說話太曖昧，她平日對人很坦白，尤其對我無話不談，無事不商量，今天對我說話，忽冷忽熱，神氣比往常大不相同。她昨晚一晚沒回來，也不肯說明到那裏去，十有八九，是和那姓繆的在一起。渚齋想到這裘，妬念倐生，把足一跥，覺得昨晚爲她扣憂，爲她奔走，竟是白操心。一人在馬路旁，癡立好一會，才回過神來，沿着馬路，一逕到宿舍，心裏頹喪極了。一人躺在床上想了一回，仍想不出　紈何以有此變態。腦筋亂雜，似要在亂絲裏，抽出一個頭緒來，加以硏究，祗是愈想愈糊塗。翻身坐起來，瞥見床前小几上，放着一瓶白蘭地，這本是綺紈送給他的，預備他早晨天氣不好，喝了一口出來，免得冲冒寒氣。渚　對這瓶酒，痴痴想了一回，覺　平日綺紈對他體貼無微不至，何以今日有此變態？變態原因是在那演？種種揣測，總想不出。於是拿了一隻酒鍾，把茶凡上的白蘭地，倒了一杯，一飲而盡，又翻身躺在床上，想要靜攝心神，睡一會，舒一舒腦筋，無如思緒縈繞腦海，循環不絕，愈要睡愈睡不着，於是又翻身坐起，又把白蘭地滿滿喝了一杯。這一杯白蘭地喝進去，腦神經竟被麻木了，眼皮一　，覺得天旋地轉，不一會工夫，竟入睡鄉。渚寶靠了這兩杯酒，竟得一夜酣睡。到第二日，一覺醒來，腦筋一動，思緒又驀上心頭，覺得以綺紈平日爲人，不至有此變態，現在不用追究她，只勸她不要和那姓繆接近，以免被他誘惑；自己也要檢討一下，有什麽不好處，給綺紈看出來。果然自己有錯，便　須改過，免生誤會。</p>
<h3>關於儲南強先生</h3>
<p>— 施叔範</p>
<p>本刊最近兩載宜興儲簡叟事，以其戰後聲聞寂然，　致懷念。不佞與南强先生，薄有淵源，且至今音問常通，故述其近况，曁過去避寇大略，以爲關注先生者吿。簡叟其別署也。</p>
<p>自軍興至於烽熄，先生始終居宜興張渚之善卷洞，中間雖一度避地廣德，然亦爲時甚暫。方三十年冬，余流寓西天目山，草檄賀揚靈先生幕中，其地扼控三邊，遙接宜廣，使車絡繹，時得聞簡叟起居；爲我傳言通候者，則復有三戰區黨政會之趙福基君，松雲在望，只差把晤耳。天目去宜，計程須四五宿，又徑多崎嶇，秣馬陟阪，體不勝勞，故寒暑再周，迄未一往，曾報以書云：「笠澤烟波，渺渺莫接」思之未嘗不爽然也！先生身處草野，而望重東南，當時鎭帥疆吏，一麾經過，輒下車造訪，所多諮　，不知者往往見其弓刀在巷，疑爲率子弟三千，從事殺賊矣；訛言流道，此遂有打遊擊之傳說也。迨後，余轉赴浙東，音信中斷者逾年。前歲旅食來滬，乃復與此老修魚雁，拾前塵；洞中歲時，梅花當曆，知其迄猶難得一履陽羡城裏也。去秋，先生謀　次善卷庚桑雙洞事蹟，梓以行世，嗣紙價日高，延而未果。臘尾損書，則謂洞口之善卷寺，兩度修葺，皆歸毁圯，今不敢再事崇飾矣。刧後江山，未邊寗止，我望故園，正同此感！先生畢生心力，耗於雙洞，發幽闡秘，貧勞不辭，其旨要在使乾坤之奇，公諸天下，故雖斧鑿丹黄之處容有可商，却未可遽因此而短之焉。憶民國廿一二年之間，友人姚元幹兄，嘗介先生使庚雁蕩蔣叔南翁，抵掌一室，　衣於萬峯巔；維時蔣銳意興建雁山，而先生正亦狂輸黄金於雙洞內，遙相傾心，又各遙領山水長，一且相見，飛沫濕燈，蓋二老皆健談，復契所好，日行數十里，繼之通宵無寐，不覺其倦也。奈幾何時，叔南自況於石門潭，懷沙投湘，事難究詰；獨先生呼吸淸靈，老猶脾睨於湖波嵐影間耳，然而今亦古稀以外人矣。先生享名甚早，方其壯盛，已與南通張季直，武進蔣竹莊，各重一州，或戲謚日土皇帝，要係尊之，緣迹其生平，功浮於罪，自有定論焉。歲首得先生柬，約杏花時節，遲我於碧蘚庵；以京杭道之宜川段，即可竣工，由川埠折至張渚，亦正在敷設橋樑焉。十載阻兵，桃源難到，何期一夢醒春，猶得見此老提榼相迎於洞口耶？牘尾，素寄西安雁塔照片，想排遣老懷，多仗注述，憾刺天片影，無從檢奉耳。先生有女公子曰能子，擅詩文，工擊劍，昔年易君左兄，嘗作明珠寳劍歌以張之，傳經伏女，料亦中歲，但未詢明適誰氏，儔此嘉妃，真清福哉！</p>
<h3>西北的青城：　興龍山（上）</h3>
<p>— 君左</p>
<p>泉水清無底，高樓看兩山。伐薪樵子樂，煮茗到童歡。樹碧浮螺黛，天青書彩環。幾多名利客，何似白雲間？</p>
<p>——易君左：游興龍山——</p>
<p>靑城山，中國名山之一，在四川省灌縣。抗戰期間，有一時期我在成都服務，因敵機轟炸，一家疏散，移住這座靑城山最高的一峯上淸宮，與張大千兄爲鄰。那時就有一首律詩寫移住上清宮及青城山的美景：</p>
<p>朝辭錦里夢芙蓉，暮宿靑城第一峯。風挾烟痕吹作霧，山連人影化爲虹。雨聲中夜雷　震，日色平明瑪瑙濃。幾樹梅花紅似火，滿籃茶葉碧如葱。</p>
<p>靑城山是被陸放翁　爲翠浪一般的名山（山如翠滾盡東傾），林木茂盛，　　天日，吳稚老稱爲天下第一幽境。三十六峯，峯峯秀麗，蒼翠欲滴。這座山四川，幾與峨眉山分庭抗禮。</p>
<p>我來關州後，一看西北的山多是黄土童山，非常掃興。圍　蘭州的山如畢　白塔等，有名雖有名，但都是寸草不生。後來有人說：只有興龍山大大不同，全山盡是古木濃陰，往遊之後，果然名不虛傳，簡直是西北一個奇蹟。因爲這座山，其幽秀美麗，林木　蔚，酷似靑城。截至最近止，我一共去游了三次，每次都疑入青程夢境書境。</p>
<p>興龍山離蘭州市九十華里，屬榆中縣，有公路直達山麓。過了榆中縣城，一條小小的長街沿溪而行，夾岸綠楊，景色即漸漸不同了，迎面兩座高峯對峙：西面的名棲雲山，果面的名興龍山（俗稱興隆山，是因在遜淸時代怕褻　皇帝的尊嚴，　用龍字，改成了俗不堪耐的生意興隆的隆字。（高度相差有限；兩山間一條淸溪，天然形成一道鴻溝。兩山的聯緊靠一座　橋，名雲龍橋，取「　從龍」之意。</p>
<p>棲雲山麓有一座蔣主席曾經住過的別墅，整潔華麗，現由蘭州勵志社經營，作爲招待所，供給遊人食宿。別墅後是朝元觀，正殿三楹，祀呂祖神像，紅靴黄袍，手持毛帝，幽默地坐在神　裏想心思。殿右有碑室六間，備載本山歷史。朝元觀以上，即穿入森林裏面。整個東西兩山被茂林包裹，蒼翠籠葱。棲雲山挺秀拔萃，超然不羣，曲磴盤旋，殿宇　比。山徑雖不寬，但很整潔，時有道人關枯枝，拓路面；坡度也不大，爬山不費氣力。古木濃陰，淸凉如秋。由朝元觀西行，縣崖削立，上建洗心亭，有悟元子手錄呂祖百字碑及其自撰的棲雲歌，亭後有一座壯觀而空無一物的福緣樓。北行有悟元子祠，祠中供奉一個而黄肌瘦形容枯槁的悟元子羽化時的神像，祠前有一塊書法蒼勁　工精絕平滑而整齊的石碑，是悟元子惟一親自甚勒的「悟元傳家寳」。祠後左右山崗上，各建一所同樣大小的殿宇，左祀觀音，右祀丘祖。從這些地方，又可看出佛敎的色彩混合到道敎裏。如靑城山雖是這敎名山，但一樣有佛寺；上淸宮正殿除供奉老子塑像外，並供奉孔子，儒家色彩也竄進來。觀音殿後有牌樓一座，顏曰：上天梯，再上爲風月嶺，怪石嶙岣，頗有畫意。由風月嶺上去，到元壞殿，一名黑虎殿，內祀斬妖降魔諸神像，面目黨黑，形狀猙獰。後有一亭，可資休息。附近懸崖上正建新亭，面對古松數株，亭亭如蓋，幽媚絕似黄山獅子林的那座小石台。左上有一排小屋，中有二洞：一爲二仙洞，一爲三聖洞。二仙洞內塑秦李二仙神像，均生於宋慶元年間，結茅於本山朝陽洞。李仙名元會，後改名致亭，做過諫議大夫；秦仙自稱秦時閹人，後改名自通。他們爲什麽出家？雖不可考，但兩人性格和身世可以從遺詩上看出。李仙有悲感詩：「富貴功名久不題，心灰意冷學痴迷，邇來性　無人事，好向雲山深處棲。」秦仙詩：「依天危閣貼重岡，細雨濛洄玉磴長，曲　碧流疏宿雨，夾山紅葉映夕陽。」夕陽應是斜陽之誤。由二仙洞後盤旋上山到靈官殿，再上爲七眞殿，內有十七尊神像。再上有一碑棋，名：三台嶺。右行一里爲王母宮，宮南有朝陽洞，即秦李二仙修眞處。前行數十步又有碑樓一座，名：寂靜　。一角危樓，高掛峭壁，名白雲窩，內有一臥佛像。更上爲壽星庵，南下坡爲雷祖殿。復南行有自在窩，縣悟元于神像。洞前右壁上有碑兩方，爲悟元子自題的限藥方和回文詩。這些道家古蹟靈方歪詩之類，走遍天下名山，到處相逢，並不足奇；所奇的在自在窩旁有一小土屋，屋頂作螺旋式，上小下大，形象八卦，相傳是悟元子著書煉丹處。循石級而上，有悟元子的藏書樓，現經封閉。悟元子姓劉名一明，山西沃縣人，又號素樸子，又號被陽散人。據傳他在淸乾隆已酉年間，路過楡中，訪秦李仙蹟於棲雲山，逐結應於此，精硏道學，苦修了四十餘年，才羽化登仙，生平著述註譯如林，如：三易註略，周易　眞，金剛解目，心經解蘊，修眞九要，神寳八德，及棲雲筆記等，道些著作，早已缺殘。絕頂大殿名混元閣，有一根六角形的通天柱，算是登峯造極。</p>

<h3>Chairman Returns to the Capital from Guling, Will Personally Preside Over the National Affairs Conference Today; Executive Yuan Passes the Overall Political and Economic Strategies for the Central China War Zone</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 26th] Chairman Chiang and his wife returned to Nanjing on the 26th, traveling from Guling to Xunyang by car and then plane. The plane took off from Jiujiang Shilipu Airport at 3:40 PM, with Chairman of Jiangxi Province Wang Lingji seeing them off at the airport. The plane arrived in Nanjing at 4:50 PM, accompanied by Director Yu Jishi and others. The Chairman was wearing a traditional Chinese long gown and mandarin jacket, and carrying a walking stick. The First Lady was wearing a black coat. Upon disembarking, they appeared relaxed and immediately returned to their official residence to rest. According to those close to the Chairman, during his time in Guling, besides enjoying the scenery, he read "The Scholarship Records of the Song and Yuan Dynasties" and "The Complete Works of Zeng Wenzheng," finding it very leisurely. The National Affairs Conference to be held on the 27th will be presided over by the Chairman. The Chairman's mountain retreat lasted nineteen days, coinciding with the Lunar New Year. He summoned several key officials to the mountain for consultation, leading to much speculation. It was widely believed that the Chairman had held important meetings in the mountains to discuss national affairs. In reality, the Chairman spent his days touring the scenic spots and used the peace and quiet to conduct a thorough review of the overall situation. He also drafted major plans for the future, potentially making decisions in the political and economic sectors to clarify the current state of confusion. These decisions will be gradually implemented in the near future.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 26th] The government has developed a comprehensive plan for the overall political and economic strategy in the Central China theater of war, and has drafted two corresponding sets of measures. The political component is divided into the following points: (A) Establishing secure strongholds; (B) Strengthening local organizations; (C) Expanding local armed forces; (D) Enlisting young men from the war zone. The economic component is roughly divided into: (A) Blocking supplies to the war zone; (B) Acquiring supplies from the war zone. These important strategies were passed by the Executive Yuan's provisional meeting on the 26th and will be implemented after being passed by the National Affairs Conference. It is also reported that some key points include issuing grain coupons in combat zones, purchasing grain, allowing farmers to use grain coupons to exchange for other goods in various regions, equivalent to using legal tender. Secondly, young men in bandit suppression areas will be organized into self-defense forces, with detailed regulations.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 26th] The Executive Yuan held a provisional meeting on the 26th, presided over by Zhang Qun. In addition to passing the political and economic strategies for the overall war in Central China and the second phase of demobilization for volunteer intellectual youth, there were two other cases submitted for review: (A) Whether to continue participating in various international conferences this year due to foreign exchange difficulties; (B) The minimum capital requirements for banks and money shops, and restrictions on establishing new banks and money shops in certain areas.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 26th] In order to cooperate with the emergency economic measures and stabilize financial markets in various regions, the Ministry of Finance has repeatedly issued orders restricting the establishment of banks and money shops. It is learned that the Ministry of Finance has recently drafted measures regarding the minimum capital requirements for banks and money shops, and restrictions on establishing new banks and money shops in certain areas. These measures have been submitted to the Executive Yuan for review. The Executive Yuan discussed them at the regular meeting on the 26th, but did not pass them. The Ministry of Finance was instructed to revise them and resubmit them to the Executive Yuan for review. The main point is to increase the capital requirements for various banks and money shops, such as setting the minimum capital for limited liability banks at 20 billion yuan, and the minimum capital for unlimited liability banks at 10 billion yuan, with money shops halved. However, a final decision is pending further revisions by the Ministry of Finance.</p>
<h3>Government Determined to Stabilize Prices Nationwide, Those Spreading Rumors with Evidence to Be Punished by Military Law</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 26th] In recent days, rumors have spread rapidly in Shanghai, causing prices to skyrocket and the market to be in chaos. The severity of the situation surpasses the gold rush of February last year. As a result, markets in Nanjing and other regions have been greatly affected, causing greater suffering to ordinary people. This situation has drawn the attention of officials here. Government officials believe that the current market chaos, with simultaneous surges in gold, currency, grain, yarn, and general merchandise, is clearly the work of unscrupulous merchants manipulating the market. This behavior violates the anti-rebellion laws. The government has decided to immediately dispatch personnel to Shanghai to secretly investigate the situation. They are confident that they have a good understanding of the current situation and will make appropriate decisions. Chairman Chiang has returned to Nanjing from Guling to handle national affairs. The issue of Northeast China is receiving special attention from both the government and the public. They are currently studying fundamental solutions to resolve the crisis. The most urgent need is to transport large forces to provide reinforcements, which has already begun. On the economic front, the government controls ample supplies of grain and yarn. All of this should not lead to economic chaos. In addition to investigating the reasons for the price increases, they will also focus on the spread of rumors. If there is solid evidence, they will be punished by military law to stabilize prices and deter others. According to authoritative sources, the main reason for the current price surge is the excessive number of bizarre rumors, such as those about Chairman Chiang and the military situation in Northeast China, which are all false. Chairman Chiang went to Guling for a short stay to oversee the overall situation. Therefore, we can confidently say that the price surge is undoubtedly manipulated by unscrupulous merchants. The government is determined to take decisive measures and will not be lenient. (The price situation in various regions is published in the left corner of page two)</p>
<h3>Production Improvement Plan for Four Export Commodities</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 26th] The National Economic Council held its 35th regular meeting at 3:00 PM on the 26th, chaired by Wang Yunwu. The secretariat first reported on: (1) Adjusting domestic exchange rates and restricting the transfer of funds to Shanghai and Guangzhou; (2) Revising Article 4 of the regulations on gold jewelry trading by gold shops; (3) The original plan for implementing measures to increase production of materials under the Economic Reform Plan; (4) Reviewing and revising proposals. Subsequently, Huang Yuanbin reported on the economic situation in South China, Liu Zhendong reported on the economic situation in Shandong, and Gu Yulang reported on price developments over the past week. The council then discussed the "Production Improvement Plan for Four Export Commodities: Silk, Tung Oil, Tea, and Wool," drafted by the Ministry of Agriculture and submitted by the Executive Yuan. The plan is largely based on recommendations from the Sino-American Agricultural Survey Team. It was decided to resubmit the plan for review, and Zuo Shunsheng, Chen Qitian, Zhang Jia'ao, Yu Hongjun, Wang Xiaolai, He Haoruo, Huang Yuanbin, Liu Zhendong, and Huo Baoshu were appointed as review committee members, convened by Zuo Shunsheng. The production improvement plan has a three-year target and aims to increase production as follows: (1) Tung oil: Increase production to 60,000 tons in the first year, 80,000 tons in the second year, and 100,000 tons in the third year. (2) Silk: Produce 65,000 dan of raw silk and 8 million yards of silk fabrics for export within three years. (3) Tea: Aim to produce 1.2 million dan within the year. (4) Wool: Hope to produce 220 million pounds of coarse wool for carpets and 480 million pounds of fine wool annually.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 26th] Wang Xiaolai spoke at the National Economic Council on the 26th, commenting on the recent surge in rice prices in Shanghai. Wang said that there are many reasons for the increase in rice prices in Shanghai, but recent restrictions on the rice market have also contributed to the price surge. If the Shanghai rice market could restore a free market, the rice price surge might be slightly eased. However, the issue was not formally discussed at the meeting, so no specific decisions were made.</p>
<h3>Our Country's Export Goods</h3>
<p>Still Need Foreign Ship Assistance for Transportation</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 26th] Ministry of Communications news: Regarding rumors that all of our country's export goods will be transported by domestic ships, the person in charge of the Maritime Administration Department of the Ministry stated that the maritime industry had previously expressed some views on this matter. The Ministry strongly supports the principle of using domestic ships to transport export goods, but because it relates to international trade, there is no absolute prohibition on foreign ships carrying goods. Because our country's export goods are increasing daily and our country's ships are limited, foreign ships are still needed in practice.</p>
<h3>Division of National, Provincial and County Taxes, Ministry of Finance Studying Methods</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 26th] According to constitutional provisions, the division of national, provincial, and county taxes shall be legislated and implemented by the central government. The Ministry of Finance is still carefully studying the draft of the method for dividing national, provincial, and county taxes after the implementation of the constitution. Until a constitutional government is established, the current method of dividing finances in various regions will continue to be implemented during this transition period, without any changes.</p>

<h3>The "Democratic League" Has Long Been Deteriorated, Not a Neutral Political Group, Wu Tiecheng Criticizes Those Who Have Illusions About the "Democratic League"</h3>
<p>[Our Society Nanjing Dispatch on the 26th] Regarding the "Democratic League" fugitive conspiracy members publicly denying its headquarters dissolution order declaration, abandoning the neutral route, participating in Communist bandit armed rebellion and instigating anti-government and anti-American movements, the reporter visited Wu Tiecheng and received his comments: "The 'Democratic League' was initially formed by several political groups. At that time, the majority of the responsible people did have political ambitions and contributed opinions to the government to conduct legitimate political activities. However, since the reorganization in September 1944, it has been transformed from a neutral political group into an outer periphery of the Communist Party, in addition to echoing the Communist Party in political propositions and accepting its subsidies. This caused dissatisfaction among other patriotic members within the organization and eventually led to a split. Last November, in order to actively implement the General Mobilization for Bandit Suppression, the government could not allow the 'Democratic League' to engage in illegal activities on both sides, so it clearly ordered that activities should be stopped immediately. Fortunately, the responsible people of the 'Democratic League' were able to abide by the law and announced the automatic dissolution. People such as Huang Yanpei, Zhang Lan, Luo Longji and Liang Shuming have abandoned political activities and returned to their old careers. The 'Democratic League' meeting in Hong Kong not only attempted to revive the ashes, but also exposed the true face of a small number of members. We carefully examined their so-called political report and declaration of the Third Plenary Session, and it is completely in line with the Communist bandits. I deeply believe that the anti-American and anti-government armed struggle that they advocate will never win the sympathy of patriots. What I cannot understand is that some foreign people still say that the 'Democratic League' is a neutral political group or call it the middle route, and pin their sympathy and hope on it, and even fantasize that the development of the 'Democratic League' and other similar political groups may help solve the China problem. Their lack of political insight is deplorable."</p>
<h3>Dong Guang's Remarks</h3>
<p>Zhang Bojun and Others' Conspiracy in Hong Kong</p>
<p>Treat It as a Communist Bandit Disguised Organization</p>
<p>[Our Dispatch Nanjing, 26th] Dong Guang, Director of the News Bureau of the Executive Yuan, issued a statement regarding the Democratic League members fleeing to Hong Kong to rely on the Communist bandits and openly declaring their participation in the rebellion, stating: "The Democratic League had a history of colluding with the Communist bandits in the past, and the government strongly cracked down on it. Several members of the Democratic League, from its headquarters leader Zhang Lan downwards, such as Luo Longji, Huang Yanpei, Liang Shuming, etc., have remained in various places in the country as usual since the "Democratic League" voluntarily announced its dissolution last winter. However, Zhang Bojun, Shen Junru and others secretly went to Hong Kong to collude with Communist bandits personnel and secretly planned to restore the organization and participate in the Communist bandits rebellion. The tactics of Zhang, Shen and others not only exposed their inextricable relationship with the Communist bandits over the years, but also proved that the "Democratic League" that they are calling for today is no different from the Communist bandits' adopted son. No wonder the treasonous slogans they advocate are exactly the same as the Communist bandits. We should treat their conspiratorial organizations and their secret activities as disguised organizations of the Communist bandits.</p>

<h3>Utilizing US Aid to Develop the Guangdong-Hankou Railway; Guangzhou City to Establish Carriage Factory; Railway Construction Planned from Guangzhou to Macau</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Guangzhou, 26th] Following the announcement of the US$60 million loan to revitalize the Yuehan Railway, locals have expressed excitement. According to the Guangzhou office of the railway, they submitted a restoration plan for over US$40 million to Marshall last year. The United States also sent personnel to inspect the line seven or eight times. Securing at least US$40 million to improve and expand the railway in the future is no longer an issue. The line inspection team for the railway recently completed its work and submitted a detailed supplementary improvement plan to Director Du Zhenyuan. As for the allocation of the loan, plans include using one million to establish a machinery factory, carriage factory, and casting factory in Xicun, Guangzhou, to produce carriages, rails, and other equipment. Another one million will be used to renovate various stations. Song Ziwen hopes to quickly build the Gouyadong branch line. The central government also hopes to increase the daily output of the Yangmeishan coal mine from over 400 tons to 1,000 tons and have the railway promptly repair and take over the branch lines leading to the Zixing coal mines. Furthermore, the section of the Qian-Gui Railway from Xiangtan to Xinhua will also be designated as a branch line of the railway to solve the transportation of various mines. According to unconfirmed reports, Song Ziwen plans to build the Guang'ao Railway from Guangzhou to Macau. Du Zhenyuan has been summoned to Nanjing by Minister Yu of the Ministry of Communications and departed a few days ago. The main task is to decide on the allocation of this loan.</p>
<h3>US Senate Foreign Relations Committee Holds Secret Meeting; Marshall to Explain China Aid Bill</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 25th] Chairman Vandenberg of the US Senate Foreign Relations Committee stated that Marshall will attend a secret meeting of the committee on the 26th to explain the US$570 million China aid plan. Beyond this brief statement, Vandenberg declined to say whether other State Department officials or Wedemeyer were also invited to provide opinions on the China issue. Due to severe criticism from Senate Appropriations Committee Chairman Bridges and Republican Policy Committee Chairman Taft regarding the lack of military assistance in Truman's China aid plan, it is believed that Republican senators will ask Marshall to explain this point. According to information obtained by reporters from reliable sources, Vandenberg wants Congress to clarify the European Recovery Program before dealing with the China aid plan. The debate on the Senate's European Recovery Program will begin on March 1st. If the House Foreign Affairs Committee includes aid to China in the legislation for the European Recovery Program and the House finally passes it, the Senate may be forced to amend its current bill during the debate or in a joint conference of the two houses after both houses of Congress pass the measure.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 25th] The US Department of Agriculture announced today that it has allocated 2,000 long tons (2,240 pounds per ton) of grain seeds as emergency goods to be shipped to China today.

In addition, 50,000 long tons of soybeans are planned to be shipped to the US Army stationed in Japan for the purpose of producing soy milk and soy sauce.</p>
<h3>Progress in Public Security in South China; Rural Decline is Worrying</h3>
<p>Huang Shaohong's Remarks After Returning from a Trip to the South</p>
<p>[Our City News] National Government Committee Member Huang Shaohong, upon returning from a trip to the South, received reporters on the 26th and stated: The public security situation in South China has improved compared to the past. Given sufficient time, it will definitely become more stable. Banditry in South China is not as serious as rumored. Huang recently returned to his hometown for a two-month stay. He said: The impression gained from the trip to the South is that the countryside is declining. No more than two or three out of ten families are adequately fed and clothed. This phenomenon is extremely worrying. The fundamental plan for stabilizing the region lies in stabilizing the economy, ensuring that all people have a way to make a living to avoid resorting to desperate measures. If one seeks superficial solutions instead of addressing the root cause, although temporary effects may be achieved, it will not be a long-term solution. Therefore, I believe that all government measures should prioritize stability. Any measure that significantly affects the livelihood of the people should be thoroughly reviewed, and the preferences of a few should not be allowed to harm the lives of the majority.</p>

<p>Essay</p>
<h3>Parliament and Newspapers</h3>
<p>— Shao Yongsheng</p>
<p>These days, the Shanghai Municipal Council is holding its fifth general meeting. I would like to take this opportunity to discuss the relationship between parliaments and newspapers.</p>
<p>Now that the constitution has been implemented, how do we prevent it from becoming a "constitution on paper"? Now that the democratic political system has been implemented, how do we make local governments at all levels vibrant? How do we guide the public to care about politics when they do not? How do we inspire their interest in politics when they are not interested? The responsibility for most of these tasks falls first on the shoulders of parliaments and newspapers.</p>
<p>As an elected member of parliament in China, one should keenly feel that one's current responsibility is greater than that of members of parliament in any advanced democratic country in the world. Members of parliament should have a spirit of sacrifice, abandoning all personal prejudices to serve the public. In particular, they must eliminate the corrupt practices that have been unavoidable in past parliaments and avoid using parliament to control officials for personal gain.</p>
<p>During this period of democratic political enlightenment, the responsibility for guiding the public to care about politics, enlightening the public's interest in politics, and instructing the public to accurately distinguish and recognize their own interests largely falls on newspapers.</p>
<p>Because newspapers are truly a powerful tool for promoting this work. This tool must be used for the benefit of the public, and those who wield this tool should be people who act solely on justice, without prejudice, and with prudence and fairness. If this tool of propaganda, this guardian of democratic politics, namely the newspaper, is unwilling or unable to fulfill its due responsibilities, then China's democratic future will appear bleak.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Council has been established for a year and a half, has held four general meetings, resolved many cases, and passed two budget and final accounts bills. Its achievements can be said to be considerable. However, observing the general public, most of them can be said to be indifferent to the representatives they elected, the council they formed, the work they are doing, the content of the cases they are discussing, and all the dynamics related to the Municipal Council. Why are the majority of Shanghai citizens so uninterested in municipal facilities, reforms, and their own obligations and rights, which are closely related to them?</p>
<p>Before answering this question and studying its causes, I would like to cite the words of US Ambassador Stuart as a reference: At the end of last year, Ambassador Stuart delivered a "Letter to the Chinese People" at the general meeting of the Journalism Department of Yenching University. The ambassador said: "I have pointed out that China's constitution has now been implemented, but some people doubt whether it can be more effective than a constitution on paper. I believe that this depends on the efforts of the Chinese people. Although most people are too busy with their daily lives to participate in this, intellectuals, non-party members, free men, and journalists should rise up to defend the rights and obligations of Chinese citizens. Relying solely on the government, or solely on government initiatives, cannot make the constitution work effectively and achieve the necessary reforms. However, through freedom of speech, publication, and assembly, as well as the accurate execution of elections, the people can achieve reforms in a democratic way. Many responsible officials in the government also greatly hope for effective reforms." Ambassador Stuart, as a representative of a foreign country, cares for and expects more from China than any Chinese compatriot. He has expressed that he considers himself a Chinese person, and his sympathy for China can be regarded as that of a close Chinese friend. Such a well-intentioned and sincere criticism from a close friend should be valued and reflected upon by all of us.</p>
<p>Thanks to Ambassador Stuart's wise judgment, I, as an elected member of parliament of this city, use my experiences to confirm his deductions, which further shows that his theory is quite accurate.</p>
<p>In fact, the so-called party members, non-party members, intellectuals, free men, and journalists are all included in the elected parliament, the Shanghai Municipal Council. To prevent the constitution from becoming a "constitution on paper," to make local governments at all levels under democratic politics vibrant, to make every citizen interested in politics, to make them care about the work done by parliament and parliamentarians on their behalf, and to cultivate the ability to judge right and wrong to determine what to choose, and then to accurately execute elections to achieve the purpose of assisting and supervising the government to seek the welfare of all citizens. This certainly cannot be achieved overnight, but the responsibility for promoting this work currently falls on the shoulders of parliament and newspapers. This is not only because the parliament includes party members, non-party members, intellectuals, free men, and journalists, but also because the council can concentrate and exert the rights granted to the people by the constitution. And newspapers are even more important tools for arousing people's attention, guiding people's concern, inspiring people's interest, and instructing people's accurate judgment.</p>
<p>In fact, in the promotion of democratic politics, the responsibility borne by newspapers, as well as the effects they receive, are much greater than those of parliament.</p>
<p>To make the government vibrant, the parliament must be vibrant; to make the parliament vibrant, the people must have familiarity and interest in the parliament and politics; to make the people interested, they must rely on the encouragement and enlightenment of newspapers. At the same time, both parliament and government rely on the supervision of newspapers.</p>
<p>If the citizens of Shanghai are truly indifferent and uninterested in the Municipal Council, the organ that represents them in exercising their powers and undertaking their obligations, it is not the best phenomenon. But this may be a phenomenon that is unavoidable in the era of democratic enlightenment. To study the reasons, it is best to review the past facts. In fact, the parliament itself and the newspapers are both responsible for improving this phenomenon.</p>
<p>There is no need to talk about the past. After the implementation of the constitution, we should think about whether newspapers can do something to improve citizens' concern, interest, and discernment in parliamentary politics. Here, I would like to publicly discuss a plan that I have long cherished in my heart.</p>
<p>Every time I see the Municipal Council holding a general meeting, the number of people in the audience is sparse, sometimes even empty. This time the phenomenon has progressed, and the audience has been quite lively for the past three days. But in any case, I seem to feel the sadness that the council is being abandoned by the citizens. The councilors debate on the stage, expressing their views, only for the councilors themselves to hear. In addition, only the newspaper reporters are concentrating and writing diligently. What is seen in the newspaper tomorrow, either due to space limitations or because there are too many proposals, is all brief and not detailed. The citizens cannot know the details of the debate at the time regarding the opinions expressed by each councilor on each proposal, whether positive or negative. Therefore, they cannot understand the importance of the process from debate to conclusion to stimulate their attention, concern, and judgment. Moreover, each proposal has its own unique nature and factors, and it is necessary to have a preliminary understanding of the outline beforehand. Therefore, it is no wonder that citizens are not very interested based solely on the little bit of information recorded in the newspapers. The way to remedy this is to make as much use of radio broadcasting as possible to send the voices of the people's representatives into the ears of the people.</p>
<p>Although the council now has broadcasting equipment, which is rebroadcast by a radio station - Xindu Radio Station (frequency 1330), the preparatory work is still insufficient. Because without the cooperation of newspaper offices and coordination with newspapers, I am afraid that few citizens will still listen to the council's broadcasts (I am afraid that few people know that there are broadcasts when the council is in session). Moreover, when listening, it is difficult to find clues, so the effect is naturally minimal. I think at least the following methods should be adopted.</p>
<p>The Municipal Council should announce the already scheduled agenda in the newspaper one day in advance (as much as possible to avoid temporary changes after the agenda is scheduled). The important proposals should be briefly explained so that citizens can understand the importance of each proposal and then choose the proposals they are concerned about and interested in, and listen to the debate of the councilors and the results at that time. In addition, the relay broadcasting station should also strive to increase the number of stations. The main thing is the cooperation of newspaper offices. I sincerely hope that the newspaper offices will also participate in and assist in the work of using radio reports. On the one hand, they should encourage citizens to listen to the council's broadcasts. On the other hand, the newspaper offices should cooperate with the council and the radio station to send reporters to serve as broadcasting reporters, in the same way as stage broadcasting reporters. Before the discussion of each important proposal begins, make a brief introduction, and after the debate ends, report on the dynamics, trends, results, and atmosphere of the debate on the proposal. If the description is made in concise and lively words, it will be able to arouse great interest among the audience and citizens. It is even more necessary to install temporary loudspeakers in public places or in front of newspaper offices so that citizens who do not have radios can listen. This is a training course for the public to care about politics. Every newspaper office is worth using and should use it! I believe that the reporters will also feel interested and willing to work for this great and meaningful work of promoting democratic politics. This is equivalent to an active newspaper, with reporters using their mouths instead of pens. The arguments made by the councilors are directly sent into the ears of the citizens, and the citizens will unconsciously feel the importance of municipal administration and its relationship with themselves, and increase their degree of concern and interest. Only then will the citizens cherish their votes in the next election, and will not easily give up and despise the election, and will ultimately be of some help to the so-called promotion of good people in politics. The voices of public reason and justice, and the distorted and selfish arguments, after being considered in the hearts of tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands of people, thought about in their minds, and expressed in their mouths, the people and the newspapers will be in step, and fairness will be in the hearts of the people, and then the true value and true authority of public opinion will be revealed!</p>
<p>The councilors will also inevitably do their best and think more about the interests of the majority of the people, and express their most quintessential arguments. The atmosphere in the council will be more enthusiastic than in the past, and the spirit of the council will be more brilliant than in the past, and boring arguments and boring reversals will be reduced. As for those who want to use the power of the council to control officials for personal gain, there should certainly not be any now, and there may not be any in the future, and at the very least they will have some scruples.</p>
<p>The reason why I have repeatedly stated this is because our country's democracy is in its enlightenment era. At the beginning, the people's representatives should all have good habits and establish good customs. What's more, Shanghai's material conditions are good enough to do this, and it does not require much expense, but the effects and gains are incalculably large. The original broadcasting method of the Municipal Council is not sufficient, and not many citizens know about it. The agenda discussion date and radio frequency are not announced in the newspaper in advance, and only one broadcasting station is too few, and there are no reporters to make explanations (this is the most important point). Therefore, the effect of the council's broadcasts without the participation of newspaper offices and the coordination of newspapers is not great, and it cannot arouse much attention from the people. I hope that this shallow article of mine can arouse the attention of the authorities of the newspaper offices, and I warmly hope that the newspaper offices will unite to organize this matter.</p>
<p>This move must be supervised and organized by a third party other than the council and the government. Who is more suitable to undertake this task than the propaganda weapon and the guardian of democratic politics - the newspaper?</p>

We have discussed the issue of voting in the upcoming National Assembly meeting. As for the presidential candidate, Mr. Chiang is naturally praised by the whole country. As for the vice-presidential candidate, there are two very simple conditions: (1) If the President is from the South, the Vice President should be from the North; (2) If the President is a military man, the Vice President should be a civilian. Therefore, after discussing with Mr. Du, we two have decided to cast our votes for Mr. Yu in the upcoming Vice Presidential election."

<h3>Northeastern People's Relief Association Offers Suggestions to Save the Critical Situation</h3>
<p>(Continued from page one) (1) Appoint Northeastern generals, give them real power, and establish a force of more than ten armies. (2) Increase troops and ensure the Yu-Pan Corridor. (3) Find an opportunity to use the main force to break into the bandit area and conduct guerrilla warfare behind enemy lines. General Ma Zhanshan still retains influence in the Northeast because many of his former subordinates are in the bandit area. Yesterday's reception was hosted by Xu Chengjia, who stated that the association is "a mass organization of Northeastern youth, with a purely public-opinion standpoint with no party affiliation." The report believes that the severity of the situation in the Northeast is caused by the following failures: (1) Blind faith in diplomacy, (2) Misunderstanding of peace talks, (3) Inability to effectively utilize puppet troops and mass forces, (4) Lack of smooth handling of defectors, (5) Lack of methods for organizing and training the masses, (6) Disconnection between officials and the people, (7) Intellectual youth are emotional.

<h3>Price Trends in Various Regions: Beiping Reaches New Peak; Price Hikes in Guangzhou Gradually Stabilizing</h3>
<p>Suzhou County Government Abandons Price Controls</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 26th] News of the price hikes in Shanghai has reached the capital, creating even greater turbulence in the Beiping market. Beiping prices have been soaring for days, reaching a new peak on the 26th, setting an unprecedented record, with prices changing multiple times a day, creating a chaotic situation. Gold, banknotes, grain, cloth, and groceries have seen the most drastic increases. The black market price of gold has jumped again and again, with pawnshops only buying and not selling, in a semi-closed state. Negotiated grain prices this morning rose to 300,000 yuan per dan (unit of weight), foreign-grown cooked rice at 2.8 million per dan, black market cooked rice at 2.7 million, yellow cooked rice at 2.5 million, superior cooked rice at 2.4 million, flour at 1.33 million per bag. Cotton cloth prices varied, with transactions light, each item increasing by 100,000 to 200,000, and even 500,000 to 600,000 yuan. Imported groceries have been soaring, with cigarettes, matches, soap, and kerosene all experiencing runaway price increases.</p>
<p>Guangzhou [Our Guangzhou Dispatch, 26th] The situation here has gradually stabilized on the 26th. In the financial market, the Hong Kong dollar has fallen sharply, closing at only 520 on the 25th, with no improvement today. Grain prices have also gradually eased. The Grain Management Association is selling off large quantities of stored rice. Grain merchants, in order to help the government suppress the chaotic situation, have also decided to sell off all their stored grain. The Grain Control Office has also notified citizens that if rice merchants do not sell at the limited price, they can report them to the police for investigation. Therefore, the momentum of grain price increases has gradually slowed down. Furthermore, to stabilize the financial situation, the Guangzhou Headquarters convened an emergency meeting on the 26th with relevant departments. In addition to ordering the military police and anti-smuggling agencies to strictly investigate the flow of speculative funds, a special court will be established to try illegal speculators who disrupt the market according to military law.</p>
<p>Suzhou [Our Suzhou Dispatch, 26th] Prices here are difficult to suppress. Rice, flour, wheat, vegetable oil, sugar, yarn, silk, cigarettes, and local specialties have all risen, creating a general atmosphere of price increases, causing widespread anxiety throughout the city. Although the market price of rice has been raised to 2.3 million yuan per dan, it is still far from the actual price, resulting in transactions in the market being conducted in secret, with people having to resort to the black market to obtain rice. Both grain merchants and the public feel inconvenienced. The Suzhou County Government has resolutely decided to cancel all price controls from the 27th, with industry associations negotiating prices themselves. County Magistrate Wang Jiefo has also issued four orders to the Social Affairs Section: (1) Crack down on non-merchants using speculative funds for transactions; (2) Investigate the inventory of each store; (3) The daily sales volume of each store must be registered individually; (4) Rice and flour prices must not be higher than those in Shanghai and Wuxi, otherwise, those violating this will be detained and interrogated by the military law office. It is reported that the price of white rice on the 27th has been negotiated by the Grain Industry Association and submitted to the County Government for approval, with a market price of 2.7 million yuan per dan, and a slightly higher profit of 100,000 yuan per dan for retail sales.</p>

<h3>Communist Coup in Czechoslovakia Threatens People's Freedom; US, UK, and France Strongly Condemn; US May Impose Economic Sanctions on Czechoslovakia</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] New York, 26th Broadcast: Washington News, the United States, Britain, and France issued a statement accusing the Communist Party of the coup in Czechoslovakia, which constitutes a "disguised dictatorship" and threatens the existence of the principles of freedom, which will have extremely adverse effects on the people of Czechoslovakia. The statement was initiated by the United States, and was formally announced after consultations with Britain and France in the past 24 hours.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 26th] According to well-informed sources here, the U.S. Department of State will present a severe protest note to the Gottwald government of Czechoslovakia. The source suggested that the United States may take economic sanctions against Czechoslovakia.</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 25th] Government sources said that due to the Communist seizure of power in Czechoslovakia, the United States may further reduce credit loans to Czechoslovakia, or stop exports to Czechoslovakia, especially machinery. U.S. officials believe that the U.S. may not sever diplomatic relations with Czechoslovakia, as they want to maintain a "window behind the Iron Curtain" in Prague.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, New York, 25th] After the Communist Party seized power in Czechoslovakia, most Americans sympathize with the brave and melancholy people of Czechoslovakia. As there are about one million American citizens of Czech descent in the United States, and the Republic of Czechoslovakia was born in the United States after the last war, great importance is attached here to reports of the new developments in Czechoslovakia.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 25th] Political figures here pointed out that although the new Czech cabinet is still a coalition cabinet, all important positions have been monopolized by the Communist Party. The general election to be held next month can serve as an effective test to prove whether this coalition cabinet is merely a facade. It is also expected here that the Communist Party may follow the example of Hungary and Poland, and propose a list of candidates based on the government group. The Communist Party now controls all domestic security in Czechoslovakia, with the Ministries of Interior and Justice both occupied by the Communist Party. Therefore, Communist Party members will also serve as presiding judges in the trial of those accused of conspiracy in the so-called coup.</p>
<h3>Czechoslovak Communist Party Seizes Power; Nationwide Purge Campaign Carried Out</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] London, 26th Broadcast: Prague News, senior officials said that President Beneš bowed to the Communist Party to avoid bloodshed.

<p>[Reuters, Prague, 26th] Prague is very quiet today. Generally, it is believed that the political crisis that lasted for a week has ended, and the Communist Party has achieved complete victory.

<p>[United Press, Prague, 26th] On the first day of the new regime of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia, a purge campaign was carried out in various departments and organizations. Fourteen people were purged from the Ministry of Transport, more than seven from the Ministry of Post and Telecommunications, fifteen from the Ministry of Domestic Trade, and some from the Ministry of Education. The purge is not limited to various departments of the government. In addition, purges are also being carried out in the councils of various districts and cities, political parties, social organizations, state-owned enterprises, and factories.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Prague, 25th] Of the 24 members of the new cabinet announced by Gottwald, the Communist Party occupies 12 seats, and the Social Democratic Party that supports the Communist Party also occupies 4 seats. Therefore, the Communist Party has absolute majority control in the new cabinet. The Communist Party occupies 114 seats in the National Assembly, which has 300 members. Adding the 39 seats of the Social Democratic Party that supports the Communist Party can ensure them a majority in the National Assembly.</p>

<h3>US Formally Proposes Establishing a Five-Power Committee to Review the Situation in the Holy Land</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Lake Success, 25th] The chief U.S. representative, Austin, formally proposed today in the Security Council that the five major powers (China, the United Kingdom, the United States, France, and the Soviet Union) jointly find a solution to the Palestine problem, examine whether the situation in the Holy Land constitutes a threat to peace, and consult with the Arab, Jewish, and British parties on methods to implement the UN Partition Plan. At the same time, the United States expressed opposition to the proposal by Colombia to convene a special session of the UN General Assembly to reconsider the Partition Plan. However, according to British sources, the British government is doubtful about agreeing to consultations between the five major powers and the parties involved, as the United Kingdom is scheduled to withdraw from Palestine before August 1 and will not participate in the implementation of the Partition Plan.</p>
<h3>British Army Commander Publishes Report on Service in the Far East</h3>
<p>Full Text of 200,000 Words</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 26th] The report of the British Army Commander in the battles of Malaya and the Dutch East Indies at the beginning of the Pacific War, with a full text of 200,000 words, was published today. It shows that at the beginning of the Japanese offensive in December 1941, the United Kingdom was completely unprepared for a full-scale war in the Far East. In Malaya, the troops were not well-trained, tanks were completely absent, and air support was extremely weak. The Japanese army, on the other hand, had 300 tanks, strong air force cover, and its attacking troops were well-trained assault troops.

<h3>New Riots in South Korea, Similar in Nature to the Situation in Early Last Month; Small Assembly Yet to Vote on South Korean Elections</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Seoul, 26th] U.S. military authorities announced today that the Communist Party has instigated riots again, opposing the United Nations Korean Election Supervisory Commission. As a result, 56 Korean people and one police officer were killed, and 13 people were seriously injured. Each group of rioters ranged from 50 to 1,000 people. In addition to attacking police posts in various parts of southern Korea, they also destroyed bridges, cut power lines, and set up obstacles on the railway tracks. This matter is similar in nature to the riots on the 7th of last month, when 47 people died. The Korean Independence Memorial Day on March 1 is approaching, and public sentiment is very excited.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Lake Success, 25th] Norwegian representative Mowinckel proposed today in the United Nations Small Assembly to convene a special session of the United Nations General Assembly to re-discuss the Korean issue. He stated that if the United Nations agency disregards Soviet opposition and hastily implements the resolutions on the Korean issue, it may create a situation similar to that in Palestine. The Small Assembly is scheduled to continue its meeting tomorrow. A vote on the U.S. proposal to instruct the resident mission in Korea to do its best to conduct elections has not been taken. The Philippines, India, Dominica, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, Thailand, France, and Uruguay all supported the U.S. proposal. Mowinckel also stated, "If one of the United States and the Soviet Union withdraws its occupation forces, a civil war may occur in Korea, and the United Nations agency may face the question of whether to send troops to maintain order. In order to resolve the Korean issue satisfactorily, we must find a way to urge the United States and the Soviet Union to reach an agreement, but to reach such an agreement, we must consider whether it is worthwhile to convene a special session of the General Assembly." Before the adjournment of the Small Assembly, Philippine representative Romulo advocated the release of Korean political prisoners so that elections could be conducted in a free atmosphere.</p>

<h3>Turkey Strengthens Defense Capabilities; No Change in Relations with the Soviet Union</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Istanbul, 25th] Turkish Foreign Minister Sadak told reporters here that half of Turkey's national budget is spent on national defense, which proves that Turkey is the most vulnerable to external pressure among European countries. Under this psychology, Turkey has strengthened its national defense without hesitation. The world knows that Turkey has never had aggressive ambitions towards anyone. He also said, "I am convinced that 1948 is one of the most serious years since the war. However, the possibility of a third world war is still low." Speaking of the issue with the Soviet Union, he said, "There has never been any change in Turkey's relations with the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union has requested our approval for its new ambassador to Turkey, and we have appointed a professor of socioeconomics as the new ambassador."</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Moscow, 25th] The diplomatic commentator of "Pravda" cited the public statement of the Turkish Ambassador to Egypt as proof that "Turkey has strengthened its troops on the Soviet-Turkish border after receiving aid from Britain and the United States."

<p>Let Us Drink to the Meeting of Allied Forces in Berlin</p>
<p>After meeting Stalin, a meeting was held immediately. During the break, I insisted on talking to Molotov and reiterated the arguments I had presented to Stalin regarding a meeting of the leaders of the three nations in Basra. Molotov asked me what should be resolved now in the plan for international cooperation I mentioned. I repeated many suggestions to him, suggestions I had made more than once since my arrival in Moscow.</p>
<p>Molotov said that an agreement should be reached regarding these plans. After thinking for a moment, he suddenly said:</p>
<p>"Isolation is almost something your country has discarded, isn't it, Mr. Secretary of State?"</p>
<p>I replied, "Yes, indeed. And isolation is almost something your country has discarded, isn't it, Mr. Minister?"</p>
<p>Molotov smiled and admitted that it was indeed so.</p>
<p>I said, "After the war, if you wish, you can follow isolationism and swallow up your neighbors. But you will abandon this approach. When I was young, I knew a bully in Tennessee. He often used his bullying to strong-arm others and gain something, but in the end, he had no friends in the world."</p>
<p>On October 28th, the President notified me that he expected to travel to North Africa soon and would have to leave Washington on November 9th. (This was to attend the Roosevelt-Churchill-Chiang Kai-shek conference in Cairo). He said he hoped I would keep my original plan, which was to return to the country on November 7th, because he and I had to talk before he left.</p>
<p>He suggested that if Stalin thought it impossible to meet with him, the Marshal should at least fly as far as Basra for one day. This was extremely important. For the rest of the time, the President hoped that Stalin could let Molotov attend, and hold meetings with Churchill and him.</p>
<p>The next day, I replied to the President that I was staying in Moscow longer than expected and would be happy to meet him on the east coast of the Atlantic. I said that Stalin was unlikely to go further than Tehran, and this indication was becoming more and more obvious, and I doubted whether Molotov would be sent as a substitute, because he was not a military man.</p>
<p>Two days later, I telegraphed the President that four of our group had contracted malignant malaria on the way to Moscow and could not return, so I thought it was not advisable to come to North Africa to wait for him, exposing myself to malaria, dysentery and similar diseases, because I had not been immunized. The President agreed to postpone the trip and meet me in the United States. So I telegraphed again, saying that I would fly back to the United States via the Pacific Ocean, instead of taking a cruiser.</p>
<p>The Catherine Hall in the Kremlin was the venue for the banquet hosted by Marshal Stalin for the delegation on the last day of the conference - the night of October 30th. This was my first social event since attending the conference.</p>
<p>As soon as I arrived in Moscow, I told Molotov that, given my health, I could not attend to social activities and work at the same time. At first, he didn't seem to believe me, and kept inviting me to see plays and attend banquets. When I firmly refused, he seemed quite touched. Later, someone told me that this made him believe in the sincerity of my purpose, because I had traveled to Moscow despite my poor health in order to help lay the foundation for a better post-war world.</p>
<p>I sat to Stalin's right. This gave me an excellent opportunity to talk to him for a long time during the meal and entertainment. I tried to use it to discuss our current and future relations, knowing that this was my last chance before leaving Moscow. I somewhat indirectly induced him to express his opinions.</p>
<p>Stalin was in a very good mood. No matter what topic was discussed, he seemed to take it into account and try to make me more aware of his current and future position. At the beginning of the conversation, he said, "You have had a successful meeting." I immediately replied that everything should be attributed to him, and said that he had approved his great country to take decisive steps to join a world plan based on cooperation with Britain and the United States. This seemed to please him very much. Throughout the conversation, he expressed unconditional support for broad international cooperation, including military, political and economic aspects, for the sake of peace.</p>
<p>I then presented to Stalin in the most forceful way possible the need for him to participate in the personal cooperation and leadership between the President and the Prime Minister. But on the point of meeting them in Basra, he firmly stated his conclusion, which was that he could not currently leave his tense military situation. He said we should believe that he was very sincere about this.</p>
<p>He then said that he could send Molotov to replace him, because under Soviet law, he was really the second person in the government and could take his place in his absence. He asked me what I thought of this idea.</p>
<p>I immediately replied that, of course, if he felt he absolutely couldn't go, then Molotov would be a good representative. But in the minds of the President and myself, the whole point was that if Stalin himself could go, it would have a profound psychological impact on the world. I said that if possible, I would still implore him to go himself.</p>
<p>I got nothing out of this. His conclusion seemed to be decided. I guessed that he had already discussed it with his advisors, and they felt that the military situation, or the needs of the conference, had not yet reached the point where he could leave. I decided not to urge him on this point any further, because doing so would not only be useless, but would also harm our purpose.</p>
<p>But then he made an extremely important statement. He clearly and unequivocally stated that when the Allied forces defeated Germany, the Soviet Union would participate in defeating Japan, which surprised me very much.</p>
<p>Stalin raised this topic entirely of his own accord, although he may have remembered my conversation with Ambassador Litvinov on this topic. He finally said that I could inform President Roosevelt of this very confidentially. I expressed my heartfelt thanks to him.</p>
<p>The Marshal's explanation of his determination was very straightforward. He said it very forcefully, not at all out of someone's plea, and he did not ask for any thanks.</p>
<p>At the Yalta Conference in 1943, Stalin provided the President with the same promise in writing, but at that time it was after the President agreed to make many territorial concessions to the Soviet Union in Asia, including the Kuril Islands and part of Sakhalin Island. I had resigned in November 1944, so I don't know what changes in the situation may have made these concessions necessary - but when Stalin offered me the promise to convey to the President, it was without any hesitation.</p>
<p>During the meal, toasts were repeatedly raised. Stalin and I drank red wine, while many guests preferred to drink vodka. Our military attaché in Moscow, Major General Deane, was the focus of attention. When he thanked Stalin for toasting the American armed forces, he suggested a toast to the day when British, American and Soviet troops would meet in Berlin. Stalin stood up from the chair next to me, went around the table to clink glasses with him, which was an honor only Deane received.</p>
<p>As we left the dining table, before going to another room to watch a movie, Stalin led me and two or three other people to a room next door for a few minutes. He began spontaneously, in the most satirical tone, to talk about the rumors that had circulated before about the possibility of a separate peace between the Soviet Union and Germany. I said that anyone who understood the Soviet people and their relationship with Germany in this war knew that they would not make a separate peace with Germany. He heartily agreed with this.</p>
<p>Our host then led us to watch a movie, which depicted the arduous battles fought by Red Army guerrillas in Siberia during the 1918 revolution to resist the perfidious Japanese. This film was made in 1938, and when it was publicly screened in Moscow, it aroused a strong protest from the Japanese ambassador. Now, there was no attempt to hide the purpose of choosing this film, and it had a double meaning, especially after Stalin had just told me that the Soviet Union would participate in the war against Japan.</p>
<p>After the movie, there was a concert, and I didn't leave until the end, which was around 2 a.m. - although we were scheduled to take off at 5 a.m. to return home. The concert was performed by the most famous Soviet musicians, and Stalin seemed quite pleased that I stayed there from beginning to end.</p>
<p>When we said goodbye, I was deeply impressed by Stalin. After saying some usual farewell words, he shook hands with me and said "Goodbye" in Russian. Then he walked away from me for three or four steps, suddenly turned back and shook hands with me a second time, for quite a long time, but without saying a word. I thought to myself that any American who had Stalin's personality and way of dealing with people could also achieve a very high position in my own country.</p>
<p>After I returned to the embassy, I sent two telegrams to the President. I thought that Stalin's determination about Japan was so confidential that I sent half of it to the President using naval code and the other half using army code. Because I believed that the British Foreign Office sometimes leaked important information more easily than I thought it should, I let the President convey this message to Churchill himself.</p>
<p>Regarding the planned Roosevelt-Churchill-Stalin conference, I notified the President that Stalin clearly agreed 100% in words and deeds with this new trend of international cooperation in every aspect, which had been indicated in the Four-Nation Declaration, but at the same time, he was currently unwilling to give in on meeting with the President and the Prime Minister outside of Tehran. Because of the continuing stalemate between the President and Stalin, I wanted to make Mr. Roosevelt's mind more inclined to Tehran, because I believed that Stalin would not go to Basra. After considerable consideration, the President agreed.</p>
<p>As I flew back home, I felt deeply that major achievements had been made in Moscow. We had agreed to establish an international organization, which later became the United Nations. The Soviet Union agreed to become a member of this organization and cooperate closely with Western countries in many other aspects. We reached agreements on policies towards Italy and Austria. We had established the European Advisory Commission and the Italian Advisory Commission. We had exchanged many views on how to deal with Germany after the war, the attitude towards France, and the economic policies that should be followed after the war. In addition, outside of the conference, Stalin also agreed that once Hitler was defeated, the Soviet Union would participate in the war against Japan.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the Soviet Union had never mentioned the issue of resolving post-war borders, which had greatly troubled us in the past year.</p>
<p>We flew back to our country via Tehran, Cairo, Algiers, Marrakesh, Dakar, Fortalaleza (Brazil) and Buturiko, without any accidents along the way. When we approached Brazil, we encountered a tropical cyclone, and after two hours of extremely uncomfortable flight, several of us were quite embarrassed, but it didn't seem to affect me. Whenever we stopped, I exchanged telegrams with the President, and was very happy to learn that he had decided to meet with Stalin in Tehran.</p>
<p>When we arrived at Washington Airport on November 10th, the President was there to welcome us. He was accompanied by a congressional delegation.</p>
<p>On the way to the White House and in the conversation the next morning, I told the President about the important matters of the Moscow conference. He was more interested in discussing the upcoming Cairo and Tehran conferences. He seemed to look forward to meeting with Stalin with the fervor of a child, and particularly earnestly asked me to tell him about my personal impressions of the Marshal. A few hours later, the President set off for these two historic conferences.</p>

<h3>Blitz Operation Cracks Down on Foreign Exchange Black Market Organization, Seizing Forty-One Businesses and Arresting Fifty-Eight People, Many Prominent Guangdong-Chaozhou Speculation Tycoons</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] The municipal authorities and financial management authorities, acting on secret orders from the highest authorities, together with the administrative office of the municipal police department, the economic police and the Flying Fortress, in forty-six groups, took swift action yesterday morning at 11:00 a.m. to search and arrest the organizers and major speculators secretly operating black market gold, banknotes, and foreign exchange organizations throughout the city. By 5:00 p.m., fifty-eight people had been detained, many of whom were prominent Guangdong-Chaozhou tycoons. The trading funds seized and frozen amounted to an initial estimate of over three thousand yuan. According to the person in charge of planning this operation, who spoke to reporters yesterday: Since the city cracked down on the main black market gold banknote organization on the ninth of last month, the market situation had stabilized for a time. However, during the Lunar New Year, some speculative elements became active again, setting up private radio stations and secretly engaging in black market foreign exchange and gold banknote transactions. It was then decided to send personnel to infiltrate their secret organization to record their transactions at any time. As of recently, it has been found that there are as many as four hundred such firms in the city. Their operating methods are mainly based on Hong Kong currency. When the Hong Kong currency decreases, gold banknotes increase, and prices also increase. When gold banknotes and prices increase together, the Hong Kong currency follows suit and increases again, returning to the path of the Hong Kong currency decreasing again, cyclical manipulation, causing prices to skyrocket. The information was immediately secretly reported to the highest authorities for instructions, and at the same time, the second phase of action began, which was to investigate the most important of these four hundred firms, a total of forty-one firms. The daily Hong Kong currency, black market transactions, and stock transactions involve amounts ranging from 4.5 billion to 230 billion legal tender. Subsequently, a secret order was obtained from the highest authorities, and action was taken yesterday to arrest the organizers of these forty-one firms, who are also the troublemakers in the gold banknote and stock markets, totaling fifty-eight people (list attached). It is possible to enter the next step from today onwards, and gradually investigate the remaining three hundred firms. All the suspects are currently detained by the city police department, and the economic section of the administrative office is responsible for interrogating them overnight, and the seized account books are also being reviewed by the section in groups to ensure that no one is wrongly accused or let go. All large checks and gold banknotes have been handed over to the Financial Management Bureau for processing. When the city police department began the arrests, the market was rising sharply due to various rumors, but after the organizers of the black market firms were caught in the afternoon, the market situation changed, and the black market Hong Kong currency disappeared after 4:00 p.m.</p>

<p>Talk by the Director of the Financial Management Bureau</p>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] Li Lixia, Director of the Financial Management Bureau of this city, made the following statement to the press at the Central Bank at 6:00 p.m. yesterday: Recently, the black market for gold banknotes in this city has shown fluctuations again. The reasons are: (1) Due to the sharp rise in daily necessities such as rice and cotton cloth. (2) The repeated surge in telegraphic transfers shows that funds are fleeing from this city to Hong Kong, and that someone in this city is constantly speculating on Hong Kong currency. According to the investigation of this bureau, there are many institutions in this city that operate Hong Kong currency, similar to the Minye Bureau in Guangzhou. Most of them use the names of companies and firms as attachment, set up private radio stations, and use codes to transmit daily transaction flows and market fluctuations, and contact Hong Kong. The Central Bank has long investigated these firms and personnel engaged in black market Hong Kong currency. After the establishment of the Financial Management Bureau, more close attention was paid to them. Based on code searches, the bureau separately intercepted and recorded the incoming and outgoing communications. More than forty of the largest and most influential firms have been identified, and detailed lists, addresses, telephone numbers, etc. have been sent to the Municipal Police Department for a comprehensive search starting today (26th). From a financial point of view, the recent fluctuations in commodity prices in Shanghai are actually the result of the influx of funds and cash into Shanghai. According to past experience, commodity prices in this city inevitably fluctuate around the New Year and the Lunar New Year. This is due to: (1) More withdrawals by military and government agencies. (2) More business remittances. The National Bank is paying close attention to the flow of funds to Shanghai and is trying to find a way out for the funds. In the past ten days, the National Bank has injected an average of 300 billion yuan into the money market every day, so the money market has become tighter, which is helpful in stabilizing commodity prices. However, the recent fluctuations in commodity prices are mostly cyclical, and after this cyclical period, commodity prices can return to stability.</p>
<p>Orders to Suspend the Business of More Than Ten Securities Firms</p>
<p>[Also reported] The commissioners of the Exchange Supervisor's Office have separately investigated and found more than thirty illegal firms on Sichuan Road, Jiangxi Road, Central Road, and in major buildings. The office has sent letters to the police department to order them to suspend their business. Among them, more than ten firms are suspected of violating the Exchange Law and have been transferred to the District Prosecutor's Office for questioning. According to Article 53 of the Exchange Law, those who engage in buying and selling can be sentenced to imprisonment for up to one year.</p>
<h3>Director Wu Appeals to the City Council: Two Major Crises Require Immediate Solutions - Most Factories Will Be Unable to Sustain Themselves - Failing to Aid Refugees Will Create Security Problems</h3>
<p>[Our Own Report] The fifth session's fourth meeting of the City Council was convened yesterday afternoon. First, Director Zhao of the Public Works Bureau answered questions from the previous day's meeting regarding inquiries to the Public Utilities Bureau, and then Director Zhao responded. The fourth meeting's agenda then commenced with work reports from the heads of the Civil Affairs, Police Affairs, and Social Affairs Bureaus. District chiefs and two representatives from the District People's Congresses attended to report. The question and answer session for the Civil, Police, and Social Affairs Bureaus must be postponed until next Monday (March 1st). This morning and tomorrow morning from 9:00 AM to 12:00 PM, and afternoon from 2:00 PM to 6:00 PM will be dedicated to review sessions for each group.</p>
<p>During yesterday's meeting, when Social Affairs Director Wu Kaixian reported on his administration, in addition to explaining the main points, he urgently appealed, presenting two major pressing issues for the City Council to consider: (1) Due to price fluctuations, many factories will inevitably be unable to sustain themselves this year, leading to worker unemployment, which is a matter of utmost concern. (2) Refugee shelters currently house over 5,000 people, and tens of thousands more receive assistance. The winter relief effort is scheduled to end on April 15th, but based on the circumstances, it cannot be terminated. If continued relief efforts are not devised for the hundreds of thousands of refugees in Shanghai, security problems will certainly arise. Director Wu particularly emphasized the severity of these two major crises, urging the City Council to quickly find a solution.</p>
<p>The comprehensive administration report included: (1) Food Administration: Last year, rice prices fluctuated, experiencing a sudden surge in December, which was unexpected. Logically, with the establishment of the new marketplace, there should have been no fluctuations, but the main reason was insufficient military rice. After requesting the Ministry of Food to stop purchasing military rice, the price, once raised, did not easily decrease. Previously, fluctuations were suppressed by releasing rice into the market, but this year the situation is different. The price in rice-producing areas is high, so releasing rice had limited effect. As for the comprehensive rationing plan for this year, half will be supplied by the US Aid to China Association, with the Ministry of Food and the municipal government each bearing one-quarter. This way, each person can be allocated two *dou* of rice per month, resolving the issue. The source of rice for the city was from purchases made in Wuhu, Hankou, Wuxi, Songjiang, and other places starting in late November last year, which were then stored in preparation. The reason why US rice cannot be priced too low is that the proceeds from the rice sales will be used for relief efforts. Also, Americans are aware of the "scalpers" in China; if the price is too low, scalpers will emerge and buy up the rice. The decision to implement rice rationing on March 1st means that, while the price may only seem 5% cheaper on that day, it will be much more cost-effective by the end of March. (2) The purpose of establishing the People's Food Allocation Committee is to reduce the burden on the market and prevent the cost of living index from rising due to high rice prices. From June to the end of last year, a total of 700,000 *dan* of rice were allocated to vocational workers, industrial workers, students, civilians, and the United States. Workers' rice accounted for only 241,000 *dan*, and civilian rice for 161,000 *dan*. Starting in September, coal briquettes were also distributed, with a total of 610,000 *dan* distributed in two phases, and distribution is now starting again. Furthermore, in order to distribute oil, loans were borrowed from the Central Bank to purchase raw materials from Qingdao and other places to avoid affecting prices in the city. The government incurred losses of 50 trillion on rice distribution, and the oil funds were personally borrowed from the Central Bank, with debts reaching 680 billion. From the government's standpoint, this can be considered as doing right by the people. (3) Labor Administration: Advocates for promoting labor welfare to eliminate class struggle. The establishment of cooperatives in factories has achieved considerable success, but it is still insufficient and must be promoted as much as possible. (4) Relief Efforts: It is planned to greatly expand these efforts this year, with funding allocated from the US rice funds. The proceeds from the sale of US rice could reach 4 trillion, of which 2.5 trillion is designated for social economy and 2.5 trillion for health and relief. Shanghai's request for several hundred billion should not be a problem.</p>
<h3>Automatic Adjustment of Public Utility Prices Becomes Focus of Councilors' Inquiries - Doubts Regarding Gas and Electricity Fines and Custodial Procedures - Director Zhao Provides Point-by-Point Explanations to the Assembly</h3>
<p>Among the City Councilors' inquiries to the various municipal bureaus yesterday, those directed at the Public Utilities Bureau were the most intense. The aspects most opposed by the councilors were: (1) The repeated price increases of public utilities, making it impossible for citizens to afford. (2) Fines for conserving electricity and gas, and overcharges for telephone service. Zhou Xiangsheng first asked the Public Utilities Bureau about the large fines for electricity usage, what their purpose was, and whether they could be refunded. If not, it would be best to use them for relief efforts. Chen Weijian said that the transfer and licensing of automobiles should continue. Zhu Wende stated that in Gaoqiao Town, Pudong, residents paid for the installation of electric poles and wires, so why had electricity not been restored yet? Fei Shusheng's criticism of Director Zhao was the most severe. In addition to a written inquiry of approximately 5,000 words, he also made verbal inquiries. The main points were: (1) The "automatic adjustment" of public utility prices affects the cost of living index, placing an excessive burden on citizens. (2) Fines and overcharges for conserving electricity are alarming and should be canceled. Furthermore, are the custodial procedures for the fines clear? A resolution was passed to relax electricity restrictions for schools and hospitals, so why has it not been implemented? (3) Why has a formal public transportation company not been established yet? The highest price for a public bus is 14,000 yuan, which is considerable for civil servants who live far away and must pay daily bus fares. In addition, he raised issues regarding the shady dealings in telephone installations and transfers, the extortion during vehicle licensing, and the forced sale of power-consuming appliances. Lu Huimin asked why electricity charges varied among different companies. Jia Dechao stated, (1) Electricity fines have never been handed over to the treasury, why? (2) *Yejiche* public transportation fares are much lower than public bus fares, indicating that the bus fare increases are unreasonable. Zhou Qize asked whether it would be possible to consider opening up a portion of trishaw licenses, which are being sold on the black market for 20-30 million yuan each. Fan Shouyuan stated that electricity restrictions for hospitals and doctors had not been relaxed, and listed specific instances. Qian Songping said that the Zhenru Electric Power Company has been out of service for several years and its contract should be canceled. Li Shuzi requested streetlights be installed on Zhenru Chaoyang Road. Zhao Yangxiong stated that there is a shortage of electricity in South Shanghai, and what is the status of the agreement between the Chinese-owned Electric Company and the Resources Committee to move back the generators? In addition, Zhang Zhihan, Qu Yue, Zhu Fu Jiu and others also raised questions.</p>
<h3>Billions of Fines in Doubt - Clear Purpose</h3>
<p>Director Zhao Zukang responded to each point: (1) Over 110 billion in fines have already been collected, and it is estimated that 260 billion can be collected by the end of February. Refunds are impossible. The use of the funds will be decided by the Custodial Committee organized by your council, with 70% allocated for installing streetlights and 30% for subsidizing factories that generate their own electricity. If other uses are proposed, they can be passed by the assembly and submitted to the Custodial Committee for distribution. (2) He has requested the Executive Yuan to further relax the automobile transfer policy, but there has been no response. (3) The restoration of electricity to Gaoqiao Town in Pudong has been delegated to the Pudong Electric Company for planning. (4) Regarding Councilor Fei's inquiry, concerning (A) "automatic adjustment," it is actually not automatic, nor was it created here. It is a calculation formula devised by the National Economic Council that combines foreign exchange, oil prices, the cost of living index, and coal prices. The application is very careful, and the company uses this as a basis for calculation, but the municipal government reduces it by 20% to 30% each time, and there are detailed records for each adjustment. (B) The salaries of each company are approved by the Social Affairs Bureau. The salaries of foreign employees are based on contracts. (C) Public school teachers and staff have monthly passes. Public buses are only 300,000 yuan per month. Some schools and hospitals register electricity under private names, so they are unaware. All those who register are granted the relaxation. (D) The original hope was to organize a joint company for public transportation, and discussions are underway with various companies. Furthermore, the current vehicles are not formal vehicles, and foreign exchange must be requested to purchase formal vehicles, which has caused delays. (E) Power consumption devices are required by the Ministry of Economic Affairs to prevent damage to generators.</p>
<h3>Civil Affairs Director Expresses Anxiety About Handling District *Baojia* and Military Service</h3>
<p>Civil Affairs Director Zhang Xiaosong reported: He stated that the biggest difficulty in handling district *baojia* work and military service work is funding. After the rationing system is strengthened, district protection work will become even more burdensome, while funding and personnel are lacking. Regarding rationed items, previously, children under the age of 14 were not issued national identity cards, but now they must all be issued cards to receive small-sized items, which is also a considerable task. Regarding conscription, although 3,000 volunteers were recruited last year, the difficulties with family allowances are indescribable. The government only provided 50,000 yuan per person, but fortunately, the Military Service Association borrowed 12 billion from the Four Banks and Two Bureaus, allowing each family to receive 4 million yuan, but 4.5 billion is still outstanding. This year, the city's conscription quota has increased to 6,000, but all expenses must be raised by the local government. This amount, estimated at 100 billion, raises the question of how to raise it and where to obtain it, which is another cause for anxiety.</p>
<h3>Hope for Reporting Black Market Telephones</h3>
<p>(F) Regarding the black market for telephones, the company has caught several employees extorting money and they have all been fired. It is hoped that reports will be made so that they can be severely punished. Employees who demand money for vehicle licensing have also been fired and over ten people have been sent to court. (5) Preferential monthly pass arrangements for journalists are being drafted. (6) Overcharges for telephone service are being reduced each time. (7) The reason why the fees for each company are not uniform is because the equipment costs of each company are different. (8) All fines are handed over to the city treasury and are auditable. Fees from the previous month are submitted on the 15th of each month. *Yejiche* transport vehicles are simple and charge lower fees because they are a quick profit venture, so they should be cracked down on. The Director also stated that he had already resigned from the Mayor's office, hoping that a more capable person would take over, so that others would have the opportunity to try. (9) If trishaw licenses are opened again, it will be even more difficult to maintain traffic in the central district. (10) Zhenru Electric Company has three months to resume operations, otherwise the Zhabei Electric Power Company will take over. (11) The South Shanghai Chinese-owned Electric Company has a 4,000-kilowatt machine from the Executive Yuan that will be transported there, and the Resources Committee cannot return it. Regarding other issues that require detailed answers, due to time constraints, the speaker requested that Director Zhao provide written answers.</p>
<h3>Mayor and Director Report: Citywide Rice Rationing to Begin on March 1st - Price Not to Exceed 2.25 Million per *Shi*</h3>
<p>[Our Own Report] Mayor Wu and Social Affairs Director Wu Kaixian reported two pieces of news to reporters during a break in yesterday afternoon's City Council meeting: (1) The police, in conjunction with the Gold Control Bureau, uncovered secret telegram communications and 41 organizations operating a black market for gold and banknotes, and arrested a large number of people. As of yesterday afternoon, there was no longer a black market for gold and banknotes. (2) Regarding the issue of citywide rice rationing, it was decided that rationing would begin on March 1st. Ration cards will be issued to district offices today, and rice will be issued tomorrow. Citizens can collect rice from March 1st to 4th. The rationing price will not exceed 2.25 million yuan per *shi*, which is approximately 95% of the average price for the last five days of February. The price of rice will not change within the one-month period from March 1st to March 31st. The rationed rice is American *xian* rice. Furthermore, the Social Affairs Bureau will continue to release rice until the end of the month, releasing 13,000 *dan* per day. The price is also 2.25 million yuan per *shi*.</p>

<h3>Wife of the Speaker Does Not Dare Take Credit - Did Not Donate Towels to the No. 3 Bi Han Asylum</h3>
<p>[Our Own Report] This reporter met with Mrs. Tang Guanyu, wife of Speaker Shen, yesterday. According to her, the statement in yesterday's newspaper by children at the No. 3 Bi Han Asylum that the towels were donated by her may be a misreport. Although she donated steamed buns once after visiting the asylum before the Spring Festival, and also donated vegetables once to refugees at the Jiangwan Gongzhen Asylum, she did not donate towels and does not dare to take credit.</p>
<p>Chairman Jiang Zhaohu of the District People's Congress Delivers an Enthusiastic Speech (Photo by This Newspaper)</p>
<h3>Speeches by District Chiefs and District People's Representatives Arouse Applause from the Assembly</h3>
<p>Before adjourning yesterday's City Council meeting, Mr. Qiu Xisheng, Deputy District Chief of the North Sichuan Road District, and Jiang Zhaohu of Huangpu District, representatives of the 30 district chiefs and representatives of the District People's Congress of this city, were invited to present reports. The sincerity of their words aroused unanimous applause from the assembly. First, Ms. Qiu reported that the work of the district office is not limited to household registration surveys, but includes many important tasks such as sanitation, epidemic prevention and disinfection, security and fire protection, education, social relief, and distribution of goods, all of which are assisted by district protection. However, the outside world does not understand district protection. The most difficult aspect of the work is the lack of funds and personnel. The district office's budget for January was 5 million, while water and electricity expenses alone were over 8 million. Each *bao* only has one *bao* staff member, who is responsible for everything from household surveys to delivering letters from far and near. The *baozhang* has another job, so people often go to the *bao* office and are dissatisfied because no one is there to handle things. District protection offices in urban areas are often conveniently located in commercial establishments, but in suburban areas, they rely entirely on one staff member. Therefore, she made several minimum requirements on behalf of all districts: (1) Increase operating funds. (2) Please add at least one *baoding* (security guard) per *bao* in the municipal budget. (3) Please find a way to resolve the issue of district office buildings. (4) *Baotianzhang* (field leaders) are very difficult to hire, please provide them with protection. Next, Jiang Zhaohu delivered a speech, stating that councilors are produced from the district people, just like a daughter getting married, and must bring the opinions of her mother's family to her husband's family. Millions of citizens have high expectations for you, and hope that you will not disappoint the masses. Reviewing the past four meetings, how many cases have the city government actually implemented? If only one-tenth has been implemented, then the City Council has become a mere ornament. He heard that your council is discussing emergency measures to suppress current prices and hopes for success. Public utility price increases and rent based on the index standard are all increasing the burden on citizens and cannot be arbitrarily passed. He asked the City Council to make simple, clear, and effective proposals, and all the district people in the city will support you. The speaker expressed his gratitude to the two of them.</p>
<h3>Ping-Hu Air Smuggling Drug Case: Li Jianfei and Mai Changde Each Sentenced to Death - Mai Renfa to Life Imprisonment - Five Other Defendants Sentenced to Imprisonment</h3>
<p>[Our Own Report] In the major Ping-Hu air smuggling drug case involving the seizure of over 90 catties of morphine, Judge Shen Tianbao of the District Court delivered the verdict yesterday afternoon: Li Jianfei, who impersonated a colonel, and Mai Changde (also known as Hai Yuyun), the drug kingpin, were found guilty of jointly transporting and selling drugs and sentenced to death.

The remaining 15 defendants, including Kong Fanzhen and Mai Jinbao, were acquitted. Li appeared calm during the sentencing, having already removed his military uniform and wearing an overcoat. Mai Changde and Mai Renfa's expressions changed drastically after hearing the sentence, and family members in the audience burst into tears. All defendants who were sentenced were remanded to custody, and the acquitted defendants were released on their original bail.</p>
<h3>Director of Public Works Bureau Continues to Answer Questions</h3>
<p>Director of the Public Works Bureau Zhao Zukang continued to answer questions from the third meeting: (1) The Pudong Avenue will be completed by the end of April. The construction of the Pudong Avenue bridge is quite expensive and difficult to manage. Therefore, it is hoped that a portion of the increase in automotive municipal construction taxes will be used for bridge construction. (2) The cost of the Zhongshan West Road project is extremely high. At the same time, there were indeed perfunctory repairs due to insufficient coal supply. If any are found, please report them immediately, and the responsible engineer will be disciplined. (3) The construction cost of Guihua Road is 1.8 billion, which has not been done due to limited funds. Now that local people are willing to bear the costs and cooperate, it will be accepted. (4) The estimated construction cost of the north-south main road in the Longhua District is 26 billion. Repairing the northern section alone will require 10 billion. (5) For the requisition of private land in Pudong for road construction, funds have been allocated to the company responsible for paying back the land price. It will be supervised and managed again. (6) Bottle-neck style houses must be demolished once the road system plan is completed.</p>
<h3>Police Quality Improved, Crime Solving Efficiency Increased</h3>
<p>Police Chief Yu Shuping reported on his work, the main points of which were that, in terms of public security, due to the improved quality of the police force, the knowledge and skills of criminal police officers, and household registration surveys, the efficiency of crime solving has increased. At the same time, the number of criminal cases has decreased sharply. From September last year to January this year, there were 90 cases of black market gold and banknotes, 13 cases of private foreign exchange schemes, 17 cases of underground banks, and 6 cases of private radio stations. Regarding cases of hoarding and speculation, there were 5 cases of food hoarding, 5 cases of coal hoarding, 4 cases of oil hoarding, 8 cases of cotton cloth hoarding, 11 cases of wool hoarding, 22 cases of paper hoarding, and 8 other cases. In addition, various tasks such as transportation, opium prohibition, public morals, city appearance, foreign affairs, fire protection, and organization have been improved compared to the past.</p>

The discussion was long, and because several issues still need to be further studied, there were no results yesterday. Another meeting will be held this morning.</p>

<h3>Construction Industry Hopes for Government Assistance to Jointly Solve the Housing Shortage Problem</h3>
<p>[Our Own Report] The National Federation of Construction Industry Associations hosted a reception for the local press at the Merchants Steam Navigation Company Building yesterday at 6:00 PM. Tao Guilin, Chairman of the Association, and Directors Zhang Jiguang and Wang Ziyang, delivered speeches stating that the housing shortage problem is becoming increasingly serious, and the facts are: (1) The construction rate is lower than the depreciation rate. (2) With rising prices, the lump-sum contract system in the construction industry is particularly disadvantageous. (3) The government provides assistance to general industries, but the construction industry has not received any loans. In order to solve the current housing shortage problem, the construction industry is willing to do its best (such as the recently purchased houses in Shanghai, which were designed and built by the construction industry on a voluntary basis). However, it also hopes that the government authorities will provide assistance to reduce the threat of housing shortages.</p>
<h3>Jin Houcheng Advocates Frugality: No Celebrations for Those Under Sixty</h3>
<p>Jin Houcheng of Baoshan, in view of the fact that birthday celebrations originate from inferior customs, and as customs have gradually spread, they not only waste large sums of money but also waste labor. At a time when people's livelihoods are declining and wounds have not yet healed, there should be regulations in line with the government's advocacy of frugality. Therefore, he initiated a rule that only those over sixty years old are allowed to hold birthday celebrations, and imitating the Westerners' chain of happiness, he sent letters to various relatives and friends to support the cause. The main points of the original letter are as follows: (abridged) Now it is proposed that only those over sixty years of age who have completed the *huajia* can hold birthday celebrations. All others should be simple, without gathering friends, without serving wine and food, without giving gifts, and without writing articles. Except for family banquets for close relatives and blood relatives that cannot be avoided due to human feelings, all should be stopped, with the hope that among relatives and friends, they will agree and abide by this principle, so that there will be no risk of error and the atmosphere of advocacy will be revived. Emotion and reason are both integrated, and there is no better way. Imitating the Westerners' chain of happiness and with the approval of my wife, I am sending this letter to you, and I hope that you will grant your favor and also obtain the consent of your wife, and within three days, copy this letter three times and send it to three friends, and send another letter to the sender to support the cause and promote it in advance. I am extremely fortunate."</p>

<h3>Civilization, Friendship, Morality</h3>
<p>— Second Letter Special Correspondent Mao Shuqing</p>
<p>[This newspaper's Brussels Capital City 16th Dispatch] The Belgian Congo colony in Africa is the cornerstone of Belgium's prosperity today. The decline of European hegemony after World War II led the British Empire to relax its grip on India and Burma, France to be unable to restrain Vietnam, and the Dutch kingdom to be troubled by the war in Indonesia, but Belgium alone was free from these troubles. During World War II, the Belgian king was captured by the Nazis, but the Belgian government in exile in London still controlled the Congo colony, using Congolese manpower and resources as capital for national restoration. In particular, the mining of uranium in the Congo became the main raw material for the later American manufacturing of atomic bombs. When I was in the United States last year, a Belgian friend told me that the Belgian government used the raw materials of uranium ore to repay the American "Lend-Lease Act," and the international friendship and commercial exchanges between the United States and Belgium after the war were much better than the relationship between the United States and Finland after the first war. (Note: Finland is the only country that fully repaid the American "war debt").</p>
<p>Congo Uranium Mine</p>
<p>Brussels is full of American goods and American movies. In addition, the young Belgian men and women speak American English, which reminds people of the prosperity of New York and the factors that created this prosperity. I asked Mr. Was of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' Press Office if he could tell me something about the initial mining of uranium ore in the Congo. He gave me more than a dozen books about the Congo colony, including the history of the Congo's development, the achievements of King Leopold II's management, the races of Congolese blacks, and their struggle against modern material civilization, and even the recent achievements of Belgian rule: five thousand schools, one million students, four thousand modern hospitals, clinics, and sanatoriums, three thousand two hundred miles of railways, and fifty thousand miles of highways. Mr. Fritchawer, Minister of the Colonial Department of the Belgian government, said: "Belgians govern colonies not only for unilateral interests... Helping the people of the colonies to enjoy the happiness of modern material civilization is the main principle of Belgian colonial policy."</p>
<p>However, in these books, there is no introduction to uranium mining. Mr. Was of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs said that uranium ore does exist, but the Belgian government is unwilling to announce it. "Because this is still a secret." He said: There are many foreign reporters in Brussels who often want to know about this issue, but there has been no response.</p>
<p>Economic Cooperation</p>
<p>There are many foreign reporters living in Brussels, but routine press conferences are rare. There are only two or three times a year, and press conferences are only held for more important events. The current Prime Minister Spaak, the former President of the United Nations General Assembly, is quite happy to meet reporters. During my stay in Brussels, he went to Luxembourg. Mr. Sevane, Spaak's confidential secretary, is the current head of the Press Office of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Acting Charge d'Affaires Qu Chunbo introduced me to visit him twice at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs on Laroie Street. He was with Prime Minister Spaak in Luxembourg.</p>
<p>Luxembourg is currently holding the Benelux economic cooperation plan. There is a new term popular in Europe now called "Benelux," which is a quick sketch of the country names of Belgium, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg. In the correspondence from the Netherlands, I mentioned Spaak's speech on the economic cooperation of the three countries. According to outsiders' estimates, if the economic units of the three countries form a whole, their total import and export trade can become the third largest in the world. In addition to the United States and the United Kingdom, it should be Benelux. At present, Belgian and Dutch newspapers are extremely excited about Benelux, and the editors of the newspapers attach even more importance to the economic cooperation between Belgium, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg than the Marshall Plan for European aid.</p>
<p>Foreign Minister Puxi</p>
<p>Because of the urgency of time, I did not go to Luxembourg to visit. In 1945, I met the Foreign Minister of Luxembourg, Puxi, in Paris, an easy-going old man who made a lifelong career as a foreign minister, liked to tell jokes, and was never pessimistic or worried. I remember that he raised his thumb at that time, imitating China, and then extended the tip of his little finger: "That is our Luxembourg." He was also happy to talk about his friendship with Ambassador Gu Shaochuan, and the arrogance of Yosuke Matsuoka during the September 18th Incident, etc. That year, I visited Luxembourg. After more than two years of separation, I heard that Luxembourg's steel industry had recovered to the pre-war level. Like Belgium, they are both countries that export steel. The currency used in Luxembourg is the currency popular in Belgium. Embassies and legations of various countries in Belgium are also concurrently stationed in Luxembourg. It is said that China is the only exception.</p>
<p>Sino-Belgian Marriage</p>
<p>Belgium and Luxembourg are both very friendly to China. Among the 300,000 people in Luxembourg, there was once an unprecedented woman who married a Chinese husband. This was probably more than ten years ago. Foreign Minister Puxi told me in Paris in 1945. More Belgian women are married to Chinese. Mr. Lu Zhengxiang's deceased wife was Belgian. People at the embassy said that Mr. Lu Zhengxiang is doing well and is still doing his religious work. Because of the urgency of time, I did not go to the monastery to visit Mr. Lu.</p>
<p>Friends of China</p>
<p>Father Ding Guming, a Catholic messenger, followed Father Lebbe during the war to save the wounded in the war zone of North China as "Friends of China." Recently, he gave a quite wonderful public speech in Brussels, talking about the long-standing cultural foundation of China, the Chinese family system, and the stories of Chinese loyalty, filial piety, and righteousness, which won much praise from Belgian society. Several hundred people attended the lecture that day, including the current Minister of Commerce, the Undersecretary of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and the former Ambassador Ji Youmu. Father Ding Guming's Belgian name was originally called "Maidan." The three characters "Ding Guming" were taken after he came to China. Acting Charge d'Affaires Qu Chunbo concluded his speech by saying that Father Ding "knows China, understands China, and loves China." The audience applauded wildly.</p>
<p>No matter how difficult our national fortune is, with our moral tradition, we can find true friends who love China in any corner of the world. We must not lose our self-confidence. We have reason to be self-confident! (At the Gangtai Bi Hotel)</p>
<h3>Emergency Relief Society to Relieve the Subei Flood Area, Assist Spring Farming, and Eradicate Kala-Azar</h3>
<p>[This newspaper Zhenjiang 25th Dispatch] In Subei, the Huai, Xu, and Hai prefectures and seventeen counties and cities suffered a major flood last autumn, with a vast disaster area and more than five million victims. The water receded in early winter, but because of the insecurity in some areas, the embankment restoration project in many places was difficult to start for a while, and the relief of the disaster area was also urgent. Therefore, in the autumn, the provincial government hired leaders from all walks of life to establish the Jiangsu Provincial Flood Emergency Relief Society to engage in fundraising work. On the one hand, it first selected areas where security was established to carry out work relief to restore the embankment, and on the other hand, it implemented emergency relief to provide emergency assistance to the victims. Now that the spring season has arrived, there are two major difficulties in the Huaibei disaster area that urgently need relief. One is to assist spring farming and relieve the spring famine, and the other is to treat the local epidemic of Kala-azar. This is the current urgent plan for post-disaster recovery. Since its establishment, the Jiangsu Provincial Flood Emergency Relief Society has raised a total of 13.662598445 billion yuan (including bank interest) in Shanghai, Nanjing, and Zhenjiang. The society held its fifth regular meeting in Zhenjiang on the afternoon of the 19th. Decisions were made at the meeting regarding the above two urgent relief items. The resolutions are recorded as follows: (1) Organize a mobile inspection team immediately to inspect the relief situation. (2) Allocate 1 billion yuan for special relief to Xu prefecture. (3) Allocate 300 million yuan for Hai prefecture to relieve the spring famine. (4) Extend the work relief committee to the end of June this year. (5) Transfer 8,000 bags of flour and 10,000 pieces of fine cloth purchased and stored to the work relief committee for management, specifically for work relief projects. (6) After the Shanghai wheel industry donation arrives, first allocate 400 million yuan from the Subei Refugee Relief Association's special Kala-azar relief fund. (7) The spring famine in Xuhai is serious, and the people are unable to make a living. The association will send telegrams to the National Government, the Executive Yuan, and the Ministry of Social Affairs, requesting that a large amount of funds be allocated from the US aid to China food procurement price and special relief donations to provide special emergency relief. (8) Adopt the principle of matching food when distributing work relief wages, and exchange the 8,000 bags of first-class flour purchased and stored for regular flour, and the 10,000 pieces of fine cloth for bean cakes, and transport them to the work sections for use. (9) Telegraph the counties in the disaster area to quickly guide the organization of agricultural loan institutions to actively promote agricultural loans. (10) Telegraph the China Farmers Bank and the Central Cooperative Treasury to discuss simplifying loan procedures for agricultural loans in the disaster area. (11) Transfer 6 billion yuan to relieve the spring famine in the flood area, and hand it over to the Social Affairs Office for planning and implementation.</p>
<h3>Two Thousand Female Workers in Changzhou Knock on the [Door of Survival]</h3>
<p>[This newspaper Wujin 25th Dispatch] The Dacheng Yarn Factory No. 1 Factory, fine yarn room, outside the South Gate of this county, recently planned to recruit 16 trainee female workers. An examination was held at 8:00 am on the 22nd. Before the examination, no less than hundreds of letters of introduction from various relevant parties were received. Temporarily, more than 2,000 girls aged 18 or 19 from all over the city and countryside rushed to take the exam. For a time, the square in front of the factory and the vicinity of Dean Bridge formed a sea of people, with a crowded mass of heads. The factory officials deeply felt that they could not cope with the situation. The prepared admission tickets, only two or three hundred, could not be distributed either. They had no choice but to go back and forth in the crowd to find those with relatively beautiful faces and dignified attitudes to issue admission tickets first. For a time, the voices were noisy, and the admission tickets were scrambled for, and the order was greatly disrupted. They had to quickly order the factory doors to be closed tightly and send police to maintain order. A small number of people who received admission tickets were put in batches to take the exam. The women outside the door were chattering all day and did not disperse until late at night, when they left unhappy. The factory continued the re-examination on the 23rd. It is a pity that the quota was only 16 people. This matter has aroused sighs of sympathy from the society, and everyone shouted "Life is difficult!" more than once.</p>

Police officer Zhao Zhangquan was shot twice by the bandits and died. Two bandits were also wounded by the police. Afterwards, they fled towards Xinlu Ao. County Chief Zhou immediately urged the police team to pursue in three directions. At about 5:00 pm, they encountered them under Taibai Mountain, causing a fierce battle. In this battle, one wounded bandit was captured and five rifles were recovered. The remaining bandits fled in all directions and are still being pursued.</p>

<h3>Central Trust Bureau Announces Procedures for Acquisition and Distribution of Imported Goods Arriving Without Licenses and with Self-Provided Foreign Exchange</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The Central Trust Bureau yesterday announced the complete procedures for applying for the acquisition and distribution of imported goods arriving without licenses and with self-provided foreign exchange, as follows:</p>
<p>Application Procedures</p>
<p>(1) If an importer wishes to sell the arrived goods to the government, they should immediately submit the bill of lading and other relevant documents, along with the import license application, to the Export-Import Control Committee in accordance with the prescribed procedures, applying for government acquisition. (2) After receiving the above application, the Export-Import Control Committee, after review, will issue an import license and directly send the license and bill of lading to the Purchasing Department of the Central Trust Bureau. The Acquisition Group, Distribution Group, Finance Group, and Transportation Group of the Purchasing Department will then handle the matter in sequence.</p>
<p>Acquisition Procedures</p>
<p>(1) Upon receiving the import license and its attachments transferred by the Export-Import Control Committee, the Purchasing Department of the Central Trust Bureau will immediately issue an acquisition notice letter directly to the original applicant (the importer). At the same time, two blank "Application for Acquisition by the Purchasing Department of the Central Trust Bureau" forms will be enclosed for use. (2) After receiving the acquisition notice from the Central Trust Bureau, the importer should promptly fill out the application for acquisition, along with all required documents, within two weeks, and personally deliver them to the Acquisition Group of the Purchasing Department of the Central Trust Bureau (Room 320, 3rd Floor). At the same time, the importer should obtain an application form for priority distribution and a "List of Contracts with Direct Users" from the Central Trust Bureau for completion. (3) Upon receiving the application for acquisition and all required attachments, the Acquisition Group of the Central Trust Bureau will immediately register the application and issue an "Acquisition Certificate" to the original importer for safekeeping. The Acquisition Certificate serves as a receipt for the acquired goods. In the future, it will be used to exchange for the approved special foreign currency deposit certificate. The acquisition procedure is thus completed.</p>
<p>Distribution Procedures</p>
<p>(1) After completing the acquisition procedures, the importer should promptly fill out the "Priority Purchase Application" within three weeks from the date of receiving the Acquisition Certificate, along with the direct user's order and ten copies of the list of contracts with direct users. The contract list should be stamped with the seal of certification from the trade association or a reputable firm in the same industry and submitted to the Distribution Group of the Purchasing Department of the Central Trust Bureau (Room 314, 3rd Floor) to apply for priority purchase. (2) After receiving the distribution application, the Central Trust Bureau will review it and, if it meets the requirements, approve the distribution and notify the original importer to complete the distribution procedures. The original importer will then, based on the notification, go to the Central Trust Bureau to sign a contract and find two reputable shop guarantors to sign and guarantee the contract.</p>
<p>Payment Procedures</p>
<p>To be handled at the Finance Group of the Purchasing Department of the Central Trust Bureau (Room 314, 3rd Floor). (1) The payment for the purchased goods can be made in three installments. (A) 25% to be paid in cash on the date of signing the priority distribution contract. (B) 25% as a 30-day commercial acceptance draft. (C) 50% as a 45-day commercial acceptance draft. When paying the 25% cash, the entire amount can be settled according to the foreign exchange listing rate of the day.</p>
<p>Procedures for Obtaining the Bill of Lading</p>
<p>To be handled at the Storage and Transportation Group of the Purchasing Department of the Central Trust Bureau (Storage and Transportation Office on the First Floor). (1) After completing the payment procedures, the Central Trust Bureau will issue a letter of guarantee for borrowing the bill of lading and lend the original bill of lading (if the acceptance draft is accepted by a bank, the bill of lading can be taken all at once). Together with the signed import license, the original importer will then go to the shipping company to issue a split bill of lading and complete customs declaration and tax payment procedures. (In the bill of lading borrowing procedure, the Central Trust Bureau stipulates that two shop guarantors must return the bill of lading within three weeks). (2) The bill of lading will be split into three copies (two copies and one copy). One-quarter copy is for the original importer to take delivery of the goods. The other two copies are to be returned to the Central Trust Bureau for safekeeping. At the same time, the previously issued "Letter of Guarantee for Borrowing the Bill of Lading" will be withdrawn. (3) When the two commercial acceptance drafts for 30 days and 45 days mature, the corresponding split bills of lading kept by the Central Trust Bureau will be taken out to take delivery of the goods, and the special foreign currency deposit certificate for the acquired goods will be collected. At this point, all application, acquisition, distribution, and purchase procedures are completed.</p>
<h3>Rice Prices in Production Areas Reported to Rise; Rice Market Transactions Halted; Social Affairs Bureau Sells 13,000 piculs</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The rising trend in the rice market continues unabated. Yesterday, the total registered arrivals in the North and South markets were only 2,449 piculs. Because of the high price quotations from Wuxi production areas, many clients were unwilling to sell on the market and instead kept their rice on the grain boats in the Suzhou Creek, adopting a wait-and-see attitude. The market situation is chaotic, with numerous rumors, making people feel uneasy and causing transactions to halt. The off-market price reached 3 million, but there were no transactions. The Social Affairs Bureau continued to sell 13,000 piculs at a price of 2.25 million, distributing them to 2,100 rice shops, with a door price of 2.45 million. However, each person was limited to purchasing five liters, and many citizens lined up to buy. According to the person in charge of the Social Affairs Bureau: Currently, the rice prices in production areas such as Wuxi often exceed those in this city, which is an abnormal phenomenon. If the rice price in this city is too low, rice merchants, prioritizing profit, will cause a backflow, affecting the city's reserves, and the consequences will be more serious than the current situation. After careful review, the authorities believe that maintaining a balance between rice prices in various regions is the most important thing. Currently, in addition to suppressing prices in production areas, the city will also implement comprehensive grain rationing starting from March, which can also alleviate the rising trend to a considerable extent.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the price of white japonica rice broke through the 3 million mark, once shouted up to 3.1 million, but later there were a few transactions at 3.05 million. Thin paddy rice also reached the 3 million mark, and early rice was 2.95 million, each rising sharply by 400,000 to 500,000 yuan compared to the previous day. Market transactions were limited to supplying rationed rice, with no other transactions.</p>
<p>Flour: Due to the sharp rise in rice prices, wheat opened high at 1.9 million. The soaring prices in Suzhou and Wuxi made buying even more active, and sellers were even less willing to sell, causing prices to rise again sharply. Lao Che brand flour opened at 1.45 million, then fell back to 1.44 million. Hong Feng and Jian Cheng brands both opened at 1.4 million, then soared all the way to 1.43 million. At the close, Hong Feng was at 1.4 million and Jian Cheng was at 1.39 million, each brand rising sharply by 120,000 to 130,000 yuan compared to the previous day. Large-bag bran was actively traded, opening at 850,000, rising all the way to 920,000, and closing at 900,000, a sharp increase of 100,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Cooking Oil: Seeing an unprecedented and large-scale price surge, the tension in the market has reached a point where sellers have disappeared. At a time when the second phase of household oil rationing has already begun, this price surge is completely unexpected. Yesterday, sellers held firm until the close, and there were no transactions. After the close, there were a few transactions. Factory soybean oil opened at 6.8 million, and rapeseed oil at 6.7 million, each rising sharply by 900,000 yuan. Raw oil surged by a huge 1 million yuan. Qingdao Ji brand raw oil traded at 7.5 million, with extremely few transactions. Soybean cake initially rose sharply by 10%, and at the close, it softened back, a sharp increase of 400,000 to 500,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Miscellaneous Grains: Soybean commission houses and oil factories both entered the market, and the rising trend was fierce. Zha bean opened in the morning at 1.7 million yuan, already up 200,000 yuan from yesterday's market, and there were still many buyers, rising to 1.75 million yuan, a total increase of 250,000 yuan. Hankou car bean was at 1.9 million yuan, and Xianbu soybean was at 900,000 yuan, an increase of 200,000 to 250,000 yuan. The northern commission house had stocks of red sorghum. Zhabu red sorghum once reached a high of 1.92 million, an increase of more than 300,000 yuan. Later, due to a slowdown in sales, it fell back to 1.88 million yuan. Although the Tianjin commission house did not move its sesame seeds, because other grains were all rising, it dared not lag behind. Jiujiang milk sudan once rose to 3.2 million yuan, then fell back to 3.15 million yuan, with few transactions. Shelled peanuts were forcefully acquired by the Guangdong commission house, and tracked upwards. Qinhuangdao shelled peanuts opened at 4.3 million yuan, an increase of more than 300,000 yuan. Picked green beans also rose to 1.13 million yuan. Only corn was the odd one out, with high-grade goods flat and mediocre, and medium-grade goods selling relatively actively, with prices similar to yesterday's market.</p>
<h3>Rumors of Pound Sterling Devaluation; Hong Kong Dollar Market Price Plummets</h3>
<p>[United Press Hong Kong, 26th] Since the war, the Hong Kong dollar has been consistently stable at US$0.2525. On the 25th, due to rumors of a pound sterling devaluation, the open market price fell to US$0.16. According to a British government spokesperson, this rumor, like past ones, is untrue and is a common tactic of speculators. At the same time, large sums of money being remitted to the United States have increased market unrest. The price of gold also surged to HK$372 per ounce, and closed at HK$365.</p>
<h3>Floating Capital Swarms In; Chinese Stocks' Rising Trend Difficult to Curb</h3>
<p>Although Chinese stocks encountered external resistance as many as six times yesterday, rising and then falling, the assistance of materials and the impetus of the environment led to a wildfire-like effect near the close. Guohuo, with its new initiatives, and Jinglun, Jingfu, Meiya, and Qinxing all reached their daily limit again.</p>
<p>At the morning opening, Yongsheng Yarn fell to 1,020 yuan and 1,060 yuan, but small stocks continued to shine. Jinglun Net continued to hit its daily limit, and Guohuo also quickly caught up, opening much higher, attracting stock buyers, and suddenly the demand exceeded the supply, immediately hitting the limit. Yongsheng Yarn also gradually rose to a high price of 1,060 yuan and 1,095 yuan. The off-market interest rate still opened at 2.1 and 2.55 cents. Coupled with the tightening of off-market crackdowns, it gradually fell to a low price of 1,005 yuan and 1,040 yuan. Near noon, a buying spree was stirred up again. With Meiya being absorbed at numbers 207 and 224, it also rose a lot. Number 176 absorbed Rongfeng, and the buying spree was also extremely popular. Yongsheng Yarn closed at 1,060 yuan and 1,090 yuan. Compared with the previous day's closing price, Guohuo and Jinglun immediately hit the limit, Xinguang and Lian'an rose by 10%, Jingfu, Meiya, Qinxing, Xinhua, and Zhongsi rose by 5%, and the rest rose slightly. For deferred delivery stocks, Huafeng fell slightly, Xinguang, Jingfu, and Meiya rose by 5%, Qinxing rose by 10%, and the rest rose slightly.</p>
<p>In the afternoon market, the price immediately rose to 1,075 yuan and 1,100 yuan, and was even pushed to 1,083 yuan and 1,110 yuan. Off-market telephone investigations became even tighter, and traffic brigades also entered the market. National Bank intervened, and the price fell to a low of 1,040 yuan and 1,070 yuan. When a counter-movement occurred, off-market matched trades were restricted again, and short sellers were panicked, while long buyers raised prices vigorously, and near the close, it rose to a new peak of 1,145 yuan and 1,152 yuan. Number 176 forcefully bought Meiya for immediate delivery, number 236 bought Meiya for deferred delivery, number 175 bought Qinxing for deferred delivery, and number 204 bought Jingfu for immediate delivery, also forcing them to rise to the limit. Lian'an and Xinhua also reached their limits near the close. As a result, compared with the morning's closing price for immediate delivery stocks, Guohuo, Jinglun, Jingfu, Meiya, Lian'an, and Xinhua all hit the limit, Neiyi was flat, Xinguang rose slightly, Zhabei, Zhongfa, Huochai, Shangwu, Tongyi, and Zhongfang each rose by about 10%, and the rest rose by 5%. For deferred delivery stocks, Qinxing and Meiya hit the limit, and the rest rose by 5%. Among off-market unlisted stocks, bank stocks were the most popular, rising by 10%. Utility stocks were mediocre, and the rest rose slightly by 5% or less.</p>
<p>Arbitrage Trading</p>
<p>Yesterday, the phenomenon of loose credit continued. The interest rate for bill discounting was only 1.3 to 1.8 cents, and after a high point, it gradually decreased. In terms of discount prices, Yongsheng Yarn initially opened at 42 yuan, a high price of 43 yuan, a low price of 34 yuan, and closed at 38 yuan. Meiya retreated from 75 yuan to 65 yuan, and Xinhe retreated from 18 yuan to 17 yuan at the close. Huafeng was 23 yuan, and Xinguang was 6.5 yuan.</p>
<p>Range of Increase and Decrease</p>
<p>The Securities Exchange announced yesterday that the range of stock price increases and decreases would be changed to 1 cent for those below 200 yuan, 5 cents for those between 200 yuan and 1,000 yuan, 1 yuan for those between 1,000 yuan and 5,000 yuan, and 5 yuan for those at or above 5,000 yuan, which has been implemented starting from yesterday afternoon.</p>
<h3>National Bonds Led the Rise; Foreign Stocks Were Briskly Profitable</h3>
<p>Government bonds also led the rise yesterday, but it was difficult to sustain. Category C bonds opened in the morning at 90,000 yuan, reached a high price of 100,000 yuan, and then gradually fell back. Rooms 550 and 552 of Dachengxing bought in, while rooms 503, 360, and 500 sold out. The turnover was about 4 million. Compared with the previous close, categories A, B, and D were flat, category C rose by 1,000 yuan, and category E was up by 4,001 yuan.</p>
<p>Foreign stocks stabilized with Hong Kong Electric halfway through the day, and fell back after rising. However, the process still followed the Chinese stock route, and brisk profitability was reported again near the close. Guangdong commission houses and foreign firms had mixed buying and selling, and securities commission houses sold first and then bought in. Yisha opened in the morning at 1.17 million, fell back to 1.11 million, and then turned around. Finally, the market surged again, approaching a high price of 1.3 million at the close. Compared with the previous close, Yisha, British Union, and Aviation each rose by 5%, and the rest rose slightly.</p>
<h3>Yarn and Cloth Soared All the Way; Fine Yarn and Fangjian Not Listed</h3>
<p>Regarding the cotton yarn market yesterday, at the morning opening, due to the excessive increase the day before, all parties adopted a wait-and-see attitude, and the market tended to be stable. The Yuanfang and Jian company continued to be listed, with only grades below 21 counts, and 42 and 32 counts had no listed prices, so people's hearts were firm. 42-count Jianfeng fine yarn went straight up to 130 million yuan, and 40-count yarns each broke through the 100 million yuan mark.</p>
<p>Regarding the cotton cloth market yesterday, at the initial opening, the bidding was all weakened due to some retail investors still selling and the asking price was once suppressed. With the help of the customers and dyeing factories, the market broke out again. As a result, 12-pound leading five-blessing and other grades of fine cloth continued to rise from 70,000 to 156,000 yuan compared to the previous day.</p>
<p>Spot Cotton Turned Stable Yesterday, the trading volume in the spot cotton market turned prosperous, and the industry absorbed as soon as they saw sales, and the market price rose. In the afternoon, the cotton yarn was slightly smaller, and the floating multiples took the opportunity to sell high, and the trend was 　stable. However, due to the depletion of sources, people were still hoarding, and prices did not see a small decline. The total daily turnover was 450 packages.</p>
<p>Fangjian Sold Yarn [Reported by This Newspaper] Yesterday, China Fangjian Company continued to sell yarn on behalf of the Yarn Management Committee at the Yarn Industry Association, with a total of 16 types opened. About 2,400 pieces were allowed to purchase, totaling about 3,000 pieces of 20-count yarn.</p>
<h3>Silk Yarn and Woven Products Rose</h3>
<p>Silk woven products, feather yarn, sleeve lining silk, yarn woven products, western shirts, flower broadcloth, white sailcloth, hemp cloth, rainproof cloth, soft lining, woolen fabrics, wool flannel, flannel, women's color cloth, Huo Mu Four-Book, Hailishi, and Tieni, etc., have all risen sharply since yesterday. China Textile first shouted for an increase, and the factories of Zhanghua, Xiexin, Yuanfeng, and Yinfeng each followed suit, raising the factory prices by 20%. The listing prices in door stores and zero-cut stores were therefore fiercely increased again. The standards for the tea party market and large wholesalers have once again entered a state of chaos.</p>
<h3>Rayon Initially Weak then Firm; Silk Goods Transactions Desolate</h3>
<p>The rayon market was weak yesterday morning. No. 120 Asahi brand Yukiji was priced at 43 million yuan at the opening, and once rose to 49 million yuan for the spot price, and the price for the next day was lowered to 41 million yuan in the afternoon. The market suddenly turned brisk in the afternoon, and the opening was as high as 55 million yuan, and the final selling price was 60 million yuan.</p>
<p>The factory price was slightly firmer yesterday morning. The C-grade was opened at 62 million yuan, and the high-level zero-cut price was also transacted at 58 million yuan. The dry processed silk was traded at 25 million yuan. Continued to rise in the afternoon, and the price of C-grade shouted as high as 70 million yuan, and the high zero-cut price was valued at 65 million yuan, but no transactions were made.</p>
<p>The silk goods market continued to be brisk yesterday, and the transactions of silk quilts and checkered crepe in the venue initially stopped due to disputes over the difference in gold. After the market was reopened at 9:30, Huaqiang quilts were made for 5.5 million yuan, and Dachong checkered Biyu was priced at 285,000 yuan. The transaction was very desolate, and the other goods were also promoted.</p>
<h3>The exchange rate of Taiwan dollars suddenly rose to 1 to 137 yesterday.</h3>
<p>[This paper combined the North and the 26th telegram] The price increase in Shanghai has affected Taiwan, and the exchange rate of Taiwan dollars to French currency suddenly rose to 1 to 137 yuan on the 26th. The province is famous for producing rice, and it has now risen to 80 yuan per catty.</p>
<h3>The yarn pipe will suppress the surge in cotton prices and formulate emergency measures</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] The yarn pipe association believes that commodity prices have been rising day by day, and cotton prices have also increased accordingly. In the past, the material and transportation department of the association convened the parties concerned to make reasonable adjustments based on the actual situation in the market.</p>
<p>It is now reported that some unscrupulous cotton merchants are freely buying and selling cotton privately, raising prices and disrupting the market. If strict investigation and prohibition are not carried out, the cotton unified purchase policy will inevitably be affected. In order to suppress the surge in cotton prices, the association has formulated five "temporary emergency measures to suppress the surge in cotton prices" and strictly implemented them.</p>
<p>The measures are explored and recorded as follows: (1) The Yarn Control Committee and the Municipal Government will jointly announce that the free buying and selling of cotton is prohibited. Those who violate the rules will have their cotton confiscated and will be severely punished according to law. (2) The association will send a letter to the Shanghai Municipal Government and the Garrison Command to strictly prohibit the black market trading of cotton. (3) The association will notify the warehouses again that all cotton stored by manufacturers must have the association's transfer notice before it can be released from the warehouse. If there is any unauthorized transfer, the warehouses will be fully responsible. (4) The association will investigate the amount of cotton stored by manufacturers in each warehouse. (5) The association will write to the Customs and ask them to notify the association of each day's transfers for future reference, and no extraction is allowed without the association's permission.</p>

<p>New Medicine and New Drugs</p>
<h3>Mourning My Teacher Professor Fahr</h3>
<p>— Liang Junqing</p>
<p>Suddenly, a piece of bad news came, saying that the great German pathologist, Professor Fahr, had committed suicide and died. Immediately, a kind of indescribable sadness filled my heart, causing me to look westward and think for a long time.</p>
<p>I remembered when I was studying at the University of Hamburg in Germany, I always listened to his teachings in the pathological anatomy room for several hours every day. Now that I have returned to China for seventeen or eighteen years, I have never forgotten his short body, his gray William-style beard, his round and large half-bald head, and his kind and often smiling shadow. Indeed, anyone who has heard him give a lecture once will not forget his kind attitude and his eloquent and clear speech. But now he is dead. He committed suicide because he was unaccustomed to the tragic situation after Germany's defeat. Alas! This is truly a great loss to the world's medical community.</p>
<p>Our teacher, Professor Fahr (Prof. Dr. Th. Fahr), should be about seventy years old now. He has been working diligently and tirelessly throughout his life, burying himself in research, invention, and tirelessly enlightening future generations. He has made great contributions to research on muscular rheumatism. He has also made very successful discoveries in the field of cancer. In addition, he has also done many admired research works in the fields of heart and nerves. However, unlike other pathologists who specialize in self-aggrandizement and try to boast in various ways, fearing that people would not know about their own achievements, he was very humble and reserved. Although he can be said to be an authority in the field of pathology, he never boasted, he only knew how to dedicate his life's work to medicine and to train future generations. People like him who do not want fame or fortune, and only know how to strive for medicine, are rare not only in China, but also in Germany. So I feel infinitely sad about his death!</p>
<p>I often hear friends say: "Life is like a lifetime, grass grows for an autumn. A person lives in the world, either for fame or for profit. If you are neither for fame nor for profit, then aren't you a fool?" Indeed, these words have their truth. My teacher may have discovered that he was being a fool, neither for fame nor for profit, but only knowing how to seek welfare for the people throughout his life. As a result, after working hard all his life, he could only do some life-saving work to some extent, but in every corner of the world, countless people were making weapons to kill people, or were killing people in large numbers, so he was discouraged, and took a pistol to end his foolish life.</p>
<p>However, I always feel that there are too few fools like him in the world. If there could be many fools, maybe this world would be a little better. It is a pity that a fool like him is also dead.</p>
<p>Alas! He has ended his foolish life very comfortably. I wonder if the work we do here every week is welcomed by him?</p>
<h3>Defense Against Pulmonary Tuberculosis</h3>
<p>— Yu Zhengxing</p>
<p>B Fresh Air. Fresh air is essential for treating tuberculosis, so patients should spend more time outdoors. If the doctor permits, patients can sleep on the veranda. Even when living indoors, windows should be kept open day and night, except during bad weather (such as strong winds), as stale air contains carbon dioxide, moisture, dust, germs, and other impurities. Moreover, it lacks oxygen, making it unsuitable for patients. Therefore, one should live in a place with good air circulation and coolness. It is not advisable to reside in cities; instead, move to the countryside, to a place with a good environment for recuperation. The living room should be bright, spacious, clean, and tidy to avoid dust. Open the windows daily to allow air to circulate, facilitating easy breathing, as tuberculosis bacteria do not easily survive in circulating air.</p>
<p>C Climate. Climate significantly affects tuberculosis. It is advisable to choose a high mountain or coastal climate, as it can stimulate appetite and increase oxygen supply, promoting metabolism and shifting the disease mechanism towards improvement. However, patients with hemoptysis (coughing up blood) should avoid high altitudes. High mountains and coastal areas often experience strong winds and sudden weather changes, so it is best to choose a suitable location that avoids these drawbacks.</p>
<p>(II) Nutritional Diet. Tuberculosis patients experience significant bodily consumption, requiring more replenishment. Patients often have taste disorders and reduced appetite, so they should be provided with highly nutritious and easily digestible foods to compensate for their losses. Weight gain is a sign of recovery from this disease. To achieve this, one should stimulate a strong appetite and choose highly nutritious foods. All essential nutrients should be adequately present, avoiding both deficiency and excess, to ensure a balanced supply for the body's nutritional needs. However, avoid overeating to prevent gastrointestinal issues. Eggs, chicken, and fresh vegetables are excellent foods. Meat and milk are secondary choices, but considering that Chinese people generally lack a habit of consuming milk, this should be taken into account. Additionally, include appropriate carbohydrates and a large amount of vitamin C for regulation. A small amount of alcohol can stimulate appetite and is permissible. Cod liver oil is rich in vitamins A and D, nourishing the body and increasing resistance, so it can be used liberally. However, pay attention to appetite when taking it; discontinue if there are any disturbances. Regarding the quantity of various foods, aim for moderation and avoid forcing oneself.</p>
<p>(III) Rest and Recuperation. The main treatment for pulmonary tuberculosis patients is rest. Therefore, patients should be kept absolutely quiet, resting in bed, and minimizing activity. Generally, pulmonary tuberculosis patients often experience excessive consumption, poor appetite, and insufficient nutrition. Excessive exercise further increases consumption, so sufficient rest is essential to maintain physiological functions. However, consider the sunlight exposure and duration when lying down. The purpose of bed rest for tuberculosis patients is similar to resting to allow wound regeneration. The lungs breathe fifty times per minute when running, twenty-five times when walking, and ten times when resting. Thus, resting can reduce lung movement to ten times per minute, increasing lung rest, regeneration ability, and opportunity. Rest is not just about not working; recuperation involves lying in bed, resting peacefully. Physical rest is not enough; mental rest is also necessary. Worry, anxiety, and excessive concern can cause mental unease. Mental unease prevents the full benefits of rest. Constant fretting about one's illness is a sign of weak willpower. One must maintain a cheerful mind, and the illness will easily heal; as the saying goes, "a broad mind leads to a robust body."</p>
<p>Preventive Measures</p>
<p>(I) Establishing Tuberculosis Consultation Centers. Local health authorities should establish specialized tuberculosis consultation centers as the core of tuberculosis prevention. Their responsibilities include health education on tuberculosis, guidance and supervision of healthy individuals, and prevention or improvement of patients' living environment, nutrition, and occupation, as well as guidance on recuperation and caregiving methods. Patients may also be sent to appropriate sanatoriums for isolation.</p>
<p>(II) Universally Establishing Tuberculosis Clinics. Local governments have a duty to prevent tuberculosis and should establish tuberculosis clinics universally. Their primary tasks include early diagnosis, detection of new cases, examination of contacts, and monitoring patients undergoing home treatment. Night clinics should also be opened to facilitate medical visits for working patients. Other measures such as home visits, nursing, disinfection, testing, education, and isolation of tuberculosis patients should be vigorously promoted.</p>
<p>(III) Sanatoriums. Sanatoriums can be divided into two types: recuperative sanatoriums and treatment sanatoriums. Acute, critical, and difficult cases are generally sent to treatment sanatoriums. Patients with better prognoses who require long-term recuperation are sent to recuperative sanatoriums. In addition, the establishment of "tuberculosis villages" to accommodate discharged patients and provide employment guidance, as well as solutions to nutrition and housing problems, is also very important.</p>
<p>(IV) Mandating Practitioner Participation in Prevention Efforts. Physicians have a duty to educate pulmonary tuberculosis patients on preventive measures and to report to health authorities. Practitioners must cooperate with health authorities, working together to combat tuberculosis and becoming part of the prevention effort.</p>
<p>(V) Defining Sanitary Administrative Authority. Sanitary administrative authorities have the power to issue orders and punishments when they believe there is a risk of spreading pulmonary tuberculosis. They also have the authority to order improvements to facilities in factories and schools. Tuberculosis patients and their families have a duty to comply with the tasks carried out by sanitary authorities.</p>
<p>Preventive Vaccination: To prevent pulmonary tuberculosis, BCG vaccine can be used to generate special immunity in the body, resisting tuberculosis bacteria. The BCG vaccine was invented in 1921, originally named Bacilles de Calmette et Guerin, after its inventors, the French scientists Calmette and Guerin. BCG is a type of tuberculosis bacteria from cattle. After rigorous processing, it can be injected into the human body without harm, while generating resistance to tuberculosis bacteria. The BCG vaccine can enhance the resistance to tuberculosis bacteria in infants and reduce the infant tuberculosis mortality rate. Newborns in families with tuberculosis should still be isolated, but the vaccine has great value in preventing infection and can be widely promoted. Several European countries have used it for a long time, with Denmark having the best results. Currently, European and American countries widely adopt it, with Soviet health authorities promoting it vigorously. The U.S. Department of Health designated the University of Illinois in July of this year with $360,000 to prepare for the manufacture and supply of BCG vaccine nationwide to universally promote it across the country and defend against tuberculosis invasion. Our country's health authorities also have such preparations. If it can be universally inoculated in those who have not been infected, the results of tuberculosis prevention will be significant.</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>The tubercle bacillus is a common enemy of humanity. Almost no one in the world can escape its influence. Those who do seem to be exceptions. In children under ten, skin tests using tuberculin already show a positive result in 97%. Modern pathologists have discovered initial complex lesion clusters, further proving that everyone suffers from tuberculosis upon autopsy. No matter what cause of death is used as a standard, the mortality rate is never higher than that of tuberculosis. That is, the number of human deaths from tuberculosis is more than any other cause of death, more than wars, disasters, and more than other legally mandated acute infectious diseases. We have already understood that the most terrible aspects of tuberculosis transmission are: (1) It often invades strong adults, depriving the nation of the most vigorous labor force, indirectly affecting productivity. (2) It is more prevalent in cities than in the countryside, and more prevalent in schools and factories than in ordinary places. This severely devastates the core areas of national production, education, and political progress. (3) Pulmonary tuberculosis leads to a tuberculous constitution, increasing the incidence of disease, increasing mortality, and sharply reducing the population. Long-term chronic diseases, in terms of population quality, are precursors to racial degeneration and symbols of declining national quality.</p>
<p>During wartime, pulmonary tuberculosis is widespread in our country, harming national health. The entire nation suffers significant losses spiritually, physically, and materially. Short life spans and premature deaths constitute a major national crisis. We should, in line with the needs of national reconstruction, improve the national quality, strengthen the nation, and actively implement tuberculosis prevention. Unified planning and universal implementation are needed. On the surface, the aim is to relieve the suffering of patients, but in reality, it should reduce the number of patients, eliminate transmission, and promote a strong and prosperous nation. Therefore, strict implementation of tuberculosis prevention is essential to ensure national health and strength, which would be the greatest fortune for the nation.</p>
<p>In conclusion, tuberculosis prevention is an important task for national self-strengthening today. Tuberculosis prevention is self-defense, a means to survive. "If you don't kill tuberculosis, tuberculosis will kill you." Therefore, from a humanitarian standpoint, starting with our own survival, we must seek improvement, implement social healthcare, and eliminate the terrible pulmonary tuberculosis. The current economic inequality is already a social injustice and misfortune. Further economic inequality that prevents people from enjoying health security is even more unfair. At the same time, from an international perspective, to cope with changes and enhance our international position, the government should implement a public health system to ensure the health and safety of the people. Therefore, we hope that the government will plan and take steps to prevent tuberculosis. Social figures should also be motivated by a sense of duty, working together to eliminate the threat to our lives and the obstacles to our safety—pulmonary tuberculosis. (To be continued)</p>

<h3>On Medicine and Pharmaceuticals in the Countryside (Part 1)</h3>
<p>— Xu Jin</p>
<p>It is an undeniable fact that doctors and pharmacies are mostly concentrated in cities. Let alone residents in poor and remote areas not enjoying the blessings of modern medicine and pharmaceuticals, even counties and towns far from the coast or not accessible by railways are still being fooled by general sorcerers and traveling charlatans. It is said that when compatriots in the Northwest Frontier get sick, they ask a sorcerer to chant a spell, a method called "judgment by heaven." What is "judgment by heaven"? It is to carry the patient under the sun and expose them for three days. If the patient has not sinned in their lifetime, according to the sorcerer, their illness is curable and they can recover without medicine. If the illness does not improve after three days of exposure, then they have sinned too much and are doomed, and they can only die on their own. Another story says that if a patient in a certain place has a high fever, they must ask a sorcerer to treat them. Before the sorcerer arrives, the patient's clothes are removed, and they hold a whip in their hand, chanting while chasing the patient and whipping them. The patient is flustered and anxious, running until they are out of breath and suddenly collapse. The sorcerer then puts away the whip and instructs that the patient be picked up, their sweat wiped dry with a towel, and then covered well with a quilt. They lie down for a night, and it is said that the fever will subside the next day. While the sorcerer is desperately whipping the patient, the patient's family only eavesdrops outside the house until the patient collapses and the sorcerer shouts loudly, then the family dares to come in and thank the sorcerer repeatedly. This seems like a funny play to us outsiders, but how much silent ignorance and tears are contained in this funny play!</p>
<p>From a scientific standpoint, this treatment method is not entirely absurd. Exposure to sunlight does have some effect on certain diseases. Chasing and whipping the patient has the effect of forcing the patient to sweat and dispersing local congestion (Decongestion). These are all physical therapies (Phystotheiagie), but using a fixed method to treat ever-changing diseases is certainly not enough. Furthermore, using this method indiscriminately without considering the severity of the illness is also unreasonable. To allow sorcerers to perform the duties of doctors is a disgrace to the medical community!</p>
<p>Last autumn, the author was specially invited by a certain military commander to stay for two months in Jiawang Town, north of Xuzhou City. What I saw and heard sparked many feelings and truly experienced why urban doctors are unwilling to go to the countryside. Jiawang Town is only seventy miles from Xuzhou City and is accessible by the small railway of the East China Coal Mining Company, so it is not considered a remote area. However, it has already made doctors feel very inconvenient. There are no decent pharmacies there, and doctors are often worried about where to fill prescriptions. Fortunately, there is a mining area hospital there, and military officers can get medicine from the hospital, but they only have over-the-counter drugs and no one to compound prescriptions. Therefore, even a very ordinary prescription has to be taken by train to Xuzhou to be filled. Sometimes, Xuzhou cannot fill it either, so it has to be abandoned. Therefore, to practice medicine there, one must bring their own supplies, or know the types of medicines on the market, and only select from those medicines when prescribing. To have medicine but no drugs is still useless.</p>
<p>The mining area hospital is privately owned by the coal mining company and is specially set up to provide medical care for miners and their families. During the period of occupation, it was managed by the Japanese and was said to be quite well-equipped, with a large stock of Japanese drugs. After the victory, it was taken over by Chinese people, but many instruments were incomplete. Several rooms in the hospital were occupied by the military, leaving only three rooms for the hospital to use. The hospital was no longer a hospital, but the outpatient clinic was extremely busy. Each department had more than 300 patients per day, but there was only one doctor to see them. The doctor did not even have time to listen with a stethoscope, simply asking about the condition and signing the prescription. According to the doctor himself, his daily work was just about how to get the patients to leave because he was really too busy. However, according to the newly arrived Director Wang (sent by the Ministry of Health to take over), the two doctors were retained, and their qualifications may be questionable. Everything is currently being reorganized. The Ministry of Health has negotiated with the mining company authorities for the company to fund the construction of buildings and add wards. The Ministry will send a large number of drugs and equipment from the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA), and the two parties will cooperate. At that time, physicians and nurses from various departments will be hired, and then everything can be put on track. He also wants to cooperate with medical schools, so that medical students can regularly go there for internships and jointly study the local prevalent infectious diseases. If this plan is implemented, it will indeed be very good, but until the author left, the buildings had not yet been fully completed.</p>
<p>If the authorities of the Ministry of Health can have concrete plans to distribute a large number of doctors and medicines to various places, we would be happy to see it happen. The Physicians' Association should also assist in the completion of this plan.</p>
<h3>Everyone, Please Get Vaccinated Quickly!</h3>
<p>— Zhang Baoshu</p>
<p>Pray for blessings in the New Year; only disease prevention matters. To prevent smallpox, only vaccination works.</p>
<p>As the new year begins, everyone prays for blessings. Blessings do not come from heaven; they must be sought by ourselves. We are the gods, and the gods are us.</p>
<p>As the earth returns to spring, all things are born. Bacteria are also living things, so how can they not be born? Once born, they are active around us. If we do not seek hygiene, they can invade the human body anytime, anywhere, causing disease and threatening life. Mild cases drain strength and money, while severe cases result in the loss of both people and wealth.</p>
<p>The enemies of spring are familiar to everyone: smallpox, meningitis (commonly known as acute infantile convulsion), diphtheria, scarlet fever, and measles (commonly known as "zhenzi," not very dangerous). These six enemies are most difficult for young lives to withstand, but the old and young cannot escape them. There are countless other enemies joining in the excitement, but humans are in the middle, surrounded on all sides. Why not arm ourselves with hygienic methods to protect our lives?</p>
<p>The biggest enemy at present is "smallpox." The best and most appropriate weapon is "vaccination." It is hoped that everyone will use the same faith as in praying for blessings and get vaccinated quickly without delay!</p>
<p>The process of epidemic prevention tells us: "The following people must be vaccinated," otherwise their lives will be unsafe.</p>
<p>1. Newborn babies—do not wait for the umbilical cord to fall off—vaccinate immediately. If it does not take in five days, vaccinate again, and keep vaccinating until it takes.</p>
<p>2. Babies who have been vaccinated! Revaccinate every spring or winter, preferably when smallpox begins to appear, without waiting for warm weather. If it does not take in five days, vaccinate again, and keep vaccinating until it takes.</p>
<p>3. Male and female compatriots who have been vaccinated should revaccinate whenever smallpox begins to appear. Please do not forget to check after four days to see if it has taken. If it has not taken, revaccinate until it takes to be safe.</p>
<p>4. People who were vaccinated with "transferred seed vaccine" as children! Those whose vaccination did not take adequately or who have not been revaccinated for a long time should revaccinate for safety.</p>
<p>5. People who were vaccinated with "nasal vaccine" as children! Those whose vaccination did not take adequately or who have not been revaccinated for a long time should also revaccinate until it takes to be safe.</p>
<p>To eradicate smallpox, in addition to vaccinating, it is also important to isolate. That is, people with smallpox should be sent to the infectious disease hospital immediately and treated in the hospital until the scabs fall off completely before being released. This method is the most appropriate!</p>
<p>It is hoped that everyone will cooperate with all of the above and that everyone will do it. Then happiness will be endless, and there will be no need to pray for it!</p>
<p>Editor's Note: The author, Dr. Zhang Baoshu, is the director of the Municipal Second Infectious Disease Hospital. Because smallpox has been rampant recently, he has taken the time out of his busy schedule to write this article, hoping that all citizens of Shanghai will get vaccinated quickly to avoid contracting smallpox. This is also a "foolish" style of work, but it is hoped that the citizens of Shanghai will not fail the fool's good intentions!</p>

<h3>Ode to School Shops</h3>
<p>— Wang Qi</p>
<p>Although Oxford and Cambridge in England have some private characteristics, the Chinese have always looked down on private schools. Children studying at national or public schools seem to be a level above private school students. Private schools are like garbage trucks for public schools. Those who cannot enter public schools or are expelled from public schools use private schools as a final refuge. In Beijing, a certain middle school was being founded and specifically stated that anyone who had applied to a certain famous national university's affiliated middle school could be exempted from the entrance examination, regardless of whether they were admitted to the affiliated middle school or not. That is to say, anyone who had the guts to apply to the affiliated middle school must have a big background, and the private middle school considered itself a dedicated garbage truck for the affiliated middle school. As a result, its students were indeed many and especially many, and its curriculum also followed the affiliated middle school step by step, although its level was not necessarily very high.</p>
<p>The reason why Chinese people despise private schools is nothing more than because they want money, especially because they want money and have no results. A certain private middle school used a certain affiliated middle school as a banner, which was an advertisement striving for advancement, telling parents that although I charged a lot of money, the goods are not completely rotten, which is not unreasonable. Some schools have a sign "Test at any time" at the gate all year round, and the visitors are very few, which is a great eyesore. According to my ideal, in the Chinese environment, only private schools should be well-run, and public schools should not be involved. Why? First, this kind of school is not affected by personnel matters. The principal does not need to curry favor with the powerful, talk about internal and external lines, nepotism, or worry about the short-term nature of the position. Even if you run a school shop (according to the current situation, the disadvantages of running a shop cannot be completely eliminated for a while!), as long as the boss's situation improves slightly, they can take out a little conscience, seek some benefits for others, and sell some real goods, unlike public schools (which are actually also shops. Today, the status of teachers and students has become nonsense. Students feel that they are wealthy young ladies and young masters who have spent money to go to school, and teachers are poor and sour. If they violate the rules or fail, they can go elsewhere)! The principal's office is like going to a yamen, or like colleagues in a shop, seeing profit and loss as unrelated. Since it is their own business, they should at least hope for its success, not watch it wither. So, to put it bluntly, I am not against school shops. Selling goods is called "shop." Spending money and not getting goods is called "scam." Today's shops are "scams," not real "shops." Second, since it is their own shop, its construction and development can be based on their own ideals and freedom, without interference from this or that. The Chinese "upper echelons" are really fatal. A budget, a plan, turning it east and west, takes at least three months. Even if it is approved, it will not become money. Buying something costs at least one or two times the price, and the plan will be blown away. Their own shop, they have money, they can improve and build at any time. Taking libraries and laboratories as an example, they are the most important conditions for any school, but whether public schools can immediately raise tens of millions to buy books and medicines is definitely a problem. Also, the expansion and reorganization of classes are not so convenient in public schools. The standards for hiring and salaries are completely free. If you really want to recruit talents, why can't you invite university professors and education experts at a high price? This is something that cannot be done in public schools. Third, if the school shop is well-run, it will have both fame and fortune. Although they cannot get any medals, they can always get a plaque for being enthusiastic about education and "cultivating talents." Look at Mr. Zhang Boling today and Mr. Ye Chengzhong back then. Can't they be examples for today's school shop owners? Fourth, if we still have ideals and ambitions, private schools are the most suitable experimental grounds. Why? Because there are no restrictions mentioned above. In the past, the Shanggong Elementary School affiliated to the Commercial Press and the Wanzhu Elementary School affiliated to the China Association were both tested for many new teaching methods. How can public schools get that kind of strong assistance and strength? Based on the above, what harm do private school shops do to society? However, the current method is either to pull up seedlings to help them grow or to cut them down carelessly, treating students as objects to be scammed and teachers as factory workers (workers are treated much better than teachers, but their labor-capital relationship is similar), desperately squeezing their labor without regard to their lives. I once met a principal who wanted to run the school rationally, especially paying attention to the livelihood of teachers. He wanted to buy rice or gold notes with all the teachers' salaries to avoid losses. I said very good, but yesterday I saw in the newspaper that Guangzhou was in chaos because the principal of a private school invested tens of billions of tuition fees in gold notes, causing the market to be in chaos and the price of gold notes to skyrocket. The police will investigate and punish him. Then, needless to say, the principals only want to win alone, without considering others, and facilities for sharing benefits are fundamentally impossible. Even if there are enlightened people, it will cause financial fluctuations. I can't take such a big responsibility! All in all, this is the cancer of the whole society. What can be done to solve it? If the government thinks that private schools are unreasonable, they should fundamentally abolish them. Only limiting fees and not allowing them to exceed the limit, 4 million and 4.5 million, is the same as fifty steps and a hundred steps. It really doesn't make much of a difference. Rather than that, why not further supervise their use and distribution?</p>
<h3>The Alps Are Moving</h3>
<p>— Yang Bao</p>
<p>The geologists of the Swiss Federal Research Institute have suddenly announced to Europe their discovery that has shocked the academic world: the Alps are moving!</p>
<p>This mountain range, known as the backbone of Europe, is incessantly moving northward, at a rate of twelve inches every century. The Rocheuses peak, which reaches 9,721 feet, is, according to research, constantly "marching towards Munich," but this need not alarm the residents of Bavaria, as they calculate that it will take two million years for this magnificent peak to "walk" to the streets of Munich.</p>
<p>Another major discovery is that the Rhine River swallows about 100 million cubic inches of mountain soil from the foot of the Alps every year, carrying it into Lake Constance. At this rate, in 16,000 years, this beautiful lake will be filled with this mountain soil.</p>
<h3>On Automobiles</h3>
<p>— Ze Shi</p>
<p>I live in a small house along the street, specifically on West Beijing Road, one of Shanghai's main streets. The cars come and go like weaving, and the sound of horns never stops, only ceasing deep into the night. I hear it for about sixteen hours a day, which is truly unbearable. This makes me wonder why there are so many cars. Wouldn't it be much better for me if Shanghai had no cars, so my ears could be at peace? Wouldn't it be enriching the country and benefiting the people if the whole country had no cars?</p>
<p>Everyone knows that the country with the most cars in the world is the United States, but probably no one knows which country has the fewest. According to Americans, the country with the most cars seems to be the most civilized. This is just a case of "selling melons and saying they are sweet," as the United States is the most developed country in the automobile industry. Even if cars truly represent civilization, there is nothing we can do if we are not civilized for a while. Ordering cars from the United States is very welcome, but borrowing money from them is very difficult, and they refuse to accept legal tender or customs gold for car payments. There is also the issue of gasoline. Therefore, if China never uses a single car, the national treasury will definitely be more abundant. This is the reason why not using cars is enough to enrich the country.</p>
<p>Secondly, let's talk about benefiting the people. Today's women who ride in cars are the same as the sedan chair class of the past. A car only needs one driver, but carrying a sedan chair requires at least two people. Replacing sedan chairs with cars is a way to solve some of the unemployment problem. The wages saved from sedan chair carriers can be used to pay for the gasoline, which will certainly be more than enough.</p>
<p>To narrow the scope, today there is much talk of layoffs in various organizations, which scares civil servants. I think, why not replace people with cars, i.e., cut cars instead of people? The number of superfluous staff in an organization is probably not more than the number of cars used by the various leaders, right? Moreover, the cost of one car on the books is certainly more than the salary of one employee.</p>
<p>You might say that cars travel like flying, saving time and greatly helping those who ride in them to be more efficient. This sounds right, but it is not. I remember when a certain new indexing method was first invented, its advertisement said: "Using this indexing method, you can save five minutes a day, one hundred and fifty minutes a month, and one thousand eight hundred minutes a year. If we live a little less, say sixty years, we will save a total of one hundred and eight thousand minutes. Sixty minutes is one hour, twenty-four hours is one day, which means we save one thousand eight hundred hours, or seventy-five days, more than two months. Isn't it precious to gain more than two months of life by using this new indexing method?" At the time, I was silent. I think the average person probably doesn't look up words in the dictionary for five minutes a day, so where would they save this amount? Even if they could save it, they would waste more than five minutes in other places. Riding in a car can save more than just five minutes a day, but the question is what do you do with the time saved? For example, it takes an hour to walk from Tian Street to Yi Street, but only five minutes by car. Using a car to travel saves forty-five minutes, but there are many ways to use these forty-five minutes: if I like to sleep, I can use it to sleep more; if you like to play cards, you can use it to play four more rounds... Of course, if you like to work, you can use it to do a little more work. However, first, people who like to work are probably very rare; second, even if you like to work, you are not allowed to do more, because there is a fixed time for work. For example, if you start at nine in the morning, the forty-five minutes saved by riding in a car cannot be used for work, i.e., the person riding in the car will not arrive at eight fifteen. Moreover, in fact, people who drive to work arrive later than those who walk.</p>
<p>As I was writing this, a lady came to visit my wife. She talked about how her cousin's husband had recently been promoted and made a fortune, so he took a concubine and was "spoiling the concubine and neglecting the wife." After saying this, she sighed and said, "Once a husband starts riding in a car, the future of the wife becomes precarious." I couldn't help but smile, so I added this note.</p>

<h3>Unforgettable</h3>
<p>— Ke Luo</p>
<p>In a small town in America, there was a very kind doctor. A farmer lived in the town, and he often asked the doctor to treat his illnesses. The farmer's family was poor, both husband and wife were weak, and they had many children. Almost everyone was often sick, and the poor father could only sigh at the ceiling, unable to afford the medical expenses.</p>
<p>However, whenever they asked the doctor to treat them, the doctor always responded and often stayed up all night to take care of the patients. The farmer, besides paying a small amount of consultation fees as a token of appreciation, often sent some eggs and other agricultural products to the doctor.</p>
<p>Now, this doctor has been dead for many years, and the farmer's later years are very good. His children have all grown up, and his life has gradually become better. The poverty and illness of the past seem like just a nightmare.</p>
<p>However, the farmer's family can still be seen at the doctor's daughter's home. They often send a little bit of eggs, vegetables, and the like to her - even now. Although the doctor has been sleeping for a long time, the family who benefited from his kindness will never forget him.</p>
<h3>Xiaoyao Flower</h3>
<p>— Chen Shenyan</p>
<p>Chapter 11 Full of Doubts (81)</p>
<p>Zhu Zhai said: "The boss wants to rest, I'll go back too!" Mother Xiao Wang said disappointedly, "Why are you leaving so soon? Did you find out what that Miao Mu is?" Zhu Zhai shook his head and said, "I can't figure it out, he didn't tell me in detail, I'll talk about it later." After speaking, he hurried down the stairs and went straight out the door. Walking on the road, he felt very lost in his heart, not knowing where to go. He paced along the road, only thinking, Qi Wan's words today were too ambiguous. She is usually very frank with people, especially with me, she talks about everything and discusses everything. Today, when she speaks to me, she is suddenly cold and hot, and her attitude is very different from usual. She didn't come back all night last night, and she wouldn't say where she went. Most likely, she was with that person named Miao. Zhu Zhai thought of this, and jealousy suddenly arose. He stomped his foot, feeling that he had worried about her and ran around for her last night in vain. He stood foolishly by the road for a while before he came back to his senses and went straight to the dormitory along the road, feeling extremely depressed. He lay on the bed and thought for a while, but still couldn't figure out why Qi Wan had this change. His mind was confused, as if he wanted to pull out a clue from the tangled mess and study it, but the more he thought, the more confused he became. He sat up and saw a bottle of brandy on the small table in front of the bed. This was originally given to him by Qi Wan, preparing him to drink a sip when the weather was bad in the morning, so as not to catch a cold. Zhu Zhai stared blankly at the bottle of wine for a while, feeling that Qi Wan usually took care of him in every possible way, so why did she have this change today? What is the reason for the change? He speculated in various ways, but couldn't figure it out. So he took a wine glass and poured a glass of brandy on the tea table, drank it all in one gulp, and then lay back on the bed, wanting to calm his mind and sleep for a while to relax his brain. However, his thoughts lingered in his mind, constantly circulating, and the more he wanted to sleep, the less he could fall asleep. So he sat up again and drank a full glass of brandy. After drinking this glass of brandy, his brain nerves were actually numb. His eyelids twitched, and he felt dizzy. After a while, he fell into the land of sleep. Zhu Bao relied on these two glasses of wine to get a good night's sleep. The next day, when he woke up, his brain moved and his thoughts came to his mind again. He felt that with Qi Wan's usual behavior, she wouldn't have this change. Now he doesn't need to investigate her, just advise her not to get close to that person named Miao, so as not to be tempted by him; he must also examine himself to see if there is anything wrong that Qi Wan sees. If he really has a fault, then he must correct it to avoid misunderstandings.</p>
<h3>About Mr. Chu Nanqiang</h3>
<p>— Shi Shufan</p>
<p>This magazine recently discussed the affairs of Chu Jiansou of Yixing, lamenting his lack of recognition after the war and expressing nostalgia. I, Bunning, have a slight connection with Mr. Nanqiang, and I still often communicate with him. Therefore, I will describe his recent situation and his general situation of avoiding the Japanese invaders in the past, so as to inform those who are concerned about Mr. Chu. Jiansou is his pen name.</p>
<p>From the beginning of the war to the end of the war, Mr. Chu always lived in Shanjuan Cave in Zhangzhu, Yixing. Although he once sought refuge in Guangde, it was only for a short time. In the winter of the thirtieth year, I was living in seclusion in West Tianmu Mountain, drafting proclamations in Mr. Yang Ling's office. The place controlled three borders and was connected to Yi and Guang. The messengers came and went in an endless stream, and I often heard about Mr. Jian Sou's daily life. Mr. Zhao Fuyi of the Party and Government Council of the Third War Zone, who transmitted words of greetings to me, was within sight, only a meeting was lacking. Tianmu is four or five days away from Yi, and the path is rugged. It is tiring to ride up the slopes, and my body cannot bear the fatigue. Therefore, after two rounds of hot and cold seasons, I have not visited once. I once replied in a letter: "The misty waves of Lake Li, vast and impossible to connect." Thinking about it, I can't help but feel disappointed! Mr. Chu was living in the wilderness, but he was highly respected in the southeast. At that time, when the generals and officials passed by, they would get out of their cars to visit him, seeking his advice. Those who did not know often saw bows and knives in the alley, and suspected that he was leading his three thousand sons to kill the invaders. The rumors spread, and this led to the legend of fighting guerrillas. Later, I turned to eastern Zhejiang, and communication was interrupted for more than a year. The year before last, I traveled to Shanghai and resumed communication with this old man, picking up the threads of the past. Knowing that he was still difficult to set foot in Yangxian city, with plum blossoms marking the passage of time in the cave. Last autumn, Mr. Chu planned to compile the stories of Shanjuan and Gengsang caves and print them for the world to see. However, the price of paper rose day by day, so the plan was delayed. At the end of the year, he wrote that the Shanjuan Temple at the entrance of the cave had been repaired twice, but both times it was destroyed. Now he did not dare to build and decorate it again. After the war, the rivers and mountains were not more peaceful, and I longed for my hometown, feeling the same way! Mr. Chu devoted his life's energy to the two caves, exploring their mysteries and secrets, working hard without complaint. His purpose was to make the wonders of the world public, so even though there may be things to discuss about the axe and chisel, they cannot be criticized for this reason alone. I remember that between the years of the Republic of China twenty-one and twenty-two, my friend Yao Yuangan introduced Mr. Chu to Jiang Shunan, the old man of Geng Yandang. They sat together in one room, removing their clothes at the top of the peaks. At that time, Jiang was intent on building Yandang Mountain, and Mr. Chu was also madly pouring gold into the two caves. They admired each other from afar, and each led the mountains and rivers. Once they met, the spray wet the lamp, because the two old men were both talkative and had similar interests. They traveled dozens of miles a day, followed by sleepless nights, without feeling tired. But after a while, Shunan compared himself to the Stone Gate Pool, holding sand and throwing himself into the Xiang River, and the matter was difficult to investigate. Only Mr. Chu breathed clearly and remained old and leisurely in the lake waves and shadows. However, he is now also over seventy years old. Mr. Chu enjoyed fame very early. When he was in his prime, he was as important as Zhang Jian of Nantong and Jiang Zhuzhuang of Wujin, each ruling a state. Or he was jokingly called the local emperor, which was to respect him. Tracing his life, his merits outweighed his crimes, and there was a definite conclusion. At the beginning of the year, I received a letter from Mr. Chu, inviting me to visit Bixian Nunnery during the apricot blossom season, as the Yichuan section of the Beijing-Hangzhou Road was about to be completed, and the bridges from Chuanbu to Zhangzhu were also being laid. For ten years, I was blocked by the war, and it was difficult to reach Taoyuan. Unexpectedly, after waking up from a spring dream, I could still see this old man welcoming me at the entrance of the cave with a wine jug? At the end of the letter, he attached a photo of the Wild Goose Pagoda in Xi'an, thinking to dispel his old feelings, mostly relying on notes and descriptions. I regretted that I could not find a picture of a piece of sky to offer. Mr. Chu has a daughter named Nengzi, who is proficient in poetry and literature, and skilled in swordsmanship. In the past, my friend Yi Junzuo wrote a song of bright pearls and precious swords to praise her. Passing on the scriptures and subduing women, I guess she is also middle-aged, but I have not asked who she married. She is a companion to this beautiful concubine, truly a blessing!</p>
<h3>Qingcheng in the Northwest: Xinglong Mountain (Part 1)</h3>
<p>— Junzuo</p>
<p>Spring water clear without bottom, high buildings overlook the two mountains. Woodcutters happy to chop wood, boiling tea to the children's joy. Trees green floating screw dai, sky blue writing colored rings. How many fame and fortune guests, why like white clouds?</p>
<p>——Yi Junzuo: Visiting Xinglong Mountain——</p>
<p>Qingcheng Mountain, one of China's famous mountains, is located in Guan County, Sichuan Province. During the War of Resistance, I served in Chengdu for a period of time. Due to enemy bombing, my family was evacuated and moved to Shangqing Palace, the highest peak of this Qingcheng Mountain, as neighbors with Zhang Daqian. At that time, I wrote a poem about moving to Shangqing Palace and the beautiful scenery of Qingcheng Mountain:</p>
<p>I bid farewell to Jinli and dreamed of hibiscus, and stayed overnight at the first peak of Qingcheng. The wind carries smoke traces and blows into fog, and the mountains connect with human shadows and turn into rainbows. The sound of rain in the middle of the night thunders, and the color of the sun is bright and agate is thick. Several plum blossoms are red like fire, and a basket of tea leaves is as green as scallions.</p>
<p>Qingcheng Mountain was praised by Lu Fangweng as a famous mountain like a green wave (the mountains are like green rolling eastward), the forests are lush, and the sun is covered. Wu Zhilao called it the most secluded place in the world. Thirty-six peaks, each peak is beautiful, verdant and dripping. This mountain in Sichuan rivals Mount Emei.</p>
<p>After I came to Guanzhou, I was very disappointed to see that the mountains in the northwest were mostly loess bare mountains. The mountains around Lanzhou, such as Bi Li and White Pagoda, are famous, but they are barren. Later, someone said: Only Xinglong Mountain is very different, the whole mountain is full of ancient trees and shade. After visiting, it really lived up to its name, it is simply a miracle in the northwest. Because this mountain, its secluded beauty, and lush forests are very similar to Qingcheng. Up until recently, I have visited three times, and each time I doubted that I had entered the dreamland of Qingcheng.</p>
<p>Xinglong Mountain is ninety miles away from Lanzhou City and belongs to Yuzhong County. There is a highway that leads directly to the foot of the mountain. After passing Yuzhong County, a small long street runs along the stream, with green willows on both sides, and the scenery gradually becomes different. Facing two high peaks opposite each other: the western one is named Qiyun Mountain, and the fruit-like one is named Xinglong Mountain (commonly known as Xinglong Mountain, because during the Shunqing era, people were afraid of disrespecting the emperor's dignity, so they changed the dragon character to the vulgar Long character, which means business is booming. The height difference is limited; between the two mountains is a clear stream, naturally forming a gap. The two mountains are closely connected by a rope bridge, named Yunlong Bridge, meaning "wind follows dragon".</p>
<p>At the foot of Qiyun Mountain, there is a villa where Chairman Jiang once lived, which is clean and gorgeous. It is now managed by the Lanzhou Lizhi Society as a reception center to provide food and lodging for tourists. Behind the villa is Chaoyuan Temple, with three halls in the main hall, enshrining the statue of Lu Zu, wearing red boots and yellow robes, holding a Mao Emperor, sitting humorously in the temple thinking. There are six tablet rooms on the right of the hall, which record the history of this mountain. Above Chaoyuan Temple, you can enter the forest. The entire east and west mountains are wrapped in lush forests, green and lush. Qiyun Mountain is tall and outstanding, detached from the crowd, with winding steps and temples standing in rows. Although the mountain path is not wide, it is very clean. From time to time, Taoists cut off dead branches and widen the road surface; the slope is not very large, and it does not take much effort to climb the mountain. Ancient trees are shady, cool as autumn. Going west from Chaoyuan Temple, the county cliffs are steep, and the Xixin Pavilion is built on it, with Wu Yuanzi's hand-recorded Lu Zu Bai Zi Tablet and his own Qiyun Song. Behind the pavilion is a magnificent and empty Fuyuan Building. Going north, there is Wu Yuanzi Temple, which enshrines the god statue of Wu Yuanzi, who is thin and emaciated and looks withered. In front of the temple is a stone tablet with vigorous calligraphy and exquisite flatness and neatness, which is the only "Wu Yuan Family Treasure" personally written by Wu Yuanzi. On the mountain ridges on the left and right behind the temple, two halls of the same size were built, the left enshrines Guanyin, and the right enshrines Qiu Zu. From these places, you can also see the color of Buddhism mixed into Taoism. For example, although Qingcheng Mountain is a famous teaching mountain, there are also Buddhist temples; in addition to enshrining the statue of Lao Tzu in the main hall of Shangqing Palace, Confucius is also enshrined, and Confucian colors also sneak in. Behind Guanyin Hall is a paifang, Yan Yue: Up the sky ladder, and then up to Fengyue Ridge, the strange rocks are craggy, quite artistic. Going up from Fengyue Ridge to the Yuanyuan Temple, also known as the Black Tiger Temple, enshrines the gods who cut down demons and subdue demons, with dark faces and hideous shapes. There is a pavilion behind, which can be used for rest. A new pavilion is being built on the nearby cliff, facing several ancient pine trees, standing like a cover, the secluded and charming is very similar to the small stone platform in the Lion Forest of Huangshan. There is a row of small houses on the upper left, with two caves in the middle: one is the Two Immortals Cave, and the other is the Three Saints Cave. The Two Immortals Cave enshrines the statues of Qin and Li Erxian, who were both born in the Qingyuan period of the Song Dynasty and built thatched cottages in Chaoyang Cave on this mountain. Li Xian's name was Yuanhui, and later changed to Zhitong, and served as a Jianyi doctor; Qin Xian claimed to be a eunuch in the Qin Dynasty, and later changed his name to Zitong. Why did they become monks? Although it is impossible to verify, the personalities and backgrounds of the two people can be seen from their posthumous poems. Li Xian has a sad poem: "Wealth and fame have not been mentioned for a long time, my heart is cold and I learn to be obsessed, I have no human affairs recently, I want to live in the depths of Yunshan." Qin Xian's poem: "The dangerous pavilion leans against the heavy ridge, the fine rain is misty and the jade steps are long, the winding blue stream flows through the night rain, and the red leaves on both sides of the mountain reflect the setting sun." Setting sun should be a mistake for setting sun. After going around the mountain behind the Two Immortals Cave to Lingguan Temple, and then up to the Seven Zhen Temple, there are seventeen statues. Above is a stela game, named: Santai Ridge. One mile to the right is Wangmu Palace, and to the south of the palace is Chaoyang Cave, where Qin and Li Erxian practiced. A few dozen steps forward, there is another stela building, named: Silence. A corner of the dangerous building, hanging high on the cliff, is named Baiyunwo, which contains a reclining Buddha statue. Further up is Shouxing Nunnery, and the south slope is Leizu Hall. Continuing south, there is Zizaiwo, the statue of Wu Yuanzi. On the right wall in front of the cave are two steles, which are Wu Yuanzi's self-titled prescription for medicine and palindrome poem. These Taoist relics and crooked poems can be found everywhere in the famous mountains of the world, and they are not surprising; what is surprising is that next to Zizaiwo is a small earthen house, the roof is spiral, small at the top and large at the bottom, in the shape of gossip, and it is said that Wu Yuanzi wrote books and refined elixir here. Following the stone steps up, there is Wu Yuanzi's library, which is now closed. Wu Yuanzi's surname is Liu and his name is Yiming, he is from Woxian, Shanxi, and is also known as Supuzi and Beiyang Sanren. According to legend, in the Yiyou year of Qianlong in the Qing Dynasty, he passed by Yuzhong and visited the relics of Qin and Li Erxian in Qiyun Mountain, and then settled here to study Taoism and cultivate hard for more than forty years before he ascended to immortality. His life's writings and annotations are like a forest, such as: Three Yi Zhu Lue, Zhou Yi Jin Zhen, Diamond Sutra Jie Mu, Heart Sutra Jie Yun, Xiuzhen Jiu Yao, Shenbao Ba De, and Qiyun Notes, etc. Taoist books have long been incomplete. The grand hall at the top of the mountain is named Hunyuan Pavilion, with a hexagonal pillar that reaches the sky, which is considered the peak.</p>

<p>Reader Consultation Legal Interpretation</p>
<h3>Housing Disputes Involve Mutual Lawsuits Courts Delay for a Long Time</h3>
<p>Yang Rishi asked: A has a shop that was rented to B in the 25th year of the Republic of China. A contract was signed at the time, and B paid a deposit of 200 yuan. In the 33rd year, A wanted to take it back for his own use, but B did not agree. After mediation, B continued to rent for two years until the expiration of the term in March of the 36th year. B still refused to return the property. A then sued the court for a ruling. In the first instance, B lost the case and was ordered to move out within a time limit. The deposit was refunded by A at a rate of 2,500 times. B refused to accept the appeal. The second instance rejected the appeal. B refused to accept it and appealed to the Third Instance Court. B used the fact that he had repaired the facade during the lease period and forged accounting books to claim compensation from A. There are several questions now. Please give detailed answers: (1) Can the Third Instance Court uphold the original judgment; and execute it immediately? (2) Can A claim compensation from B for the losses suffered due to B's unreasonable lawsuit? (3) Can A prosecute B for the crime of forging documents for forging accounting books? (4) The Third Instance Court has been delaying this case for as long as ten months. Can A request a quick judgment?</p>
<p>[Legal Counsel Mr. Tang Mingshi's answer] (1) The Third Instance Court is a legal review. If the application of the law is correct, it should uphold the original judgment. The Third Instance Court is the final instance, and its judgment can be executed. (2) If A has suffered damage due to B's unreasonable lawsuit, he can naturally claim compensation. (3) If A can prove that B forged accounting books, he can prosecute for the crime of forging or altering documents according to the Criminal Law. (4) The Supreme Court of the Third Instance has many cases, and delays are inevitable. There is no other method other than requesting a judgment.</p>
<h3>Clarification of Military Service Questions from Mr. Pan Zhongren, Answered by the Civil Affairs Bureau</h3>
<p>(1) The military service investigation of men's families is conducted by the township (town) office every year within the prescribed period. According to the household registration books, a list of men of active military service age who are about to reach the age of 20 is prepared and posted publicly. This procedure must be carried out once every year.</p>
<p>(2) Students graduating from high school or above are not subject to general conscription orders. This city began in January of this year. According to the rules of the order, there are provisions that do not apply retroactively, and it seems difficult to apply for the 36th year. This telegram order was approved for implementation on a special project and was not listed in Article XX of the Military Service Law.</p>
<p>(3) The active military service man is stipulated to be five years old. In addition to the five years, there is no need to apply.</p>
<p>(4) If the township (town) chief has military service corruption, he can report it to the local government and the battalion (4) garrison headquarters.</p>
