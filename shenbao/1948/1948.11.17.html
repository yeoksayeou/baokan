<h3>立院通過臨時動議　剿匪爲反侵略戰　宣告中外以明是非而振士氣</h3>
<p>〔中央社南京十六日電〕立法院十六日通過委員徐源泉等所提臨時緊急動議，咨請政府確定剿匪戰事性質爲反侵略戰，宜吿中外，以明是非，而振士氣案。案文如次：查剿匪戰事，遠溯之已廿年，近計之自勝利復員，政協失敗以來，亦已兩年，以我政府之軍力·民力·物力而論，戡亂早應結束，其所以曠日持久，匪勢坐大者，固有由於政府愛惜民命，多所顧忌·而共匪不擇手段，殘暴恐怖，易於達成其破壞目的，然其主要原因，在共匪始終爲國際侵略集團之一環，有國際直接間接之支持，東北日軍之武器，假手於侵略國家轉入共匪之手，我國接收旅順大連，屢遭拒絕，可爲明證。是不僅以我一國之力，獨當全世界侵略力量之衝，乃國內外人士，蔽於共匪巧妙之宣傳，多視剿匪戰事，爲爭奪政權之爭，甚且顛倒是非，以共匪之極權恐怖爲民主者，不僅全世界愛好正義厭惡侵略之國家，對我袖手旁觀，卽全國人民，亦多抱茍且圖存之念，而少一致奮起之心。剿匪戰爭成敗之關鍵，實應自齊一視聽，確定觀念始。爲使全國及全世界愛好和平正義民主自由之人士，瞭解我國剿匪戰爭，爲反侵略國家與侵略國家之戰，亦卽爲自由與奴役之戰，爲和平與恐怖之戰，爲民主與極權之戰，我十年前爲爭取國家獨立，民族生存，世界和平之抗戰之延長，而非政權之爭奮。應請院會決議，咨請政府，確定剿匪戰事性質，爲反侵略戰，昭吿中外，以振作士氣，齊一民心，而國際間庶幾得道多助，俾加速完成戡亂大業，奠定世界和平基礎。是否有當？敬候公決·</p>

<h3>徐州前綫的大捷</h3>
<p>徐州前綫捷報頻傳，我邱淸泉兵團在黃口之役仃了勝仗，我黃伯韜兵團在碾莊八義集，也打了勝仗；兩度大捷，不僅粉碎了共匪進窺徐州的企圖，而且奠定了我軍在徐州的堅強陣地，日來我軍維續擴大勝利的戰果，到了十五日午夜十二時徐州以東的共匪終於崩潰，分三路向東北潰退。據我空軍總部報吿匪軍向新安鎮與台見莊作總退却的情形，我偵察機曾看到匪軍卡車數百輛，狼狽北撤，不絕於途。這個捷報傳到首都，各大報均出號外，市民並準備發起祝捷大會。在氣壓低沉人心苦悶的今日，我們接到從徐州傳來的捷報，對於我邱黃兩兵團在徐州前綫打「硬仗」獲得的偉大戰果，自然覺得格外有意義·此次大捷，不僅穩定了徐州前綫的戰局，而且也穩定了江淮流域的人心。</p>
<p>匪軍這次進攻徐蚌，是由匪方陳毅·陳賡。劉伯誠三部合力進攻的，其所結集的兵力，超過國軍一倍以上。匪軍所採取的戰略，仍舊是「以大吃小」徐州以東的匪軍，曾企圖包圍我黃伯韜兵團，但經我黃兵團官兵的喋血苦撑，邱兵團的疾馳赴援，終於粉碎了匪軍的企圖，使匪軍不得不向東北逃竄，形成了這次的空前大捷。從這一大捷，我們可以獲得許多可貴的教訓··</p>
<p>第一，自濟南·長春·瀋陽相繼棄守以後，就有一小部份的失敗主義者，對於當前軍事幾乎失去了信心，而誤以爲大局無法挽回。其實勝敗乃兵家常事，一城一地的得失無關宏旨，只要能接受失敗的教訓，澈底改變戰略，就不難扭轉乾坤。何況戰爭之勝敗，乃爭最後之一剎那，而其關鍵所在，卽在士氣。只要官兵個個不怕死，紮硬寨，打死仗，就一定打勝仗，徐州捷報的頻傳，卽足以證明我軍事當局勇於認錯，今後作戰的計劃，當不再受政治的牽制，純以軍事言軍事，打開軍事上的難關，是絕對沒有問題了。徐州大捷就是一個有力的保證。</p>
<p>第二，我們研究徐州大捷的原因，除了歸功於邱黃兩兵團的將士用命而外，對於我忠勇空軍的參戰，不能不認爲這次獲勝的一大因素。我空軍的參戰，不僅能配合陸地部隊，予匪軍以重創，而且藉此一優勢，卽可「以少勝多·」所以在今後的戡亂軍事上，我們應該特別增強這一優勢。我們希望美國在軍事援華方面，能以此爲重點，戡亂軍事的前途，也就大可樂觀的。</p>
<p>第三，這次共匪的戰敗，，原因固然不一而足，但其中最主要的，乃由於「輕敵」所致。所謂「驕者必敗」，是軍事上必然的道理。匪軍挾其兵力的衆多，滿以爲進攻徐州，咄嗟可得。殊不料我軍作戰，一以當十，竟把徐州以東的地方，造成了共匪的墳墓。這次大捷，應該可以使共匪從迷夢中淸醒過來了吧！迷信武力擾亂而不顧人民死活的人終歸於失敗，在我國歷史上，正不知有多少史實，可以引爲前車之鑑的。</p>
<p>第四，前綫的將士沉着打硬仗，對於軍事都有信心，這固可喜；但是後方的民衆，却在那裏慌張，輕信敵人所廣播的謠言。但現在他們聽到了這次大勝的捷報之後，不知怎樣能對得起前方忠勇的將士！這次戡亂是民族國家生死存亡的關鍵，忠奸是不能兩立的·凡是我們愛國的民衆，都應該站出來，爲前方將士的後盾，出錢出力，慰勞將士，鼓起他們更大的勇氣，爭取三民主義的最後勝利。</p>

<h3>共和黨各領袖預測　美國將加强援華　韋勒提議開兩院聯席會</h3>

<h3>德國剖視</h3>
<p>— 本報編譯室</p>
<p>——譯自「大西洋」雜誌九月號——</p>
<p>德國在三年以前被認爲一種再教育和管制的竄騐室問題，它的四個戰勝國將以互相協議的方式來解決它，到今日却已變成東方與西方間決定性的鬥爭塲所了。假如西方列強能够控制住柏林，它們有機會復與西德的工業，使歐洲復與計劃得以成功，把東方國家從蘇聯勢力圈中吸引過來，最後使歐洲照西方的條件統一起來。</p>
<p>一九四五年七月，德國的戰勝國把它劃分爲五部份：四個佔領區和柏林市。他們同意這五個區城都依據共同的經濟及政治原則加以管理。現在，爲適應實際上的需要起見，德國被分成三部份：東方，西方和柏林市。像這樣同一國內三個部份情形迥然不同，殆無前例可尋。</p>
<p>荒凉貧瘠的蘇佔區</p>
<p>某著名德國報級稱它爲「靜區」的蘇聯佔區，是一片荒地，點綴着蕭條的農塲，破敗的工廠，住着一千七百萬憔悴的絕望的德國居民，以及至少三十萬蘇聯軍瞰和官員。</p>
<p>麥克倫堡的平坦的榖田，吐林吉亞的起伏的靑山，勃蘭頓堡的沙地和松林，蕯克森的紡織及機器工業，蕯克森·安豪爾特的褐煤礦，冶金工廠和化學工廠，這一切實際上等於蘇聯所兼併的殖民地。</p>
<p>蘇聯佔區本來是一個富饒的農業區，每天供給每人三千七百加路里的熱量，現在配給它的居民每天平均一千四百加路里。這今昔不同的原因有如下述種種:戰事的損失，肥料的缺乏或輸往蘇聯，把優良的農塲分割成效用低劣的小單位的蘇聯制土地改革，以及蘇聯的強徵榖類食糖和牲畜。本年春間，蘇聯爲了防止眞正的饑饉，不得不把他們已經運出去的幾十萬噸的榖類運回兩萬噸。</p>
<p>蘇聯佔區裏面的著名工廠，僅存空洞的廠屋，那破碎的地板和彎曲的棟標，證明了蘇聯拆除機器時的粗暴行爲。該佔區的工業能力的百分之五十，在一九四五年夏間都洗到東部去；其中恐怕只有百分之五到達蘇聯時尚堪使用。從那時起，拆卸的工作不像以前那樣漫不經心，同時蘇聯當局把三萬德國技術人員和他們的家屬，隨着工廠搬到蘇聯去。梅森磁器工廠的一部份現在第弗利斯出貨，蔡司透鏡及照相機現在莫斯科及列寗格勒附近製造。</p>
<p>德國殘餘工業的百分之三十，是蘇聯的國有工廠，全部爲蘇聯而生產。其餘的，不管是被收買而已變成德國的公產，或被少數私人所執有，必須把生產品的百分之八十至九十，送到東方去。</p>
<p>求生不易求死不得</p>
<p>德國殘破的工業生產量日益減少，而蘇聯的榨取依然如故。這一個區域如果經營得法，可對蘇聯更爲有利。蘇聯爲什麽要加以破壞，這只有蘇聯的幼稚的低能和猜忌纔能够說明。</p>
<p>住在這個區域裹的德國人，盡是些悲慘的萎靡的可憐虫，真所謂，「求生不易，求死不得」。無孔不入的蘇聯秘密警察以及組織嚴密的德國共產黨特務人員，到處跟踵着你，注意你的片言隻語。數十萬人爲出言不填而被斥爲「資本主義特務人負」，「反動份子」，或「英美間諜」，一律送入蘇聯集中營去，這些集中營就設在著名的納粹集中營原址上面。已有二十萬男女被送到蘇聯去做苦役，又有兩萬五千人被送入蕯克森南部的鈾礦中去，爲礦聯採掘原子炸彈試騐用的礦石。</p>
<p>褐色的納粹獨裁政治，已經被赤色的蘇維埃獨裁政治取而代之了。共產主義的宣傳誇示着像戈培爾一樣狂熱的國家主義，應用大同小異的文字。在幾星期以前曾經揭穿一件事實：蘇聯人印行的德國報紙Taegliche　Rundschau所刊載的言詞激烈的反美文章，原來完全抄襲一九四二年發表的納粹小冊子。一般德國人對之並不覺得驚奇</p>
<p>蘇聯鑒於共奎主義的國家主義，不能爭得德國民衆的信賴，特地替以前的納粹份子創立了一個黨派，使他們的情感傾向蘇聯方面。但是蘇聯佔區內德國人的基本感覺，只有對於蘇聯的痛恨，表現於強烈而無能爲力的德國國家主義裹，凡是來自東方的任何事物一概深惡痛絕。</p>
<p>正在復興中的西德</p>
<p>在鐵幕以東的據國，是奄奄垂斃，毫無生氣·鐵幕以西的德國正在復興中，雖非平衡發展，但是脚踏實地的。最近實行貨幣改革以後，商店櫥窗裏突然充滿了出龍的囤貨，被視作黑市晴雨表的美國香姻從西馬克跌到四十芬尼，差不多等於法定價格。每月經常輸入三十萬噸的英美食物，和十億多美元的馬歇爾計劃援助，足以進一步改善西德人民的生活。</p>
<p>基本的糧食配給額並不充足，但農塲拋售的大量黑市食糧，保全了一般市民的健康，並使農民們變成富有。以前黑市猖獗而又不可少它，使得無數德國人不能生活下去。現在情形却不同了，因爲幣制改革以後，通貨的數量減少，他們似乎感到欣慰。被稱爲德意志馬克的新貨幣，已經獲得民衆的信任，使他們抱有經濟穩定的希望。</p>
<p>如果說蘇聯的殘酷已經招致強烈的仇視，那麽，西方的驚人的寬大，已經遭到了吹毛求疵的批評。德國人的胃口是個難填的慾　；英美人供給他的食物永遠是不足的，而且式樣不能使他滿意，此外，「不管怎樣，總是從德國來的。」不管十億美元的美援，仍然洗行着德國工業競爭將被消滅的謠言。</p>
<p>總境美軍司令克萊將軍，曾經煞費苦心，爲德國爭取這一筆援助，結果却被目爲「反德」，同時他的熱心的屬員被斥爲「一羣猶太難民」。</p>
<p>工業心臟的魯爾區</p>
<p>右派和左派對於在倫敦獲得協議的魯爾區的國際共管，反對的聲浪日趨高昂·礦工成爲煽動的目標，他所聽到的呼籲是：如果德國不能完全控制它的煤和鋼鐵，或者莫斯科不能分嘗一　，那麽還是不要生產的好。針對這宣傳，接濟食糧激勵礦工的計劃，已經提高了煤的生產量（但對於眞正的復興還不够高），壓低了共產黨的勢力（但對於眞正的安全還不够低）。鋼的生產量約爲准許德人生產的一千萬噸中的三分之一。</p>
<p>魯爾區經過可怕的轟炸以後，工廠和礦山需要資本和設備，工人需要房屋。魯爾區除了物質的復興以外，還需要精神上的安寗。鋼廠和煤礦都被英國人收買去，因此勞方和資方都沒有增加生產的眞正誘因。魯爾區工業的社會主義化，欲達到阻遏共產主義，削弱德國國家主義派，以及訓練非冷淡卽搗亂的工人成爲負責的公民這些目標，還須經過很長的路程。</p>
<p>撤開魯爾不論，巴威略瀰漫着天主教勢力，而且懷恨於德國北部，漢釁惋惜它被白萊門奪去的運轍業，許萊斯威與霍斯丁對着它須要供養的二百萬難民而嘆息，法國佔領區在法國軍政府的悉心擘劃下，實行自力更生·無疑地，西德人民不願意組織西方列強允許他們組織的政府，大部份是由於這權心理上的各自爲政·「統一德國」固然是一句有力的口號，可是不可思議的自私心理同樣是堅強的事實·</p>
<p>柏林的社會民主黨</p>
<p>德國有沒有變成民主國家的迹象呢？像在德皇時代或威瑪共和國時代一樣，德國社會民主黨搆成國內唯一堅強的民主勢力。</p>
<p>一九四六年十月舉行大選時，蘇聯有意消滅它的據國社會民主黨獲得近乎半數的選票，從那時起該黨實力漸漸強大起來。該黨曾一再以有力的公然的抗議，反對共產黨的恐怖行爲，並以鼓吹自由思想使柏林人抬起頭來。社會民主黨職員多人曾被蘇方綁架，被德國共產黨暴徒毆擊，並被兩方恫嚇或開除職務·該黨從未妥協過，就是柏林市也沒有妥協過。</p>
<p>德國社會黨當然不是單獨作議的。他們的西方強敵基督教民主黨和自由民主黨，在市政府中反共陣綫裏是聯合一致的。該黨在蘇聯的封鎖政策下，顯示極端沉着鎮靜和不屈不撓的態度，同樣得到柏林民衆的信賴。</p>
<p>柏林的生活帶有一種邊疆的風格。它也有它的黑暗面－黑市的腐敗，可怕的罪惡和投機取巧。可是它也有它的光明面－廣大的社交活動，深攀的友誼。同志的互助，挑釁的環境，緊張繁劇的工作，急速的步調，以及同心協力的精神。柏林生活沒有年齡或國籍之分，祗有東方和西方的界城之分。在柏林人眼中，柏林依然是柏林。在外形上它是一座死城，但在精神上它是活着而健在的。今日的柏林是控制歐洲的政治的關鍵，正如西德是控制歡洲的經濟的關鍵一樣。</p>

<h3>絲綢升騰</h3>

<p>生絲市况承人絲之漲跌，走勢先高後軟，收市重又回低。優級零担本街絲織業納胃不弱，初開走勢鋒俏，盤高後執戶紛了，供多求少，各方頓又觀望，喊價步步下游，市價跌進上日收盤價，執戶不售，結果微升數百元。　綢緞先因四原料飛揚，人心一致看俏，喊價不抬卽高，被面初開爲七千五及八千元，高後廠方拋售不絕，客帮納意卽淡，同業傾吐，市況壓軟。嗣因銀根鬆弛，本街納胃重開，收市再見升騰，午後因謠言紛紜，人心轉悄，喊價紊亂。</p>

<h3>粵漢路八綫　處女礦業地帶</h3>
<p>— 本報記者　毛樹奎</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕目前全國鐵路中除了京滬滬杭兩路外，粵漢鐵路是唯一能自給自足的鐵路。在這個動盪的大時代中，這條賞串華中與華南的大動脈，軍事上自有其非常重要性，而它經濟上的價值，更值得我們重視。民國二十七年十月廣州漢口相繼淪陷，那時總統曾面諭粵漢路局杜鎮遠局長，把鐵路澈底破攘，破壞到使敵人佔領後不能在六個月內修復使用，這個命令使粵漢路整整癱瘓了十年。至三十五年十二月總統又召杜局長入京，限令他在六個月內修復全綫。翌年七月一日，粵漢路員工，完成了十年來敵人所不能完成的工程，艱苦地把一千三百公里鋼軌接連了起來，美援款項雖然已從四千二百金元退到五百金元而這可憐的五百金元還始終在計劃中。粵漢路却已在這時候自力更生了，一步一步地改進，重建，踏上了復興大道。今年六月以前已將五百多孔便橋悉數更換爲鋼橋，這一切都得歸功於粵漢路的員工，但同時也說明了粵漢路本身的價值。</p>
<p>粵漢路沿綫多礦產如湖南耒陽，攸縣，寗鄉及湖北大冶的鐵，宜章，新化，益陽的銻，郴縣，臨武，常寗等地的鉛和鋅與散處各省的煤礦，粵漢路當局很知道，她未來的前途完全建築在這許多天然富源的開發上，路局現全力協助各煤礦的開發，興案直達礦區的鐵路支綫，以便利運轍，已經交通部核准或正在興工中的支綫共有一百五十多公里，計八綫：（一）白楊支機：自白石渡至楊梅山湖南煤礦，全綫長約十五公里，建築於抗戰時期，現粵漢南段用煤多賴這裹供給，現日產六百噸，計劃擴充至一千噸。（二）湘江支綫：自湘河口至楊嘉橋湘江煤礦，此綫復員後新築，日產煤五百噸，粵漢北段用煤取給於此現正擬利用美援加以擴充，他日可望增產至每日二千五百噸。（三）資興支綫：此爲戰前舊有，但已被破壞，待款興修。（四）南嶺支綫：</p>
<p>坪石至南嶺得宋子文主席的幫助，現正積極興築中。此區共有兩礦：一爲八字嶺，一爲狗牙洞，預計一年後，兩礦可日出煤一千噸。（五）中湘支綫：自峽山口至譚家山中湘煤礦，全長二十餘公里，待款興築。（六）湖湘支綫：自湘潭至羅家塘湖湘煤礦，業經交部核准，待款興建，該　日產煤一百七十噸，將來可望擴充至三千噸。（七）湘潭新化綫：此綫築成有洪山殿，恩口，鳳冠山，明鏡井，晏家舖等五處煤礦可資開採。（八）醴陵，萍鄉，高坑三礦區，都在株州與浙贛路接軌，三礦現日產一千五百噸。假使這八條支綫一且完成，粵漢路沿綫每日便有二萬噸的煤生產，非但粵漢鐵路和華南區工業用煤不必再擔心，而且還有剩餘來解決一部份京滬煤荒。那時，粵漢鐵路的運輸業務也將蒸蒸日上。這個計劃的完成並不太遙遠，粵漢路局預備在兩年內修築這麼許多支綫，當然單是交通問題的解決還是不够，同時，湘，鄂的地方經濟力量也不足以大規模地開發這許多礦產，他們殷切地希望全國各地目光遠大的企業家和海外僑胞，能够來這裹投資，共同開發這一塊處女礦業地帶。</p>
<h3>廣州電廠廠址　勘定河南兩村</h3>
<p>村民推代表提起訴願</p>
<p>〔本報廣州十二日航訊〕廣州河南南石頭及棣園兩村耕地七十餘畝，現奉廣州市政府公吿，將予盡量徵用，以爲廣州電廠廠址，該兩村人民極表不滿，渠等認爲南石頭省營紙廠之東，有土阜荒地，縱橫數里，多屬官荒，前臨珠江，後接公路，地盤寬敞，高爽而平，交通利便，且市府設計委員會早已定該處及以東沿江數十里之地爲工業區，此處官荒乃天然廠址，若在該處設廠，旣可減省補償徵收地價，又不破壞農村生產，公私兩便，今市府舍此天然之官荒廠址不予利用，而偏要向民等兩村四十餘戶三百餘人口所依靠以爲生活之耕地盡量徵收，似不特違法害農，抑亦有背政府扶助晨民增加生產之旨，業已推選代表謝明德·吳森·梁合德提起訴願，爭取生存。</p>
<h3>江西的黑流</h3>
<p>— 本報記者　劉藻</p>
<p>〔本報南昌十三日快訊〕江西現階段的治安，自從省政當局決心鎮壓各縣械鬥，制止派系鬥爭後，較諸半年前確是安靜多了，在這類無知識人民的肉體搏打與知識份子的神經暗鬥下，所發生的事件，雖然僅屬局部的糾紛，但是內在的鬥爭，是會影饗到一縣，甚至全省的安謐，譬如餘千的械鬥，經省保安司令部派參謀處長吳垂昆前往制止，雙方所繳出的武器，以輕重機槍一項而論，就有卅挺，步槍有二一二支，這些武器參加在肉體鬥爭中所傷害的人民生命財產，當然大有可觀，再以械鬥的時間與動員參戰的人數論，亦屬嚇人。去年分宜之役，雙方嚴陣以待的陣綫延伸到二三百里，動員的人數，有新喻·萬載·上高·宜春等有關各縣或是同宗族的人們，不論男女老幼，在戰塲上遭遇到，都當成「敵人」，俘殺不論！</p>
<p>幫會活動</p>
<p>我們再看帮會的活動，與危害地方的實際情形，這確是江西的一顆「大地雷」。自從去年組成所謂新社會事業建設會後，一般慣於從事政治活動，或是企圖利用成爲爭選的政治資本的人們，都乘這個機會滲透進去，作個人的秘密活動，開山收徒，甚至在社會上已有相當地位的野心家，亦甘願跪拜，去當徒弟，稱「大哥」。鄉鎖的老百姓，亦莫明其妙的都被這些人圈進去了，否則，安份守已的老百姓，就會叫你不能「安份」。這些份子的活動，在都市，在鄉鎮，形成了一股莫大的「黑流」，不但，老百姓不敢違抗，就是縣府方面亦奈何他們不得。譬如記者家鄉——泰和，就是這些份子橫行霸道的勢力圈。縣政府的人，都是圈子裹的傢伙，甚至保安司令部的副司令，亦是幕後的主持人，你看老百姓還有什麼話好說？祗好聽他們擺佈罷了！</p>
<p>省政當局對這般橫霸勢力，是下了決心來爲社會除害，首先就以重兵在泰和淸鄉，將帮會份子弄個淸白，並且揭破他們的一種陰謀——帮會份子企圖與桂南李濟琛勾結，運送槍械來泰和，準備與當地匪黨的地下工作人員，進踞朱毛的老巢——井崗山。</p>
<p>現在，械鬥事件，是比較的安靖，不敢明目張膽的插帥族，佈嚴陣，如臨大敵的來衝殺。帮會份子，自從在泰和淸鄉，逮補幾個帮頭，加以嚴處後，此風亦稍殺。不過，這兩股「黑洗」的禍根，現在仍然埋藏在江西的每個角落　，同樣興匪黨份子的地方活動爲可慮。大家都知道，江西在二十年前，是朱毛起桿的根據地，多少的「江西老俵」，被這二個魔鬼將他們拖進匪黨的隊伍裏，死的不說，活在的，亦有在匪軍充當幹部，所以江西是可能被他們認爲「家鄉」。這裏根據官方情報將贛境四週的匪提出來作個報導：</p>
<p>地下股匪</p>
<p>前面已經親過，江西目前地方治安的問題，有械鬧，派系與帮會的橫霸，形成危害地方治安的一般「黑流」，那末，匪黨更可能利用這些內在的橫霸，從事他們的地下活動。</p>
<p>現在，江西的腹心部份，雖然還沒有成股的匪軍或是土共的活動，但是，四周與鄰省的邊境，都已經種下匪黨的罪惡種子，由地下活動而成爲股匪的搶刦，宣傳，與組訓。一</p>
<p>贛南方面，在過去是匪軍粵東支隊的活動範圍，現在他們改稱爲粵贛浙邊區人民解放總隊，由黃業任總隊長，劉新潮任副總隊長，邵國樑任支隊長，全部人槍近千。幾經兜動，他們有時成股對抗，有時化整爲零，深藏山地，竄擾三省邊區，現仍以油山帽子峯爲根據地，劉雄虎的一部則不時在浙省邊區的桂東，汝城，與江西的遂山一帶搶刦。劉匪盤踞在此一地區的企圖，一方面到必要時可能向西淮擾粵漢路的南段交通，同時亦想乘機進到井崗山去，以建立所謂贛西根據地。</p>
<p>贛東的廣豐，崇安，是匪軍王文波股的根據地，他現在人槍一二〇，不時出沒在贛閩邊境，此剿彼竄。至於熊兆仁股，自稱爲「蘇浙皖贛邊區人民解放軍司令員」人，槍五〇〇，盤踞在皖屬　源，張公山，水嵐山，黃村，及大新山一帶，有時出擾贛境的德興，浮梁。</p>
<p>贛北地區</p>
<p>贛北地區的幕阜山是浙鄂贛邊區的一塊理想根據地東出侵擾九瑞與南潯交通，西窺鄂南的咸寗，武漢與浙北重鎮的長河，此一地區，據負責方面的調查，已有匪黨地下工作人員潛跡其問，從事武力組訓，但是，目在贛境內的修銅武區域的地方，幸吿無恙</p>
<p>不過，贛北現在所受到威脅，是在江北的黃梅廣濟，卽大別山地區，劉伯誠所遺留下來的毒菌土共，他們自稱爲鄂豫軍區司令員王琳聲，張國權是第一軍分區司令員，就是負責鄂東黃廣地區，還有駐在圻南的所謂鄂東行政專員趙辛初，基幹團長馬其在及黃廣土共鄒一淸，蔡瓊。他們現有的實力，全部約在五千人左右，槍彈蘭數，上月中間張國權部三千餘人，曾在黃廣以北地區，一渡竄擾，在當時我們又感覺的推測，恐怕他們想「以大吃小」的慣技到江邊的孔壠龍坪，武穴，來「吃」我們的保安團，所以江西省保安司令部立卽調派三個團，開上江北去，加強防務，並準備防止他們南竄。但是，張部在黃廣以北地區大河舖，荊竹舖，后山舖，搶刦一部份糧食，棉花之後，看到江防部隊的加強，亦不敢一試，回身又竄大洋廟，桐梓河蓮花菴，劉公河，原來盤據地區從事整訓。</p>

<h3>影射與冒牌</h3>
<p>— 熙</p>
<p>商業本重道德，然而爲了唯利是圖，也就很少能顧到道德問題。因此，「君子國」作風，永遠祇是「鏡花綠」中的蜃樓海市·</p>
<p>商業的不進德，屬於欺詐的，是劣品應市，售價不實。而對同業店號，或出品商標的影射和襲用，便屬侵占罪嫌。</p>
<p>在商業登記法中，明文規定：在同一縣市不得用他人已登記之商號名稱。而商標法亦闡明：已註冊之商標，有專用權。但是，在這社會裏，公開抵觸法律的，却就莫過於「商號名稱」或「出品商標」的被影射和襲用了。</p>
<p>影射方面：你用二「三貓」作商標，我就用「三虎」。你稱「黃麻子」，我便喚「王麻子」。襲用呢，更屬觸目皆是，俯手卽得。最普遍的，「陸稿薦」已代表了「肉莊」；而本帮菜館，必各「正興館」。我始終不明白，首創者爲什麼不根據商業登記法第二十二條，或商標法第三十七條，而向法院提出訴訟。也許事實上誰都是胃牌，因此在很多「真正」「老店」中，到底誰是「起首老店」，眞似「大舞台」對面兩家藥梨店同樣的市招般，祗有「天曉得」了。</p>
<p>有一種「×××花露香水」，戰前風行一時，且確具功効（去濕消腫）。勝利後，爲了替孩子治蚊咬，因此去買了一瓶，但搽用後竟毫無功効。自思可能出品的偷工減料，或儲藏臼久，而起化學作用，消失功効。直等到原來的「×××花露香水」出品商登報公吿，方知原來出品的商標專用權因在戰時滿期，不及呈請續展，遂致被人襲用了。</p>
<p>另外又有一家化學廠出品的「蚊香」，牌子和臼商的某盛名商標極像，曾引起同業的攻擊。不知其本身品質如何，但爲了它襲用的卑鄙，我寗願去購買其他新牌出品。意外的，該廠另一出品「××肥皂」，品質却非常高超，由此推想：所出品的蚊香，也許不一定太錯。可是爲了襲用他入商標，反使一般人不願意購用，這眞是襲用者所意料不到的。</p>
<p>根據上述二事實，我們知道，只要出品精良，何必影射或襲用他人的盛名店號和商標。反之，卽使襲用得法，（如已享盛名之出品，商標未經註册，或專用權已逾期。）而出品拙劣，亦至多使人上一同常吧了。</p>
<p>但是，要根本剷除影射和襲用的不道德，唯有顧客自己消滅「只認招牌不看貨」的盲目崇拜「老牌」心理；否則，吃虧的還是顧客自己。</p>
<h3>前淸京師圖書館銀印</h3>
<p>— 繆子彬</p>
<p>日前讀凌　澳閣談薈，述及遜淸所用印信等等，茲將京師圖書館銀印事附帶一談，想亦談遜淸掌故者所樂聞也。</p>
<p>先嚴藝風公，自光緒甲午在翰林院與掌院徐桐不合，請假歸田，絕意仕進，潛心於金石目錄之學者三十年。及受彙師張文襄公（之洞）入相，屢約出山。宣統元年五月，學部奏派爲京師圖書館正監督，副監督爲徐梧生（枋）。函電交馳，敦促就道，至二年九月始入都，而文襄已於年前　逝。時圖書館未建，借北城積水潭廣化寺開辦。書籍皆內閣大庫檢出，宋元舊帙，古色古香。是年冬，部頒印信一顆，銀質正方，文曰京師圖書館印。此官係新設，與京師大學堂監督相同，均爲實缺，故印式方而質銀。先嚴每以此自嘲，日吾亦曾爲正印官也（凡方印者均爲正印官）。翌歲辛亥，革命成功，淸廷遜位，此印開用，不及一年，爲印信壽命之最短者，亦恐爲淸代部鑄銀印之最末一顆矣。</p>
<h3>獨身者</h3>
<p>— 仲堅</p>
<p>從醫學及民族立塲言，晚婚與獨身都是有害的，因此歐洲歷來就有限制獨身的法律。</p>
<p>公元九年，羅馬皇帝奧古斯都以法律規定之獨身者無財產繼承權，甚至夫妻婚後未育有子女者亦不得互相繼承財產。斯巴達與雅典對獨身者科以罰金，其目的當然在鼓勵給婚，增加生育．</p>
<p>英國則採取徵稅的方式。一六九五年的法律規定，獨身者及無子女之鰥夫，按其情節輕重，每年納稅一先令到十二磅十先令。一七八五年通過了一項法案，對於獨身的撲人亦科以重稅。近年實行所得稅，對於己婚而有子女者從輕徵收，而獨身者則納較高的稅率。</p>
<h3>楊濠叟手稿</h3>
<p>— 錢大成</p>
<p>楊濠叟以擅作小篆，蜚聲海內。其著述則均未付梓，其後人又式徵，遂流遍江南。余嘗得其「管子今編」稿本，及手批「積古齋鐘鼎款識」，前年爲衣食所累，已斥售易米。王君琳元則得其手批「莊子五讀」，沈氏「師米　」藏其稿本更夥。今秋余向曹菊生先生假得濠叟文集稿本一巨冊，閱讀且匝月，其文不能盡雅；然濠叟佐張文毅公（芾）幕也久，於胡淸咸同之際將帥問之　　，言之悉有所本。且灤通六書之學，不能僅以文人之文目之也·此稿本爲合肥徐子苓（西叔）點定，眉批至多，塗改殆遍，且爲刪去若干篇。巻首有子苓手題云：「尊集和平安雅，具徵學養，其佳者沖夷澹折，愈樸愈妙。僧事去取，惟亮原之！同治癸酉夏，子苓倚裝識。」其所著「暫設皖南巡撫議」一文，後有夏圻手跋。此稿濠叟手寫者亦有數葉。昨復於菊生所，得見濠叟文稿別一本，乃其公子同福（思載）手錄，又多詩集，有趙烈文一序一跋。其詩爲烈文指摘至嚴，且勸刪去若干首。前人服善之心，於斯可見，不第其文章翰墨之足　焉。</p>
<p>叟，名沂孫，字　春。常熟人·淸舉人，鳳陽府知府，有能吏名·年二十，卽好鄧元白書，時蘇人無稱道完白之書者，道光丙午，完白之子守之來常熟，益得見其墨跡，而識篆隸之門徑。及官新安日，得完白書且八十軸，四體俱備·庚申之幾，盡失去。後曾文正輩愛完由書，聲價臼高，至以百金易其書一軸·濠叟嘗稱「完白書當爲本朝第一·」近人無不知寳電完白者，實肇自　叟也·而濠叟小箓之堪以名世，亦泰半得力於完白。</p>
<p>文集有關淸咸同間史料者至多，曾文正與張文毅交惡，言之尤詳，此不備述。</p>
<h3>美國點滴</h3>
<p>— 蒼雨</p>
<p>美國大城市裹汽車擁擠，停車的地方極不易找·銀行家腦筋一轉，增設「汽車開到銀行裏」擺蓄部，客戶提款，均可駛車直入銀行，在儲蓄部的許多辦公室前任擇一個停車處辦理存提手續，客戶可以坐在車子裏不必動身·現在闢有這一類儲蓄處的銀行，全國已達二百五十餘家之多。</p>
<p>美國有一個長人俱樂部的組織，男子身高在六呎二吋以上，女子在五呎十吋以上，方有資格參加。該俱樂部每年舉行大會二次，今年在芝加哥舉行，到男女會員三百人，循例發出通電，要求火車的臥舖床位加長，公共電話箱加高，以維長人利益。並爲六呎一吋半的曼麗。羅倫加冕，推舉她爲「一九四八年的長人皇后」。</p>
<h3>臥讀抄</h3>
<p>— 則仕</p>
<p>近讀英人拉斯基的「美國總統論」，不禁有感於總統之難做，而立向小兒女輩下令日：「此後不許再唱「面孔紅冬冬，將來會做大總統」了。」</p>
<p>原來拉斯基所說的美國總統之難做，其一是事情太繁，就以儀式上的職務而論，就够他筋疲力盡焦頭爛額。例如英國送來一張喬治五世的畫像，他得出席接受典禮·全國教育會議開會，他得應酬一番。華盛頓生臼他得演說一次，林肯忌臼又得嘩啦嘩啦一番。要向童子軍致訓詞，要向外國來的王子王孫表歡迎。要閱兵，要參觀國營大工事。要常常出遊，否則人家要說他把首都華盛頓當作全個合衆國了，而且遊必有方，因要注意政治的反饗。到一處地方要演說一番，如果漏了一處，就得罪當地以及該地出身的議員，免不了找漏洞公報私仇。而且這種種均在筆下不留情的新聞記者衆目睽睽之下舉行，隨隨便便納一言一行，都有成爲舉國談話資料的可能，連太太的舉止也得謹慎小心……</p>
<p>拉君之論十分可信，我還在別種書上見過某總統跟人握手握了一天握得出血的故事。但是儀式上的辛苦總還可對付，弄得美國總統心神憔悴的是政務上的不能獨斷獨行，處處受參衆二院的搗蛋。搗蛋決不是濫用名詞之類·美國政制行政與立法絕對分權，衆議員念念不忘興總統平等，最怕議會成了總統的圓章之譏，故凡總統提案，無不據「情」力爭，至少要打他一個七折八扣，弄得不好就「原壁奉趙」。而法案總要總統創議，儘管爲國爲民，爲世界和平或爲世界戰爭，先得受一番只盡批評調查之責的衆議員磨折。吃力而未必討好，真是美國大總統的生成苦命！</p>
<p>然而美國的歷史雖短，却未嘗「一日無君」，這是人性善－願犧牲一己以福國利民呢？還是人性惡－願拚一死吃河豚呢？是誠值得細思而詳索者也。</p>
<p>###</p>
<p>一般民衆生活之變遷，以雇中之價目爲最便之參考。車夫討價之高低，完全以糧食爲標準，改幣以前，雇三輸（或兩輛），開口「幾十萬」，改幣以後之二十餘日間，則開口「幾七」（卽以三十萬法幣爲單位），而現在稍長一些的路程，開口就是「幾塊」！由此可見其他物價飛騰之速率，又有直綫上升之趨勢了！（例如正陽鬥到後門，改幣以前雇車不過二十幾萬法幣，現在則須一元五至兩元，五六百萬法幣，仍是二斤雜合麫的價錢。）</p>
<p>「限價」開放，各舖照常開門，架上貨物又見　滿，買者以得物爲樂，賣者有生意可做，俱呈活氣。像個市面了。此次改幣失敗，已經翁閣當局公開表示責任，幾度辭職。各大經濟專家對此已有不少名論長言，大概只顧了限制一面，而忘卻整個。釘住都市，釘不住鄉村；釘住正商，釘不住黑市。譬如鋸一支碗，須把全部分籲到，計算用若干鋸子，幾個部位，而後着手。若貿然從一二處着力，則一釘兩釘，全碗更破更　矣。</p>
<p>北平迄未發生像上海那樣大規模的搶買。而「搶賣」之事則時有所見，時有所聞·一種是賣絨衣毛巾綫襪的，每個市塲廟會咸鬧市口上，常有大堆大箱的貨，旁立兩三人，大呼大叫，滿頭是汗（大牛天津口音），高呼這是「關了鬥的貨底子」，「特別賤賣」，「賣完就完」，「買了賣，都謙錢！」因之吸動羣衆，紛紛搶購，但此「搶購」，卻是「搶賣」招來。他們的貨永遠是「貨底子」，（但不知有多少關了門的舖子，　其拋賣！）他們永遠喊着「賣完就完」，然而永遠沒有完。價錢比舖十及常攤略便宜些，然被如此一喊，卻像是賤了許多·又一種是賣香姻的，推着車子或擔着　子，粘些五光十色的標語，說是新出的牌子，爲推銷不惜成太，或買兩盒送一盒，或買一盒送洋火一盒。其所選擇之烟類，有時是新出之品，有時是冷門貨，價康而品質亦不甚惡，常攤雖亦有之，而位在各高級烟之下，不爲人注意，價目亦不一致。此等叫賣商乃善用機會，集共大成，九城百巷，時時遷轉巡行，另備空木箱一個或大藍一隻，專爲主投擲鈔票，但見金圓券，關金券（法幣），五光十色，亂堆亂拋，如聚寶盆一般，使薪酬人員手持月發金劵百數十元的老爺們自慚形穩　。</p>
<p>此外如肥皂，磁鐵等小傢俱，日常需用，都有些小商人隨時叫賣，使市容見得繁熾。</p>

<h3>Rout of Bandit Troops on the Periphery of Xuzhou; Eastern Line Flees in Three Routes; National Army in Pursuit and Annihilation; National Army on Southern Line Ambush Bandits Invading Su County</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Xuzhou by This Newspaper, 16th] The Eastern Advancing National Army, Qiu Qingquan's Corps, has joined forces with Huang Baitao's Corps, which has been firmly defending Nianzhuang, at Bayi Village.</p>
<p>[Urgent Dispatch from Central News Agency, Xuzhou, 16th Morning, 11:00 AM] Xuzhou Pacification Headquarters announces: The bandit troops on the east and west flanks of Xuzhou are now in full retreat, fleeing in disarray. The bandit troops on the southern line are also in complete disarray. Our various armies are now pursuing and attacking with overwhelming force, aiming to annihilate them all.</p>
<p>[Urgent Dispatch from Central News Agency, Xuzhou, 16th Noon, 12:00 PM] Military News: The bandits surrounding Xuzhou have suffered heavy casualties in recent days due to our army and air force's fierce attacks. Since the evening of the 15th, the bandits on the eastern line have begun to collapse and retreat. By 9:00 AM on the 16th, they had completely dispersed and retreated in the directions of Taierzhuang, Yixian, Pixian, Tancheng, and Guanhu Town. Our powerful Huang, Qiu, and Li Corps are in hot pursuit. There have been many bandit casualties and surrenders at Artillery Depot, Xin'anzhen, Gangfangji, Lanshishan, and Huanglongshan. In the vicinity of Nianzhuang alone, over 8,000 bandits have surrendered and laid down their arms to our Huang Corps. Other weapons and materials are piled up like mountains and are currently being inventoried. Since the fierce fighting began on the 8th, the bandits facing the Huang Corps alone have suffered over 93,000 casualties. Currently, large formations of our air force are universally bombing and destroying the bandits' important crossings along the Grand Canal and blockading the bandits' retreat west of the Grand Canal. The bandit vehicles retreating along the railway and highway are also completely destroyed by our bombing. Liu Bocheng's general headquarters of the bandits at Sanbao Station on the Jinpu Line has been completely destroyed by us. Liu himself barely escaped with his life and fled west in disarray. We have captured many important documents, including the bandits' command system chart. It is reported that Liu was ordered by the head bandit Zhu De to command the operations on the east and west lines. With his command post destroyed, the two bandit chiefs, Chen Yi and Chen Geng, lost their command and fled with the defeated troops in panic. Our ground forces are continuing their resolute pursuit. Our air force is distributing leaflets and preferential treatment certificates to persuade the bandit troops to surrender. It is expected that the fleeing bandits will soon be completely disintegrated.</p>
<p>[Dispatch from Central News Agency, Xuzhou, 16th] After 2:00 AM this morning, dense artillery fire was heard northeast and northwest of Xuzhou, ceasing only at 6:00 AM. It is now known that the bandits' Liangguang Column, in order to cover the retreat of the bandits on the east and west flanks, launched a harassing attack on various villages northwest of Jiuli Mountain. After the local troops of Su and Lu, led by Geng Jixun, Zhang Kaiyue, and Hu Li, coordinated with the National Army to launch a fierce attack, and the Xuzhou artillery group brought its power to bear in support, the bandits were defeated and retreated westward at dawn. As for the artillery fire in the northeast, it was the Xuzhou artillery group carrying out a destructive bombardment of the bandits fleeing north of the Bulao River.</p>
<p>[Dispatch from Central News Agency, Xuzhou, 16th] The National Army advancing south from Xuzhou engaged the 28th Regiment of the 9th Division of Liu's Third Column, which was collapsing, in the Yang Shantou, Wu Jia Du, and Nvwa Mountain area, more than 30 li south of Xuzhou, this morning. The bandits left behind over 800 corpses. Taking advantage of the victory, the National Army advanced towards the over 3,000 bandits in Wu Lou and Xinzhuang, south of Sanbao. The National Army advancing north from Jinpu captured Renqiao, south of Su County, today. The Anhui Northern Corps has also approached the outskirts of Su County and made contact with the garrison there. The various armies from the north and south are now coordinating to launch a fierce attack on the bandits near Su County with the National Army who are holding onto Su County. [Another dispatch] Starting at 9:00 PM tonight, artillery fire was again heard south of Xuzhou. According to military sources, Chen Yi's Eighth Column, in order to cover the retreat of the bandit army, launched an attack on Weijia Lake on the outskirts of Xuzhou. Our cavalry units, seeing through their plot, pretended to retreat in order to lure the enemy in deep. After the bandits occupied Weijia Lake, they ventured further north. We waited until they advanced to Jiayuan and then launched a strong counterattack. Friendly forces on both sides also coordinated to launch a pincer attack, annihilating two regiments of bandits. The remaining bandits fled in panic.</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Xuzhou by This Newspaper, 15th] (Arrived) After landing at Lianyungang on the 13th, the elite corps of the National Army entered Donghai County on the 14th and continued to advance westward.</p>
<h3>Deng Wenyi Talks About His Return from Observing the Battle; Rare Battlefield Scene; Dust and Smoke Obscure the Sky Within More Than a Hundred Li</h3>
<p>[Dispatch from Central News Agency, Xuzhou, 16th] Director Deng Wenyi told reporters in Xuzhou today, "In my twenty years in the military, I have never seen such a great and magnificent battlefield scene as the eastern flank of Xuzhou today." Director Deng flew over the eastern flank of Xuzhou this morning with Commander-in-Chief Liu to observe the battle. He said, "I witnessed this time, from Sanbao in Xuzhou in the south to Nianzhuang in the east, all the way south of the Longhai Railway for more than a hundred li, all of which was a battlefield. Flames of war were everywhere, and dust and smoke obscured the sky, almost the last stand before Chen Yi's collapse this morning. The special plane I was in flew relatively high. Looking down at the fighter planes coordinating with the army in combat, their heroic posture of being able to fly up and down freely, and the state of the transport planes airdropping supplies and parachutes being released in unison, were all clearly visible. Only after returning to Xuzhou and getting off the plane did he learn that the bandits in the eastern wing had already collapsed completely, and the bandits seemed to be fleeing in three routes towards the northeast, southwest, and due south." Deng also said: He had visited Guzhen from Bengbu with Commander Liu Ruming yesterday, and he had personally seen the large army advancing north from Jinpu enter Guzhen. He also heard that the Anhui Northern Corps had already entered Mengcheng. Today, he saw the large army advancing south from Xuzhou had already entered Sanbao. Estimating the time and distance, the National Army between Xuzhou and Su County might be able to encircle and annihilate one of the Chen bandit troops that was retreating southwest from the eastern flank.</p>
<p>[Dispatch from United Press, Nanjing, 16th] United Press photographer Hogan inspected the Xuzhou war zone for three hours today on a Chinese Air Force bomber. He discovered that there was no war within fifteen miles of the city center. Traffic in the city was normal, and cars and pedestrians could be seen, but no troops were seen. There were fires in the countryside. The fierce battle was taking place twenty-five miles east of Xuzhou, and the artillery fire was very intense. There was fighting along the railway south of Xuzhou.</p>
<h3>Jinpu and Huainan Lines Both Repaired After Being Damaged</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Mingguang by This Newspaper, 16th] The tracks between Mentai Shi and Changhuai Wei stations on the southern section of the Jinpu Railway were suddenly destroyed by bandits on the night of the 15th. After emergency repairs by the railway bureau, all trains were running as usual at noon on the 16th.</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Hefei by This Newspaper, 15th] The Luoji section north of the Shuijia Lake-Hefei section of the Huainan Railway was destroyed by bandits on the night of the 12th. It was completely repaired by the evening of the 14th, and traffic between Tianjia'an and Hefei resumed today. A bridge near Luqiao in the Shuibeng section was destroyed on the 14th, and traffic between Hefei and Bengbu is still interrupted.</p>

<h3>Legislative Yuan Passes Temporary Motion to Declare the Suppression of Bandits as a War Against Aggression to China and Foreign Countries to Clarify Right and Wrong and Boost Morale</h3>
<p>[Dispatch from Central News Agency, Nanjing, 16th] The Legislative Yuan passed the temporary emergency motion proposed by Committee Member Xu Yuanquan and others on the 16th, requesting the government to determine the nature of the war to suppress the bandits as a war against aggression, and to inform China and foreign countries to clarify right and wrong and boost morale. The text of the motion is as follows: The war to suppress the bandits can be traced back 20 years, and the recent calculation since the victory and recovery and the failure of the Political Consultative Conference has also been two years. In terms of the military strength, public support, and material resources of our government, the suppression of the rebellion should have ended long ago. The reason why it has been protracted and the bandits have grown in strength is due to the government's cherishing of people's lives and many considerations. The Communist bandits do not choose means, and their brutality and terror make it easy to achieve their destructive goals. However, the main reason is that the Communist bandits have always been a part of the international aggressive group and have direct and indirect international support. The weapons of the Japanese army in the Northeast were transferred to the hands of the Communist bandits through aggressive countries, and our country's reception of Lushun and Dalian has been repeatedly rejected, which can be taken as clear evidence. It is not only our country's strength that is facing the world's aggression, but also domestic and foreign people who are blinded by the Communist bandits' skillful propaganda and regard the war to suppress the bandits as a struggle for power. It even reverses right and wrong, regarding the Communist bandits' totalitarian terror as democracy. Not only do countries around the world that love justice and hate aggression stand by and watch, but also the people of the whole country have the idea of surviving and are less united. The key to the success or failure of the war to suppress the bandits should be to unify the views and determine the concepts. In order to make people who love peace, justice, democracy, and freedom in the whole country and the whole world understand that our country's war to suppress the bandits is a war between countries that oppose aggression and aggressive countries, that is, a war between freedom and slavery, a war between peace and terror, and a war between democracy and totalitarianism, and that it is an extension of our war of resistance to win national independence, national survival, and world peace ten years ago, not a struggle for power. It should be requested that the Yuan resolve to ask the government to determine the nature of the war to suppress the bandits as a war against aggression and inform China and foreign countries to boost morale and unify the people's hearts, so that the international community can get more help, accelerate the completion of the suppression of the rebellion, and lay the foundation for world peace. Is it appropriate? Please vote.</p>

<h3>The Great Victory on the Xuzhou Front</h3>
<p>Triumphant news arrives frequently from the Xuzhou front. Our Qiu Qingquan Corps won a victory in the Battle of Huangkou, and our Huang Botao Corps also won a victory in Nianzhuang Bayi Village. These two great victories not only shattered the communist bandits' attempt to invade Xuzhou but also laid a solid foundation for our army's position in Xuzhou. In recent days, our army has continued to expand the fruits of victory. By midnight on the 15th, the communist bandits east of Xuzhou finally collapsed and retreated northeastward in three routes. According to a report from our Air Force Headquarters, the bandit army was making a general retreat towards Xinan Town and Tai'erzhuang. Our reconnaissance aircraft saw hundreds of bandit army trucks retreating north in a disarray, continuously along the way. When this triumphant news reached the capital, all major newspapers published extra editions, and the citizens were preparing to launch a celebration rally. In today's atmosphere of low morale and public distress, we received the triumphant news from Xuzhou. The great achievements of our Qiu and Huang corps on the Xuzhou front are naturally particularly meaningful. This great victory not only stabilized the battle situation on the Xuzhou front but also stabilized the morale of the people in the Jianghuai River basin.</p>
<p>This time, the communist bandits' attack on Xubeng was a joint effort by the communist Chen Yi, Chen Geng, and Liu Bocheng. The forces they gathered exceeded the National Army by more than double. The communist bandits' strategy was still to "use the large to eat the small." The communist bandits east of Xuzhou attempted to encircle our Huang Botao Corps, but after the bloody struggle of the officers and soldiers of our Huang Corps and the rapid reinforcement of the Qiu Corps, the communist bandits' attempt was finally shattered, forcing the communist bandits to flee northeast, forming this unprecedented great victory. From this great victory, we can gain many valuable lessons.</p>
<p>First, since Jinan, Changchun, and Shenyang were abandoned one after another, a small number of defeatists almost lost confidence in the current military situation and mistakenly believed that the overall situation could not be salvaged. In fact, victory and defeat are common in war, and the gains and losses of a city or a place are not of great importance. As long as we can accept the lessons of failure and thoroughly change our strategy, it is not difficult to reverse the situation. Moreover, the victory or defeat of war is a matter of the last moment, and the key lies in morale. As long as the officers and soldiers are not afraid of death, establish strongholds, and fight to the death, they will surely win. The frequent triumphant news from Xuzhou is enough to prove that our military authorities are brave enough to admit mistakes. In the future, the planning of operations should no longer be constrained by politics, and purely focus on military matters. Solving the military difficulties is absolutely not a problem. The great victory in Xuzhou is a strong guarantee.</p>
<p>Second, when we study the reasons for the great victory in Xuzhou, in addition to attributing it to the brave efforts of the generals and soldiers of the Qiu and Huang corps, we must recognize that the participation of our loyal and brave air force was a major factor in this victory. The participation of our air force can not only cooperate with the land forces to inflict heavy damage on the communist bandits, but also use this advantage to "defeat the many with the few." Therefore, in future suppression military operations, we should especially strengthen this advantage. We hope that the United States can focus on this aspect in military aid to China, and the future of the suppression military operations can be greatly optimistic.</p>
<p>Third, there are many reasons for the communist bandits' defeat this time, but the most important one is due to their "underestimation of the enemy." The so-called "arrogant will be defeated" is an inevitable principle in military affairs. The communist bandits, relying on their large forces, were confident that they could capture Xuzhou at will. However, they did not expect that our army would fight one against ten, turning the area east of Xuzhou into the communist bandits' graveyard. This great victory should be able to wake the communist bandits from their dreams! Those who blindly believe in force to create chaos and disregard the life and death of the people will eventually fail. In our country's history, there are countless historical facts that can be used as a warning.</p>
<p>Fourth, the generals and soldiers on the front line calmly fight hard battles and have confidence in the military, which is gratifying. However, the people in the rear are panicking and credulously believing the rumors broadcast by the enemy. But now that they have heard the triumphant news of this great victory, how can they be worthy of the loyal and brave soldiers on the front line! This suppression is the key to the life and death of the nation, and loyalty and treachery cannot coexist. All our patriotic people should stand up and be the backing of the soldiers on the front line, contributing money and effort, comforting the soldiers, inspiring them with greater courage, and striving for the final victory of the Three Principles of the People.</p>

<h3>Republican Leaders Predict the United States Will Strengthen Aid to China, Wheeler Proposes Joint Meeting of Both Houses</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 16th] Republican leaders predicted today that President Truman will lead the way in taking any effective action to step up aid to China. Republican Senator Wheeler has proposed a joint meeting of the Senate and House Foreign Affairs Committees to consider the China issue. This proposal is more popular than the previous proposal by Republican Senator Bridges to convene a special congressional meeting to discuss the China issue. However, according to a Republican senator, any steps to expand aid to China must be initiated by President Truman. This includes ordering a consistent China policy. Congress is currently unaware of the extent of the government's policy. Aid to China has recently been stepped up, but Truman does not publicly state whether the crisis has escalated to the point where further action is needed.

<h3>Beijing Arrests Communist Suspects, Eighty-Two Captured Yesterday Morning, Being Interrogated Separately in Accordance with Martial Law</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 16th] The spokesman of the Capital Garrison Headquarters recently issued the following statement on the arrest of communist suspects in Beijing: Since the communists' full-scale attack on Xuzhou failed repeatedly, the communist plotters lurking in Beijing implemented the communist bandits' usual tactics of opening up a second battlefield in the city to echo their military offensive on the front line in an attempt to reverse the decline. Therefore, they spread news of our military defeats and news unfavorable to our side, creating a climate of terror and endangering public security. The rice-snatching frenzy that occurred a few days ago involved arson and looting of other properties at the same time. It was reported that it was indeed communist spies taking the opportunity to incite an all-out riot. After days of investigation and clues provided by those who surrendered, the lurking locations have been identified. This morning, eighty-two communist suspects were arrested and taken into custody. They are being interrogated separately in accordance with martial law, and their clues are being investigated in order to thoroughly eliminate the lurking communist spies and ensure public security in the rear. Before the conclusion of the investigation of this case, the list of communist suspects will not be made public.</p>
<h3>New Flying Tigers Air Force Says US State Department Did Not Comment</h3>
<p>[United States Information Service, Washington, 15th] A message from Shanghai that General Chennault will lead a new "Flying Tigers" air force in an attempt to save China from the threat of communism was not formally commented on by the State Department today. When asked whether Americans could join the Chinese Air Force or organize a group like the famous "Flying Tigers" during the war, State Department officials said: They had not received any requests from Chennault or other American expatriates in China regarding this issue. But it is generally pointed out that American citizens cannot serve in the military of a foreign country, but the authorities do not issue passports to American citizens serving in foreign armies. Moreover, although American citizens serving in foreign armies do not lose their American citizenship, they will lose the protection of the American government and must surrender their passports. A senior government official also expressed the view that it is also illegal to recruit American citizens in the United States to serve in this type of military service.</p>

<h3>Xu Kan and Relevant Parties Discuss Import and Export Exchange Control Measures, Philippine Overseas Chinese Representatives Arrive in Beijing to Discuss Improving Remittance Issues</h3>
<p>[This newspaper, Nanjing, 16th] Finance Minister Xu Kan is actively discussing with relevant parties the revision of import and export and foreign exchange management measures in accordance with the import and export chain system. Central Bank Vice President Liu Gongyun came to Beijing on the 15th to discuss foreign exchange management measures with Xu Kan. According to qualified sources, the import and export chain system will adopt indirect chain measures, and measures similar to foreign exchange settlement certificates may still be adopted.</p>
<p>[This newspaper, Nanjing, 16th] Lin Wei Bai and Wang Qinghui, representatives of the Overseas Chinese from the Chinese Chamber of Commerce in Manila, Philippines, who were specially dispatched for the remittance issue, arrived in Beijing on the morning of the 16th. In the afternoon of the same day, accompanied by Legislator Lian Mou, they visited Finance Minister Xu Kan and Currency Department Director Wang Fuzhou to discuss improving the overseas Chinese remittance issue. According to Lin et al., in a press conference in the evening, overseas Chinese remittances from Manila alone amount to approximately US$3.5 million to US$4 million per month. After the "August 19" currency system reform, it increased to US$5 million in the first month, but after the depreciation of the Gold Yuan, overseas Chinese remittances have been suspended for a month and a half, with accumulated funds exceeding US$6 million. The current official exchange rate differs greatly from the black market price, and overseas Chinese suffer too much loss if they remit money at the official price. If they engage in black market transactions, the government's losses are also substantial, which is not what the overseas Chinese want. However, for the sake of both public and private interests, this accumulation phenomenon should be quickly addressed. Normally, the total monthly overseas Chinese remittances from the entire Philippines are approximately US$15 million, and the total amount of overseas Chinese remittances from the entire Southeast Asia and other parts of the world is truly staggering. In order to enable the government to grasp this large amount of income and to enable overseas Chinese remittances to effectively support their families in the country, they presented the Finance Minister Xu with the unanimous expectations of the overseas Chinese: (1) The official exchange rate can be adjusted with the market price or paid in the original currency. (2) Simplify foreign exchange settlement procedures and eliminate all unnecessary restrictions. Finance Minister Xu replied that the government will improve the overseas Chinese remittance measures in the short term so that overseas Chinese remittances will not suffer losses and will be made as convenient as possible. Lin et al. expressed their deep gratitude for Xu's straightforward reply. They are scheduled to participate in the National Federation of Industries in Shanghai on the 17th before returning to the Philippines via Xiamen to report to all overseas Chinese.</p>

<h3>Responding to Ivat and Lie's Appeal, Britain, the United States, and France Are of the Same Opinion, Opposing Negotiations Under Coercion; Argentine Foreign Minister Plans to Offer a Compromise Solution to the Berlin Dispute</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Paris, 16th Broadcast: U.S. Secretary of State Marshall, British Deputy Foreign Minister McNeil, and French Foreign Minister Schuman held a meeting this afternoon that lasted until 5:45 PM. Afterwards, a joint communique was issued, stating that the governments of each country had "exactly the same opinion" on the peace proposal put forward by Ivat and Lie.</p>
<p>[United Press, Paris, 16th] The French Cabinet met today, presided over by President Orie. Afterwards, Minister of Information Mitterrand announced that France had endorsed the appeal by UN President Ivat and Secretary-General Lie for direct four-power negotiations. However, France's position on the Soviet blockade of Berlin has not changed. In other words, France will stand with Britain and the United States in firmly opposing negotiations under Soviet coercion, but still hopes that the Berlin negotiations can be resolved through coordination. Foreign Minister Schuman will draft a formal reply to Ivat and Lie's appeal.</p>
<p>[United Press, Paris, 16th] According to sources close to Lie, the key to whether a four-power summit can be realized lies with President Truman. Therefore, this kind of peaceful communication is more earnestly expected from Truman than from the other three heads of state.</p>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Paris, 16th Broadcast: U.S. Ambassador to the Soviet Union Smith flew from Paris to Berlin at 3:00 PM on the 16th. A senior embassy official said that Smith's trip was purely private and not on the orders of Marshall. However, it is said that Smith did visit Marshall on the 15th.</p>
<p>[United Press, Berlin, 16th] On the 16th, the Soviet Union officially spread rumors of a peaceful proposal in Berlin for the first time, showing that the Soviet side is willing to reach an agreement on the Berlin issue. The editorial in the 16th edition of the Soviet military newspaper "Daily Review" attacked Western countries for refusing to support the peace proposal. The editorial stated, "Western countries intend to make the Berlin issue a permanent threat to peace. The agreement will end the dual currency and all restrictions and difficulties in Berlin, including the blockade."</p>
<p>[United Press, Paris, 15th] It is reported that Argentine Foreign Minister Bramuglia, President of the Security Council, has completed a draft of a new solution to the Berlin blockade. Sources in "neutral" countries said that this new solution would require the establishment of a "supervisory" committee to guarantee the implementation of the agreement by both the East and West. Although the Western powers have expressed opposition to direct negotiations with the Kremlin, it is generally expected that the three Western countries will welcome any steps taken in the Security Council to resolve the Berlin issue. Informed sources said that the main points of the Argentine Foreign Minister's solution are two: (1) Action should be completed by both the East and West before December 20 or the agreed-upon date. (2) A Security Council committee should be established to supervise the implementation of this solution.</p>
<h3>UN General Assembly Decides to Expedite Work to Conclude Within One Month</h3>
<p>[U.S. Information Agency, Paris, 15th] The UN General Assembly today approved a plan to expedite the handling of several items on the agenda in order to conclude this session of the General Assembly within one month. This plan proposes that political issues be handled separately by the Political Committee, the Security Council, and the newly established 58-nation ad hoc committee. Under the new arrangement, the Political Committee will deal with the Palestine issue, the relationship between France and Spain, and the treatment of Indians in South Africa. The committee will begin considering the Palestine issue this month.</p>
<p>The newly established ad hoc committee will consider other political issues, including the Security Council's report on the admission of new member states to the United Nations, the Security Council's voting procedures (including the use of the veto), the report of the Interim Committee (also known as the Little General Assembly) advocating the establishment of a permanent body to continue its work during the recess of the General Assembly, studies on ways to promote international political cooperation, and the UN Secretary-General's proposal to establish a United Nations guard force. During the discussion of the organization of the ad hoc committee, Eastern European countries still suggested that the General Assembly should proceed as usual, but believed that the debate on certain issues should be limited, and that evening meetings should also be added. In addition, the discussion of some issues should be postponed until the next session of the General Assembly to speed up the conclusion of this session. Argentine representative Arce also advocated postponing the discussion and suggested that the General Assembly should end on time at midnight on December 8 as originally planned, and reconvene in February or March next year to discuss all outstanding issues. Some small countries also expressed concern, as the establishment of a new committee and the simultaneous discussion of various political issues would overwhelm the delegations with a small number of people. Eastern European countries voted against it in the vote.</p>

According to sources close to the cabinet, the government may seek a vote of confidence from parliament on certain issues related to the handling of the coal miners' strike.</p>
<p>[French News Agency, Paris, 15th] The French coal miners' strike reduced France's coal production in October to 508,000 tons. From January to September of this year, the average monthly production was 4.2 million tons.</p>

<h3>UN Security Council Passes Resolution for a Comprehensive Truce in the Holy Land, Urging Negotiations to Define Permanent Borders</h3>
<p>[French News Agency, Paris, 16th] The United Nations Security Council, by a vote of eight to one against Syria, with the Soviet Union and Ukraine abstaining, passed a resolution proposed by France, Canada, and Belgium for a comprehensive truce in Palestine. The resolution calls on both the Arab and Jewish sides to conclude a comprehensive truce agreement and to hold direct truce negotiations through the mediation of mediator Bunch. The resolution also stipulates that this truce agreement will define permanent lines that the two belligerent countries cannot cross. It also stipulates all troop withdrawal measures or mutual reduction of troop strength in order to reach a temporary truce period, and then to achieve lasting peace in Palestine.</p>
<p>Before the vote, Israeli representative Eban spoke first, stating that his government supports the Franco-Belgian-Canadian proposal of the 15th concerning the early conclusion of a truce agreement in Palestine and the immediate commencement of negotiations between the two sides. Eban attacked the possible imposition of sanctions if any party in the conflict does not comply with the proposal passed by the Security Council on the 4th of this month and refuses to comply with the order to withdraw troops. Eban said that Israel will not withdraw its troops, because no country can agree to withdraw its troops from two-thirds of its territory. Syrian representative Curry said that the Arab countries are not prepared to comply with the proposal, because negotiating with the Jews is tantamount to recognizing Jewish sovereignty, which the Arab countries will never do. In addition, the Arab countries are unwilling to engage in any special negotiations until the situation in Palestine has been clarified. He also said that although the Jews have gained the upper hand in the initial clashes, it is not yet known who will win the second round of clashes, and the Arab countries are prepared to continue fighting. Representatives from Egypt and Lebanon also made similar speeches.</p>
<p>[United Press, Paris, 16th] The United Nations Security Council today discussed the Palestinian truce plan proposed by Canada. Chinese representative Xu Shuxi expressed his support, but pointed out that this plan seems to focus on facilitating initial peace rather than a comprehensive cessation of fighting. At the same time, the UN General Assembly Political Committee met to discuss the mediation plan of former Palestine mediator Bernadotte. Arab representatives launched a major attack on Bei.</p>
<h3>Opinions on the Ruhr Area Issue Still Differ Among Countries</h3>
<p>[French News Agency, London, 15th] The six-nation Ruhr Conference met for three and a half hours today. The divergence of opinions among the countries has become increasingly apparent. According to British officials, the countries have not fully agreed on the future Ruhr control agency and the distribution plan for Ruhr coal, iron, and steel production. However, the specific bottleneck has not been revealed. It is also learned that the sovereignty issue of the Ruhr mining area raised by French representative Alphant at the meeting last Thursday is currently being brokered diplomatically, so this issue may not be raised to the meeting again. However, the French side said that the issue of international control of the Ruhr mining area and Ruhr industry raised by Alphant will still be discussed at the Ruhr Conference after the British and American sides have expressed their positions.</p>

<p>Siamese Prime Minister Has Doubled His Guard</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Bangkok, 16th] The long-tailed comet discovered by the Nanjing Observatory yesterday morning has also been seen by some early risers here in the past seven days. When the sky is clear, the star is very clear, and its long tail can be seen without a telescope. According to astronomers, the light of a comet's tail is diffuse, but the tail of the comet recently described here has a straight shape. The appearance of this comet has caused a great stir in Siamese political circles. Astrologers have considerable influence on political figures, and they deeply value this comet as a sign of misfortune. It is reported that Phibun, the Siamese Prime Minister, who deeply believes in astrology, has doubled his guard to protect his own safety.</p>
<h3>Japanese National Civil Servants Hold Demonstrations</h3>
<p>Government Has Decided to Strictly Prohibit Them</p>
<p>[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 16th] The All-Japan Confederation of Public Service Employees' Unions is scheduled to hold a demonstration march in Tokyo on the 16th, demanding that the civil service law not be amended and that special treatment be improved. The government authorities strictly prohibit members from participating. Chief Cabinet Secretary Sato issued a statement on the 15th, saying, "If officials at all levels participate in the demonstration on the 16th for the sake of special treatment issues, the government believes that it will hinder the operation of national affairs, and will strictly prohibit it. Each ministry and department should investigate the number of people participating and give them salary reductions and other punishments."</p>
<h3>Yoshida to Announce Dissolution of Diet, Attempting to Restore Imperial Authority; Allied Headquarters Believe Current Cabinet Has No Right to Dissolve Diet</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Tokyo, 16th] Ignoring the well-known wishes of the Allied Headquarters, Japanese Prime Minister Yoshida announced to the Diet on the 16th that after the Diet passes the Labor Standards Law Amendment Bill, he will dissolve the Diet and hold a general election again. Officials at the Allied Headquarters believe that Yoshida's move is a clear attempt to undermine the constitution and restore the political power of the Emperor, but they are not yet willing to engage in constitutional debate on the issue of Diet dissolution. They hope that the Japanese people can solve their own problems within the possible range, without the need for Allied intervention.</p>
<h3>Japanese Diet in Chaos</h3>
<p>Yoshida Refuses to Deliver Policy Speech, Leaves After Brief Address</p>
<p>[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 16th] At the plenary session of the House of Representatives on the afternoon of the 15th, the opposition parties' request that Yoshida deliver a policy speech first was passed. Yoshida said in the House, "The current cabinet is a minority party cabinet formed by more than two hundred blank votes. It is common political sense that this temporary Diet will be dissolved once it meets. However, the purpose of convening this temporary Diet is to deliberate on two or three emergency bills such as the National Public Service Law, which cannot be avoided. Therefore, other bills should not be submitted, and it is natural to dissolve it after the passage of these bills. Although the opposition parties do not intend to force a shortening of the deliberation time, if the deliberation is delayed, it will not only cause obstacles in the operation of national affairs, but also damage Japan's prestige in the world." After speaking, he left the meeting, and the other cabinet members also left the meeting one after another. As a result, the scene was filled with voices of government insincerity, and it fell into chaos. Socialist Party Secretary-General Asanuma reached an agreement requesting Yoshida to return to the House of Representatives. Speaker Matsuoka gently advised him, and then discussed an emergency motion to adjourn the meeting. As a result of the vote, the meeting, which was full of farcical situations, was adjourned at 7:15.</p>
<h3>Execution Date of Tojo and Others Approaching; Precautions Taken in Various Parts of Japan</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Tokyo, 16th] According to reports on the 16th, the Tokyo area and other parts of Japan will be under extraordinary alert by the Japanese police, as authorities fear disturbances may occur after the execution dates of Tojo and other war criminals sentenced to death are announced.</p>
<p>[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 16th] Mr. Cabanata, Director of the Legal Affairs Bureau of MacArthur Headquarters, announced that the defense lawyers of Japanese war criminals can visit the war criminals individually at Sugamo Prison from today until the 19th, so that the defense lawyers can handle the formalities for requesting commutation on behalf of the defendants.</p>
<h3>Corfu Strait Incident</h3>
<p>Albania's Defense</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, The Hague, 15th] The Albanian representative argued in the International Court of Justice regarding the British accusation that Albanian batteries in the Corfu Strait damaged a British destroyer, that the Albanian batteries only had four medium-sized cannons, and it was impossible for two modern British destroyers not to have received a warning from the Albanian batteries to retreat. Alan's lawyer also said that the British destroyers' navigation route did not retreat to the middle of the strait, which had already been cleared of mines.</p>

<p>[United Press International, Tokyo, 16th] 20,000 workers at the Yawata Steel Works in Japan joined the strike wave of coal miners, metal miners, and electrical workers today, demanding wage increases. The situation is particularly serious in coal mines, with tens of thousands of miners from Hokkaido to Kyushu continuing their strike for 24 hours. Coal production has gradually been affected, and the actual number of strikers is difficult to determine. According to today's reports, 34,000 miners in Kyushu are on strike, and at least 57,000 miners in Hokkaido are participating. Carpenters in various mines have also responded, adopting a new tactic of not bringing tools to work at all.</p>

<p>Over 4,000 Congratulatory Telegrams Received</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, London, 15th] Sir Gilliat, the British royal obstetrician, did not issue a statement after visiting the new mother, Princess Elizabeth, today.

<h3>Dissection of Germany</h3>
<p>— Translated by the Editorial Department of This Newspaper</p>
<p>— Translated from the September issue of "The Atlantic Monthly" —</p>
<p>Germany, which three years ago was regarded as a laboratory problem for re-education and control, with its four victorious powers solving it by mutual agreement, has today become the decisive battleground between East and West. If the Western powers can control Berlin, they have the opportunity to restore the industry of West Germany, enable the European Recovery Program to succeed, attract Eastern countries from the Soviet sphere of influence, and finally unite Europe under Western conditions.</p>
<p>In July 1945, the victorious powers of Germany divided it into five parts: four occupation zones and the city of Berlin. They agreed that these five regions should be governed according to common economic and political principles. Now, to meet practical needs, Germany has been divided into three parts: East, West, and the city of Berlin. There is hardly any precedent for such a situation where three parts of the same country are so different.</p>
<p>The Desolate and Barren Soviet Occupation Zone</p>
<p>The Soviet occupation zone, which a famous German newspaper called the "Quiet Zone," is a wasteland, dotted with desolate farms, dilapidated factories, inhabited by 17 million haggard and despairing German residents, and at least 300,000 Soviet soldiers and officials.</p>
<p>The flat grain fields of Mecklenburg, the rolling green hills of Thuringia, the sandy land and pine forests of Brandenburg, the textile and machine industries of Saxony, and the brown coal mines, metallurgical plants, and chemical plants of Saxony-Anhalt, all of this is practically equivalent to a colony annexed by the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>The Soviet occupation zone was originally a rich agricultural area, providing 3,700 calories of heat per person per day. Now, its residents are rationed an average of 1,400 calories per day. The reasons for this difference between past and present are as follows: war losses, lack of fertilizer or transportation to the Soviet Union, the Soviet-style land reform that divided good farms into small, inefficient units, and the Soviet Union's forced requisition of grains, sugar, and livestock. This spring, in order to prevent a real famine, the Soviet Union had to transport back 20,000 tons of the hundreds of thousands of tons of grains they had already transported out.</p>
<p>The famous factories in the Soviet occupation zone only have empty factory buildings left. The broken floors and curved rafters prove the Soviet Union's rough behavior when dismantling the machines. Fifty percent of the industrial capacity of the occupation zone was washed eastward in the summer of 1945; it is feared that only five percent of it was still usable when it reached the Soviet Union. Since then, the dismantling work has not been as careless as before, and at the same time, the Soviet authorities have moved 30,000 German technicians and their families to the Soviet Union along with the factories. Part of the Meissen porcelain factory now ships goods in Tbilisi, and Zeiss lenses and cameras are now manufactured near Moscow and Leningrad.</p>
<p>Thirty percent of Germany's remaining industry is Soviet state-owned factories, all producing for the Soviet Union. The rest, whether bought out and become German public property, or held by a few private individuals, must send 80 to 90 percent of their products to the East.</p>
<p>Difficult to Survive, Impossible to Die</p>
<p>Germany's dilapidated industrial production is decreasing day by day, while the Soviet Union's exploitation remains the same. This area could be more beneficial to the Soviet Union if it were managed properly. The only way to explain why the Soviet Union wants to destroy it is with the Soviet Union's childish incompetence and suspicion.</p>
<p>The Germans living in this area are all miserable, weak, and pitiful worms, truly "difficult to survive, impossible to die." The ubiquitous Soviet secret police and the well-organized German Communist Party agents follow you everywhere, paying attention to your every word. Hundreds of thousands of people have been denounced as "capitalist special agents," "reactionaries," or "Anglo-American spies" for not filling in their words, and all have been sent to Soviet concentration camps, which are located on the original sites of the famous Nazi concentration camps. 200,000 men and women have been sent to the Soviet Union to do hard labor, and another 25,000 have been sent to the uranium mines in southern Saxony to mine ore for atomic bomb experiments for the mining union.</p>
<p>The brown Nazi dictatorship has been replaced by the red Soviet dictatorship. Communist propaganda boasts of a national chauvinism as fanatical as Goebbels, using more or less the same wording. A few weeks ago, it was revealed that the vehement anti-American articles published in the German newspaper Taegliche Rundschau printed by the Soviets were completely copied from a Nazi pamphlet published in 1942. The average German is not surprised by this.</p>
<p>Since Soviet communism's nationalism cannot win the trust of the German people, it has specially created a party for former Nazis to make their emotions tend towards the Soviet Union. But the basic feeling of the Germans in the Soviet occupation zone is only hatred for the Soviet Union, expressed in a strong and powerless German nationalism, and a deep hatred for everything from the East.</p>
<p>West Germany is Reviving</p>
<p>The land across the Iron Curtain to the east is dying and lifeless. The Germany to the west of the Iron Curtain is reviving, although not in a balanced way, but in a down-to-earth way. After the recent currency reform, store windows were suddenly filled with hoardings that had come out of hiding. American cigarettes, which were regarded as a barometer of the black market, fell from West Marks to 40 Pfennig, almost equal to the legal price. Regular monthly imports of 300,000 tons of Anglo-American food and more than $1 billion in Marshall Plan aid are sufficient to further improve the lives of the West German people.</p>
<p>The basic food ration is not sufficient, but the large amount of black market food sold by farms preserves the health of the general public and makes the farmers wealthy. In the past, the rampant and indispensable black market made it impossible for countless Germans to survive. Now the situation is different, because after the currency reform, the amount of currency has decreased, and they seem to be relieved. The new currency, called the Deutsche Mark, has gained the trust of the public, giving them hope for economic stability.</p>
<p>If the cruelty of the Soviet Union has caused intense hatred, then the amazing generosity of the West has been met with nitpicking criticism. The German appetite is a bottomless pit; the food supplied by the British and Americans is never enough, and the styles cannot satisfy him. In addition, "no matter what, it always comes from Germany." Regardless of the $1 billion in U.S. aid, rumors are still circulating that German industrial competition will be eliminated.</p>
<p>General Clay, commander of the U.S. forces in the general territory, painstakingly fought for this aid for Germany, but was seen as "anti-German," while his enthusiastic subordinates were denounced as "a group of Jewish refugees."</p>
<p>The Ruhr Area, the Industrial Heart</p>
<p>The voices of opposition from the right and left to the international co-management of the Ruhr area, which was agreed upon in London, are growing louder. Miners have become the target of agitation, and they hear appeals that if Germany cannot fully control its coal and steel, or Moscow cannot share a piece, then it is better not to produce. In response to this propaganda, plans to supply food to encourage miners have increased coal production (but not high enough for a real recovery) and reduced the power of the Communist Party (but not low enough for real security). Steel production is about one-third of the ten million tons allowed to be produced in Germany.</p>
<p>After the terrible bombing, factories and mines in the Ruhr area need capital and equipment, and workers need housing. In addition to material recovery, the Ruhr area also needs spiritual tranquility. Steel mills and coal mines have been bought out by the British, so neither labor nor capital has a real incentive to increase production. The socialization of the Ruhr area's industry has a long way to go to achieve the goals of curbing communism, weakening the German nationalist faction, and training workers who are either indifferent or disruptive into responsible citizens.</p>
<p>Apart from the Ruhr area, Bavaria is permeated with Catholic power and resents northern Germany. Hanseatic wistfully regrets that its shipping industry was taken away by Bremen. Schleswig-Holstein sighs at the two million refugees it has to support. The French occupation zone practices self-reliance under the careful planning of the French military government. Undoubtedly, the West German people are unwilling to organize a government that the Western powers allow them to organize, mostly due to this psychological independence. "Unification of Germany" is certainly a powerful slogan, but the inconceivable selfishness is also a strong fact.</p>
<p>The Social Democratic Party of Berlin</p>
<p>Is there any sign that Germany is becoming a democratic country? As in the time of the German Emperor or the Weimar Republic, the German Social Democratic Party constitutes the only strong democratic force in the country.</p>
<p>When the general election was held in October 1946, the Soviet Union deliberately eliminated the Social Democratic Party in its stronghold, which won nearly half of the votes. Since then, the party's strength has gradually increased. The party has repeatedly opposed the Communist Party's terrorist acts with strong and public protests, and has made Berliners raise their heads by advocating free thought. Many Social Democratic Party officials have been kidnapped by the Soviet side, beaten by German Communist Party thugs, and intimidated or dismissed by both sides. The party has never compromised, and neither has the city of Berlin.</p>
<p>The German Socialist Party is certainly not acting alone. Their Western adversaries, the Christian Democratic Party and the Free Democratic Party, are united in the anti-communist front in the city government. The party has shown extreme calm and unyielding attitude under the Soviet blockade policy, and has similarly gained the trust of the Berlin people.</p>
<p>Life in Berlin has a frontier style. It also has its dark side - the corruption of the black market, terrible crimes, and speculation. But it also has its bright side - extensive social activities, deep friendships, mutual assistance between comrades, provocative environment, tense and complex work, rapid pace, and a spirit of concerted effort. Berlin life has no age or nationality distinction, only the boundary between East and West. In the eyes of Berliners, Berlin is still Berlin. In appearance, it is a dead city, but in spirit, it is alive and well. Today's Berlin is the political key to controlling Europe, just as West Germany is the economic key to controlling Europe.</p>
<h3>City Middle School Teachers and Staff Take Collective Leave Yesterday; Resume Teaching This Morning After Mayor's Persuasion; City Government to Discuss Welfare Issues at a Meeting This Afternoon</h3>
<p>[Our Report] Due to difficult living conditions, the Municipal Middle School Teachers and Staff Association previously submitted an urgent relief request to the city government. Although Speaker Pan, Education Bureau Director Li, and various municipal middle school principals actively intervened and persuaded, no results were achieved. Consequently, 1,200 teachers and staff from 31 municipal middle schools decided at a joint meeting of directors, supervisors, and school representatives the night before last to take collective leave for one week starting yesterday and issued an open letter to the public and parents of students. At 3 PM, another meeting of directors and supervisors was held at Gezhi Middle School, where Mayor Wu, Director Li, and municipal middle school principals went to persuade them. The meeting continued until after 8 PM, when it was decided to accept the Mayor's persuasion and resume teaching this morning. However, in reality, some staff had already returned to their hometowns or were not notified in time, so formal resumption of classes would only be possible in the afternoon or tomorrow. Mayor Wu also scheduled a meeting at the city government at 3 PM today to discuss teacher and staff welfare issues.</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon at 6 PM, Mayor Wu addressed the joint meeting of directors and supervisors of the Middle School Teachers and Staff Association, stating that everyone knows the hardship of public school teachers and staff. While the cost of living index for workers is 8.1 times higher, it is only 2.5 times higher for public school teachers and staff. He sympathizes with this, so he distributed three dou of rice after consulting with the Food Department and will issue it as soon as possible. Due to the city's financial constraints, the supplementary one and a half months' salary was advanced by borrowing 3 million yuan from the Central Bank. He has done his best in this regard. In this difficult period, he hopes for mutual understanding, cooperation, and the elimination of ill will to overcome difficulties together. He promised to immediately investigate and issue the salaries of newly hired teachers in various schools and the advanced study fees for teachers in normal elementary schools. Regarding the allocation of wool fabric, he has asked Director Li to contact the China Textile Corporation. The Legislative Yuan is already discussing the overall plan to improve the treatment of public school teachers and staff, and a decision is expected soon. However, the request for emergency relief of one dan of rice, two bags of flour, and 500 gold yuan is practically impossible to fulfill. The city government has now decided to allocate the sealed materials in a coordinated manner to all public school teachers and staff in the city and has scheduled a meeting at the city government at 3 PM on the 17th (today) to discuss it. He is responsible for ensuring that there is no concealment and that the distribution is fair. Staff representatives and principals can participate in the meeting to ensure credibility.</p>
<h3>City Elementary School Teacher Representatives Appeal to Two Leaders for Relief</h3>
<p>[Our Report] Yesterday morning, representatives of city elementary school teachers and staff visited Speaker Pan and Director Wu of the Social Affairs Bureau to report on their difficult living conditions and request assistance and relief. Director Wu stated that the municipal authorities are trying to find a way to allocate the sealed materials in the city in a coordinated manner to all public school teachers and staff. The Mayor has decided to allocate one pound of woolen yarn to each person at a price of 10 yuan, which will be distributed soon. Other relief materials will be discussed and distributed later.</p>
<p>Furthermore, city elementary school principals and teachers and staff are scheduled to hold a joint meeting at 3 PM today to discuss issues such as requesting emergency relief and requesting the central government to adjust the treatment of public school teachers and staff.</p>
<h3>Private School Representatives Visit the Mayor to Discuss Collecting Teacher Subsidy Fees</h3>
<p>Yesterday morning, Acting Director Li of the Education Bureau, accompanied by representatives of private primary and secondary schools Jiang Jizhou, Ji Hao, Shi Jiadong, and others, paid a visit to Mayor Wu to discuss the collection of teacher living subsidy fees by private schools. Mayor Wu expressed great sympathy for the difficult living conditions of teachers in private schools, but hoped that the schools would do their best to reduce the fee amount to ease the burden on parents and instructed Acting Director Li to carefully discuss solutions. According to Jiang Jizhou, chairman of the Private Primary and Secondary School Federation, private schools intend to collect fees again to stabilize the lives of teachers and staff, which is truly unavoidable. At a time when the social economy is depleted, there must be a considerable number of students' parents who cannot afford this tuition. All schools are willing to expand the number of tuition reductions and exemptions as much as possible to prevent any student from dropping out of school due to inability to pay.</p>
<h3>Airfares to Increase Again by Twofold Starting Tomorrow</h3>
<p>[Our Report] Airfares will be adjusted again starting tomorrow (new prices will apply to purchases made today). Calculated by flight mileage, the price will increase from 0.66 yuan per kilometer to 2.2 yuan, an increase of about twofold compared to the price that took effect on the 9th of this month. The Shanghai-Beijing line will still be charged at 80% of the fare, and the Beijing-Shanghai line will still be offered at a 50% discount. The current fare adjustment is only one week away from the most recent price increase, which is due to the change in the exchange rate between the gold yuan and the US dollar and the soaring price of gasoline, which has affected shipping costs.

<h3>Demanding Reconciliation; Prostitutes Gather Crowd to Commit Assault</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Report] Hongbao, formerly a prostitute in the Yunshang Brothel, was later transferred to the Jincheng Brothel and renamed Shanshan. In the 34th year of the Republic of China, she had an affair with Zhang Hongchun, who opened the Xingji Sauce Garden at No. 201 Dantu Road, and cohabited at No. 10 Sailong Lane, East Yuhang Road. Later, because of the woman's misconduct, Zhang was dissatisfied and broke off the relationship in June last summer. The woman then became a private prostitute, often entering and leaving small hotels. Recently, due to the rising cost of living, she was unable to support herself due to poverty. The day before yesterday, she returned to Zhang's place to demand a reconciliation. After Zhang sternly refused, she left unhappily. Unexpectedly, at 4:00 PM yesterday, the woman gathered more than 20 thugs, including four holding pistols, to Zhang's place to extort 20,000 Gold Yuan. When they failed, they beat and insulted Zhang and injured his head with the butt of a gun, causing continuous bleeding. After someone reported to the Flying Fortress, the thugs dispersed in a hubbub. Only Hongbao was arrested and taken to the Tilanqiao Police Branch for punishment according to the law.</p>

<h3>Resolution of the Customs Strike; Employees Receive Half-Month's Salary as Loan</h3>
<p>Regarding the strike of Jianghai Customs employees, the Municipal Government and the Garrison Department sent Wang Zhaoquan and He Longqing to persuade them at 10:00 AM yesterday. Afterwards, Customs Commissioner Zhang Yongnian repeatedly summoned the heads of various departments to do their best to疏导. According to the employees' opinion, the two斗of rice, one bag of flour, and two斤of cooking oil that the authorities planned to issue were of no help. They requested a loan of some cash to supplement their daily expenses. After Zhang consulted the authorities, the result was that another half-month's new salary was allocated to help with the urgent needs. The employees agreed and decided to resume work uniformly starting today. However, the employees still hope that the authorities will request the Ministry of Finance to adjust their treatment to be equal to that of the four banks as a goal. It is reported that the main work such as closing customs and inspecting ships was still carried out as usual during the strike period, and the backlog of cases will be handled as soon as possible after the resumption of work.</p>

<h3>Mint Opens to Cast Gold Bars; Deposits Exchanged for Gold and Silver to Be Implemented Soon</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Report] Director Wei of the Central Mint, who went to Nanjing earlier to ask Finance Minister Xu for instructions on the mint's future policy, returned to Shanghai on the 15th. He told reporters that the mint started casting gold bars today (16th). The weights are divided into three types: five qian, one liang, and ten liang. The current output is 2,000 large and small bars per day. From next month, it can be increased to 5,000 to 10,000 bars. As for the opening of casting gold and silver coins, it is still in the planning stage. The original one-fen steel coins and five-jiao silver coins have been ordered to stop casting.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Report] It is reported that the detailed rules for the implementation of deposit exchange for gold and silver have been carefully discussed by the heads of various bureaus and departments of the Central Bank and were finally approved on the 15th. Yesterday, Vice President Liu of the bank took it to Nanjing for approval. If approved, it is expected to be implemented starting from the 22nd. It is heard that the gold allocated for deposit exchange this time is made from gold bricks purchased by the Central Bank from the United States, not from the gold exchanged from the people. The batch of gold bricks has been allocated to the Central Mint in batches by the Central Bank to melt into gold bars, divided into three types: five qian, one liang, and ten liang, with a fineness of one thousandths. After the exchange rules are approved, it is expected to start exchanging at the same time in 25 cities including Beijing, Shanghai, Hangzhou, Hankou, Ping, Tianjin, Guangzhou, Fuzhou, Yunnan, and Guiyang starting from the 22nd. In Shanghai, in addition to the National Bank, the Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, and the Agricultural Bank of China will be commissioned to exchange at the same time. In other cities, the Central Bank will temporarily exchange exclusively. In the future, the exchange agencies will be added as needed.</p>
<h3>Money Market First Loose, Then Tight</h3>
<p>Central Bank Issues 20 Yuan Notes</p>
<p>The trend of money market funds became looser yesterday. Supply from various industries turned prosperous, and turnover was unusually flexible. The market's implicit interest rate also fell, around 25 to 40 yuan per thousand yuan per day, equivalent to a monthly interest rate of 7.5 fen to 1.2 yuan. The industry's firms have resumed lending, which has a particularly large impact on the market. Until near noon, it turned tight again, rising by 5%.</p>
<p>[Another Report] The firm trend of cash has gradually declined due to the Central Bank's supply of large quantities of 50 yuan to 100 yuan notes in recent days. The Central Bank also issued a 20 yuan note yesterday. The note is green and was printed by the American Banknote Company in 1945. The front has the late Chairman Lin's photo. Yesterday's surface discount fell to 50 yuan per thousand yuan.</p>
<h3>Private Trade with Japan; Barter Trade Has Export Surplus</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Report] According to the Export Control Commission, after the opening of private trade with Japan, the government has been extremely cautious in management. At present, cash transactions are limited to exports, and applications for cash imports are generally prohibited. Other transactions are handled by barter. As of now, the value of goods exported by barter trade has reached US$663,919.97, while the value of goods imported is only US$74,670.87. Compared, there is an export surplus of US$589,249.1. The exported goods are mostly agricultural products, with wheat bran and castor bean cake being the main items. The only imported item is rayon. A table of the quantities and values of various imported and exported goods is listed below. Imported goods: Rayon 470 boxes, US$74,670.87.

<h3>Silk Soars</h3>
<p>The rayon market yesterday was first high and then soft. People were optimistic, and the floating parties tried their best to push it up. Local gangs also started to add to the buying, and the asking price went straight up. Later, because the account holders sold at high prices, the customer gangs' willingness to accept turned weak, and the actual sales were not good. The trend was high and then soft, and the closing price saw an upward trend. The opening price of No. 120 Tianqiao was 12,000 and 13,000 yuan, and the incoming households were watching. Although the area tried its best to pull it up, in the end, the footing was weak and the people's hearts were not firm. The market price instantly returned to the 10,000 yuan mark and ended. The ups and downs of the remaining righteous goods also followed closely, and the results saw a slight natural rise. In the afternoon, the asking price outside the market saw another peak, and the market's heart was suddenly silent. Various objects outside the industry also tended to be firm, but there were not many transactions after the asking price.</p>
<p>The raw silk market followed the ups and downs of rayon, and the trend was first high and then soft, and the closing price returned to low again. The local silk weaving industry's acceptance of superior grade retail was not weak. The initial opening trend was sharp. After the price rose, the account holders sold one after another. With more supply than demand, all parties watched again. The asking price went step by step downstream, and the market price fell to the previous day's closing price. The account holders did not sell, and the result was a slight increase of several hundred yuan. At first, silk and satin rose due to the soaring prices of raw materials, and everyone was optimistic. The asking price was either not raised or high. The initial opening price of duvet cover was 7,500 and 8,000 yuan. After the high price, the factory sold it continuously, and the customer gangs' acceptance was light. The industry dumped it, and the market conditions softened. Later, because the money market was loose, the local acceptance reopened, and the closing price rose again. In the afternoon, due to rumors, the people's hearts turned silent, and the asking price was chaotic.</p>
<h3>Yarn Prices Stop Rising and Turn Down; Cotton Cloth Trend Also Sees a Decline</h3>
<p>Yesterday's yarn and cloth outside the market, because the finished product sales of the replication manufacturers were not smooth, and it was heard that the Central Bank was tightening the money market very severely, all parties' funds were still tight, and there was continued sales secretly, so the asking price stopped rising and turned down.</p>
<p>42-count Blue Phoenix fine yarn, because the previous day's surge was too large, retail investors sold it, and finally returned to 8,900 yuan to end, a drop of 1,400 yuan from the previous day. Those for delivery tomorrow were at 10,300 yuan.</p>
<p>40-count Jincheng 9,000 yuan, 32-count Silver Moon 8,400 yuan, 21-count Double Horse yarn yarn merchants sold to each other, replication manufacturers watched, the asking price stepped down to 7,500 yuan, still lacking buyers, a drop of 300 yuan from the previous day. Other counts of coarse and fine yarn also fell, and the market trend was quite tired.</p>
<p>Yesterday's cotton cloth, the initial asking price outside the market followed the sharp trend of the previous day, and someone wanted to buy the leading fine cloth for 365 yuan. Later, it was heard that the government would exchange as much gold as possible, so that a large number of Gold Yuan certificates would return to the market, and the market's funds were still tight. Most of the holders were pessimistic, and the customer gangs' destocking was also sluggish. Moreover, it was time for spinning to be allocated, so the asking price was unable to hold on.</p>
<p>The leading fine cloth stepped down from 365 yuan to 310 yuan at the close, a drop of 55 yuan from the previous day. Four Gentlemen drills were also sold at a slight price of 315 yuan. 190 high-grade Shilin cloth was offered at 600 yuan, but buyers were lacking and the market atmosphere was sluggish.</p>
<h3>Rice Price Increase; Flour, Oil, and Other Grains All Rebound</h3>
<p>After a sharp decline in rice prices in this city over the past few days, the market rebounded by 10% yesterday. This was because underground interest rates in the market had retreated to the 100 yuan mark. Yesterday, 50-60 yuan could buy a large amount of rice. It was also rumored that itinerant sellers were continuously arriving in Shanghai. With most companies having paid out salaries and wages, general purchasing power has increased, and various parties are actively replenishing their rice stocks while prices are low.</p>
<p>The market opening yesterday was relatively calm. After 10 o'clock, many rice dealers began bidding aggressively, and prices soared. In the northern market, *bai geng* rice was at 470 yuan, and *bao dao* rice was at 480 yuan. In the southern market, *bai geng* rice was at 450 yuan, and *bao dao* rice was the same price as in the northern market. Early rice was at 450 yuan, and *du xian* rice was at 390 yuan. Total arrivals in both markets were 2,875 *shi* and 2.25 *dou*.</p>
<p>Many customers in the flour market were actively buying, and dealers were holding firm. Factories were not offering much supply, and the market rose by about 30 yuan. Old car flour was at 160 yuan, naval vessel flour was at 150 yuan, and Fuxin bran was at 107 yuan.</p>
<p>Cooking oil also rose with rice flour. Soybean oil was at 900 yuan. Only Jiangbei pure raw oil was available, at 1,300 yuan. Small cart sesame oil was at 900 yuan, and soybean cake was at 80 yuan. Transactions were also more active than yesterday.</p>
<h3>Canton-Hankow Railway's Eight Lines: Virgin Mining Territory</h3>
<p>— Our Reporter Mao Shukui</p>
<p>[Our Report] Among the national railways currently, apart from the Shanghai-Nanjing and Shanghai-Hangzhou railways, the Canton-Hankow Railway is the only one that can be self-sufficient. In this turbulent era, this major artery connecting Central and Southern China is of utmost military importance, and its economic value is even more worthy of our attention. In October 1938, Guangzhou and Hankou fell successively. At that time, President Chiang Kai-shek personally instructed Du Zhenyuan, Director of the Canton-Hankow Railway Bureau, to thoroughly destroy the railway to the point where the enemy could not repair and use it within six months. This order paralyzed the Canton-Hankow Railway for a full decade. In December 1946, President Chiang summoned Director Du to Nanjing again, ordering him to repair the entire line within six months. On July 1, 1947, the employees of the Canton-Hankow Railway completed the engineering work that the enemy had been unable to complete in ten years, painstakingly connecting 1,300 kilometers of steel rails. Although the US aid funds had been reduced from 4,200 gold yuan to 500 gold yuan, and this meager 500 gold yuan was still in the planning stages, the Canton-Hankow Railway had already become self-reliant at this time, improving and rebuilding step by step, and embarking on the road to recovery. Before June of this year, more than 500 temporary bridges had been replaced with steel bridges. All of this is thanks to the employees of the Canton-Hankow Railway, but it also illustrates the value of the Canton-Hankow Railway itself.</p>
<p>The Canton-Hankow Railway passes through many mineral-rich areas, such as iron in Leiyang, Youxian, Ningxiang in Hunan Province, and Daye in Hubei Province; antimony in Yizhang, Xinhua, and Yiyang; lead and zinc in Chenxian, Linwu, and Changning, and coal mines scattered throughout the provinces. The Canton-Hankow Railway authorities are well aware that their future prospects depend entirely on the development of these many natural resources. The Railway Bureau is now fully assisting in the development of various coal mines, building railway branch lines directly to the mining areas to facilitate transportation. More than 150 kilometers of branch lines have been approved by the Ministry of Communications or are under construction, totaling eight lines: (1) Baiyang Branch Line: from Baishidu to Yangmeishan Hunan Coal Mine, the entire line is about 15 kilometers long, built during the Anti-Japanese War. The Canton-Hankow Railway's southern section relies heavily on this area for coal supply, currently producing 600 tons per day, with plans to expand to 1,000 tons. (2) Xiangjiang Branch Line: from Xianghekou to Yangjiaqiao Xiangjiang Coal Mine. This line was newly built after the restoration. It produces 500 tons of coal per day. The Canton-Hankow Railway's northern section obtains coal from here and is currently planning to use US aid to expand, hoping to increase production to 2,500 tons per day in the future. (3) Zixing Branch Line: This existed before the war but was destroyed and is awaiting funding for repairs. (4) Nanling Branch Line:</p>
<p>With the help of Chairman Soong Tzu-wen, the section from Pingshi to Nanling is currently under active construction. There are two mines in this area: Baziling and Gouyadong. It is expected that after one year, the two mines can produce 1,000 tons of coal per day. (5) Zhongxiang Branch Line: from Xiashankou to Tanjia Shan Zhongxiang Coal Mine, the total length is more than 20 kilometers, awaiting funding for construction. (6) Huxiang Branch Line: from Xiangtan to Luojiatang Huxiang Coal Mine, which has been approved by the Ministry of Communications and is awaiting funding for construction. It currently produces 170 tons of coal per day and is expected to expand to 3,000 tons in the future. (7) Xiangtan-Xinhua Line: Once this line is built, there will be five coal mines that can be exploited: Hongshangdian, Enkou, Fengguanshan, Mingjingjing, and Yanjiapu. (8) The Liling, Pingxiang, and Gaokeng mining areas are all connected to the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway in Zhuzhou. The three mines currently produce 1,500 tons per day. If these eight branch lines are completed, the Canton-Hankow Railway will have a daily coal production of 20,000 tons. Not only will the Canton-Hankow Railway and the industrial coal demand in South China no longer be a concern, but there will also be a surplus to solve part of the coal shortage in the Shanghai-Nanjing area. At that time, the transportation business of the Canton-Hankow Railway will also flourish. The completion of this plan is not too far away. The Canton-Hankow Railway Bureau plans to build so many branch lines within two years. Of course, solving the transportation problem alone is not enough. At the same time, the local economic strength of Hunan and Hubei provinces is not sufficient to develop these many mineral resources on a large scale. They earnestly hope that entrepreneurs with vision from all over the country and overseas Chinese can invest here and jointly develop this virgin mining territory.</p>
<h3>Guangzhou Power Plant Site Selected: Two Villages in Henan</h3>
<p>Villagers Push Representatives to File Administrative Appeal</p>
<p>[Our Report from Guangzhou, 12th (Airmail)] More than 70 *mu* of farmland in the villages of Nantoushi and Diyuan in Henan, Guangzhou, have been publicly announced by the Guangzhou Municipal Government to be requisitioned for the site of the Guangzhou Power Plant. The people of the two villages are extremely dissatisfied. They believe that east of the Nantoushi Provincial Paper Mill, there are earthen mounds and barren land that stretches for several miles, mostly government-owned wasteland. It faces the Pearl River in the front and is connected to the highway in the back. The site is spacious, elevated, and flat, with convenient transportation. Moreover, the Municipal Government's Design Committee had long designated this area and dozens of *li* of land along the river to the east as an industrial zone. This government-owned wasteland is a natural factory site. If a factory is built there, it will not only reduce the compensation for land requisition but also avoid disrupting agricultural production, benefiting both public and private interests. Now, the Municipal Government is abandoning this natural government-owned factory site and insisting on requisitioning as much farmland as possible from the two villages, which 40-odd households and more than 300 people depend on for their livelihoods. This not only violates the law and harms farmers but also goes against the government's intention to support farmers and increase production. They have elected representatives Xie Mingde, Wu Sen, and Liang Hede to file an administrative appeal to fight for their survival.</p>
<h3>The Black Current in Jiangxi</h3>
<p>— Our Reporter Liu Zao</p>
<p>[Our Report from Nanchang, 13th (Express)] The security situation in Jiangxi at the current stage, since the provincial authorities decided to suppress clan fighting in various counties and stop factional struggles, is indeed much quieter than it was half a year ago. Although the incidents that occur in this kind of physical fighting among uneducated people and nervous infighting among intellectuals are only local disputes, the internal struggle will affect the tranquility of a county or even the entire province. For example, the clan fighting in Yuqian was stopped by Wu Chuikun, the chief of staff sent by the Provincial Security Command. The weapons confiscated from both sides, in terms of light and heavy machine guns alone, amounted to 30, and rifles numbered 212. The loss of life and property caused by these weapons in physical combat is considerable. Furthermore, the time spent on clan fighting and the number of people mobilized to participate in the war are also frightening. Last year, in the Battle of Fenyi, the front lines where both sides were waiting in strict formation extended for two to three hundred *li*. The number of people mobilized included those from related counties such as Xinyu, Wanzai, Shanggao, and Yichun, or those of the same clan. Regardless of men, women, old, or young, those encountered on the battlefield were treated as "enemies," captured and killed without question!</p>
<p>Gang Activities</p>
<p>Let's look at the activities of gangs and the actual harm they cause to the local area. This is indeed a "major landmine" in Jiangxi. Since the formation of the so-called New Social Enterprise Construction Association last year, people who are accustomed to engaging in political activities or attempting to use it as a political capital for competition have taken this opportunity to infiltrate, engaging in personal secret activities, recruiting followers, and even ambitious people who already have considerable status in society are willing to kneel and worship, to become disciples, and call them "big brother." The common people in the countryside are also confused and drawn in by these people. Otherwise, if you are an honest and law-abiding person, they will make it impossible for you to be "honest." The activities of these elements have formed a huge "black current" in cities and towns. Not only do the common people not dare to disobey, but even the county government can do nothing about them. For example, my hometown—Taihe—is a stronghold of these rampant elements. The people in the county government are all in the circle, and even the deputy commander of the Security Command is the mastermind behind the scenes. What can the common people say? They can only listen to their arrangements!</p>
<p>The provincial authorities are determined to eliminate these hegemonic forces for the benefit of society. First, they used heavy troops to clear the countryside in Taihe, exposing the gang members and revealing a conspiracy of theirs: the gang members attempted to collude with Li Jishen in Guinan to transport guns to Taihe, preparing to occupy Jinggangshan, the old nest of Zhu and Mao, with underground workers of the local bandits.</p>
<p>Now, clan fighting incidents are relatively calm, and they dare not openly command the troops, set up strict formations, and rush to kill as if facing a formidable enemy. Since the countryside was cleared in Taihe and several gang leaders were arrested and severely punished, this trend has also been slightly curbed. However, the roots of these two "black tides" are still buried in every corner of Jiangxi, and the local activities of bandit elements are equally worrisome. Everyone knows that Jiangxi was the base area where Zhu and Mao raised their banner 20 years ago. So many "old Jiangxi folks" were dragged into the bandit ranks by these two devils. Not to mention those who died, there are also those who are still alive and serving as cadres in the bandit army. Therefore, Jiangxi may be considered their "hometown" by them. Here is a report based on official intelligence about the bandits around Jiangxi:</p>
<p>Underground Bandits</p>
<p>As mentioned earlier, the current local security problems in Jiangxi include clan fighting, factionalism, and gang hegemony, forming a general "black current" that endangers local security. Therefore, the bandits are more likely to use these internal hegemonies to engage in their underground activities.</p>
<p>At present, although there are no bandit armies or local communists active in the core areas of Jiangxi, the evil seeds of the bandits have been planted around the borders with neighboring provinces, developing from underground activities into banditry, robbery, propaganda, and organization.</p>
<p>In southern Jiangxi, the area was formerly the activity range of the bandit's Guangdong-Eastern Detachment. Now, they have renamed themselves the Guangdong-Jiangxi-Zhejiang Border Area People's Liberation General Detachment, with Huang Ye as the commander, Liu Xinchao as the deputy commander, and Shao Guoliang as the detachment leader, totaling nearly 1,000 men. After several maneuvers, they sometimes confront in groups and sometimes break up into smaller units, hiding deep in the mountains and harassing the border areas of the three provinces. They are still based in Yushan Maozifeng. Liu Xionghu's unit occasionally robs in Guidong, Rucheng, and Suichuan in the border areas of Zhejiang and Jiangxi. Liu's bandits' attempt to occupy this area is, on the one hand, to harass the southern section of the Canton-Hankow Railway when necessary, and on the other hand, to take the opportunity to enter Jinggangshan to establish the so-called Western Jiangxi base area.</p>
<p>Guangfeng and Chong'an in eastern Jiangxi are the base areas of the bandit Wang Wenbo's unit. He currently has 120 men and frequently appears in the Jiangxi-Fujian border area, being suppressed in one place and fleeing to another. As for Xiong Zhaoren's unit, calling himself the "Commander of the Soviet-Zhejiang-Anhui-Jiangxi Border Area People's Liberation Army," has 500 men and occupies the areas of Yi County, Zhanggong Mountain, Shuilanshan, Huangcun, and Daxin Mountain in Anhui, occasionally harassing Dexing and Fuliang in Jiangxi.</p>
<p>Northern Jiangxi Area</p>
<p>The Mufu Mountains in northern Jiangxi are an ideal base area in the border area of Zhejiang, Hubei and Jiangxi. They can invade the Jiujiang-Nanchang Railway to the east, peek at Xianning and Wuhan in southern Hubei to the west, and Changhe, an important town in northern Zhejiang. According to investigations by responsible parties, underground workers of the bandits have already been spotted in this area, engaging in military organization. However, the areas of Xiushui and Tonggu in Jiangxi are fortunately safe.</p>
<p>However, the threat to northern Jiangxi now comes from Huangmei and Guangji in northern Jiangxi, that is, the Dabie Mountains area. The poisonous bacteria and local communists left behind by Liu Bocheng, calling themselves Commander Wang Linsheng of the Hubei-Henan Military Region, and Zhang Guoquan, the commander of the First Military Subdistrict, are responsible for the Huanggang area in eastern Hubei, as well as Zhao Xinchu, the so-called administrative commissioner of eastern Hubei stationed in Qinan, Ma Qi, the commander of the backbone regiment, and Zou Yiqing and Cai Qiong, local communists in Huanggang. Their current strength is about 5,000 men, and the number of guns and bullets is unknown. In the middle of last month, more than 3,000 men from Zhang Guoquan's unit once roamed the area north of Huanggang, and at the time, we speculated that they might want to use the usual trick of "big eating small" to "eat" our security regiment in Konglonglongping and Wuxue on the banks of the Yangtze River. Therefore, the Jiangxi Provincial Security Command immediately dispatched three regiments to northern Jiangxi to strengthen defenses and prepare to prevent them from fleeing south. However, after Zhang's unit robbed part of the grain and cotton in Dahepu, Jingzhupu, and Houshanpu in the area north of Huanggang, they saw the strengthening of the river defense forces and did not dare to try, and returned to Da Yangmiao, Tongzihe Lotus Nunnery, Liu Gonghe, and the original occupied areas to engage in reorganization.</p>

<h3>Floating Corpses Continue to Wash Ashore in Zhenhai; Total Reaches Eleven</h3>
<p>[Our Report from Zhenhai, 14th] Three male floating corpses were found in the Houhaitang area of this county on the 11th (the previous report mistakenly stated two corpses), and it was determined upon inspection that one was approximately 60 years old, one was in their 30s, and one was around 30 years old. One corpse had a private seal with the three characters "Liu Jinyin" on it. There were no injuries, and it was determined that they died from drowning. The day before, six floating corpses, four men and two women, that had drifted from overseas were found on the Jiangjiatu beach in Qingzhi. One male corpse had an employee certificate with the following details: "Name: Ju Zija, 28 years old, Rongcheng County, Shandong Province, working as a tally clerk for Yiyun Transportation." There was also a Qingdao Fushun Shipping Company card. Also, the day before, a male corpse also washed ashore on the beach of the first *bao* in Longshan. On the morning of the 14th, another male corpse washed ashore on the Jiangnan Niwan beach. The local *baozhang* buried them according to the law. In total, eleven floating corpses have washed ashore in this county in four days. It is believed that a sea vessel capsized in the Zhejiang Sea due to wind.</p>

<p>[Reply to Mr. Qian Zicheng from Guangzhou] Regarding the matter of changing your name, the Ministry of Interior has promulgated regulations. Students at all levels of schools who apply to change their name must also comply with the restrictions promulgated by the Ministry of Education, that is, it is limited to cases where the name is completely identical within the scope of the school's location and is easily confused. It is also limited to students of public or registered private schools. Students of unregistered private schools will not be accepted.</p>
<p>[Reply to Mr. Zhang Youjiao] Since your elder cousin has reached adulthood, she can make her own decisions about marriage, and her mother cannot object. However, your maternal aunt is nearly 70 years old, and your elder cousin will be alone after marriage, lacking someone to care for her. Your elder cousin and her future brother-in-law have a legal and moral obligation to support her.</p>
<p>[Reply to Mr. Ding Yongnian from Nanjing] The creditor's request to calculate based on the price of rice has no legal basis. The debtor's investment to calculate official interest is also unrealistic and unreasonable. It seems that seeking a fair and reasonable solution through mediation is the best strategy.</p>
<p>[Reply to Mr. Zhang Xiangxian from Shanghai] Your nephew has registered his household at your place and has a national identity card, so he should enjoy the rights and bear the obligations that citizens are entitled to. Even if he does not stay at your place every night, this is the freedom of residence of the people, which is clearly stipulated in the Constitution. If he has not registered his household repeatedly elsewhere, then how can the village chief interfere with his freedom of residence and deprive him of the rights he should enjoy?</p>
<p>[Reply to Ms. Youlan] In response to the two questions you asked, attorney Jiang Pingdang answers as follows: (1) An application for parole should be made to the prison warden. (2) The date of imprisonment and the date of prohibition should be calculated together. If the case has been under review for more than one year and two months, an application for bail can be made to the original court.</p>

<h3>Imitation and Counterfeit</h3>
<p>— Xi</p>
<p>Commerce values morality, but in order to maximize profits, it rarely takes morality into account. Therefore, the "gentleman's country" style will always be just a mirage in the "Romance of the Flowers in the Mirror."</p>
<p>The lack of morality in commerce includes fraud, such as selling inferior goods at inflated prices. Imitation and the use of similar names or trademarks of other businesses constitute infringement.</p>
<p>The Commercial Registration Law clearly stipulates that in the same city or county, one cannot use the name of a business that has already been registered by another. The Trademark Law also clarifies that a registered trademark has exclusive rights. However, in this society, the most blatant violation of the law is the imitation and use of "business names" or "trademarks."</p>
<p>Regarding imitation: if you use "Two Three Cats" as a trademark, I will use "Three Tigers." If you are called "Yellow Mazi," I will call myself "Wang Mazi." The use of similar names is even more common and easily found. The most common is that "Lu Gao Jian" has come to represent "butcher shops," and Cantonese restaurants must each have a "Zhengxing Restaurant." I have never understood why the original creators do not file lawsuits with the court based on Article 22 of the Commercial Registration Law or Article 37 of the Trademark Law. Perhaps in fact, everyone is a counterfeit, so in many "genuine" "old shops," who is the "original old shop" is just like the same storefront signs of the two Ya Li shops across from the "Great Stage," only "God knows."</p>
<p>There was a type of "××× Flower Dew Cologne" that was popular before the war and indeed had effects (removing dampness and reducing swelling). After the victory, in order to treat mosquito bites for my child, I bought a bottle, but it had no effect after application. I thought that the product might have been made with shoddy materials or stored for too long, causing a chemical reaction and eliminating the effect. It wasn't until the original producer of the "××× Flower Dew Cologne" published a notice in the newspaper that I learned that the exclusive right to use the trademark had expired during the war and had not been renewed in time, resulting in it being used by others.</p>
<p>In addition, a chemical factory produced "mosquito coils" with a brand that was very similar to a famous trademark of an old business, which aroused attacks from the industry. I don't know what its own quality is, but because of its despicable imitation, I would rather buy other new brand products. Unexpectedly, another product of the factory, "×× Soap," was of very high quality. From this, I inferred that the mosquito coils produced might not be too bad. However, because of the imitation of other people's trademarks, people are unwilling to buy it, which is something that the imitator did not expect.</p>
<p>Based on the above two facts, we know that as long as the products are excellent, there is no need to imitate or use the famous shop names and trademarks of others. Conversely, even if the imitation is successful (such as a product that has already enjoyed a good reputation, the trademark is not registered, or the exclusive right has expired), and the product is inferior, it will at most make people suffer once.</p>
<p>However, to fundamentally eliminate the immorality of imitation and use of similar names, only customers themselves can eliminate the blind worship of "old brands" with the mentality of "only recognizing the sign and not looking at the goods"; otherwise, it is the customers themselves who suffer.</p>
<h3>Silver Seal of the Former Qing Imperial Library</h3>
<p>— Miao Zibin</p>
<p>The other day, I read Ling Ruohai's *Aoge Tan Hui*, which mentioned the seals used by the abdicated Qing Dynasty. Here, I will talk about the silver seal of the Imperial Library, which I think those who talk about the anecdotes of the abdicated Qing Dynasty will also be happy to hear.</p>
<p>My late father, Yifeng, disagreed with the principal of the Hanlin Academy, Xu Tong, in the Guangxu year of Jiawu (1894) and asked for leave to return to the countryside. He devoted himself to the study of epigraphy and bibliography for 30 years. When Zhang Wenxiang (Zhidong) was appointed as Grand Secretary, he repeatedly invited him to come out of seclusion. In May of the first year of Xuantong, the Ministry of Education submitted a memorial appointing him as the Director of the Imperial Library, with Xu Wusheng (Fang) as the Deputy Director. Telegrams and letters were sent back and forth, urging him to take office. He arrived in Beijing in September of the second year, but Zhang Wenxiang had already passed away the year before. At that time, the library had not yet been built and was opened in Guanghua Temple on Jishuitan in the northern part of the city. The books were all taken from the large warehouse of the Cabinet, and the old books of the Song and Yuan Dynasties were ancient and fragrant. In the winter of that year, the ministry issued a seal, a silver square, with the inscription "Seal of the Imperial Library." This official position was newly established, the same as the Director of the Imperial College, both being substantive positions, so the seal was square and made of silver. My late father often joked about this, saying that he had also been a *zheng yin* official (all those with square seals were *zheng yin* officials). In the following year, Xinhai (1911), the revolution was successful, and the Qing court abdicated. This seal was in use for less than a year, making it the shortest-lived of the seals, and I am afraid it was also the last silver seal cast by the Qing Ministry.</p>
<h3>Single People</h3>
<p>— Zhong Jian</p>
<p>From a medical and national standpoint, late marriage and singlehood are both harmful. Therefore, Europe has historically had laws restricting singlehood.</p>
<p>In the year 9 AD, the Roman Emperor Augustus stipulated by law that single people had no right to inherit property, and even married couples without children could not inherit each other's property. Sparta and Athens imposed fines on single people, the purpose of which was, of course, to encourage marriage and increase fertility.</p>
<p>England adopted a taxation approach. A law in 1695 stipulated that single people and childless widowers should pay an annual tax ranging from one shilling to twelve pounds and ten shillings, depending on the severity of their circumstances. In 1785, a bill was passed to impose heavy taxes on single servants as well. In recent years, with the implementation of income tax, married people with children are taxed lightly, while single people pay higher tax rates.</p>
<h3>Yang Haosou's Manuscripts</h3>
<p>— Qian Dacheng</p>
<p>Yang Haosou was renowned throughout the country for his skill in small seal script. His writings, however, were never published, and his descendants disseminated them widely throughout Jiangnan. I once obtained his manuscript of "Annotations on Guanzi" and his hand-annotated "Inscriptions on Bronzes and Tripods from the Jigu Studio." A few years ago, due to financial difficulties, I sold them for rice. Wang Junlin, on the other hand, obtained his hand-annotated "Five Readings of Zhuangzi," and the Shen family has an even larger collection of his manuscripts. This autumn, I borrowed a large volume of Haosou's collected works manuscript from Mr. Cao Jusheng. After reading it for over a month, I found that his writing was not entirely refined. However, Haosou served as a secretary for Zhang Wenyi (Fu) for a long time. When generals consulted him during the Xianfeng and Tongzhi eras, his words were always well-founded. Moreover, he was versed in the Six Scripts of Shuowen Jiezi and cannot be regarded merely as a literatus. This manuscript was punctuated and annotated by Xu Ziling (Xishu) of Hefei, with numerous marginal notes and revisions, and several articles were deleted. At the beginning of the volume, Ziling inscribed: "Your esteemed collection is peaceful and elegant, demonstrating erudition and cultivation. The best passages are serene and simple, increasingly plain and wonderful. Regarding the selection and deletion of content, I hope you will understand! Summer of the Guiyou year of Tongzhi, inscribed by Ziling while relying on his luggage." His article "Proposal for the Temporary Establishment of a Governor of Southern Anhui" has a postscript by Xia Qi. Several pages of this manuscript are in Haosou's own handwriting. Yesterday, I saw another manuscript of Haosou's writings at Jusheng's place, which was hand-copied by his son Tongfu (Sizai) and also contains many poems, with a preface and postscript by Zhao Liewen. His poems were criticized severely by Liewen, who also advised him to delete several poems. The ancients' attitude of accepting good advice is evident here, and it is not just his literary talent and calligraphy that are admirable.</p>
<p>Haosou's given name was Yisun, and his courtesy name was Yichun. He was a native of Changshu. He was a Qing Dynasty licentiate and served as the prefect of Fengyang, known for his competence. At the age of twenty, he was fond of Deng Yuanbai's calligraphy. At that time, no one in Suzhou praised Wanbai's calligraphy. In the Bingwu year of Daoguang, Wanbai's son Shouzhi came to Changshu, and he gained a better understanding of his calligraphy and learned the rudiments of seal and clerical scripts. When he was an official in Xin'an, he acquired over eighty scrolls of Wanbai's calligraphy, covering all four scripts. During the Gengshen year of turmoil, he lost them all. Later, Zeng Wenzheng and others admired Wanbai's calligraphy, and its reputation increased, with a single scroll fetching a hundred taels of silver. Haosou once said, "Wanbai's calligraphy should be considered the best of this dynasty." Modern people all know to cherish Wanbai's calligraphy, and this really started with Haosou. Moreover, Haosou's small seal script, which made him famous, also owed much to Wanbai.</p>
<p>The collected works contain a great deal of historical material related to the Xianfeng and Tongzhi periods of the Qing Dynasty, especially detailed accounts of the discord between Zeng Wenzheng and Zhang Wenyi, which will not be elaborated upon here.</p>
<h3>Snippets from America</h3>
<p>— Cang Yu</p>
<p>In major American cities, cars are congested, and parking is extremely difficult to find. Bankers, with a twist of mind, have added "drive-in" savings departments. Customers can drive straight into the bank to withdraw money and choose a parking space in front of the many offices in the savings department to handle deposit and withdrawal procedures. Customers can sit in their cars without having to get out. Currently, there are over 250 banks nationwide that have opened this type of savings department.</p>
<p>The United States has an organization called the Tall People's Club. Men must be taller than six feet two inches and women must be taller than five feet ten inches to be eligible to join. The club holds two conventions each year. This year, it was held in Chicago, and 300 male and female members attended. As usual, telegrams were sent requesting that the berths on trains be lengthened and public telephone booths be raised to protect the interests of tall people. Mary Lorenga, who is six feet one and a half inches tall, was crowned and named "Tall Person Queen of 1948."</p>
<h3>Notes from Reading</h3>
<p>— Ze Shi</p>
<p>Recently, after reading Harold Laski's "The American Presidency," I couldn't help but feel the difficulty of being a president, and I issued an order to my children: "From now on, you are not allowed to sing 'With a red face, you will become a great president' anymore."</p>
<p>It turns out that one of the difficulties of being an American president, according to Laski, is that the tasks are too numerous. Just the ceremonial duties alone are enough to exhaust him. For example, when a portrait of George V is sent from England, he has to attend the acceptance ceremony. When the National Education Conference opens, he has to make some formal remarks. On Washington's birthday, he has to give a speech, and on Lincoln's memorial day, he has to make a grand speech again. He has to give instructions to the Boy Scouts and welcome foreign princes and nobles. He has to review troops and visit major national projects. He has to travel frequently, otherwise people will say that he treats the capital, Washington, as the entire United States, and the travels must be carefully planned, because he has to pay attention to the political feedback. He has to give a speech in every place he visits. If he misses one, he will offend the local people and the congressman from that area, and they will inevitably find loopholes to take revenge. Moreover, all of this takes place under the watchful eyes of ruthless journalists, and any casual word or deed can become a topic of national conversation, and even his wife's behavior must be careful...</p>
<p>Laski's argument is very credible. I have also seen a story in another book about a president who shook hands with people all day and bled. But the ceremonial hardships are still manageable. What makes the American president mentally exhausted is that he cannot make decisions independently in political affairs and is constantly disrupted by the Senate and House of Representatives. Disruption is by no means an abuse of the word. The American political system absolutely separates executive and legislative powers. Members of the House of Representatives never forget that they are equal to the president and are most afraid that the parliament will become a rubber stamp for the president. Therefore, they argue vigorously against every presidential proposal, at least discounting it by 20% or 30%, and if things go badly, it will be "returned to the sender." And the president must initiate all bills. Regardless of whether it is for the benefit of the country and the people, for world peace, or for world war, he must first endure the criticism and investigation of the members of the House of Representatives, who are only responsible for criticism. It is a thankless task, truly the bitter fate of the American president!</p>
<p>However, although the history of the United States is short, it has never been "without a ruler for a day." Is this because human nature is good - willing to sacrifice oneself for the benefit of the country and the people? Or is it because human nature is evil - willing to risk death to eat pufferfish? This is truly worth thinking about in detail and exploring thoroughly.</p>
<p>###</p>
<p>The change in the lives of the general public can be most conveniently referenced by the price of hiring labor. The high or low price demanded by rickshaw pullers is entirely based on the price of food. Before the currency reform, hiring three vehicles (or two vehicles) would start at "several tens of thousands." In the twenty-odd days after the currency reform, it started at "seven something" (meaning 300,000 legal tender as a unit), and now for slightly longer distances, it starts at "several yuan"! From this, it can be seen that the rate of soaring prices of other goods also has a tendency to rise in a straight line! (For example, from Zhengyang Gate to the back gate, hiring a rickshaw before the currency reform cost only 200,000 legal tender, but now it costs 1.5 to 2 yuan, and 5-6 million legal tender is still the price of two catties of mixed flour.)</p>
<p>With the opening of "price limits," all shops opened as usual, and the shelves were once again full of goods. Buyers enjoyed getting goods, and sellers had business to do, and they all showed vitality. It looked like a market. The failure of this currency reform has already been publicly acknowledged by the Weng Ge authorities, who have resigned several times. Major economic experts have made many famous remarks on this, mostly focusing only on the restrictive aspect and forgetting the whole picture. Pinning down the city, but not the countryside; pinning down legitimate businesses, but not the black market. It is like sawing a bowl. You have to consider all the parts and calculate how many saws and which parts to use before starting. If you rashly put effort into one or two places, then one pin and two pins will make the whole bowl even more broken and flawed.</p>
<p>Beijing has not yet experienced large-scale panic buying like Shanghai. However, "panic selling" occurs from time to time and is often heard. One type is selling woolen clothes, towels, and socks. At every market, temple fair, and busy street corner, there are often large piles and boxes of goods, with two or three people standing beside them, shouting loudly, sweating profusely (with a strong Tianjin accent), calling out that these are "goods from closed shops," "specially selling cheap," "sell them all, then they are gone," "buy them and sell them, all make money!" This attracts crowds, who rush to buy them. However, this "panic buying" is brought about by "panic selling." Their goods are always "goods from closed shops" (but who knows how many closed shops there are, throwing away their goods!), they are always shouting "sell them all, then they are gone," but they are never gone. The price is slightly cheaper than the shops and regular stalls, but with such a shout, it seems much cheaper. Another type is selling cigarettes, pushing carts or carrying baskets, with colorful slogans pasted on them, saying that these are newly released brands and that they are not afraid of costs for promotion, either buying two packs and getting one free, or buying one pack and getting a box of matches free. The types of cigarettes they choose are sometimes newly released products and sometimes unpopular goods, with reasonable prices and not very bad quality. Regular stalls also have them, but they are placed below various high-end cigarettes and are not noticed, and the prices are not consistent. These hawkers are good at seizing opportunities, gathering a large collection, and traveling around the city, preparing an empty wooden box or a large basket, specially for throwing banknotes in. The gold yuan coupons and customs gold certificates (legal tender), colorful, are piled and thrown around like a cornucopia, making the salarymen holding hundreds of yuan of gold coupons feel ashamed of their own insignificance.</p>
<p>In addition, some small merchants sell small furniture and daily necessities such as soap and magnets at any time, making the city look prosperous.</p>
