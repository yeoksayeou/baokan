<p>〔中央社南京廿六日電〕共匪投誠之「勞動英雄」吳滿有及「豫鄂皖邊區副主席」楊經曲，自廿六日起在國防部政工局軍中廣播電台開始播講，廿七·廿八兩日仍在該合織續播講，時間為每日下午一時廿五分及八時廿分兩次，該合長波為四一六·六公尺，週率七二〇千過。短波為二四·六公尺，週率一二二〇〇千週，同時並由本市中央·空軍·首都·益世·金陵·建業·靑年各電·及漢口·西安·北平·廣州·瀋陽各地軍中分台聯合轉播，茲錄渠等廿六目廣播詞原文如後：</p>
<p>吳滿有廣播詞全文</p>
<p>親愛的父老兄弟姐妹們，我姓吳，名字呌滿有，今年五十五歲，陝北延安吳家棗園人，共匪為了利用我，選我為邊區的勞動英雄，曾做過延安縣參議會的副議長，農民大學校長，優待紅軍眷屬主任二總隊民運部科長，擔架隊長。去年國軍克服延安，我被迫參軍，今年四月隨彭德懷部隊在　東作戰，被國軍俘虜，滿以爲必定會死，出乎意外的，我不僅沒有死，而且處處享受政府的愛獲和優待，一切言論行動和日常生活都非常自由，我在政府六個月，我的身體長胖了八九斤，這是値得吿慰在匪區關心我的各位的。</p>
<p>我是一個大字不識的莊稼漢，毛澤東和他的匪徒利用花言巧語，哄我當勞動英雄，當副議長，當大學校長，其實他們不過是着重了我會搞生產，認為我老實可欺，就利用些好聽的頭銜，把我摔得高高的，骨子裏就是要我同我一樣的莊稼漢爲他舞出死力搞生產解決他們部隊和機關的糧荒。自從廿七年到卅五年，我一家就交公糧二百多祖，我自己所得到的只是虛偽的勞動英雄和挨餓的肚皮，毛澤東騙人的本事，傎是够　的。</p>
<p>自到政府區域以後，我經過了西安，我又到了南京，走過了城市，到過了鄉村，我所看到的，我所聽到的，與陝北比較起來，實在是夫堂和地獄之別。政府區域的老百姓，講話行動都可自由，交稅納糧却非常的輕，不像共匪隨便的，無止境的榨取，就是征兵，也按合理的手續去征集，不像共匪用鬥爭裏脅的辦法，不分老幼男女的一把抓，簡單的說，政府區械的老百姓，生命財產都有完全的保障，因此，我明白了毛澤東對於政府的批評完全是出於惡意的宣傳和誣　。</p>
<p>現在政府實行幣制改革以後，一切物價都非常安定，因此，種田，經商的人都感覺得有辦法，有希望，大家都在政府的帮助下，努力於自己的耕種和生產，大家都在足衣足食的度着安定的日子，所以我要奉勸在匪區的同胞，你舞不要再受共匪的欺騙了，趕快團結起來，對匪實行不合作，只要我們老百姓不受他們的利用，共匪的叛亂就不成了，政府卽可實行全面建設，我們就可得到安樂的日子。（下文轉入第二版）</p>

<h3 id="c21">社論　蘇聯對日問題的新態度 <a href="#c21" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e21" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">21</a></h3>
<p>蘇聯對日問題的態度，近來忽有新的轉變。關於日本和約的締結，蘇聯主張召開和會；關於日本工業水準的限度，駐美大使潘友新於廿三日在遠東委員會提出新建議一件，主張日本工業應發展為平時工業，惟此種工業復興之管制，應由最關心阻止日本作新侵略之國家等執行之；並謂日本工業在各强國管制下予以數年無限制之重振，以阻止日本建設新軍事機構，其本身不足為患。潘友新的建議公佈後，美國官方深感　異，日本朝野更感興奮。如果這個建頗出於誠意，絲毫不帶烟幕作用的話，這對於美蘇遠東關係的改善，及對日本問題的澄淸，確為一　値得注意的事。</p>
<p>日本戰敗投降已三年餘，不僅對日和的未極結，甚至近和會預備會議的程序問題，列國尙爭執未決·由於美蘇關係的對立，遠東委員會黯然無光；由於管制當局意見的分歧，東京對日管制會的集會，每在短促的時光中，不歡而散。蘇聯不滿美國管制日本政策的獨斷，但又不提出積極性建般性的辦法，以作改善的張本；美國不理會盟國和遠委會的干涉，積極的片面的扶植日本，多次發表提高日本工業水準的報吿　，刺激遠東國家的民族感情。這種不合理不規則的現象，繼續發展下去，美蘇關係的前途是可憂的，而遠東國家對日本新侵略的恐懼，前途尤屬可憂。站在中國的立塲，我們實不取這個惡劣情勢發展下去，我們願見美蘇的合詣，日本問題優局的打開，更顧一個和平民主的日本，在和約的監督管制下實現，從而恢復中日友好的關係。基於這個觀點，我們對於蘇聯態度的轉發，除了寄予注視的目光以外，並願督智的政治家，迅謀僵局打開之道，切勿以此作為冷戰的表演。</p>
<p>美蘇在遠東的矛盾和對立，最大的問題是韓國和日本的問題。韓國問題表面上是僵了，實際上祗要美蘇一轉念，韓國問題便可獲得和平統一的解決。日本問題比較複雜，而唯一解決的途徑，是召集對日和會，締結日本和約。和會程序問題之爭，是爭優勢，如果和約內容的意見一致，否決權的持有，乃是次要問題。和約內容的關鍵在經濟，而經濟的核心問題，則在日本工業水準的決定，它旣與賠償問題有關，又與日本政治體制和人民生活有關。年來蘇聯的態度，是反對日本高工業水準的，是抨擊日本經濟復興的，對於「史特萊克報吿書」「强斯教計劃」，更予無情的反駁。其實此二計劃，美國尙未當作官方文件向遠東委會提出，遠東委員會國家對美仍有妥協的捷徑可歸。　友新氏的　　，有幾男值得注意：第一·他不反對日本高工業水準，但以平時工業為限；第二·他不反對日本經濟復興，但應在各國管制之下執行；第三·他强調賠償，並滿足遭受侵略之書的國家的要求；最後，他聲明蘇聯政府並無理由需要限制日本未來工業。潘氏為蘇聯年靑而謹愼的外交家，熱知遠東情勢，他的話代表蘇聯政府而發言，他的新建議是否為美國政府所重視，我們不願遽加判斷。不過，蘇聯對日問題態度的轉變，則為一種新的事實。站在中國立塲，我們對於蘇聯的新態度，是感到興趣的。因此我們顧等待遠東委員會對蘇聯新建議的反響，從而謀取妥協的捷徑。</p>
<p>關於確定日本工業水準的問題，我們在理論上並不贊成「史特萊克報吿書」和「强斯敦計劃」，我們認為現階段確定日本工業的原則，一九四七年一月廿三日遠東委員會通過有「日本平時需要的決定」（Determination　of　Peaceful　Needs　ofJapm）一案，各會員國家代表曾舉手贊成，從未有人提出異議。潘友新氏新建議，可能是根據本案，這顯示蘇聯的意見在於促成對日和約的完成·我國對於本案是贊成的，美國官方亦從未提出本案的修正，所以本案在法理上是存在的。遠東委員會會員國對日本工業水準原則，旣無多大的扞格，在情勢上，應是召開對日和會的時期了。因此我們重新提出主張，希望美蘇進一步的協調，迅速召開和會，締結日本和約，將危疑不定的日本問題，作一澄淸的解決。</p>

<p>楊經曲廣播詞全文</p>
<p>全國父老兄弟姊妹們，我姓楊，名經曲，是民國廿九年八月參加共匪新四軍豫鄂邊區李先念部的，曾任該邊區政府副主席，旅長，支隊司令及第三軍分區司令，在匪區先後五年零十一個月，直到肝五年七月才脫離共匪。</p>
<p>在這六年的過程中，我瞭解了共匪的一切，現在讓我來作一次簡短的報吿，使我全國同胞認識共匪的眞面目。</p>
<p>（上接第一版）</p>
<p>首先我要說明的，共產黨是無祖國的，他們的口號是世界革命，他們是受共產國際（也就是蘇聯）指揮的，共產國際高於一切，也就是說他們一切都為了共產國際，為了蘇聯，如果是有利於蘇聯，而不利於祖國的事發生，他們會毫不運疑的斷送祖國的，從東北問題看中共的態度，從蘇聯拒絕中國參加對德和約外長會議看中共的言諭，他們完全是站在與蘇聯一致的立塲，出賣祖國的，這就證明了中國共產黨如果成功，中國就成了蘇聯的屬國，不再成其為中國了。</p>
<p>共產黨是主張無產階級革命的，而中國共產黨所造成的是流氓專政，他們不但用暴力沒收中產階級的財產，進行殘酷的淸算鬥爭，而且用「支援前綫和獻糧的名義，沒收農民以勞力換來的糧食」，在嚴格的鬥爭淸算之後，工廠沒有人辦，工人沒有出路，都成了共匪的俘虜，共匪壓迫工人參軍充砲灰，或者壓迫工人付出他所能負担的工作，而共匪對工人的福利和健康，是毫不顧惜的，所以共匪雖喊農工革命，無產階級專政，而實際上農人是牛馬，工人是奴隸，善良的農工是被剝削者，被壓迫者，共匪祗是利用他們勞力作增產工具，利用他們的生命作叛亂資本。</p>
<p>而一般地痞流氓不事生產，專靠鬥爭別人養活自己，他們成了新的寄生蟲，代替了舊的剝削者，共匪反認為是積極份子，予以支持與鼓勵，聽憑他們橫行，所以今日的匪區，成了流氓的天下。</p>
<p>共匪對農工是如此，對付中資階級和富豪更是殘暴，不但財產全部鬥光，還要受盡折磨侮辱，最後還要使你慘死。</p>
<p>所以我希望全國同胞，認淸共匪的作風與手段，一齊起來，為了維護祖國而戡亂，工農階級不要被共匪宣傳所欺騙，如果共匪成功，你們將更苦痛，尤其是富商豪門，如果你們不肯出錢出力，支持政府戡亂，一旦共匪成功，不僅你們的財產立刻化為烏有，而且要死無葬身之地，要保住你們的生命財產，你們要趕快覺悟，拿出錢來支持政府的戡亂，否則將後悔莫及。</p>
<p>最後，我提醒全國同胞，要趕快出錢出力，支持政府實行三民主義，撲滅共匪，以維護祖國的領土·主權的完整，維護民主自由的制度存在，進行溫和的社會革命，避免流血鬥爭，驅除赤色的法西斯，使中華民族重登建設復興的坦途，成為一個自由民主富强康樂的新中國。（完）</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕巴黎二十六日廣播；美英法三國廿大日發表公報稱：關於柏林問題三國與蘇聯之爭執，將提交聯合國安理會處理，此係三國外長於會商後決定者，美方人士稱：三外長擬於廿六日晚再召集會議，那國決定與蘇聯終止談判，主要由於蘇方提出控制空中走廊之要求。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕巴黎廿六日廣播：西方列强專家廿六日下午舉行會議，繼續研究西方列强將柏林問題提交安理會應採之必要步驟。預料三國致蘇聯政府之照會，將邇同說明三國態度之備忘錄同時送交聯合國。三國致蘇聯之覆文將由美駐英大使道格拉斯·英外次史屈朋及法外次繆維爾起草，三國外長或將舉行會議以批准覆文。</p>
<p>〔合衆社巴黎廿六日電〕西方三張廿六日決定將柏林危機提交聯合國安理會，因為蘇聯在答覆三强的「最後照會」中，拒絕解除柏林封鎖，渠等並決定停止直接對蘇聯的談判，而訴諸世界輿論。三强譴責蘇聯最近的照會「不能滿意」，並指斥蘇聯違反四强的諒解，「片面」公佈談判內容。蘇聯最近的照會，不帶為對夏初卽已開始的四張談判的最後一棒。西方發言人稱，「在過去長時期的柏林和莫斯科談判中，蘇聯迄不提出控制柏林興西方佔區間之空中交通的要求」，然而在最近的一次照會中，蘇聯則提出此項反要求，不但企圖控制早在夏初為其封鎖的水陸交通，並且進一步企圖控制空中運輸。</p>
<p>三强之公報略稱：「蘇聯政府未能對三國政府在一九四八年九月廿一日的照會中，提出解除柏林非法封鎖的請求加以保證，而且更提出要求，將柏林與西方佔領區間的一切空中·水道·鐵路·公路的商品運輸和旅客交通，置於德境蘇佔領軍司令的管制之下，而且，關於通貨問題，蘇聯的照會中推諉其辭，對三國政府表示的態度不作明確答覆，因此，三國政府不得不照會蘇聯政府，完全說明彼等之地位，同時通知蘇聯政府，基于蘇聯政府的堅特繼續封鎖及限制空中交通，彼等為遵從聯合國憲軍下之義務，乃被迫將此一事件提交聯合國安理會。」三强外長在進膳前，假法國外交部舉行緊急會議歷時九十分，渠等迅卽同意上項行動，並將在晚間再行會談，以起草渠等對安理會提出之函件。</p>

<p>〔法國新聞社莫斯科廿六日電〕塔斯社今晨發表柏林局勢以及蘇聯與西方三强在八月與九月有關此一問題談判之聲明。該聲明中提及在七月十四日蘇政府致美英法三國之照會中，指出柏林局勢係由於三國破壤彼茨坦協定，以及破壞管制德國與柏林之協定所引起·塔斯社繼稱，西方三强之所以有此項破壤發生，目的乃在於柏林西區單獨當行幣制改革，同時西方三强又企圖達成分裂德國之政策。</p>
<p>該聲明中指斥西方三强力圖伸入德國東部佔區，使東區之經濟宣吿解體，此一局勢遂迫使蘇聯對柏林與西區交通不得不採取限制措施，以保障蘇區德國人民利益及經濟命脈之解體。該聲明中又提及在七月初西方三强曾向蘇聯政府提出共同建議，要求檢討柏林局勢以及由於此事所產生之後果，蘇聯政府對此項建議表示接受。據塔斯社透露，該建議中指出蘇聯與西方三强駐柏林軍事長官八月舉行談判後，同意施行下列各點：（一）柏林與西區三政府之客運貿易以及貨物，由西區運蘇區或蘇區運西區之限制應加解除；（二）同時東區馬克將為柏林之唯一通用之貨幣，西方之馬克應禁止在柏林使用。又稱，四强曾同意西方馬克之流通柏林以及關於柏林貨幣流通條例，應在四强共同管轄之下。根據蘇聯聲明，談判之所以不繼續，係由於蘇聯與西方三强之軍事長官發生三種較見：（一）蘇聯政府堅持對於柏林與西　之旅客及貨物運輸內河及織路運織，　置於蘇竄事長官管制之下，空航綫亦須加以管制；四　亦會同意柏林之貨幣及柏林與西區之運級　加管制。（二）蘇聯認為四强財委會及該會所担任處理之枕一貨幣流通柏林之任務，有遵守四張在莫斯科所締結協定之必要，蘇聯政府不能接受此一委會職能之擴大，致有權千涉有關貨幣流通於全部蘇區之條例。（三）蘇聯政府關於柏林與西區及三國本開之貿易問個，細歸從英美法三國之旨　，在柏林設置四强管制權構，並同意在發出　當之貿易許可證，以便解決關於此一問題現存於四　間之歧點·該聲明結論稱，上述諸事實，足以表示蘇聯政府關於解決柏林局勢之立塲，係以對此問題有關各方可接受之條件為根據。在此項條件下，關於此一問題之談判究應停止抑由四國獲致滿意協定，其唯一關鍵端視美英法之態度如何而定。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕虎標永安堂負責人胡為之，廿四日下午十一時十五分許，投報老閘警分局，謂失竊美鈔三萬九千元正。據胡之報告稱：渠十八日自南京鄭姓友人處取回前存之黃金二百兩及美金五萬元，十九日晨七時抵滬寓寗波路五九五號虎標永安堂分店內，當晚七時許將携來美鈔黃金交與代經理鄭源貴鎖置於保險箱中。復因為數過巨，恐惹人注目，故是晚至波司登皮件公司購很飛機式中式皮箱三只，將美鈔由保險箱取出，藏於皮箱中特製之布袋內。常時由鄭代經理指揮，將美鈔分置於各箱內。至黃金二百兩，已在二十日出售於國貨銀行。廿二日下午六時，將第一隻之淡黃色皮箱拆封，其中分裝之美鈔一萬一千元，如數售與國貨銀行，其餘深黃色皮箱二隻，內儲美金三萬九千元，仍封存臥室中。直至廿四日晨八時左右，有香港總店職員曹秋事（足球健將）偕同金祿兩人自龍華飛機塲送其弟返港，事畢返店，聲稱，飛機塲檢查嚴厲，甚且有人注意其行動，故對存放店中之教，恐有不利，並建議將深黃色皮箱二只，轉藏其友朱姓處。胡因是項美金卽將售與國貨銀行，無須徒勞往返，逕予拒絕。嗣卽由曹秋亭帶去，擬代為解送國貨銀行。詎是晨九時，胡忽接曹之電話云：該兩皮箱內僅有美金一千六百四十元，其餘之款，均已不眞而飛。因事出奇突，遂投局報緝。</p>
<p>老閘警分局長趙肇昇據報後，親率刑事股長蔣上佩，股員張魁棟，警員孫覺民，馳赴現塲詳查，結果毫無綫索可尋，將三只空皮箱之布袋檢視，亦無破綻。惟以本案涉嫌最重者，係視任解款折封之曹秋亭及司機邱友祥，指揮裝箱之鄭源貴，裝箱工友儲映秋，當塲將四人帶局訊問。據曹秋亭供云，上午七時五十五分確在胡處取得三隻皮箱，僱乘泰山汽車行汽車載往建國西路新昇里九號家內，卽拆封擬將儲藏之美金取出，轉送銀行，不料打開三皮箱後，卽發覺僅存美金一千六百四十元，卽携三皮箱復乘原車遄返永安堂，交與胡為之檢點，幷無行竊等情。據司機供云：在弄口停頓廿五分鐘，瞥見曹仍携原箱外出，返歸永安堂，沿途並未下車等情。</p>
<p>證明爲人誠實</p>
<p>據代經理鄭源貴供：係胡之至戚。當時胡在旁，亦極力陳述鄭為人誠實，兼之就職未久，在滬並無親友，認為決不致行竊。至裝箱工人儲映秋，則在裝箱時監視者甚多當亦不致行竊云云。至此，曹之嫌疑似較重大，遂經員警至曹秋亭及儲映秋家查詢，悉與所供符合。時警局方面獲悉，鄭曾向經濟大隊密吿胡有私藏金鈔嫌疑，其用意顯在企圖使經濟大隊將胡傳案偵訊，不敢直說美鈔之正確數目，以掩護竊盜行為。</p>
<p>終於供出實情</p>
<p>蔣股長乃親自嚴詢，鄭不能隱瞞，始和盤托出，供認廿二日午夜十二時，協助工人儲映秋裝箱完畢後，携該兩皮箱至胡之臥室，其時胡已熱睡，潛將二皮箱携至本人臥室中，乘漿糊尙未乾燥時，將所貼之封條拉開，取出布袋，將其中之美金如數竊去。又以同法將第二隻開啓，竊出美鈔，僅留一部份計一千六百四十元在箱內，事畢，仍將該箱置放胡之臥室。廿三日晨七時，將所竊之美金，分包於牛皮紙二包中，餘留少數，儲藏於保險箱中。嗣後並書家信一通，內附竊得之美票二百五十元（五十元一張者），寄交其母。廿四日上午十時，因該皮箱內缺少美金為曹秋亭所察破，為避免事洩計，將所竊之美金如數偽裝於入卦丹包內，安放於貨房中不諱。並矢口否認有同黨參與等情。</p>
<p>尚缺一百餘元</p>
<p>據供後，由承辦員押同鄭犯按址前往吊出原贓，計美金三萬六千九百廿五元，連同剩餘箱中之一千六百四于元，及匯出之二百五十元，總數為三萬八千八百十五元，核與被竊前總數三萬九千元尙短少一百八十五元，則未查出。當以該鄭源貴犯竊盜罪，連同證物布袋三只，移送地檢處。至吊獲原贓美金三萬六千九百廿五元，雖然據查尙無經營黑市逃避黃金之嫌，警局為鄭重計，將送交中央銀行掉換金圓劵發還被害人胡為之具領。</p>

<p>〔本報訊」本市茂名南路紡建公司第一門市部，自代售行政院物資供應局呢絨嗶嘰以來，因定價低廉，市民往購者擁擠空前，公司方面為維持秩序計，每天於開始發售前先發號牌，憑牌依次購料一塊，計六碼，每日以供應六百人為限，規定公敎人員二百號，市民四百號，並為便利公敎人員起見，凡持有證件者先行發號脾。茲悉：該公司發售迄今，擁擠情形，日益嚴重，市民列隊前往領取號牌者，每日在千人以上，又因惟恐落後，竟有於前一日傍晚六時起，卽往紡建公司門口排隊，如是須鵠候十二小時以上，至翌日十時領得號牌後，始行進內購料，雖在細雨濛濛之時，若輩多隨身携帶雨傘麵包，前往排隊者乃不乏人，其擠軋程度，較者日購米情况，有過之而無不及。惟因利之所在，「黃牛」乃大肆活動，據聞若輩亂於黎明人靜時，結隊將排隊之市民衝散，因是後來居上，常能優先領得號牌，而佇立竟夜之市民反無法購料。</p>
<p>至少可供半年銷售</p>
<p>記者昨曾往訪該公司經理胡頌翰，據談：公司倉庫中存貨充足，僅就目前存貨言，至少可供應半年以上，故市民不必爭先恐後，惟公司方面所憂慮者，乃「黃牛」出現後，正當市民恐難以享受權利，一切利益盡入「黃牛」之手。為防範計，該公司除請戡建大隊經常維持秩序外，現正擬向當局建議一澈底根絕辦法，卽市民均須憑身份證購料，購至相當標準時，於身份證上加蓋圖記，本季中卽不得再買。胡經理稱：購買標準尺度及詳細辦法，公司方面正加擬訂中，如上項辦法一經實施，則「黃牛」必將絕跡，市民之利益可均等，擁擠情形亦可好轉。</p>

<p>本市總工會理事長水祥雲，頃對勤儉建國運動發表意見稱：勤儉建國運動係根據新生活運動及國民經濟建設運動之進一步行動，其本質俱為改革社會。渠認為全國同胞均有此種需要，以上海社會而言，奢侈浪費靡爛之生活，充滿全市，亟應予以　進，故勤儉建國運動實為新道德運動，以「動勞」來復興國家。水氏謂：動儉節約應着重於都市，目前都市人民之消費實已與生產脫節，故節約自應自京·滬·穗·漢·平·津大都市首先實行，然後普及全國。同時必需由上而下，更應注重達官縣宦豪富階級之是否實踐，因吾國貧民之事受在水準以下，已至節無可節之境地。渠幷以英國為例，英國之節約至為澈底，上至王族，下至貧民，均一體遵行，此種上下同甘苦之精神，實堪欽佩·至配給制度亦極平等，任何人同等待遇，我人更應師法。故希望達官顯宦豪富　級，不要再只喊口號，應上行下效始能推動。水氏幷提出五點具體意見：（一）人，首應節省人力，無論機關公司個人，均應儘量節省。（二）事，應减少無謂之應酬，會議及若干公文之轉折，對婚喪喜慶尤應節約。（三）物，無論機關工廠應使物盡其用，並節約浪費，關於奢侈裝飾品更應摒絕。（四）時，應節約時間，同時更需遵守時間和把握時間。（五）地，應盡其用，幷提出「不留餘地」之口號。水氏認為値此戡亂建國期中，一面節約，一面更應努力生產。最後水氏强調經濟民主化，生活合理化之眞諦，政府應獎勵各界人士一律勞動，以增加生產，凡勞動者人人有飯吃，使寄生虫及不勞而獲者轉而參加勞働，則社會不平現象，當可消滅，而普遍提高我國人民之生活水準</p>

<p>目八月十九日新經濟方案頒行以來，市塲交易自八月廿三日算起，狀至上週末止，恰為一個月零三天。在這一個多月當中，上海因由蔣經國氏負責督導新方案的施行　，措施認眞而嚴明，所以上海成績也最好，交易均能遵守法令，限價始終屹立不動。傳華南方面曾有派員來滬，研究將氏「成功秘訣」之語。</p>
<p>我們於滬市管制物價成功，欣幸之餘，對於當前市塲的狀况，不能不作進一步的探討。因為上海在全國經濟中所佔的重要性太大，所以這一次新方案實施後，當局管制的重點，也特別着重於上海，認為控制上海可收平抑全國物價之效，到目前為止，滬市總算守住八一九的物價了。可是外埠管制的情形，則不儘理想，形成滬市的物價，站在一糧絕緣而偏低的狀况中，所以雖在嚴刑悛法之下，滬市物資仍時有蠢蠢欲動，向外埠逃避的企圖，此其一。因為滬市物價的偏低，長此以往，外埠的原料和土產，對於滬市將有畏縮不前的現象發生，此其二。新方案施行後，游資迄未能有效的吸收，據估計目前滬市游資　積約達三億元左右，這是以前法幣時代所遠不及的一個龐大數字，同時滬市暗息低見六分，而頭寸尙不易拆出，西南各埠暗息，傳仍有高達二角以上者，此其三。綜合前述的因素，我們覺得滬市物價的管制，亟應認淸癥結的所在，於百尺竽頭，還要另外轉個方向，才能確保新方案百分之百的成功。</p>
<p>物價走勢穩中見俏</p>
<p>上週商品市塲的走勢，由於游資泛濫，去路活躍，物價頗有上升的趨勢，但因懾於當局的管制，自不敢違反限價，不過升達漲限者，則所見紛紛，不勝枚舉。</p>

<p>日用品如肥皂，火柴，香烟等，走勢較上週起伏互見，週末固本皂站廿五元六角，美麗火柴站一百一十七元，香烟高檔貨仍不多見，餘多屹立漲限。</p>
<p>經管努力迭施新猷</p>
<p>上周在經濟督導員辦公處的主持下，擬訂的新措施大約有：（一）督導員辦公處為明瞭本市工廠之原料及必需品之實際數量起見，決定自廿五日起至三十日止，開始辦理全市物資總登記，限令於此五日內完成一切登記手續。登記辦法：先由市社會局將登記表格，分發全市三百餘同業公會，由各業公會分發各商店，行號，工廠，倉庫，自行塡具實數。表格上分貨名，單位，數量，每月之銷售量·限於二十七日前，交各業同業公會，由各業公會於廿八日交社會局轉督導員辦公處查核。</p>
<p>必需品之登記，先以米，麵，粉，紗，布，紙，食油，及工業原料為限，並規定調查後，各商號仍須依限價零售，供應市塲，登記完成後實施全面總檢查，發動五千人，定下週起，開始實行倉庫總檢查，如查出未登記之貨物與原料，皆予充公，貨主依法嚴辦。</p>
<p>（二）原則開於自備外匯，所有准許進口者，以工業原料必需品及機械為限。</p>
<p>（三）原則決定上海工業品如有餘裕時，得將餘裕之物品運往外埠，以不影響本市物價為原則。運出辦法，由產銷兩地同業公會取得聯絡，以防制强銷，囤積，操縱等非法行為，如查有違反上項規定者，決嚴予懲處。</p>
<p>（四）金銀美鈔兌換限期，決定為本月底，決不展期，淪期查出，依法嚴辦。</p>
<p>國營股票改進銷售</p>
<p>國營事業股票發售以來，銷路清淡，上週益見寥落，據悉國行正謀打開銷路，已決定三項辦法：（一）國營事業各單位之資產負債，趕速造報，分別印發，以便投齊人之選擇。</p>
<p>（二）保證投資人之利益，提高股息。（三）改訂股息支付辦法，以增加投齊人之興趣，過去一年付息一次，現擬改分三個月付息。（四）增加發售地區，分期普及各大都市，關於恢復證交專拍國營事業之股票，當局已着手研討辦法中。又台灣方面亦已洽妥，日內卽開始發售，漢口，重慶等處，亦在籌劃之中</p>
<p>短期庫券恢復應市</p>
<p>短期國為券於週四起，在上海先由中央銀行恢復發售。劵面分金圓五十元，一百元，五百元，一千元，五千元，五種，扣足一個月到期，照面折扣發行，利患另加按月息一分五厘許算折扣逐日掛牌，第一日牌價按九八·五發售，自發售日至上週末之三日間，共售出三千餘萬元，當此淤資苦無出路之時，國庫券應運恢復問世，定期一月，亦不過長，適合市塲需要，故銷路頗有希望，</p>
<h3 id="c83">貨幣　金融　游資泛濫亟待疏導 <a href="#c83" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e83" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">83</a></h3>
<p>上週本市金融市塲，一方面是頭寸的供源絕對旺盛，但另一方面，却是資金需求的極度衰落，於是銀根的鬆濫，已呈現空前嚴重的局面。自從幣制改革以後，本市淤資，始終來源多而出路少，日積月累，數額益見龐大，當局原擬出售國營事業股票，作為疏導游資的方法之一，但不過短短數天，人民的吸胃就像早達到了飽和的程度，其售出的總額亦不及原定發行順的百分之一，於是上週週四起，當局巳發行履庫劵以為補教，較之出售國營事業股票，頗　秀色</p>
<p>據估計，　積於本市的游資，總額已達四億元左右，而其間如國家行局最近連續十幾天的差出，卽快達三千萬元之譜。游資的出路是必須有保陣的，沒有保障，游資最多祗能停留在銀行裏，待機蠢動。但可以斷言的，淤資必然要找尋出路，假如不是走向正當而與生產事業有關的路，那末便會走上不正當而與生產事業無關的路，暫時的穩靜禾必是好現像，因為過一段時間，也許听起的作用更劇烈，所以防患於朱然，實在巳是刻不容緩的事了！</p>
<p>頭寸壅積暗息下跌</p>
<p>上週市塲暗息，始終在低檔盤旋，大致做六分至七分半之間，其　低限已跌入過五以前銀錢業六分六區的欠息掛牌以內，這也是以前所少見的。再如本市若千行莊星期存款的月息，不但遞减至三分以下，而且行莊對是項存款已不表興趣，於此不難看出市塲頭寸雍積之一般。但有一現象頗堪注意者，乃市間對一個月或三個月的較長期借款，反有殷切之需求，其利率竟高至二角以上，如無特殊原因，則可解釋為一般人民對經濟市塲的心理狀態，並不穩定的反應。</p>
<p>上週貨帮貼息，大致坐定日拆二元，合月息亦不過六分。</p>
<p>行局增出洋商增進</p>
<p>上週國家行局交換結果，以收購物資等付款，續吿鉅額差出，自週一至週末，無日無出，總額共達一千一百一十五萬八千七百七十九元，較前週同期內尙增出一百七十五萬九千餘元。</p>
<p>洋商銀行交　結果，自週一至週五，計共差進四百零八萬八千七百八十七元，較前週同期內猶增進一百八十五萬二千一百餘元</p>
<p>商業行莊，頭寸充斥異常，多單者比比皆是，同業拆放毫未做開，淤資出路全無，金融界之苦悶，可謂與日俱增。上週六十號以後行莊交換結果，竟全面差進，自週一至週五，差進總額達四百八十二萬元之鉅，其間卽扣除五夭內合灣銀行八萬元之差進，商業行莊間接交換之差進仍達四百七十多萬三元之讀，業內頭寸之　積，可以槪見。</p>
<p>內匯有跌港市有升</p>
<p>上週商業行莊內匯行情，趨勢續降，穗匯匯水未變，自週一至週五均為廿四元，厦匯匯水自前週週末之廿四元，减為上週週一之二十元後，亦迄無變動。渝匯匯水，遞見下降，前週週末為二十元，上週週一降至十六元，週二起再落為十二元，週五則再跌至十元之低水準。漢匯匯水亦續見下落，週一為十六元，週二起卽為十二元，　五亦再降至十元。津匯匯水前週末為十元，上週下跌並穩定於五元之水準。</p>
<p>外匯行市，如香港黃金每華兩週一為二百九十六元五角，嗣後續見上升，至週四價二百九十八五元一角一，週二跌落二分，週三週四，則回升至五元一角八分。香港申匯則仍鉀行情，官價外匯率亦同前週。</p>

<h3 id="c93">買些什麽菜呢？ <a href="#c93" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e93" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">93</a></h3>
<p>— 贊影</p>
<p>近年來，小菜塲總是利市百倍的；因此，小菜商販們的面孔，一直是難看的，一語不合，便是：「不要拉倒！」</p>
<p>改幣前，他們隨心所欲的漲價，而且「看人討價」，「新做人家」的主婦，吃虧最甚，跟他吵吧，沒那麽大氣力，而且他會半議諷半豆腐」的給你無趣；所以門檻較精，經騐較多的主婦和娘姨，大都學會：「餽一把，抓一把，臨走撈一把」的功夫；蓋非窮兇極惡，用盡氣力，決不足以應付。</p>
<p>現在則更變本加屬了。一早六七點鐘就得上菜塲，但已是人山人海，用力擠進人潮，看準空隙，還得用金嗓子：「謝謝愈給我稱一斤肉！」然而身為「捉刀人」的肉販，大都有耳疾，隨你高喊狂呌，往往會充耳不聞。一再請求後，給你一斤「雜牌肉」，儘管骨多，皮厚，肉胖，不准選擇，要不然，他會怒目而視，切齒而駡；客氣一點的：「老板娘，你買得到肉，已經滿好了！哼！限價貨還要揀瘦嫌胖！」</p>
<p>不但此也，卽斤兩也不由你作王，聽吧：「半斤不賣，起碼一斤·要不要？」</p>
<p>馴如羔羊，聽受宰割地由他稱好肉，你必須把幾元幾角幾分，計算妥貼，如數呈繳，因為那「捉刀人」已高聲關照過：「錢拿好在手裘，沒有零錢找啦！」</p>
<p>買肉的人最多，因為蔬菜不比肉便宜多少，而且加上了油，也就等於肉價，但是肉販的一臉橫肉，聲色俱厲，眞呌人難受。不過話說回來，他們的面孔是兩副的，如果你肯出「黑價」，或者是館子裏大量的買，他便會笑容可掬地：「一會兒替你送來！」—這便是人造肉荒的由來。</p>
<p>至於遲一步上菜市，那些肉攤于早已「十處九空」，另一架子上剩下半只豬頭，一條筋肉，寂寞地點綴菜市，魚桶中也以剩下混水了！魚板上也只剩下幾堆貓魚了！轉身去買蛋吧，但蛋攤上只有鴨蛋，說是鷄蛋照限價沒有好處，你要吃鷄蛋除非送到府上（當然，不照限價），但是少不送；於是，默默地挑了幾個鴨蛋往籃子裏放，算是一天的菜單，已交了卷。</p>
<p>以前，豬肉買不到，牛肉還有得買，這兩天連牛肉也是遲一點便都平就搶購一空。蔬菜部也儘多的空筐子，各種蔬菜的限價實際並不比原來價格低，但是菜却愈來愈少，也沒有揀挑的餘地。豆腐乾愈做愈小，你嫌小嗎？回答是乾脆的：「不要拉倒！」</p>
<p>買菜！買菜！買些什麽菜呢！</p>

<p>我們都知道鴿子能從遠地飛回家去，却不知野鹿也着實不願遠離本土。</p>
<p>不久以前，有一批蘇格蘭種的鹿運到了遙遠的新西蘭。到達了沒有多少時候，忽然有幾隻乘隙逃走，不知所往。過了幾天，才發現牠們竟在波濤汹湧的海洋中，正在勇猛地向家鄉游去。而牠們事實上已離家一萬三千英哩，途中還須經過雲水浩　的太平洋和大西洋呢！</p>

<p>— 元義</p>
<p>商業發達，廣吿事業當然也要發達，以前有詩人對這個時代之廣吿氣息太濃而太息人心漸壞，却不知這一「壤」實在於瓦特發明蒸汽機的時候已經開始。</p>
<p>廣吿正如一切事物一樣，也在天天進步。我們看美國鬧市天空的五花八門的空中廣吿，固然已震驚於廣吿技巧之日新月異，但是，我以為尤其値得注意的，却是美國一般書報刊物上的廣吿，在根本上處理的原則便已和以前頗有不同。這一方面，也許有可以供我們參考的地方。</p>
<p>第一·美國廣吿在减少海闊天空的「野話」，而多多少少注重貨物本身的實質。他們固然注重「隱惡揚善」，但已漸漸减少「無中生有」的成分。如日常用品的廣吿中常見一個橢圓小印，上寫「茲經家事雜誌保證，如廣吿所言不確，必可退貨還洋或掉換」，這無疑能够吸引許多厭見「野話」式廣吿的顧客。而若干醫療用具的廣吿中也常有「經美國醫師公會物理治療會認可」的盾形標記，這當然也以增强病家的信心。我國成藥廣吿如此之多，我以為這後一項尤其値得仿行·</p>
<p>第二·廣吿本身之製作大有進步。他們處處注意每一種刊物的特有讀者羣，務求趣味適合，所以整個刊物的風格也不會因廣吿文字之惡劣而受不良影響。</p>
<p>第三·畫多字少。道也是一種進步。有時字多畫少，則往往是用輕鬆有致的筆調介紹一種大家所並不討厭的常識（如保險公司廣吿談血壓高的徵象及中風之預防，電話公司解釋打電話的手續……等）。</p>
<p>美國征兵也登廣告，而且製作極精，足見政府對此之重視。我國廣吿商近年已有不少進步，但如欲迎上時代走去，似乎還應當繼續多多努力罷？</p>

<h3 id="c99">「關亡」在美國 <a href="#c99" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e99" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">99</a></h3>
<p>— 烟波</p>
<p>美國支加哥市有一個以善於「關亡」著名的「靈魂學家」派克，平日門庭若市，生意興吒。一天，來了一個眼睛哭得紅紅的婦人，穿了一件新買的她喪服，要求克　　　，讓她和她去世不久的丈夫談幾句話</p>
<p>派克閉上了眼睛，嘴裏呻吟了半天，說：「我看見了一個男人。對，他正是你的丈夫。他說他很快樂，就是捨不下你。他要去了。他呌你不必悲哀，他說，如果你想念他，祗要到我這裏來關亡好了。對不起，關亡費一元。」</p>
<p>那個女人哭起來了。她抽抽噎噎的說：「怎麽他已經去了呢？我還有話說呀！他留下來的三千塊錢怎樣處置呢？」</p>
<p>「靈魂學家」的面部表情馬上緊張起來。「讓找來試一試看，你不要急。」</p>
<p>他又閉上了眼睛，如痴如醉了一回，說：「我又找到你的丈夫了。他說這筆錢是給你做生意的。他呌你投資到—」</p>
<p>他好像非常痛苦，臉上的肌肉都痙攣地抖動着。他說：</p>
<p>「你的丈夫呌你投資到一家韋考克斯運輸公司裏去，在梅木街一千一百五十九號，他說這家公司財運旺盛，今年存一千元進去，兩年之內就可以賺到五千多塊錢。</p>
<p>那個女人的眼淚又流了下來，她感激地說：「派克先生，我不知道怎樣才能報答你。」</p>
<p>梅木街一千一百五十九號門牌確有韋　克斯其人，他早已從派克處知道接到了一筆好生意，所以那個女客到時，他就欣然編盡招待之能事，而那個女客也竟然唯韋考克斯之言是從，做起運輸生意來了。</p>
<p>然而，派克和韋考克斯樂極生悲，突然那個女客控吿他們勾串詐財，證據確鑿，這兩人無詞抵賴，祗好　鐺入獄—</p>
<p>這位女客的眞名字是羅絲，麥根堡，她根本尙未結婚，那裏來的什麼新近去世的丈夫！二十年來，這位麥根堡小姐就專門對那些靠祖宗亡人混飯吃的騙子們作戰。她說，紐約·支加哥·落山磯那些大都市中，每年每地送給這些騙子們的錢，至少在一百萬美元以上，若以全國而論，那麽每年在這方面的費用恐怕就出了一億美元大關了。</p>
<p>她一向和法院或警察當局合作，常常化裝為農婦，女傭，闊太太，尤以寡婦為多，因為她說寡婦是最容易上那些‘騙子的當的。</p>
<p>有一次，一位富翁的太太把麥根保小姐請了去，原來那位當翁極其迷信，非常相信一位「靈魂學家」的話。那位「靈魂學家」說他財氣大好，呌他到賭台上在輪盤賭「五號」處下注，必可大嬴。那位富翁心花怒放，連忙照辦！結果却輸掉了八千塊錢！</p>
<p>但是那位富翁居然對那位「靈魂學家」還是深信不疑，又去找他了。那們時候，麥根堡帶了一個助手，已經趕到，不過沒有出面。</p>
<p>富翁又帶了三千塊錢到賭　去，然而麥根堡却已經偷聽了那位「靈魂學家」打給賭台老板的電話！而且，她把這兩個人的說話灌成了唱片！</p>
<p>麥根堡和富翁的太太在賭塲的休息室中找到了那位富翁，把唱片開給他聽。但聽那「靈魂學家」說道：「這傢伙竟會得一點也不疑心，虧他居然還會得做生意！我看他簡直像是一個小孩子，什麼都不懂，也許比小孩子還要笨一點！」</p>
<p>富翁惱羞交併，滿面通紅，承認是受了騙，但是他絕對不肯控吿這兩個騙子。他呌道：「什麽話！難道呌我到法庭上去聽他們開這一張唱片嗎？豈不要呌我成為全市的笑柄！」</p>
<p>從來沒有一個眞實不欺的鬼對那些「關亡」的人們說：「當心，麥根堡來搗亂了。」因之，麥根堡至今還沒有遭逢到失敗。</p>

<p>[Report from Nanjing by Our Newspaper on the 26th] The Capital Special Criminal Court recently sentenced Shen Bingquan, a bandit spy uncovered in Shenyang, to life imprisonment. Shen, also known as Shen Jun, was from Haiyan, Zhejiang. In 1939, while studying at Fudan University in Chongqing, he was introduced to the bandit party by his classmate Qi Luying. In 1941, he and his fiancée Wu Shulan went to Yan'an and entered the Shaanxi Northern Public School. He was trained in the Urban Training Class hosted by Kang Sheng, the bandit party's special agent in charge, and served as an economics instructor in the bandit party school training class. Then was sent to Xi'an to work, once sneaked into the International News Agency led by Hu Zongnan, and later transferred to the Xi'an Telecommunications Bureau. In 1946, after flying to Beiping, he went to Shenyang and joined the Northeast Telecommunications Bureau. In Shenyang, he organized the Northeast News Agency and purchased three transceivers to communicate with the bandits. He was uncovered by the National Defense Ministry's Bureau of Investigation and Statistics, arrested and brought to Nanjing, and transferred to the Special Criminal Court for trial. The court, considering that the evidence of the defendant's crime was conclusive, sentenced him to life imprisonment according to the law.</p>

<p>[Report from Nanjing on the 26th] During the three-month period after banks deposit cash in the Central Bank after capital increases, according to Article 5 of the "Measures for Adjusting the Capital of Commercial Banks," it can still be used with the approval of the Ministry of Finance for legitimate purposes. The management aspect has negotiated the method of use, and a preliminary decision has been made. The principle is still to hope that it will not be used, but if necessary, it can only be used in the following three ways: (1) For purchasing short-term treasury bills or government bonds, it can be used in full, but it has not yet been decided whether it will be permitted to be used once a month for three months with short-term treasury bills being issued monthly. (2) For productive enterprises, one-quarter of the deposited cash may be withdrawn. (3) When funds are tight, it can be used for emergency needs, but in case of special urgency and there is no time to report to the Ministry of Finance for approval, it can be reported to the local Financial Administration for approval, and then reported to the Ministry of Finance for record. The above method is currently being reviewed by the Ministry of Finance, and will be announced very soon after approval.</p>

<p>[Report from Nanjing by the Central News Agency on the 26th] Wu Manyou, the "Labor Hero" who defected from the Communist bandits, and Yang Jingqu, the "Vice Chairman of the Henan-Hubei-Anhui Border Region," began broadcasting on the National Defense Ministry's Political Warfare Bureau's military radio station on the 26th. They will continue to broadcast on the 27th and 28th at 1:25 PM and 8:20 PM each day. The long wave is 416.6 meters, with a frequency of 720 kilohertz. The short wave is 24.6 meters, with a frequency of 12200 kilohertz. The broadcasts are also being jointly relayed by the Central, Air Force, Capital, Yishi, Jinling, Jianye, and Youth radio stations in this city, as well as military branch stations in Hankou, Xi'an, Beiping, Guangzhou, and Shenyang. The original text of their broadcasts is as follows:</p>
<p>Full text of Wu Manyou's broadcast</p>
<p>Dear elders, brothers, and sisters, my name is Wu Manyou. I am 55 years old and from Wu Jia Zao Yuan in Yan'an, northern Shaanxi. In order to utilize me, the Communist bandits selected me as a labor hero of the border region. I have served as the vice chairman of the Yan'an County Council, the principal of the Farmers' University, the director of the Red Army Dependents Support Office, and the chief of the Civil Affairs Department of the Second General Team, as well as the captain of the stretcher team. Last year, the National Army overcame Yan'an, and I was forced to join the army. This April, I was captured by the National Army while fighting in 董東 with Peng Dehuai's troops. I thought I would surely die. Unexpectedly, not only did I not die, but I also enjoyed the government's love and preferential treatment everywhere. My speech, actions, and daily life are all very free. In the six months I have been with the government, my body has gained eight or nine pounds. This is worthy of consolation to those in the bandit area who care about me.</p>
<p>I am an illiterate farmer. Mao Zedong and his bandits used sweet words to coax me into becoming a labor hero, a vice chairman, and a university principal. In reality, they only valued my ability to engage in production. They thought I was honest and could be deceived, so they used some nice-sounding titles to elevate me, but in essence, they wanted me and farmers like me to work ourselves to death to solve the food shortage for their troops and agencies. From 1938 to 1946, my family paid more than two hundred ancestors in public grain. All I got was a hypocritical labor hero title and an empty stomach. Mao Zedong's ability to deceive people is truly enough 傎.</p>
<p>Since arriving in the government area, I have passed through Xi'an and Nanjing. I have walked through cities and villages. What I have seen and heard, compared to northern Shaanxi, is truly the difference between heaven and hell. The people in the government area can speak and act freely. The taxes they pay are very light, unlike the Communist bandits who extract arbitrarily and endlessly. Even conscription is carried out according to reasonable procedures, unlike the Communist bandits who use struggle and threats to grab everyone, regardless of age or gender. In short, the lives and property of the people in the government area are fully guaranteed. Therefore, I understand that Mao Zedong's criticism of the government is entirely out of malicious propaganda and slander.</p>
<p>Now that the government has implemented currency reform, all prices are very stable. Therefore, people who farm and do business feel that there are ways and hope. Everyone is working hard on their own farming and production with the help of the government. Everyone is living a stable life with sufficient food and clothing. So I want to advise my compatriots in the bandit area: Don't be deceived by the Communist bandits anymore. Unite quickly and implement non-cooperation with the bandits. As long as we, the people, are not used by them, the Communist bandit rebellion will not succeed. The government can then implement comprehensive construction, and we can have a life of peace and happiness. (Continued on page 2)</p>

<h3 id="e21">Editorial: The Soviet Union's New Attitude Toward the Japanese Question <a href="#e21" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c21" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">21</a></h3>
<p>The Soviet Union's attitude toward the Japanese question has recently undergone a new shift. Regarding the conclusion of a Japanese peace treaty, the Soviet Union advocates convening a peace conference. Regarding the limits of Japan's industrial level, Soviet Ambassador to the United States, Pan Youxin, presented a new proposal at the Far Eastern Commission on the 23rd, advocating that Japan's industry should develop into peacetime industry, but that the control of this industrial recovery should be carried out by countries most concerned with preventing new Japanese aggression. He also said that giving Japan several years of unrestricted revitalization of its industry under the control of various powers, in order to prevent Japan from building new military institutions, would not be a cause for concern in itself. After Pan Youxin's proposal was announced, U.S. officials felt deeply surprised, and Japanese political circles felt even more excited. If this proposal is sincere and does not carry any smokescreen effect, it is indeed a noteworthy matter for the improvement of U.S.-Soviet Far East relations and the clarification of the Japanese question.</p>
<p>More than three years have passed since Japan's defeat and surrender, and not only has a peace treaty with Japan not been concluded, but even the procedural issues of the preparatory meeting for the peace conference have yet to be resolved due to disputes among the nations. Due to the opposition between the U.S. and the Soviet Union, the Far Eastern Commission has lost its luster; due to the divergence of opinions among the control authorities, meetings of the Tokyo Control Council for Japan often end unhappily in a short period of time. The Soviet Union is dissatisfied with the United States' unilateral control of Japan's policies, but does not put forward active and constructive methods to improve the situation. The United States ignores the intervention of allied countries and the Far Eastern Commission, and actively and unilaterally supports Japan, repeatedly publishing reports to raise Japan's industrial level, stimulating the national sentiments of Far Eastern countries. If this unreasonable and irregular phenomenon continues to develop, the future of U.S.-Soviet relations is worrying, and the fear of Far Eastern countries about new Japanese aggression is even more worrying. Standing from China's position, we really do not want this deteriorating situation to continue to develop. We would like to see the harmony of the U.S. and the Soviet Union, the opening up of the predicament of the Japanese question, and even more so, a peaceful and democratic Japan realized under the supervision and control of a peace treaty, thereby restoring friendly relations between China and Japan. Based on this viewpoint, in addition to focusing our attention on the Soviet Union's change of attitude, we also hope that wise politicians will quickly find a way to break the deadlock and not use this as a performance of the Cold War.</p>
<p>The biggest problems of the contradictions and opposition between the U.S. and the Soviet Union in the Far East are the problems of Korea and Japan. The Korean problem appears to be deadlocked on the surface, but in fact, as long as the U.S. and the Soviet Union change their minds, the Korean problem can be resolved peacefully and unified. The Japanese problem is more complicated, and the only way to solve it is to convene a Japanese peace conference and conclude a Japanese peace treaty. The dispute over the procedure of the peace conference is a dispute for advantage. If the opinions on the content of the treaty are consistent, the holding of veto power is a secondary issue. The key to the content of the peace treaty lies in the economy, and the core economic issue is the determination of Japan's industrial level, which is related to both the compensation issue and Japan's political system and people's livelihood. In recent years, the Soviet Union's attitude has been to oppose Japan's high industrial level and to criticize Japan's economic recovery. It has given ruthless refutation to the "Strike Report" and the "Johnston Plan." In fact, the United States has not yet submitted these two plans to the Far Eastern Commission as official documents, and the countries of the Far Eastern Commission still have a shortcut to compromise with the United States. Mr. Pan Youxin's proposal has several points worth noting: first, he does not oppose Japan's high industrial level, but only limits it to peacetime industry; second, he does not oppose Japan's economic recovery, but it should be implemented under the control of various countries; third, he emphasizes compensation and satisfies the demands of countries that have suffered aggression; finally, he declares that the Soviet government has no reason to limit Japan's future industry. Mr. Pan is a young and cautious Soviet diplomat who is well aware of the Far Eastern situation. His words represent the Soviet government, and we are unwilling to make a hasty judgment as to whether his new proposal is valued by the U.S. government. However, the change in the Soviet Union's attitude toward the Japanese question is a new fact. Standing from China's position, we are interested in the Soviet Union's new attitude. Therefore, we await the reaction of the Far Eastern Commission to the Soviet Union's new proposal, in order to seek a shortcut to compromise.</p>
<p>Regarding the question of determining Japan's industrial level, we theoretically do not approve of the "Strike Report" and the "Johnston Plan." We believe that the principle of determining Japan's industry at the current stage is the case of the "Determination of Peaceful Needs of Japan" passed by the Far Eastern Commission on January 23, 1947, in which representatives of all member countries raised their hands in favor and no one raised any objections. Mr. Pan Youxin's new proposal may be based on this case, which shows that the Soviet Union's opinion lies in promoting the completion of a peace treaty with Japan. Our country is in favor of this case, and the U.S. government has never proposed an amendment to this case, so this case exists in law. Since the member countries of the Far Eastern Commission have no major discrepancies on the principles of Japan's industrial level, in terms of the situation, it should be the time to convene a Japanese peace conference. Therefore, we re-propose the advocacy, hoping that the U.S. and the Soviet Union will further coordinate, quickly convene a peace conference, and conclude a Japanese peace treaty, so as to make a clear solution to the uncertain Japanese problem.</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, San Francisco, 25th] Since Ms. Liang Biguo (transliteration), aged 32, committed suicide in the immigration detention center here on the 21st of this month, this question has paid great attention to our country's immigration issues in the past three days. The first reaction is that the American Civil Liberties Union of Northern California issued a statement on the 22nd, calling for the closure of the overcrowded immigration detention center on Sansome Street here, and also suggesting two concrete ways to improve the immigration entry procedures: (1) Immigration detention should not exceed one month; (2) The right of foreigners to enter the United States should be determined before they board the ship to come to the United States. In addition, the San Francisco Chronicle has published three special articles on immigration issues, respectively examining: (1) the situation of immigration detention centers, (2) the efforts of Immigration Director Wilkinson here on immigration matters, and (3) why some immigrants have been detained for several months! According to the materials provided by Director Wilkinson, the newspaper stated that no fewer than thousands of overseas Chinese who arrived in the United States and obtained entry without difficulty. However, from September 1946 to April of this year, a total of 383 Chinese immigrants were detained. Among them, 319 were granted entry after the second hearing of the Inquiry Committee, and another 574 were granted entry after the Committee's retrial. During this period, only 66 people were ordered to be deported, but only 25 of them actually returned to China as ordered, while the rest remained in the United States, attempting to go through legal entry procedures.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 26th] News from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs: Regarding the fact that overseas Chinese are often detained by the San Francisco Immigration Bureau due to procedural issues when going to the United States, the Ministry has repeatedly telegraphed our embassies and consulates in the United States to negotiate improvements. The U.S. government recently sent the Director-General and Deputy Director-General of the Immigration Bureau, together with the Director of the Immigration Group of the Senate, to San Francisco to investigate and discuss improvement measures. As a result of the contact with our Consulate General in San Francisco, the following improvement measures have been drafted: (1) Increase the number of immigration examiners to clear backlog cases. (2) Accelerate the examination procedures as much as possible. (3) If the re-approval conditions cannot be determined after the preliminary examination, the person concerned may post a guarantee of 500 to 1,000 yuan to be released first. (4) The immigration detention center can only accommodate more than 300 people, and the old site of the Seamen's Union outside San Francisco should be used immediately.</p>

<h3 id="e44">Wu Manyou and Yang Jingqu Broadcast to Expose the Communist Bandits' Tricks <a href="#e44" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c44" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">44</a></h3>
<p>Full Text of Yang Jingqu's Broadcast Speech</p>
<p>Elders, brothers, and sisters across the country, my surname is Yang, and my name is Jingqu. I joined the Communist New Fourth Army Yu-E-Wan Border Region Li Xiannian's unit in August 1940. I served as the Deputy Chairman of the Border Region Government, Brigade Commander, Detachment Commander, and Commander of the Third Military Sub-district. I was in the bandit area for five years and eleven months before leaving the Communists in July 1945.</p>
<p>During these six years, I learned about everything about the Communists. Now let me give a brief report so that my compatriots across the country can recognize the true face of the Communists.</p>
<p>(Continued from the first page)</p>
<p>First of all, I want to explain that the Communist Party has no motherland. Their slogan is world revolution. They are commanded by the Communist International (that is, the Soviet Union). The Communist International is above everything else, that is to say, they are all for the Communist International, for the Soviet Union. If something happens that is beneficial to the Soviet Union but detrimental to the motherland, they will undoubtedly sacrifice the motherland. Judging from the CCP's attitude toward the Northeast issue and from the Soviet Union's refusal to allow China to participate in the foreign ministers' meeting on the German peace treaty, their words and actions are completely in line with the Soviet Union and betray the motherland. This proves that if the Chinese Communist Party succeeds, China will become a vassal state of the Soviet Union and will no longer be China.</p>
<p>The Communist Party advocates proletarian revolution, but what the Chinese Communist Party has created is a rogue dictatorship. They not only use violence to confiscate the property of the middle class and carry out cruel liquidation struggles, but also confiscate the grain that farmers have earned through labor in the name of "supporting the front line and donating grain." After strict struggles and liquidation, no one runs the factories, and the workers have no way out. They have all become prisoners of the Communists. The Communists force workers to join the army as cannon fodder or force workers to pay for the work they can afford. However, the Communists do not care about the welfare and health of the workers at all. Therefore, although the Communists shout for the peasant and worker revolution and the proletarian dictatorship, in reality, the peasants are cattle and horses, and the workers are slaves. Good peasants and workers are exploited and oppressed. The Communists only use their labor as a tool for increasing production and use their lives as rebellious capital.</p>
<p>And generally, hooligans and loafers do not engage in production and rely on fighting others to support themselves. They have become new parasites, replacing the old exploiters. The Communists consider them to be active elements and support and encourage them, allowing them to run rampant. Therefore, today's bandit area has become the world of hooligans.</p>
<p>The Communists treat peasants and workers like this, and they are even more brutal to the middle class and the rich. Not only is all their property confiscated, but they also suffer all kinds of torture and humiliation. In the end, they are made to die miserably.</p>
<p>Therefore, I hope that my compatriots across the country will recognize the style and methods of the Communists and rise up together to quell the rebellion in order to safeguard the motherland. The working class should not be deceived by the Communists' propaganda. If the Communists succeed, you will suffer even more. Especially the rich and powerful, if you are not willing to contribute money and effort to support the government in quelling the rebellion, once the Communists succeed, not only will your property immediately be turned into nothing, but you will also die without a burial place. To protect your lives and property, you must quickly wake up and take out money to support the government in quelling the rebellion, otherwise you will regret it too late.</p>
<p>Finally, I remind my compatriots across the country to quickly contribute money and effort to support the government in implementing the Three People's Principles, eliminate the Communists, and safeguard the integrity of the motherland's territory and sovereignty, maintain the existence of a democratic and free system, carry out a moderate social revolution, avoid bloody struggles, drive out the red fascists, and enable the Chinese nation to embark on the road to construction and revival again and become a free, democratic, prosperous, and happy new China. (The End)</p>
<h3 id="e45">Four-Power Talks on Berlin Issue Break Down; Resolved to Submit to Security Council for Handling; Soviet Reply Insists on Controlling Air Corridors <a href="#e45" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c45" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">45</a></h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] Paris, 26th (Broadcast): The three countries, the United States, Britain, and France, issued a communiqué on the 20th, stating that the dispute between the three countries and the Soviet Union regarding the Berlin issue will be submitted to the United Nations Security Council for handling. This was decided by the foreign ministers of the three countries after consultation. U.S. sources said that the three foreign ministers plan to convene another meeting on the evening of the 26th. The three nations decided to end negotiations with the Soviet Union, mainly because the Soviet side raised the demand to control the air corridors.</p>
<p>[Our Dispatch] Paris, 26th (Broadcast): Experts from the Western powers held a meeting in the afternoon of the 26th to continue studying the necessary steps to be taken by the Western powers in submitting the Berlin issue to the Security Council. It is expected that the three countries' note to the Soviet government will be sent to the United Nations together with a memorandum explaining the three countries' attitude. The three countries' reply to the Soviet Union will be drafted by the U.S. Ambassador to Britain, Douglas, the British Undersecretary of State, Strabolgi, and the French Undersecretary of State, de Merville. The foreign ministers of the three countries may hold a meeting to approve the reply.</p>
<p>[United Press, Paris, 26th] The three Western powers decided on the 26th to submit the Berlin crisis to the United Nations Security Council because the Soviet Union, in its reply to the three powers' "final note," refused to lift the Berlin blockade. They also decided to stop direct negotiations with the Soviet Union and appeal to world public opinion. The three powers condemned the Soviet Union's recent note as "unsatisfactory" and accused the Soviet Union of violating the four-power understanding by "unilaterally" publishing the contents of the negotiations. The Soviet Union's recent note is regarded as the final blow to the four-power talks that began in early summer. A Western spokesperson said, "In the long period of negotiations in Berlin and Moscow, the Soviet Union never raised the demand to control air traffic between Berlin and the Western occupied zones." However, in the recent note, the Soviet Union raised this counter-demand, not only attempting to control the land and water traffic that it had blockaded since early summer, but also further attempting to control air transport.</p>
<p>The three powers' communiqué stated in brief: "The Soviet government has failed to guarantee the request to lift the illegal blockade of Berlin, as proposed by the three governments in their note of September 21, 1948. Moreover, it has made a demand to place all commodity transport and passenger traffic via air, waterway, railway, and highway between Berlin and the Western occupied zones under the control of the commander of the Soviet occupying forces in Germany. Furthermore, regarding the currency issue, the Soviet note is evasive and does not provide a clear answer to the attitude expressed by the three governments. Therefore, the three governments have no choice but to notify the Soviet government, fully explaining their position and informing the Soviet government that, based on the Soviet government's firm insistence on continuing the blockade and restricting air traffic, they are forced to submit this matter to the United Nations Security Council in accordance with their obligations under the United Nations Charter." The three foreign ministers held an emergency meeting lasting ninety minutes at the French Foreign Ministry before dinner. They quickly agreed on the above action and will meet again in the evening to draft their letter to the Security Council.</p>
<h3 id="e46">Soviet Side Unilaterally Announces Negotiation Process; Makes Counter-Demands to the Three Powers; Berlin's Land, Sea, and Air Traffic Must Be Controlled by the Soviets <a href="#e46" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c46" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">46</a></h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Moscow, 26th] TASS issued a statement this morning regarding the Berlin situation and the negotiations between the Soviet Union and the three Western powers in August and September concerning this issue. The statement mentioned that in the Soviet government's note to the United States, Britain, and France on July 14, it pointed out that the Berlin situation was caused by the three countries' violation of the Potsdam Agreement and the agreement on controlling Germany and Berlin. TASS continued that the reason for the Western powers' violation was to unilaterally carry out currency reform in the western sectors of Berlin, and at the same time, the Western powers attempted to achieve a policy of splitting Germany.</p>
<p>The statement accused the Western powers of trying to extend their influence into the eastern occupied zone of Germany, causing the economic disintegration of the eastern zone. This situation forced the Soviet Union to take restrictive measures on traffic between Berlin and the western zones to protect the interests of the people in the Soviet zone of Germany and the lifeline of the economy. The statement also mentioned that in early July, the three Western powers had proposed a joint suggestion to the Soviet government, requesting a review of the Berlin situation and the consequences arising from this matter, and the Soviet government expressed its acceptance of this suggestion. According to TASS, the suggestion pointed out that after the Soviet Union and the Western three powers' military commanders in Berlin held negotiations in August, they agreed to implement the following points: (1) Restrictions on passenger and trade transport between Berlin and the three governments in the western zones, as well as the transport of goods from the western zones to the Soviet zone or from the Soviet zone to the western zones, should be lifted; (2) At the same time, the East Mark will be the only currency in circulation in Berlin, and the use of the Western Mark should be prohibited in Berlin. It also stated that the four powers had agreed that the circulation of the Western Mark in Berlin and the regulations regarding currency circulation in Berlin should be under the joint jurisdiction of the four powers. According to the Soviet statement, the reason why the negotiations did not continue was due to three major disagreements between the Soviet Union and the military commanders of the three Western powers: (1) The Soviet government insisted that the transport of passengers and goods between Berlin and the West, including river and road transport, be placed under the control of the Soviet military commander, and that air routes also be subject to control; the four powers also agreed to control the currency in Berlin and the transport between Berlin and the West. (2) The Soviet Union believes that the four-power financial committee and its assigned task of handling currency circulation in Berlin must comply with the agreements concluded by the four powers in Moscow. The Soviet government cannot accept the expansion of this committee's functions to the point where it has the right to interfere in regulations concerning currency circulation throughout the Soviet zone. (3) Regarding the trade between Berlin and the West, and the three countries, the Soviet government agrees to follow the instructions of the United States, Britain, and France, establish a four-power control agency in Berlin, and agree to issue appropriate trade permits to resolve existing differences between the four powers regarding this issue. The statement concludes that the above facts are sufficient to show that the Soviet government's position on resolving the Berlin situation is based on conditions acceptable to all parties concerned. Under these conditions, whether negotiations on this issue should be stopped or whether the four countries should reach a satisfactory agreement, the only key depends on the attitude of the United States, Britain, and France.</p>

<p>[Agence France-Presse, Berlin, 25th] According to unconfirmed reports: 5,000 German police officers have arrived here from the Soviet Union. They will organize a "surveillance network" to control highway and railway traffic, guard train stations, and patrol the suburbs to intensify the blockade of Berlin. They are all former prisoners of war who joined the "Free Germany Committee" and received special training in the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Berlin, 25th, United Press] According to well-informed American sources: The army controlled by Seydwitz, chairman of the Soviet-occupied province of Saxony in Germany, will train a force of approximately 100,000 skilled armed civilian police, so that after the occupying forces withdraw, they can control all of Germany and suppress all resistance. According to the "World Report," this action is currently being carried out in conjunction with strengthening the political position of the Communist Party in the Soviet-occupied zone.</p>
<p>[United Press, Berlin, 25th] One hundred and fifty German communists held a meeting in the British-occupied sector of Berlin on the 25th, with a crowd of approximately 2,500 people, most of whom were onlookers and anti-communist questioners. Over a hundred German doctors from the British-occupied zone were on alert around the perimeter to prevent conflicts. However, when a group of anti-communist youths attempted to disrupt the meeting, a small conflict resulted. Approximately fifteen youths attempted to rush the stage but were driven back by the police, and two were injured. The British military government ordered the police to maintain order because the Communist Party had legally obtained permission to hold the meeting.</p>

<p>[United Press, Prague, 25th] The Czech communist government intensified its anti-American offensive on the 25th, issuing another public statement accusing the American anti-iron general headquarters in Germany of destructive work within Czech territory. This is the sixth such statement issued by the Czech Republic within a week. According to the Prague police, eighteen youths were arrested on the 18th for espionage and terrorism and were found to possess a large number of weapons, which they confessed were used in the February riots.</p>

<p>[United Press, Batavia, 26th] Antara, the official news agency of the Republic of Indonesia, reported on the 26th: The Communist Party, in another successful coup, has occupied the town of Purwokerto, which is only 60 kilometers from Yogyakarta, the capital of the Republic. The leader of the coup, Lieutenant Colonel Soejoto, formerly of the government army, has declared the establishment of a "National Front" government in the area, appointing himself as the chief executive.</p>
<p>In addition, the Communist Party launched a rebellion in Parakan, 70 miles from Yogyakarta, but it has been surrounded by government forces and is currently negotiating surrender. The Communist Party also rioted in Ponorogo, opening fire on government forces and police, but it has been surrounded by government forces. Government forces attacking the city of Madiun made no progress on the 26th.</p>

<p>[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 25th] Today marks the end of the first week after the opening of the United Nations General Assembly, and many delegates and attendants plan to visit Versailles and Paris and its suburbs. The next meeting of the General Assembly is scheduled for 10:30 a.m. on Monday, and the Security Council is scheduled to meet on Tuesday to consider Spitzbergen's application to join the International Court of Justice.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Paris, 25th] The United States has formally responded to the Soviet Union's proposal for a one-third reduction in armaments by the four powers. A spokesperson for the U.S. delegation to the General Assembly declared, "We are willing to carefully study any proposal that is compatible with the control plan of the Atomic Energy Commission or that conforms to the principles of general armaments passed by the majority of member states of the Ordinary Armaments Commission." However, the gist of this is directed at the Soviet Union's insistence over the past year in opposing the proposals made by the United Nations Atomic Energy Commission and the majority of member states of the Ordinary Armaments Commission. Therefore, in effect, the United States' statement implicitly states its position as, "If the Soviet Union agrees to the international safeguards and controls that it has previously consistently opposed, we will then consider the Soviet Union's proposal for a one-third reduction in armaments."</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 25th] Several U.S. shipping company owners have formally protested the Johnston Report, which recommends restoring Japanese merchant ships to the standard of 1930-1934. The American Shipowners Association, representing more than two-thirds of the American shipping industry, sent a letter to Army Secretary Lapham on the 22nd, requesting that the recommendation to restore Japanese ships to four million tons should be implemented only after all circumstances prove that this action is not contrary to sound domestic and foreign policies.</p>
<p>Whether Japan should be at a higher level than the United States in international shipping is questionable, especially since Japan's recovery still relies on U.S. economic support. It is unfair for the United States to economically support Japan, allowing it to surpass neighboring allied countries in economic stability and living standards. This matter requires more consideration, and the consequences of the United States supporting Japan's economic recovery with its economic power should not be ignored.</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 26th] American observers predict: The Soviet Union will further concentrate its attacks on U.S. Far East policy, especially U.S. policy towards Japan and Korea. They said: The statements made by Soviet Ambassador to the United States Panyushkin at the recent two meetings of the Far Eastern Commission show that the Soviet Union has shifted its attention to the East.</p>

<p>[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 26th] The go match between Japanese go master Honinbo and Wu Qingquan is now in its third game. (A total of ten games will be played.) Wu won the first and second games. At the 59th move of the third game, the outcome is also clear, and Wu has hope of winning again. According to go rules, if Honinbo loses four games in a row out of the ten, he will be considered defeated. Therefore, Honinbo must do his best in the third and fourth games. If Honinbo fails, then all other ranked go players in Japan will naturally not be Wu's opponents.</p>

<h3 id="e57">Major Theft Case at Tiger Balm Yong An Tang Solved; Over 30,000 U.S. Dollars Vanish; Acting Manager Confesses to Being the Thief; Soccer Player Cao Qiuting Almost Wrongfully Accused <a href="#e57" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c57" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">57</a></h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] Hu Weizhi, the person in charge of Tiger Balm Yong An Tang, reported to the Old Gate Police Station at approximately 11:15 p.m. on the 24th, stating that 39,000 U.S. dollars had been stolen. According to Hu's report: On the 18th, he retrieved 200 taels of gold and 50,000 U.S. dollars that he had previously deposited with a friend surnamed Zheng in Nanjing. At 7:00 a.m. on the 19th, he arrived at the Yong An Tang branch on Ningbo Road No. 595 in Shanghai, and that evening at approximately 7:00 p.m., he handed the U.S. dollars and gold he had brought to acting manager Zheng Yuangui to be locked in the safe. However, because the amount was too large, he was afraid of attracting attention. So that evening, he purchased three airplane-style Chinese leather suitcases from the Bosideng Leather Goods Company and took the U.S. dollars out of the safe, hiding them in specially made cloth bags inside the suitcases. At that time, acting manager Zheng directed the distribution of the U.S. dollars into the suitcases. As for the 200 taels of gold, it had already been sold to the Guohuo Bank on the 20th. At 6:00 p.m. on the 22nd, he opened the first light yellow suitcase, and the 11,000 U.S. dollars contained within were sold to the Guohuo Bank in full. The remaining two dark yellow suitcases, containing 39,000 U.S. dollars, remained sealed in the bedroom. Until approximately 8:00 a.m. on the 24th, Cao Qiuting (a soccer star), an employee from the Hong Kong headquarters, and Jin Lu sent his younger brother back to Hong Kong from Longhua Airport. After finishing the task and returning to the store, Cao stated that the airport security was strict, and some people were even paying attention to their actions. Therefore, he was concerned that the suitcases stored in the store might be unsafe and suggested that the two dark yellow suitcases be transferred to a friend surnamed Zhu's place for safekeeping. Hu refused directly because these U.S. dollars were about to be sold to the Guohuo Bank, and there was no need for a futile trip back and forth. Subsequently, Cao Qiuting took them away, intending to deliver them to the Guohuo Bank on his behalf. Unexpectedly, at 9:00 a.m. that morning, Hu suddenly received a phone call from Cao, saying: The two suitcases contained only 1,640 U.S. dollars, and the rest of the money had vanished. Because the incident was so bizarre, he reported it to the police to arrest the thief.</p>
<p>After receiving the report, Zhao Zhaosheng, chief of the Old Gate Police Station, personally led Criminal Section Chief Jiang Shangpei, section member Zhang Kuidong, and police officer Sun Juemin to rush to the scene for a detailed investigation. The result was that no clues could be found. After inspecting the cloth bags in the three empty suitcases, there were also no flaws. However, the most suspected in this case were Cao Qiuting and driver Qiu Youxiang, who were responsible for delivering and opening the money, Zheng Yuangui, who directed the packing, and packer Chu Yingqiu. All four were taken to the police station for questioning. According to Cao Qiuting's confession, he did indeed obtain three suitcases from Hu at 7:55 a.m. He hired a car from the Taishan Motor Company to take him to his home at No. 9 Xinsheng Lane, Jianguo West Road. He opened the suitcases to take out the stored U.S. dollars and transfer them to the bank. Unexpectedly, after opening the three suitcases, he discovered that only 1,640 U.S. dollars remained. He immediately carried the three suitcases back to Yong An Tang in the same car and handed them over to Hu Weizhi for inspection. He had not committed any theft. According to the driver's confession: The car stopped at the alley entrance for 25 minutes. He saw Cao carrying the original suitcase out and returning to Yong An Tang, and he did not get out of the car along the way.</p>
<p>Proving Honesty</p>
<p>According to acting manager Zheng Yuangui's confession: He is Hu's close relative. At the time, Hu was by his side and vigorously stated that Zheng was honest and had not been in office for long. He had no relatives or friends in Shanghai and did not believe he would commit theft. As for the packer Chu Yingqiu, there were many people monitoring him when he was packing, so he would not have committed theft either. At this point, Cao's suspicion seemed greater, so police officers went to the homes of Cao Qiuting and Chu Yingqiu to investigate, and everything matched their confessions. At this time, the police station learned that Zheng had secretly reported to the Economic Brigade that Hu was suspected of hoarding gold and cash, and his intention was obviously to try to get the Economic Brigade to summon Hu for interrogation. He dared not directly say the correct amount of U.S. dollars to cover up the theft.</p>
<p>Finally Confessing the Truth</p>
<p>Section Chief Jiang personally questioned Zheng strictly, and Zheng could not hide it any longer. He finally confessed the whole story, admitting that at 12:00 a.m. on the 22nd, after assisting the worker Chu Yingqiu in finishing packing the suitcases, he carried the two suitcases to Hu's bedroom. At that time, Hu was already fast asleep. He secretly carried the two suitcases to his own bedroom and, while the paste was not yet dry, pulled open the pasted seals, took out the cloth bags, and stole all the U.S. dollars inside. He used the same method to open the second suitcase, stealing the U.S. dollars, leaving only a portion, totaling 1,640 U.S. dollars, in the suitcase. After finishing, he placed the suitcases back in Hu's bedroom. At 7:00 a.m. on the 23rd, he wrapped the stolen U.S. dollars in two packages of kraft paper and stored a small number in the safe. Later, he wrote a letter to his family, enclosing 250 U.S. dollars (in fifty-dollar bills), and sent it to his mother. At 10:00 a.m. on the 24th, because Cao Qiuting discovered that the suitcases were missing U.S. dollars, in order to avoid exposure, he disguised all the stolen U.S. dollars in packets of iodine pills and placed them in the cargo room, without hiding. He also vehemently denied that any accomplices were involved.</p>
<p>Still Missing Over One Hundred Dollars</p>
<p>According to the confession, the investigating officer escorted the suspect Zheng to the address to retrieve the stolen goods, totaling 36,925 U.S. dollars, plus the remaining 1,640 U.S. dollars in the suitcase, and the 250 U.S. dollars that had been remitted, for a total of 38,815 U.S. dollars. This was still 185 U.S. dollars short of the total of 39,000 U.S. dollars that had been stolen, which has not yet been found. Zheng Yuangui was charged with theft, along with the evidence of three cloth bags, and transferred to the District Prosecutor's Office. As for the retrieved 36,925 U.S. dollars, although the investigation revealed no suspicion of operating on the black market or evading gold, the police station, for the sake of caution, will send them to the Central Bank to be exchanged for gold yuan coupons and returned to the victim Hu Weizhi for collection.</p>

<p>Regarding the reduction of automobiles in the city, the Municipal Government is taking the lead by stopping the use of shuttle buses at noon and having senior staff and workers share a car. The Municipal Public Works Bureau is currently drafting measures for reducing private automobiles. It is learned that the method adopted will first carefully review the qualifications of each car owner according to the standards previously announced by the central government. Those who do not meet the qualifications will have their automobile permits cancelled. If there are still too many, then the second step will be to adopt a lottery system to eliminate cars. These measures will be announced and implemented soon. Also, in order to discourage the use of cars and save gasoline, it is planned to cooperate with the police to take measures to ban cars from going to entertainment venues. As for the number of gasoline needed for postal and telecommunications vehicles, it will not be reduced, but it is hoped that "every drop will be used for public purposes" and no gasoline will be wasted.</p>

However, the initiators of the corps hope that this new organization can resonate with the youth across the country and promote a nationwide social reform movement.</p>

<h3 id="e67">Child Fare Exemption Standards to Change on Two Railway Lines Next Month <a href="#e67" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c67" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">67</a></h3>
<p>The Beijing-Shanghai Railway Administration will change the method of exempting children from ticket fees on the railways, starting from the first of next month. According to a spokesperson from the Beijing-Shanghai Railway Administration, the Ministry of Communications' Road Administration Department believes that the current railway passenger transport regulations, which stipulate that children under the age of four are exempt from ticket fees and those between four and twelve years of age are charged half fare, should be changed to use school age as the standard. The average school age for children in China is six years old. Therefore, the revised regulations will exempt children under the age of six from ticket fees and charge half fare for those between six and twelve years of age. If there is doubt about the age, the height will be used as the determining factor. According to a survey by the Ministry of Health, the average height of a six-year-old child is 1.1 meters, and the average height of a twelve-year-old child is 1.4 meters. This will be used as the standard for determining height. The order to change this standard has been issued by the Ministry of Communications to all relevant agencies and has been decided to be implemented starting on the first of next month.</p>

<p>Regarding the case of dumping Yongsheng stock and profiting over 700 billion yuan before the currency reform, a senior official from the Ministry of Finance revealed a shocking secret while in Shanghai. According to reports, the "hidden name" who sold over 30 million shares of Yongsheng and made a profit of over 700 billion yuan is a chubby middle-aged person, while Tao Qiming is very thin.

<h3 id="e72">Fangjian's First Retail Store; Rush to Buy Woolen Fabrics; Standing in Line Overnight for Over Ten Hours; Profiteers Rampant; Company Considering Identity Card Purchase System <a href="#e72" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c72" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">72</a></h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Since Fangjian Company's first retail store on Maoming South Road began selling woolen fabrics and serge from the Executive Yuan's Material Supply Bureau, the low prices have led to unprecedented crowds of citizens rushing to buy them. To maintain order, the company issues numbered tickets each day before sales begin, allowing customers to purchase one piece of material (six yards) in order according to the ticket number, limiting the supply to 600 people per day, with 200 tickets for government employees and 400 for ordinary citizens. To facilitate government employees, those with identification are given tickets first. It is understood that the congestion at the store has become increasingly serious. More than a thousand citizens line up each day to receive a ticket. Fearing being left out, some even start lining up at the entrance of Fangjian Company at 6:00 PM the day before, waiting for over twelve hours. After receiving a ticket at 10:00 AM the next day, they can then enter to purchase the material. Even in light rain, many bring umbrellas and bread with them. The degree of crowding is worse than the situation when buying rice in previous days. However, because of the potential profits, "scalpers" are rampant. It is rumored that these scalpers disrupt the lines of waiting citizens in the quiet hours before dawn, often pushing their way to the front and obtaining tickets first, while the citizens who have been standing in line all night are unable to buy the material.</p>
<p>At Least Six Months of Sales</p>
<p>A reporter visited Hu Songhan, the manager of the company, yesterday. According to Hu, the company has ample inventory in its warehouse. The current inventory is sufficient for at least six months. Therefore, citizens do not need to rush. However, the company is concerned that the emergence of "scalpers" will make it difficult for ordinary citizens to enjoy their rights and that all the benefits will go to the "scalpers." To prevent this, in addition to asking the Kan Jian Brigade to maintain order regularly, the company is now considering suggesting a thorough solution to the authorities: citizens must purchase material with their identity cards. When the purchase reaches a certain standard, a stamp will be added to the identity card, and they will not be allowed to buy it again this season. Manager Hu said that the company is still drafting the purchase standards and detailed procedures. If the above method is implemented, the "scalpers" will disappear, the interests of citizens can be equalized, and the congestion can be alleviated.</p>
<p>Convenient for Civil Servants; Sales Every Sunday</p>
<p>In order to facilitate the purchase by civil servants, the company is open for sales as usual on Sundays and closed on Mondays. Starting yesterday, Sundays will be reserved for civil servants only. Ordinary citizens can only purchase from Tuesdays to Saturdays. Due to the congestion, the company's employees handle over a hundred transactions each day, and the office hours exceed ten hours.</p>

<p>In order to prevent corrupt officials, illegal merchants, and political criminals from escaping to Hong Kong, the Songhu Garrison Headquarters was ordered to implement a traveler registration system for those going to Hong Kong. The Garrison Headquarters has been very strict in reviewing applications for travel to Hong Kong. However, merchants and criminals are exceptionally cunning. Since the traveler registration system is only implemented in Shanghai, they are taking routes through Guangzhou and then to Hong Kong. This situation occurs frequently. The Garrison Headquarters has reported this to the central government and recommends that traveler registration be implemented nationwide to prevent criminals from escaping justice.</p>
<h3 id="e75">The Bandits on the Waters of Dinghai are Eliminated; Leader Wang Rongxuan Executed; Over 500 Captured Bandits Escorted to Shanghai <a href="#e75" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c75" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">75</a></h3>
<p>On the 10th of this month, Navy Commander-in-Chief Gui Yongqing personally led a fleet to supervise the suppression of bandits in the Dinghai Zhoushan Islands. After two weeks, major results were achieved. The bandits in the area have been eliminated, and the waters around Dinghai, which had been blockaded since the 10th, have been reopened, facilitating fishermen and travelers. Gui successfully completed his mission and returned to Shanghai on the 25th aboard the flagship "Yongxing" and will travel to Nanjing today. It is understood that the bandits in the waters of Dinghai, Zhejiang, were led by Wang Rongxuan and Xu Xiaoyu, who colluded with each other to harass the local population, commit murder, and extort money. Wang and Xu even colluded with the Communist bandits and were appointed as fake "Zhoushan Islands Guerrilla Commanders," becoming quite rampant. Although the army, navy, and police stationed in Dinghai have repeatedly suppressed them, they have not been able to eliminate them due to the complex island geography and special environment of Dinghai. In order to prevent the spread of the bandit forces, Commander-in-Chief Gui led the "Zhonghai," "Zhongji," and other ships, as well as the Marine Corps, the Naval Police Battalion, and a portion of the Youth Army to suppress them on the 10th. The army and navy coordinated, searching each island and annihilating many bandits. They also captured bandit leader Wang Rongxuan and over 200 others. Bandit Wang was executed locally in Dinghai after being captured. The officers and soldiers of the Second Security Police Company of Dinghai, numbering over 300, were disarmed due to suspected collusion with the bandits, and were transported to Shanghai along with the captured bandits, totaling over 500, on the 25th by the "Zhonghai" and "Zhongji" ships. They are currently being interrogated by the military law office of the First Naval District Command. The Political Warfare Office of the Military District Command has scheduled a visit for reporters from local newspapers to view the captured bandits at 2:00 PM this afternoon.</p>
<p>There is No Deputy Commander in the Military District Command</p>
<p>Li Yuelin, Director of the Political Warfare Office of the First Naval District Command, stated that the report in the newspaper on the 26th that "Deputy Commander of the First Naval District Zhang Huifang personally commanded the suppression in Dinghai" was a misunderstanding. The headquarters of this military district does not have a deputy commander position. It may be that an illegal person is impersonating the position. The relevant authorities have ordered an investigation. According to reporters, Zhang Huifang was originally a pirate who operated in the area of Pudong and the Dinghai and Shengsi Islands. Most of the bandits suppressed this time were his former subordinates.</p>

Yang Wenfu and Li Baoqing were jointly convicted of murder and sentenced to twelve years of imprisonment each, with ten years of deprivation of civil rights. Hao Zhouquan was sentenced to three months of imprisonment for harboring a criminal, which can be commuted to a fine of one yuan per day. Li Xuezhong was found not guilty. The murder weapon, a knife, was confiscated. Yang Wenfu originally operated a barbershop in a shed built against the wall to the right of the Dafeng Laurel Shop in Liujia Lane, and Li Baoqing set up a pancake stall next to him. In April of this year, when the Dafeng Shop was repairing its buildings, the two were discovered by the Public Works Bureau to have built illegal structures and by the Electricity Company to have illegally installed electricity meters. Yang and Li suspected that Dai Shaonong, an assistant at the Dafeng Shop, was behind it, so they harbored resentment and sought revenge against the shop. On May 26 of the same year, Yang and Li conspired to murder Dai. They pre-arranged a butcher knife and ambushed Dai at the entrance of Dasheng Lane, Minguo Road, at 6:00 AM on the 29th of the same month. When Dai approached alone, Yang grabbed his collar, and Li stabbed him in the left leg. Yang then murdered Dai, and they fled to the home of Hao Zhouquanzhen in Suzhou, who knew of their crime, for shelter. They then fled to Nanjing, where the police quickly arrested them and a suspect named Li Xuezhong, and transferred them to the court for trial. The sentence was pronounced as above.</p>
<h3 id="e77">Rising Sun Building Sewage Ditch Project Needs Over 90,000 Yuan; Benefit Fee Apportionment Determined; Collected Separately According to Four Grades <a href="#e77" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c77" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">77</a></h3>
<p>The Municipal Government's Flood Prevention Committee, in order to carry out the sewage ditch project in the Rising Sun Building area on Nanjing East Road and Zhejiang Middle Road, invited shop residents and representatives from the four major companies Yong'an, Sincere, etc., including Guo Linshuang, Cai Huimin, Wang Qijun, and Liu Xiexun, the other day. They decided to collect benefit fees for the flood prevention project through an apportionment method. The method was well supported by the representatives, and it was decided to pay the fees within two weeks. The flood prevention project has been decided to bury a 33-inch diameter sewage ditch and add a pumping station. The starting point of the sewage ditch is Tianjin Road and Zhejiang Middle Road, along Tianjin Road through Guangxi Road, turning to Guizhou Road, Ningbo Road, Yunnan Road, Liuhe Road, Fenyang Road, and linking to the 4.5-foot diameter ditch on Tibet Middle Road, a total length of 858 meters. The pumping station on the Suzhou River on Tibet Road will be expanded. The entire project requires more than 97,000 Gold Yuan, and it is expected to be completed within six months. The principles for calculating the benefit fee are determined as follows: (1) The benefited area is divided into four zones according to the distance from the water accumulation area. The zones are divided into the first zone for direct beneficiaries, the second zone for the surrounding area, and so on outward to the third and fourth zones. The widths of each zone are approximately equal. (2) The total amount of benefit fees for each zone is calculated proportionally to the length of the facade and inversely proportional to the square of the distance from the water accumulation area. (3) The benefit for each household is calculated according to the ratio of the financial bureau's valuation of the house. (4) The minimum benefit fee for each zone is 20 yuan for the first zone, 10 yuan for the second zone, 8 yuan for the third zone, and 6 yuan for the fourth zone.</p>

<h3 id="e80">Concrete Plan to Solve Western Medicine Shortage to be Announced in Days <a href="#e80" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c80" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">80</a></h3>
<p>Zhang Wei, Director of the Health Bureau, visited Nanjing to consult with relevant health authorities regarding the supply of medicines and the problem of diverting medicine sources in the city. He returned to Shanghai the other day. According to Director Zhang, a satisfactory solution has been obtained for the serious medicine shortage in the city. Due to practical difficulties, a concrete plan has been drafted after careful consultation and discussion and will be officially announced within days. The main points are as follows: (1) Since Shanghai is the commercial center of the country, the medicine shortage in Shanghai is enough to affect all parts of the country. In view of this, the central government has specially approved emergency imports of medicine in order to solve the medicine shortage during the transition period. (2) Before the medicines are shipped in, pharmacies in the city can apply to the Health Bureau for advance loans if they urgently need to sell medicines, and then return them after the medicine import quotas are determined. (3) During this period of medicine shortage, it is hoped that medical and pharmaceutical groups in the city will abide by government laws and regulations, maintain the market price of "August 19," and wait for the government to make reasonable adjustments. The Health Bureau is also providing the central government with actual information for reference. (4) In order to meet actual needs, the Health Bureau will form a joint conference with the city's transportation management authorities and medical and pharmaceutical groups in order to find a reasonable solution to the city's medicine shortage.</p>
<h3 id="e81">Hoping Everyone Participates in Labor to Universally Raise Living Standards: Shui Xiangyun Discusses the Diligence and Frugality Movement <a href="#e81" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c81" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">81</a></h3>
<p>Shui Xiangyun, Chairman of the Shanghai General Labor Union, recently expressed his views on the Diligence and Frugality for National Construction Movement, stating that the movement is a further action based on the New Life Movement and the National Economic Construction Movement, and its essence is to reform society. He believes that all compatriots across the country have this need. Taking Shanghai society as an example, a life of luxury, waste, and decadence fills the city, and it is urgent to make progress. Therefore, the Diligence and Frugality for National Construction Movement is actually a new moral movement to revive the country through "labor." Mr. Shui said that diligence and frugality should focus on cities. Currently, the consumption of urban people is disconnected from production. Therefore, frugality should first be implemented in major cities such as Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Wuhan, Beiping, and Tianjin, and then popularized throughout the country. At the same time, it must be from top to bottom, and more attention should be paid to whether officials, wealthy landlords, and rich classes are practicing it, because the affairs of the poor in our country are below the standard, and they have reached a level where there is nothing more to save. He also cited the United Kingdom as an example, where frugality is very thorough. From the royal family to the poor, everyone follows it uniformly. This kind of spirit of sharing joys and sorrows from top to bottom is truly admirable. The rationing system is also very equal, and everyone is treated equally, which we should emulate. Therefore, it is hoped that officials, wealthy landlords, and the rich class will no longer just shout slogans but should lead by example to promote the movement. Mr. Shui also put forward five concrete suggestions: (1) People should first save manpower. Whether it is an organization, company, or individual, they should save as much as possible. (2) Things should be simplified. Unnecessary socializing, meetings, and the circulation of some official documents should be reduced. Especially for weddings, funerals, and celebrations, there should be frugality. (3) Things should be used to their fullest. Whether it is an organization or factory, things should be used to their fullest, and waste should be saved. Luxury decorations should be discarded. (4) Time should be saved. At the same time, it is more important to respect time and seize the moment. (5) Land should be used to its fullest, and the slogan "Leave no land unused" should be put forward. Mr. Shui believes that during this period of suppressing the rebellion and building the country, we should save on the one hand and strive to produce on the other. Finally, Mr. Shui emphasized the true meaning of economic democratization and rationalized life. The government should encourage people from all walks of life to work equally to increase production. All workers should have food to eat, and parasites and those who gain without labor should be transformed to participate in labor. Then, the phenomenon of social inequality can be eliminated, and the living standards of our people can be universally raised.</p>
<p>Yimiao and Penglai Districts Promote the Diligence and Frugality Movement</p>
<p>The people of Yimiao and Penglai Districts in this city held a propaganda meeting for the Diligence and Frugality for National Construction Movement at the Civil Women's High School in the Confucius Temple at 3:00 p.m. yesterday. More than a thousand representatives from all walks of life and the public attended. Shao Xinshi, Cao Zhiyuan, Xu Hongzao, Wu Xichai, and others presided over the meeting and reported on the significance of the Diligence and Frugality for National Construction Movement. Subsequently, Director Fang of the Municipal Party Headquarters delivered a speech on behalf of Yi Muge. Finally, a telegram of respect to the President was passed. The original text reads: "Respectfully reading your recent instruction on the Diligence and Frugality for National Construction Movement, it targets current abuses and offers critical advice, so as to lead the masses and seek the utmost for the nation. We listen attentively and are all inspired. This association solemnly held a propaganda meeting today and unanimously decided to support it, supervise all walks of life, and work hard to achieve it. We humbly submit our sincere feelings, hoping for your attention. Propaganda Meeting for the Diligence and Frugality for National Construction Movement by All Circles in Penglai and Yimiao Districts of Shanghai, respectfully."</p>

<p>Weekly Economy</p>
<h3 id="e82">General Commodity Prices: A Discussion on the Current Market Situation, with Improvement Needed in the Future <a href="#e82" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c82" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">82</a></h3>
<p>From August 23rd, after the promulgation of the New Economic Program on August 19th, the market transactions, up to the end of last week, have lasted exactly one month and three days. During this month or so, because Mr. Chiang Ching-kuo was responsible for supervising the implementation of the new program in Shanghai, the measures were serious and strict. Therefore, Shanghai achieved the best results, and transactions were able to abide by the law, and price limits always stood firm. It is said that the South China region sent people to Shanghai to study Mr. Chiang's "secrets of success."</p>
<p>While we are pleased with the success of price controls in Shanghai, we cannot help but make further explorations into the current market situation. Because Shanghai accounts for too much importance in the national economy, the authorities' control focus was also particularly focused on Shanghai after the implementation of this new program, believing that controlling Shanghai could effectively stabilize national prices. So far, Shanghai has managed to maintain the August 19th prices. However, the control situation in other areas is not ideal, forming a situation in which Shanghai's prices are isolated and relatively low. Therefore, even under strict laws and punishments, Shanghai's goods still have a restless intention to escape to other areas, this being the first point. Because of the relatively low prices in Shanghai, in the long run, the raw materials and local products from other areas will show a phenomenon of shrinking back from Shanghai, this being the second point. After the implementation of the new program, idle funds have not been effectively absorbed. It is estimated that the current idle funds accumulated in Shanghai are about 300 million yuan, which is a huge number far beyond the previous legal currency era. At the same time, the underground interest rate in Shanghai is as low as six percent, and short-term funds are not easy to borrow. It is said that the underground interest rate in various cities in the southwest is still as high as two cents or more, this being the third point. Combining the aforementioned factors, we feel that the price control in Shanghai urgently needs to recognize the crux of the problem. On top of the existing achievements, we need to turn in another direction to ensure the 100% success of the new program.</p>
<p>Commodity Prices Showing a Steady but Upward Trend</p>
<p>Due to the abundance and active flow of idle funds, the trend of the commodity market last week had a rising trend in prices. However, due to fear of the authorities' control, they did not dare to violate the price limits. However, there were many cases of prices rising to the limits, which are too numerous to mention.</p>
<p>In terms of cotton cloth, 42-count Blue Phoenix was seen on Monday and Tuesday with prices of 1050 yuan and 1060 yuan. There were no prices after Wednesday, but there were still many miscellaneous brands. About hundreds of pieces of 21-count Double Horse were traded on the market every day, with prices rising from 770 yuan on Monday to 783 yuan at the end of the week. Long-staple fine cloth was absorbed by individual brokers, once seeing 128 yuan and 5 jiao in the Three Associations. After the registration of inventory, people were nervous, and it fell back to 120 yuan and 7 jiao at the end of the week.</p>
<p>Because the prices of other commodities rose, and the arrival of food was relatively concerned, the prices were very firm. High-end goods were rarely seen on the market, and lower-quality goods rose to the price limit. White japonica rice on the North Market stood at 20 yuan and 9 jiao at the end of the week. The oil market was stable with a slight upward trend. Qingdao virgin oil stood at 59 yuan and 9 jiao on Thursday. Old brands of flour were not traded, and miscellaneous brands were available on the market, with prices standing at the price limit.</p>
<p>Daily necessities such as soap, matches, and cigarettes showed mixed trends compared to last week, with ups and downs. Solid brand soap stood at 25 yuan and 6 jiao at the end of the week. Beautiful matches stood at 117 yuan. High-end cigarettes were still rarely seen, and most remained at the price limit.</p>
<p>New Measures Repeatedly Implemented by Economic Supervision</p>
<p>The new measures formulated last week under the auspices of the Economic Supervision Office included: (1) In order to understand the actual quantity of raw materials and necessities in the city's factories, the Supervision Office decided to start a general registration of materials in the city from the 25th to the 30th, and ordered all registration procedures to be completed within these five days. Registration method: The Municipal Social Affairs Bureau will first distribute the registration forms to more than 300 trade associations in the city, and the trade associations will distribute them to various stores, firms, factories, and warehouses, which will fill in the actual numbers themselves. The form is divided into the name of the goods, unit, quantity, and monthly sales volume. It is limited to being submitted to the various trade associations before the 27th, and the trade associations will submit them to the Social Affairs Bureau on the 28th for transfer to the Supervision Office for verification.</p>
<p>The registration of necessities is limited to rice, noodles, flour, yarn, cloth, paper, edible oil, and industrial raw materials. It is also stipulated that after the investigation, the merchants must still sell at retail prices and supply the market. After the registration is completed, a comprehensive general inspection will be implemented, mobilizing 5,000 people, and starting next week, a general inspection of warehouses will be carried out. If unregistered goods and raw materials are found, they will be confiscated, and the owners will be severely punished according to law.</p>
<p>(2) In principle, foreign exchange is allowed for self-supply, and all imports are limited to industrial raw materials, necessities, and machinery.</p>
<p>(3) In principle, it is decided that if Shanghai's industrial products have a surplus, the surplus items may be transported to other areas, based on the principle of not affecting the city's prices. The transportation method is to obtain contact from trade associations in the producing and marketing areas to prevent forced sales, hoarding, manipulation, and other illegal behaviors. If violations of the above regulations are found, they will be severely punished.</p>
<p>(4) The deadline for the exchange of gold, silver, and US dollars is set for the end of this month and will not be extended. If it is found after the deadline, it will be severely punished according to law.</p>
<p>Improved Sales of State-Owned Stocks</p>
<p>Since the issuance of state-owned enterprise stocks, sales have been sluggish, and have become even more desolate last week. It is reported that the National Bank is seeking to open up sales and has decided on three methods: (1) The assets and liabilities of each unit of state-owned enterprises should be reported and printed separately as soon as possible for investors to choose.</p>
<p>(2) Guarantee the interests of investors and increase dividends. (3) Revise the dividend payment method to increase the interest of investors. In the past, interest was paid once a year, but now it is planned to pay interest every three months. (4) Increase the sales area and gradually spread it to major cities. The authorities have begun to study methods to restore the special auction of state-owned enterprise stocks on the stock exchange. In addition, Taiwan has also reached an agreement, and sales will begin soon. Hankou, Chongqing, and other places are also planning.</p>
<p>Short-Term Treasury Bonds Return to the Market</p>
<p>Short-term national bonds were re-issued in Shanghai by the Central Bank starting on Thursday. The bond denominations are divided into 50 yuan, 100 yuan, 500 yuan, 1,000 yuan, and 5,000 yuan in gold yuan. They are issued at a discount on the face value with one month until maturity. The discount rate is calculated on a monthly interest rate of 1.5%. The discount is posted daily. The first day's quoted price was issued at 98.5. From the date of issuance to the end of last week, more than 30 million yuan was sold. At a time when idle funds are struggling to find a way out, the re-emergence of treasury bonds is timely. With a fixed term of only one month, they are not too long and meet market needs. Therefore, sales are promising.</p>
<h3 id="e83">Currency and Finance: Abundance of Idle Funds Urgently Needs Guidance <a href="#e83" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c83" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">83</a></h3>
<p>In the financial market of this city last week, on the one hand, the supply of short-term funds was absolutely strong, but on the other hand, the demand for funds was extremely weak. As a result, the abundance of funds has presented an unprecedentedly serious situation. Since the currency reform, the source of idle funds in this city has always been more than the outflow, and the amount has become larger and larger. The authorities originally planned to sell shares of state-owned enterprises as one of the methods to divert idle funds, but in just a few days, the people's appetite seemed to have reached saturation early. The total amount sold was less than 1% of the original planned issuance. So, starting from Thursday last week, the authorities had to issue treasury bonds as a remedy, which was much better than selling shares of state-owned enterprises.</p>
<p>It is estimated that the total amount of idle funds accumulated in this city has reached about 400 million yuan. Among them, such as the continuous withdrawals of national banks in the past ten days or so, it will soon reach 30 million yuan. The outlet for idle funds must be guaranteed. Without a guarantee, idle funds can only stay in the bank and wait for an opportunity to move. But it can be asserted that idle funds will inevitably seek an outlet. If it does not go on a legitimate path related to production, then it will go on an illegitimate path unrelated to production. Temporary calm is not necessarily a good phenomenon, because after a while, perhaps the effect of the disturbance will be more intense, so preventing problems before they occur is really an urgent matter!</p>
<p>Accumulation of Short-Term Funds and Falling Underground Interest Rates</p>
<p>The underground interest rate in the market last week has always been hovering at a low level, generally between six and seven and a half percent. The lower limit has fallen below the six-cent six-cent interest rate quoted by the money shops before the Fifth District, which is also rarely seen before. Furthermore, the monthly interest rate on weekly deposits in some local banks and firms in this city has not only decreased to below three percent, but the banks and firms are no longer interested in this deposit. From this, it is not difficult to see the general accumulation of short-term funds in the market. But one phenomenon is quite noteworthy, that is, there is an eager demand in the market for longer-term loans of one month or three months, and the interest rate is as high as two cents or more. If there are no special reasons, it can be interpreted as an unstable response to the psychological state of the general public in the economic market.</p>
<p>Last week's brokerage interest was generally fixed at 2 yuan per day, and the monthly interest was only about six percent.</p>
<p>Increased Outflow of National Banks and Increased Inflow of Foreign Firms</p>
<p>Last week's clearing results of national banks showed continued large outflows for payments such as the purchase of materials. From Monday to the weekend, there were outflows every day, totaling 11,115,879 yuan, an increase of more than 1,759,000 yuan compared to the same period last week.</p>
<p>The clearing results of foreign banks showed a total inflow of 4,088,787 yuan from Monday to Friday, an increase of more than 1,852,100 yuan compared to the same period last week.</p>
<p>Commercial banks and firms have an exceptionally abundant supply of funds, and there are many long positions everywhere. Interbank lending has not been done at all. There is no outlet for idle funds. The depression of the financial industry can be said to be increasing day by day. Last week, the clearing results of the banks and firms after the 60th showed an overall inflow. From Monday to Friday, the total inflow reached a huge 4,820,000 yuan. After deducting the 80,000 yuan inflow of the Taiwan Bank in the past five days, the indirect clearing inflow of commercial banks and firms still reached more than 4,703,000 yuan, which gives a general view of the accumulation of short-term funds in the industry.</p>
<p>Domestic Exchange Rates Falling and Hong Kong Market Rising</p>
<p>Last week, the trend of domestic exchange rates in commercial banks continued to decline. The exchange rate for Guangzhou remained unchanged, at 24 yuan from Monday to Friday. The exchange rate for Xiamen decreased from 24 yuan at the end of the previous week to 20 yuan on Monday of last week and has not changed since. The exchange rate for Chongqing saw a decrease, from 20 yuan at the end of the previous week to 16 yuan on Monday of last week, then falling to 12 yuan on Tuesday, and then falling to a low level of 10 yuan on Friday. The exchange rate for Hankou also continued to fall, from 16 yuan on Monday to 12 yuan on Tuesday, and then falling to 10 yuan on Friday. The exchange rate for Tianjin was 10 yuan at the end of the previous week, and it fell and stabilized at the level of 5 yuan last week.</p>
<p>For foreign exchange rates, the price of Hong Kong gold was 296 yuan and 5 jiao per tael on Monday, and then it continued to rise, reaching 298 yuan 5 jiao 1 on Thursday. The price fell 2 cents on Tuesday, and then rose back to 5 yuan 1 jiao 8 cents on Wednesday and Thursday. The Hong Kong exchange rate remained stable, and the official exchange rate was the same as the previous week.</p>
<p>The wholesale price index classified by use for last week is as follows: The total wholesale price index for last week increased by 1.48% compared to the third week of August. The wholesale price index classified by the degree of processing for last week is as follows: August</p>
<p>The wholesale price index classified by country of origin and sales for last week is as follows:</p>

<p>[Report from our newspaper] Since the currency reform, the food expenses for public-funded students in national colleges and universities in this city have been changed to four yuan and two jiao, and the rice is still two dou and three sheng. Among them, two dou of rice are worth one yuan and six jiao, and the other three sheng are calculated based on the market price of rice, which is worth about five jiao and five fen. This month, each public-funded student can get about five yuan, eight jiao, and one fen. Northern national college students have asked the Department of Education to increase the benefits for public-funded students, and the submission has been taken to Beijing by President Hu Shi. It is said that some national college students in this city are also preparing to jointly request an increase in public funds, and the submission is being drafted and will be sent to Beijing soon.</p>
<h3 id="e86">Opening of the Yi Police Basketball Game Produces an Upset: Songshan Loses to Lujiawan. Changshu Loses to Laozha After Fierce Battle. <a href="#e86" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c86" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">86</a></h3>
<p>The Guozhen Cup Yi Police Basketball Tournament opened at the Zhongqing Gymnasium yesterday afternoon at 1:30 p.m. Four games in Group B and two in Group A were played. As a result, the four teams directly under Zhenru, Gaoqiao, and Penglai in Group B won. Except for the fact that the ratio between the Directly-Affiliated team's victory over Huangpu was still close, the rest became one-sided. In the Group A game, Laozha faced Changshu, and the battle was particularly fierce. Changshu had overtaken twice and tied three times, but in the end, they lost to Laozha with a score of 37 to 56. The score in the first half was 21 to 23, only one point behind. In the final game, Songshan fought against Lujiawan. Songshan had famous players such as Bao Songyuan and Chen Xuechong, and it was thought that they would definitely win. Who knew that there would be an upset? Songshan was quite active at the beginning of the game. Although Lujiawan resisted strongly, they were behind all the way. In the first half, Songshan took the lead with a score of 19 to 16. After changing sides, the generals of Lujiawan suddenly became smooth, and there were many loopholes in the Songshan lineup. Lujiawan was able to come from behind and overwhelm Songshan with a score of 41 to 29. The opening game produced an upset, which is also said to be strange. The results of each game yesterday are recorded below:</p>
<p>Directly Affiliated Won Huangpu (Group B Yi) 20-11 Zhuyi Lai Won Changning (Group B Yong) 32-5</p>
<p>Zhenru Won Hongkou (Group B Yong) 45-6 Lao Zha Won Changshu (Group A) 56-37</p>
<p>Gaoqiao Won Yimiao (Group B Yi) 33-13 Lujiawan Won Songshan (Group A) 41-29</p>

<h3 id="e93">What Vegetables to Buy? <a href="#e93" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c93" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">93</a></h3>
<p>— Zan Ying</p>
<p>In recent years, the vegetable markets have always been extremely profitable. As a result, the faces of the vegetable vendors have been consistently unpleasant. A single disagreement would elicit the response, "Don't buy it, then!"</p>
<p>Before the currency reform, they raised prices at will and "tailored the price to the person." New housewives suffered the most. Arguing with them was exhausting, and they would give you a hard time with sarcastic remarks. So, more experienced housewives and maids learned to "grab a handful while handing over a bunch and scoop up an extra before leaving." Only with extreme effort and resourcefulness could they cope.</p>
<p>Now, the situation has only worsened. One has to go to the market as early as six or seven in the morning, but it is already a sea of people. One has to force one's way into the crowd, find an opening, and use a loud voice to say, "Thank you, please give me a pound of meat!" However, the butchers, the "knife-wielders," often have hearing problems and ignore your loud calls. After repeated requests, they will give you a pound of "assorted meat," full of bones, thick skin, and fatty meat, with no option to choose. Otherwise, they will glare and curse at you, or, more politely, say, "Madam, you're lucky to get any meat at all! Humph! You want to pick and choose with price-controlled goods!"</p>
<p>Not only that, but the weight is also not up to you. Listen: "Half a pound is not sold, at least a pound. Do you want it or not?"</p>
<p>Tamed like lambs, you must allow them to weigh the meat, calculate the amount precisely, and submit the money, because the "knife-wielder" has already announced loudly, "Have your money ready, no change given!"</p>
<p>The most people buy meat, because vegetables are not much cheaper than meat, and adding oil makes them equivalent to the price of meat. But the butcher's fierce face and harsh tone are truly unbearable. However, their faces are two-sided. If you are willing to pay a "black market price" or buy in large quantities for a restaurant, they will greet you with a smile and say, "I'll deliver it to you later!"—This is the origin of the man-made meat shortage.</p>
<p>As for going to the market later, most of the meat stalls are already "empty in nine out of ten places." Half a pig's head and a strip of muscle remain lonely decorations on the market shelves. The fish buckets are filled with muddy water! Only a few piles of cat food remain on the fish board! Turning to buy eggs, you find only duck eggs. They say there's no profit in selling chicken eggs at the controlled price, and you can only get chicken eggs delivered to your door (of course, not at the controlled price), but they won't deliver a small amount. So, you silently pick a few duck eggs and put them in your basket, considering it a complete menu for the day.</p>
<p>In the past, if pork was unavailable, beef was still available. But these days, even beef is quickly sold out if you are late. The vegetable stalls also have many empty baskets. The controlled prices of various vegetables are not actually lower than the original prices, but there are fewer and fewer vegetables, with no room to pick and choose. Bean curd is made smaller and smaller. If you complain about the size, the answer is blunt: "Don't buy it, then!"</p>
<p>Buying vegetables! Buying vegetables! What vegetables to buy!</p>

<p>— Yan Zhi</p>
<p>We all know that pigeons can fly home from far away, but we don't know that wild deer are also unwilling to leave their native land.</p>
<p>Not long ago, a batch of Scottish deer was transported to distant New Zealand. Not long after arriving, several of them suddenly escaped, disappearing without a trace. A few days later, they were discovered in the turbulent ocean, bravely swimming towards their homeland. They were actually 13,000 miles from home, and had to cross the vast Pacific and Atlantic Oceans!</p>
<h3 id="e95">Advertisement <a href="#e95" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c95" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">95</a></h3>
<p>— Yuan Yi</p>
<p>With the development of commerce, the advertising industry must also develop. In the past, poets lamented the excessive advertising in this era, fearing that it would corrupt people's hearts. However, this "trend" actually began when Watt invented the steam engine.</p>
<p>Advertising, like everything else, is constantly evolving. We are amazed by the dazzling aerial advertisements in the bustling cities of America, but I believe that the advertisements in American newspapers and magazines are particularly noteworthy because the fundamental principles of their handling differ greatly from those of the past. In this respect, there may be something to learn from.</p>
<p>First, American advertisements are reducing broad and vague "tall tales" and paying more attention to the substance of the goods themselves. While they still focus on "hiding the bad and promoting the good," they are gradually reducing the "making something out of nothing" component. For example, advertisements for daily necessities often have a small oval stamp that reads, "Guaranteed by the 'Household Affairs' magazine. If the advertisement is inaccurate, a refund or exchange is guaranteed." This undoubtedly attracts many customers who are tired of "tall tale" advertisements. Advertisements for certain medical devices often have a shield-shaped mark that reads, "Approved by the American Medical Association Physical Therapy Association." This, of course, also enhances the confidence of patients. There are so many advertisements for Chinese patent medicines in our country. I think the latter is particularly worth emulating.</p>
<p>Second, the production of advertisements themselves has greatly improved. They pay attention to the specific readership of each publication, striving to suit their tastes, so that the overall style of the publication is not adversely affected by poor advertising copy.</p>
<p>Third, more pictures and fewer words. This is also a kind of progress. Sometimes, when there are more words than pictures, it is often to introduce a piece of common knowledge that everyone does not dislike in a relaxed and witty tone (such as insurance company advertisements talking about the signs of high blood pressure and the prevention of strokes, telephone companies explaining how to make a phone call, etc.).</p>
<p>The United States also uses advertisements to recruit soldiers, and their production is extremely sophisticated, showing the government's emphasis on this. Advertising merchants in our country have made considerable progress in recent years, but if they want to keep up with the times, it seems that they should continue to work hard.</p>

<h3 id="e99">"Contacting the Dead" in America <a href="#e99" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c99" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">99</a></h3>
<p>— Yan Bo</p>
<p>There is a "spiritualist" named Pike in Chicago, USA, who is famous for being good at "contacting the dead." His door is always crowded, and business is booming. One day, a woman with red, tear-filled eyes came, wearing a newly bought mourning dress, and asked Pike to help her, so that she could talk to her recently deceased husband.</p>
<p>Pike closed his eyes, moaned for a long time, and said, "I see a man. Yes, he is your husband. He says he is very happy, but he can't bear to leave you. He is leaving. He tells you not to be sad, and says that if you miss him, just come here to contact the dead. I'm sorry, the fee for contacting the dead is one dollar."</p>
<p>The woman began to cry. She sobbed and said, "How could he have already left? I still have things to say! What should be done with the three thousand dollars he left behind?"</p>
<p>The "spiritualist's" facial expression immediately became tense. "Let me try to find him again, don't worry."</p>
<p>He closed his eyes again, intoxicated for a while, and said, "I have found your husband again. He says that this money is for you to do business. He tells you to invest in—"</p>
<p>He seemed to be in great pain, and the muscles on his face twitched convulsively. He said:</p>
<p>"Your husband tells you to invest in a Wilcox Transportation Company at 1159 Meimu Street. He says that this company is prosperous and that if you deposit one thousand dollars this year, you can earn more than five thousand dollars within two years."</p>
<p>The woman's tears flowed again. She said gratefully, "Mr. Pike, I don't know how to repay you."</p>
<p>There was indeed a certain Wilcox at 1159 Meimu Street. He had already learned from Pike that he would receive a good business deal, so when the female customer arrived, he cheerfully did everything he could to entertain her, and the female customer followed Wilcox's words and started a transportation business.</p>
<p>However, Pike and Wilcox's joy turned to sorrow. Suddenly, the female customer accused them of colluding to defraud her, and the evidence was conclusive. The two men had no way to deny it and had to go to jail—</p>
<p>This female customer's real name is Rose McGunnegle. She was never married. Where did she get a recently deceased husband! For twenty years, Miss McGunnegle has specialized in fighting against those swindlers who live off the dead ancestors. She said that in the major cities of New York, Chicago, and Los Angeles, the money sent to these swindlers each year is at least more than one million dollars, and if the whole country is considered, then the annual cost in this area is probably more than one hundred million dollars.</p>
<p>She has always cooperated with the courts or the police. She often disguises herself as a farmer, a maid, a wealthy lady, especially a widow, because she says that widows are the easiest to be "fooled by those" swindlers.</p>
<p>Once, the wife of a wealthy man invited Miss McGunnegle to visit. It turned out that the man was extremely superstitious and believed very much in the words of a "spiritualist." The "spiritualist" said that his financial fortune was very good and told him to bet on "number five" on the roulette table, and he would definitely win big. The wealthy man was overjoyed and immediately followed his instructions! As a result, he lost eight thousand dollars!</p>
<p>But the wealthy man still deeply believed in the "spiritualist" and went to find him again. At that time, McGunnegle brought an assistant and had already arrived, but did not come forward.</p>
<p>The wealthy man brought another three thousand dollars to the casino, but McGunnegle had already overheard the "spiritualist" making a phone call to the casino boss! Moreover, she recorded the conversation between these two people!</p>
<p>McGunnegle and the wealthy man's wife found the wealthy man in the lounge of the casino and played the recording for him to hear. But listening to the "spiritualist" said: "This guy is not suspicious at all. It is amazing that he can even do business! I think he is simply like a child, who doesn't understand anything, maybe even dumber than a child!"</p>
<p>The wealthy man was ashamed and angry, his face flushed red, and admitted that he had been deceived, but he absolutely refused to accuse the two swindlers. He exclaimed: "What! Am I supposed to go to court to hear them play this recording? Wouldn't that make me the laughingstock of the whole city!"</p>
<p>No true and honest ghost has ever said to those who "contact the dead," "Be careful, McGunnegle is here to make trouble." Therefore, McGunnegle has not yet encountered failure.</p>

<p>Hollywood's red female star Marlene Dietrich still has a reputation for beauty today, turning countless audiences upside down, but in fact she is already a grandmother! Her beauty is ageless, comparable to our Dr. Mei Lanfang.</p>
<p>There are many people in the United States who have the same last name and first name. Recently, the Veterans Administration sorted out the list of veterans after World War II and found 225,000 people with the last name Smith, including 12,000 people named John Smith and another 12,000 people named William Smith. In addition, 9,000 people are named William Brown. When Shanghai previously conducted a census, dozens of Wu Guozhen were found (recently, one was sentenced to life imprisonment). Compared with these Smiths and Browns, it is quite a small comparison to a large one.</p>
<p>On Mount Thunderhead in South Dakota, USA, work has recently begun on carving an unparalleled large stone statue. This is a memorial statue of the Native American Indian "Chief Crazy Horse," reaching a height of four hundred feet.</p>

<p>— Wu Yong</p>
<p>Reading does not necessarily have to focus on what it says or what its subject matter is. What is important is to look at its spirit and charm, observe its style, examine its methods of learning, and emulate its spirit of diligence. Content and subject matter refer to things and objects, which are dead. Spirit, charm, method, and spirit refer to the person who wrote the article, which is alive.</p>
<p>A truly knowledgeable and eloquent person's writing has the force of overturning mountains and seas, with sights too numerous to behold, making people admire it and stand in awe, lamenting their own inferiority, and thus feeling a sense of "looking up to a high mountain and following a noble path." The same topic, written by another person, may not be so impressive. The reason why most people read a book is only because the author is a famous writer, and few read it because they feel that the topic or book title is interesting.</p>
<p>For example, Hu Shi on textual research, Chen Yinke on classics and history, Wang Guowei on Song and Yuan opera, Lin Yutang on Su Dongpo's biography. I personally do not feel any interest in these topics, but reading them turns out to be full of interest, and I am reluctant to put them down. This is because I am moved by the author, because I love his spirit and charm and admire his method and spirit.</p>
<p>In fact, any truly knowledgeable and eloquent person, even if writing on a topic that is incomprehensible to the general public, can still make them understand it and develop a strong interest in it. The reason why he can make people understand and develop an interest is also because of his spirit, charm, method, and spirit, not because of the content of the work or the topic.</p>
