<h3 id="c1">發展進出口貿易的我見 <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>自八一九經濟改革以後，進出口貿易便一落千丈，自限價制度放棄以後，進出口貿易更是絕無僅有，王前財長對於整個的經濟政策，並沒有統盤的計劃，也沒有合乎情理和適應環境的方案·別的不說，祗說進出口貿易吧，在整套方案中，對於進口貿易祗是减少限額這一着，而於出口貿易亦祇有榨取的一途。他祗知增加外滙的收入和减少外滙的支出以增加國富，而不知把外滙如何運用以福國利民，這樣的方案，不但不能適應環境，而且違反經濟原則，其改革方案的失敗，祗是自然的結果·</p>
<p>現在徐財長上台，把金銀滙率再作一度的調整，這不能不說是適應環境的適當措置。他似是　一個現實主義者，繼調整金銀滙率辦法之後，對於鼓勵進出口貿易，想必有合乎情理和適應環境的妥善辦法·當此整個經濟方案尙未修正之前，我要貢獻一些意見，以作政府亡羊補牢的參考·</p>
<p>一，首先應該撤消輸出入管理委員會，以袪除發展進出口貿易的障礙·過去和現行的限額分配和輸出結滙制度，是極不公允的，是多此一舉的，是阻礙進出口貿易的發展的。進口祗限於必需品，原是對的·可是嚴訂限額和准許結滙的後果，就給特殊階級的中外商人以發財的機會，而使生產者受到無窮的剝削。因爲必需原料的進口，旣有限額，則配到限額的人，就是奇貨可居。雖政府准許結滙，但商人豈肯依照結滙的價格讓售於生產者？如果凡是生產原料的進口不加限制，那原料的進口不是增多了嗎？供應增加，物價就可穩定，自不致爲少數的進口商所操縱了·至於出口一層，應毫無疑義地加以哉勵，這不單是爲出口商着想，而是爲生產的農民着想。輸出品所得的外滙，要照政府所規定的滙率結滙交與政府，出口商够不到成本，當然停止進行，農民的產品更沒有出路，就有破產的危險，如果沒有輸出結匯的辦法，出口商就可收其輸出所得的外匯換回政府所核准的進口品，豈非一舉兩得？政府若爲收益起見，出口雖沒有稅，但在產區和運轉之間，種種負担，並不算輕，何必再有輸出入管理委員會以管理其事？所以我說輸出入管理委員會是不公允的，多此一舉的，阻礙進出口貿易的發展的。</p>
<p>二，政府對于進出口貿易所需和所得的外滙不必加以管制。政府對于進口貿易所需的外滙不必盡供給的義務，而對於出口貿易所得的外滙，也不應加以攫奪。進口所需的外滙，商人運用自備外滙也好，利用出口所得的外滙，也好祗要商人能自己取給，以輸入政府所核定的進口品，政府就不必加以過問。政府爲了適合現實的環境，最好不再由中央銀行揭示有名無實的外滙掛牌。若爲吸收僑滙，不如交由中國銀行專做外滙的買賣，跟着市况而爲機動性的調整，如此辦理，亦不患無隨時吸收的機會。</p>
<p>三，鼓勵出口應是政府的責任。現在出口商人要做出口貿易，所需鉅大的資金如何籌措，實是極大的問題。法幣由三百萬元，折合爲金圓一元，現在再一貶値而爲五分之一，人民的財富，幾爲政府搜括殆盡，而出口的農產品，則以成本增高，其價格也隨之而高。如果不想法去大量收買，難免要貨棄于地，加速農村的崩潰。若要設法收買，則商人又無此偌大資金，所以放寬一切出口貸款，在政府是無可推諉的。須知要進出口貿易連鎖制的順利推行，非先使出口貿易有發展的機會不可。</p>
<p>總之，發展進出口貿易，爲維持整個社會經濟重要的一環。過去限制過于嚴密，政府祗知收入，不知調節，祗知剝削，不知扶助，致弄成今日這樣癱瘓的局面，現在直偪處此，已至非完全開放不可的地步。政府何不爽爽快快地來個急轉直下的改變呢！</p>

<p>中央銀行各局處負責人，昨舉行重要會議，經審定根據修正金圓券發行辦法後兌換金銀實施細則，並決卽送財部核定實施。</p>
<p>據悉：金銀及外幣之兌換，可望於本月二十二日開始，並同時接受一年之存款，所有金銀兌換業務，並已委託中國·農民·交通·三行協同兌換。聞央行庫存黃金，將於日內撥交中央造幣廠，鑄成金圓及小金條，以便兌換。</p>
<p>據當局表示：此一改變金圓券爲兌換本位制，乃修正辦法中最重要之一，此舉可使洗通市面之大量金圓券回籠，穩定金圓券之法定價，而使物價下跌。</p>
<p>又訊：自政府宣佈金圓券兌換金幣後，本市各方對於當局此項措置，均極重視·金融當局人士稱：政府宣佈金圓券得十足兌現後，對金銀外幣黃金黑市之消滅，有極大帮助，彼指出今後之黃金黑市，因政府准予十足兌付之故，已難越過二千元，上落幅度旣狹，則暴利之求得便較困難。一般冒險之徒，自將因而放棄其違法交易·至於本市一般人士對此次政府所公佈之辦法中，對金圓券之發行數量，規定以命令變更一點，當局認爲亦無憂慮之必要。據新自南京返滬之央行某負責人稱：政府對金圓券發行，決仍維持十足準備。</p>

<p>食米昨日各路來貨源源湧到，北站附近單帮米沿街呌賣，白粳在四百元一石可賣到，連日無錫產地米價，已跌進三關，各方對食米尚繼續看低。</p>
<p>昨日到埠食米甚夥，兩市塲白粳高貨做四百二十元，薄稻四百二十元，早稻三百七十元，羊秈三百九十元。</p>
<p>麵粉市塲，昨日交易極旺，以糧食商人對米價把握無定，而粉價尚屬平定，故大多轉移目標，將游資購買麵粉，故昨日粉市，呈先疲後堅之勢。兵船粉開一二〇元，收市升至一二五元，與上週六軋平。老車以納胃旺盛，開市一二〇元，收市升至一三〇元，較上週末上升七元，其他麵粉後市均作升勢，麩皮亦升，福新大包九三元。</p>
<p>雜糧做開亦旺，漲跌互見。黃豆下挫，鄱陽子豆一六〇元，苞米上漲二十元，生仁１芝蔴·平定。</p>
<p>食油交易尙旺，市况參差，生油本廠開九六〇元，江北淨生油一〇四〇元，較上週六下挫六〇元，生菜油五八〇元，下挫二〇元，熟菜油平定，吉桶小車七五〇元，本廠豆油初開七〇〇元，以業內銀根轉鬆，後市轉挺至七二〇元，市價與上週六軋平。</p>

<p>昨日茶市頭寸雖仍見緊，但執戶鑒於各貸稀少售意咸不稍鬆，惟外銷箱茶因國外出價尚緊，輸出商依然靜待，過程岑寂。至於國內各地內銷，續未隱匿，故買氣絡繹，市勢活潑，行情秀色。</p>

<p>捲姻市況重見挺秀，各姻一致喊高，蓋因銀根轉鬆，納胃增強，加以門莊去化暢吒，補吸不乏。華商各姻原已跌至廠盤者，均己回昂四·五元，頤中姻亦漲一成至二成間，一般看法，以爲捲姻目下正當暢銷季節，如若銀根機續鬆弛，前途尚須看好。</p>
<p>日用品肥皂及火柴，亦見昂秀，固本每箱漲四十元餘，箭刀升五十元，黃祥茂每箱喊二百六十元有成交，火柴平穩，美麗火柴仍喊二千六百元。</p>

<p>記者爲明瞭巴國本年度棉花出口情況，及我國配額之可能增加數量，昨晨會走訪新自巴國返滬之本市棉業鉅子趙斐君氏，據趙氏稱：本年度巴圖可供出口之原棉，總額約一百三十萬包，目前配　雖已大致確定，惟我政府如能及時爭取，則徐原配額一萬五千包外，再塲五萬包，當極有可能。且巴方供給印度政府之六十五萬包內，規定於明年一”底前，印方必須購取率數，如印方於此期內，不能購取半數，則其所剩原棉，巴方得自由處置，故我國如爭取得法，超過五萬包，亦非絕不可能。</p>
<p>趙氏並指出，此一問題，其重要性，並不在於本年度配額之增加，而在於今後原棉之供應，與巴國紗布市塲之爭取。彼謂：巴國一萬萬人口中，僅有紗錠五萬錠，故每年紗布之輸入，幾佔該國進口貨之第一位，此大好市塲，目下日本紡織業正躍躍欲試，我國朝野如何爭取時機，誠爲值得研究之問題。</p>

<h3 id="c110">記黃百韜將軍 <a href="#c110" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e110" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">110</a></h3>
<p>— 宋人英</p>
<p>中原會戰時期功績最偉大　今徐州會戰又獲輝煌戰果</p>
<p>黃百韜將軍，字煥然，河北人，爲人沉默謙和，有懦將風度，當代的模範軍人，他可當之無愧，在夏季中原會戰中，他建立功勛最大，蔣總統曾以最崇高的靑天白日大勳章嘉獎他，並親自佩在他的胸口，今徐州會戰，黃氏祖任東翼總指揮，血戰六晝夜，已殲滅敵方四萬六千餘人，諒不久的將來，必可大獲全勝。</p>
<p>黃將軍幼時，卽有大志·在小學讀書時，嘗命小朋友學習兵操，並說我們今日操練好了，將來可以打倒侵略我們的外國人，他在指揮小朋友時，對於進退襲撃攻打等戰術，莫不井井有條，他的老師等見到他這種作爲，都嘖嘖稱奇，一致嘉獎，並贈他一個小黃忠將軍的頭銜。</p>
<p>黃將軍治軍雖嚴，但對待兵士極優，在訓練兵將時，對於各種戰鬥技術，常親自考驗，絕不放一個人敷衍了事或濫竽充數，士兵的飲食起居，也一律平等，無高下之分，對於部屬的有功於兵團者，或公而忘私者，尤特別尊之重之勉之獎之，他的軍隊所到之處，秋毫無犯，雞犬不驚，地方人士莫不担持壺漿以迎王道之師，他行軍神速，戰鬥力亦非常强大，上次中原會戰中，當洛陽等處正在萬分危急之時，他的部隊尙駐防在蘇北一帶，後接奉上峯救援命令，卽於當日起營拔寨，並限部下日時，到達某地，那時敵方正在戰事非常得意之際，萬料不到半夜義殺出來一支黃家軍，竟被打得落花流水，望風而遁，黃氏見戰事已吿勝利，私心稍慰，惟見到戰塲上屍橫遍野，血流成渠那種慘狀，則又不禁放聲大哭，涕淚交下，黃氏常常希望共黨放下屠刀，救救國家，救救人民，更望共黨犧牲小我，顧全大我，各方團結，共同復興中華。</p>
<p>黃氏的家庭，毫無時下要人們的闊綽氣燄，可比曾文正公家庭的勸儉樸實，筆者前日因事到黃府，見黃夫人身穿一件破舊衣服，正在家中治理雜務，黃夫人賢良有名，敎子有方，長公子効先，上半年曾問學於不才，今在海軍學校肄業，品學俱佳，將來亦大有希望也。</p>
<h3 id="c111">隴東萬象 <a href="#c111" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e111" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">111</a></h3>
<p>— 本報記者　宋麟</p>
<p>〔本報西峯鎭十日航訊〕有人說過，由於歷史地理和人文的巧合，隴東在甘肅的地位，宛如東九省之於中國，而隴東司令台的西峯鎭，自然該算是甘肅的瀋陽了。</p>
<p>在軍政設施上，西峯鎭總綰着隴東九縣的重心，也做了大西北的半個屏障，匪軍歷年垂涎的結果，引起今年春天的隴東殲滅戰，在剿匪史上占着光輝的一頁。會戰以後遺留下的戰鬥痕跡，今天還可隱約辨認，但匪軍播下的許多罪惡的種籽——匪諜以及潛伏的零星武力，至今尙未完全肅淸。</p>
<p>地方政府在「破壞中求安定，安定中求建設」的原則下，展開當前急要的淸鄕與撫慰工作，保甲，賬濟，等施政，與日俱進，在各縣的每一角落發酵，人民和政府有着共同的願望：安定，建設。　山國中的西峯鎭，也難逃金圓券浪潮的敲擊，當隴東會戰時，這兒雖飽受驚恐，但會戰甫畢，馬上又恢復到</p>
<p>金融經濟中心的地位。「八一九」新經濟改革後，經管機構遲涅遲未能建立，商民起初是觀望，後來開始投機，兩月以來，物價無日不在上漲，雖然沒有「限價」等措施，也一樣的「有行無市」。硬幣在隴東仍有極堅强的陣容，隨時興風作浪，使每斗小麥由法幣三百餘萬元起已翻過兩三個觔斗，其他的貨物自然也水漲船高。而接近匪區的日用品，因匪方以更高的代價在搜求，無知的人民在利慾的引誘下，有不少人上勾</p>
<p>隴東外貎是單純，簡樸，而勞動的。在深秋的煦陽下，郊野的農物作　收豁了，赭色的泥土也經過耕耘，散播着大地的芬芳，牛車拖着金黃的麥稭，迂緩的運到打麥塲上去，麥塲上的農民更加緊在輾麥，只有穿着襤褸的老農，噙着用牛骨頭做成的旱烟嘴，在黃　蕭瑟的村莊前晒太陽。</p>
<p>但隴東仍擺不開陳腐與破敗的桎梏，滬裏的人民在害一種文化的貧血症，新聞紙在這裏已成爲奢侈的享受，只有極小數人能接觸到她。一般的人民，對時事異常生疎。「新隴報」間日一出，篇幅狹小，印刷糢糊，內容及編排，均貧乏而呆板。只有當地駐軍每天聽收音機後，抄下幾則簡訊貼出去，這短短的幾十個字裏，能吿訴人一些什麼呢？「哦，原來有這麼「椿事呀！」這是我耳聞的。</p>
<p>在省政當局經濟·文化·衛生。自衛</p>
<p>四大建設的號召下，隴東各縣已在集中大半的精力於自衛建設，這自然是出於事實上的迫切要求。隴東各縣的地方自衛武九，是經過長的時間，實地的作戰經騐，一點一滴建立起來的，在隴東會戰時已有過不可磨滅的功績，但在那次會戰中，它也暴露了互不協調，各自爲戰的弱點，政府爲珍視這批與共匪轉戰兩年的實力，曾更翻調訓自衛幹部，着重戰鬥技術的啓示，月前又奉令將保安一·三兩團及騎兵一·二·三中隊，改編爲新廿九旅，由省保安副司令陳倬調任旅長。目前該旅的編制，武器，裝備以及待遇等，都提高至國軍整編部隊的水凖，以各該團隊戰鬥精神的充沛，過去戰果的輝煌，預料今後當可形成一支保衛西北的勁旅。</p>

<h3 id="e1">My Views on Developing Import and Export Trade <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>Since the economic reforms of August 19th, import and export trade has plummeted. After the abandonment of the price control system, import and export trade has become almost nonexistent. The former Finance Minister Wang lacked a comprehensive plan for the overall economic policy, nor did he have reasonable and adaptable solutions. Speaking only of import and export trade, his entire plan only focused on reducing import quotas, and the only approach to export trade was to squeeze it dry. He only knew how to increase foreign exchange earnings and reduce foreign exchange expenditures to increase national wealth, without knowing how to use foreign exchange to benefit the country and its people. Such a plan not only failed to adapt to the environment but also violated economic principles, and the failure of his reform plan was only a natural result.</p>
<p>Now that Finance Minister Xu has taken office and made another adjustment to the gold and silver exchange rates, this cannot be said to be an appropriate measure to adapt to the environment. He seems to be a realist. Following the adjustment of the gold and silver exchange rate, he must have proper measures that are reasonable and adaptable to the environment to encourage import and export trade. Before the entire economic plan is revised, I want to offer some suggestions as a reference for the government to learn from its mistakes.</p>
<p>1.  First of all, the Import and Export Management Committee should be abolished to remove obstacles to the development of import and export trade. The past and current quota allocation and export foreign exchange settlement system are extremely unfair, superfluous, and hinder the development of import and export trade. It is correct to limit imports to necessities. However, the consequences of strictly setting quotas and allowing foreign exchange settlements give special classes of Chinese and foreign merchants the opportunity to make a fortune, while producers are subjected to endless exploitation. Because the import of essential raw materials is limited by quotas, those who are allocated quotas can hoard goods for profit. Although the government allows foreign exchange settlements, are merchants willing to sell to producers at the settlement price? If there are no restrictions on the import of all production raw materials, wouldn't the import of raw materials increase? As supply increases, prices can be stabilized, and they will not be manipulated by a small number of importers. As for the export level, it should be encouraged without a doubt. This is not only for the sake of exporters but also for the sake of farmers who produce. The foreign exchange earned from exports must be settled with the government at the exchange rate stipulated by the government. If exporters cannot reach their costs, they will naturally stop trading, and farmers' products will have no outlet, leading to the risk of bankruptcy. If there is no export foreign exchange settlement method, exporters can use the foreign exchange earned from exports to exchange for import goods approved by the government, wouldn't that be killing two birds with one stone? If the government is for the sake of revenue, although there is no tax on exports, there are various burdens in the production area and during transportation, which are not light. Why should there be an Import and Export Management Committee to manage it? Therefore, I say that the Import and Export Management Committee is unfair, superfluous, and hinders the development of import and export trade.</p>
<p>2.  The government should not control the foreign exchange required and obtained for import and export trade. The government does not have the obligation to supply all the foreign exchange required for import trade, nor should it seize the foreign exchange obtained from export trade. Whether merchants use their own foreign exchange or use the foreign exchange obtained from exports for the foreign exchange required for imports, as long as merchants can provide for themselves to import goods approved by the government, the government does not need to interfere. In order to adapt to the real environment, it is best for the government not to issue a nominal foreign exchange listing by the Central Bank. If it is to absorb overseas remittances, it is better to hand it over to the Bank of China to specialize in foreign exchange trading, making flexible adjustments according to market conditions. If this is done, there will be no lack of opportunities to absorb them at any time.</p>
<p>3.  Encouraging exports should be the responsibility of the government. Now, the huge capital required for export merchants to do export trade is a huge problem. The legal tender has been converted from 3 million yuan to 1 gold yuan, and now it has been devalued to one-fifth. The people's wealth has been almost completely plundered by the government, and the cost of exported agricultural products has increased, and their prices have also increased accordingly. If we don't find a way to buy them in large quantities, it is inevitable that the goods will be discarded on the ground, accelerating the collapse of rural areas. If we want to find a way to buy them, merchants do not have such large funds, so it is the government's undeniable responsibility to relax all export loans. It must be known that in order to smoothly promote the chain system of import and export trade, the opportunity for export trade to develop must first be created.</p>
<p>In short, the development of import and export trade is an important part of maintaining the entire social economy. In the past, restrictions were too strict. The government only knew how to collect revenue, not to regulate, only to exploit, not to support, resulting in the current paralyzed situation. Now we are directly forced into this situation, and it has reached the point where it must be completely opened up. Why doesn't the government make a quick and decisive change?</p>
<h3 id="e2">Standards Determined by the Legislative Yuan Financial and Economic Committee Group for Clearing Pre-War Deposits and Loans <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 15th] The Legislative Yuan Financial and Economic Committee group held a secret meeting on the morning of the 15th to preliminarily review and amend the standards for clearing pre-war loans. The clearance standards for fixed-term deposits and loans were determined according to the period of deposit and loan as follows: (1) Deposits before August 13, 1937, will be repaid at the principal plus interest plus 100%. (2) From August 13th to the end of 1938, an interest rate of 80% will be added. (3) 1939 plus 60%. (4) 1940 plus 40%. (5) 1941 plus 20%. The clearance standard for current deposits and loans shall be calculated at half. The ratio of conversion to gold yuan will be divided into three levels according to the principle of "more for small amounts, less for large amounts": The first level is below 2,000 yuan, with each yuan of legal tender converted to 3 gold yuan; the second level is from 2,000 yuan to 5,000 yuan, with each yuan converted to 2 yuan; the third level is above 5,000 yuan, with each yuan converted to 1 yuan.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 15th] The Legislative Yuan's Economic and Resources Committee held a preliminary review meeting at 3:00 PM on the 15th. Nine members including Qiu Zhisheng attended, with Liu Youchen chairing. The committee reviewed the "Proposal to Immediately Consult the Government to Strictly Abide by the Constitutional Provisions Concerning the National Economy, Revise the Current Tax Law, Prevent Illegal Profits, Eradicate Illegal Harassment, So As to Win People's Hearts and Avert Crisis in Order to Implement Comprehensive Economic Reform, Support Agricultural and Industrial Production, Facilitate Commercial Travel, Increase National Treasury Revenue, and Reduce the Burden on Common People, and Achieve Equal Distribution of Social Wealth" proposed by members Qiu Hanping and others. After two hours of discussion, the results were: (1) The part concerning land will be handled in conjunction with the Land Reform Law. (2) The part concerning private wealth, private enterprises, and taxation will be sent to relevant government departments for reference. (3) The part concerning finance was temporarily postponed for discussion due to its loss of timeliness.</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 15th] The Democratic Freedom Society organized by legislators held its third general meeting of members at the Overseas Chinese Guest House at 3:00 PM on the 15th. More than 120 people attended. Chen Kewen, Zhang Qianhua, and Wang Zemin served as chairmen. After reporting on society affairs and military affairs, they discussed issues related to the current situation and resolved important matters as follows: (1) The Executive Yuan should be fully responsible for the last currency reform. (2) The method for issuing gold yuan coupons should be revised, and strict precautions should be taken to prevent wealthy families and magnates from taking advantage of the opportunity to make profits. A considerable amount should be allocated from the gold, silver, and foreign currencies collected to handle the fair-price supply of food, cloth, cooking oil, coal, and other daily necessities, and to organize large-scale refugee relief and winter relief. (3) The treatment of public educators, civil servants, and soldiers should be increased in proportion to the devaluation of the gold yuan coupon. (4) The temporary property tax should be implemented as soon as possible, and the government should requisition foreign exchange from or apportion public bonds to a small number of wealthy families and magnates who are publicly known throughout the country. (5) Investigate wealthy businessmen who hoard materials and officials who purchase foreign currencies. (6) Local officials in various places who fail to prevent rice-grabbing riots and maintain local order should be punished. (7) Personnel residing overseas without public duties should be recalled as soon as possible. In addition, issues related to diplomacy and the current political system were also discussed.</p>

<p>[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 15th Electric] The Chairman of the Security Council, Argentine Foreign Minister Bramuglia, and representatives of the six neutral countries continue to review the Berlin issue in order to find a solution to the problem within the scope of the Security Council. According to well-informed sources in the United States, the 17th may be the date when the United Kingdom, the United States, and France will respond to the proposals of Evatt and Lie. However, to date, there is no sign of when the Soviet Union will respond.</p>
<p>[United Press, Paris, 15th Electric] Well-informed sources said today that US Secretary of State Marshall will respond on behalf of President Truman to the peace telegrams from UN General Assembly President Evatt and UN Secretary-General Lie. Marshall will do so after full consultations with the foreign ministers of the United Kingdom and France. Marshall, British Undersecretary McNeil, and French Foreign Minister Schuman will meet on the 16th, at which time they will at least exchange views on the telegrams, and each stage of the consultation will be telegraphed to President Truman.</p>
<p>[United Press, Moscow, 14th Electric] Senior diplomatic officials here tonight said that Premier Stalin is likely to give an affirmative reply to the United Nations leaders' proposal for the four countries to negotiate the Berlin issue. Although Soviet newspapers have not published the telegrams sent by UN General Assembly President Evatt and UN Secretary-General Lie to the heads of the four countries, foreign diplomats observing Soviet policy predict that the Soviet Union will respond soon. They believe that the Soviet Union will certainly have its own opinions on the time and place of the meeting, but it will not be difficult for the Soviet representatives to agree on this at this time in the four-power meeting. Although Stalin is not currently in Moscow, this is not an obstacle to holding the meeting. If the four-power heads of administration meeting agrees to be held, Stalin may shorten his vacation. Foreign observers believe that the Soviet Union is very willing to hold high-level meetings on important world issues, and its attention to this plan has been going on for some time. Therefore, if the meeting is realized, the Soviet government will not only discuss the Berlin dispute, but also intends to discuss all outstanding issues between East and West, including the German-Japanese peace treaty.</p>
<p>[United Press, Paris, 14th Electric] United Nations officials said informally today that they hope that Premier Stalin will immediately agree to the peace appeal of UN General Assembly President Evatt and the two UN leaders. The question is how President Truman will respond. Evatt and Lie asked the heads of the four countries to personally meet to resolve the Berlin issue. This direct negotiation method has always been opposed by Truman, but the moral force of the United Nations may change Truman's original intention.</p>

The plan will also force the Arab and Jewish sides to formally conclude a peace treaty. However, the success or failure of the Bernadotte plan depends on the attitude of the United States. US officials said that they do not intend to speak at the moment and will have to wait for another day. The General Assembly has taken action to ensure that the debate on the Holy Land issue will begin immediately and avoid delays that lead to repetition.

<h3 id="e27">Atlantic Treaty <a href="#e27" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c27" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">27</a></h3>
<p>Will Not Be Completed Before February of Next Year</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 14th Associated Press Electric] US officials expect that the planned North Atlantic Security Treaty will not be submitted to the Senate for approval until early February of next year, but they hope to submit it after the new Congress opens in January. This treaty will integrate the defense of the United States, Canada, and Western European countries into a system of common resistance to aggression. According to the designers of this treaty, the factors that move the timetable backward are: (1) the postponement of the resumption of the preliminary meeting after the ambassadors of the five European countries held meetings with other countries; (2) the final drafting meeting may take several weeks, and in each process, consultations will be held with President Truman and congressional leaders. State Department officials hope that the ambassadors of the five countries can again hold talks with Acting Secretary of State Lovett this week. One of the major issues to be discussed is whether to invite countries such as Denmark, Norway, Portugal, Italy, Ireland, and Iceland to be signatories to the above treaty. However, the Italian peace treaty will make Italy's cooperation impossible.</p>

If so, it will be necessary to mobilize 15 million Americans, making it the largest in world history. The defense plan will be promoted by each state, but the National Civil Defense Bureau will assist and guide.</p>

<p>[United Press, Paris, 14th Electric] The French government's position has been temporarily stabilized today. The Queuille cabinet was originally precarious under the attacks of the de Gaulle faction and the Communist Party. The decision of the United Kingdom and the United States to hand over the Ruhr coal and steel industry to the Germans for management has dealt it a new blow. However, the People's Republican Party and the Socialist Party, the backbone of the cabinet, held separate meetings today and decided that the ministers of the two parties would remain in office temporarily. However, for each proposal, the Socialist Party requires Queuille to guarantee to suppress prices or increase wages within two months, and also requires a 25% reduction in military spending. The People's Republican Party requires Queuille to implement a financial, economic, and social policy of equal burden.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 14th Electric] The Socialist Party's National Congress convened in Paris today, calling on the nation's "third force" to unite, formulate a new economic plan, stabilize prices, and consolidate the "French Republic." The Congress decided to notify Prime Minister Queuille of the Socialist Party's economic proposals.

<p>It is also learned that because Emperor Hirohito has not been prosecuted by the court, some Allied countries will insist on commuting the sentences of the criminals when MacArthur seeks opinions from various countries on the 20th.

At 9:00 PM, more than 6,000 people were waiting quietly outside the palace for good news. When the police reported the good news of the birth of a prince, the crowd cheered loudly, which could be heard in the depths of the palace. The first person to learn the good news was Philip. He, along with the King and Queen of England in evening dress, were waiting in the neighboring room. The Queen immediately hugged Philip, and the King also warmly shook his hand to congratulate him. Before the delivery, Philip, like a normal anxious father, paced back and forth in the long corridor for a long time. After the doctors checked in the delivery room, they determined that both mother and child were safe. Doctors Guillebaud and Weir came out of the room together and told Philip; "It's a prince." The agency announcing this good news immediately began working. Sir Lascelles, the King's secretary, ordered the word "Prince" to be filled in on every telegram. The news was immediately broadcast everywhere within minutes. The first message reported to Queen Mary, the second message reported to Princess Margaret. The Queen Mother rushed to the palace after receiving the news. Other members of the royal family were each notified by telephone.

After careful deliberation, it was resolved that the employee living cost index for this period (the first half of November) is 8.1 times the base period (August 19th). Subsequently, due to concerns among the committee members that various manufacturers may have difficulties in disbursing wages, four methods of wage payment were specifically passed as follows: (1) Wage payment should be made in one lump sum in principle. (2) If the employer is indeed experiencing financial difficulties, half of the wages may be paid first to those with lower salaries, and the remainder must be paid to those with lower salaries no later than the 25th. (3) If the factory is experiencing financial difficulties and cannot pay wages in full, a portion of the finished products (daily necessities) may be issued, with the price calculated at the wholesale price. (4) The unified name for the index will henceforth be "Employee Living Cost Index," without distinguishing between staff and workers.</p>

<h3 id="e53">Public Utilities: Wage Payment Issues: Social Affairs Bureau Convenes Labor and Management for Discussion; Both Parties Present Their Difficulties <a href="#e53" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c53" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">53</a></h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] After the Municipal Government released the employee living index for the first half of November yesterday morning, the Social Affairs Bureau immediately convened representatives from both labor and management of the city's six major public utilities at 4:00 PM to discuss wage payment issues. Those present included Wu Kaixian, Director of the Social Affairs Bureau, Zhao Banfu, Deputy Director, Shui Xiangyun, Chairman of the General Labor Union, Li Kaidi, Consultant of the Public Utilities Bureau, and representatives from various public utility companies, for more than four hours. The labor side believed that the living index for this period was too low. In the past, monthly wages could buy three dan of rice, while the wages for this period were only worth the price of one dan of rice. At the same time, the rationing of daily necessities has not yet been issued, and after buying rice, there is no money left to buy daily necessities, so they requested that the authorities make public the content of the compilation of the index for this period. The management side also stated their difficulties, pointing out that the authorities have restricted the prices of public utilities, and the increase in the living index is now higher than the increase in the prices of public utilities. It is difficult to pay the salaries of employees for the first half of this month, but it will be more difficult in the second half of the month, so they requested that the prices of public utilities be automatically adjusted.</p>

<h3 id="e58">The Lin-Hui Brigade of Bandits in Pudong Attempted to Harass and Was Crushed; Bandit Brigade Commander and Others Were Arrested, and Weapons and Documents Were Confiscated <a href="#e58" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c58" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">58</a></h3>
<p>[Central News Agency] Commander Xuan of the Songhu Garrison Headquarters received intelligence in mid-October that Gu Hanmin's (aka Gu Xiao Changgen) unit of the Lin-Hui Brigade of Bandits in Pudong was attempting to sneak into Shanghai to harass and rob. He immediately ordered He Longqing, Director of the Investigation Division, to instruct the Garrison Brigade to instruct the Third Team Leader Yan Jinwen to be responsible for the investigation and to crack the case. After receiving the order, Team Leader Yan selected Squad Leader Zhao Zhencai and led officers Sui Wenzhi and others to Pudong to conduct an investigation and sent informants in disguise to infiltrate the bandit area. They learned that Gu was instructed by his brigade commander Zhou Genfu to send squadron leader Tan Bingsheng to lead his troops to rob Shanghai because his strength was insufficient. They also planned to purchase weapons and military supplies after obtaining funds and transport them to Pudong to replenish their strength and wait for an opportunity to launch a large-scale invasion of Shanghai. Team Leader Yan reported to Brigade Commander Xia Lian and then to Director He, and ordered the informants to return to the bandit area to track the bandits, and ordered Squad Leader Zhao in Pudong to secretly contact the informants. On October 22, the bandit Tan Bingsheng indeed led a group across the river. Squad Leader Zhao and others followed and monitored them. After Tan and his bandits arrived in Shanghai, they hid at No. 2, Ronghua Lane, Lane 457, Malang Road, while the remaining bandits were scattered in various places such as Zhaozhou Road in the South City and Haifang Road in Western Shanghai, using a certain lane in Linsen Middle Road as a central contact station. That night, Tan sent three bandits, Chen Zhixiong, Song Linsheng, and Lu Jinhai, to rob a wealthy family in Western Shanghai. Squad Leader Zhao immediately telegraphed Team Leader Yan with the location of the bandits and their planned robbery. The Garrison Team immediately dispatched personnel in batches. After Squad Leader Zhao contacted Team Leader Yan by phone, he left personnel to monitor Tan's actions and personally led Sui Wenzhi and others to follow Chen Zhixiong and other bandits to the vicinity of the Paris Theater on Linsen Middle Road, where they met Team Leader Yan and others who were ambushing there. The informants pointed out the bandits, and they suddenly stepped forward to "inspect" passersby and arrested the two bandits, Song Linsheng and Lu Jinhai. A live pistol was found on Song. The remaining bandit, Chen Zhixiong, seeing that the situation was not good, turned around and fled westward, firing backward into the crowd, injuring a passerby, Jia Shouchang (Jia works at the Huaan Department Store on Linsen Middle Road). Because the area was a bustling city with many pedestrians, Team Leader Yan strictly ordered his subordinates not to return fire but continued to pursue relentlessly. When they reached Fuxing Park, Sui Wenzhi and other members of the Garrison Team had caught up from behind, and the bandit fired again. Sui then drew his gun and returned fire, hitting the bandit in the back and capturing him. At this time, the dispatched personnel had arrested the bandit squadron commander Tan Bingsheng and successively arrested the bandit party members Zhu Baogen, Yuan Qiugen, and Xia Meijuan in a shed on Xinzhaozhou Road in the South City, arrested the bandit officer Shi Gengen at No. 292 Haifang Road in Western Shanghai, and arrested Niu Zhengbua and others on Linsen Middle Road. After interrogating them overnight, Brigade Commander Xia also led the informants to Zhangjiawan, Yangjing, Pudong, surrounded the Lin-Hui Brigade Headquarters, and arrested the bandit brigade commander Zhou Genfu and cadres Du Xincai, Xu Xiuzhang, and others, confiscating many weapons and documents, which have now been sent to the military court for interrogation. It is reported that the confiscated documents and the confessions of the prisoners contained detailed information about the strength of the Communist bandits in Pudong and their distribution. The security of Pudong can be further stabilized in the future.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 15th] According to Liang Xin News Agency: The Executive Yuan previously stipulated in the urban rationing method that the rationing rice prices for November in the three cities of Beijing, Guangzhou, and Qingdao should be approved before the 5th of this month. The price in Beijing was 40 yuan per dan, 50 yuan per dan in Guangzhou, and 35 yuan per bag of flour in Qingdao. Subsequently, the price limit was canceled, and grain prices rose more than ten times. If the distribution was carried out at the previously approved prices, the national treasury would still suffer huge losses. In order to take care of the suppression of the rebellion's finances, the government decided to abolish the aforementioned circular and re-determine the rationing prices for the six major cities of Beijing, Shanghai, Peiping, Tianjin, Guangzhou, and Qingdao together, which will be announced uniformly within days. Furthermore, Beijing is still owed 13,000 dan of rationed rice from October. The Central Cooperative Bank has now raised 10,000 dan, which will arrive in Beijing immediately. It is expected that all the rationed rice for October can be distributed by the end of this month.</p>
<p>The Economic Cooperation Administration dispatched a special plane on the 11th to rescue the grain shortage in the city, carrying gauze to Nanchang in exchange for five tons of rice.

<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Qian DaKui, the fake Vice President of the Central Reserve Bank, was accused of being a traitor. The High Court sentenced him to death on January 21, 1947. Qian refused to accept the sentence and appealed to the Supreme Court for a retrial, which was sent back for retrial. Yesterday, the High Court pronounced its judgment again, changing Qian's sentence to life imprisonment and depriving him of his civil rights for life. The reason for the judgment was that although Qian served as the fake Vice President of the Central Reserve Bank and had the crime of colluding with the enemy and disturbing finance, the president of the bank was the traitor Zhou Fohai, and all economic policies were decided by Zhou. Qian only carried out the fake orders, which is somewhat forgivable in light of the circumstances. Therefore, his death sentence was commuted and he was sentenced to life imprisonment.</p>

<h3 id="e86">Exchange of Gold and Silver Can Begin Soon; Detailed Implementation Rules Approved Yesterday <a href="#e86" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c86" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">86</a></h3>
<p>Responsible persons from various departments of the Central Bank held an important meeting yesterday, and after review, approved the detailed implementation rules for the exchange of gold and silver based on the revised Gold Yuan Coupon Issuance Regulations, and decided to submit them to the Ministry of Finance for approval and implementation.</p>
<p>It is reported that the exchange of gold and silver and foreign currencies is expected to begin on the 22nd of this month, and deposits will be accepted for one year at the same time. All gold and silver exchange businesses have been entrusted to the Bank of China, the Farmers Bank of China, and the Bank of Communications to jointly conduct the exchange. It is said that the Central Bank's gold reserves will be allocated to the Central Mint in the coming days to be cast into gold yuan coins and small gold bars for exchange.</p>
<p>According to officials, this change of the Gold Yuan Coupon to an exchange standard system is one of the most important aspects of the revised regulations. This measure can bring back a large number of Gold Yuan Coupons circulating in the market, stabilize the legal price of the Gold Yuan Coupon, and cause prices to fall.</p>
<p>Furthermore: Since the government announced the gold coin exchange of Gold Yuan Coupons, all parties in the city have attached great importance to this measure by the authorities. Financial authorities said that the government's announcement that Gold Yuan Coupons can be fully redeemed will greatly help eliminate the black market for gold, silver, and foreign currencies. They pointed out that the black market for gold in the future will hardly exceed 2,000 yuan due to the government's permission for full redemption, and with the narrow range of fluctuations, it will be more difficult to obtain exorbitant profits. Adventurers will naturally abandon their illegal transactions as a result. As for the public's concern about the government's stipulation in this announcement that the amount of Gold Yuan Coupons issued can be changed by order, the authorities believe that there is no need to worry. According to a person in charge of the Central Bank who recently returned to Shanghai from Nanjing, the government is determined to maintain full reserves for the issuance of Gold Yuan Coupons.</p>
<h3 id="e87">Grain Continues to Trend Downward as Cargo Arrives Steadily from Various Routes; White Japonica Retreats into the 400 Yuan Range <a href="#e87" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c87" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">87</a></h3>
<p>Grain cargoes arrived steadily from various routes yesterday. Street vendors near the North Station were selling grain along the street. White japonica could be sold for 400 yuan per shi (unit of dry measure). In recent days, grain prices in Wuxi production areas have fallen to the three-yuan level. All parties are still bearish on grain.</p>
<p>A large amount of grain arrived yesterday. High-quality white japonica was trading at 420 yuan in the two markets, thin rice at 420 yuan, early rice at 370 yuan, and Yangxian rice at 390 yuan.</p>
<p>The flour market was extremely active yesterday. Since grain merchants have no definite grasp on grain prices, and flour prices are still relatively stable, most have shifted their targets, using floating capital to buy flour. Therefore, the flour market yesterday showed a trend of weakening first and then strengthening. Bingchuan flour opened at 120 yuan and closed at 125 yuan, level with Saturday. Lao Che was vigorous, opening at 120 yuan and closing at 130 yuan, up 7 yuan from the end of last week. Other flour futures were also on the rise, as was bran. Fuxin large bags were 93 yuan.</p>
<p>The miscellaneous grains market was also active, with mixed gains and losses. Soybeans fell, with Poyangzi soybeans at 160 yuan. Corn rose 20 yuan. Raw peanuts and sesame were stable.</p>
<p>The edible oil market was still active, with mixed market conditions. Raw oil from this factory opened at 960 yuan, and Jiangbei pure raw oil at 1,040 yuan, down 60 yuan from the end of last Saturday. Rapeseed oil was 580 yuan, down 20 yuan. Cooked rapeseed oil was stable, with Jietong's small cars at 750 yuan. Bean oil from this factory initially opened at 700 yuan, but as credit in the industry eased, the futures price rose to 720 yuan, and the market price was level with the end of last Saturday.</p>
<p>Soybean cakes were quite vigorous, and the market price rose slightly by 5 yuan. Yu Ji soybean cakes were 70 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e88">Stable Tea Market <a href="#e88" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c88" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">88</a></h3>
<p>Although the tea market was still tight yesterday, brokers, in view of the scarcity of goods, did not relax their willingness to sell. However, due to the tight prices of export box tea abroad, exporters remained in a wait-and-see attitude, and the process was quiet. As for domestic sales across the country, they have continued to be unhidden, so the buying interest is endless, the market is lively, and the market price is beautiful.</p>
<h3 id="e89">Stable Sugar Market <a href="#e89" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c89" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">89</a></h3>
<p>The sugar market's credit eased yesterday, transactions became active, and local street merchants were very diligent in adding inventory. Brokers' sales were also active and smooth, and the market was stable. Number 45 car refined white sugar ended at 350 yuan, with fluctuations of only 5 to 10 yuan from opening to closing. Coarse sand trends were also stable, and the remaining Xinghua white and other high-quality sugars were all at the same level as last Saturday.</p>
<h3 id="e90">Cigarettes, Soap, and Matches Strengthen <a href="#e90" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c90" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">90</a></h3>
<p>The cigarette market reappeared strong and beautiful, and all cigarettes unanimously called for higher prices, because credit had eased, buying interest had increased, and the removal of goods from shops was unhindered, and replenishment was plentiful. The prices of various Chinese cigarettes, which had already fallen to factory prices, have all risen by 4 to 5 yuan. Yizhong cigarettes have also risen by 10% to 20%. The general view is that cigarettes are currently in a hot selling season, and if credit continues to ease, the future should still be optimistic.</p>
<p>Daily necessities such as soap and matches have also seen a strong rise. Gu Ben rose by more than 40 yuan per box, Arrow Knife rose by 50 yuan, and Huang Xiangmao was calling for 260 yuan per box. Matches were stable, with Meili matches still calling for 2,600 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e91">Lin Chaiyong's Resignation Approved <a href="#e91" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c91" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">91</a></h3>
<p>Appointed Full-time Secretary-General of the Central Bank Rediscount Committee</p>
<p>Lin Chongyong, Secretary-General of the Central Bank Rediscount Committee, has been concurrently serving as the Director of the Shanghai Financial Administration Bureau for more than three months. Mr. Lin recently stated that the business of the Rediscount Committee is complicated, and after the four-bank joint office was ordered to close, all loan business was merged into the Rediscount Committee, which greatly increased the workload. It is difficult to take care of the concurrent position in the Financial Administration Bureau, and it has been approved. In the future, he will serve as the full-time Secretary-General of the Rediscount Committee in order to achieve sound development of the national bank's rediscount business. As for the successor to the Director of the Financial Administration Bureau, the Ministry of Finance is carefully selecting a candidate.</p>
<h3 id="e92">Credit Eases <a href="#e92" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c92" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">92</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday was the middle of November, and the amount of cash in the market was extremely scarce. Banks were exhausted to fulfill obligations, and strictly limited cash withdrawals for customers. Therefore, the street discount rate was as high as 150 yuan per 1,000 yuan. As for the trend of credit, it gradually eased, with secret interest rates between 9 jiao and 1.2 yuan, and turnover was quite cheap.</p>
<h3 id="e93">Legal Tender and Northeast Circulation Vouchers to Be Exchanged Completely Before the 20th <a href="#e93" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c93" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">93</a></h3>
<p>The municipal government received a telegram from the Ministry of Finance, the general idea being that legal tender and Northeast circulation vouchers should be completely redeemed before the 20th of this month, and a public announcement should be made to urge holders to exchange them at the Central Bank and its designated agent banks before the deadline to avoid losses. After receiving the telegram, the municipal government, in addition to making a public announcement, also ordered all subordinates to take note.</p>
<h3 id="e94">Government Decides to Allocate a Large Amount of Silver Dollars for the Purchase of Grain <a href="#e94" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c94" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">94</a></h3>
<p>In order to solve the grain panic, the authorities have decided to allocate a large amount of silver dollars for the purchase of grain. As the autumn harvest begins, farmers have grain to sell, and silver dollars are trusted by them. The National Bank has completed preparations for the silver dollars that have been exchanged, and is waiting for the government's order to release them. It is said that the highest number of silver dollars for grain purchases is as high as 20 million.</p>
<h3 id="e95">Banks Increase Capital in Cash and Open Special Accounts for Storage <a href="#e95" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c95" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">95</a></h3>

<p>After the promulgation of the Gold Yuan Coupon Issuance Regulations, the foreign exchange rate for US dollars has increased to 20 Gold Yuan Coupons per dollar, which is a five-fold difference from the original exchange rate.

According to news from the Export Committee, this work is expected to begin before the end of this month.</p>
<h3 id="e99">Yarn and Cloth Rebound Yesterday; Coarse Yarn Trend Is Sharper <a href="#e99" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c99" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">99</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the yarn market showed signs of easing credit, with various gangs actively expressing intent to buy, and the removal of goods was especially healthy for 20-count coarse yarns. The market supply was not smooth, and the price quotes were even sharper. The rise in fine yarn prices was moderate due to weak buying interest in the weaving industry.</p>
<p>42-count Blue Phoenix initially called for 10,023 yuan, but there were sales along the way, and the price once retreated to 9,300 yuan. However, as it approached the noon close, various parties stepped in to buy, and the price quotes gradually rose, advancing from 9,350 yuan to 11,200 yuan. Finally, due to profit-taking, the price retreated to 10,200 to 10,300 yuan.</p>
<p>40-count Jincheng was 9,300 yuan, 32-count Yinyue was 8,600 yuan, and 21-count Shuangma yarn once rose to 8,200 yuan, but finally closed at 7,800 yuan. Overall, the price quotes for coarse and fine yarns rose by about 10% compared to the weekend.</p>
<p>Cotton Cloth Strengthens</p>
<p>Yesterday, the cotton cloth market still had good external trends. Both local and foreign gangs were buying, and those with goods were unwilling to sell, so price quotes rose steadily. 12-pound Longtou fine cloth initially called for 290 yuan, but rose to a high of 365 yuan as cloth merchants and retailers rushed to buy, up 50 yuan from the weekend.</p>
<p>Sijunzi Yuan Bi Ji rose from 300 yuan to 335 yuan, where someone bought in, and then rose to 375 yuan, also up 50 yuan. 190 Shilin cloth called for more than 600 yuan. Other poplins, coarse cloth, bleached cloth, and colored cloth were also strong.</p>
<p>Cotton Market Continues to Weaken</p>
<p>Brokers continued to sell off existing cotton yesterday, while factories had little buying interest. Prices fell further. Guide traded 200 bales at 1,100 yuan, Shashi traded 300 bales at 1,550 yuan, Hankou fine velvet traded 50 bales at 1,400 yuan, and Zhoupu zihua was currently trading at 260 yuan, with futures at 280 yuan.</p>
<p>Textile Construction Allocates Yarn</p>
<p>Textile Construction allocated 60 pieces of cotton yarn yesterday, totaling Gold Yuan 501,700 yuan. The allocation price was 57,000 yuan for 15-count Fengnian, 60,000 yuan for 20-count Tianguang, 85,000 yuan for 40-count Baoguang, and 92,000 yuan for 42-count Shuanggu Honglima.</p>
<p>Furthermore: Textile Construction has changed the date for allocating yarn to the weaving industry starting yesterday. The procedure is as follows: Every Monday, dyeing and weaving industries in levels A, B, C, D, E, and F will apply for purchase. On Wednesdays, the underwear manufacturing industry and the knitting industry will apply for purchase. On Fridays, the towel industry, handkerchief industry, bed sheet industry, canvas industry, wood yarn industry, hand knitting industry, and hand cotton weaving industry will apply for purchase.</p>
<h3 id="e100">Woolen Fabrics Continue to Fall <a href="#e100" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c100" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">100</a></h3>
<p>Wholesale prices for woolen fabrics have continued to fall recently. Zhanghua woolens, which sold for as high as 350 yuan, can now be purchased for 175 yuan per yard on the market. People still expect prices to weaken further, and actual transactions are not numerous. The reasons for the consecutive sharp declines are nothing more than the following points: (1) Free price quotes were inflated too high. (2) The government announced that coins would be issued soon. (3) The Xuzhou-Bengbu campaign had uncertain outcome. (4) Credit was tight, and interest rates were extremely high. (5) The rise was too sharp, and actual sales were sluggish. (7) Gangs from Nanjing and elsewhere continued to bring goods to Shanghai for sale. Few people opened up with the China Textile Corporation and China Trust Company, and prices were deliberately quoted low, and they did not care much about whether or not they were successful.</p>
<h3 id="e101">Directorate General of Supplies and the Oil Allocation Committee Announce the Total Amount of Diesel and Gasoline Imported <a href="#e101" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c101" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">101</a></h3>
<p>The Directorate General of Supplies and the Oil Allocation Committee reported: From January to September of this year, the total amount of gasoline imported within and above quota has exceeded 49 million U.S. gallons, with an average monthly import of 5.5 million U.S. gallons. The highest import was in February, exceeding 9.6 million U.S. gallons, while the lowest import was in September, with only over 1 million U.S. gallons.</p>
<p>The total amount of aviation gasoline imported from January to September of this year has also exceeded 7.8 million U.S. gallons, with an average monthly import of 850,000 U.S. gallons. The highest import was in February, reaching 2 million U.S. gallons, but there were no imports in January and July.</p>
<p>Diesel can be divided into three categories: (1) Light diesel: From January to September of this year, approximately 140,000 tons were imported, with an average of slightly more than 15,000 tons per month. More was imported in January, with over 27,000 tons, while only 2,480 tons were imported in April.</p>
<p>(2) Medium diesel: Approximately 190,000 tons were imported during this period, with an average of slightly more than 21,000 tons per month. In addition to imports within quota, the most was imported in August, with over 30,000 tons, and only 480 tons in September.</p>
<p>(3) Electric diesel: There were no additional imports in the nine months. The total amount exceeded 14,000 tons, with an average of nearly 1,560 tons per month. Nearly 4,000 tons were imported in July, while there were no imports in February, June, and September.</p>

<h3 id="e102">Silk Market Wavering <a href="#e102" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c102" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">102</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the silk market showed a turnaround. Credit in the market was easing, and dealers were not lacking orders, but holders quoted prices without selling. However, silk weavers were already satiated and had little interest in buying. Local merchants only purchased in small quantities, making it difficult for the market to rise, and the closing was quite stable. On the No. 120 overpass, the morning opening was shouted at 10,500 yuan, but retail investors sold continuously, and prices softened again, reflecting a value of 10,000 yuan. Afterwards, the market hovered around 9,000 yuan, with a slightly bullish closing, showing little difference from last Saturday.</p>
<p>The raw silk market entered a consolidation phase. Credit within the industry had eased, and the market atmosphere was relaxed. Sales were not robust, and local demand was also weak, limiting price fluctuations.</p>
<p>Due to the consolidation of raw materials, silk and satin dealers were unable to raise prices. Credit in the market was very loose, but actual sales were sluggish. Customer demand was dismal, and local sales were stagnant. Bedding and other goods were ignored, and crepe and broadcloth were also not selling well. Confidence was weak. The opening showed some positive signs, but there were still many declines, and the closing was unremarkable.</p>
<h3 id="e103">Agricultural Bank Purchases Wheat Seeds, Already Over Ten Thousand Dan <a href="#e103" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c103" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">103</a></h3>
<p>The China Agricultural Bank, in order to meet the actual needs of wheat seed loans for the coming spring, entrusted the China Agricultural Supply and Marketing Company to carry out purchases. The wheat seed purchases were difficult to initiate due to price controls. Currently, the purchase work can proceed as usual. It is reported that the company has now purchased over two thousand city dan of wheat seeds, but some of this is being purchased on behalf of the Jiangsu Agricultural Improvement Institute.</p>
<h3 id="e104">Pakistani Raw Cotton Still Has Room for Negotiation <a href="#e104" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c104" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">104</a></h3>
<p>The yarn and cloth market can also be greatly expanded</p>
<p>Regarding this year's Pakistani cotton quota for our country, since the country's Deputy Minister of Commerce Hasni expressed the hope that our country would send a trade delegation to negotiate, the textile industry and cotton merchants have paid close attention to this.</p>
<p>It is generally believed that it is naive and ridiculous for Pakistan to use this as a weapon to improve relations between China and Pakistan, but at a time when our country's raw cotton problem urgently needs to be resolved, it is also necessary for our government to take this opportunity to actively strive for it.</p>
<p>To understand the export situation of Pakistani cotton this year, and the possible increase in our country's quota, the reporter visited Mr. Zhao Feijun, a cotton magnate from Shanghai who recently returned from Pakistan, yesterday morning. According to Mr. Zhao, the total amount of raw cotton available for export from Pakistan this year is about 1.3 million bales. Although the current allocations have been largely determined, if our government can seize the opportunity, it is very possible to add another 50,000 bales on top of the existing quota of 15,000 bales. Moreover, of the 650,000 bales supplied by Pakistan to the Indian government, it is stipulated that India must purchase a certain percentage before the end of January next year. If India cannot purchase half of it within this period, Pakistan is free to dispose of the remaining raw cotton. Therefore, if our country strives for it properly, exceeding 50,000 bales is not absolutely impossible.</p>
<p>Mr. Zhao also pointed out that the importance of this issue lies not in the increase in this year's quota, but in the future supply of raw cotton and the competition for the Pakistani yarn and cloth market. He said that Pakistan, with a population of 100 million, has only 50,000 spindles, so the import of yarn and cloth accounts for the largest share of the country's imports every year. This great market is now being eyed by the Japanese textile industry. How our country's government and people can seize the opportunity is a question worth studying.</p>
<h3 id="e105">New Loan Policy of Banks and Bureaus Has Been Decided in Principle <a href="#e105" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c105" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">105</a></h3>
<p>The new loan policy of national banks and bureaus was discussed in Beijing in mid-last month by the Ministry of Finance, which invited responsible personnel from the Central Bank and decided on the principles. The proposal was submitted to the Executive Yuan for review and is now in the final stages of implementation. According to Mr. Lin Chongyong, Chief Secretary of the Rediscount Committee of the Central Bank in this city, the Ministry of Finance is currently conducting further research on this matter. The new policy has been decided in principle, aiming to minimize applications for re-pledging and rediscounting with the Central Bank, in order to achieve the goal of completing the new loan policy without increasing the issuance of currency.</p>

<p>[Question from Mr. Li Jinxian] I married in 1938. My parents passed away successively ten years ago (without a will). My four younger brothers are not engaged in proper occupations and have sold all the farmland. Now they plan to sell the only remaining residence. I would like to ask: (1) Can I request a share of the property? (2) If I can request a share, and they refuse, what should I do?</p>
<p>[Answer from Lawyer Chuan Kuang] (1) I am also an heir under Article 1138, Paragraph 1 of the Civil Code and may request the division of the inheritance at any time.

<p>(Answer to Mr. Li Jiahai's question): (1) Printed matter sent to Guangzhou is temporarily suspended due to transportation difficulties. Small book packages sent to Guangzhou can now be mailed. (2) Book post takes longer than letters. The arrival time depends on whether there is surplus tonnage on trains and ships. (3) The postage for sending newspapers and magazines by airmail is calculated as follows: (A) The initial weight of printed matter is 10,000 yuan for the first 150 grams, and 5,000 yuan for each additional 150 grams, up to a maximum of 2 kilograms. (B) An additional 95,000 yuan is charged for every 20 grams of airmail. Currently, airmail of printed matter to any part of the country is temporarily suspended due to lack of tonnage on aircraft.</p>

<p>The National Construction Savings Bonds were issued for savings based on specific wartime regulations and are currently calculated based on the face value of the legal tender.  The interest rate is then converted to gold yuan for redemption. The government has not issued additional redemption methods. When savings bonds are due, they should be redeemed at the original issuing branch, but any postal remittance bureau may be entrusted to redeem them from the original issuing branch.</p>

<h3 id="e111">A Profile of General Huang Baitao <a href="#e111" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c111" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">111</a></h3>
<p>— Song Renying</p>
<p>His achievements were the greatest during the Central Plains Campaign, and he has achieved brilliant results in the current Xuzhou Campaign.</p>
<p>General Huang Baitao, courtesy name Huanran, is from Hebei Province. He is a man of few words, humble and gentle, with the demeanor of a cautious general. He is a model soldier of our time and is worthy of the title. During the Central Plains Campaign in the summer, he made the greatest contribution. President Chiang Kai-shek awarded him the highest honor, the Order of Blue Sky and White Sun, and personally pinned it on his chest. In the current Xuzhou Campaign, Huang is serving as the commander-in-chief of the eastern wing, and after six days and nights of bloody battles, he has annihilated more than 46,000 enemy troops. It is expected that a great victory will be achieved in the near future.</p>
<p>General Huang had great ambitions since he was a child. When he was studying in elementary school, he often ordered children to practice military exercises, saying, "If we practice well today, we can defeat the foreigners who invade us in the future." When he commanded the children, he was very organized in tactics such as advance, retreat, attack, and defense. His teachers and others were amazed by his actions, praised him unanimously, and gave him the title of Little Huang Zhong.</p>
<p>Although General Huang is strict in governing the army, he treats his soldiers extremely well. When training soldiers, he often personally tests various combat techniques and never lets anyone be perfunctory or get by with mediocrity. Soldiers' food, clothing, housing, and transportation are also equal, without distinction between high and low. Those who have contributed to the corps or those who are selfless are especially respected, valued, encouraged, and rewarded. Wherever his army goes, it does not commit the slightest offense, and even chickens and dogs are not disturbed. The local people all carry pots of pulp to welcome the kingly army. He marches quickly, and his combat effectiveness is also very strong. During the last Central Plains Campaign, when Luoyang and other places were in great danger, his troops were still stationed in northern Jiangsu. After receiving the order from his superiors to provide rescue, he immediately set up camp that day and ordered his subordinates to arrive at a certain place by daytime. At that time, the enemy was very proud of the war. Unexpectedly, Huang's army suddenly attacked in the middle of the night and was beaten to pieces and fled in panic. Seeing that the war had been won, Huang was slightly relieved, but seeing the tragic situation on the battlefield with corpses lying everywhere and blood flowing like a river, he could not help but burst into tears. Huang often hopes that the Communists will lay down their butcher knives, save the country, and save the people, and even hopes that the Communists will sacrifice the small self, take care of the big self, and unite with all parties to jointly revitalize China.</p>
<p>Huang's family has none of the extravagance of today's dignitaries and can be compared to Zeng Wenzheng's family's advocacy of frugality and simplicity. The author went to Huang's residence the other day for something and saw Mrs. Huang wearing old clothes and managing miscellaneous affairs at home. Mrs. Huang is known for her virtue and wisdom and teaches her children well. Her eldest son, Xiaoxian, studied with me in the first half of the year and is now studying at the Naval Academy. He is excellent in character and academics and is expected to have a great future.</p>
<h3 id="e112">All Aspects of Longdong <a href="#e112" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c112" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">112</a></h3>
<p>— Our Reporter Song Lin</p>
<p>[Our newspaper Xifeng Town dispatch on the 10th] Someone once said that due to the coincidence of history, geography, and culture, Longdong's position in Gansu is like that of the Nine Eastern Provinces in China, and Xifeng Town, the command center of Longdong, should naturally be considered the Shenyang of Gansu.</p>
<p>In terms of military and political facilities, Xifeng Town commands the center of the nine counties of Longdong and serves as half the barrier of the Northwest. The result of the bandits' coveting over the years has led to the Longdong Annihilation War in the spring of this year, occupying a glorious page in the history of bandit suppression. The traces of the battle left after the battle can still be vaguely recognized today, but many of the evil seeds sown by the bandits—bandits and lurking sporadic forces—have not yet been completely eliminated.</p>
<p>Under the principle of "seeking stability in destruction and seeking construction in stability," the local government has launched urgent clean-up and soothing work. The implementation of policies such as baojia and disaster relief is progressing day by day and fermenting in every corner of the counties. The people and the government have a common desire: stability and construction. Xifeng Town, located in the mountains, cannot escape the impact of the Gold Yuan currency wave. Although it suffered a lot of panic during the Longdong battle, it immediately returned to the status of a financial and economic center after the battle. After the "August 19" new economic reform, the management agencies have been slow to establish themselves. Merchants and people initially took a wait-and-see attitude, and later began to speculate. For two months, prices have been rising every day. Although there are no measures such as "price limits," it is the same as "having a market but no sales." Hard currency still has an extremely strong lineup in Longdong, causing trouble at any time, causing each dou of wheat to increase from more than 3 million legal tender to two or three times. Other goods naturally also rose. The daily necessities close to the bandit area are being searched for by the bandits at a higher price, and many ignorant people have been hooked by the temptation of profit.</p>
<p>Longdong's appearance is simple, frugal, and industrious. Under the warm autumn sun, the crops in the countryside have been harvested, and the ochre soil has also been cultivated, spreading the fragrance of the earth. Ox carts drag golden wheat stalks and slowly transport them to the threshing ground. The farmers on the threshing ground are even more busy threshing the wheat. Only the ragged old farmers, with旱烟嘴made of cattle bones, are sunbathing in front of the desolate village.</p>
<p>But Longdong is still shackled by the shackles of decay and decline. The people here suffer from a cultural anemia. Newspapers have become a luxury enjoyment here, and only a very small number of people can access them. The general public is abnormally ignorant of current affairs. The "New Long News" comes out every other day, with a small page size, blurred printing, and poor and rigid content and layout. Only the local garrison listens to the radio every day and posts a few brief messages. What can these dozens of words tell people? "Oh, it turns out there is such a 'big thing'!" This is what I heard.</p>
<p>Under the call of the provincial government's economic, cultural, health, and self-defense construction, the counties of Longdong have been concentrating most of their energy on self-defense construction, which is naturally due to the urgent requirements in reality. The local self-defense forces in the counties of Longdong have been established little by little through a long period of actual combat experience. They have made indelible contributions during the Longdong battle, but in that battle, they also exposed the weakness of mutual disharmony and fighting on their own. The government, in order to cherish this force that has fought the Communists for two years, has also retrained self-defense cadres, focusing on the inspiration of combat techniques. A month ago, it was ordered to reorganize the Security First, Third Regiments, and Cavalry First, Second, Third Companies into the new 29th Brigade, with Chen Zhuo, Deputy Commander of the Provincial Security, transferred to serve as the brigade commander. At present, the brigade's establishment, weapons, equipment, and treatment have all been raised to the level of the National Army's reorganized units. With the abundant fighting spirit of each team and the glorious past achievements, it is expected that it will form a strong force to protect the Northwest in the future.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper Liu'an, 10th dispatch] The lead protagonist of the widely spread embezzlement case of the grain official is Wang Jishan, the former Section Chief of the First Section of the Field Grain Administration. Ever since the county government placed Wang under custody, it has been investigating this case from many angles and collecting evidence. Now, it is learned that the county government has reported the Wang case to the provincial government for instructions on handling. The provincial government has approved them separately. For the part of Wang's grain borrowing, the county government will handle it with administrative penalties. As for the part of falsely reporting grain losses in the warehouse, it should be transferred to the court for trial. After receiving the order from the county government, the entire case has been transferred to the local court. Chief Prosecutor Huang Renxu of that court concluded the investigation and filed a public prosecution.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper Zhenjiang, 15th dispatch] In order to stabilize local security and cooperate with the suppression, the Jiangsu Provincial Security Headquarters will promote the police-encouragement zone system in the counties of Jiangnan. The Jiangsu Provincial Police School is currently planning to transfer and train police officers from various counties in Jiangnan, teaching them various subjects of the police-encouragement zone system, in order to serve as the foundation cadres for the implementation of the police-encouragement zone system.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper Ningbo, 15th dispatch] The Old City God Temple in this port was repaired after Mr. Jin Tingsun and other local gentry raised funds. It took half a year and cost a great deal of money. The entire project has been largely completed, with painted rafters and carved beams, and a golden and brilliant appearance. The temple has been completely renovated. The opening ceremony is scheduled for the 20th of this month, and it is the only major event in the midst of the port's general decline.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper Report] It is reported that the Danyang Branch of the Central Cooperative Bank purchased more than 10,000 stones of rice at high prices in Changzhou during the "August 19" price-restricted period, falsely claiming that it was purchased from other ports and processed in Changzhou. Recently, the county government, fearing a panic in the county's rice supply due to shallow reserves and blocked grain sources, launched an inspection of various factories and shops and learned that the materials were suspicious. On the 11th, it specially dispatched the Social Affairs Section Chief to conduct a strict investigation with the Field Grain Administration before the truth was revealed. The processing of this rice is planned to be carried out by the Field Grain Administration at the "August 19" price limit, and the rice will be allocated for the fair-priced sale of rice in Changzhou. Moreover, it is widely rumored in the city that this rice was colluded by a small number of senior officials of the Central Cooperative Bank with local gentry, who used the name of the Central Cooperative Bank to hoard and purchase rice, intending to make huge profits.</p>

<p>Hangzhou</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Report] The Zhejiang Provincial Government, in order to secure the suppression of bandits in southern Zhejiang, has stationed Deputy Commander Wang Yunpei in Wenzhou, and will establish the Southern Zhejiang Command Headquarters there. The primary task is to eliminate the bandits in the rich agricultural areas to ensure sufficient food supplies and appease the people of southern Zhejiang.</p>
<p>Zhenjiang</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Report] The market here has gradually returned to normal, but because the prices of various goods have risen to several times to more than ten times their original prices, the purchasing power of the people has declined. Although prices have fallen in the past three days, rice still stands within the 500 mark. On the 14th, mountain firewood fell from 40 yuan to 20 yuan, pork fell from 18 yuan to 12 yuan, and foreign currency also fell by 50%. After the stores resumed business, the "competitive sales" were very intense, but there were few customers, which was the exact opposite of the previous "panic buying" period.</p>
