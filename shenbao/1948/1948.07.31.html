<h3>總統夫婦飛蒞滬濱　在杭曾召空校官生訓話　朂勉負起重任完成革命</h3>
<p>〔本報莫干山卅日電〕總統今晨延見翁院長等，商談並指示財政金融諸問題後，午睡至四時許，五時許與夫人略進晚餐，八時，總統衣草黃色軍便服，夫人衣白花長旗抱，偕同杭市長周象賢，浙保安副司令王雲沛下山赴杭。</p>
<p>又，總統左右，速日在山調查物價。</p>
<p>〔本報杭州卅日電〕總統夫婦亽今日下午六時，自莫干山抵杭，中途在劎池略市休息，並觀飛瀑，旋即下山，至庚村乘汽車於八時十分抵算橋機塲，即召集空校全體官生訓話，大意略謂：「空軍是海陸空軍的主幹，在此戡亂時期，負有車大責任；中國空軍的任務是建國·建軍，希望空校學生潔身自愛，完成此革命重任」。歴時廿分鐘，旋與胡校畏停克，陳主席儀，湯恩伯·王雲沛等開談，至九時掿機飛滬，侍從人員隨行，蔣經國夫婦會珒機塲送行。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕總統偕夫人已於昨晚九時四十分蒞滬，隨行者有軍務局長俞濟時及秘會曹聖芬等數人，央行總裁俞鴻鈞亦同機返滬。總統此次來滬，全爲轉到性質，定日內即返京。本市首長昨晚前往龍華機塲恭迎者，有吳市長·潘議長·宣司令·方主委·俞局長等。總統昨穿草黃色軍便服，神采煥發，下專機後，即驩車赴東平路官邸休息。吳市長·宣司令等隨往作十分鐘之請示後，即匆辭出。今日總統之專機，係由衣復恩大隊長駕駛。</p>
<p>總統昨晚由杭抵滬下機時留影（本報攝）</p>
<h3>莫干山上商討決定財政金融新措施　翁院長王財長等返抵京</h3>
<p>〔本報南京卅日電〕翁院長文　，王外長世杰，王財長雲五，徐財次柏園，美援運用委員嚴家淦等一行，廿九日應總統召飛杭登莫干山晋謁總統，已於卅日下午七時正乘自强號專機飛返京。翁等卅日離莫干干山時，曾於上午十時再度晋謁總統談話，約兩小吋，就某項經濟金融措施，作詳盡報吿與請示。中午在莫干山飯店進餐後，於下午一時半下山，四時許在西湖小游，並遊靈隱寺，旋於六時自算橋機塲起飛返京。翁院長等在山晋謁總統，所報吿與請示者，爲國家總預算之執行問題，尤其着重者爲立院審議總頸算完成後，根據目前國家財政收支實况，如何與立院通過之總預算配合問題。此外，對於美援之運用，亦曾由嚴家淦提出報吿，並商討如何妥爲運用，以大量吸收法幣回籠，均已有具體之決定。至於金融之管制，原則上亦決定，縱續加強執行，俾收平衡收支，穩定經濟之效果。</p>
<p>〔本報南京卅日電〕政府爲平衡收支，穩定通貨，俾有效執行國家總預算起見，已決定於短期內採取財政金融緊急措施。此項措施，翁院長等登山晋謁總統後，已臻具體及成熟。翁氏等下山返京時，各要員雖均對在山上所決定者爲何事嚴守秘密，但記者在機塲中反覆向翁院長探問，翁氏亦承認「短期內會有消息」。據自權咸方面獲悉：在目前客觀情形之下，財政金融必須有一措施，現預算收支不能平衡，生活指數逐月增高，數字甚巨，而立院所通過之總預算，事實上恐不足以維持過久，必須有新的措施，始足以應付需要，此項揹施聞大體上仍從金融政策上着手，對游資作祟，將有適當之處直。至關於幣制之改革，目前又甚囂　上，但必須有一準備階段，政府有充分力量控制時，始可着手，如初步準備工作已有把握，當可進行幣制之改革。</p>
<p>又，記者在機塲曾向王財長請詢：外傳莫干山會議已決定改革幣制，並即將開始實施，是否屬實？王氏連稱「不確！不確」！</p>
<h3>調查七五事件　翁院長特派　秦德純赴平</h3>
<p>〔中央社南京卅日電〕自七五事件發生後，政府深爲關切，前日政院頒發文電，令有關機關妥謀善後，並同意平市各方所組織之調查委員會，對當時肇事眞相進行調查，以爲行政司法當局處理之參考。茲悉翁院長此次赴莫干山晋謁總統，報告行政處理此事之三項辦法，總統備極關注，翁院長頃已回京，下機後即指派國防部秦次長德純迅往北平，會同調查。秦次長於抗戰以前曾任北平市長與故都人士，多屬知交，此次彼以其公正誠摯之精神受命前往，首都人士皆信其有助於事件之結束。</p>
<h3>監院宣告暫休會　于院長勉盡量鏟除貪污　各行署監委即分別出發</h3>
<p>〔本報南京三十日電〕行憲監察院集會以來，已歷五十餘日，舉行會議凡廿八次，任務圓滿達成，自三十一日始休會。各監委分別就道首途，至各行署所在區籌組行署，展開工作，同時，留京委員亦將即日進行各委員會之組織，監院工作自三十一日始進入正規工作之階段。監院于院長於三十日午後末次會中曾致簡短之詞，大略如次：我們行憲第一屆監院集會將屆兩個月，這兩個月的工作，都是本院最主要準備工作，也可說是監察制度的改造工作，現在集會已吿一段落，大會雖說暫時可以休會了，但是我們的休會不是停止工作，而正是監察工作的開始。行署委員已經選定，各委員會也已組成，希望大家本着過去兩個月的精神，共同努力，把危害國家民族的貪汚份子，盡量鏟除，樹立憲政良好的基礎，這是大家應有的責任。</p>
<h3>辭讓行署委員　遞補人選通過</h3>
<p>〔本報南京卅日電〕監察院卅日晨舉行第廿八次會議，于院長主席，討論並修正通過以次兩案：（一）監察委員行署委員會議規則，（二）監委行署辦事細則，以上兩項法規均係今後行署工作之依據，今日得以完成，此後行署之工作俟各監委遄赴各行署所在地區後，即可展開。下午三時半續舉行第廿八次會，副院長劉哲公畢返京，亦出席會議。主席于院長宣布開會後，旋即報告上午各監察區行署委員有數人辭讓，業由各該區察委員自行商定，另推候選人，計豫魯區祁大鵬辭讓，由曹承德祖任，兩廣區賀有年辭讓，由金越先祖任，晋陝綏虈谷鳳翔辭讓，由李紀才祖任，豫魯郭仲隗辭讓，由得票次多數之朱乃洪遞補，至朱任社會衛生委會召築人一職，則由侯天民遞補，全塲委員均無異議通過。</p>
<h3>對藏商務代表糾正案付審查</h3>
<p>又馮雲仙等十五人提出臨時動議，以西藏商務代表因未經政府許可發給護照，竟自赴美活動，而政院對上述有損國權之事，夫聞如何處置，應予糾正，當經大會決議，交外交僑教委員及蒙藏委員會審查。最後主席以依照第邪惡六次會議決議，行署及巡察團同時成立，現行署委員已全部選出，但關於巡察團之組織，因編列預算及工作計劃等問題尙待解決，可否提交八月份會議討論，經在堪委員一致無異議通過，至此，歷經五十六天之會議，吿一段落。</p>
<h3>按照議則規定八月起開月會</h3>
<p>于院長在徵得大會同意後，宣吿暫時休會。自八月份起，按照會議規則之規定，每月開會一次，幷對各委員兩月來之辛勞表示慰勉。李煦寰·倪弼·李夢彪亦先後起立致詞，大意謂：兩個月來監院集會爲「坐而言」，今後則爲「起而行」，行署及本院應保持密切連絡，同心協力，發揮監察之力量，會議乃在融洽空氣中圓滿休會。又于院長於下午一時曾假勵志社禮堂設宴，招待全體委員，藉誌慰勉及餞別之意。</p>

<h3>王雲五在山談話　晋謁總統報告總預算　美援欵項已開始動用</h3>
<p>〔本報莫干山卅日電〕翁院長等今晨在莫干山飯店進早點，王世杰則偕公子遊山，於七時許返旅邸，共進早點。翁等小作會談後，推王雲五接見記者稱：此來爲立院通過之總頸算內中不無有調整或裁减機構，或對某一機構合减經費之處，並對今後總預算之執行技術問題，須向總統報吿請示，故特來此。至美援運用，則已在中美雙邊協定中明白規定，其中有我國可自由運用用之部門，目前已有一億二千五百萬美元，正式開始動用。近來國內物價，已見穩定。記者旋詢以法幣是否將以關金代替？據吿：關金與法幣已屬一體，政府無意代替。又詢：關金券數値較法幣加大，將來是否以他種幣制代之？王答：此當視事實與需要而定，惟目前尙未談到。記者復詢：滬投機商人是否嚴辦？答：依法當然嚴辦。記者問：此次來山，是否將對金融財政有一新的方案產生？王氏笑曰：不知時已八時，翁等即去總統宮邸，舉行商談，並聆取指示。</p>

<h3>粉碎對中共的幻覺</h3>
<p>自中共發表「同意共產國際情報局批評南共的決議」之後，中共究竟有沒有國家觀念，中共究竟有沒有民族意織，早就大白於天下了。但是在北平香港的所謂「第三方面」，仍在那裏散佈恢復和談和所謂「新政協」的謠言，友邦人士對於中共自華北的秘密電臺發出救濟黃災的呼籲，也是議論紛紛，不是說中共亦將步南共狄托元帥的後塵，就是說中共內部行將分裂。這似乎中外人士對於中共的眞面目，還沒有認識淸楚。翁院長爲澄淸中外的觀聽起見，乃於廿八日向全國人民發表「明辨是非共赴國難」的文吿，除了暴露中共背叛國家的猙獰面目而外，並以「到了此種存亡主奴的關頭，決沒有模棱兩可，瞻顧徘徊的餘地」，勉勵全國人民，共赴國難。全文雖有萬言之長，但簡單明暸，詞嚴義正，確是翁院長就聯以來最重要的文告。此不但爲國際所重視，尤爲全國朝野所一致擁護。</p>
<p>若干人評論國事，總以萬方多難，罪在政府，好像目前的社會不安，民生凋敝，都是起因於戡亂，而此種戡亂的戰事政府何以不能避免，反置中共的破壞騷擾於不論不議之列。殊不知目前中國的大病在於「是非不明，黑白不分」。姑以中共的本質而論，大家都知范共產黨的特性，並不在於它有一個共產主義，而在於它的階段鬥爭，受命於共產國際的指揮。在過去，偏偏有一部分人士，尤其若干友邦人士，對於中國共產黨的本質，抱着幻想，誤認爲中共也有國家觀念，也有民族意識，不過主張土地改革而巳。因爲有這種幻想的存在，故把中共視爲普通政黨，我國政府雖明知此種看法的謬誤，但也存着與人爲善的心理，願和他們協商，試求組織所謂「聯合政府」。這　錯覺和幻想，不僅當時影響一般人心，而且和該遷延日久，反爲中共所利用，儘量培養它的實力，儘量擴充它的地盤。後來政府雖巳覺悟，但是後悔莫及，養　貽患，鑄成大錯。凡是洞悉和談經過的人，固無不承認當時幻想的貽誤國事。就是當時堅決主張中國組織聯合政府的友邦人士，到了捷克政變發生之後，也無不恍然大悟了。</p>
<p>我們不怕有錯，但怕執迷不悟。然而若干職業政客，明知中共是共產國際的支部，絕無民族意識，絕無國家觀念，明知中共是暴力專政的政黨，絕無民主自由可言，但是他們仍在那裏歌頌「新民主主義」，偶然聽到召開「新政治協商會議」的流言，便喜形於色，爭相走吿，以爲中共將和他們組織「聯合政府」，就可以分得一官半職，又聽到中共電台廣播「民族資本」的誑言，便替中共向工商界大肆活動，暗送秋波，以爲中共痲取政權之後，工商界照樣也可以經商生產。這些百欺欺人之言，雖然荒唐無稽得非常可笑，但因爲社會上是非不明，黑白不分，以政誤信受騙的，居然也不乏其人。而今翁院長的文吿，率直指出：「中共旣同意共產國際譴責南共發揚民族主義，其本身自然根本否定了民族主義，中共旣贊同共產國際反對南共允許小資產階級及農工人等代表全國以代替共黨的一黨專政其所號召的「民主聯合政府」，根本就是其政治陰謀的烟幕；中共旣同意共產國際攻擊南共遠背馬列主義，允許土地私有，人民可以自由賣買土地，中共的宣傳招撫富農，穩定中農，自然也是個空洞的口號；又中共旣也贊同共產國際譴責南共使個人經濟遍及全國，則中共揚言保護城市工商業，更是一個無恥的騙術。」中共的眞面目，在翁院長的筆下，寶巳暴露無遺。今日中共勢力的擴大，其基礎完全建立在它的騙術上。但變戲法的騙術，究竟只能開開玩笑，不能認以爲眞的，「一手掩盡天下耳目」的勾當，遲早終要揭破，而這次揭破中共的假面具的，實在不是翁院長，乃正是中共自己的領導人物！不但以往對於中共存着幻覺的人今已知其爲泡影，就是盲從的中共份子，尤其是靑年份子稍具有民族意識和國家觀念的，也必定能翻然覺悟，迷途知返。他們如果毅然自新，政府當能特別寬恕，許其復歸祖國的懷抱，在行憲政府之下，重做民主自由的國民。</p>

<p>青島失事民航隊機原因或係油缸爆炸</p>
<h3>機航主任自青調查返滬</h3>
<p>〔本報青島卅日電〕廿九日下午五時在滄口機塲失事焚戰之民用航空隊C46型運輸機，原因尙未查明，據測或係油缸爆炸失火，而其中所　全係軍火，故立即焚毀，無從施救。該機乘有五七旅官兵十六人，載重四六一四〇磅，油箱有油七百加侖。據曾駕該機之格林正駕駛員稱：此機飛濟已三次，從未發現障碍，除　缸爆炸外，別無理由可致失事。</p>

<h3>陳立夫在美兩訪馬歇爾　商軍事援華步驟　並曾晋風杜魯門暢談中國問題</h3>
<p>〔本報特派員二十一日華盛頓航訊〕立法院副院長陳立夫氏來美後，先後與馬歇爾將軍晤談兩次，並與國務院方面若干主要負責人士接觸。美國外交圈中人物對陳氏之訪美咸具有新鮮印象，認陳氏有愛國之眞誠以及坦白之胸懷。陳氏昨於離美赴英之前一日，晋見社魯門總統於白宮，暢談中國問題。陳氏於辭出從接見記者稱：渠曾吿總統中國局勢相當嚴重。共黨自東北獲得源源供應，日本遺留於瀋陽之大規模兵工廠及優良軍火，已爲共黨所破壞與攫取，其叛亂乃日益擴大。故中國目前所需要者爲迅速之軍事援助。杜魯門總統對於中國問題極爲瞭解同情，關於中國需要迅速軍事援助一點，亦表示同意。</p>
<p>陳氏與馬歇爾國務卿之兩度會談，其內容　秘而不宣，但記者在華府美國人士方面探悉，陳氏曾向馬卿提出中國問題較之柏林情形尤爲嚴重之意見。渠稱中國現有一百萬以上之武裝共黨，如中國赤化，印度，緬甸，越南，馬來亞等亦必將不免。陳氏復指出共產主義之威脅係一世界性問題，局部應付僅能使另一部份壓力更重而已。</p>
<p>馬歇爾與陳氏之第二次會談長達七十五分鐘，馬卿詳細剖析美國援華進行滯緩之原因，主要在於美國之繁複立法程序，無法通融。據華府有關方面傅說，馬陳第二次會談中曾涉及美國軍事援華之具體步驟，席間顧維鈞大使亦在座，顧大使且一再强調「軍事援華，貴乎迅速。」至關於財政援華及幣制改革，相信馬陳會談中並無提及，因目前貝祖詒領導之財政援華技術團仿有一部份人留駐此間也。美國外交有關人士亦稱：陳立夫並未與馬歇爾商談任何財政援華事項。</p>
<p>陳氏定於今日離美赴英，在美期間曾訪問洛杉磯市參議會，華盛頓參衆兩院，並參觀費城民主共和兩黨大會，對美國現行之民主制度，深感興趣云。</p>
<p>貝文熱烈接待陳氏</p>
<p>〔中央社倫敦卅日電〕陳立夫昨在英外務部備受貝文之熱烈接待，陳氏並在昨午波特爾子爵宴會席上晤見艾德禮·艾登及其他英政府首畏多人，並定今趨訪克利浦斯夫人。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社倫敦廿九日電〕中國立法院副院長陳立夫稱中國今正與共產主義奮鬥，英國如充分明暸中國之出此，非專爲自身計，則必出而援助中國。渠信全世界將予中國以援助。中國如在此一奮鬥中失敗，則馬來亞亦將不保。中國之失敗，亦即英國之失敗。蓋亞洲如果赤化，則英國將遭遇許多危險也。</p>

<h3>莫洛托夫託詞消度假期　三特使求見被擋駕　有向史達林直接交涉可能　具文外相在下院聲明不旁對蘇警告</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕紐約三十日廣播：據華盛頓訊，國務院頃接美國駐蘇大使館報吿謂，正當英美法三國駐蘇大使擬親向莫洛托夫提出商討柏林問題之照會之際，莫氏突宣佈渠正在消渡假期，拒不接見。此間外交界方面揣測，三强政府或將因此而直接向史達林交涉矣。但國務院對此拒絕未加評論，幷謂尙未正式接獲是項消息之報吿。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕倫教三十日廣播：美，英，法三國使節今向蘇外部要求與莫洛托夫會晤，以便將西方國家對於柏林問題之決議向蘇方提出。羅柏茲及法大使夏臺諾昨晚曾與史密斯共餐，作半小時之私人會談。羅氏與史氏親自以有關倫敦會議之情報吿知夏合諾。</p>

<p>〔合衆社華盛頓廿九日電〕英美法三國以最新策略與蘇聯交涉，岡打破柏林之封鎖後，國務院廿九日靜待莫斯科之反響。按西方決定此一策略，可測知蘇聯解除封鎖之代價及能否依此談判。權威人士同時宣稱，「西方國家之基本政策無甚變更，吾人政策之目的仍爲解除柏林之封鎖」。</p>
<p>〔合衆社倫敦三十日電〕英外相貝文將冷戰主動權，自其他西方國家手中奪取，並將和戰之抉擇置於史達林之前。貝文廿九日以戰後最强硬直率之官方文告警吿史達林稱，英國已決定在兩方面採取步驟。渠明白表示，今從之事有待史氏之選擇矣。（一）如柏林封鎖不除，局勢可能促起戰爭，無論如何英國或將停止復員計劃而重行檢討全部軍力及政策。（二）如封鎖解除，英國將參加四强談判。貝文之演說，事實上係三國使節謁莫洛托夫時代表西方所作言論之英國版預映。貝文之言，明示西方已遭遇慕尼黑以來最劣之局勢，並已決定寗戰不退却。對於此一新政策，西方官員樂觀悲觀者參半。</p>

<h3>波蘭再向美抗議反對分裂德國</h3>

<h3>九百家典當業面臨崩潰危機　質物價值躍漲市面暗息高昂　資金週轉困難遭遇嚴重打擊</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕在最近數月來之劇烈漲風中，各種正當工商業均受極大打擊，而與貧民生活息息相通之典當業，更因壓力重重，已面臨崩潰危機。繼嘉興，常熟等地大部典當歇業以後，本市九百家典當之業務目前亦陷入停頓狀態。此一具有二千餘年歷史，曾以貸款方式維繫農村社會安定之商業，現已門庭冷落，黯黑之高柜臺上，「朝奉先生」昏昏欲睡，情景慘淡異常。</p>
<p>典當業目前遭遇之最大困難，爲典當物件本身價値變異過速，及市面暗息過高。如上月初當舖收進大衣一件，照時値七八千萬元應付當費七八百萬，但當戶於本月初取贖時，大衣時値已躍至三四億，故不必贖出，「轉票」一次，當舖除將原當費及五角月息扣除外，尙須再補找當戶三千萬左右。所謂「轉票」，即當戶按照規定手續取贖，繳納原當費及月息後，再行交當，但一轉手之間，因爲當舖所拆款付出之暗息，往往較其所收入之利息爲高，故多「轉　」一次，在當舖即多遭損失一次，而加車其資金運用上之困難。</p>
<p>坐喫資金靜待破產同時因衣飾等物價格日高，散處當舖週圍專營收買當票之地攤業皮生意興隆，渠等向無力取贖之當戶購得當票，即向當鋪贖出自行轉售，故成爲當鋪資金最後挹注之「沒貨」（逾越取贖期限之當物），無形中又悉吿消失，戰前該業每月「沒貨」可佔總數三成，而目前幾等於零，此實爲各當鋪致命打擊之一。</p>
<p>在銀行業務及證券事業未發達前，數十年來，典當業始終爲大衆心目中最安全穩妥之投資地。近月市面暗息高達九角，而典當業之存利尙不及三角，於是資金均裹足不前，各當舖在精疲力竭亟需週轉之際，遭此打擊，乃益灝於危。目前各當鋪僅能向親方設法情商挪借，以應付每日不足數百萬元之零星交易，大部分則坐吃資金，靜待破產。據該業統計，戰前每家當鋪「家本」（即資金）普通均在十數萬元左右，最少亦有四萬元，和閘北當業巨魁鼎豐當鋪，戰前擁有「家本」十二萬元，約合當時黃金十二大條餘，最近兩年來連連虧蝕，一蹶不振，截至目前止，結算「家本」僅剩三億餘，折合黃金尙不足一兩。</p>
<p>國行貸款迄未實現典當業目前規定之五角月息，內包括棧租四分，手續費一角，實際利息祗有三角六分，故該業一度爲市民目爲「黑心交易」之時代早成過去。聞當局即對此三角六分之月息亦表不滿，曾令减低，俾惠貧民，並允爲救濟該業渡過難關，可由國行供給貸款，惟此事迄今尙未實現。該業公會表示在此哭笑不得之情形下，決先呈准當局，將利息照銀錢業「欠拆」比例略予提高，再隨時機動調整，俾一方面繼續勉維營業，他方面亦可稍能拉擺資金，藉使基礎不至破碎無遺。</p>
<p>勞資雙方同聲嘆苦　目前該業巳有十分之五在門首張貼「止當候贖」紅字招貼，「止當候贖」亦即關店淸理之謂，尙有十分之三實已臨關店淸理階段，但不願公開張貼吿白，據謂係爲顧全數十年老店「面子」，並恐供給資金之存戶聞訊從紛來討債所致。該業在本市原有從業員近三千人，其中職位有朝率，頭櫃，二櫃，衣包間，首飾間等十餘種之多，劃分歧密，往年均席豐履厚，傲視百業，尤以朝奉一職，在貧民眼中森嚴冷酷，權高無限，如今則因業務衰竭，裁汰並施，離職者因一生所習盡係專門技術，故轉業亦不可能。該業資方嘗感慨謂：戰前一家當鋪足抵十家烟紙店，目前十家當舖猶不及一家烟紙店之充實繁榮。該業勞方則嘆息曰：戰前我們是貧民心目中的救星，甚至「財神」，但現在月薪不滿千萬，連三輪車夫還不如！世變滄桑，令人億及民國廿三年前後典當業之豪華茂盛，實不勝今昔之感。</p>

<h3>湘濱湖洪災慘重　常德·漢壽一帶數百里杳無陸地　各災縣代表向省府請願</h3>

<h3>商人參加對日貿易　必須依照規定程序</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕商人辦理對日貿易，非經政府特准，不得有商務行爲。日本迄在盟軍管制之下，匯率未定，情形特殊，政府爲此特於去年制定「商人赴日貿易實施輔要」公佈施行，俾我國商人得在政府統籌之下，對日本進行有限度之易貨貿易。迄今商人參加者甚多，惟一般對於辦理手續，尙欠明瞭，經探詢有關主管人員，承答覆如下：</p>
<p>（甲）現金貿易：凡商人擬以國產輸售日本，除現行進出口貿易辦法附表（五）所列貨品及輸管會公吿禁止出口之貨品外，其能將出口外匯結售指定銀行者，均得按一般出口辦法，運銷日本。惟欲自日本輸華貨物，則除易貨之外，概予禁止。</p>
<p>（乙）易貨貿的：（一）凡商人欲參加對日易貨，應先向當地商會申請經商會向工商部對日貿易指導委員會推薦，由該會審查申請人合格後，再由該商就政院所核定之「一九四八年對日貿易進出口貨品範圍表」擬訂貿易計劃，呈請指導委員會核定，然後由工商部函請外交部簽發赴日護照。（二）商人與日方磋商購售合約，應送由我國駐日代表團商務專員與代表日方之機構洽訂，並應另備副本三份，送由商務專員分轉中信局工商部及輸管會。（三）商人履行購售合約時，應申請駐日代表團商務專員核發輸出入貨物證明書，商人即以正本向輸管會輸出推廣處或該會區辦事處申請核發輸出入許可證。（四）凡合格商人擬由我國輸日貨物時，應先塡具「指定銀行結購出口或轉出口外匯證明書」一式五份，連同上項商務專員所簽發之輸出貨物證明書，送請輸管會輸出推廣處或該會區辦事處核章，並加蓋對日易貨及海關驗放之戳記從，交商人報關驗放，同時商人須將左列文件，備函送請中信局作輸出貨價之登記。一，定價成交文件（列明輸日貨品之品名數量單價總價）二，報關單副本發票保險單及提貨單。（所有提貨單，應寫明中信局轉交收貨人）（五）凡合格商人擬由日本輸華貨物，或日方以貨物運交前，亦應將左列文件，備函送交駐日代表團商務專員核發輸入證明書。一，定價成交文件（列明輪華貨物之品名數量單價總價）二，中信局所出該商帳存金額之證章，或已取收該商担保之證明函件。</p>
<p>商人並應塡具「申請許可證」一式七份，連同上項商務專員所簽發之輸入證明書及有關文件，送請輸管會輸出推廣處負責人簽章或該會區辦事處核章並加蓋對日易貨戳記後，再交商人報關驗放。</p>
<h3>業外刺激加深　華股掀動買風</h3>
<p>華股昨以業外之刺激奇盛，銀根復濫得可以，買風在勉强中掀動，但業內外咸有套利，移東補西，廣幫等之買胃，僅稱穩健而已。</p>
<p>晨開時平庸，永紗以一一四〇〇元低盤登塲，三號一三五號賣到一一三八〇元，七六號二二六號等即進，升至一二二五〇元，一〇七號一四五號等脫手，退爲一二〇五〇元。此後人心尙好，無如小股及雜脾異常軟弱，形勢不定，終以紗布等又起哄動，銀根濫得無以復加，八三號一三五號等進至一二七〇〇元高價，聯地榮豐恒豐宣吿漲停，一三七號一七三號進後有出，二一六號一七二號二〇七號賣出，午收爲一二五五〇元。較前收除聯地榮豐恒豐漲停外，永紗新光梅林信和華鹽勤與新華商務統益景綸火柴中絲升半成，景福國貨美亞麗安閘北永公內衣漲一成，華新中泥平平，餘均小升。</p>
<p>後市承前市餘風，永紗上塲即逾漲限，最高加四百五，六九號一五一號等均有了結，而退入一二六〇〇元內，初傳交換差出，曾屢次漲逾限度，終以國行差進少許，業外之漲風雖盛，收市仍由二〇五號一四五號等賣到一二六〇〇元結束，美亞等漲停從，咸吿回小，聞總統有來滬說，人心頓疲也。較晨收除梅林榮豐聯地漲停，永紗美亞信和永公漲停後有回，軋過榮辱互見，恒豐跌一成，景綸小半成，華豐麗安火柴尙平，餘股升降俱微。塲外各未上市股票，以公用股及中華五洲升半成見倘，餘者平穩而已。</p>
<p>公債</p>
<p>昨成交二百餘萬，流丙晨開九二萬，自九一萬起，升至一〇三萬收市。較前收計甲乙升十萬元，丙漲十三萬元，丁升十一萬元，戊昂十二萬元。</p>
<h3>輪入許可證</h3>
<p>八月起由國行代辦簽發　並徵收千分之十手續費</p>
<p>關於輸入許可證，輸管會曾設轍入品簽證處主持其事。目前簽證處撤銷，輸管會所簽發之輸入許可證，改用主任委員名義簽章行之，另設簽證室主持其事。現簽發事項，已呈准政院委托中央銀行代辦，訂於八月一日起實行。所有輸入許可證，同日起改用簽證室主任名義簽發，並核准除特殊規定外，均應另行徵收千分之十之手續費。今後輸管會核准輸入之貨品，應向中央銀行繳納手續費，始得簽證結匯輸入。</p>
<h3>物價指數儲蓄</h3>
<p>國行與財部在商訂中</p>
<p>頃悉：政府最近爲解救當前經濟危機，正籌辦物價指數儲蓄，藉以吸收法幣回籠，保持人民之購買力。此項計劃，中央銀行正與財政部商訂中。財政部方面，認爲技術上問題太多，故此事之實現，或將延遲。物價指數儲蓄，係人民以法幣根據存入日期之物價指數計算，取用時按取用日期之物價指數計算，以免物價上漲，受幣値貶低之損失。實行之後，儲畜人將來收回儲款時，可以購買貨物之數量，乃與存入法幣時相同。因儲蓄係依據物價指數，則人人剩餘之資金，不必再如今日一般情形，囤積物資，或購買金鈔，其結果可使物價趨於穩定。在目前之情况下，此實爲唯一收縮通貨，保持購買力之辦法，巳引起各方注意，均盼早日付諸實現。</p>
<h3>公營事業匯率　一律六折計算</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕國行業務局頃通函各分行處，嗣後對國營公營事業機關匯款匯率，一律依照同業辦理，六折收費。</p>
<h3>今日到期短期庫券　償付本息辦法決定</h3>
<p>三十七年短期國庫券中國交通兩銀行　證交市塲出售者，其七月三十一日到期庫券償付本息事宜，已於昨日由中央銀行國庫局召集中國交通兩行主辦人員，會商決定。各該行本身所售出者，遇由各該行兌付。凡持券者所執蓋有中國或交通兩行硬印行戰之庫劵，應逕向各該行兌領。如無中國交通兩行蓋有硬印行戮之庫券，可持向中央銀行國庫局兌領。其在國庫局虹口收支處認購者，應仿向該處兌領云。</p>
<h3>外銷茶交易稀</h3>
<p>向以暢銷菲洲爲主之珍眉等綠茶，目前彼地雖來電垂詢，　惟出價仍頗苛刻。但此間茶商感於產價一再上揚，又以各種內銷茶，邇來本街與鄕帮實銷尙可，且買方不吝善價搜求，頻將市面激挺，故對海外來電，一時不易應付，能度遂暫取觀望。是以洋莊茶市，依然異常枯寂，形勢則靜中帶堅。</p>
<h3>銀根鬆·人心俏　棉紗布一致上升</h3>
<p>昨日棉紗市况，以銀根益形鬆弛，棉布劇升，更因自備外匯部份開放，港匯迭縮，港地紗價上揚，津粵等帮不絕搜吸，人心奇悄。</p>
<p>四十二支藍鳳細紗，初開即上竄一億，市氣以拋價提高，更形鋒銳，塲內買風强烈，雖有申新，永安廠開出，市盤依然激漲，現出疾升至廿一億六千萬結束，比上日猛漲三億一千萬元。明日出飛揚至廿二億，較上日亦再挺三億二千萬。廿一支雙馬，現出亦步秀二億七千萬，其餘各支粗細紗亦均一致跟騰一，二億左右。</p>
<p>昨日棉布市况，因原棉供應不敷，廠家仍有减工之訊，染廠以月底指數可能提增二，三成，在銀根鬆濫聲中，人心步見緊悄。十二磅龍頭細布，因紡建公司多期未開，業中需碼枯涸，各方搜吸甚股，晨開市盤即躍升四十萬元。旋以北帮及染廠等狂進，行情直綫上升至五千七百萬元收盤，較上日再度疾升三百四十萬，尙呈供不敷求之象。是以最後塲外哄至五千八九百萬，尙有納戶。其他嗶嘰粗布漂布及各檔色布士林布，一致再吿激升。</p>
<p>又訊：招商局海地輪昨晨出口，裝紗布一千五百噸運香港，三百餘運受谷，新加坡仰光什貨三百餘噸，又鮮貨一千七百件運香港。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕工商部前因日布競銷南洋，影響國產輸出甚鉅，曾電令紗管會擬具對策。茲悉該會業巳擬定，呈部核奪，擬於三十七年度內計劃購進印棉四十五萬包，美棉十五萬包，將其成品百分之二十，作爲外銷，以便抵制日貨之傾銷。並由紗管會及外銷委員會，會同國民營廠商等組南洋考察團，目的在積極推動外銷，亦係對付日本紗布傾銷對策之一種云。</p>
<h3>綢緞業成立　綢緞市塲</h3>
<p>綢緞業爲配合需要起見，昨日開始成立一綢緞市塌，從事綢緞之交易。警局爲防止不法商人乘機混雜其間，從事其他非法交易及抬價等情，巳派員監視交易。</p>
<h3>呢羢行情堅定</h3>
<p>呢羢受種種事實及環境關係，標準行情，始終成爲易高難降，祗多暫時演出大漲小回之局面而已。市貨流通，較之平價時爲缺乏。昨呢羢正式交易仿不多，行情堅昂，實銷落令。小廠家出品大廠家整理之雜牌呢羢，茶會市塲上尙有賣買，因其價較便宜，極合各地受主之胃口。</p>
<h3>行局昨轉差進</h3>
<p>昨日票據交換，四行兩局一庫合進一、一四八億元，計國行出六·五四六億元，中國進六·一七一億元，交通進一一·五七九億元，農民進六·三二三億元，中信進五·八四七億元，郵匯進一·三八四億元，中合出一·六一〇億元。洋商銀行進四·六八五億元，省市銀行曁商業行莊合出五·八三三億元。</p>
<h3>各地商情</h3>
<p>無錫　〔本報無錫卅日電〕今日物價先疲後堅，重演月底漲風。白粳三四九四萬元，白元三四三四萬元，羊秈三四七四萬元，粳稻一五一五萬元，小麥二八〇〇萬元，白麥三〇八〇萬元，麵粉一一八〇萬元，荳油八三二〇萬元。棉紗十五億元。</p>
<p>成都　〔本報成都卅日電〕蓉銀根漸鬆，物價轉漲，卅日金銀布紗百貨報漲，新穀登塲，各地米價普穩。</p>
<p>重慶　〔本報重慶卅日電〕鈔荒暫可解決，八千億現鈔，卅日專機由滬運渝。</p>
<h3>食米臨收回堅　浦東新粳交易漸旺</h3>
<p>米市初跌後挺，終見稍漲，早開曾降落二百萬元，因去路甚呆，故見下降，中市因價低引起納胃，故稍見回升。北市白粳三千七百萬，特高粳爲三千九百萬元，南市薄稻三千八百萬，浦東新粳交易漸多，價分三千五至三千七百萬三級。各米至收市更堅，與上日不分上下，昨日到貨南北二市共計五三一六石。</p>
<p>麵粉　先疲後堅，終稱平定，開市價格甚低，至中途始見稍有去化，乃緩緩回升。老車粉由一千二百萬而至一千二百六十萬元，略較上日升二十萬，兵船粉一千一百六十五萬收市，市呈平定。紅蜂建成及雜牌粉均略見疲軟，麩皮挺二三十萬元。</p>
<p>雜糧　升沉不一，黃豆因存底不多，到貨不寂，况有客帮去化，乃吿挺升一百萬元。蠶豆銷路呆木，苟米及菉豆賣買俱少，市少升沉。元麥紅糧酌加五十萬，收市轉疲。芝蔴生仁各在客帮之納收下，挺升二三百萬一元。</p>
<p>食油　徐徐而升，因黃豆價格挺升，貨主扳持，廠方亦堅持喊高，而回籠棧單亦較稀，價乃吿上升。豆油初開七千九百萬，後逐步高至八千一百萬收市，較上日挺升四百萬，生菜油亦挺四百萬，生油漲七百萬，吉桶生油一億〇七百萬成交，小車蔴油出一億大關，猛挺一千萬。豆餅初平後堅，起伏狹隘，價無榮辱。</p>

<h3>世運田徑第一日黃兩正中欄落選　中欄複賽破世運紀錄</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕倫教卅日廣播：世運會正式比賽，今日開始，氣候酷然，達九十度，溫布萊田徑塲觀衆約計六萬餘人，游泳池較爲舒適，觀衆約計三千餘人。田徑第一日比賽中，中國選手黃兩正參加四百公尺中欄預賽第五組，列第四名落選。中欄複賽，美國柯克倫瑞典拉遜，俱以五十一秒九之成績，打破世運中攔紀錄。舊紀錄爲哈定之五十二秒。百公尺預賽，成績平平，女子二百公尺胸泳二組均破世運紀錄。</p>
<p>〔合衆社倫敦卅日電〕男子四百公尺中攔第五組結果如下：第一奧爾特（美），第二克洛斯（法），成績爲五十四秒又七。落選者如下：第三克里斯登（瑞士），第四黃兩正（中），第五馬陀斯（葡萄牙）。</p>
<p>我籃球隊改變戰略</p>
<p>〔中央社倫敦廿九日電〕本日上午據體育界人士稱：倘中國籃球隊隊員能如上週與其仙球隊作練習賽時情形相同，而有輝煌之演出，則中國籃球隊有百分之五十以上之機會，進入世運籃球賽之從半段。其他兩遠東籃球隊，爲菲律賓隊及韓國隊，僉信於爭取複賽權時，該兩隊將爲中國隊最頑强之敵手。在此同一組中，尙有伊拉克·智利·及比利時隊。廿八日下午中國隊於對匈牙利及瑞士作兩次十分鐘之練習賽時，表現頗爲强勁，分別以廿五對廿，及廿對十獲勝。中國籃球隊於週前抵此從，其隊員之之演出最佳，中國籃球隊員已放葉其一人釘一人之防衛戰術，而採取區肪守新戰略，即將對方主要人物包圍於此區之中心，而對付之，通常逼令此人越出綫外球區。此項區防守新戰略之變換，於上過之練習賽中，巳獲得相當成功。惟中國籃球隊之後備隊，表演較弱。</p>

<p>學校介紹</p>
<h3>北平鐵道學院</h3>
<p>— 正</p>
<p>當你走過府右街南口，或是經過李閣老胡同時，你會發現有一座高大的校門，那便是國立北平鐵道管理學院</p>
<p>論他的前身，原是北京交通大學，簡稱交大平院，與上海交大（簡稱交大滬校），唐山交大（簡稱交大唐院），有如三個弟兄，一脈相承。祇不過近來已分了家，獨立門戶罷了。</p>
<p>現在全校共分運輸，材料，財務，業務管理四系，共有學生四百餘人。所聘敎授多係國內知名之土或交通界老前輩，類皆學深德隆。課程方面，則理論與實際並重。在一年級除部定國文，英文，經濟學，物理學，微積分，工程圖書外，與普通學校不同的尙有會計學原理，經濟學原理。在二年級除公共必修之課程外，財務系則着重高等經濟，高等會計，財政學，公私理財，工商管理，貨幣銀行等。運輸系，則側重旅客運輸，貨物運輸等。三四年級則以貨車支配，運價，鐵道運轉，鐵道會計，車輛構造，道路工程等爲主要課程，</p>
<p>設備方面，除有規模不大不小的圖書館，足供同學實事求是的博覽研究，還有小型軌道，機車，橋樑涵洞，號誌，車站等設備，俾同學一方面從事理論探討，一方面得以實際實習，因為人數不多，學生的宿舍至為寬敞，很大的房間，普通只居兩三個人。所以他們時常說：「在北平的各大學中，住的問題，我們可以說是最愜意的了。」</p>
<p>爲培養鐵路中級幹部，除了大學部分外，還附股一個中等技術科在西城王府倉胡同，內分鐵道行車，電信，業務三班，三年畢業。他們的課程，有很多都是大學部分的，所以雖是規定初中畢業報考，而高中生也大有其人。不過，中技科不招收女生，這未免有點那個！</p>
<p>今年招考新生，本來時間在七月中，後因老塲發生問題，遲延要到八月中旬，本年招生僅設上海北平兩區，上海區假國立上海商學院，報名日期係八月九日十日十一日。</p>
<p>這個學校有一個大的好處，就是學生出路沒有問題。本屆畢業生，已全部就了業，有的甚至有幾個位置，任自己選擇。</p>
<p>靑年朋友們，假如你們願意獻身交通，爲建設新中國而努力的話，請好好的準備來吧！</p>
<h3>世運大會開幕盛典我代表團雄姿煥發　容啓兆宋君領導黃天錫持旗</h3>
<p>〔中央社倫敦廿九日電〕第十四屆世界運動會，廿九日午後在溫布萊運動塲舉行開幕典禮，着藍上衣白長褲精神煥發之我國四十四名代表，於遶塲一週行經英皇室看台前時，八萬與會觀衆，咸報以歡呼，我代表隊山足球隊領隊容啓兆及籃球隊敎練宋君復領先，自東部地下走道入口處，步入會塲，高大壯碩身長六英尺三吋之我籃球隊從衛黃天錫，手執我國國旗，我全體代表分爲雙行，魚貫其後，我代表隊人塲後，即按字母先後次序，列爲第十四隊，美國選手隊人數最多，共四百人，最少者爲新加坡之一人隊，我總幹事董守義於全體選手輝煌行列繞塲一週後，即興世運委員會其他委員同時入塲，立於皇家看台之前。今日氣候極熱，觀衆昏倒者不下十餘人，但英國社交界人士，仍盛裝入塲，男士着燕尾服，女士則長裙曳地，蓋英國之任何盛大遝動會，俱爲社交塲合，而英皇英后之蒞止，更使世運會在社交方面，獲得極高之地位。</p>
<p>開幕曲禮寫真</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社倫敦廿九日電〕今日下午第十四屆世運會舉行開幕典禮，溫布萊運動塲華麗莊嚴廣闊玫現紅色之跑道，興平坦嫩綠色草塲周圍，飄揚着各國五彩國旗，揭幕典禮開始時，首由着　色服戴能熊皮帽之近衛軍前導，在地下隧道口出現，其後爲金服紫帽之國王禁衛軍，再後爲蘇格蘭管樂馬，戴高帽之國際奧林匹克委員會，委員入席後，官塲人士艾德禮·艾登，法義荷比智利諸國外使，瑪麗王太后，各國王室，蒙巴頓黝爵夫婦，聯合國秘書長賴伊等，在軍樂聲中紛紛入座。在英王喬治偕御眷蒞塲時，全塲頓然靜默起立，軍樂隊奏英國國歌，在國王接見奧林匹克委員會委員時，王后即偕瑪格麗公主步入御用包廂，運動員檢閱式立即開始，由希臘運動員前導，各國健兒均由本國國旗領先，運動員穿燈龍褲，着各種色彩不同之運動衫與帽子，各國運動員隊伍經過御座前，均下旗致敬，澳洲與菲律濱代表更脫帽致敬，周　　聲不絕。運動員檢閱歷四十分錡，最後爲英國隊。撿閱從，各國運動員即面對英王列隊，英王喬洽用擴音器莊重宣稱：「余宣佈一九四八年度現代之第十四屆世界運動會開幕。」白鴿千頭，盤旋運動塲上空，後即飛向各地，傳遍運動會揭幕之消息。接着鳴禮砲二十一響，英國健兒約翰馬克，在最末一響禮砲聲中，執奧林匹克火炬抵塲，繞塲一週後，即用火炸燃起運動場左方之奧林匹克燈。在紐克主敎之祝詞後，英國世運　將芬萊即代表全體運動員宣誓稱：「爲國家與運動之光榮，必在運動中表示忠心。」世運揭幕典禮，即在全體觀衆合唱英國國歌聲中完成。觀衆魚貫退出運動塲，各國健兒亦各歸營室，準備明日厮殺。按目羅馬尼亞與保加利亞退出世運後，目前參加大會者，共五十九國。</p>

<p>自由談</p>
<h3>多餘的「討好」</h3>
<p>— 靖文</p>
<p>我相信隊了苦修主義派的信從外，對於改善人類生活的享受，普通人大概是不會反對的。文化與文明的終極目的，也不外是改善與提高人類的生活水準。因此，我們人的生活條件雖遠談不到舒服，但對於一切有益於生活舒服的社會改進措置，那怕我無福享受，始終以一們旁觀者的地位表示贊助。即使是近乎豪奢的行爲，祇要是合理的，也深願樂觀其成。</p>
<p>譬如說旅行罷，在此遍地條火，滿目災黎的今日，苛刻一些說，旅行該說是一種近乎奢侈的事受了。惟鄙意却絕不作如是觀，而認爲雖然在此亂世，祇要個人的力量辦得到，而良心上亦沒有甚麼內疚，則偶然來一次週末旅行之類，實亦未可厚非。何况蒼狗白雲，人壽幾何，及時享樂，亦自有一種精神上的需要。一個人有了「銅板」而肯在比較有意義的享樂上「用脫兩鈿一，此人總算尙懂得做人的道理。</p>
<p>旅行旣是一種享樂，有關旅行的一切設施，自當力求考究，務期做到旅客樂於化錢而無怨言，反之，經營旅行事業的機關，則當然應以賺錢爲目的，如此始得謂爲公平交易。歐洲有許多國家，便視辦理旅行事業爲外匯收入的大宗來源，例如英國戰從下水的那艘豪華船伊莉沙白皇后號，即以服務美國的豪客，以之換取美圓爲目的。故該船不僅內部裝飾華麗，且其供給飲食之豪奢，甚至引起英國議會的責問。因爲目前英國全國人民悉受配給生活所支配，如果星期日的早餐席上能多一隻鷄蛋，已認爲是了不得的享受了。而現在專供美國豪客享樂的那艘豪華船上，且不說鷄蛋奶油應有盡有，且還備有鹿脯呢！可是英國政府當局的答覆，則謂英國苟欲爭取外匯，就不得不先緊束自已的褲帶。</p>
<p>我國今日的情形自然不能與英國相比，因爲那邊雖然在束緊袴帶，同時却已實行了自搖籃至墳基的國民社會保險法，假使我也是英國人，不要說束緊袴帶沒有半句怨言，就是非餓死不可，實在也是甘願的，因爲生在一個確有希望的國家中，個人的犧牲實在是一種有價値的貢獻。</p>
<p>話說遠了，且再說旅行吧。這使我想起最近兩路當局大事宣傳中的所謂「冷氣火車」（據說現已改稱爲飛快車了）。在我國的交通事業中，除郵政事業巳成衆口交譽之外，鐵道事業亦不能抹殺其相當功績，尤其是戰區中的鐵路搶修隊，其工作的精神與能力，曾博得中外好譽。即就京滬滬杭兩路局言，至少就其二三年來所宣傳的功績看，亦自有其進步之處。</p>
<p>但這次的「冷氣火車」，鄙意終以爲是一種多餘的「討好」。火車而有冷氣設備，美國的「普爾蒙」恐怕早已有之了。不過美國是美國，美國的普遍生產能力，已使若干浪費變成一種必要的消費，譬如我們在喫戶口糖，他們則男女老少人各一口「留蘭香」，如果美國人再不浪費些，那就與不免是「作孽」了。</p>
<p>然而我們究竟不同。用火車的等級來比擬我們與美國之間的國民經濟，我們能夠擠上「國際列車」的三四等車地位已經夠好了。我們今天需要的不是甚麼冷氣火車，而是能在四等車上多開幾個窗洞，在鐵篷車上多加一個車蓋。即使說我們現在的技術能力己足能造冷氣火車（據試騐的結果即此尙是問題），實際上也還用不着，因爲在行駛時的火車，祗要打開車窗，亦已夠風涼了。現在特地要關緊了車窗採用冷氣設備，豈非跡近浪費—而且是不合理的浪費？</p>
<p>退一步言，即使承認冷氣火車有其需要，但這種需要當然是屬少數特殊人物的，而爲國營事業的利益蓋想，理應使其價格提高到合理的程度。然而據傳現在的最高票價不過値美金一圓左右。這個數目在普通人目中自然是夠大的了，但要知交通事業的許多材料，都是用國家的外匯購來的。外人對於我國若千以外匯資材所經營的國營企業，不能爲政府賺錢而反令政府蝕本，最近巳迭有批評。據說自上海至南京一八〇哩距離的臥車，其票價僅相當美金八角，再如從上海搭中航機赴香港，所費約美金十六圓，而自香港搭同機返滬，則以港幣計算約需美金七十圓。足見英國人實在此我們精明得多了。</p>
<p>本文的目的不是在提倡高物似，惟對於非「大衆可坐」的東西，而又需要以外匯維持其事業者，則認爲必須求其定價的合理化。否則眞未免太爲富人打算了。電影院的限價座政策，理應亦施之於若干國營事業。</p>
<h3>日記文學</h3>
<p>— 錢大成</p>
<p>最早的日記恐怕是黃山谷的「家乘」吧？據陸放翁「老學庵筆記」裏說：「黃魯直有日記，謂之家乘，至宜州猶不輟書。」其他如范成大的「吳船錄」，陸放翁的「入蜀記」，都用日記的體裁來記事。但正式用日記的名字，恐怕是元朝郭天錫的「客杭日記」。後來又有人改稱「日譜」，如明代朱祖文的「北行日譜」。也有人稱「日錄」。</p>
<p>到了淸末，日記大盛而特盛，政治家，理學家，文學家，都有日記，有的數十年始終無間斷。最有名當然是曾文正公日記，王壬秋「湘綺樓日記」，李　客一越縵堂日記」，葉昌熾「綠督廬日記鈔」，翁同龢日記，趙烈文有五十四册「能靜居日記」，其中很多太平天國的史料，可惜沒有付印，就被他的兒子賣掉了。袁世凱段祺瑞都有日記。去年我在蘇州，遇到段老的女公子繹之女士（她是袁世凱姪孫媳。）她曾提起，還允許借我一閱。「越縵堂日記」被樊樊山藏匿數册，已不算足本，稿本也已被浙江興業銀行某君買去。「綠督廬日記鈔」原已删去許多米鹽瑣屑和駡人的部分，剩下的只是論板本碑帖和記述考試做官而已。記述米鹽瑣屑和駡人，最能現出作者的眞性情，買櫝還珠，眞是可惜。幸而原稿本已於去年捐入蘇州省立岡書館，盧山眞面，不難覆按。其他如郁達夫的「日記九種」，徐志摩的「愛眉小札」，鄭振鐸的「求書日錄」，………都很有風趣，或是有學術上的價値。陶孟和校印的華學瀾「辛丑日記」，記載淸季考試實情，特別詳細，考官向地方官索取陋規，居然認作正項收入，斤斤較量，毫不慚愧；考官借債赴任，回來竟有百件上下行李，旁人也視爲當然，恬不爲怪。這種實情，從官樣文章裏邊是決不能見到的。日記的可貴，即在於此。我也已記了好多年日記，偶一翻閱，前塵夢影，有如隔世。看到日記上記載的前數年的物價，同今年的物價一比，覺得以前的日子實在太好過，然而現在却也能渡過。後之視今，猶今之視昔。所以我對於未來並不悲觀。看了昔人的日記，也不算想「乾嘉盛世」；因爲「乾嘉盛世」的人，在日記裏也在愁風愁雨愁米愁鹽了</p>
<h3>談警句</h3>
<p>— 寄漠</p>
<p>有一類讀者歡喜讀「警句」，因此有一些作家也不惜刻意求工，專以撰寫警句爲能事。一篇文字中，如自首至尾，均平平淡淡，或空空洞洞，讀者固然提不起興趣，我想在這夏日炎炎正好眠的天氣下，那位作家寫了一半不打瞌睡，才是怪事。</p>
<p>據說，美國的出版界很注重生意眼，尤其一些偵探神怪之類的書，莫不以警句紛呈，吸引讀者。我曾經讀了不少這一類的書。這裏，因爲我在朋友處一張寫字桌上撰文，無法徵引原書，姑仿其大意，謬擬幾個例子。</p>
<p>這一類句子，往往安插在每一章的開端，使人一卷在手，愛不忍釋。譬如我們在一本偵探小說上，可以唸到類似下列的文字</p>
<p>「在一條黑　　的深巷內，有一個人影在蠕動。」</p>
<p>「跳舞場內的圓桌上，發現一封沒有署名的信，不知是誰送來的。</p>
<p>「身材高大的卡爾，背上被一把匕首刺中，倒了下</p>
<p>「約翰正在伏案擬一封信稿，猛的抬頭一看，發現</p>
<p>桌前站着一個險色慘淡的女人。」</p>
<p>自然，警句也可安排在一篇文章的結尾，令人讀後餘味無窮。不論任何作品，作者在結尾寫得好，更易使讀者念念不忘。例如毛罕在人生紀事的一篇小說，於叙述一個富家子弟在蒙晚卡羅的一番冒險經歷後，臨末說一個人用不到天資聰穎，只要運氣好就行。有時看看許多懷才不遇的人，頗爲嗟嘆。又我國俗諺云「呆人有呆福」，覺得毛罕這句話倒很有幾分意思。而人生將一切都寄托在幸運上，却未免太無憑藉了。</p>
<h3>領事女皇</h3>
<p>— 毛毅</p>
<p>十餘年前，有一個舞臺上的女演員來到影都好萊塢，但是，每一家攝影塲都饗她以閉門羹。銀星夢碎了，在窮極無聊之中，她想起在旅途中遇到的一個以銷售領帶爲生的女子。何不如法泡製呢？於是，她僱用了一個裁製各色領帶的女工，開始在洛杉磯和好萊塢推銷出品。</p>
<p>生意意外的好，第一批出品很快的賣完。同時，她又發現以領帶商的身份進入攝影塲是一件極輕易的事。憑着她的伶俐，才幹，和優良的出品，導演，演員，編劇等各色電影工作人員都成了她的主顧。到現在，影都人士都親暱的稱她爲一領帶女皇。」</p>
<p>這位專做男性生意的「女皇」是蓓麗·格林小姐。她差不多成了影都的特約服裝人員，因爲演員的領帶大半都是向她買的。她熟知大明星喜愛何種花式的領帶，她並且吿訴他們那種領帶配那種衣服。</p>
<p>別小覷一根領帶，它也曾在影都引起過風波呢！當伊文比契爾做演員時，有一次正在拍戲之際，他的岳父來看他。伊文結着一根格林小姐的黑白條子領帶，他的岳父見了喜愛不已，伊文爲了承歡起見，便在戲拍完後立即送給了他。這位老泰山歡天喜地的結了新領帶趕回家去炫耀。不幸，這時公司忽然在試片時覺得有不滿意的地方，便命令伊文去重拍一段。可是，領帶沒有了啊！更不幸的是，當時格林又外去，而相同的領帶更無處可覓！</p>
<p>當重拍時，伊文爲了不使領帶的差異暴露起見，手部差不多遮在喉嚨上。自此以後，影片公司便制定了一條規則：各頃服裝在影片攝竣後憑保藏三個月—假如格林小姐做了「電影女皇」而不是「領帶女皇」，她恐怕倒未必會有如此的權威吧！</p>

<h3>New Financial Measures Discussed and Decided in Moganshan; President Weng and Finance Minister Wang Return to Nanjing</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Nanjing, 30th] President of the Executive Yuan Weng Wenhao, Foreign Minister Wang Shijie, Finance Minister Wang Yunwu, Finance Vice-Minister Xu Boyuan, and Chairman of the US Aid Utilization Committee Yan Jiagan, among others, flew to Hangzhou on the 29th at the President's invitation to visit him on Moganshan. They flew back to Nanjing on the "Ziqiang" special plane at 7 PM on the 30th. When Weng and others left Moganshan on the 30th, they visited the President again at 10 AM for further discussions for about two hours, providing detailed reports and requests for instructions on certain economic and financial measures. After having lunch at the Moganshan Hotel, they went down the mountain at 1:30 PM. They took a short tour of West Lake around 4 PM, visited Lingyin Temple, and then took off from Jianqiao Airport at 6 PM, returning to Nanjing. The issues reported and requested instructions on by President Weng and others were the execution of the national budget, especially how to coordinate with the budget passed by the Legislative Yuan based on the current state of national revenue and expenditure after the Legislative Yuan completed its review of the budget. In addition, Yan Jiagan also gave a report on the use of US aid, and discussed how to properly use it to absorb a large amount of legal tender, and concrete decisions have been made. As for financial controls, it was also decided in principle to continue strengthening implementation to achieve the effect of balancing revenue and expenditure and stabilizing the economy.</p>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Nanjing, 30th] In order to balance revenue and expenditure, stabilize the currency, and effectively execute the national budget, the government has decided to take emergency financial measures in the short term. These measures have become concrete and mature after President Weng and others visited the President on the mountain. When Weng and others returned to Nanjing from the mountain, all the key officials kept the matters decided on the mountain strictly confidential. However, the reporter repeatedly inquired of President Weng at the airport, and Weng admitted that "there will be news in the short term." According to sources from authoritative circles: Under the current objective circumstances, there must be measures taken in finance, the current budget revenue and expenditure cannot be balanced, the cost of living index is increasing monthly, the numbers are very large, and the budget passed by the Legislative Yuan is in fact not enough to maintain for too long, and there must be new measures to meet the needs. It is heard that this measure will still start from financial policies in general, and there will be appropriate countermeasures against speculative capital. As for the reform of the currency system, it is currently making a lot of noise, but there must be a preparatory stage, and the government must have sufficient power to control it before it can start. If the preliminary preparations are confident, the reform of the currency system can be carried out.</p>
<p>Also, the reporter asked Finance Minister Wang at the airport: It is rumored that the Moganshan meeting has decided to reform the currency system and will start implementing it immediately. Is this true? Wang repeatedly said, "Not true! Not true!"</p>

The work of these two months has been the most important preparation work of our Yuan, and it can also be said to be the reform work of the supervisory system. Now the meeting has come to an end. Although the general meeting says that it can be temporarily recessed, our recess is not a cessation of work, but the beginning of supervisory work. The members of the administrative office have been selected, and the various committees have also been formed. I hope everyone will work together with the spirit of the past two months to eliminate corrupt elements who harm the country and the nation as much as possible and establish a good foundation for constitutional government.

The general meeting decided to hand it over to the Foreign Affairs, Overseas Chinese Affairs and Education Committee and the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Committee for review. Finally, the chairman announced that in accordance with the resolution of the 66th meeting, the administrative offices and inspection groups were established at the same time. Now all the members of the administrative offices have been selected, but the organization of the inspection group is still pending due to budget allocation and work plan issues. Can it be submitted to the August meeting for discussion? The commissioners present unanimously passed the motion without objection. At this point, the 56-day meeting came to an end.</p>

The technical issues of the implementation of the general budget in the future must be reported to the President for instructions, so I came here specifically. As for the use of US aid, it has been clearly stipulated in the Sino-US bilateral agreement. Among them, there are departments that our country can freely use. Currently, 125 million US dollars have officially started to be used. Recently, domestic prices have stabilized. The reporter then asked whether legal tender will be replaced by Customs Gold Units. He said: Customs Gold Units and legal tender are already one. The government has no intention of replacing it.

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Shattering Illusions About the Chinese Communists</h3>
<p>Since the Chinese Communists published their "Resolution Agreeing with the Comintern Information Bureau's Criticism of the Yugoslav Communists," it has long been clear to the world whether the Chinese Communists have any concept of the state or any national consciousness. However, the so-called "Third Force" in Peiping and Hong Kong are still spreading rumors of resuming peace talks and the so-called "New Political Consultative Conference." Allied friends are also discussing the Chinese Communists' appeal for relief from the Yellow River disaster issued by the secret radio station of the Chinese Communists in North China, saying either that the Chinese Communists will follow in the footsteps of Yugoslav Marshal Tito or that the Chinese Communists are about to split internally. It seems that Chinese and foreign people have not yet clearly recognized the true face of the Chinese Communists. In order to clarify the public's view, President Weng issued a "Clearly Distinguishing Right from Wrong and Jointly Facing National Crisis" message to the people of the whole country on the 28th. In addition to exposing the Chinese Communists' hideous face of betraying the country, he also encouraged the people of the whole country to jointly face the national crisis with "At this juncture of survival, there is no room for ambiguity or hesitation." Although the full text is tens of thousands of words long, it is simple, clear, and righteous. It is indeed President Weng's most important message since he took office. This is not only valued by the international community, but also unanimously supported by the government and the public.</p>
<p>Some people comment on state affairs, always thinking that the root of the problem for the many troubles lies in the government. It seems that the current social unrest and economic depression are all caused by the suppression of the rebellion. Why can't the government avoid this kind of war to suppress the rebellion? On the contrary, the Chinese Communists' sabotage and harassment are not discussed. It is not known that the great disease of China today lies in "unclear right and wrong, unclear black and white." Taking the nature of the Chinese Communists as an example, everyone knows the characteristics of the Communist Party, which lies not in having communism, but in its class struggle and obeying the command of the Comintern. In the past, a part of the people, especially some Allied friends, held illusions about the nature of the Chinese Communist Party, mistakenly believing that the Chinese Communists also have a concept of the state and a national consciousness, but only advocated land reform. Because of the existence of this illusion, the Chinese Communists were regarded as an ordinary political party. Although our government knew the fallacy of this view, it also had the mentality of being kind to people and was willing to negotiate with them, trying to organize the so-called "Coalition Government." This illusion not only affected the general public at that time, but also lingered for a long time, and was used by the Chinese Communists to cultivate their strength as much as possible and expand their territory as much as possible. Although the government has now realized it, it is too late to regret, raising a tiger to cause trouble and making a big mistake. Anyone who understands the course of the peace talks cannot but admit the mistakes of the illusions at that time. Even the Allied friends who firmly advocated the organization of a coalition government in China at that time, after the coup in Czechoslovakia, were also suddenly enlightened.</p>
<p>We are not afraid of making mistakes, but we are afraid of not waking up. However, some professional politicians know that the Chinese Communists are a branch of the Comintern, and have no national consciousness and no concept of the state. They know that the Chinese Communists are a political party of violent dictatorship, and there is no democracy or freedom to speak of. However, they are still praising "New Democracy." When they occasionally hear the rumors of convening a "New Political Consultative Conference," they are overjoyed and rush to tell each other, thinking that the Chinese Communists will organize a "Coalition Government" with them, and they can get a half-official position. They also heard the Chinese Communists' radio broadcast of the "National Capital" lie, and they vigorously campaigned for the Chinese Communists to the industrial and commercial circles, sending secret signals, thinking that after the Chinese Communists seized power, the industrial and commercial circles could still do business and production as usual. Although these deceptive words are ridiculous and laughable, because the society does not distinguish between right and wrong, and does not distinguish between black and white, there are still quite a few people who are misled and deceived. Now, President Weng's message directly pointed out: "Since the Chinese Communists have agreed to the Comintern's condemnation of the Yugoslav Communists for promoting nationalism, they themselves have fundamentally denied nationalism. Since the Chinese Communists have agreed to the Comintern's opposition to the Yugoslav Communists allowing representatives of the petty bourgeoisie, peasants, and workers to represent the whole country instead of the one-party dictatorship of the Communist Party, the "Democratic Coalition Government" they are calling for is fundamentally a smokescreen for their political conspiracy; Since the Chinese Communists have agreed to the Comintern's attack on the Yugoslav Communists for deviating from Marxism-Leninism and allowing private ownership of land and people to freely buy and sell land, the Chinese Communists' propaganda to appease the rich peasants and stabilize the middle peasants is naturally an empty slogan; Since the Chinese Communists have also agreed to the Comintern's condemnation of the Yugoslav Communists for making individual economy prevalent throughout the country, the Chinese Communists' claim to protect urban industry and commerce is even more a shameless trick." The true face of the Chinese Communists has been completely exposed in President Weng's writing. The expansion of the Chinese Communists' power today is entirely based on its tricks. However, the tricks of the conjurer can only be joked, and cannot be taken seriously. The trick of "covering the ears and eyes of the world" will eventually be exposed, and this time, it is not President Weng who exposed the Chinese Communists' mask, but the leading figures of the Chinese Communists themselves! Not only those who had illusions about the Chinese Communists in the past now know that they are bubbles, but also the blindly following Chinese Communist members, especially the young people with a little national consciousness and concept of the state, will also be able to wake up and return from the wrong path. If they resolutely reform themselves, the government will be able to especially forgive them and allow them to return to the embrace of the motherland and become democratic and free citizens under the constitutional government.</p>

<p>[Our Shenyang Dispatch, 30th] Layman visited Wei Lihuang at 10 am on the 30th. After talking for 20 minutes, he visited Dong Wenqi. Dong first presented the difficult situation in Shenyang. The main food for most citizens is soybean cake, soybean residue, tree leaves, and grass roots. As a result, the number of patients dying has increased. He also presented food samples for Layman to visit. Layman expressed his deep sympathy, but said: US aid is used to increase production. Fushun can get relief.

<p>[Our Shenyang Dispatch, 30th] Legislator Wang Huayi visited Layman on the 30th and stated his opinions: (1) For US aid to China, North China should be more important than South China, and Northeast China should be more important than North China.

<h3>Taiwan Shipping Industry Responds to Boycott Japanese Ships Coming to China</h3>
<p>[Our Taipei Dispatch, 30th] The Shanghai shipping industry decided to boycott Japanese ships that would come to China and infringe on shipping rights and compete for materials.

According to reports from the Joint Provincial Shipping Industry, if the government does not take effective measures to prohibit it, Japanese ships coming to China will hit the development of the Joint Shipping Industry. It is decided to support the measures of the Shanghai Shipping Industry and implement them thoroughly. That is: (1) Block Japanese ships and prohibit imports, even at the cost of sacrifice. (2) Prohibit workers from loading and unloading, and the workers' losses will be compensated by the shipping companies. The Taiwan shipping industry also stated that in the future, Taiwan Sugar and Taiwan Salt's transportation and sales to Japan should be transported by provincial shipping vessels, and Japanese companies should be rejected from transporting them themselves.</p>

<p>The Cause of the Civilian Airline Plane Crash in Qingdao May Be an Oil Tank Explosion</p>
<h3>Director of the Airline Returns to Shanghai from Qingdao for Investigation</h3>
<p>[Our Qingdao Dispatch, 30th] The cause of the C46 transport plane of the Civilian Aviation Team that crashed and burned at Cang Kou Airport at 5 pm on the 29th has not yet been found. It is estimated that it may be a fire caused by an oil tank explosion. The entire contents of the plane were munitions, so it was immediately burned and could not be rescued. The plane carried 16 officers and soldiers of the 57th Brigade, with a load of 46,140 pounds and 700 gallons of oil in the fuel tank. According to Green, the main driver who had driven the plane, the plane had flown to Jinan three times and had never found any obstacles.

In addition to the pilot and co-pilot and the radio operator, the plane carried 16 officers and soldiers of a certain unit who were going to Jinan, 700 gallons of gasoline, and military equipment. All the personnel on the plane have now died. The exact cause of the accident is still under investigation.</p>
<h3>We Ask the Allied Headquarters to Extradite Ying Zuo as Soon as Possible</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 30th] The Legal Affairs Group of the Chinese Mission to Japan here has again asked the Allied Headquarters to extradite Japanese war criminal Ying Zuo Zhenzhao as soon as possible and hand him over to the Chinese government for trial in China. Chief Shang Zhen sent a letter to MacArthur half a month ago, requesting prompt action. Ying Zuo was a well-known Japanese intelligence officer. After Wang Ni Jingwei fled Chongqing during the war, he personally took Wang Ni from Hanoi to Shanghai. The Allied Headquarters' Legal Affairs Bureau is obviously not enthusiastic about China's repeated requests, and is delaying the matter on the grounds that Ying Zuo's health is not good and he is not suitable for foreign travel. Because China's war criminal trial work will end at the end of September this year, the Chinese Legal Affairs Group here is eager to extradite the most important last name on the list of Japanese war criminal suspects to China for trial in time. The person in charge of the group told reporters yesterday: The Chinese government is prepared to send Chinese doctors to Japan to check Ying Zuo's health in order to find out whether he is really as Japanese doctors claim that he is not suitable for travel. China will not let go of Ying Zuo. If it cannot extradite him, the Chinese authorities will organize a separate military commission to try him in Japan.</p>
<h3>Japanese Fishing Boats Invade Territorial Waters from Time to Time off the Coast of Qinghai</h3>

<h3>The Capital High Court Tries Fraud Case Using Audio Recordings as Evidence</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 30th] It is the first time in our judicial circles that the Capital High Court used open audio recordings as evidence to try a case on the 30th. According to Zhao Qibin and Zhao Qihao brothers, the managers of the Taili Cafe on Zhongshan Road in Beijing, after the victory, they borrowed 5,000 US dollars, 26 pounds, and a 6-carat diamond ring from Lin Shurong, a Fuzhou native. Later, in Shanghai, they only returned the diamond ring after drinking and cheated the representative of Lin to get the IOU. After refusing to admit the loan, Lin sued Zhao and others for fraud in the local court. Because there was no IOU, the local court ruled not guilty. Lin claimed that the loss was worth hundreds of millions, so he filed an appeal and discovered new evidence. Because of the production of audio recordings, the use of audio recordings at the court session on the 30th was of great help to the whole case, and it is expected that the truth will be revealed soon.</p>

<h3>Chen Lifu Visits Marshall Twice in the United States to Discuss Steps for Military Aid to China; Also Meets with Truman to Discuss China Issues</h3>
<p>[Special Correspondent of This Newspaper, Washington, 21st Dispatch] Since arriving in the United States, Chen Lifu, Deputy Speaker of the Legislative Yuan, has met with General Marshall twice and contacted several key officials of the State Department. People in the American diplomatic circles have a fresh impression of Chen's visit to the United States, recognizing Chen's sincerity in loving his country and his frankness. Yesterday, Chen met with President Truman at the White House the day before his departure for England, and discussed China issues. After leaving, Chen told reporters that he had informed the President that the situation in China was quite serious. The Communists obtained a steady supply from the Northeast. The large-scale arsenal and excellent military supplies left by Japan in Shenyang have been destroyed and seized by the Communists, and their rebellion is expanding daily. Therefore, what China needs now is rapid military assistance. President Truman is very understanding and sympathetic to the China issue and agreed that China needs rapid military assistance.</p>
<p>The content of Chen's two meetings with Secretary of State Marshall is kept secret, but reporters learned from American sources in Washington that Chen had suggested to Secretary Marshall that the China issue was even more serious than the situation in Berlin. He said that there are now more than one million armed Communists in China, and if China turns red, India, Burma, Vietnam, Malaya, and other countries will inevitably be affected. Chen also pointed out that the threat of communism is a global problem, and local solutions can only make the pressure on other parts heavier.</p>
<p>The second meeting between Marshall and Chen lasted 75 minutes. Secretary Marshall analyzed in detail the reasons for the slow progress of American aid to China, mainly due to the complicated legislative procedures in the United States, which cannot be accommodated. According to rumors from relevant sources in Washington, the second meeting between Marshall and Chen involved specific steps for American military aid to China. Ambassador Wellington Koo was also present, and Ambassador Koo repeatedly emphasized "Military aid to China must be rapid." As for financial aid to China and monetary reform, it is believed that Marshall and Chen did not mention it, because some members of the financial aid to China technical team led by Bei Zuyi are still stationed here. Relevant American diplomatic officials also said that Chen Lifu did not discuss any financial aid to China matters with Marshall.</p>
<p>Chen is scheduled to leave the United States for England today. During his stay in the United States, he visited the Los Angeles City Council, the Senate and House of Representatives in Washington, and visited the Democratic and Republican Party Conventions in Philadelphia. He is deeply interested in the current democratic system in the United States.</p>
<p>Bevin Warmly Receives Chen</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, London, 30th] Chen Lifu was warmly received by Bevin at the British Foreign Office yesterday. Chen also met with Attlee, Eden, and other senior British government officials at the banquet of Viscount Portal yesterday afternoon, and is scheduled to visit Mrs. Cripps today.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, London, 29th] Chen Lifu, Deputy Speaker of the Chinese Legislative Yuan, said that China is now fighting against communism, and if Britain fully understands China's intention, not only for its own sake, it will come out to help China. He believes that the whole world will give China assistance. If China fails in this struggle, Malaya will also be lost. China's failure is also Britain's failure, because if Asia is communized, Britain will encounter many dangers.</p>

<h3>Molotov Excuses Himself with Vacation, Three Envoys Blocked from Meeting, Possible Direct Negotiation with Stalin, British Foreign Secretary Announces in House of Commons No Sidestepping Soviet Warning</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper] New York, 30th Broadcast: According to Washington news, the State Department has just received a report from the US Embassy in the Soviet Union stating that just as the ambassadors of the United Kingdom, the United States and France to the Soviet Union were planning to submit a note to Molotov to discuss the Berlin issue, Molotov suddenly announced that he was taking a vacation and refused to meet. It is speculated in diplomatic circles here that the three major governments may therefore negotiate directly with Stalin. However, the State Department did not comment on this refusal, and said that it had not yet formally received a report on this matter.</p>
<p>[This Newspaper] London, 30th Broadcast: The envoys of the United States, the United Kingdom, and France today asked the Soviet Foreign Ministry to meet with Molotov in order to submit the Western countries' resolution on the Berlin issue to the Soviet side. Roberts and French Ambassador Chataigneau had dinner with Smith last night for a half-hour private conversation. Roberts and Smith personally informed Chataigneau of information about the London Conference.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 29th] According to well-informed sources: The procedure agreed upon by the Western Allies for new actions towards Moscow regarding the Berlin issue is for the three envoys to send a memorandum to Molotov, and then request an audience with Stalin to discuss Berlin and general European peace issues. The saying published in American newspapers that the three Western envoys had abandoned their plan to directly meet with Stalin has been deemed inaccurate by well-informed sources.</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 29th] The United States, the United Kingdom, and France are using the latest strategy to negotiate with the Soviet Union. After the blockade of Berlin was broken, the State Department on the 29th quietly waited for Moscow's response. It can be inferred that the West decided on this strategy to measure the cost of the Soviet Union lifting the blockade and whether negotiations can be conducted accordingly. Authoritative sources also declared, "The basic policy of the Western countries has not changed much. The purpose of our policy is still to lift the blockade of Berlin."</p>
<p>[United Press, London, 30th] British Foreign Secretary Bevin seized the initiative in the Cold War from other Western countries and placed the choice of war or peace before Stalin. Bevin warned Stalin on the 29th with the strongest and most direct official document since the war that Britain had decided to take steps in two areas. He made it clear that what is happening now depends on Stalin's choice. (1) If the Berlin blockade is not removed, the situation may lead to war. In any case, Britain may stop its demobilization plan and re-examine all its military strength and policies. (2) If the blockade is lifted, Britain will participate in four-power negotiations. Bevin's speech was in fact a British version of the preview of the statements made by the three envoys when they met with Molotov on behalf of the West. Bevin's words clearly show that the West has encountered the worst situation since Munich and has decided to stand firm and not retreat. Western officials are half optimistic and half pessimistic about this new policy.</p>
<h3>Representatives from Ten Countries Gather in Belgrade to Discuss Danube River Navigation, Yugoslav Foreign Minister Presides Over Opening Ceremony, Strict Security Measures</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper] New York, 30th Broadcast: The Danube River Conference was held at 4:00 PM today in the assembly hall of the Kolarac University, presided over by the Yugoslav Foreign Minister.</p>
<p>[United Press, Belgrade, 30th] Since the four foreign ministers' conference broke up unhappily in December last year, the East and West sides met here for the first time today to hold the Danube River Conference. Countries on both sides of the Iron Curtain are trying to create a new Danube River regime to control the river at this conference. Among the relevant European countries, the United States, the Soviet Union, the United Kingdom, and France all have representatives in attendance. Armed guards patrol back and forth outside the hotels where the representatives are staying, and the signs of sickles and hoes are on shops and public buildings. The Western representatives are US Ambassador to Yugoslavia Cannon, British Ambassador Peake, and French Ambassador Tillet. The focus of all parties is on whether South Korea will still vote with the Soviet Union regardless of the attacks by the Communist Information Bureau. The Western position is as follows: some countries enjoy special privileges in the southern part of the river, which prevents companies from other countries from traveling in the area.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Belgrade, 29th] High-ranking officials from the Soviet Union and South Korea met for the first time today since the Tito dispute. Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Vyshinsky arrived here from Moscow today to attend the opening of the Danube River Conference tomorrow. South Korean Foreign Minister Shemik and Deputy Foreign Minister Beberle personally welcomed him at the airport. Czech Foreign Minister Clementis, who came with Vyshinsky, smiled at Shemik and said, "I brought you a distinguished guest." When the senior officials from the Soviet Union and South Korea shook hands and exchanged greetings, British embassy staff who were waiting at the airport for the British ambassador also participated in the polite greetings of the senior officials from the Soviet Union and South Korea. Romanian Foreign Minister Anna Pauker also arrived here today.</p>
<h3>South Korean Politburo, Tito Elected Secretary-General</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Belgrade, 29th] The South Korean Central Committee today re-elected Tito as Secretary-General of the South Korean Politburo.

<h3>Hungarian Prime Minister Resigns</h3>
<p>Because His Son-in-Law Was Arrested on Charges of Treason</p>
<p>[This Newspaper] New York, 30th Broadcast: The Hungarian Prime Minister resigned. The United States believes that it was because of his pro-British and American stance that the Communist Party was consistently excluding dissidents in Eastern Europe.</p>
<p>[This Newspaper] New York, 30th Broadcast: Budapest News: Hungarian Prime Minister Dinnyés submitted his resignation after a cabinet meeting today because his son-in-law was arrested on charges of treason. Observers here generally believe that the person who will succeed Dinnyés as President of Hungary will be Speaker of Parliament Nagy (Communist Party).</p>
<h3>Poland Protests Again to the United States Against the Division of Germany</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 29th] Polish Ambassador to the United States Winiewicz today protested again to Marshall, harshly opposing the "unilateral German resolution in London." The article stated that the resolution in London hinders the solution of the German issue in accordance with the Potsdam Agreement and is in conflict with the previous statement by the United States that Germany should not be divided. The peace treaty with Germany cannot be influenced by the unilateral resolution of the United States within the European Recovery Program, Germany should be democratized, its heavy industry should be controlled, and the four powers should guarantee that Germany will not restore its hegemony in Europe.</p>
<h3>Rumors of Marshall's Trip to Europe, US Officials Deny</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper] San Francisco, 30th Broadcast: The US State Department today denied the rumors that the Marshall Plan would travel to Europe for an inspection trip. The spokesperson said, "Except for Paris, where the United Nations General Assembly will be held in September, Secretary Marshall has no plans to visit other places in Europe." According to rumors revealed a few days ago, Truman has approved Marshall's trip to Europe and agreed to use the White House No. 1 aircraft "Sacred Cow".</p>
<h3>US Loan to Iran to Purchase Weapons</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 29th] The United States has recently loaned US$26 million to Iran to enable it to re-equip its army and police. According to the State Department, Iran will only obtain light weapons, such as fighters and light tanks, and will not be able to obtain heavy weapons sufficient to take offensive actions abroad. The State Department also stated that the acquisition of equipment by the Iranian army is of concern to the United States, because the US government hopes that the Middle East can maintain international security. Iran is located south of the Soviet Union and has been under constant pressure from the Soviet Union.</p>
<h3>The Soviets Are Building Defenses on the Alaskan Shore, National Youth Undergoing Semi-Military Training</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 29th] United Press learned on the 29th that US Department of Defense officials have obtained existing and conclusive evidence that the Soviet Union is rushing to build large-scale defensive fortifications in Siberia, across from Alaska, including airports that can accommodate giant bombers. It is generally believed that this is one of the reasons why the Canadian Air Force did not go to the United Kingdom to participate in "exercises." Military experts believe that Canada needs every one of its planes to protect its so-called "Alaska Corridor".</p>
<h3>Three Auxiliary Organizations Cultivate Military Talents</h3>
<p>[United Press, London, 29th] Soviet officials have recently revealed a plan to systematically train Soviet youth to receive semi-military education. This education is undertaken by three volunteer groups that assist the army, navy, and air force. The foundation of these three groups was announced in a public statement on May 28th. Since then, these three groups have begun their work and recruited members. These three groups are under the leadership of military leaders and are assisted by the Communist Youth League and the Soviet Chamber of Commerce.</p>
<p>Dosav - Volunteer Organization to Assist the Air Force. The director is General Gamanin, who is responsible for "promoting group aviation sports". Aviation clubs and glider and paratrooper clubs are established in major industrial centers and important areas. General Gamanin said that he will organize competitions in various aviation technologies, and he plans to award medals and awards to those with outstanding achievements. The country's goal is to develop the Soviet aviation industry.</p>
<p>Dosarm - The volunteer organization to assist the army has also announced an ambitious plan. Various clubs will be established in industrial areas, collective farms, and state farms. The leading figure is General Kochanishev, whose mission is "to ensure that members of the association have not only basic tactical knowledge before enlisting, but also the skills to connect communications and drive motorcycles. A rifle club should be generally established everywhere.</p>
<p>Dosrlot - The group led by Admiral Nikolayev has not revealed as much about its future activities as the previous ones. Nikolayev said that the actual work of the group is to organize water sports and naval competitions.</p>

<p>[United Press International, Washington, 29th] Sources in communication today announced that at a meeting convened by Under Secretary of the Army Draper, it was decided to allocate 75 million yuan for the rehabilitation of Japan in the 1949 fiscal year, and another 22 million yuan for Korea. They stated that, in addition, Draper had decided to allocate 387 million yuan to Japan and 100 million yuan to Korea for food and fertilizer expenses.

<p>Socialist Party Submits Amendment Requests</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Tokyo, 30th] The draft ordinance to abolish the right of Japanese civil servants to strike and engage in collective bargaining was passed by the Japanese Cabinet and promulgated by the Japanese government today.

<p>[United Press International, Tokyo, 30th] The Socialist Party has submitted three points of amendment to the government regarding the civil service law: (1) the government ordinance should include a provision recognizing the right of civil servants to organize trade unions; (2) the government should, in any manner, recognize the right of civil servants to collective bargaining; (3) the government should make every effort to increase the wages of civil servants.</p>
<p>[United Press International, Tokyo, 30th] Forty thousand Japanese government telecommunications workers declared on the 30th that they would go on strike if the government adopts MacArthur's proposals for labor law reform. The Central Struggle Committee of Telecommunications Workers, controlled by the Communist Party, issued a statement calling on 400,000 workers to resist MacArthur's order prohibiting strikes, but the committee focused its attacks solely on the government and did not dare offend MacArthur.</p>
<h3>New Medical Device Invented in the U.S. to Visualize Internal Organs: Can Diagnose Diseases and Examine the Brain</h3>
<p>[United States Information Service, Washington, 29th] A new type of medical device has recently been invented in the United States that allows doctors to "see through" the human body to diagnose diseases. Surgical "explorations" can be largely avoided. Improved X-ray machines and highly sensitive electrical devices can clearly visualize internal organs and quickly examine brain diseases. This improved X-ray was invented by Dr. Gothmann of the Westinghouse Electric Corporation and can project images of internal organs onto a fluorescent screen with an intensity 500 times greater than that of ordinary X-rays. "Objects" as small as a few thousandths of an inch in area can be clearly identified. Another device for treating brain diseases is the result of ten years of research by Dr. Gant of Johns Hopkins University. This device can detect cerebral edema in half an hour.</p>

<p>[United Press International, Washington, 30th] President Truman and his economic advisors warned Congress today that an economic panic may be in the offing unless some measures are taken to curb inflation. Prices, wages, production, and profits are all at peak levels, the President said. This may be the calm before a great storm unless the government takes "drastic measures" to shorten the unstable period between post-war boom and economic stability.</p>

<h3>Police Strictly Prevent Goods Flowing into Communist Areas: Blocking the River and Sea Ports of Zhenjiang, Designating Six Passages, and Setting Up Sentries to Inspect Vessels in the Pacification Zone</h3>
<p>In order to thoroughly prevent materials from this city from flowing into Communist areas and to prevent spies from the bandit areas from coming to Shanghai for activities, the Shanghai Garrison Headquarters has specifically planned to implement a blockade along the river and sea ports within the garrison district, and along the waterways between Chongming Island and Yushan, absolutely prohibiting vessels from passing through. This decision has been submitted to Commander Xuan for approval and will be implemented starting August 1st. However, in order to take into account the convenience of ordinary and legitimate merchants entering and exiting, six ports have been designated as specially approved passages. These six specially approved passage ports are as follows: (1) Wusong Port in Shanghai City, (2) Sanyiugang in Chuansha County, (3) Qiyakou in Taicang County, (4) Wangang on the north shore of Chongming County, (5) Nanbao Town on the south shore of Chongming County, (6) Nanmengang on the south shore of Chongming County. However, vessels traveling to and from these six places will still be strictly inspected. In order to carry out the inspection task, the Garrison Headquarters has decided to set up inspection posts at these six ports to specialize in inspection duties. The main points of the inspection are as follows: (1) All vessels coming from the Pacification Zone must undergo strict inspection by the inspection posts. (2) Vessels coming from the Pacification Zone should have proof from the local government. (3) All vessels exporting from the Garrison Headquarters' jurisdiction to the Pacification Zone, after passing strict inspection, should have a certificate of inspection from the local authorities at the destination, which must be submitted to the Garrison Headquarters for review upon returning to Shanghai. Detailed measures will be officially announced in the coming days.</p>

<h3>Sale of Nylon Stockings Prohibited Starting Tomorrow: Many Companies Waiting, One Customer Hesitates</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] Nylon stockings are one of the decorative items for modern women and were once very popular. Currently, the price of a pair of stockings has reached 27 million legal tender.

It has been decided to prohibit sales starting August 1st. The deadline has now arrived, and today is the last day. Starting tomorrow, the Social Affairs Bureau, together with the Police Bureau, will begin inspections. If it is discovered that there are still unauthorized sales, they will be confiscated.</p>
<p>Generally, people believe that after these last two days, nylon stockings will disappear from the market, so many people went to various companies to purchase them yesterday, and many of the buyers were men. According to previous investigations, the total number of these stockings stored at Shengbingji ranked first among all stores in the city, so there were many more people who went to that store to buy them. Yesterday afternoon, this reporter witnessed the booming sales situation at that store on North Sichuan Road. At that time, a middle-aged man was selecting a pair, complaining that it was too big or too small, and could not decide for a long time, and the shop assistant was quite impatient.

According to passengers on the same ship, the woman seemed to be mentally ill, and her emotions were erratic on the ship. She spoke to herself, sometimes singing loudly, sometimes crying uncontrollably, which was often disliked by passengers on the same ship. It is presumed that due to various stimuli, she developed suicidal thoughts.

<h3>Melting and Selling Gold Bars Case: Hu Xinyi Indicted, Special Criminal Court Believes There is Sufficient Evidence</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The major case of "Gold Note King" Hu Xinyi melting old gold bars, after being investigated by the police and transferred to the Special Criminal Court for interrogation for several days, has now been prosecuted. According to the statement of reasons, the case originated from a confidential report received by the Shanghai Municipal Police Bureau. The report stated that the premises at 331 Jiangxi Road was formerly the Jitai Money Exchange, which operated foreign exchange. After the authorities banned its operation, the shop was locked up and labeled with the words "Jichang Yarn Shop" and "Jitai He Tobacco Company" preparatory office, managed by Hu Xinyi. In reality, it was operating a black market for gold, being one of the largest in the city, and so on. After the investigation, a letter was sent to the court. According to the confession of the defendant Hu Xinyi, although he did not admit to buying or selling gold, the police sent personnel to monitor the Jichang shop's telephone. The result confirmed that it was engaged in gold trading. During the search, there were as many as thirty-seven customers in the shop, and gold bar transaction bills, gold IOUs, and suspicious bills were found in the secret room upstairs. Upon reviewing the bills, the words "Asia," "Big," several pieces, several units, several taels, several qian, and in the second bill, two bracelets, two taels, four qian, one fen, and five li, and the suspicious bills containing "Li Out," "Wang In," paying several hundred million, receiving several hundred million, etc., clearly indicate gold transactions. Furthermore, the shop installed up to seven unauthorized intercom telephones, which are sufficient evidence for communication tools for gold trading, leaving no room for denial.</p>
<h3>Listening to the Verdict, Returned to Custody, Briefly Loosened Handcuffs: Notorious Bandit Little White Dragon Escapes</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Yesterday afternoon at 4:30 PM, the Shanghai Local Court suddenly experienced the escape of the notorious bandit Little White Dragon. Despite the efforts of the bailiffs to investigate and apprehend him, he has not yet been caught. It is reported that the robber Zhu Yongfu, also known as Wu Tianxiang (nickname Little White Dragon), on June 18th of this year at midnight, robbed the citizen Lu Shaotang of a gold ring in the Yongqing Lane of Shanhai Pass Road. Afterwards, he was captured by the police, and two revolvers and six bullets were seized. He was transferred to the local inspection office and then to the local court for trial. Yesterday afternoon around 4:00 PM, in the local court, Judge Fang Xianghai pronounced the verdict: Zhu Yongfu and Wu Tianxiang were both sentenced to seven years of imprisonment and seven years of deprivation of civil rights. The pistols and bullets were confiscated, and the gold ring was returned to the victim. After the verdict, the bailiffs returned the two criminals to custody. At that time, all the criminal courts in the local court were in session, and the bailiffs were short-handed. Together with eighteen other defendants, they were escorted by only two bailiffs. Because there were only eight pairs of handcuffs left, each pair of criminals was handcuffed together, forming eight groups in total. The remaining two female criminals were not handcuffed. When the bailiff Yang Lisan handcuffed the bandit Wu, the criminal falsely claimed that his hand hurt, requesting a looser restraint. Yang did not notice at the time and did not handcuff him tightly. When descending the stairs, Yang was in the front, and another bailiff escorted the female criminals at the rear. One of the female criminals had a leg ailment and walked slowly, causing the line of prisoners to be interrupted. Little White Dragon took this opportunity to quietly remove his handcuffs, blended out the gate, and left. When the bailiffs arrived at the detention room for roll call, they discovered that Little White Dragon was missing. They closed the iron gate and conducted a thorough search, checking identification cards for everyone entering and exiting. By 6:00 PM, the entire court was still under tense alert, but he had not yet been found.</p>

<h3>Methods to Rescue Public Utilities: Majority Approved by President Weng, Zhao Avoiding the Head, Now Negotiating Loans with the National Bank</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Zhao Zengjue, Director of the Municipal Public Utilities Bureau, went to Beijing a few days ago to request loans for public utilities and to stabilize fuel prices for public utilities from the Executive Yuan.

President Weng instructed: (1) The government should absolutely maintain the cost of public utility companies. (2) The fuel price required for public utilities should not be changed within one month, and the fuel management agency should discuss technical issues. (3) The loan portion can be discussed with the National Bank.

<h3>Having Suffered Greatly, Love Finally Becomes a Family: Suzhou Double Suicide Attempt, Parents Forgive and Settle the Lawsuit</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The lovers Shen Wei (female) and Huang Xi had a close relationship in normal times. In May of this year, they traveled to Suzhou together and indulged in love in a private room. On June 29th, they traveled to Suzhou again.

<h3>Distribution Ratio of Fishery Relief Materials Agreed Upon, Two-Thirds of Timber Sold to the Ministry of Communications</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The meeting on the distribution of fishery relief materials for seven coastal provinces and four cities concluded as scheduled yesterday after three days of discussion, with representatives from various regions arguing for their own interests. The focus of the dispute during the meeting was, firstly, the percentage of material distribution. Representatives from each region hoped to obtain a larger distribution figure. Secondly, the issue of selling the timber portion of the materials to the Ministry of Communications. Representatives from Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces opposed the sale to the Ministry of Communications, while those from other regions who supported it had different opinions on the price and quantity. After heated discussions on these two issues, it was decided that the distribution ratio would be as follows: Guangdong would receive 25%, Zhejiang would receive 20%, Fujian would receive 12%, Taiwan would receive 10%, Jiangsu would receive 11%, Hebei would receive 11%, and Shandong would receive 11%. As for the timber portion, it was decided that two-thirds would be sold to the Ministry of Communications at a price of US$1.25 per foot, converted to national currency at the actual price. The proceeds would also be distributed according to the above ratio. Each region should organize a regional fishery material processing committee within one month by the relevant agencies in each region to handle these relief materials. A regional material distribution meeting should be convened, limited to one year to complete the handling. If there are special reasons, an extension of six months can be requested. If it still cannot be completed after the deadline, the disaster relief committee will take it back for further processing. The allocated fishery relief materials include fishing gear, engines, shipbuilding hand tools, hardware, boat mooring equipment, navigation instruments, paint, net accessories, rigging, coir rope, steel cable, timber, etc., with an estimated total value of about five to six million US dollars.</p>

The Social Bureau deeply commended them for their enthusiastic contributions.</p>
<h3>Evicting Tenants, Assembling a Crowd to Commit Assault: Ophthalmologist Has Foot Broken and is Severely Injured</h3>
<p>Zhang Xijun, director of the second branch of Guanghua Eye Hospital at 808 Jiangning Road, a famous ophthalmologist, was seriously injured around 11:00 PM on the 29th when the landlord Wang Weide led four or five thugs and broke into his bedroom while he was sleeping to assault him, resulting in a broken ankle. This created an unprecedented incident of a landlord injuring a tenant in the city. It is reported that Zhang rented two houses at that address in 1937 to open a hospital. Recently, the landlord Wang Weide repeatedly forced him to move out. Zhang, because of the severe housing shortage in Shanghai, had nowhere to move, so he repeatedly invited neighbors to mediate. Unexpectedly, the landlord resorted to force. At about 10:00 PM the night before last, while Zhang was alone in the bedroom, Wang Weide led four or five thugs into the room and assaulted Zhang. Zhang cried for help but found no way to escape. He fled wounded to the balcony along the road. Wang and the thugs also rushed to the balcony, wielding wooden sticks and chair legs, and beat him severely, threatening to kill Zhang. In desperation, Zhang jumped off the balcony railing and fell onto the road, breaking both ankles and unable to move. At this time, a "906" pedicab came. Zhang asked the driver, surnamed Song, for help. Song hugged Zhang onto the pedicab and headed south, preparing to report the case to the Jiangning Road Police Station. Unexpectedly, Wang and the others caught up on the road, chased back the pedicab, and beat the already severely injured Zhang again, tearing the pedicab driver's clothes. Fortunately, nearby police officers arrived, and Zhang's life was saved, but both feet were broken, and the injuries were severe. After questioning by the Jiangning Road Police Station, the case will be transferred to the Local Inspectorate.</p>
<h3>Nine Hundred Pawnshops Face Collapse Crisis: Value of Pledged Items Soars, Market Interest Rates High, Difficult Capital Turnover Faces Serious Blow</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] In the recent months of sharp inflation, various legitimate industries have suffered greatly, and the pawnshop industry, which is closely related to the lives of the poor, is facing a collapse crisis due to heavy pressure. Following the closure of most pawnshops in Jiaxing, Changshu, and other places, the business of the 900 pawnshops in the city is also in a state of stagnation. This business, with a history of more than 2,000 years, which once maintained the stability of rural society through lending, is now desolate. On the dim, dark counter, the "shop assistant" is drowsy, and the scene is extremely bleak.</p>
<p>The biggest difficulties currently faced by the pawnshop industry are the rapid changes in the value of pledged items and the high black market interest rates. For example, at the beginning of last month, a pawnshop took in a coat. According to the current value of 70 to 80 million yuan, it should pay a pawn fee of 7 to 8 million yuan. However, when the pledger redeemed it at the beginning of this month, the current value of the coat had soared to 300 to 400 million yuan, so there was no need to redeem it. In the "ticket transfer" once, the pawnshop must deduct the original pawn fee and five-cent monthly interest, and then make up for the pledger about 30 million yuan. The so-called "ticket transfer" means that the pledger redeems the item according to the regulations, pays the original pawn fee and monthly interest, and then repawns it. However, in one turnaround, because the black market interest paid by the pawnshop is often higher than the interest it receives, each "transfer" means that the pawnshop suffers more losses and increases the difficulty of capital utilization.</p>
<p>While sitting and eating capital, waiting for bankruptcy, at the same time, because the price of clothing and other items is increasing day by day, the stalls around the pawnshop that specialize in buying pawn tickets are doing a thriving business. They buy pawn tickets from pledgers who are unable to redeem them, and then redeem them from the pawnshop for resale. Therefore, the "no goods" (pledged items that exceed the redemption deadline), which became the final source of funds for the pawnshop, disappeared invisibly. Before the war, "no goods" could account for 30% of the total number each month, but now it is almost zero, which is a fatal blow to the pawnshops.</p>
<p>Before the development of banking and securities businesses, the pawnshop industry had always been the safest and most reliable investment destination in the eyes of the public for decades. In recent months, the black market interest rate has been as high as 90 cents, while the deposit interest rate of the pawnshop industry is less than 30 cents. Therefore, funds are reluctant to move forward. The pawnshops, which are exhausted and in urgent need of turnover, have been hit by this blow, and they are even more at risk. At present, the pawnshops can only find ways to negotiate loans with relatives and friends to cope with the daily small transactions of less than several million yuan. Most of them are sitting and eating capital, waiting for bankruptcy. According to the industry statistics, before the war, the "family capital" (that is, the funds) of each pawnshop was usually around tens of thousands of yuan, and at least 40,000 yuan. Hefei Zhabei pawnshop giant Dingfeng Pawnshop had "family capital" of 120,000 yuan before the war, equivalent to more than 12 large gold bars at that time. In the past two years, it has suffered repeated losses and has been unable to recover. As of now, the calculated "family capital" is only more than 300 million yuan, equivalent to less than one tael of gold.</p>
<p>The National Bank Loan Has Not Been Realized The current stipulated 50 cents monthly interest of the pawnshop industry includes 4 cents for warehouse rent and 10 cents for handling fees. The actual interest is only 36 cents. Therefore, the era when the industry was regarded by citizens as a "black-hearted transaction" has long passed. It is reported that the authorities are also dissatisfied with this 36 cents monthly interest and have ordered it to be reduced to benefit the poor. They have also promised to provide loans from the National Bank to help the industry tide over the difficulties, but this matter has not yet been realized. The industry association said that in this situation of not knowing whether to laugh or cry, it will first apply to the authorities to slightly increase the interest rate according to the "shortage and dismantling" ratio of the silver and money industry, and then adjust it dynamically at any time, so that on the one hand, it can continue to barely maintain business, and on the other hand, it can slightly pull the capital, so that the foundation will not be broken beyond repair.</p>
<p>Labor and Management Alike Are Groaning In Pain Currently, 50% of the industry has posted red notices of "stopping pawn and waiting for redemption" at the door. "Stopping pawn and waiting for redemption" means closing the store for liquidation. Another 30% are already in the liquidation stage, but they are unwilling to publicly post announcements. It is said that this is to save the "face" of the decades-old store and to prevent depositors who supply funds from coming to demand debts upon hearing the news. There were nearly 3,000 employees in the industry in the city, including more than ten positions such as shop assistant, head counter, second counter, clothing and luggage room, and jewelry room, with clear divisions. In the past, they were well-paid and looked down on all industries. Especially the position of shop assistant was stern and cold in the eyes of the poor, and had unlimited power. Now, due to the exhaustion of business, layoffs are being implemented. Those who leave their jobs cannot change careers because all they have learned is specialized technology. The capital provider of the industry once lamented that before the war, one pawnshop was worth ten cigarette and paper shops. At present, ten pawnshops are not as well-stocked and prosperous as one cigarette and paper shop. The labor side of the industry sighed: Before the war, we were the saviors, even the "gods of wealth," in the eyes of the poor, but now the monthly salary is less than 10 million, not even as good as a pedicab driver! The changes in the world are reminiscent of the luxury and prosperity of the pawnshop industry around 1934, and the feelings of the past and present are overwhelming.</p>

<h3>Hunan Province, Wugang·Xinning: Grain Shortage Leads to Bloody Incident, County Magistrate Shoots Starving People, Township Head Assaults Town Head, Both Places Enter Strike</h3>
<p>[Our Changsha dispatch of the 28th] Due to the severe famine in Xinning, several hundred starving people went to the county government on the evening of the 26th to petition for relief, leading to disturbances. The county magistrate ordered the opening of fire, resulting in a tragic incident, with six people injured, four of whom are critically wounded. The entire county's industry and commerce are now on strike, and the Party, the Senate, and various sectors have telegraphed the provincial government and the provincial assembly, requesting a thorough investigation.</p>
<p>[Another dispatch] Wugang has recently experienced a rice shortage, causing widespread panic. A few days ago, in the evening, dozens of rice merchants were carrying rice through the East Gate's Jade Coin Bridge when they were stopped by starving people. The town office, upon hearing the news, sent police to suppress the situation. Amidst the disturbances, Liu, the township head of Shuanglong Township, also arrived with several armed soldiers, claiming that the rice was purchased by his township. Mistaking the town police for those obstructing the rice, he detained them and sent them to the county government for detention. The next morning, Luo, the town head of the town office, went to the county government to inquire. Liu, the township head, was present, and the two sides disagreed. Liu then used his cane to beat Luo. After the incident, the townspeople, upon hearing the news, felt indignant and gathered to petition the county government to punish the perpetrator and investigate Liu's whereabouts. Liu, sensing danger, took refuge in the Self-Defense Force headquarters, which was then surrounded by the crowd. Liu hid on the second floor and, taking advantage of his elevated position, ordered his guards to open fire, killing one person and seriously injuring another. As the situation escalated, the petitioning crowd demanded that the county magistrate arrest and punish the murderer. County Magistrate Chang detained Liu in the county government but made no statement on how he would be punished. The crowd, believing that the county magistrate was intentionally protecting him, became agitated again and stormed into the county government. The guards, unable to stop them, opened fire, killing another person. Wugang is now in a state of strike. The county government is under temporary martial law, with machine guns set up in front of the office, as if facing a major enemy, and the situation has not eased.</p>

<h3>Desolate Scenes in Changli, Most Shops Closed, Transactions in Silver Dollars, Han Wenzheng's Shrine Rented to Poor Tenants</h3>
<p>[Our Qinhuangdao dispatch of the 30th] This reporter recently visited Changli, Hebei, a model county in eastern Hebei known for its rich cultural relics. Although it has been recovered for a month, entry and exit inspections are extremely strict. There are few pedestrians in the city, and most shops are closed. The county government is operating in a dilapidated official residence. The provincial women's normal school and the county high school have both suffered disasters. Several elementary schools have had much of their equipment destroyed by artillery fire. Elementary and middle school students who are unable to return home are attending summer training classes. The only problem for the autumn semester is repairing school buildings and making desks and chairs. The local armed forces are repairing the city walls and fortifications. The mountainous areas a dozen miles away are mostly occupied by bandits, making the situation quite complex. Currently, the shops and melon markets between the South Gate and the railway station are doing brisk business, but most prices are negotiated in silver dollars. Changli was a major economic pillar of eastern Hebei in the past, as many wealthy merchants operated large businesses in the Northeast. However, most of them have now gone bankrupt. The coastal fishing areas are also in the hands of bandits, making Changli even poorer. Han Wenzheng's public shrine has also been rented to poor tenants, creating a desolate scene. The only sign of prosperity is the abundance of melons and fruits, which are cheap and of good quality.</p>

<h3>Severe Floods in Xiangbin Lake, Hundreds of Miles of Land Inundated in Changde·Hanshou Area, Representatives of Affected Counties Petition Provincial Government</h3>
<p>[Our Changsha Dispatch, 29th] The secondary flood in Xiangbin Lake has been devastating. According to Mr. Tao, Director of the Dongting Reclamation Bureau of the Ministry of National Defense, who witnessed the disaster, for hundreds of miles from Changde to Hanshou, not a single piece of land can be seen. It's as if one is in the middle of the ocean. The largest Ren'an Embankment in Hanshou has collapsed on both ends. He saw more than twenty families of flood victims in the Black Mountain Temple, all living in water towers, looking emaciated and miserable. When asked why they didn't seek refuge elsewhere, they replied that they didn't have the strength to escape and couldn't bear to abandon their meager belongings, willing to live and die with their homes. From Yuanjiang to Caowei, there is a large embankment, only two inches above the water. All the farmers, men, women, and children, are guarding the dike day and night, not resting for a moment. Yuanjiang City is submerged more than ten feet deep. Not a single intact house can be seen in Caowei, only the rooftops and willow branches. Inside the non-breached dikes, farmers are rescuing half-soaked and half-cooked new grains in the floodwaters. The water level in Nanxian County is more than two feet higher than in the 34th year of the Republic. Twenty dikes have collapsed, and the houses, tools, and livestock of the disaster victims have all been lost to the waves. In Chenxiang and Yin City, boats are sailing on land, and all commercial activity has stopped. Driven by poverty, many people have committed suicide by hanging themselves.

<h3>Merchants Participating in Trade with Japan Must Follow Prescribed Procedures</h3>
<p>[Our dispatch] Merchants engaging in trade with Japan must not engage in commercial activities without special government permission. Japan is still under Allied control, and the exchange rate is not yet fixed, making the situation special. Therefore, the government specifically formulated and promulgated the "Essential Points for Merchants' Trade with Japan" last year, so that our merchants can conduct limited barter trade with Japan under the overall planning of the government. To date, many merchants have participated, but there is a lack of clarity about the procedures. Inquiries with relevant authorities yielded the following answers:</p>
<p>(A) Cash Trade: Any merchant who intends to export domestic products to Japan, except for the goods listed in Annex (5) of the current import and export trade regulations and the goods prohibited for export by the Export Control Commission's public notice, may export them to Japan according to the general export regulations, provided that they can sell the foreign exchange from the export to a designated bank. However, the import of goods from Japan to China is generally prohibited, except for barter trade.</p>
<p>(B) Barter Trade: (1) Any merchant who wants to participate in barter trade with Japan should first apply to the local Chamber of Commerce and be recommended by the Chamber of Commerce to the Trade Guidance Committee for Trade with Japan of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce. The committee will review the applicant's qualifications. Then, the merchant will formulate a trade plan based on the "Range of Import and Export Goods for Trade with Japan in 1948" approved by the Executive Yuan and submit it to the Guidance Committee for approval. Then, the Ministry of Industry and Commerce will send a letter to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to issue a passport to Japan. (2) The purchase and sale contract negotiated between the merchant and the Japanese side should be sent to the commercial commissioner of our mission in Japan to be negotiated with the organization representing the Japanese side. Three copies should be prepared separately and sent by the commercial commissioner to the China Trust Bureau, the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, and the Export Control Commission. (3) When the merchant performs the purchase and sale contract, he should apply to the commercial commissioner of our mission in Japan for a certificate of import and export goods. The merchant will then use the original to apply to the Export Promotion Office of the Export Control Commission or its district office for an import and export license. (4) Any qualified merchant who intends to export goods from our country to Japan must first fill out five copies of the "Certificate of Purchase and Sale of Export or Re-export Foreign Exchange to Designated Bank" and the certificate of export goods issued by the above-mentioned commercial commissioner, and submit them to the Export Promotion Office of the Export Control Commission or its district office for verification and stamping, and affix the stamp of barter trade with Japan and customs clearance. The merchant will then report to customs for inspection and release. At the same time, the merchant must send the following documents to the China Trust Bureau with a letter for registration of the export price. 1. Pricing and transaction documents (listing the name, quantity, unit price, and total price of the goods exported to Japan) 2. A copy of the customs declaration, invoice, insurance policy, and bill of lading. (All bills of lading should specify that the China Trust Bureau should forward them to the consignee). (5) Any qualified merchant who intends to import goods from Japan to China, or when the Japanese side delivers the goods, should also send the following documents to the commercial commissioner of our mission in Japan for verification and issuance of an import certificate. 1. Pricing and transaction documents (listing the name, quantity, unit price, and total price of the goods imported into China). 2. A certificate from the China Trust Bureau stating the amount of the merchant's account balance or a letter proving that the merchant's guarantee has been received.</p>
<p>The merchant should also fill out seven copies of the "Application for a License" and submit them along with the import certificate issued by the above-mentioned commercial commissioner and relevant documents to the person in charge of the Export Promotion Office of the Export Control Commission for signing or to the district office of the commission for verification and stamping, and affix the stamp of barter trade with Japan before handing them over to the merchant for customs declaration and release.</p>
<h3>External Stimulation Intensifies, Chinese Stocks Stir Buying Sentiment</h3>
<p>Chinese stocks were strongly stimulated yesterday by external factors, and credit was so abundant that buying sentiment was stirred reluctantly. However, both industry insiders and outsiders engaged in arbitrage, moving east to compensate for the west, and the buying appetite of the Guangdong faction was only described as steady.</p>
<p>The opening in the morning was mediocre. Yongsha debuted at a low price of 11,400 yuan. Numbers 3 and 135 were sold to 11,380 yuan, and Numbers 76 and 226 immediately entered, rising to 12,250 yuan. Numbers 107 and 145 were sold, retreating to 12,050 yuan. After that, market sentiment was still good, but small stocks and miscellaneous stocks were abnormally weak, and the situation was uncertain. Finally, the yarn and cloth industries rose again, and credit became so abundant that it could not be increased. Numbers 83 and 135 rose to a high price of 12,700 yuan, and Liandi, Rongfeng, and Hengfeng announced that they would stop rising. Numbers 137 and 173 rose and then fell, and Numbers 216, 172, and 207 were sold, closing at 12,550 yuan at noon. Compared with the previous close, in addition to the rise of Liandi, Rongfeng, and Hengfeng, Yongsha, Xinguang, Meilin, Xinhe, Huayan, Qinyu, Xinhua, Business Unity, Jinglun, Matches, and China Silk rose by half a percentage point. Jingfu National Goods, Meiya, Lianan, Zhabei, and Yonggong Underwear rose by one percentage point. Huaxin and China Cement were flat, and the rest rose slightly.</p>
<p>The afternoon market continued the momentum of the morning market. Yongsha exceeded the daily limit as soon as the market opened, rising by a maximum of 450. Numbers 69 and 151 all closed, but retreated to 12,600 yuan. It was initially rumored that there was a difference in the exchange rate, and it exceeded the limit many times. Finally, the state bank advanced a little, and although the rise from outside the industry was strong, the market closed with Numbers 205 and 145 selling to 12,600 yuan. Meiya and others stopped rising, and all reported a small decline. It was rumored that the President was coming to Shanghai, and the market sentiment suddenly weakened. Compared with the morning close, in addition to Meilin, Rongfeng, and Liandi's rise limit, Yongsha, Meiya, Xinhe, and Yonggong rose and then fell after the rise limit. Gain and loss were both seen in the exchange. Hengfeng fell by one percentage point, Jinglun by a small percentage point, Huafeng, Lianan, and Matches were still flat, and the rest of the stocks rose and fell slightly. In the off-market, unlisted stocks saw a half-percentage-point increase in public utility stocks and China Wuzhou, while the rest were stable.</p>
<p>Government Bonds</p>
<p>More than 2 million was traded yesterday. Liubing opened in the morning at 920,000, rose from 910,000, and closed at 1.03 million. Compared with the previous close, A and B rose by 100,000 yuan, C rose by 130,000 yuan, D rose by 110,000 yuan, and E rose by 120,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>Import Licenses</h3>
<p>Starting in August, the National Bank Will Handle the Issuance, and Collect a Handling Fee of 0.1%</p>
<p>Regarding import licenses, the Export Control Commission previously set up a visa office to handle it. Currently, the visa office has been abolished, and the import licenses issued by the Export Control Commission will be signed by the director of the committee. A visa office will be established to handle the matter. The issuing matters have been submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval to entrust the Central Bank to handle them, which will be implemented starting on August 1. All import licenses will be signed by the director of the visa office from the same date, and it has been approved that a handling fee of 0.1% will be charged separately, except for special regulations. In the future, for goods approved for import by the Export Control Commission, a handling fee must be paid to the Central Bank before the visa can be issued for exchange settlement and import.</p>
<h3>Price Index Savings</h3>

<p>It is learned that in order to resolve the current economic crisis, the government is planning price index savings to absorb legal tender and maintain the people's purchasing power. The Central Bank is discussing this plan with the Ministry of Finance. The Ministry of Finance believes that there are too many technical problems, so the realization of this matter may be delayed. Price index savings mean that people deposit legal tender based on the price index on the date of deposit, and when they withdraw the money, it is calculated based on the price index on the date of withdrawal, so as to avoid losses due to currency depreciation due to rising prices. After implementation, the amount of goods that savers can purchase when they recover their savings in the future will be the same as when they deposited legal tender. Because savings are based on the price index, everyone's surplus funds no longer need to be used to hoard materials or purchase gold, as is the case today, which can stabilize prices. In the current situation, this is the only way to contract the currency and maintain purchasing power, which has attracted attention from all parties, and everyone hopes to see it implemented soon.</p>
<h3>Exchange Rate for Publicly Operated Enterprises Calculated at 60%</h3>
<p>[Our dispatch] The Operations Bureau of the National Bank recently issued a notice to all branches that in the future, the exchange rate for remittances from state-run and public-run enterprises and institutions will be handled in accordance with the industry standard, and a 60% fee will be charged.</p>
<h3>Method for Paying Principal and Interest on Short-Term Treasury Bills Due Today Determined</h3>
<p>The China and Jiaotong Banks, which sold 37-year short-term treasury bills on the securities exchange market, convened a meeting yesterday by the National Treasury Bureau of the Central Bank with the organizers of the China and Jiaotong Banks to discuss the payment of principal and interest on treasury bills due on July 31. Those sold by the banks themselves will be redeemed by the banks. Those who hold treasury bills with the hard seal of the China or Jiaotong Banks should go directly to the banks to redeem them. If there are no treasury bills with the hard seal of the China or Jiaotong Banks, they can be redeemed at the National Treasury Bureau of the Central Bank. Those who subscribed at the Hongkou Branch of the National Treasury Bureau should also go to the branch for redemption.</p>
<h3>Rare Tea Exports</h3>
<p>The export of green tea, such as Zhenmei, which mainly sells well in Africa, is currently being inquired about by customers in that region, but the prices offered are still quite harsh. However, tea merchants here feel that the production price is rising repeatedly, and various domestic teas have recently seen good sales in the street and rural areas, and buyers are willing to search for them at good prices, which has frequently stimulated the market, so it is not easy to cope with overseas inquiries for a while, and they have temporarily adopted a wait-and-see attitude. Therefore, the foreign tea market is still unusually deserted, and the situation is firm in the quiet.</p>
<h3>Silver Market Loosens, Confidence Rises: Cotton Yarn and Cloth Prices Increase Across the Board</h3>
<p>Yesterday's cotton yarn market saw the money supply further ease and cotton cloth prices sharply rise. Moreover, with the partial opening of self-provided foreign exchange, the Hong Kong exchange rate continuously decreased, leading to an increase in Hong Kong yarn prices. Merchants from Tianjin, Guangdong, and other regions continuously sought to purchase, boosting market confidence significantly.</p>
<p>Forty-two count Blue Phoenix fine yarn immediately surged by 100 million upon opening. Market sentiment was strengthened by higher asking prices, creating a sharp increase in activity. Although Shenxin and Wing On factories opened for business, market prices continued to rise aggressively, ending the day at 2.16 billion, a sharp increase of 310 million from the previous day. Tomorrow's selling price is expected to rise to 2.2 billion, another increase of 320 million from the previous day. Twenty-one count Double Horse also rose by 270 million. Other counts of coarse and fine yarn also rose uniformly by about 100 to 200 million.</p>
<p>Yesterday's cotton cloth market saw prices rise due to an insufficient supply of raw cotton and reports of factories reducing production. Dyeing factories expected that the end-of-month index might increase by 20-30%. Amidst rumors of easy money, market confidence began to tighten. Twelve-pound Dragon Head fine cloth, due to many periods without sales from the Spinning and Weaving Company, faced a dry market inventory. Various parties aggressively sought to purchase, and prices jumped by 400,000 upon opening. Subsequently, with frantic purchasing from Northern merchants and dyeing factories, prices rose directly to 57 million at closing, a further sharp increase of 3.4 million from the previous day, showing signs that supply was still insufficient to meet demand. Consequently, prices in the after-hours market rose to 58-59 million, with orders still being placed. Other drills, coarse cloth, bleached cloth, and various colored cloths and shirting fabrics all increased sharply again.</p>
<p>Another report: The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Haiti vessel exported this morning, carrying 1,500 tons of yarn and cloth to Hong Kong, over 300 tons to Shougu, over 300 tons of general merchandise to Singapore and Yangon, and 1,700 pieces of fresh goods to Hong Kong.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Previously, the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, concerned that the dumping of Japanese cloth in Southeast Asia was severely impacting the export of domestic products, telegraphed the Yarn Control Committee to formulate countermeasures. It has now been learned that the committee has drafted a proposal and submitted it to the ministry for approval. The proposal plans to purchase 450,000 bales of Indian cotton and 150,000 bales of American cotton within the 37th fiscal year, with 20% of the finished products being exported to counter the dumping of Japanese goods. Furthermore, the Yarn Control Committee and the Export Committee will jointly form a Southeast Asia inspection team with national and private manufacturers, with the aim of actively promoting exports as a countermeasure against the dumping of Japanese yarn and cloth.</p>
<h3>Silk Industry Established, Silk Market Opens</h3>
<p>The silk industry, in order to meet needs, yesterday began the establishment of a silk market for the trading of silk fabrics. The police have dispatched personnel to monitor transactions in order to prevent unscrupulous merchants from taking the opportunity to engage in other illegal transactions and price gouging.</p>
<h3>Woolen Fabric Prices Remain Firm</h3>
<p>Woolen fabrics, due to various facts and environmental factors, have standard prices that are consistently difficult to lower. At most, there are only temporary periods of sharp increases followed by small corrections. The circulation of goods in the market is less than during periods of stable prices. Yesterday, there were few formal transactions in woolen fabrics, and prices were firm, with actual sales declining. Small-factory products and large-factory-finished miscellaneous woolen fabrics are still sold on the tea party market, as their prices are cheaper and highly suitable for consumers in various regions.</p>
<h3>Bank Clearinghouse Transfers Worsen</h3>
<p>Yesterday's bill exchange at the four banks, two bureaus, and one treasury totaled 114.8 billion yuan.

<h3>Rice Prices Firm as Harvest Approaches: New Pudong Rice Transactions Gradually Increase</h3>
<p>The rice market initially fell and then rose, ultimately showing a slight increase. Early trading saw a decline of 2 million yuan due to sluggish outbound transportation, causing the price drop. However, the price decrease in mid-market trading stimulated demand, resulting in a slight rebound. Northern market white geng rice was priced at 37 million yuan, and high-quality geng rice was priced at 39 million yuan. Southern market thin rice was priced at 38 million yuan. Transactions in new Pudong rice gradually increased, with prices ranging from 35 million to 37 million yuan across three grades.

Old-brand flour rose from 12 million to 12.6 million yuan, slightly up by 200,000 yuan from the previous day. Battleship brand flour closed at 11.65 million yuan, and the market showed signs of stabilization. Red Bee, Jiancheng, and miscellaneous brands of flour showed slight weakness, while bran increased by 200,000-300,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Miscellaneous Grains showed mixed trends. Soybeans increased by 1 million yuan due to limited inventory and active purchasing from merchants. Broad beans experienced sluggish sales, and there were few transactions for Gou rice and green beans, with little price fluctuation in the market. Yuan wheat and red sorghum each added 500,000 yuan, weakening at the close. Sesame seeds and raw kernels, under the purchasing activity of merchants, each rose by 2-3 million yuan.</p>
<p>Edible Oils gradually increased. With soybean prices rising, sellers maintained prices, and factories also insisted on higher prices. Moreover, the return of warehouse receipts was also scarce, leading to higher prices. Soybean oil initially opened at 79 million yuan, gradually rising to 81 million yuan at the close, up by 4 million yuan from the previous day. Rapeseed oil also rose by 4 million yuan, crude oil rose by 7 million yuan, a Ji barrel of crude oil was traded for 107 million yuan, and a small cart of sesame oil broke the 100 million mark, a sharp increase of 10 million yuan.

<h3>British Standard Young Athlete John Mark Runs the Last Leg of the Torch Relay</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, London, 29th] The "mysterious person" who carried the torch into Wembley Stadium and lit the flame during the final leg of the World Games torch relay was John Mark, a 22-year-old medical student at St. Mary's Hospital in Paddington, standing at six feet two inches tall, and a handsome young man. He was selected by the World Games Executive Committee as the representative of British youth athletes. This matter was kept secret until Mark appeared at Wembley Stadium.

<p>[Central News Agency, London, 29th] Today was one of the hottest days in London in seventeen years.

The 72 British runners responsible for completing the final journey of the torch relay received great attention from the British people. Spectators stood by the roadside all night, causing traffic jams, and some followed the relay team by car and bicycle, causing the police to have to clear the road for the torchbearers. The roadside audience included people of all ages and nationalities, and some were wearing pajamas, young people wearing bathrobes, and old women in wheelchairs being pushed two miles to watch the torch relay. Last night, when the British Navy destroyer HMS Bicester (which carried the torch across the English Channel) handed the torch to the first British relay runner in Dover, 50,000 people attended the ceremony.

<p>School Introduction</p>
<h3>Peiping Railway College</h3>
<p>— Zheng</p>
<p>As you walk past the southern entrance of Fuyou Street, or past Li Gelao Hutong, you will find a tall school gate, which is the National Peiping Railway Management College.</p>
<p>Its predecessor was Beijing Jiaotong University, abbreviated as Jiaoda Pingyuan, which, together with Shanghai Jiaotong University (abbreviated as Jiaoda Huxiao) and Tangshan Jiaotong University (abbreviated as Jiaoda Tangyuan), were like three brothers, sharing the same lineage. It is just that they have recently separated and become independent.</p>
<p>Currently, the school is divided into four departments: Transportation, Materials, Finance, and Business Management, with a total of more than 400 students. The professors hired are mostly well-known domestic experts or veterans in the transportation industry, all of whom are deeply learned and virtuous. In terms of curriculum, both theory and practice are emphasized. In the first year, in addition to the Ministry-designated Chinese, English, Economics, Physics, Calculus, and Engineering Books, there are also Principles of Accounting and Principles of Economics, which are different from ordinary schools. In the second year, in addition to the publicly required courses, the Finance Department focuses on Advanced Economics, Advanced Accounting, Public Finance, Public and Private Finance, Business Administration, Money and Banking, etc. The Transportation Department focuses on Passenger Transportation, Freight Transportation, etc. In the third and fourth years, the main courses are Freight Car Allocation, Freight Rates, Railway Operation, Railway Accounting, Vehicle Construction, and Road Engineering.</p>
<p>In terms of equipment, in addition to a library of considerable size, which is sufficient for students to engage in pragmatic and truthful exploration and research, there are also small-scale tracks, locomotives, bridges and culverts, signals, and station equipment, so that students can engage in theoretical exploration on the one hand, and practical exercises on the other. Because there are not many students, the student dormitories are very spacious, and large rooms usually accommodate only two or three people. Therefore, they often say: "Among the universities in Peiping, we can say that the problem of accommodation is the most comfortable."</p>
<p>In order to train middle-level railway cadres, in addition to the university section, there is also a secondary technical department attached to it in Wangfucang Hutong, Xicheng, which is divided into three classes: Railway Operations, Telecommunications, and Business, graduating in three years. Their courses are largely the same as those in the university section, so although it is stipulated that junior high school graduates can apply, there are many high school students among them. However, the secondary technical department does not recruit female students, which is a bit of a pity!</p>
<p>The new student entrance examination was originally scheduled for mid-July, but due to problems in the old examination hall, it has been delayed until mid-August. This year's enrollment is only in the Shanghai and Peiping areas. The Shanghai area will be at the National Shanghai Business College, with registration dates on August 9th, 10th, and 11th.</p>
<p>One of the great advantages of this school is that there is no problem with students' future careers. All of this year's graduates have been employed, and some even have several positions to choose from.</p>
<p>Young friends, if you are willing to dedicate yourselves to transportation and work hard for the construction of a new China, please prepare well!</p>
<h3>World Games Opening Ceremony Our Delegation Shines Rong Qizhao and Song Jun Lead Huang Tianxi Holds the Flag</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, London, 29th] The 14th World Games held its opening ceremony at Wembley Stadium on the afternoon of the 29th. Our country's 44 delegates, dressed in blue tops and white trousers and full of spirit, were greeted with cheers by 80,000 spectators as they marched around the stadium and passed in front of the British Royal Box. Rong Qizhao, leader of our delegation's mountain football team, and Song Junfu, coach of the basketball team, led the way, entering the venue from the eastern underground passage. Huang Tianxi, our basketball team's guard, tall and strong, standing six feet three inches tall, held our national flag. All our delegates followed in two rows. After our delegation entered the stadium, they were listed as the 14th team, according to alphabetical order. The American team had the largest number of athletes, with a total of 400 people. The smallest was the Singapore team with one person. After the magnificent procession of all athletes circled the stadium, our Secretary-General Dong Shouyi entered the venue together with other members of the World Games Committee and stood in front of the Royal Box. The weather was extremely hot today, and more than a dozen spectators fainted. However, members of British society still dressed up to attend, with men in tuxedos and women in long skirts. Any major British event is a social occasion, and the presence of the King and Queen of England gives the World Games a very high status in social terms.</p>
<p>Opening Ceremony Photo</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, London, 29th] The opening ceremony of the 14th World Games was held this afternoon. Wembley Stadium was magnificent and solemn. The wide red runway and the flat, tender green grass field were surrounded by colorful national flags of various countries. At the beginning of the opening ceremony, the Guards in red uniforms and bearskin hats appeared at the entrance of the underground tunnel, followed by the King's Guards in gold uniforms and purple hats, and then the Scottish pipe band. After the members of the International Olympic Committee in top hats took their seats, officials Attlee, Eden, foreign envoys from France, Italy, the Netherlands, Belgium, and Chile, Queen Mary, various royal families, the Mountbatten couple, and UN Secretary-General Trygve Lie, etc., entered the arena to the sound of military music. When King George and his family arrived at the arena, the entire venue immediately fell silent and stood up. The military band played the British national anthem. While the King received the members of the Olympic Committee, the Queen and Princess Margaret stepped into the royal box. The athletes' parade immediately began, led by Greek athletes, with athletes from each country led by their national flags. The athletes wore lantern trousers and sports shirts and hats of various colors. The athletes' teams from each country lowered their flags to salute as they passed in front of the throne. The representatives of Australia and the Philippines even took off their hats to salute. The cheering and applause were incessant. The athletes' parade lasted for forty minutes, with the British team at the end. After the inspection, the athletes from each country lined up facing the King of England. King George solemnly declared through a loudspeaker: "I declare the 14th World Games of the modern era in 1948 open." A thousand white pigeons circled over the stadium and then flew to various places, spreading the news of the opening of the Games. Then, a 21-gun salute was fired. British athlete John Mark arrived at the stadium with the Olympic torch in the last burst of the salute, circled the stadium, and then used the fire to light the Olympic flame on the left side of the stadium. After the prayer of the Bishop of Newchurch, British World Games athlete Finley swore on behalf of all athletes: "For the glory of the country and sports, we must show loyalty in sports." The opening ceremony of the World Games was completed in the sound of the British national anthem sung by the entire audience. The audience filed out of the stadium, and the athletes from each country returned to their camps to prepare for the battle tomorrow. Following Romania and Bulgaria's withdrawal from the World Games, a total of 59 countries are currently participating in the Games.</p>

<h3>Superfluous "Appeasing"</h3>
<p>— Jingwen</p>
<p>I believe that apart from the followers of asceticism, ordinary people probably do not oppose improving the enjoyment of human life. The ultimate goal of culture and civilization is nothing more than improving and raising the living standards of mankind. Therefore, although our living conditions are far from comfortable, for all social improvement measures that are beneficial to a comfortable life, even if I am not fortunate enough to enjoy them, I always express my support as an observer. Even if it is nearly extravagant behavior, as long as it is reasonable, I am willing to be optimistic about its success.</p>
<p>For example, take travel. In today's world of widespread fire and ubiquitous disasters, to be harsh, travel should be considered an almost luxurious affair. However, I absolutely do not take that view, and believe that even in this chaotic world, as long as one's personal strength allows it, and there is no guilt in one's conscience, then an occasional weekend trip is not too much to criticize. Moreover, the vicissitudes of life are unpredictable, and human life is limited. Timely enjoyment also has a kind of spiritual need. A person who has "copper coins" and is willing to "use two cents" on relatively meaningful enjoyment can be considered to understand the principles of being human.</p>
<p>Since travel is a kind of enjoyment, all facilities related to travel should be meticulously researched, striving to make travelers happy to spend money without complaint. Conversely, the organizations that operate travel businesses should, of course, aim to make money. Only then can it be called a fair transaction. Many countries in Europe regard operating travel businesses as a major source of foreign exchange income. For example, the Queen Elizabeth, the luxurious ship launched by Britain after the war, aims to serve wealthy American tourists in exchange for US dollars. Therefore, not only is the interior decoration of the ship luxurious, but the extravagance of its food supply even aroused the question of the British Parliament. Because at present, the entire British people are dominated by a rationing system, if there is one more egg on the Sunday breakfast table, it is considered an amazing enjoyment. However, on that luxurious ship dedicated to the enjoyment of wealthy American tourists, not to mention that eggs and butter are all available, but also venison! However, the reply from the British government authorities is that if Britain wants to earn foreign exchange, it has to tighten its own belt first.</p>
<p>China's current situation is naturally not comparable to that of Britain, because although they are tightening their belts, they have also implemented the National Social Insurance Law from cradle to grave. If I were also British, not to mention tightening my belt without a word of complaint, even if I were to starve to death, I would be willing, because being born in a country that has hope, personal sacrifice is a valuable contribution.</p>
<p>I've digressed, let's talk about travel again. This reminds me of the so-called "air-conditioned trains" (which are said to have now been renamed "express trains") that the two railway authorities have recently been vigorously promoting. In China's transportation industry, apart from the postal service, which has become universally praised, the railway industry cannot be denied its considerable achievements, especially the railway repair teams in the war zones, whose spirit and ability have won praise from both China and foreign countries. Even in the case of the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway Bureaus, at least judging from the achievements they have promoted in the past two or three years, they have made progress.</p>
<p>But this time's "air-conditioned train", I still think is a superfluous "appeasing". Air-conditioned trains, American "Pullman" cars probably already have them. However, America is America. America's universal production capacity has turned some waste into a necessary consumption. For example, we are eating rationed sugar, while they, men, women, old and young, each have a "Wrigley's Spearmint". If Americans don't waste some more, it's bound to be a "sin".</p>
<p>However, we are ultimately different. Using the class of train to compare our national economy with that of the United States, we are good enough to be able to squeeze into the third or fourth class of the "international train". What we need today is not some air-conditioned train, but to open a few more window holes on the fourth-class car, and add a cover to the tarp car. Even if we say that our current technical ability is sufficient to build air-conditioned trains (according to the results of the trial, this is still a problem), it is actually unnecessary, because the train, when it is running, is already cool enough with the windows open. Now, to deliberately close the windows and use air-conditioning, isn't that close to waste - and unreasonable waste?</p>
<p>Taking a step back, even if we admit that air-conditioned trains have their needs, this need is of course for a few special people, and for the sake of the interests of state-owned enterprises, they should logically raise their prices to a reasonable level. However, it is said that the current highest fare is only worth about one US dollar. This amount is naturally large enough in the eyes of ordinary people, but you must know that many materials in the transportation industry are purchased with the country's foreign exchange. Foreigners have repeatedly criticized China for state-owned enterprises operated with foreign exchange materials, which not only fail to make money for the government, but instead cause the government to lose money. It is said that the fare for a sleeper car from Shanghai to Nanjing, a distance of 180 miles, is only equivalent to 80 US cents. For example, taking a China National Aviation Corporation plane from Shanghai to Hong Kong costs about 16 US dollars, while taking the same plane back to Shanghai from Hong Kong, calculated in Hong Kong dollars, costs about 70 US dollars. This shows that the British are indeed much smarter than us.</p>
<p>The purpose of this article is not to advocate high prices, but for things that are not "for the public to sit on" and that need to be maintained by foreign exchange, it is believed that it is necessary to seek a reasonable pricing. Otherwise, it is too much to plan for the rich. The price limit policy for cinemas should also be applied to certain state-owned enterprises.</p>
<h3>Diary Literature</h3>
<p>— Qian Dacheng</p>
<p>The earliest diary is probably Huang Shangu's "Family Record"? According to Lu Fangweng's "Notes from the Old Study Hut", "Huang Luzhi has a diary, called the Family Record, and he did not stop writing it even in Yizhou." Other books, such as Fan Chengda's "Record of the Wu Boat" and Lu Fangweng's "Record of Entering Shu", all use the style of a diary to record events. But the official name of diary, I am afraid, is Guo Tianxi's "Diary of a Guest in Hangzhou" in the Yuan Dynasty. Later, some people changed the name to "Daily Record", such as Zhu Zuwen's "Northern Journey Daily Record" in the Ming Dynasty. Some people also call it "Daily Register".</p>
<p>By the late Qing Dynasty, diaries were very popular, and politicians, scholars, and writers all had diaries, some of which lasted for decades without interruption. The most famous, of course, is Zeng Wenzheng Gong's diary, Wang Renqiu's "Xiangqilou Diary", Li Ci's "Yue Mantang Diary", Ye Changchi's "Green Du Lu Diary Notes", Weng Tonghe's diary, Zhao Liewen's fifty-four-volume "Neng Jing Ju Diary", which contains a lot of historical data on the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom, but unfortunately it was not printed and was sold by his son. Yuan Shikai and Duan Qirui both had diaries. Last year, I met Ms. Yi Zhi, the daughter of Duan Lao (she is Yuan Shikai's niece-in-law) in Suzhou. She mentioned it and agreed to lend it to me for reading. "Yue Mantang Diary" was hidden by Fan Fanshan for several volumes and is no longer complete. The manuscript has also been bought by a gentleman from Zhejiang Xingye Bank. "Green Du Lu Diary Notes" had already deleted many trivial matters and scolding parts, leaving only the discussion of editions, inscriptions, and the description of exams and officialdom. Describing trivial matters and scolding people is the most able to show the author's true character, buying the casket and returning the pearl, it is really a pity. Fortunately, the original manuscript was donated to the Suzhou Provincial Gang Library last year, and the true face of Mount Lu is not difficult to re-examine. Other books, such as Yu Dafu's "Nine Kinds of Diaries", Xu Zhimo's "Love Eyebrow Small Notes", Zheng Zhenduo's "Seeking Books Daily Record",... are all very interesting, or have academic value. Tao Menghe's proofread and printed Hua Xuelan's "Xin Chou Diary" records the actual situation of the Qing Dynasty exams in great detail. The examiners demanded illegal fees from local officials, and actually regarded them as regular income, carefully calculating them without shame; the examiners borrowed money to take office, and when they returned, they had hundreds of pieces of luggage, and others also regarded it as natural and did not find it strange. This kind of real situation can never be seen in official articles. The value of diaries lies in this. I have also been keeping a diary for many years. Occasionally, when I read it, the shadows of the past are like a past life. When I see the prices recorded in the diary a few years ago, compared with the prices this year, I feel that the previous days were really too good, but now I can still get through it. Those who come after will look at today as today looks at the past. So I am not pessimistic about the future. Reading the diaries of the ancients does not mean that I miss the "Prosperous Era of Qianlong and Jiaqing"; because the people of the "Prosperous Era of Qianlong and Jiaqing" were also worried about wind, rain, rice, and salt in their diaries.</p>
<h3>Talking About Aphorisms</h3>
<p>— Ji Mo</p>
<p>There are some readers who like to read "aphorisms", so some writers do not hesitate to work hard and specialize in writing aphorisms as their skill. If a text is plain or empty from beginning to end, the reader will not be interested. I think that in this hot summer weather, it would be strange if that writer did not doze off halfway through writing.</p>
<p>It is said that the American publishing industry pays great attention to business sense. Especially some detective and supernatural books are full of aphorisms to attract readers. I have read a lot of this kind of books. Here, because I am writing at a friend's desk, I cannot cite the original book. I will try to imitate the general meaning and come up with a few examples.</p>
<p>This type of sentence is often inserted at the beginning of each chapter, making people love to hold it in their hands and reluctant to let go. For example, in a detective novel, we can read the following similar words:</p>
<p>"In a dark alley, there is a shadow wriggling."</p>
<p>"A letter without a signature was found on the round table in the dance hall. I don't know who sent it."</p>
<p>"The tall Carl was stabbed in the back with a dagger and fell down."</p>
<p>"John was drafting a letter at his desk. He suddenly looked up and saw a pale and dangerous woman standing in front of the table."</p>
<p>Naturally, aphorisms can also be arranged at the end of an article, leaving people with endless aftertaste after reading. No matter what the work, if the author writes well at the end, it is easier to make readers never forget it. For example, Maugham's short story in Life Events, after narrating the adventurous experiences of a wealthy son in Monte Carlo, said that a person does not need to be talented, as long as he is lucky. Sometimes I look at many people who are not appreciated for their talents, and I sigh. Also, the Chinese proverb says, "A fool has a fool's luck." I feel that Maugham's words have some meaning. But it is too unreliable to entrust everything in life to luck.</p>
<h3>Queen of Ties</h3>
<p>— Mao Yi</p>
<p>More than ten years ago, a stage actress came to Hollywood, the city of movies, but every studio closed its doors to her. Her silver screen dream shattered, and in extreme boredom, she remembered a woman she met on her travels who made a living selling ties. Why not imitate her? So, she hired a female worker who tailored ties of various colors and began selling her products in Los Angeles and Hollywood.</p>
<p>The business was unexpectedly good, and the first batch of products quickly sold out. At the same time, she discovered that entering the studio as a tie merchant was an extremely easy thing. With her cleverness, talent, and excellent products, directors, actors, screenwriters, and all kinds of film workers became her patrons. Now, people in the city of movies affectionately call her the "Queen of Ties."</p>
<p>This "queen," who specializes in men's business, is Miss Belle Green. She has almost become the city of movies' special clothing staff, because most of the actors' ties are bought from her. She knows which patterns the big stars like, and she tells them which tie to wear with which clothes.</p>
<p>Don't underestimate a tie, it has also caused a stir in the city of movies! When Irving Beecher was an actor, once, while he was filming, his father-in-law came to see him. Irving was wearing a black and white striped tie from Miss Green, and his father-in-law loved it at first sight. In order to please him, Irving immediately gave it to him after the scene was filmed. The old man happily wore the new tie home to show off. Unfortunately, at this time, the company suddenly felt that there was something unsatisfactory during the test screening and ordered Irving to reshoot a segment. But the tie was gone! Even more unfortunately, Green was away at the time, and the same tie could not be found anywhere!</p>
<p>During the reshoot, Irving almost covered his throat with his hands so as not to expose the difference in the ties. Since then, the film company has formulated a rule: all clothing must be kept for three months after the film is finished - if Miss Green had become a "Movie Queen" instead of a "Tie Queen," she probably would not have such authority!</p>
<h3>Swindling the Gods</h3>
<p>— Kuan Nai</p>
<p>Stephen Weinberg, an American from Brooklyn, can be rightly called the "King of Swindlers" of the United States. In the thirty years from 1913 to 1943, this person used twenty-five different aliases and committed countless acts of trickery. His attitude was extremely calm, his behavior was very natural, and no one would have thought that he was a swindler. He repeatedly impersonated senior officials of the U.S. government to invite prominent figures from foreign countries to travel to the U.S., taking the opportunity to profit from them. In 1921, he even brought Princess Fatima of Afghanistan to the United States in the name of the U.S. government. After the princess arrived with a large number of attendants, the swindler went to swindle the U.S. government, and he actually achieved the goal of holding a banquet at the White House. Not only that, President Harding actually attended the banquet in person, and the swindler actually introduced the Afghan princess to President Harding in person. It was not until many years later that someone became suspicious and finally discovered that he was originally a swindler.</p>
<h3>More Delicate Than Hair</h3>
<p>— Yanbo</p>
<p>The most meticulous craftsman in the world today is James W. Zaharee, who lives in North Dakota, USA. Recently, with the help of a microscope, he used a steel pen with an extremely sharp tip to write the full text of President Lincoln's famous speech delivered at Gettysburg on a hair less than three inches long. The speech contains 270 words, totaling 1,175 letters.</p>
<p>###</p>
<p>The impact of paper money being "large" once, then again "large," on the general public is naturally felt first in Shanghai, the economic and nerve center with its advantageous location. As for the "dignified model" of the new currency, the admiration in Tianjin and Beijing is slightly delayed. However, with the arrival of a telegram, the continuous fluctuations in the market situation seem to concede little. This matter certainly has a significant stimulating effect, but once, twice, thrice, like medicine, one stimulation after another, the feeling transforms from acute pain to numbness. The previous time, the sudden "large" leap from ten thousand to one hundred thousand caused the citizens' expressions to change from worried frowns to bitter smiles. This time, the "large" jump is even more drastic (ten to five hundred), but observing the "market appearance," one finds even fewer bitter smiles; there is no reaction, no expression. Some who do mention it say to each other, "Whatever they say, goes!" It is as if we have returned to ancient times, where "people did not know, did not understand, they followed the rules of the Emperor." Mencius spoke of "the people of a true king, so content and satisfied!" How prosperous is this age!</p>
<p>In Beijing dialect, those who buy goods for personal use are called "users," and using funds to buy goods is called "buying." If merchants buy goods to resell for profit, it is called "grabbing." If someone buys from a fellow merchant and then resells, it is called "inter-trade trading." The method of bargaining involves "sign language," with both parties shaking hands in their sleeves or covering them with cloth, using the size of their fingers to represent the amounts they are asking for or offering. Since the purpose of "grabbing goods" is to resell them, they do not want others to know the original purchase price, so that when they resell, whether at a large profit or a loss, they will not be criticized. The locations for "grabbing goods" are mostly the "small markets" in each city. The source of goods for the small vendors in the small markets is often from "drum beaters" (who specialize in going to each household to buy goods, carrying large baskets on their shoulders and shaking small drums), or directly from households, or they buy from small markets in one place and sell in small markets in another. This situation has been around for a long time. However, since the Japanese invaders launched their war, the situation has been turbulent, inflation has gradually increased, and life has become abnormal, and those who "grab" and those who "run" are increasingly busy and numerous, symbolizing the chaos of the entire economic situation. (No "capital," no "movement"; the larger the paper money, the more vigorous the swimming. No "gang," no "running"; no "goods," no "grabbing.")</p>
<p>Just like in normal times in various public markets and small markets, one only sees "grabbers" (merchants), "drum beaters," and buyers (users), but now, middle-class ladies and young ladies (and there are also older and younger gentlemen, but some hold current positions, or are past officials and gentry, afraid of embarrassment), often sell their own clothes. Moreover, some have joined in "grabbing goods," reselling for profit to supplement their household expenses. The steps of reselling are becoming increasingly hurried, getting them early, selling them quickly. Making money, quickly buying goods; having goods in hand, quickly exchanging them for money. This is the so-called "flipping back and forth," living in the midst of it. Paper money cannot be saved, nor can it be lent at interest, so one can only "grab" and "run."</p>
<h3>Minor Illness</h3>
<p>— Zheng Wuchang</p>
<p>Sometimes rain, sometimes sun, sometimes warm, sometimes cold, clumsy in caring for myself, difficult to live. As old age descends, I face great changes, in the season of plums and yellowing, my bones naturally ache.</p>
<p>Ill in bed, I truly imagine Mt. Li, difficult to transfer its spirit onto my pillow. It's not that the master is greedy for a high bed, but tell the person in the hall to bring paints.</p>
<h3>Returning from Dengwei Mountain</h3>
<p>— Deng Chushou</p>
<p>Year after year, painting groves on paper, exploring the wonders of the Five Sacred Mountains, year after year. Dengwei's plum blossoms are hundreds of miles away, but today I turn and see my home mountain.</p>
