<h3>改編下半年總預算案　立院決議退還政院　請另編追加預算送院審議</h3>

<h3>社論　從國營事業加價問題說起</h3>
<p>國營事業又在　讓着漲價了；尤其是交通公用事業，加價　將勢在必行。在這些事業的主持者，以事業本身成太增加，要求加價以維持事業；政府亦不能以繼續負担貼補，致影響到國庫收支的平衡，頗有允准調整價格的趨勢。但立法院方面，則以國營事業的加價足以刺激民心，影警幣値、又主張國營事　裁員緊縮，或由政府另行設法，彌補其損失。加價固有加價的理由，制止加價也有制止加價的理由，眞是「公說公有理，婆設　有理」。某立委說：「國營事業若加價、人民受不了，不加價則國家受不了」。這一問題的不易解決，可謂一語道破，大槪這一個半月間已經傷透了一般政治家和專家的　筋！</p>
<p>其實，問題的癥結，不在國營的事菜應否加價，而在整個經濟改革方案有了光天的漏洞，執行技術又犯了因果　置的錯誤。方案中，明明規定各種稅收要參照戰前標凖調整，國營和公用交通事菜的收費也要參照戰前標準調整，而全國各地各種物品及勞務價格，則要依照民國三十七年八月十九日各該地各種物品貨價，依兌換率折合金圓券出售。這似乎無異說，國營事業和稅收可以調整到戰前的標凖。民營事業和人民的勞力則要凍結在「八一九」的限價。如此矛盾，寗非漏洞？但竟在關係着國家人民榮枯禍福的經濟改革方案中淸淸楚楚地訂了出來，怎敎人事後補救？試想。稅率旣然提高了，物品的或太當然也要提高了，動力和運輸費用增加了，物品的成本當然也又增加了，物品的成本高了，而物品的價格却只許釘住在限價以內，這敎從事於生產事業的人民如何受得了？受不了，祗得逐漸停工關門、而停工關門却又爲政府所不許。何况停工關門的後果，當然又是失業的增加與物資的缺乏。如此這般，循環往復，卽使幣制改革得到百分之百的成功，對於國計民生究有甚麽裨</p>
<p>再說，要控制物價，就要全面的控制。若祇是控制了甲地的物價，而沒有控制着乙地丙地的物價，祗是控制了成品的價格，而沒有控制着原料的價格，又豈能使各方各得其平？姑以燃料的柴油舉例：柴油是工業和航業的原動力，尤其是航業，燃料的消費要佔成太的最大部份。要使運費不加價，先要使得柴油不漲價纔對；但柴油來自外國，外國生意人就不肯服你這一套，他們說要漲價就得漲價，否則停止供應，那就祗得任他們漲價了。現在柴油價格已　起了百分之一百，而運費却要釘住在「八一九」的限價、試問事業又怎麽維持下去？難怪船聯會第二次會員大會開會，又要呼籲他們的困難了。過去甩的是結匯方式、無異由政府暗中貼補。現在政府對於公用交通事業的貼補再也吃不消了，那又怎麽辦呢？難道政府所吃不消的貼補，人民經營的事業就吃得消伊於胡底的賠累嗎？到了人民吃不消的時候、也祗有出於關門停業之一途。公用交通事業比不得別的事業。與人民生活息息相關，他們果眞停止了一天的供應，就要由一家哭而至於一路哭了！從前在法幣時期，政府不願聞到哭聲，不時地把各項價格調整着，油價調整了，或是外　掛高了，運費也跟着調整了，物品成本加高了，物價跟着上漲了，生活指教也隨之提高了，運費又不得不再度調整了，如此循環下去，物價就漫無止境的上昇，法幣也不顧一切的膨脹，互相競賽而至於無可收拾。這是法幣時期的作風、也是法幣的致命之傷；其致傷之由，實是執行技術的倒因爲果。現在幣制改革，旣是祗許成功不許失敗的、就應當以過去的失敗作爲前車之鑒。</p>
<p>在實施經濟改革方案之前，不要手忙脚亂，如果先把各項稅收調整好了國營·公用·交通事業的價格也調整好了，各項物價任其自然趨勢也調整好了，生活指數也依照最近的物價精確地調整好了，然後在一適當的時期突然公佈切實可行的全面經濟改革方案，當不致有今天的種種技節問題的發生，看烟的稅率如果在改革以前就調整好了，何至因香烟價格的增加而致發生擔購物品的風潮？國營，公用，交通事業的價格如果在改革以前調整好了，燃料的柴油在改革以前由國營的石油公司購備充足了，何至使今天的立法院左右爲難？成事不說，後悔已遲，但我們究竟不當讓　　續錯誤下去，再蹈法幣時期的覆轍。換句話說，行政和立法的當局，就該打開天窗說亮話，大家認淸當前的現實，作澈庭的糾正，使得未來的危機得以及時挽救，經濟的改革得以全部成功。</p>
<p>要使經濟改革全部成功，固然要使得人民受得了，政府也受得了，但更要使得一切從事生產者，從事營運者，同樣的受得了，那經濟的活動纔能繼續不斷，人民的生活　不致發生影醫。我們須知一切正當工商事業者，都與生產有關的，不可以爲只有開工廠方是生產，而辦航業，辦交通，辦公用事業，辦金融，辦保險，就不是生產者。經濟改革方案因爲是急就章，不免有許多漏洞存在，籌統命令中也責成行政院隨時規定補充辦法的。故行政當局應有勇氣速為補救，而執行方面也不可只知依據着公佈的刻版方案，不爲亡羊補牢之計。我們以爲政府不妨快把各項物品的成本來通盤計算一番，把各項物品的價格來重新作一番合理的調整，而國營，公用，交通事業，當然也不在例外。經此合理調整以後，限價的嚴格執行，　不致發生極大困難，而人民的生計也可望就此逐漸安定下來。若至今還漢視現實只喊一句不准衝破「八一九」的物價防綫，而沒有注意到「八一九」的生產量現在是否還能維持，　未免知其一而不知其二了。</p>
<p>今天中樞聞將討論擬訂制止搶購　　　法，也注意到如何增加生產，如何疏導物資來源了，也知道合便調整與漲價不同了，那麼我們願政府作一番總的合理調整，而不是各穩物價而環不已的調整。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕巴黎八日廣播；據傳聯大主席澳外長伊伐特及聯合國秘書長賴依刻正與四强作非正式接洽，籲請四强對柏林休戰三個月，俾四强外長會議得有充分時間，以討論持久之解決辦法。官方對此傳說不願表示意見，但英美發言人謂各該國政府不致接受此種暫時休戰之建議</p>
<p>〔合衆社巴黎八日電〕據悉：安理會蘇聯以外之各國代表團在私人會談中，八日已獲致要求蘇聯解除柏林封鎖之一般意見。消息靈通方面稱；妥協之方案業在幕後擬定，方案中提議同時採取行動，一面解除柏林封鎖，一面則恢復四强外長會議，討論對德和約問題。成爲東西衝突中心之安理會及政治委會，八日均未預定開會。</p>
<p>據悉：西方三强已撒至幕後，而讓安理會其他六中立國家採取主動，計劃打破柏林封鎖之聯合國行動，以阿根廷代表勃拉馬格里亞爲調解人之許多非正式會談，將在八日舉行。中立國家認爲東西間可能妥協之方式甚多，此種方式必可防止長期衝突，避免使本屆聯大毫無成就。</p>
<p>〔合衆社巴黎八日電〕阿根廷外長勃拉馬格里亞八日積極負起調停柏林危機之責任，與蘇代表維辛斯基談話一小時有餘，以覓取折衷解決辦法。兩氏長談內容，迄今秘而不宣，卽其折衷辦法之性質亦無從知悉。然據確悉，與柏林糾紛無關之安理會理事國所同意之辦法，與美國之建議相差無幾。可靠方面稱，勃氏及維辛斯基對八日之談話均甚表滿意。勃氏八口尙擬與中國代表蔣廷　及蘇聯唯一助手烏克蘭外長曼紐斯基談話。</p>

<p>按上述西班牙兩黨領袖，客秋曾訪晤貝文外相，據悉，貝文當時曾鼓勵渠等合作，藉以促使西班牙政權能以和平方式變更英。外部昨日雖否認馬歇爾曾與美法代表接觸，企圖解除聯合國對西班牙之決議，然此間人士仍相信馬歇爾曾爲可否允許西班牙加入西歐聯盟一事，在巴黎向英法外長徵求意見。</p>
<p>〔合衆社倫敦八日電〕西班牙保王黨與社會黨已訂立反弗朗哥合作條約，且已於本週提交西歐五國及美國政府。官方八日雖拒絕透露保王黨談判人之姓名，然一般咸稱魯倍爾必魯擔任重要角色，蓋去年魯氏訪問倫敦時，社會黨魁普利托適在英京，魯氏已在倫敦登報否認其事，英官員亦不堅稱魯氏簽名於條約上。</p>
<p>〔合衆社馬德里九日電〕英外部宣佈西班牙保王黨及社會黨已簽訂合作條約後，此間外部發，人八日斥之爲「偏夜之消息，當然令人憎恨，足證倫敦屢次攻擊西班牙」，　　普利托已在葡葡牙發言否，是覓英外部妄自批評他國内政，而前後矛盾不一。又稱，西外部已訓令駐英公使向英外部抗驕。</p>

<p>〔中央社威爾士蘭都諾七日電〕英保守黨舉行全國大會，本日討論帝國政策之主要點，爲「增强不列顚聯合國爲一戰略及經濟單位」，會議一致通過議決案，强調此項要求者，並通過修正案一項，主張竭力促成撥棄日內瓦貿易條約，並不批准哈瓦那會議所訂之規章，以兩者均限制帝國優惠權利。若干代表深恐歐洲合衆國計劃，可能危及英國之帝國經濟權益。</p>

<p>蘆田內閣因昭和公司大貪汚案之影響而辭職後，十月十一日召開之國會特別會議中，第一件事卽爲選舉新首相。特別會議係在二週前決定召開，召開之目的，在通過公務員法修正法案及調整公務員基薪法案。松岡計劃邀請四要政黨首領會商，並要求渠等合作，以組成四黨聯合内閣。松岡稱：關於新首相之人選，及新內閣之政策，必須達成協議，以免在國會開會以後，形成各黨爭奪之現象。但困難則在國會中任何政黨，均不能佔據絕對多數。一般預測：新閣必然為極度右傾者，因社會民主黨已宣稱渠等不擬參加新政府。極度有傾之民主自由黨黨魁以前曾出任首相之吉田茂，呼聲最高。因民主自由黨在國會中所佔議席最多，但因其他保守政黨對之均無好感，可能使渠之當選發生阻礙，</p>
<p>〔新亞社東京八日電〕因籌備下屆總理大臣提名而忙於奔走之衆議院議長，八日晨訪問民主自由黨總裁吉田後，卽至首相官邸訪問民主黨總裁蘆田。午後並繼續訪問社會黨委員長片山，國民協同黨委員長三木，及社會革新黨書記長佐竹等人，交換關於下屆內閣首揆提名之意見。</p>
<p>〔新亞社南京八日電〕自蘆田內閣總辭職之消息傳至此間後，我政府方面及一般關心日本政情人幹，均表深切之注意。記者頃走訪某政界權威人士，據稱：「關於蘆田內閣總辭職一事，早在吾人意料之中，惟其因大貪污案之擊連而垮台，則頗為難堪。至於後繼內閣首揆人選問題，吾人一不願妄加推測與評論，然爲日本日本眞正步上民主與復興之路，亦惟有此項份子主持本政治，始能獲得國際上之支援。」</p>

<h3>總檢查完成過半數　十餘商號擅動物資　滬相查獲大規模地下倉庫</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕本市物資總檢査於昨日開始，全日經過情形極爲順利，迄晚各區平均已査畢百分之六十以上，預計今日可如期全部完成。一般檢査結果，以黄浦老閘新成嵩山等區査獲未報及超過登記數字物資爲數較多。上午六時起，社會局，市警局，靑年服務隊，民政局，憲兵團，警備司令部，兩路局警務處等各單位所派工作人員五千六百人，分別向劃定區域内指揮地點報到集中，八時後分組出發。全市分三十指揮區，由各分局長任指揮之職。總指揮仐叔平局長坐鎭警察總局八樓總指揮部，並於淸晨檢査開始時親赴黄浦，嵩山，老閘等區，會同各該分局長親自出動赴若干倉庫檢査，下午又驅車巡視各區工作情形。經濟警察大隊長程義寬担任聯絡組組長，於檢査開始前在警察局電台向市民廣播，放於總指揮部接聽各區工作人員之電話諮詢，指示工作進行。總指揮部電話鈴聲整日不絕於耳。各組工作人員到達檢査地點後，會同當地保甲長至應檢査之倉庫店號，出示出勤證，査閱該廠商倉庫之營業執照，根據登記證撿査貨物數量，相符者在登記證背面蓋章査訖，不，符者加以封存，呈候核辦。査獲之未報及超過登記數字，有一部份係廠家繼續生產，因而數量增多，此外有若干廠商之物資分存於數區，以致在某一區之倉庫内物資不足登記表上數字，而在另一區之倉庫内除表列物資外尙有其他物資。遇有此稱情形，當時僅能核對倉庫賬册，將俟總檢査完成後綜合査對·截至昨曉止，靜安區進行最快，已完成百分之八十一，楡林，吳淞兩區亦已完成百分之八十，新成，黄浦均在百分之五十以上，老閘區因數量較多，僅査畢百分之三十四。今日繼續檢査，決可如期完成。</p>

<h3>經管當局深夜聲明　絨綫報請漲價審議會未批准</h3>
<p>〔中央社本市訊〕關於絨綫調整價格事，據經濟督導員辦公處發言人昨日深夜發表消息稱：社會局已將毛紡業公會所造具之成本表，報請物價審議會核定，現該會尙未批准，在該會未批准以前，絨綫價格，不得擅漲。</p>
<p>社局核定漲五成</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕據社局息：毛紡業工業同業公會爲成本一關係，呈請社會局調整絨綫價格，茲經核定上漲五成，自昨日起實行。並發表新價如下；高級組絨每磅十八圓四角（四蜂·英雄地球·皇后等牌）。中級組絨每磅十五圓五角（如杜鵑、綠美等牌）。低級粗絨每磅十一圓九角（小囡·雙洋·學士等牌）。高級細絨每磅廿五圓一角（三蜂。地球，皇后等牌）。</p>
<p>局長談話</p>
<p>社會局長吳開先爲絨綫價格一調整事特發表談話稱：絨綫於八一九時尙無廠盤，祇少數店舖有售。社會局卽據此核定門售限價。後公會於開盤時要求核定廠盤價，毛紡業代表並向蔣督導員請示，督導員辦公處囑由社會局審核。社會局乃令公會造具生產成本，因與門售限價距離甚遠，爲鄭重起見，特送請中紡公司毛紡部審核。經審核結果，所需生產成本與公會提出之數字相仿。上週六上海區物價審議會開會時乃提出報吿，經對論後，即照中紡公司審核之生產成本杖定新價。</p>
<p>希望市民苦衷</p>
<p>吳局長認爲限價之目的如使工廠停閉不生產，則此一限價政策係屬失敗。絨綫因原料外匯與關稅成本高漲，已至不能維持境地，安樂毛絨廠即因缺乏羊毛原料已於一週前停工，政府爲維持工廠永久生產起見，按生產成本調整限價，希市民對政府維持工商業之苦衷能予諒解。</p>

<p>（一）中央爲節省外滙，减少汽油輸入，本市汽油配額亦隨之减少（以前本市配油量共有二百廿萬加侖，現在速工業用油在內，祗有一百十五萬加侖。）市政府於九月底奉到中央汽車汽油節約命令，事實上如欲推行合理之配給，事先須有充分之凖備，現在奉令推行時間甚爲匆促，因即依照汽車汽油節約委員會之決定，辦理如下：（甲）凡公務機關及合乎中央規定身份之私法人（即銀行，工廠，礦塲，及規模宏大與民生日用必需品有關之民營事業），均照「四去一」之原則辦理，其四輛中之三輛，配給規定油量，其餘一輛配給基本油量（小型車十介侖，大型車二十介侖）。（乙）凡合規定身份之私法人則照「二去一」之原則辦理，其二輛中之一輛，配給規定油量，另一輛配給基本油量。（丙）凡合乎規定之私人，即註册醫師，一輛配給規定油量，其餘均給基本油量。（丁）凡不介規定私人，一槪配給基本油量。</p>
<p>（二）爲顧全實際需要，爰有印發申請書之辦法，俾一都份確有特殊需要之理由者，得有申請之機會，爲早日佔計此項增配油量起見，凡軍主需要申請者，務希在本月十五日以前，將由請書送交漢口路一三九號公用局第四處。以便早日提會審査。</p>
<p>（三）爲相互配合·免致無法供應起見，對於申請各戶。當視本市油量與實際需要情形，統籌辦理。</p>
<h3>高雄酒樓接洽運滬供應</h3>
<p>王參事補充略謂：據審査小組會議審査結果，本市油量單照以上四項規定配給，已餘油無幾，又本市有汽車之醫師計三四百人，市府通吿凡合乎中央規定使用汽車者，令其提出證明文件，如全部合格，則所餘油量全數供給醫生已嫌不足。故凡車主有特殊需要申請者，須在市府原有配量外之餘額中，再經審議小糾審査合格後，酌量配予。</p>
<p>又據趙局長吿記者：公用局爲解救汽油荒，刻正與台糖公司接洽，請其將高雄酒精運滬供應分配。因汽汕與酒精混合使用，尙須滲以化學品丁醉，現已商請中國石油公司大量生產。</p>

<h3>九龍奇蹟龍虱大飛行</h3>
<p>〔本報香港五日航訊〕記得兩週前，紐約上空發現由加拿大方面成羣結隊南飛的小黄鳥，在夜色黝黑中，紛紛向一千多尺高的帝國大厦摩天樓擅去，因撞樓而頓時失去了知覺的小黄鳥。如雨般落下街面，前後歷數小時之久，稱爲奇蹟。最近這兩三晚上，香港對岸的九龍半島，也出現了一個「大同小異〕的奇蹟。晨一時至四時之間，彌敦道，大埔道，窩打老道和亞皆老街等地，有盈千盈萬的「龍風」列隊飛過，「夜行客」和警察都目覩了這個怪現象。</p>
<p>〔龍風」是一祖入水能游，出水能飛的小昆虫，生於鄕村的陽原，形如常見的臭虫，大如茶匙，與桂花蟑同爲廣東人秋後的滋補零食。因此，這兩三個晚上，九龍方面便有不少店負或學徒之輩，拿了布袋或綫　之類去捉「龍風」炒熟來吃。</p>
<p>「龍風」離開陽原而飛行，從科學的觀點看，當有牠的理由，但九龍的市民硬說那是一種大災難的先兆。他們舉出，一九四一年八月間，九龍方面也發現了一次「龍風」大飛行，事後，九龍城的鄕村裏便發生了一次大瘟疫，斃人逾千，不及四個月，日軍攻入九龍，香港遭遇了百年來最大的苦難。事隔七八年，九龍居民又第二次見到了黑色的「龍風」結隊重來，他們惶惶然認爲什麽大災又要當頭，並且都在作一些無知的猜疑，</p>
<h3>希臘邊亂之國際背景（中）　（續七日本報）</h3>
<p>— 本報駐歐特約記者　辛風</p>
<p>目前希北邊境之情形，必須綜合歷史上希臘與阿保南三國之關係而加以觀察，當一九一二年巴爾幹戰爭期間及第一次大戰以後與一九一八年至一九三九年期間，希南邦交，維持友好。惟在同期内，希臘與阿保二國關係，因若干問題，而糾紛迭起。</p>
<p>希阿在一九一年至一九四八年間之紛爭原因極多。阿爾巴亞尼自一九一三年獨立後，阿國邊境直至一九二六年七月卅日始行解決，同時，希臘根據文化上及形勢上之理由，要求割據愛披羅北部Epurus，阿國非不同意，反則對希屬愛披羅南部，要求歸併阿國，此事在一九三九年至一九四一年間，因阿國受義大利法西斯政權之慫恿，要求尤切，自一九四〇年十一月以來，阿國在義大利對希宣戰以後，亦進兵入犯，占領希土。故希臘迄今認爲與阿爾巴尼亞，仍在戰爭狀態之中，而二國正常邦交關係，亦始終未復。卽於一九四七年二月十日與義大利簽訂和約時，對愛披羅北部問題，亦仍懸而未決。</p>
<p>在巴爾戰幹爭期間，（一九一二——一九一三），希臘與南斯拉夫之邦交，相處頗爲友好，且在第一次大戰期間，並肩作戰。一九三四年二月九日兩國且共同與羅馬尼亞及土耳其簽訂巴爾幹協約。該協約之議定書內，有一點頗司尋味，卽其規定以下情形爲侵略行為：</p>
<p>「支持其國境内武裝匪軍及該國境內匪軍侵略另一國領土，或拒絕該被侵略國之要求，以採取有力措置，以消除其境內匪軍之任何援助及保障」。</p>
<p>該兩國之邊境，於一九一三年八月十日波開來斯特Bucharest公約設定。在一九一七至一九四四年期間，尙無嚴重之邊境糾紛發生，惟此後希政府常因南斯拉夫在希南邊境各種藉口而感受不安。南希兩國之主要問題，厥爲南國欲在愛琴海之薩羅尼加，取得其經濟上之出路。此問題原先於一九二三年五月十日希南協約解決，在薩羅尼加成立南斯拉夫「自由區」，最後又於一九二九年三月十七日協約内，進一步規定該區較更寬之自由及便利，以及鐵路轉運方面之便利。</p>
<p>希保關係，在一九一二至一九四八年期間，糾紛甚多。保加利亞佔得色雷斯Phrace南部之後，繼欲染指馬其頓Macedonia。希臘在內戰期間，曾數次給保國在愛琴海方面經濟上之便利，而最後於一九二五年十月，在薩羅尼加成立希臘「自由區」。惟保國對此種便利，並未予以利用，蓋保國始終認爲欲達到其經濟上之出路，必須獲得該項領土。一九四一年四月，保參加第二次大戰，進軍於色雷斯西部，企岡奪取希屬西色雷斯。第二次大戰結束後，希臘要求向保國修正邊界，以維希臘沿保國邊境之安全，保國方面非但不同意，反要求割讓希屬西色雷斯之全部。希臘雖已於一九四七年二月十日與保國簽訂和約，但兩國正常邦交，至今尙未恢復。</p>
<p>希臘與巴爾幹各同盟國</p>
<p>一九四七年至一九四八年間希臘與其北鄰之關係，日趨惡化。東歐南歐在此時期內所締結之同盟制，對此問題，當有直接之影響。一九四六年七月九日阿南簽訂盟約時，發表宣言謂：「該盟約之簽訂，正値某方企岡發動另一戰爭之際，亦正値其侵犯傾向最顯明之時。」又謂：「正値希帝國及其策動者對阿南之侵犯，將危及巴爾幹及全世界和平之時</p>
<p>南保兩國於一九四七年十一月廿七日簽訂同樣盟約，其用意明示於兩方宣言中。在簽約時，兩國聯合宣言中，聲明不承認聯合國巴爾幹委員會，謂：「兩國代表一致認爲聯合國巴爾幹委員會之設立，係破壞聯合國精神及破壞五强一致同意之原則，以及危害巴爾幹各國之主權，因此兩國不能與該會合作，亦不許該會進入其國境。」</p>
<p>阿保兩國於一九四七年十二月六日亦簽訂同樣盟約，其聯合宣言中謂：</p>
<p>「關於與希臘重建邦交關係，兩政府認爲今日之希臘，已不復爲一獨立及主權完整之國家，因此無法進行復交……彼等代表保阿人民對希臘人民爲國家爭取自由，表示同情。」又謂：</p>
<p>「兩國代表認爲聯合國巴爾幹委員會之設立，係破壞聯合國之精神，及危害　爾幹各國之主權，因此三國不能准其進入國境。」</p>
<p>同時阿國首相霍克柴Enver　Hoxha將軍對新聞界公佈謂；</p>
<p>「吾國人民對希民之英勇掙扎，表示萬分同情。吾等將給予精神上及政治上最有力之支持，驚彼等在各方面，不但値得如是，且希民之自由解放，將奠定歐洲巴爾幹之和平及民主，世人均霑其益。」</p>
<p>保首相狄密脫勞夫Dmitrov於同時宣稱：</p>
<p>「吾等深信，霍克柴將軍必將同意共同支持希臘同胞及其民主軍隊，彼等之勝利爲巴爾幹和平及國際和平所必需者。」</p>
<p>保首相狄密脫勞夫又於一九四七年十二月卅一日新年廣播中謂</p>
<p>「希臘法西斯帝國在吾國邊境挑釁糾紛，並派人至吾國從事恐怖及密探工作。保國人民深愛永久和平，故決心積極工作，以保衛其獨立，並願爲巴爾幹民主及和平之堅實而有力之一員。希氏爲自由獨立之英勇掙扎，必予力助，蓋彼南鄰爲爭取正義而掙扎，對樹立巴爾幹各國友好邦交，誠有極賽貴之貢獻也。」</p>
<p>希保和約，雖已於一九四七年十一月十九日簽訂，但希方欲與保國恢復邦交之企圖，歷次遭遇保政府各項要求，如撤回希軍聯絡員，枸捕大批希臘人士等。</p>
<p>希臘與其北鄰之關係，希代表於一九四七年十二月二日向巴爾幹委員會報告，大意謂：</p>
<p>「希政府始終一本憲章精神及聯合國大會之決議，以和平方式，謀解決其與北鄰之紛爭，希政府並極端希望，力謀與其北鄰三國建立正常邦交關係，惟希政府要求對方給予同樣之熱誠及善意。希政府對希南二國過去二年中之邦交關係，未能如往昔之開誠相處，引爲遺憾，惟希政府堅信，希南兩國不但曾一度爲盟友，且曾並肩作戰，必能互相尊重，以重建合作之道。關於保加利亞，希臘在三十年，曾爲其遭受三次苦難，而其在第二次大戰中，佔領希土，使希遭遇莫大之損失及破壞。希政府已與其簽訂和約，並已準備與其重建邦交，與阿爾巴尼亞。吾國亦極願從速重建正常邦交，自一九四〇年以來，希阿兩國始終在戰爭狀態之中。吾等深盼兩國懸案，能早日解決，而友好邦交，早日重建」云云。（待續）</p>

<h3>進口貨征稅標準</h3>
<p>貿易促進會呈請糾正</p>
<p>自財政經濟緊急處分令頒布以來，全國物價均已遵照政府法令，按八月十九日成交價凍結，惟海關對各項進口貨物所徵關稅，迄今仍或按國外價加百分之五，或照市價估計作爲課稅標準，致使進口貨成本增高。爲此一般廠商對於訂購國外原料，咸具戒心，不特使進口商業務蒙受重大打擊，原料供求，亦受影響。本市國際貿易促進會，有鑒於此，頃特具呈經濟管制督導員辦公處，請求予以糾正。</p>
<h3>橡膠原料飛揚製品無貨應市</h3>
<p>零售商紛入公會冀獲配貨</p>
<p>橡膠廠商最近遭受『搶購」之影響，損失頗爲重大。如大中華正泰等大型橡膠廠，因生橡膠黑市價比限價漲起一倍，其他原料亦莫不飛揚，造成生產成本激增之結果，乃將配貨日期予以愆遲，作消極抵制。小型廠商則託詞代製軍鞋，無貨供應，藉以避免損失，以致經營橡膠之商人，惟恐存貨售罄後，不易添補，存底益見枯涸。所有長統靴，特製球鞋，大平靴等，市上乃均吿絕跡。祗有平口套鞋及低檔膠鞋應市，各地販戶仍不乏前來搜購。至於橡膠公會停市已久，日前曾有元元拉鍊鞋配銷各會員，計分甲乙丙三級，甲級配一打，乙級配九雙，丙級配六雙，每打配價廿六元三角九分，共計配出二百餘打之多。一般未入會之零銷商，因不願放棄承配權利，紛紛申請入會，致一日間登記入會，達一百餘單位，而繼續申請入會者仍源源不絕云。</p>

<h3>收購國棉兩大問題　搶購戰區原棉及搶運陝棉</h3>
<p>本年國棉收購工作，自經當局決定，由國家行局會同廠商合組聯合收購處後，日來各方對此工作，均在加緊進行中。聯合徵信所記者，爲明瞭本年國棉產量及其收購數量，昨晨特走訪某棉業鉅子。據彼估計，本年全國棉產量，約在八百至九百萬司馬擔，惟大部產區，均爲戰火瀰漫，故實收數量，勢將打一極大折扣，而陜西等地產棉區域，雖尙稱安定，但亦因交通工具之限制，無法外運，故彼認爲當局除配合廠商合組聯購處外，對如何搶購戰區棉花，如何便利原棉運輸等問題，亦應及時設法，然後收購工作，始可望其收效。</p>
<p>彼並指出，目前堆　於陜境存棉，數量極豐，約在卅萬擔左右，然因交通困難，均無法外運，而各地紡織工廠，則因原料缺乏，除上海一地尙勉强維持外，其餘各區，莫不已頻半停頓狀態。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕國棉聯購委會自決定全面聯購國棉後，全國設分處分站地點之負責人，爲近便計，聞將暫時調用紡建公司各分處負責人先行兼代。現各處負責人，業已分途來滬，將俟聯購會主委劉攻芸返滬後，再舉行會議，共商推進聯購辦法云。</p>
<p>又訊：中國國貨聯營公司負責人王性堯，昨晨至國行晋謁劉副總裁攻芸，據云：目前紗布外銷，因匯率提高後已漸見起色，惟因出口限制，故仍難擴展，現擬請求國行對運銷荷印之紗布出口貿易，改交該業鎧，現荷印之紗布進口，亦由該地之進口商負責，如能交由該業辦理，出口貿易卽可因而擴大。</p>
<p>棉布市塲亦繼續停業，前日舫建開售之十三種布疋，經核准配售者，共計准購單一千一百七十六張，售布三萬九千七百十疋，零頭布四千五百磅，其中廠家六六張，得配五千六百七十疋，布號一千一百十張，得配三萬四千零四十疋，零頭布四千五百磅，價値八十八萬三千九百五十一金圓，所供之各布，均爲挨號以門市居多，批發行號較少。</p>
<p>又訊；棉布公會原定供售民營染廠布疋，刻已售罄，須稍緩時日，約尙有六萬餘疋，可能絡續供書。</p>
<h3>輸管會賡續配絲促進絲織品外銷</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕據輸管會息，我國生絲因成本高昂。加以人造絲與日絲之競爭，以致外銷困難。該會有鑒於此，前經決定配售生絲原料與各絲廠，協助其加工製織綢疋外銷，估計此項製成品輸出廠商轉可獲利。近來各廠商之來會申請核配者，殊爲踴躍。本市各大織綢廠如美亞新昌大豐壬豐上海絲織產銷聯營公司等，均在其列。第一次配售者，爲Ｃ級Ｄ級生絲，總額二百担，截至目前止，行將配罄，共計可獲美金十四萬元。該會爲繼續减輕廠商之產製成本，促進綢疋增產，及爭取外匯起見，頃已商得國行同意，增撥二百祖，照原配價（Ｄ級每磅美金三元五角）賡續辦理。對於今後國產綢疋之出口，必更能蓬勃開展云。</p>

<p>主席致詞　吳鐵城主席致詞：謂亞洲人口佔世界人口之半，在國際佔重要地位。於去年四月新德里泛亞會議時，即決定成立本會宗旨在促進亞洲各地人民相互間了解與合作，對和平繁榮有貢獻。明年須由我國召集開會。</p>
<p>胡適講演　繼由胡適致詞，謂去年新德里開會有廿八個國家與會，我國有杭立武次長等出席，明年開會，我國須作主人，故積極組成此會。本人當大學敎授潸一年，任大學校長兩年，就敎育立塲言，對中國亞洲關係協會貢獻二項意見：（一）中國爲世界大國，五强之一，在亞洲爲最老大國家，而全國大學，對亞洲各國，如暹，緬，印度，安南，朝鮮之文字語言歷史，未曾設有科系硏究，以謀溝通，增進了解。以印度論，據調査人口確數，有四萬萬人，語言文化未通，殊爲遺憾。北大自成立東方語文學系硏究印度梵文以來，回敎已資送學生入學。希望政府重視此事，因促進亞洲國家之合作了解，必須爲東方語言文字歷史培育人才。（二）二次世界大戰以後，帝國主義被打倒，民族得解放生存目立，我僑胞在外，以勞苦血汗所得謀生活，往往遭誤解，忍辱受苦。欲救其弊，惟有從增進亞洲各國民族間的了解辦法，最爲澈底，可以改着。故本人認爲本會非國際間外交應酬門面之事，乃關係亞洲各國，因此可以增進了解，爲和平繁榮之基石。繼由社會部代表曹司長沛滋，敎部次杭長立武報吿籌備經過，並通過會章。</p>

<p>昨賽兩隊俱以全力相搏，聖約翰球藝連絡，俱勝一籌，本可輕易取勝。但因劈殺手翁誠光突患腹瀉，勉力上陣支撑，彭仲權傷寒症後又未全部復原，影響戰鬥力不少。幸永一追成各一平手後，翁誠光扶病再出，始於頽勢下搶回第三局，奠定勝利之基。</p>

<p>第二局翁誠光漸感不支，吳心芸趕到補上。永一反攻，着着佔先，約翰緊隨不捨，永一奮力作戰。終以廿一比十九扳成和局。</p>
<p>第三局永一秉乘餘威，一度以十比五佔先，但約翰因翁誠光復出，將士用命，錢家祥之巧吊，孫　强之快壓，輔以劉永强，翁誠光之劈殺，連追六分，後防吳心芸，葉慶强，董爲濤又拼命撲救，竟以廿二比二十後來居上，二度領先。</p>
<p>最後一局，約翰更賈餘勇，始終遙遙前領，永一掙扎無效，遂以十五比廿一敗陣，屈居亞軍，兩隊陣容如下：</p>

<h3>祝十科學團體聯合年會成功</h3>
<p>中華自然科學社，中國科學社曁中國天文·數學·物理·地球物理·地理·氣象·動物。遺傳學會等十科學團體聯合年命，定今日在京舉行，本報爲提倡學術硏究起見，爰將各團體概况作一簡單之介紹，惟爲篇幅所限，容有罣漏，尙希讀者諸君諒之。</p>
<h3>走向科學時代</h3>
<p>— 盧于道</p>
<p>在九月裏有北平研究院的學術會議及中央研究院的院士會議；接着在十月裏，全國各地有各種科學團體聯合年會。這兩個月來，科學學術的空氣大有瀰漫全國之勢。古老衰微的祖國，在目前政治經濟氣壓極低之下，我們呼吸着這種科學的空氣，或者會使我們頭腦淸醒一下，從簇新的科學觀點，試考慮究竟我們爲了國運，如何走向新的科學時代？</p>
<p>從科學觀點看起來，我們有兩點實在不能容許，第一點是保守的封建思想，第二點是散漫凌亂的事業。</p>
<p>先就思想而言。科學思想的最大特徵，莫過於不斷求進步，所謂日日新又日新。我們要進步，要後來居上，絕對不能封建保守。這種思想，由進化論一闡發得最爲透澈，任何科學部門亦都證實了這一點。</p>
<p>似乎每個人都有一點懷古的情緒，有如我們到了金陵古城，每個人不免要懷念古蹟那樣。這種文人雅興，亦未可厚非；可是「溫故」目的在乎「知新」，懷古目的就在乎增强改進古老祖國的情緒，這才是正當的出路。如果因懷古而拘泥於古，甚至於鄙視新的，結果是害了祖國，將祖國推向墳墓，這和科學精神絕對相反。在科學領域內，今天相對論改進了牛頓力學，我們就很勇敢地揚棄了牛頓力學而用相對論力學；今天原子知識否定了道爾頓原子學說，我們亦就很勇敢地不再固執道爾頓原子學說，積極地加緊追究原子內部的構造；甚至於新的量子思想，質讓波動想法，時定一體和物質能力一體想法，爲我們一般人想像不到的想法，祗要這種想法是合乎眞理，我們全體人類可以從新學習。這是科學精神；這種精神，和追念先王，誣咒今日人心不古一味固執泥古者，絕對不容。</p>
<p>這是思想方面。</p>
<p>其次現在科學的又一個特徵，爲組織，合作和計劃，絕不能散漫凌亂因循敷衍；尤其是原子研究開展之後，科學界已將集團工作Teamwork的重要性充分提高。現在個人英雄天才時代，至少在科學界業已成爲過去的陳跡；今後爲集體時代。如果將人類分成兩種動物，一種是個人活動的動物，又一種是具體活動的動物，則我們已經可以看到不久的將來，集體活動的人類之視個人活動的人類，有如人的視猩猩猴一個更高等一個是落後，近來科學家作研究工作，卽小至於一個實驗室，硏究一個問題，寫一篇論文，亦是由數，理，化各門專家合作，而不是各行其是。這種敎訓，如果普及到政治社會，這就是眞正的科學時代的開始。</p>
<p>時代走向科學；我們自己的思想，行動亦必須澈底從新改造，創造新的時代，新的國運。亦許今天科學團體的聯合年會，就是一個開始，</p>
<h3>中華自然科學社概況</h3>
<p>中華自然科學社成立於民國十六年至今已有二十一年的歷史，我們立社的目標，簡括設來，約有四項：卽（一）爲謀科學之普及，以啓民智；（二）爲作科學之發展，以裕民生；（三）爲求科學之調査，以固國本；（四）爲行科學之研究，以禺文化，經二十多年的努力，本社已有社員二千餘人，總社設在南京（地址中央大學内），在國内和國外的重要都市多設分社。現任理事畏爲吳有訓，總幹事沈其益。</p>
<p>本社近年來所進行的工作，約有下列六項；</p>
<p>（一）科學世界　刊　創刊於民國二十年，現在已出十七卷，是我國普及科學知識發行最早的綜合性期刊。在抗戰艱苦的時期，本刊一直維持在內地出版，不曾間斷。復員後移上海出版。對於近代科學知識的進展，更加以系統的介紹已出「原子核」「航空」兩專號。雙十節爲紀念科學團體聯合年會將出刊「雷達」專號</p>
<p>（二）中國科學與建設（Scincend　Technology　in　Chma）英文雙月刊在我國抗戰的時期，後方和海外的交通阻斷，我國的科學刊物也多數停頓。本社感於國內外科學交流不容中斷，就與英國文化委員會合作由本社編輯中國科學（Acta　Brevia　Sinenssa）報導我國科學的進步由英國文化委員會寄英在倫敦出版，分贈英美科學界。此項工作直到戰爭結束才終止。復員後，我們認爲我國科學與建設事業的進展，有向海外繼續報導的需要，因此從今年一月起創刊中國科學與建設英月雙月刊已出版五期。（三）刋行「科學文彙」（Scien　eAbstracts　and　Articles　fcommicrofilm）在抗戰的後期我國與沿海爲日寇所侵佔，國外科學書刋，不能寄遞國内，英美兩國政府曾贈與我國科學圖書影片　，但是此種影片，閱讀甚感困難，本社爲解決此種困難，曾將圖書影片中重要文獻用打字翻印編行「科學文彙」，計分「物理」　「生物」及「工程」三學科，供後方科學界的參考，以加强我國抗戰的力量。此項工作在勝利後卽行結束。</p>
<p>報導科學新聞　在科學進步日新月異的今日時代，人民對於科學進步的認識，實屬必要，藉報章報導科學新聞是最有效的辦法，復員後我們就和中央社合作，開始這項工作，在報章繼續報導科學新聞已有二年各地報章極多刊載，成效很顯著。</p>
<p>（五）在各地主辦科學演講我們爲廣播科學知識由分佈在全國各地的分社經常主辦科學講演，映放科學電影出版科學副刊以謀科學知識的普及</p>
<p>（六）舉辦科學考察團　在抗戰期中，後方資源調査，對於支持抗戰有密切的關係。本社在民國廿九年曾組織科學考察團赴西康，調査農林工鑛等資源三十一年又曾組織西北科學考察團赴甘寗靑一帶考察均已草成考察報吿，送各方參考。</p>
<h3>中國遺傳學會概況</h3>
<p>中國還傳學會成立於民國三十三年十一月，在抗戰期間，東南學府及學術機關多遷移後方。三十三年中國科學社在成都開七科學團體聯合年會。蓉渝各學術機關及各大學從事遺傳學敎學及研究者當時遂聯合各學者乘七科學團體聯合年會之際，組織宣吿中國遺傳學會成立。現本會有會員百餘人，</p>
<h3>中國物理學會概況</h3>
<p>中國物理學會是我國物理學者結合的一個學術團體。他已經有了十七年的歷史。</p>
<p>中國物理學會的章程上所載的宗旨只是簡潔的一句話「本會以謀物理學之進步及其普及爲宗旨」，所以會務的發展也針對着這個目標做去，目前屬於理事會的有四個委員會（一）學報委員會。負責中國物理學報的編輯和印刷，這學報的性質是專載國人對物理學的研究論文，抗戰前出了四卷，抗戰中暫時停頓了若干時，三十三年復刊，到現在又出了三卷，每卷兩册到四册不等。這學報流傳在國外，其論文常爲人所稱引。英國每月一册的科學論文摘要（Scionce　Abstract）也採集這學報所刊論文做材料。（二）名詞審査委員會。受敎育部的委託，對物理學名詞的轉譯加以審定，已審定而交編譯館發表的有一千多條，已審定尙待刊印的也有千餘條。（三）敎學委員會。討論中國大中學中物理學之敎學問題，本屆年會中，就要邀請京市各中學的物理敎師到會討論中學物理學敎學的問題。（四）應用物理學彙刊委員會。負普編印以中文寫述物理學在應用上之功用，這是一種不定期刊物，讀者的對象是國內的中學大學生及一般對物理學有興趣的人士，這與第一項所述的中國物理學報的專門著作相輔而行達成本會普及物理學及謀其進步之目的。</p>
<p>會中的工作除此之外，每年集大會一次，會中宣讀論文，討論會務，抗戰前每年集全國會員於一地，開過這樣盛大的年會五次，地點在北平者二次，上海，靑島，南京各一次，抗戰以後，以交通不便，集會不易，乃採分區開年會的辦法每年於同一時期在重慶，昆明，成都，湄潭，桂林等地分別舉行，勝利後，尙採用這分區的辦法。今年我們在這裏參加十科學團體開年會的，只是限於京滬杭區的會員，其他同時舉行區年會的有北平，西安等地，集會的方式除一年一度的年會外，尙有定期的小組討論會及不定期演講會，上海分會對此兩項工作格外熱心。</p>
<p>中國物理學會又代表我国物理學界參加了好幾次的世界物理學會，這一次世界物理學會在荷蘭開翁，我們更曾派遣代表出席。</p>
<p>現在中國物理學會有三個分會，北平，上海和西安，全體會員五百六十人，國外的名譽會員九人，包括東方的印度物理學家拉曼，團體會員十八單位，現在的理事長爲嚴濟慈，副理事長饒毓泰，書記周培源，會計施汝爲</p>
<h3>中國天文學會概況</h3>
<p>中國天文學會以求天文學之進步及普及爲宗旨，倡議於民國初年，當時因問津天學者尠，遂暫置形式組織，先用天文學會名義，刊行月刊，藉以號召同志。逮十一年十月三十日，始正式成立，至今凡二十六年，共計舉行年會二十二次，會負總數凡688人。茲就其舉辦之事業簡述於次。</p>
<p>（一）編譯天文圖書　民國初年籌備時代，先刊行定期刊物一種，定名觀象叢報，月出一册，四年七月第一　第一期出版，至十年十月，刊行至第七卷第三期時，因印費竭蹶而停刊。十二年七月復刊，改稱爲觀象彙刊，未幾又停，改刊年報，名曰中國天文學會會報，第一期於十三年出版。迨刊至第八期後，改爲不定期刊物。現已出至第九期。十九年七月恢復月刊，更名爲宇宙，迄今未輟，現已出至第十八卷第六號。目前會報與月刊並行出版二者性質微有不同；會報以刊載本會會員硏究論文爲主，間亦刊載衙要譯著；月刊以刊布通俗天文著述爲主，論載宇宙天界消息。此外尙有繁星觀測報吿，由變星觀測委員會刊佈。又有會員通訊一種，每半年一期，專刊學會消息，</p>
<p>（二）編訂天文名詞　十九年十二月成立天文名詞編闔委員會，以會負張鈺哲主其事，二十二年將名詞一千四百餘則送國立編譯館刋布。二十六年年會決議函請國立編譯館重訂犬文學名詞，由會員陳遵嬀負其責，旋得名詞六千一百餘則，送由國立編譯館油印分送犬文名詞編譯委員會各委員加以審査。三十一年十月三十一日舉行天文名詞討論會，決定名詞取捨標準，並通過各名詞之譯名。三十六年由國立編譯館聘幹事一人協助陳君整理，現大槪薪火相傳已就緒，惟尙有若干問題須經此次年會作最後之審定後，始能確定。預期今年內可以付梓、</p>
<p>（三）觀測雙足　十四年第三屆年會時，決議設立變星觀測委員會。旋因種種困難，荏苒數年，迄未成立。迨十八年第七屈年會時，會員張雲又提出本案，始經大會決議，卽行成立。委員會暫設於廣州國立中山大學天文臺内。委員散居各地，惟以在廣州者爲多數。在廣州市之委員，卽借用國立中山大學天文臺之遠鏡觀測；在其他各地之委員，或借用當地天文臺之遠鏡，或自備　單筒遠鏡觀測，觀測結果，統寄委員會發表。委員會每兩月刊行觀測報吿一次。每兩年復彙集觀測結果，刊行年報一册。報告並按期郵政海外與國際學術團體交換。</p>
<p>（四）聯絡硏究凡一科學術之促進，必需相與觀摩以資鼓舞，量力互助以增效率，庶幾集合意見得成系統。中國天文學會亦本斯旨與各方聯絡硏究，例如國內各天文機關均爲團體會員；二十三年發起籌備日食觀測·二十五年及三十年之日食，均組隊觀測。至於我國天文學界與國際天文學界之聯絡交際，亦盡棉力。例如國際天文協會第二，三，五等屆大會均派會員出席；第四次太平洋科學會議天文組，亦經派員參加。</p>
<p>（五）學術講演會　所在北平時，每月皆有學術講演，行之數年，未嘗中輟。會所南遷後，演講停止，然每年年會或相當時機，仍有舉行。</p>
<p>（六）獎勵天學著述　設立隱名獎金及淡園獎金各一種，獎勵天學著作，隱名獎金已於十六年及二十二年各贈授一次。淡園獎金之第一目的在補助中國出席國際天文協會者之旅費；倘政府已正式派員出席，則此項獎勵金，移供獎勵研究中國古代天文之著作，故至今尙未贈</p>
<h3>中國科學社概況</h3>
<p>中國科學社，發起於美國之綺色佳城，時方民國三年，初名「科學社」卽發行，科學雜誌，迄今達三十卷。四年，正式成立，名稱上冠「中國」二字上英文名：Sciende　Soctety　of　Chima”以「聯絡同志，研究學術，共圖中國科學之發達」爲宗旨，以「格物啓知，利用厚生」，爲社銘。六年，呈准敎育部立案。九年，設科學圖書館於南京賢賢街文德里社所。十一年，又就京社創生物硏究所，十八年，創中國科學圖書儀器公司於上海莫爾鳴路，後遷中正中路，至今爲上海鉛印業之領袖。二十年，上海陝西南路社所明復圖書館落成，悉以藏書充棟。未幾、南京生物研究所新厦亦竣。二十二年，創刊科學畫報，迄今已達十四卷。二十六年寇躪東南，總社西遷四川北碚；流離顚沛，奮勵無前，生物研究，不絕如縷，科學雜誌，繼續發行，並曾舉行年會三次。上海社所賴上海社友曁留社職工苦心掩護得以無恙，岡書館照常開覽，科學畫報從未誤期，上海社友會尤精誠團結，新膽共嘗。南京社所則付諸一炬，爲國犧牲。三十四年，呈准社會部立案。戰後次第復員獨生物研究所因京社地基，被宵小强佔，棲滯上海社所。三十六年，添設射電實騐所，同年，舉行勝利後首屆年會於上海，參加者七科學團體，科學社議決易英文譯名爲「CHinese　Association　for　TleAdvasment　of　Science」簡稱「C.A.A.S」。今年第二十六屆年會，分六區舉行，京滬杭區聯合十科學團體，華北區聯合八科學團體，華中區聯合五科學團體，各各聯合舉行，其餘華西，西南，華南各區，亦積極措辦焉。現有事業計：總辦事處，編輯部，明復圖書館，生物硏究听，科學畫報部，射電實騐所，並中國科學公司而爲七單位，有社員三千餘人。</p>

<h3>中國地球物理學會概況</h3>
<p>地球物理學爲硏究地球海陸空三界物理現象及其應用之科學，國内工作人員爲謀斯學之進步及普及起見，於三十六年春發起組織中國地球物理學會，於同年八月正式成立，並呈准政府立案。</p>
<p>本會現有會員五十四人，理事長爲陳宗器，並刊行中國地球物理學報一種，年出兩期，第一卷第一期業已出版，該刊依照各國專門學報慣例，用英，德，法三種文字之任何一種發表。</p>
<h3>中國地理研究和中國地理學會</h3>
<p>— 張其昀</p>
<p>中國地理學會是一個全國性的組織，於民國二十三年創立於首都，同年夏季於江西廬山舉行首屆年會，同時創刊學報，登載有精深硏究的論著。抗戰發生本會隨政府西遷重慶，歷年學報迄未中輟。去年年會在上海召開，本屆回到首都來集會，還是戰後第一次。當國家艱難締造之初，正學人努力貢獻之時。本會同人都懷着自省自勉和積極進取的精神來赴會。</p>
<p>現代學術崇尙專精，分工愈趨細密，收獲愈是豐盛。本會成立在東北事變以後，卽此短短十幾年中，經多數專家實地考察，殫精研究，我國地理學的園地中，凡自然地理，生物地理，人文地　，歷史地理，地理教育諸部門，都顯有好多燦爛之花，美滿之果。不但本行以外的人，往往不盡注意，便是自家的同志，也未見得都能充分明瞭。最近經任美鍔徐匠之兩位敎授，把這一時期的新收穫，分別寫成長篇報吿，先後在科學雜誌（第三十卷第四期）和地理學報（第十四卷第三四期）發表。固然他們所介紹只是些代表性的作品，並非全豹，可是我們讀了以後彷彿看見江流壯闊，帆檣成林，着實令人興奮無已。本屆年會同志們提出的論文，相信一定比往年更有精采。羣策羣力，互相觀摩，共圖斯學的進步，學會主要的意義在此。</p>
<p>讀觀世界各國之地理學會大致可以分爲四類。以美國而言，美國地理學家協會，華府國民地理學會，及美國地理敎師學會四個團體，可作例證。美國地理學家協會，成立於一九〇四年，是一種同業公會，會員大都是在大學任敎或在硏究機關工作的專家，年出會誌四冊，篇數不多，而水凖極高，所載每年一任的新會長就職致辭，高瞻遠矚，彰往察來，指示出治學的方針。年會的論文，亦皆有摘要刊出，誠哉可謂文獻淵藪，紐約地理學會成立於一八五二年，資格最老，會員範圍較寬，不以專家爲限。該會有宏敞的會所，完善的圖書館，專任的職員，和極有遠見的編輯計畫，其所刊行的地理學論評季刊，乃世界第一流的論壇，執筆者均係世界各國的權威學者，其論文大多爲專題硏究，富於參考價値。羣府政府機關各部門以此誌爲必　之書，於解決内政外交匯濟國防諸大問題，深獲裨益。此外該會又出版叢書與地岡，貢獻宏多。華府國民地理學會出版的國民地理雜誌，是圖文並茂的月刊，自一八九九年創刊以來，久已深入民間，每期銷行一百多萬份，眞是家絃戶誦的精神食糧。其彩色圖版的豐美，舉世無匹，實爲全世界最大的敎育性雜誌。該會因營榮發達，經濟充裕，財力足以舉辦大規模的探險，諸如北極的發見，冰河的考察，深海的勘測，同溫層的探討，在科學上都是饒有貢獻。至於美國地理敎師協會，顧名思議，與學校敎科有關，其所出地理雜誌，每月一册，内容深入淺出，凡敎材敎法圖書設備的討論，都是日新又新，期達促進中小學地理教學之目的。</p>
<p>中國地理學會成立之初，會長翁文　，理事竺可楨各位先生，確抱有一番宏願。我們想以首都爲據點，集合全國同志的心力，來發揚中國的地理學，俾與歐美諸國地理學會同流並進。曾擬籌募基金，建築會所，徵集圖書，以利會務之推進。而抗戰發生，十載流離，格於環境，難如初願。只問耕種，不問收穫，原是學人應持的態度。深信果能認眞工作，集中貢獻，久而久之，不難獲得社會的賞識與同情。由於政府的獎勵和廣大民間的贊助，定能使當年一幅遠景漸臻實况。就目前言，本會的性質與美國地理學家協會相似。無論將來會務如何發展，論文的宣讀，學報的編輯，終究是一個學會的基本任務。而年會的舉行是檢討會務交換識見的樞機所在，關係至爲重要。</p>
<p>中國地理學會現在的通訊處是南京中央大學地理系轉，現任理事長胡煥庸，總幹事任美　。</p>

<h3>The President Flew from Beiping to Shanghai, and Visited the City at Night with His Wife</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] President Chiang departed from Beiping by special plane "Zhongmei" at 2 PM yesterday, arriving at Longhua Airport in this city at 5:45 PM in the afternoon. Director Yu Jishi, Secretary Cao Shengfen, and others accompanied him. Those who went to the airport to greet him included Madam Chiang, Mayor Wu, Commander Xuan, and Director Yu, among others. The giant Zhongmei plane landed safely in the dim twilight. President Chiang, wearing a black cloak and a gray felt hat, descended from the plane in good spirits despite the long flight. After shaking hands with those welcoming him as a greeting, he went with his wife by car to the official residence on Leping Road to rest. Mayor Wu, Commander Xuan, and Director Yu accompanied him to inquire about the President's well-being before departing. It is understood that the President's visit to Shanghai is purely a stopover, and he will return to Nanjing before National Day. The rumor that he came to Shanghai to deal with the issue of commodity prices is also speculative. The President is indeed very concerned about the issue of commodity prices, but price controls are now being handled by the Executive Yuan as a whole.</p>
<p>[Report from the Central News Agency] After arriving in Shanghai, President Chiang, accompanied by his wife, toured the city by car at 8 PM last night, starting from Donglai Road, Huashan Road, Nanjing Road, and beyond.</p>
<p>[Report from the Central News Agency, Beiping, 8th] President Chiang left Beiping by plane for Shanghai at about 2 PM on the 8th, accompanied by Director Yu Jishi and Secretary Cao Shengfen. Commander-in-Chief Fu Zuoyi, Chairman Chu Xichun, Commander-in-Chief Chen Jicheng, Mayor Liu Yaozhang, and others all went to the airport to see him off. The President flew from Nanjing to Beiping on the 30th of last month, and his visit to Tianjin, Shenyang, and other places on the 9th greatly encouraged the military and civilians in the North.</p>
<h3>The Five Provinces and Cities Economic Management Conference Opens a Group Meeting; Measures for the Supply and Demand of Important Materials in the Shanghai Area Are Determined; Prices in the Consumer Market Are Comprehensively and Rationally Adjusted</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper, Nanjing, 8th] The group meeting of the Three Provinces and Two Cities Economic Control Conference was held on the morning of the 8th to review the conference topics and discuss measures to regulate the supply and demand of important materials in this region, chaired by Li Lixia. Attendees included Zhang Zongliang, Director of the Anhui Construction Department, Gong Peicheng, Director of the Zhejiang Construction Department, Qian Zhenrong, Director of the Jiangsu Construction Department, and Xie Zhengfu, Director of the Nanjing Social Affairs Bureau. Five concrete measures have been decided and will be implemented after being approved by Yu Hongjun and Chiang Ching-kuo. The focus of these measures is to invigorate the circulation of materials to regulate supply and demand. The past Shanghai method of prohibiting the outflow of materials will be revised in a timely manner. These measures have been carried back to Shanghai by Li Lixia on the express train at 6 PM in the afternoon for approval by the Economic Supervision Office.</p>
<p>The main points of the measures are recorded as follows: (1) The materials of the three provinces and two cities within this region should circulate among each other as much as possible, and priority should be given to supply. For example, Shanghai should give priority to supplying the consumption of manufactured goods within this region, and the three provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui should give priority to supplying the raw materials needed within this region; (2) In terms of prices, the prices of materials in the producing areas should be strictly controlled so that they do not exceed the price limits of August 19th, and the prices in the consumer markets should be rationally adjusted in their entirety based on costs; (3) The government, in conjunction with merchants, will jointly purchase important daily necessities for the people within this region from the producing areas, distribute and supply them, and gradually implement a rationing system for important goods; (4) In response to the panic buying trend, local governments should limit the quantity of various important materials that people can purchase each year to eliminate the abnormal panic buying mentality; (5) Domestically produced consumables and luxury goods will not be controlled and can be purchased freely.</p>
<h3>Chiang Ching-kuo Passes Through Wuxi from Nanjing to Preside Over an Economic Management Forum, Delivering a Sincere Speech to Ensure That the Exchange of Goods Does Not Suffer Shortages</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper, Wuxi, 8th] Chiang Ching-kuo arrived in Wuxi from Nanjing on the morning of the 8th and went directly to the command post, where Commander Liu reported on the situation of assisting in stabilizing prices. He then went to the county government for inspection, where County Magistrate Zhou reported on the management of materials. At 2 PM in the afternoon, he presided over an economic control forum, listening to reports from merchants. Attendees included Lin Chongyong, heads of various agencies in this county, chairmen of various trade associations, managers of various national banks, presidents of various newspapers, and the heads and speakers of eleven counties including Wuxi, Wu, Zhen, Kun, Danyu, Cheng, and Yi. After Commander Liu delivered an introductory speech, Chiang stood up and delivered a sincere speech, saying that he hoped that all industries would abide by government laws and regulations, safeguard the currency system reform plan, and make the people believe in the Gold Yuan notes because the government's reserves were very sufficient. He then stated: (1) The increased tax on tobacco and alcohol this time can balance the government's revenue and expenditure, which is directly beneficial to the people; (2) Increase production, and the supply department will not create high or low price differences; (3) Crack down on black markets and speculative markets. Regarding price controls, they should be fully implemented, and individual actions that create dead markets will not be allowed. It is necessary to ensure the exchange of goods and prevent shortages. In the future, merchants will be responsible for procuring goods through trade associations, and the government will provide assistance as much as possible. He also said that the government does not oppose merchants making money, but opposes profiteering. Subsequently, representatives from various industries presented the current difficulties one by one. Finally, Chiang gave detailed instructions and stated that the price limit for rice in Wuxi would not be limited in time. After the meeting adjourned at 4 PM, he summoned the heads of various counties to talk, listened to the situation in various places, and instructed on methods for the supply and demand of materials, and attention should be paid to rice, wheat, etc.: (1) Are there any large households in the countryside hoarding goods? (2) Deliberate on the local situation and seek reasonable adjustments. After the meeting, he visited Shenxin and other factories and returned to Shanghai by car at 7 PM that evening. In addition, the Shanghai market strictly prohibits newspapers from leaving the country. The Wuxi Newspaper Association requested Chiang Ching-kuo for assistance. (News of Chiang Ching-kuo's return to Shanghai is published on the fourth page.)</p>
<h3>Wang Yunwu Will Arrive in Shanghai Tomorrow</h3>

<h3>Chen Ce Cables President Chiang</h3>
<p>Regarding the Request to Thoroughly Investigate the Purchase of Hong Kong Currency in Guangdong, He Said That Someone Falsely Used His Name to Send a Telegram</p>
<p>[Report from our newspaper, Guangzhou, 7th] National Assembly Representative General Chen Ce recently stated that the Guangdong-Guangzhou National Assembly Friendship Association's telegram to the central government requesting the dispatch of personnel to Guangdong Province to investigate the purchase of Hong Kong dollars by Guangdong banks was clearly someone falsely using his name to send a telegram. He sent a special telegram to the President and the heads of various central government departments and commissions to clarify the matter. The original telegram stated: "At a certain regular meeting of the Friendship Association, someone proposed discussing the purchase of Hong Kong currency by Guangdong banks to buy Siamese rice before the currency reform. It was unanimously agreed that Chairman Song had already telegraphed the central government to send personnel to thoroughly investigate, and this Association also agreed to this action and telegraphed the central government to send personnel to Guangdong to investigate in order to clarify the truth. At that time, Ce was the chairman, and he immediately followed this resolution, but the telegram was not sent."</p>

<h3>Measures for Using the Storage Capital of Commercial Banks Are Announced</h3>
<p>[Report from the Central News Agency, Nanjing, 8th] The measures for adjusting the capital of commercial banks stipulate that the cash portion of the increased capital should be stored in the Central Bank or its entrusted bank within three months. If there is a legitimate use, it can only be used after approval by the competent authority of the Ministry of Finance. It is learned that the measures for this use have been drafted by the Ministry of Finance and submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval and will be announced and implemented on the 8th. The measures are as follows:</p>
<p>Article 1 These measures are formulated in accordance with the provisions of Article 5, Paragraph 2 of the Measures for Adjusting the Capital of Commercial Banks.</p>
<p>Article 2 When a commercial bank intends to use the cash capital increase funds deposited in the Central Bank (or its entrusted bank) within three months, it must state the reason and apply to the local Central Bank (or its entrusted bank) for approval.</p>
<p>Article 3 The approved use of the deposited capital is limited to the following purposes: (1) Purchasing government bonds (short-term treasury bills are not included); (2) Investing in public transportation undertakings; (3) Investing in agricultural, industrial, and mining production undertakings; (4) If a bank has insufficient working capital, it must use the deposited capital to offset exchange differences, but it must replenish it on the next day, with a total of ten times; (5) Other legitimate uses approved by the Ministry of Finance on a case-by-case basis.</p>
<p>Article 4 After the Central Bank (or its entrusted bank) approves a commercial bank to use the deposited capital, it shall report the reason and amount of the approval to the Ministry of Finance for verification on a bi-weekly basis.</p>
<p>Article 5 These measures shall be implemented from the date of promulgation.</p>
<h3>The Legislative Yuan Resolves to Return the Revised General Budget for the Second Half of the Year to the Executive Yuan, Requesting That a Supplementary Budget Be Separately Prepared and Submitted to the Yuan for Review</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper, Nanjing, 8th] There was a surprising development at the regular meeting of the Legislative Yuan on the morning of the 8th. With swift methods, it resolutely and unanimously passed the temporary motion of more than 30 people, including Yin Shuxian, Cui Jingbo, Song Shuqiao, Liu Quanzhong, Xu Zhongyue, Deng Gongxuan, Cheng Yuanzhen, and Wu Hexuan, stating that "the revised general budget for the second half of the 37th year of the central government does not comply with the regulations, and it is proposed that it be resolved to return it to the Executive Yuan for the separate preparation of a supplementary budget." The original text of the motion stated: "After the currency reform, the Executive Yuan can use the financial and economic emergency decree to convert the national general budget for the second half of the 37th year into gold yuan and notify this Yuan of the figures. If a supplementary budget is necessary, it can also be prepared separately and submitted to the Yuan for review. The content of the revised budget submitted by the Executive Yuan is extremely complex, does not comply with the regulations of the Budget Law, and has no explicit basis in the Constitution. In order to maintain the resolution of the statutory budget of this Yuan and to prevent any misinterpretations of the normal practice of constitutional government, it is proposed to return the revised budget submitted by the Executive Yuan and request that it prepare a supplementary budget separately, which would be fortunate." After the text of the motion was read by the secretarial staff, the mover Yin Shuxian made a brief oral explanation, emphasizing the illegality of the revised general budget and urging the members to pay attention to not setting a bad precedent. Subsequently, Song Shuqiao supplemented the reasons for returning it, stating two points: From a legal point of view, the general budget is a bill formulated based on the Constitution and the Budget Law, and can only be supplemented but not revised. Therefore, the Executive Yuan's addition of a large amount of budget through revision is illegal, so the Legislative Yuan cannot follow suit and violate the law. From a factual point of view, the increased tax revenue in the revenue portion of the revised general budget has not yet completed the legislative process, and the Legislative Yuan has not yet expressed its recognition of this illegal measure, so it cannot be reviewed. The various expenditures added in the expenditure portion are also illegal. According to the implementation regulations of the general budget previously formulated by the Legislative Yuan, only the living allowance for public school teachers and staff can be adjusted and calculated according to the cost of living index, while the public expenses in the revised budget have increased eight to ten times, so there is no basis for reviewing them. Subsequently, Wu Wangji and Wang Menglin made speeches in favor, pointing out that at the beginning of constitutional government, everything should follow constitutional norms, and the Constitution should not be misinterpreted, and the law should not be defiled. At this point, the chairman of the meeting, President Sun, submitted the original motion to a vote, and the assembly applauded and unanimously agreed to pass the motion as is.</p>

Later, the members spoke one after another, expressing their support, and some members discussed that the government should not excessively use the temporary provisions of the Suppression of Rebellion Period, otherwise, if the Legislative Yuan had to use the power of Article 57, Paragraph 2 of the Constitution to change the Executive Yuan's important policies, it would not be a blessing for the people and the country. The meeting adjourned at 12 noon. The meeting continued at 3:30 PM in the afternoon, and more than ten people continued to speak on this case, mostly in favor of the case. They believed that the Legislative Yuan must first establish credibility, and the fees of state-owned enterprises must not lead to price increases, otherwise it would be ridiculed as "officials are allowed to set fires, but the people are not allowed to light lamps," and if the government destroys its own laws and regulations, it will not be able to implement various financial and economic emergency measures, then the credibility of the Gold Yuan notes will be shaken, and the financial and economic situation will be out of control. After discussing for about two hours, the result of the vote was to change the original case to an inquiry case, asking the Executive Yuan whether it had decided to adjust state-owned enterprises immediately, and stating that the Legislative Yuan opposed the price increase. Finally, the temporary motion of Hao Yaodong and more than 30 others was passed without objection, resolving to invite Premier Weng of the Executive Yuan and the responsible officials of the US Aid Utilization Committee to attend the tenth regular meeting on the 12th to report on the distribution standards and utilization of US aid.

<h3>To Stop State-Owned Enterprises from Raising Prices, the Legislative Yuan Changed the Discussion Result to an Inquiry Case, and Invited Premier Weng to Report on the Use of US Aid at the Regular Meeting on the 12th</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper, Nanjing, 8th] The ninth meeting of the second session of the Legislative Yuan was held on the 8th, presided over by President Sun. The meeting started at 9:30 AM. First, the reporting items were carried out, and then two temporary reporting items were heard: First, the Executive Yuan's News Bureau replied that the Ministry of Interior had formulated three measures to deal with the leakage of confidential information by newspapers: (1) For minor violations, a notice will be issued to pay attention; (2) For negligence, a warning will be issued; (3) For serious violations, a severe warning will be issued. Second, the Budget Committee reported the "Draft Examination Procedure for the National General Budget" which was revised according to the opinions of the Yuan meeting. After a brief discussion, it was revised and passed. Then, the temporary motion of Yin Shuxian and more than 30 others was discussed, stating that "the revised general budget for the second half of the 37th year of the central government does not comply with the regulations, and it is proposed that it be resolved to return it to the Executive Yuan for the separate preparation of a supplementary budget." After it was passed without objection, the discussion items listed on the agenda began to be carried out. The first case was the proposal by Lian Mou and others to expedite the request to the Executive Yuan to stop state-owned enterprises from unilaterally raising prices immediately. When Yun made the explanation, he presented the government's current subsidy expenditure figures, which totaled 26 million gold yuan per month for national highways, railways, posts, and telecommunications, 18 million gold yuan per month for rationing food in five major cities, 12 million gold yuan per month for public utilities in Shanghai, and 8 million gold yuan per month for enterprises under the Commission of Resources. The government was too negligent in not preparing for these huge expenditure figures in advance, but if it rashly increased the prices of state-owned enterprises for this reason, it would be tantamount to destroying its own laws and regulations, leading price increases, and destroying the credibility of the Gold Yuan notes. Therefore, he formulated three measures (see this newspaper on the 6th) and presented this case. Lian explained</p>

<h3>Editorial: Starting with the Price Increase Issue of State-Run Enterprises</h3>
<p>State-run enterprises are once again considering price increases, especially for transportation and public utility services, where price increases seem inevitable. The managers of these enterprises cite rising operating costs and demand price increases to maintain operations. The government also cannot continue to bear subsidies, which would affect the balance of the national treasury. There is a growing trend to approve price adjustments. However, the Legislative Yuan believes that price increases by state-run enterprises would stir up public discontent, affect currency value, and argues that state-run enterprises should cut staff and tighten expenses, or that the government should find other ways to compensate for their losses. There are reasons for and against price increases, truly "each has their own reasons." One legislator said, "If state-run enterprises raise prices, the people cannot bear it; if they don't raise prices, the country cannot bear it." The difficulty of solving this problem can be summed up in one sentence. This past month and a half has truly exhausted the minds of politicians and experts!</p>
<p>In reality, the crux of the problem is not whether state-run enterprises should raise prices, but that the entire economic reform plan has glaring loopholes and the execution techniques have made mistakes that misplaced cause and effect. The plan clearly stipulates that various tax revenues should be adjusted with reference to pre-war standards, and the fees for state-run and public transportation services should also be adjusted with reference to pre-war standards. However, the prices of various goods and services nationwide should be sold at the prices prevailing in each locality on August 19, 1948, converted into gold yuan at the exchange rate. This seems to say that state-run enterprises and taxes can be adjusted to pre-war standards, while private enterprises and the people's labor must be frozen at the "August 19th" price limit. How contradictory! Yet, it was clearly stated in the economic reform plan, which concerns the fate of the country and the people. How can anyone remedy it afterward? Think about it. Since tax rates have been raised, the price of goods must also be raised. If the cost of power and transportation increases, the cost of goods will certainly increase again. If the cost of goods is high, but the price of goods is only allowed to be fixed within the price limit, how can the people engaged in production industries bear it? If they cannot bear it, they have to gradually stop work and close down. However, stopping work and closing down is not allowed by the government. Moreover, the consequence of stopping work and closing down is, of course, an increase in unemployment and a shortage of materials. In this way, repeating the cycle, even if currency reform achieves 100% success, what benefit will it bring to the national economy and the people's livelihood?</p>
<p>Furthermore, to control prices, comprehensive control is required. If only the prices in one place are controlled, but the prices in other places are not controlled, or only the prices of finished products are controlled, but the prices of raw materials are not controlled, how can fairness be achieved for all parties? Take fuel diesel as an example: diesel is the prime mover of industry and shipping, especially shipping, where fuel consumption accounts for the largest portion of the cost. To prevent freight rates from increasing, diesel prices must first be prevented from rising. However, diesel comes from foreign countries, and foreign businessmen will not listen to you. They say that prices must rise, or they will stop supplying, so you have to let them raise prices. Now diesel prices have risen by 100%, but freight rates have to be fixed at the "August 19th" price limit. How can the business be maintained? No wonder the Shipowners' Association called for their difficulties at the second members' meeting. In the past, the exchange settlement method was used, which was no different from the government secretly subsidizing. Now the government can no longer afford to subsidize public transportation, so what should be done? Is the burden of losses that the government cannot afford any less bearable for people running businesses? When the people can't bear it, they can only choose to close down and stop operating. Public transportation is different from other businesses. It is closely related to people's lives. If they really stop supplying for a day, everyone will be crying! In the past, during the legal tender period, the government did not want to hear crying, so it constantly adjusted various prices. When oil prices were adjusted, or foreign exchange rates were raised, freight rates also followed suit. When the cost of goods increased, prices rose accordingly, and the cost of living also increased, so freight rates had to be adjusted again. In this way, in a cycle, prices rose without end, and the legal tender expanded recklessly, competing with each other until it became unmanageable. This was the style of the legal tender period and the fatal wound of the legal tender. The reason for the injury was actually the reversal of cause and effect in the execution techniques. Now that currency reform is only allowed to succeed and not fail, the failures of the past should be used as a warning.</p>
<p>Before implementing the economic reform plan, don't rush into action. If various tax revenues are adjusted first, the prices of state-run, public, and transportation services are also adjusted, the prices of various goods are allowed to adjust to their natural trend, and the cost of living index is also accurately adjusted according to the latest prices, then suddenly announce a practical and feasible comprehensive economic reform plan at an appropriate time. Then the various technical problems of today will not occur. If the tax rate on cigarettes had been adjusted before the reform, how could the increase in cigarette prices have caused a wave of panic buying? If the prices of state-run, public, and transportation services had been adjusted before the reform, and the state-run petroleum company had purchased sufficient fuel diesel before the reform, why would the Legislative Yuan be in such a dilemma today? What's done is done, and regret is too late, but we should not continue to make mistakes and repeat the mistakes of the legal tender period. In other words, the administrative and legislative authorities should open the skylight and speak frankly, recognize the current reality, make thorough corrections, so that future crises can be averted in time, and economic reform can be fully successful.</p>
<p>To ensure the complete success of economic reform, it is necessary to ensure that the people can bear it, and the government can also bear it, but more importantly, it is necessary to ensure that all those engaged in production and operation can also bear it, so that economic activity can continue without interruption, and people's lives will not be affected. We must know that all legitimate industrial and commercial businesses are related to production. It cannot be assumed that only opening a factory is production, while running a shipping business, transportation business, public utility business, financial business, or insurance business is not production. Because the economic reform plan was drawn up in a hurry, there are inevitably many loopholes. The mobilization order also requires the Executive Yuan to stipulate supplementary measures at any time. Therefore, the administrative authorities should have the courage to quickly remedy it, and the execution should not only know to rely on the published and engraved plan, without taking measures to mend the fold after losing the sheep. We believe that the government may as well quickly calculate the cost of various goods in a comprehensive way, and make a reasonable adjustment to the prices of various goods again, and state-run, public, and transportation services are of course no exception. After this reasonable adjustment, the strict enforcement of price limits will not cause great difficulties, and the people's livelihood can be expected to gradually stabilize. If we still disregard reality and only shout "No price increase beyond August 19th" without noticing whether the production volume of "August 19th" can still be maintained, it would be like knowing one thing but not knowing the other.</p>
<p>Today, the central government will discuss and formulate methods to stop panic buying, and has also paid attention to how to increase production and how to dredge the source of materials, and also knows that the adjustment of co-ordination and price increases are different, then we hope that the government will make a total reasonable adjustment, rather than a price stabilization exercise with endless circulars.</p>

Oil and salt rationing will also be organized immediately. Daily necessities such as cloth and soap are scheduled for rationing.

<h3>Central Bank Manager in Nanjing Engaged in Private Interests; Receives One Month Suspension</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 8th Dispatch] Li Jialong, the current manager of the Nanjing Branch of the Central Bank, was recently punished by the Disciplinary Committee for Public Officials of the Control Yuan for engaging in illegal private interests. The main text is: "Li Jialong will be suspended from his position for ten months." This punishment has begun to be implemented. Li's facts of engaging in illegal private interests are due to the fact that when the Japanese army invaded in November 1937, Li sold his house in Houtou Lane to the Central Bank for 40,000 yuan in order to protect his private property and exchanged it for more than 11,000 US dollars in foreign exchange at a rate of 3.3 yuan. After the victory of the Anti-Japanese War in 1945, the house was used by the Central Bank, and Li requested to buy back the house at the original price in 1946 and re-rent it for profit. The Control Yuan impeached him and transferred him to the Disciplinary Committee for Public Officials for handling. The Committee held that Li used his position as the branch manager to buy back the house, which was obviously a use of his official position to benefit himself. The negligence was difficult to absolve, so it was decided to punish him. As for buying US dollars with the house price and signing the request to buy it back and re-rent it for profit after the victory, it was not considered illegal profit-making liability.</p>

<p>[Taishi Dispatch] It is reported that in order to replenish the bandit troops south of the Yellow River, the bandits previously planned to forcibly enlist 700,000 soldiers in the Jin-Hebei-Lu-Yu border area. However, the general public's anti-war sentiment is extremely high, and they have tried every means to escape. So far, the quota has not been met. During the Yellow River flood area battles, the bandits sent more than 40,000 new recruits from the Southern Hebei area across the Yellow River to supplement Chen Yi's bandit troops. More than 5,000 were killed or wounded in the Yudong campaign.

<h3>Non-Permanent Members of the Security Council: Norway, Egypt, and Cuba Elected; China, France, Chile, and Peru Re-elected to the Economic and Social Council; General Assembly Passes Draft Convention on the Control of Potent Synthetic Narcotics</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 8th] At the United Nations General Assembly meeting this morning, when voting for non-permanent members of the Security Council, Cuba, Norway, and Egypt were elected as non-permanent members to replace Belgium, Colombia, and Syria, whose terms expire at the end of this year. Cuba and Norway obtained the required two-thirds vote of all members in the first round of voting. However, Egypt and Turkey competed for votes as if evenly matched, and Egypt was not elected until the fourth ballot. The voting was conducted by secret ballot, with the following results: In the first round, a total of 58 countries were eligible to vote, and only 53 countries actually voted (including 5 abstentions), so there were no invalid votes. As a result, Cuba received 53 votes, Norway 44 votes, Egypt 30 votes, and Turkey 23 votes. Cuba and Norway, having obtained the required 36 votes, were both elected as non-permanent members. In the second round, the number of actual votes cast among the 58 countries was 56, including two invalid votes. The necessary majority to be elected remained 36 votes. Egypt received 34 votes, and Turkey 20 votes. In the third round, the number of actual votes cast was 56, with no invalid votes. The necessary majority was 38 votes, Egypt received 37 votes, and Turkey received 19 votes. In the fourth round, the actual number of votes was 57, with no invalid votes. The necessary majority was 38 votes, Egypt received 38 votes, and Turkey received 19 votes. Therefore, Egypt was elected as a non-permanent member of the Security Council for the next term. As for the other three non-permanent members of the Security Council, namely Argentina, Canada, and Ukraine, they will continue to serve until the end of 1949. The allocation of seats for the non-permanent members this time is still the same as the previous plan, namely, Latin America must allocate one seat, so Cuba replaces Colombia; Northern Europe must allocate one seat, so Norway replaces Belgium; and the Middle East must allocate one seat, so Egypt replaces Syria.</p>
<p>Subsequently, the General Assembly elected new members of the Economic and Social Council to replace the six members whose terms expire, namely China, France, the Netherlands, Canada, Chile, and Peru. As a result, China, France, Peru, India, Belgium, and Chile were elected. The General Assembly then began to debate the draft convention on the international control of certain narcotics passed by the Third Committee (Narcotics Committee). These narcotics were not included in the 1931 International Narcotics Control Treaty. The General Assembly then adjourned until 2:00 PM.</p>
<p>[This Newspaper] Paris, 8th Broadcast: The General Assembly held a plenary session on the 8th and passed the following proposals: (1) Draft Convention on the International Control of Potent Synthetic Narcotics. (2) The Mexican representative's suggestion to include in the agenda that the major powers should make further efforts to resolve disputes to establish lasting peace. (3) In principle, the establishment of a United Nations postal agency and the issuance of special stamps.</p>
<h3>Evatt Appeals to the Four Powers to Halt the Cold War for Three Months to Allow Opportunity to Resolve the Berlin Problem; Six Neutral Countries Endeavor to Mediate</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper] Paris, 8th Broadcast: It is reported that the President of the General Assembly, Australian Foreign Minister Evatt, and the Secretary-General of the United Nations, Lie, are currently in informal contact with the four powers, appealing to the four powers for a three-month truce on Berlin, so that the foreign ministers' conference of the four powers can have sufficient time to discuss a lasting solution. Officials are unwilling to comment on this rumor, but spokesmen for Britain and the United States said that their respective governments would not accept such a temporary truce proposal.</p>
<p>[United Press, Paris, 8th] It is reported that delegations from countries other than the Soviet Union in the Security Council have reached a general agreement in private talks on the 8th to demand that the Soviet Union lift the blockade of Berlin. Well-informed sources said that a compromise plan is being drafted behind the scenes, proposing simultaneous actions: lift the Berlin blockade on one hand, and resume the four powers' foreign ministers' conference to discuss the German peace treaty on the other. The Security Council and the Political Committee, which have become the center of the East-West conflict, are not scheduled to meet on the 8th.</p>
<p>It is reported that the Western three powers have withdrawn to the background and allowed the other six neutral countries in the Security Council to take the initiative. The United Nations action to break the Berlin blockade, with Argentine representative Bramuglia as the mediator, will hold many informal talks on the 8th. The neutral countries believe that there are many ways to compromise between East and West, and these ways can prevent long-term conflicts and avoid making this General Assembly fruitless.</p>
<p>[United Press, Paris, 8th] Argentine Foreign Minister Bramuglia actively took on the responsibility of mediating the Berlin crisis on the 8th, talking with Soviet representative Vyshinsky for more than an hour to find a compromise solution. The content of their long talks has been kept secret so far, and even the nature of the compromise solution is unknown. However, it is reliably known that the solution agreed upon by the member states of the Security Council unrelated to the Berlin dispute is not much different from the US proposal. Reliable sources said that Bramuglia and Vyshinsky were very satisfied with the talks on the 8th. Bramuglia also planned to talk with Chinese representative Jiang Tingfu and the only Soviet assistant, Ukrainian Foreign Minister Manuilsky, on the 8th.</p>

<h3>Spanish Monarchist and Socialist Parties Sign Anti-Franco Agreement; Copies Sent to Five Western European Countries and Washington</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, London, 8th] The British Foreign Office recently received a copy of the agreement signed by the leaders of the Spanish Monarchist and Socialist parties to promote cooperation between the two parties to change the Spanish regime. Copies of this agreement have also been sent to the United States and other signatory governments of the Brussels Treaty. The British Foreign Office stated that the US government is considering this agreement.</p>
<p>It is noted that the aforementioned leaders of the two Spanish parties visited Foreign Secretary Bevin last autumn. It is reported that Bevin encouraged them to cooperate at the time to facilitate a peaceful change of the Spanish regime. Although the British Foreign Office denied yesterday that Marshall had contacted US and French representatives in an attempt to overturn the United Nations resolution on Spain, it is still believed here that Marshall solicited the opinions of the British and French foreign ministers in Paris on whether to allow Spain to join the Western European Union.</p>
<p>[United Press, London, 8th] The Spanish Monarchist and Socialist parties have signed an anti-Franco cooperation treaty and submitted it to the governments of five Western European countries and the United States this week. Although officials refused to reveal the names of the Monarchist negotiators on the 8th, it is generally believed that Rubellbiru played an important role. Last year, when Rubell visited London, the Socialist leader Prieto happened to be in London. Rubell has published a denial in London, and British officials are also hesitant to claim that Rubell signed the treaty.</p>
<p>[United Press, Madrid, 9th] After the British Foreign Office announced that the Spanish Monarchist and Socialist parties had signed a cooperation treaty, the Spanish Foreign Office issued a statement here on the 8th denouncing it as "biased news, of course hateful, proving London's repeated attacks on Spain."    Prieto has spoken in Portugal, denying the Foreign Office's arbitrary criticism of other countries' internal affairs and inconsistencies. It also stated that the Spanish Foreign Office has instructed its ambassador to the UK to protest to the British Foreign Office.</p>

<p>[This Newspaper] Paris, 8th Broadcast: Soviet representative Malik firmly declared at the meeting of the Eleven-Nation Subcommittee that the Soviet Union could not accept the US plan to control atomic energy, therefore could not accept the resolution proposed by Canada, and requested the Atomic Energy Commission to cease work.</p>

<h3>Eden Speaks at Conservative Party Conference, Supporting British Foreign Policy; Conference Resolves to Strengthen Britain's Strategic and Economic Position</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Llandudno, Wales, 7th] The British Conservative Party held a national conference today to discuss the main points of imperial policy, which is to "strengthen the British Commonwealth as a strategic and economic unit." The meeting unanimously passed a resolution emphasizing this requirement, and passed an amendment advocating efforts to promote the abandonment of the Geneva Trade Agreement and not to approve the regulations formulated at the Havana Conference, as both restrict imperial preferential rights. Some representatives fear that the European Union plan may endanger Britain's imperial economic interests.</p>
<p>[United Press, Llandudno, Wales, 8th] Deputy leader of the opposition in the House of Commons, Eden, said in a speech to the Conservative Party conference here on the 8th: The international situation is rapidly deteriorating. He announced to the representatives discussing diplomacy his full support for Bevin's policy on the Berlin blockade, and said: "I feel extremely gloomy about the current international situation." He said that the West's response to the Soviet Union's proposal should be straightforward, that is, lift the blockade first, and then talk about the four powers' conference. He warned: "We will never tolerate further encroachment." Eden listed the Conservative Party's three major current goals - unity within the British Commonwealth, unity with Western Europe, and unity across the Atlantic. After Eden finished his speech, there was thunderous applause. He went on stage twice to thank the cheering crowd. The meeting also unanimously passed his speech as the Conservative Party's policy.</p>
<h3>New Rebellion Breaks Out in Burma</h3>
<p>Air Force Sent Out to Bomb</p>

<h3>Matsuoka Consults with Japanese Party Leaders for Opinions on Choosing New Prime Minister; We Hope That Progressive Elements in Japan Will Come Forward to Form a Cabinet</h3>
<p>[United Press, Tokyo, 8th] Speaker of the House Matsuoka took active action on the 8th in the selection of a new prime minister in order to decide as soon as possible and not delay the Diet's discussion of the Civil Service Law Amendment Bill proposed by MacArthur, which would deprive civil servants of the right to strike and collective bargaining.</p>
<p>After the Ashida Cabinet resigned due to the influence of the Showa Electric Company bribery case, the first thing at the special session of the Diet convened on October 11th was to elect a new prime minister. The special session was decided to be convened two weeks ago, and the purpose of the convening was to pass the Civil Service Law Amendment Bill and the Civil Servant Basic Salary Adjustment Bill. Matsuoka plans to invite the leaders of the four major political parties to discuss and request their cooperation in forming a four-party coalition cabinet. Matsuoka said: An agreement must be reached on the selection of a new prime minister and the policies of the new cabinet to avoid the phenomenon of each party competing after the Diet convenes. However, the difficulty lies in the fact that no political party in the Diet can occupy an absolute majority. It is generally predicted that the new cabinet will inevitably be extremely right-wing, because the Social Democratic Party has declared that they do not intend to participate in the new government. Shigeru Yoshida, the leader of the extremely right-wing Democratic Liberal Party, who previously served as prime minister, has the highest voice. Because the Democratic Liberal Party occupies the most seats in the Diet, but because other conservative parties have no good feelings towards him, it may hinder his election.</p>
<p>[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 8th] The Speaker of the House of Representatives, who is busy running around preparing for the nomination of the next prime minister, visited Yoshida, the president of the Democratic Liberal Party, on the morning of the 8th, and then went to the prime minister's official residence to visit Ashida, the president of the Democratic Party. In the afternoon, he continued to visit Katayama, the chairman of the Socialist Party, Miki, the chairman of the National Cooperative Party, and Satake, the secretary-general of the Social Renovation Party, to exchange opinions on the nomination of the next prime minister.</p>
<p>[New Asia News Agency, Nanjing, 8th] Since the news of the Ashida Cabinet's general resignation spread here, our government and those concerned about the situation in Japan have expressed deep attention. A reporter recently visited a political authority, who said: "Regarding the Ashida Cabinet's general resignation, it was expected by us, but its collapse due to the bribery case is quite embarrassing. As for the issue of the selection of a successor prime minister, we do not want to speculate or comment arbitrarily. However, in order for Japan to truly embark on the path of democracy and revival, only if this kind of person presides over domestic politics can they obtain international support."</p>
<h3>British Imperial Conference Scheduled to Open on the 11th</h3>
<p>[United Press, London, 8th] The British Imperial Conference will open on the 11th, with the theme of strengthening cooperation in defense, finance, and telecommunications. At 11:00 AM on the 11th, the seven prime ministers of the British Empire will sit around the mahogany conference table in the cabinet room at 10 Downing Street.</p>
<h3>North Korean Troops Suddenly Redeployed, Possibly to Replace Soviet Troops</h3>
<p>Only Three Miles from the South Korean Border</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Seoul, 8th] The North Korean People's Army, which was recently transferred from Wonsan to Cheorwon (only 18 nautical miles from the 38th parallel border), is reported to have (yesterday) moved to a place only three miles from the border. South Korean Interior Minister Yoon Chi-young said when he learned of this news: The sudden redeployment of a large number of communist troops is of unknown purpose. He did not state whether the South Korean troops would rush to the border to increase defenses, but said: The strength of the South Korean government and the North Korean regime is in a ratio of one to one hundred and fifty. Wonsan is located on the east coast of Korea, and the port of Yongheung Bay was originally the garrison of one of the North Korean People's Army, totaling 30,000 men, and has a railway to Cheorwon. An American military officer here said: He expressed doubt about the redeployment of communist troops. He also did not believe in the ratio of the strength of the South Korean army and the communist troops published by Yoon Chi-young. The officer also said: There are some American troops stationed on the 38th parallel border in North Korea. The redeployment of the North Korean People's Army may be to take over the defense duties of the withdrawing Soviet troops. Observers here believe that the withdrawal of Soviet troops (Moscow originally announced that the Soviet troops stationed in Korea would begin to withdraw from the 15th of this month) will facilitate the Soviet-trained North Korean troops to advance south to the border, so that the Soviet Union can place all responsibility on the North Korean regime.</p>
<h3>Syngman Rhee Scheduled to Go to Japan to Discuss the Return of Korean Residents' Property with MacArthur; Allied Headquarters Preparing to Hold a Grand Welcome</h3>
<p>[United Press, Seoul, 8th] President Syngman Rhee announced at a press conference on the 8th that he will travel to Tokyo on October 19th for a 48-hour trip to meet with MacArthur. Mrs. Rhee and one secretary will accompany him. Rhee pointed out: He will discuss many issues with the Allied Headquarters, one of which is the return of the property of the 600,000 Korean residents in Japan.</p>
<p>In response to reporters' questions, he said: He believes that negotiations on property rights issues are about to begin, and a solution to this issue will soon be decided. Rhee denied that he would meet with Zhang Qun, the former Premier of China. When asked by reporters about Zhang's proposal to organize an anti-communist front among Asian countries, Rhee said: This is not the "purpose" of his trip; but he said: He hopes to have the opportunity to talk with Zhang. "If Zhang comes to my office, we will treat him as a VIP." Regarding the US presence in Korea, Rhee said: "The United States has its reasons for coming to Korea. The purpose of the United States' coming to Korea is to drive the common enemy of the United States and Korea out of Korea. Now, the United States has the responsibility to help us solve the problem of the division of Korea." He hopes that the United States will stay in South Korea, at least "to give us the opportunity to train a national defense force."</p>
<p>[United Press, Tokyo, 8th] Sebold, Director of the Allied Headquarters Diplomatic Section, said on the 8th that the Allied Headquarters is preparing to hold a grand event at the Imperial Hotel in Tokyo on October 19th to welcome Korean President Syngman Rhee. Approximately 300 Allied occupation officers are invited to participate. Senior Allied Headquarters officials declined to comment on the purpose of Rhee's visit. One party believes that Rhee is accepting MacArthur's invitation because MacArthur invited Rhee to visit Japan when he flew to Korea to attend the ceremony commemorating the establishment of the Korean government.</p>

<h3>Over Half of General Inspection Completed: Over Ten Businesses Misappropriating Materials; Shanghai Authorities Discover Large-Scale Underground Warehouse</h3>
<p>[Our Report] The city's general material inspection commenced yesterday, proceeding very smoothly throughout the day. By evening, each district had, on average, completed over 60% of the inspection. It is anticipated that the entire inspection can be completed as scheduled today. Initial inspection results indicate that the Huangpu, Old Zha, New Cheng, and Songshan districts discovered the largest quantities of unreported materials and materials exceeding registered figures. Starting at 6:00 AM, 5,600 personnel dispatched by the Bureau of Social Affairs, the Municipal Police Bureau, the Youth Service Corps, the Bureau of Civil Affairs, the Military Police Corps, the Garrison Headquarters, and the police departments of the two Railway Bureaus reported to designated command locations within their assigned areas and assembled. They departed in groups after 8:00 AM. The city was divided into thirty command zones, with the heads of each precinct serving as commanders. Director General Yu Shuping of the Bureau of Social Affairs was stationed at the General Command Headquarters on the eighth floor of the Police Headquarters. In the early morning, at the start of the inspection, he personally visited the Huangpu, Songshan, and Old Zha districts, accompanying the heads of each precinct to inspect several warehouses. In the afternoon, he drove around to inspect the work progress in each district. Cheng Yi-kuan, the captain of the Economic Police Brigade, served as the head of the liaison group. Before the inspection began, he broadcast to the public via the police radio station, located at the General Command Headquarters, to answer telephone inquiries from personnel in each district and provide instructions on the work. The telephones at the General Command Headquarters rang constantly throughout the day. After arriving at the inspection locations, the workgroups, accompanied by local Baojia heads, presented their credentials to the warehouses and shops to be inspected. They reviewed the business licenses of the manufacturers and warehouses, and inspected the quantity of goods based on registration certificates. If the quantities matched, they stamped the back of the registration certificate to indicate completion. If the quantities did not match, they sealed the goods and submitted them for review. Some of the unreported materials and materials exceeding registered figures were due to continued production by the factories, resulting in increased quantities. In addition, some manufacturers stored their materials in multiple districts, resulting in a warehouse in one district having fewer materials than listed on the registration form, while a warehouse in another district had additional materials beyond what was listed. In such cases, only the warehouse ledgers could be checked at the time, and a comprehensive cross-check would be conducted after the general inspection was completed. As of yesterday morning, Jing'an District had made the fastest progress, completing 81% of the inspection. Yulin and Wusong Districts had also completed 80% of the inspection. New Cheng and Huangpu Districts had both completed over 50%, while Old Zha District, due to the larger quantities, had only completed 34%. The inspection will continue today and is expected to be completed as scheduled.</p>
<p>[Another Report] The results of the first day of the general material inspection revealed that, in addition to discrepancies in the reported quantities, over ten businesses had moved materials without authorization after registration. Upon receiving the report, the General Command immediately ordered the responsible units to swiftly summon the responsible parties from these ten businesses for a thorough investigation. At the same time, Director General Yu solemnly stated last night that absolutely no movement of the seven designated registered materials would be permitted during the inspection period. Anyone who resists or violates this rule will be severely punished upon discovery, in addition to detention. Furthermore, by late last night, a large-scale underground warehouse was discovered in the western suburbs of Shanghai, containing a large quantity of various materials. In the case of caustic soda alone, there were over a hundred barrels. The responsible police precinct, after consulting the General Command by telegram, sealed off the warehouse overnight and assigned personnel to guard it.</p>
<h3>### Unauthorized Movement of Rice and Gauze; Over a Hundred Cases Discovered in Xuhui District</h3>
<p>[Our Report] The Shanghai Youth Service Corps, working with the criminal police team of the Xujiahui Police Precinct, mobilized its entire force yesterday and intercepted over a hundred cases of suspected unauthorized movement of cloth, gauze, paper, and rice within its jurisdiction.</p>
<h3>### No Limit on Quantity of Rice Sold at Stores; Rice Merchants' Request Not Considered</h3>
<p>[Our Report] Due to limited rice supplies, some stores have restricted purchases to one dou or five sheng per person. Director Wu of the Bureau of Social Affairs stated yesterday that the bureau has not issued any such regulations. Rice merchants previously requested a return to last year's system, where each household could not purchase more than five dou of rice at a time. Director Wu did not consider this request, but he did permit rice merchants to record the national ID card numbers of customers purchasing more than five dou of rice.</p>
<h3>### Half of Three Thousand Tons of Taiwanese Rice Already Shipped to Shanghai</h3>
<p>Half of the three thousand tons of Taiwanese rice being shipped to inland cities to augment food supplies has already arrived in Shanghai, and the remaining fifteen hundred tons are ready for shipment. This is the first time that Taiwan Province has supplied the mainland with grain since the war. The grain was obtained by the Central Bank in exchange for fertilizer shipped to Taiwan. As for the 50,000 tons of US aid fertilizer to be exchanged for Taiwanese grain, Yang Chuo-an, the director of the Emergency Food Purchase and Storage Committee, has returned to Shanghai after flying to Taiwan to negotiate the deal. It is reported that opinions on the exchange ratio and quantity are not yet consistent and further consultations are needed.</p>
<h3>### Tailors Request Restrictions on Custom-Made Suits</h3>
<p>[Our Report] Due to the high number of people ordering custom-made suits, representatives from the tailors' guild visited Director Wu of the Bureau of Social Affairs yesterday, requesting restrictions on custom-made suits, limiting each person to one suit per national ID card. If the ID card has a stamp from a store indicating that cloth has already been purchased, then the cloth must be supplied by the customer. Director Wu is still considering this request.</p>
<h3>### Flour and Yarn Factories Lack Raw Materials; Ministry of Industry and Commerce Promises Assistance</h3>
<p>[Our Report] Flour and yarn factories in the city lack raw materials, Director Wu Kai-xian of the Bureau of Social Affairs said yesterday. During his recent trip to Beijing, he discussed the problem of raw material shortages for factories in the city with Minister Chen of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce. Minister Chen indicated that the ministry would make every effort to assist with the supply of raw materials. Director Wu also discussed the issues of relief for unemployed workers and winter relief this year with Minister Gu of the Ministry of Social Affairs. Minister Gu stated that the central government could assist with half the cost of resettling refugees. He hoped that local governments would do their best to raise funds for winter relief, and that they should not rely entirely on the central government.</p>
<h3>### Wu Guozhen and Jiang Jingguo Returned to Shanghai Yesterday</h3>
<p>[Our Report] Mayor Wu returned to Shanghai by overnight sleeper train last night, after completing his official business in Beijing attending the economic management conference of three provinces and two cities.</p>
<p>[Another Report] Jiang Jingguo returned to Shanghai last night at 11 PM after leaving Beijing yesterday morning for Wuxi to investigate the rice market and attend a conference.

<h3>### Economic Management Authorities Issue Late-Night Statement: Price Increase Request for Wool Yarn Not Approved by Review Committee</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Shanghai] Regarding the adjustment of wool yarn prices, a spokesperson for the Economic Supervisory Office issued a statement late last night, stating that the Bureau of Social Affairs has submitted the cost sheets prepared by the Wool Textile Industry Association to the Price Review Committee for approval. The committee has not yet approved them, and wool yarn prices must not be raised without authorization before the committee approves.</p>
<p>Bureau of Social Affairs Approves 50% Increase</p>
<p>[Our Report] According to sources at the Bureau of Social Affairs: The Wool Textile Industry Association submitted a request to the Bureau of Social Affairs to adjust wool yarn prices due to cost issues. It has now been approved to increase by 50%, effective yesterday. The new prices are as follows: High-grade yarn, 18.4 yuan per pound (Four Bees, Hero, Earth, Queen, etc. brands). Mid-grade yarn, 15.5 yuan per pound (such as Azalea, Green Beauty, etc. brands). Low-grade coarse yarn, 11.9 yuan per pound (Xiao Nan, Shuang Yang, Scholar, etc. brands). High-grade fine yarn, 25.1 yuan per pound (Three Bees, Earth, Queen, etc. brands).</p>
<p>Director's Remarks</p>
<p>Director Wu Kai-xian of the Bureau of Social Affairs issued a statement regarding the wool yarn price adjustment, stating: Wool yarn had no factory price on August 19th and was only sold in a few stores. The Bureau of Social Affairs accordingly set a retail price limit. Later, the association requested the setting of a factory price upon opening the market. Representatives of the wool textile industry also sought instructions from Supervisor Jiang, and the Supervisor's Office instructed the Bureau of Social Affairs to review it. The Bureau of Social Affairs then ordered the association to provide production costs, which were far from the retail price limit. For the sake of caution, it was sent to the Wool Department of the China Textile Company for review. The review results showed that the required production costs were similar to the figures submitted by the association. The report was submitted to the Shanghai Area Price Review Committee at its meeting last Saturday. After discussion, the new price was set according to the production costs reviewed by the China Textile Company.</p>
<p>Hoping for Citizens' Understanding</p>
<p>Director Wu believes that the purpose of price controls is defeated if factories are forced to close and cease production. Wool yarn has reached a point where it can no longer be sustained due to the high cost of raw material foreign exchange and tariffs. Anle Wool Yarn Factory stopped work a week ago because it lacked wool raw materials. In order to maintain the permanent production of factories, the government has adjusted the price limit according to production costs, hoping that citizens can understand the government's difficult position in maintaining industry and commerce.</p>
<p>Movie and Theater Ticket Prices Approved for Adjustment</p>
<p>[Another Report] The theater and film industries repeatedly requested adjustments to ticket prices because unreasonable discrepancies arose between theaters after the rigid price limits were set on August 19. It has been learned that the Shanghai Area Price Review Committee has approved a slight adjustment, which is currently being reviewed by the Bureau of Social Affairs. Ticket prices at all storytelling venues will be adjusted first.</p>
<p>Seasonal Vegetable Prices Approved, Awaiting Approval</p>
<p>[Our Report] The Price Management Section of the Bureau of Social Affairs convened representatives from vegetable sellers, fish markets, the Fisheries Management Office, the Police Bureau, and the Finance Bureau yesterday afternoon to review the price limits for fresh seasonal vegetables. The prices will be announced after Director Wu approves them. Those prices that already have an August 19th limit will not be adjusted unless there are special circumstances.</p>

<h3>### Implementation of Application Procedures for Transporting Materials Out of Shanghai</h3>
<p>[Our Report] In order to prevent the escape of materials, the Supervisor's Office previously prohibited the export of materials from Shanghai. However, in order to maintain the legitimate needs of industry and commerce, it has established the "Shanghai Area Application Procedure for Transporting Materials Out of Shanghai," based on Article 3 of the "Shanghai Area Prohibition of Transporting Materials Out of Shanghai," which went into effect yesterday. The maximum quantity allowed to be transported is based on the average total amount of materials shipped from Shanghai to that location in the first half of this year. There are also strict technical regulations to prevent abuse. The application procedure consists of twelve articles. When purchasing materials from Shanghai, other locations must apply to the relevant trade association in the city to issue a transit certificate, and they must obtain certification from the local government of the place of application before the materials can be allowed to leave Shanghai. In the future, if hoarding, profiteering, or other illegal activities are discovered, the responsible trade association that made the application will be held responsible.</p>
<h3>### Kerosene Approved for 50% Price Increase</h3>

<h3>### Three Hoarding Cases Prosecuted</h3>
<p>[Our Report] The District Prosecutor's Office yesterday filed public prosecutions against three cases of hoarding and profiteering: (1) Gao Yuzhong, from Hebei, is the manager of the Tianfu Tang Chinese Medicine Shop at 54 Linsen Middle Road. He hoarded 195 bags of flour and 19 barrels of saccharin in his shop. (2) Wang Gang, from Taicang, hoarded 17 boxes and 39 bars of soap in Room 209 of the Central Hotel. (3) Xi Zhimei, who runs the Yuanfengxing Grain Shop in Zhoupu Town, Nanhui, and her employee Ji Taikang, purchased a total of 900 bags of warehouse receipts from Fuxin and Fufeng flour mills in Shanghai in July, intending to sell them at a higher price. However, due to the recent general inspection of hoarded goods in the city, they hired a boat to transport them back to Nanhui for hoarding. They were discovered and detained by the Sicheng Police Precinct when they reached Liuli Bridge in Pudong. At the same time, another 11 pieces of cotton yarn were found hoarded in the rice shop.</p>
<h3>### Aftermath of Wang Xiaohe Incident; Labor Community Petitions Authorities</h3>
<p>[Our Report] At around 10 AM yesterday morning, Zhang Zhusan, Chairman of the Shanghai General Labor Union, Zhou Weixin, Chairman of the Electrical Workers' Union, Liang Yongzhang, Secretary-General of the General Labor Union, and more than 20 directors and supervisors from the two labor unions, visited Mayor Wu to request justice, believing that a certain newspaper's editorial, "Don't Create Another Wang Xiaohe," distorted the facts and insulted the labor union. The mayor personally received them. After the petitioning representatives explained the situation, the mayor promised to handle it after a detailed investigation. After leaving the Municipal Government, the petitioning group also went to the Supervisor's Office, the Bureau of Social Affairs, and the Garrison Headquarters to petition.</p>
<h3>### Prosecution of Sauce Shop Owner for Shortchanging Oil Allotments</h3>
<p>[Our Report] Qiu Huanzhang, the owner of Wanyuan Ying Shop in the city, was entrusted by the Municipal Public Education Personnel Material Supply Committee to distribute cooking oil to public education personnel. In August of this year, he obscured the weight during distribution, shortchanging each allotment of three jin by four liang. A secret report was made to the Bureau of Weights and Measures, which dispatched personnel to investigate and found the report to be true. The case was sent to the District Prosecutor's Office, which recently filed a public prosecution on charges of adulteration.</p>
<h3>### Those with Duplicate Identity Cards Should Promptly and Voluntarily Return Them</h3>
<p>Some residents of the city have residences in two different locations. According to regulations, their national identity cards should be obtained in the location of their primary residence. In the past, some residents may have been unaware of this regulation, and some have obtained duplicate national identity cards. This is inconsistent with the legal requirement of one identity card per person for household registration and has many drawbacks. In order to strictly enforce the law, the Bureau of Civil Affairs has used population cards to identify the names of people with duplicate cards, notified the Baojia in each district to investigate and revoke them, and hopes that residents who have more than one identity card will promptly and voluntarily return the duplicate identity cards to the District Office or the local Bao office.</p>
<h3>### Director of the Bureau of Public Utilities Explains Key Points of Automobile Gasoline Conservation Measures</h3>
<p>[Our Report] Zhao Zengjue, Director of the Bureau of Public Utilities, and Wang Guanqing, Counselor of the Municipal Government, held a reception for reporters at the Municipal Government Conference Room at 5 PM yesterday to discuss the implementation of the Provisional Measures for Automobile Gasoline Conservation. First, Director Zhao explained the key points of the conservation measures as follows:</p>
<p>(1) In order to conserve foreign exchange and reduce gasoline imports, the city's gasoline allocation has also been reduced (previously, the city's gasoline allocation was 2.2 million gallons, but now, including oil for industrial use, there are only 1.15 million gallons). The Municipal Government received an order from the central government at the end of September to conserve automobile gasoline. In fact, if we want to implement a reasonable allocation, we need to prepare fully in advance. The time to implement the order is very short, so we are handling it according to the decision of the Automobile Gasoline Conservation Committee as follows: (A) All government agencies and private legal entities that meet the central government's requirements (i.e., banks, factories, mines, and private enterprises that are large-scale and related to daily necessities) will be handled according to the "one-in-four reduction" principle. Three of every four vehicles will be allocated the prescribed amount of oil, and the remaining vehicle will be allocated the basic amount of oil (10 gallons for small cars, 20 gallons for large cars). (B) Private legal entities that meet the requirements will be handled according to the "one-in-two reduction" principle. One of every two vehicles will be allocated the prescribed amount of oil, and the other vehicle will be allocated the basic amount of oil. (C) Individuals who meet the requirements, i.e., registered physicians, will have one vehicle allocated the prescribed amount of oil, and the rest will be given the basic amount of oil. (D) All private individuals who do not meet the requirements will be allocated the basic amount of oil.</p>
<p>(2) To take into account actual needs, we have issued a method for issuing application forms so that those who have a justified reason for special needs have the opportunity to apply. In order to estimate this additional oil allocation as soon as possible, all those who need to apply are requested to submit the application forms to the Fourth Division of the Bureau of Public Utilities at 139 Hankou Road before the 15th of this month so that they can be reviewed by the committee as soon as possible.</p>
<p>(3) In order to coordinate with each other and avoid being unable to supply, we will take into account the city's oil volume and actual needs to comprehensively handle the applications of each user.</p>
<h3>### Kaohsiung Restaurants Contacted to Ship Supplies to Shanghai</h3>
<p>Counselor Wang supplemented that, according to the results of the review by the review panel, the city's oil volume is already running low based on the above four regulations alone. There are also 3-400 physicians with cars in the city. The Municipal Government announced that all those who meet the central government's requirements for using cars should submit supporting documents. If all of them are qualified, the remaining oil is not enough to supply all the doctors. Therefore, those car owners who have special needs and apply must be given a discretionary allocation after being reviewed and qualified by the Small Review Committee from the remainder of the Municipal Government's original allocation.</p>
<p>Director Zhao also told reporters: In order to alleviate the gasoline shortage, the Bureau of Public Utilities is currently in contact with Taiwan Sugar Corporation, requesting that it ship Kaohsiung alcohol to Shanghai for distribution. Because gasoline and alcohol must be mixed with the chemical butanol, the China Petroleum Corporation has been asked to produce it in large quantities.</p>

<h3>### Unscrupulous Merchants Manufacturing Counterfeit Medicines; Secret Den Cracked Down on Zhongzheng West Road; Two Criminals Arrested and Sent to the District Prosecutor's Office</h3>
<p>[Our Report] The Jing'an Temple Police Precinct received a secret report at 8 PM on the 6th, saying that there was a counterfeit Western medicine operation at 10 Chongyang Lane, Nanjia Lane, Zhongzheng West Road. Director Du ordered Section Chief Yu Ding to dispatch Inspector Meng Ruisheng, police officer Yang Jinchun, and others to the address. According to the second landlord, Quan Dade, his cousin Li Dafa had recently rented the pavilion room, paying a monthly rent of two dou of rice, and had a hand-cranked machine for manufacturing quinine pills, etc. Personnel were dispatched to wait and watch. Li returned from outside at around 11 PM, and he was arrested and a large number of raw materials were seized in the pavilion room. He was taken back to the precinct along with the items. According to his confession: He is 21 years old, from Wenzhou, and was formerly a technician at the Zhongxing Pharmaceutical Factory on Moorehead North Road. Not long after, he met a pharmacist named Guo Songquan, who lives at 49 Jiu'an Lane, Xizang South Road, and runs the Huanan Pharmaceutical Firm, buying and selling medicines for customers. Two weeks ago, Guo instructed him to quit his business at the Zhongxing Pharmaceutical Factory and jointly manufacture counterfeit medicines. Guo would supply the raw materials, and Li would find a way to get the machines. It was agreed that they would split the profits 40/60, etc. The next morning, the handling officer arrested Guo and seized a copper seal and 102 bottles of completed quinine pills. According to his confession, he had completed 700 bottles of pills, and 600 bottles had been sold to the Rencheng Firm at 114 Zhongzheng East Road, and were being transferred by employee Xie Chuanyi to Shantou Yuanxing Pharmacy, at 1.4 yuan per bottle, and were currently being boxed for shipment, etc. Personnel were dispatched to arrest Xie, and his interrogation confirmed the facts. All of the counterfeit medicines were seized. In addition to Xie being released on bail, Guo and Li, along with the counterfeit medicines, were sent to the District Prosecutor's Office for verification and handling.</p>

<h3>How to Handle Losses of Public Utilities Still Undecided</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] The selling prices of public utility companies and public transportation companies in this city have suffered significant losses after being collected in accordance with the "August 19th" price limits.

<h3>Representatives Gather Together, Shipowners' Association Congress Opens; Resolution to Send Letter to US Shipowners Association to Respond to Restrictions on Japanese Merchant Ships</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] The annual general meeting of the National Shipowners' Association was officially opened at the City Chamber of Commerce at 9:00 a.m. yesterday. Those present included Huang Muzong, Director of the Shanghai Maritime Affairs Bureau, representing the Ministry of Communications, Li Shiheng, representing the Ministry of Social Affairs, and 106 representatives from 42 units of public associations in Beijing, Shanghai, Wuhan, Taiwan, Guangzhou, Qingdao, Tianjin, Chongqing, Xiamen, Changsha, and other places. After the meeting began, Chairman Du Yuesheng delivered a speech, giving a comprehensive review of the shipping industry at home and abroad over the past year. He stated that Chinese merchant ships have increased to 1.2 million tons, and Chinese ships are operating on routes such as China-Japan, China-America, and the Nanyang (Southeast Asia) routes, opening up a new chapter in the history of Chinese shipping. However, the shipping industry is a challenging undertaking, and its development and decline are closely related to the rise and fall of the nation.</p>
<p>Unyielding in Promoting Maritime Rights</p>
<p>The United Kingdom and other maritime nations are planning to complete a new ship construction program of 4.5 million tons by 1951. Furthermore, the Japanese shipping industry is beginning to recover, and our shipping industry should pay attention to this and be vigilant. As for the common problems encountered by the shipping industry, such as the difficulty in supplying fuel oil and coal, the burden of military transportation and passengers without tickets, the inability to obtain necessary foreign exchange, the disconnection of freight and passenger fare adjustments, and the lack of ship repair funds, although the government is concerned and sympathetic, it is hoped that the government can further implement positive policies to support the shipping industry. Our shipping industry should further improve its own organization, exert the power of sincere unity, facilitate transportation for the people, promote national maritime rights, work hard and persevere, so as to fulfill the contemporary mission of the Shipowners' Association. Subsequently, Li Shiheng, representing the Ministry of Social Affairs, and Huang Muzong, representing the Ministry of Communications, delivered instructions. Li stated that the shipping industry is more important than other commercial industries, and more difficult than other industries. It not only needs to complete the national waterway transportation network, but also exists in a complex international relationship. In order to cope with the current environment, it is necessary to strengthen organization, unite sincerely, in order to strengthen its own strength.</p>
<p>Unite Strength and Develop Outward</p>
<p>Huang stated that the increase in tonnage of Chinese ships in the past year has been slower than the increase in the previous two years. Due to banditry and prices, the volume of transportation has decreased, while operating expenses have increased, resulting in no ability to purchase ships and no ability to repair ships, forming a crisis in the operation of the shipping industry. In order to overcome difficulties and build a solid foundation, it is necessary to unite strength and develop outward, especially before the 4.5 million tons of new ship plans of various countries in the world are completed, and to establish Nanyang and Sino-US routes, develop overseas trade, and embrace the great era. Secretary-General Li Yunliang read the telegram from Minister He Yu of the Ministry of Communications, followed by a meeting of the Shipowners' Association Council and reports from public associations in various places. In the afternoon, proposals were discussed. Representatives from various places paid special attention to the issue of rebuilding the Japanese shipping industry. They all believed that in the last world war, Japan relied on its powerful merchant ship tonnage as a weapon of aggression. After Japan surrendered, its merchant ship tonnage should be restricted in accordance with the spirit of the Potsdam Declaration. The American Shipowners' Association sent a letter to Lu Cidelab and Zhengzhong to protest the issue of rebuilding the Japanese shipping industry. With deep consideration, it is thought-provoking, and it was unanimously resolved to send a letter to the American Shipowners' Association in response to its advocacy for restricting Japanese merchant ships.</p>

<p>Shen Suzhen, a 25-year-old woman from Nanjing, married Hu Kewen, a fellow villager. Later, Hu lost his job, and Shen was introduced to work as a female worker at the Shanghai Greater China Rubber Factory. Due to her hard work, she was repeatedly given raises, which caused jealousy among the female workers around her. They spread rumors that she had an affair with Wu Yongda, the foreman, which led to Wu's wife questioning and beating Shen and asking the guarantor to cancel the guarantee. Shen was subsequently fired by the factory. At this point, Shen was completely devastated. On the 6th, she took a bus to Dangzhou, got off the bus, walked alone to Chunting Bridge outside the North Gate, and jumped into the river to commit suicide.

<h3>Kowloon Miracle: Large Flight of Water Beetles</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from This Newspaper in Hong Kong, 5th] I remember two weeks ago, swarms of small yellow birds were discovered flying south from Canada over New York. In the dark of night, they flocked to the 1,000-foot-high Empire State Building, and many lost consciousness from crashing into the building. The small yellow birds fell like rain onto the streets, lasting for several hours, which was called a miracle. Recently, over the past two or three nights, a "slightly different" miracle has appeared on the Kowloon Peninsula across from Hong Kong. Between 1:00 a.m. and 4:00 a.m., tens of thousands of "dragon winds" flew in formation over Nathan Road, Tai Po Road, Waterloo Road, Argyle Street, and other places. "Night travelers" and police officers all witnessed this strange phenomenon.</p>
<p>"Dragon wind" is a small insect that can swim in water and fly in the air. It is found in the plains of the countryside, resembles a common stink bug, is the size of a teaspoon, and is a nourishing snack for the people of Guangdong after autumn, along with osmanthus cockroaches. Therefore, over these two or three nights, many shopkeepers or apprentices in Kowloon took cloth bags or thread nets to catch "dragon winds" and fry them to eat.</p>
<p>From a scientific point of view, there must be a reason for "dragon winds" to leave the plains and fly, but the citizens of Kowloon insist that it is a harbinger of a major disaster. They pointed out that in August 1941, Kowloon also discovered a large flight of "dragon winds." Afterwards, a major epidemic broke out in the villages of Kowloon City, killing more than a thousand people. In less than four months, the Japanese army invaded Kowloon, and Hong Kong suffered its greatest hardship in a century. After seven or eight years, the residents of Kowloon saw the black "dragon winds" returning in formation for the second time. They were panicked and believed that some major disaster was about to strike, and they were making ignorant speculations.</p>
<h3>International Background of the Greek Border Conflict (Middle) (Continued from This Newspaper on the 7th)</h3>
<p>— Xin Feng, Special Correspondent of This Newspaper in Europe</p>
<p>The current situation on the northern border of Greece must be observed in conjunction with the historical relationship between Greece and the three countries of Albania and Southern Europe. During the Balkan Wars in 1912 and after the First World War and between 1918 and 1939, Greece and Southern Europe maintained friendly relations. However, during the same period, relations between Greece and Albania were repeatedly disrupted due to a number of issues.</p>
<p>There were many reasons for the disputes between Greece and Albania between 1913 and 1948. After Albania became independent in 1913, the Albanian border was not resolved until July 30, 1926. At the same time, Greece, based on cultural and situational reasons, demanded the annexation of northern Epirus. Albania disagreed and instead demanded the annexation of southern Epirus, which belonged to Greece. This matter was particularly demanded between 1939 and 1941 due to the encouragement of the Italian fascist regime in Albania. Since November 1940, Albania has also invaded and occupied Greek territory after Italy declared war on Greece. Therefore, Greece still considers itself to be in a state of war with Albania, and normal diplomatic relations between the two countries have never been restored. Even when the Treaty of Peace was signed with Italy on February 10, 1947, the issue of northern Epirus remained unresolved.</p>
<p>During the Balkan War (1912-1913), the relationship between Greece and Yugoslavia was quite friendly, and they fought side by side during the First World War. On February 9, 1934, the two countries also jointly signed the Balkan Pact with Romania and Turkey. There is a rather intriguing point in the protocol of the treaty, which stipulates the following circumstances as acts of aggression:</p>
<p>"Supporting armed bandits within its territory and the invasion of another country's territory by bandits within its territory, or refusing the request of the invaded country to take effective measures to eliminate any assistance and protection of bandits within its territory."</p>
<p>The borders of the two countries were set by the Bucharest Convention on August 10, 1913. There were no serious border disputes between 1917 and 1944, but since then the Greek government has often felt uneasy due to various pretexts of Yugoslavia on the southern border of Greece. The main issue between Greece and Southern Europe is that Southern Europe wants to obtain its economic outlet in Thessaloniki on the Aegean Sea. This issue was originally resolved in the Greek-Southern European Treaty of May 10, 1923, which established a "free zone" for Southern Europe in Thessaloniki, and was further stipulated in the treaty of March 17, 1929, which provided greater freedom and convenience for the zone, as well as convenience in railway transportation.</p>
<p>Relations between Greece and Southern Europe were often disrupted between 1912 and 1948. After Bulgaria occupied southern Thrace, it continued to covet Macedonia. During the Greek civil war, Greece repeatedly provided Bulgaria with economic convenience in the Aegean Sea, and finally established a "free zone" for Greece in Thessaloniki in October 1925. However, Bulgaria did not make use of this convenience, because Bulgaria has always believed that in order to achieve its economic outlet, it must obtain that territory. In April 1941, Bulgaria participated in World War II and invaded western Thrace in an attempt to seize western Thrace, which belonged to Greece. After the end of World War II, Greece demanded to revise the border with Bulgaria in order to maintain the security of Greece along the Bulgarian border. Bulgaria not only disagreed, but also demanded the cession of all of western Thrace, which belonged to Greece. Although Greece signed a peace treaty with Bulgaria on February 10, 1947, normal diplomatic relations between the two countries have not yet been restored.</p>
<p>Greece and its Balkan Allies</p>
<p>Relations between Greece and its northern neighbors deteriorated between 1947 and 1948. The alliance system concluded in Eastern and Southern Europe during this period had a direct impact on this issue. When Albania and Southern Europe signed a treaty of alliance on July 9, 1946, they issued a declaration stating: "The signing of this treaty comes at a time when a certain party is attempting to launch another war, and at a time when its tendency to aggression is most evident." It also stated: "At a time when the aggression of the Greek Empire and its instigators against Albania and Southern Europe will endanger peace in the Balkans and the world."</p>
<p>Southern Europe and Bulgaria signed the same treaty of alliance on November 27, 1947, and its intention was clearly stated in the joint declaration of the two parties. When signing the treaty, the joint declaration of the two countries stated that they did not recognize the United Nations Balkan Committee, saying: "The representatives of the two countries unanimously believe that the establishment of the United Nations Balkan Committee is a violation of the spirit of the United Nations and the principle of unanimous agreement of the five powers, and endangers the sovereignty of the Balkan countries. Therefore, the two countries cannot cooperate with the committee and will not allow the committee to enter their territory."</p>
<p>Albania and Bulgaria also signed the same treaty of alliance on December 6, 1947, and their joint declaration stated:</p>
<p>"Regarding the restoration of diplomatic relations with Greece, the two governments believe that today's Greece is no longer an independent and sovereign country, and therefore cannot restore diplomatic relations... Their representatives expressed their sympathy to the Greek people for their struggle for national freedom on behalf of the Albanian and Bulgarian people." It also stated:</p>
<p>"The representatives of the two countries believe that the establishment of the United Nations Balkan Committee is a violation of the spirit of the United Nations and endangers the sovereignty of the Balkan countries. Therefore, the three countries cannot allow it to enter their territory."</p>
<p>At the same time, Albanian Prime Minister General Enver Hoxha announced to the press:</p>
<p>"Our people express their utmost sympathy to the heroic struggle of the Greek people. We will give them the strongest spiritual and political support, not only because they deserve it in all respects, but also because the free liberation of the Greek people will lay the foundation for peace and democracy in Europe and the Balkans, and the world will benefit from it."</p>
<p>Bulgarian Prime Minister Dmitrov said at the same time:</p>
<p>"We firmly believe that General Hoxha will agree to jointly support the Greek compatriots and their democratic army, whose victory is necessary for peace in the Balkans and international peace."</p>
<p>Bulgarian Prime Minister Dmitrov also said in his New Year's broadcast on December 31, 1947:</p>
<p>"The Greek fascist empire provokes disputes on our border and sends people to our country to engage in terrorism and espionage. The Bulgarian people deeply love lasting peace, so they are determined to work actively to defend their independence and are willing to be a solid and powerful member of Balkan democracy and peace. The heroic struggle of the Greeks for freedom and independence must be supported, because their southern neighbors are struggling for justice, which is a very valuable contribution to establishing friendly relations between the Balkan countries."</p>
<p>Although the Greek-Bulgarian peace treaty was signed on November 19, 1947, Greece's attempts to restore diplomatic relations with Bulgaria have been repeatedly met with various demands from the Bulgarian government, such as the withdrawal of Greek military liaison officers and the arrest of a large number of Greek people.</p>
<p>Regarding the relationship between Greece and its northern neighbors, the Greek representative reported to the Balkan Committee on December 2, 1947, saying in essence:</p>
<p>"The Greek government has always followed the spirit of the Charter and the resolutions of the United Nations General Assembly to seek a peaceful solution to its disputes with its northern neighbors. The Greek government also hopes to establish normal diplomatic relations with its three northern neighbors with the same enthusiasm and goodwill. The Greek government regrets that the relationship between Greece and its two southern countries in the past two years has not been as frank as in the past, but the Greek government firmly believes that Greece and its southern countries were not only once allies, but also fought side by side, and they will be able to respect each other to rebuild the way of cooperation. Regarding Bulgaria, Greece suffered three hardships in 30 years, and its occupation of Greek territory during World War II caused great losses and destruction to Greece. The Greek government has signed a peace treaty with it and is ready to rebuild diplomatic relations with it. As for Albania, our country is also very willing to rebuild normal diplomatic relations as soon as possible. Since 1940, Greece and Albania have always been in a state of war. We sincerely hope that the outstanding issues between the two countries can be resolved as soon as possible, and friendly diplomatic relations can be rebuilt" and so on. (To be continued)</p>

<h3>Increased Arrivals Seen Slightly Improving Rice Sales; China Trust Bureau Negotiating Foreign Rice Purchases from Thailand and Burma</h3>
<p>Rice arrivals have increased under the Market Management Committee's urging of businesses to register their stock. Yesterday's registered arrivals saw an increase, with the North Market receiving 723 "shi" (石, a unit of dry measure), mostly of white "geng" (粳, japonica rice) and "yangxian" (羊秈, a type of indica rice). The South Market received 199 "shi," consisting only of white "geng" and "yangxian," for a total of 922 "shi" of arrivals. Sales in the North Market have also shown some activity, although purchases are generally difficult to secure. Prices in the North Market are uniformly set at the maximum price limit.</p>
<p>Flour: Still no transactions. Retail outlets only receive twenty bags of allocated flour per day, which is not only insufficient to meet demand but also provides meager profits, inadequate to cover operating expenses.</p>
<p>Grains: Several types of miscellaneous grains saw limited sales. 165 bags of Poyang small soybeans were offered, but demand far exceeded supply, leaving most potential buyers empty-handed. A small amount of Anqing yellow soybeans was traded at $10.66 per unit. Secondary quality "guandian" red sorghum was priced at $10. In addition, a large quantity of sesame was offered, and nearly one hundred bags of shelled peanuts were also offered at the price limit.</p>
<p>Cooking Oil: Although the market has been ordered to close, many business representatives still gather, but no transactions take place. The Oil Association is currently occupied with registering the inventory of its members.</p>
<p>Furthermore: The China Trust Bureau, on behalf of the Grain Department, has purchased 55,000 tons of rice abroad, with 24,000 tons already arriving. This batch of rice was purchased from Siam. Due to recent unrest in Siam, further procurement is impossible. The Bureau has decided to switch to Annam and Burma to continue negotiating the purchase of 31,000 tons.</p>
<h3>Strict Review of Applications for Southward Transportation of Cooking Oil</h3>
<p>Previously, in response to requests from various regions and to strengthen the domestic flow of goods, the authorities partially lifted the ban on southward transportation of cooking oil. To ensure consistent procedures, the Export-Import Control Commission has stipulated the following measures for applying to transport cooking oil southward. The main points are as follows: (1) Cooking oil merchants in this city applying to transport cooking oil out of the city must present supporting documents and apply to the Export-Import Control Commission for approval before notifying Customs for clearance. Those not in this city may apply to the Export-Import Control Commission's branch offices. (2) The southward transportation of cooking oil is temporarily limited to Guangzhou, Shantou, and Xiamen. Cooking oil merchants in this city transporting cooking oil to the destination port must have certification from the cooking oil trade association at the destination port, listing the required transportation costs, oil quality, and quantity, and approved by the local governing authority. (3) The Export-Import Control Commission may set quotas based on the monthly cooking oil needs of various regions and allocate transportation within these limits. Applications exceeding the quota will be handled jointly by the Export-Import Control Commission and the Economic Supervisory Office. (4) After permission for the export of cooking oil is granted, the Export-Import Control Commission may notify the local governing authorities and submit the monthly amount of cooking oil transported out to the Executive Yuan for review.</p>
<h3>Vigorous Sugar Sales</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market was firm and active. With people taking a wait-and-see approach, trading within the market became sluggish. Sales on this street, however, were particularly robust, with businesses displaying strong demand. However, under price-controlled trading, holders were unwilling to easily part with their goods, and the market atmosphere was keen. The types of sugar offered on the market were extremely limited, with only limited quantities of "Xinghua" white, "Xinghua" red, and local sugar being sold off, and otherwise prices existed without goods.</p>
<h3>Nine Private Banks and Financial Houses Increase Capital</h3>
<p>Banking circles report: Local private banks and financial houses are actively increasing their capital. Nine have already made decisions:</p>
<p>(1) Jiading Commercial Bank: $500,000 (by October 30th). (2) Xintai Commercial Bank: $500,000 (by October 20th). (3) Zhejiang Commercial Savings Bank: $300,000 (by October 25th). (4) Pudong Bank: $500,000 (by October 15th). (5) Shende Financial House: $350,000 (by October 19th). (6) Yuanshun Financial House: $250,000 (by October 15th).

<p>[Also reported] Since the government announced measures for increasing capital in the banking and financial industries, banks and financial houses in various regions have been actively preparing for capital increases. In this city, more than fifty banks and financial houses have successively published notices to shareholders, convening extraordinary shareholders' meetings. Banks account for two-thirds of these, with the remainder being financial houses. So far, trust companies have not been heard to have any intention of increasing capital. According to reliable sources, most trust companies in this city, except for one or two, will merge with commercial banks and financial houses to establish banking and financial house trust departments to reduce the burden of increasing capital.</p>
<h3>Taxation Standards for Imported Goods</h3>
<p>Trade Promotion Association Requests Correction</p>
<p>Since the promulgation of the Emergency Measures for Financial and Economic Affairs, commodity prices across the country have complied with government regulations and been frozen according to the transaction prices of August 19th. However, the Customs continues to levy customs duties on various imported goods, either based on the foreign price plus 5% or estimated based on the market price, resulting in increased costs for imported goods. As a result, most manufacturers are wary of ordering raw materials from abroad, which not only causes significant damage to the business of importers, but also affects the supply and demand of raw materials. In view of this, the International Trade Promotion Association of this city recently submitted a special request to the Economic Control Supervisor's Office, requesting correction.</p>
<h3>Soaring Rubber Raw Materials; Finished Products Out of Stock</h3>
<p>Retailers Flock to Association Hoping to Receive Allocated Goods</p>
<p>Rubber manufacturers have recently suffered significant losses due to the effects of "panic buying." Large rubber factories such as Da Zhonghua and Zhengtai have delayed allocation dates as a passive resistance measure because the black market price of raw rubber has doubled the price ceiling and other raw materials have soared, resulting in a sharp increase in production costs. Small manufacturers, on the other hand, cite the production of military shoes as an excuse for not supplying goods in order to avoid losses, causing rubber merchants to fear that it will be difficult to replenish their stock after it is sold out, and their reserves are becoming increasingly depleted. All long boots, special sports shoes, and large flat boots have disappeared from the market. Only flat overshoes and low-end rubber shoes are available, and merchants from various regions continue to come to search for them. As for the Rubber Association, it has been closed for a long time. Recently, Yuanyuan Zipper Shoes were allocated to its members, divided into three grades: A, B, and C. Grade A members received one dozen, Grade B received nine pairs, and Grade C received six pairs, with an allocation price of $26.39 per dozen, totaling more than 200 dozen allocated. Many non-member retailers, unwilling to give up their right to receive allocations, have flocked to apply for membership, resulting in more than 100 units registering for membership in a single day, and a continuous stream of applicants.</p>
<h3>Private Cotton Mills Meeting Yesterday</h3>
<p>Discussing the Collection of Joint Purchase Funds</p>
<p>The Cotton Spinning Association of the Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, Beijing, and Shanghai regions convened a general meeting of representatives of all its private members regarding the iron collection of funds for the National Cotton Joint Purchase. More than 70 member representatives were present, chaired by Wang Qiyu. Matters discussed: (1) The proposal to pay two-thirds of the funds for the National Cotton Joint Procurement Office first. Resolved: Due to the financial difficulties of the member factories, the attending representatives are requested to consult with the Joint Procurement Committee to pay one-half first, and the remaining one-half will be paid subsequently when the cotton collection funds need to be increased. (2) The proposal to allow members with less than 3,000 spindles to purchase on their own at the price limit. Resolved: As this matter concerns overall joint procurement, all factories should uniformly abandon self-purchase. This association has no right to decide on this matter. All the difficulties mentioned by members with less than 3,000 spindles and the proposed remedial measures can be forwarded by the association to the National Cotton Joint Procurement Committee for review.</p>
<h3>Cotton Market Forbids Members from Entering</h3>
<p>After receiving orders to suspend trading, the Cotton Yarn Market Association authorities, in order to strictly comply with the law, have prohibited members from entering the market starting yesterday to prevent violations.</p>

However, fine yarn 32s Yanghe, 42s double-ply Lima, and Caiqiu mercerized thread are limited to one type per household. Duplicate purchases will be voided.</p>
<p>Joint Yarn Allocation</p>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] The Suzhou, Zhejiang, and Eastern Anhui Cotton Spinning Association's civil yarn allocation has reached its fifth phase. All of the first and second allocations totaled 2,050 pieces. From October 5th to 8th, the total amount of yarn and cloth sold independently by various private factories, as reported and converted to 20s cotton yarn, was 1,258 pieces of yarn and 25,941 bolts of cotton cloth. It is reported that the factories' slips for American aid cotton have also been completed and can be grouped to extract cotton tomorrow for factory use.</p>
<h3>China Textile Holds Board Meeting</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] China Textile Construction Company is scheduled to hold its third board meeting at 3:00 PM today. Chen Qitian, Minister of Industry and Commerce, will personally preside over the meeting.</p>
<p>It is heard that the meeting will discuss how to overcome the various difficulties encountered after the company's restructuring into a joint-stock company.束雲章 Shu Yunzhang, General Manager of the company, has been contemplating resignation due to the various difficulties facing the company that cannot be resolved, and has not been to the company for two weeks. His resignation is said to be firm.</p>
<h3>Spot Cotton Still Scarce</h3>
<p>Transactions in spot cotton have not been heard to have resumed. The market is invisibly deserted. Zhoupu seed cotton is being transacted at the limit price in small volumes.</p>
<h3>Two Major Problems in National Cotton Procurement: Panic Buying of Cotton in War Zones and Urgent Transportation of Shaanxi Cotton</h3>
<p>Since the authorities decided that this year's national cotton procurement work will be jointly undertaken by state banks and businesses to form a joint procurement office, all parties have been intensifying their efforts in this area. A reporter from the Joint Credit Investigation Bureau visited a cotton industry magnate yesterday morning to understand this year's national cotton production and procurement volume. According to his estimates, this year's national cotton production is approximately 8 to 9 million "sima dan" (司馬擔, a unit of weight), but most production areas are engulfed in war, so the actual amount received will likely be greatly reduced. Although cotton-producing areas such as Shaanxi are relatively stable, they cannot be transported out due to transportation limitations. Therefore, he believes that in addition to cooperating with businesses to form a joint procurement office, the authorities should also promptly find ways to address the issues of how to rush-purchase cotton in war zones and how to facilitate the transportation of raw cotton, so that the procurement work can be expected to be effective.</p>
<p>He also pointed out that the amount of cotton stored in Shaanxi is extremely abundant, approximately 300,000 "dan," but it cannot be transported out due to transportation difficulties. Textile factories in various regions are in a state of frequent or semi-shutdown due to the lack of raw materials, except for Shanghai, which is barely maintaining operation.</p>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] In order to facilitate the work, it is heard that after the National Cotton Joint Procurement Committee decided to jointly procure national cotton on a comprehensive basis, the persons in charge of the branch offices and stations established throughout the country will be temporarily transferred from the Textile Construction Company's branch offices as concurrent positions. The persons in charge of the various offices have already come to Shanghai by different routes and will hold a meeting to jointly discuss ways to promote joint procurement after Liu Gongyun, Chairman of the Joint Procurement Committee, returns to Shanghai.</p>
<p>Also reported: Wang Xingyao, the person in charge of the China National Products United Operation Company, visited Liu Gongyun, Deputy Governor of the National Bank, yesterday morning. According to him, the export of yarn and cloth has gradually improved due to the increase in exchange rates, but it is still difficult to expand due to export restrictions. He is now planning to request the National Bank to transfer the export trade of yarn and cloth to the Dutch East Indies to his company. The import of yarn and cloth in the Dutch East Indies is also the responsibility of local importers. If the trade could be handled by his company, export trade could be expanded.</p>
<p>The cotton cloth market also continues to be closed. Of the thirteen types of cloth previously sold by Textile Construction, 1,176 purchase orders were approved, totaling 39,710 bolts of cloth and 4,500 pounds of remnant cloth. Among these, 66 orders were from factories, receiving 5,670 bolts, 1,110 orders were from cloth stores, receiving 34,040 bolts, and 4,500 pounds of remnant cloth, valued at 883,951 Gold Yuan. The cloth supplied is mostly for retail stores in order of assigned number, with fewer wholesale stores.</p>
<p>Also reported: The cotton cloth association has sold out the cloth originally supplied to private dyeing factories and needs a slight delay of some days. About 60,000 more bolts may be supplied successively.</p>
<h3>Export-Import Control Commission Continues to Allocate Silk to Promote Exports of Silk Fabrics</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] According to the Export-Import Control Commission, the high cost of domestic raw silk, coupled with the competition from rayon and Japanese silk, has made exports difficult. In view of this, the Commission previously decided to allocate raw silk to silk factories to help them process silk fabrics for export, estimating that exporters of these finished products can profit. Recently, there has been enthusiastic participation from the various manufacturers applying to the Commission for allocation. Major silk weaving factories in this city, such as Meiya, Xinchang, Dafeng, Renfeng, and Shanghai Silk Weaving Production and Sales United Company, are all included. The first allocation was for Grade C and D raw silk, totaling 200 "dan," and is about to be fully allocated, with a total of US$140,000 expected. In order to continue reducing the production costs of manufacturers, promote increased production of silk fabrics, and earn foreign exchange, the Commission recently negotiated with the National Bank and obtained approval to allocate an additional 200 "zu" at the original allocation price (US$3.50 per pound for Grade D silk) for continued implementation. It is expected that the export of domestic silk fabrics will be more vigorously developed in the future.</p>

<h3>Promoting Mutual Understanding Among Asian Peoples; China Asia Relations Association Established in Nanjing, Elects Directors</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper from Nanjing on the 8th] The China Asia Relations Association held its inaugural meeting at the Overseas Chinese Guesthouse at 5:00 PM on the 8th. Over one hundred members of the four organizing groups, academic societies, and associations involved, as well as preparatory personnel Zhu Jia-hua and Zhang Dao-fan, attended.</p>
<p>Chairman's Address: Chairman Wu Tiecheng delivered an address, stating that Asia accounts for half of the world's population and occupies an important position internationally. It was decided at the Pan-Asia Conference in New Delhi last April to establish the Association, with the aim of promoting understanding and cooperation among the people of various Asian regions and contributing to peace and prosperity. Next year, China will be responsible for convening a conference.</p>
<p>Hu Shi's Speech: Hu Shi then delivered a speech, stating that 28 countries attended the conference in New Delhi last year, including Vice Minister Hang Li-wu representing China. China must be the host for next year's conference, so it is actively forming this association. As a university professor for 31 years and a university president for two years, he offered two suggestions from an educational standpoint for the China Asia Relations Association to consider: (1) China is a major world power, one of the Five Great Powers, and the largest country in Asia, but the nation's universities have not established departments or research on the languages, histories, and scripts of Asian countries such as Siam, Burma, India, Annam, and Korea in order to communicate and promote understanding. In the case of India, according to surveys, there are 400 million people, and the lack of communication in language and culture is regrettable. Since Peking University established a Department of Oriental Languages to study Sanskrit, the Islamic community has provided funds to send students to the university. It is hoped that the government will attach importance to this matter, because promoting cooperation and understanding among Asian countries requires cultivating talent in Oriental languages, scripts, and histories. (2) After World War II, imperialism was defeated, and nations were liberated to survive and establish themselves. Our overseas Chinese, earning a living with their hard work and sweat, often face misunderstandings and endure suffering. To remedy this, the most thorough solution is to increase understanding among the nations of Asia, which can be improved. Therefore, I believe that this association is not just an international diplomatic facade, but is related to all Asian countries, so that it can increase understanding and be the foundation for peace and prosperity. Subsequently, Cao Peizi, Director of the Department of Social Affairs, and Hang Liwu, Vice Minister of the Ministry of Education, reported on the preparations and passed the constitution.</p>
<p>Election of Directors: Hu Shi, Zhang Qun, Xu Chonghao, Jiang Menglin, Wu Tiecheng, Zhu Jiahua, Wang Shijie, Chen Guangyu, Wu Yifang, Peng Xuepei, Zhou Gengsheng, Zheng Yanfen, Zhang Daofan, Hang Liwu, Ye Gongchao, Luo Jialun, Yu Bin, Chen Daqi, He Yaozu, Chen Bosheng, Liu Yutang, Chen Bingzhang, Shao Yulin, Chen Qingyun, and Sun Guiji, were elected as 25 members of the Board of Directors. Dai Chuanxian and Yu Youren, among others, were elected as honorary directors.</p>
<p>Definition of Tasks: The articles of association of the Association define the following tasks: (1) Liaising with the General Association of Asian Relations and friendly associations in various Asian regions. (2) Handling matters entrusted by the General Association and friendly associations in various regions. (3) Conducting research to promote Asian relations. (4) Communicating with relevant groups in Asia and exchanging research materials and publications. (5) Hosting visits to China by individuals related to the General Association and friendly associations in various regions. (6) Other matters promoting the association's work. It is also understood that the association's funding will come from membership fees and donations. The association's headquarters will be located in the capital.</p>

<h3>Victory Cup Volleyball Championship; St. John's Wins Championship; Weng Chengguang, Despite Illness, Appears on Court and Recovers a Dangerous Situation</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] The St. John's University volleyball team relied on Weng Chengguang's courageous appearance on the court, despite his illness, to boost morale and defeat Yongyi three to one, winning the Victory Cup championship. The awards were presented by Watson &amp; Co. on the spot after the match, and the Victory Cup came to a successful conclusion.</p>
<p>Both teams fought with all their might in yesterday's match. St. John's had superior skills and coordination and could have easily won. However, because spiker Weng Chengguang suddenly suffered from diarrhea, he struggled to support the team. Peng Zhongquan had not fully recovered from typhoid fever, which affected his combat effectiveness considerably. Fortunately, after Yongyi tied the score at one game each, Weng Chengguang reappeared on the court despite his illness, recovering the third game from a state of decline and laying the foundation for victory.</p>
<p>The match began at 6:30 PM. John opened the scoring first but was overtaken by Yongyi. The score fluctuated between one or two points, and the tension was extreme. When John took a 20-19 lead, Yongyi tied the score at 20 each, but John still scored two consecutive points, winning the first game.</p>
<p>In the second game, Weng Chengguang gradually felt unable to support himself, and Wu Xinyun rushed to replace him. Yongyi counterattacked and took the lead. John followed closely. Yongyi fought hard and finally tied the score at 21-19.</p>
<p>In the third game, Yongyi continued to take advantage of their momentum and once led 10-5. However, because Weng Chengguang returned, the soldiers of John used their lives. Qian Jiaxiang's clever lobs, Sun Zunqiang's quick press, supplemented by Liu Yongqiang's and Weng Chengguang's spikes, chased six consecutive points. The back defenders Wu Xinyun, Ye Qingqiang, and Dong Weitao desperately saved, and finally came from behind to lead for the second time at 22-20.</p>
<p>In the final game, John became more and more courageous and always led from afar. Yongyi struggled in vain and lost the battle at 15-21, finishing as the runner-up. The lineups of the two teams are as follows:</p>
<p>St. John's</p>
<p>Hu Siqing Liu Yongqiang Yang Renzhi</p>

<h3>Wishing the Joint Annual Meeting of Ten Scientific Organizations Success</h3>
<p>The joint annual meeting of ten scientific organizations, including the China Natural Science Society, the China Science Society, and the Chinese Astronomical Society, Mathematical Society, Physical Society, Geophysical Society, Geographical Society, Meteorological Society, Zoological Society, and Genetic Society, is scheduled to be held in Beijing today. In order to promote academic research, this newspaper will give a brief introduction to the general situation of each organization. However, due to space limitations, there may be omissions. We hope readers will understand.</p>
<h3>Moving Towards the Era of Science</h3>
<p>— Lu Yudao</p>
<p>In September, there were academic conferences at the Peking Research Institute and meetings of academicians at the Academia Sinica. Following that, in October, there are joint annual meetings of various scientific organizations across the country. In the past two months, the atmosphere of science and academics has permeated the country. In the face of the extremely low political and economic pressure in our ancient and declining motherland, breathing this scientific air may clear our minds and allow us to consider, from a brand-new scientific perspective, how we can move towards a new era of science for the sake of our national destiny.</p>
<p>From a scientific point of view, there are two things that we cannot tolerate. The first is conservative feudal thinking, and the second is scattered and disorganized undertakings.</p>
<p>First, let's talk about ideology. The most prominent feature of scientific thought is continuous progress, what is called daily renewal. If we want to progress and surpass others, we must never be feudal and conservative. This idea is best elucidated by the theory of evolution, and it has been confirmed by every scientific field.</p>
<p>It seems that everyone has a bit of nostalgia, just as when we arrive at the ancient city of Jinling, everyone can't help but miss the historical sites. This kind of literati elegance is not too bad; however, the purpose of "reviewing the old" lies in "knowing the new," and the purpose of nostalgia lies in strengthening the feeling of improving the ancient motherland. This is the right way out. If nostalgia leads to sticking to the old, or even despising the new, the result will harm the motherland and push it towards the grave. This is absolutely contrary to the spirit of science. In the scientific field, today the theory of relativity has improved Newtonian mechanics, so we boldly abandon Newtonian mechanics and use relativistic mechanics; today, atomic knowledge denies Dalton's atomic theory, so we boldly no longer adhere to Dalton's atomic theory and actively intensify the study of the internal structure of the atom; even the new quantum thought, the idea of ​​wave-particle duality, the idea of ​​time-space unity, and the idea of ​​material-energy unity are ideas that are unimaginable to most of us, as long as this idea is in line with the truth, all of humanity can learn anew. This is the spirit of science; this spirit is absolutely incompatible with those who miss the former kings, curse the present for lacking the old ways, and stubbornly stick to the old ways.</p>
<p>This is in terms of ideology.</p>
<p>Secondly, another characteristic of modern science is organization, cooperation, and planning. There must be no scattering, disorganization, perfunctory following of the old ways; especially after the development of atomic research, the scientific community has fully raised the importance of teamwork. The era of individual heroes and geniuses has at least become a thing of the past in the scientific community; the future is the era of the collective. If we divide human beings into two kinds of animals, one is an animal that engages in individual activities, and the other is an animal that engages in concrete activities, then we can already see that in the near future, the human beings who engage in collective activities will view the human beings who engage in individual activities in the same way that humans view apes and monkeys - one is more advanced and the other is more backward. Recently, when scientists conduct research, even as small as a laboratory studying a problem and writing a paper, it is a collaboration of experts in mathematics, physics, and chemistry, rather than each going its own way. If this lesson is popularized to politics and society, this is the real beginning of the era of science.</p>
<p>The era is moving towards science; our own thoughts and actions must also be thoroughly reformed and create a new era and a new national destiny. Perhaps today's joint annual meeting of scientific organizations is a beginning.</p>
<h3>Overview of the China Natural Science Society</h3>
<p>The China Natural Science Society was established in 1927 and has a history of 21 years. The goals of our society can be summarized into four items: (1) to promote the popularization of science in order to enlighten the people; (2) to develop science in order to enrich the people's livelihood; (3) to seek scientific investigation in order to strengthen the foundation of the country; (4) to conduct scientific research in order to advance culture. After more than 20 years of efforts, our society has more than 2,000 members. The general office is located in Nanjing (address: Central University), and there are branches in major cities at home and abroad. The current chairman of the board of directors is Wu Youxun, and the general secretary is Shen Qiyi.</p>
<p>The work carried out by our society in recent years includes the following six items:</p>
<p>(1) *Scientific World* Journal: Founded in 1931, it has now published 17 volumes. It is the earliest comprehensive journal in our country to popularize scientific knowledge. During the difficult period of the Anti-Japanese War, this journal continued to be published in the mainland without interruption. After the restoration, it moved to Shanghai for publication. It has systematically introduced the progress of modern scientific knowledge, and has published two special issues on "Atomic Nucleus" and "Aviation." A special issue on "Radar" will be published on the Double Ten Festival to commemorate the joint annual meeting of scientific organizations.</p>
<p>(2) *Science and Technology in China* (English bimonthly): During the Anti-Japanese War in our country, transportation between the rear and overseas was blocked, and most of our country's scientific publications were suspended. Our society felt that scientific exchanges between domestic and foreign countries should not be interrupted, so it cooperated with the British Cultural Committee to have our society edit *Chinese Science* (*Acta Brevia Sinenssa*) to report on the progress of Chinese science. It was published in London by the British Cultural Committee and distributed to the British and American scientific communities. This work did not end until the end of the war. After the restoration, we believe that the progress of our country's science and construction undertakings needs to continue to be reported overseas, so we have been publishing *Science and Technology in China*, an English bimonthly journal, since January of this year. Five issues have been published. (3) Publication of *Science Abstracts and Articles from Microfilm*: In the later period of the Anti-Japanese War, our country and the coast were occupied by Japanese invaders. Foreign scientific books and publications could not be sent to China. The governments of the United Kingdom and the United States gave us scientific book films, but it was very difficult to read these films. In order to solve this difficulty, our society retyped and compiled important documents in the book films into *Science Abstracts*, which were divided into three disciplines: "Physics," "Biology," and "Engineering," for the reference of the scientific community in the rear to strengthen our country's resistance to Japan. This work ended after the victory.</p>
<p>(4) Reporting Scientific News: In today's era of rapid scientific progress, it is necessary for the people to understand scientific progress. The most effective way is to report scientific news in newspapers. After the restoration, we cooperated with the Central News Agency to start this work. Scientific news has been continuously reported in newspapers for two years, and many newspapers have published it, which has been very effective.</p>
<p>(5) Organizing Scientific Lectures in Various Places: In order to spread scientific knowledge, branches distributed throughout the country regularly organize scientific lectures, show scientific films, and publish scientific supplements to popularize scientific knowledge.</p>
<p>(6) Organizing Scientific Expedition Teams: During the Anti-Japanese War, the investigation of resources in the rear was closely related to supporting the war. In 1940, our society organized a scientific expedition team to Xikang to investigate agricultural, forestry, industrial, and mineral resources. In 1942, it organized a Northwest Scientific Expedition Team to Gansu, Ningxia, and Qinghai. The investigation reports have been drafted and sent to various parties for reference.</p>
<h3>Overview of the Chinese Genetics Society</h3>
<p>The Chinese Genetics Society was established in November 1944. During the Anti-Japanese War, most of the universities and academic institutions in the southeast moved to the rear. In 1944, the China Science Society held a joint annual meeting of seven scientific organizations in Chengdu. At that time, scholars from Chengdu and Chongqing academic institutions and universities engaged in genetics teaching and research jointly organized the Chinese Genetics Society during the joint annual meeting of the seven scientific organizations. At present, the society has more than 100 members.</p>
<h3>Overview of the Chinese Physical Society</h3>
<p>The Chinese Physical Society is an academic organization formed by Chinese physicists. It has a history of seventeen years.</p>
<p>The purpose of the Chinese Physical Society, as stated in its charter, is simply "to promote the progress and popularization of physics." Therefore, the development of society affairs is also aimed at this goal. Currently, there are four committees under the board of directors: (1) *Journal* Committee: Responsible for the editing and printing of the *Chinese Journal of Physics*. This journal is dedicated to publishing research papers by Chinese people on physics. Four volumes were published before the Anti-Japanese War. It was temporarily suspended for some time during the Anti-Japanese War. It was resumed in 1944, and three more volumes have been published since then, with two to four issues per volume. This journal is circulated abroad, and its papers are often cited. *Science Abstracts*, a monthly publication in the United Kingdom, also collects materials from the papers published in this journal. (2) Nomenclature Review Committee: Entrusted by the Ministry of Education to review the translation of physics terms. More than 1,000 terms have been reviewed and published by the Compilation and Translation Bureau, and more than 1,000 terms have been reviewed and are awaiting publication. (3) Teaching Committee: Discusses the teaching problems of physics in Chinese universities and middle schools. At this annual meeting, physics teachers from middle schools in Beijing will be invited to attend the meeting to discuss the teaching of physics in middle schools. (4) *Applied Physics Compilation* Committee: Responsible for compiling and printing in Chinese the functions of physics in application. This is an irregular publication, and the target readers are domestic middle school and university students and people who are generally interested in physics. This complements the specialized works of the *Chinese Journal of Physics* mentioned in the first item to achieve the purpose of the society to popularize physics and promote its progress.</p>
<p>In addition to the work of the society, a general meeting is held once a year. Papers are read and society affairs are discussed at the meeting. Before the Anti-Japanese War, national members gathered in one place every year, and such grand annual meetings were held five times, twice in Beijing and once each in Shanghai, Qingdao, and Nanjing. After the Anti-Japanese War, due to inconvenient transportation and difficulty in gathering, the method of holding annual meetings in separate regions was adopted, and they were held separately in Chongqing, Kunming, Chengdu, Meitan, Guilin, and other places at the same time every year. After the victory, this regional method is still adopted. This year, we are here to participate in the annual meeting of ten scientific organizations, which is limited to members in the Beijing-Shanghai-Hangzhou area. Other regional annual meetings are being held at the same time in Beijing, Xi'an, and other places. In addition to the annual meeting once a year, there are also regular group discussions and irregular lectures. The Shanghai branch is particularly enthusiastic about these two tasks.</p>
<p>The Chinese Physical Society has also represented the Chinese physics community at several World Physical Societies. This time, the World Physical Society was held in the Netherlands, and we also sent representatives to attend.</p>
<p>At present, the Chinese Physical Society has three branches: Beijing, Shanghai, and Xi'an, with a total of 560 members, 9 honorary members abroad, including the Indian physicist Raman, and 18 group members. The current chairman of the board of directors is Yan Jici, the vice chairman is Rao Yutai, the secretary is Zhou Peiyuan, and the accountant is Shi Ruwei.</p>
<h3>Overview of the Chinese Astronomical Society</h3>
<p>The Chinese Astronomical Society aims to promote the progress and popularization of astronomy. It was proposed in the early years of the Republic of China. At that time, because there were few people interested in astronomy, the formal organization was temporarily put aside. The name of the Astronomical Society was used to publish a monthly magazine to call on comrades. On October 30, 1922, it was officially established. It has been 26 years since then, and a total of 22 annual meetings have been held, with a total of 688 members. The activities it has carried out are briefly described below.</p>
<p>(1) Compiling and Translating Astronomical Books: In the early years of preparation, a periodical was first published, named *Guānxiàng Cóngbào* ("Observational Reports"), published once a month. The first issue of the first volume was published in July 1915. It was published until the third issue of the seventh volume in October 1921, when it was discontinued due to lack of printing funds. It was republished in July 1923, renamed *Guānxiàng Huìkān* ("Observational Compilation"), and soon stopped again. It was changed to an annual report, named *Bulletin of the Chinese Astronomical Society*. The first issue was published in 1924. After publishing to the eighth issue, it was changed to an irregular publication. It has now been published to the ninth issue. In July 1930, the monthly magazine was restored and renamed *Yǔzhòu* ("Universe"), which has continued to this day. It has now been published to the sixth issue of the eighteenth volume. At present, the *Bulletin* and the *Monthly* are published in parallel, and the nature of the two is slightly different. The *Bulletin* mainly publishes research papers by members of the Society, and occasionally publishes important translations; the *Monthly* mainly publishes popular astronomical works, and reports on the news of the universe. In addition, there is a *Variable Star Observation Report*, published by the Variable Star Observation Committee. There is also a *Member Newsletter*, published every six months, which specializes in publishing society news.</p>
<p>(2) Compiling and Editing Astronomical Terminology: In December 1930, the Astronomical Terminology Compilation Committee was established, with member Zhang Yuzhe in charge. In 1933, more than 1,400 terms were sent to the National Compilation and Translation Bureau for publication. The annual meeting in 1937 resolved to request the National Compilation and Translation Bureau to revise the astronomical terminology, and member Chen Zungui was responsible for it. Soon, more than 6,100 terms were obtained, which were sent by the National Compilation and Translation Bureau for mimeographing and distribution to the members of the Astronomical Terminology Compilation Committee for review. On October 31, 1942, an astronomical terminology discussion meeting was held, which determined the standards for the selection of terminology and passed the translation of each term. In 1947, the National Compilation and Translation Bureau hired a clerk to assist Mr. Chen in sorting out the terminology. The initial work has now been completed, but there are still some problems that need to be finally reviewed at this annual meeting before they can be determined. It is expected that it can be published this year.</p>
<p>(3) Observing Stars: At the third annual meeting in 1925, it was resolved to establish a Variable Star Observation Committee. However, due to various difficulties, it was not established for several years. At the seventh annual meeting in 1929, member Zhang Yun proposed the case again, and the conference resolved to establish it immediately. The committee was temporarily located in the Guangzhou National Sun Yat-sen University Observatory. The members were scattered in various places, but most of them were in Guangzhou. The members in Guangzhou borrowed the telescope of the Guangzhou National Sun Yat-sen University Observatory for observation; the members in other places borrowed the telescopes of the local observatories or prepared their own telescopes for observation. The observation results were sent to the committee for publication. The committee publishes an observation report every two months. Every two years, the observation results are compiled and published in an annual report. The report is also exchanged overseas with international academic organizations on a regular basis.</p>
<p>(4) Connecting Research: For the promotion of all scientific research, it is necessary to observe each other to encourage each other, and to help each other to increase efficiency, so that collective opinions can become systematic. The Chinese Astronomical Society also connects with all parties for research based on this purpose. For example, all domestic astronomical institutions are group members; the preparation for solar eclipse observation was initiated in 1934. Teams were formed to observe the solar eclipses in 1936 and 1941. As for the communication between the Chinese astronomical community and the international astronomical community, we also do our best. For example, members were sent to attend the second, third, and fifth sessions of the International Astronomical Union; members were also sent to participate in the astronomical group of the fourth Pacific Science Conference.</p>
<p>(5) Academic Lectures: When it was located in Beijing, there were academic lectures every month, which lasted for several years without interruption. After the association moved south, the lectures were stopped, but they were still held every year at the annual meeting or at appropriate times.</p>
<p>(6) Rewarding Astronomical Writings: Two kinds of anonymous prizes and Tanyuan prizes are established to reward astronomical writings. The anonymous prize has been awarded once in 1927 and 1933 respectively. The first purpose of the Tanyuan Prize is to subsidize the travel expenses of Chinese people attending the International Astronomical Union; if the government has officially sent personnel to attend, then this award will be used to reward research on ancient Chinese astronomy, so it has not been awarded to this day.</p>
<h3>Overview of the China Science Society</h3>
<p>The China Science Society was founded in Ithaca, USA, in 1914. It was initially named the "Science Society" and published the *Science* magazine, which has reached 30 volumes to date. In 1915, it was formally established, and the name was prefixed with "China" to give the English name: "Science Society of China." Its purpose is "to connect comrades, study academics, and jointly promote the development of science in China," and its motto is "to investigate things to gain knowledge, and to use knowledge to promote life." In 1917, it was approved by the Ministry of Education for registration. In 1920, the Science Library was established at the society's location in Wenderli, Xianxian Street, Nanjing. In 1922, the Institute of Biology was founded in Jing She. In 1929, the China Scientific Book and Instrument Company was founded on Moore Road, Shanghai, and later moved to Zhongzheng Middle Road. To this day, it is the leader of the Shanghai printing industry. In 1931, the Mingfu Library, located on Shaanxi South Road, Shanghai, was completed, and all the books were stored there. Not long after, the new building of the Nanjing Institute of Biology was also completed. In 1933, the *Science Pictorial* was founded, which has reached 14 volumes to date. In 1937, when the pirates ravaged the southeast, the general office moved west to Beibei, Sichuan. Despite the hardships and turmoil, we struggled forward. Biological research continued uninterrupted. *Science* magazine continued to be published, and three annual meetings were held. The Shanghai office relied on the Shanghai comrades and the staff who remained in the office to painstakingly protect it from harm. The Shanghai Comrades Association was particularly united and shared the new challenges. The Nanjing office was burned to the ground and sacrificed for the country. In 1945, it was approved by the Ministry of Social Affairs for registration. After the war, the Nanjing office returned, but the Institute of Biology was forced to stay in the Shanghai office because the Nanjing office's land was forcibly occupied by villains. In 1947, the Radio-Electric Experimental Institute was added. In the same year, the first annual meeting after the victory was held in Shanghai. Seven scientific organizations participated. The Science Society resolved to change the English translation to "Chinese Association for the Advancement of Science," abbreviated as "C.A.A.S." This year's 26th annual meeting will be held in six regions. The Beijing-Shanghai-Hangzhou region will jointly hold the meeting with ten scientific organizations, the North China region will jointly hold the meeting with eight scientific organizations, and the Central China region will jointly hold the meeting with five scientific organizations. The other regions, such as Northwest, Southwest, and South China, are also actively preparing for the meeting. At present, there are seven units: the general office, the editorial department, the Mingfu Library, the Institute of Biology, the *Science Pictorial* department, the Radio-Electric Experimental Institute, and the China Science Company. There are more than 3,000 members.</p>
<p>The society currently has a board of supervisors (directors), with Mr. Weng Wenhao as the chairman of the board; and a board of directors, with Mr. Ren Hongjun as the chairman of the board (i.e., the president). The staff includes a general secretary, currently held by Mr. Lu Yudao; the director of the Institute of Biology is Mr. Bing Zhi, and the director of the Science Library is concurrently held by Mr. Lu Yudao. The editor-in-chief of *Science* magazine is Mr. Zhang Mengwen, and the editor-in-chief of *Science Pictorial* is Mr. Yang Xiaoshu. The editor-in-chief of *Society Friends* is Mr. Yu Shiyuan. There are a total of twelve staff members.</p>
<h3>Overview of the Chinese Geophysical Society</h3>
<p>Geophysics is the science of studying the physical phenomena of the earth, sea, land, and air, and its applications. In order to promote the progress and popularization of this science in China, domestic workers initiated the organization of the Chinese Geophysical Society in the spring of 1947. It was formally established in August of the same year and approved by the government for registration.</p>
<p>The society currently has 54 members. The chairman of the board of directors is Chen Zongqi. It publishes the *Chinese Journal of Geophysics*, which is published twice a year. The first issue of the first volume has already been published. The journal follows the usual practice of specialized journals in various countries and publishes articles in any of the three languages: English, German, and French.</p>
<h3>Research on Chinese Geography and the Geographical Society of China</h3>
<p>— Zhang Qiyun</p>
<p>The Geographical Society of China is a national organization founded in the capital in the twenty-third year of the Republic of China. The first annual meeting was held in Lushan, Jiangxi Province, in the summer of the same year, and the "Journal" was founded at the same time, publishing profound research papers. After the outbreak of the Anti-Japanese War, the society moved west to Chongqing with the government, and the "Journal" has not been interrupted over the years. Last year's annual meeting was held in Shanghai, and this year's return to the capital is the first time since the war. At the beginning of the country's arduous creation, it is time for scholars to contribute their efforts. The members of this society are attending the meeting with a spirit of self-reflection, self-encouragement, and active progress.</p>
<p>Modern academics value specialization, and the division of labor is becoming more and more detailed, resulting in richer harvests. This society was established after the September 18th Incident. In the short span of ten years or so, after on-the-spot investigations and painstaking research by the majority of experts, in the field of geography in our country, in all departments such as natural geography, biogeography, human geography, historical geography, and geographical education, there are many brilliant flowers and beautiful fruits. Not only do people outside of this field often not pay attention to them, but even our own comrades may not be able to fully understand them. Recently, Professors Ren Meie and Xu Jiangzhi have written lengthy reports on the new gains in this period, which have been published in the "Science" magazine (Volume 30, Issue 4) and the "Journal of Geography" (Volume 14, Issues 3 and 4) respectively. Of course, what they introduced are only representative works, not the whole picture, but after reading them, we seem to see the magnificence of the river and the forest of sails, which is really exciting. The papers submitted by the comrades at this annual meeting, I believe, will be even more brilliant than in previous years. Collective efforts and mutual learning to jointly promote the progress of this field is the main significance of the society.</p>
<p>Reading about the geographical societies of various countries in the world can be roughly divided into four categories. Taking the United States as an example, the Association of American Geographers, the National Geographic Society of Washington, D.C., and the National Council for Geographic Education can be cited as examples. The Association of American Geographers, founded in 1904, is a kind of trade association. Most of its members are experts who teach at universities or work in research institutions. It publishes four volumes of the journal each year. The number of articles is not large, but the standard is extremely high. The inaugural address of the newly elected president each year is far-sighted, reflecting on the past and looking to the future, and indicating the direction of academic research. Abstracts of the papers presented at the annual meeting are also published, which can truly be called a treasure trove of literature. The New York Geographical Society, founded in 1852, is the oldest. Its membership scope is wider and is not limited to experts. It has a spacious clubhouse, a complete library, full-time staff, and a very visionary editorial plan. Its "Geographical Review" quarterly is the world's first-class forum, and the authors are authoritative scholars from all over the world. Most of the papers are specialized research and are rich in reference value. Various departments of the federal government regard this journal as essential reading, and it is of great benefit in solving major domestic, foreign, economic, and national defense issues. In addition, the society also publishes a series of books and maps, making many contributions. The "National Geographic Magazine" published by the National Geographic Society of Washington, D.C., is a monthly magazine with rich illustrations and texts. Since its founding in 1899, it has long been deeply rooted in the people. Each issue sells more than one million copies. It is truly a spiritual food that is widely read in every household. The richness of its color plates is unparalleled in the world, and it is the largest educational magazine in the world. Because of its prosperous development and abundant economy, the society has the financial resources to organize large-scale expeditions, such as the discovery of the North Pole, the investigation of glaciers, the surveying of the deep sea, and the exploration of the stratosphere, all of which have made valuable contributions to science. As for the National Council for Geographic Education, as the name implies, it is related to school education. Its "Journal of Geography" is published monthly. The content is in-depth and easy to understand. All discussions on teaching materials, teaching methods, and library equipment are constantly updated, with the aim of promoting geography teaching in primary and secondary schools.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the establishment of the Geographical Society of China, the President Weng Wenhao and the Directors Zhu Kezhen and other gentlemen did indeed have a grand vision. We wanted to take the capital as a base, gather the minds and efforts of comrades from all over the country to promote Chinese geography, so as to advance in parallel with the geographical societies of European and American countries. We once planned to raise funds, build a clubhouse, and collect books to facilitate the advancement of the society's affairs. However, due to the outbreak of the Anti-Japanese War and ten years of displacement, it was difficult to fulfill our initial wishes due to the environment. To only ask about cultivation and not about harvest is the attitude that scholars should hold. We firmly believe that if we can work diligently and concentrate our contributions, it will not be difficult to gain the appreciation and sympathy of society over time. Due to the encouragement of the government and the support of the broad masses of the people, the distant vision of that year will surely gradually become a reality. At present, the nature of this society is similar to that of the Association of American Geographers. No matter how the society's affairs develop in the future, the reading of papers and the editing of the "Journal" will ultimately be the basic tasks of a society. And the holding of the annual meeting is the key to reviewing the society's affairs and exchanging ideas, which is of utmost importance.</p>
<p>The current mailing address of the Geographical Society of China is the Department of Geography, National Central University, Nanjing. The current Chairman of the Board is Hu Huanyong, and the Secretary-General is Ren Meie.</p>
