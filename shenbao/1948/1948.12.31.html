<h3>總統定元旦發表文告　剴切說明當前時局　重大政策今可最後決定</h3>
<p>〔本報南京卅日電〕據確實可靠消息，中樞對當前局勢，將有重大決策，現正詳密考慮中，卅一日可能作最後決定，其方式或由蔣總統發表文告，說明政府企求和平之一貫主張，並指出癥結所在，藉以澄淸時局，安定人心。此項決定係由於邇來時局動盪，京·滬謠諑頻傳，雖均證明無事實之根據，然當其傳播時，則顯然發生若干影響，尤其閻錫山·胡宗南·盧漢抵京，宋子文，傅作義等將來京之消息傳出後，各方對於地方重要首長之會集南京，咸予最大之關心與注視。據悉：蔣總統電召閻·胡·盧·宋·傅等來京目的，為諮詢對當前局勢之意見，西北軍政長官張治中，原定卅日由京返蘭，亦經總統挽留。孫科戰時內閣之中心人物，包括張羣·陳立夫·吳鐵城等亦均參與此項集會，卅日竟日彼等接觸頻繁，晚復在總統官邸會商，聞總統於聽取中樞及地方各首長之意見後，對今後決策已漸趨具體化，卅一日繼續磋商後，卽可作最後決定，而於新年期間昭告全國。就目前所知，外傳總統退休之說，絕非事實，有謂某國人士希望總統退休以求和者，更屬無稽之談。被傳說之某國人士，已向有關方面鄭重否認其事，而蔣總統自承繼孫總理領導革命以來，向未顧及其個人之進退，而無時不以全國人民之利益為念，故所作所為，亦以人民之利益為依歸，總統職位，係經人民選出者，非經人民允許，斷不能萌退休之念，勝利復員後，開政治協商會議與共黨和談，全係尊重人民之意見，及至政協失敗，商談無望，共黨擴大武裝叛亂，政府明令戡平匪患，亦係為拯人民於水火，奠國基於永安，今後大計，仍當取決於人民，蔣總統個人及政府企求和平，早具一貫信心，祗以共黨稱兵作亂，致不得不忍痛進行軍事戡亂，以期早日獲得和平，如共黨能停止叛亂，解甲休兵，政府自當予以寬容，研討共處之道，惟目前之和謠，乃係若干所謂「中間人士」之主觀意見，共黨方面並無反響，更非共黨方面之意見，故今後大局發展，全以共黨是否覺悟為斷，蔣總統元旦發表之文告，或將就此剴切說明，俾共黨知其過去之非，翻然改圖，則全國人民將可避免塗炭之命運，否則政府仍當繼續努力戡平匪亂，斷不能置人民於水深火熱中而不之顧。至軍事方面，政府仍有把握扭轉局勢，况目前已現契機，不必全恃外援，政府卽可穩操左券，使共黨憬悟其不顧民心而憑恃武力之一意孤行，終必趨於失敗毀滅之途。</p>

<h3>空軍副總司令　王叔銘一席談　徐蚌戰中空軍發揮最大威力强調全體將士挽救狂瀾決心</h3>
<p>〔本報南京卅日電〕空軍副總司令王叔銘，今日冒雨在機塲中經記者一再邀請，始與記者談空軍在徐蚌大戰之作業稱：（一）由於匪勢猖獗，空軍不能不發揮高度機能以挽狂瀾，故地面戰鬥最烈之處，如碾莊·雙堆集。靑龍集，亦卽空軍集中火力攻擊匪軍之處，匪軍行動部隊一經發現，卽立成殘缺肢體，此項戰果數字，空軍不欲加以估計，匪軍迄今遲遲不能發動渡淮攻江戰事，可以於此尋得因素。（二）有一戰鬥事例可資引證：本月七日拂曉，正當劉·陳匪部在津浦路西側雙堆集及青龍集與國軍黃維及杜聿明部對壘時，陳毅匪部遣出一萬餘人之一股，繞至津浦東側盱眙縣河梢橋偷渡淮河南下，擬襲蚌埠以南之後方，當時有木船二百隻，忙於兩岸裝匪南渡，兩岸沙灘及蘆葦中亦遍集匪軍人員及騾馬，架子車等輜重，因七日前夜，氣候異常惡劣，在匪以為可以瞞過空軍之眼而乘隙偷渡，不意次日拂曉，卽為吳國樑分隊長單機發現，彼一面以無綫電報告匪情，一面俯衝炸射，當時余據其報告，立派出各型飛機約五十架，飛集河梢橋阻擊，截至下午，匪軍全部殲滅，河面破舟漂流，兩岸蘆叢盡毀，匪逃逸者最多數百名而已。此偷襲後方之匪部，如當時不予消滅，則匪竄到明光，切斷蚌埠後路，再乘機增調匪部湧集南下，可能早使江淮之間形勢變異。（三）今日接杜聿明副總司令來電云：據俘匪供：「指導員說的，倘若不是劉先生到濟南養病，情勢不致弄成今日這般的壞」。證以今日匪方於淮北戰後之消沉態勢，可能匪方內部已發生若干重大事故，匪軍死傷慘重固為其端，劉伯承被炸斃可能為其中之要者。地面情報謂；「十二月十四日，劉伯承指揮所在雙堆集戰烈時，由孫疇集向蘄縣集移動」。移動路程必經桃園集，十二月五日起，空軍巳封鎖了雙堆集外圍全部大路小徑，十二日起，對外圍匪軍所據村落實施毀滅轟炸，十四日並派出C24型機集中轟炸桃園集，倘劉匪果被炸死，則定為當日C24型機之戰果。王氏末强調空軍全體對挽救狂瀾之決心及效忠總統之堅決意志，認為目下倡和者之「屈膝政略」，將使軍力受害遠甚於匪方所加之打擊，甚望局勢早日澄淸。</p>
<h3>塘大國軍展開追擊　海河北岸據點先後收復　平郊匪主力已遠引·津南昨有接觸</h3>
<p>〔中央社北平卅日電〕華北剿總發表：塘大地區國軍兵力雄厚，工事堅強，匪以無隙可乘，廿九日拂曉，紛紛逃退，國軍武騎部隊配合水上部隊，當卽展展開追撃，迄午後三時，將沿海河北岸據點西廠·京奉材料廠。趙家廠及新河均先後收復，西大沽部隊正與塘沽之出撃部隊南北呼應，沿海河兩岸向西搜進中。</p>
<p>〔中央社天津卅日電〕津警備部發表：塘沽以西之新河現已證實確爲國軍收復。</p>
<p>〔本報天津廿九日電〕津·塘外圍匪調動頻仍，先後已發現林彪一·二·四·六·七·八·九，十等縱隊，其主力大部集結津塘之綫以北地區，津外圍目前尙無全面劇戰跡象。塘沽廿九日無戰鬥，外圍匪第七縱隊正向楊村流竄，廿九日晨，國軍曾予追擊·匪二縱隊仍在塘沽外圍整理工事，大沽以南匪第九縱隊於國軍之海軍砲火制壓下，亦向西南方向撤退，一部竄抵津南，廿九日晨於津南李七莊與國軍發生接觸，國軍發砲猛轟，市內淸晰可聞，午間匪不支後退。津北宜興埠有匪數千人盤據，津東貫兒莊為匪第八縱隊盤據。</p>
<p>〔本報北平卅日電〕新歲在邇，故都戰氛漸淡，週邊林匪主力似已遠引他方，遠郊飛機炸射與午夜鎗砲聲雖不時仍可傳入耳鼓，市民習以為常，不復驚恐，且咸信傅總司令必能保衛故都安全。平城防工事經兩週趕修，業巳完成，城週無大妨碍之房屋墳墓樹木，已奉令停止拆除，城內秩序恢復常態，西城軍隊佔用民房逐漸移出，通衢行人無復擁擠怱忙景象，水電方面經當局設法，運用雖未全恢復，但大驚慌已不存在。</p>

<p>此空軍人士，首以堅決語氣稱：「我負責說，杜聿明所部在蕭永地區靑龍集，陳官莊所起的作用，不是京滬後方人士所能了解的。邱清泉·李彌兩兵團，目下官兵士氣很堅定，生活雖然慘苦，他們到底是十多年的老部隊，決不會瓦解，而且必可負荷他們在整個江淮戰塲上的重任」。</p>
<p>記者詢以杜氏所部人數時，渠以肯定語氣稱：「現有廿四萬人，裝備齊全」。</p>
<p>以下均為某軍官的話。這一個大兵團為何從徐州南下攻匪之背，而成今日駐屯蕭永地區廿餘日之久？今後動向如何？作用如何？這都不是報紙所能揭露的事，這是國共雙方部隊氣質·習慣·戰略·戰術等特性相繫而成混擬團。有一點很重要，除非自垮，這麼大的裝備齊全兵團決不會被目下力量單薄的匪方吃掉，以杜氏的將材，佐以邱·李，決不會自潰。</p>
<p>杜部駐地面積並不太大，村落房屋不多，士兵多在戰壕中露宿，幸有空投彈藥所用之降落傘被士兵撐用庇寒，近日大雪，得免雪侵入致死。</p>
<p>官兵彈藥不缺，最初十日，挖掘民糧充飢，空投糧食後，糧源解決，但廿公斤及四十公斤一包之米袋紛落時，每日約打死擊傷官兵三四十人。匪方最初十日，每天發砲千餘發到駐地圈內，其後十日中，每日僅有百十發砲彈射入，砲彈毀傷力很小，匪軍在縱深戰壕內圍着國軍，全採心理戰術，砲彈發射僅如點綴。</p>
<p>相對喊話猶如演劇</p>
<p>其心理戰術具體表現為喊話，國軍方面亦由士兵訕答，例如：</p>
<p>匪軍；「你們過來罷，沒吃的還打什麼？別吃苦」！</p>
<p>國軍：「誰說的，我們有空投」！</p>
<p>匪軍：「空投什麼東西」？</p>
<p>國軍：「罐頭牛肉，大餅，麵包，你聽罐頭响聲」！士兵敲空罐頭聲。</p>
<p>匪軍應聲似甚羨慕。</p>
<p>另一喊話例；</p>
<p>匪軍敲鑼打鼓，引起國軍注意，高喊：「快過來罷，這裏有烤豬吃」！匪軍用鞭打豬，豬叫，突然這一豬奔出越戰壕到達國軍陣地，被國軍按住。</p>
<p>國軍：「哈哈，你們的豬投奔過來了，你們也來罷」。</p>
<p>匪方沮喪無聲。這一隻豬成為七十二軍參謀長生日的禮品。</p>
<p>慘苦情况彼此無異</p>
<p>戰地夜時，雙方互有逃兵數十名，向對方逃走，雙方所派間諜亦雜於逃兵中去探敵情，國軍方面五色繽紛的降落傘所支撑的蓬，如市塲，如蒙古包，其下的士兵，臥戰壕日復一日，雜有傷兵及產子之軍眷產婦哼聲，使地獄浮現於提馬燈的查夜者。眼前匪方逃降者，亦述及匪方慘况：數十天臥於戰壕內，日食粥一二碗，乃卅里外匪逼老百姓送來者，匪不飽百姓喊苦，最初共方十五個縱隊來包圍，經過廿七天對持後，匪方死傷逃病十萬人，現只有九個縱隊番號的殘部在伴守着。</p>
<p>香烟一支價二百元</p>
<p>該軍官并稱：社聿明將軍未受彈傷，體健如恒，對飛來共艱苦之空軍，親切如弟兄，給予棉鞋，棉被，大衣為之禦寒，暇時常與此空軍將領及醫務處長等作橋牌戯，不斷以京滬慰勞的香烟供此空軍，戰地香烟每支價二百元，吸一口十元，有癮無錢者常有四五人圍住一有烟吸者而等其烟尾之享受。邱淸泉，李彌等以下諸將領，均全部安全，僅師長二名受有彈傷，官兵傷者均亟盼空投盤尼西林等藥品，更盼香烟。由於燃料缺乏，投糧亟宜改投到手可食之大餅·麵包·</p>

<h3>矚望台灣的新政</h3>
<p>正當各地將星雲集首都之際，行政院爲加強地方行政，配合總體戰起見，通過任命秦德純繼長山東省，陳誠繼長台灣省，這是萬分值得注意的一件措施。秦德純將軍魯人也，中央任命秦氏出長山東，說明政府決不放棄山東，并有收復山東失地之意；陳誠將軍精通韜略，為當代顯名的軍事家政治家，中央任命陳氏出長台灣，說明政府對台灣地方之重視，并將充分發揮台灣人力物力，進行經濟建設，支撑對共戰爭。吾人重視今後之台灣，爰於陳氏膺奉新命之日，略抒對今後台灣之願望。</p>
<p>台灣為目前我國最安定靖平之一省，其政治經濟地位，深為舉世所注目。從地理上說，台灣位於東海與南海之間，其著名島嶼有三部：台灣本島，澎湖列島，及新南羣島，合而稱之曰台灣省。東瞰太平洋，西望福建省，東北接琉球羣島，南與菲律賓相對，形勢異常險要。土地面積有三萬五千九百六十一方公里，人口約六百六十餘萬人，現在京滬疏散台灣之機關工廠日多，人口已達七百萬人以上，且有繼續增加之象。台省土地肥沃，物產豐隆，中型工業組織農業組合，早建有堅實基礎，可惜光復後三年多來，對於人力地利與物產，未能充分發揮，致有閉關自守之譏。事實上，台灣省為中國之一環，它同本土內地的關係，如唇齒的關係，時別是與華南諸省的關係最感密切；故今後台灣一切建設準備，如何加强對華南各省之聯緊，如何以本土內地人力技術，發揮該省人力地利與物產，實為今後台灣省施政之重要課題。</p>
<p>昔人治理台灣最著成績而彪炳史乘者，當推鄭成功父子兩代民族英雄。明將鄭成功曾擊敗荷蘭人光復台灣，以台灣為復興大明的根據地。成功父子治台凡二十三年，奠下了建設的基礎，提高了民族精神，雖其後遭受日本侵略，失守了台灣，可是民族意識與復國精神，巳生根於台灣人民。日本統治台灣五十一年，而台灣人民的革命運動，未嘗有一天的間歇，直到日本戰敗投降，台灣人民的革命運動，𦆵配合國軍受降而揚眉吐氣。現在國事紛亂，大江以北一片烽火，唯有台灣三島屹立東海南海之間，故如何發揚鄭成功父子的民族精神，以台灣為復興中土的根據，當是一件很富有歷史意義的事。</p>
<p>吾人重視台灣的重要，珍視台灣歷史意義之重大，自然對今後台灣政治經濟建設，抱了無窮的熱望，希冀陳誠將軍一本苦幹，實幹，硬幹精神，以新的作風，推行新的政策，一掃往昔地方行政泄泄沓沓之積習，把台灣建設為新的台灣，并進而發揚台灣精神，以支撑今日民族國家所處的危局。孟子說：「今滕絕長補短，將五十里也，猶可以為善國」。何况今日的台灣，物產豐隆，人口繁榮，一切工業農業組織已經建立穩固的基礎，以新的作風治理台灣，建設台灣，把台灣帶向進步，走向光明，當是一樁必然的事，而且是陳氏有勇可為的事。吾人欣聞陳氏主台意義之重大，因而對于台灣也抱着無窮的希望，願陳氏痛認時艱，努力以赴，早日以新的事實，解答於台灣省內外的人士。</p>

<h3>鎮靖邊區一瞥　蠻地變成匪共巢穴當局亟應密切注視</h3>
<p>— 本報特約記者　梁雨山</p>
<p>〔本報桂林廿四日訊〕僻處西南邊陲的靖西·鎭邊·兩縣，一向是默默無聞，連年烽火，許多窮鄉僻壤都變了熱鬧的市塲，抗戰期間，敵寇鐵蹄所至，逼使一羣羣人流向西南一帶，勝利後，共匪倡亂，靖西·鎭邊成了匪的流竄地，「鎭靖邊區」便開始為人們所注目了。</p>
<p>石山險峻匪共盤踞</p>
<p>鎭邊·靖西·兩縣位置緊接，為桂省西南的突出地帶，上接雲南，下連本省龍州·憑祥，而與越南毗連，沿下雷土州一帶至思樂，與越境立有界碑二〇七塊，兩方界綫長一九〇一里，至鎭靖兩縣之汎地，有百南汎距越保樂汎九〇里，平孟汎距越朔江汎八里，隴邦汎距越茶嶺汎二五里，同理兩國邊務。鎭靖為四百多尺高之邱陵地帶，邊緣無良好之天然屏障，境內復多石山，土人依山而居，四面石山底下便聚成一所所村落。各村之間，鷄犬不相聞。由於地勢的險惡，容易招致匪類的潛聚。去年冬天，至今年二月間，共匪勾結土匪盤踞平孟·弄銀·百南，面良·果樂各鄉，官來匪去，匪曾憑恃地勢，為非作歹，由來已久。</p>
<p>鎮邊·靖西，在唐時為蠻地，迄淸代仍為土司。雍正五年，改土歸流，屬鎮安府。光緒十三年，靖西改歸順直隸州，鎭邊亦改為所屬之鎭安縣。至民國廢州設縣，以其名不雅馴，乃有今名。光緒十一年中法之役，淸廷以戰勝國割地媾和，我與越南千餘年來之主屬關係從此斷絕，鎭邊·靖西·也就成為了國防重地。</p>
<p>上架睡人下架養猪</p>
<p>靖西一縣，面積一〇，九七六方里。人口廿四萬餘人。鎭邊較小，面積八，七二一方里，人口八萬餘人，其中以鎭邊一地尙有千餘苗榣特族人，大部皆已同化，卽少數之苗徭民族，外表上亦與漢人無異，僅服飾上仍保留着他們的特色。上衣領間，只有圓圓一個領口，沒有高起的領邊，衣和褲上裝飾着粗綫條的斜形條紋。</p>
<p>邊民生活，異常刻苦，住屋簡陋得像一鋪架床，上架睡人，下架卽為猪牛欄槽，穢氣冲天，他們就好像「入鮑魚之肆」，已經慣於這種簡陋的生活。那裏土地磽瘠荒凉，產米很少，多靠雜糧維持生活，山野間多種玉米（卽栗），每年玉米收穫，足供他們半年糧食，所以每年秋收過後，他們的一切希望，便都寄托於此物身上。雜糧中另有一種特產，名呌薏苡。薏苡，越南人呼為「簳珠」，他們多以此代米，或雜於米中煮之。</p>
<p>食米得薏澀中帶甜</p>
<p>他們的歌謠裏有這樣兩句：「食米得薏，薏一米二，從郎二米，儂只一薏。」又有：「郎是簳珠兒，儂是薏珠子，自憐同是珠，甘苦長相似。」這遺傳已久的生活寫實民謠，十足表現了他們的生活情形，他們的生活是苦澀中間夾着甘味。男女之間，也很開通，尤其那些年靑姑娘，更覺熱情奔放，勞動之餘，三五成羣，休憇山間林下，倆倆對答，此唱彼酬，唱出他們蘊藏深心的情話。男的多唱一些調情與傾慕的話，女的則答以勉勵言詞，這裏是他們的幾句唱答：「小口娥眉瓜子臉，誰人看了不愛他？」（男）「日頭正了又向西，還不回去怎交差？」（女）配着他們「啊唉！」的俗曲，也頗悅耳。在邊地，這些歌劇式的塲面，是不難看到。男女間發生較深的感情後，便互有饋送，禮物却非常樸素，普通男子多送手巾，布料，女子多送她親手做就的布鞋。一個美麗的姑娘，她愛慕的對象，是一個外來的靑年，她們狠單純的愛慕他們有知識，讀過書。</p>
<p>邊民敎育漸見進步</p>
<p>邊民的敎育程度，當時比較內地落後，事實上，由於政府的鼓勵邊民求學及鼓勵師資到邊區去的結果，邊民敎育，近年巳大見進步。就靖西一縣學生人數計算：目前在廣西大學就讀者己逾二十人，南寗師範學院有十餘人，在廣西省立醫學院者也有幾人。以他們的環境而論，這些數目，也算很難得的了。</p>
<p>毛匪越匪相互呼應</p>
<p>目前，在此邊區中，有比敎育更值得重視的問題，越共胡志明股，最近因被法軍所壓迫，竄匿越邊河陽鄉村岳地帶，另股則以保樂屬商弄為根據地。毛匪所部項英及李濟琛所指揮之匪軍，包括「滇黔桂邊區人民自救軍」朱嘉弼股，和「滇越邊區人民解放軍」，「靖鎭人民解放軍」等，刻亦竄踞同文保樂各處山地，與越匪互相呼應，壓迫邊民參軍，從事整補訓練，一面施行毒化政策，强迫邊民大量種植鴉片，致靖西一縣，巳成為「黑貨」的淵藪和犯罪者的伊甸園，影響所及，左右江至西江一條橫貫桂省大河流，遍佈着烟鬼的足跡。匪一面改變過去殘殺作風，而行懷柔政策，欺愚邊民，利用土共，在中越邊境各鄉村，表面「武裝掩護秋收」，實則滿足其搶刦糧食之野心，邊民至此，生活已不復像從前那樣愜意了。</p>
<p>河陽同文一地，係苗民所居，他們自稱「河陽省同文州」，自成一個獨立的部落，名義上雖屬桂省管轄，實際上則為另一小天地，地方雖小，却被匪利用為潛伏滋長的巢穴。政府要拯救邊民，要防禦邊防，務必及早注意，萬勿任其坐大。</p>
<h3>西康兩大工作　肅毒清匪　安定後方支援前綫</h3>
<p>— 本報特約記者　徐仁常</p>
<p>〔本報雅安廿二日航訊〕在全國戒嚴例外的西康，看起來要比其他省份安靜得多，境內沒有類似土共的股匪盤據或擾害，人民除了受物價一點威脅而外，大體都還沒有好大的動盪，在這種情形下，與那些兵荒馬亂的省份相比，似乎可算為一個「世外桃源」的樂土了。西康在今天能够有這樣的安定，可以說實在不容易，但是這安定工作還不够，還不曾達到理想的境地，尙有待於進一步的努力，這是康省當局所應特別注意的事。</p>
<p>肅清烟毒</p>
<p>這是西康現在求安定最重要的工作，因為境內高山重疊，綿延不絕，漢人們近年來為了物價的高漲，生活所逼，從前在山上採藥或種農作物為生的那一羣，不能不另想出路，向厚利的方向去冒險。他們這一羣貧苦的老百姓，也就在與鄰省交界的高山上，為人所不易走到的地方，另闢新路，在荒山上，開出火地，偷種烟苗，施以肥料，到第二年割取，所獲得的利，是十倍於採藥與務農的所得。</p>
<p>偷種烟苗</p>
<p>除這些為生活所逼冒險偷種的人而外，有錢能生活的人，也幹這個勾當的，這種人大半是社會有惡勢力的人物，以哥老的號召，在地方上擁有相當的武力，平時作威作福，欺壓人民，結交官府，他們在人民與官府的中間，要弄一切，以少數的資金，利用其所左右的愚弱小百姓，替他們做出偷種烟苗的事，到最後，在不勞苦中，遂可獲得一筆大大的數字來。這種人在這廣大的人羣裏，處處都有，此外還有一種偷烟苗的人，是以仇殺或械鬥為幌子，本來在這民情特殊的西康境內，人民與人民之間，每每私怨最深，因一小事，動輒各集人槍若干，彼此械鬥一塲，演出流血的大悲劇，或則各據某一要津，彼此警戒，作自衛性的示威，在此種情形下，各人在所據區域內，也就偷種烟苗，坐收其利。如天全，實興，蘆山，丹巴等縣，卽有此種現象發生，假如政府派軍隊前往鏟除的話，他們故意捏造其詞，謂政府對私仇的械門有所偏袒係幫助對方而來的，遂不惜一切犧牲，以武裝抵抗，保護烟苗的長成。</p>
<p>剷苗困難</p>
<p>夷區的烟苗，每年的剷除工作，沒有澈底，這是無容諱言的。自夷區在很早很早以前種烟以來，就是經過最嚴最澈底辦理禁政的其他年代裏，都沒有肅淸過。因為這些夷人，都是未歸化之民，對政府的法令，從來卽未服從，假如你要澈底剷除，必糾合各夷人，不但抗剷，且傾巢向漢人區域侵犯掠刧，反而造成不可收拾的大亂子。這種禁政是與夷務發生相當的關係，決非漢區所可比擬的。</p>
<p>在偷種烟苗的地方，一到割取烟汁的時候，外面圖利的人們，以米布等去掉換，並且還有偷運違禁物品，如子彈槍枝這類東西與種苗的人換取，於是種烟地方的私人武力一天一天的加多，又加以那些販烟的人，大半為社會上一種不怕事的人物，也就成為流氓匪類作惡的淵藪。對社會的秩序，當然要發生相當影響，尤其夷區完全是要槍彈白銀才能換買得來。那些東西一流入夷區，不消說是一種最可怕的不奸現象，自然增加了解決夷務問題上的困難。</p>
<p>互爲困果</p>
<p>康省當局對烟與匪及烟與夷務方面的不可分割的問題，費了相當苦心，因為要澈底肅淸土匪，就須嚴格禁種烟毒，才能免不肖份子的流連，同時要澈底禁絕烟毒，就須肅淸不肖份子的匪類，以免惡勢力從中作祟。要解決夷務，就須禁絕烟毒，免有外力的支持，要禁毒澈底，亦須把夷務問題解決，法令能深入，始可奏效。這些互為因果的問題，實在太不單純了。卅五六年之間，當局曾以最大的努力，不惜犧牲一切，為澈底剷除烟苗，而發生天榮事件，在當時不識內情者，認為民變，其實何嘗是民變，實際是為抗剷而演出流血的事實而已。又如剿辦普雄野夷，是解決夷務問題之一，又何嘗是夷人反叛的戰爭呢？</p>
<p>永久安定</p>
<p>今年因前方戡亂戰事緊急，有些不肖份子，乘這動盪的局勢，又在想偷偷的做那種偷種烟苗的勾當來了，可是，康省當局為了加强後方的安定工作，保持社會安寗，以增加前方戡亂的力量，肅毒與淸匪也就為當前重要的任務，經令飭寗屬屯委會副主任委員袁品文及駐軍的伍培英，以及雅屬駐軍的劉元宣及王治人等負責辦理，現在這兩屬的負責人，已分別召集各縣縣長及參議會正副議長與駐縣的軍官開了一次會議，而其最終的原則，卽是省與省間，縣與縣間切實的聯繫，澈底辦理，要大家軍政民方面合作，上下一致，使沒有一株烟苗出現，也不使有一個土匪存在，把任務達成，將這世外桃源的西康，長久地安定下去。</p>

<h3>國行拋出鉅額外匯　市面銀根已告緊俏</h3>
<p>據關係方面訊，前日中央銀行，一日間在市塲所拋結匯證，估計當在美金十二萬元以上，昨日又暗中委托中交兩行拋售六十萬美元，此爲改幣來歷所朱見之現象，各方對此，異常矚目。</p>
<p>央行僑匯結算牌價，昨市第十二次調整為每美元合金圓一一〇元，又高十元。外匯移轉證開市疲軟，行局進一一四元，出一一五元，指定銀行為一〇九元，出一一〇元。市供多求少之局，價趨下游。午市進價一〇三元，出一〇五元。</p>
<p>鬆濫已久之本市銀根，日來由於物價狂升，各業需求股切，而中央銀行抽縮游資，回收頭寸，已近一億元以上，故昨日走勢，已告緊俏。市塲拆息，最高昂達日拆五十元，大致均做四十元，或四十五元。與前日比較，提升達一倍，殊堪驚人。業內紛紛催還放款，此使市間週轉，加倍困窒，預料今日緊勢，必將愈甚。</p>
<p>現鈔籌碼，昨日亦感緊歛，因行莊前日缺單普遍，以致存放中央銀行餘額，轉見稀少，昨日無法提現，而年關在卽，工商業下半月份員工薪給年終獎金，發放密邇，需款甚多。聞一般現鈔，亦有貼水，行莊重復限制提現，約在五百元或一千元不等。聞過關頭寸，市間有出六十元或七十元搜求者。</p>
<h3>銀根緊人心虛　食米展開跌風　麵粉疾降雜糧食油猛挫</h3>
<p>昨日米市，轉見回跌，因其他各物已跌之於先，人心亦轉疲軟，加之年底，銀根甚緊，納胃頗懈，早市交易較多，價卽降低二三十元，（較上日臨收喊價降近百元），中市交易卽見稀落，白粳為六百七十元，薄稻六百八十元，早稻六百六十元，收市因去路更呆，再見下降，照上述價再减低二三十元，薄稻收市六百五十元，較上日收市價降六七十元，較上日收市後喊價降一百餘元，北市塲情形亦同，昨日到貨南北二市祗八千三百五十三石。</p>
<p>麵粉</p>
<p>市勢疾瀉，因恢復存兌黃金，人心轉定，業外各物猛跌，貨主乘高脫手，市上頓聞一片賣出聲，老車粉開市二八五元，後再低至二七二元收市，猛降八十七元。兵船粉收市二六二元，猛跌九十三元，雜牌粉均於後市開出，價一致降八九十元，麩皮亦跟縱下跌，亦狂降四十七元。</p>
<p>雜糧</p>
<p>一致狂落，因各物均見回風，存兌黃金決恢復，人心穩定，貨主乘高價吐售，漢口乍豆直瀉至三百七十元，猛挫一百八十元，，苞米出多進少，下降近百元，紅糧亦狂落一百兀，尙少納戶。菉豆疾降五成，芝蔴亦猛挫二三百元，生仁客帮不取，本銷呆滯，下跌四百元。</p>
<p>食油</p>
<p>跌風猛烈，因存兌黃金恢復，業外物價下跌，加以年終結帳，銀根突緊，貨主紛紛求脫，豆油廠方亦有開出，最高二千三百，收市二千一百五十元，生菜油退入二千元內，以一千九百五十元收市，各猛降四百元。吉桶生油收市低至二千元關，小車蔴油亦見猛跌，豆餅出多進少，下降四十七元，生仁記餅現貨一百五十三元。</p>
<h3>行莊增資移存統限今日備騐</h3>
<p>行莊增資問題，財部已作最後決定，卽現金部份仍照移存，隨時可動用，惟須經金管局核准。頃悉：銀行公會，曾於廿九日召集會議，決定遵照法令辦理，昨晨以緊急通告，分致各會員行莊。以行莊增資，現金部分繳存中央銀行之事，頃奉財政部快電，應於十二月卅一日前，如數移存中央銀行備騐。至動用事宜，政府決予合理之寬大變通辦法，現正商議中，明年初卽可公怖。</p>
<p>記者頃就行莊移存增資部分現金事，訪詢業內權威人士。據告：此舉表示政府已對銀錢業之請求，決予讓步，移存備騐，不過一例行手續而已。預料明正開關，必可動用。而行莊當局，對於增資現金，早有準備，故並不影饗業內頭寸云。</p>
<h3>銀錢業票據交換今日延長一小時　交換所規定六項辦法</h3>

<h3>錢莊小額貸款五日開始貸放</h3>
<p>本市錢莊合組小額信用貸款銀團，鑒於小工商業需要該團貸款之殷切，業經增集基金，決定元月五日開放貸款。一本扶植小工商業之素旨，繼續努力為社會服務。並聞每戶申請貸款暫以金圓券一千五百元為限，分三期拔還。</p>
<h3>台碱調整價格</h3>
<p>台灣碱業公司息：該公司於台省設有四廠，兩廠設台灣高雄草衙街四二四號，兩廠設台南安平路一〇〇一號。現每月產量在六百噸左右，供台糖公司五分之三，其餘外銷·來滬配售者，有產品金鋼鑽　牌，今改價每桶一六三九一元，燈塔牌每桶一四六九三元。凡本市紙廠，紗廠等，如有正當需用者，均可向該廠駐滬辦事處抉洽。</p>
<h3>捲烟回挫二成</h3>
<p>捲烟市况，因聞兌金仍將辦理，銀根勢將趨俏，浮多且以行莊停業數天，拆息不堪負担，拋吐甚勁，納胃較呆，市勢突然暴落，臨收稍見平穩。茄力克較昨跌四十元，為一百二十元，三五亦跌三十五元為二百十元。</p>
<h3>蘇煤斤運來滬</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕昨據美邦輪船公司消息，現有希輪柯尼斯巧號，自海參崴運來煤九千四百五十噸，約後日返蘇。</p>
<h3>出口綠茶一批已正式成交　每公斤九角五分美金</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕據出口業方面透露：我國茶葉之出口，因法國經濟代表團來華為法屬北非採購之故，巳趨活躍。採購量共為五百噸，全屬綠茶，每公斤作價美金九角五分，由上海各茶葉出口商聯合供應，現已正式成交，將於明年開關後裝船出口，故日來茶葉行情轉佳，因滬上茶葉存貨不多，此批交易成功後，存貨己大部出淸。</p>
<p>又訊：紅綠茶自執戶鑒於隔日圈外各物突飛猛晋後，影響複製成本，同時又因茶存稀少，故雖在銀根趨緊，市塲拆息步昂中，但並不稍受束縛，態度咸萌扳守，喊價狂跳，是以趨勢上挺，價格方面益發驚人。交易則以供源滯狹，卒僅寥寥數開。</p>
<h3>買氣不旺交易清閒　棉紗布一致下游　四二支藍鳳跌三千五百元</h3>
<p>昨日紗市止漲回跌，自二十日以來，漲風勢如破竹，終達空前未有之新高峯，此雖由於銀根鬆濫，然不無乘機高抬之嫌，但居高思危，物極必反，故昨日各紗一致下游。</p>
<p>四二支藍鳳由三三〇〇〇元之低檔開出，中途逢低搜羅者尙衆，收市乃俏至三六五〇〇元，較前跌三五〇〇元。四〇支藍鳳挫四三〇〇元，三二支銀月初開二七五〇〇元，一度曾見三〇五〇〇元，最後回至三〇〇〇〇元結局。</p>
<p>二一支雙馬現貨始做二六五〇〇元，至二三五〇〇元為最低，終為二四五〇〇，乹小四〇〇〇元，廠單降三〇〇〇元，以二三〇〇〇元收市，套利一天期做七〇〇元。二〇支雙馬二二五〇〇元，終挫三〇〇〇元，一六支光明與童子軍，各跌二〇〇〇元至三〇〇〇元。</p>
<p>棉布一致狂瀉，乃聞黃金將恢復存兌，以及市上銀根轉緊，且時值歲尾，市塲方面今日起休業五天，故賣買雙方均具戒心，大戶散戶皆屬審愼持重，塲內交易淸閒。</p>
<p>初開龍頭細布九〇〇元，四君子元嗶嘰八五〇元，嗣以多頭寸者逢低搜吸，市勢一激而轉挺，價微見回落，最後前者以九六〇元收市，後者九〇〇元收市，結果較前疾退二〇〇元至二五〇元不等，四君子元直質由八七〇元升至九三〇元為最高，收市為九一〇元，終挫二四〇元，其他各布廠盤雖見開低，但做開不多。</p>
<h3>中紡拋售紗布　售紗得款達四百萬金圓</h3>
<p>中紡昨代美援花紗布聯營處售紗，四二支雙股藍鳳一〇六件，每件三七〇〇〇元，共計價款三九二二〇〇〇元。又代央行售紗二種，共售出三四件，金額為七三一〇〇〇元，計二〇支紗金城二一五〇〇元，二〇支吉象二一五〇〇元。</p>

<h3>糖市回瀉</h3>
<p>食糖昨市台糖公司代國行開售特種砂白，業內銀根又緊，更以暴漲過鉅，人心居高思危，而業外各物大勢普軟，浮多獲利紛了，脚地虛軟。45號車白精以一一〇〇元軟檔開市後，中間一路下游，直至收市，以一〇五〇元結束，猛瀉四〇〇元，粗砂跌落三九〇元，生餘各檔均跌落四百元左右。</p>
<h3>木材脚地轉軟</h3>
<p>木材漲風告戢，三夾板開始下挫，三六尺開四二元，三七尺開五〇元，各跌十餘元。洋松及松板等均站定，僅杉木條子，一以皮球作用，二因門售繁用品，市况仍堅，開盤曾見三元五角，中途以三元三角，三元二角有成交。惟據業內觀測，木材脚地將轉軟化。</p>

<p>又我國與日本之易貨業務，亦將自明年度起放寬限制，使業務範圍能籍此擴展云。</p>
<h3>絲綢挫跌</h3>
<p>人絲昨日市况續見挫小，業外各物續回，市上銀根突緊，暗息回高，更以新曆年關銀錢業封關，市塲停市數天，執貨負息，風險甚大，浮多懼有反響，脫意甚濃。</p>
<p>一二〇號天橋晨開三三〇〇〇元，中間供多求少，大戶軋現，人心萎軟，市况再見下游，跌入三萬關內，低至二八五〇〇元，二九〇〇〇元間，徘徊甚久。迨至收市，銀根稍鬆，缺單者亦多按排舒齊，塲上買意轉濃，喊價回升至三萬元，終以三一〇〇〇元前市收束，與前日後市比較，軋跌二千元。午後多單者逢小有吸，更以金鈔黑市回升，人心又好，市况重振。一二〇號天橋做三三三〇〇元，較前市回升二五〇〇元。東洋金三馬斯尼亞西石等，走勢均先平中軟，收市回升，午後東洋做三三七〇〇元，亦較前市回升二五〇〇元，其餘各檔漲跌趨勢均同。</p>
<p>生絲昨日市况先平後軟，洋行帮因市價狂漲狂跌，風險過大，市上銀根普緊，納胄不動，初聞業外各物走勢尙平，喊價尙穩，繼因大勢均軟，塲上脫貨求現，斬售不絕。D級七八勻度晨開四〇五〇〇元，優級零擔三九〇〇〇元，中間散戶了售，檯面納胃閒散，市勢層見低游，D級低至三七五〇〇元，優級三六五〇〇元，午後因人絲回升，業外各物市勢似見挺紥，金鈔黑市略升，喊價軟後轉高，Ｄ級喊四一〇〇〇元，優級三九〇〇〇元，較前市均升。</p>
<p>綢緞昨市先小後高，開盤後，人心頗軟，大戶脫貨求現，賣氣濃厚，更以新曆年邊市塲停市數天，散戶打算利息，頗多脫貨放息，於是市勢益告不支，美亞晨開一八〇〇〇元，華强一七八〇〇元，中間吐多納少，走勢軟弱，喊價步低。美亞小至一七二〇〇元，華强一七〇〇〇元均在軟檔徘徊，交易似見沉寂，晨後銀根緊後轉鬆，散空抵補，納胃重開，市勢軟後轉挺，美亞一九五〇〇元，華强一九四〇〇元了結，塲外則再做高一二百元，結果仍見挫跌。</p>

<h3>President to Deliver New Year's Day Message, Earnestly Explaining the Current Situation, Major Policies to be Finalized Today</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 30th] According to reliable sources, the central government is about to make a significant decision regarding the current situation. It is currently under careful consideration and may be finalized on the 31st. The approach may involve President Chiang issuing a message explaining the government's consistent advocacy for peace, pointing out the crux of the matter to clarify the situation and reassure the people. This decision is due to the recent turbulence in the situation, with frequent rumors spreading in Nanjing and Shanghai. Although all have been proven to have no factual basis, they clearly have some impact when they are spread. In particular, after the news of Yan Xishan, Hu Zongnan, and Lu Han arriving in Nanjing, and Song Ziwen and Fu Zuoyi coming to Nanjing, all parties paid the utmost attention and concern to the gathering of important local leaders in Nanjing. It is understood that President Chiang's purpose in summoning Yan, Hu, Lu, Song, and Fu to Nanjing was to consult their opinions on the current situation. Zhang Zhizhong, the Northwest Military and Political Director, who was originally scheduled to return to Lanzhou from Nanjing on the 30th, was also persuaded to stay by the President. Key figures in Sun Ke's wartime cabinet, including Zhang Qun, Chen Lifu, and Wu Tiecheng, also participated in the meeting. On the 30th, they had frequent contact throughout the day, and then gathered again at the President's official residence in the evening for consultations. It is reported that after listening to the opinions of the central government and local leaders, the President's decisions for the future have gradually become concrete and can be finalized after further consultations on the 31st, and announced to the country during the New Year. As far as is currently known, rumors of the President's retirement are absolutely false. It is even more absurd to say that people from a certain country hope that the President will retire in order to seek peace. The "certain country people" who were rumored have solemnly denied the matter to the relevant parties. Since inheriting Dr. Sun Yat-sen's leadership of the revolution, President Chiang has never considered his personal advancement or retreat, and has always been concerned with the interests of the people of the whole country. Therefore, his actions are also based on the interests of the people. The President's position was elected by the people, and he cannot have the idea of retiring without the permission of the people. After the victory and restoration, the convening of the Political Consultative Conference and peace talks with the Communist Party were all to respect the opinions of the people. When the Political Consultative Conference failed, and negotiations were hopeless, the Communist Party expanded its armed rebellion, and the government issued an order to suppress the bandits, also to save the people from fire and water, and to lay the foundation of the country for eternal peace. Future plans will still be decided by the people. President Chiang himself and the government seek peace and have long had a consistent belief in it. It is only because the Communist Party has resorted to arms and caused chaos that we have had to painfully carry out military suppression of the rebellion, in order to achieve peace as soon as possible. If the Communist Party can stop the rebellion and lay down its arms, the government will naturally be tolerant and study the way to coexist. However, the current rumors of peace are only the subjective opinions of some so-called "middlemen". The Communist Party has no response, let alone the opinion of the Communist Party. Therefore, the future development of the overall situation depends entirely on whether the Communist Party is aware of its errors. President Chiang's New Year's Day message may give a sincere explanation on this, so that the Communist Party knows the wrongness of its past and turns over a new leaf, then the people of the whole country can avoid the fate of being plunged into misery. Otherwise, the government will continue to work hard to suppress the bandit rebellion and cannot ignore the people in deep water and fiery heat. As for the military aspect, the government is still confident in reversing the situation, and the opportunity has already appeared. It is not necessary to rely entirely on foreign aid, and the government can firmly grasp the situation, so that the Communist Party realizes that its stubborn insistence on relying on force regardless of popular sentiment will inevitably lead to failure and destruction.</p>
<h3>Yan Xishan and Others Attend Meeting at President's Official Residence, Fu Zuoyi Stays in Peiping, Song Ziwen Flies to Nanjing</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 30th] The new Director of the Executive Yuan's Information Bureau, Shen Changhuan, refuted the rumors that Vice President Li advocated peace when answering questions at his first press conference for Chinese and foreign reporters in the afternoon of the 30th. Because a reporter at the press conference asked whether it was true that a certain news agency reported that Vice President Li advocated peace, Shen replied that he had personally visited Vice President Li today. Vice President Li was very surprised by the above news, dismissed it as unfounded, and said, "My will is always the President's will, and my decisions are always the President's decisions." Then a foreign reporter asked about the President's will. Shen replied, "The President's position can be found in the President's messages published in the past. I have nothing else to report." Shen also said that a message will be released on New Year's Day evening.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 30th] General Yan Xishan paid three visits to the President at 7:30 p.m. on the 30th. After attending the President's dinner, he also participated in an important meeting at the President's official residence. He had not returned to his residence by 11:00 p.m. On the afternoon of the 30th, American Ambassador Stuart Leighton hosted a dinner for Yan. At 5:15 p.m., Lieutenant General Barr, the head of the US military advisory group, also visited and had a long talk. On the 30th, those who visited Yan included Li Zongren, Zhang Qun, Wang Chonghui, Ju Zheng, Chen Lifu, Li Wenfan, and dozens of others. In the afternoon, Yan also visited Chen Lifu and Zhou Zhirou, and attended the Supervisory Committee's welcome party at 4:00 p.m., and attended Xu Kan's dinner at 6:00 p.m.</p>
<p>[Our Peiping Dispatch, 30th] As of 6:00 p.m. on the 30th, Commander-in-Chief Fu was still stationed in Peiping and Tianjin and had no news of going to Beijing. According to observers, the situation in the Tanggu and Dagu war zones is tense, and Fu urgently needs to be stationed in Peiping to command.</p>
<p>[Our Guangzhou Dispatch, 30th] Song Ziwen, summoned by the President's telegram, flew to Nanjing on the "Meiling" special plane on the morning of the 30th. Xu Shixuan and others accompanied him.</p>
<h3>At the Supervisory Committee's Reception, Yan Xishan Reiterated His Determination to Coexist with Taiyuan, Asking the Central Government to Provide Food for Soldiers and Civilians</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 30th] All the members of the Supervisory Yuan in Nanjing held a tea party at the International Club at 4:00 p.m. on the 30th to entertain Director Yan Xishan, who had come to Nanjing recently. During the party, Yan said that he was absolutely confident in ensuring Taiyuan and reiterated his determination to coexist with Taiyuan. When President Yu Youren and Vice President Liu Zhe gave welcome speeches, they praised Yan's revolutionary history, his contributions in the War of Resistance, and his achievements in suppressing the rebellion. They believed that the seamless cooperation between the army and the people in the Battle of Taiyuan, and the unyielding of the famous city, were all due to Yan's great spirit and wise leadership. Yan reported the current situation of Taiyuan in detail, saying that all the people of Taiyuan, except the old and the weak, had been fully mobilized, divided into three tasks: combat, participation in combat, and assistance in combat, directly and indirectly participating in the battle to defend Taiyuan. There are sufficient combat personnel and high morale in the Battle of Taiyuan. There is no problem in defending Taiyuan. The only current difficulty is the supply of food for the army and the people. He also said: The purpose of coming to Beijing this time is to ask the central government to help solve the food problem. Yan finally said that in addition to actively carrying out all deployments to defend Taiyuan, he had long been determined to coexist with the city. Success is for the happiness of the people and the needs of the country. If he unfortunately dies, it is also his personal destination. Supervisory Committee member Wang Xiangzhu then delivered a speech on behalf of the Supervisory Yuan's North China Inspection Group, saying that the group will soon go north for inspection. The original intention was to pay tribute to the military and political leaders and all the people of North China, and to learn from the effective measures to suppress the rebellion. Taking advantage of Director Yan's visit to Beijing, he first expressed his respect to him and asked him to convey his condolences to all the soldiers and civilians in Taiyuan. Wang also praised Yan for bringing a strong fighting will to the capital. The tea party ended at about 3:00 p.m.</p>
<h3>Wu Tiecheng Continues to Meet with Envoys, Schedules New Year's Day Reception for Diplomatic Corps</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 30th] Ministry of Foreign Affairs: Wu Tiecheng, Minister of Foreign Affairs concurrently, continued to meet with ambassadors, ministers, and charges d'affaires of various countries in the afternoon of the 30th, and scheduled a reception for the entire diplomatic corps on New Year's Day.</p>
<h3>He Yingqin Declares that He Did Not Send Representatives to Hong Kong</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, This City Dispatch] A United Press International dispatch from Hong Kong on the 29th stated that General He Yingqin had a representative in Hong Kong who had visited Li Jishen for discussions. General He specially told a reporter from the Central News Agency yesterday: "The above news is completely untrue. Yingqin has never sent representatives to Hong Kong during his tenure as Minister of National Defense and after his resignation."</p>
<h3>Chen Cheng is in Taiwan, No Date Set for Inauguration</h3>
<p>[Our Taipei Dispatch, 30th] Chen Cheng met with reporters at his private residence at 3:00 p.m. today at the request of the press. He had a ruddy complexion and was in good spirits. He talked for an hour without showing any signs of fatigue. Chen said: The illness has recovered, but he still needs a short period of rest. Therefore, after receiving the President's telegram last night, he replied by telegram requesting a delay in the transfer. The date of his inauguration is still awaiting orders. He also said: The country is in increasing difficulty, and he is willing to devote his life to any position. When reporters asked about his policy for governing Taiwan, Chen modestly said that he came to Taiwan to recuperate and had not had much contact. He is currently planning a week-long trip to the central, southern, and eastern parts of Taiwan. It is too early to talk about the policy for governing Taiwan, and even the impression of Taiwan needs to be gathered after the trip. However, Taiwan has been pioneered by Chairman Chen Yi and laid the foundation by Chairman Wei Daoming, and its stability is better than that of other provinces. The future problem should be how to achieve the supremacy of the people and the primacy of people's livelihood. The life of public education should be improved.</p>
<h3>Xuzhou Public Education Personnel Withdraw from Bandit Areas</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 30th] More than 2,000 Xuzhou public education personnel who followed Du's army south have been given proof by Du's troops that they are non-combatants and have safely withdrawn through the bandit area.</p>

<h3>The 30th Meeting of the Legislative Yuan Passes a Five-Fold Increase in Domestic Postage Rates, the General Budget Awaiting Submission Next Spring is Also Accepted</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 30th] The 33rd meeting of the second session of the Legislative Yuan began on the 30th. Because members from other provinces did not arrive in time, and the weather was bad, it was not until 10:30 a.m. that the legal quorum was barely met and the meeting was declared open. First, the reporting matters were heard. The Executive Yuan submitted that the government's general budget for the 38th year should be submitted for review when the meeting is resumed next spring. At the beginning of the new year, the budget and policy guidelines for the second half of the 37th year will be temporarily extended, and it is proposed to report them when the Legislative Yuan meets next time. All were accepted without objection. As for the draft amendment to the Business Tax Law, the draft amendment to the Household Registration Law, the draft amendment to the Organization Law of the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission, and the Temporary Property Tax Regulations, which have been approved by the President and transferred for reconsideration, were respectively submitted to the relevant committees for review. Then the discussion matters began, and the bills were handled as follows: (1) Draft Management of Foreign Exchange Regulations, resolved to pass according to the review amendment of the Financial Committee. (2) Adjustment of domestic postage rate table, resolved to pass according to the bill. (3) Amendment to Article 2 of the Organization Regulations of the Strategic Advisory Committee, resolved to pass according to the bill, changing the wording "specially hired strategic advisor" to "specially appointed general or appointed lieutenant general strategic advisor." As for the (4th) bill, the Legal Committee reported on the review and amendment of Articles 4 and 9 of the Executive Yuan Organization Law (i.e., adding one deputy secretary-general and two political members), the Executive Yuan temporarily notified by telephone and requested its withdrawal, and it was not submitted for discussion. The meeting adjourned at noon. The meeting continued at 4:00 p.m. to discuss bill (5) Amendment to the Air Force Medal Regulations, resolved to pass according to the review amendments of the Ministry of National Defense and the Legal Committee. (6) Amendment to the Mineral Area Tax Rate and Additional Amount in the Mining Law, resolved to pass according to the bill. (7) Supplementary Amendment Contract for US Cotton Loan, resolved to pass according to the bill. (8) China's loan contract for purchasing ten N3-type cargo ships from the United States, resolved to pass according to the review opinion, and the Executive Yuan was consulted for further explanation, and the necessary reference documents were supplemented. (9) Amendment to Article 57 of the Law on Punishment of Violation of Police Regulations, resolved to pass according to the bill. At 5:00 p.m., the meeting was declared adjourned because the meeting place was again out of power, and it was decided to continue the meeting on the 31st to handle the unfinished cases.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 30th] The Legislative Yuan passed the bill to adjust domestic postage rates on the 30th, increasing postage rates by five times the current price, which will be implemented simultaneously nationwide from New Year's Day in the 38th year. The new prices for various types of mail are as follows: letter 5 jiao, postcard (single) 2 jiao 5 fen, (double) 5 jiao, newspaper category 1 3 fen, category 2 2 fen, category 3 1 fen, books, printed matter, trade contracts, etc. 2 jiao 5 fen, Braille documents 2 jiao 5 fen, business circulars 5 jiao, samples 5 jiao, registration fee 1 yuan 5 jiao, priority mail fee 5 jiao, express registration fee 2 yuan.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 30th] The Legislative Yuan passed the bill to amend Article 57 of the Law on Punishment of Violation of Police Regulations at the regular meeting on the 30th, deleting its second item. Because the household registration business has been transferred from the police agency to the household registration agency, it is not necessary to include it in the Law on Punishment of Violation of Police Regulations.</p>
<h3>Anhui Western Local Communists Stirring Up Trouble, Situation in Huoshan Unclear, Personnel of Anhui Provincial Government Encountered Bandits on Way West</h3>
<p>[Our Hefei Dispatch, 30th] In the freezing weather, this place has become an isolated city. Except for the smooth running of the Hefei-Bengbu train, all highway vehicles have been suspended.

The last batch of personnel of the Provincial Government encountered bandits on the way to Anqing, and some personnel were captured. It is now reported that they have escaped, but some vehicles and equipment have been lost. The Anhui Western local communists took the opportunity to stir up trouble, and the situation in Huoshan has been unclear since yesterday morning.</p>

<h3>Air Force Deputy Commander-in-Chief Wang Shuming's Speech: The Air Force Exerted Its Greatest Power in the Xuzhou-Bengbu Battle, Emphasizing the Determination of All Officers and Soldiers to Save the Situation</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 30th] Air Force Deputy Commander-in-Chief Wang Shuming, braving the rain at the airport today, after repeated invitations from reporters, finally talked to reporters about the Air Force's operations in the Xuzhou-Bengbu battle, saying: (1) Due to the rampant bandits, the Air Force had to exert its high function to save the situation. Therefore, the places where the ground fighting was the fiercest, such as Nianzhuang, Shuangduiji, and Qinglongji, were also the places where the Air Force concentrated its firepower to attack the bandits. Once the bandit troops were discovered, they immediately became mutilated. The Air Force does not want to estimate the figures of this battle result. The fact that the bandits have not been able to launch a crossing-the-Huai River attack on the Yangtze River so far can be found in this factor. (2) A battle example can be cited as evidence: At dawn on the 7th of this month, just as Liu-Chen's bandit troops were confronting the National Army's Huang Wei and Du Yuming units in Shuangduiji and Qinglongji on the west side of the Jinpu Road, Chen Yi's bandit troops sent a force of more than 10,000 people, bypassing to the east side of Jinpu Road, Heqiaozhen, Xuyi County, to steal across the Huai River and go south, intending to attack the rear south of Bengbu. At that time, there were 200 wooden boats busy loading bandits and crossing the river south on both sides. The beaches and reeds on both sides were also full of bandit personnel, mules, horses, carts and other baggage. Because the weather was unusually bad on the night of the 7th, the bandits thought they could hide from the eyes of the Air Force and take the opportunity to steal across the river. Unexpectedly, at dawn the next day, they were discovered by Squad Leader Wu Guoliang's single plane. He reported the bandit situation by radio and swooped down to bomb and shoot. I immediately sent about 50 aircraft of various types to fly to Heqiaozhen to intercept. By the afternoon, all the bandit troops had been wiped out. Broken boats drifted on the river, and the reeds on both sides were completely destroyed. Only a few hundred bandits escaped. If this bandit unit that raided the rear had not been wiped out at that time, the bandits would have fled to Mingguang, cut off the rear road of Bengbu, and then took the opportunity to increase the number of bandit troops pouring south, which might have changed the situation between the Yangtze and Huai Rivers early on. (3) Today, I received a telegram from Deputy Commander-in-Chief Du Yuming saying: According to the captives' confessions, "The instructor said that if Mr. Liu had not gone to Jinan for medical treatment, the situation would not have become so bad today." Judging from the current state of depression of the bandits after the Huaihai battle, it is possible that some major accidents have occurred within the bandits' side. The heavy casualties of the bandit troops are certainly one end, and Liu Bocheng being bombed to death may be one of the key factors. Ground intelligence said: "On December 14, when Liu Bocheng's command post was fighting fiercely in Shuangduiji, it moved from Sunchouji to Qixianji." The route of the movement must pass through Taoyuanji. Since December 5, the Air Force has blockaded all the main roads and small paths around Shuangduiji. Since the 12th, it has carried out destructive bombing of the villages occupied by the bandits on the periphery. On the 14th, it also sent C24-type aircraft to concentrate on bombing Taoyuanji. If the Liu bandit was indeed bombed to death, it must be the battle result of the C24-type aircraft on that day. Wang emphasized the Air Force's determination to save the situation and its firm loyalty to the President, believing that the "kneeling political strategy" of those who advocate peace will harm the military force far more than the blows inflicted by the bandits, and hoped that the situation would be clarified as soon as possible.</p>
<h3>National Army Launches Pursuit in Tanggu and Dagu, Strongholds on the North Bank of the Haihe River Recaptured One After Another, The Main Force of the Bandits in the Suburbs of Peiping Has Moved Far Away, There Was Contact in Southern Tianjin Yesterday</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Peiping, 30th] The North China Suppression Headquarters announced: The National Army in the Tanggu and Dagu area has a strong force and solid fortifications. The bandits could not find an opportunity to take advantage of it. At dawn on the 29th, they fled one after another. The National Army's cavalry troops, in cooperation with the naval forces, immediately launched a pursuit. By 3:00 p.m., the strongholds on the north bank of the Haihe River along the coast, Xichang, Jingfeng Material Factory, Zhao's Factory, and Xinhe, had been recaptured one after another. The troops in Xidagu are echoing the troops attacking from Tanggu from the north and south, and are searching westward along both banks of the Haihe River.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tianjin, 30th] The Tianjin Garrison Headquarters announced: Xinhe, west of Tanggu, has now been confirmed to have been recaptured by the National Army.</p>
<p>[Our Tianjin Dispatch, 29th] The bandits' movements in the outer perimeter of Tianjin and Tanggu are frequent. The 1st, 2nd, 4th, 6th, 7th, 8th, 9th, and 10th columns of Lin Biao have been discovered one after another. Most of their main force is concentrated in the area north of the Tianjin-Tanggu line. There are currently no signs of a full-scale fierce battle in the outer perimeter of Tianjin. There was no fighting in Tanggu on the 29th. The 7th column of bandits in the outer perimeter is fleeing to Yangcun. The National Army gave chase on the morning of the 29th. The 2nd column of bandits is still organizing fortifications in the outer perimeter of Tanggu. Under the suppression of the National Army's naval artillery fire, the 9th column of bandits south of Dagu is also retreating in a southwest direction. Some of them fled to southern Tianjin. On the morning of the 29th, they came into contact with the National Army in Liqizhuang, southern Tianjin. The National Army fired artillery fiercely, which could be clearly heard in the city. The bandits retreated in the afternoon. Several thousand bandits occupy Yixingbu in northern Tianjin, and the 8th column of bandits occupies Guan'erzhuang in eastern Tianjin.</p>
<p>[Our Peiping Dispatch, 30th] As the new year is approaching, the atmosphere of war in the ancient capital is gradually fading. The main force of the Lin bandits in the surrounding area seems to have moved far away to other places. Although the sound of aircraft bombing and shooting and the sound of gunfire at midnight can still be heard from time to time, the citizens are accustomed to it and no longer panic. They all believe that Commander-in-Chief Fu will be able to protect the safety of the ancient capital. The city defense works in Peiping have been completed after two weeks of rushing repairs. Houses, graves, and trees around the city that do not cause major obstacles have been ordered to stop demolition. Order in the city has returned to normal, and the troops occupying civilian houses in the west city are gradually moving out. The streets are no longer crowded with hurried scenes. Through the efforts of the authorities, the use of water and electricity has not fully recovered, but the great panic no longer exists.</p>
<p>[Our Tianjin Dispatch, 30th] Fighting around Tianjin has resumed. Fierce fighting broke out on the line of Caijiatai and Wujiatai (west of Huidui) in southern Tianjin at noon on the 30th. The Air Force flew to the suburbs of Tianjin for the first time and assisted in the battle there. The fierce fighting stopped after more than two hours. There was also contact in the Dabizhuang area in northern Tianjin in the afternoon, which continued until the evening. The situation in the Tanggu and Dagu area was quiet.</p>
<h3>Lamentable and Tragic: The Rear Cannot Imagine the Reality - A True Account of the Arduous Battles Fought by Du Yuming's Troops - Report from an Air Force Officer Flown Out of the Xiaoyong Area</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 30th] An Air Force senior officer who landed at the airfield in the Xiaoyong area where Du Yuming's troops were stationed on December 18th aboard a C47 transport plane piloted by Captain Lin Guanxiong, having spent eleven days in the hellish battlefield and completed his mission, flew out of Du's defense area on the 29th aboard a TT17 Mosquito aircraft piloted by Chen Xianyu and Li Zhongqing, arriving in Nanjing.</p>
<p>This Air Force officer began by stating emphatically, "I can responsibly say that the role played by Du Yuming's troops in the Qinglongji and Chenguanzhuang areas of Xiaoyong is beyond the comprehension of those in the rear, such as Nanjing and Shanghai. The morale of the officers and men of the Qiu Qingquan and Li Mi army corps is currently very firm. Although their lives are miserable, they are, after all, veteran troops of over ten years and will certainly not disintegrate. Moreover, they will certainly be able to bear the heavy responsibilities they have on the entire Jianghuai battlefield."</p>
<p>When asked by the reporter about the number of troops under Du's command, he stated with certainty, "There are currently 240,000 men, fully equipped."</p>
<p>The following are the words of the officer. Why did this large army corps head south from Xuzhou to attack the enemy's rear, only to end up stationed in the Xiaoyong area for over twenty days? What are its future movements and its role? These are not things that newspapers can reveal. This is a mixed group formed by the characteristics of the troops, habits, strategies, and tactics of both the Nationalists and the Communists. One thing is very important: unless it collapses on its own, such a large and well-equipped army corps will never be swallowed up by the current weak enemy forces. With Du Yuming's talent as a general, assisted by Qiu Qingquan and Li Mi, it will certainly not collapse.</p>
<p>The area where Du's troops are stationed is not very large, and there are not many villages or houses. Most of the soldiers are sleeping in trenches in the open. Fortunately, the parachutes used for airdropping ammunition are being used by the soldiers to provide shelter from the cold. In recent days, heavy snow has fallen, preventing the soldiers from dying from snow penetration.</p>
<p>The officers and men do not lack ammunition. For the first ten days, they dug up civilian food to satisfy their hunger. After the airdropping of food, the food supply was resolved. However, when bags of rice weighing 20 and 40 kilograms fell, they killed and injured about 30 to 40 officers and men every day. For the first ten days, the enemy fired over a thousand artillery shells into the area every day. In the following ten days, only a hundred or so shells were fired each day. The destructive power of the artillery shells was very small. The enemy surrounded the Nationalist troops in deep trenches, adopting a purely psychological warfare tactic, with the shelling serving only as a decoration.</p>
<p>Counter-Screaming is Like a Play</p>
<p>The concrete expression of this psychological warfare is shouting. The Nationalist troops also responded with banter, for example:</p>
<p>Enemy: "Come over here! What are you fighting for when you have nothing to eat? Don't suffer!"</p>
<p>Nationalist troops: "Who says so? We have airdrops!"</p>
<p>Enemy: "What are you airdropping?"</p>
<p>Nationalist troops: "Canned beef, pancakes, bread. Listen to the sound of the cans!" The soldiers knocked on empty cans.</p>
<p>The enemy sounded envious.</p>
<p>Another shouting example:</p>
<p>The enemy beat gongs and drums, attracting the attention of the Nationalist troops, and shouted: "Come over here! We have roasted pig to eat!" The enemy whipped a pig, and the pig squealed. Suddenly, the pig ran out, crossed the trench, and reached the Nationalist troops' position, where it was pinned down.</p>
<p>Nationalist troops: "Haha, your pig has defected! You come over too!"</p>
<p>The enemy was disheartened and silent. The pig became a birthday gift for the Chief of Staff of the 72nd Army.</p>
<p>The Miserable Situation is the Same on Both Sides</p>
<p>At night on the battlefield, dozens of deserters from both sides fled to the other side. Spies sent by both sides were also mixed among the deserters to gather intelligence about the enemy. The multicolored parachutes supporting the shelters looked like a market or yurts. The soldiers under them were lying in trenches day after day, mixed with the groans of wounded soldiers and military dependents giving birth, making hell appear in the glow of the watchman's lamp. The enemy deserters who surrendered also recounted the enemy's miserable situation: they had been lying in trenches for dozens of days, eating only one or two bowls of porridge a day, which was brought by the enemy forcing the common people from thirty miles away. The enemy was not full, and the people were crying in agony. Initially, fifteen Communist columns came to encircle them. After 27 days of stalemate, the enemy had suffered 100,000 dead, wounded, deserted, and sick. Now, only the remnants of nine column numbers remain to guard them.</p>
<p>A Cigarette Costs Two Hundred Yuan</p>
<p>The officer also said: General Du Yuming was not wounded and was as healthy as ever. He treated the Air Force personnel who came to share the hardships as brothers, giving them cotton shoes, cotton quilts, and coats to keep them warm. In his spare time, he often played bridge with these Air Force officers and the head of the medical department, constantly supplying them with cigarettes from Shanghai and Nanjing. On the battlefield, a cigarette cost 200 yuan, and a puff cost 10 yuan. Those who were addicted but had no money often surrounded those who had cigarettes, waiting to enjoy the end of their cigarettes. All the generals below Qiu Qingquan and Li Mi were safe, with only two division commanders suffering bullet wounds. The wounded officers and men were eagerly awaiting airdrops of penicillin and other medicines, and even more so, cigarettes. Due to a lack of fuel, it was imperative to change the airdropped food to pancakes and bread that could be eaten immediately.</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Expectations for the New Administration in Taiwan</h3>
<p>Just as generals from all over are gathering in the capital, the Executive Yuan, in order to strengthen local administration and cooperate with the overall war effort, has approved the appointment of Qin Decun as the head of Shandong Province and Chen Cheng as the head of Taiwan Province. This is a measure that deserves great attention. General Qin Decun is a native of Shandong. The central government's appointment of Qin to head Shandong demonstrates that the government will not abandon Shandong and intends to recover the lost territories of Shandong. General Chen Cheng is proficient in military strategy and is a well-known military and political figure of our time. The central government's appointment of Chen to head Taiwan demonstrates the government's emphasis on the Taiwan region and will fully leverage Taiwan's human and material resources to carry out economic construction and support the war against the Communists. We attach importance to Taiwan's future and, on the day of Chen's assumption of his new post, we would like to express our wishes for Taiwan's future.</p>
<p>Taiwan is currently one of the most stable and peaceful provinces in our country, and its political and economic status has attracted worldwide attention. Geographically, Taiwan is located between the East China Sea and the South China Sea. Its famous islands include three parts: Taiwan Island, the Penghu Islands, and the Nansha Islands, which are collectively called Taiwan Province. It overlooks the Pacific Ocean to the east, faces Fujian Province to the west, adjoins the Ryukyu Islands to the northeast, and faces the Philippines to the south. Its situation is extremely dangerous. The land area is 35,961 square kilometers, and the population is about 6.6 million people. Currently, the number of agencies and factories evacuated to Taiwan from Nanjing and Shanghai is increasing day by day, and the population has reached more than 7 million, and there is a trend of continued increase. Taiwan Province has fertile land and abundant products. Medium-sized industrial organizations and agricultural cooperatives have already built a solid foundation. Unfortunately, in the three years since its restoration, human resources, geographical advantages, and products have not been fully utilized, leading to criticisms of being closed-minded and self-sufficient. In fact, Taiwan Province is a part of China. Its relationship with the mainland is like that of lips and teeth, especially the relationship with the provinces of South China is the closest. Therefore, in the future, Taiwan's construction preparations must strengthen the connections with the provinces of South China, and how to use the human resources and technology of the mainland to give play to human resources, geographical advantages, and products in the province, which is the important issue for the administration of Taiwan Province in the future.</p>
<p>In the past, those who governed Taiwan with the most outstanding achievements and were recorded in history were the two generations of national heroes, Zheng Chenggong and his son. Ming general Zheng Chenggong once defeated the Dutch and restored Taiwan, using Taiwan as a base for restoring the Ming Dynasty. Zheng Chenggong and his son ruled Taiwan for 23 years, laying the foundation for construction and enhancing the national spirit. Although it was later invaded by Japan and Taiwan was lost, the national consciousness and the spirit of national restoration had taken root in the people of Taiwan. The Japanese ruled Taiwan for 51 years, and the revolutionary movement of the people of Taiwan never ceased for a day. It was not until Japan's defeat and surrender that the revolutionary movement of the people of Taiwan cooperated with the surrender of the Nationalist army and showed their pride. Now, the country is in turmoil, and there is a sea of ​​fire north of the Yangtze River. Only the three islands of Taiwan stand between the East China Sea and the South China Sea. Therefore, how to promote the national spirit of Zheng Chenggong and his son and use Taiwan as a base for the restoration of the mainland is a matter of great historical significance.</p>
<p>We attach importance to the importance of Taiwan, cherish the great historical significance of Taiwan, and naturally hold endless hopes for Taiwan's political and economic construction in the future. We hope that General Chen Cheng will adhere to the spirit of hard work, practical work, and tough work, use a new style to promote new policies, sweep away the past accumulation of slackness in local administration, build Taiwan into a new Taiwan, and further promote the spirit of Taiwan to support the current crisis of the nation-state. Mencius said: "Now, if the state of Teng were to take the best soil of the state of Chu and the best soil of the state of Yue, and add them together, it would only be fifty square li. Even then, it could be a good country." What's more, today's Taiwan has abundant products, a prosperous population, and all industrial and agricultural organizations have established a solid foundation. Governing and constructing Taiwan with a new style, leading Taiwan to progress and brightness, is bound to be a certain thing, and it is something that Chen can bravely do. We are delighted to hear about the great significance of Chen's leadership of Taiwan, and therefore we have endless hopes for Taiwan. We hope that Chen will recognize the difficulties of the times, strive to do his best, and answer the people inside and outside Taiwan Province with new facts as soon as possible.</p>
<h3>Supervisory Committee Dissatisfied with New Silver Standard Regulations - Representatives Sent to Visit Xu Kan - Decisions on Censure or Rectification Will Be Made After Investigation</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 30th] In view of the many areas in need of improvement in the national bank's gold and silver exchange policy, the Supervisory Yuan submitted the issue for discussion in the Finance and Food Committee on the 30th. Chairman Sun Yulin and other committee members expressed their opinions on the current policy, and strongly criticized the improvement measures decided by the Executive Yuan this time. Two points were emphasized: (1) Collecting a balancing fee when exchanging is tantamount to raising prices in disguise, and when prices rise, public school personnel cannot benefit from it. The result is that it still flows into the hands of scalpers. (2) The gold yuan issuance method once stipulated that each tael of gold would be worth 2,000 gold yuan. Now, increasing the price with a balancing fee is equivalent to changing the law by order. As for cracking down on the black market, the issue is not whether it can be cracked down, but whether there is the determination to crack down. It was then decided to send committee members Wang Xiangchen, Sun Yulin, and Yu Zhenzhou to visit Minister Xu of the Ministry of Finance on the 31st to investigate before deciding whether to propose a censure or rectification case. In addition, a temporary motion was also discussed at today's meeting, which was a censure case against Liu Gongyun, the current deputy governor of the Central Bank, for embezzling state bank funds and engaging in corruption and bribery during his previous tenure as director of the Central Trust Bureau. This case was filed by Committee Member Tang Honglie after receiving a petition from the people. The case listed several facts, including the part of the Fujian Railway Company, the part of manufacturers such as the Datong Cotton Industry Company borrowing funds from the Trust Bureau, and the part of Northeast soybeans. After discussion at the meeting on the 30th, it was decided to hand it over for review.</p>
<p>[Our Hankou Dispatch, 30th] The Supervisory Committee of Hubei and Hunan believes that the financial authorities have repeatedly changed the silver standard regulations, and it is difficult to escape the blame for dereliction of duty.

<h3>Truman Orders Relevant Departments to Draw Up New Foreign Aid Plan for Submission to the New Congress for Review Next Year</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 29th] President Truman today urged the drafting of a massive new foreign aid plan to bolster foreign reconstruction and strengthen anti-communist defenses. The President has ordered government departments to quickly provide foreign aid budgets so that the President can draft a message for discussion after the new Congress convenes. State Department Legal Counsel Gross has been qualified as a foreign aid plan adjustment commissioner to preside over this work, and the foreign aid economic plan will be provided by Hoffman, Director of the Economic Cooperation Administration. The new Congress is scheduled to open next Wednesday. The military aid program includes the supply of weapons and equipment to Western European countries, and the United States is discussing a joint defense treaty with Western European countries. It also includes continued aid to Greece and Turkey to combat communism, and possible aid to China. The first-year funding to restore Western European armaments is estimated at between $2 billion and $3 billion. The actual funding requested from Congress may be greatly reduced, and some supplies can be drawn from inventory. According to the State Department, Truman has ordered all relevant departments to closely adjust their work to the greatest extent possible so that all aspects of economic and military foreign aid can be as perfect as possible in terms of policy, budget, and supply.</p>

<h3>First Draft of the Atlantic Pact Completed; Seven Countries Jointly Defend Against Aggression; Has Been Sent to Their Respective Governments for Approval</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 29th] It is learned that the first draft of the Atlantic Pact was completed today. The ambassadors of France, Britain, Canada, Belgium, Luxembourg, and the Netherlands to the United States have sent the draft to their respective governments for approval. Once the governments have approved it, or made detailed revisions, it will be sent back to Washington for immediate negotiation of the final draft. Although the pact recognizes the principle of mutual agreement among the participating countries, no provision stipulates that if one of the countries is attacked, the other countries will automatically intervene militarily. Each country is free to make its own decisions on this matter.</p>
<p>The outline of the pact is as follows: (1) No participating country has a veto; (2) Provisions regarding the completion of economic and political sanctions in the event of aggression; (3) The pact stipulates that in the event that one of the signatory countries is attacked, each signatory country will take immediate action, but one of the signatory countries may not take military intervention without consent (4) The pact should be regarded as a regional agreement formed within the United Nations framework to further unite Western European democracies. The signatory countries appear to have included a clause in the agreement to invite neighboring countries such as Italy or the Scandinavian countries to participate in the future. The broad policy of the pact has three characteristics: (1) In terms of the regional agreement formed within the framework of Article 41 of the United Nations Charter, it aims to defend each other when signatory countries are attacked and the Security Council has not yet taken action. (2) In the event of aggression, the decisions passed by a two-thirds majority of the signatory countries must be followed by the remaining countries. (3) The pact stipulates a method for consultation between the seven countries of the United States, France, Britain, the Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg, and Canada, and other possible signatory countries.</p>

After leading the attendees in a bow, Mayor Wu delivered a speech, stating roughly: Mr. Zhang Hanting is today receiving the Shanghai Honorary Citizen Medal, which is deeply respected. There are precedents for shipwrecks and risking one's life to save others. Mr. Zhang saved the lives of hundreds of passengers in a moment of crisis, abandoning the cargo of the "Jinyuanli" without regard. This spirit of righteousness and courage is truly commendable and has great significance for social morality. When he was offered the Shanghai Honorary Citizen Medal, Mr. Zhang humbly declined. After I explained in detail that the heroic spirit of all the crew members of the "Jinyuanli" was sufficient to represent and promote the virtues that our country has always possessed, and to inspire citizens to emulate, he finally agreed to accept. The "Jinyuanli" rescued passengers of the Jiangya, acting selflessly to save others, which is sufficient to reverse the declining trends in social morality. Therefore, in accordance with the resolution of the Municipal Council, the Honorary Citizen Medal is solemnly presented to commend his actions. After Mayor Wu finished his speech, he proceeded to read a telegram from Minister Hong of the Ministry of Interior.

<p>Zhang Hanting Expresses Humility in His Acceptance Speech</p>
<p>After receiving the Honorary Citizen Medal, Mr. Zhang Hanting delivered an acceptance speech, saying: Mayor Wu has presented me with the Honorary Citizen Medal for rescuing the passengers of the Jiangya, and I feel extremely ashamed to accept it. The "Jinyuanli" motor sailboat sailed out of Shanghai on the afternoon of the 3rd of this month and, passing the sea area where the Jiangya shipwrecked, saw the passengers in a moment of crisis. All the crew members bravely rescued them, driven entirely by human compassion. The "Jinyuanli" is a very small tonnage vessel. It placed its bow against the side of the Jiangya, rescuing more than 450 passengers. It was a stroke of luck, and there is no merit to speak of. The forty-odd crew members of the "Jinyuanli" not only saved the lives of the passengers of the Jiangya but also provided warmth with their clothes to the rescued passengers and refused to accept rewards from the rescued passengers. This is something that can comfort the leaders of all sectors and people of society. After Mr. Zhang finished his acceptance speech, Xu Jiliao, on behalf of Municipal Councilor Chairman Pan Gongzhan, and Du Yuesheng, President of the Local Association, delivered speeches, all praising Mr. Zhang for receiving the Shanghai Honorary Citizen Medal. The ceremony concluded at 3:40 PM.</p>
<p>Here is the telegram that Minister of Interior Hong Lanyou sent to the Mayor yesterday to be forwarded to Zhang Hanting, the righteous and courageous captain of the "Jinyuanli": To Mayor Wu of the Shanghai Municipal Government, please forward to Mr. Zhang Hanting: When the Jiangya sank outside Wusong Estuary, more than 3,000 passengers were swept away by the waves. Their cries for help shook the heavens. Just then, your ship passed by, and you immediately threw the fully loaded cargo into the river and rescued hundreds of lives. You valued righteousness over profit, and sacrificed yourself to save others. Your compassionate virtue and benevolent demeanor are admired far and wide. Your compassion for the hungry and drowned, and your great benevolence and wisdom, are enough to awaken the world to value human life and to be courageous in doing what is right. In the future, your model and example will surely inspire others to emulate your virtue and save fellow countrymen from danger. There will be no end to it. As you are being presented with the Shanghai Honorary Citizen Medal and a ceremony is being held, I hereby send a special telegram to express my intentions and sincere congratulations. Hong Lanyou.</p>

<h3>A Glimpse of the Border Region of Zhenjing: Savage Lands Transformed into Communist Bandit Hideouts, Authorities Urgently Need to Pay Close Attention</h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent of This Newspaper, Liang Yushan</p>
<p>[Guilin, This Newspaper, 24th] Jingxi and Zhenbian counties, remotely located in the southwestern border region, have always been obscure. Years of war have turned many remote villages into bustling marketplaces. During the War of Resistance Against Japan, the enemy's iron hooves forced groups of people to flee to the southwest. After the victory, the communist bandits incited chaos, and Jingxi and Zhenbian became transit points for bandits. The "Zhenjing Border Region" began to attract people's attention.</p>
<p>**Perilous Stone Mountains, Communist Bandits Entrenched**</p>
<p>Zhenbian and Jingxi counties are adjacent to each other, forming the protruding area in southwestern Guizhou Province. They connect to Yunnan in the north and Longzhou and Pingxiang in this province to the south, and border Vietnam. Along the Leizhou indigenous territory to Sile, there are 207 boundary markers erected with Vietnam, the boundary line is 1901 li in length. To the area where Zhenjing connects, the Bainan territory is 90 li from the Vietnamese Baole territory, the Pingmeng territory is 8 li from the Vietnamese Shuojiang territory, and the Longbang territory is 25 li from the Vietnamese Chaling territory, similarly managing border affairs between the two countries. Zhenjing is a hilly area more than 400 feet high, with no good natural barriers along the border. There are also many stone mountains within the territory. The local people live by the mountains, and villages are formed at the foot of stone mountains on all sides. There is no communication between the villages. Due to the treacherous terrain, it is easy to attract bandits to gather. From last winter to February this year, communist bandits colluded with local bandits to occupy the Pingmeng, Nongyin, Bainan, Mianliang, and Guole townships. When officials came, the bandits fled, and the bandits had long relied on the terrain to commit evil deeds.</p>
<p>Zhenbian and Jingxi were savage lands during the Tang Dynasty, and remained under indigenous chieftains until the Qing Dynasty. In the fifth year of the Yongzheng reign, the system of indigenous chieftains was abolished and replaced with centrally appointed officials, belonging to Zhen'an Prefecture. In the thirteenth year of the Guangxu reign, Jingxi was changed to Guishun Directly Subordinate Prefecture, and Zhenbian was also changed to Zhen'an County under its jurisdiction. In the Republic of China, the prefectures were abolished and counties were established, and the names were changed because they were considered uncouth, hence the current names. During the Sino-French War in the eleventh year of the Guangxu reign, the Qing government ceded territory and sought peace despite winning the war. The relationship of suzerainty between us and Vietnam for more than a thousand years was severed from then on, and Zhenbian and Jingxi became important areas for national defense.</p>
<p>**Sleeping Above, Raising Pigs Below**</p>
<p>Jingxi County has an area of 10,976 square li, with a population of more than 240,000. Zhenbian is smaller, with an area of 8,721 square li and a population of more than 80,000, of which Zhenbian still has more than 1,000 Miao and Yao ethnic minorities. Most of them have been assimilated. Even the few Miao and Yao ethnic minorities are no different from the Han people in appearance, only retaining their characteristics in clothing. The collar of their upper garment has only a round neckline, without a raised collar edge. Their clothes and trousers are decorated with thick diagonal stripes.</p>
<p>The lives of the border people are exceptionally arduous. Their dwellings are as simple as bunk beds, with people sleeping on the upper bunk and pigs and cattle in the trough below. The stench fills the air, and they seem to have become accustomed to this simple life, like "entering a stall of abalone." The land there is barren and desolate, producing very little rice, and they mostly rely on coarse grains to maintain their lives. Corn (i.e., millet) is widely grown in the mountains and fields. The annual corn harvest is enough to feed them for half a year, so after each autumn harvest, all their hopes are placed on this crop. Another special product among the coarse grains is called Job's tears. Job's tears is called "Gan Zhu" by the Vietnamese, and they often use it as a substitute for rice or mix it with rice to cook.</p>
<p>**Eating Rice and Job's Tears, A Sweetness in the Bitterness**</p>
<p>There are two lines in their folk songs: "Eating rice and Job's tears, Job's tears cost one, rice costs two, from my man two rice, I only get one Job's tears." Another goes: "My man is Gan Zhu, I am Job's tears, pitying that we are both beads, sweetness and bitterness are always similar." This folk song, passed down for a long time, vividly expresses their living conditions, their lives are a bittersweet mix. Men and women are also very open-minded, especially those young girls, who are even more passionate and unrestrained. After work, they gather in groups of three or five, resting in the mountains and forests, answering each other in pairs, singing out the love words hidden deep in their hearts. Men mostly sing words of flirtation and admiration, while women respond with words of encouragement. Here are a few lines of their singing and answering: "Small mouth, moth eyebrows, melon seed face, who can see her and not love her?" (Man) "The sun is setting and heading west, if we don't go back, how can we explain?" (Woman) Accompanied by their "Ah Ai!" folk tunes, it is quite pleasant to hear. In the border areas, these operatic scenes are not difficult to see. After a deeper feeling develops between a man and a woman, they give each other gifts, but the gifts are very simple. Ordinary men mostly give handkerchiefs and cloth, while women mostly give cloth shoes made by their own hands. A beautiful girl's object of admiration is a young man from outside. They admire them very simply because they have knowledge and have read books.</p>
<p>**Education of Border People Gradually Improving**</p>
<p>The educational level of the border people was relatively backward compared to the interior at that time. In fact, as a result of the government's encouragement of border people to study and encouragement of teachers to go to the border areas, the education of border people has greatly improved in recent years. Judging by the number of students in Jingxi County alone: currently, there are more than 20 students studying at Guangxi University, more than 10 at Nanning Normal College, and also several at Guangxi Provincial Medical College. Considering their environment, these numbers are quite remarkable.</p>
<p>**Mao Bandits and Viet Cong Echo Each Other**</p>
<p>Currently, there is a more important issue than education in this border area. The Viet Cong Ho Chi Minh faction has recently been suppressed by the French army and is hiding in the Yue area of Heshang Township, Vietnam, while another faction uses Shangnong in Baole as its base. The bandit army commanded by Mao bandit's Xiang Ying and Li Jishen, including Zhu Jiabi's "People's Self-Salvation Army of the Yunnan-Guizhou-Guangxi Border Region," and the "People's Liberation Army of the Yunnan-Vietnam Border Region," and the "Jingzhen People's Liberation Army," etc., are also entrenched in the mountainous areas of Tongwen and Baole, echoing the Viet Cong, oppressing border people to join the army, engaging in replenishment and training, and at the same time implementing a poisoning policy, forcing border people to plant large quantities of opium, causing Jingxi County to become a den of "black goods" and a paradise for criminals. The impact has spread along the Zuo River and You River to the West River, a large river traversing Guizhou Province, covering it with the footprints of opium addicts. The bandits have changed their past style of killing and adopted a gentle policy to deceive the border people, using local communists in various villages along the Sino-Vietnamese border, ostensibly "arming and protecting the autumn harvest," but in reality satisfying their ambition to plunder grain. The lives of the border people are no longer as comfortable as before.</p>
<p>Heshang and Tongwen are inhabited by the Miao people. They call themselves "Tongwen Prefecture, Heshang Province," forming an independent tribe. Although nominally under the jurisdiction of Guizhou Province, it is actually another small world, which is being used by the bandits as a nest for lurking and growing. The government must pay attention to saving the border people and defending the border as soon as possible, and never allow them to grow stronger.</p>
<h3>Two Major Tasks in Xikang: Eradicating Drugs and Suppressing Bandits, Stabilizing the Rear and Supporting the Front Lines</h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent of This Newspaper, Xu Renchang</p>
<p>[Ya'an, This Newspaper, 22nd] Xikang, an exception to the national martial law, seems much quieter than other provinces. There are no communist bandits entrenched or causing disturbances in the territory. The people are generally not facing great turmoil except for being threatened by commodity prices to some extent. In this situation, compared with those provinces with wars and famines, it seems to be a "Shangri-La" paradise. It can be said that it is really not easy for Xikang to have such stability today, but this stability work is not enough and has not yet reached the ideal state, and further efforts are still needed. This is what the Xikang authorities should pay special attention to.</p>
<p>**Eradicating Opium**</p>
<p>This is the most important task for stability in Xikang now, because the territory is full of high mountains, which are continuous. In recent years, Han people have been forced by high prices and livelihood to find other ways out besides collecting herbs or growing crops in the mountains, and they have to take risks in the direction of high profits. This group of poor people has also opened up new roads in the high mountains bordering neighboring provinces, where people are not easy to reach, opening up fields and secretly planting tobacco seedlings, applying fertilizer, and harvesting them in the second year. The profit is ten times the income from collecting herbs and farming.</p>
<p>**Secretly Planting Tobacco Seedlings**</p>
<p>In addition to these people who are forced to take risks and secretly plant tobacco, there are also people who have money and can live a good life who also do this. Most of these people are evil forces in society, with the name of Elder Brother Society, they have considerable military power in the local area. They usually do whatever they want, bully the people, and collude with the government. They want to do everything between the people and the government. With a small amount of funds, they use the ignorant and weak people they control to do the work of secretly planting tobacco seedlings. In the end, they can get a huge sum of money without hard work. There are such people everywhere in this vast crowd. In addition, there is another kind of people who secretly plant tobacco seedlings, using vendettas or armed fights as a cover. Originally, in this Xikang territory with special folk customs, the people often have the deepest personal grievances. Because of a small matter, they often gather a number of people and guns and fight each other, staging a bloody tragedy, or they occupy a certain strategic location and guard each other, making a self-defense demonstration. In this situation, everyone also secretly plants tobacco seedlings in the area they occupy and reaps the benefits. For example, such phenomena have occurred in Tianquan, Shixing, Lushan, and Danba counties. If the government sends troops to eradicate them, they deliberately fabricate their words, saying that the government is partial to private feuds and helps the other party, so they do not hesitate to make all sacrifices to resist with arms and protect the growth of tobacco seedlings.</p>
<p>**Difficulty in Eradicating Seedlings**</p>
<p>The eradication work of tobacco seedlings in the Yi area every year is not thorough, which is undeniable. Since the Yi area has been planting tobacco for a very long time, it has not been eradicated even in other years when the strictest and most thorough prohibition policies were implemented. Because these Yi people are all unassimilated people, they have never obeyed the government's laws. If you want to thoroughly eradicate them, you must gather all the Yi people, who will not only resist eradication, but also invade and plunder the Han Chinese area, causing an irreparable great chaos. This prohibition policy has a considerable relationship with Yi affairs, and is definitely not comparable to the Han area.</p>
<p>When it comes to harvesting tobacco juice in the places where tobacco seedlings are secretly planted, people who seek profit outside exchange rice and cloth, and also smuggle prohibited items such as bullets and guns to exchange with people who plant tobacco. As a result, the private military power in the tobacco planting area is increasing day by day, and in addition, most of those who sell tobacco are people who are not afraid of things in society, and they have become dens for hooligans and bandits to do evil. Of course, it will have a considerable impact on social order, especially in the Yi area, everything can only be exchanged for guns, ammunition, and silver. When those things flow into the Yi area, it goes without saying that it is a most terrible phenomenon of lawlessness, which naturally increases the difficulty in solving the Yi affairs problem.</p>
<p>**Cause and Effect**</p>
<p>The Xikang authorities have put in a lot of effort on the inseparable problems of tobacco and bandits and tobacco and Yi affairs, because to thoroughly suppress bandits, it is necessary to strictly prohibit the planting of opium, so as to avoid the lingering of unscrupulous elements. At the same time, to thoroughly eradicate opium, it is necessary to suppress the bandits of unscrupulous elements, so as to prevent evil forces from doing evil. To solve Yi affairs, it is necessary to prohibit opium, so as to avoid external support. To thoroughly prohibit opium, it is also necessary to solve the Yi affairs problem, and the law can be effective only when it is in-depth. These cause-and-effect problems are really not simple. Between the 35th and 36th years, the authorities made their best efforts, not hesitating to sacrifice everything, to thoroughly eradicate tobacco seedlings, and the Tianrong incident occurred. Those who did not know the inside story at the time thought it was a civil uprising, but how could it be a civil uprising? In fact, it was a bloody fact that was staged to resist eradication. Another example is the suppression of Puxiong Yiyi, which is one of the solutions to the Yi affairs problem. How could it be a war of Yi people rebellion?</p>
<p>**Permanent Stability**</p>
<p>This year, due to the emergency of the war to quell the chaos in the front, some unscrupulous elements are taking advantage of this turbulent situation and are thinking of secretly doing the business of secretly planting tobacco seedlings again. However, in order to strengthen the stability work in the rear, maintain social security, and increase the strength of the front to quell the chaos, the Xikang authorities have made drug eradication and bandit suppression the important tasks at the moment, and have ordered Yuan Pinwen, deputy director of the Ningzhu Committee, and Wu Peiying, who is stationed in the army, as well as Liu Yuanxuan and Wang Zhiren, who are stationed in the army in Yushu, to be responsible for handling it. Now the persons in charge of these two areas have separately convened a meeting of the county magistrates and the speakers and deputy speakers of the council of each county and the military officers stationed in the county, and the ultimate principle is to effectively connect between provinces and counties and thoroughly handle it. Everyone in the military, government, and people must cooperate, be consistent from top to bottom, so that no tobacco seedlings appear, and there is no bandit, to accomplish the task and stabilize this Shangri-La Xikang for a long time.</p>

<h3>The National Bank Throws Out Huge Amounts of Foreign Exchange, the Money Market Has Become Tight</h3>
<p>According to related sources, the Central Bank threw out foreign exchange certificates in the market the day before yesterday, estimated to be over US$120,000 in one day. Yesterday, it secretly entrusted the China and Communications Banks to sell US$600,000. This is a rare phenomenon since the currency reform, and all parties are paying close attention.</p>
<p>The Central Bank's exchange rate for overseas remittances was adjusted for the twelfth time to 110 yuan per US dollar yesterday, an increase of another 10 yuan. The opening of the foreign exchange transfer certificate market was weak. Banks and bureaus bought at 114 yuan and sold at 115 yuan. Designated banks bought at 109 yuan and sold at 110 yuan. The market supply exceeded demand, and prices trended downward. In the afternoon market, the buying price was 103 yuan and the selling price was 105 yuan.</p>
<p>The city's money supply, which has been loose for a long time, has become tight in recent days due to the soaring prices of goods and the urgent demand from various industries. The Central Bank's contraction of floating funds and recovery of balances has reached more than 100 million yuan. Therefore, yesterday's trend has become tight. The highest overnight lending rate in the market reached 50 yuan per day, and generally 40 yuan or 45 yuan. Compared with the day before yesterday, the increase was doubled, which is quite alarming. The industry is urging the repayment of loans, which makes the city's turnover even more difficult. It is expected that the tight situation will become even worse today.</p>
<p>Cash chips were also tight yesterday because the bank and village were generally short of orders the day before yesterday, resulting in a rare balance deposited in the Central Bank. Yesterday, it was impossible to withdraw cash, and the year-end is approaching. The wages and year-end bonuses of employees in the industrial and commercial sectors in the second half of the month are approaching, and there is a great need for funds. It is said that there is also a discount on general cash, and the banks and villages repeatedly restrict cash withdrawals, about 500 yuan or 1,000 yuan. It is said that there are people in the market who offer 60 yuan or 70 yuan for overnight balances.</p>
<h3>Money Market Tight, People's Hearts Vacillating, Rice Prices Begin to Fall, Flour Plummets, Coarse Grains and Cooking Oil Drop Sharply</h3>
<p>The rice market turned down yesterday because other goods had already fallen first, and people's hearts were also weakening. In addition, the money market was very tight at the end of the year, and there was not much demand. There were more transactions in the early market, and prices immediately dropped by 20 to 30 yuan (nearly 100 yuan lower than the shouting price at the close of the previous day). Transactions in the middle market were sparse. White japonica rice was 670 yuan, thin indica rice was 680 yuan, and early indica rice was 660 yuan. At the close of the market, the downward trend was even more sluggish, and prices fell again by 20 to 30 yuan as described above. Thin indica rice closed at 650 yuan, a decrease of 60 to 70 yuan compared to the closing price of the previous day, and a decrease of more than 100 yuan compared to the shouting price after the closing of the previous day. The situation in the north market was the same. Only 8,353 shi of goods arrived in the north and south markets yesterday.</p>
<p>**Flour**</p>
<p>The market situation plummeted because people's hearts were stabilized by the resumption of gold exchange and storage. Various goods outside the industry fell sharply. The cargo owners took advantage of the high prices to sell out, and there was a sound of selling in the market. The opening price of old car flour was 285 yuan, and then it fell to 272 yuan at the close, a sharp drop of 87 yuan. The closing price of battleship flour was 262 yuan, a sharp drop of 93 yuan. Miscellaneous brands of flour were all opened in the after-market, and prices fell uniformly by 80 to 90 yuan. Wheat bran also followed suit and fell sharply by 47 yuan.</p>
<p>**Coarse Grains**</p>
<p>They all fell sharply because all goods saw a return wind. The decision to resume gold exchange and storage stabilized people's hearts, and the cargo owners took advantage of the high prices to sell out. Hankou peas fell straight to 370 yuan, a sharp drop of 180 yuan. There were more shipments of corn than purchases, a decrease of nearly 100 yuan. Red sorghum also fell sharply by 100 yuan, and there were still few households paying taxes. Green beans fell rapidly by 50%, sesame also fell sharply by 200 to 300 yuan. Raw peanuts were not taken by the Ke Bang, and sales were sluggish, falling by 400 yuan.</p>
<p>**Cooking Oil**</p>
<p>The downtrend was fierce because gold exchange and storage resumed, commodity prices outside the industry fell, and year-end closing, the money market tightened suddenly. The cargo owners rushed to sell, and the soybean oil factories also opened their prices, the highest being 2,300 yuan, and the closing price was 2,150 yuan. Rapeseed oil retreated to within 2,000 yuan, closing at 1,950 yuan, all falling sharply by 400 yuan. The closing price of Jitone raw oil was as low as 2,000 yuan. The market for sesame oil was also extremely weak. There were more bean cakes on the market than purchases, with a decrease of 47 yuan and the spot price for raw peanut cake at 153 yuan.</p>
<h3>Bank and Village Increase Capital and Transfer Deposits by Today</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Finance has made a final decision on the issue of bank and village capital increase, that is, the cash part will still be transferred for deposit and can be used at any time, but it must be approved by the Financial Management Bureau. It is learned that the Banking Association convened a meeting on the 29th and decided to comply with the law. Yesterday morning, an emergency notice was sent to all member banks and villages. Regarding the transfer of the cash part of the bank and village capital increase to the Central Bank for deposit, a quick telegram was received from the Ministry of Finance, stating that the deposit should be transferred to the Central Bank for verification by December 31. As for the use of funds, the government has decided to give a reasonable and generous flexible approach, and is currently discussing it, and it will be announced in early January.</p>
<p>The reporter recently visited authoritative figures in the industry about the transfer and deposit of the cash part of the bank and village capital increase. It was reported that this move indicates that the government has decided to concede to the requests of the banking industry, and the transfer for verification is only a routine procedure. It is expected that it can be used at the beginning of the new year. The bank and village authorities have long been prepared for the cash capital increase, so it does not affect the industry's balance.</p>
<h3>Bank and Village Check Exchange Extended by One Hour Today, Exchange Regulations in Six Articles</h3>

<h3>Taiwan Soda Adjusts Prices</h3>
<p>Taiwan Soda Company has information: The company has four factories in Taiwan, two factories are located at 424 Caoya Street, Gaoxiong, Taiwan, and two factories are located at 1001 Anping Road, Tainan. The current monthly output is about 600 tons, 5/3 of which are supplied to Taiwan Sugar Company, and the rest are sold overseas.

If paper mills, yarn mills, etc. in this city have legitimate needs, they can contact the factory's Shanghai office for negotiation.</p>
<h3>Cigarettes Fall Back by 20%</h3>
<p>The cigarette market, because it is heard that gold exchange and storage will still be implemented, the money supply will tend to be tight, there is a lot of floating capital, and because the banks and villages are closed for several days, the interest rates are unbearable, and the sale is very strong. The market situation suddenly plummeted due to lack of demand. At the close, it was slightly stable. The price of Jia Li Ke fell by 40 yuan compared with yesterday, to 120 yuan. The price of 3-5 also fell by 35 yuan to 210 yuan.</p>
<h3>Soviet Coal Arrives in Shanghai by Jin</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper] According to the American Shipping Company yesterday, the Greek ship Konis Qiao has transported 9,450 tons of coal from Vladivostok, and will return to the Soviet Union in about two days.</p>
<h3>A Batch of Green Tea for Export Has Been Officially Traded at US$0.95 per Kilogram</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper] According to export sources: China's tea exports have become active because of the French economic delegation's purchase for French North Africa. The total purchase volume is 500 tons, all green tea, priced at US$0.95 per kilogram, jointly supplied by Shanghai tea exporters. It has been officially traded and will be shipped and exported after the New Year next year. Therefore, the tea market has improved recently. Because there is not much tea in stock in Shanghai, after this batch of transactions is successful, most of the stock has been cleared.</p>
<p>Another news: Red and green tea, because the licensees saw the sudden surge of goods outside the circle the day before yesterday, affecting the reproduction cost, and also because of the scarce tea stocks, although the money supply is tightening and the market interest rates are increasing, they are not restricted at all. They are all trying to hold on to their attitudes, and the shouting price is skyrocketing, so the upward trend and the prices are even more amazing. Because of the narrow supply source, there were only a few transactions in the end.</p>
<h3>Sluggish Buying, Quiet Trading: Cotton Yarn and Cloth Fall Across the Board; 42-Count Blue Phoenix Falls 3,500 Yuan</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the yarn market halted its rise and began to fall. Since the 20th, the upward trend had been unstoppable, finally reaching an unprecedented peak. Although this was due to loose monetary policy, there was also suspicion of opportunistic price gouging. However, with high prices comes the risk of decline, and extremes are followed by reversals. Therefore, yesterday, all yarns declined uniformly.</p>
<p>42-count Blue Phoenix opened at a low of 33,000 yuan. Midway, there were still many who sought to buy at lower prices, and the market closed briskly at 36,500 yuan, a decrease of 3,500 yuan from the previous day. 40-count Blue Phoenix fell 4,300 yuan. 32-count Silver Moon initially opened at 27,500 yuan, once reaching 30,500 yuan, but finally returned to 30,000 yuan at the close.</p>
<p>21-count Double Horse spot goods started at 26,500 yuan, reaching a low of 23,500 yuan, and ultimately settling at 24,500 yuan, a drop of 4,000 yuan. Factory orders decreased by 3,000 yuan, closing at 23,000 yuan. One-day arbitrage was done at 700 yuan. 20-count Double Horse fell 3,000 yuan to 22,500 yuan. 16-count Bright Light and Boy Scout each fell 2,000 yuan to 3,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Cotton cloth plummeted across the board. It was rumored that gold would resume convertibility, and that the money supply in the market was tightening. Furthermore, it was the end of the year, and the market would be closed for five days starting today. Therefore, both buyers and sellers were wary. Large and small traders were cautious and prudent, and trading within the market was quiet.</p>
<p>Fine Dragon Head cloth initially opened at 900 yuan, and Four Gentlemen Yuan Serge at 850 yuan. Subsequently, bulls sought to buy at lower prices, and the market rebounded slightly, with prices slightly recovering. Finally, the former closed at 960 yuan, and the latter at 900 yuan, a rapid decline of 200 to 250 yuan from the previous day. The quality of Four Gentlemen Yuan Serge rose from 870 yuan to a high of 930 yuan, closing at 910 yuan, a final drop of 240 yuan. Although the quotations of other cloth factories opened low, not much business was done.</p>
<h3>China Textile Corporation Sells Off Yarn and Cloth; Proceeds from Yarn Sales Reach 4 Million Gold Yuan</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the China Textile Corporation, acting on behalf of the US Aid Flower Yarn and Cloth Joint Venture, sold 106 pieces of 42-count two-ply Blue Phoenix yarn at 37,000 yuan per piece, for a total price of 3,922,000 yuan.

<p>It is also reported that the cotton yarn market will be closed for four days from New Year's Day to the 4th as usual, and will reopen on the 5th with the new year's opening price.</p>
<h3>Cotton Cloth, Cigarette, and Other Markets to Close Today for the New Year; Only the Cotton Yarn Market Remains Open as Usual</h3>
<p>Today is the Lunar New Year's Eve of the 37th year. To reorganize their operations for the past year, various markets, including cotton cloth, rayon, cigarettes, daily necessities, cooking oil, rice, sugar, miscellaneous grains, and flour, have decided to close early starting today. Only the cotton yarn market will remain open as usual today, and will close starting tomorrow. All these markets are scheduled to reopen on January 4th of next year, according to reports.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market Declines</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market saw Taiwan Sugar Corporation selling special grade white sugar on behalf of the National Bank. The industry's finances were tight, and prices had risen excessively, leading to caution. Overall, the market for various goods weakened, and many speculative positions were liquidated, resulting in a soft market. No. 45 grade white sugar opened at a soft price of 1,100 yuan and continued to decline throughout the day, closing at 1,050 yuan, a sharp drop of 400 yuan. Coarse sugar fell 390 yuan, and various other grades fell by about 400 yuan each.</p>
<h3>Wood Market Softens</h3>
<p>The upward trend in the wood market has come to a halt, and plywood has begun to decline. 3'x6' plywood opened at 42 yuan, and 3'x7' plywood opened at 50 yuan, each falling by more than ten yuan. Foreign pine and pine boards have remained stable, but fir strips remain firm due to their use in doors and other frequently sold items. The market opened at 3.5 yuan, with transactions occurring at 3.3 yuan and 3.2 yuan. However, industry observers believe that the wood market will soften.</p>
<h3>Sino-French Industrial and Commercial Bank to Close Today</h3>
<p>The person in charge of the French Sino-French Industrial and Commercial Bank stated that the bank, under the orders of its Paris headquarters, will close its banking operations in its Shanghai branch today. All unfinished matters will be transferred to the French Banque de l'Indochine for continued handling. At the same time, a financial office will be established at the original location to focus on investment business, according to reports.</p>

<h3>Sino-Dutch Barter Trade Begins; First Batch Worth 50,000 Pounds; Barter Trade with Japan Also to Be Relaxed Starting Next Year</h3>
<p>The barter trade between our country and the Netherlands has now been approved by the Import and Export Control Commission. It is learned that the first batch of barter goods is worth 50,000 pounds, a considerable amount. The barter trade between China and the Netherlands can be expanded from this. The export authorities are currently purchasing fine grass mats from Central and Southern China, preparing to concentrate them for sale in the Netherlands. The Dutch side will soon ship a batch of Western medicines to China. Dutch barter goods with our country in the future will mainly consist of Western medicines, according to reports.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the restrictions on barter trade between our country and Japan will also be relaxed starting next year to expand the scope of business, according to reports.</p>
<h3>Silk Prices Decline</h3>
<p>The rayon market continued to decline yesterday. The market for various external goods continued to decline, and credit tightened suddenly, with interest rates rising. Furthermore, with the New Year holidays approaching, banks will close, and the market will be closed for several days. Holding goods incurs high interest, and the risk is high, so many speculative positions were eager to liquidate.</p>
<p>120-count Tianqiao opened at 33,000 yuan in the morning. There were more sellers than buyers, and major players settled their accounts, causing the market to weaken. The market declined again, falling below the 30,000 yuan mark, hovering between 28,500 yuan and 29,000 yuan for a long time. By the close, credit had eased slightly, and many short positions were also arranged, causing buying interest to increase. Prices rose back to 30,000 yuan, and finally closed at 31,000 yuan, down 2,000 yuan compared to the previous day's closing price. In the afternoon, long positions were bought on small dips, and the black market price of gold and banknotes rose, improving sentiment and revitalizing the market. 120-count Tianqiao was traded at 33,300 yuan, up 2,500 yuan from the morning session. Dongyang, Jin Sanma, Siniya, Xishi, and other brands all initially moved flat to soft, and rose at the close. Dongyang was traded at 33,700 yuan in the afternoon, also up 2,500 yuan from the morning session. The upward and downward trends of other grades were the same.</p>
<p>The raw silk market was initially flat and then softened yesterday. Due to the wild fluctuations in market prices and the high risks, foreign firms were cautious, and credit was generally tight. Initially, it was heard that the market for various external goods was relatively flat, and prices were relatively stable. Later, due to the overall softening trend, there was continuous selling to obtain cash. Grade D 7/8 evenness opened at 40,500 yuan, and premium odd lots opened at 39,000 yuan. Midday saw small retailers selling off, and trading was quiet, causing prices to fall. Grade D fell to 37,500 yuan, and premium fell to 36,500 yuan. In the afternoon, due to the rise in rayon and the apparent stabilization of the market for various external goods, and a slight increase in the black market price of gold and banknotes, prices rose after softening. Grade D was quoted at 41,000 yuan, and premium was quoted at 39,000 yuan, both up from the morning session.</p>
<p>The silk and satin market was initially down and then up yesterday. After the opening, sentiment was weak, and major players sold off to obtain cash. There was strong selling pressure. Furthermore, with the market closing for several days around the New Year, many small retailers planned to profit from interest, and sold off to lend money. As a result, the market became increasingly unsustainable. Meiya opened at 18,000 yuan, and Huaqiang opened at 17,800 yuan. There were more sellers than buyers, and the trend was weak, causing prices to decline. Meiya fell to 17,200 yuan, and Huaqiang fell to 17,000 yuan, hovering at low prices. Trading seemed sluggish. After the morning, credit tightened and then eased, and short positions were covered, causing prices to rise after softening. Meiya closed at 19,500 yuan, and Huaqiang closed at 19,400 yuan. Transactions outside the market were done at 100 to 200 yuan higher, but the result was still a decline.</p>

<h3>A Difficult to Break Stalemate: Air Force Academy Wins Narrowly Against Renyu; 49 to 47, a Difference of Two Points; Liao Xuewen's Throw Decides the Victory</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] In yesterday's basketball friendly match, the Hangzhou Air Force Academy narrowly defeated Renyu 49 to 47 by two points. The score was 22 to 21 at halftime. The battle was tense and close throughout, attracting hundreds of spectators, which was unexpected. Cheers erupted in the City Gymnasium.</p>
<p>In the first half, the Air Force Academy's Zhu Shengyi, Liao Xuewen, and You Jianxing were the most agile and active, while Renyu's Wu Xinyun was more lively. The Air Force Academy worked hard to intercept the ball, and with Shengyi's brilliant shooting, the Air Force Academy led Renyu by one point at halftime, 22 to 21. In the second half, Renyu initially maintained a back-and-forth situation, but after ten minutes, chaos broke out, with players acting individually, and the Air Force Academy dominated. They often led by four or five points. The later part of the game became a fierce battle between the two sides. In the end, the Air Force Academy's Liao Xuewen scored a basket as the buzzer sounded, giving the Air Force Academy a narrow victory over Renyu by two points. Zhu Shengyi of the Air Force Academy and Wu Xinyun of Renyu each scored 22 points. The starting lineups for both sides were: Renyu: Wu Xinyun, Li Zhaohe, Yao Wenyi, Le Jiazhou, Sun Guozheng; Air Force Academy: Zhu Shengyi, Liao Xuewen, You Jianxing, Sun Huanting, Yuan Fuchu. The Air Force Academy's You missed a free throw, and Renyu's Le Jiazhou made a free throw to open the scoring. The Air Force Academy's Zhu Shengyi intercepted the ball in the air and scored, creating momentum. Renyu replaced Le with Zhuang Yirong, and the defense became stricter. Only two to one was scored in five minutes. Zhu Shengyi scored again, and Renyu's Xinyun, Yirong, and Guozheng scored frequently, giving Renyu a 9-6 lead. The Air Force Academy replaced Yuan Shixian with Liao Xuewen, and Yuan made contributions, only falling behind by one point. The scores were close, and the Air Force Academy surpassed Renyu several times. Xu Shuyuan scored a basket, making the score 21 to 18, and Renyu raised its head again. Shengyi performed exceptionally well, and the Air Force Academy led Renyu by one point, 22 to 21, at halftime.</p>
<p>After the break, Xinyun scored a basket, taking the lead. The scores between the two sides rose and fell. The Air Force Academy's passing was particularly magical, and they suddenly took a 32 to 27 lead of five points. Renyu gradually became flustered. After struggling, Renyu gradually caught up. Wenyi scored a basket, making the score 39 to 38, finally giving them a breath of air. Jiazhou seemed to have divine help, making every free throw, but by focusing on the front and neglecting the rear, they gave the other side a point, making the score 42 to 41. With five minutes remaining, Wenyi scored a long shot, changing the situation again. Shengyi of the Air Force Academy and Xinyun each played for their own team. Renyu called its sixth timeout with the score at 45 to 44. At this moment, Liao Xuewen of the Air Force Academy made a free throw to tie the score. He then scored another basket to add two points. Renyu failed to take advantage of two free throw opportunities, and Xinyun scored a long shot, tying the score at 47. Who knew that Liao Xuewen would grab the ball and score, giving the Air Force Academy a narrow victory over Renyu by two points, 49 to 47.</p>

<h3>Yinqian Cup Table Tennis Tournament Concludes; Zhejiang Xing Team Wins Second Place</h3>

China Yellow and Zhejiang Xing, two strong teams, competed for second place. Chen Linsheng, Wu Lianquan, and Zhu Xiguang served as referees. China Yellow had no hope of winning the championship due to their loss to Siming the night before, so their morale was low and they fell behind. They were unable to catch up, with only Zhu Yongkang defeating three Zhejiang Xing players, maintaining his veteran status. Under the leadership of team leader Wu Zhaofeng, Zhejiang Xing's players fought hard. As a result, Zhejiang Xing defeated China Yellow 13 to 5, winning second place. China Yellow fell to third place. The championship was won by Siming. The entire final schedule of the tournament has been successfully completed. The complete list of rankings is recorded below:</p>
